In order to implement Chairman Mao's instructions on launching a struggle against bureaucracy among leading organs and leading cadres at all levels, the Northeast Administrative Committee first started with inspecting the handling of letters from the people. From February 20th, it preliminarily inspected the work of handling letters from the people in its affiliated commissions and bureaus. Preliminary inspections revealed that some departments paid relatively close attention to and implemented the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council regarding the handling of letters from the people and receiving people. For example, the General Office, Civil Affairs Bureau, and Education Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee had dedicated personnel to handle letters from the people, and generally established systems for registration, transfer, inspection, urging, and closing cases. Those who conscientiously handled letters from the people, solved problems for the people, and promptly improved government work, strengthened the relationship between the government and the people, enhanced the government's prestige among the people, and also increased the people's political consciousness and enthusiasm for building the motherland. For example, in July 1952, the former General Office of the Northeast People's Government received a letter from farmers in Zhichun Village, Fifth District, Hailong County, Liaodong Province, exposing the illegal and undisciplined behavior of Sun Zhicheng, the village's public security committee member. It immediately instructed the Liaodong Provincial People's Government to handle the matter seriously. After investigation, it was found to be true, and Sun Zhicheng was arrested and punished according to law. The farmers in the village, seeing that the government could quickly accept the people's opinions, more actively continued to expose the bad people and bad deeds in the village with a sense of ownership. At the same time, and more importantly, this inspection revealed that many departments did not truly recognize the political significance of this work, and therefore adopted a serious bureaucratic attitude towards letters from the people. Among the eighteen departments inspected this time, twelve of them had neither set up special personnel or designated special personnel to be responsible for the work of handling letters from the people, nor established sound systems for registration, research, transfer, inspection, urging, closing cases, and summarizing. For example, the Health Bureau (formerly the Health Department of the Northeast People's Government) had never had special personnel responsible for handling letters from the people. Although a system for handling letters from the people was formulated in 1952, it was never implemented. Therefore, it is now impossible to ascertain how many letters from the people were received over the years, whether all these letters were processed, and whether all of them were processed correctly. The leading personnel of the bureau were indifferent to this work. Even today, when the struggle against bureaucracy is being carried out, they still use excuses such as "difficult to investigate" and "the person originally responsible for this work has been transferred away" to avoid actively inspecting and trying to clean up and improve this work.

Many departments have long accumulated letters from the people, delaying thorough handling, and finally casually filing them away; or they shirk responsibility to each other, transferring the letters back and forth, even transferring them to the criticized and reported organs for handling, so that the problems raised in the letters from the people have not been resolved for a long time. For example, the former General Office of the Northeast People's Government received a letter from workers on February 28, 1952, requesting that the problem of winter heating coal be solved for the 90 employees of their factory. The General Office immediately telephoned the Machinery Bureau (formerly the Machinery Bureau of the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government), and the bureau said that it should be solved by the Ordnance Department of the Northeast Military Region. Therefore, the General Office transferred the letter to the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region; but soon the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region returned the letter, saying that the problem should still be solved by the Machinery Bureau. Then, the General Office treated it as an employee welfare problem and transferred all the materials to the former Personnel Department of the Northeast People's Government; soon the Personnel Department also returned the materials, saying that the problem should be solved by the former Civil Affairs Department of the Northeast People's Government. When the General Office handed the materials to the Civil Affairs Department, the department again said that the Northeast Military Region Ordnance Department should be responsible. In this way, several departments pushed back and forth, delaying for half a year, and the problem was not solved; finally, the General Office filed it away with the reason of "unable to handle." Up to now, after two winters, the heating coal problem has not been solved. For another example, the Forest Industry General Bureau of the former Forestry Department of the Northeast People's Government received a letter from the people on April 18, 1952, which put forward several rationalization proposals on timber making and storage. This was originally a matter that the bureau should handle, but the bureau did not seriously study it and transferred it to the Office of the former Northeast Forestry Department. Later, the Office of the Forestry Department handed it over to the Forest Policy Division of the department. After receiving it, the Forest Policy Division did not take it seriously and suppressed it until it was recently discovered during an archive inspection. This rationalization proposal has been accumulated for nearly ten months, and has been returned to the current Northeast Forest Industry Administration in its original form, and has not yet been finally processed.

For example, after the Liaodong Provincial People's Government mistakenly approved the arrest of a person (falsely accused of being a counter-revolutionary) who had accused a bad village cadre by the Liaoyang County People's Government, the case information was reported to the former General Office of the Northeast People's Government, but the General Office did not conduct any research and considered it a "closed case" and filed it away. As a result, this major error was not corrected in time (it has now been inspected and corrected). In September 1952, the Northeast Branch of the Supreme People's Court transferred the letter from the masses criticizing the Fushun Municipal People's Court to the Fushun Municipal People's Court for handling, and the problems reflected in it have not yet been resolved.

From this preliminary inspection, the bureaucratic phenomena existing in the handling of letters from the people in the departments under the Northeast Administrative Committee are very serious and intolerable. If it is not changed immediately, it will inevitably alienate the connection between the Party, the government, and the masses of the people. The reason for these phenomena is mainly that the leading organs and responsible cadres do not pay attention to the handling of letters from the people, lack the necessary regular supervision, inspection, and leadership for this work, and are indifferent to the specific problems of the people and do not care. This harmful thinking and behavior must be resolutely overcome.

Based on the results of this inspection and after summarizing the handling of letters from the people in 1952, the General Office of the Northeast Administrative Committee proposed methods to improve the handling of letters from the people:

1.  Each department must set up full-time cadres or designate special personnel to handle letters from the people, and further establish and improve the systems for registration, transfer, urging, reviewing the handling results, answering, and filing of letters from the people.

	(1) Cases of exposure and accusation should be transferred to the higher-level organ in charge for investigation and handling, and should not be transferred to the person or unit being accused for handling. In case of major cases, investigations must be organized, and no transfer should be done casually.

	(2) Speed up the transfer time and eliminate the backlog. All letters that need to be transferred for handling should be transferred within five days of receipt at the latest. All cases within the scope of responsibility of each department shall not be excused and delay the time.

	(3) Insist on implementing the urging system. For letters transferred for processing and requiring a report on the results, if no reply is received after 20 days after the transfer, a reminder shall be issued (cases that cannot be processed within 20 days should explain the reasons). If no reply is received after three reminders, a public criticism or disciplinary action shall be given.

	(4) The handling results must be studied. It is stipulated that Friday afternoons should be set aside as the time for specialized study of the handling results of letters from the people, in order to review whether the handling of cases is accurate and the work of each undertaking department. If a reply is required, it should be given in a timely manner.

	(5) For letters of exposure, accusation, request, invention, suggestion, inquiry, etc., the result must be achieved and the letter writer must be answered.

2.  Clean up backlog cases and inspect the handled cases: Before April 1953, the cases transferred for processing in 1952 that have not yet been completed should be accelerated and strived to be basically completed; and the cases closed in 1952 should be inspected once, and the cases that have been handled improperly and the masses still have opinions should be re-processed.

3.  Strengthen inspection work. In the future, in addition to the more important cases, the General Office will personally participate in the inspection and understanding, and will often focus on inspecting the handling of letters from the people in the Northeast-level organs and in the provinces and cities, so as to discover problems and deal with them at any time.

4.  In the future, a review and summary will be conducted every six months, and each directly affiliated department will submit a summary report to the Northeast Administrative Committee every six months.

5.  In the future, the work of letters from the people must be paid attention to, handled conscientiously and responsibly, and discipline must be strengthened. Departments with achievements in their work will be commended; departments that are irresponsible, perfunctory, accumulate and lose letters from the people, and do not pay attention to the handling of letters from the people will be publicly criticized, and in serious cases, the responsible cadres of the organs will be given disciplinary action.

    东北行政委员会在反官僚主义斗争中检查纠正许多机关不重视人民来信的现象
    为了贯彻毛主席关于在各级领导机关和领导干部中开展反对官僚主义斗争的指示，东北行政委员会首先从检查处理人民来信工作入手，自二月二十日起，初步检查了所属各委、局的处理人民来信工作。经初步检查，有些部门是比较重视和执行了中央人民政府政务院关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定。如东北行政委员会办公厅、民政局和教育局等部门，都有专人处理人民来信，并一般的建立了登记、转办、检查、催办和结案等制度。凡认真处理了人民来信，给人民解决了问题，并及时改进了政府工作的，就密切了政府和人民的关系，提高了政府在人民中的威信，也提高了人民的政治觉悟和建设祖国的积极性。如原东北人民政府办公厅在一九五二年七月间接到辽东省海龙县第五区支前村农民揭发该村公安委员孙志成违法乱纪的信，立即责成辽东省人民政府负责认真处理，后经查明确实，随将孙志成逮捕法办。该村农民一看政府能迅速接受人民意见，所以更加积极地以主人翁态度继续揭发该村的坏人坏事。同时，更重要的是通过这次检查，发现了很多部门没有真正认识这个工作的政治意义，因而采取了严重的官僚主义态度来对待人民来信。这次检查的十八个部门中，就有十二个部门的处理人民来信工作既没有设专人或指定专人负责，也没有建立健全的登记、研究、转办、检查、催办、结案和总结等制度。如卫生局（原东北人民政府卫生部）的处理人民来信工作，一向无专人负责，一九五二年虽曾订过一个处理人民来信工作的制度，但根本没有实行。因此，几年来究竟接到多少人民来信，对这些来信是否都处理了和是否都处理得正确，现在皆无法查清。该局领导人员对这一工作漠不关心，甚至当开展反对官僚主义斗争的今天，他们还以“不好查”“原来负责此项工作的人已调走了”等为藉口，不积极检查和想法清理、改进这一工作。
    有不少部门把人民来信长期积压，拖着不作彻底处理，最后草率归档了事；或互相推诿，把信转来转去，甚至转到被批评检举的机关去处理，以致人民来信提出的问题长期得不到解决。如原东北人民政府办公厅在一九五二年二月二十八日接到一封工人来信，要求给他们厂九十名职工解决冬季取暖煤问题。办公厅当即挂电话问机械局（原东北人民政府工业部机械局），该局说应由东北军区军械部解决。于是办公厅就将信转交东北军区政治部；而不久东北军区政治部将信退回，说此问题仍应由机械局解决。接着办公厅又当作职工福利问题将全部材料转交原东北人民政府人事部；不久人事部也将材料退回，说此问题应由原东北人民政府民政部解决。当办公厅将材料交民政部时，该部又说应由东北军区军械部负责。就这样几个部门推来推去，拖了半年，问题也没解决；最后办公厅也就以“无法办理”为理由归档了事。直到现在过了两冬，这个取暖煤问题也未解决。又如原东北人民政府林业部森林工业总局一九五二年四月十八日收到一封人民来信，信中提出了几项关于制材和保管木材的合理化建议。这本来是该局应办的事，但该局却未认真研究，就转给了原东北林业部办公室。以后林业部办公室又交给该部林政处办理。林政处接到后，就不当一回事给压下了，直到最近检查档案才发现。这项合理化建议积压了将近十个月，又原封不动地转回现在的东北森林工业管理局，尚未得到最后的处理。
    又如辽东省人民政府错误地批准辽阳县人民政府将控告坏村干部的人（被诬为反革命分子）逮捕后，将案情报给原东北人民政府办公厅，而办公厅未加任何研究就认为是“已结案件”，归档了事。致使这一重大错误未被及时纠正（现已检查纠正）。最高人民法院东北分院在一九五二年九月间，将群众写的批评抚顺市人民法院的信转交给抚顺市人民法院来处理，直到现在所反映的问题还未获得解决。
    从这次初步检查来看，东北行政委员会所属各部门在处理人民来信工作上所存在的官僚主义现象是十分严重的，也是不能容忍的；如不予立即转变，势必疏远党、政府和人民群众的联系。产生这些现象的原因，主要是领导机关和负责干部不重视处理人民来信工作，缺乏对这一工作应有的经常督促检查和领导，对人民的具体问题漠不关心，不闻不问。这种有害的思想和行为必须坚决克服。
    东北行政委员会办公厅根据这次检查的结果，并在总结了一九五二年处理人民来信的基础上，提出了改进处理人民来信工作的办法：
    一、各部门必须设专职干部或指定专人处理人民来信，进一步建立与健全人民来信工作的登记、转办、催办、审查处理结果、答复、归档等制度。
    （1）凡检举、控告的案件，应转给其该管的上一级机关调查处理，不得转给本人或被控单位办理。遇有重大案件必须组织调查，不得一转了事。
    （2）加速转办时间，消灭积压现象。凡需转出处理的信件，最迟于收信后五日内转办完毕。凡各部门在责任范围内之案件，不得借故推诿，拖延时间。
    （3）坚持执行催办制度，凡转出处理并要回报结果的信件，于转出后一般的过二十天未作答复者，即行催办（在二十天内不能处理完毕的案件，应说明理由），催办三次仍不答复，予以通报批评或处分。
    （4）对处理结果，必须进行研究，规定每星期五下午为专门研究处理人民来信结果的时间，以审查对案件处理是否准确及各承办部门的工作情况，如须作批复的案件则应作到及时批复。
    （5）对检举、控告和提出要求、发明、建议、询问等信件，要做到有结果，并答复来信本人。
    二、清理积案及检查已处理的案件：在一九五三年四月份以前，将一九五二年转出处理尚未得到结果的案件，加紧催办，争取基本上处理完毕；并将一九五二年中已结案件，进行一次检查，对其中处理不当群众仍有意见的案件，予以重新处理。
    三、加强检查工作。今后除较重大的案件，办公厅要亲自参加检查了解外，并经常有重点地检查东北一级机关和各省、市关于处理人民来信工作的情况，从而发现问题，随时处理。
    四、今后要每半年检查总结一次，各直属部门半年向东北行政委员会作一次总结报告。
    五、今后对人民来信工作，必须予以重视，认真负责处理，并加强纪律性。工作有成绩的部门，予以表扬；对不负责任、马虎搪塞、积压和丢失人民来信，不重视处理人民来信的部门，予以公开批评，情节严重者，对该机关负责干部予以纪律处分。
