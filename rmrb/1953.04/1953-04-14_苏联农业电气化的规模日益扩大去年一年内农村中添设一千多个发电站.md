Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: News: The scale of agricultural electrification in the Soviet Union continues to expand. In 1952, 297 hydroelectric power stations and 912 thermal power stations were completed and generated electricity in Soviet rural areas. In addition, 24,000 generators with a total of 150,000 horsepower were added. These power stations and generators electrified 1,085 collective farms and 760 machine tractor stations, afforestation stations, and agricultural machinery repair factories. During the current spring plowing and spring plowing preparations, the labor productivity of these units that were electrified last year has greatly increased. This year, all Soviet machine tractor stations will be basically electrified, and 1,660 more collective farms will be fully electrified. In order to complete this huge task, the Soviet Union will build new power stations on a larger scale this year than last year, erect high-voltage power grids from giant power stations to rural areas, and add many small generators.

In the Rostov Oblast and Stalingrad Oblast, which are within the power supply scope of the great communist construction projects, a number of electric machine tractor stations are being established, and rural high-voltage power grids will be erected this year. In the Stalingrad Oblast, a power grid of pumping stations is being built to use the electricity of the Tsimlyansk hydroelectric station to pump water to irrigate the first 25,000 hectares of arid land. In addition, an electric machine tractor station has been established in the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky District of the Ukrainian Republic, which has been fully electrified. Almost all field work in the district is carried out with electric tractors, electric combines and other electric agricultural machinery.

With the increasing scale of agricultural electrification, the number of rural electrical engineering cadres in the Soviet Union is also increasing year by year. This year, hundreds of hydraulic power technology engineers, electrical experts, etc. will graduate from various advanced technical colleges in the Soviet Union and work at rural power station construction sites and rural power stations. This year, permanent amateur schools related to electrical engineering will be opened at various rural power stations to improve the professional level of on-the-job personnel and train new cadres for further agricultural electrification.

    苏联农业电气化的规模日益扩大去年一年内农村中添设一千多个发电站
    【新华社十三日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联农业电气化规模继续扩大。一九五二年苏联农村有二百九十七个水力发电站、九百十二个火力发电站落成发电，另外添设了总共十五万匹马力的二万四千部发电机，这些发电站和发电机使一千零八十五个集体农庄和七百六十个机器拖拉机站、造林站、农业机器修理厂电气化了。在目前的春耕和春耕准备工作中，这些已在去年电气化的单位的劳动生产率都大大提高。今年苏联所有机器拖拉机站将基本上电气化，全盘电气化的集体农庄将增加一千六百六十个。为了完成这个巨大任务，苏联的农村今年要以比去年更大的规模建设新的电力站，架设从巨型电力站输电到农村的高压电线网，以及添置许多小型发电机。
    在伟大共产主义建设工程供电范围内的罗斯多夫州和斯大林格勒州，正在建立一批电动机器拖拉机站，今年并要架设农村高压电线网。在斯大林格勒州，正在建筑抽水站电力网以利用齐姆良水电站的电力来抽水灌溉第一批二万五千公顷干旱土地。另外，在乌克兰共和国已经全盘电气化的科尔松—谢甫钦科夫斯基区，已经设立了一个电动机器拖拉机站。该区差不多一切田间工作都是用电动拖拉机、电动联合机及其他电动农业机器进行的。
    与农业电气化的规模日益扩大的同时，苏联的农村电气工程干部也一年年增加。今年，将有几百名水力发电技术工程师、电力专家等从苏联各高级技术学院毕业，到农村电力站建筑现场和农村发电站工作。今年各农村电力站将开办有关电气工程的常设业余学校，以提高在职人员的业务水平，并为农业进一步电气化培养新的干部。
