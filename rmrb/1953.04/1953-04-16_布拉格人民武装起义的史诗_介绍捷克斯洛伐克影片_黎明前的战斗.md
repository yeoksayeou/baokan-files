    Screenwriter: Jan Drda Director: Otakar Vávra, Produced by the Czechoslovak Film Studio in 1948

    The film "Fight Before Dawn" depicts the heroic struggle of the people of Prague, under the leadership of the Communist Party, in their armed uprising to welcome liberation during World War II. At that time, on the one hand, the invincible Red Army had already occupied Berlin, destroyed the last lair of the Hitler bandits, and liberated most of Southeast Europe; on the other hand, the last "trump card" of the Nazi bandits – Schörner's army – was retreating towards Prague. This beautiful city, beloved by the Czechoslovak people, was about to be used as the last stronghold of the Nazi bandits. In such a critical situation, the struggle of the people of Prague was extremely arduous. In order to protect their capital, they could not allow the Nazi bandits to carry out destruction in Prague; in order to cooperate with the pursuit of the Soviet Red Army, they could not allow the Nazi bandits to easily escape from Prague; this is the significance of the bloody defense of the Troja Bridge. The film gives a true depiction of this entire battle environment. On the other side of the bridge, the heavy artillery and tanks of the Nazi bandits were gradually approaching, attempting to occupy the entire urban area of Prague and make a last-ditch struggle; on this side of the bridge, the armed people of Prague, without sufficient weapons, without sufficient ammunition, and even without sufficient manpower, but everyone had the determination to defend this glorious city and persisted in fighting. They greeted the Soviet Red Army coming from Germany and the Moravian Highlands with full confidence.

    Participating in the Prague armed uprising were workers, citizens, police, youth, and housewives under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. The film's portrayal of these characters is sketch-like, but each one appears so real, vivid, and leaves a deep impression on people. Let's look at the old worker Hou Shek. The Party asked him to be responsible for defending the Troja Bridge. He led everyone, monitoring the enemy day and night, never letting up in the wind and rain. He understood the significance of defending this bridge. He mobilized everyone to build four lines of defense, to make each line of defense a graveyard for the Nazi bandits. He twice dismissed the suggestion of two young men to blow up the bridge to block the enemy, saying: "The bridge is ours... What if our own people come from the north?... Don't you know who we are waiting for?" When the last position was in difficulty, with less than ten bullets left, Hou Shek's confidence in victory remained unshaken: "We are finished, but Prague will not be finished. In Prague, we still have more than two thousand fortifications." This old worker demonstrated the infinite loyalty of a Communist Party member to the Party and the revolutionary cause in such a critical moment. The film also truthfully and movingly depicts the sincere feelings of this old worker. When the young sergeant said goodbye to him and went to the first line of defense, Hou Shek suddenly asked: "Tell me, sergeant, are you married?" This sentence expresses such deep love, such heavy feelings! He loved his son Bepik, and did not want him to risk the danger of guns and cannons, but when his son secretly went out to become an anti-tank gunner and bravely hit the enemy's tank, the father was both angry and happy. Finally, Bepik was injured and muttered: "Dad, you, you don't scold me!" Hou Shek just nodded calmly. The feelings of this heroic working-class fighter and the feelings of a father are fully expressed.

    The image of the young Polish female warrior Halina is also very prominent. The film's portrayal of this character is skillful. Her first words when she stepped off the rescued prison car were "Give me a gun!" Through those bright eyes, people can see a strong flame of revenge. Czechoslovakia was not her motherland, and she did not know anyone in Prague, but she still fearlessly took up her combat post and guarded the Troja Bridge. The film prominently portrays her heroic character through various shots. When she stood up to hide the young Bepik to prevent the enemy from shooting, she showed the noble quality of sacrificing herself to save others; when searching for lurking Nazi bandits, she showed great resourcefulness; her calmness and strength on the bridge showed her rich combat experience; in the end, when she stood guard on the wasteland of the stonemason's workshop, she gently stroked a blooming lilac flower beside her and said with a smile: "There is a lilac flower here." In this lilac flower, she saw the happy tomorrow of peace. With this final description, the image of the female warrior Halina is unforgettable.

    The film also depicts the images of more ordinary people. That veteran Communist Party member Kruba, who was so calm and composed! With tears in his eyes, he said to the red flag on the Soviet tank: "I suffered so much persecution for it in the past!" That young sergeant, both of his legs were blown off, but he still stretched out his arms and shouted: "Go quickly, comrades, get on the boat!" He asked Halina to leave him a grenade, kissed her goodbye, and then quietly smoked his last cigarette, pulled the fuse of the grenade, and waited for the enemy to rush onto the bridge. That kind mother, Mrs. Nadved, sacrificed her beloved son and then sacrificed herself; she wanted to avenge her son and also to avenge her motherland, but before she had time to fire her second shot, she was killed. The national flag covered her, covering the noble soul of a mother. There was also that patriotic policeman, Bozhuk, that fearless miner, that enthusiastic female tram conductor... All these people's heroes, nurtured and led by the Communist Party, each demonstrated their character in the battle, deeply moving the audience.

    The film vividly depicts the development of the characters' personalities. In the five days and five nights of battle, this group of ordinary people experienced a fiery tempering. Initially, people's ideas were still naive. When the enemy had not yet laid down their weapons, the unarmed masses raised the tricolor national flag and shouted "Long live freedom" in the streets. The miner even prepared to go home and change into new clothes. However, the enemy's gunshots rang out, and the blood of kind people illuminated their eyes. Even the civil servant who said that not shouting "Long live" meant not loving the country knew to go find weapons. They understood that freedom would not be easily obtained. The battle strengthened the people and raised their ideological understanding.

    The people on the Troja Bridge, like the people in the other two thousand fortifications in Prague, like the fighting people in the whole of Czechoslovakia, the whole of Europe, and the whole world, understood why they were fighting and why they were sacrificing. In the sound of artillery fire, the Party spoke to the people through the radio: "We are not only fighting for freedom, but also for a better tomorrow, for the freedom of our next generation! A new country will grow in our blood, a country that will be our own and will be managed by ourselves..."

    Yes, the film "Fight Before Dawn" tells people this truth. (Attached picture)

    The Battle of Prague is over. The heroes who persisted in defending the Troja Bridge welcomed the arrival of the brave Soviet Red Army. The old worker Hou Shek tightly embraced the Soviet Red Army tank driver, celebrating the liberation of Prague.

    布拉格人民武装起义的史诗——介绍捷克斯洛伐克影片“黎明前的战斗”
    袁鹰
    编剧：强·德尔达  导演：奥塔卡·伐弗拉捷克斯洛伐克电影制片厂一九四八年出品
    影片“黎明前的战斗”描写第二次世界大战中布拉格人民在共产党领导下武装起义，迎接解放的英勇斗争。当时，一方面无敌的红军已经占领了柏林，捣毁了希特勒匪徒的最后的巢穴，解放了东南欧大部分国家；另一方面，纳粹匪帮最后一张“王牌”——舒恩纳的军队，正在退向布拉格。这个为捷克斯洛伐克人民所热爱的美丽的城市，就要被作为纳粹匪徒最后顽抗的堡垒。在这样严重的局势下，布拉格人民的斗争是极其艰苦的。为了保卫自己的首都，他们不能让纳粹匪徒在布拉格进行破坏；为了配合苏联红军的追击，他们又不能让纳粹匪徒从布拉格轻易地逃走；这就是浴血坚守特罗亚大桥的意义。影片中对这整个的战斗环境，作了真实的描写。大桥那边，纳粹匪徒的重炮和坦克渐渐逼近，企图占领整个布拉格的市区，作困兽的挣扎；大桥这边，武装起来的布拉格人民，没有足够的武器，没有足够的弹药，甚至没有足够的人力，但是，他们中每一个人都有保卫这个光荣城市的决心，坚持战斗。他们满怀信心地迎接从德国、从摩拉维亚高原地带打过来的苏联红军。
    参加布拉格武装起义的是在捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导下的工人、市民、警察、青年和家庭妇女。影片对这些人物的刻划，是素描式的，但每个人都显得那么真实，生动，给人们以深刻的印象。我们看老工人侯晒克吧，党要他负责防守特罗亚大桥，他就带领着大家，整日整夜地监视着敌人，风里雨里，不松一口气。他懂得保卫这座桥的意义，他发动大家筑了四道工事，要使每一道工事都成为纳粹匪徒们的墓地。他两次打消了两个青年人关于炸断大桥以阻挡敌人的建议，他说：“桥是咱们的。……要是咱们自己人从北边来了怎么办？……你还不知道，咱们在等着谁吗？”到最后的阵地都发生了困难，剩下不到十颗子弹的时候，侯晒克的胜利的信心依然没有动摇：“咱们完了，可是布拉格不会完。在布拉格我们还有两千多个工事哪。”在这个老工人身上，表现了一个共产党人在那样紧急关头对党、对革命事业的无限忠诚。影片也真实动人地描写了这位老工人的真挚的感情。年青的中士向他辞别走向第一道工事去的时候，侯晒克忽然问：“我说，中士，你结过婚没有？”这一句话表现了多么深切的爱，多么沉重的心情！他爱自己的儿子贝皮克，不让他去冒着枪炮的危险，而当儿子偷偷地出去当了反坦克手，并且勇敢地打中了敌人的坦克的时候，做父亲的是又气愤又高兴的。最后，贝皮克受了伤，讷讷地说：“爸爸，你，你别骂我！”侯晒克只是平静地点点头。这个英雄人物的工人阶级战士的感情和父亲的感情，充分地表现出来了。
    年青的波兰女战士哈琳娜的形象，也是很突出的。影片描写这个人物的手法，是巧妙的。她走下被救出的囚车时，第一句话就是“给我一枝枪！”透过那一双炯炯发光的眼睛，人们可以看到一股强烈的复仇的火焰。捷克斯洛伐克不是她的祖国，在布拉格她不认识一个人，可是她还是毫无畏缩地走上战斗的岗位，守在特罗亚大桥上了。影片通过各种各样的镜头，突出地表现了她的英雄的性格。挺身隐蔽住年青的贝皮克不让敌人射击的时候，她显出了舍己救人的高贵品质；搜查潜伏的纳粹匪徒的时候，她显出了高度的机智；在大桥上的沉着和坚强，又显出了她的丰富的战斗经验；到最后，坚守在石匠作场荒地上的时候，她温柔地抚摸着身旁的一枝盛开的丁香花，微笑地说：“这儿有枝丁香花。”在这枝丁香花上，她看到和平的幸福的明天。有了这最后的描写，女战士哈琳娜的形象就使人不能忘怀了。
    影片里也描绘了更多的普通人的形象。那个久经锻炼的老共产党员克鲁巴，他是那样地冷静和沉着！他噙着眼泪对着苏军坦克上的红旗说：“过去为它受多少迫害！”那个年青的中士，自己的两条腿都给炸断了，还伸直臂膀叫：“快走，同志们，快上船！”他要哈琳娜留给他一颗手榴弹，和她吻别，然后安静地抽着最后一枝烟，拉开手榴弹的导火管，等着将冲上桥来的敌人。那个善良的母亲纳德维德太太，献出了自己的心爱的儿子，又献出了自己；她要为儿子报仇，也要为祖国报仇，还没来得及射出第二颗枪弹，就牺牲了。国旗盖着她，盖着一个母亲底崇高的灵魂。还有那个爱国的警察勃儒柴克，那个奋不顾身的矿工，那个热情的电车女售票员。……所有这些为共产党所教养和领导着的人民英雄们，都在战斗中各自表现了他们的性格，深深地感动了观众。
    影片生动地刻划人物性格的发展。在五天五夜的战斗中，这群普通人经历了烈火般的锻炼。最初，人们的想法还是天真的，当敌人还没有放下武器的时候，徒手的群众就高举着三色国旗在大街上喊
    “自由万岁”了，那个矿工还准备回家换新衣服去哩。然而，敌人的枪声响了，善良人们的鲜血照亮了他们的眼睛，连那个说别人不喊“万岁”就是不爱国的公务员也懂得去找军火了。他们明白了自由不会轻易得到的。战斗使人们坚强起来，使他们的思想认识提高。
    特罗亚大桥上的人们，和布拉格其他两千处工事上的人们一样，和全捷克斯洛伐克、全欧洲、全世界战斗着的人民一样，懂得自己为什么而战斗，为什么而牺牲。党在炮火声里，通过电台向人们说：“我们不仅是为自由而战，而且是为美好的明天，为我们下一代的自由而战！在我们流血里将成长起来一个新的国家，这个国家将是我们自己的，将由我们自己来管理。……”
    是的，影片“黎明前的战斗”告诉人们的，正是这个真理。（附图片）
    布拉格的战斗结束了，坚持着保卫特罗亚大桥的英雄们，迎接神勇的苏联红军的来到。老工人侯晒克紧紧拥抱住红军的坦克手，庆贺布拉格的解放
