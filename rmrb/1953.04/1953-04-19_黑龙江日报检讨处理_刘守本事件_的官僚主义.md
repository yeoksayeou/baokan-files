    Heilongjiang Daily's Self-Criticism on Bureaucracy in Handling the "Liu Shouben Incident"
    Letter from the Heilongjiang Daily Editorial Department: The People's Daily's newspaper work review on February 28th, "Open Fire on the Barbaric Acts of Suppressing Correspondents' Criticism," criticized our bureaucracy in handling the "Liu Shouben Incident." We believe this criticism is completely correct and very pertinent. The "Liu Shouben Incident" was delayed for one year and three months before we sent someone to investigate and handle it. From the investigation to the publication, it took nearly three months, totaling one and a half years. This shows that the bureaucracy within our editorial department has reached a very serious level. First of all, we did not feel strong indignation towards the repeated appeals from the active peasant correspondents Liu Shouben and Zhang Shoutian to the editorial department about the serious retaliation they suffered. We did not immediately fight against this barbaric act of suppressing criticism, but delayed it again and again, and only relied on the Zhaodong County Party Committee to help solve it. Secondly, when the Zhaodong County Party Committee did not seriously deal with this problem, and after we sent reporters to the scene to investigate and clarify the truth, we did not promptly make a public exposure and criticize the Zhaodong County Party Committee. Instead, we feared that the Zhaodong County Party Committee would "become passive" and waited for them to handle it with results before publishing it, which led to another delay of nearly three months. We made the same mistake in handling the "Shen Xiang Incident." This shows that our sense of responsibility for protecting our correspondents (especially worker-peasant correspondents) from persecution is extremely weak. After reviewing the "Liu Shouben Incident," we are now determined to follow the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, to bravely assume the responsibility of protecting correspondents and resolutely fight against the barbaric acts of suppressing correspondents' criticism.

    黑龙江日报检讨处理“刘守本事件”的官僚主义
    黑龙江日报编辑部来信：二月二十八日人民日报
    “向压制通讯员批评的野蛮行为开火”的报纸工作述评，批评了我们在处理“刘守本事件”中的官僚主义。我们认为这个批评是完全正确、十分中肯的。“刘守本事件”拖延了一年零三个月，我们才派人调查处理，从调查到发表又经过了将近三个月，前后达一年半之久，这说明我们编辑部的官僚主义已到了十分严重的程度。首先，我们对积极的农民通讯员刘守本、张守田几次向编辑部申诉他们遭受严重打击报复的情形，不感到强烈的愤恨，立即和这种压制批评的野蛮行为进行斗争，而是一拖再拖，并且仅仅依赖肇东县委，请他们帮助解决。其次，当肇东县委未认真处理这个问题，而我们派记者前往现地调查弄清事实真相后，我们又不及时进行公开揭发，并对肇东县委提出批评，而是怕肇东县委“被动”，等待他们处理有结果后再发表，以致又拖延了将近三个月时间。我们在处理“沈祥事件”中也有同样的错误。由此可见，我们对保护自己的通讯员（特别是工农通讯员）不受迫害的责任感极为薄弱。经过对“刘守本事件”的检查，今后我们决心按照中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定，在省委的领导下，勇敢地负起保护通讯员的责任，向压制通讯员批评的野蛮行为进行坚决的斗争。
