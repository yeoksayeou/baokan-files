    YU NAN Agricultural Implement Machinery Factory Discusses Plan to Seriously Promote Three-Section Furnace Iron Smelting Method
    The key production problem for the local state-owned YU NAN Agricultural Implement Machinery Factory in Xinyang Special District, Henan Province, was the poor iron smelting method. In the past, they used old-fashioned hand-operated furnaces, and workers could only smelt a maximum of 4,350 jin of iron per day, which couldn’t meet the demand. Furthermore, burn injuries were prone to occur. During the planning discussion this time, the factory leadership heard that the Xinyang Locomotive Depot of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration used a three-section furnace iron smelting method, which could increase production, reduce defective products, save coal, and ensure safe production. They decided to seriously study and promote this advanced experience.
    Initially, some workers had conservative ideas and were unwilling to learn with an open mind. The trade union invited Wang Futang, an advanced producer from the Xinyang Locomotive Depot, to the factory to report on his ideological struggles during the learning of advanced experience and his new production achievements after learning advanced experience. They also asked him to perform a practical demonstration. The demonstration resulted in a total of more than 4,100 jin of iron being smelted in three and a half hours, from 10:00 AM to 1:30 PM. The coal-iron ratio improved from smelting a little over three jin of iron per jin of coal to smelting five jin of iron per jin of coal, and the defective product rate decreased from 12.4% to 2.5%, while also reducing labor intensity. After the demonstration, the factory held a meeting to examine and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the demonstration in a democratic manner, enabling employees to further recognize the characteristics of the three-section furnace iron smelting method. After this practical education, the workers happily said: The door to learning advanced experience has been opened. (Wang Tianzhong)

    豫南农具机械厂讨论计划中
    认真推广三节炉熔铁法
    河南省信阳专区地方国营豫南农具机械厂，生产上的关键问题是熔铁办法不好。过去熔铁用的是旧式手搬炉，工人每天最多才熔四千三百五十斤铁，供不上需要，同时容易发生烫伤事故。在这次讨论计划时，该厂领导上听说郑州铁路管理局信阳机务段用的是三节炉熔铁法，能提高产量、少出废品、节约煤炭和保证安全生产，就决定认真学习，推广这一先进经验。
    开始，部分工人有保守思想，不肯虚心学习，工会就邀请信阳机务段先进生产者汪福堂到厂报告他在学习先进经验中思想斗争的经过和学习先进经验后生产上的新成绩，并且请他做了实地表演。表演结果，从上午十点到下午一点半，三个半钟头内共熔铁四千一百多斤，炭铁比由每斤炭熔三斤多铁提高到熔五斤铁，废品率由百分之十二点四减少到百分之二点五，并减轻了劳动强度。表演结束后，该厂又召开会议，用民主方式检查、总结表演中的优缺点，使职工更加认清三节炉熔铁法的特点。经过这一次实际教育，工人们高兴地说：学习先进经验的大门打开了。                            （王天中）
