    Yang Qinglin Agricultural Production Cooperative Implements Steady Development Policy; Changes System of Livestock Stock Investment and Interest Payment to Livestock Rental by the Cooperative
    Not long ago, the Jiaohe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jilin Province sent a work team to Shengli Village, Renhe Township, Fourteenth District, to help the newly established Yang Qinglin Agricultural Production Cooperative resolve the issue of livestock valuation for stock investment. This cooperative has a total of fifteen households, and from February 15th to March 13th this year, they delivered a total of 800 cartloads of manure, prepared more than 5,000 bundles of firewood, and readied all the seeds, so that the spring plowing preparations are largely complete. This cooperative has begun to have a positive influence on the surrounding mutual aid teams and individual farmers. However, many problems still exist within the cooperative that urgently need to be resolved: (1) Livestock stock investment was too early and too rushed. All seven horses, three cows, one donkey, and four carts of the fifteen households were incorporated into the cooperative using the method of valuation for stock investment. Although this can resolve the contradiction between individual feeding of livestock and collective use of livestock, it affected the emotions of horse-raising households. Before joining the cooperative, Cheng Kui sold one of his three horses because he feared livestock stock investment. After a member named Du Chunxi invested his favorite cow into the cooperative, he would always go to the cow trough to touch the cow after finishing work every day; later, the cooperative sold the cow to exchange for soybean cakes, and he was so sad that he didn't sleep all night, thinking, "It's all for nothing that I raised it, if I hadn't joined the cooperative, I wouldn't have sold the cow no matter how difficult it was!" (2) The interest on invested livestock was set too high. When the cooperative determined the interest on livestock, it blindly copied the livestock stock investment method of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative without considering the local customs and the specific situation of few sideline occupations, stipulating a three percent interest rate. However, the rental price of a livestock animal per year in the area does not exceed two dan of grain. If calculated at a three percent interest rate, a livestock animal could get five or six dan of grain, which also harmed the interests of households without livestock. (3) Labor discipline is lax, and some members do not care for the livestock. When members drive carts to deliver manure, they sit on the cart regardless of whether it is lightly or heavily loaded; when the livestock is heavily loaded uphill and cannot move, they beat them; they are also careless about feeding the livestock, sometimes not feeding them even once at night, and some livestock are gradually losing weight.
    In order to solve this problem, the work team repeatedly explained the policies to the members, publicized the principle of developing cooperatives steadily from small to large, and explained that the key to running a cooperative well is not to have a good appearance in form, but to produce more grain and increase the income of the members. At the same time, it pointed out that incorporating livestock into the cooperative too early through stock investment would inevitably cause many difficult problems. Seeing that the members understood this principle, the work team organized everyone to discuss remedial measures. Everyone agreed to change the method of livestock stock investment and interest payment to the method of renting livestock by the cooperative. According to local customs and the strength of the livestock, the price was negotiated in three grades. The cooperative is responsible for the livestock feed. In order to overcome the contradiction between individual ownership and collective use, the work team also helped the cooperative to set labor quotas for livestock and records of livestock use.
    After this change, livestock-owning households said, "This change is really good, whose livestock still belongs to whom. Let's work hard, earn more work points, and buy another one in the autumn." (Wang Engui)

    杨青林农业生产合作社贯彻稳步发展方针
    把车马入股行息办法改为由社租用牲畜制
    不久以前，中共吉林省蛟河县委会派工作组到十四区仁和村胜利屯，帮助今年新建立的杨青林农业生产合作社解决了车马作价入股的问题。这个合作社共有十五户，从今年二月十五日到三月十三日，共送了八百车粪，准备了五千多捆烧柴，备齐了全部籽种，春耕准备工作已大体就绪。这个合作社已开始对周围互助组和个体农民发生了良好的影响。可是，社内也还存在着许多急待解决的问题：（一）车马入社过早过急。十五户社员的七匹马、三头牛、一头驴、四台车全部采取作价入股的办法入了社。这样做，虽然能解决个人喂养牲畜与集体使用牲畜的矛盾，但却影响了养马户的情绪。程魁在入社前害怕车马入股，就把自己的三匹马卖掉了一匹。社员杜春秀把自己最爱的一头牛入了股，每天干完了活，总要先到牛槽摸摸这头牛；后来合作社把这头牛卖掉换了豆饼，他难过得一宿没睡觉，心想：“白饲养喽，要不入社，怎么困难也不能卖牛！”（二）入股牲口的利息订高了。该社确定牲畜利息的时候，不考虑当地习惯和副业少的具体情况，盲目搬用韩恩农业生产合作社牲畜入股的办法，规定三分利息。可是当地每年一头牲畜的租价不超过两石粮食，若按三分行息，一头牲口能得五、六石粮食，这样也损害了无马户的利益。（三）劳动纪律松懈，有些社员不爱护牲畜。社员赶车送粪时，不论是轻车重车，都要坐在车上；牲口重载上坡，走不动就打；对牲口喂养也不经心，有时夜里一次也不喂，有的牲畜逐渐掉膘了。
    工作组为了解决这个问题，便对社员们反复交代政策，宣传由小到大、稳步发展合作社的方针，说明办好合作社的关键不在乎形式上好看，而在于多打粮食、增加社员收入。同时指出：过早地用入股的办法使社员把车马入社，必然会引起很多难于解决的问题。工作组看到社员们想通了这个道理，就组织大家讨论补救的办法。大家都同意把车马入股行息的办法，改为由社租用牲畜的办法。按照当地习惯和牲畜体力强弱，分成三等议价。牲畜草料由合作社负责。为了克服个人占有和集体使用的矛盾，工作组又帮助该社定出牲畜的劳动定额和使用牲畜的纪录。
    这样改变以后，有马户说：“这一改，谁的牲畜还归谁，真好。好好干活吧，多挣劳动日到秋天再买一头。”（王恩贵）
