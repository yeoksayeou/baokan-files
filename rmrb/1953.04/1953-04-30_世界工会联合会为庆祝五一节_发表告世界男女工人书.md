Xinhua News Agency Report from Vienna:

    The World Federation of Trade Unions, in celebration of May Day 1953, issued a letter to the working men and women of the world. The full text is as follows: Dear Brothers and Sisters!
    May Day is an international day of commemoration of the unity, struggle, and demonstration of solidarity of the working class for workers all over the world. It is a great festival for workers.
    The WFTU extends warm and fraternal greetings to you in celebration of May Day 1953.
    The current international situation requires all workers to unite their ranks more closely, so that the masses of people can raise their voices louder this May Day, demanding peace—the common interest of all peoples of the world.
    In the past year, the suppression of workers' organizations in capitalist, semi-colonial, and colonial countries has become even more rampant. The headquarters of workers' organizations have been searched by the police, workers' democratic and trade union rights have been further attacked, and militant members of the workers' movement have been arrested and imprisoned. These governments have adopted fascist measures against workers, undermining the laws they themselves have made.
    This May Day, we pay tribute to all workers, to our brothers who are suffering under capitalist repression.
    The broad masses of workers around the world are increasingly resisting the forces of war and the attacks of reactionaries.
    May Day demonstrations held in every capitalist, semi-colonial, and colonial country will give greater initiative to the workers' struggle to meet pressing economic and social demands.
    These demonstrations will make the working people more determined to act to defend their threatened democratic freedoms and national independence, and to win the democratic freedoms and national independence they have not yet gained.
    In this way, the bulwark built by the people of all countries against the threat of world war, against colonial repression, and against all forms of reactionary and poverty-stricken policies will be further consolidated.
    The greedy monopolists, desperately pursuing maximum profits, are determined to intensify the exploitation of workers. This ambition will inevitably be defeated by the powerful united front of the masses of people of all countries.
    The WFTU calls on working men and women all over the world to actively prepare for and participate in the celebration of May Day.
    Let us demonstrate the invincible nature of the workers' united front this May Day.
    May the workers' struggle to increase wages, oppose unemployment, and defend trade union rights develop into an irresistible mass movement.
    Provide new impetus to the struggle to defend peace, and let every trade union organization make its utmost effort to ensure that the masses take on this great cause of peace and defend it to the end.
    It is hoped that the WFTU's greetings to workers around the world and our slogans in celebration of May Day 1953 will make the international workers' movement, united under the glorious banner of proletarian internationalism, more powerful, more vigilant, and more militant.
    We wholeheartedly salute the workers in capitalist, semi-colonial, and colonial countries, whose struggle against the evil conspiracies of imperialism is strengthening the camp of peace and democracy.
    We salute with enthusiasm our brothers and sisters in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries, whose creative work and active participation in the international workers' movement are daily consolidating the world front of peace supporters and strengthening the friendship of the people of all countries. The great achievements of the workers in these countries fill the workers in capitalist, semi-colonial, and colonial countries with enthusiasm, make them realize their strength, and strengthen their confidence in the final victory over the exploiters. Working men and women:
    This May Day, let us consolidate the unity of the working class ranks and create favorable conditions for achieving unity of action in factories.
    Let us overcome division. Let us ruthlessly expose all those who conspire to undermine unity. This unity is especially indispensable to workers today.
    Workers' unity of action is the permanent goal of all supporters of the WFTU.
    Achieving this unity is our most important and decisive task. Every worker, every fighter, and every trade union must complete this task with ardent determination and resolute will.
    Unite and take joint action in your factories and any place of work.
    Advance towards the goal of strengthening unity of action.
    Advance towards new victories in the struggle against the exploiters and against the splitters of the working class.
    Advance towards the goal of strengthening the solidarity of the international working class movement and the friendship of workers of all countries around the world.
    Let us fight together to free the arrested workers—those persecuted by the reactionaries.
    Long live the great and noble cause of peace!
    Long live the unity of the working masses in the decisive struggle for freedom, national independence, and a bright future!
    Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions—the fighting unity organization of workers all over the world!
    Long live May Day 1953!

    世界工会联合会为庆祝五一节
    发表告世界男女工人书
    【新华社讯】维也纳消息：世界工会联合会为庆祝一九五三年“五一”节发表告世界男女工人书，全文如下：亲爱的兄弟姐妹们！
    “五一”节是全世界各地工人的团结、斗争和表现工人阶级的精诚一致的国际纪念日。这是工人的伟大的节日。
    世界工联为庆祝一九五三年“五一”节向你们表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    当前国际形势要求全体工人更紧密地团结他们的队伍，使人民群众在今年“五一”节更大声地发出要求和平——全世界各国人民的共同利益——的呼声。
    在过去一年中，在资本主义、半殖民地和殖民地国家中对工人组织的镇压更加猖狂了。工人组织的总部遭到警察的搜查、工人的民主权利和工会权利遭到进一步进攻、工人运动的战斗成员被逮捕下狱。这些政府对工人采取法西斯措施，破坏了它们自己制订的法律。
    在今年“五一”节，我们向全体工人，向我们遭受着资本主义镇压的弟兄致敬。
    世界各地的广大工人群众正在声势日益壮大地抵抗战争的势力和反动派的进攻。
    每一个资本主义、半殖民地和殖民地国家里面举行的“五一”示威游行，将使工人争取满足迫切的经济和社会要求的斗争带有更大的主动性。
    这种示威游行将使劳动人民更加坚决地行动起来，保卫他们受到威胁的民主自由和民族独立，赢得他们尚未获得的民主自由和民族独立。
    这样，各国人民为了反对世界大战的威胁、反对殖民镇压以及各种形式的反动及贫困政策而建立的壁垒就更加巩固了。
    贪得无厌、拚命追求最大利润的垄断资本家，一心想要加紧对工人的剥削。这种野心必将被各国人民群众的强大的联合阵线所击败。
    世界工联号召全世界的男女工人积极筹备并参加庆祝“五一”节。
    让我们在“五一”节把工人联合阵线的不可战胜的性质表现出来。
    祝工人争取提高工资、反对失业、保卫工会权利的斗争，发展成为不可抗拒的群众运动。
    为保卫和平的斗争提供新的动力，让每个工会组织尽最大的努力，使群众把这个伟大的和平事业担当起来并把它保卫到底。
    希望世界工联为庆祝一九五三年“五一”节对全世界工人的祝贺以及我们的口号，能使团结在工人阶级国际主义的光辉旗帜下的国际工人阶级运动更加有力量，更加有警惕性，更加有战斗性。
    我们衷心向资本主义、半殖民地和殖民地国家的工人致敬，他们反对帝国主义罪恶阴谋的斗争，正在加强着和平民主阵营。
    我们满怀热情地向我们在苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的兄弟姐妹致敬。他们的创造性的工作和他们积极参加国际工人运动的行动，每天都在巩固着和平拥护者的世界战线，都在加强着各国人民的友谊。这些国家的工人的伟大成就，使资本主义、半殖民地和殖民地国家的工人充满热情，使他们认识到自己的力量，并加强了他们对战胜剥削者的最后胜利的信心。劳动男女们：
    在今年“五一”节，让我们来巩固工人阶级队伍的团结，并创造有利条件以达到工厂中的行动一致。
    让我们来克服分裂。让我们来无情地揭露所有阴谋破坏团结的人。这种团结对工人来说，在今天尤其是不可缺少的。
    工人的行动一致是世界工联的所有拥护者的永久目标。
    取得这种团结是我们的最重要的、有决定意义的任务。每一个工人、每一个战斗者和每一个工会必须以热烈的决心和坚决的意志来完成这个任务。
    团结起来，在你们的工厂和任何工作地点采取共同行动。
    向加强行动一致的目标前进。
    向反对剥削者和反对工人阶级分裂者的斗争的新胜利前进。
    向加强国际工人阶级运动的精诚团结和全世界各国工人的友谊的目标前进。
    让我们来共同斗争，争取释放被捕工人——受反动派迫害的人。
    伟大而崇高的和平事业万岁！
    工人群众在争取自由、民族独立和美好将来的决定性的斗争中的团结万岁！
    世界工会联合会——全世界工人的战斗的团结组织万岁！
    一九五三年“五一”节万岁！
