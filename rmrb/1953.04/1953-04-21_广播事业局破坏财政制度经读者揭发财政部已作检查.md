    Radio Bureau Sabotages Financial System; Reader's Revelation Leads to Ministry of Finance Inspection
    Editor's Note: In late December of last year, Comrade Lin Faxian of the Procurement Section of the Equipment Department of the Radio Bureau under the Government Administration Council's Culture and Education Committee wrote a letter exposing the Radio Bureau's acts of sabotaging the financial system. After our newspaper forwarded this letter to the Central Ministry of Finance, the Finance Supervision Department of the Ministry of Finance conducted an inspection based on this clue. The results proved that the situation revealed by Comrade Lin Faxian was true. On April 3rd, the Ministry of Finance informed us of the problems found during the inspection and their opinions. Mass supervision is an important condition for ensuring the effective implementation of the national financial system. Comrade Lin Faxian's letter illustrates this point. We now publish an abstract of Comrade Lin Faxian's letter from late December of last year and the Central Ministry of Finance's letter of reply from April 3rd.
    Comrade Lin Faxian's letter from late December of last year
    Lin Faxian of the Procurement Section of the Equipment Department of the Radio Bureau writes: The end of the year is approaching, and all units are doing accounting cleanup work. I have found that some units are trying every means to spend the remaining funds in order to use up this year's expenses, rushing to buy things. Take our Radio Bureau's Equipment Department as an example. Recently, leading comrades have been urging us to buy this and that. Some things cannot be bought now, but the leading comrades want us to place orders, saying that the other party must collect the deposit this year, otherwise, we won't order. I think this is very wrong and have raised my opinions to the leading comrades. The leading comrades said: Although we went through the "Three-Anti" movement, at the end of the year, everyone wants to use the remaining money to buy some things. I am telling you this situation, hoping that you will correct this behavior that violates the financial system.
　　Central Ministry of Finance's reply letter from April 3rd
    The Central People's Government Ministry of Finance writes: We are now informing you of the problems found by the Finance Supervision Department of this ministry during its inspection of the Central Radio Bureau and our handling opinions.
    At the end of 1952, the Central Radio Bureau arbitrarily withdrew 600 million yuan from the income from the transfer of equipment over the years (this amount should be turned over) to pre-purchase unnecessary equipment. Except for ordering 1,000 glass pagoda insulators, using 75 million yuan; the remaining more than 500 million yuan was not spent. After this inspection, it was handed over. Another 300 million yuan was found, and the bureau's accountant said it was a missed entry. From November 25th last year to early January this year, the bureau spent a total of more than 68 million yuan from the surplus of office expenses to purchase 903 Golden Star fountain pens, distributing one to each cadre. The above are all serious acts of sabotaging the national financial system.
    In addition, the bureau has a large backlog of inventory equipment, and the accounts are chaotic; cement and steel have been wasted due to the backlog. These all show that the bureau has poor management of state property, and the leadership has not paid enough attention to financial work. Therefore, we put forward the following handling opinions:
    1.  The 600 million yuan proposed at the end of the year, in addition to the more than 500 million yuan not used and the more than 300 million yuan of missed accounts that have been handed over after inspection, the prepayment of 75 million yuan should be recovered and handed over in full.
    2.  Quickly and thoroughly clean up the inventory equipment and submit a report (distinguishing between usable and unnecessary items, and indicating disposal opinions), and send a copy of the report to this ministry.
    3.  The relevant personnel who violated financial discipline should be given appropriate criticism, and combined with the facts of this inspection, cadres should be educated to strictly abide by the national financial system and establish necessary systems to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future.
    Our ministry has submitted the above opinions to the Government Administration Council's Culture and Education Committee and the Radio Bureau.

### 广播事业局破坏财政制度经读者揭发财政部已作检查

专栏：读者来信摘要

    广播事业局破坏财政制度经读者揭发财政部已作检查
    编者按：去年十二月底，政务院文教委员会广播事业局器材处采购科蔺法先同志来信，揭发广播事业局有破坏财政制度的行为。经本报把这封信转给中央财政部后，财政部财政监察司就根据这个线索进行检查，结果证明了蔺法先同志揭发的情况是真实的。四月三日，财政部已把检查出的问题和他们的意见告诉我们。群众性的监督是保证国家财政制度切实执行的一个重要条件，蔺法先同志的来信正说明这一点。现在我们把蔺法先同志去年十二月底的来信和中央财政部四月三日的来信摘要发表于后。
    蔺法先同志去年十二月底的来信
    广播事业局器材处采购科蔺法先来信：年关即将到来，各机关都在做账目清理工作。我发现有些机关为了用完本年度的经费，就想一切办法来把余款用掉，抢购东西。就拿我们广播事业局器材处来说，最近领导同志直催我们买这买那。有的东西现在买不到，领导同志要我们去订购，并说对方必须今年先收订款，否则就不订。我认为这样做很不对，曾向领导同志提出意见。领导同志说：虽然经过“三反”运动，但到年底谁也想把剩下的钱买些东西用掉。我把这个情况告诉你们，希望你们纠正这种违反财政制度的行为。
　　中央财政部四月三日的答复信
    中央人民政府财政部来信：现将本部财政监察司检查中央广播事业局所发现的问题和我们的处理意见告诉你们。
    中央广播事业局在一九五二年底擅自将历年转让器材收入中（此款应上缴）提出六亿元预购不必需的器材。除已订玻璃宝塔绝缘子一千个，用款七千五百万元外；余款五亿余元未用出，经此次检查后上缴；还有三亿元经查出后，该局会计说是漏了账。去年十一月二十五日至今年一月初，该局共支用办公费结余六千八百多万元，购买金星水笔九百零三支分给干部每人一支。以上都是严重破坏国家财政制度的行为。
    此外，该局库存器材积压很多，账目混乱；洋灰、钢筋已因积压造成浪费。这些都说明该局对国家财产管理不善，领导上对财务工作还没有引起足够的重视。因此，我们提出如下处理意见：
    一、年终提出的六亿元，除未用完的五亿余元及漏账的三亿余元检查后已上缴外，其预付定金七千五百万元应悉数收回上缴。
    二、迅速彻底清理库存器材，并造表上报（分清能用的与不需用的，并注明处理意见），报表抄送本部一份。
    三、对上述违犯财政纪律的有关人员应给予适当批评，并结合此次检查的事实，对干部进行严格遵守国家财政制度的教育，建立必要制度，以防止今后类似情形发生。
    以上意见我部已向政务院文教委员会和广播事业局提出。
