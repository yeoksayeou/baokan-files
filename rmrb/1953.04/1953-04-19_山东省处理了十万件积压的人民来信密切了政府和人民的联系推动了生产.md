Shandong Province's work in handling people's letters and receiving people was gradually emphasized and strengthened under the guidance of the Central Committee and the East China Bureau. In October of last year, the Shandong Sub-bureau and the Shandong Provincial People's Government issued instructions to inspect the handling of people's letters. Party committees and governments at and above the county level, based on the spirit of the instructions, inspected past work, formulated plans for inspecting and handling people's letters, assigned cadres for key inspections, and vigorously handled typical cases. Since January of this year, when the Central Committee issued instructions to launch a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, various localities have further emphasized the work of handling people's letters and receiving people, and have actively launched the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, starting with handling people's letters. The accumulated letters from the past were sorted, prioritized, and handled using various methods according to their nature and urgency. Leading organs at and above the county level continued to vigorously handle a number of typical cases. The Shandong Sub-bureau and the Provincial People's Government sent eleven inspection teams to eleven special districts to inspect and supervise, and to assist in investigating major cases, further promoting the handling of people's letters and the development of the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. As of the end of February this year, most of the approximately 100,000 accumulated people's letters in various organs throughout the province had been processed.

Among the people's letters in various localities, letters directly reflecting the violations of law and discipline by grassroots cadres and the poor work style of cadres at all levels generally accounted for about 40%. For example, in the 3,121 letters in the Jiao County Special District, letters exposing the poor work style and violations of law and discipline by cadres accounted for 50%; in the 4,702 letters in the Wendeng Special District, complaints against grassroots cadres for violating law and discipline accounted for 31%. These letters revealed many shocking illegal incidents, and also exposed the serious bureaucratic work style of leading organs not understanding the situation below, not caring about the suffering of the masses, and some leading cadres condoning and tolerating bad people and bad deeds, making leading cadres at all levels feel the seriousness of the problem and strengthening their determination to fight against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline.

By handling people's letters, bad people and bad deeds were opposed, Party and government organizations were purified, cadres were educated, the masses were mobilized, and various tasks were powerfully promoted. For example, Yuan Kemao, the head of Yuligou Township in Wulian County, was guilty of atrocious crimes such as beating the masses, raping women, extortion, and retaliatory persecution, forcing farmers Yuan Dexiang and his wife to death, which was deeply hated by the farmers in the entire township. When the county handled this case, it first combined it with the current production work for investigation, explained the policies, clarified the facts, and then convened a mass meeting of more than 1,000 people, punished Yuan Kemao according to law, and removed three bad cadres who were accessories. The county party committee and the county people's government profoundly reviewed their bureaucratic work style of not understanding the situation below and listening to only one side of the story, and the relevant departments also voluntarily reviewed and resolved to change their work style. After such handling, the masses in the township were overjoyed and shouted, "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" calling it "the second liberation." The number of mutual aid production teams increased from three to seven, township cadres were democratically elected, the number of youth league members increased, the militia was expanded, and all kinds of work became active, and the entire township took on a new look. In the third district of Zhangqiu County, five bad cadres, including Zhang Yuanshan and Bai Qishun, who violated law and discipline, were dealt with at a meeting of village cadres. Immediately, more than a dozen village cadres reviewed their commandist errors and some illegal and disciplinary actions. After the meeting, most village cadres voluntarily reviewed, and the masses were very moved. The relationship between cadres and the masses was improved, greatly promoting various tasks. Huang County handled Yu Qian, a lawless element in Sanjia Yujia Township; Bin County handled Zhao Yingxian, a bad element in Wang Hanlin Village; and Lijin County handled Shang Xinmin, a bad element in Shangquanzhuang Village. Many typical examples have achieved the same effect. In this way, on the one hand, the masses were mobilized, and many cadres who had committed general bureaucracy and commandism were educated and transformed. On the other hand, a small number of bad elements mixed into the Party and government organizations were discovered and eliminated (such as counter-revolutionaries, class dissidents, and degenerated elements), making the revolutionary organization more pure.

Through handling people's letters, the demands of the masses were met, the political enthusiasm of the masses was greatly enhanced, the ties between the Party and the People's Government and the masses were closer, and the number of people's letters and visits also greatly increased. The Shandong Sub-bureau received 40 to 50 people's letters every month last year; this increased to more than 120 letters in January and February of this year, and more than 70 letters in the first week of March. Zhucheng County received several hundred people's letters every month last year, and this increased to more than 1,100 letters every month this year. Yangxin County immediately received more than 50 accusatory letters after handling Yang Liren, a bad element in Dashi Yang Village. In Wulian County, after handling the illegal and disciplinary actions of Yuan Kemao at the county people's congress, the representatives also put forward more than 300 proposals on the issue of cadre work style. At the same time, the problems revealed in the people's letters became more extensive and profound. Liu Geng Village in Boxing County was always considered a "first-class village" by the district, but it was found from handling people's letters that the village party secretary was a bully who acted wildly and raped eleven women. In Guangrao Fourth District, the distribution of relief grain was unfair, and the masses immediately raised their opinions. The cadres did not accept them, and the masses repeatedly raised their opinions, finally leading to a correct solution to the problem.

The above achievements in the inspection and handling of people's letters are due to the fact that leading organs at all levels in Shandong Province have grasped the following main links:

(1) A comprehensive investigation, case ranking, distinguishing between importance and urgency, and adopting various methods for handling. Major cases are personally grasped by responsible cadres, who organize forces to investigate and handle them in a "one-rod-to-the-bottom" manner. General problems are handled through various people's representative conferences, various business departments, and in combination with party rectification, democratic governance, production, and other tasks. For example, Zhucheng County received a total of 5,256 people's letters from October last year to mid-February this year (including more than 1,000 accumulated letters from the past), and 4,544 cases have been processed and closed, accounting for more than 86% of the total. Among them, 59 major cases were investigated and handled as special cases, 1,650 cases were handled through people's representative conferences at all levels, 1,551 cases were handled by lower-level organizations and various business departments, 26 cases were handled in conjunction with party rectification, 1,125 cases were mediated by the government, and 133 cases were handled in other ways. In this way, although the number of people's letters in the county has increased greatly, they have generally been handled in a timely and proper manner.

(2) Select important cases, focus on inspection and handling, and publicize them widely to educate cadres and mobilize the masses. The Shandong Sub-bureau and the Provincial People's Government have successively handled major cases such as the Qianyang Village incident, the Han Sheng incident, the Cangshan cotton picking incident, and the Zhao Wangtang Village incident, and have continuously reported them in the Jinan Dazhong Daily, and published reviews by relevant leading cadres, which has played a huge role in promoting and guiding the handling of people's letters and the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. Various special districts, cities, and counties have handled a number of typical cases, which have also played a certain role in promoting and guiding the work.

(3) Combine the handling of people's letters with central tasks and various tasks to make it a driving force for promoting work. The handling of typical cases of violations of law and discipline in various localities is generally carried out by promoting the current central task, conducting in-depth investigations and research, mobilizing the masses, and handling the cases. In the handling process, policies are correctly reflected, bad elements who violate law and discipline are given due punishment, and cadres who have committed general bureaucracy and commandism are ordered to review and change their work style. In this way, cadres have a further understanding of the policies, and the awareness of cadres and the masses is improved. Then, on this basis, the organization is appropriately rectified, the leadership is improved, unity is strengthened, and central tasks and various tasks are further implemented. Cases handled in this way have achieved excellent results. Not only are the cases handled steadily and thoroughly, but also the masses are mobilized, cadres are educated and improved, and various tasks are driven, making many villages with backward work become villages with active work. The experience of Wulian County in handling Yuan Kemao, a lawless element in Yuligou Township, and Laixi County in handling Yu Xiangong and Yu Xianjing, counter-revolutionaries in Xialiulianzhuang Village, fully proves this point.

The largest number of people's letters are general criticisms and suggestions. Cherishing the opinions of the masses, closely combining them with various tasks, and seriously handling them also has a huge effect on overcoming shortcomings and errors in work and improving work. For example, the Qingdao Municipal People's Court inspected and corrected several cases of wrong judgments, such as the "Guomian Printing and Dyeing Factory's Na Fengqi case," based on people's letters. 90% of the people's letters received by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce helped to improve the work. 50% of the people's letters received by the Post and Telecommunications Bureau criticized errors in the work, which enabled them to be corrected in a timely manner.

Although Shandong Province has achieved the above achievements in handling people's letters, there are still many problems that must be further resolved. The main ones are:

(1) Some leading cadres (especially some leading cadres of counties and enterprises) still have insufficient understanding and attention to the work of handling people's letters, and they do not grasp it tightly, so the progress of the work is slow and weak. Many of the accumulated people's letters in the past have not been processed, and some cadres still take a laissez-faire and indulgent attitude towards bad people and bad deeds. It is necessary to further conduct in-depth inspections and corrections.

(2) The education of cadres is still not in-depth enough. The idea that district and township cadres do not pay attention to people's letters and think that handling people's letters is "too troublesome" and "affects the central task" is still relatively common. Therefore, district-level organs still have many accumulated people's letters. According to the inspection of the Huimin Prefectural Committee in January this year, the district-level Party and government organs in the entire district still had more than 2,000 accumulated people's letters. What is even more noteworthy is that there are still phenomena of village cadres retaliating against critics.

(3) Many areas have not fully utilized the power of organizations at all levels, closely combined the handling of people's letters with central tasks and various tasks, and adopted various methods for handling them. Therefore, the handling is slow, or they act blindly, listen to only one side of the story, and cause errors. In addition, the working system of some organs for handling people's letters is not sound enough, and there is a lack of necessary contact and coordination between departments, which also makes the work fall into chaos and passivity, affecting the improvement of work efficiency.

In order to overcome the above shortcomings, Party committees and People's Governments at all levels must continue to strengthen leadership, make good use of past experience, closely combine it with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, violations of law and discipline, and various tasks, and further strengthen the work of handling people's letters and receiving people's visits.

    山东省处理了十万件积压的人民来信密切了政府和人民的联系推动了生产
    山东省处理人民来信和接见人民群众的工作，是在中央、华东局的指示下逐步重视和加强起来的。去年十月，山东分局、山东省人民政府先后发出检查处理人民来信的指示，县以上各级党委和政府均根据指示精神，检查了过去的工作，作出了检查处理人民来信的计划，抽调干部进行了重点检查，并抓住典型案件，大张旗鼓地进行了处理。今年一月中央指示开展反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争以来，各地进一步重视了处理人民来信和接见人民群众的工作，并从处理人民来信入手，积极开展了反官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争。对过去积压的信件，经过案件排队，分清主次缓急，有计划地采用各种方法，分别进行了处理。县以上各级领导机关继续大张旗鼓地处理了一些典型案件，山东分局和省人民政府并派出十一个检查组，分赴十一个专区进行检查督促，并协助查办重大案件，进一步推动了处理人民来信工作，推动了反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪斗争的开展。截至今年二月底止，全省过去各级机关积压的约有十万件左右的人民来信，已大部作了处理。
    在各地人民来信中，直接反映基层干部违法乱纪及各级干部不良作风的信件，一般占百分之四十左右。如胶州专区三千一百二十一件来信中，属于揭发干部的不良作风及违法乱纪的信件占百分之五十；文登专区四千七百零二件来信中，控告基层干部违法乱纪者占百分之三十一。这些信件揭发出许多骇人听闻的违法事件，同时也揭露出领导机关不了解下情，不关心群众疾苦以及某些领导干部对坏人坏事姑息、纵容等严重的官僚主义作风，使各级领导干部感到问题严重，坚定了反对官僚主义、命令主义与违法乱纪斗争的决心。
    通过处理人民来信，反对了坏人坏事，纯洁了党政组织，教育了干部，发动了群众，有力地推动了各项工作。如五莲县于里沟乡乡长苑克茂吊打群众，奸淫妇女，敲诈勒索，挟嫌报复逼死农民苑德祥夫妇，罪行昭彰，全乡农民十分痛恨。该县在处理此案时，首先结合推动当前生产工作进行调查，讲明了政策，弄清了案情，然后召开了千余人的群众大会，法办了苑克茂，撤换了三个胁从的坏干部；县委、县人民政府深刻检讨了不了解下情、偏听偏信的官僚主义作风，有关部门也自动作了检讨并决心转变作风。经过这样处理后，该乡群众莫不欢欣鼓舞，高呼：“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”称为“二次解放”，生产互助组由三个发展到七个，民主选举了乡干部，发展了青年团员，扩大了民兵，各种工作都活跃起来，全乡面貌一新。章邱县三区在乡村干部会议上处理了张元善、柏其顺等五个违法乱纪的坏干部，当即有十几个乡村干部检讨了自己的命令主义错误和某些违法乱纪行为；会后大部分乡村干部均自动检讨，群众很受感动，干部和群众的关系得到了改善，大大推动了各项工作。黄县处理三甲于家乡违法乱纪分子于谦；滨县处理王翰林村坏分子赵英贤；利津县处理尚泉庄坏分子尚新民等许多典型事例，都收到了同样的效果。这样，一方面，发动了群众，教育改造了许多犯有一般官僚主义与命令主义的干部；另一方面，发现与清除了混在党政组织中的少数的坏分子
    （如混入的反革命分子、阶级异己分子及蜕化变质的分子等），使革命组织更加纯洁。
    通过处理人民来信，满足了群众的要求，群众的政治热情大大提高，党和人民政府与群众的联系更加密切，人民来信来访也随着大大增加。山东分局去年每月收到人民来信四、五十件；今年一、二月增至一百二十多件，三月份第一周即收到七十多件；诸城县去年每月收到人民来信几百件，今年每月增至一千一百多件；阳信县在处理了大石阳村坏分子杨立人后，当即收到控告信五十多件；五莲县在县人民代表会上处理了苑克茂违法乱纪事件后，代表又提出有关干部作风问题的提案三百多件。同时，人民来信中所揭发的问题也更加广泛更加深刻了。博兴县刘耿村一向被该区认为是“头等村”，但从处理人民来信中查出该村支部书记却是一个横行霸道、奸污了十一个妇女的恶霸；广饶四区发救济粮不公平，群众立即提出意见，干部不接受，群众又再三提出意见，终于使问题得到了正确解决。
    检查处理人民来信工作所以取得上述成绩，是由于山东省各级领导机关，掌握了以下几个主要环节：
    （一）全面清查，案件排队，分别轻重缓急，分别采取各种方法进行处理。其中重大案件，由负责干部亲身掌握，组织力量，采用“一竿子插到底”的办法，专案查办；一般问题则通过各级人民代表会议、各业务部门及结合整党、民主建政、生产等各种工作进行处理。如诸城县自去年十月至今年二月中旬共收到人民来信五千二百五十六件（过去积压的千余件在内），已处理结案者四千五百四十四件，占总数的百分之八十六强。其中专案查办的重大案件五十九件，通过各级人民代表会议处理的一千六百五十件，经下级组织及各业务部门处理的一千五百五十一件，结合整党处理的二十六件，政府调解的一千一百二十五件，其他一百三十三件。这样，该县人民来信虽然大量增加，但一般作到了及时与妥善的处理。
    （二）选择重要案件，重点检查处理，并大张旗鼓地宣传，以教育干部，发动群众。山东分局与省人民政府先后处理了前阳村事件、韩升事件、苍山拔棉事件、赵王堂村事件等重大案件，在济南大众日报上连续报道，并发表了有关领导干部的检讨，对推动与指导处理人民来信工作和反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争起了巨大的作用。各专区、市、县都处理了一批典型案件，也起了一定推动与指导的作用。
    （三）结合中心任务和各项工作处理人民来信，使其成为推动工作的动力。各地对违法乱纪典型案件的处理，一般是通过推动当前中心工作，深入调查研究，发动群众，进行处理。处理中正确体现政策，对违法乱纪的坏分子给予应得惩处，对犯有一般官僚主义和命令主义的干部，则责令进行检讨，转变作风。这样就使干部对政策有进一步的体会，提高了干部和群众的觉悟，然后在这个基础上，酌情整顿组织，健全领导，加强团结，进一步地贯彻中心任务和各项工作。凡是这样处理的案件，效果均极良好，不仅案件处理稳妥、透彻，而且发动了群众，教育提高了干部，带动了各项工作，使许多工作落后的村子，变为工作活跃的村子。五莲县处理于里沟乡违法乱纪分子苑克茂、莱西县处理下柳连庄反革命分子于显功、于显经等重大案件的经验，都充分证明了这点。
    人民来信中属于一般批评与建议的信件为数最多，珍惜群众的意见，紧密结合各项工作，认真加以处理，对于克服工作中的缺点、错误与改进工作，同样有巨大的作用。如青岛市人民法院根据人民来信检查纠正了“国棉印染厂那凤岐案”等数次错判案件；工商局接到的人民来信中有百分之九十帮助了工作的改进；邮电局接到的人民来信有百分之五十是批评工作中的差错，使之得以及时纠正。
    山东省处理人民来信工作虽已取得上述成绩，但目前仍存在许多问题，必须进一步加以解决。主要是：
    （一）某些领导干部（特别是某些县的和企业单位的领导干部）对处理人民来信工作仍认识不足，重视不够，抓的不紧，因而工作进展迟缓无力。过去积压的人民来信尚有不少未作处理，甚至有的干部仍对坏人坏事采取姑息、纵容的态度。必须进一步深入检查纠正。
    （二）对干部教育仍不够深入，区、乡干部不重视人民来信及认为处理人民来信“太麻烦”、“影响中心工作”的思想仍较普遍存在，因而区级机关至今积压的人民来信仍多。根据惠民地委今年一月份的检查，全区区级党政机关仍积压人民来信达二千件以上。更值得注意的是，目前还有乡村干部对批评者打击报复的现象。
    （三）不少地区尚未充分发挥各级各种组织的力量，紧密结合中心任务和各种工作，采用各种方法处理人民来信，因而处理迟缓，或者盲目行事，偏听偏信，造成错误。此外，有些机关处理人民来信的工作制度尚不够健全，各部门间工作上缺乏必要的联系与配合，也使工作陷于忙乱被动，影响工作效率的提高。
    为了克服以上这些缺点，各级党委和人民政府必须继续加强领导，很好地运用过去的经验，紧密结合反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争和各种工作，把处理人民来信和接见人民来访的工作进一步加强起来。
