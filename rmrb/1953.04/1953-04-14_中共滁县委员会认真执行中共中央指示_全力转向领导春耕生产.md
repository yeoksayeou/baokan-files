    The CPC Chuxian Committee Conscientiously Implements the CPC Central Committee's Instructions and Fully Shifts to Leading Spring Plowing Production

    The CPC Chuxian Committee of Anhui Province has conscientiously implemented the CPC Central Committee's instructions to Party committees at all levels regarding spring plowing production and has fully shifted to leading spring plowing production.

    In early March, districts and townships in Chuxian County had not yet paid enough attention to spring plowing production. The peasant masses requested cadres to help them formulate production plans, but the cadres ignored them. In late March, after studying the CPC Central Committee's instructions to Party committees at all levels regarding spring plowing production, the CPC Chuxian Committee immediately established a Rural Production Office, with County Party Secretary Li Dechong concurrently serving as director and County Farmers' Association Director Liu Yucheng concurrently serving as deputy director, to unifiedly lead the county's spring plowing production work. The CPC Chuxian Committee also immediately made reasonable work arrangements: halting the construction of highways; postponing the rectification of the Party, land survey for production determination, and typical experiment work on the people's representative election in the Wuyi and Shahe districts and Chengxi township; reducing the plan for eliminating illiteracy work in townships where it had already begun, carrying it out under the principle of not hindering spring plowing production; and closely integrating the movement to implement the Marriage Law, disaster area people's production for self-relief, and democratic reform of supply and marketing cooperatives with spring plowing production.

    Now, Chengxi Township, Chengxi Agricultural Production Cooperative, and Tang Shangyun Mutual Aid Team in Chuxian County, under the in-depth leadership of the CPC Chuxian Committee, have formulated annual production increase plans and launched a patriotic production increase competition to all townships, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and peasants in the county.

    中共滁县委员会认真执行中共中央指示
    全力转向领导春耕生产
    中共安徽省滁县委员会认真执行中共中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示，已全力转向领导春耕生产。
    三月上旬，滁县各区、乡对春耕生产还没有引起重视。农民群众要求干部帮助他们订生产计划，干部却不理睬。到三月下旬，中共滁县委员会在学习中共中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示后，立即成立农村生产办公室，以县委书记李德崇兼任主任，县农会主任刘玉成兼任副主任，统一领导全县春耕生产工作。中共滁县委员会并立即合理安排工作：停止修公路；乌衣、沙河两区的整党、查田定产和城西乡人民代表选举工作典型试验等工作推迟进行；扫除文盲工作已开始的乡，缩小计划，在不妨碍春耕生产的原则下进行；贯彻婚姻法运动、灾区人民生产自救和供销合作社民主改革等工作与春耕生产紧密结合进行。
    现在，滁县城西乡、城西农业生产合作社和唐尚云互助组在中共滁县委员会深入领导下，已订出全年增产计划，向全县各乡、各农业生产合作社、各互助组和全县农民发起开展爱国增产竞赛。（新华社）
