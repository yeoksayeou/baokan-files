    Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Project Starts This Year
    The construction work for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway this year has started on a large scale. Tens of thousands of workers who underwent winter training have entered the 100-kilometer construction site from Lanzhou to Yongdeng. The Lanzhou Engineering Section, with over 11,000 workers, is launching a labor competition to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day. They have basically completed 52 kilometers of roadbed engineering and overcome the obstacles of the marshy areas along the line, which are as deep as three meters. This has allowed the track laying on the west bank of the Yellow River to begin two days ahead of schedule. They plan to lay the tracks to the 69-kilometer mark by May 10th.
    This year, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is constructing the 184-kilometer line from Lanzhou to Wushaoling. Of this, 36 kilometers from Lanzhou to the Hekou Yellow River Bridge have already been laid with tracks. The section west of the Yellow River Bridge to Wushaoling is mountainous, and in many places, it is necessary to cut away mountain walls and fill deep valleys, making the project very arduous. In addition, during construction, it is also necessary to overcome engineering difficulties such as marshy areas and gravel collapses in some areas. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Opening Ceremony Held at Nanhu Construction Site
    The opening ceremony of the Nanhu construction site project of the First Engineering Team of the Nonferrous Metals Administration was solemnly held on April 15th. This is the earliest construction project to start in the new construction projects in Shenyang City.
    The First Engineering Team of the Nonferrous Metals Administration, which contracted the project, made full preparations before the start of construction, formulated a construction plan and construction organization design, and mobilized workers to formulate group plans. Therefore, cadres have a clear understanding, and workers are full of enthusiasm. At the opening ceremony, all workers pledged to complete the entire project in 108 days. These are projects that the puppet Manchukuo could not complete in three years. At the meeting, workers from sixteen groups submitted letters of guarantee, guaranteeing to meet the requirements of being good, fast, economical, and safe. Comrade Qi Tongyue, the leader of the advanced bricklaying group, stated that they were fully confident of completing the plan ahead of schedule.
    North China Geological Exploration Team Sets Off
    In early April, eleven geological exploration teams in North China set off for fieldwork. The exploration areas include the Yanshan area near the Bohai Sea, the foothills of the Daqing Mountains outside the Great Wall, the Lvliang Mountains on the east bank of the Yellow River, the Zhongtiao Mountain area at an elevation of 2,500 meters above sea level, the Fengfeng mining area, and the Taihang Mountains. The main task of this exploration is to find iron ore and manganese, quartz stone, dolomite, and other mineral raw materials for the further development of the iron and steel industry in North China. In addition, copper mines will also be explored. The task of the six general survey teams organized by the North China Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government is to conduct a general survey of areas where mineral occurrences have been discovered. The task of the two preliminary survey teams organized by the North China Geological Bureau and the three preliminary survey teams organized by the Industrial and Mining Research Institute of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government is to conduct preliminary surveys in the vast areas around the areas where the general survey teams are working, in conjunction with mass reporting of mineral deposits.

    Surveying Underground Resources in Shanxi Province
    All the geological staff of the Industrial and Mining Research Institute of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, after two months of intensive study, have now set off in four groups to explore the underground resources of the motherland in Xi County, Pu County, Changzhi, and Jincheng. In their studies, they criticized the idea held by some geologists that "Shanxi is a nest of mines and has no layered mines," and therefore has little mining value, and strengthened their confidence in their work. They also studied the Soviet experience in the classification and evaluation of various mineral reserves, the classification of ore deposits according to the difficulty of exploration, reserve calculation methods, observation points and observation routes, economic evaluation of mineral sites, sampling methods, implementation steps and key points of trenching, as well as a set of advanced geological survey work experience such as new specifications and quotas. In early March, they went to the East Mountain of Taiyuan, Jinci and other places for internships. Now, seven new technicians have initially become familiar with the general knowledge of geological survey work and have learned the methods of observing routes and observation points, filling in geological maps and profile maps. The old technicians have been able to initially master the new survey methods.
    Cooperation Between Both Parties Enables Early Commencement of Construction
    The first phase of the 101 construction site in Harbin commenced ahead of schedule. On April 7th, bricklayers had begun laying bricks, and carpenters had completed more than half of the finished door and window materials required for the project; rebar workers had also overfulfilled their plans. The important reason why the construction site was able to start early was the close cooperation between both parties, starting from the overall interests. For example, when Party B's temporary construction was not ready, Party A helped Party B solve the material problems and built 25 temporary construction buildings as workers' dormitories. Party A also lent all existing temporary construction to Party B for use, allowing a large number of workers to enter the construction site early. On the other hand, Party B actively and proactively grasped the preparatory work, and actively reflected difficulties to Party A, and Party A actively tried to solve them. For example, Party B initially lacked cadres, and Party A requested the higher authorities to allocate cadres. Party B also immediately raised opinions when they found shortcomings in Party A. For example, there were many errors in the design of the water tower, and the drawings did not indicate which side the windows should open to, and the cement did not indicate the specifications. Party B took the initiative to raise these issues with Party A, and they were quickly corrected. In addition, Party B also respected Party A's opinions very much, and when Party A pointed out shortcomings in the quality of the project, they were able to humbly accept them and immediately take effective measures to correct them. Both parties also established a joint conference system. At this conference, they discussed and resolved more than 30 issues related to project inspection, Party B's temporary construction, and wood drying.
    Lei Chengmo Successfully Creates Cladded-Wall Coking Oven
    Lei Chengmo, a worker at the washing and refining plant of the Chongqing State-owned 401 Coal Mine, successfully created a cladded-wall coking oven, which can increase production and save more than 800 million yuan for the country every year.
    Last October, the plant had more than 3,000 tons of metallurgical coke that was substandard and could not be sold. Lei Chengmo was very anxious when he saw this situation. After research, he came up with the idea of using a cladded-wall coking oven, which could both improve quality and shorten coking time, and the recovery rate would also be improved. After he put forward this suggestion, it was approved by the Party Committee and the administration, and the experiment was carried out immediately. As a result, the recovery rate reached 73.69% per ton, an increase of 8.69% compared to the old furnace; in terms of fuel, 93.81 kilograms per ton were saved compared to the old furnace; in terms of time, 3.205 hours per ton were saved compared to the old furnace. The annual increase in production and savings for the country can amount to more than 800 million yuan, and the time can also be saved by 267.8 days, and the quality has also been significantly improved.
    Inspired by Lei Chengmo's deeds, everyone has put forward rationalization proposals. Recently, the coal washing machine has been improved according to the proposals, and the daily coal washing has increased from 80 trucks to 130 trucks, and has even reached 150 trucks at its highest.
    Spring Arrives in the Himalayas
    When snowflakes are flying over the Tibetan Plateau and strong winds are still howling on the mountains, the valleys under the Himalayas are already warm and pleasant spring. Wildflowers bloom on the slopes, and mountain peach blossoms blush the spring water in the streams.
    The People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed on the border of the motherland and the local Tibetan people are tensely carrying out spring plowing and sowing. A unit of the People's Liberation Army has reclaimed more than 500 mu of barren land in three days. Under the influence of the soldiers' reclamation and production, the enthusiasm of the Tibetan people for production this year is even greater.
    The Tibetan people compare the arrival of the People's Liberation Army soldiers to the beginning of happiness. From the day the people's soldiers arrived at the border of the motherland, they have been helping the Tibetan people build a better home, helping them plow the land, chop firewood, carry water, and harvest grain, and also lend mules and horses to families without cattle. The Tibetan people also care for the soldiers like their own children. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    兰新铁路今年度工程开工
    兰新铁路今年度的修筑工程已大规模动工。几万个经过冬训的工人已进入兰州到永登的一百公里长的工地。兰州工程段一万一千多工人，正在开展劳动竞赛，迎接“五一”劳动节。他们已经基本上完成了五十二公里的路基工程，并克服了沿线深达三公尺的泛浆地带的阻碍，使黄河西岸的铺轨工程比原计划提前两天开始。他们准备争取在五月十日前把路轨铺到六十九公里处。
    兰新铁路今年修筑兰州至乌鞘岭一百八十四公里的一线，其中兰州至河口黄河大桥三十六公里已经铺好轨道。黄河大桥以西至乌鞘岭一段，山峦起伏，很多地方需要削去山壁，填平深谷，工程非常艰巨。此外，在修筑中，还必须克服有些地区泛浆及砂石坍方等工程上的困难。    （新华社）
    南湖工地举行开工典礼
    有色金属管理局第一工程队南湖工地工程，于四月十五日隆重举行开工典礼。这是沈阳市新建工程中开工最早的工程。
    承包该工程的有色金属管理局第一工程队，于开工前，进行了充分的准备，制订了施工计划和施工组织设计，并发动工人制订了小组计划。因此，干部心中有底，工人情绪饱满，在开工典礼大会上，全体工人提出一定保证以一百零八天的时间完成全部工程。这些工程是伪满时三年也完不成的。会上，并有十六个小组的工人提出保证书，保证一定做到好、快、省及安全的要求。先进瓦工小组组长戚同月同志上台表示，完全有信心提前完成计划。
    华北地质勘探队出发
    华北区四月上旬有十一个地质勘探队出发到野外工作。勘探地区有临近渤海的燕山地区，塞外的大青山麓，黄河东岸的吕梁山区，拔海二千五百公尺的中条山地区，峰峰矿区和太行山区。这次勘探的主要任务是为进一步发展华北的钢铁工业寻找铁矿和锰、石英石、白云石等矿产原料，此外也勘探铜矿。由中央人民政府地质部华北地质局组织的六个普查队的任务是普查已发现矿苗的地区；由华北地质局组织的两个预查队和山西省人民政府工业厅工矿研究所组织的三个预查队的任务是结合群众报矿，在普查队工作的地区周围广大区域进行预查。

    勘察山西省地下资源
    山西省人民政府工业厅工矿研究所全体地质工作人员，经过两个月的紧张学习，现已分四批出发到隰县、蒲县、长治、晋城等地勘察祖国地下资源。在学习中，大家批判了一些地质工作者认为“山西是窝矿，没有层矿”，因而没有多大开采价值的思想，坚定了工作信心，又学习了苏联关于各种矿产储量的分类和评价、按勘探的难易分别矿床类别、储量计算方法、观察点和观察路线、矿产地的经济估价、采样方法、槽探的实施步骤和要点，以及新的规范和定额等一套先进的地质勘察工作经验。三月上旬，他们曾到太原东山、晋祠等地作了实习。现在已有七个新技术员初步熟悉了地质普查工作的一般知识，学会了观察路线与观察点、填地质图和剖面图等方法。老技术员已能够初步掌握新的勘察方法。
    甲乙双方配合使工程提前开工
    哈尔滨一○一工地第一期工程提前开工。四月七日，瓦工已开始砌砖，木工完成的门窗口料加工成品超过工程需要二分之一；铁筋工也超额完成了计划。该工地所以能提早开工，重要原因是甲乙双方配合密切，从整体利益出发。例如：乙方暂设工程没准备好，甲方即帮助乙方解决了材料问题，修建二十五栋暂设工程作为工人宿舍，甲方并将现有暂设工程全部借给乙方使用，使大批工人得以早日进入工地。另一方面，乙方积极主动抓紧准备工作，有了困难主动向甲方反映，甲方积极设法解决。如最初乙方缺少干部，甲方即请求上级调配了干部。乙方发现甲方有缺点也立即提出意见。如水塔设计有很多错误，图纸没有说明窗户往哪面开，水泥没有注明规格，乙方便主动向甲方提出，很快就修正了。另外乙方还很尊重甲方的意见，当甲方提出工程质量上的缺点时，能够虚心接受，立即采取有效措施加以纠正。甲乙双方并建立了联席会议制度，在这个会上，他们曾商讨解决了有关工程检查、乙方暂设工程和木材干燥等三十多个问题。
    雷成模创造夹墙炼焦炉成功
    重庆国营四零一煤矿洗炼厂工人雷成模创造夹墙炼焦炉成功，每年可给国家增产节约八亿多元。
    去年十月，该厂因为冶金焦不合格，积压了三千多吨卖不出去，工人雷成模看见这种情形，很着急。经过研究后，他想出采用夹墙炼焦炉的办法，既可改进质量，也能缩短炼焦时间，回收率也会提高。他把这个建议提出来以后，经党委和行政研究批准，马上试验，结果回收率每吨达到百分之七十三·六九比旧炉提高百分之八·六九；在燃料方面，每吨比旧炉节约九三·八一公斤；在时间方面，每吨比旧炉节约三·二○五小时。全年可给国家增产节约八亿多元，时间还能节约二六七·八天，质量也显著提高了。
    在雷成模事迹鼓舞下，大家纷纷提出合理化建议，最近根据建议改进了洗煤机，每天洗煤从八十车提高到一百三十车，最高曾达到一百五十车。
    春天到了喜马拉雅山
    当藏北高原飞着雪花，狂风还在山岭上呼啸的时候，喜马拉雅山下的河谷地带，已经是温暖宜人的春天了。山坡上野花齐放，山桃花映红了溪流里的春水。
    驻守祖国边疆的人民解放军战士和当地的藏族人民，正紧张地进行春耕播种。解放军某部三天内就开好了五百多亩熟荒地。在战士们开荒生产的影响下，今年藏族人民的生产劲头更大了。
    藏族人民把解放军战士的到来，比喻为幸福的开始。人民的战士们从到达祖国边疆的那天起，就帮助藏族人民建设美好的家园，帮助他们耕地、打柴、担水和收割粮食，还把骡马借给没有耕牛的人家使用。藏族人民也像爱护自己的子弟一样关心着战士们。    （据新华社讯）
