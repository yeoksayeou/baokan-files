Editorial note: Before the start of this year's construction season, the Production Technology Bureau of the Central Construction Engineering Department focused on inspecting the quality of projects in Beijing last year, and initially exposed some problems. These problems illustrate that the construction departments' management is chaotic, leading cadres have one-sided views of rushing tasks, and neglecting quality and thrift are very serious. In order to learn from the experiences and lessons of last year, the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Department must mobilize the masses of employees to thoroughly expose the waste and lack of accountability in construction, establish a responsibility system, and ensure that the 1953 projects are fast, good, and economical.

Construction Engineering Department Inspects Seven Construction Sites in Beijing Last Year
    Discovers Most Projects' Quality Does Not Meet Requirements
    The Production Technology Bureau of the Central Construction Engineering Department dispatched three working groups in late February to focus on inspecting the 1952 project quality of seven construction sites under three state-owned construction companies in Beijing. The inspection results revealed that the quality of these projects mostly did not meet requirements.
    The three state-owned construction companies inspected were the former Central Construction Engineering Department Direct Engineering Company, North China Basic Construction Company, and Beijing Construction Company. These three companies were formed by merging many construction companies in May after the "Three-Anti" movement last year, and fully started construction in June. Due to the urgency of the tasks, most of the projects were carried out in a rush, and the quality of the projects was generally poor. At the ○20 construction site of the former Central Construction Engineering Department Direct Engineering Company, a total of 17,400 square meters of construction projects, including 12 office buildings and dormitories, experienced uneven foundation settlement and cracked brick walls less than two months after completion. Some buildings' drainage was so poor that the sanitary facilities were completely unusable. For example, in the North China Elementary School project contracted by the North China Basic Construction Company, the brick walls were not properly connected during construction, and the wall surface was uneven, with a maximum difference of 2 to 3 centimeters. Grouting was also insufficient, and one could see outside through the cracks in the wall. Other poor brickwork quality, poor jointing, honeycombing in concrete pouring, and uneven cement floors were common phenomena in the 1952 projects.
    The reasons for the poor quality are: First, many leading cadres ideologically neglect quality. For example, at the above-mentioned ○20 construction site, poor quality was discovered before the brick wall was even level with the ground. Many comrades repeatedly raised opinions, but the leading cadres turned a blind eye. Some even said, "Our quality is not bad! It's about the same as other places," and continued to mobilize workers to pursue quantity. It was not until it was discovered that the poor quality affected the safety of the building that they began to pay attention; but it was too late, and they had to take remedial measures such as adding ring beams, steel wire mesh corners, cement corners, and right-angle steel bars. This reinforcement project alone increased costs by more than 120 million yuan, and the losses due to the reduced service life of the building due to the reduced quality have not yet been calculated.
    Second, on-site management is poor, and most sites do not have planned management. The on-site organization is not sound enough, the division of labor is unclear, and the on-site democratic management committee is mostly a formality. Technical cadres are also trapped in general affairs, and the general shortage of technical workers further prevents ensuring the technical level of the project. For example, at a construction site inside Chongwenmen in Beijing Construction Company, fifteen bricklayers were transferred, and after laying brick walls for two days, they were returned because they did not meet the specifications, which took three days. Another serious problem in on-site management is that many projects are not constructed according to operating procedures. For example, straight seams are very common, and some have straight seams for dozens of rows of bricks, which seriously affects the project quality.
    Third, political work at the construction sites is weak, and some chaotic thoughts among employees and cadres cannot be corrected in time. Some technical cadres are afraid of taking responsibility, and sometimes they know that this method of operation will affect the quality of the project, but they dare not raise or insist on their opinions. Some workers also neglect quality in their thinking, pursuing quantity and excessive bonuses.
    In addition, the poor quality of the 1952 projects is also largely related to the poor design quality. For example, at the North China Elementary School and Transportation Cadre School construction sites, the stairwells were poorly designed, only taking into account the opening of large windows and neglecting the structure, resulting in the ring beams not being able to be properly connected. Also, in the foundation drawings of the North China Elementary School project, there was no design for the chimney. It was not until the upper layer was built that it was discovered that there should be a chimney, so they had to rework it, but because the foundation had already been made, it was impossible to properly connect the chimney with the outer wall.

### 建筑工程部检查北京去年七个工地的工程  发现大部分工程的质量不合要求

    编者按：中央建筑工程部生产技术局在今年开工季节前重点检查了北京市去年工程的质量，初步揭发了一些问题。这些问题说明了施工部门管理混乱，领导干部存在着片面赶任务观点，忽视质量，忽视节约的情况是很严重的。为了接受去年经验教训，北京市建筑工程部门必须发动职工群众深入揭发施工中的浪费和无人负责现象，建立责任制，保证一九五三年工程做到又快又好又省。
    建筑工程部检查北京去年七个工地的工程
    发现大部分工程的质量不合要求
    中央建筑工程部生产技术局在二月下旬派出三个工作组，重点检查了北京市三个国营工程公司七个工地一九五二年的工程质量情况，检查结果，发现这些工程的质量大都是不合要求的。
    此次检查的三个国营建筑公司是前中央建筑工程部直属工程公司，华北基本建设公司，北京市建筑公司。这三个公司都是去年“三反”运动结束后，由许多建筑公司于五月间合并组织而成的，六月份即全面动工。由于任务紧迫，大部工程都是在抢工的情况下进行的，工程质量大都低劣。前中央建筑工程部直属工程公司○二○工地，共一万七千四百平方公尺建筑工程，其中包括办公楼及宿舍十二幢，完工后不到两个月就发生基础不均匀而下沉及砖墙裂缝等现象。有的建筑物因排水不良，卫生设备完全不能使用。再如华北基本建设公司承包的华北小学工程，施工时砌砖墙不交圈，墙面凸凹不平，最多达二公分至三公分，灌浆也不足，从墙缝中能望见墙外。其他砌砖工程质量不佳，岔子接得不好，浇灌混凝土有蜂窝，洋灰地面不平等，更是一九五二年工程中的普遍现象。
    造成质量低劣的原因：主要是许多领导干部的思想上忽视质量，如上述○二○工地，当砖墙尚未砌过地平时，就曾发现质量不好，许多同志屡次提出意见，但领导干部熟视无睹。有的还说：“我们的质量并不算坏呀！和其他地方差不多”，仍发动工人追赶数量。直到发现因质量不好影响到建筑物的安全时，才开始注意；但时间已晚，只得采取加圈梁，钢丝网包角，洋灰抹角，直角钢筋等办法补救。仅此项加固工程即增加成本一亿二千余万元，至于因质量降低使建筑物使用年限减少之损失尚未计算在内。
    第二、现场管理不周，大部分现场都没有进行计划管理。现场组织机构不够健全，分工不明，工地民主管理委员会大都流于形式。技术干部又都陷于一般事务圈子，加上技术工人普遍不足，更不能保证工程的技术水平。如北京市建筑公司崇文门内一个工地调来十五个瓦工，砌了两天砖墙，因不合规格返工，倒用了三天。现场管理中另一个严重的问题是许多工程都没有按操作规程施工，如直缝的现象很普遍，有的十几行砖都是直缝，严重影响到工程质量。
    第三、工地的政治工作薄弱，职工和干部中的一些混乱思想不能及时纠正，有些技术干部怕负责任，有时明知这种操作方法会影响工程质量，但也不敢提出和坚持意见，有的工人思想中也忽视质量，追求数量，追求超额奖励。
    此外，一九五二年工程质量不好，和设计质量低劣也有很大的关系，如华北小学和交通干部学校工地，都因楼梯间设计不周，只照顾开大窗，忽视结构，致使圈梁不能交圈。又如华北小学工程，在基础图样中没有烟筒的设计，砌到上层时，才发现应有烟筒，只得重新返工，但因基础已经作好，无法使烟筒与外墙很好地衔接起来。
