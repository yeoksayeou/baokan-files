The Jin Opera (Shanxi Bangzi) was one of the twenty-three opera genres at last year's National Opera Festival. The repertoire performed at the festival included "Butterfly Cup," "The Gift of the Sword," and "Qin Xianglian." After participating in the festival, these Jin Opera actors broadened their horizons and took a step forward in their political and ideological understanding, beginning to recognize the importance of opera work. Those who previously thought that acting was just a means of making a living now understand that art is a tool for educating the people, and actors bear a significant responsibility to the people.

Now, the four Jin Opera troupes in Taiyuan are more united than before, making the usual year-end "troupe arrangement" work unprecedentedly smooth, generally conducting democratic salary assessments. Actors such as Ding Guoxian and Zhang Meiqin voluntarily reduced their roles, and many veteran artists want to pass on all their knowledge and skills to others without reservation. Some have handed over private costume trunks to the troupe and also reviewed their past erroneous practices in treating apprentices. In the past, young actors only accompanied famous actors in performances, with no opportunity for cultivation and artistic research. But now these young actors are working hard to rehearse, and the famous actors in each troupe also feel responsible for helping them rehearse well. In mid-March, a three-day performance for young actors was held. Previously, Jin Opera performers had doubts and concerns about state-owned troupes, fearing strict systems, lack of freedom, and reduced待遇. But currently, actors from the four Jin Opera troupes in Taiyuan all want to join state-owned troupes, only worrying that their political, cultural, and artistic levels are not high enough. At present, they are trying their best to carry out democratic reforms and establish reasonable systems, with female actors having maternity leave. Some actors believe that it would be their greatest honor to organize a troupe to perform in Korea to comfort the volunteers.

The Beijing festival not only improved their political and ideological level but also inspired their enthusiasm for delving into their profession. They studied the several reports they heard at the festival, combined with some local operas with strong realistic performance techniques during the festival, such as "Autumn River," "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," "Universe Front," "Drunkenly Beating the Mountain Gate," and "Yandang Mountain," studied the acting skills of those excellent actors, and learned how to deeply understand the plot, using highly realistic, concise, and appropriate artistic exaggeration to express the contradictions and conflicts in people's lives in feudal society. Actors with two or thirty years of stage experience also began to feel that acting was not easy, believing that relying solely on what the master taught was not enough, and that stylized performances of characters' actions and emotions could no longer satisfy themselves. Now, each troupe has established an art research group to jointly discuss the character of the roles they play and the shortcomings in their performances. How to strive to delve into the role, combine it with the plot, and strengthen inner performance has now become a topic of research for Jin Opera actors in general. They also began to have some grasp of how to distinguish the essence of people's nature from the feudal dross in the repertoire; everyone initially understood that the realistic performance art requires starting from the experience of life, so that the audience has a sense of reality, and so on.

Watching the performances on stage, the actors can better appreciate the arduous process of how good actors create roles. Ding Guoxian said, "The old boatman in 'Autumn River,' plays an old man in his eighties, but his spirit is like a youth, which is really not easy; performing the rowing of a boat on the Sichuan River is also no ordinary skill. For example, the realistic performances of Yue Opera actor Fan Ruijuan and Shanghai Opera actor Ding Shi'e, etc., can only be achieved through long-term hard work. She herself is also working hard to revise plays such as 'Four Scholars,' 'Spring and Autumn Brush,' and 'Catching and Releasing Cao Cao.'" Ji Meilian, who plays female roles, said that the true emotions of Aunt Zhang when she let Xier go in the Shanghai Opera "White Haired Girl" made her forget that she was watching a play. She felt that other people played who they looked like, and she should learn from them. Niu Guiying, a famous Qingyi in Jin Opera, believes that a set of rigid rules previously trapped the actors, that is, the formalistic and stylized performance methods, which prevented the actors from exerting their creativity. The Beijing festival broke this set of shackles. Sun Fu'e, who plays young male roles, felt after the festival that her previous attitude towards acting was not serious enough, and she liked to make jokes on stage to cater to the tastes of some audiences. This weakened the educational role of acting. Actors must be responsible to the audience and consider the impact of the performance. She saw from the audience's reaction that today's audience's level of artistic appreciation has been significantly improved, and formalistic performances that deviate from the plot are not as popular as performances that have been worked hard on and are reasonable. Hua Yanjun, who did not participate in the festival, is also studying realistic performance methods after hearing the transmission and is trying her best to study the character of the role. Seeing her performance of Jiao Guiying in "Qing Tan" now, one knows that her research work has already yielded results.

Generally speaking, the performance art of Jin Opera actors has improved after the Beijing festival, and the audience said: The trip to Beijing was really not in vain. Many actors are revising the plays they are familiar with. People who play Cao Cao are studying the demeanor and style of this character in different periods; people who play Bao Gong are trying to play this character, who represents the people's faint hope in the feudal era, well. The actors are all using their brains and can no longer be satisfied with the stylized set of things. In the rehearsal, they began to understand how to use the collective wisdom, and even the most grassroots actors had the right to speak. Everyone watched the rehearsal and gave opinions; after rehearsing one scene well, they rehearsed another scene.

However, after the Beijing festival, some new problems worthy of attention also appeared in the Jin Opera circle.

The absorption capacity of the Jin Opera circle is very strong. After the festival, "Double Butterflies" (i.e., "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai") and "Zhang Sheng and Yingying" (i.e., "The West Chamber") based on Yue Opera scripts have been staged; some troupes have newly rehearsed "Acacia Tree," and some troupes have performed "Little Son-in-Law"... In the young actors' performance, there were three "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" based on Gui Opera scripts, one "Blue Bridge Meeting" based on Jianghuai Opera scripts, one "Universe Front" based on Han Opera scripts, and "Three Slaps." In addition, they also performed "The Gift of the Sword," "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao," "Qingfeng Pavilion," "Shaohua Mountain," and "Choosing a Partner." This is a phenomenon worth noting. In fact, Jin Opera has been popular for a long time and has a deep foundation. There are many traditional repertoires that will be lost if they are not整理, and there are still some valuable old scripts in the hands of Jin Opera veteran artists, which are worth excavating, removing the dross, and then developing and improving on this basis. The National Opera Festival originally contained the meaning of friendly competition and complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses, but it cannot be mechanically moved over, or learn some superficial things—such as costumes and sets. Obviously, some external things of Yue Opera attracted Jin Opera actors and directors. For example, "Acacia Tree" spent a lot of money on the set, which restricted the actors' dance, body movements, and actions, and also adopted many Yue Opera-化 methods. The director's design abandoned the excellent and concise methods of traditional repertoires, and the unnecessary first scene "Honeymoon Night" was performed for more than an hour, while the final scene of King Song's "Playing with Fire and Self-Immolation" was very conceptual. The costume of the actor who played Yingying in "Zhang Sheng and Yingying" cost one hundred and eighty万, equivalent to her income for more than twenty days, which also seemed wasteful.

From the young actors' performance, it can be seen that the young generation of Jin Opera actors is very talented and willing to study, but there is still a strong master style in their performances, lacking creativity. For example, Chen Gong in "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao" is full of Ding Guoxian's flavor, and Princess Baihua in "The Gift of the Sword" has traces of Ji Meilian. "Choosing a Partner" is a script that promotes the Marriage Law. It is rare for local drama actors to play new characters as appropriately as the main actor in Jin Opera's "Choosing a Partner," although this is a very conceptual script. Jin Opera's performance of modern dramas is still in the experimental stage and cannot be regarded as a direction for development at present.

At present, Jin Opera should first select and modify some preserved programs from the traditional repertoires that have been honed for thousands of times. Distinguish and create in the inheritance of heritage.

Whether Jin Opera actors or musicians, they all recognized the harmony and beauty of the music of certain opera genres from the festival. Jin Opera's Bangzi and 大锣 are loud enough, so that some viewers are unwilling to buy tickets in the front rows when watching Jin Opera. This time, they saw Shanghai Opera, Jianghuai Opera, and Northeast Ping Opera, and because of the assistance of new music workers, there has also been great improvement in music. Jin Opera musician Bai Jinshan said that in the future, Jin Opera music must also strive for reform.

In the preliminary reorganization of local opera troupes into state-owned opera troupes this year, new literary and art workers—including new music workers—will participate in the state-owned opera troupes, and Jin Opera is no exception. Jin Opera actors have expressed their welcome to this kind of unity and cooperation. This is of great significance to the development of opera art.

    全国戏曲观摩演出大会对晋剧演员的影响
    子冈
    晋剧（山西梆子）是去年全国戏曲观摩演出大会中二十三个剧种之一，在会演中演出的剧目有“蝴蝶杯”、“赠剑”、“秦香莲”等。这些晋剧演员们在参加会演之后，扩大了眼界，在政治上、思想上提高了一步，开始认识戏曲工作的重要性。过去只以为演戏是为了糊口的人，如今也懂得艺术是教育人民的工具，演员对人民负有重大的责任。
    现在太原四个晋剧团内部比以前更团结了，使得去年年尾照例的“定班”工作空前顺利，一般地进行了民主评薪。丁果仙、张美琴等演员自动减少戏份，许多老艺人都想毫无保留地把自己的所知所学传授给别人。有人把私有的戏箱交给剧团，还检讨了以往对待徒弟的错误作风。过去青年演员们只是陪着名演员唱戏，谈不到培养和研究艺术。但现在这些青年演员都在努力排戏了，各团名演员也感到有责任帮他们把戏排好。三月中旬，举行了三天青年演员会演。从前晋剧艺人对于国营剧团还有怀疑和顾虑，怕制度严格，怕不自由，怕待遇减低。但是目前太原四个晋剧团的演员都想参加国营剧团，就担心自己政治、文化和艺术水平不够。目前他们尽量搞好民主改革，建立合理制度，女演员有产假。有些演员认为倘若可以组织剧团去朝鲜作慰问志愿军的演出，是他们最大的光荣。
    北京会演不但提高了他们的政治思想水平，而且激发了他们钻研业务的热情。他们学习了会演中所听到的几个报告，结合会演期中的一些现实主义表演手法较强的地方戏曲：例如“秋江”、“拾玉镯”、“宇宙锋”、“醉打山门”、“雁荡山”等，研究那些优秀的演员的演技，学习如何深入理解剧情，用具有高度真实性的、简练而又恰当的艺术夸张的手法表现封建社会中人民生活的矛盾和冲突。有着二三十年舞台经验的演员也开始觉得演戏并不容易，认为光依靠师傅所教的一套已经不够，程式化地表演人物的动作和喜怒哀乐也不能为自己所满足了。现在每个剧团建立了艺术研究组，一同研讨彼此饰演角色的性格和表演中的缺点。怎样努力深入角色，结合剧情，加强内心表演，如今成为一般晋剧演员所钻研的课题。对于如何分辨剧目中的人民性的精华和封建性的糟粕，他们也开始有了一些把握；大家初步懂得了现实主义表演艺术要求从生活的体会出发，使观众有真实感等等的含义。
    演员在台下看了台上的演出，更能体会到好演员如何创作角色的艰苦过程。丁果仙说：“秋江”里的老艄公，扮的是八十多岁的老汉，精神却像个青年，真不容易；表演川江行船，也不是普通功夫。又如越剧演员范瑞娟和沪剧演员丁是娥等的真实表演，都要经过长期艰苦的磨练，才做得到。她自己也在努力修改“四进士”、“春秋笔”、“捉放曹”等剧。演旦角的冀美莲说沪剧“白毛女”中，张二婶放走喜儿时的真实情感，使她忘了是在看戏。她觉得人家演谁像谁，自己应该好好学习。晋剧名青衣牛桂英认为以前有一套死规矩把演员们套住了，那就是形式主义的程式化的表演方法，使演员们不能发挥创造性。北京会演把这套枷锁打破了。演小生的孙福娥在会演以后才觉得自己以往的演剧态度不够严肃，喜欢在台上逗个笑话，迎合一部分观众的趣味。这就削弱了演戏的教育作用。演员必须对观众负责，顾到演出的影响。她从台下的反应中看出：今天观众的艺术欣赏水平已有了显著的提高，脱离剧情的形式主义的表演，就不如下过功夫、入情入理的表演受人欢迎。没有参加会演的花砚君听了传达以后，也在钻研现实主义的表演方法，竭力研究角色性格。看她现在演“情探”中的焦桂英，就知道她的钻研工作已有了收获。
    一般说来，晋剧演员们的表演艺术在北京会演以后有了进步，观众都说：北京一趟真没白去。许多演员在修改自己演熟了的戏。演曹操的人研究这个人物在不同时期的气度和风貌；演包公的人努力想把这个代表了封建时代人民微末的希望的人物演好。演员们都在动脑筋，已不能满足于程式化的一套了。在排戏中他们开始懂得了运用集体的智慧，最基层的演员也有了发言权，大家看排戏、提意见；排好一场，再排一场。
    但在北京会演以后，晋剧界也出现了一些值得注意的新问题。
    晋剧界的吸收能力很强，在会演后，根据越剧本子的“双蝴蝶”（即“梁山伯与祝英台”）和“张生和莺莺”（即“西厢记”）都已上演；有的剧团新排“相思树”，有的剧团演了“小女婿”……在青年演员会演中，有三出根据桂剧本子演出的“拾玉镯”，一出根据江淮剧本子的“蓝桥会”，一出根据汉剧本子的“宇宙锋”，以及“三击掌”。此外他们还演了“赠剑”、“捉放曹”、“青风亭”、
  “少华山”和“挑对象”。这是值得注意的现象。事实上晋剧流行的年代久远，基础深厚，有不少不整理、就将湮没不传的传统剧目，而在晋剧老艺人手中还有一些宝贵的老剧本，值得加以发掘，去芜存精，再在这基础上加以发展和提高。全国戏曲会演原含着友谊的竞赛，互补短长的意思，但不能生硬地搬过来，或是学一些皮毛——服装布景之类。显然地，越剧的某些外在的东西吸引了晋剧演员和导演。例如“相思树”里用了不少钱置布景，反而限制了演员的舞蹈、身段和动作，也采用了越剧化的许多手法。导演设计丢掉了传统剧目优秀的简洁手法，把不必要的第一场戏“洞房”演了一小时以上，而末场宋王“玩火自焚”又非常概念化。“张生和莺莺”中饰莺莺的演员的一件戏装就花了一百八十万，相当于她二十多日的收入，也显得浪费。
    由青年演员会演中，看出晋剧的青年一代演员是很有才能的，很愿意钻研的，但是从他们的表演中还存在着浓厚的师傅作派来，缺少创造，例如演
    “捉放曹”中的陈宫的就充满了丁果仙的味道，演
    “赠剑”中的百花公主的有冀美莲的痕迹。“挑对象”是一个配合婚姻法宣传的剧本。地方戏剧演员演新人物能如晋剧“挑对象”中的主要演员演得那么妥贴，是很难得的，虽然这是一个很概念化的剧本。晋剧演现代剧还在试验时期，目前是不能作为发展方向的。
    目前晋剧应该先从早经千锤百炼了的传统剧目中选择修改，定出一些保留节目来。在继承遗产中再有所甄别和创造。
    无论是晋剧演员或是音乐工作者，都从会演中认识到某些剧种音乐的谐调和优美。晋剧的梆子和大锣都够响的，以致有些观众看晋剧不愿买前几排的票。这次他们看到沪剧、江淮剧及东北评剧，因为新音乐工作者的协助，在音乐上也有了很大改进。晋剧音乐工作者白晋山说，今后晋剧音乐也要力求改革。
    在今年度初步整编地方剧团为国营剧团时，新文艺工作者——包括新音乐工作者，将参加到国营剧团中去，晋剧也不例外。晋剧演员们都表示欢迎这种团结合作。这对于戏曲艺术的发展是有很大意义
    的。
