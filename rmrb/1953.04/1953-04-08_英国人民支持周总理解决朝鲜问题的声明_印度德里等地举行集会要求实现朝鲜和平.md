Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 6th: Support for China's new proposals aimed at achieving peace in Korea is continuing to grow among people throughout Britain.

According to the London "Daily Worker" on April 4th, the Sheffield District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union passed a resolution welcoming China's attitude towards the possibility of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war and resuming armistice negotiations. The resolution calls on the union's executive committee to do its utmost to support the new approach and help bring about peace.

The North London District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union also welcomed Zhou Enlai's proposal on the Korean issue and expressed its belief that it expressed the views of all union members.

The North London District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union called on the British government to use all its strength to accelerate the Korean armistice and called on all members to express their views in the same way.

At the Caymes Colliery in Ayrshire, 170 miners signed a petition supporting Zhou Enlai's proposal.

Fifty workers at the Rosナーs clothing factory in Stepney telegraphed W.G. Edwards, the Labour MP for Stepney, asking him to support China's proposal.

The Hayes branch of the Electrical Trades Union passed a resolution welcoming China's proposal, considering it "an important contribution to resolving the Korean issue."

W. Corrick, the Labour MP for Bristol North East, gave a speech at the Co-operative Party's annual meeting welcoming new efforts to break the Korean deadlock.

A. Hughes, chairman of the Draughtsmen’s and Shipbuilding Technicians’ Association, called for an end to the Korean War and demanded that Britain not tolerate the expansion of the war to China. Speaking at the union's annual meeting in Morecambe, he said: "We should make it clear to President Eisenhower that we British are not participating in his collusion with Chiang Kai-shek of Taiwan... We are determined not to be involved in the mad attempt to turn back the wheel of history and get involved in war."

He opposed the restrictions imposed by the U.S. Battle Act on British trade and opposed the rearmament of West Germany. He said that the Korean War must stop.

In Kings Norton, North Birmingham, 300 people signed a petition demanding that the British government free the British people from the U.S. Far East policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 7th: London dispatch: The "Daily Worker" on the 6th published an editorial on the negotiations that began in Panmunjom on the 6th, saying: China further "proposed a new solution to the only unresolved issue hindering the armistice—the entire prisoner-of-war issue—thereby pointing out the path to achieving peace in Korea."

The editorial pointed out that the British people welcomed China's proposal with "absolute, genuine excitement" and criticized the call to strengthen the U.S.-British war alliance. The editorial said: "The British people do not want calls to strengthen the war alliance. They want calls to support the peace proposals of the Soviet Union and China. It has been a week since Zhou Enlai's statement was issued, and we are still waiting for the British government to state its clear support for this proposal. In the editorials of American newspapers, it can be seen that the prospect of peace has almost thrown them into a panic. Commentators in Washington say that this prospect of peace 'has come at a rather awkward time.'"

The editorial then emphasized the extreme importance of the British people launching a movement to force the government to support Zhou Enlai's proposal, pointing out that this is the most urgent task for all British people at present.

According to the "Daily Worker," on the eve of the resumption of Korean negotiations, groups representing hundreds of thousands of British workers expressed their welcome to China's peace proposals.

The Transport and General Workers' Union, representing 350,000 workers, unanimously approved on the 5th a call to the governments of all member states of the United Nations, asking them to accept China's proposal. At the annual meeting of the Transport and General Workers' Union in Scarborough, the union's president, MP Walter Pedley, was asked to declare: "Negotiations should be held as soon as possible." When Pedley said that the proposal put forward by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai satisfied the desire of the people of the world for peace, more than 1,600 representatives and union officials unanimously applauded and cheered.

The Yorkshire Association of Trades Councils, representing 27 trades councils, not only passed an emergency resolution in favor of Zhou Enlai's proposal, but also condemned Eisenhower for instigating Chiang Kai-shek to attack the Chinese mainland from Taiwan.

According to "Reynold News," the Co-operative Party conference on the 5th passed a comprehensive emergency motion proposed by the party's national committee, welcoming proposals aimed at reaching a Korean armistice agreement. The emergency motion also hoped that this would be the first step in improving relations with the People's Republic of China, thereby enabling it to participate in the United Nations Security Council.

Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: According to TASS, Delhi: Peace rallies were recently held in Delhi, India, and Kanoor, Malabar County, Madras Province.

A conference of peace advocates held at the City Club in Delhi on April 2nd was chaired by Major General Sok, a member of the Indian Federal Council. Dr. Kitchlew, chairman of the All-India Peace Council, was greeted with stormy applause when he appeared at the meeting. Kitchlew called on the United States and other Western countries to accept the proposals of the Chinese and Korean sides on achieving peace in Korea. Kitchlew said that the results of his recent visits to the Soviet Union and China convinced him that the people of these countries harbor deep affection and sympathy for the people of India. Kitchlew emphasized that the Soviet Union and China do not want war, and that the goal of all their activities is to maintain international peace.

"National Pride News" reported that 10,000 peace advocates attended the conference held in Kanoor. Adityan, a member of the Indian delegation to the World People's Peace Congress, delivered a speech at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency: Madras Message: Many members of the Madras Provincial Assembly in India held a meeting on March 27. The meeting passed a resolution calling for a stop to the Korean War.
