Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 17th: The winter training of construction workers in Northeast China has concluded. After winter training, 160,000 workers have improved their political and technical levels. This workforce has now begun to enter construction sites in succession, and they will play a significant role in this year's basic construction.
    The large-scale winter training for construction workers in Northeast China began in December of last year. In the first stage, workers generally received relatively profound class education and patriotic education. Their sense of responsibility as masters was strengthened, and conservative ideas and guild mentalities were greatly reduced. For example, Guo Yunhan, an old bricklayer at Dalian Seaport, learned special techniques for making imitation jade and building marble structures during the puppet Manchukuo period. He regarded these two techniques as treasures, refusing to even tell his own brothers. However, after political education during the winter training, he resolutely taught the techniques he had kept secret for more than 20 years to everyone. He said, "I am the master of the country, and I should be at the forefront!" The increased awareness of construction workers is even more prominently manifested in the urgent requests of many people to join the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. Shenyang's Third Engineering Company alone has more than 280 people applying to join the Communist Party.
    In the winter training's technical education, workers generally demanded to master new techniques and actively learn from advanced experience. Zhu Liansheng, an old bricklayer from the Third Work Zone of the Northeast Electrical Industry Bureau, thought to himself when the Su Changyou double-handed mortar squeezing method was promoted on the construction site last year, "What double-handed squeezing? Bricks still have to be laid one by one!" He would pick up his trowel again when people weren't looking. When others advised him to take on apprentices, he said, "If the apprentices learn all the skills, won't we old folks be useless?" He underwent a great transformation during the winter training. In order to learn advanced experience, he often stayed up late and actively helped young workers learn. Due to diligent study, both new and old workers have significantly improved their technical levels. Five hundred and ten workers at the Northeast Light Industry Bureau's Engineering Company generally improved their technical skills by one grade, and 5% of the workers even improved by four grades. In the winter training stone mason class in Dalian, not a single Grade 5 worker used to know how to build the outer skin of a wall, but now they can all build neat outer skins and wall piers. In the past, many units lacked special workers. After the winter training, a group of special workers has been trained. In the past, there were very few rebar workers in various construction units in Lushun. After they promoted Huang Demao's rebar assembly line method in the winter training, a large number of rebar workers who could read drawings, cut materials, and calculate dimensions emerged. The electrical workers trained by the Central Heavy Industry Ministry's Construction Engineering Company have mastered preliminary techniques. Construction units in Changchun, Harbin, and other places have trained plumbers and pipe fitters.

    东北十六万建筑工人冬季训练结束
    这支工人队伍已陆续进入基本建设工地
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】东北建筑工人的冬季训练已经结束。十六万工人经过冬季训练，提高了政治水平和技术水平。现在这支工人队伍已陆续进入工地，他们将在今年基本建设中起巨大作用。
    东北建筑工人大规模冬季训练是从去年十二月份开始的。在第一阶段、工人们普遍受到了比较深刻的阶级教育和爱国主义教育。他们的主人翁责任感加强了，保守思想、行会思想等大大减少了。如大连海港老瓦工郭云汉在伪满时学会了做假玉石和砌大理石的特种技术，他把这两种技术看成珍宝一样，连自己的亲兄弟都不肯告诉。可是，经过冬训政治教育，他毅然地把保守了二十多年的技术教给了大家，他说：“我是国家的主人，我应该走在前面！”建筑工人觉悟提高，更突出地表现在许多人迫切要求加入共产党和青年团。仅沈阳第三工程公司就有二百八十多人申请加入共产党。
    在冬训技术教育中，工人们普遍要求掌握新的技术，积极学习先进经验。东北电器工业管理局三工区老瓦工朱连升，去年工地里推行苏长有双手挤浆法时，他嘴里不说心里想：“什么双手挤浆，砖头还不是得一块块地垒！”趁人家看不见的时候，他就又操起大铲来。别人劝他带徒弟，他说：“徒弟都学会了手艺，我们老头子不就没用了吗？”在冬训学习里他大有转变，为了学习先进经验，常常深夜不睡，并主动帮助青年工人学习。由于刻苦钻研，不论新工人或老工人，技术水平都有显著提高。东北轻工业管理局工程公司五百一十个工人，技术普遍提高了一级，有百分之五的工人竟提高了四级。旅大市冬训石工班五级工人，过去没有一个会砌墙外皮的，现在都能砌出整齐的外皮和墙垛了。过去许多单位缺少特种工人，经过冬训，已训练出一批特种工人。旅顺市各建筑单位过去铁筋工很少，在冬训中他们推行了黄德茂铁筋流水作业法以后，出现了大批能看图下料、会尺码算法的铁筋工人。中央重工业部建筑工程公司训练的电气工人，已掌握了初步技术；长春、哈尔滨等地的建筑单位，训练了水暖工和管道工。
