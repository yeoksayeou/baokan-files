Following the steady commencement of the Marriage Law implementation campaign in Beijing in late March, extensive and in-depth propaganda and education have been conducted among the masses, achieving the expected results. It has now entered the consolidation and construction phase and is expected to conclude around April 15th.

The scale of this campaign is magnificent. The Beijing Municipal Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Committee Office and its affiliated branch offices have trained a propaganda force of over 28,600 people. This includes 1,300 municipal and district-level cadres, 5,800 grassroots cadres from industrial and mining enterprises, 400 cadres from institutions of higher education, over 11,100 cadres from various departments at the village level in suburban areas, Party and League members, and activists from various systems, 5,000 activists from urban street residents, and 5,000 police station chiefs, officers, and people's police. After training, most of these cadres have ideologically distinguished between the new and old marriage systems, recognized the importance, complexity, and long-term nature of implementing the Marriage Law, clarified the campaign's guiding principles and policy boundaries, criticized impatience and negativity, and played an active and due role in the campaign.

The primary form of propaganda in the campaign is to deliver reports on the Marriage Law to the masses. Responsible cadres from the CCP committees, administrations, and trade unions of major factories and mines have personally delivered reports to workers. Institutions of higher education have invited responsible cadres from government departments or mass organizations to give reports. Each district has extracted over 1,000 district-level cadres, provided them with training, and assigned them as reporters to spread the propaganda to the masses in designated areas. In addition to giving reports, a variety of propaganda forms have been adopted. Propaganda posters issued by the Municipal Office are widely posted in factories, mines, streets, alleys, villages, and even on trams. Beijing People's Broadcasting Station has added two special programs to promote the Marriage Law daily, and inserted content promoting the Marriage Law into programs for women, workers, and shop assistants. The Municipal Office has also organized film teams and performing arts troupes to perform 28 shows in rural areas. Professional drama troupes and mass drama troupes from factories, mines, streets, and villages have mostly performed programs related to the Marriage Law. The form of literary and artistic propaganda is most fully utilized in major factories and mining enterprises. Each unit has organized at least one literary and artistic propaganda evening, and some have also organized performances of literary and artistic programs about promoting the Marriage Law. The experience provided by key pilot projects of using typical figures to report to the masses for propaganda has been widely used and developed in this campaign. Propaganda forms such as explaining comic strips and storytelling sessions (i.e., telling stories of typical figures) have been created and are very popular among the masses.

Currently, the propaganda work of the Marriage Law implementation campaign has basically achieved household penetration. All 124 large factories and mining enterprises in the city, except for the public transport company which has not yet started propaganda due to production planning, have given one or two reports to the workers; most factories and mines have also universally organized workers to conduct group discussions and held one to several literary and artistic performance evenings. According to statistics, 70% to 80% of the workers in some factories have received in-depth propaganda and education once. The situation in each district is also the same: according to a survey of Xiliu Village in Haidian District, only 16 out of the 268 people in the whole village have not received propaganda and education, and the general masses have received at least one propaganda and up to five times. In Dingzi Street, Xidan District, 53 out of 56 households have received propaganda.

Through this propaganda, old ideas, old systems, and old habits have been criticized among the masses. New ideas of freedom of marriage, family harmony, and unity of production have taken root in people's hearts. The masses generally recognize the harm of arranged marriages and the benefits of free marriage, especially the elderly, who have the deepest experience of the pain of the old marriage system. Now that they understand the truth, many people say that they will no longer arrange their children's marriages. In the past, in some places, young men and women in love were discriminated against, attacked, or even subjected to open or disguised interference. Now the situation has begun to change, and everyone recognizes that love and free marriage are open and aboveboard. An old lady from Xibajianfang Village in the eastern suburbs used to feel unable to hold her head up in the village because her daughter got married through love. Now she was the first to speak at the symposium. She proudly said: "I didn't make a mistake, I didn't arrange my daughter's marriage." Some people also used the method of carefully calculating accounts to calculate the losses caused to production by their family discord. The workers' understanding of equality between men and women has also been greatly improved. They said: Women account for half of the country's population, and men and women are like the two hands of the motherland. If women are not liberated, it is like a person being pressed on one hand, and can only work with one hand. How much less work would this produce! They also said: The working class must lead mankind to a communist society, how can we oppose the liberation of women!

The masses welcome the Marriage Law and are willing to implement the Marriage Law. Therefore, family disputes and marriage disputes among the masses have also decreased. An old worker at the Fengtai Vehicle Depot had previously arranged marriages for his two daughters. After receiving propaganda, he went home and said to his daughters: "I was confused in the past and arranged your marriages." He brought the two men home and let his daughters talk to them themselves. As a result, the second daughter was willing to continue to associate with that person, and the eldest daughter was unwilling and broke off the engagement.

Now, the city's Marriage Law implementation campaign has basically turned to the consolidation and construction phase. Some grassroots units in factories and mines will continue to carry out one or two more propaganda sessions to the workers, and some streets and villages are preparing to cultivate the typical figures found in the campaign and establish good examples among the masses. In suburban areas, some are also preparing to make up lessons for individual villages with poor propaganda. All units are prepared to summarize the effectiveness of the campaign from bottom to top in the final stage of the campaign and formulate plans for regular propaganda and implementation of the Marriage Law in the future.

    京市宣传贯彻婚姻法基本做到了家喻户晓
    现已进入巩固建设阶段本月中旬可结束
    北京市贯彻婚姻法运动从三月下旬稳步展开后，在群众中进行了广泛、深入的宣传教育，收到了预期成绩，现已开始进入巩固、建设阶段。四月十五日左右运动即可结束。
    这次运动的规模是壮阔的。市贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室及所属各分会办公室，训练了一支二万八千六百多人的宣传队伍。其中包括市级、区级干部一千三百人，工矿企业基层干部五千八百人，高等学校干部四百人，郊区村级各部门干部，党、团员及各系统的积极分子等一万一千一百多人，城区街道居民积极分子五千人，公安派出所所长、干事、人民警察五千人。这些干部经过训练以后，大多数都从思想上划清了新旧婚姻制度的界限，认识了贯彻婚姻法的重要性、复杂性和长期性，明确了运动的方针和政策界限，批判了急躁情绪和消极情绪，在运动中发挥了积极的应有的作用。
    运动中主要的宣传形式是向群众作有关婚姻法的报告。各大厂矿企业的中共党委、行政、工会的负责干部大都亲自向职工作了报告，高等学校约请政府部门或群众团体的负责干部作报告，各区共抽调了一千多区级干部，加以训练后，担任报告员，分片包干，向群众展开普遍宣传。除作报告外，还采用了多种多样的宣传形式。厂矿、街头巷尾、乡村以及电车上都普遍张贴着市办公室印发的宣传画。北京人民广播电台每天增加了两次宣传婚姻法的特别节目，并在妇女、工人、店员等节目中穿插了宣传婚姻法的内容。市办公室还组织了电影队和曲艺团下乡演出二十八场。职业剧团和厂矿、街道、农村的群众剧团，大多数都演出了有关婚姻法的节目。文艺宣传的形式在各大厂矿企业中运用的最充分，每个单位都组织了至少一次文艺宣传晚会，有的还组织了关于宣传婚姻法的文艺节目的会演。重点试验工作中提供的运用典型人物作报告向群众进行宣传的经验，在这次运动中得到了广泛的使用而且有所发展。创造了讲解连环图画和讲故事会（即讲说典型人物事迹）的宣传形式，很受群众欢迎。
    目前贯彻婚姻法运动的宣传工作已经基本上达到家喻户晓。全市一百二十四个大厂矿企业单位，除公共汽车公司因订生产计划尚未展开宣传外，都已向工人作过一两次报告；大部分厂矿还普遍组织工人进行了小组讨论，开过一次至数次文艺演出晚会。据统计有些工厂百分之七十至八十的工人都已受到了一次深入的宣传教育。各区的情况也是这样：根据海淀区西柳村的调查，全村二百六十八人中，没有受到宣传教育的只有十六人，一般群众最少受到一次宣传，最多五次。西单区丁字街五十六户居民，受到宣传的有五十三户。
    经过这次宣传，在群众中批驳了旧思想、旧制度和旧习惯。婚姻自由，家庭和睦，团结生产的新思想已经深入人心。群众大都认识了包办婚姻的害处和自由婚姻的好处，特别是老年人，他们对旧婚姻制度的痛苦体会最深，现在明白了道理，很多人表示再不包办儿女的婚姻了。过去有些地方，青年男女恋爱受人歧视、打击甚至受到公开的或变相的干涉，现在情况开始转变了，大家都公认恋爱和自由婚姻是光明正大的事。东郊区西八间房村一个老大娘，过去因女儿经恋爱结了婚，她总感到在村里抬不起头，见不得人，现在她在座谈会上头一个发言。她骄傲地说：“我可没办错，没有包办女儿的婚姻。”还有些群众用算细帐的办法，算计自己的家庭不和睦给生产带来的损失。工人群众对男女平等的认识，也大大地提高了。他们说：妇女占了全国人口的一半，男女好比祖国的两只手，要是妇女得不到解放，就好比一个人被人家压着一只手，干活只能用一只手，这样要少出多少活呀！又说：工人阶级要领导人类走到共产主义社会，怎么能反对解放妇女呢！
    群众欢迎婚姻法，愿意执行婚姻法，因此在群众中的家庭纠纷、婚姻纠纷也就减少了。丰台车辆段有个老工人，过去给两个女儿包办订了婚，接受了宣传后，他回家对女儿说：“过去我老糊涂，包办了你们的婚姻。”他把两个男的接到家里来，让女儿自己同他们谈谈，结果，二女儿愿意和那人继续来往，大女儿不愿意就退了婚。
    现在，本市贯彻婚姻法运动基本上转入巩固、建设阶段。有些厂矿基层单位还要继续向工人作一两次宣传，有些街道和农村准备把在运动中发现的典型人物，加以培养，在群众中树立好的榜样。郊区方面有的还准备对个别宣传较差的村，进行补课。各单位都准备在运动的结束阶段当中，自下而上地总结运动的成效，订出今后经常宣传贯彻婚姻法的计划。
