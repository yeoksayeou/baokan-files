    On the night of the 1st, our forces on the eastern front captured an enemy position near Yanli, northwest of Mundeng-ri, within fifteen minutes, annihilating most of a platoon of the ROK 3rd Division. A few remaining enemies fled into tunnels. In the following days, our army completely cleared the remaining enemies in the tunnels, and bravely defeated the enemies who came to counterattack. By the 5th, our army had defeated many frantic counterattacks by the enemy, and annihilated more than 230 enemy soldiers. The most fierce battle took place at dusk on the 5th, when our army repelled eight counterattacks by an enemy battalion, annihilating 215 enemy soldiers.
    Our forces on the central front also carried out an attack battle on the night of the 1st. Our assault team, with artillery support, captured an enemy position held by two platoons of the ROK Capital Division in the Jincheon southwestern area in one fell swoop. Except for seven or eight who escaped, all the defending enemies were annihilated. Afterwards, our army repelled three counterattacks by small groups of enemies on this position, annihilating more than 80 enemy soldiers in total, and seized two light machine guns and seven semi-automatic rifles. On the night of the 2nd, our forces on the central front also strongly attacked an important position of the US 3rd Division near Zhongjiashan, northeast of Tieyuan. In just twenty minutes of fierce fighting, most of the defending enemy company was annihilated, totaling more than 140 soldiers.
