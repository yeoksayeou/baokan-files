Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 30th: The "Voice of Vietnam" radio station commented on Clark's visit to Vietnam on the 29th with an article entitled "Crush All New Conspiracies of the Aggressors."

The commentary stated: The French colonialists and their lackeys think they can use the American scarecrow to frighten our people. They think that begging for more American military supplies can save them from their predicament. This is an illusion.

It is well known that in recent years, the United States has been supplying the French colonialists with a large amount of military supplies. According to official American announcements, in the two years from August 1950, the US imperialists shipped to the French colonialists: 22,822 tons of military supplies, 13,845 vehicles, 781 tanks and armored vehicles, 234 aircraft, 246 naval vessels, and 85,900 rifles and automatic weapons. However, the French colonialists have been defeated and are increasingly falling into a more passive position. In 1952 alone, they lost 65,000 troops. As for the US imperialists themselves, people know they are a paper tiger. They abused the name of the United Nations and launched a war of aggression against Korea, but have suffered a disastrous defeat.

The commentary asked, under these circumstances, how can the French colonialists use an American scarecrow to frighten our people?

During his stay in Indochina, Clark visited many puppet troops, inspected fake officer training schools, and held talks with Salan, Bao Dai, and others. He openly declared that the expansion of puppet troops must be stepped up. These all show that the French colonialists and Vietnamese traitors, under the orders of their American masters, will intensify the conscription of our youth into the puppet army; they will intensify the implementation of the policy of strategic hamlets in order to more easily plunder our manpower and resources, and realize their vicious conspiracy of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese." They will increase the exploitation of the people in the occupied areas in order to obtain money and rice to maintain the puppet army.

The commentary concluded: In the face of these vicious conspiracies, we must heighten our vigilance, strengthen our unity, crush all the enemy's aggressive conspiracies with resolute struggle, and advance towards final victory.

    “越南之声”电台评论克拉克到越南
    法国侵略者用美国稻草人吓不倒越南人民
    【新华社三十日讯】据越南通讯社讯：“越南之声”电台二十九日以“粉碎侵略者的一切新阴谋”为题，评论克拉克访问越南。
    评论说：法国殖民者及其仆从以为他们可以用美国的稻草人来吓唬我们的人民。他们以为乞求更多的美国军火就可以挽救他们的困境。这是幻想。
    人们都知道，最近几年来，美国一直以大量的军火供给法国殖民者。根据美国的官方公报，从一九五○年八月起的两年中，美帝国主义运交法国殖民者的有：军火二万二千八百二十二吨，汽车一万三千八百四十五辆，坦克和装甲车七百八十一辆，飞机二百三十四架，舰艇二百四十六艘，步枪和自动火器八万五千九百支。但是，法国殖民者还是遭到了失败，并一天天地陷于更加被动的地位。仅在一九五二年，他们就损失兵力六万五千人。至于美帝国主义自己呢，人们知道它是一只纸老虎。它滥用了联合国的名义，对朝鲜进行了侵略战争，但已遭到了惨重的失败。
    评论问道，在这种情形下，法国殖民者怎样能够用美国的稻草人来吓唬我们的人民呢？
    克拉克在印度支那逗留期间，曾看了许多傀儡军队，参观了伪军官训练学校，和萨兰、保大等进行会谈。他公开声明必须加紧扩充伪军。这些都表明法国殖民者和越南卖国贼在它的美国主子命令下，将加紧把我们的青年抓入伪军；他们将加紧实行并村政策，以便更容易地搜括我们的人力和物力，实现他们的“以战养战”“用越南人打越南人”的恶毒阴谋。他们将增加对侵占区人民的剥削，以便得到维持伪军的钱和米。
    评论最后说：在这些恶毒的阴谋面前，我们必须提高警惕，加强团结，以坚决的战斗来粉碎敌人的一切侵略阴谋，向最后胜利前进。
