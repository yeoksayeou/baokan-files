Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: According to Vietnam News Agency, the French invading forces continue to suffer heavy blows from the People's Army in the northern regions of Hanoi and Haiphong.

	In the first three months of this year, while the French forces encountered great difficulties and suffered disastrous defeats in the plains of North Vietnam and the An Khe region of Central Vietnam, the local forces of the People's Army in the central region of North Vietnam launched a wide-ranging offensive against the French forces, eliminating many important strongholds of the French army, such as Ben Mai near Viet Tri, Gu Luo east of Hanoi, Binh Ping near Fa Lai, Wu Jiang in Bac Ninh province, and Da Loc in Vinh Phuc province. At the same time, they drove the enemy out of many other strongholds and attacked the provincial capital of Bac Ninh province several times. The victorious offensive of the local forces of the People's Army caused significant losses to the French forces in terms of manpower, weapons, vehicles, ships, and other equipment.

	Faced with such a predicament, the French forces were forced to transfer many troops from other battlefields to reinforce the central region and carried out "sweeps" in Chi Linh in Quang Yen province, Gia Luong, An Phong in Bac Ninh province, and Mei Xi in Vinh Phuc province. However, all these "sweeps" ended in disastrous defeats for the enemy. In Gia Luong and An Phong alone, the enemy lost more than 1,000 men.

	In the arduous struggle against the French forces, the local forces and guerrillas of the People's Army created many examples of tenacious fighting and defeating the enemy with a smaller force. Many guerrilla units in Bac Ninh province repelled repeated attacks by enemy forces that were numerically superior. A company of the People's Army local forces in Vinh Phuc province was awarded by President Ho Chi Minh for going deep behind enemy lines, overcoming difficulties to establish guerrilla bases, and carrying out guerrilla warfare.

Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: The Vietnamese People's Army continues to inflict heavy blows on the French invading forces on the battlefields of North and South Vietnam, achieving many victories.

	According to Vietnam News Agency on April 21st: On March 26th, the French army concentrated four mobile units to launch a "sweep" against the base area of the Vietnamese People's Army in Ninh Binh province, North Vietnam, with the aim of reducing the pressure on the French forces in Fat Diem city and taking the opportunity to conscript and destroy grain.

	The People's Army not only inflicted heavy blows on the invading French forces in Ninh Binh, but also launched offensives against the French forces on the fronts of Ha Nam, Nam Dinh, and Ha Dong in the Third War Zone, causing serious losses to the French forces. According to the statistics of the Third War Zone Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, the People's Army killed or wounded a total of 600 French soldiers.

	The People's Army units operating in South Vietnam also inflicted heavy blows on the French forces. On April 2nd, six French warships, fully loaded with French troops, attempted to invade the Plain of Reeds (Dong Thap Muoi) west of Saigon. These French warships were shelled by the People's Army, and four of them were sunk. 150 French soldiers were killed.

	On April 6th, French fighter planes carried out retaliatory attacks on the Plain of Reeds and one was shot down. The People's Army captured four heavy machine guns from the plane.

	On March 13th, the People's Army units in Bac Lieu province, 200 kilometers southwest of Saigon, crushed the French "sweep" against the An Xuyen and Tan Loc areas, annihilating 225 French soldiers, including two French lieutenant-level officers and 52 puppet soldiers who were captured. The People's Army seized three mortars, eight machine guns, and seventy submachine guns and rifles.

    越南人民军在各条战线上沉重打击敌军
    【新华社二十三日讯】据越南通讯社讯：法国侵略军在河内和海防北部地区，继续遭到人民军的沉重打击。
    在今年的头三个月，当法军在北越平原和中越的安溪地区遭到很大的困难和惨败的时候，北越中部地区的人民军地方部队就向法军发动广泛的进攻，拔除了法军的许多重要据点，如越池附近的本脉、河内以东的古螺、法莱附近的槟平、北宁省的武江、永福省的大禄等。他们同时把敌军赶出其他许多据点，并数次攻入北宁省省会。人民军地方部队的胜利进攻使法军的有生力量和武器、车辆、舰艇等都遭到了重大的损失。
    面对着这样的困境，法军被迫从其他各个战场抽调了许多部队赶到中部地区增援，并在广安省的芷灵、北宁省的嘉良、安丰和永福省的梅溪等地进行“扫荡”。但是所有这些“扫荡”都以敌人的惨败而告终。仅在嘉良和安丰，敌军就损失一千人以上。
    在和法军作艰苦的斗争中，人民军地方部队和游击队创造了许多顽强战斗和以少胜多的范例。北宁省的许多游击队曾击退了在人数上占优势的敌军的反复进攻。永福省的人民军地方部队有一个连队，由于深入敌后，克服困难建立了游击根据地和开展了游击战争，受到胡志明主席的奖励。
    【新华社二十三日讯】越南人民军继续在北越和南越战场上沉重打击法国侵略军队，取得许多胜利。
    据越南通讯社二十一日消息：三月二十六日，法军集中了四个机动部队向北越宁平省的越南人民军根据地发动“扫荡”，目的在减轻人民军加于发艳城法军的压力，并乘机抓丁和破坏谷物。
    人民军不仅在宁平对进犯的法军给予沉重的打击，同时在第三战区的河南、南定、河东各战线也向法军发动进攻，使法军遭到严重损失。据越南人民军第三战区司令部统计，人民军一共杀伤法军六百人。
    在南越作战的人民军部队也给予法军重大打击。四月二日，六艘法军舰艇满载着法军企图进犯西贡以西的水草平原（即同塔梅平原）。这些法军舰艇遭到人民军的炮轰，被打沉了四艘。法军被打死的有一百五十人。
    四月六日，法军战斗机对水草平原进行报复性的袭击，被打落一架。人民军缴获飞机上的重机枪四挺。
    三月十三日，人民军部队在西贡西南二百公里处的薄寮省粉碎了法军对安川和新禄地区的“扫荡”，歼灭法军二百二十五人，其中有法国尉级军官二人和伪军五十二人被俘掳。人民军缴获迫击炮三门、机枪八挺、冲锋枪和步枪七十支。
