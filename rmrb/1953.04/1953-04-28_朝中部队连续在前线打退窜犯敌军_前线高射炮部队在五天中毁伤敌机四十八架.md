On the morning of the 23rd, enemy troops launched incursions against four of our positions, including one near Yujishan Village northwest of Lianchuan, where they used three companies.

    朝中部队连续在前线打退窜犯敌军
    前线高射炮部队在五天中毁伤敌机四十八架
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】本社记者报道：二十一日到二十五日五天中，敌军在前线的窜犯次数较前增多。二十三日清晨敌军向我四处阵地进犯，其中向涟川西北鱼积山里附近我军阵地的一次窜犯，就使用了三个连的兵力。但这四处窜犯都被我军打退，敌军共计伤亡了一百九十多人。
    在前线上空，敌机活动也有增加。二十一日到二十五日，敌机平均每日出动九百二十多架次，比前五天增加了三分之一。但敌机的损失也增多了。在这五天中，单是我军前线高射炮部队就击落了十八架敌机，击伤了三十架敌机，比前五天击落击伤敌机的数字增加了八架。
    在这几天中，我军又打了几次胜利的袭击战和伏击战。二十二日夜间，我军某部在炮火配合下攻击铁原东北洪伏里的敌军阵地，全歼守敌李伪军第二师一个加强排，约八十多人。二十三日夜间，西线我军某部又在汶山西北的左哨北山消灭了敌军一个班。二十四日，在东线高城以南，我军一支伏击队歼灭了一股向我进犯的敌人以后，又把赶来增援的两个排敌军杀伤许多，先后共计杀伤敌军官兵六十多名。
    我军前线游动炮火，在这五天中共击毙击伤敌军五百零六名。
