    A Brief Commentary on Economic Life
    The incident of the inferior quality and enormous waste in the overhaul project of the Pingyuan to Gushan section of the Jinpu Railway is extremely serious. The main reason for the waste is the lack of responsibility during construction. The Jinan Railway Administration neither studied nor arranged the huge project, which involved a national investment of 37.2 billion yuan, beforehand, nor did they pay any attention to it after construction started. The Engineering Department of the Jinan Railway Administration, in order to "save trouble," also shirked responsibility whenever anything happened. The Jinan Railway Sub-administration and the Engineering Section then pushed things aside as well. As a result, such a huge project was in a state of chaos with no one responsible.
    Some leading cadres of enterprises have also made mistakes, and are also making mistakes, but they are indeed delving into things, learning, and improving their leadership work. These shortcomings and errors arising from lack of experience are understandable. However, the mistakes in the leadership of the Jinan Railway Administration are of a different nature; they occupy the position of leaders but abandon the responsibilities of leaders. Their leadership is only manifested in signing documents and issuing orders, and when faced with specific problems, especially major problems, their leadership role is nowhere to be seen. The higher-ups push, the middle pushes, the lower levels cannot push it away, and the problem cannot be solved, so they can only ruin the matter. If this bureaucratic style of pushing back and forth is not reversed, who knows how much more state property will be squandered by them.
    At present, there is a serious phenomenon of no one being responsible in basic construction, resulting in huge waste. This phenomenon of no one being responsible is mainly due to our lack of experience in basic construction. Therefore, we demand that all construction units mobilize workers to expose these phenomena of waste and no one being responsible, ask them to come up with ways to improve, and establish various responsibility systems; but not to investigate responsibility, settle old scores, or give them any punishment. However, waste caused by the irresponsibility of bureaucrats like the Engineering Department of the Jinan Railway Administration is not allowed. In the movement against waste and against no one being responsible, all basic construction units must give due criticism, and even appropriate punishment, to such seriously irresponsible bureaucrats.

### 反对施工中无人负责的现象

    反对施工中无人负责的现象
    津浦铁路平原至崮山间线路大修工程质量低劣，浪费巨大的事件是极其严重的。产生浪费的主要原因是施工无人负责。济南铁路管理局对这个国家投资三百七十二亿元的巨大工程，事先既不研究布置，开工后也不闻不问；济南铁路管理局工务处为了“省事”，也遇事推卸责任；济南铁路分局及工务科再来一个一推了事；结果这样巨大的工程就处于无人负责的混乱状态中了。
    有一些企业的领导干部，也有过失，也犯错误，但他们确实在钻，在学，在改进自己的领导工作。这种由于缺乏经验而产生的缺点和错误，是可以谅解的。可是，济南铁路管理局领导上的错误是另一种性质，他们占据着领导者的职位，却放弃了领导者的责任。他们的领导只表现于签署文件，发号施令，一遇到具体问题，特别是重大的问题，就看不见他们的领导作用了。上面推，中间推，下面推不掉，问题又解决不了，便只有把事情做坏。这种推来推去的官僚主义作风不反掉，还不知道要有多少国家资财被他们葬送掉。
    现在在基本建设的施工中，存在着严重的无人负责现象，因而造成了巨大的浪费。这种无人负责现象，主要是我们缺乏基本建设的经验所产生的。因此，我们要求各个施工单位发动职工揭发这些浪费和无人负责现象，要求他们想出改进的办法，订立各种责任制度；而并不去追查责任，算旧账，更不去给他们以处分。但是，像济南铁路管理局工务处这种纯粹是官僚主义者不负责任所造成的浪费，却是不能容许的。各个基本建设单位在进行反浪费反无人负责的运动中，对这种严重不负责任的官僚主义者，必须给以应有的批判甚至适当的处分。
