Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: The North Atlantic Aggression Group Council held a meeting in Paris from April 23rd to 25th. The foreign ministers, defense ministers, and finance ministers of the fourteen countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization attended the meeting. The meeting mainly discussed the Western European arms expansion plan and the "European Army" plan centered on arming West Germany.

    During the meeting, the U.S. government exerted pressure from all sides, forcing Western European countries not to relax their arms expansion efforts, to continue expanding their military equipment, and to quickly establish the "European Army." On the opening day of the Council meeting, U.S. President Eisenhower declared at a press conference in Washington that the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization must continue their arms expansion efforts and must continue to expand their armaments on a long-term basis. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also repeatedly emphasized at the Council meeting and at press conferences held outside the meeting that Western European countries must not relax their arms expansion efforts. Dulles also blatantly threatened the governments of Western European countries, saying that if Western Europe could not achieve "substantial progress" in ratifying the "European Army" treaty by the end of June this year, the United States would not be able to provide large amounts of funding to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The speed with which the "European Army" is established will greatly affect the United States' consideration of how much "aid" should be given to Western Europe. Dulles stated that even if the French do not agree to arming West Germany, the United States will arm West Germany separately. He also implied that if the "European Army" treaty could not be ratified, the United States would consider allowing West Germany to directly participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    Under this pressure from the United States, the Council meeting adopted the Western European arms expansion targets for 1953 and the Western European long-term arms expansion plan, and adopted the Western European plan to build military bases in the next three years. The meeting also passed a proposal put forward by the United States, stipulating that relevant Western European countries should quickly ratify the "European Army" treaty. A communique issued at the end of the Council meeting declared that the North Atlantic Group would continue to implement a policy of expanding armaments.

    However, this Council meeting did not eliminate the serious contradictions existing between the United States and Western Europe in continuing to implement this policy.

    Due to the strong opposition of the people of Western European countries to the expansion of armaments, and because the expansion of armaments has caused serious economic disasters in Western Europe, the Western European arms expansion plan has encountered great difficulties. Despite repeated urging from the U.S. government, Western European countries have failed to complete the arms expansion targets set for them by the United States. The United States was therefore forced to formally abandon at this meeting the huge plan, passed by the Lisbon meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council in February of last year, to establish nearly one hundred divisions of troops in 1954, and instead proposed that Western European countries expand their armaments on a long-term basis over the next two or thirty years to achieve this goal. The United States' imposition of this long-term arms expansion plan and the 1953 arms expansion target on Western European countries at this Paris meeting will obviously cause Western European countries, gasping under the burden of military expansion, to continue to advance on the road of expanding armaments, thereby causing Western European governments to encounter more political and economic difficulties. It is worth noting that after this meeting, reports from American and Western European news agencies rarely affirmatively estimated to what extent the Western European arms expansion plan passed at this meeting could actually be realized.

    On the "European Army" issue, this meeting also failed to eliminate the increasingly sharp contradictions between the United States and Western Europe, as well as within Western Europe, on this issue. Although Dulles ordered Western Europe to ratify the "European Army" treaty by the end of June, problems arose even during the meeting in West Germany, the only country that had already passed the treaty in the Federal Parliament. The West German Senate decided on the 24th to postpone the vote on the treaty. According to a Bonn dispatch from United Press, this decision by the Senate may mean delaying the final ratification of the "European Army" treaty by West Germany for four or six months. A United Press reporter, reporting on the West German Senate's decision, said, "This adds a new destabilizing factor to an already unclear outlook." As for France, a Reuters Paris dispatch on the 26th said that the possibility of the French Parliament discussing the "European Army" treaty before autumn this year is very small.

### 北大西洋侵略集团理事会会议在巴黎举行  美国迫使在扩军重担下喘息的西欧继续扩军

    北大西洋侵略集团理事会会议在巴黎举行
    美国迫使在扩军重担下喘息的西欧继续扩军
    【新华社二十八日讯】北大西洋侵略集团理事会四月二十三日至二十五日在巴黎举行会议。参加会议的有北大西洋公约十四个国家的外交部长、国防部长和财政部长。会议主要讨论了西欧扩军计划及以武装西德为中心的“欧洲军”计划问题。
    美国政府在这次会议中，从各方面施加了压力，逼迫西欧各国不得放松扩军工作，必须继续扩张军备及迅速建立“欧洲军”。美国总统艾森豪威尔在理事会会议开幕的当天，在华盛顿记者招待会上宣称，北大西洋公约国家必须继续它们的扩军努力，必须持续不断地长期进行扩军。美国国务卿杜勒斯在理事会会议上以及会外所举行的记者招待会上，也一再强调西欧各国不得放松扩军工作。杜勒斯并且露骨地威胁西欧各国政府说，如果西欧在今年六月底以前不能在批准“欧洲军”条约上获得“相当的进展”，美国就不可能给北大西洋公约组织大笔拨款。“欧洲军”成立的速度将大大地影响美国关于应予西欧多少“援助”的考虑。杜勒斯表示，即使法国人不同意武装西德，美国也要单独武装西德。他还暗示，如果“欧洲军”条约不能批准，美国就要考虑允许西德直接参加北大西洋公约组织。
    在美国这种压力下，理事会会议通过了西欧一九五三年扩军目标和西欧长期扩军计划，通过了西欧在今后三年中建设军事基地的计划。会议并通过了美国所提出的提案，规定西欧有关国家应迅速批准“欧洲军”条约。理事会会议结束时发表的公报宣称，北大西洋集团要继续执行扩张军备的政策。
    但是，这次理事会会议并没有能消除美国与西欧间在继续执行这个政策中所存在的严重矛盾。
    由于西欧各国人民强烈反对扩张军备，由于扩张军备已经使西欧蒙受严重的经济灾难，西欧扩军计划已经遭到了很大的困难。尽管美国政府一再催促，西欧各国都未能完成美国给它们规定的扩军目标。美国因此不得不在这次会议中正式放弃了它在去年二月强迫北大西洋集团理事会里斯本会议所通过的在一九五四年建立起近百师军队的庞大计划，而提出了要西欧各国在今后二、三十年中长期扩军以达到这个目标的计划。美国在这次巴黎会议中把这个长期扩军计划及一九五三年扩军目标强套在西欧各国头上，显然将使喘息在扩军重担下的西欧各国继续在扩张军备的道路上前进，从而使西欧各国政府遭到更多的政治和经济困难。值得注意的是，在这次会议结束后，美国和西欧的通讯社的报道中很少肯定地估计这次会议所通过的西欧扩军计划究竟能实现到什么程度。
    在“欧洲军”问题上，这次会议也未能消除美国与西欧间以及西欧内部在这个问题上日益尖锐的矛盾。尽管杜勒斯命令西欧要在六月底以前批准“欧洲军”条约，但是，就在会议举行期间，唯一已在联邦议院中通过了这个条约的西德，又发生了问题。西德参议院在二十四日决定延期表决这个条约。据合众社波恩消息说：参议院这个决定可能意味着把西德最后批准“欧洲军”条约问题拖迟四个月或六个月。合众社的一个记者在报道西德参议院这个决定时说，“这是在已经模糊不清的前景中增加了一个新的不安定因素。”至于法国，路透社巴黎二十六日电说，法国议会在今年秋天以前讨论“欧洲军”条约的可能性是很小的。
