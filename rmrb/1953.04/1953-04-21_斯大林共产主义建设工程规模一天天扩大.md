Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: According to TASS, the great Stalinist communist construction projects such as the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, Kakhovka Hydropower Station, South Ukraine Canal, and North Crimean Canal are underway on an ever-increasing scale, and the builders are achieving one victory after another.

In the days leading up to the spring flood, the builders of the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station have clad the foundation pit of the right bank power plant with a solid armor made of metal and gravel: two thick rows of steel piles have been driven around the large and deep foundation pit, and millions of cubic meters of sand and hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of gravel have been piled inside and outside the two rows of steel piles. The left bank water gate foundation pit and other places have also been clad with this armor. Now, the materials for building the water cut-off dam are still being continuously transported, and the construction speed is constantly increasing. Dozens of people at the construction site are watching the ice and water levels of the Volga River day and night. Blasters are ready to blast the ice at any time to avoid ice floes damaging the project. The "May Day" labor emulation campaign on the construction site has recently been vigorously launched. The right bank builders victoriously fulfilled their "May Day" guarantee, and two factories at the foot of Mount Mogutov that can automatically mix 4,000 cubic meters of concrete per day started operation on the 16th. The degree of automation of these two factories is even higher than that of the automatic concrete mixing plant on the Lenin Volga-Don Canal construction site. In the near future, they will use their full production capacity to help the construction workers complete the guarantee of pouring 1.2 million cubic meters of concrete in 1953—the year of large-scale concrete pouring. In the southern and western foothills of Mount Mogutov, which contains a large amount of limestone and dolomite, some fully mechanized quarries with a depth of 15 meters and a length of several kilometers have been opened up. Many Stakhanovite workers there have increased productivity to nearly twice the quota.

At the Kakhovka Hydropower Station construction site, the workers are enthusiastically implementing their guarantee to complete the entire project one year ahead of schedule. At the end of March, they poured the first cubic meter of concrete into the foundation pit of the navigation lock chamber, and then the scale of concrete work expanded day by day.

The construction scale is also expanding at the South Ukraine Canal and North Crimean Canal construction sites. The main work on the first part of the main canal of the Lower Ingulez Irrigation System began at the end of March. The builders of the Nikolaev Oblast canal have begun to build a water pipe and a reservoir, and they guarantee to complete a 57-kilometer-long irrigation canal before the October Revolution Day. In Simferopol, the builders of the reservoir have begun pouring concrete on the water pipes that divert the water of the Salgir River to the new riverbed. In addition, a high-voltage power line will be established from Kakhovka to Snigirevka to supply the electricity required by the pumping stations of the Upper Ingulez Irrigation System.

### 斯大林共产主义建设工程规模一天天扩大

    斯大林共产主义建设工程规模一天天扩大
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联古比雪夫水电站、卡霍夫卡水电站、南乌克兰运河和北克里米亚运河等伟大斯大林共产主义建设工程，正在越来越大的规模上进行着，建筑者们获得了接二连三的胜利。
    古比雪夫水电站的建筑者们在春汛即将到来的日子里，已给右岸电力厂的基坑穿上了由金属和石子做成的坚固的铠甲：在大而深的基坑周围打了两道厚厚的钢桩，在两道钢桩的内外堆了几百万公方沙子和几十万公方石子。左岸水门基坑等处也穿上了这种铠甲。现在，建筑拒水堰的材料还在不断地运来，建筑速度不断地增加。工地上有好几十人日以继夜地注视着伏尔加河的冰层和水位。爆破手准备随时炸开冰层，以避免冰块侵害工程。工地上的“五一”节劳动竞赛最近已经蓬勃展开。右岸建筑者胜利地执行了他们的“五一”保证，摩古托夫山麓两座每天可以自动调制四千公方混凝土的工厂，已在十六日开工了。这两座工厂的自动化程度比列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河工地上的自动混凝土搅拌厂还要高。不久的将来，它们将以全部生产能力，帮助建筑工人完成一九五三年——大量浇灌混凝土的一年——浇灌一百二十万公方混凝土的保证。在蕴藏有大量石灰石和白云石的摩古托夫山南麓和西麓，已经开辟了一些深达十五公尺，长达数公里的充分机械化了的采石场。那里的许多斯塔哈诺夫式工作者把生产率提高到将近为定额的两倍。
    在卡霍夫卡水电站工地上，工人们正在热情鼓舞地执行他们要提前一年完成全部工程的保证。三月底他们把第一公方混凝土灌入航行闸舱的基坑中，接着混凝土的工程规模一天天扩大了。
    在南乌克兰运河和北克里米亚运河工地上，建筑规模也正在扩大。下英古列茨灌溉系统干渠的第一部分的主要工作已在三月底开始。尼科拉耶夫州干渠的建筑者们已开始建筑一条水管和一个水库，他们保证在十月革命节以前完成一条长达五十七公里的灌溉渠。在森佛罗波尔，水库的建筑者已经开始在把萨尔基尔河水导向新河床的水管上浇灌混凝土。此外，从卡霍夫卡到斯尼吉列夫卡，还将建立一条高压电线来供应上英古列茨灌溉系统各抽水站所需的电力。
