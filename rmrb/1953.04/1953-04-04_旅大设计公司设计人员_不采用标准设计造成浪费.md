Designers at the Lüda Design Company are unwilling to adopt standard designs, resulting in slow and wasteful engineering designs. For example, the design of the Science Research Institute's cafeteria could have been completed in one to one and a half days if standard designs had been adopted, but they took a full thirteen days. The spacing between beam-supporting columns should have been uniform, but they designed three different widths. According to general standards, the safety coefficient for red and white pine wood is 500 kilograms per cubic meter, but in this engineering design, they increased it to 650 kilograms without any basis. The standard specification for supports is double teeth, but the designer insisted on designing a single tooth with a tenon board designed separately. This not only wasted design man-hours and national resources but also created difficulties for construction. It is estimated that if construction were carried out according to the drawings of this design, it would use 23 percent more materials than a standard design. Another example is the preliminary design of the recently completed Maritime Academy project, which did not follow the standard design for the girls' dormitory, resulting in two single-story buildings instead of one two-story building. This not only increased the land area but also wasted the materials for one foundation and one roof. The door and window designs for the faculty and staff dormitory project could have adopted a single standard, but they designed seven or eight types, some vertical, some horizontal, some square, and some round, all of different sizes. The Maritime Academy's design now needs to be reworked. Learning from this lesson, the leadership of the Lüda Design Company has begun to pay attention to conducting ideological education for designers and is starting to strengthen design review work.

### 旅大设计公司设计人员  不采用标准设计造成浪费

    不采用标准设计造成浪费
    旅大设计公司的设计人员不愿意采用标准设计，使某些工程设计又慢又浪费。譬如科学研究所食堂工程，如采用标准设计，一天到一天半就可以设计完，但他们却整整做了十三天。梁挂柱的间隔宽度本来应该一样，他们却设计了三种不同的宽度；根据一般标准，红白松木材每立方公尺的安全系数为载重五百公斤，他们在这项工程设计中却毫无根据地增加到六百五十公斤；支承处按标准规定是双齿，但是设计的人却偏偏要设计一个齿，另设计上一个篏板。这样，不但浪费了设计工时和国家资财，也给施工造成了困难。据计算，如按这次设计的图纸施工，要比按标准设计多使用材料百分之二十三。又如最近完成的航海学院工程的初步设计，没有按标准设计女生宿舍工程，结果把一栋二层楼房，设计成了两栋一层房屋。这不但增大占地面积，而且浪费了一个地基和一个房盖工程的材料。教职员宿舍工程门窗设计本来可以采取一种标准，他们却设计了七、八种，有的竖，有的横，有的方，有的圆，大小都不一样。现在航海学院的设计要返工重做了。接受这次教训，旅大设计公司的领导上已开始注意向设计人员进行思想教育，着手加强设计审核工作。
