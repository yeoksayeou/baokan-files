Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement calling on the Japanese people to lead the general election to victory and advance towards the goal of establishing a peaceful, independent, democratic, and free people's government.

The statement said: The motion of no confidence against the Yoshida government has been passed in the House of Representatives. The people's anger no longer allows the Yoshida government to continue to exist. All traitorous bills have been shelved. The Yoshida government's ambition to ignore the will of the people, attempt to strengthen the American occupation system, enslave the people, and force the people to fight in a war to restore militarism has been frustrated. This is the first step in the people's victory.

However, the Yoshida government still refuses to admit defeat and has blatantly challenged the people by dissolving the Diet. They are trying to force the people to act according to the will of the United States. The Japanese people will give a strong counterattack to this measure and consolidate their victory.

The statement pointed out: The Japanese people will no longer tolerate a second or third Yoshida government. The Japanese people demand the establishment of their own government, a government that defends peace and independence. This government dares to tear up the San Francisco Peace Treaty and other treaties of national subjugation that deprive Japan of its independence and make the American occupation permanent, and is able to clear all foreign troops from Japanese territory and remove American military bases. The unanimous demand of the people of the whole country is to defend peace, adhere to independence, and establish equal and friendly relations with foreign countries.

The statement said: If the people of the whole country unite, they will certainly be able to realize such a government. The Japanese Communist Party calls on the people of the whole country to unite and overthrow the Yoshida Liberal Party and the small handful of reactionary forces it colludes with. This struggle is the path to guaranteeing the victory of the people in the Diet elections.

The statement concluded: The Japanese Communist Party will devote all its efforts to fighting for the victory of the people of the whole country, and calls on all patriotic democratic parties to unite firmly and establish a peaceful, independent, democratic, and free people's government.

    日共号召日本人民争取大选胜利
    建立和平、独立、民主、自由的人民政府
    【新华社七日讯】东京消息：日本共产党发表声明，号召日本人民把大选引向胜利，并朝着建立和平、独立、民主、自由的人民政府的目标前进。
    声明说：对吉田政府的不信任案已在众议院通过。人民的忿怒已经不容许吉田政府再继续存在下去。各项卖国法案已经全部都被搁置起来。吉田政府忽视人民的意志、企图加强美国占领制度、奴役人民并强迫人民去打仗的恢复军国主义的野心遭到了挫折。这是人民获得胜利的第一步。
    但是，吉田政府还不承认失败，竟悍然以解散国会来向人民挑战。他们强要迫使人民按照美国的意志行事。对于这种措施，日本人民将给以强烈的反击，巩固胜利。
    声明指出：日本人民已经不再容许有第二个或第三个吉田政府。日本人民要求建立人民自己的政府，一个保卫和平和独立的政府。这个政府敢于撕毁剥夺日本独立、使美国占领变成永久性的旧金山和约等亡国条约，能够从日本领土上扫清一切外国军队并撤除美国军事基地。全国人民的一致要求是保卫和平，坚守独立，和外国建立平等友好的关系。
    声明说：全国人民团结起来，就一定能够使这样的政府实现。日本共产党号召全国人民团结一致，打倒吉田自由党和它所勾结的一小撮反动势力。这个斗争就是在国会议员选举中保证人民胜利的道路。
    声明最后说：日本共产党将全力为争取全国人民的胜利而奋斗，并号召一切爱国的民主党派巩固地团结起来，建立和平、独立、民主、自由的人民政府。
