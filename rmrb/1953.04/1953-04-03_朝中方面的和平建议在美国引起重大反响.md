Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 1st (TASS): The exchange of letters between General Clark and Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai, as well as the statement by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, regarding the exchange of prisoners of war and the Korean armistice negotiations, have aroused enthusiastic commentary in American public opinion. According to a United Press correspondent in Washington, D.C., Zhou Enlai's statement has left the U.S. capital "filled with cautious hope: Korean peace might finally be achieved." The reporter pointed out that the State Department is currently maintaining an "absolutely cautious attitude," and will not make any official statement until it receives a formal proposal from Zhou Enlai. "However, foreign diplomats stationed in Washington are expressing more optimism about Zhou Enlai's proposal than American representatives." The reporter pointed out that the U.S. State Department and all its "allies" are maintaining close contact on the issue of recent events. The Associated Press believes that the drop in stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange on March 30th was "the most severe in the past two years." The Associated Press also pointed out the sharp decline in commodity market prices. According to news from the United Nations Headquarters, the President of the Seventh United Nations General Assembly, Pearson, said that Zhou Enlai's proposal is "a very significant event, and undoubtedly, this proposal should be studied."

    朝中方面的和平建议在美国引起重大反响
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社纽约一日讯：克拉克将军和金日成元帅及彭德怀将军之间的信件交换，以及中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来关于交换战俘和朝鲜停战谈判的声明，引起美国舆论热烈的评论。据合众社驻华盛顿记者报道，由于周恩来的声明，美国首都“充满着慎重的希望：朝鲜的和平可能最后会达到了”。记者指出：目前，国务院抱定“绝对慎重的态度”，在没有接到周恩来正式的建议以前，国务院不作任何官方声明，“但是，驻华盛顿的外国外交官员们，对周恩来的建议比美国的代表们表示着更多的乐观情绪”。记者指出：美国国务院和它的一切“盟国”在最近事件的问题上，保持着密切的联系。美联社认为：三月三十日纽约交易所股票价格的跌落，是“最近两年来最猛烈的一次”。美联社还指出了商品市场价格的急剧下跌。据联合国总部消息，第七届联合国大会主席皮尔逊说，周恩来的建议是“十分重大的事件，无疑地，这种建议是应当加以研究的”。
