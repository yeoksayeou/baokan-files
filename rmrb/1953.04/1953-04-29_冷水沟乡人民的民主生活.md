    In the democratic political power construction over the past three years and more, the broad masses of the people in various regions have accumulated considerable experience in democratic elections, and their demands for democratic life have continued to increase, which has become the material basis for implementing universal suffrage and convening people's congresses at all levels. The democratic life of the people in Lengshuigou Township—one of thousands of townships—can serve as an example.

    Lengshuigou Township is located in Licheng County, Shandong Province, and is a semi-old revolutionary base area. As early as the end of 1950, when the township completed land reform, at the request of the people, all 638 households in the township were divided into five electoral districts and 51 residential groups, and representatives were elected to convene the first township people's representative meeting. At the meeting, the township head and deputy township head and members of the township people's government were elected, and the township people's government committee was established. In the past two years, the township people's representative meetings have basically been held and re-elected on time, and the township people's government committee has also undergone re-election.

    Through the tempering of land reform, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the political consciousness of the people of Lengshuigou Township has greatly improved, and they have realized how to exercise their democratic rights. Therefore, they all regard the convening of the township people's representative meeting as a major event and actively and conscientiously participate in the election. When electing township people's representatives in January of this year, the people in the Li Zongxiang residential group in the fourth electoral district, although they were usually very familiar with each other, spent two full nights selecting representatives, proposing three candidates, and after repeated comparisons and discussions, they elected the representatives. In the Li Fenggong residential group in the third electoral district, before the election of representatives, some people expressed to the masses: "If I am elected as a representative, I must do a good job for everyone." Many people regard being elected as a people's representative as an honor.

    Because the township people's representative meetings earnestly discuss and solve the issues raised by the people, the people solemnly raise matters to the representatives, no matter how big or small. During the agricultural patriotic production increase competition campaign launched last spring, many young women raised the issue to the representatives that their families did not provide clothing, and asked the representative meeting to help solve it. The representatives believed that although this seemed like a small family problem, if it was not resolved in a timely and appropriate manner, it would affect the enthusiasm of women to participate in labor and affect the development of the patriotic production increase movement. At the township people's representative meeting, the representatives conducted a detailed discussion on this issue and decided to hand it over to the township mediation committee for specific resolution. After mediation by the township mediation committee, the problem of more than 100 families in the township not providing clothing for their daughters-in-law was resolved, which played a significant role in enhancing the enthusiasm of women to participate in production. The number of women participating in field labor in the township was only 313 two years ago, but increased to 781 last year; previously, not a single woman had ever worked in paddy fields, but last year more than 230 women in the township went to the fields to transplant rice seedlings, weed, and harvest rice.

    The people of the entire township supervise cadres and manage township affairs through the township people's representative meetings, which has smoothly promoted various tasks. Last July, farmer Liu Xiwu told representative Xie Dianfeng: "The cadres in our township are generally good now, but the township militia captain Jia Yongtian is not doing a good job and is not democratic. He has never been to the mutual aid teams once, and he doesn't change even when criticized. We should ask him what he is doing at the next representative meeting?" Later, Jia Yongtian made two self-criticisms to the representatives at the township people's representative meeting. The representatives believed that his self-criticism was not thorough, especially his style of commandism was not deeply criticized, so they proposed to the township people's government to dismiss him from his position. After education, Jia Yongtian underwent a thorough transformation, and recently everyone elected him as the militia squad leader again. Last year, some people were unwilling to express critical opinions face-to-face due to concerns about face, so some representatives suggested that the township people's government set up an opinion box. Since the establishment of the opinion box, it has received 53 opinions from the masses, some suggesting that the work of substitute farming is not done well enough, and some criticizing the township cadres for shortcomings in their work style. After receiving these opinions, the township people's government immediately resolved some of them, and others were resolved or answered through discussion at the township people's representative meeting.

    The people of the entire township also exercised dictatorship over landlords and counter-revolutionaries who had not yet changed their class status according to law and who had been deprived of their political rights according to law through the township people's representative meeting. Last winter, after the mutual aid teams in the township cleaned out the landlords and counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the mutual aid teams according to the resolution of the township people's representative meeting, some landlords spread rumors and undermined the unity of the mutual aid teams. Therefore, at the township people's representative meeting, some representatives proposed: "There are still some landlords who are not behaving themselves and are talking and acting recklessly." Therefore, the representatives unanimously passed a resolution to post the list of landlords and counter-revolutionaries who had been deprived of their political rights on the streets to strengthen control.

    After the Central People's Government promulgated the Election Law and the Central Election Committee issued instructions on grass-roots election work, the political enthusiasm of the people in Lengshuigou Township was further enhanced. Each residential group conscientiously publicized and studied these two documents, preparing to enthusiastically participate in the upcoming universal democratic election movement.

    冷水沟乡人民的民主生活
    新华社记者  陈雨明  刘健生
    各地广大人民群众在三年多来的民主政权建设过程中，积累了不少的民主选举经验，对民主生活的要求不断提高，已经成为实行普选，召开各级人民代表大会的物质基础。人们从冷水沟乡——千万个乡中的一个乡——人民的民主生活中可以得到例证。
    冷水沟乡在山东省历城县，是个半老区。还在
    一九五零年底该乡结束土地改革时，在人民群众的要求下，全乡六百三十八户居民就划分了五个选区和五十一个居民小组，选出代表召开了第一次乡人民代表会议。会上选出正、副乡长和乡人民政府委员，成立了乡人民政府委员会。两年多来，乡人民代表会议基本上做到按时开会和改选；乡人民政府委员会也曾进行改选。
    经过土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命等运动的锻炼，冷水沟乡人民的政治觉悟大大提高，认识到应该怎样来行使自己的民主权利，所以他们都把召开乡人民代表会议看成是一件大事，都积极和认真地参加选举。今年一月选举乡人民代表时，第四选区李宗祥居民小组的人们，虽然平时彼此都很熟悉，但是在选举代表时大家却整整地选了两个晚上，提出三个候选人，经过反复比较讨论，才选出代表。第三选区李凤恭居民小组在选举代表以前，就有人向群众表示：“如果自己当选为代表，一定要很好地替大家办事。”许多人都把当选人民代表看成是件光荣事。
    由于乡人民代表会议对人民提出的事情都认真讨论和解决，所以人民不管事情大小都郑重地向代表提出。在去年春天开展农业爱国增产竞赛运动中，有许多青年妇女向代表提出家庭不管穿衣，要求代表会议帮助解决。代表们认为这件事看起来虽然是个家庭小问题，但是不及时适当解决，便会影响到妇女参加劳动的积极性，影响到爱国增产运动的开展。在乡人民代表会议上，代表们对这个问题展开了详细的讨论，决议交给乡调解委员会去负责具体解决。经过乡调解委员会的调解，解决了全乡一百多个家庭不管媳妇穿衣的问题，对发挥妇女参加生产的积极性起了很大作用。全乡前年只有三百一十三个妇女参加田野劳动，去年增加到七百八十一个；以前没有一个妇女下过稻田，去年全乡有二百三十多个妇女下田插秧、拔草和割稻。
    全乡人民群众通过乡人民代表会议来督促干部和管理乡内事务，顺利地推动了各项工作。去年七月，农民刘希武找代表谢殿枫说：“咱乡的干部现在一般都不错，就是乡民兵队长贾永田工作不好，又不民主。互助组里没见他去过一次，批评他也不改，下次代表会议上要问问他是干什么的？”后来贾永田在乡人民代表会议上向代表检讨了两遍。代表们认为他检查得不彻底，特别是他的强迫命令作风检讨得不深刻，所以提请乡人民政府撤销了他的职务。经过教育，贾永田有了彻底的转变，最近大家又选他为民兵小队长。在去年，还有些群众因为顾面子而不愿意当面提批评性的意见，有些代表便建议乡人民政府设立意见箱。意见箱设立以来，已经收到五十三件群众的意见，有的提出代耕工作做得还不够，有的批评乡干部的工作作风有缺点。乡人民政府接到这些意见后，有的立即解决了，有的便通过乡人民代表会议讨论解决或作了解答。
    全乡人民还通过乡人民代表会议对依法尚未改变成份的地主阶级分子和依法被剥夺政治权利的反革命分子实行了专政。去年冬天，全乡互助组根据乡人民代表会议决议，清洗了混入互助组内的地主阶级分子和反革命分子之后，有些地主阶级分子就造谣破坏互助组的团结。因此，在乡人民代表会议上便有代表提出：“现在还有些地主阶级分子不规规矩矩，乱说乱动。”于是代表们一致通过把被剥夺政治权利的地主和反革命分子的名单张榜贴在大街上，加强管制。
    中央人民政府公布选举法和中央选举委员会发布关于基层选举工作的指示后，冷水沟乡人民的政治积极性更加提高了。各个居民小组认真地宣传和学习了这两个文件，准备热烈参加即将来到的普遍的民主选举运动。
