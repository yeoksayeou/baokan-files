The heroic South Korean People's Guerrilla Force, inspired by the triumphant victories of the heroic People's Army and the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, is fighting for the freedom and independence of the motherland, ranging across the vast cities and villages of eight provinces, two cities, and sixty-two counties in South Korea. From the majestic Taebaek Mountains, Odae Mountains, Sobaek Mountains, and Jirisan Mountains, all the way to Mount Halla on Jeju Island in the South Sea, our People's Guerrilla Force has established bases everywhere, throwing the enemy's rear into chaos and terror.

Judging from the guerrilla warfare situation between March and October of last year, the number of battles fought by the People's Guerrilla Force increased by 177% compared to the same period in 1951, and the area of activity also expanded by 144%. With bold and flexible tactics, they attacked the enemy's command posts, sabotaged the enemy's transportation routes and communication networks, and inflicted ruthless blows on the enemy.

The Lee Hyun-sang Joint Force, centered on Jirisan Mountain, is carrying out heroic struggles in almost the entire area of North Jeolla Province and in parts of Northwest Gyeongsang Province, South Chungcheong Province, North Chungcheong Province, and North Gyeongsang Province. The Namdo-bu unit, fighting in South Gyeongsang Province and the southern region of the east coast, has also established close ties with the guerrillas active in Jeolla South Province, Gyeongsang North Province, Chungcheong South Province, and Chungcheong North Province, coordinating and organizing battles together.

The Lee Hyun-sang People's Guerrilla Force is a steel-forged team that emerged from the flames of the Jeju Island people's armed struggle in 1948, the struggle against the "May 10th" treacherous separate elections, and the Yeosu-Suncheon people's uprising in October of the same year, and has crushed all enemy "suppression" operations. Recently, this guerrilla force has conducted dozens of daring ambush attacks.

On December 13th of last year, a powerful combat team of this joint force, with the active assistance of the people, broke through the enemy's dense cordon and infiltrated Daeye-ri, Namha-myeon, Geochang County, South Gyeongsang Province, surrounding a section of the transportation route connecting Daegu and Geochang, where they lay in ambush. They cut off all the surrounding communication cables, and waited, gripping light machine guns, rifles, and hand grenades, eager to avenge the people. When trucks loaded with various military supplies and the Lee bandit army's 227th unit entered the ambush circle, they were stopped by hand grenades. Then, the guerrilla fighters rushed forward swiftly, killing the Lee bandit soldiers in the trucks and burning the military supplies. Afterwards, they moved to another location in the captured trucks. They also attacked the Lee bandit police branch in Bongsan-myeon, executed the heinous police officers, and burned down the branch. They also carried out propaganda and mobilization among the cheering people, suppressed the local tyrants and special agents, and then returned to their base.

The People's Guerrilla Force also formed many elite small unit detachments, broke through the enemy's encirclement, moved widely in cities and villages, maintained close contact with the people, grasped the initiative of regular combat, and further strengthened its ambush attacks against the enemy. Guerrilla groups frequently entered cities far from mountainous areas, attacking enemy troop assembly points, administrative organs, warehouses, and supply bases.

An excellent guerrilla unit of the People's Guerrilla Force in the East Sea area of Gyeongsang South Province, commanded by Comrade Nam Do-bu, skillfully broke through the enemy's blockade network and attacked key areas such as Ulsan, Dongnae, Gimhae, and Yangsan, destroying and burning the enemy's military facilities and administrative organs, while also threatening important railway lines such as the Gyeongbu Line. On June 16th of last year, they destroyed the Haeundae ammunition depot, which supplied 80% of the ammunition to the US military in South Korea.

The People's Guerrilla Force, operating with bases in the Chungcheong South and North provinces, appeared in key areas such as Chupungryeong Pass, Yeongdong, Simcheon, and Okcheon, holding down the enemy's military artery, the Gyeongbu Line. Since last summer, they have attacked enemy military trains several times, seizing many military supplies and burning trains and military equipment, often paralyzing the military transportation on this railway line. On January 2nd, they destroyed the Geumgang Railway Bridge on the way from Okcheon to Simcheon, burying nineteen cars of a US military train traveling from Seoul to Busan in the river, and killing many Lee bandit soldiers and police.

The People's Guerrilla Force in the Songnisan area also stormed into Chungju, North Chungcheong Province on November 3rd of last year, crushing the enemy's stronghold and achieving brilliant results with daring attacks. On December 22nd of last year, they raided the Lee bandit army's stronghold in Soi-myeon and Jeongpyeong, Eumseong County, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

The People's Guerrilla Force on the heroic island of Jeju, using the towering peaks of Mount Halla as fortresses, thoroughly destroyed the important military facilities in Seogwipo, met the oncoming enemy puppet troops and police head-on, and achieved victory. On November 15th, they also entered the Moseulpo area and carried out activities there.

The attacks and continuous activities of the People's Guerrilla Force on cities such as Busan, Lee Seungman's "temporary capital," and Gwangju, the capital of South Jeolla Province, made the enemy puppet leaders in these cities tremble with anxiety.

The reason why the People's Guerrilla Force is able to wage tenacious struggles and achieve brilliant victories throughout South Korea is due to the correct leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea and its close ties with the people. They inherited the glorious tradition of the anti-Japanese guerrillas led by the Korean people's beloved leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, learned from his rich and valuable experience, and received strict training under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea. They closely integrated armed struggle with political struggle. Each member plays a role in inspiring the people's struggle towards victory. They fight in close contact with the masses of the people and, through struggle, receive the trust and support of the masses.

Of course, the struggle of the South Korean People's Guerrilla Force is carried out in an extremely difficult environment under the encirclement and attack of a frantic and stubborn enemy.

In order to "suppress" the guerrillas, the enemy set up a "Garrison Command," under which there were "Combat Commands" in three regions: South, Central, and North. Under the direct command of US military officers, they mobilized US military aircraft and mechanized units, armored units, Lee bandit soldiers and police, local special agent groups, etc., to conduct concentrated encirclement attacks and carry out barbaric scorched-earth tactics.

Taking the winter of 1951 as an example, the enemy launched an operation to "suppress the People's Guerrilla Force" on December 1st. In order to cut off the People's Guerrilla Force's connection with the people and to block the guerrillas' activities, they implemented a bloody "martial law" in 80% of the area of South Korea.

In order to "suppress" the guerrillas lurking around them, the enemy set up a "Field Command for Suppressing Guerrillas" in Namwon-eup at the foot of Mount Jiri, and, regardless of the disastrous defeat on the front line at the time, transferred troops of division level or higher to the rear. The enemy used American aircraft and various heavy weapons to carry out inhumane massacres of the people day and night. In just two months after the "suppression operation" began, more than 60,000 farmhouses in North and South Jeolla provinces were destroyed and burned, the property of more than 200,000 farmers was looted, and more than 17,000 women were massacred for supporting the guerrillas.

The enemy's brutal methods not only failed to prevent the People's Guerrilla Force from attacking them and failed to cut off the flesh-and-blood ties between the people and the guerrillas, but on the contrary, the ties between the guerrillas and the people became closer and closer, and the flames of struggle rose even higher.

The male and female guerrilla fighters are all outstanding sons and daughters of workers and farmers, and are brave avengers.

The Hong Hyun-ki People's Guerrilla Force, based in the high peaks of the Taebaek Mountains, recently broke through the enemy's strict cordon and stormed into the Sangdong Mine in Yeongwol County. In close contact with the mine workers, this guerrilla force occupied the mine in less than 30 minutes, and executed more than 30 evil local tyrants, special agents, and other bad elements in the name of the people.

Currently, in the rural areas of South Korea, the People's Guerrilla Force is launching a struggle against the enemy's seizure of grain and to protect the farmers' harvests. They take back the grain seized by the enemy and return it to the farmers, eliminate the enemies who seize grain and massacre the people, and protect the farmers' grain and lives.

The people of South Korea deeply respect the People's Guerrilla Force, have infinite trust in them, and entrust their lives to the People's Guerrilla Force.

It is precisely because of this that the people can risk their lives, wholeheartedly sending grain, clothing, quilts, medicines and other supplies to the People's Guerrilla Force to support their struggle. In many places, farmers often secretly collect copper bowls used for making bullet casings and send them to the guerrilla's ammunition manufacturing sites. The people also hide the wounded guerrillas well in safe places and treat them. The detailed information and reconnaissance activities collected by the people also greatly help the guerrilla struggle.

Despite the enemy's exhaustive and brutal means to try to eliminate the People's Guerrilla Force, the People's Guerrilla Force is stronger than before. The reason why the guerrillas can not give the enemy a chance to breathe and severely hit the enemy is inseparable from the people's love and support.

Today, the South Korean People's Guerrilla Force is actively engaged in struggle in order to better realize the call of their beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung: "Male and female guerrilla fighters, with firm confidence in victory, must continue to strengthen and expand their ranks, organize various battles adapted to the environment, and mobilize the masses of the people in enemy-occupied areas to actively participate in the liberation struggle."

    南朝鲜人民游击队的英勇斗争
    朝鲜劳动新闻社调查部部长　申基观
    南朝鲜人民游击队在英雄的人民军和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军百战百胜的鼓舞下，为了祖国的自由和独立，纵横驰骋在南朝鲜的八个道、两个市、六十二个郡的广大城市和乡村中；在雄伟的太白山、五台山、小白山和智异山，一直到南海中的济州岛汉拿山上，到处有我们日益壮大着的人民游击队的根据地，使得敌人的后方陷入混乱和恐怖中。
    从去年三月到十月间的游击斗争情况来看，人民游击队的战斗次数比一九五一年同一时期增加了百分之一百七十七，活动地区也扩大了百分之一百四十四。他们以大胆、灵活的战术，袭击敌人的指挥处，破坏敌人的交通路线和通讯网，给予敌人以无情的打击。
    以智异山为中心的李铉相联合部队，几乎在全罗北道整个地区和在庆尚南道西北部、忠清南道、忠清北道和庆尚北道的部分地区进行着英勇的斗争。在庆尚南道和东海岸南部地区进行斗争的南道富部队，也和在全罗南道、庆尚北道、忠清南道和忠清北道等地区活动的游击队取得紧密的联系，共同配合组织战斗。
    李铉相人民游击队，是从一九四八年的济州岛人民武装斗争、反对“五·十”亡国单独选举斗争和同年十月的丽水、顺天人民暴动等斗争的火焰中锻炼出来的一支钢铁的队伍，粉碎了敌人的一切“讨伐”作战。最近，这支游击队进行了几十次果敢的埋伏袭击战。
    去年十二月十三日，这支联合部队的强有力的一个战斗小组，在人民的积极协助下，冲过敌人密密层层的警戒网，潜入庆尚南道居昌郡南下面大也里，包围了大邱通居昌的交通要道的一段，在那里埋伏着。他们把周围的一切通讯电线都切断了，紧握着要为人民报仇雪恨的轻机枪、步枪和手榴弹在等候着。当载满各种军需物资和李匪军二二七部队的卡车一开进埋伏圈，就被手榴弹炸停了。接着，游击队员们敏捷地跑上前去，打死了车上的李匪军，烧毁了军需物资，然后，乘着缴获的卡车转移到别处去了。他们又袭击了凤山面李匪警察支署，处死了万恶的警官，烧毁了该支署。他们并向夹道欢呼的人民进行了宣传和鼓动，镇压了恶霸特务，然后才返回根据地。
    人民游击队又把自己的队伍编成了许多精锐的小组部队，突破敌人的包围圈，广泛地运动在城市和农村，与人民密切联系，掌握了经常的作战主动权，进一步加强了对敌的埋伏袭击战斗。游击小组经常出入离山岳地带极远的城市，袭击敌人的部队集结处、行政机关、仓库和供应基地。
    南道富同志指挥的庆尚南道东海地区人民游击队的一个优秀的游击小组，巧妙地冲破敌人的封锁网，袭击了蔚山、东莱、金海和梁山等要地，破坏、烧毁了敌人的军事设施和行政机关，同时也威胁着京釜路等重要铁路线。去年六月十六日，炸毁了供应南朝鲜美军百分之八十弹药的海云台大弹药仓库。
    以忠清南、北两道一带为根据地活动的人民游击队，出没在秋风岭、永同、深川和沃川等要地，扼住了敌人的军事动脉京釜路。去年夏天以来，他们好几次袭击了敌人的军用列车，缴获了很多军需物资，并烧毁了列车和军需器械，使这条铁路的军事运输常常处于麻痹状态。一月二日，他们又炸毁了沃川到深川途中的锦江铁桥，水葬了从汉城开往釜山的美军军用列车的十九个车箱，并击毙了许多李匪军警。
    俗离山地区人民游击队，也于去年十一月三日突入忠清北道忠州粉碎了敌人的据点，以果敢的攻击战斗获得了辉煌战果。去年十二月二十二日，他们在阴城郡苏伊面和定平方面，又突袭李匪军的据点，使敌人遭受很大的伤亡。
    英雄的海岛——济州岛的人民游击队，他们以高耸入云的汉拿山连峰为城砦，彻底破坏了西旧浦的重要军事设施，迎头痛击了冲来的敌伪军警，取得了胜利。十一月十五日，他们又进入了暮瑟浦地区，在那里进行活动。
    人民游击队对李承晚的“临时首都”釜山和全罗南道的首府光州市等城市的袭击和不断的活动，使这些城市的敌伪头子经常陷于不安的颤栗中。
    人民游击队在南朝鲜整个地区所以能够顽强地进行斗争和获得辉煌的胜利，是由于他们有朝鲜劳动党的正确领导和与人民的密切联系。他们继承了朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅抗日游击队的光荣传统，学习着他的丰富的宝贵经验，在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，受着严格的训练。他们把武装斗争和政治斗争密切地结合起来。每个队员都起着鼓舞人民斗争走向胜利的作用。他们在与人民群众的紧密联系中斗争，并通过斗争，受到了人民群众的信任和支持。
    当然，南朝鲜人民游击队的斗争是在疯狂的、顽固的敌人的包围和攻击下，在极端困难的环境中进行的。
    敌人为了“讨伐”游击队，设置了一个“警备司令部”，其下并设有南部、中部、北部三个地区的“战斗司令部”，在美军将校的直接指挥下，动员美军飞机和机械化部队、装甲部队和李匪军警、地方特务团等进行集中包围攻击，展开野蛮的焦土战术。
    以一九五一年冬为例，敌人曾于十二月一日开始了“讨伐人民游击队”的作战。敌人为了断绝人民游击队同人民的联系和封锁游击队的活动，施行了在全南朝鲜百分之八十的地区内的血腥“戒严令”。
    敌人为了“讨伐”潜伏在他们身边的游击队，在智异山麓南原邑设了一个“讨伐游击队野战司令部”，不顾当时前线的惨败，将师团以上的兵力调到后方来。敌人以美国飞机和各种重型武器日夜不停地向人民进行惨无人道的大屠杀。“讨伐作战”开始了不过两个月，在全罗南、北两道就有六万余户农家被破坏和烧毁，有二十余万名农民的财产被掠夺一空，有一万七千余名妇女因为支持游击队而被惨杀了。
    敌人的这种凶残手段不但不能阻止人民游击队对他们的袭击，不能切断人民和游击队的血肉联系，相反的，游击队和人民的联系却越来越密切，斗争的火焰也更加高涨了。
    男女游击队员们都是工人和农民的优秀儿女，是勇敢的复仇者。
    以太白山高峰为根据地中心的洪铉基人民游击队，最近冲破了敌人森严的警戒网，突入宁越郡上东矿山。这支游击队在和矿山工人的紧密联系下，不到三十分钟就占领了矿山，把三十多个恶霸特务等坏分子以人民的名义处决了。
    现在，在南朝鲜的农村中，人民游击队正展开着反对敌人抢夺粮食和保卫农民的收获的斗争。他们把敌人抢去的粮食夺回来还给农民，消灭抢夺粮食和屠杀人民的敌人，保护着农民的粮食和生命。
    南朝鲜人民非常尊敬人民游击队，对他们寄予无限信赖，把自己的生命都委托给人民游击队。
    也正因为这样，所以人民才能冒着生命的危险，一心一意地送粮食、衣服、被子和药品等各种物资给人民游击队，支援他们的斗争。许多地方的农民，常常秘密搜集做弹壳用的铜碗送给游击队的弹药制造所。人民也将负伤的游击队员很好地藏在安全的地方，进行治疗。人民搜集的详细情报和侦察活动，对游击队斗争的帮助也很大。
    尽管敌人用尽一切凶残手段，企图消灭人民游击队，但是人民游击队却比以前更加强大了。游击队所以能不给敌人以喘息的机会，沉重地打击敌人，都是与人民的热爱和支持分不开的。
    今天，南朝鲜人民游击队为了更好地实现自己敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的“男女游击队员们，要以坚定的胜利信心，继续加强扩大自己的队伍，组织适应环境的各种战斗，在敌占区动员人民群众积极参加解放斗争”的号召，正积极进行着斗争。
