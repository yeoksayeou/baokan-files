Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 25th. The American "Daily Worker" published an editorial on April 20th, welcoming the news of the impending resumption of Korean armistice negotiations. The "Daily Worker" stated, "This is very good news." "The fact that both sides will negotiate at the conference table to resolve differences instead of fighting each other shows that the American people and the world can achieve peace as long as they insist on demanding peace."

The editorial mentioned that the U.S. negotiating representatives had fabricated the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, causing the armistice negotiations to become deadlocked, and warned: "The American people must pay close attention to ensure that they do not play the same tricks again to obstruct the ceasefire and armistice."

The editorial concluded by stating that peace is an achievable goal. The American people must ensure that the huge sums of money now used for death are diverted to health, families, schools, and a bright future.

    美“工人日报”欢迎朝鲜停战谈判即将恢复
    【新华社布拉格二十五日电】美国“工人日报”四月二十日发表社论，对朝鲜停战谈判即将恢复的消息表示欢迎。“工人日报”说：“这是非常好的消息。”“双方将在会议桌上谈判以解决分歧，而不是兵戎相见，说明美国人民和全世界只要坚持要求和平，就能够获致和平。”
    社论谈到美方谈判代表曾无中生有地制造交换战俘问题使停战谈判陷于僵局，警告说：“美国人民必须密切注意，务使他们不再玩弄同样的花样来阻碍停火和停战。”
    社论最后说，和平是一个能够实现的目标。美国人民必须确使现在用于死亡的巨额款项转用于卫生、家庭、学校和美好的将来。
