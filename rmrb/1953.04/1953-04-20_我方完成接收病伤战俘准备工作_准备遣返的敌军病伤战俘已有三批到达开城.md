Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 19th. The Korean Armistice Negotiation Korean-Chinese Delegation issued the following communique on April 19th:
    The staff officers of both sides' liaison groups have reached a complete agreement on all specific administrative details regarding the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war. Both sides agree that if new specific administrative details arise during this handover process of sick and wounded prisoners of war, they shall be resolved through consultation between the managing officers responsible for this handover work.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 19th. Tomorrow—April 20th at 9:00 AM, the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war between the two sides will begin. At present, all thorough preparations for the sending and receiving of sick and wounded prisoners of war by the Korean-Chinese side have been completed.
    In Kaesong, almost all of the larger public and cultural buildings have been destroyed, making it difficult to temporarily set up huge hospitals capable of accommodating thousands of people. To this end, the Korean-Chinese side mobilized a large number of engineers to repair several remaining buildings in the shortest possible time, and also erected hundreds of tents.
    Each temporary hospital on the Korean-Chinese side for receiving its own captured personnel is capable of providing emergency treatment for various diseases and performing emergency surgical operations. Now every hospital is ready, and the medical staff are eagerly awaiting to treat the comrades who have been made sick and disabled by long-term detention and frequent persecution and abuse. Half of the medical staff at one hospital have volunteered to donate blood to our captured personnel.
    A large number of books and cultural entertainment tools have been transported to the hospitals, and several cultural and artistic groups and film teams have also gathered in Kaesong. The hospital staff are also enthusiastically rehearsing many song and dance programs in preparation for welcoming the sick and wounded prisoners of war.
    As of today, three groups of sick and wounded enemy prisoners of war to be repatriated by the Korean-Chinese side have arrived in Kaesong on schedule. Another convoy departed from Pyoktong on the 19th and is expected to arrive in Kaesong on the 21st. Another convoy will depart from Suyang on the 20th and will arrive in Kaesong in the afternoon of the same day. While these prisoners of war are comfortably awaiting repatriation, new massacre news has come from the American prisoner of war camp on Koje Island. On the 17th, the enemy forces used shotguns, grenades, and poison gas to kill four of our captured personnel and wound forty-five.

    我方完成接收病伤战俘准备工作
    准备遣返的敌军病伤战俘已有三批到达开城
    【新华社开城十九日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月十九日发表公报如下：
    双方联络组参谋军官对遣返病伤被俘人员的一切具体行政细节问题已取得完全协议。双方同意在这次交接病伤被俘人员过程中，今后如有新的具体行政细节问题发生，由双方负责此项交接工作的管理军官协商解决。
    【新华社开城十九日电】明天——四月二十日上午九时，双方病伤被俘人员的交换就要开始了。现在朝中方面遣送和接收病伤被俘人员的一切周密准备工作都已完成。
    在开城，几乎一切较大的公共建筑和文化建筑都已被破坏，临时设置足以容纳数千人的巨大的医院是困难的。朝中方面为此调集了大批的工兵在最短时间中整修了几座残存的建筑物，同时又搭了几百个帐篷。
    朝中方面接收自己被俘人员的每一所临时医院都能够进行各种疾病的紧急治疗，施行紧急的外科手术。现在每一所医院都已准备就绪，医务人员正以热切的心情等待救治在长期拘禁生活和经常遭受残害虐待而被弄得病残的同志们。有一所医院的半数医务工作者都已报名要给我方被俘人员输血。
    大批的书报和文化娱乐工具已经运到各医院，好几个文艺工作团体和电影队也集中到开城。各医院的工作人员也满怀热情地排演了许多歌舞节目，准备迎接病伤的被俘人员。
    到今天为止，朝中方面准备遣返的敌军病伤战俘已经有三批按时到达开城。十九日又有一个车队自碧潼出发，预计二十一日到达开城。还有一个车队二十日自遂安出发，当天下午可到开城。当这些战俘正在安适地等待遣返的时候，从龙草岛的美方战俘营又传出了新的屠杀消息。敌军在十七日用散弹枪、手榴弹和毒气残杀我方被俘人员四名，打伤四十五名。
