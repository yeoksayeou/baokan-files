The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1953, No. 14, has been published.

This issue contains the decision of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on again reducing state retail prices for food and manufactured goods, and the amnesty decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on March 27th, and published an editorial entitled "Another Proof of the Great Vitality of the Soviet State" on these two decisions. The editorial stated: The Soviet Union's decision to reduce prices once again (the sixth time since the war) vividly demonstrates the continuously growing economic strength of this country, which is building communism, indicates the rapid development of Soviet industrial and agricultural production, and vividly demonstrates the tireless care of the Lenin-Stalin Party and the Soviet government for improving the material and cultural standards of the Soviet people. The price reduction measures implemented by the Soviet Union since 1947 have powerfully proven the role played by the basic economic law of socialism as discovered by Stalin. All the people of the Soviet Union welcome this price reduction measure with extreme satisfaction and great gratitude, and this price reduction powerfully stimulates the further improvement of Soviet productivity. This price reduction also proves that only countries whose entire policy is for peaceful construction can take such measures. The editorial pointed out: The root of all incurable diseases in bourgeois society has been forever eliminated in the Soviet Union. Thanks to the historically significant victory of socialism, the welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people have been greatly improved, and the level of citizen awareness has also been raised. The Soviet people's honest attitude towards labor, towards fulfilling their civic obligations, and towards Soviet law is an inherent characteristic of Soviet society. All this enables the Soviet state to take measures of prime political significance - the amnesty decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The amnesty decree reflects that the main functions of the Soviet state - economic organization and cultural education - are more important than in the past. How powerfully does this measure of the Soviet state, reflecting its ever-increasing power and confidently moving forward, once again prove the incomparable superiority of the socialist system over the dying capitalist system?

Under the title "New Steps in Consolidating Peace," this issue contains excerpts of the reply from Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to General Clark on March 28th, the statement by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, on March 30th, the statement by Marshal Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on March 31st, and the statement by V.M. Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, on April 1st.

This issue contains articles by: Mátyás Horváth, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, "The Eighth Anniversary of the Liberation of Hungary," Enver Hoxha, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, "The Albanian People Advance on the Road to Laying the Foundations of Socialism," Florimond Bonte, Member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, "The Economic and Political Situation in France," and Mincho Neichev, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, "The Ankara Conspiracy of the Fascist Aggressors."

In Bonte's article, it is pointed out that the economic crisis in France is developing in terms of scale and depth. The article states that the deterioration of France's economic and financial situation has caused great dissatisfaction and fierce resistance among all the working people of France, and the open revival of the West German fascist defense forces has further increased this dissatisfaction and resistance. The prospect of an intensified war in Vietnam and the threat of US imperialism launching a new world war have caused concern among the working masses. The movement that has already unfolded in France is so powerful that the rulers have not yet been able to ratify the Bonn and Paris military treaties. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第十四期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第十四期已经出版。
    本期刊载了苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会关于再次减低食品和制成品国家零售价格的决定，和苏联最高苏维埃主席团三月二十七日颁布的大赦令，并就这两个决定发表了题为“苏维埃国家伟大生命力的又一证明”的社论。社论说：苏联关于再一次（战后第六次）减低物价的决定生动地证明了这个正在建设共产主义的国家的经济力量在不断增长，表明了苏联工业和农业生产的迅速发展，而且生动地表现了列宁—斯大林党和苏联政府对提高苏联人民的物质和文化水平的不倦关怀。苏联从一九四七年以来所实行的减低物价的措施，有力地证明了为斯大林所发现的社会主义基本经济法则所起的作用。苏联全体人民都以极其满意和非常感激的心情，迎接这次减低物价的措施，而且这次减低物价有力地刺激着苏联生产力的进一步提高。这次减低物价，也证明了只有在整个政策都是为了和平建设的国家才能够采取这样的措施。社论指出：资产阶级社会一切不治之症的根源，都永远在苏联消除了。由于社会主义的具有历史意义的胜利，苏联人民的福利和文化水平已大大提高，公民的觉悟程度也提高了。苏联人民对待劳动、对待履行自己的公民义务、对待苏维埃法律的诚实态度，是苏维埃社会固有的特点。这一切就使得苏维埃国家能够采取具有头等政治意义的措施——苏联最高苏维埃主席团的大赦令。大赦令中反映了苏维埃国家的主要职能——经济组织工作和文化教育工作的职能是比过去更加重要了。苏维埃国家这种反映威力不断增加和满怀信心地向前迈进的措施，是何等有力地再一次证明了社会主义制度对于垂死的资本主义制度的无比优越性。
    本期在“巩固和平的新步骤”的标题下摘要刊载了朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军三月二十八日给克拉克将军的复信，中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来三月三十日的声明，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成元帅三月三十一日的声明和苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫四月一日的声明。
    本期刊载的文章有：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会政治局委员马东·霍瓦特的“匈牙利解放八周年”、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会总书记恩威尔·霍查的“阿尔巴尼亚人民在奠定社会主义基础的道路上前进”、法国共产党中央委员会委员弗洛里蒙·邦特的“法国的经济和政治形势”、保加利亚共产党中央委员会政治局委员明乔·涅伊切夫的“法西斯侵略者的安卡拉阴谋”。
    在邦特的文章中指出：法国的经济危机在规模方面和深度方面都在发展着。文章说，法国的经济和财政情况的恶化引起了法国所有劳动人民的极大不满和猛烈反抗，西德法西斯国防军的公开复活进一步加大了这种不满和反抗。加紧了的越南战争的前景和美帝国主义发动新世界战争的威胁，已在劳动群众中引起了忧虑。已经在法国展开的运动是如此强大，以致统治者们还不能够批准波恩和巴黎军事条约。（据新华社讯）
