    Stalinist Care for Children
    Zuo Lin

    In Stalin's era, Soviet children became the happiest children in human history. Comrade Stalin said, "I think there is no place like our Soviet Union that cares so much for children, for their nurturing and growth." Regarding the happy life of Soviet children, the Soviet people also had a heartfelt saying: "Under the sunshine of Stalin's life, the talents and abilities of Soviet children blossom like beautiful flowers."

    Stalin attached great importance to the communist education of the new generation, considering it one of the political tasks of national significance. He once pointed out: "...to educate the new generation in the spirit of proletarian socialism is the current primary task of our Party, and the victory of socialism is impossible without implementing these tasks." Stalin's attention to the communist education of children was the same as Lenin's. In May 1919, Lenin pointed out: "Children's organizations - this is a good way to educate communists." Subsequently, they created the world's first Young Pioneer organization and entrusted the glorious task of educating the Young Pioneers to the Communist Youth League. After Lenin's death, the Young Pioneers held a grand review in Moscow, where they swore to Stalin that they would abide by Lenin's teachings and inherit Lenin's cause. Stalin kindly taught them that the main task of children is to study, to cultivate their ability to master all kinds of knowledge, and to make themselves communists. After that, Stalin and the Party repeatedly instructed the Communist Youth League to strengthen the work of the Young Pioneers, requiring the activities of the Young Pioneers to correctly cultivate communist talents.

    Stalin's care for children was meticulous. He cared about their lives, their education, and he even personally participated in the compilation of children's textbooks. After the October Socialist Revolution, when the Soviet Union implemented the New Economic Policy and achieved significant success in the industrialization of the socialist country, Stalin immediately proposed the implementation of compulsory primary education. In 1930, at the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin pointed out: "We have always had to 'save everywhere, even save on schools' in order to 'save and restore heavy industry' (Lenin's words), but recently we have restored heavy industry and are continuing to move forward. Therefore, the time has come for us to start organizing universal compulsory primary education." Since then, under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet Union has developed children's education on an increasingly large scale. At the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin pointed out when talking about women's issues: "This situation is of great significance, comrades. It is of great significance because women account for half of our country's population, a huge labor force, and they have the mission to educate our children, our younger generation, that is, our future." Stalin also attached great importance to the training of teachers. At the same Party Congress, he pointed out: "The unacceptable phenomenon I am talking about is that teacher training 'departments' and medical 'departments' are still being neglected here. This is a major shortcoming that goes against the interests of the state. This shortcoming must be eliminated. And the sooner it is eliminated, the better."

    Due to Stalin's emphasis on children's education, the cause of cultivating and educating children in the Soviet Union has greatly developed. The state spent huge amounts of educational funds; many outstanding Party members and Youth League members participated in education. As early as 1922, at the suggestion of Zhdanov, the 11th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) decided to give one of the Tsar's palaces to the young people of Leningrad as a Children's Palace. Later, another palace of the Tsarist aristocracy in Crimea was given to the young people of the entire Soviet Union as a Young Pioneer camp. In 1948, Stalin also proposed to build more Children's Palaces for young people. From the following facts, we can also see how much work the Soviet Union has done for children: In the academic year 1950-1951, 2.25 million teachers were educating 37.5 million primary and secondary school students in 200,000 primary and secondary schools. Before the revolution - in 1914, there were only 8 million students in all of Russia. In addition, from 1933 to 1948, Soviet writers wrote 13,000 kinds of reading materials for children, printing 406 million copies. In 1950 alone, more than 100 million copies of children's textbooks were published. Now, Soviet children from the age of seven can attend school for free until they graduate from junior high school. In addition, a series of extracurricular children's institutions have been organized for children. The tasks of these extracurricular children's institutions are to assist schools in carrying out communist education for children, to help children deepen, consolidate and expand the knowledge they have learned in school, and to develop children's desire for knowledge and interest in learning. These extracurricular children's institutions - Children's Palaces, Young Technicians' Stations, Young Travelers' Stations, Children's Libraries, Children's Theaters, Children's Parks, Children's Railways, Artek Young Pioneer Sanatoriums, etc. - are all over the country, totaling more than 2,000. In addition, there are special children's sections in all kinds of cultural palaces, clubs, libraries, stadiums and parks. Every summer, trade unions, the Ministry of Education and the Youth League organize various summer activities for children, so that all children can have a meaningful and happy summer vacation. For children suffering from mild lung diseases, there are also forest schools, where they can recuperate while studying.

    Stalin's idea of caring for children and attaching importance to communist education for children was not only implemented in the work of the government, but also influenced the broad masses of the Soviet people, was grasped by the broad masses of the Soviet people, and became a material force. The Soviet people consciously believed that caring for and educating children was their most glorious duty. When we visited the Soviet Union, we met many teachers, whether young or old, who were so passionate and loyal to the work entrusted to them by the motherland, and constantly pursued higher quality of work. In the school named after Zoya, we met an old white-haired teacher with a shining Order of Lenin on her chest. Although she had long reached the age of retirement stipulated by the government and received a pension sufficient for her living, she insisted on not leaving her post. She excitedly told us: You must know how much I love my country! A person who loves his country cannot leave his work for a moment; I am very proud that the country trusts me so much and gives me the glorious task of cultivating a new generation. Many teachers we met were as touching as this old teacher. They educated children with all their energy, and they set an example for children with their noble communist qualities. They expect the young people they educate to be better than each other. The reason for this is that Stalin always closely linked caring for children with caring for teachers and improving the quality of teachers. Stalin said: "The ranks of people's teachers are an indispensable part of the great contingent of workers in our country who are building a new life on a socialist basis." At the same time, Stalin instructed the Party and the Youth League to strengthen their work in schools, and required teachers to constantly improve their Marxist-Leninist level and improve the quality of teaching. In addition, Stalin and the Soviet government gave extremely high evaluations to the work of teachers. In order to thank the teachers for their great contributions, the Soviet government awarded certificates and medals to 100,000 teachers.

    The Soviet people also consciously undertake the task of cultivating a new generation. Most factories have established close ties with certain schools. They not only provide material assistance to the schools, but more importantly, they influence children with the excellent qualities of the working class, attract children to love labor, and cultivate children's qualities of dedicating themselves to the working people and the socialist motherland. Many professors and students of universities and colleges also consciously and automatically give various assistance to children. Many university students, normal school students, engineers, university professors, and various experts serve as Young Pioneer instructors or leaders of extracurricular children's groups, give reports to children, and so on. Professor Fiston Gors, an old professor of mathematics at Zhdanov University, automatically launched his colleagues and his students to organize a children's education committee, which regularly provides various assistance to various extracurricular children's institutions and Young Pioneer teams.

    The family also occupies a very important position in the cause of communist education for children. Stalin repeatedly taught Soviet parents to educate their children in the spirit of communism and responsibility to the collective. He once said to female workers and peasants: "Female workers and peasants, strive to implement these teachings of Ilyich! Educate your children in the spirit of these teachings." The Soviet Union does not allow children to perform well in school but perform poorly at home. Children's communist education must be carried out simultaneously in school and at home. When a child has bad habits, the teacher has the responsibility to invite his parents to the school to discuss how to educate him in school and at home and correct his shortcomings. The Party and the government also take an extremely serious attitude towards parents who are irresponsible for their children. In a factory in Izhevsk, the Party Committee Secretary of the factory, Abaimov, was removed from his post because his son had hooligan behavior, because his son's behavior showed that he was irresponsible to the collective and the country, and he no longer had the moral right to stay in this position.

    The Soviet people faithfully implement Stalinist care for children. In this regard, Stalin is their most glorious example. The children of the new Uda village in Siberia wrote a letter to Stalin reporting their learning situation. Because in the Tsarist era, Stalin was exiled to Siberia and lived in this village. Stalin personally replied to the children: "I am very moved by your respect. I wish you health and success in your studies and social work. I believe that you will successfully complete your studies and become energetic and knowledgeable workers, who are indispensable to our country." This letter gave great encouragement to Soviet children. Once, a woman named Anna Sulyok in Ukraine found that her three-year-old daughter was seriously ill and her life was in great danger, but she could not find an otolaryngologist in the small city where she lived. Anna Sulyok thought of her beloved leader Stalin and sent him a telegram. Three hours later, Anna Sulyok received a telegram from Stalin: "A specialist doctor has been sent to you. Please tell me about the treatment and the child's health." Then, Anna Sulyok received a telegram from Kyiv: "In accordance with the order of Comrade Stalin, an otolaryngology specialist has flown to you." This little girl was saved under the care of the leader.

    Now, although Stalin has unfortunately passed away, he will always live in the hearts of the people. "The sunshine of Stalin's life" will always shine on Soviet children, and the Soviet government and people will always care for children as Stalin did, cultivating children into new-type people with high cultural and scientific knowledge, strong physique, and high communist ideology and morality. Today, we are following the Soviet path. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the cause of cultivating and educating a new generation in our country, under the principle of serving the longest-term and greatest interests of our people, will also develop on an increasingly large scale with the development of economic construction and cultural construction. Our children also have infinitely bright prospects. We should learn from Stalin, learn from the Soviet people and teachers he taught the spirit of loving the new generation, and care for our children - the future of New China - in a Stalinist way.

    斯大林式的对儿童的关怀
    左林
    在斯大林的时代，苏联儿童成为人类有史以来最幸福的儿童。斯大林同志说：“我想，没有一个地方像在我们苏联那样，是这样关怀儿童，关怀他们的培养和成长的了。”对于苏联儿童的幸福生活，苏联人民也有一句充满了感情的话：“在斯大林的生命的阳光照耀下，苏联儿童的天才和才能，像美妙的花朵般开放着。”
    斯大林极为重视新一代的共产主义教育，他认为这是具有国家意义的政治任务之一。他曾指出：“……以无产阶级社会主义的精神来教育新的一代，是我党的当前首要任务，不实行这些任务，社会主义的胜利是不可能的。”斯大林这种对儿童共产主义教育的关注，是和列宁一样的。一九一九年五月，列宁曾指出：“儿童的组织——这是教育共产主义者的好办法。”随后，他们创建了世界上第一个少年先锋队，并且把这教育少先队员的崇高任务，交给了共产主义青年团。列宁逝世以后，少年先锋队员们曾在莫斯科举行了一次大检阅，他们向斯大林宣誓：要遵守列宁的遗训，继承列宁的事业。斯大林亲切地教导他们：儿童的主要任务是学习，要培养自己掌握各门知识的能力，使自己成为一个共产主义者。此后，斯大林和党并多次指示共产主义青年团加强少年先锋队的工作，要求少年先锋队的活动能正确地培养共产主义人材。
    斯大林对于儿童的关怀是无微不至的，他关怀儿童的生活，关怀儿童的教育，他甚至亲自参加编制儿童教科书的工作。十月社会主义革命以后，当苏联实行了新经济政策，并在社会主义国家工业化方面获得了重大成功的时候，斯大林立刻提出了实施初等义务教育。一九三○年，在联共（布）第十六次代表大会上，斯大林指出：“我们一向不得不‘到处节省，甚至节省学校’，以便‘拯救和恢复重工业’（列宁语），可是，近来我们已经恢复了重工业，并且继续前进。因此，我们着手组织普及初等义务教育的时候已经来到了。”自此以后，在斯大林的领导下，苏联便以日益巨大的规模，发展儿童的教育事业。在联共（布）第十七次代表大会上，斯大林讲到妇女问题时指出：“这个情况是有莫大意义的，同志们。其所以有莫大意义，是因为妇女占我国人口半数，是一支庞大的劳动军，而且她们负有使命来教育我们的儿童，我们的后辈，即我们的将来。”斯大林也非常重视师资的培养工作。在同一次党的代表大会上，他指出：“我所说的这个不可容许的现象，就是师范‘科’和医‘科’在我们这里至今尚被轻视。这是等于违背国家利益的一个大缺点。这个缺点是一定要铲除的。而且铲除得愈快愈好。”
    由于斯大林对儿童教育的重视，苏联培养和教育儿童的事业，得到了很大的发展。国家支出了数量巨大的教育经费；许多优秀的党员和团员参加了教育的行列。远在一九二二年，由于日丹诺夫的提议，在联共（布）第十一次代表大会上，决定把沙皇的一个宫，送给列宁格勒的少年们，作为少年宫。后来，又把沙皇贵族在克里米亚的一个宫，送给全苏联的少年们作少先营。一九四八年，斯大林还提出要给少年们建立更多的少年宫。从下面的事实，我们也可以看出，苏联为儿童做了如何巨大的工作：一九五○年至一九五一年的学年中，有二百二十五万个教职员在二十万所中小学校里，教育着三千七百五十万个中小学生。而革命前——一九一四年，全俄学生不过八百万人。此外，一九三三年至一九四八年，苏联作家为儿童写了一万三千种读物，印行了四亿○六百万册。一九五○年，只儿童教科书就出版了
    一亿多册。现在苏联的儿童从七岁起，便在学校里免费读到初中毕业。此外，还为儿童组织了一系列的校外儿童机关，这些校外儿童机关的任务是协助学校对儿童进行共产主义教育，帮助儿童加深、巩固和扩大在学校所学的知识，发展儿童的求知欲和学习兴趣。这种校外儿童机关——少年宫、少年技术家站、少年旅行家站、儿童图书馆、儿童剧院、儿童公园、儿童铁路、阿尔迪克少年疗养营等等，遍及全国各地，总共有二千多个。此外，在所有的各种文化宫、俱乐部、图书馆、体育场和公园里，还特别设有少年部。每年夏季，工会、教育部和青年团，都给儿童组织各种夏季活动，使所有的儿童都能过一个有意义的愉快的暑假。对于患轻微肺病的孩子，还办有森林学校，使他们一边休养，一边学习。
    斯大林的这种关怀儿童、重视儿童共产主义教育的思想，不但贯彻在政府的工作中，而且影响了广大的苏联人民，为广大的苏联人民所掌握，变成了一种物质力量。苏联人民都自觉地认为对儿童的关心和教育，是自己最光荣的义务。在我们访问苏联的时候，曾遇到许多教师，他们不论是年青的或年老的，总是那样热爱和忠实于祖国所交给自己的工作，并且不断地追求着更高的工作质量。在以卓娅命名的学校里，我们曾遇见一位胸前挂着闪闪发光的列宁勋章的白发老教师，虽然她早已到了政府所规定的该休息的年龄，领到的养老金也足够生活，可是她坚持着不愿离开自己的工作岗位。她激动地告诉我们说：你们要知道我是多么爱自己的国家啊！一个爱自己国家的人是一刻不能离开工作的；我很骄傲于国家这样地信任我，交给我这样光荣的培养新一代的任务。我们所遇到的许多教师，都和这位老教师一样使人感动。他们用自己的全部精力教育着儿童，他们以自己崇高的共产主义的品质在儿童中树立榜样。他们期望着教育出来的青年，一代比一代更优秀。其所以如此，是因为斯大林把对儿童的关怀和对教师的关怀，以及提高教师的质量，始终紧密地联系在一起。斯大林说：“人民教师的行列，是我国正在社会主义基础上建设新生活的劳动者的伟大队伍底必不可少的一部分。”同时，斯大林指示党和青年团要加强在学校的工作，并且要求教师们不断提高自己的马克思列宁主义水平，提高教学质量。此外，斯大林和苏联政府对教师们的工作给予了极高的估价，为了感谢教师们的巨大贡献，苏联政府曾颁给十万个教师以奖状和勋章。
    苏联的人民也自觉地担负着培养新一代的任务。大部分的工厂都和一定的学校建立了密切的联系，他们不但给学校以物质上的帮助，更重要的是以工人阶级的优秀品质去影响儿童，吸引儿童热爱劳动，培养儿童献身于劳动人民和社会主义祖国的品质。许多高等学校的教授和学生，也是自觉自动地给予儿童以各种帮助，许多大学生、师范生、工程师、大学教授和各种专家，都担任着少先队的辅导员，或是儿童课外小组的指导员，给儿童作报告等等。日丹诺夫大学教数学的老教授费斯顿哥尔斯，曾自动地发动他的同事和他的学生，组织了一个儿童教育委员会，经常给各种校外儿童机关和少先队以各种帮助。
    家庭在儿童共产主义教育事业中，也占着十分重要的地位。斯大林再三地教导苏联的父母要用共产主义的精神和对集体负责的精神去教育自己的子女。他曾对女工和农妇说：“女工和农妇们，你们努力执行伊里奇的这些遗训吧！你们按照这些遗训精神去教育你们的子女吧。”苏联是不容许儿童在学校里表现得很好，而在家庭里表现得很坏的。儿童的共产主义教育是要在学校和家庭同时进行的。当一个儿童有了坏的习惯时，教师有责任把他的父母请到学校里，商量如何在学校和家庭中对他进行教育，改正他的缺点。对于那些对子女不负责任的父母，党和政府的态度也极为严肃。在伊惹夫斯克市的
    一个工厂，该厂的党委书记阿巴依莫夫，由于他的儿子有流氓行为，而受到了撤职的处分，因为他儿子的行为说明他对集体、对国家的不负责任，他已经没有道德上的权利再留在这个岗位上了。
    苏联人民忠实地实行着斯大林式的对儿童的关怀。在这方面，斯大林是他们最光辉的榜样。西伯利亚新乌达村的孩子曾给斯大林写过一封信，报告他们的学习情况。因为在沙皇时代，斯大林被流放到西伯利亚时曾在这个村里住过。斯大林亲自给孩子们回了信：“我很为你们的敬意所感动。祝你们健康，学习和社会工作中的成功。我相信，你们会胜利地结束学业，并成为精力饱满的，学识渊博的工作者，这种人是我国不可缺少的。”这封信给苏联儿童以极大的鼓舞。有一次，乌克兰有一位名叫安娜·苏略克的妇女，由于她的三岁女儿病得很厉害，生命十分危险，而在她所住的小城里，又找不到耳科医生。安娜·苏略克想起了自己敬爱的领袖斯大林，拍了一个电报给他。三个钟头后，安娜·苏略克接到了斯大林拍来的回电：“已经给你派专科医生去了。请你把医治的情形和小孩的健康状况告诉我。”接着，安娜·苏略克又接到从基辅来的电报：“遵照斯大林同志的命令，一位耳科专门医生已经乘飞机到你那儿去了。”这位小女孩就在领袖的关怀下救活了。
    现在，斯大林虽然不幸逝世了，但他将永远活在人民心里。“斯大林的生命的阳光”将永远照耀着苏联儿童，苏联政府和人民将永远像斯大林一样地关怀着儿童，将儿童培养成为具有高度文化科学知识的、体格强健的、有着高度共产主义思想和道德的新型人物。今天，我们正走着苏联的道路，在毛主席领导下，我国培养和教育新一代的事业，在服从我国人民最长远最大的利益的原则下，随着经济建设和文化建设的发展，也将日益巨大地发展起来。在我国儿童面前，同样有着无限光明的前途。我们应该学习斯大林，学习他所教养的苏联人民和教师热爱新一代的精神，像斯大林式地关怀我们的儿童——新中国的未来。
