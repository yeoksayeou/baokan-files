In North China, as of March 31st, construction had officially commenced on 249,347 square meters of building projects, with an additional 670,000+ square meters scheduled to begin soon. To gain time and start more projects, construction administrative departments in various areas of North China have adopted many proactive measures. Construction units in Hebei and Shanxi provinces have universally established dedicated temporary offices or liaison groups. These groups specifically grasped the key issues of various construction units and assisted in resolving them, enabling many projects to begin ahead of schedule. For example, many construction units involved in projects spanning multiple years were unaware of the application procedures for commencing construction and allocating funds, causing projects that could have started to be delayed. Local construction departments helped them resolve these issues, enabling some of these multi-year projects to start on time. As another example, a certain project in Taiyuan City could not commence construction because there were insufficient bricks and lumber. The Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau's liaison group proactively assisted them in allocating materials, and construction began immediately.

Although many projects in the North China region have already commenced construction, and the problem of idleness has been alleviated to some extent, the majority of important projects have not yet begun, which is bound to affect the completion of the country's main construction tasks this year. Moreover, the projects that have started require a very short period, and the problem of idleness cannot be fundamentally resolved. Therefore, the North China Construction Engineering Bureau recently dispatched a group of inspection teams to Hebei, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Beijing, Tianjin, and other places to inspect the progress of the first phase of construction and the preparatory work for the second phase. They will assist the provinces and cities in resolving issues such as the construction capacity and design capacity of major projects, striving to achieve balanced and normal construction from the second phase onwards, and further resolve the problem of idleness.

    华北部分工程开工
    华北全区至三月三十一日止，已有二十四万九千三百四十七平方公尺建筑工程正式开工，即将开工的尚有六十七万余平方公尺。为了争取时间多开工，华北各地区建筑行政部门曾采取了许多积极措施。河北、山西两省各建筑工程单位曾普遍建立了专门的临时办公室或联络小组，他们具体掌握了各建筑单位的关键问题，并帮助解决，使许多工程提前开了工。如有许多跨年度工程的建筑单位不了解申请开工和拨款的手续，使本来可以开工的工程一直拖着没有开工，各地建筑工程部门即帮助他们解决了这些问题，使一部分跨年度工程及时开了工。再如太原市某工程因为砖和木料没有准备够，不能开工，山西省建筑工程局联络组便主动帮助他们调配了材料，马上就动了工。
    华北区许多工程虽已经开工，窝工问题也随之解决了一些，但是，重要的工程大部还没有开工，势必要影响今年国家主要建筑任务的完成；而且已经开工的工程需要的时间很短，窝工问题还不能根本解决。因此，华北建筑工程局最近又派出了一批检查组，分赴河北、山西、绥远、北京、天津等地检查第一期施工的情况和第二期施工工程的准备工作，协助各省、市解决主要工程的施工能力和设计能力等问题，争取从第二期开始均衡地正常地建设，进一步解决窝工问题。
