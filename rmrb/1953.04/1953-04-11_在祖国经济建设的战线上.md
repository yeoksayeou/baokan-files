    On the Front Lines of National Economic Construction
    To Anshan Steel!
    The people of the whole country are vigorously supporting the large-scale construction of Anshan. From January to now, more than 3,400 workers, 120 engineers, and 360 university and college students from all over the country have come to work at Anshan Iron and Steel Company.
    When the comrades from Anshan Steel who were recruiting workers arrived in Heishan County, Liaoxi Province, a factory in Shenyang had already arrived there to recruit workers. They took the initiative to let Anshan Steel recruit first. The Heishan County Government immediately convened a meeting to study recruitment methods and notified all district governments to actively assist. They went to the countryside day and night to mobilize workers scattered in the villages. Anshan Steel originally planned to recruit 250 skilled workers in Heishan County, but with the support of the people of Heishan County, it has recruited 415 skilled workers. Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces mobilized 2,000 Party members and Communist Youth League members from various counties to participate in the construction of Anshan Steel. In order to support Anshan Steel, Northeast Institute of Technology, Dalian Institute of Technology, Northeast Nonferrous Metal Industry Bureau, Shenyang Engineering Company, and other units transferred 120 university professors and engineers to Anshan. Universities and colleges in Fujian, Ganzhou, Guangxi, Jilin, Changchun, Benxi, and other places sent 360 of their best graduates to Anshan. The workers, engineers, and college students who support the construction of Anshan feel that it is a supreme honor to have the opportunity to participate in the industrial construction of the motherland's industrial base. Workers from Liaoxi Province said, "We are very honored to be able to dig a few shovels of soil for the construction of Anshan Steel." Another engineer said, "Seeing the amazing construction of Anshan Steel, I feel that the motherland is too great. I will work hard to realize the industrialization of our motherland as soon as possible."
    Supporting Capital Construction
    The industrial production, transportation, trade and other departments in Benxi and Fushun, Northeast China, have mobilized a large number of forces to actively support capital construction.
    After accepting the entrustment of the city's capital construction units, Benxi City Transportation Company immediately mobilized all cadres to carefully transport materials according to the contract. On the one hand, they organized the vehicles in the city, and on the other hand, they went deep into the countryside to recruit large vehicles to participate in transportation. Fushun Municipal State-owned Electrical and Mechanical Factory is working hard to manufacture cement mixers needed for capital construction. In order to ensure the quality of the machinery and deliver it on time, they have improved production management and strengthened the inspection system. As soon as the construction period arrives, they can send the cement mixers to the construction site. In order to reduce the cost of capital construction, Fushun Building Materials Factory has decided to produce red bricks near the construction site. Fushun Lumber Mill is studying ways to save rafter wood and will implement a material card system to ensure quality and timely supply. The trade and cooperation departments of the two cities are also actively preparing to serve the construction site. The Fushun Cooperative Union is preparing to establish eleven service stations at the construction site to supply workers with various consumer needs. The Native Products Company is purchasing various native products in large quantities to ensure that salesmen are sent to the construction site every day in the future to sell pork, mutton, beef, and fresh fish. They said, "Let the worker brothers of capital construction eat comfortably, so as to ensure the completion of the construction task." In order to help capital construction workers handle remittances, savings, and other matters, the Fushun Branch of the People's Bank of China is also preparing to set up an office at the construction site.
    Beijing Clothing Factory Creates Cotton Carding, Spreading and Quilting Combined Machine
    The staff and workers of Beijing Clothing Factory have collectively created a cotton carding, spreading, and quilting combined machine, which can increase production efficiency by more than sixteen times. This is a major production reform in the clothing industry.
    This cotton carding, spreading, and quilting combined machine completely combines the production processes of "opening," "carding," "spreading cotton," and "quilting cotton." The machine is equipped with a dust suction device, alarm, safety handbrake, and safety fire extinguishing pipe. According to preliminary statistics, using this machine to make cotton clothes and cotton trousers, 230 sets can be spread and quilted every day. In the past, when spreading by hand and quilting by machine, each person could only spread three sets per day, and each machine could quilt about eight to ten sets per day.
    The research and design of the cotton carding, spreading and quilting combined machine started in December last year, and the first machine was made on "March 8th" this year. Now, the factory's staff and workers are further testing and improving this machine for use in making winter clothes.

    Shorten the Baking Time After Overhaul of Open-Hearth Furnace
    The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant has promoted the Soviet advanced heating experience, which greatly shortens the baking time after the overhaul of the open-hearth furnace. If this advanced experience is promoted in all open-hearth furnaces in the plant, it can increase the country's steel production by more than 10,000 tons throughout the year. This experience is: according to the type of major, minor, and medium repairs of the open-hearth furnace, respectively determine the number of degrees the furnace temperature rises per hour in each stage of heating, and make a heating curve chart, which is operated by a special person. After Anshan Steelmaking Plant conscientiously implemented this new method, the No. 5 open-hearth furnace reached the temperature required for steelmaking within 28 hours after the furnace was repaired. The heating time after the furnace repair of another open-hearth furnace was further shortened to 20 hours and 37 minutes. Before the implementation of this advanced heating experience, it generally took 39 hours. Due to the shortening of the heating time after the open-hearth furnace is overhauled, the steelmaking time of the open-hearth furnace has greatly increased. Now the staff and workers of each open-hearth furnace in the plant are preparing to fully promote this advanced experience.
    Tuojiang River Basin Completes Sugarcane Field Planting
    The farmers planting sugarcane in the Tuojiang River Basin of Sichuan Province, one of the main sugar-producing areas in the country, have completed the planting of more than 260,000 mu of sugarcane fields. Now most of the sugarcane fields have revealed tender green seedlings.
    This year, many sugarcane fields in the Tuojiang River Basin have been planted with improved varieties. The sugar production of improved sugarcane varieties is up to 10% higher than that of local sugarcane varieties. During the planting period, in order to help farmers increase the yield per unit area, the local people's government issued six times more loans than last year, supplied farmers with 2,500 tons of chemical fertilizers through cooperative societies at all levels, and sent technicians to set up technical training stations to guide farmers in the use of chemical fertilizers.

    The First Workers' Residential City
    Cao Yang New Village in the western suburbs of Shanghai has recently built more than 4,000 households of workers' residences and many public buildings. Cao Yang New Village has now become the first workers' residential city in New China. This newly built workers' residential city, including the 1,002 households of workers' residences built last year, has a circumference of eight or nine li and can accommodate more than 30,000 people. In addition to more than 700 buildings, there are also middle and primary schools, kindergartens, nurseries, cultural centers, cinemas, sports fields, post offices, bathhouses, cooperatives, shops, banks, vegetable markets, health centers, and other buildings, with the characteristics of a general city. Each building in the city has a large open space around it, which can be planted with trees and flowers; the interior of the building is spacious, with plenty of sunshine and good air circulation. Nine hundred households of workers have now moved from slab houses or thatched huts to new homes. Some young workers have long wanted to get married, but they couldn't find a house anywhere in the past. This time, they have double happiness, and many people got married on the day of the move.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    到鞍钢去！
    全国人民大力支援鞍山的大规模建设。从一月份到现在，全国各地到鞍山钢铁公司参加工作的已有三千四百多名工人，一百二十名工程师，三百六十名大学和专科学校的学生。
    当鞍钢招聘工人的同志到了辽西省黑山县的时候，沈阳某工厂已先到该地招聘工人，他们主动地先让鞍钢招聘。黑山县政府也立即召开会议研究招工的办法，并通知各区政府积极帮助。他们不分昼夜地下乡对流散在乡村的工人作动员工作。鞍钢原计划在黑山县招收二百五十名技术工人，在黑山县人民的支援下，已招收到四百十五名技术工人。辽东、辽西两省从各县动员了两千名党员和青年团员来参加鞍钢的建设。东北工学院、大连工学院、东北有色金属工业管理局、沈阳工程公司等单位，为了支援鞍钢，抽调了大学教授、工程师等一百二十人来鞍山；福建、赣州、广西、吉林、长春、本溪等地的大学和专科学校把最优秀的毕业生三百六十人送到了鞍山。支援鞍山建设的工人、工程师、大学生，感到自己能有机会参加祖国工业化基地的工业建设，是一种无上的光荣。辽西省来的工人说：“我们能为建设鞍钢挖几锹土，也是非常荣幸的。”另一位工程师说：“看见了鞍钢的惊人建设，感觉祖国太伟大了，我要好好地工作，使我们祖国工业化早日实现。”
    支援基本建设
    东北本溪、抚顺两市的工业生产、运输、贸易等部门，动员了大批力量，积极支援基本建设。
    本溪市运输公司接受该市基本建设单位的委托后，立即动员全体干部认真按合同运输材料。他们一方面把市内的车辆组织起来，一方面又深入乡村，招雇大车参加运输。抚顺市地方国营机电厂正在紧张制作基本建设需用的水泥搅拌机，为保证机械质量和按时交货，他们改进了生产管理，加强了检查制度，只要工期一到，就可以把水泥搅拌机送到工地。抚顺市建筑器材厂为了降低基本建设成本，已决定在工地附近生产红砖。抚顺市制材厂正在研究拉椽木的节约办法，并将实行发材料卡片制，以保证质量和及时供应。两市的贸易合作部门，也都在积极准备为工地服务。抚顺市合作社联合社准备在工地成立十一个服务站，供应工人各种消费需要。土产公司正在大量购买各种土产，保证今后每天都派推销员到工地去推销猪、羊、牛肉和鲜鱼。他们说：“让基本建设的工人兄弟吃得舒舒服服的，好保证建设任务的完成。”为了帮助基本建设工人办理汇款、储蓄等事项，中国人民银行抚顺市分行并准备在工地设立办事处。
    北京被服厂创造弹花铺绗联合机
    北京被服厂职工集体创造了弹花铺绗联合机，生产效率可提高十六倍以上。这是被服业中一项重大的生产改革。
    这个弹花铺绗联合机把“开花”、“弹花”、“铺棉”、“绗棉”等生产过程完全结合在一起，机器上装有吸尘装置和警报机、安全手闸、安全灭火管。据初步统计，使用这个机器做棉衣、棉裤，每天可以铺绗二百三十套。而过去用手工铺，用机器绗时，每人每天只能铺三套，每台机器每天约绗八套到十套。
    弹花铺绗联合机从去年十二月开始研究设计，在今年“三八”节制成了第一台。现在全厂职工正进一步试验改进这个机器，以便在制作冬服时使用。

    缩短平炉检修后的烘炉时间
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂推行苏联先进的加热经验，大大缩短了平炉检修后的烘炉时间。这一先进经验如果在全厂各个平炉中推广，全年可为国家增产一万多吨钢。这个经验是：根据平炉大修、小修、中修的类别，分别决定加热时各阶段炉温每小时上升的度数，并做出加热曲线图表，由专人负责操作。鞍钢炼钢厂认真实行这个新的办法后，五号平炉修炉后在二十八小时内就达到了炼钢要求的温度。另一座平炉修炉后的加热时间更缩短到二十小时三十七分。在实行这一先进加热经验以前，一般需要三十九小时。由于平炉检修后加热的时间缩短，平炉的炼钢时间就大大增加了。现在该厂各平炉的职工正准备全面推广这一先进经验。
    沱江流域完成蔗田播种
    全国主要产糖区之一的四川省沱江流域，种甘蔗的农民已完成二十六万多亩蔗田的播种工作。现在大部蔗田已露出嫩绿的幼苗。
    今年沱江流域的许多蔗田都播种了良种。良种蔗的产糖量，最多的要比土蔗多百分之十。种植期间，当地人民政府为帮助农民提高单位面积产量，发放的贷款比去年增多六倍，通过各级合作社供应农民二千五百吨化学肥料，同时派出技术人员设立技术传授站，指导农民使用化学肥料。
