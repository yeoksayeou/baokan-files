Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th—Washington dispatch: After the Rosenberg couple filed a third appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Eisenhower administration's Justice Department submitted a document to the Supreme Court on the evening of the 2nd, requesting the rejection of the Rosenberg couple's appeal.

In its document, the Justice Department tried its best to conceal the U.S. judicial authorities' despicable behavior of framing innocent people with false witnesses. However, its so-called rebuttals to the various powerful reasons put forward by the Rosenberg couple in their appeal not only failed to prove the Rosenberg couple's "guilt" but also further exposed the U.S. judicial organs' barbarity, unreasonableness, and nature of framing good people.

For example, the Rosenberg couple pointed out in their appeal that Greenglass's confession—the only basis for the court's death sentence for the Rosenberg couple—was fabricated and self-contradictory, and was obviously concocted by the U.S. government in collusion with Greenglass. The U.S. Justice Department had to admit in its document that "more cooperation was possibly obtained from Greenglass and his wife after the interrogation (of the Greenglasses)," but it insisted that "this does not indicate that the U.S. prosecutor intentionally participated in making false statements," completely dismissing the reasons given by the Rosenberg couple.

The Rosenberg couple cited the opinions of famous scientists in their appeal, pointing out that people like Greenglass, who lack scientific knowledge, could not possibly draw diagrams of the atomic bomb from memory, as he claimed. The Justice Department could not refute this scientific conclusion but said that this "at most is a continuation of the attack on the credibility of the government witness."

The Rosenberg couple emphasized in their appeal that the main reason they requested the reversal of the original verdict was that they were innocent. The Justice Department did not offer any concrete and well-founded rebuttal to this point but said that "every major issue that the Rosenberg couple attempted to raise could have been raised in the original trial or appeal process," and therefore should not be retried. Everyone remembers that the U.S. judicial authorities repeatedly rejected the Rosenberg couple's request for a retrial because they feared the exposure of the frame-up conspiracy.

    美政府害怕诬陷阴谋败露
    图谋拒绝罗森堡夫妇的上诉
    【新华社七日讯】华盛顿消息：在罗森堡夫妇向美国最高法院提出第三次上诉以后，艾森豪威尔政府的司法部在二日晚上给了最高法院一个公文，要求拒绝罗森堡夫妇的上诉。
    司法部在它的公文里竭力掩饰美国司法当局以假证人陷害无辜的卑劣行为，但是它对罗森堡夫妇在上诉书中提出的各项有力的理由所作的所谓反驳，不但不能证明罗森堡夫妇“有罪”，反而更加暴露出美国司法机关的蛮横无理、陷害好人的本色。
    例如，罗森堡夫妇在上诉书中指出格林格拉斯的供词——法院判罗森堡夫妇死刑的唯一根据——是假造的，而且先后矛盾，显然是美国政府串通格林格拉斯编造的。美国司法部在它的公文中也不得不承认“可能在传讯（格林格拉斯夫妇）后从格林格拉斯和他的妻子那里得到了更多的合作”，但它却又硬说“这并不说明美国检察官有意地参预作假”，而把罗森堡夫妇举出的理由完全推在一边。
    罗森堡夫妇在上诉书中引了著名的科学家的意见，指出像格林格拉斯那样缺乏科学知识的人，根本不可能像他自己所说那样凭记忆画出什么原子弹的图样给罗森堡。司法部无法反驳这一科学的结论，却说，这“至多不过是继续攻击政府见证人的可信性”。
    罗森堡夫妇在上诉书中强调，他们要求撤销原判的主要理由是他们是无罪的。司法部对于这一点没有提出任何切实有据的反驳，却说罗森堡夫妇所“设法提起的每一主要问题，在原审判或上诉过程中就能够提出”，因此不应重审。大家记得，美国司法当局因害怕陷害的阴谋败露，曾再三拒绝了罗森堡夫妇提出的重审要求。
