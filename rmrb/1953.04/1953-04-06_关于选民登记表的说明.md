Instructions on Voter Registration Forms

    I. Two formats are specified for voter registration forms, each with vertical and horizontal writing styles.
    The first type includes the following columns: Name, Gender, Age, and Ethnicity. It is intended for election areas or units that do not need to specify the voter's address.
    The second type adds an Address column and is intended for election areas or units that need to specify the voter's address.
    In rural towns and villages, the Address column is generally not included. Whether to add the Address column in urban areas is to be decided by the local election committee based on the actual circumstances.
    II. Ethnic minority areas may choose a format suitable for their written language and writing habits.
    The voter registration forms in ethnic minority areas should have the form's name and column headings translated into the local ethnic minority language and added to the form: for vertical formats, add it to the right of the Chinese text; for horizontal formats, add it above the Chinese text, i.e., in the position indicated by parentheses in the voter registration form format.
    III. In the Ethnicity column, ethnic minority areas should specify each ethnic minority group.
    In general election areas or units, only the ethnic minority voters within the area need to specify their respective ethnic group; other voters may omit this.
    IV. Voter registration forms are generally printed by the election committee at the level above the basic election unit, and registration is handled by the basic election committee. For example: voter registration forms used by townships and towns are printed by the county election committee, and registration is handled by the township and town election committees; voter registration forms used by urban districts are printed by the municipal election committee, and registration is handled by the district election committee.
    Voter registration forms used by cities not divided into districts may be printed by their corresponding-level election committees.
    V. The general size of voter registration forms is specified as: 27 × 19 cm.
