    Reorganizing Production Management Structure by Referring to the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company Reduces Layers and Strengthens Centralized Management
    The state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company, with reference to the advanced enterprise management structure of the Soviet Union, has recently reorganized and adjusted the production management organization of its subordinate factories and mines. The new management structure after the reorganization reduces the number of levels, improves work efficiency, and can save the state 350 billion yuan in circulating funds.
    This time, the organizational restructuring of Anshan Iron and Steel Company transformed nineteen factories with continuous processes such as ore dressing, iron smelting, steelmaking, and primary rolling from factories that independently calculated profits and losses into workshops; the remaining non-continuous factories and mines, although still retaining a relatively complete accounting system, had their work such as purchasing materials or selling finished products uniformly managed by the company. After the organizational restructuring, twenty-eight material and accounting sections/divisions and other organizations at the factory level were abolished, and most of the planning, cost, finance, and technology work within the factories was placed under the direct management of the company. This reduction in layers reduces the numerous administrative procedures of "review, summary, and approval/transfer" of the past, strengthens the centralized management of this large comprehensive enterprise, and improves work efficiency. For example, in the past, it took at least three days for a workshop to go through nineteen departments to obtain materials. Now, only three procedures are required, and the materials are delivered directly to the workshop. The leading cadres of the factories and mines have also been freed from the past事務主義 (事務主義 - roughly translated as "routinism" or "administrative formalism") of being busy all day with stamping and signing official documents, and are able to go deep into the workshops to understand and solve problems in production in a timely manner.
    In the past, each factory and mine independently calculated profits and losses, and the allocation of materials between factories and mines and the company belonged to commercial relationships, so the circulating funds of the entire company were very large. After the organizational restructuring, the company's total production plan value for this year increased by 27.29% compared to last year, but the planned amount of circulating funds was reduced by 350 billion yuan compared to last year.

    参照苏联先进经验改组生产管理机构
    鞍山钢铁公司减少层次加强集中管理
    国营鞍山钢铁公司参照苏联先进的企业管理机构，最近改组和调整了所属各厂、矿的生产管理组织。改组后的新的管理机构，层次减少，工作效率提高，并且可以为国家节省三千五百亿元的流动资金。
    鞍山钢铁公司这次机构改组是把选矿、炼铁、炼钢、初轧等连续性的十九个厂，从独立计算盈亏的厂改为车间性质的厂；其余非连续性的厂、矿，虽然仍保留着比较完整的会计制度，但对外采购物资或推销成品等工作，都划归公司统一管理。机构改组后，取消了厂一级的二十八个材料、会计科、股和其它组织，大部分厂内的计划、成本、财务、技术等工作划归公司直接管理。这样减少了层次，就减少了过去繁多的“审核、汇综、批转”的行政手续，加强了这个庞大的综合性企业的集中管理，使工作效率提高。如过去车间里领材料要经过十九个部门，至少用三天时间。现在只要办三道手续，材料就直接送到车间了。厂、矿的领导干部，也摆脱了过去天天忙于盖章签署公文的事务主义，能够深入车间及时了解和解决生产中的问题。
    过去各厂矿独立计算盈亏，各厂矿之间和公司之间的物资调拨等都是属于商业关系，所以全公司流动资金很大。机构改组后，公司今年生产计划总值比去年增加了百分之二十七点二九，但流动资金的计划额却比去年节省三千五百亿元。（新华社）
