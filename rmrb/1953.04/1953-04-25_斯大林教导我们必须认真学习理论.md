　　Stalin Teaches Us We Must Seriously Study Theory
    Hu Sheng
    The study of Stalin's great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the CPSU has sparked a widespread upsurge in theoretical study within the Chinese Communist Party's cadre. The issuance and implementation of the Party Central Committee's "Instruction on Cadre Theoretical Education for 1953-1954" will undoubtedly bring about significant improvements in the state of the Party's theoretical study.
    It should be pointed out that, within our Party, not every Party member, and even not every cadre, understands the importance of studying theory. Regrettably, there are still many comrades who do not recognize the great significance of Marxist theory for our revolutionary practice. Judging not by words but by actions, it can be said that these comrades have simply turned a deaf ear to the countless instructions of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on the role of theory, and have simply turned a deaf ear to the countless instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee on studying Marxist-Leninist theory.
    In order to raise the Party's theoretical study to the level it should be, it is necessary to review the great Stalin's teachings on theoretical study.
     ×                        ×                        ×
    In an essay written for Lenin's 50th birthday, Stalin said: "To maintain one's qualifications as a leader of the proletarian revolution and the proletarian party, one must possess both strong theoretical power and practical organizational work experience in the proletarian movement." (See "Lenin as the Organizer and Leader of the Russian Communist Party")
    Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, like Lenin, was a giant who possessed both far-sighted and powerful theoretical strength, and who was able to lead the masses bravely forward in the most severe storms.
    Ignorant fools once described Lenin and Leninism as if they only valued practice and did not care about theory. Stalin refuted this, saying: "This very strange view of Lenin and Leninism is completely incorrect and absolutely does not conform to the facts; the tendency of practical workers to ignore theory is completely contrary to the spirit of Leninism and contains a huge danger harmful to the cause." (See "Foundations of Leninism")
    In the treasure trove of works that Stalin left us, there are many places that discuss the great role of theory in the revolutionary cause, criticize various tendencies that do not value theory and deny the role of theory, and clarify the correct attitude to studying and researching Marxist-Leninist theory. These teachings of our great teacher Stalin are something that we Chinese Communists cannot forget for a moment.
    Stalin once explained the role of theory in such concise and clear words: "If theory is genuine theory, it can give practical workers the ability to determine the direction, understand the prospects, grasp the work, and have confidence in the victory of our cause. All of these have great significance in our socialist construction cause, and cannot but have great significance." (See "On Several Issues of Soviet Land Policy")
    Without relying on the power of theory, people cannot understand the various complex events surrounding us in the development of the revolution, cannot understand the significance of these events, their interrelationships, and their prospects for development. Only on the basis of a scientific understanding and prediction of objective social phenomena can we determine clear goals for the revolutionary movement and determine the firm line necessary to achieve these goals, and only then can we establish strong confidence in the revolutionary movement.
    Socialist construction is a complex and enormous project. It is Marxist-Leninist theory that can guide us to master this project. Some of our comrades, when agriculture in our country was still basically using old-fashioned simple tools and was still a scattered individual economy, attempted to use coercive methods to implement a planned economy in agriculture, and to implement so-called collective economy in a way similar to eating from a large pot. They thought that this would accelerate the socialist transformation of agriculture. But in reality, according to their approach, only the opposite result could be obtained. It seems that they are also working towards a beautiful goal, but their understanding of this goal and the methods they envision for achieving it are built on fantasy, on unreliable guesswork. If we lack a scientific understanding of Chinese society today and the road from today's society to socialism, this kind of mistake will occur.
    Of course, it is also wrong if we do not see that, thanks to the leadership of the working class, it is possible for peasants to move towards socialist collectivization through the path of mutual aid and cooperation, and if we do not actively and systematically lead the peasants towards this prospect.
    The Marxist-Leninist doctrine on social development enables us to discern the essence of all social phenomena using a profound method of class analysis. Stalin said: "Theory, and only theory, enables practice not only to understand how each class is moving and where it is moving at present, but also to understand how these classes will move and where they will move in the near future." (See "Problems of Leninism") Without this understanding, one cannot engage in the cause of building socialism.
    Some of our comrades think that we are "merely" executing the policies decided by the Party and advancing along the road prescribed by the Party, so even if we do not understand or do not understand theory very well ourselves, it will not hinder us from becoming "loyal workers." This idea is completely wrong and extremely harmful. We must never imagine our Party as if only a small number of people within the Party truly understand their Party's policies, while the other so-called "ordinary Party members" are just blindly following along. All of our Party's policies are understandable and must be understood by every cadre and every Party member. This is a manifestation of the justice of the working class's cause and a guarantee of the unity of thought and action of the entire Party. As Stalin pointed out, our Party certainly cannot allow our Party members to reach a point where, because they do not work hard to improve their political and theoretical level, they "no longer care about the prospects of our advance, no longer understand the correctness of our cause, and become some short-sighted, blindly and mechanically executing bureaucratic functionaries of superiors." (See "Concluding Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) at the Eighteenth Party Congress")
    Stalin said: "In any department of state work and Party work, the higher the political level and Marxist-Leninist awareness of the staff, the higher and more effective the work itself, and the more effective the results of the work; conversely, the lower the political level and Marxist-Leninist awareness of the staff, the more delays and failures in the work, and the more the staff themselves will become short-sighted petty people, degenerating into some bureaucratic functionaries who only seek immediate interests, and the more easily they will degenerate and change their nature -- this should be considered a theorem." (See ibid.) We should always take Stalin's words as a warning.
    Empiricists in practical work do not trust the guiding role of theory, they only trust their own one-sided experience, thinking that they can "explore" all the correct principles in accordance with Marxism from one-sided experience. Some people use their own one-sided experience to measure the significance of theory, and think that certain theories that seem to have some distance from their own one-sided experience are roundabout and useless things. Such an idea will also reach the same conclusion as the empiricists.
    Of course, experience is worth paying great attention to. But valuing experience does not mean that one can separate oneself from the guidance of theory. Moreover, what we value is not just one person's experience, one region's experience, or even just one nation's experience. The theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are a synthesis of the experiences of the world's workers' movement. True Marxists must sum up the experience of one person, one region, and one nation under the guidance of Marxist thought, and must engage in new work under the guidance of Marxist thought, obtain new experience, and analyze and study these experiences. Blindly "exploring" without the guidance of theory, although it is possible to reach certain individual correct principles, will inevitably take many detours and encounter many avoidable harms.
    Stalin once said: "If practical workers do not study Leninism, do not work hard to master Leninism, and are unwilling to combine their practical work with necessary theoretical training, then their fate will be groping in the dark." (See "The Tasks of the Communist Youth League")
    From this, it can be seen that we should use Marxism-Leninism to keep our minds clear and our eyes bright at all times, and not become blind people groping in the dark.
    Stalin's discussion of the objective nature of scientific laws in his great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the important role of theory.
    Scientific laws -- the laws of natural science and the laws of social science -- are reflections of objective processes that do not depend on people's will. People cannot transform, formulate, or abolish these laws, but can only discover, recognize, and study these laws. Once people understand these laws, they can use these laws to benefit society. Only by strictly observing and relying on objective laws can we "harness" these laws. "Any violation of the laws of nature, even the smallest violation, will only cause confusion and disruption of the procedure."
    The reason why Marxist-Leninist theory has great power is because it profoundly reveals objective laws.
    Stalin said: "The laws of political economy are objective laws reflecting the regularity of economic processes that do not depend on our will. Those who deny this principle are in fact denying science, and denying science is denying any possibility of prediction, and therefore denying the possibility of leading economic life."
    Stalin clearly pointed out the difference between scientific research and policy and the relationship between them, and this difference and relationship is not understood by some people who obliterate the role of theory in the name of practical work. Stalin said, in refuting Yaroshenko's erroneous opinion of reducing the issue of socialist political economy to the issue of "rational organization of productive forces" and "planning of the national economy": "Political economy studies the laws of development of people's relations of production, and economic policy draws practical conclusions from this, concretizes them, and builds its daily work on them. Piling the issues of economic policy on political economy is harming this science."
    From this, it can be seen that it is completely wrong if we only see economic policy and belittle political economy, that is, belittle the theoretical research on objective economic laws. The Party's policy tells us that things should be done this way and should not be done that way, that things can be done well by doing this way, and that things will be done badly by doing that way. But policy is not something that anyone arbitrarily creates out of thin air. Our Party's policy is based on objective laws and is guided by scientific research on objective laws. The reason why things must be done this way and cannot be done that way is because doing this way conforms to objective laws, while doing that way violates objective laws. The policy in this kind of work cannot be simply transferred to another kind of work, because this kind of work and that kind of work each have their own different characteristics.
    Therefore, only by relying on scientific theory that reveals objective laws can we comprehensively rather than one-sidedly, thoroughly rather than superficially understand policy. Conversely, if we do not understand theory and do not understand objective laws, we cannot truly understand the Party's policy, and we will unconsciously deviate from the Party's policy in practical work, or resemble the Party's policy in appearance but not in spirit.
    Denying the role of theory will make policy seem as if it is not based on any objective law, but is purely a subjective thing; it will lead our actions to the dangerous tendency of blind adventurism; it will also make us fall into the tragic situation of having no scientific foresight in practice and being unable to lead the advance of real life because we do not understand objective laws.
    In the conclusion of "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", Stalin taught: "The strength of Marxist-Leninist theory lies in its ability to enable the Party to discern the situation, understand the internal connections of surrounding events, and predict the course of events, not only to know how events are developing and where they are developing at present, but also to know how events will develop and where they will develop in the future."
    Stalin makes us understand that the working class party, if it is not proficient in Marxist-Leninist theory, cannot realize its role as the organizer and leader of the proletarian revolution.
    ×                          ×                       ×
    Theory is not to be underestimated because, and the underestimation of theory will form a huge danger even more because, if we do not arm ourselves with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, we will inevitably be captured by bourgeois ideology on this or that issue, captured by various reactionary ideologies.
    Stalin said in "Briefly on the Differences of Opinion within the Party": "In our era, there can only be two ideological systems, the socialist ideological system and the bourgeois ideological system. Wherever there is no former, the latter will inevitably appear and occupy the former's position." "The bourgeois ideological system is much older than the socialist ideological system, more widespread, and more deeply rooted in life; you can encounter bourgeois views everywhere, whether in your own or in a strange environment."
    The human brain is not a blank sheet of paper. When we cannot understand a certain issue with the proletarian position, viewpoint, and method, it is often not that we have no views and opinions on this issue; in this case, all of our views and opinions belong to the bourgeois ideological system.
    Countless facts can show that if we do not use the Marxist viewpoint to understand international affairs, we are following the bourgeois viewpoint on international affairs; if we do not use the Marxist viewpoint to understand our national life, we are secretly adopting the viewpoints of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie on various issues of our national life; even if we do not have a correct Marxist understanding of our Party and the Party's cause, we must be eroded by the ideas of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie.
    Stalin said in 1934: "We must never regard the Party as something isolated from the people around it. The Party lives and moves among the people surrounding it. It is no wonder that some bad emotions often enter the Party from the outside. As for our country having a garden to produce such emotions, there is no doubt about it, because there still exist some middle resident strata in our cities and villages, who are the source of these emotions." (See "Concluding Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) at the Seventeenth Party Congress") Stalin's words are, of course, completely suitable for the current situation in China.
    From this, it can be seen that if we do not work hard to accept a complete socialist ideological system, use complete Marxism-Leninism to arm our minds, then we are allowing bourgeois ideas and various non-proletarian ideas to leave a place in our minds, allowing these ideas to ferment and spread there, until they are completely dominated by them.
    Stalin joined Lenin in the struggle against spontaneity, thoroughly shattering this idea of ​​worshipping the spontaneous movement of the masses and denying the guiding role of theory. In the work "Briefly on the Differences of Opinion within the Party," Stalin resolutely defended the ideas in Lenin's work "What Is to Be Done?", and thoroughly elaborated on the important point that the workers' movement must be combined with scientific socialist ideas. Lenin and Stalin both emphasized that praising and worshipping the spontaneous movement without working hard to instill scientific socialist ideas into the working class would only result in the workers' movement being dominated by the bourgeois ideological system. This spontaneous workers' movement must go through a long period of wandering and pain before it can be isolated and linked to bourgeois ideas.
    Scientific socialist ideas cannot arise from the spontaneous workers' movement. Stalin pointed out: "To create scientific socialism, one must lead science, one must be armed with scientific knowledge and be good at studying the laws of historical development." Therefore, it is completely wrong for spontaneists to think that socialist ideas will arise from the spontaneous movement.
    Empiricism in practical work, in that it underestimates the guiding role of theory, in that it does not regard theory as being built on the basis of profound scientific research, is similar to the error of spontaneity.
    The greatest danger of various forms of empiricism and spontaneity to us is that it makes us resist necessary theoretical training, makes us not work hard to arm ourselves with a complete Marxist-Leninist ideological system, and thus makes us in a weak and incompetent position in the encirclement of bourgeois ideas and petty-bourgeois ideas, making us only succumb but not resist this aggression.
    The reason why not paying attention to improving the level of political theory has the danger of "degeneration and change of nature" is because of this reason.
    ×                          ×                          ×
    When emphasizing the importance of theory, of course we should not forget the dependent relationship of theory on practice and the need for theory to serve practice.
    Stalin said: "Scientific socialism without the workers' movement is just empty talk that is spoken out and dissipates with the wind." (See "Briefly on the Differences of Opinion within the Party")
    In "Problems of Leninism", Stalin said: "Theory is the comprehensive experience of the workers' movement in various countries. Of course, if theory is not linked to revolutionary practice, it will become theory without an object. Similarly, if practice is not guided by revolutionary theory, it will become blind practice."
    Marxist-Leninist theory was formed and developed in close connection with revolutionary practice. Therefore, this theory is full of criticality and combativeness, and must be constantly enriched and developed with the new experience of the revolution.
    Stalin said to the representative conference of Marxist land problem experts in 1927: "New practice produces new views on various issues of the transitional period economy. Now, issues of the new economic policy, class issues, construction speed issues, integration issues, and Party policy issues should all have new formulations. In order not to lag behind practice, we must immediately study all these issues according to the new environment. Otherwise, it will be impossible to break various bourgeois theories that blur the minds of our practical workers. Otherwise, it will be impossible to eradicate these theories that have become stubborn prejudices. Because only by fighting against bourgeois prejudices in theory can we consolidate the Marxist-Leninist position." ("On Several Issues of Soviet Land Policy")
    Stalin's words contain extremely important instructions.
    First, Marxist-Leninist theory is not developed "peacefully." People must oppose something in order to advocate something. People must fight against bourgeois prejudices in theory, fight against bourgeois theories that blur the minds of our practical workers, in order to make Marxist-Leninist theory grow.
    Second, we cannot isolate Marxist-Leninist theory from vivid practice that is constantly innovating. Theory cannot lag behind practice. Theory must answer new questions arising from practice, and must study various issues according to the new conditions that appear in real life. Only in this way can theory always maintain its active vitality and play a significant role in practice.
    Of course, we must also use this attitude to study Marxism.
    Stalin repeatedly taught us to treat theory with the correct attitude.
    Stalin said: "Some people may think that being proficient in Marxist-Leninist theory means carefully reading individual conclusions and individual principles in the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, learning to cite these conclusions and principles in a timely manner, and being content with this, hoping that the conclusions and principles that have been read thoroughly can be applied to any environment and to all practical situations. But this way of looking at Marxist-Leninist theory is completely incorrect. We must never regard Marxist-Leninist theory as a catechism, as a kind of creed, and regard Marxists themselves as pedantic and memorizing people." (See Conclusion to "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)")
    The dogmatic attitude cuts off the connection between theory and practice, and at the same time makes theory lose its criticality and combativeness. Theory becomes a lifeless and useless thing in the hands of dogmatists.
    Dogmatists believe that they are lying on an absolute formula that no longer requires any progress or development, and therefore regard all criticism and discussion as meaningless. Stifling criticism and discussion is stifling the development of Marxism.
    Stalin said in "On Marxism in Linguistics": "Without debates of different opinions, without free criticism, no science can develop, no progress is possible."
    In this Marxist classic work on linguistics, Stalin once again powerfully exposed the error of dogmatism. Stalin said: "In its development, Marxism cannot but be enriched by new experience and new knowledge -- and therefore its individual formulas and conclusions cannot but change with time, cannot but be replaced by new formulas and conclusions adapted to new historical tasks. Marxism does not recognize invariable conclusions and formulas that are absolutely adapted to all eras and periods. Marxism is the enemy of all dogmatism."
    The great Stalin closely linked theory and practice, creatively developed the theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin.
    ×                          ×                         ×
    The Chinese Communist Party is guided by the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.
    The Chinese Communist Party has always consistently adhered to using Marxism-Leninism to educate Party members and working people. Our Party regards raising its theoretical level as an important link in the Party's construction.
    Comrade Mao Zedong especially valued the development of Marxism by Lenin, Stalin, and the Soviet Communist Party, and especially valued the significance of studying the history of the Soviet Communist Party. In his speech "Reform Our Study" in 1941, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The study of Marxism-Leninism should also focus on materials centered on the 'A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'. 'A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)' is the highest synthesis and summary of the world communist movement in the past 100 years, and it is a typical example of the combination of theory and practice. There is only one completely typical example in the world. We see how Lenin and Stalin combined the universal truth of Marxism with the specific practice of the Soviet revolution and then developed Marxism, and we can know how we should work in China." After the victory of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly pointed out to the entire Party the need to learn from the Soviet Communist Party, "our best teacher."
    Comrade Mao Zedong combined the universal truths discovered and developed by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin with the practice of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong constantly educated the entire Party with the idea that theory must be combined with practice, and did not relax in the slightest in the struggle against the tendencies of dogmatism and empiricism.
    Learning Stalin's most valuable teachings, our task is to more widely and deeply publicize the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin in and outside our Party, and to overcome various tendencies of underestimating theory, denying the role of theory, and treating theoretical study with an attitude that is not necessary for scientific research.
    Our task is to conscientiously展开 theoretical criticism and self-criticism, and to conduct an irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois tendencies in theory and various anti-Marxist tendencies, and against the tendency to treat Marxism with a dogmatic attitude.
    Our task is to engage in huge organized efforts to overcome the serious phenomenon of theory lagging behind practice that still exists, and if we tolerate this phenomenon, it will obviously inevitably have a detrimental effect on practice.
    Stalin once said: "Our theoretical work should not only catch up with practical work, but also surpass practical work, arming our practical workers to strive for socialist victory." (See "On Several Issues of Soviet Land Policy") Stalin's instruction is our fighting goal on the theoretical front.

　　斯大林教导我们必须认真学习理论
    胡绳
    中国共产党全党干部对于斯大林的伟大著作《苏联社会主义经济问题》和马林科夫在苏共第十九次代表大会上的报告的学习，已经引起了党内理论学习的广泛的高涨。党中央“关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”的发布和执行，无疑将使党的理论学习的状况得到重大的改善。
    应当指出，在我们党内，直到现在，还不是每个党员乃至每个干部都了解学习理论的重要的。非常可惜，还有不少同志不认识马克思主义理论对于我们的革命实践的伟大意义。如果不是从口头上而是从行动上去判断，那么就可以说，这些同志对于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林关于理论的作用的无数指示简直是听而不闻，对于毛泽东同志和党中央关于学习马克思列宁主义理论的无数指示简直是听而不闻。
    为着把全党的理论学习提高到应有的水平，温习一下伟大的斯大林关于理论学习的教导是必要的。
     ×                        ×                        ×
    斯大林在为列宁五十寿辰而写的论文中说：“要保持自己为无产阶级革命和无产阶级党领袖的资格，就须一身兼备有雄厚的理论力量与无产阶级运动的实践组织工作经验。”（见“列宁是俄国共产党的组织者和领袖”）
    列宁事业的伟大继承人——斯大林，和列宁一样也是一个既具有高瞻远瞩的雄厚的理论力量，而又能够在最严重的风暴中领导群众勇敢前进的巨人。
    曾经有无知的妄人把列宁和列宁主义描写为好像是只重视实践而不关心理论。斯大林驳斥说：“对列宁及列宁主义所持的这种非常奇怪的见解，是完全不正确，而且是绝对不合于事实的；实际工作者忽视理论的趋势，是完全与列宁主义的精神相矛盾，而且包含着有害于事的巨大危险。”（见“列宁主义基础”）
    在斯大林遗留给我们的著作宝库中，有许多地方论述到理论对于革命事业的重大作用，批评了不重视理论和否认理论作用的各种倾向，阐明了学习和研究马克思列宁主义理论的正确态度。我们的伟大导师斯大林的这些教导是我们中国共产党人不能有一时一刻忘记的。
    斯大林曾以如此简洁明了的话来说明理论的作用：“理论如果是真正的理论，就能赋予实际工作者确定方针的能力，明白认识的前途，进行工作的把握，确信我们事业必胜的信念。凡此种种，在我们的社会主义建设事业中是有巨大意义的，而且是不能不有巨大意义的。”（见“论苏联土地政策的几个问题”）
    不依靠理论的力量，人们就不能理解在革命发展中环绕我们周围的各种复杂的事变，不能理解这些事变的意义，它们之间的相互关系和它们的发展前途。只有在对客观社会现象的科学的认识和预见的基础上，我们才能够为革命运动确定明确的目的，并确定为达到这目的所必要的坚定的路线，这样也才能够建立起对于革命运动的坚强的信心。
    社会主义建设事业是复杂的巨大的工程。能够指导我们掌握这个工程的就是马克思列宁主义的理论。我们的有些同志在现在我国的农业基本上还是使用旧式的简单的工具，还是分散的个体经济的时候，就企图用强制的办法来在农业中实行计划经济，用类似吃大锅饭的方式来实行所谓集体经济。他们以为这样就可以加速农业的社会主义化。但实际上，按照他们的做法，只能得到相反的结果。看起来，他们也是为着一个美好的目的而努力，但他们对这目的的认识和为达到这目的而设想的办法都是建筑在空想上，是建筑在毫不可靠的想当然的猜测上的。如果我们对于中国今天的社会和从今天的社会走向社会主义的道路缺乏科学的认识，就会发生这种错误。
    当然，如果看不到由于有了工人阶级的领导，农民就有可能经过互助合作的道路而走向社会主义集体化的前途，如果不去积极地有步骤地领导农民走向这个前途，也是错误的。
    马克思列宁主义关于社会发展的学说使得我们能够用深刻的阶级分析的方法来洞晓一切社会现象的本质。斯大林说：“理论，而且只有理论，才使实践不仅能了解各阶级在目前如何行进和向那里行进，而且能了解这些阶级在最近将来会如何行进和向那里行进。”（见《列宁主义问题》）没有这种认识，就不能来从事建设社会主义的事业。
    我们的有一些同志这样想，我们“不过”是执行党所决定了的方针，按照党所规定了的道路前进，因此我们自己不懂或不很懂理论，也无碍于我们成为“忠实的工作者”。这种想法是十分错误而极端有害的。决不能把我们的党设想成为只有党内一少部分人真正懂得自己的党的方针，而其他的所谓“普通党员”只是盲目地跟从着跑。我们的党的全部方针和政策对于每一个干部、每一个党员都是可以理解的，也是必须理解的。这是工人阶级的党的事业的正义性的表现，是全党在思想与行动上的一致性的保证。如同斯大林所指出，我们的党当然不能容许我们的党员由于不努力提高自己的政治水平和理论水平，弄到“不复关心我们向前进展的前途，不复了解我们事业的正确性，而变成一些茫无前途，盲目式和机械式执行上级指示的事务主义者”。（见《在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告》）
    斯大林说：“在国家工作和党工作任何一个部门中，工作人员的政治水准和马克思列宁主义觉悟程度愈高，工作本身也愈高、愈有成效，工作的结果也愈有效力；反过来说，工作人员的政治水准和马克思列宁主义觉悟程度愈低，工作中的延误和失败也愈多，工作人员本身也会愈加变为鼠目寸光的小人，堕落成为一些只图眼前利益的事务主义者，而他们也就愈易蜕化变节，——这要算是一个定理。”（见同上）斯大林的这段话是我们经常应该引以为戒的。
    在实际工作中的经验主义者不信任理论指导的作用，只信任自己片面的经验，以为从片面经验中就能“摸索”出一切合乎马克思主义的正确道理来。有的人用自己的片面经验来衡量理论的意义，对于某些看起来和自己的片面经验有若干距离的理论就以为是迂远的无用的东西。这样的想法也会走到和经验主义者同样的结论上去。
    当然，经验是值得十分重视的。但重视经验并不是认为可以脱离理论的指导。而且我们所重视的，不只是一个人的经验，一个地区的经验，甚至也不只是一个民族的经验。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论乃是全世界工人运动的经验的综合。真正的马克思主义者一定要在马克思主义的思想指导下总结一个人，一个地区，一个民族的经验，一定要在马克思主义的思想指导下从事新的工作，取得新的经验，并分析和研究这些经验。脱离理论的指导而盲目地“摸索”，虽然也有可能达到某些个别的正确的道理，但不可避免地会走许多弯路，遭遇许多可以避免的损害。
    斯大林曾这样说：“实际工作者如果不学习列宁主义，如果不努力掌握列宁主义，如果不愿意把自己的实际工作和必要的理论训练联系在一起，那他们的命运就会是暗中摸索。”（见《共产主义青年团的任务》）
    由此可见，我们在任何时候都应该用马克思列宁主义来使我们头脑清楚，眼睛明亮，而不去做暗中摸索的盲人。
    斯大林在他的伟大著作《苏联社会主义经济问题》中对于科学法则的客观性质的论述更使我们对于理论的重要作用获得深刻的认识。
    科学法则——自然科学的法则和社会科学的法则，都是不以人们的意志为转移的客观过程的反映。人们不能够改造、制定或废除这些法则，而只能发现、认识和研究这些法则。在人们一旦认识了这些法则之后，就能够利用这些法则来为社会谋福利。也只有严格地遵守和依靠客观法则，才能够“驾驭”这些法则。“对自然法则的任何违反，即使是极小的违反，都只会引起事情的混乱，引起程序的破坏。”
    马克思列宁主义的理论之所以有伟大的力量，就因为它深刻地揭发了客观的法则。
    斯大林说：“政治经济学的法则是反映不以我们的意志为转移的经济过程的规律性的客观法则。否认这个原理的人，事实上就是否认科学，而否认科学也就是否认任何预见的可能性，因而就是否认领导经济生活的可能性。”
    斯大林明确地指出了科学研究和政策的区别以及它们之间的关系，而这种区别和关系正是有些用实际工作的名义来抹煞理论的作用的人所不了解的。斯大林在驳斥雅罗申柯把社会主义政治经济学问题归结为“生产力合理组织”“国民经济计划化”的问题的错误意见时说：“政治经济学是研究人们生产关系发展的法则，经济政策是由此作出实际结论，把它们具体化，在这上面建立自己的日常工作。把经济政策的问题堆压在政治经济学上，就是戕害这门科学。”
    由此可见，如果我们只看到经济政策而轻视政治经济学，即轻视对客观经济法则的理论研究，是完全错误的。党的政策使我们知道事情应该这样办而不应该那样办，这样办才能办好，那样办就会办坏。但政策不是什么人任意地凭空地制造出来的。我们党的政策是建立在客观法则之上的，是由对客观法则的科学研究而引导出来的。事情之所以必须这样办而不能那样办，就因为这样办才合于客观的法则，而那样办就违反了客观法则。在这一种工作上的政策不能简单地移用到另一种工作上，就因为这一种工作和那一种工作各有它的不同的特点。
    因此，只有依靠揭露了客观法则的科学理论，我们才能够全面地而不是片面地，透彻地而不是浮浅地理解政策。反之，如果不懂得理论，不懂得客观法则，我们就不能真正懂得党的政策，就会在实际工作中不自觉地离开了党的政策，或者和党的政策貌似而神非。
    否认理论的作用，就会把政策看做好像不是依据什么客观法则，而纯粹是主观的东西；就会使我们的行动走向盲目冒进的危险倾向；也就会使得我们由于不理解客观法则而在实践中陷于没有科学的远见，不能领导现实生活前进的悲惨境地。
    在《联共（布）党史》的结束语中，斯大林教导说：“马克思列宁主义理论强有力的地方，就在于它使党能判明局势，能了解周围事变的内在联系，能预察事变的进程，不仅能察知事变在目前怎样发展和向何处发展，而且能察知事变在将来会怎样发展和向何处发展。”
    斯大林使我们懂得，工人阶级的党，如果不精通马克思列宁主义理论，就不能够实现其为无产阶级革命的组织者和领导者的作用。

    理论之所以不容轻视，轻视理论之所以会形成巨大危险，更因为，如果我们不用马克思列宁主义的理论武装自己，我们就不可避免地在这个问题或那个问题上为资产阶级思想所俘虏，为各种反动的思想所俘虏。
    斯大林在《略论党内的意见分歧》中说：“在我们的时代可能存在的只有两种思想体系，社会主义思想体系和资产阶级思想体系，凡是没有前者的地方，就一定出现后者，并且占领前者的地位。”“资产阶级思想体系比起社会主义思想体系来，要古老得多，流行更广泛得多，在生活中更根深蒂固得多；不论在自己的与陌生的环境中，到处你都可以碰到资产阶级的观点。”
    人的头脑并不是一张白纸。当我们不能用无产阶级的立场观点和方法来理解某一个问题时，常常并不是对这一问题没有任何自己的看法和意见；在这情形下，我们所有的看法和意见正是属于资产阶级的思想体系的。
    无数的事实可以表明，我们如果不是用马克思主义的观点来理解国际事务，就是追随着资产阶级对国际事务的观点；如果不是用马克思主义的观点来理解我们的国家生活，就是在我们的国家生活的各项问题上偷偷地采用了资产阶级及小资产阶级的观点；甚至如果对于我们的党和党的事业没有马克思主义的正确认识，那也一定是被资产阶级及小资产阶级的思想所侵蚀。
    斯大林在一九三四年说：“决不可把党看作与周围的人们隔绝的东西。党是在围绕着它的人们中间生存和动作的。无怪乎有一些不良的情绪往往由外界侵入到党内来。至于我国有产生这种情绪的园地，却是毫无疑义的，因为我们城市和乡村中至今都还存在有一些中间居民阶层，他们便是产生这种情绪的泉源。”（见《在第十七次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告》）斯大林的这节话对于中国现在的情况，当然更是完全适合的。
    由此可见，我们如果不是努力接受完整的社会主义思想体系，用完整的马克思列宁主义来武装我们的头脑，那就是听任我们的头脑中为资产阶级思想和各种非无产阶级思想留下地盘，听任这些思想在那里发酵、蔓延，以至完全为它所支配。
    斯大林曾和列宁在一起进行了对自发论的斗争，彻底地粉碎了这种崇拜群众自发运动而否认理论指导作用的思想。斯大林在《略论党内的意见分歧》这个著作中，坚决地捍卫列宁的著作“做什么”中的思想，把工人运动必须和科学的社会主义思想相结合的这一重要的论点作了透彻的发挥。列宁和斯大林都着重地指出，赞扬和崇拜自发运动，而不去努力把科学的社会主义思想灌输给工人阶级，结果就只能是让工人运动受资产阶级思想体系支配。这种自发的工人运动一定要经过长期的徘徊和痛苦之后才能和资产阶级思想隔绝联系。
    科学的社会主义思想是不可能从自发的工人运动中产生的。斯大林指出：“要创造科学的社会主义，就必须领导科学，就必须以科学知识武装起来并善于研究历史发展规律。”所以自发论者认为从自发运动中就会产生出社会主义思想来，是完全错误的。
    实际工作中的经验主义，就其轻视理论指导的作用这一点来说，就其不把理论看做是建筑在深刻的科学研究的基础这一点来说，和自发论的错误是相类似的。
    各种形式的经验主义和自发论对我们的最大危害性，就在于它使我们抗拒必要的理论训练，使我们不去努力用完整的马克思列宁主义思想体系把我们武装起来，从而就使我们在资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想的包围中处于软弱无能的地位，使我们只会屈从，而不能抵制这种侵袭。
    不注意提高政治理论水平之所以会有“蜕化变节”的危险，也就是因为这个缘故。

    在强调理论的重要性时，当然我们丝毫也不应该忘记理论对于实践的依赖关系和理论必须服务于实践。
    斯大林说：“没有工人运动的科学社会主义，就是一些冲口而出随风飘散的空话。”（见《略论党内的意见分歧》）
    在“列宁主义问题”中，斯大林说：“理论是世界各国工人运动的综合经验。当然，理论若不和革命实践联系起来，就会变成无对象的理论，同样，实践若不以革命理论为指南，就会变成盲目的实践。”
    马克思列宁主义的理论是在和革命实践密切联系中形成和发展起来的。所以这个理论是富于批判性和战斗性的，是要不断地以革命的新的经验来充实和发展的。
    斯大林在一九二七年向马克思主义土地问题专家代表会议说：“新的实践就产生出对于过渡时期经济各种问题的新的看法。现在，新经济政策问题，阶级问题，建设速度问题，结合问题，党的政策问题，都应有新的提法。为要不落后于实践，就须立刻根据新环境来研究这一切问题。如果不然，那就无法打破各种模糊我们实际工作者头脑的资产阶级理论。如果不然，那就无法铲除这些已变为顽固成见的理论。因为只有对理论中的资产阶级成见作斗争，才能巩固马克思列宁主义的阵地。”（《论苏联土地政策的几个问题》）
    斯大林的这段话中包含着极其重要的指示。
    第一，马克思列宁主义的理论不是“和平”地发展起来的。人们必须反对什么，才能主张什么。人们必须和理论中的资产阶级成见作斗争，和模糊我们实际工作者头脑的资产阶级理论作斗争，才能使马克思列宁主义理论生长起来。
    第二，不能把马克思列宁主义的理论和生动的、经常在推陈出新的实践隔绝开来。理论不能落后于实践。理论必须答复从实践中产生的新的问题，必须按照实际生活中新出现的条件来研究各种问题。只有这样，理论才能经常保持活跃的生命力，才能对实践起重大作用。
    我们当然也必须用这种态度来学习马克思主义。
    斯大林再三反复地教导我们要用正确的态度来对待理论。
    斯大林说：“有人也许以为精通马克思列宁主义理论就是用心读熟马克思、恩格斯、列宁著作中的个别结论和个别原理，学会及时引证这些结论和原理而以此自安，希望读熟的结论和原理能适用于任何环境，能适用于一切实际情形。但这样来看待马克思列宁主义理论是完全不正确的。决不可把马克思列宁主义理论看成是一部教理问答，看成是一种信仰条规，把马克思主义者本身看成是一些咬文嚼字和呆读死记的人。”（见《联共（布）党史》结束语）
    教条主义的态度割断了理论和实践的联系，同时也就使理论丧失了批判性和战斗性。理论在教条主义者的手里成为死气沉沉的无用的东西。
    教条主义者自以为躺在不再需要任何进步发展的一种绝对的公式上面，因此就把一切批评和讨论看做是毫无意义的事。扼杀批评和讨论也就是扼杀了马克思主义的发展。
    斯大林在“论马克思主义在语言学中的问题”中说：“如果没有不同意见的争论，没有自由的批评，任何科学都是不可能发展，不可能进步的。”
    在这部关于语言学问题的马克思主义经典著作中，斯大林再一次有力地揭发了教条主义的错误。斯大林说：“马克思主义在自己的发展中不能不以新的经验、新的知识而丰富起来，——因而它的个别公式和结论不能不随着时间而改变，不能不被适应于新的历史任务的新的公式和结论所代替。马克思主义不承认绝对适应于一切时代和时期的不变的结论和公式。马克思主义是一切教条主义的敌人。”
    伟大的斯大林就是密切地联系理论和实际，创造性地发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁的学说。

    中国共产党是以马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论为指导的。
    中国共产党从来一贯地坚持用马克思列宁主义来教育党员和劳动人民。我们的党把提高自己理论的水准看做是党的建设中的一个重要的环节。
    毛泽东同志特别重视列宁、斯大林和苏联共产党对于马克思主义的发展，特别重视学习苏联共产党历史的意义。毛泽东同志在一九四一年所作的“改造我们的学习”的演说中说：“研究马克思列宁主义，又应以‘苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本’为中心的材料。‘苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本’是一百年来全世界共产主义运动的最高的综合和总结，是理论和实际结合的典型，在全世界还只有这一个完全的典型。我们看列宁、斯大林他们是如何把马克思主义的普遍真理和苏联革命的具体实践互相结合又从而发展马克思主义的，就可以知道我们在中国是应该如何地工作了。”在中国革命胜利以后，毛泽东同志又再三向全党指出向“我们的最好的先生”苏联共产党学习的必要。
    毛泽东同志把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林所发现和发展了的普遍真理和中国革命的实践相结合。毛泽东同志不断地用理论必须和实践相结合的这种思想教育全党，丝毫也不放松地和教条主义及经验主义的倾向作斗争。
    学习斯大林的这些最可珍贵的教导，我们的任务就是，在我们的党内外，更广泛、更深入地宣传马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，克服各种轻视理论、否认理论的作用和不用为科学研究所必要的刻苦钻研的态度来对待理论学习的倾向。
    我们的任务就是，认真地展开理论上的批评和自我批评，和在理论中的资产阶级倾向以及各种反马克思主义的倾向，和用教条主义的态度来对待马克思主义的倾向进行不调和的斗争。
    我们的任务就是，从事巨大的有组织的努力来克服目前还存在着的理论落后于实践的严重现象，如果容忍这种现象，显然将不可避免地对实践发生危害的作用。
    斯大林曾说：“我们的理论工作不仅应当赶上实际工作，而且还要超过实际工作，武装我们的实际工作者去争取社会主义胜利。”（见“论苏联土地政策的几个问题”）斯大林的这个指示是我们在理论战线上的奋斗目标。
