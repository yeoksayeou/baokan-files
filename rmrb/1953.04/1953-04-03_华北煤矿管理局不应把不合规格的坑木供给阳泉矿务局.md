Reader's Letters Abstract

    Li Jiajun and Tang Haiqing write: The quality of pit props supplied by the North China Coal Mining Administration to the Yangquan Mining Bureau in the first quarter of this year was substandard. Some were too thick and too long, weighing up to 200 jin, unsuitable for underground use. Some were already rotten. Many birch trees were not debarked, making them prone to fire. This violates the principle of safe production and threatens the safety of underground workers. The No. 3 Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau suffered from substandard pit prop quality, hindering production progress and resulting in a daily reduction of 300 tons of coal output. Many workers were injured by the pit props. They said, "The pit props are no good; the supports collapse as soon as they are erected." Therefore, the Yangquan Mining Bureau has repeatedly submitted special reports to the North China Coal Mining Administration, requesting the cessation of bad materials and the supply of good materials to facilitate production. However, the Materials Supply Department of the North China Coal Mining Administration still allocated many substandard pit props to the Yangquan Mining Bureau in the second quarter. We urge the General Administration of Coal Mining and the Ministry of Fuel Industry to pay attention to this issue and take effective measures to resolve it quickly.

    华北煤矿管理局不应把不合规格的坑木供给阳泉矿务局
    李家骏、唐海清来信：华北煤矿管理局供给阳泉矿务局今年第一季度的坑木质量都不合规格，有的过粗过长，重量达二百斤，不合井下使用，有的已经腐烂；许多桦木不剥皮，容易着火。这样就违犯安全生产原则，威胁井下工人的安全。阳泉矿务局第三矿因坑木质量不合规格，妨碍生产进度，每日少出煤三百吨。许多工人被坑木压伤。他们说：“坑木不好使，棚子刚搭起扭头就塌了。”因此，阳泉矿务局曾先后专文呈报华北煤矿管理局，要求停发坏料，改发好料，以利生产。但华北煤矿管理局器材供应处第二季度依然分配给阳泉矿务局许多不合规格的坑木。我们要求煤矿管理总局、中央燃料工业部重视这个问题，迅速采取有效措施加以解决。
