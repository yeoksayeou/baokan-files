Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 19th: The UN General Assembly held a plenary session on the 18th, beginning discussions on the case passed by the Political Committee entitled "Impartial Investigation of Accusations Regarding the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by American Forces."

As previously reported, this proposal was put forward by the delegations of the United States and some other countries. The proposal stipulates the establishment of a committee to investigate accusations of bacteriological warfare by American troops in Korea and China, even though these accusations have been confirmed by authoritative international bodies. This proposal does not require all countries to participate in and ratify the Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons.

The proposal also presented estimated figures for the working expenses of the investigation committee to be provided by the UN Secretariat. According to the rules of the General Assembly, this estimated figure should first be discussed by the Fifth (Administrative and Budgetary) Committee of the UN General Assembly. However, the Chairman of the Fifth Committee, Romulo, suggested that the proposal be passed in the plenary session without the Fifth Committee first adopting this estimated figure.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, spoke against undermining the rules of the General Assembly in this way. He said: The Soviet delegation believes that the established rules must be respected. The Soviet delegation believes that if the UN General Assembly disregards the existing rules and passes a resolution without first listening to the Fifth Committee's opinion, the Soviet Union will not be bound by such a resolution.

Vyshinsky then explained the reasons why the Soviet delegation voted against the proposal of the United States and some other countries in the Political Committee. He said: The Soviet delegation believed in the past, and still believes now, that it is unnecessary to establish such a committee to investigate the aforementioned accusations, because the investigation work has already been conducted by impartial and authoritative international bodies.

During the discussion of this issue in the Political Committee, the Soviet delegation pointed out that it was absolutely abnormal and inadmissible to discuss this issue without the participation of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, which are directly related to the issue. If one party concerned participates in the discussion, justice and recognized principles of international law and the principles of the UN Charter require that the other party concerned also participate in the discussion. If one party concerned participates in the discussion and the other party does not, it is impossible to have a fair discussion on this issue. The reason why the Soviet delegation could not agree to discuss this issue in such an abnormal and illegal situation lies here. The Soviet delegation still believes that it is inappropriate and incorrect to establish a new committee to investigate facts that have already been accurately and fairly confirmed by the aforementioned authoritative international bodies.

In view of the above, the Soviet delegation voted against this proposal in the Political Committee and will also vote against this proposal in the plenary session. Naturally, the Soviet delegation cannot agree to the suggestion of providing working expenses to the investigation committee and opposes the establishment of such a committee.

Vyshinsky also pointed out that this proposal ignores an important issue—requiring those countries that have not yet joined or ratified the Geneva Protocol to join or ratify the Geneva Protocol. In our opinion, this is an important issue that must be resolved without delay.

Due to the Soviet delegation's opposition, the discussion on this proposal was temporarily suspended.

Next, the General Assembly unanimously adopted the proposal on the Korean issue put forward by the Political Committee. When explaining his vote, Polish representative Skrzeszewski said that because the negotiations on the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, held at the initiative of the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, were progressing smoothly, the Polish delegation did not insist that the Political Committee vote on the Polish proposal on the Korean issue. He said that the Polish delegation believes that it is also necessary to temporarily suspend the discussion of Poland's other suggestions in order to discuss these suggestions in detail at the appropriate time. Finally, Poland said that the Polish delegation supports the Brazilian proposal and hopes that this proposal can become the basis for resolving the entire Korean issue.

After expressing gratitude for the cooperation of the Polish delegation, representatives from Brazil, Peru, and India all hoped that this unanimously adopted proposal on the Korean issue could become an important step towards resolving the entire Korean issue and pave the way for removing obstacles to effective international cooperation.

Czechoslovak representative David said that the Czechoslovak delegation voted in favor of the Brazilian proposal, hoping that the bloodshed in Korea could end as soon as possible, and hoping that the entire Korean issue could be resolved justly.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, said when explaining his vote: The head of the People's Republic of Poland delegation has just announced here that the Polish delegation does not insist on a vote on the suggestions regarding the Korean issue and suggestions regarding other issues in the proposal submitted by Poland to the Political Committee for consideration. The Soviet delegation fully agrees with the decision and motives of the People's Republic of Poland. This is why the Soviet delegation voted in favor of the Brazilian proposal in the Political Committee and will vote in favor of this proposal in the General Assembly plenary session.

At the end of the meeting, the Chairman of the General Assembly, Pearson, said that he would immediately send the resolution unanimously passed by the General Assembly to all parties concerned and expressed the hope that the negotiations could end successfully as soon as possible.

### 联合国大会举行全体会议  一致通过关于朝鲜问题的巴西提案

    联合国大会举行全体会议
    一致通过关于朝鲜问题的巴西提案
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社纽约十九日讯：联合国大会十八日举行全体会议，开始讨论政治委员会所通过的名为“公正调查关于美国军队使用细菌武器的控诉”案。
    前已报道，这个提案是美国和一些其他国家的代表团提出的。提案规定设立一个委员会来调查对于美国军队在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的控诉，虽然这些控诉已经为权威的国际团体所证实了。这个提案并没有要求所有国家参加并批准禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。
    这个提案还提出了由联合国秘书处供给调查委员会的工作经费的估计数字。按照大会规则，这个估计数字应该先经联合国大会第五（行政与预算）委员会讨论。但是，第五委员会主席罗慕洛建议，不先由第五委员会通过这个估计数字就在全体会议通过这个提案。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发言反对这样来破坏大会规则。他说：苏联代表团认为必须尊重已经确立的规则。苏联代表团认为假如联合国大会不顾已有的规则，不事先听取第五委员会的意见就通过决议，苏联将不受这种决议的约束。
    维辛斯基接着解释苏联代表团在政治委员会投票反对美国及其他一些国家提案的理由。他说：苏联代表团过去认为，将来还是认为成立这样一个委员会来调查上述控诉是不必要的，因为调查工作已经由公正的、权威的国际团体进行过了。
    在政治委员会中讨论这个问题时，苏联代表团就曾经指出：没有与这一问题直接有关的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国代表参加，讨论这个问题是绝对不正常和不能容许的。假如一个有关方面参加了讨论，正义和公认的国际法准则和联合国宪章的原则就要求另一有关方面也参加讨论。假如一个有关方面参加讨论而另一有关方面不参加的话，要在这个问题上进行公正讨论是不可能的。苏联代表团所以不能同意在这样一个不正常的、非法的情况下讨论这个问题的原因就在这里。苏联代表团现在仍然认为成立一个新的委员会来调查已经为上述权威的国际团体所准确地、公正地证实的事实，是不适当而且不正确的。
    鉴于以上所述，苏联代表团曾在政治委员会投票反对这个提案，而且也将在全体会议上投票反对这个提案。自然，苏联代表团也不能同意给予调查委员会以工作经费的建议，而且反对成立这样一个委员会。
    维辛斯基并且指出：这个提案忽略了一个重要问题——要求那些尚未参加或批准日内瓦议定书的国家参加或批准日内瓦议定书。照我们的意见，这是一个必须毫不延迟地予以解决的重要问题。
    由于苏联代表团的反对，关于这个提案的讨论暂时停止。
    接着，大会一致通过了政治委员会提出的关于朝鲜问题的提案。波兰代表斯克热歇夫斯基在说明他的投票理由时说，由于在中华人民共和国政府与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府倡议下举行的交换病伤战俘谈判进行得很顺利，所以波兰代表团不坚持要求政治委员会对波兰提出的关于朝鲜问题的提案进行表决。他说，波兰代表团认为也必须暂时停止讨论波兰其他的建议，以便在适当的时候详细讨论这些建议。最后，波兰代表说，波兰代表团支持巴西提案，希望这个提案能成为解决整个朝鲜问题的基础。
    巴西、秘鲁与印度代表在表示感谢波兰代表团的合作后，都希望这个一致通过的关于朝鲜问题的提案，能成为导向解决整个朝鲜问题的一个重要的进展，并为扫除国际间有效合作的障碍铺平道路。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表戴维说，捷克斯洛伐克代表团投票赞成巴西提案，希望朝鲜流血能够尽快结束，并且希望整个朝鲜问题能够获得公正解决。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在说明他的投票理由时说：波兰人民共和国代表团团长刚才已在这里宣布，波兰代表团不坚持要求表决波兰提交政治委员会考虑的提案中关于朝鲜问题的建议以及关于其他问题的建议。苏联代表团完全赞成波兰人民共和国代表团的决定与波兰人民共和国的动机。这就是为什么苏联代表团在政治委员会上投票赞成巴西提案、并将在大会全体会议上投票赞成这个提案的理由。
    大会主席皮尔逊在会议结束时说，他将立即把大会一致通过的决议送交有关各方，并表示希望谈判能早日顺利结束。
