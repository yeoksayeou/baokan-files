The second year of afforestation work on the western shelterbelt of Northeast China has begun. This year's afforestation preparations have been relatively thorough. The Northeast Administrative Committee Forestry Bureau trained more than 500 afforestation cadres in advance. The provincial and most county governments in the shelterbelt area held meetings of forestry section chiefs and afforestation station directors; some arranged afforestation work through people's representative conferences at all levels. At present, nurseries in various places have fully prepared seeds and seedlings. In the past, farmers would not start planting trees until around "Grain Rain" (a solar term), but this year, in the southern regions of eastern and western Liaoning, farmers started afforestation before the Qingming Festival; in Heilongjiang Province, where the planting season is later, large-scale afforestation work will also begin in mid-April. On March 26, the Northeast Administrative Committee Forestry Bureau dispatched more than 30 cadres to Heilongjiang, Rehe, Jilin, and western Liaoning provinces to inspect afforestation preparation work in various places and provide afforestation technical guidance to farmers.

This year, the total area for constructing the western shelterbelt in Northeast China is 110,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare). Among them, a coastal defense forest stretching from the mouth of the Yalu River in eastern Liaoning Province to Shanhaiguan City in western Liaoning Province, with a total length of 1,583.4 kilometers and an area of 21,849.5 hectares, is planned to be completed in 1955, with a trial planting of 350 hectares this year.

In order to prepare conditions for future mechanized afforestation, the Northeast Administrative Committee Forestry Bureau has created a "Western Shelterbelt Mechanized Afforestation Experimental Station" in Kaitong County, Heilongjiang Province. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北区西部防护林带第二年度营造工作开始
    东北区西部防护林带第二年度的造林工作已经开始。今年的造林准备工作比较充分。事先东北行政委员会林业局训练了五百多名造林干部。林带区内各省和大部分县人民政府都召开了林业科长、造林站长会议；有的经过各级人民代表会议布置了造林工作。目前，各地苗圃已将树种、树苗准备齐全。以往农民都要到“谷雨”前后才开始植树，今年辽东、辽西的南部地区，农民们没有等到清明节就开始造林；种植季节较晚的黑龙江省，大规模的造林工作在四月中旬也要开始。三月二十六日东北行政委员会林业局已派出三十多名干部，到黑龙江、热河、吉林和辽西等省，检查各地造林准备工作，并对农民作造林技术指导。
    今年东北区营造西部防护林的总面积有十一万垧
    （每垧十五亩）。其中东起辽东省鸭绿江口、西到辽西省山海关市的一条海防林，全长达一千五百八十三点四公里，面积达二万一千八百四十九点五垧，计划预定于一九五五年完成，今年先试造三百五十垧。
    为给将来实行机械化造林准备条件，东北行政委员会林业局已在黑龙江省开通县创造了“西部防护林带机械造林试验站”。　（新华社）
