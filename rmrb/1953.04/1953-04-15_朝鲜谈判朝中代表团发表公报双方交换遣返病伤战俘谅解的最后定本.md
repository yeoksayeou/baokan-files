According to the letters from our commander to the opposing commander on March 28th and April 1st, and the letter from the opposing commander to our commander on March 31st, the two sides agreed that the reasonable resolution of the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war during hostilities should lead to the smooth resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue.

In this regard, General Li Sang-cho, the chief member of our liaison group, proposed at the meeting of liaison groups of both sides on April 11th that the armistice negotiation representatives of both sides should resume meetings immediately to discuss and resolve the entire prisoner of war issue and achieve a Korean armistice.

    朝鲜谈判朝中代表团发表公报双方交换遣返病伤战俘谅解的最后定本
    【新华社开城十四日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月十四日发表公报如下：
    继双方关于遣返病伤被俘人员的协定在四月十一日正式签字之后，双方关于遣返病伤被俘人员的行政细节的谅解，也已在双方联络组军官会议上取得完全协议。双方并在四月十四日正式交换了最后定本。至此，双方关于遣返病伤被俘人员的问题，经过双方会议上的协商讨论，已迅速取得合理解决。
    根据我方司令官三月二十八日和四月一日给对方司令官的信以及对方司令官三月三十一日给我方司令官的信，双方同意：在战事期间交换病伤被俘人员的问题的合理解决，应该使之引导到全部战俘问题的顺利解决，因之，双方联络组除安排病伤被俘人员的交换外，尚须商定双方停战谈判代表恢复谈判的日期。对此，我方联络组首席组员李相朝将军，在四月十一日双方联络组会议上，已提议双方停战谈判代表应即复会，以讨论和解决整个战俘问题，实现朝鲜停战。对方当时曾同意在一、二日内提出答复。
