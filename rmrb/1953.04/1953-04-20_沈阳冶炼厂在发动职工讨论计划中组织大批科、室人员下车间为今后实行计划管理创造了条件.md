The Shenyang Smelter, in the process of mobilizing workers to discuss plans, systematically organized more than 70 section and office personnel to go deep into the workshops to help workers formulate production plans. This also initially improved the business operations of various sections and offices, creating conditions for the implementation of planned management in the future.

Before organizing personnel from various sections and offices to go down to the workshops, some investigations and research were conducted. Therefore, they could clearly state what problems needed to be solved after going down to the workshops and made detailed action plans. For example, the Labor and Wages Section, after examining its own work and understanding the situation from the workshop workers, discovered that there were unreasonable phenomena in the piece-rate wages and reward methods in the zinc electrolysis workshop and the roasting furnace workshop of the smelting department, which greatly affected the workers' production enthusiasm. It was decided that improving the piece-rate wages and reward methods in these workshops would be the main task. The Finance Section focused on improving the management of working capital and strengthening workshop cost accounting; the Materials Section focused on establishing and improving the quota for the storage of consumable materials.

After the personnel from various sections and offices went down to the workshops, they worked under the unified leadership of the core group composed of responsible cadres from the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League of the workshop (some workshops also invited section and office heads to participate). The section and office personnel formed professional groups according to different business natures, such as plan review groups, technical improvement groups, labor and wage groups, etc. The core group frequently gained an in-depth understanding of the work of the professional groups and offered opinions and requirements. The core group of the smelting workshop was even able to meticulously point out the specific work objects and methods to each member of the professional groups.

Under such planned and organized mobilization and leadership, the personnel of various sections and offices were full of enthusiasm after going deep into the workshops and played a significant role in the discussion of the plan.

When the workers began to find shortcuts and tap potential, the technical personnel who went down to the workshops, together with the workshop technical personnel, guided the workers to concentrate their efforts on the key production issues and analyzed, synthesized, and improved the shortcuts proposed by the workers. This provided a basis for the formulation of advanced production plans. When the workers in the reverberatory furnace department discussed the plan, there was only one small reverberatory furnace. The large furnace was still under design and would not be completed until a month later. However, at that time, the cadres of the reverberatory furnace department took "striving for the production of one furnace of copper in 72 hours for the large furnace" as the goal of the workers' efforts. Because the workers had not seen the large furnace, they did not know how to find shortcuts. After the personnel of the Production Technology Section went to the reverberatory furnace department, they discovered this situation. After consultation with the workshop cadres, they changed the slogan to: "Shorten the production time of the small furnace and save electricity and oil!" to guide the workers to solve the key issues in the current production. After discussion, due to the improvement of the operation method, the consumption of electricity and oil per ton of copper was reduced from the original 350 kilograms to 270 kilograms, which was 10 kilograms lower than the original quota, and the production time was also saved. Now that the large furnace has been built, the workers have applied the new operating methods used on the small furnace to the production of the large furnace, and the large furnace has smoothly achieved the goal of producing one furnace of copper in 72 hours. In mobilizing the masses to discuss the national plan, the workers proposed more than 1,300 shortcuts. Some of the shortcuts, after being synthesized and improved by the technical personnel, have become scientific operating methods. The technical personnel of the smelting department have synthesized more than 20 kinds of reasonable operating methods, such as uniform feeding and checking the furnace conditions, which reduced the copper content in the slag. The copper content in the slag was reduced from 0.9 percent of the blister copper to 0.85 percent, exceeding the national required target. The technicians of the lead electrolysis department have synthesized a rapid casting method, and the output of anode plates has increased from 700 pieces per day to 1,000 pieces, improving the utilization rate of the lead melting pot equipment.

At the same time, through going deep into the workshops, problems existing in some workshops in terms of original records, labor organization, wages, and reward systems were initially discovered and resolved. Wang Lianru, a cost accountant of the Finance Section, helped the zinc electrolysis workshop improve the original records after arriving at the workshop. For example, the limestone (quota material) used in the workshop was previously considered very cheap by the workers. They did not weigh it when using it, and the recorders only estimated the consumption and recorded it on the original record sheet. Wang Lianru educated them by calculating the detailed accounts. The zinc electrolysis workshop was generally dissatisfied due to the unreasonable wage and reward system. Some workers disliked the low wages and wanted to go to other workshops. The labor organization in this workshop was chaotic, the division of labor was unclear, and the piece-rate wage system was not truly implemented. The rewards were given based on whether the entire workshop could complete the task. Whenever an accident occurred in one work section, or the quota was not completed, all the workers in the entire workshop could not get the reward. If these problems were not resolved, the workers would not be enthusiastic about discussing the plan and revising the quota. Therefore, the personnel of the Labor and Wages Section helped them reorganize the labor organization, conduct staffing, and helped them implement a reasonable piece-rate wage system and a segmented reward method.

After the section and office personnel went deep into the workshops, it was also convenient to listen to the workers' opinions on the work of the sections and offices and improve the work of the sections and offices. The Production Technology Section used to have many tasks. In addition to being responsible for production management, technical management, and operation planning, it also had to handle the workers' rationalization proposals and do design and construction work. The people in the section were busy all day long and did not know what the center was. Currently, the Production Technology Section has been divided into two sections: the Production Section and the Technical Section. The Technical Section is responsible for technical management, and the Production Section is responsible for production management. The Materials Section has established more than 200 kinds of material storage quotas through discussion of the plan. The Finance Section has established a specialized agency for managing working capital and formulated methods for managing working capital. New features have also emerged in the chemical analysis work of the Technical Inspection Section. In order to speed up the analysis of the grade of blister copper (the raw material of the converter workshop), the laboratory has developed a "furnace-front analysis" method, moving the analysis work to the workshop to ensure the actual recovery rate of metals. In the past, there was little contact between the various sections and offices. Because the scope of business was not very clear, some things were often shirked to each other. This time, the personnel of various sections and offices met in the workshop and exchanged opinions, which clarified the business scope of each section and office more than before and strengthened the contact. Now, many sections and offices have signed contact contracts.

    沈阳冶炼厂在发动职工讨论计划中组织大批科、室人员下车间为今后实行计划管理创造了条件
    沈阳冶炼厂在发动职工群众讨论计划中，有计划地组织了科、室人员七十余名深入车间，帮助职工制定生产计划，并且初步改进了各科、室的业务工作，为今后实行计划管理创造了条件。
    各科、室在组织人员下车间之前，就进行了一些调查研究，因此，能明确提出下车间后要解决什么问题，并作了周密的行动计划。如劳动工资科，经检查了自己的工作和向车间职工了解情况后，发现了锌电解车间和熔炼部焙烧炉车间，在计件工资和奖励方法上都存在着不合理的现象，对工人的生产情绪影响很大，便决定以改进这些车间的计件工资和奖励方法，为主要任务。财务科以改善流动资金管理方法、加强车间成本核算为主；材料科以建立、健全消耗材料储备定额为主。
    各科、室人员下车间后，是在车间党、政、工、团负责干部组成的核心小组统一领导下进行工作的
    （有些车间，还请科、室负责人参加）。科、室人员按业务性质不同，分别成立了专业小组，如计划审核组、技术改进组、劳动工资组等。核心小组经常深入了解专业小组的工作情况，和提出对他们的意见和要求。熔炼车间核心小组，还能细致地给每个专业小组的成员，指出具体的工作对象和方法。
    在这样有计划、有组织地发动和领导下，各科、室人员深入车间后，情绪饱满，在讨论计划中起了很大作用。
    当职工展开找窍门、挖潜力的时候，下车间的技术人员，便和车间技术人员一起引导职工集中在生产上的关键问题上动脑筋，并把职工提出的窍门加以分析、综合、提高，这就使制定先进的生产计划有了根据。反射部在职工讨论计划的时候，只有一个小的反射炉，大的炉还正在设计中，过一个月后才能建成，但是当时反射部的干部，就把“为大炉七十二小时生产一炉铜而奋斗”，作为工人奋斗的目标，工人因没见到大炉，不知怎样找窍门。生产技术科人员到反射部后，发现这情况，经和车间干部磋商后，便将口号改为：“缩短小炉的生产时间，节约电油！”以便引导工人解决当前生产上的关键问题。讨论后，因改进了操作方法，一吨铜由原用电油三五○公斤，减至用二七○公斤，比原定额降低了十公斤，也节约了生产时间。现在，大炉已经建成了，工人把在小炉上用的新操作法，运用到大炉生产上，大炉也就很顺利地达到了七十二小时生产一炉铜的目的。在发动群众讨论国家计划中，职工共提出窍门一千三百余件，有些窍门，经过技术人员综合，提高，成为科学的操作方法。在熔炼部的技术人员，综合出了均匀加料，检查炉况等二十多种合理的操作方法，减少了渣含铜，使渣含铜由占水铜的百分之零点九，降至百分之零点八五，超过了国家要求的指标。铅电解部技术员，综合出了快速铸型法，阳极板的产量由每天产七百片提高到产一千片，提高了熔铅锅设备的利用率。
    同时，通过深入车间，初步发现和解决了某些车间在原始纪录、劳动组织、工资和奖励制度等方面存在的问题。财务科成本会计员王连茹，到锌电解车间后，帮助车间健全了原始纪录。如该车间用的石灰石（定额材料），过去工人认为很贱，用时不过秤，记录员也仅凭估计把消耗量记在原始纪录表上。王连茹便用算细账的方法，教育了他们。锌电解车间因工资和奖励制度不合理，引起工人普遍不满，有的工人嫌工资低，要到旁的车间去。这个车间劳动组织混乱，分工不明，没有真正贯彻计件工资制。奖励是按全车间能否完成任务发奖的，每当有一工段发生事故，或完不成定额，全车间职工便都不能得奖。这些问题如得不到解决，工人讨论计划、修改定额也就没劲了。于是，劳动工资科人员，便帮助他们整理劳动组织，进行定员，帮助他们实行了合理的计件工资制和分段奖励法。
    科室人员深入车间后，也便于听取职工对科、室工作的意见，改进了科、室工作。生产技术科过去任务繁多，除了负责生产管理、技术管理、作业计划工作外，还要处理职工的合理化建议，做好设计、施工工作。科里人员整天东抓西拉，不知哪是中心。目前，已把生产技术科分为生产、技术两科，技术科负责技术管理，生产科负责生产管理。材料科通过讨论计划，建立了二百多种材料储备定额。财务科成立了管理流动资金的专门机构，制定了管理流动资金的方法。技术检查科的化验分析工作，也出现了新气象。化验室为加速水铜（真吹车间的原料）品位的分析，研究出了“炉前分析”的方法，把分析工作搬到车间进行，保证了金属实收率。各科、室相互之间，过去联系很少，因业务范围不很明确，有些事往往互相推诿。此次，各科、室人员在车间见了面，又交换了意见，对各科、室的业务范围较前明确了，又加强了联系。现在，已有不少科、室签订了联系合同。
