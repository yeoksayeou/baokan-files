　　Moving Towards Socialist Realist Theater Art
　　——Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Death of the Great Mentor of Theater Art, Nemirovich-Danchenko
　　Jiao Juyin
　　In the drama museum of the Moscow Art Theater, there is a small, yellowed business card on display. On the card are a few lines of small and delicate handwriting, with the name printed in italics in the middle—
　　Vladimir Ivanovich Nemirovich-Danchenko
　　This card, sent half a century ago, was to invite Stanislavsky to meet at the Slavyansky Bazaar restaurant. The meeting between Nemirovich-Danchenko and Stanislavsky on June 21, 1897, and their eighteen-hour conversation, led to the founding of the Moscow Art Theater on October 27 of the following year.
　　This conversation was of historical significance. It was not only the beginning of a new theater, but also the beginning of a new theatrical art. The birth of the Moscow Art Theater opened a new era in the history of Russian theater and provided an advanced model for the progressive drama and culture cause all over the world.
　　What force prompted Nemirovich-Danchenko to invite Stanislavsky, whom he had never met? What force inspired him to seek so eagerly and sincerely a figure with the same ideals, to jointly create a new theater? And what force supported him, giving him the courage to wage an irreconcilable struggle against a series of political, economic, and vulgar critical oppressions and ridicule in those difficult and reactionary years, until he laid the foundation for a new theatrical art?
　　This force was Nemirovich-Danchenko's love for his motherland, for the Russian people, and for the realistic and excellent traditions of the people's art. It was this love that made him unable to tolerate the situation in the Tsarist era that harmed the noble qualities of Russian theatrical art; it was this love that made him move forward bravely for a lofty ideal. His biographer, Yuri Sobolev, said: "His life's will was only towards one goal: to create the Art Theater." And what was the goal of creating the Art Theater? It was to establish realistic theatrical art, and for this, to establish a collectivist system of artistic creation. Therefore, when Russian dramatic art was facing collapse, he held high the banner of lofty artistic thought and carried out a righteous struggle.
　　All the achievements of the Moscow Art Theater are forever inseparable from the name of Nemirovich-Danchenko.
　　Nemirovich-Danchenko uncompromisingly expelled formalism and formulaic performance methods from this new theater. He put forward the profound theory that performance should start from real life, from the "inner experience" of the character's thoughts and feelings, and also put forward the correct opinion that the director must be an "organizer, educator, and mirror of the actors," and that the director, actors, and stage staff should jointly create "holistic" art, with the director as the central leader of the collective creation method. He embodied these concretely in the Art Theater.
　　In order to ensure the practice of this correct method, in addition to establishing a strict rehearsal and dress rehearsal system, he also put forward the principle that "administration should serve the performance," and formulated the administrative structure and working methods of the entire Art Theater on a democratic, collective, and practical basis.
　　He rejected literary works that were divorced from reality, and he made classical literary heritage re-evaluated in this new theater; he closely united the most outstanding and greatest contemporary writers around the theater, enriching the content of the new theatrical art. In order to accumulate new cultural heritage, he also established a "repertoire" system.
　　At the same time, he tirelessly educated young actors, established schools in the theater, and cultivated the next generation of artists with new education systems and courses. He always made the actors recognize their political tasks.
　　Just as he said in his speech when accepting the Order of Lenin in 1937, "The road is very clear before us—to embark on socialist realism, which requires profound artistry, and we must use the best systems accumulated by our theater over the years to accomplish all this." For all this, Nemirovich-Danchenko dedicated all his time and energy to the pursuit of socialist realist theatrical art with high artistry. He put in the greatest labor, even in the months before his death, this 84-year-old man still had to go to the theater every day to work for a few hours. His life was inspired by the passion of loving the motherland, loving the people, and loving the people's art, and he was constantly working.
　　Nemirovich-Danchenko was born in 1858 in a small town in the Caucasus. From his childhood, he developed a strong interest in acting. During his middle school and university years, he participated in various theatrical activities as an amateur actor. Subsequently, he started as a sharp drama critic, and then wrote novels and plays, which were loved by readers and audiences. He also worked in journalism, thus developing the ability to observe life keenly and deeply and analyze the psychological activities of characters. In 1891, he presided over the drama department of the Moscow Conservatory of Music. As a drama educator, he carried out bold reforms in teaching methods and curriculum content, and cultivated a group of students who later became the most outstanding actors in the Soviet Union. At the same time, with ideals and aspirations, with years of accumulated life experience and technical experience, he entered the theater and became an excellent director. In 1898, he and Stanislavsky jointly established the Moscow Art Theater. In 1919, he founded an opera house, applying the realistic creative method to opera, and opening up a new and broad path for opera. In 1923, he was awarded the title of People's Artist of the Soviet Russia (he and Stanislavsky were the first two Soviet artists to receive this glorious title). In 1936, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, and also awarded the title of People's Artist of the Soviet Union. In 1937, he was awarded the Order of Lenin. When the Great Patriotic War broke out, he led all the members of the theater to the city of Saratov to participate in the fight against fascist aggression. In his directed "The Kremlin Chimes," he created the images of Lenin and Stalin on the stage for the first time. In 1943, he won the first-class Stalin Prize. On April 25 of the same year, he died of illness in Moscow, and the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party (B) and the People's Committee issued an obituary to the whole country.
　　On the desk in the Moscow Art Theater Museum, there are still records written in his last few days. These were opinions recorded after he had just watched the rehearsal of Ostrovsky's play "The Last Sacrifice." He said: In the years of the Patriotic War, we must intensify all our creativity; and he believed that the Soviet people would surely win victory. This is equivalent to his last words to future generations.
　　The Soviet People's Committee made a decision to permanently commemorate him: to erect a monument in Moscow; to publish his literary works and works on stage art research; for the Moscow Art Theater to establish a drama school and research institute named after his surname; to build an opera house named after "Stanislavsky-Nemirovich-Danchenko"; to transfer his former residence to the Art Theater and establish a branch of the Drama Museum; and to issue funeral expenses and the support fees for his descendants for two generations.
　　From this decision, we can see how high the gratitude and respect the Soviet people have for Nemirovich-Danchenko! This is because his persistent and unremitting efforts throughout his life have indeed added a lot of glory and pride to the culture of the Soviet people, and his work has indeed played an indelible role in the theatrical art of the Soviet Union!
　　At the 20th anniversary celebration of the founding of the Moscow Art Theater, Stanislavsky said: "Nemirovich-Danchenko is the mother of the Art Theater,... and the mother's hard work is not easy to notice. ..." This sentence truly speaks of Nemirovich-Danchenko's noble qualities and great spirit. We know that he himself was also an excellent director, and he himself also had rich and developing performance theories. However, in order to make the people's art achieve greater success, he was willing to retreat to the post of administrative affairs, and put his strength in preparing more and better conditions for Stanislavsky as much as possible, so that he could complete that famous performance system. We also know that he himself was an excellent playwright. However, because Chekhov's "The Seagull" did not win an award, he refused the award for his own "Value of Life." In order to enable more excellent writers to create more for the people, he was willing to give up creative activities and concentrate on organization and unity work. Isn't this collectivist ideology and spirit of sacrificing personal interests for the overall interests of human culture the quality of the working class, isn't it the spirit of a great mother?
　　Our country's theatrical art has been infinitely influenced by Nemirovich-Danchenko in terms of anti-formalism and the establishment of a rational system. In particular, his classic work "Art, Drama, Life" (originally titled "Past Memories") has played a huge educational role among our theater organizers, directors, actors and stage staff. Our theaters in various places, not only in the organizational form, working system, and creative methods, are basically learned from the advanced and excellent examples established by Nemirovich-Danchenko, but even the names of the institutions mostly adopt the four characters of the Art Theater as an honor. However, what we have done in practice is far from enough. We must learn more from the Moscow Art Theater in order to competently participate in the cause of the motherland's cultural construction. When we commemorate the outstanding master who laid the cornerstone of socialist realist theatrical art, Nemirovich-Danchenko, we should first learn from him how to love the motherland, love the people, love the people's art, love labor, and especially we should learn from him: the collectivist ideology and spirit!

　　向社会主义现实主义剧场艺术前进
    ——纪念剧场艺术的伟大导师聂米洛维契—丹钦柯逝世十周年
    焦菊隐
    莫斯科艺术剧院的戏剧博物馆里，陈列着小小一张发了黄的名片，名片上有几行写得细小而精致的笔迹，中间是细斜体所印的名字——
    夫拉基米尔·伊瓦诺维契·聂米洛维契—丹钦柯
    这张名片，是远在半个世纪以前，送去约请史坦尼斯拉夫斯基到斯拉维扬斯基饭店会面的。聂米洛维契—丹钦柯和史坦尼斯拉夫斯基在一八九七年六月二十一日的相遇，和他们那一次长达十八小时的谈话，决定了次年十月二十七日莫斯科艺术剧院的成立。
    这次谈话是具有历史意义的。这不只是一个新剧场的开始，而且是一个新的剧场艺术的开始。莫斯科艺术剧院的诞生，给俄罗斯的剧场史开了一个新纪元，给全世界争取进步的戏剧文化事业，提供了一个先进的典范。
    是什么力量促使着聂米洛维契—丹钦柯去约请从未见过面的史坦尼斯拉夫斯基呢？是什么力量鼓舞着他那样热切地、恳挚地寻求一位具有同样理想的人物，为了共同创立一个新的剧场呢？又是什么力量支持着他，叫他在困难的反动的年月里，有勇气向一连串的政治的、经济的、和庸俗的批评界的压迫和讥笑，作不调和的斗争，一直到奠定了新的剧场艺术的基础呢？
    这个力量，就是聂米洛维契—丹钦柯对于祖国的热爱，对于俄罗斯人民、和人民艺术的现实主义的优秀传统的热爱。是这种热爱，使他对于沙皇时代那种残害俄罗斯剧场艺术的高贵特质的情况，丝毫不能容忍；是这种热爱，使他为了一个崇高的理想勇敢地前进。他的传记作者尤里·索包略夫说：“他一生的意志，只是向着一个目标前进：创办艺术剧院。”而创办艺术剧院的目标又是什么呢？那就是：要建立现实主义的剧场艺术，为了这个，又要建立集体主义的艺术创造制度。因此，他才在俄罗斯的戏剧艺术面临着崩溃的时候，高举起崇高的艺术思想的旗帜，进行正义的斗争。
    莫斯科艺术剧院的一切成就，是和聂米洛维契—丹钦柯的名字永远分不开的。
    聂米洛维契—丹钦柯毫不妥协地要把形式主义和公式化的演剧方法，逐出这个新剧场。他提出表演要从生活现实出发，要从“内心体验”角色的思想情感出发的深刻理论，又提出了导演必须同时是一个“组织者、教育者、和演员的镜子”的正确意见，和导演、演员、舞台工作人员要联合创造“整体的”艺术，而以导演为中心领导的集体创造方法。这些，他都在艺术剧院里具体地体现了。
    为了保证这种正确方法的实践，除了建立了严格的排演和彩排制度以外，他又提出了“行政要为演出服务”的原则，把整个艺术剧院的行政机构和工作方法，在民主的、集体的、实际的基础上制定出来。
    他拒绝脱离现实的文学作品，他使得古典文学遗产在这个新的剧场里得到新的估价；他把当代最出色最伟大的作家们紧紧团结在剧院的周围，丰富了新剧场艺术的内容。为了积累新的文化遗产，他又建立了“保留节目”的制度。
    他同时还毫不疲倦地教育青年演员，在剧院里成立了学校，以新的教育制度和课程，培养下一代的艺术家。他永远使演员们认清自己的政治任务。
    正如同他在一九三七年接受列宁勋章时在发言中所说的，“在我们面前，道路是很清楚的——要走上社会主义的现实主义，要求深刻的艺术性，就得运用我们剧院历年所积累下来的最优良的制度，来完成这一切。”聂米洛维契—丹钦柯，为了这一切，把一生全部的时间和精力，都贡献给了追求具有高度艺术性的社会主义现实主义的剧场艺术上。他付出了最大的劳动，就是到他临死的前几个月，这位八十四岁的老人，还每天必要到剧院去工作几个钟头。他的一生，都是被爱祖国、爱人民、爱人民艺术的热情所鼓舞着，在不停地劳动着的。
    聂米洛维契—丹钦柯于一八五八年出生在高加索的一个小镇子里。他从儿童时代，就对于演剧发生了浓厚的兴趣。中学和大学时代，他以业余演员的身份，参加过各种戏剧活动。随后，他以尖锐的戏剧批评家开始，进而写作小说和剧本，都受到读者和观众的爱好。他又从事过新闻报道，因而锻炼了敏锐而深入观察生活和分析人物心理活动的能力。一八九一年，他主持莫斯科音乐学校的戏剧系，作为一个戏剧教育家，在教学方法和课程内容上，进行了大胆的改革，培养出一批后来成为苏联最优秀的演员的学生。在这同时，他带着理想和热望，带着多年积累下来的生活经验和技术经验，走进了剧场，成为优秀的导演。一八九八年，他和史坦尼斯拉夫斯基共同建立了莫斯科艺术剧院。一九一九年，他又创立了一个歌剧院，把现实主义的创造方法，运用到歌剧里去，给歌剧开辟了一条新的广阔的道路。一九二三年，他获得苏俄人民艺术家的称号（他和史坦尼斯拉夫斯基是苏联艺术家当中最先获得此一光荣称号的两个人）。一九三六年，他获得劳动红旗勋章，又获得苏联人民艺术家的称号。一九三七年，他获得列宁勋章。伟大的卫国战争爆发，他率领着剧院全体人员，到沙拉托夫城，参加反法西斯侵略的战斗。在他所导演的“克里姆林宫的钟声”里，第一次在舞台上创造了列宁和斯大林的形象。一九四三年，他获得一等斯大林奖金，同年四月二十五日，在莫斯科病故，由苏联共产党（布）中央委员会和人民委员会讣告全国。
    莫斯科艺术剧院博物馆的书桌上，还摆着他生前最后几天所写的记录。那是在他刚刚看过奥斯特洛夫斯基的剧本《最后牺牲》的排演以后所记下的意见。他说：在卫国战争的岁月里，必须加紧发挥全部的创造力；他并且相信，苏联人民一定取得胜利。这等于是他留给后辈的遗言。
    苏联人民委员会，作出永久纪念他的决定：在莫斯科树立纪念碑；印行他的文学作品和有关舞台艺术研究的作品；由莫斯科艺术剧院设立以他的姓氏为命名的戏剧学校和研究所；建筑以“史坦尼斯拉夫斯基——聂米洛维契—丹钦柯”为名的歌剧院；把他的故居移交艺术剧院，成立戏剧博物馆分馆；颁发治丧费和他的子孙两代的抚养费。
    从这个决定上，我们可以看出，苏联人民对于聂米洛维契—丹钦柯，是具有多么崇高的感谢和敬意啊！这是因为他一生持久不倦的努力，确实给苏联人民的文化增添了不少的光荣和骄傲，他的工作，在苏联的剧场艺术上，也确实起了不能泯灭的作用啊！
    在莫斯科艺术剧院成立二十周年的纪念会上，史坦尼斯拉夫斯基说：“聂米洛维契—丹钦柯是艺术剧院的母亲，……而母亲的辛劳是不容易令人注意的。……”这句话，真实地说出了聂米洛维契—丹钦柯的高贵的品质和伟大的精神。我们知道，他自己也是一个优秀的导演，自己也有着丰富和发展的演剧理论。然而，他为了使人民的艺术获得更高的成就，竟情愿自己引退到行政事务的岗位，而把力量放在仅可能地为史坦尼斯拉夫斯基准备更多更好的条件上，使他去完成那个著名的演剧体系。我们也知道，他本人还是一个优秀的剧作家。然而，他为了契诃夫的“海鸥”没有得奖，就拒绝了颁给他自己的“生命的价值”的奖金，他为了使更优秀的作家更多地为人民创作，便情愿自己放弃创作活动，而专心致力于组织和团结的工作。这种为人类文化的整体利益而牺牲个人的利益的集体主义的思想和精神，难道不是工人阶级的品质，难道不是伟大的母亲般的精神吗？
    我国的剧场艺术，在反形式主义和建立合理化的制度方面，受到聂米洛维契—丹钦柯的无限的影响。特别是他的经典著作《文艺、戏剧、生活》（原名《往事回忆》），在我们的剧院组织者、导演、演员和舞台工作人员中间，起了巨大的教育作用。我们各地的剧院，不但在组织形式上，工作制度上，创造方法上，基本上都是从聂米洛维契—丹钦柯所建立起来的先进的卓越的范例上学得的，就连机构的名称，也多以采用艺术剧院四个字为光荣。然而，我们在实践上所做的，却远远不够。我们必须更多地向莫斯科艺术剧院学习，才能胜任地参加到祖国文化建设事业中去。在我们纪念奠定了社会主义现实主义剧场艺术基石的卓越大师、聂米洛维契—丹钦柯的时候，首先应该向他学习怎样热爱祖国，热爱人民，热爱人民的艺术，热爱劳动，特别应该向他学习的是：集体主义的思想和精神！    （附图片）
