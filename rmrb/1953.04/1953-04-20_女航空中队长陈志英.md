    Female Air Squadron Leader Chen Zhiying
    Zhou Zeming Xu Zhaoqun
    One fine and warm afternoon, we visited the first group of female aviation personnel of New China at an airport in the capital.
    On the spacious airfield, the female aviators were working intensely. Some were climbing beside engines, wiping and repairing the components; some were climbing on the tall nose of the aircraft installing propellers; communication officers were checking the radio in the cockpit; pilots were making meticulous pre-flight preparations. Most of them were young women around twenty years old. After arduous study and training, they had all become skilled at mastering the aircraft.
    People still clearly remember the glorious day of March 8, 1952, celebrating their "March 8th" take-off ceremony. At that time, they were just a group of aviation students who had just completed a glorious and arduous learning path, and they had only initially mastered aviation technologies such as flight, navigation, communication, and mechanics. It was also at this time that they transformed from students into female aviators and began flying in service of the country's aviation cause. In the past year, they have flown across almost the entire vast sky of the motherland. They have been to the subtropical south and the frigid border regions of northern China. During their voyages, some aircraft encountered the ravages of strong winds, while others encountered storms and heavy snow, but each time, they overcame the difficulties and successfully completed their missions.
    The squadron leader of this group of female aviators is Chen Zhiying, an outstanding female pilot who is now a representative attending the Second National Women's Congress of China.
    Chen Zhiying was born in a middle peasant family in the suburbs of Shanghai and is twenty-three years old this year. When she embarked on her first aviation mission after completing an arduous period of study, how excited she was! She thought: from now on, I am a formal pilot, and the long-awaited opportunity to serve the motherland has arrived. The aircraft advanced at a steady speed in the sunlight, and the vast land, cities, villages, and factories of the motherland came into view, flashing past under her fuselage. She couldn't help but feel a sense of honor and happiness, urging herself: For the motherland, I must do a good job!
    Before each flight, Chen Zhiying always made very careful preparations. She often prepared herself ideologically and technically for any unexpected situations that might be encountered in the air. She was calm and brave in the air, bold and meticulous. Once, she encountered clouds in the air, with large chunks of dark clouds and朵朵white clouds rolling towards her. The cloud layer was very low, and the dark clouds were particularly frightening. It was as if demons were trying to swallow the plane. She was a little scared at first, but then she thought: I can't panic, a good pilot should calmly handle all complex situations. At this time, she glanced at the instruments, plunged headlong into the dark clouds, and began flying through them. She smoothly passed through the dark clouds and entered the white clouds. The airflow in the white clouds was very strong. The first time she flew into the white clouds, the aircraft was hit by the airflow and dropped several meters in altitude. The second time, she calculated in advance the direction of the wind and the direction from which the airflow might come, made preparations for maneuvering, and finally successfully flew through the clouds and completed the flight mission.
    On another occasion, when Chen Zhiying was approaching the destination airspace and preparing to land, she looked down from the plane and saw that it was shortly after a snowfall, and the airport was covered in a blanket of white snow. After a long-distance flight, she encountered a snow landing, which required great care! A little carelessness, and the frozen airport could cause the plane to rush off the runway! Chen Zhiying concentrated all her energy, brought up the throttle, and landed safely with the most precise movements. The people at the airport didn't even know that she was a female pilot who had never flown a snow landing before!
    In April of last year, Chen Zhiying was promoted from an ordinary pilot to squadron leader. A high sense of responsibility towards the aviation cause made her particularly humble and cautious. She often consulted with leading comrades and conducted research with the entire team of air and ground crew before carrying out tasks and deciding on matters. She often said: The Party and the country have entrusted us with such an important task, and we must all do our best to do it well. In order to consolidate and improve the technical level of all personnel in the team, she often gave up flight time to allow other pilots to fly more. She herself flew less, but each flight had to be a step forward. This enabled the team's skills to be continuously improved and consolidated.
    Chen Zhiying loves the aviation cause and even more so cherishes the honor of the first group of female aviation personnel in New China. She is very concerned about the health of all personnel in the team. In the summer, she knew that the comrades liked to stay cool, so she often got up at eleven or twelve o'clock in the night to help everyone tuck in their quilts; sometimes she was afraid of falling asleep, so she simply stayed up late. She often said: Without a healthy body, it is impossible to persist in doing a good job in the aviation cause.
    Chen Zhiying enjoys high prestige among the flight personnel and ground crew. Everyone affectionately calls her: Our squadron leader! Under her leadership, her squadron received a collective merit for excellent performance in cultural studies. She and her squadron have excellently completed every task assigned by the higher authorities. Their efforts and deeds prove that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the women of New China are fully capable of mastering the most modern science. As Chen Zhiying said: "Relying on the cultivation of the Party, the women of our New China can master and utilize any complex modern science."
    Now, while Chen Zhiying is sitting in the venue of the Women's Congress, many people in her squadron are flying in the skies of the motherland; many people are working on airplanes. They all strongly expressed to us: To dedicate the most outstanding achievements to the great cause of aviation in the motherland. (Xinhua News Agency)

    女航空中队长陈志英
    周泽民  许钊群
    一个风和日暖的下午，我们在首都某机场访问了新中国第一批女航空人员。
    在宽阔的飞机场上，女航空员们正紧张地工作着。她们有的爬在发动机旁擦拭和修理机件；有的爬在高大的飞机头上安装螺旋桨；通讯员们在座舱里检查无线电；飞行员们在做着细致的飞行前的准备工作。她们大多是二十岁上下的姑娘。经过艰苦的学习和锻炼，她们已都是掌握飞机的能手了。
    人们还清楚地记得一九五二年三月八日庆祝她们“三八”起飞典礼的光辉日子。那时，她们还是一批刚走过了一段光荣而艰巨的学习道路的航空学员，她们只是初步掌握了飞行、领航、通讯、机械等航空技术。也就在这个时候，她们从一个学员变为一个女航空员，开始了为祖国航空事业服务的飞行。一年多来她们几乎飞遍了祖国广阔的天空。她们到过亚热带的南方，也到过祖国北部严寒的边疆。她们在航行中，有的飞机遇到过大风的侵袭，有的飞机遇到过暴雨和大雪，但是，每一次，她们都克服了困难，胜利地完成了任务。
    这一群女航空员的中队长，便是现在参加中国第二次全国妇女代表大会的代表、优秀的女飞行员陈志英。
    陈志英出身在上海郊区一个中农的家里，今年二十三岁。当她走过了一段艰苦的学习路程第一次执行航空任务时，她的心情是多么激动啊！她想：从此自己是一个正式的飞行员了，盼望很久的为祖国服务的机会来到了。飞机在阳光下以平稳的速度前进着，祖国辽阔的大地、城市、农村和工厂迎面而来，又从她的机身下闪过。她不觉产生了一种荣誉和幸福的感觉，鞭策自己：为了祖国，要好好地干啊！
    每次飞行之前，陈志英总是十分仔细地做着准备工作。她常常针对在空中可能遇到的意外情况，做好各种思想和技术上的准备。她在空中沉着而勇敢，胆大又心细。有一次她在空中遇到了云层，大块大块的乌云和朵朵白云向她卷来，云层很低，乌云尤其怕人。它就像一个个恶魔要把飞机吞下去似的。她开始有些怕，但又一想：不能慌，一个好的飞行员就应该沉着处理一切复杂的情况。这时，她瞅了一下仪表，迎头钻进乌云，开始了穿云飞行。她平稳地穿过了乌云，又进入白云。白云里的气流很大。她第一次钻进白云，飞机就被气流冲击得跌落了几公尺高度。第二次，她就预先计算着风向和气流可能袭来的方向，做好了操纵上的准备，终于胜利地穿过云层完成了飞行任务。
    又有一次，陈志英在到达目的地上空准备着陆时，从飞机上往下一看，这里是大雪初晴，机场铺上了一片白雪。长途飞行之后，又碰到了雪地着陆，需要多大的小心啊！稍一不慎，冰冻的机场就会使飞机冲出跑道外面去的！陈志英集中了全部精力，带起了油门，以最准确的动作安全着陆了。机场上的人们还不知道她是一位没有飞过雪地着陆的女飞行员呢！
    去年四月份，陈志英从一个普通的飞行员被提升为中队长，对航空事业高度的责任心，使她分外地谦虚和谨慎。她常常在执行任务和决定一件事情之前，请示上级领导同志并和全队空、地勤人员进行研究。她常说：党和国家把这样重要的任务交给我们，我们大家就要尽最大的努力来把它做好。为了巩固和提高全队人员的技术水平，她经常让出飞行时间给其他飞行员多飞。她自己则少飞，但飞一次要有一次的进步。这样使全队人员的技术不断地提高和巩固着。
    陈志英热爱航空事业，更热爱新中国第一批女航空人员的荣誉。她十分关心全队人员的健康。夏天的时候，她知道同志们爱贪凉，常常在深夜十一、二时起来帮助每个人把被子盖好；有时她怕睡着了，就干脆晚睡。她常常说：没有健康的身体，要坚持搞好航空事业是不可能的。
    陈志英在飞行人员和地勤人员中，享有很高的威信。大家都亲昵地称她：我们的中队长！在她的领导下，她的中队在文化学习中，因为成绩优良而立了集体功。她和她的中队一道出色地完成了上级所交给的每一次任务。她们的努力和事迹，证明了在毛主席和共产党领导下的新中国妇女是完全可以掌握最近代化的科学的。正如陈志英所说：“依靠党的培养，任何复杂的近代化科学，我们新中国的妇女都是可以掌握并发挥它的作用的。”
    现在，当陈志英坐在妇女代表大会会场上开会的时候，她的中队有许多人正飞行在祖国的空中；许多人正在飞机上工作着。她们都坚强地向我们表示：以最优越的成绩，供献给伟大祖国的航空事业。（新华社）
