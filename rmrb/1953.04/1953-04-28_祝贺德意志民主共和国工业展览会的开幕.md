Congratulating the Opening of the Industrial Exhibition of the German Democratic Republic
Shen Junru, Head of the Chinese People's Delegation to the Sino-German Friendship Month in 1951

    In June 1951, I was very honored to be elected as the head of the Chinese People's Delegation and went to the German Democratic Republic, the hometown of Marx and Engels, for the first time to participate in the grand "Sino-German Friendship Month" activities.
    During our month-long stay in Democratic Germany, we visited five states and more than sixty cities and rural areas. The Chinese delegation came into contact with more than 400,000 German people, including workers, farmers, scientists, doctors, artists, students, youth, and women. They expressed the warmest and most sincere welcome to the Chinese delegation. All the German people treated us very kindly, just like receiving long-lost brothers. I was moved to tears by the German people's profound friendship towards New China. Similarly, after the Chinese people gained liberation, they also expressed infinite admiration and love for Democratic Germany and the German people who are fighting for unification, peace, and democracy.
    This growing deep friendship between the Chinese and German people is completely understandable. Both the Chinese and German people are hardworking and intelligent nations with excellent cultural traditions. Both peoples love peace, democracy, independence, and freedom, and both have been and are constantly fighting for peaceful construction, creating a better new society, and improving the material and cultural lives of the people. The path, direction, and goals of the two peoples are completely the same. People's China and Democratic Germany are the two pillars of the powerful peace, democracy, and socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, in the East and the West, respectively. Therefore, the friendly cooperation between these two major powers in the East and West is in line with the interests of the Chinese and German people, as well as the interests of peace-loving people all over the world.
    After gaining national independence and democratic unification through a long period of struggle, the Chinese people express infinite sympathy and support for the German people's current struggle for unification, peace, democracy, and national independence. On the other hand, the advanced science and technology created by the German working people are urgently needed by the Chinese people, who are beginning large-scale construction and embarking on the road to industrialization. I remember that when I was in Democratic Germany, a German professor once said to me: "We German intellectuals must learn from the Chinese people's experience in revolutionary struggle, and the Chinese people can also absorb many valuable experiences from Germany's science and technology." This sentence fully illustrates the importance of friendly cooperation and cultural exchange between the Chinese and German people.
    Therefore, I sincerely congratulate the opening of the Industrial Exhibition of the German Democratic Republic in Beijing. This will be a new milestone in the cause of friendly cooperation between the Chinese and German people. This exhibition will not only have a demonstration effect on the industrial construction of New China, but will also make a great contribution to the close unity and cooperation between the working people of China and Germany.
    I believe that due to the growing strength of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp, and the increasing unity of peace-loving people all over the world, victory will always belong to the people. Just as the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, will achieve great victories in industrial and agricultural construction, the German people, under the leadership of President Wilhelm Pieck, will also achieve final victory in the struggle to establish a unified, peaceful, democratic, and independent Germany.
    Long live the great friendship between the Chinese and German people!
    Long live the victory of the worldwide peace, democracy, and socialist camp!

    祝贺德意志民主共和国工业展览会的开幕
    中国人民参加一九五一年德中友好月代表团团长  沈钧儒
    一九五一年六月，我十分荣幸地被推为中国人民代表团团长，第一次去马克思、恩格斯的故乡德意志民主共和国，参加了规模盛大的“德中友好月”活动。
    在民主德国，我们逗留了一个月，访问了五个州和六十余个城市和农村。中国代表团所接触的德国人民群众在四十万人以上。其中包括工人、农民、科学家、医师、文艺家、学生、青年和妇女。他们对中国代表团表示了最热烈、最诚挚的欢迎。所有德国人民都十分亲切地接待我们，正像接待从远道回来的亲兄弟一样。我被德国人民对新中国的这种深厚的友谊感动得流泪。同样地，中国人民获得解放以后，对于民主德国和正在为统一、和平、民主而斗争的德国人民也表示无限的崇敬和友爱。
    中德两国人民这种与日俱增的深厚友谊，是完全可以理解的。中德两国人民都是勤劳的智慧的民族，都有优秀的文化传统。两国人民都热爱和平、民主与独立自由，都曾经而且正在为了和平建设，缔造更美好的新社会，提高人民的物质文化生活而进行不断的斗争。两国人民前进的道路、方向、目标是完全相同的。人民中国和民主德国是以苏联为首的强大的和平、民主社会主义阵营的在东方和西方的两根支柱。因此这东西两大国的友好合作，是和中德人民的利益相符合的，也是和全世界爱好和平的人民的利益相符合的。
    中国人民于经过长期斗争获得民族独立和民主统一之后，对于德国人民目前所进行着的争取统一、和平、民主与民族独立的斗争，表示无限的同情与支持。另一方面，德国劳动人民所创造的先进的科学技术，又是为正在开始进行大规模建设走向工业化道路的中国人民所迫切需要学习的。记得在民主德国时，有一位德国教授曾经向我说过这样一句话：“我们德国的知识分子要向中国人民学习革命斗争的经验，中国人民也可以从德国的科学技术方面，吸收许多宝贵的经验。”这一句话充分说明了中德人民友好合作进行文化交流的重要性。
    因此我衷诚地祝贺在北京举行的德意志民主共和国工业展览会的开幕。这将是中德两国人民友好合作的事业中的一个新的里程碑。这次展览会不但对于新中国的工业建设，有观摩作用，而且对于中德两国劳动人民的紧密团结携手合作，也将有极大的贡献。
    我相信由于和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量的日益壮大，和全世界爱好和平的人民的日益团结，胜利将永远是属于人民的。正像中国人民在毛泽东主席领导之下，将会得到工农业建设的伟大胜利一样，德国人民在威廉·皮克总统的领导之下，在争取建立一个统一、和平、民主与独立的德国的斗争中，也一定要得到最后的胜利。
    中德两国人民的伟大的友谊万岁！
    全世界和平、民主、社会主义阵营的胜利万岁！
