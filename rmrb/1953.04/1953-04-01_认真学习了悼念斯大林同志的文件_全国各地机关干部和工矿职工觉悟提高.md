    Earnestly Studying Documents Commemorating Comrade Stalin
    Cadres in Government Offices and Workers in Factories and Mines Throughout the Country Enhance Their Awareness
    Cadres in government offices and workers in factories and mines throughout the country have basically concluded their study of the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin.
    During this study, the high degree of seriousness and consciousness displayed by cadres in government offices and workers in factories and mines throughout the country fully demonstrates how deeply the great image of Stalin is engraved in the hearts of the Chinese people. In addition to studying the documents commemorating Stalin, many people have also voluntarily read Stalin's works and books discussing Stalin. Many people have also established plans for regularly studying Stalin's works in the future. Cadres in first-level organizations in the Central South Region and in various organizations in Wuhan City have generally studied the documents stipulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China five to ten times in detail, and have all taken study notes. In Wuhan, many cadres, in addition to studying during the prescribed study time each morning, also voluntarily read Stalin's works during their rest time. In the Northeast first-level and Shenyang first-level organizations, two to three discussion meetings were organized during the study to discuss issues and exchange learning experiences. Leading cadres of various organizations and enterprises have led this study very seriously. The persons in charge of general units have all made reports on Stalin's life and reports answering questions to the personnel of their units. The机关(jī guān – organization) of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China published study bulletins during the study period, and some organizations in Shanghai held a photo exhibition on Stalin's life to help with the study. More than 3,000 cadres studying culture in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and in Gui Sui City of Suiyuan Province also organized studies in the form of classes.
    This study has had a significant impact in turning grief into strength and doing a good job. Many young cadres in the Northeast Administrative Committee have voluntarily written letters of determination and made specific plans for progress. More than 30 Communist Party members of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions wrote letters of determination to the branch, expressing their determination to learn from Comrade Stalin's spirit of dedicating his life to the revolution and to do a good job. In the past, the capital construction section of the Tianjin Bicycle Factory failed to complete its tasks every month. After this study, they proposed: resolutely complete the March task. By the 28th, they had basically completed the task for the entire month. After this study, workers at the Southwest 405 Coal Mine created a new coal mining record, which was 3.9% higher than the previous record. After studying the documents, the Southwest 27497 Factory implemented high-speed cutting methods in three major workshops and assembly line operations when inspecting products. More than 95% of the 130 police officers in the Jiang'an District Public Security Bureau of Wuhan City wrote letters of determination and guarantees. After studying, all staff members of the Fujian Province Shuiji County Branch of the People's Bank of China launched a work improvement competition. All staff members of the Construction Works Section of the Fuzhou City Construction Bureau made six vows and posted them under Stalin's portrait. Cadres in Ledu County, Qinghai Province, unanimously expressed their intention to commemorate Stalin with practical actions to do a good job in all tasks. After this study, medical and nursing teams in various departments of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital actively promoted the Soviet medical system.
    A large number of members of the Communist Youth League, general workers, and non-Party cadres further enhanced their class awareness through this study and applied to join the Communist Party of China or the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Communist Party branches in various organizations in Shanghai have received many comrades' applications to join the Party, some expressing that they will often use Stalin's ideological qualities and work style to examine their own work and style.
    Some people with more serious individualistic ideas have made great improvements in this study. Among the Han cadres newly transferred to work in the Guangxi Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, some who were originally uneasy about their work automatically made self-criticisms during this study and put forward guarantees to do a good job. Du Shengdu, an engineer at the Nanning City Brick and Tile Factory in Guangxi Province, had always kept his technology a secret and was unwilling to impart it to others. During this study, he was moved by Stalin's great contribution to the world communist cause, so at a study discussion meeting, he expressed his determination: "Open up the technology and teach the apprentices well."

    认真学习了悼念斯大林同志的文件
    全国各地机关干部和工矿职工觉悟提高
    全国各地机关干部和工厂矿山的职工已基本结束悼念斯大林同志的文件的学习。
    在这次学习中，各地机关干部和工矿职工表现出来的高度认真精神与自觉性，充分说明了斯大林的伟大形象是多么深刻地铭刻在中国人民的心中。许多人除了学习悼念斯大林的文件外，还自动阅读斯大林的著作和论述斯大林的书籍。很多人还订立了今后个人经常学习斯大林著作的计划。中南区一级机关和武汉市各机关的干部对中共中央所规定阅读的文件一般都精读过五遍到十遍，并且都作了学习笔记。武汉市许多机关干部除了在每天早晨规定的学习时间内学习外，并在休息时间内自动阅读斯大林的著作。东北一级和沈阳市一级机关在学习中，都组织了两次到三次座谈会，讨论问题，交流学习体会。各机关、企业的领导干部都十分认真地领导这一次学习。一般单位的负责人都向本单位人员作了关于斯大林生平的报告以及解答问题的报告。中共江苏省委员会机关在学习期间出版了学习简报，上海市部分机关并举办了关于斯大林生平的图片展览会，以帮助学习。内蒙古自治区和绥远省归绥市一级的学文化的三千多干部，也都以上课的方式组织了学习。
    这次学习，在化悲痛为力量做好工作方面，起了显著的影响。东北行政委员会的许多青年干部都自动写了决心书，并订出具体的进步计划。河北省总工会有三十多个共产党员向支部写决心书，表示决心学习斯大林同志把一生贡献给革命的精神，做好工作。天津自行车厂基本建设科过去每月完不成任务，这次学习后，他们提出：坚决完成三月份任务。到二十八日止，已基本上完成了全月任务。西南四○五煤矿的工人，在这次学习后创造了采煤新纪录，比原来最高纪录高百分之三点九。西南二七四九七厂学习文件后，三个主要车间推行了高速切削法，检验产品时推行了流水作业法。武汉市江岸区人民政府公安局一百三十名员警中有百分之九十五以上写了决心书、保证书。中国人民银行福建省水吉县支行全体工作人员在学习后发起了一个改进工作的竞赛运动。福州市建设局工务股全体工作人员订了六条誓约，贴在斯大林的遗像下面。青海省乐都县的干部一致表示要以做好各项工作的实际行动来纪念斯大林。陕西省人民医院各科的医护小组在这次学习后，积极推行了苏联的医疗制度。
    大批青年团员、一般职工和非党干部通过这次学习进一步提高了阶级觉悟，纷纷申请加入中国共产党或中国新民主主义青年团。上海市各机关中共支部都收到许多同志要求入党的志愿书，有的表示要经常以斯大林的思想品质和工作作风来检查自己的工作和作风。
    有些个人主义思想较严重的人，在这次学习中有了很大改进。新调往广西省桂西僮族自治区工作的汉族干部中，有些原来不安心工作的，在这次学习中都自动作了检讨，并提出了做好工作的保证。广西省南宁市砖瓦厂工程师杜圣督一向把自己的技术保守着秘密，不肯传授给别人，在这次学习中，他为斯大林对世界共产主义事业的伟大贡献所感动，于是在一次学习讨论会上表示了决心：“公开技术，教好徒弟”。
