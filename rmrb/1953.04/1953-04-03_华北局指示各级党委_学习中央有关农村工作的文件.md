The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued instructions on March 29th to study the CPC Central Committee's instructions to party committees at all levels regarding spring plowing and production, the CPC Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and the People's Daily editorials on the above documents. The instructions stated: Studying these documents well is key to leading agricultural production well at present. Therefore, the sub-bureaus and provincial committees should immediately print these three documents into small booklets and widely distribute them to cadres at all levels above the district committee. The rural work departments of the provincial committees and the county and banner committees should not only organize the agricultural departments, cooperatives, and other relevant units of governments at all levels to study carefully, allocating a certain amount of time to study the documents in depth, but also conduct inspections in connection with reality.

In order to ensure that these documents are fully and thoroughly implemented and can be mastered by all district and village cadres, the instructions also proposed that party committees at all levels should pay attention to making reports at appropriate meetings, compiling and printing popular booklets, and organizing work groups to go to districts and villages to convey the documents, so that all district and village cadres can carry out work according to the instructions.

    华北局指示各级党委
    学习中央有关农村工作的文件
    中共中央华北局在三月二十九日发出学习中共中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示、中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议及人民日报有关以上文件的社论的指示。指示中说：学好这些文件是当前能否领导好农业生产的关键。因此，分局、省委应立即把这三个文件印成小册子，普遍散发给区委以上的各级干部。省委的农村工作部和各县、各旗党委不仅应组织各级人民政府的农业部门、合作社等有关单位认真学习，划出一定时间精读文件，而且要联系实际，进行检查。
    为使这些文件全面深入贯彻下去，并能为全体区、村干部掌握，指示中还提出：各级党委要注意在适当会议上作报告，编印通俗小册子，并组织下乡工作组在区、村进行传达，做到使所有区、村干部能依据指示进行工作。（新华社）
