Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Su Lü reports from Bitong:

	They Left With Gratitude and Hope for Peace
	After Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the Korean armistice negotiations reached the POW camps on the Korean-Chinese side, it immediately sparked heated discussions in the camps. The POWs unanimously agreed that Premier Zhou Enlai's statement was reasonable. This statement not only fully agreed to the exchange of sick and wounded POWs during the war but also proposed a fair solution to the entire POW issue, breaking the deadlock in the Korean armistice negotiations. American POW Schwab said, "I believe that every family member and mother of British and American POWs will sincerely appreciate and support Premier Zhou's statement, because this statement gives their children hope of returning home." Welsh said, "This is the fairest and simplest solution, and it truly demonstrates the sincerity of the Chinese and Korean sides towards peace. Its fairest aspect is its final disposition of the POWs—all returning home."
	As the discussions progressed between the liaison groups of both sides in Panmunjom regarding the repatriation of sick and wounded POWs, preparations for the repatriation of sick and wounded POWs on the Korean-Chinese side began intensively. Under conditions of inconvenient transportation and material difficulties, the POW camp authorities did their best to complete the preparations for repatriation in the shortest possible time. After careful examination by our medical personnel, the sick and wounded POWs from various POW camps successively arrived at Bitong for centralization.
	The repatriated sick and wounded POWs were warmly received by our side upon arrival at the central location. They enjoyed abundant and palatable food and comfortable and clean beds. Doctors and nurses from the Korean-Chinese side patiently cared for them.
	The POWs spoke to our staff happily and with gratitude about their lives in the POW camps. They unanimously appreciated the lenient policy of the Korean-Chinese side. American POW Morrison said, "In these two years, I did not think of myself as a prisoner. A person with conscience will definitely be grateful to the Chinese and Korean people." African-American POW McCallen said, "We black people have always been discriminated against in the past. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army are the first people in my life to treat us equally. I am very grateful for your friendly attitude towards us. This alone is enough to convince our people that you have a lenient policy towards prisoners." Turkish POW Arif said, "I will never forget your care for our religious aspects. You not only allowed us to pray but also took special care of us in terms of diet. If I were to deny the Chinese's lenient policy towards prisoners, God would not allow it."
	These POWs are direct participants in the Korean War and direct victims of the war. The good treatment they received in the Korean-Chinese POW camps made them deeply feel the preciousness of peace and the sincerity of the Chinese and Korean people towards peace. In their farewell remarks, South African POW Gaisson said, "I have been a prisoner for more than a year. Through the facts I have lived with and seen with my own eyes, I have gained some understanding of the Chinese people. Although our beliefs are different and our views are different, our desire for peace is the same. From many newspapers, magazines, and pictorials, I know how enthusiastically your hundreds of millions of people are building your country and loving peace!"
	The Korean-Chinese side's lenient policy towards POWs was specifically and centrally manifested on the day before the POWs' repatriation. On this day, the POW camp held a grand farewell meeting. At the meeting, the leaders of the POW camp delivered sincere and moving farewell speeches to the POWs. Representatives of the POWs who remained also spoke to them, urging them not to betray the lenient policy of the Korean-Chinese side, not to forget the friends who remained behind, and to do their best to bring about peace in Korea as soon as possible so that everyone could go home and reunite with their families.
	At the meeting, many sick and wounded POWs also gave farewell speeches, deeply expressing their gratitude to the Korean-Chinese side and their desire for peace. American POW Zah Dean said, "...I have decided to contact the families of the POWs who remain behind as much as possible after returning home, and tell them about the good treatment the POWs here have received, so that they will not worry about their loved ones." British POW Mitchell said, "I especially want to say a few words on behalf of those sick and wounded POWs, that is, we especially want to thank the medical staff of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who never stopped working for us. As for talking about going home, we are indeed very lucky, but we will never forget those friends who remain behind. We must do our best to promote the realization of the Korean armistice."
	A grand banquet was held after the farewell meeting. Many POWs toasted the staff of the Korean-Chinese side, shaking hands and embracing every staff member present. Some POWs even insisted that the interpreter take him to the kitchen, shake hands with the cooks one by one, and request that his words of gratitude be translated verbatim. After the banquet, an American POW Indian, Rutherford, who had never been very talkative, tightly held the hand of an interpreter who had been with him for a long time, and tears couldn't help but flow down.
	At the reception that evening, the POWs watched movies, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's cultural troupe performed Chinese folk songs and dances for them. They repeatedly requested to sing their favorite songs such as "The White-Haired Girl," and even hummed along themselves. Before the end of the party, in order to thank the cultural troupe for their performance, all the sick and wounded POWs who were to be repatriated went on stage and sang a British folk song in unison: "Auld Lang Syne!"
	The next day, as trucks decorated with red cloth signs drove one after another along the pine-covered hillsides and steep riverbanks, the sick and wounded POWs who were being repatriated kept looking back at Bitong, frequently waving goodbye to the staff of the Korean-Chinese side who were sending them off and to the POWs who remained behind.
	The words of American POW Morrison may represent the feelings of the POWs at this moment. Morrison said, "I really love this place, Bitong. These mountains, these trees, may seem ordinary at ordinary times, but now, because of that unforgettable life of more than two years in the past, I really deeply love them!"

    他们是带着感激的心情和和平的希望走的
    新华社特约记者  苏旅
    在周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明传到了朝中方面的战俘营以后，战俘营里立刻掀起了热烈的议论。战俘们一致认为：周恩来总理的声明是合理的。这个声明不仅完全同意在战争期间交换病伤战俘，而且提出了解决全部战俘问题的公正的办法，为朝鲜停战谈判打开了僵局。美国战俘施瓦伯说：“我相信，每一个英美战俘的家属和母亲都会衷心感激和拥护周总理的声明，因为这个声明使得他们的孩子有了回家的希望。”魏尔希说：“这是最公正的、也是最简单的办法，它确实是一再表现了中、朝方面对和平的诚意。它最公正的地方，就是它对战俘最后的处理——全部回家。”
    随着板门店双方联络组关于遣返病伤战俘问题讨论的进展，朝中方面遣送病伤战俘的准备工作紧张地开始了。在交通不便、物质困难的条件下，战俘营当局尽了他们最大的努力，在最短期间内完成了遣俘的准备工作。各战俘营的病伤战俘经过我方医务人员的细心检查以后，陆续到达碧潼集中。
    被遣返的病伤战俘们到达集中地点之后，受到了我方的热情招待。享用着丰富适口的饮食和舒适而清洁的床位。朝中方面的医生们和护士们耐心地护理着他们。
    战俘们向我方工作人员愉快而满怀感激地谈论着战俘营的生活。他们一致感激朝中方面的宽待政策。美国战俘摩里逊说：“这两年来我没有想到自己是一个俘虏。有良心的人，一定会对中、朝人民感激的。”美国战俘黑人麦克卡伦说：“我们黑人在过去从来都是受人歧视的，中国人民志愿军是我一生中第一次平等看待我们的人。你们对我们这种友爱的态度，使我非常感激。单是这一点，已足够说服我们的人民相信你们的宽待俘虏政策了。”土耳其战俘阿里夫说：“我永远也忘不了你们对我们宗教方面的照顾。你们不但允许我们做礼拜，并且在饮食方面特别照顾我们。如果我要否认中国人的宽待俘虏政策，上帝是不允许的。”
    这些战俘都是朝鲜战争的直接参加者，也是战争的直接受害者。他们在朝中战俘营中所受到的良好待遇，使他们深深感到和平的可贵和中、朝人民对和平的诚意。在话别中，南非战俘盖森说：“我被俘一年多，在相处和亲眼见到的事实中，使我对中国人民多少有了些了解。尽管我们的信仰不同，见解有区别，但我们对和平的愿望是一致的。从好些报纸、杂志和画报上，我知道你们几万万人民怎样热情地建设你们的国家，热爱着和平！”
    朝中方面对战俘的宽待政策，具体而集中地表现在战俘们遣返之前的一天中。在这一天，战俘营举行了一次隆重的告别会。会上，战俘营的首长对战俘们致了恳切而动人的告别辞。留下的战俘代表也对他们说了话，要他们不要辜负朝中方面的宽待政策，不要忘掉留下来的朋友们，要他们回国后尽力使朝鲜的和平早日到来，使大家都能回家和家人团聚。
    在会上，很多病伤战俘也纷纷致了告别辞，深深地道出了他们对朝中方面的感激以及对和平的愿望。美国战俘扎赫·迪安说：“……我决定回国以后，尽量和留下的战俘们的家庭取得联系，告诉他们这里的战俘们所受到良好的待遇，这样就会使他们不致为他们亲爱的人们担忧了。”英国战俘密契尔说：“我特别要代那些病伤战俘们说几句话，这就是我们尤其要感谢中国人民志愿军的医务工作人员，他们为了我们从不停止地工作。至于谈到我们要回家，我们的确是很幸运的，但是我们绝不会忘记那些留下的朋友们的。我们一定要尽力促成朝鲜停战的实现。”
    告别会后举行了丰盛的宴会。很多战俘向朝中方面工作人员敬酒，与每一个在场的工作人员握手、拥抱。有的战俘甚至一定要翻译人员带他到厨房里去，一个个地和炊事人员握手，并要求把他的感谢的话语，逐句地翻译出来。宴会后，一个向来不大爱说话的美国战俘印第安人鲁瑟弗德紧紧地握着和他在一起很久的一个翻译人员的手，热泪禁不住簌簌地流了下来。
    当天的招待晚会上，战俘们看了电影，中国人民志愿军的文工队并给他们表演了中国民间歌舞。他们几次地要求唱他们平时最爱听的“白毛女”等歌曲，并且自己也跟着哼起来。在晚会结束之前，为了答谢文工队的演奏，全体被遣送的病伤战俘们上台齐声合唱了一支英国的民歌：“别了，老朋友！”
    第二天，当装饰着红布标志的卡车，一辆接一辆地沿着长满松树的山坡和陡峻的江岸驶去的时候，被遣送的病伤战俘们不断地向碧潼回顾，频频地挥手向送行的朝中方面工作人员和留下的战俘们告别。
    美国战俘摩里逊所说的话，或许可以代表战俘们此刻的心情。摩里逊说：“我真爱碧潼这个地方。这些山，这些树，也许平时觉得很普通，但现在为了过去那一段两年多令人难忘的生活的原故，我真深深地爱它们！”
