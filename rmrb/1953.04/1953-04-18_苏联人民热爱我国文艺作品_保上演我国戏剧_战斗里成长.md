Xinhua News Agency report: The Gorky Library in Stalingrad, Soviet Union, recently held an exhibition of Chinese literature, which was welcomed by readers. The library also held a special discussion meeting for readers to discuss the novel "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River" by Chinese female writer Ding Ling, which won the Stalin Prize. Participants in the discussion pointed out that the Soviet people are extremely interested in this novel. A female reader, Mosuntzova, praised Ding Ling for shaping the image of Communist Party members in this novel. On the 11th, the Repin School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture in Leningrad held a meeting to discuss the creations of Chinese painters. Attendees pointed out that Chinese satirical posters have profound ideological content, most of which have clear and easy-to-understand themes and superb techniques.

In early April, the Gabrovo National Theatre in Bulgaria premiered the drama "Growing Up in Battle," adapted by Chinese writer Hu Ke. The actors did their utmost to show the high fighting spirit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the love of the Chinese people for the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Communist Party, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the great Soviet Union. They also strived to realistically portray the growth of Zhao Tiezhu's family in the struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the exploitative system. This performance was welcomed by the audience.
