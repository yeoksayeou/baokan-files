Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: The Soviet Union is vigorously preparing for summer rest and recuperation, with new sanatoriums, rest homes, and Young Pioneer camps constantly being added. According to TASS, the Soviet Union now has more than two thousand sanatoriums and a large number of health centers, where more than five million people will recuperate this year. As the summer recuperation period approaches, recuperation agencies in various regions are actively preparing for their opening. Many recuperation agencies are adding new equipment and building new houses, clubs, dining halls, etc. New sanatoriums and rest homes are under construction. Last year, Soviet trade unions established fifteen new sanatoriums and rest homes, and this year the number will increase to more than fifty, with more than seven thousand additional beds. In Sochi-Matsesta, a famous resort on the Black Sea coast known for its mineral springs and beautiful scenery, a trade union sanatorium, the "Matsesta Valley" sanatorium, will open in April. Sanatoriums built for workers in light industry, the food industry, and the machine-building industry will also open soon. In the Georgian Republic, more than 150 million rubles have been allocated for this purpose this year. Twenty new sanatoriums and rest homes are under construction. A magnificent railway workers' sanatorium has been completed. The construction of a seamen's sanatorium with several beautiful buildings is underway, and sanatoriums for power station workers, construction workers, and staff are also being built. In the Azerbaijan Republic, the newly developed recuperation area of Isti-Su will open for the first time this summer. This resort is not only picturesque but also has hot springs. In the Ukrainian Republic, a total of fifty sanatoriums will open this year, ten of which will double their beds this summer; in addition, twenty-eight seasonal sanatoriums will be established.
	Soviet trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and various public organizations are busy preparing for the opening of summer Young Pioneer camps. This summer, summer Young Pioneer camps will be opened on the Black Sea coast in Crimea and the Caucasus, on the banks of the Volga, Kama, Dnieper, and Don rivers, on the Gulf of Finland and the Riga coast, in the forests of the Moscow region, and in other picturesque areas. This year, trade union organizations will spend 648 million rubles on summer Young Pioneer camps, which will provide vacations for three million children, 460,000 more than last year. In addition, the Soviet Union has established a large number of "country homes" for children. By June, the Moscow region will have more than 1,200 "country homes" for 450,000 teenagers to spend the summer.
