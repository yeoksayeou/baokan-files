Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 15th: The senior command of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Eastern Front issued a commendation order on April 11 to the infantry, artillery, and transportation units that made significant contributions in the battle for an unnamed high ground near Bianyan Cave.

The commendation order stated: This battle was fought very well. In ten days of fierce fighting, our participating units achieved a victory of annihilating more than 1,500 enemies at a small cost. The commendation order pointed out that the reasons for obtaining this victory were that the participating units had made sufficient preparations before the battle, the artillery fire was tightly organized, the infantry and artillery coordinated closely, and the command was flexible; the unit's attack movements were sudden and brave, and the defense was calm and tenacious; not only were the defending enemies annihilated, but also a large number of enemies were killed and wounded in repeated battles for the high ground. The commendation order called on the fighting troops to sum up their experiences well and continue to annihilate the enemies who dare to counterattack.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 15th: Our army on the Eastern Front continued to repel the enemy's frantic counterattacks on an unnamed high ground near Bianyan Cave, northwest of Wendeng-ri, and bombarded the enemy with artillery and mortar fire. From the night of the 10th to the daytime of the 13th, our army annihilated more than 400 enemy troops.

In order to escape the powerful artillery fire of our army, the enemy's counterattacks in the past few days have been carried out at night. On the night of the 10th, the enemy once occupied the forward positions on the southern end of the high ground, but our infantry repelled the enemy with artillery support. Later, two platoons of the enemy came to sneak attack, but were repelled by our infantry. Around dawn on the 11th, the enemy launched three attacks with two companies of troops, but all failed under the counterattack of our infantry and the fierce bombardment of our mortar fire. That night, the enemy suffered more than 130 casualties. On the night of the 11th, the enemy launched two attacks with one to two companies of troops. After being repelled, the enemy launched three group charges against our army in multiple routes with two battalions of troops. Our infantry, with the support of artillery and mortar fire, engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy for one hour, killing and wounding more than 220 enemy troops.

On the evening of the 12th, the enemy launched several attacks on our army with one platoon to one battalion of troops. One enemy force once occupied our forward fortifications, but quickly retreated under the brave counterattack of eight of our soldiers. That night, the enemy suffered more than 70 casualties.

During the day on the 12th and 13th, our artillery continuously bombarded the enemy's gathering places, killing and wounding many enemy troops.

The Third Division of the Li puppet army suffered heavy casualties in this battle and is now rushing to transfer new recruits from Busan to join the battle. Some new recruits boarded trains in Busan on the 10th, were rushed into position on the 11th, and were killed or captured by our army in the attack on the 12th.

    朝鲜东线边岩洞附近某高地争夺战中
    我军在十天内歼敌一千五百多人
    东线我军高级领导机关通令嘉奖参战各部队
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】东线中国人民志愿军高级指挥机关，四月十一日通令嘉奖在边岩洞附近某无名高地战斗中功绩显著的步兵部队、炮兵部队和运输部队。
    嘉奖令说：这个仗打得很好，在十天激烈的战斗中，我参战部队以小的代价取得了歼敌一千五百多人的胜利。嘉奖令指出获得这一胜利的原因是，参战部队在战前有充分的准备，炮火组织严密，步炮协同密切，指挥灵活；部队攻击动作突然、勇猛，守得沉着顽强；不仅歼灭了守敌，并且在反复的争夺战中大量地杀伤了敌人。嘉奖令号召战斗部队很好地总结经验，继续歼灭敢于前来反扑的敌人。
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】我军在东线文登里西北边岩洞附近某无名高地上继续打退敌人的疯狂反扑，并用大炮和迫击炮火轰击敌人。自十日夜间到十三日白天，我军又歼灭敌军四百多名。
    敌人为逃避我军强大炮火的打击，这几天的反扑都在夜间进行。十日夜间，敌人曾一度占领高地南端的前沿阵地，但我步兵在炮火支援下将敌击退。以后，敌人两个排来偷袭，又被我军步兵打退。十一日拂晓前后，敌军以两个连的兵力进行了三次攻击，但都在我军步兵部队的反冲锋和我军迫击炮火的猛烈轰击下失败了。这一夜，敌军伤亡了一百三十多名。十一日夜，敌军以一个连到两个连的兵力进行了两次进攻，被击退以后，敌军又以两个营的兵力分多路向我军进行三次集团冲锋。我军步兵在大炮和迫击炮火力的支援下，与敌人进行了一小时的激烈战斗，杀伤敌军二百二十多名。
    十二日晚，敌军又以一个排到一个营的兵力先后向我军进行数次攻击。有一股敌军曾一度占领我前沿工事，但很快就在我军八位勇士勇猛的反冲锋下败退了。这一夜，敌军伤亡七十多人。
    在十二日和十三日的白天，我军炮兵曾不断地向敌军集结的地方进行轰击，杀伤了许多敌军。
    李伪军第三师在这一场战斗中遭到了很重的伤亡，现在正急忙从釜山调来新兵投入战斗。有的新兵十日在釜山上火车，十一日被赶入阵地，十二日就在进攻中被我军打死或俘掳了。
