Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 2nd: On March 28th, the U.S. side murdered another captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Moseulpo Prisoner of War Camp on Jeju Island. The U.S. side lied and said that this prisoner of war was murdered by other prisoners of war. As everyone knows, the U.S. side once claimed that those detained in Moseulpo were so-called "anti-communist" prisoners of war. Now, the facts prove that these prisoners of war are fighting resolutely, even at the cost of sacrifice, to demand repatriation.

    美方又在济州岛谋害战俘一名
    【新华社开城二日电】三月二十八日，美方又在济州岛摹瑟浦战俘营中谋害中国人民志愿军被俘人员一名。美方撒谎说这名战俘是被其他战俘谋害的。大家知道，美方曾经宣称被拘留在摹瑟浦的都是所谓“反共”的战俘，现在事实证明，这些战俘正在不惜牺牲，坚决为要求遣返而斗争。
