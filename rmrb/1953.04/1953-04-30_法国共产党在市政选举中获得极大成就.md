(Xinhua News Agency, April 29th) According to TASS, Paris: Preliminary results of the municipal elections held on the 26th in various provinces of mainland France and overseas territories have been announced. Newspapers point out that more than 75 percent of voters participated in the election. Although reactionary groups took measures to obstruct the Communist Party's campaign, the Communist Party still achieved great success.

    According to preliminary materials, in Paris, the votes obtained by the Communist Party accounted for 25.83 percent of all votes; the Independent Party accounted for 22.37 percent; the Left Republican Alliance accounted for 11.98 percent; De Gaulle's French People's Rally accounted for 11.22 percent; the Socialist Party accounted for 9.55 percent; and the Catholic People's Republican Movement accounted for 7.95 percent. In the suburbs of Paris, the Communist Party's votes accounted for 41.11 percent of all votes.

    The preliminary results of the election show that compared with the 1947 municipal elections, the French Communist Party has greatly improved its position in many regions. For example, in Rungis in the Paris region, the votes cast for Communist Party candidates increased from 33 percent of the total to 39 percent; in Bondy, from 48 percent to 50 percent; in Champigny, from 51 percent to 55.5 percent; and in Romainville, from 57.4 percent to 63.77 percent. In the northern suburbs of Paris, the votes cast for Communists increased from 41.73 percent in 1947 to 44 percent currently.

    In Marseille, Communist Party candidates won about one-third of all votes. In many places, various reactionary parties formed election blocs to oppose the Communists, but they failed to win. For example, in Saint-Pierre-des-Corps in the Indre-et-Loire department, Communist Party candidates received 400 more votes than the joint list of the Socialist Party, the French People's Rally, and the People's Republican Movement; in Seclin in the Nord department and Villeparisis in the Seine-et-Marne department, the Communist Party also defeated the Socialist Party and the French People's Rally bloc. The French Communist Party not only maintained its position in many municipal councils where it was originally in a leading position, but also gained new leadership positions in the municipal councils of Castelmoron, Duras, and Aiguillon in the Lot-et-Garonne department, Argeliers in the Aude department, Mont-Saint-Quentin and Piennes in the Somme department, and some municipal councils in the Alpes-Maritimes department. Henri Martin, a young patriot imprisoned for opposing the Vietnam colonial war, has been elected as a municipal councillor.

    According to a bulletin from the French Ministry of the Interior on the preliminary results of the election, De Gaulle's party has lost a large number of votes throughout the country. The victory of the Communist Party and the serious failure of De Gaulle's party demonstrate the French people's determination to defend the republican system and democratic freedoms and to oppose the threat of fascism.

    法国共产党在市政选举中获得极大成就
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国本土和海外领地各省在二十六日举行的市政选举的初步结果，已经公布。报纸指出，百分之七十五以上的选民参加了投票。虽然反动集团采取了阻挠共产党竞选的措施，但是共产党仍然获得极大成就。
    根据初步材料，在巴黎，共产党所获得的票数，占全部选票百分之二十五点八三；独立党占百分之二十二点三七；左翼共和联盟占百分之十一点九八；戴高乐的法兰西人民联盟占百分之十一点二二；社会党占百分之九点五五；天主教的人民共和党占百分之七点九五。在巴黎郊区，共产党的票数占全部选票百分之四十一点一一。
    选举的初步结果表明：和一九四七年市政选举相较，法国共产党在许多地区大大改善了自己的地位。譬如在巴黎区的伦吉斯，投票选举共产党候选人的从占总数百分之三十三增加到百分之三十九；波奈，从占百分之四十八增加到百分之五十；祥地里，从占百分之五十一增加到百分之五十五点五；罗曼维勒，从占百分之五十七点四增加到百分之六十三点七七。在巴黎北部郊区，投票选举共产党人的一九四七年占百分之四十一点七三，而目前增加到百分之四十四。
    在马赛，共产党候选人约获得全部选票的三分之一。在许多地方，各反动党派结成竞选集团来反对共产党人，可是并没有能够获得胜利。譬如在昂德尔—罗亚尔省的圣比尔德戈尔，共产党候选人就比社会党、法兰西人民联盟、人民共和党的联合名单多得四百票；在诺尔省的赛克林和塞纳—马恩省的维勒巴利西，共产党也战胜了社会党和法兰西人民联盟的集团。法国共产党不仅在原来居于领导地位的许多市政委员会里保持了自己的地位，而且还在罗特—加隆省的卡泰尔摩朗、杜斯、爱伦，奥德省的阿尔耶利耶，索姆省的蒙圣甘坦和毕阿士以及阿尔卑斯海滨省的一些市政委员会里，取得了新的领导地位。因反对越南殖民战争而被囚狱中的青年爱国者亨利·马丁，已经当选市政委员。
    据法国内政部关于选举初步结果的公报，戴高乐党在全国各地丧失了大量选票。共产党的胜利和戴高乐党的严重失败，说明法国人民决心保卫共和制度和民主自由，反对法西斯主义的威胁。
