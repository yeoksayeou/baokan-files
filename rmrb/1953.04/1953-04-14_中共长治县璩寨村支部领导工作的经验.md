The Quzhai Village of Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, was a relatively backward village before 1949. After three years of arduous work by the village branch, it has now transformed from a backward village into an advanced one, with all work in the village progressing vigorously and steadily.

Before 1949, the Quzhai Village Party branch was a relatively backward branch. Among the thirty-two party members, only five, including Gou Peifang, actively worked. The rest were: fifteen who needed to be pushed to act, and twelve who wouldn't even attend meetings when called. After the land reform, most party members developed the idea that "the revolution has succeeded" and busied themselves with developing their individual families' affairs. For example, Niu Xiaotu said: "The Japanese have been driven away, the landlords have been overthrown, and living standards have improved. It's time to rest from work and let everyone work hard on their own production!" Some even said: "Whether or not you're a party member is all the same, it just leads to more work absences for meetings." There was also disunity between natural villages due to historical reasons. Now, this situation has undergone a fundamental change: Among the current twenty-nine party members, except for one whose thinking is relatively backward and needs to be further educated, every party member in the branch is actively working with vigor to improve patriotic production increase and mutual assistance and cooperation. There is unprecedented unity between the natural villages. Now, some of the masses even find the terms "South Quzhai" and "North Quzhai" unpleasant to hear. They say: "We are one administrative village, why are we called two villages?" More importantly, because the branch has carried out education on the direction of rural economic development both inside and outside the Party, it has gradually guided the masses of the entire village to the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. Now, 97 percent of the households and 99 percent of the labor force in the village have been organized into agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams. Based on being organized, they have improved production techniques and released the potential of agricultural production, and production is gradually increasing. The agricultural production index in 1950 reached 120 percent of the highest level before the War of Resistance Against Japan, increased to 151 percent in 1951, and rapidly increased to 209 percent in 1952. The lives of the masses are also getting better year by year. The farmers all say: "If it weren't for the Communist Party leading so well, how could we have such a good life?" The transformation of Quzhai Village branch from backward to advanced in the past three years is mainly due to the strengthening of the branch's ideological work, the correct development of criticism and self-criticism, and the political education of the people. The experience of Quzhai branch's leadership work is introduced below.

Strengthen Ideological Education and Constantly Improve
The Class Consciousness of Party Members

The Quzhai branch began to pay attention to ideological education work in 1950. Before this, although the branch had undergone the first party rectification in 1948 and the ideological awareness of party members had improved, the relaxation of ideological leadership after the rectification soon led to the resurgence of backward thinking among party members, and various tasks became slack. At this time, Comrade Gou Peifang had been discharged from the army for two years, and he discovered this problem. He thought: "When charging into battle in the army, the Communist Party members always took the lead. Why can't the rural party members take the lead in work like the party members in the army?" Gou Peifang had also once looked down on the party members in the village, but he also thought that he should help the branch strengthen its ideological and organizational work, rather than adopt an incorrect attitude. So he proposed to the branch to carry out basic party knowledge education among the party members. This proposal was quickly accepted by the branch committee, and it was decided that Gou Peifang would serve as the branch instructor. After explaining how to be a Communist Party member in light of the ideological situation of the party members, most party members recognized the great future of communism and the fighting goals of party members. In the discussion, they also criticized erroneous ideas such as "the revolution has succeeded" and "burying oneself in individual production." After studying "The Rights and Obligations of Communist Party Members," Cheng Fusuo said: "Comparing these conditions with ourselves, we are Communist Party members in name, but in reality, we are full of peasant thoughts." Wang Shuqin reviewed: "In the past, we didn't publicize the Party's policies to the masses, nor did we promptly reflect the demands of the people. We just hung up the glorious title of a party member." After this education, the ideological awareness of most party members was improved. At the same time, the branch also deeply realized the importance of conducting regular ideological education for party members, and all party members unanimously passed that the first, eleventh, and twenty-first of each month would be "Party Member Study Days." This study system has been adhered to until now and has never been interrupted.

In addition to lecturing on basic party knowledge, the Quzhai branch also paid attention to conducting education through specific events. For example, in 1950, Qu Chunhong, a party member from North Quzhai Village, favored the migrant workers in his natural village during the allocation of labor. The branch criticized his selfish behavior. Through the discussion of this matter, not only did Qu Chunhong himself realize that this selfish practice was wrong, but also all party members understood that they must be fair and selfless in serving the people. Another example is when hoeing wheat in 1951, the branch proposed to mobilize the entire village to hoe the wheat fields thoroughly. When party member Zhang Huaibao saw Zhao Longze strolling on the street, he scolded Zhao Longze and said: "Why don't you hoe the wheat? What will you use to resist the U.S. and aid Korea?" Zhao Longze said: "Look! You even control this, it's none of your business if I don't hoe the wheat!" At that time, Zhang Huaibao put a label on Zhao Longze: "Not responding to the government's call, sabotaging the wheat hoeing task." The two of them argued back and forth for a long time, and some of the masses were still unwilling to hoe the wheat. Zhang Huaibao reported this matter to the branch, and the branch immediately criticized Zhang Huaibao for his coercive and commanding approach. In order to teach him to learn the method of following the mass line, they let him and Cheng Fusuo jointly mobilize the masses to hoe the wheat. Cheng Fusuo's approach was to first explain to the masses the benefits of hoeing the wheat in the drought, and then explain the reason why only by intensifying the hoeing of wheat and producing more grain can they have the strength to support the volunteers. After this explanation, the masses took action, and finally, 100 percent of the wheat hoeing task was completed. Zhang Huaibao received a profound education in this work. The branch used the two different working methods of Cheng Fusuo and Zhang Huaibao to conduct comparative education among all party members, so that everyone recognized that coercion and command do not work, and only by following the mass line can the task be completed.

The Quzhai branch also paid attention to conducting policy education in various central tasks. When the mutual assistance and cooperation movement was launched in 1950, some party members were not very clear about the significance of mutual assistance and cooperation, so some party members were unwilling to participate in mutual assistance and cooperation organizations. Some, although they participated, were not willing to actively lead, they thought: "As long as you are a farmer, who doesn't know how to farm?" Based on this situation, the branch conducted education on the policy of mutual assistance and cooperation within the Party, and paid attention to criticizing capitalist ideas. In carrying out education, they also used the facts of the beginning of class differentiation in the village to explain. After repeated ideological education, the petty-bourgeois economic thinking of some party members who fantasized about always maintaining a "well-off family" began to waver, and they realized that Communist Party members must adhere to the implementation of the Party's mutual assistance and cooperation policy. Last spring, the branch found that some party members, although they participated in mutual assistance and cooperation organizations, did not do a good job in agricultural production. At this time, the branch organized everyone to study part of Comrade Gao Gang's report "Overcoming the Intrusion of Bourgeois Ideology into the Party and Opposing Right-leaning Ideology within the Party" made at the meeting of senior cadres of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in January 1952, "On the Direction of Rural Economic Development." It was clearly recognized that the rural economy must take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. In this way, the mutual assistance and cooperation movement had new development.

The Quzhai branch also combined various movements to carry out patriotic and internationalist education. In 1951, when the national signature and voting campaign to support the conclusion of a peace treaty and oppose the United States' arming of Japan was launched, some party members did not pay much attention to this political struggle task. The branch immediately organized the party members to study articles related to this issue, and also used the most popular examples to educate everyone. After studying and explaining the significance of signing and voting in a popular way, everyone in the village signed and voted. In the movement to donate airplanes and cannons to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, after extensive publicity by party members and party propagandists, the village completed the donation task of 6.6 million yuan.

In addition to attending party classes, holding discussion meetings, and individual education, the Quzhai branch's educational work methods also paid attention to using party newspapers to conduct ideological education. Reading groups were widely organized among party members and villagers. When summarizing work, the branch also emphasized the importance of reading the newspaper; and told party members that the more arduous the work, the more important it is to learn from the advanced experience of various places, otherwise, it would be easy to get confused and not do the work well. In order to do this work well, the branch also established a reading guidance group. The task of the reading guidance group is to guide the reading groups on what news to read and what issues to discuss, based on the instructions of the higher party committee and the current central tasks, combined with the common problems existing in the village. Because of the establishment of the newspaper reading system, studying current events and learning from advanced experience became a habit. Some party members said: "The newspaper is the teacher. If you don't read the newspaper for a day, it's like being confused; if you don't read the newspaper for two days, you don't know anything; if you don't read the newspaper for many days, you're dizzy as if you're asleep."

Carry out Regular Criticism and Self-
Criticism to Improve Party Life

The branch truly regarded carrying out criticism and self-criticism as the driving force for the branch to move forward. The establishment of such a system in the Quzhai branch went through a struggle. Before 1950, criticism and self-criticism within the party were always difficult to develop. At that time, Gou Peifang was the branch's organization committee member. In order to overcome this unhealthy phenomenon, he had thought of many ways to change this situation, but he never achieved good results. At the beginning, he first reviewed his own shortcomings at the branch meeting, with the aim of inspiring others through his own review. But other comrades looked at me and I looked at you, and no one dared to speak up. Later, he adopted the method of reviewing himself and criticizing others to guide everyone. At one branch committee meeting, Gou Peifang criticized the then branch secretary Cheng Fusuo for not paying attention to the branch's educational work; at that time, Cheng Fusuo felt a little hot in his heart and couldn't bear it, but he also felt that Gou Peifang was right, so he reluctantly accepted it. Some party members felt that this was a bit "abnormal," "How can the branch committee member criticize the branch secretary?!" Xu Huaigen said to Qu Chunhong: "You are still active! The branch secretary has been criticized by Gou Peifang, how can you stand out!" Gou Peifang gradually found the reason why criticism could not be developed among party members in the actual process. If party members' awareness is not raised before, when they still do not know why to carry out the role and purpose of criticism and self-criticism, it is impossible to develop criticism. Therefore, Gou Peifang repeatedly explained to everyone the truth of Chairman Mao's theory that criticism is sweeping the floor, washing the face, and wiping the dust. In this way, everyone began to have a correct understanding of criticism and self-criticism. Later, after repeated use in several party meetings, this weapon was mastered by everyone. Party member Gu Huaishan (the village chief at the time) often excused himself for being busy with work and did not attend branch meetings. Although others saw that this was wrong, they did not dare to offer him opinions; when Gu Huaishan was not there, everyone quarreled fiercely, but when Gu Huaishan came, no one offered any opinions. After studying, everyone criticized him. As a result, Gu Huaishan improved his ideological awareness, worked actively, and was later elected as the branch organization committee member.

Because the criticism and self-criticism of the Quzhai branch are closely linked to the central tasks and the ideological situation of the party members in each period, it is not boring, dry, and empty, but rather substantive, lively, and active. This system has been adhered to.

In order to give full play to the collective leadership role of the branch committee, a strict division of labor was carried out among the branch committee members. The Quzhai branch has a total of nine committee members. Comrade Gou Peifang was elected as the branch secretary, responsible for overall leadership; Deputy Branch Secretaries Yang Yingtang and Cheng Fusuo, in addition to assisting the branch secretary in their work, each is also responsible for contacting the work of a natural village; the remaining branch committee members, in addition to being responsible for the party's organizational work, branch education, propaganda network, and mass organizations such as women, youth, armed public security, and production, are also divided into eight sections according to the distribution of residents in the village, and each branch committee member is assigned to be responsible for one section, to make regular contact with the masses. Due to the clear division of labor and clear responsibilities, the work of the branch committee has been greatly strengthened, and at the same time, the connection between the Party and the masses has been further strengthened.

Lead the Masses of the Whole Village to the Road of Patriotic Production Increase,
Mutual Assistance and Cooperation

How did the Quzhai branch unite the masses around the Party and move forward in the direction indicated by the Party? Branch Secretary Gou Peifang had been a fighter and a commander in the army, and he deeply understood that in order to win a battle, the correct command of the commander is of course important, but if the enthusiasm of all the fighters is not brought into play, it is impossible to win a beautiful battle. In terms of organizing and leading the masses, in addition to leading the masses to implement the Party's policies and resolutions through all party members, the branch also carried out propaganda through the Party's propaganda network. The branch's propaganda work has two systems: one is the leadership of the branch committee over the propaganda network, implementing a division of labor responsibility system. Each of the nine committee members of the branch committee is fixed to contact several propagandists, and the propagandists have also implemented a contract responsibility system. The second is the system of the branch committee regularly studying the ideological situation of the masses. For example, it is stipulated that the branch committee will conduct a discussion and research on the ideology of the masses once a month, and formulate propaganda plans and content based on the instructions of the higher authorities. Their propaganda work among the masses in various movements over the past three years has been based on investigation and research. They immediately report the reflections of the masses they hear in propaganda activities or daily life to the branch committee, and the branch committee puts forward opinions on conducting political education for the masses based on these situations. In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in the winter of 1950, due to neglecting political work, most of the masses were buried in production and did not care about resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea; a small number of the masses were also panicked. At that time, the branch first organized party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and propagandists to study the New Year's Day broadcast speech "We Must Closely Integrate Economic Construction Tasks with Political Struggle Tasks" of Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1951. Then, party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and propagandists widely publicized it to the masses. The propaganda especially focused on carrying out patriotic and internationalist ideological education. In addition to carrying out the above propaganda work, the branch also promoted the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system. On "Patriotic Inspection Day," every household in the village will check the implementation of the patriotic pact. The implementation of the patriotic pact is used to commend the good and criticize the backward.

The branch also carried out education on the direction of rural economic development among the masses, overcoming the conservative thinking of a few who believed that "production has reached the top." When the Gou Faxing mutual aid team developed into an agricultural producers' cooperative, the masses outside the team were full of enthusiasm for this further collectivized organization, but some farmers also thought: "Mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives are the same." The most important thing is that they saw that the grain harvested per mu by the Gou Faxing mutual aid team was more than double that before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and they thought that this had "reached the top." For example, Gou Faxing planned to apply 200 dan of base fertilizer to the high-yield grain land last year, and to harvest 750 jin of grain. Old farmer Jia Yinggui said: "It's hard to harvest 100 shi of grain without planting 100 mu of land. I have lived for 60 years, and I have also applied a lot of fertilizer, but I have never seen a mu of land that can harvest 1,700 or 800 jin of grain; don't just brag, it only counts if you harvest that much." When the branch solved this ideological problem, on the one hand, it tried to persuade everyone from the perspective of improving production technology and bringing into play the potential of agricultural production, and on the other hand, it used things that farmers had personally experienced to guide them to understand the problem. At first, they used the high-yield examples of Li Shunda and Guo Yu'en to persuade everyone. Some people solved some ideological problems, and some people still didn't believe it. Later, they used the example of Che Chunlan in the village harvesting 600 jin of corn per mu to educate everyone. This time, they solved the ideological problems of some people again. However, the ideological problem was thoroughly solved last autumn. Last year, Gou Faxing's agricultural producers' cooperative, after careful cultivation by all the members, harvested 935 jin per mu of high-yield land. On the day of the threshing, the branch organized the masses of the whole village to visit the site. This day coincided with "Patriotic Inspection Day," and the branch organized party member Gou Faxing to promote their high-yield experience to the masses of the whole village. After many, many jobs, the farmers' "production has reached the top thinking" was finally solved.

Under the leadership of the Party, the output of the farmers in Quzhai Village has been greatly improved in the whole village. In 1952, the average yield per mu increased by 4 dou 9 sheng 7 he compared with 1951; among them, the year-round mutual aid team increased by 4 dou 9 sheng 5 he, the Gou Faxing agricultural producers' cooperative increased by 1 shi 03 sheng 5 he; the individual households also increased by 1 dou 5 sheng 8 he. The farmers came to this conclusion from their personal experience: "Individual work is not as good as mutual assistance, cooperation is higher than mutual assistance, if you want a more happy life, communism is the goal." This conclusion summarizes the success of the Party branch in adhering to the implementation of the direction of rural economic development and carrying out propaganda and education. At the same time, all the cadres in the village have also gained an important experience from leading production, that is, the fundamental force to ensure that the countryside moves towards the road of collectivization is the leadership of the Party.

    中共长治县璩寨村支部领导工作的经验
    山西长治县璩寨村在一九四九年前，是一个工作较落后的村庄，经过这个村的支部三年来的艰苦工作，现已由落后村变为先进村，全村工作朝气勃勃稳步地向前迈进。
    一九四九年前，璩寨村党支部是一个较落后的支部，在三十二名党员中，就只苟佩芳等五个党员积极工作，其余的是：有十五人是推推动动，不推就不动，有十二人开会也叫不来。多数党员在土地改革后，滋长了“革命成功”的思想，忙于发展个人家务。如牛小秃说：“日本赶走了，地主打倒了，生活也改善了，工作该休息休息啦，生产上各自努力吧！”甚至还有人这样说：“当不当党员还不是一个样，免得开会多误工。”在自然村之间也由于历史上的关系，闹着不团结。如今这种情况已经发生了根本的变化：现有的二十九个党员中，除一个党员思想比较落后需要加紧教育外，全支部每个党员都是生龙活虎地为搞好爱国增产、互助合作而积极地工作。自然村之间已空前地团结起来了。现在有些群众对“南璩寨”“北璩寨”的这个提法都感到不顺耳了。他们说：“咱们是一个行政村，为什么叫成两个村呢？”更重要的，由于支部在党内外贯彻了农村经济发展方向的教育，逐步地引导全村群众走向了互助合作的道路。现在，全村已有百分之九十七的农户，百分之九十九的劳动力，组织到农业生产合作社和互助组里来了。他们在组织起来的基础上改进了生产技术，发挥了农业生产的潜在力，生产在逐步提高。一九五○年的农业生产指数，已达到抗日战争前最高水平的百分之一百二十，一九五一年增加到百分之一百五十一，一九五二年就迅速地增加到百分之二百零九。群众的生活也一年比一年好起来。农民们都这样说：“要不是共产党领导的这样好，那能有这个好光景。”璩寨村支部三年来由落后转变为先进，这主要是因为加强了支部的思想工作，正确地开展了批评与自我批评，并在人民群众中进行了政治教育。现将璩寨支部领导工作的经验介绍于后。
    加强思想教育工作，不断地提高
    党员的阶级觉悟
    璩寨支部是从一九五○年开始注意思想教育工作的。在此以前，支部虽经过了一九四八年的第一次整党，党员思想觉悟提高了一步，但由于整党后放松了思想领导，不久党员中的落后思想又露了头，各种工作便松懈下来。这时苟佩芳同志已从部队上退伍回来两年了，他发现了这一问题。他想：“在部队打冲锋时，都是共产党员带头，农村党员为什么不能像部队的党员一样地带头工作呢？”苟佩芳也曾一度看不起村里的党员，但是他又想到应该是帮助支部加强思想工作与组织工作，而不应采取错误态度。于是他向支部提出了在党员中进行党的基本知识教育的建议。这个建议很快为支部委员会接受了，并决定由苟佩芳担任支部教员。在结合党员的思想情况，讲解了怎样做一个共产党员以后，大部分的党员认清了共产主义的远大前途和党员的奋斗目标，在讨论中又联系批判了“革命成功”“埋头个人生产”等错误思想。程福锁在学习了“共产党员的权利与义务”后，便说：“拿这些条件和咱一对照，咱名义上是共产党员，实际上是满脑子的农民思想。”王书琴检讨说：“过去不向群众宣传党的政策，也不及时反映人民群众的要求，咱只是空挂了个党员的光荣称号。”经过这次教育，多数党员思想觉悟有了提高。同时支部也深切地体会到对党员进行经常的思想教育的重要性，全体党员也一致通过每月初一、十一、二十一日为“党员学习日”。这个学习制度一直坚持到现在，从未中断过。
    璩寨支部除了上课讲解党的基本知识外，并注意通过具体事件进行教育。例如一九五○年北璩寨村党员璩春红在拨差时偏袒本自然村的民工，支部对他的这种自私行为进行了批评。通过对这件事的讨论，不仅使璩春红本人认识了这种自私自利的做法是错误的，而且使全体党员懂得了为人民办事必须公正无私。又如在一九五一年锄麦时，支部提出发动全村将麦田普遍锄一遍时，党员张怀保看到赵龙则在街上蹓躂，就训斥赵龙则说：“你为啥不锄麦，你拿什么来抗美援朝？”赵龙则说：“你瞧！你连这也管起来了，我不锄麦碍你啥事！”当时张怀保就给赵龙则安了个帽子：“不响应政府号召，破坏锄麦任务。”两个人你一句我一句的争吵了老半天，有些群众仍然不愿意锄麦。张怀保把这件事向支部汇报了，支部当时就对张怀保所采用的强迫命令的作法提出了批评。为了教给他学习走群众路线的方法，又让他和程福锁共同去发动群众锄麦。程福锁的作法是先向群众说明天旱锄麦的好处，又说明只有加紧锄麦、多打粮食才能有力量支援志愿军的道理。经过这一讲，群众行动起来了，最后百分之百的完成了锄麦任务。张怀保在这次工作中受到了深刻的教育。支部即将程福锁与张怀保的两种不同的工作方法，在全体党员中进行了对比教育，使大家认清了强迫命令不治事，走群众路线才能完成任务。
    璩寨支部又注意了在各个中心工作中进行政策教育。一九五○年开展互助合作运动时，有些党员由于对互助合作的意义还不十分了解，因此，有的党员就不愿意参加互助合作组织。也有的虽然参加了，并不肯积极地进行领导，他们认为：“只要是个农民谁还不知道种地呢？”依据这个情况，支部就在党内进行互助合作政策的教育，并注意批判了资本主义思想。在进行教育时，并举本村开始阶级分化的事实加以说明。经过反复的思想教育以后，某些党员中幻想永远保持“小康之家”的小农经济思想就开始动摇，认识了共产党员必须坚持贯彻执行党的互助合作政策。去年春季，支部又发现有些党员，虽然参加了互助合作组织，但却不好好地搞农业生产，这时支部又组织大家学习了高岗同志一九五二年一月在中国共产党中央东北局高级干部会议上所作报告“克服资产阶级思想对党的侵蚀，反对党内的右倾思想”中的一部分“关于农村经济发展的方向问题”。明确地认识到：农村经济必须走互助合作的道路。这样互助合作运动就有了新发展。
    璩寨支部并结合各种运动，进行爱国主义与国际主义的教育。一九五一年全国开展拥护缔结和平公约、反对美国武装日本的签名、投票运动时，有部分党员不大重视这个政治斗争任务。支部即有组织地领导党员学习了有关这一问题的文章，又用最通俗的事例教育大家。经过学习和通俗地讲解签名投票的意义后，全村的人都签了名，投了票。在抗美援朝捐献飞机大炮运动中，经过党员及党的宣传员的广泛宣传，全村完成了六百六十万元的捐献任务。
    璩寨支部的教育工作方式，除上党课，开讨论会，个别教育外，还注意了运用党报来进行思想教育工作。在党员和村民中普遍组织了读报小组。支部在总结工作时，也强调地指出读报的重要；并告诉党员，工作越是繁重，学习各地的先进经验就越重要，否则忙乱一团，就不容易把工作搞好。为了把这一工作搞好，支部还成立了读报指导小组。读报指导小组的任务，是根据上级党委的指示及目前的中心工作，结合本村普遍存在的问题，指导读报组应当读那些消息，应当提出什么问题来讨论等。由于读报制度的建立，学习时事、学习先进经验就成为一种习惯，有的党员说：“报纸就是老师，一日不看报，如同迷了窍；两天不看报，什么也不知道；多日不看报，昏头转向好像睡了觉。”
    开展经常性的批评与自我
    批评，健全了党的生活
    支部把开展批评与自我批评，真正当成了支部前进的动力。璩寨支部建立这样的制度，是经过了一番斗争的。一九五○年以前，党内的批评与自我批评老是展不开。当时苟佩芳是支部的组织委员，他为了克服这种不健康的现象，也曾想过许多办法来改变这种状况，但总没有得到好的效果。开始时，他首先在支部大会上检讨自己的缺点，目的是想通过自己的检讨来启发别人。但是别的同志却你瞧我我瞧你，谁也不啃声。后来他又采用检讨自己批评别人的方法来诱导大家。一次支委会上，苟佩芳对当时的支部书记程福锁不重视支部教育工作进行了批评；当时程福锁心里热辣辣的有些受不住，但又感到苟佩芳说的有道理，也就勉强接受下来。有些党员觉得这有些“反常”，“怎么支部委员还可以批评支部书记呢？！”许怀根对璩春红说：“你还积极哩！支部书记还受到苟佩芳的批评，那能显得出你来！”党员之间为什么不能展开批评，苟佩芳在实际过程中逐渐地找到了原因。如果在党员觉悟未提高以前，当他们还不知道为什么要进行批评与自我批评的作用与目的之前，是不可能开展批评的。因此，苟佩芳又将毛主席关于批评就是扫地洗脸擦灰尘的道理，反复向大家讲解。这样大家对批评与自我批评才开始有了个正确的认识。后来又在几次党内会议上，经过多次运用之后，这个武器才为大家掌握住了。党员谷怀山（当时的村长），常常借口工作忙不参加支部会议，别人虽看出这是不对的，但也不敢向他提意见；谷怀山不在的时候，大家又吵嚷得很凶，谷怀山一来，谁也不提意见。经过学习以后，大家对他进行了批评。谷怀山因此提高了思想觉悟，积极工作，后来被选为支部组织委员。
    因为璩寨支部的批评与自我批评是紧紧地结合着各个时期的中心工作与党员的思想情况进行的，所以，它不是枯燥无味、空空洞洞的，而是有内容的、生动活泼的。这个制度就坚持下来了。
    为了发挥支部委员会集体领导的作用，支部委员之间进行了严密的分工。璩寨支部共有九个委员，苟佩芳同志被选为支部书记，负责全面领导；副支部书记杨英堂、程福锁除协助支部书记工作外，各人还负责联系一个自然村的工作；其余的支部委员，除负责党的组织工作，支部教育、宣传网、及群众组织的妇女、青年、武装治安、生产等工作外，又按全村居民分布的状况，划分为八处，每个支委分工负责一处，去和群众取得经常的联系。由于分工明确，责任清楚，这样就大大地加强了支部委员会的工作，同时也更加密切了党与群众的联系。
    带领全村群众走向爱国增产、
        互助合作的道路
    璩寨支部是怎样把群众团结在党的周围，向着党所指示的方向前进的呢？支部书记苟佩芳同志在部队上当过战斗员，也当过指挥员，他深深地懂得：要打胜仗，指挥员的正确指挥固然要紧，但是，如果不把全体战斗员的积极性发挥起来，是不可能打漂亮仗的。在组织领导群众方面，支部除了通过全体党员带领群众执行党的政策、决议外，又通过党的宣传网进行宣传。支部的宣传工作有两个制度，一是支部委员会对宣传网的领导，实行分工负责制。支委会九个委员，各个委员都固定地联系几个宣传员，宣传员又实行了包干负责制。第二是支委定期研究群众思想情况的制度。如规定了支委会每月对群众思想进行一次讨论研究，并根据上级指示订出宣传计划和宣传内容。三年来他们在各种运动中对群众的宣传工作，都是建筑在调查研究的基础上的。他们在宣传活动或日常生活中听到群众的反映，马上就汇报给支委，支委根据这些情况，提出对群众进行政治教育的意见。在一九五○年冬天抗美援朝运动中，曾因忽视政治工作，多数群众是埋头生产，不管抗美援朝；少数群众还发生了恐慌。当时，支部首先组织党员、团员、宣传员学习了中共山西省委书记赖若愚同志一九五一年的元旦广播词“必须把经济建设任务与政治斗争任务密切结合起来”。然后由党员、团员、宣传员广泛地向群众进行宣传。宣传中特别着重进行爱国主义、国际主义思想教育。除了进行上述宣传工作外，支部还推行了“爱国检查日”制度。在“爱国检查日”这天，全村家家户户要检查一次爱国公约执行情形。通过检查爱国公约来表扬好的，批评落后的。
    支部又在群众中进行了农村经济发展方向的教育，克服了少数的“生产到顶”的保守思想。苟发兴互助组发展为农业生产合作社时，组外的群众对于这个进一步走向集体化的组织充满着热情，可是也有一部分农民认为：“互助组和农业合作社是一个样。”最主要的是由于他们看到苟发兴互助组每亩地所收的粮食，已经比抗日战争前高出了一倍多，他们认为这已经“到顶”了。比如苟发兴去年计划高额丰产谷地要上二百担底肥，要打七百五十斤粮食。老农贾英贵说：“不种百亩地，难打百石粮，我活了六十岁啦，也有多上过肥的，就没见过一亩地能打千八百斤粮食；不要光吹，收下那样多才算哩。”支部在解决这个思想问题时，一面从提高生产技术、发挥农业生产上的潜在力来说服大家，一面用农民亲身经历过的事情去引导他们认识问题。最初用李顺达、郭玉恩的丰产事例来说服大家，有些人是解决了些思想问题，有些人还不大相信。后来又用本村车春兰一亩玉茭地收六百斤的事例来教育大家，这次又解决了部分人的思想问题。但是，彻底解决这个思想问题还是在去年秋天。苟发兴的农业生产合作社，经过全体社员的精耕细作，去年的高额丰产地一亩田收了九百三十五斤。打场的那一天，支部就组织全村群众进行现场参观。这天适逢“爱国检查日”，支部又组织党员苟发兴，向全村群众宣传了他们的丰产经验。经过许许多多的工作，农民的“生产到顶思想”才算得到了解决。
    璩寨村的农民，在党的领导下，全村产量都得到了大大的提高。一九五二年每亩平均产量比一九五一年提高了四斗九升七合；其中常年互助组增加了四斗九升五合，苟发兴农业生产合作社增加了一石零三升五合；单干户也增加了一斗五升八合。农民们在亲身的经历中得到了这样的结论：“单干不如互助好，合作要比互助高，要得生活更美满，共产主义是目标。”这个结论就概括地说明了党支部坚持贯彻农村经济发展方向进行宣传教育的成功。同时全村干部也从领导生产中得到了一条重要的经验，这就是——保证农村走向集体化道路的根本力量是党的领导。（本文系根据山西日报材料编写）
