Under the glorious illumination of your great ethnic policies, for the past three years, the people of all ethnic groups in Lancang County, Yunnan Province, have actively assisted the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Public Security Forces in smashing all sabotage activities by American imperialist and Kuomintang remnant bandit secret agents. In the struggle to defend the sacred border of the motherland, the people of all ethnic groups have been united as never before.

This is a great happy event that our people of all ethnic groups have not experienced in thousands of years. This is all given to us by you, and we are especially reporting this good news to you.

Respected Chairman Mao: At this time when the motherland is actively carrying out the Five-Year Economic Construction Plan, we firmly guarantee to you: our people of all ethnic groups must unite more closely in the future, strive to increase production, and strive for the complete victory in resisting America and aiding Korea; strengthen the militia joint defense armed forces, learn from the heroic fighting spirit of the Volunteer Army in Korea in attacking the American imperialist aggressors, assist the People's Liberation Army in eliminating Kuomintang secret agents, so as to defend the victorious progress of the motherland's large-scale economic construction. And under the leadership and assistance of the higher-level People's Government, we will work hard to do a good job in production, trade, culture, education, and health, and improve the lives of the people of all ethnic groups.

We firmly believe that we will be able to build Lancang into a place where people of all ethnic groups live in friendship, cooperation, prosperity, and happiness. We wish you a long life!
