    Ministry of Railways Reduces Fish Freight Rates
    To encourage the timely transportation and sale of fish and fish products, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, with the approval of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, has formulated special price measures for the transportation of fresh fish, shellfish, and salted dried fish. During the fishing season from May 1st to October 31st of this year, when fresh fish and shellfish are transported as parcels by passenger train, the freight rate will be reduced by 50% of the fresh and live parcel freight rate; when salted dried fish are transported as cargo, the freight rate will be reduced by 30% of the ordinary cargo rate. At the same time, in order to broadly develop freshwater fish farming, the railway freight for fish fry and fingerlings will also be reduced by 30% of the ordinary freight rate.
