Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 8th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India issued a statement in "Crossroads Weekly" on April 3rd, calling on the Indian people to support Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal.
    Indian public opinion continues to welcome the new proposals from the Chinese and Korean sides. The Indian Red Cross issued a communique on April 3rd, welcoming the agreement of the Chinese and Korean sides to exchange sick and wounded prisoners of war. The "Free Press" published an editorial on April 1st, stating that Zhou Enlai's proposal removed obstacles to peace. "National Herald" pointed out in an editorial on April 2nd that every concession at Panmunjom in the past was made by the Chinese and Korean sides. If the Korean armistice talks resume, it should first be attributed to the Chinese and Korean sides. "Amrita Bazar Patrika" pointed out in an editorial that the optimistic reaction to the new proposals from the Chinese and Korean sides around the world has not been seen for many years.
    According to a report from Karachi: Pakistan's "Dawn" published an editorial on April 3rd, believing that the new proposals from the Chinese and Korean sides show that the situation has undergone a significant development. "Sind Observer" published an editorial on the same day, stating that Zhou Enlai's statement has been praised worldwide.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 8th: The New York "Worker's Daily" published an editorial on April 2nd entitled "Rise Up and Demand Peace." The editorial said:
    "China has put forward a simple and clear proposal to end the Korean War. This proposal essentially removes all the excuses that have so far hindered the armistice agreement."
    The editorial condemned Washington's reluctant attitude towards this proposal, and then said: "Now the war can be stopped. It should be remembered that before this latest proposal, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai had long suggested an immediate cessation of all combat operations, and then negotiation of the remaining issues. At that time, Washington was very 'cunning' and rejected this proposal - thus, causing thousands more of our soldiers to be killed and wounded.
    "Now, China has put forward another proposal, which eliminates the last objection made by our military leaders - the so-called 'voluntary repatriation' of prisoners of war.
    "However, if the Wall Street bosses who own war industry stocks have their way, the war will not stop. They and their servants in Washington will do everything possible to sabotage this last chance for peace. That is why those whose sons are dying and those whose pockets are being emptied to fill the coffers of war profiteers must step up their actions."
    The editorial concluded: "Don't let war profiteers sabotage Korean peace! Start armistice talks immediately! No more deaths in Korea! Immediate ceasefire!"
    According to the "Worker's Daily", C. B. Baldwin, Secretary of the National Committee of the Progressive Party, demanded on April 1st that Eisenhower take immediate action on Zhou Enlai's proposal to resolve the prisoner of war issue.
    Baldwin also requested General Clark to cease all combat operations when negotiating the armistice agreement.
    The "Worker's Daily" published the full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the Korean armistice issue on March 31st.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: Paris News: The Secretariat of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a resolution of the special meeting of the National Committee of the General Confederation of Labor on the 7th. The resolution welcomed the recent proposals of the Chinese, Korean and Soviet governments to end the Korean War. The statement said: "These proposals are conducive to international reconciliation, to maintaining peace, and to the peaceful coexistence of the socialist system and the capitalist system."
    Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: Sydney News: The Melbourne "Guardian" of Australia published an editorial welcoming the new proposals of the Chinese and Korean sides regarding the Korean armistice talks. The editorial said that the attempts of the Chinese and Korean sides to overcome the obstacles to the Korean armistice created by the United States have excited people all over the world. The editorial said that world opinion is strongly opposed to the United States' plan to continue and expand the Korean War. The editorial described the sharp drop in stock prices in the capitalist world market after the Chinese and Korean proposals were put forward, and then said that this is an indirect reflection of the victory of the peace movement, and may also mean that war profiteers may take new risks if the people do not act resolutely.

    印共中央、美国“工人日报”等
    支持周总理的建议主张立即停止朝鲜战争
    【新华社新德里八日电】印度共产党中央委员会四月三日在“十字路周刊”上发表声明，号召印度人民支持周恩来总理的建议。
    印度舆论继续对中朝方面的新建议表示欢迎。印度红十字会在四月三日发表公报，对中朝方面同意交换病伤战俘表示欢迎。“自由报”在四月一日发表社论说：周恩来的建议除去了和平的障碍。“国民先驱报”在四月二日社论中指出，以往在板门店的每次让步，都是中朝方面作的。朝鲜停战谈判如果恢复，应该首先归功于中朝方面。“甘露市场报”在社论中指出，中朝方面的新建议在全世界引起的乐观反应，是多年以来所没有的。
    另据喀喇蚩消息：巴基斯坦“黎明报”在四月三日发表社论，认为中朝方面的新建议，显示形势已经有一个意义重大的发展。“信德观察报”在同一天发表社论说，周恩来的声明已得到全世界的称赞。
    【新华社布拉格八日电】纽约“工人日报”四月二日发表题为“起来要求和平”的社论。社论说：
    “中国已经提出了简单明了的结束朝鲜战争的建议。这个建议在本质上解除了迄今为止阻挠停战协定的一切藉口。”
    社论谴责华盛顿对待这个建议的勉强态度，接着说：“现在可以停止战争了。应该记得，在最近这个建议以前，中国周恩来总理早就建议立即停止一切战斗行动，然后谈判留下的问题。当时华盛顿很‘狡猾’，拒绝了这个建议——因此，使我们的士兵又死伤了几千名。
    “现在，中国又提出了建议，这个建议消除了我们的军事首脑制造的最后一个反对的借口——所谓战俘的‘自愿遣返’。
    “但是，如果让拥有战争工业股票的华尔街老板们得逞，战争就不会停止。他们与他们在华盛顿的仆从们将想尽一切办法来破坏这个实现和平的最后机会。这就是目前为什么有儿子在死亡的人与被掏尽钱袋去填满发战争财的投机家的钱库的人必须加紧行动起来的理由。”
    社论最後说：“不要让发战争财的投机家破坏朝鲜和平！立即开始停战谈判！不要在朝鲜再有死亡！立即停战！”
    据“工人日报”报道，进步党全国委员会书记克·布·鲍德温在四月一日要求艾森豪威尔对周恩来解决战俘问题的建议立即采取行动。
    鲍德温并要求克拉克将军，在谈判停战协定时，停止一切战斗行动。
    “工人日报”在三月三十一日全文刊载了周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战问题的声明。
    【新华社八日讯】巴黎消息：法国总工会书记处在七日发表了总工会全国委员会特别会议的一项决议。这个决议表示欢迎中国，朝鲜和苏联政府最近关于结束朝鲜战争的建议。声明说：“这些建议有助于国际和解，有助于保持和平，并且有助于社会主义制度和资本主义制度和平共处。”
    【新华社八日讯】悉尼消息：澳大利亚墨尔本“卫报”发表社论，欢迎中朝方面关于朝鲜停战谈判的新建议。社论说，中朝方面在克服美国所制造的朝鲜停战障碍方面的尝试，使全世界人民都感到兴奋。社论说，全世界舆论都强烈反对美国继续和扩大朝鲜战争的计划。社论叙述了中朝建议提出以后资本主义世界市场股票价格猛跌的情形，接着说，这是和平运动胜利的间接反映，同时也许意味着发战争财者可能作新的冒险，假如人民不坚决行动的话。
