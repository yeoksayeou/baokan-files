    The Twenty-Year Knot Untied
    —A Record of Volunteer Soldier's Family Member Yang Zhilin's Harmonious Family
    Yu Zi
    On March 15th, the family of Yang Zhilin, a family member of a Volunteer soldier in Baishiqiao, Hankou, happily ate "Reunion Celebration Wine," celebrating the victory on the Korean front, celebrating the achievements of father Yang Zhilin's work with military family members, and celebrating mother Peng Shunan's award as "Glorious Teacher," and even more so celebrating the untying of a twenty-year knot in the family.
    Twenty years ago, Yang Zhilin remarried Peng Shunan, who was fifteen years younger than him, because his wife passed away due to illness, leaving behind his ten-year-old child Yang Jin, who had no one to care for him. When twenty-year-old Peng Shunan entered the Yang family, she had to raise a ten-year-old boy. Firstly, she had no experience, and secondly, she lacked patience, so a mother-son relationship was never established. Later, Peng Shunan herself gave birth to two sons in succession. The young woman was overwhelmed with taking care of the newborn children, and she was relatively negligent towards the older child. Yang Jin thought his stepmother was biased, and from junior high school onwards, he did not speak to this mother and rarely played with his two younger brothers, Yang Du and Yang Guang. Thus, for twenty years, the Yang family had lived an unhappy life.
    Yang Jin got married and lived outside, only returning home on Sundays for a simple meal. Later, when he had more children, he moved back. His wife and mother-in-law often argued over trivial household matters. The mother-in-law blamed her husband for not being fair and for the whole family ganging up on her, so in a fit of pique, she abandoned household chores, found a job teaching in a primary school, and moved into the school to live. Yang Du and Yang Guang, who were studying at school, also rarely returned home. The family was torn apart.
    After liberation, Yang Jin worked as an accountant in a grain company, his wife Xiao Biying worked as a statistician in a cooperative, Yang Du was about to graduate from high school, Yang Guang was in junior high school, the mother-in-law was still teaching primary school, and Yang Zhilin was at home taking care of household affairs. In the early days of liberation, the whole family had once moved back in to eat and live together, but within three months, they had quarreled again, the mother-in-law had moved back to the school, and the sons and daughters-in-law had moved back to their workplaces. Only on Sundays would the old man prepare a few dishes, and everyone would come back for a meal, and then leave again. In such a family situation, the old man became more depressed day by day, and his health deteriorated day by day. In the year Yang Du graduated from high school, he signed up to join the Volunteer Army and went to Korea. Although Yang Zhilin was happy and served as the head of the military family members' group and health committee in the neighborhood, he didn't have much energy because the family knot hadn't been untied, and he always felt like he had a heavy burden on his shoulders.
    The sacred struggle to resist America and aid Korea tempered Yang Du and also tempered his family. Leaving his country and defending it, he cared about the progress of his country and also cared about the unity of his family. The letters he sent from the front lines in Korea were sent separately to his father, mother, older brother, sister-in-law, and younger brother, warming the old man's heart and also educating and moving everyone in the family. Could he allow those on the front lines to worry about the disunity of the family? The people of the whole world must unite to oppose the American aggressors. Why should a family of close relatives be torn apart like this? Everyone in the family was planning to improve family unity, but they all felt that it had been too long and the root was too deep, and some things were not easy to explain at once, so they procrastinated again.
    After the campaign to publicize the Marriage Law was launched nationwide, the eldest son and daughter-in-law in the Yang family studied at their workplaces, the mother-in-law participated in school studies, and the father held four or five residents' symposiums and military family members' symposiums in the neighborhood. They couldn't procrastinate any longer; everyone was trying to find a good opportunity to open up. This year, March 15th was the mother-in-law Peng Shunan's fortieth birthday. Seizing this opportunity, the daughter-in-law discussed with Yang Jin about giving the mother-in-law some gifts. The daughter-in-law said: The mother-in-law's lecture bag is broken, and her shoes are old, so I will buy her a leather bag and a pair of shoes. Yang Jin said: Mom spends a lot of energy teaching, so I will buy her three bottles of milk powder. After the couple discussed it, they went to ask the father for his opinion. This was an unprecedented move in twenty years. Yang Zhilin immediately ran to the school to tell his wife the news. Peng Shunan was so moved that she shed tears and said, "Although my son and daughter-in-law have some shortcomings, I am also wrong. My son and daughter-in-law are progressing faster than me." Thinking of this, she also felt relieved. The old couple discussed preparing a few dishes this Sunday (February 8th), calling Yang Guang home as well, and preparing to have a "heart-to-heart meal" with the whole family.
    After school on February 7th, Peng Shunan returned home. The next day, they got up very early, and the old couple went to the market to buy groceries. The father said: Yang Jin likes to eat braised beef, let's buy some beef. The mother-in-law said: The daughter-in-law loves to eat mandarin fish, so let's buy a large mandarin fish as well. Yang Jin and his wife also returned home especially early that day. Yang Jin took the initiative to tidy up the flowers and trees in the courtyard that had been neglected for several years, and his wife helped his mother-in-law cook. After Yang Guang returned home, the brothers talked intimately for the first time. At lunchtime, although the family did not say much, they unprecedentedly ate a happy meal. After the meal, the daughter-in-law specially gave each of her father-in-law, mother-in-law, and younger brother a cup of tea, which moved the mother-in-law's heart even more. The son and father, the daughter-in-law and mother-in-law, all opened up to each other. Especially after the daughter-in-law and mother-in-law had a cordial conversation and sincerely admitted their mistakes, they were both so moved that they shed tears, and they both said: The old society harmed us for twenty years, and everyone suffered. From now on, we must live in harmony and let our younger brother on the front lines be at ease killing the enemy. At this time, Yang Guang also led his three nephews to play in the yard for the first time.
    After such a heart-to-heart meeting, everyone's burdens were completely lifted, and their enthusiasm for work and study was improved. Yang Zhilin's frowning face now often wears a happy smile, and he is working even more enthusiastically as a family member of a soldier. At the Marriage Law study meeting in her workplace, the daughter-in-law Xiao Biying reported on her initial process of harmonizing the family, reviewed her own mistakes, and at the same time encouraged others to harmonize their families and challenged others! The mother-in-law Peng Shunan's work in the school has always been active, and now it is even more active. She not only used her own practical example to persuade and convince all the teachers in the school, but also investigated the family situations of the students, encouraged the students to persuade their parents to be harmonious, and personally went to the students' homes to educate others with her own experiences, explaining the pain of family disharmony and the happiness after harmony. In this way, she personally helped improve the relationships of three families. Because of her active work, all the teachers and students in the school unanimously gave Peng Shunan the title of "Glorious Teacher" and decided to elect representatives to send a banner of "Glorious Teacher" to her home on her fortieth birthday. At this time, the second son Yang Du sent a letter from the Korean front, congratulating his mother on her birthday, greeting his father, and also reporting his achievements, saying that he had received praise. Around March 10th, Yang Jin, Xiao Biying, and Peng Shunan all moved back home to eat and live together.
    On March 15th, the Yang family, from the gate to the courtyard to the living room, was crowded with people. Representatives from the grain company, the cooperative, and the school, representatives of military family members, heads of residents' groups, members of the neighborhood committee, civil affairs cadres from the street government, relatives and friends of the Yang family all came to congratulate the Yang family on their achievements and express their joy. Yang Zhilin and Peng Shunan felt even happier and sweeter than when they were newly married. When the representatives of the Young Pioneers, with smiles on their faces, presented the banner of "Glorious Teacher" and congratulated the teacher on her birthday and celebrated the achievements of her older brother Yang Du on the front lines, Peng Shunan seemed to see the smile of her son on the front lines, as if she heard her son saying to her: "Mom, I congratulate you!"

    二十年的疙瘩解开了
    ——记志愿军军属杨之林的和睦家庭
    羽子
    三月十五日，汉口白石桥志愿军军属杨之林一家喜洋洋的，吃着“团圆贺功酒”，庆贺朝鲜前线的胜利，庆贺爹爹杨之林军属工作的成就和妈妈彭淑南荣获“光荣老师”的称号，更庆贺一家二十年的疙瘩解开了。
    二十年前，杨之林因妻子患病去世，留下十岁的孩子杨进没有人照料，他就和比他小十五岁的彭淑南结了婚。二十岁的彭淑南一进杨家就要抚养一个十岁的男孩，一来她没有经验，二来年轻没有耐心，母子情感始终没有建立起来。以后，彭淑南自己也连续生了两个男孩子。年青的妇女刚做妈妈，照料初生的小孩就忙得不可开交，对于大孩子就比较疏忽一些。杨进就以为后母偏心，从初中起他就不和这位母亲说话，也很少和两个弟弟杨度和杨光在一起玩。这样，二十年来杨家一直过着不愉快的生活。
    杨进结婚了，一直住在外面，只星期天回家打打牙祭。后来，孩子生多了，才搬回来。媳妇和婆婆又因为一些家务小事经常吵架。婆婆怪爹爹不主持公道，全家合起来欺负她一个人，一气之下，就丢开家务，找了个小学去教书，并且搬进学校去住了。在学校读书的杨度和杨光也很少回家。一家搞得四分五裂。
    解放以后，杨进在粮食公司作会计，媳妇萧碧英在合作社作统计，杨度高中快毕业了，杨光住初中，婆婆仍教小学，杨之林在家主持家务。解放初期全家曾经都搬回来食宿，可是不到三个月又吵翻了，婆婆又搬进学校，儿子媳妇又搬进机关。只到了星期天，老头子准备了几样菜，大家回来打个牙祭，吃完了又都走了。在这样的家庭情况下，老头子一天苦闷一天，身体一天坏一天。杨度在高中毕业那年报名参加志愿军到朝鲜去了。杨之林虽然高兴，在街道上也担任了军属组长和卫生委员，但是因为家庭的疙瘩没解开，劲头总不大，肩上总像压着千斤重担似的。
    抗美援朝的神圣斗争锻炼了杨度，也锻炼了他的家庭。离开祖国，保卫着祖国的他，关怀着祖国的进步，也关怀着他家庭的团结。他在朝鲜前线寄来的信件，分别寄给父亲、母亲、哥哥、嫂嫂和弟弟，温暖了老人的心，也教育和感动了全家所有的人。能够叫前线的人挂念着家庭的不团结吗？全世界的人民都要团结起来反对美国侵略者，一家亲骨肉，为什么要闹得这样四分五裂呢？全家的人都在打算要搞好家庭团结，但是又都觉得时间太久，根子太深，有些话一时说不清，因此又拖了下来。
    宣传婚姻法的运动在全国范围开展后，杨家大儿子和媳妇在机关学习，婆婆参加学校学习，爹爹在街道一连开了四、五次居民座谈会和军属座谈会。不能再拖下去了，大家都在想法子找一个好开口的机会。今年三月十五日是婆婆彭淑南四十岁生日。抓住这个当口，媳妇就和杨进商量送点礼物给婆婆。媳妇说：婆婆挟讲义的皮包破了，脚上鞋子旧了，我给她买一个皮包和一双鞋。杨进说：妈妈教书很费精力，我买牛奶粉三瓶送给她老人家。夫妻俩商量好之后又去向爹爹征求意见。这是二十年来从未有过的举动，杨之林听了以后马上跑到学校去把这个消息告诉妻子。彭淑南感动得流泪说：“儿子、媳妇虽然有些缺点，但是我也不对。儿子、媳妇比我进步得快。”想到这里，她心里也开朗了。老俩口商量在这个星期天（二月八日）办几样菜，把杨光也叫回家，准备全家吃个“谈心饭”。
    二月七日放了学，彭淑南回了家。第二天起个绝早，老俩口上街买菜。爹爹说：杨进喜欢吃红烧牛肉，买些牛肉吧。婆婆说：媳妇爱吃桂鱼，也买了
    一尾大桂鱼。杨进小俩口这天回家也特别早，杨进主动把院中荒了几年的花木整理起来，媳妇帮忙婆婆做饭。杨光回家后，兄弟俩第一次亲密地谈起话来。吃午饭的时候，一家人虽然说话不多，但却破天荒地吃了一顿高兴饭。饭后媳妇特地给爹爹、婆婆和弟弟分别送了一杯茶，更感动了婆婆的心。儿子和父亲、媳妇和婆婆都谈开了。尤其是媳妇和婆婆经过一番亲切的谈话和虚心的互相认错之后，都感动得流下泪来，都说：旧社会害了我们二十年，大家都苦恼。今后要和和气气过日子，叫弟弟在前线也安心杀敌。这时杨光也第一次引着三个侄儿到院中玩耍去了。
    经过这样一个谈心会，大家心头的包袱全卸了下来，工作和学习的劲头都提高了。杨之林愁眉不展的脸，现在常常挂上愉快的微笑，干军属工作更起劲了。媳妇萧碧英在机关婚姻法学习会上报告了自己初步和睦家庭的经过，检讨了自己的错误，同时鼓励别人和睦家庭，向别人挑战！婆婆彭淑南在学校的工作一向是积极的，现在更积极了。她不但用自己的现实例子向全校教师进行宣传说服，也调查学生们的家庭情况，鼓励学生劝说父母和睦，自己亲自去到学生家里用自己的事情教育别人，说明家庭不和睦的痛苦和和睦以后的幸福。就是这样，在她亲自帮助之下改善了三个家庭的关系。由于她的工作积极，全校教师和学生一致送给彭淑南“光荣老师”的称号，并决定在她四十岁生日的时候推选代表送一幅“光荣老师”的锦旗到她家里去。正在这时，二儿子杨度从朝鲜前线来了信，一面向妈妈祝寿，向父亲问安，同时也报告自己的战绩，说到自己受到了表扬。三月十日前后，杨进、萧碧英、彭淑南都搬回家来食宿了。
    三月十五日，杨家从大门到院子，连客堂里到处挤满了人。粮食公司、合作社、学校的代表，军属代表，居民组长，街道委员，街政府民政干事，杨家的亲戚、朋友，都来给杨家庆功贺喜。杨之林、彭淑南感到比新婚的时候还高兴和甜蜜。当红领巾的少年儿童队员的代表满面笑容地献上了“光荣老师”的锦旗，并向老师祝寿和庆贺前线杨度哥哥的战绩时，彭淑南像看到在前线的儿子的笑容，像听到儿子在向着她说：“妈妈，我恭贺你！”
