    Tokyo News: Yamada Zenjiro, who used to be a cook in an American intelligence agency and exposed the atrocities of American special agents imprisoning the Japanese writer Kaji Wataru, delivered a speech on behalf of the "Kaji Yamada Relief Association" at the Japan People's Conference for Peace on March 22, exposing the American crime of illegally transporting captured Chinese and Korean personnel to Japan to carry out special training in order to force them to serve as spies. Recalling what he had witnessed, he said: "In November 1951, I was taken by American-Japanese Warrant Officer Ito Shoichi to a house taken over at 740 Shibuya Ward. There were twenty captured Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers and one hundred captured Korean People's Army soldiers detained there. The Americans tattooed the words 'Anti-Communist' and 'Die for Christ' on their wrists. American intelligence agencies forced them to undergo parachute and espionage training. After the training, the 'anti-communist' tattoo was changed to a 'cherry blossom' tattoo. The captured Chinese and Korean personnel resented this immensely. I personally saw them use razors to cut off their skin and use tissue paper to stop the bleeding. They were confined in small rooms like luggage and hung on three-tiered beds. As an employee of the occupying forces, I was forbidden to talk to them. However, I took the opportunity to speak with Pan Jie from Lianghu Village, Pingding County, Shanxi Province, China. I promised him that I would find a way to notify his country of this fact. But I have never been able to do so. Today, I would like to accuse everyone of this crime and ask you to rescue these prisoners of war." His exposure aroused great indignation among all the peace representatives, and the conference passed a resolution protesting against the American atrocities of forcibly tattooing and conducting espionage training on captured Chinese People's Volunteers and Korean People's Army soldiers.
    On April 1, at the "Memorial Service for the Chinese Martyrs of the Hanaoka Incident" held at Asakusa Honganji Temple in Tokyo by organizations such as the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, and representatives of Chinese residents in Japan, Yamada Zenjiro exposed with the same facts the crime of the American aggressors using so-called "voluntary repatriation" to forcibly detain prisoners of war and illegally transport these prisoners of war to Tokyo for persecution.

    山田善二郎在日本人民争取和平大会上
    揭露美国强运中朝战俘赴日加以迫害的罪行
    【本报讯】东京消息：曾在美国特务机关做过厨师、揭露了美国特务机关幽禁日本作家鹿地亘的暴行的山田善二郎，三月二十二日代表“鹿地山田救援会”在日本人民争取和平大会上致词时，揭露了美国把中朝被俘人员非法押运日本施行特务训练以强迫他们充当间谍的罪行。他追述曾经目睹的情况说：“一九五一年十一月，我被美籍日人伊藤正一准尉带到澁谷区七四零号接收来的房子去过。在那里关有二十名中国人民志愿军被俘人员及一百名朝鲜人民军被俘人员。这些人的手腕上被美国人刺上‘反共’、‘为基督而死’的字样。美国情报机关曾强迫他们接受跳伞和间谍训练。训练完毕，便把‘反共’的刺字改变成‘樱’的刺字。中朝被俘人员对此无限愤恨，我亲眼看见他们用剃刀将皮肤削下来，以手纸堵住鲜血。他们好像行李一般被关在狭小的屋子里的并吊在三层的床上。作为进驻军雇员的我，是被禁止与他们交谈的。但是我乘隙曾与中国山西省平定县良浒村人叫潘杰的攀谈过。我答应他一定设法将这种事实通知他的国家。但是我一直未能那样做。今天我特向大家控诉这种罪恶行为，请大家把这些战俘救出来。”他的揭露激起全体和平代表的极大愤慨，大会为此通过了一项决定，抗议美国对中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军被俘人员施行强迫刺字及间谍训练等暴行。
    四月一日，在日本红十字会、日本和平联络委员会等团体和中国旅日侨民代表在东京浅草本愿寺举行的“花冈殉难中国烈士追悼大会”上，山田善二郎以同样事实揭露美国侵略者用所谓“自愿遣返”来强迫扣留战俘、并把这些战俘非法运到东京加以迫害的罪恶行为。
