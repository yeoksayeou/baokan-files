Xinhua News Agency: Under the American monopoly capital's enslavement, the economic situation in the Philippines is becoming increasingly serious. Calls for the abolition of the enslaving US-Philippine trade agreement are constantly rising in the Philippines. The Philippine puppet government recently had to make demands on its American masters to relax economic constraints. Philippine President Quirino telegraphed US President Eisenhower on March 29, suggesting amending the US-Philippine trade agreement and requesting immediate "negotiations."

The US-Philippine trade agreement (Bell Trade Act) was one of the conditions attached by the United States when it bestowed "independence" on the Philippines, and it came into effect in 1946. According to this agreement, American goods can be imported into the Philippines duty-free without any restrictions, while Philippine exports to the United States are subject to restrictions. Since the signing of this enslaving agreement, the Philippines' foreign trade has changed from a regular surplus before the war to a yearly deficit. The deficit figure for 1952 reached 147.7 million Philippine pesos.

American goods flood the Philippine market, destroying many Philippine national enterprises. Taking the cigarette industry as an example, in this world-famous Luzon tobacco producing area, massive dumping of American cigarettes and tobacco is squeezing out the Philippine cigarette industry and severely hitting tobacco farmers. In 1952, tobacco harvests in Isabela and Cagayan provinces were reduced by half. Workers were laid off in large numbers. Tens of thousands of farmers went bankrupt.

The American enslaving trade agreement also binds the Philippines' foreign trade to a one-sided relationship with the United States. The exchange rate of two pesos to one dollar, which the trade agreement stipulates can only be changed with the approval of the US President, makes it difficult for most countries lacking US dollars to purchase Philippine products. Duty-free American imports monopolize the Philippine market, and goods from other countries that are lower in price and higher in quality cannot be imported into the Philippines for sale, making it extremely difficult for the Philippines to conduct multilateral trade. At the same time, the United States arbitrarily lowers the prices of Philippine raw materials by virtue of its monopoly position.

Under the cruel exploitation of American monopoly capital, the Philippine people are becoming increasingly poor, purchasing power is constantly declining, production is greatly reduced, and foreign trade is seriously shrinking.

Copra, one of the Philippines' main products, saw a production decrease of more than 100,000 tons in 1952 compared to 1951. A bulletin from the Philippine Department of Agriculture predicts that copra production will continue to decline in 1953. According to the Philippine Bureau of Census and Statistics, the total value of foreign trade in January 1953 decreased by 36 percent compared to January 1952. The Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, Mr. Cuaderno, recently admitted: "If the Philippines does not amend its trade agreement with the United States, the Philippine economy will face collapse."

### 在美国垄断资本的残酷剥削下  菲律宾的经济面临崩溃

    在美国垄断资本的残酷剥削下
    菲律宾的经济面临崩溃
    【新华社讯】在美国垄断资本奴役下的菲律宾的经济情况，已越来越严重。要求废除奴役性的美菲贸易协定的呼声，在菲律宾正在不断高涨。菲律宾傀儡政府最近也不得不向美国主子提出了放松经济束缚的要求。菲律宾总统季里诺三月二十九日打电报给美国总统艾森豪威尔，建议修改美菲贸易协定，并要求立即进行“谈判”。
    美菲贸易协定（贝尔法案）是美国在恩赐菲律宾“独立”时订定的附带条件之一，于一九四六年起开始实施。根据这个协定，美国货可以不受任何限制地免税输入菲律宾，而菲律宾对美国的输出却要受限制。自从这个奴役性的协定签订后，菲律宾的对外贸易便从战前的经常出超变成年年入超。一九五二年的入超数字达到菲币一亿四千七百七十万比索。
    美国货泛滥着菲律宾市场，摧毁了不少菲律宾的民族企业。以制烟业作例子，在这个世界著名的吕宋烟产地，大量倾销的美国香烟和烟草正在排挤菲律宾的制烟业和严重地打击烟农。一九五二年怡沙迷拉省和嘉牙鄢省的烟草收成减少了一半。工人大批失业。成千成万的农民破产。
    美国的奴役性贸易协定同时还把菲律宾的对外贸易束缚在与美国单方面的联系上。贸易协定规定的须经过美国总统批准才能改变的二比索兑一美元的外汇率，使得多数缺乏美元的国家很难购买菲律宾的物产。免税进口的美国货垄断了菲律宾市场，其他国家价格低而质量高的货品也不能输进菲律宾销售，这就使得菲律宾极难进行多边贸易。美国同时凭借它的垄断地位任意压低菲律宾原料的价格。
    在美国垄断资本的残酷剥削下，菲律宾人民越来越贫穷，购买力不断下降，生产大大减少，对外贸易严重萎缩了。
    菲律宾最主要的物产之一——椰干，一九五二年生产量比一九五一年减少了十万吨以上。菲律宾农业部的公报预料：一九五三年的椰干生产还要继续下降。据菲律宾调查统计局公布：一九五三年一月的对外贸易总额比一九五二年一月减少了百分之三十六。菲律宾中央银行行长卡德诺不久前承认：“如果菲律宾不修改它和美国订下的贸易协定，菲律宾的经济将面临崩溃。”
