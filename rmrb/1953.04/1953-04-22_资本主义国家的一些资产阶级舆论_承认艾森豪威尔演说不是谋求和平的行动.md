Some Bourgeois Public Opinion in Capitalist Countries
Acknowledges Eisenhower's Speech Was Not an Action Seeking Peace
(Xinhua News Agency, 21st) After Eisenhower delivered his speech on the 16th, some bourgeois public opinion in capitalist countries also admitted that Eisenhower's speech was not a constructive action seeking peace.
    In Britain, a major "ally" of the United States, Labour Party leader Bevan delivered a speech on the 19th criticizing Eisenhower's speech, saying: "General Eisenhower's response to some of Moscow's remarks was very poorly worded. The advice given to him was very bad. If you want reconciliation, you can't have everything without being willing to give way a little. If you insist that the Soviet Union accept all the humiliating conditions while you are not willing to give way at all, you will not get world peace."
    The "Manchester Guardian" editorial on the 17th also said: "Eisenhower has set a high price… but he has not said what the Western countries will have to do and must do to get these things."
    Labour MP Desmond Donnelly emphasized in a speech on the 19th that to seek a peaceful resolution to world problems, one should "begin with limited agreements on the Korean armistice and other issues," "rather than threats and demands."
    In France, another major "ally" of the United States, "Combat" commented: "The conditions put forward by Eisenhower are very similar to those announced at the time of a great war victory."
    In Japan, under the direct control of the United States, Agence France-Presse quoted an editorial in the "Asahi Shimbun" saying that Eisenhower's proposal "did not contain concessions from the American side, but only demanded concessions from the Soviet side." The editorial pointed out that the "conditions" put forward by Eisenhower were no different from what the United States had discussed in the past.

    资本主义国家的一些资产阶级舆论
    承认艾森豪威尔演说不是谋求和平的行动
    【新华社二十一日讯】艾森豪威尔十六日发表演说后，资本主义国家的某些资产阶级舆论也承认艾森豪威尔的演说并非谋求和平的建设性行动。
    在美国主要的“盟国”英国，工党领袖之一比万十九日发表演说，批评艾森豪威尔的演说说：“艾森豪威尔将军对莫斯科的某些言论的答复是措辞很不好的。顾问给他的帮助是很坏的。如果你要和解，你便不能一切都要，而自己又不愿退让一点。如果你坚持要苏联接受全部侮辱性的条件，而自己根本不愿退让一点，你是得不到世界和平的。”
    “曼彻斯特卫报”十七日社论也说：“艾森豪威尔提出了高价……但是他并未说出西方国家为了要得到这些东西而要做的和不得不做的一切事情。”
    工党议员德斯蒙德·唐纳利在十九日发表的演说里强调：要求得世界问题的和平解决，应该“以朝鲜停战和其他问题上的有限度的协议开始”，“而不是威胁和要求。”
    在美国的另外一个主要“盟国”法国，“战斗报”的评论说：“艾森豪威尔提出的那些条件很像大战胜利时发表的那些条件。”
    在美国直接控制下的日本，据法新社引“朝日新闻”发表的社论说：艾森豪威尔的建议“并没有美国方面的让步，而只要求苏联方面作让步”。社论指出，艾森豪威尔所提出的“条件”和美国以往所谈论的并无区别。
