    An'guang Grain Bureau's Chaotic Shipping System Results in Grain Being Shipped Without a Recipient
    A letter from Liu Suzhi of the Dezhou Prefectural Grain Bureau, Shandong Province: On March 5th, three train cars of corn (totaling 93 tons) from the An'guang Grain Bureau of Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China, arrived at the Dezhou Railway Station. The shipping manifest listed the recipient as "Dezhou Grain Bureau, Hebei Province" (Note: This is obviously a mistake for Shandong Province). However, our Dezhou Grain Bureau has no plan for receiving this batch of grain. The Dezhou Railway Bureau's Freight Office repeatedly telegraphed the An'guang Grain Bureau, asking them to clarify the actual recipient; however, the An'guang Grain Bureau did not seem to care about this batch of grain, so that by March 30th, the recipient still could not be found. This batch of grain has been held at the station for too long, and not only is it subject to a storage fee of over 2.8 million yuan, but it has also started to mold and spoil. In order to prevent further loss of state property, our Dezhou Grain Bureau has taken over the grain and recorded it into our accounts. The chaotic shipping system and the uncaring attitude towards state property displayed by the An'guang Grain Bureau are intolerable. They should quickly investigate and correct this error, and expedite the handling of this batch of grain.

    安广粮食局发货制度混乱运出粮食竟找不到收货者
    山东德州专署粮食局刘肃之来信：三月五日，东北黑龙江省安广粮食局有三车玉米（共九十三吨）运到德州车站，发货单上写的收货单位是“河北省（按：显系山东省之误）德州粮食局”。但我们德州粮食局根本没有这批来粮的计划。德州铁路局货运室就连续发电报给安广粮食局，请他们查明收粮单位究竟是何处；安广粮食局却并不关心这批粮食，以致直到三月三十日，这批粮食还找不到收货单位。这批粮食在车站积压过久，不但按规定应罚保管费二百八十多万元；并且已有发霉变质现象。我们德州粮食局为了不使国家财产继续遭受损失，已把这批粮食代为接收入账。安广粮食局这种发货制度的混乱情况和对国家财产不关心的态度是令人不能容忍的。他们应该迅速检查纠正这种错误，并赶快处理这批粮食。
