Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 24th: The Soviet people solemnly commemorate the 83rd anniversary of the birth of the great Lenin (April 23rd). Factories, collective farms, institutions, and schools across the country have held seminars and reports on Lenin's life and work, and on the great cooperation between Lenin and Stalin. In Moscow, thousands of people visit the Lenin Central Museum every day. Workers, collective farmers, office workers, and students carefully view the manuscripts, photos, books, and documents related to the history of the Soviet Communist Party and to Lenin's life and work exhibited there. In Leningrad—the place where Lenin and his great comrade-in-arms Stalin prepared and led the October Socialist Revolution and delivered speeches to thousands of workers—a large number of working people participated in lectures and reports about Lenin. Forty people at the Neva Machine Building Factory delivered reports and lectures about Lenin. Many excursion teams visited the former Smolny Institute, the headquarters of the October Revolution, where the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets was held, and where Lenin announced the first decree of the Soviet government—the Decree on Peace. In Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, people held an exhibition about Lenin. These days, many people have visited the Avlabar Secret Printing House organized by Stalin in Tbilisi in 1903. At that time, revolutionary workers printed the works of Lenin and Stalin in this place deep underground, out of the sight of the police. In Kazan, where Lenin studied and began his revolutionary activities, various departments of Kazan University held seminars on the great Lenin. Lectures, exhibitions, and commemorative gatherings commemorating Lenin's birthday were also held in many places in Ukraine, Belarus, Central Asia, and the Baltic republics.
