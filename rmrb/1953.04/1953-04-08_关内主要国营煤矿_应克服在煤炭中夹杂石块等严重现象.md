Major State-Owned Coal Mines Within the Customs Should Overcome the Serious Phenomenon of Coal Being Mixed with Stones

The coal produced by major state-owned coal mines within the customs contains a serious amount of stones and gangue.

According to statistics from the Shanghai branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, out of the more than 7.24 million tons of coal transported to Shanghai by various mines in the past three years, more than 99,000 tons were stones and gangue. This caused a loss of approximately 13.744 billion yuan in national property in terms of operations. The handling of the more than 20,000 tons of stones and gangue that had been picked out also caused many difficulties, with losses in labor and intra-city transportation alone reaching 6.09 billion yuan. These stones and gangue, mixed in with good coal and transported from mines thousands of miles away to Shanghai, were mostly used to fill sites by certain units, except for a very small portion that was sold at half price after being manually picked and peeled.

According to the company's analysis of the historical quality of domestically produced coal, the stone content of coal sold in Shanghai before the Anti-Japanese War was: Kailuan coal about 0.3%, Huainan coal 0.5%, Datong coal 0.5%, Zhongxing coal (i.e., Taozhuang coal) 0.5%, and Jiawang coal 0.4%. This is because all these coals were sorted and shipped by the mines at the time of sale. After liberation, the enthusiasm of workers for production greatly increased, and the output of various mines increased, but this also led to a bias towards neglecting quality. In August 1951, the company conducted tests on various types of coal and found that the stone content in lump coal was: Kailuan No. 2 coal 3.95%, Huainan coal 2.25%, Datong coal 2.05%, Zhongxing coal 8.05%, and Jiawang coal 5.3%, while the gangue in Yangquan lump coal was as high as 12.75%. Although individual coal types have improved somewhat in certain periods, the amount of gangue contained is still serious. For example, the stone content of Yangquan coal, Kailuan No. 2 coal, Datong coal, Boshan coal, and Huainan coal sometimes reaches more than 10%.

The excessive stone content of coal has greatly affected industrial production. Because stones and gangue themselves cannot burn, they not only increase the number of ash removals in the furnace, but also block air entry, reduce firepower, and increase the output of defective products and waste products in many factories. For example, the Zhonghui Glass Factory can produce good glass with 10 tons of pure coal in four hours, but if coal containing stones is used, it requires 12 tons and five hours, and the product is not thoroughly fired within the specified time, resulting in unclear color and a waste rate of 10%. Another example is the Zhonghua Copper Factory, which used coal containing stones to melt two tons of copper on November 20, 1952. As a result, compared with using pure coal, labor was wasted by 20%, the product was reduced by 10%, and the specified furnace time was exceeded, resulting in 10% waste products. The zinc added to the copper was completely ineffective due to oxidation.

The China Coal Industry Building Materials Company has repeatedly requested the production departments to improve this situation in order to avoid losses of national property, but no definite and effective solution has been obtained to date. The production departments should work with the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, which directly manages coal, to jointly study and quickly take practical and effective measures to prevent or reduce the phenomenon of stones and gangue being mixed in with coal.

### 关内主要国营煤矿  应克服在煤炭中夹杂石块等严重现象

    关内主要国营煤矿
    应克服在煤炭中夹杂石块等严重现象
    关内主要国营煤矿生产的煤炭中，夹杂石块、僵石的现象严重。
    根据中国煤业建筑器材公司上海市公司的统计：该公司过去三年中由各矿运上海的七百二十四万余吨煤中，石块与僵石达九万九千余吨，造成国家财产在经营上的损失约一百三十七亿四千余万元；在已拣出的二万余吨石块、僵石的处理上也发生了好多困难，仅人工与市内运输等损失即达六十亿九千余万元。这些从几千里外的矿区混在好煤内运进上海的石块和僵石，除极少部分经过人工拣剥后按成本一半贬价出售外，大部分均交某些单位填充了场地。
    根据该公司对国内产煤的历史质量分析结果，上海市在抗日战争以前所销煤炭的含石成分是：开滦煤约千分之三，淮南煤千分之五，大同煤千分之五，中兴煤（即陶庄煤）千分之五，贾汪煤千分之四。因为这些煤在当时都是矿上在出售时经过拣选后运出的。解放后职工生产积极性大为提高，各矿产量增加，但由此也产生了忽视质量的偏向，在一九五一年八月份，该公司曾将多种煤炭进行试验，发现在块煤中的含石成分是：开滦二号煤百分之三·九五，淮南煤百分之二·二五，大同煤百分之二·○五，中兴煤百分之八·○五，贾汪煤百分之五·三，而阳泉块煤中的僵石竟达百分之十二·七五。目前个别煤种在一定时期内虽有些改进，但以所含僵石数量来说，仍然严重。如阳泉煤、开滦二号煤、大同煤、博山煤及淮南煤的含石量，有时竟达百分之十以上。
    由于煤炭含石过多，使工业生产受到很大影响。因为石块、僵石本身不能燃烧，因此在炉中不但增加出灰次数，并阻塞空气进入，减少火力，使很多工厂增加了次货和废品的产量。如中汇玻璃厂用纯煤十吨在四小时内即可出良好的玻璃，若用含石煤炭则需十二吨与五个小时，且产品因不能在规定时间内烧透，色泽不明，废品率达百分之十；又如中华铜厂在一九五二年十一月二十日熔铜两吨中，用含石煤炭结果，较用纯煤在人工上浪费百分之二十，产品则减少百分之十，且超过了规定出炉时间，出废品百分之十，加入铜中之锌因发生氧化全部失去作用。
    中国煤业建筑器材公司曾多次向生产部门要求改进此种情况，以避免国家财产损失，但迄今尚未得到确切有效的解决。生产部门应与直接经营煤炭的中国煤业建筑器材公司协同研究，迅速采取切实有效措置，防止或减少在煤炭中夹杂石块、僵石的现象。
