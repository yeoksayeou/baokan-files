Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 17th: Our correspondent reports: In the battle for a certain height near Yandong-ri northwest of Mundeng-ri on the eastern front, casualties of the Li pseudo-army's Third Division had increased to over 2,000 by the morning of the 16th.

　　At 8 p.m. on the 13th, an enemy company advanced towards the height in three groups. One group advanced through the southwestern depression to within twenty or thirty meters of our army's front-line positions, where it was intercepted by the sudden firing of our army, and most of this group of enemies was annihilated. The other two groups of enemies were also repelled by our army's artillery fire at the same time. In this night's battle, the enemy suffered 83 casualties. Our army only suffered four wounded and one killed in action.

　　The enemy's arrogance in counterattacking has weakened more and more after repeated setbacks. By the night of the 15th, the attacking enemy was so frightened that they turned around and ran as soon as they saw our army's counterattack signal. However, they still did not escape the pursuit of our army's shells and were killed and wounded in large numbers.

　　According to captured enemy soldiers, the 18th Regiment of the Li pseudo-army's Third Division suffered the most casualties in this battle. Only twenty-odd people remained in the 2nd Company of the regiment; the 6th and 7th Companies were also merged into one company due to heavy casualties and were reinforced with new recruits twice. The captured enemy soldiers said that the Li pseudo-army soldiers who were lucky enough to survive the offensive were gnawing on cold, hard rice balls on the front line and were terrified at the mention of "Wuming Mountain" (No Name Mountain).

    朝鲜东线高地争夺战中李伪军遭受痛击伤亡已达二千多人
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】本社记者报道：东线文登里西北边岩洞附近某高地的争夺战中，李伪军第三师的伤亡到十六日早晨已增到两千多人。
    十三日夜八时，敌人的一个连分三股向高地进犯。其中一股经西南山凹处刚刚进到离我军前沿阵地二三十公尺的地方，就被我军突然发射的火力拦住，这股敌人大部被歼灭。另两股敌人也同时被我军炮火击退。以后，敌人又以一个连到两个连的兵力连续进攻了两次，都遭到了我军炮火的杀伤。这一夜的战斗中，敌人伤亡了八十三名。我军仅负伤四人，牺牲一人。
    敌人反扑的气焰在连续受挫以后，已愈来愈减弱。到十五日夜间，进攻的敌人一看到我军发出的反击讯号，吓得回头就跑。但是，他们仍然没有逃脱我军炮弹的追击，被打死打伤了许多人。
    据被俘的敌军士兵谈，在这次战斗中，李伪军第三师的十八团伤亡最大。该团第二连只剩下了二十几个人；六、七两个连也因伤亡惨重合并成一个连，并且补充过两次新兵。被俘的敌军士兵说，在进攻中侥幸留得活命的李伪军士兵，在火线上啃着又冷又硬的饭团，一提到“无命山”就胆战心惊。
