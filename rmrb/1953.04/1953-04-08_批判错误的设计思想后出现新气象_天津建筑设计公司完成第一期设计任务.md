New Atmosphere After Criticism of Erroneous Design Ideas
Tianjin Architectural Design Company Completes First Phase of Design Tasks

    The design personnel of the Tianjin Architectural Design Company have made significant progress in their ideology and work style after reviewing their work and criticizing erroneous design ideas. While carrying out the first batch of designs this year, they took the initiative to assist the commissioning units in collecting data and went deep into the site for verification and confirmation. They have now completed the first phase of design tasks and improved the quality of the designs.
    This year's basic construction plan for Tianjin was approved relatively late, and there were not many cross-year projects. In order to avoid idle labor due to insufficient commencement of work, the architectural design company had to complete the design of 170,000 square meters of construction from February 25th to the end of March. However, the data provided by the commissioning units was not timely, specific, or detailed enough, and sometimes it differed from the actual situation, making the design lack reliable and sufficient basis. Under these difficult circumstances, the engineers put forward the slogan of "supporting construction units" and took the initiative to conduct on-site investigations and research, helping the commissioning units collect data. For example, the No. 2 Design Group undertook the design of a warehouse project. Because the design of the railway branch line leading to the warehouse could not be resolved by the railway department for a long time, it affected the design of the warehouse. The group repeatedly consulted with the owner and the railway design office more than a dozen times, determined the location of the railway branch line, and personally investigated the track elevation and the elevation of the warehouse site, and determined the height of the railway branch line, so that the design work could proceed smoothly. For example, they also took the initiative to help the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Textile Workers' Union and other units study the engineering requirements of the workers' pneumoconiosis sanatorium, and helped the Automotive Technology School of the First Ministry of Machine Building study the design data, which accelerated the progress of the design.
    Because they began to pay attention to in-depth on-site investigations and research, as well as verification and confirmation of original data, they improved the design quality of many projects and avoided rework. For example, the preliminary design of the No. 2 Electrical Factory had already been determined. This time, the designers of the No. 8 Group, who were responsible for designing the assembly workshop and boiler room of the factory, visited the site in person and learned from the commissioning unit and workers about the production procedures and the key to ensuring product quality. They found that the originally planned assembly workshop was too large, too empty, and had a lot of echo, the transportation route was too narrow, and the location of the boiler room was not appropriate and could not guarantee safety. They designed walls and roofs nailed with shavings for the assembly workshop; rationally designed the power zone, especially the clean factory buildings, and changed the floor to terrazzo. During the visit, the design team also discovered that the foundation soil of the factory's auditorium was not strong enough, and cracks had appeared in the wall under the window sill, so they added a cement reinforced concrete ground beam to the foundation of the assembly workshop. On the site of a mixed warehouse, the designers found an old brick pavement that could be used as a brick base, which even the commissioning unit had not thought of. After the designers investigated and verified the original data of the Trust Commercial Bank warehouse project on site, they found that they all differed from the actual situation. Finally, they consulted with the commissioning unit and modified the original data, which changed the original entire project plan.
    After inspecting the engineering design and criticizing the erroneous design ideas, the designers eagerly demanded to learn from the advanced design experience of the Soviet Union. In the past, the company's structural design calculation methods were not uniform, and different engineers used different calculation formulas, which not only made review difficult, but also caused a lot of waste. Now, the Soviet Evyansky structural calculation method is uniformly adopted, and a reinforced concrete calculation manual has been produced, which can save 10% to 15% of cement in concrete buildings.
    Now the company has completed the first phase of engineering design tasks for this year. In order to do a good job in future engineering design and consolidate the achievements of the large-scale engineering design inspection last year, all design personnel have launched a design reform movement from mid-March.

### 批判错误的设计思想后出现新气象  天津建筑设计公司完成第一期设计任务

    批判错误的设计思想后出现新气象
    天津建筑设计公司完成第一期设计任务
    天津建筑设计公司的设计人员，经过检查工作、批判了错误的设计思想之后，思想作风有显著的进步。在进行今年第一批设计时，主动协助委托单位搜集资料，并深入现场审核、对证，现在已完成了第一期设计任务，并改善了设计质量。
    今年天津基本建设计划批下较晚，跨年度工程不多。为避免因为开工不足而产生窝工现象，建筑设计公司从二月二十五日到三月底必须完成十七万平方公尺的工程设计。但是，委托单位供给的资料不及时、不具体、不详细，有时并与实际情况有出入，使设计没有可靠的、足够的依据。在这种困难情况下，工程师们提出了“支援施工单位”的口号，主动到现场调查研究，帮助委托单位搜集资料。如设计二组承担设计的一项仓库工程，由于通往仓库的铁路支线的设计铁路方面迟迟不能解决，影响了仓库的设计。该组便连续找业主和铁路设计处商量了十数次，确定了铁路支线的位置，又亲自调查了路轨标高和仓库所在地面的标高，定出了铁路支线的高度，使设计工作能够顺利进行。又如他们曾主动帮助天津市总工会、市纺织工会等单位研究工人肺病疗养院的工程要求，帮助第一机械工业部汽车技术学校研究设计资料，加快了设计的进度。
    由于他们开始注意了深入现场调查研究及审核、对证原始资料的工作，改进了不少工程的设计质量，避免了返工现象。例如电工二厂的初步设计是早已确定了的。此次负责设计该厂装配车间和锅炉房的第八组的设计人员亲到现场参观，并向委托单位和工人了解生产程序和保证产品质量的关键等问题后，发现原来计划设计的装配车间太大，太空，回音很大，运输路线太狭，锅炉房的位置不恰当，不能保证安全。他们便为装配车间设计了钉有刨花板的墙壁和屋顶；合理地设计了动力区，特别需要清洁的厂房，换了磨石地。在参观中，设计组还发现了该厂礼堂因地基土的耐力不够，窗台下墙身已出现裂痕，便又为装配车间的地基加设了洋灰钢筋地梁。在一座混合仓库的基地上，设计人员找到了连委托单位也没想到的可做为砖基的旧砖墁地面。信托商行仓库工程的各项原始资料，当设计人员到现场调查、对证之后，发现都与实际情况有出入，最后和委托单位商议，修改了原有的资料，使得原来整个的工程计划都改变了。
    在检查工程设计，批判了错误的设计思想之后，设计人员们迫切要求学习苏联的先进设计经验。该公司过去对工程结构设计计算方法不统一，各工程师使用计算公式不同，不但审核困难，而且造成了很多的浪费。现在统一采用了苏联依维扬斯基结构计算法，制出了钢筋混凝土计算手册，可在混凝土建筑物中节省百分之十至十五的水泥。
    现在该公司已完成了本年第一期工程设计任务。为了做好今后的工程设计，巩固去年工程设计大检查的成绩，全体设计人员已从三月中旬开始展开了设计改革运动。（陈向新、赵涌）
