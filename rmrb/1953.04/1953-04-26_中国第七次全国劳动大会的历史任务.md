The Seventh National Labor Congress of China is about to open grandly in Beijing, the capital of our country. This congress is being held at a time when our national economy has fully recovered and the first national five-year construction plan has begun to be implemented. It is indeed a very important event in the history of China's labor movement.

The convening of the Seventh National Labor Congress marks a new and glorious victory for the Chinese working class and the labor movement. It signifies that the Chinese labor movement will enter a new historical period, namely, the new period of striving for national industrialization. Therefore, men and women workers across the country are welcoming this year's "May Day" International Labor Day and the convening of the Seventh National Labor Congress with unprecedented excitement and heroic posture, throwing themselves into the upsurge of patriotic labor emulation.

In order to illustrate the infinitely bright future of China's labor movement, let us first recall the path through which China's working class gained liberation. As everyone knows, China's labor movement was carried out directly under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Without the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, it would have been impossible for the Chinese working class to achieve victory. China's conscious labor movement began only after the birth of the Communist Party of China on July 1, 1921, and has now been more than thirty years old. During these thirty years, China's labor movement has experienced a long and tortuous road, facing domestic and foreign enemies armed to the teeth, and carrying out legal, illegal, open, secret, bloody, and non-bloody struggles, enabling the ranks of the working class to grow from small to large, constantly developing and growing from struggle. Although sometimes we have also encountered setbacks, obstructions, and temporary retreats, thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao constantly pointing out the correct path for us, we have been able to turn danger into safety, turn adversity into prosperity, and advance victoriously.

From the First National Labor Congress in 1922 to the Fifth National Labor Congress in 1929, the Chinese labor movement, under the layers of oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, constantly broke through the layers of darkness and advanced towards the road of liberation. By 1937, the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, and the working class and people of the whole country launched a nationwide anti-Japanese wave. The workers in the Liberated Areas, on the one hand, joined the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the South China Anti-Japanese Guerrilla, and directly engaged in armed struggle with the Japanese imperialists, while actively carrying out production to supply military and civilian needs; the workers in the Kuomintang areas, on the one hand, persisted in resisting Japan, and on the other hand, opposed the Kuomintang's policies of surrender, division, and regression; the workers in the cities occupied by the Japanese invaders persisted in the anti-Japanese struggle, lying dormant for a long time, accumulating strength, and uniting and educating the broad masses of workers to wait for the opportunity. These three different regions' labor movements cooperated with each other under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, playing a very important role in supporting and ensuring the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1945, the people of the whole country demanded independence, democracy, and peace. The Liberated Areas became increasingly consolidated and expanded, the US-Chiang-controlled areas became increasingly dark and shrinking, and the Chinese labor movement, opposing the Kuomintang reactionary government's policies of national betrayal, dictatorship, and civil war, increasingly moved towards national unity.

In August 1948, on the eve of the national liberation, the Sixth National Labor Congress was held in Harbin. The historical significance of this congress, as stated in the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the congress: "It shows that the Chinese People's Liberation War under the leadership of the proletariat is approaching its final victory, it shows that a new era of great revolution on a national scale has arrived again, and it shows that the Kuomintang reactionary group's policy of division among workers nationwide has finally been declared bankrupt, and the national labor movement has been reunited under the banner of revolution." The resolution passed by the congress on the current tasks of the Chinese trade union movement clearly pointed out: "The complete overthrow of the rule of imperialism and its running dogs in China and the establishment of a new democratic people's republic is the general prerequisite for improving the current situation of the working class and other democratic classes; it is the highest interest and highest task of the working class and other democratic classes." At this time, the Chinese People's Liberation War was developing vigorously and victoriously, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army was advancing towards the areas ruled by the US-Chiang with the force of a thunderbolt, so the congress called on workers across the country to further strengthen unity and unite the broad masses of peasants and the people of the whole country to fight for national liberation. As everyone knows, we have victoriously completed this great and glorious historical task.

After the national liberation, the Chinese working class has become the leading class of the country. Through the inventory and takeover, restoration of production, democratic reform, and production reform in cities, industrial and mining enterprises, and the patriotic movements and social reform movements such as resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, "three-anti," and "five-anti" on a national scale, the political consciousness of workers across the country has been greatly improved, trade union organizations have been widely developed, and production emulation campaigns have been carried out everywhere, resulting in many advanced figures in labor and tens of thousands of rationalization proposals and inventions, overcoming the imperialist blockade and various difficulties in the process of restoring production, and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Therefore, in the three years since the national liberation, the national industrial production has not only recovered but has exceeded the pre-war production level, thus preparing all the necessary conditions for our country to carry out planned economic construction. Now the process of historical development has placed new tasks before us: consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, realizing national industrialization, striving for the future of socialism, and uniting the workers of the world to fight for the defense of peace.

Therefore, the most central task of the Seventh National Labor Congress is to mobilize the working class across the country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, to give full play to their labor enthusiasm and creativity, and to unite the people of the whole country to ensure the completion and surpassing of the national construction plan, to realize national industrialization, and to guide the development towards socialist and communist society.

In order to accomplish this great historical task, the working class across the country must strive to launch regular patriotic labor emulation, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, learn advanced working methods, tap the potential of production, improve labor organization, abide by labor discipline, improve technology, carry out rationalization proposals, learn and improve business management, so that we can continuously increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, save raw materials, and increase labor productivity.

The Seventh National Labor Congress should not only mobilize men and women workers across the country to fight for ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the national construction plan, but also do a good job in trade union construction, so that the trade union can truly become "a school for learning management, a school for learning business, and a school for communism," as Comrade Lenin taught us. To this end, the trade union must unite all workers, technicians, and staff members, organize patriotic labor emulation, promote advanced experience, organize rationalization proposals, and ensure the completion of production plans and basic construction plans; it must also conduct communist education among the broad masses of workers, education combining patriotism and internationalism, and at the same time, carry out necessary cultural and technical education to improve their political, cultural, and technical level; it must also regularly care for the lives of workers, strengthen safety and health work in mines and construction sites, and appropriately solve their difficult problems, so that the broad masses of workers can consciously, without worry, and peacefully engage in production. We must separately study a set of methods for carrying out work in state-owned factories, joint state-private factories, cooperatives, private factories, and among handicraftsmen in small and medium-sized cities, so that we can cultivate a large number of talents who understand policies, understand production, understand technology, engineering, and science in the actual work process to meet the needs of large-scale economic construction.

Our history of leading national construction is very short, our ideological level is still very low, and our work experience, especially the experience of carrying out large-scale production, is still very little. Therefore, we must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call for earnestly learning from the Soviet Union: "We must not only learn the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also learn the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must launch an upsurge of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country to build our country." (Chairman Mao's instructions at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference)

At the same time, although we have the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and the help of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in our work, we still understand very little about Marxism-Leninism and very little about the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, so we often make mistakes in our work. Therefore, we need to intensify our study and constantly carry out criticism and self-criticism to overcome the shortcomings and errors in our work and improve our ability to work.

The liberated Chinese working class has seen the unprecedented growth of the forces of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union. The superiority of Soviet socialism and the people's democracy in our country and the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe has been vividly demonstrated. We must work harder to produce, consolidate our victory, and strengthen our strength. We must unite more closely with the working class and people of the world and defend world peace with our practical actions to complete and overfulfill the national construction plan.

Comrades workers, technicians, scientific workers, staff members, and trade union workers across the country! The glorious and brilliant prospect of industrialization of our great motherland is kindly calling us. We must act actively and urgently, give play to the working class's high labor enthusiasm and endless creative spirit, unite and lead the people of the whole country, and strive to accomplish our historical task, to build our lovely and great motherland, and to create an infinitely beautiful future!

    中国第七次全国劳动大会的历史任务
    刘宁一
    中国第七次全国劳动大会，就要在我国的首都——北京隆重地揭幕了。这次大会举行于我国国家经济已经完全恢复，第一个国家五年建设计划开始实行的时候，实在是我国工人运动历史上一件非常重大的事情。
    第七次全国劳动大会的召开，标志着我国工人阶级与工人运动的新的辉煌胜利，标志着我国工人运动从此将进入一个新的历史时期，即为国家工业化而奋斗的新时期。因此，全国的男女职工们正在以无比的兴奋欢愉心情和英雄姿态，投入爱国主义劳动竞赛的热潮，来迎接今年的“五一”国际劳动节与第七次全国劳动大会的召开。
    为了要说明我国工人运动的无限光明的前途，首先让我们回忆一下我国工人阶级获得解放所经由的道路。大家都知道，中国的工人运动一开始就是在中国共产党的直接领导之下进行的，没有中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，中国工人阶级是不可能取得胜利的。我国的自觉的工人运动是从一九二一年七月一日中国共产党诞生之后才开始的，到现在已经有三十多年的历史了。在这三十多年的过程中，我国工人运动经历了漫长的艰难曲折的道路，面对着武装到牙齿的国内外敌人，进行了合法的、非法的、公开的、秘密的、流血的和不流血的斗争，使工人阶级的队伍从小到大，不断地从斗争中发展和成长着。虽然有时候我们也遭遇过挫折、阻挠和暂时的退却，但是由于共产党和毛主席不断地给我们指出正确的道路，我们就能化险为夷、转危为安，胜利前进。
    从一九二二年第一次全国劳动大会到一九二九年第五次全国劳动大会的时期，中国工人运动在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的层层压迫下，不断冲破了重重黑暗，向着解放的道路前进。到一九三七年，抗日战争爆发了，全国的工人阶级和人民掀起了全国的抗日浪潮。解放区的工人一方面参加了八路军、新四军及华南抗日游击队，和日本帝国主义者直接进行武装斗争，同时积极进行生产，供给军需民用；在国民党区的工人一面坚持抗日，一面反对国民党的投降、分裂与倒退；在日寇占领的城市的工人坚持抗日斗争，长期埋伏，积蓄力量，团结和教育广大职工以待时机。这三个不同的地区的工人运动在中国共产党的领导下互相配合，对支援和保证抗日战争的胜利起了十分重大的作用。一九四五年抗日战争胜利以后，全国人民要求独立、民主与和平。解放区日益巩固与扩大，美蒋统治区日益黑暗与缩小，中国工人运动、反对国民党反动政府的卖国独裁与内战的政策，日益走上全国的团结统一。
    到了一九四八年八月，全国解放的前夕，在哈尔滨召开了第六次全国劳动大会。这次大会的历史意义，正如中共中央致大会的祝词中所说的：“表示在无产阶级领导下的我国的人民解放战争已经接近最后胜利，表示全国性的新的大革命时期又已到来，表示国民党反动集团在全国工人中的分裂政策已经最后宣告破产，全国工人运动重新在革命的旗帜下统一起来。”在大会所通过的关于中国职工运动的当前任务的决议中明确地指出：“彻底推翻帝国主义及其走狗在中国的统治，建立新民主主义的人民共和国，乃是改善工人阶级及其他民主阶级人民目前状况的总前提；乃是工人阶级及其他民主阶级人民当前的最高利益与最高任务。”这个时候，中国人民解放战争正在猛烈而胜利地开展，中国人民解放军正以摧枯拉朽之势，向着美蒋所统治的地区进军，所以大会号召全国工人进一步加强团结，并团结广大农民和全国人民，为争取全国解放而斗争。人们都知道，这个伟大的光荣的历史任务，我们已经胜利地完成了。
    在全国解放以后，中国工人阶级已经成为国家的领导阶级。通过城市、工矿企业中的清点接管、恢复生产、民主改革、生产改革，和全国范围内的抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命、“三反”、“五反”等爱国运动和社会改革运动之后，全国职工的政治觉悟大大提高，工会组织广泛发展，到处开展着生产竞赛运动，产生了很多的劳动中的先进人物，出现了千万件的合理化建议与发明创造，克服了帝国主义的封锁和恢复生产过程中的种种困难，学习了苏联的先进经验，因此，在全国解放后三年以来，全国的工业生产不但恢复而且已经超过了战前的生产水准，这样就为我国进行有计划的经济建设准备好了各种必要的条件。现在历史发展的进程已把巩固人民民主专政，实现国家工业化，争取社会主义的前途，和团结全世界工人为保卫和平而斗争的新任务放在了我们的面前。
    因此，第七次全国劳动大会的最中心的任务，就是动员全国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，充分发挥劳动热情和创造精神，并团结全国人民为保证完成和超过国家建设计划，实现国家工业化并引导向社会主义和共产主义社会发展而斗争。
    为了完成这个伟大的历史任务，全国工人阶级必须努力展开经常的爱国主义劳动竞赛，学习苏联的先进经验，学习先进的工作方法，发掘生产的潜在能力，改善劳动组织，遵守劳动纪律，提高技术，进行合理化建议，学会并改善经营管理，使我们能够不断地增加产量，提高质量，减低成本，节省原材料，提高劳动生产率。
    第七次全国劳动大会既要动员全国的男女职工为了保证完成和超额完成国家建设计划而斗争，因此，就要把工会建设工作做好，做到像列宁同志教导我们的那样，使工会真正成为“学习管理的学校，学习经营的学校，共产主义的学校。”为此，工会就要团结全体工人，技术人员和职员，组织爱国劳动竞赛，推广先进经验，组织合理化建议，保证完成生产计划和基本建设计划；又要在广大职工群众中进行共产主义的教育，爱国主义和国际主义结合的教育，同时进行必要的文化和技术的教育，以提高他们的政治、文化和技术的水平；还要经常地关心职工的生活，加强工矿和工地的安全卫生工作，适当地解决他们的困难问题，使广大职工能够自觉地无顾虑地安心地进行生产。我们要分别研究在国营工厂、公私合营工厂、合作社、私营工厂和在中小城市手工业者中进行工作的一套方法，使我们能够在实际工作过程中培养出大批的懂得政策、懂得生产、懂得技术、工程和科学的人材，以适应大规模经济建设的需要。
    我们领导国家建设的历史很短，我们的思想水平还很低，工作经验，特别是进行大规模生产的经验还很少，因此我们要坚决响应毛主席关于认真学习苏联的号召：“我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。”（毛主席在中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第四次会议上的指示）
    同时，我们在工作中虽然有党中央和毛主席的英明领导和苏联的先进经验的帮助，但我们对于马克思、列宁主义还懂得很少，对于苏联的先进经验也懂得很少，因而在工作中就常常发生错误。因此，我们就需要加紧学习并不断地进行批评与自我批评，来克服我们工作中的缺点和错误，提高我们的工作能力。
    解放了的中国工人阶级已经看到了以苏联为首的和平民主力量空前壮大。苏联社会主义和我国及东欧人民民主国家人民民主主义的优越性已经生动地表现出来。我们要更加努力生产，巩固我们的胜利，加强我们的力量。我们要和全世界的工人阶级和人民更加紧密地团结起来，以我们完成并超额完成国家建设计划的实际行动来保卫世界和平。
    全国工人、技术人员、科学工作者、职员与工会工作者同志们！我们伟大祖国的光辉灿烂的工业化前景已在亲切召唤着我们，我们要积极地紧张地行动起来，发挥工人阶级高度的劳动热情与无穷无尽的创造精神，团结并带动全国人民，为了完成我们的历史任务，为了建设我们可爱的伟大祖国与创造无限美满的未来而努力奋斗吧！
