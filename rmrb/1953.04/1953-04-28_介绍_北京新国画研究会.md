Introducing the "Beijing New Chinese Painting Research Association"
    Ye Qianyu
    The Beijing New Chinese Painting Research Association was officially established in August 1949. Its purpose is to unite Chinese painters in Beijing, conduct political study and professional research, critically accept the legacy of Chinese painting, promote the excellent traditions of Chinese art, and create Chinese paintings that are loved by the people and beneficial to the people. With the help of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers and the All-China Association of Fine Arts Workers, the association's affairs have gradually developed. It now has more than 200 members, including famous painters such as Qi Baishi, Yu Feian, Chen Banding, Pu Xuezhai, Xu Yansun, Sun Songzhao, Hu Peihang, Wang Aishi, Xu Shixue, Qin Zhongwen, Ma Jin, Wu Jingting, Wu Guangyu, Hui Xiaotong, Wang Xuetao, Chen Yuandu, Wang Shensheng, and Yan Bolong.
    At the beginning of the liberation of Beijing, the Chinese painting market in Liulichang became deserted. Chinese painters were quite worried about the future of Chinese painting. Some Chinese painters raised the question: Do the people need Chinese painting? Can Chinese painting also serve the people? Some people thought that Chinese painting had no future, and no one would be interested in Liulichang anymore. Some people even put away the landscape and flower-and-bird paintings hanging at home, believing that this kind of stuff was no longer useful! Later, several forums were held, and everyone exchanged opinions on improving Chinese painting. The worries about the future of Chinese painting were dispelled, and it was recognized that the problem lay in how Chinese painting could serve the people. After more than two months of preparation, Chinese painters created more than 200 new works and held a New Chinese Painting Exhibition in May 1949. Mr. Qi Baishi, an expert in painting shrimps and crabs, and Mr. Chen Banding, an expert in painting flowers and birds, both exhibited their works at this exhibition; among the works of other painters, some reflected the life of the working people, some reflected agricultural production, and some reflected the victory of the People's Liberation Army and the relationship between the army and the people. This exhibition received attention from all sides, and Chinese painters affirmed that Chinese painting had a future. At the same time, due to the public's comments on the works, Chinese painters also had a demand for ideological remolding. The Beijing New Chinese Painting Research Association was organized on the basis of the conscious development of Chinese painting and the remolding of thought.
    After the establishment of the Beijing New Chinese Painting Research Association, the members first studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and invited literary critic Wang Chaowen to give an enlightening report. In the second half of 1951, with the help of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, bi-weekly political study sessions were held, and Comrades Lao She and Jiang Feng were invited to give reports. In these studies, Chinese painters criticized the views of not asking about politics, being aloof and self-admiring, and being obsessed with technique, so that they could improve their thinking. For example, Mr. Hu Peihang said: "Learning is good, and the way I see things is different from before. In the past, I always thought I was right, but now I have to discuss everything with everyone." Mr. Chen Jihe was over seventy years old and hard of hearing; but he listened carefully at every discussion; and the old painter Lu Hejiu never missed a study session. The work attitude and methods of Chinese painters have also been improved. In order to study business, sketch classes and Chinese painting research classes were established to practice sketching figures and flowers and birds from real objects; when painting pigeons, people were invited to explain the characteristics of the pigeon's body and the methods of expressing feathers; when painting the Summer Palace, they went to the Summer Palace to make drafts on the spot.
    Due to the Chinese painters' active desire for progress, they have received attention from all sectors of society. Some painters who are good at figure painting responded to the call of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and created many New Year pictures and comic strips, which were adopted and published. They also drew various practical pictures, such as hygiene posters and wild vegetable atlases. This shows that they have gradually established a new attitude of serving the people.
    In 1951, all members donated works to participate in the "Resist America, Aid Korea Calligraphy and Painting Charity Sale." In 1952, on National Day, Chinese painters completed more than 300 paintings and calligraphy works in just four days to decorate the lanterns hanging in Tiananmen Square, and gloriously accepted the bonus and pennant from the National Day Celebration Preparatory Committee. More than 80 members, led by Hu Peihang and Xu Yansun, participated in the parade of the Beijing Literary and Art Army. When the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was held in the capital, Chinese painters collectively created two large paintings as gifts to the conference. All of this is a concrete manifestation of the Chinese painters' concern for politics and love for the motherland.
    Some painters who are good at painting landscapes, flowers, and birds doubted the future of landscape, flower, and bird painting, but this doubt was gradually eliminated in later study and creative practice. In the past, landscape painters only inherited the brush and ink techniques and composition of the ancients in the studio, and rarely came into contact with natural scenery. Today's Chinese painters all demand to express the beautiful rivers and mountains of the great motherland and use this theme to educate the people to love the motherland. Mr. Wu Jingting has been painting landscapes for more than 20 years and has a deep understanding of the painting methods of ancient masters; but he has rarely traveled to famous mountains and rivers. Therefore, when he created "Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River" in 1951, he could only refer to the works of the ancients to determine the composition. Some comrades pointed out to him: Today, the Yangtze River is not just a few white sails, but already has steamships, and there are also highways and cars on both sides. He gladly accepted everyone's opinions and added realistic scenery to the picture. Another painting, "The Great Wall," co-created by Wu Huansun, Chen Yuandu, and Tian Shiguang, expresses the magnificent spirit of the Great Wall and also depicts the life of the people in the Great Wall area. These landscape paintings combined with real life were exhibited at the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival held in Berlin and received praise from Chinese and foreign people. Another example is the recent works of Mr. Qi Baishi and Mr. Yu Feian - "Peace Dove," which not only enriches our spiritual life, but also expresses the old gentlemen's concern for the cause of world peace. These examples can prove that as long as the Chinese painters' thoughts are in tune with the wishes of the people, as long as the Chinese painters understand what the people love and want, and create according to the people's thoughts and feelings, they will surely be welcomed by the people.
    The activities of the Beijing New Chinese Painting Research Association for more than three years have focused on the study and social service work of the members. Although these two aspects of work have yielded some results, the work of promoting the excellent traditions of Chinese painting, organizing creation, and launching discussions on creative issues has not been well undertaken; at the same time, the quantity and quality of Chinese painting creation cannot meet the needs of the people. Therefore, in the 1952 work summary, the future direction and tasks were put forward: in addition to continuing to study and participate in social services, the focus should be placed on research and creation. Conscientiously study Chinese painting and create more and better works to meet the needs of the people.
    In order to ensure the implementation of the new tasks, with the help of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers and the All-China Association of Fine Arts Workers, a plan for adjusting the organizational structure and work plan has recently been formulated. All members launched a heated discussion on this new plan, and finally decided to change the name of the "Beijing New Chinese Painting Research Association" to the "Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association," elect a new executive committee, revise the articles of association, reorganize the organization, and carry out creation and research activities; in order to welcome the economic and cultural construction of the motherland.

    介绍“北京新国画研究会”
    叶浅予
    北京新国画研究会于一九四九年八月正式成立，它的宗旨是团结北京的国画家，进行政治学习和业务研究，批判地接受国画遗产，发扬中国美术的优良传统，创作人民喜爱，和对人民有益的国画。在北京市文学艺术工作者联合会、中华全国美术工作者协会的帮助之下新国画研究会的会务逐渐发展起来。现在共有会员二百余人，名画家如齐白石、于非闇、陈半丁、溥雪斋、徐燕荪、孙诵诏、胡佩衡、汪霭士、徐石雪、秦仲文、马晋、吴镜汀、吴光宇、惠孝同、王雪涛、陈缘督、汪慎生、颜伯龙等都参加了。
    北京解放之初，琉璃厂的国画市场冷落起来，国画家们对于国画前途颇有顾虑，一部分国画家提出疑问：人民是否需要国画呢？国画是否也可以为人民服务呢？有的人认为国画再没有出路了，琉璃厂再不会有人问津了。有的人甚至把家里挂的山水画、花鸟画也收藏起来，他们认为这套玩意儿再没有用了！后来举行了几次座谈会，大家交换了改进国画的意见。对国画前途的顾虑消除了，认识到问题在于国画怎样为人民服务。经过两个多月的筹备，国画家们创作了两百多幅新作品，在一九四九年五月间举办了新国画展览会。精写虾蟹的齐白石老先生和善画花鸟的陈半丁老先生都在这次展览会上展出了他们的作品；在其他画家的作品中，有的反映劳动人民的生活，有的反映农业生产，有的反映人民解放军的胜利和军民关系。这次展览会得到了各方面的重视，国画家们肯定地认为国画是有前途的。同时，由于群众对作品的评论，国画家们又有了思想改造的要求。就在发展国画和改造思想的自觉的基础上，组织了北京新国画研究会。
    北京新国画研究会成立以后，会员们首先学习毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，并请文艺批评家王朝闻同志作了启发性报告。一九五一年下半年，在北京市文学艺术工作者联合会的帮助下，举办了双周政治学习，曾请老舍、江丰等同志作过报告。在这些学习中，国画家们批判了不问政治、孤高自赏、技术至上等观点，使自己在思想上提高一步。例如胡佩衡先生说：“学习就是好，看事和以前不同了。过去总以为自己对，现在凡事得和大家商量商量。”陈济和老先生七十多岁了，耳朵重听；但他在每次讨论时都仔细倾听；老画家陆和九先生参加学习会，从来没有缺过席。国画家们的工作态度和工作方法也有了改进。为了研究业务，成立了素描班和国画研究班，练习人物和花鸟的实物写生；画鸽子时，请人讲解鸽子的体态特点和羽毛的表现方法；画颐和园就到颐和园去实地起稿。
    由于国画家们的积极要求进步，他们受到社会各方面的重视。一部分长于人物画的画家们，响应中央人民政府文化部的号召，创作了许多年画和连环画，并经采用出版。他们又绘制了各种实用的图画，如卫生挂图、野菜图谱等。这就说明了他们逐渐建立了为人民服务的新的态度。
    一九五一年全体会员捐献作品，参加了“抗美援朝书画义卖会”。一九五二年国庆节，国画家们在短短四天中突击完成了三百多幅字画，装饰了天安门楼里的挂灯，光荣地接受了庆祝国庆节筹备委员会的奖金和奖旗。并有八十多名会员，由胡佩衡、徐燕荪领队，参加了北京市文艺大军的游行队伍。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在首都开会时，国画家们集体创作了两幅大画向大会献礼。这一切都是国画家们关心政治、热爱祖国的具体表现。
    一部分长于画山水、花鸟的画家怀疑山水、花鸟画的出路，但这种疑虑后来在学习中和创作实践中逐渐消除了。过去的山水画家只是在画室里承袭古人的笔墨与章法，很少和自然景物接触。而今天的国画家们都要求表现伟大祖国的锦绣河山，用这种题材来教育人民热爱祖国。吴镜汀先生画了二十多年的山水画，对于古代名家的画法处理有较深的体会；但他很少游历过名山大川。所以他在一九五一年创作“长江万里图”时，只能参考古人的作品来决定构图。有些同志向他提出：今天长江里不只是几片白帆，已经有了轮船，两岸也有了公路和汽车。他欣然接受了大家的意见，在画面上增加了现实中存在的景物。另外一幅由吴幻荪、陈缘督、田世光合作的“万里长城图”，表现了长城的雄伟气魄，也描绘了长城一带人民的生活。这两幅与现实生活相结合的山水画，曾在柏林举行的第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节上展出，得到了中外人士的好评。又如齐白石、于非闇两位先生的近作——“和平鸽”，不仅丰富了我们的精神生活，而且表达了老先生们对于世界和平事业的关怀。这些例子可以证明：只要国画家的思想和人民的愿望合拍，只要国画家们懂得人民爱什么、要什么，根据人民的思想和感情来创作，一定会受到人民的欢迎的。
    北京新国画研究会三年多以来的活动，着重在会员学习和社会服务的工作上。这两方面的工作虽然有了一些收获，但对发扬中国绘画的优良传统、组织创作和开展创作问题的讨论等工作，却没有很好地担负起来；同时在国画创作的数量和质量上也还不能适应人民的需要。所以在一九五二年的工作总结中提出了今后的方针和任务：除了继续进行学习和参加社会服务之外，要把重点放在研究和创作这一方面。认真研究中国绘画，创作出更多、更好的作品，以满足人民的需要。
    为了保证新任务的执行，最近在北京市文学艺术工作者联合会、中华全国美术工作者协会的帮助之下，制订了关于调整组织机构和工作计划的方案。全体会员对这一新的方案展开了热烈的讨论，最后决定把“北京新国画研究会”这一名称改为“北京中国画研究会”，选举了新的执行委员会，修改会章，整理组织，开展创作与研究活动；以此来迎接祖国的经济和文化建设。
