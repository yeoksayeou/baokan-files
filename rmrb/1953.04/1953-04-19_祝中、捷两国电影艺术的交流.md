The Czechoslovak Film Week currently being held in Beijing and the Chinese Film Week to be held in Prague in May will undoubtedly further deepen the mutual understanding between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples, enhance the friendship between the two peoples, and strengthen the exchange of cultural arts between the two countries.

From the films screened during this Czechoslovak Film Week, we can see how similar the thoughts and feelings of the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples are! It suffices to mention just one film from this exhibition—"New Fighters Rise Up"—to illustrate this point. This film is adapted from a novel of the same name by the current Czechoslovak President, Comrade Zápotocký, and the revolutionary Budchatzki depicted in the film is modeled after Comrade Zápotocký's father. The film describes Zápotocký's father's generation spreading the truth of revolution among the broad masses of the Czech people, patiently organizing workers to carry out tortuous and arduous struggles against the bourgeoisie. At that time, the disseminators of the theories of Marx and Engels were shifting from the stage of vigorous political struggle throughout Europe to the position of meticulously and deeply educating the working class. The First International, which led the world communist movement at the time, had already been dissolved, and some socialist factions representing the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie were showing signs of dejection. The ruling bourgeois lords had gradually ceased to take the socialist movement of the working class seriously. Budchatzki, depicted in the film, was like a spark, burning in his exiled hometown—the village of Zakolany in the Kladno district. From the old man who rang the bell to the masses of workers at the sugar factory, they began to distrust the Social Democrats, giving them cold looks and ridicule, but these did not affect Budchatzki's revolutionary enthusiasm in the slightest. He endured the insults and patiently spread the truth among the working masses, gradually bringing them closer to the revolution. In a Social Democratic group of three, he insisted on cooperating with the priest and the village chief who represented the interests of the capitalists, but in the cooperation, he never concealed his position and views. In this way, the whole village finally followed the Social Democrat Budchatzki. As a result, the village chief suffered defeat, the priest became isolated; and the sugar factory manager also felt helpless against the newly emerging revolutionary forces.

This reminds us that more than twenty years ago, when the Chinese revolution was suffering serious difficulties, when many people felt doubt, pessimism, and disappointment about the existing revolutionary forces, the Marxist-Leninist fighters were still full of revolutionary confidence. They firmly believed that "a single spark can start a prairie fire," and they made people see the dawn of a new day from the dark night filled with thick fog! They upheld the truth under the heavy pressure of counter-revolutionary forces, and they sowed the seeds of revolution on the wasteland swept by the fierce wind, believing that they would surely bear rich revolutionary fruits in the future.

We have reason to say that the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples are nations with ideals and perseverance. They were nurtured and grown up in the long-term revolutionary storms, and today they stand at the forefront of defending world peace.

In another film—"The Steel City"—we see the rapid awakening of the class consciousness of Czechoslovak workers. This is fifty years (from 1881 to 1931) after the era depicted in "New Fighters Rise Up." The ranks of the Czechoslovak working class were stronger, and the momentum of the struggle was even grander. When we watch another film—"The Victorious Advance"—we feel even more that the victorious Czechoslovak working class, under the leadership of Comrades Gottwald and Zápotocký, is already an invincible and powerful force defending European and world peace.

The other films, whether depicting the situation before the revolutionary victory, "Battle Before Dawn," or depicting the peaceful construction of Czechoslovakia after the revolutionary victory, "The Road to Happiness," "Katya," "The Embankment," and "The Happy Competition," all make us breathe in the youthful spirit of the Czechoslovak people. From these films, we not only have a good understanding of the current situation of the Czechoslovak people, but also see their history of struggle and the source of victory. From the perspective of film art, these films are of great reference value to young Chinese filmmakers. The great development of Czechoslovak people's films since the declaration of nationalization in 1945 is worth learning from by Chinese filmmakers in many ways. It is particularly noteworthy that Czechoslovak film art has more and better achievements in depicting the theme of the modern industrial working class and creating the image of the Czechoslovak working class than the films of New China. We should learn from them well.

In the nearly four years of the motherland's construction, the Chinese working class has continuously received the brotherly and selfless help of the Czechoslovak working class. We have also received this valuable help in building the film industry. Through this Czechoslovak film exhibition and the Chinese film exhibition to be held in Prague in May, filmmakers from the two countries will surely unite more closely with brotherly friendship, learn from each other, and make their art better serve the people.

    祝中、捷两国电影艺术的交流
    锺惦棐
    正在北京举行的捷克斯洛伐克电影周和将于五月间在布拉格举行的中国电影周，无疑地会更进一步加深中、捷两国人民的相互了解，增进两国人民的友谊，加强两国文化艺术的交流。
    我们从这次捷克斯洛伐克电影周放映的电影中可以看到，中、捷两国人民的思想感情是多么相似！只消举出在这次展览中的一部影片——“新战士站起来”，便够说明这点。这部影片是根据现任捷克斯洛伐克总统萨波托斯基同志的一本同名的小说改编的，影片中所描写的革命者布德查斯基，就是以萨波托斯基同志的父亲为模特儿的。影片描述萨波托斯基父辈在捷克广大人民中传布革命的真理，耐心地组织工人起来对资产阶级进行曲折而艰苦的斗争。那时候，马克思、恩格斯的学说的传播者正在整个欧洲从轰轰烈烈的政治斗争的舞台上，转到细致地深入地教育工人阶级的岗位上。当时领导着世界共产主义运动的第一国际已经解散，一些代表着资产阶级、小资产阶级的社会主义流派，正表现着垂头丧气。当权的资产阶级老爷们，已经渐渐地不把工人阶级的社会主义运动看在眼里。影片中所描写的布德查斯基，像一颗火种，在他所流放的故乡—克拉德诺区札阔兰村燃烧起来。从打钟的老头到糖厂的工人群众，开始不相信社会民主党人，给他们以冷眼和嘲讽，但是这些丝毫没有影响布德查斯基的革命情绪。他忍受着侮辱在工人群众中耐心地传播着真理，使工人群众慢慢地接近了革命。他在一个社会民主党的三人小组中坚持和代表着资本家利益的神甫与村长合作，但在合作当中，他又从不隐藏自己的立场和观点。这样，全村的人最后终于跟着社会民主党人布德查斯基走。结果是村长遭受失败，神甫陷入孤立；而糖厂经理，对新生的革命势力，也感到无可如何。
    这就使我们联想到二十多年前，当中国革命遭受着严重困难的时候，当许多人对现存的革命力量感到怀疑，悲观、失望的时候，马克思、列宁主义的战士们却依然充满了革命信心。他们坚信：“星星之火，可以燎原”，他们使人们从弥漫着浓雾的黑夜中看见了行将破晓的曙光！他们在反革命势力的重压下坚持着真理，他们在疾风扫过的荒原上播下革命的种子，相信将来定会结出肥硕的革命果实。
    我们有理由说，中、捷两国人民都是有理想、有毅力的民族。他们是在长时期的革命风浪中被哺育成长起来，而且今天站到了保卫世界和平的最前列。
    在另外一部影片——“钢铁的城”中，我们看见捷克斯洛伐克工人的阶级意识的迅速觉醒。这是在距“新战士站起来”所描写的年代五十年（一八八一年到一九三一年）之后，捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级的队伍更坚强了，斗争的声势也更加壮阔得多了。当我们看另一部影片——“胜利的进军”的时候，我们就更加觉得，胜利了的捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级，在哥特瓦尔德和萨波托斯基同志领导之下，已经是捍卫着欧洲和世界和平的一支不可征服的强大力量。
    另外几部影片，无论是描写革命胜利前的情况的“黎明前的战斗”，或是描写革命胜利后捷克斯洛伐克和平建设的“幸福之途”、“卡嘉”、“水堤”和“快乐的竞赛”，都使我们呼吸到捷克斯洛伐克人民的青春的气息。我们从这些影片中，不仅很好的了解到捷克斯洛伐克人民今天的状况，而且看到他们的斗争历史和胜利的源泉。从电影艺术上说，这些影片对于年轻的中国电影工作者是有很大的借鉴作用的。捷克斯洛伐克人民电影从一九四五年宣布国有化以来的长足发展，在许多方面，都是值得我们中国电影工作者学习的。特别值得注意的是：捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术在描写现代产业工人阶级的主题和创造捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级的形象方面，比之新中国的电影有着更多、更好的成就。我们应该好好向它们学习。
    中国工人阶级在近四年的祖国的建设事业中，曾经不断地得到捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级兄弟般的无私的帮助，我们在建设电影工业上，也同样得到过这种可贵的帮助。通过这次捷克斯洛伐克电影展览和五月间将在布拉格举行的中国电影展览，两国电影工作者一定会以兄弟般的友谊，团结得更加紧密，互相学习，使自己的艺术更好地为人民服务。
