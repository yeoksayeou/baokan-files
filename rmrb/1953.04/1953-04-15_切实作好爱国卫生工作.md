    Conscientiously Carry Out Patriotic Health Work
    Since the beginning of spring, various regions across the country, in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, have successively launched spring patriotic health crash campaigns. With the active support and participation of the broad masses of the people, this campaign has achieved certain successes.
    In areas where the work has been done well, the leadership mostly formulated plans for carrying out health work in advance, conducted extensive mobilization and propaganda education among the masses; vigorously rectified and established basic-level health organizations, making them a powerful organization for mobilizing and organizing the masses to participate in health work. And they closely integrated health work with the local central work, serving production. During the campaign, they also organized the masses to conduct inspections, using advanced areas to promote backward areas, eliminating "dead corners" in the work, so that the patriotic health campaign could be carried out comprehensively.
    However, in some areas, due to the lack of understanding of the political significance of the movement by leading cadres, they only issued instructions and plans to their subordinate organs and the masses, without properly supervising and inspecting. Some cadres regarded patriotic health work as "the same old thing," so they didn't even study the instructions from above, but handed them over to the secretary to hide in a drawer. In some areas, leading cadres emphasized that "there are too many tasks" and that "health work cannot be squeezed in," so they put patriotic health work aside. Individual cadres in some organs expressed resistance to health work, and when the inspection team went there to inspect, they openly expressed dissatisfaction; some even used rude words to answer the criticisms of the inspectors. Obviously, these are all completely wrong.
    In order to make the patriotic health campaign develop healthily, leading cadres in various regions must, in accordance with the principle of "combining health work with mass movements," conscientiously and responsibly lead the patriotic health work, strengthen the leading bodies of the patriotic health campaign, strengthen the planning of the work, and conduct regular supervision and inspection to overcome the phenomenon of laissez-faire. Areas where the campaign has been carried out relatively well should move forward on the existing basis, using methods such as evaluation and visits to exchange experiences, and mobilize the masses to conduct in-depth inspections to make the patriotic health campaign turn into a regular practice. Areas where the campaign has not been carried out well or has not been started at all must combine it with the local central work, conduct extensive propaganda to the masses, and mobilize everyone to "make up lessons" using appropriate methods.

### 切实作好爱国卫生工作

    切实作好爱国卫生工作
    入春以来，全国各地根据中央人民政府政务院和中央爱国卫生运动委员会的指示，先后展开了春季爱国卫生突击运动。在广大人民群众的积极支持和参加下，这个运动已经取得了一定的成绩。
    在做得好的地区，领导方面多在事前制订了开展卫生工作的计划，在群众中作了广泛的动员和宣传教育；大力整顿和建立了卫生基层组织，使它成为发动和组织群众参加卫生工作的有力组织。并把卫生工作紧紧地和当地的中心工作结合起来，为生产服务。而在运动中，又组织群众进行了检查，以先进地区来推动落后地区，消灭工作中的“死角”，使爱国卫生运动能全面地开展起来。
    但是，也有些地区由于领导干部对运动的政治意义认识不足，光是向所属机关和群众发了指示和计划，没有很好地进行督促检查。有的干部把爱国卫生工作看做是“老一套”，因而连上级的指示也不去研究，把它交给秘书藏在抽屉里去了。有的地区的领导干部，强调“任务太多”，“卫生工作插不上”，就把爱国卫生工作放在一边了。个别机关的干部对卫生工作表示了抗拒，当检查组到那里去检查的时候，竟公然表示了不满；有的甚至用粗暴的话来回答检查人员的批评。显然，这都是完全错误的。
    为了使爱国卫生运动健康地开展起来，各地的领导干部必须根据“卫生工作与群众运动相结合”的方针，认真负责地把爱国卫生工作领导起来，加强爱国卫生运动的领导机构，加强工作的计划性，经常进行督促检查，克服放任自流的现象。运动开展得比较好的地区，应该在已有的基础上向前推进一步，用评比、参观等等方式来交流经验，并发动群众作深入的检查，使爱国卫生运动转入经常化。运动开展得不好或根本没有动起来的地区，必须结合当地的中心工作，向群众进行广泛的宣传，发动大家用适当的方法来“补课”。
