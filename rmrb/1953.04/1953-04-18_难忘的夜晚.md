That night, when No. 8 Blast Furnace was about to be blown in, I went to the Second Engineering Team headquarters of the Machine Installation Engineering Company at the construction site. The Second Team had been working intensely for a week. I had been there several times, and they were always working, even on nights when the snow was so heavy you could barely open your eyes, the workers were working all night long.

But this time, I was greeted by a relaxed atmosphere. Branch Secretary Comrade Xie, with one hand shuffling playing cards and the other pulling Manager Hui, called out, "Come on, come on, let's play cards!"

So the two of them, Technician Yang, and I, played cards together.

But Manager Hui's mind was elsewhere. He suddenly said:

"Our cadres often lag behind the workers. The plans we make, once given to the workers for discussion, often correct our conservative ideas, shorten the progress, ensure the quality, and finally solve the problems we find difficult. This time is truly a lesson."

Branch Secretary Comrade Xie's face also suddenly became serious, and he said: "We only think of fully mobilizing the masses when the task is particularly urgent and difficult."

From their conversation, I learned about the tense situation the previous evening and understood why they felt so relaxed now. The course of events was roughly as follows: Originally, they had fully disclosed everything to the workers this time, so when the mobilization meeting was held, the workers said, don't mobilize us, as long as the design, equipment, and materials are all there, just give the order and set the deadline. Sure enough, the task was completed ahead of schedule in the first three days.

But according to advanced Soviet experience, once the pipeline installation is complete, the pressure must be tested to see if it leaks. If it leaks, leaking gas will suffocate people in the future. The pressure test showed no leaks at all. Just as Manager Hui said, the progress was shortened, and the quality was also guaranteed. The workers were energized!

Later, the old pipeline was pressure tested. It was completed last September. At that time, the pressure test results were very satisfactory. No one expected it to have problems, leaking so badly. Inspection revealed that one valve leaked because it contracted and deformed in the cold weather. But after repairing it and testing again, it still leaked; after repairing it again and testing again, it still leaked. Time was lost for two days. By yesterday evening, the situation suddenly deteriorated seriously.

The technicians lowered their heads, unable to speak. The workers sensed that the situation was not good, and some came to ask, "Can we produce iron as scheduled?"

Branch Secretary Comrade Xie said, "The experts have proposed a rapid furnace baking method. There's still time." But the general mood was a little low, and he also lacked solutions. He was transferred from the army: fighting from the icy Northeast all the way to the hot Hainan Island, then turning around to join the Volunteer Army in snowy Korea. He was suddenly transferred to Anshan Iron and Steel half a year ago. Basic construction is very similar to war in some respects, similar in life and similar in the tension of battle. But the current problem had industrial technical characteristics, and he couldn't come up with a solution.

An incorrect opinion began to seek supporters: we can't do it today. Let's wait for the expert's instructions tomorrow and do whatever they say. The fact is that everyone is exhausted, and they haven't slept for several days and nights. If we stay up another night, can we still work tomorrow?

But Su, the leader of the riveters' squad, somehow found out about this idea and rushed over to vehemently oppose it. He hadn't gone home since the ninth, and hadn't slept well for nine days and nights. The team headquarters ordered him to go to sleep the day before yesterday. He went out for a while and came back saying he couldn't sleep. Yesterday the team headquarters ordered him to go to sleep again. He still didn't sleep. The thought of the task not being completed kept him awake, just like last September during the National Day gift-giving campaign, he couldn't sleep either. He was worried, his voice was hoarse, and his eyes were swollen. This time it was the same. He said, "How can I sleep when I see that the task cannot be completed?"

From the windows of the Second Team headquarters, you could see the colossal No. 8 Blast Furnace, towering on the horizon, but it was still quiet and couldn't operate. The situation was deadlocked. People were exhausted, the mood was getting lower and lower, and two opinions were deadlocked.

Manager Hui returned from a meeting at the company. When he saw the situation, an idea flashed in his mind: "Will the cadres collapse?" He firmly opposed the idea of not working today, resting, and working again tomorrow.

Every minute of time now is precious. This is precisely the time when everyone is actively thinking of solutions. It is always at this juncture that the concept of relying on the masses is most clear in Manager Hui's mind. So he convened an enlarged meeting of technicians, team leaders, and active workers. This manager had previously worked in militia work, land reform, cultural and educational work, and government work. Although he came to Anshan Iron and Steel in 1948, he couldn't come up with a solution in the face of serious technical problems.

They discussed for a long time. The key problem was still not grasped. Several technicians from the blowers also came to support. They raised a series of questions. Is there no other way? Why is it just the valve that has problems? What exactly is the problem? Are there any other problems elsewhere? Suddenly, an active worker responded: "Yes, we haven't planned well, it's like we haven't looked for the problem!" Hearing these words, Manager Hui's face lit up. For two days and two nights, they had been racking their brains about one valve.

"Look for the problem!" he said, "We must inspect the entire old pipeline."

At about nine o'clock at night, a temporary inspection team was organized on the construction site. It was organized by technically proficient cadres, all technicians, team leaders, and technically skilled active workers, and divided into four groups. The scaffolders had already built walkways next to the aerial river-like large pipelines. They skillfully built many wooden scaffolds.

Cadres, technicians, and workers all wore safety belts. Some held soap water, some held smoldering hemp ropes, and some held shiny candles. A group of people went high into the air, climbing onto the pipeline. Air was being blown into the pipeline. On the propaganda platform, the broadcast announced the start of the emergency inspection.

If the pipeline leaked air, applying soap water would cause bubbles to form, the smoldering hemp rope would catch fire, and the candle would be extinguished. Then good news came. Leaks were discovered and announced one after another on the radio. They found a total of a dozen large leaks in various valves and flow conduits. In the cold night sky, they inspected for five hours. Once a leak was discovered, oxygen-electric welders went up to cut and weld it. A pressure test was done at 2:30 a.m., and another pressure test was done at 4:30 a.m. The mercury column stayed up longer each time. Squad Leader Su finally blocked a valve with a baffle, and then tested the pressure. It was seven o'clock then, and the sky was already bright. The mercury column no longer dropped. Now the old pipeline also met the quality standards and did not leak at all.

"It was truly a tense night," Comrade Xie said. "We finally passed smoothly."

"It was a night that is hard to forget," Manager Hui said.

"You've worked hard!" I said.

"Worked hard? Not at all. A blitz is the best!" Manager Hui tilted his head and said. "Our potential is inexhaustible!" Manager Hui paused for a moment and then said: "Basic construction is just like this. No Sundays, no day or night. The project is never finished, this one is finished and another one starts. A person, as long as they are engaged in basic construction, will have a kind of labor enthusiasm that ordinary people do not understand."

Just then, Section Chief Wang ran in. I had been unable to find this busy person for days. He reported that the preparations for unloading the baffle were complete. I quickly followed him out.

We arrived at a small room next to the generator. It was crowded with scaffolders and riveters. The fire in the furnace was blazing. Squad Leader Su, who had persevered for ten days and nights, was finally sent back to rest. Tonight, as long as a baffle inside a pipe is removed, the gas will be used to bake the hot air furnace.

The scaffolders set up another scaffolding. The chairman of the trade union asked them to widen the walkway to avoid accidents and provide room to maneuver. According to a team leader sent by the gas plant, blast furnace gas is very dangerous. Two whiffs of it will intoxicate a person, and they will never wake up again. He brought gas masks. He himself had worn it and stayed in gas so thick you couldn't see the person across from you for forty minutes. But these riveters were wearing gas masks for the first time, and everyone was still a little worried.

The riveters in the small room began to file out in single file, as serious as soldiers before going to the battlefield, silently climbing onto the scaffolding.

We held our breath and looked up from below. Time seemed to pass especially slowly. Later, a large, round baffle slowly descended.

We returned to the Second Team headquarters. But not long after, Section Chief Wang pulled me to the outside of the team headquarters again. It was almost dawn at this time. In the distant sky, there were many colors, flashing like lightning on a summer night, the blue-green light of electric welding. In the northern sky, there were also red clouds above the coke ovens.

"Listen!"

I heard a faint sound, which quickly grew louder and louder, like a hurricane rushing from afar, finally engulfing the entire area in a storm. The wind howled through the pipeline, so strong and powerful, this force seemed to flow in your own blood vessels. What a powerful force! The area came to life in an instant. The people indoors all went outside the team headquarters, and we cheered. We went to the burners under the hot air furnace and observed the situation inside the furnace from a round, transparent viewing hole. A circle of strange violet-colored flames danced inside, danced. We went to the instrument room. Rows of automated instruments stood in the clean, brick-built room. The red and green lights shone like luminous gems.

The storm grew stronger and stronger. Suddenly, the dark No. 8 Blast Furnace was lit. All the lights were turned on at once. From the lights high on the top, to the pearl necklace-like lights on the inclined tower, to the flood of lights on the furnace waist and hearth, No. 8 Blast Furnace was decorated incomparably brilliantly.

Everyone saw it and cheered. The lights on No. 8 Blast Furnace were on. The first automated blast furnace in the new China! Everyone felt an indescribable sense of ease and joy in their hearts. Dawn was quickly approaching. It seemed that the weather had warmed up. It seemed that this was the first dawn of spring. Under your feet, the thawed soil was so soft. In the dawn sky, two five-star red flags were flying on the highest pole of No. 8 Blast Furnace – two dancers, they were displaying their victorious posture.

    难忘的夜晚
    徐迟
    在八高炉要送风的那天晚上，我到工地的机器安装工程公司第二工程队队部去。二队已经紧张了一个星期，我几次去那里，他们都在干，甚至在雪下得眼睛都睁不开的晚上，工人们也是整夜的干。
    但这时候，迎接人的是轻松的空气。支部书记谢同志一手摇着纸牌，一手拉着回经理，叫着：“来来来，打扑克！”
    于是他们两个，杨技术员和我，一起玩纸牌了。
    可是回经理的心思却在纸牌之外。他忽然说：
    “我们干部常常落后于工人。我们订的计划，交给工人一讨论，他们常常就纠正了我们的保守思想，缩短进度，保证质量，最后解决我们觉得棘手的问题。这回真是个教训。”
    支部书记谢同志的脸也忽然严肃起来，说：“我们只在任务特别紧张、困难的关头，才想起充分发动群众。”
    从他们的谈话中，我了解到昨天晚间的紧张情形，懂得了他们现在所以感到轻松的原因。事情的经过大致是这样的：原来他们这次向工人全部交了底，因此在开动员大会的时候，工人们说了，不要动员我们啦，只要你设计，设备，材料全了，只要下命令和给限期就行。果然，在前三天，任务就已经提前完成了。
    但根据苏联的先进经验，管道安装完毕，就要试验压力，看它漏不漏风。要漏的话，将来漏瓦斯是要薰死人的。试压结果一点不漏，正如回经理说的，进度缩短了，质量也保证了，工人们起劲啦！
    后来就试压旧管道了。那是去年九月完工的，那时候试压结果是很圆满的。谁也没想到它会出毛病，漏得这样厉害。检查出来，是一个开闭器漏，因为天气一冷，它冷缩变形了。可是修理了它，再试，还漏；再修理，再试，还是漏。时间就这末损失了两天。到昨天的黄昏，情况突然严重地恶化了。
    技术员们低着头，讲不出话来了。工人们捉摸到情况不好，有的就来问：“还能如期出铁吗？”
    支部书记谢同志说：“专家已提出了快速烤炉法，来得及。”可是一般人的情绪有点低落，他也缺少办法。他是从部队转来的：从冰冷的东北一直战斗到炎热的海南岛，折回头又参加志愿军到飞雪的朝鲜。他是突然在半年之前，给调到鞍钢来的。基本建设在某些地方和战争是很相似的，生活上相似，战斗的紧张也相似。可是眼前的问题带有工业技术性，他就拿不出办法来了。
    一个不正确的意见又开始在寻找附和者：今天不能搞了。等明天专家指示，该怎么办就怎么办吧。现在事实上人人疲劳不堪，都已经几天几宿没有睡觉。再熬上一夜，明天还能工作吗？
    可是铆工班苏班长不知怎的知道这种思想，飞也似的跑来激烈反对这个意见。他从九日起就没回家，九天九宿没有睡好觉。前天队部就下了命令叫他去睡。他出去一会就回来说睡不着。昨天队部又下令叫他去睡。他还是没有睡呢。一想起任务没有完成，就不能睡了，就跟去年九月国庆献礼大突击时，他也不能睡一样。他不放心，嗓子哑了，眼睛红肿了，这回也如此。他说：“眼看任务不能完成，怎么能睡得着觉呢？”
    从二队部的窗子里，可以看见八高炉这庞然大物，耸立在地平线上，但是它还是静悄悄的，不能动作起来。情况可僵住了。人都疲倦透顶，情绪越来越低，两种意见相持不下。
    回经理从公司里开会回来，一看这情况，他脑中就闪过一个思想：“干部会垮下来吗？”他坚决反对今天不工作、休息了明天再干的主张。
    现在的时间每一分钟都是宝贵的。这正是大家积极想办法的时候。总是在这种关头，那依靠群众的观念在回经理脑子里最明确。他就召集了技术员，班组长，工人积极分子来开扩大会。这个经理过去干过民兵工作、土地改革、文教工作和政权工作，虽然一九四八年就来鞍钢，在严重的技术问题前面，他也拿不出办法。
    他们讨论了很久。关键问题还是抓不到。几个鼓风机上的技术员也跑来支援了。他们提出了一连串问题。还有没有别的办法？为什么只是开闭器有毛病？究竟是什么毛病？别处还有没有毛病？忽然一个工人积极分子应道：“是啊，我们好没有打算，好像我们并没有找毛病啊！”听到这声话，回经理脸上放光。两天两夜脑筋想死在一个开闭器上了。
    “找毛病！”他说：“要检查全部旧管道。”
    大约在夜间九时，工地上已经组织起一支临时的检查队伍来。它是由懂技术的干部，技术员全体，班组长及技术好的工人积极分子组织起来的，分了四组。架工们已经在空中河流似的大管道旁边搭起走道来，他们熟练地搭了许多木架。
    干部、技术员和工人都带上了安全带。他们有的手拿胰子水，有的拿薰着火的麻绳头，有的拿了闪闪的洋烛。一行人马，全上高空，爬上管道。管道中送风。宣传台上，播音机宣布突击检查开始。
    如果管道漏风，抹上胰子水就要起泡沫，薰着火的麻绳头就会烧起来，洋烛会被吹灭的。于是喜报来了。发现了漏洞，一个又一个地在播音机上宣布。他们在各种不同的开闭器、流量导管上一共发现了十来个大漏洞。在寒冷的夜空中，他们检查了五个小时，一发现漏洞，就由氧电焊工上去切断和焊接。二点半试压一次，四点半又试压一次，水银柱一次比一次站得久。苏班长最后用一块挡板堵死了一个开闭器，再试压。那时是七点钟，天已大亮了。水银柱就再也不下降，现在旧管道也达到了质量标准，一点不漏。
    “真是一个紧张的夜晚啊，”谢同志说。“我们总算顺利地通过了。”
    “这是一个难于忘记的夜晚。”回经理说。
    “你们辛苦了！”我说。
    “辛苦？一点也不。突击最好！”回经理斜了头说。“我们的潜力是挖不完的啊！”回经理停一会儿又说：“基本建设就是这末回事。没有星期天，没有白天黑夜。工程没有个完的，这个完了那个又开始。一个人，只要从事基本建设，就会有一般人所不了解的劳动热情。”
    就在这个时候，王科长跑进来了。这些日子我一直找不到这个忙人。他报告，卸档板的准备工作已经完成。我赶紧跟着他就往外走。
    我们到了发电机旁边一个小房间里。里面挤满了架工和铆工。炉火炽盛。坚持了十昼夜的苏班长到底给送回去休息了。今夜，只要把一个管道内的档板卸下来，就开始送瓦斯烤热风炉了。
    架工们又搭起了一个脚手架子。工会主席要求他们把走道加宽，以免发生了事故没有回旋余地。据燃气厂派来的一个组长说，高炉瓦斯很厉害，薰上两口，人就醉倒，再醒不来。他拿来了防毒面具。他自己曾带上它在对面不见人的瓦斯中停留过四十分钟。但这些铆工是第一次戴防毒面具，大家还是有点不放心。
    小屋中的铆工们开始鱼贯而出，严肃得如同上战场之前的士兵，默默地爬上架子。
    我们在底下屏息仰望，时间过得特别慢似的。后来，一块圆圆的大档板慢慢地降落下来了。
    我们又回到二队部。但没有很久，王科长又拉我到队部门外。这时大约将近天明了。远远的天空里，色彩很多，一闪一闪像夏夜的闪电，是电焊的青绿色光芒。在北面的天空，还有焦炉之上的红云。
    “你听！”
    我听到微微的声响，很快很快扩大了，像一阵飓风从远处疾驰而来，终于把这整个地区卷旋在风暴中。风在管道中呼啸经过，那样强劲有力，这种力量好像在你自己的血管里流动起来了。是怎样强大的力量啊！这地区在一刹那间活了起来。室内的人都到了队部门外，我们欢呼起来了。我们到了热风炉下的燃烧器上，从一个圆圆的透明的视孔，观察炉内情况。一圈幻异的紫萝兰色的火光在里面跳动，跳动。我们到了计器室内，洁白的砖砌的房间里站着成行的自动化的计器，红灯绿灯亮得像放光的宝石。
    风暴越来越强大。忽然间，那黑黝黝的八高炉试灯了。一下子，全部的灯火都开亮了。从高高顶上的灯，到斜塔上珍珠项圈似的灯，到炉腰和炉缸上的一片泛滥的灯火，把八高炉装点得无比灿烂。
    所有的人都看见了，都欢呼起来了。八高炉上灯火亮了。这新中国的第一座自动化的高炉！人人都觉得心里有说不出来的轻松愉快。黎明很快降临了。似乎天气已经转暖。似乎这是春天的第一个黎明。在你的脚底下，解了冻的泥土是那样地柔软。在黎明的天空中，八高炉的最高的杆上已飘扬着两面五星红旗——两个舞蹈家，它们正在展示胜利的雄姿。
