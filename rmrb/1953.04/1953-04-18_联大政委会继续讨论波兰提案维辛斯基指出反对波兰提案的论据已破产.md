Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 17th: TASS, New York, April 16th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the afternoon of April 14th to continue discussing the Polish proposal on "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Strengthen International Peace and Friendly Cooperation."

The representatives of Iraq, the United Kingdom, Bolivia, and Ukraine spoke at the meeting.

The Iraqi representative advocated an early cessation of the Korean War. He emphasized that if the General Assembly did not try to use the current situation to end the Korean War, it would violate the principles of the United Nations. In his speech, the Iraqi representative spent a large part of his time criticizing the imperialist policies of colonial countries, which suppressed the national liberation movements of colonial peoples and made the international situation tense. He asked the committee to note that the French government's refusal to allow Tunisia and Morocco to become independent violated the principles of the UN Charter and caused unease among all Arab and Asian countries.

The British representative, Jebb, opposed the Polish proposal for an immediate cessation of the Korean War. He expressed his belief that the Panmunjom talks would remove all obstacles to a ceasefire in Korea. The British representative said that the Polish proposals to reduce the armed forces of the major powers by one-third and to prohibit atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction were "unacceptable" at present.

The Bolivian representative did not advocate that the General Assembly reject all the proposals put forward by the Polish delegation. He suggested that the current meeting should not make a decision on the Polish proposal.

The head of the Ukrainian delegation, A. Baranovsky, said that the Ukrainian delegation welcomed and strongly supported the Polish government's proposal because it conformed to the desire of all peoples to safeguard peace. He said that a start had already been made in Korea to resolve the entire issue of prisoners of war, and that the negotiations on the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war were a promising beginning. Recently, an agreement on the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war was signed at Panmunjom. World opinion expressed satisfaction with this news because the agreement paved the way for an agreement on the entire prisoner-of-war issue. Zhou Enlai's statement on March 30th of this year and Kim Il Sung's statement on March 31st of this year have explained the conditions for the exchange of prisoners of war very clearly. The Ukrainian delegation believed that the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the immediate ceasefire in Korea must be studied immediately and could no longer be delayed. Therefore, the Ukrainian delegation strongly supported the Polish proposal with this purpose.

The head of the Ukrainian delegation also supported the Polish proposals for arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Baranovsky spoke in detail about the issue of concluding a peace pact among the five major powers. He said that all those who truly hoped to strengthen peace and establish reliable guarantees for international security must agree to the Polish delegation's proposal on the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers. The head of the Ukrainian delegation finally expressed his firm support for the Polish proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, April 17th: TASS, New York, April 17th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to discuss on April 15th the Polish proposal on "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Strengthen International Peace and Friendly Cooperation."

At the morning meeting, the Brazilian representative spoke on the Brazilian delegation's proposal on the Korean issue. He said that the statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war and the successful negotiations on the issue of sick and wounded prisoners of war were a good omen and a basis for the early resolution of the entire Korean War. He also said that restoring peace in Korea was the first important step in preventing another world war. The Brazilian representative asked the Political Committee to pass the proposal put forward by the Brazilian delegation, which expressed the hope that "further negotiations in Panmunjom can enable the armistice in Korea to be realized in the near future." The proposal also suggested that the President of the General Assembly should immediately reconvene the current session of the General Assembly to continue discussing the Korean issue after the Security Council receives notification of the signing of the Korean armistice agreement, or when the majority of the member states of the United Nations believe that other events occurring in Korea require discussion of the Korean issue.

The Mexican representative asked the representatives of various countries to create an atmosphere of mutual trust, but at the same time, he opposed the adoption of the Polish proposal. The Mexican delegation believed that the proposal to immediately cease hostilities in Korea before the negotiating parties in Panmunjom reached an agreement on all disputed issues was unacceptable.

In his speech, the Indonesian representative emphasized that the proposals of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the repatriation of prisoners of war had removed the last obstacles hindering the realization of peace in Korea, because this proposal provided a solid basis for ending the Korean War. He asked the representatives of the various countries of the Political Committee not to avoid discussing the Korean issue, saying that the United Nations General Assembly must make a decision on the issue of ending the Korean War.

The French representative said that the French delegation would promote the adoption of measures by the United Nations General Assembly to eliminate the threat of another world war. However, he refused to support all the Polish proposals, including the proposal to immediately cease hostilities in Korea and peacefully resolve the entire Korean issue.

The French representative said that the recent proposals of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the repatriation of prisoners of war had removed the last obstacles hindering the realization of an armistice in Korea. He also said that ending hostilities in Korea would be conducive to the easing of international tensions. He expressed the hope that the belligerent parties would not take any "dangerous steps" that might expand the bloodshed in Korea during the current Panmunjom negotiations.

At the afternoon meeting, the Syrian representative said that the Syrian delegation would abstain when voting on the Polish proposal. He said, however, that this action should never be considered an expression of the Syrian delegation's lack of support for the principles put forward in the proposal. He also said that discussing the Polish proposal in the United Nations General Assembly was important for the cause of peace, but that direct negotiations between the major powers could better achieve the goals put forward in the Polish proposal.

The Syrian representative emphasized that the Arab countries supported the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems. He also said that the Arab countries were willing to maintain normal relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, as well as with the Western countries.

Finally, the Syrian representative expressed his support for Brazil's proposal on the Korean issue.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, spoke in support of the Polish delegation's proposal. Vyshinsky summarized the Political Committee's discussion of the Polish proposal and pointed out that the arguments of those representatives who openly opposed the adoption of the Polish delegation's proposal on "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Strengthen International Peace and Friendly Cooperation" had gone bankrupt.

Vyshinsky concluded by saying: "As for the proposal on the Korean issue put forward by the Brazilian delegation, at first glance, it seems worthy of our attention. The Soviet delegation hopes to be able to speak on this issue again after studying this proposal in more detail."

Before adjourning, the U.S. representative, Gross, made a brief speech. As in his first speech, he defended the U.S. position on the issue of arms reduction and armed forces, and once again attempted to portray the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as being established to realize the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter. He expressed his support for Brazil's proposal on the Korean issue.

    联大政委会继续讨论波兰提案维辛斯基指出反对波兰提案的论据已破产
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：联合国大会政治委员会于四月十四日下午举行会议，继续讨论波兰提出的关于“消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的措施”的提案。
    在会上发言的有：伊拉克、英国、玻利维亚及乌克兰等国代表。
    伊拉克代表主张早日停止朝鲜战争。他强调指出，如果大会不设法利用目前的局势来结束朝鲜战争的话，它就违反联合国的原则。伊拉克代表在发言中以很大一部分时间指责殖民国家的帝国主义政策，它们镇压殖民地人民的民族解放运动，使国际局势趋于紧张。他要求委员会注意，法国政府拒绝让突尼斯和摩洛哥独立，是违反联合国宪章的原则的，并且引起所有阿拉伯和亚洲国家的不安。
    英国代表杰伯反对波兰的立刻停止朝鲜战争的建议，他表示相信板门店谈判会扫除朝鲜停战的一切障碍。英国代表说：波兰提出的把大国的武装部队裁减三分之一及禁止原子武器和一切其他大规模破坏的武器的建议在目前是“不能接受的”。
    玻利维亚代表不主张大会拒绝波兰代表团所提出的全部建议。他建议目前的会议不要就波兰建议作出决定。
    乌克兰代表团团长安·巴拉诺夫斯基说，乌克兰代表团欢迎并且极力支持波兰政府的建议，因为它符合于所有人民维护和平的愿望。他说，在朝鲜已经有了解决整个战俘问题的开端，交换病伤战俘的谈判是一种有希望的开端。最近，关于交换病伤战俘的协定已在板门店签订了。世界舆论对这个消息表示满意，因为这个协定为整个战俘问题的协议开辟了道路。周恩来在今年三月三十日所发表的声明和金日成在今年三月三十一日所发表的声明已极其清楚地解释了交换战俘的条件。乌克兰代表团认为，朝鲜问题的和平解决及在朝鲜立即停火的问题必须马上加以研究，不能再事拖延了，因此乌克兰代表团极其坚决地支持抱有这个宗旨的波兰提案。
    乌克兰代表团团长并支持波兰提出的裁减军备和禁用原子武器及其他大规模杀人武器的建议。巴拉诺夫斯基详细谈到缔结五大国和平公约的问题。他说，凡是真正希望加强和平，建立国际安全的可靠保障的人都必须同意波兰代表团提出的关于五大国缔结和平公约的建议。乌克兰代表团团长最后表示坚决支持波兰提案。
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约十七日讯：联合国大会政治委员会四月十五日继续讨论波兰提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的措施”的提案。
    在上午会议上，巴西代表就巴西代表团提出的关于朝鲜问题的提案发言。他说，中华人民共和国外交部部长关于交换病伤战俘问题的声明以及进行得很顺利的关于病伤战俘问题的谈判是一个吉兆，并成为早日解决整个朝鲜战争的基础。他又说，恢复朝鲜和平是防止另一次世界大战的第一个重要步骤。巴西代表要求政治委员会通过巴西代表团提出的提案，这个提案表示希望“在板门店举行的进一步谈判可以使朝鲜停战在最近的将来实现”。提案并建议大会主席在安全理事会接到朝鲜停战协定签字的通知以后，或联合国大多数会员国认为在朝鲜发生的其他事件需要讨论朝鲜问题时，马上就重新召集本届大会会议，以便继续讨论朝鲜问题。
    墨西哥代表要求各国代表造成一种彼此信任的气氛，但是同时他反对通过波兰提案。墨西哥代表团认为，在板门店谈判双方就一切争执中的问题达成协议以前，立即停止朝鲜敌对行动的提案是不能接受的。
    印度尼西亚代表在发言中着重指出：中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国关于遣返战俘的建议扫除了阻碍实现朝鲜和平的最后障碍，因为这个建议提供了结束朝鲜战争的坚固基础。他要求政治委员会各国代表不要避免讨论朝鲜问题，他说，联合国大会必须在结束朝鲜战争问题上作出决定。
    法国代表说，法国代表团将促使联合国大会通过消除另一次世界大战威胁的措施。不过，他拒绝支持所有的波兰建议，包括立刻停止朝鲜境内的敌对行动与和平解决整个朝鲜问题的建议在内。
    法国代表说，中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最近提出的关于遣返战俘的建议扫除了阻碍实现朝鲜停战的最后障碍，他又说，结束朝鲜境内的敌对行动会有利于国际紧张局势的缓和。他表示希望交战双方在目前的板门店谈判期间不要采取可能扩大朝鲜流血的“危险步骤”。
    在下午会议上，叙利亚代表说，在表决波兰提案时，叙利亚代表团将弃权。他说，但是，决不应该认为这种行动就是叙利亚代表团不支持这个提案所提出的原则的表示。他又说，在联合国大会里讨论波兰提案，对于和平事业是重要的，但是，只有大国之间举行直接谈判才能更好地实现波兰提案所提出的目标。
    叙利亚代表强调说，阿拉伯国家支持制度不同的国家和平共处的原则，他又说，阿拉伯国家愿意与苏联和人民民主国家以及西方国家都维持正常的关系。
    最后，叙利亚代表表示支持巴西关于朝鲜问题的提案。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发言支持波兰代表团的提案。维辛斯基总结了政治委员会关于波兰提案的讨论，并指出那些公开反对通过波兰代表团提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的措施”提案的代表的论据已经破产。
    维辛斯基最后说：“至于巴西代表团所提出的关于朝鲜问题的提案，粗略看来，似乎是值得我们注意的。苏联代表团希望在比较详细地研究过这个提案以后，能够再就这个问题发言。”
    在休会以前，美国代表葛罗斯作了简短发言。和他第一次发言时一样，他为美国在裁减军备和武装部队问题上的立场辩解，并再度企图把北大西洋公约组织说成是为了实现联合国宪章中所规定的原则而成立的。他表示支持巴西关于朝鲜问题的提案。
