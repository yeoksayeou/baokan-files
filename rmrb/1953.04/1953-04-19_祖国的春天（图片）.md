Spring in the Motherland

	With the arrival of spring in 1953, workers at construction sites across the country are even busier. This is a construction site in the western suburbs of Beijing, where workers are building a large lake, two small islands, and a ring road around the lake. In a few years, this place will become a beautiful scenic spot.
