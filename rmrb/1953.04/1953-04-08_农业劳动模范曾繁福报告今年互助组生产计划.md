    Agricultural Labor Model Zeng Fanfu Reports on This Year's Mutual Aid Team Production Plan
    A letter from agricultural labor model Zeng Fanfu: Under the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government, our mutual aid team is now energetically preparing for spring plowing. This year, we are thoroughly eliminating conservative ideas and striving to learn new agricultural production techniques: seed selection, deep plowing, close planting, sparse sowing, reduced transplanting, and rational fertilization.
    Our mutual aid team has already formulated the 1953 production plan. 88.6 mu of land in the whole team will be converted to double-cropping rice fields. We aim to yield 1,600 jin per mu on six mu of high-yield land this year. The total fertilizer used by the team this year will increase by one-third compared to last year. When the mutual aid team was first organized last year, we only raised twelve pigs. In order to raise pigs to accumulate manure, we have now increased the number to thirty-four. We are leading the masses in the whole village to repair water conservancy facilities, ensuring that even if it doesn't rain for seventy days, not a single rice seedling will die from drought.

    农业劳动模范曾繁福报告今年互助组生产计划
    农业劳动模范曾繁福来信：在共产党和人民政府的关怀下，我们互助组现在正在起劲地做好春耕生产的准备工作。今年我们彻底清除保守思想，努力学习新的农业生产技术：选种、深耕、密植、稀播、少插和合理施肥。
    我们互助组已经订出了一九五三年的生产计划。全组有八十八亩六分地改为双季稻田。有六亩高产量地今年争取每亩打一千六百斤。今年全组的肥料要比去年增加三分之一。去年互助组刚组织起来时，只养十二只猪，为了养猪积肥，现在已增加到三十四只。我们带动全乡群众修好水利，保证假如七十天不下雨也不干死一颗稻禾。
