After Eisenhower came to power, at the beginning of this year, Brigadier General Le H. Gien, a senior American medical officer in Korea, received a special mission: because of the large number of American soldiers refusing to fight and deserting on the battlefield in Korea, the American military authorities asked the chief medical officer of the Eighth Army to conduct this "special study on the causes of cowardice."

Indeed, where exactly is the cause? Why, in the short span of half a month from October 20 to November 3, 1952, did the 65th Regiment of the U.S. Third Division, composed of Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican troops, experience four consecutive incidents of collective cowardice on the Korean front? Why did the most "elite" American units, such as the First Cavalry Division, the Second Infantry Division, the Twenty-Fourth Infantry Division, the Twenty-Fifth Infantry Division, and the Forty-Fifth Infantry Division, have "a considerable number" of desertion incidents occur “during the Korean War involving almost every American infantry division – as declared by Ransfield, the Judge Advocate of the Eighth Army”?

In order to investigate the "medical" reasons for these events, the elderly General Gien and his young subordinates were indeed busy for a while. A certain Lieutenant Littell, who claimed to be a "U.S. military psychology expert," spent three months studying the "behavior" and "responses to life" of American soldiers in U.S. military teams and isolated bunkers at the front lines. This "thirty-year-old army psychology expert" saw that American "front-line soldiers were governed by two completely different sets of rules"; namely: "One set is the rules completely issued by the military. According to military rules, soldiers should sacrifice themselves at any time, no matter how small the battle. But there is another set of rules informally stipulated by his platoon, which urges him not to sacrifice easily." Littell explained that in the front-line American units, "soldiers are more willing to abide by their own rules than to abide by military rules."

What a "smart" Littell. How could he see the whole truth? The "military rules" that the soldiers are unwilling to abide by are to make the soldiers sell their lives for Wall Street! And what are the soldiers' "own rules"? Let's listen to the voices of the American soldiers themselves.

Last Christmas Day, in a relatively concealed location of the American military position on White Horse Mountain in the central Korean front, American infantryman D. Guerrero, after eating cold Christmas turkey, leaned back on his canvas bed and slowly told Ernie Pyle, a reporter for International News Service: "This morning, when we were lying there preparing for the ambush, all I could think about was the midnight mass in the church in my hometown. What we hope for is to go back alive. I hope this group of people can go back alive, I am very scared."

This patient with "cowardice" spoke much more frankly than their captain doctor, Littell: "Hope...to go back alive. I am very scared." Yes, this probably reflects the source of the American soldiers' illness and their own rules.

Based on this source of illness and the general rules of the American soldiers, Brigadier General Gien announced his "diagnosis" conclusion to the International News Service reporters stationed in Seoul on January 31 of this year: He clearly stated that the "terror" of the front-line American troops "is contagious, and it can never be completely overcome." So, what should be done? Please, Mr. Gien!

Gien replied that his Eighth Army's "Medical Corps cannot implement a broad psychiatric treatment program to deal with possible events such as cowardice under enemy fire, disobedience to orders, and cowardice on the battlefield." Ah, so that's how it is! It turns out that the American authorities are still counting on the American military doctors to give "psychiatric treatment" to these "incidents of cowardice on the battlefield."

This is a misjudgment of the American soldiers with weak fighting spirit. They are neither mentally ill patients nor idiots and fools. If you don't believe it, please read the above-mentioned report sent by the International News Service reporter near White Horse Mountain in Korea last Christmas, and the truth will be clearer—

After the American soldier D. Guerrero said "I am very scared," a squad leader named Joseph E. Hagood next to him also spoke. The squad leader recalled the scene of spending Christmas with his family at home the year before, and said in an indignant tone to the surrounding companions:

"I think of the scene of reunion with my family, I curse Korea, I curse the cold here—he put his hands behind his head and continued—I seem to be worried about two places, my body is here, and my heart is at home. I have always been very 'alert' to protect my life..."

The telegram sent by the American news agency continued to write: At this time, when the American soldiers were shivering in the wet and cold air, the Chinese army's propaganda loudspeakers were broadcasting intermittent music from the no man's land. So, another automatic rifleman in this infantry squad, 21-year-old Private First Class Richard S. Smith, said with great emotion: "Whenever the music over there gradually fades away, I think of home, I seem to smell the aroma of my mother cooking..." Corporal Walter W. Needham, 22 (he is a curly-haired signalman), was lying next to his squad leader, stroking the telephone, and also muttered: "What I miss is my fiancee Mary, and my family..."

--This may be the reason why the U.S. Eighth Army recently implemented "new restrictions" on its war reporters (according to this new restriction, U.S. troops have been ordered to prohibit soldiers from talking to reporters without permission), because to some extent, some of the original materials in these news telegrams are much more direct than the observations of the "army psychology expert" Littell mentioned earlier. These reports, in addition to sometimes revealing the normal thought rules of American youths—irrevocable homesickness, sometimes strongly set off: the joyful and confident happy mood in our volunteer army positions is completely opposite to them. As UPI war correspondent Kenny said in a report on February 22 last year: When he was in the 65th Regiment of the U.S. Third Division, where four desertion incidents had occurred in half a month last year, Puerto Rican Lieutenant Correa led an outpost team to conduct reconnaissance activities in front of our army's position. Kenny wrote that when Correa's outpost team approached our army's front line at night, they set up their weapons and had the soldiers "lie down in the snow-covered place to wait."

Wait for what?

Kenny continued to write: "The Chinese army seems to be holding a celebration party in a very close place—Lieutenant Correa told the UPI reporter—they (referring to our People's Volunteers) are singing and are very happy."

This is just an ordinary day, and our positions are so cheerful. And how do the American troops spend their weekends or holidays? Or, when President Eisenhower held a luxurious dinner with Republican leaders in his headquarters room at the Commodore Hotel in New York, how did the American soldiers on the front lines spend their third New Year's Eve in Korea?

American soldiers raised iron cups filled with white water instead of beer in the frozen front-line bunkers... According to a report by International News Service reporter Ellegent from the Western Front on January 1: Many American soldiers at this time really couldn't say "there is anything worth looking back on—probably there is nothing to look forward to either"; because they deeply felt that their lives had been included in the number of casualties predetermined by decision-makers in Washington and Tokyo, then what practical significance would it have to think about "champagne, music, confetti, and white shoulders appearing under the soft light" on New Year's Eve?

So this report couldn't help but lament the future of those American soldiers: "Some people may never leave this mountain" (that is, they will be buried in Korea); and "other people, when celebrating the New Year next year, may be standing in the corner leaning on crutches, nervously watching other young people dance!"

What a desperate mood.

Even the enemy's chaplains believe that their soldiers "far from their families and original lives" have "become daydreamers." Like army chaplain Collins, he blames the American soldiers for now "having a lot of time to think." Another army chaplain, Lieutenant Douglas, has a different view: he believes that the reason for the American troops' low morale is because "there is no chance to fool around. The wine, women, and casual pleasures that could be found in Europe during World War II cannot be found in Korea." Obviously, Chaplain Douglas is deliberately saying the wrong thing.

Recent American reports have openly stated that the proportion of U.S. Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps soldiers who commit murder, rape, robbery, drug use, and other crimes is not a minority. Even those American "military court" officials who pretend in Korea feel that some of the cases they see are "very dirty" (see Associated Press Seoul February 21st telegram). A UPI New York telegram on January 29 said: Cardinal Spellman, who returned to Washington from the Korean front, believes that the Korean War's "most terrible aspect is the large number of young people using drugs." He said, "Doctors tell me that a large proportion of people are addicted to drugs." It can be seen that Chaplain Douglas is deliberately lying.

So, what is the real heart of the matter? Who sees the whole truth? Perhaps the old veteran chaplain Peterson, who has experienced two world wars, is right. According to his experience, he told the UPI reporter accompanying the U.S. 40th Division on January 27 this year: "The situation in the last war was: people only believe in religion when disaster is imminent"—and today, the American soldiers fighting in Korea, the opinions of the U.S. military chaplains are consistent: "They are more interested in religion than the soldiers during World War II."

Indeed, the International News Service telegram from the western Korean front on February 19 quickly provided a vivid proof of Chaplain Peterson's rich experience; this telegram wrote about the post-war interviews with wounded U.S. Marines. When those wounded soldiers talked about constantly "trembling" and "being afraid" when facing the enemy, they "started to pray"— pinning their hopes on religion; at the same time, "the first thought they had after being injured was to lie on the deck"—still wanting to go home, and nothing else.

American soldiers in the Korean War have been infected with a pervasive disease of defeatism and an incurable case of homesickness. Therefore, Captain Littell, a medical officer who has personally observed the current situation, clearly saw that the American soldiers in Korea have different feelings than those in World War II; he said: At that time, "every time a hill and a village were captured, for every soldier, it was a step on the road home." Littell said: The reason why "cowardice" incidents occur repeatedly in the U.S. military is because "the American troops in Korea feel that there is no reason to risk their lives to fight, because the result of his life and death in battle cannot make him go home sooner." Therefore, if viewed not from the perspective of the American military chaplain, but from the perspective of any clear-headed normal person, then neither prayer, nor women, nor alcoholism, morphine injections, and the rotation system, whether spiritual or physical anesthetics and corrosives, can save but only strengthen their disease. It is no wonder that Brigadier General Gien, the chief medical officer of the U.S. Eighth Army—(he is truly a serious person)—about a month after publishing his last "diagnosis," that is, on February 27, once again supplemented his "medical" insights to the International News Service reporter in Seoul. In this insight, he gave a conclusion to all the problems mentioned above, summarized all the serious phenomena and gave it a name, called "combat exhaustion"; yes, he admitted: "Now (he refers to the winter around February), there are some people suffering from combat exhaustion, but (he emphasized) they are definitely not found as much in fierce battles."

That's right, the main reason is about to be found. Brigadier General Gien's "medical" judgment coincides with the experience summarized by his colleague, the Judge Advocate of the Eighth Army. One of the important figures in the U.S. Eighth Army—Colonel Ransfield, the Judge Advocate, announced to Associated Press reporters in Seoul on January 28 that "almost all divisions often have many escape phenomena," while he also said: "There are many such incidents. These things happen when the war is fought most fiercely and our casualties are very heavy." The examples he cited to UPI reporter Woodieke and others in this regard are: In the U.S. military's so-called "autumn offensive" in October 1951, the U.S. military's First Cavalry Division, the U.S. Third Division, and part of the infantry of the Twenty-Fifth Division suffered serious setbacks due to attacks on the Iron Triangle area guarded by our Volunteer Army. During the same period, the U.S. Third Division suffered serious setbacks in attacking the "Heartbreak Ridge" guarded by the Korean People's Army in the eastern part of the central front (as everyone knows: the U.S. military's so-called "autumn offensive" of the previous year ended with its huge failure—a loss of 88,000 casualties); in addition, the U.S. Forty-Fifth Division also suffered a disastrous defeat in the "Old Baldy" battle in the central front in the summer and autumn of 1952;—in all the places where the U.S. military suffered serious disastrous defeats, the large-scale refusal to fight and collective desertion of American soldiers occurred uncontrollably.

Disastrous defeats led to desertion, and homesickness caused cowardice. Is the law of development of American military internal life, which has become particularly clear recently, just such a formula?

No, the busy American military doctors, the American military judge advocates with blood stains on their uniforms, the American reporters who are restricted from telling witty and vicious words, or the naive and "cowardly" American soldiers, and the responsible chaplains with military ranks, all say the reasons that they can understand or reveal on one side, which at best can only reflect the local truth; but they are not thorough and cannot become the scientific truth to answer and diagnose the American military's cowardice. What should the judgment of the truth be? Where exactly is the fundamental reason?

Let us consult Stalin. As early as February 16 two years ago, Comrade Stalin, in his conversation with a reporter from Pravda, talked about the quality of the American and British troops interfering in Korea and its outcome:

"Then where is the problem? The problem is that the soldiers believe that the war against Korea and China is an unjust war, while they believe that the war against Hitler's Germany and militarist Japan was a completely just war. The problem is that this war is extremely unpopular among American and British soldiers." "It is very clear that if the soldiers believe that the war they are forced to wage is extremely unjust, if the soldiers therefore only perform their duties formally on the front lines, neither believing in the justice of their mission nor having enthusiasm, then even the most experienced generals and officers will fail."

Remember these words! Every step of development in real life has completely confirmed these clear predictions and arguments of Comrade Stalin.

    原因到底在哪里呢
    黄钢
    艾森豪威尔上台以后，今年年初，在朝鲜的美国高级医官勒·赫·吉恩准将接到了一个特殊的任务：由于侵朝美军大批士兵拒绝作战，临阵逃亡的严重事件越来越多了，美军当局，就要求这位美军第八军军医长，进行这种“关于胆怯原因的专门研究”。
    真的，原因到底在什么地方呢？为什么从一九五二年十月二十日到十一月三日，短短的半个月之间，美军第三师六十五团讲西班牙语的波多黎各军队，在朝鲜前线接连发生了四次集体临阵胆怯的事件呢？为什么美国最“精锐”的部队，如骑兵第一师、步兵第二师、第二十四师、二十五师、以及步兵第四十五师，“在朝鲜战场期间差不多所有的美国步兵师——就像第八军军法官兰斯菲尔德所宣称的这样——都有‘相当多的’临阵逃亡的事件”发生呢？
    为了查明这种事件“医学”上的原因，上了年纪的吉恩将军跟他年青的下手们，可真是忙碌了一阵。一位据称是“美军心理学专家”的立特尔上尉，为了这事，竟在美军的团队和前线美军孤立的地堡中，对美军士兵的“举止行为”和“对生活的反应”研究了三个月；这位“三十岁的军队心理学专家”看出了美军“前线士兵被两套完全不同的规则所支配着”；这就是：“一套完全是军方所发布的规则。根据军方规则，士兵应该随时牺牲，不论战斗多么小。但是有另一套由他的班非正式规定的规则，则力促他不要轻易牺牲。”立特尔解释道：在前线的美军部队，“更愿意遵守他们自己的规则，而不大肯遵守军方规则。”
    好一个“聪明”的立特尔，他哪能看出事情的全部真象？所谓士兵不愿意遵守的“军方的规则”，就是要士兵们为华尔街去卖命呵！而所谓士兵们“自己的规则”是什么呢？听一听美国士兵们自己的声音吧。
    去年圣诞节这一天，在朝鲜中部战线白马山美军阵地的较隐蔽处，美国步兵德·盖罗在吃过了冰凉的圣诞节火鸡之后，仰身躺在帆布床上，对美国国际新闻社记者埃·德·希马夫慢慢地谈道：“今天早晨，当我们躺在那里预备伏击的时候，我脑子里只在想，我家乡那个教区的教堂里在午夜时举行弥撒的情形。我们希望的，就是活命回去。我希望这一伙人都能活命回去，我很害怕。”
    这一位“胆怯病”患者，比他们的上尉医官立特尔，讲得坦率多了：“希望……活命回去。我很害怕”是的，这大概就反映了美军士兵们的病源和自己的规则吧。
    根据这样的病源和美军士兵们这种一般性的规则，吉恩准将把他“专门研究”的结果，在今年一月三十一日对驻汉城的国际新闻社记者发表了一个他的“诊断”的结论：他明明白白地说，前线美军的“恐怖是带来传染性的，它永远不能完全被克服。”那么，应该怎么办呢？请问吉恩先生！
    吉恩回答道：他那第八军的“军医处无法实行广泛的精神病治疗计划，以对付可能发生的在敌人炮火下胆怯、不服从命令和临阵胆怯等事件。”啊，原来是这样！原来美军当局，还指望美国军医，对这等“临阵胆怯等事件”，给它以“精神病治疗”哩。
    这是把斗志薄弱的美军士兵看错了。他们既不是精神病患者，也不是白痴与傻瓜。如若不信，请将上面列举过的、国际新闻社记者去年圣诞节在朝鲜白马山附近发出的那篇报道看完，真象就比较明白了——
    在美国士兵德·盖罗说过“我很害怕”之后，他身旁的一位名叫约瑟夫·伊·哈古德的步兵班长，也发话了。班长联想起前年在家里与家人共度圣诞节的情形，对周围的伙伴们发出了愤恨的语调，他讲道：
    “我想起和家人团聚的情形，我咀咒朝鲜，我咀咒这里的寒冷——他把双手放在脑后，又继续说——我好像心挂双地，身在这里，心在家里。我向来都在很‘机警’地注意保守我的生命……”
    美国的通讯社所发出的这篇电讯继续写道：在这时候，当美军士兵在湿而且冷的空气里冻得发抖的时候，北面，中国军队的宣传扩音器，却把断断续续的音乐声，从无人地带那边播送过来。于是，这个步兵班里的另一自动枪手，二十一岁的一等兵理查德·斯·史密斯，就感伤倍至地说道：“每当那边的音乐声渐渐小下去的时候，我就想起家来，我好像闻到妈妈在做饭时的一股一股香味……”二十二岁的下士华尔脱·吴·尼德罕姆（他是一个头发卷曲的通讯兵）这时正躺在他的班长身旁，抚弄着电话机，也念念有词地说道：“我所挂念的是我的未婚妻玛丽，以及我的家人们……”
    ——这也许就是美国第八军最近对它的战地记者要实施“新的限制”的理由吧（根据这新限制，美军已奉令禁止士兵未经许可而和记者谈话），因为在某种程度上说，这些新闻电讯里的一部分原始资料，比前面“军队心理专家”立特尔的观察，要直接得多了。这些报道中除了有时透露出美军青年们正常的思想规则——不可挽救的怀乡病以外，有时又强烈地对衬出：我们志愿军阵地里完全与他们相反的、充满了欢欣鼓舞和信心百倍的快乐情绪。如合众社随军记者肯尼在去年二月二十二日报道中说：当他在那个去年半个月之间发生过四次临阵逃亡的美军第三师六十五区团时候，波多黎各中尉柯里阿带领了一个前哨队，到我军阵地前沿进行斥候活动。肯尼写道：柯里阿的前哨队黑夜中走近我军阵线时，就架好武器并且让士兵们“伏在铺满了雪的地方等待着。”
    等到了什么呢？
    肯尼续写道：“在很近地方的中国军队好像在举行一个庆祝晚会——柯里阿中尉对合众社记者说——他们（——指我人民志愿军）唱着歌，快乐得很。”
    这不过是一个平常的日子，我们阵地里就是那样的欢快。而美军呢，他们是怎样度过他们的周末或假日呢？或者说，当艾森豪威尔总统在纽约康摩多旅馆他的总部房间内与共和党首领们举行豪华的晚餐时，前线的美军士兵，是怎样度过在朝鲜的第三个除夕日的呢？
    美国士兵们在冰冻的最前沿地堡内，举起盛白水的铁杯，来代替啤酒……据国际新闻社记者埃利根特一月一日自西线报道：很多的美军士兵们到这时是真正说不上“有什么值得回顾的事——大概也没有什么可期待的了”；因为他们既然深感到自己的性命已被划在华盛顿和东京决策人预定要死伤的数目字之中，那么，就是在除夕再去想那些“香槟酒、音乐、五彩碎纸，以及白色的肩膀在柔和的灯光下出现”，那又有什么实际意义呢？
    于是这报道中对那些美军士兵的未来不禁悲叹道：“有些人也许永远离不开这个山头了”（就是说：他们会葬身在朝鲜）；而“其它的人，在明年过年的时候，也许会倚着拐杖站在角落里，紧张地望着别的小伙子跳舞吧！”
    多么绝望的情绪呵。
    连敌方的随军牧师们，都认为他们“远离了家庭和原来生活”的士兵们是“变成空想家了”。像军中牧师科林士，他责怪美军士兵们现在“有很多的时间去思想”。而另一位军中牧师道格拉斯少尉，却抱有另一番见解：他认为美军情绪消沉的理由，是因为“没有随意胡来的机会，第二次世界大战在欧洲可以找到的那些酒、女人和随便乱来的快乐，在朝鲜都找不到。”显然，这位道格拉斯牧师是故意把话说错了。
    美方近来的报道都公开在说：美国的陆军、空军和海军陆战队士兵，犯谋杀、强奸、抢劫、吸食毒品和其它罪行的人数比例，不是占其少数。连那些在朝鲜装模作样的美国“军事法庭”官员，对他们看见的有些案子都觉得“非常肮脏”（见美联社汉城二月二十一日电）。合众社一月二十九日纽约电讯说：从朝鲜前线回华盛顿的红衣主教斯培尔曼认为：朝鲜战争“最可怕的一个方面是青年吸食毒品人数之多”，他说：“医生告诉我，吸食毒品上了瘾的人占很大的比例”。可见，牧师道格拉斯是在存心撒谎了。
    那么，到底什么原因才是问题的中心呢？是谁看到了事情的全部真象呢？也许是身经两次大战的老资格的牧师皮特逊说的对吧，根据他的经验，他在今年一月二十七日对合众社随美军第四十师记者说：“上次大战时的情形是：人在大难临头时才信仰宗教”——而今天在朝鲜作战的美国军人呢，美军军中牧师们的意见是一致的：“要比第二次世界大战时的军人们对于宗教更感兴趣了。”
    确实，国际新闻社二月十九日的朝鲜西线电讯，是迅速地对牧师皮特逊的丰富经验给予了生动的证明；这则电讯写的是美国海军陆战队伤兵的战后访问，那些伤兵们讲自己临阵时不断地“颤抖”与“害怕”时，就“开始做祷告”——对宗教寄托希望；同时，他们负伤后“第一个想起的念头是躺在甲板上”——还是想回家，此外，再没什么别的了。
    在朝鲜战争中的美国士兵，已经染上了贯穿周身的失败主义病症，和不可挽救的怀乡病。因此，亲身观察过现况的医官立特尔上尉，明显地看出了在朝鲜的美军士兵跟在第二次世界大战时的心情不同；他说：那时候“每攻下一个山头和一个乡村，对于每个士兵来说，就是在回家的路程上走了一步。”立特尔说：美军中“胆怯”事件之所以连连发生，是因为“在朝鲜的美军认为没有理由值得拚命打仗，因为他在战斗中出生入死的结果并不能使他早日回家”。因此，如果不是从美国随军牧师的角度，而是用任何一个头脑清醒的正常人的眼光看来，那就无论是祷告，无论是女人、无论是酗酒、吗啡针和轮换制，无论是精神上和肉体上的麻醉剂与腐蚀剂，都不能挽救而只能加强他们的病症了。难怪美国第八军的军医长吉恩准将——（他真是一个堪称认真的人物）——在发表了他上一次的“诊断”约一个月之后，就是二月二十七日，在汉城，又一次地对国际新闻社记者补充了他的“医学”上的见解，这篇见解里他给上面说到的种种毛病统统下了一个结论，归结了以上所有严重的现象并给它起了一个名字，叫做“战斗衰竭症”；是的，他承认了：“现在（他指在二月左右的冬季里），是有一些患战斗衰竭症的人，但是（他着重地说）决没有在激烈的战斗中发现的那么多。”
    对了，主要的原因快要找到了。吉恩准将“医学”上的判断，跟他的同僚第八军军法官所归结的经验是不谋而合了。美国第八军里的重要人物之一——军法官蓝斯菲尔德上校一月二十八日在汉城对美联社记者等宣布“差不多所有的师都时常有许多逃跑现象”的时候，同时他也说道：“这样的事件是很多的。这些事都发生在战事打得最激烈而且我方死伤很重的时候。”他对合众社记者伍迪克等人举到的这方面例子是：一九五一年十月在美军的所谓“秋季攻势”中，美军的骑兵第一师、美军的第三师和第二十五师的一部分步兵，因攻击我志愿军扼守的铁原三角地带严重受挫，同一时期，美军第三师在中线东部攻击朝鲜人民军所扼守的“伤心岭”严重受挫（众所周知：美军前年的所谓“秋季攻势”，是以它巨大的失败——伤亡共八万八千人的损失而结束）；此外，就是美军第四十五师在一九五二年夏秋在中线“老秃山”战役中也遭到惨败；——所有以上凡美军受到严重惨败的地方，大批美国士兵们的拒绝作战和临阵集体逃亡，就不可遏止地发生了。
    惨败带来了逃亡，思乡就引起了胆怯，难道在近来特别鲜明起来了的美军内部生活发展的规律，就仅仅是这样的公式吗？
    不，忙碌不休的美国军医们、军服上沾染有血迹的美军军法官、被限制的讲俏皮话和恶毒话语的美国记者、或者是稚弱而又是“胆怯”的美国的士兵、还有那带着军阶的责任重大的牧师，都说出了各人所能够理解或吐露的一方面的原因，充其量也仅只能是反映出局部的真情实况；但都不彻底，也不能成为答复与诊断美军胆怯病情的科学的真理；真理的判断应该是怎样呢？根本的原因倒底在哪里呢？
    让我们请教斯大林吧。早在两年前的二月十六日，斯大林同志在对真理报记者发表的谈话中，谈到干涉朝鲜的美英军队质量问题及其结局时说道：
    “那末问题在什么地方呢？问题在于士兵们认为对朝鲜和中国的战争是非正义的战争，而他们认为对希特勒德国和军国主义日本的战争是完全正义的战争。问题在于这个战争在美国的和英国的士兵中是极端不得人心的。”“这是很清楚的，如果士兵们认为强迫他们进行的战争是极端非正义的，如果士兵们因此而在前线上只是形式上执行职务，既不相信他们的使命合乎正义，也没有热情，那末就是最有经验的将领和军官也要失败。”
    记住这些话吧！现实生活中的每一步发展，将斯大林同志这些鲜明的预见和论断，完全给以证实了。
