    Commenting on the Illegal Resolution of the UN General Assembly's Political Committee
    The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee, under the manipulation of the United States, has passed a so-called proposal for a "fair investigation into the accusations regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by American troops." This is unreasonable and illegal. The Chinese and Korean people and all people who uphold fairness and justice in the world absolutely do not recognize that this resolution has any validity.
    The Soviet delegation repeatedly put forward the just suggestion to invite representatives from China and Korea to participate in the discussion of this proposal. This suggestion was supported by representatives from countries such as Poland and Indonesia, but the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee unreasonably rejected it. This is completely without reason. From the perspective of the fact that the United States is conducting bacteriological warfare, the people of China and Korea are the victims; from a legal point of view, since the United States and its lackeys have admitted that this case is an accusation by China and Korea against the United States, the people of China and Korea are naturally the plaintiffs in this accusation. What reason is there not to allow the victims and plaintiffs to attend and provide evidence and opinions regarding this case before unilaterally passing a resolution? The United States representative to the United Nations, Gross, delivered a lengthy speech slandering the accusations made by the Soviet Union and the Chinese and Korean people against the United States as "lies"; American generals who personally arranged the bacteriological warfare, such as Ridgway and Clark, also swore to heaven that they had not conducted bacteriological warfare. Since this is the case, why not dare to let representatives from China and Korea attend the meeting to confront them? What other explanation could there be for this other than, as the Chinese saying goes, "a guilty conscience"? As early as last October 27th, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, solemnly telegraphed Pearson, the President of the UN General Assembly, pointing out that "without the participation of representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, any discussion and decision by the Assembly regarding the so-called investigation of accusations against the United States for conducting bacteriological warfare would be illegal and therefore invalid." This is an extremely powerful prior response to the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee.
    What is the reason for the so-called five-nation committee to "travel freely" to North and South Korea and mainland China, to bring American prisoners of war who admit to using bacteriological weapons to a "neutral zone" for them to be "interrogated," and to hand these prisoners of war over to a "United Nations committee for safekeeping" before the end of the war? People all over the world know that the U.S. government conducted bacteriological warfare in northern Korea and northeastern China. The people of China and Korea have not only obtained irrefutable material evidence and personal testimony, but it has also been repeatedly verified by authoritative world scientists, jurists, and public leaders. The "Investigation Group of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers," including representatives of legal workers from Austria, Italy, Brazil, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Poland, and other countries, successively investigated in Korea and northeastern China from March 3rd to April 2nd last year; the "International Scientific Commission for Investigating the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," composed of world-renowned scientists from Sweden, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Brazil, the Soviet Union, and other countries, also conducted on-the-spot investigations and serious research in China and Korea from the end of June to the beginning of August last year; well-known public leaders from various countries, such as the Dean of Canterbury Johnson, Wen Youzhang, Faji, and Mrs. Felton, all personally went to the places they wanted to go to inspect, interviewed anyone they needed to interview, and read all kinds of documents and materials they needed. These groups and individuals conducted fair investigations with an objective attitude, as the report of the International Scientific Commission said: "The members of the commission, realizing the importance of their responsibility, tried their best to get rid of preconceived ideas, and followed the strictest scientific principles they knew with the highest degree of objectivity to conduct the investigation." "The members all made themselves vigilant against any political, ethical, or emotional influences, so the work of the commission was carried out in a calm, scientific, and objective atmosphere." With this most rigorous, objective, and scientific attitude, they questioned hundreds of witnesses from different professions, including a captured spy and four captured American airmen, examined countless exhibits, and finally fully confirmed the crime of the United States in conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. The U.S. government officials and generals, in response to the evidence listed in the documents published by these investigation teams, have never produced any facts to refute even the smallest detail, apart from empty denials. The U.S. government is clearly afraid to face the facts published by the on-the-spot investigations of these world-renowned scientists, jurists, and public leaders.
    More importantly, there are the confessions of captured American airmen who personally flew planes to spread bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, and the confessions of captured senior American air force officers who personally deployed and commanded the bacteriological warfare according to the orders of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. These confessions confirmed that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff secretly issued an order to conduct bacteriological warfare in Korea in October 1951. These confessions identified the names of the U.S. officers who conveyed the order to conduct bacteriological warfare to them, identified the several meetings held by the U.S. side to arrange bacteriological warfare and the content of the lectures teaching U.S. Air Force personnel how to use bacteriological weapons, identified the names of the air force bases where bacteriological warfare was conducted and the types of aircraft and their departure times, and identified the forms of various bacteriological bombs and the techniques for dropping bacteriological bombs. Every detail they confessed was very specific and accurate. Since the U.S. representative said that these were all "propaganda" and "lies," why have no officials and officers of the U.S. government, including Gross and the people identified in the confessions, dared to come out and correct any of these facts until now? According to the Associated Press, a person who saw the film recording the confessions of American prisoners of war said: "In the film, these air force personnel talk about the mission of bacteriological warfare, they say who instructed them on this mission at home and abroad, and they say how high they flew and where they dropped the bacterial containers." "This shows that the Americans personally said these accusations." The U.S. government and its representatives cannot refute these living testimonies at all, and even try to avoid talking about this ironclad evidence at the UN General Assembly, and attempt to take illegal resolutions to carry out some kind of "investigation." Isn't this too ridiculous!
    The U.S. government's attempt to conduct a so-called "fair investigation" clearly has ulterior motives. This is that they are trying to use this investigation to investigate the effects of their evil bacteriological warfare. On the Korean battlefield, the U.S. side sent many spies to infiltrate our side to conduct investigations, but they were all captured by the Chinese and Korean People's Army; the United States also attempted to send their puppet International Committee of the Red Cross to conduct an "investigation," but it was also sternly rejected by China and Korea. Now, the United States is again attempting to conduct such an "investigation" in the name of the United Nations without the participation of representatives from China and Korea. We, the people of China and Korea, firmly oppose this.
    We believe that if the United Nations respects its responsibilities and safeguards the United Nations Charter from any damage, it must first condemn the U.S. government for its planned crime of conducting bacteriological warfare, and take effective measures to prohibit the use of bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and urge the governments of all countries that have not yet ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of the Use of Poison Gas or Similar Poisons and Bacteriological Methods of Warfare to immediately ratify this protocol. The U.S. government is one of the governments that has not yet ratified this protocol. In this regard, the U.S. government is the same as the Japanese government. The Beria trial has publicly exposed that the reason why Japan did not ratify the Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of the Use of Poison Gas and Bacteriological Weapons was to conduct bacteriological warfare in the war of aggression against China. Why hasn't the United States ratified it? According to former U.S. President Truman, this convention is "outdated," but the facts prove that the reason why the United States has not ratified it is because the United States intends to conduct bacteriological warfare. Before the start of the Korean War and during the continuation of the war, the United States was filled with the noise of bacteriological warfare. Many important U.S. officials have boasted about the "effectiveness" of U.S. bacteriological shells and bombs, which is well known. Shouldn't this be condemned immediately!
    The United Nations does not condemn the U.S. government for its blatant violation of international conventions, but instead wants to do some kind of "investigation," which is extremely unfair, and we will definitely oppose it.

    评联大政治委员会的非法决议
    联合国大会政治委员会在美国操纵下，通过了所谓“公正调查关于美国军队使用细菌武器的控诉”的提案，这是无理的和非法的。中朝人民和全世界主持公理和正义的人们绝对不承认这个决议有任何的效力。
    苏联代表团一再地提出了邀请朝中两国代表参加讨论这个提案的公正建议，这个建议受到波兰、印尼等国代表的支持，但是联合国大会政治委员会竟无理地加以拒绝。这是毫无道理的。从美国进行细菌战这一事实来说，朝中两国人民是受害者；从法律观点来说，美国及其仆从们既然承认了这一案是朝中两国对美国的控诉，则朝中两国人民当然是这一控诉案的原告。究竟有什么理由不让受害者和原告出席提供关于这一案件的证据和意见就片面通过决议呢？美国驻联合国的代表葛罗斯发表了冗长的演说，诬蔑苏联和朝中人民对美国的指控为“谎言”；美国亲手布置细菌战的将军如李奇微、克拉克等，也曾指天咒地说他们没有进行过细菌战。既然是这样，为什么不敢让朝中两国代表出席会议来对证呢？这除了像中国俗话说的“做贼心虚”以外，还能有什么解释呢？我中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来早在去年十月二十七日就曾致电联大主席皮尔逊郑重声明，指出“没有中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表参加，大会任何关于所谓调查指控美国进行细菌战的讨论和决定都将是非法的，因而是无效的。”这对于现在联合国大会政治委员会所通过的非法决议是一个极其有力的事先的回答。
    所谓五国委员会要到南北朝鲜、中国大陆等地“自由旅行”，要把承认使用细菌武器的美国战俘带到“中立区去”由他们“询问”，并且要把这些战俘在战争结束之前交给“联合国委员会来代管”，这有什么理由呢？全世界人民都知道，美国政府在朝鲜北部和我国东北等地进行细菌战，朝中两国人民不但早已获得了无可辩驳的物证和人证，而且早就经过世界权威的科学家、法学家和社会公众领袖多次调查证实了。包括奥地利、意大利、巴西、英国、法国、比利时、波兰等国法律工作者代表在内的“国际民主法律工作者协会调查团”曾于去年三月三日至四月二日先后到朝鲜和中国东北等地调查；由瑞典、法国、英国、意大利、巴西、苏联等国世界闻名的科学家组成的“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”于去年六月底至八月初也到中国和朝鲜进行了实地的调查和认真的研究；各国著名的社会公众领袖如坎特伯雷教长约翰逊、文幼章、法奇、费尔顿夫人等都曾亲到他们所想要到的地方去视察，访问了他们所需要访问的任何人，阅读了他们所需要的各种文件和材料。这些团体和个人都用客观的态度做了公正的调查，正如国际科学委员会的报告书所说：“委员会的委员们，认识到他们的责任之重大，尽力摆脱先入之见，以最高度的客观态度，遵循他们所知道的最严格的科学原则，从事调查。”“委员们都使他们自己警惕着，不受任何政治的、伦理的或感情的影响，因此委员会的工作是在一种冷静的科学的客观的气氛中进行的。”他们用这样最严格的客观的、科学的态度，询问了数百个不同职业的人证，包括一个被俘的特务和四个被俘的美国空军人员，审验了无数的证物，最后完全证实了美国在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行。美国政府的官员和将军们对于这些调查团所公布的文件中所列举的证据，除了空口抵赖之外，从来没有拿出事实来驳倒其中的任何最小的一个细节，美国政府显然不敢正视这些世界权威的科学家、法学家和社会公众领袖实地调查所公布的事实。
    更重要的是亲手驾着飞机在朝鲜和中国撒布细菌武器的被俘美国空军人员和亲自根据美国参谋长联席会议的命令来部署与指挥细菌战的被俘的美国空军高级军官的口供。这些口供证实了美国参谋长联席会议在一九五一年十月就秘密发下了在朝鲜进行细菌战的命令。这些口供指证了向他们传达进行细菌战命令的美国军官们的姓名，指证了美方为布置细菌战而召开的几个会议和训练美国空军人员使用细菌武器的授课内容，指证出进行细菌战的空军基地名称和飞机的类型及其出动时间，指证了各种细菌弹的形式和投掷细菌弹的技术。他们所供述的每一项细节都是非常具体和准确的。美国代表既然说这些都是“宣传”，是“谎言”，为什么美国政府的官员和军官们，连同葛罗斯以及供词中所指证有关的人们在内，直到现在为止还没有一个人敢于出来更正其中的任何一件事实呢？据合众社报道看过纪录美国战俘口供电影的人说：“在电影中，这些空军人员讲出细菌战的任务，他们说出在国内与国外是谁指示他们这种任务的，并说出他们飞得多高、他们在什么地方投掷细菌容器。”“这说明美国人是亲口说出这些指责的。”美国政府及其代表对于这些活生生的证人证词，不但不能做一句反驳，而且在联合国大会上对于这些铁的证据也极力避而不谈，而企图采取非法的决议来进行什么“调查”，这不是太可笑了吗！
    美国政府企图进行所谓“公正调查”，显然还有不可告人的目的。这就是他们企图藉此调查他们所进行的罪恶的细菌战的效果。在朝鲜战场上，美方曾派出许多特务潜入我方进行调查，但是都被朝中人民部队所捕获；美国也曾企图派遣他们御用的红十字国际委员会来进行“调查”，也被朝中方面严正拒绝了。现在美国又企图在没有中朝两国代表参加的情形下，用联合国的名义来进行这样的“调查”，我们中朝两国人民坚决反对。
    我们认为：如果联合国尊重自己的职责，维护联合国宪章不使受到任何破坏，那就必须首先谴责美国政府有计划进行细菌战的罪行，并采取有效措施，禁止使用细菌武器及其他大规模毁灭人类的武器，促使所有尚未批准一九二五年日内瓦关于禁用毒气或类似毒品及细菌方法作战议定书的国家的政府立即批准这个议定书。美国政府就是至今还没有批准这个议定书的政府之一。在这一点上，美国政府和日本政府是一样的。伯力审判中已经公开暴露了日本所以不批准关于禁用毒气和细菌武器的日内瓦议定书，就是为着在侵略中国的战争中进行细菌战。美国为什么不批准呢？据美国前任总统杜鲁门说，这个公约“已经过时”了，但是事实证明美国所以不批准是因为美国蓄意进行细菌战的缘故。在朝鲜战争开始以前和在战争继续进行的这个期间，美国国内一直充满了细菌战的喧嚷。许多美国重要官员都曾夸耀过美国细菌炮弹和炸弹的“效果”，这是人所共知的。这难道不应该立即加以谴责吗！
    联合国对于美国公然违犯国际公约的行为不加以谴责，而要做什么“调查”，这就是极大的不公正，我们就一定反对。
