Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 11th: The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company will open a new air route within Xinjiang, from Ürümqi to Kashgar, to improve transportation between the northern and southern parts of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang Province. A route surveying team, composed of Ma Rui (Chinese side), Deputy Director of the Lanzhou-Almaty line management office of Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company, and Lemin (Soviet side), Chief Ground Engineer, departed from Ürümqi on the 8th to begin work. They will select airport locations and design airport construction projects along the route. It is expected that this route will be open to traffic on July 1st this year.

Kashgar is the political, economic, and cultural center of southern Xinjiang, more than 3,000 li away from Ürümqi. Kashgar and Ürümqi are separated by the Tianshan Mountains and the vast Gobi Desert, making transportation very inconvenient; a round trip by car takes more than a month. After the opening of the Ürümqi-Kashgar route, a round trip by plane will only take nine hours, greatly facilitating communication between southern Xinjiang and Ürümqi.

Prior to the opening of the Ürümqi-Kashgar route, the Lanzhou-Almaty route had already been opened to traffic in 1950. This route connects Hami in eastern Xinjiang, Yining in western Xinjiang, and Ürümqi.

Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company has reduced passenger and freight rates on the Northwest Line from April 1st. The Beijing-Lanzhou section has been reduced by 39 percent, the Lanzhou-Ürümqi section by 12 percent, and the full Beijing-Ürümqi line fare has been reduced by 17.2 percent. This will promote economic and cultural exchanges between the Northwest and other regions.

    中苏民用航空公司将开辟迪化到喀什新航线
    【新华社西安十一日电】中苏民用航空公司将要在新疆境内开辟一条从迪化到喀什的新航线，沟通新疆省天山南北地区的交通。由中苏民航公司兰州阿拉木图线管理处副处长马瑞（中方）、地面总工程师列明（苏方）等组成的航线勘察组，已在八日从迪化出发工作。他们将在沿线选择机场和设计机场建筑工程。预计这一航线可在今年七月一日通航。
    喀什是新疆南部的政治、经济和文化中心，离迪化有三千多里。喀什和迪化之间有天山、大戈壁滩阻隔，交通很不方便，乘汽车往返一次要一个多月。迪、喀航线开辟以后，乘飞机往返只要九个小时，新疆南部和迪化之间的联系将大为便利。
    在迪、喀线通航之前，兰州、阿拉木图线早已在一九五○年通航。这条航线已把新疆东部的哈密、西部的伊宁和迪化连结起来。
    【新华社十一日讯】中苏民航公司已从四月一日起降低西北线客货运价。北京到兰州段降低百分之三十九，兰州到迪化段降低百分之十二，北京到迪化全线运价降低百分之十七点二。这将促进西北和其他地区的经济、文化交流。
