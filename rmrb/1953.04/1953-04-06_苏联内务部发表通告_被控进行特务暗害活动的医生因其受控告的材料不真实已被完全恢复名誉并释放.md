    Announcement by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs
    Doctors Accused of Espionage and Assassination Activities Fully Rehabilitated and Released Due to Untrue Accusations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th] TASS Moscow, April 4th: Today, newspapers published the following announcement from the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs:
    The Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs has meticulously examined the preliminary investigation materials and other materials related to the case of the group of doctors accused of sabotage, espionage, and acts of terror against active figures of the Soviet state.

    As a result of the examination, it has been determined that the arrest of the following defendants in this case by the former Soviet Ministry of State Security was incorrect and without any reasonable basis. These defendants are: Professor M.S. Vovsi, Professor V.N. Vinogradov, Professor M.B. Kogan, Professor B.B. Kegan, Professor P.I. Yegorov, Professor A.I. Feldman, Professor E.G. Etinger, Professor V.Kh. Vasilenko, Professor A.M. Grinshtein, Professor V.F. Selenin, Professor B.S. Preobrazhensky, Professor N.A. Popova, Professor V.V. Sakusov, Professor N.A. Shereshevsky, and Dr. G.I. Maiorov.

    The examination has shown that the accusations against the aforementioned individuals are untrue, and the evidence relied upon by the investigators is unfounded. It has been established that the so-called confessions of guilt made by the arrested individuals were obtained by the staff of the former State Security Ministry's interrogation department using interrogation methods that are not permitted by Soviet law and are strictly prohibited.

    Based on the conclusions of the investigation committee specially established by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs to examine this case, M.S. Vovsi, V.N. Vinogradov, B.B. Kogan, P.I. Yegorov, A.I. Feldman, V.Kh. Vasilenko, A.M. Grinshtein, V.F. Selenin, B.S. Preobrazhensky, N.A. Popova, V.V. Sakusov, N.A. Shereshevsky, G.I. Maiorov, and others involved in this case who were accused of sabotage, terror, and espionage activities have been fully rehabilitated and released from detention in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 5 of the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

    Those responsible for the incorrect interrogation have been arrested and will be held criminally liable.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th] TASS Moscow, April 4th: Today, newspapers reported that, in view of the actual circumstances that have now been clarified, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has decided to revoke the order of January 20, 1953, awarding the Order of Lenin to Dr. Lydia Timashuk, as this order was incorrect.

    苏联内务部发表通告
    被控进行特务暗害活动的医生因其受控告的材料不真实已被完全恢复名誉并释放
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日电：今天各报刊载了苏联内务部的通告如下：
    苏联内务部已把被控进行破坏、间谍活动和对苏维埃国家的积极活动家施行恐怖手段的医生集团一案的预审材料和其他材料做了精密的检查。
    由于检查的结果，已经确定：这一案件所牵涉的被告麦·斯·沃夫西教授、维·恩·维诺格拉多夫教授、麦·勃·科甘教授、勃·勃·科甘教授、普·伊·叶高罗夫教授、阿·伊·费德曼教授、叶·格·艾丁格尔教授、维·赫·瓦西连科教授、阿·麦·格林希坦因教授、维·弗·塞列宁教授、布·斯·普列奥布拉任斯基教授、纳·阿·波波娃教授、维·维·萨库索夫教授、纳·阿·谢列谢夫斯基教授和格·伊·马伊奥罗夫医生被前苏联国家保安部逮捕是不正确的，是没有任何合理根据的。
    检查已表明，对上列人等的控告是不真实的，而侦讯工作人员所依凭的证明材料是没有根据的。已经确定：被捕者所做的那些所谓证实其罪行的供词，是前国家保安部侦讯部门的工作人员用苏维埃法律所不允许并极严厉地禁止的侦讯方法获得的。
    根据苏联内务部为检查这一案件而特设的侦讯委员会的结论，被控告进行破坏、恐怖和间谍活动的麦·斯·沃夫西、维·恩·维诺格拉多夫、勃·勃·科甘、普·伊·叶高罗夫、阿·伊·费德曼、维·赫·瓦西连科、阿·麦·格林希坦因、维·弗·塞列宁、布·斯·普列奥布拉任斯基、纳·阿·波波娃、维·维·萨库索夫、纳·阿·谢列谢夫斯基、格·伊·马伊奥罗夫和本案所牵涉的其他的人已被完全恢复名誉，并已根据俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国刑事诉讼法第四条第五款由拘留所释放。
    因进行了不正确的侦讯而犯罪的人已予逮捕并使其负刑事责任。
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日电：今天各报报道，鉴于目前已经查明的实际情况，苏联最高苏维埃主席团决定撤销一九五三年一月二十日关于奖给丽佳·季马舒克医生列宁勋章的命令，因为这项命令是不正确的。
