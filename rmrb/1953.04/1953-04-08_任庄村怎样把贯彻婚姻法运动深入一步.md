    Before Ren Zhuang Village, in the Seventh District of Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, launched the Marriage Law implementation movement, there was not a single truly free marriage in the entire village. The masses had many misunderstandings about the Marriage Law, such as saying that the Marriage Law was a "divorce law," a "women's law," that being in love was "messing around," that implementing the Marriage Law meant going to the district to "register" and "meet," that gender equality meant "men and women doing the same amount of work"; their understanding of establishing democratic, harmonious, and united production families was also very vague; they were not clear about the launch of the Marriage Law implementation movement. For example, Liang Fa'niang (a widow) asked the district cadre: "Are all widows to be forced to remarry after the first month?" Those with problems themselves were even more panicked and afraid. Young men and women, especially unmarried young men and women, strongly supported the implementation of the Marriage Law, hoping that this movement would be successful and lay a solid foundation for a happy marriage in the future.
    After being trained, the village cadres returned to the village, comprehensively explained the policies to the masses, correctly clarified the nature and guidelines of the movement, eliminated the masses' concerns, stabilized people's minds, and began to reverse the incorrect views on the Marriage Law.
    After widespread publicity, the masses generally distinguished the boundaries between the old and new marriage systems, their awareness was raised to a certain extent, they expressed support for the new marriage system, and asked for further understanding of specific issues. For example, Han Lu'lin said: "I very much agree with the prohibition of concubinage, because that is for the landlords to enjoy themselves; but I can't understand the prohibition of child brides, because both parties are poor. The child bride's family can't afford to feed her, and sending her out as a child bride can prevent her from starving to death; the man can't find a wife, and when the child bride grows up, she can take care of the family, what's wrong with that?" The masses also raised many specific questions, mainly: (1) Questions about policies: such as "Must widows bring property when they remarry?" "What should be done with previous child brides?" "Why should child brides be prohibited?" etc. (2) Questions about establishing democratic and harmonious families: such as "The new marriage system is good, how can it be achieved?" "How can a democratic family be established? How should the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law be improved?" The masses' questions show that it is not enough to do general publicity in the movement. If we do not promptly understand the masses' thoughts, grasp the key issues, and specifically explain the policies, the movement will slacken and become silent. The Ren Zhuang working group promptly grasped the development law of the movement and took the following measures to push the movement to a deeper level and achieved results.
    I. Rectify and train the propaganda team to improve the policy level of the propagandists.
    The masses' awareness has been raised, the questions they want to solve have become specific and complex, and improving the policy level of the propagandists has become the primary issue. Because they are the backbone of the movement, the main force in the propaganda team, they must be good at leading them, helping them, and encouraging them to work actively.
    Ren Zhuang Village organized three main village-level cadres who participated in the intensive training, eight general village cadres and propagandists who participated in the general training, plus twenty activists discovered in the early stage of the movement (including untrained village cadres), into several propaganda groups, and used the method of contracting areas and households to carry out propaganda. Their work was active, but their policy level was limited. When the masses raised specific and complex questions, they could not answer them one by one. Propagandist Liang Suo'gui (branch secretary) said: "I have completely finished what I learned in the seven days of training, there is nothing more to say!" Liang Xing said: "Now the masses don't want me to talk about the Marriage Law, but want me to talk about why the Marriage Law has these provisions." Therefore, the leadership must not be satisfied with intensive training and general training, but must constantly train them, improve them, enrich them, provide them with new propaganda content, and teach them some specific working methods. Otherwise, they will no longer be able to become the backbone in the movement.
    How to continuously improve the propagandists? We should analyze the questions raised by the masses, find out the essence of the questions, and then explain them to the propagandists. For example, why do some free marriages also end in divorce? We should use the propaganda of "marriage should be cautious, don't be rash" to solve it; why should child brides be prohibited even though both parties are poor? We should use the propaganda of "marriage autonomy, protecting the interests of women and the physical and mental health of children" to solve it; what should the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and the relationship between husband and wife be like? We should introduce typical examples of respecting mothers-in-law and loving daughters-in-law, husbands and wives loving and respecting each other, helping each other, and uniting in production.
    II. Carry out mass self-education.
    The level of the masses has been raised, and the method of the teacher lecturing and the students listening can no longer meet the requirements of the masses. The masses are willing to raise questions at any time and place and get them resolved. At this time, we should organize the masses to discuss, rely on the masses' own personal experiences to conduct self-education and mutual enlightenment, so that the masses have a deeper understanding of the new marriage system, and the problems are better resolved. For example, when someone asks what to do if they cannot find a wife with marriage autonomy, everyone said in the discussion: "That depends on whether this person is lazy?" Some said: "When the Marriage Law is implemented, marriage is no longer a business, then it will be easy to find a partner." Some said: "It will be a problem to find a partner with backward thinking, which young people doesn't want to find a partner with progressive thinking and active learning?" These comments answered the question.
    The main form of self-education is small-scale discussion meetings. There are two forms of discussion meetings. One is a mixed meeting with young, middle-aged, and elderly men and women participating together. The advantage of this method is that they can inspire each other and avoid creating doubts. However, due to different requirements, young people sometimes do not speak up because the elderly are present. The other form is to hold separate meetings for young, middle-aged, and elderly men and women. The advantage of this method is that it can solve problems based on the thoughts of various types of people. For example, some middle-aged men and women approve of their sons being in love with others, but cannot understand their daughters being in love with others, thinking it is a shameful thing. Ren Zhuang solved this problem well in a discussion meeting for middle-aged women. For example, Liang Guiying's mother said: "My son found a partner himself, and the two of them are talking and laughing so well! I really understand being in love (marriage autonomy), I am also happy for my daughter to be in love with someone: isn't my son's partner someone else's daughter? What's so bad about it?" Everyone thought that not understanding it was old feudal thinking.
    Focus on holding family meetings so that the masses learn how to lead a new-style family.
    Family harmony, good production, and a good life are the demands of the broad masses. After the old-style family ruled by feudal patriarchs for thousands of years was destroyed, what form should be used to lead the new-style family is an urgent problem to be solved. Because only by managing the family well can we achieve the goals of harmony, unity, and active production. Therefore, it is not enough to regard family meetings merely as a way to resolve existing contradictions. We must clearly recognize that family meetings can not only mediate past contradictions and consolidate the achievements of the movement, but also are an important way to establish a new family with democracy, harmony, and unity in production. Therefore, this kind of meeting should be held with emphasis after the masses have a certain degree of awareness and after making preparations, which has a great role in promoting the movement to a deeper level. The Ren Zhuang working group failed to meet the needs of the masses in this regard in a timely manner. For example, Qi Laoqing spontaneously held a family meeting, resolved family conflicts, and formulated a production plan. Under his influence, Liang Erzhu's mother asked the working group to help hold a family meeting. After the working group solved her family's problems, it played a great role in promoting the deepening of the movement.
    After the Marriage Law implementation movement deepened, the face of Ren Zhuang Village was renewed. The old marriage system has been basically destroyed, the new marriage system has begun to be established, showing a new atmosphere of marriage autonomy and united production. The forced and arranged marriage system of "parents' orders and matchmakers' words" has been regarded as a historically "immoral" system; free and autonomous marriages are increasing day by day. Since Liang Fengyi and Meng Xiulan openly fell in love after the February training of cadres, new things such as Du Xiuhua and Liang Guiying finding their own partners have emerged in the Marriage Law implementation movement. Being in love and autonomous marriage has become a legitimate and aboveboard thing for young people in the village, and is no longer considered "corrupt and shameless". The conditions for them to choose a partner are progressive thinking, active learning, and good at labor. Parents have also begun to abandon the feudal rule of forcing and arranging their children's marriages. Experience has proved that parents are very much looking forward to their children having a happy life. Therefore, as long as the truth is explained, they can accept the new marriage system. Many parents in Ren Zhuang automatically expressed their attitudes when holding discussion meetings: they must let their children find their own partners and no longer arrange marriages for their children and make them suffer. The Marriage Law is no longer a "divorce law" or a "women's law", but a law that the broad masses are happy to implement. The Marriage Law has become the masses' reliance on establishing a new family with democracy, harmony, and united production. For example, Liang Erzhu's family of three used to be constantly angry. During the movement, the mother-in-law took the initiative to ask the working group to help mediate the dispute. Han Lu'lin asked for help in reforming his family. When Qi Laoqing held a family meeting, he first proposed that in the future, they must act in accordance with the Marriage Law.

    任庄村怎样把贯彻婚姻法运动深入一步
    河北省清苑县第七区任庄村开展贯彻婚姻法运动以前，全村没有一对真正自由结婚的。群众对婚姻法有很多误解，如说婚姻法是“离婚法”、“妇女法”，恋爱是“乱搞”，实行婚姻法即是到区“登登记”、“见见面”，男女平等是“男女作一样多的活”；对建立民主和睦团结生产的家庭的认识也十分模糊；对开展贯彻婚姻法运动不摸底，如梁发娘（寡妇）问区干部说：“正月底寡妇都叫改嫁吗？”本身有问题的更表现恐慌害怕。青年男女特别是未婚青年男女非常拥护贯彻婚姻法，他们希望这个运动搞得好，给将来的美满婚姻打下强固的基础。
    该村干部经过训练回村后，向群众全面交代了政策，正确地阐明了运动的性质、方针，消除了群众的顾虑，安定了人心，开始扭转了对婚姻法的不正确看法。
    经过普遍宣传后，群众大体上划清了新旧婚姻制度的界限，觉悟有了一定程度的提高，对新的婚姻制度表示拥护，并要求进一步了解具体问题。如韩禄林说：“禁止纳妾我很赞成，因为那是地主为了自己享乐；可是禁止童养媳我想不通，因为双方都是穷人。童养媳娘家管不起饭，童养出去可以不饿死；男方娶不到老婆，童养大了，可以熬一家子人家，这有什么不好呢？”群众还提出了很多具体问题，主要是：（一）有关政策方面的问题：如“寡妇改嫁是否一定带财产？”“以前的童养媳应怎样办？”“为什么要禁止童养媳？”等。（二）有关建立民主和睦家庭的问题：如“新婚姻制度好，如何实现呢？”“民主家庭怎样建立呢？婆媳关系应当怎样改善呢？”群众提出这些问题，说明在运动中仅做一般性的宣传是不能满足群众要求的，如不及时了解群众思想情况，抓着关键问题，具体交代政策，便会使运动松懈无力，沉寂下去。任庄工作组及时掌握了运动的发展规律，采取了以下措施，把运动推向深入，并获得了成绩。
    一、整训宣传队伍，提高宣传员的政策水平
    群众的觉悟提高了，要求解决的问题具体了，复杂了，提高宣传员的政策水平便成了首要问题。因为他们是运动中的骨干，宣传队伍中的主力，必须善于领导他们，帮助他们，鼓励他们积极工作。
    任庄村参加集训的村级主要干部三人，参加普训的一般村干部、宣传员八人，加上运动初期发现的积极分子二十人（包括未训练的村干部），统一组织了若干宣传小组，采用包片、包户的办法，展开了宣传。他们的工作是积极的，但政策水平却是有限的。当群众提出具体复杂的问题时，他们便不能一一解答。宣传员梁锁贵（支部书记）说：“我受训七天学到的，完全讲完了，再没有可讲的啦！”梁兴说：“现在群众不是要我讲婚姻法，而是要我讲婚姻法的规定是为什么了。”因此领导上绝不能满足于集训和普训，必须不断地训练他们，提高他们，丰富他们，输送给他们新的宣传内容，教给他们一些具体的工作方法。否则他们在运动中便不能再成为骨干。
    怎样不断提高宣传员呢？应根据群众所提出的问题，进行分析，找出问题的本质，然后向宣传员进行讲解。如自由结婚为什么也有离婚的呢？应用“结婚要慎重，不要轻率”的宣传去解决；童养媳双方都是穷人，为什么还要禁止呢？应用“婚姻自主、保护妇女利益及子女身心健康”的宣传去解决；婆媳关系、夫妻关系应是怎样的呢？应介绍尊婆爱媳，夫妻互爱互敬、互相帮助、团结生产等的典型事例。
    二、开展群众性的自我教育
    群众的水平提高了，先生讲学生听的方法不能再满足群众要求。群众愿意随时随地提出疑问，并得到解决。这时，应该组织群众进行讨论，依靠群众自己的切身经验进行自我教育和互相启发，使群众对于新婚姻制度有更深刻的体会，问题解决得更好。如当有人提出婚姻自主娶不上老婆怎么办时，大家在讨论中便说：“那要看这个人是否好吃懒做？”也有的说：“婚姻法贯彻了，婚姻不是买卖的了，那就可以很好地找到对象。”有的说：“思想落后找对象是要成问题的，青年们那个不说要找个思想进步的、学习积极的对象呢。”这样七言八语即答复了问题。
    自我教育的主要形式是小型座谈会。座谈会的开法有两种形式。一种是青、壮、老年男、女共同参加的混合开法。这种开法的好处是可以相互启发，不致产生疑惑。但由于要求不同，有时青年人因老年人在场而不发言。另一种形式是青、壮、老年男、女分别召开。这种方式的好处是可以根据各种类型人的思想解决问题。如有些壮年男女赞成自己的男孩子和别人恋爱，而女孩子和别人恋爱即想不通，以为是可耻的事。任庄在壮年妇女座谈会上解决这个问题是较好的，如梁桂英的母亲说：“我的儿子自己搞了对象，俩口子说说笑笑的可好啦！我对搞对象（婚姻自主）真想通了，我的闺女跟人家搞对象我也乐意：儿子的对象还不是人家的闺女吗？有什么不好看的呢？”大家认为想不通是老封建。
    重点召开家庭会议，使群众学会领导新式家庭的方法
    家庭和睦，搞好生产，过好光景，是广大群众的要求。几千年来以封建家长统治的旧式家庭被摧毁后，用什么形式来领导新式家庭，是迫切需要解决的问题。因为只有把家庭管理好，才能达到和睦团结积极生产的目的。因此把家庭会仅仅当成解决现有矛盾的方法是不够的，必须明确认识到，家庭会议不但可以调解过去的矛盾，而且可以巩固运动的成果，也是树立民主和睦、团结生产新家庭的重要方法。因此，这种会议应在群众有了一定觉悟之后，作好准备工作，有重点地召开，对推动运动深入一步有着很大作用。任庄工作组在这方面未能及时满足群众要求。如郄老庆自发地召开了家庭会议，解决了家庭矛盾，制订了生产计划。在他影响下，梁二柱的母亲找工作组要求帮助开家庭会。工作组解决了她家的问题以后，对推动运动深入起了很大作用。
    贯彻婚姻法运动深入后，任庄村面貌为之一新。旧的婚姻制度基本摧毁，新的婚姻制度开始树立，呈现了婚姻自主，团结生产的新气象。“父母之命，媒灼之言”强迫包办的婚姻制度，已被认为是历史上的“缺德”制度了；自由自主的婚姻日益增多。自二月集训干部开始梁凤仪和孟秀兰公开恋爱以来，在贯彻婚姻法运动中又出现了杜秀华、梁桂英等自找对象的新事情。恋爱和自主结婚在该村已成了青年们正大光明的事，不再被认为是“腐化无耻”了。他们选择对象的条件是思想进步，学习积极，劳动好。做父母的也开始放弃强迫包办儿女婚姻的封建统治。经验证明：做父母的是十分盼望儿女过幸福生活的，因此，只要把道理讲通，他们是可以接受新婚姻制度的。任庄在开座谈会时很多做父母的自动表示态度：一定叫儿女自己搞对象，不再给孩子包办婚姻，让他们吃苦。婚姻法不再是“离婚法”、“妇女法”，而是广大人民乐意执行的了。婚姻法已成了群众建立民主和睦、团结生产新家庭的依靠。如梁二柱过去一家三口不断生气，运动中婆婆主动要求工作组帮助调解纠纷。韩禄林要求帮助他改造自己的家庭。郄老庆在开家庭会时，首先提出今后要根据婚姻法办事。
