Rationally Adjust the Cotton-Grain Price Ratio and the Seasonal Price Difference Between Grain and Cloth

The State Council's Financial and Economic Committee's announcement of the 1953 cotton-grain price ratio, and the Ministry of Commerce's adjustments to the seasonal price differences for grain and cotton cloth, are important measures by the state to fully utilize price policies to promote the development of the national economic crops along a healthier path. These measures are completely necessary and correct at present.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the plight of China's cotton farmers was tragic. They suffered cruel exploitation by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In particular, the Kuomintang's traitorous policies, which relied solely on imports of American cotton, severely impacted China's raw cotton production, causing China's annual cotton production to fall from 16.97 million dan in 1936 to 7.74 million dan in 1948, thereby forcing China's cotton textile industry to become even more dependent on imperialism.

In 1949, China's total cotton production was approximately 8.8 million dan, far from sufficient to supply the needs of the national cotton textile industry. However, in the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, thanks to the active patriotic production increase movement launched by cotton farmers across the country, the appeals and guidance of local Party and government organs and agricultural departments, the loan support from banks, and the contract work carried out by cooperatives, we have successfully solved the problem of raw cotton supply for China's current cotton textile industry. In 1952, national cotton production was able to guarantee the needs of China's current cotton textile industry and civilian cotton wadding, with a total output exceeding 25 million dan. This is an important victory for the Chinese people on the economic front.

Correct price policies, coupled with necessary and feasible political and economic work such as advocating patriotic cotton planting and loans and promoting combined contracts, have enabled cotton production to reach a level that can meet the current needs of the state and the people. In 1951, the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee announced a cotton-grain price ratio that was extremely favorable to the development of cotton production, namely one jin of cotton was equal to eight jin of wheat in wheat-growing areas, one jin of cotton was equal to eight and a half jin of millet in millet-growing areas, and one jin of cotton was equal to eight and a half jin of rice in rice-growing areas. This price policy greatly encouraged cotton farmers to rapidly expand the planting area of cotton fields and increase the yield per unit area, enabling China's raw cotton production to increase rapidly. There is no doubt that this cotton-grain price ratio policy was completely correct and necessary at the time of cotton supply shortage. However, under the new conditions where national cotton production is now able to guarantee the needs of the current cotton textile industry and civilian cotton wadding, the past cotton-grain price ratio has revealed its shortcomings: first, the cotton-grain price difference is not entirely reasonable, and the price of cotton is too high. If it is not changed in time, cotton fields will blindly expand, and cotton production will greatly exceed the needs of the current cotton textile industry and civilian cotton wadding; second, there is no reasonable seasonal price difference, which has already caused and will continue to cause the phenomenon of excessive cotton flooding the market after the autumn harvest, making it impossible for the state and cooperatives to purchase it in a timely manner, which is also very unfavorable to cotton farmers.

Starting from this specific situation, the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee re-stipulated the reasonable cotton-grain price ratio and normal seasonal price differences for 1953. In wheat-growing areas, one jin of cotton is equal to 6.4 to 7.5 jin of wheat; in millet-growing areas, one jin of cotton is equal to 6.62 to 8 jin of millet; in rice-growing areas, one jin of cotton is equal to 6.62 to 8 jin of rice. The purpose of doing so is to ensure that the planting area of cotton fields does not continue to expand, but must not be reduced, and must be stabilized at the level of the 1952 cotton planting area. Through necessary and feasible political and economic work, cotton farmers should be encouraged to actively increase the yield per unit area. Although this cotton-grain price ratio level is slightly lower than that of 1952, it is still higher than the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and is still beneficial to the vast number of cotton farmers. It is estimated that under the new cotton-grain price ratio this year, national cotton production will develop along a relatively healthy path. Party and government organs and economic organs at all levels should explain this new and correct cotton-grain price ratio policy well to cotton farmers, and guide and help them increase the yield per unit area according to local conditions, and strive to complete the great task of cotton production this year.

At the same time, the Ministry of Commerce has rationally adjusted the seasonal price difference between grain and cotton cloth. The price of grain has been increased by 3.99% based on the national average, the price of yarn has been reduced by 2.5% in producing cities, and the price of cloth has been reduced by 2% in producing cities, and an average of 3% to 5% in sales cities and rural areas. Because our country is still a country dominated by small-scale peasant economy, there are still huge seasonal production and seasonal consumption situations for various agricultural products and many industrial products. Starting from this actual situation of the national economy, maintaining reasonable seasonal price differences is necessary, which is also beneficial to developing production and invigorating the urban and rural economy.

Our correct seasonal price difference is definitely different from the "seasonal price difference" of old China. In the past, during the season when new grains were on the market, imperialists, bureaucratic capital, feudal landlords, and some usurers used the difficulties of farmers who were eager to sell new grains to pay rent and debts to lower prices for purchasing and plunder farmers, causing the situation of low grain prices hurting farmers; when the green and yellow did not connect, they used the difficulties of farmers lacking food to frantically raise prices, cruelly exploit farmers, and seriously threaten the lives of urban residents. The so-called "seasonal price difference" at that time was as high as 30% to 50%. This kind of extra-economic exploitation is absolutely not allowed in the people's China, and has been strictly restricted. Our seasonal price difference is based on the fact that agricultural products have more moisture when they first enter the market, and gradually dry out afterwards; in the storage of agricultural products, it is necessary to spend some necessary losses and storage costs; and farmers and merchants who operate agricultural products also need to pay a certain amount of capital interest in storage. Therefore, when agricultural products enter the market, the price should be slightly lower, and then gradually increase appropriately to compensate for the above losses and expenses. This measure is completely necessary and reasonable.

In our country, the correct price policy should take into account the interests of producers, transporters, and consumers, and should guide commodity production to develop in a more planned direction. Therefore, this time, the regulation of the cotton-grain price ratio and the adjustment of the seasonal price difference between grain and cotton cloth are in line with the central government's policy of developing production and prospering the economy, and are correct measures that are conducive to guiding China's industrial and agricultural production and the market to develop more normally and healthily. All economic workers, especially commercial workers, should summarize the experience of the changes in the cotton-grain price ratio and the regulations on seasonal price differences of various commodities over the past three years, so as to better grasp and implement the correct price policy.

### 合理地调整棉粮比价和粮布季节差价

    合理地调整棉粮比价和粮布季节差价
    政务院财政经济委员会公布的一九五三年的棉粮比价，以及中央商业部关于粮食、纱布季节差价的调整，是国家充分运用价格政策、促使国家经济作物的生产沿着比较健康的道路前进的重要措施。这些措施在目前是完全必要和正确的。
    在国民党反动统治时期，我国棉农的遭遇是悲惨的，他们受尽帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的残酷剥削，特别由于国民党的卖国政策，一味依赖美棉进口，沉重地打击了我国原棉生产，使我国棉花年产量由一九三六年的一千六百九十七万担下降到一九四八年的七百七十四万担，从而迫使我国的棉纺织业更加依赖帝国主义。
    一九四九年我国棉花总产量约在八百八十万担左右，远不足以供应全国棉纺织业的需要。但在中华人民共和国成立以后的三年来，由于全国棉农积极展开爱国增产运动，由于各地党政机关和农业部门的号召和指导，由于银行的贷款扶植和合作社开展的结合合同工作，特别是由于国家制定了对于发展棉花生产极为有利的棉粮比价政策，我们已经胜利地解决了我国目前棉纺织业的原棉供应问题。一九五二年全国的棉花生产，已能保证我国目前棉纺织业和民用絮棉的需要，总产量已经超过二千五百万担。这是我国人民在经济战线上一个重要的胜利。
    正确的价格政策加上必要和可行的政治经济工作如号召爱国种棉及贷款和推广结合合同等，就使得棉花生产达到能够满足目前国家和人民需要的水平。一九五一年政务院财政经济委员会公布了对于发展棉花生产极为有利的棉粮比价，即在小麦区一斤棉花等于八斤小麦，在小米区一斤棉花等于八斤半小米，在大米区一斤棉花等于八斤半大米。这种价格政策，曾大大地鼓励了棉农迅速扩大棉田种植面积，提高单位面积产量，使我国原棉迅速增产。毫无疑问，这一棉粮比价政策在当时棉花供应不足的情况下曾是完全正确和必要的；但在现时全国棉花生产已能保证目前棉纺织业和民用絮棉需要的新条件下，过去的棉粮比价就显出了它的缺点：一是棉粮差价不尽合理，棉价偏高，如果不及时加以改变，棉田就将盲目扩大，棉产量将会大大超过目前棉纺织业和民用絮棉的需要；二是没有合理的季节差价，它已经并将继续造成秋收后棉花过多地涌入市场的现象，使国家和合作社来不及及时进行收购，这样对于棉农也是很不利的。
    从这一具体情况出发，政务院财政经济委员会重新规定了一九五三年棉粮的合理比价及正常的季节差价。在小麦区，一斤棉花等于六斤四两至七斤半小麦，在小米区，一斤棉花等于六斤十二两至八斤小米，在大米区，一斤棉花等于六斤十二两至八斤大米。这样做的目的在于保证棉田种植面积不继续扩大，但亦决不可降低，而必须稳定在一九五二年植棉面积的水平上，经过必要和可行的政治和经济工作，奖励棉农积极提高单位面积产量。这个棉粮比价水平，虽略低于一九五二年，但仍高于抗日战争以前的水平，对于广大棉农仍然是有利的。估计在今年新的棉粮比价下，全国棉花生产将沿着比较健康的道路向前发展。各地党政机关和经济机关应向棉农很好地解释这一新的正确的棉粮比价政策，并根据各地具体情况领导和帮助他们提高单位面积产量，为完成今年棉花生产的伟大任务而奋斗。
    和这同时，中央商业部合理地调整了粮食与纱布的季节差价。粮价按照全国平均水平提高百分之三点九九，纱价在产地城市下调百分之二点五，布价在产地城市下调百分之二，在销地城市及乡村平均下调百分之三至五。由于我国目前还是小农经济占优势的国家，各种农产品和不少工业品还存在着极大的季节性生产和季节性消费的情况。从国家经济的这一实际情况出发，保持合理的季节差价是必要的，这对于发展生产、活跃城乡经济也是有利的。
    我们的正确的季节差价决不同于旧中国的“季节差价”。过去，当新谷登场季节，帝国主义、官僚资本、封建地主以及一些高利贷者即利用农民急于出售新粮以交租还债的困难情况，杀价收购，掠夺农民，造成谷贱伤农的情况；等到青黄不接时期，又利用农民缺乏粮食的困难情况，疯狂抬价，残酷地剥削农民，并严重地威胁城市居民的生活。当时的所谓“季节差价”曾高达百分之三十至五十。这种超经济的剥削在人民的中国是决不能允许的，而且已经受到了严格的限制。我们的季节差价，是根据农产品初登场时水份较多，以后逐渐干燥；农产品保管中，需要支出一些必要的损耗和保管费用；以及农民和经营农产品的商人，在储存中还需要支付一定数量的资金利息。因此在农产品登场时，价格就应当稍低一些，以后适当地逐渐提高，以补偿以上的损耗和费用。这种措施是完全必要和合理的。
    在我们的国家中，正确的价格政策，应当照顾到生产者、贩运者和消费者三个方面的利益，应当指导商品生产向比较有计划的方向发展。因此，这次规定棉粮比价和调整粮食纱布季节差价，是符合于中央发展生产、繁荣经济的政策，是有利于引导我国工农业生产与市场更正常地更健康地发展的正确措施。一切经济工作人员特别是商业工作人员应当总结三年来棉粮比价的变化和规定各种商品季节差价的经验，以便更好地掌握和贯彻正确的价格政策。
