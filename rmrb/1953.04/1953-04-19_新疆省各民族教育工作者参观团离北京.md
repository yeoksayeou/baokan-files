Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: The Xinjiang Province Ethnic Education Workers Delegation concluded its visit to Beijing on the 15th and departed for Harbin on the 16th.

The delegation focused on secondary and primary education during their visit to Beijing. They divided into two groups, secondary education and primary education, and visited Beijing Normal University Affiliated Girls' High School, Beijing Normal University Second Affiliated Primary School, Beijing Normal School, June 1st Kindergarten, and other schools. They also held discussions with the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, the National Committee of the Educational Workers Union of China, the Beijing Education Bureau, and principals and teaching directors of middle and primary schools in Beijing. During the visits, they went into classrooms to observe lessons and directly participated in students' extracurricular activities. In some schools, they spent two whole days observing and studying carefully from class time to after-school activities, and held meetings to discuss the day's experiences in the evening. The delegates unanimously reflected that they had gained rich insights in strengthening teaching planning, combining theory with practice, learning from advanced Soviet teaching experiences, and cultivating children's conscious discipline and patriotic education.

During their visits to Beijing universities, they witnessed the great development of higher education in the motherland, and the percentage of worker and peasant children entering schools was increasing. They were particularly excited to see students from fraternal ethnic groups in the border areas. Delegation leader Anwar Khan Baba said with great emotion: "This is something that has never happened in Xinjiang's history!"

The 58 members of the delegation were education workers from ten special districts in Xinjiang Province, representing eleven fraternal ethnic groups. The vast majority of them had never been to the interior before. Therefore, from the moment they arrived in the capital, each of them was extremely excited, paying attention to everything in Beijing. They spent a total of twenty-four days in Beijing, visiting factories and the essence of the motherland's historical and cultural relics, and touring Beijing's famous scenic spots and historical sites, in addition to visiting universities, middle schools, and primary schools.

When the delegation left Beijing, delegation leader Anwar Khan Baba said to those who saw them off: During these days in Beijing, whether they were visiting schools, government offices, or factories, they were warmly welcomed and cared for by Han compatriots. They deeply felt the warmth of the big family of the Chinese nation.

    新疆省各民族教育工作者参观团离北京
    【新华社十八日讯】新疆省各民族教育工作者参观团在北京的参观工作在十五日结束，十六日已离北京赴哈尔滨参观。
    参观团在北京的参观重点是中学教育与初等教育。他们分成中学教育与初等教育两大组，分别深入参观北京师范大学附属女子中学、北京师范大学第二附属小学、北京师范学校、六一幼儿园等，并分别与中央人民政府教育部、中国教育工会全国委员会、北京市教育局、北京市中、小学校校长、教导主任举行座谈会。在参观中，他们都深入到课堂听课，并直接参与同学们的课外活动。他们在有些学校里，都花了整整两天的时间，从课内到课外，仔仔细细地观察、研究，晚上回到住所大家还开会讨论这一天参观的心得。团员们一致反映，他们在加强教学计划性方面，在理论结合实际方面，在如何学习苏联先进教学经验方面，在对儿童自觉纪律的培养和爱国主义教育等方面，都得到很丰富的收获。
    他们在参观北京高等学校时，亲眼看到祖国高等教育有很大的发展，工农子弟入学的百分比在增大，特别是看到了有边疆兄弟民族的子弟，他们感到莫大的兴奋。安瓦尔汗巴巴团长很感动地说：“这也是新疆历史上从来没有的事！”
    参观团的五十八个成员，是来自新疆省的十个专区，包括十一个兄弟民族的教育工作者。他们绝大多数人过去都没有到过内地。因此，他们自到达首都的那一刻起，每一个人都怀着极兴奋的心情，注意着北京的每一事物。他们在北京共参观了二十四天，除了参观大、中、小学校外，还参观了工厂，参观了祖国历史文物的精华，游览了北京的名胜古迹。
    参观团在离开北京时，团长安瓦尔汗巴巴向送行者表示：他们在北京的这些日子里，不管是在学校、在机关或在工厂参观，都受到汉族同胞们热情的欢迎和关怀，他们深切地感受到中华民族大家庭的温暖。
