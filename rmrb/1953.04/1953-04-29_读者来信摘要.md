Fengjie County Cooperative Forced Fertilizer Sales, Cotton Farmers Over-Fertilized and Suffered Production Losses

Xu Xing, Propaganda Department of the CPC Fengjie County Committee in Sichuan, writes: Fengjie County is a cotton-producing area. Last year, the People's Government, in order to support cotton farmers' production, transported 500,000 jin of chemical fertilizer (ammonium sulfate) and entrusted the County Cooperative Federation to loan it to cotton farmers who lacked fertilizer. Because the leading cadres of the County Federation simply emphasized tasks and did not explain the policies and working methods to the cadres, they turned a blind eye to the forced sales that occurred in the process of loaning out the fertilizer. As a result, forced fertilizer allocation became widespread throughout the county, causing great losses to the masses' production and the government's prestige.

The methods of allocating fertilizer were varied. Some fertilizer promotion teams used long meetings to promote sales; the meetings would not end until the masses agreed to borrow fertilizer. Some threatened farmers with the withdrawal of all other loans if they did not borrow fertilizer. The most straightforward method was to hand the fertilizer over to village cadres and force them to allocate it downwards. Many villages, regardless of whether they grew cotton or not, and regardless of whether the cotton fields were barren or fertile, allocated the fertilizer according to the total acreage or population of the village.

As a result, many cotton farmers over-fertilized their cotton fields, resulting in significant production losses. For example, Liu Dai'en, a farmer in Wanhua Village, used 180 jin of chemical fertilizer on his three mu of cotton fields. The fertilizer was excessive, and the harvest was poor. After paying back the loan, there was not enough grain left for food. The situation where the cotton harvested was not enough to repay the fertilizer loan was common throughout the county. This has created many difficulties for the People's Government in leading production work in the future.

Mao Lu Farm in Jiangsu Should Immediately Correct Actions Seriously Damaging the Interests of the Masses

Luo Binwen of the Mao Lu District People's Government in Jintan County, Jiangsu Province, writes: In 1951 and 1952, the Mao Lu Farm mobilized farmers from nearby villages to plant hundreds of thousands of pine saplings on the mountains, which were provided by the farm. Now that the pine trees have grown to be one and a half feet tall, the farm plans to plant tea seeds and bamboo instead, so they are pulling out all the pine trees. When planting tea seeds and bamboo, they mistakenly destroyed more than a hundred mu of wheat, broad beans, and other crops that the masses had already planted. They also tied up the branches of more than 130 peach trees that were in bloom, causing the flowers to fall off and reducing the harvest. They also forced some farmers living on the mountains to demolish their houses and move. When one farmer refused to move, they planted tea seeds around the house, including in front of the yard, threatening the farmer by saying:

"You are not allowed to touch a single sapling." This made the whole family cry.

In addition, the farm has opened up a lot of virgin land on the mountains, affecting soil and water conservation efforts. Many mountain depressions and small ponds have been silted up by mud and sand washed down from the mountains, damaging about 700 mu of farmland.

Farmers near Mao Lu Farm urgently request the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government to inspect the farm's work, correct its erroneous actions that harm the interests of the masses, and provide appropriate compensation to the farmers who have suffered losses.

Suggestion to the Central Ministry of Railways to Inspect the Handover Work of the Changli Railway Farm

(I)

Reader Dong Zhicheng writes: On November 20th and December 3rd of last year, the People's Daily published letters from many agricultural workers and farmers, suggesting that the Changli Railway Farm, which belongs to the Tianjin Railway Administration, should be handed over to the leadership of the agricultural departments. This suggestion is completely correct. The Central Ministry of Railways also stated in the People's Daily on January 14th that they
"agree with everyone's suggestion and have decided to hand over the farm to the leadership of the agricultural departments." However, more than three months have passed, and the handover of the Changli Railway Farm has not yet been realized. According to my understanding, this is due to the departmentalism of some cadres of the Tianjin Railway Administration.

The Tianjin Railway Administration has always been unwilling to hand over the farm. Local fruit farmers and some agricultural workers have repeatedly suggested that the farm be handed over to the leadership of the agricultural departments, but the administration has always found excuses to refuse. It was not until the People's Daily continuously published the suggestions of the masses and the Central Ministry of Railways made a decision that the administration reluctantly accepted the idea of handing over the farm. However, during the handover, the administration still tried every means to obstruct it. For example, the comrade in charge of the General Affairs Department initially insisted: "The Changli Railway Farm consists of two parts: a farm and an orchard. Only the orchard should be handed over, not the farm." They also wanted to keep the crop workers. This statement is obviously wrong. He then changed his tune and said: "The Changli Railway Station needs to be expanded and needs the farm's construction site..." This reason is untenable. He then said: "When Qian'an and Lulong mine, an external road may be built in Changli, which will require the farm's land." Even more inappropriate, in order to achieve their departmentalist goals, they even moved the location of the Changli Railway Station on the map provided to their leaders for reference, placing it closer to the farm. In short, they tried every means to avoid handing over or delay handing over more than half of the farm's land, and to withhold essential construction equipment necessary for the farm, such as various livestock sheds, warehouses, workshops, staff dormitories, and livestock resources. Their actions would completely deprive the Changli Railway Farm of its superior conditions, not only completely failing to comply with the suggestions of the masses, but also completely violating the decision of the Central Ministry of Railways.

I suggest that the Central Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Agriculture take effective measures to actively study the handover of the Changli Railway Farm so that this issue can be resolved as soon as possible.

(II)

Li Yuxiu, Wang Futang, and twelve other agricultural workers from the Changli County Fruit Tree Experimental Farm write: On January 14th, the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily published a reply from the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government regarding the transfer of the Changli Railway Farm to the leadership of the agricultural departments. It stated: "We believe that the suggestion to hand over this farm to the leadership of the agricultural departments is reasonable. We have specifically studied this with the Tianjin Railway Administration and the leaders of the Changli Railway Farm. Given that the fruit tree varieties on the farm are among the best in North China, transferring it to the leadership of the agricultural departments will result in a greater promotion of excellent varieties, which is beneficial to the country's large-scale economic construction. Therefore, we agree with everyone's suggestion and have decided to hand over the farm to the leadership of the agricultural departments." We felt extremely pleased with the Ministry of Railways' correct decision to address the Changli Railway Farm issue. However, more than three months have passed since this reply was published, and the Changli Railway Farm has not yet been taken over by the agricultural departments. We do not know the reason and hope that the relevant departments will respond.

Bishan Bookstore Distributor Forced Farmers to Subscribe to Books and Periodicals

Wang Jichuo and Zhou Lijing of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Tongliang County Committee write: The work of distributing books and periodicals in rural areas of Tongliang County, Sichuan Province, is carried out by Lai Chuanli, a distributor sent by the Bishan Branch of Xinhua Bookstore, who organized five private bookstores. More than 60 distributors, most of whom were found by Lai Chuanli through personal connections. They engage in serious forced allocation in the distribution of books and periodicals. From the beginning of October to the end of the year, they distributed a total of 255,712 books and periodicals in the countryside (including 64,680 copies of the 1953 calendar); based on the total number of households in the county, an average of about 2.5 copies were purchased per household.

At the beginning of this work, the Propaganda Department of the CPC Tongliang County Committee emphasized: "The entire process of distributing books and periodicals is a process of educating the masses. We must patiently educate and enlighten the masses, and absolutely must not force or command." However, Lai Chuanli and others adopted an attitude of outwardly complying but inwardly opposing the instructions of the local Party committee. Behind their backs, they put forward the erroneous slogan of "one copy per person" and the so-called "three fast policies" of "fast book distribution, fast footwork, fast money collection," resorting to any means to force the masses to buy books. Under the leadership of Lai Chuanli, they launched a "night raid on Tiger Peak" on November 18th. That night, Lai Chuanli led the distributors from Tongliang City to Tiger Peak Town and summoned the village chiefs and peasant association directors in the middle of the night to allocate books and periodicals. When the village chiefs did not agree to allocate them, they were not allowed to sleep, and it was said, "This is a task assigned by the higher authorities, and it must be completed." A total of 3,264 books were allocated to the 264 households in 20 villages in Pingtan Town. The distribution team in Beiguo Township sold books such as "Alternating Current Electricity" and "Differential Geometry" to the masses, who said, "We don't understand them." Lai Chuanli said, "Don't you want to live in socialism? In socialism, we will use tractors, and we will need these books." After these books were allocated, the distributors immediately forced the village cadres to collect the book payments. Because the village cadres could not collect the money immediately, some used the cooperative's shares and agricultural loans to pay for the books. Village three of Nanguo Township used 198,000 yuan of the cooperative's shares to pay for the books; village four of Pingtan Township even deducted 1,400 yuan per load from the wages that the masses earned for transporting public grain to pay for the books; and many villagers were forced to sell poultry and grain to pay for the book payments. The above actions of Lai Chuanli and others have caused extremely bad effects among the masses. Some people paid for the books but did not want them. Farmers in village ten of Yongjia Township nailed some books to trees, and some threw them into the river. Farmers in village one of Beiguo Township threw all the books into the stove and burned them; many books were discarded everywhere in village four of Pingtan Township.

In order to reverse the adverse effects caused by Lai Chuanli and others among the masses, we believe that the relevant personnel must be dealt with seriously. We suggest that the Bishan Branch of Xinhua Bookstore should immediately cancel the Tongliang book and periodical distribution team and give Lai Chuanli disciplinary action. The Bishan Branch of Xinhua Bookstore has failed to detect such a serious problem for a long time and has wrongly praised and rewarded Lai Chuanli and others. The Propaganda Department of the CPC Tongliang County Committee has also failed to promptly inspect and correct this work and should also conduct a profound self-criticism.

Northeast Post and Telecommunications Bureaus Should Improve the Sorting Method for Mail Sent to the Interior

Liu Zhongxiang of Tianjin Post and Telecommunications Bureau writes: Mail from various post and telecommunications bureaus in Northeast China to the vast areas of the interior is not sorted locally before being directly sealed and sent. Instead, it is forwarded to various places via post offices in Tianjin, Beijing, and other places. According to statistics from the Tianjin Bureau, an average of about 70 kilograms of mail transshipped by the Tianjin Bureau is brought in by only the 12th train, which is about 15,000 pieces, calculating 220 pieces per kilogram. These large batches of mail must be sorted and processed piece by piece by the Tianjin Bureau before they can be sent to their destinations. This turning around wastes a lot of manpower and delays the mail for a lot of time. In particular, large batches of volunteer army mail transferred from the Andong Bureau are not sorted locally before being directly sealed and sent, but are sent to Tianjin or Beijing for transfer to various places using the same method. This prevents these mails from reaching the families of military personnel earlier, which is very wrong. In addition, post offices in Northeast China adopt the method of sending letters in loose bundles. Bundles are affixed with seals and labels, indicating places such as Dezhou, Jinan, and Xuzhou, and then they are sent in loose bundles (not sealed in mailbags) to the postal train to transport them to their destinations. However, since the post offices in Northeast China do not carefully study the mailing routes to the vast areas of the interior, errors in sorting occur frequently. For example, mail sent to Jinan contains mail for Taiyuan, and mail sent to Yantai contains mail for Beijing. Because they are affixed with seals, the train conductors cannot handle them even if they clearly see the errors. According to Tianjin Bureau staff, the Northeast post offices' method of sending mail in this way can only be effectively implemented under two prerequisites: (1) the sorters have a relatively high level of sorting skills; (2) the postal train has complete equipment and sufficient sorting personnel. In reality, the sorting skills of the post offices in Northeast China are not high, and the postal trains are small, with few people and many cars, leaving no time for sorting. As a result, mail that should be directly sealed is not directly sealed, and mail that should be sent to place A is sent to place B, causing many mails to travel back and forth multiple times in the mail and fail to reach the recipients in time. I suggest that the post offices in Northeast China should inspect and correct this phenomenon and improve the method of sorting and sealing mail.

    读者来信摘要
    奉节县合作社强迫推销肥料棉农施肥过多生产反受损失
    中共四川奉节县委宣传部徐行来信：奉节县是个产棉区。去年人民政府为扶助棉农生产，运来了五十万斤化学肥料（硫酸砬），委托县合作社联合社贷销给缺肥棉农。由于县联社领导干部单纯强调任务，没有向干部交代政策和工作方法，而在贷销肥料的过程中发现了强迫命令行为，也听之任之，因此全县普遍发生强迫摊派肥料的现象，使群众生产和政府威信受到巨大损失。
    摊派肥料的方式是多种多样的。有的肥料推销工作队用开长会的办法来推销，群众不贷肥料就不散会；有的用不贷肥料就收回其它一切贷款的办法来威胁农民受贷。而最干脆的一个办法是：把肥料交给村干部，强迫着村干部往下派。很多村就这样，不管种不种棉花，不管棉田是瘦是肥，就把肥料按全村田亩或人口平均派掉了。
    就这样，很多棉农棉田施肥太多，生产大受损失。如浣花村农民刘代恩的三亩棉田用了一百八十斤化学肥料，肥料太多收成反而不好，贷款一缴口粮就没有了。收下的棉花不够还肥料贷款的情况在全县是普遍的。这给今后人民政府领导生产工作造成了很多困难。
    江苏茅麓农场应该立即纠正严重损害群众利益的行为
    江苏省金坛县茅麓区人民政府罗斌文来信：一九五一年和一九五二年间，茅麓农场曾动员附近乡村的农民在山上种植了数十万枝松树，树苗由该场供给。现在松树已长得一尺半高了，农场却又计划要种茶籽和毛竹，就把松树全部拔掉。他们在种植茶籽和毛竹时，曾极端错误地毁掉群众已种的百余亩麦子、蚕豆等作物，并曾把农民的一百三十多棵正在开花的桃树的树枝用绳捆起来，因桃花被捆脱落，势将减少收获。他们又强迫一些住在山上的农户拆房搬家。有一户农民不愿搬，他们就在房子周围连院门口都种上茶籽，威胁这家农民说：
    “不许碰坏一棵树苗。”急得这家农民一家大小直哭。
    此外，该场又在山上开了很多生荒，影响水土保持工作，很多山凹田地、小塘都被山上雨水冲下的泥沙淤没，受到损害的田地约达七百多亩。
    茅麓农场附近农民迫切要求江苏省人民政府检查该场工作，纠正该场这种损害群众利益的错误行为，并给已受到损失的农民以适当补偿。
    建议中央铁道部检查昌黎铁路农场的移交工作
    （一）
    读者董志诚来信：去年十一月二十日和十二月三日，人民日报先后刊登了许多农业工作者和农民群众来信，提出了天津铁路管理局所属昌黎铁路农场应交农业部门领导的建议。这个建议是完全正确的。中央铁道部在一月十四日人民日报上也表示
    “同意大家的建议，决将该农场移交农业部门领导”。但是至今三个多月，昌黎铁路农场的移交尚未实现。据我了解，这是天津铁路管理局某些干部的本位主义思想在作怪。
    天津铁路管理局一直是不愿把农场交出的。当地山区果农和一些农业工作者，在很早就多次提出把农场交给农业部门领导的建议；但该局总是找藉口拒绝。直到人民日报连续登载了群众的建议，中央铁道部作了决定，该局才不得已而接受了移交农场的意见。然而在移交时，该局仍千方百计地来阻挠。如总务处负责同志开始时硬说：“昌黎铁路农场是两个场子：一个是农场，一个是果园。除果园应交出外，农场不交。”他们并要把作物工人留下。这种说法显然是错误的。他又改口说：“昌黎车站要扩大，需要农场的工地……。”这一理由不能成立，他又说：“迁安、卢龙开矿时可能在昌黎修外道，要用农场的土地。”更不应该的是他们为了达到本位主义的目的，竟在供给他们领导同志参阅的图上，把昌黎车站的位置搬了家，划到距农场很近的一边。总之，他们想尽各种方法，要不交或迟交该农场一半以上的土地，并扣留农场必须的主要建筑设备，如各种畜舍、库房、作业室、职工宿舍和畜力物力等。他们这种作法，会使昌黎铁路农场完全失去优越条件，不但完全不符合群众的建议，同时也完全违背了中央铁道部的决定。
    建议中央铁道部和农业部采取有效措施，积极研究昌黎铁路农场的移交问题，使这个问题早日获得解决。
    （二）
    昌黎县果树试验场农业工作者李玉秀、王福堂等十二人来信：一月十四日人民日报读者来信栏发表了中央人民政府铁道部关于把昌黎铁路农场改属农业部门领导的答复信。其中说：“我们认为将这一农场交给农业部门领导的建议是合理的。我们专门和天津铁路管理局以及昌黎铁路农场领导人作了研究。鉴于该农场果木品种在华北为有数之品种，改归农业部门领导以后，可收更大地推广优良品种之效，这对于国家大规模经济建设，是有利的。因此我们同意大家的建议，决将该农场移交农业部门领导。”铁道部对处理昌黎铁路农场问题的正确决定，使我们感到无限的愉快。但是这个答复发表已三个多月，但昌黎铁路农场尚未由农业部门接管，不知是什么原因，希望有关部门答复。
    壁山书刊发行员向农民强迫摊派书刊
    中共铜梁县委员会宣传部王继绰、周立敬来信：四川省铜梁县农村的书刊发行工作，是由新华书店壁山支店派发行员赖传礼到该县后，组织五家私营书店进行的。发行人员六十多人，大部是由赖传礼通过私人关系找来的。他们在书刊发行工作中存在严重的强迫摊派现象。从去年十月初到年底的三个月内，他们共在农村发行书刊二十五万五千七百一十二册（内有一九五三年历本六万四千六百八十册）；以全县总户数计，平均每户约买二册半。
    在进行这项工作之初，中共铜梁县委员会宣传部曾强调指出：“发行书刊的全部过程，即是教育群众的过程，必须耐心教育启发群众，绝不能强迫命令。”但赖传礼等对当地党委的指示采取阳奉阴违的态度，背地里提出“人手一册”的错误口号，以及“书发的快，脚跑的快，钱收的快”的所谓“三快政策”，不择手段强迫群众购书。在赖传礼的领导下，去年十一月十八日曾发起“夜袭虎峰”，当晚赖传礼带领发行员由铜梁城里赶到虎峰镇，在夜里将村长、农民协会主任喊起来摊派书刊，村长不同意摊派，他们便不准村长睡觉，并说“这是上级交下的任务，非完成不可”。平滩镇二十村共二百六十四户，即被摊派了三千二百六十四册书。发行组在北郭乡将“交流电学”、“微分几何”等书卖给群众，群众说：“看不懂。”赖传礼就说：“你们不愿过社会主义吗？到社会主义用拖拉机就要用这些书。”这些书籍摊派下去之后，发行员就立刻逼着村干部追缴书款。村干部因为马上收不齐款，有的将合作社股金、农贷款等垫付书款。南郭乡三村即动用合作社的股金十九万八千元垫付书款；平滩乡四村甚至将群众担公粮所得的工资每挑扣了一千四百元付了书款；还有不少村的农民被迫着卖家禽、粮食来交书款。赖传礼等以上的行为，在群众中造成极端恶劣的影响。有些群众虽出了钱但不愿要书。永嘉乡十村农民有的把书钉在树上，有的丢在河里，北郭乡一村农民把书都丢在灶里烧了；平滩乡四村到处丢了许多书。
    为挽回赖传礼等在群众中造成的恶劣影响，我们认为必须对有关人员进行严肃的处理。我们建议新华书店壁山支店应将铜梁书刊发行组立即撤消，并给赖传礼以纪律处分。新华书店壁山支店对于这样严重的问题长时间未有发觉，并且错误地对赖传礼等进行表扬和奖励；中共铜梁县委宣传部对此工作未及时检查纠正，也都应该进行深刻检讨。
    东北各地邮电局应改善发往关内邮件的分拣办法
    天津邮电局刘锺祥来信：东北各地邮电局发往关内广大地区的邮件，事先不就地分拣直接封发，却采取由天津、北京等邮局转发各地的办法。据天津局统计，每日仅十二次一趟车带来由天津局经转的邮件平均就在七十公斤左右，一公斤以二百二十件计算，就有一万五千件上下。这些大批邮件经过天津局一件一件分拣加工后才能再发往前途，这样一转再转，不但浪费许多人力，且使邮件延误许多时间，特别是由安东局转来大批志愿军邮件，也不就地分拣直接封发，却采取同样办法发天津或北京转发各地，使这些邮件不能提前到达军属手中，这是非常不对的。另外东北各局对信件都采取散捆发寄办法。捆上贴上封签，写好地方，如德州、济南、徐州等，就散捆（不封入邮袋）交邮车带运前途，但由于东北各地邮局对关内广大地区邮寄路线不细加钻研，所以分拣的差错丛生，如发往济南的邮件中有太原的邮件，发往烟台的邮件中有北京的邮件等。因其贴有封条，押车员明看有错，也无法处理。据天津局职工谈，东北邮局这样发寄邮件办法，必须在两个前提条件下，才能实行有效：（一）分拣人员有相当高的分拣技术。（二）邮车设备完善、配备足够的分拣人员。现在实际是东北各邮局分拣技术不高，而邮车地方窄小，人少车多，无暇分拣，因而该直封的不直封，该邮往甲地的，而邮至乙地，致使不少邮件在邮途中往返多次不能及时到达收件者手中。我建议东北各地邮局应当检查纠正这种现象，改善邮件的分拣封发办法。
