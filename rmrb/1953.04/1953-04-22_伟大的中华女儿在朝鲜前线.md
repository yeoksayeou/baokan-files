    Great Daughters of China on the Korean Front
    Li Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    We are here representing the female comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to participate in the Second National Women's Congress. We are very excited and honored to hear the reports of many leaders and comrades. In particular, Vice Chairman Deng Yingchao's report on the "Basic Summary of the Chinese Women's Movement in the Past Four Years and Future Tasks" summarized the experience of women's work in the past four years in detail and pointed out the direction and tasks of the women's movement in the future. Our female comrades in the Volunteer Army fully support this report.
    Four years have passed between the First National Women's Congress and this Congress. In these four years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our motherland has made great progress in all aspects and has begun large-scale construction. In the peaceful construction of the motherland, the sisters of the motherland have shown positive labor enthusiasm and great creativity. Our female comrades in the Volunteer Army have also inherited the glorious tradition of bravery and diligence of the people of the motherland. They have written a glorious page in the struggle to resist the American aggressors on the Korean front, defend peace, defend the rights of mothers, and defend the happiness of children. Our victorious struggle has been warmly supported and encouraged by the people of the motherland and the sisters of the motherland. Let me first pay tribute to the people of the motherland, pay tribute to the sisters of the motherland, and pay tribute to the families of the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army who are actively producing in the country!
    As everyone knows, there are many female comrades in the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army. For more than two years, they have fought bravely and worked hard on the Korean battlefield with all the comrades of the Volunteer Army, the Korean people, and the Korean sisters, contributing their strength and fulfilling their responsibilities, and have not disappointed the entrustment and hope of the people of the motherland.
    The female comrades in the Volunteer Army are scattered in various arms and services of the Volunteer Army and work in the organs. Two-thirds of them work in the medical department as doctors, nurses, nursing staff, etc. The rest of the female comrades mostly work in the communications and confidential departments as telegraph operators and confidential staff, and in the cultural and educational departments as members of cultural and art troupes and cultural instructors. In addition, there are surveyors, typists, supply workers, and journalists. They completed their tasks nervously and resolutely in different combat posts.
    As everyone knows, the Korean War was very tense and arduous. This environment is a more severe test and exercise for female comrades. Generally speaking, female comrades are physically weaker and have special physiological difficulties. But facts have proved that the female comrades in the Volunteer Army can stand the test. They are worthy of being the great daughters of the new China nurtured by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. In the early days of the Volunteer Army's entry into Korea, we spent the most difficult days in Korea. In the thousands of miles of march from the Yalu River to the Imjin River, our female comrades, together with the combat troops, braved the bombing and strafing of enemy planes and the bombardment of enemy artillery, endured hunger and marched forward bravely. In the cold winter, the north wind rolled with snowflakes, and the temperature was below minus thirty degrees. The female comrades also carried luggage weighing twenty or thirty kilograms, climbed over ice mountains, crossed snow ridges, and waded through icy rivers to follow the troops forward. The snow often covered their knees, their shoes turned into hard ice shells, and the water splashed on their clothes quickly formed small ice flakes. However, our female medical workers started working as soon as they arrived at their destination. They braved the biting cold wind to go up the mountain to chop firewood and warm the wounded; they dug air-raid shelters for the wounded, built wards, and settled the wounded. In the hot summer, they were not afraid of rain and sun, and fought against the fierce flood waves, wading through rivers as deep as their chests and necks to rescue and transport the wounded. Comrades who were menstruating often felt cold and weak after crossing the river. However, in order to rescue their comrades, they still endured their physiological pain and never stopped working. Female members of the cultural and art troupes not only did propaganda and mobilization work during the march, but also often went deep into the front lines through the enemy's artillery blockade to perform plays, sing songs, and dance to represent the leaders of the troops and the people of the motherland to comfort the soldiers. They also carried needles and threads with them to mend clothes for the soldiers and help the cooks make meals; when the battle started, they turned to the hospital to do nursing work. Female telegraph operators stuck to their posts when enemy planes bombed. Sometimes bombs fell nearby, and the stones blasted up flew to their side, but they still calmly copied or sent the telegram. Female confidential staff often worked in small shelters where several people were squeezed together and could not stand up straight. Sometimes they laid a piece of tarpaulin under the flowing rocks and used the satchel as a desk to write. Since the construction of tunnels, female comrades have also carried out various tasks in the tunnels, serving the soldiers on the front line in difficult environments, and working selflessly for the victory of the war. It is these female comrades, together with all the comrades of the Volunteer Army and all the Korean people, who have won the great victory of the Korean War, defended the independence and freedom of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, defended the safety and construction of our great motherland, defended peace in the Far East and the world, and defeated the heinous American imperialist army that invaded Korea!
    The female comrades in our Volunteer Army come from the countryside, factories, schools, and families of the motherland. Some of them are young people in their teens and twenties, and some are mothers with children. However, when the war of aggression launched by the American imperialists seriously threatened the security of our motherland, the daughters of China nurtured by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party resolutely abandoned their personal happiness and joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, entered Korea, and joined the Korean army and people to jointly strike at the American aggressors. Female meritorious person Zhang Weimin came to the forefront of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea two months after giving birth. When someone asked about her child, she always said: "Which mother doesn't love her child? I joined the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea precisely to protect my own child, to defend the happiness of thousands of mothers and children!" The female comrades in the Volunteer Army thus linked their own happiness with the motherland and the happiness of thousands of mothers and children, demonstrating a great spirit of self-sacrifice!
    The female comrades in the Volunteer Army have made great contributions in the arduous and glorious struggle, and many outstanding meritorious persons and model workers have emerged. The names of first-class meritorious persons Liu Xiuzhen and Xie Xiumei, model nurses Jiang Shuhua, Luo Kexian, Yu Xiangui, and model telephone operator Ding Shufen, and their moving deeds, have spread throughout the country. Like them, there are many female comrades who are full of enthusiasm, have a high degree of patriotism, internationalism, revolutionary heroism, and work selflessly. According to statistics from the political organs of the Volunteer Army, nearly a thousand female comrades in the entire army have gloriously won merit. This is the glory of the motherland and the glory of the women of the motherland.
    Wang Ying, a female representative of the Volunteer Army and a second-class meritorious person who attended this Women's Congress, is one of these nearly a thousand female meritorious persons. In the Fifth Battle, she braved the strafing of enemy planes and rushed into the ward to rescue the wounded. The house was full of smoke, and some bullets placed in the ward by the wounded were burned and exploded, and there was a possibility of hitting people at any time. At such a critical moment, this girl, who was only twenty years old at the time, bravely rushed into the burning house and rescued five seriously wounded soldiers by carrying them on her back and hugging them. Then, she and others carried out three seriously wounded soldiers together. When they carried out the last wounded soldier, the house collapsed.
    The moving deeds created by our female medical workers in order to protect and save the lives of the wounded and sick soldiers are endless. Nurse Wang Zhangying shielded the wounded with her body during an enemy air raid. Although she was injured herself, she protected the safety of the wounded. Who would not be deeply moved by hearing such deeds?
    Among the female comrades in the Volunteer Army, not only have many outstanding individuals emerged, but also model units composed of female staff have emerged. In a nursing company of a certain field hospital, 90% of the personnel were female comrades. In more than half a year, these seventy-three female comrades transfused 16,000 cc of blood to the wounded in order to rescue them, saving the lives of twenty-seven wounded soldiers. Many people had been transfused four times in a row and still insisted on working after the transfusion. This nursing company was affectionately called the "Daughters of China Company" by the wounded and sick soldiers.
    In the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the female comrades in the Volunteer Army have generally raised their awareness, and 74% of them have joined the Communist Party of China or the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.
    When I introduce the deeds of the female comrades in the Volunteer Army, I will never forget those female comrades who became ill due to overwork in the struggle, or who became disabled or sacrificed themselves. Zhao Yuhua, the deputy squad leader of the nursing squad of a certain unit, had transfused 400 cc of blood to the wounded and sick soldiers twice before her death. She was unfortunately hit and killed by an enemy plane's bullet last spring while she was working. The Party Committee of a certain field hospital posthumously awarded her the glorious title of "Model Communist Party Member" in order to mourn this outstanding daughter of China. Nurse Wang Zhouqun was injured in the buttocks during an enemy air raid, but she still rushed into the internal medicine ward to organize the wounded to go to the air-raid shelter. When she was about to go to the surgical ward to rescue an old Korean woman, a bomb exploded in front of her, and she unfortunately sacrificed herself. Afterwards, this outstanding member of the Youth League was posthumously awarded the title of first-class meritorious person. These female martyrs who bravely sacrificed themselves in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, like the other martyrs of the Volunteer Army, will be immortal!

    伟大的中华女儿在朝鲜前线
    中国人民志愿军政治部秘书长  李贞
    我们这次代表中国人民志愿军中的女同志回国参加第二次全国妇女代表大会，听到许多首长和同志们的报告，感到十分兴奋和荣幸。尤其邓颖超副主席所作“四年来中国妇女运动的基本总结和今后任务”的报告，详尽地总结了四年来妇女工作的经验，指出了今后妇女运动的方针和任务，我们志愿军的女同志，完全拥护这一报告。
    第一次全国妇女代表大会到这一次大会，已经四年了。在这四年当中，我们祖国在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，各方面都有了飞跃的发展，并且已经开始了大规模的建设。在祖国的和平建设中，祖国的姊妹们表现了积极的劳动热情，伟大的创造力。我们在志愿军中的女同志，也继承了祖国人民勇敢勤劳的光荣传统，在朝鲜前线反抗美国侵略者，保卫和平，保卫母亲的权利，保卫孩子的幸福的斗争中写下了光辉的史页。我们的胜利斗争受到了祖国人民、祖国姊妹们的热烈支援和鼓励。让我在这里首先向祖国人民致敬，向祖国姊妹们致敬，向在国内积极生产的志愿军指挥员战斗员的家属们致敬！
    大家都知道，在英雄的中国人民志愿军里，有着许多女同志。两年多来，她们在朝鲜战场上，和志愿军全体同志一起，和朝鲜人民、朝鲜姊妹们一起勇敢战斗、艰苦工作，贡献了自己的力量，尽到了自己的责任，没有辜负祖国人民的嘱咐和希望。
    志愿军中的女同志，是散布在志愿军各兵种部队和机关里工作。其中有三分之二的人是在医务部门担任医生、护士、护理员等职务。其余的女同志，多数是在通讯机要部门做报务员、机要员，在文教部门做文工团员、文化教员。此外，还有做测绘员的、打字员的、供给工作和新闻工作的。她们在不同的战斗岗位上，紧张地、坚决地完成了自己的任务。
    大家都知道，朝鲜战争是十分紧张和艰苦的。这种环境，对于女同志来说，更是一个严重的考验和锻炼。一般地说来，女同志体力比较弱，有生理上的特殊困难。但是事实证明：志愿军中的女同志是经得起考验的，她们不愧为毛主席和中国共产党教养下的伟大的新中国的好女儿。志愿军入朝作战的初期，我们在朝鲜度过了最艰苦的日子。从鸭绿江到临津江的千里进军中，我们女同志和战斗部队一道，冒着敌人飞机的轰炸扫射，冒着敌人大炮的轰击，忍饥挨饿，奋勇前进。在寒冷的冬天，北风卷着雪花，气温在零下三十多度，女同志也背着二、三十斤重的行李，爬过冰山，翻过雪岭，涉过冰河，跟随部队前进。大雪常常没过她们的膝盖，鞋子变成梆硬的冰壳，河水溅到衣服上很快结成小冰片，但是，我们的女医务工作者一到目的地，就马上开始工作。她们冒着刺骨的冷风上山打柴，给伤员烤火取暖；她们给伤员挖防空洞，建造病房，安顿伤员。在炎热的夏天，她们不怕雨淋日晒，和凶猛的洪水浪涛搏斗，渡过齐胸齐脖深的河水，抢救和转运伤员。正在月经期间的同志，常常是渡过河后就浑身发冷发软，但是，她们为了救护自己的战友，仍是忍住自己生理上的痛苦，从不停止工作。女文工团员们不仅在行军当中做宣传鼓动工作，还经常通过敌人炮火的封锁线，深入到前沿阵地去演戏、唱歌、跳舞，代表部队首长和祖国人民慰问战士们。她们还随身带着针线，替战士们缝补衣服，帮助炊事员作饭；打起仗来，就又转到医院里去作护理工作。女报务员在敌机轰炸的时候坚守工作岗位，有时炸弹落在附近，炸起的石子飞到她们身边，她们仍旧沉着地把电报抄完或发完。女机要员们常常是几个人挤在一个直不起腰来的小隐蔽部里工作，有时就在流着水的岩石下铺块雨布，把挂包当桌案写字。自从有了坑道工事以后，女同志们也就在坑道里进行各种工作，在艰苦的环境中为前线的战士服务，为着争取战争的胜利忘我地工作。就是这些女同志和志愿军全体同志，和全体朝鲜人民在一起，赢得了朝鲜战争的伟大胜利，保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立和自由，保卫了我们伟大祖国的安全和建设，保卫了远东和世界的和平，打败了穷凶极恶的美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的野蛮军队！
    我们志愿军中的女同志，是来自祖国的农村、工厂、学校和家庭的。她们有的是十七、八岁的青年，有的是有了孩子的母亲。但是，当美帝国主义者发动的侵略战争严重地威胁到我们祖国安全的时候，在毛主席和中国共产党教养下的中华女儿们毅然地抛弃了个人的幸福，参加了中国人民志愿军，进入朝鲜，和朝鲜军民一道，共同打击美国侵略者。女功臣张慰民在生了孩子两个月以后，就来到抗美援朝斗争的最前线。有人问起她的孩子来，她总是说：“当母亲的谁不疼爱自己的孩子呢？我参加抗美援朝，正是为了保护我自己的孩子，为了保卫千千万万的母亲和孩子！”志愿军中的女同志们，就是这样把自己的幸福和祖国、和千万个母亲孩子的幸福联系在一起，表现伟大的自我牺牲的精神！
    志愿军中的女同志在艰巨的光荣的斗争中，已经做出了巨大的贡献，并且出现了不少杰出的功臣和模范工作者。一等功臣刘秀珍、解秀梅、模范护士姜淑华、罗克贤、于宪桂、模范电话员丁淑芬的名字和她们的动人事迹，已经传遍了全国。像她们一样，充满着热情，具有高度爱国主义、国际主义、革命英雄主义精神，忘我地工作的女同志还有不少。据志愿军政治机关的统计，全军已有近千名女同志光荣地立了功劳。这是祖国的光荣，也是祖国妇女的光荣。
    出席这次妇女代表大会的志愿军女代表、二等功臣王颖就是这近千名女功臣中的一个。她在五次战役中，曾经冒着敌机的扫射，冲进病房去抢救伤员。房子里满是烟火，伤员放在病房里的一些子弹被烧炸了，随时有打中人的可能。就在这样危急的时候，这个当时才二十岁的姑娘，便勇敢地冲进正在燃烧的房子里，连背带抱一气抢出了五个重伤员；接着又和别人一块抬出了三个重伤员。当她们抬出最后一个伤员时，房子就倒下来了。
    我们的女医务工作者为了保护和挽救伤病员的生命而创造的动人事迹是说不完的。女护士王章英在一次敌机袭击中，用自己的身体掩护了伤员，她自己虽然负了伤，但却保护了伤员的安全。听了这样的事迹，有谁不被深深地感动呢？
    在志愿军的女同志中，不仅出现了许多出色的个人，而且出现了由女工作人员组成的模范单位。某野战医院的一个护养连，百分之九十的人员是女同志。她们七十三个女同志在半年多的时间里，为了救护伤员，曾给伤员输血一万六千西西，挽救了二十七个伤员的生命。许多人曾连续输血四次，在输血后仍坚持工作。这个护养连被伤病员亲切地叫成“中华女儿连”。
    在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中，志愿军中的女同志普遍地提高了自己的觉悟，她们已有百分之七十四的人参加了中国共产党或中国新民主主义青年团。
    当我在介绍志愿军女同志斗争事迹的时候，我永远不会忘记那些在斗争中因工作劳累得了疾病，或者是成了残废或牺牲了的女同志。某部护士班的副班长赵玉花，生前曾两次为伤病员输血四百西西，她在去年春天正在工作的时候，不幸被敌机的子弹击中牺牲。某战地医院党委会为了悼念这位中华优秀女儿，追赠她“模范共产党员”的光荣称号。护士汪周群在敌机轰炸时臀部负了伤，但她仍然冲进内科病房组织伤员们到防空洞去。当她准备到外科病房去抢救一位朝鲜老大娘时，一颗炸弹落在她面前爆炸了，她不幸牺牲。事后，这位优秀的青年团员被追赠为一等功臣。这些在抗美援朝斗争中英勇牺牲的女烈士们和志愿军的其他烈士们一样，将永垂不朽！
