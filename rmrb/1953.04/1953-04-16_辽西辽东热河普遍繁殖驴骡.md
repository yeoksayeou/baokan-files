    Widespread Breeding of Hinny in Western Liaoning, Eastern Liaoning, and Rehe

    In order to prepare sufficient draft animals for the large-scale promotion of horse-drawn farm implements within five years, the three provinces of Western Liaoning, Eastern Liaoning, and Rehe will not only vigorously breed fine horses this year but will also universally breed "hinny."
    These three provinces have fewer horses but many donkeys. The large number of draft animals required for the promotion of horse-drawn farm implements would be insufficient if relying solely on the increase in horses, while donkeys are too weak. Based on the experience of local farmers, the People's Governments of these three provinces are using stallions to mate with female donkeys, which can breed "hinny" that are suitable for horse-drawn farm implements and have strong pulling power. They are now carrying out mating work using scientific breeding methods. This work has received national loans of 12 billion yuan. Currently, 3,000 stallions and the necessary equipment have been purchased, and 85 mating stations have been established in rural areas, with technicians from each station helping farmers' livestock with mating. It is estimated that 160,000 "hinny" will be produced by next spring. (Xinhua News Agency)

    辽西辽东热河普遍繁殖驴骡
    辽西、辽东、热河三省为了给五年内大量推广马拉农具准备足够的耕畜，今年除大力繁殖良马外，还将普遍地繁殖“驴骡”。
    这三省内马匹较少，驴很多。推广马拉农具所需要的大量耕畜，如果仅靠马的增殖就不够用，而驴的力气又太小。该三省人民政府根据当地农民经验，利用种公马交配母驴，可繁殖出适用于马拉农具、挽力很强的“驴骡”，现正用科学的繁殖方法进行配种工作。这项工作得到国家贷款达一百二十亿元，现已购买到三千匹种公马和必需的器材，并在农村设立了八十五处配种站，由各站技术人员帮助农民的牲畜进行配种。预计明年春天，将可产出十六万头“驴骡”。（新华社）
