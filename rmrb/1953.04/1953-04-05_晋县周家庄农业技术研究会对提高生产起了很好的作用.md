Reader's Letters Summary

    Li Xisheng wrote: The farmers of Zhoujiazhuang in Jinxian, Hebei Province, organized an agricultural technology research association, which has played a good role in improving production. Last year, the farmers in this village achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, and there were also high-yield records of 600 catties of cotton per mu, 953 catties of millet per mu, and 999 catties of corn per mu. Since the beginning of spring this year, Cao Tongyi (agricultural labor model), director of the technical research association, has convened all members of the agricultural technology research association to study the technology of grain selection of cotton seeds and the technology of accumulating fertilizer, applying fertilizer, and topdressing. After the research members matured their research, they promoted these technologies in mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, and also taught them in the fields and during leisure time. The farmers felt that it made sense after hearing it, so they did it according to these methods. By March 20, 13,000 catties of cotton seeds had been selected in the village. Many farmers also sent the selected seeds to the research association for grading, and those who did not select well learned the technology and re-selected. When some farmers sent manure to the fields, they also asked the technical research members: what crops should be planted in what fields, and what kind of fertilizer should be applied, and only sent the manure to the fields after they had asked clearly. The farmers in the village all said: The agricultural technology association is really useful.

    晋县周家庄农业技术研究会对提高生产起了很好的作用
    李喜生来信：河北晋县周家庄农民组织了一个农业技术研究会，对提高生产起了很好的作用。去年这个村的农民得到了空前的大丰收，还出现了每亩产六百斤棉花、每亩产九百五十三斤谷子、以及每亩产九百九十九斤玉米的高额增产记录。今年入春以来，技术研究会主任曹同义（农业劳动模范）召集全体农业技术研究会员，研究了粒选棉种技术和积肥、上肥、追肥等技术。研究会员研究成熟后，就把这些技术在互助组和农业生产合作社中进行了推广，同时又在地头会和闲休场合等进行传授。农民听后都感到有道理，就按着这些办法作了。到三月二十日全村已选出了一万三千斤棉种。很多农民还将粒选出的种籽送到研究会评级，选得不好的又学了技术进行复选。有的农民往地里送粪时还问一问技术研究会员：什么地种什么庄稼，该上什么肥，问清后才往地里送粪。村里的农民都说：农业技术会可真顶事。
