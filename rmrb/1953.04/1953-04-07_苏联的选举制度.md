    The Soviet Electoral System
    Chen Yuxiang
    The Electoral Law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and Local People's Congresses at All Levels was promulgated on March 1st. This electoral law was formulated based on the provisions of the Common Program and the actual situation of the people's democratic dictatorship in our country for more than three years, with reference to advanced Soviet experience, and after careful research and discussion. The upcoming general election will prove that the superiority and democratic nature of our electoral system are incomparable to any capitalist country.
    Our electoral system is, of course, not as complete as the current Soviet electoral system, which is determined by our historical conditions and current social situation. The Soviet Union has perfectly implemented universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot elections. There has never been a precedent in world history for such truly free and democratic elections. With the development of our country's politics, economy, and culture, we will also achieve such a complete election system as the Soviet Union in the future. This can be asserted.
    The Great October Socialist Revolution founded the Soviet state and established true socialist democracy. Since the initial establishment of the Soviet regime, every adult working person has been granted the right to vote. Lenin said: "Proletarian democracy is a million times more democratic than any bourgeois democracy; the Soviet regime is millions of times more democratic than the most democratic bourgeois republic." ("The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky") The Soviet elections are the broadest way to attract the masses to participate in state administration. The first Soviet Constitution, adopted on July 10, 1918, at the Fifth All-Russia Congress of Soviets under the guidance of Lenin and Stalin, showed that the Soviet electoral system was fundamentally different from that of bourgeois countries. According to this constitution, all working people aged 18 or older have the right to vote, and restrictions on nationality, religious belief, assets, residence, and other factors are forever abolished. Only to ensure the overall victory of the proletariat over the exploiters was the wealthy peasant class, which still had power and resisted the new regime, excluded from the electorate at that time. But Lenin emphasized that this was a temporary measure.
    The Stalin Constitution promulgated in 1936 abolished all restrictions on elections. Article 134 of the Soviet Constitution stipulates that all Soviets of Workers' Deputies are elected by voters according to the universal, equal, and direct electoral system using secret ballot. Article 135 stipulates that all citizens aged 18 or older, regardless of race or nationality, gender, belief, education level, length of residence, social origin, property status, or past activities, have the right to participate in elections, except for those suffering from mental illness or those deprived of the right to vote by court judgment; all Soviet citizens aged 23 or older can be elected as deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.
    The Stalin Constitution stipulated an equal electoral system. Article 136 of the Constitution: "The election of deputies shall be based on the principle of equality: every citizen shall have one vote; all citizens shall participate in elections equally." This means that no citizen can enjoy any privileges when participating in Soviet elections. Whether they are workers, peasants, intellectuals, men, women, soldiers, or other citizens, regardless of their nationality or race, or what high position they hold in the state, they all participate in elections equally, and each elector has the same one vote, and only one vote.
    According to Article 139 of the Soviet Constitution, the election of deputies is direct. Before the Stalin Constitution, direct elections were limited to cities and villages. The Stalin Constitution stipulated that all Soviets of Workers' Deputies, from the Soviets of Workers' Deputies in villages and cities to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, are directly elected by citizens. Candidates are nominated by electoral districts. The criteria for dividing electoral districts during the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union are: The Soviet of the Union has one deputy elected for every 300,000 residents; the Soviet of Nationalities is elected by Soviet citizens according to the Union Republic, Autonomous Republic, Autonomous Region, and National District, with each Union Republic divided into 25 electoral districts, each Autonomous Republic divided into 11 electoral districts, each Autonomous Region divided into 5 electoral districts, and each National District as one electoral district, with one deputy elected for each electoral district. To facilitate the receipt and calculation of ballots, each city and district under the jurisdiction of each electoral district is further divided into several electoral sub-districts according to a certain population size. Separate sub-districts can be established in villages or units of all levels and ships at sea, etc., where the population is sparse or the distance from the center of the electoral sub-district is too far. How are representative candidates proposed? In capitalist countries, it is monopolized by political parties. In the Soviet Union, everyone has a certain social organization or workers' group. Candidates for deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union are proposed by the central organs of the Communist Party organizations, trade unions, cooperatives, youth organizations, and cultural groups and their republican organs, border organs, provincial organs, county and district organs, and by the general assembly of workers and staff of various enterprise organs, the general assembly of soldiers of all levels of troops, the general assembly of peasants in collective farms, villages, and townships, and the general assembly of workers and staff of state farms. The direct election system of Soviets at all levels allows voters to know who to vote for, strengthens the connection between state power organs at all levels and voters, and greatly helps to improve the work of state power organs at all levels.
    The Stalin Constitution also stipulates that the election of deputies at all levels uses secret ballot to ensure that voters can freely express their will. Special ballot writing rooms are set up in the polling place, or divided into several small rooms with partitions or screens, for voters to write ballots. When voters fill out their ballots, no other voters or bystanders are allowed to be present, and even members of the sub-district election committee are prohibited from entering. In the Soviet electoral system, there is only one exception to this rule, that is, illiterate voters or those who cannot write their own ballots due to disabilities can ask for help in filling out their ballots. In this case, they can choose other voters to enter the room to help them fill out their ballots. The Soviet electoral system also prohibits election propaganda in the polling place, but every candidate and every Soviet citizen is granted the right by the Constitution to conduct agitation and express support for the candidates they nominate without hindrance in meetings, newspapers, and by other means.
    What is particularly worth mentioning is that the Soviet Constitution stipulates the connection between deputies and voters. Voters have the right to request deputies to report on their own work and the work of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies. If a deputy makes a serious mistake or is incompetent, the voters can withdraw him before the expiration of his term by a majority decision. There is no such provision in the constitutions of bourgeois countries. In bourgeois political science, there are different theories regarding the relationship between parliamentary representatives and voters, such as the "mandate theory," the "legal representative theory," and the "state organ theory." Their deceptive argument is that representatives are always more intelligent and have more political experience than the general public they represent. The duty of voters is to choose such figures and not to instruct them on how to govern, so they should not be forced to comply with the opinions of voters. Therefore, in bourgeois countries, the electoral college is only a temporary gathering that dissolves immediately after the voting is over. Rousseau once said: "The people of England are only 'free' when electing members of the House of Commons. As soon as the members are elected, the people immediately become slaves." In his speech to the voters' meeting in the Stalin electoral district of Moscow on December 11, 1937, Stalin gave the electors a special piece of advice, urging them to remember the right to recall representatives in advance, and "to supervise their representatives, to supervise them." Stalin said: "Those who are deputies should know that they are servants of the people, messengers sent by the people to the Supreme Soviet, and they should act in accordance with the line instructed by the people. If the deputy deviates from the right track, the electors have the right to demand a new election and have the right to tell such a deputy who has deviated from the right track to get out."
    In the summary report of the work of the Central Committee delivered at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Malenkov made the following basic summary of the important significance of the Soviet elections: "Of paramount importance for consolidating our country is the unwavering implementation of the principles of socialist democracy that are the foundation of the Stalin Constitution. In the post-war period, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics and Autonomous Republics, and the Soviets of Workers' Deputies have undergone two elections. These elections were held in a great political upsurge, and they once again demonstrated the unity of our people and the people's unlimited trust in our Communist Party and the Soviet government." The Soviets of Local Workers' Deputies, which are being elected recently throughout the Soviet Union, are the most numerous and most mass-based organs of state power in the Soviet Union. In December 1950, approximately 1.5 million deputies were elected to the local Soviets. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, which convened its fourth session on March 15, was elected on March 12, 1950. This session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union elected a total of 1,316 deputies, all of whom are outstanding figures in Soviet socialist society. In terms of composition, workers accounted for 418, peasants accounted for 269, and staff and intellectuals accounted for 629; in terms of gender, women accounted for 280; more than four-fifths of the deputies were Communist Party members, and the rest were non-Party members. On this day of national election celebration, 99.98 percent of the voters participated in the election, which is such a persuasive figure. Communist Party members and non-Party members nominated common candidates, and almost all voters participating in the election voted for these common candidates. Only in a society where socialism has triumphed, where there are no hostile classes domestically, and where the people are morally and politically united, can there be such a consolidated alliance between the Party and non-Party members. No bourgeois country has ever had elections like those in the Soviet Union, with almost everyone participating and the voters being so united. The Soviet elections clearly demonstrate the true unity of the Soviet people, demonstrate the unity of the people, and demonstrate the solidarity of the people around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government.

    苏联的选举制度
    陈玉祥
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法已于三月一日公布了。这个选举法是根据共同纲领的规定和三年多来我国人民民主专政的实际情况，参考了苏联先进经验，经过慎重的研究和讨论而制订的。在行将展开的普选中，事实将证明，我们选举制度的优越性和民主性为任何资本主义国家所不可比拟。
    我们的选举制度比起苏联现在的选举制度来说，当然还不是那样完备的，这是由于我们的历史条件和目前的社会情况所决定。苏联完善地实行了普遍的、平等的、直接的与不记名的选举。世界历史上从来没有过这样真正自由和民主的选举的先例。随着我国政治、经济、文化的发展，我们将来也要实现苏联那样完备的选举，这是可以断言的。
    伟大十月社会主义革命创立了苏维埃国家，树立了真正的社会主义民主政治。自从苏维埃政权最初成立起，就赋予了每一成年的劳动人民以选举权。列宁说道：“无产阶级的民主制比任何资产阶级民主制都要更民主一百万倍；苏维埃政权比最民主的资产阶级共和国都要更民主几百万倍。”（“无产阶级革命与叛徒考茨基”）苏维埃的选举，是吸引广大群众参加国家行政的最广泛的方式，在列宁和斯大林指导下于一九一八年七月十日第五次全俄苏维埃大会上通过的第一次苏维埃宪法中，就表明了苏维埃的选举制度，与资产阶级国家的选举制度根本不同。按照这一宪法，凡劳动人民年满十八岁，就有选举权，永远废除了对于民族、宗教信仰、资产、住所及其他的限制。只是为了确保无产阶级对剥削者的全面胜利，曾把当时仍有势力并反抗新政权的富农阶级摈绝在选民之外。但列宁曾强调指出这是暂时的办法。
    一九三六年颁布的斯大林宪法，取消了一切限制选举的规定。苏联宪法第一三四条规定凡劳动者代表苏维埃，均由选民按普遍平等直接选举制，用秘密投票法选举。第一三五条规定：除患精神病及由法庭判决褫夺选举权者外，凡年满十八岁的公民，不分种族及民族，不分性别，不分信仰，不分教育程度，不问居住期限，不问社会出身、财产状况以及过去活动如何，皆有权参加选举；凡年满二十三岁的苏联公民，皆能被选举为苏联最高苏维埃代表。
    斯大林宪法规定了平等的选举制。宪法第一三六条：“代表之选举采平等制：每一公民，均有一票选举权；一切公民，均平等参加选举。”这就是说，任何一个公民，在参加苏维埃选举的时候，不能享有任何特权。不论工人、农民、知识分子、男子、女子、军人和其他的公民，也不论属于何种民族或种族，或在国家中担任怎样的高级职务，都是平等地参加选举，每一选举人同有一票，也只有一票。
    根据苏联宪法第一三九条，代表的选举是直接的。在斯大林宪法以前，直接选举，只限于城市和乡村，斯大林宪法规定了凡一切劳动者代表苏维埃，自乡村及城市劳动者代表苏维埃起，到苏联最高苏维埃止，都由公民直接选举产生。候选人是按选区提出的。苏联最高苏维埃选举时选举区的划分标准是：联盟苏维埃以三十万居民为一选举区，选出代表一名；民族苏维埃由苏联公民按加盟共和国、自治共和国、自治省及民族州选举，每一加盟共和国划分为二十五个选举区，每一自治共和国划分为十一个选举区，每一自治省划分为五个选举区，每一民族州为一个选举区，每一选举区，选出代表一名。为便利接收选举票和计算选举票数起见，每一选举区所属的城市与区又照一定的人口数目划分为若干选举分区，在人口稀少或距离选举分区中心地过远的村落或各级部队及航行中的轮船等可另成立单个分区。怎样来提出代表候选人呢？在资本主义国家，是由政党包办的，在苏联，每个人都有一定的社会组织或劳动者团体，苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人，就是由共产党组织、职工会、合作社、青年团体和文化团体的中央机关及其共和国机关、边疆机关、省机关、县和区机关、以及各企业机关的工人与职员全体大会、各级部队的军人全体大会，集体农庄、村、乡之农民全体大会、国营农场的工人与职员全体大会提出的。各级苏维埃的直接选举制，可以使选民知道应去投谁的票，加强了各级国家政权机关和选民的联系，而且大大有助于各级国家政权机关工作的改善。
    斯大林宪法又规定了各级代表的选举用秘密投票法，借以保证投票人可以自由发挥意志。在选举所内设置有特别的写票室或用间壁、屏风分成若干小室，以供选举人写选举票。当投票人填写选举票的时候，绝对不许其他投票人或旁观者在旁，就是分区选举委员会的委员也禁止入内。苏维埃选举制度中，对这种规则只有一种例外，就是不识字的投票人或是因残缺而不能亲自写票者，在填写选票时可请人帮助，遇有这种情形，他可以自行选择其他投票人入室帮助他填写选举票。苏联的选举制度又规定禁止在选举所内进行选举宣传，但是每一候选人以及每一苏联公民，宪法赋予他们有权在会议上、报纸上以及采用其他方法毫无阻碍地进行鼓动，表示拥护其所提出的候选人。
    特别值得提出的，是苏联宪法规定了代表和选民的联系。选民有权要求代表报告他本人和劳动者代表苏维埃的工作。如果代表犯了重大错误或不称职，选民就可以按多数的决定，在期满前把他撤回。资产阶级国家的宪法中是没有这种规定的。资产阶级的政治学中，对于议会代表与选民的关系有所谓“委任说”“法定代表说”和“国家机关说”等等不同理论。他们欺骗人民的论点是：代表者比他所代表的一般人民总要智慧些，政治经验要丰富些，选民的职务乃在于选择这样的人物而不在于去训导这样的人物如何治政，所以不应强迫他遵从选民的意见。因此，在资产阶级国家中，选举团只不过是暂时的集合，投票终了之后，就即刻解散。卢梭就曾说过：“英国人民只有在选举下院议员时候可以‘自由’，议员一被选出，人民马上就变成奴隶。”斯大林一九三七年十二月十一日在莫斯科城斯大林选区选民大会上的演说中，特别给选举人一个忠告，就是要选举人记着有先期撤回代表的权利，“要监察自己的代表，要监督他们”。斯大林说：“当代表的人应当知道：他是人民的公仆，是人民派往最高苏维埃的使者，他应当遵循人民所训示他的路线来动作。如果代表竟离开正轨，选举人就有权要求实行新选举，就有权叫这种离开正轨的代表滚开。”
    马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上所作的中央委员会工作总结报告中，对于苏联选举的重要意义，有如下的基本总结：“对于巩固我们国家具有最重要意义的，是始终不渝地实行作为斯大林宪法之基础的社会主义民主原则。在战后时期中，苏联最高苏维埃、各加盟共和国与自治共和国最高苏维埃及地方劳动者代表苏维埃，都经过了两次选举。这些选举是在伟大的政治高潮中举行的，它们再度表现了我国人民的团结和人民对于我们共产党及苏维埃政府的无限信任。”最近在苏联全国各地举行选举的地方劳动者代表苏维埃，是苏联最多数的最带群众性的国家政权机关。在一九五○年十二月，曾约有一百五十万名代表被选入地方苏维埃内。三月十五日召开第四次会议的苏联最高苏维埃，是在一九五○年三月十二日选举产生的。这届苏联最高苏维埃，共选出代表一千三百十六人，他们都是苏维埃社会主义社会中杰出的人物。就成份说，工人占四百十八人，农民占二百六十九人，职员和知识分子占六百二十九人；就性别说，妇女占二百八十人；代表中五分之四以上是共产党员，其余的是非党分子。在这一次全民的选举节日，选民有百分之九十九·九八参加了选举，这是多么具有说服力的数字。共产党员和非党分子提出了共同的候选人，参加选举的所有选民，差不多都投这些共同候选人的票。只有在社会主义胜利，国内没有敌对的阶级，同时人民已经在道德上政治上团结一致的社会里，才可能有这种巩固的党与非党的联盟，在任何一个资产阶级国家，从来没有过像苏联这样的差不多人人都参加选举，而且选民这样的齐心一致。苏维埃的选举明显地表现出苏维埃人民真正的统一，表现出人民的同心一致，表现出人民环绕着苏联共产党和苏联政府的团结性。
