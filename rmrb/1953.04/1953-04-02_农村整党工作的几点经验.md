Several Experiences in Rural Party Consolidation Work

The national winter rural party consolidation work has concluded before the spring plowing, having rectified 75,000 branches and involved more than 1.2 million party members. Because the policy of conducting rural party consolidation work with preparation, planning, and leadership, as stipulated by the First National Organizational Work Conference of the Communist Party of China, was resolutely implemented, and the education work and organizational handling work were well done, the problems of the rectified branches have generally been addressed, the consciousness of party members has been universally improved, and rural work has been greatly improved, especially the mutual aid and cooperation movement, which has been further developed and consolidated. This has laid a good foundation for the future patriotic production increase movement.

I. Conduct Rural Party Consolidation Work with Preparation, Planning, and Leadership

Judging from the rural party consolidation situation in various places: the policy of carrying out party consolidation work with preparation, planning, and leadership, as stipulated in the First National Organizational Work Conference of the Communist Party of China, is completely correct.

The most important preparation work for rural party consolidation is the preparation of party consolidation cadres. Without a group of cadres who are loyal to the party, have a correct work style, are trained, and understand the central government's policies and specific methods and steps for party consolidation, it is impossible to implement the correct leadership of the party and complete the task of party consolidation. Most areas have conducted serious training and review work for party consolidation cadres before sending them to the rural party grassroots organizations to do party consolidation work. For example, Hebei Province transferred and trained more than 31,000 cadres, and Heilongjiang Province and Shaanxi Province each trained more than 5,000 cadres. There are more than 100,000 such cadres nationwide. At the same time, the provincial, prefectural, and county party committees led some of these cadres to conduct party consolidation pilot work and summarized the experience of this work. This approach, on the one hand, enabled the party consolidation cadres to further understand the spirit of the central government's party consolidation policies; on the other hand, it enabled these cadres to gain rich work experience and understand how to educate party members on how to be a communist party member, so that all party members recognize the standard of being a communist party member and how to improve to this standard; and how to conduct registration, review, and processing work on the basis of full ideological awareness of all party members. In terms of leadership, through party consolidation experiments, rural party consolidation work plans were formulated or revised, making these plans more suitable for the party's objective situation and subjective strength.

However, some areas did not train and review party consolidation cadres according to the standards required by the National Organizational Work Conference, and even pulled a group of non-party cadres to do party consolidation work. For example, in Huailai and other six counties in the Zhangjiakou area, 20 percent of the party consolidation cadres were non-party cadres, especially in Shangdu County, where there were 286 cadres participating in party consolidation work, of which 109 were non-party cadres, accounting for more than 40 percent. In addition, many party consolidation cadres were newly transferred party members from rural areas. These people had a very low political level and were not given sufficient education. Some only participated in a few days of meetings before being sent to do party consolidation work. Of course, they did not understand or fully understand the party consolidation policies and methods. At the same time, they did not conduct party consolidation experiments well, or even if they did conduct experiments, they did not summarize their experiences before fully launching party consolidation work. Because of this, serious shortcomings or errors occurred in the rural party consolidation work in the Zhangjiakou area, which could not meet the requirements and objectives of party consolidation.

Throughout the entire party consolidation process, the leadership consistently adopted the method of closely relying on the activists in the party's grassroots organizations, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and rectifying the organization through the internal strength of the branch. Therefore, the task of the party consolidation work group is to assist the branch in conducting education on the standards of party members, guide all party members to carry out criticism and self-criticism, concentrate efforts to solve major problems, and educate branch committee members and party members to understand and correctly grasp the party consolidation policies. The working steps of the party consolidation work group are generally: after arriving at the village, first convene the branch committee to explain the party consolidation policies and methods, and then convene a party member meeting in the name of the branch committee to mobilize party consolidation. In some areas, the party consolidation cadres also made self-criticisms at the meeting, stating that the county and district committees should bear a large responsibility for many problems in the past branch. This approach enabled the vast number of rural party members to clearly understand the purpose and method of this party consolidation, eliminate concerns, and welcome party consolidation. Then, widely publicize the party consolidation policies and methods to the masses, and ask everyone to assist party members in party consolidation. Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China has gained relatively mature experience in this regard. They first made each party consolidation cadre ideologically clear that this party consolidation is a self-ideological transformation movement of all party members. Only by fully mobilizing all party members to consciously and actively carry out criticism and self-criticism can various shortcomings and errors be exposed and criticized and thoroughly overcome. Secondly, except for individual branch committee members with bad ideology and work style who must be replaced, the original branch committee should generally lead the party consolidation work. Moreover, model cadres in the branch, party member labor models, or other outstanding party members were absorbed to participate in the leadership; through these people, the ideological situation of all party members was understood, ideological mobilization was carried out, criticism and self-criticism was carried out, and the party's policies were implemented. The adoption of this method does not reduce the leadership responsibility of the party consolidation cadres, but increases the leadership responsibility, so that the leadership strength should be concentrated on political leadership and ideological leadership, research and master policies, and discover and solve ideological problems. The vast number of party members expressed their welcome to this, and many party members said: after party consolidation, not only were ideological problems solved, but also work methods were learned.

There is also an opposite approach to the above, that is, not through the internal strength of the branch, but by the work group taking over and replacing it; not enlightening and educating party members to consciously consolidate the party, but relying on external forces and applying pressure to carry out struggles; even mistakenly using bad elements as the backbone of party consolidation, using the disunity between party members and cadres to attack each other, which is called "fighting poison with poison." These erroneous methods cannot solve the problems that should be solved in party consolidation, cannot truly improve the consciousness of party members, cannot achieve the due effect of party consolidation, cannot cultivate the core of the branch leadership, and cannot consolidate the results of party consolidation, and may even cause party members to panic, flee, and commit suicide.

When conducting ideological self-examination, many county and district leading cadres took the lead in self-examination. This leading self-examination is very necessary, because many mistakes of rural party members, especially the selfish self-interest, passive retreat, and coercive command, which are caused by insufficient education, lack of understanding of policies, and unclear methods, are closely related to the bureaucratic work style of leading cadres. After the party members self-examine after the leading cadres self-examine, they will also self-examine their mistakes without any scruples. The party consolidation work group in Tianzhu Village, Tong County, Hebei Province, did a good job in this regard; when criticizing coercive commands, the work group found that some mistakes should be the responsibility of the county and district leading cadres, and took the initiative to conduct self-criticism on behalf of the county and district, but for those that should be the responsibility of the village cadres, they guided the village cadres to conduct self-criticism. For example, regarding the work of digging rivers, the county and district leaders arranged too many work tasks, set too short a deadline, and did not explain the policies and methods well. These were all self-criticized by the work group on behalf of the county and district leaders on the spot. Regarding the village cadres' failure to publicize and educate the masses in their work, and their failure to consult with the masses on matters, and their coercion of the masses to dig rivers, these should all be self-criticized by the village cadres. Especially for the behavior of tying people up and beating people and infringing on human rights, the village cadres should be responsible. After this reasonable self-criticism, the party members were very satisfied and automatically conducted self-examination. Criticism and self-criticism among the vast number of party members quickly unfolded.

Combining with production work is one of the characteristics of this rural party consolidation work. Before party consolidation, various places generally arranged production work. On the other hand, during party consolidation, the mutual aid and cooperation work in the village was also checked. Many places checked and summarized the local mutual aid and cooperation movement, learned from the experience of advanced mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and consolidated and developed mutual aid and cooperation organizations when carrying out communist education. In this way, on the one hand, the formalism phenomenon in the past mutual aid and cooperation was corrected, and on the other hand, the mutual aid and cooperation organizations were developed. However, in individual areas, the party consolidation work groups did not proceed from the masses' level of awareness and personal experience, but only pursued the figures of combining with production, attacked individual farmers, forced the establishment of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, blindly pursued advanced forms, and even made false reports. For example, Ximawo Village, Xianghe, Hebei Province, forcibly organized 99 mutual aid teams, and even pulled landlords and rich peasants into the mutual aid teams, which fundamentally violated the mutual aid and cooperation policies. However, the work group reported to the county that: "After party consolidation, 99 mutual aid teams have been added, and the whole village is enthusiastically engaged in the production movement, turning winter idleness into winter busyness." Another report said that "the 100-household production increase plan calls for applying 6,000 catties of fertilizer per mu." In fact, each mu only has 1,000 catties of fertilizer, and the most is no more than 3,000 catties. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Xianghe County Party Committee have severely criticized this. At the same time, the phenomenon of combining too much work has been discovered. For example, the party consolidation work conference in Tong County, Hebei Province, became a joint meeting for various departments to arrange work tasks. There are: combining party consolidation to rectify and develop the团's organization, develop propagandists, convene people's representative conferences, convene women's representative conferences, reorganize militia organizations, develop members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association... Some areas in the Northeast also require party consolidation cadres to do all the work well during party consolidation. The North China Bureau and the Northeast Bureau have criticized and corrected this. The North China Bureau pointed out that combining too much work will affect the solution of major problems and reduce the effectiveness of party consolidation. This is completely correct.

Finally, it must be specially pointed out that the party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over this rural party consolidation, timely discussed and checked the party consolidation work, and appointed capable cadres to conduct specific leadership, and timely solved problems and exchanged experiences, which prevented and quickly corrected many errors and ensured the implementation of the policies and practices of the National Organizational Work Conference.

II. Conducting Education on the Standards of Party Members is the Key Issue of Party Consolidation

The National Organizational Work Conference pointed out that in this party consolidation, all party members should be seriously educated on how to be a communist party member, so that all party members understand the standard of being a communist party member. Then, according to this standard, review the actual performance of each party member to see if he meets the standard of being a communist party member. If he meets the standard, he is a good party member, and he is required to continue to work hard and constantly improve himself. If he does not meet the standard or does not fully meet the standard, he is required to improve and transform himself. Those with more serious problems are required to correct their problems, and those who are not active or not active enough are required to become active. Those who are not conscious or have wrong views are helped to improve their consciousness and correct their wrong views. In short, our party should educate, transform, and improve these party members with full enthusiasm and sufficient time. The review and processing work is carried out on the basis of the education of party member standards.

When conducting education on the standards of party members, various places have paid attention to the principle of being comprehensive and focused. In the past few years, our party has not conducted education within the rural party grassroots organizations. The problem is that the education that has been carried out is fragmented and unsystematic. It is necessary to conduct a systematic education so that every party member understands the standard of being a communist party member and then strives to be a communist party member who meets the standard. However, there are several common problems among the vast number of rural party members. For example, the awareness of communism is not high, the direction of rural economic development is not clear, and there is a serious coercive command style. These problems need to be focused on and solved. Therefore, when conducting education on the standards of party members, most areas divide the eight articles of the party member standard into three units. The first unit focuses on the first and second articles of the party member standard, focusing on explaining that the ultimate goal of the Communist Party of China is to realize the communist system in China, and that the current development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas is to criticize the rich peasant exploitation ideology and exploitation behavior within the party; the second unit focuses on the third, fourth, and fifth articles, focusing on the fact that the private interests of communist party members should be subordinate to the interests of the people, that is, the interests of the party, and that they should be revolutionary for life, not half-revolutionary, and criticizing the pessimistic ideas of "the revolution has been completed," "retirement," and "changing shifts" of some people; the third unit focuses on the sixth, seventh, and eighth articles, focusing on the issue of serving the people wholeheartedly and criticizing the coercive command style and illegal and undisciplined phenomena. Finally, the eight articles of the party member standard are briefly explained again in connection with each other. In this way, party members can not only fully understand the standard of being a party member, but also focus on solving the main ideological problems of the vast number of party members.

Conducting education on the standards of party members to the vast number of rural party members is not a simple and easy task. If it is explained well, the ideological awareness of party members will be improved; if it is not explained well, there will be deviations and negative effects. The method created by various places of educating through typical figures and typical events is a very good experience. This education method enables party members to understand the standard of being a party member theoretically and have practical standards to follow. Here are two examples to illustrate:

One is the example of the Yushu County Party Consolidation Training Class in Jilin Province, which invited He Fengshan, a farmer representative and labor model who visited the Soviet Union, to report on the situation of the Soviet collective farm. He Fengshan reported that after he went to the Soviet Union, he asked a chairman of a collective farm the following question: "Is there any rich peasant thought here?" A member of this collective farm asked him in return:

"Do your rich peasants in China have tractors, electric lights, running water, cars, buildings, radios, sofas, carpets..." He Fengshan replied, "None of them do." The member said, "We have these things, but the rich peasants don't. Why do we still take the road of the rich peasants?"... He Fengshan made up his mind to take the road of collectivization after his enlightenment. This concrete and vivid report deeply touched people's hearts. He Fengshan's previous thoughts were exactly the thoughts of everyone now. He Fengshan solved the ideological problem, and everyone solved the ideological problem with him. Many party members said: This is the right path.

One is the example of Qi County, Henan Province, using two different typical examples for education when conducting education on the direction of rural economic development. The four party members of Dali Village, Qi County, Henan Province, did not participate in or lead mutual aid organizations, and branch secretary Li Lu also hired long-term workers. The number of households hiring long-term workers in the village has developed to 44, and there are 24 households lending money, but mutual aid and cooperation organizations have not been organized for a long time, and some farmers have begun to become poor and bankrupt. For example, the 15 mu of land and 3 houses that Zhang Zhendong was allocated during the land reform have now all been sold. A total of 67 households in the village have sold 473 mu of land. This report shocked all party members and deeply realized the harm of rich peasant exploitation ideology and exploitation behavior within the party. Then, another typical fact was introduced, that is: six party members and eighteen members of the Communist Youth League in Shawo Village led the whole village to organize ten perennial mutual aid teams and fourteen temporary mutual aid teams, and more than 90% of the labor force and livestock in the whole village were organized. In 1952, they produced 380,000 catties more grain than in 1951, and won the honorary title of model village for production increase in the county. This example greatly encouraged everyone. These two typical examples clearly pointed out to everyone what road should be taken and what road should not be taken. Many party members consciously and excitedly self-examined their own exploitation thoughts or exploitation behaviors and expressed their determination to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation.

When conducting the above education, the following points must also be paid attention to: (1) The examples cited must be selected. The standard for selection is that they can solve the current ideological problems of party members on the one hand, and can explain a certain principle of the party member standard on the other hand; (2) The examples cited should not be too long, and the outstanding parts should be grasped; otherwise, it will form storytelling and weaken the effect of education; (3) As far as possible, examples from this county or this district should be cited. The more familiar the examples are to the party members and the masses, the greater the education effect will be.

However, some areas have adopted the opposite education methods, mainly the dogmatic method. They do not combine with the actual situation of the party and the ideological reality of party members, recite articles, talk about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to communism, from political economics to the five economic forms of new democracy, but the party members cannot understand, and even misunderstand. Or only talk about the beautiful prospects of communism, but not talk about the road to communism - organizing together. Therefore, the party members said: "It is good, but it is impossible to reach." There are also those who adopt the empirical method, only talking about the mutual aid and cooperation movement, but not talking about communism. As a result, the party consolidation training class became a mutual aid and cooperation training class. Or just criticize the coercive command style, but not talk about Article 7 of the party member standard. As a result, when party members conduct ideological self-examination, it is fragmented and cannot be raised to the party member standard. These have been gradually corrected in the process of party consolidation.

III. Seriously and conscientiously do a good job in the review and processing work

Judging from the party consolidation situation in various places, most areas have resolutely cleansed out of the party the counter-revolutionary elements, landlords, rich peasant elements, degenerated elements, and illegal and undisciplined elements who oppress the masses who are mixed in the party. Shandong cleansed out 2,363 bad elements from the 60,360 party members who participated in the first batch of party consolidation. The passive and backward elements were also properly handled. Among the above-mentioned party members, 5,892 voluntarily withdrew from the party or were advised to withdraw from the party. Party members who have made serious mistakes were also given appropriate punishment or criticism and education. Shandong punished 1,846 people in the first batch of party consolidation. Through this serious and conscientious processing, the purpose of purifying the party's organization was achieved.

In this review and processing, various places have limited the problems of review and processing to a certain range. First of all, in accordance with the instructions of the National Organizational Work Conference, the method of resolutely expelling the eight types of bad elements from the party was adopted. However, it was also noted that these bad elements are a very small number in our party's organization, and some party grassroots organizations do not have such bad elements at all. This processing method has achieved a good response inside and outside the party: "This party consolidation has yielded results!" "Chairman Mao's policy has arrived in our village!" "The Communist Party is really selfless!" As a result, the party's organization is more pure, and the relationship between the party and the masses is closer. Secondly, the handling of passive and backward elements. After conducting education on the standards of party members, these passive and backward elements are told that those who are determined to be communist party members can register and be reviewed, and those who are not determined to be party members do not have to register, but the party will still patiently educate and help them. In this way, some passive and backward elements, after education, voluntarily withdrew from the party organization because they believed that they did not meet the conditions for party members. Some, although they did not meet the conditions for party members, did not want to withdraw from the party, and were determined to improve and transform themselves, so they stayed in the party to wait. Party members who have made mistakes are handled differently depending on the situation. Those who have made coercive command mistakes and have made profound self-examinations are generally not punished, but if serious consequences have been caused by coercive commands, they will still be punished as appropriate.

In the review and processing, some places did not follow the above-mentioned scope and principles. For example, excessively pursuing historical old accounts, and even using errors that have been corrected as the basis for punishment. Or treating the issue of improper relationships between men and women as the central content of the review and processing, while abandoning or relaxing the handling of the above-mentioned main problems. These shortcomings have been corrected as soon as they were discovered.

In the review and processing, the policy boundaries were clarified on the one hand, and specific analysis was conducted on the other hand. All places have specifically analyzed the time, place, nature, conditions, and the seriousness of the problems that have been examined; analyzed whether they are ideological and work style problems or political problems, historical problems or practical problems, and whether they have been repeatedly taught without change or are occasional first-time offenders, whether they are masterminds or secondary figures, whether they resist inspection or voluntarily confess, and then processed them according to the party's policy. In this way, it is possible to deal with problems in a realistic and appropriate manner. Songguang District, Yingkou County, Liaodong Province, originally wanted to punish three party members who had made mistakes, but after specific analysis, only one party member needed to be punished. That is, a probationary party member publicly sheltered counter-revolutionary elements during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, attacked the masses' fighting spirit, usually colluded with private merchants to speculate and destroy government decrees, and had other illegal and undisciplined behaviors, so his probationary party member status should be revoked. The other two party members should not be punished. One party member mainly failed to report his father's bullying of the masses when he was the puppet Manchurian village chief during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, but he did not express dissatisfaction after his father was controlled, and he continued to work actively as usual. This self-examination was also very profound, and the boundaries were clarified. After specific analysis, everyone believed that he was mainly because of his low class consciousness at the time, so he was not punished. Another party member had a coercive command style in his work, and he has made a profound self-examination this time. After analysis, everyone believed that he should mainly be educated and not punished. This approach not only correctly handled the problem, but also made the party members realize the correctness of the party's organizational handling policies, and thus felt the party's kindness and warmth.

In the review and processing work in various places, there are also some shortcomings and errors, and the more common ones are: mistakenly thinking that "no pursuit and no coercion" means that even what should be criticized is not criticized, and "organizational handling is lenient" means that even what should be punished is not punished, so that some who should be punished are not punished, and some who should be expelled from the party are still in the party. The Rehe Provincial Party Committee checked and found that among the 30 branches that had been rectified, there were still 12 bad elements who had not been expelled from the party, and 77 incorrigible passive and backward elements had not been advised to withdraw from the party. Other regions also have this phenomenon. The reason for this bias is that some party consolidation cadres cannot fully understand the party's policies and grasp the party's policies. Some people have right-leaning views of appeasement and accommodation towards party members who have made mistakes and bad elements. Some people one-sidedly believe that "the fewer punishments" and "the fewer withdrawals from the party," the better the effect of party consolidation will be. They do not understand that not punishing those who should be given party disciplinary punishment will damage the party's discipline, and keeping those who should be expelled from the party or should withdraw from the party will reduce the quality of the party and affect the party's purity, which is precisely not achieving the purpose of party consolidation. These are all very wrong.

After the end of the winter party consolidation work, various places are conducting work summaries, intensively training party consolidation cadres, and focusing on checking the effect of party consolidation, studying ways to consolidate the results of party consolidation, and preparing for party consolidation work after autumn.

    农村整党工作的几点经验
    全国冬季农村整党工作在春耕以前已经先后结束，共整顿了七万五千个支部，参加的党员有一百二十万余人。因为坚决地执行了中国共产党第一次全国组织工作会议的有准备、有计划、有领导地进行农村整党工作的方针，并作好了教育工作和组织处理工作，所以经过整顿的支部，问题一般都得到处理，党员觉悟普遍的有了提高，农村工作也有了很大的改进，特别是互助合作运动，有了进一步的发展与巩固。这给今后的爱国增产运动打下了良好的基础。
    一、有准备、有计划、有领导地进行农村整党工作
    从各地农村整党情况看：中国共产党第一次全国组织工作会议上所规定的有准备、有计划、有领导地进行整党工作的方针，是完全正确的。
    农村整党的最主要的准备工作，就是整党干部的准备。没有一批对党忠实、作风正派、经过训练、懂得中央关于整党的方针及整党的具体方法和步骤的干部，是不可能贯彻党的正确领导，不能完成整党任务的。多数地区对整党干部都进行了认真的训练和审查工作，然后派到农村党的基层组织中去作整党工作。如河北即抽调和训练了三万一千余名干部，黑龙江省、陕西省也各训练了五千余名干部。全国这样的干部共有十万余名。与此同时各省委、地委、县委又带领其中一部分干部进行了整党试验工作，并总结了这一工作的经验。这种做法，一方面使整党干部进一步地体会了中央的整党方针、政策的精神；另一方面，又使这些干部获得了丰富的工作经验，懂得了怎样对党员进行关于怎样做一个共产党员的教育，使所有党员都认识到做一个共产党员的标准并怎样提高到这一标准；怎样在全体党员具有充分的思想自觉的基础上，进行登记、审查、处理工作。在领导方面，经过整党试验，制订或修改了农村整党工作计划，使这一计划更加适合党的客观情况和主观力量。
    但是有些地区并没有按照全国组织工作会议所要求的标准去训练和审查整党干部，甚至还拉了一批非党干部做整党工作。例如张家口地区怀来等六县的整党干部中就有百分之二十是非党干部，尤其是商都县，全县参加整党工作的干部共有二百八十六名，其中即有一百零九名是非党干部，占百分之四十强。另有许多整党干部是新从农村调来的党员，这些人的政治水平很低，没有给予充分的教育，有的只参加了几天会议，就派去作整党工作，当然对整党方针、政策及作法，不了解或不完全了解。同时又不很好进行整党试验，或者即使进行了试验也不总结经验，就将整党工作全面铺开了。正因为这样，张家口地区的农村整党工作就发生了严重的缺点或错误，不能达到整党的要求与目的。
    在整个整党过程中，领导方面始终如一地采取了紧密地依靠党的基层组织中的积极分子，开展批评和自我批评，通过支部内在力量的方法整顿组织。因此整党工作组的任务就是协助支部进行关于党员标准的教育，引导全体党员开展批评和自我批评，集中力量解决主要问题，并教育支部委员、党员领会和正确掌握整党政策。整党工作组的工作步骤一般是：到村后首先召开支部委员会，交代整党方针政策及作法，然后以支委会名义召集党员大会进行整党动员。有些地区的整党干部并在会上作了自我检查，说明过去支部中的许多问题，区委县委要负很大责任。这种作法，使广大农村党员可以明确认识这次整党的目的和作法，而消除顾虑，欢迎整党。继即广泛地向群众宣传整党方针和作法，要求大家协助党员整党。东北黑龙江省在这方面获得了比较成熟的经验。他们首先使每个整党干部从思想上明确认识这次整党是全体党员的自我思想改造运动，只有充分发动全体党员自觉地积极地开展批评和自我批评，才能揭发和批判各种缺点、错误，并予以彻底克服。其次，除了个别思想作风恶劣的支部委员必须更换外，一般应由原来的支委会领导整党工作。而且吸收了支部中的模范干部、党员劳动模范或其他优秀党员参加领导；通过这些人去了解全体党员的思想情况，进行思想动员，开展批评和自我批评，贯彻党的方针政策。采用这种方法，并不是减轻了整党干部的领导责任，而是加重了领导责任，要把领导力量集中到政治领导、思想领导方面去，研究与掌握政策，发现和解决思想问题。广大党员对此则表示欢迎，许多党员说：经过整党，不光解决了思想问题，还学会了工作方法。
    也有采取与上述相反的一种作法，即不是通过支部内在力量，而由工作组包办代替，不是启发教育党员自觉整党，而是依靠外力，施用压力进行斗争；甚至错误地使用坏分子作为整党骨干，利用党员和干部之间的不团结，相互攻击，名之曰“以毒攻毒”。这些错误作法，就不能解决整党中应该解决的问题，不能真正提高党员觉悟，不能达到整党应有的效果，不能培养起支部领导核心，不能巩固整党成果，甚至还会使党员发生恐慌、逃跑、自杀等现象。
    在进行检查思想时，许多县、区领导干部带头检查。这种带头检查是非常必要的，因为农村党员的许多错误，特别是由于教育不够，政策不懂，方法不明而产生的自私自利、消极后退、强迫命令等毛病，是和领导干部的官僚主义作风紧紧联系着的。而党员在领导干部检查之后，也就会毫无顾虑地检讨自己的错误。河北通县天竺村整党工作组在这方面作得很好；在批判强迫命令时，工作组发现有些错误应由县区领导干部负责的，即主动代表县区进行检讨，但是对于应该由村干部负责的，则引导村干部进行检讨。例如关于挖河等工作，县区领导方面布置工作任务过多，期限过短，又没有很好交代政策和作法。这些均由工作组代表县区领导当场作了检讨。关于村干部在工作中不向群众宣传教育，有事不和群众商量，强迫群众挖河，这些都应由村干部检讨。特别对于捆人打人侵犯人权的行为，更应该由村干部负责。经过这种合情合理的检讨，党员非常满意，自动进行检查，广大党员中的批评和自我批评即迅速展开。
    结合生产工作，是这次农村整党工作的特点之一。各地在整党之前一般的都安排了生产工作，另方面，在整党中，又结合检查了村里的互助合作工作。不少地方在进行共产主义教育时，检查和总结了本地的互助合作运动，学习了先进互助合作组织的经验，整顿和发展了互助合作组织。这样，一方面纠正了过去互助合作中的形式主义现象，另一方面，发展了互助合作组织。但是也有个别地区的整党工作组不是从群众觉悟水平与切身体验出发，只为了追求结合生产的数字，打击单干农民，强迫成立互助合作组织，盲目追求高级形式，甚至作假报告。如河北香河西马窝村即强迫组织了九十九个互助组，并将地主富农分子也拉进互助组内，根本违反了互助合作政策。而这个工作组向县报告中却是：“整党后，增加了九十九个互助组，全村轰轰烈烈地投入生产运动，由冬闲变为冬忙。”另报告“一百户的增产计划每亩施肥六千斤。”实际上每亩只有肥料一千斤，最多的也不过三千斤。河北省委、香河县委对此都提出了严格的批评。同时发现了结合工作过多的现象。例如河北通县的整党工作会议，变成了各部门布置工作任务的联席会议。计有：结合整党整顿和发展团的组织，发展宣传员，召开人民代表会，召开妇女代表会，整理民兵组织，发展中苏友好协会会员……。东北某些地区也要求整党干部在整党中作好一切工作。华北局、东北局对此都进行了批评与纠正。华北局指出结合工作过多，会影响主要问题的解决，降低整党的效果。这是完全正确的。
    最后要特别提出的，是各级党委加强了对这次农村整党的领导，及时地讨论与检查了整党工作，并委派得力干部进行具体领导，及时解决问题和交流经验，这就防止和迅速纠正了许多错误，保证了全国组织工作会议的方针、政策及作法的贯彻。
    二、进行关于党员标准的教育，是整党的关键问题
    全国组织工作会议曾指出在这次整党中，对所有党员，要认真地进行一次怎样做一个共产党员的教育，使所有党员都明白做一个共产党员的标准。然后根据这种标准来审查每一个党员的实际表现，看他是否够做一个共产党员的标准，如果是够标准的，那是好党员，要求他继续努力不断提高自己。如果不够标准或不完全够标准的，则要求他们提高与改造自己。有较严重毛病的，要求他们改正毛病，没有积极性或积极性不够的，则要求他们积极起来。觉悟不高，观点有错误的，则帮助他们提高觉悟，改正错误观点。总之，我们党应该是满腔热忱地并用充分时间去教育、改造、提高这些党员。而审查处理工作则是从党员标准教育的基础上进行的。
    各地在进行党员标准的教育时，都注意了既要全面，又要有重点的原则。几年来，我们党并不是没有在农村党的基层组织内进行过教育，问题只是所进行的教育零碎片断不系统，有必要进行一次系统的教育，使每一个党员都懂得怎样做一个共产党员的标准后，努力争取做一个够标准的共产党员。但是广大农村党员中又普遍存在着几个问题，例如共产主义的觉悟还不高，对农村经济发展方向不明确，存在着严重的强迫命令作风。这些问题均需着重来解决。因此多数地区在进行党员标准教育时，把党员标准八条分为三个单元，第一个单元以党员标准第一、二条为主，着重讲解中国共产党的最终目的，是在中国实现共产主义制度，目前在农村即要发展互助合作运动，批判党内的富农剥削思想和剥削行为；第二个单元以第三、四、五条为主，着重讲共产党员的私人利益应服从人民的即党的利益，要终身革命，不是半截革命，批判某些人的“革命已经完成”“退休”“换班”的消极思想；第三个单元以第六、七、八条为主，着重讲全心全意为人民群众服务的问题，批判强迫命令作风以及违法乱纪现象。最后再简单明了地把党员标准八条联系起来讲解一次。这样，既使党员全面地了解了做一个党员的标准，又有重点地解决了广大党员思想上的主要问题。
    向广大农村党员进行党员标准教育并不是一件简单容易的事情，讲得好，就提高了党员思想觉悟；讲不好，就会发生偏差，起消极作用。各地所创造的通过典型人物，典型事例的活人活事的教育，是一个很好的经验。这种教育方法使党员从理论上认识了作一个党员的标准，又有实际标准可遵循。这里可以举两个例子来说明：
    一个是吉林省榆树县整党训练班，请赴苏联参观的农民代表、劳动模范何凤山报告苏联集体农庄情形的例子。何凤山报告他到苏联后，曾向一位集体农庄主席提出这样的问题：“你们这里有没有富农思想？”这个集体农庄的一位庄员就反问他道：
    “你们中国的富农有没有拖拉机、电灯、自来水、汽车、楼房、收音机、沙发、地毯……”何凤山回答“都没有”。这位庄员就说：“这些东西我们都有，富农没有，为什么还要走富农道路呢？”……何凤山经他这一启发才下定决心走合作化集体化的道路。这个具体生动的报告深深地打动了人心，何凤山以前的思想情况，正是大家现在的思想情况，何凤山解决了思想问题，大家也随着解决了思想问题，许多党员都表示：这可找准了道路了。
    一个是河南省淇县在进行农村经济发展方向教育时，用两个不同典型事例进行教育的例子。河南淇县大李庄的四个党员都没有参加和领导互助组织，支部书记李禄还雇长工。全村雇长工的发展到四十四户，放债的有二十四户，而互助合作组织长时间组织不起来，部分农民开始贫困和破产。如张振东在土地改革时分得的十五亩地，三间房，现已全部卖光。全村共有六十七户，卖出土地四百七十三亩。这个报告使全体党员大吃一惊，深刻地体会到了党内富农剥削思想和剥削行为的危害性。接着又介绍了另一个典型事实，即：沙窝村六个党员和十八个团员，领导全村组织了十个常年互助组、十四个临时互助组，全村百分之九十以上的劳畜力都组织起来了。一九五二年就比一九五一年多打粮食三十八万斤，获得了全县增产模范村的光荣称号。这个例子给大家鼓舞很大。这两个典型事例给大家明确地指出了应走什么道路，不应走什么道路。许多党员自觉地激动地检查了自己的剥削思想或剥削行为，表示决心走互助合作的道路。
    在进行上述教育时，还必须注意以下几点：（一）所举的事例必须经过选择，选择的标准，一方面是能解决党员当前的思想问题的；另一方面是能说明党员标准某一原则的；（二）所举的事例不可过长，要抓住其中的突出部分；否则会形成讲故事，减弱教育的效果；（三）尽可能举本县本区的例子，越是党员群众熟悉的例子，其教育效果越大。
    但是也有些地区采取了相反的教育方法，主要的是教条主义的方法，不结合党的实际和党员的思想实际，背诵条文，从太平天国讲到共产主义，从政治经济学讲到新民主主义五种经济形态，而党员却听不懂，甚至发生误会。或者只讲共产主义的美好远景，而不讲走向共产主义的道路——组织起来，因此党员说：“好是好，就是走不到。”也有采用经验主义的方法，光讲互助合作运动，不讲共产主义。结果把整党训练班变成了互助合作训练班。或者只是批判强迫命令作风，不讲党员标准第七条。结果，党员在进行思想检查时，零零碎碎，提不到党员标准上来。这些都在整党过程中逐渐得到了纠正。
    三、严肃认真地做好审查处理工作
    从各地整党情况来看，多数地区在审查处理工作中，已将混在党内的反革命分子、地主、富农分子、蜕化变质分子、欺压群众的违法乱纪分子等坚决清洗出党。山东即在参加第一批整党的六万零三百六十名党员中，清洗了坏分子二千三百六十三名。对于消极落后分子，也作了妥善处理，在上述党员中，自动退党与劝退出党的有五千八百九十二名。犯有严重错误的党员，也酌情给以处分或批评教育。山东在第一批整党中就处分了一千八百四十六人。经过这种严肃认真的处理，达到了纯洁党的组织的目的。
    在这次审查处理中，各地把审查处理的问题，限制在一定的范围内。首先按照全国组织工作会议的指示，对于八类坏分子，采用了坚决清除出党的办法。但是又注意了这些坏分子，在我们党的组织内是极少数的，有不少党的基层组织内，就根本没有这种坏分子。这种处理方法，取得了党内外的良好反映：“这次整党整出结果来了！”“毛主席的政策到咱村了！”“共产党真是大公无私！”因而党的组织更加纯洁，党与群众的关系更加密切起来。其次对于消极落后分子的处理。进行了关于党员标准的教育后，向这些消极落后分子说明有决心当共产党员的，可以来登记，进行审查，没有决心当党员的，就不必登记，但党仍会耐心地对他们教育帮助。这样，有一部分消极落后分子，经过教育，自认为不够党员条件自动地退出了党的组织，有一部分虽不够党员条件，但不愿退党，有决心提高与改造自己，即留在党内等待。对于犯错误的党员，则根据情况，分别处理。有强迫命令错误，已作了深刻检讨者，一般不给以处分，但如因强迫命令而造成严重恶果者，仍要酌情给以处分。
    在审查处理中，也有些地方未按照上述范围和原则进行。例如过分追算历史上的旧账，甚至把已经改正了的错误也作为处分根据。或者把男女不正确关系问题，当作了审查处理的中心内容，而放弃或放松了上述主要问题的处理。这些缺点，一经查出，均作了纠正。
    在审查处理时，一方面划清了政策界限；另方面进行了具体分析。各地对检查出来的问题都具体分析了时间、地点、性质、条件，是非轻重；分析其是思想作风问题还是政治问题，是历史问题还是现实问题，以及是屡教不改还是偶尔初犯，是主谋分子还是次要分子，是抗拒检查还是自动交代，然后根据党的政策，进行处理。这样就能够作到实事求是地恰如其分地处理问题。辽东营口县宋光区原来对三个有错误的党员都要处分，可是经过具体分析后，却只有一个党员需要处分。即其中有个候补党员，曾在镇压反革命时，公开掩护反革命分子，打击群众斗争情绪，平常和私商投机捣把破坏政府法令，并有其他违法乱纪行为，因此要取消其候补党员资格。另两个党员就不应给以处分，一个党员主要是在镇压反革命时，未检举其父亲在当伪满屯长时对群众的欺压行为，但在其父亲被管制后，没有表示不满，而且照常积极工作。这次检讨又很深刻，划清了界限。经过具体分析，大家认为当时他主要是因为阶级觉悟不高，因此不给以处分。另一个党员在工作中有强迫命令作风，这次已作了深刻的检讨。经过分析，大家认为对他主要是教育，不给以处分。这种作法，不仅正确地处理了问题，并使党员体会了党的组织处理方针政策的正确，从而感到了党的亲切、温暖。
    各地审查处理工作中，也存在若干缺点和错误，而较为普遍的则是：误以为“不追不逼”就是该批评的也不批评了，“组织处理从宽”就是该处分的也不处分了，因而使一些该处分的未受到处分，该开除党籍的也留在党内了。热河省委检查出在已整顿的三十个支部中，尚有十二名坏分子未清除出党，七十七名不可改造的消极落后分子没有劝退出党。其他地区也有这种现象。这种偏向的所以产生，除了由于有些整党干部不能全面地了解党的政策，掌握党的政策外，还由于有些人对犯错误的党员和坏分子存在着姑息迁就的右倾观点，有些人片面地认为“处分的越少”“退党的越少”，整党的效果就越好。他们不了解，对应该给以党的纪律处分的人不给以处分，就破坏了党的纪律，应该开除出党或应该退党的人而仍留在党内，就降低了党的质量和影响了党的纯洁，这恰恰是没有达到整党的目的。这都是十分错误的。
    在冬季整党工作结束以后，各地都在先后进行工作总结，集训整党干部，并有重点地检查整党效果，研究巩固整党成果的办法，准备秋后整党工作。
