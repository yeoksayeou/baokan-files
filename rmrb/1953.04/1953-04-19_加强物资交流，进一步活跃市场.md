Strengthening Material Exchange to Further Activate the Market
Yao Huibin, Deputy Director of the North China Commercial Bureau

Since the implementation of the Central Committee's instructions on adjusting commerce in the North China region, the market has become increasingly active, which is extremely beneficial to the country's economic construction. Now is the season for agricultural production, and basic construction has also begun in various places, both of which require the market to supply a large amount of production and living materials. At the same time, farmers have a backlog of small local products that they want to sell, and handicraftsmen want to sell their products. Urban industrial products also need to be continuously purchased and promoted. However, the off-season has already arrived, and some state-owned commercial units that have implemented economic accounting, after the initial determination of funds, are "only willing to sell goods, not willing to purchase goods" or "more out than in" due to fear of commodity backlog. As a result, many units have reduced the variety of goods, decreased sales, and failed to complete purchase and sales plans on time, causing a shortage of certain commodities in the market. Some units that are conducting economic accounting have not well integrated the establishment of wholesale stations, the determination of funds, and purchase and sales operations, and have relaxed the work of supplying production and living materials to rural areas. The timely supply of grain and industrial equipment and the purchase of certain seasonal commodities have also been done poorly. Many cadres in business departments and administrative departments have not recognized the new favorable situation of the increasing development of industrial and agricultural production, the rapid increase in the purchasing power of urban and rural residents, and the country's entry into a period of large-scale economic construction, and instead hold on to empirical views, emphasizing that "spring is the off-season." Therefore, they do not actively lead and organize spring material exchange work. In addition, some private industrialists and merchants, after the adjustment of commerce, especially in areas where state-owned trade and cooperatives have reduced their organizations, illegal speculative activities have begun to grow, causing chaos in some primary markets. This is very detrimental to the material exchange between urban and rural areas.

In order to correctly implement the Central Committee's instructions on adjusting commerce, support industrial and agricultural production, vigorously promote industrial products, and better serve the country's economic construction, we must strengthen the organization and leadership of spring material exchange work to further activate markets in various places. To this end, we should take the following measures:

I. Vigorously carry out the purchase and sales operations of state-owned commerce and strive to complete the purchase and sales plan for the second quarter. We must criticize and overcome the purely "fear of backlog" mentality that is not responsible to industrial and agricultural production or consumers, the conservative idea of only being willing to sell goods, not willing to purchase goods, or only willing to purchase brand-name goods and not willing to purchase local non-brand-name goods, and give play to the leading role of state-owned commerce in the market. Organize material exchange, and solve the problem of backlog of bulk commodities and the disconnection between production and sales and supply and demand through contract signing and plan balancing. Study the main problems existing in the current market and business operations, and put forward new goals based on specific circumstances to ensure the completion of the purchase and sales plan. Organize exchange meetings between the upper and lower levels and between departments within state-owned companies and cooperatives. Hold forums for consumers or transporters to understand the supply and demand situation. Organize material exchange work through various forms of meetings, and various places should create new, rich forms of material exchange based on specific circumstances.

II. Strengthen and improve the leadership of primary markets and hold good material exchange meetings (focusing on small material exchange meetings in intermediate and primary markets). One of the important links in carrying out spring material exchange is to rectify primary markets, because it is the bridge connecting urban and rural areas. However, at present, varying degrees of chaos still generally exist in primary markets in various places, and some unnecessary management measures and disorganized and undisciplined phenomena of arbitrarily interfering in the market have not been completely corrected. The industrial and commercial administrative departments in various places in North China should educate cadres well on policies, and carefully review price policies, so that everyone recognizes that the purpose of market management is to develop production and activate material exchange. On the one hand, we must resolutely restrict illegal merchants from raising prices, lowering prices, and engaging in speculative manipulation. On the other hand, we must organize and guide material exchange and implement the policy of free domestic trade. We must also conduct an in-depth inspection of the markets within our jurisdiction. According to the seasonal characteristics and the new market situation after the adjustment of commerce, various places in North China must hold good small material exchange meetings. The following methods should be adopted:

(1) Under the unified leadership of the local material exchange committee (counties and towns without such organizations should be mainly led by the local industrial and commercial administrative departments, absorbing state-owned trade, cooperatives, taxation, banks, transportation and other departments, as well as the Federation of Industry and Commerce and representative private merchants to participate in the joint formation), strengthen the organization and leadership of various local temple fairs and mule and horse fairs to make them serve material exchange; and prepare and hold spring material exchange meetings in an organized and leadership manner. Its task is mainly to solve the problem of promoting farmers' surplus small local products and small handicrafts, and the supply of agricultural tools, fertilizers, livestock, building materials, and industrial products. According to the needs of the masses, commodity exhibitions with content can be appropriately carried out, and political propaganda work should be strengthened.

(2) Fully mobilize private merchants, peddlers, and handicraftsmen to participate in transactions to solve the sales problems of farmers' small local products and the supply of agricultural tools. Therefore, on the one hand, we must educate cadres to resolutely implement the policies of the Party and the People's Government and actively organize private merchants to serve the material exchange between urban and rural areas; on the other hand, we must improve market management, prevent the growth of speculative activities by some illegal private merchants, and facilitate material exchange. Illegal private merchants who repeatedly fail to reform after education must be dealt with to establish a new business style.

(3) Small material exchange meetings in primary markets should mainly be based on cash and spot goods. Local state-owned trade should resolutely implement the policy of wholesale as the main business to support cooperatives and lead the market.

(4) Small material exchange meetings must fully adapt to local production and sales conditions and the needs of the masses. Hold meetings when needed, and do not hold meetings when not needed. Solve whatever problems the masses have, and solve as many problems as possible. We oppose the use of rigid administrative orders and blind calls, the pursuit of numbers, and the ideas and practices of extravagance and waste without regard to the actual situation.

III. Seriously supervise the implementation of contracts and agreements to promote material exchange.

The North China Material Exchange Conference and the material exchange meetings held in various places in 1952 totaled more than 11 trillion yuan, of which contracts and agreements accounted for a large proportion, and a large part of them are futures contracts that will be executed this year. Therefore, urging the full implementation of the above contracts is an important organizational work to strengthen spring material exchange. It is recommended that the financial committees in various places in North China start to check the implementation of contracts and agreements between local state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and private industrialists and merchants, so that the departments executing the contracts recognize the seriousness and legality of the contracts, earnestly implement them, and are not allowed to easily revoke them. If, due to special circumstances, it is indeed impossible to implement them, the consent of the other party must be obtained and approved by the higher-level financial committee before they can be modified or terminated. The results of the inspections in various places should also be reported to the North China Contract and Agreement Implementation Inspection Committee.

IV. Correctly implement the Central Committee's instructions on adjusting commerce, check the implementation of price policies, and create favorable conditions for spring material exchange. The North China region should comprehensively summarize and check the implementation of commodity prices, commodity price differences, and commercial adjustment policies and the degree of market activity in the recent period, so as to have a clear understanding, so as to deeply implement policies, arrange the market well, facilitate material exchange, and enable the normal development of public-private relations and labor-capital relations.

    加强物资交流，进一步活跃市场
    华北商业管理局副局长  姚会宾
    华北地区自从贯彻中央关于调整商业的指示以来，市场日趋活跃，这对国家经济建设极为有利。目前正值农业生产季节，各地基本建设又已动工，这都需要市场供应大量生产资料和生活资料；同时农民积压的部分小土产和手工业者的产品要求出售，城市工业品也须要继续收购和推销。但目前淡季已经来临，加以有些已实行经济核算制的国营商业单位，在资金初步核定以后，由于害怕商品积压，“只愿销货，不愿进货”，或者“多出少进”，很多单位商品品种因而减少，卖钱额下降，购销计划不能按时完成，并且造成市场上某些商品供应不足的现象。有些正在进行经济核算的单位，没有把建立批发站、核定资金工作和购销业务很好地结合起来，放松了供应农村生产资料和生活资料的工作，粮食和工业器材等的及时供应和某些季节性商品的收购做得也很差，还有很多业务部门和行政部门的干部，没有认清工、农业生产日益发展、城乡居民购买力迅速提高、国家进入大规模经济建设时期等新的有利的情况，而抱着经验主义的看法，强调“春季是淡季”，因此对春季物资交流工作，不去积极地加以领导和组织。此外，有些私营工商业者，在调整商业以后，尤其是在国营贸易，合作社紧缩机构的地区，非法投机的行为又在开始滋长，造成了某些初级市场的混乱现象。这对广大城乡的物资交流都是很不利的。
    为了正确地贯彻中央调整商业的指示，支持工农业生产，大力推销工业品，更好地为国家经济建设服务，我们必须加强春季物资交流工作的组织和领导，以进一步活跃各地市场。为此，我们应采取如下措施：
    一、大力开展国营商业的购销业务，为完成二季度的购销计划而斗争。必须批评与克服单纯的“怕积压”不怕脱销的对工农业生产对消费者不负责的思想，只愿销货、不愿进货、或只愿进名牌货不愿进当地非名牌货的保守思想，发挥国营商业对市场的领导作用，组织物资交流，通过签订合同、平衡计划等工作，解决大宗商品积压和产销、供求脱节的问题；研究当前市场和业务经营上存在的主要问题，根据具体情况，提出新的奋斗目标，保证完成购销计划；在国营公司和合作社内部的上下之间、部门与部门之间组织交流会议；召开消费者或贩运者座谈会，了解供需情况，通过各种不同形式的会议，组织物资交流工作，各地并应根据具体情况，创造新的内容丰富的物资交流形式。
    二、加强并改进初级市场的领导，开好物资交流会（重点是中级与初级市场的小型物资交流会）。开展春季物资交流的重要环节之一是整顿初级市场，因为它是联系城市与乡村的桥梁。但目前各地初级市场仍普遍地存在着不同程度的混乱现象，一些不必要的管理措施和任意干涉市场的无组织无纪律现象，尚未完全得到纠正。华北各地工商行政部门应很好地对干部进行政策教育，并认真地审查价格政策，使大家认识到市场管理的目的是为了发展生产和活跃物资交流，一方面要坚决限制不法商人的抬价杀价投机操纵行为，另一方面要组织和指导物资交流，贯彻国内贸易自由的政策；并须对所属范围内的市场，进行一次深入检查。根据季节特点和调整商业以后新的市场情况，华北各地要开好小型物资交流会，应采取以下办法：
    （一）在当地物资交流委员会（无此组织的县镇，应以当地工商行政部门为主，吸收国营贸易、合作社、税务、银行、交通运输等部门，及工商业联合会和有代表性的私商参加共同组成）统一领导下，加强当地各种庙会、骡马大会的组织与领导，使其为物资交流服务；并有组织有领导地准备和召开春季物资交流会。它的任务主要是解决农民剩余的小土产、小手工业产品的推销和农具、肥料、牲畜、建筑器材、工业品的供应问题。根据群众要求，可适当进行有内容的商品展览，并加强政治宣传工作。
    （二）充分发动私商、小贩和手工业者参加交易，解决农民小土产的销路和农具的供应问题。因此，一方面要教育干部坚决贯彻党和人民政府的政策，积极地组织私商为城乡物资交流服务；另一方面要改进市场管理，防止某些非法私商投机行为的滋长，便利物资交流。对屡经教育不改的非法私商，必须加以处理，以树立新的经营作风。
    （三）初级市场小型物资交流会上，应以现款现货为主。当地国营贸易应坚决贯彻批发为主的方针，以支持合作社和领导市场。
    （四）小型物资交流会要完全适应当地的产销情况和群众需要，需要召开就召开，不需要时就不召开；群众存在什么问题就解决什么问题，能解决多大的问题就解决多大的问题；反对不根据实际情况，采取硬性的行政命令办法和盲目号召、追求数字以及铺张浪费的思想和作法。
    三、认真监督合同、协议实现，促进物资交流。
    一九五二年华北物资交流大会和各地举行的物资交流会共计成交十一万亿元以上，其中合同、协议占的比重很大，并且很大部分是今年执行的期货合同。因此，督促以上合同全部实现，实为加强春季物资交流的重要组织工作。建议华北各地财委着手检查当地国营企业、合作社和私营工商业间合同、协议执行的情况，使执行合同部门认识合同的严肃性、法律性，切实执行，不容轻易撤销。如因特殊情况，确实不能执行，须征得对方同意，并经上级财委批准，方可修改或解除。各地检查结果并应报华北合同协议执行检查委员会。
    四、正确贯彻中央关于调整商业的指示，检查价格政策执行情况，为春季物资交流创造有利条件。华北各地最近期间应全面地总结和检查一次商品价格、商品差价、调整商业政策的执行情况和市场活跃程度，求得心中有数，以便深入贯彻政策，把市场安排好，便利物资交流和使公私关系与劳资关系得到正常发展。
