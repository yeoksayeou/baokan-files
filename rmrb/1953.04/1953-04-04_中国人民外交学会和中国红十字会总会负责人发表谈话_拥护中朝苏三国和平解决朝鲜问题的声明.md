Heads of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and the Red Cross Society of China Issue Statements
Supporting the Sino-Korean-Soviet Statement on Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue

Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, spoke to a reporter from this agency regarding the statement issued by our Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, Korean Premier Kim Il-sung, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, saying: The statement by Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Kim Il-sung on the Korean armistice negotiation issue fully expresses the consistent determination of the Chinese and Korean governments and peoples to love and uphold peace. People all over the world can clearly see that the Chinese and Korean sides have once again demonstrated a pioneering spirit in striving for a fair and reasonable resolution of the Korean issue.

After the statement by Premier Zhou and Premier Kim, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov of our great ally issued a statement warmly supporting the completely just proposals of the Chinese and Korean sides and expressing willingness to do everything possible to promote their realization. This expression by the Soviet Foreign Minister is a manifestation of the Soviet Union's consistent adherence to a policy of peace and its efforts to fight for peace in the Far East and the world, and it also fully proves the unity and common determination of the world's peace and democracy camp to strive for peace.

The statement by Premier Zhou and Premier Kim gives hope for an early end to the bloody war in Korea. Now it depends on whether the United Nations forces side truly have sincerity in ending this bloody war.

The Chinese and Korean people, as well as the people of the whole world, will unite more closely, heighten their vigilance, and strive to the end for the armistice in Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd: Peng Zemin, Vice President of the Red Cross Society of China, recently spoke to a reporter from this agency regarding the statement by our Premier Zhou Enlai, Korean Premier Kim Il-sung, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, saying: The statement by our Premier Zhou Enlai and Korean Premier Kim Il-sung demonstrates the consistent adherence to a policy of peace by our government and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov of our great ally issued a statement expressing complete agreement with the just proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by China and Korea. These three statements represent the sincere aspirations of peace-loving people all over the world.

Based on the position of peace and humanitarianism, the Red Cross Society of China warmly supports the statements of Premier Zhou Enlai, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov, and demands that the United Nations forces side adopt the same sincere attitude as the Chinese and Korean sides in striving for a fundamental end to the Korean War, not only exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war, but also comprehensively resolving the entire prisoner of war issue, in order to achieve an armistice in Korea and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
