Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    American car sales problems reflect the weakness of the American economy.

    This industry, the most prosperous in post-war America, is now finding it increasingly difficult to sell its products. Car dealers are relying on credit to push sales of large quantities of stagnant new and used cars and are engaging in fierce competition using "discount" methods.

    According to American business publications, about 75 percent of current American car sales are maintained by installment payment methods. In order to attract customers, American car companies have generally extended the payment period from one and a half years to two years, and in some cases even to two and a half to three years.

    In order to compete for the market, Chrysler Corporation, one of the largest car companies in the United States, has announced that it will reduce the price of its cars by an average of $100. At the same time, the company has launched a campaign to promote "used cars." It is estimated that there are about three million of these unsold used cars. According to the "Daily Worker," Chrysler's important product, the "Plymouth" brand of car, has reduced production by nearly one-fifth compared to a year ago. A quarter of the equipment used to produce these cars is idle.

    美国汽车销售越来越困难
    据新华社讯：美国汽车销路问题反映了美国经济的虚弱情况。
    现在，这一美国战后最兴盛的工业愈来愈感到出品销路的困难。汽车商人正依靠赊账办法来推销大量呆滞的新旧汽车，并用“减价”的办法进行剧烈的竞争。
    据美国商业刊物说，美国目前的汽车销路约有百分之七十五是靠分期付款购买的办法来维持的。美国汽车公司为了招徕顾客，已普遍地把付款的期限从一年半延至两年，有的甚至延长至两年半至三年。
    为了争夺市场，美国最大的汽车公司之一克莱斯勒汽车公司已宣布该公司生产的汽车平均减价一百美元。同时，该公司还发起了推销“旧车”运动。这种销不出去的旧车据估计约有三百万辆。据“工人日报”报道，克莱斯勒汽车公司的重要产品“顺风”牌汽车目前比一年前已减产将近五分之一。生产这种汽车的设备有四分之一在闲着。
