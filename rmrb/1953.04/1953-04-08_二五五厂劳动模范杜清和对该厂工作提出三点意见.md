Reader's Letters Abstract

    Du Qinghe, a labor model from Factory 255, wrote a letter presenting three suggestions for the factory's work:
    I am Du Qinghe, a labor model from Factory 255. Last year, our team won a victory on the production front, and I was invited to Beijing to participate in the National "May Day" celebrations. I fully understand that this is the result of the Party's cultivation and care. After returning from Beijing, the CPC Luzhou Municipal Committee sent a working group to work with our factory's Party, administration, and trade union to regularly conduct collectivist ideological education for us, guiding us to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and also helping us learn technology. Last year, during the "finding skills" campaign, the comrades in our group deeply felt the pain of not being able to draw blueprints. This year, everyone is eager to improve their technical theory and learn drafting in order to win victories in large-scale economic construction. I reported this opinion to the Party, and the Party immediately urged the administration and trade union to invite technicians to give us lessons. The Party cares about us so much, we will definitely study hard.
    However, there are still the following situations that I think should be quickly improved: (1) The factory has not done enough to help us improve and promote advanced technical experience. For example, in the process of modifying old machine tools for high-speed cutting, the administration believed that high-speed cutting could only be used for roughing and not for precision machining, thus limiting the timely and widespread promotion of this experience. We requested to purchase high-speed cutting tools, but the higher authorities did not solve the problem in time. Last September, we put forward a rationalization proposal for automatic tool retraction and automatic gate lifting for high-speed cutting. The administration believed that automatic tool retraction was "unreliable" and decided to postpone its implementation. Due to insufficient support from the administration for the automatic gate lifting part, we had to work on the job while designing and drawing, and even estimating work and materials ourselves. Therefore, the progress was very slow, and it was not successfully tested until early January this year. (2) The trade union has also done poorly in summarizing production experience in depth in the workshop. They usually do not summarize production experience well, and only tell us to "seize" it when materials are needed. For example, this year, when the chairman of our factory's trade union went to Beijing for a meeting, he only issued an outline on the same night and asked us to summarize it, which was needed by the afternoon of the next day. Of course, the things summarized in this way will not be good. (3) Too many meetings affect production. I now hold the following positions: Director of the Workshop Rationalization Proposal Committee, Executive Committee Member of the Factory Trade Union, Director of the Factory China-Soviet Friendship Association, Member of the Factory and Workshop Production Reform Committee, Member of the Committee for Implementing the Marriage Law, Member of the Luzhou Municipal Consultative Committee, Director of the Luzhou Municipal China-Soviet Friendship Association, and Member of the Preparatory Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions. Therefore, production and meetings are often delayed.

### 二五五厂劳动模范杜清和对该厂工作提出三点意见

    二五五厂劳动模范杜清和对该厂工作提出三点意见
    二五五厂劳动模范杜清和来信：去年我们小组在生产战线上打了胜仗，我还被邀请到北京参加全国“五一”观礼。我完全懂得：这是党培养和关怀的结果。我从北京回来后，中共泸州市委派工作组协同我们工厂的党、行政和工会经常对我们进行集体主义的思想教育，引导我们展开批评和自我批评，还帮助我们学习技术。去年在找窍门运动中，我们小组的同志深刻地感到不会绘图的痛苦；今年，大家都迫切要求提高技术理论，学制图，好在大规模的经济建设中打胜仗。我把这意见反映给党，党立刻推动行政和工会请技术人员给我们上课。党这样关心我们，我们一定好好学习。
    但是，现在还有以下情况，我认为是应该迅速改进的：（一）工厂在帮助我们提高和推广先进技术经验方面还作得不够。例如我们在改装旧机床进行高速切削过程中，行政上认为高速切削只能车粗活，不能精车，因而限制了这一经验的及时普遍推广。我们要求购买高速切削的工具，上级也没有及时解决。去年九月间，我们提出高速切削自动退刀、自动提闸的合理化建议。行政方面认为自动退刀“靠不住”，而决定暂缓推行。自动提闸部分，因为行政方面支持不够，我们一方面要干活，一方面又要设计绘图，连估工估料也要我们自己搞，因此进行得很慢，直到今年一月初才试验成功。（二）工会在深入车间总结生产经验方面也做得较差。他们平时没有很好总结生产经验，到需用材料时才叫我们“紧抓”。例如今年我厂工会主席到北京开会，当天晚上才出提纲叫我们总结，第二天下午就要。这样总结出来的东西当然不会好。（三）开会过多影响生产。现在我身兼如下几个职务：车间合理化建议委员会主任委员、厂工会执行委员、厂中苏友好协会干事、厂部和车间生产改革委员会委员、贯彻婚姻法委员会委员、泸州市协商委员会委员、泸州市中苏友好协会干事、四川省总工会筹备委员。因此，经常弄得生产、开会都耽误了。
