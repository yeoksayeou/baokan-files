According to an investigation by the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions: some factories in the city have not seriously publicized and implemented the Marriage Law, so many married female workers are being abused by their parents-in-law and husbands. All or most of their wages are handed over to the family. Their nutrition is extremely poor, seriously affecting their production and health, and even the health of their children.

The bobbin winding, yarn reeling, and packaging workshop of the state-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill has a total of 401 employees, including 331 female workers. There are 277 married employees, of which 234 were arranged marriages. Among the female workers with arranged marriages, half cannot control their own wages. Some must hand over all their wages to their husband's family; some must have their wages collected by their husbands, and they never see them at all; some must divide their wages in half, giving one half to their own family and the other half to their husband's family. Female worker Zhu Zhao has been working for eleven years. Every time wages are paid, she only sees the pay slip and not the money. She can only spend 1,000 yuan on food in the factory every day. Once, because she was pregnant and couldn't eat, the union group leader helped her ask her husband (who also works in the factory) for some money, but she didn't dare to take it herself. Female worker Qin Shuzhen wanted to buy a piece of clothing when she received her wages, but her mother-in-law scolded her. As a result, she often didn't want to go to work because of family disputes, becoming the person with the highest absenteeism rate in the entire workshop. When she is at work, her production morale is also very low. When learning new work methods, she forgets them as she learns them. When comrades asked her why, she said, "I won't say; it's useless to say. My mind is very confused. There's always trouble at home, and I can't calm down." He Wang, a combining silk female worker, is only given 500 yuan for food by her mother-in-law every day, and she cannot rest well when she returns home every day, so she is always dozing off while working. Female worker Wang Shuzhen was overworked and anemic during childbirth, and could not go to work for a while. She needed a good rest, but at home she was forced to undertake many heavy labors, so that she could not recover her health and return to work for a long time. Similar situations exist for yarn reeling female worker Zhu Zhao, combining silk female worker Ma Shiyun, and others. Some female workers have to undertake heavy household labor after getting off work, serving their parents-in-law and husbands. Because they do not get enough rest, their work efficiency is very low, and they are often absent. Currently, among the 401 employees in the bobbin winding, yarn reeling, and packaging workshop of the Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill, 75 are absent, 70 of whom are female workers, most of whom cannot go to work due to illness or family disputes. All of this is caused by feudal marriage.

Other factories have similar situations. Yan Shuqin, a female worker at the Tianjin Cotton Weaving Factory, is 29 years old. She started working at the age of fifteen. Now her monthly salary is 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, and her husband is unemployed. She gives all her monthly salary to her mother-in-law, and sometimes she is beaten and scolded by her husband. In 1951, she was forced to work by her mother-in-law only three days after giving birth, which caused her to suffer from postpartum illness. But this year, in January, she was still forced to work by her mother-in-law only three days after giving birth. Some female workers are not actually able to enjoy the maternity leave stipulated by the Labor Insurance Regulations. A female worker at the Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Mill has a monthly salary of 400,000 yuan and needs to support her husband, two children, and herself. Because it is not enough to cover expenses, her children have rickets; while her husband's monthly salary of 500,000 yuan is all given to his mother alone. Zhang Shulan, a female worker in the middle packaging department of the Tianjin Hengda Tobacco Factory, gives her salary for the first half of the month to her family, which is a better situation, so her production morale is higher, and her daily output is 1,700 packages; the salary for the second half of the month, even the pay slip, must be given to her mother-in-law, her production morale is very bad, and her daily output is only about 1,400 packages. Ma Shufang, a female worker at the Tianjin Knitting Factory, gives all of her 100 points of monthly salary to her mother-in-law, and her mother-in-law only gives her 2,000 yuan for meals every day. She cannot get enough to eat every day, so her physical strength is very poor. Generally, workers can watch two machines, and each machine can weave 68 pairs of socks. Ma Shufang can only watch one machine and can only weave 60 pairs of socks. Later, she asked to watch two machines, and the administration agreed, but because she was too weak, she couldn't stand it when watching the machine and fainted on the ground. When she was pregnant with her third child, she miscarried because she fell while swatting a mosquito. In fact, her family's life is not difficult. There are five people in her family: her father-in-law, mother-in-law, husband, children, and herself. Her and her husband's salaries are each 100 points per month, and her father-in-law also has a monthly salary income, but her mother-in-law only gives her 2,000 yuan for meals every day! Recently, it has been increased to 3,000 yuan, but it is obviously still very unreasonable. So some female workers said, "In the factory, we are the masters, at home, we are slaves."

Some of these problems have been initially resolved, and good results have occurred. For example, Li Xiufen, a female worker at the cloth factory of the No. 3 Cotton Mill, refused to set a production plan when the union mobilized her to do so last year, saying, "It's the same whether I set a plan or not, anyway, the money is always completely given to my mother-in-law." After the union negotiated with her mother-in-law, the mother-in-law allowed Li Xiufen to control the wages for the extra production beyond the original daily output of 34 yards. Since then, her daily output has increased from 34 yards to 37 yards, and she has guaranteed quality, and also motivated other female workers. Of course, whether this handling is already reasonable is still a question. Another example is Wang Guirong, a combining silk female worker in the factory. In the past, because her wages had to be completely given to her mother-in-law, she and her children had no money to spend, so she often did not want to go to work; now that her mother-in-law has received education on the Marriage Law, her wages are no longer completely given to her mother-in-law, so she does not take time off, and her output has also increased. Recently, the Tianjin Beiyang Yarn Factory has also improved the production enthusiasm of female workers by appropriately resolving this problem during the publicity of the Marriage Law. For example, Liang Guizhen, a female worker in the factory, used to have no economic independence, had a bad relationship with her mother-in-law and husband, and had very low production morale; recently, after the family relationship was improved, her output has increased from an average of 36 cars in the past to 41 cars, and she has also guaranteed attendance. Li Xianglan, Wang Lishi, and other female workers in the factory have also greatly improved their production morale because they have solved the problems of controlling their own wages and being abused. Zhang Shihua, a female worker at the Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Mill, has always been abused by her husband, and her husband also used her wages to spend on his mistress. Recently, Zhang Shihua divorced her husband, and her production morale has been improving day by day. In the past, she sewed 450 burlap sacks a day, but now she has increased it to 800, setting new records six times.

However, currently, except for a few factories in Tianjin that have carried out the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law relatively smoothly, most factories have not carried it out well. Although many units have also established committees for implementing the Marriage Law movement, the responsible cadres of the Party and the administration have taken a perfunctory attitude, so that the masses cannot be mobilized, the movement cannot be carried out, and most of the above problems have not been resolved. Therefore, carrying out the publicity work of implementing the Marriage Law among workers and workers' families, and then resolving the above-mentioned problems, has become an urgent task at present.

    国营天津第三棉纺织厂等单位应认真贯彻婚姻法
    据天津市总工会调查：该市某些工厂因为没有认真宣传贯彻婚姻法，所以有许多已婚女工受着公婆丈夫的虐待，她们劳动所得的工资全部或绝大部分交与家庭，自己营养极坏，严重地影响了生产和身体的健康，甚至影响了子女的健康。
    国营天津第三棉纺织厂筒子摇纱成包车间，全部职工四百零一人，其中女工三百三十一人。已婚职工二百七十七人，其中被包办结婚的二百三十四人。在被包办结婚的女工中，有半数不能自己支配所得工资。有的须把工资全部交给婆家；有的须由丈夫代领工资，自己根本见不到；有的须把工资分给娘家一半，婆家一半。女工祝赵氏作工十一年了，每次发工资时她只看得见工资条子，看不到钱。她每天在厂内吃饭，只能用一千元菜钱。有一次因为怀孕吃不下饭，工会小组长帮她向她丈夫（也在该厂作工）要了点钱，她自己还不敢去拿。女工秦淑珍在得到工资时想买件衣服，她婆婆就辱骂她，因此她常为家庭纠纷而不愿上工，成了全车间欠勤率最高的人。上工时，她的生产情绪也很低。学新工作法，一边学一边就忘了。同志们问她为什么，她说：“我不说；说了也没用。我脑子乱得很。家里总闹事，我心气沉不下去。”合丝女工毛王氏，婆婆每天只给她五百元菜钱，每天回家时也不能很好地休息，因此工作时总是打盹。女工王淑珍因为平时操劳过重，分娩时贫血，一时不能上工，需要很好的休养，但她在家却被迫担负许多繁重的劳动，以致长期不能养好身体，恢复工作。摇纱女工朱赵氏、合丝女工马世云等，也有类似情况。有的女工在下班回家后，还得担负繁重的家庭劳动，服侍公婆、丈夫。她们因为得不到充分的休息，工作时生产效率很低，而且经常缺勤。目前天津棉纺三厂筒子摇纱成包车间全部职工四百零一人中，欠勤的有七十五人，其中七十个是女工，她们绝大多数是因病或家庭纠纷而不能上工。这都是封建婚姻所造成的。
    其他工厂也有类似的情况。天津棉织工厂女工阎淑琴，现年二十九岁，从十五岁开始做工，现在每月工资五、六十万元，丈夫没工作。她每月的工资全部交给婆婆，有时还得受丈夫的打骂。一九五一年她生下孩子刚三天，就被婆婆逼着去作工，因而得了产后病。但今年一月她生了孩子后，仍然是刚刚三天就又被婆婆逼着去作工。劳动保险条例规定的女工的产假，有些女工实际上是享受不到的。天津棉纺四厂有个女工，每月工资四十万元，需要养活丈夫、两个孩子和她本人。因不够开销，孩子得了软骨病；而她丈夫每月的工资五十万元，却全部交给她婆婆一个人。天津恒大烟厂中包部女工张淑兰，每月上半月的工资交娘家，情况比较好一些，所以她的生产情绪较高，日产量是一千七百包；每月下半月的工资，连工资条都要交给婆婆，她的生产情绪便很坏，日产量只是一千四百包左右。天津针织厂女工马淑芳，每月工资一百分，全部交给她婆婆，婆婆每天只给她二千元的餐费。她每天吃不饱，因而体力很差。一般工人能看两台车，每台车可以织袜六十八双。马淑芳只能看一台车，且只能织袜六十双。后来她要求看两台车，行政上同意了，但她因身体过于虚弱，看车时支持不住，竟昏倒在地上。当她怀第三个孩子时，因为打个蚊子就摔倒小产了。其实她家生活并不困难，公公、婆婆、丈夫、孩子和她本人一共五口，她和丈夫的工资每月各一百分，她公公每月还有工资收入，可是婆婆每天只给她二千元的餐费！最近虽然增加到三千元，但显然还是很不合理。所以有的女工说：“在工厂是主人，回家是奴隶。”
    这些问题，有一些经过初步解决，已经发生了好的作用。如棉纺三厂布厂女工李秀芬，去年工会发动她订生产计划时，她不肯订，并说：“订计划不订计划一样，反正钱总是完全交给婆婆。”经工会和她婆婆交涉，婆婆允许除原日产量三十四码的工资以外，多产的工资由李秀芬支配。以后，她的日产量便由三十四码增加到三十七码，并保证了质量，还带动了其他女工。当然，这种处理是否已经合理，仍然是问题。又如该厂合丝女工王桂荣，过去因工资要全部交给婆婆，她和小孩没钱花，她便常常不愿上工；现在婆婆受到了婚姻法的教育，她的工资不再全交婆婆，她便不歇工了，产量也提高了。最近天津北洋纱厂由于在宣传婚姻法时适当地解决了这一问题，也提高了女工的生产积极性。如该厂女工梁桂珍过去经济不得自主，和婆婆、丈夫的关系不好，生产情绪很低；最近家庭关系搞好后，她的产量由过去的三十六车平均提高到四十一车，并且保证了出勤率。该厂女工李香兰，王李氏等，也都因为解决了自己工资支配问题和受虐待等问题，生产情绪大大提高。天津棉纺四厂女工张世华，一向受丈夫虐待，她丈夫还拿她的工资给自己情妇去花。最近张世华和男人离了婚，生产情绪就日见提高。过去她一天缝四百五十条麻袋，现在已提高到八百条，连创新纪录六次。
    但是，目前天津市除少数工厂宣传贯彻婚姻法运动已比较顺利地开展起来以外，大部分工厂还没有很好地开展起来。许多单位虽然也建立了贯彻婚姻法运动委员会，但是党和行政的负责干部抱着敷衍了事的态度，以致群众动不起来，运动无法开展，上述问题大都没有解决。因此，在职工中和职工家属中开展贯彻婚姻法的宣传工作，进而解决上述各种问题，就成了当前的迫切任务。
