Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 17th. The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 13th, commenting on the so-called "factual report" issued by the U.S. Department of Defense, which was prepared to persecute repatriated American sick and wounded prisoners of war and prevent them from revealing the truth. The editorial stated that the official statement of the U.S. Department of Defense, attacking the Korean and Chinese sides for implementing a "softening policy" towards American prisoners of war, shows that the American generals are "eager to spread rumors in public opinion in order to guard against the fact that American prisoners of war (will reveal) that they have never been abused by the communist side."

The "Daily Worker" pointed out that the U.S. Department of Defense's statement acknowledges that prisoners of war have received good treatment, but it refuses to acknowledge the humanitarian motives behind this treatment.

The "Daily Worker" sarcastically exposed the U.S. slanderous propaganda regarding the Korean and Chinese side's policy of lenient treatment of prisoners of war, saying: "If the prisoners of war were being abused, it would have long been portrayed as an indescribable example of communist tyranny. However, since they are being treated very well, this has apparently become an insidious communist conspiracy."

The "Daily Worker" concluded: "The United States did not adopt this (lenient treatment of prisoners of war) approach. Otherwise, there would be no need to send Chiang Kai-shek's torturous prison guards to manage the U.S. prisoner of war camps."

The Austrian "Volksstimme" also published an editorial on the 14th, believing that the U.S. Department of Defense issued the statement because it feared that "thousands of American witnesses who have personally seen the entire bloody deception would expose America's war lies."

The editorial said: Why is the United States so worried even before the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war has even begun? The only reason is, "The United States and its generals instilled a lot of propaganda in their soldiers when they sent them to Korea. However, once their soldiers came into direct contact with the 'enemy,' they must have discovered that this propaganda was a lie."

The "Volksstimme" wrote: There is no doubt that the exchange of prisoners of war has become the biggest headache for the current rulers of the United States. They are "afraid that once the prisoners of war are exchanged, their war propaganda machine will be completely bankrupt."

    英“工人日报”和奥“奥地利人民之声报”同声斥责美国国防部进行诽谤性宣传指出美国害怕交换战俘后战争宣传机器完全破产
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】伦敦“工人日报”十三日发表社论，评论美国国防部发表的准备迫害被遣返的美国伤病战俘和阻止他们透露真相的所谓“事实报告”。社论写道：美国国防部抨击朝中方面对美国战俘实行“软化政策”的官方声明，表明美国将军们“为了防备美国战俘（把他们）从未受到共产党方面虐待的事实泄露出来，而急于在舆论中散布空气”。
    “工人日报”指出：美国国防部的声明承认战俘受到很好的待遇，但是它不肯承认这种待遇后面的人道的动机。
    “工人日报”以讥讽的口吻揭露美国关于朝中方面宽待俘虏政策的诽谤宣传说：“如果战俘是受到虐待，那早就会被描绘成难以形容的共产党暴虐的实例了。可是，由于他们是受到了很好的待遇，于是，这又成了显然是阴险的共产党阴谋。”
    “工人日报”最后写道：美国没有采取这种（宽待战俘的）办法。否则就用不着派蒋介石的从事酷刑拷打的狱卒来管理美方的战俘营了。”
    奥地利的“奥地利人民之声报”十四日也发表社论，认为美国国防部所以发表声明是因为它担心“数千名亲眼看到整个血腥的骗局的美国人证会揭穿美国的战争谎言”。
    社论说：为什么在交换病伤战俘甚至还没有开始之前，美国就这样担心呢？唯一的原因是，“美国和它的将军们在派遣士兵去朝鲜的时候，曾对他们灌输了许多宣传。但是，在他们的士兵一旦与‘敌人’直接接触以后，他们就一定发现这些宣传是说谎。”
    “奥地利人民之声报”写道：毫无疑问，交换战俘成为当今美国统治者最为头痛的一件事。他们“害怕一旦交换战俘以后，他们的战争宣传机器会完全破产”。
