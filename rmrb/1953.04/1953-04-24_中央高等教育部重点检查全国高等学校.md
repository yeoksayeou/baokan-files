    Central Higher Education Ministry Focuses on Inspecting National Universities and Colleges
    To thoroughly carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, effectively improve leadership methods and style, and ensure the completion of the 1953 higher education plan, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government has begun a planned and focused inspection of universities and colleges nationwide. To uniformly handle issues arising from the inspection work, the ministry has also established an inspection work office.
    In February and March, Vice Ministers of Higher Education Yang Xiufeng and Zeng Zhaolun led a team to inspect Tsinghua University, Nankai University, Tianjin University, Shanghai Tongji University, Jiaotong University, Fudan University, and the China Mining Institute. During the inspections, they promptly assisted the schools in resolving several urgent issues. Starting in April, the Ministry of Higher Education organized four inspection teams, led by Vice Ministers Yang Xiufeng, Zeng Zhaolun, and Director of the First Industrial Education Department Li Shusen, to inspect the work of universities and colleges in East China, Northwest China, Northeast China, and Central South China respectively. The main purpose of this inspection is to understand the specific arrangements for this year's higher education tasks in various regions, the progress of teaching reforms in various schools, and the problems that exist. The East China team will focus on understanding the situation and problems of secondary technical education. Problems that can be resolved immediately will be addressed accordingly.

    中央高等教育部重点检查全国高等学校
    中央人民政府高等教育部为了深入进行反官僚主义斗争，切实改进领导方法和领导作风，保证一九五三年高等教育事业计划的完成，已开始对全国高等学校进行有计划有重点的检查工作。为了统一处理检查工作中的问题，该部并成立了检查工作办公室。
    在二、三两个月中，高等教育部副部长杨秀峰、曾昭抡曾率领一部分工作人员检查了清华大学、南开大学、天津大学、上海同济大学、交通大学、复旦大学和中国矿业学院等院校，在检查工作中，及时地帮助各校解决了若干急需解决的问题。从四月开始，高等教育部组织了四个检查组，分别由副部长杨秀峰、曾昭抡、工业教育第一司司长李曙森等领导前往华东、西北、东北和中南等地区检查高等学校工作。这次检查的目的，主要是了解各地具体布置本年度高等教育各项任务、各校进行教学改革的情况和存在的问题。华东组将着重了解中等技术教育的情况及存在的问题，对存在的问题能够立即解决的，即予解决。（新华社）
