Editor's Note: Shandong Province's approach of closely integrating with various tasks to gradually and deeply launch a struggle against bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of law and discipline is correct. In particular, the method of "grasping both ends and driving the middle" has been very effective. This method involves: on the one hand, leading organs and responsible cadres taking the lead from top to bottom, layer by layer, to examine bureaucratic work styles; on the other hand, focusing on handling the most prominent typical bad people and bad deeds. Under the impetus and influence of these two aspects, cadres who are generally tainted with commandism are educated and enlightened to conduct self-criticism and correct their mistakes. As a result, it not only quickly improves and strengthens the relationship between the Party and the masses but also effectively educates most grassroots cadres who only have problems in their work style but are essentially good. This experience is particularly worthy of study and emulation by all regions.

The struggle against bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in Shandong Province has been gradually deepened in close combination with various tasks and has achieved preliminary results in the province. For example, the phenomenon of "multiple administrative orders" from various departments and committees of the Shandong Branch Bureau and various departments of the Provincial Government, as well as the excessive number of meetings, forms, and documents, has been significantly changed. Wherever bad elements have been punished, the people are very happy, the relationship between the Party and the people's government and the masses has been improved, the production enthusiasm and revolutionary initiative of the masses have been enhanced, and the purely task-oriented viewpoint and coercive command style of cadres have been prevented and corrected, thereby promoting the current tasks. The preliminary experiences of this struggle are:
        I. It is necessary to closely integrate with current work and implement the principle of "combating," "preventing," and "correcting" simultaneously. Experience has proven that it is incorrect to oppose this struggle with current work, to carry out this struggle in a blitzkrieg manner divorced from current work, or to oppose bureaucratism with a bureaucratic attitude, only "combating" without "preventing," or "combating" without "correcting." The so-called close integration with various tasks and implementation of the principle of "combating," "preventing," and "correcting" simultaneously means that when deploying various tasks, emphasis should be placed on proceeding from reality, taking into account possible conditions, and taking into account the awareness of cadres and the masses. When assigning tasks, emphasis should be placed on explaining policies, work styles, and methods. When inspecting work, emphasis should be placed on inspecting the correct implementation of policies, work styles, and methods, and deviations should be criticized and corrected in a timely manner. When summarizing work, emphasis should be placed on summarizing the experience of correctly implementing policies, work styles, and methods to seek practical results. For example, when deploying spring plowing and production tasks this year, leaders at all levels criticized the bureaucratic and commandist work styles in last year's spring plowing and agricultural production throughout the year, and at the same time, emphasized the prevention of bureaucratism and commandism. Generally, attention has been paid to adapting to local conditions, proceeding from actual conditions, adopting practical and effective measures, implementing the principle of steady progress, and overcoming the impetuous and rash advancement in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Therefore, the phenomenon of coercion and command in this year's spring plowing and production work has been greatly reduced. In the struggle against bureaucratism, the Commercial Department criticized bureaucratism and adopted specific measures, which have basically eliminated the occurrence of pig mortality accidents. However, some places have not implemented the principle of "combating," "preventing," and "correcting" simultaneously, and the problems of "combating" without "preventing" or "combating" while "committing" have occurred. The Agricultural and Forestry Department's emergency notice in March to hold nine professional meetings and set a deadline for contracting the elimination of pine caterpillars is an example of "combating" without "preventing" and "combating" while "committing."
        II. It is necessary to strictly draw a clear line of demarcation, treat different cases separately, and prevent the method of indiscriminate condemnation or dismissal. For general bureaucratism and commandism, the policy of education and transformation should be firmly implemented, and the method of criticism and self-criticism should be used to correct it. Disciplinary action should only be taken against those who have serious bureaucratism and commandism and have caused huge losses or have repeatedly refused to mend their ways. Those new evil bullies who have degenerated and become corrupted, counter-revolutionaries and class aliens who have infiltrated Party and government organizations, those who suppress democracy and attack critics, and those who have caused massacres and are anti-Party and anti-people elements should be severely punished. Experience has proven that the struggle has been correctly carried out in places where the above principles have been adhered to. For example, the Jiaozhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China publicly handled the typical case of Yuan Kemao, the head of Yuligou Township in Wulian County, who violated laws and disciplines and forced farmer Yuan Fangyi to death, which redressed grievances and made the people happy. (See the report in this newspaper on March 19 for details.) The struggle against bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of law and discipline can also be carried out smoothly. On the contrary, some prefectural committees generally proposed "strict ideological examination, lenient organizational handling, strict handling of those who refuse to examine, and lenient handling of those who thoroughly examine," or generally proposed "publicly handling bureaucrats, commandists, and violators of law and discipline," which caused confusion.
    III. Grasp both ends and drive the middle. One end is that leading organs and leading cadres at all levels, from top to bottom, examine their bureaucratic work styles and lead their subordinates to carry out self-examination layer by layer; the other end is to seize bad people and bad deeds that are notorious, deeply resented by the people, and typical, and handle them publicly; and under the impetus and influence of these two aspects, educate and enlighten the general cadres who are tainted with commandism to consciously conduct self-examination. As a result, it not only quickly improves and strengthens the relationship between the Party and the masses, but also effectively protects and educates most grassroots cadres who only have problems in their work style but are essentially good. For example, the Teng County Prefectural Committee examined the serious errors of bureaucratism, subjectivism, and disregard for organizational discipline in handling the case of Wang Shukun and Wang Shushen, new evil bullies in Zhaowangtang Village, Jining County, at the Party Congress and among the broad masses of cadres. At the same time, based on the instructions of the higher Party committee and reliable materials, the case was correctly handled, and the bad elements Wang Shukun and Wang Shushen were punished. Therefore, it greatly educated the broad masses of cadres, prompting them to consciously examine and expose the serious situation of commandism and violations of law and discipline in the areas they led, and formulated improvement measures.
    IV. It is necessary to start with the key points to promote the general situation so that we can "shoot with a definite target" and hit the key points; otherwise, there will be a tendency for general examination and superficiality. For example, the leading organs of the Shandong Provincial People's Government focused on criticizing the erroneous tendency of Wang Zhe, the director of the Cultural and Educational Department, to suppress criticism and disregard organization and discipline, which promoted the development of the struggle against bureaucratism in the first-level organs of Shandong Province. The Jinan Railway Administration, due to the arbitrary actions of the Party Committee Secretary, led to extremely abnormal leadership conditions. Therefore, it first started by examining the Party Committee system and gradually deepened the struggle against bureaucratism, thus improving the Party Committee system and improving work. On the contrary, those who do not grasp the key points and adopt the method of "mentioning whatever comes to mind" will end up in formalism, which will dissatisfy the masses and delay the development of the struggle.
    V. Through checking and handling letters from the people, carry out and deepen the struggle against bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. In the first half of last year, Party and government organs at all levels in Shandong Province accumulated about 100,000 letters from the people. After sorting out the cases, clarifying the priorities, and distinguishing the urgency, a processing plan was made. Methods such as grasping key points, investigating and handling special cases, and combining mobilization of the masses for processing were adopted. By the end of February, most of the letters from the people accumulated by organs above the county level had been processed. Through the handling of letters from the people, the bureaucratism of the leading organs was deeply exposed, and the broad masses of cadres and the masses were educated and mobilized, which promoted the development of the struggle. For example, Liu Geng Village in Boxing County, which has always been considered a first-class village, was found to have a new evil bully as the Party branch secretary through handling letters from the people. Bu Qinghai, the Party branch secretary of Bu Jia Village in Putai County, let go of a counter-revolutionary element, which was not discovered in the Party rectification but was revealed in the handling of letters from the people. Because the letters from the people were checked and handled carefully, the relationship between the people and the Party and the People's Government became closer. For example, the Shandong Branch Bureau received about 40 to 50 letters from the people every month last year, but in the first week of March this year alone, it received as many as 70 letters.
    VI. Carrying out criticism and self-criticism through Party Congresses and People's Representative Conferences at all levels is an important link in overcoming bureaucratism and commandism and eliminating bad people and bad deeds. For example, at the Party Congress convened by the Huang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, through summarizing work and conducting criticism and self-criticism, self-criticism was launched from the bottom up, and Luan Zaocai, the secretary of the district committee, a bad element who suppressed democracy and attacked the masses, was expelled from the Party. The representatives said one after another: "This is the first time I have received such a profound education." The county also criticized the illegal and undisciplined behavior of Wang Minsheng, the vice president of the County People's Court, at the County People's Congress. At the People's Congress in many counties, in addition to the leaders examining bureaucratism, the representatives also made discipline agreements for the cadres, stipulating that they were not allowed to arbitrarily deprive citizens of their rights, arbitrarily assign labor, arbitrarily raise funds, arbitrarily hold struggle meetings, or suppress democracy and retaliate against grievances. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses to supervise leaders and cadres was greatly improved. And this kind of mass supervision is precisely an indispensable condition for overcoming bureaucratism, commandism, and incidents of violation of law and discipline, and at the same time, it gives play to and consolidates the democratic system inside and outside the Party.
    VII. Give full play to the role of newspapers. In carrying out this struggle, the Shandong newspapers first selected a batch of typical bad people and bad deeds, such as the "Cangshan cotton pulling incident," the "Zhao Wangtang Village incident," the "patient Zhang Kejing maggot death incident," the "Xing Fengqi incident of the Central Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory," and the "Wang Zhe suppression of criticism incident" for continuous reporting, and published the examinations of the relevant responsible cadres, calling on the broad masses of cadres and the masses to conduct discussions and criticisms, which greatly educated the cadres and the masses. In order to make the development of the struggle healthier, model examples such as township cadre Li Ruilan were also reported so that the broad masses of grassroots cadres could follow them. As a result, the role of newspapers has been strengthened, and their credibility has also been improved. Taking the Jinan Dazhong Daily as an example, the average number of letters from readers in the past was 70 or 80 per day, but now it has increased to about 300. The past weakness, ambiguity, and ambiguity of newspapers have begun to change.
    VIII. Take a method that combines punishment and commendation, compares good and bad, and distinguishes rewards and punishments. This is an effective method for overcoming bureaucratism, especially for overcoming commandism and certain violations of law and discipline among the broad masses of grassroots cadres. This not only makes cadres vigilant, but also gives cadres something to follow in their work. For example, Teng County, Linyi, Huang County, and other places, after publicly punishing violators of law and discipline, selected typical good people and good deeds for commendation. Therefore, grassroots cadres generally reflected: "There is a yardstick now." "If we hold such meetings a few more times, it is guaranteed that there will be more and more good people and good deeds, and fewer and fewer bad people and bad deeds."
    Because the struggle against bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of law and discipline is not only a big problem at present, but will also be a big problem for a long time to come, the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee emphasized: Although this struggle has been universally launched in the province, we must still recognize its long-term, complex, and arduous nature and must carry out this struggle unremittingly, steadily, and deeply. The Shandong Branch Bureau discussed how to combine this struggle with various tasks when deploying spring plowing and production work at the Provincial Rural Work Conference and when deploying industrial and mining work at the Industrial Conference. In order to effectively improve the leadership style, the Shandong Branch Bureau made a decision in February this year to work in factories, mines, and rural base points and has dispatched cadres to work in various factories, mines, and rural base points. At present, it is also drawing cadres from directly affiliated organs to go to various places to inspect and help with spring plowing and production work.

    山东省开展反官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪斗争的重要经验
    编者按：山东省密切结合各项工作，逐步深入地展开反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争的做法是正确的，尤其是采取“抓紧两头、带动中间”的办法，收效很大。这办法就是：一面由领导机关和负责干部自上而下地层层带动，检查官僚主义作风；一面抓紧处理最突出的典型坏人坏事，并在这两方面的推动和影响下，教育、启发一般沾染了命令主义作风的干部进行检讨，改正错误。其结果，既迅速改善和密切了党与群众的关系，又切实教育了大多数仅在作风上有毛病而本质尚好的基层干部。这点经验特别值得各地加以研究和效法。
    山东省反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争，密切结合各项工作，已逐步深入展开，并在山东全省取得了初步成绩。如山东分局各部委、省府各部门“政出多门”，乱开会议，乱发表格、文件的现象，已有显著转变。凡已惩处了坏分子的地方，都人心大快，改善了党和人民政府与群众的关系，提高了群众的生产情绪和革命积极性，防止和纠正了干部的单纯任务观点和强迫命令的作风，从而推动了当前各项工作。这一斗争的初步经验是：
        一、必须密切结合当前工作，贯彻“边反”“边防”“边改”的方针。经验证明将开展这一斗争与当前工作对立起来，脱离当前工作用突击方式进行这一斗争，或者以官僚主义态度反对官僚主义，光“反”不“防”、“反”而不“改”，都是不对的。所谓密切结合各项工作，贯彻“边反”“边防”“边改”的方针，就是在布置各项工作时，强调从实际出发，照顾可能条件，照顾干部和群众的觉悟程度，在交代任务时，强调交代政策、作风、方法；在检查工作时，强调检查政策、作风、方法的正确贯彻，及时批判、纠正偏差；在总结工作时，强调总结正确贯彻政策、作风、方法的经验，务求实效，例如今年布置春耕生产任务时，各级领导上都一方面批判了去年春耕及全年农业生产中的官僚主义与命令主义作风，一方面强调了防止官僚主义与命令主义。一般都注意到因地制宜，从实际情况出发，采取了切实可行的有效措施，贯彻稳步前进的方针，克服互助合作运动中的急躁冒进情绪，因而今年春耕生产工作中的强迫命令现象大为减少。商业厅在反官僚主义斗争中，批判了官僚主义，采取了具体办法，已基本杜绝了毛猪死亡事故的发生。而有的地方没有贯彻“边反”“边防”“边改”的方针，就发生了“反”而不“防”，或“边反”“边犯”的毛病。农林厅在三月份内拟召开九个专业会议，限期包干打松毛虫的紧急通知，即是“反”而不“防”“边防”“边犯”的例子。
        二、必须严格划清界限，分别对待，防止一鞭子赶，一脚踢的办法。对一般的官僚主义与命令主义，应坚决贯彻教育改造的方针，采用批评与自我批评的方法纠正之；对那些严重的官僚主义与命令主义并已造成巨大损失或屡教不改者，才给予应得的纪律处分。对于蜕化变质的新恶霸分子、混入党政组织的反革命分子和阶级异己分子，压抑民主打击批评者以至造成惨案的反党反人民分子，则应严予惩处。经验证明，凡坚持贯彻了上述方针的地方，都正确地开展了斗争。如中共胶州地委大张旗鼓地处理了五莲县于里沟乡乡长苑克茂违法乱纪、逼死农民苑芳义的典型案件，使冤狱得伸，人心大快。（详情见本报三月十九日的报道）反官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争也得以顺畅地开展。反之，如有的地委曾一般提出“思想检查从严，组织处理从宽，拒绝检讨者从严，检讨彻底者从宽”，或笼统地提出“大张旗鼓地处理官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪分子”等，就发生了混乱现象。
    三、抓紧两头，带动中间。一头是由各级领导机关和领导干部，自上而下地检讨官僚主义作风，层层带动下级同志开展自我检讨；一头是抓住罪恶昭著，民愤甚大，典型突出的坏人坏事，大张旗鼓地加以处理；并在这两方面的推动和影响下，教育与启发了一般的沾染了命令主义作风的干部，自觉地进行检讨。其结果，既迅速改善和密切了党与群众的关系，又切实保护和教育了大多数仅在作风上有毛病而本质尚好的基层干部。如滕县地委在党代表会议上及广大干部中，检讨了在处理济宁县赵王堂村新恶霸分子王书坤、王书申案件中所犯严重的官僚主义、主观主义、目无组织纪律的错误。同时又依据上级党委的指示及确实材料，正确地处理了这一案件，惩处了坏分子王书坤、王书申。因而，大大地教育了广大干部，促使他们自觉地检讨和揭发了所领导地区的命令主义和违法乱纪的严重情况，并制订了改进办法。
    四、必须从重点入手，推动一般，这样才能“有的放矢”，打中要害；否则，便会发生泛泛检讨、不痛不痒的偏向。如山东省人民政府领导机关重点地批判了文教厅厅长王哲的压制批评、无组织无纪律的错误倾向，就推动了山东省一级机关反官僚主义斗争的开展。济南铁路管理局由于党委书记独断专行，致使领导情况极不正常，于是首先从检查党委制入手，逐步深入开展反官僚主义斗争，这样即健全了党委制，改进了工作。反之，凡不抓重点，采取“有啥提啥”的办法，结果就流于形式，群众不满，推迟了斗争的开展。
    五、通过检查与处理人民来信，开展与深入反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争。山东各级党政机关去年上半年积压人民来信在十万件左右，经过案件排队，查明主次，分清缓急，作出处理计划，并采取了抓住重点，专案查办，结合发动群众、进行处理等办法，至二月底止，县以上机关积压的人民来信，已大部作了处理。通过处理人民来信，既深刻地揭露了领导机关的官僚主义，也教育和发动了广大干部和群众，推动了斗争的开展。如博兴县刘耿村，一向被认为头等村，从处理人民来信中，发现党支部书记是一个新恶霸。蒲台县卜家村乡党支部书记卜庆海放走过反革命分子，在整党中未发现，在处理人民来信中则被揭露出来。由于检查和抓紧处理了人民来信，人民与党和人民政府的关系更加密切了。如山东分局去年每月约收到四、五十封人民来信，今年仅三月份第一周，即收到七十件之多。
    六、通过党代表会议和各界人民代表会议，开展批评与自我批评，是克服官僚主义、命令主义，杜绝坏人坏事的重要环节。如中共黄县县委在该县召开的党代表会议上，通过总结工作，进行批评与自我批评，开展了自下而上的批评，并把压制民主，打击群众的坏分子区委书记栾藻财开除出党，代表们纷纷反映说：“第一次受到这样深刻的教育。”该县又在县人民代表会议上批判了县人民法院副院长王民生的违法乱纪行为，许多县在人民代表会议上，除领导方面检查了官僚主义外，还由代表对干部订了纪律，规定了不准乱剥夺公民权，乱派工，乱筹乱募，乱开斗争会及压抑民主、挟嫌报复等，由此群众监督领导和干部的积极性大大提高了。而这种群众的监督正是克服官僚主义，命令主义，违法乱纪事件必不可少的条件，同时也发挥和巩固了党内外的民主制度。
    七、充分发挥报纸的作用。山东各报在开展这一斗争中，首先选择了一批典型的坏人坏事，如“苍山拔棉事件”“赵王堂村事件”“病员张克敬生蛆致死事件”“中纺印染厂邢凤岐事件”“王哲压制批评事件”等作了连续报道，并发表了有关负责干部的检讨，号召广大干部与群众进行讨论批判，对干部和群众的教育极大。为了使斗争的发展更加健康，又报道了乡干部李瑞兰等模范事例，以使广大下层干部有所遵循。由此，报纸的作用加强了，威信也提高了，以济南大众日报为例，过去读者来信平均每日七、八十件，现在则增至三百件左右。过去报纸的那种软弱无力、模棱两可的情况已开始转变。
    八、要采取惩处与表扬相结合的方法，好坏对比，赏罚分明。这对于克服官僚主义特别是克服广大基层干部中的命令主义与某些违法乱纪现象，是行之有效的方法。这不仅使干部有所警戒，而且使干部在工作中有所遵循。如滕县、临沂、黄县等地，均在大张旗鼓地惩处违法乱纪分子后，又选择了典型的好人好事加以表扬，因而基层干部普遍反映说：“有个尺磅子了。”“这样的会多开几次，保险好人好事越来越多，坏人坏事越来越少。”
    因为反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争，不但在目前是一个大问题，就是在一个长的时期内还将是一个大问题，所以中共中央山东分局强调提出：这一斗争虽已在全省普遍开展起来，但还必须认识其长期性、复杂性和艰巨性，必须坚持不懈地、稳步地、深入地开展这一斗争。山东分局在全省农村工作会议上布置春耕生产工作时，在工业会议上布置工矿工作时，都讨论了如何结合各项工作开展这一斗争的问题。为了切实改进领导作风，山东分局在今年二月作出了工厂矿山、农村基点工作的决定，并已抽派干部深入到各厂矿和农村基点进行工作。目前又正在直属机关抽派干部，分赴各地检查和帮助春耕生产工作。
