Gifts from the People of the Korean East Coast
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhang Jie

On March 10th, heavy snow blanketed the mountains on the east coast. On this freezing day, three Koreans arrived at the Third Battalion headquarters of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. These three guests were Kim Yong-ho, the secretary of the Workers' Party branch of a certain village, Kim Sun-hee, the chairman of the village's Democratic Women's League, and Jeong Gyun-ran, the vice-chairman. They represented the local Korean people in presenting the volunteers with a precious gift—a bouquet of flowers embroidered with colored silk threads, encased in a glass frame. This bouquet embodies the deep friendship of the Korean people for the Chinese People's Volunteers.

This heroic unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers has a very harmonious relationship with the local Korean people, and the soldiers' internationalist actions often greatly move the local people.

One day in early February, the residents had all set out in small boats to fish at sea, leaving only some elderly people in the village. At that time, an enemy warship sailed close to the coast and bombarded the shore with artillery fire. An incendiary bomb struck a thatched cottage in the village, and in an instant, a raging fire broke out.

Wei Xihe, the company commander of the Volunteers who was nearby, saw the fire created by the enemy and immediately gathered his soldiers to fight the fire. The soldiers rushed over from all directions. When enemy shells screamed through the air, they crawled forward. After the shells exploded, they stood up and ran, one after another, plunging into the burning cottage. Deputy Squad Leader Bai Cairu crawled into the house, his eyes constantly watering from the thick smoke and flames. His throat was also severely suffocated, but he tried to open his eyes wide and look around for items to rescue. He found a vat of millet in the corner of the house, picked up the already hot vat and jumped out. Medical orderly Huang Qing's hair was on fire, and his face was blackened by the smoke, but he still rushed into the fire and carried out the homeowner's quilt. Then, Deputy Platoon Leader Deng Jingzhong carried homeowner Li Zhengtai on his back; Company Commander Wei led out an ox, and the other soldiers climbed onto the roof and bravely extinguished the fire.

When Li Zhengtai woke up from his unconsciousness, he saw at a glance that his pots, quilts, basins, jars, and other items were intact on the ground, and seeing the Volunteer soldiers standing beside him guarding him, he couldn't help but shed tears of gratitude.

The story of the Volunteer soldiers rescuing Grandpa Li quickly spread throughout the nearby villages. In addition, many other internationalist deeds of the Volunteer soldiers were praised by the local Korean people. In a certain village, three dying Korean orphans were saved by the Volunteers. Under the soldiers' careful care, the three orphans turned into lively and healthy children. In another place, a villager who accidentally fell into an ice hole was rescued by the Volunteer soldiers and carefully cared for until he recovered his health.

The Korean people also cherish the Volunteers like their own children. The soldiers often found that their dirty clothes had suddenly disappeared, but soon found that the clothes had been washed clean and placed back in their original place, and the worn-out areas had been carefully patched. The cooks soaked soybeans at night to grind them early the next morning, but when they groped their way to the kitchen, they found that the soybeans had already been ground.... The Korean people were afraid that the Volunteer soldiers would not let them do these things, so they rushed to do them.

However, the Korean people felt that this was not enough to represent their feelings. At a mass meeting, they decided to give the Volunteers a gift that could best represent their feelings. They selected the girl with the best embroidery skills to carefully embroider a bouquet of flowers on white silk with the most beautiful colored silk threads.

Kim Yong-ho, the secretary of the Korean Workers' Party branch, and two other representatives presented this meaningful gift to the Third Battalion of a certain unit of the Volunteers. Kim Yong-ho said: "These are fourteen blooming flowers, representing the fourteen provinces of Korea. We know that the Volunteers are a great internationalist army, fighting for the happiness of our Korean people, for the freedom and independence of our Korean people. Then, let the whole of Korea be filled with brilliant flowers! Only in this way can we explain the Volunteer's noble actions, and only in this way can we express our feelings."

In the battalion headquarters, this precious gift was placed in the most prominent place, along with the red flag won by this heroic unit in battle. The next day, heavy snow still fell on the east coast, and the cadres of each company braved the heavy snow to go to the battalion headquarters to see this precious gift. They were to bring the Korean people's feelings and hopes back to the company, tell every soldier, and encourage them to advance victoriously forever.

    朝鲜东海岸人民的礼物
    新华社记者  张结
    三月十日，大雪掩盖了东海岸上的山岭。在这大冷天，有三个朝鲜人来到了中国人民志愿军某部第三营的营部。这三位客人是劳动党某里（村）支部书记金龙浩、里民主妇女同盟的委员长金顺姬和副委员长郑均兰。他们代表当地朝鲜人民来送给志愿军一件珍贵的礼物——罩在玻璃框内的一束用各色丝线绣成的花朵。这束花朵，凝结着朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军深厚的友谊。
    这支中国人民志愿军的英雄部队和当地的朝鲜人民相处得非常融洽，战士们的国际主义的行动常常给当地人民以极大的感动。
    在二月初的一天，居民们都驾起轻便的小船下海打鱼去了，村里只留下了一些老人。当时有一艘敌舰开到近处的海面上，用炮火向岸上轰击。一枚燃烧弹打着了村里的一间茅屋，一瞬间便燃起了熊熊大火。
    正在附近的志愿军的连长卫洗合看到这场敌人制造的大火，马上就召集战士们来救火，战士们急忙从各处汇集过来。当敌人的炮弹嘶叫着飞来时，他们就爬着前进，炮弹爆炸以后，他们就直起身来飞跑，一个接着一个地扑进正在燃烧着的茅屋里去。副班长白彩如钻进屋子，就被浓烟和火苗刺得两眼不断流泪。他的喉咙也被窒息得十分难受，但他努力睁大了两眼四处寻找着要抢救的物件。他发现在屋角落里有一缸小米，就抱起已经发热的米缸跳了出来。卫生员黄清的头发被烧着了，脸上被薰得发黑，他仍然冲进大火里抱出了房主人的被子；接着，副排长邓精忠背出了房主人李正太；卫连长牵出了一条耕牛，其他的战士都爬上屋顶勇敢地扑灭了大火。
    当李正太从昏迷中苏醒过来以后，一眼看见自己的锅、被、盆、罐等物件完好无损地摆在地上，又看到站在旁边守护着他的志愿军战士，不禁流下了感激的热泪。
    志愿军战士抢救李老大爷的事迹，很快就传遍了附近的村庄。另外，还有许多志愿军战士的国际主义的事迹被当地朝鲜人民传颂着。在某村有三个奄奄一息的朝鲜孤儿被志愿军救活了，在战士们的细心照顾下，这三个孤儿变成了活泼健壮的孩子。在另一个地方，一个失足掉进冰窟窿的老乡，被志愿军战士们救出来，并且妥善地照料他恢复了健康。
    朝鲜人民也像爱护自己的子弟一样爱护志愿军。战士们常常发现穿脏了的衣服忽然不见了，但不久又发现衣服被洗得干干净净地放在原处，磨破的地方也都被细心地补上了补钉。炊事员们晚上泡了黄豆准备明天赶早起来磨，可是等他们摸黑到厨房时，却发现黄豆早已被磨好了……。朝鲜人民深怕志愿军战士不肯给他们做这些事情，所以他们就抢着把这些事情做掉了。
    但是，朝鲜人民觉得这样还不能代表他们的心意。在一次群众大会上，他们决定要送给志愿军一件最能代表他们心意的礼物。他们推选了刺绣最好的姑娘，用最美丽的彩色丝线在雪白的绸子上工整地绣了一束花朵。
    朝鲜劳动党支部书记金龙浩和另外两位代表把这件意义深长的礼物献给了志愿军某部第三营。金龙浩说：“这是十四朵盛开的鲜花，代表朝鲜的十四个道（省）。我们知道，志愿军是伟大的国际主义的军队，是为了我们朝鲜人民的幸福，为了我们朝鲜人民的自由和独立而战斗的。那么，就让整个朝鲜都开满灿烂的花朵吧！只有这样，才能说明志愿军崇高的行动，也才能表达出我们的心意。”
    在营部的房子里，这件珍贵的礼品被摆在最明显的地方，和这个英雄部队在战斗中获得的红旗摆在一起。第二天，东海岸上仍然下着漫天大雪，各个连队的干部都冒着大雪赶到营部来看这件珍贵的礼品。他们要把朝鲜人民的心意和希望带回连队，告诉每一个战士，鼓舞着他们永远胜利前进。
