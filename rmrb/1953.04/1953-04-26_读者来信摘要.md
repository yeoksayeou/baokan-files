Reader Letters Abstract

    Two Problems in the Promotion of New Farm Tools

    Editor's Note: The following excerpts from letters reflect two important problems in the work of promoting new farm tools. The promotion of new farm tools must be combined with the teaching of usage techniques so that farmers can use them and thus truly experience the benefits of using new farm tools. Many regions have already paid attention to this work and have achieved beneficial experiences; however, some cadres in some regions do not understand this point. They use coercive measures to "promote" new farm tools, but do not teach farmers how to use them. This not only prevents the new farm tools from becoming tools for farmers to improve production, but also makes them a burden for farmers. The facts revealed in the letter from Lian Muwang and others, farmers of Huanglou North Village, Xiangyuan County, deserve attention from all regions. Regarding the problem of the supply of new farm tool parts, this newspaper's "Reader's Letter Page" column published readers' opinions in August of last year; and on November 20th of last year, it published the decision made by the Central Ministry of Agriculture to solve this problem. According to the situation reflected in the letter from Yan Jingchun and other comrades of the Tangshan Special District Agricultural Supply and Marketing Cooperative, some farm tool factories have not seriously implemented the Ministry of Agriculture's decision. It is hoped that the Ministry of Agriculture will conduct further in-depth inspections to correct the untimely supply of new farm tool parts.

    "Promoting" New Farm Tools Without Teaching Techniques: Waterwheels Left Untended, Walking Plows Asleep

    Letter from Lian Muwang and Lian Huiyun, farmers of Huanglou North Village, Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province (written on their behalf by Cui Yuping): Last year, cadres in our district "promoted" eight new-style walking plows in our village. Because they didn't teach us usage techniques, but insisted that we use them, we carried two plows to the field: one walking plow and one old plow. The walking plow was for dealing with the district cadres, and the old plow was for actual use; when reporting production to the district, we said we were plowing with the walking plow. Cadres from the supply and marketing cooperative, in order to complete the task of selling agricultural chemicals, had village cadres distribute "Gubo Yiduo," "Wang Tong," "Cotton Oil Soap," and other agents (worth a total of 200,000 yuan) to us by household, but they didn't teach us how to use them either. We could only leave the medicines at home. In addition, we installed a waterwheel because the district cadres repeatedly criticized us for having "conservative ideas," and we had to install it. But this waterwheel was installed in a shady ditch, a piece of land that not only doesn't need watering, but also needs drainage in rainy weather! Last year, our village promoted these three things, spending more than forty stone of rice, but it was useless. Someone in our village made up a little song: "The waterwheel is left untended, the walking plow is asleep, the agricultural chemicals are ineffective." This year, the county cooperative wants our village to promote eight walking plows and distribute a batch of agricultural chemicals to our village. If it is still promoted in the old way, our farmers really can't afford it. We hope that the cadres will not only promote new farm tools and agricultural chemicals, but also teach us how to use them and show us how to do it.

    Untimely Supply of New Farm Tool Parts: Walking Plows Dismantled and Parts Sold

    Letter from Yan Jingchun and Gong Dake, Tangshan Special District Agricultural Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Hebei Province: Over the past three years, the Tangshan Special District has promoted more than 5,000 new-style farm tools – walking plows. Walking plows are indeed easier to use than old plows and are also more efficient. Farmers are very welcome. However, the supply of walking plow parts is neither timely nor sufficient. Some farmers have had to leave their plows idle because they could not get replacement parts for the damaged ones. This creates a great obstacle to the work of promoting new farm tools. From last autumn to now, the agricultural supply and marketing cooperatives of various counties in our special district have repeatedly reported this problem to the special district agricultural supply and marketing cooperative, and the special district cooperative has also reported this problem to the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Supply and Marketing Cooperative several times. The provincial cooperative replied that the provincial cooperative was responsible for placing unified orders with factories and then distributing them to the special districts; but the problem has not been resolved to this day. Now is the time to use walking plows, and many farmers who have walking plows urgently need walking plow parts. In order to solve the urgent needs of farmers, the Changli County Agricultural Supply and Marketing Cooperative reluctantly dismantled ten walking plows and sold the parts. The supply of parts for other new farm tools is similar. This problem should be solved quickly.

    Yongnian County Water Conservancy Promotion Cooperative Sends Waterwheels to the Countryside for Loan Sales, Welcomed by the Masses

    Letter from Zhou Qingzhao, Zhaizhai Village, Yongnian County, Hebei Province: In the past, the loan sales station of the Yongnian County Water Conservancy Promotion Cooperative was located in the city, and farmers had to go to the city to borrow and buy waterwheels. Every year during the busy farming season, especially during droughts, farmers who borrowed and bought waterwheels came in an endless stream, like going to a fair in the city. Some farmers had to travel more than a hundred miles to and from the city to borrow a waterwheel, which greatly delayed production. This cooperative changed to the "mobile loan sales station" method this spring. Wherever farmers need waterwheels, they transport the waterwheels there. On April 6, they transported 110 waterwheels to Liu Han, Liu Gu, and other places more than 50 miles away from the county seat, and they were quickly sold on loan. The farmers happily said: The Communist Party and the People's Government are really thinking about the people in everything, and they even send waterwheels to our doorsteps for loan sales. This saves us so much work!

    Poor Quality of Waterwheels Made by Tangshan Dazhong Iron Factory Affects Farmers' Production

    Letter from Ao Fengchun, Office of the Pingquan County Party Committee, Rehe Province: The quality of the Liberation-style waterwheels made by the Tangshan Dazhong Iron Factory is too poor. These waterwheels, after being loaned to farmers, could not suck up water after less than five days. The reason is that the inside of the iron pipe is too rough, and the rubber pads on the iron chain are worn down. Farmers in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth districts of Pingquan County borrowed a total of twenty-three waterwheels, and now they cannot be used. Farmers cannot buy rubber pads even if they want to. The Agricultural Science Section of the Pingquan County People's Government called the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry to ask for rubber pads; but there were none. This has a great impact on this year's drought prevention and drought resistance work. It is hoped that the iron factory can immediately supply rubber pads and improve the quality of future products.

    Huangxian Qiangguo Iron Factory Should Manufacture Waterwheels Needed by Farmers

    Letter from Wang Zhijun, Dianhou Village, Seventh District, Huangxian County, Shandong Province: The waterwheels manufactured by the local state-owned Qiangguo Iron Factory in Huangxian County are not suitable for most farmers. Many farmers have repeatedly made suggestions to the factory, but the factory always uses the excuse that "it has not been approved by the higher authorities" and does not consider them. In the past, the factory manufactured waterwheels with wooden frames and three-inch pipes, which were suitable for both deep and shallow wells, and small donkeys could also pull them, which was very popular among farmers. However, since the second half of 1952, the factory switched to manufacturing Liberation-style waterwheels with three-and-a-half-inch pipes, which are suitable for shallow wells, but small donkeys cannot pull them in deep wells, only large mules. However, most farmers in our county raise small donkeys, and very few raise large mules. As a result, the vast number of farmers in deep-well areas who raise small donkeys have no way to use them. The crops are staring blankly in drought, but they can't get waterwheels to prevent drought and increase production. From last autumn until now, villagers often went to the factory to express their opinions when they went to the city for market or meetings, requesting that a part of the three-inch pipes be manufactured; but the factory has never solved it. Therefore, the Huangxian Cooperative Federation transported more than a hundred waterwheels with three-inch pipes from Penglai County, and the farmers rushed to get them, and they were all loaned out in less than a day. This shows the urgent desire of the farmers in our county for waterwheels with three-inch pipes! It is hoped that the factory can conduct in-depth investigations and research among the masses and manufacture some waterwheels suitable for local use to meet the needs of farmers.

    Agricultural Farms in Various Provinces Should Experiment with and Promote Seed-Drying Methods Suitable for Local Cotton Seeds

    Letter from Zhang Youxin, Technology Office, Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station: Now is the cotton planting season, and I would like to make a suggestion on the issue of cotton seed treatment.
    According to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and through the practice of agricultural labor models in our country, it has been proven that it is very beneficial to fully expose cotton seeds to sunlight before sowing. Cotton seeds that have been exposed to sunlight can significantly improve the germination rate and germination vigor of cotton seedlings, and can advance the maturity period and increase yield. According to experiments by the Ukrainian Cotton Research Institute of the Soviet Union, the germination rate can be increased by 10% to 15%, and the yield can be increased by 1 quintal per hectare. Last year, Qu Yaoli, a famous cotton labor model in our country, adopted this advanced experience of the Soviet Union, which made his cotton emerge seven or eight days earlier than others, and also emerged neatly. The same effect can be obtained by implementing seed-drying methods for seeds of other crops. This work does not require much effort, but it yields many benefits. It is hoped that the Central Ministry of Agriculture will call on the agricultural leading organs and cadres leading agricultural production in various places to vigorously publicize and promote this advanced experience to the masses.

    Reply from the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture

    Letter from the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture: Reader Zhang Youxin's suggestion on fully exposing cotton seeds to sunlight before sowing to improve germination rate and germination vigor is correct. Our department has included seed-drying as an item of cotton seed treatment in the technical guidance outline for rice and cotton this year. Agricultural farms in various provinces should conduct experimental research based on specific conditions such as cotton varieties and local climate, find seed-drying methods suitable for local conditions, and promote them. The method of seed-drying for seeds of other crops is still under experimental research.

    Farmers in the Fifth District of Yuxian County Request Prompt Supply of 666 Insecticide

    Letter from Wang Hong, Fifth District, Yuxian County, Henan Province: At present, red spiders are seriously harmful in our district, threatening the increase in wheat production. The masses have a high enthusiasm for fighting against pests, and they have achieved great results by using manual machinery to capture them. Now that the wheat is about to head, if manual machinery is still used for capture, many wheat seedlings will be knocked down and broken, affecting yield. If soil agents are used, because there are too few sprayers, and the soil agents are less effective, it is impossible to eradicate the red spiders. Now farmers urgently request to use 666 powder and sprayers, but our district does not have these things. Farmers have reflected one after another: Why hasn't 666 powder been sent? It is hoped that the superior people's government will quickly find a way to solve this problem.

    Review of the Blind Promotion of Wheat Seeds by the Fangshan County People's Government, Hebei

    Letter from the Fangshan County People's Government: We lacked study of agricultural technology and our work was sloppy. We blindly promoted Henan white wheat seeds in the local area without considering local conditions and climate conditions, causing irreparable huge losses to the masses and damaging the prestige of the People's Government. The facts are as follows: When winter wheat was sown last autumn, the higher authorities allocated wheat seed loans. The Agricultural Patriotic Production Increase Competition Committee of our county believed that Henan white wheat was a superior variety and blindly decided to promote it in the local area, and decided that the county supply and marketing cooperative would purchase it in a unified manner. The supply and marketing cooperative bought 60,000 catties of Henan white wheat seeds produced in LinYing, Henan from Beijing. We simply did a germination test and thought it was very good. We didn't conduct a farm test, and we didn't consider that LinYing, Henan, is about 2,000 miles away from Fangshan, and there are differences in climate and other conditions between the two places, so we blindly promoted it. The county used this wheat seed to plant 4,000 mu, most of which were in various agricultural production cooperatives and agricultural mutual aid groups. These wheat seeds grew very well at the beginning, but they all froze to death after winter, and there is no hope for the wheat harvest. The masses criticized us and said: "You care about the masses, but don't be too careless!" Although we organized 42 cadres to visit and apologize to various wheat-growing villages after the event, and asked the higher authorities to re-allocate spring wheat seeds (10,000 catties have been allocated), and mobilized the masses to replant spring wheat or plant large fields earlier to reduce losses and recover the impact; but this huge loss cannot be compensated. This incident made us deeply realize how serious the harm of the bureaucratic work style of the leading organs is to the Party and the masses! We must learn from this lesson, strengthen the study of agricultural production policies and technologies in the future, overcome the sloppy and blind emotions in our work, and prevent similar incidents from happening again.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    推广新农具工作中的两个问题
    编者按：下面摘要发表的两封来信，反映了推广新农具工作中的两个重要问题。推广新农具必须结合传授使用技术，使农民能够使用并从而切身体会到使用新农具的好处。很多地区已经重视了这个工作，并取得了有益的经验；但有些地区的某些干部却不了解这点，他们用强迫命令手段“推广”新农具，但却不教给农民使用方法，这就使新农具不但不能成为农民提高生产的工具，反而成为农民的负担。襄垣县黄楼北村农民连木旺等来信所揭发的事实值得引起各地注意。关于新农具零件供应问题，本报“读者来信专页”栏在去年八月曾发表了读者的意见；去年十一月二十日并发表了中央农业部对解决这个问题所作决定。根据唐山专区农业供应社严景春等同志来信反映的情况看来，有些农具制造厂还没认真执行农业部的决定。希望农业部再进行深入检查，纠正新农具零件供应不及时的情况。
    “推广”新农具不传授技术使水车放了哨步犁睡了觉
    山西省襄垣县黄楼北村农民连木旺、连会云来信（崔玉平代笔）：去年我区干部在我们村“推广”了新式步犁八张。因为他们没有教会我们使用技术，但又非让我们使用不行，所以我们上地时就扛两张犁：一张步犁、一张旧犁。步犁是应付区干部的，旧犁是实际使用的；向区上报告生产情况时就说是用步犁耕的。供销社干部为了完成推销农药任务，就让村干部给我们按户分配“古伯依多”、“王铜”、“棉油皂”等药剂（共值二十万元），但也不教给我们使用方法。我们拿到药也只好放在家里。另外，我们还安了部水车，因为区干部再三批评我们有“保守思想”，不安不行。可是这个水车安在一个阴水沟地里，那块地不但用不着浇水，雨天还得排水！去年我们村里推广了这三种东西，共花了四十余石米，但却没顶用。我们村里有人就编出个小歌：“水车放了哨，步犁睡了觉，农药失了效”。今年，县合作社又要我村推广八张步犁，分配我村一批农药。如果还是照老样推广，我们农民实在负担不起。我们希望干部不单单是推广新式农具和农药，还应当教给我们用法，做个样子给我们看看。
    新农具零件供应不及时步犁被拆掉拿零件出卖
    河北省唐山专区农业供应社严景春、宫大可来信：三年来唐山专区已推广了新式农具——步犁五千多部。步犁确实比旧犁好使，效率也高。农民们都很欢迎。但是步犁零件的供应既不及时，又不足。有的农民因为损坏的零件配不到，只好把犁闲放起来。这给推广新农具的工作造成很大的障碍。我专区各县农业供应社由去年秋季至现在屡次向专区农业供应社反映这个问题，专区社也几次向河北省农业供应社反映这个问题。省社曾答复由省社负责向工厂统一订购后发给各专区；但到现在问题并没有解决。现在正是使用步犁的时候，很多有步犁的农民迫切需要步犁零件。昌犁县农业供应社为解决农民迫切的需要，忍痛拆了十架步犁，拿零件出卖。其它新农具的零件供应工作也有类似情况。这个问题，应该赶快解决才好。
    永年县水利推进社下乡贷销水车受到群众欢迎
    河北省永年县寨里村周庆肇来信：永年县水利推进社的贷销站过去设在城里，农民贷购水车就得进城。每年农忙季节，特别是天旱的时候，贷购水车的农民陆续不绝，如同进城赶会。有的农民进城贷一次水车，往返要走一百多里路，很耽误生产。该社在今年春天改用“活动贷销站”的办法，那里农民需用水车，他们就把水车运到那里。四月六日他们运到距县城五十多里的刘汉、刘固等地一百十辆水车，很快就贷销下去了。农民们都高兴地说：共产党、人民政府真是处处为人民打算，贷销水车还送到我们门前来。这为我们省了多少工呀！
    唐山大众铁工厂所制水车质量太差影响农民生产
    中共热河省平泉县委办公室敖凤春来信：唐山大众铁工厂制的解放式水车质量太差。这种水车贷到农民手中，使不到五天就吸不上水来了。原因是铁管里面太不光滑，把铁链子上的胶皮垫磨小了。平泉县第十、十一、十二三个区的农民共贷了二十三台水车，现在都不能使了，农民想买胶皮垫也买不到。平泉县人民政府农业科曾向省农林厅打电话要胶皮垫；但也没有。这对今年的防旱抗旱工作有很大影响。希望铁工厂能马上供应胶皮垫，并改进今后产品的质量。
    黄县强国铁工厂应制造农民需要的水车
    山东省黄县七区殿后村农民王志俊来信：黄县地方国营的强国铁工厂所造水车不适合大多数农民使用。很多农民不断向该厂提出意见，但该厂总以“上级未批准”为辞，不加考虑。该厂过去制造木架子式的水车，管子粗三吋，深井浅井使用都相当，小驴也能拉得动，农民很欢迎。但一九五二年下半年起，该厂改制解放式水车，管子是三吋五分粗，浅井用之相当，用在深井小驴就拉不动了，非大骡子不行。而我县大部农民都养小驴，养大骡子的很少。这样一来，深井地区养小驴的广大农民就没法使了。眼看庄稼馋的干瞪眼，但捞不着水车防旱增产。由去年秋间直到现在，各村农民进城赶集或开会时，常到厂方提意见，要求另造一部分三吋管子；但该厂总是不解决。黄县合作总社因此曾由蓬莱县运来百余部三吋管子的水车，农民争先恐后地要，不到一日就贷完了。这说明了我县农民需要三吋管子水车的迫切心情！希望该厂能深入群众调查研究，制造一些适合当地使用的水车，以满足农民需要。
    各省农场应试验并推广适合当地的棉籽晒种办法
    山西省农业试验场技术室张佑新来信：现在正是种棉花的季节，我对棉花种籽处理问题提出一点建议。
    根据苏联先进经验，并通过我国农业劳动模范的实践，已经证明了播种前将准备用作播种的棉籽在日光下充分曝晒是有很大好处的。经过曝晒后的棉籽可以显著地提高棉苗的发芽率和发芽势，并可提早成熟期，增加产量。根据苏联乌克兰棉作科学研究所的试验，发芽率可以提高百分之十至百分之十五，每公顷增加产量达一公担。去年，我国著名棉花劳动模范曲耀离采用了苏联这一先进经验，使得他的棉花比别人的早出七、八天，而且出得又整齐。其他作物的种子实行晒种办法亦能得到同样效果。这项工作做起来费力不大，而收益良多。希望中央农业部号召各地农业领导机关以及领导农业生产的干部大力向群众宣传并推广这一先进经验。
    中央人民政府农业部的答复
    中央人民政府农业部来信：读者张佑新关于棉花播种前将准备用作播种的棉籽在日光下充分曝晒，以提高发芽率和发芽势的建议是正确的。我部本年在水稻、棉花技术指导纲内，已将晒种列为棉籽处理的一个项目。各省农场应根据棉花品种、当地气候等具体条件试验研究，找出适合当地情况的晒种办法，加以推广。关于其他作物种籽实行晒种办法，尚在试验研究中。
    禹县五区农民要求迅速供应六六六杀虫剂
    河南省禹县五区王宏来信：目前我区红蜘蛛为害很严重，威胁着麦子增产。群众向害虫作斗争的热情很高，他们用人工器械捕捉，收到很大的效果。现在麦子已将出穗，如仍用人工器械捕捉，就会使许多麦苗倒断，影响产量。用土药剂呢，因喷雾器太少，加上土药效力较小，无法根除红蜘蛛。现在农民迫切要求用六六六粉与喷雾器，但我区没有这些东西。农民纷纷反映：六六六粉为什么不发来点呢？这个问题望上级人民政府迅速设法解决。
    河北房山县人民政府对盲目推广麦种的检讨
    房山县人民政府来信：我们对农业技术缺乏学习，工作草率，不因地制宜和照顾气候条件，盲目在本地推广河南白麦种，使群众遭受不可弥补的巨大损失，并损害了人民政府的威信。事实经过是这样：去秋小麦播种时，上级拨来了麦种贷款，我县农业爱国增产竞赛委员会，认为河南白小麦是优种，盲目议决在本地推广，并决定由县供销合作社统一购买。供销合作社就到北京买了河南临颖所产白小麦麦种六万斤。我们只简单地做了发芽试验，认为很好，再没有经过农场试验，更没有考虑到河南临颖离房山约二千来里，两地气候及其它条件有差别，就盲目推广下去了。全县用这个麦种种的地四千亩，大部分在各农业生产合作社和农业互助组。这些小麦种后开始长得很好，一过冬天就冻死了，麦收无望。群众批评我们说：“你们对群众关心，也别太粗心呀！”我们虽则在事后组织了四十二名干部到各种麦区村慰问道歉，并请示上级重拨春麦种（已拨来一万斤），动员群众改播春麦或提早种大田，以减少损失，挽回影响；但这一巨大损失是无法弥补的。这个事件使我们深刻认识到领导机关的官僚主义作风对党对群众有何等严重的危害！我们一定记取这个教训，今后加强农业生产政策和技术的学习，克服工作中的草率盲目情绪，不使类似事件再度发生。
