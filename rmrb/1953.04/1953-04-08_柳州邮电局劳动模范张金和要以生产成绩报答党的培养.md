    Liuzhou Post and Telecommunications Bureau Model Worker Zhang Jinhe Wants to Repay the Party's Nurturing with Production Achievements
    Letter from Zhang Jinhe, model worker of Liuzhou Post and Telecommunications Bureau: I went to Beijing last year to participate in the "May Day" observation ceremony. After returning, I resolved to work and study harder, help and unite other comrades to jointly complete the country's production tasks, and actively find tricks to create wealth for the country. For example, the lightning arrester equipment of the city's telephone exchange in our bureau is not good. When there is a heavy thunderstorm, the number plates on the telephone exchange are easily burned out. Once, fifty-four number plates were burned. The comrades responsible for telephone service have been racking their brains about this for a long time, but they always wanted to wait for the higher authorities to allocate good equipment for replacement. After I knew about this, I thought: there are no lightning arresters for sale in Liuzhou, and it would cost money to buy them elsewhere, and waiting for the allocation from above is not the answer. So I used old steel wire to make four hundred sets of lightning arresters. This not only solved the problem in time, but also saved wealth for the country.
    Under the leadership and cultivation of the Party, although I have achieved some success in production, it is still far from what the people expect of me; and the Party has given me too much. Last September, I participated in the rapid literacy class. After more than 20 days of study, I learned more than 1,000 characters and was able to read short workers' textbooks. Last year I was selected to go to the Hangzhou Post and Telecommunications Sanatorium for recuperation, and I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In January of this year, when the first Guangxi Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union Member Representative Conference was held, I gloriously participated, and was also elected as a member of the first district trade union committee. In the future, I must work harder and never fail the Party's education and the people's expectations of me.

### 柳州邮电局劳动模范张金和要以生产成绩报答党的培养

专栏：读者来信摘要

    柳州邮电局劳动模范张金和要以生产成绩报答党的培养
    柳州邮电局劳动模范张金和来信：我在去年到北京参加“五一”观礼。回来后，我下定决心加倍努力工作和学习，帮助和团结其他同志共同完成国家的生产任务，主动地找窍门，为国家创造财富。如本局市内电话总机的避雷器设备不好，遇到大雷雨时，电话总机上的号牌就容易烧坏，有一次曾烧掉五十四个号牌。负责话务工作的同志虽然长期为这件事伤脑筋，但总想等上面拨好器材来换。我知道这事后，就想：避雷器柳州市没有卖，到别的地方去买要花一笔钱，老等上面拨不是办法。于是就利用旧钢线做了四百付避雷器。这样不但及时解决了问题，还为国家节省了财富。
    在党的领导和培养下，我虽然在生产上获得了一些成绩，但距离人民所期望于我的还很远；而党给我的实在太多了。去年九月我参加了速成识字班，经过二十多天的学习，认识了一千多个字，并能阅读简短的工人课本了。去年我被选到杭州邮电休养所休养，又光荣地加入了中国共产党。今年一月，广西首届邮电工会会员代表大会召开时，我光荣地参加了，同时还被选为第一届的区工会委员。我今后一定要更加努力地工作，决不辜负党对我的教育和人民对我的期望。
