Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Representatives from approximately fifty unions, including the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sōhyō), held a meeting on the 7th to discuss May Day celebrations. The meeting decided that the central slogans for this year's May Day celebrations would be: Oppose remilitarization, stop the Korean War; oppose the Fascistization of Japan, and defend the peace constitution and democracy. The meeting also decided to continue negotiations with the Yoshida government, insisting on holding the May Day commemoration rally in Tokyo's People's Square.

    Right-wing Social Democrats openly opposed the slogan "Stop the War" at the meeting, but they were defeated.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: While the Japanese Yoshida government is doing its utmost to obstruct the Japanese working class from commemorating May Day, it is preparing to use fascists to create bloodshed.

    According to Agence France-Presse: Sources in the Japanese police say that some right-wing groups have decided to use force to disrupt the May Day celebrations held by Japanese workers this year. Among these fascist groups are the so-called "Martyred Youth Corps" and the "Independent Youth Party," who last year assaulted Japanese peace representatives inside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The "Martyred Youth Corps" fascists, known as "Nazi stormtroopers," have prepared weapons – sticks that resemble ancient Japanese swords. They openly declare that they are ready to "fight" at any time. In addition, the Kyushu fascist group "Black Flag Society" is also preparing to mobilize three thousand fascists to stage demonstrations in the streets of Tokyo on May Day and May 3rd, "Constitution Memorial Day," attempting to take the opportunity to create incidents.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Japanese trade union organizations are participating in the general election struggle, and many unions have decided to support anti-war parliamentary candidates.

    Following the decision of the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions to support candidates who oppose war and remilitarization, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sōhyō), with approximately three million members, also decided on five demands at its standing board meeting on the 2nd. Candidates who recognize these five demands will receive the support of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and its affiliated unions. These five demands are: (1) Oppose the San Francisco Peace Treaty, oppose the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and oppose the military budget; (2) Demand the immediate cessation of the Korean War; (3) Oppose the Anti-Strike Law and the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" and other bills that restrict trade union freedom; (4) Strive for a minimum wage of 8,000 yen and establish a minimum wage law; (5) Strive to expand and strengthen the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan.

    The Youth and Women's Department of the All-Japan Federation of Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Unions held a national representative meeting in Himeji on the 2nd and 3rd to discuss the general election policy. The meeting decided to take unified action in the general election, overthrow the Yoshida Liberal Party, and make every effort to ensure that candidates who support peace and promote Japan-China trade are elected.

    日本各工会代表集会决定“五一”节口号
    “总评”宣布支持反对战争的国会议员候选人
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：日本工会总评议会等约五十个工会的代表在七日举行会议，讨论庆祝“五一”节的事情。会议决定今年庆祝“五一”节的中心口号是：反对重整军备，停止朝鲜战争；反对日本法西斯化，保卫和平宪法和民主。会议并决定继续向吉田政府交涉，坚持在东京人民广场举行“五一”节纪念大会的主张。
    右翼社会民主主义者在会上竟公开反对“停止战争”的口号，但是他们遭到了失败。
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：日本吉田政府在极力阻挠日本工人阶级纪念“五一”劳动节的同时，正准备利用法西斯分子来制造流血事件。
    据法新社透露：日本警察方面的消息说，一些右派集团已决意在今年“五一”节用武力破坏日本工人举行庆祝大会。这些法西斯团体中，有去年曾经在外务省内殴打日本和平代表的所谓“殉国青年队”以及“独立青年党”。有“纳粹突击队员”之称的“殉国青年队”法西斯分子已经准备好了武器——样子像日本古剑的棍子。他们公开宣称可以随时“应战”。此外，九州岛的法西斯团体“黑旗会”也准备出动三千名法西斯分子，在“五一”节和五月三日的“宪法纪念日”到东京街头举行示威游行，企图借机制造事件。
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：日本的工会组织正在参加着大选斗争，许多工会已经决定支持反对战争的国会议员候选人。
    继全日本产业别工会会议决定支持反对战争、反对重整军备的候选人之后，拥有会员约三百万人的日本工会总评议会二日在常任理事会中也决定了五项要求，凡是承认这五项要求的候选人，将得到日本工会总评议会和属于它的工会的支持。这五项要求是：（一）反对旧金山和约，反对美日“安全条约”，反对军事预算；（二）要求立即停止朝鲜战争；（三）反对禁止罢工法和“防止破坏活动法”等束缚工会自由的法案；（四）努力争取以八千日元为最低限度的工资，并制定最低工资法；（五）努力扩大并加强日本工会总评议会。
    日本自治团体工会总联合会青年妇女部于二日和三日在姬路召开全国代表会议，讨论大选方针。会议决定在大选中要统一行动，打倒吉田自由党，要尽量使拥护和平和赞成促进日中贸易的候选人当选。
