Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th—The snipers of the Korean People's Army units on the eastern front have widely launched sniper warfare and continue to achieve victories. Snipers belonging to Zhao Yongze's unit killed or wounded 295 enemy soldiers in the past month. Snipers of Li Dongxuan's unit also killed or wounded 314 enemy soldiers in the past forty days.

Many People's Army snipers have record books to avenge the people of the motherland and the fallen comrades, recording every sniping achievement. They are launching competitions to strive for greater kill records. Wu Changwu, a sniper of Zhao Yongze's unit, dug solid sniper trenches in front of the enemy's positions. He killed or wounded 26 US soldiers in thirty days. The great achievements further encouraged the snipers' will to kill the enemy. Sniper Jin Hyun-gu bravely entered an unnamed highland east of Highland 851 and sniped in front of the enemy's positions, killing or wounding six enemy soldiers on March 6. On the evening of March 9, a squad leader and sniper of this unit, Li Jiaowan, sniped several US sentries who were taking over duties on the forward positions, killing or wounding three US soldiers. In the past ten days, he killed or wounded 16 enemy soldiers. Another sniper, Jin Qiantai, also killed or wounded 25 enemy soldiers in the past month.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th—ROK soldiers are starving and their morale is war-weary. Under the heavy blows of the Chinese People's Volunteers, their morale is even lower.

Not long ago, our army captured several soldiers of the ROK 5th Division, who were new recruits who had just completed training on Jeju Island in early October last year. Immediately after completing their training, they were escorted to the front lines by the ROK military police. One of the new recruits said: When our superiors sent us to the front lines, they kept deceiving us, saying that the People's Army had no artillery and could only fight with rifles. However, as soon as we arrived at the front line and entered the communication trench, the People's Army's artillery shells suddenly exploded beside the trench, causing casualties immediately. Not many days later, three people in our company were shot dead by People's Army snipers as soon as they walked out of the trenches. When we went out, we often encountered suddenly bombed artillery shells. Therefore, we did not dare to walk outside the trenches during the day. At night, we couldn't feel at ease. The sound of the wind blowing often made people think it was the whistling of artillery shells, which made them shudder. In the ten days we arrived in the front line area, many soldiers in our company wounded themselves. One soldier deliberately blew off his right hand before being sent off the front line. The first words of several soldiers of the ROK 12th Division after being captured were "We have been hungry for two whole days." They greedily ate the food our army gave them. According to them, ROK soldiers often could only eat one box of rice per meal for five people, and their stomachs were often hungry. They don't want to fight and their morale is getting lower and lower.

Many ROK prisoners also described the tragic lives of the South Korean people and their relatives under the cruel rule of the US-Li bandits. A soldier from the ROK 35th Regiment said: Before I was captured, I passed through my hometown of Baochuan, Gyeonggi-do during a certain mission. I wanted to go home and have a full meal. After arriving home, I learned that because a lot of public grain and miscellaneous taxes were forced to be paid, my family had run out of food in the winter of last year, and even the seeds were eaten. The gaunt faces of my parents and children were really hard to bear. He said: It’s not just my family like this, this is a very common phenomenon in my hometown.

    朝鲜人民军狙击手广泛展开杀敌竞赛
    在我军沉重打击下挨饥受饿的李伪军士兵士气更加低沉
    【新华社平壤十五日电】东线朝鲜人民军各部队的狙击手们广泛展开狙击战，不断地取得胜利。赵永泽所属部队的狙击手，在最近一个月中杀死杀伤了敌军二百九十五人。李东铉部队的狙击手，在最近的四十天中也杀死杀伤敌军三百一十四人。
    人民军的许多狙击手都备有为祖国人民和死难战友报仇的记录本，把自己每一次的狙击战果都记在上面。他们为争取更大的杀敌纪录而展开了竞赛。赵永泽所属部队的狙击手吴长五在敌军阵地前面挖掘了坚固的狙击战壕，他在三十天中就打死打伤了美军二十六人。他取得的巨大战果更加鼓舞了狙击手们的杀敌意志。狙击手金铉九勇敢地进入八五一高地以东的无名高地，在敌军阵地前沿展开狙击，在三月六日那一天就打死打伤了敌军六人。三月九日晚间，这个部队的一个班长、狙击手李教琓，在前沿阵地上狙击正在接替勤务的几个美军哨兵，打死打伤了美军三人；在最近的十天中，他又打死打伤了敌军十六人。另一位狙击手金千泰在最近一个月中也打死打伤了敌军二十五人。
    【新华社平壤十五日电】李伪军士兵挨饥受饿，军心厌战。他们在朝中人民军队的沉重打击下，士气更加低沉。
    不久以前我军俘获了伪军第五师的几个士兵，他们是去年十月初旬才在济州岛结束训练的伪军新兵。他们在刚刚结束训练之后，就被伪宪兵押送到前线作战。其中一个新兵说：我们的上级在把我们送上前线的时候，一直欺骗我们说，人民军没有炮，只能用步枪打仗。但是，我们刚到前线进入交通壕，人民军的炮弹突然在壕边爆炸了，使我们立刻遭到了伤亡。没有过几天，我们连里有三个人刚走出战壕就被人民军的狙击手打死。我们出去时也时常碰到突然轰来的炮弹，因此，我们白天都不敢到战壕外面走动。在夜间，我们更不能安心。风吹草动的声音，往往使人以为是炮弹飞过来的呼啸声而不禁毛骨悚然。在我们到达前线地区的十天中，我们这个连里就有许多士兵自伤。有一个士兵故意炸掉了自己的右手才被送下火线。伪军第十二师的几个士兵被俘之后的第一句话就是“我们已整整饿了两天了”。他们贪婪地吃着我军给他们的食物。据他们说，伪军士兵常常只能五个人一顿吃一饭盒子的饭，肚子经常是饥饿的。他们都不想打仗，士气越来越低落了。
    许多伪军俘虏并述说了南朝鲜人民和自己的亲属在美李匪帮残酷统治下的悲惨生活。伪军第三十五团的一个士兵说：我在被俘之前，曾在某次勤务中途经故乡京畿道抱川。我想回家看看，并且吃一顿饱饭。到家以后，才知道因为被迫缴了很多公粮和杂税，我家在去年冬天就已断了食粮，而且把种籽都吃光了。父母亲和小孩儿的干瘪的脸，看了真使人难受。他说：不只我一家如此，在我故乡一带这是很普遍的现象。
