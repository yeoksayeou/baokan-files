    According to Comrade Stalin's Teachings, Combined with Poland's Specific Situation
    Bierut Proposed Ten Tasks to the Entire United Workers' Party
        [Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 2nd] According to the Polish News Agency, the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party held its eighth plenary session in Warsaw on March 28. At the beginning of the meeting, everyone stood in silence to commemorate the brilliant leader and teacher of the working people of the world and all progressive humanity, J.V. Stalin, and the great leader of the Czechoslovak people, K. Gottwald. The plenary session then listened to a report by B. Bierut, Chairman of the Party Central Committee, entitled: "Comrade Stalin's Immortal Teachings are the Weapon for Further Strengthening the Party and the National Front."
    In his report, Bierut described Comrade Stalin's great contributions to the contemporary era in both theoretical and practical activities. He then recalled Comrade Stalin's concern, guidance, and assistance to the Polish working class and its party, and to the Polish working people. Bierut pointed out: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the most powerful and well-tempered party of the working class in the world, the leading force of the great Soviet state, and its leaders are the most outstanding and loyal students of Lenin and Stalin. The Polish United Workers' Party should, as in the past, regard the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as its example for learning, constantly comprehend and study Comrade Stalin's teachings, and more effectively apply these teachings in its daily work. Based on Comrade Stalin's teachings and combined with the specific situation in Poland, Bierut proposed ten tasks to the entire party: to continuously strengthen the party ranks, strengthen the party's ideological and organizational unity, raise the political awareness and enthusiasm of party members, strengthen the combination of theory and practice, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, strengthen the national front and strengthen the party's daily contact with the vast masses, continuously mobilize the working people to actively complete production tasks, oppose bureaucracy, strengthen the people's regime and national defense forces, strengthen the world peace camp, and consolidate friendly relations with the Soviet Union. After discussion, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party adopted a resolution, taking Bierut's report as the guiding principle for the work of party organizations at all levels.

    根据斯大林同志的学说，结合波兰的具体情况
    贝鲁特向统一工人党全党提出十项任务
        【新华社二日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会三月二十八日在华沙举行了第八次全体会议。会议开始后，全体肃立，默念全世界劳动人民和一切进步人类的光辉领袖和导师约·维·斯大林和捷克斯洛伐克人民的伟大领袖克·哥特瓦尔德。全体会议接着听取了党中央委员会主席波·贝鲁特的报告，题目是：“斯大林同志的不朽学说是进一步加强党和全国阵线的武器”。
    贝鲁特在报告中叙述了斯大林同志在理论活动上和在实际活动上给予当代的伟大贡献。接着他追述了斯大林同志给予波兰工人阶级及其政党和波兰劳动人民的关怀、指导和帮助。贝鲁特指出：苏联共产党是全世界最强大的百炼成钢的工人阶级政党，是伟大苏维埃国家的领导力量，它的领袖们都是列宁和斯大林最优秀的最忠实的学生。波兰统一工人党要像过去一样把苏联共产党当作自己学习的榜样，不断地领会和研究斯大林同志的学说，更有效地在日常工作中运用这种学说。贝鲁特根据斯大林同志的学说，结合波兰的具体情况，向全党提出十项任务：不断地壮大党的队伍，加强党在思想上和组织上的统一，提高党员的政治觉悟和积极性，加强理论与实际的结合，加强工农联盟、壮大全国阵线和加强党与千百万群众的日常联系，不断动员劳动人民积极完成生产任务，反对官僚主义，加强人民政权和国防力量，加强世界和平阵营，巩固和苏联的友好关系。 波兰统一工人党中央委员会全体会议经过讨论，通过决议，以贝鲁特的报告为全党各级组织的工作的指导原则。
