    Hailong County Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative Changes the System of Converting Livestock into Shares to Private Rental

    The Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xitaiping Village, Hailong County, Liaodong Province, was established this spring. The cooperative has twenty-five households, four of which own horses. These horses were all valued and converted into shares in the cooperative. The cooperative borrowed a portion of its loan from the government, coupled with the horse prices due this year, and thus shouldered a lot of debt; most of the households without horses were worried that their income would decrease in the autumn, causing them to be emotionally uneasy. In order to solve this problem, the CPC Hailong County Committee called on the cooperative to change the method of valuing carts and horses as shares in the cooperative to a method of renting them from the members by the cooperative, in order to reduce debt and reassure the cooperative members.
    On April 3rd, the cooperative held a members' meeting to discuss this issue. Liu, the County Head of Hailong County, attended the meeting. The households without horses spoke at the meeting and agreed with the method of renting horses. However, the households with horses had different opinions. Some said, "The manure is almost delivered, and land is about to be sown, but now you want to change things, I won't do it, it's better to just sell them to the cooperative." Others said, "Then forget it, what are we changing for? Just consider my horse as being used for free by you, I don't want any rent, and I won't pay insurance." In the end, the two sides even started arguing. County Head Liu thought to himself: Why do the households with horses disagree with changing the method? There must be many problems in between. He decided to first understand the ideological situation of the masses and then discuss the problem.
    The next day, because the problem was not resolved, the members were unwilling to participate in production. Out of the twenty-seven male laborers in the whole cooperative, only the cooperative director Dong Dianqing (the CPC branch secretary) led Li Yaoting (a member of the Communist Youth League) to collect manure, and the other members did not work. The households with horses were all sulking at home. County Head Liu went to conduct individual talks with them. After repeated mobilization, the households with horses finally revealed what was on their minds. Han Wanlu said, "If we change like this, then the horse might as well be used for free by the cooperative. The insurance premium is over 100,000 yuan a year, and there's also the substitute labor grain; getting a shi and a few dou of rent, what's left after deducting the insurance premium?" Wang Guozhi said, "If our horses are rented to others, they are not publicly owned. What if they are not properly fed? People are selfish, wouldn't there be quarrels and famines every other day? If my horse is fed until it's thin, who is responsible? What if its eyes are blinded?" After listening to these opinions, County Head Liu went to study the construction of the cooperative with the branch secretary, and this clarified the problem. It turned out that at the beginning of the cooperative's formation, the households with horses were originally reluctant to have their horses join the cooperative. However, they saw that many cooperatives had implemented the method of carts and horses joining the cooperative, so they believed that carts and horses would have to join the cooperative sooner or later, and it would be better to join sooner rather than later, and also get a good reputation for being "progressive." After the cooperative was established, many systems were not yet sound, and the members did not take good care of public property. Now that the horses were changed from being publicly owned to privately owned, they could not see the benefits of this for a while, but they thought of a series of problems such as feeding, use, insurance premiums, substitute labor grain, medical expenses, and how the horse should rest when it had a foal. Now, only by first solving these specific problems can we open up the minds of the members, so that the households with and without horses do not suffer losses, and they can unite to carry out production.
    County Head Liu and Director Dong then convened a meeting of cooperative cadres and activists, so that everyone could understand this situation, and they preliminarily checked the problems of unsound systems and lax labor discipline in the cooperative in the past, and also studied ways to solve these problems. Then a members' meeting was convened, and after repeated discussions by the members, all the problems were reasonably solved. The households with horses were most afraid of not feeding the horses well, so everyone elected Old Han to be specially responsible for feeding the horses; he has a good heart, can get up at night, and feeds them well. Specific guarantees were also made regarding how much forage should be given to the livestock during the busy farming season to keep the livestock in good condition. Regarding the issue of households with horses disliking the low rent, everyone unanimously believed that there were few households with horses in the cooperative, and the burden on the horses was also heavy, so the rent should be higher than in previous years. In this way, the problems of households with horses paying their own insurance premiums, substitute labor grain, etc., were easily solved. Regarding the issue of the horse's medical expenses, everyone unanimously believed that if the livestock gets sick from working hard for the cooperative, it should be treated by the cooperative; if it is an old or chronic disease, the horse owner should bear it at their discretion. The rest time before and after the horse has a foal was also stipulated. At the members' meeting, County Head Liu, based on the specific situation of the cooperative's poor family background and heavy burden, explained to everyone the benefits of the cooperative renting horses from the members, and gave the households with horses a detailed account. In this way, the concerns of the households with horses were dispelled, and the members became active. (Tan Jin)

    海龙县红光农业生产合作社
    把牲口折价入社制改为私有租用的办法
    辽东省海龙县西太平村红光农业生产合作社是今年春天成立的。全社二十五户，有四户有马，这些马都作价入社了。这个社向政府借了一部分贷款，加上今年应归还的马价，就担负了很多债务；大部分无马户都担心秋后收入减少，因而情绪不安。中共海龙县委为解决这个问题，号召该社把车马作价入社的办法改为由社租用的办法，藉以减轻债务，使社员安心生产。
    四月三日，该社召开社员大会，讨论这个问题。海龙县刘县长参加了这个会。无马户在会上发言，都很同意租用马匹的办法；有马户却意见纷纷，有的说：“粪都快送完了，眼看要种地啦，又来改变，我不干，还是卖给社里好。”有的说：“那就算啦，还变什么，我那马就算给你们白使吧，租子也不要，保险费也不纳。”两方面最后竟吵起来了。刘县长心里想：有马户为什么不同意改变办法呢？这中间一定有很多问题。他决定先好好了解群众的思想情况，再讨论这个问题。
    第二天，因为这个问题没有解决，社员们都不愿意参加生产。全社二十七个男劳力，只有社主任董殿卿（中共支部书记）领着李耀廷（青年团员）起粪，别的社员都不干活。有马户都在家里生闷气。刘县长去和他们进行个别谈话，经过了再三动员，有马户才说出了心里的话。韩万禄说：“这样一变，那马不如干脆给社白使了。保险费一年十来万，还有代耕粮；得一石几斗租子，去了保险费还有啥啦？”王国滋说：“咱的马租给人家，不是公有的，要不好好喂怎么办？人都有自私心，三天两头还不得吵架闹饥荒呵！若是把我的马喂瘦了算谁的？把马眼打瞎了怎么办？”刘县长听了这些意见，又去和支部书记研究建社的情形，这就把问题弄清楚了。原来在开始组社时，有马户本来舍不得把马入社。但他们看到许多社都实行了车马入社的办法，便认为车马早晚得入社，晚入不如早入，还落个“进步”的好名。社成立后，许多制度还不健全，社员对公共财产还不很爱护。现在把马从公有变为私有，他们一时看不到这里边的好处，但是想到了饲养、使用、保险费、代耕粮、医药费、马下崽子如何休息等一连串的问题。现在只有首先解决这些具体问题，才能打通社员思想，使有马户无马户都不吃亏，团结起来进行生产。
    刘县长和董主任于是召开了社内干部和积极分子会议，让大家了解这种情况，并初步检查了社内过去制度不健全、劳动纪律松弛等问题，又研究出解决这些问题的办法。接着召开了社员大会，经过社员们反复讨论，把所有问题都合理地解决了。有马户最怕喂不好马，大家就选出老韩头专门负责喂马；他心眼正，能起夜，又喂得好。农忙时该给牲口吃多少草料，使牲口保住膘，也作了具体保证。关于有马户嫌租价低的问题，大家一致认为：社内有马户少，马的负担也重，租价应当比往常年的高一些。这样，有马户自出保险费、代耕粮等问题都迎刃而解了。关于马的医药费问题，大家一致认为：牲口给社干活累病了，应当由社医治；如果是宿疾老病，应酌情由马主负担。马下崽子前后的休息时间也规定了。在社员大会上，刘县长又根据社内家底穷、负担大等具体情况，向大家讲清由社租用马匹的好处，并给有马户算了细账。这样，有马户的顾虑解除了，社员们都积极起来了。（谈今）
