Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch: According to TASS, the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting in Vienna on the 20th to discuss preparations for the Third World Trade Union Congress.

    World Federation of Trade Unions Secretary-General Louis Saillant delivered a report at the meeting. He said: The Third World Trade Union Congress will strengthen the activities of workers to defend their vital interests and will strengthen the struggle for peace. In the preparation of the congress, attention must be paid to strengthening trade union organizations, and trade union organizations should be established in various economically underdeveloped countries. National trade union centers should more actively recruit unorganized workers into the ranks. Existing trade union organizations should be strengthened, and new organizations should be established. Everything possible should be done to further consolidate the unity of the working class and to unswervingly expose the rebellious acts of the splitters of trade union leaders. The future congress should be a truly world-scale meeting. That is to say: trade unions from all countries in the world, whether they belong to the World Federation of Trade Unions or not, should participate in this congress, and representatives of working people belonging to any group and any industry can speak on the platform of the congress.

    The Executive Bureau meeting adopted a letter to the working people of the world, which stated: The new peace proposals of the Chinese and Korean governments have laid the foundation for stopping the Korean War and peacefully resolving the entire Korean issue. Not only the parents of the soldiers fighting in Korea, but also hundreds of thousands of honest people around the world, hope to stop the bloodshed in Korea and sincerely hope that the resumption of armistice negotiations will stop the war, thereby strengthening peace and strengthening the security of the people of the Far East and the world. The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on the working people of the world to take joint action to immediately cease fire in Korea and make the armistice negotiations a complete success.

    号召各国劳动人民争取朝鲜停战
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社讯：世界工会联合会执行局于二十日在维也纳举行会议，讨论筹备世界工会第三次代表大会问题。
    世界工联总书记路易·赛扬在会上作报告。他说：世界工会第三次代表大会将加强工人们保卫他们切身利益的活动，并将加强争取和平的斗争。在大会的筹备工作中，必须注意加强工会组织，在各经济落后国家中应建立工会组织。各国工会中心应更加积极地把没有组织的工人吸收到队伍中来。现有的工会组织要加强，并且要建立新的组织。应该尽一切可能进一步巩固工人阶级的团结，并且坚持不懈地揭发分裂派工会领袖们的叛逆行为。要使未来的大会成为真正世界规模的会议。这就是说：全世界各国的工会，不管它们是否属于世界工联，都应参加这次大会，属于任何团体和任何行业的劳动人民的代表都可以在大会的讲台上发言。
    执行局会议通过了告世界劳动人民书，它说：中国和朝鲜政府新的和平建议已为停止朝鲜战争及和平解决整个朝鲜问题奠定了基础。不仅在朝鲜作战的士兵们的父母，而且全世界成千成万的正直的人都希望停止朝鲜的流血，真诚地盼望停战谈判的恢复将能使战争停止，从而加强和平及加强远东和全世界人民的安全。世界工会联合会号召全世界的劳动人民采取共同行动，使朝鲜立刻停火，并使停战谈判完满成功。
