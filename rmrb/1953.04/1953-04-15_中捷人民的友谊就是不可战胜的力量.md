The Friendship Between the Chinese and Czech People is an Invincible Force
茅盾

The Czechoslovak Film Week, from April 15th to 24th, will be held in twenty major cities across the country; this is of great significance for strengthening the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia.

The People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic are brotherly nations. The profound meaning of this intimate term is reflected in the fact that the people of both our countries have glorious traditions of long-term revolutionary struggle. We both achieved final victory in long and arduous struggles thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, thereby establishing people's democratic regimes led by the working class and the Communist Party, and building our new and happy lives according to the example of the great Soviet Union. The people of both our countries resolutely support the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. We are both members of this great camp, and we are defending world peace with concrete actions.

Precisely because our two countries share such consistency in revolutionary tradition, the nature of our regimes, and our political ideals and goals, we are very close in thought and feeling, even though we are geographically far apart. When the working people of China are cultivating in the fields or operating machines, they will think of the millions upon millions of people like themselves in the distant West, in lands they have never been to, working selflessly for the same noble ideals – how excited and happy they will be when they think of this! It is precisely because of this closeness in thought and feeling that the Chinese working people are so eagerly looking forward to seeing how these brothers in the distant West are living happily, working diligently, and how they are developing the creativity of the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party and victoriously building their happy lives.

This Czechoslovak Film Week, I believe, can satisfy this ardent desire of our people. I believe that through this film week, the Chinese people's understanding and fraternal friendship with the Czechoslovak people will not only be rational but also emotional. More importantly, the patriotism and lofty internationalist spirit of the Czechoslovak people, expressed through highly ideological and artistic films, will deeply inspire and educate the Chinese people.

The film week will screen a total of eight films, which not only show the heroic fighting traditions of the Czechoslovak people, but also the various difficulties encountered and overcome by the Czechoslovak people in the process of building socialism, as well as how they resolutely and bravely smashed the various conspiracies and sabotage of class enemies and marched forward victoriously. All of this has great educational significance and inspirational effect for us Chinese people.

We have achieved great success in socialist construction by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; because of the success of socialist construction, the people's lives are getting better and better every day, and the strength of the country is getting stronger and stronger – this is the road that the Czechoslovak people are taking, as we see in the films, and this is the road that the Chinese people are taking today!

There is no doubt that all of this educational significance for the Chinese people cannot but play a significant role in strengthening the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Czech people in defending world peace and building their own motherlands! Our friendship is an invincible force!

    中捷人民的友谊就是不可战胜的力量
    茅盾
    捷克斯洛伐克电影周从四月十五日到二十四日，在全国二十个大城市举行；这对于加强中捷两国人民兄弟般的友谊，是有巨大的意义的。
    中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国是兄弟之邦，这一亲切的称呼之深厚的内容，表现在：我们两国人民都有长期的革命斗争的光荣传统，我们都在长期艰苦斗争中由于有了共产党的领导而获得最后的胜利，从而建立了工人阶级和共产党领导的人民民主的政权，并按照着伟大的苏联的榜样建设自己的新的幸福生活；我们两国人民都是坚决地拥护以苏联为首的世界和平、民主阵营，我们都是这伟大阵营内的成员，而且是用具体的行动来保卫着世界和平的。
    正因为我们两个国家具有这样的革命传统的、政权性质的、政治理想和努力目标的一致性，所以从地理上说来，虽然我们相距遥远，但在思想和感情上，我们是非常亲近的。中国的劳动人民，当他们在田野里耕种，或在机器旁操作的时候，会想到在遥远的西方，自己从没到过的国土上，有千千万万和自己同样的人为了同样的崇高的理想而忘我地工作着，——一想到这些的时候，会多么兴奋而愉快呵！也正因为这种思想感情上的亲近，中国劳动人民又是多么热烈地盼望看到这些远在西方的兄弟们是怎样地在愉快地生活，勤劳地工作，怎样地在共产党领导之下发挥工人阶级的创造力，胜利地在建设他们的幸福的生活。
    这一次的捷克斯洛伐克电影周，相信可以满足我国人民的这种热烈的要求。我相信，通过这次电影周，中国人民对于捷克斯洛伐克人民的认识和兄弟般的友谊，将不但是理性的，而又是感性的，尤其重要的是，通过高度思想性和艺术性的影片而表现出来的捷克斯洛伐克人民的爱国主义的热忱和崇高的国际主义的精神，将深深地鼓舞了并教育了中国人民。
    这次的电影周所放映的片子共计八部，内容既表现了捷克斯洛伐克人民英勇的斗争传统，也表现了捷克斯洛伐克人民在建设社会主义过程中所遭遇并克服了的种种困难，也表现了如何坚决勇敢地粉碎了阶级敌人的各种阴谋破坏而胜利地向前迈进。这一切，对于我们中国人民都具有巨大的教育意义和鼓舞作用。
    由于学习了苏联的先进经验而在社会主义的建设上获得了巨大成就；由于社会主义建设的成功，而人民的生活一天一天更加美好起来，国家的力量更加强大起来，——这就是我们在影片中所看到的捷克斯洛伐克人民所走着的道路，这一条路也正是中国人民今天在走着的！
    毫无疑问，所有这一切的对于中国人民的教育意义，不能不对于中捷两国人民的兄弟般的友谊的加强，起着重大的作用。
    在保卫世界和平与建设自己的祖国中间的中捷人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！我们的友谊就是不可战胜的力量！
