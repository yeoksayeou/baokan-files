    Formulating Advanced Production Plans Should Be Combined with the Struggle Against Bureaucracy

    In the process of inspecting and discussing this year's production plans, state-owned factories and mines in Fushun City discovered that the originally planned levels of most factories and mines were about 20% lower than what could actually be achieved. This serious phenomenon not only exists in Fushun, but is also widespread in other places. Currently, the biggest problem in the plans of state-owned production factories and mines is that many factories and mines often underestimate equipment capacity, labor efficiency, and recovery rates when formulating plans, and overestimate the consumption quotas for power and materials. They only consider the negative factors and weak links affecting production, and do not consider or seldom consider how to promote and improve the positive factors and favorable conditions of production. Therefore, the production plan lags behind the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and lags behind reality.

    The reasons for this phenomenon, in addition to the fact that some leading cadres of factories and mines are not familiar with the production situation and have conservative ideas and local viewpoints, are also due to the fact that they do not conduct investigations and research when formulating plans, do not understand the average advanced quotas that have actually been formed, fail to grasp the key links, and are ignorant of the ideological activities of the workers. These are precisely the manifestations of bureaucratic work style, and precisely a tendency that we must currently oppose.

    However, some state-owned factories and mining enterprises now separate the struggle against bureaucracy from the central work in the factories and mines, and the spearhead of the struggle deviates from the most important and essential shortcomings and errors in the factories and mines, and from the central task of the enterprise – formulating advanced production plans and ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of this plan. This approach is incorrect. In order to closely integrate the struggle against bureaucracy with the current central work, in production factories and mines, when mobilizing the masses to discuss the production plans of their own factory, workshop, and work section, the conservative thinking in leadership should be exposed and criticized, and bureaucratic work styles such as not understanding the production situation, formulating plans behind closed doors, not investigating and researching advanced quotas, accommodating backward plans, underestimating the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, not understanding the ideological situation of workers, and being satisfied with general political work should be exposed and corrected. Then, on this basis, under leadership, the various main quotas of the enterprise should be revised, effective advanced experiences should be affirmed and systematically promoted, technical and organizational measures should be taken to overcome the weak links of the whole factory, and workshop plans and team plans should be drawn up to ensure the completion or overfulfillment of the state tasks by the masses, so as to improve plan management.

### 制订先进的生产计划要和反官僚主义斗争相结合

    制订先进的生产计划要和反官僚主义斗争相结合
    抚顺市国营厂矿在检查、讨论今年的生产计划当中，发现一般厂矿原订计划均较实际可能达到的水平低百分之二十左右。这一严重的现象，不仅在抚顺存在，在其他地方也普遍存在。当前国营生产厂矿计划中最大的问题，是许多厂矿在编制计划时常常过低地计算设备能力、劳动效率和回收率，过高地计算动力、材料消耗定额；只考虑影响生产的消极因素和薄弱环节，不考虑或少考虑如何发扬提高生产的积极因素和有利条件。因此，生产计划就落后于群众的积极性和创造性，落后于实际。
    造成这种现象的原因，除了由于某些厂矿的领导干部不熟悉生产的情况，存在着保守思想和局部观点以外；还由于他们在制订计划时不调查研究，不了解实际上已经形成的平均先进定额，抓不住主要环节，对职工群众的思想活动盲无所知。这一些，正是官僚主义作风的表现，正是我们当前必须反对的一种倾向。
    但是，现在有一些国营厂矿企业，他们把反官僚主义斗争和当前厂矿中的中心工作割裂开来，斗争的锋芒离开了厂矿中最主要的和本质的缺点、错误，离开了企业的中心工作——制订先进的生产计划和保证完成和超额完成这个计划。这种做法是不对的。为了使反官僚主义斗争密切结合当前的中心工作，在生产厂矿中，应该在发动群众讨论本厂、本车间、本工段的生产计划时，揭发和批判领导上的保守思想，暴露和纠正那种不了解生产情况，闭门编制计划、不调查研究先进定额、迁就落后计划，以及过低估计群众的积极性和创造性、不了解职工思想情况、满足于一般化地进行政治工作的官僚主义作风；然后，在这样的基础上，有领导地订正本企业的各种主要定额，肯定和有计划地推广有效的先进经验，采取技术上组织上的措施以克服全厂的薄弱环节，订出群众保证完成或超额完成国家任务的车间计划及班组计划，以改进计划管理。
