    Mr. Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, issued a statement on March 30, 1953, regarding the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war and the resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue to achieve a Korean armistice agreement. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea hereby issues the following statement:

    The aforementioned statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China was made based on the common and consistent views of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Government of the People's Republic of China. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fully agrees with the analysis of the political situation in this statement and the specific conclusions and suggestions put forward in this statement, not only fully supporting the statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China, but also considering this statement a fair statement aimed at ending the Korean War.

    In the process of negotiations between the two sides in Kaesong and Panmunjom, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has consistently adhered to its policy of maintaining and consolidating peace, and has made every effort to reach an agreement on ending the war as quickly as possible.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea hopes to quickly stop the future bloodshed, and in order to adapt to the recommendations in the aforementioned statement of Mr. Zhou Enlai, has prepared the following measures: To take new measures that will not only smoothly resolve the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war but also smoothly resolve the repatriation issue of all prisoners of war, which remains the only obstacle to reaching an armistice agreement, that is, to guarantee the repatriation of all prisoners of war who insist on repatriation, and to hand over the remaining prisoners of war to neutral countries, guaranteeing a fair resolution to their repatriation issue, in order to reach a ceasefire agreement to end the Korean War.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea insists on a policy of peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and is convinced that on the basis of taking this new measure regarding the issue of repatriating prisoners of war, it will contribute to the rapid cessation of the Korean War, which is desired by peace-loving people all over the world. We believe that if the United Nations Command truly desires peace, it should accept our fair proposal.

    【新华社平壤三十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成元帅在三月三十一日发表声明，全文如下：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来先生，在一九五三年三月三十日发表了关于交换病伤战俘问题和解决全部战俘问题以达成朝鲜停战协定的声明。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府特就此发表如下声明：
    上述中华人民共和国政府的声明，是根据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府的共同一致的意见作成的。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，完全同意这个声明中的对于政治形势的分析和这个声明所提出的各项具体结论及建议。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府不但完全支持中华人民共和国政府的声明，并且认为这个声明是以停止朝鲜战争为目的的公正的声明。
    在开城和板门店的双方之间的谈判过程中，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府始终不渝地按照自己的维护并巩固和平的政策，为了尽可能迅速达成关于停止战争的协议，而作了一切努力。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府希望迅速停止今后的流血，为适应上述周恩来先生的声明中的各项建议，已对下列各项措施作好了准备，即：采取不但为顺利解决交换病伤战俘的问题而且为顺利解决至今剩下的成为达成停战协定的唯一障碍的全部战俘的遣返问题的新措施，即保证遣返一切坚持遣返的战俘，把其余的战俘移交给中立国，保证公平解决对他们的遣返问题，以便达成停止朝鲜战争的停战协议。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府坚持和平解决朝鲜问题的政策，并确信在采取这个关于遣返战俘问题的新措施的基础上，对全世界爱好和平人民所渴望的朝鲜战争的迅速停止，将有贡献。我们认为，联合国军方面如果真正愿望和平的话，那么就应当接受我们的公正的建议。
