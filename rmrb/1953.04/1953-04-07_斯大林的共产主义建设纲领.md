    Stalin's Program for Communist Construction
    Soviet Union P. Yudin
    Lenin and Stalin's world-historical achievement lies in their creation of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a party that undertook the enormous task of educating the working class and peasantry with Marxist-Leninist thought, and mobilized the masses to engage in selfless struggle to achieve the revolutionary transformation of society.
    Never in history has there been a party like ours, whose ideological influence can extend to such a vast mass of people, transforming them into a politically educated force, understanding the aims of their struggle and actively striving to achieve those aims.
    Never in history has there been a precedent where a mass party, united in thought and organization, could reach such a degree as our Communist Party founded by Lenin and Stalin.
    Comrade Stalin developed Marxist-Leninist theory, elevating the party's ideological weapon, which bravely opened new historical paths, to an unprecedented height.
    J.V. Stalin summarized the great experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and created a complete doctrine on socialist society. He enriched the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, developing Lenin's idea of the decisive role of the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the proletariat in the struggle for socialism.
    Comrade Stalin developed Lenin's ideas on the economic policy of the dictatorship of the proletariat, formulated the principles of national industrialization, and created the theory of agricultural collectivization. Comrade Stalin pointed out the ways to eliminate the exploiting classes. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people completely eradicated capitalist elements in urban and rural areas, eliminated the exploitation of man by man, and for the first time in history built a socialist society. With their great achievements, the Soviet people turned the socialism dreamed of by humanity's advanced wisdom for centuries into a reality in a country of 200 million people. The victory of Soviet socialism is the greatest victory of the Leninist-Stalinist doctrine of socialism, and the victory of Stalin's leadership.
    Marxism-Leninism teaches that the development of communism will have two stages: the first stage is socialism, and the second and higher stage is communism, and socialism will gradually develop into communism.
    Comrade Stalin brilliantly argued the path from socialism to communism and specifically defined the most important characteristics of communist society. Comrade Stalin's doctrine on the transition from socialism to communism is a new chapter in Marxist-Leninist science.
    J.V. Stalin proved that the development from socialism to communism is an objective, natural, and historical process. Comrade Stalin answered some of the questions raised in the historical development of socialism in his classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." After a meticulous and comprehensive analysis of the economic conditions of socialist society, Comrade Stalin revealed the objective economic laws of the transition from socialism to communism.
    After revealing and formulating the basic economic law of socialism, J.V. Stalin pointed out that the effect of this law determines all the main aspects and main processes of the development of socialist society, determining the historical inevitability of the victory of communism.
    Socialism is gradually developing towards communism. The economic laws of socialism are also the economic laws of communist construction.
    J.V. Stalin brilliantly revealed the dialectical regularity of socialist economic development, pointing out that the basic economic law of socialism determines the effect of other economic laws – including the law of planned development of the national economy. J.V. Stalin pointed out: "The law of planned development of the national economy can only produce the desired effect when it has the task to be achieved by the planned development of the national economy. The law of planned development of the national economy itself cannot provide this task. In particular, the planning of the national economy cannot provide this task. This task is contained in the basic economic law of socialism, that is, it is expressed in the above-mentioned requirements of this law..."
    Comrade Stalin scientifically argued the Communist Party's policy in the process of transitioning from socialism to communism, pointing out that this policy is based on the recognized economic laws of socialism, which operate objectively regardless of people's will.
    J.V. Stalin shattered the vulgar subjectivist view that people can create, change, and transform economic laws themselves. He also shattered another, equally dangerous view that people seem powerless in the face of objective social laws. If the subjectivist view leads to adventurism in economic activity, then the idolization of objective laws will lead to passivity and despair.
    Comrade Stalin taught that people are not powerless in the face of the laws of society. People can recognize these laws, master them, and manage them and fully develop the national economy prudently according to these laws. Therefore, people's activities based on recognized objective laws demonstrate the true power of people to consciously manage social and economic development.
    This power of consciously managing economic development has been brilliantly confirmed by the Communist Party. Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Party has realized magnificent economic transformations, which have transformed our country from an economically backward country into a powerful socialist country, and is now successfully building communism.
    The economic laws of socialism are not realized mechanically and spontaneously, but are the result of the conscious mastery of these laws by the builders of communism. Starting from the objective nature of these laws, Comrade Stalin pointed out how to lead economic development in order to prepare the material production base and cultural conditions for the transition to communism.
    J.V. Stalin taught that in order to actually make the transition to communism possible, it is first necessary to effectively ensure the continuous growth of all social production and to give priority to the growth of the production of means of production.
    Giving priority to the production of the means of production is a certain and unswerving condition for expanding socialist reproduction and ensuring the establishment of a higher economy - the communist economy. The purpose of effectively ensuring the continuous growth of all social production is to meet the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of the entire society.
    One of the basic preconditions for preparing the transition to communism is to raise collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people by means of a gradual transition that is beneficial to the collective farms and therefore also beneficial to the whole society, and to replace commodity circulation with a system of product exchange.
    The question of the method of transitioning from the two forms of socialist ownership to the single form of ownership of communism is a completely new topic in Marxist science. J.V. Stalin brilliantly depicted the specific path of this transition.
    He pointed out that the existence of two forms of socialist ownership determines that commodity-monetary relations must be retained. However, the existence of commodity circulation is incompatible with the prospect of transitioning to communism. Therefore, replacing commodity circulation with a system of product exchange is one of the basic prerequisites for transitioning to communism. Comrade Stalin pointed out that we should grasp the link to prepare for the transition to communism along this route. Under the current conditions in our country, this decisive link is the development of product exchange between industry and agriculture, the seeds of which already exist in the practice of our economy in the form of "barter" between industrial and agricultural products.
    Comrade Stalin gave Marxist solutions to questions such as the method of raising collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people, the complete elimination of the difference between the working class and the peasantry, the elimination of the essential difference between urban and rural areas, and the transition to a classless communist society.
    J.V. Stalin studied the question of the preparatory conditions for the transition to communism not only from the point of view of the development of productive forces and production relations, but also from the point of view of creating cultural prerequisites. The higher the cultural level of society, the more productive people's labor is, and the more smoothly productive forces will develop. Comrade Stalin pointed out that under the communist system, everyone will be cultured and educated. He proved that the improvement of the culture of the entire society is the most important condition for preparing for the transition to communism. Comrade Stalin taught that society must reach such a high level of cultural development that it "ensures the all-round development of the physical and mental abilities of all members of society, so that members of society can receive an education sufficient to become active activists in social development, and can freely choose their professions without being bound to a certain profession for life due to the existing division of labor."
    These principles are the program of social and cultural transformation.
    In order to enable people to become comprehensively educated, and to enable the entire society to achieve a tremendous cultural upsurge, major changes must be made to the existing labor conditions. To do this, it is first necessary to shorten the daily working hours to at least six hours, and then to five hours. Secondly, it is also necessary to implement universal comprehensive technical education, fundamentally improve housing conditions, and increase the real wages of workers and staff by at least double, perhaps even more.
    All of this will lead to the elimination of the essential difference between mental and physical labor.
    Never before in Marxist science have such magnificent tasks of social and cultural transformation been put forward as those put forward by Comrade Stalin.
    J.V. Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is the greatest work of Stalin's genius and a programmatic document of communism. This work succinctly and extremely precisely summarizes the achievements of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and points out the path to realizing the great goal of transitioning to communism.
    Now, communism has become the practical cause of millions of Soviet people. The Soviet people are building a magnificent communist edifice with their daily labor.
    Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" points out the clear path we should take to realize the immortal ideas of Lenin and Stalin.
    J.V. Stalin, the brilliant communist architect, left our people a science for building communism and a party cultivated by him. The leadership of our party and government is in the trustworthy hands of the comrades-in-arms of the great Stalin, who, together with Stalin, led the historic cause of socialist construction. Therefore, when the Soviet people bid farewell to their great teacher and leader Comrade Stalin, they looked to the future with full confidence, knowing that the banner of Lenin and Stalin is in the hands of loyal and tested followers of Lenin and Stalin. The leaders of the Party and government cultivated by Stalin are implementing Stalin's behests, leading the Soviet people through the correct and shortest historical path towards the great goal - communism.

    斯大林的共产主义建设纲领
    苏联  普·尤金
    列宁和斯大林的具有全世界历史意义的功勋就在于他们缔造了伟大的苏联共产党，这个党展开以马克思列宁主义思想教育工人阶级和农民的巨大工作，发动人民群众进行忘我的斗争以争取社会的革命性改造。
    历史上还从未有过像我们党这样的政党，它的思想影响能普及于这样广大的人民群众，能够把他们变成一支有政治教养的队伍，理解自己斗争的目的并为达成这些目的而积极斗争。
    历史上还从未有过先例：一个群众性的政党在思想武装和组织上的团结一致，能够达到这样的程度，像列宁和斯大林所创立的我们的共产党一样。
    斯大林同志发展了马克思列宁主义理论，把勇敢地开辟新历史道路的党的思想武装，提到前所未有的高度。
    约·维·斯大林总结了苏联建设社会主义的伟大经验，创造了关于社会主义社会的完整学说。他丰富了马克思列宁主义的无产阶级专政理论，发展了列宁关于在争取社会主义斗争中工农联盟在无产阶级领导下所起的决定性作用的思想。
    斯大林同志发展了列宁关于无产阶级专政的经济政策思想，制定了有关国家工业化的原理，创立了农业集体化的理论。斯大林同志曾指出消灭剥削阶级的途径。苏联人民在共产党领导下，彻底根除了城乡资本主义因素，消灭了人对人的剥削，在历史上第一次建设了社会主义社会。苏联人民以他们的丰功伟绩把人类先进智慧数世纪以来所梦想的社会主义变成了在一个两亿人口国家中的现实。苏联社会主义的胜利是列宁斯大林关于社会主义学说的最伟大胜利，是斯大林的领导的胜利。
    马克思列宁主义教导说，共产主义的发展将有两个阶段：第一个阶段是社会主义，第二个高级的阶段是共产主义，社会主义将逐渐地发展到共产主义。
    斯大林同志天才地论证了从社会主义过渡到共产主义的道路，并且具体地确定了共产主义社会最重要的特征。斯大林同志所创立的关于从社会主义过渡到共产主义的学说，是马克思列宁主义科学中新的一章。
    约·维·斯大林证明，从社会主义发展到共产主义是客观的自然的历史过程。斯大林同志在他的经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中解答了在社会主义的历史发展过程中所提出的一些问题。斯大林同志在缜密和全面地分析了社会主义社会的经济条件后，揭示了从社会主义过渡到共产主义的客观经济法则。
    约·维·斯大林在揭示和表述了社会主义的基本经济法则以后，指出这一法则的作用决定着社会主义社会发展的一切主要方面和一切主要过程，确定共产主义胜利的历史必然性。
    社会主义正在逐渐地向共产主义发展。社会主义的经济法则同时也是共产主义建设的经济法则。
    约·维·斯大林天才地揭示了社会主义经济发展的辩证的规律性，指出了社会主义的基本经济法则决定着其他经济法则——其中包括国民经济有计划发展的法则——的作用。约·维·斯大林指出：“国民经济有计划发展的法则，只是在具有国民经济的计划发展所要实现的任务时，才能产生应有的效果。国民经济有计划发展的法则本身并不能提供这个任务。国民经济计划化尤其不能提供这个任务。这个任务是包含在社会主义的基本经济法则中，即表现于这一法则的上述要求内……”
    斯大林同志科学地论证了共产党在从社会主义过渡到共产主义的过程中的政策，指出这种政策是以被认识了的社会主义经济法则为基础，这种法则不以人们的意志为转移而客观地发生作用。
    约·维·斯大林粉碎了庸俗的主观主义的观点，这种观点认为，人们自己可以创造、变更和改造经济法则。他也击破了另外的、具有同样危险的观点，这种观点认为，似乎人们在客观的社会法则面前是无能为力的。如果主观主义的观点会导致经济活动中的冒险主义，那么把客观法则偶像化便会导致消极和绝望。
    斯大林同志教导说：人们在社会的法则面前并不是无能为力的。人们能认识这些法则，掌握它们，能驾驭它们并按照这些法则熟谙事理地来全力发展国民经济。因此，人们基于被认识了的客观法则的活动，显示出自觉地管理社会经济发展的人的真正力量。
    这种自觉地管理经济发展的力量，已由共产党所辉煌地加以证实。党在斯大林同志的领导下，实现了宏伟的经济改造，这就使我国从一个经济上落后的国家变成了一个强大的社会主义国家，现在正顺利地建设着共产主义。
    社会主义的经济法则并不是机械地、自发地实现的，而是共产主义建设者们自觉地掌握这些法则的结果。斯大林同志从这些法则的客观性质出发，指出为了准备向共产主义过渡的物质生产基础和文化条件，应当如何领导经济的发展。
    约·维·斯大林教导说，为了在实际上使过渡到共产主义成为可能，首先就必须切实保证全部社会生产的不断增长，并使生产资料生产的增长占优先地位。
    使生产资料的生产占优先地位，是扩大社会主义再生产的一定不移的条件，并保证高级的经济——共产主义经济的建立。切实保证全部社会生产的不断增长的目的，是在于满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化需要。
    准备过渡到共产主义的基本先决条件之一，是用实行起来有利于集体农庄因而也有利于整个社会的逐渐过渡的办法，来把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，并用产品交换制来代替商品流通。
    关于从社会主义的两种所有制形式向共产主义的单一的所有制过渡的方法问题，是马克思主义科学中一个完全崭新的课题。约·维·斯大林天才地描绘了这一过渡的具体道路。
    他指出社会主义的两种所有制形式的存在，决定着必须保留商品——货币的关系。但是商品流通的存在是同向共产主义过渡的远景不相容的。因此，用产品交换制来代替商品流通是向共产主义过渡的基本前提之一。斯大林同志曾指出，应当抓住为了沿着这条路线准备向共产主义过渡的那个环节。在我国目前的条件下，这个决定性的环节便是发展工业和农业之间的产品交换，这种产品交换的萌芽在我国经济的实践中已经以工农业产品之间的“换货”形式而存在。
    关于把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制水平的方法、关于彻底消除工人阶级和农民之间的差别以及消灭城乡之间的本质差别和向无阶级的共产主义社会过渡等问题，斯大林同志都给了马克思主义的解决。
    约·维·斯大林不仅是从生产力和生产关系发展的观点，而且也从创造文化前提的观点，研究了向共产主义过渡的准备条件的问题。社会的文化水平越高，人们的劳动也越具有生产效率，生产力也越会顺利地发展。斯大林同志指出，在共产主义制度下，所有的人都将是有文化的和受过教育的。他证明，整个社会文化的提高，是准备向共产主义过渡的最重要的条件。斯大林同志教导说，必须使社会达到这样高度的文化发展，“保证社会一切成员全面发展他们的体力和智力，使社会成员能获得足以成为社会发展的积极活动家的教育，能自由地选择职业，而不致由于现存的劳动分工而终身束缚于某一种职业。”
    这些原理便是社会文化改造的纲领。
    为了使人们都能成为受全面教育的人，为了使整个社会达到巨大的文化高涨，必须对现存的劳动状况作重大的改变。为了做到这点，首先需要把每天的劳动时间至少缩短到六小时，然后再缩短到五小时。其次，还需要实行普及的综合技术教育，根本改善居住条件和把工人和职员的实际工资至少提高一倍，也许还要更多。
    所有这些都会导致脑力劳动和体力劳动之间本质差别的消灭。
    在马克思主义科学中，还从来没有提出过这样宏伟的社会文化改造的任务，像斯大林同志所提出的一样。
    约·维·斯大林的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”是斯大林的天才的最伟大作品，是共产主义的纲领性文献。这一著作扼要地、极端精确地总结了苏联社会主义建设的成就，指出实现向共产主义过渡的伟大目标的道路。
    现在，共产主义已成为千百万苏维埃人的实践的事业。苏联人民正以自己的日常劳动建设着宏伟的共产主义大厦。
    在斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中，指出了我们所应当走的明确道路，以实现列宁斯大林的不朽思想。
    约·维·斯大林，天才的共产主义建筑师，遗留给我国人民以建设共产主义的科学和一个为他所培育起来的党。我国党和政府的领导掌握在伟大斯大林的战友们的可信赖的手中，他们曾和斯大林一起领导了社会主义建设的历史性事业。因此，苏联人民在和自己的伟大导师和领袖斯大林同志告别的时候，满怀信心地瞻望着未来，他们知道，列宁斯大林的旗帜是握在忠实的、经过考验的列宁和斯大林的信徒的手中。由斯大林所培养的党和政府的领导者们，实现着斯大林的遗训，领导苏联人民通过正确地和最短的历史道路向伟大的目标——共产主义前进。（振亚译自三月九日苏联“真理报”）
