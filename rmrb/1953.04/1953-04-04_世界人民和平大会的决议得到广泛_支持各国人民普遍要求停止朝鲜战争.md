Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 3rd: The "Pravda" published an article by A. Legasov on March 31st, commenting on the peace movement of the people of all countries. He said: The Vienna World People's Peace Congress and its resolutions have been warmly welcomed and widely supported by world opinion. In Italy, more than 2,000 reports were held to convey the achievements of the Vienna Congress. National and local peace rallies were held in Czechoslovakia, Korea, India, Vietnam, Japan, and West Germany to discuss the results of the Vienna Congress. Various mass rallies have been held in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Brazil, China, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Albania. Meetings of various international democratic organizations have discussed the decisions of the World People's Peace Congress.

The decision of the World People's Peace Congress to demand the cessation of the wars now in progress, especially the Korean War, has been wholeheartedly supported everywhere.

With the support of Indian public opinion, "Stop Eisenhower's Action Day" activities were widely carried out throughout India on February 27th. On February 28th, Canada organized "National Day for a Korean Armistice." The Chicago Peace Conference, recently initiated by the American Peace Crusaders, decided to launch a large-scale movement across the United States to demand that the United States Congress immediately call for a ceasefire in Korea. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which has three million members, held a national conference demanding an immediate end to the Korean War.

The movement of the people of all countries to defend national independence and national sovereignty, to oppose being dragged into aggressive blocs, to demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from their territories, and to demand the abolition of foreign military bases has developed to a huge scale. In Germany and its neighboring countries, the struggle against the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties is becoming increasingly fierce. Although the Bonn Federal Parliament has ratified these treaties, it is against the will of the German people. More than 15 million people in West Germany oppose the ratification of the Bonn Treaty; they are an unstoppable force against the warmongers.

In Latin America, the Near East, and Middle Eastern countries, the movement against the organization of aggressive military blocs under the guise of regional conventions is also growing. Prominent Brazilian politicians and military figures have participated in this movement.

The declaration of the World People's Peace Congress calling for negotiations between the five major powers and the conclusion of a peace treaty has been supported by people everywhere. Through the Vienna Congress, the people of all countries have strengthened the struggle for peace. To prevent another massacre, to isolate the warmongers, and to ensure peaceful cooperation among the people of all countries, more and more people, inspired by this noble ideal, are joining the ranks of peace warriors.

    世界人民和平大会的决议得到广泛
    支持各国人民普遍要求停止朝鲜战争
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”在三月三十一日刊载阿·列加索夫的文章，评论各国人民的和平运动。他说：维也纳世界人民和平大会及大会的决议受到世界舆论的衷心欢迎和广泛支持。意大利曾举行了两千多次传达维也纳大会的成就的报告会。捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜、印度、越南、日本、西德都举行了全国性的和地方性的和平集会，讨论维也纳大会的结果。英国、法国、加拿大、芬兰、比利时、丹麦、巴西、中国、波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚等国都举行了各种群众大会。各国际民主组织的会议都讨论了世界人民和平大会的决定。
    世界人民和平大会要求停止现在正在进行的战争，特别是朝鲜战争的决定，无论在什么地方，都受到衷心的支持。
    在印度舆论界的支持下，印度各地在二月二十七日普遍进行了“制止艾森豪威尔行动日”的活动。二月二十八日，加拿大组织了“全国争取朝鲜停战日”。最近由美国和平十字军所发起的芝加哥和平会议决定在美国全国各地发动一个大规模的运动，向美国国会提出在朝鲜立刻停火的要求。拥有三百万会员的日本工会总评议会举行了全国性会议，要求立刻停止朝鲜战争。
    各国人民保卫民族独立和国家主权、反对被拖入侵略性的集团，要求外国军队撤出他们的国土，要求撤销外国军事基地的运动，已发展到巨大的规模。在德国和它的邻国，反对批准波恩和巴黎条约的斗争越来越激烈了，虽然波恩联邦议院已批准了这些条约，但是这是违反德国人民的意志的。西德有一千五百多万人民反对批准波恩条约，他们是一支无法阻挡的反对战争制造者的力量。
    在拉丁美洲、近东和中东国家，反对在区域性公约的幌子下组织侵略性军事集团的运动也愈来愈高涨了。巴西著名的政治家和军界人士都参加了这个运动。
    世界人民和平大会要求五大国举行谈判并缔结和平公约的宣言到处受到人民的支持。通过维也纳大会，各国人民加强了争取和平的斗争，为了防止另一次大屠杀，为了孤立战争贩子及保证各国人民和平合作，不断地有千千万万人在这种崇高理想的鼓舞之下，加入了和平战士的队伍。
