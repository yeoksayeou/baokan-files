    Hubei Provincial Handicraft Representatives Meeting a Great Success
    [This Newspaper's News] According to the Hubei Daily News: In order to better develop handicraft production, to meet the needs of urban and rural people, and to cooperate with the country's economic construction, the Hubei Provincial People's Government convened a provincial handicraft representatives meeting in January. A total of 347 representatives from across the province attended, including handicraft workers, apprentices, independent producers, and handicraft capitalists. Cadres from various cities and towns related to handicraft work also attended the meeting. The representatives fully expressed their opinions, reflecting various aspects and problems related to handicrafts. The main problems were: many handicraftsmen had a vague understanding of the role and future of handicrafts, believing that handicrafts had no future, and were passive in production and management; some industries did not face the countryside for production; some industries developed blindly, the product quality was not high, and they could not be sold. In addition, some people were eager to organize cooperatives, or simply relied on government support, and some people wanted to transfer their businesses to public ownership. The relationship between master and apprentice was not normal. In many areas, cadres and apprentices regarded independent laborers as capitalists, and the master-apprentice relationship as a labor-capital relationship, which affected masters' unwillingness to take on apprentices, and apprentices' inability to learn techniques. In terms of public-private relations, representatives raised many opinions on issues such as short bank loan terms, complicated procedures, tax collection methods, and processing orders and raw material supply. In addition, some industries had great blindness in development, failing to pay attention to improving product quality, resulting in weak sales. Peng Tianqi, Director of the Hubei Provincial People's Government Labor Bureau, made a report to the representatives based on their opinions, elaborating in detail the People's Government's policies and guidelines for handicrafts. He said: The People's Government's policy on handicrafts is to appropriately support and develop them according to needs and possibilities. To achieve this policy, handicraftsmen should recognize which handicrafts are needed for agricultural production, which are needed for farmers' lives, which are needed for urban people's lives, and which are needed to serve industrial construction, in order to distinguish which should be developed, which should be maintained, and which should be transformed. In terms of handicraft management, it is necessary to: First, encourage small producers to operate independently, improve quality, produce and sell themselves, and overcome the dependence mentality of some handicraftsmen. Second, on the basis of small producers' independent production, they can jointly purchase raw materials, or mutually promote sales, or carry out temporary division of labor and cooperation in the case of batch orders. Third, it is necessary to advocate the organization of small labor partnerships on the principles of democracy, equality, voluntariness, and mutual benefit. In addition, the report also explained that production cooperatives are the road to the development of handicrafts, but at present, due to limited cadre conditions and experience, they should not be organized blindly. All regions can gradually organize them step by step, in a planned way, from low to high, based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit.
    After listening to the report, the representatives enthusiastically launched a discussion. Through the discussion, the understanding was generally improved, and they clearly recognized the development prospects and direction of handicrafts, as well as the People's Government's policies and guidelines for handicrafts, overcoming pessimistic and negative emotions. Many representatives reflected: "This meeting was really good!" They expressed that they would actively produce and operate in accordance with the spirit of this meeting to meet the needs of urban and rural people and serve the country's industrialization. Representatives of independent laborers clearly recognized the government's policies and improved their production enthusiasm. The master representatives who attended the meeting expressed that they would cherish their apprentices, not be conservative, and consider it an honor to teach good skills; in order to teach apprentices good skills, they must be "attentive with their mouths, attentive with their hands, and attentive with their hearts." In order to learn good skills, apprentices proposed to "be at ease, be humble, and have confidence" in order to learn good skills and serve the motherland. Finally, Liu Zihou, Vice Chairman of the Hubei Provincial People's Government, made a concluding report.
    In order to implement the spirit of this meeting, the representatives also discussed and formulated the Hubei Provincial Handicraft Representatives Meeting's agreement on several issues between masters, apprentices, employers, and labor.

    湖北省手工业代表会议开得很好
    【本报讯】据湖北日报讯：湖北省人民政府为了使手工业生产能得到更好的发展，以适应城乡人民的需要，配合国家的经济建设，在一月份召开了全省手工业代表会议。到会代表有全省各地手工业工人、学徒、独立生产者、手工业资本家共三百四十七人。各城镇与手工业工作有关的干部也参加了会议。到会代表充分地发表了自己的意见，反映了和手工业有关的各方面情况和问题，其中主要的问题是：许多手工业者对手工业的作用及前途认识模糊，认为手工业没有搞头，在生产经营上表现消极；有的行业没有面向农村进行生产；有的行业盲目发展，产品质量不高，销不出去。此外，还有些人急于要求组织合作社，或单纯依赖政府扶持，也有些人想把自己的事业转为公营。师徒关系不够正常，不少地区的干部和学徒把独立劳动者当资本家看待，把师徒关系当成劳资关系，影响了师傅不愿带徒弟，学徒学不到技术。在公私关系上，代表们对银行贷款期限短、手续繁，对税收的征收方法，以及加工订货、原料供应等问题，也提出了不少的意见。另外，少数行业在发展上存在着很大的盲目性，没有注意到产品质量的提高，以致销路不旺。湖北省人民政府劳动局彭天琦局长根据代表们的意见，向代表们作了报告，详细地阐述了人民政府对手工业的方针和政策。他说：人民政府对手工业的方针是依据需要和可能，适当地扶持和发展。为了实现这一方针，手工业者应该认清那些手工业为农民生产所需要的，那些为农民生活所需要的，那些为城市人民生活所需要的，那些为工业建设服务所需要的，以辨别那些应该发展，那些应该维持，那些应该转业。手工业经营方面要做到：一、鼓励小生产者独立经营，提高质量，自产自销，克服某些手工业者的依赖思想。二、在小生产者各自独立的生产基础上，可以联合采购原料，或互助推销，或在成批的订货情况下，进行临时性的分工合作。三、提倡在民主、平等、自愿、互利的原则下组织小型的劳动合伙。另外，报告中还说明了生产合作社是手工业发展的道路，但目前限于干部条件及经验不多的情况，不应盲目组织。各地可以有步骤、有计划地基于自愿互利的原则，由低级到高级，逐步地组织起来。
    代表们听了报告后，热烈地展开讨论，通过讨论，认识普遍提高，明确认识到手工业的发展前途及方向，以及人民政府对手工业的方针政策，克服了悲观消极情绪。许多代表反映：“这会开的真好！”表示回去后要按照这次会议的精神，积极生产和经营，为满足城乡人民的需要，为国家工业化而服务。独立劳动者代表明确认识到政府的政策，提高了生产积极性。到会师傅代表表示要爱护学徒，不保守，以教好技术为光荣；为了教好学徒的技术，要“嘴到、手到、心到”。学徒为了学好技术，提出学技术要“安心、虚心、有信心”，以便学好技术，为祖国服务。最后由湖北省人民政府副主席刘子厚作了总结报告。
    为了贯彻这个会议的精神，代表们还讨论并制订了湖北省手工业代表会议关于师徒、雇佣、劳资之间几项问题的协议。
