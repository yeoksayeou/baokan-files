　　The Culture and Art of the Mongolian People's Republic
　　Aoyun, Head of the Art Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic

　　In pre-revolutionary Mongolia, domestic feudal lords and foreign imperialist colonizers held dominant positions. At that time, culture and art were only the private property of a small group of wealthy people and nobles, and only served these people.

　　Under the direct influence of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the glorious Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party headed by Sukhe-Bator and Choibalsan, carried out a liberation struggle, implemented a people's democratic revolution in 1921, overthrew the enslavement of foreign invaders and the regime of feudal lords, and established a people's revolutionary system.

　　Only after ordinary herdsmen and laborers became masters of their own destiny did our country's culture and art have broad prospects for development and prosperity.

　　Now, our country is developing a new culture and art with national forms and socialist content.

　　Our science, art, literature, and publishing industries are all closely connected with the people and serve the interests of the people completely. Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the People's Government, and with the constant and sincere assistance of the Soviet Socialist Power, the most culturally advanced country in the world, the Mongolian people have made tremendous achievements in culture and art during the period of the People's Revolution.

　　In pre-revolutionary Mongolia, only 0.7 percent of the total population was literate. Now we have basically eliminated illiteracy. The Mongolian People's Republic now has hundreds of primary schools, seven-year schools, and middle schools, as well as sixteen specialized schools that train cadres with a secondary education level—teachers, assistant physicians, veterinarians, and art, trade, and industrial workers.

　　One of the greatest achievements of the Mongolian people in the cause of people's education is the establishment of a group of institutions of higher learning. The advanced party cadre school established in Ulaanbaatar in 1941 has, during this period, sent hundreds of leading party and state workers with Marxist-Leninist theoretical cultivation to the country. In addition, there is also a teacher's college. Our largest institution of higher learning is Choibalsan National University, which trains experts with higher education for national economic and cultural construction. Choibalsan National University was established in 1942. At that time, the Second World War was in progress, and German fascist bandits and Japanese imperialists were ruthlessly destroying and plundering the cultural heritage of mankind for thousands of years.

　　The Soviet Union, which was rescuing mankind from the fascist barbarians, although in difficult conditions of war, still helped our country in many ways to establish our national university.

　　The National University has a research department, which specializes in training our scientific workers and university teachers. Many scientific workers of the university are carrying out great scientific work on the most important issues such as history, literature, animal husbandry, and industry. Our ranks of scientists are growing.

　　The distribution network of primary schools, seven-year schools, and middle schools and the number of students are increasing year by year. During the five-year plan from 1947 to 1952, the total number of ordinary schools increased by 101.9 percent. During this period, the number of primary school students increased by 88.4 percent, the number of seven-year school students increased by 33.3 percent, the number of full middle school students increased fourfold, the number of specialized school students increased by 27 percent, and the number of university students increased twofold.

　　In addition to primary schools, seven-year schools, and middle schools, there are also many adult training classes and night schools, from which several thousand workers graduate every year.

　　The Mongolian people have also made tremendous achievements in developing their national art. The old feudal Mongolia did not leave behind even one art institution.

　　The Mongolian people have created various arts in their more than 30 years of free life. Now our country has theaters, literature, film, fine arts, music, acrobatics, and they are all developing; amateur recreational activities are even more widely developed. At present, our country has a National Music and Drama Theater, a Central Children's Theater, a Puppet Theater, many provincial theaters, three song and dance ensembles, 85 cinemas and mobile film projection teams, 20 fine art studios, a film studio, a national acrobatic troupe, some small song and dance performance venues, a writers association, etc.

　　Participants in amateur recreational activities have formed several hundred groups.

　　In the five years from 1947 to 1952, the number of cinemas increased by 125 percent, and the number of mobile film projection teams increased by 100 percent. The number of art creation workers increased by 69 percent, of which those with higher education increased threefold.

　　We have a special drama and music school to train new young art cadres. It trains theater actors, musicians, singers, dancers, artists, sculptors, and acrobats. In addition, in order to improve the political and general education level of art workers, a night research institute for art workers was founded in 1950.

　　Our revolutionary art is a truly people's art loved by the masses of the people. Our art is developed on the road of socialist realism. The main task of our art is to reflect the true situation of our life, to express our advanced figures who are consolidating our country with their creative labor, and to express our people's struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　Our art workers have repeatedly performed their skills in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. Our art representatives participated in the World Youth and Student Festivals held in Prague, Budapest, and Berlin in 1947, 1949, and 1951.

　　Mongolian films such as "Sukhe-Bator," "Mongolian People's Republic," and "Zogto Taiji" have been successfully screened in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries.

　　Meetings with actors and art workers from the Soviet Union, North Korea, China, Romania, and other people's democratic countries have been of no small help in further consolidating the friendship between us and the people of these countries, and in further developing our art. Our acrobats toured Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, and other Soviet cities in 1952, which had a tremendous impact on the development of our acrobatic art.

　　The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the People's Government pay special attention to the development of culture and art. Our art workers receive constant support and care from our dear party, government, and all the people.

　　Budget expenditures for cultural and art facilities are constantly increasing. During the first five-year plan, the state budget spent 486.8 million Tugriks (Mongolian currency) on social and cultural facilities for the development of science, art, and health care. In 1952, the appropriation for these facilities increased by 33.8 percent compared with 1947.

　　Cultural and art workers can also receive our republic's medals and awards for many years of unremitting work, and if they have particularly outstanding achievements, they can receive honorary titles such as honorary teacher, people's actor, honorary actor, or honorary artist. In addition, there is also the Choibalsan Medal.

　　The cultural and art workers of the Mongolian People's Republic are determined to achieve greater success in the work of developing national culture and art under the leadership of their dear party and government, with the help of the Soviet Union, and in the friendly alliance with various people's democratic countries.

　　The art workers of our Mongolian People's Republic are very pleased to come to the friendly People's Republic of China to introduce the achievements of our country's art to Chinese friends, to observe the achievements of the People's Republic of China's culture and art, and to wish the great Chinese people further success in the cause of building their motherland.

　　繁荣幸福的和平民主国家
    蒙古人民共和国的文化和艺术
    蒙古人民共和国艺术团团长  奥云
    在革命前的蒙古，国内封建领主与外国帝国主义殖民者占据着统治地位。当时的文化与艺术只是一小撮富豪与贵族的私人财产，只是为这些人服务的。
    在伟大十月社会主义革命的直接影响下，蒙古人民在以苏赫—巴托尔和乔巴山为首的光荣的蒙古人民革命党领导下进行了解放斗争，在一九二一年实行了人民民主革命，推翻了外国侵略者的奴役和封建领主的政权，建立了人民革命制度。
    只有在普通的牧民与劳动者成了自己命运的主人以后，我国的文化与艺术才有了广阔发展与繁荣的前途。
    现在，我国正在发展着新的、民族形式与社会主义内容的文化和艺术。
    我们的科学、艺术、文学和出版事业都与人民有着最密切的联系，完全是为人民的利益服务的。蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党和人民政府的领导下，在世界上文化最先进的国家苏维埃社会主义强国的经常的真诚的帮助下，在人民革命时期内，在文化艺术上取得了巨大的成就。
    在革命前的蒙古，全体人口只有百分之零点七是识字的，现在我们已经基本上消灭了文盲。蒙古人民共和国现在有几百所小学、七年制学校与中学，有十六所训练中等教育程度的干部——教师、助理医师、兽医与艺术、贸易、工业等工作人员的专科学校。
    蒙古人民在人民教育事业上获得的最大的成就之一，就是建立了一批高等学校。一九四一年在乌兰巴托建立的高级的党的干部学校，在这一段时期内向国家输送了几百个具有马克思列宁主义理论修养的党和国家的领导工作者。此外还有一个教育学院。我国最大的高等学府就是乔巴山国立大学，它为国民经济与文化建设等方面培养着具有高等教育程度的专家。乔巴山国立大学是在一九四二年建立的。当时第二次世界大战正在进行，德国法西斯匪徒和日本帝国主义者正在无情地破坏与劫掠人类千百年来的文化遗产。
    从法西斯野蛮者手中拯救着人类的苏联，虽然处在战争的艰苦条件下，但仍多方面帮助了我国建立我们的国立大学。
    国立大学设有一个研究部，专门培养我国的科学工作者与高等学校教师。该大学的许多科学工作者都对历史、文学、牧畜学、工业等各种最重要的问题进行巨大的科学工作。我们科学家的队伍正在壮大着。
    小学、七年制学校与中学的分布网和学生人数都一年比一年增加。在一九四七——一九五二年的五年计划期间，普通学校的总数增加了百分之一百零一点九。在这段时期内，小学学生的数目增加了百分之八十八点四，七年制学校学生的数目增加了百分之三十三点三，完全中学学生数目增加到四倍，专科学校学生数目增加了百分之二十七，大学生数目增加到两倍。
    除了小学、七年制学校与中学之外，还有许多成年人的训练班和夜校，每年有好几千劳动者毕业。
    蒙古人民在发展自己民族艺术方面也获得了巨大的成就。旧的封建的蒙古，连一所艺术机构也没有遗留下来。
    蒙古人民在自己三十多年的自由生活中创立了各种艺术。现在我国已有剧院、文学、电影、造型艺术、音乐、杂技，而且都在发展着；业余文娱活动更有着广泛的发展。现在我国有一个国立音乐戏剧剧院、中央儿童剧院、木偶剧院、许多省的剧院、三个歌舞文工团、八十五个电影院与流动电影队、二十个造型艺术工作室、一个电影制片厂、一个国家杂技团、一些小型的歌舞表演场所、一个作家协会等等。
    参加业余文娱活动者们组成了好几百个小组。
    在一九四七—一九五二年的五年中，电影院的数目增加了百分之一百二十五，流动电影队增加了百分之一百。艺术创作工作者的数目增加了百分之六十九，其中具有高等教育程度者增加到三倍。
    我们有一个专门的戏剧音乐学校，训练新的年青的艺术干部。它培养出戏剧演员、音乐家、歌唱家、舞蹈家、美术家、雕刻家、杂技演员。此外，为了提高艺术工作者的政治与一般教育的水平，在一九五○年创办了一所艺术工作者的夜间研究院。
    我们的革命艺术是人民群众所热爱的真正的人民艺术。我们的艺术是在社会主义现实主义的道路上发展起来的。我们艺术的主要任务，是反映我们生活的真实情况，表现那些正以自己创造性的劳动巩固着我们国家的我国先进人物，表现我们人民为了和平、民主与社会主义而进行的斗争。
    我们的艺术工作者曾经屡次在苏联与各人民民主国家表演了自己的技艺。我们的艺术代表们曾参加了一九四七年、一九四九年与一九五一年在布拉格、布达佩斯与柏林举行的世界青年与学生联欢节。
    蒙古影片“苏赫—巴托尔”、“蒙古人民共和国”、“左格托·泰基”等曾在苏联与各人民民主国家成功地放映过。
    与苏联、朝鲜、中国、罗马尼亚及其他人民民主国家的演员与艺术工作者的会面，对进一步巩固我们和这些国家的人民的友谊，对进一步发展我们的艺术的事业，有了不小的帮助。我们的杂技演员在一九五二年曾到苏联首都莫斯科和苏联其他城市巡回演出，这对我们杂技艺术的发展起了巨大的影响。
    蒙古人民革命党与人民政府特别注意文化与艺术的发展。我们的艺术工作者受到我们亲爱的党、政府与全体人民经常的支持与关怀。
    供文化与艺术设施的预算支出不断地增加着。在第一次五年计划期间，国家预算对发展科学、艺术、保健方面的社会文化设施支出了四亿八千六百八十万元格里克（蒙币）。在一九五二年，为这些设施的拨款，比一九四七年增加百分之三十三点八。
    文化艺术工作者如果作了多年不倦的工作，还可以获得我们共和国的勋章与奖章，如有特别杰出的成绩，则可以获得功勋教师、人民演员、功勋演员或功勋艺术家等光荣称号。此外，还有乔巴山勋章。
    蒙古人民共和国的文化艺术工作者怀有决心，要在自己亲爱的党与政府的领导下，在苏联的帮助下，在与各人民民主国家的友好同盟中，在发展本国文化艺术的工作中获得更大的成绩。
    我们蒙古人民共和国的艺术工作者感到十分欣幸，能来到友好的中华人民共和国，来向中国朋友介绍我国艺术的成就，来观摩中华人民共和国文化艺术的成就，并祝伟大的中国人民在建设自己祖国的事业中获得进一步的成功。
