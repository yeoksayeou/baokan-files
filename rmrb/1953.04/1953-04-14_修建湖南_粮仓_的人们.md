    The People Who Built the "Granary" of Hunan
    Chen Zhi
    Crossing the Yangtze River, from Songzi and Shishou counties in Hubei to Xiangyin, Yuanjiang, and Yiyang counties in Hunan, there is a vast lake area, which is the largest inland lake in our country—Dongting Lake. The land along the lake is fertile and rich in products, and the people of Hunan call it the "granary" and the "land of fish and rice." There was once a song that described the richness of the area along the lake:
    Eight hundred li of Dongting Lake has beautiful scenery, everyone calls it the "granary of rice,"
    The land along the lake is as fertile as oil, yielding two years' harvest in one year,
    Cotton blossoms are all white, men, women, old and young are busy picking flowers,
    Fish in the lake bump heads, ducks walk in rows along the lake,
    The products along the lake are countless, truly a "land of fish and rice" good place.
    Indeed, the area along the lake is a place rich in products. Let's just take the eleven counties along the lake in Hunan: these eleven counties only account for one-tenth of the total cultivated land in the province, but the rice produced accounts for one-sixth of the province's total output, and cotton accounts for more than half of the province's total output. Fishermen along the lake catch hundreds of catties of fish in the lake every day, which is very common.
    Although the area along the lake is so rich, due to the Yangtze River water flowing into Dongting Lake from the four mouths of Songzi, Ouchi, Taiping, and Tiaoxian, the flow rate gradually slows down, and a large amount of sediment carried in the water settles to the bottom of the lake, the lake bed gradually increases in height, and the water storage capacity decreases accordingly, often causing floods. The rulers of the past not only did not manage this disaster, but instead colluded with landlords to arbitrarily build dikes and polders on the silted continent, destroying the Dongting Lake river system. Therefore, every flood season, the Yangtze River water flows into Dongting from the north, and the four rivers of Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li discharge into the lake from the south, flooding everywhere and causing floods. After the floods, the landlords forced rent and seized land from the peasants, and lent money at usurious rates, causing the peasants to lose their families and properties.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people along the lake were given land and repaired the dikes and polders, achieving three consecutive years of good harvests. However, last year, an unprecedented storm occurred, causing some farmers in the South Dongting Lake area to suffer another disaster. Last autumn, in order to eliminate this disaster, the Hunan Provincial People's Government decided to mobilize more than 200,000 migrant workers to complete the renovation project of South Dongting Lake in three months, starting from December 15.
    This project is quite arduous. In addition to repairing the breached dikes and building new levee lines, it is also necessary to adjust the Xiang and Zi rivers, cut off four silted lakes, block thirteen river mouths, and build a modern sluice gate.
    Although the project was arduous, when the farmers in various parts of the lake heard that the government was going to lead them in preventing and eliminating floods, they all volunteered to sign up. Cai Fuli, a farmer in Yiyang, was only ten days away from his wedding date, and his clothes and bedding had been prepared neatly. When he heard that he was going to repair the dikes along the lake, he immediately tried to persuade his mother and decided to repair the dikes first, and then get married. The silt in Huangtu Lake is like slurry, as deep as six or seven feet. In order to make the new embankment base firm, it is necessary to dig out 369 zhang long and more than five zhang wide silt, and fill the new embankment with new soil. The migrant workers then braved the biting north wind, rolled up their trouser legs to their thighs and dug and carried silt. Sixty-three warriors who emerged in the silt removal competition dug and carried more than 300 cubic meters of silt a day, averaging 30,000 catties of silt per person per day.
    On New Year's Eve in 1952, in cities or villages, people may have been sitting around the stove eating tea and fruit, talking about the harvest of the year and planning for the work of the coming year; but the migrant workers on South Dongting Lake were living a new and more pleasant life. In order to greet 1953 with practical actions, the migrant workers in Wangcheng braved the north wind, covered with cold stars, and filled the new embankment base with layers of soil, and then carried a large stone pestle weighing more than 400 catties, beating and singing:
        Comrades, work harder!
        Hey yo!
        Build a big granary!
        Hey yo!
    That's how they spent New Year's Eve.
    Who doesn't love the steel-like dikes newly built by the migrant workers? An old man Sheng, who had lived on the edge of the dike for sixty-four years, had personally watched the polder collapse more than twenty times since the Guangxu years, and had repaired it more than twenty times, but he had never seen a stone pestle. Looking at the growing dike, he said with emotion: "I have lived for sixty-four years, and I have never seen a dike built so firmly!"
    New Year's Day in 1953 came, and the migrant workers slaughtered pigs and happily spent the festival. The migrant workers in Linxiang also sang flower drum operas they wrote themselves, such as "Singing about Lake Management" and "Persuading Husband to Repair Dikes." Really, the migrant workers are not only experts in repairing dikes, but also singers! From the time the migrant workers arrived at the construction site, every day, after the closing bell rang, they would carry their hoes and baskets and hum flower drum operas back.
    The government's care for the migrant workers can be said to be meticulous. Thirteen film projection teams, the Provincial Art Troupe, the Military Region Art Troupe, magic lanterns, and ballad singers toured the construction site or the workers' sheds to perform for the migrant workers. Xinhua Bookstore also sent more than a dozen service personnel to lend them books, and each group had a newspaper. Each kitchen raised pigs and made its own tofu. Once, female Youth League cadres Xiao Rongyi and Luo Xiangrong and eight others took time out of their rest to mend clothes for the migrant workers in the workers' sheds. They mended from six o'clock to eleven o'clock in the evening.
    After New Year's Day, the largest and most dangerous Wangjia River blocking project on South Dongting Lake began. Due to the filling of stones and soil on both sides, the river water rose by three or four feet. Several thousand catties of bamboo cages filled with stones were pushed down at the rushing river, and they were washed away before they could reach the bottom. A large wooden boat of dozens of tons used to block the waves, which was parked in the backwater bay downstream of the blockage, was smashed to pieces by the torrents and collapsing soil in less than a day. People who had participated in the Jingjiang flood diversion said: "This is much more difficult than the Hudu River blocking project!"
    The water was boiling, but the people's hearts were boiling even more. In order to cut off this torrent, the migrant worker Huang Renke had carried 480 loads of soil that day. Everyone else had gone to eat dinner, but he was still working there alone. Li Xiaocun, the deputy captain of the technical team, and Liu Shuqing, the squad leader, had not slept for three days and three nights. Their throats were hoarse and their lips were cracked, but they were still climbing on the wooden pile frame more than three zhang above the river surface to drive wooden piles. They understood that blocking the Wangjia River and the other twelve rivers would not only reduce the interference of the Xiang and Zi rivers and the occurrence of floods, but also shorten the levee line by 250 kilometers and increase the fertile land for the people along the lake by more than 50,000 mu.
    After January 10, the situation of the project became more urgent. Several times, the torrents washed away the newly filled earth dikes, but the migrant workers immediately filled them with stones. In this way, after a fierce battle of more than 10,000 cadres and migrant workers for fifteen days and nights, the torrent was finally cut off at 2 pm on the 16th. But who would have thought that on the 17th, a strong wind suddenly rose, snowflakes flew, and the ground froze into a layer of water. At this time, the strong wind rolled up the torrent and flowed in from the stone crevices, brushing the stone crevices in bursts, and the situation was already very tense again. At this time, only by going to the bottom of the water and filling the stone crevices with grass bags could the torrent be blocked. But it was so cold that a drop of water splashed on a person would hurt like a knife cutting meat. Who could go to the bottom of the water to fill the stone crevices!
    Should the stone dike that more than 10,000 people had worked on for fifteen days and nights collapse? Seeing this situation, Pan Ding'an, a Youth League member who loved the motherland, his heart was boiling. He made up his mind, immediately took off his clothes, and dived into the water more than 27 feet deep with grass bags, skillfully blocking the stone crevices. When he completed the task and swam out of the water, his skin was swollen all over.
    "Are you cold!" Countless people asked with concern.
    "Not cold!"
    "Your body is frozen like this!"
    "For national construction, what is this?"
    As soon as the words were spoken, Yu Junqi, Tan Binghuang, Yi Shuiquan, Yuan Guanbao, Zeng Shengquan, and Xiong Ziyun, members of the water diving team, also took off their clothes one by one and went to the bottom of the water from two zhang to two zhang seven feet deep to fill the stone crevices.
    When the heroes blocked the torrent and the steel-like dam steadily grew taller, people saw this large piece of new enclosed fertile and flat land, and they all smiled and said: What a good piece of land!

### 修建湖南“粮仓”的人们

    修建湖南“粮仓”的人们
    陈植
    跨过长江，从湖北的松滋、石首等县到湖南的湘阴、沅江、益阳等县，有一片广大的湖沼地区，这便是我国内陆最大的湖泊——洞庭湖。滨湖土地肥美，物产丰富，湖南人民都把这里称做“粮仓”和“鱼米之乡”。曾有这样一首歌儿，形容滨湖的富庶：
    八百里洞庭好风光，人人称它“米粮仓”，
    滨湖土地肥如油，一年能打两年粮，
    棉花开花一片白，男女老少摘花忙，
    湖里鱼儿头碰头，湖边鸭子走成行，
    滨湖出产数不尽，真是“鱼米之乡”好地方。
    的确，滨湖地区是一个物产丰富的地方。我们单以湖南滨湖十一县来说：这十一县的耕地只占全省耕地总面积十分之一，但出产的米谷却占全省总产量六分之一，棉花竟占全省总产量半数以上。沿湖渔民，每天在湖里网几百斤鱼儿，那是很平常的事。
    滨湖地区虽然如此富庶，但由于长江流水，从松滋、藕池、太平、调弦四口流入洞庭湖后，流速渐缓，水中夹带的大量泥沙沉淤湖底，湖床逐年增高，容水量随之减少，常常发生水灾。历代的统治者对于这一灾害，不但不加以治理，反而勾结地主，在淤积面的洲土上，任意修筑堤垸，破坏洞庭湖的河道系统。因此，每到汛期，长江的水从北面流入洞庭，湘、资、沅、澧四水又从南面泄注入湖，泛滥四淹，造成水灾。大水过后，地主们向农民逼租夺田，放高利贷，弄得农民倾家荡产。
    解放后，在共产党、人民政府的领导下，滨湖人民分得了土地，又修整了堤垸，获得连续三年的丰收。但去年发生了数十年来未有的大风暴，使南洞庭湖部分农民，又蒙受了一次灾害。去年秋天，湖南省人民政府为了消灭这种灾害，决定动员二十多万民工，自十二月十五日起，以三个月时间，完成南洞庭湖的整修工程。
    这个工程是相当艰巨的，除了修复溃垸和新建堤线外，还要调整湘、资二水，腰斩四个淤泥湖，堵住十三个河口，并建立一座现代化的水闸。
    工程虽然艰巨，但滨湖各地农民一听到政府要领导他们防除水灾，一个个都自愿报名参加。益阳农民蔡福礼距结婚日期只有十来天了，衣服、被料都已准备得整整齐齐，他一听说到滨湖修堤，就立刻想办法说服了他妈妈，决心先修好堤，然后再结婚。黄土湖淤泥如浆，深达六七尺，为了把新堤基修得牢固，必须把三百六十九丈长，五丈多宽的淤泥挖出，用新土填出新堤。民工们于是迎着刺骨的北风，把裤角挽到大腿上挖挑淤泥。在出淤泥竞赛中出现的六十三名勇士，一天挖出和挑出三百多方淤泥，平均每人每天能挖挑淤泥三万斤。
    一九五二年除夕，在城市或乡村里，人们也许正在围着火炉吃着茶果，谈叙着这一年的收获和计划着来年的工作；可是南洞庭湖上的民工们，却过着一种新的、更加愉快的生活。望城的民工们为了以实际行动迎接一九五三年，迎着北风，披着寒星，在新堤基上填了一层土又一层土，然后抬着四百多斤重的大石硪，边打边唱着：
        同志们加油干呵！
        嗬喂哟！
        建设大粮仓呵！
        嗬喂哟！
    他们就这样地度过了除夕之夜。
    谁又不热爱民工们新修起的钢铁般的大堤呢？一个在垸堤边居住了六十四年的盛老伯伯，从光绪年间起，他亲眼看着这个垸子垮了二十多次，又修了二十多次了，但他还从来没见过石硪。他望着一天天成长着的大堤感动地说：“我活了六十四岁了，还没见过修得这样牢固的堤呢！”
    一九五三年元旦来了，民工们杀了猪，愉快地度着节日，临湘民工还演唱了自己编写的“唱治湖”“劝夫修堤”等花鼓戏。真的，民工们不但是修堤的能手，一个个还是演唱家哩！打从民工们到了工地，每天，当收工号响过后，一个个便扛着镢头，箢箕哼着花鼓戏走回来。
    政府对民工们的照顾，真可说是无微不至。十三个电影放映队、省文工团、军区文工团、幻灯、弹词艺人巡回不断地在工地或工棚为民工们演唱。新华书店还派了十几个服务员借书给他们看，每个小组都有一份报纸。每个厨房里养着猪，自己做豆腐。有一次女青年团员干部萧荣益和罗湘荣等八个人，抽出休息时间，到工棚为民工们补衣服。她们从六点多钟一直补到晚上十一点钟。
    元旦过后，南洞庭湖上最大的最艰险的王家河堵口工程开始了。由于两岸填塞石头土块，河水陡涨了三四尺高。河水激流处推下几千斤装着石头的竹笼，落不到底就被冲走了。在堵口下游回水湾停放的一只几十吨的阻浪大木船，不到一天，便被激流和溃下的土块打得粉碎。参加过荆江分洪的人们说：“这比虎渡河堵口工程难多了！”
    水在沸腾，但人心更在沸腾。为了截断这条激流，民工黄仁科这天已经挑了四百八十担土，别人都吃晚饭去了，但他一个人还在那里工作。技术队副队长李晓村、分队长柳树青已经三天三夜不睡觉了，他们的喉咙嘶哑了，嘴唇裂破了，但仍爬在离河面三丈多高的木桩架上打木桩。他们明白堵住了王家河和另外十二条河流，不但可减少湘、资二水的干扰和水灾的发生，而且可以缩短堤线二百五十公里，为滨湖人民增加肥沃土地五万多亩。
    一月十日以后，工程的情况更紧急了。有几次，激流冲陷了新填起的土堤，但民工们立刻又填塞起石块，这样，经过一万多干部和民工十五个昼夜的激烈战斗，终于在十六日下午二时截断了激流。但谁又料到到了十七日，忽然狂风大作，雪花纷飞，地上冻结起水层来。这时狂风卷着激流从石缝里流进来，一阵阵刷大着石缝，情况已经又很紧张了。这时候，只有下到水底用草袋填塞住石缝，才能挡住激流。可是天这么冷，一个水点溅在人身上，还会像刀子割肉一样地痛，谁又能下到水底填塞石缝呢！
    就让一万多人劳动了十五个昼夜的石堤垮了吗？热爱祖国的青年团员潘定安看到这种情形，他的心沸腾了，他下了决心，立刻脱光了衣服，带着草袋钻入两丈七尺多的水底，巧妙地塞住了石缝。当他完成任务凫出水面的时候，浑身皮肤都冻得红肿起来了。
    “很冷吧！”无数的人关心地问。
    “不冷！”
    “身体都冻成这个样子了呵！”
    “为了国家建设，这算么子（什么）。”
    话刚刚说完，氽水组组员余均其、谭丙皇、易水泉、袁官保、曾胜泉、熊梓云六人也一个个脱光衣服下到二丈到二丈七尺深的水底填塞石缝去了。
    当英雄们把激流塞住、钢铁般的水坝稳稳地长高的时候，人们看到这大一片新被围进来的肥油油平坦坦的土地，一个个都笑眯眯地说：真是一片好土地呵！
