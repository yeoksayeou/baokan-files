Xinhua News Agency: The United Nations Secretariat published a letter from Guatemalan Foreign Minister Raúl Osegueda to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on April 1st.

The letter pointed out: "Since the Guatemalan Revolution of 1944, the U.S. press, important newspapers in other countries, and some of the largest news agencies in North America have engaged in a systematic propaganda campaign to spread false and malicious reports."

The letter revealed: Former U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala, Richard Patterson, during his tenure incited various conspiracy groups to carry out subversive activities against the legitimate government of Guatemala. The letter also cited the general manager of the United Fruit Company, a U.S. capital firm, as telling a reporter for "Time Newsreel" that the United Fruit Company intended to request the U.S. State Department to intervene in Guatemala regarding the confiscation of the company's uncultivated land in Guatemala under the Land Reform Law.

Osegueda said that three foreign companies dominating the Guatemalan economy—the United Fruit Company, the International Railways of Central America, and the Guatemalan Electric Company—used monopolistic means to obstruct Guatemala's economic development, hinder social progress, and impede improvements in the living conditions of Guatemalan workers, and attempted to coerce the Guatemalan government through economic pressure.

Osegueda concluded: "The Guatemalan government believes that these facts are a threat to its national dignity, sovereignty, and independence, and believes that someone may attempt to use force to violate these rights. In accordance with the aforementioned principles, the Guatemalan government believes that it has full right to repel any act of aggression or threat of aggression."

    危地马拉政府致函联合国谴责美国干涉内政
    据新华社讯：联合国秘书处发表危地马拉外交部长劳尔·奥塞格达四月一日给联合国秘书长的信。
    这封信指出：“自从一九四四年危地马拉革命以来，美国的各系报纸、其他国家的重要报刊及北美洲最大的一些通讯社进行了有计划的宣传，来散布虚假的与恶意的报道。”
    这封信揭露：前美国驻危地马拉大使理查德·派特逊在任期内曾煽动各种阴谋集团对危地马拉的合法政权进行颠覆活动。信中又举出美国资本的联合果品公司总经理对美国“时代花絮报”记者发表谈话说，联合果品公司想要求美国国务院干涉危地马拉根据土地改革法而没收该公司在危地马拉拥有的荒田问题。
    奥塞格达说：在危地马拉经济中占有统治地位的三家外国公司——联合果品公司、中美国际铁路公司及危地马拉电气公司，用垄断手段阻挠了危地马拉经济的发展，妨碍了社会进步与危地马拉工人生活条件的改善，并想用经济压力来胁迫危地马拉政府。
    奥塞格达最后说：“危地马拉政府认为，这些事实对于它的民族尊严、主权与独立是一种威胁，并认为可能有人企图用武力来侵犯这些权利。按照上述原则，危地马拉政府认为它有充分权利击退任何侵略行动或侵略威胁。”
