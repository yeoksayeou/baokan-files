    Supporting the Polish Proposal to Maintain World Peace
    The proposal made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Poland, Mr. Skrzeszewski, to the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, aimed at preventing the threat of another world war, maintaining peace, and strengthening international security, has begun to be discussed at the United Nations General Assembly. We, the Chinese people, fully support this proposal by the Polish Foreign Minister, believing that it fully conforms to the wishes of the people of the world for peace and is the only correct path to eliminate the threat of another world war and ensure the peaceful lives of people of all countries.
    The Polish proposal first points out that the Korean War must be stopped immediately; all prisoners of war should be repatriated in accordance with international rules; all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, should be withdrawn from Korea within two to three months; and the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully, enabling the Korean people to establish a unified country under the supervision of a commission. This suggestion addresses the most important issue in the current international situation and proposes the fairest and most reasonable solution. This is entirely legitimate. Recently, the Chinese and Korean sides, based on their consistent peaceful stance, have taken significant steps to facilitate smooth negotiations and reach an agreement on the issue of repatriating sick and wounded prisoners of war during the war. The Chinese and Korean sides also advocate that the reasonable resolution of the issue of repatriating sick and wounded prisoners of war should lead to the smooth resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue, thereby promoting the Korean armistice and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Premier Zhou Enlai of China and Premier Kim Il-sung of Korea recently put forward new proposals for resolving the entire prisoner of war issue, demonstrating steps of concession to eliminate the differences between the two sides on this issue, thereby clearing the way for the immediate resumption of negotiations between the delegations of both sides to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue. Now that an agreement has been reached on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war, the immediate resumption of armistice negotiations to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue and achieve an armistice has been put on the agenda. As pointed out in the statement by Premier Zhou Enlai of China on March 30, "With the reasonable resolution of the issue of sick and wounded prisoners of war, as long as both sides genuinely have the sincerity to make mutual concessions to facilitate the Korean armistice, the smooth resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue is entirely possible." Because only by ending the Korean War and signing an armistice agreement can the threat of a new war be eliminated and international peace and security be consolidated. Now, all peace-loving people around the world are encouraged by the significant efforts made by the Chinese and Korean sides for peace, and are concerned about and watching the situation in Panmunjom, to see whether the US government has genuine sincerity in comprehensively resolving the entire prisoner of war issue and the Korean armistice issue.
    The bacteriological warfare waged by the US government in northern Korea and northeastern China must also be effectively stopped immediately. Prominent scientists, democratic legal workers, and public leaders from China and around the world have conducted on-the-spot investigations and obtained numerous conclusive pieces of evidence, and no US government officials or officers have been able to refute any of these pieces of evidence. The confessions of US Air Force personnel who personally spread bacteria over Korea and northeastern China and senior US officers who personally arranged and executed the bacteriological warfare orders of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff further confirmed the fact that the United States was conducting bacteriological warfare, and no US government officials or officers have been able to refute any of these facts or correct any single letter of these confessions. However, the US government is still conducting bacteriological warfare and has established many institutions for researching and manufacturing bacteriological weapons in the United States and Japan, actively preparing to expand bacteriological warfare. The US government is not only conducting bacteriological warfare in northern Korea and northeastern China, but also using Korean-Chinese peace people and Korean-Chinese prisoners of war for bacteriological warfare experiments under various different terrains, climates, and conditions. American generals such as General Creasy, Chief of the Research and Development Department of the Army Chemical Corps, and General White, former Chief of the Army Chemical Corps, have constantly and publicly touted the so-called economic value and effectiveness of bacteriological warfare, advocating its unrestricted use. The US government has consistently refused to ratify the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, on the prohibition of the use of poisonous gas and bacteriological weapons. The US government has also repeatedly rejected Soviet proposals to ban atomic weapons and implement international supervision. These have all created the threat of a new war and must be stopped immediately with effective measures.
    All peace-loving people must not tolerate the continued existence of the threat of a new war. People should not tolerate the "American responsibility for the Vietnam War" advertised by American newspapers, nor should they tolerate the plan to "link the three battlefields of Korea-Taiwan-Vietnam under American command." People cannot tolerate the fact that Japanese munitions production is accelerating its recovery with the support of the United States, that militarist elements are regrouping on the Japanese political stage, and that a "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance" centered on Japanese militarist forces and manipulated by the United States is being conceived; people must not tolerate the fact that the countries of the European Atlantic aggressive pact are intensifying their arms expansion and war preparations under the threat and enticement of the United States, and that West German Nazi revanchist elements are beginning to bare their fangs and claws again. People cannot fail to see that the imperialist war policy is seriously threatening the survival of mankind in Asia and the world, and at the same time is increasingly plunging the people of imperialist countries into an abyss of disaster and suffering. Since the Korean War, more than 320,000 American youths have been injured or killed, and the US direct military budget for 1952-53 has increased more than three and a half times compared with 1949-50, and 57 times compared with 1937-38 (before World War II). These burdens mainly weigh on the shoulders of the American working people. In 1951-52, the total amount of various taxes was 87 billion US dollars, an increase of more than 30 billion US dollars compared with 1949-50. The living conditions of the American people have deteriorated sharply, purchasing power has declined, and the number of unemployed and underemployed people has reached 13 million. The situation is even more serious in the vassal states of the United States. Therefore, preventing the threat of another world war and maintaining lasting world peace has become the common demand of people all over the world, including the American people. The Polish proposal is based on this unanimous wish of the people of the world.
    The most important feature of the Polish proposal is that it reflects the wishes of all peace-loving people in the world and points out the correct path to prevent the threat of another world war, maintain lasting world peace and strengthen international security. In addition to recommending that the Korean War must be stopped immediately, that all prisoners of war be repatriated in accordance with international conventions and international practices, and that the Korean issue be resolved peacefully, the Polish proposal also suggests that the five countries of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China reduce their armaments by one-third within one year; it suggests that a resolution be passed immediately to achieve the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, requiring all countries that have not yet acceded to or ratified the Geneva Protocol of 1925 on the prohibition of the use of poisonous gas and bacteriological weapons should immediately accede to and ratify this protocol; it suggests that all member states of the United Nations should not participate in groups aimed at aggression against another member state and creating international suspicion and tension, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization aggressive group, and urges the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China to sign a peace pact to guarantee lasting world peace. If these suggestions in the Polish proposal can be adopted and implemented, they can eliminate international suspicion and tension, eliminate the threat of another world war, enable the long-term peaceful coexistence of the two systems, restore normal economic and cultural exchanges between countries, and implement friendly cooperation in resolving international affairs.
    The governments and people of the countries in the peace, democracy and socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, abhor war and support peace. The Soviet delegation has repeatedly put forward proposals with the same content at previous sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, but each time it has been rejected by the United States. As pointed out by the head of the Soviet delegation, A.Y. Vyshinsky, in his speech to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 9th of this month when discussing the Polish proposal, "The Soviet Union has been striving to stop the Korean War for three years, and the Soviet Union has also been striving for many years to resolve other important unresolved issues: Such as the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of effective international control, and the issue of concluding a peace pact among the five major powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, China and France." "The efforts made by the Soviet Union to resolve these issues as soon as possible stem from the entire direction of Soviet foreign policy, the foundation of which, according to the wise definition of J.V. Stalin, is the idea of peace, and the struggle for international peace and friendship, and for strengthening and developing international cooperation." These peace proposals of the Soviet Union also represent the proposals of all peace-loving people around the world. This proposal is completely consistent with the current Polish proposal. Therefore, if the current session of the United Nations General Assembly still wants to fulfill its due responsibility of defending peace, it has no reason to reject the Polish proposal.
    The Chinese people know very well, the Korean people know very well, and the peace-loving people in the Far East and around the world know very well: Peace must be won through our firm struggle, and by uniting all peace-loving people, regardless of skin color or nationality, regardless of religion or political views, to jointly undertake the cause of defending peace. Even if the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States, rejects the Polish proposal, peace-loving people all over the world will follow the path pointed out by the Polish proposal and actively launch a struggle to stop the threat of a new war in order to maintain world peace.

### 拥护波兰提案维护世界和平

    拥护波兰提案维护世界和平
    波兰人民共和国外交部部长斯克列杰夫斯基向本届联合国大会提出的旨在防止另一次世界大战威胁、维护和平、加强国际安全的提案，已经在联合国大会开始讨论了。我们中国人民，完全拥护波兰外长这一提案，认为它完全符合全世界人民对于和平的愿望，是目前消除另一次世界大战威胁、保障各国人民和平生活的唯一正确的道路。
    波兰的提案首先指出：必须立刻停止朝鲜战争；根据国际规则遣返所有战俘；所有外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内，在两三个月之内一律撤出朝鲜；和平解决朝鲜问题，使朝鲜人民能够在一个委员会的监督下建立统一的国家。这一建议针对目前国际形势中的最主要的一个问题，提出了最公平合理的解决办法。这是完全正当的。最近中朝方面根据一贯坚持的和平立场，采取重大步骤促使双方就在战争期间遣返病伤战俘问题进行了顺利的谈判并达成了协议。中朝方面并且主张，遣返病伤战俘问题的合理解决，应当使之引导到整个战俘问题的顺利解决，从而促进朝鲜停战，和平解决朝鲜问题。我国政务院总理周恩来和朝鲜内阁首相金日成最近曾为解决整个战俘问题提出了新建议，表示了在这个问题上为着消除双方的分歧而作的步骤上的让步，从而扫清了立即恢复双方代表团会议以解决整个战俘问题的道路。现在，遣返病伤战俘问题既已达成协议，立即恢复停战谈判以解决整个战俘问题和实现停战的问题就提上了日程。正如我国周恩来总理三月三十日的声明中所指出的，“随着病伤战俘问题的合理解决，只要双方都真正具有互相让步以促成朝鲜停战的诚意，全部战俘问题的顺利解决，是完全应当的。”因为只有结束朝鲜战争并签订停战协定，才能消除新战争的威胁，才能巩固国际的和平与安全。现在，全世界一切爱好和平的人民受着中朝方面为和平而作的重大努力所鼓舞，都关怀和注视着板门店的情势，要看一看美国政府对于全面解决整个战俘问题和朝鲜停战问题究竟有无真正的诚意。
    美国政府在朝鲜北部及我国东北等地区所进行的细菌战同样必须立即加以有效的制止。中国的和世界各国的著名科学家、民主法律工作者及社会公众领袖经过实地调查，获得了无数确凿的证件，对于这些证件，美国政府没有任何官员和军官能出来推翻其中任何的一点。亲手在朝鲜和中国东北上空撒布细菌的美空军人员和亲自布置执行美国参谋长联席会议细菌战命令的美国高级军官的口供更进一步地证实了美国进行细菌战的事实，对于这些供词，美国政府同样也没有任何一位官员和军官能出来反驳其中的任何一件事实或更正其中的任何一个字母。但是美国政府现在还正在进行细菌战，而且在美国及日本各地设立了许多研究和制造细菌武器的机构，正在积极准备扩大细菌战。美国政府不仅在朝鲜北部和中国东北等地区进行细菌战，而且用朝中和平人民和朝中被俘人员在各种不同的地形、气候和条件下作细菌战试验。美国的将军们如陆军化学兵团研究与发展处处长克利西将军、前陆军部化学兵团司令怀特将军等，都曾不断公开高谈其所谓细菌战的经济价值及其效力，主张无限制地加以使用。美国政府一直拒绝批准一九二五年六月十七日关于禁止使用毒气和细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。美国政府还一再否决苏联关于禁止原子武器和实行国际监督的建议。这些都造成了新战争的威胁，都是必须采取有效的措施立即加以制止的。
    一切爱好和平的人民决不能容忍新战争的威胁继续存在。人们不应该容忍美国报纸所宣传的“美国对越南战争的责任”，不能容忍所谓“在美国指挥下把朝鲜——台湾——越南三个战场联系起来”的计划。人们对于在美国支持下日本军火生产正加速恢复，军国主义分子在日本政治舞台上又重整旗鼓，一个在美国操纵下的以日本军国主义势力为核心的“太平洋反共联盟”正在孕育中的事实不能容忍；人们对于欧洲大西洋侵略公约各国正在美国威胁利诱下加紧扩军备战，西德纳粹复仇主义分子又开始张牙舞爪的事实也决不能容忍。人们不能不看到帝国主义的战争政策正在严重威胁着亚洲和全世界人类的生存，同时也使帝国主义国家的人民日益陷于灾难和痛苦的深渊中。自朝鲜战争以来，已经有三十二万以上美国青年遭受伤亡，一九五二—五三年度美国直接军费预算比一九四九—五○年度增加了三倍半以上，比一九三七——三八年度（第二次世界大战前）则增加了五十七倍。这些负担，主要压在美国劳动人民的肩上。一九五一——五二年度，各种赋税总额为八百七十亿美元，比一九四九——五○年度增加了三百多亿美元。美国人民生活状况急剧恶化，购买力下降，失业半失业人数达一千三百万人。在美国的附庸国家里，情况还要更加严重。所以，防止另一次世界大战的威胁，维护世界的持久和平，已经成为全世界人民——包括美国人民在内的共同要求了。波兰的提案，就是基于这个全世界人民一致的愿望提出来的。
    波兰提案的最重要的特点，在于它反映了世界一切爱好和平人民的愿望，指出了防止另一次大战威胁、维护世界持久和平和加强国际安全的正确途径。波兰提案除了建议必须立即停止朝鲜战争，根据国际公约和国际惯例遣返全部战俘，和平解决朝鲜问题以外，还建议美、苏、英、法、中五国在一年内裁减三分之一的军备；建议立即通过决议以实现禁止原子武器和其他大规模毁灭的武器，要求所有还没有参加或批准一九二五年关于禁止使用毒气和细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的国家应即参加和批准这个议定书；建议所有联合国会员国不得参加旨在侵略另一会员国、造成国际猜疑和紧张局势的集团，如北大西洋公约侵略集团，并敦促美国、苏联、英国、法国和我国政府签订一个和平公约，以保障世界持久和平。波兰提案的这些建议如果能获得通过并付诸实施，就能消除国际间的猜疑和紧张局势，消除另一次世界大战的威胁，使两个制度长期和平共处，恢复各国间正常的经济交流和文化交流，并在解决国际事务中实行友好合作。
    我们以苏联为首的和平民主和社会主义阵营各国的政府和人民是憎恶战争、拥护和平的。苏联代表团就曾在历届联合国大会上屡次提出同样内容的提案，但每次都遭到美国的拒绝。正如苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基在本月九日联合国大会政治委员会讨论波兰提案时发表的演说中所指出的，“苏联已经是第三年力求停止朝鲜战争了，苏联许多年来也一直力求解决其他尚未解决的重要问题：如裁减军备、禁止原子武器并建立有效的国际管制、缔结苏美英中法五大国和平公约的问题等。”“苏联为了尽速解决这些问题所做的努力，是从苏联外交政策的整个方针出发的，这个方针的基础，按照约·维·斯大林的英明定义来说，便是和平的思想，是为国际和平与友好、为加强和发展国际合作而奋斗。”苏联的这些和平主张，也正是代表着全世界一切爱好和平人民的主张。这个主张和现在波兰的提案是完全一致的。因此，本届联合国大会如果还想履行它应有的保卫和平的职责的话，它就没有理由再拒绝波兰的提案。
    中国人民很清楚地知道，朝鲜人民很清楚地知道，远东各国和全世界爱好和平的人们都很清楚地知道：和平必须靠我们坚决的斗争去争取，靠我们把所有爱好和平的人们不分肤色或民族，不分宗教或政治见解，一致团结起来，共同把保卫和平的事业担当起来。即使联合国大会在美国操纵下否决波兰的提案，全世界爱好和平的人民都将遵循波兰提案所指出的道路，积极展开斗争，制止新战争的威胁，以维护世界的和平。
