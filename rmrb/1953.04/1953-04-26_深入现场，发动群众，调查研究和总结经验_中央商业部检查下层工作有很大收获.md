    Going Deep into the Field, Mobilizing the Masses, Investigating and Researching, and Summarizing Experience:
    Central Ministry of Commerce Gains Greatly from Inspecting Work at Lower Levels
    In late February, the Central People's Government's Ministry of Commerce dispatched a large number of cadres to form inspection teams, which went to certain grassroots units in various regions to inspect work. The work of these inspection teams has now come to an end and has been reported to the Central Ministry of Commerce.
    This inspection work has yielded great results because it implemented the spirit of "going deep into the field, mobilizing the masses" and "investigating and researching, summarizing experience." First, through inspecting grassroots work, the shortcomings of the leading organs were further exposed. The current chaos in the work of grassroots units and the deviations in the execution of tasks are mainly caused by the fact that some instructions and decisions of the leading organs are not in line with the actual situation, the arrangements are multi-headed, and the ideological leadership is weak. At the end of last December, the Ministry of Commerce's regulations on urban and rural regional price differences were fundamentally correct in spirit, but because the calculation of expenses was too high, the standard of price differences was also set too high, which contributed to the phenomenon that private merchants in small cities did not purchase goods locally, but went to large and medium-sized cities to purchase goods, increasing the chaos in the market. Regarding the establishment of wholesale stations and the verification of funds by various units, there were some discrepancies between the arrangements of the Commercial Department's Technical Bureau and the Financial Accounting Bureau, and the specific methods of the two were not completely consistent, leaving the lower levels at a loss. In this inspection work, it was found that the deviations in the implementation of the economic accounting system in various units were mostly caused by the lack of clarity on the meaning, purpose, and practices of the economic accounting system. Local workers requested that the Ministry of Commerce conduct a comprehensive and specific publicity of the economic accounting system, so that the implementation of the economic accounting system in the state-owned commercial system would be transformed from a propaganda slogan into the actual action of all workers. These serious situations, exposed by the masses from many aspects, were of great educational significance to the cadres.
    Secondly, in this inspection work, some ways to solve specific problems were also found, and the grassroots organizations were helped to solve the main problems in their work. After the state-owned department store system implemented the economic accounting system, because the idea of the supply system had not been completely overcome and the idea of the economic accounting system had not been fully established, some units, although they had begun to implement the economic accounting system, did not do it very well. Since its establishment in November last year, the Handan Department Store Wholesale Station has not actively played its role in organizing sources of goods and ensuring supply. On the contrary, there was a passive waiting attitude, relying on the central station to convene supply meetings to solve all problems. Many urgent matters remained in the preparation stage, lacking the work style of actively clarifying, solving, and implementing problems to the end. After these shortcomings were exposed, the deputy manager of the station further realized that in order to implement policies and ensure supply, it was necessary to overcome the idea of the supply system. Due to inaccurate planning, there is a serious situation in many regions of the country where the same kind of goods are both overstocked and out of stock, which is a problem that urgently needs to be solved by the current state-owned commercial system. Through the supply meeting of the Shanghai Central Department Store Wholesale Station, the inspection team convened representative meetings of salespersons of several specialized commodities in several units, which not only solved the problem of overstocking on one hand and out of stock on the other, but more importantly, fundamentally improved the planning idea—realized the role of investigation and research in commerce, and found a way to improve the accuracy of the commodity circulation plan of state-owned commerce. The Shanghai Department Store Supply Conference, because it clarified the urban production situation before the meeting, drew up a commodity catalog, and displayed more than 20,000 kinds of commodities, not only broadened the horizons of the participants, but also reduced the blindness of ordering goods by looking at samples. At the representative meeting of salespersons of specialized commodities, the reasons for the overstocking of some commodities on one hand and the out of stock on the other were found, mainly because there were problems in the management ideas and methods. The salesperson representatives said: "In the past, they did not understand the purpose, significance, and methods of formulating plans, and subjectively filled in the plans, because they were afraid of overstocking, the plans were always conservative, and if they were out of stock, they would rely on supplementary plans to deal with them. Now they have realized that the idea of famous brands, the idea of relying on supplementary plans, and the lazy idea of not using their brains are all impossible to make good plans." In addition, ways to solve the problems of inconsistent accounts and goods, unclear family assets, and disconnection between upper and lower levels in various independent accounting units have also been found. The Shanghai Central Department Store Wholesale Station, after exposing and criticizing the lazy ideas and practices of using surpluses to make up for shortages and offsetting various errors against each other in the past when clearing assets, has adopted the method of comparing accounts with accounts, comparing accounts with goods, and investigating the reasons for discrepancies on a case-by-case basis, and has been able to more thoroughly clarify the family assets. The Wuhan Department Store Wholesale Station, after finding out that the reason for the chaotic system, numerous procedures, and the need for thirteen days for goods to enter and leave the warehouse was due to improper organizational settings, has mobilized the masses, changed the organization according to the principle of accelerating commodity circulation, re-discussed and formulated the system, and shortened the time for leaving the warehouse to three and a half days.
    In addition, through this inspection work, the ideological level of the leading organs and grassroots units' cadres has been improved. The grassroots cadres have strengthened their sense of responsibility and improved their enthusiasm for studying their business because they have clarified the policy requirements and their own position and role. The cadres of the leading organs have improved their awareness because they have contacted the reality and personally experienced the significant impact of their own work.
    However, in this inspection work, some groups took some detours because they did not reach a consensus with the relevant local leaders and the inspected units in their ideological understanding. The Shanghai working group did not reach a consensus with the relevant local leading departments on the focus and steps of inspecting the work of the Shanghai Central Department Store Wholesale Station in advance, so at the mobilization meeting, the inspection team emphasized that the focus of the work was to clarify the family assets, the wholesale station emphasized that the central task was to hold a good supply meeting, and the East China Commercial Administration Bureau emphasized reasonable reserves. As a result, the forces of all parties could not cooperate well, and the inspection team fell into a state of "fighting alone." When the Hunan working group of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company assisted in building a station and verifying assets in Hunan, they did not study the significance of implementing economic accounting with the Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce in advance, and did not explain the significance of implementing economic accounting to the cadres of the provincial company, resulting in disputes due to disagreements, which affected the smooth progress of the work. According to the reports of the directors of the major administrative regions' commercial administration bureaus and the reports of the inspection teams, the Central Ministry of Commerce determined at the meeting of the directors of the major administrative regions' commercial administration bureaus that the central work for the second quarter was to: continue to implement the economic accounting system, arrange the market to complete the purchase and sales plan and the financial plan, and lay the foundation for the peak season work. It was also decided that from the end of April, more than 2,000 cadres (including the Ministry of Commerce itself, the Commercial Administration Bureaus of various regions, the Provincial Commercial Departments, various General Companies, and Provincial and Municipal Companies) would be organized to conduct a unified, in-depth, and large-scale inspection of grassroots work. In terms of implementing the economic accounting system, in addition to vigorously promoting, publicizing, supplementing, and revising existing experiences, two experiences will be focused on summarizing: 1. How to closely link the first and second-level wholesale stations with the third-level stores to accelerate the circulation of goods and funds; 2. How to improve the accounting methods to ensure that accounts and goods match. In terms of arranging the market, the focus will be on studying: 1. How to correctly calculate various price differences; 2. How to further organize the exchange of local products. At the same time, preliminary arrangements have been made for the work of key units, and it has been decided to summarize comprehensive experience in early June. (Bi Ying)

    深入现场，发动群众，调查研究和总结经验
    中央商业部检查下层工作有很大收获
    中央人民政府商业部在二月下旬派遣大批干部，组成检查组，分别到各个地区的某些基层单位去检查工作。这些检查组的工作现已告一段落，并已向中央商业部作了汇报。
    这次检查工作由于贯彻了“深入现场、发动群众”及“调查研究、总结经验”的精神，因而收获很大。首先，通过检查基层工作，进一步暴露了领导机关的缺点。目前基层单位工作混乱、执行任务中有偏差，主要是领导机关的若干指示决定不切合实际情况，布置多头，以及思想领导薄弱所造成的。去年十二月底，商业部规定的城乡地区差价，基本精神是正确的，但由于对费用的计算过高，所以差价的标准也定得偏高，助长了小城市私商不在当地进货，纷纷到大、中城市去进货的现象，增加了市场的混乱。对于各单位建立批发站、核定资金的计算办法，商业部组织技术局和财务会计局的布置就有若干出入，而且二者的具体办法不尽相符，使下边无所适从。在这次检查工作中，发现各单位在实行经济核算制中的偏差，绝大部分是由于对经济核算制的意义、目的与做法不明确所产生的。各地职工要求商业部对于经济核算制进行全面而具体的宣传，从而使实行经济核算制在国营商业系统中，由宣传口号变为全体职工的实际行动。这些严重情况，经群众多方面的揭发，给干部的教育意义很大。
    其次，在这次检查工作中，也找到了一些解决具体问题的途径，帮助基层组织解决了工作中的主要问题。国营百货系统在实行经济核算制后，由于供给制思想未得到彻底克服，经济核算制思想尚未全面树立，所以有些单位虽然已开始实行经济核算制，但作得还很不好。邯郸百货批发站自去年十一月建立以来，并没有积极地发挥自己的地位与作用，组织货源，保证供应。相反的还有消极等待、依靠中央站召开供应会议来解决一切问题的思想。许多需要急办的事情，都停留在准备阶段，缺乏主动把问题弄清，加以解决和贯彻到底的工作作风。在这些缺点被揭发后，该站副经理才进一步明白了要克服供给制思想，才能贯彻政策，保证供应。由于计划订得不准确，全国有不少地区出现同类商品一面积压、一面脱销的严重情况，这是当前国营商业系统急需解决的问题。经过上海中央百货批发站的供应会议，检查组在几个单位召开了几种专门商品营业员代表会议，不但解决了一面积压一面脱销的问题，更重要的是从根本上提高了计划思想——认识了调查研究对商业的作用，为提高国营商业的商品流转计划的准确性找到了道路。上海百货供应会议由于会前摸清了城市生产情况，订出了商品目录，陈列了二万多种商品，这不仅扩大了到会者的眼界，而且看样定货，减少了盲目性。在专门商品营业员代表会议上，找出了若干商品一面积压、一面脱销的原因，主要是因为经营思想与经营方法上有毛病。营业员代表说：“过去不明白编制计划的目的、意义与方法，主观地往上填，因为怕积压，计划总是保守的，如果脱销，就靠补充计划来应付。现在他们已认识到名牌货思想、依靠补充计划的思想，与不动脑筋的懒惰思想，都是不能做好计划的。还有在各个独立核算单位帐货不符、家底不清，以及上下、内外联系脱节的问题上，也找到了解决的途径。上海中央百货批发站，在揭发并批判了过去在清理资产时采用的以长补短，把各种差错相互对消的懒惰思想和作法后，采用以帐对帐、以帐对货，逐笔追究不符的原因的办法，已能够较为彻底的弄清家底。武汉百货批发站在找出了因为机构设置不当因而制度混乱、手续繁多、进出货各需十三天的原因后，已发动群众，根据加速商品流转的原则改变机构，重新讨论并拟订了制度，缩短出库时间为三天半。
    另外，经过这次检查工作，提高了领导机关与基层单位干部的思想水平，基层干部由于明确了政策要求与本身的地位与作用，加强了责任心，也提高了钻研业务的热情；领导机关的干部，由于接触了实际，亲身体会了本身工作的重大影响，提高了觉悟。
    但在这次检查工作中，有些小组由于在思想认识上没有和当地有关领导和被检查单位取得一致，也走了一些弯路。上海工作组对检查上海中央百货批发站工作的重点与步骤，事先未与当地有关领导部门取得一致，所以在动员大会上，检查组强调工作重点是摸清家底，批发站强调中心工作是开好供应会议，华东商业管理局则强调合理储备，结果各方面的力量不能很好配合，检查组陷于“孤军作战”的境地。中国煤业建筑器材公司湖南工作组在湖南协助建站核资时，事前没有和湖南省商业厅研究好，没有把贯彻经济核算的意义向省公司的干部交代清楚，结果因意见不一致曾发生争执，影响了工作的顺利进展。中央商业部根据各大行政区商业管理局局长汇报及检查组汇报的情况，在大区商业管理局局长会议上，确定了第二季度的中心工作是：继续贯彻经济核算制，安排市场完成购销计划和财务计划，为旺季工作打下基础。并决定从四月下旬起，组织二千多干部（包括商业部本身与各区商业管理局及各省商业厅、各总公司、省市公司），对基层工作进行一次统一的深入的大规模检查。在贯彻经济核算制方面，除大力推广、宣传、补充修正已有的经验外，着重总结二条经验：一、如何紧密一、二级批发站与三级商店之间的联系，使商品、资金加速流转；二、如何改进记帐办法，保证帐货相符。在安排市场方面，着重研究：一、如何正确计算各种差价；二、怎样进一步组织土产交流。同时对重点单位的工作，已作初步部署，决定在六月上旬总结全面经验。                    （毕莹）
