Xinhua News Agency, New York: According to TASS, at the meetings of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 13th and 14th, the discussion continued on Poland's proposal for "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Strengthen International Peace and Friendly Cooperation."

    The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, David, spoke at the meeting on the 13th, supporting the Polish proposal's recommendations on ceasing the Korean War and concluding an armistice agreement, reducing armaments, banning atomic weapons, and concluding a peace pact among the five major powers. David emphasized that resolving the issue of ceasing the Korean War would create the preconditions for resolving other contentious issues and alleviating the current international tensions. He drew the Committee's attention to the noble and humane decision of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war, and pointed out that the Soviet government, which has consistently insisted on ending the Korean War, has authorized Foreign Minister Molotov to express its willingness to help facilitate the implementation of recommendations on resuming Korean negotiations in order to reach an agreement on the entire prisoner-of-war issue and on ending the Korean War. David then pointed out that if the Chinese and Korean people had their legitimate representatives in the United Nations, it would greatly contribute to the discussion of the Korean issue and would equally contribute to the discussion of other important issues concerning world peace and security.
    The Czechoslovak representative criticized the negative attitude of the US representative towards the Polish proposal and urged the delegations of other countries to vote in favor of the Polish proposal.
    The head of the Belarusian delegation, Kiselev, stated in his speech on the 14th: The Polish proposal is in line with the greatest interests of peace-loving people of all countries in the world and expresses their desire for peace. Poland's recommendations stipulate an early and fair resolution of the entire Korean issue. Everyone knows that the Korean War is a particularly dangerous threat to the cause of peace, so the Korean issue is the most important issue that needs to be resolved immediately. Kiselev said: The Korean armistice negotiations, which have continued for more than a year, have laid the foundation for a Korean armistice, and the representatives of both sides have reached an agreement on all issues except for the prisoner-of-war issue. Now, an agreement has been reached in Panmunjom on the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, and we hope that the entire issue of prisoner repatriation will soon be fully and fairly resolved.
    The Belarusian representative supported Poland's proposal that the United Nations General Assembly declare that participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is incompatible with membership in the United Nations, as well as recommendations on disarmament. Kiselev said: These recommendations in the Polish proposal succinctly and concisely put forward solutions to measures of extreme importance to the people of all countries in the world. If the United Nations adopts the Polish proposal, it will be of great significance in eliminating the threat of another world war and strengthening world peace, and will undoubtedly enhance the credibility of the United Nations as a tool for peace.
    At the meeting on the 13th, the representatives of the Netherlands, New Zealand, Panama, Israel, and Australia, who spoke, expressed their opposition to the General Assembly's adoption of the Polish proposal, but they could not put forward any convincing arguments to support their claims. The speeches of the Cuban and Dominican representatives were simply unrelated to the Polish proposal. At the meeting on the 14th, the representatives of Greece, Turkey, and other countries repeated some of the absurd arguments put forward by representatives of other countries, expressing their opposition to the Polish proposal.

    捷克斯洛伐克和白俄罗斯代表在联大政委会上发言
    主张通过波兰提案公正解决整个朝鲜问题
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会在十三日和十四日的会议上，继续讨论波兰提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的措施”的提案。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长戴维在十三日会议上发言，支持波兰提案中关于停止朝鲜战争和缔结停战协定、裁减军备、禁止原子武器、缔结五大国和平公约的各项建议。戴维着重指出，停止朝鲜战争问题的解决，将为解决其他引起纠纷的问题及缓和目前的国际紧张局势创造先决条件。他提请委员会注意中华人民共和国中央人民政府及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于遣返战俘的崇高与人道的决定，并指出一贯坚持结束朝鲜战争的苏联政府已授权外交部长莫洛托夫，表示它愿意协力促使关于恢复朝鲜谈判的建议得以实施，以便达成关于整个战俘问题的协议及关于结束朝鲜战争的协议。戴维接着指出，如果中国人民和朝鲜人民在联合国有他们的合法的代表，将大大地有助于关于朝鲜问题的讨论，并将同样有助于关于世界和平与安全的其他重要问题的讨论。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表批评美国代表对波兰提案的否定态度，并促请其他国家的代表团投票赞成波兰提案。
    白俄罗斯代表团团长基谢列夫在十四日发言时指出：波兰提案符合全世界各国爱好和平的人民的最大利益，并表达了他们争取和平的意愿。波兰的建议规定早日公平地解决整个朝鲜问题。人人都知道朝鲜战争是对和平事业的一种特别危险，因此朝鲜问题是一个需要立即解决的最重大的问题。基谢列夫说：继续了一年以上的朝鲜停战谈判已经为朝鲜停战奠下了基础，双方代表除了战俘问题之外，已在一切问题上达成协议。现在，在板门店已达成了交换病伤战俘的协议，我们希望整个战俘遣返问题不久将获得完全的、公正的解决。
    白俄罗斯代表支持波兰提出的联合国大会宣布参加北大西洋公约集团与联合国会员身份是不相容的，以及关于裁减军备等项建议。基谢列夫说：波兰提案的这些建议，简明扼要地提出了解决对全世界各国人民极关重要的措施。如果联合国通过波兰提案，对消除另一次世界大战威胁及加强世界和平都会具有重大的意义，并且毫无疑问地将会提高联合国作为和平工具的威信。
    在十三日会议上发言的荷兰、新西兰、巴拿马、以色列和澳大利亚的代表，他们表示反对大会通过波兰提案，但是他们提不出什么令人信服的论据来支持他们的主张。古巴和多米尼加代表的发言简直和波兰提案毫无关系。在十四日会议上，希腊、土耳其等国的代表重复了一些其他国家代表提出的荒唐论据，表示反对波兰提案。
