The in-service cadres in Songjiang Province have maintained an upward learning enthusiasm since the resumption of normal systematic theoretical study in August last year. Especially after studying Malenkov's report, cadres' understanding and confidence in theoretical study have significantly improved, and learning methods have also been improved.

The CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee believes that doing a good job in the theoretical study of senior cadres is not only the key to doing a good job in the study of cadres throughout the province, but also has great significance for improving current practical work. Therefore, after the "Three-Anti" and Party rectification campaigns ended, the Provincial Committee made up its mind to make doing a good job in the theoretical study of cadres, especially senior cadres, one of the Provincial Committee's regular and important tasks. Comrade Li Changqing, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, and all members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee personally took charge of the leadership and frequently studied and improved the leadership methods and learning methods. This not only ensured that the study of senior cadres achieved results, but also achieved preliminary experience in strengthening the combination of the study of senior cadres and general cadres.

In terms of learning leadership, the Provincial Committee first used its own practical actions to urge and encourage the study of senior cadres and the broad masses of middle and junior cadres, and paid attention to carrying out criticism and self-criticism in learning. The core study group, mainly composed of members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee, has consistently adhered to the collective learning system and other learning systems since the resumption of learning last year, such as not receiving guests, not discussing work, not answering the phone, and not asking for leave during study time. The Provincial Committee's example greatly inspired the learning consciousness of senior cadres and the broad masses of middle and junior cadres. In the past, some leading cadres of cities and counties often used the excuse of being busy with work to relax their regular theoretical study; but when they saw the learning situation of the Provincial Committee and the cadres of the provincial directly affiliated units under the direct leadership of the Provincial Committee, they were deeply moved and said: "The work of the Provincial Committee is much busier than ours, and they can still persist in learning, what else can we say!" The learning situation of the leading cadres in Jiamusi, Linkou, Hulan and other cities and counties has gradually improved as a result. For a small number of senior cadres with deeper inertia and insufficient understanding of learning, Comrade Li Changqing, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, repeatedly educated them in conjunction with various study meetings and gave them serious criticism. Those comrades who studied well were given appropriate praise. Because the Provincial Committee's study took the lead and set an example, these criticisms and praises had great persuasiveness and achieved significant results. Senior cadres not only did not feel constrained by the Provincial Committee's tight leadership, but also generally felt satisfied, believing that they could not learn well without it. Many comrades said: This kind of study is the first time since joining the revolution or coming to Songjiang Province. Some comrades said: "If we had studied like this for the past ten years of revolution, our theoretical level would not be so low."

Secondly, the Provincial Committee's own study strives to take the first step, timely pointing out the center and requirements of each chapter to everyone, and correctly guiding everyone to grasp the central issues and conduct in-depth research by means of issuing discussion questions. For example, when studying the second part of Malenkov's report, many comrades could not grasp the center, could not raise questions, and the study was slow. The Provincial Committee promptly formulated clear discussion questions based on the spirit of the document, pointing out the key points. This helped and inspired everyone, pushing the study forward. Also, because the Provincial Committee's study took the first step, it was able to timely propose important reference materials for each chapter or each controversial issue. This is an indispensable guide for comrades with a weaker theoretical foundation and less reading. In the past, many comrades read reference books indiscriminately, and as a result, the more they read, the less they grasped the center, as if they were in a vast sea, at a loss. This distressing phenomenon has now been overcome.

Thirdly, the Provincial Committee adopts the method of dividing labor to help groups and focusing on studying problems for the study of general senior groups, so as to realize the specific leadership of the core group. In the study of "On Contradiction," Malenkov's report, and "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," the Provincial Committee specifically divided the work to guide certain groups. During normal reading, they went deep into the groups to check the learning situation, or convened group leaders to report to understand the problems in learning; they personally participated in and grasped the discussions in groups, specifically inspiring and guiding. For example, timely answer some trivial questions and general difficult questions raised in the discussion, avoiding the discussion meeting spending too much time on these questions, so that everyone's attention is focused on the discussion of major issues. At the end of the discussion, make a summary speech. For principled controversial issues, bring them back to the core group for research, and then bring them up to the group for discussion. This method makes the learning of the core group and the general senior group closely connected, so that the leadership can grasp the situation at any time, be clear in mind, be in a proactive position, and be able to foresee, so that learning will not be entangled in some issues that cannot be concluded for a while, and stagnate.

In addition, when studying Malenkov's report, the Provincial Committee adopted the form of thematic speeches to further deepen the study, and combined the study of the leading comrades of the Provincial Committee with the study of senior and middle-level groups. The learning situation at that time was: because most cadres (including senior cadres) lacked economic knowledge and knowledge within the Party, it was generally difficult to deeply study the second and third parts of Malenkov's report, and they felt distressed and lacked confidence. The core group timely studied this situation and decided that the Provincial Committee should give thematic speeches on one or two issues related to its own business. For example, Comrade Qiang Xiaochu, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Committee, spoke on the fundamental policy of Soviet industrialization, Comrade Ren Zhongyi, Secretary-General, spoke on raising labor productivity and practicing economy, Comrade Yu Lin, Minister of Propaganda, spoke on the improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people, Comrade Yu Jie, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Government, spoke on the superiority of socialist agriculture, and Comrade Wang Bojin, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Committee, spoke on the organizational discipline of the Party, etc. Everyone made full preparations for the problems they were assigned to. Under the auspices of the core group, three large discussion meetings were held successively, not only with the participation of all senior group comrades, but also with the participation of cadres who were studying "A Brief History of the Communist Party of China." The thematic speeches of the Provincial Committee, due to the systematic narration, profound analysis, and appropriate connection with the reality of China and the reality of the province, gave great enlightenment and education to more than 200 senior and middle-level cadres who participated in the discussion meeting, not only directly improving the cadres' level of understanding on several issues, but also enabling the cadres to further learn the method of connecting with reality. Everyone generally reflected that they had gained a lot, improved their interest in learning, and strengthened their confidence in learning. After returning to their units, the senior cadres who participated in the discussion meeting also conveyed the situation to the general cadres in conjunction with the learning situation of their units, thereby improving the understanding of the broad masses of cadres. Facts have proved that through this form of thematic speeches, not only the Provincial Committee's study is combined with the study of senior cadres and general cadres, and the enthusiasm and ideological level of the broad masses of cadres in the provincial directly affiliated units are improved on the overall scale, but also the Provincial Committee's own study is promoted. In order to make good thematic speeches, the Provincial Committee must conduct in-depth research and repeated thinking. The facts are also like this. The thematic speeches of the Provincial Committee are mostly their personal learning experiences, and each has different degrees of unique insights, so they are deeply welcomed by senior and middle-level cadres. Some city and county Party committees in Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Ning'an, etc. learned the Provincial Committee's method to lead the study of cadres in their regions, and also achieved good results. However, when using this method, it must be based on full group discussions, and combined with the analysis and criticism of various erroneous ideas and confused views exposed in the group discussions. In this way, the problem will be solved more deeply and specifically, and the education and enlightenment for cadres will be greater.

Finally, the Provincial Committee in the learning leadership also frequently emphasized the importance of the method of linking theory with practice for learning, emphasizing that when learning, we must consider the guiding significance of the principles and conclusions in the document for our current revolutionary practice, and timely discover and criticize various dogmatic learning biases such as empty talk and detachment from reality in learning. At the beginning of the study, the Provincial Committee advocated first repeatedly studying the document, seeking to thoroughly understand the spirit of the document, and then linking the principled issues in thought and work, and展开讨论 according to the arguments of the document, combining the solution of the actual problems to be linked. The Provincial Committee not only advocated and introduced this correct learning method at the learning conference, but also consciously implemented this learning method throughout the entire learning process. For example, when studying "On Contradiction," a small number of comrades only focused on nouns, and Comrade Li Changqing, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, immediately pointed out that this attitude of studying problems was wrong, ignoring the purpose of learning was to correctly guide practice, thereby correcting this learning bias. The Provincial Committee's earnest persuasion, close combination with reality, and combination with the problems exposed in learning, and conducting guidance on ideological methods and learning methods, greatly helped the cadres' improvement. Because the Provincial Committee used the above methods to lead the cadres' study, the study of the broad masses of cadres, especially senior cadres, was gradually brought into the right track, the learning enthusiasm became increasingly consolidated, and achievements were continuously obtained. Now everyone is full of confidence to meet the new learning tasks in 1953.

    中共松江省委是怎样领导干部理论学习的
    中共松江省委宣传部理论教育处
    松江省在职干部，从去年八月恢复正常的系统的理论学习以来，学习情绪一直是向上的；特别是对马林科夫报告的学习，干部对于理论学习的认识、信心都显著地提高了，学习方法也有了改进。
    中共松江省委认为搞好高级干部的理论学习，不但是搞好全省干部学习的关键，而且对于改进当前的实际工作有着重大的意义。因此，当“三反”与整党结束后，省委即下决心，把搞好干部理论学习，特别是高级干部的学习，当作省委经常的重要工作之一来做。省委书记李常青同志和省委各常委都亲自掌握领导，并经常研究改进学习的领导方法与学习方法。这样，不但保证了高级干部的学习取得成绩，而且在加强高级干部与一般干部的学习的结合上也取得了初步的经验。
    在学习领导上，省委首先通过本身的实际行动来督促、激励高级干部与广大中、初级干部的学习，并注意开展学习方面的批评与自我批评。以省委常委为主的学习核心组，从去年恢复学习以来，就始终坚持了集体学习制及其他各种学习制度，如学习时间不会客，不谈工作，不接电话，不请事假。省委的这种范例，大大地启发了高级干部与广大中、初级干部的学习自觉性。过去部分市、县领导干部，常以工作忙为理由，放松经常的理论学习；但当他们看到省委及在省委直接领导下的省直属各单位干部的学习情况时，都很受感动地说：“省委的工作比我们忙得多，还能坚持学习，我们还有什么话说呢！”佳木斯、林口、呼兰等市、县的领导干部的学习情况，都是因此而逐步有了改进的。对于少数惰性较深，对学习认识不足的高级干部，省委书记李常青同志则结合各种学习会反复地进行教育，并给以严肃的批评。对于学习得好的同志，则予以适当的表扬。由于省委的学习走在大家的前头，做出了榜样，因此，这些批评和表扬具有巨大的说服力，收到了显著的效果。高级干部对于省委的抓紧领导，不但不感觉到受约束，而且普遍感到满意，认为不如此就不能学好。不少同志表示：像这样的学习，参加革命以来或到松江省以来还是第一次。有的同志说：“参加革命十几年，如果都像今天这样学习，理论水平总不至于这样低了。”
    其次，省委本身的学习，力求先走一步，及时给大家指明每一章节的中心和要求，并通过出讨论题的方法，正确引导大家抓住中心问题，深入钻研。如学习马林科夫报告第二部分时，许多同志抓不住中心，提不出问题，学习迟滞不前。省委即及时根据文件的精神，拟出明确的讨论题，指出了重点。这就帮助和启发了大家，把学习推向前进。又由于省委的学习前走一步，因而能够及时提出每一章或每一个争论问题的重要参考材料。这对于理论基础较差读书不多的同志说来，是一个不可缺少的向导。过去不少同志无选择地看参考书，结果看的越多，越抓不住中心，仿佛浩若烟海，无所适从。这一令人苦恼的现象，现已克服。
    再次，省委对于一般高级组的学习，采取分工帮助小组、集中研究问题的方法，来实现核心组的具体领导。在学习“矛盾论”、马林科夫报告和“苏联社会主义经济问题”中，省委均具体分工指导一定小组。平常阅读时，深入小组检查学习情况，或召集组长汇报，了解学习中的问题；小组讨论时则亲身参加掌握，具体地启发诱导。如及时解答讨论中提出的一些枝节问题和一般的疑难问题，避免讨论会在这些问题上花费过多的时间，使大家注意力集中于主要问题的讨论。讨论结束时，则作总结性的发言。对于原则性的争论问题，则带回核心组研究，然后再提到小组去讨论。这种方法，使核心组与一般高级组的学习息息相通，领导方面得以随时掌握情况，心中有数，处于主动，能够有预见，使学习不致纠缠在某些一时不可能得出结论的问题上，而停滞不前。
    此外，在学习马林科夫报告的时候，省委采取专题发言的形式，把学习进一步引深，并把省委领导同志与高级、中级组的学习结合起来。当时的学习情况是：由于多数干部（包括高级干部在内）经济知识及党内的知识不足，因此对于马林科夫报告的第二、三部分普遍难于深钻，感到苦恼，缺乏信心。核心组及时研究了这一情况，就确定由省委分别就与本身业务有关的一至二个问题，作专题发言。如省委第二书记强晓初同志讲关于苏联工业化的根本方针问题，秘书长任仲夷同志讲关于提高劳动生产率与厉行节约等问题，宣传部长于林同志讲关于苏联人民物质福利、文化水平的提高问题，省府副主席于杰同志讲关于社会主义农业的优越性问题，省委副书记王伯谨同志讲关于党的组织纪律问题等。每人对于自己分担的问题，事先都作了充分的准备。在核心组主持下，先后召开了三次大讨论会，不仅有全体高级组同志参加，而且吸收自修 “中共简史”的干部参加。省委的专题发言，由于叙述的系统，分析的深刻，以及适当地联系了中国实际与本省实际，因此给参加讨论会的二百多名高、中级干部以很大的启发教育，不仅直接提高了干部在若干问题上的认识水平，而且使干部进一步学到了联系实际的方法。大家普遍反映收获很大，提高了学习兴趣，增强了学习信心。参加讨论会的高级干部回去以后，又结合本单位学习的情况，向一般干部作了传达，从而又提高了广大干部的认识。事实证明：通过这种专题发言的形式，不仅把省委的学习与高级干部和一般干部的学习结合起来，并在全体规模上提高了省直属单位广大干部学习的积极性与思想水平，同时也推动了省委本身的学习。省委为了作好专题发言，就必须深入钻研，反复思考。事实也是这样，省委的专题发言，大部分都是他们个人的学习心得，各有不同程度的独到见解，因此深受高、中级干部的欢迎。佳木斯、牡丹江、宁安等部分市、县委学习省委这种方法来领导本地区干部的学习，也收到了良好的效果。但运用这一方法时，必须以充分的小组讨论作基础，根据小组讨论中暴露出来的各种错误思想、糊涂观点，结合着进行分析批判。这样，问题解决会更深入更具体，对于干部的教育启发也会更大。
    最后，省委在学习领导上还经常地强调理论联系实际的方法对于学习的重要，强调学习时要考虑文件中的原则、结论对于我们当前革命实践的指导意义，及时发现与批判学习中的空谈、脱离实际等各种教条主义的学习偏向。学习一开始，省委即提倡首先反复钻研文件，求得融会贯通文件的精神，再联系思想、工作中的原则问题，按文件的论点展开讨论，结合解决要联系的实际问题。省委不仅在学习大会上倡导与介绍这一正确的学习方法，而且有意识地在整个学习过程中贯彻这一学习方法。如学习“矛盾论”时，少数同志专扣名词，省委书记李常青同志随即指出这种研究问题的态度是错误的，忽略了学习的目的是为了正确地指导实践，从而纠正了这种学习的偏向。省委这种谆谆善诱，密切结合实际，结合学习中暴露的问题，进行思想方法与学习方法的辅导，对干部的提高帮助很大。由于省委运用上述的方法来领导干部的学习，因此把广大干部特别是高级干部的学习逐步纳入正轨，学习情绪日趋巩固，并不断地获得成就。现在大家正满怀信心地迎接一九五三年新的学习任务。
