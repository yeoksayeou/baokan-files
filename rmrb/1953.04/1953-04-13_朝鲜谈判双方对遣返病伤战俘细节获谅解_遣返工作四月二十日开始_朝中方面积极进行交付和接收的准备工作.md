Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 12th: The Korean Armistice Negotiation Korean and Chinese delegation issued the following communique on April 12th: On the morning of April 12th, officers from both sides held a meeting to discuss the administrative details of repatriating sick and wounded prisoners of war. At the meeting, both sides reached a complete understanding on the administrative details of repatriating sick and wounded prisoners of war. Our side notified the other side that we will begin repatriating sick and wounded prisoners of war in our custody to the other side at Panmunjom on April 20th. The first group of sick and wounded prisoners of war in our custody will depart from our Tianmo POW camp on April 14th. Our side requested that the other side also begin repatriating sick and wounded prisoners of war in their custody to our side at Panmunjom on April 20th. The other side agreed.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 12th: The first convoy carrying sick and wounded prisoners of war held by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers will head south to Kaesong at 6:00 AM on Tuesday, April 14th. These prisoners of war will be repatriated to the U.S. side at Panmunjom on the 20th. This decision was communicated to the U.S. side by Korean and Chinese officers at an officers' meeting held this morning where agreement was reached on the administrative details of the repatriation work.

The first motorcade, comprising twenty-three vehicles, will arrive in Kaesong on April 16th. Each vehicle will have a square of red cloth, one meter in size, covering the vehicle roof as a marker, and will also display a red flag of the same size. Stopping points along the way will be marked with large red crosses. The agreement reached on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war guarantees that all train and vehicle movements carrying sick and wounded prisoners of war to Kaesong and Munsan, and then from those locations along the currently established attack-free routes to Panmunjom, will be free from all attacks.

The Liaison Group did not meet at Panmunjom today. Yesterday, General Li Sang-cho proposed discussing the immediate resumption of delegation meetings to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue and achieve a Korean armistice. Rear Admiral Daniel, of the U.S. Liaison Group, suggested that the Liaison Group meetings be adjourned pending notification from his liaison officer. Later, General Li Sang-cho proposed convening a meeting of the Liaison Group in a day or two to discuss the date for resuming the armistice negotiations, since the agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war had already been signed. Daniel agreed.

While the world awaits the resumption of armistice negotiations, Panmunjom is actively preparing for the handover and reception of sick and wounded prisoners of war. In the northwestern part of the conference area, visible from the conference site, personnel from the Korean and Chinese delegations are rapidly building roads and leveling uneven ground for use as reception areas. The road construction and leveling work are expected to be completed today, at which point tents can be erected to prepare for receiving the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The work of receiving Korean and Chinese prisoners of war is likely to begin on April 20th.

    朝鲜谈判双方对遣返病伤战俘细节获谅解
    遣返工作四月二十日开始
    朝中方面积极进行交付和接收的准备工作
    【新华社开城十二日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月十二日发表公报如下：四月十二日上午，双方军官举行会议，讨论遣返病伤被俘人员的行政细节问题。会上双方对遣返病伤被俘人员的行政细节达成了全部谅解。我方通知对方，我方将于四月二十日在板门店，开始将我方收容下的病伤战俘遣返对方。我方收容下的病伤战俘的第一批将在四月十四日自我方天摩战俘营启程。我方要求对方也在四月二十日开始在板门店将对方收容下的病伤被俘人员遣返我方。对方表示同意。
    【新华社开城十二日电】载运朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军手中的病伤战俘的第一支车队，将在四月十四日（星期二）上午六时向南驶往开城，这些战俘将于二十日在板门店被遣返给美方。这个决定已由朝中方面军官在今天上午举行的完成遣返工作行政细节上的谅解的军官会议上通知美方。
    包括二十三辆车子的第一支汽车车队将在四月十六日开到开城。每辆车的车盖上将覆以一块一公尺见方的红布，作为标志，并且将插着同样大小的一面红旗。沿途停留地点将标示以大的红十字。关于遣返病伤被俘人员所达成的协议保证：载运病伤战俘去开城及汶山，然后由各该地点经目前确立的免受攻击的路线去板门店的所有火车及汽车的行动，免受一切攻击。
    联络组今天没有在板门店开会。昨天，李相朝将军提议讨论立即恢复代表团会议以解决整个战俘问题和实现朝鲜停战之后，美方联络组丹尼尔海军少将建议联络组会议先行休会，以待他的联络官的通知。后来，李相朝将军提议一两天内召开联络组的会议，来讨论恢复停战谈判的日期，因为关于遣返病伤战俘的协定已经签字。丹尼尔表示同意。
    在全世界等待恢复停战谈判的时候，板门店正积极进行交付和接收病伤被俘人员的准备工作。在会场区西北部，在从会场看得到的地方，朝中代表团人员正在迅速地修筑道路，修平高低不平的地方作为接收地区。修筑道路和修平地区的工作可望在今天完成，到时就可以架起帐篷，准备接待朝中被俘人员。接待朝中被俘人员的工作可能在四月二十日开始。
