From March 16th to 29th, the reader letters group of this newspaper received a total of 4,130 letters from readers, and various agencies responded to readers with 829 letters. Among them, 2,195 were related to political and legal issues, 1,406 were related to industrial and agricultural production and financial issues, 1,260 were related to cultural and educational issues, and 98 were of other nature. Among these letters, 530 were published in this newspaper, 977 were individually answered to the readers, 2,083 were forwarded to relevant agencies for investigation, handling, reply or reference, and 1,770 were retained by this newspaper for reference and did not need further processing; some of them were previous letters. During the same period, the reader letters group of this newspaper sent out a total of 4,877 letters replying to readers, forwarding to relevant agencies for investigation and handling, and urging action. In addition, there were 692 letters from family members of revolutionary soldiers seeking revolutionary soldiers, which were not included in the statistics.

Among a large number of letters concerning marriage issues, some reported on the work situation, experiences, and lessons learned in the movement to implement the Marriage Law in various regions. Readers reflected that some cadres in Leping County, Qingjiang County, and other places in Jiangxi had impatient emotions in the early stages of implementing the Marriage Law movement, attempting to solve all problems by holding "struggle sessions" and other methods, resulting in public panic and unease; later, the local leading organs corrected the above deviations and adopted the method of conducting widespread publicity and education. These readers used specific facts to illustrate that in the movement to implement the Marriage Law, it is necessary to act in accordance with the spirit of the "Supplementary Instructions on the Work of the Marriage Law Movement Month" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in order to make the movement develop normally and effectively. We have retained these letters for reference. Many letters continue to expose the bureaucracy in current work in various aspects. In terms of industrial production, readers exposed the situation of some factories and mines not accepting workers' rationalization proposals, leading to work-related injuries; the situation of selling products that are known to be substandard, causing losses to other production units; as well as falsely reporting achievements to leading organs, fabricating labor models, and violating financial discipline. In terms of agricultural production, readers exposed the commanding style of some county and district people's governments in leading agricultural production work, as well as blindly arranging work. In terms of financial work, readers exposed the chaotic systems of some specialized companies and cooperatives, the waste and backlog of state materials; the situation of only seeking profits regardless of state policies and the people's livelihood, arbitrarily selling or purchasing materials; as well as blindly processing orders and supporting handicrafts that are not needed for the national economy and people's livelihood, resulting in product backlogs. In addition to selecting some of the above letters for public publication, we have comprehensively studied the rest and reflected them to the relevant departments in charge.

Many letters continue to expose many problems in the teaching work and administrative leadership of secondary technical schools in various regions. Many letters reflect the important problem of the blind outflow of rural labor in some areas, which affects rural production and construction. We have studied the above issues and plan to raise them publicly in the newspaper.

In the past two weeks, we have also received some letters from cadres in service who requested to transfer jobs or to have their spouses transferred to the same area due to interest, family, lifestyle habits, etc., and letters from cadres in service who requested to pursue further education; these issues must be handled by their respective agencies based on the specific circumstances. Please submit these requests directly to the leading comrades or the higher-level personnel departments of their respective agencies. Except for special circumstances, this newspaper generally does not handle them. In addition, we have forwarded letters criticizing the delays and poor hygiene of certain trains to the railway department for responsible handling; we have comprehensively reported the opinions on cadre treatment and wage system to the competent authorities; we published letters with opinions on the request to publish Russian professional technical books in the "Abstracts of Reader Letters" column on February 23, and the competent authorities are actively trying to solve it; we will no longer reply individually to letters regarding the above issues.

    两周读者来信处理的情况
    从三月十六日到二十九日，本报读者来信组共收到读者来信四千一百三十件，各机关答复读者的信八百二十九件。其中有关政法问题的二千一百九十五件，有关工农业生产和财经问题的一千四百零六件，有关文教问题的一千二百六十件，其它性质的九十八件。这些来信在本报发表的五百三十件，个别答复读者的九百七十七件，转请各有关机关调查、处理、答复或参考的二千零八十三件，留存本报参考以及不需再作处理的一千七百七十件；其中
    一部分是以前的来信。在同一时期，本报读者来信组共发出答复读者、转请有关机关调查处理和催办信四千八百七十七件。此外，还有革命军人家属寻找革命军人的信六百九十二件，数字未统计在内。
    在大量有关婚姻问题的来信中，一部分是报告各地贯彻婚姻法运动的工作情况及经验教训的。读者反映：江西乐平县、清江县等地某些干部在贯彻婚姻法运动初期曾有急躁情绪，企图用开“斗争会”等办法来解决一切问题，结果引起群众恐慌不安；后来当地领导机关纠正了上述偏向，采取了普遍进行宣传教育的办法。这些读者都用具体事实说明：在贯彻婚姻法运动中，必须要按照中共中央“关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示”的精神办事，才能使运动正常而有效地开展。这些来信，我们已留作参考。有不少来信继续揭发当前各方面工作中的官僚主义。在工业生产方面，读者揭发了某些厂矿不接受职工合理化建议以致发生工伤事故的情况；把明知不合规格的产品推销出厂以致使其他生产单位受到损失的情况；以及向领导机关虚报成绩、假造劳动模范和违反财政纪律等情况。在农业生产方面，读者揭发了某些县区人民政府领导农业生产工作中的强迫命令作风以及盲目布置工作的情况。在财经工作方面，读者揭发了某些专业公司和合作社制度混乱，浪费和积压国家物资的情况；不顾国家政策和群众生活而只图营利，任意抛售或收购物资的情况；以及盲目加工订货、扶植不为国民生计所需的手工业，以致造成产品积压的情况。以上来信，我们除选择一部分公开发表外，其余都分别综合研究并向各主管部门反映。
    不少来信继续揭发了目前各地中等技术学校教学工作和行政领导上的很多问题。不少来信反映了目前某些地区农村劳动力盲目外流影响农村生产建设的重要问题。我们研究了上述问题，准备在报上公开提出。
    这两周中，我们还收到一些在职干部因兴趣、家庭、生活习惯等原因要求调动工作或要求把爱人调到同一地区工作的来信和在职干部要求升学的来信；这类问题必须由他们所在机关根据具体情况来处理，请上述读者直接向所在机关领导同志或上级人事部门提出，除特殊情况外，本报一般不作处理。此外，批评某次列车误点和卫生情况不好的来信，我们都已转请铁道部门负责处理；对干部待遇和工资制度的意见，我们已综合汇报主管机关；要求出版俄文专业技术书籍的意见，我们曾在二月二十三日“读者来信摘要”栏发表过这方面意见的来信，主管部门正在积极设法解决；有关以上问题的来信，我们不再作个别答复。
