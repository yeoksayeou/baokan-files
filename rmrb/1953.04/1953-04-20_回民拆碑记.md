Record of Hui People Dismantling a Stele

In March, a significant event occurred in Guilin City. On the morning of the 6th, six hundred Hui people from the entire city, supporting the old and leading the young, marched in formation, led by the bands from the Muslim and Qingzhen Elementary Schools, to the cemetery of Cen Yuying, the Qing Dynasty Governor-General. There, they held a grand gathering to dismantle the reactionary stone stele that insulted the Hui people. A car also proceeded slowly in the procession; this was specially hired by the Guilin City Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to transport dozens of elderly and frail Hui people. People appeared so excited that even the blind Bai Yulin and Zhang Longling put on new clothes to join; the eighty-year-old Imam Huangfu Jingzhi said, "We have never had such good days in our entire lives!"

Speaking of Cen Yuying, many Hui people would tearfully accuse him of his heinous crimes. It was during the Qing Dynasty that the Hui people in various parts of Yunnan Province, unable to bear the oppression of the reactionary rule, launched the Hui people's uprising led by Du Wenxiu. Although the Qing court mobilized a large number of troops to "suppress" it, this just struggle, mainly composed of Hui people and united with other fraternal ethnic groups, lasted for sixteen years. Cen Yuying was the executioner who "suppressed" this uprising, and he slaughtered Hui people and other minority ethnic groups in the uprising army's garrison areas. After his death, he was buried in Yaoshan, Guilin City, and three stone steles were erected in front of his tomb, inscribed with the Qing Emperor's praise for his "meritorious service" in massacring the Hui people of Yunnan. For many years, minority peoples lived under national oppression and discrimination, swallowing their anger, until after liberation when they gained the right to national equality. Last year, after seeing the Central People's Government's directive on handling steles insulting minority nationalities across the country, the Hui people of Guilin City immediately requested the Guilin City Committee of the CPC and the Municipal People's Government to dismantle the stele. When the Guilin City Committee of the CPC launched the study and publicity of national policies in February this year, it convened representatives from all walks of life in the Hui community to discuss this issue. At the meeting, everyone decided to gather the masses on a scheduled date to dismantle the stone stele.

When these reactionary inscriptions were removed, the Hui people present could not help but cheer in unison.

Having already enjoyed the warmth of the family of all nationalities, the Hui people deeply understand that the national oppression left over from thousands of years, like these reactionary steles insulting minority nationalities, has gradually been eradicated from the land of the motherland!

    回民拆碑记
    三月里，桂林市发生了一件大事。六号那天一清早，全市六百多回民扶老携幼地排着队，由穆士林、清真两小学校的乐队领头，到满清总督岑毓英的坟场去。他们到那里举行盛大的集会，拆除侮辱回民的反动石碑。一辆汽车也在行列里缓缓行进，这是中国共产党桂林市委员会特地雇来接送几十位年老体弱的回民的。人们显得多么激动，连瞎眼的白裕林、张龙玲也换上新衣赶来参加了；八十多岁的皇甫敬芝阿訇说：“我们一辈子也没有过这样好的日子呀！”
    提起岑毓英，很多回民都会声泪俱下地控诉着他的滔天罪恶。那是在满清时代，云南省各地回族人民因不堪反动统治的压迫，举行了以杜文秀为首的回民起义。虽然满清朝廷调动了大批兵马去“镇压”，但这个以回族为主联合其他各兄弟民族的正义斗争，一直坚持了十六年之久。岑毓英便是“镇压”这次起义的刽子手，他大肆杀害起义军驻地的回民和其他少数民族。他死后葬在桂林市尧山，墓前立有三块石碑，刻着满清皇帝夸奖他屠杀云南回民的“功劳”。多少年来，少数民族人民在民族压迫和歧视下，忍气吞声地生活着，直到解放以后才获得民族平等的权利。去年，桂林市回民看到中央人民政府政务院关于处理全国各地侮辱少数民族碑碣的指示以后，马上向中共桂林市委和市人民政府提出了拆碑的要求。中共桂林市委在今年二月发动全市学习和宣传民族政策时，便召集回民各界代表座谈了这个问题。会上，大家决议定期集合群众去拆除碑石。
    当拆除这些反动碑记的时候，在场的回民不禁齐声欢呼着。
    已经享受到各族大家庭温暖的回族人民，深切地懂得那千百年遗留下来的民族压迫，像这些侮辱少数民族的反动碑石一样，已经逐渐从祖国的大地上连根铲除！    （新华社）
