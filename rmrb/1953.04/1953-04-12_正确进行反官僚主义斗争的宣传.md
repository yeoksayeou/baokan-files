	Propaganda for Correctly Conducting the Anti-Bureaucracy Struggle

The propaganda of the anti-bureaucracy struggle has been widely launched in local newspapers. At present, the propaganda in various newspapers shows the following two basic characteristics:

First, most newspapers have exposed some typical events, arousing people's vigilance and attention, and have initially mobilized the masses to launch criticism from the bottom up. For example, after the Hebei Daily exposed the "Taidi Village Incident," leading organs and leading cadres at all levels studied the incident in connection with it, and implemented the anti-bureaucracy struggle from top to bottom, starting with this incident. The broad masses also actively participated in exposing bureaucracy and bad people and bad deeds. By the beginning of March, the newspaper had exposed more than a dozen typical events, including the serious waste in water conservancy construction caused by bureaucracy in the Hebei Provincial Department of Water Conservancy, and the major events of Zhang Xin, a member of the Baoding Prefectural Committee, concealing illegal and disciplinary violations and falsely accusing whistleblowers, all of which were exposed by the masses. The Shandong Dazhong Daily also seized on typical events such as the "Violation of Law and Discipline by Cadres in Zhao Wangtang Village, Jining" and the "Maggot Death of Patient Zhang Kejing in Kangfu Hospital" to deeply expose the evils of bureaucracy and encourage the masses to participate in the anti-bureaucracy struggle. Some newspapers have not only exposed typical events, but also further launched ideological criticism. For example, after exposing the "Huang Yifeng Incident," the Shanghai Jiefang Daily, in response to the regretful emotions of some cadres and masses due to Huang Yifeng's "history" and "merits," systematically analyzed and criticized Huang Yifeng's anti-Party behavior, educating people to further understand why suppressing criticism is a serious crime and why people who suppress criticism must be regarded as the enemy of the Party. Another example is the Northeast Daily. When publishing the Anshan Municipal Party Committee's review of restricting newspaper criticism, it also published an editorial, deeply criticizing the erroneous views of some responsible and relatively responsible cadres who believed that "internal solutions are better than public criticism," and expounded why public criticism in newspapers and periodicals is particularly important today.

Second, after initially launching mass criticism, many newspapers have begun to further deepen the propaganda of the anti-bureaucracy struggle in combination with their work. For example, after criticizing the "Overstocking of Woolen Clothing Incident," the Northeast Daily recently published continuous commentaries targeting the formalism bias in the local industrial and mining discussion of national production plans and the poor preparation work of the capital construction departments, proposing the issues of opposing bureaucracy, earnestly mobilizing the masses to discuss national plans, and conducting in-depth inspections of capital construction preparation work. The Tianjin Daily also conducted criticism based on the local reality, focusing on typical false concealment events in the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry system and the event of the former North China Livestock Products Company's Meat Department losing all its funds, combined with current work, and mobilized the masses to launch criticism and discussion. The Hebei Daily recently also launched criticism of bureaucracy and commandism in spring plowing production.

However, some newspapers still lack clear goals in their propaganda, and tend to carry out the anti-bureaucracy struggle in isolation from current work. After launching criticism from the bottom up, these newspapers still remain on the exposure of suppressing criticism, or publish too many old problems that are irrelevant to current work. For example, the struggle against ignoring people's letters and suppressing criticism launched by the New Hainan Daily since November of last year has powerfully promoted the development of criticism from the bottom up in the Hainan area, and made a work summary in late January, but the newspaper did not further deepen the anti-bureaucracy struggle on the basis of this struggle until March 23, and still exposed some phenomena of suppressing criticism and problems unrelated to current work without any boundaries, some of which are even lacking in thought and criticisms of trivial matters in life. For example, the incident of Chen Bin, the leader of the organizing and guiding section of the Hainan Cooperative General Agency, smearing the blackboard newspaper criticism manuscript, which was exposed by the newspaper on February 27, was not a typical bureaucratic event, but the newspaper launched a discussion based on this as a typical example. There was no clear ideological goal in the discussion, but a lot of old accounts or trivial matters were put forward without any boundaries. The Party Central Committee clearly pointed out in its instructions on opposing bureaucracy that the anti-bureaucracy struggle must be closely combined with various tasks. Therefore, we must earnestly follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee in our propaganda and reports, grasp this basic link, select major typical events with universal educational significance that can promote current work, and carry out propaganda steadily and actively in combination with criticism of daily work.

Some newspapers also do not use the weapon of criticism accurately and powerfully enough. This is also reflected in two aspects: weakness and impatience.

A small number of newspapers in some regions (except for newspapers in ethnic minority regions due to special circumstances) still have quite serious weakness in the propaganda of the anti-bureaucracy struggle. The content exposed and criticized by these newspapers is more about trivial matters and less about major issues; sometimes, although relatively major events are exposed, they are only simple exposures, lacking analysis and criticism. For example, when the Jiangxi Daily exposed the serious suppression of criticism by Chen Ying, the former county head of Guangfeng County, and others on February 22, they did not dare to directly criticize the leaders of the Shangrao Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office who condoned Chen Ying, and only lightly described "condoning" as "not comprehensive enough understanding" in the editorial, saying: "In our organization, some comrades still have a kind of not comprehensive enough understanding, often thinking that some cadres who have committed the above errors have 'merits' in the past, and therefore are somewhat condoned in their handling, which is not right." Due to the existence of this weakness, the newspaper's criticism becomes painless and unable to solve the problem. The editorial departments of these newspapers must further overcome this weakness.

But on the other hand, some newspapers have shown impatience in launching criticism. After the masses were mobilized and the door to bottom-up criticism was opened, some newspaper editorial departments were not calm enough. They hoped to publish all readers' criticisms, regardless of the size of the matter, and even, on the pretext that only 5% to 10% of the criticisms from the masses are correct, no longer conduct the most basic investigations and studies and realistic analysis, and hastily publish them. As a result, some superficial, fragmented, and weak criticisms, as well as inappropriate criticisms, have also appeared in these newspapers. For example, the recent criticisms published by the Qingdao Daily criticizing the Shandong University Hospital for being irresponsible in diagnosing Tian Xinli's illness and criticizing the Loushan District Police Station for illegally detaining Wang Kongdong are not in line with the facts in terms of basic content. This shows that the newspaper editorial department must truly be independently responsible for criticism, not just publishing whatever criticism comes, but should select and be responsible for clarifying the facts, making the right and wrong appropriate, and then publishing. This can not only make the criticized people convinced and truly achieve the effect of criticism, but also is a prerequisite for the newspaper to be independently responsible for criticism. If the newspaper does not do this, but only criticizes hastily, it is easy to make the criticism untrue, resulting in losses to the Party newspaper and affecting the development of bottom-up criticism. Therefore, the newspaper editorial department must correctly lead the enthusiasm of the masses on the basis of cherishing the enthusiasm of the masses for criticism. This is to be good at conducting investigations and studies, selecting typical examples, to strengthen the role of criticism in promoting practical struggles and raising the awareness of the people. Only in this way can we "progress from individual commentaries to more profound criticism, and from profound criticism to generalizing the results of criticism, showing what achievements we have gained in construction as a result of criticism." ("Stalin on Criticism and Self-Criticism," page 34, People's Publishing House)

As a result of launching criticism and self-criticism, our newspapers have become more active and lively newspapers in the anti-bureaucracy struggle; our newspapers have greatly strengthened their connection with the masses and better played their role as a powerful assistant to the Party. The Party committees in some regions have also strengthened their leadership over newspaper work. For example, the propaganda departments of the Northeast Bureau, the Central South Bureau, and the Shandong Branch Bureau, and the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, etc., have adopted methods such as convening newspaper work conferences and inspecting newspapers to study and instruct how newspapers should carry out propaganda on the anti-bureaucracy struggle. These are all favorable conditions for newspapers to continue to vigorously carry out this propaganda. Local newspapers should conduct an inspection of the anti-bureaucracy reports in the previous period, so that criticism and self-criticism in the newspapers can be persisted in regularly and correctly.

### 正确进行反官僚主义斗争的宣传

专栏：报纸工作述评

    正确进行反官僚主义斗争的宣传
    各地报纸反对官僚主义斗争的宣传，已经普遍展开。目前各报在这一宣传中表现有以下两个基本特点：
    第一，多数报纸已揭发了一些典型事件，引起人们的警惕和重视，并初步发动群众展开了自下而上的批评。例如河北日报揭发“台底村事件”后，各级领导机关和领导干部都联系这一事件进行了学习，并以此事为开端从上而下地贯彻了反官僚主义斗争。广大群众也积极参加了对官僚主义和坏人坏事的揭发。到三月初旬为止，该报已揭发的典型事件就有十多起，其中如河北省水利厅因官僚主义毛病所造成的水利建设中的严重浪费现象，保定地委委员张馨等隐瞒违法乱纪罪行、诬告检举者等重大事件，都是群众所揭发的。山东大众日报也抓住
  “济宁赵王堂村干部违法乱纪事件”和“康复医院病人张克敬生蛆死亡事件”等典型事件，深刻揭露了官僚主义的恶行，并鼓舞了群众参加反官僚主义斗争的积极性。有些报纸不仅揭发了典型事件，而且进一步展开思想批判。例如上海解放日报在揭发“黄逸峰事件”后，曾针对某些干部群众因黄逸峰有“历史”有“功绩”而产生的惋惜情绪，较为系统地分析和批判了黄逸峰的反党行为，教育人们进一步认识：何以压制批评是严重的罪行，以及为什么必须把压制批评的人看作党的死敌。再如东北日报在发表鞍山市委关于限制报纸批评的检讨时，同时发表社论，深入批判了某些负责的和较为负责的干部认为“内部解决比公开批评好”等错误观点，阐述了何以在报刊上进行公开批评在今天特别重要的道理。
    第二，不少报纸在初步展开群众性的批评后，已开始结合工作进一步深入反官僚主义斗争的宣传。例如东北日报在批判了“绒衣积压事件”后，最近又针对当地工矿讨论国家生产计划中的形式主义偏向和基本建设部门准备工作做得不好的情况，连续发表评论，提出反对官僚主义、认真发动群众讨论国家计划和深入检查基本建设准备工作的问题。天津日报也根据当地实际情况，以天津市工业局系统中的典型虚假隐瞒事件和原华北畜产公司肉食部资金赔光事件为中心，结合当前工作，进行批评，并发动群众展开了批判和讨论。河北日报最近并对春耕生产中的官僚主义和命令主义展开批评。
    但还有部分报纸宣传的目标不够明确，有离开当前工作孤立进行反官僚主义斗争的倾向。这些报纸在展开自下而上的批评后，仍然停留在对压制批评现象的揭发上，或者过多地刊登那些与当前工作无关的老问题。例如新海南报从去年十一月以来展开的反对漠视人民来信和压制批评的斗争，曾有力地推动了海南地区自下而上批评的开展，并在一月下旬作了工作总结，但该报直至三月二十三日为止，并没有在这一斗争的基础上，紧密结合各项工作进一步深入反官僚主义斗争，仍然在毫无边际地揭发一些压制批评的现象及与当前工作无关的问题，其中有些甚至是缺乏思想的、生活琐事的批评。如该报在二月二十七日揭发的海南合作总社组导股长陈斌涂抹黑板报批评稿的事件，并不是一个典型的官僚主义事件，该报却以此为典型展开讨论，在讨论中也没有明确的思想目标，而是毫无边际地摆出了很多老账或琐事。党中央在反对官僚主义的指示中曾明确指出，反官僚主义斗争必须密切结合各项工作来进行。因此，我们在宣传报道上必须切实遵照党中央的指示，抓住这个基本环节，选择重大的具有普遍教育意义而又能推动当前工作的典型事件，结合对日常工作的批评，稳步而积极地进行宣传。
    也有一些报纸运用批评的武器不够准确有力。这也表现在两方面，就是软弱和急躁。
    少数地区的报纸（除少数民族地区的报纸因情况特殊外），在反官僚主义斗争的宣传上还存在着相当严重的软弱病。这些报纸所揭发和批评的内容，是琐碎的事情多，重大的问题少；有时虽然揭发了较为重大的事件，但也只是单纯的暴露，缺乏分析批判。例如江西日报二月二十二日揭发广丰县前县长陈英等严重压制批评的事件时，对姑息纵容陈英的上饶地委和专署领导干部不敢正面批评，仅在社论中把“姑息纵容”轻描淡写地说成是“不够全面的认识”，说什么：“在我们组织中，有些同志尚存在着一种不够全面的认识，往往对犯有以上错误的一些干部，认为他们过去有‘功劳’，因而在处理上有些姑息，这是不对的。”由于这种软弱病的存在，报纸的批评就变成不痛不痒，不能解决问题。这些报纸的编辑部必须进一步克服这种软弱病。
    但在另一方面，有些报纸在展开批评中又表现了急躁情绪。在群众发动起来、自下而上批评的大门打开以后，有些报纸编辑部表现不够冷静。他们希望把所有读者的批评，不分事情大小都刊登出来，甚至藉口来自群众的批评只要百分之五到百分之十是正确的，就不再进行起码的调查研究和实事求是的分析，而轻率地加以发表。于是一些浮光掠影、零碎无力的批评，以及是非不适当的批评，也在这些报纸上出现了。例如青岛日报近来发表的批评山东大学医院诊断田新利的病不负责任、批评楼山区派出所非法扣押王孔东等稿件，在基本内容上就不符事实。这说明报纸编辑部要真正作到对批评独立负责，并不是来什么批评就发表什么批评，而是应该加以选择，并且负责弄清事实，作到是非适当，然后再行发表。这不仅可以使被批评者口服心服，真正达到批评的实效，而且是报纸独立负责进行批评的先决条件。如果报纸不这样作，而只是急急忙忙地加以批评，那就很容易使批评失实，而招致党报的损失，并影响自下而上批评的展开。因此，报纸编辑部必须在十分珍视群众批评积极性的基础上，对群众的这种积极性加以正确的领导。这就是要善于进行调查研究，选择典型，以加强批评对推动实际斗争和提高人民群众觉悟的作用。只有这样才能“从个别的评述进到比较深刻的批评，而从深刻的批评进到概括批评底结果，表明由于批评底结果我们建设方面获得了什么样的成绩。”（“斯大林论批评与自我批评”，第三十四页，人民出版社）
    由于展开批评和自我批评的结果，我们的报纸在反官僚主义斗争中已经成为更加活跃和生动的报纸；我们的报纸已大大加强了与群众的联系，并更好地发挥了作为党的有力助手的作用。有些地区的党委也加强了对报纸工作的领导，如东北局、中南局、山东分局的宣传部门和天津市委等，曾采取召开报纸工作会议和检查报纸等方式，研究并指示了报纸应如何进行反官僚主义斗争的宣传。这些都是报纸继续大力展开这一宣传的有利条件。各地报纸应该对前一时期的反官僚主义报道进行一次检查，使报纸上的批评和自我批评能够经常地、正确地坚持下去。
