Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th: Since February, the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Small Rolling Mill have put forward more than 90 proposals related to mechanization and automation. Among them, five items have been adopted and implemented: automatic material conveying and loading equipment for heating furnaces, automatic lifting equipment for coiling machine reels, automatic conveying equipment for coiled finished products, automatic small shears on the cooling bed, and automatic baffles in front of the runway. The implementation of these suggestions has played a significant role in increasing production and improving the harsh working conditions left over from the enemy and puppet regimes. For example, after adding the automatic material conveying and loading device for the heating furnace, not only were six workers per shift reduced in the heating process, but the workers no longer had to operate behind the furnace frequently in high temperatures. Due to the implementation of the above five suggestions, the heating furnace section, one of the four main sections of the entire plant, has been fully automated.

The methods used by the leadership of the Small Rolling Mill in the mechanization and automation movement are: First, they pay close attention to guiding workers to collectively research and create together. For example, the five pieces of equipment that have been successfully improved or are being improved, such as the automatic lifting device for coiling machine reels, were all successfully researched and created by many workers and technicians together. Second, they seize key points to mobilize employees to put forward rationalization proposals. For example, the overturning and tapping of steel in the heating furnace have been automated, but the loading and conveying of steel have not yet been automated, so workers sometimes still have to suffer from fatigue and heat. In order to solve this problem, the plant's rationalization proposal team mobilized everyone to actively put forward suggestions in this regard, and as a result, the automatic material conveying and loading device for the heating furnace was created.

Currently, the mechanization and automation movement of the Small Rolling Mill is still continuing to develop.

    鞍钢小型轧钢厂加热炉工段全部自动化
    【新华社沈阳九日电】鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂的职工在二月以来，又提出有关机械化、自动化的建议九十多件。其中已采纳实行的有加热炉自动运料和装入设备、卷线机卷盘自动起落设备、卷线成品自动运送设备、冷床上的自动小剪以及跑道前的自动挡板等五项。这几项建议的实现，对于提高生产、改善敌伪遗留下来的恶劣劳动条件都起了重大作用。如加热炉自动运料和装入装置增设以后，不仅使加热工序每班减少了六个人工，而且使工人不必经常冒着高温在炉后操作了。由于推行了上述五项建议，全厂四个主要工段之一的加热炉工段就全部自动化了。
    小型轧钢厂领导机械化、自动化运动的方法是：第一，非常注意引导工人集体研究、共同创造。如已经改进成功或正在改进的卷线机卷盘自动起落装置等五项设备，都是许多工人、技术人员在一起研究创造成功的。第二，抓住关键发动职工提合理化建议。譬如加热炉翻钢、掏钢都自动化了，但装钢和运钢还没自动化，因而工人有时还要受累、挨烤。为解决这一问题，该厂合理化建议小组发动大家积极提出这方面的建议，结果创造了加热炉自动运料和装入装置。
    目前小型轧钢厂的机械化、自动化运动仍在继续发展中。
