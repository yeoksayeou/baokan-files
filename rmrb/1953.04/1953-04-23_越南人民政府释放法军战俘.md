    Xinhua News Agency, 19th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Resistance Administrative Committee of the Third Interzone of Vietnam, in implementing the humane policy of the Vietnamese People's Government regarding the lenient treatment of prisoners of war, released fourteen European and African prisoners of war on March 1st. These released prisoners of war have arrived at the enemy strongholds of Lac Dao, Noi Co, and Thanh Po near Ha Noi in Ha Dong province. Along the way, they sang Vietnamese songs such as "Long Live President Ho Chi Minh" and "We Love Peace."
    In Thanh Po, a platoon of European and African soldiers came out of the stronghold to greet them and held a short demonstration with them against the "dirty war." In Lac Dao, they were similarly welcomed by European and African soldiers. The French commander of the stronghold, fearing that this would have a bad influence on the morale of the garrison, quickly sent them to Van Dinh by car.

    越南人民政府释放法军战俘
    【新华社十九日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南第三联区抗战行政委员会执行越南人民政府宽待俘虏的人道主义的政策，在三月一日释放了十四名欧非籍战俘。这些被释放的战俘已经到达河内附近河东省的乐道、内孤、清坡敌军据点。他们沿路歌唱“胡志明主席万岁”“我们爱和平”等越南歌曲。
    在清坡，欧非籍士兵一个排走出据点迎接他们，并和他们举行一个反对“肮脏战争”的短的示威。在乐道，他们同样受到欧非籍士兵的欢迎。该据点的法国指挥官害怕这样会对驻军的士气产生坏的影响，连忙用汽车把他们送到文定去。
