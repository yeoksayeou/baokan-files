Shaanxi and Liaoxi Provincial Water Bureaus Blindly Manufacture Unsuitable Waterwheels
A letter from Gao Rushan of the General Irrigation Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources: In 1951 and 1952, the water bureaus of Shaanxi and Liaoxi provinces blindly manufactured and promoted water-lifting tools that did not meet the needs of the masses, causing huge losses to state property and creating a negative impact among the masses. In 1951, Yang Xiaochu, Director of the Planning Bureau of the Northwest Finance and Economics Committee, proposed using farmers' cotton gins equipped with four parts: water pipes, chains, sprockets, and water scoops, as water-lifting tools to draw well water. The Shaanxi Provincial Water Bureau, without careful consideration or thorough testing, blindly manufactured more than 9,000 sets. Because the waterwheels were inefficient and manufacturers cut corners and produced them shoddily, the Water Bureau did not conduct strict inspections but hastily accepted them, the masses generally refused to use them, and only 400 sets were loaned out in one year. In the same year, the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Department's Farm Implement Factory designed and manufactured more than 1,800 hand-cranked and foot-pedaled waterwheels, and the Shaanxi Provincial Water Bureau loaned out 938 units in 1951 and 1952. The water level in the wells in the Shaanxi area is mostly above two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters), so it is laborious and produces little water to use these manual waterwheels. The masses do not welcome them, and those who have been loaned them are asking to return them. Now, the above-mentioned waterwheels are piled up in the Shaanxi Provincial Water Bureau's square. Except for a small number of parts that can be modified for use as parts for pipe waterwheels, most can only be treated as scrap, with an estimated loss of 6.5 billion RMB.

In 1952, the Liaoxi Provincial Water Bureau did not conduct in-depth investigations and careful tests. Based only on the calculations of technicians on paper, the funds that could have been used to manufacture more than 800 Liberation-style waterwheels were used to manufacture 950 double-headed Yang wells (hand-operated pumps with two cylinders) and loaned them to farmers for irrigation. After the farmers installed the double-headed Yang wells, eight out of ten did not produce water, and those that could produce water required four people to take turns, and at most, they could only irrigate half a mu (approximately 0.03 hectares) after working hard for a long time. Although Liaoxi suffered a drought last year, more than 700 double-headed Yang wells were not used, and those that were used were only for drinking water or spraying medicine to treat diseases and insect pests. Some people said, "It's not that we don't want to use them, but the Yang wells can't be used." Others said, "Yang wells are useless."

### 陕西、辽西两省水利局盲目制造不适用的水车

    陕西、辽西两省水利局盲目制造不适用的水车
    中央水利部灌溉总局高如山来信：陕西与辽西两省水利局在一九五一、一九五二两年中盲目制造与推广不合群众需要的提水工具，使国家财富遭受巨大损失，并在群众中造成不良影响。一九五一年西北财经委员会计划局杨效初局长提出利用农民的轧花机配置水管、链子、链轮及水簸箕四种零件作提水工具来汲取井水的办法。陕西省水利局未作周密考虑与慎重试验，即盲目地制造了九千多套。由于这种水车汲水效能过低，加以承制厂商偷工减料，粗制滥造，水利局亦未予以严格检查而草率验收，因此群众普遍拒绝使用，一年内仅贷出了四百套。同年，西北农林部农具工厂设计制造了手摇式与脚踏式水车一千八百多部，陕西省水利局在一九五一、一九五二两年中贷出了九百三十八部。陕西地区的井水位大多在二丈以上，使用这种人力水车费力大而出水少，群众很不欢迎，已经贷出的纷纷要求退贷。现在上述几种水车都堆积在陕西省水利局的广场上。其中除小部分零件尚能改装为管子水车的零件使用外，绝大部分只能当作废料处理，估计损失达人民币六十五亿元。
    辽西省水利局在一九五二年未作深入调查研究和慎重试验，只凭技术人员纸面上的计算，就把可以制造八百多部解放式水车的经费制造了九百五十台双头洋井（两个筒的手压唧筒）贷给农民用来浇地。农民把双头洋井安装起来后，十个有八个不出水，能压出水的也须四个人轮着干，累了半天最多浇半亩地。去年辽西虽然遭旱，但双头洋井却有七百多台没有用起来，用了的也只是为了吃水或打药水治病虫害。有的群众说：“不是我们不想用，而是洋井不能用”。有的说：“洋井是废物。”
