A State-Owned Company That Couldn't Pay Its Debts Even If It Sold All Its Inventory
By our special correspondent Chen Xin

    The former Northeast Branch of the China Industrial Equipment Company (hereinafter referred to as the Northeast Industrial Equipment Company) had over 400 billion yuan worth of slow-moving and unsalable goods in stock and over 1.4 trillion yuan in working capital that should have been transferred but was not. The interest paid to the bank accounted for 53.52% of the entire commodity circulation cost. It is said that even if the company sold all its existing inventory, it would not be enough to repay the bank credit. Why is the problem so serious? How is the company managed?

    Irresponsible and Blind Management
    Railway springs were originally exclusively used by the railway department and were directly contracted by the Northeast industrial sector and the railway department as state-allocated materials for non-commodity production. In 1951, the Northeast industrial sector produced a batch of substandard and poor-quality railway springs, which were shipped to Tianjin. When the railway department rejected them, the industrial sector shipped them back to Shenyang and asked the Northeast Industrial Equipment Company to purchase them. Without asking any questions, the company purchased 7,000 sets of these railway springs, worth over 134 billion yuan, and shipped them back to Tianjin to sell, but they have been stuck in inventory ever since. The company also purchased a batch of carbon black, which was unsalable due to its gray-white color, lack of luster, and low quality, tying up 30.8 billion yuan in funds and accumulating for more than a year. Among the various commodities that the company has accumulated over the years, chemical industrial raw materials alone account for 53% of the total value of commodity inventory.

    In April 1951, the company also blindly purchased 620 pieces of cotton yarn, 288 pieces of curtain cloth, and 2,700 sets of large and small toilet fixtures, worth 11.8 billion yuan, which were outside its business scope. After purchasing these commodities outside its business scope, the company neither contacted companies that dealt with these commodities nor actively tried to sell them, leaving them stacked in the warehouse untouched for two years.

    In 1952, with the approval of the former Northeast Trade Department, the company purchased 2,650 tons of caustic soda at a purchase price of 12 million yuan per ton. However, the market selling price in Northeast China was only 10.26 million yuan, resulting in a loss of over 5.3 billion yuan after adding transportation and storage costs. According to statistics, losses from only five commodities, including hardened oil, glycerin, stearic acid, calcium carbide, and caustic soda, amounted to 46 billion yuan in 1952.

    The company's blind allocation of goods was also alarming. They allocated marine binoculars, dyes, and streetcar wires to Heilongjiang Province, which is thousands of miles from the sea and has no dye factories or streetcars. The company's warehousing management was also chaotic. Silicon steel sheets were rusted, 30% of the electrical porcelain bottles were damaged, and good steel was mixed with scrap iron. The list goes on and on. In sales, seamless steel pipes were sold as ordinary steel pipes, high-speed steel was sold as water steel, and electrical wires were sold by the "coil" at the "kilogram" price or the "roll" at the "pound" price.

    The variety, specifications, and quality of industrial equipment commodities are indeed more complex than general commodities, but some comrades in the company did not fully recognize this and adopted a nonchalant attitude. Others especially emphasized the complexity of the work and did not actively overcome difficulties, always using "I am an amateur and do not understand the business" as an excuse when problems arose. Everyone lacked the spirit of studying the business, resulting in long-term chaos in the company's management.

    Extremely Chaotic Financial Management
    The company's financial management was extremely chaotic. They often paid for goods in advance or overpaid. From April 1, 1951, to August 31, 1952, the working capital tied up due to advance payments (excluding reasonable deposits paid for processing orders) followed by failure to pick up goods in a timely manner or failure to pick up goods at all averaged 4 billion yuan per day from Anshan Iron and Steel Company alone, with the highest amount reaching over 39.9 billion yuan. Anshan Iron and Steel Company once returned 32 billion yuan to the company. The company would pay pre-purchase funds before buying any goods, regardless of whether the factory had them in stock or not, and without signing a sales contract. During the same period, refunds of this nature from Anshan Iron and Steel Company amounted to 10 billion yuan. In 1951, Benxi Coal and Iron Company sold gun steel for 20,526 yuan per kilogram, while the company paid 41,576 yuan per kilogram, and only recovered the overpayment after the "Three-Anti" campaign in 1952.

    The company's waste of working capital in promotional work was also very serious: After the company's goods were sold, it often did not know what was sold or how much was sold due to chaotic financial records. Because the shipping documents did not accompany the goods, it often took a long time to get the money back, and the money that was recovered was often not immediately entered into the accounts, resulting in a large amount of "false advance receipts." This "false advance receipt" amounted to 1.25 trillion yuan in the third quarter of 1952. In March 1951, the company sold 481 boxes of medicine worth 22 billion yuan to the Northeast Branch of the China Pharmaceutical Company, and for more than a year, it neither transferred the accounts nor asked for the money, simply forgetting about it. It was not until the Northeast Pharmaceutical Company checked the accounts at the company during last year's "Three-Anti" movement that this matter was discovered. However, the company still did not actively deal with it at this time, dragging it on until the third quarter of last year before transferring the accounts. At the end of 1952, the company's working capital that should have been settled but was not accounted for 29.94% of the total capital and more than 40% of the total commodity inventory.

    The losses caused by inconsistent commodity names, different specifications, and inconsistent units on the books were also serious and widespread. The same commodity was calculated in tons, kilograms, pounds, pieces, sets, dozens, reams, bundles, ties, roots, sheets, blocks, and boxes. What was serious was that this unit was used when buying, and that unit was used when selling. Everyone could arbitrarily name commodities, specify specifications, and set units, causing serious discrepancies between goods and accounts, discrepancies between accounts, and various forms of capital waste and commodity accumulation in which purchased and sold goods could not be entered into the accounts. Therefore, the company began to clear its inventory in the second and third quarters of last year, and listed it as a central task in the fourth quarter of last year, but to this day, it is still unclear and has not been cleared, and it has had to postpone the Northeast Commercial Bureau's regulations for verifying funds in the first quarter of this year to the second quarter.

    Higher-Level Leadership Also Has Responsibility
    In addition to the Northeast Industrial Equipment Company bearing the primary responsibility for causing the above-mentioned serious problems, the former Northeast Trade Department's blind instruction to the company in 1951 to acquire stagnant materials worth several hundred billion yuan from more than 170 factories and mines under the former Northeast Industrial Department, the former China Industrial Equipment Company's blind allocation of more than 90 billion yuan to the company in 1951 of eight commodities such as n-butanol, sodium chlorate, and antifreeze, which were accumulating nationwide, and the allocation of 13 billion yuan of zinc ingots to the Northeast in June 1952, which had already accumulated, especially the former Northeast Trade Department and the former China Industrial Equipment Company's lack of serious supervision and inspection of the chaotic state of the company's management, and their failure to help it improve, should also bear important responsibility.

    This state of blind management and chaos in financial management should not continue to exist. Now, the Northeast Industrial Equipment Company has been reorganized into three companies: Machinery and Hardware, Chemical Raw Materials, and Transportation and Electrical Equipment. These companies must regard the seriously irresponsible and blindly managed supply system mentality as the biggest enemy in their work. On the basis of clearing assets, catching up with accounts, reconciling accounts, eliminating commercial credit, handling profits and losses, and doing a good job in the 1952 final accounts, they must quickly and seriously verify funds, and thoroughly overcome the supply system management mentality and implement an economic accounting system through the supervision of state bank fund allocations and liquidations, so as to withdraw funds from improved management and invest them in national economic construction.

    一个把全部库存商品卖光也不够还账的国营公司
    本报特约记者  陈新
    原中国工业器材公司东北区公司（以下简称东北工业器材公司）积压着长年滞销的商品达四千余亿元，搁置着应该转账而未转账的流动资金一万四千余亿元。该公司付给银行的利息，竟占整个商品流转费用百分之五十三点五二。据说，该公司把现有全部库存商品卖光，也不够偿还银行信贷额数。问题为什么会这样严重呢？该公司是怎样经营的呢？
    不负责任，盲目经营
    火车弹簧本来是铁道部门专用的东西，由东北工业部门与铁道部门直接签订合同，作为非商品生产的国家调拨物资。一九五一年，东北工业部门生产了一批不合规格，质量不好的火车弹簧，运到天津后，铁道部门不要，工业部门就运回沈阳，要求东北工业器材公司收购，该公司不问青红皂白，先后收购了这种火车弹簧七千组，价值一百三十四亿余元，又运到天津去卖，但一直积压到现在还未翻身。该公司还采购了一批炭黑，因色灰白、无光泽、品质低，销售不出去，搁置资金三百零八亿元，积压时间达一年多。该公司长年累月积压的若干商品中，仅化学工业原料就占整个商品库存总值的百分之五十三。
    一九五一年四月，该公司还盲目采购了非自己经营范围内的棉纱六二○件，廉子布二八八件，大小便器二千七百套，价值一百一十八亿元。该公司采购这些非经营范围内的商品后，既不与经营该商品的公司联系，又不积极设法把它卖出，两年来一直堆放在仓库里无人过问。
    一九五二年，该公司经原东北贸易部批准，采购火硷二、六五○吨，每吨进货价为一千二百万元，然而东北市场出售牌价却为一千零二十六万元，加上运输、保管费等费用，以致赔损了五十三亿余元。类似这种进货价高而出售价低的事，据统计仅硬化油、甘油、硬脂酸、电石、火硷等五种商品，在一九五二年就亏损了四百六十亿元。
    该公司盲目调拨的情况也是惊人的。他们曾将海上用的望远镜、染料和电车线，拨给离海数千里、既无染厂、又无电车的黑龙江省。该公司在保管工作上也很混乱，釸钢片都生了锈，电瓷瓶损坏了百分之三十，好钢与废铁混堆，这样的事简直说不完。在销售中，把无缝钢管作一般钢管出售，把锋钢作水钢卖，把电线“盘”以“公斤”价或“卷”以“磅”价出售的例子也是不少的。
    工业器材类商品的品种、规格、质量，确比一般商品复杂些，但该公司有些同志对此认识不足，采取满不在乎的态度；另一些同志则特别强调工作的复杂性，不是以积极的态度去克服困难，发生了问题总是以“我是外行，不懂业务”来搪塞。大家都缺乏钻研业务的精神，因而该公司经营管理长期混乱。
    财务管理异常混乱
    该公司在财务管理上是异常混乱的。他们常常买东西先付款或多付款。从一九五一年四月一日到一九五二年八月三十一日，该公司由于先付款（不包括加工订货支付合理的订金部分）后提货、不及时提货与不提货所搁置的流动资金，仅鞍山钢铁公司一个单位每日平均即达四十亿元，最高额曾达到三百九十九亿余元，鞍山钢铁公司有一次就退给该公司三百二十亿元。该公司要买什么商品，不管工厂有货无货，也不签订购销合同，就先支付预购金。如同一时期内，鞍山钢铁公司这种性质的退款就有一百亿元。一九五一年本溪煤铁公司的枪用钢每公斤卖价为二○、五二六元，而该公司每公斤却支付四一、五七六元，一直到一九五二年“三反”后才要回了多付出的部分。
    该公司在推销工作中浪费流动资金的情况也是很严重的：该公司商品卖出后，由于财务账簿混乱，经常不知道卖了什么或卖了多少；卖出商品时，由于货票不同行，很久要不回钱来，而要回的钱往往也不能立即入账，因而产生了大量“假预收金额”。这种“假预收金额”在一九五二年第三季度累计竟达到一万二千五百亿元。一九五一年三月，该公司卖给中国医药公司东北区公司价值二百二十亿元的四百八十一箱药品，一年多的时间既不转账也不要钱，简直忘了有这回事。去年“三反”运动时，东北医药公司多出商品去该公司查账才发现这件事，但该公司此时还不积极设法处理，拖到去年第三季度才转了账。该公司一九五二年末应该结算而未结算的流动资金占全部资金的百分之二十九点九四，占整个商品库存总值的百分之四十以上。
    账面上商品名称不统一，规格不一样，单位不一致，造成的损失也是严重而普遍的。同一商品的计算单位有记吨、公斤、磅的，有记个、组、套、打、罗、捆、扎、根、张、块、箱的。严重的是买时用此，卖时用彼，每个人可以随便给商品起名称、叫规格、定单位，造成严重的货账不符、账账不符、买卖的商品不能入账等各种形式的浪费资金和积压商品的现象。因此，该公司从去年第二、三季度就开始清理库存，去年第四季度又列为中心任务，但直到今天还是心中无数、没有清好，不得不把东北商业管理局今年第一季度必须核定资金的规定，推迟到第二季度进行。
    上级领导也有责任
    东北工业器材公司造成上述严重问题，除本身应负主要责任外，原东北贸易部一九五一年盲目指示该公司收购原东北工业部所属一百七十余个厂矿价值数千亿元的呆滞材料，原中国工业器材公司一九五一年盲目拨给该公司九百余亿元全国都在积压的正丁醇、氯酸钠、防寒剂等八种商品，一九五二年六月拨给东北早已积压的一百三十亿元的锌锭，特别是原东北贸易部和原中国工业器材公司对该公司经营管理的混乱状态，既缺乏认真的督促检查，又没有很好帮助其改进，也应该负重要的责任。
    这种盲目经营和财务管理中的混乱状态是不应该继续存在了。现在，东北工业器材公司已改组为机器五金、化工原料、交通电工器材等三个公司了。这些公司必须把严重不负责任、盲目经营的供给制思想当作工作中的最大敌人，在清产、赶账、对账、消灭商业信用、处理损益和搞好一九五二年决算的基础上，迅速认真地核定资金，通过国家银行划拨清算的监督，来彻底的克服供给制经营思想，实行经济核算制，以便从改进经营中抽出资金投入国家经济建设。
