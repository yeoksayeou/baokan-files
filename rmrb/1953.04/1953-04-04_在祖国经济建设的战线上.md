On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland

    New Contributions of the Working Class in Anshan to the Motherland
    The entire staff of the Iron Smelting Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled the state's first-quarter production plan nine days and seventeen hours ahead of schedule. As of March 27, the quality plan was completed by 89.3 percent, and the scrap rate was reduced by 3.5 percent according to state regulations.
    The entire staff of the Medium-Sized Plant victoriously completed the state's first-quarter production plan at 4:00 PM on March 22, nine days and eight hours ahead of schedule. The qualification rate was 96.62 percent, and the recovery rate was 94.07 percent, both exceeding the national standards.

    The 53 Factory Completes the First Quarter Plan Ahead of Schedule
    The National Model Factory – the 53 Factory – comprehensively completed the state's first-quarter production plan thirteen days ahead of schedule, with output reaching 116.4 percent, quality exceeding the original plan by 1.2 percent, and costs reduced by 1.6 percent. During the first quarter, the factory accepted an urgent task from superiors to trial-produce a large number of new products. Through the efforts of all employees, they overcame various difficulties and finally completed the task on time.
    In completing the state's first-quarter production plan, they conscientiously studied and promoted the Soviet advanced experience of "rapid operation," which is of decisive significance to the factory's overall production. To promote this advanced experience, the leadership specially organized technicians and skilled workers from departments and workshops to form specialized groups, responsible for helping workshops solve problems related to machinery and equipment and helping workers improve their skills. After this advanced experience was promoted in the second, third, and fifth workshops, the efficiency of machinery and equipment was greatly improved. In addition, they also promoted advanced experiences such as product standardization.
    In order to ensure the smooth completion of the plan, each group checked individual action plans daily, and each week, the group checked the patriotic pledge. Workshops checked the implementation of guarantee contracts every half month, and factory leaders checked the implementation of collective contracts every month. Problems were discovered and resolved promptly through these levels of inspection.
    Currently, the factory's employees have launched a competition to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day and the Seventh National Labor Congress.

    Achievements of the New Shanghai Steel Plant in Implementing Planned Management
    After implementing planned management, the Shanghai State-Owned New Shanghai Steel Plant changed the past situation where it frequently failed to complete state plans. The factory's main products, steel, cold-cast train wheels, and rolling mill rolls, all completed this year's first-quarter production plan ahead of schedule, and the quality also exceeded the standards set by superiors.
    Starting in January of this year, they implemented planned production. Each month's work plan was distributed to groups for discussion, and specific daily production figures were set for each group, individual, and machine tool. Workshops also launched a red flag competition. To mourn the death of Comrade Stalin, three shifts in the rolling mill workshop launched a competition, creating six new records in eight days and completing 52.7 percent of the monthly plan. The entire factory also established a daily inspection system, with production progress officers from each workshop reporting to the production section chief and the factory director on the completion of work plans, existing problems, etc., so that the leadership could quickly identify and grasp weak links in production and improve them in a timely manner. The technical research groups organized administratively in the cold-casting and rolling workshops played a significant role in solving technical problems in production, making a great contribution to the completion of the plan.

    Temporary Construction Projects in Shenyang City Universally Commence
    The construction preparation work in Shenyang City has entered the most intense stage. For the various projects scheduled for the first phase of construction, workers have already begun to enter the construction sites. The vast majority of the temporary construction projects, such as worker dormitories, canteens, construction site offices, as well as wood processing plants and concrete mixing plants, have begun to be built. Various building materials and construction equipment are being transported to the construction sites.
    Shenyang City has a heavy basic construction task this year, and ensuring the timely commencement of the first phase of projects is the key to completing the annual basic construction task. The construction workers of Shenyang City have significantly improved their political awareness and technical level after winter training and learning. In order to ensure the completion of the national construction plan, they not only conscientiously learned advanced experience but also further enriched advanced experience and created many new experiences. For example, Cui Jingbo, an old bricklayer from the First Engineering Company of the Electrical Engineering Bureau, created three tools for bricklaying: a "vertical corner bricklayer," a "level line ruler," and a "mortar receiving hopper," enriching the Su Changyou bricklaying method, enabling apprentices and fifth- and sixth-grade workers to do the work of senior technicians, and improving bricklaying efficiency. Zhou Shangchang, Wang Fushan, Shi Anchang, Deng Wanfu, and Shi Wenbo, five carpenters from the Second Engineering Company, are researching nine types of woodworking machinery for making doors and windows, such as the "flat wheel electric planer," to improve the degree of mechanization in carpentry work. Li Shenghua, a plasterer from the First Engineering Company, created tools such as inside corner and outside corner plastering tools and a mortar holder for plastering ceilings, reducing labor and enabling apprentices to replace technicians in operation. Many construction workers have expressed that they will continue to improve their skills and improve labor efficiency, striving to complete the national plan ahead of schedule after construction begins.
    In order to ensure the supply of living materials for basic construction workers after construction begins, municipal state-owned commercial organs, municipal cooperative societies, and other units are also stepping up preparations.

    Anshan Iron and Steel Launches a Mechanical Automation Movement
    Since the promotion of the mechanical automation movement experience from small rolling mills, a mass mechanical automation movement has been widely launched in various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and many inventions and creations have emerged. Wang Zhiyuan, a worker at the Steel Pipe Plant, saw that the workers in the second cooling table pipe discharge trough were very tired and exposed to heat, so he began to study the automation of the pipe discharge trough. The result was a complete success, greatly reducing physical labor and avoiding heat exposure. Li Changfu researched an automatically rising and falling "ram," reducing the physical labor of the ironworkers when making certain plier heads, saving one worker, reducing accidents, and increasing output by 30 percent, with completely qualified quality. Sun Jingcheng, a worker at the coking workshop of the Chemical Plant, created an automatic exchange, ensuring the quality of coke and greatly benefiting the protection of the furnace body. In addition, workers and technicians from units such as the Oxygen Plant, Medium Plate Plant, and Mechanical Division Engineering Team also modified some machines, some of which improved efficiency threefold, and some of which solved key problems in the work.

Xinhua News Agency News: Large-Scale Exploration of Mineral Deposits in the Northwest
    The Northwest Geological Bureau has organized eight geological exploration teams this year (excluding the two teams directly led by the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government) to conduct large-scale key exploration in the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Xinjiang. Among them, two teams will investigate coal mines in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu and the Pingluo area of Ningxia, one team will explore chromite in the Helan Mountains of Ningxia, another team will explore porphyry copper mines in the Qinling Mountains in southern Shaanxi, and the other four teams will explore other important mineral resources in Xinjiang. After last year's investigation, the chromite in Ningxia and the porphyry copper mines in southern Shaanxi have mastered accurate geological data, and large-scale detailed surveys, trenching, and pitting work will be carried out this year. The exploration teams in these two regions are also equipped with physical prospecting teams and chemical prospecting teams by the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government to use new instruments for prospecting.

    Going to New Posts
    Recently, more than 500 disabled revolutionary soldiers have been assigned to do political work in the basic construction departments of East China. This is a new force in the basic construction team.
    They are all warriors who have fought many battles. More than 20 percent of them participated in the revolution during the Anti-Japanese War. They shed blood for the people, and about 30 percent of them have been credited with three or more merits. More than 70 percent of them gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.
    Although their bodies are disabled, they said, "Our revolutionary will will never be disabled." When the superiors decided to transfer them to participate in basic construction work, everyone was extremely excited. Comrade Ma Fuji, who had been injured three times, said, "Great construction is the great happy event we have been waiting for for many years. As soon as I heard that I was participating in great construction, my feet didn't hurt anymore!" Comrade Tang Hua said, "I used to be a farmer. In order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, I became a soldier of the Liberation Army. Now that I am participating in great construction, I am going to become a worker again." Now these more than 500 disabled revolutionary soldiers have been assigned to work in various units under the East China Construction Engineering Bureau.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    鞍山工人阶级对祖国的新贡献
    鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂全体职工提前九天十七小时超额完成了国家第一季度生产计划。到三月二十七日止，质量计划完成百分之八十九点三，废品率按国家规定降低百分之三点五。
    中型厂全体职工于三月二十二日午后四时胜利地完成了第一季度国家生产计划，提前了九天零八小时。合格率完成百分之九十六点六二，收得率完成了百分之九十四点零七，均超过国定标准。
    五三工厂提前完成第一季度计划
    全国模范工厂——五三工厂，提前十三天全面地完成了第一季度的国家生产计划，产量完成了百分之一百一十六点四，质量超过原订计划的百分之一点二，成本降低了百分之一点六。该厂在第一季度中接受了上级临时增加的试制大批新产品的紧急任务，经全体职工努力，克服了各种困难，终于按时胜利完成。
    他们在完成第一季度国家生产计划中，认真学习和推广了对全厂生产有决定意义的苏联先进经验——快速作业。为了推广这一先进经验，领导上特地组织了科室和车间的技术员和技术工人组成专业小组，负责帮助车间解决机器设备方面的问题，并帮助工人提高技术。这一先进经验在该厂二、三、五等三个车间推广后，机器设备效能大为提高。另外，他们还推广了产品规格标准化等先进经验。
    为了保证顺利完成计划，各个小组每天都检查一次个人的行动计划，每个星期一检查一次小组爱国公约；车间半个月检查一次执行保证合同的情况；工厂领导同志每个月检查一次集体合同执行的情况。通过层层检查，及时发现和解决问题。
    目前该厂职工已展开了迎接“五一”国际劳动节和第七次全国劳动大会的竞赛。
    新沪钢铁厂实行计划管理的成就
    上海国营新沪钢铁厂实行计划管理后，改变了过去经常不能完成国家计划的局面。厂里的主要产品钢材、冷铸车轮和轧辊，都提前完成了今年第一季度生产计划，质量也超过了上级规定的标准。
    从今年一月份起，他们实行了计划生产，每个月的作业计划，都发到小组里讨论，并具体订出了各组、个人、每一机床设备的每天生产数字。各车间还展开了红旗竞赛。为了悼念斯大林同志的逝世，轧钢车间三个班展开竞赛，八天里创造六个新纪录，完成了全月计划的百分之五十二点七。全厂并建立了每天检查制度，由各车间生产进度员每天向生产科长及厂长汇报完成作业计划情况、存在的问题等，使领导上能很快地发现和抓住生产中的薄弱环节，及时改进。行政上在冷铸和轧钢车间组织的技术研究组，在解决生产中的技术问题上，起了不少作用，对完成计划有很大贡献。
    沈阳市的暂设工程普遍开工
    沈阳市的施工准备工作进入了最紧张的阶段。已排定第一期施工的各项工程，工人已开始进入工地，绝大部分工地的暂设工程，如工人宿舍、食堂、工地办公室以及木材加工厂、混凝土搅拌厂等，都已开始修建。各种建筑材料及施工设备正在运入工地。
    沈阳市今年的基本建设任务很繁重，保证第一期工程按时开工，是完成全年基本建设任务的关键问题。沈阳市的建筑工人经过冬训学习，政治觉悟与技术水平显著提高。他们为了保证完成国家建设计划，不但认真学习了先进经验，同时进一步丰富了先进经验和创造了许多新的经验。如电工局第一工程公司老瓦工崔静波创造了砌砖用的“垂直砌角器”“平线尺”“接灰斗”等三种工具，丰富了苏长有砌砖法，使徒工和五、六级工可以干高级技工的活，并提高了砌砖效率。第二工程公司周尚昌、王富山、师长安、邓万富、施文博五名木工正在研究“平轮电刨子”等九种做门窗的木工机械，以便提高木工工作中的机械化程度。第一工程公司抹灰工人李升华创造了里角、外角抹灰器和抹天棚的托灰器等工具，减轻了劳动，并使徒工可以代替技工操作。很多建筑工人表示，要不断地提高技术，提高劳动效率，争取在施工开始后提前完成国家计划。
    为了保证开工后基本建设职工的生活资料供应，市国营商业机关、市合作总社等单位也正在加紧准备。
    鞍钢展开机械自动化运动
    鞍山钢铁公司从推广小型轧钢厂机械自动化运动经验后，各厂矿普遍开展了群众性的机械自动化运动，出现了很多发明创造。钢管厂工人王志远看到第二冷却台放管槽工人操作很累，还受火烤，就开始研究放管槽自动化，结果完全成功，大大减轻了体力劳动，并避免了火烤。李长富研究出一个自动起落的“摔子”，减轻了铁工班做某种钳子头时的体力劳动，节省了一个人工，减少事故，提高产量百分之三十，质量完全合格。化工总厂炼焦车间工人孙景成创造出自动交换机，保证了焦炭质量，对保护炉体也有很大好处。此外，氧气厂、中板厂、机械处工程队等单位的工人和技术员也改造了一些机器，有的提高了效率三倍，有的解决了工作中的关键问题。
    大规模地勘探西北矿藏
    西北地质局今年组织了八个地质勘探队（不包括中央人民政府地质部直接领导的两个队），到陕西、甘肃、宁夏、新疆四省进行大规模的重点勘探。其中有两个队到甘肃河西走廊和宁夏平罗一带调查煤矿，一个队到宁夏贺兰山中勘探铬矿，另一个队到陕西南部秦岭山脉中勘探斑状铜矿，另外还有四个队到新疆勘探其他重要矿产资源。宁夏的铬矿和陕西南部的斑状铜矿经过去年的调查，已掌握了确实的地质资料，今年要进行大规模的详查、槽探和坑探工作。这两个地区的勘探队，并由中央人民政府地质部配有物理探矿队和化学探矿队，运用新式仪器进行探矿。（据新华社讯）
    到新岗位上去
    最近有五百多位革命残废军人被分配到华东基本建设部门做政治工作，这是基本建设队伍中的一支生力军。
    他们都是经过很多次战斗的勇士，有百分之二十以上是抗日战争时期就参加革命的。他们为人民流过鲜血，其中立过三次功以上的就有百分之三十左右；百分之七十以上都光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    他们的身体虽然残废了，但他们说：“我们的革命意志是永远也不会残废的。”当上级决定调他们参加基本建设工作时，大家都兴奋得不得了。负过三次伤的马富记同志说：“大建设是我们盼了多少年的大喜事，一听说参加大建设，我的脚也不痛啦！”唐华同志说：“我过去原是个农民，为了打垮蒋介石，我当了解放军；现在参加大建设，我又要变成一个工人了。”现在这五百多位革命残废军人同志，已经被分派到华东建筑工程局所属各单位去工作了。
