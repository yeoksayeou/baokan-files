Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: Pravda published an editorial entitled "Soviet Socialist Law is Inviolable," commenting on the announcement published in the Soviet newspapers by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs after a careful examination of the preliminary investigation materials and other materials of the case of the group of doctors accused of sabotage, espionage and terrorist acts against activists of the Soviet state.

As everyone knows, according to the conclusion of the investigation committee specially set up by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs to investigate this case, the accused and arrested professors and doctors have been completely rehabilitated. Those who committed crimes due to incorrect interrogation have been arrested and held criminally liable.

Pravda wrote: The duty of the Soviet state security organs is to protect the interests of the Soviet state, but how could it happen that honest Soviet people and outstanding scientists were framed in this department?

This happened mainly because the leaders of the former Soviet state security organs were not up to standard. They had lost contact with the people and the Party, and had forgotten that they were servants of the people and that they had a responsibility to protect Soviet law. S. Ignatiev, the former Minister of State Security, showed political blindness and gullibility, and he followed the lead of criminal adventurers like Ryumin, the former Deputy Minister and Director of the Investigation Department, who was in charge of the interrogation at the time and has now been arrested. Ryumin acted as if he were a hidden enemy of our country and our people. Instead of working hard to uncover the real enemies of the Soviet state, the real spies and saboteurs, Ryumin took the road of a criminal adventurer who deceived the government. In order to achieve their criminal aims, Ryumin and some other personnel of the State Security organs tarnished the lofty mission of the state organs and their responsibility to the Party and the people; they flagrantly violated Soviet law, fabricated accusations, and dared to despise the sacred and inviolable rights guaranteed by our Constitution.

The committee of medical experts formed to study the accusations against this group of doctors also failed to fulfill its duties and made incorrect conclusions about the methods of treating A.S. Shcherbakov and A.A. Zhdanov. Instead of analyzing the medical records and other materials in the spirit of scientific objectivity and conscience, this committee was influenced by the fabricated materials in the interrogation and used its authority to support the framing of some outstanding doctors. It should also be pointed out that the interrogation concealed certain important aspects from the experts that could prove the correctness of the medical measures.

The Soviet people are satisfied to learn that the accusations against the outstanding Soviet doctors have been proven to be completely untrue, which is a malicious slander against honest and reputable Soviet citizens. Only those who have lost the characteristics of Soviet people and human dignity would dare to carry out such illegal arrests of Soviet citizens and famous Soviet doctors, would dare to directly fabricate interrogations, and would dare to criminally violate their civic duties.

Ryumin and other despicable adventurers attempted to use the cases they fabricated to incite national hatred in Soviet society, which has been forged into a moral and political unity by the ideas of proletarian internationalism, and which runs counter to socialist ideology. In order to achieve their provocative aims, they unscrupulously framed the Soviet people. For example, a careful examination determined that Mikhoels, an honest public figure and People's Artist of the Soviet Union, was framed in this way.

It can be seen from the announcement of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs that the organs of the former State Security Department flagrantly violated Soviet law, acted arbitrarily, and abused their powers. Such criminal behavior will not go undetected for long, because the Soviet government protects the rights of our citizens, carefully protects these rights, and severely punishes anyone who dares to take arbitrary measures, no matter who he is or what position he holds.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government have always demanded that the leading organs of Soviet society and the entire Soviet society vigilantly supervise the work of all organizations and the entire state apparatus. Now that the Soviet people deeply realize the significance of the victory of socialism in our country, we must be especially vigilant and especially strictly demand compliance with Soviet socialist law.

The Soviet government boldly exposes the shortcomings of state organs, including the arbitrary and lawless acts of individual state organ officials, resolutely and uncompromisingly eradicates them, and openly and directly informs the people of these shortcomings. This proves the great strength of the Soviet state and the socialist system. The source of this strength is that our government maintains close and unbreakable ties with the people, it receives the support of the people in all its activities, and it resolutely and consistently pursues policies that are in line with the vital interests of the people.

The creative, powerful, and invincible socialist country is confidently advancing towards communism. The exploiting classes have long been eliminated in the Soviet Union. Therefore, foreign reactionary forces cannot have any significant social basis in the Soviet Union for carrying out subversive activities. However, the Soviet people know that as long as capitalist encirclement exists, attempts to send spies and saboteurs to our country, and attempts to hire individual traitors, representatives of bourgeois ideology, and defectors to achieve anti-Soviet goals, will inevitably occur today and in the future. We must always be vigilant and prepared to deal with these open and hidden real enemies of the people and the Soviet state. The Party educates the Soviet people to always be vigilant.

Pravda concluded by writing: Socialist law, which protects the rights of Soviet citizens guaranteed by the Soviet Constitution, is the supreme principle for the further development and consolidation of the Soviet state.

No one shall be allowed to violate Soviet law. Every worker, every collective farmer, and every Soviet intellectual can work with peace of mind and confidence, because he knows that his civil rights are reliably protected by Soviet socialist law.

Every citizen of the great Soviet country can be confident that the Soviet government will carefully respect and protect the rights guaranteed to him by the Soviet Constitution.

This is one of the important conditions for the closer unity between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, the further strengthening of our motherland, and the continuous enhancement of the Soviet Union's international prestige.

    苏维埃社会主义法律是不可侵犯的
    ——苏联“真理报”社论摘要
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科六日电：真理报以“苏维埃社会主义法律是不可侵犯的”为题发表社论，评论苏联报纸刊载的苏联内务部就被控进行破坏、间谍活动和对苏维埃国家的积极活动家施行恐怖手段的医生集团一案的预审材料和其他材料予以精密检查后所发表的通告。
    大家知道，根据苏联内务部为检查这一案件而特设的侦讯委员会的结论，被控有罪并被逮捕的教授和医生们已完全恢复名誉。因进行了不正确的侦讯而犯罪的人已予以逮捕并使其负刑事责任。
    真理报写道：苏联国家保安部的职责是保卫苏维埃国家的利益，而诚实的苏维埃人民、杰出的科学家却居然在这个部里遭到诬陷，这是怎么能够发生的呢？
    这件事的发生，主要是因为前苏联国家保安部的领导者们是不合标准的。他们已失去与人民、与党的联系，已忘记他们是人民的勤务员，忘记他们有责任保卫苏维埃法律。前国家保安部部长斯·伊格纳捷夫表现了政治盲目性和易受欺骗，他做了像当时负责侦讯、现在已被逮捕的前副部长、侦讯司司长柳明之类罪恶的冒险家的尾巴。柳明的行动就好像是我们国家和我们人民的暗藏的敌人一样。柳明不但不为破获苏维埃国家真正的敌人、真正的间谍和破坏分子而努力，反而走了欺骗政府的罪恶的冒险家所走的道路。为了遂行他们罪恶的目的，柳明和国家保安部的若干其他工作人员玷污了国家机关工作人员的崇高使命和对党、对人民的责任；他们穷凶极恶地违犯了苏维埃法律，捏造了起诉材料，竟敢蔑视我们宪法所保证的神圣不可侵犯的权利。
    为研究对这一批医生的控告而组成的医学专家委员会也没有尽到它的职责，对治疗亚·塞·谢尔巴科夫和安·亚·日丹诺夫的方法作了不正确的结论。这个委员会没有本着科学的客观性和良心来分析病历和其他材料，却受了侦讯中捏造的材料的影响，把它的权威用来支持了对一些杰出的医生的诬陷。还应该指出的是：侦讯向专家们掩盖了可以证明医疗措施正确性的某些重要方面。
    苏联人民满意地获悉：对杰出的苏联医生的控告被证明完全是不真实的，这是对诚实的、负有名望的苏联诚实公民的恶毒的诬陷。只有丧失了苏维埃人的特性的人，丧失了人类尊严的人才会干出这种非法逮捕苏联公民、著名的苏联医生的勾当，才会干出这种直接捏造侦讯的勾当，才会干出这种罪恶地违背他们的公民职责的勾当。
    柳明之流的卑鄙的冒险家企图假手于他们所捏造的案情，在已被无产阶级的国际主义思想熔炼成为一个道德和政治上的统一整体的苏维埃社会煽起和社会主义思想背道而驰的民族仇恨。为了遂行他们的挑拨的目的，他们不惜无耻地诬陷苏联人民。例如，精密的检查确定：诚实的公众领袖、苏联人民艺术家米霍耶尔斯就是这么被诬陷的。
    从苏联内务部的通告中可以看出：前国家保安部的机关穷凶极恶地违犯苏维埃法律，专横武断，滥用职权。这种犯罪行为是不会长期不被揭发而逍遥法外的，因为苏联政府保护我国公民的权利，谨慎地保护这些权利，并严惩一切敢于采取专横手段的人，不管他是什么人，是什么职位。
    共产党和苏联政府过去和现在始终要求苏维埃社会的各个领导机关和全苏维埃社会警惕地监督着一切组织和整个国家机关的工作。现在，当苏联人民都十分深刻地认识到社会主义在我国胜利的意义时，我们就必须特别警惕，特别严格地要求遵守苏维埃社会主义法律。
    苏联政府大胆揭露国家机关的缺点，包括国家机关个别职员的专横武断和目无法纪的行为在内，断然地、毫不妥协地加以根除，并把这些缺点公开地、直接地告诉人民。这证明了苏维埃国家和社会主义制度的伟大力量。这种力量的源泉就是：我们政府和人民保持着紧密的、牢不可破的联系，它在一切活动中都得到人民的支持，它坚决地、一贯地奉行着符合人民切身利益的政策。
    充满创造力的、强大的、不可战胜的社会主义国家，正满怀信心地向共产主义前进。剥削阶级在苏联早已被消灭了。因此，外国反动势力在苏联国内不可能有任何值得一提的社会基础来进行颠覆活动。不过，苏联人民知道，只要资本主义包围存在一天，那么今天和将来就不可避免地会有人企图把间谍和破坏分子派到我国，同时还企图雇用个别的叛徒，资产阶级思想的代表和变节分子来达到反苏的目的。我们必须时刻警惕，准备对付人民的和苏维埃国家的这些公开的和隐蔽的真正敌人。党教育苏联人民要经常保持警惕。
    真理报最后写道：保卫着苏联宪法所保证的苏联公民权利的社会主义法律，是苏维埃国家进一步发展和巩固的最高原则。
    任何人都不得破坏苏维埃法律。每一个工人，每一个集体农民，每一个苏维埃知识分子都可以安定地和满怀信心地工作，因为他知道，他的公民权利有苏维埃社会主义法律可靠地保卫着。
    伟大的苏维埃国家的每一个公民都可以确信：苏联政府将谨慎地尊重并保护着苏联宪法向他保证的权利。
    这是苏联各族人民和苏联政府的更加紧密的团结、我们祖国的进一步加强和苏联国际威信不断提高的重要条件之一。
