    The vast people of rural North China have achieved unprecedentedly heightened democratic awareness in the democratic governance work of the past three years, creating favorable conditions for the implementation of universal suffrage. The facts of Baodi County, Hebei Province, an ordinary county, fully demonstrate this point.

    Baodi County has been holding county-level people's representative conferences regularly since 1949, and has held ten sessions by February of this year. All 728 villages in the county have held people's representative conferences. The number of representatives to the county-level people's representative conferences elected by the people has gradually increased. When the first county-level people's representative conference was convened in 1949, representatives elected by the people accounted for 70 percent; now they account for more than 95 percent.

    When electing representatives to people's representative conferences at all levels, the people of the county are very active and cautious. For example, when Jiangshiwo Village elected representatives, it deliberated continuously for five days, and more than 80 percent of the voters in the village participated in the election. Yu Yongchun's mother, who is over sixty years old, also actively participated in the election. She recommended a representative to everyone, saying, "Guo Hechang has been a cadre in our village since 1946. He has never lost his temper and always answers questions. I think he can do things for everyone, and everyone should elect him." Representatives to the county-level people's representative conference have been re-elected twice, and good representatives have been re-elected in the re-elections. For example, Bai Tingyu, a representative from Hujiayuanzi Village, has been re-elected every time because he works actively, earnestly reflects the opinions of the masses, and has been a representative for three years. Representatives who cannot represent the interests of the masses are not supported by the people and are defeated in the re-elections. Li Shan, a representative from Xitai Village, did not convey the spirit of the meetings to the masses after the meetings, nor did he solicit proposals from the masses before the meetings, and only cared about his own life. The masses in the village said, "What kind of representative is it to be a representative who doesn't care about everyone!" Later, they elected Chen Shiheng, who was loved by everyone, to replace him. The people supervise the representatives at any time. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, Jiao Jingbo, a representative from the industrial and commercial circles, did not convey the spirit of the county-level people's representative conference to the industrial and commercial circles after attending it. Everyone criticized him. Under the supervision of everyone, Jiao Jingbo not only conscientiously conveyed the spirit after returning from the meeting, but also organized industrialists and businessmen to study the Common Program.

    The people of the county manage the affairs of the county through the county-level people's representative conferences, improving and promoting various tasks. The number of proposals received by the county-level people's representative conferences has increased year by year. When the county-level people's representative conference was held in February this year, a total of 280 proposals were received, an increase of more than three times compared with 1952. Since October of last year, the Standing Committee of the County People's Representative Conference has received an average of more than 200 letters from representatives and the masses every month, excluding oral conversations. The representatives are very concerned about the county's policies and measures, and often supervise the work of the county people's government and put forward opinions. At the county-level people's representative conference held in February this year, the representative of Xizhai Village criticized the county people's government's work plan for this year, saying that the item "developing and consolidating mutual aid teams" was not specific enough. He suggested that the county people's government find ways to transfer farmers for agricultural technology training, and take improving the agricultural technology of mutual aid teams as one of the contents of developing and consolidating mutual aid teams. Representatives also raised criticisms at the meeting regarding transactions between cooperatives and non-members, unplanned flooding of land when opening canals, and the poor work of individual cadres. Because the people are the masters of the country, they have increased infinite power to implement the resolutions of the people's representative conferences at all levels. For example, after the farmers' representatives from Yuejiayuanzi and other ten villages put forward a proposal to open canals for irrigation, the county-level people's representative conference immediately made a resolution, and the people of the county actively participated in this canal-opening project, promoting the county's agricultural production work.

### 河北宝坻县广大人民民主觉悟空前提高  三年来的民主建政工作给实行普选创造了良好条件

    河北宝坻县广大人民民主觉悟空前提高
    三年来的民主建政工作给实行普选创造了良好条件
    华北农村的广大人民，在三年多来的民主建政工作中民主觉悟空前提高，给实行普选创造了良好的条件，河北省宝坻县这一普通县份的事实充分证明了这一点。
    宝坻县从一九四九年起即定期举行县各界人民代表会议，到今年二月已开过十次。全县七百二十八个村都举行过人民代表会议。县各界人民代表会议的代表，由人民选举的逐渐增多。一九四九年召开第一次县各界人民代表会议时，由人民选举的代表占百分之七十；现在已占百分之九十五以上。
    选举各级人民代表会议的代表时，全县人民都很积极和慎重。如江石窝村有次选举代表时，连续进行了五天酝酿，全村选民有百分之八十以上参加了选举。于永春的母亲已六十多岁，也积极参加了选举。她向大家推荐代表说：“郭贺昌一九四六年就在咱村当干部，从没发过脾气，问他事就给答复。我看他能给大家办事，大家应该选举他。”县各界人民代表会议的代表已改选两次，好的代表在改选中都连选连任。如胡家园子村代表白廷玉，因平时工作积极，认真反映群众意见，每次改选都连选连任，现已当了三年代表。不能代表群众利益的代表，在改选中由于人民不拥护便落选了。西台村代表李山开会后不向群众传达，开会前也不向群众征求提案，只顾过自己的日子。该村群众说：“当代表不管大家算什么代表！”后来便选举大家所爱戴的陈士衡代替了他。人民群众对代表随时进行督促。“三反”、“五反”运动后，工商界代表焦竞波有次开完县各界人民代表会议回去未向工商界作传达，大家就对他提出了批评。焦竞波在大家的督促下，以后不但开会回去后认真作传达，还组织工商业者学习共同纲领。
    全县人民通过县各界人民代表会议管理全县事务，改进并推动了各项工作。县各界人民代表会议收到的提案逐年增多。今年二月举行县各界人民代表会议时，共收到提案二百八十件，较一九五二年增加了三倍多。县各界人民代表会议常务委员会自去年十月份以来，除口头交谈不算外，平均每月收到代表和群众的信件二百多封。代表们非常关心县政措施，对县人民政府的工作经常进行监督并提出意见。在今年二月举行的县各界人民代表会议上，西寨村代表批评县人民政府今年工作计划中“发展巩固互助组”一项不够具体，他建议县人民政府设法抽调农民进行农业技术训练，把提高互助组的农业技术作为发展巩固互助组的内容之一。对合作社和非社员交易、开渠无计划淹了地、个别干部工作不好等，代表们也在会上提出了批评。人民由于当了国家主人，对执行各界人民代表会议的决议就增加了无限力量。如岳家园子等十个村的农民代表提出开渠浇地的建议后，县各界人民代表会议即作成决议，全县人民积极参加了这一开渠工程，推动了全县的农业生产工作。（新华社）
