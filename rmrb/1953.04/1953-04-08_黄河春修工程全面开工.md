The Yellow River spring repair project fully commenced at the end of March. In Henan Province, ten counties including Zhongmu, Wuzhi, and Qinyang have started work on their sections of the dyke, with 8,360 laborers working on the dykes. In Shandong Province, twelve counties including Licheng, Qidong, and Lijin have also started work on their sections of the dyke, with 58,263 laborers working on the dykes.

This year, the laborers from various counties participating in the Yellow River spring repair project have received patriotic education, implemented the piecework system of contracting work and receiving more pay for more work, and promoted advanced work methods, resulting in improved engineering quality and work efficiency compared to previous years. During the spring repair of the dyke section from Jiu Guangwu to Zhengzhou in Henan Province, a soil team of over seventy people led by Cao Hongxiu, a model worker in harnessing the Huai River, achieved an average of 6.5 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day from the start, earning each worker a wage of 13,600 yuan per work day. The efficiency of stonework in the Guang-Zheng section increased from 1.77 cubic meters per work day to 2.5 cubic meters after implementing the assembly line operation method, while also ensuring quality standards. The Jinan Engineering Team conserved 10 million yuan for the state by sourcing stone materials locally for the rubble pitching project. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 黄河春修工程全面开工

    黄河春修工程全面开工
    黄河春修工程已经在三月底全面开工。河南省有中牟、武陟、沁阳等十个县的堤段开工，上堤民工达八千三百六十人。山东省也有历城、齐东、利津等十二个县的堤段开工，上堤民工达五万八千二百六十三人。
    今年参加黄河春修工程的各县民工，由于受到了爱国主义的教育，贯彻了包工包做、多做多得的工资政策，推广了先进工作法，因而使工程质量和工作效率比往年都有提高。河南省境内从旧广武到郑州一段堤段的春修中，在治淮劳动模范曹洪修率领下的一支七十多人的土工队，一开始每人每天所做的土方，就平均达到六·五公方，每工可得工资一万三千六百元。广郑段砌石工作的效率，在推行流水作业法后，每工由一·七七公方，提高到二·五公方，并保证了质量标准。济南工程队在抛乱石工程中，向外检料石，给国家节省了一千万元。                                               （新华社）
