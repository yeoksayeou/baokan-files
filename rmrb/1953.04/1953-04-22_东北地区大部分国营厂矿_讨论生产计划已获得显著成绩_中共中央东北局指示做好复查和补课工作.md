    [Reported by this newspaper] Most state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China have discussed the 1953 national plan and achieved significant results. According to incomplete statistics for March, out of 219 factories and mines, 111 had completed the plan discussion, 69 were in the process of discussion, and 39 had not yet started.

    Judging from the actual results, state-owned factories and mines that have completed the national plan discussion can be roughly divided into three types. The first type of factory and mine comprehensively and concretely opposed conservative thinking, conducted thorough and meticulous ideological education for employees, and fully mobilized the masses to carefully discuss the national plan. As a result, they broke through the state-stipulated targets and formulated advanced plans including output, quality, cost, and safety. For example, the plan formulated by Factory 53, compared with the national plan, increased output by 15%, improved quality by 0.241%, and reduced costs by 4%. The plan for manufacturing water pumps by Machinery Factory 6, the national plan already increased output by 68.22% compared to last year, and the total output value increased by 101.45% compared to last year. After mass discussion, the output increased by another 28.52% compared to the national plan, and the total output value increased by another 15.93% compared to the national plan. In these factories and mines, leading cadres conducted prior investigation and research, and then, with leadership and planning, mobilized the employees, targeted key issues in production, and looked for shortcuts and tapped potential. Employees in Shenyang factories found 23,187 shortcuts. According to statistics from 18 factories, 3,372 shortcuts have been adopted. In Dalian, 3,907 shortcuts appeared in various factories, and 2,471 shortcuts have been adopted. These shortcuts played an important role in formulating advanced plans. These factories and mines have all established specific group plans and signed collective contracts, especially completing and exceeding the national plan for the first quarter in a balanced manner. Factories and mines like these account for about 20% of the state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China.

    Leading cadres in the second type of factory and mine generally recognized the importance of mobilizing employees to discuss the plan, but there were shortcomings in their methods and they took detours to varying degrees. They used generalized methods to oppose conservative thinking; and they only paid attention to opposing conservative thinking in terms of output, while neglecting to oppose conservative thinking in terms of quality, cost, and safety. Group plans were relatively empty, and measure plans were also relatively general. In this type of factory and mine, cadres were actively working hard, and the masses were putting in effort everywhere; however, many shortcuts were found, but few were realized, and there were many piecemeal solutions, but few that solved key problems. The leading cadres of this type of factory and mine had enthusiasm for work, but because they did not study production enough and were not familiar with the working methods of mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan, the gains from discussing the plan were not as great as those of the first type of factory and mine. This type of factory and mine accounts for about 60% of the state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China.

    Leading cadres in the third type of factory and mine have serious bureaucracy, treating the discussion of the national plan as a "routine" once a year. They did not study the instructions from higher levels, did not study plan quotas, and pushed such an important task as discussing the plan to lower-level cadres, so that the work of discussing the plan became a mere formality. For example, when discussing the plan at Machinery Factory 2, the factory director and the chairman of the trade union were unwilling to lead, pushing it back and forth, and finally pushing it to a deputy engineer. When they asked workers to make personal production plans, they printed a kind of card and asked workers to fill it out. For example, the leading cadres of the Jiaohe Coal Mine rarely went deep into the lower levels to understand the situation. When the work group of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China reflected to him that a working face that had been implementing "mechanized" production for two years had lower production efficiency than manual production, he said "This is an old problem" and ignored it. Almost none of these factories and mines completed the national plan for the first quarter. This situation shows that in these factories and mines, the bureaucratic style of leading cadres who do not pay attention to the plan and do not rely on the working class to complete the plan is very serious.

    In order to consolidate the achievements of the plan discussion and overcome the shortcomings in the plan discussion, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee instructed all factories and mines to earnestly do a good job in reviewing and making up for the missed lessons in the plan discussion, and put forward different requirements for the three different types of factories and mines. Leading cadres of the first type of factory and mine should realize that discussing the national plan well only creates conditions for improving the level of enterprise management and production. If they really want to change the situation where enterprise management lags behind the development of production and the enthusiasm of employees, they need to establish and improve the plan management system. Therefore, it is necessary to review the group plans and main quotas, prepare operation plans, and supervise the implementation of operation plans to ensure balanced production.

    The second type of factory and mine should criticize the generalized leadership style and the shortcomings of lacking comprehensive policy thinking, and learn to master the correct working methods of mobilizing the masses to discuss the national plan. To this end, in the review or make-up lessons, it is necessary to summarize the situation of implementing the production plan in the first quarter, check the deviations such as quality decline, cost overruns, and increased accidents caused by the one-sidedness of the plan discussion, and overcome the shortcomings such as not properly arranging the various tasks for the whole year (especially the new product plan), the disconnection between the formulation and implementation of the plan, not paying attention to the connection between the upper and lower processes and the balance of the factory's production, and the hasty discussion of quality, cost, and safety plans. On the basis of doing a good job in review and remedial work, further establish and improve the quota management system, establish and improve original records, and create conditions for preparing operation plans.

    For the third type of factory and mine, the higher-level leading organs urgently need to strengthen their leadership, conduct in-depth inspections, and provide specific assistance to reverse the situation of these factories and mines failing to complete the plan, and severely criticize the bureaucratic style of the leading cadres of these factories and mines. Only when the leading cadres of the factories and mines recognize the harm of their own bureaucracy can they do a good job in reviewing or making up for the missed lessons. In individual factories and mines where formalism is particularly serious in the plan discussion, the masses should be remobilized to discuss the national plan.

    东北地区大部分国营厂矿
    讨论生产计划已获得显著成绩
    中共中央东北局指示做好复查和补课工作
    【本报讯】东北大部分国营厂矿已经讨论了一九五三年的国家计划，获得了显著成绩。根据三月份不完全的统计，在二百一十九个厂矿中，已讨论完计划的有一百一十一个，正在讨论的有六十九个，尚未讨论的有三十九个。
    从实际的效果来衡量，已经讨论完国家计划的厂矿大致可分为三种类型。第一类型的厂矿，全面地、具体地反对了保守思想，对职工进行了深入细致的思想教育，充分发动群众细致地讨论了国家计划，因而突破了国家规定的指标，制订了包括产量、质量、成本、安全各方面的先进计划。如五三工厂制订出的计划和国家计划比较，产量提高百分之十五，质量提高百分之零点二四一，成本降低百分之四。机械六厂制造水泵的计划，国家计划产量已较去年提高百分之六十八点二二，生产总值已比去年提高百分之一百零一点四五，经过群众讨论，产量比国家计划又提高了百分之二十八点五二，生产总值又比国家计划提高百分之十五点九三。在这些厂矿中，领导干部事先进行了调查研究，然后有领导、有计划地发动职工群众，针对生产中的关键问题，找窍门，挖潜力。沈阳市各工厂职工找到了二万三千一百八十七个窍门。根据十八个工厂的统计，已采用了三千三百七十二个窍门。旅大市各工厂出现了三千九百零七个窍门，有二千四百七十一个窍门已被采用。这些窍门对制订先进的计划起了重要的作用。这些厂矿都订立了具体的小组计划，签订了集体合同，特别是均衡地完成和超过了第一季度国家计划。像这样的厂矿，约占东北地区国营厂矿的百分之二十。
    第二类型厂矿的领导干部，一般都认识到发动职工讨论计划的重要性，但在做法上有缺点，在不同程度上走了弯路。他们用一般化的方法来反对保守思想；而且只注意反对了产量方面的保守思想，忽视反对质量、成本和安全方面的保守思想。小组计划比较空洞，措施计划也比较笼统。在这类厂矿中，干部积极努力，群众到处使劲；但是窍门找得多，兑现的少，零碎的多，解决关键问题的少。这一类型厂矿的领导干部有工作热情，但因对生产钻研得不够，又不熟悉发动群众讨论计划的工作方法，因此讨论计划的收获不如第一类厂矿那样大。这一类型的厂矿，约占全东北国营厂矿百分之六十。
    第三类型厂矿的领导干部存在着严重的官僚主义，把讨论国家计划看成是一年一次的“例行公事”，不学习上级指示，不研究计划定额，把讨论计划这样重要的工作推给下面干部去办，以致讨论计划的工作流于形式。如机械二厂讨论计划时，厂长和工会主席都不愿领导，推来推去，最后推给一个副工程师去领导。他们叫工人订个人生产计划时，竟印了一种卡片，叫工人填写。又如蛟河煤矿的领导干部，很少深入下层了解情况。当中共吉林省委工作组向他反映一个已经实行“机械化”生产两年的掌子面，生产效率比手工生产效率还低时，他竟说“这是老问题了”，置之不理。这类厂矿几乎都没有完成第一季度国家计划。这种情况说明：在这些厂矿里，领导干部不重视计划，不依靠工人阶级去完成计划的官僚主义作风是很严重的。
    为巩固讨论计划的成果，克服讨论计划中的缺点，中共中央东北局指示各厂矿要认真做好讨论计划的复查和补课工作，并对三种不同类型的厂矿提出了不同的要求。第一类型厂矿的领导干部，应该认识讨论好国家计划，仅仅是给提高企业管理水平和生产水平创造了条件，想要真正改变企业管理落后于生产发展和职工积极性的情况，还需要建立和健全计划管理制度。因此，必须复查小组计划和主要定额，编制作业计划，监督作业计划的执行，以保证均衡生产。
    第二类型厂矿，应批判一般化的领导作风和缺乏全面政策思想的缺点，学会掌握正确地发动群众讨论国家计划的工作方法。为此，在复查或补课中，要总结第一季度执行生产计划的情况，检查由于讨论计划的片面性而引起的质量下降、成本超支、事故增多等偏差，克服没有妥善安排全年的各项工作（特别是新产品计划），制订计划和执行计划脱节，不注意上下工序的联系和全厂生产的平衡，以及质量、成本、安全计划讨论得草率等缺点。在做好复查和补课的基础上，进一步建立和健全定额管理制度，建立和健全原始记录，为编制作业计划创造条件。
    第三种类型的厂矿，亟需上级领导机关加强对他们的领导，深入检查，具体帮助，扭转这些厂矿完不成计划的局面，严厉批判这些厂矿的领导干部的官僚主义作风。只有当厂矿的领导干部认识了自己的官僚主义的危害之后，才能做好复查或补课工作。个别厂矿在讨论计划中形式主义特别严重，则应重新发动群众讨论国家计划。
