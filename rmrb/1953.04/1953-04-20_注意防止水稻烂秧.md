    Pay Attention to Preventing Rice Seedling Rot
    Food Production Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Central People's Government
    According to recent reports, seedling rot has begun to occur in some areas of the Jiangnan region. Agricultural departments in all regions should pay serious attention to this issue and actively take effective measures to prevent or reduce losses of seedlings, ensuring that there are enough healthy seedlings at the time of transplanting.
    In areas where seed rot or seedling rot has already occurred, the masses should be mobilized to help each other, through borrowing, buying, protecting, and conserving seedlings, and by promptly finding ways to replant, to solve the difficulty of seedling shortage.
    In areas where seedling rot has not occurred, attention should be paid to strengthening the management of seedling fields to prevent the occurrence of seedling rot:
    1. The location of the seedling field should be chosen in a relatively high, sheltered, and sunny place with harder soil. The preparation of the seedling field must be meticulous and level. If the location of the seedling field is too low, it will easily accumulate water and cause the seedlings to rot. Farmyard manure used in the seedling field must be fully decomposed, and green manure should be applied half a month before sowing.
    2. Timely irrigation and drainage to regulate the temperature of the seedling field. Based on changes in climate, master the techniques of irrigation and drainage at any time. Special attention is needed, especially within ten days after sowing, when the seedlings are young and tender. Generally, on sunny days, drainage should be carried out during the day, and shallow water should be irrigated at night. When it rains or is windy, the water level in the field must be raised to two or three inches deep to prevent the seedlings from being attacked by cold air or being blown down by the wind. In case of continuous cloudy and rainy weather, drain the water at any time, and immediately reduce the amount of water after the weather clears, so that the air is circulated, sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature is increased.
    3. Apply plant ash. Applying a layer of plant ash after sowing in the seedling field can absorb heat and keep it warm, and increase the ability of seedlings to resist adverse environments and germs. This is an effective measure to prevent seedling rot.
    4. Keep the seedling field clean to facilitate seedling development. Muddy water in the seedling field or rust can be clarified by first irrigating and then draining, or by sprinkling some plant ash. This will allow air to circulate, increase sunshine, and prevent hindering seedling development.
    In addition, healthy and full seeds must be selected before sowing. Seeds that have been flooded, are damp, carry germs, or are not fully mature are prone to mold. Therefore, selecting and retaining high-quality rice seeds, and selecting seeds with salt water and muddy water, is also an important part of preventing seed and seedling rot. At the same time, the soaking time should not be too long, and germination should not be too long.
    In short, there are many reasons for the formation of seedling rot, but most of them can be remedied or avoided by human effort. The broad masses of farmers in various regions have rich experience in preventing seedling rot. The agricultural departments of the leading organs at all levels and agricultural research institutions should further summarize, conduct experimental research, and promote them.

    注意防止水稻烂秧
    中央人民政府农业部粮食生产司
    根据最近报告，江南部分地区开始发生烂秧现象。各地农业部门应严重注意这个问题，积极采取有效措施，防止或减轻秧苗的损失，保证在栽苗时有足够的健壮秧苗。
    已经发生烂种、烂秧的地区，应发动群众互助互济，进行借秧、买秧、护秧、节秧，和及时设法进行补种，以解决缺秧的困难。
    凡是没有发生烂秧现象的地区，应注意加强秧田的管理，以防止烂秧情况的发生：
    1、秧田位置宜选择地势较高背风向阳而土质较硬的地方，秧田整地必须精细平坦。秧田位置如果过低，就容易积水引起秧苗腐烂。秧田施用厩肥必须充分腐熟，绿肥要在播种前半个月施下。
    2、及时灌溉排水，调节秧田温度。根据气候变化的情况，随时掌握灌溉排水技术。特别在播种后的十天以内，秧苗幼嫩，需要格外注意。一般晴天宜白天排水，夜晚灌浅水。遇到天雨或刮风时，须将田水加高到二、三寸深，以防幼苗为寒气侵袭，或被风吹倒。如遇阴雨连绵天气，应随时排水，天晴后立即将水量减少，使空气畅通，吸收阳光，增高温度。
    3、施用草木灰。秧田播种后施一层草木灰，可以吸热保温，增加秧苗抵抗不良环境及病菌的能力，这是防止烂秧的有效措施。
    4、保持秧田清洁，便于秧苗发育。秧田泥水混浊，生锈可采用先灌水后排水的办法，或撒些草木灰就可澄清。使空气流通，日照增强，不致妨碍秧苗发育。
    此外，在播种以前必须选择健全饱满的种子。凡遭受水淹潮湿，带病菌或成熟不充分的种子，往往容易发生霉烂现象。因此，选留优良稻种，并进行盐水和泥水选种，也是防止烂种烂秧的重要环节。同时浸种时间不宜过久，催芽不宜太长。
    总之，形成烂秧的原因是很多的，但绝大部分是可以用人力补救或避免的。各地农民群众都有丰富的防止烂秧的经验，各级领导机关的农业部门，及农业研究机关，应进一步加以总结，并进行试验研究，加以推广。
