The Central Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives issued a joint notice on April 1st regarding the need to quickly pay attention to solving cotton seed supply problems.

The joint notice pointed out: The cotton planting season is approaching. According to reports from some areas and feedback from the masses, there are still many problems in the preparation and supply of cotton seeds: (1) In some areas, due to excessive rainfall last autumn and serious pest and disease damage, cotton seeds did not mature well and had low germination rates. There is a great shortage of cotton seeds that can be used for planting. For example, the cotton seeds of various fine-variety ginning mills in northern Jiangsu have an average germination rate of only 50% to 65%. The Jinshi fine-variety ginning mill in Hunan also assessed that the average germination rate of cotton seeds in the area was only 50%. In the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, due to disaster-related production declines last year, the masses harvested many "dead cotton bolls" and are worried that "blind cotton seeds will not guarantee seedlings." (2) Some areas have not accurately grasped cotton seed plans, and there is blindness in the cotton seed allocation and supply work. For example, Tangzhuang in Ding County, Hebei Province, needs 20,000 catties of cotton seeds, but only 6,000 catties were supplied. Wangxiong Village in the second district of Fucheng County is short 200 mu of cotton seeds, and the problem had not been resolved by the end of March. However, some cotton farmers in Yihe Village in the first district of the county sold the excellent cotton seeds they could not use to oil presses. (3) The transportation and supply of cotton seeds in some areas are not timely, so the cotton seeds cannot be distributed to the masses in time. For example, in Hebei Province, only 36% of the planned amount of improved cotton seeds were transferred to grassroots cooperatives by mid-March, and only 20% were distributed to households. In addition, there are also instances of delayed distribution of cotton seeds in Liaocheng and Dezhou in Shandong Province. If the above problems are not corrected in time, they will affect the promotion of improved cotton varieties and the successful completion of planting tasks.

The joint notice requires agricultural departments and cooperative departments at all levels to quickly check the cotton seed preparation and supply situation in various localities, solve the cotton seed problems in a timely manner, and pay attention to the following: 1. In areas where the quantity of cotton seeds is insufficient or the quality is poor, each county can find ways to mutually adjust within the county according to the specific situation. Each special district and county should promptly report the number of cotton seeds lacking or surplus in their respective regions (referring to cotton seeds that can be used for planting). Adjustments between counties are the responsibility of the special district. Adjustments between special districts are the responsibility of the province. 2. When transferring cotton seeds from nearby areas, pay attention to transferring the same variety to avoid mixing varieties. 3. In areas where the quality of cotton seeds is poor or the germination rate is low, the masses should be called upon to carry out seed selection, screening, and water selection (when soaking seeds, use the buoyancy of water to remove immature or bad cotton seeds). Education should be combined with typical examples of reduced production due to missing seedlings to break the idea of cherishing seeds and appropriately increase the planting amount. However, if the germination rate is too low, it is necessary to exchange for good seeds nearby. 4. Special attention should be paid to in-depth inspection of areas that suffered serious disasters last year, and seed shortages should be resolved in a timely manner.

    中央农业部、合作社联合总社发出联合通知
    号召各地迅速注意解决棉种供应问题
    中央人民政府农业部、中华全国合作社联合总社于四月一日发出关于迅速注意解决棉种供应问题的联合通知。
    联合通知指出：棉花播种季节即将到来，根据部分地区的报告和群众反映的情况，在棉种准备和供应工作方面，目前仍有很多问题：（一）有些地区，由于去年秋季多雨，病虫为害严重，致使棉籽成熟不良，发芽率不高，能作种用的棉籽缺少很多。如苏北各良种轧花厂的棉种，发芽率平均仅在百分之五十至百分之六十五，湖南津市良种轧花厂鉴定该地区棉种的发芽率，平均也仅有百分之五十；陕西关中一带由于去年受灾减产，群众收了很多“死棉花疙瘩”，担心“瞎棉籽保不住苗”。（二）有些地区由于掌握棉种计划不够切实，在棉种调拨供应工作中，存在着盲目性。如河北省定县唐庄需用两万斤棉种，只供应了六千斤，阜城县二区王雄村缺二百亩的棉种，至三月底还没得到解决，但该县一区义和村有的棉农却将用不了的优良棉种卖给油房打油。（三）有些地区棉种的调运及供应不及时，因此，棉种不能及时发到群众手中。如河北省准备的优良棉种，在三月中旬调到基层合作社的仅占任务数的百分之三十六，分发到户的仅占任务数的百分之二十。另外山东省聊城、德州等地，也有拖延发放棉种的情形。上述这些问题，如不及时纠正，势将影响到棉花良种的推广及播种任务的胜利完成。
    联合通知要求各级农业部门和合作部门，迅速检查各地棉种准备情况和供应工作情况，及时解决棉种问题，并注意作好以下几件事情：一、在棉种数量缺、质量差的地区，各县可根据具体情况，自行设法在县内互相调剂：各专、县应将本地区棉种不足数或多余数（指可供播种用的棉子）及时上报。县与县之间的调剂由专区负责。专区间的调剂由省负责。二、从附近地区调剂棉种时要注意调剂同一品种，免使品种混杂。三、在棉种质量较差或发芽率较低的地区，应号召群众进行粒选、筛选、水选（实行浸种时，利用水的浮力，除掉不成熟或坏的棉种），并应结合由于缺苗而减产的典型事例教育群众，打破惜种思想，适当增加播种量。但发芽率过低时，则必须就近调换好种。四、对去年遭受严重灾害的地区，应特别注意深入检查，及时解决其种籽不足的问题。
