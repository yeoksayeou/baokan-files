Gansu Province Inspects Last Year's Projects, Finds Serious Waste

The Gansu Provincial People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau inspected nine major projects from last year in early February and discovered extremely serious waste. The failure to implement an economic accounting system was a common problem in all projects. The plans for many projects were constantly changing from the start of construction to completion. For example, Project No. 102 was originally estimated to cost only 500 million yuan, but so far, more than 1.4 billion yuan has been spent, and it is still not completed. There is no certainty as to how much more money will be needed to complete it. Waste was also very serious in the preparation and use of materials. Materials worth only 2 million yuan were budgeted at a unit price of 8 million yuan. Some units used expensive white cement for projects that could have been done with ordinary cement. Some units designed steel-reinforced concrete buildings on foundations only two meters deep. Soon after completion, ground subsidence and wall cracks were discovered. The phenomenon of poor project quality was very common. For example, Project No. 42 was riddled with holes and patches. One wall more than ten meters long was crooked and very unstable due to careless construction. However, to cover up these mistakes, the construction workers simply applied powder, smeared plaster, and patched it up. Project No. 102 placed a 140-meter-long concrete water pipe on uneven and alkali-laden mud. Now the water pipe frequently bursts, and repair costs alone have cost 100 million yuan.

Based on the problems discovered in the initial inspection, the Gansu Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau is continuing to conduct in-depth inspections and research.

    甘肃省检查去年工程
    发现浪费现象严重
    甘肃省人民政府建筑工程局，在二月初检查了去年的九个主要工程，发现浪费现象十分严重。没有贯彻经济核算制，是各工程普遍存在的问题。许多工程的计划，从动工到竣工，一直在变动。如一零二号工程，原来估计只要用五亿多元就行了，但是到现在已花去十四亿多元，还没有竣工，到底再要花多少钱才能竣工，还没有把握。在材料的准备和使用上，浪费现象也很严重。只值二百万元的材料，在预算中却开出八百万元的单价。有的单位把可以用普通水泥做的工程，用了价格高昂的白色水泥。有的单位把钢筋水泥结构的大楼，设计在只有两公尺深的基础上，竣工不久，就发现地基下沉和墙壁裂缝。工程质量低劣的现象很普遍，如四二号工程，到处挖洞补缝，有一个十多公尺的墙壁，因为施工草率，弄得弯腰弓背，十分不坚固；但是施工人员为掩饰这些错误，竟擦擦粉、抹抹灰，贴贴补补就算了。一零二号工程，把一条一百四十公尺长的水泥输水管放在高低不平和流着碱水的淤泥上，现在输水管经常破裂，光补修费就花了一亿几千万元。
    根据初步检查中发现的问题，甘肃省建筑工程局正在继续深入检查研究。
