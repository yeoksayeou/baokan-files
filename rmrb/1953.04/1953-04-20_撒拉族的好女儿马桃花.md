Ma Taohua, representing the women of the Salar ethnic group, came to Beijing from the Northwest to participate in the Second National Women's Congress of China.

In the past, the Salar people were one of the most oppressed ethnic minorities. Ma Taohua, along with the tragic fate of her people, spent many years performing unpaid labor in the homes of landlords of other ethnic groups. It was not until the Communist Party liberated the Salar people that Ma Taohua was freed from her enslaved life. In the past three years, under the care and cultivation of the Party and the People's Government, she has contributed all her wisdom and energy to the people of all ethnic groups. The people of eight ethnic groups—Salar, Dongxiang, Bao'an, Hui, Uyghur, Tu, Tibetan, and Han—in the Dahejia area praise her as a good daughter of the Salar people. Currently, she is the Deputy Township Head of Sibaozi Township, Dahejia District, Linxia County, Gansu Province.

In this multi-ethnic region, Ma Taohua has consistently assisted cadres in actively promoting the various policies of the People's Government to the masses, maintaining public order, promoting production, helping military families solve their difficulties, and mediating ethnic disputes. She works tirelessly from morning till night, even when her feet are swollen. Once, she went to the county People's Government to report on her work and returned during a heavy rain, walking one hundred and twenty li on the muddy road. Ma Taohua said, "I have never felt any hardship in my work."

The People's Government attaches particular importance to ethnic unity work in areas with numerous ethnic groups. Ma Taohua understands this and has implemented the policy of ethnic equality and unity in every aspect of her work. In the spring of 1952, when land reform was about to be carried out in the Dahejia District, there were still signs of disunity among the various ethnic groups here. She first persuaded the Hui and Bao'an ethnic groups, who had deeper ethnic divisions, first clearing the minds of the Hui people, and then going to Bao'an Village three times in a row to persuade them. The third time, she talked from early morning until the cock crowed in the deep night, and the hearts of the Bao'an people were touched. The people of the two ethnic groups then held a unity meeting. At that time, the people of the Bao'an ethnic group said to Ma Taohua: "You have helped the people of our two ethnic groups tear down the old windows and replace them with new ones." In this way, the land reform work was successfully completed in ethnic unity.

After the land reform, Ma Taohua always remembered the families of Han people who had fled to Xunhua County in Qinghai Province due to ethnic disputes when they were first liberated. She said to the masses of the Salar ethnic group: "We have been allocated land, and we cannot allow the families of Han people who have fled to other places to not even have a tile to their name." She mobilized some of the Salar and Hui people, harnessed large carts, and gathered a mule team to move Qin Gayan and several other Han families back from Xunhua County, so that they could also be allocated land and houses.

Ma Taohua strengthens the unity of the people of all ethnic groups from all aspects and solves their difficulties. Last year, the farmers of all ethnic groups who had been allocated land launched a production competition with great enthusiasm. The Hui people in the Third Administrative Village were too far from the river and needed to dig a canal to draw water, but they had few people and little strength. Ma Taohua then mobilized more than thirty Han people from outside the village and led them to dig a ten-li-long canal for the Hui people, irrigating their fields.

Ma Taohua's excellent qualities of loving the masses and faithfully serving the people of all ethnic groups have moved the people of all ethnic groups in the Dahejia District. Whenever she goes to a village, the masses surround her and say to her: "Ma Taohua, you have come and brought us solutions to our problems. Are these solutions your ideas, or the ideas of the Communist Party and the People's Government?" The simple and modest Ma Taohua said to them: "These are the ideas of the Communist Party and the People's Government. I have learned these methods and will pass them on to you to help you unite and live a good life." Hearing these words, the masses love the Party and the People's Government even more.

Last year, after the land reform in Sibaozi Township, the township People's Congress was held to elect the township head. Among the nominated candidates, representatives of all ethnic groups cast all their votes for Ma Taohua, electing her as the Deputy Township Head of the township.

    撒拉族的好女儿马桃花
    新华社记者  李开顺
    马桃花代表撒拉民族的妇女，从西北来到北京，参加了中国第二次全国妇女代表大会。
    撒拉族过去是个最受压迫的少数民族，马桃花随着自己民族的悲惨命运，长年在其他民族的地主家里进行无偿劳动。直到共产党解放了撒拉民族，马桃花才摆脱了被奴役的生活。三年来，她在党和人民政府的爱护和培养下，为各族人民贡献了自己全副的智慧和精力。大河家区的撒拉、东乡、保安、回、维、土、藏、汉八个民族人民，都称赞她是撒拉民族的好女儿。现在，她是甘肃省临夏县大河家区四堡子乡的副乡长。
    在这个多民族的地区，马桃花几年来一直帮助干部，积极向群众宣传人民政府的各项政策，维持治安，推动生产，帮助军属解决困难，调解民族纠纷。她从早到晚，脚也跑肿了，仍不间歇地工作着。一次，她到县人民政府去汇报工作，回来时，下着大雨，她在激雨泥路中徒步走了一百二十里路。马桃花说：我在工作中，从来没有感觉到苦。
    人民政府在民族众多的地区，特别重视民族团结工作，马桃花体会到这点，她在每一项工作中都贯彻了民族平等团结的政策。一九五二年春天，大河家区将要进行土地改革时，这里的各个民族仍有不团结的现象。她首先向民族隔阂较深的回族和保安族进行说服工作，先打通了回族群众的思想，然后接连三进保安村进行劝说。第三次，她从清早说到深夜鸡叫，保安族群众的心，被她打动了，两族群众开了团结会。当时保安族的群众向马桃花说：你帮助我们两族人民将旧窗子拆掉，将新窗子换上了。这样，土地改革工作在民族团结中顺利完成。
    土地改革后，马桃花始终惦念着刚解放时因民族纠纷逃到青海循化县的几户汉民，她对撒拉族的群众说：“我们分到了土地，不能叫逃到外地的几户汉民连一片瓦都没有。”她发动了撒拉族和回族的一部分群众，套上大车，合起马帮，到循化县将秦尕彦几户汉民搬回来，使他们同样分到了土地和房屋。
    马桃花从各个方面去加强各族人民的团结，解决各族人民的困难。去年分到土地的各族农民，热火朝天地开展了生产竞赛。第三行政村的回民离河太远，要挖渠引水，但人少力薄，马桃花便发动了外村三十多个汉民，由她带头去给回民掏挖了十里长的一条水渠，使回民的田地灌满了水。
    马桃花热爱群众、忠实地为各族人民服务的优良品质，感动了大河家区的各民族人民。她每到一个村庄，群众就把她包围起来对她说：马桃花，你来了，就给我们带来了解决问题的办法。这些办法是你想出来的，还是共产党、人民政府想出的？朴实谦虚的马桃花对他们说：“这是共产党和人民政府想出的办法，我学会了这些办法，再传达给你们，帮助你们团结起来过好生活。”群众听了这些话，更加热爱党和人民政府。
    去年四堡子乡进行土地改革后，召开乡人民代表大会，选举该乡乡长，在被提名的候选人中，各民族的代表，给马桃花投了全票，选举她为该乡的副乡长。
