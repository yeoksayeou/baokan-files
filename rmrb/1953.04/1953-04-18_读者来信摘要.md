Reader's Letters Summary

    Jin County Cooperative's Irresponsible Work
    Waste of People's Property Creates a Negative Impact

    A reader from Jin County, Hebei Province writes: Li Songyin, the director of the Jin County Cooperative in Hebei Province, is severely bureaucratic, causing great losses to the people's property. Last winter, the cooperative received a large quantity of corn allocated by the Grain Bureau, but after it was put into storage, they considered the matter finished and did not inspect or manage it well. This batch of corn contained 16% moisture when it arrived, and by spring, the moisture evaporated, causing it to rot. The cooperative not only did not actively try to salvage it but adopted an attitude of indifference to state property. The storekeeper pushed responsibility to the section chief, the section chief to the director, and the director to the Grain Bureau, shifting responsibility to each other and no one caring. It was not until the Jin County People's Government discovered this that County Head Zhang Zhuomin personally led cadres to salvage it; but it was too late, and 50,000 jin of corn had already rotted.

    In late March, the Shijiazhuang Special District Cooperative instructed the Jin County Cooperative to transfer 50,000 jin of "Si Zi No. 4" good cotton seeds to Shulu County. This was a major matter concerning farmers' production, but the cooperative again adopted an extremely negative bureaucratic attitude. The storekeeper, Liu Bingyi, confusedly took cotton seeds from the inferior seed warehouse and packed them into bags. It was only when 200 bags (totaling 20,000 jin) had been packed that the mistake was discovered; but by then, 15,000 jin had already been shipped. Liu Bingyi immediately reported to Director Li Songyin and others, who actually said: "Just pack the bad seeds; it will be hard to tell the difference when they are mixed!" As a result, all 20,000 jin of inferior seeds were shipped to the Shulu County Cooperative. When farmers saw that this batch of cotton seeds was a mess, they were very dissatisfied. The Shulu County Cooperative reported the situation to the special district, and after inspection, it was learned that the Jin County Cooperative was responsible. Thus, the other 30,000 jin of selected good seeds were also mixed with inferior seeds. As a result, the Jin County Cooperative had to transport another 50,000 jin of good cotton seeds, causing serious losses to the people's property.

    An Unmanaged Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School

    Gao Jihou and Wang Jialin, Chairman of the Student Union of Harbin Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School, write: Our Harbin Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School was established in 1950 and was originally under the leadership of the Harbin Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education. In August 1952, the central government announced the decision to attach Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools to universities, which made all the students very happy. At the Northeast Education Department's transfer conference for Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools last November, it was officially decided that our school would be transferred to Harbin Institute of Technology as an affiliated school. On January 4th of this year, the former Northeast Education Department issued a clear notice to Harbin Institute of Technology and the Harbin Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, stipulating that the handover should be completed from February 25th to March 5th. During this period, our school principal, who is also the deputy director of the Harbin Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, contacted Harbin Institute of Technology more than ten times, but the leaders of the university always delayed handling the issue of taking over the Harbin Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School. The Harbin Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, however, transferred teachers according to regulations. The Harbin Municipal Party Committee also transferred the full-time deputy general secretary. Since March, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has stopped official funding, and our school's scholarships and office expenses for March were still temporarily borrowed. Until the end of March, our school was still a school without leadership from a higher-level organization. Teachers and students are experiencing great ideological fluctuations, seriously affecting the normal progress of learning and work.

    Entrusting Units to Support Construction Units
    To Jointly Improve Basic Construction Work

    Sun Wenle from the Beijing Municipal Construction Trade Union writes: In the country's large-scale construction work, basic construction has been elevated to a primary position. Currently, the tasks of basic construction work are heavy, but construction units lack sufficient cadre strength, and issues such as construction workers' welfare, recreation, and medical care have not been fully resolved. Under these circumstances, some entrusting units in Beijing are vigorously supporting construction units and assisting in solving these problems, which has yielded good results. For example, the Engineering Company directly under the former Ministry of Construction Engineering is responsible for the construction of the Air Force Hospital. The entrusting unit has sent four cadres to participate in the administrative management of the construction site and has also sent personnel to be responsible for the security of the construction site. Most of the administrative management cadres at the Marxism-Leninism Institute construction site are appointed by the entrusting unit. Students from the Foreign Language School, to thank the worker comrades who built the building for them, voluntarily teach workers culture and help them with recreational activities in their spare time. The Third Engineering Company of Beijing lacks workers' dormitories, which affects the start of construction; the Military Commission has lent tents to serve as workers' dormitories. At a construction site of the First Engineering Company, the entrusting unit, Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, sent medical personnel to be responsible for workers' medical and health issues. … The above practices not only effectively help construction units solve certain difficulties but also greatly encourage the production enthusiasm of construction workers.

    This approach may have already existed in other regions; but I believe it should be vigorously promoted in the future so that entrusting units, where conditions permit, help construction units in all aspects to facilitate the progress of basic construction work.

    Suggestions on Further Promoting
    Standardized Design in Basic Construction

    Sun Dingyi, Shen Kuixu, and three others from the Design Technology Office of the Design Institute of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, write: Currently, the design capacity for basic construction is insufficient, and all parties are actively seeking solutions. We suggest further adopting and promoting standardized design to improve design efficiency.

    The issue of standardized design was preliminarily stipulated in the First National Construction Engineering Conference in July last year. Some design units have formulated standard doors and windows, standard precast concrete slabs, standard stairs, standard trusses, and other standard components, and standard drawings for various civil buildings. Standard components are used as much as possible in the individual design of special buildings, and according to actual needs, they constantly find rules based on the principles of standardized design and generate new standard component drawings at any time and place. Experience has proven that designs using standardized design methods and standard components can save approximately 30% to 50% of design manpower, greatly shorten the design time, and ensure the quality of the design. It can also advance the start date, solve the problem of idle work; and make certain unified standard components (such as various doors and windows, precast concrete slabs, etc.) can be produced before the entire building design has been formulated, which not only partially solves the current phenomenon of idle work but also alleviates the difficulties of rushing work in the future, allowing the project to be completed ahead of schedule.

    However, this work has not been universally promoted in various construction units, and much manpower and time are wasted on repetitive design work. Therefore, we suggest that construction management departments attach importance to the issue of standardized design and vigorously promote it.

    A Unified System of
    Weights and Measures Should Be Used in a Book

    Comrade Pang Zhongshen, a medical worker from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, writes: We constantly receive medical and health books sent from all parts of the motherland in Korea, which solve many difficulties in our work. However, I have found that some books use inconsistent units of weights and measures within the same book, which causes great difficulties for us in our research. For example, the book "How to Use Pharmaceuticals to Prevent and Control Disease-Carrying Pests" (compiled by the Pharmaceutical Group of the North China Insect Work Committee, printed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, published in June 1952) uses different units and names for weights and measures such as "mu," "shi mu," "square meters," "square feet," "square shi chi," "square chi," "millimeters," "cubic feet," "jin," "shi jin," "liang," "qian," "gong cuo," "gram," and "shi sheng." Another example is the book "How to Eliminate Poisonous Insects" (compiled by Zhong Linxian, published by Northeast Medical Book Publishing House in August 1952). Page 6 lists fourteen chemical methods for exterminating fly maggots, and almost every method uses different units of weights and measures. Are mu and shi mu, jin and shi jin, square chi and square shi chi equal? What are the ratios between the various weights and measures? Some people don't know, and those who do know need a certain amount of time to calculate, which wastes time. These types of books are popular books, and more consideration should be given to the convenience of the readers. It is suggested that comrades who compile similar books try to unify the "weights and measures" in the same book as much as possible, using "metric system" so that readers can read easily.

    Editor's note: The problem raised by Comrade Pang Zhongshen's letter deserves the attention of various publishing agencies. Currently, not only some medical and health books use inconsistent systems of weights and measures in one book, but similar situations also exist in other scientific and technological books. This makes many readers feel very inconvenient. Unifying the system of weights and measures is a complex issue that requires good research. However, it is best to use a unified system of weights and measures in the same book and indicate the ratio when using other systems of weights and measures.

    Shandong Province Huxi Prefectural Commissioner's Office Seriously Handles
    Cases of Death Caused by Forced Collection in Autumn Grain Collection

    Gao Fengzhang writes: The "Economic Work Review" column in the People's Daily on March 18 pointed out that we should "resolutely correct the deviations in the agricultural tax collection work," which is very important. Now I will tell you about a case of death caused by forced collection in the collection of public grain and its handling. During the autumn grain collection in 1952, the village chief Li Shikui of Shierlimiao Village, the first district of Juye County, Huxi Special District, Shandong Province, deceived the masses and used an old scale of 98 jin to represent 100 shi jin to collect public grain. The farmer Li Ruyun thought it was unreasonable, and the two had an argument. Afterwards, Li Ruyun was afraid of retaliation and asked the villager Li Jincai to apologize to Li Shikui on his behalf. The next day, Li Ruyun discussed with Li Ruzhen, the platoon leader of the village, to use a standard scale to collect public grain for his platoon. Li Shikui was very dissatisfied and wanted to convene a mass meeting that night, and told the militia squad leader Li Yufeng:
    "Whoever makes trouble, tie them up and send them to the district." Li Ruyun knew about this and was so frightened that he hanged himself in the cypress forest southwest of the village that day.

    After the incident, the Juye County People's Government, People's Court, and People's Procuratorate, together with the District People's Government, formed an investigation team to investigate the facts in the village. Li Shikui was immediately arrested, condolences were given to the family of the deceased, a mass meeting was held to expose the evils of Li Shikui, and the policies were explained, and the overcollected grain was returned to the masses. Afterwards, the Huxi Special Commissioner's Office conducted two more investigations into the case and put forward the following handling opinions: 1. The village chief Li Shikui's style of forcing orders was serious, he consistently oppressed the masses, and threatened Li Ruyun, resulting in a suicide incident. He should be sentenced to imprisonment according to law. 2. The cadres of the District People's Government listened one-sidedly to the reports of the village cadres, did not go deep into understanding the specific situation, and condoned Li Shikui's illegal behavior; even when the higher-level People's Government investigated Li Ruyun's suicide, Xu Jie, the civil affairs assistant of the district, said that the village cadres were not at fault. Shang Mingzao, the cadre responsible for the autumn grain collection work in the village, had not been to Shierlimiao Village since the deployment of the autumn grain collection work, and he did not even know about Li Ruyun's suicide until three days after the incident. Therefore, Han Fuming, the district chief of the district, Xu Jie, the civil affairs assistant, and Shang Mingzao, the autumn grain collection cadre, should all conduct profound self-criticism and be appropriately punished according to their respective situations. 3. When the Juye County Grain Bureau calibrated Li Shikui's scale, it mistakenly marked the old scale of 98 jin to represent 100 jin as "this scale is 100 jin to represent 100 jin," giving Li Shikui an opportunity to oppress the masses. The bureau should check the responsibility and deal with the relevant cadres. The Juye County People's Government should also use this incident to check and improve its work.

    The approach of the Huxi Special Commissioner's Office is serious and necessary. Other regions where similar incidents have occurred in the work of collecting public grain should also select typical incidents for handling to educate cadres and improve work.

    读者来信摘要
    晋县合作社工作不负责任
    浪费人民财产造成恶劣影响
    河北省晋县一读者来信：河北省晋县合作社主任李松阴官僚主义严重，使人民财产受到很大损失。该社在去年冬季接收粮食局拨来大批玉米，但入库后就万事大吉，没有很好检查保管。这批玉米来时含有百分之十六的水分，到春季水分蒸发，发生霉烂。该社不但不积极抢救，反而采取了对国家资财漠不关心的态度，管库员推科长，科长推主任，主任推粮食局，互相推诿，大家不管。直到晋县人民政府发现后，张卓民县长亲自率领干部抢救；但时间已晚，霉烂玉米五万斤。
    三月下旬，石家庄专区合作社指示晋县合作社调往束鹿县“斯字四号”良棉种籽五万斤。这是一件有关农民生产的大事，但该社又采取了极端恶劣的官僚主义态度。管库员刘秉义糊里糊涂地把劣籽库的棉籽拿出来装包，装了二百口袋（共二万斤）时才发现错了；但是那时已运走了一万五千斤。刘秉义马上向李松阴主任等请示，李松阴等竟说：“装上坏籽算了吧，一混也就难看出来了！”这样，两万斤劣籽全都运到束鹿县合作社，束鹿县合作社发到各村，农民见这批棉籽乱七八糟，大为不满。束鹿县合作社把情况报告专区，经检查，才知是晋县合作社的责任。这样，其它三万斤选出的良种也混进劣籽，结果晋县合作社又重运了五万斤好棉籽去，使人民财产受到严重损失。
    一个没人管的工农速成中学
    哈尔滨工农速成中学学生会主席高继厚、王佳琳来信：我们哈尔滨工农速成中学是在一九五○年成立的，原由哈尔滨市文教局领导。一九五二年八月，中央公布了关于工农速成中学附设于高等学校的决定，全校同学十分高兴。去年十一月原东北教育部召开的工农速成中学移交会议上正式决定我校移交于哈尔滨工业大学附设，今年一月四日，原东北教育部又明文通知哈尔滨工业大学和哈尔滨市文教局，规定从二月二十五日至三月五日接交完毕。我校校长、哈尔滨市文教局副局长在此期间曾到哈尔滨工业大学联系十余次，但该校领导同志对接办哈尔滨工农速成中学问题总是拖延不办。而哈尔滨市文教局却按规定调走了教员。中共哈尔滨市委会也调走了专职的副总支书记。三月份起市文教局又停止正式拨款，我校三月份的助学金和办公费还是临时借用的。直到三月底，我校还是一个没有上级机关领导的学校。教职员和学生思想波动很厉害，严重地影响了学习和工作的正常进行。
    委托单位支援施工单位
    共同搞好基本建设工作
    北京市建筑工会孙文乐来信：在国家大规模建设工作中，基本建设已被提到首要地位。目前基本建设工作任务大，但施工单位干部力量不足，建筑工人的福利、文娱、医药等问题尚不能完全得到解决。在这种情况下，北京市有些委托单位就大力支援施工单位，协助解决这些问题，收到很好效果。如原建筑工程部直属工程公司负责施工空军医院，委托单位派出四个干部参加工地的行政管理工作，并派人负责工地的警卫安全工作。马列学院工地的行政管理干部，大部由委托单位派任。外国语学校同学为了感谢给他们盖大楼的工人同志，主动地在课余时间教工人学文化、帮工人搞文娱活动。北京市第三工程公司缺少工人宿舍，影响开工；军委就借出了帐篷作工人宿舍。第一工程公司某工地上，委托单位北京苏联红十字医院派出医务人员负责工人医疗卫生问题。……以上这种做法，不但有效地帮助施工单位解决了某些方面的困难，而且也大大鼓舞了建筑工人的生产热情。
    这种做法可能其他地区也已经有过；但我认为今后应大力推广，使委托单位在条件可能的情况下，在各方面帮助施工单位，以利基本建设工作的进行。
    建议在基本建设中进一步
    推广设计标准化
    中央建筑工程部设计院设计技术室孙定一、沈奎绪等五人来信：目前基本建设设计能力不足，各方面已经积极设法解决。我们建议进一步采用并推广设计标准化来提高设计效率。
    关于设计标准化的问题，在去年七月第一次全国建筑工程会议中已有了初步的规定。有一部分设计单位并已制定了标准门窗、标准预制混凝土板、标准楼梯、标准房架等标准部件，和各种民用建筑的标准图样；在特殊建筑个别设计中也尽量利用了标准部件，并按实际需要根据设计标准化的原则不断地找出规律，随时随地产生新的标准部件图样。经验证明：凡采用设计标准化方法及采用标准部件进行的设计，可以节省设计人力约百分之三十至五十，大大缩短了设计的时间，保证了设计的质量。还可以使开工时间提早，解决窝工问题；并使某些统一的标准部件（如各种门窗，预制混凝土板梁等）在整个建筑设计还未制定时，就可以进行生产，不但部分解决目前窝工的现象，而且可以减轻将来抢工的困难，使工程提前完成。
    但是，这方面的工作在各建筑单位中还没有普遍推广，不少人力与时间浪费于重复设计工作中。因此，我们建议建筑管理部门重视设计标准化的问题，大力推广。
    在一本书中应该用统一的
    度量衡制度
    中国人民志愿军某部医务工作者庞仲深同志来信：我们在朝鲜不断接到来自祖国各地寄来的医学卫生书籍，为我们解决了好多工作中的困难问题。但是我发现有些书在同书中使用度量衡单位不统一，使我们在研究时发生很大困难。如“怎样使用药剂来防治病媒害虫”（华北昆虫工作委员会药剂组编，中国科学院印，一九五二年六月出版）一书中所使用的度量衡就有“亩”、“市亩”、“平方公尺”、“平方呎”、“平方市尺”、“平方尺”、“公厘”、“立方尺”、“斤”、“市斤”、“两”、“钱”、“公撮”、“克”、“市升”等不同单位和名称。又如“怎样消灭毒虫”（钟林贤编著，东北医学图书出版社一九五二年八月出版）一书，第六页列举扑灭蝇蛆的化学方法十四个，几乎每个方法中所用的度量衡单位都不相同。亩与市亩、斤与市斤、平方尺与平方市尺等是否相等？各个度量衡互相的比值是啥？有些人不知道，知道的人也需要一定时间才能计算出来，这就浪费了时间。这类书籍是通俗性的书籍，更应考虑读者的方便。建议编著类似书籍的同志在同一书中的“度量衡”尽量统一起来，都用“公制”，使读者阅读方便。
    编者按：庞仲深同志来信提出的问题值得各
    出版机关注意。目前出版物中，不但有些医药
    卫生的书籍，在一书中所用度量衡制度不统
    一，在其它科学技术书籍中也有类似情况。这
    使很多读者感到很不方便。统一度量衡制度是
    一个复杂的问题，需要很好研究。但目前在同
    一本书内最好用统一的度量衡制度，在用其它
    度量衡制度时应该注明比值。
    山东省湖西专署严肃处理
    秋征工作中逼死人命案件
    高凤璋来信：三月十八日人民日报“经济工作述评”栏指出应该“坚决纠正农业税征收工作中的偏向”，这是很重要的。现在我告诉你们一件征收公粮中逼死人命案件及其处理经过。山东省湖西专区钜野县第一区十二里庙村在一九五二年秋征期间，村长李世魁欺骗群众，用九十八斤顶一百市斤的老秤收公粮。农民李如云认为不合理，二人发生争吵。事后，李如云怕报复，曾托村民李金财向李世魁道歉。次日，李如云商同本住民排排长李如贞改用标准秤收本排的公粮。李世魁大为不满，当天晚上便要召开群众会议，并和民兵班长李玉峰说：
    “谁捣乱绑上送区。”李如云知道了，当天就害怕得在村子西南柏树林自缢。
    事件发生后，钜野县人民政府、人民法院和人民检察署会同该区人民政府组成调查组到该村查明事实后，即将李世魁逮捕，对死者家属进行慰问，并召开群众会议揭发李世魁的罪恶，讲明政策，把多收的粮食退还群众。其后，湖西专署对此案又作了两次调查，并提出如下处理意见：一、村长李世魁强迫命令作风严重，一贯欺压群众，并威胁李如云，致发生自杀事件，应依法判处徒刑。二、该区人民政府干部片面听信村干部报告，不深入了解具体情况，纵容李世魁违法行为；甚至在上级人民政府调查李如云自杀事件时，区民政助理员许杰还说村干部没有错误。负责该村秋征工作的干部商明凿，自布置秋征工作以来未到十二里庙村去过，甚至在李如云自杀事件发生三天后他还不知道。因此，该区区长韩复明、民政助理员许杰和秋征干部商明凿都应进行深刻检讨，并分别情况受到适当处分。三、钜野县粮食局在给李世魁校秤时，误把九十八斤顶一百斤的老秤标成“此秤一百斤顶一百斤”，使李世魁有空子欺压群众。该局应检查责任，对有关干部进行处理。钜野县人民政府也应通过这一事件，检查和改进工作。
    湖西专署这种做法是严肃而必要的。在征收公粮工作中发生类似事件的其它地区也应该选择典型事件进行处理，以教育干部，改进工作。
