    The Great Four Years
   ——Written to Commemorate the Fourth Anniversary of the People's Liberation Army's Crossing of the Yangtze River
    Bai Hua
    There is a spring that will never be forgotten, and that is the spring four years ago, April 20th. The People's Liberation Army was still watering its horses on the northern bank of the Yangtze River. Tomorrow, the historical operation that would determine the victory of the Chinese people—crossing the Yangtze River by force—would commence. The People's Liberation Army, gathered on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, was busy all night long: the assault troops were pulling boats to the riverbank from the ground; the artillerymen were laboriously moving the cannons, aiming at the opposite bank, through the reflected light of the waves on the river surface; the commanders stood in the face of the river wind, watching the front—the place where they would land tomorrow; the soldiers were discussing: "Be light when boarding the boat, aim accurately when shooting, land steadily, and pursue fiercely"; the sailors were testing the sails; the cooks were making the last "Jiangbei meal" for the soldiers crossing the river; the civilian laborers accompanying the army were packing up stretchers; and the villagers from Jiangbei were transporting grain, sending grass, and sending condolences to the riverbank, as well as the brocade banner embroidered with "Cross the Yangtze River and Liberate All of China"—this was embroidered with the wishes of the people of the whole country.
    On April 21st, the heroic people's soldiers realized the people's hope, defeated the enemy, and crossed China's largest river—the Yangtze River.
    In the same spring, we had already arrived in Jiangnan. The villagers in the old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi took out the old revolutionary base currency and Red Army family certificates that they had preserved through so much suffering. During the long dark period of White rule, these red souvenirs were their hope, and that hope was finally realized! Many of their children were "little devils" when they left home, but today they are commanders leading troops across the Yangtze River. Many Red Army mothers, with tears in their eyes, raised their glasses and excitedly exhorted their children: "Children! Avenge us! Let the sky that was red for a while be forever red with brilliance!" The People's Liberation Army advanced bravely in the rainy spring of Jiangnan!
    Another spring, amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Southwest, the People's Liberation Army advanced to the last frontier of the motherland. The process from one spring to another is just like a concise and vivid gun poem describes:
    "On the banks of the Yangtze River, sails are hung,
    The cannons rumble as they board the boats,
    Crossing the Yangtze River, a natural barrier;
    Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line,
    Crossing the Five Ridges, mountain after mountain,
    Take the Guangdong-Hankou line, along the coast to the southwest,
    Guangdong-Guangxi border, an amazing pursuit,
    More than six hundred in four days, an average of one hundred and fifty-three a day;
    Ten Thousand Mountains, Zhennanguan,
    Eliminating the remnants of bandits in southern Yunnan."
    The People's Liberation Army achieved victory in advancing to the southwestern frontier of the motherland, but this is by no means the final victory. Imperialism has not stopped their aggression for a minute. They support and raise Kuomintang bandits, like a group of vicious mad dogs, taking advantage of the border guards' unsteady footing, they窜犯the border and continue to create bloodshed in China. They chopped off the newborns in front of Akha women in labor; they烙died elders in the Dai people's坝zi; they剖opened the wombs of pregnant women in the Yi people's寨zi; they勒died Yao men in the forests... They greedily snatched away cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, and everything they could drag away, without even leaving a bowl of rice...
    So the border guards announced to the people of all ethnic groups:
    "We are sent by Chairman Mao! We fight for the people of all ethnic groups!" They began to share weal and woe with the people of all ethnic groups. The border guard soldiers took off their military uniforms and wrapped up the orphans who had lost their mothers and were covered in blood; they saved their own rice and cooked thin porridge with the people of all ethnic groups.
    On a cliff of a hundred zhang, soldier Li Lianxing was wrestling with a bandit leader. The bandit leader begged him to release him and promised to give him gold bars, otherwise they would die together. At that moment, the soldier decided his own life and death. He resolutely chose the glorious path that gold could not buy and fell into the turbulent Lancang River with the bandit leader.
    On the way to deliver a letter, signalman Huang Guisheng single-handedly pounced on three bandits who were torturing a Dai child. He killed the bandits, but he also fell beside the child, and the child hugged him and cried incessantly...
    Many troops fought in the primitive forests for months, without light, relying on the phosphorescence of rotten wood to light the way; they stepped over the grass slopes covered with bamboo spikes by the bandits; they扑went to the volcanoes lit by the bandits; they爬climbed into the dangerous stone caves. All the difficulties, the people's army overcame, and conquered!
    The second spring of the frontier came, and the border guards escorted the government's caravans, delivering salt and goods to remote villages; the border guards helped the disaster-stricken people of all ethnic groups to plant rice seedlings on the barren land; the border guards presided over the reconciliation wine parties between ethnic groups on the hills. At the wine parties, the border guard soldiers and the people of all ethnic groups drank three cups of chicken blood wine together and swore an oath:
    "If the mountain shakes, we will not shake,
    If the earth moves, we will not move!"
    On the basis of unity, the border guards helped the people of all ethnic groups organize self-defense joint defense forces. The people of all ethnic groups picked up knives, spears, bows, and crossbows, and fought together with the border guards to eliminate the last remnant enemy within the border.
    The third spring of the frontier came, and the border guard soldiers smelled the fragrance of magnolias and saw the variety of camellias for the first time. But the border guards did not stop to rest. With a gun in one hand and a shovel in the other, they opened up roads, built bridges, constructed houses, and built water conservancy projects on the Hengduan Mountains; they taught the people of all ethnic groups how to cultivate the land to get more harvest; how to build houses that are strong and have sunlight; how to raise cattle and sheep to make them fat; how to teach their children to read and write; how to stand guard and be vigilant against imperialist aggression.
    This year's spring came the earliest, and hundreds of flowers bloomed around the border guards' camp. The northern crops planted by the northern soldiers grew luxuriantly. In the spring mountains and fields, the sounds of Miao flutes, Lusheng, four-stringed instruments, and two-stringed instruments echoed; the sound of flowing water, singing, whistling, the chirping of hundreds of birds, and the crisp sound of cowbells in the paddy fields were intertwined, like a chapter of an unfinished symphony, so harmonious and so beautiful. At night, joyful lights burned in the thatched huts and deep in the forests. How quiet! The sound of a girl singing love songs in a low voice to her lover beside the field shed or water mortar can be heard. People have never been so comfortable, treating the night as day. The people of all ethnic groups hardly remember that this was once a barren mountain, and that here, the sounds of crying and killing once rang out for months and years...
    However, such a victory did not make the border guards feel the slightest complacency. In this beautiful spring, on every ordinary night, when the mothers of the border guard soldiers are dreaming of meeting their heroic children, everything in the motherland is sweetly asleep, so peaceful... But the border guard soldiers are awake! They are watching those places where cold shots are fired with their eyes fixed, listening quietly to the uneasy sounds that others will not hear, and the soldiers' hearts beat with those strange sounds...
    One flower is more beautiful than another; one spring is more beautiful than another. Spring is the beginning of the motherland's large-scale peaceful construction year, and it is also the beginning of the border guard soldiers' more vigilant defense of the border. The great motherland is striding forward in the spring!

    伟大的四年间
   ——为纪念人民解放军渡江四周年而作
    白桦
    有一个永远不会被人遗忘的春天，就是四年前的春天，四月二十日，解放军还饮马长江北岸，明天就要举行决定中国人民胜利的历史作战——强渡长江。云集在长江北岸的解放军，通宵忙碌着：突击队员们从地面上把船拉到江边；炮兵们透过江面波涛的反光，吃力地运动着大炮，向对岸瞄准；指挥员在扑面江风中伫立，注视着前面——明天就要由那里登岸的地方；战士们在讨论：“上船要轻，射击要准，登岸要稳，追击要猛”；水手们在试帆；炊事员在给渡江战士作最后一次“江北饭”；随军民工们在收拾担架；江北的老乡们在往江沿上运粮、送草、送慰问品，还有绣着“打过长江去，解放全中国”的锦旗——这是绣着全国人民的心愿。
    四月二十一日，英勇的人民战士，实现了人民的希望，战胜了敌人，渡过了中国最大河流——长江。
    同一个春天，我们已经到了江南。江西老革命根据地的乡亲们，拿出了忍受过多少苦难才保存下来的老革命根据地的纸币和红军家属证。在长期黑暗的白色势力统治时期，这些红色的纪念品就是他们的希望，希望终于实现了！他们的很多子弟离家时还是“小鬼”，而今天已经是麾军打过长江的指挥员了。多少红军妈妈含泪举杯，兴奋地向子弟们叮咛着：“孩子们！报仇吧！让我们红过一时的天，永远红光万丈！”解放军在多雨的江南春天，勇猛前进！
    又一个春天，在大西南凯歌声中，解放军挺进到祖国的最后边疆。一个春天到一个春天的过程，正像一首简练而生动的枪杆诗所描写的那样：
    “长江岸，挂风帆，
    大炮隆隆登上船，
    渡过了长江天险；
    京沪杭，浙赣线，
    越过五岭重重山，
    走粤汉，顺着海岸向西南，
    粤桂边，惊人的追歼战，
    四天六百多，平均一天一百五十三；
    十万大山镇南关，
    消灭残匪在滇南。”
    解放军取得了挺进祖国西南边疆的胜利，但这绝不是最后的胜利。帝国主义没有一分钟停止他们的侵略活动，他们支持和豢养着国民党残匪，像一群穷凶极恶的疯狗，乘边防军立足未稳，窜犯国境，继续在中国制造着血案。他们在阿卡族产妇面前剁死初生的婴儿；他们在傣人坝子里烙死长者；他们在彝人寨子里剖开孕妇的肚子；他们在树林里勒死瑶人的汉子……他们贪婪地抢走牛、马、羊、猪和一切能够拖走的东西，就连一碗米也不留下……。
    于是边防军向各族人民宣布：
    “我们是毛主席派来的！我们为各族人民而战！”开始与各族人民同甘苦，共患难。边防军战士脱下自己的军衣，裹起失去母亲、满身血污的孤儿；节省下自己的米和各族人民一起熬稀粥。
    在百丈悬崖上，战士李连兴和一个匪首扭在一起，匪首哀求他释放，并答应给他金条，不然就同归于尽；就在这一刹间，战士决定了自己的生与死，他毅然选择了黄金不换的光荣道路，和匪首一起坠入波涛汹涌的澜沧江。
    通信兵黄贵生在送信的途中，只身扑向正在虐杀一个傣族孩子的三个匪徒，他打死了匪徒们，但他自己也倒在孩子的身边，孩子抱住他不停地哭……
    很多部队都曾经成月战斗在原始森林里，没有光亮，靠朽木的磷光来照路；他们踏过匪徒用竹签布满的草坡；扑向匪徒们点燃的火山；爬进天险石洞。一切困难，人民军队都克服了，战胜了！
    边疆的第二个春天来了，边防军护送着人民政府的马帮，把盐和百货送到边远的村寨；边防军帮助深受灾难的各族人民，在荒芜的土地上插下秧；边防军在山岗上主持着民族与民族的解冤酒会，在酒会上，边防军战士和各族人民同干三杯鸡血酒，一起盟誓：
    “山摇我们不摇，
    地动我们不动！”
    在团结的基础上，边防军帮助各族人民组织起自卫联防武装，各族人民拿起刀、矛、弓、弩，和边防军一起，为肃清国境内的最后一个残敌而战斗。
    边疆第三个春天来了，边防军战士才第一次真切地闻到玉兰花的芬芳，真切地看到山茶花是多种多样。但边防军没有停下来休息，一手提枪，一手提锹，在横断山脉上开辟公路，架设桥梁，建造房屋，兴修水利；教各族人民如何耕耘才能收获得多；如何盖房子才牢，才有阳光；如何养牛羊才养得肥胖；如何教自己的子女读书，识字；如何站岗放哨，经常警惕帝国主义的侵略活动。
    今年的春天来得最早，边防军的营地周围盛开着百花。北方战士种的北方农作物茂盛起来了。春天的山野里响着苗笛、芦笙、四弦琴和二弦琴；秧田里的流水声、歌声、口哨声、百鸟齐鸣和清脆的牛铃声交织着，像是一章演奏不完的交响乐曲，那么调和，那么动听。夜晚，草舍里和森林深处燃着愉快的火光，安静啊！那田棚或水臼傍，姑娘在她情人身边低声唱情歌的声音都能被人听见。人们从没这样舒畅过，把黑夜也当白天来过。各族人民几乎不记得这里曾是荒山，这里曾经成年成月喧嚷着哭声和杀声……
    可是，这样的胜利，并没有使边防军产生丝毫麻痹。在这美好的春天，在每一个普通的夜里，当边防军战士的母亲正在做会见英雄儿女的梦的时候，祖国的一切都甜蜜地熟睡着，那么恬静……而边防军战士却醒着！他们目不转睛地注视着那些发射冷枪的地方，静听着别人不会听到的不平静的响声，战士们的心随着那些奇怪的响声跳动……
    一朵花比一朵花更鲜艳；一个春天比一个春天更美丽。春天，是祖国一年大规模和平建设的开始，也是边防军战士更警惕地捍卫边疆的开始。伟大的祖国在春天里大踏步前进！
