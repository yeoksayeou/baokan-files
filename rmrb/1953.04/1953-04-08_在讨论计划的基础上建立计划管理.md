    Establishing Planned Management Based on Plan Discussion

    Currently, national state-owned enterprises across the country are discussing the 1953 national production plan. In this plan discussion, in addition to fully leveraging the initiative and creativity of the vast workforce to formulate advanced, realistic, and feasible production, technology, and financial plans, it is also necessary to establish and improve internal enterprise planned management based on the plan discussion, and also on the basis of discussing and revising many quotas, in order to ensure balanced production. This is a major task for improving enterprise management and production levels.

    At present, planned management is very weak in the production of many state-owned enterprises. Due to the many shortcomings in this work, the enormous potential of our industrial production cannot be realized, resulting in unbalanced production and even affecting the completion of the national production plan. According to the inspection by the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government, although many factories completed or over-fulfilled the total value of the national production plan in 1952, there were still extremely unbalanced phenomena in production between factories and mines, or within a single factory or mine. For example, looking at the completion of the national plan by each enterprise: according to the survey statistics of 184 factories and mines under these two ministries, 84 factories and mines completed the plan at 110% or more in 1952, and 40 completed the plan below 90%. This means that at least one out of four enterprises did not complete the national plan. As for the monthly completion of the national plan: among the 100 factories and mines under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, only 22 were able to complete the plan on a monthly basis for more than nine months of the year, while as many as 44 were unable to complete the plan on a monthly basis for six months. This means that nearly half of the factories and mines could complete the national plan on a monthly basis for half of the year, and could not complete it for the other half. Looking at the implementation of the national plan for the production of major products: enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry that did not complete the plan for major products accounted for 33%; the main product of the First Ministry of Machine Building, generators, had three enterprises out of eleven that did not complete the product plan; and various cutting machines had thirteen enterprises out of thirty-six that did not complete the product plan. This means that one-third of the factories and mines did not complete the national plan for major products and had to make up for it with secondary products. The execution of plans by each enterprise in each month is also unbalanced, seriously showing large differences, with some differing by as much as twelve times. If we look at the execution of the plan in each ten-day period of a month, it is mostly loose at the beginning and tight at the end, with the output in the first ten days of each month often differing from the output in the last ten days by 20% to 50%, and some differing by as much as 70% to 80%. In short, production in each month and each ten-day period shows a wave-like, fluctuating situation.

    This situation is also reflected in the fact that most factories and mines cannot complete production according to plan at the beginning of the month, and only rush to complete it at the end of the month; they cannot complete the plan in the first one or two months of each quarter, and only rush to complete it in the last month; and they use secondary products to make up for the incomplete major products. The result of this situation is that equipment cannot be repaired on schedule; overtime and rush production are frequent. As a result, equipment is frequently damaged, accidents are frequent; quality fluctuates, the scrap rate increases, finished products are not completed, and semi-finished parts are seriously stockpiled. But on the other hand, this situation also shows that our enterprises still have enormous potential. If each of our enterprises can complete the national plan evenly on a ten-day and monthly basis, then it will definitely create greater wealth for the country.

    According to the inspection by the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the First Ministry of Machine Building, the most important reason for the serious imbalance in the execution of the plan is the lack of planned management within the enterprise. This means that although our enterprises have annual, quarterly, and monthly plans, each enterprise, workshop, work section, and group does not have specific operational plans; or if they do have operational plans, many are formalistic, which makes the daily production activities of all employees very blind. This means that there are still many phenomena in our enterprises where no one is responsible, such as no one being responsible for supervising and inspecting the completion of the daily production plan; no one being responsible for solving technical and quality problems; no one being responsible for managing the timely supply of raw materials; and no one being responsible for the timely inspection of equipment and the lack of spare parts and components, so the normal progress of production cannot be guaranteed.

    In order to overcome this shortcoming, our state-owned enterprises need to improve planned management (such as operational plans, quotas, original records, etc.) in a planned and step-by-step manner, and establish various responsibility systems (such as administrative responsibility system, technical responsibility system, technical supply responsibility system, technical safety responsibility system, production scheduling responsibility system, equipment maintenance responsibility system, etc.). Only by establishing and implementing these planned management tasks can we gradually overcome the serious imbalance in the current production of state-owned enterprises. The main link in establishing and improving internal enterprise planned management is to formulate operational plans and supervise the implementation of operational plans. The operational plan is to concretize the production plan, concretizing it to each workshop (pithead), work section, group, each process and type of work; through it, each workshop, each process, and each section can be organically organized to work together to complete the production plan.

    In order to achieve this goal, according to the current conditions, when formulating an operational plan, we should first study the planning tasks given to the enterprise by the state; second, we should carry out various balancing tasks, such as balancing production and sales according to the requirements of the orderers, balancing raw materials according to production requirements, balancing water, electricity, and transportation, and balancing the finished products, semi-finished products and parts within the enterprise. Third, we should correctly calculate production capacity (to implement a regular maintenance plan), rationally organize the labor force, and estimate the technical operating conditions that have been achieved and various advanced experiences that have emerged, so that the organization of the labor force is adapted to it. Therefore, we must carefully analyze the original records, check the completion of the plan in the previous month, and find the average advanced quota. Finally, based on the above situation, and estimating the various possible changes, the production section is responsible for preparing the production schedule for various products of the entire enterprise, and based on the schedule, compiling the production schedule for various products (including parts) of each workshop and the finished products for each month and year. Each workshop must also mobilize work sections and groups to formulate their own schedule according to this schedule, and then collect them from bottom to top to compile a realistic and feasible advanced operational plan. With this operational plan, it can guide the enterprise's production activities, and thus can greatly overcome the blindness in daily production. But having an operational plan only solves half of the problem. To truly realize the plan, there must be a central organization to supervise its implementation. Therefore, while formulating the operational plan, we must first establish a production scheduling responsibility system. Only by establishing a production scheduling responsibility system can we have a specialized organization to supervise the implementation of the plan by each workshop and each work section each month, supervise the material supply by each department according to the plan, and supervise the mutual connection of each process, workshop, semi-finished product, part, and finished product, so as to discover problems at any time, propose corrective measures, promote the establishment of a responsibility system in each department, achieve a relatively balanced production, and ensure the smooth realization of the national plan.

### 在讨论计划的基础上建立计划管理

    在讨论计划的基础上建立计划管理
    全国国营企业目前正在讨论一九五三年度的国家生产计划。在这次讨论计划中，除了必须充分发挥广大职工的积极性、创造性，制定出先进的现实可行的生产、技术、财务计划以外，还必须在讨论计划的基础上、同时也是在讨论修改许多定额的基础上，建立和健全企业内部的计划管理工作，以保证均衡地进行生产。这是提高企业管理水平和生产水平的一项重大任务。
    目前在很多国营企业的生产中，计划管理工作是十分薄弱的。由于这项工作有很多缺点，就使得我们工业生产中的巨大潜力不能发挥，使得生产不均衡，甚至影响国家生产计划的完成。根据中央人民政府重工业部和第一机械工业部的检查，很多工厂在一九五二年度虽然都完成了或超额完成了国家生产计划的总值，但是在厂矿之间，或者在一个厂一个矿的内部，生产上仍然存在极不均衡的现象。例如，从每个企业完成国家计划的情况来看：根据这两个部的一百八十四个厂矿的调查统计，一九五二年完成计划在百分之一百一十以上的有八十四个厂矿，完成计划在百分之九十以下的有四十个。这就是说，四个企业当中，至少有一个没有完成国家计划。如从按月完成国家计划的情况来看：重工业部的一百个厂矿，一年中九个月以上能按月完成计划的只有二十二个，六个月不能按月完成计划的竟有四十四个。这就是说，将近一半的厂矿，半年能按月完成国家计划，半年不能按月完成国家计划。再从国家主要产品生产计划的执行情况来看：重工业部没有完成主要产品计划的企业占百分之三十三；第一机械工业部的主要产品发电机，在十一个企业中有三个企业没有完成产品计划；各种切削机械，在三十六个企业中，有十三个企业没有完成产品计划。这就是说，有三分之一的厂矿没有完成国家的主要产品计划，只好用次要的产品去弥补。至于各个企业各月计划执行的情况也都是不均衡的，严重地表现了高低悬殊，有的竟相差十二倍。如果从一个月的各旬计划执行的情形来看，也多是前松后紧，每月上旬产量与下旬产量常相差百分之二十到五十，有的竟相差百分之七十到八十。总之，各月各旬的生产都表现了波浪式的忽高忽低的状况。
    这种情况同时还表现在：大多数厂矿都是月初不能按计划完成生产，到了月终才加紧突击；每一季度的头一、二月不能完成计划，最后一个月才加紧突击；主要产品完不成计划，就用次要产品去弥补。这种情况所造成的结果，就是设备不能按期检修；时常加班加点突击生产。因而设备经常损坏，事故频繁；质量波动，废品率增多，成品完不成，半成品部件严重积压。但在另一方面，这种情况也说明了我们企业还存在着巨大的潜力，如果我们各个企业都能逐旬逐月地均衡地完成国家计划，那末它就一定能给国家创造更巨大的财富。
    根据重工业部和第一机械工业部的检查，目前执行计划之所以存在着这样严重的不均衡现象，最主要的原因，就是企业内部缺乏计划管理。这就是说，我们的企业里虽然有年度、季度以及月度计划，但是各企业，各车间，各工段，各小组却没有具体的作业计划；或有了作业计划，却有很多是形式主义的，因而使全体职工在日常的生产活动中，带有很大的盲目性。这就是说，我们企业里还有许多无人负责的现象，如每日生产计划完成的情况怎样，无人负责督促检查；技术上、质量上发生了问题，无人负责解决；原材料不能按时供应，也无人负责管理；设备不能按时检查，缺乏备品和零件也无人负责，因此就不能保证生产的正常进行。
    要想克服这种缺点，我们国营企业内部就需要有计划地、有步骤地改善计划管理（如作业计划、定额、原始记录等），建立各种责任制（如行政的专责制、技术的责任制、技术供应责任制、技术安全责任制、生产调度责任制、设备检修责任制等）。只有建立了和执行了这些计划管理工作，才能逐步克服目前国营企业生产中的严重的不均衡现象。建立和健全企业内部计划管理的主要环节，就是编制作业计划并监督作业计划的执行。作业计划就是把生产计划具体化，把它具体化到各个车间（坑口）、工段、小组、各个工序和工种中去；经过它可以把各个车间、各个工序、以及各个科股有机地组织起来，共同为完成生产计划而努力。
    为了达到这个目的，根据目前的条件，在制订作业计划时，首先应该研究国家所给予本企业的计划任务；其次应进行各种平衡工作。如根据订货者的要求进行产销平衡，根据生产要求进行原材料平衡，水、电、运输平衡和企业内部的成品、半成品部件的平衡等。再次，应正确计算生产能力（要执行定期检修计划），合理地组织劳动力，估计已达到的技术操作条件及各种已出现的先进经验，使劳动力的组织与之相适应。因此，就要周详地分析原始记录，检查上月计划完成的情况，找出平均的先进的定额。最后，根据以上情况，估计到各种可能变化的条件，由生产科负责编制全企业的各种产品的生产进度表，并且根据进度表编出各车间的各种产品（包括部件）及每月每年成品的生产进度表。各车间又要根据这种进度表发动工段和小组制订自己的进度表，然后再自下而上地汇集起来，编成一个现实可行的先进作业计划。有了这个作业计划，它就可以指导企业的生产活动，因而也就可以大大克服日常生产中的盲目性。但有了作业计划，还只是解决了问题的一半，真正要实现计划，还必须有一个中心机构去监督执行。因此，在制订作业计划的同时，必须先把生产调度责任制建立起来，只有建立了生产调度责任制，才有一个专门机构去监督各车间、各工段每月执行计划的情形，监督各个部门按计划进行物资供应，监督各个工序、车间、半成品、部件、成品的互相衔接，以便随时发现问题，提出改正办法，促进各个部门建立责任制，达到比较均衡地进行生产的目的，以保证国家计划的顺利实现。
