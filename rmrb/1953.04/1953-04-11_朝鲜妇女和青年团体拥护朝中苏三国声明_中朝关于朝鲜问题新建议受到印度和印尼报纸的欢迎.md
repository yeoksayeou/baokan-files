Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 10th: Kim Young-soo, Vice-Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, and Kim Heuk-jin, Chairman of the Democratic Youth League, issued statements expressing their firm support for the statement by the governments of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union on the Korean armistice negotiations.

Kim Young-soo said: Our statement on the Korean armistice negotiations has created the possibility of resolving the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Convention in order to end the Korean War, giving new hope and encouragement to peace-loving people. Therefore, as Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out in his statement, this proposal by the Korean and Chinese sides has received warm support and welcome from peace-loving people all over the world. If the United States truly desires a peaceful resolution to the Korean question, it must follow the will of the people who yearn for peace and take action to achieve a Korean armistice.

Kim Heuk-jin said: We fully support and agree with the statements of the governments of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, because these statements put forward various proposals to quickly remove the obstacles to the Korean armistice negotiations and guide the negotiations towards success, and these proposals are fully in line with the wishes of all good people in the world. We believe that while our side continues to sincerely strive for a Korean armistice, if the US side can also show sincerity and a spirit of compromise and make practical efforts to restore peace, then the only unresolved issue in the armistice negotiations—the prisoner of war issue—can certainly be agreed upon.

Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: New Delhi dispatch: Indian public opinion continues to comment on the new Sino-Korean proposals regarding the Korean armistice negotiations.

The "Times of India" commented on the 8th that the new Sino-Korean proposal has "provided a fair basis" for resolving the Korean issue.

The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" believes that the Sino-Korean proposal is extremely important for world peace. The "Pioneer" believes this proposal is practical and reasonable. The "Assam Tribune" warns that the US government should make concessions, and if it considers the Sino-Korean proposal a sign of weakness, it will inevitably lead to great disaster.

Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: TASS, Jakarta, April 9th: Premier and Foreign Minister of the State Administrative Council of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai's statement on the Korean armistice negotiations, has aroused widespread response in Indonesia. Indonesian Foreign Minister Moekarto, in a statement to the press, said that Zhou Enlai's proposal for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue makes it possible to ease the current international tensions.

The "Indonesian Tribune" commented on Zhou Enlai's statement: "The proposal of the People's Republic of China will be welcomed by all those who are fighting for peace. The Korean issue, which has been on the agenda for several years, has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people and the destruction of Korean cities and villages, can finally be resolved."

    朝鲜妇女和青年团体拥护朝中苏三国声明
    中朝关于朝鲜问题新建议受到印度和印尼报纸的欢迎
    【新华社平壤十日电】朝鲜民主妇女同盟副委员长金英秀和民主青年同盟委员长金顼镇发表谈话，表示坚决支持朝、中、苏三国政府关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明。
    金英秀说：我方关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明，已经创造了根据日内瓦公约的精神解决战俘遣返问题以便结束朝鲜战争的可能性，给了爱好和平的人民以新的希望和鼓舞。因此，正像苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫在他的声明中所指出的，朝中方面的这次建议受到全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持和欢迎。如果美国真正愿望和平解决朝鲜问题的话，那么就必须遵照人民渴望和平的意志，采取实现朝鲜停战的行动。
    金顼镇说：我们完全支持和赞同朝、中、苏三国政府的声明，因为这些声明提出了迅速扫除朝鲜停战谈判的障碍并引导谈判走向成功的各项建议，这些建议是完全符合全世界善良人民的愿望的。我们认为，在我方继续真诚地努力实现朝鲜停战的时候，如果美方也能表示诚意和让步的精神，以实际行动来努力恢复和平，那么停战谈判中唯一没有解决的问题——战俘问题是一定可以达成协议的。
    【新华社十日讯】新德里消息：印度舆论继续评论中朝方面关于朝鲜停战谈判的新建议。
    “印度时报”在八日发表评论说：中朝方面的新建议已经为解决朝鲜问题“提供了公平的基础”。
    “甘露市场报”认为中朝方面的建议对世界和平极为重要。“先锋报”认为这个建议是实在合理的。“阿萨姆论坛报”警告说，美国政府应该让步了，如果认为中朝方面的建议是示弱的表示，就必然要招致大祸。
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社雅加达九日讯：中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明，在印度尼西亚引起了广泛的响应。印度尼西亚外交部部长慕加多在向报界发表的一个声明中说，周恩来的和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，使目前国际紧张局面有缓和的可能。
    “印尼论坛报”评论周恩来的声明说：“中华人民共和国的建议将受到所有为和平而斗争的人们的欢迎。几年以来一直在议程上的、使成千成万的人死亡和使朝鲜的城市和乡村遭受破坏的朝鲜问题，最后可以获得解决。”
