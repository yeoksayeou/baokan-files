    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th — Since November 1952, the returned refugees unreasonably expelled by the British colonial authorities in Malaya have been properly resettled by the People's Government. These refugees, due to the exploitation and abuse by British imperialism, were mostly destitute and physically weak when they returned to the country. The Overseas Chinese Affairs organs of the People's Government helped them solve the difficulties of food, clothing, and shelter from the time they arrived in Guangzhou, and the elderly, weak, and sick were treated. Then, according to the wishes of the refugees, they were properly resettled. Since last November, 959 refugees have been sent back to their hometowns, 966 have been placed to work in the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Collective Farm on Hainan Island, the Wanqingsha Overseas Chinese Collective Farm in Dongguan, and the Lufeng Farm, 126 have been sent to work in government offices, factories, and schools, and 54 have been sent to study. In addition, more than one hundred elderly, young, and sick refugees are still receiving proper care in the reception center.
    The refugees who have taken up jobs, started studying, and returned to their hometowns to engage in production are very grateful for the care and attention of the People's Government and frequently write letters to the Overseas Chinese Affairs organs to report on their work and life. After returning to his hometown of Fengshun County, refugee Liu Biao wrote a letter describing how he had been allocated newly built houses and farmland, and expressed his determination to work hard in production to repay the motherland for its care. Refugee Huang Guanqun, whose home is in Hepo District, Jieyang, described in a letter to the Overseas Chinese Affairs organs how he was working hard in agricultural production, saying: "The government sent us cotton clothes and quilts, gave us settlement allowances, and allocated fields and houses to us. How can we live up to the motherland if we don't produce well?"

    人民政府侨务机关
    妥善安置马来亚回国难侨
    【新华社广州十七日电】从一九五二年十一月以来，被马来亚英国殖民当局无理驱逐回国的难侨，都已得到人民政府的妥善安置。这些难侨因遭受英帝国主义的剥削和虐待，在回国时大都一贫如洗，身体羸弱。人民政府的侨务机关从他们到达广州时起，便帮助他们解决衣食住的困难，老弱有病的都得到了治疗。然后根据难侨们的志愿分别给以妥善的安置。计从去年十一月以来，资送回乡的难侨九百五十九人，安置到海南岛兴隆华侨集体农场、东莞万顷沙华侨集体农场和陆丰农场工作的九百六十六人，送往机关、工厂、学校工作的一百二十六人，送往学习的五十四人。此外，有一百多老、幼和患病的难侨仍在招待所受到妥善的照顾。
    走上了工作、学习岗位和回乡生产的难侨，对人民政府的关怀和照顾都非常感激，经常向侨务机关写信报告他们工作和生活的情况。难侨刘标回到家乡丰顺县后，写信叙述他分得了新建的房子和田地，表示要努力生产来报答祖国对他的关怀。家在揭阳河婆区的难侨黄冠群，他在给侨务机关的信上叙述努力参加农业生产的情形说：“政府送给我们棉衣、棉被，发给我们安家费，又分田分屋给我们，不好好生产能对得住祖国吗？”
