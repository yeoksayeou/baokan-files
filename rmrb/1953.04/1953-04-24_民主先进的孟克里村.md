Those who have visited Mengkeli Village in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, have seen the concrete foundation for implementing universal suffrage in the vast rural areas of the new China.

Mengkeli Village is located on the left bank of the Songhua River, a village inhabited by 192 peasant households. The people of the whole village cherish and love the democratic rights that the people's democratic system has brought them. Since the village held its first village people's representative conference in February 1949 and elected the village people's government, the village people's government has been re-elected four times; the village people's representative conference is held on average once a month to discuss and check the work of the government. Last year, because of the heavy workload of implementing the new farming methods of "wide-row equidistant sowing, thinning to protect seedlings, and applying topdressing fertilizer in stages" and fighting drought and flood disasters, the village people's representative conference was held fifteen times in one year. Every year when the village people's representative conference is re-elected, the people of the whole village show a high degree of political enthusiasm and a responsible spirit of being the masters of their own affairs. Before the election, the whole village is divided into six districts, and everyone discusses who has the right to vote and who does not, and then elects people's representatives, and seriously puts forward proposals for matters that should be promoted and reformed in the village and criticisms of government cadres, and submits them to the meeting for discussion. Of the 42 representatives attending the village people's representative conference in 1952, 33 were directly elected by the people. The people put forward more than 70 proposals, which were discussed and dealt with one by one at the meeting.

The people's representative conference system is warmly supported by the people of the whole village. In recent years, the people's representative conference has played a great role in mobilizing the people of the whole village to complete various construction tasks. For example, in the summer of 1951, the floodwaters of the Songhua River rose sharply, and there was a danger of overflowing the embankment. If the river water overflowed the embankment, more than half of the village's farmland would be flooded. At that time, on the suggestion of the village branch of the Chinese Communist Party, the people's representative conference held a meeting to discuss countermeasures to deal with the flood, criticized the thinking of some farmers who only wanted to save their own crops regardless of the overall situation, and passed a resolution to mobilize the people of the whole village to rush to repair the river embankment. The next day, more than 400 men, women, and children in the village carried shovels and baskets to carry out the rescue. Everyone said: For the safety of the whole village, everyone should implement the resolution of the people's representative conference. After twenty consecutive days and nights of emergency repairs by the people of the whole village, the earthwork project of more than seven li of the Yangtze River embankment was finally completed, ensuring the safety of the people and farmland of the whole village.

Through the village people's representative conference, the people of the whole village have enriched their experience in exercising democratic rights, and often check and supervise the work of the village people's government and cadres. When the village people's government was re-elected in the spring of 1951, Tong Ziyang was elected as the deputy village chief because of his active work. After Tong Ziyang was elected, because he only took care of his own production, he gradually became passive in village government work. He was criticized several times at the people's representative conference, but he did not correct himself. So at the village people's representative conference held in September, the representatives proposed to remove him from his post as deputy village chief. After approval by the higher-level people's government, the village people's representative conference re-elected Luan Jingfang, the production committee member who had stayed at his post day and night during the damming work and took the lead in repairing dangerous works, as the deputy village chief.

    民主先进的孟克里村
    新华社记者  高方
    访问过黑龙江省肇源县孟克里村的人们，都具体地看到了在新中国广大农村中实行普选的基础。
    孟克里村在松花江左岸，是一个有一百九十二户农民居住的村庄。全村人民对于人民民主制度给他们带来的民主权利极为珍视和热爱。孟克里村自从一九四九年二月举行村人民代表会议，选举村人民政府以来，到现在为止，村人民政府已经过四次改选；村人民代表会议平均每月召开一次，讨论和检查政府工作。去年因为实行“等距宽播、间苗保苗、分期追肥”的新耕作法和抗御旱涝灾害等工作任务繁忙，一年就召开了十五次村人民代表会议。每年改选村人民代表会议的时候，全村人民都表现了高度的政治积极性和当家做主的负责精神。在选举前，全村划分为六个区，大家讨论谁有选举权、谁没有选举权，然后选出人民代表，并认真提出本村应兴应革事项的议案和对政府干部的批评，交人民代表带到会上讨论。一九五二年出席村人民代表会议的四十二名代表中，就有三十三名是由人民直接选举出来的。人民提出的议案共有七十多件，会上一一进行了讨论和处理。
    人民代表会议制度受到全村人民的热烈拥护。几年来，人民代表会议在动员全村人民完成各项建设任务中起了很大作用。如一九五一年夏季松花江洪水猛涨，眼看有溢堤危险，如果江水出堤，全村半数以上的农田都将被淹。当时，在中共村支部的建议下，人民代表会议开会讨论了应付水患的对策，批判了有些农民不顾大局只想抢救自己庄稼的思想，通过了动员全村人民抢修江堤的决议。第二天，全村男女老少便有四百多人扛着铁锹，挑着土篮，进行抢险。大家说：为了全村的安全，人人都应执行人民代表会议的决议。经过全村人民连续二十天的昼夜抢修，终于把七里多长江堤的培土工程完成，保住了全村人民和农田的安全。
    通过村人民代表会议，全村人民丰富了行使民主权利的经验，对村人民政府的工作和干部经常进行检查和督促。一九五一年春天改选村人民政府时，佟子阳当时因为工作积极被选为副村长。佟子阳当选后，由于他专门照顾自己的生产，慢慢对村政工作消极起来，在人民代表会议上曾经批评过他几次，但并没有改正。于是在九月间召开村人民代表会议时，代表们提议罢免他的副村长职务。经上级人民政府批准后，村人民代表会议补选了在堵堤工作中昼夜坚守工作岗位、带头抢修险工的生产委员栾景芳为副村长。
