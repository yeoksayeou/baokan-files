The problem of work stoppage in the first batch of construction projects in North China has begun to be resolved. The preparatory work for the second batch of projects is also being actively arranged.

Since the North China Construction Engineering Bureau held a meeting in February to discuss solutions to the problem of work stoppage, construction engineering units in various provinces and cities have taken concrete measures to strive for the early commencement of some projects. Currently, the No. 1 Engineering Company directly under North China has started construction on more than 70,000 square meters of projects. The 15,000 square meters of cross-year projects of Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Company were all started before March 15. The Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau has organized a group of design personnel to tackle the design tasks for the first batch of 170,000 square meters, so that these projects can be quickly constructed. Various construction units have also adopted methods of mutual support and rational allocation of labor to solve some of the work stoppage problems. For example, the construction engineering departments of Taiyuan and Yangquan have supplied some workers to the Municipal Construction Engineering Company, allowing these workers to participate in the municipal construction that has already started.

While striving to solve the problem of work stoppage in the first batch of projects, the North China Construction Engineering Bureau has paid attention to the construction of the second batch of projects. To this end, the bureau has instructed construction engineering departments in various provinces and cities to step up preparations for new projects. In order to change the current phenomenon of unclear plans and tasks, construction departments in various provinces and cities will establish a joint office system under the leadership of the Financial and Economic Committee, with the participation of relevant units. The construction engineering bureaus of various provinces and cities will be responsible for convening joint meetings of construction units and contractors to select important and large-scale projects, specifically arrange survey, design, and construction schedules, and adopt the parallel operation method of batch design, batch preparation, and batch construction. In terms of allocation of building materials and labor, various construction units will continue to support and coordinate with each other, so that new projects can be started continuously and the phenomenon of intermittent construction can be avoided.

Tianjin Municipal Financial and Economic Committee and relevant construction departments have taken various emergency measures to basically solve the problem of work stoppage.

These measures are: (1) The Municipal Financial and Economic Committee, Urban Construction Committee, Construction Engineering Bureau and other units organized a basic construction task allocation team to comprehensively register the basic construction tasks of the central and local systems, and actively promoted various departments to quickly prepare basic construction plans, and helped solve the difficulties in preparing the plans, so as to report to the higher authorities for approval as soon as possible, and carry out design and construction as soon as possible; and in the process of carrying out this work, it corrected the idea of ​​some units not paying enough attention to basic construction and relying on waiting. (2) The establishment of a joint office for basic construction land. In the past, the procedures for applying for basic construction land were complicated and involved many issues. Some projects could not be designed for a long time because the land could not be determined. Now, the Municipal Financial and Economic Committee, Urban Construction Committee, Construction Engineering Bureau, Municipal Engineering Bureau, Real Estate Management Bureau and other units have transferred cadres to form a unified office organization, which is specifically responsible for handling the application and registration of basic construction land, reviewing and approving the area, area and route of land use, and handling land allocation procedures. This simplifies some of the levels and procedures. (3) The audit procedures have been simplified, and a joint office system for design audit has been established to shorten the audit time. At the same time, the architectural design company also took the initiative to consult with the engineering unit to solve various obstacles in the design and strive for rapid output of drawings.

In addition, appropriate adjustments have also been made to the project arrangements. Under the principle of ensuring the completion of the central and important project tasks, general projects that are ready for construction in the second quarter are also allowed to start construction first.

Due to the above measures, the first phase of engineering tasks in Tianjin this year has been largely affirmed. The construction engineering bureau has assigned a total of more than 200,000 square meters of the first batch of construction tasks (including cross-year projects) to its affiliated companies, which basically solves the problem of work stoppage.

However, the danger of work stoppage in Tianjin has not been completely eliminated. Among the first phase of engineering tasks of more than 310,000 square meters this year, not many technical designs have been completed so far. At the same time, there are still many problems in terms of land use and material preparation for some projects. If the design of the new project cannot be completed as scheduled, and the various construction preparation work cannot be done in time, a serious work stoppage phenomenon will still occur.

    华北第一批工程的窝工问题开始得到解决
    天津市各建筑部门采取紧急措施后窝工问题基本解决
    华北各省市第一批施工工程的窝工问题，现在已开始得到解决。第二批工程的准备工作，也正在积极布置中。
    从二月间华北建筑工程局召开会议，讨论了解决窝工问题的办法以来，各省市建筑工程单位纷纷采取具体措施，争取一部分工程提早开工。现在，华北直属第一工程公司已有七万多平方公尺的工程陆续开工。山西省建筑工程公司的一万五千平方公尺的跨年度工程，已在三月十五日前全部开工。天津市建筑工程局已组织了一批设计力量，突击第一批十七万平方公尺的设计任务，使这批工程能够迅速施工。各建筑单位并采取互相支援、合理调剂劳动力的办法，来解决一部分窝工问题。如太原市和阳泉市的建筑工程部门，都把一部分工人供给市政建设工程公司，使这些工人能够参加已经开工的市政建设。
    与努力解决第一批工程窝工问题的同时，华北建筑工程局已注意到第二批工程的施工问题。为此该局已指示各省市建筑工程部门加紧进行新工程的准备工作。为了改变目前存在的计划、任务不明确的现象，各省市建筑部门都将在财委领导下，吸收各有关单位参加，建立联合办公制度；各省市的建筑工程局将负责召开建设单位和承建单位的联席会议，选择重要的规模较大的工程，具体安排勘测、设计、施工日程，采用分批设计、分批准备、分批施工的平行作业法。在建筑材料和劳动力的调配方面，各建筑单位将继续互相支援，互相调剂，以便使新工程不间断地开工，避免在施工中发生忽断忽紧的现象。（新华社）
    天津市财政经济委员会和各有关建筑部门采取各种紧急措施，基本上解决了窝工问题。
    这些措施是：（一）由市财经委员会、城市建设委员会、建筑工程局等单位组织基本建设任务分配小组，全面登记中央与地方各个系统的基本建设任务，主动推动各部门迅速编制基本建设计划，并帮助解决编制计划中的困难，以便及早报请上级批准，早日进行设计和施工；并且在进行这一工作的过程中纠正了某些单位对基本建设不够重视和依赖等待的思想。（二）成立基本建设用地联合办公室。过去申请基本建设用地时，手续繁杂，涉及问题很多，有些工程往往由于用地不能肯定，长期不能进行设计。现在由市财经委员会、城市建设委员会、建筑工程局、市政工程局、房地产管理局等单位抽调干部，组成了一个统一的办公机构，专门负责办理基本建设用地的申请登记，审查与核准使用土地的区域，面积与路线，办理土地拨付手续等工作。这样就简化了一些办事层次和手续。（三）简化审核程序，建立设计审核联合办公制度，缩短了审核时间。同时建筑设计公司也主动与工程单位协商，解决设计中各种障碍，争取迅速出图。
    此外，在工程安排上也作了适当的调整，在保证完成中央的和重要的工程任务的原则下，凡在第二季度已具备施工条件的一般工程，也准予先开工。
    由于采取了上述措施，今年天津市第一期工程任务已大体肯定，建筑工程局分配给所属各公司的首批施工任务（连跨年度工程在内）共二十多万平方公尺，基本上解决了窝工问题。
    但是，天津市窝工的危险并没有完全消除。今年第一期三十一万多平方公尺的工程任务中，至今完成了技术设计的还不多。同时，有些工程在用地，材料准备等方面还存在着不少问题。如果新工程设计不能如期完成，各种施工准备工作不能及时做好，仍会发生严重的窝工现象。（王强）
