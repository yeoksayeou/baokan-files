    The Marriage Law Implementation Campaign in Hebei Province is Entering Completion
    The Marriage Law Has Taken Root in People's Hearts, and Social Customs Have Undergone Significant Changes
    The Provincial Party Committee Instructs All Localities to Make Plans for Regularly Implementing the Marriage Law
    The propaganda and implementation campaign of the Marriage Law in Hebei Province has entered, or is about to enter, the stage of commending role models, focusing on holding family meetings to establish family conventions, consolidating achievements, and preparing for completion in most areas. In the eight special districts of Cangxian, Tongxian, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Handan, Baoding, and Tangshan, the propaganda and implementation campaign of the Marriage Law has ended in one hundred and ninety key village areas and two thousand five hundred and sixty-four villages (streets), as well as in the four cities of Qinhuangdao, Xuanhua, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang. The entire province is expected to conclude the campaign by April 10th, transitioning to the regular implementation of the Marriage Law. Only a few villages in fifteen counties within the Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan special districts will be slightly delayed.

    The Marriage Law propaganda and implementation campaign in Hebei Province began in early March. Over one million people, including ninety thousand trained grassroots cadres, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, Party reporters, and propagandists, were mobilized to widely carry out propaganda activities village by village and street by street. Because grassroots cadres, Party members, and League members established three basic viewpoints—gender equality, freedom of marriage, and democratic and harmonious family unity for production—through "digging roots" and "accounting" methods during collective training and general training, ideologically drawing a clear line between the new and old marriage systems, and recognizing the importance of implementing the Marriage Law, the vast majority actively propagated the law, supported the struggle for freedom of marriage, took the initiative to persuade backward parents, and were able to use "digging roots" and "accounting" methods to ensure that the propaganda of the Marriage Law deeply resonated with the people, according to various different situations. Currently, the general public has received three to five times of propaganda education (some more than ten times), basically achieving household knowledge and deeply rooted understanding. According to the "screening" results of a check conducted in three villages on the outskirts of Baoding City, everyone said that the new marriage system is good and the old marriage system kills people. In villages (streets) that have reached the climax of the campaign, young people can openly date without being ridiculed or interfered with. Many older people, who were previously considered to be a resistance to the movement, have become active supporters of the Marriage Law. Facts from various places prove that older people care about the happiness of their children and the harmony of their families. They also have the deepest experience of the pain of old marriages. Once the truth is explained to them, the pros and cons are clarified, and their concerns about so-called "ruining family traditions" and "not being able to control daughters-in-law" are dispelled, they can all agree to let their children find their own partners and no longer interfere. Several older people in Nanlingshan Village, Mancheng County, began sending their daughters to school so that they could have autonomy over their marriages in the future, saying, "I won't interfere with your affairs." Even the most narrow-minded people acknowledge that free marriage is now legal, and the old marriage system is no longer legal. They all expressed that "the trend has arrived, just follow it." In short, social customs have greatly changed. It has become a common phenomenon to actively resolve issues such as marital disharmony, gender inequality, and family disunity in accordance with the provisions of the Marriage Law. In Zhangjiakou City, a total of seven hundred and forty issues were raised during the campaign, of which ninety-six percent were raised by the masses themselves after receiving education on the Marriage Law, and three hundred and thirty-five were resolved by the masses themselves. Many long-suffering families created by the old feudal marriage system have now become happy families characterized by democracy, harmony, unity, and production.

    In order to solve the problem of integrating the Marriage Law with production, various places have propagandized to cadres and the masses the rationale that implementing the Marriage Law is beneficial to production and construction. County and district cadres who went deep into the villages implemented the method of "organizing together," forming working groups to uniformly lead the production and Marriage Law implementation campaign. Village cadres implemented specific divisions of labor in conjunction with production. For example, the Mancheng County Party Committee adopted the method of focusing on key areas to promote general progress, overcoming the shortcomings of grassroots leaders being accustomed to working alone. Village cadres also divided their focus to lead different tasks such as production and Marriage Law implementation, so that all tasks achieved results at the same time.

    During the Marriage Law propaganda and implementation campaign in Hebei Province, the leading organs in some areas wanted to end the campaign hastily due to the arrival of the spring plowing season. Some areas that started later wanted to end at the same time as the advanced areas after only conducting the campaign superficially. For example, Rongcheng County in Baoding Special District only worked for seven days, and Gu'an County only worked for ten days before ending. Zunhua County in Tangshan Special District ended on its own without commending role models in twenty-five villages. Feixiang, Cheng'an, Yongnian and other counties in Handan Special District withdrew a large number of working group cadres without completing the ending work. Xingtai, Julu and other counties in Xingtai Special District reduced the number of key villages and abandoned the work of leading the surrounding villages. The above-mentioned phenomena have been promptly corrected. In order to ensure that the province's Marriage Law propaganda and implementation campaign effectively achieves the expected results, comes to a satisfactory conclusion, and lays the foundation for the regular implementation of the Marriage Law in the future, so as to prevent a hasty conclusion, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed all localities to pay attention to the following points in the concluding stage: (1) Conduct a careful inspection. Key areas must meet the prescribed standards. If they have not been reached, continue to do a good job in conjunction with production; general villages should conduct an inspection in conjunction with current production and make plans for the regular implementation of the Marriage Law; in a few "blank spot" villages that have not undergone general training, where the masses and cadres are ideologically confused, affecting the mood for production, a village cadre meeting should be convened to explain the policies and help them make plans for the regular implementation of the Marriage Law. (2) Do a good job of ending the work in the villages. The main tasks are: to hold small-scale mass symposiums for summarizing and further educating the masses to act in accordance with the Marriage Law; to hold meetings of Party members and propagandists to commend model Party members and model propagandists in the Marriage Law implementation campaign, and to make plans for the regular propaganda of the Marriage Law; Party branches, village people's governments, the Communist Youth League, and women's federations should designate special personnel to regularly carry out the work of implementing the Marriage Law and resolving issues related to the Marriage Law; rectify and improve the organization of women's representative conferences, propaganda networks, and mediation committees, and regularly implement the Marriage Law through these organizations. (3) Party committees at all levels must do a good job of summarizing and making plans for the regular implementation of the Marriage Law. Conclude one village, summarize one village, conclude one area, summarize one area, conclude one district and one county, summarize one district and one county. The plan should be realistic and avoid formalism. Some cadres who directly control the movement in key villages, districts, and counties can be convened to discuss and study. (Liu Dachang)

    河北省贯彻婚姻法运动即将结束
    婚姻法深入人心社会风气发生了显著变化
    省委指示各地作好经常贯彻婚姻法的计划
    河北省宣传贯彻婚姻法运动在大部地区已经进入或即将进入表扬模范、重点开家庭会订立家庭公约、巩固成果、准备结束的阶段。沧县、通县、张家口、石家庄、天津、邯郸、保定、唐山八个专区的一百九十个重点片村和二千五百六十四个村（街）和秦皇岛、宣化、保定、石家庄四市宣传贯彻婚姻法运动已经结束。全省预计在四月十日前全部结束，转入经常贯彻婚姻法的工作。只有邢台、石家庄、唐山三个专区的十五个县的少数村庄将稍为推迟。
    河北省宣传贯彻婚姻法运动自三月上旬开始，经过训练的九十万基层干部、共产党员、青年团员以及党的报告员、宣传员等一百多万人的宣传大军，一齐出动，分村（街）分片广泛展开宣传活动。由于在集训和普训中，基层干部、党员、团员用“挖根”“算账”的办法树立了男女平等、婚姻自由、家庭民主和睦团结生产等三个基本观点，从思想上划清了新旧婚姻制度的界限，认清了贯彻婚姻法的重要性，因此绝大部分都积极地宣传，支持争取婚姻自由的斗争，主动地说服落后的家长，并且能够针对各种不同的情况，运用“挖根”“算账”的方法，使婚姻法的宣传深入人心。目前一般人民群众都已受到三次至五次的宣传教育（多的达到十次以上），基本上做到了家喻户晓，深入人心。据保定市在市郊三个村庄进行检查“摸底”的结果，所有的人都说新婚姻制度好，旧婚姻制度害死人。凡是达到运动高潮的村（街），青年们都已能公开恋爱，不再遭受嘲骂和干涉。过去一般认为是运动阻力的老年人，有许多变成了贯彻婚姻法的积极分子。各地事实证明，老年人都是关心自己儿女的幸福和关心家庭和睦的，他们对旧婚姻的痛苦也体验最深，一旦对他们讲明了道理、使他们弄清了利害，解除了他们最担心的所谓“败坏门风”和“管不了闺女媳妇”的顾虑，他们就都能够同意自己的儿女自己找对象，不再干涉。满城县南陵山村有好几个老年人开始送女儿上学，将来让她们婚姻自主，并说：“你们的事儿我可不管了。”思想最不开通的人，也承认自由结婚已经是合法的，旧婚姻制度已经不合法了。都表示“潮流到了，随着走就好”。总之，社会风气已大大改变。按照婚姻法的规定去主动地解决夫妻不和睦、男女不平等、家庭不团结等问题的，已成普遍现象。张家口市在运动中共提出七百四十件问题，其中有百分之九十六是群众受过婚姻法宣传教育后自动提出的，由群众自己解决了的就有三百三十五件。旧的封建的婚姻制度造成的许多长期痛苦的家庭，现在变成了民主和睦团结生产的幸福家庭。
    各地为解决结合生产贯彻婚姻法的问题，曾对干部群众宣传了贯彻婚姻法有利生产建设的道理。深入到村的县区干部实行“组织起来”的办法，组成工作组统一领导生产与贯彻婚姻法运动。村干部则结合生产实行具体的分工。如满城县委采取分工深入重点推动一般的方法，克服基层领导上惯于单打一的缺点，村干部也各分重点领导生产、贯彻婚姻法等不同工作，使各项工作在同一时期都获得了成绩。
    河北省宣传贯彻婚姻法运动中，有些地区的领导机关曾因春耕季节到来而想潦草结束运动。有些开展较迟的地区，只潦草地进行了一下就要和先进地区同时结束。如保定专区的容城县只搞了七天、固安县只搞了十天就结束；唐山专区遵化县二十五个村没有表扬模范就自行结束；邯郸专区的肥乡、成安、永年等县未作结束工作，即把工作组干部大批抽回；邢台专区的邢台、钜鹿等县缩减重点村数目，并放弃带动周围村。上述现象已经及时纠正。为了使全省的宣传贯彻婚姻法运动切实达到预期的效果，圆满结束，奠定今后经常贯彻婚姻法的基础，防止草率结束，中共河北省委会已指示各地在结束阶段必须注意以下几点：（一）认真检查。重点片村一定要达到规定的标准。没有作到的，要结合生产继续作好；一般村要结合当前生产进行一次检查，作好经常贯彻婚姻法的计划；少数未经普训的“白点”村，群众和干部思想混乱，影响生产情绪的，要召集一次村干部会议，讲明政策，帮助他们订好经常贯彻婚姻法的计划。（二）作好村的结束工作。主要是：开小型群众座谈会进行总结，进一步教育群众按婚姻法办事；开党员、宣传员大会，表扬宣传婚姻法运动中的模范党员、模范宣传员，作出经常宣传婚姻法的计划；党支部、村人民政府、青年团、妇联等组织要确定专人经常做贯彻婚姻法工作和解决有关婚姻法的问题；整顿和健全妇女代表会、宣传网、调解委员会的组织，通过这些组织经常贯彻婚姻法。（三）各级党委必须作好总结工作和经常贯彻婚姻法的计划。结束一村，总结一村，结束一片，总结一片，结束一区一县，总结一区一县。作计划要实事求是，切忌形式主义，可召集一些重点村、区、县直接掌握运动的干部讨论研究。（刘大昌）
