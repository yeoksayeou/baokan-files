Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th. The United States Department of Defense is racking its brains over how to deal with repatriated American prisoners of war, now that the agreement on the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war has just been signed. The so-called "fact report" published by the U.S. Department of Defense on April 12 shows that it is trying every means to prevent repatriated American prisoners of war from revealing the lenient treatment they received in the Korean-Chinese prisoner of war camps.

According to the U.S. Department of Defense, this eight-page "fact report" was made after reviewing more than 29,000 letters from American prisoners of war to their families. The report admits that American prisoners of war told their relatives in all these letters that the treatment they received in the Korean-Chinese prisoner of war camps was "benevolent and generous," and that the food and clothing they received were very good. However, all these humanitarian and lenient treatments of American prisoners of war by the Korean-Chinese side in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention were described by the U.S. Department of Defense as a kind of "pressure." The report fabricated some so-called "captured documents," "orders," and "discussion topics," trying to vaguely prove that the facts reported in the American prisoners of war's letters were all so-called "Communist propaganda." But even the Associated Press believes that this report "did not provide detailed explanations" for the methods of so-called "misleading the minds of American soldiers."

The U.S. Department of Defense wants to use such a report to eliminate the influence of American prisoners of war's letters on the American people and to prepare for the persecution of repatriated American sick and wounded prisoners of war, forbidding them to disclose the truth about everything that happened in Korea. In fact, the U.S. Department of Defense has made more preparations in this regard. One day before the release of this report, the United Press International reported from Washington that the U.S. Army authorities had prepared a so-called "rehabilitation" plan for the repatriated American prisoners of war, to "restore them politically and psychologically to their original American way of life." This so-called "rehabilitation" plan includes so-called "educational speeches" and "good-looking things on American streets," to make American prisoners of war afraid to mention the good treatment they received in the Korean-Chinese prisoner of war camps, and their new views on all American actions in Korea, and if possible, to fabricate some slander and libel against the Korean-Chinese side in their name, as propaganda capital.

The U.S. Army authorities made the steps they prepared to persecute the American returnees very clear. They "anticipate that after 120 American sick and wounded prisoners of war are released by the Communists, probably only 12 of them will be in a normal state and willing to tell about their situation during their captivity." And this so-called "normal state" prisoner of war, according to American news agencies, will be selected through complicated procedures. After being examined by doctors, this kind of prisoner of war will also be "interviewed by officers in charge of censorship." Only after this kind of "censorship" will they be allowed to report to reporters about the "situation during their captivity." And during the reporter's visit, the reporters will be divided into four or more groups, and each group can only be represented by one reporter to ask questions. The duration of the interview is limited to only a few minutes. The U.S. Army authorities apparently feel that this is not enough to ensure safety. Therefore, according to the British "Observer" weekly, the repatriated prisoners of war "will be required to sign a form, making them responsible for official confidentiality measures." This is to be responsible for the confidentiality measures of their germ warfare. The U.S. Army authorities believe that only after this can American prisoners of war become people who are "in a normal state" that meets its requirements.

However, what if, after the so-called "rehabilitation," these American prisoners of war are still unwilling to forget the humanitarian, generous, and benevolent treatment they received in the Korean-Chinese prisoner of war camps, and are still unwilling to give up their views on things that they can retain according to their personal rights? The solution has long been thought of, and the United Press International has already revealed it, that is: "The Federal Bureau of Investigation is responsible for investigating the activities of prisoners of war who still accept Communist philosophy after their discharge."

    美国防部周密布置迫害被遣返的病伤美俘
    不许他们透露在朝中战俘营中所受到的宽大待遇
    【新华社开城十六日电】交换病伤被俘人员的协定刚刚签订，美国国防部就在为了如何对付被遣返的美国战俘而大伤脑筋了。美国国防部在四月十二日发表的所谓“事实报告”，表明它正在想方设法，不让被遣返的美国战俘透露他们在朝中战俘营中所受到的宽大待遇。
    据美国国防部说，这份长达八页的“事实报告”是在审查了二万九千多封美国战俘的家信以后作出来的。这个报告承认，美国战俘在所有这些信中全都告诉他们的亲人说，他们在朝中战俘营中受到的待遇是“仁慈而宽大的”，他们所得到的食物和衣服是很好的。可是，朝中方面按照日内瓦公约原则对美国战俘的所有这些人道主义的宽大待遇，却被美国国防部说成是一种“压力”。这个报告捏造了一些所谓“缴获的文件”、“命令”、“讨论题目”，想含含糊糊地证明美国战俘的家信中所报告的事实都是所谓“共产党宣传”。但是连美联社也认为，这个报告对于所谓“使美国士兵的思想误入歧途”的方法，“并没有作详细说明”。
    美国国防部想用这样一份报告，来消除美国战俘的家信在美国人民中所引起的影响，并且为迫害被遣返的美国伤病战俘、不许他们透露在朝鲜发生的一切事情的真相作好准备。事实上，美国国防部在这方面所作的准备，还不止此。在这个报告发表以前一天，合众社就从华盛顿报道说，美国陆军当局对于被遣返的美国战俘已经准备好了一个所谓“改造”计划，要“使他们在政治上和心理上能恢复原来的美国生活方式”。这个所谓“改造”计划，包括所谓“教育演讲”和“美国大街上好看的东西”在内，要使美国战俘不敢提到他们在朝中战俘营里所受到的良好待遇，和他们对于美国在朝鲜的一切作为的新的看法，如果可能的话，再要他们或者以他们的名义，捏造一些污蔑和诽谤朝中方面的话，当作宣传的资本。
    美国陆军当局把他们准备迫害美方归俘的步骤说得很明白。他们“预料一百二十个美国的病伤战俘被共军放出来以后，大概只会有十二个人处于正常状态，愿意告诉他们被俘期间的情况。”而这种所谓“处于正常状态”的战俘，据美国通讯社报道说，将是经过复杂的手续挑选出来的。这种战俘在经过医生检验以后，还要经过“负责审查的军官谈话”。只有经过这种“审查”以后，才让他们来向记者报告“被俘期间的情况”。而在记者访问的时候，记者将分成四个或四个以上的小组，每组只能由一个记者代表发问。访问的时间又限定只能有几分钟。美国陆军当局显然觉得这样还不能保险，因此，据英国“观察家”周报报道说，被遣返的战俘“将被要求在一种表格上签字，使他们对官方的保密措施负责”这就是要对他们的细菌战保密措施负责。美国陆军当局认为，只有这样以后，美国战俘才有可能成为符合于它的要求的“处于正常状态”的人。
    可是，经过了所谓“改造”，这些美国战俘们仍然不愿意忘掉他们在朝中战俘营中所受到的人道主义的宽大而仁慈的待遇，仍然不愿意放弃根据他们的个人权利可以保有的对于事物的看法，那又怎么办呢？办法早就想好了，合众社已经透露出来了，这就是：“联邦调查局对于退伍后仍然接受共产主义哲学的战俘，负有调查他们活动的责任。”
