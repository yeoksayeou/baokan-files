    “Strive for People's Democracy, Strive for Lasting Peace!” Publishes Special Article Pointing Out That Laboring People in Capitalist Countries Are Becoming Increasingly Impoverished

    On April 3rd, "Strive for People's Democracy, Strive for Lasting Peace!" published an article entitled "Figures and Facts." The article wrote: While the masses of the people are becoming increasingly impoverished, monopoly capitalists are growing fatter and fatter. According to U.S.-published figures, which are obviously underestimated, the total profits earned by U.S. companies during the two and a half years of the Korean War (up to the end of 1952) were equal to the profits earned during the five years of World War II. During the same period, workers' income, even according to figures published by the Department of Commerce, was only 70 percent of the officially estimated minimum living expenses, and in reality, it was even less than 60 percent.

    The ruling groups of capitalist countries impose most of the burden of the arms expansion and war preparation movement on the working people. Compared with the pre-war fiscal year of 1937-1938, this year's U.S. budget has increased the direct taxes of the American people twelvefold. The British budget for this year stipulates that taxes will increase by nearly 18 percent compared to the 1950-1951 fiscal year. In France, direct taxes in the first eight months of 1952 increased by 21 percent compared to the same period in 1951. In Italy and Greece, taxes rose by 10 percent in 1952 alone.

    From 1937 to 1951, the proportion of taxes in workers' wages in the United States rose from 12 percent to 41 percent, and in the United Kingdom from 29 percent to 53 percent. In 1946-1947, the taxes paid by the working people in West Germany accounted for 51.3 percent of the total tax revenue, rising to 82.6 percent in 1951.

    In all capitalist countries, the prices of essential goods for people's livelihood continue to rise. In 1952, the retail price of bread in the United States rose by 28 percent compared to 1947, and meat rose by 26 percent; in the United Kingdom, bread rose by 90 percent, and meat rose by 35 percent; in France, bread more than doubled, and meat rose by 88 percent. In the one year from September 1951 to September 1952, the prices of civilian consumer goods in France rose by 15 percent, and in Italy by nearly 11 percent.

    According to official figures, which are obviously understated, the cost of living in the United States rose by 12 percent, in the United Kingdom by 23 percent, and in France by 34 percent during the two and a half years of the Korean War. According to calculations by the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, the cost of living in the United States at the end of 1952 had risen not by 12 percent but by 25 percent compared to 1950. Real wages in 1952 in France and Italy were less than half of what they were before the war; in the United Kingdom, real wages were 20 percent lower than before the war.

    The increase in the absolute and relative impoverishment of the working people in capitalist countries has led to a sharp reduction in food consumption and purchases of furniture and clothing. According to statistics from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the consumption of textiles and clothing in the first quarter of 1952 compared with the first quarter of 1949 fell by 13 percent in France and Denmark, 22 percent in Belgium, 23 percent in Sweden, 26 percent in the United Kingdom, 27 percent in the Netherlands, and 37 percent in Austria. From 1949 to 1951, meat consumption in France fell by 24 percent, and vegetables and fruits fell by 27-28 percent. In the United States, the average per capita consumption of butter in 1951 was 41 percent lower than before the war, and lamb consumption was 56 percent lower.

    The number of unemployed has greatly increased. According to the "Survey of the Economic Situation in Post-War Europe" compiled by the Secretariat of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the number of fully unemployed people in Western European capitalist countries in 1952 reached five million. The actual number of unemployed is currently even higher. At present, the number of fully unemployed and partially unemployed people in the United States exceeds 13 million, in Italy exceeds 4 million, and in West Germany is nearly 3 million.

    As a result of imperialist plunder and cruel exploitation, the economic situation in the Middle East, Near East, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America is rapidly deteriorating. The people of these countries, who account for nearly three-quarters of the population of the capitalist world, live a miserable life. Tens of millions of people are in a state of chronic hunger, and large numbers of people are dying of starvation. (Xinhua News Agency)

### “争取人民民主，争取持久和平！”刊载专文指出  资本主义国家劳动人民越来越穷困

    “争取人民民主，争取持久和平！”刊载专文指出
    资本主义国家劳动人民越来越穷困
    四月三日“争取人民民主，争取持久和平！”发表题为“数字与事实”的文章。文章写道：当人民群众越来越穷困时，垄断资本家却长得越来越肥了。根据美国公布的显然低估了的数字，美国的公司在朝鲜战争的两年半期间（到一九五二年底）所获利润，总数等于第二次大战五年时间所赚利润。同一时期内，职工的收入，即使根据商务部公布的数字，只不过官方估定的最低生活费的百分之七十，实际上甚至不够百分之六十。
    资本主义国家的统治集团把扩军备战运动的大部负担强加在劳动人民的身上。与战前一九三七—一九三八财政年度比较，美国本年度的预算使美国人民的直接税增加了十二倍。英国本年度预算规定捐税比一九五零—一九五一年度增加将近百分之十八。在法国，一九五二年头八个月直接税比一九五一年同时期增加了百分之二十一。在意大利和希腊仅在一九五二年一年内捐税即上升了百分之十。
    从一九三七年到一九五一年这一期间，在职工的薪资中，捐税所占的比重在美国从百分之十二上升到百分之四十一，在英国从百分之二十九上升到百分之五十三。在一九四六—一九四七年，西德劳动人民缴纳的捐税占总税收的百分之五十一点三，到一九五一年上升到百分之八十二点六。
    在所有资本主义国家中，民生必需品的价格不断上涨。一九五二年，美国零售面包价格比一九四七年涨了百分之二十八，肉类涨了百分之二十六；在英国，面包涨了百分之九十，肉类涨了百分之三十五；在法国，面包涨了一倍以上，肉类涨了百分之八十八。从一九五一年九月到一九五二年九月的一年中，民用消费品的价格在法国上涨了百分之十五，在意大利上涨了几近百分之十一。
    根据官方显然缩小的数字，在两年半的朝鲜战争时期中，生活费在美国上升了百分之十二，在英国上升百分之二十三，在法国上升百分之三十四。按美国联合电气工人工会的计算，一九五二年终美国生活费比一九五○年不是上升了百分之十二而是百分之二十五。一九五二年的实际工资在法国和意大利都比战前的一半还要少些；在英国，实际工资比战前减少了百分之二十。
    资本主义国家劳动人民绝对与相对贫困化的增长，引起了食品消费量和家具及衣着购置量的急剧减少。根据联合国欧洲经济委员会的统计，一九五二年第一季纺织品和衣着的消费量与一九四九年第一季比较，在法国和丹麦下降了百分之十三，在比利时下降百分之二十二，在瑞典下降百分之二十三，在英国下降百分之二十六，在荷兰下降百分之二十七，在奥地利下降百分之三十七。从一九四九年到一九五一年，法国肉类消费量下降了百分之二十四，菜蔬和水果下降了百分之二十七—二十八。在美国，一九五一年时每人平均牛油消费量比战前减少百分之四十一，羊肉消费量减少百分之五十六。
    失业的人数大大增加了。据联合国欧洲经济委员会秘书处编制的“战后欧洲经济情况综览”统计，一九五二年西欧资本主义国家完全失业的人数已达五百万。目前实际失业人数还不止此数。现在，完全失业和部分失业的人数，在美国超过了一千三百万，在意大利超过四百万，在西德将近三百万。
    由于帝国主义掠夺和残酷剥削的结果，中近东、非洲、东南亚、拉丁美洲各国的经济情况迅速恶化，占资本主义世界人口近四分之三的这些国家人民过着悲惨的生活。成千万人处在慢性的饥饿中，大批的人因饥饿而死亡。（新华社）
