Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 18th: From the 11th to the 15th, our army continued to inflict casualties on the enemy in battles on the Eastern Front, and began to strike the accomplice British Commonwealth Division, which had recently returned to the front on the Western Front.

	On the Eastern Front, there were only brief battles near the rock caves northwest of Mundung-ri. After suffering more than 2,000 casualties, the Li Pseudo Army's 3rd Division no longer dared to invade rashly. However, a major battle took place on a section of the front near the east coast. On the morning of the 11th, the Li Pseudo Army's 15th Division attacked two adjacent positions of our army south of Gao Cheng with a battalion of troops. However, the attacks were repelled by our defending troops, and more than 200 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. At about 10:00 PM on the same day, more than 300 enemy soldiers, with the coordination of enemy naval artillery fire and four fighter planes, launched another attack on our army, but were met with fierce bombardment by our artillery fire. By 11:00 PM, the enemy was finally repelled.

	In other areas of the Eastern Front, our army carried out four ambush operations in the five days from the 11th to the 15th, eliminating more than 120 enemy soldiers.

	On the Western Front, in an ambush operation near Loudai, north of Gaolangpu-ri, on the night of the 13th, a unit of our army completely annihilated a platoon of the British Commonwealth Division, which had recently been transferred to the front line, and captured one light machine gun, three submachine guns, and one walkie-talkie.

	In the five days from the 11th to the 15th, our army's frontline mobile artillery fire killed or wounded a total of 519 enemy soldiers; frontline anti-aircraft fire shot down 5 enemy planes and damaged 24 enemy planes.

    我军在东线战斗中继续杀伤敌军
    前线高射炮火在五天中击落击伤敌机二十九架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】十一日到十五日五天中，我军继续在东线的战斗中杀伤敌军，并在西线开始打击最近返回前线的帮凶军英联邦师。
    在东线，文登里西北边岩洞附近某高地上只有时间短促的战斗。李伪军第三师在遭受了两千多名伤亡后，已经不敢贸然进犯。然而在靠近东海岸的一段战线上，却发生了一次较大的战斗。十一日早晨，李伪军第十五师以一个营的兵力进攻高城以南我军的两个相邻的阵地。但几次攻击，都被我守军击退，敌军死伤了二百多人。当日下午十时许，三百多名敌军在敌舰炮火和四架战斗机的配合下，再度向我发起攻击，但却遭到了我军炮火的猛烈轰击。到十一时，敌人即被最后击退。
    在东线另外的一些地方，我军在十一日到十五日的五天中进行了四次袭击战，共歼灭敌人一百二十多名。
    在西线，十三日夜里我军某部在高浪浦里以北楼岱附近的一次伏击战中，将最近又被调上阵地的英联邦师的一个班全部歼灭，并缴获轻机枪一挺，冲锋枪三枝，步行机一部。
    十一日到十五日的五天中，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军五百一十九名；前线高射炮火共击落敌机五架，击伤敌机二十四架。
