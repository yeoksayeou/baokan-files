Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 5th: The United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on the UN personnel policy issue on April 1st.

The discussion on this issue began on March 10th when Trygve Lie, who illegally held the position of UN Secretary-General, presented his report on UN personnel policy at the plenary meeting. This man, who faithfully executed the orders of the US State Department, tried his best in his report to justify the US government's illegal interference in the affairs of the UN Secretariat. Lie admitted that he had repeatedly consulted with the US government on the issue of UN Secretariat staff. He also admitted that he had helped the US Federal Bureau of Investigation openly conduct investigations into the "loyalty" of UN staff. After Lie's report, the plenary meeting adjourned.

On March 28th, the plenary meeting resumed its discussion of this issue. US Representative Lodge spoke in support of Lie's report. He also tried his best to justify the US government's "loyalty investigations" of UN staff. On behalf of the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, he put forward a proposal requesting UN member states to assist the Secretary-General in fulfilling his duties.

During the discussion, representatives of Belarus and Poland spoke at the meeting, condemning Lie's blatant violation of the UN Charter and demanding that such actions be stopped. The Belorussian representative pointed out that, according to the UN Charter, the Secretary-General must not seek or receive instructions from any government or other authority in the performance of his duties, but Lie acted on the instructions of the United States. Lie's arbitrary dismissal of UN staff and his illegal actions in assisting the US government to conduct "loyalty investigations" of UN staff have created an abnormal situation in the UN Secretariat and damaged the credibility of the United Nations. Lie's actions have aroused the righteous indignation of world public opinion.

Many representatives from Asian and Arab countries also spoke at the meeting, condemning Lie's illegal actions. Twelve Asian and Arab countries put forward a proposal stipulating that a committee composed of fifteen countries should review Lie's report and submit a report to the Eighth Session of the UN General Assembly. The proposal emphasized that the UN's personnel policy must comply with the purposes and provisions of the UN Charter.

The Indian representative said in his speech that the principles followed by Lie were not in conformity with the principles of the United Nations, an international organization, and that Lie's dismissal of UN staff who refused to undergo US loyalty investigations was a violation of human rights. The Syrian representative said that no government has the right to give the Secretary-General any instructions on the issue of UN staff. However, Lie flagrantly violated this principle and accepted instructions from the US government. The Indonesian representative said: Most countries' delegations and world opinion are shocked by the unhealthy atmosphere pervading the UN Secretariat, and this situation was created by Lie. The Indonesian delegation condemned Lie's actions in allowing the US authorities to force American staff to fill out questionnaires and fingerprint in the UN Secretariat, which must be considered unacceptable. The Iraqi representative also emphasized that Lie's actions were "intolerable and truly disgusting."

Representatives from Latin American countries such as Ecuador, Mexico, and Chile also spoke out against Lie's actions. The Chilean representative said that Lie's personnel policies had damaged the reputation of the United Nations.

Representatives from the Netherlands and Australia also criticized Lie's report.

Even the representatives of France and Britain, who jointly proposed the proposal with the United States, expressed dissatisfaction with Lie's actions in their speeches. The French representative said that Lie had violated the provisions of the UN Charter. The government of any country has no right to interfere in the affairs of UN agencies within its territory, especially not to conduct investigations in UN office premises. The British representative also disagreed with Lie's activities that violated the rights enjoyed by the UN headquarters.

The plenary meeting on April 1st voted on the proposals. The United States, manipulating the majority, vetoed the proposal put forward by twelve Asian and Arab countries. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, India, Indonesia, and other Asian and Arab countries, Mexico, and Chile voted in favor of the proposal, totaling twenty-one countries. The proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, France, and other countries was passed by a majority vote. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, India, Indonesia, and Syria, totaling thirteen countries, voted against it.

    白俄罗斯和波兰代表在联大全体会议上
    抨击美国横暴地干涉联合国事务的行为
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议在四月一日结束了关于联合国人事政策问题的讨论。
    关于这个问题的讨论是在三月十日开始的，非法担任联合国秘书长的赖伊在当天全体会议上提出了他的关于联合国人事政策的报告。这个忠实执行美国国务院命令的人在他的报告中，竭力企图为美国政府非法干涉联合国秘书处事务的行为辩解。赖伊承认，他曾经一再就联合国秘书处职员问题向美国政府请示。他并承认，他曾帮助美国联邦调查局公开对联合国职员的“忠诚情况”进行调查。在赖伊报告后，全体会议即休会。
    三月二十八日，全体会议又恢复讨论这个问题。美国代表洛奇发言支持赖伊报告。他并竭力企图为美国政府对联合国职员进行“忠诚调查”的行为辩解。他代表美、英、法三国及其他国家提出一项提案，要求联合国各会员国帮助秘书长来履行他的职务。
    在讨论过程中，白俄罗斯代表及波兰代表在会上发言抨击赖伊粗暴违反联合国宪章的行动，并要求制止这种行动。白俄罗斯代表指出，按照联合国宪章规定，秘书长在执行他的职务时决不能要求或接受任何政府或其他当局的指示，但是赖伊却根据美国的指示行事。赖伊任意解雇联合国职员以及帮助美国政府对联合国职员进行“忠诚调查”的非法行动，已经使联合国秘书处产生了不正常情况，已经损害了联合国的威信。赖伊这种行动已激起全世界舆论的正当愤慨。
    许多亚洲及阿拉伯国家代表也在会上发言抨击赖伊的非法行动。十二个亚洲及阿拉伯国家提出了一项提案，规定由十五个国家组成委员会来审查赖伊的报告，并向联合国第八届大会提出报告。提案中着重指出联合国的人事政策必须符合联合国宪章的宗旨和规定。
    印度代表在发言中说，赖伊所遵循的原则是与联合国这个国际组织的原则不相符合的，赖伊解雇拒绝美国忠诚调查的联合国职员的行为是侵犯人权的行为。叙利亚代表说，任何政府都无权在联合国职员问题上给秘书长以任何指示。但是赖伊却悍然破坏了这种原则，接受美国政府的指示。印度尼西亚代表说：大多数国家的代表团和世界舆论对于弥漫于联合国秘书处的不健康空气非常震惊，而这种情形是赖伊所造成的。印度尼西亚代表团谴责赖伊允许美国当局在联合国秘书处内强迫美籍职员填调查表和按手印的行动，这种行动必须被认为是不能容许的。伊拉克代表也强调说，赖伊这些行动是“不能令人容忍和真正使人厌恶的”。
    厄瓜多尔、墨西哥和智利等拉丁美洲国家代表也发言反对赖伊的行动。智利代表说，赖伊的人事政策损害了联合国的声誉。
    荷兰和澳大利亚代表也批评赖伊的报告。
    甚至与美国一同提出提案的法国和英国代表在发言中也对赖伊的行为表示不满。法国代表说，赖伊违反了联合国宪章的规定。任何国家的政府都无权干涉在它境内的联合国机构的事务，特别是不得在联合国办公地方进行调查。英国代表也不同意赖伊侵犯联合国总部所享有的权利的活动。
    四月一日全体会议对提案进行表决。美国操纵多数否决了十二个亚洲及阿拉伯国家提出的提案，投票赞成这个提案的有苏联、波兰、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、印尼和其他亚洲及阿拉伯国家、墨西哥、智利等二十一国代表团。美、英、法三国及其他国家提出的提案被多数通过，投票反对的有苏联、波兰、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、印尼和叙利亚等十三国代表团。
