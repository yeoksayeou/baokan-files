Correctly Implement the Cotton-Grain Price Ratio Policy
Chen Jingzhi

On April 1st, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council announced the 1953 cotton-grain price ratio: In wheat-producing areas, one jin of cotton is equivalent to 6.4 to 7.5 jin of wheat; in millet-producing areas, one jin of cotton is equivalent to 6.12 to 8 jin of millet; and in rice-producing areas, one jin of cotton is equivalent to 6.12 to 8 jin of rice. This new cotton-grain price ratio is in line with the requirements of the planned development of the people's economy and takes into account the long-term interests of cotton farmers.

Over the past three years, the People's Government has taken a series of measures to encourage increased cotton production, resulting in a rapid increase in the national cotton planting area and cotton yield. By 1952, the total national cotton production had exceeded 25 million dan, ensuring the needs of China's current cotton textile industry and civilian cotton wool, and changing the past situation of relying on imported cotton to supplement domestic cotton shortages. Now that cotton production can guarantee current domestic needs, failure to appropriately control the planting area and allowing it to continue to expand would lead to an imbalance between production and sales, and even affect the planting of food crops and the increase in grain production. This is unfavorable to the country and also unfavorable to cotton farmers. This year's cotton-grain price ratio will stabilize the cotton field planting area at the 1952 level, which is fully in line with the requirements of the planned development of the people's economy.

This year's cotton-grain price ratio takes into account the long-term interests of cotton farmers. Judging solely from the figures of this year's cotton-grain price ratio compared to last year, each jin of cotton can be exchanged for one to 1.4 jin less grain. However, calculating from the overall actual income of cotton farmers, their reasonable interests are maintained. Since liberation, due to the guidance and support of the People's Government for cotton farmers, and due to the improvement of cotton farmers' production conditions and planting techniques, the yield and quality of cotton per unit area have significantly improved. Therefore, although this year's cotton-grain price ratio has slightly decreased, the actual income of cotton farmers has not decreased much. The 1953 method for collecting agricultural tax on cotton fields has been changed from the original method of collecting taxes based on the average proportion of cotton field output to calculating taxes based on the normal grain yield, which further takes into account the interests of cotton farmers after the reasonable decline in the cotton-grain price ratio. Furthermore, looking at the historical cotton-grain price ratio: In 1936, the average annual price of cotton in the wheat-producing areas of Yuncheng, Xianyang, Weinan, and other markets was 5.5 jin of wheat per jin of cotton; in the millet-producing areas of Anyang, Fenyang, and other markets, the average annual price was 6.6 jin of millet per jin of cotton; and in the rice-producing areas of Changsha, Jiading, and other markets, the average annual price was 6.5 jin of rice per jin of cotton. This means that this year's cotton-grain price ratio is still much higher than the historical cotton-grain price ratio. The regional and seasonal price differences in old China were also extremely unreasonable, with rural prices being much lower than urban prices, and seasonal price differences being particularly large. This caused extremely serious damage to cotton farmers. Taking Weinan, Shaanxi as an example, from April to August 1936, each jin of cotton was equivalent to about 7.4 jin of wheat, but by September, when new cotton was on the market, one jin of cotton was only equivalent to 4.9 jin of wheat. This was a difference of 58% in one month. The seasonal price difference at that time only benefited landlords, rich peasants, and speculative merchants, while the vast majority of cotton farmers suffered from their exploitation. This kind of extra-economic exploitation can never be allowed to continue to exist in the people's China. Although this year's announced cotton-grain price ratio also pointed out that "a reasonable seasonal price difference should be maintained in each purchase season after the new cotton is on the market," its purpose is to take into account the losses of cotton farmers in storing cotton due to moisture drying and damage, and to compensate for reasonable capital interest and reserve expenses. Therefore, the seasonal price difference regulation is necessary and reasonable, and also takes into account the long-term interests of cotton farmers.

The newly stipulated cotton-grain price ratio this year is completely reasonable and timely, both from the perspective of the requirements of people's economic development and from the perspective of taking care of the long-term interests of cotton farmers.

Of course, there are some difficulties in the implementation of the new cotton-grain price ratio policy. These difficulties are mainly caused by certain shortcomings in last year's cotton purchase work.

Last year's cotton prices were too high, and there were no seasonal price differences. After cotton farmers harvested their cotton, they immediately rushed to sell it, causing extremely crowded selling conditions. In many areas, hundreds and thousands of cotton farmers lined up to sell cotton, and after selling the cotton, they could not immediately get their money back. On the part of state-owned companies and cooperatives, the changes in the cotton market situation led to serious passive situations, such as insufficient purchases, failures in capital scheduling, and difficulties in warehousing and storage, which added many difficulties for cotton farmers to sell cotton and caused dissatisfaction among cotton farmers. In addition, in some areas, in leading production and organizing purchases, they did not adopt economic methods through market activities and political work methods acceptable to farmers to achieve the predetermined plan, but instead proceeded from actual conditions, adopted mandatory implementation and rigid regulations, adding many unnecessary procedures and restrictions for cotton farmers. Some cotton farmers reflected: "Planting two mu of cotton keeps the whole family busy, topping and picking are very laborious, and statistics and reports are all-encompassing." A cotton farmer in Jiangsu reflected: "To sell cotton, you must first go to the township government to get a (written) certificate, and then go to the cotton collection station in this district to sell it. Sometimes, in order to get a certificate, you have to go back and forth several times to find the township head. After the certificate is finally written, when you get to the district collection station, either it's too late or they say they don't have money and won't buy it. Selling cotton is really a pain."

The shortcomings in last year's cotton purchase work will have an impact on cotton farmers' planting enthusiasm this year. According to reports from some areas, some cotton farmers still have ideological concerns about being "controlled" again when selling cotton; some local cadres are afraid that the purchasing departments will repeat some of the mistakes in last year's cotton purchase, so they also lack confidence and dare not righteously encourage cotton farmers to increase their yield per unit area and actively increase production. If these ideological concerns cannot be resolved as soon as possible, it will be detrimental to completing this year's cotton production tasks. The new cotton-grain price ratio is not intended to limit cotton production, but to require increasing the yield per unit area and increasing production without expanding the cotton field planting area. The cotton planting season is approaching. All cotton-producing areas need to conduct extensive publicity on the spirit and purpose of the cotton-grain price ratio stipulated by the People's Government in light of the ideological situation of cotton farmers, so that the vast number of cotton farmers can understand the spirit of this policy. We must not only pay attention to preventing the blind expansion of the cotton planting area from affecting the increase in grain production, but also pay attention to not reducing the cotton field, so as not to affect the supply of industrial raw materials and civilian cotton wool next year. Business departments related to cotton purchase should summarize the experience of last year's cotton collection work, correct shortcomings, make preparations, and explain the situation to cotton farmers to dispel unnecessary ideological concerns among cotton farmers, actively guide and help cotton farmers increase their yield per unit area, and complete the great task of cotton production this year.

    正确贯彻棉粮比价政策
    陈静之
    四月一日政务院财政经济委员会公布了一九五三年的棉粮比价，在小麦区，一斤棉花等于六斤四两至七斤半小麦，在小米区，一斤棉花等于六斤十二两至八斤小米，在大米区，一斤棉花等于六斤十二两至八斤大米。这一新的棉粮比价是符合人民经济有计划发展的要求，并照顾到棉农的长远利益的。
    三年以来，人民政府曾采取了一系列的鼓励棉花增产的措施，使全国植棉面积和棉花产量迅速增加，到一九五二年，全国棉花总产量已超过二千五百万担，保证了我国目前棉纺织业与民用絮棉的需要，改变了过去依靠外棉进口补助国棉不足的情况。在棉花生产已能保证国内当前需要的情况下，如不适当控制种植面积，而听凭其继续扩大，就会发生产销不平衡现象，甚至影响粮食作物的种植与粮食的增产，这对国家是不利的，对棉农也是不利的。今年的棉粮比价，将可使今年棉田种植面积稳定在一九五二年植棉面积水平上，它是完全符合人民经济有计划发展的要求的。
    今年的棉粮比价照顾了棉农的长远利益。单从今年与去年棉粮比价的数字上看，每斤棉花是少换了一斤至一斤四两粮食，但从棉农的整个实际收入计算，则是保持了棉农的合理利益。解放以来，由于人民政府对于棉农的指导与扶植，由于棉农生产条件与种植技术的改进，使棉花单位面积产量和质量均有显著提高，因此今年棉粮比价虽稍为降低，但棉农实际收入，减少并不多。一九五三年征收棉田农业税办法，已由原来的按棉田应产量平均比例征收，改为按常年粮食产量依率计征，这就更加照顾了棉粮比价合理下降后的棉农利益。再从历史上的棉粮比价情况看：一九三六年的棉花价格，在小麦区的运城、咸阳、渭南等市场，全年平均一斤棉花等于五斤半小麦；在小米区的安阳、汾阳等市场，全年平均一斤棉花等于六斤六两小米；在大米区的长沙、嘉定等市场，全年平均一斤棉花等于六斤半大米。这就是说，今年的棉粮比价，比历史上的棉粮比价还是高出很多的。旧中国的地区差价与季节差价也极不合理，乡村价格低于城市价格很多，季节差价特别大，这对棉农是一种极为严重的损害。以陕西渭南为例，一九三六年四月至八月，每斤棉花等于七斤四两上下小麦，但到新花上市后的九月，一斤棉花就只等于四斤九两小麦了。一月之间相差了百分之五十八。当时的季节差价只是有利于地主富农和投机商人，而广大棉农则饱受其剥削。这种超经济的剥削，在人民的中国是决不能允许继续存在的。今年公布的棉粮比价，虽然也指出了“在新棉上市后，各收购季节中，应保持合理的季节差价”。但其目的是为了照顾存棉农民在储存棉花过程中因水分干燥伤耗的损失，并补偿合理的资金利息及储备费用，因此季节差价的规定是必要和合理的，也是照顾到棉农的长远利益的。
    今年新规定的棉粮比价，无论从人民经济发展的要求来说，或对棉农长远利益的照顾上来说，都是完全合理的，并且是适合时宜的。
    新的棉粮比价政策的执行，当然是存在着一些困难的。这种困难主要是去年收购棉花工作中的某些缺点造成的。
    去年棉花价格偏高，又没有季节差价，棉农收下棉花后，立即争先出卖，造成了出卖棉花极其拥挤的现象，很多地区成百成千棉农排队卖棉，卖了棉花又不能立时拿回钱来。在国营公司与合作社方面，则因棉花上市情况改变，造成收购不及，资金调度失灵，仓储保管困难的严重被动局面，给棉农售棉增加了很多困难，引起棉农不满。另外，有些地区在领导生产和组织收购方面，不是采取通过市场活动的经济方法和农民所能接受的政治工作方法来实现预定的计划，而是不从实际情况出发，采用命令执行，硬性规定的办法，给棉农增加了很多不必要的手续与限制。有些棉农反映说：“种上二亩棉，一家大小不得闲，顶尖拿杈多费工，统计报告样样全。”江苏有一个棉农反映：“卖棉花先到乡政府去打（写）证明，然后再到本区收花站去卖，有时为了打证明，要往返数次找乡长，证明好容易写好，到区收花站时，不是辰光迟了，就是说没有钞票不收购了。卖棉花真受治。”
    去年收购棉花工作中存在的缺点，对今年棉农植棉情绪是会有影响的。从某些地区的反映看来，部分棉农现在还存在着怕卖棉花再“受治”的思想顾虑；某些地方干部怕收购部门重犯去年收购棉花中的某些错误，因此也缺乏信心，不敢理直气壮地鼓励棉农提高单位面积产量，积极增加生产。这些思想顾虑如不能及早解决，对完成今年棉花生产任务是不利的。新棉粮比价的规定不是为了限制棉花增产，而是要求在不扩大棉田种植面积的情况下，提高单位面积产量，增加生产。目前种植棉花季节即将到来了，各产棉区需要针对棉农思想情况，将人民政府规定的棉粮比价的精神与目的，进行广泛的宣传，以使广大棉农能够明了这一政策的精神。既要注意防止盲目扩大棉花种植面积影响了粮食的增产，又要注意不使棉田减少，不能影响到明年工业原料和民用絮棉的供应。与收购棉花有关的业务部门应该总结去年收棉工作的经验，纠正缺点，做好准备，并向棉农说明情况，以解除棉农不必要的思想顾虑，积极指导与帮助棉农提高单位面积产量，以完成今年棉花生产的伟大任务。
