Xinhua News Agency, 21st: Paris "l'Humanité" reporter, Pierre Courtade, reported on the scene of the Korean-Chinese side bidding farewell to American and British prisoners of war in Kaesong on the 19th: The Korean People's Army song and dance troupe, consisting of eighty people, performed brilliant ensembles, choruses, and dances for the American and British prisoners of war on the afternoon of the 19th. The theme of the songs and dances was peace and friendship among the people of all countries. At the end of the museum where the repatriated prisoners of war were staying, a large stage was specially built. The position of the stage was very suitable, and even some stretcher-bound wounded soldiers could see the performance without moving from their beds. The masquerade dances and wonderful musical programs won warm applause from all the prisoners of war. In the evening, the Chinese People's Volunteers also performed ensembles, and finally a movie was shown. Many prisoners of war had tears in their eyes, expressing their gratitude to their Korean and Chinese friends. One prisoner of war said to me: "I will never forget their kind care for the rest of my life. The welcome party prepared for us on the other side cannot compare with the hospitality of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, because they treated us like friends from the beginning. In the last days of our departure from the prisoner-of-war camp, they were especially good to us."

    我方欢送英美战俘
    【新华社二十一日讯】巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌报道朝中方面十九日在开城欢送美英战俘的情形说：朝鲜人民军的由八十个人组成的歌舞团，在十九日下午向美英战俘表演了精采的合奏、合唱和舞蹈。歌舞的主题是各国人民间的和平与友谊。在被遣返的战俘留宿的博物馆的尽头，特地修筑了一个很大的舞台。舞台的地位很适中，甚至一些担架伤兵也用不着从床上移动就可以看到表演。化装舞蹈和精采的音乐节目博得了全体战俘的热烈掌声。晚上，中国人民志愿军也表演了合奏，最后还放映了一场电影。许多战俘的眼睛里都含着眼泪，表现出他们对朝鲜和中国朋友的感谢。一个战俘对我说：“我将终身不会忘记他们的亲切的关怀。在另一边为我们准备的欢迎会，是无论如何比不上朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军对我们的款待的，因为他们一开始就对我们像朋友一样。在我们离开战俘营的最后一段日子里，他们对我们尤其好。”
