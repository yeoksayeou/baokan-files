    (I) The All-China Federation of Trade Unions will convene the Seventh National Labor Congress in Beijing on May 2 this year. This is the first National Labor Congress after the founding of the People's Republic of China, when the Chinese working class became the leading class of the state. This congress is convened after our national economy has fully recovered and at the beginning of the first five-year plan for national construction. It is a major event in the historical process of the Chinese workers' movement and a major event for the Chinese working class. Trade union organizations at all levels should attach importance to the convening of this congress, carry out extensive and in-depth publicity among the broad masses of workers under the unified leadership of the local party committees, and strive to ensure that every worker understands the great significance of convening this congress and the glorious responsibility of the working class in completing the task of national construction.
    (II) The historical task of the Sixth National Labor Congress held in Harbin in August 1948 has been successfully completed. The central task of the Seventh National Labor Congress is: to clearly define the direction and tasks of the national workers' movement during the period of new democratic construction, to educate the entire working class to further recognize its position and responsibility as the leading class of the state, to mobilize workers across the country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, and to unite the people of the whole country to strive to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the task of national construction, to realize the industrialization of the country and to guide the development towards socialist and communist society. The main contents of the Seventh National Labor Congress will include: 1. Listening to the work summary of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the report on the future direction and tasks of the national trade union work. 2. Listening to the report of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on the revision of the Constitution of the Chinese Trade Union. 3. Listening to the report of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on the financial work of the national trade union. 4. Electing the Seventh Executive Committee and the Finance Examination Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
    (III) The Second Enlarged Plenary Session of the Sixth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, held in January this year, was a political and ideological preparation for the Seventh National Labor Congress. Before the convening of the Seventh National Labor Congress, trade union organizations at all levels must earnestly implement the resolution of the Second Enlarged Plenary Session of the Sixth Executive Committee, combine the study of documents, inspection of work, and the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines with the work of electing representatives to the Seventh National Labor Congress, and step up preparations for the convening of the Seventh National Labor Congress ideologically and organizationally. While publicizing the significance of convening the Seventh National Labor Congress to the broad masses of workers, they should, according to the specific conditions of various industries and regions, call on the masses of workers to launch patriotic labor emulation campaigns to ensure the completion of the state's production plans and basic construction plans, and welcome the convening of the Seventh National Labor Congress with the actual actions of the workers in production and construction.
    (IV) In the publicity about the Seventh National Labor Congress, the idea that the Chinese Communist Party has always been the leader of the Chinese workers' movement should be implemented. The masses of workers across the country should be introduced to the materials of previous National Labor Congresses. Through historical and realistic facts, the masses of workers across the country should be made aware that: the Chinese workers' movement only became a truly conscious revolutionary movement and developed along the road to victory after the Chinese Communist Party was founded and under the direct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, there would be no victory for the Chinese people, and the Chinese working class could not become the leading class of the state. In the future, the Chinese working class must still unite the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in order to consolidate its achieved victories and strive for the victory from new democracy to socialism. The great and brilliant Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party are the banner of victory for the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. The Chinese Communist Party is the highest form of organization of the Chinese working class. The trade union is a mass organization of the working class. The trade union must become a link between the Party and the masses of workers, and become, as Lenin said, "a school for learning management, a school for learning operation, and a school for communism." Trade union organizations at all levels should take this publicity as an opportunity to further raise the level of awareness of the broad masses of workers and the ideological level of trade union cadres.
    (V) The Seventh National Labor Congress is held on the second day of this year's May Day. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has not only invited representatives from various domestic fields, but also specially invited trade union representatives from the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, capitalist countries, and colonial and semi-colonial countries to participate. Therefore, in the publicity about the Seventh National Labor Congress, the education of uniting the people of all other classes in the country should be carried out to the masses of the working class across the country, especially the education of the worker-peasant alliance. The working class should play a model role in all aspects such as abiding by national policies and laws and completing national tasks. On the other hand, special emphasis should be placed on internationalist education, strengthening education on the unity among the working classes of all countries in the world. Emphasis should be placed on publicity: 1. To welcome the Seventh National Labor Congress, the masses of workers across the country should enhance the material strength of the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea with practical actions to increase production. 2. Strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and strive to learn from the Soviet Union. Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, learning from the communist labor attitude of the Soviet people, and learning the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are the most important guarantees for continuously improving the consciousness and ability of the Chinese working class and doing a good job in national construction. 3. Welcome trade union representatives from various countries to participate in the Seventh National Labor Congress in our country. The working class of the world is one family. The working class of the world unites, strengthens and consolidates the world peace, democracy and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthens the unity with all peace-loving people in the world, and defends lasting peace in the Far East and the world.
    (VI) The publicity about the Seventh National Labor Congress should become one of the important contents of current affairs and political publicity to the masses of workers across the country. Trade union organizations at all levels, especially grass-roots organizations in factories and mines, should carry out this publicity under the unified leadership of the Party committee, and closely integrate this publicity with the current production publicity, so that this publicity becomes a force to mobilize the broad masses of workers to complete the state's production plans, solve key problems in production, ensure product quality, ensure safe production, and strive to reduce costs, and launch labor emulation. To this end, trade union organizations in various places should convene appropriate mass meetings, invite responsible comrades from local Party committees and trade union organizations to report to the masses of workers and explain the issue of convening the Seventh National Labor Congress, and organize mass discussions, and mobilize various propaganda and education organizations and tools of trade unions to carry out this publicity.

    中华全国总工会关于召开第七次全国劳动大会的宣传大纲
    （一）今年五月二日，中华全国总工会将要在北京召开第七次全国劳动大会。这是中华人民共和国成立以后，中国工人阶级成为国家领导阶级后的第一次全国劳动大会。这次大会召开于我们的国家经济完全恢复之后，第一个国家建设的五年计划开始之时，是中国工人运动历史进程中的一件大事，中国工人阶级的一件大事。各级工会组织，都应重视这次大会的召开，在各地党委的统一领导下，在广大工人群众中进行广泛而深入的宣传，力求做到每一个工人群众都知道召开这次大会的重大意义和工人阶级对于完成国家建设任务的光荣责任。
    （二）一九四八年八月在哈尔滨召开的第六次全国劳动大会的历史任务已经胜利地完成。第七次全国劳动大会的中心任务是：明确规定新民主主义建设时期全国工人运动的方针任务，教育全体工人阶级进一步认识自己作为国家领导阶级的地位和责任，动员全国工人在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，充分发挥工人阶级的积极性和创造性，并团结全国人民一致努力，为保证完成和超过国家建设的任务，实现国家的工业化并引导向社会主义和共产主义社会发展而斗争。第七次全国劳动大会的主要内容将包括：1、听取中华全国总工会执行委员会的工作总结及今后全国工会工作方针、任务的报告。2、听取中华全国总工会执行委员会关于修改中国工会章程的报告。3、听取中华全国总工会执行委员会关于全国工会财务工作的报告。4、选举中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会和经费审查委员会。
    （三）中华全国总工会在今年一月召开的第六届二次执委扩大会议，是第七次全国劳动大会在政治上和思想上的准备。在第七次全国劳动大会召开以前，各级工会组织必须切实贯彻六届二次执委扩大会议的决议，把学习文件、检查工作、反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争，与选举第七次全国劳动大会代表的工作结合起来，从思想上和组织上加紧做好召开第七次全国劳动大会的准备工作。并在向广大工人群众宣传召开第七次全国劳动大会的意义的同时，根据各产业、各地区的具体情况，号召工人群众开展爱国主义的劳动竞赛运动，保证完成国家的生产计划和基本建设计划，以工人群众在生产建设上的实际行动，来迎接第七次全国劳动大会的召开。
    （四）在关于第七次劳动大会的宣传中，应贯彻中国共产党一直是中国工人运动的领导者的思想。应向全国工人群众介绍历次全国劳动大会的资料，通过历史的及现实的各种事实，向全国工人群众说明：中国的工人运动，是在中国共产党产生以后，并在中国共产党的直接领导下，才成为真正自觉的革命的运动，而沿着胜利的道路发展起来的。没有中国共产党的领导，就没有中国人民的胜利，中国工人阶级也就不可能成为国家的领导阶级。中国工人阶级今后仍必须在中国共产党的领导下，团结全国人民，才能巩固自己已得的胜利，并争取从新民主主义到社会主义的胜利。伟大的英明的毛主席和中国共产党是中国工人阶级和中国人民胜利的旗帜。中国共产党是中国工人阶级组织的最高形式。工会是工人阶级的群众组织。工会必须成为党联系工人群众的引带，成为列宁所说的“是学习管理的学校，学习经营的学校，共产主义的学校”。各级工会组织应通过这次宣传，将广大工人群众的觉悟程度和工会干部的思想水平都提高一步。
        （五）第七次全国劳动大会是在今年的五一劳动节的第二天召开的。中华全国总工会不但邀请了国内各方面的代表，而且特别邀请了苏联、人民民主国家、资本主义国家及殖民地半殖民地国家的工会代表参加。因此，在关于第七次全国劳动大会的宣传中，应向全国工人阶级群众进行团结全国其他各阶级人民的教育，特别要加强工农联盟的教育，工人阶级在遵守国家政策法令和完成国家任务等各方面，要起模范作用。另一方面，要特别加强国际主义的教育，加强关于世界各国工人阶级间的团结的教育，应着重宣传：1、迎接七次劳大，全国工人群众应以提高生产的实际行动，来增强抗美援朝斗争的物质力量。2、加强中苏友好，努力学习苏联。学习苏联的先进经验，学习苏联人民的共产主义的劳动态度，学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，这是不断提高中国工人阶级的觉悟与能力，搞好国家建设的最重要的保证。3、欢迎来我国参加第七次全国劳动大会的各国工会代表。全世界工人阶级是一家。全世界工人阶级团结起来，加强和巩固以苏联为首的世界和平民主社会主义阵营，加强与世界各国一切爱好和平人民的团结，保卫远东和世界的持久和平。
        （六）关于第七次全国劳动大会的宣传，应成为目前向全国工人阶级群众进行时事政治宣传的重要内容之一。各级工会组织，特别是厂矿中的基层组织，均应在党委的统一领导下，进行这一宣传，并使这一宣传与当前的生产宣传紧密结合起来，使得这一宣传，成为动员广大工人群众为完成国家的生产计划，解决生产中的关键问题，保证产品质量，保证安全生产，努力降低成本，展开劳动竞赛的力量。为此，各地工会组织，应召开适当的群众会议，约请当地党委和工会组织的负责同志，向工人群众作报告，讲解关于召开第七次全国劳动大会的问题，和组织群众讨论，并动员工会各种宣传教育的组织和工具来进行这一宣传。（新华社）
