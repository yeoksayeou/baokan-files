Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 2nd: Newspapers in the German Democratic Republic, Romania, and Hungary have published editorials supporting the statement by China's Premier Zhou Enlai on the Korean armistice negotiations.

Berlin Dispatch: Major newspapers in the German Democratic Republic have all published Premier Zhou Enlai's statement. "Neues Deutschland" said in its commentary: This once again proves that the peace-loving governments of China and North Korea have always been considering a swift end to the Korean War.

According to the Romanian News Agency, all Bucharest newspapers published Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on April 1st. "Scînteia," in its commentary on the statement, pointed out that the Chinese and North Korean sides have consistently demonstrated a firm and sincere desire for peace in the armistice negotiations. The path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean War is what the people of all countries hope for and support. The Romanian people, together with the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, stand even more closely with the heroic Korean people and the great Chinese people, wholeheartedly supporting the proposals of the Chinese and North Korean sides, believing that the realization of this proposal is the only way to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

"Free Romania" wrote in its commentary: The peace-loving Romanian people, together with all peace-loving people in the world, see in the just and fair suggestions put forward by the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea a way to end the Korean War.

According to the Hungarian News Agency, major Hungarian newspapers published the full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on March 31st. On April 1st, the newspapers published editorials commenting on it. "Szabad Nép" stated in its editorial titled "Striving for Peace in Korea": Zhou Enlai's statement puts forward a method for resolving the issue of prisoners of war, thereby demonstrating the peaceful intentions of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. This statement is a particularly important step in the effort to achieve peace in Korea. The Chinese and North Korean proposal to resume armistice negotiations has been welcomed by people all over the world. If the US imperialists can be forced to reopen negotiations, it will be due to the will of the Chinese and North Korean sides to strive for peace, the unbreakable strength of the people's forces, and the pressure from the masses. The editorial continued: Achieving peace in Korea is a matter for all people, because the Korean War is a danger that threatens the whole world. We, the Hungarian people, are also clearly aware of this. Therefore, the Hungarian people fully support the peaceful aspirations of the Chinese and North Korean peoples, and unite their ranks more closely, making their voices for peace even louder in the powerful peace camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The editorial in "Magyar Nemzet" stated: Zhou Enlai's statement is of world importance, and the Chinese and North Korean sides are striving to resolve the issue of prisoners of war and end the Korean War.

The commentary in the Hungarian trade union newspaper "Népszava" stated: "The governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have satisfied the desire of the people of all countries for peace. This new proposal, put forward in the spirit of Stalin's peace policy, reflects the will of all mankind for peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 2nd: London's "Daily Worker" published an editorial on April 1st, commenting on the statement by China's Premier Zhou Enlai on March 30th, titled "Need for Action." The editorial said: If the people can use their power to ensure that negotiations begin now, and can use Zhou Enlai's proposal as the basis for the successful conclusion of these negotiations, then the future of peace in Korea is very bright. The editorial pointed out: The importance of Zhou Enlai's proposal is self-evident. The proposal has not abandoned its original position based on the principles of the Geneva Convention, nor has it accepted the American claim that there are prisoners of war who do not wish to be repatriated; however, the Chinese government has put forward this new proposal for the sake of world peace. Prisoners of war who insist on repatriation should be repatriated. The remaining prisoners of war should be handed over to neutral countries "to ensure a fair resolution of their repatriation issues." These are proposals that currently mean peace. Therefore, these proposals have been welcomed by the people of the world and the soldiers at the front.

The editorial called on the British people: Now is not the time to relax the struggle for peace, but to intensify the struggle for peace. Now is the time for action. Let us send a flood of resolutions and telegrams to the Prime Minister and Members of Parliament, demanding that they fully support China's new proposal in order to achieve peace in Korea now. If the people act resolutely, they will be able to crush any delaying and evasive tactics.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 1st: London Dispatch: The British Peace Committee issued a statement on the night of March 30th, praising the statement by China's Premier Zhou Enlai on the Korean armistice negotiations as a "new and hopeful proposal" for resuming the Korean armistice negotiations. The statement said: It is important to make the British government fully aware that peace is the wish of the British people, and to make the government take action to reach an agreement. Therefore, the Executive Committee of the British Peace Committee asks all peace-loving people to tell Members of Parliament, party leaders, and government officials about their views through meetings, sending representatives, and sending telegrams.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 2nd: France's "L'Humanité," in commenting on the French public opinion's reaction to the statement by China's Premier Zhou Enlai on the Korean armistice negotiations, said that the French masses generally praised Zhou Enlai's statement. The Chinese proposal has received widespread support, and even the reactionary newspapers have had to express their support.

The editorial in "L'Humanité" on April 1st pointed out: The American rulers have suffered defeats in military, political, and diplomatic aspects. The US military has lost more than 300,000 people in Korea, while the Korean army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have greatly strengthened. Despite the threat of aggression against People's China, it has carried out restoration work very well and has victoriously crushed the criminal offensive of germ warfare. It is under these conditions that the proposals repeatedly put forward by People's China have left a very deep impression on the United States.

"L'Humanité" said: The peace proposal put forward by the government of People's China does not abandon the principle of immediate release and repatriation of prisoners of war after the armistice in accordance with the Geneva Convention. The French people are determined to strengthen their actions so that the discussion on the peace proposal can be successful.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 1st: Brussels Dispatch: The Belgian Communist Party's newspaper "Le Drapeau Rouge" published Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the Korean armistice negotiations at great length. The editorial in "Le Drapeau Rouge" on April 1st stated: The proposals of China and North Korea have brought hope and confidence to the people of all countries. Zhou Enlai once again put forward this new, important proposal aimed at ending the Korean War, which strikes at the war-mongers' plans to expand the Korean slaughter. The editorial said that since March 30th, the prospect of a possible armistice in Korea and the easing of international tensions has caused panic among the arms dealers.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 2nd: Copenhagen Dispatch: Newspapers in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden all published Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the Korean armistice negotiations on the front page. The newspapers of the Communist Parties of the three countries all published commentaries supporting the statement.

The editorial in Denmark's "Land og Folk" on April 1st stated: This proposal has won the unanimous support of the people around the world who yearn for and strive for peace. Peace could have been achieved earlier when the representatives of China and North Korea proposed a ceasefire during the armistice negotiations in the past, and when Soviet representative Vyshinsky put forward his proposal at the United Nations last year. However, every effort to achieve peace in the past has been undermined by the United States and its vassal states. Now the new proposal of China and North Korea has given people new hope. However, peace will not come on its own, so Danish public opinion must express their demands. The Danish government has a responsibility to tell the US government without hesitation that accepting the proposals of China and North Korea is the demand of the Danish people.

The editorial in Norway's "Friheten" stated: The Chinese and North Korean proposal to resume armistice negotiations provides hope. The current situation provides the possibility for the world's forces for peace to achieve a major victory. But victory will not come automatically. Victory must be striven for by us, and the people themselves must carry out more extensive activities, demanding the immediate resumption of armistice negotiations and the cessation of all hostilities in Korea.

Sweden's "Arbetartidningen" believes that the recent proposal by China and North Korea is an "important demonstration" of the desire for peace by the countries where the people are in power. The Chinese proposal meets the requirements for a fair resolution of the prisoner of war issue. Its purpose is to quickly establish peace in Korea and to ease the global situation. This is in the interests of the people of all countries around the world.

    人民民主国家报纸纷纷发表评论
    拥护和支持中朝两国的建议
    英、法、比、丹、挪、瑞典等国进步报纸支持周总理声明
    【新华社布拉格二日电】德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚及匈牙利报纸纷纷发表评论，拥护我国周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明。
    柏林消息：德意志民主共和国的主要报纸都刊载了周恩来总理的声明。“新德意志报”在评论中说：这再次证明爱好和平的中朝两国政府一向都考虑着尽速结束朝鲜战争。
    据罗马尼亚通讯社消息，布加勒斯特各报四月一日都登载了周恩来总理的声明。“火花报”在评论这个声明时指出，中朝方面在停战谈判过程中始终表现了谋求和平的坚定而真诚的愿望。和平解决朝鲜战争的道路是各国人民所希望并支持的。罗马尼亚人民和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营在一起，更加紧密地和英勇的朝鲜人民及伟大的中国人民站在一起，全心全意地支持中朝方面的建议，他们认为实现这个建议是和平解决朝鲜问题的唯一道路。
    “自由罗马尼亚报”在评论中写道：爱好和平的罗马尼亚人民和世界各国所有爱好和平的人民在一起，从中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所提出的正义的公平的建议中看到了能够结束朝鲜战争的办法。
    据匈牙利通讯社消息，匈牙利各大报三月三十一日都刊载了周恩来总理声明全文。各报在四月一日发表社论加以评论。“自由人民报”在题为“争取朝鲜和平”的社论中说：周恩来的声明提出了解决战俘问题的方法，从而表明了中国政府和中国人民的和平意图，这个声明是争取朝鲜和平的努力中的一个具有特别重要意义的步骤。中朝方面所提出的恢复停战谈判的建议，受到全世界人民的欢迎。如果能够迫使美帝国主义者重开谈判，那都是由于中朝方面争取和平的意志，人民队伍的牢不可破的力量以及人民群众的压力所致。社论接着说：实现朝鲜和平是一切人民的事情，因为朝鲜战争是威胁全世界的一种危险。我们匈牙利人民也清楚地知道这一点。所以匈牙利人民全力支持中朝人民的和平愿望，并把他们的队伍团结得更加紧密，在以苏联为首的强大的和平阵营中使他们要求和平的呼声更为响亮。
    “匈牙利民族”的社论中说：周恩来的声明是具有世界重要性的，中朝方面努力求得解决战俘问题和结束朝鲜战争。
    匈牙利工会机关报“人民之声”的评论中说：“中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府满足了世界各国人民要求和平的愿望。根据斯大林和平政策的精神提出的这个新建议，反映了全人类要求和平的意志。”
    【新华社布拉格二日电】伦敦“工人日报”四月一日发表社论，评论我国周恩来总理三月三十日的声明，题为“需要行动”。社论说：如果人民能运用他们的权力，保证谈判现在就开始进行，并能以周恩来的建议作基础使这谈判胜利结束，那么，朝鲜的和平前途是很光明的。社论指出：周恩来的建议的重要性是不言而喻的。建议并没有放弃它原来根据日内瓦公约的原则所采取的立场，也没有接受美国所谓有不愿遣返的战俘的说法；然而，中国政府为着世界的和平利益，提出了这个新建议。双方坚持遣返的战俘应该予以遣返。其余的战俘应该转交给中立国，“以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决”。这些都是目前意味着和平的建议。因此这些建议受到了全世界人民和前线的士兵们的欢迎。
    社论号召英国人民说：现在不是放松和平斗争的时候，而是加紧和平斗争的时候。现在是行动的时候。让我们把洪水般源源不绝的决议案和电报送给首相和国会议员们吧，要求他们用全力支持中国的新建议，以求现在实现朝鲜和平。如果人民坚决地行动起来，他们是能够粉碎任何拖延和逃避的伎俩的。
    【新华社布拉格一日电】伦敦消息：英国和平委员会三月三十日夜发表声明，赞扬我国周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明是恢复朝鲜停战谈判的“新的、有希望的建议”。声明说：重要的是应使英国政府充分了解和平是英国人民的愿望，应使政府采取行动来达成协议。因此，英国和平委员会执行委员会要求所有爱好和平的人士以会见、派遣代表及打电报的方式，把他们这种意见告诉议员、党派领袖和政府官员。
    【新华社布拉格二日电】法国“人道报”在评论法国舆论对我国周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明的反应时说，法国人民群众普遍赞扬周恩来的声明。中国的建议受到广泛的支持，甚至使反动报纸也不得不表示支持。
    “人道报”四月一日的社论中指出：美国统治者已在军事、政治和外交各方面都遭到了失败。美军在朝鲜损失了三十多万人，而朝鲜军队和中国人民志愿军已大大加强了。尽管人民中国受到侵略的威胁，它仍很好地进行了恢复工作，并胜利地粉碎了细菌战的罪恶进攻。正是在这些条件下，人民中国反复提出的建议已在美国留下了极深刻的印象。
    “人道报”说：人民中国政府提出的和平建议，丝毫没有放弃停战以后根据日内瓦公约立即释放并遣返战俘的原则。法国人民已决心加强行动，以便使关于和平建议的讨论能够成功。
    【新华社布拉格一日电】布鲁塞尔消息：比利时共产党机关报“红旗报”以很大篇幅刊载周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明。“红旗报”四月一日的社论中说：中朝两国的建议给各国人民带来了希望和信心。周恩来再度提出了这个新的、重要的、目的在于结束朝鲜战争的建议，这个建议打击了战争贩子扩大朝鲜屠杀的计划。社论说，从三月三十日以来，朝鲜可能停战的前景和国际紧张局势的缓和已引起了军火商人们的惊慌。
    【新华社布拉格二日电】哥本哈根消息：丹麦、挪威、瑞典三国报纸都在第一版刊载了我国周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明。三国共产党机关报都发表评论，支持这个声明。
    丹麦“国土与人民报”一日的社论中说：这个建议已赢得全世界热望和平与争取和平的人民的一致拥护。过去在朝中代表在停战谈判期间提议停战的时候，在苏联代表维辛斯基去年在联合国提出他的建议的时候，和平本来是早就可以获得的。然而，过去每次争取和平的努力都被美国及其附庸国破坏了。现在中朝两国的新建议又使人产生了新的希望。但是，和平是不会自己到来的，因此，丹麦舆论必须表明他们的要求。丹麦政府负有责任毫不犹豫地告诉美国政府，接受中朝方面建议是丹麦人民的要求。
    挪威“自由报”社论中说：朝中方面关于恢复停战谈判的建议提供了希望。目前的局势为全世界和平力量取得重大胜利提供了可能。但是胜利是不会自动到来的。胜利必须我们去争取，必须人民自己进行更广泛的活动，要求立即恢复停战谈判，停止在朝鲜的一切敌对行动。
    瑞典“工人报”认为中朝方面最近的建议是人民当权的国家要求和平的“重要明证”，中国建议满足了公正解决战俘问题的要求，它的目的是在朝鲜迅速建立和平，并使全世界局势缓和。这是符合全世界各国人民的利益的。
