    Re-examining the Plan for Research and Construction Conditions
    First Ministry of Machine Building Corrects Impetuous Tendencies
    [This newspaper dispatch] In order to base the plan on a reliable foundation, the First Ministry of Machine Building has recently spent more than a month studying the construction conditions of each project in detail, reducing some projects that did not meet the conditions, and finally determined the capital construction plan for this year; at the same time, it has taken some positive measures to strengthen weak links to ensure the completion of this plan.
    The First Ministry of Machine Building's capital construction plan for this year has been reviewed three times. In the process of reviewing and revising the plan, the idea of impetuosity has been gradually overcome. When the capital construction plan was prepared in the fourth quarter of last year, many factory leaders had the idea of "being happy with the new and tired of the old." They mistakenly understood the state's policy of "putting capital construction in the primary position," and without actively trying to give full play to the capacity of existing equipment, and without considering objective and subjective conditions, they blindly proposed expansion and reconstruction plans. For example, the site of the Anhui Machine Factory had been flooded twice, but it still proposed an expansion plan. The First Ministry of Machine Building resolutely opposed this idea of "being happy with the new and tired of the old" during the first review of the plan, and reduced secondary and unnecessary construction projects. However, the design strength of the First Ministry of Machine Building was insufficient; and because it could not accurately grasp the interrelationships and coordination of various industrial developments within and outside the Ministry for a long time, it took a long time to review the product plans of various factories, so the plan task book could not be approved for a long time, affecting the rapid progress of the design. At the same time, the technical strength of construction was also insufficient, and the delay in design delayed the start of construction, resulting in a situation where the construction task was loose in the first half of the year and tight in the second half of the year. In view of this situation, the First Ministry of Machine Building reviewed the capital construction plan again in February this year, and removed all general factory buildings that did not have the conditions to realize the plan or had insufficient conditions. For example, the reconstruction projects of Shanghai Electric Machine Factory and General Machine Factory with an investment of more than 100 billion yuan were postponed to next year because the design could not be completed on schedule; school and dormitory projects were also reduced, except for units that had to be built; in order to concentrate the existing capital construction force on the nine key projects that are decisive for the country's industrialization. After this review, the number of projects in the plan has been greatly reduced, but from the specific situation of each project, especially the design and construction strength, equipment and material supply of key projects, the plan is still risky. In order to base the plan on a reliable foundation, the First Ministry of Machine Building, in late March, thoroughly studied the conditions for the realization of each key project plan together with the professional bureaus and factories with capital construction tasks, and finally determined the plan for this year. After this review, the workload of many key projects has been reduced. For example, the Fushun Electrical and Mechanical Factory originally planned to start construction in May, but now because the product tasks have changed and the design needs to be revised, the first assembly workshop and riveting workshop project originally planned to be completed this year will be completed next year. The foreign design drawings of Factory 652 could not arrive in time due to inaccurate information provided, and the supply of some materials was not timely, so the original plan to strive for the basic completion of the forging, non-ferrous metal repair, mechanical assembly, woodworking and auxiliary five workshops this year was obviously impossible to achieve. It is now determined that the woodworking and auxiliary two workshops will only complete 68% of the workload this year, and the forging, non-ferrous metal repair and mechanical assembly three workshops will only complete prefabricated parts processing and foundation engineering this year. In total, the construction area of the plan approved by the First Ministry of Machine Building this time is equivalent to 66% of the initially determined area, which is 3.07 times that of last year.
    While overcoming the idea of impetuosity from the planning aspect, the First Ministry of Machine Building also took the following positive measures to ensure the completion of this year's construction plan: (1) Clearly stipulate the responsibilities of the Ministry, professional bureaus, factories and both parties of Jia (construction unit) and Yi (construction unit) for capital construction, and overcome the negative ideas such as "waiting" and "dependence" generated by the bureaus and factories after the unified leadership of design and construction by the Ministry. (2) The general layout design drawing must be very accurate. After it is done well, technical design and construction drawings should be carried out simultaneously according to the priority of the construction plan, and efforts should be made to submit part of the design drawings to the construction department for construction as soon as possible, without having to wait for the completion of all technical designs before doing construction drawings. At the same time, it was decided to give full play to the guiding role of Soviet experts, and according to their opinions, prepare the design points before the design, and carry out the design only after they have reviewed them, in order to improve the design quality and reduce rework. (3) Dormitory and school projects should use standard design drawings as much as possible, and strive to start construction in the first half of the year, so that they can concentrate their efforts on building factory buildings in the second half of the year. (4) In addition to strengthening the equipment and material supply agencies and establishing a responsibility system, it is also necessary to organize the strength of four aspects: transfer 200 riveting and welding workers to the construction department; organize a 100-person boiler installation team to be responsible for the installation of boilers in various factories; strengthen the drilling force to do a good job of geological data for next year's design; adjust Russian translation talents and make full use of the translation force.

    研究建设条件重新审核计划
    第一机械工业部纠正冒进倾向
    【本报讯】为使计划建立在可靠的基础上，最近一个多月来，第一机械工业部详细研究了每一项工程的建设条件，削减了一些条件不具备的工程项目，最后确定了今年的基本建设计划；同时采取了一些积极的办法来加强薄弱环节，以保证完成这一计划。
    第一机械工业部今年的基本建设计划已经审核过三次，在审核和修改计划的过程中，逐步克服了冒进思想。去年第四季度编制基本建设计划时，有不少工厂的领导干部有“喜新厌旧”的思想。他们错误地理解国家“把基本建设放在首要地位”的方针，不积极设法充分发挥现有设备的能力，不考虑客观的和主观的条件，就盲目地提出了扩充和改建计划。如安徽机器厂的厂址已被水淹过两次，也提出了扩大建设的计划。第一机械工业部第一次审核计划时，就坚决反对这种“喜新厌旧”的思想，把次要的和可以不建设的项目削减了。但是，第一机械工业部的设计力量不足；并且由于很长时期不能准确掌握部内、部外各种工业发展的相互关系和配合情况，审查各厂产品方案时需要较长的时间，所以计划任务书迟迟未能审定，影响设计不能迅速进行。同时，施工的技术力量也不够，加上设计迟缓，推迟了开工时间，形成了上半年施工任务松，下半年施工任务紧的情况。鉴于这种情况，第一机械工业部在今年二月间再次审核基本建设计划，把凡是不具备实现计划的条件或条件不足的一般厂房建设都削掉了。如上海电机厂、通用机器厂等投资一千亿元以上的改建工程，由于设计不能按期完成，决定推迟到明年再进行；学校和宿舍工程，除了实在不得不修建的单位外，也都削减了；以便把现有的基本建设力量集中使用到对国家工业化有决定意义的九大重点工程去。经过这一次审核，计划中的项目大大减少了，但是从每一项工程，特别是重点工程的设计和施工力量、设备和材料的供应等具体情况来看，计划还是很冒险的。为了把计划建立在可靠的基础上，第一机械工业部在三月下旬，又和各专业局及有基本建设任务的工厂，共同彻底研究了每项重点工程计划的实现条件，最后确定了今年的计划。经过这一次审查，许多重点工程的工作量都减少了。如抚顺机电厂原计划在五月份开工，现在因为产品任务改变需要修改设计，就把原计划在今年完成的第一装配车间和铆焊车间工程改到明年去完成了。六五二厂的国外设计图纸，因供给的资料不准确，不能及时到达，有些材料的供应也不及时，因此原定争取今年基本完成锻工、有色金属修理、机械装配、木工和辅助五个车间的计划，显然是不可能实现的。现在确定：木工和辅助两个车间今年只完成工作量百分之六十八，锻工、有色金属修理和机械装配三个车间，今年只完成预制品加工和基础工程。总计第一机械工业部这次审定的计划的建筑面积，相当于最初确定的百分之六十六，等于去年的三点零七倍。
    第一机械工业部在从计划方面克服冒进思想的同时，又采取了下列的积极办法，保证今年建设计划的完成：（一）明确规定部、专业局、工厂和甲（建设单位）乙（施工单位）双方对于基本建设的责任，克服局和厂一级由于设计、施工统一归部领导以后产生的“等待”和“依赖”等消极思想。（二）总布置设计图必须做得十分正确。做好以后，即按施工计划的先后，同时进行技术设计和绘制施工图，争取早日把部分设计图交施工部门施工，不必等待做好全部技术设计后再做施工图。同时，决定充分发挥苏联专家的指导作用，根据他们的意见，在设计前做好设计要点，并经他们审查后才进行设计，以便提高设计质量，减少返工。（三）宿舍和学校工程，尽量采用标准设计图，争取在上半年施工，以便下半年集中力量修筑厂房。（四）除加强设备、材料供应机构，建立责任制以外，还要组织四方面的力量：抽调二百名铆焊工人给施工部门；组织一个一百人的锅炉安装队，负责安装各厂的锅炉；加强钻探力量，为明年设计做好地质资料工作；调整俄文翻译人材，充分利用翻译力量。
