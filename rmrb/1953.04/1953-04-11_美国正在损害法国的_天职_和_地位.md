The U.S. is undermining France's "Divine Mission" and "Status"
Cui Qi

Recently, French Prime Minister Mayer, accompanied by several of his ministers, visited Washington and held talks with senior U.S. government officials on issues such as the Vietnam War and the "European Army." Before going to the United States, Mayer delivered an "important speech" in Montélimar, saying that France was ready to serve the European aggressive bloc "as long as people recognize its status as a world power, as long as they guarantee it the means to carry out its mission without denying any of its divine missions, and without undermining its French Federation." The Associated Press reported: "Mayer's main purposes in going to the United States are twofold: to exchange France's rapid approval of the European Army for more U.S. aid at home and abroad; and to make the United States pay attention to France's demands as a world power." Why is Mayer so concerned about France's "divine mission" and "status"? This is because today's French ruling clique deeply feels that whenever they deal with the United States, their "divine mission" is interfered with and their "status" is undermined.

In the eyes of the French ruling clique, invading Vietnam, slaughtering the Vietnamese people, manipulating the Vietnamese Bảo Đại puppet regime, and plundering Vietnamese rice... this is their "divine mission." However, harsh reality forces the French ruling clique to admit that France no longer has the strength to undertake this "divine mission." In the long war of aggression against Vietnam, the French colonial army has consumed a large amount of manpower and material resources and is now on the verge of destruction. The French newspaper "Le Monde" wrote sadly: "France's blood is drying up," and France is "losing itself" in Vietnam. France cannot continue this criminal war of aggression without relying on the United States. For years, the United States has been bearing one-third of France's military expenses in Vietnam. But now France has to spend 1.25 billion U.S. dollars a year in Vietnam. The French economy, which is firmly bound by the war preparation policy and the "dollar loop," can no longer afford it. Therefore, the French government has repeatedly begged the United States to increase aid. Last summer, French Minister of Relations with Associated States of the French Union Letourneau paid a visit to the United States. At a grand banquet in New York, he could not help but say: "I have to ask our American friends, what can they do to save our army from destruction?" Obviously, Mayer's visit to Washington this time was with this state of mind. According to Agence France-Presse, Mayer is prepared to request that the United States provide one billion U.S. dollars in aid to continue the war of aggression against Vietnam and alleviate France's financial crisis. However, Eisenhower, "for his own clear interests," did not readily agree to this aid, which the "United States considers a very large sum," but openly put forward blackmailing conditions. The Associated Press said: "Eisenhower and his aides recognize France's strategic value as an ally and also recognize that France's financial crisis is due to its efforts to expand its military. However, whether the United States has the ability to help depends on whether France can immediately ratify the European Defense (!) Group Treaty. Otherwise, the U.S. Congress will be unwilling to allocate the U.S. dollars that France needs." At the same time, the United States once again indicated to France that France must hand over control of its Vietnamese colonies to the United States before the United States can supply France with a large number of weapons. Recently, U.S. news agencies and the hired pens of monopoly capitalists have been increasingly frequently calling for this demand for the United States to replace France's "divine mission" in Vietnam. An Associated Press reporter, in a news report, seemed to be thoughtfully considering France's situation, saying that France has a heavy burden on its shoulders, on the one hand, it has to wage a war in distant Southeast Asia, and on the other hand, it has to occupy a position in the Western European aggressive bloc. Therefore, "even with the help of the United States, France cannot do well in both aspects." What to do? The U.S. reporter offered France the warning that "a wise man submits to circumstances," praising "French diplomats have often proved themselves to be great realists in the post-war world!" Thus, the U.S. reporter believes that when France formulates new plans for waging the Indochina War, "it will force France to withdraw from Indochina to a greater extent and allow the United States to enter." "France will abandon part of its empire - Indochina, while the United States will use its influence in its traditional way to move Indochina towards greater independence (!)." These are the prices Mayer must pay for requesting the United States to increase aid.

These situations show us a caricatured scene: Mayer, on the one hand, kneels down to the United States to beg for aid, and on the other hand, demands that the United States recognize his "status." What is the result? – In the words of the aforementioned Associated Press reporter – it is precisely "impossible to do well in both aspects." Judging from the Franco-American joint communiqué, Mayer did not get what he mainly asked for – a large amount of U.S. dollars – apart from some pleasant American-style promises. Moreover, as Mayer worried before going to the United States, the United States once again indicated that it would infringe on France's "divine mission." As for Mayer's request that the United States recognize France's "world status," it is even more absurd. What "status" can a vassal state have in front of its master?

However, what makes the French ruling clique even more saddened is that today's France has not only lost its "status as a world power" in front of the United States, but also cannot maintain its "status as a world power" even in front of the defeated country West Germany. In this Franco-American talks, Mayer had to express that he would strive to make France quickly ratify the "European Army" treaty, but deep in his heart was a deep-seated pain, because in France there exists and develops a strong force against the "European Army" - not only the strong French people expressed firm resistance, but also some French bourgeois public opinion is full of doubts and differences. The French ruling class is loyal to implementing the war preparation policy and the anti-Soviet policy; but as the Vice-President of the French National Assembly Palewski said: "Although France and the United States seem to have the same opinions on the Soviet Union issue, this is not the case on the German issue." Some French bourgeois, who had suffered from Germany in the Second World War, could not help but learn from their pain and be wary of the restoration of German aggression forces. Some French bourgeois public opinion believes that if France joins the "European Army," France will "lose its current status as one of the three major Western powers." The worries of this part of the French bourgeoisie are not without reason. In terms of national strength, West Germany has posed a great threat to France. One fact cannot but surprise the French bourgeoisie: last July, West Germany's steel production had surpassed France and Britain and jumped to the first place in Western Europe. In terms of the army, no matter what the "European Army" treaty stipulates, for example, France can send 14 divisions, but at present France only has 12 divisions in Europe. The French press believes that France cannot "ensure a dominant position" in the "European Army," it can only participate in the European Army "at a level lower than the entire European Army." "The French army will be submerged in the European Army." Undoubtedly, West German troops will become the main body of the "European Army." Then what can France use to maintain its "status" in the "European Army"?

The fact that France has been slow to ratify the "European Army" treaty has "delayed the United States' European unification work to the speed of a snail," causing great dissatisfaction in the United States, so the United States used the refusal of large amounts of aid to blackmail France. On the other hand, Adenauer tried to get the West German Bundestag to reluctantly approve the "European Army" treaty. According to the Associated Press, U.S. officials believe that whether France and Germany can ratify the "European Army" is a "true test of their willingness to cooperate with imperialist countries." It can be seen from this that Adenauer, as a servant of the United States, obviously has more "status" than Mayer. But if the French joined the "European Army," they would even more give the position of the United States' first-class servant to West Germany, and demote themselves to second-class servants.

However, the French ruling clique is not willing to completely succumb to the United States, and the contradictions between them are becoming more acute. After the Franco-American talks, France still tirelessly poured the problem of its "divine mission" and "status" into the ears of its American "friends." Recently, "Paris Radical News" wrote on the Vietnam issue: "France believes that Indochina is absolutely within the jurisdiction of France and the member states of the Indochina Federation, because it is the territory of the French Federation. ...France will maintain this attitude today as yesterday, regardless of any criticism." Agence France-Presse insisted on the European Army issue: "If a European group is to be established, and France must participate, the status enjoyed by France is indisputable." Here, anyone can see that the Franco-American talks were absolutely not as Mayer said, full of an "atmosphere of friendship"; when those French and American senior officials in formal attire clinked glasses for their criminal "common cause," the overt and covert struggles between them were even more resounding.

    美国正在损害法国的“天职”和“地位”
    崔奇
    最近法国总理迈耶偕同他的几个部长访问了华盛顿，并就越南战争与“欧洲军”等等问题和美国政府的高级官员们进行了会谈。迈耶赴美之前，曾在蒙特里马发表“重要谈话”说，法国准备为欧洲侵略集团效力，“只要人们承认它的世界强国的地位，只要保证给它执行使命的方法而不否认它的任何天职，也不损害它的法兰西联邦”。合众社报道称：“迈耶去美的目的主要有二，即：以法国迅速批准欧洲军为条件来换取美国对法国国内外更多的援助；并使美国重视法国关于作为世界上一个强国的要求”。为什么迈耶如此念念于法国的“天职”和“地位”呢？这是因为今日的法国统治集团已深深感到，每逢他们和美国打交道时，他们的“天职”就要受到干涉，他们的“地位”就要受到损害。
    在法国统治集团看来，侵略越南，屠杀越南人民，操纵越南保大傀儡，掠夺越南的大米……这是他们的“天职”。然而顽强的现实迫使法国统治集团不得不承认：法国已经没有力量来承担这个“天职”了。法国殖民军在侵略越南的长期战争中，耗去了大量的人力和物力，如今却处于毁灭的边缘。法国“世界报”悲哀地写道：“法国的血液正在枯竭”，法国正在越南“丧失它自己”。法国如果不依赖美国，就无法把这一罪恶的侵略战争进行下去。数年以来，美国一直负担了法国在越南的军费的三分之一。但现在法国在越南每年要消耗十二亿五千万美元，为备战政策和“美元套圈”所牢牢束缚住的法国经济，是更加担负不起了。于是法国政府就三番五次地向美国哀求增加援助。去年夏天，法国联邦成员国关系部部长勒杜尔诺曾到美国走过一遭。他在纽约的一次隆重宴会上，居然情不自禁地说：“我不得不问一问我们的美国朋友们，他们能用什么办法使我们的军队免遭毁灭”。很明显，这回迈耶访问华盛顿，也正是带着这种心情去的。据法新社透露，迈耶准备要求美国能援助十亿美元，以继续进行侵越战争并缓和法国的财政危机。可是，艾森豪威尔“为了自身的明确利益”，并没有轻易地就答应这个“美国认为是很大的数目”的援助，却公开地提出了要挟的条件。合众社说：“艾森豪威尔和他的助手们承认法国作为一个盟国的战略价值，也承认法国的财政危机是由于它努力扩充军备所引起的。但是，美国是否有能力帮助，要看法国是否能立刻批准欧洲防御（！）集团条约而定。否则的话，美国国会将不愿拨出法国所需要的美元”。与此同时，美国再一次向法国表示，法国要把它的越南殖民地的控制权交给美国，美国才能供给法国大量武器。近来，美国通讯社和垄断资本家的雇佣文丐们，越来越频繁地喊叫这种由美国代替法国在越南的“天职”的要求。美联社记者在一则新闻中，仿佛体贴入微地为法国着想，他说，法国一方面要在遥远的东南亚进行战争，另一方面又要在西欧侵略集团中占有地位，这就肩负了重担。因此，“法国即使得到美国的援助，还是不可能两方面都做得好”。怎么办呢？美国记者向法国提出了“识时务者为俊杰”的告诫，他盛赞“法国的外交家经常证明自己是战后世界伟大的现实主义者”！于是这位美国记者相信，法国在拟定关于进行印度支那战争的新计划时，“势将使法国从印度支那在更大的程度上退出来，而使美国进去”。“法国将要放弃它的帝国的一部分——印度支那，同时美国将以它的传统方式施用它的影响，使印度支那走向更大程度的独立（！）”。这些就是迈耶要求美国增加援助的代价。
    这些情况使我们看到了一种漫画式的场面：迈耶一方面向美国下跪乞援，一方面却要求美国承认他的“地位”。结果呢——用上述美联社记者的话来说——正是“不可能两方面都做得好”。从法美会谈公报来看，迈耶除了得到一些悦耳的美国式的诺言外，并没有得到他所要求的主要东西——大量的美元。而且，恰如迈耶在赴美前所担心的一样，美国再次表示要侵犯法国的“天职”。至于迈耶要求美国承认法国的“世界地位”，那就更荒唐了。一个附庸国在它的主子面前能有什么“地位”可言呢？
    然而使法国统治集团感到更大悲哀的是，今日的法国不仅在美国的面前丧失了它的“世界强国的地位”，甚至在战败国西德的面前也不能保持它的“世界强国的地位”了。在这次法美会谈中，迈耶不得不表示他将努力使法国迅速批准“欧洲军”条约，但是在他的内心中却深藏着苦衷，因为在法国存在着和发展着反对“欧洲军”的强大的力量——不但坚强的法国人民表示坚决反抗，就是某些法国资产阶级的舆论也充满着疑虑和分歧。法国统治阶级是忠心执行备战政策和反苏政策的；但是正如法国国民议会副议长巴列夫斯基所说：“虽然法美在苏联问题上似乎已有同样的意见，可是在德国问题上则不然”。在第二次世界大战中吃过德国苦头的某些法国资产阶级，不能不痛定思痛，对德国侵略势力的恢复怀着三分戒心。有些法国资产阶级舆论则认为，如果法国参加了“欧洲军”，法国就“丧失了目前西方三大国之一的地位”。这部分法国资产阶级的忧虑并不是无因的。就国家实力来说，西德已使法国感到莫大威胁。有一件事实不能不使法国资产阶级吃惊：去年七月，西德的钢铁产量已经超过了法国和英国，而跃居西欧第一位。在军队方面，不论“欧洲军”条约作如何的规定，例如法国可以出十四个师，但目前法国在欧洲只有十二个师。法国报刊认为，法国不可能在“欧洲军”中“确保优势地位，它只能保持一种低于整个欧洲军的水平来参加欧洲军”。“法国军队将湮没在欧洲军之中”。无疑地，西德部队将成为“欧洲军”的主体。那末法国到底能用什么来保持它在“欧洲军”中的“地位”呢？
    由于法国迟迟未能批准“欧洲军”条约，使美国的“欧洲统一工作延缓到和蜗牛一样的速度”，引起了美国的极大不满，于是美国就用拒绝大量援助来要挟法国。另一方面，阿登纳却设法使西德联邦议院勉强地批准了“欧洲军”条约。据合众社称，美国官员们认为，法德两国能不能批准“欧洲军”，乃是它们愿意不愿意和帝国主义国家实行“合作的意志的真正考验”。由此可见，作为美国的奴仆来说，阿登纳显然是比迈耶更有“地位”了。可是如果法国人加入了“欧洲军”，那就更将把美国的一流奴仆的地位让给西德，而自己降为二流奴仆了。
    但是法国统治集团并不甘心向美国完全屈服，它们之间的矛盾是更加尖锐了。在法美会谈之后，法国对于它的“天职”和“地位”问题，仍然喋喋不休地往它的美国“朋友”的耳朵里灌送。最近“巴黎急进新闻”，对越南问题写道：“法国认为，印度支那是绝对属于法国和印度支那联邦成员国管辖范围以内的事，因为它是法兰西联邦的领土。……法国今天和昨天一样，将不顾任何批评而维持这种态度。”法新社则对欧洲军问题坚持地写道：“如果要建立一个欧洲集团，而法国又必须要参加的话，法国所享受到的地位是不容争辩的。”在这里，不论是谁都可以看到，法美会谈绝对不像迈耶所说的充满了“友谊气氛”；当那些穿着礼服的法美高级官员们为了他们罪恶的“共同事业”而碰杯的时候，他们之间的明争暗斗是更加铿锵作响了。（附图片）
