Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 5th. The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on its front page on March 30th, praising Korea and China for agreeing to exchange sick and wounded prisoners of war and suggesting the resumption of armistice talks. The editorial criticized the "cautious" and "reserved" attitude of Washington officials towards the proposal to resume peace talks. The editorial said, "When the issue concerns the lives of so many people, there is no room for 'caution' and 'reservations'."

The editorial concluded by calling on every trade union member, every worker, every farmer - every American to write, telegraph, or telephone Eisenhower, Dulles, the US representative to the United Nations, and members of Congress, urging them to accept the proposal put forward by Korea and China to resume armistice talks.

The "Daily Worker" quoted a statement by Thomas Richardson, National Chairman of the American Peace Crusade on March 29th: "If this new proposal becomes a reality, then a major obstacle to a Korean armistice will have been overcome. There is no reason to continue the slaughter in Korea. The war should stop immediately."

The American Peace Crusade is stepping up its efforts to organize delegations to the United Nations and to meet with members of Congress, demanding the resumption of negotiations and an immediate ceasefire. The Peace Crusade urges all sectors of society, workers, churches, youth, women, and farmers' organizations to write letters and telegrams in large numbers to the United Nations, President Eisenhower, and members of Congress, and to send delegations to present them with ceasefire demands.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th. According to a TASS report from Buenos Aires on the 3rd: The Argentine Women's Federation published an open letter to all Argentine women in the Argentine peace supporters' newspaper "For Peace," demanding an end to the Korean War.

The letter to Argentine women stated: "The cruel and inhumane Korean War is about to enter its third year. This war has sacrificed hundreds of thousands of innocent people.

"Incendiary bombs, germ bombs, strafing, the abuse of women and children, the massacre of prisoners of war - this is the fate of the Korean people today. ...There is nothing more terrible than what the Americans are doing in Korea - we fear that this kind of thing will fall on our sons - therefore, we must stop it at all costs."

The Argentine women's movement in support of Korean women and demanding an end to the Korean War has received the support of the entire Argentine people.

　　纽约“工人日报”发表社论
　　号召美国人民为实现朝鲜停战而努力
　　阿根廷妇女联合会要求停止朝鲜战争
    【新华社布拉格五日电】纽约“工人日报”三月三十日以首页刊登社论，赞扬朝鲜和中国同意交换病伤战俘和建议恢复停战谈判。社论指责华盛顿官方对于恢复和平谈判的建议所表示的“小心”和“保留”的态度。社论说，“在问题关系许多人的生命的时候，没有什么‘小心’和‘保留’的余地。”
    社论末后号召每一个工会会员，每一个工人，每一个农民——每一个美国人写信、打电报或打电话给艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯、美国出席联合国代表和国会议员，要求他们接受朝鲜和中国提出的恢复停战谈判的建议。
    “工人日报”引述了三月二十九日美国和平十字军全国主席托马斯·理查逊的声明：“如果这个新的建议成为现实的话，那就克服了朝鲜停战的重要障碍。没有任何理由继续在朝鲜的屠杀。战事应当马上停止”。
    美国和平十字军正在加紧组织代表团前往联合国，往见国会议员们，要求恢复谈判并立刻停战。和平十字军催请社会各界、工人、教会、青年、妇女和农民组织大量地写信，打电报给联合国、艾森豪威尔总统和国会议员，并派出代表团去向他们提出停战要求。
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯三日讯：阿根廷妇女联合会在阿根廷和平拥护者的报纸“争取和平报”上发表告全体阿根廷妇女书，要求停止朝鲜战争。
    告阿根廷妇女书中说：“残酷而不人道的朝鲜战争眼看就快打了三年了。这个战争使数十万无辜的人遭到牺牲。
    “燃烧弹、细菌炸弹、扫射、虐杀妇女与儿童、屠杀战俘——这就是朝鲜人民今日的命运。……没有比美国人在朝鲜的所作所为更可怕的了——我们害怕这种事会落在我们的儿子身上——因此我们无论如何必须制止它。”
    阿根廷妇女声援朝鲜妇女、要求停止朝鲜战争的运动，得到全体阿根廷人民的支持。
