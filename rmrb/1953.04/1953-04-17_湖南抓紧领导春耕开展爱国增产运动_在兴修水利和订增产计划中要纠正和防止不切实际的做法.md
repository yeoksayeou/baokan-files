Hunan Province, on the basis of three years of good harvests, has begun a large-scale spring production campaign in 1953.

The Hunan Provincial People's Government, based on natural conditions and the foundation of work, has selected Liling, Nanxian, and Hengnan counties, which are representative within the province, as demonstration counties for production increase, to establish banners for large-scale production increase. The production increase target for Liling County is 10 percent, Nanxian County is 12 percent, and Hengnan County is 15 to 20 percent. In terms of organizational leadership, the production increase demonstration counties are under the dual leadership of the province and the administrative office (prefecture); each special district controls a production increase demonstration area; and each county controls one to three production increase demonstration townships.

The land reform work in the entire province has basically concluded. The local Party committees have seized the crucial link of "returning to production," and have successively convened cadre meetings to conduct ideological mobilization for leading spring plowing production. They have criticized various erroneous ideas among cadres in the early stages of the land reform's conclusion, such as not being settled in rural work, enabling many cadres to initially recognize the situation of large-scale national economic construction and the important position of agricultural production in national construction. The Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also published an article in its Party journal titled "Gold Star Medal Winner - Ren Guodong," calling on cadres to learn Ren Guodong's working methods.

Some counties in Hunan Province, based on last year's experience, have universally held training classes for production activists. Liling, Nanxian, and Hengnan counties have already trained more than 16,000 people. These backbone elements will become an active force in agricultural production, leading the masses, breaking conservative thinking, promoting advanced experiences, and publicizing production policies. Liling and other counties have also summarized the farming techniques of "deep plowing and close planting, sparse sowing and few seedlings, salt water seed selection, and rational fertilization" based on last year's production increase experiences. Some counties have also paid attention to organizing strong propaganda teams in rural areas and using all forms of propaganda to extensively and deeply publicize the Party and the People's Government's production policies, especially the ten measures on launching the agricultural patriotic production increase movement promulgated by the Central South Administrative Committee, in order to dispel farmers' concerns and unleash the production and labor mutual aid enthusiasm of the vast number of individual farmers, as well as the potential of agricultural production.

Currently, in the leadership of agricultural production, it is necessary to be vigilant and correct the tendency of blind rashness. For example, in water conservancy work, the Shaoyang and Xiangtan special districts in Hunan Province, due to excessively large plans and insufficient preparation, have resulted in wasting manpower and resources, affecting project quality, and causing significant waste of state property. In the water conservancy work in Shaoyang Special District last winter and this spring, a serious accident occurred, resulting in 31 deaths and more than 90 injuries. Also, when calling on farmers to increase production, some cadres are not familiar with the local conditions of manpower and land fertility, and blindly raise production increase targets. Many mutual aid teams and high-yield households in Hunan have already set this year's production plans, but many of these plans are empty. Some are blindly setting excessively high production increase figures at the request of cadres. For example, the Zoushiyin Mutual Aid Team in Liuyang County only had a maximum yield of 1,100 jin per mu in its high-yield fields last year, but this year it plans to produce 2,000 jin per mu. Doing so is harmful and not beneficial. (Our Hunan Reporter Station)

### 湖南抓紧领导春耕开展爱国增产运动  在兴修水利和订增产计划中要纠正和防止不切实际的做法

    湖南抓紧领导春耕开展爱国增产运动
    在兴修水利和订增产计划中要纠正和防止不切实际的做法
    湖南省在三年丰收的基础上，开始了一九五三年春季大生产运动。
    湖南省人民政府根据自然条件及工作基础，选定在省内有代表意义的醴陵、南县、衡南三县为增产示范县，树立大面积增产旗帜。醴陵县的增产要求是百分之十，南县是百分之十二，衡南是百分之十五至二十。在组织领导上，增产示范县受省及行署（专署）双重领导；每专区掌握一个增产示范区；每县掌握一至三个增产示范乡。
    全省土地改革工作已基本结束，各地党委抓住了“归结到生产”这一重要环节，先后召开干部会议进行了领导春耕生产的思想动员，对于土地改革结束初期干部不安心农村工作的各种错误思想进行了批判，使许多干部初步认识到国家大规模经济建设的形势和农业生产在国家建设中的重要位置。中共湘潭地委并在党刊上刊印了“金星奖章获得者——任国栋”一文，号召干部学习任国栋的工作方法。
    湖南省某些县份，根据去年经验，普遍举办了生产积极分子训练班。醴陵、南县、衡南三县已训练了一万六千多名，这些骨干分子将成为农业生产中带动群众，打破保守思想，推广先进经验，宣传生产政策的积极力量。醴陵等县并在去年增产的经验基础上总结了“深耕密植，稀播少插，盐水选种，合理施肥”的耕作技术。部分县还注意了组织农村中壮大的宣传队伍及一切宣传形式大规模地深入地宣传党和人民政府的生产政策，尤其是宣传中南行政委员会所颁布的关于开展农业爱国增产运动的十项措施，以打破农民顾虑，发挥广大个体农民的生产与劳动互助的积极性及农业生产的潜在力量。
    当前在农业生产的领导工作中，必须警惕和纠正盲目冒进的倾向。如在水利工作中，湖南省邵阳、湘潭等专区由于计划过大，准备不足，因而劳民伤财、影响工程质量，造成国家财产的重大浪费。邵阳专区在去冬今春水利工作中，竟酿成死亡三十一人，受伤九十余人的严重事故。又如在号召农民增产时，也有些干部并不熟悉当地的人力、地力情况，盲目地提高增产指标。湖南不少互助组及丰产户已订出今年的生产计划，但很多计划是空洞的，有一些是在干部的要求下盲目地订出过高的增产数字。如浏阳县邹世银互助组去年最高产量的丰产田只一千一百斤，今年就计划每亩产二千斤。这样做是有害无益的。（本报湖南记者站）
