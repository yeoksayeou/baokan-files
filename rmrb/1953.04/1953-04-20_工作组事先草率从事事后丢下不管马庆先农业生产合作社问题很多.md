The work team acted hastily beforehand and abandoned the project afterwards. The Ma Qingxian Agricultural Production Cooperative has many problems.
    The Ma Qingxian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yingmo Village, Zhenlai County, Heilongjiang Province, was established by merging Ma Qingxian's year-round mutual aid team and the labor model Gu Zhenbang's mutual aid team. Both groups had four or five years of mutual aid history and had more leading cadres (the two groups had a total of nine Communist Party members, eight Communist Youth League members, and seven village cadres). The director of the cooperative, Ma Qingxian, was also the secretary of the Party branch. Therefore, the conditions for establishing the cooperative were relatively good. However, because the cadres who helped establish the cooperative acted hastily beforehand and did not carry out sufficient ideological mobilization work, and then abandoned it afterwards, many problems of the cooperative could not be solved, and the spring plowing preparation work could not be carried out.
    At the end of December last year, three cadres from the work team of the Zhenlai County Party Committee went to the village to conduct key pilot work for establishing an agricultural production cooperative. Without fully understanding the ideological situation of the masses beforehand, they convened a meeting of village cadres and said to them: "The purpose of our visit this time is to help you establish a cooperative. It is up to you to decide whether to establish it or not." Some cadres echoed, saying, "Let's establish it!" The next day, they convened a meeting of members of the Ma Qingxian and Gu Zhenbang teams. The cadres of the work team spoke at the meeting about the benefits and nature of the cooperative, and the principles of joining, and then asked everyone to sign up to join the cooperative. The cooperative was thus established. Because it had not undergone sufficient discussion and deliberation, the members joined the cooperative with all sorts of thoughts. Most Party and League members joined in response to the Party's call. Most of the masses joined reluctantly, following the Party and League members. Women thought that joining the cooperative would save them trouble, and they would no longer have to get up early to feed livestock and cook. Others thought that joining the cooperative would mean using machines to farm, and they would be able to reach socialist society before others. In short, everyone's ideological understanding was extremely inconsistent, and all kinds of concerns were not dispelled. After the cooperative was established, the issue of share dividends was not discussed in detail, and the work team mobilized everyone to put their carts and horses into the cooperative. When discussing the issue of carts and horses joining the cooperative, there were disputes within each member's family. Some men were willing to put their carts and horses into the cooperative, but the women were unwilling; cadres were willing to put their carts and horses into the cooperative, but the masses were unwilling. The village chief, Ding Guilin, told the work team that his wife was unwilling to let the carts and horses join the cooperative. Secretary Wang of the work team flew into a rage, saying, "You are the village chief, and you are still half in and half out. How can this cooperative be run well? You think about it." As a result, everyone put their carts and horses into the cooperative in a muddled and reluctant manner. After the carts and horses joined the cooperative, major issues such as the cooperative's management, production plan, labor organization, and labor discipline were not discussed, and the cadres of the work team abandoned it and returned to the county. Now the cooperative's production work is at a standstill. Of the 33 households in the entire cooperative, with more than 50 male and female members, no more than 15 people regularly participate in the cooperative's labor. The phenomenon of idleness, absenteeism, and missed work is extremely serious. The production morale of the members is generally low. Production tools are thrown around everywhere and no one manages them. The horses that joined the cooperative are fed in turns by the members every day, and no one takes good care of them. The masses say: "The cooperative's horses are as thin as dragons." All the material preparations for spring plowing are very poor. There is no hay at all, and there is a shortage of about 20 shi of wheat seeds, grain seeds, and horse feed. The horse grass used for plowing has not been chopped either. The work of promoting the Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience has also become a formality. The cooperative's leading cadres are at a loss to deal with the above problems. Director Ma Qingxian said: "I can't manage it. This large group of people, if I call for the mountain to move, it won't move; if I call for the water to flow, it won't flow. How can I lead them?" Deputy Director Gu Zhenbang said: "Now I am holding a hedgehog in both hands. I can't disperse it, and I can't do anything with it." The leaders of Zhenlai County should immediately start to solve this problem.

    工作组事先草率从事事后丢下不管马庆先农业生产合作社问题很多
    黑龙江省镇赉县英模村马庆先农业生产合作社，是由马庆先常年互助组和劳动模范顾振邦互助组合并建立起来的。这两个组都有了四、五年的互助历史，并有较多的领导骨干（两组共有中共党员九名、青年团员八名、村干部七名），合作社主任马庆先又是党的支部书记。因此，建社条件是较好的。但是，由于帮助建社的干部事先草率从事，没有进行充分的思想发动工作，建社后又扔开不管了，以致这个合作社的许多问题得不到解决，春耕准备工作无法进行。
    去年十二月末，中共镇赉县委工作组的三个干部到该村作建立农业生产合作社的重点试验工作。他们事先没有很好地了解群众的思想情况，就召开了村干部会议，对村干部们说：“我们这次来的目的是给你们建社，建不建你们自己酌量。”部分干部听了，就随声附和地说：“建吧！”第二天就召开了马庆先、顾振邦两组的组员大会。工作组的干部在会上讲了合作社的好处、性质、及入社的原则，就叫大家报名入社。合作社就这样成立起来了。因为没有经过充分讨论酝酿，社员们是抱着各种各样的思想入社的。大部分党、团员入社是为了响应党的号召。大多数群众则是随着党、团员勉强加入了。妇女们认为入了社就省心了，再不用起早爬黑去喂牲口做饭了。还有人认为：入了社就使用机器种地，能比别人先到社会主义社会。总之，大家的思想认识极不一致，各种顾虑都未解除。合作社成立以后，入股分红问题没有详细讨论，工作组就发动大家把车马入到社内。在讨论车马入社问题时，每个社员的家庭内部都有争论。有的男人愿意把车马入社，妇女不愿意；干部愿意把车马入社，群众不愿意。村长丁桂林把他老婆不愿意让车马入社的事向工作组说了，工作组的王秘书大发脾气，他说：“你当村长的还一脚门里一脚门外，这个社怎能办好？你考虑一下吧。”结果，大家都糊糊涂涂、勉勉强强地把车马入了社。车马入社以后，社的经营管理、生产计划、劳动组织、劳动纪律等重大问题都没有讨论，工作组的干部就扔下不管，回县去了。现在社的生产工作处在停顿状况中。全社三十三户，男女社员五十多人，自从建社到现在，经常参加社内劳动的不过十五人。窝工、旷工、误工现象极端严重。社员生产情绪普遍低落。生产工具到处乱扔乱放，没人经管。入社的马每天由社员轮流喂养，谁也不用心好好喂。群众说：“合作社的马瘦的像龙。”春耕的一切物资准备都很差。柴草一点没搂，麦种、谷种和马料共缺二十来石。种地时用的马草也没铡。推行肇源的丰产经验的工作也流于形式了。社的领导干部对上述问题表现得束手无策，主任马庆先说：“我算没法治。这一大堆人，喊山山不动，叫水水不流，怎么领导法呢？”副主任顾振邦说：“现在是双手捧着刺猬，散是散不了，干也干不起。”镇赉县领导方面应立即着手解决这个问题。
