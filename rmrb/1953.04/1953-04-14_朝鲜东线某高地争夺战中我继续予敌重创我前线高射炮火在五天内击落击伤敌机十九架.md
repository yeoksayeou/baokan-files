Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 13th: From the 6th to the 10th, the fighting on the Eastern Front was relatively intense. The battle for a certain high ground northwest of the 883.7-meter high ground near Bianyan-ri on the Eastern Front continues. This battle for the high ground is the most intense battle on the entire front since the end of the battles for Shangfangdong Mountain - "Old Baldy" and other places on the Western Front. Since our army captured this high ground on April 1st, we have maintained control of it. The enemy has launched many counterattacks, but has been unable to recapture the lost position. At the most critical moment of the battle, the enemy broke into a forward position on the southern end of the high ground, but was immediately driven out by our artillery fire and infantry counterattacks. As of the 10th, the enemy had lost more than 1,500 men on this high ground.

On the night of the 6th, our army on the Eastern Front also attacked a high ground east of Yuefei Mountain, south of Gaocheng, annihilating most of a company of the 15th Division of the Li pseudo-army and more than 150 personnel of their artillery and engineering units.

On the night of the 7th, in an attack battle near Jinguli, northwest of Jinhua, our army completely annihilated a platoon of the Belgian Battalion.

In these five days, our army's frontline mobile artillery fire killed or wounded 534 enemy soldiers, and the frontline anti-aircraft artillery fire shot down 4 enemy aircraft and damaged 15 enemy aircraft.

    朝鲜东线某高地争夺战中我继续予敌重创我前线高射炮火在五天内击落击伤敌机十九架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十三日电】六日到十日五天中，东线战斗比较激烈。东线边岩里附近八八三点七高地西北某高地上的争夺战仍在继续进行。这个高地的争夺战，是西线上浦防东山——“老秃山”等地争夺战结束以后全线最激烈的一次战斗。我军在四月一日攻占这个高地以后，一直把它控制在自己的手里。敌人进行了许多次反扑，但是却不能夺回这个丢失的阵地。在战斗最紧急的时候，敌人曾突入到这个高地南端一个前沿阵地上，但马上在我军炮火和步兵的反击下被驱逐出去。到十日为止，敌人已在这座高地上损兵一千五百多人。
    六日深夜，东线我军又袭击高城以南月飞山以东的一个高地，歼灭李伪军第十五师一个连的大部及所属的炮兵、工兵部队等共计一百五十多名。
    七日夜里我军在金化西北金谷里附近的一次袭击战斗中，全歼比利时营一个排。
    在这五天中，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军五百三十四名，前线高射炮火共击落敌机四架，击伤敌机十五架。
