Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: After the statement on the Korean question issued by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our country, Premier Kim Il-sung of Korea, and Foreign Minister Molotov of the Soviet Union, industrial labor models, agricultural labor models, families of volunteers, people in industry and commerce, university professors, and other people from all walks of life across the country expressed their warm support.

Industrial labor models in various regions firmly support the statements of Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov, and believe that this is a test of the US government's sincerity for peace. Liu Yingyuan, a labor model in North China's industry, said: I fully support the statements issued by Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov. If the American imperialists disregard the world's people's desire for peace and dare to prolong the war, our working class will definitely support the Chinese People's Volunteers with all its strength until the American imperialists are willing to stop. Liu Qingxiang, an industrial labor model in Jinan City, believes that these three statements clearly show the unity of the democratic camp. He said: "These statements are a great encouragement to the workers of our Jinan Second Machine Tool Factory. We must resolutely support these just statements with practical actions to guarantee the completion and over-completion of the annual production plan on the basis of over-fulfilling the production plan for the first quarter of this year." Niyazi (Uyghur), a mechanic at the Dihua People's Power Plant with 18 years of work experience, said: "What is said in these three statements is what the people of the world want to say. If the American imperialists have any sincerity in seeking peace, they should immediately accept this suggestion." Lu Agou, an advanced producer and deputy director of Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory, said: "These three statements are a touchstone for the US government's sincerity for peace. If the big bosses in the United States are still unwilling to stop the bloody war, our workers will support the volunteers with greater efforts and give the invading army heavier and greater blows!"

Agricultural labor models in various regions believe that these three statements show the unity of the democratic camp and the determination to strive for peace. Chen Zongfa, a farmer in the suburbs of Xi'an and an expert in wheat yield, said: These statements once again show that our democratic camp's policy of advocating peace and adhering to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is consistent and unwavering. If the US government refuses our fair proposal again, it will be further opposed and despised by the people of the world. Xiang Jinquan, a model of high rice yield in the Southwest region who attended the Vienna World People's Peace Congress in Chongqing, said: "At the World People's Peace Congress, I realized that the unanimous desire of the people of the world is to strive for peace and oppose war. These three statements fully meet the peace requirements of the people of the world. Now it depends on what attitude the US government expresses." Fu Daorong, an agricultural labor model in Wuchang County, Hubei Province, said: "These three statements show the unity of the democratic camp. We have always advocated peace. The struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea is also for peace. We must fight for peace to the end."

Families of volunteers in various regions are deeply concerned about and support our country's and Korea's peace proposals and the Soviet Union's statement. Gou Baochen, a family member of a volunteer in Shenyang, said: The statements of Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov are completely in line with the interests of us relatives whose children are fighting on the Korean front. If the US government has no sincerity for peace, then in order to defend the motherland and maintain world peace, we will better encourage our children to redouble their efforts to strike at the American aggressors. The families of volunteers working in the Anhui Street Sewing Factory in Qiaokou District, Wuhan City, expressed their feelings after reading the three statements published in the newspaper. Wang Yingchen, a family member of a soldier, said: "My son has been in Korea for more than two years, and the government takes good care of our family in the rear. If the US government does not accept this suggestion, I will write to my son and tell him not to come home until he defeats the enemy." Sheng Suhua, a family member of a volunteer in Chongqing, said: Recently, I received a letter from the front line and learned that the volunteers have won another victory. The strength of our Chinese and Korean people is strong, and the democratic camp is united. Our policy of peacefully resolving the Korean issue is also consistent. Premier Zhou's new proposal is another test of whether the US government is willing to make peace.

People in industry and commerce also warmly support the three statements on the Korean armistice issue. Rong Yiren, a Shanghai industrialist and businessman and general manager of Shenxin Textile Company, said: "The statements of Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov demonstrate the determination to guarantee and safeguard peace. At present, the main thing to look at is the sincerity of the United States. If the US government rejects Premier Zhou's new proposal and continues the war in Korea, it will suffer the consequences." Wu Yunxun, an industrialist and businessman, said: "These three statements express the wishes of the people of China and Korea and the peace-loving people of the world. The Korean negotiations have been going on for nearly two years, and peace is now within reach. If the US government still wants to fight in Korea, it will suffer even greater failures!" Huang Changshui, director of the Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "The attention paid to the new proposals of the Chinese and Korean governments and Foreign Minister Molotov's statement around the world proves that this is fully in line with the peace aspirations of the people of the world." After seeing the three statements in the newspaper, people in industry and commerce in Chongqing held a discussion meeting. Everyone unanimously believed that these three statements represent the common will of the people of the world. Hu Ziang, director of the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "These three statements show the unity of the peaceful democratic camp. The industrial and commercial circles in Chongqing have a hundredfold confidence in striving for the complete victory of the cause of peace." Chen Jingshe, Ye Yutian, and Qi Dewang, directors of the Federations of Industry and Commerce in Wuhan, Xi'an, and Yinchuan, also unanimously pointed out: The peaceful democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union is united and incomparably powerful. If the United States does not accept the plan to realize peace and dares to continue to delay and expand the war, it will inevitably be battered and bruised.

University professors, religious circles, and well-known overseas Chinese all stated in their talks that the new proposal put forward by Premier Zhou is the most reasonable way to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Historian and president of Northwest University, Hou Wailu, said: The statement by Premier Zhou and Premier Kim Il-sung on the Korean issue is another great effort made by the people of China and Korea to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue since the outbreak of the American war of aggression. Foreign Minister Molotov's statement fully agreed with this proposal. This proposal is the most reasonable way to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. It not only once again illustrates the sincerity of the Chinese people in safeguarding world peace, but also makes an extremely important contribution to the cause of world peace and security, and has therefore won the warm support of the people of the world. Xu Chongqing, president of Guangzhou Zhongshan University, said: "The statements of Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov once again show that we are willing to make peace and are working together for world peace. Whether the US government accepts the new proposals put forward by the Chinese and Korean sides will be another test it faces before the people of the world." Students at Guangzhou University also held a discussion meeting to discuss these three statements, and all expressed their warm support. Bawuerhan, director of the preparatory committee of the China Islamic Association in Dihua, said: "Peacefully resolving the Korean issue is not only the desire of Chinese Muslims and various ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, but also the desire of all the people in China and the world. The new steps we have proposed for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue should be accepted by the US government. If the US side does not accept this fair and reasonable proposal and still wants to continue and expand the war of aggression, the Chinese Muslims and the people of various ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, together with the people of the whole country, will continue to strengthen their support for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army until the complete victory of the Chinese and Korean people." Yi Meihou, director of the preparatory committee of the Guangzhou Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said: "The statement issued by Foreign Minister Molotov on behalf of the Soviet government is another manifestation of the Soviet Union's policy of peace. The people of the world will further recognize from the statements of the Chinese, Korean, and Soviet governments that the peaceful democratic camp is united and working together to strive for a Korean armistice and world peace!"

    全国各界人民决心用实际行动
    拥护中朝苏三国政府声明
    据新华社讯：我国周恩来总理兼外长、朝鲜金日成首相和苏联莫洛托夫外长发表关于朝鲜问题的声明后，全国各地的工业劳动模范、农业劳动模范、志愿军家属、工商界人士、大学教授和其他各界人士，一致表示热烈拥护。
    各地工业劳动模范们坚决支持周总理、金日成首相和莫洛托夫外长的声明，并认为这是对美国政府有无和平诚意的考验。华北工业劳动模范刘英源说：我完全拥护周总理、金日成首相和莫洛托夫外长所发表的声明。如果美帝国主义不顾全世界人民要求和平的愿望，敢于把战争拖延下去，我国工人阶级一定以一切力量支援中国人民志愿军，一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止。济南市工业劳动模范刘庆祥认为这三个声明明确地表明了民主阵营的团结一致。他说：“这些声明对我们济南第二机器厂工人们是一个很大的鼓舞，我们要坚决以在超额完成今年第一季度的生产计划的基础上，保证完成和超额完成全年的生产计划的实际行动来支持这些公正声明。”有着十八年工龄的迪化人民电厂机务工人尼牙孜（维吾尔族）说：“这三个声明中所说的话，也就是全世界人民心里要说的话，如果美帝国主义还有一点儿谋取和平的诚意的话，就应该立刻接受这个建议。”先进生产者、上海第二纺织机械厂副厂长陆阿狗说：“这三个声明对美国政府有没有和平诚意是一块试金石，如果美国的大老板们还不肯停止流血战争，我们工人将以更大的努力支援志愿军，给予侵略军以更重更大的打击！”
    各地农业劳动模范们认为这三个声明显示了民主阵营的团结一致和争取和平的决心。西安市郊区农民、小麦丰产能手陈宗法表示：这些声明又一次说明了我们民主阵营主张和平和坚持和平解决朝鲜问题的政策是一贯不变的。如果美国政府再要拒绝我们这一公正的建议，一定会更进一步地遭到全世界人民的反对和唾弃。现在重庆、曾出席过维也纳世界人民和平大会的西南区水稻丰产模范向金全说：“在世界人民和平大会上，我体会到全世界人民一致的愿望是争取和平、反对战争。这三个声明完全符合世界人民的和平要求。现在就看美国政府表示什么态度了。”湖北省武昌县农业劳动模范傅道荣说：“这三个声明显示了民主阵营的团结一致。我们是从来主张和平的。抗美援朝斗争也是为了和平。我们要为和平奋斗到底。”
    各地志愿军家属深切关心和拥护我国和朝鲜的和平建议以及苏联的声明。沈阳市志愿军家属勾宝臣说：周总理、金日成首相和莫洛托夫外长的声明，是完全符合于我们有子弟在朝鲜前线作战的亲人们的利益的。如果美国政府没有和平诚意，那么为了保卫祖国，为了维护世界和平，我们将更好地鼓励我们的儿女更加倍地打击美国侵略者。在武汉市礄口区安徽街缝纫工厂中工作的志愿军家属们，在读了报上登载的三个声明后，都发表了感想。军属王英臣说：“我儿子在朝鲜两年多了，我们家属在后方，政府照顾我们很好。美国政府要不接受这个建议，我就写信给我的儿子，叫他不打败敌人不回家。”重庆市的志愿军家属盛素华说：最近我收到前方的来信，知道志愿军又打了胜仗。我们中朝两国人民的力量是强大的，民主阵营是团结一致的。我们和平解决朝鲜问题的政策也是一贯的。周总理的新建议是对于美国政府是否愿意和平的又一次考验。
    工商界人士对于朝鲜停战问题的三个声明也都热烈拥护。上海工商业家、申新纺织公司总经理荣毅仁说：“周总理、金日成首相和莫洛托夫外长的声明，说明对保障和保卫和平的决心。目前主要看美国的诚意如何，如果美国政府竟然拒绝周总理新的建议，在朝鲜继续进行战争，那就要自食其恶果。”工商业家吴蕴初说：“这三个声明表示了中朝两国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的愿望。朝鲜谈判已进行近两年了，今天和平垂手可得，如果美国政府仍想在朝鲜打下去，那一定会遭受更大的失败！”广州市工商业联合会主任委员黄长水说：“从中朝政府的新建议和莫洛托夫外长声明在全世界所引起的重视，就证明这是完全符合全世界人民的和平愿望的。”重庆市工商界人士在报上看到三个声明后，举行了讨论会。大家一致认为这三个声明是代表全世界人民共同意志的。重庆市工商业联合会主任委员胡子昂说：“这三个声明说明和平民主阵营的团结一致。重庆市工商业界更加有千百倍的信心来争取和平事业的完全胜利。”武汉、西安、银川市工商业联合会主任委员陈经畬、叶雨田和祁德望也一致指出：以苏联为首的和平民主阵营是团结无间的，强大无比的。美国如不接受实现和平的方案仍敢继续拖延和扩大战争，必然要碰得头破血流。
    大学教授、宗教界和华侨著名人士在谈话中都一致表示周总理提出的新建议是和平解决朝鲜问题的最合理的办法。历史学家、西北大学校长侯外卢说：周总理和金日成首相对朝鲜问题的声明，是中朝两国人民在美国侵略战争发生以来为谋取和平解决朝鲜问题所作的又一次巨大的努力。莫洛托夫外长的声明完全赞同这个建议。这个建议是和平解决朝鲜问题的最合理的办法。它不仅再次说明了中国人民对于保卫世界和平的诚意，而且是对于世界和平安全事业作了极重要的贡献，因而取得了全世界人民的热烈支持。广州中山大学校长许崇清说：“周总理、金日成首相和莫洛托夫外长的声明，再一次显示了我们愿意和平，并正在为世界和平而共同努力。美国政府是否接受中朝方面提出的新建议将是它在全世界人民面前所受的又一次考验。”广州大学的学生还举行了座谈会，讨论这三个声明，都一致表示热烈拥护。现在迪化的中国伊斯兰教协会筹备委员会主任鲍尔汉说：“和平解决朝鲜问题，不仅是中国穆斯林们和新疆各少数民族的愿望，而且也是全中国、全世界人民的愿望。为了和平解决朝鲜问题，我方所提出的新的步骤，美国政府是应该接受的。如果美方不接受这一公平合理的建议，还想继续和扩大侵略战争，中国的穆斯林们和新疆各少数民族人民与全国人民将继续加强支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，直打到中朝人民完全胜利为止。”广州市归国华侨联谊会筹备会主任蚁美厚说：“莫洛托夫外长代表苏联政府发表的声明，是苏联和平政策的再次体现。全世界人民将会从中朝苏三国政府的声明中进一步认识到：和平民主阵营正团结一致，共同争取朝鲜停战和世界和平！”
