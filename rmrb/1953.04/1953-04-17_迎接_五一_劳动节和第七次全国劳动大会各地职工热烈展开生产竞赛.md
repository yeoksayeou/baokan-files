    [By our reporter] To greet the "May Day" International Labor Day and the Seventh National Labor Congress, workers across the country are launching production competitions with unparalleled labor enthusiasm.

    Many factory workers have successively and enthusiastically launched production competitions. On April 10th, the workers of Tangshan Power Plant issued a challenge to all electrical workers in the North China region, initiating a comprehensive inter-factory competition. The National Committee of the China Electrical Workers' Union has issued instructions to carry out this movement, calling on the union's organizations at all levels, under the unified leadership of the Party and in close coordination with the administration and the Communist Youth League, to organize mutual competitions between shifts, groups, and workshops in a prepared and planned manner. The main content of the competition focuses on consolidating safety, eliminating all accidents of all sizes, and completing the production plan, ensuring that Red May is a "safe and accident-free month." In Shenyang, 110,000 workers from 94 state-owned factories and enterprises have participated in the patriotic production competition to greet the "May Day" International Labor Day and the Seventh National Labor Congress. During the competition, workers have put forward specific guarantees for improving production, addressing current production problems.

    While carrying out production competitions, many factory workers are seriously discussing the April and second quarter production plans to greet "May Day" International Labor Day and the Seventh National Labor Congress. When discussing the plan, the workers of Chongqing State-owned No. 101 Steel Plant seriously proposed specific methods to complete the plan and formulated a patriotic production pact. When discussing the April production plan, the workers of State-owned No. 601 Cotton Mill focused on discussing the poor product quality in the first quarter and formulated a plan to complete the April output and quality targets. Workers at the Shanghai State-owned Qiujiang Machine Factory have enthusiastically discussed and revised the April production plan. The factory leadership is also preparing to further strengthen the planning and organization of production to improve production management and ensure the completion of the April production tasks. Shenyang No. 53 Factory and Huanggu Tun Railway Factory have put forward competitive conditions to ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion of the national plan for the first half of the year.

    Since the launch of production competitions by workers in various factories and mines, preliminary results have been achieved. After launching a production competition in March, the workers and staff of Chongqing State-owned No. 201 Factory not only made up for the production tasks that were not completed in January and February, but also completed the overall production task for the first quarter one and a half days ahead of schedule. Fu Wenchang, an old worker at the No. 53 Factory who makes tool samples, improved his operating methods in the competition and created a new record of making a tool sample in 46 minutes. The workers of the seventh group of the third workshop improved the equipment, reducing the scrap rate by 80 percent.

    【本报讯】全国各地职工，正以无比的劳动热情，来迎接“五一”国际劳动节和第七次全国劳动大会。
    许多工厂职工，相继热烈展开了生产竞赛。唐山发电厂职工四月十日向华北全区电业职工发出挑战书，发起全面的厂际竞赛。中国电业工会全国委员会已发出开展这一运动的指示，号召电业工会的各级组织，要在党的统一领导下，密切配合行政和青年团，有准备、有计划地组织班、组、车间的相互竞赛。竞赛的主要内容以巩固安全、消灭一切大小事故和完成生产计划为中心，确保红五月为“安全无事故月”。沈阳市已有九十四个国营工厂、企业单位的十一万职工参加迎接“五一”国际劳动节和第七次全国劳动大会的爱国主义生产竞赛。在竞赛中，职工们都针对目前生产中的问题，提出了提高生产的具体保证。
    许多工厂职工在开展生产竞赛同时，认真讨论四月份和第二季度生产计划，迎接“五一”国际劳动节和第七次全国劳动大会。重庆市国营一零一钢铁厂职工在讨论计划时，认真提出了完成计划的具体办法，并订出了爱国生产公约。国营六零一纱厂职工在讨论四月份生产计划时，着重讨论了该厂第一季度产品质量低劣的问题，并订出了完成四月份产量质量的计划。上海国营虬江机器厂职工已热烈地讨论和修订了四月份的生产计划。厂的领导方面也准备进一步加强生产的计划性和组织性来改进生产管理，以保证四月份生产任务的完成。沈阳五三工厂和皇姑屯铁路工厂提出了保证全面地均衡地完成上半年国家计划的竞赛条件。
    各厂矿职工开展生产竞赛以来，已经取得了初步成绩。重庆市国营二零一工厂的工人职员，三月份开展生产竞赛后，不但补上了一、二月份没有完成的生产任务，并提前一天半完成了第一季度总的生产任务。五三工厂做工具样板的老工人傅文昌，在竞赛中改进了操作方法，创造了四十六分钟做一个工具样板的新纪录。第三车间第七小组的工人改善了设备，使废品率降低了百分之八十。
