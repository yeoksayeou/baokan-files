Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: Since Eisenhower refused to revoke the death sentence against the Rosenbergs, a movement protesting the Eisenhower government's deliberate plot to murder the Rosenbergs has unfolded in various European countries. People unanimously demand that American executioners be stopped from harming innocent people through a criminal plan and that the Rosenbergs be immediately restored to freedom.

    In the German Democratic Republic, the German Democratic Renewal League's Council of Culture, representing 200,000 German cultural figures, sent a telegram to Eisenhower stating: "Hundreds of millions of people in countries around the world, as well as the American people, believe that the Rosenberg's verdict lacks factual and rational basis. Carrying out this verdict amounts to legal murder." On March 27th, cultural workers in the German Democratic Republic held a rally at the Berlin Press Building in response to the movement to save the Rosenbergs. Prominent writer Bredel said at the meeting: "The fascist judges in the United States are attempting to strike a blow against the world's peace movement by killing this pair of peace fighters. However, the protest movement against this terrible verdict is constantly rising and clearly demonstrates the strength of the peace camp, which will ultimately prevail." The meeting passed a resolution to send a telegram to the U.S. President demanding the immediate release of the Rosenbergs. The president of the Leipzig District Court, Glass, wrote a letter to U.S. Federal Judge Kaufman stating: "World-renowned lawyers, including British Royal Legal Advisor Pritt, have carefully studied this case and have concluded that the Rosenbergs are innocent. Therefore, this case must be retried immediately."
    The Bulgarian Association of Scientific Workers held a rally on the evening of March 30th in Sofia to defend the Rosenbergs. Participants included academicians of the Academy of Sciences, corresponding academicians, professors from various colleges, writers, workers, and staff of government organs. Many prominent Bulgarian scientists spoke at the meeting, expressing protest against the Eisenhower government's criminal behavior. Participants at the rally sent a protest telegram to the U.S. government demanding the immediate release of the Rosenbergs.
    People in Western European countries are also protesting the "Rosenberg Case." Women in Duisburg, West Germany, held a rally to protest the Eisenhower government's planned murder of the innocent Rosenbergs. Many prominent figures in France have written to the judges of the U.S. Supreme Court, demanding the revocation of the unreasonable verdict against the Rosenbergs in the name of humanity and justice. People throughout Italy have expressed deep sympathy for the Rosenbergs, to the point that even right-wing newspapers have had to call for the original verdict to be overturned. In Belgium, six hundred Young Pioneer members wrote letters to the Rosenbergs' children, expressing the hope of all Belgian children that the Rosenbergs would regain their freedom, and expressing respect to the Rosenbergs' two children for having such heroic parents who fought for peace. In some towns in Switzerland, residents have posted slogans on the walls demanding "Save the Rosenbergs."
    Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: New York News: The Rosenbergs, currently held in Sing Sing Prison, filed another appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on the 30th.

    欧洲各国人民要求恢复罗森堡夫妇自由
    罗森堡夫妇再度向美国最高法院上诉
    【新华社三十一日讯】自从艾森豪威尔拒绝撤销对罗森堡夫妇的死刑判决以来，抗议艾森豪威尔政府蓄意谋害罗森堡夫妇的运动在欧洲各国展开，人民一致要求制止美国刽子手残害无辜的罪恶计划，立即恢复罗森堡夫妇的自由。
    在德意志民主共和国，文化界德国民主复兴联合会理事会曾代表二十万德国文化界人士打电报给艾森豪威尔说：“世界各国亿万人民和美国人民同样地认为：对罗森堡夫妇的判决是没有事实和合理的根据的。执行这个判决等于法律上的谋杀。”在三月二十七日，民主德国的文化工作者在柏林新闻大厦举行了一次响应拯救罗森堡夫妇运动的集会。著名作家布莱德尔在会上说：“美国的法西斯法官企图用杀害这一对和平战士的方法来打击全世界的和平运动。但是，反对这个可怕的判决的抗议运动正在不断高涨，并且清楚地显出了终将获得胜利的和平阵营的力量。”会议通过了一项决议，决定打电报给美国总统要求立即释放罗森堡夫妇。来比锡地方法院院长格拉斯写信给美国联邦法官考夫曼说：“全世界著名的律师，包括英国皇室法律顾问普里特在内，曾经仔细地研究过这个案件，并且得出罗森堡夫妇无罪的结论。因此必须立即重审这个案件。”
    保加利亚科学工作者协会三月三十日晚上在索非亚举行了保卫罗森堡夫妇的大会。参加的人有科学院院士、通讯院士、各学院的教授、作家、工人和机关工作人员。保加利亚许多著名的科学家在会上发言，对艾森豪威尔政府的罪恶行为表示抗议。参加大会的人向美国政府发出抗议电，要求立即释放罗森堡夫妇。
    西欧各国人民也抗议“罗森堡夫妇案件”。西德杜伊斯堡的妇女曾举行了一次大会，抗议艾森豪威尔政府有计划地谋害无辜的罗森堡夫妇。法国的许多著名人士已经写信给美国最高法院的法官，以人道与正义的名义要求撤销对罗森堡夫妇的无理判决。意大利各地人民都对罗森堡夫妇表示深厚的同情，以至右翼报纸也不得不要求撤销原判。在比利时，六百个少年先锋队队员写信给罗森堡的孩子，表达了比利时全体儿童盼望罗森堡夫妇重获自由的心愿，并且对罗森堡的两个孩子有这样英勇的为和平而战斗的父母表示敬意。在瑞士的一些城镇里，居民在墙上贴上标语，要求“拯救罗森堡夫妇”。
    【新华社三十一日讯】纽约消息：目前在新新监狱的罗森堡夫妇在三十日已再度向美国最高法院提出上诉。
