Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League
Calls on Rural Youth League Members to Strive for Spring Planting and a Bumper Harvest
The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League calls on rural Youth League members nationwide to strive for spring planting and a bumper harvest. The full text of the call is as follows: Rural young men and women League members across the country!

The 1953 spring planting season has arrived.

The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued instructions stipulating that spring planting production is the overriding central task in rural areas; calling on everyone to launch a patriotic production increase movement to strive for a bumper harvest this year, so as to ensure the needs of the people's food and industrial development, and to make the country's Five-Year Plan economic construction a success from the very first year.

Comrades! Take action! Respond enthusiastically to the call of the Party Central Committee and stand at the forefront of the production front! Fight to realize the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee!

As you engage in the intense spring planting production movement, the Central Committee of the Youth League hopes that you can publicize the Party's policies to the broad masses of rural people, mobilize everyone to implement the Party's policies, and do the following four things based on the Party Central Committee's instruction of March 16th.

The first thing is: Concentrate efforts and do a good job in production.

We know that every extra ounce of effort put in by everyone means more harvest, more construction power for the country, and a better life for us; if we want to actively participate in national construction and support the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, we must participate in productive labor with practical actions. Therefore, during the spring planting season, all rural young men and women League members must concentrate their efforts and make doing a good job in production their primary task. All our other activities must be arranged and carried out around and in conjunction with spring planting production. Anything that can be reduced should be reduced as much as possible, and anything that can be postponed should be postponed, so as not to hinder rural production and cause dissatisfaction among the masses. The Party Central Committee has already instructed all localities to pay strict attention to this issue. If some places still do not pay attention or do not pay enough attention, you must actively reflect your opinions and resolutely correct them. In short, every Youth League member must ensure that they do not miss the farming season and must be a good example of hard work, production, and love for the motherland.

The second thing is: Publicize policies and implement policies.

It is very valuable that our Youth League members work hard in spring planting and take the lead in participating in production mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and this enthusiasm and enterprising spirit should be continued. However, in order to do a good job in production, enthusiasm and willingness to work hard are not enough; we must study the Party's policies, publicize the Party's policies to the masses, and strictly act in accordance with the Party's policies. On the one hand, we must publicize the policy of protecting farmers' land property, encourage everyone to let go and produce, and dispel the concerns of some people who are "afraid of standing out" and "afraid of being collectivized"; we must publicize the policy of mutual aid and cooperation so that everyone understands that mutual aid and cooperation are the only way to enrich farmers' lives and rise together, and voluntarily organize. On the other hand, we must always remember that the general production conditions in rural areas are still relatively scattered and backward. Whether it is promoting an advanced production experience or mobilizing everyone to organize and participate in mutual aid teams and cooperatives, we must start from this actual situation and the specific conditions that can be achieved. We must discuss everything with everyone and guide everyone to advance step by step. We must never be ambitious, impatient, or rash; we must never force orders or be divorced from the masses. Only in this way can we avoid turning good things into bad things and truly ensure that not only everyone increases production but also that everyone's political level is improved. At the same time, we must not only unite the farmers who have already joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations to do a good job in production, but also enthusiastically care for and help individual farmers to do a good job in production, so as to better strengthen the connection between our Youth League and the broad masses and further organize everyone to participate in the regular patriotic production increase movement.

The third thing is: Help military families and overcome difficulties.

The good days of the Chinese people are inseparable from the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They are the people our youth most respect. In order to enable them to fight and defend the country at the front with peace of mind, our Youth League members should, together with the people of the whole country, always care for the families of martyrs and military personnel, and conscientiously assume the glorious task of helping the families of martyrs and military personnel to do a good job in production and overcome difficulties, so that they do not leave land uncultivated or reduce production. In areas where there are still disasters, the masses face many difficulties in carrying out spring planting. Some people have little confidence in production. Our Youth League members should take the lead in discussing with everyone ways to ensure both surviving the famine and production, boost the masses' production enthusiasm, and strive to overcome the disaster.

The fourth thing is: Learn skills and improve abilities.

We young people have plenty of strength, but our abilities are not as good as others. However, abilities can be learned. We must sincerely learn from our elders who know how to produce and honestly learn from labor models. An excellent Youth League member must also be a capable person on the production front. Leading by example while learning from others is the true color of our Youth League members.

Comrades! Thousands upon thousands of heroic model figures have emerged in our country. On the agricultural front, our Youth League has also produced many labor models, such as comrades Jin Xiulan, Chen Yike, Song Kejun, Guo Yulan, and so on. We hope that all labor models will maintain their glory, not be arrogant, humbly learn, unite the masses, and strive for greater achievements. We also hope that more model figures will continue to emerge in this year's patriotic production increase movement.

Dear comrades! In order to win the great victory of building our motherland, in order to strive for a bumper harvest through hard spring planting, let us advance under the glorious banner of Mao Zedong!
April 3, 1953

    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
    号召农村青年团员努力春耕生产争取丰收
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会号召全国农村青年团员努力春耕生产争取丰收。号召全文如下：全国农村男女青年团员们！
    一九五三年的春耕季节到来了。
    中国共产党中央委员会已经发布了指示，规定了春耕生产是农村中压倒一切的中心工作；号召大家展开爱国增产运动，争取今年丰收，这样来保证人民食用和工业发展的需要，使国家五年计划经济建设，头一年就搞得很好。
    同志们！行动起来！热烈响应党中央的号召，站到生产战线的最前列！为实现毛主席和党中央的号召而斗争！
    在你们投入紧张的春耕生产运动时，青年团中央委员会希望你们能够向广大的农村群众宣传党的政策，动员大家来执行党的政策，并根据党中央三月十六日的指示做到下面四件事情。
    第一件是：集中力量，搞好生产。
    我们知道，每个人多出一分气力，生产就多一分收成，国家就增加一分建设力量，我们的生活就会更好起来；我们要积极参加祖国建设，支援抗美援朝斗争，就要在实际行动上努力参加生产劳动。因此，在春耕季节，全体农村男女青年团员们，必须集中力量，以搞好生产为首要任务。我们的其他一切活动，都要围绕并结合春耕生产来布置和进行，凡可以减少的就尽量减少，凡可以推迟的就往后推迟，以免妨碍了农村生产，引起群众不满。党中央已经要各地严格注意这个问题。如果有的地方还不注意或注意得不够，你们就要积极反映意见，切实纠正。总之，我们每个青年团员一定要保证不误农时，一定要做一个努力生产、热爱祖国的好榜样。
    第二件是：宣传政策，执行政策。
    我们青年团员在春耕中努力劳动，带头参加生产互助合作组织，这种热情和进取心是很宝贵的，应当继续发扬的。但是，为了搞好生产，单凭热情和积极肯干还不够，一定要学习党的政策，向群众宣传党的政策，并且要严格按照党的政策办事。一方面，我们要宣传保护农民的土地财产的政策，鼓励大家放手生产，去掉有些人“怕冒尖”、“怕归公”的顾虑；要宣传互助合作的政策，使大家懂得互助合作是使农民生活富裕、共同上升的必经的道路，而自愿地组织起来。另一方面，我们又要时刻记住目前农村中一般的生产条件还比较分散落后，不论是推广一种先进生产经验，或是动员大家组织和参加互助组、合作社，都必须从这个实际情况与可能办到的具体条件出发，凡事多和大家商量，引导大家逐步前进。千万不能好高骛远、急躁冒进；千万不能强迫命令、脱离群众。只有这样，我们才不会把好事办成坏事，才能真正做到不但使大家都增加生产，而且使大家的政治水平提高。同时，我们不仅要团结已参加互助合作组织的农民共同搞好生产，还应该热情地关心和帮助单干农民搞好生产，以便更好地密切我们青年团和广大群众的联系，进一步组织大家投入经常的爱国增产运动。
    第三件是：帮助军属，克服困难。
    全中国人民的好日子是与光荣的中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军分不开的，他们是我们青年最敬爱的人。为了使他们安心在前方作战和保卫国防，我们青年团员应该和全国人民一起，随时关怀烈属、军属，切实担当起帮助烈属、军属搞好生产、克服困难的光荣任务，使他们不荒地，不减产。在目前还有灾荒的地区，群众进行春耕的困难很多，有些群众对生产信心不大，我们青年团员就要带头和大家商量度荒与生产两不误的办法，鼓舞群众的生产情绪，努力战胜灾荒。
    第四件是：学习技术，提高本领。
    我们青年人，力气有的是，就是本事还不如人，但是，本事是可以学到的，我们一定要诚诚恳恳地向会生产的长辈学习，老老实实地向劳动模范学习。优秀的青年团员，必须同时是生产战线上的能手。一面带头干，一面跟人学，这就是我们青年团员的本色。
    同志们！我们祖国已经出现了千千万万的英雄模范人物。在农业战线上，我们青年团也已经出现了许许多多的劳动模范，例如金秀兰、陈翊科、宋克俊、郭玉兰等等同志。我们希望所有的劳动模范都保持光荣，不要骄傲，虚心学习，团结群众，争取更大的成绩。我们还希望在今年爱国增产运动中继续出现更多的模范人物。
    亲爱的同志们！为了争取建设祖国的伟大胜利，为了努力春耕争取丰收，让我们在光辉的毛泽东的旗帜下，努力前进！
                            一九五三年四月三日
