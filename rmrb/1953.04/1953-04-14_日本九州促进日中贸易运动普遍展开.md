Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Japanese industrialists and businessmen, wandering and distressed under the "embargo" policy, are increasingly strongly demanding to find a way out from trade with China.

Since the signing of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement in China by Mrs. Kora Tomi and others in June 1952, small and medium-sized enterprises in Kyushu, which were severely harmed by the "embargo" policy, were greatly encouraged and immediately launched a movement to promote Sino-Japanese trade. Under the influence of this movement, the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly, the center of Kyushu industry, submitted a proposal to the Yoshida government regarding "promoting Sino-Japanese trade." More than fifty prefectural assembly members from Fukuoka Prefecture, including assembly members from the Liberal Party to the left-wing Socialist Party and non-affiliated members, jointly initiated the establishment of the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly Members League for the Promotion of Sino-Japanese Trade, calling on assembly members from various prefectures in Kyushu to establish the Kyushu Local Assembly Members League for the Promotion of Sino-Japanese Trade.

At present, almost all prefectures in Kyushu have established local Sino-Japanese trade promotion conferences. In order to unify the movement to promote Sino-Japanese trade in various prefectures of Kyushu, further advance this movement, and establish the Kyushu Sino-Japanese Trade Promotion Conference, with Tsutomu Egashira, director of Kyowa Bussan Co., Ltd., as chairman.

    日本九州促进日中贸易运动普遍展开
    【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：在“禁运”政策下彷徨苦闷的日本工商业越来越强烈地要求从对中国的贸易中找寻出路。
    自从一九五二年六月高良富夫人等在中国签订中日贸易协议之后，受“禁运”政策严重危害的九州中、小企业得到很大鼓舞，立刻就展开了促进日中贸易的运动。在这个运动的影响之下，九州工业的中心——福冈县的县议会向吉田政府提出了“关于促进日中贸易”的建议书。福冈县的五十多个县议员，包括从自由党到左派社会党和无党派的县议员并发起成立了日中贸易促进福冈县议员联盟，号召九州各县的议员成立九州的日中贸易促进地方议员联盟。
    现在九州各县差不多都成立了地方性的日中贸易促进会议。它们为了统一九州各县的促进日中贸易运动，进一步把这个运动推向前进，并成立了九州日中贸易促进会议，由协和物产股份有限公司董事江头敏担任主席。
