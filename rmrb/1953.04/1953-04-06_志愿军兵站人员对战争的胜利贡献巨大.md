Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 2nd: The station personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army actively worked on the Korean battlefield, overcoming many difficulties, properly storing and hiding millions of tons of complex materials sent by the people of the motherland, and promptly supplying the needs of the front line, which played an important guaranteeing role in the victory of the front-line operations.

The Volunteer Army's station is mainly composed of warehouse keepers and loading and unloading troops. When a large number of munitions and supplies are transported by trains and trucks to the material handover point, the loading and unloading troops work day and night to carry the materials into the warehouse for storage; when the front line needs them, they load the materials from the warehouse onto trucks and transport them to the front. They scientifically organize manpower and continuously improve loading and unloading efficiency. The first and fifth squads of the seventh loading and unloading company of a certain station only took thirteen minutes to unload thirty tons of materials from two freight cars. The seventh company once unloaded more than 7,000 barrels of soybean oil in fifty minutes, and they did so gently and lightly, without losing a drop of oil. The loading speed of the loading and unloading workers was even faster. They used only one minute for five people to fill a truck with materials. Their slogan is: "Load quickly, unload quickly, hide quickly, don't waste a minute!"

The work of the loading and unloading soldiers is arduous and intense. On cold snowy nights, sweat and snow mixed together, and the wet clothes, blown by the cold wind, froze hard, stinging the skin like knives. Once, Xi Zhong, the company commander of the eighth loading and unloading company of a certain station, led the soldiers to unload a train all night, and after dawn, they received the task of rescuing materials being rained on in a gully. They worked in the heavy rain mixed with snowflakes until dark. In the evening, as they were walking back to rest, they suddenly discovered that a sudden surge of water was impacting the materials hidden in another gully. They forgot the cold and fatigue and jumped into the waist-deep ice water to rescue the materials.

In order to prevent the materials transported from the motherland from being lost, the warehouse keepers made strict camouflage of the warehouses and the materials placed in the open air. In order to prevent the materials from mildewing or becoming ineffective, they were carefully inspected every day, and the materials were dried every half month or month. Due to their high sense of political responsibility, the loss rate of materials was greatly reduced. The staff of a warehouse did not lose any materials in seventeen months; the six keepers of a military depot kept 120 freight cars of materials, and they created a record of not losing or damaging a single bullet or shell in a year, which was praised by the front-line soldiers.

In this arduous and intense work, many warehouse keepers have gloriously made meritorious service. Wang Shiming, a model Communist Party member and keeper of a certain warehouse, was responsible for receiving twelve train cars of grain one night last spring. He covered all the grain with tarpaulins. In the middle of the night, a strong wind suddenly blew up, and he was awakened and immediately got up to organize people to check the grain piles. In the strong wind, they covered the grain piles with tarpaulins and firmly pressed them with stones to prevent the grain from being lost. Last summer, he used his nap time every day to pour the last bit of gasoline left in the empty gasoline drums together under the hot sun. He cleaned a total of more than 500 gasoline drums and poured out more than 50 kilograms of gasoline. He had such a high sense of responsibility for the materials transported from the motherland, and thus he gloriously won a second-class merit.

    志愿军兵站人员对战争的胜利贡献巨大
    【新华社朝鲜前线二日电】中国人民志愿军中的兵站工作人员，在朝鲜战地积极工作，战胜了许多困难，将祖国人民送来的千百万吨种类复杂的物资妥善地保管和隐藏起来，及时地供应了前线的需要，对于前线作战的胜利，起了重要的保证作用。
    志愿军的兵站主要是由仓库保管人员和装卸部队所组成的。当大量的军火物资由火车和汽车运到物资交接点时，装卸部队就彻夜地进行着紧张的搬运，把物资搬进仓库保存起来；在前线需要的时候，他们又将仓库里的物资装上汽车运向前方。他们科学地组织人力，不断地提高装卸效率。某兵站装卸第七连的第一班和第五班，只用十三分钟就搬卸了两个车皮上的三十吨重的物资。第七连有一次用五十分钟就卸了七千多桶豆油，而且轻装轻卸，没有损失一滴油。装卸工作人员们装车的速度更快，他们以五个人仅用一分钟时间就装满一辆汽车的物资。他们的口号是：“快装、快卸、快隐藏，不准浪费一分钟！”
    装卸部队战士们的工作是艰苦、紧张的。在寒冷的雪夜里汗水和雪水流在一起，湿衣服被寒风一吹，冻得冰硬，像刀子一样地刺疼着皮肤。有一次，某兵站装卸第八连连长席忠率领着战士们卸了一夜车，天明后又接受任务去抢救在山沟里被雨淋着的物资。他们冒着夹杂着雪花的大雨一直干到天黑。晚上，他们正走回去休息，忽然又发现突涨的流水正冲击着隐藏在另一山沟里的物资，他们忘记了寒冷和疲劳，又跳进齐腰的冰水里，把物资抢出来。
    仓库保管工作人员为了使祖国运来的物资不受损失，把仓库和在露天空地上放着的物资都作了严密的伪装。为了不使物资霉烂或失效，每天都进行仔细检查，并且每隔半月或一月就要将物资晾晒一次。由于他们高度的政治责任心，物资的耗损率就大为降低。某仓库的工作人员在十七个月中没有损失一点物资；某军械库的六个保管员保管着一百二十个车皮的物资，他们创造了一年没有损失或损坏一发子弹炮弹的纪录，受到了前线战士们的赞扬。
    在这艰苦而紧张的工作中，有许多仓库保管员都光荣地立了功。某仓库的保管员、模范共产党员汪世明，在去年春天的一个晚上，负责接收了十二个火车皮的粮食。他把粮食全部用雨布盖好。半夜中突然刮起狂风，他被惊醒后，立即起来组织人员去检查粮食堆。他们在狂风中给粮食堆盖好雨布又用石块把它牢牢地压住，使粮食避免了损失。去年夏天，他每天利用午睡时间，在炎热的太阳下把空汽油桶里剩下的一点一滴汽油倒在一起，一共清理了五百多个汽油桶，倒出了五十多斤汽油。他对祖国运来的物资有着这样高度的责任心，因而光荣地立了一次二等功。
