The entire patriotic peasantry of Korea, for the final victory of the Fatherland Liberation War, actively responded to the call of their beloved leader, Premier Kim Il-sung, to "do everything for the victory of the war," and launched a campaign to increase production of grain to supply the front and rear areas with more food. At the same time, with boundless enthusiasm, they engaged in supporting the front lines by repairing railways, bridges, and highways, transporting military supplies, transporting the wounded, donating weapons, and helping military families, to ensure the victory of the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

The patriotic Korean farmers who are struggling to increase grain production face many difficulties. The American aggressors, in order to achieve their aggressive goals, exhausted all malicious and brutal means during the war. After suffering heavy defeats on the front lines, they carried out frenzied bombing of our rear areas, massacring countless farmers, destroying many farmhouses, grains, seeds, farm tools, and livestock. Especially during the period when the enemy invaded the northern half of the Republic, the enemy thoroughly destroyed the various achievements that farmers had obtained under the leadership of the Workers' Party and the Republic government after liberation, and many patriotic farmers were killed and taken away, and the countryside was looted. The enemy dropped large quantities of poison gas bombs and bacteriological bombs on our front and rear areas, attempting to exterminate our people. The enemy dropped many bombs in the fields, destroying many water conservancy and irrigation facilities, attempting to destroy our agricultural production. In addition, Korean farmers also suffered from severe floods and droughts and other natural disasters in 1951, as well as difficulties such as insufficient manpower and lack of seeds and fertilizers due to many young people going to the front lines. However, for the unity, independence, and freedom of the fatherland, all Korean farmers, under the call of their beloved leader, Premier Kim Il-sung, bravely overcame numerous difficulties and launched a wartime grain production increase campaign. The Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government took various measures to help farmers overcome difficulties and provided them with encouragement in all aspects. In order to take care of the farmers who suffered from the war, the Republic government made a series of effective decisions, such as the decision to stabilize the people's lives, the decision to lend grain to disaster-stricken farmers to ensure production, the decision to exempt some spring crop public grain in 1952, and the decision to implement crop planting countermeasures in 1951 and 1952. These decisions were aimed at stabilizing the lives of farmers and strengthening the people's animosity and confidence in victory.

In order to solve the farmers' housing problem, the Republic government provided free timber for building houses; for farmers who lacked food, food was allocated; for farmers who lacked seeds, they were lent or exchanged for seeds cultivated by state farms. In order to solve the shortage of animal power, the Republic government adjusted the draught animals of provinces, cities, counties, townships, and villages, and lent farmers funds to purchase cattle. Funds were allocated from the state treasury for the construction of irrigation facilities and reservoirs. Due to the repair and expansion of farm tool factories, in 1951 alone, more than 81,900 iron plows, more than 67,000 hoes, and more than 357,000 various farm tools were produced and supplied to farmers. The repaired state-owned agricultural machinery tillage stations helped farmers cultivate their land. In addition, the government widely mobilized the staff of state organs and people's organizations, the workers of factories and enterprises, and the troops stationed in various places to help farmers with cultivation.

The strong support of the people of fraternal countries for the struggling Korean people is also a great encouragement to the farmers. In the spring of 1952, when there was a serious spring famine due to the enemy's occupation, looting, and burning, as well as the floods throughout Korea, the great Marshal Stalin deeply sympathized with the suffering of the Korean people and sent 50,000 tons of flour. The Chinese brothers under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong often assisted us with grain. This gave great help and encouragement to all Korean farmers and further strengthened their fighting will.

All farmers put forward the slogan "Planting is fighting," and regardless of the enemy's frenzied bombing, they overcame all difficulties, completed sowing well, actively carried out fertilization, weeding, and pest control, and achieved good harvests. They also braved the danger of enemy planes bombing and strafing under the slogan of "No waste of an inch of land," filling in bomb craters in the fields for sowing. Some even sowed seeds in the middle of collapsed earthen walls. They also used moonlit nights to carry out spring plowing, autumn harvesting, and threshing.

Farmers in Yongchang Village, Kyongsong County, North Hamgyong Province, bravely removed 390-odd landmines buried by the enemy when they fled, and completed sowing. Farmers in Changyon County, Hwanghae Province, in May 1951, under the harassment of American pirates, cultivated 3,793 cho of cultivated land, completing 100% of the original production plan. Farmers in the front-line area of Kangwon Province, under intense artillery fire, adhered to their land and heroically completed the sowing of more than 5,000 cho. Such examples are countless in the countryside of the Republic.

Women in the Republic's countryside, especially the family members of martyrs and soldiers who sent their husbands and sons to the front lines, have become the strong masters of the rear. They bravely overcame the difficulties of insufficient manpower, animal power, and chemical fertilizers, and actively carried out the wartime grain production increase campaign. In the countryside of the northern half of the Republic, there have been hundreds of thousands of women engaged in cultivation; many advanced women farmers who are good at mastering farming techniques have emerged, and they have all achieved great achievements in creating new records. Yu Wanyu, from Sinchon County, Hwanghae Province, whose husband and ten family members were killed by the enemy during the enemy's occupation, transformed her grief and indignation into strength, and cultivated more than 5,000 pyong of rice fields alone, achieving a yield of 9 tons and 100 kilograms of rice per cho. Kim Yeon-soo, from Pyongwon County, South Pyongan Province, replaced her husband who went to the front, and cultivated 9,000 pyong of land alone for three years, achieving an excellent yield of 10 tons of rice per cho. She also introduced her experience to the farmers in the village, enabling 12 households in the village to achieve the same bumper harvest. The number of women production experts in the countryside is increasing: more than 5,000 production experts have emerged in Hwanghae Province; 3,653 in North Pyongan Province; and 2,693 in South Pyongan Province.

In the difficult war environment, in order to produce more grain, the farmers worked hard to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, and developed the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance. Farmers helped each other to solve the difficulties of lacking food, clothing, housing, and utensils, and also helped each other to solve the shortage of seeds, draught animals, farm tools, and manpower. They all worked for a common goal: to strive to exert all their strength to increase production. In 1951, in the four provinces of South Pyongan, Hwanghae, Kangwon, and South Hamgyong alone, farmers exchanged 5,817 tons of grain, solving the difficulty of seed shortage; during the spring plowing season, counties exchanged more than 7,900 heads of draught animals, ensuring the smooth progress of cultivation.

The Chinese People's Volunteers comrades who shed blood and fought on the Korean front for the freedom, independence, and unity of the Korean people, in order to help the Korean farmers struggling with difficulties, launched a campaign to save grain and sent a large amount of grain to the Korean farmers. They also used the gaps between battles or after work to help the family members of martyrs and soldiers and other farmers with insufficient manpower to carry out spring plowing, weeding, harvesting, and threshing. This noble quality of the Chinese People's Volunteers commanders and fighters and their love for the Korean people has further consolidated the friendship and unity between the two peoples of China and Korea.

In the fierce struggle for wartime grain production increase, every corner of the Republic is using advanced farming methods and new agricultural technologies for production, and a mass production increase campaign has been launched throughout the country. In 1952, there were many lectures and training courses on advanced farming techniques in the northern half. More than 1.2 million farmers participated in the study. The "small-plant dense planting transplanting method" advocated by the state is generally implemented in more than 90% of the cultivated areas. In addition, advanced seedling raising methods such as cold bed seedling raising, warm bed seedling raising, and land bed seedling raising are also widely promoted everywhere. In spreading advanced experience, high-yield farmers play a great role. Lin Guangxie, a farmer from Dingzhou County, North Pyongan Province, introduced his high-yield experience to the farmers in the whole village and helped them, resulting in an average yield of 8 tons and 124 kilograms of grain per cho for 15 households in the whole village.

Various places have adopted advanced high-yield experiences, resulting in many moving high-yield figures and deeds. Due to the launch of mass high-yield competitions, many areas have broken the highest production records of the past and created new records. Kim Dae-sik, a farmer from Dingzhou County, North Pyongan Province, produced 9 tons and 793 kilograms of rice in 1,486 pyong of rice fields in 1952, achieving an excellent yield of 19 tons and 800 kilograms per cho. Yoon Si-hwa, a farmer from Myongchon County, North Hamgyong Province, produced 17 tons and 100 kilograms of rice per cho in 1,500 pyong of rice fields, setting a new record for North Hamgyong Province. Song Hwa-sil, a farmer from Huaiyang County, Kangwon Province, produced 4 tons and 409 kilograms of corn in 1,400 pyong of corn fields, setting a new record of 9 tons and 180 kilograms per cho. Kim Chang-man, a farmer from Pungsan County, South Hamgyong Province, produced 72 tons of potatoes per cho from 500 pyong of potato fields, setting a new record.

In order to supply more grain to the front and rear areas, the Republic's farmers have indomitably come up with many ways to actively increase production, so that the total sown area in 1952 exceeded the original plan by 102.7%; the grain harvest exceeded 113% of that in 1951, and increased by 130,000 tons compared with 1948, the highest production year in the Republic, greatly exceeding the highest pre-war level.

The farmers of the Republic, not only in the victorious struggle to increase grain production, but also in the work of supporting the front lines, have dedicated everything they have and demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and internationalism.

In order to make their soldiers stronger, the farmers generously donated funds to purchase weapons such as airplanes, tanks, and warships. In June 1951, the farmers of Sinchon County, Hwanghae Province, donated 1,200 bags of rice that they had increased production and saved. Subsequently, the farmers in the entire northern half of the area donated 168,420 bags of grain, more than 33,460 pieces of cloth, and other large amounts of property.

In the winter of 1952, the high-yield farmers launched a widespread movement to "donate rice to support the front lines." On November 4 last year, Shin Won-seop and other eight high-yield farmers from Tongdeok Village, Pyongwon County, South Pyongan Province, voluntarily took out 50 bags of rice from their surplus grain as rice to support the front lines. Subsequently, high-yield farmers from various places responded and set off a donation craze, forming a great patriotic movement. Our beloved leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, personally wrote letters to every patriotic high-yield farmer who donated rice to support the front lines, expressing his congratulations.

The farmers who love the motherland have demonstrated unlimited dedication and actively supported the People's Army and the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers who are defending our motherland's land with their blood. Farmers near the front line, braving intense artillery fire, transported ammunition and grain to the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, helped them build fortifications, and escorted the wounded. They also organized people's self-defense forces to prevent spies and traitors and to be vigilant against the enemy's landing conspiracy.

In the winter of 1951, in the Nanjang area of the eastern front, our army was engaged in a battle with the enemy. Farmers in Goseong County, Kangwon Province, regardless of men, women, old, and young, braved heavy snow and artillery fire to transport ammunition and grain to the People's Army for 40 consecutive days until the People's Army warriors drove back the enemy. After that, in order to produce more grain for the People's Army, they threw themselves into the struggle to increase grain production, regardless of fatigue.

In the autumn of 1952, when the enemy launched the so-called "Kimhwa Offensive," the farmers in the areas near the front line such as Huaiyang, Kimhwa, and Pyonggang all devoted themselves to supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers warriors who were defending our motherland's land with their blood. The farmers transported ammunition and grain for the Volunteer brothers, and sent them firewood and charcoal, organized large numbers of stretcher teams, transported the wounded, and ensured the victory of the front line.

The farmers also actively repaired the railways, highways, and bridges damaged by enemy planes, so that military equipment and military supplies could be quickly transported to the front line. They wrote many letters of condolence to encourage the soldiers to fight bravely; and they came up with various ways to help the families of martyrs and soldiers.

All patriotic farmers of the Republic, in order to make the American and British imperialist aggressors suffer a complete defeat, and to gloriously defend the freedom, independence, and unity of their beloved motherland, are dedicating all their strength, overcoming all difficulties to support the front lines; at the same time, making the consolidated rear a solid copper wall and iron fortress.

Note: One cho is one cho step, equivalent to 16.5 mu in China. 3,000 pyong is equal to one cho.

    朝鲜农民增产粮食与支援前线的斗争
    朝鲜劳动新闻社文化部部长  李文商
    全体朝鲜爱国农民，为了祖国解放战争的最后胜利，积极响应自己敬爱的领袖金日成首相的“一切为了战争的胜利”的号召，展开了为供应前方和后方更多粮食的增产运动。同时，他们以无限的热情从事修复铁路、桥梁和公路、运送军需物资、运回伤员、捐献武器、帮助军属等支援前线的工作，以保证人民军和中国人民志愿军的作战胜利。
    在为增产粮食而斗争的朝鲜爱国农民的面前是存在着许许多多困难的。美国侵略者为了达到其侵略的目的，在战争中用尽了一切恶毒的残暴手段。他们在前线遭到了惨重的失败以后，便向我们的后方进行狂轰滥炸，屠杀了无数农民，毁坏了许多农家、粮食、种籽、农具和家畜。尤其是在敌人侵入共和国北半部地区那个时期，敌人把农民解放后在劳动党和共和国政府的领导下所获得的各种成就彻底加以破坏，许多爱国农民并被杀害和抓走，农村被掠夺一空。敌人在我们的前线和后方，投掷了大量的毒气弹和细菌弹，企图消灭我们的人民。敌人在田地里投下许多炸弹，破坏了许多水利灌溉设施，企图摧毁我们的农业生产。除此以外，朝鲜农民在一九五一年还遭受了严重的洪水和天旱等自然灾害，以及由于许多青年走上前线而造成的人力不足和种籽肥料缺乏等困难。但是，为了祖国的统一、独立和自由，全体朝鲜农民在自己敬爱的领袖金日成首相的号召下，勇敢地克服了重重困难，展开战时增产粮食的斗争。朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府采取了各种措施帮助农民克服困难，在各方面给予他们以鼓励。共和国政府为了照顾遭受战争灾害的农民，曾作出一系列有效的决定，如：为安定人民生活的决定、贷予受灾农民粮食以保证生产的决定、免除一九五二年度部分春季农作物公粮的决定、以及一九五一年和一九五二年实行农作物播种对策的决定等。这些决定就是为了安定农民的生活，加强人民的敌忾和胜利的信心。
    共和国政府为了解决农民的居住问题，免费供应建筑房屋的木料；对缺粮的农民，配给粮食；对缺少种籽的农民，贷给他们或者和他们交换国家农场培育的种籽。共和国政府为了解决畜力不足，调整了道、市、郡、面、里的耕畜，并贷给农民款项购买耕牛。为了修复灌溉设施和蓄水池，由国库拨出经费施工。由于修复和增建了农具工厂，仅在一九五一年就生产了八万一千九百余具铁犁、六万七千余把锄头和三十五万七千余件各种农具供应农民。由于修复了国营农业器械代耕所，从而帮助了农民耕作。此外，政府还广泛地动员了国家机关和人民团体的工作人员、工厂企业的工人、驻在各地的部队，帮助农民进行耕种。
    各兄弟国家的人民对斗争中的朝鲜人民的大力支援，也是对农民一个极大的鼓舞力量。一九五二年春天，由于敌人的侵占、掠夺和烧毁以及朝鲜全境的水灾而造成严重的春荒的时候，伟大的斯大林大元帅深深体念着朝鲜人民的苦难，送来了五万吨面粉。在毛泽东主席领导下的中国兄弟们经常援助我们粮食。这都给予全体朝鲜农民以极大的帮助和鼓舞，更加加强了他们的斗争意志。
    全体农民提出“播种就是战斗”的口号，不顾敌人的疯狂轰炸，战胜了一切困难，很好地完成了播种，并积极进行施肥、锄草和除虫，获得了很好的收成。他们并在“不荒废一寸土地”的口号下，冒着敌机轰炸扫射的危险，填平田地里的炸弹坑进行播种。有的甚至在坍塌了的土墙中间也撒下了种籽。他们并利用月夜进行春耕、秋收、打场等劳作。
    咸镜北道镜城郡永昌里农民，勇敢地拔除了敌人逃走时埋在稻田里的三百九十几颗地雷，完成了播种。黄海道长渊郡农民一九五一年五月在美国海盗骚扰下，还耕种了三千七百九十三町耕种面积，百分之百地完成了原订的生产计划。江原道前线一带的农民，在炽烈的炮火下，一直坚守着自己的土地，英勇地完成了五千余町的播种工作。像这样的事例，在共和国的农村中是数不胜数的。
    共和国农村中的妇女，特别是把自己的丈夫和儿子送上前线的烈属军属，成了后方坚强的主人翁。她们勇敢地克服了人力、畜力和化学肥料不足的困难，积极进行着战时粮食增产的运动。在共和国北半部的农村中，出现了从未有过的几十万名妇女在从事耕作；出现了许多能够善于掌握耕种技术的先进妇女农民，她们都获得了创造新纪录的巨大成就。在敌人侵占时期曾被敌人杀害了丈夫和家属十人的黄海道信川郡的俞万玉，把满腔的悲愤化成力量，一个人耕种了五千余坪稻田，获得了一町生产九吨零一百公斤稻子的成绩。平安南道平原郡的金莲寿，代替了到前方去的丈夫，在三年当中，一个人耕种了九千坪土地，获得了一町生产十吨稻子的优良成绩。她并把自己的经验介绍给村里的农民，使得该村十二户农民每户都能获得同样的丰收。在农村中妇女生产能手日益增多：黄海道涌现了五千多名生产能手；平安北道有三千六百五十三名；平安南道有两千六百九十三名。
    在艰难的战争环境中，农民们为了更多地生产粮食，努力克服了一切困难和障碍，并发挥了友爱互助的精神。农民们互相帮助解决粮食、衣服、房屋和用具欠缺的困难，也互相帮助解决种籽、耕畜、农具和人力的不足。他们都是为了一个共同的目标，就是：努力发挥一切力量增加生产。一九五一年，仅平安南道、黄海道、江原道和咸镜南道四个道，农民们就交换了五千八百一十七吨粮食，解决了种籽缺乏的困难；在春耕播种期间，郡与郡间交换使用了耕畜七千九百多头，保证了耕种工作的顺利进行。
    为了朝鲜人民的自由、独立和统一而在朝鲜前线流血战斗的中国人民志愿军同志们，为了帮助与困难作斗争的朝鲜农民，展开了节约粮食运动，将大量的粮食送给朝鲜农民。他们并利用战斗空隙或工作余暇，帮助军属烈属和其他人力不足的农民进行春耕、锄草、收割和打场。中国人民志愿军指战员们这种高贵的品质和对朝鲜人民的热爱，使得朝中两国人民之间的友谊与团结更加巩固了。
    在为战时增产粮食的激烈斗争中，共和国的每个角落都在利用先进的耕作方法和新农业技术进行生产，在全国范围内展开了群众性的增产运动。一九五二年，北半部有许多讲授先进耕作技术的讲习会和传习会。参加学习的农民有一百二十多万人。国家提倡的“小株密植插秧法”，在百分之九十以上的耕种地区普遍实施着。此外，先进的冷床育苗、温床育苗、陆床育苗等育苗法也到处广泛地推行。在传播先进经验方面，丰产的农民起着很大的作用。平安北道定州郡农民林光燮，把自己的丰产经验介绍给全村的农民，并对他们进行了帮助，结果使全村十五户平均每町丰产粮食八吨零一百二十四公斤。
    各地采取了先进丰产经验，产生了许多动人的丰产人物和事迹。由于展开了群众性的丰产竞赛，有很多地区打破了过去生产的最高纪录，而创造新的纪录。平安北道定州郡农民金大植，一九五二年在一千四百八十六坪稻田中生产出九吨七百九十三公斤稻子，获得了每町十九吨零八百公斤的优良成绩。咸镜北道明川郡农民尹时和，在一千五百坪稻田中生产出合每町十七吨零一百公斤的稻子，创造了咸镜北道的新纪录。江原道淮阳郡农民宋和实，在一千四百坪玉米田里生产出四吨四百零九公斤玉米，创造了每町九吨零一百八十公斤的新纪录。咸镜南道丰山郡农民金昌满，从五百坪马铃薯田里生产出合每町七十二吨的马铃薯，创造了新纪录。
    共和国的农民们，为了要供给前线和后方更多的粮食，不屈不挠地想出许多办法积极增产，使得一九五二年播种总面积超过了原定计划百分之一百零二点七；谷物收获量比一九五一年超过了百分之一百一十三，比共和国生产量最高的一九四八年增加了十三万吨，大大超过了战前的最高水平。
    共和国的农民不仅在增产粮食的胜利斗争中，并且在支援前线工作中，献出了自己的一切，发挥了高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神。
    农民们为了要使自己的子弟兵更加强大，他们毫不吝惜地踊跃捐献款项以购买飞机、坦克和军舰等武器。一九五一年六月，黄海道信川郡农民们把自己增产和节约下来的一千二百袋稻子捐献出来。随着，全北半部地区的农民们捐献了十六万八千四百二十袋粮食、三万三千四百六十多匹布和其它大量财物。
    一九五二年冬，丰产农民又掀起了广泛的“捐献支援前线米”运动。去年十一月四日，平安南道平原郡通德里申元燮等八个丰产农民，自愿从自己的余粮中拿出稻子五十袋作为支援前线米。接着，各地的丰产农民纷纷响应，掀起了捐献热潮，形成一个伟大的爱国运动。我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅曾亲自写信给每一位捐献支援前线米的爱国丰产农民，表示祝贺。
    热爱祖国的农民，发挥了无限的献身精神，积极支援以鲜血保卫我们祖国土地的人民军和兄弟的中国人民志愿军。前线附近的农民，冒着激烈的炮火，替人民军和中国人民志愿军运送弹药和粮食，帮助他们构筑工事，护送伤员。而且还组织了人民自卫队，防奸防特和警惕着敌人的登陆阴谋。
    一九五一年冬，在东部战线南江一带，我军正与敌军进行着争夺战。江原道固城郡农民不分男女老幼，冒着大雪和炮火，给人民军运送弹药和粮食继续四十天之久，一直到人民军勇士们把敌人打退。以后，他们为了更多地打粮食送给人民军，不顾疲劳，又投入了增产粮食的斗争中。
    一九五二年秋，正是敌人发动所谓“金化攻势”的时候。淮阳、金化和平康等前线附近地区的农民，都投入了支援以鲜血保卫我们祖国土地的中国人民志愿军勇士们的战斗。农民们替志愿军兄弟们运送弹药和粮食，并给他们送去木柴和炭火，组织了大批担架队，运送伤员，保证了前线的胜利。
    农民们并积极修复被敌机炸坏的铁路、公路和桥梁，使军需器材和军用物资迅速地运到前线去。他们写了许多慰问信，鼓励战士们英勇作战；并想出各种各样的办法帮助军烈属。
    共和国全体爱国农民，为了使美英帝国主义侵略者遭到彻底的失败，光荣地保卫自己亲爱的祖国的自由、独立和统一，正献出自己的全部力量，克服
    一切困难支援前线；同时，使巩固的后方成为坚固的铜墙铁壁。
        注：一町即一町步，合我国十六亩半。三千坪等于
        一町。
