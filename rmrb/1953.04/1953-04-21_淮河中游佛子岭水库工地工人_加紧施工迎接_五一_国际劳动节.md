According to Xinhua News Agency: The 17,000 workers and laborers at the Foziling Reservoir construction site in the middle reaches of the Huai River are speeding up construction in a fighting posture to greet the "May 1st" Labor Day. At present, the height of the buttresses of a reinforced concrete continuous arch dam built on the reservoir has reached 30 meters above the ground. The entire concrete pouring project has been 20 percent completed.

The main project of the Foziling Reservoir is the construction of a reinforced concrete continuous arch dam. The construction procedure of the entire project is divided into two stages: the first stage is to build a semi-circular earth enclosure dam on the west bank of the Pi River, so that the western half of the continuous arch dam project can be completed first within the enclosure dam. The second stage is to build an earth enclosure dam on the east bank of the Pi River to complete the eastern half of the continuous arch dam project. According to the original construction schedule, the closure work of the enclosure dam on the east bank of the Pi River should be completed in mid-May. Now, more than 17,000 workers and laborers on the construction site have set off a wave of intense construction to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day. Workers of the drilling team have actively studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the working methods of the Ma Wenzhi drilling team in Northeast China, and have created two new records successively. Workers from the British-affiliated Jiangnan Shipyard who rushed to the Huai River harnessing construction site from Shanghai have generally completed the gate installation ahead of schedule.

    加紧施工迎接“五一”国际劳动节
    据新华社讯：淮河中游佛子岭水库工地上的一万七千名工人、民工，正以战斗姿态加紧施工，迎接“五一”劳动节。现在，水库上修建的一座钢筋混凝土连拱坝，坝垛的高度已高出地面三十公尺。全部浇筑混凝土工程已完成百分之二十。
    佛子岭水库的主要工程，是建造钢筋混凝土的连拱坝。整个工程的施工程序分为两个阶段：第一阶段是在淠河西岸筑一半圆形的土围坝，以便在围坝之内先做好连拱坝西半部的工程。第二阶段是在淠河东岸筑土围坝，做连拱坝东半部的工程。按原定施工进度，五月中旬就要做好淠河东岸围坝合龙工作。现在工地上的一万七千多名工人、民工，为迎接“五一”劳动节，掀起了紧张施工的热潮。钻探队的工人，积极学习了苏联先进经验和东北马文志钻探小组的工作方法，已先后创造了两次新纪录。从上海赶到治淮工地的英联造船厂的工人，在安装闸门中，普遍按预定进度提前完成。
