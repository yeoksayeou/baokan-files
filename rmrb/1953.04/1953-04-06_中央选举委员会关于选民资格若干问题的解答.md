    Central Election Committee Answers Several Questions Regarding Voter Eligibility
    April 3, 1953

    1. Who has the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: The election law stipulates that "All citizens of the People's Republic of China who have reached the age of eighteen have the right to elect and to be elected, regardless of their nationality or race, gender, occupation, social origin, religious belief, education level, property status, and length of residence." That is to say: All people of the People's Republic of China who enjoy political rights and are eighteen years of age or older, regardless of their nationality, race, gender, occupation, class origin, religious belief, whether they have attended school or what school they attended, whether they have property or how much property they have, and the length of time they have resided in the local area, all have the right to elect and to be elected. Such a provision in the election law precisely illustrates the democratic and broad nature of our electoral system.

    2. Do foreigners residing in our country have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: Foreigners residing in our country who have not obtained citizenship of the People's Republic of China do not have the right to elect and to be elected. Those who have obtained citizenship of the People's Republic of China and possess the qualifications of a citizen, and are eighteen years of age or older, have the right to elect and to be elected.

    3. Who are the members of the landlord class?
    Answer: Members of the landlord class are those who occupy land, do not labor themselves, or only do incidental labor, and live by exploitation. In landlord families, those who do not rely on land exploitation as their primary source of livelihood, but engage in other occupations, or those who participate in agricultural labor year-round and are not in a dominant position in the landlord family, and the children of landlords who were under the age of eighteen at the time of land reform and have not yet become the actual decision-makers in the landlord family, are all of landlord class origin, but not members of the landlord class. Enlightened gentry, i.e., certain individuals within the landlord class who opposed Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule and imperialist aggression, actively supported the people's democratic cause, and endorsed the people's democratic dictatorship and land reform, are not considered members of the landlord class.

    4. How can members of the landlord class change their status and obtain the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: After the completion of land reform, if members of the landlord class completely obey government decrees, diligently engage in labor production or other business operations, have no reactionary behavior whatsoever, and continue to do so for more than five years, they should be granted the right to elect and to be elected after changing their landlord status through legal procedures.

    If members of the landlord class are unable to participate in labor due to loss of labor ability and rely on their children or other income for their livelihood, and completely obey government decrees after the completion of land reform, with no reactionary behavior whatsoever, for a continuous period of five years or more, they should be granted the right to elect and to be elected after changing their landlord status through legal procedures.

    Even if members of the landlord class have completed five years after land reform, if they do not diligently engage in labor production or other business operations, or have any reactionary behavior, or violate the decrees of the People's Government, their status should still not be changed, and their right to elect and to be elected should continue to be deprived.

    The above-mentioned "continuous five years or more" should be calculated from the date when the land reform was completed in the township where the landlord class member is located, i.e., the date when the land was distributed.

    5. Do those who are both landlords and other components, or other components and landlords, have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: Landlords who are also other components, i.e., those who rely on land exploitation as their primary source of livelihood, should be considered members of the landlord class and have no right to elect and to be elected before they legally change their landlord status.

    Other components who are also landlords, i.e., those who rely on other occupational labor as their primary source of livelihood, should be treated according to their other component status after the completion of land reform and have the right to elect and to be elected. For those who both occupy and rent out a large amount of land and engage in other occupational labor, their class component is determined by the method by which they obtain their primary source of livelihood: If they are landlords, they are landlords; if they are capitalists, they are capitalists; if they are freelancers, they are freelancers, etc. Those who are landlords are considered members of the landlord class and have no right to elect and to be elected; those who are capitalists or freelancers are considered capitalists or freelancers and have the right to elect and to be elected.

    6. After the completion of land reform, if members of the landlord class engage in industry and commerce, or work in factories or mines, or engage in other occupational labor, do they have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: After the completion of land reform, whether members of the landlord class engage in industry and commerce, work in factories or mines, or engage in other occupational labor, they generally must do so for more than five years before their status should be changed and they should be granted the right to elect and to be elected. However, if they are particularly active in labor production, consistently abide by government decrees, and have made significant progress, their status can be changed and they can be granted the right to elect and to be elected through legal procedures, even if they have not completed five years.

    7. If members of the landlord class are family members of revolutionary martyrs or soldiers, do they have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: If members of the landlord class are family members of revolutionary martyrs or soldiers and have not completed five years after land reform, they generally do not have the right to elect and to be elected. However, if they are politically active and follow legal procedures, they can be granted the right to elect and to be elected.

    8. If women from landlord families marry workers, peasants, or poor people, or men from landlord families marry into workers', peasants', or poor people's families, or children from landlord families are adopted by workers, peasants, or poor people, do they have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: Regardless of whether it was before or after liberation, women from landlord families who marry workers, peasants, or poor people have the right to elect and to be elected if they were not the actual decision-makers in their landlord family at the time of their marriage. If they were the actual decision-makers in their landlord family at the time of their marriage, and engage in labor for a year or more as their primary source of livelihood after their marriage, they are recognized as workers, peasants, or poor people and have the right to elect and to be elected. The same applies to men from landlord families who marry into workers', peasants', or poor people's families, or children from landlord families who are adopted by workers, peasants, or poor people.

    9. If women from workers', peasants', or poor people's families marry landlords, or men from workers', peasants', or poor people's families marry into or are sold into landlord families, or children from workers', peasants', or poor people's families are adopted by landlords, do they have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: Before liberation, if women from workers', peasants', or poor people's families married landlords, if their lives were not the same as the landlords, but the same as the workers, peasants, or poor people (i.e., relying on their own labor as their primary source of livelihood), or lived the same life for less than three years, their original component remains unchanged and they have the right to elect and to be elected. After liberation, the original component of women from workers', peasants', or poor people's families who married landlords does not change, and they have the right to elect and to be elected.

    Before and after liberation, the same applies to men from workers', peasants', or poor people's families who married into or whose children were sold to landlords before liberation. Before liberation, if children from workers', peasants', or poor people's families were adopted by landlords, if they lived the same life as their adoptive parents for less than five years, or their lives were not the same as their adoptive parents, but the same as their biological parents, their original component remains unchanged and they have the right to elect and to be elected.

    10. Do rich peasants have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: Rich peasants should have the right to elect and to be elected.

    Old rich peasant elements in old liberated areas should be granted the right to elect and to be elected if, after the completion of land reform, according to the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the division of rural class components, they completely obey government decrees, diligently engage in labor production or other business operations, and have no reactionary behavior whatsoever for a continuous period of three years or more.

    11. Are counter-revolutionaries who have been legally arrested, sentenced to imprisonment, or declared under surveillance deprived of their right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: According to Article 7 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The People's Republic of China must suppress all counter-revolutionary activities and severely punish all Kuomintang counter-revolutionary war criminals and other incorrigible counter-revolutionary ringleaders who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause. For general reactionaries, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists, after disarming them and eliminating their special forces, their political rights must still be deprived according to law for a necessary period of time." Therefore, counter-revolutionaries who have been legally arrested, sentenced to imprisonment, declared under surveillance, or determined by the People's Government to have their political rights deprived at present should all be deprived of their right to elect and to be elected.

    12. After counter-revolutionary criminals have been released or their surveillance has been lifted, do they have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: After counter-revolutionary criminals have been released after serving their full term of imprisonment, they still do not have the right to elect and to be elected before the legally announced period of deprivation of political rights has expired. After the surveillance of counter-revolutionary criminals has been lifted, the election committee or the people's court should determine whether they have the right to elect based on the severity of their crimes, the degree of their reform, and the opinions of the people.

    Counter-revolutionary criminals who have been released or had their surveillance lifted should still be deprived of their right to elect and to be elected if they also have the status of a landlord and have not legally changed their landlord status.

    Those who should not have been put under surveillance but were wrongly put under surveillance should have their surveillance lifted immediately and their electoral rights restored.

    13. Do the families of counter-revolutionaries have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: According to Article 9 of the Interim Measures for the Supervision of Counter-Revolutionaries: "The supervision of counter-revolutionaries is limited to themselves and shall not involve their families, relatives, or friends." Therefore, family members of counter-revolutionaries who have not participated in the conspiracy of counter-revolutionary activities should have the right to elect and to be elected.

    14. What are "others who are legally deprived of political rights"?
    Answer: Others who are legally deprived of political rights refer to other general criminal offenders other than members of the landlord class and counter-revolutionaries who are legally deprived of political rights, who have been declared by the people's judicial organs to be deprived of their political rights.

    15. Do those who are detained, both convicted and awaiting trial, have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: All convicted persons in detention (including in prisons, labor reform teams, and detention centers, etc.) who have been legally declared to be deprived of their political rights do not have the right to elect and to be elected; those who have not been declared to be deprived of their political rights and those awaiting trial should have their exercise of electoral rights suspended because they are in detention or custody, and they should not be included in the voter list.

    16. Do criminal offenders who have been granted probation have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: Criminal offenders who have been granted probation do not have the right to elect and to be elected in any of the following circumstances: (1) Counter-revolutionary offenders; (2) General criminal offenders sentenced to death or life imprisonment with probation; (3) General criminal offenders sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment with probation and placed under surveillance.

    17. After a criminal offender is granted parole, do they have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: Criminal offenders sentenced to labor reform or imprisonment who have not been declared to be deprived of their political rights and who are granted parole before the expiration of their sentence have the right to elect and to be elected. Criminal offenders who have been declared to be deprived of their political rights, even if they have been paroled, still do not have the right to elect and to be elected before the period of deprivation of their political rights has expired.

    18. Do criminal offenders who are "released on bail for execution" or "released on bail for medical treatment" have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: "Released on bail for execution" refers to criminals who are released on bail and supervised by the People's Government's public security organs and forced to work, serving their sentences outside of prison (the only difference from serving their sentences inside prison is the place of execution); "released on bail for medical treatment" refers to criminals who are allowed to receive medical treatment outside of prison due to illness and must return to prison to continue serving their sentences after they recover. Therefore, those who have been declared to be deprived of their political rights do not have the right to elect and to be elected; others who have not been declared to be deprived of their political rights should have their exercise of electoral rights suspended because they are still serving their sentences, and they should not be included in the voter list.

    19. Do Han Chinese collaborators during the Anti-Japanese War have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: Han Chinese collaborators during the Anti-Japanese War who have been legally sentenced to imprisonment, surveillance, or declared to be deprived of their political rights do not have the right to elect and to be elected.

    20. Do former puppet soldiers and government personnel who have returned to their hometowns have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: Former puppet soldiers and government personnel who have returned to their hometowns should have the right to elect and to be elected if they have not been legally declared to be under surveillance or deprived of their political rights, abide by government decrees, and have no reactionary behavior.

    21. Do general reactionary party members or general reactionary secret society members have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: General reactionary party members or general reactionary secret society members who have consistently abided by government decrees and have no reactionary behavior after registering or declaring themselves to the People's Government have the right to elect and to be elected.

    22. What are mental patients? Why do mental patients not have the right to elect and to be elected?
    Answer: Mental patients refer to those who have been certified by hospitals, doctors, or institutions and organizations as having lost their mind or being mentally disordered. Because they have lost the ability to exercise their own will, they should not have the right to elect and to be elected.

    Patients with intermittent mental illness have the right to elect and to be elected and should be included in the voter list.

    23. In elections in minority areas, should the people who have the right to elect and to be elected be completely the same as in Han areas?
    Answer: The situation in minority areas is the same as in Han areas in some aspects, but different in others. Therefore, the question of who has the right to elect and to be elected should be determined differently according to the different situations in different areas. In minority areas where the situation is the same as in Han areas, the relevant provisions of Han areas can be applied. In minority areas where the situation is not completely the same as in Han areas or is completely different, there should be different regulations.

    In minority areas where the socio-economic structure is the same as in Han areas and land reform has been implemented, the relevant provisions of Han areas generally apply to who should have the right to elect and to be elected.

    In minority areas where the socio-economic structure is broadly the same as in Han areas but not completely the same, and land reform has been implemented according to the local ethnic situation, all patriotic people who sympathize with land reform, oppose imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and support the People's Government, regardless of their class component, have the right to elect and to be elected. In minority pastoral areas and agricultural areas where land reform has not been implemented, all patriotic people who oppose imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries and support the People's Government, regardless of their class component and social experience, have the right to elect and to be elected.

    中央选举委员会关于选民资格若干问题的解答
    一九五三年四月三日
    一、什么人有选举权和被选举权？
    答　选举法中规定：“凡年满十八周岁之中华人民共和国公民，不分民族和种族、性别、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰、教育程度、财产状况和居住期限，均有选举权和被选举权。”这就是说：凡享有政治权利的中华人民共和国人民，年满十八周岁者，不分他是什么民族和什么种族、男或女、从事什么职业、什么阶级出身、信仰什么宗教、是否上过学校或上过什么学校、有无财产或有多少财产，以及在当地居住时间的长短，均有选举权和被选举权。选举法中这样规定，正是说明我国选举制度的民主的广泛性。
    二、居留于我国境内的外国人，有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　凡是居留于我国境内未取得中华人民共和国国籍的外国人，无选举权和被选举权。其业已取得中华人民共和国国籍，并具有公民资格、年满十八周岁者，有选举权和被选举权。
    三、什么人是地主阶级分子？
    答　地主阶级分子，就是占有土地，自己不劳动，或只有附带的劳动，而靠剥削为生的人。在地主家庭中，凡是不依靠土地剥削为其主要生活来源，而是从事其他职业劳动的人，或常年参加农业劳动而不是居于地主家庭支配地位的人，以及在土地改革完成时未满十八周岁并尚未成为地主家庭中的实际支配人的地主的子女，皆为地主阶级出身，而非地主阶级分子。开明士绅即地主阶级中某些个别的人，曾经反对蒋介石反动统治和帝国主义侵略，以积极行动赞助人民民主事业，并拥护人民民主专政和赞助土地改革者，不以地主阶级分子论。
    四、地主阶级分子，怎样才能改变其成份，取得选举权和被选举权？
    答　地主阶级分子在土地改革完成后，完全服从政府法令，努力从事劳动生产，或作其他经营，没有任何反动行为，连续五年以上者，经法定手续改变其地主成份后，应给予选举权和被选举权。
    地主阶级分子因丧失劳动能力而不能参加劳动，倚靠子女或其他收入生活，在土地改革完成后，完全服从政府法令，无任何反动行为，连续五年以上者，经法定手续改变其地主成份后，应给予选举权和被选举权。
    地主阶级分子在土地改革完成后虽满五年，但如其不努力从事劳动生产或作其他经营，或有任何反动行为，或有违反人民政府法令行为者，仍不应改变其成份，并应继续剥夺其选举权和被选举权。
    上述的“连续五年以上”，应从该地主阶级分子所在乡之土地改革完成即分配了土地之日起算。
    五、地主兼其他成份或其他成份兼地主者，有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　地主兼其他成份，即是依靠土地剥削为其主要生活来源的人，应以地主阶级分子论，在其依法尚未改变地主成份前，无选举权和被选举权。
    其他成份兼地主，即是依靠其他职业劳动为其主要生活来源的人，在土地改革完成后，即照其他成份待遇，有选举权和被选举权。对于既占有并出租大量土地，又从事其他职业劳动的人，其本人的阶级成份，依本人取得主要生活来源的方法决定：如本人当地主的是地主，本人当资本家的是资本家，本人当自由职业者的是自由职业者等。其当地主的以地主阶级分子论，无选举权和被选举权；其当资本家或自由职业者的以资本家或自由职业者论，有选举权和被选举权。
    六、土地改革完成后，地主阶级分子如经营工商业，或在工厂、矿山作工，或从事其他职业劳动者，有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　土地改革完成后，地主阶级分子无论其是经营工商业，或是在工厂、矿山作工，或是从事其他职业劳动，一般皆应连续五年以上，才应改变其成份和给予选举权和被选举权。但如因其劳动生产特别积极，一贯遵守政府法令有显著进步，虽未满五年，经法定手续，可改变其成份，并给予选举权和被选举权。
    七、地主阶级分子为烈军属者，有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　地主阶级分子为烈军属，在土地改革完成后未满五年者，一般无选举权和被选举权。但如其政治上表现积极，经法定手续，可给予选举权和被选举权。
    八、地主家庭中的女子嫁与工、农、贫民，或地主家庭中的男子入赘于工、农、贫民家庭，或地主家庭中的子女过继与工、农、贫民者，有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　不论其是在解放前或解放后，地主家庭中的女子嫁与工、农、贫民者，当其出嫁时并未成为其地主家庭中的实际支配人者，有选举权和被选举权。如其出嫁时已成为其地主家庭中的实际支配人者，出嫁后从事劳动，依为主要生活来源满一年者，承认其为工人、农民、贫民成份，有选举权和被选举权。地主家庭中的男子入赘于工、农、贫民家庭，或地主家庭中的子女过继与工、农、贫民者与前款同。
    九、工、农、贫民家庭中的女子嫁与地主，或工、农、贫民家庭中的男子入赘或卖与地主家庭，或工、农、贫民家庭中的子女过继与地主者，有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　解放前，工、农、贫民家庭中的女子嫁与地主者，如其生活不与地主同等，而与工、农、贫民同等（即靠自己劳动为主要生活来源），或过同等生活不满三年者，依原来成份不变更，有选举权和被选举权。解放后，工、农、贫民家庭中的女子嫁与地主者，其原来成份不变更，有选举权和被选举权。
    解放前后，工、农、贫民家庭中的男子入赘或其子女于解放前卖与地主者，与前款同。解放前，工、农、贫民家庭中的子女过继与地主者，如与其过继父母过同等生活不满五年，或生活不与其过继父母同等，而与其生身父母同等者，依原来成份不变更，有选举权和被选举权。
    十、富农有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　富农应有选举权和被选举权。
    对老解放区的旧富农分子，应根据中央人民政府政务院关于划分农村阶级成份的决定，在土地改革完成后，完全服从政府法令，努力从事劳动生产，或作其他经营，没有任何反动行为，连续三年以上者，应给予选举权和被选举权。
    十一、依法逮捕、判处徒刑或宣布管制的反革命分子，是否剥夺其选举权和被选举权？
    答　根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第七条之规定：“中华人民共和国必须镇压一切反革命活动，严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的国民党反革命战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子。对于一般的反动分子、封建地主、官僚资本家，在解除其武装、消灭其特殊势力后，仍须依法在必要时期内剥夺他们的政治权利”。因此，对于业经依法逮捕、判处徒刑、宣布管制或经人民政府审查确定在目前应剥夺其政治权利的反革命分子，均应剥夺其选举权和被选举权。
    十二、反革命罪犯已经释放或撤销管制后，有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　反革命罪犯在判处徒刑刑期已执行期满获得释放后，在其依法宣布剥夺政治权利的期限尚未执行期满前，仍无选举权和被选举权。被管制的反革命罪犯在撤销其管制后，得视其所犯罪恶的大小，改造程度的好坏，并根据人民群众的意见，而由选举委员会或人民法庭确定其有无选举权利。
    反革命罪犯已经释放或撤销管制后，如其兼具地主身份，而依法尚未改变地主成份者，仍应剥夺其选举权和被选举权。
    凡是本来不应管制而被错误地管制了的分子，应即撤销管制，恢复其选举权利。
    十三、反革命分子的家属，有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　根据管制反革命分子暂行办法第九条之规定：“对反革命分子的管制只限于本人，不得株连其家属、戚友。”因此，对于凡未参与共谋反革命活动的反革命分子的家属，应有选举权和被选举权。
    十四、什么是“其他依法被剥夺政治权利者”？
    答　其他依法被剥夺政治权利者是指：除依法剥夺政治权利的地主阶级分子和反革命分子以外的其他一般刑事罪犯，经人民司法机关宣布剥夺其政治权利的人。
    十五、在关押中的已决犯和未决犯，有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　一切在关押（包括在监狱、劳动改造队及看守所等）中的已决犯，其已经依法宣布剥夺政治权利者，无选举权和被选举权；其未经宣布剥夺政治权利者和未决犯，由于他们在监禁或羁押中，故均应停止其选举权利的行使，并不把他们列入选民名单。
    十六、宣告缓刑的刑事犯，有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　宣告缓刑的刑事犯，有下列情形之一者，无选举权和被选举权：（一）反革命犯；（二）一般刑事犯中的判处死刑或无期徒刑宣告缓刑者；（三）一般刑事犯中的判处有期徒刑宣告缓刑而被管制者。
    十七、刑事犯获得假释后，有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　被判处劳役改造或徒刑未经宣布剥夺其政治权利的刑事犯，刑期未满而获得假释者，有选举权和被选举权。经宣布剥夺政治权利的刑事犯，虽已假释，但在其剥夺政治权利的期限尚未执行期满前，仍无选举权和被选举权。
    十八、“保外执行”或“保外就医”的刑事犯，有无选举权和被选举权？答　“保外执行”系具保保出，并受人民政府公安机关监督与强迫其劳动，在监外执行刑期的罪犯（与在监内执行，仅是执行场所的不同）；“保外就医”系因病而准其在外医治，病好后，立即回监继续执行监禁的罪犯。因此，业经宣布剥夺政治权利者，无选举权和被选举权；其他未经宣布剥夺政治权利者，因其仍在执行监禁的刑期期间，故均应停止其选举权利的行使，并不把他们列入选民名单。
    十九、抗日战争时期的汉奸分子，有无选举权和被选举权？
    答　抗日战争时期的汉奸分子，经依法判处徒刑、管制或宣布剥夺政治权利者，均无选举权和被选举权。

    二十二、什么是精神病患者？为什么精神病患者无选举权和被选举权？
    答　精神病患者，就是指：经医院、医生或机关、团体证明心神丧失、精神错乱的人。因为他们已失去了行使自己意志的能力，故不应有选举权和被选举权。
    间歇性精神病患者，有选举权和被选举权，并应列入选民名单。
    二十三、少数民族地区的选举，什么人应享有选举权和被选举权，是否与汉族地区完全一样？
    答　少数民族地区的情况和汉族地区有相同的，也有不同的。因此，对于什么人有选举权和被选举权的问题，应按不同地区的情况而有不同的规定。其与汉族地区情况相同的少数民族地区，可与汉族地区相同。其与汉族地区情况不完全相同或情况完全不同的少数民族地区，则应有不同的规定。
    少数民族地区，其社会经济结构和汉族地区相同并已经实行过土地改革者，什么人应有选举权和被选举权，一般适用汉族地区的有关规定。
    少数民族地区，其社会经济结构与汉族地区大体相同，但不完全相同，并已经按当地民族情况实行过土地改革者，凡一切同情土地改革、反对帝国主义和国民党反动派、拥护人民政府的爱国人士，不问其阶级成份如何，均有选举权和被选举权。少数民族的牧业区，和未经土地改革的农业区，一切反对帝国主义和国民党反动派、拥护人民政府的爱国人士，不问其阶级成份及社会经历，均有选举权和被选举权。
