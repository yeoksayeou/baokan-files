    Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Plans to Increase Grain Production by Making Good Planting Preparations

    The Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, has completed its first-quarter production tasks for 1953 ahead of schedule and has made all preparations for spring plowing and sowing. During the four months of the first quarter, the organization and various systems within the cooperative were further improved. In addition, they accumulated 35,000 loads of sheep manure, pen manure, night soil, and Artemisia manure, and selected more than 1,000 jin of superior varieties. They have prepared 100,000 jin of fuel, enough for the spring plowing and sowing period. The agents and farm tools used for seed mixing are also ready. They used manual labor to pad up 1.2 mu of beach land, which can be sown in the spring. They also dug a new well in the field and built nine sheep kilns (using sheep kilns to step in circles and accumulate fertilizer in the field can save a lot of labor for delivering manure). This year, they started with a double-horse-drawn plow and a double-handled small Western plow, as well as a disc harrow shared with Xigou Village. Seeing the production achievements in the first quarter and the new-style agricultural tools, the enthusiasm of the co-op members for production has been particularly high. The fifth group launched a competition to all groups in the co-op. Two people were supposed to do ten work points per day according to the contracting standard, but they did twenty-eight work points when carrying fertilizer. After finishing their assigned manure delivery, this group also helped other groups deliver more than 600 loads of manure. Under the promotion of this group, all groups finished delivering manure ahead of schedule. Generally, labor efficiency has been improved by about 20%. Thirty-nine women were assigned to the work of planing stubble, destroying a total of 227 mu of stubble (the stubble can be used as fuel after planing, and it also has a great effect on insect prevention). Now, the entire co-op has summarized the production achievements of the first quarter, announced the work points earned by each person in the entire quarter, and started to shift to the second quarter production competition movement. After democratic discussion, they determined the production plan for the second quarter. In agriculture, they will focus on the following links: 1. Plant superior varieties according to local conditions to greatly increase grain production. Golden Queen corn will be planted on the river beach, accounting for 20.7% of the co-op's land; local corn will be planted on the terraced fields, accounting for 27.8% of the co-op's land; the area planted with millet accounts for 27.2% of the co-op's land; the sown wheat fields account for 11.5% of the co-op's land. 2. Learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implement close planting. Last year, 1,100 to 2,200 plants of corn were planted per mu; this year, 1,800 to 2,200 plants will be planted; last year, 18,000 to 20,000 plants of millet were planted per mu, and this year it will be increased to 22,000 to 32,000 plants. 3. Shallow plowing and fine harrowing to preserve moisture, ensure timely planting, and overcome the spring drought. Repair the large and small collapses of the terraced fields to conserve soil and water; build three new small drought canals, which can use floodwater to irrigate 30 mu of land. In forestry, a total of 2,000 fruit trees and timber trees will be planted, including 150 large red apple trees. In addition, a nursery of 0.8 mu will be newly opened; 1.4 mu of grape seedlings will be planted by layering, and a large number of pepper trees will be planted. In animal husbandry, the focus will be on breeding and improving varieties. It is planned to breed 120 lambs and one small donkey, mate three mares with Soviet stallions, and select good breeding livestock to mate five cows and five donkeys; in addition, one large horse will be purchased. In order to ensure the realization of these plans, they will conscientiously implement the provisions of the co-op's regulations, implement the contracting production responsibility system, achieve clear rewards and punishments, and frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism; carry out competitions between groups and between people within the co-op, and combine the competition with learning advanced production-increasing experience; implement the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of women for production.

    郭玉恩农业生产合作社
    作好播种准备工作计划大力增产粮食
    山西平顺县川底村郭玉恩农业生产合作社已经提前完成一九五三年第一季度生产任务，做好了春耕播种的一切准备工作，全社土地已经普遍犁过一遍。在第一季度的四个月中，他们社内更加健全了组织领导和各种制度。此外，他们共积了羊肥、圈肥、圊肥、蒿肥三万五千担，选了优良品种共一千多斤。燃料已准备了十万斤，足够春耕播种期间用。拌种时所用的药剂和农具也已准备齐全。他们用人工垫起滩地一亩二分，春耕时就可以播种。他们还在地里新凿了一眼井，打了九孔羊窑（利用羊窑在地里踩圈积肥，能省出不少送粪的工）。今年他们开始有了双骅马拉犁一架，双把小洋犁一张，还有一架圆盘耙和西沟村合用。看到了第一季度的生产成绩和新来的新式农具，社员们生产热情特别高涨。第五小组向全社各小组发起了竞赛。有两个人按包工标准每天应做十分工，在担送肥料时却做到二十八分工。这个小组把自己应送的粪送完后，还帮助别的小组送粪六百多担。在这个小组的推动下，各组都提早送完了粪。一般提高了劳动效率约百分之二十。妇女三十九人分配了刨茬子的工作，共灭茬二百二十七亩（茬子刨出来可作燃料，同时对防虫有很大作用）。现在，全社已经总结了第一季度的生产成绩，公布了每个人全季所做的工分，开始转入第二季度生产竞赛运动。他们经过民主讨论确定了第二季度的生产计划。在农业方面，抓住这样几个环节：1、因地种植优良品种，大量增产粮食。河滩上种金黄后玉米，占全社土地的百分之二十点七；在梯田上种土玉米，占全社土地的百分之二十七点八；种谷子的面积占全社土地的百分之二十七点二；已播种的麦田占全社土地的百分之十一点五。2、学习苏联先进经验，实行密植。玉米去年每亩植一千一百株到二千二百株；今年要植一千八百株到二千二百株；谷子去年每亩为一万八千株到两万株，今年要增加为二万二千株到三万二千株。3、浅耕细耙保墒，保证适时点种，战胜春旱。整修梯田的大小塌岸，保土保水；新修小旱渠三道，可利用洪水浇地三十亩。在林业方面，要植果树、木料树共二千株，其中包括大红苹果树一百五十株，此外，要新辟八分地的苗圃；压条种植一亩四分葡萄秧，大量栽植花椒树。在畜牧方面，确定以繁殖为主和改良品种，计划繁殖小羊一百二十只，小驴一头，用苏联种马交配母马三匹，选择好种畜配牛五头、驴五头；此外买大马一匹。为了保证实现这些计划，他们将认真执行社章的规定，实行包工包产责任制，做到奖惩严明，经常开展批评和自我批评；开展社内组和组及人和人的竞赛，把竞赛和学习先进增产经验结合起来；贯彻男女同工同酬的原则，充分发挥妇女的生产积极性。
