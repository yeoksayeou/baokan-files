    Correcting Errors in Neglecting Forestry Work

    The "Summary of Readers' Letters" column published six letters in February and March criticizing certain regions for neglecting forestry work, resulting in logging or forest fires.  A summary of the relevant local people's governments' responses to the readers' criticisms is now published below:

    The People's Government of Daxing County, Hebei Province, sent a letter making a self-criticism regarding the issue of allowing the masses to cut down seedlings, as criticized by reader Fu Kexiang on March 23rd. They analyzed the reasons for this situation, which included a one-sided understanding of policies and insufficient forestry education for the masses. The People's Court of Huoshan County, Anhui Province, sent a letter accepting the suggestion from readers Li Zuolai et al. on March 23rd to seriously deal with the mountain fire incident in Dahuaping District of the county.  The court has submitted a request to the higher-level court to re-examine the matter and sentenced the person responsible for the fire that burned more than 600 mu of mountain area due to negligence to one year of imprisonment with one year of probation. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Anhui Provincial People's Government sent a letter reporting the results of the investigation into the mountain fire incident at the Daliu Sheep Farm in the province, which was exposed by reader Fang Ye on February 3rd. The fire at the Daliu Sheep Farm was confirmed, and the farm had already disciplined the perpetrators and made a self-criticism to the local masses after the incident; the reader's criticism that the farm did not take any action afterward is inconsistent with the facts. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Henan Province sent a letter saying:  The opinion of reader Li Xingbei on March 23rd, regarding "the People's Government of Qinyang County, Henan Province, should educate the masses not to cut down trees in Jincheng County, Shanxi Province," is being addressed.

    The letters from the above units all mentioned that they have strengthened forestry education for cadres and the masses, issued circulars on typical cases of destroying trees to attract everyone's attention, and improved mass forestry organizations to do a good job in forestry protection and fire prevention in the future.

    In addition, among the letters regarding forestry work published in the "Summary of Readers' Letters" column in March, there are still two incidents that have not been answered: "Mianzhu Girls' High School violated government regulations by indiscriminately logging trees during the school construction project" and "The local People's Government in the Weining mountainous area of Guizhou Province should educate the masses not to cut down trees indiscriminately." We hope they will respond as soon as possible.

### 纠正忽视护林工作的错误

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    纠正忽视护林工作的错误
    “读者来信摘要”栏在二、三两月中发表了六件读者批评某些地区忽视护林工作，以致发生砍伐林木或山林火灾事件的来信。现将各有关地区人民政府对读者批评的反应综合摘要发表如下：
    河北大兴县人民政府来信，对三月二十三日读者傅科祥批评该县放纵群众采伐树苗问题作了检讨。他们分析了产生这种情况的原因，是对政策掌握片面，对群众进行护林教育不够。安徽霍山县人民法院来信，接受三月二十三日读者李作来等关于严肃处理该县大化坪区烧山事件的建议。该院已呈准上级法院，对此事重作处理，判处因过失而引起烧山六百多亩事件的责任者以徒刑一年，宣告缓刑一年。安徽省人民政府农林厅来信，报告了对二月三日读者放野揭发该省大柳羊场烧山事件的检查结果。大柳羊场失火烧山事件属实，该场在事件发生后已给肇祸者以处分并对当地群众作了检讨；读者批评该场事后不作处理这一点与事实不符。河南省农林厅来信说：三月二十三日读者李兴北关于“河南沁阳县人民政府应教育群众不要到山西晋城县砍伐林木”的意见，正在处理中。
    以上各单位的来信中，都提到他们已加强对干部和群众进行护林教育，把破坏林木的典型事件发通报以引起大家注意，并健全群众性的护林组织，以做好今后的护林防火工作。
    此外，“读者来信摘要”栏在三月份发表的关于护林工作的来信中，还有“绵竹女中在建校工程中违反政府规定滥伐林木”，“贵州威宁山区当地人民政府应教育群众不要乱砍林木”二个事件没有得到答复；希望他们尽早答复。
