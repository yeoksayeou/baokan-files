Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd—Paris "l'Humanité" reporter, Béquet, reported from Kaesong on the 22nd regarding the two completely opposite situations of the American and Korean-Chinese sides receiving and repatriating prisoners of war. According to reports from American news agencies, so far, the repatriated Americans have been herded into places resembling concentration camps. The evacuation hospital near Seoul is surrounded by the American secret service—the notorious Counter Intelligence Corps; meanwhile, secret agents are stationed everywhere. News reporters are not allowed to visit, and all telephone calls must go through the Counter Intelligence Corps agents. The Counter Intelligence Corps agents refuse to disclose any information about the prisoners of war. According to the Rhee Syngman's Ministry of National Defense, the South Korean prisoners of war who have already been repatriated have been subjected to even stricter surveillance than the Americans, and strict precautions are taken against "communist underground activities approaching them." They have begun the initial stage of a six-month "screening and training." It seems that a batch of disabled prisoners of war has just left the barbed wire camps on Geoje Island, and a new batch of people will soon be crammed in—to make them forget the humanitarian treatment they received in the North.

On the Korean-Chinese side, there are no concentration camps waiting for the survivors returning from the American death camps. They are warmly welcomed by the authorities and local people. Korea's best cultural troupe—the Korean People's Army Cultural Troupe and the National Theatre, as well as the best cultural troupes from China, are here to specially welcome and entertain them.

    两种完全相反的接待遣返战俘的情形
    【新华社二十三日讯】巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌二十二日自开城报道美方和朝中方面接待遣返战俘的两种截然不同的情形说，据美国通讯社报道，到目前为止，被遣返的美国人都被撵入类似集中营的地方。汉城附近的撤退医院被美国的特务机关——臭名远扬的反间谍队所包围了；同时，特务人员分布在每一个地方。新闻记者不准前往访问，所有电话都要通过反间谍队的特务。反间谍队的特务们拒绝透露有关战俘的任何消息。据李承晚的国防部说，对已经被遣返的南朝鲜战俘，已加以比美国人所受到的监视还要严格的监视，并严密防范“共产党地下活动接近他们”。他们已开始了六个月“甄别和受训” 的最初的阶段。看来，巨济岛上刺铁丝网内的营场中刚刚走掉了一批残废战俘，紧随着就又要装满一批新的人——为了使他们忘掉他们在北方受到的人道待遇。
    在朝中方面这一边，没有集中营等待从美国死亡营里回来的幸存者。他们受到当局和当地人民的热烈欢迎。朝鲜的最优秀的文工团——朝鲜人民军文工团和国家剧团，以及来自中国的最好的文工团，都在这里特意欢迎和招待他们。
