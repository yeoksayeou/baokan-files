Paris "L'Humanité" reporter Béquet reports from Kaesong: The first group of sick and wounded prisoners of war repatriated by the Korean-Chinese side began their journey by vehicle along the road from the POW camps on the Yalu River to Kaesong shortly after dawn on the 14th. They travelled along the road, frequently crossing bridges that the U.S. Air Force had used all its strength to bomb for nearly three years, attempting to cut off traffic. It is worth noting that the U.S. military had bombed this road particularly heavily the previous night, even though they had already been notified that a convoy carrying sick and wounded prisoners of war would be passing along this road.

Kaesong is actively preparing to receive the prisoners of war. I visited several large hospitals that are being prepared to accommodate the sick and wounded POWs. Glaziers, carpenters, upholsterers, and soldiers from the Korean-Chinese forces are all busy repairing the best and sturdiest houses in Kaesong to receive the repatriated personnel. Most of the repatriated personnel can live in very good and sturdy houses, and hundreds of tents have also been set up. Nurses on the Korean-Chinese side are busily filling mattresses and pillows with fragrant hay, busy making beds and helping to set up tents. Many Korean-Chinese doctors and nurses have arrived in Kaesong to supervise the preparations.

American, British, and other non-Korean prisoners of war will be housed in the former museum in Kaesong, which is perhaps the sturdiest building in this heavily bombed city. Glaziers have repaired all the windows, and carpenters are busy working.

Separate hospitals have been set up to accommodate prisoners of war being sent out and received, accommodating surgical patients and general patients. I visited a hospital being prepared to accommodate Korean prisoners of war. This hospital is located in a 300-year-old Confucian temple. After a rapid medical examination upon arrival, those who are not seriously injured can go to the barber for a haircut and shave and take a bath. In the bathhouse, they will take off the clothes issued by the U.S. side and go to the reception room connected to the bathhouse to change into new clothes. Then, according to the severity of their illness and injury, they will be assigned very comfortable beds.

Each hospital has sufficient medical staff and a complete set of laboratory equipment, and each hospital can perform emergency surgery. A thorough medical examination will be conducted immediately upon the arrival of the prisoners of war.

Now the prisoners of war have begun their long journey home, but the U.S. side has not yet responded to the issue of resuming armistice negotiations.

    朝中方面积极准备接收病伤战俘的工作
    【新华社十五日讯】据巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌自开城报道：朝中方面遣返的第一批病伤战俘，在十四日拂晓后不久就开始乘车沿着公路从鸭绿江边的战俘营到开城去。他们在公路上行进着，不时穿过桥梁，在将近三年之中，美国空军曾经用了全部力量来轰炸这些公路和桥梁，企图断绝交通。值得注意的是，前一晚美军特别猛烈地轰炸了这条公路，而他们早已得到通知，知道载运病伤战俘的汽车队要在这条公路上经过。
    开城正在积极进行接收战俘的准备工作。我参观了准备收容病伤战俘的几个大医院。玻璃匠、木匠、裱糊匠和朝中部队的士兵都忙着把开城最好和最牢固的房子修理好，以接待被遣返的人员。被遣返的人员大部分可以住在很好和很牢固的房子里，另外还搭起了几百个帐篷。朝中方面的护士们忙碌地用喷香的干草填装着垫子和枕头，忙着摆床铺和帮助搭帐篷。许多朝中方面的医生和护士已经到达开城，来监督进行准备工作。
    美国、英国和其他非朝鲜籍的战俘将住在开城从前的博物馆里，这个博物馆或许是这个曾遭到猛烈轰炸的城市中最坚固的房子。玻璃匠已经把所有的窗子都修理好了，木匠们在忙着做活。
    一些分隔开的医院已经设立起来，准备收容送出去和接收进来的战俘，收容外科病人和一般的病人。我访问了准备收容朝鲜籍战俘的一个医院。这医院设在一个有三百年历史的孔庙里。被遣返的人员到这里后经过迅速的医疗检查后，伤势不重的人就可以去理发、刮胡子和洗澡，他们将在澡房里脱掉美方发的衣服，到和澡房相连的接待室去换新衣服。然后将按照他们病情和伤势的轻重，分配给他们很舒适的床位。
    每个医院都有足够的医务人员，有整套的化验设备，每个医院都可以进行紧急手术。战俘到达后就马上进行彻底的医疗检查。
    现在战俘们已经开始了回家的长途旅行，但是美方对于恢复停战谈判的问题还没有做出答复。
