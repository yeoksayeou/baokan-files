Benxi Caitun Vertical Shaft Experiences Serious Lack of Accountability
Major Projects Behind Schedule

[This newspaper report] (From Our Newspaper) The Benxi Coal Mine's Caitun Vertical Shaft project has long suffered from a lack of accountability, resulting in poor performance on key project tasks. The Caitun Vertical Shaft is a key national construction project, slated to begin coal extraction next year to supply the metallurgical sector. However, the Caitun Vertical Shaft failed to meet its primary project targets for January and February of this year. According to the inspection results of the joint inspection team sent to the vertical shaft by the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Benxi Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Coal and Iron Company: the two most important projects that directly affect coal production time, the down-dip rock heading and the auxiliary shaft sinking, are progressing very poorly (the "down-dip rock heading" is a tunnel heading towards the coal seam, sloping downwards, hence the term "down-dip". The auxiliary shaft is the shaft used for bringing people and pit props in during future mining operations. Failure to complete either of these projects will prevent coal extraction). The down-dip rock heading only completed 29% of the state plan in January and 34% in February; the auxiliary shaft sinking only completed 46% of the state plan in January and 57% in February. Additionally, the auxiliary shaft wall construction project, scheduled to commence on January 3rd, and the bottom-of-shaft locomotive installation project, scheduled to commence on February 1st, have not yet begun.

These problems existed last year. Last year, the total volume of rock tunnel excavation for the vertical shaft's main projects reached 111% of the state plan, but the down-dip heading project, which is directly related to coal mining, only achieved 48% of the state plan. Meanwhile, the less urgent level heading (underground access tunnels) excavation had already reached the required level for 1954. Arch lining of roadways reached 111%, but seven more difficult "intersections" were not carried out. The auxiliary shaft sinking also only completed 74% of the state plan, seriously affecting the progress of the national plan. Such a practice of "avoiding the difficult and choosing the easy, inverting the importance of tasks" not only yields minimal economic value but also wastes substantial national funds.

There are many objective difficulties in the vertical shaft project, such as simultaneous design and construction, untimely supply of materials and equipment, and limited assistance from the original Coal and Iron Company's Capital Construction Department in resolving specific issues. However, based on the failure to meet the plan in January and February, the Benxi Caitun Coal Mine's leadership's subjective efforts were insufficient. The serious lack of accountability in the project is the primary reason why the mine cannot fulfill the national plan.

The long-term failure to complete the down-dip heading task is primarily due to internal chaos within the mine's mining engineering section responsible for this project. For example,

Regarding the failure of the "05" and "09" down-dips to complete their tasks in February, the leading cadres of the mining engineering section only complained about "the lack of water pumps and motors," paying little attention to serious problems such as violations of operating procedures during construction, delays in the project, and low worker attendance. The lack of water pumps is the responsibility of the operations section, but the operations section does not know how many water pumps are lacking, only knowing to ask the mine director, who then asks the company, and when the company doesn't fully supply them, the mine leadership doesn't actively seek solutions. In fact, the mine has a batch of high-capacity water pumps left over from the puppet Manchurian regime that could be used after repair. The mine also considered this repair project to be very important and had drawn up three repair work plans since July of last year. However, due to a lack of accountability, the plans were not effectively implemented and dragged on until recently when they were test-run.

Furthermore, regarding the lack of water pump motors, the mine's leading cadres said it was "impossible to solve." However, among the 41 motors ordered from abroad that arrived in November of last year, 24 could be used for the down-dip, but because they were 50 Hz (the mine needs 60 Hz), they were left sleeping in the warehouse, and the mine did not think of ways to utilize them.

The reason for the failure to complete the auxiliary shaft sinking task is the frequent blockage of the drainage equipment – the "central pipe." In January and February, due to handling the central pipe, repairing water pumps, icing in the shaft, and power outages, a total of 456 hours of work were lost, which is equivalent to 19 full days of no work. Calculated based on the average quota, this equates to a loss of 19 meters of progress. The state plan that was not completed in January and February was 12.3 meters. According to the inspection team's report, apart from the three hours of unavoidable power outages, the accidents that affected the work could all have been avoided. For example, the "central pipe" is a very old item left over from the puppet Manchurian regime and should not have been used as the primary drainage equipment. However, the auxiliary shaft leadership believed that even if it blocked once every two days, it could be handled within three hours without affecting the task. But in mid-January, after it blocked, it took more than ten days of continuous work to resolve the issue. They had to install a water pump, but after the pump was installed, it was frequently damaged due to a lack of responsible protection. On one occasion, Li Shigui, the head of the auxiliary shaft electrical and mechanical section, asked Kong Xianyong, the deputy head of the mining engineering section responsible for the auxiliary shaft project:

"The pipe is blocked; how will the task be completed?" Kong Xianyong replied:

"You ask me, who do I ask?" When asked again, "What if the water pump breaks down?" He replied, "Then we'll have a major work stoppage!" As a result, the auxiliary shaft task was affected, and the "major work stoppage" resulted in only a little over one meter of progress in March.

The most serious manifestation of the lack of accountability at the mine is the absence of a dedicated person responsible for directing the overall progress of the mine's projects. Last year, when the down-dip project failed to meet its target, the mining engineering section, in order to pursue "completion" of the rock tunnel excavation task, did more level headings to compensate. The mine leadership not only did not stop this wrong practice but even repeatedly praised it. For example, at the beginning of the large water pump repair project, a 42-degree elbow pipe needed to be installed. Someone arbitrarily changed the drawing incorrectly, and as a result, the mine's former electrical and mechanical section made it according to the wrong drawing. The elbow pipe could not be installed, and the mining engineering section could not find out who made the change. In August of last year, due to excessive depth of excavation, the original 30-horsepower motor on the "01" down-dip could not handle the load and needed to be replaced with a 50-horsepower motor. This problem was not resolved, and the project was stopped. It was not until January of this year that a 50-horsepower motor was found, but after it was installed, it was discovered that a winch "bearing shoe" was missing. The mining engineering section believed that the original "bearing shoe" could still be used for half a year, while the technical safety section said it could not be used. The operations section then entrusted the works section to repair it, and the works section casually thought it could be used, but the technical safety section did not allow it to be used, which dragged on for more than a month. The "01" down-dip was stopped for more than a month. Later, after the "bearing shoe" was repaired by the works section, it was discovered that the ring gear could not be used, and this problem has not been resolved to this day.

The long-term existence of these phenomena of lack of accountability is inseparable from the mine leadership's bureaucratism. Mine Director He Jianhua usually relies only on holding meetings to assign work and on reports to understand the situation. After the work is assigned, there is no inspection, so even if false reports are made below, he does not know. When the task is not completed, the mine director chases the sections, the section chiefs chase the unit heads, and the unit heads call a meeting with the workers. They either do not understand the problems below, or they understand them but do not study them, or they study them but do not solve them. Therefore, when problems are encountered below, they are pushed upwards layer by layer.

The failure of the mine's major projects to be completed is also inseparable from the mine's Party organization's relaxation of its responsibility to guarantee and supervise production and its abandonment of ideological leadership. The mine's Party organization completely ignored production during the "Three-Anti" movement from January to July of last year. From August to the present, these serious problems in the vertical shaft project have never been formally discussed at a Party committee meeting; little principled criticism has been made of the administrative leadership's bureaucratic style and its business-oriented and formalistic working methods. Regarding the problems existing in the mine, the responsible comrades of the Party committee are also only making empty calls for facing difficulties without studying concrete solutions.

The original Benxi Coal and Iron Company also did not pay enough attention to the vertical shaft project. Last year, the mine's major projects, such as the down-dip and auxiliary shaft tasks, were never completed. The company only listened to the mine's "good news" and did not conduct inspections, so it could not correct deviations in a timely manner, but instead mistakenly praised them many times. The company also did not solve the specific difficulties raised by the mine well. Taking the water pump motor as an example, the mine raised this problem in January. Among the batch of motors manufactured by the company's affiliated electrical repair factory, ten could be used for the vertical shaft down-dip, but the company did not allocate them.

    本溪彩屯竖井无人负责现象严重
    主要工程长期不能完成计划
    【本报讯】本溪煤矿彩屯竖井工程长期存在无人负责现象，主要工程任务完成得很差。彩屯竖井是国家建设的重点工程之一，按照国家计划，预定于明年开始采煤，供应冶金部门使用。但是彩屯竖井今年一、二月份的主要工程，都没有完成任务。据中共本溪市委、本溪市总工会、煤铁公司联合检查组竖井检查小组的检查结果：彩屯竖井的最主要的、直接影响出煤时间的下山岩石掘进和副井井筒开凿两项工程完成得很差（“下山岩石掘进”是掘向煤层的坑道，坡度向下，所以叫“下山”。副井是将来开采时进人和坑木的井筒。这两项工程中任何一项不完成，就不能采煤）。下山岩石掘进一月份只完成国家计划百分之二十九，二月份只完成百分之三十四；副井井筒开凿一月份只完成国家计划百分之四十六，二月份只完成百分之五十七。另外，计划中规定在一月三日开工的副井井筒筑壁工程，和二月一日开工的井底引车机安装工程，到现在还没有开工。
    这些情况在去年就有。去年竖井的主要工程岩石坑道掘进总量完成国家计划百分之一百一十一，但其中直接关系采煤的下山掘进工程，只完成国家计划百分之四十八，而不迫切需要的平巷坑道（井下的交通道）掘进，却已开凿到一九五四年的需要的程度；巷道砌?完成百分之一百一十一，但有七个比较困难的“三岔口”工程都没有进行；副井井筒开凿也只完成国家计划百分之七十四，因而严重地影响了国家计划进度。像这样“避难就易，轻重倒置”的作法，结果不仅经济价值很小，而且浪费了国家大量资金。
    竖井工程中的客观困难是很多的，如工程边设计边施工、材料设备供应不及时、原煤铁公司基本建设处帮助解决具体问题不多。但根据一、二月份不能完成计划的情况看，彩屯煤矿领导方面主观努力不够，工程中存在严重的无人负责现象，却是该矿不能完成国家计划的主要原因。
    下山掘进长期不能完成任务，主要原因是负责这个工程的该矿井工科内部混乱所造成的。比如，
    “○五”、“○九”两个下山二月份没有完成任务，井工科领导干部只管埋怨“缺水泵、缺马达”，对他们本身在施工中的违反操作规程、拖延工程、工人出勤率低等严重问题，却很少注意。没有水泵是运转科的责任，而运转科却不知道缺几台水泵，只知找矿长要，矿长就找公司要，公司没给全部供应，矿领导方面也不积极想办法。其实该矿有一批伪满遗留下来的能力很大的水泵，检修后便能使用。该矿也认为这个修复工程很重要，从去年七月起，曾订过三次修复工作计划。但是都因为无人负责，计划没有切实执行，拖拖拉拉，直至最近才试转。
    又如缺乏水泵马达，该矿领导干部说是“无法解决”。但在去年十一月调来的国外定货四十一台马达中，即有二十四台可以用于下山，只因那是五○周波（矿里要六○周波），即放在仓库里睡觉，该矿也没有想过办法加以利用。
    副井井筒开凿不能完成任务的原因是排水设备——“中心管子”经常堵塞。在一、二月份中，因处理中心管子、修理水泵、井筒打冰、停电等原因，共影响工作四百五十六小时，即等于十九整天没有工作，按平均定额计算，相当于十九公尺的进度。而
    一、二月份没有完成的国家计划，是十二点三公尺。据检查组报告，除了停电三小时无法避免以外，影响工作的事故都是可以避免的。比如，“中心管子”是伪满遗留下来非常陈旧的东西，本来是不能把它作为主要排水设备的，但副井领导方面认为即使两天堵一次，在三小时内处理完了，也不会影响任务。但在一月中旬堵住后，接连处理了十多天，还没有处理好，只好安水泵，水泵安好后，又因无人负责保护，常出故障。有一次，副井机电股长李世贵问负责副井工程的井工科副科长孔宪永：
    “管子堵了，任务怎么完成？”孔宪永竟这样回答：
    “你问我，我问谁？”再问他：“水泵坏了怎么办？”又回答：“大停工呗！”就是这样，终于影响副井任务的完成，“大停工”的结果使得三月份只掘进了一公尺多。
    该矿的无人负责现象，表现得最严重的是全矿工程进度无专人负责指挥。去年下山工程没有完成任务，井工科为了追求岩石坑道掘进的“完成”任务，便多做平巷填补。矿领导方面对这种错误作法不但没有加以制止，反而多次表扬。又如修复大水泵工程开始时，要安一段四十二度弯管，有人乱作主张，把图样改错了，结果该矿前机电科就照错样子作出来，弯管安不下去，井工科追查是谁改的也查不出来。“○一”下山在去年八月份，因掘进深了，原来的三十马力的马达绞不动，需要换一台五十马力的马达，这问题没有得到解决，工程一直停工，直到今年一月份，才找出了一台五十马力的马达，但安上后又发现缺一个绞车“卧屑”，原来的“卧屑”井工科认为还可以用半年，技术保安科则说不能用，运转科就委托工务科修理，工务科也马马虎虎地认为能用，技术保安科又不让用，这样就拖了一个多月，“○一”下山也就又停工了一个多月。后来“卧屑”由工务科修出来后，又发现牙轮不能使用，这问题一直到现在还没有解决。
    这些无人负责的现象长期存在是与该矿领导方面的官僚主义分不开的。该矿何建华矿长平常只是依靠开会布置工作，依靠汇报掌握情况，工作布置以后没有检查，因此即使下面打假报告他也不知道。任务完不成，矿长追各科，科长追股长，股长就找工人开一个会。他们对于下面存在问题不是不了解，就是了解了不研究，或研究了不解决。因此下面遇到困难，就层层往上推。
    该矿主要工程不能完成任务，也是和该矿党组织放松对生产的保证、监督责任，以及放弃思想领导分不开的。该矿党组织在去年一月到七月的“三反”运动期中，根本不管生产。从八月份起到现在，从来没有在党委会议上正式讨论过一次竖井工程中的这些严重问题；对行政领导方面的官僚主义作风和事务主义、形式主义的工作方法，很少进行原则性的批判。对于该矿存在的问题，党委负责同志也是空喊困难，没有研究具体解决办法。
    原本溪煤铁公司对竖井工程的领导也是不够重视的。去年该矿主要工程如下山、副井的任务从未完成，公司光听该矿的“喜报”，没有进行检查，就不能及时纠正偏向，反而错误地进行过多次表扬。对矿上提出的具体困难问题，公司也没有很好予以解决，以水泵马达为例，矿上在一月份就提了这个问题，公司所属电机修理厂制造出一批马达中，有十台可用于竖井下山，公司也没有予以调拨。
