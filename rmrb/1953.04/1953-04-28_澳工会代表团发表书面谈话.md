Xinhua News Agency, April 27th:

    The Australian trade union delegation, invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to participate in the May 1st International Labor Day and the Seventh National Labor Congress, has issued a written statement, the full text of which is as follows:

    Despite the war-mongering propaganda of Australian warmongers, the Australian people's belief in the Chinese people's desire for peace remains unshaken. Recent events, such as the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war and the resumption of full-scale Korean armistice negotiations, have given Australian peace activists immense strength, just as they have brought enormous strength to the whole world. Despite the despicable deception employed by Australian newspapers, they have been unable to conceal from our people the fact that the prisoners handed over to the US side in Korea support world peace, nor can they hide the gratitude these prisoners feel for the kind treatment they received while detained by the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    The Australian delegation of six people attending the Seventh National Labor Congress of China, comes with the warmest friendship towards the Chinese people. We are greatly astonished by the rapid progress made by Chinese comrades in material construction and in understanding and promoting the international solidarity of the working class since liberation. Your victorious struggles under extremely difficult conditions, your cheerful, courageous, and effective continuous solution of the problems of today and tomorrow, have given us unprecedented great encouragement. We will do our utmost to bring back this encouragement and the spirit of people's friendship and solidarity to inspire our people and help us win the struggle against the warmongers and for peace.

    澳工会代表团发表书面谈话
    【新华社二十七日讯】应中华全国总工会的邀请，前来我国参加“五一”国际劳动节和第七次全国劳动大会的澳大利亚工会代表团发表书面谈话，全文如下：
    尽管澳大利亚战争贩子造谣诽谤，澳大利亚人民对中国人民要求和平的愿望的信念仍然毫不动摇。最近发生的事件，如交换病伤战俘和恢复朝鲜全面停战谈判，正如它给全世界带来巨大的力量一样，已经给澳大利亚的和平战士带来了巨大的力量。尽管澳大利亚报纸使用最卑鄙的欺骗手段，但它们仍然无法对我国人民掩盖在朝鲜交给美方的俘虏拥护世界和平的事实，也无法掩饰这些俘虏对在被中国志愿军拘留期间受到的宽待的感激。
    我们参加中国第七次全国劳动大会的澳大利亚六人代表团，怀着对中国人民的最热烈的友谊。中国同志在解放以后在物质建设以及在体会和促进国际工人阶级团结方面获得的迅速进步，使我们感到非常惊奇。你们在极其困难的条件下所进行的胜利斗争，你们那样愉快、勇敢而有效地不断解决今天和明天的问题，使我们得到了从来没有过的极大鼓舞。我们一定尽我们最大的力量把这种鼓舞和人民友好团结的精神带回去，以鼓舞我国人民，帮助我们赢得反对战争贩子、争取和平的斗争。
