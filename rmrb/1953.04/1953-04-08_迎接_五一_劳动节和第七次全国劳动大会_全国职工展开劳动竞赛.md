    [Dispatch from this newspaper] Currently, workers across the country are actively launching labor competitions to realize the 1953 production plan, welcoming the "May Day" International Labor Day and the Seventh National Labor Congress.
    In early March, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions issued a call to workers throughout the region to launch a labor competition to welcome "May Day" and the Seventh National Labor Congress. The call required workers throughout the region to earnestly discuss the country's production and engineering plans, explore potential, oppose conservative ideas, and carry out patriotic labor competitions. In the competition, efforts should be made to learn from advanced Soviet experience and promote various advanced experiences. All workers of the model factory—Factory 53—were the first to respond and enthusiastically launched a labor competition. Zhang Fuchang, a worker in the Sixth Workshop of the factory, implemented two new technical measures in the competition, increasing work efficiency by nearly one-fold. The Ma Hengchang Workshop of Northeast Machinery Factory 15 drew up an advanced production plan and prepared to launch a competition after signing a collective contract. The workers of the Niu Shuhai model workshop of the Shangzhi County Oil Factory in Songjiang Province promised to further master scientific winemaking methods and increase the alcohol yield to welcome "May Day" and the Seventh National Labor Congress. The model workers of the Shuangcheng County Department Store in Songjiang Province pledged to promote the card sales method and complete 45% of the annual commodity turnover plan in the second quarter to welcome "May Day" and the Seventh National Labor Congress. The workers of the Northeast Beipiao Mining Bureau launched a competition by discussing the production plan. The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant, ironmaking plant, and refractory brick plant also launched a competition. Other factories in the city are brewing to launch a competition. The workers of the Lüda Aquatic Products Company launched a competition after signing a collective contract on March 11.
    Workers in Tianjin State-owned Cotton Textile Factories No. 2, 4, and 6 have also launched a patriotic labor competition to welcome "May Day" International Labor Day and the Seventh National Labor Congress. Wang Deshan's team from the old cloth factory of State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 2 challenged workers throughout the factory, guaranteeing that in addition to completing the national production task, they would produce another 4,500 bolts of cloth from April to the end of the year. They also proposed to earnestly implement the 1951 weaving method, do a good job in safety and sanitation, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. After Wang Deshan's team proposed the challenge conditions, workers in various branch factories responded one after another.
    In Chengdu, workers are launching a competition to welcome "May Day" and the Seventh National Labor Congress. So far, 21 factories and 330 teams in the city have participated in the competition, with a total of 4,523 participating workers. Some factories in Chongqing have also launched competitions, and other factories are brewing to launch competitions. On March 3, the Kunming Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting of representatives of advanced production teams in the city. At the meeting, the representatives expressed that they would widely launch competitions, guarantee product quality, ensure safe production, and strive to comprehensively complete production tasks to welcome "May Day" and the Seventh National Labor Congress.
    The workers of state-owned factories in Wuxi are checking and revising their patriotic covenants in connection with production reforms. They are taking practical actions to improve production and welcome "May Day" and the Seventh National Labor Congress.
