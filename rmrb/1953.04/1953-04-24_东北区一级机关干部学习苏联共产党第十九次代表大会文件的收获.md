Gains from Studying the Documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union by First-Level Cadres in the Northeast Region

Seven hundred and sixteen senior cadres and more than 49,100 middle and junior-level cadres from first-level agencies in the Northeast region have diligently studied the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. According to the inspections by the Party committees of various agencies and the feedback from participants, the study has yielded significant results. In particular, the learning achievements among the leading cadres of first-level agencies in the Northeast were more prominent, and their understanding of many issues was enhanced.

First, regarding the understanding of the international situation. Many comrades, through this study, have further realized that to correctly understand the international situation, it is necessary to conduct a scientific analysis of the current situation from a fundamental perspective and raise it to the level of theory. Only in this way can we change from being blind to being conscious in our understanding of international issues; and only in this way can we avoid deviations and errors in our work due to a vague understanding of the situation. For example, some comrades in the Northeast Daily previously believed that the contradictions between imperialists were merely dog-eat-dog and of little significance, while others did not have a sufficient understanding of the role of the peace movement, thus affecting the newspaper's propaganda on the contradictions between imperialists and the peace movement. In this study, not only were these ideas examined and understanding enhanced, but also the newspaper's propaganda policy and practices were further studied, thereby improving the newspaper's work. From the further understanding of the international situation, confidence in the country's economic construction was also strengthened. There was a clearer understanding of why we were able to carry out large-scale economic construction while resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and thus a clearer recognition of the importance of propaganda on economic construction. In addition, the study of international situation issues promoted many cadres to care about international issues and began to cultivate the habit of paying attention to international news.

Second, regarding the understanding of industrial production. Many cadres, especially those leading industrial production, after studying the part of Malenkov's report on industry, generally gained a clearer understanding of the large-scale economic construction currently being carried out in our country. The understanding of many issues in industrial production has been improved, such as: (1) Understanding the importance of balanced production. In the past, many comrades were satisfied with the new records of individual workshops and individual groups, and some comrades also felt that it was important to carry out balanced production; but because the former's achievements were easy to see, while the latter's achievements could not be seen in a short period of time, in practice they still focused on and were interested in the former. After this study, there was a deeper understanding of balanced production from a theoretical perspective. Everyone also examined the fact that although many new records had appeared in individual workshops and groups in some factories, these new records did not improve production due to unbalanced production. This made everyone's understanding of the importance of balanced production clearer.

(2) Regarding the important significance of improving labor productivity and how to improve labor productivity. In the past, the improvement of labor productivity was mostly considered only from the perspective of improving technology. Comprehensive consideration from improving technology, improving labor organization, and increasing machinery and equipment was relatively poor. As a result, some enterprises increased their products, and their number of employees also increased, resulting in very little or no reduction in costs. For example, a coal mine added coal-turning machines, and simultaneously carried out coal-turning, soil-turning, and stone-turning, so that the same coal-turning machine had three shifts of people waiting to use it at the same time. For example, a coal mine used a combine to mine coal, but still used the old method to transport coal, so a lot of coal was accumulated in the pit and could not be produced. After studying Malenkov's report and examining these situations, everyone had a clearer and more profound understanding of improving labor productivity, and overcame the one-sided viewpoint in considering this issue in the past. Secondly, some units put forward the goal of increasing labor productivity by a certain amount every year, but only put it forward as an indicator, lacking specific measures to complete such an indicator, and to a large extent let it increase spontaneously. After this study, this phenomenon was criticized, and the understanding was deepened ideologically.

(3) Understanding the importance of practicing strict economy. In the past, more consideration was given to economy, and less consideration was given to a comprehensive or active perspective. When discussing the issue of economy, the Local Industry Bureau conducted a relatively comprehensive inspection of the product quality, working hours, consumption quotas, personnel quotas, machine maintenance, raw material waste, and the distance between factories and raw material producing areas of the factories it led, and therefore had a more comprehensive understanding of how to carry out economy than in the past.

Because the deviations in understanding of some of the above issues were corrected, and the shortcomings existing in the work were examined. In the past, some comrades had a one-sided view of only paying attention to the achievements of industrial production in the Northeast and ignoring its shortcomings, and the complacency arising therefrom was also fundamentally overcome and corrected. It was recognized that there are still many serious shortcomings in our work, and it is urgently needed to be improved.

Third, regarding the understanding of agricultural production. The biggest gain in understanding of some comrades who lead agricultural work after studying Malenkov's report is that they have strengthened their emphasis on the production practice of the masses, criticized the erroneous attitude of not seriously studying the masses' experience in high yield, and exposed and criticized the erroneous tendency of only studying Michurin's theory in words but actually engaging in Mendel's theory, resulting in the separation of agricultural science from practice and from the masses. Many comrades have a clearer understanding that agricultural science must be combined with the production practice of the broad masses, and that we must attach importance to summarizing and promoting the experience of the masses in high yield so as to raise it to a scientific level. In the understanding of leading agriculture, also because of studying Malenkov's report, combined with the actual situation of agricultural work in the Northeast, the erroneous practice of using "average indicators to judge and guide agriculture" was criticized, and it was recognized that it is necessary to seriously study the highest and lowest yields in various regions and pay attention to exploring the potential of agricultural production. Due to the improvement in the understanding of these issues, there is also a deeper understanding of promoting high-yield experience (such as promoting the high-yield experience of Zhaoyuan County) and of exploring the potential of agricultural production in the Northeast, and thus these cadres' confidence in completing the Northeast's agricultural production plan for the next five years has been enhanced.

Fourth, in terms of financial and economic work, such as the cadres of the Ministry of Finance, after this study, recognized the past bias of only emphasizing the profit delivery of state-owned enterprises and insufficient attention to production. Specifically, only the performance of profit delivery was used to evaluate the quality of state-owned enterprises, and the inspection of the business management and actual profit of different enterprises was ignored. As a result, the bad style of some enterprises making departmentalism and ambushing to affect production was not timely emphasized, and the necessary care was not given to enterprises with real difficulties. After study, the cadres of the department have a new understanding of the relationship between financial work and development of production, the position of financial work in economic construction, and clearly recognized the great significance of adhering to principles in the work, fighting against all phenomena that endanger national interests, carrying out financial management correctly from the perspective of promoting production, supporting enterprises that should be supported, and improving the work style of cadres. In the study, the cadres of the department also studied the situation of national fiscal revenue and basic construction investment, further recognized the significance of strengthening the supervision of state-owned enterprises, found the key points for implementing supervision of basic construction, and clearly recognized the direction of future work.

Fifth, on the issue of literature and art: Malenkov's proposal that "we must boldly express the contradictions and conflicts of life" has solved a major problem for comrades engaged in literary and artistic work, not only in theory but also in actual creative activities. The solution of this problem has corrected and enriched the understanding of socialist realism, understood how to observe things comprehensively and deeply in order to grasp the essence of real life, thus also clarified how to correctly shape artistic images and overcome the tendency of conceptualization, and improved the confidence and courage of creation, and eliminated some erroneous concerns in the past in creative activities. When studying this part of Malenkov's report, many comrades re-studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," examined the study and understanding of Chairman Mao's work in the past, and found that their understanding was superficial and one-sided.

In addition to the above gains, through this study, many cadres also felt their lack of theoretical foundation, especially the knowledge of political economy, and felt the necessity of obtaining this knowledge. Therefore, in this study, many comrades proposed to study political economy. This has created good conditions for carrying out theoretical study in the future.

There are still many shortcomings in this study, the main ones being: (1) The plan and requirements for the study are not specific and clear enough: The vast majority of units' study plans are not thorough enough, and they have not clearly put forward what problems to solve and what goals to achieve based on the content of the documents and the situation of the cadres. (2) There are some biases in the learning methods: such as starting from concepts without conducting specific analysis. Or, they did not understand the documents themselves well, and even did not understand the concepts, so they "linked to reality" indiscriminately, causing ideological confusion. Another is that there is too little reading time and too much discussion time. For example, the Ministry of Finance spent only one-third of the time reading and two-thirds of the time discussing, so individuals did not study carefully, and the discussion meetings were poorly prepared or not prepared at all. As a result, the discussion meetings became aimless chats, wasting a lot of time. (3) In terms of organizational leadership, the existing shortcomings are: each unit lacks supervision and inspection of the study of leading cadres. The Party committees and branches of the first-level units in the Northeast only supervise and inspect the study of the middle and junior groups, and do not care about or rarely care about the senior groups. In some units (such as the Ministry of Culture), the organization of senior groups is not sound, and there is a lack of study discipline. There are also individual units (such as the Northeast People's Art Theater) that have relaxed or even abandoned the study due to frequent emergency work; some units (such as the Ministry of Health) have simply cancelled the senior groups. These problems must be solved in the future.

    东北区一级机关干部学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件的收获
    东北区一级各机关高级干部七百一十六人，中、初级组干部四万九千一百多人，认真地学习了联共第十九次代表大会的文件。根据各机关党委的检查及参加学习者的反映，这次学习收获很大。特别是在东北一级机关的领导干部中，学习成绩更为显著，在不少问题上都提高了认识。
    首先，对国际形势的认识。许多同志通过这次学习，进一步认识到：要正确了解国际形势，必须对时局从根本上进行科学的分析，提高到理论上来认识。只有这样，才能在国际问题的认识上，从盲目变为自觉；也只有这样才不致因对形势认识模糊而在工作上发生偏差和错误。例如东北日报有些同志过去认为帝国主义之间的矛盾不过是狗咬狗，意义不大，有些同志对和平运动的作用没有足够的认识，因此影响到报纸对帝国主义之间的矛盾的宣传和和平运动的宣传不够有力。在这次学习中不但检讨了这些思想，提高了认识，而且进一步研究了报纸宣传的方针和作法，从而改进了报纸工作。从对国际形势的进一步认识中也加强了对祖国经济建设的信心，对于我们为什么能够一面抗美援朝一面进行大规模的经济建设，有了更清楚的了解，因而也更明确认识了对经济建设宣传的重要。另外通过对国际形势问题的学习，推动了许多干部关心国际问题，并开始养成了注意国际消息的习惯。
    其次，对工业生产的认识。许多干部特别是领导工业的干部，在学习了马林科夫报告中关于工业的部分后，普遍对我国目前进行的大规模经济建设有了更加清楚的认识，对于工业生产上许多问题的了解，提高了一步，如：（一）对均衡生产的重要意义的认识。过去许多同志满足于个别车间、个别小组的新纪录，有的同志也感到进行均衡生产的重要；但由于前者的成绩容易看出，而后者的成绩则不是短时间所可看到的，因而在实际上仍然是着眼并感兴趣于前者。经过这次学习，对均衡生产从理论上有了更深的了解，大家并检查了一些工厂虽然在个别车间与小组出现了许多新纪录，但由于生产不均衡，这些新纪录并没有使生产提高。这就使大家对均衡生产的重要性，认识更加明确了。
    （二）关于提高劳动生产率的重要意义及如何提高劳动生产率问题。在过去，对于劳动生产率的提高，大多只着重从提高技术方面考虑，从提高技术、改进劳动组织、增加机器设备等各方面进行全面的考虑则比较差，因而有的企业产品增加了，随着人数也增加了，致成本降低很少，甚至根本没降低。如某煤矿添增翻煤机，同时进行翻煤、翻土、翻石头，因而同一翻煤机就有三班人同时在等着用，再如某煤矿以康拜因挖煤，但仍用旧办法运煤，因此坑内积压很多煤，无法进行生产。学习了马林科夫的报告，检查了这些情况，大家对提高劳动生产率都有了比较明确而深刻的认识，克服了过去在考虑这一问题的片面观点。其次，有些单位每年都提出要提高劳动生产率多少，但只是作为一个指标提了出来，缺乏完成这样一个指标的具体措施，在很大程度上是让其自流地提高。经过这次学习，这种现象也受到了批判，并从思想上加深了认识。
        （三）对厉行节约的重要意义的认识。过去在节约方面考虑的多一些，很少从全面或积极方面考虑。地方工业管理局在讨论节约问题时，对其所领导的工厂的产品质量、工时、消耗定额、人员定额、机器保养、原料的浪费和工厂与原料产地的远近等进行了比较全面的检查，因而对于如何进行节约，较过去认识的更全面了。
    由于纠正了上面一些问题认识上的偏差，检查了工作中所存在的缺点。过去有一些同志只注意东北工业生产方面的成绩而忽视其缺点的片面观点，以及由此而产生的自满的思想，也从根本上得到了克服和纠正，认识到我们的工作还存在着不少严重缺点，还亟须努力改进。
    第三，对农业生产的认识。领导农业工作的一些同志学了马林科夫的报告后，在认识上的最大收获是加强了对群众生产实践的重视，批判了对群众丰产经验不加认真研究的错误态度，揭露并批判了过去只在口头上钻研米丘林学说，实际上却搞的是孟德尔一套，产生了使农业科学脱离实际脱离群众的错误倾向。对农业科学必须与广大群众生产实践相结合，并重视总结与推广群众丰产经验，以便使之提高到科学的水平，许多同志也有了更加明确的认识。在领导农业的认识上，也因学习马林科夫的报告，结合东北农业工作的实际，批判了用“平均指标来判断和指导农业”的错误作法，认识到必须认真研究各地区最高产量和最低产量，注意挖掘农业生产的潜力。由于在这些问题上认识的提高，对推广丰产经验（比如推广肇源县的丰产经验），对挖掘东北农业生产的潜力，也有了较深刻的了解，并从而增强了这些干部对完成今后五年东北农业生产计划的信心。
    第四，在财经工作方面，如财政部的干部，经过这次学习认识了过去对国营企业只强调上缴利润而对生产重视不足的偏向。具体表现在：只简单地从上缴利润的表现上去评价国营企业的好坏，忽视了对不同企业的经营管理与实际利润的检查，因而对某些企业闹本位打埋伏影响生产的恶劣作风未能及时地加以重视，对确有困难的企业没有加以必要的照顾。经过学习，该部干部对财政工作与发展生产的关系，财政工作在经济建设中的地位，有了新的认识，明确地认识了在工作中坚持原则，与一切危害国家利益的现象作斗争，从推进生产的观点出发正确地进行财政管理，扶持应该扶持的企业与改进干部工作作风的巨大意义。该部干部在学习中并研究了国家财政收入与基本建设投资的状况，进一步认识了对国营企业加强监督的意义，找到了对基本建设施行监督的重点，明确认识了今后的工作方向。
    第五，在文艺问题上：马林科夫提出的“必须大胆地表现生活的矛盾和冲突”，对于从事文艺工作的同志，不仅是在理论上而且在实际的创作活动中，解决了一个重大问题。这个问题的解决，端正并丰富了对社会主义现实主义的理解，懂得了如何全面地深刻地观察事物以抓住现实生活的本质，从而也弄清了应如何正确地去塑造艺术的形象及克服概念化的倾向，并提高了创作的信心和勇气，消除了过去在创作活动中一些错误的顾虑。许多同志在学习马林科夫报告中的这一部分时，又重新温习了毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，检查了过去对毛主席这一著作的学习和认识，发现自己理解的肤浅和片面。
    除了上面的收获外，通过这次学习，不少干部还感到自己理论基础特别是政治经济学知识的缺乏，并感觉到获得这些知识的必要，因此在这次学习中有许多同志提出要学习政治经济学。这给今后开展理论学习创造了良好的条件。
    这次学习还存在着许多缺点，主要的是：（一）学习的计划和要求不够具体、明确：绝大多数单位学习的计划都订得不够周密，都没有根据文件内容及干部的情况，明确提出要解决什么问题，达到什么目的。（二）学习方法上存在着一些偏向：如从概念出发，不进行具体的分析。或者是对文件本身没有很好地体会，甚至概念都没有弄清，就去“联系实际”，因而乱联一气，造成思想混乱。还有一种是阅读时间太少讨论时间太多。例如财政部阅读时间只占三分之一，讨论时间占去了三分之二，因而个人的研读不精，讨论会的准备不足或根本没有准备，结果讨论会变成了漫无中心的漫谈，浪费不少时间。（三）在组织领导上，存在的缺点是：各单位对领导干部的学习缺乏督促检查，东北一级机关单位的党委和支部，只是督促检查中级组和初级组的学习，不过问或很少过问高级组。有些单位（如文化部）高级组的学习，组织上不健全，缺乏学习纪律。还有个别单位（如东北人民艺术剧院）因经常突击工作，放松以至放弃了学习；有的单位（如卫生部）高级组等于取消了。这些问题都须在今后注意解决。
