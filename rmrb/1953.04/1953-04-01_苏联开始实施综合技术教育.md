Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 31st: According to TASS, the Minister of Education of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), Ivan Kairov, delivered a report on the tasks of Moscow schools and further improvement work at a conference of advanced educators in Moscow attended by over two thousand people on the 28th. In his report, he discussed the issue of implementing comprehensive technical education, one of the tasks indicated by Stalin for the transition to communism. Kairov said that Soviet educators are enthusiastically responding to the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to transition major cities to universal secondary education and begin implementing comprehensive technical education by the end of the current Five-Year Plan. Implementing comprehensive technical education in ordinary schools involves not only enabling students to master the basic knowledge of science but also enabling them to truly apply these sciences to industry and agriculture. Students should have some understanding of modern production and should develop the necessary habits for their future practical participation in work. Many schools in Moscow have already begun implementing comprehensive technical education this academic year. They have gained some experience in implementing comprehensive technical education in physics, chemistry, and biology, such as guiding senior students in making models of hydroelectric power stations, automatic mobile excavators, chemical plants, etc. Staff from the RSFSR Ministry of Education and the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences are drafting measures to improve Soviet ordinary schools based on the implementation of comprehensive technical education. The school curriculum is being revised, and specific hours are stipulated for participating in practical work and visiting enterprises. To implement comprehensive technical education, new textbooks will be published soon, and special study rooms and laboratories, workshops, and technical research rooms will be built.

    苏联开始实施综合技术教育
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联俄罗斯联邦教育部部长伊凡·凯罗夫二十八日在二千多人参加的莫斯科先进教育工作者大会上作了关于莫斯科学校的任务和进一步改进工作的报告。他在报告里谈到斯大林指示的为了过渡到共产主义所要做的工作之一——实施综合技术教育的问题。凯罗夫说，苏联教育工作者热烈地响应苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决议，要在目前这个五年计划终了时使各大城市过渡到普及中等教育而且要开始实施综合技术教育。在普通学校实施综合技术教育，不仅在于使学生掌握科学的基本知识，而且在于使学生真正能够把这些科学应用到工农业中去。学生应该对现代的生产有所了解，并且应该养成他们将来实际参加工作时必要的习惯。莫斯科有许多学校本学年已经开始实施综合技术教育。它们在物理、化学和生物学方面实施综合技术教育已经取得了一些经验，例如指导高年级学生做了水电站、自动移动挖掘机、化学工厂等的模型等，俄罗斯联邦教育部和教育科学院的工作人员，正在拟订在实施综合技术教育的基础上改善苏联普通学校的措施。学校课程表正在加以修改，并特别规定了参加实际工作和参观企业的钟点。为了实施综合技术教育，新教科书即将出版，特别的学习室和实验室、工场和技术研究室即将建设起来。
