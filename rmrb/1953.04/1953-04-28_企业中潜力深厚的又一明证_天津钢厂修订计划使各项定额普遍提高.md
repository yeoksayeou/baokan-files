Another Powerful Proof of Deep Potential Within Enterprises
    Tianjin Steel Plant Revises Plan, Universally Raising Various Norms
    The Tianjin Steel Plant, whose original production plan was already relatively advanced, further mobilized the masses to tap the potential within the enterprise again, and various technical and economic norms have been universally raised a step further.
    The 1953 production plan of Tianjin Steel Plant was formulated through mass discussions in November of last year. At that time, the workers raised more than 800 rationalization proposals centering on key production issues, and the planned total annual output value exceeded the state control figure by 16.3 percent, labor productivity increased by 18.5 percent compared to the previous year, and total costs decreased by 7.75 percent.
    In order to complete this plan, all the plant's employees made very strenuous efforts in the first quarter of this year and took many measures. They vigorously promoted various advanced experiences. The open-hearth furnace workshop learned the Soviet rapid steelmaking method, which shortened the open-hearth smelting time by 3.35 percent and increased the utilization coefficient by 4.58 percent. The wire rod department promoted the Xiao Changqing work method, which improved product quality to 100 percent. The Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League learned from the experience of Factory 53, strengthened leadership over production, paid attention to organizing balanced production according to the work plan, and initially overcame the historical phenomenon of being slack at the beginning and tight at the end; in the process of implementing the plan, they constantly mobilized the masses, organized forces, and overcame new weak links; in addition, they also solved twelve major safety problems that had long threatened the safety and health of workers, and improved the workers' enthusiasm for production. In particular, thorough propaganda was carried out among the workers about the significance of the plant's production for the country's large-scale construction, and a strong sense of planning was established in the minds of the employees, which played a decisive role in completing the plan. The workers said, "The national plan was made by ourselves, and we must complete it no matter what." Therefore, in the first quarter, the national plan was basically completed in a balanced and comprehensive manner on a monthly basis, and serious injuries were eliminated.
    Precisely because this year's plan was relatively advanced, and the completion of the first quarter's plan was quite tense, some ideological obstacles were encountered when the employees were mobilized again in April to discuss the revision of the plan. The open-hearth furnace workers said, "Our current plan is realistic, neither conservative nor adventurous." Some cadres also believed, "This revision of the plan is a waste of effort, there won't be much to gain. Last time we formulated the plan, we found almost all the tricks." Some individual workers, due to some accidents in the first quarter, lost confidence in the revision of the plan and even requested to lower the norms. On the other hand, some people had blindly optimistic feelings, saying, "Last time the quotas were raised so much, and they were all completed; this time we can raise them fiercely." These people were very enthusiastic, but had no specific methods. In response to this situation, the plant's leading cadres first conducted ideological education work, pointing out the situation of completing the plan in the first quarter, explaining that the potential of the plant was still very large; at the same time, they also pointed out that it was wrong to be blindly optimistic based solely on enthusiasm,
    It is necessary to carefully calculate accounts, find tricks, and raise quotas based on evidence. Then, the following series of detailed work was carried out:
        1. Conduct specific investigations into the actual ability to complete the quotas, study the possibility of increasing output and quality quotas and reducing cost quotas. All departments and workshops have carefully analyzed the original records of the first quarter and made detailed calculations to grasp the situation. In this way, when mobilizing the masses for discussion, the leadership had full confidence to oppose conservative ideas. For example, before discussing the steel ingot burnout rate, the records of the first quarter were studied, and it was found that the lowest damage rate of one shift reached 28 kilograms, which was generally lower than the planned number (48 kilograms). Therefore, the leadership had a basis to change the quota to 35 kilograms. This item alone can reduce costs by 1.3 billion yuan throughout the year. In this way, before the mass discussion, tips for increasing production and saving tens of billions of yuan had already been found, which increased the confidence of leading cadres and the masses in revising the plan.
    2. Analyze the requirements of the national plan and summarize the work of the first quarter, and respectively identify the key issues of the entire plant and the workshops, work sections, and teams, and mobilize the masses to discuss and propose specific technical and organizational measures around these key issues. For example, the output plan of the open-hearth furnace workshop in the first quarter was completed very tightly, and the smelting time per furnace was very long. Therefore, the key issue of the open-hearth furnace workshop was to shorten the smelting time per furnace to increase output. The quality of the open-hearth furnace workshop could not meet the plan requirements, mainly because of sand inclusion and uneven surfaces, which should be solved by the casting work section. Therefore, the key to the casting work section was to eliminate sand inclusion and uneven surfaces in steel ingots. In this way, each workshop, work section, and team, according to different situations, put forward their respective key issues, and the masses discussed and searched for solutions, and then the technical department studied and analyzed and formulated a technical and organizational measure plan, so that the realization of the future plan could be effectively guaranteed.
    3. When mobilizing the masses for discussion, pay attention to publicizing and promoting the advanced plan and advanced thinking of Wei Yuxi of Jinxi Chemical Plant, which played a great role in promoting the discussion of the plan. For example, a master worker in the General Machinery Section learned from Wei Yuxi's advanced experience, prepared materials and tools before work, and changed the past phenomenon of using materials and grabbing tools on the spot, which delayed production, so that the quota was doubled. In the past, the highest monthly output of the steelmaking lime kiln was nine kilns, and the plan was twelve kilns. Cui Si, a member of the Communist Youth League, under the influence of Wei Yuxi's pioneering spirit, carefully studied the past production situation, thought of improvement methods, and proposed a quota of 15 kilns per month. At the beginning, the masses did not agree with this quota, but after he introduced the improvement methods in detail, he immediately won the support and adoption of the masses. At this time, the leaders of the factory seized the opportunity to publicize these advanced figures and advanced ideas, and promoted the work of planning the entire factory.
    In addition, organizing the staff of the sections to go to the workshops also played a great role in helping workers revise the plan and strengthening future plan management.
    The plan revised this time is a step further than the original plan. The total output of the open-hearth furnace has increased by 5.6 percent, the output of small rolling mills has increased by 10 percent, the qualified rate of steel bars has increased by 1 percent, and the burnout rate per ton of steel ingot has dropped from 48 kilograms to 33 kilograms. According to preliminary estimates of only a few major projects, costs can be reduced by another 5 billion yuan. Employees have newly proposed more than 500 tips, solving many key problems.
    At present, the plant is further improving the work plan and sorting out the original records on the basis of revising the plan, strengthening plan management, establishing and improving a series of production responsibility systems, and organizing workers to better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

    企业中潜力深厚的又一明证
    天津钢厂修订计划使各项定额普遍提高
    原订生产计划比较先进的天津钢厂，深入发动群众再次挖掘企业中的潜力，各项技术经济定额又普遍提高了一步。
    天津钢厂一九五三年的生产计划，是去年十一月发动群众讨论制订的。那时，职工们围绕着生产上的关键问题，提出了八百多件合理化建议，订出的全年生产总值超过了国家控制数字的百分之十六点三，劳动生产率较去年度提高百分之十八点五，总成本降低百分之七点七五。
    为了完成这个计划，全厂职工在今年第一季度中用了十分紧张的努力，采取了许多措施。他们大力推广了各种先进经验。平炉车间学习了苏联快速炼钢法，使平炉冶炼时间缩短了百分之三点三五，利用系数提高了百分之四点五八。线材部推广了萧长清工作法，使产品质量提高到百分之百。党、行政、工会、青年团学习五三工厂经验，加强了对生产的领导，注意按作业计划组织均衡生产，初步克服了历史性的前松后紧现象；在执行计划的过程中，不断地发动群众、组织力量，克服新的薄弱环节；此外，还解决了长年存在的严重威胁着工人安全和健康的十二件较大的安全问题，提高了工人的生产积极性。特别是在工人中透彻地宣传了本厂生产对国家大规模建设的意义，在职工思想中树立了强烈的计划观念，更对完成计划起了决定性的作用。工人们说：“国家计划是我们自己订的，说什么也得完成。”因此第一季度基本上做到了按月均衡地全面地完成了国家计划，并且消灭了重伤事故。
    正由于今年的计划比较先进，而且在完成第一季度计划时是相当的紧张，因此在四月份再度发动职工讨论修订计划时就碰到了一些思想障碍。平炉工人说：“咱们现在的计划就是现实的，既不保守也不冒险。”有的干部也认为：“这次修订计划白费劲，不会有大油水。上次订计划时，窍门找得差不多了。”个别工人由于第一季曾出了一些事故，对修订计划丧失信心，甚至要求降低定额。另一方面，有的人又有盲目乐观情绪，说：“上次定额提高这么多，也都完成了；这次可以狠狠地提高一下。”这些人热情很高，但是没有具体办法。针对这种情况，厂的领导干部首先进行了思想教育工作，指出第一季度完成计划的情况，说明厂里的潜在力依然是很大的；同时也指出单凭热情盲目乐观也是不对的，
    一定要算细帐、找窍门，有根据地提高定额。接着便进行了下面一系列的细致工作：
        一、具体调查完成定额的实际能力，研究提高产量、质量定额和降低成本定额的可能性，各科室和车间都详细分析了第一季度的原始记录，进行算细帐，掌握情况，这样，发动群众讨论时，领导方面就有了充分的把握来反对保守思想。如讨论钢锭烧损率之前，研究了第一季度的记录，发现损坏率最低的一个班曾达二十八公斤，一般的也低于计划数（四十八公斤），因此，领导上就有根据地把定额改成了三十五公斤。仅此一项，全年即可降低成本十三亿元。这样，在群众讨论之前，已经找出了可以增产节约数十亿元的窍门，增加了领导干部和群众修订计划的信心。
    二、分析国家计划的要求和总结第一季度的工作，分别找出全厂的和车间、工段、小组的关键问题，发动群众围绕这些关键问题讨论提出具体的技术组织措施。如平炉车间第一季度产量计划完成得很紧张，每炉冶炼的时间很长，因此平炉车间的关键问题就是缩短每炉熔炼时间以提高产量。平炉车间质量不能达到计划要求，主要是夹砂和表面不平，这个问题应由铸造工段解决。因此铸造工段的关键就是消灭钢锭夹砂和表面不平。这样，各个车间、工段、小组根据不同的情况提出各自的关键，由群众讨论找寻解决的窍门，然后由技术部门研究分析，订出技术组织措施计划，使今后计划的实现得到确实的保证。
    三、在发动群众讨论时，注意宣传推广锦西化工厂韦玉玺的先进计划、先进思想，对讨论计划起了很大的推动作用。如总机械科有一老师傅学习了韦玉玺的先进经验，在工作前准备好材料、工具，改变了过去现用现抓以致耽误生产的现象，使定额提高了一倍。炼钢白灰窑过去每月最高产量是九窑，计划是十二窑，青年团员崔四在韦玉玺首创精神的影响下，仔细钻研了过去的生产情况，想出了改进办法，提出了月产十五窑的定额。开始时群众不同意这个定额，经他详细介绍了改进办法后，当即获得了群众的支持与采纳。这时，厂的领导上即抓紧宣传这些先进人物先进思想，推动了全厂订计划的工作。
    此外，组织科室人员下车间，也对帮助工人修订计划，加强今后的计划管理起了很大作用。
    这次修订的计划，比原订计划又普遍提高了一步。平炉总产量提高了百分之五点六，小型轧钢机产量提高了百分之十，钢条合格率提高了百分之一，每吨钢锭烧损率由四十八公斤降到三十三公斤。仅就几项主要项目初步估计，即可再降低成本五十亿元。职工新提出的窍门有五百多个，解决了许多关键问题。
    目前该厂正在修订计划的基础上，进一步健全作业计划和整理原始记录，加强计划管理、建立和健全一系列的生产责任制，组织工人更好地学习苏联先进经验。
