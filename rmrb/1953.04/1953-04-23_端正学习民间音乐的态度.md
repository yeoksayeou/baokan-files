Correct Attitude Toward Learning Folk Music
Ma Ke

After seeing the First National Folk Music and Dance Performance, I gained a lot more perceptual knowledge about folk art, and I realized the authenticity of folk art's expression of life, as well as the richness of its forms and the ingenuity of its methods. This has enabled us to take a step forward in our understanding of folk art. At the same time, I also have this feeling: why are our new literary and artistic works so poor compared with folk art? What ideas are hindering us from further learning from folk art?

In the past, we always thought that folk art was a product of the old era, and that it was already "outdated." Today's new society demands new creations, and the "old" art cannot express today's reality at all; and it is best that new works should not be like the old in any way.

Can the relationship between "new life" and "old art" be understood in this way?

Of course, it is obviously wrong to completely replace today's new creations with old art. This is a conservative, lazy behavior. However, are the old art and today's new life completely insulated and unable to find any common ground?

From the programs of this performance, we can see that there are two situations in the relationship between inherent folk art and new real life: Some are old arts that express the people's lives in the old era and their ideals for life in a fairly perfect image. Although the era in which these works were produced has passed, the realistic spirit and optimistic and healthy emotions of these works are so close to us that when we hear them, we are deeply moved and educated, and they inspire our enthusiasm for life and work. Many programs in this performance, such as the instrumental music "Great Victory," "Great Gate," "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix," and the solo and chorus vocal music describing love and labor, such as "Yunnan Folk Song," "Qingpu Field Song," "Sichuan River Boatman's Chantey," etc. From the point of view of artistic effect, these programs are much higher than many of our generalized works. Another type of program, although produced in the old era, has been continuously developed with the pace of new life, and can even competently express today's new life. This is most obvious in some folk songs praising the leaders. The theme of praising the leaders should be said to be the most able to concentrate on expressing the new life and emotions of the people today, but these folk songs basically adopt the old tunes. In the programs of this performance, whether it is the "Miao Song" sung by A Pao or the Uighur songs sung by A Yimunisha and others, we can hardly feel any significant emotional restraint on these singers from the old folk tunes. We can also take the well-known "The East is Red" as an example. Today, it has almost become a typical song for the Chinese people to praise our wise leader, but it was originally a Shanxi folk song describing love. Of course, I am not saying that the songs praising the leaders should only remain at the level of "The East is Red" (it only simply writes out the people's love for the leaders, and does not successfully depict the image of the leaders), nor am I saying that all songs expressing new life can be replaced by filling old folk songs with new lyrics, but only to say that the old artistic heritage, especially folk art, still maintains an extremely close relationship with the new life and new art of the people today, and ignoring this relationship in any way will hinder the development of new art.

In the past, we were not ignorant of these issues in terms of rationality. Everyone seems to know the importance of inheriting heritage, and understands the preciousness of the people's nature and realism in the heritage, and no one has ever openly advocated refusing to learn from the heritage. However, a fundamental issue has not been clearly recognized, that is, the relationship between the source of people's art and our professional literary and art workers. The artistic creation of the people is like a torrential river, flowing out of the soil of life, converging into a huge current, rushing into the sea, never interrupted, never ceased. However, in our hearts, there are often two kinds of rivers: one is folk, they are "old," "low-level," and "simple"; the other is our own, they are "new," "high-level," and in line with "international standards." The relationship between these two rivers is also vague - sometimes it feels like they can "exchange" a bit, and sometimes they simply "mind their own business." In fact, the former is cancelled and only the latter is recognized. This not only blocks the source of folk art, but also suffocates new artistic creation.

In this issue, it is very instructive to often remember the Soviet experience. I remember that the Soviet musicians Churaki and Zakharov, who came to China during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" last year, repeatedly emphasized the source of people's artistic creation in their many speeches. They took the history of the development of Soviet revolutionary songs and Russian opera as an example to illustrate that all excellent works were created on the basis of absorbing foreign experience from the old folk music. For example, there are two types of Russian folk songs: one is rhythmically long, expressing the boundless Russian grasslands, the painful life of the people, and the serious and brave character of the people. This type of song has developed into a new chorus that describes the solemn struggle, lyricism, and love for the motherland today. The other is rhythmically jumping, expressing the victory of the people's struggle and the mood of jubilation and encouragement. This type of folk song has developed into soldiers' songs, and in the years of the upsurge of the 1905 and 1917 revolutions, it developed into revolutionary struggle songs and Red Army songs. This development is the natural trend of the development of people's art. Great composers only follow this trend, understand the needs of the people, and add their own hard work on the basis of the people's creation. Without these specific historical conditions, the writer's talent cannot be expressed. In the development of folk songs in our country, there are also extremely similar examples: during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, there was a lack of a large number of professional new literary and art workers in the revolutionary base areas, but the revolutionary people, in order to express the fiery struggle life at that time, adapted many old folk songs to sing (such as the Jiangxi Xingguo mountain songs sung in the Central South District this time). Don't think that this is just a simple adaptation. Because they are trying to meet the requirements of the new life and emotional requirements, the old folk songs are in fact undergoing significant changes, and the more turbulent the revolutionary life is, the more significant this change is. I once imagined that if we did not have Nie Er, Xian Xinghai and a large number of professional musicians participating later, would this change continue, and would some experts be directly produced from the folk? - I think it will. But this assumption is naturally untenable, because in fact we have inherited the tradition of revolutionary people's music, and developed it to a higher stage. Without professional musicians, the high development of people's music is naturally unimaginable; but what can professional musicians do without the musical tradition of the people? But these experiences are not always clearly imprinted in our minds. We do not have enough excavation and research on the musical tradition of the people. Here I would like to recall what Comrade Churaki said when talking about the impression of Chinese music [Note]. He said: "There is a wall between the works of Chinese composers and Chinese folk songs and operas, and there are not many points of contact between each other. This disconnection should be eliminated quickly, and there should not be two cultures. Chinese musicians should collect and study folk music very well, and there is no doubt that they can find many living and useful components in it today (naturally there are also dead components); many progressive and useful components can also be found in the works of other countries. Chinese musicians are faced with a glorious and great task: to thoroughly understand folk art, to study the art of other countries, in order to develop China's new art." These words are very profound.

In addition, I think that what hinders us from learning better from folk music is also an incorrect view of "technology."

In the past, we often thought that the benefits of folk art were only the health of thoughts and feelings, and that the expression methods and techniques were "inferior," and even not worth mentioning "art." This view, first of all, regards the expression methods of folk art and the content of life expressed as things that can be arbitrarily divided, so the improvement of folk art is simplified to just a technical processing problem; and this technical processing is often unilaterally understood as only Western skills can be competent. As a result, some imitations that are only carved in form are produced, becoming nondescript things. This is a problem that many vocalists have failed to solve for a long time in singing folk songs and composers in creating and adapting folk songs. Second, this view of technology is also based on a dogmatic understanding. There is no distinction here: which are the truly backward parts of folk art, and which parts, although they do not conform to certain laws of Western technology, have successfully expressed the life of the people, and are loved by the masses for their strong national characteristics. This technology should be learned and studied without any doubt. In measuring the technical level of folk art, there are two standards: one is the dogmatic "standard," and the other is the standard based on the depth of expression of life. Obviously, only the latter standard is correct.

Most of the programs in this performance have a high degree of technology, and most of the artists who master these technologies are expressing technology in order to express life more deeply and more vividly, rather than simply showing off technology. This unity of content and form is a prominent feature of folk art. We have heard many folk artists express rich changes in fingering and rhythm on simple instruments such as Suona and Sanxian, and subtle control of volume and timbre; we have heard many folk singers with those high-pitched and loud voices, sensitive sense of rhythm, natural and beautiful vocal decorations, and the simple, kind, and heroic emotions expressed through these things. There are many things here worth learning from us. The "Tea Picking Lantern" dance of the Jinjiang Cultural Troupe and the "Yunnan Folk Song" performance of Comrade Huang Hong in the Southwest District have already made a good start in this regard.

In the future, we must clearly recognize the source of the development of the people's art and the position we are in; change the erroneous purely technical view that despises folk art; and at the same time, when learning from folk art, we should not only stay at the level of pure technical imitation. As long as we overcome these ideological obstacles, I believe that the people's music and art undertakings can be further developed and improved.

[Note] These words were said by Comrade Churaki at the welcome meeting of the East China Branch of the Central Conservatory of Music (he listened to a small performance by the students of the Conservatory of Music at this meeting). The text quoted here is my personal record. If there is any discrepancy with the original meaning, I will be responsible.

    端正学习民间音乐的态度
    马可
    看了第一届全国民间音乐舞蹈会演以后，我增加了对民间艺术的许多感性知识，体会到民间艺术表现生活的真实性以及表现形式的丰富和表现方法的精巧，这使得我们对民间艺术的认识提高了一步。同时我也有这样的感想：为什么我们新的文艺作品与民间艺术比起来这样的贫乏？什么思想阻碍着我们更进一步地向民间艺术学习呢？
    过去我们总以为民间艺术都是旧时代的产物，它们都已经“过时”了；今天的新社会要求新的创作，“旧”的艺术根本不能表现今天的现实生活；而新的作品最好在任何一点上都不要像旧的。
    对“新生活”与“旧艺术”的关系是可以这样来理解的吗？
    当然，全部以旧有的艺术来代替今天新的创作，很明显是不对的。这是一种保守的、懒汉的行为。但是，旧有的艺术与今天的新生活，难道是绝缘的，找不到任何相通之点的吗？
    从这次会演的节目中，可以看出在固有的民间艺术与新的现实生活的关系上，有着这样两种情形：有些是旧有的艺术以相当完美的形象表现了旧时代人民生活和他们对于生活的理想。产生这些作品的年代虽然已经过去了，但是这些作品的现实主义的精神和乐观的健康的情绪是这样与我们接近，以致当我们听到它们时，也深深地受到感动和教育，它们鼓舞了我们的生活与工作的热情。这次会演中的许多节目，如器乐曲的“大得胜” 、“大辕门”、“百鸟朝凤”，声乐曲中描写爱情与劳动的独唱和合唱，如“云南民歌”、“青浦田歌”、“川江船夫号子”等等都是。从艺术效果上来看，这类节目比我们创作的许多一般化的作品要高得多。另一种节目是虽然产生自旧的时代，但它随着新的生活的脚步已经有了不断的发展，甚至可以胜任地表现今天的新生活。这特别是在一些歌颂领袖的民歌中表现得最为明显。歌颂领袖的题材应该说是最能集中表现今天人民新的生活情感的了，但是这些民歌却都是基本上采取旧有的曲调。在这次会演的节目中，不论是阿泡唱的“苗歌”也好，阿依木尼沙等唱的维族歌曲也好，我们几乎感觉不到旧有的民歌曲调对于这些歌手在情感上有什么显著的束缚。我们还可以举大家熟知的“东方红”为例，它今天几乎变成全中国人民歌颂我们英明领袖的一首典型的歌曲了，但它原来也是一首描写爱情的山西民歌。自然，我不是说要把歌颂领袖的歌曲只停留在“东方红”的水平上（它只是朴素地写出了人民对领袖的敬爱，并没有成功地描绘出领袖的形象），也不是说一切表现新生活的歌曲都可以用旧民歌填新词来替代，而只是说旧有的艺术遗产，尤其是民间艺术与今天人民新的生活、新的艺术之间仍保持着极为密切的关系，在任何一点上忽视了这种关系，都将使新艺术的发展受到阻碍。
    我们过去在理性上也不是不认识这些问题。大家似乎都知道继承遗产的重要，也理解遗产中的人民性和现实主义之可贵，并且也从未有人公开主张拒绝向遗产学习。但是有一个根本问题没有十分明确地认识，那就是人民艺术的源流和我们专业的文艺工作者的关系。人民的艺术创造犹如滔滔江河，它从生活的土壤上流出来，汇成巨流，奔腾入海，永远没有间断，永远没有休止。可是在我们心中往往存在着两种河流：一种是民间的，它们是“旧”的、“低级”的、“简陋”的；一种是我们自己的，它们是“新”的、“高级”的、合乎“国际水平”的。这两种河流的关系又是模糊不清的——有时觉得可以“交流”一下，有时干脆“井水不犯河水”。实际上是取消了前者而只承认后者。这样既闭塞了民间艺术的源流，又窒息了新的艺术创作。
    在这个问题上，时常记取苏联的经验是大有教益的。记得去年“中苏友好月”来我国的苏联音乐家楚拉基和查哈罗夫等同志在他们多次的讲话中一再强调地提出人民艺术创造的源流问题。他们以苏联的革命歌曲与俄罗斯的歌剧发展的历史为例，说明所有优秀的作品都是从旧有的民间音乐的基础上吸收外来的经验而创造出来的。如俄罗斯的民歌原有两种类型：一种是节奏漫长的，表现俄罗斯的无边的草原、人民的痛苦生活以及人民严肃而勇敢的性格，这类歌曲发展成为今天描写庄严的斗争的、抒情的和热爱祖国的新的合唱。另一种是节奏跳荡的，表现出人民斗争的胜利和欢腾鼓舞的情绪，这类民歌发展成为士兵歌曲，在一九○五年和一九一七年革命高涨的年代发展成为革命斗争的歌曲和红军歌曲，这种发展是人民艺术发展的自然趋势。伟大的作曲家不过是顺应这个趋势，了解人民的要求，以人民的创造为基础而加上自己的辛勤劳动而已。离开了这些具体的历史条件，作家的天才是无从表现的。在我国的民歌发展上，恰好也有极为近似的例子：当第二次国内革命战争时期，在革命根据地内还缺少大量专业的新文艺工作者，但革命的人民为了表现当时火热的斗争生活，曾经改编了许多旧有的民歌来歌唱（如这次中南区演唱的江西兴国山歌）。你不要认为这只是简单的改编，由于力图符合新的生活情绪的要求，旧有的民歌事实上在起着显著的变化，而且越是在革命生活激荡的年代，这种变化越是显著。我曾经设想，假若我们没有聂耳、冼星海和以后大量专业的音乐工作者参加，这种变化是否会继续下去，而且将直接从民间产生一些专家呢？——我想一定会的。但这种设想自然是不成立的，因为事实上我们继承了革命的人民音乐的传统，而且把它发展到更高的阶段。没有专业的音乐工作者，人民音乐的高度发展自然是不能设想的；但离开了人民的音乐传统，专业的音乐工作者又能做些什么呢？但这些经验并不是经常清晰地印在我们脑子里。我们对于人民的音乐传统的发掘和研究非常不够。这里我想起楚拉基同志在谈到对中国音乐的印象时所讲的话〔注〕。他说：“中国作曲家的作品与中国民间歌曲和戏曲中间如隔一堵墙，相互间的接触点不多。这种脱节的现象应该很快地消灭，不应该有两种文化存在。中国的音乐家应该很好地去搜集、研究民间音乐，无疑问的从其中可以发现很多今天还活着的、有用的成分（自然也有僵死的成分）；在其他国家作品中同样也可发现许多进步的、有用的成分。在中国音乐家面前摆着一个光荣伟大的任务：彻底了解民间的艺术，研究其他国家的艺术，以发展中国的新艺术。”这些话是讲得非常深刻的。
    此外，我觉得阻碍我们向民间音乐更好地学习的，还有一种对“技术”的不正确的看法。
    我们过去常以为民间艺术的好处只是思想情感的健康，至于表现方法和技术则是“低劣”的，甚至谈不上“艺术”。这种看法，首先是把民间艺术的表现方法和所表现的生活内容看做是可以任意分割的东西，因之对民间艺术的提高简单化到只是技术上的加工问题；而这种技术的加工又常被片面理解为唯有西洋的技巧才能胜任。结果就产生了一些只是在形式上雕琢的摹制品，成为不伦不类的东西。这是许多声乐家在演唱民歌、作曲家在创作和改编民歌上所长期未能解决的问题。第二，这种对于技术的看法又是从一种教条主义的理解出发的。这里没有分辨出：哪些是民间艺术中真正落后的部分，哪些部分又是虽然不符合西洋技术的某些规律，但却成功地表现了人民的生活，并以其具有强烈的民族特点而为群众所热爱。这种技术应该毫不怀疑地去学习和研究。在衡量民间艺术的技术水平上，有两种标准：一种是教条主义的“标准”，一种是以表现生活的深度为根据的标准。显然，只有后一种标准是正确的。
    这次会演的大部分节目有着高度的技术，而掌握这些技术的艺人们大都是为着更深入、更形象化地去表现生活，而不是单纯为了炫耀技术才表现技术的。这种内容和形式的统一性，是民间艺术的显著特点。我们听到许多民间艺人在唢呐、三弦等简单的乐器上表现了指法、节奏的丰富变化，音量和音质的微妙的控制；我们听到许多民间歌手那些高吭嘹亮的声音，灵敏的节奏感、自然而美妙的声音装饰，以及通过这些东西表现出的朴实、亲切和豪迈的情绪。这里有很多东西是值得我们来学习的。晋江文工团的歌舞“采茶灯”，西南区黄虹同志的“云南民歌”演唱等节目已经在这方面有了很好的开端。
    我们今后一定要明确地认识人民的艺术发展的源流以及我们所处的地位；改变轻视民间艺术的错误的单纯技术观点；同时在向民间艺术学习时又不仅仅停留在单纯技术的模仿上。只要克服这些思想上的阻碍，我相信人民的音乐艺术事业能够进一步发展和提高。
    〔注〕这段话是楚拉基同志在中央音乐学院华东分院的欢迎会上谈的（在这会上他听了音乐学院同学的小型演奏），这里所引的文字是笔者个人的记录，如与原意有出入当由笔者负责。
