Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: Moscow Dispatch: Soviet workers in various regions are ardently launching socialist competitions, using new production achievements to greet the May 1st International Labor Day. The workers of Moscow are creating many brilliant achievements to welcome this great festival. Yu. Letunov, a young Stakhanovite lathe operator at the Lenin Factory, recently completed four shifts' work in four hours. When turning pump piston rods, he increased the feed from 0.3 cm to 1.2 cm while nearly doubling the number of revolutions. As a result, he turned out a piston rod in just five minutes, increasing output sevenfold while ensuring quality. Ye. Sichev, an installer at the Luberqi Silica Brick Factory, recently studied the working methods of a special molding machine and invented a device for automatically adjusting the height of silica bricks in the molding machine's mixer. After the factory adopted his suggestion, silica brick production increased by 12 to 14 percent. In Minsk, the workers of the Voroshilov Lathe Manufacturing Plant began implementing their socialist pledges to greet May Day as early as late March. Pi. Lesogor, an advanced worker in the plant's first mechanical workshop, consistently completes three times his quota. Lathe operator Yermokayevich increased the processing speed of hydraulic gantry planer shafts fourfold, while fitter Babeshko and others in the assembly shop reduced the labor time for processing and assembling tool holders by one-half to two-thirds. In the Urals, various factories have also launched vigorous May Day competitions. Leading the competition is the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant. In the first quarter of this year, the plant produced another automatic mobile excavator with a 14-cubic-meter bucket. Recently, a new machine designed by the plant, called the "Machine Blacksmith," can automatically transport a large 1,000-kilogram casting to the forging hammer in 15 to 20 minutes. New achievements are being created one after another within the plant. A. Gomziakov, an operator of a gear-cutting machine, consistently completes twice his quota, and the Morshansky installation team has halved the time required to produce electric excavator turntables. Now, all the workers in the plant have proposed a guarantee to overfulfill the four-month plan and to complete a new roughing mill before May 1st, and to manufacture an automatic mobile excavator with a 20-cubic-meter bucket before June 28th. In Leningrad, enterprises such as the Kozitsky Factory, the Red Metallurgist Factory, and the Progress Factory also started "May Day" work shifts as early as late March. The staff of the Red Dawn Factory also adopted new socialist pledges to complete the 1953 plan ahead of schedule and reduce the cost of producing equipment for automatic telephone exchanges. These guarantees are being successfully fulfilled. The urban automatic telephone exchange assembly workshop of the plant increased labor productivity by 10 to 15 percent in one week in March. At the Karl Marx Factory, which produces complex textile machines, Lazov and Grigory, drillers in the first mechanical workshop, consistently complete 250 percent of their assigned tasks. In Gorky City, the Gorky Automobile Factory is conducting a "May Day" competition. A steady stream of newly manufactured trucks is being delivered from the assembly line. Galkin's assembly team assembled more than 100 machines over the plan in March. Peterunin's team in the plant's second foundry shop completed the first quarter's production plan six days ahead of schedule.

    苏联工人迎接五一国际劳动节
    【新华社八日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联各地工人热烈展开社会主义竞赛，以新的生产成就迎接五一国际劳动节。莫斯科的工人们正在创造许多光辉的成就来迎接这个伟大的节日。列宁工厂青年斯塔哈诺夫式镟工尤·列图诺夫最近以四小时的时间做了四班工作。他在镟制唧筒活塞杆时，将走刀量从零点三公分增加到一点二公分，同时将转动次数差不多增加了一倍。结果五分钟就镟好一个活塞杆，产量提高了七倍，而且能保证质量。卢伯齐矽砖制造厂安装工人叶·西切夫最近研究了特别压型机的工作方法，发明了在压型机搅拌器中自动调节矽砖高度的器具。工厂在采用他的建议后，使矽砖产量增加了百分之十二到十四。在明斯克，伏罗希洛夫车床制造厂的工人早在三月下旬就已开始执行他们的迎接“五一”节的社会主义公约。该厂第一机械车间先进工人彼·雷索戈尔经常完成三倍定额，镟工叶尔莫凯耶维奇把水力龙门刨床轴加工速度提高了四倍，装配车间钳工巴别什科等则把刀架的加工和装配的劳动时间缩短了二分之一到三分之二。在乌拉尔，各个工厂也展开了蓬勃的“五一”竞赛。在竞赛中领先的是乌拉尔重型机械制造厂。今年第一季，该厂又生产了一台有十四立方公尺吊斗的自动移动挖掘机。最近该厂设计的一种名叫“机器铁匠”的新机器，可以自动在十五到二十分钟的时间里把一千公斤的大铸件送到炼锤下。新的成就正接二连三地在厂内创造出来，造齿机操使者阿·戈姆齐亚科夫经常完成两倍定额，安装工人莫尔尚斯基小组把生产电动挖掘机转台的时间缩短了一半。现在全厂工人们已提出了超额完成四个月计划的保证，要在五月一日以前提前完成一台新初轧机，在六月二十八日以前制成一台有二十立方公尺吊斗的自动移动挖掘机。在列宁格勒，科齐茨基工厂、红色冶金者工厂、前进工厂等企业也都早在三月下旬就开始了“五一”工作班。红色曙光工厂的工作人员并通过了新的社会主义公约，要提前完成一九五三年计划，减低生产自动电话站用器材的成本。这些保证都在顺利地完成着，该厂城市自动电话站装配车间在三月间的一个星期中就把劳动生产率提高了百分之十到十五。在生产复杂纺织机的卡尔·马克思工厂，第一机械车间钻工拉佐夫和格里戈里每人经常完成任务百分之二百五十。在高尔基城，高尔基汽车制造厂正在进行“五一”竞赛。输送装置源源不断地送出新制的卡车。装配工人加尔金的工作组在三月间超过计划多装配了一百多台机器。该厂第二翻砂车间的彼特鲁宁工作组提前六天完成了第一季度的生产计划。
