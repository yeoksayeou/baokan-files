Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 10th -- The powerful Korean-Chinese People's Anti-Aircraft Artillery Units and other air defense forces protecting the railways in northern Korea have achieved brilliant victories in air combat. From the end of December 1951 to the end of March this year, in fifteen months, they shot down a total of 295 enemy aircraft and damaged 864 enemy aircraft.

　　In the past year or more, the U.S. invading air force in Korea has carried out frantic bombing of the railways in northern Korea, vainly attempting to cut off the transportation lines of the Korean-Chinese People's Army. However, they have been severely attacked by our army's anti-aircraft artillery units. Our army's anti-aircraft artillery units have highly developed a brave and resourceful combat style, and have enriched their practical experience in frequent air combat.

　　Last spring, when the U.S. invading air force in Korea was conducting large-scale bombing of the railway lines in northern Korea, a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers shot down 33 enemy aircraft and damaged 150 enemy aircraft in a month and a half of continuous operations, using various ingenious tactics. Another anti-aircraft artillery unit in a certain area shot down nine enemy aircraft and damaged twenty-one enemy aircraft in one day of fierce fighting. During the week of January 9th to 15th this year, when more than 1,100 enemy aircraft sorties carried out concentrated bombing in a certain area, they also suffered severe blows from the Korean-Chinese ground anti-aircraft fire.

　　Our anti-aircraft artillery units also frequently gave powerful blows to enemy aircraft that sneaked in at night. The anti-aircraft artillery unit guarding an important river bridge, in close coordination with the searchlight unit, shot down and damaged eleven enemy aircraft. On one occasion, three enemy B-29 heavy bombers were shot down by our anti-aircraft fire in one night.

　　The heroic combat of the anti-aircraft artillery units has effectively protected the safety of the railway transportation lines in northern Korea. Now, the hit rate of enemy aircraft bombing the railway lines in northern Korea has been greatly reduced. Under the strong protection of the anti-aircraft artillery units, the Korean-Chinese People's Railway Engineering Corps is actively repairing the lines. This spring, the open railway lines in northern Korea have increased elevenfold compared to the winter of 1950, fully ensuring the transportation and supply of the Korean-Chinese People's Army.

    朝中防空部队在保护铁路线的战斗中
    十五个月打落打伤敌机一千多架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】保护朝鲜北部铁路线的强大的朝中人民高射炮部队和其他防空部队在对空作战中获得辉煌的胜利，从一九五一年十二月底到今年三月底的十五个月中，共计打落敌机二百九十五架，打伤敌机八百六十四架。
    在过去的一年多时间内，美国侵朝空军曾对朝鲜北部铁道进行了疯狂的轰炸，妄想切断朝中人民军队的运输线，但是，它们遭到了我军高射炮部队的严重打击。我军高射炮部队高度地发扬了英勇、机智的战斗作风，并在频繁的对空作战中丰富了自己的实战经验。
    去年春季，当美国侵朝空军对朝鲜北部的铁道线进行大规模的轰炸时，志愿军高射炮某部曾在一个半月的连续作战中，用各种巧妙的战术打落敌机三十三架，打伤敌机一百五十架。某地的另一支高射炮部队在一天的激战中就打落敌机九架，打伤敌机二十一架。在今年一月九日到十五日的一周间，一千一百多架次敌机在某地进行集中轰炸时，也遭到了朝中地面高射炮火的严重打击。
    我军高射炮部队并经常给予在夜间偷袭的敌机以有力的打击。守卫某重要江桥的高射炮部队在探照灯部队的密切配合下，曾先后打落打伤敌机十一架。有一次，在一个夜间就有三架敌B二十九型重轰炸机被我高射炮火打落下来。
    高射炮部队的英勇战斗，有力地保护了朝鲜北部铁道运输线的安全。现在，敌机向朝鲜北部铁路线投弹轰炸的命中率，已经大大减少了。在高射炮部队坚强的保护下，朝中人民铁道工程部队积极修复线路，今年春季朝鲜北部铁道的通车线路已经比一九五零年冬季增加了十一倍，使朝中人民部队的运输供应得到了充分的保证。
