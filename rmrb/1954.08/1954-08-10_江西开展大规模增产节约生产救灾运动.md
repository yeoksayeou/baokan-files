Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 7th: A large-scale production increase and thrift, disaster relief campaign is being launched in the vast rural areas of Jiangxi Province. The goal of this campaign is to strive to complete the original annual agricultural production increase plan for the entire province, even with some areas along the river and around the lake suffering from floods.

In the nearly ten days since the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions in late July, most counties throughout the province have quickly convened emergency meetings of the County Party Committees, and held joint conferences of district Party secretaries and district heads in concentrated or separate sessions. They have made specific arrangements for increasing production and practicing economy for disaster relief, and have carried out mobilization. In the vast non-disaster areas, these emergency meetings, in addition to proposing to ensure the completion of the original annual production increase plan, also started from analyzing the specific situation of the locality and put forward additional production increase plans. The CCP Ji'an Local Committee decided to raise the original plan for the entire region to increase production by 7% to an increase of 10%. In this new production increase plan, the promotion of ratooning rice alone can increase rice production by 120 million catties. In the counties along the river and around the lake that have suffered from floods, plans have also been proposed to strive to maintain the actual output of 1953 or to strive to increase production by 4% to 5%, depending on the severity of the disaster. In order to promote the rapid and healthy development of this campaign, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government transferred more than 200 cadres from provincial-level agencies to form three work teams, which went to the disaster-stricken Jiujiang, Nanchang, Shangrao and other regions to assist in the work. Leading organs at all levels below the provincial level have also transferred a large number of cadres to form work groups to go to the countryside.

Now, throughout Jiangxi Province, from the mountainous areas of southwestern Jiangxi to the plains along the shore of Poyang Lake, the broad masses of peasants have been actively and intensively taking action under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government and with the impetus of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In recent months, there has been less rainfall in the southern Jiangxi region, and some areas have experienced drought. In order to expand the planting area of late rice and complete the production increase plan, farmers have launched an intense struggle to fight drought and rush planting. In some villages in the eighth and ninth districts of Nankang County, more than 1,740 waterwheels were organized to carry out a blitz of water drawing, rushing to plant more than 12,000 mu of late rice. Farmers in Nankang, Xinfeng, Anyuan, Shicheng and other counties have also repaired many small-scale water conservancy projects to store water and prevent drought. After propaganda and education, the farmers in the seventh district of Nanchang County changed their thinking of "early rice is a treasure, late rice is grass" and actively expanded the planting area of late rice. The entire district plans to plant 6,000 mu of late rice, and 4,000 mu have already been planted. Some farmers have planted late rice on fields that have not been planted with late rice for sixty years.

In order to help the disaster-stricken farmers in some areas along the river and around the lake to overcome the difficulties of rushing to plant and replant, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government has specially raised millions of catties of "Red Grain Seed" from many places in the province. This kind of rice seed can be sown late and directly, matures quickly, is not afraid of water, requires less fertilizer, and yields well. At present, 400,000 catties of this rice seed have been transferred to Nanchang County, and other parts are being transferred to various places in an intensive manner. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau and the Pumping Station also allocated nine diesel-powered water pumps and transferred eleven technicians to help farmers in Yongxin, Suichuan, Jishui and other counties.

### 江西开展大规模增产节约生产救灾运动

    江西开展大规模增产节约生产救灾运动
    据新华社南昌七日电：一个大规模的增产节约生产救灾运动，正在江西省广大农村展开。这个运动的目标是要在部分沿江、滨湖地区遭受水灾的情况下，力争完成原订的全省全年农业增产计划。
    从七月下旬中共江西省委员会发出指示后近十天来，全省各县大多迅速召开中共县委员会紧急会议，集中或分片召开区委书记、区长联席会议，作出了增产节约生产救灾的具体部署，并进行了动员。在广大的非灾区，这种紧急会议除提出保证完成原订全年增产计划任务外，还从分析本地具体情况入手，提出了追加的增产计划。中共吉安地方委员会决定把全专区原订全年增产百分之七的计划提高为增产百分之十。在这个新的增产计划中，仅推广中稻的再生稻一项，就可以多增产稻谷一亿二千万斤。在沿江、滨湖部分遭受水灾的县份，也分别灾害轻重情况，提出力争保持一九五三年的实际产量或争取增产百分之四到百分之五的计划。为了推动这个运动迅速、健康地开展，中共江西省委员会和江西省人民政府从省级机关中抽调的两百多个干部组成三个工作团，分赴受灾的九江、南昌、上饶等专区协助工作。省以下各级领导机关也多抽调大批干部组成工作组下乡。
    现在江西全省从赣西南山地到鄱阳湖滨平原，广大农民群众已经在共产党和人民政府的领导和互助合作组织的带动下，积极、紧张地行动起来。近月来赣南地区雨水较少，部分地方发生旱象，农民为了扩大晚稻栽种面积，完成增产计划，展开了紧张的抗旱抢种斗争。南康县第八、第九两区部分乡村农民组织了一千七百四十多辆水车突击车水，抢种下晚稻一万二千多亩。南康、信丰、安远、石城等县农民还修补了许多小型水利工程，蓄水防旱。南昌县第七区农民经过宣传教育，改变了“早稻是宝，晚稻是草”的思想，积极扩大晚稻种植面积。全区计划种植晚稻六千亩，已种上四千亩。有的农民把六十年来没有种过晚稻的田，也种上了晚稻。
    江西省人民政府农林厅为了帮助沿江、滨湖部分地区受灾农民克服抢种补种的困难，特地从省内许多地方筹集了几百万斤“红谷种”。这种稻种可以晚播和直播，成熟快，不怕水，需肥少，收成好。目前这种稻种已有四十万斤调运到南昌县，其他部分正在紧张调运各地。江西省人民政府水利局和抽水机总站也拨出九台柴油动力抽水机和抽调十一名技术工人，帮助永新、遂川、吉水等县的农民。
