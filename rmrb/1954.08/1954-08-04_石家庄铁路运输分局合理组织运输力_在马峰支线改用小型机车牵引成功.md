Shijiazhuang Railway Transportation Bureau Rationally Organizes Transportation Capacity
Successfully Converts to Small Locomotive Traction on the Mafeng Branch Line

The Shijiazhuang Transportation Bureau of the Tianjin Railway Administration recently converted to using SL5 small locomotives to haul freight trains on the Mafeng branch line of the Jinghan Line, replacing MK6 large locomotives for use on the main line, thus maximizing the effectiveness of locomotive transportation.

The Mafeng branch line is a railway approximately 23 kilometers long, running from Mafeng Station to the Fengfeng Coal Mine. The Fengfeng Coal Mine is rich in coal resources, relying on railway support for industrial production throughout the country. Previously, this section used MK6 large locomotives for traction. Due to the limitations of the downhill gradient, it was stipulated that it could only haul a maximum of 600 tons downhill. However, in reality, due to the low loading capacity of the coal mine and the inability of the Jinghan main line to deliver empty cars in complete batches, each trip averaged only 400 to 450 tons. MK6 large locomotives can haul 1,800 tons on the Jinghan main line, resulting in a significant waste of locomotive traction power.

In March of this year, the Shijiazhuang Bureau called on its employees to maximize the potential of existing transportation equipment and held a forum for technical personnel. Engineer Zhang Mei of the Locomotive Department proposed using SL5 small locomotives for traction on the Mafeng branch line and replacing them with MK6 large locomotives on the main line. This would increase the number of operational locomotives on the main line and maximize the potential of the locomotives. This suggestion received strong support from the Bureau's Party Committee and, with the help of the Tianjin Railway Administration working group, a method of adding water tank cars to the small locomotives was developed to solve the problems of the small water tank capacity of the SL5 small locomotives and the lack of water supply equipment at Fengfeng Station. Tests have proven that SL5 small locomotives can fully meet the transportation needs of the Mafeng branch line.

Currently, the two MK6 large locomotives on the Mafeng branch line have been replaced and transferred to the Shi (Shijiazhuang) Tai (Taiyuan) line for use. According to calculations, MK6 large locomotives can complete 7.56 million ton-kilometers per month on the Shi-Tai line, while they can only complete 4.468 million ton-kilometers on the Mafeng branch line. The coal consumption per 10,000 ton-kilometers for MK6 large locomotives on the Mafeng branch line is 322 kilograms. After switching to SL5 small locomotives, the coal consumption per 10,000 ton-kilometers is only 260.3 kilograms, saving more than 27 tons of coal per locomotive per month.

    石家庄铁路运输分局合理组织运输力
    在马峰支线改用小型机车牵引成功
    天津铁路管理局石家庄运输分局最近在京汉线马峰支线改用ㄙ?5小型机车牵引货物列车，把冖ㄎ6大型机车换下在正线使用，发挥了机车运输效能。
    马峰支线是由马峰车站通向峰峰煤矿的一条长约二十三公里的铁路，峰峰煤矿盛产煤炭，依靠铁路支援各地工业生产。很早以前，这个区间就使用着冖ㄎ6大型机车牵引。因为受着下行上坡道的限制，规定它下行最多只能牵引六百吨，但实际上由于煤矿装车能力低，加上京汉正线不能给整批送空车，每趟平均只能牵引四百吨到四百五十吨。而冖ㄎ6大型机车在京汉正线即可牵引一千八百吨，因此机车牵引力有很大的浪费。
    今年三月份，石家庄分局号召职工，发挥现有运输设备潜力，并召开了一次技术人员座谈会。机务科张美工程师在会上提出马峰支线改用ㄙ?5小型机车牵引，把冖ㄎ6大型机车换到正线上使用，这样既增加了正线上的运用机车，又发挥了机车的潜力。这个建议得到分局党委大力支持，又在天津铁路管理局工作组的帮助下，研究出小型机车加挂水槽车的办法，解决了ㄙ?5小型机车水箱小和峰峰车站没有给水设备的困难。试验结果证明ㄙ?5小型机车完全可以满足马峰支线的运输需要。
    现在，马峰支线上的两台冖ㄎ6大型机车已经替换下来了，调到石（石家庄）太（太原）线上使用。根据计算，冖ㄎ6大型机车在石太线上每月可完成七百五十六万吨公里，在马峰支线上只能完成四百四十六点八万吨公里；在马峰支线用冖ㄎ6大型机车每万吨公里用煤量是三百二十二公斤，换上ㄙ?5小型机车后，每万吨公里只用煤二百六十点三公斤，每月每台机车省煤二十七吨多。
