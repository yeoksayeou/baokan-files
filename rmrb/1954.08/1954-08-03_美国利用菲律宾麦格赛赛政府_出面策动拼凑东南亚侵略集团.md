Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: The United States is stepping up its efforts to use the Philippine Magsaysay government to actively promote its plan to concoct a Southeast Asian aggression bloc, in order to prevent the international tension from easing due to the ceasefire in Indochina.

A spokesman for the Magsaysay government announced on July 30th that the Magsaysay government has decided to participate in the meeting convened by the United States to discuss the establishment of a Southeast Asian aggression bloc. The Magsaysay government also "suggested" to the United States that this meeting be held in Baguio, Philippines, and this "suggestion" has been accepted by the United States. After the failure of the Baguio Conference in 1950, where the United States concocted the Pacific Aggression Bloc, the fact that the United States is once again using the Philippine puppet government to come forward and concoct a Southeast Asian aggression bloc shows the inferior tactics that the United States is forced to repeatedly adopt in the face of the rising anti-colonial movement in the East. A recent issue of the American "Newsweek" magazine published Magsaysay's remarks to the magazine's reporter, saying that he believes his government can play an "explanatory role" between Western countries and Far Eastern countries, that is, to make Far Eastern countries "agree" with the view that "the United States is no longer a colonizer here."

The United States' vicious intention to use the Southeast Asian aggression bloc to undermine the Indochina armistice agreement has become increasingly exposed. Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Garcia said that the Philippines, along with the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, etc., are regarded as possible "founding countries" of the Southeast Asian aggression bloc planned by the United States; while Japan, Bao Dai Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gang, and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang are regarded as "future member states." During the Geneva Conference, the United States repeatedly tried to drag Indochina into the Southeast Asian aggression bloc to prevent the conference from reaching an agreement. Garcia's remarks, just after returning from Washington, confirm that although the Indochina armistice agreement clearly stipulates that the three Indochinese countries shall not participate in any military alliances, the United States has not abandoned its conspiracy to undermine the restoration of peace in Indochina. This cannot but arouse greater vigilance among all those who hope for the easing of international tensions, and strengthen opposition to the United States' conspiracy to concoct a Southeast Asian aggression bloc, in order to ensure the implementation of the Indochina armistice agreement.

    美国利用菲律宾麦格赛赛政府
    出面策动拼凑东南亚侵略集团
      【新华社三十一日讯】美国正加紧利用菲律宾麦格赛赛政府为它的拼凑东南亚侵略集团计划出面进行积极的活动，以阻挠国际紧张局势由于印度支那停火而趋向缓和。
    麦格赛赛政府的发言人七月三十日宣布，麦格赛赛政府已决定参加美国召集的讨论成立东南亚侵略集团的会议。麦格赛赛政府并向美国“建议”在菲律宾的碧瑶举行这个会议，而这个“建议”也已为美国所接受。美国在一九五○年拼凑太平洋侵略集团的碧瑶会议失败之后，再度利用菲律宾傀儡政府出面为它拼凑东南亚侵略集团，说明了美国在高涨的东方反殖民主义运动面前所不得不重复采用的下策。最近一期的美国“新闻周刊”登载麦格赛赛对这个刊物的记者的谈话说，他相信他的政府能够在西方国家和远东国家之间起“解释作用”，就是使远东国家“赞成”这样的看法：“美国在这里已不再是一个殖民者”。
    美国蓄谋利用东南亚侵略集团来破坏印度支那停战协定的恶毒用意，已经愈来愈暴露。菲律宾副总统兼外交部部长加西亚说，菲律宾已和美国、英国、澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国等一起被视为美国策划中的东南亚侵略集团的可能的“创始国”；而日本、保大越南、柬埔寨、老挝、台湾国民党匪帮和李承晚匪帮都被视为“将来的成员国”。美国在日内瓦会议进行期间，就曾一再要把印度支那拖入东南亚侵略集团，以阻挠会议达成协议。刚从华盛顿回国的加西亚的这些话证实，尽管印度支那停战协定已经明确规定印度支那三国不得参加任何军事同盟，美国并没有放弃它的破坏印度支那恢复和平的阴谋。这就不能不引起所有希望国际紧张局势缓和的人士更加提高警惕，加强反对美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团的阴谋，以保证印度支那停战协定的实现。
