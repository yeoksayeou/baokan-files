    Building a Beautiful and Happy New Socialist Countryside
    ——Excerpts from the Speech of Han En, Deputy to the Jilin Provincial People's Congress
    The publication of the draft Constitution is a joyous event for the people of the whole country, and everyone has unspeakable joy and excitement. Every article of the draft Constitution embodies the common interests of the people of the whole country and reflects the common aspirations of the people of the whole country to build socialism. I wholeheartedly support it.
    As everyone knows, our Bao'an Village in Jiaohe County (formerly a well-known "poverty-stricken village"). However, since the land reform, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we have taken the socialist road of organizing ourselves for common prosperity, and production has been greatly developed. Everyone says, "We are changing every year," which is indeed true. We have developed from a mutual aid team of eighteen households to today's agricultural production cooperative of one hundred and eight households. The road of cooperation has gradually enriched everyone. After the autumn harvest distribution this year, all the farmers in our cooperative can reach the living standards of middle peasants, and most of the old cooperative members have exceeded the living standards of middle peasants. Now, the draft Constitution has written down our farmers' desire to take the socialist road. Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the draft Constitution stipulates: "The state protects the property of cooperatives, encourages, guides, and helps the development of the cooperative economy, and takes the development of production cooperatives as the main path for transforming individual agriculture and individual handicrafts." How can we not be moved and excited to see this solemn and clear provision?
    After studying the General Line, the political consciousness of all members of our cooperative has been greatly improved. After studying and discussing the draft Constitution, everyone's confidence in taking the road of cooperation has become even firmer. All members of the cooperative not only actively strive to create conditions to transition to a fully socialist agricultural production cooperative after the autumn harvest this year, but also gradually absorb the surrounding farmers to expand our cooperative and lead the surrounding farmers to jointly take the road of cooperation. This year, the crops in our cooperative are growing well. In addition to our own consumption, we can also overfulfill the plan to sell 700,000 jin of grain to the state. Now we are repairing fish ponds (raising 20,000 fish fry), selecting seed fields, building residential houses for cooperative members, and accumulating manure to lay the foundation for expanding production next year. We are also preparing to install electrical equipment after the autumn harvest. In addition to the electricity for electric lights in the cooperative members' residences, we are also preparing to use electricity to power threshing machines, grinding stones, and mills. Currently, there is a shortage of vegetables in Xinzhan Street, and the price of imported vegetables plus transportation costs is very high, and the workers cannot even eat fresh vegetables. In order to enable the working class brothers to eat cheap and fresh vegetables, we plan to add a glass cellar ten zhang long and two zhang five chi wide this autumn, and plant five qing of vegetables next year to ensure the supply to the city. In order to better support the country's socialist industrialization, our cooperative plans to expand to 250 households next year, with 300 qing of land, and sell 1.5 million jin of grain to the state in the autumn. In addition, we will also mobilize each cooperative member to raise four pigs, and the cooperative will develop animal husbandry to ensure an annual supply of 100,000 jin of pork, 90,000 jin of beef, and 80,000 eggs to the city, so that the working class brothers can eat better and our country can be built faster. Our preliminary plan is that with the continuous development and expansion of the cooperative and the improvement of production, by 1957, the public property of the entire cooperative will reach more than 2 billion yuan. We will also build two more fish ponds, plant a ten-li-long shelterbelt, and build bathhouses, nurseries, and hospitals. There will be three trucks to replace the current flower-wheeled carts and rubber-tired carts to transport the things produced by the cooperative. We will turn Bo Mountain into an orchard and turn the meadow into a large pasture. This is our three-year struggle goal. Under the leadership of the Party, all our members have the confidence to overcome various difficulties to complete this plan, so as to build our motherland better and stronger as soon as possible.

    建设美丽幸福的新农村
    ——吉林省人民代表大会代表韩恩的发言摘要
    宪法草案的公布，是全国人民的大喜事，每个人都有说不出的喜悦和兴奋。宪法草案的每一条都体现了全国人民的共同利益，反映了全国人民建设社会主义的共同愿望，我是衷心拥护的。
    大家知道，我们蛟河县保安屯（过去是有名的穷棒子屯。可是，从土地改革以后，我们在中国共产党的领导下，走组织起来大家富裕的社会主义道路，生产得到了大发展，大家都说：“我们是一年一变样”，这确实不假。我们由十八户的互助组发展到今天一百零八户的生产合作社。合作化的道路，使大家逐步富裕起来，今年秋收分红后，我们全社的农民可全部达到中农的生活水平，一些老社员，大部分都超过中农的生活水平了。现在宪法草案写下了我们农民走社会主义道路的愿望，宪法草案第七条第二款规定：“国家保护合作社的财产，鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展，并且以发展生产合作社为改造个体农业和个体手工业的主要道路。”看到这庄严明确的规定，怎能不感动和兴奋啊。
    我们社的全体社员经过学习总路线，政治觉悟有了很大的提高，又经过学习和讨论宪法草案，大家走合作化道路的信心更加坚定了。全体社员不但积极努力创造条件，争取今年秋后过渡到完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，而且还要逐步吸收周围农民扩大我们的合作社，带动周围农民共同走合作化的道路。今年我们社的庄稼长得好，除了自己吃，还可以超额完成卖给国家七十万斤粮食的计划。现在我们正在修养鱼池（养两万鱼苗），选留种田，盖社员住宅，积攒粪肥，为明年扩大生产打基础；还准备在秋后安装电力设备，除了社员住宅的电灯用电外，还准备用电来牵引打稻机、碾和磨。现在新站街的菜不足，外来的菜加上运费，价格很高，工人同志们还吃不着新鲜菜。我们为了使工人老大哥吃到廉价的新鲜菜，我们计划今年秋天增设一座十丈长两丈五尺宽的玻璃窖，明年种五垧蔬菜，来保证供应城市的需要。为了更好地支援国家的社会主义工业化，我们社明年计划扩大到二百五十户，土地达到三百垧，到秋天要卖给国家一百五十万斤粮食。另外我们还要发动每户社员养四口猪，社里要发展牧畜业，保证一年供应城市十万斤猪肉、九万斤牛肉和八万个鸡蛋，让工人老大哥吃得更好一些，使我们的国家建设得更快一些。我们初步计划，随着合作社的不断发展壮大和生产的提高，到一九五七年，全社的公共财产，要达到二十几亿，并要再修建两个养鱼池，栽十里地长的防护林带，还要修建起澡塘、托儿所和医院。要有三辆载重汽车，用来代替现在的花轮车和胶皮轮车载运合作社所生产的东西。要把薄山变成果树园，把草甸子变成大牧场。这就是我们今后三年的奋斗目标，我们全体社员，在党的领导下，有信心克服各种困难完成这个计划，以便早日把我们的祖国建设得更美好更富强。
