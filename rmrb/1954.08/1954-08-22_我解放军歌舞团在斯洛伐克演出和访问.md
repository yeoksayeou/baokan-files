Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 21st: The Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe continues to perform and visit various locations in Slovakia.

The scene before and after the troupe's performance in Prešov on the 18th was unforgettable. Long before the troupe arrived, people from all corners of the city, from factories, and from nearby towns and villages, gathered on the streets the troupe was to pass through. When the Chinese military artists arrived, waves of enthusiastic applause erupted from the crowd. Unfortunately, it rained that day, and people were worried that the Chinese friends, whose performance schedule was already set, would not be able to perform in the open-air theater. Many eagerly inquired about it. However, the loudspeakers on the street then broadcast the news that the troupe had decided to perform in the open-air theater in the evening, and the people's emotions surged. In the evening, more than 10,000 enthusiastic spectators gathered at the open-air theater to watch the troupe's wonderful performance. Waves of applause and cheers expressed their love for the troupe and their appreciation for their art. To express their love and gratitude to the Chinese friends, the local people also sent representatives to give many gifts to the troupe after the performance.

Prior to this, the troupe performed for 15,000 spectators in Banská Bystrica on the 15th and visited local places of interest. On the 17th, they performed in Košice and visited the local machine manufacturing factory, and also had cordial conversations with the workers who were manufacturing orders for China.

    我解放军歌舞团在斯洛伐克演出和访问
    【新华社布格拉二十一日电】中国人民解放军歌舞团继续在斯洛伐克各地演出和访问。
    歌舞团十八日到普累索夫市表演前后的情景是令人难忘的。在歌舞团到达之前很久，人们便从城市的各个角落、从工厂、从附近的城镇乡村，赶到歌舞团要经过的大街上。当中国部队文艺工作者到来时，人群中顿时响起了一阵又一阵的热烈鼓掌声。不巧那天下雨，人们担心着演出日程排定了的中国友人会无法在露天剧场演出。许多人急切地相互询问。但是大街上的扩音器随后向人们播送了歌舞团决定晚间在露天剧场演出的消息，人们的情绪顿时高涨起来。晚间，一万多热情的观众聚集到露天剧场观看了歌舞团演出的精采节目。一阵阵掌声和欢呼声表达了他们对歌舞团的热爱和对他们艺术的赞赏。为了表示对中国友人的热爱和感谢，当地人民在表演结束后还派代表把许多礼物赠给歌舞团。
    在此以前，歌舞团曾于十五日在班斯卡—佩斯蒂利扎为一万五千观众演出并参观了当地的名胜。于十七日在科息斯演出并参观了当地的机器制造厂，还和为中国制造订货的工人们进行了亲切的谈话。
