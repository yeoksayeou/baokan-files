Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 19th: The members of both sides of the Third Joint Observer Team met near Guque Cave at about 3:00 PM on the 18th to conduct a joint investigation. Witness testimonies and material evidence prove that three U.S. military personnel crossed the Military Demarcation Line on the morning of the 17th and launched an armed attack on the civil police of the Korean-Chinese side.

The members of both sides first inspected the scene of the incident, and then questioned the witnesses, Korean-Chinese civil police Li Zhenshan, Zhu Xuekun, and Mi Baoliang. The witnesses testified that at around 3:30 AM on the 17th, while they were patrolling near Guque Cave, they discovered three people moving from south to north. After they made inquiries, the two people at the back opened fire. The witnesses returned fire, killing the person in the lead, and the other two fled south across the Military Demarcation Line to the U.S.-controlled area.

The members of both sides also viewed the evidence left behind by the deceased. The deceased was wearing a South Korean Rhee Syngman puppet army uniform. U.S.-made rations wrapped in transparent paper, as well as a small notebook with a photo of the deceased, were found on his person. On the back of the photo was written "Seoul Yongdu-dong, Bin Yuan Shu, May 14th." The Korean-Chinese side members pointed out that the witness testimonies and material evidence completely prove that U.S. military personnel crossed the Military Demarcation Line and launched an armed attack on the civil police of the Korean-Chinese side.

The U.S. side members initially claimed that he had no further questions and suggested ending the joint investigation. However, when the Korean-Chinese side members repeatedly demanded that both sides clarify the differences of opinion on the spot, he disregarded the witness testimonies, the material evidence, and the body of the attacker left at the scene, and insisted that the evidence proving the incident was unfounded.

The Korean-Chinese side members refuted the U.S. side member's evasion of the facts. The members of both sides are scheduled to meet again on the afternoon of the 20th to discuss submitting a report to the Military Armistice Commission.

    第三联合观察小组双方组员进行共同调查
    证实美方军事人员袭击我方民政警察
    【新华社开城十九日电】第三联合观察小组双方组员十八日下午三时许在古阙洞附近会晤，进行共同调查。证人证词和证物证明，有三名美方军事人员在十七日晨越过军事分界线武装袭击朝中方面的民政警察。
    双方组员首先视察了发生事件的现场，接着询问了证人朝中方面民政警察李振山、朱学坤、米宝亮。证人的证词说：十七日清晨三时三十分左右，当他们在古阙洞附近巡逻的时候，发现有三个人从南向北移动。当他们发出询问后，走在后面的两个人就开枪射击。证人等开枪还击，打死走在前面的一个人，另外两个人向军事分界线以南美方地区逃去。
    双方组员还观看了死者遗留下的证物。死者身着南朝鲜李承晚伪军军服，在身上搜出用透明纸包的美国制干粮，以及夹有死者本人照片的小笔记本。照片背面写有“汉城龙头洞·宾原述五月十四日”的字样。朝中方面组员指出：证人证词和证物完全证明美方军事人员越过军事分界线武装袭击朝中方面民政警察。
    美方组员起初声称，他没有其他问题，建议结束共同调查。但是当朝中方面组员接连地要求双方在现场澄清分歧意见时，他又不顾证人证词、证物和在现场停置的袭击者的尸体，硬说证明发生这一事件的证据是没有根据的。
    朝中方面组员驳斥了美方组员的逃避事实。双方组员定于二十日下午再度会晤，讨论向军事停战委员会提出报告。
