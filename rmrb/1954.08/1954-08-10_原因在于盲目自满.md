The reason lies in blind complacency
Zhang Wanliang

This spring, Anci County, Hebei Province, had a total of one hundred and thirty-four agricultural production cooperatives. A round of rectification was carried out before the spring planting. At that time, according to the county party committee's analysis, the problem cooperatives accounted for about 10% of the total number of cooperatives in the county. However, after the rectification, as they entered the intense production stage, the number of wavering and disunited cooperatives gradually increased instead.

After some rectification, more than 90% of the cooperatives in the county formulated production plans; more than half of the cooperatives implemented small-scale contracting; nine cooperatives purged landlords and rich peasants; and each cooperative had an average of five core members. Seeing these numerical achievements, the county party committee leaders were satisfied, believing that the vast majority of cooperatives in the county "had no major problems."

In fact, this rectification did not solve many problems. Some cooperatives originally had a poor foundation for their establishment, and the members joined with a "let's give it a try" attitude, keeping a lot of private plots (generally 20%, some even 30% to 40%), and keeping good land. Some cooperative cadres were selfish, raising the price of their means of production when they joined the cooperative, causing dissatisfaction among the members. There were also individual cooperatives with impure leadership components. These problems were not properly addressed and resolved during the rectification. Therefore, as soon as production started, many problems were exposed. For example, the Zhang Rang Cooperative and Lang Fengyuan Cooperative in Gu County Village, and the Yang Yuquan Cooperative in Dongyang Village, were all considered by the county to be cooperatives that were "producing well and had no problems after the rectification," but when the busy farming season came, the members only cared about cultivating their private plots and did not care about the cooperative's production. Some cooperative land was already lying fallow, and the members were ideologically wavering, clamoring to break up. In addition, cooperative cadres avoiding heavy work and choosing easy tasks when assigning work, and recording half labor as full labor when recording work points, always trying to take advantage of the members, also became a relatively common phenomenon.

County and district cadres believed that there were "no problems" in the cooperatives, and the cooperative cadres only wanted to say good things and were unwilling to say bad things, so it was difficult to discover problems in time when they really arose. For example, the Fuchunshan Cooperative in Langfang Town, died two animals not long after its establishment this year, but when the cooperative cadres reported on the cooperative's management and operation, they spoke very well, not mentioning the death of the animals at all. Gu County Village is a key village, and a full-time cadre sent by the county party committee to engage in mutual aid and cooperation, as well as a working group from the district party committee, are often stationed there. However, two cooperatives in the village had problems because of the unified allocation of labor, and the members wanted to break up, causing a disturbance for more than ten days, but the working group did not know about it. District One is a district with relatively good cooperative management in the county. By June of this year, in four townships and twenty-one cooperatives, six cooperatives were producing worse than mutual aid teams, and the members were emotionally wavering, with many problems, accounting for 28.5%. However, according to the "situation" grasped by the county party committee, the cooperatives with problems were still "no more than 10%."

The county party committee's work is superficial and careless, yet blindly complacent; the reason why the number of agricultural production cooperatives with problems in Anci County increased after rectification lies here.

    原因在于盲目自满
    张万良
    河北省安次县今年春季共有一百三十四个农业生产合作社。在春播前，曾进行过一番整顿。当时，据县委分析，全县有问题的社约占全县总社数的百分之十。但是整顿以后，进入紧张的生产阶段时，动摇涣散的社反而逐渐增多了。
    经过一番整顿，全县有百分之九十以上的社订了生产计划；有一半以上的社实行了小包工；有九个社内清洗了地主富农；每社平均有五个骨干。看到这些数字上的成绩，县委领导满足了，认为全县绝大多数社“没大问题”了。
    实际上这次整顿并没有解决多少问题。有一部分社原来建社基础不大好，社员入社是抱着
  “试试看”的态度，自留地多（一般留百分之二十，有的留百分之三十至四十），而且是留好地。有的社干部自私，入社时抬高自己生产资料的入股价格，引起社员不满。还有个别社领导成分不纯。这些问题在整顿时都没有适当处理解决。因此，一开始生产，许多问题就暴露出来了。像古县村的张让社、郎凤元社、东杨庄的杨玉全社等都是县里认为“整顿以后生产很好，没有问题”的社，可是一到农忙时，社员就只顾耕种自留地，不关心社里生产。有的社土地已经撩荒了，社员思想动摇，吵嚷着散伙。另外，社干部在派工中避重就轻、记工时以半劳力记整工，处处想占社员便宜，也成了比较普遍的现象。
    县区干部认为社里“没问题”，社干部又只愿说好不愿说坏，因此，真有了问题也很难及时发现。如廊坊镇富春山社，今年建社不久就死了两头牲口，但社干部汇报社内经营管理情况时，却说得很好，对死牲口的事一字也不提。古县村是重点村，经常住着一个县委派去搞互助合作的专职干部，还有区委的工作组。可是，村里有两个社因为统一支配劳力有问题，社员要散伙，闹了十多天，工作组都不知道。一区是全县办社比较好的一个区，到今年六月间，在四个乡二十一个社中，有六个社生产不如互助组，社员情绪动摇，问题较多，占了百分之二十八点五。可是根据县委掌握的“情况”，有问题的社仍是“不超过百分之十”。
    县委工作肤皮潦草，却又盲目自满；安次县整顿农业生产合作社以后有问题的社反而增多了起来，原因就在这里。
