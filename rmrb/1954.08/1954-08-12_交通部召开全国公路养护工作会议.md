The Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government convened a National Highway Maintenance Work Conference in Beijing from July 22nd to August 2nd.

Over the past few years, our country's highway maintenance work has achieved results. According to statistics, maintenance is now being carried out on 80 percent of the mileage open to traffic, an increase of 47 percent compared to 1950; as a result, the general driving speed has increased by 30 to 40 percent compared to 1950.

In order to further improve highway maintenance work, the conference determined that existing highways must be kept open to traffic smoothly, and on the basis of strengthening repairs to ensure traffic, the quality of use should be gradually improved, so as to enhance the passing capacity and driving safety, and promote the road maintenance policy of reducing transportation costs. According to this work policy, the conference determined specific measures such as strengthening planned management, technical management, establishing a responsibility system, and rectifying labor discipline. According to the heavy rains and floods in various places this year, the conference determined that provinces with severe highway water damage should focus on rescuing flood damage and restoring traffic; areas where the rainy season has not yet passed should strengthen prevention work.

    交通部召开全国公路养护工作会议
    中央人民政府交通部于七月二十二日至八月二日，在北京召开了全国公路养护工作会议。
    几年来我国公路的养护工作已取得成绩。据统计，现在用各种方式进行养护的已占通车里程百分之八十，比一九五○年增加百分之四十七；因而使一般行车速率比一九五○年提高百分之三十至四十。
    为进一步做好公路养护工作，会议确定现有公路必须保持顺利通车，并在加强修理保证通车的基础上，逐步提高使用质量，以增强通过能力和行车安全，促进运输成本降低的养路工作方针。根据这一工作方针，会议确定了加强计划管理、技术管理、建立责任制、整顿劳动纪律等具体措施。会议根据今年各地雨多水大的情况，确定凡公路遭受水患严重的省份，目前应以抢救水毁、恢复交通为中心工作；雨季未过的地区应加强预防工作。
