    Hubei Province's State-Run Wusan Farm Strives to Cultivate Ratoon Rice and Rush to Plant Late Autumn Crops
    Aiming to Increase Grain Production by More Than Three Million Jin to Support Disaster Areas
    The 8,800 mu of early rice at the State-Run Wusan Mechanical Farm in Hubei Province has achieved a bumper harvest. Although this year's rice crop suffered from natural disasters such as wind, hail, and floods, the average yield was still more than 700 jin per mu, and a number of "thousand-jin mu" high-yield fields emerged. In order to increase grain production by more than 3 million jin to support disaster areas and national construction, the farm has decided to cultivate ratoon rice in more than 70% of the paddy fields and reclaim wasteland to rush plant more than 14,000 mu of buckwheat, millet, late rice, and other late autumn crops. In order to complete the task of increasing production again, since August 1, young tractor drivers have been driving tractors, pulling huge five-bottom plows, disc harrows, and other equipment, day and night, to reclaim wasteland and prepare land in the fields.
    The Wusan Farm was established on a piece of wasteland bordering the four counties of Jingshan, Qianjiang, Tianmen, and Zhongxiang. More than a year ago, this was still a wild land overgrown with reeds. After more than a year of hard work by more than 1,000 employees of the farm, this piece of land has been transformed into fertile fields, becoming the "granary" of the motherland. (Mo Huaqing)

    湖北省国营五三农场努力培育再生稻并抢种晚秋作物
    争取再增产三百多万斤粮食支援灾区
    湖北省国营五三机械农场八千八百亩早稻获得丰收。农场今年的水稻，虽然遭受到风、雹、水灾等自然灾害的袭击，平均每亩仍产七百多斤，并出现了一批“千斤亩”的高额产量田。为了再增产三百余万斤粮食，支援灾区和国家建设，农场决定在百分之七十以上的稻田里培育再生稻，并开荒抢播一万四千多亩的荞麦、粟谷、晚稻等晚秋作物。为了完成再增产的任务，从八月一日起，青年的拖拉机手们，驾驶着拖拉机牵引着巨大的五铧犁、圆盘耙等，夜以继日地在田里开荒、整地。
    五三农场是在京山、潜江、天门、钟祥四县毗连的一片荒地上建立起来的，一年多以前，这里还是一片芦苇丛生的荒野，经过农场一千多职工一年多的辛勤的劳动，把这块地变成良田，成了祖国的“粮仓”。（莫华清）
