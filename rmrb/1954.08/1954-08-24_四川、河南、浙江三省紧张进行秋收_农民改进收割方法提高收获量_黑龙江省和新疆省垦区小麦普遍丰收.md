    Sichuan, Henan, and Zhejiang Provinces Intensively Carry Out Autumn Harvest
    Farmers Improve Harvesting Methods to Increase Yield
    Heilongjiang Province and Xinjiang Reclamation Area Achieve Universal Wheat Harvest
    Sichuan, Henan, and Zhejiang provinces are carrying out the autumn harvest intensively. The broad masses of farmers are improving harvesting methods, striving to increase field yields, and aiming to overfulfill the production increase plans.
    The autumn harvest has begun in most areas of Sichuan Province. Except for the West Sichuan Plain and high-altitude cold mountain areas, the Wanxian, Fuling, Jiangjin, Neijiang and other special districts are intensively harvesting rice. News of bumper harvests is constantly spreading from the joyous fields. Members of the Luzhou Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative, holding ears of grain with three to four hundred kernels, are reporting good news to the cadres, saying that the entire cooperative has increased production by more than 15% compared to last year. The Jiang Shuyun Mutual Aid Team in Fushun County harvested 76 piculs of grain from 65 piculs of field, an increase of 13%. Weiyuan County's more than 200,000 mu of rice yielded an average of 528 jin of grain per mu, with the county increasing production by 14 million jin of rice compared to last year. In order to increase field yields, farmers in various counties of the Luzhou Special District are striving to improve harvesting methods and are universally promoting advanced threshing methods. Longchang County alone can harvest more than 9.7 million jin of grain this year simply by reducing spillage. The Nanchong Special District has promoted 2,700 threshing machines, coupled with improved original mixing barrel baffles, which can reduce spillage by 35 million jin in the district's 5 million mu of rice. In order to overcome autumn rains and prevent grain from rotting, many places have also prepared kang stoves, roasting pots, and windmills for timely threshing and drying. Patches of drying grounds are covered with golden grain.
    Early autumn crops in Henan Province have already begun to be harvested, and sorghum and early millet in most areas can increase production. Spring millet in the Shangqiu Special District is estimated to yield 240 jin per mu, an increase of about 20%. The Gaozhuang First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Puyang Third District harvested 300 jin of millet per mu from medium-yielding land, 50 jin more than last year. Cotton in cotton-producing areas has generally grown to two chi (about 2/3 of a meter) high, and cotton farmers are confident of overfulfilling the production increase plan. Cotton fields in the Xinxiang Special District have generally been hoed four to six times, with pruning done two to three times. There are fewer empty branches and more cotton bolls than in previous years. It is estimated that each mu can yield 100 to 200 jin. Wheat stubble cotton in Luoyang, Puyang, Nanyang and other special districts is also growing well. Other late autumn crops, such as corn, are tasseling, and soybeans have begun to blossom and set pods. All localities are strengthening the late-stage management of autumn fields, improving harvesting methods, and carrying out flood prevention work to ensure a bumper autumn harvest.
    At present, most areas of Zhejiang Province are in the midst of the busy autumn harvest and autumn planting season. This year, the province's early rice and early mid-season rice totaled more than 13 million mu, most of which has been harvested, and the total output can exceed last year. Many counties have increased production by an average of 10% to 20% compared to last year. The province's more than 4 million mu of mid-season indica rice has entered the grouting and yellow ripening stage and can be harvested in about half a month. A good harvest is generally expected. Tens of thousands of mu of mid-season indica rice in Xiaoshan County is estimated to increase production by about 10%. The province's more than 13 million mu of late rice has mostly reached the round stalk and jointing stage, and some has begun to conceive ears. The more than 5 million mu of dryland miscellaneous grain crops such as corn, soybeans, and sweet potatoes have mostly matured and are gradually beginning to be harvested. More than 160,000 mu of miscellaneous grain crops in Linhai County can increase production compared to last year. Tens of thousands of mu of sweet potatoes in Yongjia County can increase production by 20% compared to last year, yielding more than 8 million jin. The province's 1.17 million mu of cotton is blooming and setting bolls, and efforts can be made to complete the production increase plan. The 470,000 mu of jute is also growing vigorously and can overfulfill the production increase plan. In order to increase grain production beyond the plan, farmers in various places, in addition to striving to do a good job in harvesting and strengthening field management of existing crops, are also actively planting another crop in leisure fields under the slogans of "one mu of land equals two mu" and "planting one more mu is one more mu." The area sown with late autumn crops such as corn, soybeans, and buckwheat in the province will be expanded by 4.5 million mu compared to last year. After harvesting more than 1 million mu of early rice and mid-season rice in the Jiaxing Special District and Hang County, farmers will generally cultivate regenerated rice or plant late rice.

    Heilongjiang Province's more than 940,000 hectares of wheat have generally achieved a bumper harvest. According to the actual yield records and general survey estimates of 20 counties in the former Songjiang Province, the average yield per hectare can reach 1,770 jin, an increase of 340 jin compared to the average yield last year. Statistics from seven counties in the former Heilongjiang Province show that the average yield per hectare is 1,836 jin, an increase of 490 jin compared to last year.
    The average yield in the Houyiliba Village in the wheat-producing area of Longjiang County reached about 2,500 jin. This is because the village carried out seed disinfection and used new farm tools for flat sowing and close planting. Secondly, not only was all the wheat land in the village plowed in the autumn, but fertilizer was also applied before plowing.
    The average yield of more than 35,000 hectares of wheat in Ning'an County was 2,000 jin per hectare, mainly because early-maturing wheat varieties were used. The "Nonglin No. 29" wheat variety used in the county shortened the growing period by 10 to 15 days compared to other wheat varieties, thus avoiding the most easily spread diseases.
    In addition to increasing the area sown with new farm tools for flat sowing, most of the wheat sown with old farm tools in Huanan County also adopted a one-third reduction in row spacing or a doubling of the seedling spacing, resulting in an average yield of 2,270 jin.

    The summer harvest work of the agricultural production units of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was basically completed in early August. The entire army's more than 424,900 mu of wheat has generally achieved a bumper harvest, and the yield per unit area has greatly improved compared to last year. The 120,000 mu of winter wheat in the Manas Reclamation Area yielded an average of more than 250 jin per mu, an increase of more than 15% compared to last year. The unit area yield of wheat in the Urumqi Reclamation Area has more than doubled compared to last year. The unit area yield of winter wheat in a certain unit in the Yanqi Reclamation Area reached 400 jin, greatly exceeding the original planned yield.
    This year, the agricultural production units of the Xinjiang Military Region mostly used machines for the summer harvest. Commanders and fighters actively studied and created, improving the efficiency of wheat harvesting. The combined harvester efficiency of a certain unit in the Manas Reclamation Area reached 280 mu per day, exceeding the quota by 62%. Units such as the "August 1st" Farm used tractors to tow three horse-drawn wheat harvesters, which could harvest 300 to 350 mu at most in a day. Due to the full utilization of the efficiency of the machines, the wheat in most units was harvested within ten days.

    四川、河南、浙江三省紧张进行秋收
    农民改进收割方法提高收获量
    黑龙江省和新疆省垦区小麦普遍丰收
    四川、河南、浙江三省紧张进行秋收，广大农民改进收割方法，努力提高田间收获量，争取超额完成增产计划。
    四川省大部地区开始秋收。除川西平原及高寒山区外，万县、涪陵、江津、内江等专区正紧张收割水稻。欢乐的田野里不断传出丰收的喜讯。泸州先锋农业生产合作社的社员们，拿着每吊结了三四百粒谷子的谷穗，纷纷向干部们报喜，全社比去年增产一成半以上。富顺县姜述云互助组收割的六十五挑田，打了七十六挑谷，增产百分之十三，威远县二十多万亩水稻，每亩平均收谷五百二十八斤，全县比去年增产黄谷一千四百万斤。为提高田间收获量，泸州专区各县农民努力改进收割方法，普遍推广先进打谷法。隆昌县仅因减少抛撒，今年就可多收谷子九百七十多万斤。南充专区推广打谷机二千七百部，加上改良原有拌桶挡席，全区五百万亩水稻可减少抛撒三千五百万斤。为战胜秋雨，不让谷子霉烂，许多地方还准备了炕灶、烤锅和风车，及时打晒，一片片的晒坝上，铺满着金黄的谷子。
    河南省早秋作物已经开始收割，大部地区的高粱、早谷子都可增产。商邱专区的春播谷子，估计每亩能收二百四十斤，约增产二成左右。濮阳三区高庄第一农业生产合作社，一亩中等地的谷子收了三百斤，比去年多收五十斤。产棉区的棉花一般都长到二尺高，棉农对超额完成增产计划很有信心。新乡专区棉田已普遍锄过四遍至六遍，整枝打杈二、三次，比往年空枝少，棉桃多，估计每亩可收一百斤至二百斤。洛阳、濮阳、南阳等专区麦茬棉花也长得很好。其他晚秋作物，玉米正在吐缨，黄豆已开始开花结角。各地都在加强秋田的后期管理、改进收割方法和紧张进行防汛工作，保证秋季获得丰收。
    目前浙江省大部地区正是紧张的秋收秋种季节。全省今年早稻和早中稻共一千三百多万亩，大部已收割完毕，总产量可超过去年，很多县平均比去年增产一成到两成。全省四百多万亩中籼稻已进入灌浆黄熟阶段，再过半个月左右就可以收割，一般可望丰收。萧山县几万亩中籼稻估计可增产一成左右。全省一千三百多万亩晚稻大部已圆秆拔节，有的已开始孕穗。五百多万亩玉米、大豆、番薯等旱地杂粮作物大部已经成熟，并陆续开始收割。临海县十六万多亩杂粮作物可比去年增产。永嘉县几万亩番薯可比去年增产两成，多收八百多万斤。全省一百十七万亩棉花正在开花结桃，可以争取完成增产计划。四十七万亩络麻也生长旺盛，可超额完成增产计划。为了超额增产粮食，各地农民除努力做好收割工作，加强对现有作物的田间管理外，并在“一亩田当两亩用”、“多种一亩是一亩”等口号下，积极在休闲田中多种一熟作物。全省播种玉米、大豆、荞麦等晚秋作物的面积，将比去年扩大四百五十万亩。嘉兴专区和杭县一百多万亩早稻和中稻收割后，农民将普遍培育再生稻或种植晚稻。

    黑龙江省九十四万多公顷小麦，普遍获得丰收。据原松江省二十个县实产量的记载和普遍调查推算的结果，平均每公顷产量可达一千七百七十斤，较去年平均产量增加三百四十斤。原黑龙江省七个县的统计，平均每公顷产量一千八百三十六斤，较去年增加四百九十斤。
    龙江县产麦区后依力巴村平均产量达二千五百斤左右，这是由于该村全部进行了籽种消毒，并用新农具平播密植的结果。其次，该村不但所有麦地经过秋翻，而且在翻地前施了肥。
    宁安县三万五千多公顷小麦，平均每公顷收二千斤，主要原因是采用了早熟麦种。该县所采用“农林二十九号”麦种，比其它麦种缩短生长期十至十五天，因而避免了最易流行的?病。
    桦南县除增加用新农具平播的面积外，用旧农具播种的小麦也多数采取紧缩行距三分之一，或者把苗眼加宽一倍，因而使平均产量达二千二百七十斤。　（本报黑龙江记者站）

    中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产部队的夏收工作，于八月上旬基本结束。全军四十二万四千九百多亩小麦，普遍获得丰收，单位面积产量比去年又有了很大提高。玛纳斯垦区的十二万亩冬麦，每亩平均收到二百五十斤以上，比去年提高了一成半以上。乌鲁木齐垦区小麦的单位面积产量，比去年提高了一倍以上。焉耆垦区某部冬麦的单位面积产量，达到了四百斤，大大地超过了原来的计划产量。
    今年，新疆军区农业生产部队大部分用机器进行夏收。指战员们积极钻研创造，提高了割麦的工作效率。玛纳斯垦区某部的联合收割机收割效率一天达到二百八十亩，超过定额百分之六十二；“八一”农场等单位用拖拉机牵引三台马拉割麦机收割，最高一天能割三百亩到三百五十亩。由于充分发挥了机器的效能，大部分单位的麦子都在十天里面收割完毕。
