Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Colombo on the 5th, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu telegraphed Ceylonese Prime Minister Kotelawala on the evening of the 4th, stating that the Burmese government refuses to participate in the meeting the United States intends to hold in September to discuss cobbling together a Southeast Asian military bloc.

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: According to an AFP dispatch from Colombo, the Indonesian government has formally notified the Ceylonese government that Indonesia will absolutely not take any action related to the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" planned by Western countries. The Indonesian government's attitude was expressed to the Ceylonese government on the 7th through the Indonesian Chargé d'Affaires in Ceylon, de Fretes.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 8th: Kathmandu dispatch: Nepalese Foreign Minister Regmi said in Kathmandu on the 6th that he opposes the formation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. He cited the agreement on commerce and communication between China's Tibet region and India as an example, saying that if the principles of this agreement were applied to the relations between Asian countries, then the defense problems of this region would naturally be solved.

Regmi said that Asia should no longer become a playground for conflicting imperialist interests. "The interest of outsiders in the defense of this region will only arouse suspicion among the people. If there should be a defense arrangement in this region, then this arrangement should take the form of a collective peace treaty, which includes all countries in Southeast Asia, regardless of the form of government of these countries. This should be an internal arrangement, and should not be initiated by the United States, Britain, or any other outside country."

Regmi also expressed sympathy for the liberation movement of the Indian people in the French and Portuguese colonies in India. He said: "There is no place in the world today where the colonial system should be allowed to exist."

    缅甸总理和印尼政府分别通知锡兰政府
    拒绝参加讨论拼凑东南亚军事集团的会议
    尼泊尔外交大臣表示反对成立东南亚公约组织
    【新华社七日讯】据路透社科伦坡五日消息，缅甸总理吴努四日晚致电锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉，表示缅甸政府拒绝参加美国打算在九月份举行的讨论拼凑东南亚军事集团的会议。
   【新华社八日讯】据法新社科伦坡消息，印尼政府已经正式通知锡兰政府，印尼绝不采取同西方国家所策划的“东南亚公约组织”有关系的任何行动。印尼政府这种态度是在七日通过印尼驻锡兰代办德弗列斯特斯向锡兰政府表明的。
   【新华社新德里八日电】加德满都消息：尼泊尔外交大臣雷格米六日在加德满都说，他反对成立东南亚公约组织。他举出关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定为例说，如果把这个协定的原则应用到亚洲国家的关系中，那么这个地区的防御问题就自然而然会得到解决。
    雷格米说，亚洲不应当再成为互相冲突的帝国主义利益的游戏场。“外边的人对这个地区的防务发生兴趣只会使人民产生疑虑。如果这个地区应该有一种防御安排，那么这种安排也应该采取这样的形式：缔结一个集体和平公约，这个公约包括东南亚的所有国家，而不管这些国家的政府是什么形式。这应该是内部的安排，而不应该由美国、英国或任何其他外边的国家来发起。”
    雷格米也表示同情在印度的法国、葡萄牙属地中印度人民的解放运动。他说：“今天全世界都没有允许殖民制度存在的地方。”
