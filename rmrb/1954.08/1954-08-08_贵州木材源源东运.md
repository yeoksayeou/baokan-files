    Guizhou Timber Flows Eastward
    High-quality timber produced in Guizhou Province is being continuously rafted eastward from the Qingshui River in eastern Guizhou and the Duliu River in southern Guizhou to support construction needs in the Central South region. Since the first half of this year, the total amount of timber transported to Hunan and Guangxi provinces has exceeded 200,000 cubic meters. If this batch of timber were used to build houses, it could construct more than 2 million square meters of single-story office buildings; if used to make railway sleepers, it could lay more than 500 kilometers of railway.
    More than 90 percent of the fir timber produced in the eastern and southern regions of Guizhou Province comes from areas inhabited by the Miao people and is a well-known high-quality timber nationwide. Fir timber is solid, the trunks are straight, and the tallest can reach 30 meters in height. The tree's taper (the degree to which it gradually narrows from root to tip) is very small, so it is welcomed throughout the country and is the most suitable material for high-voltage power poles, high-altitude scaffolding, sailing masts, and large building beams and pillars. The biggest characteristic of fir timber is that it grows very quickly. The fastest can grow from seedlings into forests in eighteen years. Therefore, in places where cultivation is well-managed, it can be harvested and used in rotation without exhausting the source.

    贵州木材源源东运
    贵州省所产优良木材正自贵州省东部青水江及南部都柳江源源扎筏东运，支援中南各地建设需要。今年上半年以来，全部运到湖南及广西省的木材已超过二十万立方公尺。若用这批木材建筑房屋，可以筑成办公用平房二百余万平方公尺；用来制成枕木铺设铁路，可以铺五百多公里。
    贵州省东部和南部地区出产的杉材，百分之九十以上是出产在苗族人民居住地区，为全国著名的一种优良木材。杉材质地坚实，树身通直，最高的长达三十公尺，树子的梢杀度（由根至梢逐渐变细的程度）很小，因此受到全国各地的欢迎，是高压电线杆、高空支手架、江帆桅杆、大厦梁柱最适宜的材料。杉材的最大特点是生长得很快，最快的十八年就能从幼苗长大成林，因此在培养得宜的地方可以轮番采伐应用，不至断源。
