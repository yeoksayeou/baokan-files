Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Special Agent Captured

Yang Runsheng

On the evening of May 15th, the setting sun cast a golden glow on the greenstone peaks of the Kawa Mountains. The surrounding green forests were draped in a golden veil. Birds returning to their nests chirped happily as they flew across the sky, and wisps of bluish smoke drifted through the valleys. Farmers from the Dali Suo village who had been working in the fields were also returning to the village one after another. At this moment, everything seemed very peaceful on this border of our motherland, Yunnan.

The soldiers guarding the border of our motherland day and night were engaged in lively and cheerful extracurricular activities after a day of intense study. Some were playing cards, and some were playing basketball. I was taking a walk along the playground when suddenly a soldier ran up to me and said, "Report to the instructor, our squad leader asked you to come down the mountain. Just now, we found a suspicious person near the village." I didn't have time to ask for more details and quickly headed towards the village entrance. As I walked down the mountain, I saw the second squad leader interrogating a man. The man was wearing a tattered hat and a set of black trousers and a jacket. At first glance, he looked like a Kawa person. When he saw me approaching, he quickly took off his hat and bowed repeatedly, saying, "Officer, I'm a businessman, I'm a good person..." His hypocritical appearance made me more determined to question him closely.

He said that he came from a certain village, passing through here, intending to go to Ximeng to buy cloth. I thought that if he was going to Ximeng to buy cloth, the journey would be long, and he would definitely have to spend the night at a relative's house. So I asked, "Which family in Ximeng are you planning to stay with?"

"Looking for Huang Daosan." He hesitated and said, "Hey, hey, he's my relative." This immediately alerted me. Huang Daosan used to be a bandit and had only recently been won over. I was about to continue questioning him when Squad Leader Zhou Shiren interrupted, "Which village are you from?"

"Me?" He stuttered, "Originally from Ximeng, later--moved--now live in Mengga."

"Mengga?" I shook my head, indicating that it wasn't right, and said to him directly, "I often go to Mengga village, how come I've never seen you?" At this time, his expression was already a bit flustered. But he immediately argued, "I often go out to do business, I'm rarely at home." "Then, what's your name, who are the members of your family?" I pressed on. He swallowed, and I could see that he was trying hard to calm himself. He replied, "My name is Huang Yian, and I have two children." At this moment, groups of Lahu people from the village gathered around. Among them was an old woman who had moved here from the Munai area. She squeezed through the crowd, took a close look at this person who claimed to be a businessman, and exclaimed in surprise, "Aren't you Village Chief Huang! Good thing you're here!" "Instructor," she turned to me and said, as if appealing to me, "You can't let him go! He's the one who dragged my son off to be a soldier!" She trembled with anger and turned back abruptly to grab the man's chest, saying, "Where did you take my son, give me back my son..." His face turned as white as a sheet, and his hands and feet trembled involuntarily. Knowing that he couldn't deny it, he knelt down and begged, "Officer, spare my life! I was forced by Li Mi to become a bandit."

Later, detailed interrogation proved that this guy was originally from Munai Tianba. His real name was Huang Xunwu. He had been a Kuomintang puppet village chief in Tianba. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1951, he fled abroad in fear of punishment. Now he serves as an intelligence station chief in Li Mi's bandit gang. His purpose in coming to the Kawa Mountains this time was to gather military intelligence, provoke ethnic disputes, and conspire to assassinate our working cadres and progressive masses of fraternal ethnic groups. However, he did not escape the vigilance of the sentries and masses of our border troops and was captured as soon as he entered.

    蒋匪特务落网了
    杨润生
    五月十五日傍晚，晚霞映得佧佤山山峰上的青石金光闪闪，那远远近近的绿色林丛上，也披上了一层金色的轻纱，归巢的鸟儿愉快地叫着掠过天空，山谷间飘动着青色的炊烟。大力索寨子下地生产的农民也陆续回寨了。在这祖国云南的边防线上，此刻，一切都显得十分宁静。
    日夜守卫在祖国边防线上的战士们，经过一天的紧张学习以后，都在活泼愉快地进行课外活动，有的在打扑克，有的在打篮球。我正在沿着操场散步，突然一个战士跑来对我说：“报告指导员同志，我们班长请你下山去一趟。刚才，我们在寨子旁边发现了一个行迹可疑的人。”我没来得及再问底细，就赶快向寨口走去。当我走下山的时候，果然看见二班长正在盘问一个人。那人头戴一顶破旧的帽子，身穿一套黑色的裤褂，乍看，很像个佧佤人。他见我走过来，赶忙摘下帽子，连连点头哈腰地对我说：“官长，我是个生意人，没错，是好人……。”瞧他这种虚伪的样子，使我更加紧了对他的盘问。
    他说他是从某寨来的，经过这里，打算去西盟买布。我想他去西盟买布，路途远，一定要在熟人家过夜才行。于是我问：“你打算在西盟那家过夜？”
    “找黄道三。”它犹豫了一下说：“嘿，嘿，他是我老俵。”这使我立刻警惕起来，黄道三过去当过土匪，是不久前才被争取回来的。我正想继续追问下去，班长周士仁插嘴问道：“你是那个寨的人？”
    “我吗？”他吞吞吐吐地答道：“原是西盟，后来——搬了——现在住猛嘎。”
    “猛嘎？”我摇摇头表示不对，并照直对他说：“猛嘎寨我常去，怎么一次也没见过你？”这时，他的神情已有点慌恐不安了。但是他立刻又辩解说：“我经常出外做生意，在家的时间少。”“那么，你叫什么名字，家里有那些人？”我紧追着问。他吞了一口唾沫，我看得出这是他在极力镇定自己。他答道：“我叫黄宜安，家里有两个孩子。”这时，寨子里一群群的拉祜族人都围拢上来，其中有个老大妈，她是从慕乃一带搬到这里落户的。她从人群中挤进来，对住这个自称是做生意的人仔细一瞧，吃惊地叫着：“你不是黄乡长吗！你来的好啊！”“指导员，”她转身向我申诉似地说：“可不能放走他呀！就是他把我儿子拉去当兵的呀！”她气的浑身打颤，猛地又回过头来一把将那人的胸口拉住说：“你把我儿子拉到那里去了，你还我的儿子来……”他的脸色顿时变得像一张白纸，手脚不由得哆嗦起来。他知道抵赖不过，就双腿跪倒央求道：“官长，饶了我这条命吧！我是让李弥逼迫着当土匪的。”
    后来经过详细审讯证明：这家伙原来是慕乃田坝人，真名叫黄训伍，曾经在田坝当过国民党的伪乡长，一九五一年镇压反革命时，他畏罪潜逃境外，现在李弥匪部担任情报站长，这次他来佧佤山的目的，是刺探军情，挑拨民族纠纷，并阴谋刺杀我工作干部和兄弟民族的进步群众。可是，他没有逃出我边防部队哨兵和群众的警觉的眼睛，刚刚进来就落网了。
