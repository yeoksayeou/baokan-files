The Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute of the Central Ministry of Light Industry has successfully trial-produced dehydrated vegetables. In the future, people in areas where vegetables do not grow can also eat delicious vegetables.

Fresh vegetables shrink in volume and decrease in weight after dehydration, making them easy to transport over long distances. For example, fifty pounds of fresh cabbage weighs only two and a half pounds after dehydration, and the volume is like a tea brick. Dehydrated vegetables still retain most of the nutritional value of fresh vegetables, and if stored in sealed containers, the nutritional value will not disappear after one year, and the color of the vegetables will not change much. When dehydrated vegetables are soaked in water, the color is still fresh and green, and they taste almost like fresh vegetables.

After dehydrated vegetables are produced in large quantities, in addition to being transported to remote areas where vegetables are not suitable for growing, they can also regulate the seasonality of vegetables. For example, in the hot summer, people can eat spinach and carrots, etc., and in winter, they can also eat green peppers, etc.

    脱水蔬菜试验成功
    中央轻工业部上海工业试验所试制脱水蔬菜成功。今后，不生长蔬菜地区的人民也可吃到鲜美的蔬菜了。
    新鲜蔬菜脱水后体积变小，重量减轻，便于长途运输。如五十斤新鲜卷心菜，脱水后重量只有二斤半，体积好像一块茶砖。脱水蔬菜仍能保有鲜菜中绝大部分的营养价值，而且装在密闭的器具中，一年后营养价值不会消失，蔬菜的颜色变化也不大。脱水蔬菜浸在水中，颜色仍然鲜嫩碧绿，吃起来与鲜菜差不多。
    脱水蔬菜大量生产后，除了可运送到不适宜生长蔬菜的边远地区外，还可以调节蔬菜的季节性。如炎热的夏天，人们可以吃到菠菜和胡萝卜等，而在冬天，也可以吃到青辣椒等。
