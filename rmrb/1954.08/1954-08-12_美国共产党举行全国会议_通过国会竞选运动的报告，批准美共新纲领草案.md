Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 11th: According to a report by the New York "Daily Worker" of TASS, the National Convention of the Communist Party of the United States was held from August 6th to 8th. One hundred and fifty representatives from local party organizations in twenty-four states attended the meeting.

The "Daily Worker" said that the meeting passed the report on the 1954 Congressional campaign presented by Pettis Perry, a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party, approved the draft of the new program of the Communist Party of the United States, and passed some suggestions on stepping up the movement to win amnesty for political prisoners. It agreed to nominate Elizabeth Gurley Flynn as a candidate for Congress and decided to strive for other Communist Party members to participate in the election.

The "Daily Worker" said that Perry's report on the election stated that people were deeply dissatisfied with the Eisenhower government. Perry said, "The government's refusal to take remedial measures against the increasingly serious unemployment and declining income of farmers has further lost the support of workers, farmers, and black voters." Perry said that therefore, the current situation contains the possibility of "the Democratic Party winning a huge victory in November," but this possible victory is problematic because the Democratic Party has not learned the lessons of the 1952 election, "neither condemning the government's war plan nor condemning its surrender to McCarthyism."

Perry called for support for candidates who support the peaceful coexistence movement, agree to allow Chinese representatives to participate in the United Nations, and expand East-West trade. Regarding domestic policy, Perry advocated increasing the minimum wage, increasing support for farmers in terms of agricultural product prices, reducing taxes, and building more schools, hospitals, and housing.

Bertie Ganett reported on the draft of the new program of the Communist Party of the United States.

    美国共产党举行全国会议
    通过国会竞选运动的报告，批准美共新纲领草案
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约十日讯：纽约“工人日报”报道，美国共产党全国会议已在八月六日至八日举行。出席会议的有二十四个州地方党组织的一百五十名代表。
    “工人日报”说，会议通过了共产党全国委员会委员佩蒂斯·佩里提出的关于一九五四年国会竞选运动的报告，批准了美国共产党的新纲领草案；通过了加紧推进争取大赦政治犯运动的一些建议，同意推举伊丽莎白·葛莱·弗林为国会议员候选人，并决定努力争取其他共产党员参加竞选。
    “工人日报”说，佩里关于竞选的报告说，人们对艾森豪威尔政府深为不满。佩里说，“政府拒绝对日益严重的失业现象和农民收入下降的现象采取补救措施更加失去了工人、农民和黑人选民的拥护。”佩里说，因此，目前形势中包含着“民主党在十一月取得巨大胜利”的可能性，但这种可能的胜利是有问题的，因为民主党没有吸取一九五二年选举的教训，“既没有谴责政府的战争计划，又没有谴责它对麦卡锡主义的屈服”。
    佩里要求对凡是支持和平共处运动、赞成让中国代表参加联合国和扩大东西方贸易的候选人予以支持。关于国内政策，佩里主张增加最低限度的工资、提高对农民在农产品价格方面的支持、削减赋税、增建学校、医院和住宅。
    伯蒂·甘内特就美国共产党的新纲领草案作了报告。
