Wuhan people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the strong support of all parts of the country, have been waging a tenacious struggle against the flood since June. Up to now, although the water level of the Yangtze River at the Wuhan Customs still exceeds the highest historical level, the dikes of Wuhan City still stand firm, and production in the city continues as usual. Now the people of the whole city are continuing to fight for the final victory over the flood.

    To reduce the impact of wind and waves on the dike, a huge wave-breakwater of wood piles has been built outside the Zhanggong Dike.

    During the flood season, Wuhan City has stored a large amount of materials to ensure supplies in all aspects. This is the coal transported from the Jiaozuo Coal Mine by the Wuhan Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company.

    The people of Wuhan City are now continuing a tenacious struggle against the flood. This is Zhanggong Dike in the northern suburbs of Hankou, where more than 300 water pumps are draining the accumulated water from inside the dike.
