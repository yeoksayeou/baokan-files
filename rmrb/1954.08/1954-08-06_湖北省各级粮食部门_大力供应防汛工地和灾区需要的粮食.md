    Hubei Province Grain Departments at All Levels
    Vigorously Supply Grain Needed for Flood Control Worksites and Disaster Areas
    Grain departments at all levels in Hubei Province are actively supplying grain needed for flood control worksites and areas affected by flooding. Since July, grain departments across the province have been carrying out grain allocation work with mutual support and mutual adjustment. According to preliminary statistics, Xiangyang Special District has already transferred 5.96 million jin of grain to Jingzhou Special District to support disaster-stricken areas such as Mianyang and Honghu counties. Within Jingzhou Special District, in the first half of July, more than 15 million jin of grain were transferred from Songzi, Tianmen, Zhongxiang and other counties to Mianyang, Honghu, Jianli and other counties. Xiaogan Special District and Huanggang Special District also adjusted grain supplies between disaster areas and non-disaster areas. In mid-July, Ximakou in Hanchuan County urgently needed grain. Cadres of the County Grain Bureau overcame the difficulties of the rapid flow of the Han River and the lack of tugboats for transportation, and promptly transported 150,000 jin of grain from the urban area. Staff at the Hankou Grain Station in Hubei Province, with the concentrated participation of porters in flood control, completed the loading of 1.4 million jin of rice and 100,000 jin of flour onto ships within sixteen hours, promptly supplying the needs of the industrial and mining areas of Huangshi City. Processing departments in various places actively improved production efficiency. Xiaogan and Huangpi counties processed 150,000 jin of rice per day to support the disaster areas of Hanchuan and Hanyang.
    During this period, the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government and the Food Bureau of the Central and South Administrative Council transferred tens of millions of jin of grain from Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces to Hubei, which played a significant role in ensuring grain supply and boosting the confidence of the masses in overcoming floods.

    湖北省各级粮食部门
    大力供应防汛工地和灾区需要的粮食
    湖北省各级粮食部门积极供应防汛工地和遭受水灾地区需要的粮食。七月份以来，全省粮食部门开展了互相支援、互相调剂的粮食调拨工作。根据初步统计，襄阳专区已经调给荆州专区五百九十六万斤粮食，支援沔阳、洪湖等县遭受水灾地区。荆州专区内部在七月上半月，从松滋、天门、锺祥等县调出粮食一千五百多万斤，运到沔阳、洪湖、监利等县。孝感专区和黄冈专区也在灾区和非灾区之间调剂了粮食。汉川县系马口在七月中旬曾经一度迫切需要粮食，县粮食局的干部设法克服了汉江水流湍急和没有拖轮载运的困难，及时从城关运去十五万斤粮食。湖北省汉口运粮站的工作人员在搬运工人集中参加防汛的情况下，在十六小时内突击完成了一百四十万斤大米和十万斤面粉的装船任务，及时供应了黄石市工矿区的需要。各地加工部门积极提高生产效率。孝感、黄陂两县就曾经每天加工十五万斤大米，支援汉川、汉阳灾区。
    中央人民政府粮食部和中南行政委员会粮食局在这个期间，从四川、广东、广西等省调到湖北几千万斤粮食，对保证粮食供应、鼓舞群众战胜洪水的信心起了很大作用。
