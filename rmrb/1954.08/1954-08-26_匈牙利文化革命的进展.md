    Progress of the Hungarian Cultural Revolution
    Georgi Bálaki, Member of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic
    Kossuth Prize Winner Georgi Bálaki
    The Hungary of the past was called a "spiritual resort" by progressive writers and poets, and the teachers who taught children to write and read were called "odd jobbers in the country," because the old regime particularly hated the people and culture. At that time, the ruling class feared nothing more than the development of workers' and peasants' education and the expansion of their knowledge. Because after they were educated, they would understand that they were being exploited and deprived of all rights, and would use the weapon of knowledge to fight for freedom and more reasonable living conditions.
    The most significant achievement of the Hungarian cultural revolution lies in the abolition of the privileged status of the ruling class in the cultural field. The Constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic clearly declares that the working people have the right to education and to develop their national culture.
    This article of the Constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic has been specifically realized in recent years; and the cultural revolution has brought an unprecedented prosperity to the cultural life of the Hungarian people. Since the liberation of our country, not only the light of electric lamps, but also the spiritual and cultural light in the hearts of industrial workers, miners, and peasants has illuminated countless Hungarian villages. No matter how remote, there is not a single Hungarian village where you cannot find a library—a source of intelligence. In addition to schools, cultural centers and cultural halls can be found in most Hungarian villages, where adults gather and organize reading groups. In these cultural halls, local amateur drama groups often perform plays, ancient national dances, and sing ancient songs from centuries ago. The most important new films from Hungary, the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, and Italy are shown in the cities at the same time, and are also shown here for the residents of the villages.
    Hungarian writers often visit rural reading groups. They often recite their works to enthusiastic audiences, and make reports on outstanding figures in Hungarian progressive literature and comment on the works of foreign progressive writers and poets. Specially organized traveling theater troupes often visit the countryside. The cultural revolution is particularly committed to the development of the independent culture of ethnic minorities living in Hungary. The activities of cultural groups of Slovak, Yugoslav, and Germanic peoples receive moral and economic assistance from the government and local authorities.
    The popularization of the Hungarian cultural revolution in the countryside is most intense in the winter months, because at that time the peasants have more leisure than in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons when they have to work in the fields.
    The effects of the cultural revolution in the countryside are immeasurable. The Hungarian people's cultural revolution has dispelled centuries of mental darkness and shattered evil superstitions. Its effects in the countryside are also manifested in other aspects. Thousands of rural children have entered universities, colleges, and various agricultural technical schools in the past few years, which they were barred from in the old regime. Today, the government helps the children of farmers obtain diplomas as agronomists, engineers, physicists, and teachers in universities and colleges with scholarships. For them, this harvest was only an unattainable wish in the past.
    The cultural revolution is also displayed in the cities with brilliant achievements and huge numbers. Taking the issue of youth, the issue of the new Hungarian intellectuals, it must be pointed out that during the Horthy reactionary regime, the proportion of university and college students was sixteen out of every 10,000 Hungarian residents, of which more than 80% were children of the ruling class. Currently, this ratio is fifty-one out of every 10,000 residents, that is to say, it has exceeded the level of the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, or Denmark. In the Hungarian People's Republic, the number of university and college students is five times the number of students before the Second World War. The number of primary and secondary school students has tripled. Now, the majority of students in universities, colleges, and secondary schools are children of workers and peasants. In order to eliminate some of the backward phenomena manifested in the development of primary schools, some teaching measures have been taken.
    These figures prove that the effects of the Hungarian cultural revolution can be felt personally in the broad strata of the working masses and in the intellectual strata with higher education.
    Hungarian literature, art, music, and science have never reached such a level of prosperity, popularity, and appreciation by the masses as they do now. Under the old regime, Hungary could hardly be called a country with books. Profit-seeking capitalist bookstores only tried to cater to the decadent tastes of the rich, as did capitalist theater managers and cinema owners. At that time, a book in a worker's or peasant's home was as rare as a white crow. Workers or peasants rarely went to theaters or cinemas, and concerts, art galleries, or opera houses were forbidden to them. Today, there are many industrial workers among the audience of the opera house. Although more opera houses and theaters have been established in Hungary than in the past, it is still difficult to get a ticket for an opera or a play. Nothing can better illustrate the cultural situation of a country than the number of books published. Nothing can better illustrate the promotion of the Hungarian cultural revolution and its fundamental difference from the uncultured and dull past than the following figures: In 1938, 8,152 works were printed in Hungary with a total circulation of 17,272,000 copies, while in 1953, 18,767 works were published with a total circulation of 51,079,000 copies. Another fact that suffices to illustrate the rapid improvement of the Hungarian people's knowledge level is that the number of radio users was 419,000 in 1938, while today, in Hungary with a population of 9.5 million, it has exceeded 1.1 million.
    Hungarian writers, poets, composers, film directors, actors, amateur artists, or sculptors have never been as familiar and welcome to the broad masses as they are today. Because the people can appreciate the feelings, thoughts, desires, and heroic struggles in their lives from their works. These works have been given to the broad masses as a symbol of the Hungarian cultural revolution.
    The working people and the people of Hungarian literature are proud that our two writers—Damás Ádám and Sándor Nagy—have won the highest literary honor, the Stalin Prize.
    Millions of people from all walks of life visited the exhibition of works by Munkácsy, Hungary's greatest classical painter.
    Our film art, which has continuously won victories in great international film festivals, on the one hand reflects the transformed forms of Hungarian people's lives, reflecting the freedom gained and new heroic deeds, and on the other hand is taken from the classic works of the greatest Hungarian freedom fighters—Lajos Kossuth and Petőfi. However, in addition to our achievements, we also have serious shortcomings. One of them is that the quality of popular literature and art cannot yet reach the desired standard. This issue has recently become the center of debate in our cultural life, and we are working to eliminate these shortcomings. The Hungarian people and the government care for and respect the writers, artists, and scientists who stand at the forefront of the Hungarian cultural revolution. On March 15th—the glorious anniversary of the War of Independence in 1848—the Hungarian People's Republic awards the Kossuth Prize to outstanding writers, actors, scientists, painters and sculptors, rural school teachers and superior medical professors, miners on the production front, individual farmers, and outstanding workers of state enterprises and agricultural cooperatives, to express the highest award to them. The Hungarian cultural revolution is a constructive and educational revolution, a frank and sincere expression of great national unity, strong patriotism, and the Hungarian people's love of peace. This cultural revolution is breathing, it is sunshine, it is our great realization and aspiration for a new socialist life.

    匈牙利文化革命的进展
    匈牙利人民共和国主席团委员

    过去的匈牙利被进步的作家和诗人称做是“精神上的休闲地”，而教孩子们初学写字读书的蒙师，被称为“国家里的散工”，因为旧政权是特别痛恨人民和文化的。那时候的统治阶级没有再比对工人和农民教育的发展和他们见识的扩大更加害怕的了。因为他们受教育后就会明白自己是被剥削和被剥夺了一切权利，并且会利用知识的武器来为争取自由和较合情理的生活条件而斗争。
    匈牙利文化革命中最重大的成就，是在于在文化方面也废除了统治阶级的特权地位。匈牙利人民共和国宪法明白地宣布了劳动人民享有教育和发展人民的与自己民族文化的权利。
    匈牙利人民共和国宪法的这一条文，近年来已具体地实现了；而文化革命已给匈牙利人民的文化生活带来了一个空前未有的繁荣。自从我国解放以来，不仅是电灯的光亮，而且是产业工人、矿工和农民心中的精神上和文化上的光亮，照亮了无数的匈牙利村落。不论多么偏僻，没有一个匈牙利的村庄里找不到一个图书馆——智力的源泉。除了学校以外，文化中心和文化馆在大多数的匈牙利村庄里都可找到，成年人就在那里聚会并且组织阅读小组。在这些文化馆里，当地的业余戏剧小组常常演戏，表演古代的民族舞蹈，并且演唱几个世纪前的古代歌曲。匈牙利、苏联、中国、朝鲜、德国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、法国和意大利最主要的一些新影片在各城市放映的同时，也在这里为村庄里的居民放映。
    匈牙利的作家们时常访问乡村的阅读小组。他们时常向热情的听众朗诵自己的作品，作一些关于匈牙利进步文学中卓越人物的报告和评论外国进步作家与诗人的作品。时常有特别组织的旅行剧团下乡访问。文化革命特别致力于居住在匈牙利的少数民族独立文化的发展。斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫和日耳曼等族人民文化团体的活动，得到政府和地方当局道义上和经济上的援助。
    匈牙利文化革命在乡村中的普及，以在冬季的月份里最为紧张，因为那时候农民们比要下田工作的春、夏、秋三季有更多的闲暇。
    文化革命在乡村中所取得的效果是难以估量的。匈牙利人民的文化革命，已经驱散了多少世纪以来心智上的黑暗，并且粉碎了邪恶的迷信。它在乡村中的效果也表现在其他方面。成千的乡村儿童，在过去的几年中已经进入了在旧政权时代他们被拒于门外的大学、学院和各种农业技术学校。在今天，政府以助学金的办法，帮助农民的孩子们在大学和学院中得到农学家、工程师、物理学家和教师的毕业证书，对于他们，这种收获在过去只能是一个无法实现的愿望。
    文化革命也以辉煌的成就的巨大数字显示在城市之中。就以青年的问题，新的匈牙利知识分子的问题来说，必须指出，在霍尔第反动政权时代，大学和学院学生的比例是在每一万匈牙利居民中占十六人，其中百分之八十以上是统治阶级的子女。目前这个比例是在每一万居民中占五十一人，也就是说，已超过英国、法国、瑞典或丹麦的水平。在匈牙利人民共和国，大学和学院的学生人数已为第二次世界大战前学生人数的五倍。初等和中等学校的学生人数已增加到三倍。现在，大学、学院和中等学校学生中，大多数都是工人和农民子弟。为了消除在初等学校发展中所表现的某些落后现象，已经采取了教学上的一些措施。
    这些数字证明，匈牙利文化革命的效果，在劳动群众的广大阶层和在受到高等教育的知识分子阶层中，能够切身地感觉到了。
    匈牙利的文学、艺术、音乐和科学从没有达到过像现在这种昌盛和普及以及为群众所欣赏的程度。而在旧政权下，匈牙利是很难被称为有书籍的国家。唯利是图的资本家的书局，只设法迎合有钱人的颓废趣味，资本家的戏院经理和电影院老板们也是如此。在那个时候，一个工农家里的一本书，恰像是一只白乌鸦一样的稀罕。工人或农民们很少到戏院或电影院去，而音乐会、美术馆或者歌剧院对于他们是禁地。今天，歌剧院的观众中间有很多的产业工人。虽然在匈牙利已建立了比过去多得多的歌剧院和戏院，但弄到一张歌剧或戏剧的入场券还是很困难的事。最能说明一个国家的文化状况的莫过于书籍出版的数量。没有比用下面的数字更能说明匈牙利文化革命的推广以及它与无文化而沉闷的过去的天壤之别的了：在一九三八年，在匈牙利八千一百五十二种作品共印行了一千七百二十七万二千册，而在一九五三年，一万八千七百六十七种作品共刊印了五千一百零七万九千册。另外一种足以说明匈牙利人民知识水平迅速提高的事实是：收音机用户的数目，在一九三八年是四十一万九千，而今天在有着九百五十万人口的匈牙利，则已超过
  一百一十万了。
    匈牙利的作家、诗人、作曲家、电影导演、演员、业余艺术家或雕刻家，从没有过像今天这样为广大群众所熟悉和欢迎。因为人民从他们的作品中，体会到自己生活中的感情、思想、愿望和英勇的奋斗。这些作品已经作为匈牙利文化革命的标志而送给了广大的群众。
    匈牙利劳动人民的文学和人民都以我们的两个作家——达马斯·阿捷尔和山道尔·纳吉所获得的最高文学名望与斯大林奖金而感到自豪。
    社会各阶层的千百万人民参观了匈牙利最伟大的古典画家蒙卡奇的作品展览会。
    在伟大的国际电影节中连续获得胜利的我们的电影艺术，一方面是反映匈牙利人民生活的变革形式，反映了所获得的自由和新的英勇事迹，另一方面是取材自最伟大的匈牙利自由战士——拉约西·柯苏特和裴多菲的古典著作。然而我们除了成就，也有严重的缺点。其中之一就是大众文艺的质量还不能达到所希望的标准。这个问题最近已成为我们的文化生活争论的中心，我们正在致力于消除这些缺陷。匈牙利人民和政府以爱护和尊敬的心情，关怀着站在匈牙利文化革命前列的作家、艺术家和科学家。匈牙利人民共和国在三月十五日——光荣的一八四八年独立战争纪念日颁发柯苏特奖金给卓越的作家、演员、科学家、画家和雕刻家、乡村学校教师和优越的医学教授、生产战线上的矿工、个体农民和国家企业与农业合作社的优秀工人们，以表示对他们的最高的奖励。匈牙利文化革命，是个建设性的和教育上的革命，是伟大的民族团结、强烈的爱国主义和匈牙利人民热爱和平的一个坦率和真诚的表现。这个文化革命是呼吸，是阳光，是我们对新的社会主义生活的伟大实现和热望。
