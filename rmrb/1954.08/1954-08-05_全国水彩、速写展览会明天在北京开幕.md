National Watercolor and Sketch Exhibition Opens in Beijing Tomorrow

The "National Watercolor and Sketch Exhibition," sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association, is scheduled to be held at the Chengqian Palace of the Palace Museum in the capital from tomorrow (the 6th) to the 22nd of this month. A preview will be held this morning.

This exhibition is the result of five months of preparation. In March of this year, the Exhibition Department of the Chinese Artists Association began soliciting watercolor and sketch works from artists across the country. By the end of July, it had received more than 1,800 pieces. The Exhibition Department specially organized a selection committee, which, after many discussions, selected the 240-odd pieces currently on display from among these many works.

The authors of these works include famous and young painters from Beijing, Shanghai, and major administrative regions across the country, as well as art teachers, students, and some art enthusiasts. The themes and content of the works are quite extensive, and the styles and forms are relatively diverse. Among the watercolor portraits and figure sketches, those depicting workers and peasants are the most numerous, but there are also soldiers, sailors, fishermen, Young Pioneers, educated youth, veteran artists, and images of ethnic minorities such as "Tibetan People's Teachers," "Xinjiang Girls," "Dai Representatives," and "Miao Model Students"; Works depicting industrial construction and sketches of construction sites also occupy a significant number, such as "Steel Production," "Steel Factory Under Construction," "Repairing Locomotive Boilers," "Drilling Towers," and the huge scenes and collective labor scenes of Guanting Reservoir, Foziling Reservoir, Wuchang Shipyard construction site, and the Yangtze and Han River Bridge construction sites; in landscape paintings, almost all the famous scenic spots across the country are included, in addition to the Summer Palace, Beihai Park and other mountain and forest scenery in the suburbs of the capital, there are also West Lake, Dongting Lake, Taihu Lake, Jialing River, and the Suzhou River, People's Square, workers' new villages in Shanghai, Qingdao's seaside bathing beach, Kangding's Lama Temple, and the forests of the Northeast, and the fishing villages on the Yantai coast. These beautiful and lovely sceneries are all the objects of the painters' depictions. The exhibits also include sketches of birds and animals, and still life sketches of flowers and fruits.

It can be seen from this exhibition that painters generally can master the characteristics of tools, and adopt various techniques to freely express different objects, emotions, and atmospheres. Veteran watercolor painters such as Situ Qiao, Guan Guangzhi, Zhang Meisun, and Pan Sitong also participated in this exhibition. Traditional Chinese painters such as Li Xiongcai, Guan Shanyue, Pan Yun, and Chen Dayu used national traditional techniques to create many construction site sketches and landscape sketches. Korean sketches by Yan Han, Dai Ze, and Zong Qixiang are also on display. Other works include Li Hua, Zhang Ding, Li Hu's ink landscapes, Ai Zhongxin's oil sketches, Shao Yu's watercolor sketches, Zhang Wenxin and Wang Qi's pencil and charcoal sketches, and Wu Zuoren, Xiao Shufang, Zhao Qi and other works, each with its own unique style.

Through this exhibition, painters and audiences will have a further understanding and emphasis on watercolor paintings and sketches. Among the hundred flowers required to bloom in the field of painting, they will exert their characteristics and, like other various flowers, unfold their bright petals.

    全国水彩、速写展览会明天在北京开幕
    中国美术家协会主办的“全国水彩、速写展览会”，定于明天（六日）起至本月二十二日止，在首都故宫博物院承乾宫展出。今天上午举行预展。
    这个展览会，是经过了五个月的筹备而展出的。今年三月，中国美术家协会展览部，就开始向全国各地的画家征集水彩、速写作品，到七月底止，共收到了一千八百余件。该会展览部特地组织了评选委员会，经多次座谈讨论，才从这么许多作品中选定了现在展出的二百四十余件。
    这些作品的作者，包括北京、上海和全国各大行政区著名的和年青的画家，以及美术教师、学生和部分的美术爱好者。作品的题材内容，相当广泛，风格形式，也比较多样。水彩人像和人物速写中，以描写工人、农民的为最多，也有战士、海员、渔民、少年先锋队员、知识青年、老艺人，以及
  “藏族人民教师”、“新疆少女”、“傣族代表”、
  “苗族学习模范”等等兄弟民族的形象；描写有关工业建设的和工地写生的作品，也占着不小的数量。如“出钢”、“建设中的钢厂”、“修理机车锅炉”、“钻塔”，以及官厅水库、佛子岭水库、武昌造船厂工地、长江和汉水大桥工地等巨大的场面和集体的劳动情景；在风景画中，更几乎包括了全国各地的名胜，除了首都的颐和园、北海公园等和近郊的山林景色外，更有西湖、洞庭湖、太湖、嘉陵江，和上海的苏州河、人民广场、工人新村，青岛的海水浴场，康定的喇嘛寺以及东北的森林，烟台海滨的渔家等等，这些美丽可爱的风景，都是画家描绘的对象。展出作品中，还有鸟兽等动物写生和花果等静物写生。
    从这次展览可以看出，画家们一般都能掌握工具的特性，为表现各种不同的对象、情感和气氛，而采用各种不同的技法，自由挥写。水彩画老画家如司徒乔、关广志、张眉孙、潘思同等，这次也都有作品参加。国画家如黎雄才、关山月、潘韵、陈大羽等，运用民族的传统技法，作了不少工地速写和风景写生。彦涵、戴泽、宗其香等所作的朝鲜速写，也参加了展出。其他还有李桦、张仃、李斛等的水墨风景，艾中信的油画速写，邵宇的水彩速写，张文新和王琦等的铅笔和木炭速写，以及吴作人、萧淑芳、赵琦等的作品，都各有独特的风格。
    通过这次展览，画家和观众对于水彩画和速写，都将引起更进一步的认识与重视，在绘画领域内要求齐放的百花中，它们将发挥它们的特性，与其他各式各样的花朵一样，展开鲜艳的花瓣。
