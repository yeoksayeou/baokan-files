Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 3rd. The three-day meeting of the All-India Peace Council, which began in Calcutta on July 30, concluded on August 1. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution calling for a broad movement to support the five basic principles expounded in the joint statement of Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru. The resolution calls for September to be designated as Asian Solidarity Month, so that people from all walks of life across the country can strengthen their support for the five principles.

The opening meeting was held on July 30 under the chairmanship of the renowned novelist Dr. Mulk Raj Anand, attended by 1,500 delegates, observers, and invited guests.

Anand said: Today, the American conspiracy against Asia is an obvious reality. He called for active resistance to this conspiracy to defend peace and security in Asia.

The main resolution on Asian solidarity passed by the meeting called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Asian soil and the end of foreign rule. The resolution said that the Asian people can no longer tolerate the new conspiracy of imperialists to undermine Asian solidarity by establishing military blocs.

The resolution called for the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

The resolution called for a political solution to the Indochina issue without foreign interference and for the resumption of negotiations on the Korean issue.

The meeting also passed resolutions demanding the prohibition of hydrogen bombs and the immediate annexation of all foreign-occupied territories within India into India.

The meeting also sent a telegram to Indian Prime Minister Nehru, congratulating him and Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China on the five principles put forward in their joint statement.

The All-India Peace Council and its sponsored units, as well as groups and individuals supporting the Peace Council, pledge that, in cooperation with other organizations of the Indian people, they will organize a nationwide movement, based on the five fundamental principles included in the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India and the joint statement of the Premiers of China and Burma, to strive for Asian solidarity, peaceful cooperation, security and unity.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. According to TASS, Jakarta, 2nd: Indonesian newspapers, commenting on the U.S. provocative acts in the Hainan Island area of China, Syngman Rhee's visit to the United States, and the U.S. attempt to cobble together an aggressive bloc in Southeast Asia, called on the Indonesian people to be vigilant.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" wrote in its editorial: Just as the Soviet Union, China, and all progressive mankind are consolidating peace step by step, the American ruling clique is carrying out new provocations. The United States committed an act of aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Hainan Island area of China, while at the same time directing Syngman Rhee and other puppets who will soon gather in the Philippines to establish the so-called Southeast Asian group to carry out criminal activities. Indonesia and other countries that respect themselves have rejected the invitation (to join this group) and condemned the purpose of this group. However, conspiracies against Indonesia continue, and American and British officers constantly come to Indonesia. When the United States, Britain, and other countries held secret military conferences in Singapore, they paid special attention to Indonesia.

The editorial concluded by writing that all these events should arouse the vigilance of our people and government. Indonesia should work more bravely with other peace-loving countries to shatter the provocations of the aggressors and defend peace.

    开幕会议七月三十日在著名小说家穆尔克·拉志·阿南德博士主持下举行，出席会议的有代表、观察员和应邀出席的贵宾共一千五百人。
    阿南德说：今天，美国对亚洲的阴谋是明显的现实。他要求积极抵抗这种阴谋，以保卫亚洲的和平和安全。
    会议通过的关于亚洲团结的主要决议要求外国军队撤出亚洲土地并结束外国的统治。决议说，亚洲人民不能再容忍帝国主义者通过建立军事集团来破坏亚洲团结的新阴谋。
    决议要求恢复中国在联合国中的合法权利。
    决议要求在没有外国干涉的情况下求得印度支那的政治解决，并要求恢复朝鲜问题谈判。
    会议还通过要求禁止氢弹和立刻把印度国内所有外国占领的地区都归并印度等决议。
    会议还致电印度总理尼赫鲁，对他和中华人民共和国总理周恩来发表的联合声明中提出五项原则表示祝贺。
    全印和平理事会和它所赞助的单位，以及支持和平理事会的团体和个人都保证他们将在印度人民的其他组织的合作下，组织全国范围的运动，以中国和印度两国总理联合声明和中国和缅甸两国总理联合声明中所包括的五项基本原则为基础，争取亚洲的团结、和平合作、安全和团结一致。
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社雅加达二日讯：印尼报纸评论美国在中国海南岛地区的挑衅行为、李承晚的去美国以及美国企图在东南亚拼凑侵略集团时，号召印尼人民提高警惕。
    印尼“人民日报”在社论中写道：正当苏联、中国和全体进步人类一步一步地巩固着和平的时候，美国统治集团却在进行新的挑衅。美国在中国海南岛地区对中华人民共和国作了侵略行为，一面又指使李承晚和将在最近齐集在菲律宾建立所谓东南亚集团的其他傀儡进行罪恶活动。印尼和其他尊重自己的国家都拒绝了（参加这一集团的）邀请，并指责了这一集团的目的。但是，对印尼的阴谋诡计继续在进行，美国和英国的军官时时不断地前来印尼。美国、英国和其他国家在新加坡举行秘密军事会议时，特别注意印尼。
    社论最后写道，这一切事件应该引起我国人民和政府的戒心。印尼应该和其他爱好和平的国家更勇敢地去粉碎侵略者的挑衅，去保卫和平。
