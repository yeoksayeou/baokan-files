Xinhua News Agency, August 4th, Paris dispatch: French officials are particularly concerned about the increasingly tense situation in Morocco, according to TASS. French newspapers report that the scale of unrest in Morocco is growing, with clashes between demonstrators and military police occurring in many instances.

    The Moroccan people held demonstrations in Fez on the 2nd; on the 3rd, demonstrations were also held in Fez, Casablanca, and Petitjean. Many demonstrators were injured or killed in clashes with police. In many cases, police opened fire on the demonstrators. In some cities, demonstrators demanded the reinstatement of former Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef (Youssef was forced to abdicate by French colonialists in August last year because of his sympathy for the national independence movement). Martial law has been imposed in most of these cities.

    Paris newspapers fear that the situation in Morocco will become increasingly tense as the one-year anniversary of Youssef's removal (August 20th) approaches. In many cities in Morocco, the movement advocating Youssef's reinstatement is developing. According to "Le Monde", residents of Arab districts are prepared to hold strikes and work stoppages, which will affect not only commerce but also industrial enterprises and handicraft factories.

    "L'Humanité" published a call from the Moroccan Communist Party on the 4th, calling for an end to police terror and the commencement of negotiations based on the recognition of Morocco's independence and sovereignty.

    [Xinhua News Agency, July 7th] TASS, Paris, 6th dispatch: The situation in Morocco remains very tense.

    "Libération" reports: In Fez, the French colonial authorities used tear gas and weapons to deal with demonstrators. Armed police patrolled the streets constantly throughout the day. In the Arab district of this city, newspapers and other publications are prohibited from being distributed. According to evening news, the Moroccan people held another demonstration in Fez on the 5th.

    In Casablanca, all entrances and exits to the Arab district and all major avenues within the city are guarded by large contingents of police. The Casablanca garrison is prepared to move out at any time. Due to a dockworkers' strike, activity at the port of Casablanca has come to a standstill.

    According to Paris newspaper reports, the movement demanding the reinstatement of former Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef continues to grow in Morocco.

    摩洛哥局势越来越紧张
    据新华社讯：据塔斯社巴黎四日讯：法国官方人士对摩洛哥日益紧张的局势特别感到不安。据法国报纸报道，摩洛哥的骚动规模越来越大，在许多场合下，示威群众和军警发生冲突。
    摩洛哥人民二日在非斯举行了示威；三日，又在非斯、卡萨布兰卡和普蒂然举行了示威。由于和警察发生冲突，示威者有许多人伤亡。在许多场合中，警察都开枪射击参加示威的人。有些城市的示威者要求前苏丹西迪·穆罕默德·本·优素福复位（优素福因同情民族独立运动，在去年八月被法国殖民者强迫退位）。这些城市大都实行了戒严。
    巴黎报纸担心：由于优素福被废一周年的日子（八月二十日）一天天临近，摩洛哥局势会愈来愈紧张。在摩洛哥许多城市里，主张优素福复位的运动正在发展。据“世界报”报道，阿拉伯区的居民已经准备举行罢市和罢工，这不但会影响商业，同时还影响到工业企业和手工业工厂。
    “人道报”在四日发表了摩洛哥共产党的呼吁书，呼吁书要求停止警察恐怖，并且在承认摩洛哥的独立和主权的基础上开始谈判。
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎六日讯：摩洛哥局势仍然十分紧张。
    “解放报”报道：在非斯，法国殖民当局用催泪弹和武器来对付示威者。武装警察整天不停地在街道上巡逻。在这个城市的阿拉伯区，报纸及其他出版物一律禁止发行。据晚报消息，摩洛哥人民五日在非斯又举行了示威。
    在卡萨布兰卡，阿拉伯区的一切出入口和城内一切大道都由大队警察戒备着。卡萨布兰卡的警备部队已经准备好随时出动。由于码头工人罢工，卡萨布兰卡港口活动陷于停顿。
    据巴黎报纸消息，要求前苏丹西迪·穆罕默德·本·优素福复位的运动在摩洛哥继续发展。
