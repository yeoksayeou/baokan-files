    U.S. Senate Passes Resolution Declaring CPUSA Illegal

    [Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 14th] The U.S. Senate passed a bill on August 12th declaring the Communist Party of the United States illegal and further persecuting the people. This bill was introduced as an amendment to the "Subversive Activities Control Act" bill, with the aim of expanding the scope of this act. This decision by the Senate will take effect after it is discussed and passed by the House of Representatives and approved by Eisenhower.

    The bill passed by the Senate to outlaw the Communist Party of the United States stipulates that any American who voluntarily joins the Communist Party of the United States, continues to be a member of the Communist Party of the United States, or takes any action to realize the Communist Party of the United States' policies of maintaining peace and the interests of the American people, shall be sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of ten thousand U.S. dollars. The bill also stipulates that members of the Communist Party of the United States shall not hold positions in trade union organizations, and trade unions designated by the U.S. authorities as "Communist-controlled" shall not enjoy collective bargaining rights.

    The bill also stipulates that any other organization can be declared illegal under the charge of so-called "attempting to overthrow the U.S. government." This means that any organization or individual that opposes the U.S. government's war policy and strives for peace and democracy will be subject to further persecution.

    Following Eisenhower's call in his State of the Union address to this Congress at the beginning of this year to strengthen domestic fascist rule, the fascist forces in the United States have become increasingly rampant. Many members of Congress and Attorney General Brownell have successively submitted to Congress various bills to strengthen fascism, many of which have been passed in Congress. Therefore, some have called this Congress a fascist Congress. The bill to ban the Communist Party of the United States passed by the Senate this time is a climax, and its purpose is to pave the way for the U.S. government to implement overall fascist rule.

    美国参议院竟通过宣布美共非法的决议
    【新华社十四日讯】华盛顿消息：美国参议院八月十二日通过了一个宣布美国共产党为非法和进一步迫害人民的法案。这一项法案是作为对关于修改“颠覆活动管制法”法案的修正案提出的，目的在扩大这个法案的范围。参议院这一决定将在众议院讨论通过和艾森豪威尔批准后生效。
    参议院通过的取缔美国共产党的这项法案规定，凡是自愿加入美国共产党或继续是美国共产党党员、或者为了实现美国共产党维护和平和美国人民利益的政策而采取任何行动的美国人民，都要被判处五年徒刑和一万美元的罚金。法案并规定美国共产党党员不得在工会组织中担任职务，被美国当局指为“被共产党控制”的工会不得享有集体谈判权。
    法案还规定，任何其他组织都可以在所谓“企图推翻美国政府”的罪名下被宣布为非法。这就是说，任何反对美国政府战争政策的、争取和平民主的组织和人士都将遭受进一步的迫害。
    继今年年初艾森豪威尔在提交本届国会的国情咨文中发出加强国内法西斯统治的号召后，美国的法西斯势力就越来越嚣张起来了，许多国会议员和司法部长布朗纳尔接连不断地向国会提出了形形色色的加强法西斯化的法案，其中许多法案并已在国会中获得通过，因此，曾有人把本届国会称为法西斯化的国会。这一次参议院通过的禁止美国共产党的法案是一个高峰，其目的是为美国政府实行全盘法西斯统治开辟道路。
