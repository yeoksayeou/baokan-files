The Beijing Municipal People's Government, based on national needs and the application of capitalists, has approved the transformation of Beijing Tongrentang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop into a joint state-private enterprise. On the morning of the 27th, over 280 employees of the shop, along with representatives of the public and private shareholders, held a celebration meeting. At the meeting, representatives of the public and private shareholders signed the joint state-private enterprise agreement. According to the agreement, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Local Industry Bureau (public shares) will invest and manage the business, and Mr. Le Songsheng, representing the private shareholders, was appointed as the general manager. One person from the public shares and two from the private shares will serve as deputy managers.

All the employees of Tongrentang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop welcomed the enterprise embarking on the path of state capitalism with unparalleled excitement. During the preparation stage for the joint state-private enterprise, more than a dozen workers completely cleared out twenty-four warehouses in one and a half days, providing favorable conditions for the upcoming asset inventory work. The employees unanimously expressed that in the asset inventory work, they would ensure that production and inventory are carried out simultaneously, and guarantee that the asset inventory is fair and reasonable, without exaggeration, understatement, duplication, or omission. Now, the unity among all the shop's technicians and workers, young workers and older workers, male workers and female workers has been greatly strengthened compared to the past. Li Dongchen, a 60-year-old worker in the ginseng and tonic department, said that he would sort out all the experience he has accumulated over the past forty years and pass it on to the young workers.

Tongrentang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop has a history of more than 280 years and is currently the largest traditional Chinese medicine shop in Beijing. It mainly deals in prepared medicines such as pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs, and can produce more than 500 kinds of prepared medicines, some of which are sold throughout the country. After liberation, the business of Tongrentang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop has developed year by year. The annual turnover in 1950 was more than 5.2 billion yuan, which increased to more than 19.5 billion yuan last year. Last year's annual net profit increased three times compared with 1950, and the net profit in the first half of this year exceeded the entire year of 1952. However, there are many shortcomings in business management, such as a lack of planning in production and serious waste, resulting in high costs and expensive prices. Some patients have reflected that while they can afford to be treated, they cannot afford to buy Chinese medicine. The variety and quality of medicines also cannot keep up with social needs. In recent years, the capitalists of Tongrentang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop have realized that private capitalist enterprises can only have a bright future and further adapt to the needs of the country and the people by taking the path of state capitalism. Therefore, all shareholders unanimously agreed to apply to the People's Government for the implementation of joint state-private enterprise. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京市同仁堂国药店改为公私合营
    北京市人民政府根据国家需要和资本家的申请，批准北京市同仁堂国药店实行公私合营。二十七日上午，全店二百八十多名职工和公、私股代表举行了庆祝大会。会上，公、私股代表在公私合营协议书上签了字。根据协议，北京市人民政府地方工业局（公股）投资经营，并确定私股代表乐松生为正经理，另由公股一人私股二人分别担任副经理。
    同仁堂国药店全体职工都以无比兴奋的心情，欢迎企业走上国家资本主义道路。在公私合营的筹备阶段，十多个工人在一天半内把二十四个仓库全部清理完毕，给即将开始的清理资产工作准备了有利条件。职工们一致表示，在清理资产工作中，一定作到生产、清点两不误，并保证清理资产时作到公平合理，不扩大、不缩小、不重复、不漏报。现在，全店技术人员和工人、青年工人和老年工人、男工和女工的团结比过去大大加强。参茸部六十岁的老工人李栋臣表示要把自己四十多年积累的经验全部整理出来，传授给年轻工人。
    同仁堂国药店有二百八十多年历史，目前是北京市最大的国药店。它以经营丸散膏丹等成药为主，能生产成药五百种以上，有些成药还行销全国各地。解放后，同仁堂国药店的业务逐年发展。一九五零年全年营业额为五十二亿多元，去年已增加到一百九十五亿元以上；去年全年纯益比一九五零年增加了三倍，今年上半年纯益又超过了一九五二年全年。但是，经营管理有很多缺点，生产缺乏计划，浪费现象严重，因此成本高，价格贵。有些病患者反映：能治起病，吃不起中药。在药的品种和质量上，也赶不上社会需要。同仁堂国药店的资本家近年来已体会到私人资本主义企业只有走国家资本主义道路才有光明前途，才能进一步适应国家和人民的需要。因此，全体股东一致同意向人民政府申请实行公私合营。　（新华社）
