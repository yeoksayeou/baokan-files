    German Socialist Unity Party Central Committee Sends Letter to French Communist Party Central Committee
    Hoping German and French People Will Jointly Stop West German Rearmament
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 28th] (TASS) "Neues Deutschland" published a letter from the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party to the Central Committee of the French Communist Party.

    The letter said: The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party hopes that the people of Germany and France will establish new, solid, and friendly relations on the basis of trust and mutual respect. The people of our two countries should never fight each other again. The people of our two countries should never allow themselves to be drawn into imperialist adventures.

    The letter pointed out: West German militarists eager for revenge are planning to rearm and intend to oppose other countries. Therefore, the struggle against aggressive alliances (the "European Defense Community" is such an alliance) is urgently needed by both Germany and France. Despite the conspiracies of all kinds of politicians to stop the patriotic protest movements on both sides of the Rhine against the realization of the "European Defense Community," they cannot divert people's attention from the danger of West German militarization.

    The letter emphasized: "Arming German militarists, no matter in what form, is the greatest danger to peace in Europe, therefore, we must never allow this to happen."

    The letter then pointed out: The working people of the German Democratic Republic follow the legacy of Ernst Thälmann, and their struggle to defend peace inspires all peace-loving people in West Germany to fight against the government of German monopoly capitalists and militarists, against the government that implements the "European Defense Community" policy.

    The letter concluded: The French working people have responded to the politicians who support the "European Defense Community," and this response demonstrates the ardent desire of all peace-loving people for peace and the guarantee of European security. We believe that peaceful coexistence of European countries in a collective security system is not only possible, but will become a reality.

    德国统一社会党中央致函法共中央
    希望德法两国人民共同制止西德重新武装
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十八日讯：“新德意志报”刊载了德国统一社会党中央委员会写给法国共产党中央委员会的一封信。
    这封信说：德国统一社会党中央委员会希望德、法两国人民在信任和互相尊重的基础上建立新的、巩固的和友好的关系。我们两国人民应该永远彼此不作战。我们两国人民应该永远不让自己牵进帝国主义的冒险中。
    这封信指出：渴望复仇的西德军国主义者正在打算重新武装起来，并且打算反对其他国家，因此，反对侵略同盟（“欧洲防务集团”就是这样一种同盟）的斗争不论对德国或是对法国都有迫切的需要。尽管各色各样的政客阴谋制止莱因河两岸反对实现“欧洲防务集团”的爱国抗议运动，可是他们并不能转移人们对西德军国主义化危险的注意。
    这封信着重指出：“武装德国军国主义者，不论在什么形式下进行，都是对欧洲和平的最大危险，因此，我们绝不容许这样作。”
    这封信接着指出：德意志民主共和国的劳动人民遵循恩斯特·台尔曼的遗训，他们保卫和平的斗争鼓舞了西德所有爱好和平的人，使他们进行斗争反对德国垄断资本家和军国主义者的政府，反对执行“欧洲防务集团”政策的政府。
    这封信最后说：法国劳动人民对支持“欧洲防务集团”的政客们给予了答复，这个答复表现出所有爱好和平的人对于和平和保障欧洲安全的热烈的愿望。我们相信：欧洲各国在集体安全体系中和平共处不仅是可能的，而且是会成为现实的。
