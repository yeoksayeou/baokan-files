To crush the sabotage activities of the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents, and to safeguard national construction and the safety of the people, the Guangdong Provincial People’s Court executed special agent bandits who snuck ashore.
[By Our Newspaper] The People's Public Security Organs and Border Defense Forces in the coastal areas of Guangdong Province annihilated a group of armed special agents who had sneaked ashore from the sea on January 19 this year, and captured ten special agent bandits including He Kui. After detailed interrogation, the Guangdong Provincial People's Court recently sentenced ten bandits including He Kui to death.

This group of armed special agents sneaked ashore at Huanghua Bay, Shazui Township, Yangjiang County on the Guangdong coast on the night of January 18. They were immediately discovered by the Shazui Township militia. Local public security organs and border defense forces immediately took measures to encircle and suppress this group of landed special agent bandits. The militia and people in the Shazui Township area also actively participated in the encirclement and suppression. Because the bandits opened fire and resisted arrest, we immediately engaged them in battle. As a result, in addition to one bandit who surrendered voluntarily, six bandits were shot and killed on the spot, and ten were captured alive. All the bandits were wiped out. We also seized 13 submachine guns, 4 carbines, 15 pistols, 2,250 rounds of ammunition, 4 sets of telegram codes, 2 radio stations, 10 packs of explosives, 3 boxes of detonators, as well as criminal evidence of counter-revolutionary activities such as "Armed Struggle Plan" and "Air Drop Plan".

After interrogation and investigation of the arrested special agent elements, it has been determined that this group of special agent bandits is mostly composed of die-hard counter-revolutionaries such as former Kuomintang military and political officials, veteran special agents, bandits, landlords and local despots. During the liberation of Guangdong and the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement in 1951, they successively fled to Hong Kong and Macau to escape punishment, and were immediately taken in by the special agent organization "Free China Movement" under the leadership of the US special agent headquarters "Central Intelligence Agency" in Hong Kong and Macau. Among them, the criminals Luo Hanliang and Yu Tingle were sent to Chigasaki, Saipan and other places in Japan by the "Central Intelligence Agency" in 1952 to receive specialized special agent training in demolition techniques, sending and receiving telegrams, communications, and machinery. In early May 1952, Luo, Yu and eight other criminals, including Liu Qi, who received the same training in Chigasaki, were sent back to Hong Kong from Yokohama, Japan by the US special agent agency using a military submarine. Under the command of Cai Qingwei (alias Song Da), Han Qingzhuo, and Cai Weijun, the chief and deputy commanders of the "Free China Army Guangdong Central District Command," they began a series of sabotage operations against our country. In May of last year, the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agent agency conspired to blow up a bridge on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. They instructed criminals such as Luo and Yu to bribe three gangsters to sneak into Guangzhou to survey the terrain of the bridge, formulate a detailed demolition plan, and obtained the approval of the US special agent. However, this conspiracy failed due to our strict precautions. After that, this group of bandits, under the command of the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agent agency, organized three attempts to sneak into the mainland, all of which failed. However, the bandits were still not discouraged and sneaked into the mainland for the fourth time at 12:00 midnight on January 18 this year. As soon as they landed, they immediately fell into the dragnet of our coastal people. According to the confession of the arrested special agents: The tasks they received from the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agent agency were: After landing, they would flee to Ziluoshan and Wangfushan to establish so-called "guerrilla bases", recruit escaped counter-revolutionaries, develop reactionary bandit armed forces, use kinship, or use money to lure and buy over our agency cadres and local armed personnel to join their special agent organizations, collect our military, political, economic, and cultural intelligence, and blow up our large power plants, bridges, port terminals, and warehouses.

After repeated trials, the Guangdong Provincial People's Court, in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," sentenced the bandits He Kui, Chen Nan, Chen Lie, Zhong Hong, Hu Bimin, Kuang Shiba, Huang Hong, Ma Hua, Luo Hanliang, and Yu Tingle, who resisted arrest by opening fire and whose crimes were serious, to death and executed them immediately. Another criminal, Feng Ri, surrendered to us immediately after sneaking ashore, and led our troops and militia to make meritorious contributions in annihilating the bandits, and was released and assisted in settling down and production.

The Guangdong Provincial People's Government also issued a circular commending the troops, organs, and militia who had made meritorious contributions in suppressing the bandits.

    粉碎美蒋特务破坏活动保障国家建设和人民安全
    广东省人民法院处决偷渡登陆的特务匪徒
   【本报讯】广东沿海地区的人民公安机关和边防部队，于今年一月十九日歼灭了一股从海上偷渡登陆的武装特务，捕获了特务匪徒何葵等十名。经过详细审讯后，广东省人民法院已在最近判处何葵等十名匪徒死刑。
    这股武装特务于一月十八日夜晚在广东沿海的阳江县沙咀乡黄花湾偷渡登陆后，即被我沙咀乡民兵发觉。当地公安机关和边防部队立即采取措施，围捕这一批登陆的特务匪徒。沙咀乡一带的民兵和人民群众也奋起参加围剿。由于匪徒们鸣枪拒捕，我当即与之展开战斗。结果，除一名匪徒自动投诚外，当场击毙匪徒六名，活捉十名，匪徒全部就歼；并缴获冲锋枪十三枝、卡宾枪四枝、手枪十五枝、子弹二千二百五十发、电报密码四本、电台两部、炸药十包、雷管三盒以及“武装斗争计划”和“空降方案”等反革命活动的罪证。
    经过对被捕特务分子的审讯和调查已经确定：这股特务匪徒，大部分是原蒋匪帮的军政官吏、老牌特务、土匪、地主恶霸等坚决的反革命分子。他们在广东解放和一九五一年大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动中，先后畏罪潜逃到香港和澳门，立即被港澳的美国特务首脑机关“中央谍报局”领导下的特务组织“自由中国运动”所收容。其中骆犯汉梁和余犯庭乐，于一九五二年由“中央谍报局”送往日本的茅崎、塞班岛等地受过爆破技术、收发报、通讯、机务等专门的特务训练。一九五二年五月初，骆、余两犯及在茅崎受同样训练的特务刘祺等八人，又被美国特务机关用军用潜艇从日本横滨送返香港，立即在“自由中国陆军粤中区指挥部”正副指挥蔡庆伟（化名宋大）、韩庆擢、蔡维均等指挥下，开始了对我国的一系列破坏行动：去年五月，美蒋特务机关阴谋爆炸广州市广九路某站桥梁，曾指使骆、余等犯收买流氓三人，潜入广州市测绘该站桥梁的地形，拟定了详细的爆破计划，并经美国特务批准。但因我防范严密，这一阴谋未能实现。其后，这批匪徒又在美蒋特务机关的指挥下组织了三次偷渡潜入大陆的行动，均未得逞。但是匪徒们仍不死心，复于今年一月十八日夜十二时第四次偷渡潜入大陆。他们刚一登陆，就立即陷入我沿海人民的天罗地网中。据被捕的特务供称：他们从美蒋特务机关受领的任务是：登陆后就窜往紫罗山、望夫山建立所谓“游击根据地”，网罗漏网的反革命分子，发展反动的土匪武装，利用亲友关系，或以金钱利诱收买我机关干部、地方武装人员参加其特务组织，搜集我军事、政治、经济、文化情报，爆破我大型电力厂、桥梁、港口码头、仓库。
    广东省人民法院经过反复的审讯后，已根据“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”，判处鸣枪拒捕、罪情重大的匪徒何葵、陈南、陈烈、钟洪、胡必敏、邝仕柏、黄洪、马华、骆汉梁、余庭乐以死刑，立即执行；另一罪犯冯日在偷渡登陆后即向我投诚，并引领我部队民兵歼匪立功，予以释放，并资助其安家生产。
    广东省人民政府还发出通令，表扬了剿匪有功的部队、机关和民兵群众。
