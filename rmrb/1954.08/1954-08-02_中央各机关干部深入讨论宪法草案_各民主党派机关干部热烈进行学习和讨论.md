Central government agencies are conducting in-depth study and discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People’s Republic of China. Most agencies have now begun in-depth discussions of Chapter II, "The Structure of the State," of the Draft Constitution. Some agencies are nearing the end of the discussion phase and are currently conducting general reviews.

The activities of studying and discussing the Draft Constitution in all agencies are conducted under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party committees in the agencies. The directly affiliated units of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the leading organs of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the leading organs of various people's organizations began studying and discussing the Draft Constitution after its promulgation. The study and discussion activities of the directly affiliated agencies of the Central People's Government generally began successively in early July. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and other units have established special committees for discussing the Draft Constitution. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions also publishes a "Brief Report on the Discussion of the Draft Constitution" every week. Each directly affiliated unit has formed a core group and established a study secretary to assist the work of the Draft Constitution discussion committee. The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government and many other agencies also used broadcasts, blackboards, and wall newspapers to publicize the content of the Draft Constitution to agency personnel. Before the formal start of study and discussion, the main responsible comrades of each agency made mobilization reports to all staff members regarding the study and discussion of the Draft Constitution. To help everyone study and discuss, the Work Committee of the directly affiliated organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Work Committee of the directly affiliated organs of the Central People's Government of the Communist Party of China, and some other agencies have held report meetings on the Draft Constitution. Leaders of some agencies have also provided in-depth guidance to cadres' discussions.

The staff of all agencies are serious and active in studying and discussing the Draft Constitution. The Legislative Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Justice of the Central People's Government, the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, and other agencies have insisted on two half-days of collective study and discussion every week. Staff of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government and some other agencies, in addition to the unified scheduled time for collective study and discussion, also take time in the morning or evening to read relevant reference books on the constitution to help in the study of the Draft Constitution. In the chapter-by-chapter and article-by-article discussions, speakers are generally very enthusiastic, and some also express their opinions in light of China's actual situation and their personal life experiences, explaining the spirit and content of the Draft Constitution. Many agency personnel have already put forward many suggestions for revising the Draft Constitution during the discussions. According to incomplete statistics from some units of the Work Committee of the directly affiliated organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China as of July 27, a total of 789 revisions and questions have been raised. As of July 27, the directly affiliated units of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions had raised a total of 758 revisions and questions. From the revisions proposed by various agencies, most are related to wording, and some are related to content. For example, some suggested that the national anthem should be stipulated in the constitution; some suggested that a sentence could be added to the "Preamble": "Taiwan is our country's territory, and we must liberate Taiwan."

Through preliminary study and discussion, the staff of the central government agencies have a general understanding of the basic spirit of the Draft Constitution. The discussion at this stage has initially clarified the confused or incorrect ideas of some people, made them realize the great significance of the state formulating a constitution at present, understood the principle that as a state agency staff member, one should model, resolutely abide by, and implement the constitution, and also realized that the formally promulgated constitution will surely promote the enthusiasm and initiative of state agency staff in their work. Many staff members expressed that they will continue to study the Draft Constitution in depth, thoroughly understand the content of the Draft Constitution, and actively put forward opinions, and together with the people of the whole country, complete the glorious task of formulating a constitution.

Cadres of the central agencies of the democratic parties and the Beijing municipal agencies are conducting in-depth study and discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and its Beijing Municipal Branch jointly established an office for the discussion of the Draft Constitution before the start of study and discussion. People who spoke in the discussions were very enthusiastic, and everyone unanimously expressed support for the Draft Constitution. Through this stage of study and discussion, some people have become more aware of the greatness of the Chinese Communist Party and the loveliness of the motherland, and they pledged to welcome the birth of the first constitution of the Chinese people with strengthened socialist ideological remolding and practical actions in doing their work well. Currently, after understanding the basic spirit of the Draft Constitution, everyone has begun a chapter-by-chapter and article-by-article discussion.

After formally concluding the study of the general tasks of the state during the transition period in mid-July, the cadres of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League turned to the study and discussion of the Draft Constitution. Everyone can generally read the Draft Constitution and related reference documents carefully, and the discussions are relatively in-depth and detailed.

The full-time cadres of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy and the full-time cadres and non-working members of its Beijing Municipal Branch are very enthusiastic in studying and discussing the Draft Constitution. They believe that studying the Draft Constitution is not only a political study for cadres of the democratic parties but also a professional study; they should not only strive to study well themselves but also actively conduct in-depth publicity to the masses they contact. Now, the preamble and general program have been discussed, and the discussion of the second chapter, the national structure, has begun.

According to the plan of the Democratic Parties Branch of the Beijing Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee, the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and its Beijing Municipal Committee requested all cadres to conscientiously study and discuss the Draft Constitution on the basis of studying the thought of the general tasks of the state during the transition period, put forward amendments and supplementary opinions, and understand the great significance of the state formulating a constitution, understand the basic spirit and main content of the Draft Constitution, and further improve their political enthusiasm. On July 1, after all cadres listened to the report on the Draft Constitution by Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, they read relevant documents, and on July 13, they began group discussions. Three propagandists who had participated in the study of the Democratic Parties Branch of the Beijing Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee participated in the discussion groups to carry out propaganda and explanation to help everyone study. Now, they have entered the stage of discussing the general program article by article and sentence by sentence and have put forward twelve amendments.

The working cadres of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party began to read the Draft Constitution and related reference documents on July 1, and the discussion began on July 20, dividing the discussion into three stages. The first stage mainly discusses the basic spirit of the Draft Constitution, the second stage conducts chapter-by-chapter and article-by-article discussions, and the third stage conducts comprehensive discussions. Currently, the first stage of studying and discussing the basic spirit of the Draft Constitution is underway. While studying and discussing, they also conduct explanations on the content of the Draft Constitution to returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese they contact.

The study and discussion of the Draft Constitution by the cadres and workers of the General Office of the Jiusan Society and its Beijing Municipal Branch officially began on July 12. Everyone attaches great importance to this study. Generally, they carefully read the Draft Constitution and reference documents. As of now, the cadre group has conducted four discussions. The revisions and questions raised in the study and discussion have been promptly submitted to the Democratic Parties Branch of the Beijing Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee.

    中央各机关干部深入讨论宪法草案
    各民主党派机关干部热烈进行学习和讨论
    中央各机关的工作人员正在深入地学习和讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案。现在大多数机关已开始深入讨论宪法草案第二章“国家机构”部分。有的机关的讨论已接近结束阶段，目前正在进行总复习。
    各机关学习和讨论宪法草案的活动都是在机关中的中共党委领导下进行的。中国共产党中央直属各单位、中国新民主主义青年团中央领导机关和各人民团体的领导机关，在宪法草案公布后就开始学习和讨论。中央人民政府直属各机关的学习和讨论活动一般都在七月上旬先后开始。中央人民政府外交部、中华全国总工会等单位专门成立了宪法草案讨论委员会。中华全国总工会每周并刊印“讨论宪法草案情况简报”，各直属单位并组成了核心小组，设立了学习秘书，协助宪法草案讨论委员会的工作。中央人民政府铁道部和其他很多机关还通过广播、黑板报、墙报等形式向机关人员宣传宪法草案的内容。在学习和讨论正式开始前，各机关的主要负责同志曾向全体工作人员作了关于学习和讨论宪法草案的动员报告。为了帮助大家学习和讨论，中国共产党中央直属机关委员会、中国共产党中央人民政府直属机关委员会和其他有些机关都曾举办了宪法草案报告会。有些机关的领导人员还对干部的讨论深入进行辅导。
    各机关工作人员对宪法草案的学习和讨论都是认真和积极的。中央人民政府法制委员会、中央人民政府司法部、中央人民政府最高人民法院等机关，每个星期都能坚持两个半天的集体学习和讨论。中央人民政府内务部和有些机关的工作人员，除在统一规定的时间集体学习和讨论外，自己还抽出早晨或晚上的时间阅读有关宪法的参考书籍，以帮助对宪法草案的研究。各机关在逐章逐条的讨论中，发言的人一般都很热烈，有的人还联系我国实际情况和个人的生活经历发表意见，说明宪法草案的精神和内容。不少机关工作人员在讨论中已提出了许多对宪法草案的修改意见。据中国共产党中央直属机关委员会部分单位截至七月二十七日的不完全统计，提出的修改意见和问题共有七百八十九条。中华全国总工会直属各单位到七月二十七日止，提出的修改意见和问题共有七百五十八条。从各机关所提出的修改意见来看，主要是对文字方面的，也有一些意见是有关内容方面的，如有人建议在宪法内规定国歌等；有的人提出在“序言”中可以加一句：“台湾是我国的领土，我们要解放台湾。”
    经过初步的学习和讨论，中央各机关的工作人员对宪法草案的基本精神已有了一个概括的认识。这一阶段的讨论初步澄清了一些人的糊涂的或不正确的思想，使他们认识到国家在目前制定宪法的重大意义，懂得了作为一个国家机关工作人员应该模范地坚决地遵守宪法、执行宪法的道理，并且也认识到将来正式颁布的宪法必将推动国家机关工作人员发挥工作中的积极性和主动性的巨大作用。很多工作人员表示：要继续深入地讨论宪法草案，透彻地了解宪法草案的内容，并积极提出意见，和全国人民一起完成制定宪法的光荣任务。（新华社）
    各民主党派中央机关和北京市机关的干部，正在深入地学习和讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    中国国民党革命委员会中央机关和所属北京市分部，在学习和讨论开始前，联合成立了宪法草案讨论办公室。在讨论中发言的人非常热烈，大家一致表示拥护宪法草案。有些人通过这一阶段的学习和讨论，更加体会到中国共产党的伟大和祖国的可爱，保证要以加强社会主义的思想改造和做好工作的实际行动来迎接中国人民第一个宪法的诞生。目前，大家在了解了宪法草案的基本精神后，已开始了逐章逐条的讨论。
    中国民主同盟中央机关的干部，在七月中旬正式结束了国家在过渡时期的总任务的学习以后，即转入宪法草案的学习和讨论。大家一般都能认真阅读宪法草案和有关参考文件，在讨论中也比较深入、细致。
    中国民主促进会中央机关专职干部和所属北京市分会专职干部及不在职成员，在学习和讨论宪法草案中，情绪非常高涨，都认为学习宪法草案不仅是民主党派干部的政治学习，也是业务学习；不但要争取自己学好，而且应积极向所联系的群众进行深入的宣传。现在已讨论完序言、总纲部分，进入了第二章国家机构部分的讨论。
    中国农工民主党中央机关和所属北京市委员会根据北京市宪法草案讨论委员会民主党派分会的计划，要求全体干部在学习国家在过渡时期的总任务的思想基础上，认真学习和讨论宪法草案，提出修改和补充意见，并认识国家制定宪法的重大意义，理解宪法草案的基本精神和主要内容，进一步提高政治积极性。七月一日，全体干部听过北京市人民政府副市长张友渔关于宪法草案的报告后，即进行阅读有关文件，七月十三日开始展开分组讨论。曾经参加北京市宪法草案讨论委员会民主党派分会学习过的三位宣传员，分别参加各讨论小组，进行宣传讲解，帮助大家学习，现在已进入对总纲部分逐条逐句的讨论阶段，并已提出了十二条修改意见。
    中国致公党中央机关的工作干部，七月一日开始阅读宪法草案和有关参考文件，七月二十日开始了讨论，并把讨论分为三个阶段进行。第一阶段主要是讨论宪法草案的基本精神，第二阶段进行逐章逐条讨论，第三阶段综合讨论。现在正在进行第一阶段关于宪法草案的基本精神的学习和讨论。在学习和讨论的同时，并对联系的归国华侨和华侨眷属进行关于宪法草案内容的说明工作。
    九三学社总社和所属北京市分社的机关干部和工人对宪法草案的学习和讨论，在七月十二日正式开始。大家都很重视这一学习。一般都仔细地阅读了宪法草案和参考文件。截至目前止，干部组已进行了四次讨论。在学习和讨论中提出的修改意见和问题，已及时交到北京市宪法草案讨论委员会民主党派分会。（新华社）
