Summer harvesting in the river valley areas of Qinghai Province has been universally launched. In some of the warmer areas such as Minhe County, the summer harvest has basically concluded, and efforts are now being focused on threshing the new grain. Judging from the current crop growth and the results of the harvest, increased production can basically be achieved throughout the province. Huangyuan County estimates that it can increase grain production by more than 12% compared to 1952. Minhe, Ledu, Xunhua, Huangzhong, and Huzhu counties are all expected to increase production compared to last year, with some even exceeding the levels of the year before last. Shi Chunkui, the model farmer of spring wheat high yield in 1952, estimates that his winter wheat will yield an average of 700 jin per mu, and his Biyu wheat will yield 650 jin. Although the farming techniques of the Zhou Wenwei mutual aid team are not as good as those of the Shi Chunkui mutual aid team, their Biyu wheat also yields an average of around 600 jin per mu. In some of the river valley areas of Huangzhong, the harvest of highland barley and barley has been completed, and more than half of the wheat has been harvested. According to actual measurements by farmers, the yield of highland barley is generally more than 500 jin per mu, and wheat is more than 400 jin.

    青海省川水地区
    夏季作物普遍增产
    青海省川水地区夏收工作，已经普遍展开，民和等县个别较暖地区夏收已基本结束，现正积极打碾新粮。从目前庄稼生长情况及收割的结果看，在全省范围内基本上可获得增产。湟源县估计可比一九五二年增产粮食百分之十二以上，民和、乐都、循化、湟中、互助等县预计都比去年增产，有些还超过前年。一九五二年春小麦丰产模范史春奎的庄稼，预计冬麦每亩平均产量七百斤，碧玉麦六百五十斤，当地周文维互助组的耕作技术虽不及史春奎互助组，但碧玉麦每亩平均产量也有六百斤左右。湟中部分川水地青稞、大麦已收割完毕，小麦已收一半以上，根据农民实测，青稞每亩产量一般都在五百斤以上，小麦在四百斤以上。
