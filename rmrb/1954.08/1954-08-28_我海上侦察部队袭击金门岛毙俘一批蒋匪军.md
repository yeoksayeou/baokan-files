Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: On the Fujian front, the naval reconnaissance unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army killed and wounded more than ten remnant Chiang bandit troops stationed on Jinmen Island and captured one bandit soldier alive in an attack.

On the evening of August 23rd, the naval reconnaissance detachment on the Fujian front crossed the strait in two routes and landed on the beach of Guningtou on Jinmen Island to attack the Chiang bandit troops. One route discovered a Chiang bandit soldier bathing by the river. When the soldiers went to capture him, the enemy ran away and was immediately shot dead by us. At the same time, another route, led by a commander, cleverly passed through the Chiang bandit army's cordon line and touched the shed where the Chiang bandit troops lived near the coast. There were about two squads of Chiang bandit troops sleeping there. Our commander ordered an attack on the enemy, and one Chiang bandit soldier was captured alive on the spot, and more than ten Chiang bandit troops were killed and wounded. After completing the mission, our reconnaissance detachment returned victoriously without any losses. According to the confession of a captured Chiang bandit corporal, these annihilated bandits belonged to the 3rd platoon of the 6th company of the 2nd battalion of the 204th regiment of the 68th division of the Chiang bandit 6th army stationed on Jinmen Island.
