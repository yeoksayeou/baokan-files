On a stifling summer evening, I finished watching "No, We Want to Live!", the first Japanese film shown in China after the war. When the ruins of Ueno appeared on the screen, when I saw thousands of unemployed men and women crowding and struggling in front of the temporary labor employment agency, and when I saw the protagonist, Mori, separated from his wife and children, there were constant exclamations and sighs from the audience. But when the story developed to the point where Mori decided to commit suicide with his family, fed his two children with "money stolen by petty theft," and took them to the amusement park to let them "enjoy the joy of the world for the last time," the screening room was silent. The two children laughed heartily on the model airplane, but many of the people watching the preview shed tears.

On the way home after watching the preview, I suddenly thought of a work by Fujimori Seikichi twenty years ago, "Who Made Her Like This?". Who made her like this? Who made them like this? The screenwriter did not answer this question from the mouth of any character in the play. But I think that the playwright and the artists who participated in this film have already told the audience through the real depiction of the characters' personalities and the logic of life, so there is no need to explain or point it out.

The protagonist of the film, Mori, is a bankrupt small business owner. In capitalist societies and colonial and semi-colonial countries, this kind of person has their common fate, as well as their common weaknesses and sorrows. Having gone bankrupt, lost their jobs, and struggling on the line of death, they are already so humble, so cowardly, and have reached the point where they will do anything as long as they can "live on." However, when he has drunk three glasses of wine and temporarily forgets the "present," he will stubbornly recall the "past" when he was a shopkeeper, and feel that this was the "best days" of his life. On the one hand, the screenwriter nakedly exposed the weaknesses in the character of this kind of person, making his ridiculous nostalgia for the past form a realistic satire in front of the audience. But on the other hand, the playwright also used the convincing logic of real life, step by step, to force Mori to open his eyes and realize that only among the people who have been treated the same way as him—or even suffered more than him—can he get sympathy and support. Begging the landlord, Yamakawa, and pleading with the small factory owner, Yoshida, will not yield any results. However, when he tells his difficulties in the "War Victims' Compound" to Mizuno, whom the author does not identify but the audience can intuitively recognize as a progressive element, a mass "rescue movement" immediately begins in front of the compound. The scene where old woman Akiyama bangs on a tin bucket, shouting "Two hundred and forty [Note 1], come out quickly," and then a donation of three or five yuan is collected from this group of sufferers is touching and unforgettable. This is a scene of carp in a dry rut moistening each other, and this is also an important hint the author gives to the audience. The source of Mori's desire to live and ability to live is in this. It is a pity that the cruel environment prevented the author from further depicting this power, so that he could not show the unity and struggle of this group of sufferers at the end of the film.

The screenwriter depicted Mori's family, the war victims in the compound, and also the characters in the small inn that reminded us of Gorky's "The Lower Depths." There are alcoholics, gamblers, petty thieves, and various deformed characters who are overwhelmed by the cruel reality; there is exclusion, precaution, and also warmth; but in general, including Mori, Akiyama, and Hanamura, the social consciousness of this group of people is still at a lower level. They are all humble people who have been shackled by the occupying system of American imperialism and live miserable lives under the iron hooves of foreign races. No one can tell the reason for their suffering, and they do not seem to have found a way to escape this suffering. However, one point is expressed very strongly in the film, that is, they do not want to die, they "want to live." This is human instinct, this is the starting point from spontaneity to consciousness, from survival to struggle. To live, they have to think; to live, they have to explore; when they think wrong and go wrong, they have to turn back. The film ends with Mori turning back. Suicide of the whole family is not the solution. "We want to live." How can we live? The "Film Ethics Regulations Committee" [Note 2] does not allow the playwright to give a clear answer. Then, can the audience find the answer? I think they can. At the end of the film, when Mori walks ashore with his son Yuichi in his arms, his eyebrows are clear, he no longer has melancholy, and he should no longer have illusions. The desire for survival encourages him, real life educates him, and the development trend of the Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, and democracy induces him. Therefore, although the screenwriter cannot allow Mori and his group to step onto the forefront of the struggle as desired, Mori's conclusion, conveyed with a cheerful expression, is still powerful and credible. I remembered a saying of Stalin: "These countries [Note 3] were yesterday powerful imperialist countries that shook the foundations of British, American, and French rule in Europe and Asia. To think that these countries will not try to stand up again, break the American 'system,' and embark on the road of independent development—this is tantamount to believing in gods and monsters." Mori and his group must live on and can live on, and the Japanese people must embark on the road of independent development. This is the law of revolutionary development, and the shackles of American imperialism can never bind the Japanese people who want to live.

To live, we must unite and struggle. Look, the face of the Japanese people, represented by Mori, has already shown the power of strong life.

[Note 1] Refers to those who do odd jobs, because their daily wage is only 240 yen, so they got such a nickname.
[Note 2] Is an agency that reviews films.
[Note 3] Refers to Germany and Japan. (Attached picture)

Mori and the unemployed crowd squeezed in front of the temporary labor employment agency waiting to receive work tickets.

After Mori rescued his son Yuichi, he decided to live on!

    “不，我们要活下去！”观感
    夏衍
    编剧：岩佐氏寿　平田兼三　今井正　导演：今井正

    日本新星电影公司  前进座剧团共同摄制　东北电影制片厂译制
    在一个郁闷的盛夏晚上，看完了战后第一部在中国放映的日本影片“不，我们要活下去！”。从银幕上看到上野废墟的时候，看到千万失业男女在临时劳工就业介绍所前面拥挤挣扎的时候，看到影片的主人公毛利和他妻儿分别的时候，座中不断地发出了惊讶和叹息的声音。可是当故事发展到毛利决心全家自杀，拿“作小偷弄来的钱”喂饱了两个孩子，把他们带到游乐场所，让他们“最后享受一下人间的欢乐”的时候，放映间寂然无声了。两个孩子在模型飞机上纵声欢笑，不少看试片的人却潸然下泪了。
    看完试片的归途，我陡然想起了二十年前藤森成吉写的一部作品“谁使她如此”。谁使她如此？谁使他们如此？电影剧本的作者并没有从任何一个剧中人的口里回答这一个问题。但是我想，剧作者和参加这部影片的艺术家们已经通过人物性格的真实描写，用生活的逻辑来告诉了观众，所以，再没有说明和点破之必要了。
    影片的主人公毛利是一个破产了的小企业主，在资本主义社会、殖民地半殖民地国家，这一类人有他们共同的运命，也有他们共同的弱点和悲哀。破了产，失了业，挣扎在死亡线上，已经是那样的卑微，那样的懦怯，已经到了只要能够“活下去”什么都要干的地步，可是，当他三杯酒下肚，暂时忘记了“现在”的时候，他还会执拗地想起当过掌柜的“过去”，而觉得这就是他这一生中的“最好的日子”。电影剧本作者一方面赤裸裸地揭露了这一类人的性格上的弱点，使他的这种可笑的对过去的怀恋在观众前面形成了现实的讽嘲，可是在另一面，剧作者也用使人信服的现实生活的逻辑，一步一步的迫使毛利睁开眼睛，认识到只有在和他同样地受到作践——乃至受到比他更苦痛的遭际的人群中间，才能得到同情和支援。对房东山川的央告，对小厂主吉田的哀求，是得不到任何结果的，可是，当他在“战争受难者大杂院”里把困难告诉了作者并没有说明身份而观众直觉地可以认识这是一个进步分子的水野的时候，大杂院前面的群众性的“援救运动”立刻开始了。秋山老太婆敲着洋铁桶，喊着“二百四们〔注一〕，快出来”，接着，从这群受难者中间三元五元地凑成一笔捐款的那一场戏，是感人而难于忘却的。这是涸辙之鲋，相濡相煦的情景，这也就是作者给观众的一个重要的暗示。毛利的要活下去和能够活下去，其力量的源泉就在于此。遗憾的是残酷的环境阻止了作者对于这种力量的进一步的描写，使他不能在这部影片的结尾，表现出这一群受难者们的团结和斗争。
    电影剧本作者描写了毛利的一家，描写了大杂院里的战争受难者，也描写了使我们联想起高尔基笔下的“夜店”的小客栈里的人物。这里有酒鬼，有赌徒，有小偷，有被残酷的现实压得透不过气来的各种畸形人物；这中间有排挤，有戒备，也有温情；但是一般说来，包括毛利、秋山、花村在内，这群人的社会意识还处于一个较低的水平。他们都是被美国帝国主义的占领制度加上了镣铐，在异族铁蹄下过着可怜生活的卑微人物，没有一个人能说出使他们受罪的原因，他们也好像还没有找到挣脱这种苦难的道路，可是，有一点在影片里是表现得非常强烈的，这就是他们不愿意死，他们“要活”。这是人的本能，这是从自发到自觉、从求生到斗争的起点。要活下去，他们就得思想，要活下去，他们就得探索，想错和走错了的时候，他们就得回头。影片，是用毛利的回头来结束的，全家自杀不是办法，“我们要活下去”，怎样才能活呢？“映画伦理规程委员会”〔注二〕不让剧作者作出明白的答案。那么，观众是不是能找到答案呢？我想是能够的。在影片结尾，当毛利抱着他的儿子雄一走上岸来的时候，他的眉宇是开朗的，他已经再没有忧郁，也应该再没有幻想了，求生的欲望鼓舞着他，现实的生活教育了他，日本人民争取和平、独立、民主斗争的发展趋势诱掖着他，因此，尽管电影剧本作者不能如愿地让毛利和他的一群走上斗争的前列，可是，毛利用开朗的表情来传达了的这个结论，依然是有力而可信的。我想起了斯大林的一句话：“这些国家〔注三〕昨天还是震撼了英国、美国、法国在欧洲和亚洲统治基础的强大帝国主义国家。如果认为这些国家不会设法重新站起来，打破美国的‘制度’，奔上独立发展的道路，——这就等于相信神怪。”毛利和他的一群一定要活下去、能活下去，日本人民一定要奔上独立发展的道路，这是革命发展的规律，美帝国主义的镣铐，是永远束缚不了要活下去的日本人民的。
    要活下去，就得团结和斗争，看吧，以毛利为代表的日本人民的脸上，已经显示出坚强的生命的力量了。
     〔注一〕是指那些打零工的人们，因为他们每天的工资只有二百四十日元，所以得到这么一个绰号。
    〔注二〕是一个审查影片的机构。
    〔注三〕指德国和日本。  （附图片）
