The Face of a Robber
Hu Shisheng

On July 23rd, an accidental incident occurred in the airspace over Yulin Port, Hainan Island, China, where a British transport plane was shot down. This accidental event was already being resolved by the Chinese and British governments through proper diplomatic channels. However, the American warmongering clique, which thrives on chaos, immediately seized this opportunity. US Secretary of Defense Wilson even ordered the dispatch of a mixed fleet, including two aircraft carriers and eight destroyers, to the waters near the eastern part of Hainan Island, China, under the pretext of "rescuing" the British plane, thus provoking China. American planes taking off from American warships intruded into China's airspace and attacked and shot down two Chinese patrol planes. The American news agency reported that US Pacific Fleet Commander Stump admitted that the activities of the aircraft carrier sent to the South China Sea were "directly under the command of Chief of Naval Operations Carney" and that the personnel on the ships and aircraft were "under existing orders" to "open fire immediately." It is clear to everyone that this is a completely outrageous and barbaric act of aggression by the United States against China.

However, Dulles, a master of distorting right and wrong, described the US's act of sending a large number of warships and planes to provoke China as a "humanitarian rescue effort," while the fact that Chinese planes patrolling over Chinese territory were suddenly attacked and shot down by American fighter planes became "communist atrocities." Dulles even groundlessly lodged a so-called "protest" against China. Obviously, Dulles's "logic" of trying to escape culpability is completely untenable. Look, the United States sent a huge naval fleet thousands of kilometers away to the Chinese seas to cause trouble. What kind of "humanity" is this!

Currently, some American warmongers are still planning to escalate the incident. United Press International reported on July 28th that American officials said the United States would keep its aircraft carriers and planes in the South China Sea "for as long as necessary." This immediately exposes the "humanitarian" lie fabricated by Dulles. It turns out that the real purpose of the American fleet coming to the vicinity of Hainan Island is not to carry out any "humanitarian" or "benevolent" "rescue" missions, but to carry out aggression in the area. The clamor of American warmongers has aroused dissatisfaction and condemnation from world opinion. Only in order to ease world opinion did Eisenhower change his tune at a press conference on July 28th, saying that he "anticipated" that the period of the American fleet searching for "survivors" in the South China Sea was over and that the two American aircraft carriers would "soon leave the area."

People want to ask: Why are the American warmongering cliques so anxious, even resorting to the most despicable means, to provoke a new tense situation in the Far East?

As everyone knows, the ceasefire in Indochina has not only further eased international tensions, but also helped establish Asian peace and collective security, which has greatly undermined the US plan to put together military blocs in Asia. US government leaders and reactionary public opinion have recently made no secret of their great annoyance and resentment towards the Geneva Conference agreements. Even Stump, the US Pacific Fleet commander who directly directed this provocation, while frantically clamoring to "open fire immediately," also admitted that he "felt unhappy" about the fact that the Indochina ceasefire meant that more territory and more people gained freedom and peace. Therefore, these warmongers who "feel unhappy" about peace, like drowning people grabbing at straws, seized the British plane incident as an excuse to run wild.

The result? Not only, as United Press International admitted, does this provocative action "not win any new friends for the United States in Asia," but it can only further expose the face of American warmongers who are extremely afraid of peace, making them even more isolated in Asia.

    强盗的嘴脸
    胡思升
    七月二十三日，在我国海南岛榆林港上空发生了一架英国运输机被击落的意外事件。这个偶然事件本来已经由中英两国政府按照正当的外交途径加以解决了，可是，唯恐天下不乱的美国好战集团却马上抓住这个机会，美国国防部长威尔逊竟下令派遣包括两艘航空母舰和八艘驱逐舰的混合编队，进入我国海南岛东部附近海面，借口“援救”英国失事飞机而向我国挑衅。从美国军舰上起飞的美国飞机并侵入我国领空，袭击并击落了我国巡逻飞机两架。美国通讯社报道，美国太平洋舰队司令斯图普承认，派往南中国海的航空母舰的活动是“直接听命于海军作战部长卡涅的”，舰只和飞机上的人员“奉到现行命令”，要他们“立刻开火”。任何人都看得清楚，这完全是美国对我国的放肆的野蛮的侵略行为。
    但是，颠倒是非的能手杜勒斯却把美国出动大批军舰和飞机向我国挑衅的暴行说成是“人道的援救工作”，而在我国领土上空巡逻的我国飞机遭到美国战斗机突然袭击并被击落却成了“共产党的残暴行为”。杜勒斯还凭空向我国提出什么“抗议”。很显然，杜勒斯这种企图逃脱罪责的“逻辑”是完全站不住脚的。大家看看，美国派遣庞大的海军编队跑到几千公里以外的中国海面上来惹事生非，这是一种什么样的“人道”！
    目前，美国的一些好战分子仍然打算扩大事端。合众社记者七月二十八日报道，美国官员们说，美国将把它的航空母舰和飞机保持在南中国海，“需要多长时间就多长时间”。这就一下子揭穿了杜勒斯编造的“人道”的谎言，原来美国舰队开到海南岛附近来的真正目的并不是执行什么“人道”、“仁慈”的“援救”的任务，而是要到这个地区来进行侵略活动。美国好战分子的叫嚣，已经引起了世界舆论的不满和斥责。只是为了缓和世界舆论，艾森豪威尔在七月二十八日的记者招待会上才改口说，他“预料”美国舰队在南中国海面上寻找“幸存者”的时期已经结束，美国的两艘航空母舰“不久将离开该地区”。
    人们要问：美国好战集团为什么要如此情急地，甚至不惜采取最卑鄙的手法来挑起远东新的紧张形势呢？
    大家知道，印度支那的停战不仅进一步缓和了国际紧张局势，而且有助于亚洲和平和集体安全的建立，这就大大打击了美国在亚洲拼凑军事集团的计划。美国政府首脑和反动舆论近来就毫不掩饰地对日内瓦会议协议表示很大的恼怒和愤恨。就是这个直接指挥这次挑衅事件的美国太平洋舰队司令斯图普，在疯狂地叫嚷“立刻开火”的同时，也承认对印度支那停火意味着更多的领土和更多的人获得自由与和平的情况“感到不愉快”。于是，这些对和平“感到不愉快”的好战分子像落水的人抓住稻草一样，就抓住英机事件作为借口乱干一通了。
    结果呢？不但像合众社电讯承认的，这种挑衅行动“使美国在亚洲不会赢得任何新的朋友”，而且只能进一步暴露美国好战分子极端害怕和平的嘴脸，使他们自己在亚洲更加孤立。
