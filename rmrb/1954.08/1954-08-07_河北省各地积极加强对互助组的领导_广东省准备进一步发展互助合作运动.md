Hebei Province Actively Strengthens Leadership Over Mutual Aid Teams; Guangdong Province Prepares to Further Develop the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement

Hebei is actively strengthening leadership over mutual aid teams in various regions to create conditions for the large-scale establishment of agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest.

Currently, households participating in mutual aid teams across the province account for approximately 60% of the total number of households. Many mutual aid teams have established relatively reasonable systems for recording work points and clearing labor, and some teams have accumulated public property. For example, 41 mutual aid teams in Hebei Township, Daxing County, jointly purchased new-style farm tools; 19 mutual aid teams in Xiadian Township in Sanhe County, Houshayu Township in Shunyi County, and others collectively dug seven new brick wells and jointly purchased seven waterwheels, preparing conditions for the transition to cooperatives. Many mutual aid teams are now making various preparations for the transition to cooperatives after the autumn harvest. In Tangshan Prefecture alone, more than 30,000 mutual aid teams have already completed ideological groundwork for the transition to cooperatives.

Based on these circumstances, various regions have further strengthened leadership over mutual aid teams. Many counties convened representative conferences of mutual aid and cooperation, conveying plans for actively developing agricultural production cooperatives this winter and next spring, and proposing specific measures for consolidating and improving mutual aid teams. After the conclusion of the mutual aid and cooperation representative conferences in various counties of Handan Prefecture, they conducted a categorized assessment of mutual aid teams in conjunction with the current patriotic agricultural production increase campaign, selected targets for transitioning to cooperatives, and mobilized township and village Party branches and agricultural production cooperatives to assign personnel to provide support and guidance. For example, according to statistics from eight townships in the Third District of Linzhang County, they are focusing on cultivating 199 mutual aid teams preparing to transition to cooperatives. The methods used by various regions to cultivate mutual aid teams mainly involve earnestly implementing the policy of voluntary participation and mutual benefit through current production, doing a good job of evaluating and recording work points, and carrying out work point evaluation and price determination. In each stage of production, they help each team to formulate production plans and resolve contradictions in the timing of work within mutual aid teams, so that the mutual aid teams can be further consolidated and improved through production.

The mutual aid and cooperation movement in various regions of Guangdong made significant progress between the spring and summer of this year. Currently, 1,003 agricultural production cooperatives have been established throughout the province. The number of organized farming households in the province accounts for approximately 46% of the total number of farming households, a fourfold increase compared to last winter. Due to the development of mutual aid and cooperation, the early rice harvest this year was generally abundant. In particular, the first batch of 258 agricultural production cooperatives established this spring generally increased production by 20% to 30% or more compared to the same period last year, which influenced the surrounding masses to more eagerly demand participation in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In order to welcome the large-scale development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement after the autumn harvest this year, in addition to paying attention to consolidating and improving existing cooperatives, various regions will also conduct large-scale cadre training and summarize the experience of establishing cooperatives. The CPC Yuezhong District Committee has organized four working groups to go to Zhongshan, Nanhai, Dongguan, and Shunde counties to carry out work. Around mid-June, various regions generally trained the backbone of mutual aid teams. According to statistics from 39 counties in the three districts of Yuedong, Yuezhong, and Yuexi, a total of more than 26,000 mutual aid team backbone members were trained, improving the leadership level of mutual aid teams. During the summer harvest and summer planting, many mutual aid teams have been further consolidated, improved, and developed. According to statistics from 40 districts in five counties in the Yuedong District, more than 1,800 temporary mutual aid teams have been transformed into permanent mutual aid teams after the conclusion of the mutual aid team backbone training courses. Puning County in the district has also newly developed more than 890 mutual aid teams; Heyuan County has also established 24 joint mutual aid teams. (Wu Erxiang)

    河北省各地积极加强对互助组的领导
    广东省准备进一步发展互助合作运动
    河北各地积极加强对互助组的领导，给秋后大批建立农业生产合作社创造条件。
    现在全省参加互助组的农户已占总农户百分之六十左右。不少互助组建立了较合理的记工、清工等制度，部分组还积累了公共财产。如大兴县河北乡有四十一个互助组伙买了新式农具；三河县夏垫乡、顺义县后沙峪等乡，有十九个互助组，集体打砖井七眼，伙买水车七辆，为转社准备了条件。现在不少互助组正为秋后转社进行各种准备。仅唐山专区就有三万多个互助组已做好转社的思想酝酿。
    各地根据这些情况，进一步加强了对互助组的领导。不少县召开了互助合作代表会议，传达了今冬明春积极发展农业生产合作社的计划，提出了巩固与提高互助组的具体办法。邯郸专区各县互助合作代表会议结束以后，结合当前的农业爱国增产竞赛运动，对互助组进行了分类排队，选择出转社目标，发动乡、村党的支部、农业生产合作社分工包干培养。如临漳县三区据八个乡的统计，重点培养着一百九十九个准备转社的互助组。各地培养互助组的方法，主要是通过当前生产，认真贯彻自愿互利政策，做好评工记工，进行齐工找价；在每段生产中，帮助各组做好生产计划，解决互助组做活中的先后矛盾，从生产中使互助组得到进一步巩固和提高。
    广东各地互助合作运动，在今年春夏间又有了很大的发展，现在全省已建成一千零三个农业生产合作社。全省组织起来的农户，已约占总农户百分之四十六，比去冬增加了四倍。由于互助合作的发展，今年早稻普遍获得丰收，特别是今年春建立的第一批二百五十八个农业生产合作社，普遍比去年同期增产百分之二十到三十以上，因而影响了周围的群众更热切地要求参加互助合作组织。为了迎接今年秋后互助合作运动的大发展，各地除了注意巩固提高现有社外，并将大规模的轮训干部，总结建社经验。中共粤中区委员会已组织了四个工作组分赴中山、南海、东莞、顺德等县进行工作。各地在六月中旬前后，对互助组骨干普遍进行了训练，据粤东、粤中、粤西三个区三十九个县统计，共训练了互助组骨干二万六千多人，提高了互助组的领导水平。在夏收夏种中，许多互助组都获得了进一步的巩固提高和发展，据粤东区五个县的四十个区的统计，在互助组骨干训练班结束后，已有一千八百多个临时互助组转为常年互助组。该区的普宁县并新发展了八百九十多个互助组；河源县还建立了二十四个互助组联组。　（吴尔祥）
