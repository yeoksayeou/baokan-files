Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: The United States is intensifying preparations for a meeting to assemble a Southeast Asian aggression bloc, scheduled to open on September 6th in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Representatives from the United States and the other seven countries that have announced their participation in this meeting are busy in Washington discussing a draft of the Southeast Asia group's regulations. The United States has submitted its draft regulations to the governments of these seven countries.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles announced at a press conference in Washington on the 24th that he plans to depart for the Philippines on August 31st. Around September 4th, he will begin discussions with Philippine officials on the further implementation of the "U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty," and then participate in the meeting to discuss the establishment of the Southeast Asia group, which begins on the 6th. Dulles indicated that the United States wants to stipulate the military obligations that the countries participating in the Southeast Asia group should undertake based on the bilateral treaties it has separately concluded with the Philippines and the Syngman Rhee group, as well as the treaty it has concluded with Australia and New Zealand.

As early as mid-August, when the meeting to organize the Southeast Asia group was announced, the United States indicated that it primarily wanted to seek agreement at this meeting on the issue of the military obligations borne by the member states of the Southeast Asia group. It also wanted the Philippine Magsaysay group and the Australian Menzies government to come forward to promote the United States' plans in this regard. The Philippine Magsaysay group has been particularly enthusiastic in its clamoring. Philippine government officials have repeatedly asserted that the Southeast Asia group must be organized in the same way as the North Atlantic group, and that each member state must "automatically" support any U.S. acts of aggressive war. There are reports that the Philippine government is also preparing to suggest at the Manila meeting that an eight-nation "Asian Army" be established for the United States to drive. Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Garcia stated on the 18th that the Philippines is prepared to "provide manpower to support a Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in the form of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The Australian government is also actively supporting the U.S. plan. Australian Prime Minister Menzies said on the 24th that Australia is prepared to undertake definite military obligations to the Southeast Asia group. He also said, "Whatever such obligations involve, Australia will and must accept them."

However, as the date of the Manila meeting approaches, more and more news of disagreements among the participating countries has been revealed. Sources say that Britain and France do not agree with the Philippines and the United States' proposal to stipulate that member states of the Southeast Asia group undertake the obligation to take "immediate, automatic action" when the United States engages in aggression. Britain and France believe that only obligations for "voluntary action" should be undertaken. Britain insists that Taiwan, occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, should not be included in the "protection" scope of the Southeast Asia group. It is reported that Britain has already submitted proposed amendments to the Southeast Asia group's draft regulations in these areas. In addition, according to a United Press International report from London, Britain and the United States also disagree on the location of the proposed headquarters of the Southeast Asia group, with Britain advocating for Singapore and the United States advocating for the Philippines. UPI reported that this issue is expected to cause fierce debate at the meeting.

New Zealand Foreign Minister Webb said in Parliament on the 24th that New Zealand "will not make hasty decisions" at the Manila meeting to discuss the Southeast Asia group.

Thai Prime Minister Luang Phibunsongkhram said on the 17th that Thailand did not undertake any obligations in advance by participating in the meeting to discuss the Southeast Asia group.

The Pakistani government recently reiterated that it had not undertaken any obligations in advance by participating in the meeting to discuss the Southeast Asia group. Pakistani Prime Minister Ali said on the 23rd that Pakistan has not yet made a decision on whether to join the Southeast Asia group. According to Agence France-Presse, Pakistani diplomatic figures pointed out that Pakistan is the only Colombo Conference country participating in the meeting to discuss the Southeast Asia group (India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon have all refused to participate), so they are concerned that Pakistan's "close cooperation" with the United States would "risk further isolation."

This situation on the eve of the Manila meeting has made the Philippines, which is actively following Washington, worried about the future of the meeting.

### 美国加紧筹备拼凑东南亚侵略集团的会议

    美国加紧筹备拼凑东南亚侵略集团的会议
    【新华社二十六日讯】美国正在加紧筹备拼凑东南亚侵略集团的会议，这个会议定在九月六日在菲律宾首都马尼拉开幕。美国和其他宣布要参加这个会议的七国代表正在华盛顿忙着商讨东南亚集团规章草案。美国已提出它草拟的规章草案分送给这七个国家的政府。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯二十四日在华盛顿记者招待会上宣布，他计划在八月三十一日动身前往菲律宾，在九月四日左右开始先与菲律宾官员商讨“美菲联防条约”的进一步实施问题，接着参加六日开始的讨论成立东南亚集团的会议。杜勒斯表示，美国要根据它目前和菲律宾及李承晚集团分别缔结的双边条约、以及和澳大利亚及新西兰缔结的条约的方式，来规定参加东南亚集团的国家应该承担的军事义务。
    早在八月中旬宣布举行筹组东南亚集团的会议时，美国方面就表示，美国首先着重要在这次会议上就东南亚集团成员国承担的军事义务问题寻求协议，并且由菲律宾麦格赛赛集团和澳大利亚孟席斯政府出面来鼓吹美国在这方面的计划。菲律宾麦格赛赛集团叫嚷得特别卖劲。菲律宾政府官员一再主张东南亚集团必须按照北大西洋集团那样组织起来，各成员国必须“自动”地支持美国的任何侵略战争行动。有消息说，菲律宾政府并准备在马尼拉会议上建议成立一支八国“亚洲军”，供美国驱使。菲律宾副总统兼外交部长加西亚十八日表示，菲律宾已准备“提供人力来支持一个北大西洋公约组织形式的东南亚公约组织”。澳大利亚政府也积极支持美国的打算。澳大利亚总理孟席斯二十四日说，澳大利亚准备承担东南亚集团的肯定的军事义务。他并且说，“不论这种义务牵涉到什么，澳大利亚将会而且必须要加以接受。”
    但是，随着马尼拉会议会期的迫近，关于参加会议的国家间意见分歧的消息也越来越多地透露出来了。有消息说，英国和法国不赞成像菲律宾和美国所主张的那样，规定东南亚集团成员国在美国进行侵略时承担采取“立即的、自动的行动”的义务。英国和法国的意见是只承担“志愿行动”的义务。英国主张不把蒋介石卖国集团盘踞下的台湾包括在东南亚集团的“保护”范围之内。消息说，英国在这些方面已对东南亚集团规章草案提出了修正建议。另外，据合众社伦敦消息报道，英国和美国在拟议中的东南亚集团总部的地址上也意见分歧，英国主张设在新加坡，而美国主张设在菲律宾。合众社消息说，预料这个问题要在会议上引起激烈争吵。
    新西兰外交部长韦伯二十四日在议会中说，在讨论东南亚集团的马尼拉会议上，新西兰“不会作出草率的决定”。
    泰国政府总理銮披汶十七日说，泰国参加讨论东南亚集团的会议，事先并未承担义务。
    巴基斯坦政府最近重申它参加讨论东南亚集团的会议事先并未承担义务。巴基斯坦总理阿里二十三日说，巴基斯坦对于是否参加东南亚集团问题还没有作出决定。据法新社报道，巴基斯坦外交界人士指出，巴基斯坦是参加讨论东南亚集团会议的唯一的科伦坡会议国家（印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和锡兰都拒绝参加），因此他们担心巴基斯坦和美国“密切合作”，就会“冒进一步处于孤立地位的危险”。
    马尼拉会议前夕这样一片景况，已使积极追随华盛顿的菲律宾对会议前途表示担忧。
