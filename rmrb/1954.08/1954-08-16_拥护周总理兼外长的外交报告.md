    Written Statement by Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association
    Premier Zhou recently made a diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. In the report, he thoroughly analyzed the significant achievements of the Geneva Conference and vividly explained our country's current diplomatic policies and tasks. The Central People's Government Committee approved this report and called on the people of the whole country to fight for the liberation of Taiwan.
    On behalf of all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association, I express warm support for Premier Zhou's diplomatic report and the great call to liberate Taiwan. We believe that this call represents the common will and determination of the 600 million Chinese people, and we are willing to contribute our strength to this sacred cause.
    Taiwan is an inviolable sacred territory of China, and the liberation of Taiwan is a legitimate action for the Chinese people to defend their territory and sovereignty. The Chinese people cannot tolerate the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang colluding with the American aggressors to occupy Taiwan, turning Taiwan into an American colony and a military base attempting to attack the mainland.
    The Geneva Conference has made significant achievements in easing international tensions, and the liberation of Taiwan is to consolidate and develop this achievement. Judging from the various evil provocative activities of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang and the American warmongers in recent years and recently, the liberation of Taiwan is also to further guarantee peace in the Far East and the world.
    The Chinese people have the confidence and determination to realize the glorious cause of liberating Taiwan. We will not forget the devastation and oppression of the Chinese people by imperialism and feudalism for over a century. We will not forget the countless evil deeds done by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang during their more than 20 years in power, bringing disaster to the country and the people. I think private industrialists and businessmen will not forget how the four major families plundered the people's property through fake legal currency, fake gold yuan notes, exorbitant taxes and levies, and other evil means during the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek; how American goods flooded all parts of China like a tide, occupying the entire market; and how low the purchasing power of the people across the country was, all of which brought the national industry and commerce to the brink of extinction. We will not forget how Old China was looked down upon internationally. In the past, I had been to foreign countries eight times, and each time it aroused infinite feelings, hating the reactionary government at that time for being too corrupt and the country's international status being too low. What is the situation today? Less than five years after the founding of New China, from my work in the central government, inspections in various places, and contact with people from all walks of life, based on countless personally witnessed facts, I believe that fundamental changes have taken place in all aspects of the entire country. Our country has achieved unprecedented unity, various constructions have made unprecedented development, and the people are living a progressive and happy life. Everyone is working with unparalleled enthusiasm to build their motherland into a socialist country. All of this far exceeds the imagination of many people at the beginning of liberation. In recent years, under the support, adjustment and guidance of the state, private industrial and commercial enterprises have continuously increased in terms of the total value of industrial production, the turnover of commerce and profits. Since studying the general line of the country, the awareness of private industrialists and businessmen has been significantly improved. Many advanced elements have expressed their support for the general line with practical actions, putting their enterprises on the track of state capitalism. Not only has production developed, but also management is beneficial. At the same time, they are working hard to study, taking pride in becoming citizens of a socialist society in the future. Private industrialists and businessmen realize that sincerely accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government and following Chairman Mao is their bright future. Our country's international status has been unprecedentedly improved, Chinese people are respected abroad, and in many countries, the status of overseas Chinese has also changed. These are all things that every Chinese person should be proud of. While living such a happy life, we will not forget that the compatriots in Taiwan, the industrialists and businessmen in Taiwan, are still under the brutal oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang and American imperialism, enduring exorbitant taxes and levies, rising prices, and a life of utter misery. Naturally, we will also not forget the increasingly rampant harassment of our southeastern coastal areas and islands by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang and the American aggressors in recent years. The losses caused by the "February 6th" bombing among the residents of Shanghai only increase the people of the whole country's deep hatred for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang and strengthen the determination to liberate Taiwan. The contrast of these facts makes us love our motherland more, makes us sympathize more with the situation of our Taiwan compatriots, and thus makes us more deeply aware that liberating Taiwan is the responsibility of every Chinese person, and also the responsibility of every patriotic private industrialist and businessman. We must regard the liberation of Taiwan as the most important task of the people of the whole country at present, and realize that we must do a good job in all positions in order to form a great force. To this end, private industrialists and businessmen must enthusiastically love the country, abide by the law, actively produce and operate, and accept socialist transformation, so that their enterprises can fully play a positive role that is conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood.
    Compatriots in Taiwan! Industrialists and businessmen in Taiwan! Only by liberating Taiwan can you be freed from a life of suffering. We hope that you will take various methods to wage a resolute struggle against the handful of traitors and American aggressors who are riding on your heads.
    Let us all work harder, fight for the liberation of Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang, and finally complete the sacred liberation cause of the Chinese people! (Xinhua News Agency)

    Written Statement by Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce
    Regarding Premier Zhou Enlai兼Foreign Minister's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, I represent the national industrialists and businessmen in expressing warm support and paying sincere respect to the delegation headed by Premier Zhou.
    We firmly support the agreements reached at the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina, and are willing to make the greatest efforts for the thorough implementation of the agreements. The victory of the Geneva Conference shows that the principles of peaceful consultation and peaceful coexistence have become the common demands of the people of the world.
    We firmly advocate continuing to resolve the Korean political issue. Since the Geneva Conference has reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, it has set an example for the resolution of the Korean political issue. Therefore, the Korean political issue should continue to be resolved in accordance with the suggestions made by Foreign Minister Molotov, Foreign Minister Nam Il, and Premier Zhou Enlai兼Foreign Minister.
    We fully support the five principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence of our Central People's Government to consolidate and develop our country's peaceful cooperation relations with all countries in the world and to ensure peace and security in Asia and the world.
    We firmly support the call of the Central People's Government to fight for the liberation of Taiwan, the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, and the final completion of the sacred liberation cause of our Chinese people.
    Taiwan is the sacred and inviolable territory of our country, and the liberation of Taiwan is the sacred responsibility of our people. Our country's territory and sovereignty will never allow the United States to invade and interfere. As Premier Zhou said: "China has no intention of invading the territory of other countries, and will never tolerate other countries invading China's territory. China has no intention of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries, and will never tolerate other countries infringing upon China's sovereignty. China has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and will never tolerate other countries interfering in China's internal affairs. China will never threaten the security of other countries, and will never tolerate other countries threatening China's security." Therefore, our Central People's Government has the right to liberate Taiwan, and the American aggressors have no right to obstruct it. Our Central People's Government has the right to suppress Chiang Kai-shek, the bandit who rebels against the motherland, and the American aggressors have no right to interfere.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people of our country have never forgotten the Taiwan compatriots who are in dire straits. Since the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group was driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people and colluded with the American aggressors to occupy Taiwan, they have even more unscrupulously plundered the wealth of the Taiwan compatriots, sold out Taiwan's sovereignty, forced Taiwan youths to serve as cannon fodder, massacred large numbers of patriotic Taiwan compatriots, and constantly harassed and carried out destructive wars in our coastal areas; robbed and massacred fishermen; dispatched and airdropped special agents to infiltrate our mainland to carry out assassinations; and colluded with the American aggressors to seize and detain ships from various countries coming to our country for trade with piracy, creating international tensions. Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and the American aggressors planned to sign a so-called "joint security bilateral treaty" in an attempt to permanently turn Taiwan into a colony of the United States. These heinous crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and the American aggressors are intolerable to the people of our country and are not allowed by the Taiwan compatriots and the people of the world.
    The failure to liberate Taiwan means that our territory is not completely unified, our sovereignty is not complete, our liberation cause is not completed, and the security of the country and peace in Asia are not guaranteed, so the people of the country cannot rest easy. In order to liberate the Taiwan compatriots from the oppression of the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitors, in order to finally complete our sacred liberation cause, we call on the national industrialists and businessmen to unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, to give full play to the spirit of patriotism, with a hundredfold effort, love the country and abide by the law, practice strict economy, work hard in production, actively operate, and contribute all our strength to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan, defending Asian peace and world peace to the end!

    Guangdong Provincial People's Congress Meeting Passes Resolution in Support
    The First Session of the First Guangdong Provincial People's Congress was solemnly held in Guangzhou from August 1st to August 14th. On the closing day of the meeting, the 530 representatives attending the meeting saw Premier Zhou Enlai兼Foreign Minister's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee and the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee on approving this diplomatic report. On the one hand, they unanimously expressed cheers, congratulations and full support for the unprecedented victory of the world's peaceful and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union at the Geneva Conference and the great achievements of our country's peaceful diplomacy. At the same time, they expressed unparalleled anger at the fact that American imperialism is still conspiring to undermine peace, carrying out arrogant provocations, and attempting to occupy our territory Taiwan for a long time. All the representatives unanimously passed the "Resolution on Supporting Premier Zhou Enlai兼Foreign Minister's Diplomatic Report and Responding to the Central People's Government's Call to Liberate Taiwan." The resolution pointed out that all the representatives felt infinitely excited about Premier Zhou Enlai兼Foreign Minister's diplomatic report and the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee on approving this diplomatic report, and expressed full support. The resolution said: "The various agreements on the restoration of peace in Indochina and other achievements of the Geneva Conference, the joint statement issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Myanmar after their talks based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence, and the statement of Premier Zhou's talks with the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, fully demonstrate the strength of the peaceful and democratic forces and the new historical victory of the world peace movement, and also reflect the great victory of our country's peaceful diplomatic policy following the Korean armistice." The resolution said: "Liberating Taiwan is the glorious historical task of the Chinese people, and the people of Guangdong bear a major responsibility in the sacred cause of liberating Taiwan. This is because: Guangdong faces the ocean, is close to Taiwan, the bandits of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group often come to the coastal areas to carry out harassment, and the American aggressors have even sent naval and air forces to constantly demonstrate and provoke on the coastal border of our province. On July 26th, American military aircraft openly shot down two of our patrol planes over Hainan Island, which shows that only by eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and liberating Taiwan can the complete unification of the great motherland be realized, and further ensure peace and security in the Far East and the world. The people of Guangdong must fully support the Chinese People's Liberation Army and complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan. The Congress resolved: to resolutely respond to the call of the Central People's Government, unite the people of the province, educate the people of the province, strengthen work in all aspects, and strive to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, and finally complete the sacred liberation cause of our people!"

    拥护周总理兼外长的外交报告
    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培的书面谈话
    周总理最近在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上作了外交报告，在报告中他详尽地分析了日内瓦会议的重大成就，生动地说明了我国当前的外交政策和任务。中央人民政府委员会批准了这个报告，号召全国人民要为解放台湾而斗争。
    我代表中国民主建国会的全体成员，对于周总理的外交报告以及解放台湾的伟大号召，表示热烈的拥护，我们认为这个号召表现了六万万中国人民的共同意志和决心，我们愿意为了这个神圣的事业而贡献出自己的力量。
    台湾是中国神圣不可侵犯的领土，解放台湾是中国人民保卫自己的领土、主权的正当行动。中国人民不能容忍蒋介石卖国匪帮勾结美国侵略者盘踞台湾，把台湾变成美国的殖民地和企图进攻大陆的军事基地。
    日内瓦会议在缓和国际紧张局势的工作上获得了重大的成就，解放台湾就是巩固和发展这个成就。从蒋介石卖国匪帮和美国好战分子这几年来及最近的种种罪恶的挑衅活动看来，解放台湾也就是为了进一步保障远东和世界的和平。
    中国人民是有信心、有决心来实现解放台湾这一光荣事业的。我们不会忘记百余年来帝国主义、封建主义对中国人民的摧残和压迫，我们不会忘记蒋介石卖国匪帮当政的二十多年中，做尽了祸国殃民的坏事。我想私营工商业者不会忘记，在蒋介石反动统治时期，四大家族如何通过伪法币、伪金圆券、苛捐杂税以及其他的罪恶方式，掠夺人民的财产；美国商品如何像潮水般地倾销中国各地，占领整个市场，全国人民的购买力是何等的低落，这一切使得全国工商业陷于奄奄一息的境地。我们不会忘记旧中国在国际上如何受人轻视，过去我曾经八次到过外国，每次都激起无限的感触，痛恨当时的反动政府太腐朽，国家的国际地位太低落。今天的情形怎样呢？新中国成立不到五年，就我在中央工作，到各地视察，以及与社会各方人士接触中，根据无数身亲目睹的事实，我认为：整个国家的各个方面都起了根本的变化，我们国家达到了空前未有的团结和统一，各项建设有了空前的发展，人民过着进步的幸福的生活，大家正在以无比的热情来把自己的祖国建设成为社会主义的国家。这一切一切远远超过了解放初期许多人的想像。私营工商业几年来在国家的扶植、调整与指导下，在工业的生产总值，商业的营业额以及利润等方面，不断地增长。自从学习国家总路线以后，私营工商业者的觉悟有了显著的提高，不少先进分子纷纷以实际的行动表示对于总路线的拥护，把自己的企业推上国家资本主义的轨道，不但生产发展，而且经营有利，同时努力学习，以自己将来能成为一个社会主义社会的公民为荣。私营工商业者认识到真诚接受中国共产党和人民政府的领导，跟着毛主席走，就是自己的光明前途。我们国家的国际地位空前提高，中国人在国外受人尊敬，在许多国家中，华侨的地位也有了改变。这都是每一个中国人值得自豪的事。在过着这样幸福的日子的同时，我们不会忘记台湾的同胞、台湾的工商业者尚在蒋介石卖国匪帮和美帝国主义的惨酷压迫下，忍受着横征暴敛、物价高涨、水深火热、痛苦不堪的生活。自然，我们也不会忘记蒋介石卖国匪帮和美国侵略者这几年来对我国东南沿海地区和岛屿的日益猖獗的侵扰，“二·六”轰炸在上海居民中所造成的损失，这只有增加全国人民对蒋介石卖国匪帮的切齿仇恨，更加强了解放台湾的决心。这些事实的对比，使我们更加热爱我们的祖国，使我们更加同情台湾同胞的境遇，因而使我们更加深切地认识，解放台湾，是每一个中国人的责任，也是每一个爱国的私营工商业者的责任。我们必须把解放台湾看作全国人民当前最重要的任务，而且认识必须做好各个岗位的工作，才能结成一个伟大的力量，为此，私营工商业者必须热烈地爱国守法，积极生产经营，接受社会主义改造，使自己的企业能充分发挥有利于国计民生的积极作用。
    台湾的同胞们！台湾的工商业者们！只有解放台湾，才能使你们脱离苦难的生活，希望你们采取各种各样的方式，与骑在你们头上的一小撮的卖国贼和美国侵略者作坚决的斗争。
    让我们大家加倍地工作，为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国匪帮，以最后完成中国人民的神圣解放事业而奋斗！　　　（新华社）
    全国工商联主任委员陈叔通的书面谈话
    对于周恩来总理兼外交部长在中央人民政府委员会三十三次会议上的外交报告，我代表全国工商业者表示热烈的拥护，并对以周总理为首的代表团致以诚挚的敬意。
    我们坚决拥护日内瓦会议达成的印度支那和平的协议，并愿为协议的彻底实现而尽最大的努力。日内瓦会议的胜利表明：和平协商与和平共处的原则，已成为全世界人民共同的要求。
    我们坚决主张继续解决朝鲜政治问题。日内瓦会议既已达成了恢复印度支那和平的协议，就为朝鲜政治问题的解决树立了榜样。因此，朝鲜政治问题，就应按照莫洛托夫外长、南日外务相和周恩来总理兼外长所提出的建议来继续解决。
    我们完全拥护我中央人民政府的互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，以巩固和发展我国与世界各国的和平合作关系，并保障亚洲及世界的和平与安全。
    我们坚决拥护中央人民政府的号召，为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团、最后完成我中国人民的神圣解放事业而奋斗。
    台湾是我国神圣不可侵犯的领土，解放台湾是我国人民神圣的责任，我国的领土和主权决不容许美国侵犯和干涉。正如周总理所说：“中国没有侵略别国领土的意图，也决不容忍别国侵略中国的领土。中国没有侵犯别国主权的意图，也决不容忍别国侵犯中国的主权。中国没有干涉别国内政的意图，也决不容忍别国干涉中国的内政。中国决不威胁别国的安全，也决不容忍别国威胁中国的安全。”因此，我中央人民政府有权解放台湾，美国侵略者无权阻扰，我中央人民政府有权镇压反叛祖国的蒋匪介石，美国侵略者无权过问。
    自中华人民共和国成立以来，我全国人民没有一刻忘记处在水深火热中的台湾同胞。蒋介石卖国集团自被中国人民赶出大陆勾结美国侵略者盘踞台湾之后，更敲骨吸髓地搜刮台湾同胞的财富，出卖台湾的主权，强迫台湾青年充当炮灰，大批屠杀台湾爱国同胞，并随时对我沿海地区进行骚扰和破坏性的战争；抢劫和屠杀渔民；派遣和空投特务潜入我内地进行暗害工作；又和美国侵略者勾结起来，以海盗行为，劫夺和扣留各国前来我国通商的船舶，制造国际紧张局势；最近蒋介石卖国集团与美国侵略者策划订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”，企图把台湾永久变为美国的殖民地。蒋介石卖国集团与美国侵略者这些滔天罪恶，是我全国人民所决不能容忍的，也是台湾同胞和世界人民所不能容许的。
    台湾未解放，就是我们的国土未完全统一，主权未完整，解放事业未完成，国家安全与亚洲和平无保障，全国人民决不能安枕的。为着把台湾同胞从美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国贼压迫下解放出来，为着最后完成我们的神圣解放事业，我们号召全国工商业者更紧密地团结在中国共产党周围，在毛主席领导下高度地发挥爱国主义精神，以百倍的努力，爱国守法，厉行节约，努力生产，积极经营，贡献一切力量，为完成解放台湾、保卫亚洲和平和世界和平的光荣任务而奋斗到底！

    广东省人民代表大会会议通过决议拥护
    广东省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议，于八月一日至八月十四日在广州市隆重举行。在会议闭幕的一天，出席这次会议的五百三十位代表，看到周恩来总理兼外长在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上的外交报告及中央人民政府委员会关于批准这个外交报告的决议，一方面对以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量在日内瓦会议上的空前胜利和我国和平外交的伟大成就，一致表示欢呼祝贺和完全拥护，同时，对美帝国主义仍然阴谋破坏和平，进行狂妄挑衅，妄图长期侵占我国领土台湾表示无比的愤怒。全体代表一致通过了“关于拥护周恩来总理兼外长的外交报告及响应中央人民政府解放台湾号召”的决议。决议指出：全体代表对周恩来总理兼外长的外交报告及中央人民政府委员会关于批准这个外交报告的决议都感到无限兴奋，并表示完全拥护。决议说：“日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的各项协议及其他成就，中印两国总理、中缅两国总理举行会谈之后根据和平共处的五项原则所发表的联合声明，周总理与德意志民主共和国总理会谈的声明，充分说明和平民主力量的强大与世界和平运动新的历史性的胜利，同时也反映了我国和平外交政策继朝鲜停战之后的又一次伟大胜利。”决议说：“解放台湾是中国人民光荣的历史任务，而我们广东人民，在解放台湾的神圣事业中负有重大的责任。这是由于：广东面临海洋，接近台湾，蒋介石卖国集团的匪徒常来沿海地区进行骚扰，美国侵略者更出动海军和空军不断在我省沿海边境示威寻衅，七月二十六日，美国军用飞机竟公然在我海南岛上空击落我巡逻机两架，这就说明只有消灭蒋介石卖国集团，解放台湾，才能实现伟大祖国的完全的统一，进一步保障远东及世界的和平与安全。广东人民必须全力支援中国人民解放军，完成解放台湾的光荣任务。大会决议：坚决响应中央人民政府的号召，团结全省人民，教育全省人民，从各方面加强工作，为解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，最后完成我国人民神圣的解放事业而奋斗！”
