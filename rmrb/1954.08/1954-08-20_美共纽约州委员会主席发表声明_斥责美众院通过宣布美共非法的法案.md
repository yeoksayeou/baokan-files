Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: TASS Washington, August 17th dispatch: The Chairman of the New York State Committee of the American Communist Party, Gilson, issued a statement to the press regarding the House of Representatives' passage of a bill outlawing the Communist Party.

The statement said: "The House of Representatives, without making any report, without any discussion, and without even printing the full text of the bill, passed the McCarthyist, anti-union, anti-constitutional bill, which is a sentence depriving citizens of their rights without allowing them to defend themselves." The statement pointed out that this vote "inevitably reminds the shocked world of Hitler's anti-communist policies, which were merely a smokescreen to conceal Hitler's deprivation of the rights of all citizens at home and the launching of wars of aggression abroad."

The statement pointed out, "The unions, which oppose many parts of this bill, understand that this bill is not merely a campaign conspiracy. They correctly estimate that this bill is also aimed at all unions." The statement said: "This police-state bill has not yet taken effect. Americans who support the Bill of Rights still have time to express their opposition to this bill to their representatives and the President."

Xinhua News Agency, August 18th dispatch: Washington news: Following the Senate, the US House of Representatives passed a bill on the 16th declaring the American Communist Party illegal. Like the Senate, the House of Representatives also adopted fascist legislative measures, hastily passing this bill.

The bill passed by the House of Representatives declares the Communist Party an illegal organization and stipulates that all rights of the Communist Party be deprived. The reason why the bill passed by the House of Representatives did not stipulate imprisonment for Communist Party members is simply because the House of Representatives believes that such a provision is superfluous, because the government authorities have already widely used the current Smith Act and McCarran Act to arbitrarily persecute Communist Party members.

When the House of Representatives voted on this bill, New York State Democratic Congressman Multer and North Dakota Republican Congressman Burdick voted against the bill. Burdick said that the reason he opposed the bill was because Congress was attempting to "make people's possible thoughts illegal."

This fascist bill passed by the House of Representatives has now been submitted to a joint conference of the Senate and House of Representatives for discussion.

    美共纽约州委员会主席发表声明
    斥责美众院通过宣布美共非法的法案
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿十七日讯：美国共产党纽约州委员会主席吉尔逊就众议院通过取缔共产党的法案向报界发表声明。
    声明说：“众议院没有作任何报告，没有经过任何讨论，甚至也没有印出法案的全文，就通过了麦卡锡主义的、反工会的、反宪法的法案，这个法案是剥夺公民权利而又不让人分辩的宣判。”声明指出，这次表决“不可避免地使为此震惊的世界想起希特勒的反共政策，而这种反共政策只不过是掩盖希特勒剥夺国内所有公民的权利、并向国外发动侵略战争的烟幕”。
    声明指出，“反对这个法案中的许多部分的工会明白，这个法案不仅仅是一个竞选的阴谋。它们正确地估计到这个法案也是针对着所有的工会的。”声明说：“这个警察式的法案还未生效。支持权利法案的美国人还来得及向自己的议员和总统表示反对这个法案。”
      【新华社十八日讯】华盛顿消息：美国众议院继参议院之后在十六日通过了宣布美国共产党非法的法案。和参议院一样，众议院也采用了法西斯式的立法手段，草草地通过了这个法案。
    众议院通过的法案宣布共产党为非法团体，并规定剥夺共产党的一切权利。众议院通过的法案没有规定对共产党党员判处徒刑，其原因只不过是因为众议院认为，这样一个规定是多余的，因为政府当局早已广泛利用目前的史密斯法和麦卡伦法来任意迫害共产党员。
    在众议院表决这个法案时，纽约州民主党众议员穆尔特和北达科他州共和党众议员伯迪克投票反对这个法案。伯迪克说，他所以反对这个法案，是因为国会企图“使人们可能有的思想成为非法”。
    众议院通过的这个法西斯法案目前已提交参众两院联席会议讨论。
