    Performing the Task of Defending the Motherland, Resolutely Liberating Taiwan
    -- A Record of Soldiers in a Certain Platoon of the People's Liberation Army Discussing the Draft Constitution
    Yu Ming
    The soldiers of the Second Platoon, First Company, of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed on a certain island in the southeast of the motherland, participated in the battles to liberate Jinan and Luoyang, and the Huaihai Campaign. Later, they also participated in the crossing-the-Yangtze River campaign and the liberation of a certain island. Now, they are vigilantly defending the motherland's coastal defense and the happy life of the people. During a discussion meeting on the draft constitution, they expressed their warm support for it, their determination to fulfill the tasks of the people's armed forces, and their firm will to liberate Taiwan. The following are their statements during the discussion.
    Meng Fanting: When I saw the draft constitution, I felt that the provisions in it further guarantee the realization of socialism. I have been in the revolutionary ranks for more than ten years, and I am truly happy from the bottom of my heart to see such a constitution being implemented in our country. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, when I was climbing a ladder to attack a city, the platoon leader once told me, "Don't forget that your family is suffering from the oppression and exploitation of landlords and bureaucrats." Under this class education, I quickly climbed up the city and fought the enemy with bayonets. At that time, I didn't think about anything else, just that my family was poor peasants, and if we didn't eliminate the enemy, we wouldn't have a way to live. If we didn't eliminate the enemy, all other oppressed people couldn't live well either. Later, in every battle in Shandong and to liberate a certain island, whenever I thought of my family and the oppressed compatriots, my fighting spirit became even greater. Now, I clearly see that we have not only eliminated the oppression and exploitation of landlords and bureaucratic capital, and are living a happy life, but everyone is also working hard to build a socialist society. The draft constitution states that this is the victorious achievement of the Chinese people's revolution. As an old soldier, I feel this very deeply. The draft constitution stipulates that the task of our people's armed forces is to defend these achievements and safeguard the security and territorial integrity of the motherland. We will certainly work hard to defend what we shed blood and fought for ourselves. As for the territory of the motherland, we are actively preparing to liberate Taiwan here. As a platoon leader, I must lead everyone to learn the techniques well and complete the task of defending the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the motherland.
    Tang Zhaoyun: Article 2 of the General Principles of the draft constitution states that all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The fact that the people are discussing the draft constitution today, offering opinions on it, and electing their own representatives to manage the affairs of the country shows that the people are truly masters of their own affairs. I remember that during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, we also elected representatives to the fake National Assembly. A township head named Cai Xiaoan, relying on his brother being an official outside, threatened the people to vote for him. If they didn't vote for him, they would be bullied. At that time, the people secretly said, "When will we have true democracy?" Now it seems that the people's wishes have already been realized, haven't they? Before crossing the Yangtze River, our slogan was "Cross the Yangtze River and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive," because Chiang Kai-shek was too bad. As long as he was there, we would have no democratic rights. However, after we crossed the Yangtze River, Chiang Kai-shek sneaked away. In order to eliminate him, we are studying and training hard here every day. Because Taiwan has not yet been liberated, our Taiwanese compatriots are still suffering from the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and our task of liberating all of China has not yet been completed. When we mention the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, everyone hates them to the extreme. We are directly responsible for liberating Taiwan, and we must do a good job in defending the motherland in accordance with the provisions of the draft constitution, and successfully complete the task of liberating Taiwan.
    Zhou Weizheng: After the draft constitution was announced, we studied it; now we have to discuss it, and let everyone express their opinions on the draft constitution, which really makes me happy. The officers of the Kuomintang reactionary army used to make a fuss about the fake constitution and the fake National Assembly, but the ordinary soldiers didn't even dare to ask about it. When I joined the People's Liberation Army, I saw that the comrades of the Liberation Army loved the people and the motherland so much, and my thinking quickly changed. I followed everyone across the Yangtze River and across the sea, and I was not afraid of any hardship, because I slowly understood that our task is to liberate all of China and protect the people's increasingly better lives. Recently, the newspaper published an editorial saying that we must liberate Taiwan, which made us very excited. We also heard that the United States is making some kind of treaty with Chiang Kai-shek, and is provoking us everywhere, which makes the comrades very angry. We must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang bandit army.
    Zheng Genliang: The constitution can further consolidate the victorious achievements of the Chinese people. These achievements are very important to everyone, and they are also important to me. Before liberation, Zhao Fangcheng, the township head of the Kuomintang reactionaries, arrested my brother from the paddy field for no reason. My father begged the fake Baozhang (local head) for help, and the fake Baozhang asked my family to give him seven thousand catties of grain before he would help. My father had no choice but to agree. He took our house, leaving my family bankrupt, and we still haven't paid him off. After that, my family worried about this debt every year. My brother was forced to run away because of this debt. The fake Baozhang arrested me and asked me to eat my own food and work for him to pay off the debt. Thinking about that kind of life, where did the people before liberation have any rights and freedom! Since the founding of New China, the economy and culture have greatly developed. Take us soldiers for example, in the old society, very few people were literate, but now it's like we've entered school. In the past few years, we've all learned to read, which has given us the conditions to master modern weapons. After studying the draft constitution, I understand even more clearly who I am fighting for today. I want to study technology well and prepare to liberate our territory of Taiwan!
    Zhang Shuqin: Take my family as an example. My family now has land, and we live a very good life. My two older brothers are both working cadres in government agencies. In the past, how could a family like ours, which relied on herding cattle for others, have been able to work in the government? Now that I have studied the draft constitution, I know that this is because the nature of our country has changed. Our country is now led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. The draft constitution clearly points this out. We must do more publicity to the masses. The people on the mainland of the motherland are already living a happy life and are on the road to socialism, but the people of Taiwan are still in darkness. We must take on the task of liberating Taiwan.
    Shu Shurui: The draft constitution states that the personal freedom of citizens is inviolable. However, under Kuomintang rule, personal freedom was not guaranteed at all. One year, just before the New Year, I went out for a while and was arrested by the Kuomintang bandits. My family didn't even know where I had gone. However, after liberation, personal freedom is indeed inviolable, and the army and the people get along like one family. In the recent general election, my grandmother, who is over eighty years old, also participated in the election. She happily asked someone to write me a letter saying that she has lived for more than eighty years, and this is the first time she has had the right to vote. My family was given land after liberation, and life is not difficult. Now that I think about it, we are living a very good life, and we also have various democratic rights, which is really great. In the future, I will resolutely implement the provisions of the constitution and make contributions to the people.
    Chen Dingchu: In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people simply didn't know about the constitution, because they didn't dare let the people discuss it. They said that China couldn't have democracy, and that democracy would cause "chaos." This was all because the reactionaries had a guilty conscience. Now, the draft constitution states that labor is a glorious thing, but in the past, labor was the most despised. In the past, there was no freedom for the working people, only the freedom of the ruling class to fire guns. They could kill people at will, on the grounds that the people wanted to "rebel." Although we have such a good life now, we are not happy until Taiwan is liberated. Our team is the people's team, and liberating Taiwan is our responsibility. We want to create new honors in the battle to liberate Taiwan.
    Kong Jinsheng: I joined the revolutionary ranks at the age of fourteen. I remember that once when we were withdrawing from a place in Shandong, more than two thousand people demanded that they had to leave with us. They felt that without our revolutionary ranks, they wouldn't be able to live. They said: Following you is following Chairman Mao. Now it seems that what the people said is really right. Aren't the citizens' rights stipulated in the draft constitution obtained by the people following Chairman Mao? In order to protect such a good motherland, I have been studying and training hard with everyone on the island for several years. In the future, I will continue to work hard to improve my skills and strive to liberate Taiwan!
    Gong Shengzong: In the old society, the Kuomintang reactionaries oppressed and exploited the people terribly. The Baozhang would arrest people at will. After I was taken away by the Kuomintang Baozhang, I was tied up and sent to the army. Personal freedom was not guaranteed at all. Now, when I see the basic rights and obligations of citizens stipulated in the draft constitution, I feel that personal freedom will never be violated again. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led our people to seize the knife handle, and that's how we got these things. In the Liberation War, I was liberated from the fire pit, joined my own army, lived a collective and happy life, and learned technology and culture. It's really happiness. U.S. imperialism is not willing to let us live a good life, and has recently provoked us in Hainan Island. We are really angry. We are not afraid of U.S. imperialism. We must liberate Taiwan and implement the provisions of the draft constitution regarding our people's armed forces.
    Cui Hengming: After reading the draft constitution, I tossed and turned all night and couldn't sleep. I think about the citizens' rights stipulated in the draft constitution, and we have already obtained them. The constitution also protects these rights. How big is the difference between this and before liberation! At that time, I remember that my father said something casually and offended a landlord. The landlord set fire to a small pile of firewood himself, but falsely accused my father of arson. He not only detained him, but also arrested me. We spent a lot of money to beg for favors, and were beaten by the landlord before we were released. At that time, the people couldn't even protect their lives, so how could they talk about democratic rights! I also remember that there was a locust plague in my county in the past, and the crops suffered great losses. The people wanted to fight the locusts, but the landlord was afraid that the locusts would be driven to his land, so he asked the reactionary government to prohibit the people from fighting the locusts. As a result, the people didn't even get anything to eat. However, now, as soon as there are locusts, the People's Government not only organizes the masses to fight them, but also uses airplanes to help the masses eliminate the locusts. Isn't it very clear that that government represents the interests of the people? The draft constitution also stipulates that socialism is the goal that all our people are striving for. Whoever violates socialist interests will be breaking the law. Although life was hard during the Liberation War, we were very determined in carrying out our tasks. Why were we able to do this? It's because we were single-mindedly trying to liberate all of China, and to seize the "knife handle." Now that the "knife handle" has been seized by the people, with it, there is the people's democratic rights and everything for the people. We must protect this people's country well.

    执行保卫祖国的任务，坚决解放台湾
    ——记人民解放军某部一个排的战士讨论宪法草案
    于明
    驻守祖国东南某海岛的人民解放军某部一连二排的战士们，曾参加过解放济南、洛阳的战役，参加过淮海战役，以后又参加了渡江和解放某海岛的战役。现在，他们警惕地保卫着祖国的海防，保卫着祖国人民的幸福生活。他们在一次座谈会上讨论宪法草案时，表示了对宪法草案的热烈拥护，表示了执行人民武装力量的任务的决心，并表示了解放台湾的坚决意志。下面就是他们在讨论时的发言。
    孟范亭：我看到宪法草案时，就觉得这个宪法草案里的规定，使得社会主义的实现有了进一步的保证。我参加革命队伍十几年，看到这样的宪法就要在我国实行，真是打心里高兴。在抗日战争中，我有一次爬梯子攻城时，排长曾对我说，你不要忘记家里的人在受地主、官僚的压迫和剥削。我在这种阶级教育下，很快爬上城去和敌人拼刺刀，那时什么都不想，只想着自己的家庭是贫农，不消灭敌人，就没有活的日子；不消灭敌人，一切其他受压迫的人民也不能很好生活下去。以后每次在山东和解放某海岛的战斗中，我都是一想到自己的家和受压迫的同胞，战斗的劲头就更大了。现在，我清楚地看到，我们不但消灭了地主、官僚资本的压迫和剥削，过上了幸福的生活，并且大家都在努力建设社会主义社会了。宪法草案里说，这是中国人民革命的胜利成果，作为一个老战士来说，我对这一点是感受很深的。宪法草案中规定了，我们人民武装力量的任务，就是保卫这些成果、保卫祖国安全和领土主权的完整。我们自己流血战斗得来的东西，当然要努力保卫；至于祖国的领土，我们在这里正积极准备解放台湾，我是一个排长，一定要带领大家学好技术，完成保卫祖国领土和主权完整的任务。
    汤昭云：宪法草案总纲第二条说，中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民今天讨论宪法草案，对宪法草案提意见，又选举自己的代表管理国家的大事，就说明人民真正当家作主了。记得国民党反动派统治时，我们那里也选举过伪国大的代表，有个乡长名字叫蔡小安，仗着他哥哥在外边做官，就威胁老百姓选他一票，不选他的就要受到欺侮。那时，老百姓都暗暗说，什么时候才能有真正的民主呢？现在看来，老百姓的这种愿望，不是已经都实现了吗？我们在渡江以前，提出的口号是“打过长江去，活捉蒋介石”，就是因为蒋介石太坏了，有他在，我们就没有民主权利。可是，我们渡了江，蒋介石却偷跑了；为了消灭它，我们每天都在这里苦学苦练。因为台湾还没有解放，我们的台湾同胞还在受蒋介石匪帮的压迫，我们解放全中国的任务还没有完成。一提到蒋介石匪帮，大家就痛恨到极点了。我们直接负有解放台湾的责任，我们一定按照宪法草案里的规定，做好保卫祖国的工作，胜利完成解放台湾的任务。
    周维正：宪法草案公布以后，我们进行了学习；现在还要讨论，让每个人都发表自己对宪法草案的修改意见，这真是使我高兴。国民党反动军队的军官们曾闹什么伪宪法、伪国大，可是一般的士兵连问都不敢问。我参加人民解放军，一看到解放军同志们都是那样爱人民、爱祖国，自己的思想很快就转变了，我跟着大家渡江、渡海，吃多大的苦也不怕，因为我慢慢懂得，我们的任务是解放全中国，保卫人民一天比一天过好的生活。最近，报纸上发表社论说，我们一定要解放台湾，我们听了十分兴奋。我们又听说美国在和蒋介石在搞什么条约，到处挑衅，同志们听了都很气愤。我们一定要解放台湾，一定要消灭蒋匪军。
    郑根良：宪法能进一步巩固中国人民的胜利成果。这些成果对每个人都很重要，对我也是一样。在解放以前，国民党反动派的乡长赵房成，把我哥哥无缘无故就从稻田里抓了去。父亲到伪保长那里求情，伪保长要我家出七千斤谷子才肯帮忙。父亲没有办法，只好答应了他。他要了我们的房子，弄得我家里倾家荡产，也还没有给清他。以后，我家每年都为这笔债发愁。我哥哥为这笔债逼得偷跑了，伪保长把我抓起来，要我吃自己的饭，给他做工顶债款。想想那种生活，解放前的人民那里还有丝毫权利和自由！新中国成立以来，经济、文化都有很大发展，就拿我们战士来说，过去在旧社会里很少识字的，可是现在好像进了学校一样，几年来都认得字了，这使我们有了掌握现代化武器的条件了。我在学习宪法草案以后，更明白今天是为谁当兵了，我要好好学习技术，准备解放我国的领土台湾！
    张树钦：拿我的家来说，我家里现在有了地，生活过得很好，两个哥哥都是政府机关的工作干部，要是在过去，像我们靠给别人放牛过活的家庭，那能到政府里去做事呢？现在学了宪法草案，我知道这是因为我们的国家性质变了，我们的国家现在是工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的国家，宪法草案里明确指明这一点。我们要多多向群众作宣传。祖国大陆上的人民已经过上幸福的生活，走上社会主义的道路，可是台湾人民还在黑暗中。我们一定要把解放台湾的任务担当起来。
    舒树瑞：宪法草案里说，公民的人身自由不受侵犯。可是在国民党统治时，人身自由却没有一点保障。有一年正要过年，我出去了一下，就被国民党匪军抓走了，家里的人连我到了什么地方都不知道。可是，解放后，人身自由确实不受侵犯了，军队和老百姓处得像一家人。在最近的普选中，我祖母八十多岁了，还参加了选举。她高兴的托人给我写信说，她活了八十多岁，这是第一次有了选举权。我们家在解放后分到了土地，生活也不困难了。现在想想，我们的生活过得满好，又有了各种的民主权利，真是高兴。将来我要坚决执行宪法中的规定，为人民立功。
    陈丁初：过去在国民党反动派统治时，老百姓根本就不知道宪法，因为他们不敢让人民讨论。他们说中国不能民主，民主了就要“乱”，这都是反动派作贼心虚。现在，宪法草案中说，劳动是光荣的事，可是过去劳动是最被人看不起的；过去，没有劳动人民的自由，只有统治阶级的放枪自由，他们随便打死人，理由是人民要“造反”。我们虽然有了现在这样好的生活，但是没有解放台湾，心里总是不痛快。我们的队伍是人民的队伍，解放台湾就是我们的职责。我们要在解放台湾战役中，创造新的荣誉。
    孔金升：我从十四岁上就参加了革命队伍。我记得，有一次我们从山东的一个地方撤走时，有二千多个老百姓要求，非和我们一起走不可，他们觉得，没有我们革命队伍，他们就活不下去。他们说：跟了你们走，就是跟了毛主席走。现在看来，老百姓的这些话说得真是对，宪法草案里规定的公民权利，不就是人民跟着毛主席走得来的吗？为了把这样好的祖国保卫好，我和大家在海岛上一起勤学苦练好几年了，今后还要继续努力提高技术，为解放台湾而奋斗！
    龚胜宗：在旧社会，国民党反动派把人民压迫剥削得不得了，保长要抓丁就抓丁。我被国民党的保长拉去以后，就缚起来，送到军队里。人身自由根本没有保障。现在，我看到宪法草案里规定的关于公民基本权利和义务，觉得人身自由再也不会受人侵犯了。共产党、毛主席领导我们人民把刀把子夺过来，才有这些东西。解放战争中，我从火坑里被解放出来，参加了自己的军队，过着集体愉快的生活，又学技术，又学文化，真是幸福。美帝国主义不甘心让我们过好生活，最近还在海南岛挑衅，我们真是愤恨，我们不怕美帝国主义，我们一定要解放台湾，执行宪法草案中关于我们人民武装力量的规定。
    崔恒明：看了宪法草案，我晚上翻来覆去睡不着觉。我想想宪法草案里规定的公民权利，都已得到了，宪法还要保护这些权利，这和解放前差别有多大啊！那时，我记得父亲说了一句淡话，就得罪了一家地主。那家地主自己把一小堆柴点起了火，却诬告我父亲放火，不但把他扣起来，还把我也抓起来，我们花了许多钱求人情，又挨了地主的打，才被放出来。那时人民连生命都保不住，还能谈什么民主权利！我还记得，过去我县里也闹过蝗虫，庄稼受到很大损失，老百姓要打蝗虫，地主怕把蝗虫赶到他的地里，就要求反动政府禁止人民打蝗虫，结果人民连吃的都没有捞到。可是，现在一有蝗虫，人民政府不但组织群众打，还用飞机帮助群众灭蝗，那个政府是代表人民利益的，这里看得不是很清楚吗？宪法草案里还规定，社会主义是我们全国人民努力的目标，谁要违背社会主义利益，谁就要犯法了。我们在解放战争中的生活虽然苦，执行任务却很坚决。为什么能够这样呢？就是因为我们一心想解放全中国，就是为了夺取“刀把子”。现在“刀把子”夺到人民手里了，有了它，就有人民的民主权利和人民的一切了，我们要好好保住这个人民的国家。
