The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been published for two months. The nationwide campaign to discuss the Draft Constitution is now in full swing, forming a broad mass movement for the formulation of the constitution.

Before organizing the entire people to discuss the Draft Constitution, all localities conducted large-scale publicity activities among the people. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, former Liaoxi, Xinjiang, Shanghai, Harbin, Lushun-Dalian and other provinces and cities, the total number of publicity teams organized to publicize to the masses is more than 2.6 million. The broad masses of people have listened to reports on the Draft Constitution more than once. In Sichuan Province, propagandists and reporters have made approximately 150,000 propaganda appearances to urban and rural masses, with an audience of about 18 million. Some areas' propagandists and reporters even took radios deep into remote rural areas to organize farmers to listen to lectures on the Draft Constitution and news about discussions of the Draft Constitution in various places. Leading organs at the county level in 50 counties, including Tunliu in Shanxi Province, dispatched cadres carrying 850 radios to rural areas and mountainous areas to organize farmers to listen to broadcasts of the Draft Constitution. The discussion of the Draft Constitution is carried out on the basis of this extensive publicity. As of now, areas and units that started discussing earlier have ended or are about to end; areas and units that started discussing later are still in progress. The Draft Constitution discussion activities in various places started with cadres first, and then gradually unfolded enthusiastically among the masses. Many units in central government organs and central organs of democratic parties have concluded discussions. The discussion of people from all walks of life in Beijing is entering the stage of discussing chapter by chapter and article by article. The discussion of cadres at the provincial and special commissioner levels in Hebei Province ended in early August, and the discussion among the masses is continuing. The provincial-level organs of Shanxi Province, as well as various people's organizations and industrial and mining enterprises, are conducting discussions under the leadership of eight branches of the Draft Constitution Discussion Committee. Cadres of organs in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region concluded their discussions at the end of July and the beginning of August. In the Northeast region, counties and cities in the former Liaodong Province started discussions in early July, and some areas are nearing completion. In Jilin Province, more than 3,300 reporters and 113,300 propagandists and propaganda activists are carrying out extensive publicity activities throughout the province. Many people have listened to reports three to eight times. The number of people participating in the discussion of the Draft Constitution in this province has reached more than 4,414,800. Now, the province's nationwide discussion has basically ended. Shanghai started a nationwide discussion after July 20. The discussion of 170,000 people in universities and middle schools ended at the end of July. The discussion of more than 962,000 workers and staff members in industrial and mining enterprises and the broad masses of citizens will end around August 20. The nationwide discussion in Shanghai is divided into two stages. The first stage is to organize the masses to listen to reports, have group discussions, and understand the spirit of the Draft Constitution; the second stage is to discuss it article by article. The discussion in rural areas of Fujian Province is divided into three batches based on the arrangement of local production plans. The first batch, consisting of 1,026 townships, has ended, the second batch, consisting of 1,516 townships, is about to end, and the third batch is just beginning. In the Northwest region, farmers in Shaanxi Province are forming groups to discuss, or are being led by reading groups to discuss. The discussion of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province is also actively underway. Some places in the Central and Southern regions suffered from floods this summer, but many places still persisted in discussing the Draft Constitution while controlling the floods. The broad commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are also actively participating in the discussion of the Draft Constitution.

The broad masses of people have shown high political enthusiasm in discussing the Draft Constitution. This summer, there was a lot of rain in various places, and people often braved the rain to go to meeting places to participate in discussions. Many workers and staff members of factories and mines voluntarily gave up their regular rest time to discuss the Draft Constitution. Liang Xiaoyi, a resident of Taiping District, Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province, originally planned to go to Guangzhou for medical treatment, but postponed her trip temporarily after hearing that the Draft Constitution was going to be discussed. Bookstores, libraries, and cultural stations in various places have prepared single copies of the Draft Constitution and various materials related to the constitution. Opinion boxes for the Draft Constitution have been set up on important streets in Beijing to facilitate people to express their opinions anytime and anywhere. Many technicians in factories and mines served as recorders during the workers' discussions, recording in detail the revisions proposed by the workers. Many people made detailed preparations before participating in the discussion. In addition to collective learning and discussion within the stipulated time, the broad masses of cadres also took time to study in depth many materials and relevant books on the constitution. Because the broad masses of people understood the great significance of formulating the constitution, they were able to actively put forward their own revision opinions in the discussion in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, so as to make the constitution more perfect. During the discussion by workers at the Beijing People's Printing Factory, all the different opinions on various articles were recorded in detail and submitted to higher authorities, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses in the discussion. Workers at the Beijing No. 4 Flour Mill, in their discussion, were particularly concerned about the connection between state organs and the people, and therefore, when discussing Article 17 of the General Program of the Draft Constitution, six people put forward five revision opinions. Kang Zhiyuan, a driver of the Beijing No. 10 public bus, originally thought that the Draft Constitution had already been discussed by more than 8,000 people from all walks of life, and it would be difficult for him to put forward any opinions. But he also thought: only in a democratic country like ours do the people have the right to discuss the constitution. In order to make the constitution more perfect, every citizen should give full play to their wisdom and actively put forward their opinions. Therefore, he carefully studied every article of the Draft Constitution, and in the article-by-article discussion, he also put forward revision opinions on individual articles of the Draft Constitution. Luo Zhifu, a professor at Beijing Normal University, had participated in the discussion of the initial draft of the constitution and had put forward revision opinions; after the Draft Constitution was published, he compared the Draft Constitution with the initial draft and found that many places had been revised, and some of the opinions he had put forward had also been adopted. He personally experienced the democratic spirit of formulating the constitution, and in the discussion of all teachers, students, and staff members of the school, he more actively studied and put forward opinions. In the discussion, the people actively put forward their various opinions, and at the same time repeatedly considered whether their opinions were completely correct. Huang Yongsheng, a worker at the Beijing Private Xin'ya Pharmaceutical Factory, put forward a revision opinion at the first discussion meeting, but after the meeting, he felt that it was not very appropriate, and in the second discussion, he put forward a second revision opinion. During this period of discussion, the people put forward tens of thousands of opinions on the Draft Constitution with the attitude of being masters of their own affairs. According to preliminary statistics from Beijing alone, as of August 3, people from all walks of life in the city had put forward more than 24,000 opinions. Preliminary statistics from Shanghai, Shenyang, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Harbin, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Lushun-Dalian, Jinan, Qingdao and other provinces and cities show that people from all walks of life put forward more than 7,480 opinions in the discussion (many areas have merged repeated opinions). These opinions are being reported level by level and will eventually be submitted to the Constitution Drafting Committee.

During this period, people's congresses at the county level across the country, except for a very few counties in Anhui Province, have held meetings and discussed the Draft Constitution. More than 17,000 representatives from more than 80 counties and cities in Zhejiang Province participated in the discussion of the Draft Constitution, generally discussing it for two days. The people's congress meetings held in various places all made resolutions to support the Draft Constitution, and many units also made plans to publicize the Draft Constitution. After the meeting, the representatives actively publicized it to the voters. Recently, the provincial-level people's congress meetings that have been held or are being held in various places have also seriously discussed the Draft Constitution.

The publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution in various places are generally closely integrated with local production and central work. The publicity and discussion activities of the Draft Constitution not only did not affect production and work, but also played a positive role in promoting production and work. Industrial and mining enterprises combined production with publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution, mainly on the one hand, to use the gaps in production to conduct it, and on the other hand, in the publicity and discussion, to organically link the content of the Draft Constitution with the production situation of the unit and the ideological situation of the workers, so that the masses can not only clearly understand the content of the Draft Constitution, but also further improve their political enthusiasm and better solve the problems existing in production. Before conducting large-scale publicity and organizing discussions among workers and staff members, the Baoding Power Plant in Hebei Province held a meeting of propagandists to study the production situation and the ideological situation of the workers in the plant. At that time, the plant was promoting a technical reform movement. Some workers believed that the power plant had already been electrified and there was nothing to reform, while others were too ambitious and did not pay attention to starting with small things to reform. When publicizing the specific content of the Draft Constitution, the propagandists made publicity and explanations in light of the situation of the plant. For example, when talking about the great significance of formulating the constitution, they combined it with a comparison of the living conditions of workers in the plant before and after liberation; when explaining Articles 1 and 2 of the General Program, they combined it with explaining the political status of the working class and the role that workers should play in the country; when talking about the people's congress system, they combined it with explaining the examples of the plant electing representatives to attend the city people's congress; when talking about the basic rights and obligations of citizens, they combined it with the situation of workers in the plant receiving state commendation and rewards for labor, rest, and inventions; At the same time, it also combined with criticizing some incorrect ideas of the workers in the plant in the technical innovation movement, and put forward slogans such as "focus on innovation" and "collective creation," calling on workers to support the Draft Constitution with practical actions. After such publicity, the workers' political awareness was further improved, and a large number of activists and outstanding figures in technical innovation appeared in production. Before publicizing the Draft Constitution to workers and staff members, the reporter of the Second Workshop of the State-owned Andong Paper Mill also studied the main problems existing in production at that time, namely, low product quality, lax labor discipline, and the lack of unity among some technicians and old workers; when publicizing the Draft Constitution, in addition to giving positive guidance and explanation, explaining how workers should strengthen unity, strictly abide by labor discipline, and do a good job in production, so as to better play the leading role of the working class, it also paid attention to using the method of commending model figures in the plant to educate workers and staff members. In publicity and discussion, this workshop timely studied the ideological situation of the masses and the problems in production at each stage, and timely combined publicity and mass discussion to solve them, which played a great role in promoting production. In rural areas, the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution is also closely integrated with production. The Draft Constitution Discussion Committees at all levels above the county level in Shanxi Province and the office agencies for production, mutual aid and cooperation, summer conscription, and summer purchase are all under unified leadership, with division of labor and close cooperation. Cadres going to the countryside shoulder the dual tasks of publicizing the Draft Constitution and completing the central tasks. After insect pests occurred in the Yanbei area, more than 480 cadres were organized to go to eight counties including Pinglu, focusing on eliminating insect pests, and at the same time launched publicity of the Draft Constitution and organized the masses to discuss it. The Draft Constitution Publicity Group of Tianchi Township, Yibin City, Sichuan Province, and the work group that helped the masses establish agricultural production cooperatives in this township, achieved close contact and mutual cooperation in their work, so that the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution and agricultural production work achieved great results. They adopted two methods: one is to jointly arrange the time for publicity and meetings, and the other is to combine the two in terms of publicity content and discussion content. Before the establishment of the Tianchi Agricultural Production Cooperative, some farmers had concerns and were afraid of suffering losses by joining the cooperative. The Draft Constitution Publicity Group focused on explaining the provisions in the Draft Constitution regarding the state's encouragement and assistance to farmers in taking the road of cooperation, based on the ideological situation of the masses, and used the production achievements of the agricultural production cooperative in the township as a comparative explanation. Some farmers did not fully understand the current state policy of encouraging junior high school and senior elementary school graduates to participate in production, so the Constitution Publicity Group focused on explaining the provisions in the Draft Constitution regarding the glory of labor to the farmers, and made the farmers understand that cultural and educational undertakings must continue to develop on the basis of production development. Because it was able to carry out publicity targeted at the current ideological problems of farmers, the publicity and discussion activities of the Draft Constitution and production work have been well developed. According to a survey of two villages in this township, 94 percent of the households understood the main content of the Draft Constitution, and the work of establishing agricultural production cooperatives was also well developed. Farmers also launched summer fertilizer accumulation, weeding, and pest control work, expressing their support for the Draft Constitution.

The publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution directly inspired the enthusiasm of the broad working people to build socialism. Therefore, in the process of nationwide discussion of the Draft Constitution, many new achievements have emerged in industrial and agricultural production. The technical innovation movement in industrial and mining enterprises in various places has been further developed in the process of discussing the Draft Constitution. During the discussion of the Draft Constitution, workers at the Chongqing 101 Steel Plant, in view of the reasons for the poor completion of the production plan since April of this year, launched a technical innovation movement with the main content of "popularizing the eight major advanced experiences and trial-producing two new products." Workers in the newly built steelmaking workshop of this plant put forward many production suggestions through the discussion of the Draft Constitution, changed the chaotic situation before and after steel tapping, and enabled the steelmaking workshop to create a new record on July 30, shortening the smelting time per furnace from an average of six hours to five hours and twenty minutes. Yao Rongxiang, a technician in the steel casting group of the casting workshop of the East China Iron and Steel Company's No. 3 Plant, strengthened his sense of responsibility as the master of the country in the discussion of the Draft Constitution, and further realized the glory of working in our country. Therefore, he actively studied and improved the steel ingot mold die-casting method, and his work efficiency increased three times. Through the discussion of the Draft Constitution, workers and staff members of many factories and mines more consciously abided by labor discipline and strengthened their concept of cherishing public property. Li Qingshan, a lathe worker in the repair workshop of the Harbin Electric Machine Factory, produced 30 defective products in June. After discussing the Draft Constitution, he made a self-criticism and promised to abide by labor discipline, not to talk and laugh during production time, to work seriously, and to ensure the elimination of defective products. In one month, he did not produce a single defective product. Through the discussion of the Draft Constitution, farmers more clearly realized that mutual aid and cooperation is the road to socialism. Seventeen households in Yingtou Village, Xinqiao Township, Yongan County, Fujian Province, actively requested to participate in mutual aid groups after studying and discussing the Draft Constitution. Nine mutual aid groups in this township actively created conditions to strive to establish production cooperatives this year. Farmers in twelve mutual aid groups in Zhongyulin Village, Zhangjiakou Suburb, Hebei Province, revised their summer hoeing plan after discussing the Draft Constitution. Zuo Wenyao Mutual Aid Group in Dongyulin Village hoeed 78 mu of land ahead of schedule and also helped the families of martyrs and soldiers with no labor force to hoe 14 mu of land. In previous years, it took three or four days to complete the collection of agricultural taxes in Zucun Township, Dingxian County. This year, farmers realized that paying taxes according to law is an obligation that citizens should fulfill, and they completed the task in one day and put all the taxes into the treasury. Many farmers also actively supported the country's industrial construction and sold a large amount of surplus grain to the country. Wang Wanxing and Wang Liben, farmers in the Hanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, also specially composed a fast-paced song praising the Draft Constitution, expressing their joy. The fast-paced song wrote: The Draft Constitution has come to the countryside, and the tillers are overjoyed; The black and white words are clearly displayed, and the power of the state belongs to the people. The working brothers lead the way, and the farming brothers follow closely; Step by step, follow closely, and the factories are many and the granaries are full.

    宪法草案的宣传讨论推动了生产建设
    ——本报记者综合报道宪法草案公布两个月的情况
    中华人民共和国宪法草案公布已经两个月了。现在全民讨论宪法草案的活动已经在全国各地热烈展开，形成了广大群众性的制定宪法运动。
    各地在组织全体人民讨论宪法草案之前，都曾在人民群众中进行了大规模的宣传活动。根据河北、山西、山东、江苏、浙江、四川、云南、原辽西、新疆、上海、哈尔滨、旅大等省市极不完全的统计，为向群众进行宣传而组织的宣传队伍，总共有二百六十多万人。广大人民群众不止一次地听取了关于宪法草案的报告。四川省的宣传员和报告员前后曾向城乡群众作过约十五万次宣传，听众达一千八百万人左右。有些地区的宣传员和报告员还带着收音机深入到偏僻的农村，组织农民收听宪法草案讲座和各地讨论宪法草案的消息。山西省屯留等五十个县的县级领导机关，抽派干部携带了八百五十部收音机，深入农村和山区组织农民收听宪法草案的广播。宪法草案的讨论，就在这种广泛宣传的基础上进行。截至目前为止，讨论较早的地区和单位，已经结束或即将结束；讨论较晚的地区和单位则正在进行。各地宪法草案讨论活动，首先是从干部开始，然后逐渐在群众中热烈展开。中央各机关、各民主党派中央机关有许多单位已经结束讨论。北京市各界人民的讨论正进入逐章逐条讨论的阶段。河北省级和专署级机关干部的讨论，已于八月上旬结束，群众中的讨论正在继续进行。山西省级机关以及各人民团体和工矿企业单位，正由八个宪法草案讨论委员会分会领导进行讨论。内蒙古自治区机关干部已于七月底、八月初先后结束讨论。在东北地区，原辽东省各县市自七月上旬开始讨论，现在有些地区已近结束。吉林省有三千三百多名报告员和十一万三千三百多名宣传员和宣传积极分子，在全省广泛展开宣传活动，许多人听过三次到八次报告，这个省参加宪法草案讨论的人数已达到四百四十一万四千八百多人；现在该省全民讨论已基本结束。上海市自七月二十日以后开始了全民讨论。大中学校十七万人的讨论已在七月底结束。工矿企业参加讨论的九十六万二千余名职工和广大市民群众，约在八月二十日前后结束讨论。上海市的全民讨论分作两个阶段。第一阶段是组织群众听取报告，小组讨论、了解宪法草案的精神；第二阶段是逐条讨论。福建省各地农村的讨论，是根据当地生产计划的安排，共分三批进行。第一批已经结束，共一千零二十六个乡，第二批即将结束，共一千五百一十六个乡，第三批正在开始。西北地区，陕西省农民正组成小组进行讨论，或由读报组领导进行讨论。新疆省各族人民的讨论也正积极进行。中南地区有些地方今夏遭受水害，但许多地方仍然一面治水，一面坚持宪法草案的讨论。中国人民解放军和志愿军的广大指挥员和战斗员，也都积极参加了宪法草案的讨论。
    广大人民群众在讨论宪法草案中都表现了高度的政治热情。今夏各地多雨，人们常常冒雨赶往开会地点参加讨论。许多厂矿的职工为了讨论宪法草案，自愿地放弃了例假的休息时间。广东省江门市太平区居民梁小仪本来准备去广州看病，听说要讨论宪法草案，就暂时推迟了行期。各地书店、图书馆、文化站都准备了宪法草案单行本及有关宪法的各种资料。北京市各重要街道都设有宪法草案意见箱，便于人民随时随地提出意见。许多厂矿的技术人员，在工人进行讨论时担任了记录员，详细记下了工人们提出的修改意见。许多人在参加讨论之前做了细致的准备工作。广大机关干部除在规定的时间内进行集体学习和讨论外，许多人还抽出时间深入研究了宪法的许多资料和有关书籍，广大人民群众由于懂得了制定宪法的重大意义，因而在讨论中能够本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神，积极提出自己的修改意见，以使宪法更加完善。北京人民印刷厂工人讨论中，把大家在各项条文上发生争论的各种意见都详细记了下来，提交上级，大大鼓舞了群众讨论的热情和积极性。北京市面粉四厂工人在讨论中，特别关怀国家机关与人民群众的联系问题，因而在讨论宪法草案总纲第十七条时，有六个人提出了五条修改意见。北京十路公共汽车司机康志元原来认为宪法草案已经经过各方人士八千多人的讨论，自己很难再提出意见。但他又想到：只有在我们这样的民主国家，人民才有权利讨论宪法，为了把宪法制定得更完善，每一个公民都应该发挥自己的智慧，积极提出自己的意见，因此他用心研究了宪法草案的每一条文，在逐条讨论中，他对宪法草案的个别条文也提出了修改意见。北京师范大学教授罗志甫曾经参加过宪法草案初稿的讨论，并且提出过修改意见；宪法草案公布后，他把宪法草案和初稿作了比较，发现在不少地方都作了修改，他提出的意见有的也被采纳了。他亲身体会到了制定宪法的民主精神，在全校师生员工的讨论中，他更加积极地学习和提出意见。人民群众在讨论中一方面积极提出自己的各种意见，同时也反复推敲自己的意见是否完全正确。北京市私营新亚药厂工人黄永胜在第一次讨论会上曾提出一条修改意见，但会后他又觉得不十分恰当，在第二次讨论中，他又提出了第二种修改意见。在这一个时期的讨论中，人民群众以主人翁的态度对宪法草案提出了成千成万条意见。仅据北京市初步统计，截至八月三日为止，全市各界人民已提出两万四千多条意见。上海、沈阳、山西、陕西、哈尔滨、浙江、四川、旅大、济南、青岛等省市的初步统计，各界人民在讨论中共提出七千四百八十余条（有不少地区已把重复意见合并）。这些意见正逐级上报，最后提交宪法起草委员会。
    这一时期，全国县级人民代表大会除安徽省极少数县以外，都已召开会议，并讨论了宪法草案。浙江全省八十多个县市有一万七千多名代表参加了宪法草案的讨论，一般都讨论了两天。各地召开的人民代表大会会议，都做出了拥护宪法草案的决议，许多单位并订出了宣传宪法草案的计划，会后代表们积极向选民进行了宣传。最近各地已经召开或正在召开的省级人民代表大会会议，也认真讨论了宪法草案。
    各地宣传、讨论宪法草案，一般都紧密结合当地生产和中心工作进行。宪法草案的宣传和讨论活动不但没有影响生产和工作，并对生产和工作起了积极推动的作用。工矿企业单位结合生产宣传讨论宪法草案，主要是一方面要利用生产的空隙时间进行，另一方面是在宣传讨论中，要把宪法草案的内容和本单位的生产情况、职工思想情况有机地联系起来，使群众不但能够清楚地理解宪法草案的内容，且能进一步提高政治热情，更好地解决生产中存在的问题。河北省保定发电厂在向职工群众进行大规模宣传和组织讨论之前，曾召开宣传员会议，研究了厂内的生产情况和职工思想情况。当时这个厂正推行技术改革运动，有的工人认为发电厂已经电气化了，没有什么可以革新的，也有人好高鹜远，不注意从小处入手来革新。宣传员在宣传宪法草案的具体内容时，便联系本厂情况作了宣传讲解。如讲制定宪法的重大意义时，即结合解放前后厂内工人生活情况的对比加以说明；讲解总纲第一、第二条时，结合说明工人阶级的政治地位和工人在国家中应起的作用；讲人民代表大会制度时，结合讲解本厂选举代表出席市人民代表大会的事例；讲公民的基本权利和义务时，结合厂内工人劳动、休息以及发明创造受到国家表扬和奖励的情形；同时也结合批判了本厂工人在技术革新运动中的一些不正确思想，提出了“重点革新”、“集体创造”等口号，号召工人以实际行动来拥护宪法草案。经过这样宣传，工人的政治觉悟进一步提高，在生产中出现了大批的积极分子和技术革新的优秀人物。国营安东造纸厂第二车间报告员在向职工宣传宪法草案之前，也曾研究了当时生产中存在的主要问题，是产品质量低，劳动纪律松弛，部分技术人员和老工人不团结等；在宣传宪法草案时，除作了正面的引导启发，说明工人应如何加强团结，严格遵守劳动纪律，搞好生产，以便更好地发挥工人阶级的领导作用之外，同时并注意用表扬本厂模范人物的办法来教育职工群众。这个车间在宣传、讨论中，每一个阶段都及时研究了群众的思想情况和生产中的问题，及时结合宣传和群众的讨论加以解决，对生产的推动起了很大作用。在农村中，宪法草案的宣传讨论也与生产紧密结合。山西全省县以上的各级宪法草案讨论委员会和生产、互助合作、夏征、夏购等项工作的办公机构，都是在统一领导下分工负责和密切配合进行工作的。干部下乡都担负宣传宪法草案和完成中心工作的两重任务。雁北专区发生虫灾后，曾组织了四百八十余名干部分赴平鲁等八县，以扑灭虫灾为中心任务，同时展开了宪法草案的宣传和组织群众进行讨论。四川省宜宾市天池乡宪法草案宣传组和在这个乡帮助群众建立农业生产合作社的工作组，在工作中取得了密切联系，互相配合，使宪法草案宣传讨论和农业生产工作都取得很大成绩。他们采取了两种方法：一是共同安排宣传和开会的时间，一是在宣传内容和讨论内容上使两者结合起来。天池农业生产合作社建立之前，部分农民有顾虑，怕入社吃亏，宪法草案宣传组就根据群众的思想情况，着重讲解了宪法草案中关于国家鼓励和帮助农民走合作化道路的规定，并以本乡农业生产合作社的生产成绩作了对比说明。有的农民对当前国家鼓励初中和高小毕业生参加生产的政策不够了解，宪法宣传组就着重向农民讲解宪法草案中关于劳动光荣的规定，并使农民懂得文化教育事业必须在生产发展的基础上才能不断发展的道理。由于能够针对农民当前存在的思想问题进行宣传，宪法草案的宣传讨论活动和生产工作都得到很好的开展。据这乡两个村调查，百分之九十四的农户都懂得了宪法草案的主要内容，建立农业生产合作社的工作也得到很好的开展，农民并纷纷展开夏季积肥、除稗和治虫等工作，表示对宪法草案的拥护。
    宪法草案的宣传和讨论，直接鼓舞了广大劳动人民建设社会主义的热情，因而在全民讨论宪法草案过程中，工农业生产上出现了许多新的成就。各地工矿企业单位的技术革新运动在宪法草案讨论过程中得到进一步开展。重庆一零一钢铁厂工人在宪法草案讨论过程中，针对今年四月份以来生产计划完成不好的原因，展开了以“推广八大先进经验和试制两项新产品”为主要内容的技术革新运动。这个厂新建的炼钢车间的工人，通过宪法草案的讨论，提出很多生产建议，改变了出钢前后的混乱现象，使炼钢车间在七月三十日创造了新纪录，每炉冶炼时间由平均六小时缩短为五小时二十分。华东钢铁公司三厂铸造车间铸钢组技工姚荣祥在讨论宪法草案中，加强了国家主人翁的责任感，更加体会到在我们国家进行劳动的光荣，因而积极钻研，改进了钢锭模压铁浇铸法，工作效率提高了三倍。许多厂矿的职工通过宪法草案的讨论，更加自觉地遵守劳动纪律，加强了爱护公共财产的观念。哈尔滨电机厂修配车间车工李青山，六月份出过三十件废品，讨论宪法草案之后他作了自我检讨，保证遵守劳动纪律，不在生产时间说笑打闹，认真工作，保证消灭废品。一个月来，他没有出一件废品。农民通过宪法草案的讨论，更清楚地认识到互助合作是通向社会主义的大道。福建省永安县新桥乡营头村有十七户农民，在学习讨论宪法草案之后，积极要求参加互助组。这个乡有九个互助组积极创造条件，要争取今年建立生产合作社。河北省张家口郊区中榆林村十二个互助组农民讨论宪法草案之后，重新修订了夏锄计划。东榆林村佐文耀互助组提前锄完了七十八亩地，还帮助无劳动力的烈属、军属锄了十四亩地。定县祖村店乡往年征收农业税要三、四天才能完成，今年农民认识到依照法律纳税是公民应尽的义务，一天便完成任务，并全部入库。许多农民更积极支援国家工业建设，把大批余粮卖给了国家。陕西省汉中专区的农民王万兴、王立本还特地编了一首歌颂宪法草案的快板，表达他们的喜悦心情。快板中写道：宪法草案到农村，喜坏耕地人；白纸黑字条条显，国家权力属人民。工人大哥头前走，农民兄弟紧相跟；步步跟来步步紧，工厂多来粮满囤。
