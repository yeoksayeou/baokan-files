Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. On August 7th, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, wrote a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission replying to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission regarding the U.S. side's serious violations of the armistice agreement, adoption of terrorist and violent actions, endangering and threatening the safety of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel and their work in various parts of South Korea under its military control. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To: The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission

Military Armistice Commission received the letter from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission dated August 4, 1954.

Since its establishment, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has made positive contributions to supervising the implementation of the Korean armistice. Obviously, its existence and effective performance of its duties and tasks are very inconvenient for the United Nations Command side in illegally bringing in military reinforcements in violation of the armistice agreement. Therefore, its work in the areas controlled by the United Nations Command has been continuously restricted and obstructed since its beginning. Since July 31, 1954, a series of large-scale, planned terrorist and violent actions endangering and threatening the safety of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel and the work of the Commission have occurred continuously in the areas controlled by the United Nations Command, including firing shots and throwing bombs at the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel. The Korean-Chinese side is deeply indignant at this serious situation and expresses its condolences to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

The Korean-Chinese side believes that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's concern about the recent series of serious incidents in the areas controlled by the United Nations Command is fully justified. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's request that the United Nations Command side take full and effective measures to ensure the safety of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel and the normal work of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, and that the masterminds and murderers of each incident be punished, is entirely necessary. The Korean-Chinese side also believes that the Military Armistice Commission is the body for both sides signing the armistice agreement to supervise the implementation of the armistice and has the responsibility to handle this serious situation in a timely and conscientious manner. Therefore, at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side, the Military Armistice Commission held two consecutive meetings on August 3 and August 6, 1954, for this purpose.

At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on August 3, the Korean-Chinese side lodged a strong protest with the United Nations Command side regarding the above-mentioned series of serious violations of the armistice agreement by the United Nations Command side. The United Nations Command side stated that it acknowledged its responsibility to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and would provide full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation. But at the same time, actions openly threatening the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams were being carried out in Taegu, in the area controlled by the United Nations Command side. On August 3, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made remarks slandering and hostile to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, openly supporting those violent actions currently underway, and clamoring for the abolition of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The police authorities in the areas controlled by the United Nations Command side then openly threatened to take further persecutory actions against the personnel of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. And in its reply to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on August 4, the United Nations Command side did not make a clear and responsible statement on fulfilling all the obligations stipulated in the armistice agreement. This series of facts fully exposes that although the United Nations Command side acknowledges its responsibility to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and will fulfill it, it is only limited to empty talk and has not taken effective measures and practical actions to fulfill its responsibility, but in fact is continuing this threatening and violent behavior that violates the armistice agreement. Therefore, the Korean-Chinese side believes that the current situation is serious.

In order to enable the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to perform its duties and tasks, the Korean-Chinese side formally proposed at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on August 6 that the United Nations Command side should clearly guarantee to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that it would immediately take full and effective measures to stop the above-mentioned threatening and violent actions, ensure that such incidents would not occur again, severely punish the masterminds and murderers of each incident, and thoroughly implement all the clauses of the armistice agreement related to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Although these guarantees are completely legitimate and necessary, the United Nations Command side stubbornly refused to make responsible statements and clear guarantees. This attitude of the United Nations Command side further illustrates its attempt to continue this threatening and violent behavior, thereby undermining the clauses of the armistice agreement related to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, abolishing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, letting go of large-scale illegal entry of military reinforcements, deepening the instability of the Korean armistice, and creating tension in Asia. This is a planned action closely echoing the remarks of the U.S. Secretary of State on August 3.

The Korean-Chinese side believes that the clauses concerning the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are an inseparable part of the armistice agreement and must not be sabotaged in any way. The Korean-Chinese side is closely watching every step of the development of this serious situation, as well as how the United Nations Command side will put into practice the responsibilities that it acknowledges should be fulfilled in accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement. At the same time, the Korean-Chinese side reminds the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to be vigilant, to pay close attention to the United Nations Command side's attempt to continue this threatening and violent behavior in order to undermine the existence of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and hopes that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will notify the Military Armistice Commission of every new development of the relevant situation at any time.

    就美方在南朝鲜各地危害中立国视察人员的事件
    朝中方面首席委员复函中立国监察委员会
    【新华社开城七日电】八月七日，军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将，就美方在其军事控制下的南朝鲜各地严重违反停战协定、采取恐怖和暴力行动、危及并威胁中立国监察委员会人员的安全及其工作事，写信答复中立国监察委员会，这封信的全文如下：致：中立国监察委员会
    军事停战委员会收到了中立国监察委员会一九五四年八月四日的来信。
    中立国监察委员会成立以来，对于监督朝鲜停战的实施作了肯定的贡献。显然，它的存在和有效地执行其职司与任务，对于联合国军方面违反停战协定非法运进军事增援是很不方便的。因此，它在联合国军方面控制地区的工作自开始以来即不断遭遇到限制和阻挠。自一九五四年七月三十一日起，在联合国军方面控制地区竟连续发生大规模的、有计划的危害和威胁中立国监察委员会人员的安全及该委员会的工作的一系列的恐怖和暴力行动，包括向中立国监察委员会人员开枪射击和投掷炸弹。对于这种严重的情况，朝中方面深为愤慨，并向中立国监察委员会表示慰问。
    朝中方面认为，中立国监察委员会对于最近在联合国军方面控制地区内发生的一系列严重事件的关怀，是有其充分的理由的。中立国监察委员会要求联合国军方面采取充分有效的措施，保证中立国监察委员会人员的安全和中立国视察小组的正常工作，并要求惩罚各该事件的主谋和凶手，是完全必要的。朝中方面并认为，军事停战委员会是停战协定签字双方监督停战实施的机构，有责任及时地并认真地处理这一严重的情况。因此，在朝中方面建议之下，军事停战委员会曾在一九五四年八月三日和八月六日为此连续举行了两次会议。
    在八月三日的军事停战委员会的会议上，朝中方面就上述联合国军方面一系列的严重违反停战协定的事件，向联合国军方面提出了强硬的抗议。联合国军方面曾表示承认其对中立国监察委员会的责任，并将给予充分保护及一切可能的协助与合作。但与此同时，在联合国军方面控制地区的大邱却正在进行着对于中立国视察小组的公开威胁的行动。八月三日，美国国务卿杜勒斯发表诬蔑和敌视中立国监察委员会的谈话，公开支持目前正在进行着的那些暴力行动，叫嚣取消中立国监察委员会。联合国军方面控制地区的警察当局接着公开恫吓要对中立国视察小组人员采取进一步的迫害行动。而八月四日联合国军方面在其答复中立国监察委员会的信中也没有就履行停战协定所规定的全部义务作明确负责的表示。这一系列的事实充分暴露了：联合国军方面虽然承认其对于中立国监察委员会的责任并将予以履行，但只是限于空谈，并未采取有效措施和实际行动来履行其责任，而事实上则正在继续这种违反停战协定的威胁和暴力行为。因此，朝中方面认为目前的情况是严重的。
    为了使中立国监察委员会能够执行其职司与任务，朝中方面在八月六日的军事停战委员会的会议上正式提出：联合国军方面应该向中立国监察委员会明确保证立即采取充分有效的措施停止上述的威胁和暴力行动，保证此类事件不再发生，严惩各该事件的主谋与凶手，和彻底执行停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的全部条款。虽然这些保证都是完全正当而且必要的，但是联合国军方面固执地始终拒绝作负责的表示和明确的保证。联合国军方面的这种态度，进一步说明了它企图继续这种威胁和暴力行为，借此破坏停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的条款，取消中立国监察委员会，放手大量非法运进军事增援，加深朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，制造亚洲紧张局势。这是和美国国务卿八月三日的谈话紧密地互相呼应的有计划的行动。
    朝中方面认为，有关中立国监察委员会各条款是停战协定中的不可分割的部分，绝不容许任何破坏。朝中方面正在密切注视这一严重事态的每一步的发展，以及联合国军方面如何将其所承认的按照停战协定的规定应予履行的责任付诸实行。朝中方面同时提起中立国监察委员会的警惕，应密切注意联合国军方面企图继续这种威胁和暴力行为，以破坏中立国监察委员会的存在，并希望中立国监察委员会随时将有关情况的每一新的发展通知军事停战委员会。
