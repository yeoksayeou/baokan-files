    Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: Some economic figures recently revealed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's newspapers show that the United States has, in recent years, controlled Taiwan's economic lifeline through so-called "economic aid," completely turning Taiwan's economy into a colony.
    The United States controls Taiwan's industry, mining, and agriculture through so-called "industrial aid" and "technical aid." According to apparently incomplete figures revealed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit newspapers, from June 1950 to June 1954, the United States' direct investment in Taiwan under the guise of "industrial aid" and "technical aid" reached over 91.8 million US dollars. The scope of investment includes electricity, petroleum, coal mines, shipbuilding, papermaking, chemical fertilizers, light industry, and the exploration of mineral deposits, fisheries, and forestry throughout Taiwan. Reports indicate that the United States plans to continue investing 56.1 million US dollars through this "aid" method in the 1954-1955 fiscal year. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has recently passed the so-called "Foreign Investment Regulations" under the orders of its American masters, opening the door wide for large-scale intrusion of American monopoly capital into Taiwan.
    Under the guise of "material aid," the United States also dumps large quantities of unsalable goods onto the Taiwan market, monopolizing the Taiwan market. According to figures revealed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's newspapers, from 1950 to June 1954, the value of goods dumped by the United States in Taiwan through "material aid" reached over 290 million US dollars, equivalent to more than 65% of Taiwan's foreign exchange settlement amount during this period. This dumping is increasing year by year. In 1950, the total value of goods dumped by the United States in Taiwan was equivalent to 22.3% of Taiwan's foreign exchange settlement amount, increasing to 67.2% in 1951, 80.4% in 1952, and further increasing to 82.9% in 1953.
    To further control Taiwan's economic lifeline, the US Foreign Operations Administration's Taiwan branch reorganized in early March this year, adding three assistant directors in charge of planning, industry, and economic affairs. The branch director, Brent, openly admitted in early April this year that the United States would be "more active" in controlling Taiwan's industry and resource development through "aid" in the future. According to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit newspapers, one of the important tasks of the American "economic advisory group" that recently went to Taiwan to carry out conspiratorial activities is to pave the way for further intrusion and control of Taiwan's economic lifeline by American monopoly capital.

    美国通过“经济援助”控制台湾的经济命脉
    【新华社二十一日讯】从蒋匪帮报纸最近透露的某些经济方面的数字可以看出，美国在最近几年来通过所谓“经济援助”，已控制了台湾的经济命脉，使台湾的经济完全殖民地化。
    美国通过所谓“工业援助”和“技术援助”控制了台湾的工矿业和农业。仅据蒋匪报纸透露的显然不完全的数字，从一九五零年六月到一九五四年六月的四年中，美国在“工业援助”和“技术援助”的名义下对台湾的直接投资，已达九千一百八十余万美元。投资的范围包括电力、石油、煤矿、造船、造纸、化学肥料、轻工业和全台湾的矿藏探勘、渔业和林业等等。有消息说，在一九五四到一九五五年度内，美国还准备通过这种“援助”的方式，继续投入五千六百一十万美元的资本。蒋介石卖国集团已在最近奉美国主子的命令通过了所谓
  “外国人投资条例”，为美国垄断资本大规模地侵入台湾，大开方便之门。
    美国还在“物资援助”的名义下，把大量没有销路的商品向台湾市场倾销，垄断了台湾市场。据蒋匪帮报纸透露的数字，从一九五零年到一九五四年六月这段期间，美国以“物资援助”方式在台湾倾销的商品即达两亿九千余万美元，相当于台湾这个时期进口结汇额的百分之六十五以上。这种倾销是逐年增加的。一九五零年美国向台湾倾销的商品总值相当于台湾进口结汇额的百分之二十二点三，一九五一年增加到百分之六十七点二，一九五二年增加到百分之八十点四，一九五三年更增加到百分之八十二点九。
    为了进一步控制台湾的经济命脉，美国援外事务管理署驻台湾分署曾在今年三月初进行了改组，增加了三个分别掌握企划、工业、经济三项业务的助理署长。该分署署长布伦特在今年四月初公开承认，美国今后通过“援助”方式来控制台湾的工业和资源开发“将更趋积极”。据蒋匪报纸透露，最近到台湾去进行阴谋活动的美国“经济顾问团”的重要任务之一，就是替美国垄断资本进一步侵入并控制台湾的经济命脉铺平道路。
