Since the beginning of the flood season, hundreds of thousands of civilian laborers and cadres along the Huai River, under the leadership of the CCP committees and the people's government, have been working day and night to resist the waves, carry out emergency rescue, and reinforce the dikes, engaging in a tenacious struggle against the floodwaters.

In the Lu'an Special District of Anhui, more than 5,300 cadres and over 298,000 civilian laborers are intensely engaged in dike protection, flood prevention, and drainage of accumulated water along the main and tributary streams of the Huai River. The secretary of the CCP District Committee and the commissioner of the Special District have also gone deep into the key and dangerous counties and sections to provide specific leadership. Cooperatives and warehouses in Lu'an County are promptly supplying all the equipment needed for flood prevention and drainage. The Suxian Special District has organized over 110,000 civilian laborers, from the Wo River east of Huaiyuan County and north of the Huai River to the Yao River Dam in Sihong County, to begin internal slope reinforcement and dike top reinforcement projects in dangerous sections, with a total earthwork task of over 2 million cubic meters.

Huainan City has also mobilized a large number of cadres to participate in flood prevention, and has transferred in more than 10,000 wooden piles and a large number of burlap sacks and straw bales for flood prevention materials. In order to consolidate the Laoying section of the Huainan dike, the city has added a one-meter-high subsidiary dike on the old dike and placed soil bags on the outer slope for slope protection. The Bengbu City Flood Control Headquarters has also vigorously strengthened flood control work. The city's highest historical flood level was 21.19 meters, but on July 31, it rose to 22.09 meters, exceeding it by 0.9 meters. However, due to the heightening and reinforcement of the enclosure dikes, it is still safe.

During flood prevention and emergency rescue along the Huai River, many model individuals have emerged. Ma Xiuying, deputy head of Yangtaizi Township in the Menghe Depression Flood Storage Area of Funan County, searched for boats everywhere in the rain, despite being ill, to help the masses relocate when the floodwaters rose. When Lingtai Dam exceeded the guaranteed water level and a breach was discovered, under the leadership of Communist Party member Wu Baoshan, a group of civilian laborers used their bodies to block the floodwaters, while another group of civilian laborers carried out rescue efforts, finally ensuring the safety of the dam.

    淮河沿岸广大民工紧张防汛抢险
    自进入汛期以来，沿淮数十万民工和干部在中共党委和人民政府的领导下，不分日夜地挡浪抢险，加固堤防，和洪水作顽强的斗争。
    安徽六安专区淮河干支流有干部五千三百多名，民工二十九万八千多人，紧张进行护堤防汛和排除积水。中共地委书记和专区专员也都深入各险要县段，具体领导。六安县合作社、仓库等部门都及时供应防汛和排涝应用的一切器材。宿县专区组织了十一万多民工，从怀远县涡河以东、淮河以北直到泗洪县的窑河大坝，开始进行内坡帮戗和险工地段的堤顶加固工程，土方任务共有二百多万公方。
    淮南市也动员了大批干部参加防汛，调来一万多根木桩和大批麻袋草包等防汛物资。为巩固淮南老鹰段堤防，该市已在老堤上加筑了一道一公尺高的子埝，并在外坡放置护坡的土袋。蚌埠市防汛指挥部也大力加强防汛工作。该市历年最高洪水位为二一·一九公尺，七月三十一日已涨达二二·○九公尺，超过了○·九公尺，但由于将围堤进行了加高加固工程，仍确保无恙。
    淮河沿岸各地在防汛抢险中，出现了许多模范人物。阜南县濛河洼地蓄洪区杨台子乡副乡长马秀英，在洪水上涨时，抱病冒雨到处找寻船只，帮助群众转移。灵台坝超过了保证水位时，发现决口，在共产党员吴宝善带领下，一部分民工用身体拦阻洪水，另一部分民工进行抢救，终于确保了堤坝的安全。
