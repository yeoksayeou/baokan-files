Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, August 11th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, August 10th, at noon on August 3rd, the French Federal Forces completely withdrew from Fuan City, northwest of Hanoi. Subsequently, Vietnamese People's Army troops and the People's Administrative Committee immediately entered Fuan.

Tens of thousands of people gathered at the city gate to welcome the Vietnamese People's Army and government representatives, after which they formed an enthusiastic rally. Government personnel announced on the spot the eight policies and regulations of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the newly liberated areas, and the ten disciplines to be observed by cadres, army personnel, and government personnel. The people listened enthusiastically, and many were moved to tears.

The liberated Fuan City is full of vitality. The golden-starred red flag flies in the streets, shops are open all day, and the city is especially lively at night. Young children held the hands of People's Army soldiers, asking them to teach new songs, while adults gathered together to listen to President Ho Chi Minh's message on the restoration of peace in Indochina.

After learning about the lenient policies of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, counter-revolutionaries have been continuously coming out to surrender to the People's Administrative Committee.

Fuan was a city with dirty streets when the French troops withdrew. After liberation, residents assisted the People's Army in disinfecting the entire city, and the whole city is now cleaner than ever before.

Many residents have already made plans to repair their houses, reorganize their businesses, and prepare to build a new life. Many families who moved to other places have returned.

In Fuan, peace has been restored, and the people live and work in peace. An 86-year-old woman said to her neighbors: Only now am I living a real life.

Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, August 11th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, August 10th, the Saigon-Cholon branch of the Vietnam National United Front wrote to President Ho Chi Minh, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, saying that the tens of thousands of northern Vietnamese residents who were deceived and forcibly relocated to the south by the Ngo Dinh Diem group are living miserable lives.

The letter said that after these people were abducted to the southern region, they did not have adequate housing and food. Many people are forced to do hard labor on rubber plantations in Thu Dau Mot and Tay Ninh provinces in South Vietnam. Many people are forced to sell their children due to the necessities of life, while reactionaries are taking advantage of the situation to make a fortune. They often engage in the trafficking of children from North Vietnam.

The letter concluded by stating that the Vietnamese people in the south guarantee to correctly implement President Ho Chi Minh's instructions and will continue to struggle to urge the French government to earnestly implement the terms of the armistice agreement and maintain a high degree of vigilance against all conspiracies to undermine peace by imperialist warmongers and their lackeys.

    越南福安城人民欢庆解放准备建立新生活
    被劫运到南部的北越居民生活悲惨被迫卖儿女
   【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社北越十日讯：八月三日中午，法兰西联邦部队完全撤出河内西北的福安城。接着，越南人民军部队和人民行政委员会立即进入了福安。
    成千上万的人聚集在城门口欢迎越南人民军和政府代表，随后他们就形成了一个热情洋溢的大会。人民政府人员当场宣布了越南民主共和国政府对新解放地区的八项政策和规定要干部、军队人员和政府人员遵守的十项纪律。人民热情地听着，许多人感动得泪水盈眶。
    解放后的福安城充满生气。金星红旗飘扬在街道上，商店都全天营业，到夜晚格外热闹。幼童们拉着人民军战士的手，要他们教新歌，成年人则聚到一起倾听胡志明主席就恢复印度支那和平问题发表的文告。
    在得知越南民主共和国政府的宽大政策后，反革命分子不断出来向人民行政委员会自首。
    法军部队撤退时的福安是一个街道肮脏的城市。解放后，居民协助人民军在全城消毒，目前全城空前清洁。
    许多居民已经都订了计划来修理他们的房屋，整理他们的营业，准备建立新的生活。许多搬到其他地方去的人家都已回来了。
    在福安，和平已经恢复，人民都安居乐业。有一位八十六岁的老太太对她的邻居说：只有在现在，我才过着真正的生活。
   【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社北越十日讯：越南国民联合战线西贡堤岸支部写信给胡志明主席、越南民主共和国政府和越南国民联合战线全国委员会说，被吴庭艳集团欺骗和强迫迁移到南部去的成千上万的北越居民，正过着悲惨的生活。
    信上说，那些人被劫运到南部地区后，没有适当的住所和饮食。许多人被迫在南越的土龙木和西宁省的橡胶园做苦工，许多人为生活所迫不得不把自己的儿女卖掉，而反动分子们却乘人之危大发横财，他们经常做着贩卖从北越来的儿童的勾当。
    这封信最后写道，南部的越南人民保证正确执行胡志明主席的指示，将继续斗争，以敦促法国政府认真执行停战协定的条款，并对帝国主义战争贩子和他们的走狗进行的破坏和平的一切阴谋保持高度的警惕。
