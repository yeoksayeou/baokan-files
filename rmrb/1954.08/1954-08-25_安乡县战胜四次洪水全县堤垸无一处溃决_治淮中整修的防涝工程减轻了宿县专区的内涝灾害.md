Anxiang County in Hunan Province, under the leadership of the Party and government organs, has led the people of the county to continuously overcome four floods in more than two months, ensuring that no dikes in the entire county breached.

Anxiang County is located in the northern part of Hunan Province, bordering rivers and lakes, with intertwined waterways and dense harbors and streams. The safety of the 270,000 people and more than 700,000 mu of farmland in the county depends entirely on twenty-four polders. Since liberation, the Party and the People's Government have led the masses to continuously strengthen the embankments and resist floods, achieving a victory of not breaching a single polder for four years. This summer, the county suffered unprecedented floods, especially the third and fourth flood peaks, which exceeded the historical water levels by five to nine centimeters. In many sections, the water surface was level with the riverbank, relying only on secondary dikes to block the water, with the risk of overflow at any time. However, the people of the county were determined to overcome the flood. They transported more than 200,000 cubic meters of soil and repaired more than 260,000 meters of secondary dikes. In flood prevention and rescue, the people of Anxiang fully demonstrated their heroic and tenacious spirit of overcoming the flood together. In July, 153 meters of the dike surface at Wu's Terrace in Anhua Polder collapsed by two-thirds, threatening to breach the polder. The County Flood Control Headquarters immediately notified various places to send reinforcements. Two hours later, two thousand rescuers appeared on about two thousand meters of the dike, and a large number of materials were transported in. A new dike was quickly built, stone revetments were constructed, and wood was driven into the mud to form more than three thousand meters of tree walls to support the dike body and prevent slippage. Since June, more than 1,800 large and small dangerous works have been rescued, ensuring that no polder has breached in the county.

The flood prevention projects repaired in the Huai River management over the past few years have greatly reduced the waterlogging disaster in Suxian Prefecture, Anhui Province. Suxian Prefecture has always been the most severely waterlogged area. Although the rainfall was very high this year, the area affected by waterlogging has been greatly reduced due to the effectiveness of the drainage projects, and the accumulated water in some waterlogged fields has also receded quickly. Before the Su River was dredged, the narrow drainage channels caused flooding whenever rainfall was concentrated. In July 1950, the waterlogged area on both sides of the Su River reached 2,000 square kilometers, with an average water depth of half a meter to one meter, and the water in the low-lying areas accumulated for more than a month. Due to the dredging of the Su River and the treatment of the Tang River and the Xin River, the accumulated water had a way out. Although the rainfall this year exceeded that of 1931 and 1950, the banks of the Su River were not flooded. On July 16, the rainfall was 200 mm, and some low-lying areas only accumulated water for one day; even Yangding Lake, which has the lowest terrain and has not harvested in nine out of ten years in the past, was not waterlogged this year because the Yan River was dredged this year.

After the completion of the Huai River trunk and tributary diversion project below Wuhe County, since the flood season, although the water level of the trunk stream has exceeded or approached the highest water level in previous years, the water level of the tributary streams is still lower than the trunk stream, ensuring the safety of one million mu of farmland.

    安乡县战胜四次洪水全县堤垸无一处溃决
    治淮中整修的防涝工程减轻了宿县专区的内涝灾害
    湖南安乡县党政机关领导全县人民，两个多月以来连续战胜四次洪水，保卫了全县堤垸无一处溃决。
    安乡县位于湖南省北部，临江滨湖，境内水道交织，港汶密布，全靠二十四个垸子保卫着全县二十七万人民和七十万余亩田地安全。解放以来，党和人民政府领导群众不断加固堤防，抗拒洪水，已取得了四年未溃一垸的胜利。今年夏季，全县遭受了数十年来未有的洪水袭击，特别是三、四次洪峰都超过历年水位五至九公寸，不少堤段水面已与河堤相平，仅靠子堤挡水，随时都有漫溢的危险。但全县人民决心战胜洪水，他们前后共挑土二十余万方，抢修了二十六万多公尺长的子堤。在防洪抢险中，安乡人民充分表现了英勇顽强共同战胜洪水的精神。七月间，安化垸吴家台一百五十三公尺长堤段外崩了三分之二的堤面，眼看就要溃垸。县防汛指挥部立即通知各地增援，两小时后，在约两千公尺堤段上出现了两千名抢险人员，并运到大批器材，很快就筑起新堤，修起石岸，并把木头打入泥中，编成三千多公尺长的树墙，顶住堤身，防止下挫。从六月份以来，共已抢救大小险工一千八百多处，保证了全县未溃一垸。　　　　（刘杰士）

    几年来治淮中整修的防涝工程，大大减轻了安徽省宿县专区的内涝灾害。宿县专区历来是最严重的内涝地区，今年虽然雨量很大，但因排涝工程起了作用，受涝面积却大大缩小，部分受涝的田亩积水也退得很快。濉河未疏浚前，因排水道狭小，雨量稍一集中即造成水灾。一九五○年七月，濉河两岸内涝面积达两千平方公里，积水一般有半公尺至一公尺深，洼地积水有一个多月。由于疏浚了濉河，治理了唐河、新河，使积水有了出路，今年雨量虽然超过一九三一年和一九五○年，濉河两岸也没有遭淹。七月十六日降雨二百公厘，部分洼地仅积水一天；就连地势最低、以往十年九不收的杨町湖，也因今年疏浚了阎河，没有受涝。
    五河县以下的淮河干支分流工程完工后，汛期以来，干流水位虽已超过或接近历年最高水位，支流水位仍低于干流，保障了一百万亩农田的安全。
