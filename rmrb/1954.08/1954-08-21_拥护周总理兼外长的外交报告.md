China Democratic National Construction Association Chairman Zhang Bojun's Talk

Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee analyzed the significant achievements of the Geneva Conference, explained China's current peaceful diplomatic policy, and called on the people of the whole country to "struggle to the end to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan and defending world peace." This expresses the common aspirations and guiding principles of the 600 million Chinese people. I, on behalf of all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association, express warm support. We also extend our highest respect to the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou for its outstanding contributions at the Geneva Conference.

The significant achievements of the Geneva Conference show that the reactionary policy of the American aggressive bloc has suffered a shameful defeat, and the American aggressive bloc is becoming increasingly isolated in the eyes of the world. The Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, advocated by our country, have become the common demands of the people all over the world. In order to continue to implement our country's peaceful diplomatic policy, develop our country's cooperative relations with various countries in the world, and ensure Asian and world peace and security, we resolutely respond to the government's call and strive to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to the end.

Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory. The "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation" both clearly stipulate that Taiwan belongs to China. The Chinese people have never forgotten that they must liberate Taiwan. The United States' occupation of Taiwan violates international agreements and undermines China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The United States occupies Taiwan as a military base in order to fulfill its dreams of invading our country, annexing Asia, and dominating the world. Therefore, liberating Taiwan is a part of the Chinese people's liberation cause, and it is also a part of our country's cause of defending world peace. Chiang Kai-shek is a public enemy of the people and a traitor to the nation. He is the executioner who brutally murdered Taiwanese compatriots in the "February 28th" incident. Since being driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people, he and his remaining bandits have occupied Taiwan, exploited the blood and sweat of Taiwanese compatriots, and colluded with the American aggressive bloc to carry out shameless traitorous activities. Recently, relying on the protection of the American naval and air forces, they have harassed and sabotaged our coastal areas, airdropped special agents, plundered overseas Chinese property, looted coastal fishermen, and murdered compatriots. They have even engaged in piracy by intercepting and detaining ships from various countries coming to China for trade, creating international tensions, increasing the threat of war, and preventing our country and other relevant countries from sharing the benefits of peace. These heinous crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are intolerable not only to the Chinese people, but also to the people of the world.

We firmly support the government's repeated declaration: "Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory, which will never be allowed to be occupied by the United States, nor will it be allowed to be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations." Liberating Taiwan is our country's sovereignty and internal affair, and no other country is allowed to interfere. The American aggressive bloc has no right to obstruct or interfere. If the United States dares to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, it must bear all the serious consequences of its aggressive crimes.

In order to restore our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in order to ensure peace and security in Asia and the world, we call on all party members to unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strengthen ideological remolding, work hard to carry out propaganda work, heighten vigilance, overcome difficulties, especially the organizations and members of our party in coastal provinces, should strengthen preparations to support the work of the People's Liberation Army, contribute all their strength, and strive to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan, eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and defending Asian and world peace to the end.

China Zhi Gong Party Chairman Chen Qiyou's Talk

We wholeheartedly support Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on August 11, the various agreements reached at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina, and Premier Zhou's diplomatic activities during the conference and on his visits to various countries on his return trip; we support the joint statements issued by Premier Zhou with the Prime Ministers of India and Burma, and the communiqu√© of the talks with the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Germany; we support our country's support for all Soviet proposals related to European peace; and finally, we support the national policy of resolutely liberating Taiwan.

Although American imperialism sabotaged the solution to the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, it did not succeed in obstructing and sabotaging the achievement of the Indochina armistice agreement. At present, in addition to stepping up the formation of various Pacific anti-communist alliances in the name of joint defense, encircling our country, stepping up the arming of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and instigating Chiang's bandits to disturb our mainland, it is also directly provoking us and creating the Hainan Island incident. All its crimes are nothing more than to maintain tension in Asia in order to achieve its ambitions of invading China, invading Asia, and dominating the world. If Taiwan is not liberated, not only will the people of our country not be able to live and work in peace and contentment, but peace in Asia and even the world will be threatened. Therefore, liberating Taiwan is not only an action that should be taken to realize the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, but also a step that must be taken to defend peace in Asia and the world!

Taiwan has been our country's territory since ancient times, and American imperialism will never be allowed to occupy it, nor will it be allowed to be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations. Liberating Taiwan is our country's internal affair, and no foreign country is allowed to interfere. However, the American aggressive bloc has the audacity to openly declare that it will prevent us from liberating Taiwan, which is something we absolutely cannot tolerate! With unparalleled determination and confidence, the people of our country must liberate Taiwan and complete the entire liberation cause. We will not stop until we achieve our goal!

Under the leadership of the great and correct Chinese Communist Party and the wise Chairman Mao, our country has become an unprecedentedly powerful country, and recently achieved a great diplomatic victory at the Geneva Conference. In addition, we have the People's Liberation Army, which has been tempered into steel, and the unity of the people of the whole country. We are fully confident of liberating Taiwan. We believe that the Taiwanese compatriots who are in deep water and fire will also take coordinated actions for their own liberation. The military and political personnel who have been deceived and oppressed by Chiang Kai-shek, as long as they realize that they are Chinese, understand all the achievements of the motherland, and are unwilling to be the tools of Chiang Kai-shek, the American aggressive bloc's running dogs, they will also abandon the dark and come over to the light, and rise up to return to the fold.

The Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou did a great job at the Geneva Conference and made great contributions. We pay our highest respect to Premier Zhou and the delegation, and we are willing to do everything in our power to liberate Taiwan and realize peace in Asia and the world.

All-China Students' Federation Vice Chairman Guan Ruoluan's Talk

Chinese students fully agree with the diplomatic report made by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. We wholeheartedly support and support the peaceful diplomatic policy of our government, and warmly celebrate the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou at the Geneva Conference and in extensive friendly visits. We resolutely respond to the call of the Central People's Government to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in order to finally complete the sacred liberation cause of the Chinese people.

Chinese students clearly know that American imperialism is definitely not willing to accept its failure. It still stubbornly implements the aggressive policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, creating international tensions, stubbornly obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, attempting to undermine the implementation of various agreements on restoring peace in Indochina, and plotting to piece together the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group" and "Northeast Asia Defense League" with China as the main target of opposition. At the same time, it continues to occupy our Taiwan, plans to sign a so-called "bilateral common security treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and intensifies its instigation and assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out harassment and destructive wars against the Chinese mainland and coastal areas, attempting to restore Chiang Kai-shek, a handful of dregs of humanity, in China and turn the entire China into a colony of the United States. Chinese students will never tolerate this barbaric act of aggression by American imperialism.

Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan is the glorious historical task of the Chinese people and the sacred responsibility of Chinese students. Chinese students deeply know that only by liberating Taiwan from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique supported by American imperialism can the complete unification of our great motherland be realized, the Chinese people's liberation cause can be completely victorious, and the peace of the Far East and the world can be effectively guaranteed. Students across the country infinitely sympathize with and care about the Taiwanese compatriots who are under the fascist rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The crimes and blood debts of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in expelling and arresting a large number of Taiwanese students, forcing them to serve as cannon fodder, and carrying out killings and various persecutions against them must be settled. Taiwanese students and Taiwanese compatriots are still living in a painful life of deep water and fire, which Chinese students consider to be their own shame. Chinese students with a patriotic tradition will study and exercise more diligently, respond to the call of the motherland at any time, and be prepared to contribute all their strength to defend and build the motherland and liberate Taiwan. We hope that Taiwanese students will hold high the glorious banner of patriotic liberation, unite more closely, and, together with the people of Taiwan, continue to resolutely launch a heroic struggle against American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and actively prepare to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan with practical actions. Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we firmly believe that Taiwanese students and Taiwanese compatriots will inevitably return to the embrace of the motherland, and victory will surely belong to the righteous people of the motherland.

China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Chairman Guo Moruo's Talk

The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, on behalf of all Chinese literary and art workers, warmly expresses: We fully support Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report and the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on August 11.

In his report, Premier Zhou expounded extremely incisively on the achievements of the Geneva Conference and the achievements of our country's peaceful diplomacy. All these achievements prove the further growth of world peace forces and the increasing weakening of aggressive forces; proving that a policy of peace will surely defeat a policy of aggression. The People's Republic of China has become a great force for ensuring peace and security in Asia and the world, and its important position and great role in international affairs are becoming increasingly prominent. The tasks of the Chinese people in the future, as Premier Zhou pointed out, are to work hard with relevant countries to jointly ensure the thorough implementation of the various agreements on restoring peace in Indochina reached at the Geneva Conference, and to continue to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue; to consolidate and develop our country's peaceful and cooperative relations with various countries in accordance with the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, and to strive to establish collective peace in Asia.

In his report, Premier Zhou mentioned another important task of ours at present, which is to liberate Taiwan and safeguard the integrity of our country's sovereignty and territory. Taiwan is part of our country's sacred and inviolable territory. Since Taiwan was forcibly occupied by Japanese imperialism in 1895, the Chinese people living in Taiwan and the Chinese people living on the mainland have waged a long-term struggle to liberate Taiwan from the enslavement of Japanese aggressors. Finally, in the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Taiwan was recovered. However, after the Chinese people achieved the great victory of the People's Liberation War, the American aggressive bloc first sheltered the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who fled to Taiwan, and then openly occupied Taiwan, replacing Japanese imperialism in enslaving our Taiwanese compatriots, and actively supported Chiang's bandits, attempting to use this small group of traitorous groups to further invade our country and undermine peace in Asia. The Chinese people across the country cannot tolerate this heinous crime of the American aggressive bloc. Recently, due to the armistice in Korea and the restoration of peace in Indochina, the tense situation in Asia has gradually eased. The American aggressive bloc has further used the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out harassment and destructive wars against our mainland and coastal areas in order to expand its aggressive actions. This is a further provocation and threat to our People's Republic of China, and it is also a further provocation and threat to peace in Asia and world peace. In order to safeguard the integrity of our country's sovereignty and territory, and in order to defend peace and security in Asia and the world, we must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is the struggle to defend world peace. All of us literary and art workers resolutely respond to the call of the Central People's Government Committee, stand at our posts, work hard to strengthen our work, strive to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, so as to complete the sacred liberation cause of our Chinese people, and make unremitting struggles to defend peace in Asia and the world!

China Association for Science and Technology Chairman Li Siguang's Talk

Premier Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee comprehensively explained how China made tremendous contributions to the cause of defending world peace in diplomacy during the Geneva Conference; at the same time, it also pointed out that in order to implement the policy of peace, we must resolutely complete the final glorious task in the great cause of liberating the whole country‚Äîliberating Taiwan. I, on behalf of the China Association for Science and Technology, express warm support for this historically significant report.

Thanks to the achievements of the Geneva Conference, the Vietnamese people, who fought bravely against the colonial war, have achieved a comprehensive ceasefire for the first time for more than eight years on the basis of the independence and autonomy requirements of various countries in Indochina. Thanks to the achievements of the Geneva Conference, the peace forces, which have rapidly grown stronger, have prevented the war-mongers from expanding the war plot, thereby easing international tensions. Under such significant pressure, even the American delegation had to submit a guarantee in the form of a written confession that "the United States will not use threats or force to harm these agreements and clauses." We congratulate the people of Indochina and rejoice for the people around the world who are striving for independence and loving peace. This is the great achievement of the first great power conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China, and we are proud of this.

During the Geneva Conference, due to the great role played by Premier Zhou on behalf of our Central People's Government, the achievements outside the meeting were no less than the agreements reached at the meeting. The achievements in this regard are specifically reflected in the joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India, and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, as well as the communiqu√©s of the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and Germany. From then on, we have established the broadest, most reasonable, and most in line with the current international situation, the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence for adjusting international relations; for the issue of European peace, we have also accurately pointed out the key. All these achievements clearly show that it is a further development of the peaceful policy of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, that is, it provides practical norms for the specific ways of handling international disputes in the spirit of consultation.

However, the American war bloc, which has consistently attempted to undermine world peace, is unwilling to accept defeat. As is well known, before the ink was dry on the statement signed by the American representative stating that it would not use force to hinder the Indochina armistice agreement, they were doing everything possible to undermine the Korean armistice agreement, and were still engaged in the so-called "Southeast Asia" and even the "Northeast Asia," which has never been heard of in geography, so-called defense groups that many discerning Asian countries have ignored, aiming at aggression against China. In particular, recently, they have been providing a large amount of manpower and material resources to the Chiang Kai-shek remnants in Taiwan, who have been spurned by the Chinese people, and have instigated them to carry out armed harassment in the southeastern region of the motherland and pirate-style looting of foreign merchant ships coming to our country for peaceful trade. Under the instigation of American war-mongers, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has even unscrupulously continued to clamor to expand the scope of the war and expect the flames of the Third World War to be ignited sooner or later. The existence of this war threat, especially within Chinese territory, is something that the Chinese people can never tolerate. It is also something that peace-loving people all over the world cannot ignore.

Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times. The compatriots in Taiwan, like the compatriots in other provinces of the motherland, are all Chinese people. The criminal fact that this territory of the motherland was forcibly occupied by Japanese militarists from 1895 to 1945 fueled the ambitions of the aggressors and allowed them to expand the scope of aggression, resulting in increasingly tense Sino-Japanese relations and the Asian situation for half a century, which ultimately led to the rampage of Japanese militarists to launch a frenzied attack on the entire Asia and even Australia, which was one of the main reasons for undermining world peace. The Chinese people's decades of struggle experience and bloody lessons make us never allow such a criminal history to repeat itself, and never allow our territory of Taiwan to fall into the hands of any aggressive group again, so that they can use it as a base for attacking the mainland of the motherland or any Asian country. The Chinese people will also never allow any foreign group to use the fact that a small group of traitorous groups, who are sheltered and fostered by them and spurned by the people of the whole country, are temporarily entrenched on the territory of the motherland, and forcibly insert their representatives into the United Nations, usurping the legal status of the People's Republic of China, and excluding the role that the People's Republic of China should and can play in the international family for the benefit of international peace.

It must be pointed out that punishing the Chiang Kai-shek traitor within the territory of our country is entirely our internal affair and sovereignty, which no one is allowed to interfere with. Regarding this point, Mr. Attlee, who recently visited China, said well: If any country other than the United States supported Bugoni and established a rebel base in Long Island to launch armed attacks on other parts of the United States of America, how would the American government and people treat it?

Therefore, in order to realize a sacred clause of the draft constitution recently formulated by our people themselves‚Äîto ensure the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, for the security of the motherland, and for peace in Asia and the world, our national scientific workers must stand with the people of the whole country, respond to the call of our Central People's Government, and resolutely contribute all our strength to the glorious task of liberating Taiwan through our respective posts. We do not have any‰æ•Âπ∏ ÂøÉÊÄù, nor do we underestimate certain technical difficulties. But we firmly believe that with the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the incomparably strong forces formed by the unity of the people of the whole country, and with the support of all peace-loving and justice-upholding people and governments in the world, this source of war and threat to peace can be completely eradicated. Glory belongs to the people of the motherland. With the eradication of this source of trouble, the cause of peace in Asia and the world can be further guaranteed.

China Islamic Cultural Association Deputy Director Bai Shouyi's Talk

Premier Zhou's recent diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee specifically analyzed the achievements of the Geneva Conference for the cause of peace, profoundly exposed the American aggressive group's conspiracy to undermine peace and consistently oppose the Chinese people, and clearly pointed out the important tasks of the Chinese people in the current international environment. The Chinese Hui people fully agree with and sincerely support this report, and are proud of the profound growth of the strength of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong for Premier Zhou's outstanding contributions in the Geneva Conference process.

Since the day our People's Republic of China was established, the American aggressive group has been trying every possible means to conspire to undermine the People's Republic of China. It launched the Korean War of aggression, intensified its interference in the Indochina War, and sent a fleet to invade our Taiwan Strait. Not long ago, its conspiracy in Korea failed. Due to the success of the Geneva Conference, its conspiracy in Indochina also failed. But it is not reconciled to its failure, but intensifies its instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group entrenched in Taiwan to carry out increasingly rampant harassment and destructive activities against our southeastern coastal areas and islands, plundering people's property, luring young people, and looting merchant ships. The American aggressive group's aggressive activities against our country are becoming more and more blatant and more and more vicious.

Taiwan is Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan is part of the Chinese people's liberation cause, and it is the sacred responsibility of the Chinese people to exercise sovereignty and ensure territorial integrity. The broad masses of people of all ethnic groups in China have deep concern for the deep suffering of Taiwanese compatriots, and will never tolerate the American aggressive group and the Chiang Kai-shek traitors enslaving and exploiting Taiwanese compatriots.

Liberating Taiwan has great positive significance for establishing collective peace in Asia and easing international tensions. As Premier Zhou said: "In order to further ease international tensions, in order to consolidate and expand the peaceful situation created by the Indochina ceasefire, and in order to implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the People's Republic of China must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is the struggle to defend world peace."

We Hui people must, together with the people of the whole country, realize the government's call, strengthen our work in all aspects, and strive to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, so as to finally complete the sacred liberation cause of the Chinese people.

China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee Chairman Wu Yaozong's Talk

The agreements reached at the Geneva Conference on the issue of Indochina's ceasefire and restoration of peace once again proved the failure of the American aggressive group's "strength policy," and once again proved the possibility of resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation. Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee expounded the brilliant achievements of the Geneva Conference and the contributions made by the delegation of the People's Republic of China at the Geneva Conference. We express our heartfelt support for this report. This report makes us feel excited, makes us feel the glory of being Chinese people, and greatly increases our confidence in the final victory of the world peace movement.

Premier Zhou put forward the glorious task of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan in his report. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and liberating Taiwan is Chinese sovereignty and internal affairs, which no country is allowed to interfere with. The American aggressive group has recently stepped up its assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, attempting to turn Taiwan into a base for the United States to invade our country for a long time. This not only threatens our country's security and hinders our country's peaceful construction, but also threatens peace in the entire Asia and the world. Therefore, liberating Taiwan not only conforms to the interests of the Chinese people, but also conforms to the interests of peace-loving people all over the world, and will surely receive the support and support of peace-loving people all over the world.

We Christians are peace-loving. We must unite as one, do a good job in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, earnestly carry out patriotic study, completely sever ties with imperialism, actively participate in the motherland's great socialist construction, and respond to the call to liberate Taiwan and strive for lasting world peace with practical actions.
