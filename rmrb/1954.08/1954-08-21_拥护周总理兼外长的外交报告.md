China Democratic National Construction Association Chairman Zhang Bojun's Talk

Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee analyzed the significant achievements of the Geneva Conference, explained China's current peaceful diplomatic policy, and called on the people of the whole country to "struggle to the end to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan and defending world peace." This expresses the common aspirations and guiding principles of the 600 million Chinese people. I, on behalf of all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association, express warm support. We also extend our highest respect to the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou for its outstanding contributions at the Geneva Conference.

The significant achievements of the Geneva Conference show that the reactionary policy of the American aggressive bloc has suffered a shameful defeat, and the American aggressive bloc is becoming increasingly isolated in the eyes of the world. The Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, advocated by our country, have become the common demands of the people all over the world. In order to continue to implement our country's peaceful diplomatic policy, develop our country's cooperative relations with various countries in the world, and ensure Asian and world peace and security, we resolutely respond to the government's call and strive to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to the end.

Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory. The "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation" both clearly stipulate that Taiwan belongs to China. The Chinese people have never forgotten that they must liberate Taiwan. The United States' occupation of Taiwan violates international agreements and undermines China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The United States occupies Taiwan as a military base in order to fulfill its dreams of invading our country, annexing Asia, and dominating the world. Therefore, liberating Taiwan is a part of the Chinese people's liberation cause, and it is also a part of our country's cause of defending world peace. Chiang Kai-shek is a public enemy of the people and a traitor to the nation. He is the executioner who brutally murdered Taiwanese compatriots in the "February 28th" incident. Since being driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people, he and his remaining bandits have occupied Taiwan, exploited the blood and sweat of Taiwanese compatriots, and colluded with the American aggressive bloc to carry out shameless traitorous activities. Recently, relying on the protection of the American naval and air forces, they have harassed and sabotaged our coastal areas, airdropped special agents, plundered overseas Chinese property, looted coastal fishermen, and murdered compatriots. They have even engaged in piracy by intercepting and detaining ships from various countries coming to China for trade, creating international tensions, increasing the threat of war, and preventing our country and other relevant countries from sharing the benefits of peace. These heinous crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are intolerable not only to the Chinese people, but also to the people of the world.

We firmly support the government's repeated declaration: "Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory, which will never be allowed to be occupied by the United States, nor will it be allowed to be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations." Liberating Taiwan is our country's sovereignty and internal affair, and no other country is allowed to interfere. The American aggressive bloc has no right to obstruct or interfere. If the United States dares to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, it must bear all the serious consequences of its aggressive crimes.

In order to restore our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in order to ensure peace and security in Asia and the world, we call on all party members to unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strengthen ideological remolding, work hard to carry out propaganda work, heighten vigilance, overcome difficulties, especially the organizations and members of our party in coastal provinces, should strengthen preparations to support the work of the People's Liberation Army, contribute all their strength, and strive to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan, eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and defending Asian and world peace to the end.

China Zhi Gong Party Chairman Chen Qiyou's Talk

We wholeheartedly support Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on August 11, the various agreements reached at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina, and Premier Zhou's diplomatic activities during the conference and on his visits to various countries on his return trip; we support the joint statements issued by Premier Zhou with the Prime Ministers of India and Burma, and the communiqué of the talks with the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Germany; we support our country's support for all Soviet proposals related to European peace; and finally, we support the national policy of resolutely liberating Taiwan.

Although American imperialism sabotaged the solution to the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, it did not succeed in obstructing and sabotaging the achievement of the Indochina armistice agreement. At present, in addition to stepping up the formation of various Pacific anti-communist alliances in the name of joint defense, encircling our country, stepping up the arming of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and instigating Chiang's bandits to disturb our mainland, it is also directly provoking us and creating the Hainan Island incident. All its crimes are nothing more than to maintain tension in Asia in order to achieve its ambitions of invading China, invading Asia, and dominating the world. If Taiwan is not liberated, not only will the people of our country not be able to live and work in peace and contentment, but peace in Asia and even the world will be threatened. Therefore, liberating Taiwan is not only an action that should be taken to realize the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, but also a step that must be taken to defend peace in Asia and the world!

Taiwan has been our country's territory since ancient times, and American imperialism will never be allowed to occupy it, nor will it be allowed to be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations. Liberating Taiwan is our country's internal affair, and no foreign country is allowed to interfere. However, the American aggressive bloc has the audacity to openly declare that it will prevent us from liberating Taiwan, which is something we absolutely cannot tolerate! With unparalleled determination and confidence, the people of our country must liberate Taiwan and complete the entire liberation cause. We will not stop until we achieve our goal!

Under the leadership of the great and correct Chinese Communist Party and the wise Chairman Mao, our country has become an unprecedentedly powerful country, and recently achieved a great diplomatic victory at the Geneva Conference. In addition, we have the People's Liberation Army, which has been tempered into steel, and the unity of the people of the whole country. We are fully confident of liberating Taiwan. We believe that the Taiwanese compatriots who are in deep water and fire will also take coordinated actions for their own liberation. The military and political personnel who have been deceived and oppressed by Chiang Kai-shek, as long as they realize that they are Chinese, understand all the achievements of the motherland, and are unwilling to be the tools of Chiang Kai-shek, the American aggressive bloc's running dogs, they will also abandon the dark and come over to the light, and rise up to return to the fold.

The Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou did a great job at the Geneva Conference and made great contributions. We pay our highest respect to Premier Zhou and the delegation, and we are willing to do everything in our power to liberate Taiwan and realize peace in Asia and the world.

All-China Students' Federation Vice Chairman Guan Ruoluan's Talk

Chinese students fully agree with the diplomatic report made by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. We wholeheartedly support and support the peaceful diplomatic policy of our government, and warmly celebrate the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou at the Geneva Conference and in extensive friendly visits. We resolutely respond to the call of the Central People's Government to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in order to finally complete the sacred liberation cause of the Chinese people.

Chinese students clearly know that American imperialism is definitely not willing to accept its failure. It still stubbornly implements the aggressive policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, creating international tensions, stubbornly obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, attempting to undermine the implementation of various agreements on restoring peace in Indochina, and plotting to piece together the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group" and "Northeast Asia Defense League" with China as the main target of opposition. At the same time, it continues to occupy our Taiwan, plans to sign a so-called "bilateral common security treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and intensifies its instigation and assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out harassment and destructive wars against the Chinese mainland and coastal areas, attempting to restore Chiang Kai-shek, a handful of dregs of humanity, in China and turn the entire China into a colony of the United States. Chinese students will never tolerate this barbaric act of aggression by American imperialism.

Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan is the glorious historical task of the Chinese people and the sacred responsibility of Chinese students. Chinese students deeply know that only by liberating Taiwan from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique supported by American imperialism can the complete unification of our great motherland be realized, the Chinese people's liberation cause can be completely victorious, and the peace of the Far East and the world can be effectively guaranteed. Students across the country infinitely sympathize with and care about the Taiwanese compatriots who are under the fascist rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The crimes and blood debts of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in expelling and arresting a large number of Taiwanese students, forcing them to serve as cannon fodder, and carrying out killings and various persecutions against them must be settled. Taiwanese students and Taiwanese compatriots are still living in a painful life of deep water and fire, which Chinese students consider to be their own shame. Chinese students with a patriotic tradition will study and exercise more diligently, respond to the call of the motherland at any time, and be prepared to contribute all their strength to defend and build the motherland and liberate Taiwan. We hope that Taiwanese students will hold high the glorious banner of patriotic liberation, unite more closely, and, together with the people of Taiwan, continue to resolutely launch a heroic struggle against American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and actively prepare to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan with practical actions. Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we firmly believe that Taiwanese students and Taiwanese compatriots will inevitably return to the embrace of the motherland, and victory will surely belong to the righteous people of the motherland.

China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Chairman Guo Moruo's Talk

The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, on behalf of all Chinese literary and art workers, warmly expresses: We fully support Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report and the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on August 11.

In his report, Premier Zhou expounded extremely incisively on the achievements of the Geneva Conference and the achievements of our country's peaceful diplomacy. All these achievements prove the further growth of world peace forces and the increasing weakening of aggressive forces; proving that a policy of peace will surely defeat a policy of aggression. The People's Republic of China has become a great force for ensuring peace and security in Asia and the world, and its important position and great role in international affairs are becoming increasingly prominent. The tasks of the Chinese people in the future, as Premier Zhou pointed out, are to work hard with relevant countries to jointly ensure the thorough implementation of the various agreements on restoring peace in Indochina reached at the Geneva Conference, and to continue to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue; to consolidate and develop our country's peaceful and cooperative relations with various countries in accordance with the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, and to strive to establish collective peace in Asia.

In his report, Premier Zhou mentioned another important task of ours at present, which is to liberate Taiwan and safeguard the integrity of our country's sovereignty and territory. Taiwan is part of our country's sacred and inviolable territory. Since Taiwan was forcibly occupied by Japanese imperialism in 1895, the Chinese people living in Taiwan and the Chinese people living on the mainland have waged a long-term struggle to liberate Taiwan from the enslavement of Japanese aggressors. Finally, in the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Taiwan was recovered. However, after the Chinese people achieved the great victory of the People's Liberation War, the American aggressive bloc first sheltered the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who fled to Taiwan, and then openly occupied Taiwan, replacing Japanese imperialism in enslaving our Taiwanese compatriots, and actively supported Chiang's bandits, attempting to use this small group of traitorous groups to further invade our country and undermine peace in Asia. The Chinese people across the country cannot tolerate this heinous crime of the American aggressive bloc. Recently, due to the armistice in Korea and the restoration of peace in Indochina, the tense situation in Asia has gradually eased. The American aggressive bloc has further used the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out harassment and destructive wars against our mainland and coastal areas in order to expand its aggressive actions. This is a further provocation and threat to our People's Republic of China, and it is also a further provocation and threat to peace in Asia and world peace. In order to safeguard the integrity of our country's sovereignty and territory, and in order to defend peace and security in Asia and the world, we must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is the struggle to defend world peace. All of us literary and art workers resolutely respond to the call of the Central People's Government Committee, stand at our posts, work hard to strengthen our work, strive to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, so as to complete the sacred liberation cause of our Chinese people, and make unremitting struggles to defend peace in Asia and the world!

China Association for Science and Technology Chairman Li Siguang's Talk

Premier Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee comprehensively explained how China made tremendous contributions to the cause of defending world peace in diplomacy during the Geneva Conference; at the same time, it also pointed out that in order to implement the policy of peace, we must resolutely complete the final glorious task in the great cause of liberating the whole country—liberating Taiwan. I, on behalf of the China Association for Science and Technology, express warm support for this historically significant report.

Thanks to the achievements of the Geneva Conference, the Vietnamese people, who fought bravely against the colonial war, have achieved a comprehensive ceasefire for the first time for more than eight years on the basis of the independence and autonomy requirements of various countries in Indochina. Thanks to the achievements of the Geneva Conference, the peace forces, which have rapidly grown stronger, have prevented the war-mongers from expanding the war plot, thereby easing international tensions. Under such significant pressure, even the American delegation had to submit a guarantee in the form of a written confession that "the United States will not use threats or force to harm these agreements and clauses." We congratulate the people of Indochina and rejoice for the people around the world who are striving for independence and loving peace. This is the great achievement of the first great power conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China, and we are proud of this.

During the Geneva Conference, due to the great role played by Premier Zhou on behalf of our Central People's Government, the achievements outside the meeting were no less than the agreements reached at the meeting. The achievements in this regard are specifically reflected in the joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India, and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, as well as the communiqués of the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and Germany. From then on, we have established the broadest, most reasonable, and most in line with the current international situation, the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence for adjusting international relations; for the issue of European peace, we have also accurately pointed out the key. All these achievements clearly show that it is a further development of the peaceful policy of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, that is, it provides practical norms for the specific ways of handling international disputes in the spirit of consultation.

However, the American war bloc, which has consistently attempted to undermine world peace, is unwilling to accept defeat. As is well known, before the ink was dry on the statement signed by the American representative stating that it would not use force to hinder the Indochina armistice agreement, they were doing everything possible to undermine the Korean armistice agreement, and were still engaged in the so-called "Southeast Asia" and even the "Northeast Asia," which has never been heard of in geography, so-called defense groups that many discerning Asian countries have ignored, aiming at aggression against China. In particular, recently, they have been providing a large amount of manpower and material resources to the Chiang Kai-shek remnants in Taiwan, who have been spurned by the Chinese people, and have instigated them to carry out armed harassment in the southeastern region of the motherland and pirate-style looting of foreign merchant ships coming to our country for peaceful trade. Under the instigation of American war-mongers, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has even unscrupulously continued to clamor to expand the scope of the war and expect the flames of the Third World War to be ignited sooner or later. The existence of this war threat, especially within Chinese territory, is something that the Chinese people can never tolerate. It is also something that peace-loving people all over the world cannot ignore.

Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times. The compatriots in Taiwan, like the compatriots in other provinces of the motherland, are all Chinese people. The criminal fact that this territory of the motherland was forcibly occupied by Japanese militarists from 1895 to 1945 fueled the ambitions of the aggressors and allowed them to expand the scope of aggression, resulting in increasingly tense Sino-Japanese relations and the Asian situation for half a century, which ultimately led to the rampage of Japanese militarists to launch a frenzied attack on the entire Asia and even Australia, which was one of the main reasons for undermining world peace. The Chinese people's decades of struggle experience and bloody lessons make us never allow such a criminal history to repeat itself, and never allow our territory of Taiwan to fall into the hands of any aggressive group again, so that they can use it as a base for attacking the mainland of the motherland or any Asian country. The Chinese people will also never allow any foreign group to use the fact that a small group of traitorous groups, who are sheltered and fostered by them and spurned by the people of the whole country, are temporarily entrenched on the territory of the motherland, and forcibly insert their representatives into the United Nations, usurping the legal status of the People's Republic of China, and excluding the role that the People's Republic of China should and can play in the international family for the benefit of international peace.

It must be pointed out that punishing the Chiang Kai-shek traitor within the territory of our country is entirely our internal affair and sovereignty, which no one is allowed to interfere with. Regarding this point, Mr. Attlee, who recently visited China, said well: If any country other than the United States supported Bugoni and established a rebel base in Long Island to launch armed attacks on other parts of the United States of America, how would the American government and people treat it?

Therefore, in order to realize a sacred clause of the draft constitution recently formulated by our people themselves—to ensure the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, for the security of the motherland, and for peace in Asia and the world, our national scientific workers must stand with the people of the whole country, respond to the call of our Central People's Government, and resolutely contribute all our strength to the glorious task of liberating Taiwan through our respective posts. We do not have any侥幸 心思, nor do we underestimate certain technical difficulties. But we firmly believe that with the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the incomparably strong forces formed by the unity of the people of the whole country, and with the support of all peace-loving and justice-upholding people and governments in the world, this source of war and threat to peace can be completely eradicated. Glory belongs to the people of the motherland. With the eradication of this source of trouble, the cause of peace in Asia and the world can be further guaranteed.

China Islamic Cultural Association Deputy Director Bai Shouyi's Talk

Premier Zhou's recent diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee specifically analyzed the achievements of the Geneva Conference for the cause of peace, profoundly exposed the American aggressive group's conspiracy to undermine peace and consistently oppose the Chinese people, and clearly pointed out the important tasks of the Chinese people in the current international environment. The Chinese Hui people fully agree with and sincerely support this report, and are proud of the profound growth of the strength of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong for Premier Zhou's outstanding contributions in the Geneva Conference process.

Since the day our People's Republic of China was established, the American aggressive group has been trying every possible means to conspire to undermine the People's Republic of China. It launched the Korean War of aggression, intensified its interference in the Indochina War, and sent a fleet to invade our Taiwan Strait. Not long ago, its conspiracy in Korea failed. Due to the success of the Geneva Conference, its conspiracy in Indochina also failed. But it is not reconciled to its failure, but intensifies its instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group entrenched in Taiwan to carry out increasingly rampant harassment and destructive activities against our southeastern coastal areas and islands, plundering people's property, luring young people, and looting merchant ships. The American aggressive group's aggressive activities against our country are becoming more and more blatant and more and more vicious.

Taiwan is Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan is part of the Chinese people's liberation cause, and it is the sacred responsibility of the Chinese people to exercise sovereignty and ensure territorial integrity. The broad masses of people of all ethnic groups in China have deep concern for the deep suffering of Taiwanese compatriots, and will never tolerate the American aggressive group and the Chiang Kai-shek traitors enslaving and exploiting Taiwanese compatriots.

Liberating Taiwan has great positive significance for establishing collective peace in Asia and easing international tensions. As Premier Zhou said: "In order to further ease international tensions, in order to consolidate and expand the peaceful situation created by the Indochina ceasefire, and in order to implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the People's Republic of China must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is the struggle to defend world peace."

We Hui people must, together with the people of the whole country, realize the government's call, strengthen our work in all aspects, and strive to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, so as to finally complete the sacred liberation cause of the Chinese people.

China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee Chairman Wu Yaozong's Talk

The agreements reached at the Geneva Conference on the issue of Indochina's ceasefire and restoration of peace once again proved the failure of the American aggressive group's "strength policy," and once again proved the possibility of resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation. Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee expounded the brilliant achievements of the Geneva Conference and the contributions made by the delegation of the People's Republic of China at the Geneva Conference. We express our heartfelt support for this report. This report makes us feel excited, makes us feel the glory of being Chinese people, and greatly increases our confidence in the final victory of the world peace movement.

Premier Zhou put forward the glorious task of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan in his report. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and liberating Taiwan is Chinese sovereignty and internal affairs, which no country is allowed to interfere with. The American aggressive group has recently stepped up its assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, attempting to turn Taiwan into a base for the United States to invade our country for a long time. This not only threatens our country's security and hinders our country's peaceful construction, but also threatens peace in the entire Asia and the world. Therefore, liberating Taiwan not only conforms to the interests of the Chinese people, but also conforms to the interests of peace-loving people all over the world, and will surely receive the support and support of peace-loving people all over the world.

We Christians are peace-loving. We must unite as one, do a good job in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, earnestly carry out patriotic study, completely sever ties with imperialism, actively participate in the motherland's great socialist construction, and respond to the call to liberate Taiwan and strive for lasting world peace with practical actions.

    拥护周总理兼外长的外交报告
    中国农工民主党主席章伯钧的谈话
    周恩来总理兼外交部部长在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上所作的外交报告，分析了日内瓦会议的重大成就，说明了当前我国和平外交的方针，号召全国人民“为完成解放台湾、保卫世界和平的光荣任务而奋斗到底”，这是表达了六万万中国人民的共同愿望和行动的准则，我代表中国农工民主党全体党员表示热烈的拥护。并对以周总理为首的我国代表团在日内瓦会议上所作出的卓越贡献，致以崇高的敬意。
    日内瓦会议的重大成就，表明了美国侵略集团的反动政策遭到了可耻的失败，美国侵略集团在世界人民面前越来越孤立。我国主张的互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处的五项原则，已成为全世界人民共同的要求。为了继续贯彻我国的和平外交政策，发展我国与世界各国的合作关系，保障亚洲及世界和平安全，我们坚决响应政府的号召，为解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团而奋斗到底。
    台湾是我国神圣不可侵犯的领土，“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”都明确地规定了台湾属于中国，中国人民没有一天忘记要解放台湾。美国侵占台湾，是违反国际协定的，是破坏中国主权和领土完整的。美国侵占台湾作为军事基地，以遂其侵略我国、吞并亚洲、独霸世界的迷梦。所以解放台湾是我国人民解放事业的一部分，同时也是我国保卫世界和平事业的一部分。蒋介石是人民的公敌，是民族的叛徒，他是“二·二八”惨杀台湾同胞的刽子手；自被中国人民赶出大陆之后，就和他的残余匪徒，盘踞台湾，压榨台湾同胞的血汗，勾结美国侵略集团，进行无耻的卖国活动。最近，依靠美国海空军的庇护，对我国沿海地区进行骚扰和破坏，空投特务，掠夺华侨财产，劫掠沿海渔民，杀害同胞，更以海盗行为拦劫和扣留各国来华通商的船舶，制造国际的紧张局势，增加战争威胁，使我国和其他有关国家不能共享和平的利益。蒋介石卖国贼的这些滔天罪行，不但为我国人民所不能容忍，也为全世界人民所不能容忍。
    我们坚决拥护政府再一次宣布：“台湾是中国神圣不可侵犯的领土，决不容许美国侵占，也决不容许交给联合国托管。”解放台湾是我国的主权和内政，决不容许他国干涉。美国侵略集团，无权阻挠，无权过问。如果美国敢于阻止我国人民解放台湾，就必须由其承担侵略罪行的一切严重后果。
    为了恢复我国主权和领土的完整，为了保障亚洲及世界的和平与安全，我们号召全党成员更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，加强思想改造，努力进行宣传工作，提高警惕，克服困难，特别是我党沿海各省的组织和成员，更应加强准备支援人民解放军的工作，贡献所有的力量，为完成解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国贼，保卫亚洲及世界和平的光荣任务而奋斗到底。
    中国致公党主席陈其尤的谈话
    我们衷心地拥护周恩来总理兼外长八月十一日在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上所作的外交报告、日内瓦会议所达成的关于恢复印度支那和平的各项协议和周总理在会议期间、返国途中访问各国的外交活动；我们拥护周总理分别与印度和缅甸总理发表的联合声明、与民主德国总理发表的会谈公报；我们拥护我们国家支持苏联对欧洲和平有关的一切建议；最后，我们拥护坚决解放台湾的国策。
    美帝国主义在日内瓦会议上虽然破坏了朝鲜问题的解决，但阻挠、破坏印度支那停战协议的达成却没有成功，目前它除了加紧拼凑以共同防御为名的各种各样太平洋反共同盟，包围我国，加紧武装蒋介石卖国集团，唆使蒋贼扰乱我大陆外，并且还自己直接向我挑衅，制造海南岛事件。它的这一切罪行，无非为了保持亚洲紧张局势，以达到它侵略中国、侵略亚洲独霸世界的野心。台湾不解放，不仅我国人民不得安居乐业，亚洲以至世界的和平都要受到威胁。因此，解放台湾，不仅是实现我国领土主权完整所应有的行动，亦为保卫亚洲及世界和平所必须采取的步骤！
    台湾自古以来即是我国领土，决不容许美帝国主义侵占，也决不容许交联合国托管。解放台湾是我国的内政，不容许任何外国干涉。但是美国侵略集团竟厚颜无耻公开宣布要阻止我们解放台湾，这是我们绝对不能容忍的事！我们全国人民以无比坚强的决心和信心，一定要解放台湾，完成全部的解放事业，不达目的，决不休止！
    我们的国家在伟大的正确的中国共产党和英明的毛主席的领导之下，已成为空前强大的国家，最近更在日内瓦会议上获得外交上的伟大的胜利，加以我们有百炼成钢的人民解放军和全国人民的团结，我们是有充分把握解放台湾的。我们相信，在水深火热中的台湾同胞，也必然会为了自己的解放，协同动作，被蒋介石所蒙蔽和压迫的军政人员，只要他们认识到自己是中国人，明白了祖国的一切成就，不愿再做美国侵略集团的走狗蒋介石的工具，他们也必然会弃暗投明，起义来归。
    以周总理为首的我国代表团在日内瓦会议中做了巨大的工作，贡献极大，我们对周总理和代表团致以无上的敬意，同时愿尽我们的一切力量为解放台湾，实现亚洲以至世界的和平而努力。
    中华全国学生联合会副主席关若鸾的谈话
    中国学生完全同意周恩来总理兼外交部部长的外交报告，我们衷心地拥护和支持我国政府的和平外交政策，热烈地庆贺以周总理为首的我国代表团在日内瓦会议上和广泛的友好访问中所获得的光辉成就。我们坚决响应中央人民政府的号召，要解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团、以最后完成我国人民的神圣的解放事业。
    中国学生清楚地知道，美帝国主义是决不甘心自己失败的。它仍然顽固地实行扩军备战的侵略政策，制造国际紧张局势，蛮横地阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题，企图破坏恢复印度支那和平各项协议的实现，阴谋拼凑以中国为主要敌对目标的所谓“东南亚防御集团”、“东北亚防御联盟”，同时继续霸占我国台湾，策划与蒋介石卖国集团订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”，加紧指使和援助蒋介石卖国集团对中国大陆和沿海进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，妄图使蒋贼介石一小撮人类的渣滓在中国复辟，变整个中国为美国的殖民地。中国学生决不能容忍美帝国主义这种野蛮的侵略行动。
    台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，解放台湾是我国人民光荣的历史任务，也是中国学生神圣的职责。中国学生深知：只有把台湾从美帝国主义支持下的蒋介石卖国集团统治下解放出来，我们伟大祖国的完全统一才能实现，中国人民解放事业才是获得了完全胜利，从而有力地进一步保障远东及世界的和平。全国学生无限同情和关怀在蒋介石卖国集团法西斯统治下的台湾同胞。蒋介石卖国集团把大批台湾的同学开除、逮捕，强迫他们充当炮灰，对他们进行残杀和各种迫害的罪行和血债必须加以清算。台湾同学和台湾同胞仍然在水深火热的痛苦生活中，中国学生认为是自己的耻辱。有着爱国主义传统的中国学生，决以更加努力学习和锻炼身体，随时响应祖国的号召，准备为保卫和建设祖国，为解放台湾而贡献出自己的一切力量。我们希望台湾同学高举着光荣的爱国解放的旗帜，更紧密地团结起来，和全台湾的人民一道，继续向美国帝国主义、蒋介石卖国集团坚决地展开英勇的斗争，用实际的行动积极准备配合人民解放军解放台湾。在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席领导下，我们深信台湾同学和台湾同胞必然会回到祖国怀抱里来，胜利一定属于正义的祖国人民。
    中国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若的谈话
    中国文学艺术界联合会代表全中国文学艺术工作者热烈地表示：完全拥护周总理兼外交部部长八月十一日在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上所作的外交报告和中央人民政府委员会的决议。
    周总理在他的报告中极其精辟地论述了日内瓦会议的成果和我国和平外交的成就。所有这些成就，证明了世界和平力量的进一步增长，侵略势力的日益削弱；证明了和平政策一定战胜侵略政策。中华人民共和国已成为保障亚洲及世界的和平与安全的宏大力量，它在国际事务中的重要地位和巨大作用日益显著了。中国人民今后的任务，正如周总理所指出的：就是要努力与有关国家共同保证彻底实现日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的各项协议，并继续谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决；要根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处等五项原则，巩固和发展我国与各国的和平合作关系，并努力建立亚洲的集体和平。
    周总理在他的报告中提到我们当前的另一项重大任务，就是一定要解放台湾，保障我国主权和领土的完整。台湾是我国神圣不可侵犯的领土的一部分。自一八九五年台湾被日本帝国主义强占后，住在台湾的中国人民和住在大陆的中国人民，为了把台湾从日本侵略者的奴役下解放出来，作了长期的斗争。终于在抗日战争的胜利中，使台湾光复了。可是，在中国人民取得了人民解放战争的伟大胜利之后，美国侵略集团始则庇护着逃亡台湾的蒋介石卖国集团，继则公然侵占台湾，代替日本帝国主义奴役我台湾同胞，并积极扶植蒋贼，企图利用这一小撮卖国集团进一步侵犯我国，破坏亚洲的和平。美国侵略集团这一滔天罪行，是我全国人民所不能容忍的。近来，由于朝鲜的停战和印度支那和平的恢复，亚洲的紧张局势逐步趋于和缓，美国侵略集团就更加利用蒋介石卖国集团，对我国大陆和沿海进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，以扩大它的侵略行动。这是对我中华人民共和国的进一步的挑衅和威胁，也是对亚洲和平与世界和平的进一步的挑衅和威胁。为了保障我国主权和领土的完整，为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平与安全，我们必须解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。中国人民解放台湾的斗争就是保卫世界和平的斗争。我们全体文学艺术工作者坚决响应中央人民政府委员会的号召，站在我们的岗位上，努力加强工作，为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团、以完成我中国人民的神圣解放事业，并为保卫亚洲和世界的和平而作不懈的斗争！
    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会主席李四光的谈话
    周恩来总理在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上所作的外交报告，全面地说明了日内瓦会议期间我国在外交方面对保卫世界和平的事业作了如何巨大的贡献；同时也指出了为了贯彻和平政策，我们必须坚决地完成解放全国的大业中最后的一个光荣任务——解放台湾。我代表中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会对这一具有历史意义的报告表示热烈的拥护。
    由于日内瓦会议的成就，为了反对殖民战争而英勇斗争的越南人民，八年多以来，在印度支那各个国家独立自主的要求基本上得到了保障的基础上，第一次获得了全面停战。由于日内瓦会议的成就，迅速地更加壮大起来了的和平力量制止了好战分子扩大战争的阴谋，从而和缓了国际紧张局势。在这样重大压力之下，连美国代表团也不得不以书面自首的形式提出了“美国将不使用威胁或武力去妨害这些协定和条款”的保证。我们为印度支那人民祝贺，也为全世界争取独立、爱好和平的人民庆幸。这是第一次有了中华人民共和国参加的大国会议的伟大成就，在这一点上我们感到骄傲。
    在日内瓦会议期间，由于我周总理代表我中央人民政府所起的巨大作用，在会外的成就，决不逊于在会上达成的协议。在这一方面的成就，具体表现在中印两国、中缅两国总理的联合声明以及中德两国总理会谈公报。从此我们对于调整国际关系，建立了最广泛、最合理、而且最切合当前国际形势的，互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则；对欧洲和平问题，也确切地指明了关键所在。所有这些成就，很清楚，是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的和平政策的进一步发展，也就是对于以协商精神处理国际争端的具体方式，提供了实际的规范。
    但是一贯企图破坏世界和平的美国战争集团是不甘心失败的。如所周知，在美国代表签署将不以武力妨害印度支那停战协定的声明墨迹未干的时候，他们就在千方百计地想破坏朝鲜停战协定，并且还在搞许多明眼的亚洲国家所不理睬的、以侵略中国为目标的什么“东南亚”、甚至地理学上从未听说过的“东北亚”所谓防御集团。尤其近来更以大量人力、物力接济为中国人民所唾弃的、盘据在台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮，策动他们向祖国东南地区肆行武装骚扰，并对来到我国从事和平贸易的各国商船进行海盗式的掠夺。由于美国好战分子的鼓动，蒋介石卖国集团甚至肆无忌惮地不断发出叫嚣，要扩大战争范围，朝夕期望燃起第三次大战的战火。这个战争威胁的存在，特别是存在于中国领土之内，是中国人民所绝不能容许的。也是全世界爱好和平的人民所不容忽视的。
    台湾很古以来就是中国的领土。台湾的同胞和祖国其他各省的同胞一样，都是中国的人民。祖国这一块领土在一八九五年至一九四五年期间被日本军国主义者所强占的罪恶事实，就是助长了侵略者的野心，放任了他们扩大侵略范围，造成了半个世纪来越来越紧张的中日关系和亚洲局势，以致最后导致日本军国主义者竟猖獗到向整个亚洲乃至澳洲发动了猖狂进攻、破坏了世界和平的主要原因之一。中国人民几十年来的斗争经验和血的教训使我们决不允许这种罪恶的历史重演，决不允许再一次让我们的领土台湾沦陷到任何侵略集团的手里，以致被他们用来作为向祖国大陆或任何亚洲国家进攻的基地。中国人民也决不允许任何外国集团借口他们所庇护和豢养而被全国人民所唾弃的一小撮卖国集团暂时盘据在祖国领土上的事实，而硬把他们的代表塞在联合国里，僭窃中华人民共和国的合法地位，排斥中华人民共和国在国际大家庭中对于有利国际和平事业所应起而且能够起的作用。
    必须指出，在我国领土范围内惩办蒋介石卖国贼完全是我们的内政和主权，这是决不容许别人来干涉的。关于这一点，最近来华访问的艾德礼先生说得好：假如任何一个美国以外的国家把布戈尼支持起来，在长岛建立一个反叛美国的根据地，向美利坚合众国其他各地肆行武装攻击，美国政府和人民将如何对待？
    因此，为了实现最近由我们人民自己制定的宪法草案的一个神圣的条款——保证我国领土主权完整，为了祖国的安全，为了亚洲及世界和平，我们全国科学工作者必须和全国人民站在一起，响应我中央人民政府的号召，坚决地为解放台湾这一光荣的任务，通过我们各自的岗位工作，贡献我们每一个人的全部力量。我们不存任何侥幸的心思，也不低估某些技术上的困难。但是我们坚信，有了中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，有了由于全国人民一致团结起来而形成的无比坚强的力量，有了全世界
  一切爱好和平和主持正义的人民和政府的支持，这个制造战争、威胁和平的祸根是完全可以根本铲除的。光荣是属于祖国人民的。亚洲和世界的和平事业，由于这一祸根的铲除，是可以更进一步得到保障的。
    中国回民文化协进会副主任白寿彝的谈话
    周总理最近在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上所作的外交报告，具体地分析了日内瓦会议对于和平事业的成就，深刻地揭发了美国侵略集团破坏和平、一贯和中国人民为敌的阴谋，明确地指出了我国人民在目前国际环境中的重要任务，中国回族人民完全同意和衷诚地拥护这个报告，并为周总理在日内瓦会议过程中的卓越的贡献，感到中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民力量的深厚的增长。
    自从我们中华人民共和国成立的一天起，美国侵略集团就千方百计地对中华人民共和国进行破坏的阴谋。它发动侵略朝鲜战争，加紧干涉印度支那战争，并派遣舰队侵入我国台湾海峡。在不久以前，它在朝鲜的阴谋失败了。由于日内瓦会议的成功，它在印度支那的阴谋也失败了。但它不甘心于自己的失败，却加紧指使盘踞台湾的蒋介石卖国集团对我国东南沿海地区和岛屿日益猖獗地进行骚扰性和破坏性的活动，掠夺人民财产，诱骗青年，劫掠商船。美国侵略集团对我国的侵略活动是越来越露骨，越来越狠毒了。
    台湾是中国的领土。解放台湾是中国人民解放事业的一部分，是中国人民行使主权和保障领土完整的神圣责任。中国各族的广大人民对于台湾同胞的深重的灾难有深切的关怀，决不容忍美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国贼奴役和压榨台湾的同胞。
    解放台湾对于建立亚洲的集体和平、缓和国际紧张局势有重大的积极的意义。正如周总理所说：“为了进一步和缓国际紧张局势，为了巩固和扩大由于印度支那停战而产生的和平局面，为了贯彻和平共处的五项原则，中华人民共和国必须解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。中国人民解放台湾的斗争就是保卫世界和平的斗争。”
    我们回族人民要和全国人民一起，实现政府的号召，从各方面加强工作，为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团、以最后完成中国人民的神圣解放事业而奋斗。
    中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会主席吴耀宗的谈话
    日内瓦会议关于印度支那停战和恢复和平问题所达成的协议又一次证明了美国侵略集团“实力政策”的失败，又一次证明了用和平协商方式来解决国际争端的可能。周恩来总理兼外交部长在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上的外交报告阐述了日内瓦会议的辉煌成就和中华人民共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上所作的贡献。我们对这个报告表示衷心的拥护。这个报告使我们感到兴奋，使我们感到作为中国人民的光荣，也大大地增加了我们对世界和平运动最后胜利的信心。
    周总理在报告中提出了中国人民解放台湾的光荣任务。台湾是中国的领土，解放台湾是中国的主权和内政，决不容许任何国家加以干涉。美国侵略集团最近加紧对蒋介石卖国集团的援助，企图把台湾变为美国长期侵略我国的基地，这不但威胁了我国的安全，妨害了我国的和平建设，也威胁了整个亚洲和世界的和平。因此，解放台湾不但符合中国人民的利益，也符合全世界爱好和平的人民的利益，一定会得到全世界爱好和平的人民的支持与拥护。
    我们基督徒是热爱和平的。我们必定团结一致，做好三自爱国运动，认真进行爱国主义学习，彻底割断与帝国主义的关系，积极参加祖国伟大的社会主义建设，以实际的行动来响应解放台湾和争取世界持久和平的号召。（新华社）
