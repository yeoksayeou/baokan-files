The "Not Seeking Thorough Understanding" Attitude in Translation
Ke Lian

Please consider the following translated passage:
	“The great satirical writer Saltykov-Shchedrin was very right about the significance of satirically depicting all the ugliness in life. He wrote: 'This weapon is very sharp, because nothing can frustrate the edge of evil habits more than consciousness, so that this evil habit is recognized, and laughter is directed at it.'”

What does this mean? In my opinion, no one can understand such a translation. Who could believe that this inexplicable sentence would come from the mouth of the great satirical writer Saltykov-Shchedrin?

Would he really say that "consciousness" is something that can "frustrate the edge of evil habits"? And how is it evident that it is "more able to frustrate the edge of evil habits" than "anything else"? If this "consciousness" is an ugly consciousness, how can it "frustrate" the "edge of evil habits"? What exactly did Shchedrin say?

Readers cannot understand such a translation. This passage was published in the July issue of "Learning Translation Series," and the original was from the Soviet magazine "Communist," titled "Striving for Further Improvement of Soviet Literature."

Another translation of this passage is more understandable:
	"The great satirical writer Saltykov-Shchedrin correctly spoke about the significance of satirically depicting all the ugliness in life. 'This weapon is very powerful,' he wrote, 'nothing weakens sin more than the realization that it has been discovered and laughed at.'" (Translation from "Literary Gazette," issue 14 of this year.)

Regarding this translation, readers will believe that the translator understood the meaning of the original before translating. As for the former translation, it makes readers wonder: did the translator himself understand Shchedrin's words?

In the same translated article, there is also the following sentence:
	"The centuries-long literature of the Soviet peoples, such as the Tashkent people, Azerbaijanis, and Georgians, is rich, but only until the first writers' congress was convened was there poetry in literature."

What does this sentence mean? The first half says that these nations have a long and rich literary tradition; but the second half says that until the first writers' congress was convened, these nations only had poetry! If this is the case, what is the ancient literature of these nations?

Another translation is as follows:
	"The historically long literature of the Soviet nationalities like Tajikistan (omitted) is very rich, but even the literature of these nationalities was mainly poetry at the time of the first writers' congress." (See the same issue of "Literary Gazette")

Although this translation also has incorrect aspects (such as: it cannot be said to be "at the time of the...congress," and the name of the nation cannot be translated as a place name), it is basically understandable, that is, the literature of those nations in the past was mainly just poetry. And now? -- The following goes on to say that now novels and plays have also been produced. Isn't that very clear?

Even more confusing are the paragraphs in the "Learning Translation Series" article about criticizing bourgeois critics who slander Soviet writers. The basic content of the original text is: those critics pretended to say that Soviet writers should "speak the truth," should not be "insincere," should not "propagate," and should not "preach." The translation is as follows:
	"Bourgeois critics assert that if a writer wants to be a devout person, he should repent instead of propagating. How do they understand repentance? Reactionary bourgeois artists try their best to turn their souls inside out, exposing all the dirty parts of this soul, (omitted) they even believe that describing such harmful behavior is abiding by the principle of piety in art!
	"These gentlemen do not know, nor do they want to know, the true, high piety..."

What are "repentance" and "piety"? What is the "principle of piety in art"?
	The translation in "Literary Gazette" is more understandable:
	"Bourgeois critics want to make people believe that if a writer's intention is sincere, then he should write his innermost thoughts, instead of preaching. What do they mean by this innermost thought? Reactionary bourgeois artists try their best to turn their hearts inside out, laying bare every dirty corner of this heart, (omitted) describing this kind of ugly and vulgar thing, they think is abiding by the principle of 'sincerity' in art!..."

After this passage, the original text quoted poems by poets such as Pushkin and Lermontov, who promoted truth and called on humanity to move forward. The author said that everyone would admit that these poems are highly poetic. The author asked, are these poems sincere words? Or are they preaching? It should be said that they are both sincere words and preaching.

However, the translation in "Learning Translation Series" continues to get entangled in a long string of tangled "piety" and "repentance": "What is this? Is it repentance or propaganda? It's both repentance and propaganda!" "Bourgeois artists verbally deny propaganda and advocate repentance..."

How can those loud and powerful poems of Pushkin and Lermontov be said to be "repentance"?

In this translation of "Learning Translation Series", there are many other words and phrases that are translated unclearly and inappropriately, which will not be listed here one by one.

The translation in "Literary Gazette" is better, but it also has its shortcomings and inaccuracies. What is even more unacceptable is that the translator repeatedly omitted some words and phrases, and even deleted entire paragraphs. The author listed the names of some important progressive writers in the world today in the original text, and I don't know why the translator deleted the names of Amado and Tokunaga Sunao.

Both of these magazines are national publications. "Learning Translation Series" is even a journal specializing in translating theoretical works, and it often selects and translates important literary reviews, which are welcomed by the literary and art circles. However, the "not seeking thorough understanding" attitude in translation shown by the translator of this article is not good.

In order to be responsible to the readers and to important academic works, translators must first thoroughly understand the meaning of the original text before starting to write, so that it is possible to accurately express the original meaning. To translate texts in a certain field, one should strive to master the business knowledge of that field. To translate literary theory, one should strengthen one's own literary theory cultivation.

The hard work of young translators who still lack experience and cultivation is commendable. Their abilities will gradually improve as long as they are realistic, humbly strengthen their studies, and improve their work.

Literary translation is one of the important ideological tasks. Carrying out criticism and self-criticism of translation work in appropriate newspapers and periodicals will help improve and further develop literary translation work.

### “不求甚解”的翻译态度

    “不求甚解”的翻译态度
    柯涟
    请看下面这一段译文：
      “伟大的讽刺作家萨尔蒂柯夫—谢德林关于讽刺地描写生活中的一切丑态的意义说得很对。他写道：‘这个武器非常锋利，因为没有任何东西比意识更能挫折恶习的锐气，以致这种恶习被识破了，对它的嘲笑也发出来了。’”
    这是什么意思呢？照我推想，这样的译文是谁都看不懂的。谁能相信这句莫名其妙的话会出于伟大的讽刺作家萨尔蒂柯夫—谢德林之口呢？
    难道他竟会把“意识”说成是一种能够“挫折恶习的锐气”的东西吗？而且何以见得它比“任何东西”都要“更能挫折恶习的锐气”呢？要是这个“意识”是一种丑恶的意识，它又怎么能去“挫折”什么“恶习的锐气”呢？谢德林究竟说了些什么话呢？
    读者是无法看懂这样的译文的。这段译文登在
  “学习译丛”本年七月号里，原文载苏联“共产党人”杂志，题目是“为进一步提高苏联文学而斗争”。
    这段话的另一种译文是比较能看得懂的：
      “伟大讽刺作家萨尔蒂科夫—谢德林曾正确地谈过讽刺地描写生活中的一切丑恶的意义。‘这武器是很有力量的，’他写道，‘没有什么比意识到罪恶已被发现，已经对它发出过笑声更能使罪恶失去力量了。’”（译文见“文艺报”本年第十四期）
    对于这一种译文，读者会相信，译者在翻译以前，是弄清楚了原文的意思的。至于前一种译文，它会使读者怀疑：究竟译者自己弄懂了谢德林的话没有？
    在同一篇译文里，还有这样一句话：
    “苏联各族人民，如塔什克人、阿捷尔拜疆人、格鲁吉亚人的几世纪的文学是丰富的，然而直到第一次作家代表大会召开以前，文学中才有诗歌。”
    这句话是什么意思呢？前半句说，这些民族有悠久的丰富的文学传统；可是后半句却说，直到第一次作家代表大会召开以前，这些民族才有诗歌！如果真是这样，这些民族的古老的文学又是些什么？
    另一种译文是这样的：
    “像塔吉克斯坦（中略）这些苏联民族的历史悠久的文学，是十分丰富的，但在第一次作家代表大会时期，就连这些民族的文学，也主要是诗。”
  （见同期“文艺报”）
    虽然这一译文也有不对的地方（如：不能说是“在……大会时期”，不能把民族名称译成地名。），但基本上已经使人看得懂，就是说，过去那些民族的文学，主要还只是诗歌。现在呢？——下面接着说，现在，小说和剧本也产生了。这样不是很清楚了吗？
    更使人糊涂的是“学习译丛”的这篇译文中关于批判资产阶级批评家诬蔑苏联作家的几段话。原文的基本内容是：那些批评家装模作样地说，苏联作家应该“说真心话”，不应该“不真诚”，不应该“宣传”，不应该“说教”。译文是这样的：
    “资产阶级的批评家断言，如果作家想作一个虔诚的人，他就应该忏悔，而不应该宣传。他们究竟是怎样理解忏悔的呢？反动的资产阶级艺术家竭力把自己的灵魂翻一个面，把这个灵魂的一切肮脏之处都暴露出来，（中略）他们竟认为描写这类有害的行为，就是遵守了艺术中虔诚的原则！
    “这些先生们不知道，也不想知道真正的、高度的虔诚，……”
    什么是“忏悔”和“虔诚”呢？什么是“艺术中的虔诚的原则”呢？
      “文艺报”的译文是比较看得懂的：
      “资产阶级的批评家要让人相信，如果作家的意愿是真挚的，那他就该写出心腹话，而不是说教。他们这个心腹话是指什么说的呢？反动的资产阶级艺术家竭力要把自己的心灵翻一个个儿，把这颗心上的每个肮脏的角落都赤裸裸地打开，（中略）描写这种丑恶下流的事，他们认为就是遵守艺术中的‘真挚性’这个原则！……”
    原文在这段话以后，引用了普希金、莱蒙托夫等诗人的宣传真理、号召人类前进的诗句。作者说，谁都会承认这些诗句是有高度诗意的。作者问道，这些诗句究竟是真心的话呢？还是说教呢？应该说，它们既是真心话，也是说教。
    可是“学习译丛”的译文却继续纠缠在一长串的“虔诚”和“忏悔”的乱麻里：“这是什么呢？是忏悔还是宣传呢？又是忏悔，又是宣传！”“资产阶级的艺术家口头上否认宣传，提倡忏悔……”
    普希金、莱蒙托夫的那些响亮有力的诗句怎么能说是“忏悔”呢？
    “学习译丛”的这篇译文里，还有其他不少译得不清楚和不确当的词句，这里不再一一列举。
    “文艺报”的译文比较好一些，但也有它的缺点和不正确的地方。而且更不能容许的是，译者竟不止一次地漏译了一些词句，甚至删去了整个段落。作者在原文中列举了今天世界重要进步作家的一些名字，不知道译者为什么竟删去了亚马多和德永直两个人。
    这两个杂志都是全国性的刊物。“学习译丛”更是一个专门译载理论著述的刊物，它经常选译一些重要的文学评论，是受到文艺界的欢迎的。但这篇文章的译者所表现出来的那种“不求甚解”的翻译态度是不好的。
    为了对读者负责，对重要的学术论著负责，译者在动笔之前，自己首先要彻底弄清楚原文的意义，这样才有可能使原意确切地表达出来。翻译某一方面的文字，就应该努力掌握某一方面的业务知识。翻译文艺理论，就应该加强自己的文艺理论修养。
    经验和修养都还不足的青年翻译工作者的辛勤努力，是值得称赞的。他们的能力是会逐步提高的，只要他们实事求是，虚心地加强学习，改进工作。
    文学翻译工作是重要的思想工作之一。在适当的报刊上开展翻译工作的批评和自我批评，将有助于文学翻译工作的提高和进一步的发展。
