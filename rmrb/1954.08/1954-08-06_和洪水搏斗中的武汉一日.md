    A Day in Wuhan Battling the Flood
    Xinhua News Agency reporter
    August 4th was another rare sunny day in Wuhan City this summer.
    When the morning sun shone on the tall clock tower of the Wuhan Customs House, the scale outside the dike, nearly submerged by the rushing river, told people: The Yangtze River water level at the Wuhan Customs had exceeded 29 meters. On the same day in 1931, when the Yangtze River water level at the Wuhan Customs (formerly Jianghan Customs) was only 27.20 meters, Wuhan City had already been submerged in the Yangtze River flood. This year, the people of Wuhan have been fighting the flood for more than a month, and they are still bravely and victoriously continuing the battle.
    The trucks carrying earth, busy all night, stirred up the dust that had just been dried by the sun, rushing back and forth on the streets. According to the decision of the Wuhan City Flood Control Headquarters, the third phase of the dike heightening and reinforcement project could be completed on the 4th, and the fourth phase of the project would begin at the same time.
    The Wuhan City Flood Control Headquarters, which worked all night, was always very tense before dawn every day. On the morning of the 4th, the meeting of the headquarters ended at 3:00 AM. Throughout the morning, the office's telephones were in constant contact with the dikes in the three towns of Wuhan, conveying new orders and directing the city's 100,000-strong flood control army in the battle against the flood that was currently above 29 meters. At 9:00 AM on the 4th, after a short rest, the responsible cadres of the headquarters, along with engineering technicians, went to the dikes again. Only the office of the chief engineer in the entire headquarters was relatively quiet, where the elderly engineers were carefully studying effective solutions to the problem of dike slope instability.
    The more than 100 kilometers of dikes defending the three towns of Wuhan are already as high as city walls, and the labor army for flood control is continuing to add sacks of earth, one by one, and the sound of ramming earth is deafening. The flood outside the dike had already silently submerged the sacks that had been added a few days ago. The ground inside the dike is already about two meters lower than the water surface, but people are working calmly, guarding and patrolling vigilantly. The loudspeakers on the dike are constantly broadcasting songs of慰问 to these meritorious, sweating people.
    On Zhanggong Dike in the northern suburbs of Hankou, more than 300 water pumps are constantly draining the accumulated rain inside the dike. Inside the dike, the lush rice fields in the Gushushu area, the mid-season rice is already very luxuriant.
    In the midst of the intense flood control struggle, the daily life of the people of Wuhan City began as usual.
    At 6:00 AM on the 4th, the morning sun still shrouded the Yangtze River. The "Minzu" ship sounded its whistle, fully loaded with industrial raw materials from Shanghai, and set sail from Hankou Port to Yichang. At the wharves along the Yangtze River in Hankou, the stevedores raised the gangplanks again, crossed the embankments along the river, which were nearly 30 meters high, and busily loaded and unloaded industrial coal, cotton, cotton yarn, flour, rice, and flood control steel plates, sleepers, and stones. The fuel needed for Wuhan City's powerful electricity supply is unloaded here and has never been interrupted for a single day. In the spacious state-owned waiting rooms and ticket offices by the river, passengers waited to board the comfortable "Jiangming" ship to Shanghai early on the 5th.
    The train ferry connecting the two banks of the Yangtze River was temporarily interrupted due to the high water level of the Yangtze River. But the railway workers are determined to overcome the flood and are working overnight to raise the approach bridges of the ferry on both sides; the approach bridge and track laying project on the north bank of the Yangtze River is about to be completed.
    The staff of the Hankou Xunlimen Station of the Beijing-Hankou Railway told reporters: The workers unloaded the flood control materials, buckwheat seeds, kerosene, gasoline, diesel, textile machinery, etc., which were transported from North China, Northeast China, and Henan on the 3rd, early in the morning of the 4th. The buckwheat seeds are waiting to be transported to rural areas in Hubei and Jiangxi.
    At the construction site of the Hanshui Railway Bridge, workers are busy preparing to erect the trusses. At 10:00 AM on the 4th, carpenter Xie Lizhi and the ten workers in his group completed the arrangement of the wooden beams on the No. 4 pier ahead of schedule. Technicians are using tape measures to measure the nearby dikes, preparing to further reinforce the nearby dikes.
    Although the flood outside the dike is as high as the skylights of the factory buildings. The workers of the state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, protected by the newly built dike, are still persisting in production and busy inspecting the finished products. They want to strive to ship out the cotton yarn that exceeded the state plan in July in a timely manner, and strive to complete the production plan for August. The Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory is also striving to complete the August plan on the basis of exceeding the production plan for July. Old worker Bi Cailing in the locomotive workshop successfully tested a multi-tool cutting method when making cylinders, which can shorten the time to machine a cylinder by two hours. Jiang Zhiyan in the forging workshop improved the forging operation process and fully utilized the efficiency of the baking furnace, increasing the production of equalizer beams from one every three days to two every two and a half days. From the 1st to the 4th, they completed the daily plan every day.
    The Central South Region Construction Engineering Advanced Experience Observation and Promotion Conference, which has been exhibited for more than a month, continued to be exhibited in Wuhan City on the 4th. On the morning of the 4th, representatives of construction workers from Hunan, Guangxi, and the remote Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region learned advanced technologies at the conference's performance venue. The advanced woodworking group of the Guangzhou Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau also explained the semi-mechanized door and window assembly line operation method to the representatives of construction workers from Guangxi Province. More than 350 representatives of the third batch of representatives who came to study from various provinces and cities in the Central South Region left Wuhan City for their work posts on the 4th. They walked out of the venue in groups, carrying small tools and models.
    On the morning of the 4th, Dai Lunyan, associate professor of the Department of Biology of Wuhan University at Luojia Mountain, and teaching assistant Li Qingyi, at the request of the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association, dissected the roots of翻白草 and苍术 (used to treat dysentery) in the plant laboratory of the Department of Biology. In the afternoon, Dai Lunyan continued to write the book "Leaves and Photosynthesis" commissioned by the China Youth Publishing House at home. That afternoon, Wuhan University also held a tea party, where President Li Da and professors from the Department of Law talked about teaching work issues. The latest three boxes of photometer parts shipped from the Soviet Union arrived at Wuhan University on the 2nd. On the 4th, Zhong Xinghou, professor of the Department of Chemistry of Wuhan University, and teachers from the Physical Chemistry Teaching and Research Group had begun installation. On the 4th, the main concrete works of the first and second laboratory buildings under construction at the Huazhong Institute of Technology on Yujia Mountain have been completed, and eleven faculty and staff residences are being plastered, painted, and installed with glass. The autumn entrance examination held by various middle schools in Wuhan City had more applicants than in previous years, with a total of more than 5,400 students.
    On the 4th, the customers of the Central Department Store of the Wuhan City Company of China Department Store remained the same. On the bustling Zhongshan Avenue Central, the Yong'an Vegetable Market run by the Wuhan City Cooperative was filled with vegetables, dried vegetables, and fish and meat under the shed that could accommodate thousands of people. There were Hanchuan winter melons, Jiujiang potatoes, Taiyuan Baotou cabbages, Henan eggplants and kidney beans on the vegetable racks. Old resident Xu Fushou, who lives next to the Yong'an Vegetable Market, bought a few catties of Yangtze eels and vegetables. He said with a smile: "During the great flood in Hankou in the 20th year of the Republic of China, where could you buy vegetables?"
    The 5th is the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. On the 4th, both the Wuhan Peking Opera Theater and the Chu Opera Theater performed "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl." The cinemas were showing movies such as "People on the Grassland" and the Soviet film "Sadko."
    In the past few days, twenty-six babies have been born in the obstetrics department of Hankou Xiehe Hospital. These babies are living a peaceful and happy life under the care of obstetricians and nurses. In a nursery on Chezhan Road, the nursery teachers are caring for the growing children as usual. For the safety of the children, the nursery has moved the children's dormitory upstairs.
    Wuhan City will soon convene the first session of the first People's Congress meeting. The Wuhan Municipal People's Government is preparing the government work report and more than 8,600 proposals put forward by the people, and is preparing for the layout of the conference venue. The Wuhan City Art Working Team has prepared a magnificent archway for the entrance of the venue. The 4th was Wednesday, and various agencies in Wuhan City were discussing the draft constitution. Some agencies are conveying the report on the draft constitution made by Wu Defeng, Secretary-General of the Political and Legal Committee of the Central South Administrative Committee, on the 3rd.
    In the battle against the high water level of more than 29 meters of the Yangtze River, the people of Wuhan City are confidently and calmly carrying out their respective work and arranging their daily lives as usual. In order to prevent sudden changes in the flood, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government and the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China are actively leading the flood control army to continue to reinforce the dikes, while also inspecting and investigating high buildings and safe areas to be prepared for any eventuality.

    和洪水搏斗中的武汉一日
    新华社记者
    八月四日是今年夏天武汉市的又一个稀有的晴朗的日子。
    当早晨的太阳照上武汉关高大的钟楼时，楼前堤外快被奔腾的江水淹没的标尺告诉人们：武汉关长江水位已突破二十九公尺。一九三一年的同一天，武汉关（原江汉关）长江水位才二七点二零公尺的时候，武汉市已沉没在长江洪水中。今年武汉市人民已经和洪水搏斗了一个多月了，现在仍在坚强地胜利地继续战斗着。
    通夜忙碌的运土汽车卷起刚被晒干的尘土在街上川流不息地奔驰着。根据武汉市防汛总指挥部的决定，第三期堤防加高加固工程四日就可以完成，同时第四期工程就要开始了。
    通夜办公的武汉市防汛总指挥部每天在晨曦到来前总是很紧张的。四日早上三时，总指挥部的会议就结束了。整个上午办公室的电话机和武汉三镇堤防上不间歇地联系，传达着新的命令，指挥着全市十万防汛大军和当前二十九公尺以上的洪水作战。四日上午九时，总指挥部的负责干部们经过短短休息后，又带着工程技术人员分头上堤了。整个总指挥部只有总工程师办公室比较安静，年老的工程师正在那里细心地研究有效的解决堤防脱坦的问题。
    捍卫武汉三镇的一百多公里的大堤已经高得像城墙，防汛的劳动大军正在把一个个装土的麻包继续加上去，打硪的劳动声响成一片。堤外的洪水早已不声不响地把前些日子加上去的麻包淹着了。堤内地面已低于水面两公尺左右，然而人们沉着地劳动着，机警地守卫着、巡逻着。堤上的扩音器不停地向这些有功的、汗流浃背的人们播送着慰问的歌声。
    汉口北郊张公堤上，三百多部抽水机在不停地排泄着堤内的积雨。堤内姑嫂树一带的青葱的稻田，中稻已经非常繁茂了。
    在紧张的防汛斗争中的武汉市人民，一天的生活又照常开始了。
    四日上午六时，晨曦还笼罩着长江，“民族”轮汽笛长鸣，满载着来自上海的工业原料，从汉口港起锚驶往宜昌。汉口沿江一带码头上，搬运工人们再度加高了跳板，跨过标高将近三十公尺的沿江大堤，忙碌地装卸着工业用煤、棉花、棉纱、面粉、大米和防汛用的钢板、枕木、石块等。武汉市强大电力所需要的燃料，都是从这里起卸，从没有间断过一天。江边宽敞的国营候船室里和售票房前，旅客们伫候着，他们将在五日清早搭乘舒适的
  “江明”轮去上海。
    连接长江两岸的列车轮渡，因为长江的高水位暂时中断了。但铁路工人要战胜洪水，正连夜加高两岸的轮渡引桥；长江北岸的引桥、铺轨工程就要完工了。
    京汉铁路汉口循礼门车站的工作人员告诉记者：工人们四日一大早就卸完了三日从华北、东北、河南等地运来的防汛材料和荞麦种籽、煤油、汽油、柴油、纺织机械等，荞麦种籽正等待运往湖北、江西农村。
    在汉水铁桥工地上，工人正忙着准备架设桁梁。四日上午十点钟，木工谢立志和小组里的十个工人，提前完成了四号桥墩上木梁的安排工作。技术人员们正在用皮尺测量附近的堤防，准备把附近堤防进一步加固。
    虽然堤外洪水和厂房的天窗一样高了。在新筑堤防保卫下的国营武汉第一棉纺织厂的工人们，仍在坚持生产并忙碌地检查成品。他们要争取及时地把七月份超额完成国家计划的棉纱运出去，并争取完成八月份的生产计划。江岸机车车辆修理工厂也在超额完成了七月份的生产计划的基础上，争取完成八月份的计划。机车车间老工人毕才令在做汽缸时试验成功了一种多刀切削的方法，车一个汽缸就可以缩短二个小时。锻工车间的蒋智言，改进锻压的操作过程，充分发挥烘炉的效能，由三天打一根均衡梁，提高到二天半打二根。从一日到四日，他们每天都完成了日计划。
    已经展览了一个多月的中南区建筑工程先进经验观摩推广大会，四日仍在武汉市继续展览。四日上午，来自湖南、广西和遥远的内蒙古自治区的建筑工人代表们在大会的表演场上学习先进技术。广州市建筑工程局的先进木工小组还为广西省建筑工人代表讲解了半机械化门窗流水作业法。中南区各省市来学习的第三批代表三百五十多人，四日就要离开武汉市返回自己的工作岗位，他们一群群地手提着小巧的工具和模型，走出了会场。
    四日上午，珞珈山武汉大学生物系副教授戴伦焰和助教李清义应中国药学会武汉分会的要求，在生物系植物实验室解剖了翻白草和苍术（治痢疾用）的根部。下午戴伦焰在家中继续撰写为中国青年出版社预约的“叶与光合作用”一书。当天下午武汉大学还举行了一个茶话会，校长李达和法律系教授们漫谈教学工作问题。从苏联运来的最新式的三箱光度计零件已在二日运到了武汉大学。四日，武汉大学化学系教授锺兴厚和物理化学教研组教师已开始安装。四日，喻家山华中工学院正在修建的第一和第二两座实验室大楼的主要混凝土工程已经完成，教工住宅已有十一栋正在粉刷油漆和安装玻璃。武汉市各中学举行的秋季入学考试，投考学生比往年多，共有五千四百多名。
    四日，中国百货公司武汉市公司中心门市部顾客依然如故。繁华的中山大道中，武汉市合作社所办的永安菜市场，在可容千人的货棚下边，摆满了蔬菜、干菜和鱼肉。菜架上有汉川的东瓜、九江的洋芋，太原的包头白菜，河南的茄子和云豆。住在永安菜市旁的老居民许福寿老大娘买了几斤江鳝鱼和蔬菜，他笑着说：“民国二十年汉口淹大水时，那里还买得到菜啊。”
    五日是夏历七月七日，四日武汉京剧院和楚剧院都上演了“牛郎织女”。电影院在上映“草原上的人们”和苏联片“萨特阔”等影片。
    几天以来，汉口协和医院产妇科出生了二十六个婴儿。这些婴儿在产科大夫和护士们照料下，安静地过着初生的幸福生活。在车站路的一个托儿所里，保育员们和往日一样，关心地抚育着渐渐长大起来的孩子。为了孩子们的安全，这个托儿所已经把孩子们的宿舍搬到了楼上。
    武汉市不日就要召开第一届第一次人民代表大会会议，武汉市人民政府正准备政府工作报告和人民群众提出的八千六百多条提案，并准备大会会场的布置。武汉市的美术工作队已为会场大门口准备好了华丽的彩牌。四日是星期三，武汉市各机关都在讨论宪法草案。有的机关正在传达中南行政委员会政治法律委员会秘书长吴德峰三日所作的关于宪法草案的报告。
    在和长江二十九公尺以上的高水位搏斗中，武汉市人民满怀信心地沉着地照常进行各自的工作，安排每天自己的生活。为了预防洪水突然变化，武汉市人民政府和中共武汉市委员会在积极领导防汛大军继续加固堤防的同时，也视察和调查了高的楼房和安全区，使之有备无患。
