Peaceful Coexistence and the Policy of Strength Are Incompatible
Li Jian

A significant characteristic of the current international situation is the growing number of people worldwide who favor peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, while the "policy of strength" advocated by the American aggressive bloc, which creates animosity and suspicion among nations, is becoming increasingly unpopular.

This situation greatly disturbs those who are striving to promote the policy of strength and cobbling together various hostile military blocs. To mislead peace-loving people and drag them into the traps set by the American aggressive bloc, these supporters of the policy of strength are engaged in an arduous task: forcibly linking the two diametrically opposed concepts of peaceful coexistence and the policy of strength. They are trying to convince people that peaceful coexistence and the "policy of strength" are not contradictory. Specifically, only by organizing a Southeast Asian military bloc against China according to Washington's intentions can Asian countries achieve peaceful coexistence.

According to this logic, if someone wakes up one morning to find a group of heavily armed people surrounding the gates of their residence, they can rest assured because this is supposedly peaceful coexistence. However, it is not difficult to understand that unless this person is prepared to open the door to welcome the robbers, they will find it difficult to tolerate this form of peaceful coexistence.

Clearly, the policy of strength has nothing in common with peaceful coexistence. In international relations, the policy of strength is a policy of aggression. History tells us that all governments preparing for wars of aggression implement the policy of strength. The purpose of implementing the policy of strength is to impose one's will on the other party with military force as a backing. To achieve this goal, the means used will inevitably be threats, coercion, and even war. Under the policy of strength, the first to suffer are the weaker countries. They either become victims of the policy of strength or are forced to submit to aggressive great powers, becoming tools for these great powers to carry out aggression. The events in Guatemala and the slogan of "using Asians to fight Asians" shouted by the American aggressive bloc fully illustrate this truth.

The facts of international relations since World War II provide the clearest illustration of the policy of strength. Some countries, led by the United States, have refused to achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, as consistently advocated by the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies. They have implemented the policy of strength, busily setting up a network of military bases and organizing military blocs around the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. As a result, international relations have become very tense, filled with an atmosphere of hostility and distrust. Of course, there is no chance of success in implementing this policy of strength against China and the Soviet Union, as well as the People's Democracies. On the contrary, the advocates of the policy of strength have suffered a series of disastrous failures in Korea, Indochina, and at the recent Geneva Conference. They have not only failed to establish the position of strength they originally envisioned, but their position has been greatly weakened as a result of implementing the policy of strength. And those countries that have followed this policy of strength have suffered greatly. It is precisely the failures of the strongmen and the weakening of their position that have eased the international situation and created favorable prospects for peaceful coexistence.

However, the American aggressive bloc is not reconciled. They continue to pursue the policy of strength, attempting to create new tensions. The Southeast Asian military bloc is a product of this policy. The United States and its chorus are trying to disguise the Southeast Asian military bloc with the so-called "containment" of China's "threat of aggression," but this is a waste of effort because the "threat" to be "contained" simply does not exist. The real threat is the American threat of aggression against China, the American threat to peace and security in Asia. The Southeast Asian military bloc is an important link in the "crescent-shaped military alliance" surrounding China, as described by US Vice President Nixon. Russell, a reporter for the "New York Herald Tribune," openly admitted on August 14 that the main hostile target of the Southeast Asian military bloc is China. He said: "According to American officials, the main purpose of the Southeast Asia Treaty is to... warn Communist China... other countries must assume obligations in the treaty and conduct this war with the United States..."

The United States' organization of the Southeast Asian military bloc not only shows that it intends to be hostile to China for a long time, but also that it wants to obstruct peaceful coexistence between Asian countries and China. When the US air and naval forces are conducting provocations in China's territorial waters and airspace, displaying so-called "strength," and when the American aggressive bloc is unscrupulously clamoring to accelerate the completion of the "steel ring" surrounding China, it is becoming increasingly clear that the policy of strength will lead not to peaceful coexistence but to the threat of war. Following the United States' policy of strength and joining the Southeast Asian military bloc means hitching oneself to the war chariot of the American aggressors.

To achieve peaceful coexistence, what is needed is not, and cannot be, the policy of strength. To achieve peaceful coexistence, what is needed first and foremost is a sincere desire for peaceful coexistence. With this sincere desire, the establishment and development of normal diplomatic relations, and the carrying out of mutual economic and cultural exchanges on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence listed in the joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Burma, can lay a solid foundation for peaceful coexistence between large and small countries with different social systems. To have peaceful coexistence, we must oppose the policy of strength and oppose the organization of the Southeast Asian military bloc and all kinds of other military blocs. From the fact that major Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon have refused to participate in the Southeast Asian military bloc, it can be seen that more and more countries are recognizing and adhering to this principle.

### 和平共处和实力政策不能相容

    和平共处和实力政策不能相容
    李坚
    当前国际局势中的一个重要的特点是，世界上赞成不同社会制度的国家和平共处的人越来越多，而美国侵略集团所坚持的在各国之间制造敌对和猜疑的所谓实力政策日益不得人心。
    这种情况使那些竭力鼓吹实力政策、拼凑各种各样的敌对军事集团的人大为不安了。为了把爱好和平的人民引上歧途，拖进美国侵略集团所设下的圈套，这些实力政策的支持者正在做着一件费劲的工作：把和平共处和实力政策这两个截然相反的概念硬拉到一起。他们企图使人相信：和平共处与
  “实力政策”是并不矛盾的。具体说来，只有按照华盛顿的意图，组织起了针对中国的东南亚军事集团，亚洲国家才能和平共处。
    照这样说来，如果有谁在一天早上醒来，发现一伙武装到牙齿的人包围了他住所的大门，他也尽可以心安理得，因为据说这就是所谓和平共处。但是，不难理解，除非这位先生准备开门揖盗，他将很难容忍这种方式的和平共处。
    很明显，实力政策与和平共处毫无共同之点。在国际关系中，实力政策就是侵略的政策。历史告诉人们，所有准备侵略战争的政府都是实行实力政策的。实行实力政策，为的是要以武力为后盾，把自己的意志强加于对方。为了达到这个目的，使用的手段就必然是威胁、逼迫以至战争。在实力政策下面，倒霉的首先是那些较为弱小的国家。它们不是成为实力政策的牺牲对象，就是被迫屈从于侵略性的大国，成为这些大国进行侵略的工具。危地马拉的事件以及美国侵略集团所叫喊的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的口号，就充分说明了这一真理。
    第二次世界大战以后国际关系中的事实提供了关于实力政策的最清楚的说明。以美国为首的一些国家，拒绝像苏联、中国和人民民主国家所一贯主张的那样，实现不同社会制度的国家间的和平共处。它们实行实力政策，忙着在苏联和人民民主国家周围设立军事基地网，组织军事集团。结果就使国际关系十分紧张，充满着敌视和不信任的气氛。当然，要对中国和苏联以及人民民主国家实行这种实力政策自然是没有一点点成功的机会的。相反的，实力政策的主张者在朝鲜、印度支那，以及在最近日内瓦会议上遭到了一连串的惨重失败。他们不仅没有能建立起原来设想的实力地位，而且由于实行实力政策的结果，他们的地位大大地削弱了。而那些追随这种实力政策的国家，也吃尽了苦头。正是实力主义者所遭到的失败和他们地位的削弱，才使国际局势缓和下来，才出现了和平共处的有利前景。
    然而，美国侵略集团是不甘心的，他们继续推行实力政策，企图制造新的紧张局势。东南亚军事集团，就是这种政策下的产儿。美国及其帮腔者企图给东南亚军事集团披上所谓“遏制”中国的“侵略威胁”的伪装，然而这是白费力气的，因为要“遏制”的这种“威胁”是根本不存在的。存在的实际威胁倒是美国对中国的侵略威胁，美国对亚洲和平和安全的威胁。东南亚军事集团就是美国副总统尼克松所谓包围中国的“半月形军事联盟”中的一个重要环节。“纽约先驱论坛报”记者鲁塞尔八月十四日也公开承认东南亚军事集团的主要敌对目标是中国，他说：“按照美国官员的看法，东南亚公约的主要目的是，……警告共产党中国……其他国家要在条约中承担义务，和美国一起进行这种战争。……”
    美国组织东南亚军事集团，不仅表明它自己要长期和中国为敌，而且要阻挠亚洲国家和中国和平共处。当美国的海空军正在中国的领海和领空进行挑衅、显示所谓“实力”的时候，当美国侵略集团正在肆无忌惮地叫嚷着要加速完成包围中国的“钢圈”的时候，人们已经越来越清楚：实力政策将要导致的绝不是和平共处而是战争的威胁。追随美国的实力政策，参加东南亚军事集团，就是把自己套上了美国侵略者的战车。
    为了达到和平共处，需要的绝不是也不能是实力政策。达到和平共处，首先需要的是和平共处的真诚愿望。有了这种真诚的愿望，在中印、中缅两国总理联合声明中所列举的和平共处五项原则的基础上，建立和发展正常的外交关系，开展相互间的经济和文化的交流，就能为不同社会制度大小国家间和平共处奠定巩固的基础。要和平共处，就要反对实力政策，反对组织东南亚军事集团和其他各式各样的军事集团。从印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰等这样一些主要亚洲国家拒绝参加东南亚军事集团这个事实中，可以看到，认识和坚持这个道理的国家是越来越多了。
