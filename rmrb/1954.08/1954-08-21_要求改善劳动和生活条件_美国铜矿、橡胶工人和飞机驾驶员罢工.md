Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 20th: American copper miners, rubber workers, and airline pilots have gone on strike successively to demand improved working and living conditions.

    According to American news agencies, the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers announced that 10,000 workers at Kennecott Copper Corporation in Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico began a strike on the 16th, demanding revisions to the collective contract. This strike will reduce America's copper production by four to five hundred tons per day. In addition to this strike, 25,000 rubber workers at eight factories belonging to Firestone Tire & Rubber Company began a strike last week, protesting the capitalists' rejection of the union's reasonable demand for wage increases. Prior to this, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company workers had already gone on strike for similar reasons. Currently, the strikes in the United States have resulted in a total of approximately 50,000 rubber workers engaging in strike struggles for their own vital interests. Furthermore, according to an American news agency report on the 18th, the strike by 1,200 American Airlines pilots, which began on July 31st, is continuing. They are disregarding the capitalists' threat of dismissal and persisting in their struggle to implement an eight-hour workday.

    要求改善劳动和生活条件
    美国铜矿、橡胶工人和飞机驾驶员罢工
    【新华社二十日讯】纽约消息：美国铜矿工人、橡胶工人和飞机驾驶员为要求改善劳动和生活条件，先后举行罢工。
    据美国通讯社报道，国际开采冶炼工人工会宣布，肯奈柯特铜公司在犹他州、内华达州、亚利桑那州和新墨西哥州的一万工人在十六日开始举行罢工，要求改订集体合同。这一个罢工将使美国的铜的生产每天减少四、五百吨。除了这个罢工以外，费尔斯通轮胎橡胶公司所属的八个工厂的二万五千名橡胶工人在上周开始罢工，抗议资方拒绝工会关于提高工资的合理要求，在此以前，固特异轮胎橡胶公司工人已为了类似的理由而举行罢工。目前，在美国的罢工，就使得美国一共约有五万名橡胶工人在为了切身的利益而进行罢工斗争。又据美国通讯社十八日的消息说，从七月三十一日开始的一千二百名美洲航空公司的驾驶员的罢工仍在继续，他们不顾资方解雇的威胁，坚持争取实行八小时工作制。
