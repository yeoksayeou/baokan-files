Through the victory of socialism, the elimination of the exploiting classes, and the enormous educational work carried out by the Communist Party in the past and present among the masses, the spiritual outlook of the Soviet people has fundamentally changed, and their consciousness has been raised.

Socialist ideology has been established and occupies a dominant position in our country; and the solid foundation constituting socialist ideology is Marxism-Leninism, the scientific materialist world view. The triumph of socialist ideology is the result of the Party's many years of educational work among the masses, and its irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois ideology and the remnants of capitalism in people's minds.

However, the victory of socialist ideology does not mean that the remnants of the bourgeois world view, the remnants of private ownership ideology and morality, have been completely eliminated in our society. These remnants have not disappeared and will not disappear by themselves; it is necessary to wage a persistent and unwavering struggle against them. One of the most active and harmful remnants of capitalism in people's minds is religious prejudice. This prejudice continues to poison the consciousness of some of our people, hindering them from actively participating in the construction of communism.

Propagating the materialist world view, natural science knowledge, and struggling against various prejudices and superstitions is an important part of our Party's enormous work in carrying out communist education for the working people and overcoming the remnants of bourgeois ideology. V.I. Lenin wrote in "Socialism and Religion" that the Party, as a union of conscious and advanced fighters, cannot and should not "ignore ignorance, obscurantism, or dark forces appearing in the form of religious belief."

Soviet socialist democracy ensures genuine freedom of belief without any restrictions, which no capitalist country has or can have. Article 124 of the Soviet Constitution stipulates: "In order to ensure freedom of conscience for citizens, the church is separated from the state and the school from the church in the USSR. All citizens are guaranteed freedom of religious worship or freedom of anti-religious propaganda."

The Communist Party and the Soviet state have consistently implemented the provisions of the Soviet Constitution regarding freedom of belief. However, some Party, trade union, youth league, and other organizations, in this mission of carrying out educational work among the masses, for some reason understand freedom of belief only as the freedom to spread religious views; and forget their duty to educate the working masses and to carry out scientific atheistic propaganda. And what does it mean if they do not fulfill this duty and cancel scientific atheistic propaganda? This means canceling the struggle between science and superstition, the struggle between light and darkness. It is precisely because of this passive and "neutral" attitude held by many organizations that the propaganda of scientific atheistic knowledge has been weakened in recent times. It is being carried out particularly poorly among rural residents, and in many cases, this propaganda lacks a combative, forward-looking nature and is divorced from life.

Serious shortcomings in scientific atheistic propaganda are due to the fact that some Party organizations have not recognized the extreme importance of fully strengthening communist education for the working people and consistently struggling against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds. In many cases, they adopt a conciliatory attitude towards those who spread various prejudices and superstitions that spiritually cripple and humiliate the Soviet people.

Resolutely implementing measures to ensure the further improvement of the cultural level of the working people, widely disseminating natural science knowledge, and explaining the achievements of Soviet science, technology, and culture – these are the ways to form the scientific, atheistic world view of the Soviet people. In carrying out scientific atheistic propaganda, one should not hurt the feelings of believers, but should influence them with examples, persuasion, and the method of publicizing scientific knowledge.

Our schools play a major role in the work of educating the growing generation of Soviet people with truly scientific communist ideas. The foundation of youth's scientific world view must be laid in primary and secondary schools, and a materialist world view must be formed in institutions of higher learning. However, the Ministries of Education of the various republics and the Ministry of Higher Education of the Soviet Union have not paid due attention to the problem of educating young students in the spirit of a materialist world view. They have not carried out regular work to popularize natural science knowledge. National education organs, teachers, and youth league organizations often overlook the fact that children are developing religious prejudices, and they do not consider it their direct duty to use scientific explanations of natural phenomena to launch a struggle against these prejudices.

The mission of national education organs, our glorious teaching staff, university leaders, and Party and youth league organizations is to widely carry out educational work among students in a combative materialist spirit. In the training and overall teaching process of primary and secondary schools, especially in the teaching of subjects such as history, literature, chemistry, physics, and biology, natural phenomena and social life must be explained from the standpoint of a materialist world view. In institutions of higher learning, all methods must also be adopted to strengthen the propaganda of the materialist world view.

In our country, there are widespread and increasingly expanding clubs, cultural centers and palaces, rural libraries, and other cultural and educational institutions, and their duty is to regularly and persistently promote natural science knowledge and struggle against religion and other prejudices. It must be pointed out that many cultural and educational institutions do not perform this task well, their working methods are dull, rigid, and they do not utilize the enormous possibilities they possess.

The scientific atheistic propaganda carried out by the organs under the Ministry of Culture of the Soviet Union and the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge is unsatisfactory; speeches and reports on atheistic issues are extremely few, and the number of such speeches is decreasing year by year, and the ideological and scientific level of the speeches is also very low. In many cases, trade union and youth league organizations have abandoned scientific atheistic propaganda work.

The press has done very little to promote scientific atheism. Central and local newspapers, socio-political and literary magazines have neglected this issue. Very few books and pamphlets on scientific atheism have been published; and the books that have been published also have serious shortcomings. Usually, they are divorced from the urgent task of carrying out communist education for the working people, written in an unpopular, incomprehensible, and obscure language.

It is necessary to resolutely increase the sense of responsibility of Party organizations for the state of scientific atheistic propaganda, end bureaucratic practices and rigid formulas in educational work, and use all methods to encourage and cultivate the spirit of initiative, persistence, and irreconcilability in the struggle against religious prejudices and superstitions. The Party is widely launching communist education work for the working people, and it cannot tolerate the phenomenon of neglect in scientific atheistic propaganda. The duty of Party organizations is to eliminate the shortcomings that exist in this area in the shortest possible time and to revitalize the propaganda of scientific atheism.

Our socialist society has created all the objective preconditions and possibilities for completely overcoming the remnants of capitalism in people's minds, including religious prejudices and superstitions. It is necessary to give scientific atheistic propaganda a broad, truly mass scale and resolutely improve its content.

### 更广泛地开展科学无神论的宣传  苏联“真理报”七月二十四日社论

    更广泛地开展科学无神论的宣传
    苏联“真理报”七月二十四日社论
    由于社会主义的胜利，剥削阶级的消灭和共产党过去和现在在群众中所进行的巨大教育工作，苏维埃人的精神面貌根本改变了，他们的觉悟提高了。
    社会主义思想已在我国确立并占居统治地位；而构成社会主义思想的牢固基础的，是马克思列宁主义，是科学的唯物主义世界观。社会主义思想的凯旋，是党对群众多年来教育工作的结果，是它对资产阶级思想、对人们意识中的资本主义残余作不调和的斗争的结果。
    但是，社会主义思想的胜利，并不意味着资产阶级的世界观的残余、私有制的思想和道德的残余在我们的社会中已完全消灭。这些残余并没有消灭而且也不会自己消灭的，必须对它们进行毫不减弱的顽强的斗争。在人们意识中资本主义最活跃和最有害的残余之一，就是宗教偏见。这种偏见一直到现在还毒害着我们一部分人的意识，阻碍着他们积极地参加共产主义的建设。
    宣传唯物主义的世界观、自然科学知识，对各种偏见和迷信作斗争，乃是我们党对劳动人民进行共产主义教育，克服资产阶级思想残余的巨大工作的重要组成部分。乌·伊·列宁在“社会主义与宗教”一文中写道，作为觉悟了的、先进的战士的联盟的党，不能也不应该“对以宗教信仰的形式出现的无知、愚昧或者黑暗势力熟视无睹”。
    苏维埃社会主义的民主，确保了不受任何限制的真正的信仰自由，这是任何一个资本主义国家所没有而且也不能有的。苏联宪法第一百二十四条规定：“为保证公民信仰自由计，在苏联实行政教分离及教育与宗教分离。一切公民皆能自由举行宗教仪式或进行反宗教宣传。”
    共产党和苏维埃国家，始终不渝地实行着苏联宪法关于信仰自由的规定。但是，某些党、工会、青年团和其它的组织，在对群众进行教育工作这一使命中，不知为什么把信仰自由仅仅理解为自由地散布宗教的观点；而忘记了他们的职责是教育劳动群众，展开科学无神论的宣传。而他们不履行这种职责、取消科学无神论的宣传意味着什么呢？这就是说取消了科学与迷信之间的斗争，光明与黑暗之间的斗争。正是由于不少的组织所持的这种消极的和“中立”的态度，对于科学无神论知识的宣传最近一个时期就削弱了。进行得特别不好的是在农村居民中间，在许多场合下，这些宣传缺乏战斗的、前进的性质，而且脱离了生活。
    科学无神论宣传中的严重缺点，是由于某些党的组织没有认识到全力加强对劳动人民的共产主义教育，始终不渝地同人们意识中的资本主义残余作斗争的极端重要性。在许多情况下，他们对那些散播在精神上摧残和屈辱苏联人的各种偏见和迷信的行为，采取调和主义的态度。
    坚决执行保证进一步提高劳动人民的文化水平的措施，广泛传播自然科学知识，说明苏联科学、技术和文化的成就——这些就是形成苏联人科学的、无神论世界观的途径。在展开科学无神论的宣传中，不应该伤害信教人的感情，而要用实例、说服和宣传科学知识的方法去影响他们。
    在以真正科学的共产主义思想教育正在成长着的一代苏联人的工作中，我们的学校起着重大作用。青年的科学的世界观的基础，正是要在中小学中奠定，而在高等学校则要形成唯物主义的世界观。但是，各加盟共和国教育部和苏联高等教育部，对于以唯物主义世界观的精神教育青年学生的问题，没有给予应有的注意。他们没有进行经常的普及自然科学知识的工作。国民教育机关、教师、青年团组织对儿童们养成宗教偏见的事实，时常忽视过去，他们没有认为借助对自然现象的科学解释来展开反对这些偏见的斗争，是自己的直接职责。
    国民教育机关、我们光荣的教师队伍、大学的领导者以及党和青年团组织的使命，就是要以战斗的唯物主义精神对学生广泛展开教育工作。在中小学的训练和全部教学过程中，首先是在历史、文学、化学、物理学、生物学等科目的教学工作中，要从唯物主义世界观的立场去解释自然现象和社会生活。在高等学校中，也必须采取一切方法加强唯物主义世界观的宣传。
    在我国具有广泛的日益扩大着的俱乐部、文化馆和文化宫、农村图书馆和其它文化教育机关，他们的义务就是要经常地和顽强地宣传自然科学知识，同宗教和其他偏见作斗争。必须指出，许多文化教育机关对这一任务执行得不好，他们的工作方式枯燥无味、死板，没有利用他们拥有的巨大可能性。
    苏联文化部所属机关和全苏政治和科学知识普及协会所作的科学无神论宣传，是不能令人满意的，对无神论问题的演讲和报告是极其少的，而且这种演讲的数量在逐年减少，演讲的思想科学水平也非常低。在许多情况下，工会和青年团组织放弃了科学无神论的宣传工作。
    报刊对于科学无神论的宣传作得十分不够。中央和地方报纸、社会政治和文艺杂志都把这一问题置之脑后。关于科学无神论问题的书籍和小册子出版得很少；已出版的书籍也有严重的缺点。通常，它们脱离对劳动人民进行共产主义教育的迫切任务，写得不通俗，难懂，语句艰涩。
    必须坚决地提高党组织对于科学无神论宣传状况的责任感，终结教育工作中的官僚习气和死板公式，用一切方法鼓励和培植同宗教偏见和迷信作斗争的主动精神、顽强和不调和的精神。党广泛展开着对劳动人民的共产主义教育工作，它不能容许对科学无神论宣传的无人照管的现象。党组织的职责就在于，要在最短的期间内消除掉这方面存在的缺点，使对科学无神论的宣传活跃起来。
    我们的社会主义社会，为完全克服人们意识中的资本主义残余，其中也包括宗教偏见和迷信，创造了一切客观的前提条件和可能。必须使科学无神论宣传具有广泛的、真正群众性的规模，并坚决地改进它的内容。
