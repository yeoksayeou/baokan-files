State-owned commercial departments in the Southwest region are actively organizing and transferring autumn and winter goods to welcome the peak trading season. Since the beginning of autumn, tons of general merchandise and fabrics are being transported daily from Chongqing along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway, the Yangtze River, and the Jialing River, to rural areas throughout the Southwest.

This year, the quantity and variety of autumn and winter goods prepared by the state-owned commercial departments in the Southwest region exceed those of any previous year. The Southwest Regional Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation plans to supply 300 varieties of cotton cloth of various colors this autumn and winter, with a quantity more than double the actual supply in the same period last year. The autumn and winter goods prepared by state-owned department stores in Sichuan, Yunnan, Xikang, Guizhou, and Chongqing provinces and cities are generally 50% to 200% more than in the same period last year. The volume of towels processed and purchased by the Sichuan Provincial Company of the China National Department Store Corporation in the province during the third quarter is equivalent to the total volume of towels processed and purchased throughout last year. The processing and purchase volume of socks has also increased by 31% to 50% compared to the entire previous year. The woolen fabric prepared by the Chongqing Department Store Purchasing and Supplying Station is sufficient to make 150,000 sets of clothing. The quantities of goods favored by ethnic minorities in Xikang, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, such as silk thread, brocade, satin, gauze handkerchiefs, and locally printed quilt covers, have all increased compared to previous years.

In light of the inconvenient transportation and frequent autumn rains in the Southwest region, the state-owned commercial departments in the Southwest region are transferring large quantities of autumn and winter supplies to rural areas in various provinces in advance. Sichuan Province began transferring autumn and winter goods to various sales units in early August, and most of them can be delivered by the end of August. Yunnan and Guizhou provinces began transferring autumn and winter supplies successively in the second quarter. Most of the seasonal goods purchased by various provinces and cities in the Southwest region from outside the region this year were already transported to the Southwest region in July. Currently, due to the high water level of the Yangtze River, which makes transportation difficult, some urgently needed autumn and winter goods are being rerouted from Baoji in Shaanxi and Jinchengjiang in Guangxi Province to the Southwest. Individual goods that are high in price, small in volume, and urgently needed are planned to be airlifted to ensure supply during the peak season.

    西南区国营商业部门
    积极组织和调运秋冬季商品迎接贸易旺季
    西南区国营商业部门正积极组织和调运秋冬季商品，迎接贸易旺季。入秋以来，每天都有数以千吨计的百货布匹从重庆沿着成渝铁路、川黔公路、长江和嘉陵江等主要交通干线，运往西南各地农村。
    今年，西南区国营商业部门准备的秋冬季商品，数量和品种都超过了以往任何一年。中国花纱布公司西南区公司今年秋冬季计划供应三百个品种的各色棉布，数量将比去年同期实际供应数增加一倍以上。四川、云南、西康、贵州和重庆等省、市国营百货部门准备的秋冬商品，一般比去年同期增加百分之五十到百分之二百以上。中国百货公司四川省公司第三季度在省内组织加工、采购的毛巾，相当于去年全年组织加工和采购毛巾的总和；袜子的加工、采购量，也比去年全年增加百分之三十一到百分之五十。重庆百货采购供应站准备的毛呢，足够缝制十五万套服装。西康、云南和贵州等省少数民族人民喜爱的商品，如花丝线、绸绫、花缎、纱帕和土印花被面等，准备的数量都比往年增加。
    西南区国营商业部门根据该区交通不便和秋季多雨等情况，把大批秋冬季物资提前往各省农村调运。四川省从八月初起开始向各销售单位调运秋冬季商品，八月底大部分都可以运到。云南和贵州等省在第二季度便陆续开始调运秋冬季物资。今年西南各省、市向区外采购的节令货，大部分在七月里就已经运到西南区。目前因长江水位很高，物资运输困难，部分急需的秋冬商品正改道从陕西宝鸡和广西省金城江等地运进西南；个别价格高、体积小、需用急的物资准备空运，以保证在旺季供应。
