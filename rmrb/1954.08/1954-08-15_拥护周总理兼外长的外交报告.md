Talk by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

    Premier Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister's diplomatic report to the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, details the course and outcome of the Geneva Conference. The brilliant achievements made by Premier Zhou Enlai on behalf of our country at the Geneva Conference are particularly worthy of respect and congratulations from the people of the whole country. I, on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, express firm support and heartfelt endorsement.

    The warmongering clique in the United States, in its pursuit of world hegemony, has consistently pursued its aggressive policy of creating international tensions and implementing arms expansion and war preparations. During the Geneva Conference, it tried its best to undermine the Geneva Conference in an attempt to continue to expand international tensions. But the American warmongers suffered a serious defeat at the Geneva Conference. The achievements of the Geneva Conference have further eased international tensions. This is a victory for the policy of peace and a great victory for the democratic and peaceful camp. However, the American warmongering clique has not learned its lesson from this failure. After the Geneva Conference, it continued its increasingly bankrupt policy of strength, actively organizing the so-called Southeast Asia Defense Group, while continuing to occupy Taiwan. This is not only hostile to our 600 million people, but also seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world. We must have a high degree of vigilance and resolutely fight against it, so that the American warmongering clique's policy of strength will suffer final bankruptcy.

    Chiang Kai-shek, the public enemy of the Chinese people, and his traitorous clique, entrenched in Taiwan, under the direction and assistance of the American aggressors, harass our southeastern coastal areas, slaughter our compatriots, plunder coastal fishermen, and rob and detain ships from various countries coming to our country for trade. The American aggressors sheltered Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique to continue to occupy Taiwan as a military base for aggression against the Chinese mainland and Asia. The American aggressors and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique are planning to sign a so-called "joint security bilateral treaty." We must liberate Taiwan, because "Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory, and it will never be allowed to be occupied by the United States, nor will it be allowed to be placed under United Nations trusteeship. The liberation of Taiwan is China's sovereignty and internal affairs, and no other country is allowed to interfere." We must liberate Taiwan, because "the American aggressive clique continues to occupy Taiwan, sheltering Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique, and carrying out armed intervention, which is not only an infringement on our country's territorial sovereignty and interference in our internal affairs, but also increases the threat of war in the Far East, intensifies the international situation, and prevents China and other relevant countries from enjoying the benefits of peace." We must liberate Taiwan, and we will certainly be able to liberate Taiwan. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have liberated the Chinese mainland and won the victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. In the future, there is no doubt that they will be able to liberate Taiwan victoriously under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Our people and our country have grown up in battles. In the struggle to liberate Taiwan, we will continue to grow stronger and become a strong fortress of peace in Asia. It is the sacred task of the Chinese people to eliminate the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and restore the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. All members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang should rise up together and unite closely with the people of the whole country around the Chinese Communist Party, and actively respond to the call of the Central People's Government: "Strengthen work in all aspects, and strive to liberate Taiwan, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique, and finally complete the sacred liberation cause of our Chinese people!"

Written Talk by Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League

    I fully agree with and enthusiastically support the diplomatic report made by Premier Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. First of all, I express my sincere respect to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and to Premier Zhou's great contribution to peaceful diplomacy.

    The delegation of our country attending the Geneva Conference, due to its adherence to the policy of peaceful diplomacy and its advocacy of the five principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, finally achieved a brilliant achievement of peace defeating war at the Geneva Conference, and reached an agreement to restore peace in Indochina, ending the eight-year Indochina War. During the Geneva Conference, Premier Zhou's external activities on behalf of our country during this period demonstrated our country's willingness to seek solutions to international disputes in the spirit of peaceful consultation, and demonstrated our country's willingness to establish peaceful and cooperative relations with Asian and world countries on the basis of the five principles. The facts have fully proved that all of this can be done.

    The American aggressive clique is taking exactly the opposite path from us. They have consistently pursued a policy of strength by expanding arms and preparing for war, creating international tensions. While launching the war of aggression against Korea in June 1950, they occupied Taiwan, vainly attempting to support Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique to attack our mainland. After the failure of the war of aggression against Korea, they intensified their interference in the Indochina War. After the Geneva Conference, they stepped up their efforts to organize a Pacific military alliance aimed at opposing the People's Republic of China and took various aggressive and provocative actions. As a result, the American aggressive clique became increasingly isolated, its cold war policy of creating tensions became increasingly unpopular, and all its sabotage activities suffered disastrous defeats.

    Taiwan is Chinese territory. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Chinese people have been fighting for the recovery of Taiwan every day for fifty years. The Cairo Declaration of 1943 and the Potsdam Proclamation of 1945 both reiterated that Taiwan is Chinese territory. The American aggressive clique has betrayed its faith and disregarded the fact that it had signed the above-mentioned declarations and proclamations. Recently, it has planned to sign a so-called "joint security bilateral treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique, vainly attempting to use Taiwan as a springboard for its attack on China and further undermine peace and security in Asia and the world.

    These actions by the United States not only infringe upon China's territorial sovereignty and interfere in our internal affairs, but also undermine peace in Asia and increase the threat of war to the whole world. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people and is opposed by the governments and peoples of all peace-loving countries. As Premier Zhou said: "China has no intention of invading the territory of other countries, and will never tolerate other countries invading China's territory. ... China has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and will never tolerate other countries interfering in China's internal affairs." We must liberate Taiwan. Liberating Taiwan is to complete our country's cause of liberation, which is also to defend world peace. If the American warmongers dare to obstruct our people from liberating Taiwan, that is an infringement on our country's territory, interference in our internal affairs, and undermining world peace. It must bear the serious consequences of its own criminal acts!

    Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have already gloriously liberated the Chinese mainland. But if Taiwan is not liberated for one day, our cause of liberation cannot be considered complete. Liberating Taiwan and completing the cause of liberation of all of China is the glorious historical task of our people. I fully believe that this task will definitely be completed victoriously.

    We call on the people of the whole country to unite more firmly around the Chinese Communist Party, further promote the spirit of patriotism, strengthen production and construction, and fully support the Chinese People's Liberation Army to complete the glorious historical task of liberating Taiwan.

Written Talk by Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

    We wholeheartedly support the diplomatic report made by Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions vows to fight to the end to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan and defending world peace.

    Taiwan has always been an inseparable part of our sacred territory. This land was opened up by the Chinese people with their diligent labor. The Chinese people have waged a heroic struggle and paid a heavy price to recover this land from the Japanese aggressors. This is well known to the people of the whole world. The liberation of Taiwan is a matter for the Chinese people themselves, and no interference from American imperialism is allowed.

    The American aggressive clique has always been hostile to our People's Republic of China and has attempted to turn Taiwan into a military base for attacking our country. It vainly attempts to use Chiang Kai-shek, this corpse, as a tool to occupy Taiwan. For this purpose, American imperialism has also stuffed the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique into the United Nations to act as the so-called "Chinese representatives," and has attempted to sign a so-called "joint security bilateral treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous gang and organize a "Northeast Asia Defense League" of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek traitorous cliques.

    However, American imperialism has miscalculated. The Chinese working class and the people of the whole country will never allow American imperialism to occupy Taiwan, nor will they allow Taiwan to be handed over to United Nations trusteeship. The liberation of Taiwan is the sacred task of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country. We have sufficient strength and confidence to smash any conspiracy of American imperialism to occupy Taiwan and completely eliminate the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops.

    We, the nation's workers and staff, vow to unite more closely under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, strive to increase production, practice thrift, further carry out labor emulation drives, actively participate in the technical innovation movement, improve and consolidate labor discipline, complete and overfulfill the various targets of the production plan, accelerate the country's socialist industrialization and national defense modernization, and strive to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan and defending world peace!

    拥护周总理兼外长的外交报告
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深的谈话
    周恩来总理兼外交部部长在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上所作的外交报告中详尽地叙述了日内瓦会议的经过和结果。周恩来总理代表我国在日内瓦会议中所取得的辉煌成就是特别值得全国人民钦敬和祝贺的。我谨代表中国国民党革命委员会表示坚决的支持和衷心的拥护。
    美国的好战集团，为追求世界霸权，一贯地执行其制造国际紧张局势，实行扩军备战的侵略政策。在日内瓦会议期间，它又百般破坏日内瓦会议，企图继续扩大国际紧张局势。但美国好战分子在日内瓦会议遭到了严重的失败。日内瓦会议的成就使国际紧张局势得到进一步的缓和，这是和平政策的胜利，是民主和平阵营的伟大胜利。然而美国好战集团在这次失败中并未得到教训，它在日内瓦会议之后，仍然继续其日益破产的实力政策，积极组织所谓东南亚防御集团，同时继续霸占台湾。这不仅是与我国六万万人民为敌，并且严重威胁亚洲和世界和平。我们必须有高度的警惕，与之作坚决斗争，使美国好战集团的实力政策遭到最后的破产。
    盘据台湾的中国人民公敌蒋介石和他的卖国集团，在美国侵略者的指使和援助之下，对我国东南沿海地区进行骚扰，屠杀我国同胞，劫掠沿海渔民，并劫掠和扣留各国前来我国通商的船舶。美国侵略者庇护蒋介石卖国集团继续侵占台湾，作为侵略中国大陆和亚洲的军事基地，美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团正在策划订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”。我们必须解放台湾，因为“台湾是中国神圣不可侵犯的领土，决不容许美国侵占，也决不容许交给联合国托管。解放台湾是中国的主权和内政，决不容许他国干涉。”我们必须解放台湾，因为“美国侵略集团继续侵占台湾，庇护蒋介石卖国集团，进行武装干涉，不仅是侵犯我国领土主权，干涉我国内政，而且是增加远东战争威胁，紧张国际局势，使中国和其他有关国家不能享受和平利益。”我们必须解放台湾，我们一定能够解放台湾，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，已经解放了中国大陆，赢得了抗美援朝的胜利，今后也毫无疑义地能够在中国共产党和毛主席领导下胜利地解放台湾。我国人民和我们的国家是在战斗中成长起来的，我们在解放台湾的斗争中更将不断壮大起来，成为亚洲的坚强的和平堡垒。消灭卖国贼蒋介石和恢复中国的领土主权的完整是中国人民的神圣任务。中国国民党革命委员会全体成员应一致奋起和全国人民一道紧密地团结在中国共产党周围，积极响应中央人民政府的号召：“从各方面加强工作，为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团、以最后完成我中国人民的神圣解放事业而奋斗！”
    中国民主同盟主席张澜的书面谈话
    对于周恩来总理兼外交部部长在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上的外交报告，我完全同意并热诚拥护。首先，对于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，和周总理对于和平外交的巨大贡献，我表示衷诚的敬意。
    出席日内瓦会议的我国代表团由于坚持和平外交政策，主张互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则，终于在日内瓦会议中取得了和平战胜战争的辉煌成就，达成了印度支那恢复和平的协议，结束了已打了八年的印度支那战争。在日内瓦会议期间，周总理代表我国在这一时期所作的对外活动，说明了我国愿以和平协商的精神来谋求国际争端的解决，说明了我国愿以五项原则为基础与亚洲及世界各国建立和平合作的关系，而事实也完全证明了这一切是可以作到的。
    美国侵略集团和我们走的正是相反的道路，他们一贯执行的是扩军备战的实力政策，在国际间制造紧张局势，于一九五○年六月发动侵朝战争的同时，就侵占了台湾，妄想支持蒋介石卖国集团进攻我大陆。侵朝战争失败后他们就加紧干涉印度支那战争；在日内瓦会议以后，又加紧策划组织以反对中华人民共和国为目的的太平洋军事同盟，并采取各种的侵略挑衅行为。其结果是使美国侵略集团日益孤立，它的制造紧张局势的冷战政策，日益不得人心，它的一切阴谋破坏活动都遭受到惨败。
    台湾是中国的领土，甲午战争以后，五十年来，中国人民没有一天不在为收复台湾而奋斗。一九四三年开罗宣言，一九四五年波茨坦公告，都曾经重申台湾为中国领土。美国侵略集团竟背信弃义不顾它曾在上述宣言、公告中签字的事实，最近又策划与蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同安全双边条约”，妄想把台湾作为它进攻中国的跳板，进一步的破坏亚洲和世界的和平与安全。
    美国这些行为，不只是侵犯了中国领土主权，干涉我国内政，并且破坏了亚洲和平，增加了对全世界的战争威胁。这是中国人民绝对不能容许的，也是爱好和平的各国政府和人民所反对的。正如周总理所说：“中国没有侵略别国领土的意图，也决不容忍别国侵略中国的领土。……中国没有干涉别国内政的意图，也决不容忍别国干涉中国的内政。”我们一定要解放台湾。解放台湾是为了完成我国的解放事业，也就是保卫世界的和平。如果美国好战分子敢于阻挡我国人民解放台湾，那就是侵犯我国领土，干涉我国内政，破坏世界和平，它就要承担它自己的罪恶行为的严重的后果！
    在中国共产党和毛主席英明领导之下，我们早已光荣地解放了中国大陆。但是台湾一日不解放，我们的解放事业就不能算是完成。解放台湾，完成全中国解放事业，是我全国人民的光荣历史任务。我完全相信这一任务是一定会胜利地完成的。
    我们号召全国人民更牢固地团结在中国共产党的周围，更进一步地发扬爱国主义精神，加强生产建设，全力支援中国人民解放军以完成解放台湾的光荣历史任务。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚的书面谈话
    我们衷心地拥护中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来同志在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上的外交报告。中华全国总工会誓为完成解放台湾、保卫世界和平的光荣任务而奋斗到底。
    台湾从来就是我国神圣领土的一部分，这块土地是中国人民用辛勤的劳动开辟出来的，中国人民为了从日本侵略者手中收复这块土地，曾经进行过英勇的斗争，付出了重大的代价，这是全世界人民所周知的。解放台湾是中国人民自己的事，绝不容许美帝国主义来干涉。
    美国侵略集团一向敌视我中华人民共和国，企图把台湾变成进攻我国的军事基地，它妄图以蒋介石这个僵尸做工具，来霸占台湾。为了这个目的，美帝国主义还把蒋介石卖国集团的代表硬塞在联合国里充当所谓“中国代表”，并企图和蒋介石卖国匪帮订立什么“共同安全双边条约”，组织李承晚、蒋介石卖国集团的“东北亚防御联盟”。
    然而美帝国主义却打错了算盘。中国工人阶级和全国人民决不容许美帝国主义侵占台湾，也决不容许将台湾交给联合国托管。解放台湾是中国工人阶级和全国人民的神圣任务，我们有足够的力量和信心来粉碎美帝国主义侵占台湾的任何阴谋，把残余的蒋介石匪军彻底消灭。
    我们全国职工誓在中央人民政府和中国共产党的领导下，更加紧密地团结起来，努力增加生产、厉行节约，进一步开展劳动竞赛，积极参加技术革新运动，提高和巩固劳动纪律，完成和超额完成生产计划的各项指标，加速国家的社会主义工业化和国防现代化，为完成解放台湾、保卫世界和平的光荣任务而奋斗到底！
