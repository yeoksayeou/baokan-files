    Central Higher Education Ministry Selects Over Two Thousand Five Hundred Students to Study Abroad
    In order to cultivate faculty for institutions of higher education, senior technicians, and scientific research talent, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government selected over two thousand five hundred and sixty students this summer to study in the Soviet Union, various People's Democratic countries in Eastern Europe, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Among them, one hundred and forty-three students going to the People's Democratic countries have been concentrating on their studies for more than a month and will soon be leaving the country. The students going to the Soviet Union will study Russian and political theory in China for one year and will leave the country next summer.
    This year's students selected from all over the country include first-year university students, teaching assistants, graduate students, high school students, students from worker-peasant rapid courses, and a small number of cadres from government organs. Their political quality, academic performance, and health are all good. More than 92% of them are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Liu Wenpu, a first-year "worker-peasant class" student in the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing at Tsinghua University, used to be an apprentice in the locomotive workshop of a railway factory. Now that he has been selected as a student to study abroad, he feels extremely excited and honored. He said: "I am confident that I will complete the glorious task assigned to me by the people of the motherland and cultivate myself to become a intellectual of the working class." Yang Guangwen, a student at the worker-peasant rapid course attached to Tsinghua University, used to be a poor child who collected firewood. After being selected as a student to study abroad, he excitedly said: "This is as beautiful as a dream!" Yang Guangwen is determined to study hard and strive to be a red engineer who is loyal to the Party and the socialist cause of the motherland.

    中央高等教育部选拔二千五百多名留学生
    为培养高等学校师资、高级技术人员和科学研究人材，中央人民政府高等教育部在今年暑期选拔了二千五百六十多名赴苏联、东欧各人民民主国家和蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的留学生。其中赴各人民民主国家的一百四十三名留学生已集中学习了一个多月，不久就要出国，赴苏联的留学生将在国内学习一年俄文和政治理论后，明年暑期出国。
    今年从全国各地选拔出来的留学生中，有大学一年级学生、助教、研究生、高中学生、工农速成中学学生和少数机关干部。他们的政治质量、学业成绩和健康状况都较良好。其中共产党员和青年团员占百分之九十二以上。清华大学机械制造系一年级“工农班”学生刘文圃以前是铁路工厂机车间的学徒，现在被选为留学生了，他感到无限的兴奋和光荣。他说：我有信心完成祖国人民交给我的光荣任务，培养自己成为工人阶级知识分子。清华大学附设工农速成中学学生杨广文，原是个拾柴的贫苦孩子。他被选为留学生后激动地说：这是梦一样美好的事！杨广文决心好好学习，争取做一个忠实于党、忠于祖国社会主义事业的红色工程师。
