    In a Happy Family
    -- A Record of National Textile Industry Model Worker Huang Baomei's Family Discussing the Draft Constitution
    Chen Ruifeng
    One evening after the rain, I went with great joy to the home of Huang Baomei, the National Textile Industry Model Worker. The hospitable Comrade Baomei's family received me even more warmly than usual. Baomei's mother helped me take off my raincoat and wiped the raindrops from my head with a towel; Baomei's younger brother, Yongquan, jumped out to welcome me; Baomei brought me a cup of hot tea to drink. Being in such a happy family made one feel peaceful and warm.
    Huang Baomei had just returned from the Shanghai Yangshupu District People's Congress meeting, and a red silk strip with the words "Presidium" written on it was fluttering on her mosquito net. Seeing me arrive, Huang Baomei took out a copy of the Draft Constitution from her bag, flipping through it as she said, "We have been discussing the Draft Constitution every day for several days at the representative meeting. The Draft Constitution cannot but be supported, with its one hundred and six articles all aimed at enabling the people to live a happy life. I have an indescribable feeling of joy in my heart." Then she added, "Tomorrow I will make a speech on the Draft Constitution at the meeting, full of feelings, and I don't know where to start, so help me." Ignoring the guest's presence, her mother chimed in, "What is this Draft Constitution? I don't quite understand. Explain it to me in detail." Her mother's suggestion was immediately supported by the whole family. Baomei's husband, who was still in bed because he had been working the night shift, couldn't wait to stand up without buttoning his shirt, smiling as he said, "Discussing the Draft Constitution is a major event, and I want to participate too." When Baomei's father heard that they were going to talk about the Draft Constitution, he quickly found some stools. At this moment, the family naturally sat around Baomei in a circle. I was attracted by the family's enthusiasm.
    The discussion began. Baomei's husband proposed: "Baomei should chair the meeting, and Comrade Chen should read the Draft Constitution first." "We agree," the whole family said in unison. As I read the Draft Constitution, someone suddenly pushed open the door. It was a middle-aged woman, carrying a small stool. Baomei stood up and introduced me: "This is Comrade Liu Xiuying, a female worker from our workshop." "I live next door, and when I heard you reading the Draft Constitution, I came to listen," Xiuying said as she sat down. Everyone listened attentively to Baomei's speech. She said, "Yesterday, because the representative meeting was adjourned, I went back to the workshop to work a night shift, and I also discussed the Draft Constitution with comrades in my group. What they said helped me a lot. I deeply realize that the promulgation of the Draft Constitution will bring us a happier life." Baomei's father was so moved by her words that he stood up and said, "Before liberation, I worked for decades and never heard that labor was a glorious thing. I only heard it said, 'Good people don't work, and working will bring you shame.' The wages I received were not enough to support my family; if you waited even a moment to spend your money, you couldn't buy what you needed. Now workers can be masters of their own affairs, and they can go to the assembly hall. In the past, if three people talked together, they would be arrested. I also remember when I worked at the Meifu Oil Factory, we couldn't get enough to eat, so we went on strike, and as a result, the boss fired many people. The lackeys even helped the American boss scold us." Pointing to thirteen-year-old Yongquan, he continued, "In the past, we couldn't earn enough money, and eating sorghum rice during the New Year was common. Yongquan always clamored for good food, and it wasn't until Shanghai was liberated that our family really started eating well. The life we've had in the years since liberation is something we never dreamed of. With Chairman Mao's leadership, and now with the formulation of the Constitution, our working people's good days are even more guaranteed. I feel like my heart is blossoming." "I know a little about what a Constitution is. Let me say a few words," her mother began, holding her young grandson. "What his father said is true. In the past, female workers weren't considered people. I don't know how many I saw with my own eyes in the factory who were either fired or suspended from work as soon as they became pregnant or got sick. The boss simply didn't care if you lived or died." "That's absolutely right. In the past, if I had been pregnant like I am now, I would have been suspended from work at home long ago," Xiuying interjected excitedly. Her mother continued:
  "Baomei started working at the Yufeng Factory (now the State-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Textile Mill) at the age of thirteen. That year, we still lived in Pudong. One day, a strong wind came, and some of the small boats capsized in the river. I don't know how many workers drowned. So every time she went to work, we were always worried. The hardships of the past are truly endless." Her mother wiped her eyes, and a smile appeared on her face as she continued, "I never thought that the little girl (referring to Baomei) who was often scolded by the boss would become a labor model today, be rewarded by the state, go to Hangzhou for recuperation, attend the National Textile Industry Labor Model Conference held in Tianjin, see Chairman Mao in Beijing, and visit the Soviet Union. Now, everyone has elected her as a people's representative. Our whole family is also respected. When I think of all this, I will laugh in my sleep." Baomei's husband, who didn't usually talk much, also began to speak, "That's not all. Chairman Mao, in order to make the lives of the people across the country even happier, has now stipulated the rights of the working people in the national law." "Let me finish talking," her mother continued, "I support every article stipulated in the Draft Constitution from the bottom of my heart. I think of the happy life of the Soviet people that Baomei told me about, and I also think of what the Draft Constitution says, that our country, like the Soviet Union, will establish a socialist society, eliminate exploitation, and make everyone live a happier life. Although I am already a sixty-four-year-old woman, I want to live more and more, and I feel younger and younger. Although I can no longer continue to work, I will definitely guarantee to take care of the housework, cook good meals, and take care of Little Mao Tou (Baomei's child) so that you can concentrate on production." Her mother's words were interrupted again, as Yongquan found a copy of the China Young Pioneers Newspaper and held it over his head, saying, "The photo above shows Chairman Mao leading everyone in a meeting to pass and announce the Draft Constitution, and the line of big characters below says that the Draft Constitution has been announced, right? I'm keeping this newspaper as a memento." Yongquan walked in front of Baomei and said proudly, "Model Sister, look how new my newspaper is!"
    At this time, Baomei spoke. She talked about the significance of the Draft Constitution, the honor of being a people's representative and a labor model in the new society, and her visit to the Soviet Union and her determination to build the motherland. Baomei's words touched everyone's hearts. "I have two more sentences," her father continued, "I will promote the Draft Constitution to everyone in the neighborhood, and I will use practical actions to support the Draft Constitution." "I want to overcome the shortcomings of being too subjective, learn from Baomei, and strive to be a good Communist Party member," Baomei's husband said. Before he could sit down, Yongquan followed up, "I promise to study hard and serve the people when I grow up." At this point, everyone expressed their determination, one sentence after another. Everyone talked from 7:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Here, the discussion of the Draft Constitution by this glorious family came to a successful conclusion.

    在一个幸福的家庭里
    ——记全国纺织工业劳动模范黄宝妹家讨论宪法草案
    陈瑞枫
    一个雨后的晚上，我怀着满心喜悦到了全国纺织工业劳动模范黄宝妹家。好客的宝妹同志的一家人比任何一次更热情地接待了我。宝妹的妈妈帮我脱下雨衣，用毛巾揩着我头上的雨水；宝妹的弟弟永全跳出来欢迎我；宝妹端来一杯热茶让我喝。在这样一个幸福的家庭里，使人感到安详和温暖。
    黄宝妹刚刚出席上海市杨树浦区人民代表大会会议回来，一张红绸子的写着“主席团”字样的条子飘在她的帐子上。黄宝妹见我来，就从书包里拿出一本宪法草案翻着说：“开了几天代表会，天天讨论的是宪法草案。宪法草案不能不使人拥护，一百零六条规定，条条为着人民过幸福生活。我内心有说不出的高兴。”接着她又说：“明天我要在大会上作关于宪法草案的发言，满心感想，不知从那里讲起，你帮助帮助我。”在旁边的妈妈顾不得客人的心事，跟上一句：“啥叫宪法草案，我也不大明了，你们来详细说说。”母亲的提议马上受到全家人拥护。因为做夜班还躺在床上的宝妹的爱人，等不得扣好衣服钮子站起来笑嘻嘻地说：“讨论宪法草案是大事，我也要参加。”宝妹的父亲听说要谈宪法草案，连忙找了几个凳子。这时候一家人很自然地围着宝妹坐成一个圈子。我被这一家人的热烈情绪吸引住了。
    讨论会开始了。宝妹爱人提议：“宝妹主持会议，请陈同志把宪法草案先读一遍。”“我们同意。”全家人同声说。当我读了宪法草案以后，突然有人推开门。走进来的是一个中年妇女，拿着小凳。宝妹站起来给我介绍：“她是我们车间的女工刘秀英同志。”“我就住在隔壁，听到你们读宪法草案，我也来听听。”秀英一面说一面坐下来。大家聚精会神地听着宝妹的发言。她说：“昨天因为代表会休会，我回车间做了一个夜班，还和小组里的同志讨论了宪法草案，大家说的对我帮助很大。我深深体会到，宪法草案公布，将给我们带来更幸福的生活。”爸爸被宝妹的话感动得站了起来说：“解放以前，我做了几十年工，从来没有听说过劳动是光荣的事情，只是听到这样说：‘好人不做工，做工要落三分臭。’拿的工钱，养不活家小；钞票在手里迟用一刻钟，就买不到要买的东西。现在工人可以当家作主了，可以往大会场上跑了；过去，三个人在一起讲话就要被抓去。我还记得，在美孚火油厂做工时，我们吃不饱，罢工，结果被老板开除了好些人。狗腿子还帮助美国老板骂。”他指着十三岁的永全继续说：“过去做工拿不到钱，正月吃高粱饭是常事。永全总吵着要吃好饭，一直闹到上海解放，我们一家人才真的吃上了好饭。解放几年来的生活，是做梦也想不到的。有了毛主席的领导，现在又制定宪法，我们劳动人民的好日子更有保障了。我内心好像开了花。”“啥叫宪法，我也知道点了。你们让我来谈几句。”妈妈抱着小孙子说起来。“他爸爸说的一句不假。以前女工不算人，我在厂里不知亲眼见过多少，一怀孕，或者一有病，不是开除就被停工。老板根本不管你死活。”“这话一点不错，要在过去，像我这样怀了孕，老早被停工在家里了。”秀英激动地插了一句。妈妈又说下去：
  “宝妹十三岁就进裕丰厂（现在的国营上海第十七棉纺织厂）做工，那年我们还住在浦东。有一天大风来了，有的小船都翻在江心里，不知有多少工人淹死了。所以她每次去上工，我们都提心吊胆地。过去的苦真是说不完。”妈妈揩了揩眼睛，脸上露出笑容继续说：“真想不到，过去常被老板骂的毛丫头（指宝妹），今天当了劳动模范，受到国家奖励，到杭州去休养，参加在天津举行的全国纺织工业劳动模范大会，去北京看过毛主席，还到苏联去参观，现在，大家又选她做人民代表。我们全家人也都受到尊敬。我想到这一切，真会睡着了又笑醒了。”宝妹的爱人本来不大爱讲话，也讲起来了：“这些还不算，毛主席为了使全国人民的日子过得更幸福，现在还把劳动人民的权利一条条地规定在国家大法里。”“让我把话讲完。”妈妈继续说下去：“宪法草案里规定的每一条，我都从心里头拥护。我想到宝妹告诉我的苏联人民的幸福生活，又想到宪法草案上说的，我们国家也和苏联一样，要建立社会主义社会，消灭剥削，使大家过更幸福的生活。我虽然已经是六十四岁的老太婆，却越活越想活，越活越年青。虽然我不能再继续做工，但我一定保证料理好家务，做好饭，带好小毛头（宝妹的孩子），让你们安心生产。”妈妈的话又被打断，永全找来一张中国少年报举在头顶上说：“上面的照片，是毛主席领导大家开会通过公布宪法草案的情形，下面一行大字不是说宪法草案公布了吗？这张报，是我把它收藏起来的。”永全走到宝妹前面骄傲地说：“模范姐姐，你看我这张报多新呀！”
    这时，宝妹发言了。她谈了宪法草案的意义，谈了她在新社会当人民代表、当劳动模范的光荣，又谈了自己访问苏联的情况和建设祖国的决心。宝妹的话，句句说到大家的心里。“我还有两句。”父亲接着说：“我要向里弄里大大小小宣传宪法草案，要用实际行动来拥护宪法草案。”“我要克服主观性太强的缺点，向宝妹学习，争取做一个好共产党员。”宝妹的爱人说了还没坐下，永全又跟着说：“我保证好好学习，长大了为人民服务。”这时，你一句，他一句，各自表示了决心。大家从下午七时谈起，一下谈到九时半。到这里，这个光荣人家的宪法草案讨论会完满地结束了。
