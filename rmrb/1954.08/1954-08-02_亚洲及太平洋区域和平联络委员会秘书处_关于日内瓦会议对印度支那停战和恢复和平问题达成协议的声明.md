Xinhua News Agency, 1st. August - The following is the full text of the statement of the Secretariat of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee regarding the Geneva Conference Agreements on Indochina Armistice and Restoration of Peace:

	The Secretariat of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee warmly welcomes and congratulates the Geneva Conference on reaching an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina. This not only ends the eight years of painful and brutal Indochina war, makes a beneficial contribution to safeguarding peace and security in Asia, but will also further ease tensions in Asia and the world.

	The Geneva Conference overcame all kinds of difficulties and obstructions to finally reach an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina. This is a clear proof that the forces of all countries defending peace are growing stronger and irresistible. It proves that the policy of strength pursued by the enemies of peace to continue creating international tensions has suffered, and will continue to suffer, a shameful defeat.

	The cessation of the Indochina War realizes the peaceful aspirations of the people of Indochina, the people of France, and the peace-loving people of the world. This is another major victory for the principle of peaceful negotiation and peaceful coexistence, following the Korean armistice. This victory powerfully proves that any international dispute can be resolved through peaceful negotiation as long as the countries concerned sincerely negotiate.

	The agreement on the Indochina armistice and the restoration of peace brings new hope for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. For the sake of peace in Asia and the world, the countries concerned are required to continue their efforts to seek a reasonable solution to the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea.

	Now, the enemies of peace are not reconciled to the failures they suffered at the Geneva Conference and are actively forming the so-called Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, attempting to create opposing military blocs in Asia and using Asians to fight Asians. We believe that the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions will heighten their vigilance a hundredfold, unite more closely, and together with the people of all countries in the world, resolutely continue to fight to ensure the thorough implementation of the agreement, to smash the aggressive conspiracies to create opposing blocs in Asia, and to safeguard peace and security in Asia and the world. The Secretariat of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee will make greater efforts to promote this struggle.

    关于日内瓦会议对印度支那停战和恢复和平问题达成协议的声明
    【新华社一日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书处关于日内瓦会议对印度支那停战和恢复和平问题达成协议的声明。全文如下：
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书处热烈欢迎和祝贺日内瓦会议就恢复印度支那和平达成协议。这不仅结束了八年的痛苦和残酷的印度支那战争，对保障亚洲和平与安全作出了有益的贡献，并将进一步缓和亚洲及世界的紧张局势。
    日内瓦会议在恢复印度支那和平问题上克服了种种困难和阻挠终于取得了协议，这是各国保卫和平力量日益壮大、不可抗拒的明证，它证明和平的敌人所奉行的继续制造国际紧张局势的实力政策遭受了，并将继续遭受到可耻的失败。
    印度支那战争的停止，实现了印度支那人民、法国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的和平愿望。这是继朝鲜停战之后，和平协商与和平共处的原则的又一重大胜利。这一胜利有力地证明：任何国际争端，只要有关国家真诚地进行谈判，都可以通过和平协商的方式获致解决。
    印度支那停战和恢复和平问题的达成协议，给朝鲜问题的和平解决带来了新的希望，为着亚洲和世界的和平，要求有关国家继续努力，就和平统一朝鲜问题求得合理的解决。
    现在，和平的敌人不甘心他们在日内瓦会议上所遭受的失败，正在积极活动成立所谓太平洋反共联盟和东南亚公约，企图在亚洲制造对立的军事集团，用亚洲人打亚洲人。我们相信，亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民将百倍提高警惕，更紧密地团结一致，并与世界各国人民在一起，为保证协议的彻底实现，为击破在亚洲制造对立集团的侵略阴谋，为维护亚洲及世界的和平与安全而坚决继续奋斗。亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书处将为促进这一奋斗而作更大的努力。
                                          亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书处
           一九五四年八月一日
