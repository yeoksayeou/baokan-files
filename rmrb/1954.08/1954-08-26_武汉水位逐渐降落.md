Xinhua News Agency report: The water level of the Yangtze River at Wuhan is gradually decreasing. At 5:00 PM on the 25th, the Yangtze River water level at Wuhan Customs was four centimeters lower than at the same time on the 24th, at 29.56 meters, still 1.28 meters higher than the highest water level in previous years. Since the Wuhan Customs Yangtze River water level began to recede from 29.73 meters at 3:00 AM on the 19th, it has fallen by 1.7 decimeters in nearly seven days, maintaining a steady decline. In the first to fourth days, it fell a total of seven centimeters; in the fifth and sixth days, it fell three centimeters each day; today is the seventh day, and it has fallen four centimeters. The rate of water level decline has slightly accelerated compared to the beginning.

In the nearly five days since the 21st, within the Yangtze River Basin from Wuhan upstream to Chongqing, a distance of 1,370 kilometers, the water level has been declining along the entire line, except for a slight increase in the water level in Shashi due to the influence of the gate closure. Areas upstream of Wuhan that had exceeded the highest water level in previous years have now fallen below the highest water level in previous years. The water level in areas downstream of Wuhan all the way to Zhenjiang is still exceeding the highest water level in previous years.

    武汉水位逐渐降落
    据新华社讯：武汉关长江水位逐渐下落。二十五日下午五时，武汉关长江水位比二十四日同一时间下落四公分，为二九点五六公尺，比历年最高水位还高出一点二八公尺。自十九日晨三时武汉关长江水位由二九点七三公尺开始回落后近七天来已下落一公寸七，保持稳落状态。在第一天到第四天内，共下落七公分，第五天和第六天两天内，每天下落三公分，今天是第七天，已下落四公分。水位下降速度比开始稍微加快了一点。
    从二十一日以后近五天来，长江流域自武汉以上一直到重庆一三七零公里的地区内，除沙市曾因关闸影响水位一度微升外，全线水位都在下落。武汉以上曾经超过历年最高水位的地方，现在都已落至历年最高水位以下。武汉以下一直到镇江各地水位还是超过历年最高水位。
