Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 3rd: The Yangtze River's midstream flood continues to rise. Recently, due to continued rainfall in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers of Dongting Lake, as well as the Yangtze River in Sichuan, continue to rise. At 13:00 on August 3rd, the Yangtze River water level at the Wuhan Customs Station had risen to 28.94 meters, 0.66 meters higher than the historical high water level of 28.28 meters. Under such high water levels, the people of Wuhan are still resolutely defending.

The flood in the Jingjiang section, influenced by the water from the Sichuan River and the downstream Dongting Lake, continues to rise despite the ongoing diversion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. Tens of thousands of cadres and laborers defending the Jingjiang levee are persistently fighting the flood. According to flood forecasts, there are still flood peaks descending from the upper reaches, so the water situation is still developing.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Central South Military Region stationed in the midstream area of the Yangtze River are intensively assisting local people in flood prevention and rescue. Troops stationed in Wuhan actively participated in flood prevention work. Many cadres and soldiers braved wind and rain to transport earth and sand, and patrolled the dikes day and night. All the cadres and soldiers of a certain unit of the Hubei Military Region participated in the heightening project of a certain section of the Yangtze River levee. When there were not enough tools, they used their bed sheets and clothes to wrap the soil. Within ten days, they heightened a section of the levee 600 meters long and 3 meters wide by 70 centimeters. Students from a certain automotive school braved heavy rain to help farmers repair dikes, protecting more than 2,000 mu of farmland and the safety of more than 100 farmers' households, and helped the local state-owned farm repair dikes and transport earth to heighten them. Troops stationed in various parts of Central South also actively helped the people prevent waterlogging and floods and rush to harvest crops. Commanders and fighters of a certain unit helped farmers rush to harvest more than 19,700 mu of wheat in fifteen days. The heroic struggle of the commanders and fighters of all units for the benefit of the people greatly encouraged the local people's confidence in fighting the flood.

    武汉水位持续上涨防汛紧张进行
    人民解放军大力协助驻地人民防汛抢险
    【新华社武汉三日电】长江中游洪水持续上涨。近日由于长江上游继续降雨，洞庭湖湘、资、沅、澧四水及四川长江继续涨水。八月三日十三时，武汉关长江水位已上涨到二十八点九四公尺，比历史最高水位二十八点二八公尺高出零点六六公尺。在这样高水位的情况下，武汉市人民仍在坚决防守中。
    荆江段洪水在川江来水及下游洞庭湖来水的影响下，虽然荆江分洪工程继续分洪，水位仍不断上升。防守荆江大堤的数万干部和民工正在与洪水坚持进行斗争，根据洪水预报，上游还有洪峰下泄，所以水情仍在继续发展中。
    据新华社讯：中国人民解放军中南军区驻守长江中游地区的部队，正紧张地协助驻地人民防汛抢险。驻武汉市的部队积极参加防汛工作，许多干部、战士冒着风雨运土搬沙，日夜在堤上巡逻。湖北军区某部全体干部、战士参加了长江大堤某段的加高工程，工具不够用，他们就用自己的被单、衣服包土，十天内把六百公尺长、三公尺宽的一段大堤加高了七十公分。某汽车学校的学员冒着大雨，协助农民抢修堤防，保全了两千多亩田地和一百多户农民的安全，并帮助驻地的国营农场抢修堤坝，运土加高。分散驻在中南各地的部队，也积极帮助人民防涝防洪、抢收庄稼。某部指战员曾在十五天内帮助农民突击收麦一万九千七百多亩，各部指战员为人民利益而英勇奋斗的行动，大大鼓舞了当地人民同洪水作斗争的信心。
