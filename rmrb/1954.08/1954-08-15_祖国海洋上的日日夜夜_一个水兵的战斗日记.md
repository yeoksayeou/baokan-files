Days and Nights on the Motherland's Seas
-- A Sailor's Combat Diary
蔡 Zaisheng

May 12

In the afternoon, we finally received the order to set out on a combat mission, and the comrades' excitement was indescribable. Everyone had been itching for battle for two full days. Two days ago, when we noticed that shells were being loaded onto the gunboats, everyone was anticipating departure! At that time, comrades who were about to go on leave or had been approved to return home immediately gave up their leave and plans to return home. Some comrades deliberately asked, "What's wrong? The organization already approved it, why aren't you leaving?" The answer was interesting: "What's wrong, am I blind? You're going to fight, and you want me to go home to look after my small family?"

Now, the order has come, and the flotilla is setting off. Those comrades left behind to guard the island gathered on the dock, watching our well-organized and mighty flotilla leave the port with envious and victory-wishing eyes. They stood on the dock for a very long time, reluctant to leave.

May 15

At night, our flotilla passed through dense clouds and approached the enemy-occupied island. Our flotilla's combat mission was to provide cover for the army landing here and to attack enemy ships as the opportunity arose.

When the enemy spotted us, they fired a few white signal flares with a "snap, snap, snap," but we ignored them. The enemy was suspicious, so they hurriedly sailed out two ships hidden behind the island. Suddenly, a searchlight shone over our boat, illuminating our boat and the surrounding sea. The enemy spotted us and immediately fired explosive shells at us, the shrapnel hitting the deck and iron, sending out white sparks. At this time, the commander ordered the gunners to concentrate their fire on the enemy ships. Clusters of fireballs flew across the sea towards the enemy ships, and immediately a series of violent explosions rang out on the enemy ships. The enemy ships could not withstand this deadly blow, so they abandoned their island companions and fled for their lives.

At this time, red and green landing signals rose, and our troops had launched a landing attack from the predetermined beachhead. Then signals of successful landings from all directions soared into the sky. This means that these islands are about to return to the embrace of the motherland.

May 16

At dawn, our landing troops had completely occupied the island. At 6:20 a.m., the sea lookout reported: "Three enemy ships are spotted approaching us from the left front!"

Our flotilla had just formed a battle formation when the enemy ships opened fire on us. We immediately returned fire. After a burst of fierce artillery fire, the enemy ships could not hold on and turned east, only to be intercepted head-on by our two warships. At this time, more enemy warships arrived to reinforce them, and a fierce battle began on the sea. Our warships concentrated their fire on the enemy flagship "Taihe," and within a few minutes, the enemy "Taihe" was hit by eight shells in a row.

In order to actively support the warships, our flotilla immediately went around behind the mountain to prepare to attack the enemy ships from the flank, but by the time we arrived, the enemy ships had already been beaten into a panic by our warships and were fleeing in disorder. By noon, we had fought continuously with the enemy ships three times, each time maintaining the honor of the People's Navy and giving the enemy a hard time.

The command post was particularly concerned about our flotilla, and after each battle, they would send a telegram to ask: "Are there any casualties? Any damage to the boats? Do you need to replenish ammunition and supplies?" Our reply each time was: "The boats are safe and undamaged, the grain and ammunition are still sufficient, and there are no casualties."

That night, the enemy sent two ships in an attempt to launch a tentative counter-attack landing on the islands we had occupied, but before they could get close to our coast, one was sunk and the other was captured by us.

May 19

The weather was particularly hot, and by noon, the deck was like a fire. After continuous day and night fighting, everyone was indeed exhausted. Taking advantage of the absence of enemy activity, everyone tried to rest. As soon as I lay down, I fell asleep. I had just fallen asleep when I suddenly heard someone shout: "Aircraft! Aircraft!" I jumped up and ran to the anti-aircraft machine gun. At this time, two white enemy planes had dived down towards us, and the anti-aircraft guns on the boat also roared immediately. I aimed at the enemy plane and fired a burst of shots. Just as I was loading the second burst to prepare to shoot, suddenly, "snap, snap, snap," a few signal flares were fired on the boat. I immediately stopped shooting.

"Ah, great! Our air force is out."

"Ah! They've got them! They've got them!" The gunners on the front deck were gesturing and shouting excitedly. I hurriedly looked in the direction everyone was pointing, and sure enough, our two Sea Eagles had indeed caught up with the two enemy planes that had been rampaging. We watched with rapt attention, our hearts pounding with excitement. Suddenly, a burst of fierce fire erupted from the heads of our Sea Eagles, and then one of the enemy planes released a puff of black smoke and crashed into the sea with a "bang."

The other enemy plane was very cunning. It did not escape nor fly up, but stubbornly circled around an island. Our Sea Eagle chased it for a while but could not catch it. So the Sea Eagle deliberately glided past the enemy plane and continued forward. The enemy plane tried to take this opportunity to slip away. Hey! Our Sea Eagle seemed to have eyes in the back of its head. It turned around sharply, and a dive shot the enemy plane into the sea.

This moving air battle over the sea was truly exciting. At this time, I further realized the significance of joint sea, land, and air operations and how powerful our national defense forces are. (Attached image)

The comrades who were not leaving, with envious and victory-wishing eyes, watched us leave the port.

    祖国海洋上的日日夜夜
    ——一个水兵的战斗日记
  　蔡再生
    五月十二日
    下午，我们终于接到了出发执行战斗任务的命令，同志们那股兴奋劲儿简直无法形容。大家磨拳擦掌等待战斗已经整整两天了。两天以前，当一发现开始给炮艇装炮弹时，大家就期待着出发了！当时，临到休假和被批准回家的同志，都马上放弃了休假和回家的打算。有的同志故意问道：“怎么？组织上已经批准了，为什么又不走呢？”回答是有趣的：“咋了，我又不是瞎子，你们去打仗，让我回家去看个人的小家庭？”
    现在，命令下来了，艇队出发了。那些留下守卫海岛的同志聚集在码头上，用羡慕和预祝胜利的眼光，看着我们整齐威武的艇队离开港口，很久很久，他们站在码头上不肯离去。
      五月十五日
    晚上，我们艇队穿过密密层层的云雾接近了敌占的岛屿。我们艇队担负的战斗任务是掩护陆军在这里登陆，相机攻击敌人的舰艇。
    当敌人发现了我们的时候，“啪啪啪”打出了几颗白色讯号弹，我们没有理睬它。敌人怀疑了，于是他们把隐伏在岛后面的两艘舰慌慌张张地开了出来。忽然，一颗照明灯打到我们艇的上空，把我们艇上和附近海面照得通亮。敌人发现了我们，立即用爆炸弹向我们打来，弹片撞在甲板和铁器上，迸出白色的火星。这时，指挥员命令炮手们，集中炮火向敌舰猛击。只见一群群火球越过海面向敌舰飞去，顿时敌舰上响起剧烈的爆炸声。敌舰受不了这一阵致命的打击，于是就丢下它岛上的伙伴，独自逃命了。
    这时升起了红红绿绿的登陆讯号，我们的部队已从预定的滩头，发起登陆攻击。接着四面八方登陆成功的讯号也腾上天空。这就是说，这些岛屿都要重新回到祖国的怀抱了。
      五月十六日
    拂晓，我登陆部队就全部占领了岛屿。六点二十分，海面了望哨报告：“左前方发现三艘敌舰向我驶来！”
    我们的艇队刚摆开战斗队形，敌舰已向我们开炮射击了。我们立即还击了敌人。一阵猛烈的炮火以后，敌舰支持不住了，调头向东开去，那知正好被我两艘军舰当头拦住。这时敌人军舰又增援来了×艘，于是海面上一场激战开始了。我们的军舰集中火力射击敌人的旗舰“太和”号，在几分钟内，敌“太和”号连中了八颗炮弹。
    我们艇队为了积极支援军舰，立即绕过山后准备从侧面打击敌舰，可是当我们赶到时，敌舰已被我们的军舰打得狼狈逃窜了。到中午止，我们已和敌舰连续战斗了三次，每次都保持了人民海军的荣誉，使敌人大吃苦头。
    指挥部对我们艇队特别关心，每次战斗结束就拍电报来问：“人员有无伤亡？艇只有无损失？弹药给养是否需要补充？”我们每次的回答都是：“艇只安全无损，粮弹也还充足，人员无一伤亡。”
    当天晚上，敌人派了两条船企图向我们占领的岛屿进行试探性反击登陆，可是没等它们靠近我们的海边，一条被打沉，另一条被我们抓住了。
      五月十九日
    天气特别热，一到中午，甲板上像火烤一样。经过日夜连续战斗以后，大家都确实疲倦了，乘着没有敌情的机会大家争取休息一下，一躺下便睡着了。我刚睡着，忽然听到有人喊：“飞机！飞机！”我一跳起来就向高射机枪跑去。这时两架白色的敌机已向我们俯冲下来，艇上的高射炮也立即怒吼起来。我瞄准敌机，一口气打了一梭子，当我刚装上第二梭准备射击的时候，突然，“啪啪啪”艇上发出了几颗讯号弹。我立即停止了射击。
    “啊，好啊！我们的空军出动了。”
      “啊！咬住了！咬住了！”前甲板上的炮手们都在指手划脚高兴地叫喊着。我急忙顺着大家指点的方向望去，果然不错，咱们的两架海鹰真的已经咬住了刚才还行凶的那两架敌机。我们目不转睛的望着，心里兴奋得直跳，猛然从我们的海鹰头上发出一阵激烈的炮火，接着，一架敌机放了股黑烟，“轰”的一声就栽到海里去了。
    另一架敌机很狡猾，它不逃也不飞上去，死活围着一个岛屿转，我们的海鹰追了一阵，总是咬不住它，于是海鹰故意滑过敌机一直向前飞去，敌机企图利用这个机会溜掉，嘿！我们的海鹰好像后面长着眼睛似的，猛调头，一个俯冲就把敌机打下海去了。
    这一场动人的海上空战真令人兴奋，这时，我进一步体会到海陆空联合作战的意义和祖国国防力量是多么强大了。（附图片）
    不出发的同志，用羡慕和预祝胜利的眼光，目送我们离开港口。
