Xinhua News Agency, 31st: U.S. authorities are colluding with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to intensify the strengthening and deployment of Chiang Kai-shek bandit military forces, preparing to expand their aggressive actions against our country.

    The U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, intelligence boss Donovan, arrived in Taiwan on the 28th to conduct conspiratorial activities. Donovan immediately began inspecting and examining the Chiang Kai-shek bandit military bases and military equipment on the 29th. After the inspection, Donovan will hold secret talks with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and others. According to International News Service reports, the U.S. military "aid" advisory group stationed in Taiwan, in order to conceal Donovan's conspiratorial activities in Taiwan, has requested the Chiang Kai-shek traitor group to "restrict the news of Donovan's current trip to Taiwan." According to the Pan-Asia News Agency, which has close ties with the Chiang Kai-shek gang, Donovan's mission to Taiwan is to discuss the "new situation" after the end of the Indochina War with Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S. military leaders stationed in Taiwan, which means expanding aggression and war actions against our country. Donovan will also plan with them to piece together a Southeast Asian military aggression group aimed at our country and "study from a military point of view" the "tasks of the Chiang Kai-shek gang and Thailand in this proposed Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." In addition, Donovan will also collude with Chiang Kai-shek to support and assist the Thai reactionary regime in forcibly incorporating 50,000 overseas Chinese into the so-called "Overseas Chinese Self-Defense Force," serving as cannon fodder for the United States to launch new aggression in Asia.

    The new commander of the U.S. Pacific Marine Corps, Peppard, also arrived in Taiwan on the 26th and conducted two days of conspiratorial activities. According to Western news agencies, Peppard held secret talks with senior Chiang Kai-shek bandit military officers and U.S. military leaders stationed in Taiwan, and inspected the amphibious landing exercises of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Marine Corps. At the same time, according to the Chiang Kai-shek gang's news agencies and newspapers, dozens of senior officers of the U.S. Pacific Fleet have arrived in Taiwan one after another recently. They will hold meetings with senior Chiang Kai-shek bandit military officers to study the expansion of aggressive actions against our country. In order to accelerate this conspiracy between the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the U.S. authorities will transfer a batch of F-86 Saber jets to the Chiang Kai-shek gang ahead of schedule and will transport more military supplies to Taiwan.

    Meanwhile, according to Robert Allen, a columnist for the "New York Post" in Washington, in order to turn Taiwan into a permanent U.S. base of aggression, reactionary congressmen of the notorious "Committee of One Million Against the Admission of Communist China to the United Nations" headed by Nolan are launching a "huge movement" in an attempt to drag the Chiang Kai-shek gang into the Southeast Asian military aggression group organized by the United States and use military force to protect the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who is despised by the people of the world. These reactionary senators have already "held a series of secret meetings" with Secretary of State Dulles. Dulles emphatically assured them that the U.S. authorities will "not allow" the Chinese people to liberate their territory of Taiwan. Dulles also stated that "the best way to deal with this issue is for the United States and the Kuomintang to sign a mutual defense treaty similar to the one signed with South Korea," and stated that "the Kuomintang can participate after the Southeast Asia League is established."

    美国当局勾结蒋匪加紧部署蒋匪军事力量
   【新华社三十一日讯】美国当局正勾结卖国贼蒋介石紧张地加强和部署蒋匪军事力量，准备扩大对我国的侵略行动。
    美国驻泰国大使、特务头子杜诺万已在二十八日到达台湾进行阴谋活动。杜诺万在二十九日立即开始视察和检查蒋匪军的军事基地和军事设备。杜诺万在视察结束后，将和卖国贼蒋介石等进行秘密会谈。据国际新闻社报道，驻台湾的美国军事“援助”顾问团为了掩盖杜诺万在台湾的阴谋活动，已经要求蒋匪卖国集团对杜诺万“目前台湾之行的消息加以限制”。据和蒋匪帮有密切关系的泛亚社透露，杜诺万到台湾的任务是同蒋介石和驻台湾的美军首脑商讨印度支那战争结束后的“新局势”，也就是扩大对我国的侵略和战争行动。杜诺万还将和他们策划拼凑矛头针对我国的东南亚军事侵略集团，并“从军事观点来研究”蒋匪帮和泰国“在这个拟议建立的东南亚公约组织中的任务”。此外，杜诺万还将和蒋匪策划支持和协助泰国反动政权把五万名华侨强迫编入所谓“华侨自卫队”，为美国在亚洲发动新的侵略充当炮灰的阴谋。
    美国新任太平洋海军陆战队司令佩帕尔也在二十六日到达台湾，进行了两天阴谋活动。据西方通讯社报道，佩帕尔在台湾时同蒋匪高级军官和驻台湾的美军首脑进行了秘密会谈，并视察了蒋匪海军陆战队的两栖登陆作战演习。同时，据蒋匪帮通讯社和报纸透露，美国太平洋舰队的数十名高级军官已在最近陆续到达台湾。他们将和蒋匪军高级军官举行会议，研究扩大对我国的侵略行动。为了加速进行美蒋匪帮的这个阴谋，美国当局将提早把一批F—八十六型的佩刀式飞机移交给蒋匪帮，并且将把更多的军事物资运到台湾去。
    同时，据“纽约邮报”驻华盛顿的专栏作家罗伯特·艾伦报道，为了把台湾变成美国永久的侵略基地，以诺兰为首的臭名远扬的“援华院外活动集团”的反动议员们正在发动一个“巨大的运动”，企图把蒋匪帮拉进美国组织的东南亚军事侵略集团中去，并且用军事力量来庇护全世界人民所不齿的卖国贼蒋介石。这些反动参议员已经和国务卿杜勒斯“举行了一系列的秘密会议”。杜勒斯向他们着重保证，美国当局将“不容许”中国人民解放自己的领土台湾。杜勒斯还表示，“处理这个问题的最好的办法是由美国和国民党签订一项类似和南朝鲜所签订的共同防御条约”，并且表示，“到东南亚联盟成立起来以后，可以使国民党参加”。
