Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Farming Company

Establishes Thirteen Fish Fry Cultivation Farms

    Guangdong Province's 1.6 million mu of fish ponds and many barren and abandoned ponds have been restored to aquaculture production in recent years, and the demand for fish fry has increased rapidly. In order to develop freshwater aquaculture and meet the needs of farmers raising fish, the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Farming Company recently reorganized and expanded its thirteen fish fry promotion stations in Guangzhou, Kaiping, Chao'an, Shunde, Shaoguan, Nanxiong, Meixian, and other places into fish fry cultivation farms, in order to carry out the cultivation of various fish fry based on freshwater aquaculture science and technology and mass experience.
