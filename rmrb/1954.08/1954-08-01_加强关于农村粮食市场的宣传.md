    Strengthen Publicity Regarding Rural Grain Markets
    Zhang Qian

    The establishment of new-style rural grain markets under state leadership, without the participation of private merchants, is an important measure for thoroughly implementing the state's grain policy and is related to the vital economic interests of the broad masses of peasants. Paying attention to publicizing the political and economic significance of these rural grain markets, promptly exposing various problems in the work, pointing out the direction forward, and attracting the broad masses of peasants to participate in the activities of these markets is an important task for newspapers in various regions, especially those aimed primarily at peasants.

    In recent months, most of the newspapers at the level of the large administrative regions and the provincial newspapers aimed primarily at peasants have paid relatively close attention to this publicity and have made certain efforts to promote the establishment of rural grain markets. However, many newspapers have not publicized it deeply enough, focusing only on reflecting the numbers of market transactions but rarely deeply reflecting the problems in the grain market work and the impact of establishing such markets on rural economic life. There are even a few newspapers that pay very little attention to this publicity work, publicizing it infrequently and untimely. Therefore, strengthening publicity regarding rural grain markets so that it can adapt to the needs of the work has become a problem that many newspapers need to solve currently.

    An important aspect of strengthening publicity regarding rural grain markets is to comprehensively explain the political and economic significance of such markets. This means using concrete examples from the local area to explain the changes in the free market after the state's unified purchase and sale of grain, explaining the state's grain policy, and explaining the significance of establishing new-style grain markets for peasants to exchange goods, invigorate the rural economy, and adjust supply and demand relationships. It also means ideologically educating cadres and peasants to recognize the importance and urgency of establishing rural grain markets. When conducting this publicity, newspapers must specifically explain that, due to the development of state industrial production, the continuous increase in the population of urban industrial and mining areas, and the corresponding development of economic crop production, the demand for grain has increased compared to the past. Therefore, after the unified purchase of grain, peasants can sell their surplus grain on the market to help households lacking grain solve their difficulties, which will reduce the state's grain supply burden and allow the state to have more grain to ensure the needs of the urban and rural people. This is very beneficial to the country's socialist construction. At the same time, after the establishment of these markets, surplus grain households can invest the money earned from selling grain into production, grain-deficient households can buy the necessary grain, and some farmers can exchange for the types of grain they need in the market or make temporary adjustments. Furthermore, because these markets crack down on black market activities in grain, the interests of farmers can be further protected because they are no longer exploited by speculative grain merchants in market transactions. In this regard, Zhejiang Daily has done relatively well. In explaining these meanings, Zhejiang Daily used articles in popular form to comprehensively explain what new-style grain markets are, what benefits the establishment of new-style grain markets brings to the country and the peasants, and what attitude peasants should have towards them. Obviously, by linking the vital interests of the masses with the interests of national construction through this publicity, and by making the broad masses of cadres and the masses understand that this kind of market suits both the habits and requirements of the peasants and the needs of the country, their understanding can be improved and their active participation in this work can be promoted.

    Another important aspect of strengthening publicity regarding rural grain markets is to conduct meticulous persuasion, education, and criticism in response to the various ideological concerns and incorrect practices of cadres and the masses. Because when the policy and ideological level of cadres and the masses has not been raised to a certain degree, they will not only have many questions and concerns in their thinking, but cadres will also encounter many difficulties or even make mistakes in their work. It is the responsibility of newspapers to explain these problems, dispel these concerns, criticize erroneous practices, and point out the correct practices. When newspapers conduct ideological education among cadres and the masses, they should use editorials and news reports to address the cadres' thinking that after the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, the state should "take care of" the grain supply and that establishing grain markets is "trouble-making," and their concerns that these markets will become "free markets," as well as the peasants' concerns that "selling grain is not honorable now," that they are afraid of being satirized and attacked, and that "it is easy to sell grain but difficult to buy grain," and conduct thorough analysis and criticism. On the one hand, newspapers should explain to cadres that, after the planned purchase of grain, the state has not purchased all of the peasants' surplus grain, and planned supply cannot fully meet the diverse needs of the peasants. If they insist on "taking care of" it and do not organize the exchange of goods between peasants, it will inevitably cause partial stagnation of the rural economy, force peasants to seek help from speculative merchants, and leave a large gap for grain speculation activities, resulting in real trouble and causing irreparable losses. On the other hand, the problems resulting from insufficient unified purchase and sale can be addressed through rural grain markets, and the activities of speculative grain merchants can be cracked down on by strengthening market management, which is enough to prevent the development of spontaneous forces in rural areas. On the other hand, it should also be explained to the peasants that it is legitimate for surplus grain households to sell grain on this market to support their neighbors in difficulty, and the government encourages and protects such legitimate trading behavior; grain speculation is shameful and is not allowed by the government and the people. The state will be responsible for supplying the grain necessary for grain-deficient households at any time. Shanghai's Liberation Daily, Shandong's Dazhong Daily, Hunan Daily, and Zhejiang Daily have all grasped this main point and conducted appropriate explanations and criticisms. Doing so is very beneficial to promoting the establishment of rural grain markets.

    Newspapers should not only pay attention to dispelling the ideological concerns of cadres and the masses, but also need to point out to them what are erroneous practices and what are correct practices. Some newspapers have criticized the phenomena of cadres being hesitant to move forward in establishing markets or letting the markets run wild without leadership, as well as the new deviations that have occurred in establishing markets. For example, Shandong's Dazhong Daily used the example of the number of spontaneous grain markets in some areas of four prefectures, including Jining, greatly exceeding the number of state grain markets, to forcefully point out the necessity of quickly correcting the state of being slow to move forward and adopting a policy of actively leading and transforming spontaneous markets. Hunan Daily criticized the phenomenon of Hengshan County adopting high prices to attract grain to the market, and Zhejiang Daily criticized the phenomenon of Yishan Town grain market in Pingyang County allowing private merchants to participate in transactions, which violated policies. In addition, some newspapers have also promptly introduced good working experiences. For example, Gansu Daily commended the grain market in Yaodian District, Jingchuan County, for using the method of comparing the prices of industrial and agricultural products to publicize the principle that unstable grain prices only benefit a few speculators and cause most peasants to suffer losses, thus educating and persuading grain-selling peasants not to raise grain prices in the case of initially insufficient grain on the market. Zhejiang Daily and Henan Daily also introduced the experiences of Jinhua Prefecture and Cuqiao District, Fugou County, in rapidly developing grain market work, respectively. The above-mentioned newspapers not only quickly disseminated various good working experiences, but also helped cadres and the masses to correctly draw ideological and policy boundaries by criticizing various erroneous ideas and practices, so that they could quickly correct their mistakes.

    In order to strengthen publicity on the establishment of rural grain markets, in addition to paying attention to the above-mentioned issues, it is also necessary to improve our publicity methods and pay attention to selecting and combining various typical local examples to conduct vivid and concrete publicity. In fact, with the large-scale establishment of this new type of market, new changes are taking place or have already taken place in the thinking and economic lives of the peasants. Specifically reflecting these new changes and new atmospheres in newspapers is the most powerful form of living education. Some newspapers have reflected some aspects of this situation. For example, Shanxi Daily reported that after the establishment of a grain market in Zhongcun Township, Lucheng County, the peasants said: "With a market, we are not worried. We can buy whatever we need at any time." Among the 400 households that originally requested the state to supply grain, 200 automatically removed their names, reducing the state's supply burden. Shanghai's Liberation Daily reported that Sun Mingyu, a cotton farmer in the Fourth District of Dexian County, Shandong, originally feared that grain would be difficult to buy, so he planned to leave seven mu of cotton land to grow grain. After the grain market was established, he immediately planted these seven mu of land with cotton. Although there are not many such examples in the newspapers, and the existing reports are relatively simple, they reflect the improvement of the peasants' understanding and their trust in the market, and they reflect the peasants' actual actions to actively expand production and their determination to fight against grain merchants, which can educate cadres and the masses to specifically recognize the important significance of establishing this market and set an example among the masses, thereby encouraging people to participate in the activities of this market. This approach by newspapers is undoubtedly worth promoting.

    However, judging from the publicity situation in the past few months, some newspapers still have some shortcomings in this publicity, which has affected the role of newspapers in thoroughly implementing the state's grain policy. First of all, a few newspapers have rarely conducted reports in this area in recent months, or even if they do, they are not timely enough. For example, Liaoxi and Rehe provinces began to focus on establishing rural grain markets as early as April. However, after this, most areas of Northeast China were slow to establish such markets, and some areas have been slowly carrying out "pilot" work. The Northeast Daily criticized this on July 1, which is correct. However, the newspaper did not promptly raise criticism, explain the importance of this work, and attract the attention of party and government leading organs at all levels to promote this work in the case of the relatively slow development of rural grain markets in the entire Northeast region. If newspapers do not promptly reflect the situation and problems in the establishment of rural grain markets, they will naturally not be able to effectively promote this work forward.

    Secondly, many newspapers rarely pay attention to clarifying the significance that the establishment of this new type of grain market is an integral part of the state's grain policy and is a supplementary force for the state's unified purchase and sale of grain. In addition, a few newspapers, although they mentioned the significance of the grain market, only talked about the benefits to the peasants, not the benefits to the country; or they focused on the benefits to the peasants' lives, emphasizing that it can satisfy the peasants' "tastes" and allow them to eat well, but rarely talked about the benefits to production. In this way, failure to explain the significance of establishing this market in the reports will certainly not be able to ideologically mobilize cadres and the masses to attach importance to this work; and incomplete publicity on its significance will also not achieve the effect of mobilizing peasants to actively participate in this work.

    Again, some newspapers have also abandoned or relaxed the necessary struggle against erroneous ideas and practices. Sometimes, newspapers touch on or raise some sharp questions, but fail to solve the problems. For example, in a report on April 16, Xi'an Mass Daily said that the work of establishing rural grain markets in the central areas of Shaanxi Province was not going well enough. One of the reasons was that some cadres were afraid that after the establishment of the market, they would increase their responsibility for storing and handling the grain they received, so they took a negative attitude towards the work of establishing grain markets. However, why did this erroneous understanding of cadres become an obstacle to the establishment of markets in this area? What are the errors in this understanding and negative attitude? What is the correct solution? The newspaper did not explain. Failure to promptly raise problems hindering the progress of work for analysis and criticism weakens its role in guiding practice. Naturally, what is even worse is that some newspapers have also made incorrect publicity about policies. In a report on May 11, Jilin Daily said that in the grain market of Qian'an County, "those who sell grain are all peasants, and those who buy grain are all family members of employees, city residents, and canteens of institutions, etc." The grain required by the personnel of the institutions should be supplied in a planned way by the state grain departments through the organizations of these institutions, which was stipulated earlier in the Government Administration Council's "Order on Implementing the Planned Purchase and Planned Supply of Grain." Failure to criticize some practices that violate policies and instead blindly publicize them will inevitably cause confusion in policy thinking and practical work. Newspapers should be skilled propagandists of the party and government's policies, and any similar deviations are not allowed.

    Paying attention to publicizing the economic lives of the masses and making newspapers truly become the party's powerful assistant in solving the economic life problems of the masses is an important issue that many of our newspapers have not solved well. If we say that our newspapers have not been very concerned about the economic lives of the masses in the past and also lack publicity experience in this area, then we should attach great importance to and do a good job in the publicity of rural grain markets, and draw experience from it to improve the newspapers' publicity work on the vital economic lives of the masses.

专栏：报纸工作述评

    报纸工作述评加强关于农村粮食市场的宣传张　浅
    建立在国家领导下没有私商参加的新型农村粮食市场，是深入贯彻国家粮食政策并关系到广大农民切身经济生活的重要措施。注意宣传这种农村粮食市场的政治经济意义，及时揭露工作中的各种问题，指出前进的方向，把广大农民吸引到这种市场的活动中来，这是各地报纸特别是以农民为主要对象的报纸的一个重要的任务。
    近几个月来，大行政区一级报纸和以农民为主要对象的省级报纸，多数是比较重视这一宣传的，并在推动建立农村粮食市场的工作上，作了一定的努力。但也有不少报纸宣传得还很不深入，只注意反映市场交易的数字，却很少深入反映粮食市场工作中的问题和建立这种市场后对农村经济生活的影响。甚至有少数报纸，对这一宣传工作极不重视，宣传得很不经常，很不及时。因此，加强有关农村粮食市场的宣传，使之能够和工作的需要相适应，已成为许多报纸当前需要解决的一个问题。
    加强关于农村粮食市场宣传的一个重要方面，就在于全面地说明这种市场的政治意义和经济意义。这就是要通过本地区的具体事例，说明粮食统购统销后自由市场的变化，说明国家的粮食政策，说明建立新型粮食市场对农民互通有无、活跃农村经济、调剂供需关系等方面的意义，从思想上教育干部和农民，认识建立农村粮食市场的重要性和迫切性。进行这一宣传时，报纸必须具体说明：由于国家工业生产的发展、城市工矿地区人口不断增加和经济作物生产的相应发展，粮食的需要量比过去增多。因之农民在统购粮食以后把多余的粮食拿到市场出售，帮助缺粮户解决困难，就能减少国家的粮食供应量，使国家能有更多的粮食来保证城乡人民的需要，这对国家的社会主义建设十分有利。同时，设立这种市场后，余粮户可将出售粮食得来的钱投入生产，缺粮户可以买到必需的粮食，另外有的农民在市场上可以掉换到需要的粮食品种，或者进行临时性的周转。而由于这种市场打击了粮食黑市的活动，农民在市场交易不再受投机粮商的剥削，就能使农民的利益进一步得到保护。在这一方面，以浙江日报作得比较好。浙江日报在阐明这些意义时，曾以通俗形式的文章，比较全面地解释了什么是新型的粮食市场、成立新型的粮食市场对国家对农民有哪些好处、农民对它应该抱什么态度等问题。显然，通过这一宣传，把群众切身利益和国家建设利益联系起来，使广大干部和群众了解这种市场既适合农民的习惯和要求、又符合国家需要的道理，就能提高他们的认识，推动他们积极地参加这一工作。
    加强关于农村粮食市场宣传的另一个重要方面，就是要针对干部和群众的各种思想顾虑和不正确的作法，进行细致的说服教育和批判。因为，当干部和群众的政策思想水平还没有提高到一定程度的时候，他们不仅在思想上会有许多问题和顾虑，而且干部在工作上也会碰到许多困难甚至出偏差。解释这些问题，解除这些顾虑，批评错误的作法并指出正确的作法，这就是报纸的责任。报纸在向干部和群众进行思想教育时，应通过言论和消息，针对干部认为实行粮食统购统销后，粮食供应应由国家“包下来”，建立粮食市场是“找麻烦”的思想，和怕这种市场会变成“自由市场”的顾虑；以及农民认为“现在卖粮不光荣”、怕受讽刺打击、“卖粮容易买粮难”等等顾虑，进行充分的分析和批判。报纸一方面应向干部说明：经过粮食的计划收购，国家并没有把农民的余粮全部收购下来，计划供应也不可能完全满足农民多方面的需要。如果硬要“包下来”，不组织农民之间的有无相通，就必然引起农村经济的部分呆滞，迫使农民向投机商人求助，为粮食的投机活动留下很大的空隙，结果是招致了真正的麻烦，造成不可补偿的损失。而通过农村粮食市场以补助统购统销工作之不足，加强市场管理以打击投机粮商的活动，正足以防止农村自发势力的发展。一方面又应向农民说明：余粮户在这种市场上售出粮食支援困难的乡邻，是正当的，政府对这种正当的交易行为是鼓励和保护的；进行粮食的投机则是可耻的，为政府和人民所不允许的。而对于缺粮户所必需的粮食，国家任何时候都会负责供给的。上海解放日报、山东大众日报、新湖南报、浙江日报等，都曾抓住了这个主要之点，进行了适当的解释和批判。这样作，对推动建立农村粮食市场的工作，是十分有益的。
    报纸不仅要注意解除干部和群众的思想顾虑，还需要向他们指明什么是错误的作法，什么是正确的作法。有些报纸针对干部在建立市场中产生迟迟不前或对市场不加领导放任自流的现象，以及在建立市场中所发生的新的偏向，进行了批判。例如：山东大众日报以济宁等四个专区的一些地区自发粮食市场的数目大大超过国家粮食市场的事例，有力地指出：必须迅速纠正迟迟不前的状态，和对自发市场采取积极领导和改造的方针的必要性。新湖南报对衡山县采取以高价吸引粮食上市，浙江日报对平阳县宜山镇粮食市场允许私商参加交易的违反政策的现象，都进行了批判。另外有些报纸，又及时地介绍了好的工作经验。如甘肃日报表扬了泾川县窑店区粮食市场通过工农业产品价格对比的方法，宣传粮价不稳只对少数投机商有利、使大多数农民吃亏的道理，因而在最初上市粮食不多的情况下，教育说服了卖粮农民不应抬高粮价。浙江日报、河南日报也分别介绍了金华专区、扶沟县崔桥区迅速开展粮食市场工作的经验。上述报纸不仅迅速传播了各种好的工作经验；而且通过对各种错误思想和作法的批判，帮助干部和群众正确地划清思想界限和政策界限，使他们能迅速地改正错误。
    为了加强关于建立农村粮食市场的宣传工作，除了应注意上述的一些问题外，还需要改善我们的宣传方法，注意选择和结合当地的各种典型事例，进行生动而具体的宣传。事实上，随着这种新型市场的大量建立，农民在思想上、经济生活上正在或已经引起新的变化。在报纸上具体地反映这些新的变化与新的气象，这就是一种最有力的活的教育。有些报纸反映了这一方面的一些情况。例如：山西日报报道了潞城县中村乡建立了粮食市场后，农民们说：“有了市场心不慌，啥时缺啥时还能买。”原来要求国家供应粮食的四百户中，就有二百户自动除了名，减轻了国家的供应负担。上海解放日报报道了山东德县第四区棉农孙明玉，原先怕粮食不好买，准备留下七亩棉花地种粮食，粮食市场建立后，他立即把这七亩地种上了棉花。虽然报纸上的这样的例子还不多，已有的报道也都比较简单，但因为它们反映了农民认识的提高和对市场的信任，反映了农民积极扩大生产的实际行动以及和粮商进行斗争的决心，这就能教育干部和群众具体地认识到建立这种市场的重要意义，并且在群众中树立榜样，从而鼓舞人们参加这种市场活动的积极性。报纸的这种作法，无疑是值得提倡的。
    但是，从过去几个月的宣传情况看来，有些报纸在这一宣传中还存在一些缺点，并因此影响了报纸在深入贯彻国家粮食政策中的作用。首先是，有少数报纸几月来就很少进行这一方面的报道，或者即使报道也不够及时。例如，辽西、热河两省早在四月间已开始重点建立农村粮食市场。但在此以后，东北大部分区村却迟迟未建立这种市场，有些地区一直都在慢慢地进行“试点”工作。东北日报七月一日对此提出了批评，这是应该的。但是该报在东北全区农村粮食市场开辟比较迟缓的情况下，没有及时提出批评，说明这一工作的重要性，引起各级党、政领导机关的注意，推动这一工作。报纸不及时反映建立农村粮食市场中的情况和问题，自然也就不能有力地推动这一工作前进。
    其次，不少报纸很少注意阐明建立这种新型粮食市场是国家粮食政策的一个组成部分，是国家粮食统购统销的补助力量的意义。另外有少数报纸，虽然说到了粮食市场的意义，但只讲对农民的好处，不讲对国家的好处；或者着重讲了对农民生活上的好处，强调通过它可以满足农民的“口味”，使农民吃得好，却很少讲对生产上的好处。这样，报道中不注意说明建立这种市场的意义，固然不能从思想上发动干部和群众来重视这一工作；而对它的意义作了不全面的宣传，也同样不能收到动员农民积极参加这一工作的成效。
    再次，有的报纸还放弃或放松了对错误的思想和作法进行必要的斗争。有时候，报纸接触或提出了一些尖锐的问题，却没有使问题得到解决。例如西安群众日报在四月十六日一篇报道中说，陕西省中部地区建立农村粮食市场的工作进行得不够好，原因之一是有些干部怕建立市场后，收下粮食增加自己的保管和处理的责任，因此对建立粮食市场的工作抱着消极的态度。但是，为什么干部的这一错误认识，成了这一地区建立市场的一个阻碍？这种认识和消极态度的错误何在？正确的解决办法又是什么？报纸却没有交代。报纸不及时提出阻碍工作前进的问题加以分析批判，就减弱了它在指导实际中的作用。自然，更不好的是有的报纸还对政策作了不正确的宣传。吉林日报五月十一日在一篇报道中说，在乾安县的粮食市场上，“卖粮的都是农民，买粮的都是职工家属、市民、机关食堂等。”机关人员需用的粮食，一律由国家粮食部门通过这些机关的组织有计划地予以供应，这在政务院“关于实行粮食的计划收购和计划供应的命令”中早有规定。报纸对一些违反政策的作法不加批评，反而盲目地加以宣传，就必然在政策思想和实际工作中引起混乱。报纸应该是党和政府的政策的熟练的宣传者，任何类似的偏差，都是不能容许的。
    注意宣传群众经济生活的问题，使报纸真正成为党在解决群众经济生活问题中的有力助手，这是我们许多报纸所没有很好地解决的一个重要问题。如果说我们报纸过去还不很关心群众的经济生活，也还缺乏这一方面的宣传经验，那末，我们就应该十分重视并作好农村粮食市场的宣传，从中取得经验，来改进报纸关于群众切身经济生活的宣传工作。
