    Over Three Thousand Graduates from Wuhan Universities to Start Working
    A total of more than three thousand graduates from eight universities in Wuhan will participate in national construction projects in August. The newly established Central China Institute of Technology and Wuhan River Transportation College both have their first graduating classes this year. The inland river shipping talents cultivated by Wuhan River Transportation College are the first batch of specialized inland river shipping talents cultivated by Chinese universities.
    Before graduation, graduates from various universities participated in graduation internships lasting about one month. Graduates from Central China Normal College conducted educational internships in thirteen secondary schools in Hubei Province and Wuhan City. More than 400 graduates from Central China Institute of Technology interned in relevant factories and enterprises in Shenyang, Zhengzhou, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Nanjing, and other places. The internships proved that the academic performance of this year's graduates is excellent. More than 200 graduates from the Hydraulic Engineering Specialty of the Wuhan University Water Conservancy College conducted graduation internships at the Nanwan Reservoir in the Huai River Project. They directly participated in the operation of eighteen types of work and completed their graduation internship reports with excellent results. During the internship at the Nanwan Reservoir, graduates from the Wuhan University Water Conservancy College also put forward many rationalization proposals, many of which have been valued by the Nanwan Reservoir Engineering Headquarters, and some have been adopted and implemented. This year, graduates from various universities demonstrated a spirit of love for labor and hard work during their internships, and were praised and commended by the employees of their respective internship units.
