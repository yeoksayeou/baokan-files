Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 21st. The Central-South China Flood and Drought Control Headquarters issued instructions on the 20th, requiring all regions to further improve flood control work and strive for victory in the final stage of flood control. The instructions stated: During this flood season in the Central-South region, due to special meteorological changes, there has been excessive rainfall, large amounts of precipitation, high water levels, and long durations. However, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party committees and People's Governments at all levels, and the long-term arduous struggle of all flood control personnel, the floods have been basically overcome, ensuring the safety of the main dikes such as the Jingjiang Dike of the Yangtze River and the Yao Dike of the Han River, as well as important cities such as Wuhan and Huangshi, playing a certain role in guaranteeing the country's socialist construction. The achievements in flood control are significant. The selfless labor and heroic struggle of the flood control personnel throughout the region have been supported, praised, and respected by the people of the whole country. Now, the flood season in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces is nearing its end, but coastal areas still need to strengthen their defenses against typhoons. The flood season in the rivers within Hunan and Jiangxi provinces will also end, but Dongting and Poyang Lakes are directly affected by the Yangtze River, and the flood season has not yet passed. Within Hubei, although the major flood has passed, the autumn flood has only just begun. Even if there is no more rising water upstream, the amount of water stored in the low-lying areas and lakes along the river is large, and the water level cannot drop quickly in the short term. Generally speaking, the current improvement in the weather and the decline in water levels are favorable conditions for flood control; however, the dikes have been soaked for a long time, reducing their flood resistance, cadres and the masses are tired from long battles, the waterlogging situation in some areas is relatively severe, most dikes are facing water on both sides, making it difficult to obtain soil, and after autumn, cold waves will move south, with generally strong winds. These are all unfavorable factors for future flood control work, and we must have sufficient understanding and estimation. According to past experiences in various regions, the possibility of breaches occurring during the receding water period is very high. In previous struggles, we have overcome many major objective difficulties, and thus achieved brilliant victories. In order to consolidate the achievements already made and strive for greater and final victory, it is hoped that the flood control army and the broad masses of people in all regions will continue to be vigilant, keep abreast of the situation, overcome any erroneous ideas of paralysis and relaxation that have been or may be caused by receding water and fatigue, continue to carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism and patriotism, make persistent efforts, strive to make contributions, establish the determination to win the final victory, maintain a full fighting spirit of repeated battles and repeated victories, in order to complete the glorious and arduous flood control task.

    中南区防汛防旱总指挥部发布指示
    号召争取防汛最后阶段的胜利
    【新华社武汉二十一日电】中南区防汛防旱总指挥部在二十日发布指示，要求各地进一步做好防汛工作，争取防汛最后阶段的胜利。指示说：中南区今年汛期，由于气象变化特殊，以致降雨多，雨量大，水位高，持续时间久。但由于中共各级党委和人民政府的正确领导，全体防汛工作人员长期的艰苦斗争，基本上战胜了洪水，确保了长江荆江大堤和汉水遥堤等主要干堤和武汉、黄石等重要城市的安全，对国家社会主义建设起了一定的保证作用。防汛成绩是很大的。全区防汛人员忘我的劳动精神与英勇斗争已获得了全国人民的支援、赞扬和尊敬。现在广东、广西两省的汛期将近终了，但是沿海一带还须加强对台风的防范。湖南、江西两省境内各河的汛期也将结束，但是洞庭、鄱阳两湖直接受长江的影响，汛期还没有过去。湖北境内，大汛虽然过去，秋汛还只开始。即使上游不再涨水，沿江洼地和湖泊储蓄的水量很多，水位不可能在短期内很快下降。总的说来，目前天气好转，水位回落，是防汛的有利条件；但是，堤身浸泡已久，抗洪力减低，干部和群众久战疲劳，部分地区水涝灾情较重，大部堤防两面临水，取土不易，入秋以后，寒潮即将南下，风力一般强大等，都是今后防汛工作的不利因素，必须有足够的认识和估计。根据以往各地的经验，在退水时期发生溃决的可能性是很大的。在以前的斗争中，我们已经克服了客观上很多重大的困难，因而取得了辉煌的胜利。为了巩固已得的成绩和争取更大的、最后的胜利，希各地防汛大军和广大人民继续提高警惕，随时掌握险情，克服因退水与疲劳所已产生的和可能产生的任何错误的麻痹松懈等思想，继续发挥革命英雄主义和爱国主义的精神，再接再厉，争取立功，树立最后必胜的决心，保持屡战屡胜的饱满战斗情绪，以完成光荣的、艰巨的防汛任务。
