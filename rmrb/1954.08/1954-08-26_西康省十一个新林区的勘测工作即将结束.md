Survey work on eleven new forest areas in Xikang Province, located in the counties of Yingjing, Tianquan, Shimian, Baoxing, and Jiulong, which began in March and April of this year, is nearing completion. Preliminary statistics indicate that these eleven forest areas cover a total area of more than 10,000 hectares, with substantial timber reserves. The majority of the trees are fir, spruce, and hemlock that are around a century old, with excellent wood quality suitable for railroad ties, pit props, and other important building materials. Logging and transportation conditions are also favorable. Once extracted, these resources will play an important role in supporting basic construction in various parts of Southwest China.

In order to better fulfill the tasks assigned to them by the state, all members of the forest surveying team have been actively studying technology and continuously improving their working methods, developing numerous methods to improve surveying quality and accelerate surveying speed. For example, in tree measurement, the number of trees measured per person per day increased from over one hundred to three hundred. These surveyed forest areas are mostly located in high and cold regions above 2,000 meters above sea level, with heavy fog and rain, and a cold climate. However, the surveying team members devised many methods to ensure that work could continue as usual even in rainy and foggy weather. In their work, they also paid attention to respecting the customs and habits of the local ethnic minorities, and actively promoted the relationship between forest logging and national construction to the masses. People of all ethnic groups actively helped them with directions, transporting materials, and maintaining law and order. The Yi people of Shimian County actively reported information to the forest surveying team, which led to the discovery of several new forest areas.

    西康省十一个新林区的勘测工作即将结束
    西康省荥经、天全、石棉、宝兴、九龙等县十一个新林区的勘测工作，从今年三四月份开始，最近即将全部结束。据初步统计，这十一个林区的面积共有一万多公顷，木材蓄积量相当丰富，大多是百年上下的冷杉、云杉、铁杉等，木质优良，可作枕木、坑木及其他重要建筑材料，开伐、运输条件也好。将来开采出来后，对于支援西南各地的基本建设将起重要作用。
    森林勘测队的全体工作人员，为了更好地完成国家交给自己的任务，都积极钻研技术，不断地改进工作方法，在工作中研究出许多提高勘测质量和加快勘测速度的方法。以测树为例，就由每人每天测一百多棵提高到三百棵。这些被勘测的林区差不多都在拔海二千公尺以上的高寒地带，雾大雨多，气候寒冷，但勘测队员们想出许多办法，使得在有雨雾的天气中也能照常进行工作。他们在工作中还注意尊重当地少数民族人民的风俗习惯，并积极向群众宣传开伐森林与国家建设的关系。各族人民主动帮助他们带路，搬运物资，维持治安。石棉县的彝族人民还积极向森林勘测队报告情况，使得森林勘测队发现了几个新的林区。
