    State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory Begins Production
    China's first modern textile machinery manufacturing plant—the State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory—has officially started production. This new factory, which produces equipment for 500,000 spindles annually, has a large machine workshop of 29,900 square meters and a casting workshop of 12,000 square meters, as well as auxiliary workshops for electromechanical, stamping, tool, and heat treatment. All machinery and equipment are modern and automated.
    While constructing the factory, a large number of production personnel were trained, and complex new product designs and trial production work were carried out.
    Now this factory has officially been put into production and will produce a large number of excellent spinning machines to equip China's newly built textile factories. *Shanxi Daily* manuscript, photo by Liang Yi
    Master worker Chen Genrong (first person on the left) explains the structure and operating principles of the lathe to students from the Mechanical Manufacturing Department of Tsinghua University who are interning at the factory, in front of a Soviet four-axis automatic lathe. This is a spinning machine produced by the factory.
    On the day of the opening ceremony, representatives of the inter-factory competition of textile factories in the North China region visited the assembly workshop. Assembly workers are installing "Type 1182 carding machines."
    This is the mechanized casting workshop of the State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory.

    国营经纬纺织机械厂开工生产
    我国第一座现代化纺织机械制造厂——国营经纬纺织机械厂已正式开工生产。这座年产五十万纱锭设备的新型工厂，拥有两万九千九百平方公尺的大机工场和一万二千平方公尺的铸工场，还有机电、冲压、工具、热处理等附属车间。所有机器设备都是现代化、自动化的。
    在建厂的同时还培养了大批生产人员，进行了复杂的新产品设计和试制工作。
    现在这座工厂已正式投入生产，将生产出大量优良的纺纱机器，装备我国新建的纺织工厂。山西日报稿　梁　毅摄
