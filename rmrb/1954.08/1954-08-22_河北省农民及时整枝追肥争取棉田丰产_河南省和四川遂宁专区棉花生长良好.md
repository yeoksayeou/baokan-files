Hebei Province farmers are vigorously strengthening late-stage field management to strive to complete the cotton production increase plan. Currently, cotton fields in general areas have been hoed four or five times. At the same time, many farmers have applied topdressing fertilizer to their cotton fields, and many cotton fields have been topdressed twice. In Ji County, Zhengding, Yi County, Laiishui and other counties, the area of topdressing has reached 60 percent. In the high-yield cotton area of ​​Ji County, 80 percent of the cotton fields have been fertilized. In order to ensure the realization of the production increase plan, farmers in various places have paid attention to improving topdressing technology. Many farmers have adopted methods of hole application and ditch application. At present, in addition to applying coarse fertilizer, farmers in various places are also adding quick-acting fertilizers to avoid the phenomenon of late cotton maturity.

　　The pruning and topping work of cotton in various cotton-producing areas has generally been carried out two or three times. This year, due to climate imbalance and late cotton development, the vast number of farmers are generally promoting pruning techniques of first removing the top shoots, then removing the cluster shoots, and appropriately retaining fruit branches, so as to concentrate nutrients, supply flowering and boll formation, and promote early cotton maturity. By the beginning of August, most of the cotton in Tongxian, Xingtai and other prefectures had been topped, and they are continuing to remove cluster shoots. In Dingxing County, after three prunings of 270,000 mu of cotton, the top shoots and lower cluster shoots have been removed. Generally, the cotton stalks are three feet high, with more than eight fruit branches and more than fifteen flower buds. Now farmers are removing the middle cluster shoots to consolidate the growth of cotton bolls.

    In Henan Province, cotton has generally grown to a foot and a half to two feet tall, with eight to ten fruit branches and four to seven bolls. According to reports from Puyang, Xinxiang, Anyang, Shangqiu, Luoyang and other prefectures, there is confidence in exceeding the production increase plan. Xinxiang Prefecture reported that this year's cotton has tall stalks, short nodes, many bolls, and little shedding. It is estimated that good cotton can yield 150 to 200 jin per mu, and general cotton can yield more than 100 jin per mu. The cotton in Puyang Prefecture is better than in previous years. According to a survey of four agricultural production cooperatives and one mutual aid group in Puyang County, among 325 mu of cotton, 115 mu can yield 400 to 500 jin. The Bo'ai Mechanized Farm has more than 4,100 mu of cotton, which has been cultivated four times and pruned twice. It is now more than two feet tall and is estimated to yield 200 jin per mu, an increase of 25 percent compared with 160 jin per mu last year. The Anyang Cotton Farm has cultivated the cotton ten times and treated insects five times. All employees are confident in completing the production increase plan of 220 jin per mu. Wheat stubble cotton in Puyang, Luoyang, Nanyang and other prefectures is also growing well. The masses reported: "The cotton is good this year, and even the late-sown flowers are being planted!"

    In Suining Prefecture, the main cotton-producing area of Sichuan Province, 1.06 million mu of cotton is growing well. This year, the cotton stalks are more robust than last year, all more than two feet tall, and are generally flowering, budding, and forming bolls. Cotton farmers expect this year's cotton harvest to be comparable to 1951, the highest-yielding year in recent years.

    This year, cotton farmers in Suining Prefecture responded to the government's call and expanded the cotton planting area by more than 90,000 mu compared with last year. After the cotton was sown, the cotton farmers continuously fought against insect pests. When the cotton just emerged from the soil, it was harmed by cotton aphids, followed by red spiders, bollworms and other insect pests. When insect pests occurred, the mutual aid and cooperative organizations led the surrounding farmers to control the pests. Generally, the cotton fields were treated with pesticides twice, and some were treated five times. When cotton aphids were harmful, seven agricultural production cooperatives in Shehong County led the surrounding farmers to use more than 100 sprayers to spray more than 5,000 mu of cotton fields, which greatly reduced the damage from pests. Recently, in addition to continuing to strengthen field management, cotton farmers in various places are mainly carrying out cotton boll protection work, draining accumulated water from cotton fields, and preventing boll rot losses caused by waterlogging.

    河北省农民及时整枝追肥争取棉田丰产
    河南省和四川遂宁专区棉花生长良好
    河北省广大农民大力加强田间后期管理，争取完成棉花增产计划。目前一般地区的棉花已锄到四、五遍。同时，很多农民都给棉田施了追肥，不少棉田已经追过两次肥料。冀县、正定、易县、涞水等县，追肥的面积已达到百分之六十。冀县的良棉区已有百分之八十的棉田施了追肥。为保证实现增产计划，各地农民注意了改进追肥的技术，许多农民采取了穴施和开沟施肥的方法。当前各地农民除追施粗肥外，还正加施速效肥料，以避免棉花晚熟的现象。
    各产棉区的棉花整枝打杈工作，一般已进行了两、三遍。今年因为气候失调，棉花发育晚，广大农民正普遍推行先打顶尖，后打群尖，适当留果枝的整枝技术，以便集中养分，供给开花结铃，促使棉花早熟。到八月初，通县、邢台等专区的棉花，大部打完了顶尖，现正继续打群尖。定兴县的二十七万亩棉花，经过三次整枝，已打了顶尖和下部群尖，一般棉棵都留有三尺高，果枝留到八个以上，花蕾留有十五个以上。现在农民正在打中部群尖，以巩固棉铃成长。
                ×××
    河南省的棉花，目前一般已长到尺半至二尺多高，果枝八至十个，成铃四至七个。据濮阳、新乡、安阳、商邱、洛阳等专区反映，有把握超额完成增产计划。新乡专区反映，今年的棉花是株高、节短、桃多、脱落少，较好的棉花，估计每亩可收一百五十至二百斤，一般的可收一百斤以上。濮阳专区的棉花，比往年都好，据濮阳县四个农业生产合作社、一个互助组的调查，三百二十五亩棉花中，能收四百至五百斤的已有一百一十五亩。博爱机耕农场，四千一百多亩棉花，经过四次中耕、两次整枝，现长二尺多高，估计每亩可收二百斤，比去年每亩一百六十斤增产百分之二十五。安阳棉场，棉花已中耕十次、治虫五次，全体职工都有信心完成每亩二百二十斤的增产计划。濮阳、洛阳、南阳等专区，麦茬棉花，亦都生长良好。群众反映说：“今年棉花好，种晚花的也种着啦！”
    四川省棉花主要产地遂宁专区，一百零六万亩棉花生长情况良好。今年棉株比去年茁壮，都已有两尺多高，普遍开花现蕾结桃。棉农们预期今年棉花收成，可以和近年来产量最高的一九五一年相比较。
    今年遂宁专区棉农响应政府号召，比去年扩大植棉面积九万多亩。棉花播种后，棉农们即连续和虫害作斗争。棉花刚出土时有棉蚜虫为害，接着又出现红蜘蛛、红铃虫等虫害。在虫害发生时，互助合作组织即带动周围农民治虫，一般都把棉田治虫两道，多的还治了五道。射洪县七个农业生产合作社在棉蚜虫为害时，带动周围农民用一百多部喷雾器喷射五千多亩棉田，使虫害大为减轻。最近，各地棉农除继续加强田间管理外，主要是进行保护棉桃工作，排除棉田积水，防止因水涝而产生烂桃的损失。
