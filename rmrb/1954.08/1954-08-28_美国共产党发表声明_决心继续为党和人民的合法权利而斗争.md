Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 27th: According to TASS, the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement to the press condemning the decree banning the activities of the Communist Party of the United States.

    The statement pointed out that the enactment of the decree banning communist activities and placing new shackles on American trade unions is a step towards a police state. This anti-communist decree has seriously damaged the honor and prestige of the United States in the eyes of the world. The world is moving towards consultation and peaceful coexistence of two systems, but the political leaders of the United States are trying to step up the "Cold War."

    The statement said: "People all over the world believe that this anti-communist decree is a reprint of the decrees of Hitler and Mussolini… This decree is based on Hitler's outrageous lies, saying that the Communist Party is instigating and advocating the overthrow of the government by force. This is a complete fabrication."

    The statement said: "We call on all Americans who uphold the Constitution to unite and fight for the abolition of this appalling decree. We communists will continue to fight for peace, democracy, people's welfare, and the rights of labor and black people."

    The statement said: "Our party has not been intimidated by this new act of suppression... Under any circumstances, the Communist Party will continue to work and fight for its own legitimate existence. The Communist Party is not only fighting for its own rights, but also for the Bill of Rights of all Americans."

    美国共产党发表声明
    决心继续为党和人民的合法权利而斗争
   【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：美国共产党向报界发表声明，谴责禁止美国共产党活动的法令。
    声明指出，禁止共产党活动和给美国工会套上新的枷锁的法令的生效，是走向警察国家的一个步骤。这个反共法令使美国在全世界面前严重损失了它的荣誉和威望。世界正走着协商和两种制度和平共处的道路，但是美国的政治首脑却在竭力加紧进行“冷战”。
    声明说：“全世界人民认为这个反共法令是希特勒和墨索里尼的法令的再版……这个法令是以希特勒的漫天大谎作依据的，它说什么共产党在策动和鼓吹用武力推翻政府。这是彻头彻尾的捏造。”
    声明说：“我们号召一切拥护宪法的美国人团结起来，为废除这一骇人听闻的法令进行斗争。我们共产党人将继续为和平、民主、人民福利、劳工与黑人的权利而斗争。” 
    声明说：“我们党没有被这种新的镇压行动吓倒……无论在什么情况下，共产党都将继续工作，并为自身的合法存在而斗争。共产党不仅是在为自己的权利，而且是在为全体美国人的权利法案而斗争。”
