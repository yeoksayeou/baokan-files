Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the instigation of the American authorities, is intensifying its piratical activities of attacking and intercepting merchant ships. According to foreign news agencies, the British merchant ship "Inchkilda" was again bombarded on the 24th by a Chiang Kai-shek bandit warship near the Matsu Islands off the coast of Fujian, which are occupied by Chiang bandits.

The "Inchkilda" was previously damaged by gunfire from three Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships in July of last year. In addition, two other British merchant ships, "Inchstrey" and "Inchjofa", were recently illegally intercepted and inspected by Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships on the waters of the Taiwan Strait.

    蒋匪袭击和拦劫英国商船
   【新华社二十六日讯】蒋介石卖国集团在美国当局的指使下，正加紧进行袭击和拦劫商船的海盗活动。据外国通讯社报道，英国商船“英契基尔达号”二十四日又在福建沿海蒋匪盘踞的马祖岛附近遭到一艘蒋匪军舰的轰击。
  “英契基尔达号”在去年七月曾被三艘蒋匪军舰开炮击伤。另外二艘英国商船“英契斯雷号”和“英乔伐号”也在最近在台湾海峡的海面上遭到蒋匪军舰非法拦截和盘查。
