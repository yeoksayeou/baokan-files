Several Issues Concerning the Socialist Transformation of Handicrafts
    ——Report at the Third National Handicraft Production Cooperative Conference of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, December 17, 1953 (Abstract)
    Cheng Zihua, Acting Director of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives

    I.

    The socialist transformation of handicrafts is an integral part of the general task of the transition period and an integral part of national socialist industrialization. Why is it necessary to carry out socialist transformation of handicrafts? Because handicraftsmen are laborers on the one hand and private owners on the other. Handicraft production is scattered, backward, conservative, and blind. Without socialist transformation, its relations of production cannot be changed, its production cannot be brought into the orbit of national planning, its backward mode of production cannot be changed into a modern mode of production and its productivity improved, and handicraftsmen cannot be led from a state of poverty to one of affluence.

    The development of handicrafts from small-scale production to large-scale production is an inevitable process. There are two different paths to complete this process: one is the capitalist path, and the other is the socialist path. The capitalist path is that a few handicraftsmen develop into capitalists, and the majority of handicraftsmen are exploited by industrial capital and commercial capital, becoming sacrifices of the development of large industry, thus becoming impoverished, bankrupt, and reduced to the proletariat. This is a painful path. The socialist path is to gradually transform handicraftsmen from decentralized production to collective production, gradually change private ownership into collective ownership, becoming the collective economy of cooperatives; with the help of socialist large industry, gradually change handicraft tool production into semi-mechanized and mechanized production, so that handicraftsmen move from poverty to prosperity, becoming an integral part of socialist construction.

    As far as the current situation in our country is concerned, the needs for handicrafts are very urgent in several aspects. First, the means of production needed by peasants and handicraftsmen; second, the consumer goods needed by residents in various places that large industries cannot yet manufacture or whose production is insufficient; third, the processing industry for agricultural products; fourth, the repair industry and small-scale manufacturing industry serving large industries. It can be affirmed that handicrafts have a wide range of functions and a promising future in our country.

    After the victory of our country's New Democratic Revolution, it opened up a bright path for handicraftsmen to move towards socialism through cooperation. Under the leadership of the Party and the support of the government, and through the efforts of handicrafts production cooperative workers and some handicraftsmen, by the end of 1953, there were approximately 4,806 handicrafts production cooperatives with more than 298,000 members, with a total annual output value of 52,000 billion yuan. According to incomplete estimates, the average annual output value per individual handicraftsman is 4.9 million yuan, while the average annual output value per member of a handicrafts production cooperative is 17 million yuan. This shows the superiority of handicrafts after cooperation. Handicrafts can achieve the following results through cooperation: (1) Gradually change handicrafts' small private ownership into collective ownership, thereby bringing handicrafts production into the orbit of national planning; (2) Cooperate with national industrial construction to further meet the needs of peasants and urban residents for means of production and livelihood; (3) Improve product quality, increase product quantity, improve production technology, and reduce production costs; (4) Train apprentices in a shorter time to help the state train technical workers; (5) Improve and enhance the material and cultural life of handicraftsmen.

    II.

    According to the experience of the socialist transformation of handicrafts over the past four years, it has been proven that handicrafts production cooperatives must be formed by the voluntary association of handicraftsmen, and it is absolutely forbidden to force them to join the cooperatives. Members must directly participate in labor and cannot only contribute capital as shares. The principle of transforming handicrafts should be active leadership and steady progress; implement the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. The methods and steps for transforming handicrafts should be to start with supply and marketing and implement production transformation; from small to large, from low-level to high-level: that is, from handicrafts supply and marketing production groups, handicrafts supply and marketing production cooperatives to handicrafts production cooperatives.

    (1) Handicrafts supply and marketing production groups. These are organized by independent handicraftsmen or family handicraftsmen through state-owned economy, supply and marketing cooperatives, or consumer cooperatives to supply raw materials and promote finished products through processing and ordering. Handicrafts supply and marketing production groups have not changed the original production relations and are still decentralized production; masters, parents, and owners join the production groups, and their wives, daughters, apprentices, and assistants also participate in production, but they cannot join the production groups. Handicrafts supply and marketing production groups have gotten rid of the exploitation and control of industrial capital, commercial capital, and usury, established contact with the state-owned economy, supply and marketing cooperatives, and consumer cooperatives, obtained supply and marketing support, solved certain difficulties in off-season production, increased output, and increased income.

    (2) Handicrafts supply and marketing production cooperatives. This is a transitional form for carrying out socialist transformation of handicraftsmen. Handicrafts supply and marketing production cooperatives lead a number of production groups, some of which are taken over by supply and marketing cooperatives or consumer cooperatives, and some of which are organized by the supply and marketing production cooperatives themselves. At present, there are the following four types of group forms:

  　The first type is that members directly receive raw materials and submit finished products, decentralize production, and the group leader is only responsible for notifying matters, convening meetings, and educating group members;

    The second type is that the group leader uniformly receives raw materials and submits finished products, decentralizing production;

    The third type is that some links in the production process begin to be centrally produced, while the remaining links are still decentralized production;

    The fourth type is that simple division of labor and cooperation is implemented within the group.

    After organizing handicraftsmen, the first thing to do is to educate them about the socialist future and the articles and principles of the production cooperative; organize institutions similar to product evaluation committees, and democratically stipulate the standards and specifications of products, so that all participants in production join the cooperative (wives, daughters, apprentices, assistants, etc. who participate in production with handicraftsmen are also absorbed into the cooperative). This makes the producers in the cooperative politically equal. This changes the patriarchal and master-apprentice relationship of the first and second types of groups into a certain degree of cooperative relationship.

    Next, carry out the education of "it is not honorable to exploit others," and on the basis of improved production, slightly increase the wages of assistants and apprentices to give full play to their enthusiasm. However, because technology and means of production are in the hands of owners and masters, owners and masters also get more than in the past. At the same time, carry out education on respecting teachers and loving apprentices, sign master-apprentice teaching contracts, and use the public accumulation fund of the supply and marketing production cooperative to purchase some production tools, so as to change some links in the production process into centralized production. This means that the exploitation relationship and production process of the first and second types of groups have been changed, increasing the production enthusiasm and mutual unity and mutual assistance spirit of the members.

    Next, carry out education on simple division of labor and cooperation by group to change the original production units of handicraftsmen. In order to do this well, attention should be paid to the voluntary combination of members, and the main and auxiliary laborers of handicrafts should be appropriately organized (you cannot only want laborers and not auxiliary laborers); according to the level of technology, main labor and secondary labor, implement a wage system based on work. Because specialized production is implemented, this can improve quality and increase output; because division of labor and cooperation is implemented (although the tools are still privately owned), individual products have been changed into collective products, so individual members have no right to sell products, which can prevent the spontaneous trend of members coming in the off-season and leaving in the peak season, selling good products themselves and handing over bad products to the cooperative; thereby also strengthening the relationship between members and the cooperative.

    After completing these aspects of the transformation, the handicrafts supply and marketing production cooperative can transition to the production cooperative. There are two ways to transition: one is that the transformation of a certain supply and marketing production group is faster and has grown stronger, and it has grown from a supply and marketing production cooperative into a production cooperative; the other is that the transformation work of various supply and marketing production groups is generally advancing at the same time, and the supply and marketing production cooperative is entirely transformed into a production cooperative.

    (3) Handicrafts production cooperatives. This is a cooperative factory for collective production by handicraftsmen. It finally changes the private ownership of handicrafts into collective ownership and leads small handicrafts producers onto the socialist road.

    A handicrafts production cooperative is formed by handicraftsmen voluntarily uniting, raising shares, renting production tools, collectively producing, and gradually growing with the help of the state-owned economy, supply and marketing cooperatives, or consumer cooperatives. As the number of people increases, the scale increases, and public accumulation funds are accumulated; another type is transformed by individual handicraftsmen voluntarily uniting through the transformation of supply and marketing production cooperatives.

    The production cooperative first changes handicraftsmen from decentralized production to collective production. Only with collective production is it possible to implement division of labor and cooperation, improve handicraft tools, improve technology, and gradually realize semi-mechanization and mechanization of production; further improve labor productivity, increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, increase members' income, accumulate more public accumulation funds, and expand reproduction. Only in this way can the socialist transformation of handicrafts be finally realized.

    However, due to the different production conditions of handicrafts, concentrated production cannot be implemented indiscriminately and without steps. Some can be fully concentrated in production at once; some can be partially concentrated in production and partially decentralized in production, and then fully concentrated in production when conditions are ripe; some can be mainly concentrated in production and secondary parts in mobile production; some can be concentrated in production when the task is large, and decentralized in production when the task is small; some can be concentrated in production in several locations. However, all handicrafts that can adopt semi-mechanization or mechanization must gradually realize all collective production with the development of production. Only collective production can pave the way for the vigorous development of social productive forces and the large-scale socialization of production.

    III.

    The essence of carrying out socialist transformation of handicraftsmen is to change the private ownership of the means of production. At the beginning of the establishment of the cooperative, because handicraftsmen still have a strong concept of private ownership, the production technology is still very low, and the cooperative has not accumulated much, the means of production cannot be changed to collective ownership all at once; some can be rented, some can be brought by members, and some can be contributed by members as shares. Most handicraftsmen are happy to accept this, and it is beneficial in the initial stage of the establishment of the cooperative, and it can be widely adopted. However, only by changing all or the main means of production to collective ownership can a reasonable division of labor and cooperation be implemented, labor can be rationally organized, and advanced production tools can be adopted as needed. Changing the private ownership of handicraftsmen to the collective ownership of cooperatives is a central issue that every production cooperative worker must pay attention to at all times.

    Can handicraftsmen go through supply and marketing production groups, supply and marketing production cooperatives, and then become semi-socialist production cooperatives, and then further become fully socialist production cooperatives, be a general process of socialist transformation of handicraftsmen? It should be considered that there must be such a process. Because the feudal and exploitative production relations of handicraftsmen, the production process of individual products, and the change of private ownership are impossible without such a process; changing handicraft tools to semi-mechanized and mechanized production is impossible without such a process; changing from decentralized individual production to collective division of labor and cooperation production, and changing from managers of individual production to managers of collective production in cooperative factories, is impossible without such an education and training process. Therefore, we must first develop a large number of supply and marketing production groups and supply and marketing production cooperatives to gradually transition to production cooperatives; at the same time, run production cooperatives well to promote the development of supply and marketing production groups and supply and marketing production cooperatives. The development of supply and marketing production groups and supply and marketing production cooperatives can cultivate the habit of centralized production, find a set of experience in centralized management, and prepare leading backbones, which lays the foundation for organizing production cooperatives.

    But must production cooperatives go through these forms one by one? It is not necessary to do so. Some can go from supply and marketing production groups to supply and marketing production cooperatives to production cooperatives; some can go directly from supply and marketing production groups to production cooperatives; some can go from supply and marketing production cooperatives to production cooperatives; some can directly organize production cooperatives; and some have to stay in the supply and marketing production group or supply and marketing production cooperative stage for a long time. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions, do it from low-level to high-level, from small to large, from simple to complex, according to the forms that are easily accepted by different handicraftsmen. After a period of time, because production cooperatives have been widely developed, a large number of cadres have been trained from among the handicraftsmen, and the production cooperative federations have more public accumulation and experience, it is not necessary to go through various forms, and production cooperatives can be established.

    Semi-mechanization and mechanization are the goals of handicrafts industrialization. Except for some handicrafts production cooperatives that cannot implement semi-mechanization and mechanization in a considerable period of time, most handicrafts production cooperatives can implement them. However, the transition from manual production to mechanized production is an industrial technological revolution, and any lack of preparation or immature conditions, blindly carrying out is wrong.

    After the productivity of the production cooperative is improved, the production cost is reduced, and the quality is improved, it is necessary to lower the selling price and actively expand the public accumulation fund and improve the material and cultural life of the members. The public accumulation fund is the foundation for expanding reproduction. With the increase in production, the proportion of the public accumulation fund should be appropriately increased. The improvement of productivity depends on the enthusiasm and creativity of the members. Every rationalization proposal and invention and creation must be rewarded. The wages and labor returns of all members should be increased accordingly, and welfare and safety facilities should be appropriately increased and improved. Cultural, health, and recreational activities should be carried out with great care. If these tasks are done conscientiously, the members will care about the improvement of productivity, which is the source of productivity improvement.

    At present, in addition to those who have been organized, the situation of handicraftsmen can be divided into three categories: one is individual producers, one is handicraftsmen jointly operating, and one is handicraftsmen jointly operating with handicrafts capitalists.

    Different methods should be adopted for the socialist transformation of these three types of handicraftsmen: the first type has been talked about earlier; for the second type, with their voluntary request, according to their specific situation, help them to transform according to the principles of production cooperatives; for the third type, because they are subject to the exploitation of industrial capital, in the case of widespread publicity of the general task of the state's transition period and the development of handicrafts production cooperatives, it will become a trend for them to break away from joint operations and organize production cooperatives. For example, such a situation has recently occurred in the joint operation of window gauze industry in Beijing, in which small producers have organized supply and marketing production cooperatives, and handicrafts capitalists are discussing joint ventures and taking the road of state capitalism. This decomposition of joint operations will not destroy productivity or the market. On the contrary, because cooperation has liberated labor and improved productivity, it is reasonable and can be guided in the future.

    IV.

    Before liberation, handicraftsmen had difficulties in purchasing raw materials and promoting products due to small capital; industrial capital, commercial capital, and usury controlled their raw material supply and product promotion, making them unable to get rid of the road of poverty and bankruptcy. Since liberation, handicrafts that have established contact with the state-owned economy and cooperative commerce, have gotten rid of these exploitative controls, and have organized cooperatives starting with supply and marketing, have shown a new face.

    In the past, there were serious shortcomings in the combination of production and sales between supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives and handicrafts production cooperatives. First of all, the raw materials supplied to the production cooperative were often of unsuitable quality and untimely; the promotion of the products of the production cooperative was often not active, which affected the production of the production cooperative. Secondly, not understanding that only helping small producers overcome difficulties from the supply and marketing aspect, without carrying out transformation from the production aspect, would promote the blindness of small producers and breed the spontaneous trend of small producers. Thirdly, many supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, under the control of capitalist business ideas, did not take care of the reasonable profits of the production cooperative, and the processing fees were set too low, so that the production cooperative could not have certain accumulation in order to improve production equipment and appropriately increase the wages of the members, resulting in dissatisfaction among small producers, which made it lack power to transform small producers. Fourthly, from the All-China Cooperative Federation to the county cooperatives, they are generally busy with supply and marketing business and rarely manage the work of production cooperatives.

    Can the production cooperative and its higher-level federation establish their own commercial network and fully undertake the task of purchasing raw materials and selling products? It is not possible to do so. Because the production cooperative is a production organization, it should not be an organization that combines production and business, so it should not set up a commercial network for buying and selling. However, grassroots production cooperatives or higher-level federations can set up their own supply and marketing business wholesale institutions and stores. This supply and marketing business institution is for negotiating contracts to purchase raw materials and wholesale products, and this store is for promoting their own products to the people, directly meeting with consumers, so as to directly and quickly listen to consumers' opinions in order to improve their own production.

    In addition to obtaining sources of goods and meeting the needs of residents, it is more important to support the socialist transformation of handicraftsmen for supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives to establish supply and marketing business relations with handicraftsmen or production cooperatives. Starting from this understanding, they should actively supply them with raw materials, promote their products, guide their production according to the needs of the people, and try their best to process orders in the off-season, which not only helps them overcome the difficulties of off-season production, but also reserves the goods needed for the peak season for themselves. In terms of profit distribution, the profit of handicrafts production cooperatives should be higher than the profit of supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives. However, the production cooperative should also ensure the specifications and quality of products and reduce costs. It should be clearly understood that the relationship between supply and marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and production cooperatives is a relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation.

    In addition, the processing and ordering of state-owned industries, state-owned commerce, and military supplies also plays a great role in supporting the cooperation of handicraftsmen. Handicrafts production cooperative workers should strive to do well according to their own possible conditions, these orders guarantee the specifications and quality of products, and strive to reduce costs.

    V.

    In addition to economic transformation, the socialist transformation of handicraftsmen also requires ideological transformation. This transformation requires more work and more time than economic transformation. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously publicize the general task of the transition period to all handicraftsmen and carry out education on the socialist future.

    The transition from handicrafts production to semi-mechanized and mechanized production is impossible without the improvement of technology. To this end, we must do a good job in respecting teachers and loving apprentices, sign master-apprentice teaching contracts; organize technical research meetings, adopt the mass line teaching methods of masters teaching apprentices and members teaching each other; organize advanced and backward people to observe and help each other; organize members to visit state-owned factories, and invite engineers and workers from state-owned factories to guide production in the cooperative.

    In order to learn politics and technology well, special attention must be paid to cultural learning. When production cooperatives have a certain development, consideration should be given to planned rotational training of incumbent cadres and members in secondary technical schools or self-established schools to train leading backbones and technical talents.

    Typical demonstration is also an effective way of education. The dissemination of experience of handicrafts production cooperatives should be appropriate, praising advantages, correcting shortcomings, praising strengths, and correcting weaknesses to avoid one-sidedness. It is called superior only when it is good for producers, the state, and consumers. The superiority of handicrafts production cooperatives is mainly reflected in high labor productivity, good product quality, large quantity, and low cost. In order to prove that the production of handicrafts production cooperatives is better than individual production, therefore, the production cooperatives that have been organized are only allowed to be run well, not badly. At present, especially running handicrafts production cooperatives well should be the focus of our work.

    In order to carry out socialist transformation of handicraftsmen, it is necessary to understand the situation of handicrafts and conduct a nationwide handicrafts survey, but do not adopt the method of issuing forms and do it in every city, county, and township. Adopt industry ranking, typical investigation, but do not conduct a census. Clarify the number of people, the quantity, quality, and production and sales of production. And also find out the situation of apprentices: how many are needed, and whether they are increasing or decreasing.

    The planned control figures for next year have been made and can be used as a basis for arranging work. In order to complete next year's plan, the first thing to do is to systematically and comprehensively summarize the existing supply and marketing production groups, supply and marketing production cooperatives, and production cooperatives, so as to first formulate plans, steps, and methods to improve the existing production cooperative organizations. The existing production cooperative organization is the result of systematically and comprehensively transforming handicrafts and is the basis for our future development. We must cherish the experience of the past few years.

    Now the party committees in various parts of the country are paying more attention to the socialist transformation of handicrafts than in the past, and they are strengthening leadership and strengthening forces, which guarantees the smooth progress of this work. The task is arduous and glorious, and the working conditions are very favorable. Let us all, with a hundredfold confidence, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, resolutely and victoriously implement Chairman Mao's instructions on carrying out socialist transformation of handicrafts.

    关于手工业社会主义改造的若干问题
    ——一九五三年十二月十七日在中华全国合作社联合总社第三次全国手工业生产合作会议上的报告（摘要）
    中华全国合作社联合总社代主任　程子华
    一
    手工业的社会主义改造是过渡时期总任务的一个组成部分，是国家社会主义工业化的一个组成部分。为什么对手工业要进行社会主义改造呢？因为手工业者一方面是劳动者，另一方面又是私有者。手工业生产是分散的、落后的、保守的、盲目的，不进行社会主义改造，就不能改变它的生产关系，就不能把它的生产纳入国家计划轨道，就不能把落后的生产方式改变为近代的生产方式，并提高其生产力，也就不能把手工业者由穷困的状况引到富裕的境地。
    手工业从小生产发展为大生产，是一个必然的过程。完成这个过程有两条不同的道路：一条是资本主义的道路，一条是社会主义的道路。资本主义的道路是少数手工业者发展成为资本家，大多数手工业者受工业资本和商业资本榨取，成为大工业发展的牺牲品，因而穷困、破产，沦为无产阶级，这是一条痛苦的道路。社会主义的道路是使手工业者逐步从分散生产到集体生产，逐步改变私有制为集体所有制，成为合作社的集体经济；在社会主义大工业的帮助下，逐步改变手工工具生产为半机械化、机械化生产，使手工业者由穷困走向富裕，成为社会主义建设的一个组成部分。
    就我国目前情况讲，几个方面对于手工业的需要都是很迫切的，首先是农民和手工业者所需要的生产资料；其次是各地居民所需要而大工业目前还不能制造或生产不足的消费品；第三是农业生产品的加工业；第四是服务于大工业的修理业和小型制造业。可以肯定，在我国手工业有着广泛的作用和远大的前途。
    我国新民主主义革命胜利后，给手工业者开辟了经过合作化走向社会主义的光明道路。四年来在党的领导和政府的扶持下，在手工业生产合作社工作者和部分手工业者的努力下，到一九五三年年终约有手工业生产合作社四千八百零六个，社员二十九万八千余人，全年生产总值五万二千亿元。根据不完全的估算，个体手工业者每人平均年产总值为四百九十万元，手工业生产合作社社员的每人平均年产总值则为一千七百万元。由此可以看出手工业合作化后的优越性。手工业经过合作化还可以达到如下结果：（一）逐步改变手工业的小私有制为集体所有制，从而使手工业生产纳入国家计划轨道；（二）配合国家工业建设，进一步适应农民和城市居民生产和生活资料的需要；（三）提高产品质量，增加产品数量，提高生产技术，降低生产成本；（四）以较快的时间培养学徒，帮助国家培养技术工人；（五）使手工业者的物质和文化生活获得改善和提高。二
    根据四年来手工业社会主义改造的经验证明：手工业生产合作社必须由手工业者自愿联合组成，绝对不能强迫入社。社员必须直接参加劳动，不能只以资金入股。改造手工业的方针，应当是积极领导、稳步前进；贯彻自愿互利原则。改造手工业的方法和步骤，应当是从供销入手，实行生产改造；由小到大，由低级到高级：即由手工业供销生产小组、手工业供销生产合作社到手工业生产合作社。
    （一）手工业供销生产小组。是由独立手工业者或家庭手工业者通过国营经济、供销合作社或消费合作社供给原料，推销成品的加工订货方式组织起来的。手工业供销生产小组还没有改变原有生产关系，仍然是分散生产的；师傅、家长、业主入生产小组，他们的妻、女、学徒、助手虽也参加生产，但还不能入生产小组。手工业供销生产小组摆脱了工业资本、商业资本和高利贷的剥削和控制，与国营经济、供销合作社和消费合作社建立了联系，获得了供销上的扶持，解决了淡季生产的一定困难，增加了产量，增加了收入。
      （二）手工业供销生产合作社。是对手工业者进行社会主义改造的过渡形式。手工业供销生产合作社领导着若干生产小组，这些小组有的是由供销合作社或消费合作社接收过来的，有的是供销生产合作社自己组织的。目前有如下四类小组形式：
  　第一类，社员直接领原料交成品，分散生产，组长只管通知事情，召集开会和对组员的教育工作；
    第二类，组长统一领原料交成品，分散生产；
    第三类，生产过程的部分环节开始集中生产，其余环节仍然分散生产；
    第四类，小组内实行简单的分工协作。
    把手工业者组织起来后，首先要对他们进行社会主义的前途教育，生产合作社章程、原则的教育；组织类似产品评议委员会的机构，民主规定产品的标准、规格，作到参加生产者一律入社（和手工业者一起参加生产的妻、女、学徒、助手等也吸收入社）。使社内生产者在政治上处于平等地位。这就把第一、第二两类小组的家长、师徒关系改变为一定程度的合作关系。
    接着，进行“剥削别人不光荣”的教育，在生产提高的基础上作到稍许增加助手、学徒的工资，以发挥他们的积极性。但因技术和生产资料在业主、师傅手中，使业主、师傅比过去所得也要多些。同时进行尊师爱徒的教育，订立师徒教学合同，并以供销生产合作社的公积金购置部分生产工具，以便把生产过程的部分环节改变为集中生产。这就是第一、第二两类小组的剥削关系和生产过程有所改变，增进了社员的生产积极性和相互之间的团结互助精神。
    接着，按小组为单位进行简单的分工协作的教育，以改变手工业者原有的生产单位。为了做好这一点，要注意社员的自愿结合，把手工业的主要劳动者和辅助劳动者适当加以组织（不能只要劳动者，不要辅助劳动者）；根据技术高低，主要劳动和次要劳动，实行按劳取酬的工资制度。由于实行了专职生产，这就可以提高质量、增加产量；由于实行了分工协作（虽然工具还是私有），已把个人生产品改变为集体生产品，因而社员个人就无权出卖生产品，这就可以阻止社员淡季来旺季走，好的产品自己卖，不好的产品交给合作社的自发趋势的发展；从而也就密切了社员与合作社的关系。
    完成了这些方面的改造后，手工业供销生产合作社就可以过渡到生产合作社。过渡的方法有两种：一种是某一供销生产小组的改造较快，发展壮大了，从供销生产合作社中成长为生产合作社；另一种是各个供销生产小组的改造工作大体齐头并进，供销生产合作社全部改变为生产合作社。
    （三）手工业生产合作社。是手工业者集体生产的合作工厂，它把手工业的私有制最后改变为集体所有制，把手工业小生产者引上了社会主义的道路。
    手工业生产合作社一种是由手工业工人自愿联合起来，凑集股金，租借生产工具，集体生产，在国营经济、供销合作社或消费合作社帮助下，逐步壮大，人数多了，规模大了，积累了公积金，成立起来的；一种是个体手工业者自愿联合，经过供销生产合作社的改造转变过来的。
    生产合作社首先把手工业者由分散生产改变为集体生产。只有集体生产，才有可能实行分工协作，改进手工工具，提高技术，逐步实现半机械化、机械化生产；更大地提高劳动生产率，增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，增加社员收入，积累更多的公积金，扩大再生产。只有这样，才能最后实现对手工业的社会主义改造。
    但由于手工业的生产情况不同，不能不加区别地没有步骤地实行集中生产。有的可以一下子全部集中生产；有的可以一部分集中生产，一部分分散生产，待条件成熟后再全部集中生产；有的可以主要部分集中生产，次要部分巡回生产；有的可以任务大时集中生产，任务小时分散生产；有的可以分几个地点集中生产。但凡是能够采用半机械化或机械化的手工业，也必须随着生产的发展逐步实现全部集体生产，只有集体生产才能给社会生产力的蓬勃发展和生产的大规模社会化铺平道路。三
    对手工业进行社会主义改造的实质是改变生产资料的私有制。在开始建社时，由于手工业者的私有观念还很浓厚，生产技术还很低，合作社还没有多大积累，生产资料不可能一下子改为集体所有；有的可以租用，有的可以由社员带来，有的可以由社员入股。这样作，多数手工业者是乐于接受的，在合作社开始成立阶段是有利的，可以普遍地采用。但只有把全部的或主要的生产资料改变为集体所有制，才能合理的实行分工协作，合理的组织劳动力，根据需要采用进步的生产工具。改变手工业者的私有制为合作社的集体所有制，是每一个生产合作社工作者必须时刻注意的中心问题。
    手工业者经过供销生产小组、供销生产合作社，而后成为半社会主义的生产合作社，再进而成为完全社会主义性质的生产合作社，可不可以成为手工业者社会主义改造的一般过程呢？应该认为是要有这样一个过程的。因为手工业者的封建的剥削的生产关系，个人生产品的生产过程，以及私有制的改变，没有这样一个过程是不可能的；改变手工工具为半机械化、机械化生产，没有这样一个过程是不行的；从分散的个体生产改变为集体的分工协作生产，从个体生产的管理者改变为合作工厂集体生产的管理者，没有这样一个教育培养过程是不行的。因此，首先要大量发展供销生产小组、供销生产合作社，使之逐渐过渡到生产合作社；同时办好生产合作社来推动供销生产小组、供销生产合作社的发展。供销生产小组、供销生产合作社的发展可以培养集中生产的习惯，摸出一套集中经营的经验，准备好领导骨干，这就给组织生产合作社打下了基础。
    但生产合作社是否必须逐次经过这几种形式呢？不一定要这样作。有的可由供销生产小组经供销生产合作社到生产合作社；有的可由供销生产小组直接到生产合作社；有的可由供销生产合作社到生产合作社；有的可直接组织生产合作社；也有的要长期停留在供销生产小组或供销生产合作社阶段。因此必须因地制宜，按照不同手工业者容易接受的形式，由低级到高级、由小到大、由简单到复杂地去做。经过一个时期，由于生产合作社已普遍发展，从手工业者中间已培养出大批干部，生产合作社联合社有了较多公共积累和经验的情况下，就不必经过各种形式，就可以成立生产合作社。
    半机械化、机械化是手工业工业化的奋斗目标。除了某些手工业生产合作社在相当长的时期内不能实行半机械化、机械化外，大部分手工业生产合作社都可以实行。但从手工生产到机械化生产是工业上的技术革命，任何准备不够，条件不成熟，盲目地进行都是错误的。
    生产合作社的生产力提高后，生产成本降低了，质量提高了，就须要降低出售价格，并积极扩大公积金及改善社员的物质生活和文化生活。公积金是扩大再生产的基础，随着生产的增加，公积金的比例应适当提高。生产力的提高依赖于社员的积极性和创造性的发挥，每一个合理化建议和发明创造，都必须给予奖励。全体社员工资和劳动返还金应有相应的增加，福利和安全设施应适当增加和改善，文化、卫生、文娱活动应以极大的关怀去进行。这些工作如果认真做好了，社员就会关心生产力的提高，这是生产力提高的源泉。
    目前手工业者除了已组织起来者外，所处情况可分为三类：一类是个体生产者，一类是手工业者相互联营的，一类是手工业者与手工业资本家联营的。
    对这三类手工业者的社会主义改造工作应采取不同方式：对第一类，前面已讲过了；对第二类，在他们自愿要求下，根据其具体情况，按照生产合作社原则帮助他们改造；对第三类，因为他们受着工业资本的剥削，在国家过渡时期总任务的广泛宣传，和手工业生产合作社发展的情况下，他们脱离联营，组织生产合作社，将会成为趋势。如最近北京市窗纱罗底业联营中就发生了这样情况，其中小生产者已组织了供销生产合作社，手工业资本家正商议合营，走国家资本主义道路。这种联营的分解，不会破坏生产力，破坏市场，相反的，由于合作化使劳动力得到解放，提高了生产力，因而是合理的，今后可以加以引导。四
    解放以前，手工业者因资本小，购买原料和推销产品都有困难；工业资本、商业资本和高利贷控制着他们的原料供应和产品推销，使他们不能摆脱穷困、破产的道路。解放以来，凡是与国营经济、合作社商业发生联系，脱离了这些剥削控制，从供销入手，组织了合作社的手工业，就出现了新的面貌。
    过去供销合作社和消费合作社与手工业生产合作社的产销结合存在有严重的缺点。首先，供给生产合作社的原料，往往质量不合适，时间不及时；推销生产合作社的产品往往不积极，影响了生产合作社的生产。其次，不懂得仅从供销方面帮助小生产者克服困难，不从生产方面进行改造，就会促进了小生产者的盲目性，滋长了小生产者的自发趋势。第三，不少供销合作社和消费合作社在资本主义经营思想支配下，不照顾生产合作社的合理利润，工缴费定的太低，使生产合作社不能有一定积累，以便改进生产设备，适当增加社员工资，结果引起小生产者的不满，就使改造小生产者缺乏力量。第四，从全国合作总社起到县社止，一般忙于供销业务，较少管理生产合作社工作。
    生产合作社和它的上级联合社可不可以建立自己的商业网，完全担负起购买原料和出售产品的任务呢？不可以这样做。因为生产合作社是个生产机构，不应当是一个生产兼营商业的机构，因此，不应当设立商业网以作买卖。但是基层生产合作社或上级联合社可以设立自己的供销业务批发机构和门市部。这种供销业务机构是为了洽订合同以购买原料和批发产品，这种门市部是为了向人民宣传自己的商品，与消费者直接见面，以便直接地迅速地听取消费者的意见，以改进自己的生产。
    供销合作社和消费合作社与手工业者或生产合作社建立供销业务关系，除了为取得货源，满足居民需要外，更重要的是要扶助手工业者的社会主义改造。从这一认识出发，就应积极地供给他们以原料，推销他们的产品，根据人民需要，指导他们生产，并在淡季尽力进行加工订货，既帮助他们克服淡季生产的困难，也为自己储备了旺季需要的商品。在利润分配上，应该手工业生产合作社利润高于供销合作社和消费合作社利润。但生产合作社也应当保证产品的规格质量，降低成本。应该明确的认识，供销合作社、消费合作社与生产合作社之间的关系，是互助合作关系。
    此外，国营工业，国营商业和军需的加工订货，对于扶持手工业者合作化，也具有很大的作用。手工业生产合作社工作者要根据自身的可能条件努力争取做好，这些订货保证产品的规格、质量，努力降低成本。五
    对手工业者的社会主义改造，除了从经济上进行改造外，还要从思想上进行改造。这种改造比起经济上的改造，需要作更多工作和更长时间。因此，要大张旗鼓地向一切手工业者进行过渡时期总任务的宣传，进行社会主义前途的教育。
    由手工业生产到半机械化、机械化生产，没有技术的提高，是不可能的。为此，要做好尊师爱徒教育，订立师徒教学合同；组织技术研究会，采用师傅教徒弟，社员互教的群众路线的教学方法；组织先进者和落后者观摩互助；组织社员到国营工厂参观，请国营工厂工程师和工人到社内指导生产。
    为了学好政治和技术，必须特别注意文化学习。在生产合作社有一定发展的情况下，应考虑在中等技术学校或自设学校中，有计划的轮训在职干部和社员，以培养领导骨干和技术人材。
    典型示范，也是一种有效的教育方式。对手工业生产合作社的经验传播要适当，表扬优点、纠正缺点，表扬长处、纠正短处，才能避免片面性。要对生产者、对国家、对消费者三方面都要好，才叫做优越。手工业生产合作社的优越性，主要表现在劳动生产率高，产品质量好、数量大、成本低。为了证明手工业生产合作社生产比个体生产好，因此，对已组织起来的生产合作社，只许办好，不许办坏。目前尤其要把办好手工业生产合作社，作为我们工作的重点。
    为了对手工业者进行社会主义改造，需要了解手工业情况，作全国性手工业调查，但不要采取发表格的方式和各城、各县、各乡都搞。采取行业排队，典型摸底，但不要普查。把人数、生产的数量、质量、产销情况弄清。并对学徒的情况：需要多少，目前在增加还是在减少也摸摸底。
    明年的计划控制数字，已经作出，可以作为布置工作的依据。为了完成明年的计划，首先需要把现有的供销生产小组、供销生产合作社、生产合作社作几个典型的系统地全面地总结，以便首先作出提高现有生产合作组织的计划、步骤和方法。现有生产合作组织是系统地全面地改造手工业的结果，是我们今后发展的基础，必须珍惜几年来的经验。
    现在全国各地党委都比过去更多地重视了手工业的社会主义改造工作，并已在加强领导，加强力量，这就保证了这一工作的顺利进行。任务是繁重的光荣的，而工作条件是很有利的，让我们大家以百倍的信心，在各级党委的领导下，坚决地胜利地贯彻毛主席对手工业进行社会主义改造的指示。
