Since August, the weather in most areas of Jiangsu Province has been sunny. Farmers in various places are seizing the opportunity to dry their wheat and sell it to the state. Farmers in Qili Township, Jiangdu County, use doors, tables, reed mats, and all available tools to sun-dry their wheat on every sunny day. The daily amount of wheat entering the market in Songjiang, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Yancheng and other special districts has increased by one-half to one times compared to the daily amount at the end of July. The amount of wheat sold by farmers in the three special districts of Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and Nantong has exceeded the state's purchase plan by 5% to over 30%. Many farmers in these three special districts are continuing to sell their wheat.

    江苏省农民利用晴天时机
    把小麦晒干卖给国家
    八月份以来江苏省大部地区天气放晴，各地农民抓紧时机，把小麦晒干，卖给国家。江都县七里乡农民在每个晴天都用门板、桌子、芦席等一切可以晒麦的工具曝晒小麦。松江、苏州、镇江、扬州、盐城等专区每天上市的小麦比七月底每天上市量增加二分之一到一倍。徐州、淮阴、南通三个专区的农民出卖的小麦已超过国家收购计划百分之五到百分之三十以上。现在这三个专区还有许多农民在继续出卖小麦。
