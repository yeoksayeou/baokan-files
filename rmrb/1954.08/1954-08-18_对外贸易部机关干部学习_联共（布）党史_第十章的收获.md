The Study Room of the Directly Subordinate Organs Committee of the CCP Foreign Trade Ministry

The study of Chapter 10 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" by cadres of the organs of the Central People's Government Ministry of Foreign Trade began on April 19th, completing the study plan for the entire chapter and related documents in two and a half months. At the end of the study, in addition to a unified written test, theoretical instructors conducted oral examinations for a small number of comrades. Through the study of Chapter 10 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", the cadres have achieved the following main gains:

	I. They have a further understanding of the issue of focusing on the development of heavy industry. The vast majority of comrades, after studying the Party's general line during the transition period, have a preliminary understanding of the principle of socialist industrialization, but lack a comprehensive and systematic understanding of why the development of heavy industry is the central link of industrialization. Some comrades only believe that heavy industry is helpful for consolidating national defense and economic independence, and do not know its role in the socialist transformation of the national economy; others, although able to list the significance of developing heavy industry to all aspects as a conclusion, have vague concepts, repetitive levels, and chaotic logic when narrating. Through study, everyone not only understands that only by developing heavy industry can economic independence and national defense be guaranteed, but also can recognize the great significance of developing heavy industry from the relationship between the technological transformation of the national economy and the socialist transformation of the national economy, as well as the relationship between heavy industry and the technological transformation of the national economy. Moreover, this time the theory of industrialization was studied in conjunction with Soviet history, and everyone also gained some scientific knowledge (such as the role of various departments of heavy industry) from the lectures, so the understanding of the issues is more specific. Everyone reflected, "The impression is much deeper." Based on this understanding, some comrades' erroneous understanding left over from the general line study was resolved.

	II. They have a more comprehensive understanding of the process of socialist industrialization. In the past, some comrades simply understood industrialization as "internal affairs of industry", and viewed issues such as capital, grain, agricultural collectivization, five-year plans, and labor competitions in isolation, and "could not string them together with a red line." After studying Chapter 10 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and related documents, they realized that the above issues have a necessary connection with industrialization, and thus realized the arduousness and complexity of the industrialization cause, "It's really not simple." For example, the grain issue, in the past, many comrades regarded it as an "accidental phenomenon" or simply a "problem of supply falling short of demand". Now they understand that it is linked to socialist industrialization and recognize that it is "a problem that is inevitably encountered in the industrialization process of a small-peasant country", and it is a manifestation of the dispersed small-peasant economy failing to keep up with industrial development. In this way, a series of issues such as China's grain and certain non-staple food planned purchase and supply, and agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, have been raised to the level of industrialization, making everyone deeply feel that "all government measures are necessary and timely," and fundamentally resolving the "troublesome" thinking of a few comrades regarding grain planned supply. At the same time, because they saw that some problems China has encountered have also occurred in the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's road to industrialization is also the road China is to take, everyone particularly realized the practical significance of learning from Soviet experience from this study.

	III. They have a further understanding of the sharp and complex nature of class struggle during the transition period, and deepened their understanding of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session. After studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session, everyone began to pay attention to the sharp and complex situation of class struggle in China during the transition period, and the paralysis of thought was overcome to a certain extent. However, the general comrades' understanding is not yet deep or specific. Even some comrades still have some confused ideas. After this study, many comrades understood the intensification of class struggle in the Soviet Union at that time and the essence of the opposition's mistakes, gained a more specific understanding of the laws of class struggle during the transition period from the historical experience of the Soviet Union, thereby improving revolutionary vigilance and feeling that our current proposal to strengthen Party unity and unification and strengthen the Party's leading role is completely necessary and timely. They therefore deepened their understanding of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session. Some comrades also examined their confused ideas.

	IV. It promoted the increase in production and practicing economy, and laid the ideological foundation for continuing to carry out work competition. Because the study recognized that the issue of capital is a serious problem in the cause of industrialization, and increasing production and practicing economy is the fundamental method of accumulating capital, everyone strengthened their emphasis on increasing production and practicing economy, and strengthened the idea of working hard for industrialization. For example, a part of the comrades who were dissatisfied with living conditions changed their emotions after this study, seeing the situation of the Soviet Union's hard struggle for industrialization in those years. Also a small number of units linked to improving work, such as the business section of the Native Produce Export Company proposed to strive to expand exports; the finance and accounting section proposed careful calculation and accelerated capital turnover; the storage and transportation section proposed saving transportation costs and improving packaging guarantees; the price section also proposed specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy. This study also enabled everyone to systematically clarify the nature and role of socialist competition in theory, resolve thoughts such as "competition is not necessary", "competition affects the body", and "competition indicators have no end", criticize championism, recognize that "competition is not simply strengthening labor intensity, but is combined with giving play to the masses' wisdom to improve work", and recognize that "competition indicators always develop upwards according to needs and possibilities." In this way, everyone realized the correctness of the resolution of the First Party Congress of the Ministry on carrying out socialist work competition, and laid the ideological foundation for continuing to carry out competition.

From the above learning gains, the role of studying Chapter 10 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and related documents is significant. From the test results, generally speaking, they are all better, but there are also some shortcomings in the study of this chapter, which are reflected in:

	I. Many comrades focus on memorizing ready-made clauses and conclusions, but their understanding of the spirit of the documents is insufficient. For example, some comrades can recite: "To realize socialist transformation, the primary thing is to realize technological transformation," and "The socialist economic form is compatible with advanced large-scale production," but they cannot explain its meaning.

	II. Some comrades still cannot explain the problem from the specific situation of the Soviet Union. For example, some cannot answer: "Under what circumstances was the Soviet industrialization policy put forward?" Some answered the Soviet Union's problems at that time according to China's general task during the transition period, such as saying: "Transforming capitalist ownership into public ownership is through processing, ordering, and joint ventures," etc.

The reason why these shortcomings arise, in addition to the lower level of some students and the low quality of teaching, is that many comrades had a sense of complacency after studying the general line, thinking that "there is nothing to learn in Chapter 10 of 'History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'", so not seriously reading the documents and working hard to study is also an important reason.

From the teaching of Chapter 10, we have the following experiences:

	I. After studying the Party's general line during the transition period, when studying Chapter 10 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", special attention should be paid to overcoming complacency and strengthening ideological leadership. Although studying the general line is a favorable condition for studying Chapter 10 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", many comrades have some complacency and do not seriously study the documents. Although they can say a few words when discussing, most of them stay on the surface, and the test papers also show that they have not learned thoroughly. Although we have discovered this complacency early and criticized it in a circular, and most branches have also criticized it, because we did not pay enough attention and did not actively study specific methods to overcome it, the ideological leadership work of most branches was poorly done, and it only stayed on general appeals, lacking convincing power. Therefore, strengthening ideological leadership is an important link in doing a good job in learning, and this work must be carried out meticulously and deeply.

	II. After studying the general line, because the cadres have a general understanding of the content of socialist industrialization, the lectures must be focused, combined with the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism for analysis, and pay attention to explaining the theoretical principles from the historical development of Soviet economic construction. The so-called focus of the explanation, such as when explaining the issue of developing heavy industry, focuses on explaining the relationship between socialist transformation and technological transformation, as well as the relationship between heavy industry and technological transformation. When talking about the issue of funds, the focus is on explaining the significance of increasing production and practicing economy for accumulating funds. For general problems that are already familiar (such as the significance of developing heavy industry for consolidating national defense and economic independence, the path of capital accumulation, and the source of capital accumulation in socialist countries, etc.), there is no need for much analysis. This can not only save time and avoid distracting students, but also concentrate time to go deeper into key issues and play a guiding role in research. Lectures should be combined with the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, such as when explaining the relationship between socialist transformation and technological transformation, the concepts of productive forces and relations of production, and the relationship between them must be explained. By doing so, the comrades reflected that it was "very enlightening" and could help to deeply understand the problem. In addition, attention should be paid to introducing the specific historical situation of the Soviet Union at that time, and do not explain the theoretical principles in isolation from the historical development of Soviet economic construction, which is not in line with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. Especially since the general cadres do not know much about the historical situation of the Soviet Union at that time, they often raise questions from hypothetical situations in the study, which requires guiding them to study theoretical problems in combination with the specific historical process of the Soviet Union's construction of a socialist society.

    对外贸易部机关干部学习“联共（布）党史”第十章的收获
    中共对外贸易部直属机关委员会学习室
    中央人民政府对外贸易部机关干部对“联共（布）党史”第十章的学习，从四月十九日开始，以两个半月的时间完成了全章和有关文件的学习计划。学习结束时，除进行了统一的笔试外，理论教员对少数同志进行了口试。干部们通过“联共（布）党史”第十章的学习，有以下几项主要的收获：
    一、对于着重发展重工业的问题有了进一步的认识。绝大多数同志经过党在过渡时期的总路线的学习，对社会主义工业化的道理已有初步的了解，但对为什么发展重工业是工业化的中心环节，缺乏全面、系统的认识。有的同志只认为重工业对巩固国防和经济独立有帮助，而不知道它对国民经济社会主义改造的作用；也有的同志虽然能结论式地列举发展重工业对各方面的意义，但叙述时概念模糊，层次重复，逻辑混乱。经过学习，大家不仅能了解到只有发展重工业，才能保证经济独立和国防巩固，而且能从国民经济技术改造对国民经济社会主义改造的关系以及重工业对国民经济技术改造的关系上来认识发展重工业的重大意义。而且，这一次是结合苏联历史来学习工业化的理论的，大家又从听课中获得了一些科学常识（如重工业各部门的作用），因而对问题的认识比较具体了。大家反映说：“印象深刻多了。”在这个认识的基础上，解决了一些同志在总路线学习中遗留下来的错误认识。
    二、对社会主义工业化的过程有了较全面的认识。过去有些同志把工业化单纯理解为“工业内部的事”，把资金、粮食、农业集体化、五年计划、劳动竞赛等问题孤立地看，而“不能拿一条红线把它们串起来”。学习了“联共（布）党史”第十章和有关文件，才了解上述问题和工业化有必然的联系，从而认识到工业化事业的艰苦复杂，“真不简单”。例如粮食问题，过去有不少同志看作是“偶然现象”，或单纯是“供不应求问题”，现在懂得把它和社会主义工业化联在一起了，认识到这是“在小农国家工业化过程中必然遇到的问题”，是分散的小农经济赶不上工业发展的表现。这样，就把我国粮食，某些副食品计划购销，农业互助合作等一系列问题都提高到工业化的问题上来认识，使大家深深感到“政府的一切措施既必须，又适时”，并从根本上解决了少数同志对粮食计划供应“嫌麻烦”的思想。同时，由于看到我国已遇到的若干问题苏联都发生过，苏联工业化的道路也正是我国要走的道路，所以大家从这一学习中特别体会到学习苏联经验的现实意义。
    三、对过渡时期阶级斗争尖锐复杂的性质有了进一步的认识，加深了对四中全会决议的领会。经过四中全会文件的学习，大家对我国过渡时期阶级斗争尖锐复杂的状况已开始注意，麻痹思想有了一定程度的克服。但一般同志认识还不深刻，不具体。甚至某些同志仍存在着一些糊涂思想。经过了这一学习，许多同志了解了苏联当时城乡阶级斗争的尖锐化以及反对派错误的实质，从苏联的历史经验中对过渡时期阶级斗争的规律有了更具体的认识，从而提高了革命警惕性，感到我们目前提出增强党的团结和统一、加强党的领导作用是完全必要的和适时的。他们因此也加深了对四中全会决议的领会。某些同志并检查了自己的糊涂思想。
    四、推动了增产节约，并为继续开展工作竞赛打下了思想基础。由于在学习中认识到资金问题是工业化事业中的严重问题，而增产节约则是积累资金的根本方法，因此大家加强了对增产节约的重视，加强了为工业化而艰苦奋斗的思想。如有一部分对生活条件不满的同志，经过了这一学习，看到苏联当年为工业化而艰苦奋斗的情况，情绪就有所改变。也有少数单位联系到改进工作，如土产出口公司业务科提出努力扩大出口；财会科提出精打细算，加速资金周转；储运科提出节省运转费用、改进包装等保证；物价科并提出增产节约的具体计划。这一学习并使大家从理论上系统地弄清了社会主义竞赛的性质和作用，解决了“竞赛没有必要”、“竞赛影响身体”、“竞赛指标没有终止”等思想，批判了锦标主义，认识到“竞赛不是单纯加强劳动强度，而是和发挥群众智慧改进工作相结合的”，认识到“竞赛指标永远根据需要和可能向上发展”。这样就使大家体会到本部第一届党代表大会关于开展社会主义工作竞赛的决议的正确，为继续开展竞赛打下了思想基础。
    从以上学习收获看，学习“联共（布）党史”第十章和有关文件的作用是显著的。从考试成绩看，一般地说都较好，但这一章的学习也存在着一些缺点，这表现在：
    一、不少同志偏重于现成条文、结论的记诵，但对文件的精神理解不够。如有的同志虽然能背出：“要实现社会主义改造，首要的事情是要实现技术改造”，“社会主义的经济形式是和先进大生产相适应的”，但对它的含义却说不出。
    二、部分同志还不能从苏联具体情况出发来说明问题。如有的就答不出：“苏联工业化方针是在什么情况下提出的”？有的却按我国过渡时期的总任务来回答苏联当时的问题，如说：“把资本主义所有制改造成为全民所有制，是经过加工、订货、合营”等。
    这些缺点所以产生，除因某些学员水平较低、教学质量不高外，不少同志在总路线学习后存在着自满情绪，认为“联共（布）党史”第十章“没有什么可学了”，因而不去认真阅读文件和刻苦钻研也是重要的原因。
    从第十章的教学中，我们有以下几点体会：
    一、在学过党在过渡时期的总路线之后，再学“联共（布）党史”第十章，应特别注意克服自满情绪，加强思想领导。学过总路线，虽然对学习“联共（布）党史”第十章是一个有利条件，但是不少的同志有某些自满情绪，他们不认真钻研文件。在讨论时发言虽能说上几句，但多半停留在表面上，从考试答卷情况也看出学的不透。我们虽早经发现这种自满情绪，并曾通报批判，多数支部也进行过批判，但由于我们重视不够，也没有积极研究具体办法来加以克服，以致大多数支部的思想领导工作做得较差，也仅是停留在一般的号召上，缺乏令人信服的力量。所以，加强思想领导是搞好学习的重要环节，这个工作必须细致深入地进行。
    二、在学过总路线之后，由于干部们对社会主义工业化的内容有了一般的理解，因此，讲课必须有重点，结合马克思列宁主义基本理论进行分析，并注意从苏联经济建设的历史发展中来讲解理论原理。所谓重点讲解，如在讲发展重工业问题时，就着重讲社会主义改造与技术改造的关系以及重工业与技术改造的关系。讲资金问题着重讲增产节约对积累资金的意义。对一般已熟悉的问题（如发展重工业对巩固国防与经济独立的意义，资金积累的道路和社会主义国家资金积累的源泉等），就不须多加分析。这不仅可以节省时间，避免学员情绪分散，还能集中时间把重点问题深入一步，起引导钻研的作用。讲课要结合马克思列宁主义的基本原理，如讲社会主义改造与技术改造的关系，就必须把生产力、生产关系的概念，它们间的关系讲一下。这样做了，同志们反映“很有启发性”，且能帮助深入领会问题。此外，要注意介绍苏联当时具体的历史情况，不要脱离苏联经济建设的历史的发展孤立地讲解理论原理，那样做是和马克思列宁主义精神不符合的。特别是由于一般干部对苏联当时历史情况很不了解，在学习中经常从假设的情况提出问题，这更需要引导他们结合苏联建设社会主义社会的具体历史过程来研究理论问题。
