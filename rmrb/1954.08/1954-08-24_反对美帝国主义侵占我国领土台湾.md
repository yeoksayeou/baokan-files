Oppose American Imperialism's Occupation of Our Territory, Taiwan
Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs

Taiwan is an area of our country that has not yet been liberated. While hundreds of millions of people on the mainland have joyfully spent five free and happy years and are marching towards a socialist society, the compatriots in Taiwan are still groaning in the dire straits of the double oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and American imperialism. This is an absolutely intolerable phenomenon. The joint declaration of all democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China for the liberation of Taiwan solemnly declared to the world: "Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan." This is the unshakable common will of all 600 million Chinese people.

The American imperialists are unwilling to see China's national unification and the liberation of the Chinese people; they have tried every possible means to obstruct and sabotage our people's cause of liberation. During the mainland liberation war, the American ruling group used 6 billion US dollars worth of military supplies to support Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime; after Chiang Kai-shek was driven out of mainland China by the Chinese people, the American ruling group was unwilling to admit defeat, and openly sent troops to forcibly occupy our Taiwan, sheltering Chiang Kai-shek's remnants, preventing us from liberating Taiwan, and interfering in our internal affairs. Like a rogue gambler, the American ruling group, after losing its 6 billion US dollar stake, still did not repent, but instead intensified its efforts to bet more on Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandit gang, the enemy of the Chinese people. For several years, it has desperately stepped up the arming of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, constantly supplying airplanes and warships, and turning Taiwan into an American base of aggression. The American ruling group vainly attempts to use this method to subvert the Chinese people's regime, so that Chiang Kai-shek's rule can be revived on the mainland, thereby enabling the United States to turn the entire China into an American colony.

The American ruling group's aggressive intentions to be hostile to the Chinese people are blatant and outspoken. Walter Robertson, the US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, openly admitted on January 26 this year in the Appropriations Committee of the US House of Representatives that the US policy is to "maintain a constant threat to Red China led by Taiwan and other Far Eastern groups and supported by the US military." He admitted that the essence of US policy is "to maintain American dominance in the Far East indefinitely." As early as 1952, the war-monger Radford, the current Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the US Congress: "Red China must be destroyed, even if it must fight a fifty-year war on the Asian continent." The actions of the American ruling group over the past few years have fully confirmed that this is the official policy of the US government. The Korean War launched by the United States and the American intervention in Indochina both contain the clear intention of encircling and invading China.

After the armistice was achieved in Korea and Indochina, Taiwan became the main base for the American ruling group to launch aggression against China, and also the main tool for the American ruling group to create tension, prevent the restoration of peace in Asia, and prepare for a third world war. On the one hand, the American ruling group stepped up military "aid" to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, sending "Military Assistance Advisory Groups" to reorganize Chiang's defeated troops, and on the other hand, planned to conclude a so-called "bilateral common security treaty" with Chiang, in order to drive Chiang to attack the Chinese mainland and prolong the American occupation of Taiwan. In addition, the American ruling group is piecing together a so-called "Northeast Asia Defense Alliance" composed of the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs, plus Japanese reactionary forces, with the spearhead pointing at China. Recently, American reactionary soldiers such as Van Fleet, secret service chiefs such as Donovan, and large and small naval and air force generals have flocked to Taiwan like flies to carrion. All this shows that the American ruling group's aggressive activities in Taiwan have reached an extremely rampant stage.

It should be pointed out that although the American ruling group's aggression activities centered on Taiwan are mainly aimed at China, they are not limited to China. MacArthur, the former commander-in-chief of the US invading army in Korea, said very clearly: the United States, from the chain of Pacific islands centered on Taiwan, can use its air force to control every Asian port from Vladivostok to Singapore. This means that in addition to wanting to invade China, the United States also wants to invade other Asian countries. In fact, the United States has already used Taiwan as a base to send naval and air forces to cooperate with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out pirate-style interceptions of ships of various countries sailing on the high seas. This directly infringes upon the legitimate interests of the people of all countries. Under the drive of the United States, Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandits harass our coastal areas, creating tension in this area, and indirectly threatening the people of other countries. The people of all countries in the world have just breathed a sigh of relief because the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the Indochina armistice issue, and they are extremely angry at the attempt of the American imperialists to create tension in the Far East.

Therefore, whether for the benefit of the Chinese people or for the benefit of world peace, it is intolerable for Taiwan to continue to be occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and occupied by the United States. Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai announced at the meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on August 11: "Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory, and will never allow the United States to occupy it, nor will it allow it to be handed over to the United Nations for trusteeship. The liberation of Taiwan is China's sovereignty and internal affairs, and no other country is allowed to interfere. Any treaty concluded by the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique entrenched in Taiwan is illegal and invalid." This fully demonstrates the solemn position of the Chinese government and people on the Taiwan issue.

The Chinese people, who have been tempered by long-term revolutionary struggles, have a clear understanding of the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism, and are able to give a strong rebuff to the provocations and acts of aggression of imperialism. The Chinese people love peace: they do not invade others, nor do they interfere in the internal affairs of other countries; but they also do not allow others to invade us or interfere in our internal affairs. Anyone who mistakes the Chinese people's love of peace and efforts to strive for peace as a sign of weakness is greatly mistaken. We fully support the solemn warning put forward in the joint declaration of all democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China for the liberation of Taiwan: "Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is an exercise of China's sovereignty and China's internal affairs, and no foreign country is allowed to interfere. If foreign aggressors dare to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, that is to interfere in China's internal affairs, infringe upon China's sovereignty, and undermine China's territorial integrity, and they must bear all the serious consequences of this act of aggression."

Taiwan must be liberated. Only when Taiwan is liberated can the unification of the Chinese nation be completed; and only when Taiwan is liberated can the serious threat of American imperialism to the security of the Asian people be reduced, and peace in the Far East and the world can be further consolidated. The liberation of Taiwan is not only an act of China's sovereignty, but also a just action to defend and strengthen world peace supported by the people of the world. The Chinese people are determined to fight to the end for the sacred task of liberating Taiwan.

    反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾
    中国人民外交学会会长　张奚若
    台湾是我国现在还没有解放的地区。在大陆上亿万人民已欢乐地度过五个自由快乐的年头并正向社会主义社会迈进的时候，台湾的同胞们还呻吟在蒋介石卖国集团和美帝国主义双重压迫的水深火热的苦难之中，这是一种绝对不能容忍的现象。中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言庄严地向全世界宣告：“台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。”这是全中国六万万人民的不可动摇的共同意志。
    美帝国主义者是不愿意看见中国全国统一和中国人民得到解放的；它曾千方百计地阻挠和破坏我国人民的解放事业。在大陆解放战争期间，美国统治集团曾经用了六十亿美元的军事物资来支持蒋介石的反动政权；在蒋介石被中国人民赶出中国大陆之后，美国统治集团不甘失败，公然出兵强占我国台湾，庇护蒋介石残匪，阻止我解放台湾，干涉我国内政。就像一个无赖的赌徒一样，美国统治集团在六十亿美元的赌本输光之后，依然不知悔改，反而变本加厉地对中国人民公敌蒋介石残余匪帮投下更多的赌注。几年以来它拼命加紧武装蒋介石卖国集团，不断供给飞机军舰，并把台湾变成美国的侵略基地。美国统治集团妄想用这种方法来颠覆中国人民政权，使蒋介石统治在大陆死灰复燃，从而使美国能够把整个中国变成美国的殖民地。
    美国统治集团与中国人民为敌的侵略意图是明目张胆、直言不讳的。美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊今年一月二十六日在美国众议院拨款委员会中曾公开承认美国的政策是“保持由台湾和其他远东集团带头并在美国军事支持下对红色中国进行经常威胁”。他承认美国政策的实质是“要在远东无限期地保持美国的支配地位”。远在一九五二年，现任美国参谋长联席会议主席的战争贩子雷德福便曾告诉美国国会说：“红色中国必须毁灭，即使必须在亚洲大陆打五十年战争也必须这样做。”过去几年中，美国统治集团的行动完全证实了这就是美国政府的官方政策。美国发动的侵朝战争和美国对印度支那的干涉活动，都包含着包围中国、侵略中国的明显意图。
    朝鲜及印度支那实现了停战以后，台湾便成了美国统治集团对中国发动侵略的主要基地，也是美国统治集团制造紧张局势、阻止亚洲恢复和平、准备第三次世界大战的主要工具。美国统治集团一方面加紧对蒋介石卖国集团的军事“援助”，派遣
  “军事援助顾问团”替蒋匪整编他的残兵败将，一方面策划和蒋匪订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”，以便驱使蒋匪向中国大陆进攻，并使美国对台湾的占领长期化。此外，美国统治集团还在拼凑一个由蒋介石、李承晚匪帮加上日本反动势力组成的矛头指向中国的所谓“东北亚防御联盟”。最近，美国反动军人如范佛里特、特务头子如杜诺万以及大大小小的海空军将领如蝇趋膻地纷纷到台湾去。这一切都表示美国统治集团在台湾的侵略活动已经到达了十分嚣张的阶段。
    应该指出：美国统治集团以台湾为中心的侵略活动，虽然是以中国为主要对象，但并不限于中国。美国前侵朝军总司令麦克阿瑟说得很清楚：美国从以台湾为中心环节的太平洋岛屿锁链，就可以用空军控制从海参崴到新加坡的每一个亚洲港口。这就是说，美国除想侵略中国之外，还想侵略亚洲其他国家。事实上，美国已经利用台湾为基地出动海空军协同蒋介石卖国集团对各国航行在公海上的船只进行海盗式的拦劫。这就直接侵犯了各国人民的合法利益。蒋介石残匪在美国驱使之下骚扰我国沿海地区，造成这一地区的紧张局势，间接也使别国人民受到威胁。世界各国人民刚刚因为日内瓦会议在印度支那停战问题上获得了协议而松了一口气，对于美帝国主义者在远东制造紧张局势的企图是感到极端愤怒的。
    因此，无论为了中国人民的利益，或是为了世界和平的利益，台湾继续为蒋介石卖国集团所盘据，并为美国所占领，都是不可容忍的。周恩来总理兼外长八月十一日在中央人民政府委员会会议上宣布：“台湾是中国神圣不可侵犯的领土，决不容许美国侵占，也决不容许交给联合国托管。解放台湾是中国的主权和内政，决不容许他国干涉。美国政府和盘据台湾的蒋介石卖国集团无论订立什么条约都是非法的，无效的。”这充分表明了中国政府和人民对台湾问题的严正立场。
    中国人民久经革命斗争的锻炼，对于帝国主义的阴谋诡计看得很清楚，对于帝国主义的挑衅和侵略行为是能够给以有力的回击的。中国人民是爱好和平的：不侵犯别人，不干涉别国内政；但也不容许别人侵犯我们或干涉我们的内政。谁要是把中国人民热爱和平、争取和平的努力误认为是软弱的表示，那就大错特错了。我们完全拥护中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言中提出的严正警告：“解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，是行使中国的主权，是中国的内政，决不容许任何外国干涉。如果外国侵略者敢于阻挠中国人民解放台湾，那就是干涉中国的内政，侵犯中国的主权，破坏中国的领土完整，他们就必须承担这一侵略行为的一切严重后果。”
    台湾必须解放。只有台湾获得了解放，中国国家的统一才算完成；也只有台湾获得了解放，美帝国主义对亚洲人民安全的严重威胁才能减轻，远东和世界和平才能进一步获得巩固。解放台湾不但是中国的主权行动，而且也是全世界人民所支持的保卫和加强世界和平的正义行动。中国人民决心为解放台湾这个神圣任务奋斗到底。
