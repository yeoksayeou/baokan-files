Guangdong's marine fishing season is approaching. Fishermen along the coast are generally repairing boats, mending nets, and adding production tools early in order to meet the needs of the autumn fishing season. At present, Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company, trading companies, and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are vigorously organizing fishing supplies to meet the growing needs of fishermen along the coast. The Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company began organizing supplies for the autumn fishing season in April this year. Up to now, the company has purchased mats, jute, wood, and other major fishing supplies worth 18.5 billion yuan from various places, an increase of 42 percent over the same period last year. In order to solve the production difficulties of some fishermen, fishery loans in various places have been issued earlier than in previous years. Pre-purchase of fish catches has been implemented in seven major fishing areas along the coast, such as Zhabo and Shanwei, and more than 2.5 billion yuan in pre-purchase deposits have been issued, which has greatly encouraged the fishermen's production enthusiasm and ensured that they can carry out boat repair and net mending work and add production tools in advance. At the same time, in order to develop deep-sea operations and support the development of the fishery mutual aid and cooperation movement, the state has built four local state-owned shipyards in Guangdong Province this year, preparing to manufacture 97 deep-sea sailing fishing boats and 16 shallow-water fishing boats, which will be loaned to organized fishermen. It is estimated that this batch of fishing boats can increase fish production by 2,400 tons after they are built. At present, except for the Hainan Shipyard, which is still under construction, the others have been completed and put into production around mid-July. They are currently seizing the time to build ships in order to welcome the arrival of the autumn fishing season. Due to the development of production and the increase in market demand, the task of purchasing fish products this autumn fishing season will be doubled compared with the same period last year; the fish products that need to be processed will be increased by 1.5 times compared with last year. Therefore, in addition to giving full play to the capacity of existing processing equipment, the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company has also invested 15.1 billion yuan to increase some processing, storage, and transportation equipment accordingly. At the same time, in order to gradually develop fresh sales business and ensure the people's demand for fresh fish, the company has invested 3.5 billion yuan to establish one ice factory, two cold storage warehouses (with power equipment), and fourteen ice storage warehouses (without power equipment) in the main coastal fishing areas. At present, these basic construction projects are being actively built, and efforts are being made to complete them all before the autumn fishing season. (Our Guangdong reporter station)

    广东省沿海渔区积极准备迎接秋汛旺季
    广东海洋渔汛旺季即将到来，沿海渔民普遍提早修船补网和添置生产工具，以迎接秋汛大生产。现在，广东省水产供销公司、贸易公司和各地的供销合作社正大力组织渔民用品，供应沿海渔民生产上日益增长的需要。广东省水产供销公司于今年四月间就开始组织秋汛时的供应工作，到目前止该公司已从各地采购席子、黄麻、木材等主要渔民用品价值一百八十五亿元，比去年同期增加百分之四十二。为解决部分渔民生产困难，各地渔业贷款都比往年提前发放。在闸波、汕尾等沿海七个主要渔区实行鱼货预购工作，发放预购定金已达二十五亿元以上，因而大大鼓舞了渔民的生产情绪，并保证了他们能够提前进行修船补网工作和添补生产工具。同时为了发展深水作业和支持渔业互助合作运动的开展，国家今年在广东省兴建了四个地方国营造船厂，准备制造深水风帆渔船九十七条、浅水渔船十六条，贷放给已组织起来的渔民。这批渔船造出后，估计可增产鱼货二千四百吨。现在除海南造船厂仍在积极兴建中外，其他都已在七月中旬前后竣工并投入生产，目前正抓紧造船，以迎接秋汛的到来。由于生产的发展和市场需要的增大，今年秋汛鱼产的收购任务将较去年同期增加一倍；需要进行加工的鱼货则将比去年增加一倍半。因此广东省水产供销公司除充分发挥现有加工设备的能力外，并已投资一百五十一亿元，相适应地增加一部分加工、库储及运输的设备。同时为逐步发展鲜销业务，保证人民对鱼类鲜食的需求，该公司已投资三十五亿元，在沿海的主要渔区建立冰厂一个，冷藏库（有动力设备）二个，冰库（无动力设备）十四个。现在这些基本建设工程正积极兴建，争取在秋汛前全部竣工。（本报广东记者站）
