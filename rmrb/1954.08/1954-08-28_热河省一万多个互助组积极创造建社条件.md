	Over 13,500 mutual aid teams in Rehe Province are actively creating conditions for establishing agricultural production cooperatives, preparing to establish them after the autumn harvest. In Sandao Ying Village, Longhua County, Zhang Baogui and two other mutual aid teams hoed their sorghum and millet three times this year and pressed over 9 million jin of green manure, preparing to apply 8,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu after the cooperatives are established. Some teams have initially adopted collective management methods during summer hoeing, and some have implemented a small group rotation system. The team members have high morale, so few teams disbanded during the summer hoeing. In the 12th District of Chifeng County, 42 new mutual aid teams were also established during the summer hoeing. Some teams have also accumulated some public property for the establishment of cooperatives. In the suburban area of Chengde City, 31 groups jointly planted more than 11,300 fruit trees, and 8 groups jointly reclaimed more than 400 mu of river wasteland and planted rice. Additionally, 51 groups jointly purchased 57 draught animals, and 11 groups jointly purchased 11 waterwheels and sprayers. Many mutual aid teams are actively studying relevant documents on establishing cooperatives to make ideological preparations for establishing cooperatives. In Kuli Village, Wudan County, 16 teams merged to form three large teams in preparation for establishing cooperatives after the autumn harvest and led all team members to study the cooperative's charter. Some teams have already sent their prepared accountants to the accounting groups of nearby agricultural production cooperatives to learn business skills.

    热河省一万多个互助组积极创造建社条件
    热河省有一万三千五百多个互助组在积极创造建社条件，准备秋后建立农业生产合作社。隆化县三道营村张宝贵等三个互助组今年的高粱、谷子全部锄了三遍，并压了九百多万斤绿肥，准备建社后每亩施八千斤底肥；有些组在夏锄中初步采取了集体经营方法，有的实行了小组轮作制，组员生产情绪很高，所以今年夏锄中很少有散伙的，赤峰县十二区在夏锄中还新建立了四十二个互助组；有的组还为建社积累了一些公共财产，承德市郊区有三十一个组合伙栽了一万一千三百多棵果树，八个组合伙开垦了四百多亩河荒，并种了水稻，还有五十一个组伙买了五十七头耕畜，十一个组伙买了十一台水车、喷雾器等；很多互助组积极学习有关建社文件，为建社做好思想准备工作。乌丹县苦力村有十六个组为了秋后建社，合并成立了三个大组，并领导全体组员学习了社章，有的组已把准备好的会计，送到附近农业生产合作社的会计小组学习业务。
