Welcoming the New Development of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
Eleven Provinces Including Liaoning and Henan are Making Preparations

Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Rehe, Shaanxi, Hubei, Henan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Fujian, and Shandong provinces are actively carrying out various preparations to welcome the new development of agricultural producers' cooperatives. Currently, many mutual aid teams in various regions have signed up to apply for establishing cooperatives. According to a survey of thirty-six counties in Heilongjiang Province, more than 14,400 mutual aid teams have registered with local CCP district committees or village branches to request the establishment of cooperatives. In Keshan County, the mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives after the autumn harvest have organized 275 committees to create conditions for establishing cooperatives. In Rehe Province, more than 13,500 mutual aid teams that have registered to establish cooperatives after the autumn harvest are actively carrying out various preparations for establishing cooperatives. In Shaanxi Province, more than 30,000 mutual aid team members are preparing to establish agricultural producers' cooperatives around the time of the autumn harvest. Since the summer hoeing season in Hubei Province, many year-round mutual aid teams have applied to establish cooperatives; in the Xiaogan Special District and Xishui County alone, more than 10,000 year-round mutual aid teams have requested to establish cooperatives.

The leading organs of various provinces have formulated plans for developing agricultural producers' cooperatives based on local conditions and are carrying out work such as training cadres for establishing cooperatives. Shandong Province will establish 60,000 new cooperatives after the autumn harvest. In the three regions of Liaocheng, Dezhou, and Jining alone, 36,000 key personnel for establishing cooperatives are planned to be trained before and after the autumn harvest. From the autumn harvest to next spring in Henan Province, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province will increase from the existing 5,600-plus to 50,000. At that time, about 70 percent of the province's villages will have cooperatives. The counties in Xinxiang and Nanyang Special Districts are using production gaps to train more than 14,000 key members of mutual aid teams. For the first batch of 1,235 cooperatives planned to be established in Xinxiang Special District, 1,039 cadres have been selected and assigned. The Xinxiang Local Committee of the CCP has also dispatched cadres to conduct in-depth investigations and summarize the specific experiences of establishing cooperatives in mountainous, plain, waterlogged, and sandy areas throughout the special district last winter and this spring. Yunnan Province will develop 5,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives this autumn and next spring, and the province has decided to train 30,000 key personnel for establishing cooperatives at the provincial, special district, and county levels. The three special districts of Qujing, Dali, and Mengzi, and more than 50 counties including Zhaotong and Malong, have convened mutual aid and cooperation representative conferences, symposiums, or agricultural producers' cooperative cadre meetings to train cadres and summarize the experience of establishing cooperatives and production experience. Jilin Province has determined to build more than 15,000 new agricultural producers' cooperatives from summer hoeing to the Spring Festival, and to expand and consolidate the old cooperatives, driving the development and improvement of mutual aid teams.

Some provinces have already newly established a batch of agricultural producers' cooperatives or are conducting pilot work for establishing cooperatives. The work of establishing cooperatives before autumn in Sichuan Province has basically ended. The total number of cooperatives established before autumn has reached more than 7,600, which is more than twelve times the original number of cooperatives. In Suining Special District, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives accounts for 3 percent of the total number of peasant households, basically achieving the goal of having cooperatives in every village. In Hedong Township of Suining County, Shehong Township of Jianyang County, and Xipu Township of Pi County, which have a better working foundation, there are now cooperatives in every village. In Jilin Province, more than 800 agricultural producers' cooperatives were newly established during the summer hoeing period. According to an understanding of 420 new cooperatives, most of the new cooperatives have implemented the work-point system and reasonable crop rotation, and have hoed one more time than ordinary mutual aid teams, and the crops are growing particularly well. Now that it has entered the weeding season, many new cooperatives have begun to collectively accumulate fertilizer, repair embankments for flood control, and remove large weeds from the fields. The counties in Rehe Province are closely integrating the agricultural activities during the weeding season and successively unfolding pilot work for establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives. The earlier starting counties of Chifeng and Beipiao have established more than 700 new cooperatives, and the pilot work has been completed. It is expected that by the end of August, the work of establishing cooperatives throughout the province will be fully launched. The counties and districts in the eastern region of Liaoning Province conducted pilot projects for establishing cooperatives in late July and early August, and nearly one hundred cooperatives have now been established; the eastern region, except for some counties with flood control tasks, will also begin establishing cooperatives in the near future.

The original agricultural producers' cooperatives in various provinces are actively leading the peasant masses to take the path of collectivization. In the Nanping Special District of Fujian Province, the 325 agricultural producers' cooperatives generally have three or four mutual aid teams and some individual farmers united around them, actively creating conditions and preparing to establish cooperatives and teams after the autumn harvest. Each cooperative demonstrates to the surrounding farmers by its own consolidation, unity, increased production, and increased income, and adopts many methods to drive the surrounding mutual aid teams and individual farmers. For example, establishing regular meetings to exchange and disseminate experiences; the cooperatives and teams sign contracts to mutually adjust labor; the cooperatives take the initiative to unite the surrounding mutual aid teams and individual farmers to jointly carry out water conservancy and farmland capital construction. In addition, each cooperative pays attention to providing material and spiritual assistance to some farmers in difficulty at any time. The enthusiasm of each cooperative in helping the surrounding rural areas has greatly increased the prestige of agricultural producers' cooperatives among the peasant masses, and many farmers regard agricultural producers' cooperatives as their socialist school. The original six hundred-plus agricultural producers' cooperatives in Sichuan Province helped nearby mutual aid teams that already met the conditions to establish cooperatives. Members of mutual aid teams who visited agricultural producers' cooperatives were warmly received. Since the spring plowing in Neijiang Special District, a total of 160,000 people have visited the cooperatives.

    迎接农业生产合作社的新发展
    辽宁河南等十一省进行准备工作
    辽宁、黑龙江、吉林、热河、陕西、湖北、河南、四川、云南、福建、山东十一省积极进行各项准备，迎接农业生产合作社的新发展。目前，各地都有许多互助组报名申请建社。黑龙江省据三十六个县的调查，已有一万四千四百多个互助组向当地中共区委员会或村支部报名要求建社。克山县准备秋后建社的互助组，已组织了二百七十五个创造建社条件委员会。热河省一万三千五百多个报名秋后建社的互助组，正积极进行各种建社准备工作。陕西省有三万多户互助组组员，准备在秋收前后建立农业生产合作社。湖北省自夏锄以来，很多常年互助组申请办社，仅孝感专区和浠水县要求办社的常年互助组就有一万个以上。
    各省领导机关根据当地具体情况，已制定出发展农业生产合作社计划，并进行着训练建社干部等工作。山东省秋后将建立六万个新社。仅聊城、德州、济宁三个地区，就准备在秋收前后训练三万六千名办社骨干。河南省从秋后到明春，全省农业生产合作社将在现有的五千六百多个的基础上发展到五万个，那时全省约百分之七十左右的乡将乡乡有社。新乡专区和南阳专区各县利用生产空隙，现已训练互助组骨干分子一万四千多人。新乡专区第一批计划建立的一千二百三十五个社，已抽调配备干部一千零三十九人。中共新乡地方委员会还抽派干部深入调查和总结了去冬今春全专区山地、平原、水地、沙区建社的具体经验。云南省今秋明春将发展五千个农业生产合作社，全省决定分省、专区、县共训练办社骨干三万人。曲靖、大理、蒙自三个专区和昭通、马龙等五十多个县，已召开互助合作代表会、座谈会或农业生产合作社干部会议，训练干部，总结办社经验和生产经验。吉林省确定从夏锄到春节间新建一万五千多个农业生产合作社，并要扩大和巩固老社，带动互助组发展和提高。
    有些省已新建成一批农业生产合作社，或进行着建社试点工作。四川省秋前建社工作已基本结束。秋前建社总数达七千六百多个，为原有社数的十二倍多。遂宁专区入社的农户已占农户总数百分之三，基本上做到乡乡有社。工作基础较好的遂宁县河东乡、简阳县射洪乡、郫县犀浦乡，现在是村村有社了。吉林省在夏锄期间新建成八百多个农业生产合作社。据在四百二十个新社中了解，多数新社实行了包工制和合理轮作，并且比一般互助组多铲?一遍，庄稼也长得特别好。现已进入挂锄时期，许多新社开始集体积肥、修堤防汛和拔除田间大草。热河省各县密切结合挂锄期间的农事活动，相继展开建立农业生产合作社的试点工作。开始较早的赤峰、北票等七县已建成七百多个新社，试点工作已经完成。预计到八月下旬，全省的建社工作将全面展开。辽宁省东部地区各县、区在七月末八月初作了建社试点，现已建社近百个；东部地区除部分有防汛任务的县外，也将在最近开始建社。
    各省原有的农业生产合作社，积极带动着农民群众走合作化的道路。福建省南平专区的三百二十五个农业生产合作社，目前各个社一般都有三、四个互助组和一些单干农民团结在它们周围，积极创造条件，准备秋后办社、办组。各社以本身的巩固团结和增加生产、增加收入来向周围农民示范，并采取许多办法带动周围互助组和单干农民。如建立定期的碰头会来交流和传播经验；社和组订立互相调济劳动力合同；社主动团结周围互助组、单干农民共同进行兴修水利、农田基本建设。此外，各社还随时注意给予某些有困难的农民以物质上、精神上的帮助。各社热情地帮助周围农村，大大提高了农业生产合作社在农民群众中的威信，许多农民把农业生产合作社当做他们的社会主义学校。四川省原来的六百多个农业生产合作社，帮助附近已经具备条件的互助组建社。前往农业生产合作社参观的互助组组员们，都受到热情的接待。内江专区七十多个社自春耕到现在，共有十六万人到社里参观过。
