Strengthening the Management, Maintenance, and Repair of Drilling Machinery and Equipment
    Ren Zixiang

    In the first half of 1954, the number of drilling rigs put into operation by various geological exploration teams under the Ministry of Geology of the Central Government increased by 35.19 percent compared to 1953, and by 320 percent compared to 1952. Over the past year, with the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts and the active efforts of all staff, various geological exploration teams have initially improved the use and management of drilling machinery and equipment, and have gained some experience. Many geological exploration teams have implemented technical operating procedures, established regular maintenance and repair, material requisition and return, and storage and acceptance systems. Team 321 established a dedicated management team for diesel engines to strengthen the management of diesel engines, greatly reducing serious diesel engine accidents. The technical operating skills of workers in various teams have also generally improved. This is an important guarantee for completing increasingly heavy drilling tasks.

    However, judging from the current situation of drilling work, the high number of accidents and low efficiency remain extremely serious problems. According to statistics from six directly subordinate teams in the first half of this year, accidents resulted in a loss of 108,034 rig hours, accounting for 22.28 percent of the total drilling time, equivalent to 167 drilling rigs being out of operation for a month.

    One of the reasons for the high number of accidents is that there are still quite serious shortcomings in the management, use, maintenance, and repair of drilling machinery and equipment. First, many employees violate operating procedures. For example, a worker on a drilling rig at Team 621 of the Northwest Geological Bureau was holding a cigarette in one hand and a wrench in the other when tightening the chuck. He accidentally dropped the wrench into the hole, causing an accident. Workers on Drilling Rig No. 33 of Team 429 violated operating procedures and forcefully pulled out the drill string when dealing with an accident, resulting in the bending of the derrick beam. The phenomenon of neglecting cleanliness and failing to add lubricating oil on time during machine operation, resulting in mechanical wear, is even more common. Second, machines are not cared for, and daily maintenance and upkeep are not paid attention to, so normal operation of mechanical equipment cannot be maintained. For example, workers at Team 241 pushed mud pumps and pulleys down the mountain for convenience when transporting machines, resulting in the pulleys being broken. Team 621 of the Northwest Geological Bureau received five new 25-horsepower Wuxi diesel engines. Interns in the team disassembled all five diesel engines to learn about the machine's structure, resulting in damage and loss of many parts such as oil pumps, springs, and screws. To this day, one diesel engine cannot be used due to incomplete parts. Workers on Drilling Rig No. 17 of Team 241 damaged three mud pumps and two diesel engines in less than eight months due to neglecting machine maintenance and upkeep. More seriously, some teams dismantle parts from complete machines when parts are damaged. For example, Team 401 of the Central South Geological Bureau dismantled high-pressure oil pipes for diesel engines, centrifugal water pump impellers, thrust bearings on drilling rigs, and gears for mud pumps from new machines. The new machines were disassembled and incomplete, making them unusable and reducing equipment utilization. Third, mechanical repair and management systems have not been established or are not being seriously implemented, resulting in undue losses to mechanical equipment. For example, when the intermediate shaft ball bearing of Drilling Rig No. 54 of Team 241 made abnormal noises during drilling, the technicians in the engineering section suggested that the machine should be stopped immediately for repair. However, the machine leader of the hole replied: "We will repair it when the machine stops running. We won't repair it as long as it's still running." The axle bush of a drilling rig at Team 429 was already worn. The repair shop suggested repairing it at that time, but the workers on the drilling rig said: "We are about to finish work. Let's repair it after we finish." As a result, not only was the axle bush worn, but the cross shaft was also severely worn. Fourth, mechanical materials are not properly stored and no one is responsible, resulting in many materials being lost or damaged, or being stored in the open air, exposed to wind and rain, causing them to rust and become damaged. For example, Team 221 threw usable pipes such as thread protectors, intermediate shafts, steel grit, and drill bits into the scrap pile as waste products. Team 414 even threw unused drilling rigs by the roadside, with no one taking care of them. Team 501 only discovered that a drilling derrick and an electric motor were missing when the project needed them.

    The reasons for the above-mentioned serious problems, in addition to the objective limitations such as the fact that most of the workers are newly transferred and newly recruited, with low technical skills, unskilled operations, and a lack of necessary repair equipment, are mainly due to the fact that many cadres do not have sufficient understanding of the management, maintenance, and repair of drilling machinery and equipment, and do not provide enough education to employees on cherishing state materials, lack necessary technical measures, and management systems are chaotic.

    Various drilling machinery and equipment are extremely important material foundations in geological exploration work. In order to find a large number of mineral resources and meet the needs of construction, the state has equipped us with a large number of modern mechanical equipment, requiring us to carry out drilling work quickly and economically. However, with these excellent mechanical equipment, if we cannot use them carefully and reasonably, and if we cannot maintain them properly, it is impossible to fully exert the effectiveness of drilling machinery and equipment and ensure the completion of drilling tasks. In particular, the geological exploration teams are located in remote areas, with inconvenient transportation, and there are many difficulties in repair work. Once an accident occurs, it will delay a lot of time. In addition, the mechanical equipment is diverse and complex, and our technical level is still very low, and we cannot yet grasp the performance of the machines well. Under this circumstance, only by strengthening the management of various mechanical equipment, strictly observing technical operating procedures, and paying attention to daily maintenance and repair work can we avoid the losses caused by accidents, exert the effectiveness of mechanical equipment, and ensure the completion of drilling tasks.

    In order to fully exert the effectiveness of drilling machinery and equipment, eliminate accidents, and better complete the geological exploration tasks in 1954, the geological exploration teams must pay sufficient attention to the management, maintenance, and repair of mechanical equipment, and strengthen the ideological education of employees on cherishing state property, organize employees to conduct technical learning, so that the workers who operate various mechanical equipment can truly understand the performance of the machines and learn the correct operating methods, in order to continuously improve the technical level of employees. In operation, we must operate correctly in accordance with technical operating procedures, use mechanical equipment reasonably, and resolutely oppose the practice of forcing use regardless of the life of the machine. The operating conditions of the machine must be checked regularly, the machine must be kept clean and lubricated, and regular maintenance work must be carried out according to the mechanical maintenance and repair procedures and according to the wear and tear of the machine. In the storage of mechanical equipment, the storage regulations of mechanical equipment must be conscientiously implemented, and the unused mechanical equipment must be properly stored, so as to give full play to the effectiveness of all equipment. Finally, we must also strengthen the leadership of the repair work, increase the necessary equipment, and improve the repair capacity and technical level, so that it can truly meet the needs of drilling work.

    加强钻探机械设备的管理和维护检修工作
    任子翔
    一九五四年上半年中央地质部所属各地质勘探队开动的钻机较一九五三年增加了百分之三十五点一九，较一九五二年增加了百分之三百二十。一年多来，各地质勘探队在苏联专家的热诚帮助及全体职工的积极努力下，初步改进了钻探机械的使用与管理工作，取得了一些经验。许多地质勘探队贯彻了技术操作规程，订立了定期检修与领退料及保管验收制度。三二一队为了加强对柴油机的管理，建立了柴油机的专管小组，大大减少了严重的柴油机事故。各队工人的技术操作水平也有了普遍的提高。这对于完成日益繁重的钻探任务是一个重要的保证。
    但是，从当前钻探工作的情况来看，事故多、效率低，仍然是一个极其严重的问题。据今年上半年六个直属队的统计，因事故就损失了十万八千零三十四个台时，占整个钻进时间的百分之二十二点二八，相当于一百六十七台钻机停工一个月。
    事故多的原因之一，是由于钻探机械设备的管理使用和维护检修等工作还存在相当严重的缺点。首先是许多职工违反操作规程，如西北地质局六二一队有一台钻机的工人在紧卡盘时一手夹着纸烟，一手拿着搬子，一不小心，搬子掉入孔内，造成事故。四二九队三十三号钻机的工人在处理事故时，违反操作规程，强力起拔钻具，结果将天车梁拉弯。至于在机械运转中不注意清洁，不按时上润滑油，造成机械磨损的现象更为普遍。第二是对机器不加爱护，不注意日常的维护与保养工作，因而不能保持机械设备的正常运转。如二四一队工人在搬运机器时，为了方便，竟将泥浆泵、皮带轮从山上推下，结果将皮带轮折碎。西北地质局六二一队有五部新到的二十五马力无锡柴油机，该队实习生为了学习机器的构造，将五部柴油机全部拆开，结果损坏和丢失了油泵、弹簧及螺丝等不少零件，至今尚有一部柴油机因零件不全不能使用。二四一队十七号钻机工人由于忽视机器的维护保养工作，不到八个月损坏了三部泥浆泵，两部柴油机。更严重的是，有些队在机件损坏时竟拆卸完整机器上的零件。如中南地质局四○一队把新机器上的柴油机高压油管、离心水泵轮叶、钻机上的弹子盘、泥浆泵的齿轮等都拆了下来、新机器给拆得残缺不全，不能使用，降低了设备利用率。第三是没有建立或没有认真执行机械检修与管理制度，使机械设备遭到不应有的损失。如二四一队五十四孔钻进时中间轴滚珠轴承发生异声，工务科技术员提出应立即停车检修，但该孔机长却回答说：“只要机器不转动了，我们就检修，现在还转动我们就不修。”四二九队有一台钻机的轴瓦已经磨损，当时修配车间曾提出要修理，但钻机上的工人说：“我们快完工了，等我们完工后再修吧。”结果不但轴瓦磨损了，而且横轴也受到严重的磨损。第四是对机械器材的保管不善，无人负责，或则使许多器材丢掉损坏，或则露天存放，听任风吹雨打，以致生锈受损。如二二一队将能用的管材如护丝、中间轴、钢沙、钻头扔在废品堆里当废品处理。四一四队竟将不用的钻机扔在路旁，无人过问。五○一队到工程需用时，才发现丢了一台钻塔和一台电动机。
    产生上述严重问题的原因，除了由于工人大都是刚转业和新招收的，技术水平不高，操作不熟练以及缺乏必要的检修设备等客观条件的限制外，主要的是由于许多干部对钻探机械设备的管理和维护检修工作认识不足，对职工爱护国家器材的教育不够，缺乏必要的技术措施，以及管理制度上的混乱所造成的。
      钻探的各种机械设备是地质勘探工作中极其重要的物质基础。国家为了找出大量的矿产资源，满足建设的需要，替我们配备了大量近代化的机械设备，要求我们尽速地、经济地开展钻探工作。但是，有了这些优良的机械设备，如果不能精心地、合理地使用，如果不能妥善地保养，要充分发挥钻探机械设备的效能，保证钻探任务的完成是不可能的。特别是各个地质勘探队地处偏僻，交通不便，修配工作有很多困难，一旦发生事故就要耽误很多时间。再加上机械设备又多样复杂，我们的技术水平还很低，还不能很好地掌握机器的性能。在这种情况下，只有加强各种机械设备的管理，严格遵守技术操作规程，注意日常的维护与检修工作，才能避免事故所造成的损失，才能发挥机械设备的效能，保证完成钻探任务。
    为了充分发挥钻探机械设备的效能，消灭事故，以更好的完成一九五四年的地质勘探任务，各地质勘探队必须对机械设备的管理和维护检修工作，引起足够的重视，并加强对职工的爱护国家财产的思想教育，组织职工进行技术学习，使操作各种机械设备的工人，真正能了解机器的性能，学会正确的操作方法，以不断提高职工的技术水平。在操作中一定要按照技术操作规程正确地进行操作，合理地使用机械设备，坚决反对不管机器寿命而强行使用的做法。机器运转的情况必须经常进行检查，保持机器的清洁与润滑，并按照机械维护与检修规程，根据机械的磨损情况，进行定期的检修工作。在机械设备的保管上一定要认真地贯彻执行机械设备的保管条例，妥善地保管尚未使用的机器设备，以充分发挥所有设备的效能。最后，还要加强对修配工作的领导，增加必要的设备，提高修配能力与技术水平，使之真正能满足钻探工作的需要。
