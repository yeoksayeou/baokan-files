Our country is sending more than 1,500 students to the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries in 1954. Starting from August 14th, they will be going abroad in batches. Among them, more than 1,300 will be studying in the Soviet Union, and more than 140 will be going to countries such as the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Korea, and Mongolia. The number of students our country sends abroad to study is increasing year by year. This year, the number of students sent to various countries has increased by about 130% compared to 1953.

This year, our country's students sent to various countries will still focus on training industrial and transportation technology personnel, university faculty, and scientific research personnel, while also taking into account the needs of other fields.

This group of students going abroad are outstanding high school graduates, graduates of workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools, and some first-year university students and teachers selected from all over the country. These students, who are excellent in both character and academics, have undergone a period of study after being selected and admitted, laying the foundation for future studies in terms of language and ideology.

    我国派赴苏联等国的留学生分批出国
    一九五四年我国派赴苏联和各人民民主国家的留学生一千五百多名，从八月十四日起分批出国，其中赴苏联留学的一千三百多名，赴德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜、蒙古等国的学生共一百四十多名。我国派往外国留学的学生一年比一年增多，今年派往各国的留学生比一九五三年大约增加百分之一百三十左右。
    今年我国派往各国的留学生仍以培养工业交通技术人材和高等学校师资以及科学研究人材为主，同时照顾到其他各方面的需要。
    这批出国的留学生是从全国各地选拔出来的优秀高中毕业生、工农速成中学毕业生和部分大学一年级学生和教师。这些品学兼优的学生，在选拔录取后都经过一定时期的学习，在语文上和思想上都为将来的学习打下了基础。　（新华社）
