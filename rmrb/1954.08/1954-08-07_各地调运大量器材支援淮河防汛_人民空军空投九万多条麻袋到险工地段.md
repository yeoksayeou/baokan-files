Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 6th: Boats and trains fully loaded with flood control equipment are arriving in a continuous stream to Bengbu City, the heart of the Huai River area, and then quickly being transferred to various construction sites for flood control along the Huai River. Some of this flood control equipment comes from Shenyang, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Yanzhou, and Xuzhou in the north, while others come from Hangzhou, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Nanjing in the south. Currently, among the flood control equipment sent to the Huai River from various regions, there are 3.2 million gunny sacks, grass sacks, and reed bags, 120,000 pieces of timber, 210,000 reed mats, more than 23,000 kilograms of lead wire, more than 56,000 kilograms of hemp, more than 50 ships, 140 water pumps, and more than 100 tons of other equipment and materials. The timely arrival of this large batch of flood control equipment at the construction sites has greatly boosted the confidence of the participating migrant workers and cadres, and powerfully supported the flood control work. The Shilicheng dangerous section in Huaiyuan County experienced a dangerous situation on July 19th, and the situation was extremely urgent. Thanks to the timely arrival of more than 10,000 gunny sacks and more than 1,000 wooden piles, an emergency dike protection project was promptly initiated, and the embankment was finally saved.
	In order to promptly support the equipment needed for flood control on the Huai River, all regions have made their utmost efforts. They have gathered all kinds of flood control equipment at the fastest speed and loaded and transferred it as quickly as possible. The Financial and Economic Committee of the East China Administrative Council received the news on the evening of July 12th that the Huai River flood control urgently needed gunny sacks, and that night they sent cadres to Shanghai, Changzhou, Nanjing and other places to gather 180,000 gunny sacks. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Shandong Provincial People's Government heard at 11:00 p.m. on July 12th that the flood situation on the Huai River was tense and that flood control equipment was urgently needed. At 12:00 p.m. that night, it immediately decided to support 100,000 gunny sacks, loaded them onto vehicles overnight, and started shipping them all the next day. The railway department regarded the transportation of flood control equipment as the most important task at present, and dispatched special trains to transport it, increasing the transportation efficiency of flood control equipment and materials by more than double. The Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission and a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanjing and Bengbu provided a large number of communication equipment to strengthen communication for flood control on the Huai River, and sent troops to install wires in the rain. While sending flood control equipment and materials, many regions also brought letters of condolence to the people along the Huai River. Some letters said: "Flood control is a battle, and materials are like ammunition. Whatever you need, we will support you."
	Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 6th: The People's Liberation Army Air Force has dispatched aircraft to actively participate in flood control on the Huai River. In order to rush the transportation of flood control equipment, in addition to using trains, cars, ships, and sailing boats, the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission specially dispatched three transport planes to assist. The heroic People's Air Force fighters have continuously overcome difficulties such as bad weather during the flight and timely completed the arduous task of airdropping flood control equipment. To date, the People's Air Force aircraft have airdropped more than 90,000 gunny sacks to dangerous construction sites for flood control on the Huai River. Many dangerous construction sites have experienced dangerous situations due to the impact of torrential rains and huge waves, but the safety of the dams has finally been ensured due to the timely acquisition of flood control equipment airdropped by the People's Air Force aircraft. The airdropping of flood control equipment by the People's Air Force aircraft has greatly encouraged the migrant workers participating in flood control on the Huai River. There was cheers on the embankment during the airdrop. Liu Guoran, an old migrant worker in his sixties, said with emotion: "In the era of reactionary rule, airplanes dropped bullets and bombs. I have never seen airplanes drop gunny sacks for the people for flood control. Now Chairman Mao has sent airplanes to help us. We must stand firm and defend the dikes and protect our homes."

    各地调运大量器材支援淮河防汛
    人民空军空投九万多条麻袋到险工地段
    【新华社蚌埠六日电】满载着防汛器材的船只和列车，源源开到淮河心脏蚌埠市，然后迅速转运到淮河防汛各处工地。这些防汛器材，有的来自北方的沈阳、天津、青岛、济南、兖州和徐州，有的来自南方的杭州、上海、苏州和南京等地。目前，各地送到淮河的防汛器材中，已有麻袋、草袋、蒲包三百二十万条，木料十二万根，芦席二十一万条，铅丝二万三千多公斤，麻五万六千多公斤，轮船五十多只，抽水机一百四十部，以及其他各种器材物资一百多吨。这一大批防汛器材及时运到工地后，大大鼓舞了参加淮河防汛民工和干部的信心，有力地支援防汛工作。怀远县十里城险段在七月十九日曾发生险象，情况十分紧急。由于及时得到一万多条麻袋、一千多根木桩，及时做起抢险护堤工程，终于保住了大堤。
    为了及时支援淮河防汛用的器材，各地都尽了最大的努力。他们以最快的速度，集结各种防汛器材，并且尽快地装车转运。华东行政委员会财政经济委员会在七月十二日晚上得到淮河防汛急需麻袋的消息，当夜就派干部在上海、常州、南京等地，集结了十八万条麻袋。山东省人民政府财政经济委员会在七月十二日晚上十一时听说淮河汛情紧张，急需防汛器材。当晚十二时立即决定支援十万条麻袋，并连夜装车，第二天就全部启运。铁路部门更把运输防汛器材当作当前最重要的任务，抽出专车运送，使防汛器材物资的运输效率提高一倍多。中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会和驻南京蚌埠的人民解放军某部为加强淮河防汛的通讯联系，支援了大批通讯器材；并派部队冒雨装设电线。许多地区在送来防汛器材物资的同时，还给沿淮人民带来了慰问信。有的信上说：“防汛就是战斗，物资好比弹药，你们要什么，我们就支援什么。”
    【新华社蚌埠六日电】人民解放军空军派飞机积极参加淮河防汛。为了赶运防汛器材，除以火车、汽车、轮船、帆船参加运送外，中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会特派三架运输机，前来协助。英勇的人民空军战士，在飞行中不断克服天气恶劣等困难，及时完成了艰巨的空投防汛器材任务。到目前止，人民空军的飞机在淮河防汛各处险工地段上，已空投麻袋九万多条。很多险工地段由于暴雨巨浪的冲击曾发生险象，但因及时获得人民空军的飞机空投防汛器材，终于保证了堤坝的安全。人民空军的飞机空投防汛器材，给参加淮河防汛的民工极大鼓舞。空投时堤上一片欢呼，六十多岁的老民工刘国然感动地说：“反动派统治时代，飞机投下的都是子弹和炸弹，我从来没有看见过飞机为人民防汛投麻袋。现在毛主席派飞机来帮助我们了，我们一定要坚守堤防，保堤保家。”
