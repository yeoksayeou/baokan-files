Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 6th: The State Council of the Central People's Government sent a telegram of condolences on August 1st to workers, farmers, troops, students, government staff and all work comrades participating in flood prevention and rescue on the Yangtze River. The text of the telegram is as follows:

    During this year's flood season, due to special meteorological conditions, heavy rains were concentrated in the Yangtze River basin for a long period, resulting in the largest flood on the Yangtze River in nearly a century. Thanks to your tireless efforts in guarding and rescuing day and night under the leadership of Party committees and people's governments at all levels, you have protected the safety of people's lives, property, and agricultural production in important cities, industrial and mining areas, transportation facilities, and vast areas along the river, even exceeding the highest water levels in previous years. Your heroic struggle plays an important role in ensuring the smooth progress of our socialist construction. This is a glorious and arduous task that should be appreciated and respected by the people of the whole country.

    Currently, flood prevention on the Yangtze River has entered the most critical stage, and it is also approaching the final victory. We extend our deepest condolences to you and hope that you will pay close attention, resolutely defend, overcome all difficulties, and make persistent efforts to strive for the final victory over the flood.

    政务院电慰参加长江防汛抢险的全体人员
    【新华社武汉六日电】中央人民政府政务院八月一日致电慰问参加长江防汛抢险的工人、农民、部队、学生、机关工作人员和全体工作同志。电文如下：
    今年汛期，因为气象上的特殊情况，暴雨长期集中在长江流域，以致长江发生了近百年来未有的大水。由于你们在各级党委与人民政府的领导下，不避艰险，不辞劳苦，夜以继日地防守和抢护，在超过历年最高水位的情况下，保卫了沿江重要城市、工矿、交通和广大地区人民生命财产与农业生产的安全。你们这种英勇的斗争，对于保证我国社会主义建设的顺利进行，起着重要的作用。这是一个光荣而艰巨的任务，应该受到全国人民的感激和尊敬。
    目前长江防汛已经进入最紧急的阶段，同时也是接近最后胜利的阶段，特向你们致深切的慰问；并盼严密注意，坚决防守，克服一切困难，再接再厉，为争取最后战胜洪水而奋斗。
