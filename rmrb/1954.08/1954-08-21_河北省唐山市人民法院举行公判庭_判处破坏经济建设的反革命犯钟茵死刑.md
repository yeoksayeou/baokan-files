The Tangshan People's Court of Hebei Province held a public trial on the morning of August 12th to try the case of counter-revolutionary element Zhong Yin sabotaging national economic construction. Present at the public trial were leading comrades from the Tangshan municipal Party and government organs, workers and their families from various factories and mines, government staff, and representatives of the citizens, totaling more than two thousand people.

After the presiding judge, Gao Xiaocun, announced the opening of the court, the defendant Zhong Yin was brought to the court, and he was questioned about his name, age, occupation, etc. Then, Xin Wenzhang, Deputy Procurator-General of the Tangshan People's Procuratorate, represented the state in filing a public prosecution in this case. The content of the public prosecution was as follows: In September 1953, a coal mining combine newly purchased from the Soviet Union was transported to the Linxi Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan. The Linxi Mine held a combine driver training class, with the defendant Zhong Yin, a technician from the mine's electromechanical section, responsible for technical guidance. The workers in the training class did not understand the mechanical structure and operating technology of the combine. Defendant Zhong Yin took advantage of this gap to sabotage the combine machine twice. The first incident of sabotage occurred on September 7, 1953. When the defendant was directing workers in the training class to disassemble the second-stage reduction gear of the coal-cutting section of the combine, he deliberately reversed the disassembly sequence and maliciously ordered the workers to hammer the center shaft with an eight-pound hammer. At that time, a worker asked him, "Is it okay to hammer it?" "No machine can withstand such hammering!" But the defendant Zhong said, "Hammer it, it's right!" As a result, the inner ring of the 3528 roller bearing was damaged. This part could not be manufactured domestically at the time and had to be reordered from the Soviet Union. The second sabotage incident occurred on December 14, 1953. The defendant Zhong was responsible for directing workers to connect the coal-cutting section and the electric section of the combine in the mine. He knew that he was the only one among the employees at the scene who understood the structure of the machine. Therefore, when workers who did not understand the installation technology were about to damage the machine parts by connecting the coal-cutting section and the electric section in the wrong way, he not only did not correct the workers' mistakes but also rejected the employees' reasonable suggestion to check the machine. He maliciously ordered the workers to continue the wrong operating method, resulting in the inner and outer rings of the 306 ball bearing in the oil splash wheel being crushed into thirteen pieces, and the small shaft was bent. Both times the damage to the machine parts could stop the operation of the combine machine. Technical appraisal proved that reversing the disassembly sequence was a violation of the operating method stipulated for the Donbass coal mining combine, and hammering the center shaft with great force was the cause of the damage to the inner ring of the 3528 roller bearing.

After explaining the course of the incident, the prosecutor pointed out that the two sabotage incidents were intentional. The basis is: 1. Defendant Zhong is a graduate of the mechanical department of a university and has more than four years of practical experience in mechanical work, understanding general mechanical principles. 2. He had studied the technical operation of the combine machine at the Datong Coal Mine and had read the book "Donbass Coal Mining Combine," knowing the disassembly sequence of the second-stage reduction gear of the coal-cutting section as stipulated in this book. 3. Before disassembling the second-stage reduction gear of the coal-cutting section of the combine, the training class instructor, He Daiwen, had explained the disassembly sequence of this part to him in detail and specifically told him: "It cannot be disassembled if the sequence is reversed." 4. Defendant Zhong violated the disassembly sequence for the first time and ordered workers to hammer the center shaft with great force. The second time, he allowed and ordered workers to use the wrong operating methods. He not only did not ask the leaders of the Linxi Mine for instructions in advance, nor did he discuss it with any workers or technicians, but repeatedly rejected the reasonable suggestions of employees.

Next, the prosecutor introduced the history of the defendant Zhong Yin, pointing out that he was a counter-revolutionary element who had slipped through the net. As early as 1945, after the liberation of Andong City, Liaoning Province, defendant Zhong joined the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Andong City counter-revolutionary organization M·M·Group, as one of the core members of the group, and carried out a series of counter-revolutionary activities: 1. He was responsible for the organizational work of the M·M·Group, developing more than 50 bandits in one month; 2. He initiated and led counter-revolutionary propaganda, writing and distributing a large number of reactionary leaflets, and secretly setting up a small radio station to broadcast rumors; 3. He proposed the assassination of Lu Qien, the military and political leader of our Andong City. Later, this counter-revolutionary organization was cracked down on by us, and defendant Zhong fled to Shenyang Medical College in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit area, continued to collude with secret agents, undermine the patriotic student movement, instigate students to move the school, and expel progressive professors. In 1948, defendant Zhong sneaked into Zhengding North China University, disguised himself as progressive. After studying at North China University, he was transferred to the Linxi Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan to do technical work. In October 1950, when the American invading army attacked the Yalu River, defendant Zhong thought that the time had come and that the American Chiang Kai-shek bandits were about to make a comeback, so he immediately returned to Andong City, attempting to join forces with lurking American Chiang Kai-shek special agents to overthrow our people's regime. Later, after the American invading army was defeated and retreated, he returned to Tangshan.

In August 1952, after the facts of defendant Zhong's counter-revolutionary activities in Andong and other places were clarified, the Tangshan People's Court sentenced him to two years' imprisonment with a suspended sentence. During the probation period, defendant Zhong still showed no remorse and continued to spread rumors, sabotage the resistance against America and aid to Korea, sow discord between China and the Soviet Union, and disrupt production order.

The prosecutor finally pointed out that the above facts fully demonstrate that defendant Zhong Yin is a counter-revolutionary element who is determined to be an enemy of the people. He received lenient treatment from our people's government, but not only did he fail to correct his mistakes and atone for his crimes, but he became even more frantically hostile to the people. He maliciously sabotaged the advanced production tool newly purchased from the Soviet Union, the Donbass coal mining combine, constituting a serious criminal act. In order to protect the country's socialist industrial construction, combat the sabotage activities of enemy agents and counter-revolutionary elements, and educate the broad masses of workers to raise their revolutionary vigilance, this case is now submitted to the Tangshan People's Court for trial according to law to severely punish the counter-revolutionary criminal Zhong Yin.

After the prosecution was completed, the presiding judge asked the defendant, "Do you have anything to say?" Because the defendant had been given full right of defense during the investigation by the People's Procuratorate and the preliminary hearing by the People's Court, the technical appraisal report and all evidence were shown to the defendant, and the indictment was delivered to the defendant before the public trial, the defendant was unable to argue in the face of the ironclad facts and confessed his criminal behavior. At this point in the trial, the defense counsel defended the defendant, and the prosecutor made a reply. After the defense and reply were completed, all the judges temporarily adjourned the court and collectively deliberated on the case. After all the judges returned to the court from the deliberation room, the presiding judge read out the verdict. The verdict, after narrating the facts of the counter-revolutionary activities of the defendant Zhong Yin, pointed out that the crimes of the counter-revolutionary element Zhong Yin were extremely serious. In accordance with Article 9, Paragraph 1, Article 10, Paragraph 3, Article 7, Paragraph 4, and Article 17 of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolution," the defendant Zhong Yin was sentenced to death, to be executed immediately, and deprived of political rights for life.

The trial ended at this point, and the presiding judge announced the adjournment. Warm applause and cheers erupted from the audience, unanimously supporting the court's just verdict.

    河北省唐山市人民法院举行公判庭
    判处破坏经济建设的反革命犯钟茵死刑
    河北省唐山市人民法院于八月十二日上午举行公判庭，审判反革命分子钟茵破坏国家经济建设的案件。出席公判庭旁听的有唐山市党政机关的领导同志、各厂矿的职工及其家属、机关工作人员及市民代表等两千多人。
    审判长高晓村宣布开庭后，传呼被告钟茵到庭，讯问了被告的姓名、年龄、职业等。继由唐山市人民检察署副检察长辛文章代表国家对这一案件提起公诉。公诉的内容是：一九五三年九月，我国新从苏联购买的采煤康拜因运到了唐山市开滦煤矿林西矿。林西矿举办了一个康拜因司机训练班，由这个矿的机电科技术人员被告钟茵负责技术指导工作；在训练班学习的工人，都不懂康拜因的机械构造和操作技术。被告钟茵即利用这一空隙，先后两次对康拜因机实行破坏。第一次的破坏事件发生在一九五三年九月七日。被告在训练班指挥工人拆卸康拜因机截煤部第二段减速装置时，故意颠倒拆卸顺序，并恶意地命令工人用八磅重的铁锤捶打中心轴。当时有工人问他：“打锤行吗？”“啥机器搁得住这样打！”但钟犯却说：“打吧，对呀！”结果打坏了三五二八滚柱轴承内圈，这个机件当时在国内还不能制造，必须重新到苏联去订货。第二次的破坏事件发生在一九五三年十二月十四日。钟犯在矿井下负责指挥工人连接康拜因截煤部和电动部的工作。他明知在现场的职工中只有他懂得机器的构造，因而在不懂安装技术的工人按照错误的方法连接截煤部与电动部将要损坏机件的时候，他不但不纠正工人的错误，反而拒绝了职工要检查机器的合理建议，恶意地命令工人继续实行错误的操作方法，结果把溅油轮部分三○六滚珠轴承内外圈挤碎成十三块，把小轴挤弯了。这两次机件的损坏，都能停止康拜因机器的运转。经技术鉴定证明：颠倒拆卸顺序，是违反顿巴斯采煤康拜因所规定的操作方法的，大力捶打中心轴是造成三五二八滚柱轴承内圈损坏的原因。
    公诉人在说明事件的经过以后指出，这两次的破坏事件都是有意的。根据是：一、钟犯是高等学校机械科毕业的学生，并且有四年以上机械工作的实际经验，懂得一般机械原理。二、他曾经到大同煤矿学习过康拜因机的技术操作，看过顿巴斯采煤康拜因一书，知道这本书所规定的截煤部第二段减速装置的拆卸顺序。三、在拆卸康拜因机截煤部第二段减速装置前，训练班教员贺代文曾经详细地向他交代过这部分的拆卸顺序，并且特别告诉他：“颠倒了顺序，是拆不下来的。”四、钟犯第一次违反拆卸顺序，并命令工人大力捶打中心轴，第二次放任和命令工人使用错误的操作方法，不但没有在事前请示林西矿的领导人，没有和任何工人或技术人员研究过，而且一再拒绝职工的合理建议。
    接着，公诉人介绍了被告钟茵的历史，指出他是一个漏网的反革命分子。早在一九四五年辽宁省安东市解放以后，钟犯就参加了蒋匪安东市反革命组织M·M·团，为该团的骨干分子之一，进行了一系列的反革命活动：一、负责M·M·团的组织工作，一个月内发展匪徒五十多人；二、发起和领导反革命宣传，大量地编写和散发反动传单，秘密架设小型电台广播谣言；三、提议刺杀我安东市军政首长吕其恩。其后，这一反革命组织被我破获，钟犯逃到蒋匪区沈阳医学院，继续勾结特务，破坏爱国学生运动，鼓动学生迁校，驱逐进步教授。一九四八年钟犯混进了正定华北大学，伪装进步，在华北大学学习后，被调到唐山市开滦煤矿林西矿做技术工作。一九五○年十月，当美国侵略军进攻到鸭绿江边时，钟犯以为时机已到，美蒋匪帮就要卷土重来，立即回到安东市，企图与潜伏的美蒋特务合流，推翻我人民政权。后来美国侵略军败退，他才回到唐山。
    一九五二年八月，钟犯在安东等地从事反革命活动的事实被我查清以后，由唐山市人民法院判处他徒刑二年、缓期执行。在缓刑期间，钟犯仍毫无悔过之心，继续散布谣言，破坏抗美援朝，挑拨中苏友谊，扰乱生产秩序。
    公诉人最后指出，上述事实充分说明被告钟茵是一个坚决与人民为敌的反革命分子。他受到我人民政府的宽大处理，不但不痛改前非，立功赎罪，反而更加疯狂地仇视人民，先后两次恶毒地破坏了我国新从苏联购入的先进生产工具——顿巴斯采煤康拜因，构成了严重的犯罪行为。为了保障国家社会主义工业建设，打击敌特反革命分子的破坏活动，教育广大职工提高革命警惕，现特将此案提请唐山市人民法院依法进行审判，给反革命犯钟茵以严厉制裁。
    公诉完毕后，审判长问被告：“有什么说的吗？”由于这一案件在人民检察署侦查与人民法院预审的过程中已经给了被告以充分的辩护权，将技术鉴定书和全部证据给被告看过，并在举行公判前将起诉书送达被告，因而被告在铁的事实面前无法狡辩，供认了自己的犯罪行为。审判至此，由辩护人为被告辩护，公诉人又做了答辩。辩护和答辩完毕后，全体审判人员暂时退庭，集体评议这一案件。当全体审判人员从评议室回到庭上以后，审判长宣读了判决书。判决书在叙述了被告钟茵的反革命活动的事实后指出：反革命分子钟茵罪恶极为严重，特依据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例第九条第一款、第十条第三款、第七条第四款及第十七条的规定，判处被告钟茵死刑，立即执行。剥夺政治权利终身。
    审判至此结束，审判长宣布闭庭。旁听席上发出热烈的掌声和欢呼声，一致拥护法庭的正义判决。
