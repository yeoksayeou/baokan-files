Shanxi's newly built flood control and drainage projects this year have played a significant role in combating floods during the flood season and ensuring increased agricultural production. This year, Shanxi has experienced heavy and concentrated rainfall. According to statistics from early August, the rainfall in Changzhi, Linfen, Yanbei, Yuncheng, Yuci and other regions is one to one and seven times greater than the same period last year. However, thanks to the construction of flood control projects and the active leadership of party and government organs at all levels in guiding the masses to carry out flood control and drainage work, not only were floods overcome, but increased production was also ensured. This year, a total of 297 new flood control projects were built throughout the province, with the government investing more than 6.2 billion yuan. More than 10,900 mass flood control channels were also opened, and these projects have all played their due role. In total, they have protected 229 cities and villages, protected more than 410,000 mu of land, silted up more than 9,100 mu of land, and drained 23,600 mu of arable land. According to past experience, it is estimated that protecting one mu of land can guarantee an increase of at least 110 jin of grain, silting up one mu of land can increase production by 100 jin, and draining one mu of waterlogged land can restore production by 150 jin, for a total increase of more than 49 million jin of grain. In Shiqiao and other five villages in Ying County, 6,000 mu of land were washed away by floods last year, resulting in a reduction in production of 50% to 80%. This year, the government helped to repair flood control projects, which not only guaranteed the harvest of more than 20,000 mu of land in the five villages, but also allowed for flood irrigation of more than 30,000 mu of land. In Jiannan Shuibo, seven villages in Hongtong and Zhaocheng counties, more than 3,000 mu of land were frequently subjected to waterlogging. This year, the government sent technical cadres to help the masses survey and plan, and provided loans to help them. In five days, they built a drainage canal 956 meters long, so that the crops on 1,100 mu of waterlogged land, 1,200 mu of grassland, and 700 mu of alkaline land grew very well. It is expected that each mu can increase production by more than 100 jin of grain. (Our newspaper's Shanxi reporter station)

    山西省防洪工程在防汛中起了很大作用
    山西今年新修的防洪排涝工程，在战胜汛期洪水保证农业增产上已起了很大作用。山西今年雨量大而且集中，据八月上旬统计，长治、临汾、雁北、运城、榆次等专区的雨量，都大于去年同一时期一倍到一点七倍，但由于兴修了防洪工程，各级党政机关又积极领导群众开展防洪排涝工作，不但战胜了洪水，还保证了增产。今年全省新修的防洪工程共有二百九十七处，政府共投资六十二亿余元。群众性的防洪渠还开了一万零九百多条，这些工程都发挥了应有的效能。计共保护城村二百二十九座，护地四十一万多亩，淤地九千一百多亩，排涝空出能耕土地二万三千六百亩。按以往经验估计，护一亩地保证最少可增产一百一十斤粮食，淤一亩地增产一百斤，排出积水一亩能恢复产量一百五十斤，共可增产原粮四千九百多万斤。应县石桥等五村，去年被洪水冲毁六千亩土地，减产五成到八成，今年政府帮助修好防洪工程，不但保障了五个村二万多亩土地的丰收，还可引洪灌溉三万多亩土地。洪洞、赵城两县涧南水泊七个村，有三千多亩地经常遭受涝灾，今年政府派技术干部帮助群众勘查计划，并贷款帮助，五天时间修成长达九百五十六公尺的排水大渠，使一千一百亩的水涝地、一千二百亩草滩地和七百亩淋碱地的庄稼长得很好，预计每亩亦可增产百多斤粮。（本报山西记者站）
