Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives are actively organizing the supply of goods to ensure sufficient resources for the peak autumn and winter seasons.

The Inner Mongolia state-owned department store system signed supply contracts with central-level purchasing and supply stations in the third quarter, an increase of 75.4 percent over the second quarter, and had already transferred approximately 20 billion yuan worth of goods by the beginning of the third quarter. The Coal Industry and Building Materials Company of Pingdi Quan Administrative District signed 23 contracts with state-owned industrial and commercial departments in Beijing and Tianjin in July, and large quantities of materials are being shipped continuously. The Hulunbuir League Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to purchase locally 3,200 carts and rubber-wheeled carts, more than 1,900 head of draught animals, and many agricultural implements. Supply and marketing cooperatives in areas such as Kezuo Middle Banner, Morin Dawa Banner, and Zhuozi County have already transported large quantities of means of production and means of livelihood.

Among the materials prepared by state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions, there are many new varieties and new styles of goods. The Hohhot Department Store has increased its commodities by 1,496 varieties compared to the beginning of the year, and the Chahar League Department Store has increased its commodities by 1,000 varieties, mostly items popular with the masses. Supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas are also vigorously promoting new agricultural implements. The Jerim League Supply and Marketing Cooperative has already allocated 63 harvesters, 16 hay rakes, and 653 eight-inch walking plows.

    内蒙古国营商业部门和合作社
    积极组织货源迎接秋冬贸易旺季
    内蒙古自治区国营商业部门和供销合作社为了保证秋冬旺季的物资供应，现正积极组织货源。
    内蒙古国营百货系统在第三季度和中央一级采购供应站签订的供应合同，比第二季度增加了百分之七十五点四，在第三季度初就调进了约值二百亿元的商品。平地泉行政区的煤业建筑器材公司，七月里就和北京、天津的国营工业和商业部门签订合同二十三件，大批的物资正在源源取运。呼伦贝尔盟供销合作社仅准备在当地购进的生产资料，就有大车和胶轮车三千二百辆，耕畜一千九百多头，以及许多农具。科左中旗、莫力达瓦旗、卓资县等地的供销合作社都已经运到大批的生产资料和生活资料。
    各地国营商业部门和供销合作社准备的物资中，有不少新品种、新式样的商品。呼和浩特百货公司的商品，比年初增加了一千四百九十六种，察哈尔盟百货公司增加了一千种，多是群众喜用的东西。部分地区的供销合作社还大力推广新式农具。哲里木盟供销合作社已经往下调拨了收割机六十三台、搂草机十六台、八吋步犁六百五十三台。
