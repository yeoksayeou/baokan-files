    The Li Xikui Shunting Team Celebrates its Fifth Anniversary

    August 15th marks the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the national railway shunting banner – the Shenyang South Station Li Xikui Youth Shunting Team.

    Over the past five years, the Li Xikui shunting team, mastering advanced operating methods, has consistently overfulfilled its production tasks. According to preliminary statistics, from 1950 to 1952, the team saved the nation more than 24,000 car-hours. In 1953 and the first half of 1954, operational efficiency increased by more than 40% compared to the previous three years.

    After the Li Xikui Shunting Method was promoted throughout the national railways, it achieved great results. By the end of 1951, 66 larger freight car marshalling stations across the country were implementing this method, which improved the long-standing phenomenon of chaotic marshalling and greatly improved shunting efficiency. By the end of 1953, this method had been implemented throughout the national railways and had spread to the Fushun Mining Bureau, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and forest railways. Brother stations sent outstanding shunting teams to Shenyang Station to learn from the Li Xikui shunting team.

    The Li Xikui shunting team paid special attention to continuously improving work efficiency and learning from the advanced experiences of others. In the competition to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day in 1953, the team successfully tested the "Inertia Coasting Shunting Method," which later developed into the "Multiple-Coupling Inertia Coasting Method." Using this method, four groups of vehicles can be separated at one time, even under the slowest conditions, efficiency can be improved by more than three times.

    Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members have played a significant role in the Li Xikui shunting team. All fourteen people who have worked in the team over the past five years have joined the Youth League, and seven have joined the Communist Party. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, their awareness has continuously improved. Communist Party member Li Xikui has been honored as a national railway and Shenyang City labor model four times, but he said: "We are doing very poorly, we should always strive to learn."

    The Li Xikui shunting team has trained many cadres in the past five years: former shunter Li Xikui served as the deputy stationmaster of Shenyang South Station, the second shunter Li Zhongxin served as the stationmaster on duty at the station, and the third shunter Wang Guobin served as the Party branch secretary of the workshop. In addition, seven others have been promoted to line duty officers and shunters, respectively.

    Currently, the Li Xikui shunting team is working hard to achieve new achievements - to fully complete the team's plan. (Li Wenguo)

    李锡奎调车组成立五周年
    八月十五日是全国铁路调车旗帜——沈阳南站李锡奎青年调车组成立五周年。
    五年来李锡奎调车组掌握着先进作业方法，一贯地超额完成本组的生产任务。从一九五○年到一九五二年三年中，据初步统计，该组为国家节省两万四千多车小时。一九五三年和一九五四年上半年，与前三年相比，又提高作业效率百分之四十以上。
    李锡奎调车法在全国铁路推广后，取得了很大成效。一九五一年底，全国铁路有六十六个较大的货车编组站推行这一方法，对长期存在的编组混乱现象有所改善，提高调车作业效率很大。到一九五三年末，这个方法已推行于全国铁路，并传播到抚顺矿务局与鞍山钢铁公司以及森林铁路，各兄弟车站纷纷派优秀调车组到沈阳站向李锡奎调车组学习。
    李锡奎调车组在工作中特别注意了不断提高工作效率和学习别人的先进经验。在一九五三年迎接“五一”劳动节的竞赛中，该组又试验成功了“惰力溜放调车法”，以后又发展为“多钩惰力溜放法”，采用这一方法后，一次可以崩出四组车辆，即在最慢的条件下，也可以提高效率三倍以上。
    共产党员和青年团员在李锡奎调车组中起了很大作用。五年中在该组工作过的十四人全部参加了青年团，并有七人参加了共产党。在党的培养和教育下，他们的觉悟不断提高。共产党员李锡奎曾四次获得全国铁路及沈阳市劳动模范的光荣称号，但他表示：“我们做得很差，什么时候都应努力学习。”
    李锡奎调车组在五年中培养了不少干部：前任调车员李锡奎担任了沈阳南站的副站长，二任调车员李忠信担任了该站值班站长，三任调车员汪国斌担任了车间党支部书记，此外还有七人分别被提升为线路值班员和调车员等职务。
    目前，李锡奎调车组正为争取新的成绩——全面完成小组计划而努力。　（李文国）
