Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have completed their annual sea salt production tasks five months ahead of schedule. As of the end of July, they had completed 100.98% of the original annual production target; the output exceeded any year before and after liberation, equivalent to 123.21% of 1953.

This year, inspired by the general task of the state's transitional period, salt workers and salt farmers in Guangdong and Guangxi have shown unprecedented enthusiasm for production, launching labor competitions and initially carrying out technical reforms. Since the beginning of this year, many salt fields have held production technology experience exchange meetings, and many new inventions and creations have emerged. For example, Wang Juanzheng, a salt worker from the Yulin Salt Field in Hainan, created the "circulating water method," and Pan Zhiming, a salt farmer from Huiyang, created the "first dividing ponds then jointly drying and raking salt" and "rotating pond salt drying" methods in sand drying salt fields, all of which have achieved success. After many other salt fields promoted advanced experiences such as "long-term crystallization" and "bittern drainage," they generally increased production by more than 15%.

This year, all salt fields have actively carried out mutual aid and cooperation movements. As of the end of May, the salt households organized in the eastern Guangdong salt fields accounted for 15.05% of the total number of households in the area, fully demonstrating the superiority of being organized. According to a survey by the Renzhen Field Office in Huiyang, in the first quarter of production, the unit area yield of the 42 salt households in Yuandun Village of the cooperative was 56% higher than the average yield of individual households, and 37% higher than the highest-yielding individual household, Lu Wangcai.

    广东广西两省全年海盐生产计划提前完成
    两广海盐生产已提前五个月完成了全年任务。截至七月底止，已完成全年原定生产任务的百分之一○○点九八；产量超过了解放前后的任何一年，等于一九五三年的百分之一二三点二一。
    今年两广盐工、盐民在国家过渡时期的总任务鼓舞下，生产情绪空前高涨，掀起了劳动竞赛，初步开展了技术改革工作。今年以来，许多盐场都开过生产技术经验交流会议，出现了不少新的发明和创造。如海南榆亚盐场盐工王卷征创造了“循环走水法”、惠阳盐民潘枝明创造在晒沙盐田的“先分池后合晒扒盐”和“轮池晒盐”方法等，都获得了成绩。其他许多盐场推广了“长期结晶”“排苦卤”等先进经验之后，一般都能增加产量百分之十五以上。
    今年各盐场都积极开展了互助合作运动。粤东盐场截至五月底止，组织起来的盐?已占全区总?数的百分之十五点零五，充分显示出组织起来的优越性。根据惠阳稔山场务所的调查，该所园墩村四十二个盐?在第一季的生产中、合?组的单位面积产量较单干户的平均产量高出百分之五十六，较单干户中产量最高的吕旺才?高出百分之三十七。
