    The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government jointly convened the first National Higher Medical Education Conference in Beijing from July 29th to August 5th. More than 290 people attended the conference, including the directors of health bureaus of major regions, the directors of health departments and bureaus of some provinces and cities, the heads of higher medical colleges, some professors, and well-known traditional Chinese medicine doctors from Beijing.
    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, higher medical education has undergone rectification and reform, departments have been adjusted, leadership backbones have been supplemented, the political work of the schools has been initially established, a large number of teachers have been trained and improved, and school buildings and equipment have been expanded, so that the number of students enrolled has increased year by year. In the past few years, more than 11,000 senior medical and health technical personnel have been trained; at present, the number of students in medical colleges across the country has increased to more than 27,000, laying the foundation for training more senior medical and health technical cadres with both ability and integrity for the country in the future. On the other hand, there have also been many shortcomings and problems in medical education in the past few years, mainly the unclear educational policy, the unclear training goals of various majors, and the lack of unified teaching plans and teaching outlines. Also, the learning from the Soviet Union has not been done well enough, especially the lack of systematic translation and introduction of Soviet textbooks, which makes the teaching work lack a basis. Insufficient attention has also been paid to the study and research of the valuable heritage of traditional Chinese medicine. The delegates made appropriate assessments and criticisms of the advantages and disadvantages of past work.
    This conference determined that the specific guiding task of higher medical education is: to train senior medical and health personnel with certain Marxist-Leninist literacy, sound physiques, and mastery of advanced medical and health specialized knowledge and technology in a planned way to serve socialist construction and the people's health care. To this end, we must actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, continue to carry out teaching reforms, carry forward the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, earnestly unite Chinese and Western medicine personnel, vigorously improve existing teachers, train new teachers, strive to exert potential forces, and improve teaching quality in order to complete the task of training senior medical and health cadres.
    After carefully studying the advanced experience of Soviet medical education and conducting thorough discussions in light of China's actual conditions, the conference determined the professional settings and clarified the professional training goals; formulated a unified teaching plan, and also made principled regulations for the preparation of teaching outlines. In addition, it also discussed the training and improvement of teachers, the development of scientific research work, the specific tasks of various colleges in training cadres, the leadership relationship of medical colleges, the specific content of systematically learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in a comprehensive manner, learning the valuable heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, training health cadres of ethnic minorities, and the principles of relocating schools and building new school buildings. Traditional Chinese medicine doctors who were invited to the meeting also participated in the discussion.
    The delegates also fully exchanged experiences in improving medical education over the past few years. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央人民政府高等教育部和卫生部
    联合召开第一届全国高等医学教育会议
    中央人民政府高等教育部和卫生部在七月二十九日到八月五日联合在北京召开了第一届全国高等医学教育会议。出席会议的有各大区卫生局长、部分省、市的卫生厅、局长、各高等医药院校的负责人和一部分教授以及北京市著名中医师等共二百九十多人。
    解放以来，高等医学教育在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，进行了整顿和改革工作，调整了院系；补充了领导骨干；初步建立了学校的政治工作；培养和提高了大批师资；扩充了校舍和设备，因而招生名额逐年增加。数年来，已培养出一万一千多名高级医药卫生技术人材；目前全国医药院校在校学生已增至二万七千多名，为今后给国家培养更多的德才兼备的高级医药卫生技术干部打下了基础。另一方面，几年来医学教育工作中也存在着很多缺点和问题，主要是教育方针不明确，各专业培养目标不明确，以及教学计划、教学大纲的不统一。在学习苏联方面也做得很不够，尤其是没有系统地翻译和介绍苏联教材，使教学工作缺乏依据。对学习和研究祖国医学宝贵遗产也未引起重视。到会代表对以往工作中的优缺点，作了适当的估计和批评。
    这次会议确定了高等医学教育的具体方针任务是：有计划地培养为社会主义建设和人民保健事业服务的、具有一定的马克思列宁主义修养的、体魄健全的、掌握先进医药卫生专门知识和技术的高级医药卫生人材。为此，必须积极学习苏联先进经验，继续进行教学改革，发扬祖国医学遗产，切实团结中西医药人员，大力提高现有教师，培养新教师，努力发挥潜在力量，提高教学质量，以完成培养高级医药卫生干部的任务。
    会议经过认真学习苏联医学教育的先进经验和结合中国实际情况进行了缜密讨论后，确定了专业设置和明确了专业培养目标；制定了统一的教学计划，对于教学大纲的编写也作了原则的规定。此外，还讨论了培养和提高师资，开展科学研究工作，各院校培养干部的具体任务，医药院校的领导关系，全面地系统地学习苏联先进经验的具体内容，学习宝贵的祖国医学遗产，培养少数民族卫生干部以及迁校和新建校舍的原则等问题。应邀到会的中医师们也参加了讨论。
    到会代表还充分交流了数年来在改进医学教育方面的经验。　（新华社）
