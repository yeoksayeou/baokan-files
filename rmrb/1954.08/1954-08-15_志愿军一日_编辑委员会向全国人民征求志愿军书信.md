    "One Day of the Chinese People's Volunteers" Editorial Committee Solicits Letters from the Chinese People's Volunteers from People Across the Country

    During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers established extensive communication with the people of the motherland. In many letters written by commanders and fighters of the Volunteers to the people of the motherland, they not only truthfully reported the combat life of the Volunteers, but also overflowed with the lofty feelings of the people's soldiers. For the needs of the "One Day of the Chinese People's Volunteers" editorial work, we are specially soliciting letters from the Chinese People's Volunteers from people across the country. We hope that the families and relatives of the Volunteers, fellow workers, fellow farmers, young students, staff members of organizations, and compatriots across the country, all those who have had correspondence with the commanders and fighters of the Volunteers, please send us the letters from the Volunteers that you have preserved. If you are unwilling to send the original letter, you can send us a copy. This will be a great support for our "One Day of the Chinese People's Volunteers" editorial work. Please send letters to "No. 45, Dongrongxian Hutong, Beijing, 'One Day of the Chinese People's Volunteers' Editorial Committee".

    “志愿军一日”编辑委员会向全国人民征求志愿军书信
    中国人民志愿军在参加抗美援朝战争期间，曾与祖国人民建立了广泛的通讯联系，在许多志愿军指战员写给祖国人民的信件中，不仅真实地报告了志愿军的战斗生活，而且洋溢着人民战士的崇高感情。我们为了“志愿军一日”编辑工作需要，特向全国人民征求志愿军的书信。我们希望志愿军的家属、亲友们，工人同志们，农民同志们，青年学生们，机关工作人员们，全国同胞们，凡是曾和志愿军指战员有过通信联系的，请把你们所保存的志愿军来信寄给我们。如果不愿寄原信，可抄录一份寄来，这对我们“志愿军一日”的编辑工作将是一个极大的支持。来信请寄“北京东绒线胡同四十五号，志愿军一日编辑委员会”。
