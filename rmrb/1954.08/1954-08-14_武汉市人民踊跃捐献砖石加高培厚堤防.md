The broad masses of citizens, organs, troops, enterprises, and schools in Wuhan City are enthusiastically donating their accumulated stones and bricks to support the raising and thickening of the dikes, in order to strive for victory in the final stage of flood prevention. According to incomplete statistics from the Jiang'an, Jianghan, and Qiaokou districts of Hankou, nearly seven hundred cubic meters of stone and bricks have already been donated. Recently, every morning and evening, one can see trucks and carts loaded with bricks and stones passing through the city streets, transporting them to various sections of the dikes. For their own safety, the citizens are actively using baskets and sacks, or carrying them on their shoulders and in their hands, to send bricks and stones to the dikes.

The people of Wuhan regard donating bricks and stones and supporting flood prevention as the most glorious duty. In the Yongqing Street and Fenjin Street areas of Jiang'an District near Danshuichi, where the dike breached in 1931, more than 85 percent of the residents donated bricks and stones. In Jianghan District, 20 streets with 50,000 to 60,000 residents donated bricks and stones. The Jianghan District Seamen's Union also reported a donation of 200 tons of stones, to be taken as needed. Huang Yufeng and two other women, family members of porters in Yan Jiawan Street, picked up more than 800 jin of stones in two days. Many students in various districts who are on summer vacation are also actively participating in the brick and stone donation campaign. A resident named Chen Xiuzhen had a large bluestone at home, which someone once offered 200,000 to 300,000 yuan to buy, but her mother refused to sell; this time, upon hearing that it was needed for flood prevention, she donated it without hesitation.

    武汉市人民踊跃捐献砖石加高培厚堤防
    武汉市广大市民和机关、部队、企业、学校为了争取防汛最后阶段的胜利，都踊跃把自家积存的石料、砖头捐献出来，支援堤防的加高培厚工程。据汉口江岸、江汉、桥口三个区的不完全统计，现已捐献了将近七百立方公尺的石料和砖头。最近每天的早晨和傍晚，随时可以看到满载砖头石块的汽车和板车穿过市街，向各段堤防输送。市民们为了自身的安全，他们主动地用箩筐担、布袋背，或者肩扛、手捧，纷纷把砖石送到堤上。
    武汉市人民把捐献砖石、支援防汛视为最光荣的义务。一九三一年溃口的丹水池附近的江岸区永庆街、分金街一带，有百分之八十五以上的居民户都捐献了砖石。江汉区有二十条街五、六万居民户捐献砖石。江汉区海员工会也报捐二百吨石头，随用随取。严家湾街搬运工人家属黄玉凤等三个妇女，两天拣了八百多斤石头。各区许多正在度暑假的学生也积极参加了拣砖石的捐献运动。居民陈秀珍家里有一条大青石，过去有人出价二三十万元要买，她的母亲不肯卖；这回听说防汛需要，便毫不吝惜地捐了出来。　　　　　（据新华社讯）
