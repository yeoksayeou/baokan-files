State-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill

Over 8,000 Employees Earnestly Discuss the Draft Constitution

    The mass campaign of publicity and discussion of the draft constitution at the state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill began on July 9th and concluded at the end of July. Ninety-five percent of the mill’s more than 8,000 employees participated in the discussion of the draft constitution. The mill's employees were divided into more than 390 groups for two rounds of discussions, raising a total of 78 questions and suggestions for revision.

    For nearly a month, the mill has been filled with a joyful atmosphere. A huge red banner reading "All Employees of the Mill Actively, Extensively, and Deeply Carry Out the Publicity and Discussion of the Draft Constitution" hangs across the main road leading to the factory buildings. The blackboard newspaper, edited by the trade union, published a special issue on the discussion of the draft constitution. Despite the continuous rain for many days, people still held umbrellas to copy down relevant Q&As about the draft constitution in front of the blackboard newspaper. In discussion sessions and in conversations after work, workers could be seen everywhere, excitedly discussing this major event in political life.

    The state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill has been established for 34 years. For more than 20 years, the owner of the factory was Japanese imperialism. More than eight years ago, the factory was seized by the "Textile Construction Company" of the Kuomintang's four major families. Whether under the rule of Japanese imperialism or the Kuomintang reactionaries, the workers had no freedom at all. Speaking together in twos and threes would be monitored, and even lead to arrest, by Japanese devils and secret agents. The old workers, who had long suffered from oppression, felt particularly precious the democratic rights they enjoyed after liberation. In various meetings, they eloquently recounted the suffering they endured in the days without democracy and freedom, and rejoiced that they now lived in this happy era and could participate in the formulation of the nation's fundamental law.

    During the more than 20 days of discussion, the employees maintained a very serious attitude. All employees actively participated in the discussions. They discussed with particular enthusiasm Article 1 of the General Program of the Draft Constitution, "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants"; Article 2 of the General Program, "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people"; Article 16 of the General Program, "Labor is a glorious thing for all citizens of the People's Republic of China who have the ability to work. The state encourages citizens' initiative and creativity in labor"; the chapter on "Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens"; and various provisions for building socialism. The planning section group studied the text word by word and sentence by sentence during the discussions. In their discussions, they all expressed their heartfelt support for the draft constitution and earnestly and seriously put forward their suggestions for revision. The leadership of the state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill is currently compiling these opinions and will report them to the higher-level Draft Constitution Discussion Committee.

    This publicity and discussion campaign of the draft constitution, carried out on the basis of education on the general task of the state during the transition period, has further inspired the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of all employees. The technical innovation movement currently underway in the factory has gradually shown a new atmosphere these days. The number of rationalization proposals is increasing day by day. From July 1st to July 24th, the employees put forward 111 rationalization proposals in production, almost equal to the total number of rationalization proposals for the whole of last year. Now, the leadership of the state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill is further deepening the publicity of the draft constitution in order to correctly guide this high degree of political enthusiasm of the workers into daily labor and production.

    国营上海第十七棉纺织厂
    八千多职工认真讨论宪法草案
    国营上海第十七棉纺织厂群众性的宪法草案宣传讨论活动从七月九日开始，到七月底已经告一段落。全厂八千多职工中，有百分之九十五的人参加了宪法草案的讨论。全厂职工分成三百九十多个小组，进行了两次讨论，提出的疑问和修改意见共七十八条。
    近一个月来，厂里到处洋溢着一片欢乐的气氛。“全厂职工积极广泛深入地开展宪法草案的宣传讨论”的巨幅红色标语横挂在通向厂房的要道上。工会主编的黑板报出版了关于讨论宪法草案的专刊。许多天来都不断地下雨，仍然有人打着雨伞在黑板报前摘录有关宪法草案的问答。在讨论会上，在散工以后的谈话里，处处可以看到工人群众怀着激动的心情，谈论着政治生活中的这件大事。
    国营上海第十七棉纺织厂建厂已经三十四年了，有二十多年，工厂的主人是日本帝国主义，八年多以前，工厂又被国民党四大家族的“纺建公司”所劫收。不论在日本帝国主义或者国民党反动派统治时期，工人都没有丝毫自由，两三个人在一起讲话，都会遭到日本鬼子和特务们的监视，甚至逮捕。长期遭受压迫的老工人们，对解放以后享受到的民主权利感到特别可贵，他们在各种会议上，滔滔不绝地诉说着过去没有民主和自由的日子所受的痛苦，庆幸自己现在生活在这个幸福的年代，能够参加国家根本大法的制定工作。
    在二十多天的讨论过程中，职工群众一直抱着很严肃的态度。全厂职工都积极地参加讨论。他们对宪法草案总纲第一条“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家”、总纲第二条中“中华人民共和国一切权力属于人民”、总纲第十六条“劳动是中华人民共和国一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣事情。国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性”和“公民的基本权利和义务”
  一章，以及建设社会主义的各种规定，讨论得特别热烈。计划科小组在讨论中逐句逐字进行研究。他们在讨论中，都衷心地表示了拥护宪法草案的意见，他们认真地严肃地提出了自己的修改意见。国营上海第十七棉纺织厂的领导上，正在整理这些意见，并将汇报上级宪法草案讨论委员会。
    在国家过渡时期总任务教育的基础上所开展的这一宪法草案宣传和讨论活动，进一步鼓舞了全体职工的政治热情和劳动热情。正在厂内开展的技术革新运动，这些日子逐渐出现了新气象，合理化建议一天比一天增多，从七月一日计算到七月二十四日止，职工在生产中提出的合理化建议有一百十一件，几乎等于去年全年合理化建议的数目。现在，国营上海第十七棉纺织厂领导上正在进一步深入宣传宪法草案，以便把工人群众这种高度的政治热情，正确地引导到日常的劳动生产中去。
