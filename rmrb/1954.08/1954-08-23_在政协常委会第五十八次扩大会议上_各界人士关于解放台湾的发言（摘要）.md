Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: At the 58th Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Li Jishen and others made speeches and submitted written opinions on the issue of liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Excerpts of their speeches and written opinions are as follows:

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said, "We must solemnly declare to the world: Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. This is the determination and strength of our people nationwide. The joint declaration to be adopted at this meeting puts forward the tasks that must be completed in all aspects to liberate Taiwan. I think all of this is very correct. We are willing to work with the people of the whole country to complete this task."

Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said, "To safeguard the security of our motherland and the integrity of our territorial sovereignty, and to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, we must liberate Taiwan. Every Chinese must wholeheartedly and unitedly take on this great task. At the same time, we must unite all international friends in Asia and the world who sympathize with our just cause, and win over all those who are willing to abandon darkness and turn to the light, so that our great and just liberation cause can achieve complete victory."

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said, "Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times. Elderly people today can still remember the tragic history of Japan's occupation of Taiwan in 1895. At that time, we all expressed great indignation at the humiliation suffered by the country. Today, nearly sixty years later, the powerful Chinese people will never allow the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to continue to occupy Taiwan under the protection of the United States and commit evil. Every Chinese, young and old, male and female, will actively agree with and support the liberation of Taiwan."

Guo Moruo, a non-party democratic figure of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said, "The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a struggle to defend world peace. Only by eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the source of evil under the protection of American aggressors, can peace in Asia and the world be spared from threats. The joint declaration to be adopted soon demonstrates the firm and unwavering common will of our people. The call in the declaration for the people of China to unite more strongly is an important condition for completing the great cause of liberating Taiwan. I hope that all our democratic parties, all our fraternal nationalities, and the people of the whole country will unite more closely, exert collective strength, Taiwan must be liberated, and it will certainly be liberated."

Liu Wenhui, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said, "We have sufficient strength and confidence to complete the sacred cause of liberating Taiwan. The days of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are numbered, and the heinous traitor Chiang Kai-shek will not escape the people's justice. The joint declaration that we are about to adopt is the victorious march for the liberation of Taiwan. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country must advance towards the victory of the sacred cause of liberating Taiwan."

Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said, "The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, in collusion with the American aggressors, has carried out harassment activities on our coastal areas and on the high seas, disrupting peace in Asia and the world. We must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the scourge caused by this group of pirates, just like cutting open a boil to remove the pus. We must eliminate the boil of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique."

Lu Han, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said, "The liberation of Taiwan is the common and unanimous determination of the people of the whole country, and every Chinese is willing to strive to complete this task. We must actively respond to the call of the great motherland, take active action, strengthen our work in all aspects, and strive for the liberation of Taiwan, the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and the defense of the motherland's security and world peace. At the same time, I also hope that all those who followed the Chiang Kai-shek traitor to Taiwan can abandon darkness and turn to the light, perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, and the people of the motherland will be lenient."

Huang Zhengqing, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Administrative Committee, spoke about the political, economic, and cultural achievements of all minority nationalities since the founding of the People's Republic of China. He said, "To realize the complete unification of the great motherland, and to ensure our long-term happy and peaceful days, we must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. This is directly related to the vital interests of the people of all minority nationalities. Therefore, we must respond to the call of the Central People's Government to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang with practical actions to develop production and strengthen national unity."

Peng Zemin, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said, "The joint declaration that we are about to adopt is a great declaration, a letter expressing the determination of 600 million Chinese people. The people of the whole country will be mobilized to liberate the territory of Taiwan, and peace-loving people all over the world will surely be inspired and support our just action. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have full confidence in achieving the final victory of liberating Taiwan; but we must not sit and wait for victory, we must strengthen our work in all aspects and strive for the early arrival of victory."

Chen Shaokuan, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said, "The liberation of Taiwan is the will of the people of the whole country, especially the urgent demand of the people of Fujian. The people of Fujian have suffered the most from the harassment and infringement of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and therefore their resentment is particularly deep. Recently, at the Fujian Provincial People's Congress, all the representatives unanimously expressed their determination to work hard to increase production and fully support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and all coastal islands. The people of Taiwan have suffered greatly from the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek traitors, and they hate Chiang Kai-shek to the bone. I firmly believe that the people of Taiwan will carry forward the traditional revolutionary spirit, accumulate strength, and welcome and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan."

Li Chunqing, Vice Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, first paid tribute and thanked the brothers and sisters on the mainland on behalf of the eight million compatriots in distress in Taiwan. Then he narrated the history of the Taiwan compatriots being brutally oppressed and massacred by Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. He said: "Taiwan is now a large prison imprisoning eight million people. The people of Taiwan, regardless of men, women, old or young, are living the lives of prisoners; however, the people of Taiwan are not surrendering, they are the sons and daughters of the great Chinese nation, they are the descendants of the national hero Zheng Chenggong and his comrades. They are fighting bravely, they hope that the motherland will liberate Taiwan, and they thank the people of the motherland for their determination to liberate Taiwan. On behalf of the people of Taiwan, I swear: The people of Taiwan must unite and prepare for battle! When the People's Liberation Army crosses the Taiwan Strait, the five-star red flag will be raised inside Taiwan. The people of Taiwan will fight side by side with the people of the motherland to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and liberate Taiwan to the end!"

Fu Zuoyi, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said, "The liberation of Taiwan is a just action, a common call from the hearts of 600 million people across the country, including the people of Taiwan. We do not occupy the territory of other countries, but we will never allow other countries to occupy our territory; we do not infringe on the sovereignty of other countries, but we will never allow other countries to infringe on our sovereignty. This is the minimum requirement of an independent country. If American imperialism dares to interfere in our country's internal affairs, it will become an isolated sinner that is intolerable to world justice."

Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said, "The workers across the country, like the people of the whole country, feel extremely indignant and hateful when they hear about the despicable and shameless Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique occupying Taiwan and the American aggressor group occupying our territory. Chiang Kai-shek has plunged the Taiwan compatriots and workers into a deep abyss of suffering. The people of the whole country absolutely cannot allow this situation to continue. In order to liberate Taiwan, the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country must unite more firmly around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to fully support the sacred historical task of liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique!"

Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said, "The joint declaration represents the common will and aspiration of 600 million Chinese people. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and we will never allow the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to continue to occupy it and engage in activities that betray the country and harm the people. 'Traitorous officials and rebellious sons, everyone has the right to punish them.' The people of China will unanimously punish Chiang Kai-shek, this traitorous official and rebellious son, and liberate Taiwan from the hands of the American aggressors. We believe that the Chinese people, who defeated Japanese imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek, will surely be able to victoriously eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and recover our sacred territory of Taiwan."

Tang Shengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Consultative Committee, said, "The land of Taiwan was cultivated and built up by the hard work and bloody struggle of the Taiwan people. The same blood flows in the bodies of the Taiwan people as in ours, and the hearts of the Taiwan people, like ours, are filled with a natural feeling of love for the motherland. The Taiwan people do not want to be slaves of Japanese imperialism, and they will never be slaves of American imperialism. The Taiwan people are looking forward to the red flag of the motherland being planted on the beautiful Flower Island day and night, and they are constantly expecting the arrival of their relatives from the motherland. It is very wise, timely, and correct for us to issue this righteous declaration to the world, expressing the common will of our 600 million people."

Deng Baoshan, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, pointed out in his speech: The people of all ethnic groups in Gansu Province warmly support the call of the Central People's Government to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. He said: "The publication of the joint declaration will further stimulate the patriotic enthusiasm and fighting spirit of the broad masses of people in Gansu Province against the American aggressors and the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The people of Gansu Province will definitely strengthen their work in all aspects and strive to complete the sacred cause of the Chinese people liberating Taiwan."

Pei Changhui, a member of the Southwest Administrative Committee, said, "The liberation of Taiwan is a matter for the Chinese people themselves, and no foreign country has the right to interfere. We are determined to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and complete the struggle for our great liberation cause, which cannot be stopped by any foreign aggressor. Now the people of the whole country regard participating in the struggle to liberate Taiwan as their glorious task; the Taiwan compatriots, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, will also surely accumulate strength and prepare to launch a heroic struggle. The fighting force forged by 600 million Chinese people with patriotic ideology will surely be able to liberate Taiwan victoriously and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique."

Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, said, "The liberation of Taiwan is our country's internal affair, and no country has the right to interfere. As for the absurd proposition that Taiwan should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations, we Chinese people firmly oppose it. Our great motherland, under the leadership of the great, correct, and glorious Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao, has become even stronger. As long as we unite as one and work together, we will surely be able to achieve victory."

Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, expressed the wishes and will of women across the country to support the liberation of Taiwan in her speech. She said, "For our socialist peaceful construction, and to ensure the happy life of women and children in the new China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the women of the whole country will definitely strengthen unity with compatriots across the country, heighten vigilance, increase production, practice strict economy, and make greater efforts to overfulfill the national construction plan and support the just struggle to liberate Taiwan."

Shen Yanbing, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said, "The liberation of Taiwan and the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the sacred historical task of the Chinese people. The people of the world also clearly recognize that our liberation of Taiwan is an exercise of our country's sovereignty and is our country's internal affair. Justice is on our side, and the sympathy and support of the whole world is on our side. Our literary and art workers across the country must do their work more and better in their respective positions to cooperate with the united action of the people of the whole country to liberate Taiwan."

Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said, "After this declaration is published, it will definitely receive a warm response from workers across the country. Just like in the struggle against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, our workers across the country, both men and women, resolutely guarantee that in order to liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan, we will resolutely complete all the tasks assigned to us by the country, providing manpower and resources, ensuring the military and civilian needs of the front and the rear, and we will never stop until the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is eliminated."

Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "The liberation of Taiwan and the complete elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the common aspiration of every Chinese. This aspiration is firm and unwavering. Although American imperialism is now supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to occupy Taiwan, it is very weak. The ancient saying 'advancing and retreating are both difficult' is precisely the predicament of the current American aggressors. As long as we guard against arrogance and rashness, strengthen vigilance, and unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have full confidence in completing our sacred cause of liberating Taiwan."

Zhang Nanxian, Vice Chairman of the Central South Administrative Committee, said, "The liberation of Taiwan is a matter of course. Since the liberation of the mainland and Hainan Island, the people of Taiwan have been looking forward to being liberated from the deep abyss of suffering every day. It is very timely and necessary for us to put forward the slogan of liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique now. After this joint declaration is adopted and published, the people of the whole country must take active action and strive to respond to the call made in this declaration."

Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said, "The liberation of Taiwan is the sacred task of 600 million people across the country, and we will never stop until the goal is achieved. This is our firm position. Taiwan became Chinese territory earlier than Columbus discovered America. The Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation also stipulated that Taiwan should be returned to China. These are all facts, that is, the truth. The thief Chiang Kai-shek ruled China for more than 20 years, bringing disaster to the country and harming the people, committing all kinds of evil. Now he has fled to Taiwan to continue to betray the country. The people of the whole country want to kill him and be satisfied. Therefore, the liberation of Taiwan is the common demand of the people of the whole country and the compatriots in Taiwan. People from all walks of life in the country should strengthen their confidence, heighten their vigilance, and strive unremittingly to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan."

Li Weihan, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, emphasized in his speech the importance of closer unity among all democratic classes, democratic parties, and ethnic groups in the struggle to liberate Taiwan. The joint declaration to be adopted should be widely and deeply conveyed through the democratic parties, people's organizations, and local consultative bodies. He also pointed out that there should be a high degree of vigilance against various counter-revolutionary conspiracies and sabotage activities.

Ulanhu, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said, "The liberation of Taiwan is the common aspiration and urgent demand of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, and it is also a legitimate action to defend our territorial integrity and sovereignty. The people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region express unparalleled indignation at the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and the American aggressors who threaten our country's security, infringe upon China's sovereignty, and undermine China's territorial integrity by occupying Taiwan. He said that the people of Inner Mongolia should unite more closely with the people of the whole country, heighten their vigilance, do a good job in social security, consolidate the rear of the motherland, and at the same time, increase industrial, agricultural, and livestock production, practice strict economy, and ensure that there is grain for grain and people for people, and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan."

Li Mingyang, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said, "Since the liberation of our mainland five years ago, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, various construction undertakings have been advancing by leaps and bounds, and the people's lives have been improving day by day. The people of all ethnic groups across the country have united into a harmonious and happy big family; only the eight million compatriots in Taiwan are still under the devastation and oppression of the Chiang bandit gang and American imperialism, living a life worse than that of cattle and horses. If we do not liberate Taiwan, we will not only be sorry for our ancestors, but also for our descendants. Therefore, the liberation of Taiwan is the most important political task of the people of the whole country at present."

Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, said, "The liberation of Taiwan is a serious struggle, but we clearly know that any great victory is achieved through serious struggle. At the same time, our determination to liberate Taiwan is also irreversible and forward-looking. All our Youth League members and young people across the country will definitely intensify their work, production, and study with a hundredfold spirit, especially to heighten their vigilance and fight against all counter-revolutionary elements, and strive to liberate Taiwan and finally, completely, and cleanly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique."

Sheng Pi Hua, Chairman of Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, said, "The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is a small group of traitors, Chiang bandit Kai-shek is the public enemy of 600 million people of China. We cannot tolerate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group colluding with the American aggressors to occupy Taiwan as a base to disturb our coastal area. The Shanghai people will not forget the bombing of our coastal cities and the shooting of fishermen by the Chiang bandit gang. We industrialists and businessmen, like the people all over the country, like the people in southeast coastal areas, are willing to contribute all our strength to the glorious cause of liberating Taiwan. We must do our work well, guarantee to love the country and abide by the law, actively operate, work hard to produce, accept transformation, respond to the call of the motherland, and wage a resolute struggle to liberate Taiwan."

Bao Dasan, Vice Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Consultative Committee, said, "Our Zhejiang is located on the front line of the struggle to liberate Taiwan. For five years, it has been constantly subjected to harassment and sabotage by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group that uses Taiwan as its nest. The more than 20 million people in Zhejiang welcome the historical task of liberating Taiwan with incomparable excitement. The liberation of Taiwan is a struggle, which includes military struggle - which is the main one, but also diplomatic, political, economic, and propaganda struggles. Our struggle will be invincible if all aspects work together. The people of Zhejiang must heighten their vigilance, pay close attention at all times, and prevent and eliminate hidden and newly sent US-Chiang agents."

Sun Lanfeng, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Consultative Committee, pointed out in his speech: "The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's acts of betraying the motherland and massacring the people before being driven out of the mainland of China and after fleeing to Taiwan are unforgivable and intolerable to the people of our country. He said: "The people of our country must unite more closely, give full play to the spirit of patriotism, work hard a hundredfold, contribute all our strength, and we have full confidence and determination to complete this glorious and sacred cause of liberating Taiwan."

Qiu Jin, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, expressed the full support of all Chinese seamen, dockworkers, and workers in all water transport enterprises for the joint declaration on the liberation of Taiwan on behalf of the entire Chinese seamen. He then accused the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique of robbing merchant ships and fishing boats and massacring seamen and fishermen in a piratical manner under the instructions and protection of the American fleet. He said that the entire Chinese seamen, as well as the dockworkers, shipyard workers, and all brothers of waterway transportation, must unite more closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, inherit the glorious experience of supporting the liberation of Hainan Island, Zhoushan Islands and other battles, prepare in all aspects, better complete the national economic transportation and national defense transportation tasks, and strive to support the liberation of Taiwan to the end!

Guan Ruolan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, said, "Our students deeply understand the suffering of Taiwan compatriots and students. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is now coercing Taiwan young students and farmers to act as cannon fodder. In July of this year, more than 32,000 Taiwan students have been forced to participate in "summer youth combat training," and many male and female students have been forced to be incorporated into the bandit army on Jinmen Island and other places. Young students who oppose forced enlistment are being arrested and massacred. This crazy action of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has turned Taiwan into a terror camp. Our students cannot tolerate the evil actions of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitor. Our blood is boiling, and we swear to the motherland that we must study harder, exercise our bodies, respond to Chairman Mao's call at all times, and fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan."

Pan Shu, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, said, "We must not allow the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to steal Taiwan as a nest for treasonous and traitorous activities. One day Taiwan is not liberated, the people of the whole country cannot sleep peacefully for one day, and the eight million compatriots in Taiwan are deeply mired in dire straits. How can we be worthy of them if we do not extend a helping hand to them? Moreover, if Taiwan is not liberated, it is also a serious source of trouble for peace in Asia and the world. This joint declaration is righteous and represents the will of the Chinese people. Truth and justice are on our side, and victory belongs to us. On behalf of the Nanjing Municipal Consultative Committee and the local organizations of various democratic parties, I express my determination to devote all efforts to implement the historical task of liberating Taiwan as pointed out in this declaration."

Tang Guifen, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, first stated in her speech that on behalf of 1.4 million male and female workers in Shanghai, she was willing to fight to the end to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan. She said that Shanghai is located on the front line of the struggle to liberate Taiwan. The Shanghai workers guarantee to the people of the whole country that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, they will unite more closely with the workers and people of the whole country, carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Shanghai workers, work hard to increase production, practice strict economy, promote labor emulation campaigns, actively participate in the technical innovation movement, improve and consolidate labor discipline, complete and overfulfill the national production plan, accelerate the country's socialist industrialization and national defense modernization, and participate in and support the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Taiwan with the heroic spirit of welcoming the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Shanghai and supporting the battle to liberate the Zhoushan Islands.

Rong Yiren, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, said, "In order to respond to the great call to liberate Taiwan, Shanghai's industrialists and businessmen will firmly be with the people of the whole country, unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, sincerely accept socialist transformation, study hard, obey the national plan, actively operate, heighten their vigilance, strictly prevent special agents from spreading rumors and sabotage, and contribute manpower, materials, and financial resources to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. We also hope that the industrialists and businessmen who went to Taiwan in the past due to false rumors from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang should wake up in time, enthusiastically respond to the call of the motherland, actively prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army, return to their hometowns, and participate in the great construction cause of the motherland."

Hu Ziang, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Consultative Committee, said, "I am from Chongqing and know deeply the Chongqing people's hatred of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Before the liberation of Chongqing, all the inhuman atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime looting people's property, destroying public construction, and massacring revolutionary martyrs were deeply imprinted in the hearts of everyone in Chongqing. The people of Chongqing, like the people of the whole country, feel extremely excited about the sacred call to liberate Taiwan. The people of Chongqing, based on their personal suffering, extend deep sympathy to the Taiwan compatriots who are being persecuted today, and are willing to fight to the end to support the liberation of Taiwan."

Chen Jingshe, Chairman of the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce, said, "The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has exhausted its conscience, recognized thieves as fathers, and dared to carry out harassment and sabotage activities in our southeastern coastal areas and islands under the instigation of American imperialism, robbing our motherland's merchant ships and ships of various countries that trade with our country, and massacring our compatriots. These crimes are truly too numerous to record and cannot be tolerated by the people of the whole country. Our industrial and commercial circles must strengthen unity with the people of the whole country, strive to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan in order to restore our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Ning Wu, convener of the Northeast Provisional Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, stated in his speech that the people of Liaoning Province would work with the people of the whole country to work hard to increase production, consolidate national defense, strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, continue to give play to the spirit of patriotism in all work posts, and contribute their strength to respond to the great call to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

Chen Rutang, Director of the South China Provisional Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said, "The call to liberate Taiwan has made the more than 30 million people in Guangdong Province feel infinitely happy and encouraged. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group constantly invades our coastal areas, and Guangdong Province is one of the first to bear the brunt. The people of Guangdong have suffered from these threats and always hope to liberate our country's sacred territory of Taiwan as soon as possible, so that Taiwan compatriots can return to the embrace of the motherland's freedom and happiness, and our production and construction can be guaranteed peace. All the people in Guangdong Province will support and support the joint declaration, and are stepping up preparations for the liberation of Taiwan."

Bi Mingqi, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, said, "Taiwan, in the past, today, and in the future, is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The compatriots in Taiwan, under the exploitation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, have lost all freedom. The liberation of Taiwan is the urgent demand of the Taiwan compatriots that they look forward to day and night, and it is also the unanimous desire of the people of the whole country. The industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin must resolutely support the liberation of Taiwan, and must study Premier Zhou's diplomatic report, and take the liberation of Taiwan as the specific content of the patriotic education of the industrialists and businessmen, so as to love the country and abide by the law, and carry out sharp struggles against lawbreakers and counter-revolutionaries."

Liang Shuming, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said, "I support Premier Zhou's diplomatic report and the decision passed by the Central People's Government Committee when it approved the diplomatic report of Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai on calling on the people of the whole country and the Chinese People's Liberation Army to strengthen their work in all aspects and strive to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, and finally complete the sacred liberation cause of our people. I also support the joint declaration to be adopted at this meeting, and I am willing to respond to the call of the joint declaration, follow everyone, and do my part to liberate Taiwan. I think it is very necessary to call on the people of the whole country to unite more closely in the joint declaration."

Li Weiguang, head of the Nanjing Diocese of the Catholic Church, said, "I am the representative of the Nanjing Diocese of the Catholic Church. American imperialism once used Catholicism as a tool to invade China. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group also used Catholicism as a tool for counter-revolution; however, the Chinese Catholic believers love the motherland and love peace. We will never allow American imperialism to occupy Taiwan, and we will never allow the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to continue to occupy Taiwan. We want to contribute all our strength to liberate Taiwan together with the people of the whole country. We also hope that the Catholic believers in Taiwan will not be used by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, and enjoy freedom of religious belief and a peaceful and happy life."

Chen Mengyuan, Vice Chairman of the Qingdao Federation of Industry and Commerce, said, "Decades of personal experience have made me deeply feel the darkness of the old society; the achievements of national construction in the past five years have made me more convinced of the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party. Now the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is still occupying Taiwan, and the Taiwan compatriots are still living in darkness. We cannot but rescue them. "People have the same heart, and hearts have the same reason." Liberating Taiwan is an obligation that any patriotic citizen should assume. Qingdao is an important coastal area of our country, and we Qingdao people must strive to overfulfill the national construction plan, support the liberation of Taiwan, and also heighten our vigilance and strive to support the People's Liberation Army in defending the national sea defense."

Lu Guangji, Vice Chairman of the Shenyang Federation of Industry and Commerce, said, "One day the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang occupies Taiwan, the people of our mainland will not have true peace for one day; if Taiwan is not liberated, the national liberation cause cannot be considered complete. On behalf of the industrialists and businessmen in Shenyang, I firmly support the just call for the liberation of Taiwan. After I return to my local area, I will carry out extensive publicity to make every industrialist and businessman fully realize the great significance of liberating Taiwan and the tasks they should undertake; and I will also mobilize the industrialists and businessmen in the city to further love the country and abide by the law, accept socialist transformation, and use such practical actions to support the liberation of Taiwan."

Wu Han, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, said, "Our youth across the country, together with the people of the whole country, will never tolerate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group turning Taiwan into a nest of traitors, and will never tolerate the American aggressor group occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan and using Taiwan as a base to carry out aggression against China, infringe on China's sovereignty, and undermine peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese youth vow to do everything in their power to intensify production, work hard to study, do their work well in their respective posts, complete and overfulfill the tasks given by the country, and fight for the liberation of Taiwan, opposition to American interference, protection of national security, and defense of world peace."

Ma Jian, a member of the China Islamic Association, said, "The liberation of Taiwan and the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to complete the liberation cause of our people is the common aspiration and unanimous demand of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. The people of the ten ethnic minorities who believe in Islam and the people of the rest of the ethnic minorities will unite more strongly with the people of the whole country and strive for the liberation of Taiwan under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao."

Han Wangchen, Chairman of the Shaanxi Federation of Industry and Commerce, condemned in his speech the crimes of the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group in stealing Taiwan. On behalf of the industrial and commercial circles of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City, he firmly supported this correct and timely measure to liberate Taiwan. He said that at the first session of the First People's Congress of Shaanxi Province, the representatives of the industrial and commercial circles firmly stated that they vowed to support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions such as loving the country and abiding by the law, actively operating, obeying the leadership of the state-owned economy, accepting socialist transformation, and actively paying taxes; and asked the representatives elected to the National People's Congress to bring this firm will to the meeting of the National People's Congress.

Qiao Chuanjue, Vice Chairman of the Lüda Municipal Consultative Committee, said, "Before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the people of Lüda, who had the same experience as the compatriots in Taiwan, felt particularly empathetic towards the extremely painful slave life of the Taiwan compatriots for nearly 60 years. Lüda is a coastal industrial city and a key area for national defense. We deeply feel that in the struggle to liberate Taiwan, we also shoulder important responsibilities. The people of Lüda will unite more closely into a strong team, maintain a high degree of vigilance, consolidate the coastal defense of the motherland, prevent any enemy harassment and sabotage, and increase production, practice strict economy, improve the level of industrial and agricultural production and various tasks, and strive to complete and overfulfill the national construction plan to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan."

Wang Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the Jinan Municipal Consultative Committee, said, "The United States vainly attempts to interfere in the sacred cause of our people to liberate Taiwan, but its failure in the Korean War proves that the so-called strength is not to be feared. Of course, we must also heighten our vigilance and not be proud. Shandong is located on the front line of coastal defense. The people of Shandong Province and the organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Jinan City were all overjoyed when they heard that Taiwan was to be liberated. We must assume the responsibilities that we should bear in the great task of liberating Taiwan like the people of the whole country."

Hou Debang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies, said, "We will never allow the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which betrayed the motherland, to occupy any part of the motherland's territory, and we will never allow this bandit gang to collude with foreign forces to betray the motherland. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the American aggressors are creating trouble in our home, hindering us from carrying out peaceful construction, and undermining peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, the liberation of Taiwan is our sacred task. Scientific workers across the country must unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government, work hard to study science, and improve the level of scientific theory, so that science can serve the socialist industrialization of the new China and the sacred cause of liberating Taiwan."

Wang Baozhen, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Consultative Committee, expressed the deep desire of the 36 million people of Hebei Province to liberate Taiwan with many vivid examples in his speech. He said with full confidence that we believe that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and with the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country

    在政协常委会第五十八次扩大会议上
    各界人士关于解放台湾的发言（摘要）
    【新华社二十二日讯】在中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会第五十八次扩大会议上，李济深等就解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的问题发言和提出了书面意见，他们的发言和书面意见摘要如下：
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深说，我们要严正地向全世界宣告：台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。这是我们全国人民的决心和力量。这次会议所要通过的联合宣言向全国人民提出了为解放台湾而必须在各方面努力完成的任务。我认为这一切都是非常对的。我们愿意和全国人民共同来完成这个任务。
    中国民主同盟副主席章伯钧说，为了保障我们祖国的安全和领土主权的完整，为了保障亚洲及世界和平，我们一定要解放台湾。每一个中国人都要全心全力地、团结一致地把这个伟大的任务承担起来。同时，我们还要团结亚洲和全世界一切同情我们这一正义事业的国际友人，争取一切愿意弃暗投明的人们，以使我们伟大的正义的解放事业取得完全胜利。
    中国民主建国会总会主任委员黄炎培说，台湾自古就是中国的领土，现在年老的人，都会记得一八九五年日本侵占台湾的惨痛历史。那时我们对于国家所蒙受的这种奇耻大辱，都表示非常愤慨。在近六十年后的今天，已经强大起来的中国人民，决不容许蒋介石卖国集团在美国庇护下继续盘踞台湾，为非作恶。每一个中国人，无论老少男女，对于解放台湾这件事，都会积极赞同和支持的。
    中国人民政协无党派民主人士郭沫若说，中国人民解放台湾的斗争就是保卫世界和平的斗争，只有消灭了在美国侵略者庇护下的蒋介石卖国集团这个祸害的根源，亚洲及世界和平才能免于遭受威胁。即将通过的联合宣言显示了我国人民坚定不移的共同意志。宣言所号召的全中国人民更加坚强的团结，是完成解放台湾大业的重要条件。我希望我们所有民主党派、各兄弟民族和全国人民都更加紧密地团结，发挥集体力量，台湾一定要解放，也一定会解放的。
    中国人民政协全国委员会委员刘文辉说，我们有足够的力量和信心来完成解放台湾的神圣事业。蒋介石卖国集团灭亡的日子就在眼前了，罪大恶极的卖国贼蒋介石是难逃人民法网的。这次我们所要通过的联合宣言就是解放台湾的胜利的进行曲。我们全国人民一定要在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，向着解放台湾这一神圣事业的胜利前进。
    中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊说，蒋介石卖国集团勾结美国侵略者在我国沿海和公海上所作的骚扰活动，破坏了亚洲及世界的和平，我们一定要解放台湾，消灭这伙海盗所造成的祸害，正如开刀把脓包去掉一样，我们要把蒋介石卖国集团这个脓包消灭掉。
    中国人民政协全国委员会委员卢汉说，解放台湾是全国人民共同一致的决心，每一个中国人民都愿为完成这个任务而奋斗。我们要积极响应伟大祖国的召唤，积极行动起来，从各方面加强工作，为解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，保卫祖国安全和世界和平而努力。同时，我也希望一切跟随蒋介石卖国贼逃到台湾去的人，能够弃暗投明、立功赎罪，祖国人民是会宽大的。（上接第一版）
    西北行政委员会副主席黄正清在发言中谈到中华人民共和国成立以来，各少数民族在政治上、经济上、文化上的成就。他说，为了实现伟大祖国的完全统一，为了保障我们长远的幸福的和平的日子，我们必须解放台湾，消灭蒋介石匪帮，这是直接关系着各少数民族人民的切身利益的。因此，我们一定要以发展生产、加强民族团结的实际行动，响应中央人民政府解放台湾、消灭蒋介石匪帮的号召。
    中国农工民主党副主席彭泽民说，我们即将通过的联合宣言是一个伟大的宣言，是一个表达六万万中国人民的决心书。全国人民将为解放祖国的领土台湾而动员起来，全世界爱好和平的人民，也必将闻声振奋，同情和支持我们的正义行动。在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，我们完全有信心获得解放台湾的最后胜利；但是我们决不能坐待胜利，必须从各方面加强工作，争取胜利的早日到来。
    中国人民政协全国委员会委员陈绍宽说，解放台湾是我们全国人民的意志，特别是我们福建人民的迫切要求。福建人民遭受蒋介石卖国集团的骚扰、侵害特多，因此愤恨特深。最近在福建省人民代表大会会议上，全体代表一致表示要努力增加生产，全力支援中国人民解放军解放台湾和沿海一切岛屿。台湾人民备受蒋介石卖国贼的压迫，对蒋贼已恨之入骨，我深信台湾人民一定会发扬传统的革命精神，积蓄力量，迎接和配合人民解放军解放台湾的。
    台湾民主自治同盟副主席李纯青在发言中首先代表在苦难中的八百万台湾同胞向在大陆的兄弟姊妹致敬和致谢。接着他叙述了台湾同胞惨遭日本帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮压迫和屠杀的历史。他说：台湾现在已经是一座监禁着八百万人民的大监狱，台湾人民无论男女老少，都在过着囚犯的生活；但是，台湾人民是不屈服的，他们是伟大的中国民族的儿女，他们是民族英雄郑成功和他的战友们的后代，他们在勇敢战斗，他们希望祖国解放台湾，感谢祖国人民决心解放台湾。我代表台湾人民宣誓：台湾人民一定团结起来，准备战斗！在人民解放军横渡台湾海峡的时候，五星红旗将在台湾内部升起。台湾人民将和祖国人民一道，为消灭蒋介石卖国集团，解放台湾而奋斗到底！
    中国人民政协全国委员会委员傅作义说，解放台湾是正义的行动，是全国六亿人民，包括台湾人民心里的共同的呼声。我们不侵占别国的领土，但也决不容许别国侵占我国的领土；我们不侵犯别国的主权，但也决不容许别国侵犯我们的主权。这是一个独立国家起码的要求。美帝国主义如果敢于干涉我国的内政，他将成为世界正义所不容的孤立的罪人。
    中华全国总工会副主席朱学范说，全国工人群众和全国人民一样，一提起卑鄙无耻的蒋介石卖国集团盘踞台湾，美国侵略集团侵占我国领土的时候，就万分愤慨和痛恨。蒋介石使台湾同胞和工人群众陷于水深火热的痛苦深渊中，这种情况，我们全国人民绝对不能让它继续下去了。为了解放台湾，中国工人阶级和全国人民一定要更坚强地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，百倍提高警惕，增加生产，厉行节约，为全力支援解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团这一神圣的历史任务而奋斗！
    九三学社主席许德珩说，联合宣言代表了六万万中国人民的共同意志和愿望。台湾是中国的领土，绝不容许卖国贼蒋介石继续盘踞，作出卖祖国危害人民的勾当。“乱臣贼子，人人得而诛之。”全中国人民将万众一心地诛戮蒋介石这个乱臣贼子，从美国侵略者手里解放台湾。我们相信：打败了日本帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石的中国人民，必然能够胜利地消灭蒋介石卖国集团，收复我们神圣的领土台湾。
    湖南省协商委员会副主席唐生智说，台湾的土地是台湾人民的血汗劳动和鲜血斗争开垦建设起来的。台湾人民身上同我们流着一样的血液，台湾人民心里同我们一样充满着热爱祖国的天然感情。台湾人民不做日本帝国主义的奴隶，也绝不做美帝国主义的奴隶，台湾人民日日夜夜盼望着祖国的红旗插在美丽的花岛上，时时刻刻期待着祖国亲人的到来。我们向全世界发表这个正义的宣言，表示我国六万万人民的共同意志，是非常英明的，及时的，正确的。
    中国人民政协全国委员会委员邓宝珊在发言中指出：甘肃省各族各界人民热烈拥护中央人民政府提出的解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团的号召。他说：联合宣言的发表必将进一步激发甘肃省广大人民反对美国侵略者和消灭蒋介石卖国集团的爱国热情和战斗精神。甘肃省人民一定将加强各方面的工作，为完成我国人民解放台湾的神圣事业而奋斗。
    西南行政委员会委员裴昌会说，解放台湾是中国人民自己的事，任何外国都无权过问。我们坚决要消灭负隅的蒋介石卖国集团，完成我国伟大解放事业的斗争，这是任何外国侵略者阻挡不住的。现在全国人民都把参加解放台湾的斗争，视为自己的光荣任务；富有光荣革命传统的台湾同胞，也必将积蓄力量，准备展开英勇的斗争。六万万中国人民为爱国主义思想所熔铸成的战斗力量，一定能够胜利地解放台湾，一定能够把蒋介石卖国集团彻底消灭。
    中国致公党主席陈其尤说，解放台湾是我国的内政，任何国家都没有权利来干涉。至于所谓台湾交由联合国托管的这种荒谬主张，我们中国人民坚决反对。我们伟大的祖国在伟大的、正确的、光荣的中国共产党和英明的领袖毛主席的领导下，已更加强大了，只要我们团结一致，共同努力，我们就一定能取得胜利。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全在发言中表达了全国妇女拥护解放台湾的心愿和意志。她说，为了我们社会主义的和平建设，为了保障新中国妇女和儿童在中国共产党和毛主席领导下所获得的幸福生活，全中国的妇女一定和全中国同胞一道加强团结，提高警惕，增加生产，厉行节约，为超额完成国家建设计划，支援解放台湾的正义斗争而付出更大的努力。
    中国文学艺术界联合会副主席沈雁冰说，解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，是中国人民神圣的历史任务。世界人民也清楚地认识到，我们解放台湾是行使我国的主权，是我国的内政。正义在我们方面，全世界的同情和支持是在我们方面。我们全国文艺工作者一定要在自己的工作岗位上，把工作做得更多更好，来配合全国人民解放台湾的一致行动。
    中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一说，这个宣言公布后，一定会得到全国职工的热烈响应。像在抗美援朝的斗争中一样，我们全国男女工人坚决保证，为了解放我国神圣的领土台湾，我们要坚决完成国家交给我们的一切任务，要人有人，要力出力，保证前方后方的军需民用，不消灭蒋介石卖国集团誓不休止。
    中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通说：解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，是每一个中国人的共同的意愿，这个意愿是坚定不移的。美帝国主义现在虽然支持着蒋介石匪帮霸占台湾，但它是很虚弱的。古语所说的“进退维谷”，正是目前美国侵略者的窘境。只要我们戒骄戒躁，加强警惕，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，全国人民团结一致，我们有充分信心来完成我们解放台湾的神圣事业。
    中南行政委员会副主席张难先说，解放台湾是天经地义的事情。台湾人民自从祖国大陆和海南岛解放以后，天天盼望着从水深火热的苦难中解放出来。我们现在提出解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的口号，是非常及时和必要的。这个联合宣言通过和发布以后，我们全国人民要积极行动起来，为响应这个宣言中提出的号召而努力。
    中华全国工商业联合会副主任委员李烛尘说，解放台湾是全国六万万人民的神圣任务，不达目的，决不休止，这是我们坚定的立场。台湾成为中国的领土，比哥伦布发现美洲还早，开罗宣言和波茨坦公告又规定了台湾应交还中国，这些都是事实，也就是真理。蒋贼介石统治中国二十多年，祸国殃民，无恶不作，现在又逃到台湾继续卖国，全国人民欲得诛之而甘心。因此，解放台湾是全国人民和台湾同胞的共同要求。全国工商界人士应坚定信心，提高警惕，为支援解放台湾的斗争而努力不懈。
    中国人民政协全国委员会秘书长李维汉在发言中着重指出了在解放台湾斗争中，全国各民主阶级、各民主党派和各民族更加紧密团结的重要性，应把即将通过的联合宣言，经过各民主党派、各人民团体和各地协商机关进行广泛深入的传达，同时指出对于各种反革命的阴谋破坏活动应有高度的警惕。
    中国人民政协全国委员会常务委员乌兰夫说，解放台湾是我国各民族人民的共同愿望和迫切要求，也是保卫自己领土和主权完整的正当行动。内蒙古自治区人民对威胁我们祖国安全，侵犯中国主权，破坏中国领土完整，盘踞在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团与美国侵略者，表示无比的愤恨。他表示内蒙古人民要和全国人民更加紧密地团结，提高警惕，做好社会治安工作，巩固祖国的后方，同时，要增加工业、农业和畜牧业的生产，厉行节约，保证要粮有粮，要人有人，支援解放台湾的斗争。
    中国人民政协全国委员会委员李明扬说，我国大陆解放五年来，在毛主席的英明领导下，各种建设事业突飞猛进，人民生活日益改善，全国各族人民已团结成为一个和睦快乐的大家庭；只有台湾八百万同胞尚在蒋匪帮与美帝国主义的摧残压迫之下，过着牛马不如的生活。我们如果不去解放台湾，不但对不起我们的祖先，也对不起我们的后代。因此，解放台湾，是全国人民当前最重大的政治任务。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦说，解放台湾是一场严重的斗争，但我们清楚地知道，任何一个伟大的胜利，都是经过严重的斗争得来的。同时，我们解放台湾的决心也是义无反顾，勇往直前的。我们全体青年团员和全国青年，一定会精神百倍地加紧工作，加紧生产，加紧学习，特别是提高警惕，和一切反革命分子进行斗争，为解放台湾和最后彻底、全部、干净地消灭蒋介石卖国集团而奋斗到底。
    上海市工商业联合会主任委员盛丕华说，蒋介石匪帮是一小撮卖国分子，蒋匪介石是中国六万万人民的公敌。我们不能容忍蒋介石卖国集团勾结美国侵略者窃踞台湾，来作为扰乱我沿海的基地。上海人民更不会忘记蒋匪帮轰炸我们沿海城市和枪杀渔民的种种罪恶。我们工商业者和全国人民一样，和东南沿海各地人民一样，对于解放台湾的光荣事业，愿意贡献出一切力量。我们一定要做好自己的工作，保证爱国守法，积极经营，努力生产，接受改造，响应祖国的号召，为解放台湾而进行坚决斗争。
    浙江省协商委员会副主席包达三说，我们浙江处在解放台湾斗争的前线，五年来不断地遭受以台湾作巢穴的蒋介石卖国集团的骚扰和破坏。浙江二千多万人民以无比的兴奋的心情来迎接解放台湾的历史任务。解放台湾是一个斗争，在这个斗争里面，包含着军事斗争——这是主要的，也包含着外交、政治、经济、宣传等方面的斗争，要各方面配合起来，我们的斗争力量才是强大无比的。浙江人民一定要提高警惕，时刻留意，防止和消灭隐藏着的和新派来的美蒋特务。
    内蒙古自治区协商委员会筹备委员会副主席孙兰峰在发言中指出：蒋介石卖国集团在被中国人民赶出大陆以前和逃到台湾以后的种种出卖祖国和屠害人民的行为，是我国人民所决不能饶恕和容忍的。他说：我们全国人民一定要更加紧密地团结起来，高度发挥爱国主义精神，百倍努力地工作，贡献出我们一切的力量，我们是有充分的信心和决心完成解放台湾这一光荣神圣的事业的。
    中国海员工会筹备委员会副主任丘金在发言中代表中国全体海员，以及码头和所有水运企业的职工，对解放台湾的联合宣言表示完全拥护。他接着控诉了蒋介石卖国集团在美国舰队的指使和庇护下，以海盗的方式劫夺商船、渔船和屠杀海员、渔民的罪行。他说，中国全体海员、以及码头、船厂和所有水路运输的职工弟兄一定要在中国共产党的领导下，更加团结一致，继承支援解放海南岛、舟山群岛等战役的光荣经验，从各方面进行准备，更好地完成国家经济运输与国防运输任务，为支援解放台湾而奋斗到底！
    中华全国学生联合会副主席关若鸾说，我们学生深深了解台湾同胞和学生所受的痛苦。蒋介石匪帮现在正胁迫台湾青年学生和农民充当炮灰。今年七月，已有三万二千多名台湾学生被强迫参加“暑期青年战斗训练”，其中已有不少男女学生被迫编入金门岛等地的匪军中，反对强迫入征的青年学生遭受着逮捕和屠杀。蒋介石匪帮这种疯狂的行动，已使台湾变成一座恐怖的兵营。我国学生决不能容忍美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国贼的这种罪恶行动。我们的热血沸腾，我们向祖国宣誓，一定要更加努力学习，锻炼身体，时刻响应毛主席的号召，为解放台湾而斗争到底。
    九三学社中央常务委员潘菽说，我们决不能容许蒋介石匪帮窃据台湾作为叛国和卖国活动的巢穴。台湾一天不解放，全国人民就一天不能安枕，台湾的八百万同胞已深陷于水深火热之中，我们不向他们伸出援救之手，怎能对得起他们？而且，台湾不解放，也是亚洲及全世界和平的一个严重的祸根。这个联合宣言义正词严，代表着全中国人民的意志，真理和正义在我们这一边，胜利一定属于我们的。我代表南京市协商委员会和各民主党派地方组织表示，一定要为贯彻执行这个宣言所指出的解放台湾的历史任务而尽一切力量。
    上海总工会常务委员汤桂芬在发言中，首先代表上海一百四十万男女工人表示愿为完成解放台湾的光荣任务而奋斗到底。她说，上海处在解放台湾斗争的前线，我们上海工人向全国人民保证，一定要在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，与全国工人、全国人民更加紧密地团结一起，发扬上海工人光荣的革命传统，努力增加生产，厉行节约，进
  一步开展劳动竞赛，积极参加技术革新运动，提高和巩固劳动纪律，完成和超额完成国家生产计划，加速国家的社会主义工业化和国防现代化，并以迎接解放军解放大上海和支援解放舟山群岛战役的英勇精神，来参加和支援人民解放军解放台湾的斗争。
    上海市工商业联合会副主任委员荣毅仁说，为了响应解放台湾的伟大号召，上海市的工商业者，将坚决地和全国人民在一起，更紧密地团结在中国共产党和人民政府的周围，真诚地接受社会主义的改造，努力学习，服从国家计划，积极经营，提高警惕，严防特务造谣破坏，并要贡献人力物力财力来支援人民解放军解放台湾的斗争。我们还希望过去误信蒋介石匪帮的谣言而跑到台湾去的工商业者们，应该及时觉醒，热忱地响应祖国的号召，积极准备迎接人民解放军，重返故乡，参加祖国的伟大建设事业。
    重庆市协商委员会副主席胡子昂说，我来自重庆，深知重庆人民对蒋介石匪帮的痛恨。重庆解放前，蒋介石反动政权劫掠人民财产、破坏公共建设、屠杀革命志士的种种惨无人性的滔天罪行，都深深地刻印在重庆每一个人的心里。重庆人民和全国人民一样为解放台湾这一神圣的号召而感到无比的兴奋。重庆市人民根据自己亲身遭受的苦痛，对今天正被迫害的台湾同胞寄予深厚的同情，并愿为支援解放台湾而奋斗到底。
    武汉市工商业联合会主任委员陈经畬说，蒋介石匪帮丧尽天良，认贼作父，在美帝国主义嗾使下，胆敢在我东南沿海地区和岛屿进行骚扰和破坏活动，劫夺祖国商船和与我国通商的各国船舶，屠杀我国同胞，这种种罪行真是罄竹难书，是全国人民所不能忍受的。我们工商界一定要和全国人民一道加强团结，为恢复我国主权和领土的完整，而努力支援解放台湾的斗争。
    中国国民党革命委员会东北临时工作委员会召集人宁武在发言中表示辽宁省人民将和全国人民一道，努力增加生产，巩固国防，加强团结，提高警惕，在各个工作岗位上，继续不断地发挥爱国主义精神，为响应解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团这一伟大号召而贡献力量。
    中国国民党革命委员会华南临时工作委员会主任委员陈汝棠说，解放台湾的号召使广东省三千多万人民感到无限欢欣和鼓舞。蒋介石卖国集团不断侵犯我沿海地区，广东省便是首当其冲之一。广东人民遭受这些威胁，时刻都希望赶快解放我们国家的神圣领土台湾，让台湾同胞回到祖国自由幸福的怀抱，使我们的生产建设能得到和平的保障。广东省全体人民都将拥护和支持联合宣言，并为解放台湾而在加紧进行准备工作。
    天津市工商业联合会副主任委员毕鸣岐说，台湾在过去，在今天，在将来，都是中国领土不可分割的一部分。台湾的同胞们在蒋介石卖国集团的压榨下，失去了一切自由。解放台湾是台湾同胞日夜盼望的迫切要求，也是全国人民的一致愿望。天津市工商业者要坚决支援解放台湾，并要学习周总理的外交报告，以解放台湾作为工商业者爱国主义教育的具体内容，做到爱国守法，并向违法分子和反革命分子进行尖锐的斗争。
    中国人民政协全国委员会委员梁漱溟说，我拥护周总理的外交报告和中央人民政府委员会在批准周恩来总理兼外交部部长的外交报告时所通过的关于号召全国人民和中国人民解放军从各方面加强工作，为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团，最后完成我国人民的神圣解放事业而奋斗的决议。我也拥护这次会议即将通过的联合宣言，我愿响应联合宣言的号召，追随大家，为解放台湾尽我应尽的一分力量。我认为联合宣言中号召全国人民更加紧密地团结起来这一点是非常必要的。
    天主教南京教区教长李维光说，我是天主教南京教区的代表。美帝国主义曾利用天主教作为侵略中国的工具。蒋介石卖国集团也曾利用天主教作为反革命的工具；但是，中国天主教教友是热爱祖国和热爱和平的，我们绝不允许美国帝国主义侵占台湾，绝不允许蒋介石卖国集团继续盘踞台湾。我们要和全国人民一起为解放台湾而贡献一切力量。我们还希望在台湾的天主教教友不要为美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团所利用，早日回到祖国怀抱里来，享受宗教信仰自由和和平幸福的生活。
    青岛市工商业联合会副主任委员陈孟元说，几十年的亲身体验，使我深深感到旧社会的黑暗；五年来国家建设的成就，使我更加相信共产党领导的正确。现在蒋介石匪帮仍然盘踞在台湾，台湾同胞仍然过着暗无天日的生活。我们不能不去解救他们。“人同此心，心同此理”，解放台湾是任何一个爱国公民应该担当的义务。青岛是我国沿海要区，我们青岛人民要争取超额完成国家建设计划，支援解放台湾，还要提高警惕，努力支援人民解放军保卫祖国海防。
    沈阳市工商业联合会副主任委员卢广绩说，蒋介石匪帮盘踞台湾一天，我国大陆人民，就一天不会得到真正和平；台湾不解放，全国解放事业就不能算完成。我代表沈阳市工商业者，坚决拥护关于解放台湾的正义号召。我回到本地以后，要进行广泛宣传，使每一个工商业者充分认识解放台湾的重大意义和自己所应该承担的任务；还要动员全市工商业者进一步爱国守法，接受社会主义改造，用这样的实际行动来支援解放台湾。
    中华全国民主青年联合会副主席吴晗说，我们全国青年和全国人民在一起，决不能容忍蒋介石卖国集团把台湾变成叛国者的巢穴，决不能容忍美国侵略集团侵占我国神圣领土台湾，以台湾为基地向中国进行侵略，侵犯中国主权，破坏亚洲和世界和平。中国青年誓必尽一切的力量，加紧生产，努力学习，在各个岗位上做好自己的工作，完成和超额完成国家所给的任务，为解放台湾、反对美国干涉、保障祖国安全、保卫世界和平而奋斗。
    中国伊斯兰教协会委员马坚说，解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团以完成我国人民的解放事业，是我国各民族人民的共同愿望和一致要求。我们全国信仰伊斯兰教的十个少数民族的人民和其余各少数民族人民，将与全国人民更加坚强地团结起来，在中国共产党、人民政府、毛主席的正确领导下，为解放台湾而奋斗。
    陕西省工商业联合会主任委员韩望尘在发言中谴责了美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团窃踞台湾的罪行。他代表陕西省和西安市工商界坚决拥护解放台湾这一正确的、适时的措施。他说，在陕西省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上，工商界的代表们坚决表示：誓以爱国守法，积极经营，服从国营经济领导，接受社会主义改造，踊跃交纳税款等实际行动来支援解放台湾；并要求被选为全国人民代表大会的代表把这坚决的意志带到全国人民代表大会会议上来。
    旅大市协商委员会副主席乔传珏说，在抗日战争胜利之前，和台湾同胞有着同样遭遇的旅大人民，对台湾同胞近六十年来过着极其惨痛的奴隶生活，格外感到切肤的同情。旅大是一个沿海的工业城市，又是一个国防重地。我们深深体会到在解放台湾的斗争中，我们也担负着重要的责任。旅大人民将更加紧密地团结成为一个坚强的队伍，保持高度的警惕，巩固祖国的沿海边防，防止任何敌人的骚扰和破坏，并要增加生产，厉行节约，提高工农业生产和各项工作水平，争取完成和超额完成国家建设计划，以支持中国人民解放军解放台湾。
    济南市协商委员会副主席王祝晨说，美国妄想干涉我国人民解放台湾的神圣事业，但是，它在朝鲜战争中的失败，证明所谓实力是不足怕的。当然，我们还必须提高警惕，不要骄傲。山东处在海防前线，山东省人民和济南市各民主党派组织、各人民团体听说要解放台湾，莫不欢欣鼓舞，我们一定和全国人民一样，担负起在解放台湾的伟大任务中我们应负的职责。
    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会副主席侯德榜说，我们决不容许背叛祖国的蒋介石匪帮割据祖国领土的任何部分，更不容许这个匪帮勾结外国武力来背叛祖国。蒋介石匪帮和美国侵略者，坐在我们家中捣乱，妨碍我们进行和平建设，破坏亚洲和世界的和平。所以解放台湾是我们神圣的任务。全国科学工作者一定要紧紧地团结在中国共产党、毛主席和人民政府的周围，努力研究科学，提高科学理论水平，使科学为新中国的社会主义工业化和解放台湾的神圣事业服务。
  河北省协商委员会副主席王葆真在发言中，以许多生动的事例表达了河北省三千六百万人民要求解放台湾的深切愿望。他满怀信心地说，我们相信在毛主席的英明领导下，在全国人民的一致努力下，我们一定能一步一步地从胜利走向胜利，台湾一定能得到解放，台湾同胞一定能回到祖国怀抱里来。
    中国人民政协全国委员会委员钱昌照说，我曾三次到过台湾，我深知台湾人民在水深火热之中，是如何渴望早日回到祖国的怀抱。尤其在一九四七年二月二十八日，蒋介石向台湾人民进行大屠杀后，台湾人民对蒋介石匪帮更是恨之入骨。现在台湾的情况是：法西斯的政治，殖民地的经济，腐败没落的军事。台湾人民盼望解放，有如大旱之望云霓。台湾是一块美丽的土地，有富饶的资源，丰足的产物，有勤劳的人民，但这一切在蒋介石卖国集团的统治下，受着各种糟蹋和蹂躏。因此，台湾必须早日解放，使台湾同胞早日从暗无天日之中解放出来，并且使台湾恢复它原有的美丽面貌。解放台湾的联合宣言是全国六万万人的正义呼声，它将响遍全世界每一个角落。
    河南省协商委员会副主席侯连瀛说，我听了周副主席的报告，研究了联合宣言草案，我完全同意并坚决拥护。因为它充分表达了全国六万万人民的意志，它是正义和胜利的旗帜，它是我国人民保卫祖国领土完整和保卫世界和平的有力的实际行动的宣告。解放台湾的神圣事业的胜利，不是用等待、忍耐、迁就和妥协所能得来的，而必须用自己的力量去主动争取。毛主席曾说过：“一定要把革命进行到底！”今天我们更体会到这句话的重大意义。只有把台湾人民从蒋介石卖国集团的暴政下解放出来，才能获得中国人民的伟大的解放事业的完全胜利。
    湖北省协商委员会副主席聂国青在发言中，指出了美国帝国主义者长期与中国人民为敌的种种事实。他说，如美国帝国主义者敢于阻挠中国人民解放台湾，那么它所取得的后果，将如在朝鲜发动侵略战争中所取得后果一样，遭到惨重的失败。湖北人民今年遭到了水灾的侵袭，但也将像和洪水斗争一样，尽一切所能和全国人民一道，坚决完成解放台湾的任务。
    陕西省协商委员会副主席韩兆鹗说，解放台湾是一件伟大而艰巨的工作，必须全国团结一致努力。我们陕西省人民与全国人民一样，坚决响应这一正义的号召。在陕西省第一届人民代表大会会议上，代表们在发言中，在提案中，都曾慷慨激昂地提出坚决解放台湾的问题。代表们说：我们陕西省必须保持光荣的革命传统，为支援台湾解放而尽一切力量。这说明了陕西省人民的爱国热情是充沛的、高涨的，从这里也看到了伟大祖国不可战胜的无穷无尽的力量，它将冲破一切人为的阴霾和阻碍，而使我们完成解放台湾的神圣大业。
    上海市协商委员会常务委员刘靖基说，我是上海工商界纺织工业中的一分子，也是民主建国会的会员，我要以下列的实际行动来拥护解放台湾，这就是：一、要以身作则接受社会主义改造，加强学习，爱国守法，积极经营，增加生产，厉行节约，按时按质按量完成国家计划；二、加强爱国主义教育，协助政府做好一切工作，贡献一切力量，支援人民解放军；三、对逃往台湾的工商业者进行宣传，说明人民政府的宽大政策，号召他们发扬爱国主义精神，热烈响应祖国的号召，准备迎接人民解放军。
    安徽省协商委员会副主席陈荫南说，解放台湾，是我国六万万同胞的一致愿望，也是我国人民的光荣任务。我们安徽省是沿海各省市的后方，更应坚决地响应中央人民政府解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的号召，在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，发动一切力量，作好一切工作，为支援解放台湾、保卫亚洲及世界和平而奋斗到底。
    天津市协商委员会副主席刘锡瑛说，天津市人民和全国人民一样坚决要求解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团。如果美国侵略集团敢于阻挠我们解放台湾，它将受到比在朝鲜战争中更严厉的一次教训。我代表天津市各民主党派组织、各人民团体表示一定要紧密团结，提高警惕，为拯救台湾八百万同胞，保证祖国和平建设的顺利进行而努力。
    中国人民政协全国委员会常务委员黄琪翔在发言中阐述了自己对解放台湾问题和国际形势的认识。他说，我们必须估计到各方面的情况，从各方面加强工作，不能坐待胜利。美国侵略者企图干涉我们解放台湾的正义行动，它只会在全世界更加孤立，内部也更加混乱，终将遭到可耻的失败。我们是有充足信心的。我们有中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，任何困难都是可以克服的。
    广州市工商业联合会主任委员黄长水在发言中着重指出，为了解放台湾，我们必须在各个岗位上做好工作。私营工商业者必须高度发挥爱国主义精神，以百倍的努力来爱国守法，厉行节约，努力生产，加强学习，接受社会主义改造，和违法分子作不调和的斗争；并要提高警惕，检举反抗社会主义改造的破坏分子，保证社会主义建设的胜利成功，争取解放台湾的神圣斗争的胜利早日到来。
    江苏省协商委员会委员刘国钧说，我们江苏省四千一百万人民热烈拥护解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团的伟大号召。我们也坚决反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土、干涉我国内政的滔天罪行。江苏正处在解放台湾斗争的前线，我们全省人民和全国人民一样，具有百倍的信心、坚强的意志和高度的警惕；我们一定在各个岗位上加强工作，积极支援解放军解放台湾。
    台湾民主自治同盟中央理事田富达说，我们台湾高山族人民长期遭受着日本帝国主义的侵略和奴役，但从来没有忘记自己是中国人。日本帝国主义投降后，蒋介石卖国集团继承了日本的法西斯统治，高山族人民依旧过着饥饿、疾病和死亡的非人生活；但是，高山族人民和全台湾人民一样，从来不屈服于外国侵略者和国内反动统治，有着敢于反抗侵略、反抗压迫的英勇斗争的传统。今天正在讨论和即将通过的这个联合宣言，不仅充分反映了全国人民对台湾同胞的关怀，以及彻底完成祖国解放事业的决心，同时也充分表达了高山族同胞和全台湾同胞早日获得解放、和祖国人民团聚的迫切要求。高山族人民将响应祖国的号召，加强和全台湾人民的团结，发扬爱国主义精神，继续斗争，积蓄力量，准备迎接和配合中国人民解放军解放台湾。
    哈尔滨市协商委员会副主席刘珮芝在发言中表示，要将这次会议的精神传达贯彻到哈尔滨市各界人民中去。他说，为了解放台湾，我们要加强团结，高度提高警惕，严防蒋匪特务活动，以实际行动，积极努力，储备一切力量，为实现国家社会主义工业化，为支援解放台湾这一光荣历史任务的最后胜利而奋斗到底。
    中南行政委员会副主席陈铭枢说，我们武汉市人民以坚强的信心和决心拥护解放台湾的号召。武汉市人民在这次两个多月的紧张防汛斗争中所取得的成就与蒋介石反动政府统治时人民遭受一九三一年大水灾时的惨痛情形对比，更加认识到中国共产党和人民政府领导的伟大和英明，更加感到人民力量的伟大。经过洪水考验的武汉市一百五十万人民将以百倍的信心，无敌的意志，战斗的精神，更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和人民政府的周围，全力支援解放台湾。
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生说，蒋介石卖国集团在美国侵略者庇护下加紧进行对我国沿海地区的骚扰和种种破坏活动，劫掠我国商船和与我国贸易的商船，掠夺人民财物，诱骗和强迫我台湾青年作炮灰，这种种丧尽良心的罪恶行为，是新中国各族广大人民决不能容忍的。我代表全国一千万信仰伊斯兰教的十个民族的人民，要同全国人民一起响应政府解放台湾的号召，为最后完成中国人民的神圣解放事业而奋斗。
    杭州市协商委员会委员刘开渠说，浙江虽然是蒋匪的家乡，蒋匪统治时期受害极深。因此，杭州市人民对蒋匪及其卖国集团，是极为痛恨的。杭州市全体人民与全国人民一样，向我中央人民政府和毛主席保证：一定全心全意为支援解放台湾而努力完成和超额完成各项生产任务和工作。我们一定要更加提高警惕，因为浙江和杭州在沿海前线，又是蒋匪盘踞最久最深入的地方，蒋匪帮必然会从那里钻空子。我们一定要更加坚强地团结起来，为解放台湾而贡献出一切力量。
    中国人民政协全国委员会常务委员罗隆基说，现在提出解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团的号召是非常正确的及时的。美帝国主义现在在军事上、外交上已陷于日益窘迫和孤立的境地。古语说：“……一鼓作气，再而衰，三而竭，彼竭我盈，故克之。”美国侵略者发动侵略朝鲜的战争遭到失败，他破坏印度支那恢复和平的协议的阴谋又告破产，这已是
  “再而衰”；今天他想要干涉我国解放台湾，就到了“三而竭”的程度了。所以我们要足够地认识到美国侵略者的这种情形，强大的中国人民不会因为美国侵略者穷凶极恶而丝毫动摇解放台湾的决心，美帝国主义的阴谋是绝对不能实现的。
    中国人民政协全国委员会常务委员熊克武在书面意见中说：蒋介石卖国集团自被赶出大陆以后，一直托庇于美帝国主义，与中国人民为敌。他所进行的许多祸国殃民的罪恶活动，早为我国人民所不能容忍。我们必须坚决解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，我们每一个中国人民都要为完成这个光荣的历史任务而努力。站立起来了的中国人民是不可战胜的，我们解放台湾的斗争是正义的，全世界的和平力量都是支持我们的，我们一定能够克服一切阻挠，胜利地解放台湾。
