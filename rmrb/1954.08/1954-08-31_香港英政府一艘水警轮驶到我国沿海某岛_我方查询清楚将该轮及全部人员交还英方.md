Xinhua News Agency, 30th: On July 29th, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government received a note from the British Chargé d'Affaires requesting an inquiry into whether a missing Hong Kong British government water police boat had been found in Chinese territorial waters.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after inquiring with relevant departments, learned that on the dawn of July 29th, the garrison on a certain island off our coast discovered a small boat drifting to the island. Our coastal defense forces then took the boat into custody. The shape of the boat was similar to the description in the British Chargé d'Affaires' note, and it also had the identification markings mentioned in the note.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately informed the British Chargé d'Affaires of the results of the inquiry on August 12th and requested the British Chargé d'Affaires to inform the Hong Kong British government that it could send representatives to Guangzhou to discuss specific arrangements for retrieving the boat.

The Guangzhou Foreign Affairs Office agreed on specific arrangements with Mr. Du Liwei, the representative of the Hong Kong British government who came to Guangzhou on the 20th. On the 22nd, our side returned the original boat and all equipment and objects on board to Mr. Du Liwei.

All eight crew members on the original boat stated that their homes were in Hong Kong and that they were willing to return. They returned with Mr. Du Liwei on the original boat on the 22nd.

The entire repatriation process was carried out according to the original arrangements. Mr. Du Liwei expressed his gratitude for this matter and issued an official receipt, stating that everything was complete and undamaged.

    香港英政府一艘水警轮驶到我国沿海某岛
    我方查询清楚将该轮及全部人员交还英方
    【新华社三十日讯】七月二十九日，我中央人民政府外交部接到英国代办处照会一件，请求查询在中国领水内是否发现有一艘香港英国政府失踪的水警轮。
    外交部经向有关方面查询，获悉，七月二十九日黎明，我国沿海某岛驻军发现有一小艇驶到该岛。我海防部队遂将该艇看押起来。该艇的形状类似英国代办处照会中的描述，并有照会中所提的编号标志。
    外交部当即于八月十二日将查询结果告知了英国代办处，并请英国代办处转告香港英国政府可派代表至广州商洽领回该艇的具体安排。
    广州外事处于二十日与前来广州的香港英国政府代表杜利华先生商定具体安排。二十二日我方即将原艇及艇上全部设备和物件发还，交予杜利华先生。
    原艇上的八个工作人员均表示家在香港，愿意回去，并已于二十二日乘原艇随杜利华先生返还。
    全部发还过程俱按原定安排进行。杜利华先生曾就此事表示谢意，并出具了正式收据，说明一切完整无损。
