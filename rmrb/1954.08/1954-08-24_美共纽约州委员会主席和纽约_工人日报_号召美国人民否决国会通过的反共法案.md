Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 22nd: The United States Senate and House of Representatives on the 19th respectively passed the compromise bill passed by the joint conference of the two houses, which effectively outlawed the American Communist Party, and submitted the bill to President Eisenhower for signature.

This blatant fascist bill, finally passed by the U.S. Congress, stipulates the deprivation of the American Communist Party's legal and political rights, and requires members of the American Communist Party to register with the government, otherwise they will be sentenced to a maximum fine of $10,000 and five years in prison. The bill also stipulates that members of Communist organizations may not obtain passports or hold government positions, and so-called "Communist-controlled" unions may not enjoy collective bargaining rights.

Coordinating with this bill, the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have also passed two other fascist bills: the first bill stipulates that the government has the right to deprive people of their civil rights under the pretext of so-called "conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government by force"; the second bill stipulates that the government can sentence any American who does not conform to the will of the reactionary group to death for the trumped-up crime of "spies in peacetime."

The fascist legislation of the U.S. Congress was immediately opposed by some American groups and organizations. The American Civil Liberties Union issued a statement on the 20th, condemning the bill that deprives the American Communist Party of all political rights as "unconstitutional and foolishly contradicts the guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of association." The American Socialist Party also issued a statement saying that the bill depriving the American Communist Party of its political rights "is in fact a blow to the basic freedoms of Americans," and that the passage of this bill is equivalent to showing the world that "America is shrouded in terror."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 23rd: The New York "Worker's Daily" published an editorial on the 18th, calling on the American people to rise up and demand the rejection of the bill passed by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives that prohibits Communist activities.

The editorial said: This despicable and shameful gangster action hastily passed by the Senate and the House will shock the rest of the world. In Europe, only in fascist Spain is the Communist Party declared illegal. The whole world knows what kind of Hitler-style tyranny is lurking behind this bill.

The editorial said: But this madness is not the will of the United States. There is no indication that the American people want a Hitler-style and McCarthy-style America. Now the whole country must, with an awakened conscience, shout loudly to Eisenhower, urging him to reject this act that betrays American traditions and democratic ideals.

Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: According to TASS, Washington, August 21st: Gilson, chairman of the New York State Committee of the American Communist Party, issued a statement to the press regarding the Congressional passage of the bill declaring the Communist Party illegal.

The statement said: "In an atmosphere of political trickery and hysteria, Congress has for the first time in our history passed a bill to outlaw a political party. This bill was passed hastily, without Congress holding hearings or submitting a report, and it is clearly an unconstitutional bill that deprives citizens of their rights. This bill harms the rights of organized labor and all those who disagree with the cabinet's policies... Today's events once again demonstrate that labor and other democratic advocates must take independent political action."

Gilson continued, that in any case, the Communist Party must continue to fight to defend its legal rights and the rights of organized labor, and the Communist Party is convinced that doing so is also defending American democratic traditions.

### 美共纽约州委员会主席和纽约“工人日报”  号召美国人民否决国会通过的反共法案

    美共纽约州委员会主席和纽约“工人日报”
    号召美国人民否决国会通过的反共法案
    【新华社二十二日讯】　华盛顿消息：美国参议院和众议院在十九日分别通过了参众两院联席会议通过的实际上使美国共产党处于非法状态的折衷法案，并且把这个法案提交艾森豪威尔总统签署。
    美国国会最后通过的这个赤裸裸的法西斯法案，规定剥夺美国共产党的法律权利和政治权利，规定美国共产党党员必须向政府登记，否则就要被判处最高可达一万美元的罚金和五年徒刑。法案还规定共产党组织的成员不得领取护照和担任政府职务，所谓“共产党控制”的工会不得享有集体谈判权。
    配合着这个法案，美国参众两院还先后通过了另外两个法西斯法案：第一个法案规定政府有权以所谓“阴谋以武力推翻美国政府”为借口，剥夺人民的公民权；第二个法案规定政府可以用所谓“和平时期的间谍”这个莫须有的罪名把任何不投合反动集团意旨的美国人判处死刑。
    美国国会的法西斯立法马上遭到美国一些团体和组织的反对。美国民权保障联盟二十日发表声明，谴责剥夺美国共产党一切政治权利的法案是“违反宪法的，并且愚蠢地和言论自由、结社自由的保证相抵触”。美国社会党也发表声明说：剥夺美国共产党政治权利的法案“事实上是打击美国人的基本自由”，通过这个法案就等于向全世界表明“美国笼罩在恐怖之中”。
    【新华社柏林二十三日电】　纽约“工人日报”十八日发表社论，号召美国人民起来要求否决美国参议院和众议院通过的禁止共产党活动的法案。
    社论说：参议院和众议院草草通过的这个卑鄙可耻的匪棍行动将震惊世界其余地区。在欧洲，只有在法西斯西班牙，共产党才被宣布为非法。全世界都知道，在这个法案后面，潜藏着什么样的希特勒式的暴政。
    社论说：但是，这种疯狂行为并不是美国的意志。没有任何迹象说明美国人民愿意有一个希特勒式的和麦卡锡式的美国。现在全国必须本着觉醒的良心向艾森豪威尔大声疾呼，督促他否决这个背弃美国传统与民主理想的行动。
    【新华社二十二日讯】　据塔斯社华盛顿二十一日讯：美国共产党纽约州委员会主席吉尔逊就国会通过宣布共产党非法的法案向报界发表声明。
    声明说：“在充满政治权术气味的歇斯底里气氛中，国会在我国历史上第一次通过了一项取缔一个政党的法案。这个法案是草草通过的，国会既没有举行过意见听取会，也没有提出报告，它显然是违反宪法的剥夺公民权利的法案。这个法案损害有组织的劳工和所有不同意内阁政策的人的权利……今日的事件再度表明劳工和其他民主的拥护者必须采取独立的政治行动。”
    吉尔逊继续说，不管怎么样，共产党一定要继续为维护它的合法权利和有组织的劳工的权利而斗争，共产党深信这样做也就是保卫美国的民主传统。
