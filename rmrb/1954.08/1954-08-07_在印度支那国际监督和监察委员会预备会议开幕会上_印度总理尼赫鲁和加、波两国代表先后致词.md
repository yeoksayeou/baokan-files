Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 6th: According to the Indian News Service's New Delhi dispatch of August 2nd, at the opening meeting of the Preparatory Meeting of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Indochina on August 1st, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Canadian High Commissioner to India Escott Reid, and Polish Ambassador to India Jerzy Grudzinski delivered speeches.

    In his opening remarks, Nehru first welcomed the representatives attending the meeting. Nehru then said: "The Geneva Accords have stipulated various time limits for the start of work by the International Supervisory and Control Commissions and for other events to take place. Therefore, we here believe that unless we act quickly, it may be difficult to keep up with developments."

    Nehru said: "We have also invited representatives from other governments, such as France, Laos, Cambodia, the State of Vietnam, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Obviously, their status is different from that of the Commission. It is clear that we have invited them because we believe that doing so may help us create a good atmosphere of cooperation. There may be certain issues that we may have to discuss with them."

    Nehru said: "I am very optimistic that not only will the members of the Commission themselves cooperate fully, but I also hope that other relevant countries will cooperate fully. I say this not merely as a pious hope, but because this is the impression gained from the Geneva Conference." Nehru said that the Geneva Conference was able to make decisions because each party had a desire to reach some kind of agreement. "I think that in this regard, the Geneva Conference can be considered unprecedented, and therefore produced very good results."

    Nehru said, "I assure you that when we represent India in this task, we are fully aware of the great importance of this task, and we also feel that this task can only be successfully completed with the fullest cooperation of the other member countries of the Commission."

    Escott Reid said: "The task we three countries have undertaken is glorious but also very arduous. We accept this task with the hope that we can help the people of Indochina, who have suffered greatly in the past decade, to achieve peace, stability, and freedom. We accept this task because we know that the peace, stability, and freedom of any part of the world will contribute to the cause of peace everywhere. We believe that the Commission has a reasonable opportunity to carry out its work effectively."

    Grudzinski said: "Poland will do everything possible to contribute to the achievement of the work of the Commission, which aims to stabilize peace in Indochina."

    在印度支那国际监督和监察委员会预备会议开幕会上
    印度总理尼赫鲁和加、波两国代表先后致词
    【新华社六日讯】据印度新闻处新德里二日消息，在印度支那国际监督和监察委员会预备会议八月一日的开幕会议上，印度总理尼赫鲁、加拿大驻印度高级专员埃斯科特·里德和波兰驻印度大使叶日·格鲁金斯基先后致词。
    尼赫鲁在开幕词中首先向出席会议的代表表示欢迎。尼赫鲁接着说：日内瓦的协定为各国际监督和监察委员会开始工作和其他要发生的事情都规定下各种时限，因此我们这里认为，除非我们迅速行动起来，否则，可能会难于赶上事态的发展。
    尼赫鲁说：我们还邀请了其他政府的代表，如法国、老挝、柬埔寨、越南国和越南民主共和国的代表。显然他们的地位是和委员会不同的。很明显，我们邀请他们是因为我们认为，这样做也许可以帮助我们创造一种良好的合作气氛。可能有某些问题我们也许必须要和他们讨论。
    尼赫鲁说：我非常乐观地相信，不仅委员会本身的委员们会进行充分的合作，而且，我希望，其他有关各国也会进行充分的合作。我这样说，并不是仅仅作为一种虔诚的希望，而是因为这是从日内瓦会议上所得到的印象。尼赫鲁说，日内瓦会议之所以能做出决定，是因为每一方都怀有这种希望达成某种协议的愿望。我认为，在这方面，很可以认为日内瓦会议是空前未有的，因此产生了很好的结果。
    尼赫鲁说，我向你们保证：我们代表印度担任这项工作时，是充分认识到这项工作的伟大重要意义的，我们并且觉得，只有在委员会的其他委员国的最充分合作下才能使这项工作圆满结束。
    埃斯科特·里德说：我们三国所担任的是光荣但又很艰巨的任务。我们接受这种任务，是希望我们能够帮助那些在最近十年中遭受过极大痛苦的印度支那人民获得和平、稳定和自由。我们之所以接受这种任务，是因为我们知道世界上任何部分的和平、稳定和自由的情况，都会对于任何地方的和平事业有贡献。我们相信委员会有合理的机会来有效地进行工作。
    格鲁金斯基说：波兰要尽一切可能来对目的在于稳定印度支那和平的委员会的工作的成就有所贡献。
