According to the Xi'an Masses Daily: From May 11th to June 3rd this year, over 1.7 million jin of grain and 4,800 bags of flour were transported through Baqiao, Xiaying, Huaxian, and Huayin railway stations in Shaanxi Province. During the transportation process, due to the bureaucracy and other poor work styles of the station staff and grain department cadres, 327,000 jin of rice, corn, peas, etc., and 500 bags of flour were damaged by rain and dampness. Among them, 18,574 jin sprouted, became moldy, or deteriorated, and 4,750 jin were completely moldy and inedible.

In April, Huayin, Huaxian, Tongguan and other counties urgently needed grain supplies from the state. The Shaanxi Provincial People's Government Grain Department and the Weinan Special District Grain Section transferred a batch of peas and corn from Lantian and Luonan counties. On May 8th, Huayin and other counties submitted the carload plan for the third five-day period of May to Baqiao Station. The grain was delivered to the station on time and continuously. By the morning of the 12th, over 700,000 jin of grain had arrived at the station, but no railcars had been allocated. That night it rained, and it continued for two days, resulting in 252 bags (200 jin per bag) of peas and corn being soaked by rainwater, with 13 bags being the most severely soaked and partially sprouted. The comrades stationed at the station from the three counties repeatedly inquired and learned that the stationmaster on duty, Yu Deshui, had forgotten to report the "five-day carload plan" to his superiors.

On May 15th, 240,000 jin of glutinous rice was transported from Zhouzhi County to Dali County. The glutinous rice arrived at Xiaying Station in the afternoon of the same day. On the morning of the 16th, Yang Runxia of the Dali County People's Government Grain Section notified the county transportation team to allocate cars to transport the rice. However, Lei Zhiyuan, the head of the business operation section of the transportation team, said: "The news of transporting glutinous rice came too late and should be placed in the fourth priority for handling." Only ten trucks were allocated on the afternoon of the 17th to transport the rice, while a large number of other vehicles continued to transport fertilizer, goods, etc. At that time, comrades from the grain section repeatedly pointed out to the transportation team that the Dali County Transportation Committee had already decided that when grain, coal, and other goods needed to be transported simultaneously, the transportation of grain and coal should be given the first priority. However, the comrades of the transportation team still did not follow this policy. By May 20th, less than 140,000 jin of glutinous rice had been transported, and 510 bags of glutinous rice were still piled up in the open at Xiaying Station. In the afternoon of the 20th, it rained, and 150 bags of glutinous rice (30,000 jin) were soaked by rainwater. Among them, 1,034 jin were moldy and deteriorated, and 640 jin were completely inedible. The Dali County People's Government Grain Section also lacked attention to the grain receiving work. For 240,000 jin of husked fine grain, only a young cadre with no grain receiving experience was sent; and there were no pre-rain and moisture protection instructions, so there was no preparation. When it rained, this cadre actively tried to borrow tarpaulins and drain water, but it was too late.

On May 20th, 340,000 jin of corn was transferred from Qishan County to Huaxian County. When the grain trucks drove into Huaxian Station on the same day, it was raining. In order to win the "Red Banner of Excellence," the station simply emphasized accelerating the turnover of railcars and mobilized employees to unload grain in the rain. The station neither notified the Huaxian County People's Government Grain Section to receive the grain before unloading nor made any rain protection preparations, and unloaded the grain on the platform, allowing the water from the eaves to flow into the grain stacks. As a result, 140,000 jin of corn was rained on and wetted, more than 40,000 jin of which were severely wetted, and more than 100 jin sprouted; due to the breaking of grain bags during the rush unloading, there were also 100 jin of grain scattered on the ground. Two days after unloading the grain, most of the grain was still wet and piled up at the station, and the scattered grain was not cleaned up. Zhang Furong of the Huaxian People's Procuratorate pointed out to the stationmaster of the station, An Pandou: He should take timely measures to properly handle the scattered and wetted grain. An Pandou said: "It doesn't matter, it's nothing, it's still dry in the middle, only the edges are wet (actually, the inside is already very wet)." Zhang Furong wanted him to go to the site to inspect it together. He said: "I'm not going, I'm busy, how can there be unloading grain without scattering some grain, you have to find the stationmaster even if some grain is scattered!"

On June 3rd, 300,000 jin of rice was transferred from Qishan County to Chaoyi County. Because the shipping information sent from Qishan County was mistakenly written as Huayin as the recipient, four railcars of grain were unloaded at Huayin Station in the afternoon of the same day at 6:00 PM. It was about to rain at that time. The station neither notified the Huayin County People's Government Grain Section to receive the grain nor selected a place to unload the grain. For the sake of convenience, it unloaded the grain in the most concave place near the water tower. At 11:00 PM that night, there was heavy rain, and the rainwater on the ground flowed to the grain stacks, soaking the grain stacks more than five inches deep. On the morning of the 4th, the station's deputy stationmasters, Wang Wenxuan and Wu Fuli, discovered that the grain stacks were deeply soaked, but they did not immediately notify the Huayin County People's Government Grain Section or mobilize all employees to rescue the grain with all their strength. They only led a few employees to drain the water. The loading and unloading workers continued to rush to unload the grain on the fourth railcar. In the afternoon, Li Zuolin, the correspondent of the Huayin County People's Government Grain Section, went to the station to get a fire extinguisher. The station sent a message to the Grain Section to receive the grain. Li Zuolin forgot to notify. It was not until after 9:00 AM on the morning of the 5th that the station officially sent someone to notify the Huayin County People's Government Grain Section to receive the grain. After the Grain Section cadres arrived at the station, they did not actively rescue the grain. After arguing for a few hours about whether the tarpaulin on the grain stack was covered before or after the rain, they began to rescue the grain. After the Huayin County People's Government Grain Section realized that this batch of grain was being transported to Chaoyi, it no longer actively carried out rescue work. As a result, 51,800 jin of state rice was wetted, deteriorated, and moldy. Among them, 2,942 jin were completely inedible, 3,698 jin were moldy, and 45,030 jin had a moldy taste. According to calculations, the loss of moldy grain to be sold at a reduced price and the cost of re-bagging totaled more than 3.48 million yuan. Prior to this accident, Huayin Station had twice previously damaged state flour and grain. The first time was in December of last year, when 131 bags of flour with the smell of kerosene were stored in the station's warehouse. Due to poor storage, 71 bags were bitten through by mice. In February of this year, the station simply emphasized the turnover of railcars and unloaded a large amount of rice in the snow, causing 5,171 bags of rice to be wetted, resulting in a loss of 318 jin and a re-bagging fee of 2.58 million yuan.

In addition, some other grain accidents occurred in these counties, resulting in a total of 320,000 jin of state grain and 500 bags of flour being rained on and wetted.

The above series of accidents damaging state grain not only caused economic losses to the state, but also created a negative political impact among the masses. Some people in the masses said: "I paid a good price for flour, but bought wet flour!" Others said: "The government collects our good grain, why sell bad grain?" However, all these economic and political losses have not aroused enough attention from relevant leaders and responsible units. The Huayin County Committee of the Communist Party of China did not take the necessary measures for the Huayin Station's several accidents that damaged state grain. It only thought that the county's "problem was not big," and said that the station was not under the leadership of the county party committee, as if there was a reason to lose state grain. The Dali County Party Committee did not examine the specific situation of the serious grain damage accident of the Dali County People's Government Grain Section this time. After the accident, the Weinan Special District Grain Section only sent people to inspect it as a routine matter and submitted a document to the superiors. It did not actively think of ways to prevent such accidents from happening again in the future from examining the causes and responsibilities.

    华阴等县火车站和粮食机关人员缺乏责任心
    损坏了三十多万斤粮食
    据西安群众日报报道：在陕西省灞桥、下营、华县和华阴等火车站上，今年五月十一日到六月三日调运了一百七十多万斤粮食和四千八百多袋面粉。在调运过程中，由于车站工作人员、粮食部门干部的官僚主义和其他恶劣作风，以致三十二万七千斤大米、玉米、豌豆等和五百袋面粉遭到雨淋、水湿，其中出芽、霉坏、变质的有一万八千五百七十四斤，完全霉坏不能吃的有四千七百五十斤。
    四月间，华阴、华县、潼关等县急需国家供应粮食，陕西省人民政府粮食厅和渭南专署粮食科从蓝田、雒南两县调运一批豌豆、玉米供给。华阴等县于五月八日向灞桥车站交出五月份第三个五日要车计划。粮食按时陆续运站，到十二日上午，到站粮食共七十多万斤，但没见拨来车皮。当晚下了雨，连下两天，以致二百五十二包（每包二百斤）豌豆和玉米遭雨水浸湿，其中十三包水湿最重，部分生芽。三县驻站同志多方追问，才知道是该站值班站长于得水把“五日要车计划”忘记向上报了。
    五月十五日从盩厔县运往大荔糯米二十四万斤。当日午后糯米运到下营车站。十六日早晨，大荔县人民政府粮食科杨润夏到该县运输队通知拨车运米。运输队业务经营股股长雷致远却说：“运糯米消息报来迟了，应放到第四位搬运。”到十七日下午才拨出十辆大车运米，其他大批车辆继续拉运肥料、百货等。当时，粮食科的同志一再向运输队指出：大荔县运输委员会早已经决定，运输工作中粮食、煤和其他货物同时需要运输时，粮、煤运输应该放在第一位。但运输队同志仍没按照这个方针办事。直到五月二十日才运走糯米不足十四万斤，还有五百一十包糯米露天堆放在下营车站。二十日午后天雨，一百五十包糯米（三万斤）遭雨水浸湿，其中有一千零三十四斤霉坏、变质，有六百四十斤根本不能食用了。大荔县人民政府粮食科对接粮工作，也是不够重视的。二十四万斤的剥皮细粮，只派了一个年轻而毫无接粮经验的干部去；对防雨防湿工作，事前也没有叮嘱，以致毫无准备。下雨时，这个干部虽然积极地多方寻借帆布，冒雨排水，但已经来不及了。
    五月二十日，由岐山县调往华县玉米三十四万斤。当日粮车开进华县车站时正下雨。该站为了争得“优胜红旗”，单纯强调加速车皮周转，动员职工冒雨抢卸粮食。该站在卸车前既没通知华县人民政府粮食科领粮，又不作防雨准备，就把粮食卸在月台上，一任房檐水流入粮垛。结果使十四万斤玉米遭雨淋和水湿，其中有四万多斤水湿最重，发芽的有一百多斤；由于抢卸摔烂粮包，遗撒在地上的粮食，也有一百斤。卸粮两天后，大部粮食照旧湿堆在车站上，抛撒的粮食也没有清扫。华县人民检察署张富荣向该站站长安攀斗指出：应及时设法对抛撒和水湿的粮食进行妥善处理。安攀斗说：“不要紧，没啥，中间还干着哩，光湿了个边边（实际内部已湿很多）。”张富荣要他一同到现场去检查一下。他说：“我不去，我忙着哩，那有卸粮食不撒点粮食的事，撒点粮食都要寻站长哩！”
    六月三日，从岐山县调往朝邑县大米三十万斤。因岐山县发货时，误写成华阴收货，四车粮食当日午后六点多钟在华阴车站卸车。当时就要下雨，该站既没通知华阴县人民政府粮食科领粮，也没选择卸粮位置，只图方便，把粮食卸在水塔附近最凹的地方。当夜十一时大雨，地面雨水流向粮垛，浸湿粮垛五寸多深。四日早晨，该站副站长王文轩、吴富礼发现水湿粮垛很深，还没立时通知华阴县人民政府粮食科，或动员全体职工全力抢救粮食，只是领导少数职员进行排水，装卸工人仍然继续赶卸第四个车皮上的粮食，下午，华阴县人民政府粮食科通讯员李作林到该站取灭火器时，站上才给粮食科捎话领粮。李作林又忘了通知。直延迟到五日上午九点钟后，车站才正式派人通知华阴县人民政府粮食科领粮。粮食科干部到站后，也没有积极抢救粮食；双方为粮垛上的帆布是雨前盖的还是雨后盖的纠缠了几小时之后，才开始动手抢救粮食。当华阴县人民政府粮食科发觉这批粮食是运往朝邑的粮食之后，就再没有积极进行抢救工作。结果使国家五万一千八百斤大米遭到水湿、变质和霉坏。其中全部不能吃的有两千九百四十二斤，发了霉的有三千六百九十八斤，染有霉味的有四万五千零三十斤。据计算，霉坏粮食要减价出售以及倒包费用共损失人民币三百四十八万多元。华阴车站在这次事故以前，曾经先后两次发生损坏国家面粉和粮食的事故。第一次是在去年十二月间，一百三十一袋沾有煤油气味的面粉存放在该站库房，由于保管不好，被老鼠咬破七十一袋。今年二月间，该站单纯强调车皮周转，把大批大米冒雪卸下，使五千一百七十一包大米遭水湿，损失三百一十八斤，倒包费二百五十八万元。
      此外，这几个县还发生了其他一些粮食事故，使国家粮食总共有三十二万斤和面粉五百袋遭到雨淋、水湿。
      上述一系列损坏国家粮食的事故，不但使国家在经济上遭受了损失，而且在群众中造成政治上的不良影响。群众中有的说：“我掏的好面价钱，买的湿面！”也有的说：“政府收我们的好粮，为啥卖坏粮。”但所有这些经济的和政治的损失，并没有引起有关领导和负责单位足够的重视。中共华阴县委会对华阴车站几次损坏国家粮食事故，并没采取应有的措施，只认为县上“问题不大”，又说车站不属县委领导，似乎损失国家粮食是有理由的。大荔县人民政府粮食科这次严重损坏粮食事故的具体情况，大荔县委也没检查。渭南专署粮食科在事故发生之后，只是例行公事地派人检查，向上呈文了事，也没有积极地从检查原因和责任中，想出今后杜绝或防止这类事故再发生的办法。
