How Much Rain Has Fallen This Year
Central Meteorological Observatory Joint Data Office

From January to July this year, except for March when rainfall was relatively low in most parts of the country, the remaining six months saw more rainfall than usual in most areas south of 40 degrees north latitude, with the Yangtze and Huai River basins being particularly severe. Looking at the total rainfall from January to July, several stations with the longest rainfall records in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jiujiang, Hankou, and Yueyang, have broken the highest records in decades. The total rainfall in Hankou from January to July this year reached 1843.7 millimeters (mm, also known as millimeters, 1000 mm equals 1 meter, or 3 Chinese feet deep). According to the past 61 years of records, the average annual rainfall is 1266.6 mm. The rainfall in the first seven months of this year is 577.1 mm more than the average annual rainfall, exceeding it by about 45%. In 1931, when the Yangtze River basin suffered a huge flood, the total rainfall in Hankou from January to July was only 1289.3 mm, while the rainfall during the same period this year exceeded it by about 42%. Taking Shanghai, which has the longest record period, as an example, the total rainfall from January to July this year also broke the 82-year record. As for each month, in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin, from January to February and from April to July, especially in June and July, most stations broke or approached the highest records in decades. For example, the rainfall in Yueyang in June this year was 858.9 mm, and the rainfall in one month accounted for about two-thirds of the average annual rainfall of 1340.7 mm; it was more than double the largest rainfall in June since records began, which was 401.8 mm, and more than six times the rainfall in June 1931. Another example is Suxian County, Anhui Province, where the rainfall in July this year was 961 mm, about twice the average annual rainfall of Suxian County and more than twice the highest record for June in the past.

In the first half of this year, the rainfall in the Yangtze and Huai River areas was not only heavy, but also the area of heavy rain was particularly wide. From April, the center of heavy rain gradually moved north from Guangdong and Guangxi, reaching the Huai River basin in early July, and then oscillated back and forth between the Huai River basin and the Yangtze River basin. In April, the areas with more rain were mainly concentrated in Guangdong, Guangxi, and near the Nanling Mountains. In May, the main areas with more rain moved north to Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Hunan. In June, the rainfall was mainly concentrated in the Yangtze River basin east of Yichang and north of the Nanling Mountains, including areas near the Wuyi Mountains. The heavy rain area was like a long belt, and there were 11 stations in this area where the rainfall exceeded 500 mm (the distance between each two stations was at least 100 kilometers), indicating that the heavy rain area was very extensive. In July, the areas with more rain moved north again, with the main heavy rain center in the Huai River basin and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The intensity of the heavy rain center in the Huai River basin was large and the area was wide, with 19 stations with more than 500 mm and 7 stations with more than 700 mm. Such a large-scale heavy rain had never been recorded in the Huai River basin (20 to 40 years) and had never been recorded in the Yangtze River basin (40 to 80 years). It should be pointed out that the annual rainfall in the Huai River basin is only 50% to 80% of that in the Yangtze River basin. From this, it can be inferred that the rainfall in the Huai River basin this year can be said to be the largest rainfall in a century. In July, the main heavy rain center in the Yangtze River basin was distributed in the lower reaches of the Yuan River basin and the Dongting Lake area, but the distribution of heavy rain was relatively wide, including the Han River basin and the middle and lower reaches and tributaries of the Yangtze River east of Yichang. Most of the stations exceeded the highest historical records since records began, which was one to four times higher than the normal rainfall in July.

From the above rainfall situation, we can see that this year, especially in the Yangtze River basin and the Huai River basin, the rainfall intensity is large, the scope is wide, and the duration is long. The accumulation of water underground and the absorption of water by the soil have reached saturation, so most of the subsequent rainfall flows into the rivers, causing the water level in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to exceed or remain near the highest water level in history for a long time.

Speaking of the main reasons for this year's heavy rainfall, we can see from the weather maps that the development and movement of the weather system in June and July this year and the distribution of its location have the following characteristics, which are also the main factors for the heavy rainfall in June and July this year:

1.  At around 50 degrees north latitude, near the Sea of Okhotsk and Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union, a strong and stable high pressure has been maintained for more than two consecutive months (the wind around the high pressure blows in a clockwise direction). It does not swing much eastward or westward, southward or northward. Because of its existence, the cold air coming from our northwest and Mongolia and the cold and humid ocean air from the Northwest Pacific come to the upper airspace of North and Central China. When it meets the warm and humid air from the south, it can cause disturbances and force the warm and humid air to rise. We know that the temperature of a small mass of air drops by one degree (Celsius) for every 100 meters it rises. It can be seen that the rise of air is the main factor that cools and condenses the warm and humid air into clouds and rain. Therefore, this cold air is one of the important reasons that directly promote the warm and humid air to rain.

2.  At the same time as the above-mentioned important system exists, the subtropical high pressure in the Southwest Pacific plays an important role in the weather in our country for half a year in summer. This year, its position is also more southward, especially more eastward. Therefore, the warm and humid air in the South China Sea can come to our country on a large scale, especially to the upper airspace of East and Central China, which creates a necessary condition for rainfall in these areas - a sufficient source of water vapor. To the south of this high pressure, there is a zone called the equatorial air convergence zone at about 15 degrees north latitude in the Southwest Pacific from June to October every year. This zone is the source of typhoons. This year, the position of this strip zone is also significantly more southward. Therefore, until now, no typhoons have passed through the southeast coast of our country.

The reason for the particularly heavy rainfall in the Huai River basin and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River from May to July, especially in July, is the result of the simultaneous long-term existence and interaction of the above two factors. Because the strength of their confrontation is almost evenly matched, the area where they meet changes very little. In July, the area of this confrontation only oscillated slightly in the Huai River basin and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In addition, the position of the equatorial convergence zone was southward, and no typhoons passed through the southeast coast, so this situation of cold and warm air confrontation was maintained uninterrupted for a long time. In this way, the rainwater generated by the confrontation of cold and warm air has a small range of oscillation along with the area of confrontation, so the rainfall is particularly concentrated, making the rainwater in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin particularly heavy.

In general, the weather situation this summer, especially the weather situation in July, is equivalent to the normal "plum rain" situation in the Yangtze River basin in late spring and early summer, with heavy rain and low temperatures. This situation came particularly early (about 20 days earlier) and went particularly late (almost 20 days late), and there was a symbol of possible change until July 31.

According to the existing materials, this year's weather situation is not only particularly abnormal in our country, but also particularly abnormal in many other countries in the world. For example, Japan, like our country, is also particularly rainy. The southwest monsoon in India is particularly weak this year. Some parts of Europe are particularly warm, while some parts, such as West Germany, are also particularly rainy. Why is this year's weather situation so particularly abnormal? The fundamental reason is the change in solar radiation energy, which causes abnormal phenomena in the development, movement, and location distribution of weather systems. However, because meteorological science is still very young, a satisfactory solution has not been found to this problem.

In summary, the characteristics of rainfall in the Jianghuai area this year are that the heavy rain area is particularly wide, the heavy rain period is particularly long, and the rainfall is particularly large, all of which are unprecedented in records. However, due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, thorough preparation, and organized manner, the construction of water conservancy projects over the years, flood control measures, and the mobilization of the broad masses of the people under the leadership of the People's Government to launch a heroic struggle to overcome the flood. Although there is such a severe rainfall situation, causing the largest flood in history, we can still overcome natural disasters and reduce the affected areas, fully demonstrating the superiority of the people's democratic system. On the other hand, we should fully recognize the abnormal rainfall situation this year and the seriousness of the flood threat, and we must not relax our vigilance. We must continue to work hard and fight to the end to finally overcome the flood. (Xinhua News Agency)

    今年已经下了多少雨
    中央气象台联合资料室
    今年一月到七月除了三月份全国大部分地区比较少雨外，其余的六个月，在北纬四十度以南，国内绝大部分地区，雨量都比常年为多，其中尤其以长江、淮河流域一带为严重。如以一月到七月的雨量总和来看，在长江中下游几个雨量纪录历史最长的测站中，如上海、南京、杭州、九江、汉口、岳阳等站都打破了几十年以来的最高纪录。汉口今年一月到七月雨量总和达到一八四三点七毫米（毫米又称公厘，一千毫米相当一公尺即三市尺深），而根据过去六十一年纪录，平均常年全年雨量为一二六六点六毫米，今年头七个月的雨量已比平均全年雨量多五七七点一毫米，超过约百分之四十五。长江流域遭受了巨大水灾的一九三一年，汉口一月到七月的总雨量也只有一二八九点三毫米，今年同时期雨量却超出约百分之四十二。以纪录年代最长的上海来看，今年一月到七月的总雨量也打破了八十二年的纪录。如以各个月份来看，长江中下游和淮河流域，一月到二月，四月到七月，尤其是六、七两个月，大半的测站都打破或接近几十年以来的最高纪录。例如岳阳今年六月份雨量八五八点九毫米，一个月的雨量就占常年全年平均总雨量一三四零点七毫米的三分之二左右；比有纪录以来的六月份最大雨量四零一点八毫米超过一倍还多，为一九三一年的六月份雨量的六倍多。又如安徽省宿县今年七月份雨量为九六一毫米，约为宿县常年全年平均雨量两倍为过去六月份最高纪录的两倍多。
    今年上半年在长江淮河一带不但雨量大，而且暴雨区域的范围特别广阔。从四月份起暴雨中心从两广渐向北移，到七月初就到达淮河流域，以后就在淮河流域和长江流域之间来回摆动；四月份多雨区域主要集中在广东、广西和南岭山地附近，五月份主要多雨区域北移到江西、浙江、湖南，六月份雨量主要集中在长江流域宜昌以东和南岭以北包括武夷山附近地区，暴雨区域像一条长带，在这一带内雨量超出五百毫米以上的测站共有十一站（每两站之间的距离至少有一百公里以上），可见暴雨区是很广泛的；七月份多雨区域又向北移，主要暴雨中心在淮河流域和长江中下游，淮河流域暴雨中心，强度既大，范围又广，五百毫米以上的测站计有十九站，七百毫米以上的测站计有七站。这样大范围暴雨是淮河流域有纪录以来（二十年到四十年）所未曾有过的，也是长江流域有纪录以来（四十年到八十年）所未曾有过的。应该指出的是淮河流域常年雨量只及长江流域的百分之五十到百分之八十。由此可以推知，淮河流域今年的雨量可以说是一百年中的最大的一次雨量了。七月份长江流域主要暴雨中心分布在沅江流域下游和洞庭湖区，但暴雨的分布是比较广泛的，包括汉水流域和宜昌以东的长江中下游和支流区域，大半的测站都超过有纪录以来历史上的最高纪录，比起常年七月份的降水量高出一倍到四倍左右。
    从以上的降雨情况中我们可以看出今年国内，尤其是长江流域和淮河流域，雨量强度既大，范围又广，持续时间又长，地下积水和土壤吸收水分已达饱和，因此后来的雨量绝大部分流向江河之中，以致长江中下游水位超过或长时间持续在历年最高水位附近。
    说到今年多雨的主要原因。从天气图上我们看到今年六到七月份的天气系统的发展移动以及分布的位置有以下几个特点，这些特点也是今年六到七月份多雨的主要因素：
    一、在北纬五十度左右，苏联境内的鄂霍次克海附近和贝加尔湖附近连续两个多月以来，常常维持一个强大而稳定的高压（高压四周的风是成顺时针方向吹的），它向东或向西，向南或向北来回摆动也不大，由于它的存在，使得经过我国西北和蒙古人民共和国下来的冷空气和西北太平洋上的冷而潮湿的海洋气流来到我国华北、华中的上空。当它和南来的暖湿气流相遇时，便能产生扰动并迫使暖湿空气上升。我们知道一小团空气每上升一百公尺温度就要降低一度（摄氏温度表），可见空气的上升是使暖湿空气冷却凝结成云致雨的主要作用，因此这种冷空气是直接促使暖湿空气下雨的重要原因之一。
    二、和上面一个重要系统存在的同时，对我国夏季半年的天气发生重要作用的，是西南太平洋副热带高压。今年它的位置也偏南，特别是偏东了很多。因此，我国南海的暖而潮湿的空气得以大规模来到我国，特别是华东、华中的上空，这就给这些地区下雨造成一个必要的条件——充分的水汽来源。在这个高压的南面，每年六到十月在西南太平洋上北纬十五度左右有一条名叫赤道空气辐合带，这一带是台风的生成源地，今年这条带状区域的位置也相应的显著地偏南了一些，因此，直到目前为止，我国东南沿海尚未有台风经过。
    造成今年五到七月特别是七月份淮河流域和长江中下游特别多雨的原因是以上二个因素同时长久存在和互相作用的结果。由于它们的势力的对比几乎是势均力敌的，因此它们交锋的地带变动很小。七月份这个交锋的地带仅在淮河流域和长江中下游来回有一些摆动，加之赤道辐合带位置的偏南，没有台风从东南沿海经过，因而这种冷暖空气交锋相持的局面得以长时间的无间断的维持下来。这样，由于冷暖空气交锋所产生的雨水随着交锋地带的摆动范围小，因而使雨量就特别集中，使得长江中下游和淮河流域的雨水就特别的多。
    总的说来，今年夏季的天气形势，特别是七月份的天气形势，相当于正常的春末夏初的长江流域的“梅雨”形势，雨水多，气温低。这种形势来得特别早（约早二十天左右），去得也特别迟（已经迟了快二十天了），直到七月三十一日才见有可能转变的象征。
    根据现有的材料看来，今年的天气形势不但在我国特别反常，而且在世界其他许多国家也特别反常，例如日本同我国一样也是特别多雨。印度的西南季风今年格外的弱。欧洲有些地方特别暖，同时有些地方如西德也是特别的多雨。为什么今年的天气形势会这样特别反常呢？根本的原因是太阳辐射能量的变化，致使天气系统的发展移动以及位置的分布上产生反常的现象。但是关于这个问题，因为目前的气象科学尚很年青，暂时没有得到令人满意的解决。
    总上所说，今年江淮地区降雨特点为暴雨区域特别广，暴雨时期特别长，雨量特别大，都为有纪录以来所未有。但是由于中国共产党和人民政府领导正确，准备周全，组织有方，几年来水利工程的建设，防汛工作的措施，广大人民群众在人民政府的领导下动员起来展开了战胜洪水的英勇斗争。虽然有这样严重的雨情，造成有纪录以来的最大洪水，我们仍然能够战胜自然灾害，缩小受灾面积，充分表现了人民民主制度的优越性。另一方面我们也应充分认识到今年雨情的反常情况，洪水威胁的严重，绝对不能放松警惕，必须再接再厉为最后战胜洪水而斗争到底。（新华社）
