Remarks by Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy

    The outcome of the Geneva Conference demonstrates the victory of the forces of peace and the failure of the forces of war. It also proves that our country's peaceful foreign policy, as well as the policy of establishing and developing diplomatic relations with any country based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, is entirely correct. This not only conforms to the interests of all the people of our country, but also to the interests of peace-loving people all over the world.
    These noble principles of our country's foreign policy, which were written into the Common Program in the past and are now written into the draft Constitution, represent the unanimous aspiration of our people in engaging in the great socialist construction and are implemented in all our foreign activities. Through the Geneva Conference, and with the joint efforts of the Soviet Union, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and related countries, we finally overcame various obstacles and sabotage from the United States and facilitated various agreements on restoring peace in Indochina, further easing international tensions and greatly thwarting the conspiracy of American warmongers to expand the war of aggression in Asia. During the Geneva Conference, Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, adhering to the consistent principles of our country's foreign policy, also visited India and Burma, issuing joint statements with the prime ministers of the two countries respectively, affirming the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, laying a good foundation for the establishment of collective peace in Asia, and producing a significant impact on the entire international relations, making a great contribution to the cause of world peace. All of these have been warmly welcomed and wholeheartedly supported by the people of the whole country.
    However, the American aggressive bloc is still unwilling to accept defeat, continues to be hostile to the people of our country, and continues to create tensions in Asia and the world. After the armistice in Korea and the agreement on restoring peace in Indochina were reached, it is still stepping up its collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's harassment and destructive warfare against our country's coastal areas and islands is also under the protection of the United States. Taiwan is the sacred territory of our country and will never be allowed to be occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Liberating Taiwan from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitors is the unanimous desire of the 600 million people of the country and the glorious task of our entire people. Liberating Taiwan is our sovereignty and internal affair, and the American aggressive bloc is not allowed to interfere. We are determined to intensify our efforts in all aspects to completely accomplish the liberation cause of our people, liberate Taiwan, and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. If the American aggressive bloc dares to interfere and obstruct, it will surely suffer the consequences. (Xinhua News Agency)

Remarks by Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth

    Chinese youth wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. We believe that the peaceful foreign policy consistently pursued by our Premier Zhou, the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, as well as the task of liberating Taiwan, are fully in line with the interests and demands of our people and youth.
    Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory, and we must liberate Taiwan. Liberating Taiwan is China's sovereignty and internal affair, and no country is allowed to interfere. The American aggressive bloc insists on being hostile to the Chinese people, openly and arrogantly supports and directs the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang to carry out harassment and destructive warfare against our country's borders and coastal islands, and recently has intensified preparations to conclude a so-called "bilateral treaty of common security" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, attempting to turn Taiwan into a base for the long-term American aggression against our country and expand its aggression against our country. We firmly oppose this crime of the United States destroying our country's territorial sovereignty and interfering in our internal affairs. In order to defend our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, our entire 120 million youth resolutely respond to the solemn call of the Central People's Government to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and vow to strengthen the struggle, actively work, and study hard with active actions to thoroughly complete the sacred liberation cause of our people!

Remarks by Liang Xi, Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization

    I represent the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization in wholeheartedly supporting Premier Zhou's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee.
    The victory of the Geneva Conference is a victory for the peace-loving people of the world, and also a victory for the Chinese people. The activities of the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou, both inside and outside the conference, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence adhered to, expressed the common desire of the Chinese people to love peace and promoted the success of the conference. The people of the whole country have been a hundred times strengthened in their confidence in safeguarding world peace because of the victory of the Geneva Conference and the restoration of peace in Indochina.
    Premier Zhou once again announced in his report that Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory, and that liberating Taiwan is the glorious historical task of our people. This also fully expresses the common aspiration of the Chinese people. Taiwan has always been our country's territory. In order to recover this territory from the Japanese aggressors, the people of our country, especially the people of Taiwan, have carried out a long-term bloody struggle and sacrificed the blood and lives of countless patriotic men. The American aggressive bloc and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique vainly attempt to turn Taiwan into a base for attacking our mainland and endangering the collective peace and common security of Asia and the world. The Chinese people must shatter this criminal conspiracy and liberate Taiwan.
    The people of Taiwan under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are looking forward to liberation day and night. Many scientific workers who are forced to stay in Taiwan also hope to return to the people's motherland, reunite with their families and relatives, and serve the construction of the motherland. The messages they have relayed through various channels reveal their infinite affection for the motherland. In order to stifle the people's progressive demands, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has destroyed all patriotic activities, and even academic groups such as the Scientific Workers Association have been persecuted and destroyed. However, the will of the Taiwanese people to love the motherland is unshakable, and the belief of scientific workers in the truth is also unshakable. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is about to perish, and the wishes of the Taiwanese people to break away from the reactionary rule and of the scientific workers to return to the embrace of the motherland will surely be realized.
    All members of our Association for Science and Technology Popularization are willing to contribute all our strength to the glorious historical task of liberating Taiwan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    拥护周总理兼外长的外交报告
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦的谈话
    日内瓦会议的结果，说明了和平力量的胜利和战争势力的失败，也说明了我国的和平外交政策以及根据平等、互利和互相尊重领土主权的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系的政策，是完全正确的，这不仅符合于我国全体人民的利益，也符合于全世界爱好和平的人民的利益。
    我国的外交政策的这种崇高的原则，过去写在共同纲领上，现在又写在宪法草案上，是我国人民在从事于伟大的社会主义建设中的一致愿望，并贯彻在我国的一切对外活动中。通过日内瓦会议，在苏联、越南民主共和国及有关国家的共同努力下，我们终于排除了美国方面的种种阻挠和破坏，促成了关于恢复印度支那和平的各种协议，使国际紧张局势得到更进一步的缓和，并大大挫败了美国好战分子企图在亚洲扩大侵略战争的阴谋。在日内瓦会议期间，周恩来总理兼外长又本着我国外交政策的一贯方针，访问印度与缅甸两国，与两国总理分别发表联合声明，肯定了和平共处的五项原则，为建立亚洲的集体和平打下良好的基础，并对整个国际关系产生重大的影响，对世界和平事业作了伟大的贡献。所有这些，都受到全国人民的热烈欢呼和衷心拥护。
    但是，美国侵略集团仍然不甘心失败，继续与我国人民为敌，继续制造亚洲和世界的紧张局势。在朝鲜停战和恢复印度支那和平获得协议之后，它还在与蒋介石卖国集团加紧进行勾结。蒋介石卖国集团对我国沿海地区和岛屿进行骚扰性的和破坏性的战争，也是受到美国的庇护。台湾是我国神圣的领土，决不容许蒋介石卖国集团盘踞。把台湾从蒋介石卖国贼的统治下解放出来是全国六万万人民的一致愿望，也是我们全国人民的光荣任务。解放台湾是我们的主权和内政，决不容许美国侵略集团加以干涉。我们决心从各方面加紧努力，来彻底完成我国人民的解放事业，解放台湾和消灭蒋介石卖国集团。美国侵略集团如果敢于加以干涉和阻挠，必将自食恶果。　（新华社）
    中华全国民主青年联合会主席廖承志的谈话
    中国青年衷心拥护周恩来总理在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上的外交报告。我们认为周总理所提出的我国所一贯奉行的和平外交政策，互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则以及解放台湾的任务，是完全符合我国人民和青年的利益和要求的。
    台湾是中国神圣不可侵犯的领土，我们一定要解放台湾。解放台湾是中国的主权和内政，决不容许任何国家来干涉。美国侵略集团坚持与中国人民为敌，公开地、狂妄地支持和指使蒋介石残余匪帮对我国边境和沿海岛屿进行骚扰性的和破坏性的战争，近来更加紧准备与蒋介石匪帮缔结所谓“共同安全双边条约”，企图使台湾变为美国长期侵略我国的基地，扩大对我国的侵略。美国这种破坏我国领土主权、干涉我国内政的罪行，我们是坚决反对的。为了保卫我国主权和领土的完整，我们全国一亿二千万青年，坚决响应中央人民政府解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的庄严号召，誓以积极的行动，加强斗争，积极劳动，努力学习，为彻底完成我国人民的神圣解放事业而奋斗！

    中华全国科学技术普及协会主席梁希的谈话
    我代表中华全国科学技术普及协会衷心拥护周总理在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上的外交报告。
    日内瓦会议的胜利是全世界爱好和平的人民的胜利，也是中国人民的胜利。以周总理为首的中国代表团在会内和会外的活动和所坚持的各国和平共处的五项原则，表达了中国人民热爱和平的共同愿望，促进了会议的成功。全国人民因日内瓦会议的胜利，印度支那和平的恢复，百倍增强了维护世界和平的信心。
    周总理在报告中又一次宣布了台湾是中国神圣不可侵犯的领土，解放台湾是我国人民光荣的历史任务，这一点也完全表达了中国人民的共同愿望。台湾从来就是我国领土。为了从日本侵略者手中收回这块领土，我国人民特别是台湾人民进行了长期的流血斗争，献出了无数爱国志士的鲜血和生命。美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团妄想把台湾变成进攻我国大陆的基地，危害亚洲与世界的集体和平和共同安全。中国人民一定要粉碎这种罪恶的阴谋，一定要解放台湾。
    在蒋介石卖国集团统治下的台湾人民，日夜企待着解放。被迫羁留在台湾的许多科学工作者，也都希望能回到人民的祖国，与家人亲戚相团聚，并为祖国的建设服务。他们曾经辗转传来的消息，流露出眷念祖国的无限深情。蒋介石卖国集团为了扼杀人民的进步要求，对于所有的爱国活动均加以摧残，甚至像科学工作者协会这样的学术团体也受到迫害和破坏。可是台湾人民爱祖国的意志是不可动摇的，科学工作者爱真理的信念也是不可动摇的。蒋介石卖国集团就要灭亡，台湾人民脱离反动统治和科学工作者回到祖国怀抱的愿望定会实现。
    我们科学技术普及协会的全体会员愿为解放台湾这一光荣的历史任务，贡献出所有的力量。
