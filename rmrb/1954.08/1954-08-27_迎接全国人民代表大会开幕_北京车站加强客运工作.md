To welcome the convening of the National People's Congress and National Day, the Beijing Railway Bureau is actively strengthening passenger transport work.

On August 11th, the Beijing Railway Bureau, the Beijing Transportation Branch Bureau, and the Beijing Station established a joint "Special Transport" office to coordinate with relevant units to ensure that representatives to the National People's Congress and foreign guests arriving in Beijing can board their trains promptly. It was also decided to assign skilled personnel as train attendants for sleeping cars and soft-berth cars and to prepare food according to the habits of foreign guests on the passenger cars they use. To ensure passengers' safety and comfort during their journey, the Beijing Railway Bureau inspected sleeping cars, dining cars, and soft-berth cars, promptly repairing any substandard areas. The Passenger Transport Department plans to conduct a general training for passenger transport staff before the end of September, providing education on regulations and service attitude so that they can better serve passengers.

From August 7th to 12th, Beijing Station staff participated in voluntary labor during their spare time, conducting a thorough cleaning and disinfection inside and outside the station. Weeds were completely removed from the station square garden and platform gutters. The waiting room was thoroughly disinfected, and glass and various facilities were cleaned. Curbs and walls were also whitewashed.

Dozens of train crew groups in the Beijing Train Section launched a labor competition to improve their work. The Train Section purchased a large number of special publications, records, and recreational supplies to distribute to various trains. The international train between Moscow and Beijing also ordered special publications suitable for international friends to read, providing them for passenger reading.

    迎接全国人民代表大会开幕
    北京车站加强客运工作
    北京铁路管理局为了迎接全国人民代表大会的召开和国庆节，积极加强客运工作。
    八月十一日北京铁路管理局和北京运输分局、北京车站成立了“专运”联合办公室，开始和有关单位联系，保证来京的全国人民代表大会代表和外宾们及时乘车。并决定配备业务熟练的人员担任卧车、软席车的列车员，在外宾乘坐的客车上，根据他们的习惯准备食品。为了保证旅客在旅行中安全舒适，北京铁路管理局检查了卧车、餐车和软席车，对不合标准的地方及时进行了修整。客运处准备在九月底以前，对客运工作人员普遍进行一次训练，进行规章和服务态度的教育，使他们更好地为旅客服务。
    从八月七日到十二日，北京站职工参加了业余义务劳动，在车站内外做了一次彻底大清扫和消毒工作，把车站广场花园和站台沟道各处的杂草全部拔净，在候车室彻底消毒，玻璃和各种设备都擦洗干净，道沿、墙壁也刷白了。
    北京列车段几十个乘务组为改进工作展开了劳动竞赛。列车段采购了大量专刊、唱片和文娱用品分发给各次列车，莫斯科—北京间的国际列车还订购了适合国际友人看的专刊，供应旅客阅读。
