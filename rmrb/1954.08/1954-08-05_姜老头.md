The fishing boats of the Red Star Fishery Production Cooperative in Jin County, Lüda City, have set out to sea again. Old member Jiang Maoxing stood at the bow of the boat, rowing the scull, feeling an indescribable joy in his heart. The sea was so calm, and from afar, only the green waves of Dalian Bay could be seen. The fishing grounds were not close to the shore, but because the boat was rowed quickly, they arrived in no time. As soon as they entered the net gate, the people on the boat began to nervously fold the net. Someone then opened their throat and sang loudly:
	“Comrades, get ready, let's start fishing, let's work together!”
The net was laid out like a maze, its mouth wide open, waiting for the fish to come in.

Gradually, in the fishnet under the sea, a hazy white object appeared. The people on the boat worked hard to fold the net. Closer, closer, to the head of the fish bag, thousands of fish were tumbling in the net, stirring up countless waves and foam.

A dozen people worked together, and in no time the net was pulled up.

Jiang Maoxing looked at the baskets of gleaming ribbonfish in the sunlight and thought, "The fishery production cooperative plans to complete 2.26 million catties of fish this year, and it has completed more than 70 percent in just half a year. If we were working individually, we couldn't catch so much fish in several lifetimes!" He also thought, "The Communist Party has such foresight, telling us to take the road of collectivization; now, it is included in the draft constitution."

It was not a simple matter for Old Jiang to understand this.

In February of last year, the cooperative expanded to absorb new members. This was truly a top priority in the village. Jiang Maoxing's son, Jiang Jide, heard the news and ran home in one breath, excitedly saying to his father, "Dad, the cooperative is so good, let's join!" Old Man Jiang was on the kang, and he closed his eyes and did not answer. After a long while, the old man opened his eyes and said slowly, "You! You're still missing a trick. Don't just pick the good things to think about. You have little experience, and you get jealous when you see cooperative members getting a little more benefit. Who can predict what the cooperative will be like this year or next year? With so many people together, if we can't catch fish, won't we starve?"

These words did not suppress the emotions churning in Jiang Jide. He was young, enthusiastic, and pursued new things. These days, he was constantly thinking: he still went out to sea with his father when the sky was full of stars every day, and came back in the dark at night. After working hard all year, the income was still not as good as that of the cooperative members. When lying in bed, he wondered:
	"Why have so many people's hearts changed for the better after joining the cooperative?" Several times, his family's small boat was left in the water and could not be pulled ashore. When the cooperative members saw it, they quickly helped pull it up. He asked himself, "Why do so many people, who used to be as ignorant as I was, know so much after joining the cooperative?"

These days, the old man was also thinking, "The family's situation has only turned around in the last two years. Why take that risk by joining the cooperative?" Jiang Maoxing had a hard life. He went out to sea with his father at the age of fourteen, without enough to eat or wear. At the age of twenty-one, he left home to fish in Qingdao, Korea, Yantai, Laizhou, and Xiong Yue, and after working for half his life, he never wore a piece of clothing without patches.

In recent years, grain prices have stabilized and fish prices have increased. Old Jiang saw that his fishing gear was increasing year by year, and his back straightened up.

He thought, "I use my own hands to build my 'empire'. If I continue like this, I can live a steady life, more and more happily every day. Why should I join the cooperative and take that risk?"

The son knew his father's stubborn temper and didn't say much, joining the cooperative on his own.

Jiang Maoxing packed up his fishing gear and boat, teamed up with his brother and nephew, and continued to work as before.

This year, the village underwent great changes.

One day, Old Man Jiang returned from fishing and passed by the shack where Su Qingsheng lived. He saw a lot of wood and stones piled up outside, so he ran in to take a look. A child saw the visitor and happily pointed to the wood, saying, "New house, new house!" This child was so skinny a few years ago that he was all skin and bones, but now he was plump and jumping around like a calf. Old Jiang looked at the kang and saw that everything was new. Old Su's wife's eyes were shining as she said, "Everything has changed. The family bought this and that last year, and the child is also going to school. Thinking about it, it's just the shack that's shabby. We plan to build a few new houses to live in."

It wasn't just Old Su's family like this. This year, more than twenty tile-roofed houses were built in the poor mountain gullies of Jiangjunshi Village, and many thatched houses were renovated into tile-roofed houses. And those who built and renovated these houses were all members of the cooperative. Since Old Jiang could remember, he had never seen so many houses built in the village at once.

The old man was still holding his breath with his son about joining the cooperative, and didn't want to ask too much. But seeing that the cooperative was getting better and better every day, he couldn't help but secretly inquire from the older members of the cooperative.

Every day, Old Jiang passed by the net field and saw the members working happily together, discussing how to cast the net. The old man knew that this was not a simple matter. In the past, people often fought over whether you cast the net high or I cast it low, arguing until their faces were red and their necks were thick, and sometimes even hurting their feelings over this.

One evening, Old Jiang saw several female members of the agricultural production team sorting out fishnets on the beach. "What's going on?" he asked curiously. The women explained, "There's not much work in the fields these days, and the work at sea is busy, so we came over; when it's busy with farming, the people on the boat also go to the fields."

These words reminded the old man of his family's land. He often worried about not being able to take care of both ends. When it was busy with work at sea and also busy with work in the fields, he had to leave the work in the fields to his wife, who was an amateur at farming.

One night, he heard his son say, "Today, the net-folding team caught more than 40,000 catties of fish. If we weren't organized and exchanged fishing experience, how could we have caught so much!"

When the New Year was approaching that year, the cooperative absorbed new members again. The son went home again to mobilize his father. Although the old man was a little tempted, there were still some things he couldn't bear to part with. For a few nights, after dinner, Old Jiang ran alone to his own few acres of land outside the door and stood there in a daze. He didn't say a word, and no one knew what he was thinking. They only saw him sometimes grab a handful of soil from the ground, put it near his nose, and refuse to put it down for a long time.

The son didn't understand his father's thoughts, but just said, "Dad, you should have seen clearly this time! Not to mention anything else, just take the average output of our fishing group's five sampans, which exceeds the average output of the best Shao You Tang fishery mutual aid group in the same village by more than 20 percent."

Jiang Jide spoke for a long time, but his father still didn't say a word.

Old Jiang was too lazy to talk to anyone. He stood in the field outside the door in a daze all day long. He thought: he was almost sixty years old, and he still had a big sore on his foot. Was he going to spend his whole life in the wind and waves? When people get old, it's more reliable to grow crops. He also thought: before liberation, when he passed by other people's fields and saw the green sorghum and millet, he thought: how great it would be if he could eat the grain grown in his own field! "Land is really the lifeline!" His thoughts returned to his current few acres of land. When Jiang Maoxing's father was alive, he left him five acres of land. Jiang Maoxing treated the land like his own son, taking care of it from morning to night. But life got worse and worse, and he couldn't make ends meet. After his father died, he left behind a debt. He had no choice but to sell the land with tears in his eyes. He thought: after liberation, he finally bought a piece of land, and now he was going to take the land to the cooperative. Wasn't this like cutting a piece of flesh from his body?

Seeing that his father always ignored him, the son thought of his uncle. The two old brothers might be able to talk out their inner thoughts, so he invited his uncle over.

The old man got along well with his brother after all, and he poured out all his thoughts at once. It turned out that he not only thought the land was precious, but also had many other thoughts. He said, "You can't pick anything in the cooperative, it's all assigned, how can you stand it! Besides, the cooperative often holds meetings, either criticizing or self-criticizing. I can't stand being told off in person."

The old man thought about this and that, but he couldn't make up his mind.

The son thought that Zhou Zhenyuan, the director of the cooperative, was the deputy secretary of the Thirteenth District Party Committee, and he would definitely have a solution. That night, Comrade Zhou Zhenyuan came. Old Jiang was lying on the kang. When he saw Director Zhou coming, he reluctantly got up to greet him.

Director Zhou spoke first: "How has your health been recently? The harvest this year is good, right!" Naturally, the topic turned to the matter of joining the cooperative.

"At this time, we should make a good comparison." Director Zhou continued, "Although we have talked to everyone in the past, we haven't talked enough, so some people still don't understand many things about the cooperative today. Regarding the issue of division of labor, the cooperative has always been: the elderly do light work, and young people do heavy work."

Director Zhou's words hit Old Jiang's heart.

"As for fishing gear and land, although they are shares, the ownership still belongs to you. If you don't want to stay in the cooperative, you can take them out." Zhou Zhenyuan said meaningfully, "Our cooperative has also taken a lot of detours. When the cooperative was first established, I hadn't come here yet. You know the situation at that time better than I do. At that time, there were some people in the cooperative who only contributed money but not labor. Before long, the county knew about this. Do you remember? The county magistrate personally came to our village to change the cooperative charter. From then on, the cooperative took the right path. Later, the district party secretary came constantly. What is this for? It's all for the sake of making everyone live a good life."

The old man didn't say a word, only feeling the veins on his forehead throbbing wildly, his mind churning like the sea.

"You have probably seen a lot of facts in the past two years about whether the cooperative is good or bad." Director Zhou still said in a cautious and slow tone, "This year, the cooperative's public accumulation fund is more than 400 million yuan. Everyone plans to buy two 40-ton sailing ships to fish in the ocean, and they also want to use 200 million yuan to buy a net-folding net. Do you think you can buy so many things by working individually?"

A few days later, Old Jiang heard that his brother and nephew had decided to join the cooperative. More than 60 percent of the population in the whole village had joined the cooperative.

One day in February, Jiang Jide returned from fishing. As soon as he entered the door, he saw his father packing up fishing nets and fishing lines. When the old man saw him coming in, he turned his face to one side and said embarrassedly, "Take these things to the cooperative, and take the small boat too. Just say I want to join the cooperative. I... I'm too embarrassed to go myself." The old man joined the cooperative, but he didn't take his few acres of land with him.

Old Jiang paid attention to the cooperative's land every day. One day, he even found time to go to the field to take a look. He saw that the men and women of the agricultural production team, no matter whose land they were hoeing, were working equally hard. When they were busy, they didn't even bother to drink a sip of water.

The old man felt a burning pain in his heart. "How selfish I am!" In April, he ran to the cooperative and said that he had decided to put the land into the cooperative as well.

One day in July, the net-folding team members held a scoring meeting. As usual, the meeting was very lively. This one said, "Let me say a few words..." That one said, "Let me talk too..." When it was Old Jiang's turn, as soon as his name was mentioned, someone in the meeting proposed, "Comrade Jiang Maoxing has performed well in his work these days. He should be raised from thirteen points to fourteen points..." Before the words were finished, everyone applauded, expressing their approval.

Old Jiang had been coming home late these days. Several times, he passed by the cooperative office in the middle of the night and saw the lights inside still burning brightly. The members were sitting under the lights, discussing enthusiastically, one sentence after another. He heard someone say, "The draft constitution stipulates that the state protects the property of cooperatives, encourages, helps, and guides the development of the cooperative economy." Another person said, "Only by greatly developing the cooperative economy can everyone's life be better." Then he heard someone ask, "Can we install machines on the cooperative's big sailboat next year? Will the cooperative add a steamboat this autumn?"

Old Jiang listened with fascination. He recalled the days he had spent this year and felt that he had taken the right path! He thought, "After they finish studying, they should lead the people of the whole cooperative to study; I must study the constitution carefully!"

    姜老头

    旅大市金县红星渔业生产合作社的渔船又出海捕鱼了。老社员姜茂兴站在船头上摇着橹，心里真有说不出的痛快。海面是那么平静，远远望去，只见大连湾一片绿波。渔场离岸边不算近，可是因为船摇得快，没一会就到了。一进网门，船上的人就开始紧张地折网。不知谁这时放开喉咙大声地唱开了：
    “同志们哪，准备好哪，开始打鱼了哪，咱们一起干哪！”
    网摆得就像个迷魂阵似的，张着大口，等着鱼群进来。
    渐渐地，在海水下的鱼网里，有一种朦胧的白色的东西出现。船上人使劲地折网。近了，近了，到了鱼包头了，成千条鱼在网中翻腾，激起无数的浪花和泡沫。
    十来个人一齐动手，不一会就把网拉上来了。
    姜茂兴望着船上那一篮一篮在太阳光下闪耀的刀鱼，他想：“渔业生产合作社今年计划要完成的二百二十六万斤鱼的任务，只半年就完成了百分之七十以上。要是单干，几辈子也打不了这么些鱼呀！”他又想：“共产党看得真远呀，叫我们走合作化的道路；现在，又在宪法草案里给订了一条。”
    老姜能体会到这一点，可真不是件简单的事情。
    去年二月天，合作社扩大吸收社员。这在村里可真是件头等重要的大事。姜茂兴的儿子姜际德听到这消息，就一口气跑回家，兴致勃勃地对父亲说：“爹，合作社多好，咱们入社吧！”姜老头正在炕头上，他把眼睛一闭，没有答腔。过了好一阵，老头才睁开眼睛慢吞吞地说：“你呀！还缺一个心眼，作事不能尽拣好的想。你见识少，看到合作社社员多得一点好处就眼红了，谁能料到合作社今年、明年会怎么样？那么多人在一块，要是打不到鱼，不是要饿肚子吗？”
    这几句话并没有把儿子姜际德翻腾的感情压下去。他年青热情，追求新鲜事物。这几天，他成天在盘算着：自己每天还是满天星星的时候就和父亲一块出海，夜里摸黑回来，忙了一整年，所得还是赶不上合作社的社员。躺在床上时，他又捉摸：
  “为什么好多人入了合作社心眼都变好了？”有几次，他家的小船搁在水里，拉不到岸上来，叫合作社的社员看见了，连忙帮着拉上来。他问自己：“为什么好些人过去和我一样啥也不懂，入社后就懂得那么多？”
    老头这些天也在想：“家里的光景好容易这两年翻过来啦，何必去合作社冒那个险呢？”姜茂兴是苦过来的人，他十四岁上就和父亲出海，吃不上，穿不上。二十一岁离家到青岛、朝鲜、烟台、莱州和熊岳等地去打鱼，混了半辈子，没穿过一件不打补钉的衣裳。
    这几年粮价稳了，鱼价提高了。老姜眼见自己手里打鱼的家什一年比一年多，腰板子也就硬起来了。
    他想：“我用自己的双手打‘天下’，照直下去，光景可以过得稳稳扎扎，一天比一天称心，为什么要去参加合作社，冒那个险呢？”
    儿子知道父亲的牛性子脾气，也就不再多说，独自个入了合作社。
    姜茂兴收拾收拾自己的渔具和渔船，跟哥哥、侄子搭伙，仍照老样子干。
    这一年村里又起了很大的变化。
    一天，姜老头打鱼回来，走过苏庆升住的窝棚，看见外面堆了不少木料和石头，就跑进去看。一个孩子见来客了，高兴得指着木料说：“住新房，住新房！”这孩子前几年还瘦得皮包骨头，现在胖起来了，又蹦又跳，活像个小牛犊。老姜往炕上一瞧，见铺的盖的全是新的。老苏的女人眼睛闪着光说：“一切变了。家里去年这一年买这买那，孩子也上学了。想想，就是窝棚住的窝囊，打算盖几间新房住住。”
    不只老苏一家这样，这一年将军石村的穷山沟沟里，盖了二十多间瓦房，还有好些草房改修成瓦房。而这些盖房和修房的，又都是合作社社员。老姜从能记事的时候起，也没见过村里一下子盖这么多房子。
    老头为入社的事，和儿子还憋着口气，不愿多问。但见合作社一天比一天有起色，也忍不住私下里向年纪大的社员打听。
    老姜每天赶网场走过，看见社员在一起干的挺欢，大伙一道商量着下网。老头知道这事儿可不简单。早先人们常为你下网下的高，我下的低，争得脸红脖子粗，有时还为这伤了感情。
    一天傍晚，老姜见海滩上有几个农业生产队的女队员在整理鱼网捣线。“这是怎么回事？”他好奇地走过去问。那几个妇女忙解释说：“这两天地里没啥活，海上的活忙，我们就过来了；农忙的时候，船上的人也到地里去。”
    这话使老头想起自家的地。他常为了两头顾不过来伤脑子。碰到海上的活紧，地里的活也紧时，只好把地里的活扔给老婆，而老婆种地是个外行。
    一天晚上，他听儿子说：“今天折网队打了四万多斤鱼。要不是组织起来，交流打鱼经验，那能打得这么多！”
    那年快过新年时，合作社又吸收新社员。儿子回家又去动员父亲。老头虽然有点动心，但还有些东西舍不得。有几天晚上，一吃过夜饭，老姜就独自个跑到门外自家的那几亩地上站着发呆，他不啃声，没有人知道他在想什么，只见他有时从地上抓起一把土，放在鼻子边，好久好久不肯放下。
    儿子不明白父亲的心思，只是说：“爹，这回你总该看清楚啦！不讲别的，光拿我们钓鱼组五只舢板船的平均产量来说，比同年同村最好的邵有堂渔业互助组的平均产量超出了二成多。”
    姜际德讲了半天，父亲还是不啃气。
    老姜谁也懒得搭理。成天一个人站在门外的地里发愣。他想：自己是快六十岁的人了，脚上还长着个大疮，难道一辈子风里来，浪里去？人老了，还是种庄稼来得靠实。他又想起：解放前走过人家的地里，看见绿油油的高粱、谷子时，他就想：多咋自己能吃自己地里打的粮食就好啦！“地真是命根子啊！”他的思想又回到眼下的这几亩地来。姜茂兴的父亲在世的时候，曾给他留下五亩地。姜茂兴对地就像对自己的儿子一样亲，一天到晚收拾。可是日子却越过越糟心，糊不住嘴，他父亲死后，又拉下一身饥荒（债务的意思），没办法，流着眼泪把地卖了。他想；解放后，好容易买了块地，现在要把地也带到合作社，这不是要从我身上割一块肉吗？
    儿子见父亲老是不搭理，就想起伯父来，老哥儿俩许能把心里话谈出来，于是他就把伯父请过来。
    老头到底是和哥哥谈得来，一下子就把心里的话统统倒出来了。原来，他不只觉得土地贵重，还有很多别的想头。他说：“社里什么事都不能拣，全是派，咋受得了！再说，社里常开会，不是批评，就是检讨，当面挨说，我还吃不消。”
    老头想这想那，总下不了决心。
    儿子想起，合作社主任周振元是十三区区委副书记，一定会有办法。当天晚上，周振元同志来了。老姜正躺在炕上，见周主任来了，勉强起身打招呼。
    周主任先开腔：“你身体最近怎么样？今年的收成不错吧！”很自然地，话头扯到入社的事情上。
    “在这种时候，是应该好好比较比较。”周主任接下去说：“我们过去虽然和大家谈了，但谈的还不够，所以有些人到今天对合作社还有许多地方不明白。关于分工的问题，社里一向是：年纪大的作轻活，年轻人干重活。”
    周主任的话，句句都打在老姜的心眼子上。
    “至于说渔具和土地，虽然入股了，但所有权还是自个的，不高兴在社里呆下去，还可以拿出来。”周振元讲到这里，意味深长地说：“咱这个合作社也走了不少弯路啦，合作社刚成立时，我还没来这儿，当时的情形你比我知道得还清楚，那阵社里有帮人，他们只出钱不出力。没多久，这事就被县里知道了。你记得吗？县长亲自到了咱村里，改社章，打这，社里才走了正道。以后区委书记就不断地来。这为的是什么呀！都是为的叫大伙都过好日子。”
    老头没吱声，只觉得额头上的青筋突突地乱跳，脑子里像海水一样翻腾着。
    “合作社是好是坏，这两年恐怕你也看了不少的事实了。”周主任仍旧用持重缓慢的语调说：“今年社里的公积金有四亿多元，大伙打算买两条四十吨的大帆船，到远洋去打鱼，还想用二亿元买盘折网。你想，单干能买这么些东西吗？”
    过了没几天，老姜听说哥哥和侄子都决定入社了。全村有百分之六十多的人口都入了社。
      二月里，有一天，姜际德打鱼回来，一进门看见父亲在收拾鱼网鱼线。老头见他进来，把脸偏在一边，难为情地说：“你把这些东西拿到合作社，小船也带去，就说我要入社。我……我自己没脸去。”老头入了社，但他那几亩地没有带去。
    老姜成天留意合作社的地，有一天，他还找了个空到地里瞧了瞧，他见农业生产队的男男女女，不论是锄那家的地，都一样地卖劲。活忙时，他们连水都顾不得喝一口。
    老头觉得心里毛辣火热地难过。“我咋这么自私！”四月里，他跑到社里说，他决定把地也入社。
      七月间的某一天，折网队队员开评分会。像往常一样，会议进行得很热烈。这个说：“我来说两句……”那个说：“我也来讲讲……”轮到老姜了，刚提出他的名字，会场上就有人提议：“姜茂兴同志这些时工作表现得不错，他应由十三分提到十四分……”话还没落点，大伙就鼓掌，表示赞成。
    老姜最近几天回家很晚。有好几次，他半夜走过合作社办公室，见里面的灯还点得通亮通亮。社员们坐在灯下，你一句我一句讨论得真热烈。他听见有人说：“宪法草案上规定了国家保护合作社的财产，鼓励、帮助和指导合作社经济的发展。”另一个人说：“只有大大发展合作社经济，大家的生活才能过得更好。”接着他又听见有人问：“咱们社的大风船上明年可以不可以安上机器？今年秋天社里是不是添汽船？”
    老姜听得入了神，他回忆起这一年来自己所过的日子，觉得自己的路是走对啦！他想：“他们学完了，就该领导全社的人学习了；我一定要好好学宪法！”
