    Urban savings in Hebei Province are increasing daily. By the end of July, urban savings deposits throughout the province reached 245.8 billion yuan, an increase of 50.4% compared to the end of July 1953, and more than 51 times the figure at the end of 1949. The number of depositors has also gradually increased. By the end of June, there were 374,008 fixed and current savings accounts alone, an increase of 66,964 compared to the end of 1953. In Baoding City, more than half of the employees in many work units participate in savings, and in some units, the proportion of participants reaches as high as 90%.

    In order to facilitate deposits and withdrawals for depositors, People's Banks in various cities and towns in Hebei Province have added many small savings institutions, adjusted business hours, and implemented continuous shifts or duty shifts. People's Banks in many areas have also hired activists to assist in carrying out savings work. According to statistics from Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Xuanhua, Baoding, Qinhuangdao, Zhangjiakou, and the Fengfeng Mining Area, People's Banks have hired more than 3,200 people to assist in organizing and mobilizing the masses to participate in savings. Units such as the China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company Hebei Provincial Company, through the active promotion and organization by personnel assisting in savings work, and by handling pre-deposit registrations, have seen deposit amounts gradually rise from 10% of the total monthly salary to over 30%. To further encourage the masses to deposit, the Hebei Branch of the People's Bank of China has decided to launch a prize-winning savings plan for lump-sum withdrawals from installment savings in various cities starting from October 1st.

    河北省城市储蓄额日益增加
    河北省各城镇人民踊跃参加储蓄。到七月底止，全省城市储蓄存款有二千四百五十八亿元，比一九五三年七月底增加百分之五十点四，比一九四九年年底增加五十一倍多。存款户数也逐渐增加，仅定期和活期储蓄户，在六月底已经有三十七万四千零八户，比一九五三年年底增加六万六千九百六十四户。保定市不少单位都有半数以上的职工参加储蓄，有的单位参加储蓄人数的比例高达百分之九十。
    河北省各城镇人民银行为了便利储户存款和取款，增设了许多小型储蓄机构，调整了营业时间，实行了连带上班制或值班制。许多地区的人民银行还聘请了一些积极分子协助开展储蓄工作。据唐山、石家庄、宣化、保定、秦皇岛、张家口六市和峰峰矿区的统计，人民银行已经聘请三千二百多人协助组织和动员群众参加储蓄。中国花纱布公司河北省公司等单位，经过应聘协助开展储蓄工作的人员积极宣传、组织，并办理预储登记，存款额已经由每月薪金总数的百分之十逐渐上升到百分之三十以上。为了进一步鼓励群众存款，中国人民银行河北省分行决定从十月一日起在各市举办零存整付有奖储蓄。（魏锟山）
