Ambassador Mononutu's Speech at the Reception

Today, the Indonesian government and the Indonesian people are celebrating the ninth anniversary of independence.

Currently in Indonesia, although opinions diverge among all political parties, there is a sacred goal that unites them, and that is to maintain the freedom of our country. "Once free, forever free" has become the slogan of national unity for all Indonesians.

We recognize that our country, like many other countries in Southeast Asia, is still a young country, still has many shortcomings, and is materially backward, especially in the economic field. Therefore, we Indonesians have gained a second common ground, which is that we must unite to strive for prosperity based on social justice.

The two goals I have mentioned have become two important factors in promoting national unity in Indonesia.

The Indonesian nation, like the Chinese nation, has been liberated from all the shackles of imperialism through a mass revolution.

Like the Indonesian nation, the Chinese nation is also moving towards complete economic prosperity.

I believe that this commonality will surely become a powerful foundation for the friendship and unity between the two nations of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia.

In order to achieve the common goals of our two countries, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia should strive to maintain and consolidate their friendly relations.

The Indonesian art troupe currently in Beijing was invited by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Indonesian government accepted this invitation and sent them to represent the art of our Indonesian nation. The Indonesian government firmly believes that in the current fierce political struggle, cultural understanding between nations can also promote understanding between nations in other aspects.

I firmly believe that the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indonesian nations are not only of great significance between our two countries, but also play a far-reaching role in enhancing understanding among Asian countries and in striving for world peace.

The Indonesian nation, like other Asian nations, faces immortal world peace with firm confidence. I firmly believe that the Chinese and Indonesian nations are fundamentally like-minded in their desire for peace.

For the above reasons, as we celebrate the ninth anniversary of the declaration of Indonesian national independence in the Chinese capital, I would like to end my speech with my conviction: I firmly believe that the friendship and unity between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia will be further consolidated, which is not only for the benefit of the two nations, the Chinese and Indonesian, but also for the benefit of the whole world; we must strive to achieve our common goals, for lasting world peace.

Now let us raise our glasses to the health of Chairman Mao, to the health of all members of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and to the prosperity of all the Chinese people. (Excerpt from Xinhua News Agency)

    莫诺努图大使在招待会上的讲话
    在今天，印尼政府和印尼全国人民都在庆祝独立第九周年的纪念日。
    目前在印尼，一切政党中意见虽然分歧，可是有一个神圣的目标使他们团结一致，那便是保持我们国家的自由。“一旦自由，永远自由”，已成了全印尼民族团结的口号。
    我们承认，我们的国家，正如在东南亚许多其他国家一样，还是一个年青的国家，仍有许多缺点，我们物质方面还是落后的，特别是在经济方面，因此，我们印尼民族又获得了第二个共同的立场，那就是我们要团结起来为创造以社会法制为基础的繁荣而奋斗。
    我所说的两个目标，它们已成了促进印尼民族团结一致的两个重要因素。
    印尼民族，正如中华民族一样，已经从一切帝国主义的束缚中，以群众性的革命取得了解放。
    如同印尼民族一样，中华民族也面向着完备的经济迈进。
    我相信这一个共同点，一定能成为中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国两个民族之间友谊和团结的有力的基础。
    为实现我们两国的共同目标，中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国，应该努力维持并巩固他们之间友好的关系。
    目前在北京的印尼艺术团是由中华人民共和国中央人民政府所邀请来的，也是印尼政府接受了这种邀请而派来的，他们代表我们印尼民族的艺术。印尼政府深信，在目前剧烈的政治斗争中，民族间文化的谅解，也能促进民族间在其他各方面的谅解。
    我深信，中华民族和印尼民族之间的友好关系，不仅在我们两国间含有重大的意义，就在增进亚洲各国间的谅解上，以及在争取世界和平上，也能起远大的作用。
    印尼民族，正如其他亚洲民族一样，以坚决的信心，面向着不朽的世界和平。我深信在渴望和平上，中华民族和印尼民族是根本志同道合的。
    由于以上原因，在中国首都我们庆祝宣布印尼民族独立第九周年的纪念时，我要以我的信心来结束我的演讲：我深信中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国之间的友谊和团结，将能更巩固起来，这不仅是中华民族和印尼民族两国间的利益，也是为全世界的利益；我们要为达到我们共同的目标，为世界的永久和平而奋斗。
    现在我们为毛主席的健康，为中华人民共和国中央人民政府各位的健康，以及为全中国人民的繁荣而干杯。　（据新华社的摘要）
