Our Experiences Learning from Soviet Textbooks
Beijing University History Department, World History Teaching and Research Section

    Correcting Our Attitude Towards Learning
      Our process of learning from Soviet textbooks has been a process of ideological struggle. In this process, the majority of our teachers have gone through three stages: (1) a stage of resistance, a lack of humility in learning; (2) a stage of passive learning to complete teaching tasks; (3) finally, a stage of actively, humbly, and diligently studying Soviet textbooks. Due to differences in individual levels, the degree of understanding of the superiority of Soviet textbooks also varies, and the timing of the transition also differs; however, there is a common point: this transition is the result of continuous ideological struggle—due to teaching practice and the gradual improvement of ideological levels, it gradually changed from being unable to accept to believing that it is necessary to learn humbly.
      What hindered us from learning the advanced experience of the Soviet Union humbly from the beginning? The most important reason is that our position, viewpoint, and methodology have not changed, and this is manifested in academic thinking as a lack of clarity in the distinction between the enemy and ourselves. We were skeptical of Soviet historical science and still had many attachments to bourgeois historical science. The ideological situation of each person was different at the time. Some teachers said: "The characteristics of Soviet historical science can also be found in European and American bourgeois historical science. For example, Green was already talking about the history of the British people in the nineteenth century, Beard also used a class perspective to analyze the American Constitution, and Bell has always advocated comprehensive research." Some teachers said: "Soviet textbooks quote a sentence from Marx here and a sentence from Stalin there, which is no different from 'The Book of Songs says' and 'Confucius said'." Some teachers said: "It is intellectually impossible to accept the idea of forcibly portraying the ancient Orient, with its small number of slaves, as a slave society."
    This was the ideological situation in the early days of Liberation. Soon, teachers' political studies began, followed by the participation of most comrades in the land reform, and some comrades also participated in the translation work of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. All comrades participated in the "Three-Anti" and Sincere Honesty Movement. This series of political movements basically changed the teachers' political stance, and thus, the teachers' academic thinking also underwent a certain degree of change. The reorganization of departments and faculties further directly promoted teachers to study Soviet teaching syllabi and textbooks. At the beginning of this stage, although teachers' attitude towards Soviet textbooks was relatively humble, their learning was still not very in-depth, and their understanding of Soviet textbooks was mostly superficial. However, in the process of specifically applying Soviet textbooks, teachers gradually understood their advantages, discovered that they could solve many difficulties in teaching, thereby greatly improving teaching quality, and thus gradually turned to seriously learning Soviet advanced science.
    Through a year of teaching practice after the reorganization of departments and faculties, theoretical and professional issues that were previously unfamiliar or even completely unfamiliar have gradually become familiar. Some teachers have been able to reach fairly correct conclusions on individual issues through independent thinking and can initially criticize bourgeois historical viewpoints. Some teachers have had the opportunity to learn the latest achievements of Soviet historical science from translating Soviet textbooks or directly listening to lectures by Soviet experts. This has led to the current stage of actively and humbly studying Soviet textbooks.
    Main Gains in Learning
      In learning the advanced historical science of the Soviet Union, we have different degrees of experience and gains from different angles and through different channels; now, we will only cite some examples related to the textbooks we have encountered, in terms of ancient history, medieval history, modern history, and Soviet history.
      (1) Marxist-Leninist historical science has grown and consolidated in the struggle against bourgeois historical viewpoints. Therefore, Marxist-Leninist historical science must occupy positions on all fronts and not allow bourgeois historical viewpoints to find any gaps. Ancient history is one of the fronts in this battle. In ancient history, one of the most reactionary tendencies of the bourgeoisie is to modernize ancient history. Denying the regularity of social development is a basic characteristic of bourgeois scholars. This characteristic is manifested in ancient history as denying that the slave system is one of the specific stages of social development, believing that feudalism and capitalism already existed in ancient times, and that "capitalism" and "civilization" are synonymous, and that the elimination of capitalism means economic and cultural regression. Representatives of this school of thought include the German Meyer and Rostovtzeff, who fled to the United States after the Great October Socialist Revolution. This reactionary "historical cycle theory" had a certain degree of influence on us in the past.
      Only after studying Soviet textbooks did we realize that the biggest theoretical error of the "historical cycle theory" is to confuse the "commune" system that remained in the early stages of slave society with the feudal system, to confuse commodity production in slave society with capitalist commodity production, and to believe that capitalism is the pinnacle of human civilization. In this way, they objectively become defenders of the interests of monopoly capitalists. From Soviet textbooks, we learned that the basic characteristics of ancient Oriental societies are: "commune" organizations still remained, but the status of "commune" members was very different from that in primitive society, and they suffered from severe labor service and tax exploitation by state institutions; on the other hand, the slave system was increasingly developing, becoming an important component of the economic base. The number of slaves may not have been large, but judging from the nature of the regime and the trend of the development of the slave system, this was undoubtedly a slave society. Soviet scholars' theory on the social structure of the ancient Orient clarified a problem that had been extremely confused by bourgeois scholars, making Egyptology and Assyriology truly scientific for the first time.
    From Soviet textbooks, we also learned that commodity production in slave society is by no means capitalist commodity production. The former is based on slave labor, while the latter is based on wage labor. Slaves themselves are commodities, but the labor power of slaves is not a commodity; the labor power of wage laborers is a commodity, but the laborers themselves are not commodities. Due to this fundamental difference, the commodity economy in slave society can only develop to a considerable height in a certain period and a certain region, and it is impossible to develop to the height reached by commodity production in the capitalist era. In this way, Soviet historians shattered the fallacy of the "historical cycle theory" and determined that the first period of class society was the slave society period, where there was neither feudalism nor capitalism.
    (2) Another advantage of Soviet textbooks is reflected in the precision and completeness of their scientific system. As far as medieval history is concerned, the Soviet teaching syllabus clearly states that medieval history is mainly the history of the origin, development, and collapse of feudalism. This is essentially different from the chaotic and contradictory views of bourgeois historians on medieval history. They have never been able to provide a scientific explanation of feudalism. As already pointed out earlier, some people believe that Egypt and Babylon already had a feudal system, while others say that European feudalism only occurred in the eighth and ninth centuries. Some even deny that Britain, Russia, and some Oriental countries ever had a feudal system. Therefore, they cannot point out its specific content for medieval history, and they cannot even agree on the chronological limits.
    From the Soviet medieval history textbooks, it can be seen that the West European centrism of European and American bourgeois historians is extremely reactionary. In the British bourgeois historian's pride, the Cambridge Medieval History, in all eight volumes and one hundred and eighty-seven chapters, only seventeen chapters talk about Eastern Europe and Asia, and only one chapter talks about Russia. Robinson's history textbook, which was popular in the United States and reprinted many times, simply talks about Western Europe, as if Eastern Europe and Asia are beneath consideration. This historical fabrication that obliterates the historical status of other nations and the contributions of various peoples to world culture is deliberately creating a theoretical basis for attempts and actions to invade other nations, and thus is a serious threat to the desire for peaceful coexistence of mankind.
    From Soviet textbooks, we also recognize that the people are the true creators of history. Bourgeois historians either do not mention the uprisings of the people who shook feudalism in the Middle Ages, such as the Jacquerie uprising and the German Peasants' War, or slander them from the standpoint of the ruling class. In their history, the great role of the masses of the people in promoting historical progress cannot be seen. Only Soviet textbooks written from the standpoint of the working people give due importance to the history of the heroic struggles of the exploited classes against the exploiting classes in the Middle Ages.
      (3) Marxist-Leninist classics have given many instructions on historical issues in various periods, especially on issues of modern history. Soviet historians attach great importance to their instructions, understand their spirit, and do not understand them in a dogmatic way. For example, Stalin, Kirov, and Zhdanov made comments on the modern history outline in 1934, believing that it would be better for modern history textbooks to start from the French Revolution. However, after the Patriotic War, Soviet modern history textbooks for universities and middle schools all began with the British bourgeois revolution; can it be said that Soviet historians violated Stalin's instructions? It cannot be said so. Because Soviet historians understand that the basic spirit of Stalin's opinion is to take the formation of capitalist relations as the beginning of modern history, and they have found in scientific practice that it is more appropriate to start the narration of modern history from the British bourgeois revolution.
    Classical writers sometimes express opinions on historical events with specific purposes. Soviet historians do not understand these opinions only literally. For example, Lenin once said: During the Jacobin dictatorship, the National Convention was a dictatorship of the lower classes, that is, the lowest levels of the urban and rural poor. But we know that the Jacobin dictatorship was a revolutionary bourgeois dictatorship formed by an alliance between the bourgeoisie and the broad masses of the people. It should be understood that Lenin did not want to give a scientific definition of the Jacobin dictatorship at the time. He was facing a practical task—fighting the Mensheviks. He was expressing his opinion on the issue of the alliance between the proletariat and the peasants, so he emphasized one aspect of the Jacobin dictatorship. This was completely correct; and emphasizing the role of the lower classes in the French Revolution at that time had great practical significance.
    Sometimes, the classical writers' discussion of an event in a certain historical period is correct, but applying it to a similar event in another historical period becomes outdated. Soviet historians' attitude towards such discussions is dialectical, not metaphysical. For example, Marx and Engels believed that the Slavic national unity movement of 1848-1849 was counter-revolutionary, which does not mean denying the progressive significance of all Slavic national movements in history. In terms of the situation in 1848-1849, Tsarist Russia was playing the role of "European gendarme." If the Slavs had formed an alliance with Tsarist Russia at that time, it would have strengthened Tsarist Russia's power and weakened the revolutionary forces in Germany. Marx and Engels judged the nature of the Slavic national movement at that time from the perspective of whether it was conducive to the proletarian movement, which was completely correct. But later historical conditions changed, and the movement of the Slavic people to get rid of foreign oppression should be regarded as a democratic and progressive movement. This is how Soviet historians dialectically treat historical issues. Therefore, we deeply realize that Soviet historical science is not dogmatic. It uses scientific methods to deal with historical issues, and it is constantly developing.
      (4) From the Soviet middle school textbook "A General History of the Soviet Union," we have obtained many examples and guiding principles for writing textbooks. First of all, we could not understand the title "A General History of the Soviet Union," because the establishment of the Soviet Union is a modern event, and its history should not be written from ancient times. At the time, we did not realize that it was not a history of the Soviet period, but a history of all the nationalities within the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is not a history of Russia, but must be a history of the Soviet Union. In every era, the history of each nationality occupies an appropriate proportion. At the same time, when dealing with national issues, the progressive role of merging backward ethnic regions is not denied because of the aggressiveness of Tsarist Russia's rule; conversely, national movements against Tsarist rule should be evaluated separately according to the essence of each movement, and not all such movements have progressive significance.
    Secondly, the history of economic development is the foundation of every era. The editors use concrete historical facts and illustrations to explain the economic situation of each era, and the description of social development theory only occupies a secondary position. The status of cultural history is very prominent, with a section in almost every period. Obviously, a history lacking cultural history is not a comprehensive history. Moreover, pointing out the cultural contributions of one's own people at any time is an indispensable part of patriotic education. Similarly, the role of Russia in world history, whether it is the dynasty, the masses of the people, or even individuals, is appropriately explained. The situation in countries neighboring Russia, especially Europe, is described to a certain extent in every era, indicating that Russia did not develop in isolation.
    The evaluation of figures is entirely determined by his historical era and historical role: it is of course important to emphasize the leaders of peasant movements; for emperors who played a major role, while pointing out their brutality, they also point out their progressive role. The status of Peter the Great goes without saying, and even the reign of Ivan IV, known as "Ivan the Terrible," occupies a chapter, and it is affirmed that due to his rule, the Russian state ended its feudal division and became a unified and powerful country, sufficient to defend against foreign enemies.
    Finally, and most importantly, is the constant revision of Soviet history textbooks. We realize that these revisions are due to two reasons. One is that new research results must be used to correct outdated statements, especially after Stalin published his papers on linguistics and Soviet socialist economic issues. Such revisions are particularly urgent. The second is that due to changes in the international political situation, the existing achievements of scientific research must be used in a timely manner to make appropriate additions and deletions in certain parts, so that historical science becomes a more effective weapon of struggle. This is enough to show that Soviet historical science is constantly developing, and it is closely linked to the current political struggle.
    Experiences and Shortcomings in Learning
    From the above-mentioned bits and pieces of experience and gains, we have the following understanding of the advantages of Soviet history textbooks and historical science:
    (1) Soviet historical science has developed in a sharp struggle with bourgeois historical falsifiers; therefore, we deeply realize that learning from Soviet textbooks is inseparable from criticizing the corrupt historical viewpoints of the bourgeoisie.
      (2) Soviet historians use the Marxist-Leninist classics as a guide for studying history; therefore, a correct understanding of Soviet textbooks is inseparable from studying the Marxist-Leninist classics, and the method of learning should be creative, not dogmatic.
      (3) Soviet textbooks are constantly developing and absorbing the latest research results; therefore, learning from Soviet textbooks is inseparable from scientific research.
    (4) Soviet textbooks are closely coordinated with current politics, and they serve the political struggle; therefore, learning from Soviet textbooks is inseparable from caring about current politics and improving political vigilance.
    However, at present, there are still many shortcomings in our learning of Soviet advanced science:
    First of all, we are currently still at the stage of understanding Soviet textbooks in a piecemeal and not comprehensive and fundamental way. This situation is manifested in: we have only learned the methods of dealing with individual historical events and figures, but when we want to use this method to deal with another type of event and figure, we often feel difficult, at least feel no confidence.
    Second, the second shortcoming related to this is dogmatism. Since we still cannot comprehensively and fundamentally understand Soviet textbooks, in order to complete teaching tasks, we have to make appropriate analyses for problems that have not yet been considered mature, and the result is often only dogmatic explanations. In addition, the problem of using citations of classical works to replace the analysis of concrete facts cannot be avoided.
    Third, we have not done enough in combining the study of Soviet textbooks with the actual situation in China. At present, we have only managed to point out the events that are related between Chinese and foreign history in the same period, and to supplement some materials from Chinese historical books. As for which parts of the Soviet textbooks should be increased or decreased, how to clarify the position of Chinese history in world history in order to instill patriotic education, and how to thoroughly Sinicize Soviet textbooks based on Chinese history and reality and the level of Chinese students, these issues have not been considered mature. Fourth, there is still a shortcoming of not being able to delve into the learning methods, which is related to the lack of collective discussion. The reason is that although the lecture notes compiled by the lecturers of each course after studying Soviet textbooks have also been passed around and discussed, the colleagues in the teaching and research section have different majors, so they do not have the conditions to conduct in-depth discussions on the problems raised by the lecturers. Therefore, they cannot fully study and repeatedly debate the arguments and statements in the Soviet textbooks, so that they truly become a part of themselves.
    Finally, there are not many of us who can fluently read Soviet textbooks and papers in Russian, and some have not even started learning Russian, which is a major obstacle to further learning from the Soviet Union.
    Direction of Future Efforts
    The above-mentioned shortcomings show that at present, on our path to learning from the Soviet Union, the most important link should be to move from fragmented and piecemeal experiences and gains to fully mastering the spirit and essence of Soviet textbooks. Partial perceptual knowledge is necessary, but we must never stay at this stage. Only by mastering the spirit and essence of Soviet textbooks can we overcome the problem of treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts, can we remedy the shortcoming of not being able to move an inch without crutches, can we avoid dogmatic swallowing, can we flexibly combine with the actual situation in China, and can we creatively learn from the Soviet Union.
    We believe that in order to further grasp the spirit and essence of Soviet textbooks, we must first strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism. In the past two years, we have initially used the viewpoints and methods of Marxism-Leninism to analyze history, but with a strong "bookwormishness," we still cannot look at problems from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism at all times, and we are still somewhat rigid in connecting with reality. Therefore, strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism is the most fundamental and urgent task. The second is to continue to criticize the corrupt historical viewpoints of the bourgeoisie. Experience has shown that the depth of criticism of the corrupt historical viewpoints of the bourgeoisie is directly proportional to the depth of understanding of Soviet textbooks. "If the old does not go, the new will not come"; the seemingly right but actually wrong statements of bourgeois historians are still unconsciously affecting us. In the future, we should not only expose the fabrications of bourgeois historians on individual issues, but also smash the corrupt historical viewpoints from the entire ideological system. The third is to carry out scientific research and discussion. We have recognized that Soviet historical science is constantly progressing and developing, not static. In order to catch up with the development of Soviet historical science, it is not enough to simply study textbooks. We must study and discuss the latest scientific achievements of the Soviet Union; it is also not enough to simply accept ready-made conclusions. We must conduct creative research so as to test our ability to analyze concrete historical facts with Marxist-Leninist methods through scientific practice. Only through special research and discussion can we deepen our understanding of Soviet textbooks. The fourth is to step up Russian learning. In order to directly read Soviet textbooks, as well as further read Soviet historical works and papers, we must draw up a plan and gradually improve our Russian level.

    我们学习苏联教材的体会
    北京大学历史系世界史教研室
    端正学习的态度
      我们学习苏联教材的过程是一个思想斗争的过程。在这个过程中，我们多数教师，都经过这么三个时期：（一）抗拒，不虚心学习的时期，（二）为完成教学任务而转入被动学习的时期，（三）最后达到主动地、虚心地、努力钻研苏联教材的时期。各人的水平不同，领悟苏联教材优越性的程度也各有深浅，转变的时期也有迟早之别；可是有一个共同之点：这种转变，是不断进行思想斗争的结果——由于教学的实践和思想水平的逐渐提高，才逐渐由不能接受而转变到认为必须虚心学习。
      究竟什么阻碍了我们从一开始就虚心地学习苏联的先进经验？最主要的是由于立场、观点、方法没有改变，表现在学术思想上便是敌我界限不清。对苏联历史科学怀疑，对资产阶级历史科学还有许多留恋。各人当时的思想情况各有不同。有的教师说：“苏联历史科学的特点也可以在欧美资产阶级历史科学中找到，如格林早在十九世纪时就在讲英国人民的历史，毕尔德也曾用阶级观点分析美国宪法，贝尔一向提倡综合研究。”有的教师说：“苏联教科书中这里引一句马克思的话，那里引一句斯大林的话，和‘诗云’‘子曰’没有什么区别。”有的教师说：“硬把奴隶数目不多的古代东方说成是奴隶社会，思想上怎么也想不通。”
    这是解放初期的思想情况。不久就开始了教师的政治学习，接着大部分同志参加了土地改革，个别同志还参加了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的翻译工作，全部同志参加了“三反”和忠诚老实运动。这一系列的政治运动基本上改变了教师的政治立场，从而教师的学术思想，也有了一定程度的转变。院系调整更直接推动教师去学习苏联的教学大纲和教材。在这一阶段的开始，教师对苏联教材的态度虽然已比较虚心，可是学习仍然不很深入，对于苏联教材的体会很多是表面的。但是，在具体运用苏联教材的过程中，教师逐步了解了它的优点，发现它能解决教学上的许多困难，从而大大地提高了教学质量，因此逐渐转向于认真学习苏联的先进科学。
    通过院系调整后一年的教学实践，过去不大熟悉的、甚至完全不熟悉的、有关理论和业务上的问题，现在逐渐熟悉起来。有的教师通过独立思考已能在个别问题上得到相当正确的结论，且能初步批判资产阶级的历史观点。有的教师更有机会从翻译苏联教材或直接听苏联专家讲课中学习苏联历史科学的最新成就。这样就到达目前积极地、虚心地钻研苏联教材的阶段。
    学习中的主要收获
      在学习苏联先进的历史科学中，我们从不同的角度，通过不同的途径，有着不同程度的心得和收获；现在只就我们所接触的教材，按上古史、中世纪史、近代史和苏联史等方面举出一些实例来说明。
      （一）马克思列宁主义的历史科学是在跟资产阶级历史观点进行斗争中成长并巩固起来的。因此，马克思列宁主义的历史科学必须在各个战线上占据阵地，不让资产阶级的历史观点找到任何空隙。上古史是这场战斗中的战线之一。在上古史中，资产阶级最反动的倾向之一是把上古史现代化。否认社会发展的规律性是资产阶级学者的基本特点，这种特点在上古史上的表现，便是否认奴隶制度是社会发展的特定阶段之一，认为封建制度和资本主义制度在古代即已出现，“资本主义”和“文明”是同义语，资本主义的消灭即意味经济和文化的倒退。这个学派的代表人物有德国的迈尔和在伟大的十月社会主义革命后逃亡到美国的罗斯托夫采夫等。这种反动的“历史循环论”在过去对我们有一定程度的影响。
      只有在我们学习了苏联教材以后，才知道“历史循环论”在理论上的最大错误是把残留在奴隶制社会初期的“公社”制度和封建制度混为一谈，把奴隶制社会中的商品生产和资本主义商品生产混为一谈，并认为资本主义是人类文明发展的顶点，这样，他们在客观上便成为垄断资本家利益的辩护人。从苏联教材中我们才了解，古代东方社会的基本特征是：“公社”组织还残留着，但“公社”成员的地位和原始社会时的比较已大不相同，他们遭受着国家机构严重的劳役和赋税剥削；另一方面，奴隶制已日益发展，以至成为经济基础的重要构成部分之一。奴隶的数目可能不很多，但从政权的性质来看，从奴隶制发展的趋向来看，这无疑的是奴隶社会。苏联学者关于古代东方社会结构的学说澄清了一个被资产阶级学者弄得极为混乱的问题，使埃及学和亚述学第一次成为真正的科学。
    从苏联教材中，我们也了解奴隶制社会中的商品生产决非资本主义商品生产。前者是建立在奴隶制劳动的基础上，而后者则建立在雇佣劳动的基础上。奴隶本身是商品，但奴隶的劳动力不是商品，雇佣劳动者的劳动力是商品，但劳动者本身不是商品。由于这种基本的区别，奴隶制社会中的商品经济只能在一定时期、一定区域发展到相当高度，决不可能发展到资本主义时代商品生产所达到的高度。这样，苏联历史学者便粉碎了“历史循环论”的谬说，确定了阶级社会的第一个时期是奴隶制社会时期，这里既没有封建主义，也没有资本主义。
    （二）苏联教材的另一优点表现在它的科学体系的精密和完整上。就中世纪史而论，苏联的教学大纲中明确地提出：中世纪史主要是封建主义的起源、发展和崩溃的历史。这和资产阶级的历史家关于中世纪史的混乱的、自相矛盾的看法有着本质的区别。他们对于封建主义始终不能作出科学的解说。正如前面所已指出的，有人认为埃及、巴比仑已经有了封建制度，同时又说欧洲的封建主义从八九世纪才发生，甚至有人否认英国、俄国和若干东方国家曾有封建制度，因而对于中世纪史不能指出它的具体内容，而对于它的年代断限的说法，更不能一致。
    从苏联中世纪史的教材可以看出欧美资产阶级历史家的西欧中心论是极端反动的。英国资产阶级历史家引以自豪的剑桥中世纪史，在全书八册一百八十七章中，讲到东欧和亚洲的，只有十七章，讲到俄国的，只有一章。美国风行一时、翻印多次的罗滨孙的历史课本，干脆只讲西欧，对于东欧和亚洲仿佛不屑一顾。这种抹煞其他民族历史地位和各族人民对于世界文化的贡献的历史伪造，实在是有意为侵略其他民族的企图和行为制造理论根据，因而对于人类和平共处的愿望是严重的威胁。
    从苏联教材中我们又认识到人民是历史的真正创造者。资产阶级历史家对于中世纪的人民震撼封建主义的起义运动如札克雷起义，德意志农民战争等，或者根本不提，或者站在统治阶级的立场加以诬蔑，在他们的历史中看不到人民群众推动历史前进的伟大作用。只有站在劳动人民立场编写的苏联教材，才把中世纪时期被剥削阶级反抗剥削阶级的英勇斗争史给以应有的重视。
      （三）马克思列宁主义的经典著作对于各时期的历史问题，尤其是近代史的问题，有过不少的指示，苏联历史学家很重视他们的指示，体会其精神实质，而不是作教条主义的了解。例如斯大林、基洛夫、日丹诺夫在一九三四年对近代史纲要提出意见，认为近代史教科书从法国革命开始比较好。但是在卫国战争以后，苏联大、中学近代史教科书都从英国资产阶级革命写起；能否说苏联历史学家违背了斯大林的指示呢？不能这样说。因为苏联历史学家体会斯大林的意见的基本精神是以资本主义关系的形成作为近代史的开端的，他们在科学实践中发现近代史的叙述如从英国资产阶级革命开始是更合适些。
    经典作家有时带着特定的目的对历史事件发表意见，对于这类意见，苏联历史学家并不只从字面上去了解。例如列宁曾经说：雅各宾专政时期国民会议是下层分子的专政，即城市和乡村的贫民中最下层的专政。但是我们知道，雅各宾专政是资产阶级和广大人民群众结成联盟的革命资产阶级的专政。应该了解，列宁当时并不想对雅各宾专政下
  一个科学的定义，他所面临的是一个实际任务——和孟什维克作斗争，他是就无产阶级和农民联盟的问题发表意见，因此着重强调雅各宾专政的一个方面，这是完全正确的；而在当时强调法国革命中下层人民的作用是有很大的现实意义的。
    有时候，经典作家对于某一历史时期的某一事件的论述是正确的，但将其应用到另一个历史时期的类似事件就变为过时的了。对于这类论述，苏联历史学家的态度是辩证的、不是形而上学的。例如马克思、恩格斯曾认为一八四八——一八四九年的斯拉夫民族统一运动是反革命的，这并不等于否定历史上一切斯拉夫民族运动的进步意义。就一八四八——一八四九年的情况说，沙俄正在扮演着“欧洲宪兵”的角色，当时斯拉夫人如果和沙俄结成联盟，就会加强沙俄的力量，而削弱了德意志的革命力量。马克思、恩格斯从是否有利于无产阶级运动的角度来判断当时斯拉夫民族运动的性质，这是完全正确的。但是后来的历史条件改变了，斯拉夫民族人民力图摆脱外国压迫的运动应该被视为民主的进步的运动。苏联历史学家就是这样辩证地对待历史问题的。因此，我们深切体会到苏联的历史科学不是教条主义，它运用科学的方法来处理历史问题，它是不断向前发展的。
      （四）从苏联中学教本“苏联通史”中，我们获得不少编写教材的范例和指导原则。首先，书名“苏联通史”原是我们所不能理解的，因为苏联的建立是现代的事，其历史不当从古代写起。我们当时并没有体会到，它并不是苏联时期的历史，而是苏联境内各民族的历史，因而它不是俄国史，必然是苏联史。在每一个时代中，各民族的历史都占有适当的比重。同时在处理民族问题时并不因为沙俄统治的侵略性而否认合并落后民族地区的进步作用；反之，反沙皇统治的民族运动应从各个运动的本质分别予以评价，并非一切这类运动都有进步意义。
    其次，经济发展史是每个时代的基础，编者用具体史实并借插图来说明每一时代的经济情形，有关社会发展理论的陈述只占次要地位。文化史所占的地位很突出，几乎每一个时期都有一节。很显然，缺少文化史的历史就不是全面的历史，何况随时指出本国人民在文化上的贡献正是爱国主义教育不可缺少的部分。同样，俄国在世界史上所起的作用，无论是王朝的，人民群众的，甚至个人的，都适当地予以说明。与俄国相邻诸国，尤其是欧洲的局势，在每一个时代中都有一定程度的叙述，以示俄国并非孤立地发展的。
    关于人物的评价，完全依他的历史时代和历史作用来决定：农民运动领袖的着重提出是当然的；对起重大作用的帝王，在指明其残暴的同时，仍指出其进步作用。彼得大帝的地位自不待说，就是号称“伊凡雷帝”的伊凡四世朝也占有一章篇幅，并且肯定：由于他的统治，俄罗斯国家才结束封建割据之局，而变成一个统一而有力量的国家，足以防御外敌。
    最后，而且也是最重要的一点，就是苏联史教本的随时修改。我们体会这类修改是由于两个原因，一是由于必须利用新的研究成果来改正过时的说法，特别是在斯大林发表关于语言学和苏联社会主义经济问题的论文以后，这类修改是特别迫切的。其次是由于国际政治情况的变化，必须及时利用科学研究的已有成果在若干部分作适当的增删，使历史科学成为更有效的斗争武器。这正足以说明苏联历史科学是不断发展的，它和现实政治斗争是紧密地联系着的。
    学习中的体会和缺点
    从以上点滴的心得和收获中，我们对于苏联的历史教材和历史科学的优点有下列几点体会：
    （一）苏联历史科学是在和资产阶级历史伪造者作尖锐斗争中发展起来的；因此，深刻体会到学习苏联教材是和批判资产阶级的腐朽历史观点分不开的。
      （二）苏联历史学家以马克思列宁主义的经典著作作为研究历史的指南；因此正确了解苏联教材是和学习马克思列宁主义经典著作分不开的，而学习的方法应该是创造性的，不是教条主义的。
      （三）苏联教材是在不断发展中的，它吸收了最新的研究成果；因此，学习苏联教材是和科学研究分不开的。
    （四）苏联教材是和现实政治密切配合的，它是为政治斗争服务的；因此，学习苏联教材是和关心现实政治、提高政治警惕性分不开的。
    然而，目前我们在学习苏联的先进科学中，还存在着许多缺点：
    首先，我们目前还停留在枝枝节节地，而不是全面地、根本地领会苏联教材的阶段。这种情况表现在：我们只学会了对于个别历史事件和人物的处理方法，但是要运用这种方法去处理另一类型的事件和人物往往感到困难，至少感到没有信心。
    第二，与此相关联的第二个缺点就是教条主义。既然还不能全面地、根本地领会苏联教材，为了完成教学任务，对于尚未考虑成熟的问题又不能不作适当的分析，结果往往只能教条主义地说明一番。此外，以引证经典著作代替具体事实分析的毛病也还不能避免。
    第三，在学习苏联教材和结合中国实际方面，我们还做得很不够。目前只做到将同时期中中外历史有联系的事件指出，另外补充一些中国史籍中的材料。至于苏联教材中何者宜增宜减，如何阐明中国史在世界史中的地位，借以灌输爱国主义教育，如何根据中国的历史和现实以及中国学生水平把苏联教材彻底中国化，这些问题都未考虑成熟。第四，在学习的方法上还存在着不能深入的缺点，这和集体讨论不够是有关系的。原因是各课主讲人在钻研苏联教材后所编的讲义，虽然也经过传观和讨论，但因教研室同人所专攻的时代不同，没有条件对主讲人提出的问题作深入讨论，因此对苏联教材中的论点和提法不能进行充分学习和反复争辩，使它真正成为自己的一部分。
    最后，我们能利用俄文流利地阅读苏联教材和论文者还不多，有的甚至尚未开始学习俄文，这对进一步学习苏联是一大障碍。
    今后努力的方向
    以上这些缺点说明，目前在我们学习苏联的道路上，最主要的环节应该是从零碎枝节的心得和收获进入全面掌握苏联教材的精神实质。局部的感性认识是必要的，但是决不能停留在这个阶段。只有掌握了苏联教材的精神实质才能克服头痛医头、脚痛医脚的毛病，才能补救离开拐杖就寸步难移的缺点，才能避免生吞活剥的教条主义，才能灵活地结合中国实际，才能创造性地学习苏联。
    我们认为，要进一步掌握苏联教材的精神实质，首先必须加强马克思列宁主义的学习。两年来，我们已初步运用马克思列宁主义的观点、方法来分析历史，但是带有浓厚的“书呆子习气”，还不能时时刻刻从马克思列宁主义的观点来看问题，在联系实际上还嫌生硬。因此，加强马克思列宁主义的学习是最根本的、最迫切的任务。其次是继续批判资产阶级腐朽的历史观点。经验证明：对于资产阶级腐朽的历史观点的批判的深度是和了解苏联教材的深度成正比的。“旧的不去，新的不来”；资产阶级历史学家的似是而非的说法还在不知不觉中影响着我们。今后不仅要在个别问题上揭露资产阶级历史家的捏造，还应从整个思想体系上粉碎腐朽的历史观点。第三是开展科学研究和讨论。我们已认识苏联历史科学是在不断进步的、发展的，不是一成不变的。为了赶上苏联历史科学的发展，单学习教材是不够的，必须学习和讨论苏联最新的科学成就；单接受现成的结论也是不够的，必须进行创造性的研究，这样才能通过科学的实践来检验自己以马克思列宁主义的方法分析具体历史事实的能力。也只有通过专题研究和讨论才能加深我们对于苏联教材的认识。第四是加紧俄文学习。为了直接阅读苏联教材，以及进一步阅读苏联历史著作和论文，必须订出计划，逐步提高我们的俄文水平。
