    The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army convened the Third All-Army Youth Work Conference from July 28th to August 6th. The conference summarized the experience of youth work in the entire army since entering Korea and determined the tasks of youth work in the future.

    In the more than three years of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the New Democratic Youth League organizations of the Volunteer Army's various units and organs have continuously developed under the leadership and care of the Party committees and political organs at all levels.

    In the past three years, a high tide of revolutionary heroism has been set off in the Volunteer Army. The vast number of Youth League members and young commanders and fighters fought bravely and worked actively during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and successfully completed various combat missions. A large number of heroic and model figures with outstanding achievements emerged. Among the Youth League members in the entire army, more than 70,000 have been credited with meritorious service, of which 89 members have won the glorious title of Second-Class Hero or Second-Class Model or above, truly achieving "where there are young people, there is the heroic and exemplary role of young people." After the Korean armistice, the Volunteer Army implemented Chairman Mao's instructions of "good health, good study, and good work" put forward during the Second National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of China, mobilizing Youth League members to lead the vast number of young people to quickly plunge into a learning upsurge, and achieved excellent results. In the learning tests, the Youth League members generally scored above 80 points. In some companies, the average score of Youth League members reached 99 points, and many outstanding Youth League members also served as "little teachers," mutual aid group leaders, or study tutors. In order to work and study better, Youth League members also motivated young people to actively participate in the company's cultural and recreational activities and sports and hygiene movements, enhancing the health of the troops.

    Through continuous political and ideological education and actual struggle, the socialist consciousness of the vast number of Youth League members has been generally improved. In the past three years, outstanding Youth League members who joined the Communist Party of China accounted for 61.4 percent of the total number of Party members developed during the same period. The Youth League has become the core organization for uniting and educating the vast number of young people under the leadership of the Party, and has become the Party's most effective assistant and most reliable reserve force.

    During the conference, Yang Yong, Deputy Commander of the Volunteer Army, and Li Zhimin, Deputy Political Commissar, spoke at the meeting. In his speech, Li Zhimin put forward that the main tasks of the Volunteer Army's youth work in the future are: under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, to continue to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's "three goods" instructions, to thoroughly implement the publicity and education of the general line and general tasks, to continue to strengthen the organizational construction of the Youth League in connection with the central tasks of the troops, and to consolidate and improve the combat effectiveness of the Youth League. He called on the youth of the entire army to continue to work hard, maintain honor, promote honor, be doubly vigilant, strictly guard their positions, and strive unremittingly to defend the socialist construction of the motherland and to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

    志愿军政治部召开全军第三届青年工作会议
    中国人民志愿军政治部在七月二十八日到八月六日召开了全军第三届青年工作会议。会议总结了入朝以来全军的青年工作经验，确定了今后青年工作的任务。
    在三年多来抗美援朝斗争中，志愿军各部队各机关的新民主主义青年团组织，在各级党委、政治机关的领导和关怀下得到了不断的发展。
    三年多来，志愿军各部队兴起了高涨的革命英雄主义运动。广大的青年团员和青年指挥员战斗员，在抗美援朝战争期间英勇战斗，积极工作，出色地完成了各项战斗任务，出现了大批功绩卓著的英雄模范人物。在全军青年团员中，已有七万多人立了功，其中有八十九名团员获得了二级英雄或二级模范以上的光荣称号，真正作到了“那里有青年那里就有青年的英雄模范作用”。朝鲜停战后，志愿军各部队贯彻了毛主席在中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会期间提出的“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示，发动青年团员带领广大青年迅速投入了学习高潮，获得了优良的成绩。在学习测验中，青年团员的成绩一般都在八十分以上，有的连队里青年团员们的平均成绩达到九十九分，许多优秀的青年团员还担任了小先生、互助组长或学习辅导员。为了更好的工作和学习，青年团员们还带动青年积极地参加了连队的文化娱乐活动和体育卫生运动，增强了部队人员的健康。
    广大青年团员经过不断的政治思想教育和实际斗争的锻炼，社会主义觉悟已普遍提高。三年多来优秀的青年团员加入中国共产党的占同一时间党员发展总数的百分之六一点四，青年团已成为党领导下的团结教育广大青年的核心组织，成为党最得力的助手和最可靠的后备力量。
    会议期间志愿军副司令员杨勇、副政治委员李志民先后到会讲话。李志民在讲话中提出志愿军今后青年工作的主要任务是：在各级党委的领导下，继续深入贯彻毛主席的“三好”指示，深入贯彻总路线总任务的宣传教育，结合部队中心任务继续加强青年团的组织建设，巩固提高青年团的战斗力。他号召全军青年要继续努力，保持荣誉，发扬荣誉，加倍警惕，严守阵地，为保卫祖国的社会主义建设，为争取和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗不懈。
