The Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government of Xikang Province was established in November 1950. In the past few years, thanks to the correct implementation of ethnic policies, great achievements have been made in political, economic, and cultural construction. Based on the spirit of unity, equality, mutual assistance, and mutual concession, the Autonomous Region People's Government, with reference to historical customs and through consultation, mediated more than 3,000 disputes of various sizes, enabling most of the feuds within the Tibetan community to be reconciled. It actively supported and assisted the People's Liberation Army in successively suppressing the Kuomintang reactionary bandits and secret agents, stabilizing social order. It vigorously cultivated ethnic minority cadres in various work and training classes, and now has more than 2,600 ethnic minority cadres. It actively carried out production and economic work related to production, established trade organizations, and carried out cultural, educational, and health work. Through these efforts, the unity between and within ethnic groups has been enhanced, the people's patriotic awareness and enthusiasm for production have been raised, and the people's lives have been initially improved. A thriving new atmosphere of unprecedented ethnic unity has emerged throughout the region.

However, in the early days of the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government, it encountered many difficulties and problems that needed to be solved. First of all, due to the deep-rooted ethnic divisions left over from history, coupled with the open and covert instigation, rumor-mongering, and other sabotage activities of the Kuomintang reactionary remnants of bandits and secret agents, although most ethnic leaders held positions in the government, they did not understand the Party's policies, had great doubts and concerns, and did not dare to take bold responsibility in their work. Some were even unwilling to come to the Autonomous Region People's Government. On the other hand, although most Han cadres sincerely served the ethnic minorities, they did not understand the local situation and did not fully understand the ethnic policies. In their work, they used the experience they were accustomed to and familiar with in the Han areas, and some even violated the local ethnic groups' religious beliefs and customs, especially their understanding of the ideological concerns of the ethnic leaders was insufficient. They mistakenly believed that they would not be able to do their work, and therefore took over and replaced them in their work. Therefore, although ethnic leaders held leadership positions in some departments of the Autonomous Region People's Government, they generally felt that they had the title but no power. At that time, the Autonomous Region People's Government was not yet able to exercise its power in Tibetan, but used Chinese. Tibetan cadres could not understand various documents and instructions, so they had to pile the documents in their drawers. For a time, the organization of the Autonomous Region People's Government was virtually an empty shell. The political power below the Autonomous Region was also not established, and all resolutions and work arrangements could not be implemented.

In 1952, under the direct leadership of the CPC Kangding Prefectural Committee, the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province combined the study of ethnic policies with a review of the implementation of ethnic policies. Han cadres seriously criticized Han chauvinism, and leading comrades made public self-criticisms of the shortcomings and errors in their work at the meeting. This also greatly educated the minority cadres, and they were deeply moved, believing that: "Han cadres have left their hometowns to come here to suffer and work for us, and they still have to examine their mistakes. We should also examine our own work." Therefore, they also automatically examined local nationalism, and thus realized the true meaning of being the masters of their own affairs. For example, Awang Jiacuo, Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, said: "If we handle the matters ourselves, we have to learn policies and learn how to handle affairs. Although there are difficulties today, we will always learn slowly. We hope that Han cadres will give more help."

Through this review of ethnic policies, both ethnic and Han cadres improved their policy understanding. Han cadres further established the view of serving ethnic minorities for a long time; ethnic minority cadres also began to establish the idea of being the masters of their own affairs. The unity among cadres of all ethnic groups was strengthened, and thus great gains were made in realizing the nationalization of autonomous organs. First of all, collective office work was implemented in the Autonomous Region People's Government, and a system of government committee meetings and a system of requesting instructions and reporting were established. A series of effective measures such as explaining policies and studying work were used to actively help and cultivate Tibetan cadres, giving play to the enthusiasm of Tibetan leaders and ethnic cadres, and basically correcting the phenomenon of some Han cadres not respecting the powers of ethnic cadres in the past. All official documents and announcements are adopted in both Tibetan and Chinese languages, and Tibetan has become the main tool for exercising political power. In addition, work, study, and living systems were formulated according to Tibetan customs, and office, dormitory, and catering habits were arranged according to Tibetan customs. Tibetan cadres felt very comfortable and happy, and the people felt more cordial to the government. Han cadres also actively learned the Tibetan language, and general county and district-level Han cadres were able to use Tibetan to study work together with Tibetan cadres, which was more conducive to helping and cultivating Tibetan cadres to improve their work ability. Many Tibetan cadres also automatically learned Chinese. The mutual communication of languages between Han and Tibetan cadres increased mutual understanding, and the feelings became closer, the enthusiasm for work was higher, and they could actively put forward suggestions for improving the work. Some Tibetan county heads and government members automatically went to the countryside to promote policies and mediate feuds. Through these practical work, ethnic minority cadres were trained and improved their work ability. The Autonomous Region People's Government boldly promoted ethnic cadres at all levels. Among the sixteen department-level cadres of the Autonomous Region People's Government alone, fourteen were ethnic minority cadres. Due to the development of various tasks and the growth of ethnic cadres, lower-level political power was gradually established. Now all twenty counties in the entire autonomous region have established political power. Except for Luding County, where the Han people live, the county heads are all ethnic minority cadres. District-level political power has also been basically established, and production and public security committees have been established in some areas. Therefore, all instructions and decisions of the higher-level government have lower-level agencies to implement, and the lower-level government promptly reports the situation to the higher-level government, which improves communication and work efficiency. The Autonomous Region People's Government has also realized the first-level financial authority, which can more actively and systematically study and carry out the construction work of the entire autonomous region, and truly realize the right to be the masters of their own affairs in internal affairs of their own ethnic group.

    西康藏族人民真正当家作主了
    西康省藏族自治区人民政府主席  桑吉悦希（藏族）
    西康省藏族自治区人民政府成立于一九五○年十一月，几年来由于正确地执行了民族政策，在政治、经济、文化各方面的建设事业都获得了很大成绩。自治区人民政府本着团结、平等、互助互让的精神，参照历史习惯，用协商的方法，调解了大小纠纷三千多件，使藏族内部的冤家纠纷大多得到和解；积极支援和协助人民解放军先后剿灭了国民党反动派的土匪特务，安定了社会秩序；在各种工作中和训练班大力培养了民族干部，现已有民族干部两千六百多人；积极进行生产及与生产有联系的经济工作，设立了贸易机构，进行了文教、卫生工作。通过这些工作，增进了民族间和民族内部的团结，提高了人民爱国主义觉悟和生产积极性，初步改善了人民的生活，全区出现了空前的民族团结的兴旺的新气象。
    但是，在自治区人民政府成立初期，曾遇到不少困难和需要解决的问题。首先是由于历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂很深，加上国民党反动派残余土匪特务公开和隐蔽地进行挑拨造谣和其他破坏活动，大部民族领袖人物虽然在政府中担任了职务，但还不了解党的政策，怀疑和顾虑很大，在工作中不敢大胆负责，有的甚至不愿到自治区人民政府中来。另一方面，汉族干部虽然大部分是诚恳地为少数民族服务，但对当地情况不了解，对民族政策体会不够，在工作中搬用在汉族地区所习惯和熟悉的经验，甚至有的还违反了当地民族的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，特别是对民族领袖人物的思想顾虑不够了解，误以为他们不会干工作，于是在工作中包办代替。因此民族领袖人物虽然在自治区人民政府中担任某些部门的领导工作，但普遍感到有职无权。当时自治区人民政府还没有条件采用藏文行使政权，而是用汉文，藏族干部看不懂各种文件指示，只好把文件堆在抽屉里。自治区人民政府的机构曾有一个时期实际上是一个空架子。自治区下面的政权也没有建立，一切决议和工作布置无法贯彻下去。
    一九五二年，西康省藏族自治区在中共康定地委的直接领导下，结合民族政策的学习检查了民族政策执行情况。汉族干部严肃地批判了大汉族主义思想，领导同志对工作中的缺点和错误在大会上作了公开检讨。这样使少数民族干部也受到很大教育，并深受感动，认为：“汉族干部离开自己的家乡，来这里受苦受寒为我们工作，还要检查错误，我们也应该检查自己的工作才对。”于是也自动地检查了地方民族主义思想，从而认识了当家作主的真实意义。如自治区人民政府副主席阿旺嘉错说：“事情由我们来办，我们自己就不得不学习政策，学习办事，今天虽有困难，慢慢总会学会，希望汉族干部多多帮助。”
    通过这次民族政策的检查，民族干部与汉族干部在政策水平上都有了提高。汉族干部进一步树立了长期为少数民族服务的观点；少数民族干部也开始树立了主人翁的思想，各民族干部间更加团结了，因而在实现自治机关民族化方面有了很大收获。首先在自治区人民政府中实行集体办公，建立了政府委员会议制度、请示报告制度，用交代政策、研究工作等一系列的有效办法，积极帮助和培养藏族干部，发挥了藏族领袖人物及民族干部的积极性，基本上纠正了过去某些汉族干部不尊重民族干部职权的现象。一切公文、布告都采用藏、汉两种文字，藏文成为行使政权的主要工具。另外按藏族的风俗习惯制订了工作、学习和生活制度，办公室、宿舍以及伙食等生活习惯都按藏族风俗安排，藏族干部感到非常舒服和愉快，人民群众对政府也感到更加亲切。汉族干部又积极学习藏族语文，一般的县区级汉族干部都已能用藏语和藏族干部在一起研究工作，这就更有利于帮助和培养藏族干部提高工作能力。也有不少的藏族干部自动学习汉语汉文。汉藏干部之间语言互通了，就更增加了相互的了解，感情也就更为密切，工作热情也更高了，并能积极地对工作提出改进意见。有的藏族县长、政府委员自动下乡宣传政策，调解冤家。通过这些实际工作，少数民族干部受到锻炼，提高了工作能力。自治区人民政府并大胆提拔了各级民族干部，仅自治区人民政府十六个处长级干部中就有十四名是少数民族干部。由于各种工作的开展和民族干部的成长，逐步建立了下级政权，现在全自治区二十个县已全部建立政权，除汉族聚居的泸定县外，县长都是少数民族干部，区级政权也基本建立，部分地区已建立了乡和村的生产治安委员会。因此，上级政府的一切指示和决定有下级机构去执行，下级政府及时向上级反映情况，使上下通了气，提高了工作效率。自治区人民政府并已实现了一级财政权限，这就更能主动地、有计划地研究和开展全自治区的建设工作，真正实现了在本民族内部事务上当家作主的权利。
