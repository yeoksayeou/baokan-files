    Sailing down the Yangtze River from Wuhan for about 140 kilometers, you reach the emerging industrial city of Huangshi in the middle reaches of the Yangtze. This beautiful city, nestled at the foot of verdant and graceful mountains, looks as normal as ever: the tall chimneys standing at the eastern and central ends of the city are still majestically spewing thick black, yellow, or milky white smoke. The cable car buckets on the Huaxin Cement Plant's elevated cableway are still running in the air as usual.
    As our ship approached the shore, we saw countless flood control personnel busily reinforcing the dikes along the riverbanks, stretching for dozens of miles. Since late June, the people of Huangshi have been fighting tenaciously against the flood. Now, five fierce flood peaks have passed. This young industrial city, known for its production of steel, cement, and power resources, still stands firmly before the high water level of the Yangtze River. A heroic flood control army, mainly composed of workers and soldiers, is guarding the dikes along the river in Huangshi day and night.
    On the night of July 11th, at about 9 p.m., a section of the dike in Huangshi City breached under the impact of the rapidly rising floodwaters. The river water poured through the breach, about ten meters wide, like a waterfall into the interior of the dike. At this time, the people guarding the dike immediately rushed to the dangerous section from all directions. They began to throw grass bags, sacks, and wooden boards into the breach, trying to block the pouring floodwaters. But the things thrown in were immediately swept away by the flood. Seeing the water becoming more and more turbulent, the situation was extremely critical. At this moment, some people bravely jumped into the water, holding hands to block the flood with their bodies; others intensified their efforts to transport flood control materials and repair the breach. Construction workers Wang Shaocheng, He Guangming, and Zheng Fang'an, who came from the expansion site of the Daye Steel Plant, were knocked down by the flood; but they got up and rushed forward against the torrent, fighting stubbornly against the flood. Worker Liu Xijun was knocked down by a fierce wave while carrying a sack full of mud to repair the breach, but he got up and carried the sack straight to the breach. In this way, people blocked the flood, connecting the broken dike line. Then, the People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed here excellently completed the reinforcement and repair project with two consecutive days and nights of non-stop fighting.
    Four days later, one afternoon, on a section of the dike near the First Power Plant of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau, Wang Qizhou, a line worker and member of the Communist Youth League, suddenly discovered that a place on the half-waist of the dike was protruding, which was a sign of a leak. Once discovered, he bravely rushed forward and used his body to press down on the protruding soil, while shouting loudly. At the foot of the dike, another leak appeared, and muddy water was penetrating the dike. At this time, the people who were guarding the nearby dikes all gathered around. Some of them followed Wang Qizhou's example and rushed forward, pressing one after another, layer upon layer, on the raised soil. Some immediately jumped into the water to find and block the leak below. Hua Dakui, Deputy Secretary of the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Song Zhongzhou, Acting Mayor of Huangshi City, also arrived here to participate in the rescue. The families of the workers living nearby offered their cotton wadding and cotton-padded clothes to block the leaks. More than four hours later, the leak was blocked, and Wang Qizhou was also exhausted and fainted. In an instant, when he was slightly awake, he got up and jumped into the water, cutting off the wires that were hindering the construction.
    On the morning of July 29th, a section of the dike body, thirty meters long, at the Laohutou construction site on the western end of the dry dike was sinking, and very serious cracking occurred on the dike surface and waist. Here, it had been breached by the flood in 1931. The breach was not rescued that time, causing serious damage to the dike foundation. After liberation, although it had been repaired, it eventually became the main cause of this accident. On this day, when the dangerous situation was discovered, the heroic flood control army of Huangshi City immediately put forward the battle cry of "If the dike sinks an inch, we will resolutely fill it with an inch." The people carrying soil quickly formed a transport line like an endless "transmission belt," carrying thousands of loads of new soil to fill the sinking dike surface. Then, four pile-driving teams composed of excellent pile drivers participating in the Daye Steel Plant expansion project arrived, and the assault team of the rescue team also arrived. ... After five days and nights of intense fighting, they finally saved the dike body sinking and cracking phenomenon with unparalleled perseverance, making the dike stand firmly in front of the flood.
    The people of Huangshi City have been bravely fighting against the unprecedented fierce Yangtze River flood for fifty-five days by August 18th. Among them, the days exceeding the highest water level in previous years (24.78 meters in 1931) have lasted for forty-six days. On the 18th, the Yangtze River water level in Huangshi City rose to 26.36 meters, exceeding the historical record by 1.58 meters. For more than fifty days, this industrial city standing in front of the flood, under the protection of the long dike, the employees of steel factories, cement factories, power plants, and coal mines have been working selflessly on the production and construction front day and night. In July, when floods and rainstorms violently attacked, the employees of the Daye Steel Plant completed the state plan for five major products, including high-quality steel and ordinary steel, with a surplus of 22.67% to 0.45%. Cheng Xiangquan, a coal mining worker at the Yuanhua Coal Mine, and the earth-digging workers of the key project of the open-hearth furnace expansion of the Daye Steel Plant, respectively created new records for hard coal seam mining and foundation excavation in mid-July. The First Power Plant of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau, known as the industrial "heart" of Huangshi City, under the slogan of "Ensuring safety and supporting the construction and flood control struggle of Wuhan and Huangshi," has not had any power outages or major personal accidents since July. In order to better complete the tasks of industrial production and construction, the broad masses of employees have continued to promote the technical innovation movement with their own wisdom. The electrical workers here, led by Communist Party members Niu Zishan and Liu Muqing, once used collective wisdom in July to continuously create mechanized and automated loading and unloading equipment such as "turbine silencers," "automatic reclosing," and "motorized dust collectors." Coal mine workers and technicians cooperated to successfully trial-produce a mechanized device for underground transportation -
  "endless rope" on July 5th, which not only greatly reduced labor intensity, but also increased coal transportation efficiency by more than doubled. The line workers active in the Huangshi urban area and on the Wu (Han) Da (Ye) line, in order to send electricity to factories and mines and send light to the people of Wuhan and Huangshi - especially the people who are working hard on the flood control front, have been maintaining the circuits that are as important as arteries on the human body in these days, braving wind and rain, day and night. On July 29th, it was a day of strong winds and rainstorms. In order to universally raise and reinforce the high-voltage power poles on the Wuda line, the line workers started working at high altitude on the lake surface with a water depth of 3 meters to 8 meters at dawn. The task assigned to them by the superiors on this day was to complete the entire project at 5 pm, but they completed the task one hour to four hours ahead of schedule, ensuring safe power transmission.

    屹立在洪水前的黄石市
    新华社记者　方堤　夏牧原
    从武汉乘船顺江东下，大约有一百四十多公里的路程，便到达长江中游新兴的工业城市——黄石市。这座排在一带青葱秀丽的山下的美丽的城市，有如平时一样：那些矗立在市区东端和中部的高大的烟囱，照常气势雄壮地吐着浓黑的、黄色的或乳白的烟雾。华新水泥厂的高架缆道上的挂斗，照常在空中运行着。
    我们的船将泊岸时，看到长达几十里的沿江干堤上，数不清的防汛人员正在紧张地修筑着堤防。从六月下旬起，黄石市人民一直顽强地和洪水搏斗着。到现在五次凶猛的洪峰已经过去了。这座以出产钢铁、水泥，并有着动力资源的年轻的工业城市仍安然屹立在长江高水位面前。一支以工人和部队为主力的英雄防汛大军，日日夜夜坚守在黄石市的沿江堤防上。
    七月十一日晚上九点多钟，黄石市有一段堤防在猛速上涨的洪水冲击下溃口了。江水穿过约十公尺宽的溃口，像瀑布一样向堤内倾泻。这时守堤的人们，立即从四面八方奔向出险的地段。他们开始用草包、麻袋、木板向溃口投去，想堵住倾泻的洪水。但所投下去的东西，立即被洪水卷走。眼看着水势愈来愈猛，情况万分危急。就在这个时候，有一些人便奋不顾身地跳下水去，手挽手地用身体挡住洪水；另外一些人加紧搬运防汛器材，抢修溃口。从大冶钢厂扩建工地上来的建筑工人王绍成、何广明、郑方安等，被洪水冲倒了；但是他们爬起来迎着激流又冲上去，倔强地和洪水搏斗。工人刘熙君扛着满装泥土的麻袋去抢修溃口时，被凶猛的浪头打倒了，爬起来又扛起麻袋直送到溃口上。就是这样，人们堵住了洪水；使被洪水冲断了的堤线又连接起来了。接着，驻防在这里的人民解放军战士，又以连续两昼夜不停息的战斗，出色地完成了加固补漏工程。　　四天以后的一个下午，在武汉冶电业局第一发电厂附近的一段堤线上，线路工人、青年团员王启洲忽然发现堤的半腰有个地方凸出来了，这就是要出漏洞的征兆。一经发现他就勇猛地扑上前去，用自己的身体压住凸出来的泥土，同时大声呼唤着。这时在堤脚下面，另一个漏洞又出现了，一股浑水正穿堤而入。这时坚守在附近堤防上的人们都集拢来了。他们中间有的学着王启洲的榜样扑上前去，一个挨着一个、一层压着一层地压在凸起的土面上。有的立即跳下水去，寻找和堵塞下面的那个漏洞。中共黄石市委副书记华大魁和黄石市人民政府代理市长宋中洲也赶到了这里，参加抢救。住在附近的工人家属纷纷献出了自己的棉絮、棉袄来堵塞漏洞。四个多钟头后，漏洞堵住了，王启洲也疲劳得昏沉了。一转瞬间，当他稍清醒些时，爬起来又跳到水里，把妨碍着施工的电线剪断。
    七月二十九日清晨，干堤西端的老虎头工地有
  一段长三十公尺的堤身在下沉，堤面和堤腰也发生了十分严重的崩裂现象。就在这里，一九三一年曾被洪水突破过。那次溃口没有抢救住，使堤基遭到了严重的破坏。解放后，虽然进行过培修，终究成为这次出险的主要原因。这一天，当险情发现后，黄石市英雄的防汛大军立即提出了“堤防下沉一寸，我们坚决填上一寸”的战斗口号。挑土的人们迅速地组成了一条如像永不停息的“传动皮带”似的运输线，把成千上万挑新土填在正在下沉的堤面上。接着由参加大冶钢厂扩建工程的优秀打桩手们组成的四个打桩队来到了，抢险大队的突击队员们也来到了，……经过五昼夜的紧张的战斗后，他们终于以无比的毅力挽救了堤身下沉和崩裂现象，使堤防稳固地屹立在洪水面前。
    黄石市人民英勇地和空前凶猛的长江洪水搏斗，到八月十八日止已经五十五天了。其中，超过历年最高水位（一九三一年的二四点七八公尺）的日子已经持续了四十六天。十八日，黄石市长江水位涨到了二六点三六公尺，已超过历史最高纪录达一点五八公尺。五十多天来，这座屹立在洪水面前的工业城市，在漫长的堤防的捍卫下，钢铁工厂、水泥工厂、发电厂和煤矿等企业部门的职工，日日夜夜地在生产、建设战线上进行着忘我的劳动。在洪水和暴雨猛烈袭击的七月里，大冶钢厂的职工们，以超额百分之二二点六七到百分之零点四五的成绩，完成了优质钢材和普通钢材等五种主要产品的国家计划。源华煤矿采煤工人程香泉和大冶钢厂扩建的平炉重点工程的挖土工人们，七月中旬曾分别创造了硬煤层采煤和基础掘土的新纪录。被称为黄石市工业“心脏”的武汉冶电业局第一发电厂，在“保证安全，支援武汉、黄石两市的建设和防汛斗争”的口号下，七月以来一直没有发生过任何停电事故和重大人身事故。广大职工为了更好地完成工业生产和建设任务，还用自己的智慧把技术革新运动继续推向前进。这里的电气工人，在共产党员牛自善、刘木卿的带动下，七月曾经运用集体智慧连续创造了“透平消音器”、“自动合闸”和“机动洗尘器”等机械化、自动化装运。煤矿工人和技术人员合作，在七月五日试制井下运输的机械化装置——
  “无极绳”成功，结果不仅大大减轻了劳动强度，并且使运煤效率提高了一倍以上。活跃在黄石市区和武（汉）大（冶）线上的线路工人们，为了把电力送往厂矿，把光明送给武汉、黄石两座城市的人民——特别是辛勤战斗在防汛战线上的人们，这些日子曾冒着暴风雨，不分白天黑夜地维护着如像人体上的动脉管一样重要的电路。七月二十九日，正是一个狂风挟着暴雨的日子，线路工人们为了把武大线上的高压电线杆普遍加高加固，天刚破晓，就在水深三公尺到八公尺的湖面上进行高空作业。这天上级交给他们的任务是要在下午五时完成全部工程，他们却提前一小时到四小时把任务完成，保证了安全送电。
