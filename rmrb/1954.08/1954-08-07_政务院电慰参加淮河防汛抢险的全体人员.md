    【新华社蚌埠六日电】中央人民政府政务院八月一日致电慰问参加淮河防汛抢险的工人、农民、部队、学生、机关工作人员和全体工作同志。电文如下：
    今年因为暴雨集中，淮河流域发生了超过一九三一与一九五零年的特大洪水。由于你们在各级党委与人民政府的领导下，不畏艰险，不辞劳苦，夜以继日地防守和抢护，在超过历年最高水位的情况下，保卫了沿淮重要城市、工矿、交通和广大地区人民生命财产与农业生产的安全。你们这种英勇的斗争，对于我国增加农业生产、保证社会主义建设的顺利进行，起着重要的作用。这是一个光荣而艰巨的任务，应该受到全国人民的感激和尊敬。
    现在淮河防汛已经进入最紧张的阶段，同时也是接近最后胜利的阶段，特向你们致深切的慰问。并盼严密注意，坚决防守，克服一切困难，再接再厉，为争取最后战胜洪水而奋斗。
