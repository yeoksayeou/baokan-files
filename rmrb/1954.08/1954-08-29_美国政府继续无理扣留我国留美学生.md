Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: Since the Chinese and American delegations made contact at the Geneva Conference regarding the issue of students and overseas Chinese in both countries, the US government has not ceased its measures to detain Chinese students, and many Chinese students in the US are still unable to return to their homeland and reunite with their families.

After the Geneva Conference concluded, the Chinese and American delegations entrusted the issue of students and overseas Chinese from both countries to the Chinese Consulate General in Geneva and the US Consulate General in Geneva for continued contact. From June 5th to July 29th, Chinese and American representatives had a total of seven contacts in Geneva. The Chinese side demanded that the US immediately cease its forced detention of Chinese students, and that when students requested to leave the US and return to their homeland, the US government should not obstruct or detain them in any way.

As a result of these contacts, the US State Department has, to date, agreed to allow twenty-two Chinese students to leave the country. However, the US government has not ceased forcibly detaining Chinese students. The US side claims that since 1951, it has only refused exit permits to one hundred and twenty-four Chinese students; and that now, after "investigation," only half of these one hundred and twenty-four still want to return to China. This is clearly not in accordance with the facts. Because the US government has persecuted Chinese students who requested to return to their country, many Chinese students are afraid to apply for return visas. As long as the US government ceases persecuting and obstructing Chinese students who want to return to their country, surely more than just fifty or sixty of the approximately five thousand Chinese students studying in the US will want to return to their homeland.

A letter from Zhang Jiahua and twenty-five other Chinese students in the US to US President Eisenhower on August 5th exposed the lies of the US representatives regarding Chinese students not wanting to return to their country, and also exposed the truth about the US government forcibly detaining Chinese students. Disregarding the threats and intimidation from the US government, Zhang Jiahua and others wrote a joint letter to US President Eisenhower, demanding that the US government respect human rights, rescind the original ban, and allow Chinese students to leave the US at any time. The letter stated: "Some of us, after completing certain stages of specialized studies, have applied for departure permits,...but these applications have been rejected without exception, and immigration authorities have also told us that none of the thousands of Chinese students studying engineering will be allowed to leave." The US government's actions of forcibly detaining Chinese students, causing them to live away from their homes and wander in foreign lands, are completely contrary to morality and human feelings, and completely unreasonable.

The US government's unreasonable behavior has not only aroused indignation among the Chinese people and Chinese students in the US, but even American public opinion has expressed disapproval. The American bourgeois newspaper, the "New York World-Telegram and the Sun," criticized the US policy of unreasonably detaining Chinese students in an editorial on May 29th of this year. On June 14th, six Americans wrote to the "New York Times," arguing that the US government's detention of Chinese students who had not committed any crimes "is incompatible with American judicial principles."

The Chinese people are paying attention to how the US government handles the just demand of the twenty-six Chinese students to return to their country. The right to return to their homeland of these twenty-six and the five thousand Chinese students in the US in similar situations has been rudely deprived by the US government for several years, and now it is time for the US government to restore their right to return.

### 美国政府继续无理扣留我国留美学生

    美国政府继续无理扣留我国留美学生
    【新华社二十八日讯】自从日内瓦会议期间中国代表团和美国代表团在关于中美两国留学生和侨民问题上进行接触之后，美国政府还没有停止扣留中国留学生的措施，许多中国留美学生还是不能返回祖国，和他们的家人团聚。
    在日内瓦会议结束以后，中美两国代表团将两国留学生和侨民问题交由中国驻日内瓦总领事馆和美国驻日内瓦总领事馆继续进行接触。从六月五日到七月二十九日，中美双方代表在日内瓦一共有过七次接触。中国方面要求美方立即停止强制扣留中国留学生，当留学生要求离开美国返回祖国的时候，美国政府不得以任何方式加以阻难或扣留。
    经过这些接触，美国国务院到今天为止，已经答应让二十二名中国留学生出境。但是，美国政府还没有停止强迫扣留中国留学生。美国方面说什么从一九五一年以来，只拒绝发给一百二十四名中国留学生出境证；而且说现在经过“调查”，这一百二十四名中只有半数仍然想回中国。这显然不符事实。由于美国政府对要求返国的中国留学生横加迫害，使许多中国留学生不敢请求回国签证。只要美国政府停止对要求回国的中国留学生加以迫害和阻难，那么五千名左右的中国留美学生要返回祖国的
  一定不只五六十人。
    中国留美学生张家骅等二十六人八月五日给美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封信，揭穿了美国代表关于中国留学生不愿回国的谎话，也揭穿了美国政府强迫扣留中国留学生的事实真相。张家骅等人不顾美国政府的威胁和恫吓，向美国总统艾森豪威尔写了一封联名信，要求美国政府尊重人权，取消原有禁令，允许中国留学生可以随时离开美国。这封信写着：“我们有些人在完成了某些阶段的专科学习后，曾经申请过离境许可证，……但是这些申请都毫无例外地被拒绝了，同时移民当局还对我们说，数千名学习工科的中国学生没有一个人会获准离境。其余的人感到申请没有用，因此没有提出。”美国政府这种强迫扣留中国留学生，使他们离乡背井，流落异国的行动，是完全违反天理人情，完全没有道理的。
    美国政府的无理行为，不但在中国人民和中国留美学生中引起了义愤，就连美国的舆论也有表示不赞同的。美国资产阶级报纸“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”今年五月二十九日的社评就批评过美国无理扣留中国留学生的政策。六月十四日又有六名美国人致函“纽约时报”，认为美国政府扣留并未犯法的中国留学生“是和美国司法原则不相容的”。
    中国人民正注意着美国政府如何处理二十六名中国留学生的正义的回国要求。这二十六人和处于类似境地的五千名中国留美学生的返回祖国的权利被美国政府蛮横地剥夺了好几年，现在该是美国政府恢复他们的返国权利的时候了。
