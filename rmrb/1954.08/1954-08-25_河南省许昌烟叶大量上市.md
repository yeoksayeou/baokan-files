    Henan Province's Xuchang Tobacco Leaves Enter Market in Large Quantities
    The famous Xuchang tobacco leaves in our country have entered the market in large quantities. This year, tobacco farmers have improved their tobacco planting techniques and overcome the fairly serious tobacco leaf pests and diseases, so that more than 1.1 million mu of tobacco can maintain last year's total output. When the new tobacco was put on the market, the local economic departments had already prepared the means of production and livelihood needed by the tobacco farmers. At present, the exchange of materials in the Xuchang market has become more active.

    河南省许昌烟叶大量上市
    我国著名的许昌烟叶已经大量上市。烟农们今年改进了种烟技术，战胜了相当严重的烟叶病虫害，使一百一十多万亩烟可以保持去年的总产量。当地经济部门在新烟上市的时候，已经把烟农们需要的生产资料和生活资料准备妥当。目前，许昌市场上的物资交流已更加活跃。
