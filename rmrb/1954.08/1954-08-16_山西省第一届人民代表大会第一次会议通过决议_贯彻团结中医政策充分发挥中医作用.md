    The First Session of the First People's Congress of Shanxi Province passed a resolution on implementing the policy of uniting traditional Chinese medicine and giving greater play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine. The resolution first pointed out that Chinese medicine is an important part of our nation's precious cultural heritage. It has made inestimable contributions to the Chinese nation's struggle against disease, survival, and reproduction for thousands of years. Medical and preventive work in the vast rural areas basically relies on traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome shortcomings in uniting traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, comprehensively implement the policy of uniting traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and give full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine in health care work. The resolution calls on traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine to continue to organize joint clinics of traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and to encourage the establishment of pharmacies selling Chinese medicine. Reasonable regulations should be made for the fees of traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment. When traditional Chinese medicine practitioners leave production to engage in medical and preventive work, they must be given reasonable living expenses. The tax revenue of Chinese medicine shops should also be realistically and reasonably levied, correcting the bias of excessive or insufficient taxation, and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should continue to be absorbed into the leadership of health administrative departments and medical and preventive institutions at all levels, as well as into medical work. The Provincial Health Department and the Municipal Health Bureaus should establish Traditional Chinese Medicine Departments, and each special commissioner's office and county health section should also set up full-time cadres or designate special personnel to manage the work of traditional Chinese medicine. Comprehensive hospitals in provinces, special districts, and cities should gradually establish Traditional Chinese Medicine Departments. Research work on Chinese medicine should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. The Shanxi Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Advanced Studies School should be affiliated with a Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute to serve as the core for the province's research on traditional Chinese medicine. Currently, the focus should be on collecting, researching, and promoting the effective clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine. The Shanxi Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Advanced Studies School and the Traditional Chinese Medicine Advanced Studies Classes in various places should focus on studying Chinese medicine as the main course, supplemented by basic knowledge courses of modern medicine, to overcome the bias of "Westernizing traditional Chinese medicine." All secondary health technical schools in the province should gradually add courses in traditional Chinese medicine. If the conditions are insufficient, courses in acupuncture therapy can be taught first. The cause of traditional Chinese medicine should be developed accordingly. The Provincial People's Government should instruct the state trade departments and cooperative systems to strengthen the operation of traditional Chinese medicine, and should instruct the agricultural departments to strengthen the cultivation of traditional Chinese medicine to expand the source of medicine.
    Over the past five years, more than 2,000 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Shanxi Province have been successively absorbed into county and district medical institutions, accounting for 47 percent of the total number of medical personnel in county and district medical institutions. Health workers' associations have been generally established throughout the province, and a Traditional Chinese Medicine Medical Association has also been established in Taiyuan City. About 3,800 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners throughout the province have organized 597 joint clinics. Thirty percent of the total number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in the province have undergone advanced studies.
    When discussing and passing this resolution, the representatives unanimously expressed their support, criticized the shortcomings in uniting traditional Chinese medicine, and put forward many valuable opinions. An Bolin, president of the Provincial Changzhi Hospital, Qin Guodong, president of the Taiyuan Private First Joint Hospital, and Li Zhenru, director of the Qixian Health Society and a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, all expressed that they would take the lead in resolutely implementing the resolution. Li Zhenru also expressed that he would use the method of taking apprentices to widely disseminate clinical experience, effective prescriptions, and the secrets of acupuncture.

    山西省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议通过决议
    贯彻团结中医政策充分发挥中医作用
    山西省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议通过了一项关于贯彻团结中医政策，更大地发挥中医作用的决议。决议首先指出，中国医药学术是我国民族宝贵文化遗产的重要部分，它对中国民族几千年来战胜疾病、生存繁殖有不可估量的贡献，广大农村的医疗预防工作基本上要靠中医来担任，因此必须克服在团结中医和西医工作上的缺点，全面地贯彻团结中医和西医的政策，充分发挥中医在卫生保健工作中的作用。决议号召中医和西医继续组织中医与中医、中医与西医的联合诊所，提倡附设中药铺。对中医诊疗费要做出合理的规定。中医脱离生产担任医疗预防工作时，必须给予合理的生活费用。对中药铺的税收，也应实事求是地合理征收，纠正畸轻畸重的偏向，并应继续吸收中医参加卫生行政部门和各级医疗预防机构的领导工作和医疗工作。省卫生厅和市卫生局，都应建立中医科，各专署、县卫生科亦应设专职干部或指定专人管理中医工作。省、专署、市的综合医院，应逐步建立中医部。对我国医药学术的研究工作要有计划有步骤地去进行。山西省中医进修学校应附设中医研究所，做为全省研究中医学术的核心。目前应着重汇集、研究和推广中医有效的临床经验。省中医进修学校和各地中医进修班，今后应以学习中国医药学术为主要课程，辅之以现代医学基础知识课程，克服“中医西医化”的偏向。全省各中级卫生技术学校应逐步增添中医课程，条件不足的，可先讲授针灸疗法课程。要相应地发展中药事业，省人民政府应责成国家贸易部门和合作社系统加强经营中药业务，并应责成农业部门加强中药培植工作，以扩大药源。
    五年来，山西省各地陆续吸收两千多名中医参加了县、区医疗机构，占县、区医疗机构医务人员总数的百分之四十七，全省各地普遍建立了卫生工作者协会，太原市还建立了中医医学会，全省约有三千八百多名中医组织了五百九十七个联合诊所。全省占中医总数百分之三十的中医经过进修。
    代表们在讨论、通过这一决议时一致表示拥护，并批评了在团结中医方面存在的缺点，提出了许多宝贵意见。省立长治医院院长安伯林，太原私营第一联合医院院长秦国栋和祁县卫生学会主任、中医李珍如等都表示要带头坚决执行决议。李珍如并表示要用带徒弟的办法，将临床经验、有效良方和针灸妙诀等广为传播。　　　（新华社）
