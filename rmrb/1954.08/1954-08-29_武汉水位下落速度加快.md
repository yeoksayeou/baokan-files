Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 28th: The rate at which the Yangtze River water level at Wuhan Port is dropping has accelerated slightly today. At 5:00 PM, the water level was 29.36 meters, a decrease of 9 centimeters compared to the same time on August 27th. This is the largest single-day drop in the ten days since the Wuhan Port water level began to recede. Compared to the highest water level in previous years, it is currently still 1.08 meters above.

From 12:00 AM to 5:00 AM on the 28th, Wuhan experienced a level four northerly wind. In the latter half of the night, the waves battered the dikes, which had already been submerged under high water levels for a month and a half, posing a significant threat. Thanks to the strengthened defenses of the flood control personnel, no major incidents occurred.

On the 28th, another flood peak from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River reached the Three Gorges. The water level at the Three Gorges has risen by 12 meters in the past three days. Above Jianli in the middle reaches, the water level is also rising. After this water reaches the middle reaches, the rising trend will gradually weaken due to the wide river surface and the ability of many lakes to regulate water volume.

The fifth phase of dike reinforcement in Wuhan is proceeding intensely. The dike reinforcement project from above Hankou Wuhan Port to the Han River Railway Bridge construction site has been basically completed. A long sub-dike has been newly built within the riverside flood wall from below Wuchang Wutai Lock to the vicinity of the First Cotton Mill.

On the 27th, the Beijing Opera Troupe of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government arrived in Wuhan. They performed programs that evening to慰问 (offer comfort to) the Wuhan flood control personnel. They will continue to perform for 慰问 (comfort) on the evening of the 28th.

    武汉水位下落速度加快
    【新华社武汉二十八日电】二十八日，武汉关长江水位下落的速度又加快了一点。在下午五时，水位为二九点三六公尺，比二十七日同一时间下落了九公分。这是武汉关水位开始回落以后十天来下落最多的一天。和历年最高水位比较，目前还超过一点零八公尺。
    二十七日晚十二时到二十八日早晨五时，武汉又起了四级的北风，在下半夜，风浪打在堤上，这些堤在高水位下已经浸泡一个半月了，受到的威胁很大。由于防汛人员加强防守，没有发生重大险情。
    二十八日，长江上游来的又一次洪峰已到三峡，近三天来三峡水位上涨十二公尺。中游监利以上，水位也都在上涨。这股水到达中游后，由于中游江面宽阔和许多湖泊调节水量，涨势逐渐减弱。
    武汉市第五期加固堤防的工程正紧张进行，在汉口武汉关以上一直到汉水铁桥工地的堤防加固工程已基本完工，武昌武泰闸以下到第一纱厂附近的沿江防水墙内，已新修起一道很长的子堤。
    二十七日，中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部京剧团到达武汉，当晚即演出节目慰问武汉防汛人员。二十八日晚，将继续作慰问演出。
