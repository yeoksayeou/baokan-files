    尼赫鲁在印度国大党国会党团会议上说
    周总理访问印度使中印关系更加密切
    【新华社新德里二十四日电】印度总理尼赫鲁二十二日在印度国大党国会党团会议上所作的报告中指出，周恩来总理访问印度使中印关系更加密切了。尼赫鲁说，周恩来总理在德里会谈中表现了友好的和现实的态度。
    尼赫鲁在谈到他访问中国的问题时说，只有在他能成行时，他才会对他的访问问题作出决定。在谈到关于海南岛附近上空发生的英国飞机事件时，尼赫鲁认为：由于中国和英国的有益的态度，这次危机已经解决。
      尼赫鲁在演说中还谈到了印度对促成印度支那停战的作用和中立国遣返委员会在朝鲜停战中的作用等问题。
    谈到外国在印度的属地的问题时，尼赫鲁表示，他不久将要在国会就印境法国租界问题发表声明，随后再就葡萄牙属地问题发表声明。他说，他要向国大党议员们保证，印度的政策既不是软弱的，也不是游移不定的。
