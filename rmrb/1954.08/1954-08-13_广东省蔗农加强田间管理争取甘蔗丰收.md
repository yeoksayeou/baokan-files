Guangdong sugarcane farmers are strengthening field management to strive for a good sugarcane harvest.

    The more than one million mu of sugarcane planted in Guangdong Province this year are growing well, generally reaching over six feet in height. It is estimated that production will increase by an average of about 15 percent compared to last year. This year, Guangdong Province expanded its sugarcane planting area by more than 150,000 mu. To solve the production and livelihood difficulties of sugarcane farmers, relevant departments, in addition to sending cadres to assist in technical reforms, have also implemented sugarcane pre-purchase work in various sugarcane areas. As of early July, the province had issued over 44 billion yuan in pre-purchase deposits. The state-owned Shunde Sugar Factory also lent sugarcane farmers 15 jin of "666" insecticide powder and 200,000 yuan in fertilizer costs per mu of sugarcane land. This greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of sugarcane farmers, who actively processed and fertilized to increase yield per unit area. Sugarcane farmers in the Fourth District of Zhongshan County used all of their pre-purchase deposits to buy fertilizer. Sugarcane farmers in Xuwen, Haikang, and other counties, who had no fertilizing habits in the past, have also begun to apply topdressing this year. In Shunde County, 190,000 mu of sugarcane land has generally completed two rounds of inter-tillage and soil application work; to make up for the shortage of commercial fertilizers, soil application is generally half a month earlier than in the past.

    广东省蔗农加强田间管理争取甘蔗丰收
    广东省今年种植的一百多万亩甘蔗，生长良好，一般都已长到六尺多高，估计可比去年平均增产百分之十五左右。广东省今年甘蔗种植面积扩大了十五万多亩。为了解决蔗农生产生活上的困难，有关部门除派出干部协助进行技术改革外，并对各蔗区实行了甘蔗的预购工作，截至七月初旬，全省发放出的预购定金就达四百四十余亿元。国营顺德糖厂，还贷放给蔗农每亩蔗地十五斤“六六六”杀虫粉和二十万元肥料费。因之大大鼓舞了蔗农生产热情，积极加工加肥，争取提高单位面积产量。中山县第四区蔗农将全部预购定金购买了肥料。徐闻、海康等县蔗农过去从无施肥习惯，今年也开始施追肥。顺德县十九万亩蔗地已普遍完成了两次中耕上泥工作；为弥补商品肥料的不足，上泥一般都比过去提早半个月。　（吴尔祥）
