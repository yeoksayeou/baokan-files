    What is Principal in Life is Principal in Dramatic Creation
    Soviet Union　Kang· Simonov
    Editor's note: The Second All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers will be convened this year. During the current preparation period, Soviet newspapers and periodicals have successively published comments on several principled issues in literary creation and criticism. This article is one of them. Simonov here criticizes some writers' erroneous views on creating positive and negative characters, which violate the Party's principles of literature, namely: doubting the typicalization method in artistic creation, believing that writers should describe people "as they are," and believing that dividing characters into positive and negative would produce formalism. Similar confused ideas also occurred in Chinese literary circles during the debate on creating typical images of positive characters, with arguments such as that heroic figures cannot be found in life. This article can be used as a reference for Chinese literary workers.
    On the eve of the Second All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers, when silently reviewing our literary work and assessing the still unsatisfactory situation of our theatrical creation, it is natural to raise the question of what position the image of positive characters occupies in our drama.
    On the podiums of various literary discussions and conferences, especially at the plenary session of the 14th Council of the Soviet Writers Association and the discussion on "The Status of Positive Characters in Modern Drama," some people expressed doubts about the regularity of dividing characters into positive and negative. They said: This is a kind of formalism! You know, in life, we cannot divide people into positive and negative. We are surrounded by people with various personalities. Why turn vivid life into formulas? We should describe them as they are, so that truth will naturally be obtained.
    At first glance, these arguments sound appealing, but in essence, they are corrupt. These arguments are an attempt to revise the method of socialist realism, doubt the necessity of typicalization of life phenomena in art, and forget the Party's principle in literature.
    Of course, life is life, and living people are living people. But when evaluating the events of our lives, do we not point out that some phenomena are advanced and others are backward? Do we not evaluate some people's behavior as a good example, while others' behavior as bad? Furthermore, when talking about people who have both advantages and disadvantages, can we not say that some people are growing, improving, and overcoming their weaknesses? Can we not say that there are still some people who are getting worse, and even sometimes degenerating and losing the advantages they once had?
    At the same time, what interests us is not the abstract struggle between good and evil in a person; we value a person's activities that are conducive to the construction of communism, and at the same time, we condemn a person's behavior that subjectively or objectively harms our common cause. According to this criterion, we consciously and specially point out good examples in practical life, reveal bad examples, and take some as objects of emulation and others as objects of exposure. In this way, no one will accuse us of formalizing the phenomena of life and mechanically classifying life.
    However, when it comes to literature, especially theatrical creation, criticism begins to encourage objectivism, enumeration of phenomena, and the saying that: People are living people, and all people are like this on the one hand and like that on the other hand. In the final analysis, everyone is right! This objectivism is often stolen under the banner of striving for the truth of life. Many articles published in the "New World" magazine recently contain similar views disguised not very well.
    Naturally, the dispute is not about nouns. The attempt to eliminate the concept of positive characters in our literature is not a naive conclusion of exploring nouns. No, it is a stubborn unwillingness to admit this principle: the good part of our life that dominates and its embodiment—positive characters—is the core of our literature. This dominance of the good part is the new thing in our socialist literature. It is futile to talk about socialist realism without departing from this point.
    This is not to say that there were no images of positive characters in the great literary works of the past. However, the position occupied by positive characters in Soviet literature is a new position in terms of quality, and this position is related to the essence of our society.
    The Party criticizes the phenomenon of literary figures embellishing reality, and the Party calls on us to create satirical works, to expose bad people, and to expose everything decadent and outdated. However, have all literary figures, especially playwrights, drawn correct conclusions from this criticism?
    According to many scripts, it is clear that this is far from the case. Some playwrights have forgotten that the good side of our life and positive characters are the main objects of literary attention and love in any case, past and present. The noble image of heroic communist builders is the core of excellent Soviet literary works in the past and in the future, and the Party has repeatedly pointed this out to writers.
    On the one hand, the Party and the Party's newspapers criticize our literary figures for often deviating from the true depiction of life and avoiding the dark side of life. On the other hand, they point out a fruitful path for us. By moving forward along this path, we can most vividly express the complete face of the characters of our time and express them in their careers and in their constant struggle against everything that still hinders the construction of a communist society.
    We often express our positive characters in a vacuum, paving the road for them with carpets, pushing away the wood on their roads with our own hands, and filling in the pits in front of them. We sometimes pull bad and dangerous people aside from the broad road that positive characters pass through. In this way, we deprive positive characters of the real difficulties in the struggle against those ugly and backward things. We admit the existence of ugly and backward things in principle, but it is not reflected in the struggle of characters.
    Precisely because of this, our positive characters in many cases become formulaic, without personality and passion; there are many fictional difficulties and fragile enemies in literature. Therefore, the power of characters in fighting against them cannot be expressed.
    The Party calls on us to observe life more deeply, understand life, and show how the advanced fights against the backward, the new fights against the old and outdated, and how the new overcomes them. However, some playwrights understand the call to express the dark side of life and bad people as an isolated task, forgetting the purpose of doing so. We should express the bad and dark in art, but not for the sake of expressing them, but to use artistic tools to eliminate this ugliness in life. If we agree that the only purpose of describing ugliness in literature is to eliminate it—we cannot disagree with this—, then we will come to the conclusion that the most obvious thing is to describe how the advanced defeats the backward and how good people and positive characters oppose bad people in life and around us. Because there is no more effective and more accurately in line with what is really happening in life now!
    Some time ago, we had overly serious discussions on the question of whether there can be only negative characters in comedy? We specifically discussed S. Mikhalkov's popular comedy "Lobster," and the enthusiasm at that time was like talking about the general line of our theatrical creation. In fact, this popular comedy (in which the author put all the negative characters on the stage) is, in my opinion, irrelevant to the main path of theatrical creation development. This is a minor matter, and there is no need to study it theoretically, so as to deviate from serious consideration of the path of our theatrical development.
    Obviously, some people will refute this point: "Then what about Gogol's great comedy 'The Inspector General'? How to treat Gogol's tradition?"
    You know, inheriting tradition is one thing, and mechanically transporting drama techniques is another.
    When talking about modern satire, it should be linked to Gogol's tradition. What is referred to here is the power and heat of this satire, rather than simply applying Gogol's plot, just like various other plots related to different historical eras and different social relations cannot be applied.
    Yes, Gogol was unable to create the kind of image that could confront the mayor and landlords in his era. It should be added that this is where he as an artist was not satisfactory.
    But, please ask, can real Soviet artists and Soviet playwrights living in our time encounter similar problems? Do they need to suffer and painstakingly seek characters who have sufficient strength to confront hypocrites? Aren't there advanced good people around us? Who else but them will relentlessly destroy those bureaucrats and careerists who hide, disguise, and run into walls everywhere? Few people would object to this. But if this is the case, then please ask: where does that fictitious theoretical question—whether you can write a comedy with only negative characters—come from? What is the enthusiasm for treating this very small thing as a problem?
    Gorky wrote in "On Socialist Realism" with great respect for and pride in the Soviet people:
  "We live in a happy country with lovely and respectable people."
    Unfortunately, sometimes there is a feeling that some of our playwrights neither understand Gorky's words, nor, worse, do they understand what Gorky said and the country in which they live.
    If we talk about Gorky's tradition of theatrical creation, then it is difficult to find another example in literary history who loved strong, cheerful, and healthy people so much and despised all kinds of scoundrels so much. Gorky was still in that Russia on the edge of the 20th century, and he could not only use his Nil [Note 1] to confront the world of petty citizens, but also make him the accuser and judge of this world.
    As for those playwrights who are now nagging that they are almost complying with Gorky's legacy of exposing petty citizens, but in fact they have failed to fully express the people who destroy the remnants of petty citizens and various capitalistic despicable behaviors in our real life in their scripts.
    Some of these playwrights inappropriately quote Mayakovsky's words and bravely declare that they are sanitation workers and water carriers. However, they forgot the most important thing—Mayakovsky knew why he called himself a sanitation worker and water carrier: he created the image of the holder of the Soviet passport, the Soviet citizen in capital letters, with great strength, and it was from the standpoint of this citizen that he destroyed ugliness and scoundrels.
    No wonder Mayakovsky's satirical play "The Bathhouse," which is now being staged, is such a success. In this play, he gives ruthless reprimands to all bureaucrats and those who play all sides after many years, and he annihilates them as a person who can see the future.
    The question of the number of positive and negative characters in drama in general, especially in comedy, is not a very important question. I firmly believe that A. Korneichuk did not first calculate how many positive and negative characters he would write when writing his satirical play "The Front." What interested him was the essence of the matter—eliminating the "Gorlovs" in our army. He created this script in the best way to realize his creative ideas, and as a result, he was successful.
  The essence is not in the number of this or that character, but in what the author creates his script for; in whether he truly hates his negative characters or just pretends to hate them and actually tolerates them or even likes them; and whether he truly loves his positive characters wholeheartedly or coldly puts them on the stage for artistic balance.
    Recently, some playwrights and critics have put forward a strange "either/or" argument: which is better, a comedy with no positive characters at all or a comedy with weak positive characters? At the same time, these situations where negative characters are portrayed as vivid people in comedy and positive characters are portrayed as formulaic people are almost considered a rule. In order to maintain this weird argument, classical examples are even put forward: Nerilin in "Kreichinsky's Wedding" is put forward as the "eternal model" of positive characters in comedy, and positive characters are like this in the past, present, and future.
    Honestly, if Sukhovo-Kobylin [Note 2] could not use real positive characters to confront the talented bad guy Kreichinsky based on the conditions and his views at that time, then why put Soviet comedy in the same situation?
    Moreover, do we lack talented and witty people who expose bad examples in our real life (not only have correct views on things in general, but also have significant advantages over bad examples in terms of personality, talent, and human influence)? There are many such people around us, but it is puzzling why they have not appeared in our comedies!
    I will give an example that seems to refute what I said above at first glance. In V. Minko's comedy "Unnamed," the negative characters are written more beautifully than the positive characters. Nevertheless, this comedy is generally successful. Ah, why is this? This comedy was successful because the exposure of the negative characters was not done with some great principles, but with the life process itself, and in front of the positive characters are some fools, although the positive characters are not written in enough detail, the audience sympathizes with them. This is the first point.
    Second, if V. Minko had more talent, beautifully and humorously, I especially emphasize this—humorously, portrayed his positive characters, then we would be dealing with not just a simply successful comedy, but a good comedy.
    The task of exposing negative characters is placed to varying degrees in front of every artist who hopes to write the truth of life without avoiding sharp angles and dark sides. The scale of attention that artists pay to exposing this kind of negative characters cannot be stipulated by orders: many things depend on the artist's personality and the nature of the life phenomena that the artist pays attention to. But one thing is undoubted: the power of the artist's good ideals should be fully expressed in any work. We should feel the artist's trembling due to hatred and contempt for that kind of scoundrel. He has to—yes, has to—grab the ears of this kind of scoundrel and pull them to the sun, pull them out just to eliminate them, not to collect them.
    If the scoundrels are only expressed but not exposed, or are only formally exposed but cannot arouse the audience's sense of contempt and hatred, it is a scandal in literature. Only expressing the negative in the collection means doing something harmful to society. Those who do this are often people who find a suitable reason for themselves under the guise of criticizing the dark side of our lives and reveal the inner vulgarity they have accumulated over the years under the pretext of performing social responsibilities.
    When reading scripts like A. Mariengof's "Crown Prince," one never feels that the author had to pull them out because he wanted to eliminate these scoundrels and mold. On the contrary, sometimes it seems that if these scoundrels and mold were eliminated, then the author would not know what to ridicule and what to write, because everything else is of no interest to him.
    Scripts like this, which we have justly pointed out, are examples of truly conflict-free drama creation, because although one can speculate that justice seems to have been won in these dramas, the victory of this justice is only outside the stage. Outside the stage, someone somewhere passed a resolution on removing the positions of careerists and bureaucrats. Outside the stage, someone exposed the despicable people. Somewhere outside the stage, it is hinted that there is a force that can defeat the despicable people who appear on the stage. But on the stage, the real struggle does not occur. On the stage, the author puts all his energy into expressing despicable people more amusingly and with more interest, while their opponents—good people—become fleshless people under the rough strokes, thus greatly distorting our reality. For example, this is the case with L. Zorin's "Guests." Many literary figures, including the author of this article, did not immediately reveal the harmful nature of this script.
    Summarizing this type of false script, one will come to the conclusion that the negative characters in the script really exist in flesh and blood, while the positive characters are only present and cannot defeat ugliness with their own strength, but only look forward to external assistance.
    What else is this if it is not that theory of conflict-free drama creation that we have opposed in the past and will oppose in the future!
    It is certainly true that the Soviet regime and the Soviet people have always successfully defeated all kinds of despicable people and alien people, active preservers of various capitalistic remnants, and patients with capitalistic infectious diseases, but this truth is well known even without the help of playwrights. How to specifically expose and destroy bad people and alien elements in our lives, this is what the audience hopes to see on the stage!
    In real life, all the advantages belong to the true Soviet people. They are the majority, because they are also the vast majority of the people. They are smarter and more powerful. They win not entirely by relying on the sketches in the central newspapers and the resolutions of the state committees. On the contrary, the sketches in the central newspapers or the relevant resolutions exposing bad people are the result of the actions, work, and struggle of Soviet patriots, people with noble communist morals and principles. In one case, they carry out this struggle to the point where sketches criticizing scoundrels and harmful behaviors appear. In another case, they carry out this struggle to the point where those who insult the title of Communist Party member receive the deserved social condemnation.
    If we imagine things to be another way—that is, imagine our people to be the kind of weak people with various shortcomings but seemingly unable to overcome that they are not, this is an incorrect concept of the strength of the character of our positive characters, the degree of their activeness, principles, and firmness. And the title of positive characters is the sons of the people, and their number is in the millions.
    When the voice of criticism is directed at literary figures who do not understand the full meaning of the tasks put forward by the Party to literature, then this criticism of them is not entirely because they have shown bad people: bad people should be shown. So criticizing them is also not entirely because they put ugliness on the stage: ugliness should be exposed, not concealed. So criticizing them is because they have not shown how this ugliness is actually exposed in life by the hands of the Soviet people. The Soviet people are building a new world, mastering the great weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and they themselves, with their own strength and regime, thoroughly clear away the bad people in society and sweep away the ugliness from their path.
    If this is not the case, we will not be able to build a new, communist society, but we are building it and building it victoriously!
    What is referred to here is by no means like dispensing a medicine in a pharmacy—how much good and how much bad. What is referred to here is: does the writer know the life of our society, does he understand it, does he see its development prospects, or does he not understand, not know, not see this prospect? He talks about his belief in our system and the victory of our ideology in vain, or does he see how and why this system and this ideology win in concrete and vivid people?
    Dramatic creation without vigorous, spiritually beautiful, and beloved positive characters is as empty, tasteless, and even impossible as life without good people!
    So when thinking of many dramas that have appeared recently, it is by no means accidental that we first think passionately and excitedly of the vivid characters of real Soviet people, portrayed in struggle and movement. You can think of Pavlik Tuchkov, the undaunted passionate man, and Lyusha Veternikova, the gentle, moving, and unyielding woman, in A. Arbuzov's "Wandering Years." You can recall the taciturn and strong Sherikhov, who died physically but won in the struggle, in A. Sarysky's "Dangerous Companion." You can remember Yekaterina Topilina in A. Sofronov's play "The Heart Does Not Forgive," a woman who relies on her spiritual strength, courage, and principles to deal with the deepest personal pain.
    When talking about the status of positive characters in our theatrical creation and the principles of portraying bad phenomena and examples, we should firmly emphasize that what we call for is not to ease criticism, but to strengthen criticism.
    It is incorrect and harmful to separate the issue of describing positive characters and the issue of describing negative characters in our literature; if one issue is not correctly understood, then the other issue will not be correctly understood either.
    It is also incorrect and harmful to attempt to completely ignore these issues and integrate the concepts of positive and negative characters into the objectivist concept of "simple living people," that is, ordinary people who are neither bad nor good.
    The task of our literature is determined by the task of building a communist society. By studying the documents of the 19th National Congress of the Party and the resolutions of the plenary session of the Party Central Committee, our artists will see all the power and uncompromising nature of the criticism contained in these documents of the Party. But if some of us do not see that all these criticisms are based on a realistic evaluation of our strength and our prospects, are based on putting forward hundreds of thousands of concrete good examples, are based on objectively and comprehensively considering all the historical victories we have won and the good things that are happening now, are based on deep belief in the power of our system, the Party, and the people, then such a person is blind.
    Only the blind and deaf do not understand how all this is directly related to the tasks of literature. It is inconceivable to write the truth of our society without taking the description of that good and decisive thing as the center. The good and decisive thing determines the progress of society. It is precisely by relying on this power that we can raise questions about our shortcomings and weaknesses so straightforwardly and resolutely, and raise questions about shortcomings and weaknesses in life and literature.

### 生活里主要的就是戏剧创作中主要的

专栏：

    生活里主要的就是戏剧创作中主要的
    苏联　康·西蒙诺夫
    编者按：苏联第二届全苏作家代表大会将在本年内召开。在目前筹备期间，苏联报刊上陆续登载了一些关于文艺创作和批评中的若干原则性问题的评论，本文就是其中之一。西蒙诺夫在这里批评了部分作家对于创造正面和反面人物形象所持的违反文学的党性原则的错误观点，即：怀疑艺术创造中的典型化方法，认为作家应该“按人的原样”来进行描写，认为把人物分为正面和反面就会产生公式主义。中国文艺界在关于创造正面人物典型形象的论争中，也曾经发生过一些类似的混乱思想，出现过所谓在生活中找不到英雄人物等等论调。本文可供我国文艺工作者的参考。
    在第二届全苏作家代表大会的前夕，当默默地回顾一下我们的文学工作和估量一下我们戏剧创作的还不能令人满意的情况时，就很自然地会提出正面人物的形象在我们戏剧中占有怎样的地位这一问题。
    在各种文学讨论会和会议的讲台上，特别是在第十四次苏联作家协会理事会的全体会议上和关于
  “现代戏剧中正面人物的地位”的讨论会上，有人对于把人物分为正面和反面的规律性本身表示怀疑。他们说：这是一种公式主义呀，要知道在生活里我们不能把人分为正面的和反面的，我们周围都是具有各种性格的人，为什么把活生生的生活变成公式呢？应当就人的原样来描写他们，这样，真实就会自然而然地得到了。
    骤然看来，这些论调是动听的，但本质上却是腐朽的，这些论调是企图修正社会主义现实主义的方法，怀疑艺术中生活现象典型化的必要性，忘记了文学中的党性原则。
    当然，生活就是生活，活人就是活人。但是难道在评价我们生活的事件时，我们就不指出某些现象是先进的，另外一些是落后的吗？难道我们不去评定某些人的行为是良好的榜样，而另一些人的行为是不良的吗？再说，难道谈到有优点也有缺点的人们，我们能不说有一些人是在成长，变好，克服着自身的弱点吗？难道能不说还有一些人是在变坏，甚至有时在堕落和失去他曾有过的优点吗？
    同时，使我们感兴趣的，不是一个人身上的善良与丑恶的抽象的斗争；我们重视一个人有利于共产主义建设的活动，同时我们谴责一个人在主观上或客观上损害我们共同事业的行为。根据这个准则，我们在实际生活中有意识地特别指出良好的榜样，揭示不良的例子，并把某一些作为效法的对象，把另外一些作为暴露的对象。这样，任何人都不会责难我们是公式化地处理生活现象和机械地把生活加以分类的。
    但是，当谈到文学，特别是戏剧创作的时候，在批评中就开始潜入对客观主义，对罗列现象和下面这种说法的鼓励，说什么：人是活人，而且所有的人一方面是这样，另一方面则是那样，归根到底，每一个人都是对的！这种客观主义时常是在争取生活的真实的斗争口号下被窃用的。最近“新世界”杂志上发表的许多文章中，就包含了伪装得不好的类似这样的观点的说教。
    自然，争论的并不在于名词。企图取消我们文学中的正面人物这一概念，并不是探讨名词的天真的结论。不是的，这是顽固地不愿承认这个原理：在我们生活中占优势的良好的部分及其体现者——正面人物，是我们文学的核心。良好的部分所占的这种优势，也就是我们社会主义文学中那种新的东西，脱离了这一点来谈社会主义现实主义是徒劳无益的。
    这并不是说，在过去的伟大的文学作品中就没有正面人物的形象。但正面人物在苏联文学中占有的那种地位，从质量上来看是一个新的地位，这个地位是和我们社会的本质相关联的。
    党批评文学家的粉饰现实的现象，党号召我们去创作讽刺作品，去揭露坏人，揭露一切腐朽的，过时的。但是，是不是所有的文学家，特别是剧作家，都从这种批评中作出正确的结论来了呢？
    根据许多剧本看来，显然远非如此。有些剧作家忘记了，我们生活的良好的一面、正面人物无论在任何情况下，过去和现在都是文学注意的主要对象，都是文学热爱的对象，英勇的共产主义建设者的高贵形象无论过去和将来都是优秀的苏联文学作品的核心，而且党屡次向作家指出了这点。
    党和党的报刊一方面批评我们文学家常常离开对生活的真实描写，躲避生活的阴暗面，另一方面指示给我们一条富有成效的道路，沿着这条道路前进，我们就能最鲜明地表现出我们时代的人物的完全面目，就能在他们的事业中、在他们同一切还在阻碍建设共产主义社会的东西进行经常的斗争中来表现他们。
    我们常常在真空中来表现我们的正面人物，用地毡为他们铺好道路，亲手推开他们道路上的木头，并填平他们面前的坑。我们有时把坏人和危险的人从正面人物走过的那条宽敞的道路上拉到一边去。这样我们就剥夺了正面人物与那些丑恶和落后的事物的斗争的真正困难，我们原则上承认了丑恶与落后事物的存在，可是并没有体现在人物的斗争中。
    正因为如此，我们的正面人物在许多情况下，就成为公式化的、没有性格和热情的人；在文学中就有了很多虚构的困难和脆弱的敌人。因而也表现不出人物在同它们进行斗争中的力量。
    党号召我们要更深刻地观察生活，了解生活，并表现出生活中先进的如何与落后的斗争，新的如何与旧的、过时的斗争，以及新的如何战胜它们。但是有些剧作家把表现生活的阴暗面和坏人的号召，理解为一种孤立的任务，而忘记了所以这样做的目的。我们应当在艺术中表现坏的和黑暗的，但不是为了表现它们，而是为了借助艺术工具去消灭生活中的这种丑恶。如果我们同意我们在文学中描写丑恶的唯一目的是为了消灭它——不能不同意这一点——，那么我们就会得出这样一个结论：最明显不过的就是要描写，在生活中，在我们周围，先进的怎样战胜落后的，好人、正面人物怎样反对坏人。因为再也没有更有成效的和更确切地符合现在真正发生在生活中的事物的道路了！
    前些时候我们曾过分认真地讨论过这个问题：喜剧里是不是可以只有反面人物？我们曾特别讨论了斯·米哈尔科夫的通俗喜剧“龙虾”，当时讨论的那种热情就好像是谈到我们戏剧创作的总路线一样。其实，这个通俗喜剧（在这个剧作里作者搬上舞台的全是反面人物）依我看来，是与戏剧创作发展的主要道路无关的。这是件小事情，无须从理论上来研究它，以致反而离开了认真地考虑我们戏剧发展的道路。
    显然，有些人会来反驳这点的：“那么果戈理的伟大的喜剧‘钦差大臣’怎么样呢？怎么对待果戈理的传统呢？”
    要知道，继承传统是一回事，机械地搬运戏剧手法又是一回事。
    当谈到现代讽刺时，应当把这种讽刺和果戈理的传统联系起来，这儿所指的是这种讽刺的力和热，而不是简单地运用果戈理的情节，就好像不能运用其他各种和别的历史时代、和别的社会关系有关的情节一样。
    是的，果戈理没有能够创造出在他那个时代能够和市长和地主对立的那种形象。这一点应当补充说，这就是他作为一个艺术家所不能令人满意的地方。
    但是，请问，生活在我们时代的真正的苏联艺术家，苏联剧作家，能不能发生类似这样的问题呢？难道他们需要苦恼和苦苦寻求有充分力量和伪善者对立的人物吗？难道在我们周围没有先进的好人吗？不是他们而又是谁会无情地摧毁那些隐藏起来、伪装起来和处处碰壁的官僚和野心家呢？未必有人反对这点吧。但是如果是这样，那么请问：那种虚构的理论问题——能否写只有反面人物的喜剧——从何而起呢？把这个非常小的事情当作是个问题的那种热情是怎么回事呢？
    高尔基在“论社会主义现实主义”一文中，怀着对苏联人非常崇敬和为他们而自豪的心情写道：
  “我们生活在有可爱和可尊重的人的一个幸福的国家里。”
    可惜，有时就有这样的感觉：我们有些剧作家既不了解高尔基的这句话，更坏的是，也不了解高尔基所说的和他们所生活在其中的这个国家。
    如果谈到高尔基的戏剧创作传统，那么在文学史中很难找到另一个像他这样酷爱强壮的、开朗的、健康的人和如此蔑视所有的和各种各样败类的榜样。高尔基还在二十世纪边缘的那个俄国，就不仅能够用自己的尼尔〔注一〕来对抗小市民的世界，而且使他成为这个世界的控诉人和审判官。
    至于那些剧作家呢，他们现在唠叨说，他们几乎是遵守着高尔基揭露小市民的遗训，而事实上在他们的剧本中未能充分表现出摧毁我们真实生活中的小市民的残余和各种资本主义卑鄙行为的残余的人。
    这些剧作家中有些人不适当地引用马雅可夫斯基的话，勇敢地宣称自己是除秽者和运水人。但是他们忘记了最主要的—马雅可夫斯基知道为什么他把自己称为除秽者和运水人：他以巨大的力量创造了苏联护照的持有者，大写字母的苏联公民的形象，而且正是从这种公民的立场摧毁了丑恶和败类。
    无怪乎现在上演的马雅可夫斯基的讽刺剧“澡堂”是这样的成功，他在这个剧本中，在过了许多年以后给所有的官僚和左右逢源的人以无情的叱责，而且他以一个能远瞻未来的人的身份来歼灭他们。
    关于一般地在戏剧中，特别是喜剧中的正面人物和反面人物的数目问题是一个不甚重要的问题。我深信，阿·柯尔涅楚克在写自己的讽刺剧“前线”时，不会先计算他要写出几个正面人物和几个反面人物。使他发生兴趣的是事情的实质—消灭我们军队中的“戈尔洛夫们”，他是按照对于实现他的创作构思最好的方式来创作了这个剧本，结果他获得了成功。
  　实质并不在于这种或那种人物的数目，而在于作者为了什么来创造自己的剧本；在于他是真正仇恨自己的反面人物或只是装着仇恨他们的样子而实际上对他们容忍、甚至对他们发生好感呢？以及他是真正全心全意爱自己的正面人物或者是为了艺术上的均衡而冷漠地把他们拉上舞台呢？
    近来，有些剧作家和批评家提出一个奇怪的“二者选一”论：完全没有正面人物的喜剧和有软弱的正面人物的喜剧，哪一种好一些？同时在喜剧中把反面人物表现成为生动的人，把正面人物表现成为公式化的人的这些情况，几乎被认为是一种规律。为了维护这种怪论甚至提出古典的范例：“科列钦斯基的婚礼”中的涅里金就是作为喜剧中正面人物的“永远的典范”而提出来的，正面人物在过去、现在和将来都是这样的。
    老实说，如果苏豪沃—科贝林〔注二〕根据他那时候的条件和他的观点而不能在他的喜剧中使真正的正面人物来和有才能的坏人科列钦斯基对立，那么为什么使苏联的喜剧也陷于这同一境遇呢？
    再者，难道我们缺乏那些揭露我们现实生活中坏的典型的有才能的和机智的人（不仅一般地对事物有正确观点，而且在性格、才能、人的感化力方面都较坏典型占显著优势）吗？我们周围有很多这样的人，可是令人难解的就是为什么他们没有出现在我们的喜剧之中！
    我举一个例子，这个例子乍看起来好像驳倒了我上面所说的。在沃·明科的“不提姓名”的喜剧中，反面人物比正面人物写得更漂亮。虽然如此，这个喜剧一般是成功的。啊，这是为什么呢？这个喜剧之所以获得了成功，是因为反面人物的揭露不是用一些大道理，而是用生活过程本身，并且在正面人物的面前是一些蠢货，尽管正面人物写得不够细致，可是观众是同情他们的。这是第一点。
    第二点，如果沃·明科更有才干地、漂亮地和幽默地，我特别强调这个—幽默地，刻画了自己的正面人物，那么我们打交道的不是一个单单成功的喜剧，而是一个好的喜剧了。
    揭露反面人物的任务，程度不同地摆在希望写生活的真实情况而不回避锐角和阴暗面的每个艺术家的面前。艺术家对于揭露这种反面人物所注意的尺度，不可能用命令来规定：很多事情取决于艺术家的个性和艺术家所注意到的生活现象的性质。但是有一点是无疑问的：艺术家的良好理想的力量，应当充分表现在任何一部作品里。我们应当感觉到艺术家由于憎恨和蔑视那种败类而发生的颤栗，他不得不——是的，正是不得不——揪住这种败类的耳朵拉到阳光下，拉出来就是为了消灭他们，而不是搜集。
    如果败类只是被表现出来的，而不是被揭露出来的，或只是形式上被揭露出来的但不能在观众身上引起蔑视和憎恨感，是文学中的丑事。只在搜集中表现反面的，就是意味着作了一件有害于社会的事。这样做的，时常是这样一些人：他们在指责我们生活的阴暗面的幌子下为自己找到一个适当的理由，借口执行社会职责就把自己多年积下的内心的庸俗都透露了出来。
    当读到像阿·马里也恩戈夫的“皇太子”这类剧本时，绝不会感到，作者是因为想消灭这些败类和霉霉才不得不拉出它们来的。相反地，有时好像觉得，如果这种败类和霉霉被消灭了，那么作者就会不知道要讥笑什么，写什么，因为其他一切对他是没有兴趣的。
    像我们已公正地指出来的类似这样的剧本，就是真正无冲突戏剧创作的例子，因为虽然在这些戏剧中可以推测到正义好像也胜利了，但是这种正义的胜利只是在舞台以外。在舞台以外，某人某地通过了关于解除野心家们和官僚们的职位的决议，在舞台以外有人揭露了卑鄙的人，在舞台以外什么地方暗示有一种能够战胜舞台上出现的卑鄙的人的力量的存在，但是在舞台上，真正的斗争是没有发生。在舞台上，作者把全力都放在更有风趣、更兴致勃勃地来表现卑鄙的人，而他们的反对者——好人——在粗略的几笔勾画下成为了一种没有血肉的人，因而大大地歪曲了我们的现实。例如拉·左林的“客人”就是这样，许多文学家，其中也包括本文作者都没有能立刻揭露出这个剧本有害的本质。
    总结一下这一类虚伪的剧本，就会得到这样一种结论：剧本中的反面人物确实存在于血肉之中，而正面人物仅仅是在场，不能用自己的力量来战胜丑恶，只是指望着外来的援助。
    这不是我们过去曾反对的和将来也要反对的那种无冲突的戏剧创作理论，还会是什么呢！
    苏维埃政权、苏联人民归根到底总是成功地战胜着各种卑鄙的人和异己的人，各种资本主义残余的积极保存者和资本主义传染病患者，这当然是真实，但是这个真实即使没有剧作家的帮助也是众人皆知的。在我们生活中如何具体地揭露和摧毁坏人和异己分子，这就是观众希望在舞台上看到的！
    在真实的生活中，一切优势是属于真正的苏联人这一方面的。他们占大多数，因为他们也是人民中的绝大多数。他们是更聪明的和更有力的，他们所以战胜，并不完全是依仗中央报刊上的小品文和州委会的决议，相反地，中央报刊上的小品文或揭露坏人的有关决议，是苏联爱国者、具有高尚共产主义道德和原则性的人的行动、工作和斗争的结果，在一种情况下，他们把这种斗争进行到斥责败类和危害行为的小品文的出现为止，另一种情况下就是把这种斗争进行到侮辱共产党员称号的人们受到应得的社会舆论的谴责为止。
    如果把事情想像成为另外一种样子——就是说把我们的人想像成为不是他们所具有的那种软弱的带有各种劣点但又似乎是无力克服的人。这就是对于我们的正面人物的性格的力量，对于他们的积极性、原则性和坚强性的程度有不正确的概念。而正面人物的称号是人民的儿子，他们的数目是数以百万计的。
    当批评的声音针对那不了解党给文学所提出来的任务的全部意义的文学家时，那么对他们的这种批评完全不是因为他们表现出了坏人：坏人是应当表现出来的。所以批评他们也完全不是因为他们把丑恶搬上了舞台：丑恶应当揭穿，而不要隐讳不谈，所以批评他们是因为他们没有表现出了这种丑恶实际上是怎样在生活中被苏联人的手所揭露，苏联人在建设新的世界，掌握着批评与自我批评这一伟大武器，他们自己，用自己的力量和政权彻底肃清着社会里的坏人并从自己的道路上扫除丑恶。
    如果事情不是这样，我们就不能够建设新的，共产主义的社会，而我们在建设并且在胜利地建设着它！
    这里所指的绝不是像药铺里配一剂药一样——有多少好的，有多少坏的。这里所指的是：作家是不是知道我们社会的生活，是否理解它，是否看到它的发展远景，还是不理解，不知道，看不出这种远景。他是空谈他相信我们的制度，我们的思想的胜利，还是在具体的生动的人身上看到这种制度、这种思想如何和为什么战胜。
    没有朝气蓬勃的，精神上美丽的，为我们所爱戴的正面人物的戏剧创作，就像没有好人的生活那样空虚、无味、甚至是不可能的！
    所以当想起最近出现的许多戏剧的时候，首先就会热情地和激动地想到真正苏联人的生动的，在斗争和运动中刻划出来的性格，这绝不是偶然的。你可以想起阿·阿尔布左夫的“漂泊的年代”里的巴夫里科·图奇科夫这个不气馁的热情人和温柔动人的同时又不屈不挠的柳霞·维捷尔尼科娃。你可以记起阿·萨雷斯基的“危险的伴侣”中的肉体上死亡了的，但在斗争中战胜了的，寡言的和坚强的谢里豪夫。可以记住阿·索夫罗诺夫的剧本“心不饶恕”剧中的叶卡切丽娜·托皮里娜，她是一个依靠着自己的精神力量、勇敢和原则性处理好个人最深重的痛苦的女人。
    当谈到我们戏剧创作中正面人物的地位和描绘不良现象和典型的原则时，就应当坚决强调指出我们号召的不是缓和批评，而是加强批评。
    把我们文学中描写正面人物的问题和描写反面人物的问题分开，这是不正确的和有害的；对一个问题不能正确地理解，那么对另外的一个问题也不会有正确的理解。
    企图根本忽视这些问题，把正面人物和反面人物的概念融合在“单纯的活人”即不坏也不好的一般的人这一客观主义的概念之中，同样是不正确的和有害的。
    我们文学的任务是为建设共产主义社会的任务所规定的。学习了党的第十九次代表大会的文件、党中央委员会全体会议的决议，我们艺术家就会看到党的这些文件中所含有的批评的全部力量和不妥协性。但是我们之中如果有人看不见所有这些批评是以真实地评价我们的力量和我们的远景为基础的，是以提出成百成千的具体的良好榜样为基础的，是以客观地和全面地考虑到我们所获得的全部历史性胜利和现在发生的那种良好的事物为基础的，是以深信我们的制度、党和人民的力量为基础的，那么这种人就是瞎子。
    只有瞎子和聋子才不明白所有这些和文学任务有着怎样的直接关系。写我们社会的真实而不把描写那种良好的，决定性的东西作为中心，是不可思议的。良好的，决定性的东西规定社会的前进，正是依靠着这种威力才使我们能够这样直率和坚决地提出关于我们的缺点和弱点的问题，提出生活中和文学中的缺点和弱点的问题。（刘竞译自一九五四年七月四日苏联“真理报”）
