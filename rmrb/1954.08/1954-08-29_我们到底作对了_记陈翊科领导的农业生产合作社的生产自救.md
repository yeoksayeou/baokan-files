    "We Were Absolutely Right"
    —An Account of the Production Self-Salvation of the Agricultural Producers' Cooperative Led by Chen Yike
    By Our Correspondent Sun Zunian

    One night in mid-May, the rain was still falling incessantly. The elderly and female members of the agricultural producers' cooperative led by Chen Yike in Fucun Township, Yongxiu County, on the west bank of Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province, heard from the young dike-protecting members returning from the dike that "more than 100 mu of early rice paddies in the cooperative were waterlogged." But everyone did not lose heart and actively prepared to drain the water for rescue or replant late rice. By June, the heavens were still pouring down rain, and the water level of Poyang Lake was constantly rising. One night in late June, a huge wave whipped up by a storm broke through the cooperative's embankment, and the flood quickly inundated the polders and villages.

    All the cooperative members were mobilized, rowing wooden boats to transport grain, farm tools, livestock, furniture, clothes, and other items in an organized manner to the mountains by the lake, first temporarily setting up homes. However, at this time, the members were very pessimistic, some members, especially female members, sat at home and wept all day, and the cooperative cadres were also very uneasy. They said: "This time all the production increase plans are completely ruined." The cooperative chairman, Chen Yike, was also very sad. He kept thinking that I am a Communist Party member, and the Party has cultivated and educated me for three or four years. I should not bow my head in the face of difficulties. But what to do?

    One day, Chen Yike ran to the Yongxiu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and reported the situation of the agricultural producers' cooperative to the county committee. The responsible comrade of the county committee told him: The most important thing at present is to establish confidence in overcoming difficulties among the cadres and members, mobilize all the members to engage in production for self-salvation, unite together, and overcome natural disasters.

    After returning to the agricultural producers' cooperative, Chen Yike first convened a Party group meeting to convey the instructions of the county committee. After discussion, everyone was full of confidence. Then, a meeting of cooperative members was convened, and specific measures for production self-salvation were adopted: First, seize the time to sow late rice seeds so as to rush to plant late rice after the flood recedes. Second, reclaim wasteland and rush to plant autumn crops. Third, engage in sideline production. At the same time, the specific organization of labor was also carried out. The entire cooperative consisted of thirty-seven households, more than one hundred people, with thirty male laborers responsible for sowing late rice seeds and reclaiming wasteland, ten male laborers going to Lushan to repair the mountain climbing road, and female members responsible for raising pigs for the food company.

    But things did not go very smoothly.

    "What's the use of sowing if the water doesn't recede, isn't it just a waste of seeds and labor?" Cooperative member Chen Lide said dissatisfiedly while sowing.

    "I don't think reclaiming wasteland is reliable either, it's better to go out and do business," said the elderly cooperative member Hao Yijia one day after reclaiming wasteland for half a day, uttering such discouraging words.

    Some cooperative members also expressed their agreement, and they simply stopped working.

    At this time, it was noon, and when cooperative chairman Chen Yike saw this situation, he announced: "Okay, let's temporarily stop work and go home to eat, and we'll have another meeting in the afternoon to discuss it."

    In order to solve this problem, the cooperative held several meetings of cooperative members, and the members carried out fierce ideological struggles at the meetings. At the first meeting of cooperative members, the people who originally advocated doing business said: Reclaiming wasteland is laborious and cannot provide immediate relief, it is better to do business, which does not require much effort and can earn some cash. These opinions of theirs were opposed by the majority of cooperative members, who said: Doing business is trying to engage in speculation, is trying to exploit other disaster-stricken farmers, and is capitalist thinking. These sharp criticisms hit the ideological key points of Hao Yijia and other cooperative members who advocated doing business.

    Although this meeting failed to solve the problem immediately, it was a good education for the cooperative members who advocated doing business. In addition, cooperative chairman Chen Yike and vice-chairman Xiong Zhongli promptly held individual talks with them, which made them completely abandon the idea of doing business. At the last meeting of cooperative members, old member Hao Yijia said: "At the last meeting, everyone's opinions were very correct. Originally, I wanted to take the same path as when I went out to do business during the 1949 flood. At that time, I transported very cheap things from non-disaster areas to disaster areas and sold them to disaster-stricken farmers at very high prices. This is exploiting others' difficulties and is capitalist thinking. If everyone hadn't reminded me this time, I would have almost taken the wrong path again. We should carry out production for self-salvation well, do a good job in the cooperative's production, and fight against the flood."

    From then on, the agricultural producers' cooperative's production self-salvation movement has been smoothly carried out. Now the entire cooperative has reclaimed more than 30 mu of wasteland, planted sweet potatoes and buckwheat, and the late rice seedlings that have been sown have also emerged from the soil one or two inches high, presenting a green expanse on the mountains and below. Sideline production has also made great achievements. Seeing this scene, the members felt joy from the bottom of their hearts, and everyone said: "We were absolutely right." The surrounding seven mutual aid teams have also sent people to the cooperative to visit and requested to join this producers' cooperative.

    Now, along the Poyang Lake area, there has been cloudless and sunny weather for more than ten days, which has not been seen for a long time, and the lake water has been decreasing day by day. The members of the agricultural producers' cooperative led by Chen Yike are preparing to repair the embankment to prepare for future agricultural production and strive to achieve greater victories on the front of production self-salvation.

    “我们到底作对了”
    ——记陈翊科领导的农业生产合作社的生产自救
    本报记者　孙祖年
    五月中旬的一天夜晚，雨还在不停地下着，江西省鄱阳湖西岸永修县复村乡陈翊科领导的农业生产合作社年老的社员和妇女社员们，听到了从堤上回来的护堤青年社员说：“社里的早稻田内涝了一百多亩。”可是大家都没有泄气，积极准备排水抢救或补种晚稻。到了六月，老天还是一个劲地下着大雨，鄱阳湖的水也在不断上升。六月下旬的一个夜晚，暴风雨掀起的巨浪，把农业生产合作社的圩堤冲破了，洪水很快就把圩田和村庄淹没了。
    全体社员都动员起来了，驾着木船把粮食、农具、牲畜、家具、衣服等有组织地运到了湖边的山上，先临时安起家来。可是，这时社员们都很悲观，有的社员特别是女社员整天坐在家里哭泣，社干部心情也很不安。他们说：“这一下什么增产计划全完了。”社长陈翊科心里也很难过。他老是想着我是一个共产党员，党培养教育我三、四年了，在困难面前是不应该低头的。可是，怎么办呢？
    有一天陈翊科跑到了中共永修县委会，把农业生产合作社的情况向县委作了报告，县委负责同志告诉他：目前最要紧的，是要在干部和社员中间，树立起克服困难的信心，发动全体社员生产自救，团结起来，战胜自然灾害。
    陈翊科回到农业生产合作社后，首先召开了党小组会，传达了县委的指示。经过讨论，大家都充满了信心。接着又召开了社员大会，通过了生产自救的具体办法：一、抓紧时间播种晚稻种，以便洪水退后抢种晚稻。二、开垦荒地，抢种秋季作物。三、进行副业生产。同时，又进行了劳动力的具体组织。全社三十七户，一百多人，三十个男劳动力担负播种晚稻种和开荒，十个男劳动力去卢山修登山公路，女社员负责替食品公司养猪。
    但事情进行并不是很顺利的。
      “水退不下播种有什么用，还不是白糟踏了种籽和劳动力。”社员陈礼德在播种时不满意的说。
      “我看开荒也不稳当，不如出去做生意。”年老的社员郝宜家有一天开了半天的荒后说出了这样泄气的话。
    有些社员也表示同意，他们干脆停下来不干了。
    这时，正是中午，社长陈翊科看到这种情况，就宣布说：“好吧，暂时收工回家吃饭，下午再开个会讨论讨论。”
    为了解决这个问题，社里召开了几次社员大会，社员们在大会上进行了激烈的思想斗争。在第一次社员大会上，原来主张去做生意的人说：开荒费力又不能救急，不如去做生意，既不要费多大力气，又能赚些现钱。他们的这些意见遭到了大多数社员的反对，这些社员说：做生意是想搞投机，是想去剥削别的受灾的农民，是资本主义思想。这些尖锐的批评，正打中了郝宜家等主张做生意的社员的思想要害。
    这次会议虽然没能立即解决问题，但对主张做生意的社员是一次很好的教育，加上社长陈翊科，副社长熊中立又及时找他们进行了个别谈话，就使他们完全打消了做生意的念头。在最后一次社员大会上，老社员郝宜家说：“上次会议上，大家意见很对，原来我还想走一九四九年受水灾时出去做生意的路。那时把非灾区很便宜的东西贩到水灾区用很高的价钱卖给受灾农民，这是乘人之危的剥削行为，是资本主义思想。这次不是大家提醒我，险些儿又走了岔道。我们应该很好的进行生产自救，搞好社里的生产，和洪水斗争。”
    从此，农业生产合作社生产自救运动就顺利的开展起来了。现在全社已开出了荒地三十多亩，种上了红薯、荞麦，播种的晚稻秧苗也已出土一、二寸高，山上山下呈现了绿油油的一片。副业生产也有了很大的成绩。社员们看到这种情景，从内心里感到喜悦，大家都说：“我们到底做对了。”周围七个互助组也都派人来社参观，并要求参加这个生产合作社。
    现在，沿着鄱阳湖地区，已出现了十余天以来未有的万里无云晴朗的天气，湖水已逐日下降。陈翊科领导的农业生产合作社的社员们，正准备抢修圩堤为未来的农业生产作好必要的工作，争取在生产自救的战线上取得更大的胜利。
