Xinhua News Agency report: Agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei, Shaanxi, Fujian and Sichuan provinces are vigorously striving for increased autumn grain production.

    The CCP committees at all levels in Hebei Province are promoting current production in agricultural production cooperatives by launching patriotic production increase competitions. In Handan and Tianjin prefectures alone, eleven counties have 1,358 cooperatives participating in the competition. In Baoding and Shijiazhuang prefectures, because the movement started earlier, nearly 10,000 cooperatives have largely participated in the competition. After launching a weeding competition, the Red Flag Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mancheng County overcame the difficulties of wet land and abundant weeds, ensuring timely mid-season cultivation. After more than 7,000 cooperatives in Shijiazhuang Prefecture launched the competition, they formulated plans and sought fertilizer sources, ensuring that fertilizer was universally applied to 300,000 mu of cotton fields.

    More than 800 agricultural production cooperatives in Shaanxi Province are strengthening autumn field management and vigorously striving for a bumper autumn harvest. In Guanzhong, many agricultural production cooperatives have weeded their cotton fields three to four times, and are now actively carrying out pruning and topping work. In the past, two-thirds of the 89 mu of corn in the "May 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baocheng County did not receive topdressing when it was a mutual aid team. This year, all of it has received topdressing.

    Agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Fujian Province have revised their production increase plans to strive to overfulfill their annual production increase tasks. The Lianban Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Minhou County strives to increase the autumn late rice production plan by 7.5 percent. At present, agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Fujian Province are launching a fertilizer accumulation campaign to increase topdressing. In revising the production increase plan, many agricultural production cooperatives have also formulated specific methods for improving harvesting methods in the autumn harvest, not wasting a single grain, and increasing the harvest yield.

    More than 700 agricultural production cooperatives and tens of thousands of mutual aid teams in the Jiangjin Prefecture of Sichuan Province have formulated plans to continue increasing grain production after the autumn harvest. The entire prefecture plans to cultivate 500,000 mu of regenerated rice, and before planting spring crops, use more than 300,000 mu of dry land and corn and sorghum land to increase planting of a season of short-term late autumn crops, striving to increase grain production by more than 89 million jin after this year's bumper harvest.

    加强田间管理争取秋田增产
    据新华社讯：河北、陕西、福建和四川等省农业生产合作社大力争取秋田增产。
    中共河北省各级党委正以开展爱国增产竞赛的方法，推动农业生产合作社作好当前的生产。仅邯郸、天津两个专区的十一个县，即有一千三百五十八个社参加了竞赛。保定、石家庄两个专区因为运动开展得比较早，约近一万个社大部都参加了竞赛。满城县红旗农业生产合作社展开锄地竞赛后，克服了地湿草多的困难，保证了及时中耕。石家庄专区的七千多个社展开竞赛后，经过订计划、找肥源，曾保证三十万亩棉田普遍追了肥。
    陕西省八百多个农业生产合作社加强秋田管理，大力争取秋田丰收。关中许多农业生产合作社的棉田已锄过三次到四次，现在正在积极进行整枝打卡工作。褒城县“五一”农业生产合作社的八十九亩玉米过去在互助组时有三分之二不施追肥，今年全部施了追肥。
    福建省各地农业生产合作社，纷纷修订增产计划，争取超额完成全年增产任务。闽侯县连坂村农业生产合作社，争取秋季晚稻比原订增产计划提高百分之七点五。目前福建省各地农业生产合作社，正展开积肥运动，增加追肥。许多农业生产合作社在修订增产计划中，并订出在秋收中改进收割方法，不浪费一颗粮食，提高收获量的具体办法。
    四川省江津专区七百多个农业生产合作社和几万个互助组，纷纷订立秋收后继续增产粮食的计划。全专区计划培育再生稻五十万亩，并在播种小春作物以前，利用旱田和玉米、高粱地三十多万亩，增种一季短期晚秋作物，争取在今年丰收之后，再增产粮食八千九百多万斤。
