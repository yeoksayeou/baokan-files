The propaganda and discussion of the draft constitution has been launched in Waiyu Township, Fu'an County, Fujian Province. The fishermen of Lumen Port in the township are filled with immense joy, singing the song of liberation on the sea. On the afternoon of July 10th, despite the strong wind at sea, fisherman representative Lian Hongxi, in order to meet everyone's demands, braved the wind and rain to row a small boat to the township government, requesting comrades from the work team to explain the contents of the draft constitution to the fishermen on the boats. In the evening, when the work team arrived at Lumen Port, more than ten fishing boats sailed in from all directions, surrounding the port. Everyone listened with smiling faces as the comrades from the work team spoke about the draft constitution. After the work team comrades finished speaking, the fishermen quickly started discussing it, each contributing their own thoughts. Fisherman representative Lian Hongxi recalled the suffering before liberation under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and contrasted it with the happy life after liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Once he started speaking, he couldn't stop: "In the past, the small areas of sea known as Yanfengbi and Dongqi had to pay landlord Shi Pinzhong 380 catties of rent grain every year. The landlords of Funing controlled the sea, and their law was: 'The land of Funing's sea, rent the fishing grounds before considering the land!' When fishermen sold their fish at Badu Street, they were cruelly exploited by the fish brokers with 'seven cuts and eight discounts' (the fish received was discounted by thirty percent, and the payment was discounted by twenty percent). We fishermen had nowhere to complain and were even scolded by the wealthy and officials: 'If a crooked hoof (referring to fishermen) climbs the mountain, no official will be found even if he is beaten to death.' How could anyone live like that in the old society? At that time, we fishermen were truly 'nine dead with no survivors.' After liberation, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to eliminate the Kuomintang remnants and pirates, and abolished the exploitation of the feudal fish brokers. From then on, there was no more rent to be paid for the sea. Not only that, but the People's Government also led us to develop production; knowing that we were poor, in 1952 they issued long-term loans of more than 7.3 million yuan, along with large quantities of clothing, bedding, and relief funds, greatly improving our lives. Thinking about the past and looking at the present, I firmly support the draft constitution." With such a comparison, everyone had a lot to say. Fisherman and militia squad leader Lian Tanxing continued: "In 1947, I was afraid of being drafted by the Kuomintang, so my whole family didn't dare stay in Lumen Port and sailed our fishing boat to Niaoyu Port. Unexpectedly, we encountered bandits who robbed us, and my grandfather died of illness as a result. It took three days after his death to buy a small piece of land to bury him. So my father often said to me: 'Our family was born without a tile to cover our heads and died without an inch of land to bury our bodies.' Now things are completely different. We fishermen are truly masters of our own affairs, and today we also have the right to participate in the discussion of the draft constitution. I must be vigilant and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to consolidate coastal defense." As the fishermen talked, they eventually turned to the topic of production. Fisheries mutual aid team leader Lian Naijiang was delighted when he heard that the draft constitution clearly described the bright future of socialism. He said happily:
"Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we fishermen follow the path of collectivization and move towards a socialist society. In 1952, we responded to Chairman Mao's call to organize, and in less than two years, we added six fishing boats and more than twenty fishing nets. Production has developed, and our lives have improved. In the future, we must respond even more actively to the government's call, work hard to produce, and strive to realize a socialist society as soon as possible." One fisherman after another expressed their opinions. Although it was late at night, the fishermen of Lumen Port continued their discussions.

    渔民的喜悦和心愿
　  王立斌
    宪法草案的宣传和讨论在福建省福安县外屿乡开展了，该乡炉门港的渔民一个个都充满着无比喜悦的心情，在海洋上欢唱着这一首翻身歌儿。七月十日下午，虽然海面上正刮着大风，渔民代表连红细为了满足大家的要求，冒着风雨，划小船赶到乡政府来，要求工作组同志到炉门港船上去给渔民们讲解宪法草案的内容。傍晚，工作组同志到达炉门港的时候，十多条渔船从四面八方扬帆赶来，团团围住了港口，大家笑容满脸地听工作组同志讲宪法草案。工作组同志讲完后，渔民们你一句、我一声很快就讨论开了。渔民代表连红细回想解放前在国民党反动统治时的痛苦，对比解放后在共产党、毛主席领导下的幸福生活，他的话一出口，就没个停：“过去岩峰鼻、东歧这两小块海埕，每年要向地主石品忠交租谷三百八十斤。福宁的地主掌握了海埕，开口就是一条法律：‘福宁海埕土，后看渔埕先约租！’渔民捕来的鱼，送到八都街出卖，要受到狠心的鱼牙行‘七折八扣’剥削（鱼货收进去要七折、价款付出来要八扣）。我们渔民有苦没处诉，还要受到财主、当官的骂：‘曲蹄（指渔民）爬上山，打死没见官’。旧社会这那是人过的日子？那时我们渔民真是‘十死九没活’。解放后共产党、毛主席领导我们消灭了国民党残匪、海贼，取消了封建鱼牙行的剥削，从此，海埕再也不要交租了。不但这样，人民政府并领导我们发展生产；知道我们底子空，一九五二年又发放了七百三十多万元的长期贷款，大批衣服、被帐和救济金，我们的生活大大改善了。想想过去，看看现在，我坚决拥护宪法草案。”这样的对比，谁心里也都有一大堆话要说。渔民、民兵分队长连坛兴接着说：“一九四七年，我怕国民党抓壮丁，我们全家不敢留在炉门港，把渔船开向鸟屿港，料不到碰上土匪抢劫，我祖父因此得病死去，死在船上三天后才买到一小块土地来埋葬。所以我父亲常对我说：‘我们家是 生无片瓦遮盖，死无寸土埋尸’。现在光景完全不同了，我们渔民真正当家作主，今天也有权利参加宪法草案的讨论，我一定要提高警惕，配合解放军巩固海防。”渔民们谈着，谈着，结果还是谈到生产上来。渔业互助组长连奶蒋听到宪法草案中把社会主义的美好前途都写得清清楚楚，他欢喜地说：
  “只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们渔民才能沿着合作化的道路，走向社会主义社会。我们在一九五二年响应毛主席组织起来的号召，不上两年就添置了六条渔船、二十多张渔网，生产发展了，生活也好过了。以后我们更要积极响应政府号召，努力生产，争取早日实现社会主义社会。”渔民们一个接着一个地发表着自己的意见，虽然夜深了，炉门港的渔民们还继续讨论着。
