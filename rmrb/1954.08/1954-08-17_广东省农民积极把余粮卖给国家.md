    Guangdong Farmers Actively Sell Surplus Grain to the State

    After the summer harvest, farmers in various parts of Guangdong Province actively fulfill their grain pre-purchase contracts and sell surplus grain to the state. By early August, the province had purchased and stored 600 million jin of rice.

    This year, Guangdong Province saw a general increase in early rice and other crops, with the new grain entering the market earlier. The vast majority of farmers are promptly delivering grain in accordance with their pre-purchase contracts. By the end of July, farmers in the western Guangdong region had delivered more than 540,000 dan of grain according to pre-purchase contracts, accounting for 50% of the total pre-purchase amount. Farmers in Chao'an County have delivered more than 95% of the pre-purchased amount. Farmers in the 14th District of Jieyang County completed the delivery of all pre-purchased grain in early July. In addition to delivering a batch of grain in accordance with the pre-purchase contracts, farmers in the First District of Luoding County sold an additional 170,000 jin of surplus grain in three days. After selling surplus grain, farmers used most of the money to purchase means of production, preparing to expand production and strive for a bumper late rice harvest.

    广东省农民积极把余粮卖给国家
    广东省各地农民在夏收以后，积极履行粮食预购合同，把余粮卖给国家。到八月初旬，全省收购入库的稻谷已经有六亿斤。
    今年广东省的早稻等普遍增产，新谷登场较早。广大农民都及时按照预购合同交售粮食。粤西区的农民到七月底已按照预购合同交售粮食五十四万多担，占预购总数百分之五十；潮安县农民交售的粮食已达预购数的百分之九十五以上；揭阳县第十四区农民在七月初就把预购粮全部交售完毕；罗定县第一区的农民除按照预购合同交售一批粮食外，还在三天内另外卖出余粮十七万多斤。农民卖出余粮以后，把大部分钱用来购买生产资料，准备扩大生产，争取晚稻丰收。
