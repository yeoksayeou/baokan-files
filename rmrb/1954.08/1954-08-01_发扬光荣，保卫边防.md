    Carry Forward Glory, Defend the Border
    Gu Yongwu, Regimental Commander of a Border Defense Unit of the People's Liberation Army, Combat Hero
    August 1st is a glorious festival. For twenty-seven years, the path our army has taken is the path led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, striving for liberation and achieving victory for the people of the whole country.
    On this glorious festival, like many comrades in the unit, I often recall many things.
    During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the predecessor of my current unit—the Teaching Division of the Fourth Red Army—was fighting in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui revolutionary base area against enemies who outnumbered us dozens of times. Thanks to the leadership of the Party, our ranks grew rapidly. During the transfer to the Sichuan-Shaanxi revolutionary base area, the unit crossed the snow-covered Qinling and Bashan mountains in thin clothes, crushing the Kuomintang reactionary armed forces who were blocking and pursuing us. On the arduous fighting and marching road, the leaders of the 73rd Division of the Red Army at that time gave up their riding animals for wounded and sick soldiers to ride. Comrade Hu Xiaowu, the political commissar of the division's health department, and many responsible cadres personally carried wounded class brothers on stretchers. In June 1935, my unit met with the Red Army led personally by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, which was heading north, in the Jiajin Mountain area of Ya'an, Xikang Province. I remember that Commander-in-Chief Zhu often walked with the soldiers to encourage us to move forward, which gave us great education. Food was very difficult during the Long March, but the fraternal units ahead often left food for the units behind. The troops of the Ninth Red Army would rather endure more hardship themselves and leave the animals for the units behind to transport the sick, wounded, and military supplies. For more than twenty years, the noble class friendship and the unity of officers and soldiers formed in our unit in combat life have been maintained and carried forward.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, when our unit and other fraternal units fought in the enemy's rear in North China, like it did during the Long March, it maintained flesh-and-blood ties with the people. Under the correct instructions of the Party, our army ate wild vegetables with the people in the Taihang and Taiyue Mountains, lived in cave dwellings, attacked blockhouses, destroyed railways, crushed the Japanese puppet army's "mopping up" operations, and finally defeated the enemy.
    This glorious tradition of maintaining constant and close contact with the masses is being strengthened and carried forward in the Third Revolutionary Civil War, in the task of guarding the frontier. Now, in the southwest border of the motherland, we are victoriously implementing the Party's national policy, helping all fraternal ethnic groups develop their economy, improve their culture, defend the motherland, and protect the peaceful and happy life of all fraternal ethnic groups, and have won the sincere support and love of all fraternal ethnic groups. We are also working hard to learn military technology and move towards the goal of a modernized national defense army. We must use the actions of carrying forward the glorious tradition to maintain the glorious tradition. We must make ourselves worthy of being a modern army defending the interests of all ethnic groups in the motherland.
    Recently, although the war in Indochina has stopped and the international situation has further eased, we clearly know that American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek's remnants, and domestic counter-revolutionaries are not reconciled to their failure. They are still trying to undermine our revolutionary achievements at all times. We have not forgotten that our sacred territory of Taiwan has not yet been liberated, and the American Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is carrying out conspiracies against the Chinese people there. We have full determination and confidence to complete the sacred task entrusted to us by the Party and the people: to defend the motherland and liberate Taiwan.

    发扬光荣，保卫边防
    解放军边防某部团长  战斗英雄  顾永武
    “八一”是个光荣的节日。二十七年来，我军所走的道路，是中国共产党和毛主席领导着全国人民争取解放并取得胜利的道路。
    每逢这个光荣的节日，我和部队中许多同志一样，往往会回忆起很多事情。
    在第二次国内革命战争时期，我现在所在的这个部队的前身——红四方面军教导师，正在鄂东南革命根据地和数量上大于我数十倍的敌人战斗。由于有党的领导，我们的队伍迅速成长壮大起来。在转战川陕革命根据地的途中，部队穿着单衣越过了风雪交加的秦岭和巴山，粉碎了反革命武装对我们的前堵后追。在艰苦战斗和行军的路上，当时红军七十三师的首长们交出了自己骑着的牲口，给负伤和生病的战士骑。师卫生处政治委员胡孝武同志和许多负责干部，都亲自用担架把战斗中负伤的阶级弟兄抬着走。一九三五年六月，我所在的部队在西康省雅安夹金山地区，与毛主席、朱总司令亲自带领北上的红军会师了，我记得，朱总司令常和战士一起徒步跋涉鼓励我们前进，给了我们极大的教育。长征途中的粮食是十分困难的，但走在前面的兄弟部队，还经常要给后面的部队留下粮食。红九军的部队宁肯自己多吃些苦，还把牲口留给后面的部队，以便后面的兄弟部队载运病员、伤员和军需物资。二十多年来，我们部队在战斗生活中结成的这种崇高的阶级友爱和官兵一致的作风一直在保持和发扬着。
    抗日战争时期，我们这个部队和其他兄弟部队转战华北敌后时，像它在长征中一样，和人民群众保持了血肉般的联系。我军在党的正确的指示下，和太行山区，太岳山区的人民一起吃野菜，钻窑洞，攻碉堡，破铁路，粉碎日伪军的扫荡并最后战胜了敌人。
    这种和群众保持经常和密切联系的光荣传统在第三次国内革命战争中，在执行守卫边疆的任务中，在继续加强着和发扬着。现在我们在祖国的西南边疆，正在胜利地执行着党的民族政策，帮助各兄弟民族发展经济，提高文化，保卫祖国，保卫各兄弟民族和平幸福的生活，得到了各兄弟民族衷心的拥护和爱戴。我们还在努力学习军事技术，向现代化国防军的目标迈进。我们要用发扬光荣传统的行动来保持光荣传统。我们要使自己不愧是一支保卫祖国各族人民利益的现代化军队。
    最近，印度支那的战争虽然停止了，国际形势虽然进一步缓和了，但是我们清楚地知道，美帝国主义、蒋介石残匪和国内反革命分子并不甘心他们的失败，他们还在时时刻刻企图破坏我们的革命胜利成果。我们更没有忘记，我国神圣领土台湾还没有解放，美蒋匪帮正在那里进行反对中国人民的阴谋活动。我们有充分的决心和信心来完成党和人民交给我们的神圣任务：保卫祖国，解放台湾。
