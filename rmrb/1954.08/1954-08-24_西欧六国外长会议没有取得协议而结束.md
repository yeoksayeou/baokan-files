Xinhua News Agency: The six-nation foreign ministers' conference on the "European Defense Community" discussed Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak's "counter-proposal" to the French proposal on the evening of August 20th. The French proposal called for "amendments" to the "European Defense Community" treaty that would not affect its substance; Spaak's "counter-proposal" aimed to urge the French Parliament to ratify the "European Defense Community" treaty without making any changes to it. Spaak suggested that the attendees issue a joint statement promising France that after ratifying and implementing the "European Defense Community" treaty in its current form, they would then study Mendes-France's "amendments."

Washington exerted new pressure on the French delegation, attempting to make the French Prime Minister make further concessions after agreeing to discuss Spaak's proposal.

American Ambassador to Belgium, Alger, interrupted his vacation on August 20th and rushed back to Brussels to meet with Mendes-France. David Bruce, the American representative to the "European Coal and Steel Community," also met with Mendes-France on the 21st. According to the Belgian "People's Daily," a letter from Dulles had been forwarded to the French Prime Minister, in which Dulles strongly advised Mendes-France to "make new efforts to prevent the European Defense Community from collapsing."

[Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd] TASS, Brussels, August 22nd: The six-nation foreign ministers' conference on the "European Defense Community," which lasted for four days, ended in Brussels on August 22nd. The conference was originally scheduled to end on August 20th, but was delayed for several days due to serious differences between the participating countries.

The meeting on August 21st began at 19:00 and ended late at night after six hours of debate. At this closed-door meeting, participants once again tried to reconcile Mendes-France's proposal to revise the details of the "European Defense Community" treaty without affecting its substance, and Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak's "counter-proposal." Spaak suggested that France first ratify the "European Defense Community" treaty without modification, and then review Mendes-France's "amendments" after the treaty came into effect.

However, this meeting was not successful.

According to newspaper reports, the United States, which ostensibly did not participate in the Brussels conference, engaged in frantic activity on August 21st. The French "Sunday Evening News" pointed out that Bruce, the American representative to the "European Coal and Steel Community," desperately pressured the participating countries, especially Mendes-France. Around 23:00 on the 21st, at the height of the meeting's debates, Bruce and the American Ambassador to Belgium, Alger, appeared at the foreign ministers' meeting place. They stayed in the meeting place for more than two hours, sitting there almost until the end of the meeting. The reason why the United States wanted to exert new pressure on the participants in the Brussels conference, especially Mendes-France, was to prevent the failure of the negotiations, that is, to accelerate the entry into force of the "European Defense Community" treaty, even though it was becoming increasingly clear that the "European Defense Community" was extremely unpopular in Western European countries.

At the same time, Churchill also gave Adenauer a letter, who was attending the Brussels conference, asking Adenauer to "try once again to reach a compromise agreement with France."

The closing meeting was held on the afternoon of August 22nd. The communiqué issued after the meeting stated that "although after lengthy discussions," the delegations of the six countries "still failed to reach a consensus." The communiqué specifically mentioned that the participants' "European policies" remained unchanged.

The Brussels conference, orchestrated by the United States with the aim of accelerating the revival of German militarism by establishing an exclusive military bloc of six European countries, has failed. Its failure proves yet another failure of American diplomacy. According to Washington newspapers, when the preliminary news of the end of the Brussels conference came, everyone had a feeling that a very serious diplomatic failure had occurred.

### 西欧六国外长会议没有取得协议而结束

    西欧六国外长会议没有取得协议而结束
    美国迫使“欧洲军”条约加速生效的外交阴谋破产了
    据新华社讯：“欧洲防务集团”六国外长会议在八月二十日晚间会议上讨论了比利时外交大臣斯巴克对法国建议的“反建议”。法国的建议要求对
  “欧洲防务集团”条约作不触及它的实质的“修正”；斯巴克的“反建议”的目的则是促使法国议会批准“欧洲防务集团”条约，而对它不作任何改变。斯巴克建议到会者发表一项联合声明，答应法国，在批准目前形式的“欧洲防务集团”条约并使之生效以后，再研究孟戴斯—弗朗斯的“修正案”。
    华盛顿对法国代表团施行了新的压力，企图使法国总理在同意讨论斯巴克的建议之后再作让步。
    美国驻比利时大使阿尔杰尔八月二十日中断了自己的休假，赶回布鲁塞尔和孟戴斯—弗朗斯会谈。美国在“欧洲煤钢联营集团”中的代表戴维·布鲁斯二十一日也会见了孟戴斯—弗朗斯。据比利时“人民报”报道，杜勒斯的一封信已被转交给法国总理，杜勒斯竭力建议孟戴斯—弗朗斯“作新的努力，使欧洲防务集团不致破产”。
    【新华社二十三日讯】　据塔斯社布鲁塞尔二十二日讯：延续了四天的“欧洲防务集团”六国外长会议，八月二十二日在布鲁塞尔结束了。这次会议原定在八月二十日结束，由于参加国之间的严重分歧而拖延了几天。
    八月二十一日的会议从十九时开始，经过六小时的辩论后在深夜结束。在这次秘密进行的会议上，与会者曾再次设法使孟戴斯—弗朗斯提出的关于修改“欧洲防务集团”条约的细节而不涉及这个条约的实质的建议，和比利时外交大臣斯巴克提出的“反建议”互相调和。斯巴克建议法国先不加修改地批准“欧洲防务集团”条约，在条约生效以后再来审查孟戴斯—弗朗斯的“修正案”。
    但是，这次会议并没有成功。
    据报纸报道，表面上没有参加布鲁塞尔会议的美国，在八月二十一日进行了狂热的活动。法国“星期晚报”指出，“欧洲煤钢联营集团”的美国代表布鲁斯拼命对会议参与国，首先是对孟戴斯—弗朗斯施加压力。二十一日二十三时左右，在会议争论最激烈的时候，布鲁斯和美国驻比利时大使阿尔杰尔出现在外长们的会场上。他们在会场上呆了两个多小时，差不多一直坐到散会。美国所以要对布鲁塞尔会议参加者，首先是对孟戴斯—弗朗斯施行新的压力，是为了要防止谈判失败，也就是为了要加速使“欧洲防务集团”条约生效，虽然“欧洲防务集团”在西欧各国极不得人心已越来越明显。
    同时，邱吉尔也给了出席布鲁塞尔会议的阿登纳一封信，要阿登纳“再一次试图和法国达成折衷的协议”。
    八月二十二日下午举行了闭幕会议，在会后发表的公报中写道，“虽然经过长久的讨论”，但六国代表团“还是未能取得一致意见”。公报中特别提到，参加会议者的“欧洲政策”不变。
    美国所策划的、目的在于用建立一个欧洲六国的排他性军事集团的办法来加速复活德国军国主义的布鲁塞尔会议是破产了。它的破产证明了美国外交的又一次失败。据华盛顿的报纸说，当关于布鲁塞尔会议结束的初步消息传来的时候，大家都有一种感觉：发生了十分严重的外交上的失败。
