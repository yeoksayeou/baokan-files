    Bai Shuanbao Excavation Team Completes Annual Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    The Bai Shuanbao excavation team, led by labor model Bai Shuanbao of the Longyan Iron Mine, completed its annual production task on the afternoon of July 24th, five months and seven days ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by 1.87%. After inspection by inspectors, the tunnel specifications met quality standards. Safe production was also achieved.
    Since February of this year, the workers of the Bai Shuanbao team have enthusiastically launched technological innovations, creating the "double wedge-shaped cross-cut method," which increased production efficiency by 30% and led to the early and over-fulfillment of the first-half plan on April 4th. They brought their creativity into play, overcame the difficulties of water in the tunnels, and constantly improved their operational techniques.
    Recently, during the study of the draft constitution, the team workers' enthusiasm for labor has increased even more. They have now proposed to complete another eight months of production tasks in the remaining five months of the second half of the year. (Li Zhenshan)

    白拴宝掘进小组提前完成全年生产计划
    龙烟铁矿劳动模范白拴宝掘进小组，已于七月二十四日下午提前五个月零七天，超过计划百分之一点八七完成了全年生产任务。经检收员检验，巷道规格合乎质量标准。并做到安全生产。
    从今年二月份以来，白拴宝小组工人热烈展开了技术革新，曾创造了“双楔形交叉掏槽法”，提高生产效率百分之三十，在四月四日提前超额完成了上半年计划。他们发挥创造性，战胜了坑道水多的困难，并不断改进了操作技术。
    最近在宪法草案学习中，小组工人的劳动热情更加高涨，又提出在下半年五个月中再完成八个月的生产任务。（李振山）
