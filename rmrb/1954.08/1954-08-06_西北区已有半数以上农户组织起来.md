More Than Half of Farmers in Northwest Region Have Organized
Since this spring, mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the Northwest region have greatly developed. As of now, approximately 3.3 million farmer households have been organized across the region, accounting for about 55% of the total rural households. In Shaanxi Province, the number of organized farmer households has reached 58.52% of the total farmer households, an increase of more than 10% compared to last year. Qinghai Province has the highest proportion of organized farmers, reaching 71.42%, an increase of more than 17% compared to last year. Permanent mutual aid teams in various areas have also improved and developed. In Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai provinces, and the suburbs of Xi'an City, the farmer households participating in permanent mutual aid teams account for over 17% of the organized farmer households. Before June, there were already 1,361 agricultural production cooperatives in the region. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have demonstrated even greater and more numerous advantages than in the past. In Guanzhong, Shaanxi, the average wheat yield of many agricultural production cooperatives is over 300 or 400 jin per mu, and even over 500 or 600 jin per mu. The Wangjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gangu County, Gansu, averaged 570 jin per mu, more than double the yield of last year.

In order to further consolidate and improve mutual aid and cooperation organizations, especially to cultivate leadership backbone for agricultural production cooperatives, and to create conditions for the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives in the future, various provinces have formulated relatively detailed plans to train mutual aid and cooperation backbones and cooperative management cadres. It is estimated that over 160,000 people will be trained throughout the region this year. Among them, cooperative management cadres account for about 20,000 people, and the rest are backbone members of existing cooperatives and leaders or activists of mutual aid teams about to establish cooperatives. Currently, some areas have already begun or are in the process of training, while others are making preparations. Some areas, in order to meet the demands of mutual aid teams to transition to cooperatives, have dispatched cadres to help them actively prepare for the transition.

    西北区已有半数以上农户组织起来
    今春以来，西北地区的互助合作组织有很大发展。截至目前，全区组织起来的农户约达三百三十多万户，占农村总户数百分之五十五左右。陕西省组织起来的农户已达总农户百分之五十八点五二，比去年增加百分之十以上，青海省组织起来的比例最高，已达百分之七十一点四二，比去年增加百分之十七以上。各地常年互助组也有所提高和发展。陕西、甘肃、青海三省和西安市郊区参加常年互助组的农户，已占组织起来农户百分之十七强。六月以前，全区已有农业生产合作社一千三百六十一个。农业生产合作社和互助组已显示出比过去更大更多的优越性。陕西关中许多农业生产合作社的小麦产量平均每亩在三、四百斤以上，甚至有五、六百斤以上的；甘肃甘谷县王家庄农业生产合作社平均每亩产量五百七十斤，比去年增加一倍以上。
    为了进一步巩固与提高互助合作组织，特别是培养农业生产合作社的领导骨干，并为今后大量发展农业生产合作社创造条件，各省已作出比较详细的训练互助合作骨干和办社干部计划。全区今年预计共可训练十六万余人。其中办社干部占两万人左右，其余均为现有社的骨干分子和即将建社的互助组的组长或积极分子等。目前，有的地区已经或正在训练，有的正做准备工作，还有一些地区为了满足互助组转社的要求，已抽派干部去帮助他们积极进行转社的准备工作。
