On Criticism, Innovation, and Dogmatism in Science
Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences S. L. Sobolev

Editor's Note: This newspaper published the editorial "Science and Life" from "Communist" on May 28th. Now, we are translating and publishing the article "On Criticism, Innovation, and Dogmatism in Science" from "Pravda" on July 2nd for reference by China's scientific community. This article points out that scientific research should be conducted with a creative spirit, innovation and freedom of criticism should be promoted, dogmatism and formalism should be opposed, and scientific research should be closely linked with the practice of communist construction. At the same time, it also points out that the Soviet scientific community should value and inherit its own scientific heritage, but also respect scientists from various countries who have contributed to the development of world culture and their research results. Regarding this issue, Stepanian's "Lenin on Communist Construction," published in the sixth issue of "Communist" this year, also stated: "Some comrades, due to a misunderstanding of the essence of the struggle against cosmopolitanism, refuse to conduct any research on foreign achievements in natural science and technology. These people have forgotten Lenin's instruction: Communism is now and will be built on the basis of critically transforming all the achievements of world science and technology. ... Lenin demanded that all reactionary elements be discarded from the culture of bourgeois society, while at the same time absorbing, mastering, and creatively transforming all its elements that are beneficial to communism." These are all worthy of deep attention by China's scientific community.

The creative enthusiasm, painstaking research, and spirit of bold thinking of Soviet scientists should all be used to solve scientific problems related to the creative activities carried out by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party.

In the Soviet Union, the Party and the government base their actions on the most advanced science—Marxist-Leninist social science. The role of science in our lives has been elevated to an unprecedented height by the Party. The Communist Party provides all possibilities for our Soviet scientists to work effectively and presents us with great and inspiring tasks in terms of scope and significance.

The Party calls on us to creatively develop science, constantly engage in innovation, in order to maximize all the possibilities we have for communist construction. Every scientific worker should make a certain contribution to communist construction with their research and creation. Wherever a truly creative spirit of exploration dominates, where thought does not stop at achieved results but advances irresistibly, we see new achievements there.

The achievements of Soviet science would be unthinkable without utilizing the rich heritage accumulated by the advanced scientists of our motherland and without creatively comprehending the excellent traditions of our great predecessors. At the same time, Soviet scientists are no longer bound by narrow national limitations. All scientists from all countries who have contributed to the development of world civilization are equally respected by us.

The strength of Soviet science lies in that it starts from its great predecessors, advances, and moves forward forever. The reason why Soviet scientists have been able to achieve great achievements in aviation, radio technology, and atomic physics is because these scientists dare to take unexplored paths and open up new and broadest horizons; they do not take the path of least resistance, that is to say, they are not simply annotators and interpreters of the works of their predecessors.

The Party teaches us to tirelessly create new scientific treasures and make our own contributions to the cause of building a communist society.

However, some of our academic organizations do not understand this well enough. For example, at the "Lomonosov" Moscow State University, although many people claim to be leaders of departments and representatives of scientific opinion, often repeating how faithful they are to the traditions of the great Russian scientists Lebedev, Stoletov, and Umov, for a long time, the achievements in creatively developing modern physics have been very small. Moreover, the problem is that they actually turn a blind eye to new physics. In this case, some of the most important aspects, such as the physics of ultra-high speeds approaching the speed of light, are ignored. This theory of ultra-high speeds was initially sprouted in the works of Lobachevsky and then proposed in the remarkable research of Einstein. It should be known that Einstein's writings attracted great attention from V.I. Lenin. It is perfectly correct for some scientists to criticize Einstein's muddled and idealistic worldview. But they are unwilling and unable to see the rational parts contained in Einstein's specific physical research, and they even vainly try to overthrow the physical content of the theory of relativity. Problems such as completely re-establishing our concepts of the microcosm, of the atomic nucleus and the atomic shell, have not aroused the scientific interest of this group of scholars.

The creative scientific community of the Physics Department of Moscow State University, which has many advanced scientists (including talented young experts), is capable of making great contributions to the most realistic departments of modern physics. But this has not been achieved because the organizational work in the department at that time was not done well, and as a result, a small number of people (including comrades Akulov and Nozdrev) adopted an unprincipled approach to the development of physics, subordinating the development of scientific work to personal and biased views, and covering up all this with meaningless empty talk. The situation created in the department aroused the just accusations of genuine scholars and the Party and Youth League opinion in the department.

V.I. Lenin taught us in his brilliant work "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism" that natural science, like social science, cannot be pre-created in the minds of those "empirio-critics" and "positivists" who believe that only their own feelings are real, but must obtain ever-changing facts from objective nature itself, which exists and develops independently of people.

The most beneficial discoveries and the most principled new achievements are always linked to abandoning prejudices and daring to destroy old norms and old concepts.

We have witnessed the outstanding discoveries of Soviet scientists in astronomy. Not long ago, our scientists proved with a series of irrefutable facts that celestial bodies in the universe are not born simultaneously on a certain day, but are still constantly forming even now. This progress was achieved only because advanced Soviet astronomers were able to abandon any prejudices and abandon dogmatic assumptions about nature in their own laws.

Valuable and profound research in the field of biology has been completed in recent years with the help of radioactive isotopes and "labeled" atoms. Soviet scientists have been able to study the most subtle problems of metabolism and the like using these methods. The achievements in these areas are still due to new, modern methods, new ways of raising questions, and a new attitude towards phenomena.

Our mathematics has made certain achievements. But in mathematics, many aspects that are most closely related to the actual work of communist construction have not yet been fully developed.

For the victory of communism, it is necessary to ensure a huge increase in labor productivity. Communism means the development of new technologies, high speeds, and powerful forces, the realization of great inventions and the utilization of new natural phenomena, and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. All departments of Soviet science must conduct incomparably profound new research work. We should make our scientific research increasingly adapt to the needs of building a communist society. But this should not be understood as narrow pragmatism. The further development of Soviet science will be realized through solving major theoretical problems of principle in science, through new exploration work and new and new inventions.

Efforts to create new and valuable scientific achievements and to move forward non-stop are the characteristics of our era. Innovation in science is inextricably linked to broad creative discussions on the current tasks of science and to comradely creative criticism of the work of scientists. Controversy over different opinions and freedom of criticism—these are the most important conditions for the development of science.

The debates organized by the Party in many knowledge sectors have played a major role in the thriving development of Soviet science. The method of scientific criticism is becoming increasingly popular in all scientific fields.

However, in carrying out scientific criticism, we sometimes encounter the following obstacles. There are still cases here where people treat criticism with an abnormal attitude. Some scholars, for the sake of their own faces, not only ignore criticisms related to their scientific work, but even use various improper methods to circumvent these criticisms.

The deadly enemy of scientific progress is dogmatism, which secretly replaces true scientific inquiry with dogma. This enemy has not yet disappeared from our scientific community.

Some senior scientists believe that they are absolutely correct. They verbally acknowledge the necessity of scientific criticism, but in reality, they try to suppress everything that cannot be accommodated by their formulas. This leads to the kind of bad scientific working methods that we appropriately call militarism. Such scholars try to stifle scientific criticism and do not allow free discussion of problems. Obvious examples are: some articles have been shelved in the editorial departments of some Soviet magazines for a long time because the authors disagree on certain issues with the views established by some scholars (such as Academician T.D. Lysenko, Academician K.M. Bykov, Professor A.G. Ivanov-Smolensky). For this reason alone, such articles and remarks were declared anti-scientific. If this tendency is tolerated, then any truly new ideas cannot exist and develop.

Some scholars often make criticism itself take on a completely distorted dogmatic form. They treat some opinions and works by arguing how reliable they are, while they treat others by hastily drawing conclusions, sometimes even starting from personal motives, and putting a uniform label on them: "reactionary," "idealistic," and so on. Some of our biologists often use such radical words lacking scientific basis: "remnants of Weismannism," "revenge-seekers," "Malthusians." There are also such people among physiologists who call any criticism of them "anti-Pavlovian" and "revenge-seeking." Needless to say, Soviet scientists will continue to conduct thorough and resolute struggles against various pseudoscientific, idealistic, and reactionary manifestations in the future. In this case, the weapon of criticism must be directed at the true manifestations of that heresy. However, using such "radical" words very rashly and without basis will only bring us harm.

The Party teaches us that criticism should be principled and should be of the greatest benefit to the cause. Do not randomly label your opponents, do not strike fatal blows with slanderous arguments, but should reveal the essence of the dispute as deeply as possible in a comradely manner. The purpose of correct and constructive scientific criticism is to clarify the path for the further development of a certain scientific department, which problems have not been fully clarified and need to be further studied, and what methods should be adopted for research.

Individual scholars have the tendency to only divide any opinions or works into "black" or "white" when reviewing them, without distinguishing between their positive or negative factors. This is a serious shortcoming in scientific work.

When we carry out scientific criticism, we must examine all aspects of scientific achievements or principles, and evaluate different factors differently: find the truly valuable core, develop the positive aspects, and discard the useless and incorrect parts.

Let us take the theory of grassland farming system of our outstanding scientist V. R. Williams as an example. Under specific conditions, the progressive significance of this theory is undeniable, but it is not a panacea for the smooth development of agriculture under all conditions and in all regions. As the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the CPC Central Committee pointed out, due to the dogmatic application of this theory to the arid regions of southern China, the national economy suffered serious losses: the sown area of perennial pasture with very low yields in these regions was unjustifiably expanded, while the sown area of grain crops was equally unjustifiably reduced. From this example, we can see how great a loss to the interests of the country can be caused by dogmatism in science that quietly climbs from the laboratory to the stage of life. Our Party Central Committee uses this example to educate Soviet scholars, telling them how they should resolutely and bravely expose dogmatism and conservative habits in science, and make science drastically turn to the actual needs of communist construction.

In scientific debates, we often encounter opponents who, in order to defend themselves, vainly use the opinions of authoritative figures in the scientific community, use a large number of quotes, without independently revealing the essence of the problem, and do not want to give this problem a new solution in accordance with the new situation and the accumulated new experience.

What is most important to us is not whether it conforms to certain creeds, but to test ideas and theories with practice and life, and to boldly develop theories based on scientific summaries of the results of practice. The cult of personality is incompatible with Soviet scientists, because everyone knows that the best scholars are always the products of their own time, and not all of their views will forever maintain their scientific significance.

Our country has a long-trained, experienced and knowledgeable old generation of scientific cadres with great creative ability, and is constantly supplemented by young people who are active, brave, and seek new paths. The combination of the two is a guarantee for the further achievements of Soviet scientific thought and for our science to be more actively involved in communist construction in the near future.

    论科学中的批评、革新精神和教条主义
    苏联科学院院士  斯·列·索波列夫
    编者按：本报在今年五月二十八日曾译载过“共产党人”的社论“科学和生活”，现在再把今年七月二日“真理报”上的一篇论文“论科学中的批评、革新精神和教条主义”译出来发表，以供我国科学界参考。这篇论文指出，要以创造性的精神研究科学，要提倡革新精神和批评自由，要反对教条主义和公式化，要把科学研究和共产主义建设的实践密切地联系起来；同时它还指出：苏联科学界要重视和继承本国的科学遗产，但同样也要尊重各国对世界文化发展有贡献的科学家及其研究成果。关于这个问题，“共产党人”今年第六期所刊载的斯捷潘年的“列宁论共产主义建设”一文中也说过：“某些同志由于错误地理解了反对世界主义斗争的实质，因而拒绝对外国自然科学和技术方面的成就进行任何研究。这些人忘记了列宁的指示：共产主义现在是，而且将来也是建立在批判地改造世界科学与技术的一切成就的基础上。……列宁要求从资产阶级社会的文化中摈弃一切反动的成分，而同时要吸收、掌握并创造性地改造其一切有利于共产主义的成分。”这些都值得我国科学界加以深切的注意。
    苏联科学家的创造热情、苦心钻研和勇于思考的精神，都应当用来解决与苏联人民在共产党领导下进行的创造性活动有关的科学问题。
    在苏联，党和政府以最先进的科学——马克思列宁主义社会科学为自己行动的依据。科学在我国生活中的作用被党提到了前所未有的高度。共产党为我们苏联科学家卓有成效地进行工作提供了一切可能性，并向我们提出了无论就其范围和意义说来都是伟大的、令人鼓舞的任务。
    党号召我们创造性地发展科学，不断地从事革新，以便最大限度地把我们拥有的一切可能性运用于共产主义建设。每个科学工作者都应当以自己的研究创造，为共产主义建设作出一定的贡献。凡是真正创造性的钻研精神占居统治地位，思想不是停留于业已达到的成绩、而是不可遏止地勇往直前的地方，我们就在那里看到新的成就。
    如果不利用我们祖国先进的科学家积累下来的丰富遗产，如果不创造性地领会我们的伟大先驱者的优秀传统，苏联科学的成就将是不能设想的。同时，苏联科学家已经不受狭隘的民族局限性的束缚。世界各国所有对世界文明的发展有贡献的科学家，都同样受到我们的尊重。
    苏联科学的强大力量在于：它从自己的伟大前辈那里出发，前进，永远前进。苏联科学家所以能够在航空、无线电技术、原子物理学方面取得巨大的成就，就是因为这些科学家敢于走未经开拓的道路，并打开新的、最广阔的眼界；他们不走最省力的道路，这就是说，他们不单纯是他们前辈的著作的注释者和阐述者。
    党教导我们不倦地创造新的科学瑰宝，为创立共产主义社会的事业作出自己的贡献。
    但是，我们的个别学术团体对这一点还不够了解。例如在国立莫斯科“罗蒙诺索夫”大学，尽管有许多人以学系的领导者和科学舆论的代表者自居，经常重复着自己对伟大的俄国科学家列别杰夫、斯托列托夫、乌莫夫的传统如何忠实，可是在长时期中，在创造性地发展现代物理学方面，成绩还是很小。而且问题是，他们实际上对新的物理学熟视无睹。在这种情况下，像接近光速的超高速物理学这样一些最重要的方面就被忽视了。这种超高速理论是在罗巴契夫斯基的著作中最初萌芽、继而在爱因斯坦的卓越研究中提出来的。要知道，爱因斯坦的著作曾引起弗·依·列宁的极大注意。有些科学家批评爱因斯坦的糊涂的、唯心主义的世界观，这是十分正确的。可是他们却不愿意也不能够看见那些包含在爱因斯坦的具体的物理研究中的合理部分，他们甚至徒然想要推翻相对论中的物理的内容。像完全重新树立我们对于微观世界的概念、对于原子核和原子外壳的概念这一类问题，也没有引起这批学者的科学兴趣。
    拥有不少先进的科学家（包括天才的青年专家）的国立莫斯科大学物理系的富有创造力的全体科学工作者，是能够对现代物理学中最现实的部门作出巨大贡献的。但是这一点没有做到，这是由于当时系内组织工作做得不好，结果有一小部分人
  （包括阿库洛夫、诺兹德列夫等同志）对物理学的发展问题采取了无原则的方针，使科学工作的发展从属于个人的、偏颇的见解，并用无谓的空谈来掩饰这一切。系内所造成的情况，引起了真正的学者以及系内党和青年团舆论的公正指责。
    弗·依·列宁在其天才著作“唯物论与经验批判论”一书中教导我们，自然科学也像社会科学一样，不可能在那些认为只有自己的感觉是现实的
  “经验批判论者”和“实证论者”的头脑中预先创造出来，而必须从离开人们独立存在和发展的客观自然本身获取日新月异的事实。
    最有益的发现，最有原则意义的新成果，总是和抛弃成见，和勇于摧毁旧规范与旧概念联系着的。
    我们亲眼看到了苏联科学家在天文学方面的卓越发现。不久以前，我们的科学家以一系列无可争辩的事实证明，宇宙中的星体不是在某一天同时诞生，而是直到现在还在不断地形成着的。这一进展的取得只是由于先进的苏联天文学家能够抛弃任何成见，抛弃自己的定律中对自然界所作的教条主义的假想。
    生物学领域内的有价值的深刻的研究，最近几年借助于放射性同位素和“标记”原子而得以完成。苏联科学家用这些方法，能够对新陈代谢中最为微妙的问题以及诸如此类的问题进行研究。这些方面之能够取得成就，仍然要归功于新的、现代化的方法，对问题的新的提法，对现象的新的态度。
    我们的数学有一定的成绩。但是在数学中，与共产主义实际建设工作关系最为密切的许多方面，还远没有得到充分的发展。
    为了共产主义的胜利，必须保证劳动生产率的巨大增长。共产主义就意味着新技术、高速度、强大威力的发展，意味着伟大发明的实现和新自然现象的利用，意味着原子能用于和平的目的。苏联科学的一切部门必须进行无比深刻的新的研究工作。我们应当使我们的科学研究愈益适应建设共产主义社会的需要。但是不应把这一点理解为狭隘的实用主义。苏联科学的进一步发展，要通过解决科学中带原则性的重大理论问题，通过新的探索工作和新而又新的发明来实现。
    努力创造日新月异的可珍贵的科学成果，时刻不停地向前迈进，这是我们时代的特征。科学方面的革新，是与对科学的当前任务的广泛的创造性的讨论，与对科学家工作的同志般的创造性的批评不可分割地联系着的。不同意见的争论和批评的自由，——这是科学发展的最重要的条件。
    党所组织的许多知识部门的辩论，在苏联科学的蒸蒸日上的发展中起了重大的作用。科学批评的方法在一切科学领域内日益深入人心了。
    但是，在开展科学的批评中有时遇到下述的一些障碍。我们这里还有以不正常的态度对待批评的情况。有些学者为了自己的面子，不仅对有关他们的科学工作的批评置之不理，甚至还用各种不正当的方法来规避这些批评。
    科学进步的死敌是教条主义，是以教条暗中替换真正的科学探讨。这个敌人在我们科学界至今尚未绝迹。
    某些年高望重的科学家，认为自己是绝对正确的，他们口头上承认科学批评的必要性，而实际上却力图压制为他们的公式所不能容纳的一切。由此也就产生了那种我们恰当地称为军阀主义的恶劣的科学工作方法，这样一些学者力图箝制科学批评，不容许对问题的自由讨论。明显的例子是：有一些文章被长期搁置在苏联某些杂志的编辑部里，因为文章的作者在若干问题上不同意某些学者（如特·德·李森科院士，克·马·贝科夫院士，阿·格·伊凡诺夫—斯莫林斯基教授）所确立的观点。仅仅为了这个缘故，这样一些文章和言论竟被宣布为反科学的。这种倾向如被纵容下去，那么，任何真正的新思想都是不可能存在和发展的。
    有些学者常常使批评本身也带有完全歪曲的教条主义形式。他们对待有一些意见和著作，是论证它如何可靠；而对待另一些，则是根据仓卒得出的结论，有时还从个人动机出发，给它扣上一个千篇一律的帽子：“反动的”、“唯心主义的”等等。我们有些生物学家，常常缺乏科学根据地滥用这样一些激烈的字眼：“残存的魏斯曼主义者”、“报复分子”、“马尔萨斯派”。在生理学家里面还有这样的人，他们把对他们的任何批评都称作“反巴甫洛夫的”、“报复主义的”。不待说，苏联的科学家今后也还要与各色各样伪科学的、唯心主义的、反动的表现进行彻底而坚决的斗争。在这种情况下，批评武器必须针对着那种异端思想的真正表现。但是，非常轻率地和毫无根据地运用那样一些
  “激烈的”字眼，却只会给我们带来损害。
    党教导我们，批评要有原则性，要使它对事业有最大的裨益。不可以给自己的反对者乱扣帽子，不要以诬蔑性的论断予人以致命的打击，而应当用同志的态度尽量深入地揭露争端的本质。正确的建设性的科学批评的目的是：弄清楚某一科学部门进
  一步发展的道路何在，哪些问题尚未充分阐明，有待继续研究，以及采取什么方法研究。
    个别学者有这样的倾向，他们审查任何意见或著作时，只是把它们分成“黑的”或“白的”，而不区别它们之中的积极的或消极的因素。这是科学工作中的严重缺点。
    我们在开展科学的批评时，必须考察科学的成果或原理的各个方面，对不同的因素作不同的估价：找出真正有价值的核心，发展积极的一面，抛弃无用的、不正确的部分。
    兹举我们的卓越的科学家维·勒·威廉姆士关于草田农作制的学说为例。在特定的条件下，这个学说的进步意义是无可争辩的，但它却不是在一切条件和一切地区顺利发展农业的万应良药。正如苏共中央二—三月全会所指出的，由于墨守成规地将这个学说运用于我国南部干旱地区，国民经济遭到了严重的损失：在这些地区收成很低的多年生牧草的播种面积毫无根据地扩大了，而谷类作物的播种面积同样毫无根据地缩小了。从这件事例中我们可以看到，由研究室悄悄爬到生活舞台上来的科学中的教条主义，能使国家的利益遭受多么大的损失。我党中央用这个例子来教育苏联的学者，告诉他们应当如何坚决勇敢地揭露科学中的教条主义和因循守旧的习气，并使科学急遽转向共产主义建设的实际需要方面去。
    在科学的辩论中常常遇到这样的对手，他们为了给自己辩护，徒然搬用科学界权威人士的意见，搬用一大堆引语，而不去独立地揭露问题的实质，不想按照新情况和聚积的新经验予这一问题以新的解决。
    对我们最关重要的不是符合或不符合一定的信条，重要的是用实际和生活来检验思想和理论，根据对实践的成果所作的科学的总结来大胆地发展理论。个人崇拜是与苏联科学家格格不入的，因为大家知道，最优秀的学者总是他自己当代的产儿，他们的观点绝非全部都会永远保持其科学的意义的。
    我国拥有久经锻炼的、经验丰富和学识渊博的、具有广大的创造能力的老一代的科学干部，并不断地补充着积极、勇敢、寻求新道路的青年。两者的结合，是苏联科学思想取得进一步成就的保证，是我们的科学在最近期间更积极地投入共产主义建设的保证。
