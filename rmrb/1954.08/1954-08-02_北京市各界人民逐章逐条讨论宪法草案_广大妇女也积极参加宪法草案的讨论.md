    People from All Walks of Life in Beijing Discuss the Draft Constitution Chapter by Chapter and Article by Article
    Broad Masses of Women also Actively Participate in the Discussion of the Draft Constitution
    People from all walks of life in Beijing are now conscientiously discussing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China chapter by chapter and article by article, and actively putting forward opinions for revision and supplementation.
    Since the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, a nationwide discussion has been launched in Beijing. At present, on the basis of a preliminary understanding of the spirit and content of the Draft Constitution in the previous stage, the broad masses of people have begun a discussion article by article. More than 100,000 cadres in the city have completed the discussion of the "Preamble" and "General Principles" sections, and are about to discuss the "State Organs" section. Employees of many state-owned and private enterprises, such as Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant, Beijing People's Printing Factory, Qinghe Woolen Mill, and privately owned Lianchang Electric Motor Factory, as well as street residents, began article-by-article discussions in late July through reading groups. Article-by-article discussions have also generally begun in various systems such as universities, industry and commerce, ethnic minorities, religious circles, democratic parties, and literary and art circles. During the discussion, the branch committees of the Draft Constitution Discussion Committee in various systems and districts, and the leading cadres of various units, actively led and assisted in this discussion. The Dongsi and Xidan districts trained a large number of key members to lead newspaper reading group discussions, with more than 3,000 active members among workers in state-owned factories and enterprises and residents in Dongsi district alone. In order to encourage employees to put forward revision opinions, the Flour Mill No. 4 of the Beijing Food Industry Company invited the factory director to introduce the situation of the Soviet people's discussion of the Soviet Draft Constitution in 1936 before the article-by-article discussion, and assigned cadres from various sections and offices to the discussion groups as recorders. Draft Constitution opinion boxes to facilitate the public to put forward opinions have been set up in important streets and alleys throughout the city. Near the opinion boxes in various streets in Dongsi District, newspapers containing the Draft Constitution and big-character posters calling on people from all walks of life to put forward revision opinions were also posted.
    In the units that have started article-by-article discussions, the participants are treating the glorious task of formulating the fundamental law of the country with a serious and cautious attitude as masters of the country. Colorfully decorated big-character slogans with the words "Actively discuss the Draft Constitution, actively provide revision opinions" were posted in the Beijing Clothing Factory. The employees of this factory, who are undergoing article-by-article discussions, gathered in groups of three or five in the shade of trees or in dormitories during lunch breaks to carefully read the Draft Constitution and prepare to put forward revision opinions at the group meetings. The employees of Shijingshan Power Plant formed 45 discussion groups, and the vast majority of employees in the plant participated in the discussion. People from all walks of life have now put forward many opinions on revising and supplementing the Draft Constitution. The employees of Qinghe Woolen Mill started discussions on the 26th and put forward 63 opinions in two days. Seventy-four workers from Flour Mill No. 4 of the Beijing Food Industry Company who participated in the article-by-article discussions put forward 173 opinions for revision and supplementation during the discussions. The Qianmen District Branch of the Draft Constitution Discussion Committee has received more than 1,000 opinions from people from all walks of life.
    The high degree of political consciousness of the workers and masses can be seen in the many opinions for revision and supplementation they have put forward. When discussing Article 20 of the General Principles, Liu Chunzhi, a member of the Communist Youth League and a technician at Flour Mill No. 4 of the Beijing Food Industry Company, suggested adding "airspace" and "territorial waters" below "territory," saying: "In the past, imperialists not only attacked us from land, but also invaded us from the sky and sea; today, our people's armed forces must defend our territory, territorial waters, and airspace and never let the imperialists invade!" The employees also pondered over the wording of the Draft Constitution sentence by sentence and word by word. Liu Fenglin, a technician from the overhaul workshop of the Beijing Tram Company, pointed out that the phrases "the masses of the people" and "masses" in Article 17 of the Draft Constitution are inconsistent and should be changed to "the people" or "the masses of the people." The Beijing Draft Constitution Discussion Committee has now compiled various opinions into volumes and submitted them to the Draft Constitution Drafting Committee of the People's Republic of China for reference.

    The broad masses of women in the capital are actively participating in the discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. At present, more than 90 percent of female workers, family members of employees, and most housewives in the streets throughout the city have heard the report on the Draft Constitution, and some have even participated in the discussion. At the report meetings for street residents, there were white-haired old ladies and young mothers holding their children. Many female students attending night school also took notes carefully when listening to the reports. More than 98 percent of the female workers in Qinghe Woolen Mill and People's Printing Factory participated in the discussion of the Draft Constitution. Many female workers carefully read the "China Youth" magazine containing the full text of the Draft Constitution after work, and talked about it in groups of two and three. Many young female members of the Nanyuan Shiliuzhuang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative bought single copies of the Draft Constitution. Yang Qingrong, a housewife from Banbi Street in Xisi District who is illiterate, also bought a copy of the Draft Constitution and asked her children to read it to her.
    After publicity and discussion, women from all walks of life have deeply realized the close relationship between the Draft Constitution and everyone's personal interests. They are particularly excited about the provisions concerning women's rights in the Draft Constitution. In recent years, women in Beijing have deeply felt the care of the People's Government and enjoyed various rights. As a result of this year's grass-roots elections, women account for 24.2 percent of the representatives to the People's Congresses in various districts. Women account for 106 of the 564 representatives to the Municipal People's Congress. Many women also hold positions such as district head, director of public security sub-bureau, and president of the district people's court. There are now about 60,000 female workers in Beijing, and many of them have been named model workers and advanced workers. In recent years, more than 13,000 women have participated in street work. At the same time, with the development of economic construction, the welfare undertakings for women and children have also developed day by day. There are currently 435 various childcare institutions such as nurseries, daycare centers, and creches throughout the city, caring for more than 20,300 children. The number of maternal and child health stations has also increased by four compared with last year, and the equipment is more complete than before.
    During the discussions, women repeatedly mentioned these facts and compared their life experiences before and after liberation. Everyone's painful and bitter life experiences were very moving to hear. Zhao Lingdi, a weaving worker at the Beijing Machine Weaving and Dyeing Factory, was sent to a brothel when she was very young in the old society; after liberation, the people rescued her from the abyss, helped her to treat her illness, and introduced her to work. Last year, she was named a model worker in the factory. She said very excitedly: The wishes of our sisters for many years have been stipulated in the Draft Constitution. Mother Hu, a family member committee member of the Beijing Tram Company, said excitedly: "I want to raise both hands to support the Draft Constitution!" The experiences of this old woman before liberation were also very tragic. Now her three children are all employed. Her daughter, Hu Kuiying, created a fast ticketing method in her work as a conductor in the tram company and was elected as a district people's representative in the general election. She herself was also elected as a model family member. Many female medical workers and staff members of nurseries and maternal and child health stations were moved by the country's care for women and children during the discussion of the Draft Constitution, and they all expressed their determination to do their job more diligently.
    Recalling the past and comparing it with the present, the broad masses of women in Beijing have increased their love for the new society, and they have expressed their determination to support the Draft Constitution with practical actions. Gao Shuxian, a model worker in Beijing and a female worker at Qinghe Woolen Mill who has just returned from a recuperation in Qingdao, is leading the group to formulate a plan to increase production and save more than 600 million yuan throughout the year. After hearing the report on the Draft Constitution, the female members of the Nanyuan Shiliuzhuang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative became even more enthusiastic about production.

    北京市各界人民逐章逐条讨论宪法草案
    广大妇女也积极参加宪法草案的讨论
    北京市各界人民现在正对中华人民共和国宪法草案认真进行逐章逐条的讨论，并积极提出修改、补充意见。
    宪法草案公布以来，在北京市已展开了全民讨论。目前广大人民群众在前一阶段对宪法草案的精神和内容有了初步了解的基础上，又开始了逐条的讨论。全市十万多名干部已讨论完“序言”“总纲”部分，即将讨论“国家机构”部分。石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂、北京人民印刷厂、清河制呢厂、私营联昌电机厂等许多国营、私营企业的职工以及街道居民，已在七月下旬通过读报组先后开始逐条讨论。各高等学校、工商界、少数民族、宗教界、各民主党派、文艺界等各系统的逐条讨论也已普遍开始。在讨论中，各系统、各区的宪法草案讨论委员会分会和各单位的领导干部都积极地领导和帮助这次讨论。东四区和西单区训练了大批领导读报小组讨论的骨干，仅东四区训练的国营工厂企业职工和街道居民中的积极分子就有三千多人。北京市食品工业公司面粉四厂为了启发职工提出修改意见，在逐条讨论前，由厂长介绍了苏联人民一九三六年讨论苏联宪法草案的情况，并抽调各科、室干部到讨论小组去作记录员。便利群众提出意见的宪法草案意见箱已在全市各重要街道、胡同中设立起来。东四区各街道的意见箱附近还贴着刊有宪法草案的报纸和号召各界人民提出修改意见的大字报。
    在已经开始逐条讨论的各单位，参加讨论的人员都严肃而又慎重地以主人翁的态度来对待制定国家根本大法的光荣任务。北京市被服厂里贴起了“积极讨论宪法草案，积极提供修改意见”的彩色大字标语，这个厂正在进行逐条讨论的职工，在中午休息时三五成群地聚集在树荫下或宿舍里，认真阅读宪法草案，准备在小组会上提出修改意见。石景山发电厂的职工组成了四十五个讨论小组，全厂职工绝大多数都参加了讨论。现在各界人民已提出了很多对宪法草案的修改和补充意见。清河制呢厂职工二十六日开始讨论，两天内提出意见六十三条。北京市食品工业公司面粉四厂参加逐条讨论的七十四个工人在讨论中提出修改和补充意见一百七十三条。前门区宪法草案讨论委员会分会已收到各界人民提出的意见一千多条。
    在职工群众提出的许多修改和补充意见中，可以看出他们的高度的政治觉悟。北京市食品工业公司面粉四厂技术工人在讨论总纲第二十条时，青年团员刘春芝建议在“领土”下面加上“领空”“领海”，他说：“过去帝国主义者除了从陆地进攻我们外，还从天上、海上来侵略我们；今天我们人民的武装力量一定要把领土、领海和领空保卫好，绝不让帝国主义来侵犯！”职工们对宪法草案的文字也逐句逐字地琢磨。北京市电车公司检修车间的技术工人刘凤林提出：宪法草案第十七条中“人民群众”和“群众”字样前后不一致，不如一律改为
  “人民”或“人民群众”。现在北京市宪法草案讨论委员会已陆续将各种意见汇集成册，送交中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会作为参考。（新华社）
    首都广大妇女积极参加中华人民共和国宪法草案的讨论。现在全市百分之九十以上的女工、职工家属以及大部分街道的家庭妇女都听了宪法草案的报告，有的人并且参加了讨论。在街道居民的报告会上，有白发苍苍的老太太，也有抱着孩子的年轻母亲，很多参加夜校的女学员在听报告时还认真地做了笔记。清河制呢厂、人民印刷厂参加宪法草案讨论的女工达百分之九十八以上。很多女工在下班后都拿着刊有宪法草案全文的“中国青年”杂志精心地阅读，三三两两地交谈着。南苑石榴庄乡农业生产合作社里的很多青年女社员都买了宪法草案单行本。西四区半壁街家庭妇女杨庆荣是个文盲，也买了一本宪法草案叫孩子念给她听。
    经过宣传讨论，各阶层妇女都深刻体会到宪法草案和每一个人的切身关系。她们对宪法草案上有关妇女权利的规定特别感到兴奋。几年来，北京市的妇女已深深感受到人民政府的关怀，并享受着各种权利。今年基层选举的结果，各区人民代表大会代表中，妇女就占百分之二十四·二，五百六十四名市人民代表大会的代表中，妇女即占一百零六名。还有不少妇女担任了区长、公安分局局长、区人民法院院长等职务。现在北京市的女工约有六万多人，其中不少女工被评为劳动模范和先进工作者。几年来妇女参加街道工作的有一万三千多人。同时随着经济建设的发展，妇女、儿童的福利事业也日益发展，全市现有托儿所、托儿站、乳儿室等各种托儿机构四百三十五处，受托儿童有两万零三百多名。妇幼保健站也比去年增加了四处，设备也较前完善了。
    妇女们在讨论中，一再提到这些事实，并把解放前后自己生活的经历作了对比。她们每一个人的苦痛而辛酸的身世使人听起来都十分感动。北京市机织印染厂织布工人赵领弟在旧社会当她年龄很小的时候就被送到妓院；解放后，人民从火坑中救出了她，帮她治病，又介绍她参加了工作，去年她被评为厂里的劳动模范。她非常激动地说：我们姊妹们多少年来的愿望在宪法草案里都规定了。北京市电车公司家属委员胡老太太兴奋地说：“我要举起双手来拥护宪法草案！”这位老人解放前的遭遇也是很悲惨的，现在她的三个孩子都参加了工作，女儿胡奎英在担任电车公司的售票员工作中创造了快速售票法，在普选中被选为区人民代表。她自己也被选为家属模范。许多女医务工作人员和托儿所、妇幼保健站的工作人员，在讨论宪法草案时，为国家对妇女、儿童的关怀所感动，她们都表示要更努力地做好自己的工作。
    回忆过去，对比现在，北京市的广大妇女更增加了对新社会的热爱，她们纷纷表示要以实际行动拥护宪法草案。刚从青岛休养回来的北京市劳动模范、清河制呢厂女工高淑贤，正在带动小组制订全年增产节约六亿多元的计划。南苑石榴庄乡农业生产合作社的女社员听了宪法草案报告以后，生产也更加起劲了。　（新华社）
