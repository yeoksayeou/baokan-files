    Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: After receiving support and encouragement during his talks with Eisenhower, the Syngman Rhee clique is creating an atmosphere according to its planned sabotage program, attempting to undermine the provisions of the armistice agreement concerning the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

    On the same day that the talks between Eisenhower and Syngman Rhee concluded on July 30, Won Yong-deok, the South Korean special agent chief who forcibly abducted 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war under the guise of "release" before the signing of the armistice agreement, issued a statement openly claiming that after the conclusion of the Geneva Conference negotiations on the Korean issue, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission had "lost its authority." He also arrogantly threatened the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Czechoslovak and Polish representatives in its Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to "immediately withdraw" from South Korea, or "necessary actions" would be taken against them. The South Korean Ambassador to Washington, Liang Youchan, also tried his best on the same day to slander the Czechoslovak and Polish representatives, threatening to "expel" them from South Korea. On July 31, Syngman Rhee even more arrogantly issued a statement when leaving Washington for New York, publicly declaring that after the Geneva Conference negotiations on the Korean issue, "the terms of the armistice agreement have immediately and automatically lost their effectiveness," and he greatly slandered the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, arrogantly demanding that the United States agree to "expel them." Syngman Rhee also publicly supported Won Yong-deok's provocative actions. He stated that Won Yong-deok's "actions against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission were correct" and "should have been taken long ago." On the same day, the Syngman Rhee clique also dispatched a group of special agent thugs in Incheon to "demonstrate" outside the residences of personnel from the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed in Incheon, and they frantically attempted to break into the residences to threaten and intimidate the neutral nations personnel. It is very clear that the Syngman Rhee clique, under the direction of the United States, is engaging in such lawless provocative actions that violate the armistice agreement and international norms in an attempt to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which has played a positive role in ensuring the implementation of the armistice agreement. This would allow them to import large quantities of military equipment and military supplies from outside Korea without restraint, accelerate the expansion and strengthening of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, and serve the policies of its American masters in creating tension in Asia and launching military adventures.

    The reason why the Syngman Rhee clique is increasingly blatantly threatening to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is obviously because it has received the support and encouragement of the U.S. authorities, who are intent on creating tension and seeking military gambles. After Eisenhower asked Syngman Rhee to go to Washington to discuss the so-called "unification" of Korea, the Syngman Rhee clique became even more rampant in issuing threats to "abolish" the armistice agreement, re-launch the war of aggression, and accelerate the expansion of the Syngman Rhee puppet army and carry out war preparations. Syngman Rhee also formulated a huge plan for expanding armaments and preparing for war, which he brought to Washington to ask his American masters to approve. According to Western news agencies, the first step in Syngman Rhee's criminal plan is to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which greatly hinders Syngman Rhee's arms expansion and war preparations. After arriving in Washington and holding talks with Eisenhower, Syngman Rhee issued provocative war cries for days. The hostile and insane degree of these cries fully exposed the conspiracy planned by the U.S.-Rhee talks. According to Western news agencies and newspapers, the U.S. authorities have agreed in the talks to provide Syngman Rhee with a large number of jet aircraft, ships and other new military equipment, increase "aid" to South Korea from more than 800 million U.S. dollars per year to more than 1 billion U.S. dollars per year, and expand the U.S. plan to train the Syngman Rhee puppet army. Therefore, when Syngman Rhee left Washington for New York on July 31, he expressed "extreme satisfaction" with the strong support of his American masters. Precisely because of this, on the same day that the talks with Eisenhower ended, the Syngman Rhee clique could not wait to implement its predetermined plan and began to attack the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. This action by the United States in directing Syngman Rhee shows that the United States is naturally unwilling to accept defeat after its obstruction in Geneva and is determined to further use Syngman Rhee to deepen the instability of the Korean armistice and increase the threat to the security of China and North Korea.

    The U.S. authorities have an inescapable responsibility to ensure the implementation of all the terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement. He has the full responsibility to guarantee the convenience of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in carrying out its legitimate duties and to protect the safety of its personnel. The establishment of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is an extremely important component of the armistice agreement. No one is allowed to undermine it. The armistice agreement stipulates that the two sides of the armistice shall grant the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its Neutral Nations Inspection Teams the freedom and convenience necessary to perform their duties and shall provide full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation. Before the signing of the armistice agreement, Harrison, the chief representative of the U.S. Armistice Negotiation Delegation, also repeatedly stated at the plenary session of the two delegations that the neutral nations personnel going to work in South Korea would be protected and given convenience in their work. Therefore, the U.S. authorities must bear the inescapable serious responsibility for the consequences of this extremely dangerous provocative action by the Syngman Rhee clique.

    美国指使李承晚集团破坏中立国监察委员会
    【新华社二日讯】李承晚集团在和艾森豪威尔举行的会谈中得到了支持和鼓励以后，正在按照它预定的破坏计划，制造气氛，企图破坏停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的条款。
    在七月三十日艾森豪威尔和李承晚之间的会谈结束的同一天，曾在停战协定签订之前以“释放”为名用武力劫走二万七千名朝中战俘的南朝鲜特务头子元容德发表了一项声明，公然声称在日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判结束以后，中立国监察委员会已经“失去了它的职权”，并狂妄威胁中立国监察委员会以及它的中立国视察小组中的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表要“立即撤出”南朝鲜，否则就要对他们采取“必需的行动”。南朝鲜驻华盛顿的大使梁祐灿也在同一天竭力诬蔑捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表，威胁要把他们“驱逐出”南朝鲜。七月三十一日李承晚在离华盛顿去纽约时更嚣张地发表声明，公开宣称在日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判举行以后，“停战协定的条款已经立即自然而然地失去效力”，并且大肆诽谤中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员，狂妄要求美国同意把他们“驱逐出去”。李承晚还公开支持元容德的挑衅性行动。他表示，元容德“对中立国监察委员会采取的行动是对的”，而且“早就应当采取这种行动”。在同一天，李承晚集团还在仁川派遣了一批特务暴徒在驻仁川的中立国视察小组的人员的住所外面进行
  “示威”，并且猖狂地企图冲入住所，对中立国人员进行威胁和恫吓。十分明显，李承晚集团受美国指使进行的这种违反停战协定和国际常规的无法无天的挑衅性行动，就是企图取消对保证停战协定的实施起了积极作用的中立国监察委员会，以便无所顾忌地从朝鲜境外运入大批军事装备和军事物资，加紧进行扩充和加强李承晚傀儡军队，为它的美国主子在亚洲制造紧张局势和发动军事冒险的政策服务。
      李承晚集团所以越来越猖獗地公开威胁破坏中立国监察委员会，显然是由于它得到了一心制造紧张局势、寻找军事赌博的美国当局的支持和鼓励的结果。在艾森豪威尔要李承晚到华盛顿去，讨论所谓“统一”朝鲜的问题以后，李承晚集团就更加猖狂地发出威胁要“废止”停战协定，重新发动侵略战争，并且加紧扩充李承晚伪军，进行战争准备。李承晚还制定了一个庞大的扩军备战的计划，带到华盛顿去要求它的美国主子批准。据西方通讯社报道，李承晚这个罪恶计划的第一个步骤就是要破坏对李承晚扩军备战十分碍事的中立国监察委员会。李承晚在到达华盛顿和艾森豪威尔举行会谈以后，更连日发出挑衅性的战争叫嚣。这种叫嚣的敌视和平的疯狂程度，充分暴露了美李会谈所策划的阴谋。据西方通讯社和报纸透露，美国当局在会谈中已同意给予李承晚大量喷气式飞机、舰艇和其他新式的军事装备，对南朝鲜的“援助”从每年八亿美元以上增加到每年十亿美元以上，扩大美国训练李承晚伪军的计划。所以，李承晚在七月三十一日离华盛顿去纽约时，还对它美国主子的大力支持表示“极为满意”。正因为如此，李承晚集团在和艾森豪威尔会谈结束的同一天，就迫不及待地实行它预定的计划，开始对中立国监察委员会进行攻击了。美国指使李承晚进行的这种行动表明，美国在它在内瓦会议上阻挠失败以后，自然死不甘心，决心进一步利用李承晚来加深朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，并增加对朝中两国的安全的威胁。
    美国当局有保证实施朝鲜停战协定全部条款的无可逃避的责任。他有完全的责任保证中立国监察委员会执行合法职司的便利，并保护人身的安全。中立国监察委员会的设置是停战协定中的一个极端重要的组成部分。不容许任何人把它破坏。停战协定规定，停战双方应给予中立国监察委员会以及它的中立国视察小组执行其职司所必需的自由与便利，并且给予充分的保护及一切可能的协助与合作。美方停战谈判代表团的首席代表哈利逊在停战协定签订以前，也曾在双方代表团大会上一再表示，前往南朝鲜工作的中立国人员将被保护和给予他们工作上的便利。因此，美国当局对李承晚集团进行的这种十分危险的挑衅性行动所发生的后果，必须承担无可逃避的严重责任。
