　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 12th: Indonesian Deputy Speaker of Parliament Arudji Kartawinata said on the 8th that the United States is increasingly trying to impose its policies on Asian countries. He said that the United States is trying hard to drag Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Burma, and Ceylon into the US sphere of influence under the guise of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

　　Arudji Kartawinata said that US policy would not only disrupt constructive efforts to stabilize Asian peace but also undermine the peaceful policies implemented in the spirit of consultation in the Geneva negotiations. He said that the United States is attempting to sow discord among the Colombo countries and undermine the Asian-African conference through shady means. He hopes that Asian countries will bravely take firm steps to stop any actions that interfere in their internal affairs.

　　Arudji Kartawinata believes that the United States has exerted pressure, threats, or direct damage to Indonesian interests in the negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands on federal issues.

　　Rendono, chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, once again expressed his opinion on the US's Southeast Asia Treaty Organization plan on the 9th. He said that although Dulles advocated changing the name of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, this would not change the purpose of this military alliance. Rendono said that although it is said that this proposed military alliance will be based on providing economic assistance to backward countries, its actual purpose is to deal with imaginary enemies.

　　印尼国会人士反对美国拼凑东南亚集团
    【新华社雅加达十二日电】印度尼西亚国会副议长阿鲁齐·卡塔韦纳塔八日说，美国越来越想把它的政策强加于亚洲国家的身上。他说，美国正在竭力想在东南亚公约组织的幌子下把印尼、印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸和锡兰拉进美国的势力范围。
    阿鲁齐·卡塔韦纳塔说，美国政策不仅会对稳定亚洲和平的建设性的努力造成混乱，并且也会破坏本着日内瓦谈判的协商精神执行的和平政策。他说，美国企图以不光明的手段在科伦坡国家当中挑拨是非和破坏亚非会议。他希望亚洲国家将勇敢地采取坚定的步骤来制止任何干涉它们内政的行动。
    阿鲁齐·卡塔韦纳塔认为，在印尼和荷兰进行的联邦问题谈判中，美国已经施用压力，威胁或直接破坏印尼的利益。
    国会外交小组委员会主席伦度诺乌九日就美国的东南亚公约组织计划再一次发表意见。他说，尽管杜勒斯主张改变东南亚公约组织的名目，但是这不会改变这种军事联盟的目的。伦度诺乌说，虽然据说是这种拟议中的军事联盟将建立在对落后国家进行经济援助的基础上，但它的实际目的是对付假想敌人的。
