State-owned farms in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province have generally achieved a bumper wheat harvest.

This year, seventeen state-owned farms in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province harvested a total of over 2,060,000 jin of wheat on more than 5,800 mu of land, with an average yield of more than 350 jin per mu. This is the highest record since the establishment of the farms, 36.78% higher than the average yield per mu of farmers in the farm's location.

After the rectification of these state-owned farms from last winter to this spring, the leadership of each farm actively relied on the workers, gave full play to the efficiency of new agricultural tools, improved cultivation techniques, and improved the quality of cultivation. For example, the Jingyang County Demonstration Breeding Farm used a twelve-row seeder for sowing, which resulted in 74,000 more seedlings per mu than the seeding by farmers using drill planters. In addition, timely field management and pest control were carried out, which increased the yield per mu to more than 450 jin. The Dali Production Farm used a ten-inch walking plow for deep plowing and a twelve-row seeder for sowing, with a seedling deficiency rate 11.93% lower than that of farmers, and a yield 78.9% higher than the local average yield.

Farmers who received technical guidance from state-owned farms also achieved high yields. For example, the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Third District of Jingyang County, which received technical guidance from the Jinghui Work Station of the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station, increased its average yield per mu to more than 420 jin, 47.72% higher than the average yield of the entire Third District.

The more than 2,000,000 jin of wheat produced by these seventeen state-owned farms are all high-quality varieties. The farms will allocate a portion of the wheat to the local people's government and other regions for promotion. (Chen Taizhi)

    陕西省关中地区国营农场小麦普遍丰收
    陕西省关中地区十七个国营农场，今年在五千八百多亩土地上共收获了二百零六万多斤小麦，平均每亩产量达三百五十多斤，为建场以来的最高纪录，比农场所在地农民平均每亩产量高百分之三十六点七八。
    这些国营农场经过去冬到今春的整顿后，各场领导上都积极依靠职工，发挥新式农具效能，改进耕作技术，提高耕作质量。如泾阳县示范繁殖农场使用十二行播种机播种，比群众用耩子播种的每亩多出苗七万四千多株，又加适时进行田间管理与防治病虫害，使每亩产量提高到四百五十多斤。大荔生产农场使用十吋步犁深耕，并使用十二行播种机播种，缺苗率比农民低百分之十一点九三，产量比当地平均产量高百分之七十八点九。
    接受国营农场技术指导的农民，也获得了丰产。如泾阳县三区红星农业生产合作社接受了陕西省农业试验场泾惠作业站技术指导，每亩产量平均提高到四百二十多斤，比三区全区平均产量高百分之四十七点七二。
    这十七个国营农场所产两百多万斤小麦，都是优良品种。该场将拨出一部分小麦交给当地人民政府和其他地区推广。　（陈泰志）
