"Everything for Socialism!"
	Xu Jinyan

The good news of the draft constitution's promulgation reached the Tenth Company, a meritorious unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front. The soldiers expressed their determination to heighten vigilance, guard their positions, and actively train to accelerate the modernization and regularization of the unit, as a gift to welcome the birth of the People's Constitution.

Guo Zhengxi, the leader of the First-Class Meritorious Squad of this company, who won a Special Merit Citation for his participation in the Eastern Front summer counter-offensive last year, has been unable to hide his excitement and agitation lately. His work and study are much more intense than before. During the day, he leads his comrades in practicing assault maneuvers on the lush, rugged mountains. Under the scorching sun, he repeatedly demonstrates the movements to the soldiers. His clothes are torn by thorns, his hands and feet are scraped by gravel, his cheeks are covered with dust, and his military cap is soaked with sweat. But he does not feel tired, and he does not easily let the lunch break pass. He lies on the bed with his cultural textbook in his arms, and while others are sound asleep, he is still silently reading. At night, he has to stay up late to prepare the next day's coaching lesson plan.

The promulgation of the draft constitution triggered a series of memories in Guo Zhengxi's mind. He thought of his close comrade-in-arms, the young combat hero, the former commander of the Tenth Company, Teng Daoli. This heroic and lively hero, who only knew about the motherland and forgot about himself, was just a small bugler during the Huaihai Campaign. When the battle was extremely urgent and the company commander had already been killed in action, he cleverly jumped out of the trenches and led his comrades in a counterattack against the besieging enemy, reversing the critical situation and holding the position. On the road to the southwest to pursue and annihilate the fleeing bandits, this courageous hero caught up with the enemy fleeing in vehicles, wiped out an entire platoon with a single Mauser pistol, and captured three cars. He had suffered more than a dozen wounds on his body, and every time it was cloudy and rainy, the bullets tormented him in his stomach. After the pain, he practiced bayonet fighting and grenade throwing with his comrades, singing and dancing. He always said to his comrades with a smile, "We were all suffering people in the past. Now that we have turned over, what does a little hardship matter! To realize socialism is precisely for everyone to enjoy happiness." After the outbreak of the Korean War, the hero angrily joined the ranks of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. On the eve of leaving the motherland, he swore to Chairman Mao: "For the motherland, I will not hesitate to shed the last drop of blood." In last year's summer counterattack, he accepted the last combat mission entrusted to him by the people and fulfilled his solemn oath.

Guo Zhengxi expressed his determination in front of his comrades: "Building socialism has already been stipulated in the draft constitution. In the past, we struggled tirelessly for the freedom and happiness of the people. In the future, we should inherit the legacy of the revolutionary martyrs and use our blood and lives to defend the happiness of the people."

This year he went to Tibet to visit the older brothers of the People's Liberation Army who were defending and building Tibet. As soon as the car crossed the Yalu River, he was struck by a comfortable hometown atmosphere. He opened his eyes wide and stared at the towering buildings, the smoking chimneys, the boundless fields, and the crowds cheering to them in new clothes. This is the motherland! He felt unspeakable happiness, as if he had returned to his hometown after many years of separation and thrown himself into the arms of a loving mother.

On the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, he met the older brothers of the People's Liberation Army who were building and defending the frontier of the motherland. He saw with his own eyes how the older brothers of the People's Liberation Army overcame natural obstacles such as floods, hail, quicksand, and snowstorms day and night with amazing spirit, and opened up smooth roads from the cliffs; he heard with his own ears many heroic deeds of building the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

In Chongqing, he visited the steel mill and the power plant, and the spirit of the worker brothers who worked day and night to study technology moved him.

After the visit, some comrades hoped that he would return to his hometown of Yaoxian, Shaanxi to see his mother and fiancée, but he declined and hurried back to the Korean front.

Recently, Guo Zhengxi received a photo from his fiancée, An Fengxia, and his mother also wrote to urge him to return home. In his reply, he told his lover: "In the past, our poor people suffered. The Kuomintang's conscription made it impossible for our family to reunite. Today, the draft constitution has been promulgated, and the people's happiness is guaranteed, but an even happier socialist society is ahead, waiting for us to strive for.

"Currently, the US-Lee clique is provoking a new war. The tasks entrusted to us by the people of the motherland have not yet been completed. I must intensify my study of modern military science, improve my skills, and prepare to strike at any enemy who dares to invade.

"Tell my mother: In order to defend the country and build a socialist society, I cannot go home yet."

    “一切为了社会主义！”
    许锦炎
    宪法草案公布的喜讯，传到了朝鲜前线志愿军某部功臣第十连，战士们纷纷表示要提高警惕、严守阵地，并且积极练兵，加速部队现代化正规化的建设，作为迎接人民宪法诞生的献礼。
    曾在去年参加东线夏季反击作战，荣立特等功的郭正喜，是这个连队一等功臣班的班长。最近一些日子，他掩盖不住内心的兴奋和激动。工作与学习较往日紧张得多了，白天，带领着班里的同志们在草木茂密的崎岖山岭上练习冲击动作。在炙热的太阳光下，他一次又一次地给战士们作着示范动作，衣服被荆棘割破了，手脚被碎石磨烂了，脸颊被尘土涂满了，军帽被汗水浸透了，但他并不感到累，就连午睡休息时间也不让它轻易过去，抱着文化课本躺在床上，当别人呼呼入睡时，他还在默默地念书。夜里，为了准备第二天的教练教案，还得熬到深夜才能入睡。
    宪法草案的公布，使郭正喜的脑子里引起了一连串的回忆。他想起了亲密的战友、青年战斗英雄、原十连连长藤道礼。这个只知道有祖国，而忘记了自己的英勇活泼的英雄，在淮海战役时还只是一个小司号员，在战斗异常紧急，连的指挥员已经阵亡的情况下，他机智地跃出战壕，带领战友们向围攻过来的敌人反冲锋，挽回了危局，守住了阵地。在进军西南追歼逃匪的路上，这个独胆英雄，撵上乘车逃窜的敌人，用一支匣子枪，全歼敌人一个排，并缴获了三辆汽车。他的身上受过十几处伤，每当天阴下雨，子弹就在他肚子里面折磨他。疼痛过后，他又和战友们一起练刺杀，练投弹，唱歌跳舞。他时时笑嘻嘻地对战友们说：“咱们从前都是受苦人，现在翻了身，吃点苦算什么！实现社会主义，正是要大家来享福。”朝鲜战争爆发后，英雄愤慨地参加了抗美援朝的行列。离开祖国的前夕，他向毛主席宣誓：“为了祖国，不惜流尽最后一滴血。”去年夏季反击战中，他接受人民赋予他的最后一次战斗任务，实现了他庄严的誓言。
    郭正喜在战友们的面前表示自己的决心：“建设社会主义已经在宪法草案里面规定下来了。我们过去曾为人民的自由幸福而斗争不懈，今后，我们更应该继承革命先烈的遗志，用鲜血和生命来保卫人民的幸福。”
    今年他曾到祖国的西藏去慰问保卫和建设西藏的解放军老大哥。车子一过鸭绿江，他就被一种舒适的乡土气息冲激着，他睁大着眼睛，凝视着那一幢幢高耸的楼房，突突冒烟的烟囱，无边无际的田野，穿着崭新衣裳向他们欢呼的人群，这就是祖国呀！他像回到离别多年的故乡，投到了慈母的怀抱里一样，感到说不出的幸福。
    在康藏高原上，他和建设和保卫祖国边疆的解放军老大哥们见了面。他亲眼看到解放军老大哥以惊人的精神夜以继日地战胜了洪水，冰雹，流沙风雪……等等自然障碍，从悬崖绝壁上开辟出平坦的公路来；亲耳听到了许多建设康藏高原的壮烈事迹。
    在重庆，他参观了炼钢厂和发电厂，工人弟兄们废寝忘食钻研技术的精神感动了他。
    慰问工作结束后，有的同志希望他回陕西耀县老家去看看母亲和未婚妻，但他谢绝了，匆匆回到朝鲜前线。
    最近，郭正喜接到未婚妻安凤霞寄给他的一张像片，母亲也来信催他回家。他在回信中告诉他的爱人说：“从前咱们穷人受苦受罪，国民党抓丁弄得咱一家不能团聚，今天宪法草案公布了，人民的幸福有了保证，但更幸福的社会主义还在前面，要我们努力去争取。
    “目前美李匪帮正在挑拨新的战争，祖国人民赋予我们的任务尚未完成，我要加紧学习现代化的军事科学，提高技术，准备打击敢来进犯的敌人。
      “告诉我娘：为了保卫国家建设社会主义社会，我现在还不能回家。”
