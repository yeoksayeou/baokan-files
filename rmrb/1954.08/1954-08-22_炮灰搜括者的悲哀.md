Title: The Tragedy of Cannon Fodder Scroungers

The American ruling clique's publication, "U.S. News & World Report," recently published an article discussing an old problem that most troubles the Pentagon – the lack of cannon fodder. This time they discovered that the situation is even worse: If the United States wants to launch a large-scale war of aggression, not only is manpower limited, but also the physical condition of American youth is generally declining, and fewer and fewer can be pulled in as cannon fodder.

The magazine revealed that during the Korean War, the United States forcibly conscripted 3.6 million young people under the age of 26 to serve as cannon fodder, but 1.7 million of them, nearly half, were eliminated because they were physically unqualified. Among these people, 200,000 to 300,000 suffered from mental disorders or other nervous diseases, tens of thousands suffered from chronic diseases such as heart disease, lung disease, high blood pressure, and asthma, and others had problems with their eyes and ears or had disabilities in their bones and limbs, making it impossible for Wall Street bosses to drive them to sell their lives.

The situation of the future generation is equally serious. According to a physical examination of 4,458 children in public schools in the northeastern United States by an American research institution, 56.6 percent of them were "not up to the minimum health standards."

The American ruling clique would not have cared about this significant and widespread decline in the physical fitness of American youth and children. However, the American military authorities cannot help but worry.

"U.S. News & World Report" wrote: "From a military point of view, this is a very important issue: the United States cannot allow the physical fitness of the population that makes up its future soldiers to continue to decline; because compared with the Soviet Union and China, the United States' manpower is already dwarfed." Therefore, the publication said: American "military leaders are troubled by this."

Why has the physical fitness of American youth and children generally declined? This has deep social roots.

As American monopoly capital increasingly intensifies its exploitation of the broad masses of the people, especially the broad masses of working people, and as it extracts bloody profits through a policy of arms expansion and war preparations that constantly increases the burden on the people, the living standards of the American people are declining day by day. There is an army of more than 5 million unemployed in the United States, millions of small farmers are facing bankruptcy, and 2 million children are forced to leave school to do hard labor. One can imagine how the physical fitness of young people and children living in such widespread unemployment, bankruptcy, poverty, and hunger can not weaken.

In addition to economic reasons, the physical and mental health of American youth and children is also adversely affected by various other factors in the entire "American way of life." British journalist Cardon pointed out in his book "America in 1953": "The 160 million Americans have become objects of systematic depravity and bestialization through the world's most complex and effective 'cultural' tools, the purpose of which is to create a batch of docile, unthinking, unprincipled, and ignorant cannon fodder – imperialist soldiers." The American ruling class uses this degenerate method to manufacture the cannon fodder they need, and as Cardon said: the broad masses of young people and children become its "victims." A report published by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee this March admitted that in 1952, 385,000 juveniles in the United States were interrogated by the court, and more than one million juveniles were taken to the police; from 1948 to 1952, the number of juvenile delinquents in small American towns increased by 41 percent; juvenile drug abuse has also become a "serious problem" in the United States. This decadent atmosphere damages the health of American youth and children as seriously as it damages their minds. Thousands upon thousands of American children are unwilling to go to sports fields and crowd the streets and alleys to read salacious and robbery-inducing comic books that promote war. Many American boys and girls are not disciplined by their parents and go out in gangs late at night to "have fun." American war propaganda has even produced such self-abandoning thoughts in American children: "I won't study anymore, the world is going to be destroyed anyway," "I know I won't live to be twenty-one anyway" (both from "America in 1953"). Under the influence of such an "American way of life," how can the physical and mental health of young people and children not be seriously damaged?

American war planners, in order to create docile cannon fodder, poison the minds of young people and children in many ways, and at the same time, he cannot help but be "troubled" by the general decline in the physical fitness of young people and children due to this poisoning. The problem is so contradictory and so natural.

In order to solve this "trouble" of insufficient cannon fodder, the American war group is paying more and more attention to the sinister policy of so-called "using Asians to fight Asians" and "using Europeans to fight Europeans." Recently, in order to eagerly provoke the Chinese people and undermine peace in Asia, they are rushing to put together a Southeast Asian military bloc. Syngman Rhee's remnants and defeated generals are actually "regarded by American leaders as the pillar in the struggle against Asian communists" (Associated Press dispatch, July 2). The United States also clings to the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, a small group of "bearded soldiers," like a drowning person clutching at a straw. But the more it is like this, the more it exposes the emptiness of the American "paper tiger."

    炮灰搜括者的悲哀
    白云
    美国统治集团的刊物“美国新闻与世界报道”最近刊载一篇文章，谈起了五角大楼所最伤脑筋的一个老问题——炮灰不够的问题。而这回他们发现，情况更加不妙了：美国要发动大规模的侵略战争，不光人力有限，而且美国青年的体格普遍衰退，不能拉去当炮灰的越来越多了。
    这个杂志透露，在侵朝战争期间，美国强征了三百六十万名二十六岁以下的青年去当炮灰，可是其中有一百七十万，即将近一半，因为身体不合格而被淘汰。这些人中，有二、三十万人精神失常或患其他神经病，有好几十万人患着心脏病、肺病、高血压、喘息等慢性病，其他的不是眼睛耳朵有毛病，就是骨骼四肢有残疾，华尔街老板都无法驱使他们去卖命。
    未来一代的情况也同样严重。据一个美国研究机关在美国东北部公立学校中对四千四百五十八名儿童所作的体格检查证明，其中身体“不合最低健康标准”的，占百分之五十六点六。
    美国青年、儿童体格的这种显著的、普遍的衰退现象，美国统治集团本来是不会关心的。但是，美国军事当局却不能不着急。
      “美国新闻与世界报道”写道：“对军事方面说，这是一个十分重要的问题：美国不能听任组成它的未来士兵的人群的体格继续衰退下去；因为和苏联、中国比较，美国的人力本来已相形见绌了。”因此，这个刊物说：美国“军事领袖们为之烦恼”。
    美国青年和儿童的体格为什么会普遍衰退呢？这有着深刻的社会根源。
    由于美国垄断资本日益加重对广大人民、首先是广大劳动人民的剥削，由于他们以不断加重人民负担的扩军备战政策来榨取血腥利润，美国人民的生活水平日益降低，美国有五百万人以上的失业大军，有数百万户小农面临破产，有二百万儿童被迫离开学校去做苦工。可以设想，生活在如此普遍的失业、破产、贫困饥饿中的青年和儿童的体格怎么能不衰弱下去呢？
    除开经济原因之外，美国青年、儿童的身心健康，还受着整个“美国生活方式”中其他各种因素的恶劣影响。英国记者卡东在“一九五三年的美国”一书中指出：“美国的一亿六千万人已成为通过世界上最复杂、最有效的‘文化’工具的媒介而进行有系统的败坏风气与禽兽化活动的对象，其目的是要造成一批驯服、无思想、无原则和无知的炮灰——帝国主义军人。”美国统治阶级用这种堕落手段来制造他们所需要的炮灰，正如卡东所说的：广大的青年儿童成为它的“牺牲者”。美国参议院司法小组委员会今年三月发表的一个报告中承认：一九五二年美国有三十八万五千名少年被法庭审问，一百万以上少年被带交警察；从一九四八年到一九五二年，美国小城镇中少年罪犯增加了百分之四十一；少年儿童吸毒，也成了美国的“严重问题”。这种堕落风气，毁坏美国青年和儿童的健康，正如毁坏他们的心灵一样严重。成千成万的美国儿童不愿上体育场，而拥挤在街头巷尾翻阅诲淫诲盗、宣传战争的小人书。许多美国男女儿童不由父母管束，深夜结伙出外“寻乐”。美国的战争宣传甚至使美国儿童产生了这样的自暴自弃的思想：“我不念书了，世界反正是要炸毁的”，“我知道我无论如何活不到二十一岁”（均见“一九五三年的美国”）。在这样一种“美国生活方式”的影响下面，青年儿童们的身心健康如何能不受到严重损害呢？
    美国战争策划者们为了制造驯服的炮灰，就多方毒害青年儿童们的心理，同时，他又不得不为由于这种毒害而使青年儿童的体格普遍衰退而“烦恼”。问题就是这样矛盾而又这样自然。
    为了解决这个炮灰不足的“烦恼”，美国战争集团越来越重视所谓“用亚洲人打亚洲人”、“用欧洲人打欧洲人”的凶恶政策了。最近，他们为了急于向中国人民挑衅和破坏亚洲的和平，正在赶紧拼凑东南亚军事集团。李承晚的残兵败将，居然“被美国领袖们视作为反对亚洲共产党斗争中的台柱”
  （美联社七月二日电）。对蒋介石卖国集团残余的一小撮“胡子兵”，美国也像溺水者抓住一根稻草一样死不放手。但越是这样，却越加暴露了美国
  “纸老虎”的空虚。
