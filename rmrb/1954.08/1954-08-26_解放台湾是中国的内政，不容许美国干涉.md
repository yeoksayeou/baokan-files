The joint declaration by all democratic parties and people's organizations in China for the liberation of Taiwan is a great and just declaration of the Chinese people. It expresses the common will and firm position and attitude of the 600 million Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. All patriotic people unanimously and enthusiastically support this joint declaration and are determined to strengthen unity and contribute all their strength to complete the sacred historical task of liberating Taiwan.

The joint declaration clearly points out: "In order to safeguard the security and territorial integrity of the motherland, and in order to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and no U.S. occupation or UN trusteeship will be allowed. Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is an exercise of China's sovereignty and is China's internal affair, and no foreign interference will be allowed. If foreign aggressors dare to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, that is interference in China's internal affairs, violation of China's sovereignty, and destruction of China's territorial integrity. They must bear all the serious consequences of this act of aggression."

At this very moment, the U.S. aggressors are openly stepping up their clamor to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating China's territory of Taiwan. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly stated on August 24 that "the basic instructions to the U.S. Navy are to defend the island of Taiwan. The nearby islands controlled by the Nationalists are related to the defense of Taiwan." The arrogant and provocative actions of U.S. Pacific Commander Stump are a clear proof of this. On August 19, Stump led six U.S. naval vessels to intrude into the sea area near Dachen Island, 15 miles off the coast of Zhejiang, China, and on the same day dispatched U.S. naval aircraft, in more than forty batches, about 160 sorties, to operate over the sea near Dachen Island. According to a United Press dispatch on August 19, Stump clamored that "there are sufficient U.S. naval forces in the Taiwan area to repel any threat from the Communists" and that "if the Communists attack Taiwan, the U.S. Navy may not be entirely limited to defensive actions." A United Press reporter also confirmed that Stump was "observing the Chinese mainland with a telescope" on Dachen Island. Such provocative actions and arrogant clamor by Dulles and Stump are certainly not accidental; they are inseparable from the U.S. aggressive group's reckless and adventurous policies.

Since the U.S. aggressive group, after the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina, is attempting to use Taiwan as a base to continue creating international tension, they are doing their utmost to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. However, they cannot find any excuse, so they stubbornly call their armed aggression against China's territory of Taiwan and the southeast coast of China "defending Taiwan." Stump, after returning to Washington from Taiwan and Manila, has been shouting about so-called "defending Taiwan" everywhere. In reality, he is attempting to launch a new adventurous war of aggression. On August 23, he openly admitted in a question-and-answer session with reporters in Washington: "The security situation in the Pacific has greatly improved, and we are now more capable of carrying out destructive retaliation." See, what an arrogant tone of a warmonger! In fact, everyone knows that the so-called "defending Taiwan" is nothing but complete nonsense from U.S. war instigators. Taiwan is not America's Honolulu. What reason does the United States have to "defend Taiwan"?

All peace-loving countries must be highly vigilant against this war clamor from U.S. warmongers. We adhere to the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, as repeatedly stated in the joint communiques of the premiers of China and India and the premiers of China and Burma, and we will not waver in the slightest because of the clamor of U.S. warmongers. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, not only to safeguard their own sovereignty and territorial integrity and resolve their own internal affairs, but also to eliminate a source of trouble by which the United States creates international tension and new war crises. This will further consolidate peace in Asia and the world, expand the area of collective peace, and enable all countries to coexist peacefully and enjoy all the benefits of international trade and peace.

The Chinese people have solemnly declared to the world: Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair, and no foreign interference will be allowed. Is there anyone in the U.S. aggressive group who can object to this self-evident truth?

History is the most ruthless and also the most just. In the 13th century, the then Chinese government established a patrol inspectorate in Taiwan to administer Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. In the Qing Dynasty, Taiwan Prefecture was established, under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province, and later changed to a province, directly under the central government. Who can erase this long historical record? Therefore, even during the period when Japanese aggressors occupied Taiwan, all countries in the world still recognized Taiwan as Chinese; anyone who wants to occupy Taiwan cannot escape the crime of invading China and cannot escape the just punishment of history!

Even if we only look at the U.S. government's diplomatic documents, it is not difficult to understand that interfering in the Chinese people's handling of their own internal affairs—liberating Taiwan—will inevitably lead to serious consequences. In August 1949, after the Chinese People's Liberation War achieved a great victory, the U.S. State Department published the "White Paper on Sino-American Relations," which admitted: "According to the Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943, the United States and China declared that Taiwan should be returned to China." It acknowledged that "the people of Taiwan have been under alien rule for fifty years and therefore welcome Chinese liberation. During the period of Japanese occupation, the greatest hope of the people of Taiwan was to return to the motherland." On December 23, 1949, U.S. State Department Special Order No. 28, "Policy Propaganda Instructions Regarding Taiwan," also acknowledged: "Taiwan is politically, geographically, and strategically a part of China, and it is not particularly outstanding or important. Although it has been ruled by Japan for fifty years, it is historically Chinese. Politically and militarily, it is strictly a Chinese responsibility." Therefore, this "propaganda instruction" estimated that invading Taiwan would not have good results. It wrote: "We should make it clear when necessary that if the United States acquires bases in Taiwan, sends troops there, supplies weapons, sends naval vessels, or takes any similar actions, it will involve the United States in a long-term adventure, which, at best, will create a new stalemate area; at worst, it may involve us in open war. It also exposes the United States to fierce propaganda attacks, especially since the Chinese people will oppose our militarism, imperialism, and intervention."

This estimate is not wrong. The U.S. aggressive group's militaristic and imperialistic stance and intervention policy on the Taiwan issue, as part of its entire adventurous aggression plan, will certainly be met with increasingly fierce condemnation and opposition from the Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world. Moreover, more dangerously, this policy of the United States is sufficient to cause a new war danger.

Then, would it be possible to resolve the Taiwan issue by changing the approach and adopting so-called "trusteeship" or other similar methods? The joint declaration also answered that this is absolutely not allowed. Even the U.S. State Department's past records prove that it is impossible to divide Taiwan in any way. In a response to the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee on the Taiwan issue on February 9, 1950, the U.S. State Department stated: "If the U.S. government seeks to establish a non-Chinese administration in Taiwan through the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, through the United Nations, or through a plebiscite supervised by the Far Eastern Commission, this would be interpreted by almost everyone on the Chinese mainland and throughout Asia as this government violating its guarantees and abandoning our consistent policy of respecting China's territorial integrity, and attempting to separate Taiwan from China. From the point of view of our interests in Asia, including the mainland, the important point is not the technical reasons we can put forward for taking this step, but how the people of Asia will view our doing so."

Taiwan is the territory of great China, and there is absolutely no such thing as trusteeship! Moreover, UN trusteeship is actually to turn China's internal affairs into international issues, that is, to directly turn the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan into an excuse for U.S. warmongers to provoke a world war. This is absolutely not allowed! And the U.S. aggressive group is now trying its best to find opportunities and create excuses, attempting to provoke a new international war from the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, an internal affair, in order to achieve its goal of destroying peace. This must be guarded against.

We Chinese people cannot be intimidated by any imperialism. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We must save our eight million compatriots in Taiwan who are in dire straits, and we must thoroughly complete our liberation cause. This is the historical path that the Chinese people must take, and our taking our own path has nothing to do with any foreign country. However, if foreign aggressors are determined to continue to be enemies of the Chinese people, insist on interfering in China's internal affairs, and insist on obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, then no matter what excuses they find, they will never be able to escape the major responsibility of bearing all serious consequences.

The Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan cannot be changed, and the fate of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to be eliminated is sealed. In Taiwan and the coastal islands, China must exercise its sovereignty. These places must absolutely not allow U.S. aggressors to interfere!

### 解放台湾是中国的内政，不容许美国干涉

    解放台湾是中国的内政，不容许美国干涉
    中国各民主党派、各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言，是中国人民伟大的正义的宣言。它表达了中国六万万人民解放台湾的共同意志和坚定不移的立场和态度。所有爱国的人都一致热烈拥护这个联合宣言，决心加强团结，贡献一切力量，为完成解放台湾的神圣的历史任务而奋斗。
    联合宣言明白地指出：“为了保障祖国安全和领土完整，为了保障亚洲及世界的和平，中国人民一定要解放台湾。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，决不容许美国侵占，也决不容许联合国托管。解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，是行使中国的主权，是中国的内政，决不容许任何外国干涉。如果外国侵略者敢于阻挠中国人民解放台湾，那就是干涉中国的内政，侵犯中国的主权，破坏中国的领土完整，他们就必须承担这一侵略行为的一切严重后果。”
    正在这个时候，美国的侵略分子却公然加紧叫嚣要阻挠中国人民解放中国的领土台湾。美国国务卿杜勒斯在八月二十四日公然说什么“对美国海军的基本指示是保卫台湾本岛。国民党控制的附近的岛屿是跟台湾防务有关系的。”太平洋美军总司令斯图普狂妄的挑衅行动就是一个显著的证明。斯图普在八月十九日率领了美国海军军舰六艘侵入距离我国浙江海岸十五英里的大陈岛一带海面活动，并于同一天派出美国海军飞机，分四十几批，约一百六十几架次，在大陈岛附近海面上空活动。据合众社八月十九日电讯称，斯图普叫嚣说“在台湾地区有充分的美国海军部队可以打退共产党的任何威胁”，“如果共产党进攻台湾，美国海军可能不完全限于采取防御行动”。合众社记者还证实斯图普在大陈岛上“用望远镜察看中国大陆”。杜勒斯和斯图普的这种挑衅行动和狂妄的叫嚣当然不是偶然的，它是和美国侵略集团不顾后果的冒险政策分不开的。
    由于美国侵略集团在朝鲜停战和印度支那恢复和平之后，企图以台湾为基地，继续制造国际紧张局势，因此，他们极力要阻挡中国人民解放台湾。但是他们又找不到任何的借口，于是他们就把他们对中国的领土台湾和中国东南沿海的武装侵略行为，硬叫做“保卫台湾”。斯图普由台湾、马尼拉回到华盛顿，到处都在叫喊所谓“保卫台湾”，实际上他是企图发动新的冒险侵略战争的。八月二十三日他在华盛顿发表一篇答记者问，就直认不讳地说：“太平洋的安全地位大大改善了，我们已更有能力进行摧毁性的报复”。看，这是多么狂妄的好战分子的口吻！其实谁也知道，所谓“保卫台湾”只是美国的战争挑拨者的彻头彻尾的胡说。台湾并不是美国的檀香山，美国有什么理由来“保卫台湾”呢？
    对于美国好战分子的这种战争叫嚣，爱好和平的各国必须提起高度的警惕。我们坚持中、印两国总理和中、缅两国总理在会谈公报中所一再申述的互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，决不因美国好战分子的叫嚣而有丝毫动摇。中国人民决心解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，不但是为了保障自己的主权和领土完整，解决自己的内政问题；而且是为了消除美国借以制造国际紧张局势和制造新战争危机的一个祸根，这将会更加巩固亚洲及世界的和平，扩大集体和平的地区，使各国和平共处，享受国际贸易和和平的一切利益。
    中国人民已经向全世界庄严地宣告：台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，解放台湾是中国的内政，决不容许任何外国干涉。美国侵略集团的人们，有谁能够对于这种天经地义的道理提出反对的理由来呢？
    历史是最无情也是最公正的。在十三世纪，中国当时的政府就在台湾设了巡检司管辖台湾、澎湖。至清朝，设台湾府，属福建省管，后改行省，直属中央。这个悠久的历史纪录，有谁能够抹煞呢？因此，在日本侵略者侵占台湾的时期，世界各国仍然公认台湾是中国的；谁要侵占台湾就逃不了侵略中国的罪名，就逃不了历史的正义的惩罚！
    即使仅仅查看美国政府的外交文件，也不难懂得，干涉中国人民处理自己的内政问题——解放台湾，必然要引起严重的后果。一九四九年八月，当中国人民解放战争取得伟大胜利以后，美国国务院发表了“中美关系”白皮书，它承认：“根据一九四三年十二月一日开罗宣言，美国与中国宣布台湾应归还中国。”它承认“台湾人民受异族统治达五十年，因之欢迎中国解放。于日本占领时期中，台湾人民最大之希望为重归祖国。”一九四九年十二月二十三日，美国国务院特别命令第二十八号“关于台湾的政策宣传指示”中也承认：“台湾在政治上、地理上和战略上都是中国的一部分，它一点也不特别出色或者重要。虽然它被日本统治了五十年，然而从历史上看，它是中国的。在政治上和军事上，它是一种严格的中国的责任。”因此，这个“宣传指示”估计到侵略台湾是不会有好结果的。它写道：“我们应该在必要时说明白，美国在台湾取得基地、派军队去、供应武器、派海军船只去、或者采取任何类似的行动，都将使美国卷入长期的冒险中，这种冒险弄得好是造成新的僵持地区；弄得不好可能卷入公开战争。它并且使美国遭到猛烈的宣传攻击，特别是中国人民都将反对我们的军国主义、帝国主义和干涉。”
    这个估计不差，美国侵略集团对于台湾问题的军国主义、帝国主义的立场和干涉政策，作为它的整个冒险侵略计划的一部分，当然要遭到中国人民及全世界爱好和平人民愈来愈激烈的谴责和反对。而且更危险的是：美国这种政策足以引起一个新的战争的危险。
    那末，如果改变一个方式，采用所谓“托管”之类的办法来解决台湾问题行不行呢？联合宣言也回答了，这是决不容许的。甚至连美国国务院过去的纪录也证明，要用任何方式分割台湾都是行不通的。一九五○年二月九日美国国务院就台湾问题给美国众议院外交委员会的答复中说：“如果美国政府希图通过驻日盟军总部，通过联合国，或通过远东委员会所监督之下的公民投票，而在台湾建立一个非中国的行政当局，这就会被中国大陆上以及全亚洲几乎一切的人解释为，本政府违背了它的保证，并背弃我们一向尊重中国领土完整的政策，而企图使台湾脱离中国。从我们在亚洲包括大陆在内的利益的观点来看，重要之点不在于我们可以提出采取这种步骤的技术理由，而是在于亚洲人民对于我们这样做将如何看法。”
    台湾是伟大的中国的领土，决无托管之可言！何况由联合国托管实际上就是要把中国的内政问题变为国际问题，就是要使中国人民解放台湾直接变为美国好战分子挑动世界战争的口实，这是万万不行的！而美国侵略集团现在正是要极力寻找机会，制造借口，企图从中国人民解放台湾这样一个内政问题上，来挑动一个新的国际战争，以达到它破坏和平的目的。这是必须警惕的。
    我们中国人民是任何帝国主义吓不倒的。中国人民一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，我们一定要拯救处于水深火热之中的台湾八百万同胞，一定要彻底完成我们的解放事业。这是中国人民非走不可的历史道路，我们走自己的路是和任何外国不相干的。但是，如果外国侵略者决心继续与中国人民为敌，硬要干涉中国内政，硬要阻挡中国人民解放台湾，那末，不管他们寻找什么借口，都决不可能解脱他们承担一切严重后果的重大责任。
    中国人民解放台湾的决心是不能改变的，蒋介石卖国集团被消灭的命运是定了的。在台湾和沿海的岛屿上，中国必须行使自己的主权。这些地方绝对不能容许美国侵略者染指！
