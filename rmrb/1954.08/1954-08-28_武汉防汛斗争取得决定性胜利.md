Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 27th: Zhang Pinghua, Deputy Commander of the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters, stated in his report on flood control and disaster relief work at the First Session of the First Wuhan Municipal People's Congress that the people of Wuhan have achieved a first-stage, decisive victory in their struggle against the floods. He said: The tense struggle against the floods in Wuhan has lasted for nearly two months. Since July 18th, when the Yangtze River water level at Wuhan Customs exceeded the highest level of 28.28 meters in 1931, it has continued for more than a month; on August 18th, the water level at Wuhan Customs was 29.73 meters, nearly 1.5 meters higher than the highest level in 1931. Such a high water level persisting for so long poses a very serious threat to Wuhan. Without timely and vigorous strengthening of flood control work, without the raising and reinforcement of dikes over the years, without promptly inspecting the dikes and repairing dangerous spots, and without strengthening wave-resistant facilities to block wind and waves from attacking the dikes, Wuhan would probably have been submerged long ago. We have ensured the safety of Wuhan under the high Yangtze River water level of nearly 30 meters, a situation that was unimaginable under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. In 1931, when the Yangtze River water level in Hankou was only 26.94 meters, the dikes breached, but this year's high water level is 2.79 meters higher than that time, and the dikes, defended by a large flood control force, still guarantee the safety of the entire city. This cannot but be recognized as a great achievement in flood control work.

Why was Wuhan able to achieve such success in flood control? Zhang Pinghua said: It is mainly due to the great strength of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. There were 200,000 people in Wuhan directly participating in flood control work, including workers, soldiers, cadres, farmers, students, and urban working people from all walks of life. Soldiers and cadres demonstrated boundless loyalty to the people, courage, and wisdom in the flood control struggle. Many women participated in carrying earth, building dikes, and emergency repairs like men, or engaged in other work. More than 2,700 automobile drivers and more than 8,000 crew members actively transported flood control materials and equipment. The flood control army also included pumping machine workers and technicians transferred from all over the country by the Central People's Government to support Wuhan's flood control, including many water conservancy experts, water conservancy engineers, teachers and students from water conservancy schools, and other technical personnel, including a large number of administrative management personnel, trade workers, and medical workers. This flood control army, led and organized by the Communist Party and the People's Government, demonstrated a heroic and tenacious fighting spirit in the struggle. On July 29th, the soldiers defending the Xiaozhanggong Dike used a will more tenacious than the flood to buy time to repair dangerous spots, turning the dike from danger to safety. The dangerous spot in Danshui Pond was also rescued in this way. When the Xiaozhanggong Dike was in critical condition, nearby residents displayed a high degree of self-sacrifice and participated in the rescue. When the Wuchang Wuqingzha Dike section collapsed, nearby farmers voluntarily dug up their vegetable gardens to obtain earth for the rescue. In particular, the working masses played a backbone role in all aspects of the flood control struggle. Regardless of the factories inside or outside the dikes, the workers actively participated in flood control while maintaining production, demonstrating the tenacity of the working class. When two sluice gates on the Hanyang Dike leaked, the workers of the Hanshui Railway Bridge used advanced steel sheet piling technology to repair and protect them. This great spirit of sacrificing everything for the country and the people is the main source of victory in the first stage of flood control.

Zhang Pinghua then pointed out: This flood control was carried out under the leadership and concern of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and with the strong support of the people of the whole country. The transportation tools used in this flood control included 30 train locomotives, 645 freight cars, more than 1,000 automobiles, 55 tugboats, more than 300 barges, and 1,500 wooden boats. More than 1.7 million cubic meters of mud were mined and transported, and the amount of stone materials mined and transported was also large, with more than 87,000 cubic meters used in Hankou alone. More than 174,000 tree trunks were used for wave-resistant wooden rafts. More than 4.7 million gunny sacks were allocated to Wuhan from all over the country. The amount of other materials and equipment used for flood control was also very large. Because all parts of the country mobilized a large amount of manpower and materials to support the people of Wuhan in flood control, we were able to complete the dike reinforcement and raising projects in various stages according to plan, always staying ahead of the flood and ensuring the safety of Wuhan.

While fighting the flood, the Disaster Relief Office of the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters carried out disaster relief work. The disaster situation in Wuhan was caused on the one hand by the difficulty in draining accumulated water in some low-lying areas, and on the other hand by the flooding of areas outside the dike protection line. The People's Government is very concerned about the disaster victims and has issued emergency relief funds of 3.188 billion yuan and loaned 1.84 billion yuan to help the disaster victims restore production and rebuild their homes. More than 800 medical personnel in Wuhan are treating the disaster victims, and various hospitals have vacated more than 450 beds for the disaster victims, and also helped the disaster victims organize 64 maternity and child health stations. Some soldiers of the People's Liberation Army sacrificed their lives to rescue disaster victims from the floods.

Zhang Pinghua said: To win the first stage of the Wuhan flood control struggle, we must first thank the wise leadership and close care of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao, and the support of the people of the whole country. Whenever Wuhan encountered difficulties in the flood control struggle, the Central Committee quickly came to help us overcome them. As early as late June, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, together with other departments, allocated more than 300 pumping machines (more than 8,000 horsepower) to support Wuhan in draining accumulated water. When Wuhan's drainage power was insufficient, the Central People's Government transferred a power generation train from Taiyuan. The leadership of the CPC Central South Bureau, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and Government, and the support of the people of Hubei Province have all played a great positive role in the Wuhan flood control struggle. The temporary storage of floodwater in some lakes in Hubei Province has reduced the pressure of the flood on Wuhan. This shows the great strength of the worker-peasant alliance. The people of Wuhan should also, after flood control, help farmers restore production as much as possible according to rural needs.

Zhang Pinghua said: We also want to thank the support of the People's Liberation Army. They are highly organized, courageous and creative. Whichever dike they defend, the flood control work there is done particularly well. We want to thank the People's Air Force for sending airplanes, and the People's Navy and Railway Corps for sending divers to support our flood control struggle.

Zhang Pinghua finally emphasized: Now the people of Wuhan are in the decisive stage of the flood control struggle. The overall situation has improved, but the current flood control struggle is still very tense and very difficult. It is impossible for the water level at Wuhan Customs to recede below the warning level in less than a month. Although the dikes have been reinforced, problems are inevitable after prolonged immersion in high water levels; moreover, floods may still occur in the Hanshui River, and there may be local rainfall or large wind and waves in the upper or middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Therefore, we must be very vigilant and must not be negligent or complacent. We have all the conditions to finally overcome the flood and prevent any eventuality from happening. The task now is to persevere in the tenacious battle and fight for the final victory over the flood and ensure the safety of Wuhan.

    武汉防汛斗争取得决定性胜利
   【新华社武汉二十七日电】武汉市防汛总指挥部副总指挥张平化在武汉市第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的关于防汛救灾工作报告中指出：武汉市人民在和洪水斗争中，已取得第一阶段带有决定性的胜利。他说：武汉市防汛的紧张斗争已近两个月。七月十八日武汉关长江水位超过了一九三一年最高水位二八点二八公尺以来，到现在已经持续了一个多月；八月十八日武汉关水位是二九点七三公尺，比一九三一年的最高水位高出将近一公尺半。这样高的水位持续这样久，对武汉市的威胁是非常严重的。如果没有及时大力加强防汛工作，没有历期堤防加高加固工程，没有抓紧检查堤防和对险工的及时抢修，没有加强防浪设备来阻挡风浪对堤防的袭击，武汉市恐怕早已被洪水淹没了。我们在接近三十公尺高的长江高水位下确保住武汉市的安全，这种情况是国民党反动统治时期所不可想像的。一九三一年汉口长江水位才二六点九四公尺就已决堤，今年的高水位比那时高过二点七九公尺，有着防汛大军防守的堤防仍然保障着全市的安全。这不能不承认是防汛工作的巨大成就。
    武汉市防汛为什么能够获得这样的成就呢？张平化说：主要是依靠了在共产党和人民政府领导下的人民群众的伟大力量。武汉市直接参加防汛工作的就有二十万人，其中包括工人、部队战士、机关干部、农民、学生和城市劳动群众等各界人民。部队战士和机关干部在防汛斗争中，表现出对人民无限忠诚的英勇和智慧。许多妇女和男子一样参加了挑土、筑堤和抢险，或从事其他工作。积极抢运防汛物资和器材的汽车驾驶人员有二千七百多人，船员有八千多人。防汛大军中还包括中央人民政府从各地调来支援武汉市防汛的抽水机工人和技术人员，包括很多水利专家、水利工程人员、水利学校的师生和其他技术人员，包括大批行政管理人员、贸易工作人员和医务工作人员。共产党和人民政府领导和组织的这一支防汛大军，在斗争中表现了英勇顽强的战斗精神。七月二十九日，防守在小张公堤上的部队战士们，用比洪水更加顽强的意志，争取时间抢修险工，使堤防转危为安。丹水池的险工也是这样抢住的。小张公堤危急时，附近的居民发挥高度自我牺牲的精神，参加抢险。武昌武庆闸堤段脱坡时，附近的农民自愿挖掉自己的菜园，取土抢险。特别是工人群众，在防汛斗争的各方面都起着骨干作用。无论堤外堤内的工厂，职工们一面积极参加防汛，一面坚持生产，表现了工人阶级的顽强性。汉阳堤防两处闸门漏水，汉水铁桥工人便用打钢板桩的先进技术抢修和防护下来。这种为国家、为人民不惜牺牲一切的伟大精神，就是防汛第一阶段胜利的主要泉源。
    张平化接着指出：这次防汛是在中共中央和中央人民政府的领导、关怀下和全国人民的大力支援下进行的。这次防汛动用的运输工具有火车机车三十台、货车六百四十五辆、汽车一千多辆、拖轮五十五艘、驳船三百多只、木划千五百只，采运的泥土一百七十多万公方，采运的石料数量也大，仅汉口就用了八万七千多公方。防浪木排用木十七万四千多根。从全国调拨给武汉市的麻袋达四百七十多万条。其他防汛所用物资器材的数量也很大。由于全国各地动员了大量的人力物力来支援武汉人民防汛，我们才能按计划完成各期堤防加固加高工程，一直走在洪水前面，确保了武汉市的安全。
    在防汛斗争的同时，武汉市防汛总指挥部救灾办公室进行了救灾工作。武汉市的灾情，一方面是某些低洼地区积水难排，一方面是堤防确保线以外地区被洪水淹没造成的。人民政府对灾民非常关怀，已先后发出急救款三十一亿八千多万元，并贷出十八亿四千多万元帮助灾民生产自救。武汉市有八百多医务人员为灾民治病，各医院为灾民腾出了四百五十多张病床，还帮助灾民组织了六十四个妇幼保健站。人民解放军战士有的为从洪水中救出灾民，牺牲了自己的生命。
    张平化说：武汉市防汛斗争获得第一阶段的胜利，我们首先应该感谢以毛主席为首的中共中央和中央人民政府的英明领导和亲切的关怀，以及全国人民的支援。武汉市防汛斗争中无论遇到什么困难，中央都迅速地来帮助我们克服。早在六月下旬，中央人民政府水利部即会同其他部门调拨三百多部抽水机（八千多马力），支持武汉市排除积水。武汉市排水动力不够时，中央人民政府又从太原市调来了发电列车。中南、湖北党政领导机关的领导和湖北人民的支援，对于武汉市防汛斗争都起着极大的积极作用。湖北省一些湖泊的暂时蓄洪，减轻了洪水对武汉市的压力。这显示了工农联盟的伟大力量。武汉市人民也要在防汛后，根据农村的需要，尽可能帮助农民恢复生产。
    张平化说：我们还要感谢人民解放军的支援。他们组织性很强，既勇敢又富有创造性。那段堤有他们防守，那里的防汛工作就作得特别好。我们要感谢人民空军派飞机，人民海军和铁道部队派潜水员来支援了我们的防汛斗争。
    张平化最后强调指出：现在武汉人民正处在防汛斗争的决战阶段。总的形势已经好转，但是当前的防汛斗争还是非常紧张，非常艰苦。武汉关水位要退到警戒水位以下，没有一个多月的时间是不可能的。虽然堤防加固了，但在长时期高水位浸蚀下，难免不出问题；而且汉水还可能发生洪水，长江上游或中游还会局部降雨，或遭大风浪袭击。因此，我们必须十分警惕，决不能疏忽大意，麻痹松懈。我们具备着最后战胜洪水的一切条件，不让万一情况发生。今后的任务是：坚持顽强战斗，为最后战胜洪水确保武汉安全而斗争。
