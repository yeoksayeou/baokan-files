Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 21st: The British Labour Party delegation, headed by Mr. Attlee, returned to Shenyang by train from Anshan on the evening of August 21st. During their two-day stay in Northeast China, they visited Anshan, China's largest iron and steel center, and an agricultural production cooperative near Shenyang.

The delegation will fly to Tangshan tomorrow and then return to Beijing.

The delegates visited the seamless steel tube plant, the large rolling mill, the No. 7 blast furnace, and the steelmaking plant in Anshan. They were accompanied by Hua Ming, acting general manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and leaders from the factories and trade unions.

Hua Ming said that the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant was almost completely ruined after the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. However, in the past five years, with the help of the Soviet Union, Anshan has been built into a metallurgical complex, including fifty-five factories and mines, and is one of the largest metallurgical complexes in the world.

During the Japanese occupation, nine blast furnaces produced 1.3 million tons of iron annually, but now five blast furnaces produce 200,000 tons more per year.

The latest automated equipment of this complex was supplied by the Soviet Union, and workers are learning new technologies from Soviet experts. Without the help of the Soviet Union, this steel center could not have been restored to its current scale so quickly.

The delegates also visited workers' canteens, a nursery, and a workers' sanatorium located in a green valley surrounded by trees. They then drove to the workers' dormitories in Anshan.

The day before, the delegates went to the Gaokan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, 20 kilometers east of Shenyang, beside the Hun River. The farmers of this cooperative welcomed them with fruits and eggs and explained how the cooperative is managed. The delegates were very interested to hear that the cooperative implements the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women. The delegates visited two farmer families and a nursery in the cooperative. They also saw tractors and new farm implements, as well as farmland with lush green rice, corn, and sorghum. Burke, on behalf of the Labour Party delegation, expressed gratitude for the farmers' hospitality.

    英国工党代表团到鞍山参观
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】以艾德礼先生为首的英国工党代表团二十一日晚间乘火车从鞍山回到沈阳。他们在中国东北停留的两天中，参观了我国最大的冶炼中心鞍山和沈阳附近的一个农业生产合作社。
    代表团明天将飞往唐山，然后回北京。
    代表们在鞍山参观了无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂、第七号高炉和炼钢厂。陪同他们参观的有鞍山钢铁公司代总经理华明和工厂和工会的领导人员。
    华明说，鞍山钢铁厂在抗日战争和解放战争以后几乎是一片废墟。但是在过去五年中，在苏联帮助下，鞍山已被建成为一个冶炼联合工厂，其中包括五十五个工厂和矿场，是世界上最大的冶炼联合工厂之一。
    在日本占领期间，九个高炉每年生产一百三十万吨铁，现在五个高炉每年还多生产二十万吨。
    这个联合工厂的最新式的自动化装备是苏联供给的，工人们向苏联专家们学习新式技术。没有苏联的帮助，这个钢铁中心是不能这样快恢复到目前的规模的。
    代表们还参观了工人的食堂、一个托儿所和设在有绿树环绕的青翠的山谷里的一所工人疗养院。他们接着驱车前往鞍山工人的宿舍。
    在前一天，代表们前往沈阳以东二十公里、浑河旁边的高坎村的农业生产合作社。这个合作社的农民用水果和鸡蛋欢迎他们，并向他们解释这个合作社是怎样管理的。代表们听说合作社实行男女同工同酬的办法时感到很有兴趣。代表们参观了两个农民家庭和这个合作社的一个托儿所。他们还看到拖拉机和新式农具以及长着一片碧绿的稻子、玉米和高粱的农田。伯克代表工党代表团对农民们的款待表示感谢。
