    It's a Competition, Not Competition
    In the July issues of the *Southern Daily*, two educational reports reflecting workers' labor competitions were published. One was "It's a Competition, Not Competition" (July 6th), and the other was "Upstairs in the Sugar Boiling House" (July 2nd). These two reports used two typical examples to illustrate some basic issues related to labor competitions from two different angles.
    "It's a Competition, Not Competition" describes the transformation of the Class A red sugar screening team of the state-owned Shunde Sugar Factory in the labor competition and the ideological struggle of a worker. It explains the harm of competition to the country and the workers themselves. At the same time, it uses the workers' new actions and new production achievements after the ideological transformation to clarify the meaning and role of competition. The report begins by narrating how four workers in the Class A red sugar screening team, before understanding the difference between competition and contest, sought "dishonest methods" for the sake of winning the red flag and bonuses. They took false samples, falsely reported results, and deliberately made things difficult for other teams, attempting to gain honor by deception. However, capitalist competitive methods could not bring them real honor; on the contrary, they brought them distress and unease. Because their false reporting of results and self-interest at the expense of others not only deceived the state, not only "aroused the suspicion and dissatisfaction of some workers in other teams," but also harmed their own work. As the report writes, "Since taking false samples, everyone thought they were sure to get the red flag, so they didn't work hard, and the master worker rarely taught techniques, so everyone's skills could not be improved, and they didn't even know how to 'fake' the samples to meet the standards. As a result, the rotating red flag for February was still taken by Team B." In this situation, the apprentice worker He Pei began to feel distressed. His distress affected other workers, and everyone became increasingly dissatisfied with Chen Xin (the worker who proposed and insisted on taking false samples), and the group became increasingly disunited. Later, the Party and trade union organizations of the factory strengthened ideological leadership over the competition. After a painful ideological struggle, the workers of Class A, especially He Pei, exposed and criticized the past erroneous thoughts and behaviors, and were determined to "return to the right path." And when the workers raised their awareness and established a correct labor attitude, a new atmosphere appeared in the labor competition. The report tells readers that since then, the workers of Class A took the lead in promoting the Soviet Union's advanced sugar screening experience and helped other teams promote it; they also used their brains to find tricks, and even the apprentice worker He Pei, who had low skills, as well as Chen Xin, the proposer and advocate of "dishonest methods," put forward valuable suggestions and found real tricks. Because they actively improved their skills, they broke through the state targets in April and received rewards, and then won the glorious red flag in May. The vivid facts narrated in the report powerfully criticized and opposed the capitalist competition trend, while praising and advocating the socialist competition ideology, pointing out the correct direction of effort for the broad masses of workers.
    "Upstairs in the Sugar Boiling House" illustrates how workers should carry out socialist labor competition from a positive perspective by introducing the advanced deeds of the Deng Wenxi group of Shunde Sugar Factory. The article writes on the one hand how this advanced group, in the competition, gave selfless help to the backward ones in the identity of the advanced and in the attitude of comrades, so that a backward group also got significant improvement; on the other hand, it introduces how the workers of this group helped each other, carried out criticism and self-criticism, in order to improve their skills together to complete the national plan. This report also vividly reveals the socialist competition principle of the advanced leading the backward, in order to achieve universal upsurge.
    The labor competition carried out by the broad masses of workers is not only changing the production face of our enterprises, but also changing the workers' thoughts and feelings. In the competition, the workers' socialist consciousness is improving day by day, and new labor attitudes are gradually established. Our newspapers must keenly pay attention to how the working masses are overcoming backward things and building new things in fact and in daily labor, and publicize and disseminate these new things with great efforts.

    是竞赛，不是竞争
    在七月份的南方日报上，刊出了两篇富有教育意义的反映工人劳动竞赛的通讯。一篇是“是竞赛，不是竞争”（七月六日）；另一篇是“煮糖楼上”（七月二日）。这两篇通讯运用两个典型的事例，从两个不同的角度，阐明了有关劳动竞赛的一些基本问题。
    “是竞赛，不是竞争”通过国营顺德糖厂赤糖筛甲班工人在劳动竞赛中的转变和一个工人的思想斗争过程的描述，说明竞争对于国家、对于工人自己的害处；同时又用工人们在思想转变后新的行动和新的生产成绩，来阐明竞赛的意义和作用。这篇通讯一开始叙述了赤糖筛甲班的四个工人，在不懂得竞争和竞赛的区别之前，如何为了争红旗、争奖金而找“邪门”，他们采假样、虚报成绩，故意为难别班，企图以此骗取荣誉。但是资本主义的竞争手段并不能为他们带来真正的荣誉；恰恰相反，给他们带来了苦闷和不安。因为他们虚报成绩和损人利己的结果，不但骗了国家，不但“引起别班的一些工人的怀疑和不满”，而且也损害了自己的工作。正如通讯所写的，“自从采假样以来，大家以为有把握拿到红旗了，所以工作不起劲，而师傅也很少教技术，大家的技术不能提高，甚至采假样也不知怎么‘假’法才达得到标准。结果，二月份的流动红旗还是让乙班拿去了。”在这种情况下，培养工何培开始苦闷起来。他的苦闷又影响到别的工人，大家越来越对陈新（提出和坚持采假样的工人）不满，组内越来越不团结了。后来该厂的党和工会组织加强了对竞赛的思想领导，甲班的工人，特别是何培，经过一场痛苦的思想斗争之后，揭露和批判了过去的错误思想和行为，下决心“改邪归正”。而当工人们提高了觉悟，树立了正确的劳动态度，劳动竞赛便出现了新气象。通讯告诉读者，此后甲班工人带头推广了苏联的先进筛糖经验，并帮助别班进行推广；他们还开动脑筋找寻窍门，就连技术很低的培养工何培，以及当初是“邪门”的提议者和坚持者的陈新，也提出了有价值的建议和找到了真正的窍门。由于他们积极提高技术，四月份突破了国家指标，获得奖励，接着在五月份又得到了光荣红旗。通讯所叙述的这个生动的事实，有力地批判和反对了资本主义的竞争倾向，同时表扬和提倡了社会主义的竞赛思想，为工人群众指出了正确的努力方向。
    “煮糖楼上”则是通过介绍顺德糖厂邓文溪小组的先进事迹，从正面来说明工人应如何进行社会主义的劳动竞赛。文中一方面写出了这个先进小组在竞赛中如何以先进者的身份和同志的态度，给后进者以无私的帮助，使一个后进的小组也得到了显著的提高；另一方面介绍了这个小组的工人们为了完成国家计划，如何互相帮助，开展批评和自我批评，来共同提高技术。这篇通讯同样生动地揭示了先进者带动落后者，以便达到普遍高涨的社会主义竞赛原则。
    广大工人群众所进行的劳动竞赛，不仅改变着我们企业的生产面貌，而且改变着工人们的思想感情。在竞赛当中，工人们的社会主义觉悟天天在提高，新的劳动态度逐步树立起来。我们的报纸正是要目光敏锐地注意工人群众在事实上、在日常劳动中怎样在克服落后的东西，建设新的东西，并对这些新东西大加宣扬，大力传播。（方初）
