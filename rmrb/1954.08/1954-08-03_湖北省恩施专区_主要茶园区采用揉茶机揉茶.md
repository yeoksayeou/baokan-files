Enshi Prefecture in Hubei Province:
Major Tea-Producing Areas Adopt Tea-Rolling Machines for Tea Processing

The major tea-producing areas of Enshi Prefecture, Hubei Province, have generally begun using iron and wooden tea-rolling machines this year. Tea farmers in Hefeng County, the largest tea producer in the region, have already purchased more than thirty wooden tea-rolling machines, and tea farmers who are organized are beginning to purchase iron tea-rolling machines. The Lighthoue Agricultural Tea Cooperative in Wufeng Township, Enshi District, has six iron tea-rolling machines. Tea leaves rolled using tea-rolling machines are clean, uniform, and skillfully processed, and the quality of the tea has generally improved compared to the past. Since one tea-rolling machine can replace three to six manual tea rollers, it has initially resolved the long-standing contradiction between tea farmers' tea picking and agricultural work.

    湖北省恩施专区
    主要茶园区采用揉茶机揉茶
    湖北省恩施专区各主要茶园区，今年已普遍开始采用铁制和木制揉茶机揉茶。全区产茶最多的鹤峰县各地茶农，已经购置了三十多部木制揉茶机，在组织起来的茶农中正开始购置铁制揉茶机，恩施一区五峰乡灯塔农茶业合作社有六部铁制揉茶机。使用揉茶机揉出的茶叶干净、匀巧，茶叶的品质也较过去普遍提高。由于一部揉茶机能抵上三个到六个人工揉茶，初步解决了长时期来茶农采茶和农作的矛盾。
