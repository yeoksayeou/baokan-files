Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The United States authorities are impatiently assembling a Southeast Asia aggression bloc. According to Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Garcia on July 30th, the United States has decided to convene a meeting of its allies in Baguio, Philippines, on September 6th to discuss the establishment of the Southeast Asia group. Garcia's revelation was confirmed the next day by U.S. State Department officials.

Currently, the United States is vigorously coercing its allies to take swift action. According to a Reuters report on July 31st, the United States is "conducting a series of discussions on the form of the (Southeast Asia) pact" with relevant countries, and Washington hopes that these discussions "will make great progress in the coming weeks" in order to lay the foundation for the official meeting to be held in early September. According to an Associated Press report on the same day, as the first step in the current effort, the United States is urging "the capitals of the cooperating countries to issue a series of statements within a week, stating their intention to conclude an alliance and announcing the plan to hold this meeting."

While the U.S. authorities are stepping up behind-the-scenes activities, official leading figures are coming forward to call for the speedy establishment of the Southeast Asia group. After Eisenhower and Dulles, U.S. Under Secretary of State Smith repeated the same argument in a television broadcast on August 1st, believing that after the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, "developing a Southeast Asia collective security organization has particularly urgent significance." He pointed out that this group should include "as many" countries "as possible."

According to the initial U.S. plan, the first batch of member states of the Southeast Asia group would include the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, the Philippines and other seven countries. At the same time, the United States is also making every effort to pull Asian countries participating in the Colombo Conference into this group, in order to create an Asian opposition group, so that the United States can use Asians to fight Asians.

The U.S. authorities are also actively plotting to openly undermine the provisions of the Indochina armistice agreement signed at the Geneva Conference, which stipulate that the three Indochinese countries shall not participate in any military bloc, and to pull Cambodia, Laos, and Bao Dai Vietnam into this group. Dulles had already revealed this intention in his speech on July 23rd. Now the U.S. State Department is stepping up its search for excuses to realize this conspiracy. According to a United Press International report, experts at the U.S. State Department are still continuing to "study the terms of the Indochina ceasefire agreement to determine whether Cambodia, Laos, and Free Vietnam (i.e., Bao Dai Vietnam) can participate in this (Southeast Asia) pact." Dulles even revealed his attempt to violate the Indochina armistice agreement and unilaterally declare Laos, Cambodia, and Bao Dai Vietnam as areas "protected" by the Southeast Asia aggression group, which are actually areas where the United States can carry out aggression and war activities.

However, the U.S. effort to assemble the Southeast Asia group is not going smoothly. Asian countries with self-respect and pursuing an independent foreign policy are obviously unwilling to fall into the trap set by the United States. A Washington dispatch from the International News Service on July 31st pointed out that the U.S. plan to establish a Southeast Asia group is proceeding "very poorly." According to the U.S. Information Service, even Smith himself, while touting the "importance" of this group, could not help but see that "bringing Southeast Asian countries together is a difficult task." U.S. news agencies in their reports particularly emphasized the "cold" reaction of several Colombo Conference countries to this U.S. plot. A dispatch from the International News Service pointed out that among the Southeast Asian countries that the United States originally hoped to win over, Pakistan is "the only country that has expressed enthusiasm" for the U.S. plan.

### 美国当局加紧活动拼凑东南亚侵略集团

    美国当局加紧活动拼凑东南亚侵略集团
   【新华社三日讯】美国当局正在迫不及待地拼凑东南亚侵略集团。据菲律宾副总统兼外交部长加西亚七月三十日透露，美国已决定在九月六日在菲律宾的碧瑶召集它的盟国举行讨论成立东南亚集团问题的会议。加西亚的透露，第二天就由美国国务院官员予以证实。
    目前，美国正在大力胁迫其盟国采取迅速的行动。据路透社七月三十一日报道，美国正在和有关各国“进行着一系列的关于（东南亚）公约形式的讨论”，华盛顿希望这些讨论“在今后几星期内能大有进展”，以便为九月初举行的正式会议打下基础。据同一天的美联社消息，作为当前的第一个步骤，美国正促使“各合作国家的首都在一星期内发表一连串声明，陈述它们要缔结一个联盟的意图和宣布要举行这个会议的计划”。
    美国当局在加紧幕后活动的同时，又由官方首脑人物出面叫喊要赶快成立东南亚集团。美国副国务卿史密斯继艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之后，在八月一日发表的电视广播中重复同样的论调，他认为，在日内瓦会议就恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议以后，“发展东南亚集体安全组织有特别紧急的意义”。他指出，这个集团应该包括“尽可能多”的国家。
    根据美国的初步计划，东南亚集团的第一批成员国将包括美、英、法、澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国、菲律宾等七国。美国同时还在竭力活动企图把参加科伦坡会议的亚洲国家也拉进这个集团，来制造亚洲的对立集团，以便美国用亚洲人打亚洲人。
    美国当局还在积极策划，准备公开破坏日内瓦会议上签订的规定印度支那三国不得参加任何军事集团的印度支那停战协定的条款，把柬埔寨、老挝和保大越南拉进这一集团。杜勒斯在七月二十三日的谈话中已经透露了这种意图，现在，美国国务院正在加紧找寻借口来实现这一阴谋。合众社消息说，美国国务院的专家们仍在继续“研究印度支那停火协定的条款，以判明柬埔寨、老挝和自由越南（即保大越南）是否能够参加这个（东南亚）公约”。杜勒斯甚至透露他企图违反印度支那停战协定，片面宣布老挝、柬埔寨、保大越南为受东南亚侵略集团“保护”的地区，其实就是美国可以进行侵略和战争活动的地区。
    但是，美国拼凑东南亚集团的工作并不是一帆风顺的。有自尊心的、奉行独立自主的外交政策的亚洲国家，显然不愿意钻进美国所布置的圈套。国际新闻社华盛顿七月三十一日电指出，美国要建立东南亚集团的计划进行得“很不顺利”。据美国新闻处消息，甚至史密斯本人在鼓吹这一集团的“重要性”时，也不能不看到“要把东南亚国家拉在一起是一件困难的工作”。美国通讯社在报道中特别强调若干科伦坡会议国家对于美国这一策划的“冷淡”反应。国际新闻社消息指出，在美国原先希望拉拢的东南亚国家中，巴基斯坦是对美国计划“表示热心的唯一国家”。
