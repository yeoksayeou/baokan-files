　　The US Aircraft Provocation is a Manifestation of the US Policy of Obstructing the Relaxation of International Tensions
　　Xinhua News Agency Commentator Jiang Nan
　　Following the US naval aircraft’s invasion of our country's airspace, shooting down two of our aircraft and attacking our ships, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu issued a statement lodging the most serious protest with the US government, and at the same time sternly rejected the US government's absurd "protest" that reversed black and white and attempted to deceive the public. The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely oppose the US’s frantic provocations and their steadfast position in defending our territorial airspace from invasion, which has received sympathy and support from fair-minded public opinion in various countries. Despite the best efforts of the US invaders to quibble, they have still aroused the indignation and condemnation of world public opinion and people from various countries.
　　The US authorities have clearly also seen that the consequences of this pre-planned act of aggression are not pleasant. The lies and fabrications used by the US to shirk responsibility have been exposed by the public opinion of various countries, and the truth of this provocative incident can no longer be concealed. The US ruling clique is therefore utterly embarrassed and infuriated, deliberately feigning "anger" at our country's rejection of the US government's so-called "protest" after committing acts of aggression and trying to exonerate itself with the most despicable lies. One of the reasons for this approach by the US official is that its true face as an international criminal has been revealed, and it needs to cover up its embarrassing situation.
　　Of course, the US schemers are far from giving up their intention to expand the incident and intensify the incitement of tense atmosphere. A US State Department spokesman has publicly stated that "the matter cannot be left like this." Indeed, all honest people believe that the US's responsibility has not been concluded. The US authorities should immediately abandon their conspiracy to act recklessly and wantonly aggress internationally, honestly admit their crimes, and bear all responsibility for compensating for losses and punishing the perpetrators. However, the US ruling clique is not prepared to act in accordance with human conscience and justice; what it is planning is a completely different set of tricks. White House spokesman White said on July 30 that the State Department is "actively planning" the next "action." According to US news agency reports, this is to prepare to submit another "tough protest" to China and consider "taking action within the United Nations." In other words, to continue to slander China, continue to deny, continue to portray robbers and murderers as "victims," and use the United Nations to continue peddling its fallacies such as it has "the right" to invade China's territorial waters and airspace to protect American "interests."
　　The US government is prepared to do this with a set purpose. Everyone knows that after the Geneva Conference reached an agreement and Indochina restored peace, the international situation eased, and the victory of peaceful consultation made it possible for international relations to return to normal. The US authorities believe that this is a fatal blow to its "policy of strength," and therefore, they spare no effort to resist this situation. As soon as the Geneva Conference agreement was signed, the US expressed its desire to sign a military treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, to step up the organization of a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, and to hold talks in Washington with Syngman Rhee to plot new conspiracies. All this shows that the US wants to further pursue its policy of hostility towards China, aggression against China, threatening the peace and security of Asia, and deepening international tensions. The provocative incident of US aircraft invading our airspace and shooting down our aircraft is the latest manifestation of this policy. Now, after the provocation has failed and the conspiracy has been exposed, the US is still trying to incite a tense atmosphere, distort right and wrong, and make trouble unreasonably, in order to take the opportunity to recoup something.
　　However, the facts cannot be denied. The United Press International straightforwardly admitted that "the United States hopes to receive important diplomatic benefits from this conflict" (referring to the US aircraft invading our airspace and shooting down our aircraft). The UPI pointed out that the US can take this opportunity to "refute the Communists' argument that East and West can coexist peacefully after the Indochina agreement" and give the US "more powerful" reasons to oppose restoring China's legitimate status in the United Nations. This provides yet another proof that the US deliberately created this aggressive and provocative incident in order to obstruct the widespread establishment of the principle of peaceful coexistence and obstruct the normalization of international relations.

    美机挑衅事件是美国阻挠国际局势缓和的政策的表现
    新华社评论员　江南
    在美国海军飞机侵犯我国领空，击落我国飞机两架并袭击我国船舰的挑衅事件发生以后，我外交部副部长章汉夫发表声明，对美国政府提出最严重的抗议，同时严正地拒绝了美国政府颠倒黑白、蒙混视听的荒谬“抗议”。中国政府和中国人民坚决反对美国的疯狂挑衅和维护领土领空不受侵犯的严正立场，受到各国公正舆论的同情和支持，美国侵犯者尽管竭力狡赖，仍然引起了世界舆论和各国人士的愤慨和谴责。
    美国当局显然也看到了：这一预先规划的侵略行为所引起的后果并不美妙，美国用来推卸责任的撒谎和捏造，已被各国舆论所拆穿，这一挑衅事件的真相已经再也不能加以掩饰。美国统治集团因此老羞成怒，对我国拒绝美国政府在犯下了侵略暴行之后用最卑鄙的谎话来开脱自己的所谓“抗议”，故意装腔作势地表示“愤怒”。美国官方的这种作法，原因之一就是：它的国际罪犯的真面目被揭露了，需要掩盖自己的狼狈处境。
    当然，美国阴谋者还远没有就此收拾起他的扩大事端、加紧煽动紧张空气的打算。美国国务院发言人已经公开表示，“事情不能就这样算了。”不错，一切正直的人们都认为：美国的责任还没有了结。美国当局应该立即放弃它的在国际间胡作非为、肆意侵略的阴谋，老老实实地承认罪行，并承担赔偿损失、惩办凶犯的一切责任。但是，美国统治集团却不准备按照人类的良知和正义来办事，它所策划的恰好是另一套完全不同的勾当。白宫发言人怀特七月三十日说，国务院正“积极策划”下一“行动”，根据美国通讯社报道，这就是准备再次向中国提出“强硬抗议”，并考虑“在联合国内采取行动”。也就是说，要继续诬蔑中国，继续抵赖，继续把强盗、凶手说成“被害者”，并利用联合国来继续贩卖它的“有权”侵犯中国领海、领空来保卫美国“利益”之类的谬论。
    美国政府准备这样做有它既定的目的。谁都知道，日内瓦会议达成协议、印度支那恢复和平以后，国际局势有了缓和，和平协商的胜利使国际关系有恢复正常的可能，美国当局认为这是它的“实力政策”的致命伤，因此，就不惜用一切办法来抗拒这种形势。日内瓦会议的协议刚刚签字，美国就表示想和蒋介石匪帮签订军事条约，要加紧组织东南亚侵略集团，并且在华盛顿和李承晚举行策划新阴谋的会谈。这一切都说明美国要进一步推行其敌视中国、侵略中国、威胁亚洲的和平与安全、加深国际紧张局势的政策。美机侵入我领空、击落我机的挑衅事件正是这种政策的最新的表现。现在，在挑衅失败、阴谋揭穿之后，美国仍然企图煽动紧张空气，颠倒是非，无理取闹，以便乘机捞回一把。
    但是，事实是无法否认的。美国合众社就直截了当地承认，“美国希望从这次冲突（按指美机侵入我国领空、击落我机事件）中收到重要的外交利益”。合众社指出，美国将可以乘此“驳倒共产党人提出的在印度支那协议后，东西方有可能和平共处的说法”，并使美国可以有“更有力的”理由来反对恢复中国在联合国的合法地位。这就为美国蓄意制造这一侵略的、挑衅的事件以阻挠和平共处原则的普遍建立、阻挠国际关系正常化，提供了又一次证明。
