Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, August 9th: The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued an urgent directive to Party committees at all levels throughout the province, requiring Party organizations throughout the province to immediately mobilize peasants to strive for an overproduction of 680 million jin of grain, 42 million jin of ginned cotton, and 22 million jin of oil crops.

The directive, based on the growth of various crops throughout the province and the possible conditions, specifically requires that six-tenths of the province's cotton fields, three-tenths of the spring millet, sorghum, and all sweet potatoes, corn, and summer-sown millet, undergo one or two more rounds of cultivation and soil improvement to increase soil temperature, prevent drought and waterlogging, and promote crop setting. It also requires all localities to apply fertilizer once more to more than 10 million mu of cotton, corn, and millet to compensate for the loss of fertilizer effectiveness due to excessive rain and to promote crop growth. The directive particularly emphasizes the management of cotton fields, and in response to the late growth of cotton seedlings, requires local leaders to have peasants top the cotton plants early to promote early maturity. In addition, it proposes important production-increasing measures such as artificial auxiliary pollination of corn, timely leaf removal from sorghum, timely prevention and control of autumn locusts and red spider mites, emergency planting of 2 million mu of late-season crops in waterlogged areas, and careful harvesting and threshing during the autumn harvest.

The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out in its directive that carrying out the overproduction movement is an arduous and urgent political task, and Party organizations in rural areas throughout the province must go all out. Leading cadres at all levels must go deep into key areas, with the Party's rural branches as the core, give full play to the leading role of nearly two million Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, and mobilize more than 30,000 agricultural production cooperatives and hundreds of thousands of mutual aid teams to lead peasants throughout the province to calculate production increases, tap potential, formulate plans, and promote the rapid development of the movement.

    河北动员农民超额增产粮食、棉花、油料
    【新华社保定九日电】中共河北省委员会在最近向全省各级党委发出紧急指示，要求全省党组织立即动员农民争取超额增产六亿八千万斤粮食、四千二百万斤皮棉和两千二百万斤油料。
    指示根据全省各种农作物的生长情况和可能条件，具体要求全省十分之六的棉田、十分之三的春谷、高粱和全部的薯类、玉米、夏播谷子，再多中耕培土一两遍，以增加地温，预防旱涝伏倒，促进作物结实。还要求各地对一千多万亩棉花、玉米和谷子，再增追一次肥料，以弥补雨多肥效流失，促进作物生长。指示特别强调棉田的管理，针对棉苗成长较晚的情况，要求各地领导农民早打棉尖，促使棉花早熟。此外，并提出玉米人工辅助授粉、高粱及时打叶，及时防除秋蝗、火蜘蛛等虫害，内涝地区抢种二百万亩晚田和秋收当中精收细打等重要增产措施。
    中共河北省委在指示中指出，开展超额增产运动是一项艰巨紧迫的政治任务，全省农村党组织必须全力以赴。各级负责干部要深入重点，以党的农村支部为核心，充分发挥近二百万共产党员和青年团员的领导作用，发动三万多个农业生产合作社、几十万个互助组带动全省农民算增产账、挖潜力、订计划，推动运动迅速开展。
