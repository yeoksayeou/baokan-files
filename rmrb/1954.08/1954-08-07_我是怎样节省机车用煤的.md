How I Saved Coal for Locomotives
Li Shaoqiang, Locomotive Driver Foreman, Changchun Locomotive Depot, Harbin Railway Bureau

In July 1951, I was promoted to locomotive driver. At that time, I only felt that my responsibilities were heavy. I only knew that I should not have accidents at work, and that I should study hard and improve my technical level. I didn't think about how to accumulate more wealth for the country.

In the first quarter of 1952, when we were drafting the production increase and conservation plan, we found that coal consumption accounted for 79 percent of the total expenditure of our transportation workshop. This shocked me. From then on, I realized that in order to comprehensively complete the transportation tasks, we must strive to reduce transportation costs; and to reduce costs and complete the production increase and conservation plan, we must start with saving coal.

I am a member of the Communist Youth League and a locomotive driver. Saving coal is my responsibility, but I couldn't think of a way to realize this wish.

At this time, the leadership called on us to learn from advanced experience, which pointed out the direction for my efforts; at the same time, Zheng Xikun's operating method was also promoted to the Changchun Locomotive Depot. I heard that this was a revolution in driver operation, so I participated in the study and determined to master this new operating method. However, the initial application of Zheng Xikun's operating method was not very smooth. The first time I tried "open the throttle wide and raise the handle high," I was not only late, but also used more coal and couldn't generate enough steam. But I was not discouraged. I thought, Zheng Xikun's operating method is the result of the specific application of Soviet advanced experience in our country. Others can run faster than the axle load, why can't I? There must be something wrong with my actions. After work, I went to consult with the guiding driver Yang Shouyuan. Based on my specific situation, he told me how to raise the handle, how to prevent the train from being late, and how to prevent the train from shaking. According to this method, we overcame the problems of being late and exerting effort in the next shift's test. From then on, we could not only arrive on time, but also pull trains exceeding the axle load. However, how to save more locomotive coal was still an unresolved problem.

One day, when it was my turn to work, the comrade on duty told me that it was a single locomotive (only one locomotive) going to Siping to haul empty cars (empty train). Han Yuxi, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, learned about this and called me over to say: "Comrade Li Shaoqiang, the biggest problem in our depot at present is the waste of coal by single locomotives and empty cars. If we can find a way to save coal in these two areas, the overall coal consumption will be reduced. You are using a single locomotive to haul empty cars today. How much coal do you plan to save?" I was stumped by his question and only managed to say a few words: "I'm afraid it's going to be tough!" "It's difficult!" Secretary Han said: "However, it is also a glorious task." At that time, I accepted this task. On the way back, I walked and thought, this is a difficult problem, but it is also an aspect of saving locomotive coal. If I could really figure out a way, wouldn't I be able to save a lot of coal? I also thought: If the single locomotive runs in reverse, wouldn't it save coal by not having to turn around when returning! Empty trains can also use the prescribed maximum speed and raise the handle as high as possible. After returning, I told the deputy driver Shao Yongfa and the fireman Wang Zhaoxiang about the task given by the Communist Youth League branch and my own ideas. The three of us combined our own work and the advanced experience we had learned to study how to cooperate. Everyone guaranteed not to waste a bit of steam and not to throw an extra shovel of coal. As a result, this trip saved 560 kilograms of converted coal, which made us realize that single locomotives and empty cars are not unable to save coal. At this time, the Party and the League gave me great encouragement, asking me to further study and learn various advanced experiences. After the enlightenment of the Party and the League, I synthesized the advantages of various advanced experiences and found the key to saving coal in each process. For example, in the preparation for leaving the depot, in the past, we did it without a plan, which resulted in wasting coal in the depot. After this synthesis, we found four key points in the preparation for leaving the depot. As a result, we saved 17 kilograms of coal even when hauling 102 empty cars.

However, at that time, our working method was not complete. After the summary and theoretical analysis by the technical personnel, especially with the assistance of the depot's thermal engineers Liu Jiazhen and Ji Yunlong, and after two experiments organized by the leadership of the Railway Bureau in 1953, a relatively complete advanced operating method for locomotive crews was summarized. This operating method can not only successfully complete various transportation indicators, but also save coal in almost any transportation situation, so it is also called the coal-saving operating method.

The success of this operating method is inseparable from the cultivation of the Party, the guidance of Soviet experts, and the help of comrades, especially the joint efforts and research of deputy driver Shao Yongfa and fireman Wang Zhaoxiang. Using this operating method, our chartered car group saved a total of 128.5 tons of converted coal in ten and a half months of 1952. In 1953, the coal used per 10,000 ton-kilometers was 23.8 percent lower than the Railway Bureau's target.

In the future, I will think of more ways and carry out technological innovations to save more wealth for the country.

    我是怎样节省机车用煤的
    哈尔滨铁路管理局长春机务段司机长　李绍强
    一九五一年七月我被提升为机车司机，那时我只感到自己的担子很重，只知道工作中不要出事故，要好好学习，提高技术水平；而没有想到应该怎样给国家积累更多的财富。
    一九五二年第一季度我们订增产节约计划时，发现煤的消耗占我们运输车间总支出的百分之七十九。这使我大吃一惊，从此认识到了：为了全面完成运输任务，必须努力降低运输成本；而要降低成本完成增产节约计划，必须从节约用煤入手。
    我是个青年团员，又是一名机车司机，节约用煤是我的责任，可是我想不出用什么办法来实现这个愿望。
    这时，领导上号召我们学习先进经验，给我指出了努力的方向；同时郑锡坤操纵法也推广到长春机务段来了。我听说这是司机操纵上的革命，就参加了学习，决心要掌握这个新的操纵法。但是，开始运用郑锡坤操纵法，并不是很顺利的。第一次试验“大开汽门，高提手把”时，不仅晚点，而且还多费了煤，烧不上汽。但我没有灰心，我想，郑锡坤操纵法是苏联先进经验在我国具体运用的成果，人家能超轴快跑，我为什么不能？一定是动作有毛病。下班后我就去请教指导司机杨守元，他根据我的具体情况，告诉我应该怎样提手把，怎样使车不晚点，怎样使车走起来不乱晃。按照这个办法，我们下班车一试验就克服了晚点和费劲的现象。从此不仅能正点到达，而且也能拉超轴列车了。但是，如何能更多地节约机车用煤，还是一个没有解决的问题。
    有一天，该我出勤，值班的同志告诉我是单机
  （只开一个车头）上四平拉运排空（空列车）。青年团总支书记韩玉玺知道了这个消息，便打电话把我找去，对我说：“李绍强同志，我们段上当前最大的问题是单机和排空费煤，如果在这两项上能找到省煤的办法，整个煤耗就会减少，你今天是单机接运排空，你打算省多少煤？”我被他问住了，只说出几个字：“怕够呛吧！”“难是难啊！”韩书记说：“不过，也是个光荣的任务。”当时，我接受了这个任务。在回来的路上，我一面走，一面想，这是个难题，可是，这也是节省机车用煤的一个方面，真能琢磨点办法出来，不就可以省许多煤吗？我又想：如果单机倒着开，省得回来时掉头不就省了煤啦！拉空车也可以用规定的最高速度和尽量高提手把的办法。回去之后，我把团总支给的任务和自己的想法告诉了副司机邵永发和司炉王兆祥，三个人就结合自己的业务和所学的先进经验研究如何配合，每人都提出保证不浪费一点汽，不多投一锹煤。结果这一趟车节省了换算煤五百六十公斤，使我们认识到单机和空车不是不能省煤的。这时党和团给我很大的鼓励，要我进一步钻研，学习各种先进经验。经过党和团的启发，我综合了各种先进经验的优点，找出每一工序上的省煤关键。例如出库准备，过去是没有计划的干，结果在库内就费了煤，经过这一综合，找到了出库准备中的四个关键，结果牵引一百零二辆空车也省煤十七公斤。
    但是当时我们的工作方法还不完整，经过技术人员的总结和理论上的分析，特别是段上热力技术员刘家振、季云龙二位同志的协助总结，一九五三年管理局领导上又组织了两次试验，才总结出一套比较完整的机车乘务组先进操作法。这种操纵法不但可以良好地完成各项运输指标，而且几乎在任何运输情况中都能做到省煤，因此又叫做省煤操纵法。
    这个操纵法的成功是和党的培养，苏联专家的指导，以及同志们的帮助分不开的，特别是和副司机邵永发、司炉王兆祥的共同努力钻研分不开的。运用这个操纵法，我们的包车组在一九五二年的十个半月中，共节约换算煤一百二十八点五吨。一九五三年每万吨公里中用的煤比管理局指标降低了百分之二十三点八。
    今后我还要更多的想办法，进行技术革新，为国家节约更多的财富。
