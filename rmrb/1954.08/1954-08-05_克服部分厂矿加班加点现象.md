    Overcoming the Phenomenon of Overtime Work in Some Factories and Mines

    The Zhejiang Daily published a news item on June 29th stating that the phenomenon of overtime work in the state-owned Ningbo Iron Factory was very serious. From January to May of this year, the total overtime hours reached 5,147. Almost every Sunday, many workers worked overtime. As for workers routinely increasing their working hours by one or two hours a day, this was even more common. As the workers in the factory reflected: "Although the quantity of diesel engines (the factory's product) has been achieved, the component of using brains is small, and the component of relying on physical strength is large."

    Like the Ningbo Iron Factory, there are currently some factories and mines that use overtime to complete the state plan, and this is not an isolated case. The leading cadres of these factories and mines have unclear ideas about relying on the working class to improve production. They believe that: "The 'measure' of overtime work will take effect immediately." However, the facts of the Ningbo Iron Factory once again prove that this method is extremely wrong.

    As a result of the factory implementing overtime to catch up with the plan, although the production plan targets were achieved, it caused the phenomena of low quality, many defective products, and high waste. In the metalworking workshop alone, the man-hours lost due to the scrapping of processed parts from January to May of this year were 4,973.7, which is almost the same as the overtime hours of the entire factory during the same period. At the same time, it has also brought serious consequences to the health of workers. Among the patients in the factory in May, 10% were sick due to overwork. There were also many work-related injuries. In May, a work-related injury occurred on average about once every three days, and there were 68 workdays of absence due to work-related injuries.

    Simply increasing labor intensity to complete the production plan is a method adopted by capitalist countries. This method is incompatible with the socialist nature of our enterprises and is also not permitted by our laws. The Ningbo Iron Factory, as well as state-owned and local state-owned enterprises similar to the Ningbo Iron Factory, must continuously improve the level of business management, rely on employees to carry out creative labor, and on this basis, comprehensively complete the state plan. At present, it is even more important to lead the masses of employees to carry out labor competitions and rationalization proposals movements in a led, planned, and targeted manner, and on this basis, carry out technological innovation movements, overcome blindness and spontaneity, overcome weak links in production, and complete the state plan well.

### 克服部分厂矿加班加点现象

    克服部分厂矿加班加点现象
    六月二十九日的浙江日报发表一条新闻说，地方国营宁波铁工厂加班加点的现象十分严重。在今年一至五月份中，加班加点的时间共达五千一百四十七个工时。几乎每个星期日都有许多工人加班。至于平日工人们一天增加工作一、两小时的更是常见的事情。正像该厂工人们所反映的：“柴油机（该厂的产品）的数量虽然达到了，但是靠动脑筋的成分少，靠拚体力的成分多。”
    像宁波铁工厂一样以加班加点的办法来完成国家计划的厂矿，在目前并不是个别的。这些厂矿的领导干部对依靠工人阶级搞好生产的思想不明确。他们认为：“加班加点的‘措施’下去，马上就见效。”但是，宁波铁工厂的事实再一次证明这种办法是极端错误的。
    这个厂实行加班加点赶计划的结果，虽然达到了产量计划指标，但却造成了质量低、废品多、浪费高的现象，仅该厂金工车间今年一至五月份因加工零件报废所损失的工时，就有四千九百七十三点七个，差不多与同时间内全厂加班加点的工时一样多。同时，也给工人的健康带来了严重的恶果，该厂五月份的病人中，就有百分之十是因疲劳过度而生病。工伤事故也很多，五月份平均约三天就发生一次工伤事故，因工伤而缺勤有六十八个工作日。
    单纯以加强劳动强度来完成生产计划是资本主义国家所采取的办法。这个办法是与我们企业的社会主义性质不相容的，也是我国的法律所不能容许的。宁波铁工厂以及与宁波铁工厂相似的国营与地方国营企业，必须不断地提高企业的经营管理水平，依靠职工进行创造性的劳动，在此基础上来全面完成国家计划。在目前，更应该有领导有计划有目标地领导职工群众开展劳动竞赛和合理化建议运动，并在这个基础上开展技术革新运动，克服盲目自流现象克服生产上的薄弱环节，很好地完成国家计划。
