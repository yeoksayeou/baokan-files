    Production and "Investigation Outline"
    He Bin
    After last year's struggle against bureaucracy, the phenomenon of "too many statistical reports" has indeed been greatly reduced in various places. But it would be naive to think that after one struggle, this phenomenon has completely disappeared. If you don't believe it, look at the facts.
    Example one: From December of last year to May of this year, Fenghua County, Zhejiang Province, issued a total of 43 kinds of forms from various county-level departments to districts and townships for completion; among these 43 kinds of forms, 20 were issued by the departments themselves without the approval of provincial and county leading organs. Just to investigate the issue of draught cattle, the Agricultural and Forestry Section of the County People's Government issued four kinds of forms: "Comparative Table of Draught Cattle by Gender," "Statistical Table of Draught Cattle Growth and Decline Over the Years," "Comparative Table of Cattle Raising by Various Classes in Rural Areas Over the Years," and "Statistical Table of Draught Cattle by Age." When filling out the forms, it was not only necessary to distinguish between "pre-War of Resistance, the period of enemy and puppet regime, the year of the victory of the War of Resistance, the year of Liberation, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, and 1954," but also to distinguish between "landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, poor peasants, and farm laborers," to distinguish between "rented and owned," and to report draught cattle "separately from one to fifteen years old" one by one.
    Example two: In April of this year, the Guangyuan Central County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Sichuan Province, according to the instructions of the Mianyang Prefectural Committee, drafted an "Investigation Outline on How to Improve Production in Mountainous Areas" and issued it to Qingchuan, Zhaohua, Wangcang and other counties under its jurisdiction. This outline was divided into five aspects and twenty-six major items, including fifty or sixty questions. The content ranged from politics to economics, from history to the present situation, from above ground to underground, from general to typical, from problems to solutions... everything was included. In the investigation of the general situation of mountainous areas, in addition to requiring statistics on the area of cultivated land in mountains and plains, the area of mountains exceeding 45 degrees that are not suitable for farming, the area of barren mountains, pastoral areas and forest mountains, the types and quantities of major agricultural products, special products and livestock, and the detailed methods of leading the masses to prevent and control hail, wind, flood, insects, drought, floods, diseases and beasts over the years, it is also necessary to count the "types" and "quantities" of trees on the forest mountains, whether there are economic forests, how much area, and how much of each type and quantity. After counting the trees on the ground, it is also necessary to count what major "minerals" are underground and how large the reserves are. For the investigation of the development of mutual aid and cooperation in mountainous areas, in addition to a general understanding of what forms of labor exchange the masses have historically had, how many groups, households, labor force, and livestock have been organized now, and the characteristics, existing problems and solutions in implementing the three major principles of equal value and mutual benefit, democratic management, etc., a special outline for investigating the situation of mutual aid groups is also attached. Regarding strengthening the leadership of economic work in mountainous areas, in addition to a general survey of the general commercial situation, it is also necessary to attach a typical investigation of one or two primary markets and a typical investigation of the handicraft production situation. Regarding how to strengthen the leadership of mountainous areas in the future, the outline requires "formulating a practical and feasible work plan for transforming mountainous areas, as well as practical implementation methods."
    It is of course possible to conduct in-depth and detailed investigations to improve production in mountainous areas, but the problem is that with such an "outline," it is not optimistic whether the task can be completed in the short term even if special personnel are sent to investigate. However, the Guangyuan Central County Committee seemed to have forgotten that it was the busy season of spring ploughing and production when it issued this outline, and it also seemed that it had not considered the cadre situation in each county. Therefore, it actually required each county committee to "assign special personnel and relevant departments to collect relevant detailed materials, sort them out and attach typical investigation materials, and send a copy each to the prefectural committee and the central county committee before May 20."
    Indeed, it is difficult to fill out such "statistical tables," "comparative tables" and "investigation outlines" seriously. Therefore, two methods were adopted in actual work (of course, these two methods are also not worth learning from). One is to replace "statistics" with "estimation," and the other is to make "production" subordinate to "the outline." Isn't that right? Despite the fact that these investigation forms were so "detailed" and "thorough," in the hands of the township head and clerk of Huta Township in Fenghua County, they easily filled out six kinds of forms with just a pen and an abacus in less than an hour. After receiving the investigation outline sent by the Guangyuan Central County Committee on April 24, the Qingchuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted another method. Regardless of the fact that it was the busy season for spring ploughing and sowing, they immediately transferred all nine cadres leading spring ploughing production in the countryside back on the 26th, and also drew eight cadres from other departments in the county, a total of seventeen people, and formed three investigation teams. They first studied the outline in the county for two days, and then went to the countryside to investigate separately. Because the materials had to be sent to the prefectural committee and the central county committee before May 20, the actual working time of the investigation team was only ten days. In just ten days, it would be easy to count the types and quantities of trees on the forest mountains within a radius of twenty or thirty miles of the whole county, and to investigate the minerals buried underground? What's more, there is not a single geologist in Qingchuan County! Therefore, although the county committee instructed to conduct the investigation "in conjunction" with leading production, the cadres in charge of the investigation were afraid that they would not be able to complete the task even if they went all out, so they had to let the outline overwhelm production.
    The intention of those who formulate and issue such forms and outlines may be to improve leadership and increase production. Look, doesn't the investigation outline clearly state "improve production in mountainous areas"! However, "forms" and "outlines" with "complex content, all kinds of strange things, too high requirements, and too tight time limits" can never achieve this goal. The facts are exactly like this. The result of using "estimation" instead of "statistics" is false reports, and isn't it dangerous to lead based on false reports! Making "production" subordinate to "the outline" directly hinders production, let alone increasing production. Cold and merciless facts are once again sounding the alarm for our comrades who are enthusiastic about forms and outlines: The phenomenon of indiscriminate issuance of reports must stop!

    生产和“调查提纲”
    何彬
    经过去年反官僚主义的斗争，各地“统计表报多”的现象确实大为减少。但是如果有人认为经过一次斗争，这种现象已经从此绝迹，那就未免想得太天真了。假如不信，请看事实。
    例子之一：浙江奉化县从去年十二月到今年五月，由县级各部门发到区、乡填报的表格共有四十三种；这四十三种表格内，未经省、县领导机关批准而由各部门自行发下的就有二十种。单是调查耕牛问题，县人民政府农林科就发了“耕牛性别比较表”、“历年耕牛消长统计表”、“农村各阶级历年养牛比较表”、“耕牛年龄统计表”等四种表格。填写时不但要分“抗战前、敌伪时期、抗日胜利年、解放年、一九五○年、一九五一年、一九五二年、一九五三年、一九五四年”，还要分“地主、富农、中农、贫农、雇农”，要分“租入、自有”，而且要将耕牛“分别一岁到十五岁”逐一填报。
    例子之二：今年四月，中共四川省广元中心县委根据绵阳地委指示拟制了一个“关于如何改进山区生产的调查提纲”，发到所属青川、昭化、旺苍等县。这个提纲分五方面、二十六大项，包括五、六十个问题。内容从政治到经济，从历史到现状，从地上到地下，从一般到典型，从问题到解决办法……应有尽有。在调查山区的一般情况方面，提纲除了要求统计山地、平坝的耕地面积，山地中超过四十五度不宜农耕的面积，荒山、宜牧地区和林山的面积，主要农产品、特产品和牲畜的种类、数量，以及数年来领导群众防治雹、风、涝、虫、旱、洪、病、兽等灾害的详细办法之外，还要统计林山上树木的“种类”和“数量”，有无经济林木、面积多少、种类和数量各多少。统计了地面上的林木，还要统计地底下有些什么主要“矿产”，储藏量多大。对于山区互助合作发展情况的调查，除了一般的了解历史上群众有那些换工形式，现在组织起来的组数、户数、劳力、畜力各有多少，以及贯彻等价互利、民主管理等三大原则方面的特点、存在问题和解决办法等等之外，还附有一个专门调查互助组情况的提纲。关于加强对山区经济工作的领导方面，除了作一般商业情况的普查外，还要附上一两个初级市场的典型调查和一个手工业生产情况的典型调查。对于今后如何加强山区领导，提纲上要求“订出切实可行的改造山区的工作方案，以及切实贯彻的办法”。
    为了改进山区生产而进行深入细致的调查当然是可以的，问题在于像这样的“提纲”，即使派出专人调查，在短期内能否完成任务也未可乐观。但是广元中心县委在发出这个提纲时，却好像忘记了当时正是春耕生产紧张时期，也似乎没有考虑各县的干部情况。因此，竟要求各县委“责成专人及有关各部门分工搜集有关详细材料，整理并附上典型调查材料，于五月二十日前送地委及中心县委各一份”。
    的确，要认真地填写这样的“统计表”、“比较表”和“调查提纲”，是困难的。于是在实际工作中就采取了两种办法（当然，这两种办法也是不足为训的）。一种是用“估计”代替“统计”，另一种是拿“生产”来服从“提纲”。不是吗，尽管这些调查表格是那么“详尽”“周到”，在奉化县葫塔乡乡长和文书的手里，竟凭着一支笔和一个算盘，不出一个钟头，就轻而易举地将六种表格填写好了。中共青川县委在四月二十四日接到广元中心县委发来的调查提纲后，采取了另一种办法。他们不顾当时正是春耕播种的紧张时期，立即把在农村中领导春耕生产的九个干部于二十六日全部调回，还从县里别的部门抽出八个干部，一共十七个人，组成了三个调查组，先在县里对提纲进行了两天的学习，然后分头下乡去调查。因为材料要在五月二十日前送到地委和中心县委，调查组实际工作的时间只有十几天。在短短的十几天里，要把全县方圆二、三十里林山上树木的种类和数量也统计出来，把埋藏在地底下的矿产也调查清楚，岂是易事？何况青川全县并无一个地质工作者！因此，虽说县委指示要“结合”领导生产进行调查，但调查的干部全力以赴还怕完不成任务，就只好让提纲来压倒生产了。
    制发诸如此类的表格和提纲的人们，其用心也许是为了改进领导、提高生产。请看，那调查提纲上不是明明写着“改进山区生产”！但是“内容复杂，无奇不有，要求太高，时限太急”的“表格”
  “提纲”，却绝不能达到这个目的。事实也正是如此。用“估计”代替“统计”的结果，就是假报告，凭着假报告来进行领导岂不危险！拿“生产”来服从“提纲”就直接妨碍了生产，更不用说提高生产了。冷酷无情的事实，再一次向我们热中于表格、提纲的同志们敲起了警钟：滥发表报的现象必须休止！
