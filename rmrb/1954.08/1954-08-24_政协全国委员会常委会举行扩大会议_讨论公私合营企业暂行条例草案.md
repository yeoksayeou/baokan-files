Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: The 59th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was held in an enlarged session on the 23rd, presided over by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. The meeting discussed the "Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises (Draft)," which will soon be submitted to the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee for review and approval. Prior to this, the participants had held two group discussions on the regulations (draft).

At the meeting, Sun Qimeng, Deputy Director of the Sixth Office of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, explained the drafting process of the regulations (draft) and the main policy issues in the regulations (draft). The following then spoke: Sheng Pihua, Jiang Guangnai, Sha Qianli, Zhang Bojun, Hou Debang, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Chen Jingshu, Liu Guojun, Zhu Jisheng, Li Zhuchen, Hu Ziang, and others. They represented the democratic parties and people's organizations related to industry and commerce, the responsible business departments of joint state-private enterprises, and industrialists holding responsible positions in joint state-private enterprises. From different perspectives, they unanimously agreed that these regulations summarized the experiences of the state in carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce over the past few years, and are in line with the general task of the state during the transition period and the current actual situation in various regions, thus they are appropriate and timely. They unanimously advocated that these regulations (draft) be submitted to the State Council for review and promulgation as soon as possible for implementation. In their speeches, they also cited many specific and powerful facts to illustrate that in joint state-private industrial enterprises, due to the cooperation of socialist elements with capitalist elements within the enterprise and the leading position of the socialist elements, the relations of production in the enterprise have undergone important changes, becoming semi-socialist enterprises with advantages that cannot be compared with the intermediate form of state capitalism, especially general private capitalist enterprises. They believed that the leading position and role of socialist elements in joint state-private enterprises play an important role in the transformation of capitalist enterprises and the transformation of capitalists themselves. Joint state-private ownership is an important form that facilitates the dual transformation of enterprises and capitalists. As long as private industrialists and businessmen sincerely accept socialist transformation, individuals also have a bright future.

In the group discussions and plenary speeches, the participants put forward a number of suggestions for revision and supplementation of the regulations (draft) on individual specific issues.

Finally, Li Weihan, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, made explanations and answers to the regulations (draft) and the questions raised by everyone in the group discussions and plenary speeches.

The attendees and participants in this meeting included: members of the Standing Committee and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, members of the Central People's Government Committee, members of the Government Affairs Council of the State Council, representatives of the consultation committees of Guangxi, Hubei, Henan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Fujian, Shandong, Sichuan, Hebei, Shaanxi and other provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, representatives of the consultation committees of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Harbin, Xi'an and other cities, representatives of local organizations of democratic parties and people from industry and commerce, representatives of trade unions of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Qingdao, Lushun-Dalian, Shenyang and other cities, specially invited people from Southwest, Northwest and other large regions, and representatives of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, totaling more than 200 people.

    政协全国委员会常委会举行扩大会议
    讨论公私合营企业暂行条例草案
    【新华社二十三日讯】　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会第五十九次会议在二十三日举行扩大会议，由副主席陈叔通主持。会议对中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会即将提请政务院审核通过的“公私合营工业企业暂行条例（草案）”进行了讨论。在这之前，参加会议的人员曾两次分组讨论了这个条例（草案）。
    会上，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会第六办公厅副主任孙起孟对这一条例（草案）的起草过程和条例（草案）中主要的政策问题作了说明。接着发言的，有：盛丕华、蒋光鼐、沙千里、章伯钧、侯德榜、黄炎培、陈叔通、陈经畬、刘国钧、朱继圣、李烛尘、胡子昂等。他们代表着与工商界有关的民主党派和人民团体、公私合营企业的主管业务部门以及在公私合营企业中担任负责职务的工业家等各个不同方面。他们从不同的角度一致认为，这个条例总结了几年来国家对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的经验，符合于国家过渡时期的总任务和各地目前的实际情况，因而是适当的，及时的。他们一致主张将这一条例（草案）迅速提请政务院审核公布，予以施行。他们在发言中还举出许多具体有力的事实，说明在公私合营工业企业中，由于社会主义成分在企业内部与资本主义成分合作并且居于领导地位，因而企业的生产关系就发生了重要的变化，成为半社会主义性质的企业，具有为国家资本主义中级形式特别是一般的私人资本主义企业所不能比拟的优越性。他们认为，在公私合营企业中，社会主义成分的领导地位和领导作用，对于资本主义企业的改造和对资本家个人的改造，有着重要作用。公私合营是便利于进行企业与资本家双重改造的重要形式，只要私营工商业者诚恳地接受社会主义改造，个人也是有光明前途的。
    参加会议的人员在小组讨论和大会发言中，对这一条例（草案）在个别具体问题上提出了若干修改和补充意见。
    会议最后由中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会副主任李维汉对这一条例（草案）和大家在小组讨论和大会发言中提出的问题作了说明和解答。
    出席和列席这次会议的有：中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员和在京委员，中央人民政府委员会委员，政务院政务委员，广西、湖北、河南、江西、安徽、江苏、福建、山东、四川、河北、陕西等省和内蒙古自治区协商委员会代表，北京、天津、上海、南京、杭州、济南、青岛、武汉、广州、重庆、沈阳、旅大、哈尔滨、西安等市协商委员会代表、民主党派地方组织代表和工商界人士，北京、天津、上海、武汉、青岛、旅大、沈阳等市工会代表，西南、西北等大区的特邀人士，中国民主建国会总会和中华全国工商业联合会的代表等共二百多人。
