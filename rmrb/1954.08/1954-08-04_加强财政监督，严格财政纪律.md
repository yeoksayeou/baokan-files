Strengthen Fiscal Supervision and Enforce Strict Financial Discipline
Jiang Mingyuan
    The "Report on the Draft National Budget for 1954," approved by the Central People's Government Committee, points out that in order to ensure the realization of the 1954 national budget, one of the tasks is to strengthen financial supervision and enforce strict financial discipline.

    The realization of the national budget depends on whether budget revenues and expenditures can be completed according to plan. This is related to the proportionate development of various national construction undertakings and the speed of our country's industrialization and the further improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards. The total income and expenditure of the 1954 national budget have increased considerably compared with last year, with the rise of the national economy and the development of national construction. However, to ensure that budget revenues can be completed in a timely and full amount, and that budget expenditures can be used reasonably and economically, so as to successfully realize this year's national budget, enterprises, institutions, state administrative organs, and financial and taxation departments must make unremitting efforts. Specifically, it is necessary to strive to increase production, tap potential, implement a strict economy system, and carry out a resolute struggle against the phenomenon of wasting state funds and violating state financial discipline. In addition to actively organizing revenue and strictly controlling expenditures, the finance department is also responsible for supervising the economic and financial activities of enterprises, institutions, and state organs. Because our financial work is not only to mobilize and allocate state budget funds, but more importantly, to check the correct implementation and completion of the national construction plan through the mobilization and allocation of funds, so as to play a supervisory role, thereby achieving the purpose of increasing income, saving expenditure, correctly implementing the financial system, and improving the level of financial management. Therefore, strengthening financial supervision is an important task to ensure the realization of the 1954 national budget and an important method to help enterprises, institutions, and administrative organs improve organizational management, implement economic accounting, and implement a strict economy system.

    In the past few years, thanks to the leadership and attention of party committees and governments at all levels, the financial management of enterprises, institutions, and state organs has made significant progress. Enterprise profits and taxes have been well collected, and the management of expenditures has also been improved year by year. However, it is undeniable that there are still many shortcomings in this regard. A relatively common problem is that some departments set their revenue plans too conservatively and do not tap enough potential. For example, after the 1953 budget was determined in Heilongjiang Province, the Provincial Department of Finance organized an inspection for more than a month, inspecting the income plans of twenty-eight local state-owned enterprises and eighteen counties and cities, as well as some county and city tax bureaus. As a result, the income increased by more than 120 billion yuan. This shows that there is great potential in terms of income. The implementation of the 1953 national budget has also proved that the profit plans of some enterprises are conservative, and some tax plans are also insufficient. As a result, the implementation results exceeded the plan by a large amount, which affected the correct implementation of the state's financial revenue and expenditure plan, and caused some departments to form a serious backlog and waste of state funds. Another tendency is to be greedy and rash, making big plans regardless of reality, and blindly asking for money. As a result, the budget is set, but the money cannot be spent, causing dispersion and waste of state funds. For example, although the expenditure on economic construction, social, cultural, and educational expenses, and administrative management expenses in 1953 was better than in the past, the annual expenditure was still only 91.6 percent of the original budget. Analyzing the reasons, in addition to the reduced expenditure due to normal savings, a large part of it was due to the excessively large figures listed in the original budget. In particular, in some aspects of basic construction, budgets and construction plans still have phenomena of not acting according to one's ability. In 1953, except for key projects which were completed relatively well, the construction of other general projects was greatly delayed. For example, 11.6 percent of Shanghai's basic construction projects had to be continued into 1954. Among them, four projects had been delayed until April 1954 due to changes in the foundation, design changes, and problems with the engineering plan. This phenomenon also exists in other regions.

    In addition, phenomena that violate financial discipline, such as falsely reporting and claiming expenses, spending money recklessly, arbitrarily misappropriating state appropriations for designated purposes, arbitrarily raising treatment standards, failing to collect according to laws and regulations or arbitrarily apportioning, and concealing income and expenditure, still exist in some departments. According to statistics from the inspection of 1,132 cases by financial supervision institutions at all levels in the first half of 1953, 234 cases belonged to violations of financial discipline. Among them, the most serious incidents of falsifying final accounts, failing to pay income, and ambushing funds amounted to 140 cases, totaling more than 120 billion yuan, which is shocking. The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government inspected the forestry income of the Forestry Department from 1950 to 1952 and cleared more than 18.6 billion yuan of forest farm income. Except for a small portion turned over in 1952, the remaining 15.1 billion yuan was neither included in the financial plan for payment nor entered into the formal accounting income科目, but was spent on its own and, at the end of the year, falsely reported 1.1 billion yuan of expenditure by using fake receipts. Furthermore, the Benxi City Construction Bureau and the Qinghai Provincial Department of Finance were found to have falsified year-end final accounts. The phenomenon of excessively high construction costs in basic construction project budgets is also relatively common. For example, in 1953, the Northeast Engineering College and other projects contracted by the Northeast Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry were inspected. The engineering profit accounted for 18 percent of the total contracted value, which exceeded the state's stipulated profit rate of 3 percent by several times. In the same year, the Beijing Municipal Government inspected the dormitory projects of various agencies contracted by the Construction Engineering Bureau, and the construction cost was also found to be high. These all need to be corrected. In addition, cases of arbitrarily raising salary and treatment standards in violation of regulations have also been found. Recently, county and district government agencies in many provinces have retained small public funds for arbitrary expenses and arbitrary apportionment to the masses, which are all violations of regulations and should arouse our serious attention. What should be especially pointed out is that lower-level units of some enterprises and institutions, as well as some county and district administrative organs, do not pay enough attention to financial management, and the financial system is very chaotic. Some units have no accounts for financial revenue and expenditure, and some units' accounts do not match their funds and materials, resulting in repeated occurrences of various errors such as loss of funds and items. It is precisely because of the existence of these chaotic phenomena that individual bad elements who embezzle and steal state property have been given an opportunity to take advantage of it. This also shows that there is a reason why some enterprises and institutions still found corruption after the "Three-Anti" movement.

    Although the occurrence of all the above phenomena is related to certain objective factors, such as insufficient experience, unsound systems, inaccurate plans, and the level of financial management not keeping up with the needs of national construction and development, it is impossible to completely avoid the shortcomings of financial management work, the main reason is that these enterprises and institutions do not pay enough attention to financial management, lack the overall concept of the country, and have serious bureaucracy in their work, which must be quickly corrected. The most effective way to correct this is to strengthen financial supervision.

    It should be pointed out that in the past, the financial departments did a very inadequate job in financial supervision. Bureaucracy and red tape are still quite serious among the staff of the financial departments. Many people are only satisfied with written accounting work, focusing on paper review of budgets and final accounts, and rarely go deep into the field for inspection. They often fail to carry out serious struggles against acts of wasting state resources and violating financial discipline. In short, they have not effectively mastered the weapon of financial supervision. This situation is detrimental to the implementation of national construction plans and national budgets and must be quickly changed. The accounting and payment of expenditures, the supervision and payment of income, and in-depth on-site inspection work should be closely combined. We must oppose the practice of simply allocating funds according to the plan, allocating them once and not asking about the actual results. We must conscientiously implement the provisions for conducting on-site inspections in the "Report on the Draft National Budget for 1954," which are "to check whether the enterprise departments have completed their cost reduction plans, financial plans, profit depreciation payment plans, whether there is a backlog of raw materials and a backlog of funds, whether non-production expenses are too large; for basic construction units, to check whether their project costs are too high, whether funds are used according to plan, and how effective the use is; for cultural and educational institutions, to check whether their staffing and quotas are reasonable, and whether their business plans are consistent with their financial plans; for administrative organs, to check whether they have tightened their organization and streamlined personnel in accordance with the central government's regulations, and whether there is a phenomenon of large institutions and overstaffing." In addition, the financial departments should also effectively improve the current financial system, assist relevant departments in formulating necessary staffing and quota standards that are both realistic and in line with the principle of economy, so as to be able to better and more effectively carry out financial supervision work.

    It must be noted that because financial supervision is a new task, many people do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of this work. Therefore, in the work of strengthening financial supervision and strictly enforcing financial discipline, we may still encounter certain obstacles. For example, there may be checked units who emphasize objective difficulties, emphasize that the plan is not accurate enough, emphasize that certain financial systems are not reasonable enough, or find other excuses to refuse inspection. This requires ideological struggle with them to make them understand that it is precisely because the plan is not accurate enough and the system is not reasonable enough that supervision and inspection are even more necessary, so as to revise the plan and improve the system through inspection and prevent all extravagance and waste and violations of state financial discipline that may occur under the cover of inaccurate plans and unreasonable systems. In addition, in the course of work, we may also encounter deliberate resistance from some cadres with impure ideology and work style, which must be resolutely fought against. As long as we can adhere to principles and do things in a realistic and pragmatic spirit, we will certainly be able to overcome difficulties and complete the task.

    In order to carry out this work smoothly, party committees and governments at all levels must strengthen their leadership and support for financial supervision work. The financial departments must frequently report this aspect of work to the party committees and governments for instructions. At the same time, they must obtain the guidance of the People's Supervision Committee and the cooperation of the supervision offices of various economic organs. What is particularly important is to maintain close ties with the masses and obtain the support of the broad masses of the people. When conducting on-site inspections, financial staff must adhere to a serious, responsible, realistic, and pragmatic attitude, that is, on the one hand, they must earnestly and seriously expose various behaviors that violate the financial system and financial discipline; on the other hand, they must also be good at distinguishing the subjective and objective circumstances of various mistakes and conduct a rational and reasonable analysis to prevent mechanically applying the system and imposing big labels, so as to be able to help the inspected units put forward practical improvement methods and promote their undertakings to move forward. In addition, financial departments must carry out on-site inspections in a planned and focused manner, selecting appropriate departments and focusing on key links for systematic and in-depth inspections, so as to solve several problems in a concentrated manner, give full play to the effect of inspection work, and avoid being greedy and dispersing strength.

    We believe that the strengthening of financial supervision will certainly play a significant role in the realization of the 1954 national budget. Therefore, we should complete this task with full confidence.

    加强财政监督，严格财政纪律
    姜明远
    中央人民政府委员会批准的“关于一九五四年国家预算草案的报告”中指出，为了保证一九五四年国家预算的实现，任务之一就是要加强财政监督，严格财政纪律。
    国家预算的实现，决定于预算收入和支出能否按照计划完成，这一点关系着国家各项建设事业按比例地向前发展，关系着我国工业化的速度和进一步提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。一九五四年的国家预算，随着国民经济的上升和国家建设事业的发展，总收入和总支出方面都较去年有相当的增长。但要保证预算的收入能够及时地足额地完成，预算的支出能够合理地节约地使用，从而圆满地实现今年的国家预算，还有待各企业、事业部门、国家行政机关和财政税收部门进行不懈的努力。具体地说，就是要努力增加生产，挖掘潜力，实行严格的节约制度，与浪费国家资金的现象和违反国家财政纪律的现象进行坚决的斗争。而财政部门除了积极组织收入，严格掌握支出外，并负有对各企业、事业部门和国家机关的经济活动和财务活动进行监督的责任。因为我们的财政工作不仅是要动员和分配国家预算资金，而更重要的是通过资金的动员和分配，检查国家建设计划的正确执行和完成程度，以发挥监督的作用，从而达到增加收入、节约支出，正确实施财政制度，和提高财务管理工作水平的目的。因此，加强财政监督，是保证实现一九五四年国家预算的一项重要任务，是帮助企业、事业部门和行政机关改善组织管理，贯彻经济核算，实行严格节约制度的重要方法。
    几年来，由于各级党委和政府的领导与重视，各企业、事业部门和国家机关的财务管理工作已有了显著的进步，企业利润和税收收得是好的，支出的管理也逐年有所改进。但是不可否认，目前在这方面的缺点还是不少的。比较普遍的是某些部门收入计划订得偏于保守，挖掘潜力不够，如黑龙江省一九五三年预算确定之后，该省财政厅以一个多月的时间，组织了一次检查，检查了二十八个地方国营企业和十八个县市以及一部分县市税务局的收入计划，结果就增加了一千二百多亿元的收入。由此说明收入方面潜力是很大的。一九五三年国家预算执行的情况也已证明，若干企业的利润计划是保守的，某些税收计划也打的不足，因而执行结果超额很多，这就影响正确执行国家的财政收支计划，并使某些部门形成严重积压与浪费国家资金的现象。另一种倾向，则是贪多冒进，不顾实际地编造大计划，盲目要钱，结果是预算定了，钱花不出去，造成分散和浪费国家资金的现象。如一九五三年的经济建设费、社会文教费和行政管理费等支出，虽较过去为好，但年终支出仍仅为原预算的百分之九十一点六，分析其原因，除其中一部分是因正常的节约而减少的支出外，很大部分是由于原预算各种项目编列数字过大。特别是某些基本建设方面，预算和建设计划，仍存在着不量力而行的现象，一九五三年的建设项目，除重点工程完成较好外，其他一般工程施工延期是很多的。如上海市的基本建设工程有百分之十一点六须跨入一九五四年继续进行，其中有四项工程，由于地基变更，设计变更以及工程计划存在有问题，一直拖到一九五四年四月尚未开工。这种现象在其他各地也是存在的。
    此外，违反财政纪律的现象如虚报冒领、胡乱开支，把国家指定用途的拨款随便挪用以及擅自提高待遇标准，不按法令规定征收或任意摊派、隐瞒收支等等，在某些部门中仍然存在，根据一九五三年上半年各级财政监察机构检查的一千一百三十二个事件统计，就有二百三十四件是属于违反财政纪律的，其中最严重的造假决算、收入款项不缴、打埋伏的事件有一百四十件，计达一千二百多亿元，实属惊人。黑龙江省人民政府检查林业厅一九五○年至一九五二年三年育林收入及清理林场收入一百八十六亿余元，除一九五二年上缴一小部分外，所余一百五十一亿元是既不列入财务计划上缴，也不登入正式会计收入科目，即自行开支，并于年终利用造假单据的方法，虚报了经费开支十一亿元。又如本溪市建设局、青海省财政厅均发现编报的年终决算亦有造假虚报现象。在基本建设工程预算方面造价偏高现象也比较普遍，如一九五三年检查重工业部东北建设工程公司承包的东北工学院等工程，工程利润占包工总值的百分之十八，超过国家规定利润率百分之三的数倍。同年北京市检查建筑工程局所承包的各机关宿舍工程，造价亦有偏高现象。这都是需要纠正的。另外不按规定办事，擅自提高工薪待遇标准，亦有发现。最近有不少省份的县区政府机关有保留小公家务随便开支及随便向群众摊派现象，这些都是违反规定的，应引起我们严重注意。尤其应当指出的，是某些企业、事业部门的下层单位以及某些县区行政机关对财务管理工作重视还不够，财务制度十分混乱，有的单位财务收支没有账目，有的单位账款、账物不符，以致丢款失物种种差错屡有发生。正由于这些混乱现象的存在，才给了个别贪污盗窃国家财产的坏分子以可乘之机，这也说明某些企业和机关“三反”以后仍发现有贪污现象不是没有原因的。
    所有上述这些现象的产生，虽然与某些客观因素有一定的关系，如经验不足、制度不健全、计划不准确，财务管理水平赶不上国家建设发展的需要，财务管理工作的缺点，还不可能完全避免，但主要的还是由于这些企业和机关对财务管理工作注意不够，缺乏国家的整体观念以及工作中有严重的官僚主义，这是必须迅速纠正的。最有效的纠正办法是加强财政监督。
    应该指出：过去财政部门在财政监督工作方面是做的很不够的，官僚主义和文牍主义在财政部门机关工作人员中还相当严重，不少人员只满足于书面的核算工作，偏重于纸面审核预算决算，很少深入现场进行检查，对于浪费国家资财违反财政纪律的行为，往往不能进行严肃的斗争。总之，是没有切实地掌握起财政监督的武器。这种状况对国家建设计划和国家预算的执行是不利的，必须迅速加以改变，应把支出的核计拨付，收入的督促解缴和深入现场检查工作密切结合起来，要反对那种只是按计划拨款，一拨了事，不问实际效果的作风。要认真地执行“关于一九五四年国家预算草案的报告”中对于进行实地检查的规定，就是“对企业部门，要检查他们降低成本计划、财务计划、利润折旧缴款计划是否完成，有无积压原材料和积压资金的现象，非生产的开支是否过大；对基本建设单位，要检查他们的工程造价是否过高，款项是否按计划使用，使用的效果如何；对文教事业机关，要检查他们的定员定额是否合理，事业计划和财务计划是否相符；对行政机关，要检查他们是否按中央规定，紧缩编制，精简人员，有无机构庞大、人浮于事的现象。”此外，财政部门还应切实地改进现行财政制度，协助有关部门订定既切合实际又符合节约原则的必要的定员定额标准，以便能够更好地和更有效地进行财政监督工作。
    必须注意的是，由于财政监督是一项新的工作，许多人对这一工作的重要性还认识不足，因此，在加强财政监督，严格财政纪律的工作中还可能遇到某些阻碍。例如，可能会有这样的被检查单位，他们强调客观困难，强调计划不够准确，强调某些财政制度不够合理，或者找出其他种种借口而拒绝检查。这就需要向他们进行思想斗争，使他们懂得，正是因为计划不够准确，制度不够合理，才更加需要监督与检查，以便通过检查来修正计划，改善制度，并防止一切在计划不准确、制度不合理的掩护下可能发生的铺张浪费和违反国家财政纪律的行为。另外，在工作进行中也可能遭遇到某些思想作风不纯的干部的有意抵抗，这就必须与之进行坚决的斗争，只要我们能够坚持原则，本着实事求是的精神去做，就一定能够克服困难，完成任务。
    为了顺利地进行这一工作，各级党委和政府必须加强对财政监督工作的领导和支持，财政部门必须经常将这方面的工作向党委和政府请示报告，同时要取得人民监察委员会的指导和各经济机关监察室的配合，特别重要的是要密切联系群众，取得广大人民的支持。在进行实地检查时，财政工作人员要坚持严肃负责实事求是的态度，这就是一方面要认真严肃地揭发各种违反财政制度和财政纪律的行为；另一方面也要善于区别各种过失发生的主客观情况，进行合情合理的分析，防止机械地搬用制度、扣大帽子，以便能够帮助被检查单位提出切合实际的改进办法，促使其事业向前推进。此外，财政部门对现场检查必须是有计划地有重点地进行，要选择适当的部门，抓住主要环节进行系统深入的检查，以便集中地解决几个问题，发挥检查工作的效果，避免贪多，分散力量。
    我们相信，财政监督的加强，对于一九五四年国家预算的实现必能发挥重大的作用，因此我们应该怀着充分的信心去完成这一任务。
