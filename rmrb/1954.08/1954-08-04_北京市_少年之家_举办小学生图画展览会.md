	The Beijing "Children's Home" is holding the Beijing Elementary School Student Painting Exhibition from August 1st.

	The exhibition features more than 460 paintings selected from more than 1,700 paintings from more than 100 elementary schools. The themes of the paintings are wide-ranging, and the content is relatively rich. The paintings are full of children's characteristics and express their hobbies and ideals. The first exhibition room displays sketches, including landscape sketches, still life sketches, and figure sketches. The second exhibition room displays themed paintings, including paintings made by elementary school students based on their daily life, and illustrations they painted based on plot details in elementary school Chinese, history, and other textbooks. Many of the paintings here express the children's noble qualities of loving the motherland, loving science, and loving labor. Two paintings, one by each of two ten-year-old elementary school students, depicting the night scene of "May 1st," both show the scene of a carnival night. Some children are also good at exploring fresh themes in their paintings. For example, a painting by a student from Dongbanqiao Elementary School depicting a group of children holding a meeting to send off a graduating senior elementary school student to participate in labor production, and four health propaganda paintings (depicting children's expressions and actions of catching mice and flies) drawn by a seven-year-old elementary school student from the Second Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University, are such works. The third exhibition room displays elementary school students' pattern paintings, including various beautiful floral fabrics and cover designs designed by lower grade students in combination with natural objects and higher grade students in combination with practicality. Some patterns are not only brightly colored but also depicted in great detail. The exhibition also features paintings by students from the Beijing No. 2 School for the Deaf. Under the cultivation of the school, this group of deaf and mute children also showed very good wisdom and talent. The two watercolor paintings "Always be Ready: Strive to Realize Chairman Mao's Great Ideal!" and "A Day Never to be Forgotten" in this section of exhibits have won the love of visitors.

    北京市“少年之家”
    举办小学生图画展览会
    北京市“少年之家”从八月一日起举办北京市小学学生图画展览会。
    会上展出的四百六十多幅图画，是从一百多个小学的一千七百多幅图画中选出的。图画的题材很广泛，内容也较丰富。画面都富有儿童的特点，表现了儿童们的爱好和理想。第一展览室展出的是写生画，有风景写生、静物写生，也有人物写生。第二展览室展出的是主题画，其中有小学生们根据日常生活所作的图画，也有他们根据小学语文、历史等课文中的故事情节所画的插画。这里的许多幅画都表现了孩子们爱祖国、爱科学、爱劳动的高贵品质。两幅由两个十岁的小学生分别画的“五一”的夜景，都能显示出狂欢夜晚的情景。有些孩子在绘画中，还善于发掘新鲜的题材。如东板桥小学一个学生画的描绘一群孩子开会欢送一个高小毕业生去参加劳动生产的图画，北京师范大学第二附属小学一个七岁小学生画的四幅卫生宣传画（描写小孩子捉老鼠和捕苍蝇的表情和动作），就都是这样的作品。第三展览室陈列的是小学生们的图案画，有低年级学生结合自然物品和高年级学生结合实用所设计出的各种美丽的花布、封面等图案。有些图案不仅彩色鲜艳，而且描绘得很细致。会上展出的还有北京市第二聋哑学校学生的图画。这群聋哑的孩子们在学校的培养下也显示了很好的智慧和才能。这部分展品中的“时刻准备着：为实现毛主席的伟大理想而奋斗！”和“永远不能忘记的一天”两幅水彩画，都博得参观者的喜爱。（新华社）
