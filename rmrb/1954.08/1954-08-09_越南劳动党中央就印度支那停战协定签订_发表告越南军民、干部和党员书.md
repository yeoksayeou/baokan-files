Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, August 5th: The Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party issued a letter on July 25th to the Vietnamese people, army, cadres in all work departments, and all party members regarding the signing of the Indochina Armistice Agreement.

The letter first pointed out that the signing of the Indochina Armistice Agreement was the result of the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, soldiers, and cadres over the past nine years; it was the result of the support of peace-loving people all over the world, and the persistent struggle of the delegations of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China at the Geneva Conference.

The letter said: Peace is being restored on this Peninsula on the following basis; The Government of France respects the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia; within a specified period, the countries of Indochina will achieve national unification through free general elections; no foreign military bases may be established within Indochina; Vietnam and France will establish economic and cultural relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, etc.

The letter said: The signing of the above-mentioned armistice agreement is a great victory for our people and army. It is also a victory for peace-loving people all over the world, as well as the people of fraternal countries who have been fighting to ease international tensions. Our victory is also a defeat for the colonialist aggressors who plotted to enslave the people of Indochina; it is a defeat for the American imperialists who are now attempting to turn Indochina into an American colony and strategic base.

This victory proves that no perfidious conspiracy or any power in the world can conquer a united nation that is determined to smash the shackles of enslavement and defeat foreign invaders. This victory also proves that the world's peace forces are growing stronger day by day and can stop the bloody hands of imperialist warmongers, extinguish the flames of war in certain places, safeguard world peace, and ease international tensions. It opens up new prospects for resolving other international disputes through negotiation.

The letter said: Today, peace is being restored under fair and reasonable conditions in accordance with the specific circumstances of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. However, our people must continue to struggle to ensure that the other party faithfully fulfills the agreed-upon terms and continue to negotiate with us to resolve the remaining issues.

The letter called on everyone to strictly abide by the government's orders within the scope of his responsibilities and carefully fulfill the terms signed by our government delegation at the Geneva Conference.

The letter said: The armistice agreement stipulates the readjustment of areas: our armed forces will withdraw from South Vietnam and concentrate in the North, while the French Federation forces will withdraw from the North and temporarily station in the South. This measure is necessary to restore and consolidate peace due to the complex situation on the Vietnamese front. But we will struggle and are determined to conduct free general elections throughout the country to achieve national unification. Our compatriots should not be deceived by the false propaganda of the American imperialists and French war-mongers, and should not think that the readjustment of areas means "national division."

The letter said: Now, the armistice is being realized. The patriotic struggle of our people has entered a new stage. The form of armed struggle has now been replaced by the form of political struggle. But like armed struggle, political struggle must be long-term and arduous before complete victory is achieved. The current tasks of our entire people and party are still very heavy. We must strive to struggle to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and achieve national independence and democracy.

The letter said: To this end, it is necessary to consolidate national defense; vigorously mobilize the peasant masses to carry out land reform; strengthen the friendly relations between the Vietnamese people and the people of Laos and Cambodia with the people of the Soviet Union and China; further unite with the French people; and maintain close ties with the peace movement in Southeast Asia and the world.

The letter emphasized: A small handful of greedy and unwilling colonialists still want to plot to undermine the armistice agreement and are unwilling to resolve the political issues related to Vietnam and France. Our entire People's Army and the entire Party should maintain high vigilance, continue to improve their fighting spirit, and overcome subjectivism, underestimating the enemy's strength, complacent ideas, defeatism, and arrogance.

The letter pointed out that the ideological unity and solidarity of the entire Party is more necessary now than ever before. The letter called on all the people, the army, and the entire Party to unite their ranks more closely around Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Central Committee of the Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and to carry the struggle through to the end with the heroic fighting spirit tempered in the war of national defense, and resolutely realize a peaceful, unified, independent, and democratic Vietnam.

The letter concluded: Under the glorious banner of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, our people will accomplish the great tasks entrusted to us by the new historical period and will surely achieve the above goals.

    越南劳动党中央就印度支那停战协定签订
    发表告越南军民、干部和党员书
    【新华社七日讯】据越南通讯社北越五日讯：越南劳动党中央委员会在七月二十五日就印度支那停战协定的签订发表告越南人民、军队、各工作部门干部以及全体党员书。
    文告首先指出，印度支那停战协定的签订是越南全国人民、战士和干部们在过去九年中英勇斗争的结果；是全世界爱好和平人民的支持，和越南、苏联与中华人民共和国的代表团在日内瓦会议上坚持斗争的结果。
    文告说：在下列的基础上，这个半岛的和平正在恢复：法国政府尊重越南、老挝和柬埔寨的独立、主权、统一和领土完整；在一个规定的时期内，印度支那各国将通过自由的普选来实现国家的统一；在印度支那境内，不得建立任何属于外国的军事基地；越南和法国将在平等互利的基础上建立经济和文化关系等等。
    文告说：上述停战协定的签订是我国人民和军队的一个巨大胜利。也是全世界爱好和平的人民以及一直为缓和国际紧张局势而进行斗争的兄弟国家的人民的胜利。我们的胜利也就是阴谋奴役印度支那人民的殖民主义侵略者的失败；是现在正在企图把印度支那变成美国的一个殖民地和战略基地的美帝国主义者的失败。
    这次胜利证明了：任何背信的阴谋或世界上的任何力量都不能征服一个团结的并且有决心粉碎奴役的枷锁和击败外国侵略者的国家。这次胜利同时证明，世界和平力量已一天比一天增长并且可以制止帝国主义战争贩子的血手，在一定的地方扑灭战争火焰，保卫世界和平并缓和国际紧张局势。它为通过协商解决其他国际争端开辟了新的前景。
    文告说：今天，在符合越南、老挝和柬埔寨的具体情况的公平合理的条件下，和平正在恢复。但我国人民还必须进行斗争，促使对方忠实地履行已经取得协议的条款，并继续和我方进行谈判以解决其余问题。
    文告号召：每个人应该在他的责任范围内严格遵守政府的命令，并仔细地履行我国政府代表团在日内瓦会议上签字的条款。
    文告说：停战协定规定要重新调整地区：我国武装部队将从南越撤出，在北部集结，而法兰西联邦部队将自北部撤出，暂时驻扎在南部。由于越南战线的复杂情况，有必要采取这种措施以便恢复和巩固和平。但是我们将进行斗争，决心在全国进行自由的普选，以实现国家统一。我国同胞们不要受美帝国主义者和法国战争贩子的虚假宣传的欺骗，不要认为重新调整地区意味着“国家分治”。
    文告说：现在，停战已在实现。我国人民的爱国斗争已进入一个新的阶段。武装斗争的形式现在已由政治斗争的形式来代替。但是政治斗争和武装斗争一样，在没有达到完全胜利之前，一定是长期和艰巨的。我国全体人民和党的目前任务仍然是很重的。我们必须努力斗争，以巩固和平，实现统一和取得全国的独立和民主。
    文告说：为了这个目的，必须巩固国防；大力动员农民群众进行土地改革；加强越南人民和老挝及柬埔寨人民同苏联和中国的人民之间的友好关系；进一步同法国人民团结起来，同东南亚及全世界的和平运动保持紧密的联系。
    文告强调指出：一小撮贪婪而心犹未甘的殖民主义者仍然想阴谋破坏停战协定，不愿意解决同越南及法国有关的政治问题。我国全体人民军和全党应保持高度警惕，继续不断提高斗争精神，克服主观主义、过低估计敌人力量、太平观念、失败主义和骄傲自满情绪。
    文告指出：目前，全党的思想一致和团结较以往任何时候更为必要。文告号召全体人民、军队和全党把自己的队伍更加紧密地团结在胡志明主席、党中央委员会和越南民主共和国政府的周围，并以他们在卫国战争中钢铁般锻炼出来的英勇战斗精神把斗争进行到底，坚决地实现一个和平、统一、独立和民主的越南。
    文告最后说：我国人民在胡志明主席的光荣旗帜下，将完成新的历史时期所交付给我们的伟大任务，并且定将达到上述目标。
