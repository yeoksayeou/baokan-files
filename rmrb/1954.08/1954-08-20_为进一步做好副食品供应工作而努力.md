Editor's Note: After the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Developing Hog Production" this April, thanks to the leadership of Party and government organs at all levels and the efforts of farmers, hog production has developed in the past few months. To further increase hog production, we should actively explore sources of pig feed and strengthen feeding management. Several articles published in this newspaper today provide some experience in these two aspects, which can be used as a reference for various places. At present, food companies in flood-stricken areas, in order to support the victims, should actively cooperate with production and disaster relief under the unified leadership of the local Party and government, purchase hogs and properly support hog production in disaster areas; all regions, especially export port cities and sales areas, should vigorously support disaster areas, strive to expand purchases, strengthen balanced allocation, and do a good job in storage and feeding.

    Striving to Further Improve the Supply of Non-Staple Foods
    Chen Jingzhi, Deputy Manager of China Food Company

    In order to meet the needs of national construction and the continuous improvement of people's material life, the Central Ministry of Commerce established the China Food Company in January this year in accordance with the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. In the past six months, under the leadership of Party committees and people's governments at all levels, the national food company system has established organizational structures and strengthened the management of non-staple foods. Among them, through the pre-purchase of hogs, the scope of procurement has been expanded, so in the case of relatively difficult sources of pigs, the export tasks have been completed, and appropriate arrangements have been made for the domestic market supply, initially strengthening the planning of the supply work and ensuring the stability of the prices of major non-staple foods.

    In the past six months, the operation and management of the food company system has made some progress, and many new creations have emerged, and many model units and cadres have emerged. For example, the double-layer pig loading method has been widely adopted in various places, saving transportation power and expenses; Zhumadian, Henan, has created a square bamboo basket egg loading method, which has improved transportation efficiency and reduced the loss of fresh eggs. From July 1953 to May of this year, the Jiangyan Purchasing Station in Jiangsu Province purchased and continuously stored a total of 32,451 hogs in eleven months, without a single death, creating the first safe and death-free hog warehouse in Jiangsu Province. The pig farm of Jiaoxian Branch of Shandong Province improved the feeding management methods of hogs and established feeding, pen loosening, and health inspection systems. In the past four months, it has raised a total of 5,638 pigs, but none died, and few sick pigs were found, and the hogs could gain 1.28 jin per day after entering the farm for three days; Xuchang Branch of Henan Province created the lowest transportation loss record of transporting 2,480 live pigs for 7,000 li, with only one death after seven days and nights of driving; Comrade Wang Xicheng, the escort of the first warehouse of the company, due to his active responsibility and patient care for pigs, has escorted more than 6,000 live pigs without any casualties; Pan Rui, a demobilized soldier of Hunan Food Company, was selected as an advanced worker of the provincial-level state-owned commercial unit in Hunan Province because he relied on the masses, worked hard, and worked selflessly, saving a large number of hog deaths; Comrade Long Xiyuan, who has been working as a feeder at the Zhuzhou Branch of Hunan Province for more than six years, has not only been consistently active and responsible, hardworking and enduring, paying attention to feeding methods, and doing a good job in cleaning and sanitation to reduce pig diseases, but also learned to treat pig erysipelas, swine fever and mange pigs in his daily work. He has cured 149 hogs, reducing the loss of state property. Because of these new creations and model cadres, our operation and management work has been greatly improved, greatly reducing the death of pigs, thereby increasing the social supply power.

    However, there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work, and our work cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the objective situation: First of all, the arrangement of domestic market supply work is not satisfactory; the adjustment of the supply level between cities is not reasonable enough, some cities are often satisfied or have surplus in supply, while some cities are often in short supply; in the control of the supply level between urban and rural areas, there are also phenomena that the rural towns are much higher than the large and medium-sized cities, or that the supply of rural towns is controlled too strictly. Secondly, in terms of operation and management, there are still very serious bureaucracy and irresponsibility in many areas; taking the Shangqiu Branch of Henan Province as an example: in 1953 alone, the loss of live pigs, a kind of commodity, was more than 8.4 billion yuan, accounting for 10.31% of the total turnover of live pigs, but these lessons failed to attract the attention of the company's leadership, and the work situation this year is still loose organization and chaotic system, resulting in continuous serious deaths in the storage and transportation of live pigs. After March 15, the average daily death of live pigs in stock was more than five, and from April 1 to 20, 619 live pigs in stock died, and the mortality rate of live pigs transported to Shanghai and other places was as high as 32%. This serious incident was caused by bureaucracy. Although this situation is individual, bureaucracy and irresponsibility to varying degrees are still relatively common. This is a serious problem in our operation and management, and also in our entire work. Thirdly, there is still a lack of foresight and planning in the purchasing work. The organization of goods is sometimes too much and sometimes too little. If there is too little, the supply is insufficient. If there is too much, it is easy to cause losses due to the difficulty of storing fresh and live commodities. In addition, in the pre-purchase of hogs, many regions do not carry out the exchange and credit pre-purchase of hogs in a planned way according to the actual needs of pig farmers, but put the main force on the cash pre-purchase work. In the pre-purchase work, the work is not in-depth and specific, and there are many phenomena of selling empty pigs. As a result, the completion of the current purchase task in April was affected, and the supply of feed was also affected. In the relationship between state-owned companies and cooperatives, some areas have shown a lack of coordination; the two sides do not carry out division of labor in an organized manner and purchase in a planned manner according to the state's purchase tasks, but there is a situation of competing for goods in concentrated producing areas and shirking responsibilities to each other in scattered producing areas, which affects the completion of the purchase tasks.

    The reasons for these shortcomings and errors are mainly due to the lack of foresight in the leadership of the China Food Company in its work, and the fact that the institutions in various places are mostly newly built and the contact between the upper and lower levels is insufficient, which has failed to give play to its due leadership role, which should be improved in the future.

    At present, the weather is hot, which has increased the difficulty in the operation of fresh and live commodities, and the peak season for the production and sales of non-staple foods is coming soon. In order to further improve the supply of non-staple foods, we must pay attention to the following tasks:

    First, under the leadership of the Party committees and people's governments in various places, closely rely on cooperatives to strengthen the guidance of hog production and the planning of purchasing work. Hog is one of the main non-staple foods. In order to meet the needs of the country and the continuous improvement of people's material life, it is necessary to develop hog production and do a good job in purchasing. Party committees and governments at all levels attach importance to hog production and purchasing work. After several months of efforts, preliminary results have been achieved in the work; however, because hogs are live commodities, they are easy to die and be injured, and it is difficult to transport and adjust them. Under the current equipment conditions, in order to avoid the uneven supply of too much and too little, it is necessary to strengthen the planning of production guidance and purchasing work. In terms of production guidance, special attention should be paid to the development of hog production in urban suburbs and areas with convenient transportation, in order to increase the source of commodity pigs and facilitate the strengthening of planning in purchasing, allocation and supply. In the purchasing work, we must emphasize the combination of state-owned companies and cooperatives, and oppose the practice of各自为政 (each doing things in his own way) and competing for goods. Except for a few key pig-producing areas where there is already a purchasing foundation, state-owned companies should continue to maintain direct purchasing. Other areas should conduct agency purchasing through cooperatives. Through agency purchasing, pig production should gradually develop towards the road of cooperation, so as to further improve the planning of production and purchasing work.

    At present, in some flood-stricken areas, food companies should actively cooperate with production and disaster relief, carry out hog purchases and properly arrange hog production in disaster areas.

    Second, improve operation and management, strengthen transportation and feeding work, reduce hog deaths, and enrich the supply. Developing hog production is the material power to ensure supply, but only production develops without improving operation and management, doing a good job in transportation and feeding, will result in a large number of hog deaths, reducing the power of supply. Experience has proved that the main key to improving operation and management lies in improving purchasing inspection, storage and feeding, and transportation work; in improving purchasing inspection work, on the one hand, we should pay attention to improving the inspection technology of purchasing personnel, and effectively prevent the corruption and bribery of transaction personnel; on the other hand, we must educate farmers not to sell hogs that are full and have big bellies, so as to avoid large losses to the country and affect feeding after purchasing. In improving storage and feeding work, we must establish a scientific management system (such as regular and quantitative feeding of hogs, regular pen loosening, regular inspection and disinfection, etc.) and storage and feeding responsibility system according to the characteristics of fresh and live commodities, in order to reduce deaths and losses, and strive to increase the weight of hogs after a certain period of feeding. In terms of transportation work, on the one hand, we must strengthen the planning of transportation work to ensure balanced allocation, so as to avoid insufficient supply and a large backlog; on the other hand, we must strengthen the sense of responsibility and technical education of escort personnel, establish an escort responsibility system and a strict reward and punishment system, eliminate transportation accidents, and reduce transportation losses. Only by doing the above tasks well can we reduce losses, reduce costs, and speed up capital turnover; can we ensure the completion of domestic supply and export tasks. Therefore, all the employees of the entire food company system must take action, resolutely fight against bureaucracy and irresponsible phenomena, vigorously improve operation and management, and strive to reduce hog deaths and reduce commodity losses.

    Third, strengthen policy research, correct business thinking, complete export tasks, and do a good job in domestic market supply. At present, the imbalance between cities and between urban and rural areas in domestic supply is due to the fact that production is not balanced between regions, it is impossible to achieve complete consistency. It is related to the fact that some leading cadres of food companies in some areas have localism in their business thinking and lack an overall concept; in the allocation of materials, when the source of goods is lacking, they are often unwilling to transfer out or unwilling to transfer out more, which affects the supply of sales areas; when the source of goods is surplus, they often do not allocate according to plan, or allocate beyond the plan, especially when there are too many sources of fresh and live commodities, some units, in order to reduce their own losses and unload their responsibilities, transfer out a large amount of goods, pouring into the sales areas, which often causes greater losses. Of course, companies in sales areas also have situations where they do not take care of the difficulties of companies in producing areas. This is most likely to disrupt the pre-planned plan and cause the work to be passive. Therefore, in future work, we must overcome localism, promote the overall concept, and establish a business thinking of taking care of the overall situation and obeying policies. Under the guidance of this correct business thinking, closely rely on the leadership of Party committees and governments in various places, strengthen the planning of purchase and sales, resolutely ensure the completion of export tasks, and earnestly take responsibility for doing a good job in the supply of domestic non-staple foods; according to the source of goods, under the premise of ensuring the completion of export tasks, appropriately arrange the supply needs of large cities and industrial and mining areas, and take care of the consumption needs of small and medium-sized cities and market towns; we should prevent the two deviations of excessive consumption in rural towns affecting exports and the supply of large cities; and excessively strict restrictions on the consumption needs of small and medium-sized cities and rural towns. Give play to foresight in work and strengthen the planning of purchase and sales, so as to do a good job in the supply of domestic and foreign sales and gradually meet the growing needs of the country and the people. This is our glorious responsibility.

    编者按：中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会今年四月发出“关于发展毛猪生产的指示”后，几个月来，在各地党政机关的领导和农民的努力下，毛猪生产有了发展。为进一步增加毛猪生产，目前应积极开辟猪食来源和加强饲养管理。今天本报发表的几篇文章，在这两方面都提供了一些经验，可供各地参考。目前水灾区域的食品公司，为了支援灾民，应在当地党政统一领导下，积极配合生产救灾，收购毛猪并妥善支持灾区毛猪生产；各地特别是出口口岸城市和销售区应大力支援灾区，努力扩大收购量，并加强均衡调拨，做好保管饲养工作。
    为进一步做好副食品供应工作而努力
    中国食品公司副经理  陈静之
    为适应国家建设和人民物质生活不断提高的需要，中央商业部根据政务院财政经济委员会的指示，于今年一月份成立了中国食品公司。半年来全国食品公司系统，在各级党委与人民政府的领导下，建立组织机构，加强了副食品的经营。其中通过毛猪预购工作，扩大收购面，因而在猪源比较困难的情况下，完成了出口任务，并对国内市场供应进行了适当的安排，初步加强了供应工作的计划性，保证了主要副食品价格的稳定。
    半年来，食品公司系统的经营管理方面有了一定程度的进步，出现了不少新的创造，涌现了很多模范单位与干部。如各地比较普遍地采用了双层装猪法，节省了运输力量与费用；河南驻马店创造方形竹篓鸡蛋装载法，提高了运输效率，减少了鲜蛋损耗。江苏省姜埝收购站从一九五三年七月到今年五月，十一个月当中共收购和陆续储存毛猪三二、四五一头，没有死亡过一头，创造了江苏省第一个安全无死亡的毛猪仓库。山东胶县支公司猪栈，改善了毛猪饲养管理方法，建立了喂食、松圈、卫生检查等制度，四个月来，先后共养猪五、六三八头，但无一死亡，也很少发现病猪，并能使毛猪进栈三日后每日增加体重一点二八斤；河南许昌支公司创造了二、四八○头活猪运输七千华里，行车七昼夜仅死亡一头的最低运输损耗纪录；该公司第一仓库押运员王喜成同志由于积极负责、耐心爱护猪只，先后押运活猪六千余头，无一伤亡；湖南省食品公司转业军人潘瑞同志由于他依靠群众，刻苦钻研，忘我工作，挽救了大量毛猪的死亡，被湖南省选为国营商业省级单位先进工作者；湖南省株州支公司做了六年多饲养工作的龙喜元同志不但一贯积极负责，刻苦耐劳，注意饲养方法，随时做好清洁卫生工作减少猪只病疫，而且还在日常工作中学会了治疗猪丹毒、猪肺疫和癞子猪的方法，经他手治好的毛猪即达一四九头；减少了国家财产的损失。由于有了这些新的创造和模范的干部，使我们的经营管理工作有了很多的改善，大大减少了猪只的死亡，从而增加了社会的供应力量。
    但是我们工作中还存在着很多的缺点和错误，我们的工作还赶不上客观形势发展的需要：首先表现在，对国内市场供应工作的安排还不能令人满意；对于城市之间的供应水平的调剂还不够合理，有些城市的供应经常满足或有余，有些城市则经常供应不足；在城市与农村的供应水平掌握上，亦有着农村城镇高于大中城市很多，或对农村城镇供应控制过死的现象。其次在经营管理上，很多地区还存在着非常严重的官僚主义和不负责任的现象；以河南商邱支公司为例：在一九五三年仅活猪一种商品就损耗八十四亿余元，占全部活猪经营额百分之十点三一，但这些教训未能引起该公司领导上的重视，今年的工作状况仍旧是组织松弛、制度混乱，以致在活猪的保管、运输上连续造成严重的死亡事故，三月十五日以后，库存活猪每天平均死亡五头以上，四月一日至二十日库存活猪死亡六一九头，在运往上海等地的活猪中死亡率高达百分之三十二，这一严重事件就是由于官僚主义所造成的，这种情况虽是个别的，但不同程度的官僚主义和不负责任现象，还是比较普遍存在的，这是我们经营管理上，也是我们整个工作上的严重问题。再次是收购工作中，还缺乏预见性和计划性，货源的组织，时多时少，少了供应不足，多了由于鲜活商品难以保管，则易造成损失；另外在毛猪预购工作中，很多地区不是根据养猪农民的实际需要情况，有计划地进行毛猪换购和信用预购工作，却把主要力量放在了现金预购工作上，在预购工作中，工作也不深入具体，存在着不少卖空猪的现象。结果影响了四月份现购任务的完成，同时也影响了饲料的供应。在国营公司与合作社的关系上某些地区表现了不够协调；双方不是根据国家收购任务，有组织的进行分工，有计划的进行收购，而存在着在集中产区互争货源，在分散产区则相互推诿情况，影响了收购任务的完成。
    产生这些缺点和错误的原因，主要是由于中国食品公司的领导上在工作上的预见性不够，加以各地机构多系新建，上下联系不够，未能发挥应有的领导作用，这是应该今后改进的。
      目前天气炎热，更增加了鲜活商品经营中的困难，而副食品的产销旺季又快到来，为进一步做好副食品的供应工作，必须注意做好以下几项工作：
    第一、在各地党委与人民政府的领导下，紧密依靠合作社，加强毛猪生产的指导与收购工作中的计划性。毛猪是主要副食品之一，为了适应国家与人民物质生活不断提高的需要，必须发展毛猪生产和做好收购工作。各地党委与政府对于毛猪生产与收购工作是重视的。经过几个月来的努力，工作上已获得初步成效；但由于毛猪是活商品，易死易伤，运输调剂困难，在目前设备条件下，为了避免时多时少的供应不均衡的情况发生，必须加强生产指导与收购工作的计划性。在生产指导上应特别注意发展城市郊区和交通便利、易于运输地区的毛猪生产，以增加商品猪的来源，和便于加强收购调拨及供应中的计划性。在收购工作中则必须强调国营公司与合作社的结合，反对各自为政，互争货源的做法，国营公司除少数重点产猪区已有收购基础仍维持直接收购外，其他地区均应通过合作社进行代购，通过代购工作，使养猪生产逐步向着合作化的道路发展；以进一步提高生产与收购工作中的计划性。
    目前在部分水灾地区，食品公司应积极配合生产救灾，展开毛猪收购与妥善安排灾区毛猪生产。
    第二、改善经营管理，加强运输、饲养工作，减少毛猪死亡，充实供应力量。发展毛猪生产是保证供应的物质力量，但只有生产发展而不改善经营管理，做好运输、饲养工作，结果会造成毛猪大量死亡，减少了供应的力量。经验证明，改善经营管理的主要关键，在于改善收购检验、保管饲养和运输工作；在改善收购检验工作中，一方面要注意提高收购人员的检验技术，并切实防止交易人员的贪污受贿情况；另一方面要教育农民不要出售饱食大肚毛猪，以免造成国家大量亏损和影响收购以后的饲养。在改善保管饲养工作中，要根据鲜活商品的特性，建立科学的管理制度（如毛猪定时定量喂食，定时松圈定期检验、消毒等工作制度）和保管饲养负责制，以减少死亡与损耗，并力争经过一定饲养时间后的毛猪增加体重。在运输工作上，一方面要加强运输工作的计划性，保证做到均衡调拨，以避免供应不足和大量积压；另一方面要加强押运人员的责任心与技术教育，建立押运负责制和严格的奖惩制度，杜绝发生运输事故，减少运输损耗。只有做好以上几项工作，才能减少损耗，降低费用，加速资金周转；才能保证国内供应和出口任务的完成。因此全食品公司系统的职工同志们要行动起来，坚决与官僚主义和不负责的现象做斗争，大力改善经营管理，为减少毛猪死亡，减少商品损耗而奋斗。
    第三、加强政策研究，端正经营思想，完成出口任务，做好国内市场供应工作。目前国内供应上城市之间和城乡之间不平衡现象，除因地区之间生产不平衡，不可能达到完全一致外，是与某些地区食品公司领导干部经营思想上存在着本位主义，缺乏整体观念有关的；在物资调拨中，货源缺乏时，往往不愿调出或不愿多调出，影响销区供应；当货源有余时则往往不按计划平衡调拨，或超计划的调拨，特别是当着鲜活商品货源过多时某些单位为了减少本身损失，卸脱责任，大量调出，涌至销区，往往造成更大损失。当然在销区公司也有不照顾产区公司困难的情况。这样最易打乱预定计划，造成工作的被动。因此，今后工作中必须克服本位主义，发扬整体观念，树立照顾全局、服从政策的经营思想。在此正确的经营思想指导下，密切依靠各地党委和政府的领导，加强购销计划性，坚决保证完成出口任务，并切实负责做好国内副食品的供应工作；根据货源情况，在保证完成出口任务的前提下，适当地安排大城市和工矿区供应需要，并照顾中小城市集镇的消费需要；应防止农村城镇消费过大影响出口与大城市供应；和不管中小城市农村城镇的消费需要限制过死的两种偏向。发挥工作中的预见性，加强购销计划性，以做好内外销的供应工作，逐步满足国家与人民不断增长的需要。这是我们光荣的责任。
