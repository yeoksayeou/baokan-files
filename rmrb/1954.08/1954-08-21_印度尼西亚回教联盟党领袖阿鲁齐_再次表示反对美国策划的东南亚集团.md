Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 19th: Arudji, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Indonesian Muslim League, reiterated his firm opposition to the US-planned "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" at a mass meeting of the Indonesian Muslim League held in Semarang on the 15th.

Arudji said that the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" is destructive to Asian countries that are undergoing construction, and even more so to those countries that have just gained independence. The United States' proposal has been rejected by these countries because if these countries participate in the established "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," disaster will befall them. The "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" only benefits the United States. It means that it is beneficial for the United States to find the raw materials it needs and wants to buy cheaply.

Arudji also issued an appeal to the people of Indonesia and the people of Asia, asking them to be vigilant about the plan to establish the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

Arudji also mentioned that the Indonesian people must continue to fight for the realization of the demand to recover West Irian.

    印度尼西亚回教联盟党领袖阿鲁齐
    再次表示反对美国策划的东南亚集团
    【新华社雅加达十九日电】印度尼西亚回教联盟党中央执行委员会主席阿鲁齐十五日在三宝垄召开的印度尼西亚回教联盟党群众大会上，再次表示坚决反对美国计划成立的“东南亚公约组织”。
    阿鲁齐说，“东南亚公约组织”对于正在进行建设的亚洲国家是一种破坏，对于那些刚刚取得独立的国家来说更是这样。美国的建议已遭到了这些国家的拒绝，因为如果这些国家参加建立起来的“东南亚公约组织”的话，灾难就会落到它们的头上。“东南亚公约组织”只对美国有利。它意味着有利于美国寻找它所需要的并想以廉价购买的原料。
    阿鲁齐并向印度尼西亚人民和亚洲人民发出呼吁，要求他们对成立“东南亚公约组织”的计划保持警惕。
    阿鲁齐还谈到，印度尼西亚人民必须为争取实现收回西伊里安的要求而继续奋斗。
