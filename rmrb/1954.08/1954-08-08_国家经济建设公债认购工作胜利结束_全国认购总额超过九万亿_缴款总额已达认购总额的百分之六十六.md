Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds has been successfully oversubscribed due to the enthusiastic subscriptions of the people nationwide, demonstrating a high level of patriotism. As of the statistics of July 24th, the total subscription amount by the people nationwide reached 9.2 trillion yuan, exceeding the original bond issuance plan of 6 trillion yuan by over 53 percent. Now, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, according to the instructions of the Government Administration Council, has notified all parts of the country to stop subscriptions after August 10th and announced the victorious conclusion of this year's bond subscription work.

The bond payment situation is generally good, but the progress varies from region to region. As of July 20th, the total amount of bond payments nationwide reached 66.6 percent of the total subscription amount. Among them, the Northeast Region has reached 92.41 percent, the North China Region 76.19 percent, the Inner Mongolia Region 75.25 percent, the East China Region 68.38 percent, the Southwest Region 56.93 percent, the Northwest Region 50.44 percent, and the Central South Region 47.22 percent. In order to successfully complete the state's bond issuance plan, all regions must continue to firmly grasp the work of depositing bond payments into the treasury.

The vast number of staff and workers, especially the armed forces, have consistently demonstrated an active and exemplary leading role in this bond subscription. They not only subscribed quickly and exceeded the quota by a large margin, but also made timely payments. According to current statistics, the number of subscriptions by employees nationwide has reached 272.76 percent of the estimated number, with employees in East China, Northwest, and Inner Mongolia regions exceeding the estimated number by more than two times.

The number of subscriptions by the national armed forces exceeded the estimated number by nearly four times and has basically completed payments.

Farmers across the country also enthusiastically subscribed to the bonds. Due to the production season, the promotion of rural bonds was generally carried out after the spring plowing, so the time for farmers to subscribe to the bonds was very tight. However, as of now, national farmer subscriptions have exceeded the planned figures. The current cessation of bond subscriptions is very necessary for rural areas to concentrate their efforts on resisting natural disasters and striving for a bumper harvest.

Private industrialists and businessmen across the country also generally subscribed to the bonds enthusiastically, and also overfulfilled the estimated sales figures, but the payment progress was relatively slow.

Citizens in major and medium-sized cities across the country also showed enthusiastic participation in this bond subscription, and the payment progress was also better.

    国家经济建设公债认购工作胜利结束
    全国认购总额超过九万亿
    缴款总额已达认购总额的百分之六十六
    【新华社七日讯】一九五四年发行的国家经济建设公债，由于全国人民踊跃认购，发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，已经超额完成计划。截止七月二十四日的统计，全国人民认购总额已达九万二千亿元，超过原定公债发行计划六万亿元百分之五十三强。现中央人民政府财政部已根据政务院指示，通知全国各地在八月十日以后一律停止认购，宣布今年公债的认购工作胜利结束。
    公债缴款情况一般是良好的，但各地区进度并不一致。截至七月二十日止，全国公债缴款总额已达认购总额的百分之六十六点六。其中东北区已达百分之九十二点四一，华北区达百分之七十六点一九，内蒙古区达百分之七十五点二五，华东区达百分之六十八点三八，西南区达百分之五十六点九三，西北区达百分之五十点四四，中南区达百分之四十七点二二。为了圆满完成国家的发行公债计划，各地对于公债款仍须继续抓紧入库的工作。
    全国广大职员和工人，特别是武装部队，在这次认购公债中始终表现了积极的模范带头作用，他们不仅认购快，超额多，而且缴款及时。据现在统计，全国职工认购数字已达预计数字的百分之二七二点七六，其中华东、西北和内蒙古等地区的职工认购数都超过预计数字两倍以上。
    全国武装部队认购数超过预计数字将近四倍之多，并已基本上完成缴款。
    全国农民认购公债也极为踊跃。由于生产季节关系，农村公债推销工作多在春耕后才普遍开展，因而农村中认购公债的时间是很紧促的，但截至目前为止，全国农民认购已超过了预定计划数字。目前停止公债的认购工作，对农村集中力量抗御自然灾害，争取丰收是很必要的。
    全国私营工商业者对公债认购一般也很踊跃，也超额完成了预计推销数字，但缴款进度比较迟缓。
    各大、中城市的市民在这次认购公债中，也表现热烈积极，而且缴款进度也较好。
