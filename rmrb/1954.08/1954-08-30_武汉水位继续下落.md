Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 29th: At 5:00 PM on the 29th, the Changjiang (Yangtze River) water level at Wuhan Customs was 29.29 meters, a drop of 7 centimeters from the same time on the 28th, but still 1.01 meters higher than the highest water level in previous years. Since the water level at Wuhan Customs began to recede from 29.73 meters on the 19th, it has fallen by 42 centimeters in the past eleven days. On the 29th, the weather was clear along the Yangtze River from Lizhuang in Sichuan in the upper reaches to Jiangyin in Jiangsu in the lower reaches. In recent days, the flood peak coming from the upper reaches has continued to weaken after passing through the Three Gorges. Water levels are still falling in various places below Chenglingji.

　　From 8:00 PM on the 28th to 7:00 AM on the 29th, Wuhan experienced a whole night of Force 4 northeasterly winds. Since the end of the Limit of Heat season on the 24th, Wuhan has been experiencing Force 3 to Force 4 northerly and northeasterly winds every night for the past three or four days. Along the more than 100-kilometer dike line of the Yangtze River, Han River, and Zhanggong Dike north of Hankou, many previously remote areas now have electric lights illuminating the dikes all night long. Flood control teams inspecting the dikes are constantly checking for dangers and hidden troubles. On the Zhanggong Dike, a large team of dike patrol personnel received a red flag award from the Wuhan Municipal Flood Control Headquarters.

　　On the 29th, a group of willow dam (sao ba) technical workers from the Yellow River began constructing willow dams at the Wutai Sluice in Wuchang to ensure the safety of the Wutai Sluice under sustained high water levels. This is the first time that the excellent methods of fighting floods that have been passed down for many years in the Yellow River basin have been brought to the Yangtze River for application. Wuhan City has sent a group of young workers and technicians to Wutai Sluice to learn this experience of building willow dams.

    武汉水位继续下落
    【新华社武汉二十九日电】二十九日下午五时，武汉关长江水位为二九点二九公尺，比二十八日同一时间下落了七公分，比历年最高水位还高出一公尺零一公分。武汉关水位十九日从二九点七三公尺开始回落以后，十一天来已下落了四公寸二。二十九日，长江沿线从上游的四川李庄到下游江苏江阴，天气晴好。近日上游来的洪峰过三峡后，涨势继续减弱。城陵矶以下各地水位仍在下落。
    从二十八日晚八时到二十九日早晨七时，武汉又起了一整夜的四级东北风。自从二十四日过了处暑季节以后，近三、四天来，每天夜晚武汉都起三级到四级的北风和东北风。沿着长江、汉水和汉口北面的张公堤等一百多公里的堤防线上，许多过去很僻静的地方，现在都有电灯通宵照耀着堤防。巡查堤防的防汛队伍不间隙地查险情，找隐患。在张公堤上，有一个大队的巡堤人员得到武汉市防汛总指挥部的红旗奖励。
    二十九日，从黄河来的一批支援武汉防汛的埽坝技术工人，开始在武昌的武泰闸下埽筑坝，以确保武泰闸在持续的高水位下的安全。这是我国第一次把黄河流域多年流传下来的和洪水作斗争的好办法，带到长江来运用。武汉市已派了一批青年工人和技术人员，在武泰闸学习这一筑埽坝的经验。
