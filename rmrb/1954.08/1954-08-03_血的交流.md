The Exchange of Blood
Ruò Shuǐ

　　One - A Korean girl lay on a sickbed, injured by a bomb. Her face was pale, her eyes were without light, and her youthful life was nearing its end. In a coma, she heard the doctor say she needed a blood transfusion. Then, she saw a Volunteer soldier roll up his sleeve. Blood, fresh blood, irrigated her weakened body. … After regaining her health, whenever she spoke of this incident, her eyes always sparkled with tears:
　　“Chinese Volunteer soldiers’ blood flows in my veins. It is the blood of outstanding sons and daughters of a great nation. It is so noble and so pure. I don't know where he is now, but his blood continues to surge in my chest, giving me new life and new strength. From then on, I felt even more that the Chinese and Korean people are as close as blood relatives, because I can't distinguish in my veins which is my parents' blood and which is the Chinese's blood."

　　Two - A wounded Volunteer soldier lay in the ward. He was breathing rapidly, his mind was unclear, and death was about to take his brave life.
　　“Let me give him a blood transfusion, let me give him a blood transfusion!” He vaguely heard a Korean girl’s gentle voice. Blood, warm blood, permeated his withered life. … After recovering from his injuries, when talking about this girl, his voice always trembled with excitement:
　　“My mother's blood nurtured me; her blood saved me. When I think of her, I think of the fraternal Korean people, just as when I think of my mother, I think of my beloved motherland. I will always cherish the blood of this unknown girl. It possesses the noble qualities of a heroic nation. It instructs me to be loyal to our common sacred cause. This blood boils in my heart at all times, making me love and hate together with the Korean people, and making me fight even more bravely."

    血的交流
    若水一病床上躺着一个炸伤的朝鲜姑娘。她脸色苍白，眼睛没有光，青春的生命已经临近死亡。昏迷中她听见医生说要输血，接着她看见一个志愿军把袖子卷起。血，新鲜的血灌溉了她衰弱的身体。……恢复了健康的姑娘，每当向人谈起这件事，她的眼睛总是闪烁着泪光：
  “我的血管里流着中国志愿军的血，这是一个伟大民族的优秀儿女的血，它是那么高贵，那么纯洁。我不知道现在他在什么地方，但是他的血一直在我胸中激荡，它给了我新的生命，新的力量。从那以后，我更加感到中朝人民是亲骨肉，因为我分不清在我血管里流着的，哪是我父母的血，哪是中国人的血。二病房里躺着一个负伤的志愿军。他呼吸急促，神志不清，死亡快要夺去他勇敢的生命。
  “让我来输血吧，让我来输血吧！”他恍惚听见一个朝鲜姑娘的柔和声音。血，温暖的血浸润了他枯萎的生命。……养好了创伤的志愿军，在讲到这个姑娘的时候，他的声音总是激动得颤抖：
  “母亲的血孕育了我；她的血把我救活。我想起她就想起兄弟的朝鲜人民，正像想起母亲就想起亲爱的祖国。我永远珍惜这不知名的姑娘的血，它具有一个英雄民族的高尚素质，它嘱咐我忠于我们共同的神圣事业。这股血时时刻刻在我心中沸腾，使我和朝鲜人民一同爱，一同恨，使我更加勇敢地斗争。”
