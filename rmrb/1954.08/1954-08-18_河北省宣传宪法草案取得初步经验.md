Hebei Province Achieves Preliminary Experience in Publicizing the Draft Constitution

Hebei Province Draft Constitution Discussion Committee

Hebei Province has gained initial experience in publicizing and discussing the Draft Constitution. After the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, cadres in various agencies in Hebei Province generally studied and discussed it. By early August, most areas had completed the study and discussion of the Draft Constitution by cadres. In cities, factories, and mines, the Draft Constitution was also widely publicized and discussed among the people. In rural areas, the work of training key propagandists has largely been completed; and 114 counties are in the process of or have completed the universal training of propaganda teams. According to statistics from 75 counties and two special district-administered cities, more than 644,400 people have been trained. With the completion of the training of propaganda teams, publicity and discussion activities have been widely launched among the people in most areas.

The important key to carrying out the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution in various parts of Hebei Province is to strengthen political and ideological leadership. At the beginning, large-scale mobilization meetings were held in various places, with responsible cadres of the local Party and government making mobilization reports, so that most cadres corrected their attitudes and improved their enthusiasm for study. However, in the study and discussion activities, some cadres still lacked sufficient understanding, and a phenomenon of being unable to delve into the Draft Constitution occurred. In response to this situation, Xuanhua City, Shijiazhuang City, Tangshan Special District, and other places conducted mobilization again, explaining and criticizing various erroneous understandings and attitudes, and the situation was significantly changed. Qinhuangdao City conducted study mobilization and study summaries chapter by chapter during the learning and discussion process, which further ensured the gradual deepening of learning and discussion. Zhangjiakou City once convened more than 200 people, including theoretical study instructors, Party branch secretaries and propaganda committee members of agencies, and principals and political teachers of middle schools, and responsible cadres made answer reports on the issues raised in the study and discussion. In addition to the issues that could not be resolved locally being reported to the higher authorities for resolution, more than 80 other issues were answered. After the answer report, the enthusiasm of cadres for learning and discussion was further encouraged, and the in-depth study and discussion was also guaranteed. District cadres and cadres sent to the countryside have more scattered activities than centralized activities, so they have more difficulties in studying and discussing the Draft Constitution, but the study of these cadres is directly related to the universal publicity to farmers, so it is necessary to combine it with the promotion of various tasks at that time, and at the same time carry out the study of district cadres and cadres sent to the countryside. According to this principle, Changping, Pinggu, Feixiang, Shexian, Quzhou, Linzhang and other counties, taking the district as a unit, used the time when district cadres were concentrated to report to county cadres and study work, and county cadres simultaneously made study reports on the Draft Constitution. In Jize, Qiu County and other places, the reporters from the county directly made study reports to district cadres and cadres sent to the countryside at fixed study stations. In various counties and districts of Xingtai Special District, the district committees mostly used the opportunity of concentrating district cadres and cadres sent to the countryside to report and study work, and at the same time checked and arranged the study and discussion of the Draft Constitution. In various counties of Zhangjiakou Special District, during the production gaps, cadres sent to the countryside were concentrated to check and deploy work, and the study and discussion of the Draft Constitution was carried out intensively. Various places have adopted different specific methods to solve the problem of studying and discussing the Draft Constitution for district cadres and cadres sent to the countryside.

Before launching the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution to the people in a big way, Hebei Province seized the organization and training of reporters and propagandists. The organization of reporters, on the one hand, properly determined their reporting activities and tasks, so that they could carry out activities in a planned and prepared manner; on the other hand, unified the organization of their activities and the activities of propagandists. Baoding City, when determining the tasks of the reporter's activities, once determined the tasks of the reporter's activities in factories, schools, streets, business circles or religious circles according to the reporter's activity ability and the original nature of the reporter's work. In this way, it is convenient for the reporter's activities, it is also convenient for the reporter to contact reality when reporting, and it also combines the reporter's reporting activities with the original work. Baoding City has made unified arrangements for the activities of reporters and propagandists in advance; the areas and times of reporters' activities have also been notified to the relevant areas in advance, which ensures that the reporters' reporting activities are carried out in a planned and prepared manner. In order to improve the reporting ability of reporters, many areas have regarded the study and discussion of the Draft Constitution by reporters as one of the leadership focuses, and helped and guided them to specifically prepare reporting outlines. When the reporters in Baoding City started reporting activities, the responsible cadres of the municipal party committee first made a demonstration report, and organized more than 40 reporters to study the experience on the specific situation of the demonstration report, check the shortcomings, and put forward specific methods to improve the reporter's activities. These measures have played a great role in improving the reporter's activity ability and publicity effect. The training of propagandists, in cities and factories, is generally carried out directly by using three or five spare time units in streets and factories; in rural areas, most areas concentrate on training propaganda backbones, and then universally train propagandists. In rural areas, because production activities are very tight, the number of trainees has been appropriately reduced in various places when training propaganda backbones in a concentrated manner, and flexible and diverse methods have been adopted. According to statistics from 122 units, 87 counties were trained in a concentrated manner; 25 counties were trained in combination with three-level cadre meetings; during the county people's congress meetings, the propaganda backbones were absorbed to listen to the report on the Draft Constitution, and they were also organized to conduct discussions. After the meeting, the propaganda backbones continued to study and arrange the propaganda work. Ten counties adopted this method. In the process of universal training of propagandists, various places have also adopted many flexible and specific methods according to the production activities of local farmers. On sunny days, training is carried out in the evening or at noon; on rainy days, time is seized to carry out intensive training. Lecture in sections, discuss in sections; concentrate lectures, disperse discussions, etc. In short, think of various ways to intersperse the training and production of propagandists. When training propagandists in many cities and rural areas, they have adopted the method of training propagandists on the first day, and then propagandists publicizing to the masses or leading the masses to conduct discussions on the second day. Make the process of publicity and discussion also become the process of training propagandists. In this way, it not only solves the difficulty that the content of the Draft Constitution is rich and it is difficult for propagandists to fully accept it at one time, but also shortens the time for propagandists to be trained and carry out publicity and lead discussions every day, so as not to affect production.

To launch the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution in a big way, after all preparations are completed, the key to the decision is whether it can be closely combined with production and other work. For this problem, various parts of Hebei Province have taken many effective measures. In factories and mines, in addition to using workers' political lessons and part of the trade union activities to conduct discussions, some factories and mines also use other free time, or use the time to rest in the factory after work, to carry out publicity and discussion. In rural areas, various places mostly adopt flexible methods such as street meetings, residential group meetings, mutual aid group member meetings, agricultural production cooperative member meetings, family visits, and small-scale forums for publicity, and hold fewer mass meetings, and use evenings, noon, and time when it rains and cannot produce for publicity and discussion. Kangbao County has universally promoted the publicity methods of "three heads" (field head, kang head, street head) and "four points" (distributing streets, distributing areas, distributing households, distributing people), and adhered to the principles of coming quickly, opening quickly, and dispersing quickly at meetings. When Yang Shangtian, who led the agricultural production cooperative in Zucun Store, and Sun Xiuming, who led the mutual aid group in Dingxing County, went to the field to produce, they also brought publicity materials on the Draft Constitution and used the rest time in the field for publicity and discussion.

Through all possible meetings, implementing the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution is the main and effective method in many areas of Hebei Province, especially in rural areas, in promoting the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution this time. In areas where people's congress meetings were held after the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, the representatives carefully discussed the Draft Constitution during the meetings and made resolutions on supporting the Draft Constitution. After the discussion of the Draft Constitution, the representatives expressed that they would definitely publicize the Draft Constitution among the people and explain the great significance of formulating the Constitution to further improve the people's socialist consciousness. After the end of the People's Congress meeting in Huailai County, the leaders organized local cadres and propagandists to assist the representatives in making reports on the Draft Constitution to the masses, and the effect was very good. There are many meetings that can be used, such as three-level cadre meetings, youth, women and supply and marketing cooperative representative meetings, as well as other meetings with the participation of grassroots cadres or mass representatives. At these meetings, report on the main content of the Draft Constitution, and also explain the specific provisions of the Draft Constitution in a focused manner according to the nature of the meeting, and mobilize the people who participate in the meeting to return to their hometowns to publicize to the people. This method is not only convenient for the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution and the combination of current tasks, but also expands the publicity force.

The methods of Hebei Province to publicize and discuss the Draft Constitution in connection with reality: First, to connect with leadership and preparation. For example, the Wen'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China once formulated reference materials for publicizing the Draft Constitution based on the main content of the Draft Constitution and combined with the specific facts of the county, and provided them to the reporters for use. In some areas, when further publicity and discussion activities were launched, the leaders helped the reporters and propagandists to specifically determine the focus of contacting reality according to the reflections of the masses in the previous stage. After adopting these methods, the reporters and propagandists were specific and focused when conducting publicity, and at the same time avoided or reduced the confusion in publicity. Second, it is necessary to combine the comprehensive publicity of the main content of the Draft Constitution with the specific explanation of the provisions of the Draft Constitution with different focuses. Baoding Power Plant focused on mobilizing according to the provisions of the Draft Constitution that are directly related to the workers, especially Article 16 of the Draft Constitution, in the technical innovation movement, and as a result, greatly promoted the technical innovation movement. The Liu Yiheng and Shi Changdong team of the factory created an automatic door closer on the water tower; the Zhang Yonghe team unified the operating procedures and improved the furnace baffle, which reduced the coal consumption rate in June; and so on. Furthermore, use the things that the masses are familiar with to inspire the masses to recall and compare, so that the masses can educate themselves through their own personal experience. Workers, farmers and other working people mainly focus on the political, economic and cultural life before and after liberation, and recall and compare with the relevant provisions of the Draft Constitution; ethnic minorities focus on the provisions of the Draft Constitution related to ethnic policies, and recall and compare the ethnic relations and ethnic status before and after liberation. When the masses hate the old social system due to recollection, they are guided to recall the happy life since liberation, and further enlightened to realize that "the laws before liberation protect the interests of a few people," "Our Constitution is the weapon for the people to be the masters of their own affairs," "With the Constitution, we all do things according to the Constitution, and the socialist society will be built quickly," "If we want to protect our rights, we must fulfill our obligations." As a result, the masses improved their understanding of the Draft Constitution and improved their enthusiasm for socialist construction.

    河北省宣传宪法草案取得初步经验
    河北省宪法草案讨论委员会
    河北省开展宪法草案的宣传、讨论，已经取得了初步经验。宪法草案公布以后，河北省各机关干部普遍进行了学习、讨论。到八月上旬，多数地区的干部已经结束了宪法草案的学习和讨论。城市和工厂矿山，在人民群众中也普遍进行了宪法草案的宣传和讨论。在农村，训练宣传员骨干的工作大体已经结束；并有一百一十四个县正在进行或已经结束了普遍训练宣传队伍的工作。据七十五个县和两个专区代管市的统计，已经训练了六十四万四千四百多人。随着宣传队伍的训练结束，大部分地区在人民群众中已广泛地展开了宣传和讨论活动。
    河北省各地开展宪法草案的宣传、讨论的重要关键，是加强政治思想领导。开始时，各地都召开了大规模的动员大会，由当地党和行政的负责干部作动员报告，使大部分干部端正了态度，提高了学习的热情。但在学习和讨论活动中，仍然有一些干部缺乏足够的认识，对宪法草案产生了钻研不进去的现象。针对这种情况，宣化市、石家庄市、唐山专区等地，又再次进行了动员，对各种错误的认识和态度加以解释和批判，情况得到了明显的转变。秦皇岛市在学习和讨论过程中，逐章进行了学习动员和学习总结，更保证了学习和讨论的逐步深入。张家口市，曾经召集理论学习辅导员、机关党支部书记和宣传委员、中等学校校长和政治教员共二百多人，由负责干部就学习和讨论中提出的问题作解答报告。除了当地不能解决的问题报请上级解决以外，其余八十多个问题都作了解答。经过解答报告，进一步鼓舞了干部学习讨论的情绪，同时也保证了学习讨论的深入。区干部和下乡干部分散活动多于集中活动，所以他们学习和讨论宪法草案的困难比较多，但这些干部的学习又直接关系到对农民的普遍宣传，因此必须结合当地当时各种工作的推动，同时把区干部和下乡干部的学习开展起来。根据这个原则，昌平、平谷、肥乡、涉县、曲周、临漳等县，以区为单位，利用区干部集中向县干部汇报、研究工作的时间，由县里干部同时作关于宪法草案的学习报告。鸡泽、邱县等地，是由县里的报告员直接到固定的学习站向区干部和下乡干部作学习报告。邢台专区各县各区，多由区委利用区干部和下乡干部集中汇报、研究工作的机会，同时检查和安排宪法草案的学习和讨论。张家口专区各县，是在生产空隙，集中下乡干部检查和布置工作时，突击进行宪法草案的学习和讨论。各地都采取了不同的具体办法解决区干部和下乡干部对宪法草案的学习和讨论问题。
    河北省大张旗鼓地向人民群众展开宪法草案的宣传和讨论以前，抓紧组织、训练了报告员和宣传员。对报告员的组织工作，一方面妥善地确定他们的报告活动任务，使他们能有计划有准备地开展活动；另一方面把他们和宣传员的活动作统一的组织。保定市，在确定报告员活动的任务时，曾经根据报告员的活动能力和报告员原来的工作性质，分别确定报告员在工厂、学校、街道、工商界或宗教界活动的任务。这样，便于报告员的活动，也便于报告员进行报告时联系实际，并且使报告员的报告活动和原来的工作结合起来。保定市对报告员和宣传员的活动，事先都作了统一安排；报告员活动的地区和时间，也事先通知各有关地区，这保证了报告员的报告活动有计划、有准备地开展。为了提高报告员的报告活动能力，许多地区曾经把报告员的学习和讨论宪法草案作为领导重点之一，并帮助、指导他们具体准备报告提纲。保定市在报告员开始报告活动时，首先由市委负责干部作了示范报告，并组织四十多名报告员就示范报告的具体情况研究经验，检查缺点，提出改进报告员活动的具体办法。这些措施，对提高报告员活动能力和宣传效果，发挥了很大的作用。对宣传员的训练，在城市和厂矿中，一般是以街道、厂矿为单位利用三、五个业余时间，直接进行训练的；农村中，多数地区是集中训练宣传骨干，然后普遍训练宣传员。农村因为生产活动很紧张，集中训练宣传骨干时，各地都适当减少了受训的人数，并采取了灵活多样的办法。据一百二十二个单位统计，集中训练的八十七县；结合三级干部会议训练的二十五县；县人民代表大会会议期间，作关于宪法草案的报告时吸收宣传骨干旁听，也组织他们进行讨论，会后由宣传骨干继续研究、布置宣传工作，采取这种办法的有十县。在普遍训练宣传员的过程中，各地也曾经根据当地农民生产活动的情况，采取许多灵活具体的办法。晴天，利用晚上或中午进行训练；雨天，抓紧时间突击训练。分段讲课，分段讨论；集中讲课，分散讨论等等。总之，想各种办法使宣传员的训练和生产穿插进行。不少城市和农村训练宣传员时，曾经采取了第一天训练宣传员，第二天就由宣传员向群众宣传或领导群众进行讨论的方法。使宣传讨论的过程，也成为训练宣传员的过程。这样，既解决了宪法草案内容丰富、宣传员难于一时全面接受的困难，同时也缩短了宣传员每天受训和进行宣传、领导讨论的时间，不致影响生产。
    要大张旗鼓地展开宪法草案的宣传和讨论，在一切准备工作完成之后，决定的关键就是能否和生产及其他工作紧密地结合。对于这个问题，河北省各地都采取了许多有效的办法。在工厂矿山中，除了利用工人上政治课的时间和部分的工会活动时间进行讨论以外，有些工厂矿山并利用其他空隙时间，或利用下班后在厂内休息的时间，进行宣传、讨论。在农村，各地多采取街头会、居民小组会、互助组组员会、农业生产合作社社员会、家庭访问、小型座谈等灵活的方法进行宣传，少开群众大会，并且利用晚上、中午和下雨不能生产的时间进行宣传、讨论。康保县普遍推行了“三头”（地头、炕头、街头）和“四分”（分街、分片、分户、分人）的宣传方法，开会掌握快来、快开、快散的原则。定兴县祖村店杨尚田领导的农业生产合作社和孙秀明领导的互助组下地生产时，还带着关于宪法草案的宣传材料，利用地头休息时间进行宣传、讨论。
    通过一切可能利用的会议，贯彻宪法草案的宣传和讨论，是河北省许多地区特别是农村，在这次推动宪法草案的宣传、讨论过程中，主要的也是有效的方法。凡在宪法草案公布以后召开人民代表大会会议的地区，代表们在会议期间都认真讨论了宪法草案，并作出关于拥护宪法草案的决议。经过宪法草案的讨论，代表们纷纷表示，回去后一定在人民群众中宣传宪法草案，讲解制定宪法的重大意义，以进一步提高人民群众的社会主义觉悟。怀来县人民代表大会会议结束以后，领导上组织当地干部和宣传员协助代表向群众作关于宪法草案的传达报告，效果就很好。可以利用的会议还很多，如三级干部会，青年、妇女和供销合作社代表会，以及其他有基层干部参加或群众代表参加的会议。在这些会议上，报告宪法草案的主要内容，也根据会议的性质，分别有重点地解释宪法草案的具体条款，并动员参加开会的人回乡后向人民群众展开宣传。这种办法，既便于宪法草案的宣传讨论和当前各项工作的结合，又扩大了宣传力量。
    河北省各地联系实际宣传、讨论宪法草案的办法：首先是有领导有准备的联系。如中共文安县委会，曾经根据宪法草案的主要内容，结合本县具体事实拟定宣传宪法草案的参考材料，供给报告员使用。有的地区，当进一步展开宣传、讨论活动时，领导上就根据前一阶段群众的反映，帮助报告员、宣传员具体确定联系实际的重点。采取这些办法以后，报告员、宣传员进行宣传时，既具体又有重点，同时也避免了或减少了宣传中的混乱现象。其次，要使全面宣传宪法草案的主要内容和有分别有重点地具体解释宪法草案的条款互相结合起来。保定市发电厂在技术革新运动中，着重根据宪法草案中和工人有直接联系的条款特别是宪法草案第十六条进行动员，结果大大推动了技术革新运动。该厂刘义恒、史长东小组创造了水塔上的自动关门闸；张永合小组统一了操作规程，改进了炉道挡风板，使六月份煤耗率降低；等等。再就是利用群众熟悉的事情启发群众回忆对比，使群众通过自己的切身经验教育自己。工人、农民和其他劳动人民主要是围绕解放前后的政治、经济、文化生活情况，联系宪法草案的有关条款进行回忆对比；少数民族则着重联系宪法草案有关民族政策的条款，回忆对比解放前后的民族关系和民族地位。当群众由于回忆而痛恨旧的社会制度时，又引导群众回想解放以来的幸福生活，并进一步启发群众觉悟，避免把宪法草案的讨论形成单纯诉苦。在回忆对比的基础上，继续进行宪法草案的解释、讨论，群众自然而然觉悟到“解放以前的法律是保护少数人利益的”，“咱们的宪法是人民当家作主的武器”，“有了宪法，咱们大伙都按宪法办事，社会主义社会就建设的快了”，“要想保住咱们的权利，必须尽咱们的义务”。结果，群众提高了对宪法草案的认识，提高了社会主义建设的积极性。
