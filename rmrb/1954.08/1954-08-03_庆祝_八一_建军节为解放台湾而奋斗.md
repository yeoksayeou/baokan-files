Chinese People's Liberation Army units held various gatherings and commemorative activities to celebrate the 27th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day.

    Northeast Military Region Troops

    Many units of the Northeast Military Region held celebration meetings on the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, where the leaders of the units gave reports on the glorious history of the People's Liberation Army and the current tasks of the units. In the past few days, the leading organs, troops, and schools of the Northeast Military Region stationed in the Shenyang area have held joint celebrations and forums with local governments, factories, schools, and the people. The troops also sent representatives to participate in the commendation meetings for model military dependents and martyrs' families held in various districts of Shenyang. Troops stationed in major cities and villages in Northeast China also held joint celebrations with the local people. Some units invited model workers and farmers to report on the achievements of the motherland's economic construction, while others sent representatives and combat heroes to report to the people on the heroic deeds of the army in defending the motherland and building national defense.

    Commanders and soldiers of various units expressed their determination on the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day to celebrate this glorious festival with practical actions. A soldier from a certain unit said at a meeting of meritorious personnel: We will never allow American imperialism to continue to occupy our territory Taiwan and use the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang as a tool for aggression. We must speed up the modernization of our military and strive to liberate Taiwan, defend the security of the motherland, and safeguard peace in Asia!

    East China Military Region Troops

    The East China Military Region troops also commemorated the "August 1st" Army Day. The "People's Front" newspaper, published by the Political Department of the East China Military Region, published an editorial on August 1 entitled "Resolutely Undertake the Glorious Task of Liberating Taiwan." The editorial stated: The troops of the East China Military Region are at the forefront of national defense, facing Taiwan and Kinmen, and bear a major responsibility for liberating Taiwan and all enemy-occupied islands along the coast. Therefore, it is even more necessary to work hard to complete this task. Commanders and soldiers of the "Jinan First Regiment" of a certain unit wrote a letter to the leaders of the East China Military Region expressing their determination. The letter stated: In order to finally liberate our territory Taiwan, and to defend the security of the motherland and peace in Asia and the world, we are determined to step up military training, strive to learn advanced Soviet military science, continuously improve our combat effectiveness, strengthen organization and discipline, and continuously improve our socialist consciousness and enhance our fighting will. We will always keep a vigilant eye on the enemy's sinister plots.

    More than 100 representatives of the Youth League members stationed in Nanjing of the East China Military Region also went to Yuhuatai on July 31 to pay tribute to the revolutionary martyrs and lay wreaths. That evening, the Youth League members of the troops stationed in Nanjing gathered to commemorate the "August 1st" Army Day. On August 1, the Youth League members of the troops stationed in Nanjing and students from many schools in Nanjing held joint celebrations.

    Southwest Military Region Troops

    The directly affiliated organs of the Southwest Military Region and the troops stationed in Chongqing held a celebration meeting on July 31. At the celebration meeting held by the directly affiliated organs and troops of the Southwest Military Region, Wang Xinting, Deputy Political Commissar of the Southwest Military Region, gave a report on the current situation and the tasks of the army. In his report, Wang Xinting said: When we celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day this year, the Geneva Conference has reached an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina. This is an important development in the current international situation, and it is a great victory for the forces of world peace. However, American imperialism is still stepping up its efforts to create international tension, especially American imperialism is still occupying our territory Taiwan, and attempting to use the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang as a tool for aggression against our country. Therefore, eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and recovering our territory Taiwan is the most important task for the people of the whole country and the People's Liberation Army. In order to realize this glorious task, all commanders and soldiers must strive to learn from the experience of Soviet military construction, master modern weapons and complex military technology skillfully, and build the Chinese People's Liberation Army into a powerful modern national defense force to defend the motherland.

    Various organs and organizations in Chongqing also launched extensive activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to military dependents around the "August 1st" Army Day. Various districts also organized visits to the local garrison. On the evening of August 1, the Chongqing Labor People's Cultural Palace held a military-civilian get-together for more than 20,000 people.

    Central South Military Region Troops

    The organs, troops, and schools of the land, sea, and air forces under the Central South Military Region also warmly commemorated the 27th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day. According to the instructions of the Political Department of the Central South Military Region, various units conducted education on the situation and the glorious tasks of the People's Liberation Army. All commanders and soldiers have become more vigilant, stepped up training, strengthened combat readiness, and strived to liberate Taiwan and defend the security of the motherland. Many troops held joint celebrations with the masses in their garrison areas on the "August 1st" Army Day. Many coastal defense and border defense troops have also checked their mass discipline and further strengthened military-civilian unity. The troops stationed on a certain island also crossed the sea to neighboring islands to compete in basketball with fraternal units, and jointly held a commemorative evening for the 27th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day.

    东北军区许多部队都在“八一”建军节前夕召开了庆祝会，部队首长作了解放军光荣历史和部队当前任务的报告。驻在沈阳地区的东北军区领导机关和部队、学校，几天来，已分别和驻地政府、工厂、学校以及人民群众举行了联欢会、座谈会。部队还派遣代表参加了沈阳市各区召开的模范军属、烈属庆功大会。驻在东北各大城市和乡村的部队，也纷纷和驻地人民群众举行联欢。有的部队邀请了工农业劳动模范报告祖国经济建设的成就，有的派出代表和战斗英雄，向人民群众报告军队保卫祖国和建设国防的英雄事迹。
    各部队的指挥员、战斗员，在“八一”建军节前夕纷纷表示决心，要以实际行动庆祝这个光荣的节日。某部战士在功臣座谈会上说：我们绝不容许美帝国主义继续侵占我国领土台湾和利用蒋匪帮作为进行侵略的工具。我们一定要加紧现代化军事建设，为解放台湾、捍卫祖国安全和亚洲和平而奋斗！
    华东军区部队
    华东军区部队也分别纪念“八一”建军节。华东军区政治部出版的“人民前线”报在八月一日发表了题为“坚决把解放台湾的光荣任务担当起来”的社论。社论说：华东军区部队处在国防前线，面对着台湾、金门，对解放台湾和所有沿海敌占岛屿，负有重大的责任。因此，更加需要为完成这一任务而艰苦奋斗。某部“济南第一团”的指挥员、战斗员们，写信向华东军区首长表示决心。信中说：为最后解放我国领土台湾，为捍卫祖国的安全和亚洲与世界和平，我们决心加紧进行军事训练，努力学习苏联先进军事科学，不断地提高我们的战斗力，加强组织性、纪律性，并不断地提高我们的社会主义觉悟，增强战斗意志。我们将时刻睁着警惕的眼睛，注视着敌人的罪恶阴谋。
