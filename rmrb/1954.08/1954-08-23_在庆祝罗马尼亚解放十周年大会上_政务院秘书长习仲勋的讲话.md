Comrade Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

Tomorrow is the tenth anniversary of the glorious liberation of Romania by the Soviet army, a glorious and historically significant festival for the Romanian people who overthrew the Antonescu fascist dictatorship. Please allow me, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to extend warm brotherly greetings to the Government of the Romanian People's Republic and the Romanian people!

Ten years ago, due to the great victory of the Soviet Union in defeating the fascist German army, the Romanian people, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, overthrew the Antonescu fascist dictatorship, thus forever freeing themselves from the oppression and exploitation of foreign imperialism and domestic landlords and capitalists, embarking on the glorious path of people's democracy and socialism, and victoriously realizing the beautiful ideals for which the Romanian people had fought heroically for hundreds of years. The Chinese people wholeheartedly celebrate this great festival of the Romanian people.

Before liberation, the Romanian people suffered long-term brutal rule by the landlord bourgeoisie and the enslavement of foreign monopoly capital. Especially during the Second World War, the reactionary Antonescu fascist regime became a vassal of Hitler's Germany and participated in the heinous anti-Soviet war, thus plunging the Romanian people into deep disaster. During the war years, the Romanian people, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, united all genuine patriotic forces and waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against Antonescu's bloody rule and the occupation of the Nazi German army. On August 23, 1944, due to the victory achieved by the rapid offensive of the Soviet army on the Iasi-Kishinev front, the people's armed forces led by the Romanian Workers' Party arrested Antonescu, overthrew the fascist government, and cooperated with the Soviet army to strike at the fascist German army, and then fought together with the Soviet army for the liberation of Transylvania and the liberation of Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

Comrades, the liberation of Romania is a historically significant and great victory for the Romanian working people, and also a major victory for the working people of the world in their struggle for democracy, freedom, and socialism. This marks the weakening of the world imperialist system and the strengthening of the forces of peace and democracy. We, the Chinese people and the progressive people of the world, warmly and unanimously hail the great victory of the Romanian people.

Over the past ten years, the Romanian people, under the leadership of the long-tested Romanian Workers' Party headed by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, have achieved tremendous successes in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture through arduous and complex struggles and glorious labor.

In the early days of liberation, the Romanian people faced economic destruction brought about by the war, drought, capitalist sabotage, inflation, and the conspiratorial activities of domestic and foreign class enemies attempting to steal the fruits of the people's victory. The Romanian working people waged an arduous and complex struggle to overcome all these disasters and the sabotage of domestic reactionary forces, and finally, in the new elections at the end of 1946, the democratic forces gained an absolute advantage in the government; and at the end of 1947, they abolished the monarchy that had weighed on the people's heads for centuries, expelled the last feudal tyrant of Romania, Mihai, and announced the establishment of the Romanian People's Republic, placing state power completely in the hands of the working people. Before and after this period, the Romanian government implemented a series of democratic reforms nationwide, such as the nationalization of major economic sectors such as industry, banking, and transportation, as well as land reform and currency reform. Because Romania thoroughly deprived the bourgeoisie and landlords of their ruling position politically and economically, rapidly healed the wounds of war, restored the national economy, realized the unity of the working-class party, and consolidated the people's democratic regime based on the worker-peasant alliance, this created the prerequisites for further developing the national economy and carrying out socialist construction in a planned way.

Since the implementation of the plan for building a socialist national economy in Romania, it has been transforming from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country. The existing industrial output has far exceeded the highest pre-war level. The total industrial production in 1953 was about three times that of 1938. The heavy industry newly established under the people's democratic regime, especially the machine-building industry, is growing rapidly. Before liberation, the machines and equipment needed by large and small factories in Romania had to be imported from foreign countries for the most part. Now, the machines and equipment needed for industry and agriculture can not only be largely self-sufficient, but also export some products. The petroleum industry has achieved special development. In 1953, crude oil production was more than 9 million tons, reaching the highest level in history. Coal mining was about two and a half times that of 1938, and steel smelting was four times that. The national electrification cause is developing smoothly. Today, the entire Romania is enthusiastically and intensively engaged in huge socialist construction. The huge socialist construction projects such as the Bicaz-Lenin Hydropower Station and the I.V. Stalin Printing Plant are being established. The formerly backward Moldavian region is now changing its face with the construction of huge steel centers, giant oil fields, and textile mills.

The tremendous achievements of Romania's socialist industrialization and the development of heavy industry have created favorable conditions for further developing the national economy and improving the welfare of the working people.

Last August, the enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party decided to vigorously increase agricultural production and rapidly increase the production of consumer goods in order to continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people in urban and rural areas.

The Romanian Workers' Party and the government are taking a series of measures to improve agricultural production, transforming it from the backward state under the old regime into a modern, mechanized agriculture based on advanced agricultural technology. At present, about 300,000 laboring farmers have formed more than 4,300 collective farms and mutual aid teams based on voluntary principles. There are 220 machine tractor stations across the country, with 23,300 general-purpose tractors of 15 horsepower serving the farmers nationwide. In the first half of this year, tractor stations and state farms received more than 1,500 tractors and many other agricultural machines. The victorious realization of these new measures in economic construction has further strengthened and consolidated the alliance between the working class and the laboring farmers and the people's democratic system.

The living standards of the Romanian working people are constantly improving, unemployment has been eliminated, and the people enjoy the rights to vacation, healthcare, and education. The Romanian government has allocated huge amounts of funds to build schools, cultural institutions, theaters, cinemas, and stadiums. The number of students is growing rapidly. Excellent literature, art, and science are flourishing.

On their beautiful homeland with abundant resources, the brave and hardworking Romanian people, under the strong leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party and with the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, are advancing steadily towards the victory of socialism with high patriotic enthusiasm and creative labor, full of confidence.

The Romanian people love peace, and they actively promote a policy of peaceful and friendly cooperation with the people of all countries to safeguard and consolidate lasting world peace. Their brilliant labor has made important contributions to consolidating and developing the forces of peace and democracy.

The people of China and Romania had sincere friendship of mutual sympathy and support long before the liberation of our two countries, at a time when we were both in difficult struggles. Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the leader of the Romanian people, led his fellow prisoners in celebrating the victory of the Chinese Red Army's Long March in fascist prisons. The victory of August 23 also inspired the Chinese people who were fighting in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Therefore, we feel close and happy about every achievement of the Romanian people.

The founding of the People's Republic of China and the Romanian People's Republic has opened a new era in the friendly relations between the people of China and Romania. Over the past five years, the friendly and cooperative relations between the people of the two countries have greatly developed. Through the signing of cultural, trade, and scientific and technological agreements between the two countries, cooperation and mutual assistance in various aspects have been strengthened in a planned way. The trade volume between the two countries has gradually increased. In terms of scientific and technological cooperation, it should be particularly pointed out that the advanced technology of the Romanian petroleum industry has helped the development of China's petroleum industry. Cultural exchanges are also becoming more frequent and extensive. Through mutual visits of various delegations, mutual exhibitions, and the introduction of a large number of books and periodicals, the mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries have been greatly enhanced. Our friendly cooperation in all aspects has promoted the socialist construction of the two countries, gradually realizing the common progress and common economic upsurge, and is of great significance for strengthening the world peace forces headed by the Soviet Union.

The achievements made at the Geneva Conference will promote all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world to continue to make unremitting efforts to maintain peace and prevent war.

Comrades! On this solemn, glorious, and happy festival, please allow me, in the name of the Chinese people, to wish the Romanian people new and greater victories in the great cause of further consolidating the people's democratic system, developing the national economy, vigorously improving the welfare of the working people, and building socialism!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between China and Romania!

Long live the unity of the forces of peace headed by the Soviet Union!

    在庆祝罗马尼亚解放十周年大会上
    政务院秘书长习仲勋的讲话大使大使同志、各位同志、各位朋友：
    明天是光荣的苏联军队解放罗马尼亚十周年纪念日，是罗马尼亚人民推翻安东尼斯库法西斯专政的具有历史意义的光辉的节日，请允许我以中华人民共和国中央人民政府和中国人民的名义，向罗马尼亚人民共和国政府和罗马尼亚人民致以热烈的兄弟的敬礼！
    十年前的这一天，由于苏联战胜法西斯德国军队的伟大胜利，罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党领导下推翻了安东尼斯库法西斯独裁制度，从而永远摆脱了外国帝国主义和国内地主、资本家的压迫和剥削，走上人民民主和社会主义的光辉大道，胜利地实现了罗马尼亚人民上百年来英勇斗争所争取的美好的理想。中国人民衷心地庆贺罗马尼亚人民这一伟大的节日。
    解放以前的罗马尼亚人民长期受着地主资产阶级的残酷统治与外国垄断资本的奴役。特别是在第二次世界大战期间，反动的安东尼斯库法西斯政权变成了希特勒德国的附庸，并参加了罪恶的反苏战争，因而使罗马尼亚人民陷入深重的灾难之中。在战争的年代里罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，团结一切真正的爱国力量，为反对安东尼斯库的血腥统治和纳粹德军的占领进行了英勇顽强的斗争。一九四四年八月二十三日，由于苏军在雅西——基什纽前线迅速进攻所取得的胜利，罗马尼亚工人党领导的人民武装逮捕了安东尼斯库，推翻了法西斯政府，并配合苏军打击法西斯德军，接着就和苏联军队一起为解放德兰斯瓦尼亚以及解放捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利而战斗。
    同志们：罗马尼亚的解放是罗马尼亚劳动人民具有历史意义的伟大的胜利，也是全世界劳动人民为争取民主自由和社会主义的一个重大胜利。这标志着世界帝国主义体系的削弱和和平民主力量的加强。我们中国人民和全世界进步人类热烈地同声欢呼罗马尼亚人民的伟大胜利。
    十年来，罗马尼亚人民在久经考验的、以格奥尔基·乔治乌—德治同志为首的罗马尼亚工人党领导下经过艰苦复杂的斗争和光辉的劳动，在政治、经济、文化各方面都获得了巨大的成就。
    在解放初期，罗马尼亚人民面临着战争所带来的经济破坏、旱灾、资本家的怠工、通货膨胀，以及国内外阶级敌人企图窃取人民胜利果实的阴谋活动。罗马尼亚劳动人民为战胜这一切灾难和国内反动势力的破坏，曾经进行了艰苦复杂的斗争，终于在一九四六年底的新选举时，民主势力在政府中获得了绝对的优势；并在一九四七年底废除了几世纪来压在人民头上的君主制度，驱逐了罗马尼亚最后的一个封建暴君——米哈依，宣告了罗马尼亚人民共和国的成立，使国家政权完全掌握在劳动人民手中。在这一时期的前后，罗马尼亚政府在全国范围内实行了一系列的民主改革，如工业、银行、运输业等主要经济部门的国有化和土地改革、币制改革等。由于罗马尼亚从政治上与经济上彻底剥夺了资产阶级、地主的统治地位，迅速地医治了战争的创伤，恢复了国民经济，实现了工人阶级政党的统一，巩固了以工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权，这就为进一步发展国民经济和为有计划地进行社会主义建设创造了前提。
    罗马尼亚自从建设社会主义国民经济计划实施以来，正从一个落后的农业国变为一个先进的社会主义的工业国家。现有的工业产量已远超过战前的最高水平。一九五三年的工业生产总量约为一九三八年的三倍。在人民民主政权下新建立的重工业，特别是机器制造业正迅速成长。解放以前，罗马尼亚大小工厂所需的机器和装备绝大部分都要从外国输入，而现在工农业所需的机器和装备不仅能大部分自给，而且还能出口一部分产品，石油工业获得特别的发展。在一九五三年，原油的产量为九百多万吨，达到历史上的最高水平。煤的开采量约为一九三八年的二倍半，钢的熔炼量是四倍。国家电气化事业正在顺利地发展。今天整个罗马尼亚都在热烈地紧张地进行巨大的社会主义建设。贝卡兹列宁水电站和约·维·斯大林印刷厂等庞大的社会主义建设工程正在建立起来。过去落后的摩尔多瓦地区现在随着巨大钢铁中心、巨型油田和纺织厂的建设而改变着面貌。
    罗马尼亚社会主义工业化的巨大成就，重工业的发展，为进一步发展国民经济和提高劳动人民的福利创造了良好条件。
    去年八月，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会扩大全体会议决定要大力提高农业生产和迅速增加消费品的生产，以不断改善城乡劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平。
    罗马尼亚工人党和政府正采取一系列的措施，致力于提高农业生产，使其从旧政权下所处的落后状态转变为基于先进的农业技术的现代化机械化的农业。目前已约有三十万户的劳动农民根据自愿原则组成了四千三百多个集体农庄和共耕互助社。全国已有二百二十个机器拖拉机站，拥有二万三千三百部十五匹马力的供一般使用的拖拉机为全国农民服务。今年上半年，拖拉机站和国营农场又获得了一千五百多部拖拉机，以及许多其他农业机器。这些经济建设上的新措施的胜利实现，使工人阶级与劳动农民的联盟和人民民主制度获得进一步的加强和巩固。
    罗马尼亚劳动人民的生活水平正在不断提高，失业现象已经消除，人民享受着休假、保健以及受教育的权利。罗马尼亚政府拨了巨额的资金建造学校、文化机构、剧院、电影院、体育场。学生人数在迅速增长。优秀的文学、艺术和科学正在欣欣向荣地发展。
    在自己拥有丰富资源的美丽的国土上，勇敢勤劳的罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党的坚强领导下，在伟大的苏联的无私援助下，正以高度的爱国热忱和创造性劳动，满怀信心地稳步地向着社会主义的胜利前进。
    罗马尼亚人民热爱和平，他们积极推行与各国人民和平友好合作的政策，维护和巩固世界的持久和平。他们的光辉劳动已经为巩固与发展和平民主力量作了重要的贡献。
    中罗两国人民远在两国人民解放之前，正当彼此都处于艰苦斗争的时期，就有了相互同情、相互支持的真诚友谊。罗马尼亚人民的领袖格奥尔基·乔治乌—德治同志在法西斯的监狱里即领导过难友们庆祝中国红军长征的胜利。八月二十三日的胜利，也曾鼓舞了正在抗日战争中的中国人民。因此，我们对罗马尼亚人民每一成就都感到亲切和高兴。
    中华人民共和国和罗马尼亚人民共和国的成立为中罗两国人民的友谊关系开辟了新的纪元。五年以来，两国人民的友好合作关系有了很大的发展。通过两国文化、贸易与科学技术等协定的签订，使两国在各方面的合作互助有计划地日益加强。两国的贸易额已逐步增长。在科学与技术合作方面，应该特别提出的是罗马尼亚石油工业方面的先进技术帮助了中国石油工业的发展。文化交流也日益频繁和广泛。通过各种代表团的互相访问和展览会的互相展出和大批书刊的介绍，大大地增进了两国人民的相互了解和友谊。我们之间的各方面友好合作，推进了两国社会主义的建设，逐步地实现着共同进步和共同经济高涨的愿望，并且是对加强以苏联为首的世界和平力量具有重大的意义的。
    日内瓦会议所获得的成就将推动着世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民继续不懈地为维护和平和制止战争而更加努力。
    同志们！在这个隆重的、光荣的、快乐的节日里，请允许我以中国人民的名义祝罗马尼亚人民在进一步巩固人民民主制度、发展国民经济、大力提高劳动人民的福利和建设社会主义的伟大事业中获得新的更大的胜利！
    中罗两国牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平力量的团结万岁！
