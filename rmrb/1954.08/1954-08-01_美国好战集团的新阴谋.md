    The U.S. attempt to sabotage the Indochina armistice has failed. However, it has not learned a lesson from its failure. On July 23, Dulles issued a statement saying, "From now on, the important thing is not to mourn the past, but to seize future opportunities." What to do by "seizing future opportunities"? He said without concealment that the U.S. would step up its efforts to put together a Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and as a "long-term" plan, it would also include Taiwan in this aggressive bloc. In addition, according to the "New York Times," Dulles also believes that the current "best way is for the U.S. and the Kuomintang to sign a common security treaty similar to the one signed with South Korea."
    In fact, Dulles' conspiracy to sign a military treaty between the U.S. and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits is being intensified. For several months, U.S. senior officials such as Wilson and Van Fleet have been visiting Taiwan one after another like a revolving lantern. What exactly did they do? According to U.S. Ambassador to Taiwan Rankin, they are working hard for this military treaty.
    Along with these conspiratorial activities, the U.S. warmongers' clamor of hostility towards our country has become more and more frequent. According to the "Washington Post" on June 9, Van Fleet advocated "supporting the Chinese Kuomintang's attack on the mainland" at a secret meeting of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. U.S. Tactical Air Force Commander Weyland also clamored on July 19 that Taiwan is "the closest place" to attack the Chinese mainland. According to the "New York Times" on July 27, U.S. Republican leaders advocated that if the Chinese people want to liberate Taiwan, the U.S. government should immediately send armed forces to obstruct it. Along with these clamors, the provocations of U.S. imperialism against China have become even more frantic. The fact that U.S. fighter planes broke into the airspace over Hainan Island and shot down two of our patrol planes on July 26 is the best proof of the U.S.'s frantic provocation.
    In early May of this year, when New York stock prices rose, U.S. economist Babson said, "The reason for the high stock prices is that Wall Street believes that we (the U.S.) will lead a war against China." He also said that if the Far East issue is resolved through negotiation, stock prices will fall. The facts are so obvious that in order to continue to maintain their high bloody profits, the Wall Street bosses have to maintain and create international tension at all times. When the Korean War was forced to stop, it stepped up its activities to expand the Indochina War. Now that the Indochina War has stopped, it is stepping up its efforts to put together a Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and it wants to make it a "long-term" plan in its creation of international tension.
    In this conspiratorial activity, what must attract our attention is that U.S. imperialism wants to occupy our territory Taiwan for a long time, to support the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to attack our mainland, and to sign some kind of "common security bilateral treaty" with the remnants of Taiwan. In a word, U.S. imperialism intends to hold on tightly to the political corpse of Chiang Kai-shek and refuse to let go, in order to oppose the Chinese people for a long time, threaten China's security, and undermine peace in the Far East and the world. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. Taiwan has been an integral part of China's sacred territory since ancient times, and the liberation of Taiwan is a part of the Chinese people's entire liberation cause. Therefore, we must liberate Taiwan to complete the unfinished business of the people's liberation war and to guarantee the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty.
    There is a Chinese folk song that says: "You reap what you sow; whoever sows hatred will suffer the consequences!" This folk song is very appropriate to give to the Dulles gang. Warmongers who are hostile to the Chinese people should understand the meaning of this folk song: a disastrous end is waiting for them; whoever dares to invade the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China will surely suffer!

    美国好战集团的新阴谋
    未艾
    美国破坏印度支那停战的阴谋失败了。然而，它却并没有从失败中取得教训。七月二十三日杜勒斯发表声明说：“从现在起，重要的问题是不要悲伤过去，而要抓住未来的机会”。“抓住未来的机会”干什么呢？他毫不掩饰地说，美国要加紧拼凑东南亚侵略集团，而且作为“长久的”打算，也要把台湾包括进这个侵略集团中去。另外，据“纽约时报”透露说，杜勒斯并且认为，目前“最好的办法是由美国和国民党签订一项类似和南朝鲜所签订的共同安全条约。”
    事实上，杜勒斯所说的美蒋匪帮签订军事条约的阴谋正在加紧进行中。几个月来，像走马灯一样，美国的高级官员威尔逊、范佛里特等人接二连三地到台湾进行“访问”，他们究竟干了些什么？据美国驻台湾“大使”兰金承认，他们正是为了这个军事条约而奔忙。
    伴随着这些阴谋活动，美国的好战分子敌视我国的叫嚣也越来越多了。据六月九日“华盛顿邮报”透露，范佛里特在美国参议院外交委员会的秘密会议上，主张“支持中国国民党进攻大陆”。美国战术空军司令威兰在七月十九日也叫嚣，台湾是攻击中国大陆的“最近的一个地方”。据七月二十七日
  “纽约时报”说，美国共和党领袖们主张，如果中国人民要解放台湾，美国政府就立即派遣武装部队去阻挠。随着这些叫嚣美帝国主义对中国的挑衅也更加疯狂起来了，七月二十六日，美国战斗机闯入我国海南岛上空并且击落我两架巡逻机的事实，就是美国疯狂挑衅的最好证明。
    今年五月初，纽约股票价格上涨时，据美国经济学家白布逊说，“股票价格高的原因，是因为华尔街认为：我们（美国）将领导反对中国的战争”。他并且说，如果以协商的方法解决远东问题，股票价格就会下跌。事实已经如此明显，华尔街的老板们为了继续维持他们高额的血腥利润，就不得不时时刻刻维持和制造国际紧张局势。朝鲜战争被迫停止了，它就加紧扩大印度支那战争的活动，印度支那战争现在停止了，它就加紧拼凑东南亚侵略集团的活动，而且要作为它制造国际紧张局势中的“长久的”打算。
    在这个阴谋活动中，必须引起我们注意的是，美帝国主义要长期侵占我国的领土台湾，要支持残余蒋匪进攻我国大陆，还准备和台湾残匪签订什么“共同安全双边条约”，一句话，美帝国主义打算紧紧抱住蒋介石这付政治僵尸不放，来长期反对中国人民，威胁中国的安全，破坏远东和世界的和平。这是中国人民绝对无法容忍的。台湾自古是中国神圣领土的一部分，解放台湾是中国整个人民解放事业的一部分，因此我们一定要解放台湾，来完成人民解放战争的未竟事业，来保证中国领土主权的完整。
    中国有个歌谣说：“种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆，谁种下仇恨自己遭殃！”这个歌谣奉送给杜勒斯之流应该说是非常适当的。敌视中国人民的好战分子应该懂得这个歌谣的意义：失败的下场正在等待着他们，谁要胆敢侵犯中华人民共和国的神圣领土，他们一定要遭殃的！
