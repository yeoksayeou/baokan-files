    Strive to Run Every Agricultural Production Cooperative Well
    Calculate Whether Cooperative Members Can Increase Their Income This Year
    Rural Work Department of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Editor's Note: Running existing agricultural production cooperatives well can not only mobilize all farmers to strive to complete the state's agricultural production plan, but also has extremely important significance for further developing the cooperative movement. What is the situation of the existing agricultural production cooperatives in our country? According to recent reports from various regions, about 30 percent are doing well in production, management, and organizational consolidation; those with poor production work, relatively chaotic management, and unsolidified organizations account for about 10 percent in general areas, and some even account for more than 10 percent or even 20 percent; the intermediate state accounts for about 50 to 60 percent. If the poorly run cooperatives, which account for more than 10 percent of the total number of existing cooperatives, are not vigorously improved, there is a possibility of reduced production. Although they do not account for the majority, their impact on the entire rural production and cooperative movement is not small. The cooperatives in the intermediate state, which account for more than 50 percent of the total number of existing cooperatives, also have some internal problems and urgently need to be improved. The central issue in running the existing cooperatives well is to help these cooperatives do a good job in production, give full play to the potential of labor and land, and ensure increased production. Now, the leadership in some regions has strengthened specific leadership over backward cooperatives and has grasped the important links to increase production; some have begun to change the face of backward cooperatives. On the other hand, some leading cadres still blindly believe that "the problem is not big"; and some cadres have lost confidence in the face of difficulties, believing that "it is inevitable that some cooperatives will collapse." For this reason, this newspaper published an editorial on August 3 entitled "Further Help All Agricultural Production Cooperatives to Do a Good Job in Production"; now, the situation on this issue and the methods used by some regions to solve this problem are published in a concentrated manner, hoping that everyone will pay close attention to this problem and earnestly solve it, striving for each cooperative to increase production and consolidate.

    Recently, many agricultural production cooperatives in the Southwest region have conducted a more serious trial calculation of the autumn harvest distribution. According to the trial calculation results of some typical cooperatives, if no unexpected disasters are encountered this year and the production increase plan is completed, the income of the vast majority of cooperative members will increase, and some members with strong labor but little land may even increase their income by one or two times compared with before joining the cooperative. Through trial calculation, each member understands how much the entire cooperative can increase production, how much they can share, and why they can share more, which has a great effect on improving members' understanding and labor enthusiasm. Some cooperative members said: "In the past, I only knew that the cooperative could increase production, but I didn't know exactly how much it could increase; I also suspected that even if the cooperative could increase production, I might not be able to share more. This calculation made me feel clear." They all expressed that they would work harder in production. Some people who did not come out to work much in the past also came out to work.

    However, due to the different original production levels, the disparity in labor and technology, and some other reasons (such as some members who were originally small merchants, handicraft workers, or had other income, and cadres who earned fewer points due to work delays), the income of about 5 to 20 percent of the cooperative members' households may be less than before joining the cooperative. According to the trial calculation of the Jiefang Cooperative in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, even after completing the production increase plan, 17 out of 117 households would still have reduced income. The situation of these 17 households is: 4 households with originally high yields, 7 households with more land but less labor and lack of labor, and 6 households with other special income (1 fruit farmer, 5 vegetable farmers). In the Xinsheng and Shuguang cooperatives in Longchang County, Sichuan Province, out of a total of 90 households, the trial calculation results showed that 18 households, or 20 percent of the households, may have reduced income. These included 8 households with weak labor and poor technology, 6 households with good land, high yields, large populations, and little labor, and 4 households of cadres and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. In previous years, these households mostly hired some odd jobs or exchanged cattle work for manual work, or mobilized the whole family, relatives, and neighbors to help, or rented out the land and did some other work themselves, plus operating some sideline businesses, their income was still considerable; after joining the cooperative, although it solved their difficulties such as lack of labor, or lack of draught animals and farm tools, or lack of fertilizer, or poor production technology, because the cooperative implements the distribution principle based on labor, the income from land is relatively reduced, and their income is reduced.

    After trial calculation, it is estimated that for households whose income may be reduced by 5 or 10 percent less than in previous years, as long as they pay appropriate attention to labor allocation in the future, so that they have the opportunity to earn more work points, it can be largely solved. For those with a large reduction in income, it is not enough to take care of them solely from labor allocation. Because they are emotionally uneasy, some are watching the autumn harvest, some are planning to withdraw from the cooperative, some are relying on government relief, and some cadres or activists have difficulty speaking and are blamed by their families. Their unstable emotions affect other cooperative members and the masses outside the cooperative. Therefore, distribution trial calculation is not a simple accounting, but a careful ideological education work and organizational work. Many cooperatives, on the one hand, through the possibility of increasing income for the majority of households, make members recognize the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives and enhance members' confidence in running the cooperative well. On the other hand, they analyze the reasons for the possible reduction in income for households that may have reduced income to the members. In particular, it is emphasized that many households in difficulty have reduced many of their past difficulties (such as not being able to hire workers, not being able to rent draught cattle, resulting in paying more wages, or having to delay the season and reduce production, etc.) with the help of the collective strength of the cooperative after joining the cooperative, and their lives and production are becoming more and more stable; and with the development of agricultural production cooperatives and the increasing strength of the collective, this kind of difficulty will become less and less, and they will gradually become prosperous together with everyone. Make them see the prospect of socialism and actively and enthusiastically support agricultural production cooperatives. While carrying out these educations, they also actively take necessary measures to ensure that households that are expected to increase income can indeed increase income, and that members who may have reduced income can also increase income.

    The methods used by various cooperatives to solve this problem are, first of all, to seize the key to increasing production, adopt new technologies, prevent or overcome possible natural disasters, and ensure the completion and over-completion of the cooperative's production increase plan. According to the inference of the Jiefang Cooperative, if the production increase plan can be over-completed, half of the households that are expected to reduce income can be changed to increase income. The Wuxing Cooperative in Suining County expanded the cultivated land area by 21 mu by using some unused field ridges and corners, and the grain produced is enough for 15 people to eat for a year, and the income of the whole cooperative has increased. The income of cooperative members is also guaranteed.

    Secondly, it is to develop the collective sideline business of the cooperative and the family sideline business of the members, and help the members solve some difficulties in engaging in sideline production. For example, more than 20 households in the Jiefang Cooperative wanted to raise pigs, but they lacked feed and capital. The cooperative borrowed money from the People's Bank to buy more than 60 pigs and sheep and distributed them to them for raising. It also distributed all the pea leaves, broad bean leaves, vegetable roots and leaves, sweet potato vines, corn leaves, etc. that can be used as feed in the whole cooperative to the members who need feed in exchange for pig manure, which not only increased the source of fertilizer for the cooperative, but also increased the income of the members.

    Third, in organizing production, by rationally organizing the use of labor, consciously organize the labor of households that may have reduced income to engage in agricultural and sideline production, so as to give them as many opportunities as possible to earn work points. However, when taking care of these households, we should do a good job in planning and education, proceed from the benefit of production, and prevent the bias of taking care of them for the sake of taking care of them, such as assigning some work that they cannot do well, which will affect production and unity (such as some members who cannot feed cattle, assigning them to feed cattle in order to take care of them, resulting in damage to the cattle, etc.). At the same time, it is necessary to educate all members, explain the great significance of taking care of them to consolidate the cooperative and achieve the goal of common prosperity, and overcome the jealousy and egalitarianism of some members.

    Fourth, different methods are adopted for some special circumstances that reduce income, such as the Jiefang Cooperative adopting the method of "contracting work and contracting production, sharing bonuses for overproduction" for vegetable farmers and fruit farmers, so that the income of these households is not reduced. For cadres who delay work too much, the main focus is on improving leadership style and working methods, reducing some unnecessary meetings, so that they have time to participate in production. For some handicraft workers, they are allowed to go out to do some work to increase income under the principle of not affecting the production of the cooperative. Of the 18 households in the Xinsheng and other two cooperatives in Longchang that may have reduced production, 6 households were solved by rationally allocating labor, and the other 3 households were weaving summer cloth, and 3 households were raising draught cattle, and 6 households were raising pigs, sheep, and geese for the cooperative. After these measures, households with reduced income may generally increase income, or not reduce income. Although the income of some households has been reduced, the expenditure has also been reduced, such as the need to pay wages and food expenses for hiring workers in previous years, which is no longer needed now. The cooperatives also explained the situation to these households separately, stabilizing their emotions.

    After the trial calculation, the cooperatives that have done a good job in ideological education and organizational work have improved the confidence of cooperative cadres and members in running the cooperative well, strengthened the unity of middle peasants and poor peasants within the cooperative, and further consolidated agricultural production cooperatives.

    争取把每一个农业生产合作社都办好
    算一算社员们今年能不能增加收入
    中共中央西南局农村工作部
    编者按：办好现有的农业生产合作社，不但可以带动全体农民为完成国家的农业生产计划而斗争，并且对于进一步开展合作化运动有极其重要的意义。我国现有的农业生产合作社的情况是怎样的呢？根据各个地区最近反映的情况，生产好、经营管理好、组织巩固的，大约占百分之三十；生产工作做得很不好、经营管理比较混乱、组织不巩固的，在一般地区大约占百分之十，也有占百分之十以上以至百分之二十的；中间状态的约占百分之五十到六十。占现有社总数百分之十以上的办得不好的社，如果不大力加以改进，就有减产的可能；它们虽然不占多数，但对于整个农村的生产和合作化运动的影响却是不小的。占现有社总数百分之五十以上的中间状态的社，内部也存在着一些问题，也迫切需要加以改进。办好现有的社的中心问题，就是帮助这些社做好生产工作，充分发挥劳动力和土地的潜在能力，保证增加生产。现在，有些地区领导方面已经加强了对落后社的具体领导，而且抓住了增产的重要环节；有的已经开始改变了落后社的面貌。另一方面，有些地区的领导干部却仍然盲目地认为“问题不大”；还有一些干部在碰到困难的情况下失去了信心，认为“有一些社办垮是不可避免的”。为此，本报已于八月三日发表题为“进一步帮助所有农业生产合作社做好生产工作”的社论；现在，再把关于这个问题的情况和一些地区解决这个问题的办法集中发表，希望大家密切地注意这个问题，切实地加以解决，争取每个社都能增加生产，都能巩固起来。
    最近，西南地区许多农业生产合作社，都较认真地进行了一次秋收分配试算工作。根据一些典型社试算结果，今年如不遭遇意外灾害，完成了增产计划，绝大多数社员的收入要增加，有些劳力强土地少的社员甚至可比入社前增加收入一两倍。通过试算，使每个社员了解全社能增产多少、自己能分多少、为什么能多分，对提高社员认识和劳动积极性有很大作用。有的社员说：“过去光晓得合作社能增产，究竟能增产多少不摸底；又怀疑社里能增产，不一定自己能多分，这一算心里就亮堂了。”纷纷表示要加劲生产。一些过去不多出来的人也出来干活了。
    但是，由于各户原来生产水平不一、劳力、技术相差悬殊，和一些其它原因（如一些原为小商贩、手工业者或有其它收入的社员，干部因工作误工多挣分少等）约有百分之五至二十不等的社员户收入可能要比入社前减少。根据四川省简阳县解放社试算，完成增产计划后，一百一十七户中仍有十七户要减少收入。这十七户情况是：原来产量高的四户，土地多劳力少和缺少劳力的七户，有其他特种收入的六户（果农一户、菜农五户）。四川隆昌县新生、曙光二社共九十户，试算结果有十八户即百分之二十的户可能减少收入。计劳力弱技术差的八户，土地好产量高、人口多劳力少的六户，干部和烈军属四户。往年这些户多是稍请点零工或以牛工换人工，或全家动员、亲友邻居帮忙，或将土地出租自己干点其它活路、再加上经营点副业，收入仍不少；入社后虽然解决了他们缺乏劳力，或缺耕畜农具，或缺乏肥料，或生产技术不好等困难，但因为合作社是实行以劳为主的分配原则，相对地减少了土地的收益，他们的收入就减少了。
    经过试算，预计可能较往年减少收入百分之五或百分之十以下的户，只要今后在劳力调配上适当注意，使他们有机会多得些工分，就可大体解决。收入减少较多的，单从劳力调配上照顾还不够。因为他们情绪不安，有的看秋收，有的打算退社，有的依赖政府救济，有些干部或积极分子有话不好说，受到家庭责备。他们的不稳情绪影响着其他的社员和社外群众。因此，分配试算不是单纯的算账，而是一项细致的思想教育工作和组织工作。很多社一方面通过大多数户增加收入的可能性，使社员认识农业生产合作社的优越性，提高社员把社办好的信心。另一方面把可能减少收入户减少收入的原因分析给社员听。特别是着重说明：许多困难户入社后在合作社集体力量的帮助下，已减少了过去的许多困难（如请不到工、租不到耕牛以致要多付工资，或不得不延误季节而减产等），现在生活、生产都日渐稳定；而随着农业生产合作社的发展，集体力量的日益强大，这种困难就会越来越少，就会逐步和大家共同富裕起来。使他们看到社会主义的前途，积极热情地拥护农业生产合作社。在进行这些教育同时，还积极采取必要措施，使预计增加收入户确能增加收入，使可能减少收入的社员也能增加收入。
    各社解决这个问题的办法，首先是抓紧增产关键，采用新技术，预防或战胜可能发生的自然灾害，保证完成和超额完成社的增产计划。据解放社推算，如能超额完成增产计划，就有一半预计减少收入的户可变为增加收入。遂宁县五星社，利用一些不用的田坎地角，扩大耕地面积二十一亩，所产的粮食足够十五个人一年食用，全社收入增加了。社员收入也就有了保证。
    其次是发展社的集体副业和社员的家庭副业，并帮助社员解决从事副业生产的一些困难。如解放社有二十多户社员想喂猪，但缺乏饲料和本钱，社里就向人民银行贷款买了六十多只猪和羊，分配给他们饲养，又将全社所有能作饲料的豌豆叶、葫豆叶、菜根菜叶、红苕藤、玉米叶等分配给需要饲料的社员，换取猪肥，既增加了社里的肥料来源，又增加了社员收入。
    第三、在组织生产中，通过合理组织使用劳动力，有意识地组织可能减少收入户的劳力从事农、副业生产，尽可能使他们有多得工分的机会。但在照顾这些户时应很好地进行计划工作和教育工作，从有利于生产出发，防止为照顾而照顾的偏向，如分配给一些不能胜任的工作反而会影响生产和团结
  （如有的社员不会喂牛，为了照顾他分配去喂牛，结果把牛喂坏了等现象）。同时要注意教育全体社员，说明照顾他们对巩固合作社、达到共同富裕目的的重大意义，克服某些社员的嫉妒和平均主义思想。
    第四、对一些因特殊情况减少收入的，则采取不同办法处理，如解放社对菜农果农采取“包工包产、超产分红”的办法，使这些户收入不减少。对社干部误工太多的，主要是从改进领导作风和工作方法着手，减少一些不必要的会议，使他们有时间参加生产。对某些手工业者，在不影响社里生产的原则下允许出外作点工以增加收入。隆昌新生等二个社十八户可能减产的，用合理调配劳力解决了六户，另外编夏布的三户，饲养耕牛的三户，替社里养猪、羊、鹅的六户。经过这样一些措施，减少收入的户大体都可能增加收入，或是不减少收入了。有些户虽然收入减少了，但支出也同样减少了，如往年请工要付工资、饭费等，现在就不需要付了。各社对这些户也分别说明了情况，安定了情绪。
    试算以后，思想教育工作和组织工作做得好的社，都提高了社干部和社员办好社的信心，加强了社内中农和贫农的团结，进一步巩固了农业生产合作社。
