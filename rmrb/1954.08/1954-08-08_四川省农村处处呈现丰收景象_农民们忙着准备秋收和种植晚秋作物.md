(Dispatch from Chengdu, this paper, 7th) The rural areas of Sichuan in August are presenting scenes of bumper harvests everywhere. Fifty million mu of rice, soon to turn yellow and ripen, droop with heavy ears of grain; three million eight hundred thousand mu of cotton are covered with abundant buds; and forty million mu of well-growing corn, sorghum, and sweet potatoes sway in the fields. Farmers are joyfully welcoming the harvest. The province's more than 7,600 agricultural production cooperatives and 990,000 mutual aid teams have played a significant role in promoting agricultural production increases. Under their leadership, more than 100,000 small-scale water conservancy projects have been newly built and repaired throughout the province. At the same time, cultivation methods have been generally improved, fertilizer use has increased, appropriate close planting has been implemented, and timely weeding and pest control have been carried out. As a result, crops have thicker stalks, fuller grains, less lodging, and higher yields. According to typical surveys of key villages in twelve counties, including Luxian, Bishan, Jianyang, Wenjiang, and Tongjiang, the province's grain output will increase by 6%. The more than 20,000 mu of early rice already harvested in southern and eastern Sichuan has increased by an average of about 10% compared to last year. In the hilly areas of 49 agricultural production cooperatives in the Suining Special District, this year, due to a series of technical reforms that have improved labor efficiency, it is estimated that rice production will increase by 250,000 jin, cotton by 165,000 jin, and sweet potatoes by 2,350,000 jin. The Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in the plain area of Guanghan County expects to harvest 377,000 jin of grain from its 470 mu of rice, an increase of 17%. Peach Blossom Village in Shimen Township in the Fuling mountainous area harvested 38,000 jin of grain last year and is expected to reach 41,200 jin this year. To ensure the completion and overfulfillment of production increase tasks, various localities are actively preparing for the autumn harvest. The Suining Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China plans to promote 15,000 improved threshing machines to reduce scattering and increase the harvest yield. The Wanxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China plans to utilize the gap between the autumn harvest and autumn planting to plant an additional 700,000 mu of short-term crops such as ratooning rice, late rice, and potatoes.

    四川省农村处处呈现丰收景象
    农民们忙着准备秋收和种植晚秋作物
    【本报成都七日电】八月的四川乡村，处处呈现着丰收的景象。快黄熟了的五千万亩水稻，沉甸甸的谷穗低垂着头；三千八百万亩棉花，结满了累累的蓓蕾；生长良好的四千万亩玉米、高粱、红苕，在山野上迎风摆动。农民正欣喜的迎接着丰收。全省七千六百多个农业生产合作社和九十九万个互助组，对促进农业增产起了重大作用。在他们带动下，全省新修整修了十多万处小型水利，同时普遍改进了耕作方法，增多了肥料，适当实行了密植，加以及时薅秧锄草，防治病虫，因此，作物秆子粗，颗粒饱，倒伏少，产量高。根据泸县、璧山、简阳、温江、通江等十二县基点村典型调查，全省粮食将增产百分之六。川南、川东已经收割的两万多亩早稻，平均比去年增产百分之十左右。遂宁专区四十九个农业生产合作社的丘陵地，今年由于进行了一系列的技术改革，发挥了劳动效率，预计将增产稻谷二十五万斤，棉花十六万五千斤，红苕二百三十五万斤。平原广汉县光明农业生产合作社四百七十亩水稻，预计收谷三十七万七千斤，增产百分之十七。涪陵山区石门乡桃花村去年收谷三万八千斤，今年可达四万一千二百斤。为保证完成和超额完成增产任务，各地积极准备秋收。中共遂宁地委计划推广改良打谷机一万五千部，以减少抛撒，提高收获量；中共万县地委计划利用秋收后到秋种前的空隙时间，增种七十万亩再生稻、晚稻、马铃薯等短期作物。
