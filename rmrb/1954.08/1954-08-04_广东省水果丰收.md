Guangdong Province's Fruit Harvest

Summer is the season of abundant fruit production in southern China. Guangdong's famous lychees, papayas, pineapples, bananas, and watermelons are now on the market in large quantities. State-owned commercial organizations and cooperatives in Guangzhou are purchasing these fruits from various production areas at reasonable prices, transporting them to all parts of the country to meet people's needs. A portion is also being shipped to the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries.

Guangdong's fruit production has seen significant development in the three years since liberation, thanks to the ever-improving living standards of the people and the strong support of the People's Government. Large areas of wasteland and mountainous land have been converted into orchards, and the varieties and cultivation methods of fruit trees have been improved, resulting in a year-on-year increase in production. This year, Guangdong has again achieved a bumper fruit harvest. The output of pineapples alone is estimated to be double that of last year. (Attached Images)

    广东省水果丰收
    夏天，是我国南方水果盛产的季节。广东著名的荔枝、木瓜、菠萝、香蕉和西瓜等果品现已大量上市。广州市国营商业机构和合作社正以合理价格向各产区进行收购，运销全国各地，供应人民需要。一部分并运销苏联和各人民民主国家。
    广东的水果生产，由于解放后人民生活的日益提高和人民政府的大力扶助，三年来已有了很大的发展：大批荒地和山地已辟为果园，改良了果树的品种和栽培法，使生产量逐年增加。今年广东的水果又获得了丰收，光是菠萝的产量，估计可比去年增产一倍。（附图片）
