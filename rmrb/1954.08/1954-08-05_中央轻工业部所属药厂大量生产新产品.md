Pharmaceutical Factories under the Central Ministry of Light Industry Mass-Produce New Products

The pharmaceutical factories under the Central Ministry of Light Industry have trial-produced many new products, and some have already been mass-produced.

The state-owned Shanghai Precision Medical Equipment Factory and Shenyang Medical Equipment Factory trial-produced shortwave electrotherapy devices this year. The Shanghai factory alone produced 380 units in the first half of the year. This device is used to treat rheumatism and arthritis, and the effect is very good.

Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory has trial-produced "Phenacetin" this year. This is an antipyretic and analgesic with a similar effect to aspirin. Compound aspirin is made from it, aspirin, and caffeine. It mainly treats colds, fever, and pain, and has a wide range of uses. The plan is to produce five tons this year.

Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory has also trial-produced "Aminothiourea," a drug that mainly treats leprosy. According to clinical trials for leprosy in Qingdao, after four months of treatment, the plaque-like lesions of patients have shrunk, some have completely disappeared, and finger flexion and extension have gradually become more flexible. At the same time, the drug has significant effects on the treatment of fresh infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis, laryngeal tuberculosis, bronchial lymph node tuberculosis, intestinal tuberculosis, and tuberculous pleurisy. It also has a certain effect on chronic tuberculous toxemia and renal tuberculosis. The plan is to produce more than 1,100 kilograms this year. (Wang Baolin)

    中央轻工业部所属药厂大量生产新产品
    中央轻工业部所属药厂试制了很多新产品，有些已大量生产。
    国营上海精密医疗器械厂与沈阳医疗器械厂今年试制的短波电疗器，仅上海一个厂上半年就已生产了三百八十台。这种器械供作治疗风湿症、关节炎用，效果很好。
    山东新华制药厂今年试制了“非那西丁”，这是一种与阿司匹灵有类似作用的解热散，复方阿司匹灵，即由它和阿司匹灵、咖啡因配制而成。主治伤风感冒、解热止痛，用途很大。今年内计划生产五吨。
    山东新华药厂又试制成了“氨硫脲”，该药主治麻疯病。据在青岛市进行麻疯临床试验，患者经治疗四个月后，斑状损害缩小，有的完全消失，手指屈伸逐渐灵活。同时，该药对治疗新鲜的浸润性肺结核、喉头结核、枝气管淋巴结核、肠结核、结核性胸膜炎等均有显著效果。对慢性结核性中毒、肾结核等亦有一定效果。今年内计划生产一千一百多公斤。  （王保林）
