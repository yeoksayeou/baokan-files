Unified Teaching Plans for Various Specialties in National Higher Industrial Schools Basically Revised and Completed

The unified teaching plans for various specialties in national higher industrial schools have been basically revised and completed. The unified teaching plans for 108 engineering specialties, which have been centrally reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, have been distributed to various higher engineering colleges. The teaching plans for a few other specialties will also be reviewed and issued successively. From the new academic year of 1954, all colleges will organize teaching work according to the unified teaching plans.

Organizing teaching according to the teaching plans is one of the important steps for universities and colleges to ensure the quality of personnel training for construction. With unified teaching plans for various specialties, higher engineering colleges will have a unified basis for teaching. The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government entrusted the relevant higher industrial schools to revise more than 100 unified teaching plans for various specialties. It convened special meetings and, under the guidance of Soviet experts, conducted centralized reviews by categories such as general machinery, power machinery, electrical power, telecommunications, civil engineering, water conservancy, mining, metallurgy, geology, petroleum, chemical industry, and textile industry. Through this review, the training objectives of various specialties were further clarified, and detailed research and correction were made on various aspects such as the number of class hours, the connection between various courses, the coordination of theoretical teaching and experiments, and the translation of professional terms. There are unified regulations on the proportion of academic qualifications, basic courses, and basic technical course hours in various types of majors, as well as the distribution and arrangement of class hours in each semester.

    全国高等工业学校
    各种专业统一教学计划基本修订完成
    全国高等工业学校各种专业的统一教学计划已基本修订完成，中央人民政府高等教育部集中审查批准的工科一百零八种专业统一教学计划已经发到各高等工科院校，还有少数专业的教学计划也将陆续审订发出，各院校从一九五四年度新学年开始，将根据统一教学计划组织教学工作。
    根据教学计划组织教学，是高等学校保证培养建设人材的质量的重要步骤之一。高等工科院校有了各种专业统一的教学计划，在教学上就有了统一的依据。中央人民政府高等教育部委托各有关高等工业学校修订的一百多种专业统一教学计划，曾召集专门会议，在苏联专家指导下分普通机械、动力机械、电力、电讯、土木建筑、水利、采矿、冶金、地质、石油、化工、纺织等类进行集中审查，经过这次审查，更加明确了各种专业的培养目标，对课程的时数、各种课程的互相衔接、理论教学和实验的配合以及专业译名等各方面，都作了细致的研究和订正。各类专业的学历、基础课和基础技术课学时的比重、学时在各学期的分配与安排，都有统一的规定。　（新华社）
