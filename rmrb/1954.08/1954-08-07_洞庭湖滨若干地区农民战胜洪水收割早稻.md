    Farmers in Several Areas Around Dongting Lake Overcome Floods to Harvest Early Rice
    (Xinhua News Agency)
    Since the beginning of summer, although the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province has suffered from prolonged flooding, early rice has still been harvested in some areas thanks to the tireless flood prevention and rescue efforts of the vast number of cadres and farmers. In the Datong Lake area, after an intense battle to "seize grain from the flood," approximately 100,000 mu of early rice had already been harvested by late July. Since the beginning of July, the water level in the outer lake in this area has generally exceeded the highest historical flood level by 1 to 4 centimeters, and most of the top of the dikes are almost level with the flood level of the outer lake. Local Party and government cadres led more than 8,000 farmers in arduous labor for 20 days and nights, generally raising the 200-plus li-long dikes by 6 centimeters, protecting the harvest of 100,000 mu of early rice within the dikes. In Yiyang County, the Renmin Da Yuan (People's Great Embankment) has more than 75,000 mu of rice paddies, close to the Zi River and Phoenix Lake. This area has been engaged in flood prevention and waterlogging drainage since late June. When the river and lake floods rose successively in early July, the lake embankment in the southeast of the Da Yuan was only 3 to 4 centimeters away from the flood level. On the 6th, it was hit by a storm, and the waves battered the embankment, making the situation very critical. At that time, Zhang Yilin, Secretary of the Yiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, led more than 6,000 farmers to reinforce the lake embankment. After six days and six nights of hard work, the 60-plus li-long lake embankment was generally raised by 1 to 2 meters, and the outer slope of the embankment was generally woven with wooden stakes and reeds, finally blocking the waves. Now nearly 30,000 mu of early rice with harvest in the whole Yuan has been harvested. Farmers in the Lingbei and Shatian Yuans in Xiangyin County have also successively overcome six flood attacks and four waterlogging disasters, so that more than 20,000 mu of early rice can still yield 300 to 400 jin per mu. The farmers are very grateful to the Communist Party and the People's Government for the harvest of early rice. The Renshun Yuan in Xiangyin County has more than 80,000 mu of rice paddies, which has experienced many flood tests. In one flood attack at the end of June alone, more than 100 meters of the Huanghuagang embankment in this Yuan collapsed. Local cadres and farmers rescued it together for seven days and seven nights, driving in more than 4,000 piles and throwing 8,000 sacks, and repairing a new 96-meter-long dike, turning the embankment from danger to safety. The farmers said that without the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Yuan would have collapsed long ago, and there would be no early rice harvest.

    洞庭湖滨若干地区农民战胜洪水收割早稻
    湖南省洞庭湖滨地区入夏以来虽然遭受长时期的洪水侵袭，但经过广大干部和农民夜以继日地防汛抢险，若干地区的早稻仍有收成。大通湖地区经过“与洪水争粮”的紧张战斗，约有十万多亩早稻已在七月下旬收割。这个地区自七月上旬以来，外湖的水位一般超过历年最高洪水位一公寸到四公寸，大部分堤顶都几乎和外湖洪水位相平。当地党、政机关干部带领着八千多农民，艰辛劳动达二十昼夜，使两百多里长的堤防普遍加高六公寸，保卫了大堤内十万多亩早稻的收获。益阳县人民大垸内有七万五千多亩稻田，紧靠资水和凤凰湖之间。这个地区自六月下旬起展开防汛、排渍斗争，到七月初江、湖洪水相继上涨时，大垸东南部的湖堤距洪水位只有三、四公寸，六日又遇风暴，风浪冲击堤岸，情势十分危急。那时中共益阳县委员会书记张宜林带领着六千多农民抢修湖堤，经过六天六夜的努力，六十多里长的湖堤普遍加高一、两公尺，堤防外坡又普遍用木桩和芦苇编织起来，终于挡住了风浪。现在全垸近三万亩有收成的早稻已经收割。湘阴县岭北、沙田两垸农民也连续战胜六次洪水袭击和四次积水灾害，使两万多亩早稻每亩仍能收获三、四百斤。农民们在收割早稻中都很感激共产党和人民政府。湘阴县仁顺垸有八万多亩稻田，已经历多次洪水考验。单是六月底一次洪水袭击，这个垸子的黄花港堤身就坐崩一百多公尺；当地干部和农民一道抢救七天七夜，打桩四千多个，丢麻袋八千个，抢修好一道九十六公尺长的新堤，使堤身转危为安。农民说，如果没有共产党和人民政府的领导，早就溃了垸，还有什么早稻收割。
