    The Masters' Review and Decision
    ——A Record of Attending Jinan People's Congress Representatives' Discussions on Government Work
    Tang Zhengzhong
    On the afternoon of July 11th, three hundred and seven representatives of the first Jinan Municipal People's Congress, in accordance with the draft constitution's provision that "the organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels," divided into eight delegations and fifteen groups to hold meetings, discuss, and review the Jinan Municipal People's Government's basic summary of the past five years' work and its current main tasks.

    A sense of honor for being responsible to the people of the entire city inspired the representatives, and they spoke enthusiastically and widely. The representatives expressed their opinions on every task. The first group of the fifth delegation, comprising twenty-three representatives—including Mayor Chen Meichuan and Deputy Mayor Zhang Dongmu—saw twenty-two representatives speak within just three and a half hours on the afternoon of the 11th, with some speaking as many as four times.

    In their speeches, many representatives first affirmed the achievements of the Jinan Municipal People's Government over the past five years, and supplemented this with specific facts. At the same time, they offered serious criticism of the shortcomings and errors existing in the government's work. The scope of criticism included safe production, waterwheel supply, strengthening leadership over handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce, sanitation campaigns, labor employment, and even municipal construction, housing repairs, and the implementation of the Marriage Law.

    The representatives also seriously criticized the Jinan Municipal Health Bureau for not being vigorous enough in implementing the policy of "prevention first." Representative Zhao Jiguang said, "Last year, Jinan carried out some emergency prevention and treatment work for the epidemic diseases that occurred, but the Municipal Health Bureau did not seem to have learned the necessary lessons and did not take the necessary measures earlier this year." Representative Wang Yuanxin criticized the Jinan Municipal Health Bureau's sanitation work as being a "gust of wind"—when a sanitation campaign comes, it requires the masses to sweep the yards and wipe the windows, only looking for surface cleanliness and seeking fanfare, but without properly checking how well the masses usually pay attention to hygiene in terms of diet, housing, and rest, and how well they understand hygiene. He believed: "Sanitation work is worse this year than last year, and worse in government organs than in the streets. The Municipal People's Government should pay immediate attention to this." Representative Hong Zhanwu, the head of the secretarial section of Renfeng Textile Mill, reminded the Health Bureau to pay attention to the "two major enemies" of the people in the North City District—mosquitoes and flies—which were harming the health of workers and affecting production, and should be resolved as soon as possible. He said: "There are more flies again this year, mainly because there is not enough education for the masses. Last year, many people were seen hitting flies with fly swatters on the streets, but this year there are very few. Last year there were many trash cans, but most of them are now broken. Attention should be paid now that watermelon peels are coming!" Representatives Liu Qingxiang and Dong Lingying criticized the Municipal Health Bureau for not promptly studying and preventing occupational diseases in factories. They believed that this was related to the implementation of the policy of sanitation work oriented towards production and must be given high priority. Representative Liu Qingxiang also used specific examples to expose the error of the Municipal Health Bureau's subordinate institutions emphasizing work systems and being unwilling to examine workers' bodies according to the work schedule of the Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory. To understand the overall sanitation work situation in Jinan this year, the second group of the sixth delegation also asked Shi Jixian, Deputy Director of the Jinan Municipal Health Bureau, to report on his work to the group and answer relevant questions through the Congress Secretariat.

    To make the discussion more in-depth, based on the comprehensive discussion, the Congress conducted group discussions on the afternoon of the 12th, and the representatives were divided into eight professional groups (the military representatives formed another group), such as industry, commercial market, handicrafts, municipal construction, political and legal affairs, culture and education, health, and agriculture, to further discuss and review the work summary and current main tasks. Each professional group was chosen by the representatives themselves to participate in, but it was not restricted, and if they had opinions on other work, the representatives could also express their opinions in writing or in person to the relevant group. The Presidium of the Congress also determined that all work departments of the Municipal People's Government should fully prepare materials to provide to the representatives as reference when discussing issues, and if necessary, the responsible comrades of the relevant departments of the Municipal People's Government should personally come to explain.

    In the discussion of future work tasks, the representatives further carried out criticism and self-criticism, and, proceeding from reality, specifically determined the future tasks.

    In a city like Jinan, commercial market issues are obviously very important. In this professional group, thirty-six representatives had a lively discussion. The issue started with the out-of-stock and stockpiling of goods in the market. Representative Li Zongdai first criticized the state-owned commerce for poor planning and lack of investigation and research into social needs, resulting in the phenomenon that some commodities were out of stock and some commodities were stockpiled. Representatives Ding Kaimin, Han Yunyou, Wang Yuting, and others put forward different opinions. They believed that poor planning and insufficient investigation and research by state-owned commerce were only one of the reasons for the imbalance in market supply; on the other hand, the speculation and hoarding by some private businesses, disregarding state plans, was an important reason. Representative Han Yunyou said: "Taking the tea industry as an example. Last year, tea was once out of stock, and some private tea shops disregarded the interests of the state, hoarding it and not selling it, and at the same time, they purchased large quantities from other places; in this way, when the state-owned company arrived with the goods, there was naturally a phenomenon of stockpiling in the market." In his speech, Representative Ding Kaimin exposed the fact that the private Zhongdong Alkali Factory did not abide by the contract and privately sold the caustic soda it was processing for the state for profit, which affected the state's supply plan. In addition, he also exposed the ugly facts of the private Yuchanghao raising prices and the private Datong Dye Factory cutting corners in the processing of cooked blue for the state, and criticized the Municipal People's Government for not being strong enough in punishing illegal capitalists for repeating the "five poisons." He believed that the state-owned economy should further strengthen its leadership over private commerce, and the government's industrial and commercial departments should also strengthen administrative management of the market. Representative Zhang Bingshu, the director of the Joint Committee of the National Pharmaceutical Agency Industry, used the example of the national pharmaceutical industry reporting the quantity of Coptis chinensis casually, but at the same time secretly purchasing it from other places, resulting in stockpiling, to illustrate the harm of the blindness of private commercial operations. Therefore, he believed that it was very necessary to strengthen the leadership of state-owned commerce over private commerce, gradually incorporate private commerce into the state plan, and carry out socialist transformation.

    Municipal construction is a major event related to the vital interests of the people of the city. As of July 12th, only the proposals and opinions on municipal construction that had been compiled by the Congress numbered one hundred and three. All the proposals and opinions represented the opinions and wishes of the masses, but in today's focus on national construction, it is necessary to consider their priorities. The municipal construction professional group, based on the budget and appropriation of various municipal construction undertakings in Jinan issued by the Congress Presidium, checked the relevant proposals and opinions on municipal construction item by item on July 12th, and decided to use the limited money in the most needed places according to the priorities. For example, in the opinions, someone suggested that "a hydroelectric power station should be built on the Yellow River." The representatives believed that it was necessary to build a hydroelectric power station on the Yellow River, but it was not possible according to the city's current financial situation, so it was decided not to consider it for the time being. When discussing where municipal construction should be carried out at present, the representatives believed that it was necessary to first carry out overall urban planning and determine the city's development scale. The representatives used many examples to show that the lack of overall planning for municipal construction not only caused serious waste, but also failed to carry out construction well. The representatives unanimously believed that an organization should be established to lead the overall urban planning and immediately carry out the work. However, before there is an overall plan, municipal construction work should continue to be carried out with emphasis. Therefore, the representatives decided that the responsible persons of the Jinan Water Company, the Jinan Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau, and other relevant departments should report on this year's municipal construction plan to the municipal construction group on the morning of the next day, and draw up relevant plan charts for review.

    In order to let all the representatives know the situation of the discussions in each professional group and put forward their own opinions, the Congress held a plenary meeting again on the morning of the 14th, and each professional group gave a specific report on the discussion and review, so that a final resolution could be made after discussion by all the representatives.

    主人翁的审查和决定
    ——济南市人民代表大会代表讨论政府工作旁听记
    汤正忠
    七月十一日的下午，济南市第一届人民代表大会的三百零七位代表，按照宪法草案关于“人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会”的规定，分成八个代表团十五个小组举行会议，讨论和审查济南市人民政府五年来的工作基本总结和当前主要任务。
    对全市人民负责的荣誉感鼓舞了代表们，他们发言十分热烈、普遍。代表们对每一项工作都发表了自己的意见。第五代表团第一小组共有二十三位代表——其中包括市长陈梅川和副市长张东木，在十一日下午短短的三个半钟头内，就有二十二位代表发言，有的人还一连发言四次。
    在发言中，许多代表都首先肯定了济南市人民政府五年来的工作成绩，并以具体事实加以说明和补充。同时，他们对政府工作中存在着的缺点和错误进行了严肃的批评。批评的范围包括安全生产、水车供应、加强对手工业和资本主义工商业的领导、卫生运动、劳动就业，一直到市政建设、房屋修缮和贯彻婚姻法。
    代表们对于济南市人民政府卫生局在贯彻预防为主的方针方面不够有力，也进行了严肃的批评。赵继光代表说：“去年，济南市对发生的流行性病症曾突击进行过一些预防和治疗工作，但是市卫生局似乎并没有接受应有的经验教训，在今年还不早作应有的措施。”代表王元信批评济南市卫生局的卫生工作是一阵风，来了卫生运动，就要群众扫院子，抹窗子，光看表面干净，只求轰轰烈烈，但没有很好地检查人民群众平时究竟在饮食方面、居住方面、作息方面注意卫生和对卫生认识的程度如何。他认为：“卫生工作是今年比去年差，机关比街道差，市人民政府应该立即引起注意。”代表洪占五是仁丰纱厂的秘书科长，他提醒卫生局应该注意市北区人民的“两大敌人”——蚊子和苍蝇在损害着职工健康和影响着生产，应该及早解决。他说：“今年苍蝇又多了，主要是对群众教育不够。去年群众在街上拿苍蝇拍打苍蝇的很多，今年却很少看到。去年垃圾箱很多，现在多已坏了。应该注意现在又是西瓜皮到来的时候了！”代表刘庆祥、董灵英对市卫生局没有抓紧研究和防治工厂职业病提出了批评。他们认为：这是关系着贯彻卫生工作面向生产的方针问题，必须引起高度重视。刘庆祥代表并以具体事例揭发了市卫生局所属机构强调工作制度，不愿根据济南第二机床厂作息时间检查职工身体的错误。第六代表团第二小组为了了解济南市今年整个卫生工作情况，还通过大会秘书处叫济南市卫生局石继先副局长到小组汇报工作，回答有关问题。
    为了使讨论更加深入，在全面讨论的基础上，大会在十二日下午分组进行讨论，代表们划分为工业、商业市场、手工业、市政建设、政法、文化教育、卫生和农业等八个专业组（部队代表另成一组），进一步讨论和审查工作总结和当前主要任务。各个专业组都由代表们自己选择参加，但并不受限制，如果对其他工作有意见时，代表还可以用书面或亲自到有关组去发表意见。大会主席团并确定市人民政府所有工作部门要充分准备材料，供给代表们作讨论问题时的参考，有需要时，市人民政府有关部门负责同志还要亲自来作解释说明。
    在今后工作任务的讨论中，代表们更深入地展开了批评和自我批评，并从实际出发，具体确定了今后任务。
    在济南这样一个城市里，商业市场问题显然是一个很重要的问题。在这个专业组里，三十六位代表展开了热烈的讨论。问题是从市场上的商品脱销和积压开始的。代表李宗岱首先批评了国营商业计划不周，对社会需要缺乏调查研究，以致发生有些商品脱销、有些商品积压的现象。代表丁凯民、韩云佑、王雨亭等却提出了不同的意见。他们认为国营商业计划不周、调查研究不够，只是市场供应不平衡的原因之一；而另一方面，某些私营商业不顾国家计划，进行投机倒把囤积居奇则是一个重要的原因。代表韩云佑说：“以茶叶业为例。去年茶叶曾经一度脱销，某些私营茶庄即不顾国家利益，囤积不卖，同时还到外地大量采购；这样，当国营公司到货后，市场上就又自然形成了积压现象。”代表丁凯民在发言中揭发了私营中东碱厂不遵守合同，私自将替国家加工的烧碱出售牟利，以致影响国家的供应计划的事实。另外，他还揭发了私营玉昌号抬高物价、私营大同染料厂替国家加工煮青偷工减料等丑恶事实，批评了市人民政府惩治不法资本家重施“五毒”方面还不够有力。他认为国营经济应该进一步加强对私营商业的领导，政府工商部门也应加强对市场的行政管理。代表张秉书是国药代理业联营社委员会主任，他以国药业随便上报黄连数量，但同时又到外地偷购，结果造成积压的事例，说明私营商业经营盲目性的危害，因此，他认为加强国营商业对私营商业的领导，逐步把私营商业纳入国家计划轨道，进行社会主义改造，是非常必要的。
    市政建设是关系着全市人民切身利益的大事，截至七月十二日，只是大会整理出来的有关市政建设的提案和意见，已有一百零三条。所有提案和意见都是代表着群众的意见和愿望的，但是在国家正在重点建设的今天，是需要考虑其轻重缓急的。市政建设专业组就根据大会主席团印发的济南市市政建设各项事业的预算和拨款情况，在七月十二日逐项核对了有关市政建设的提案和意见，根据轻重缓急决定把有数的钱用在最需要的地方去。譬如在意见中，有人提议“应在黄河修建水力发电站”。代表们认为在黄河修水力发电站是需要的，但根据目前本市财政情况还不可能做到，因此决定暂不考虑。代表们在讨论目前那些地方该进行市政建设时，认为必须首先进行城市总体规划，确定本市的发展规模。代表们用很多事例说明市政建设没有总体规划，不但造成严重浪费，而且不能很好进行建设。代表们一致认为：应该成立领导进行城市总体规划的机构，立即进行工作。但在没有总体规划以前，市政建设工作还应当有重点地继续进行。因此，代表们又确定第二天上午，由济南市自来水公司、济南市人民政府建设局等有关部门负责人，到市政建设小组汇报今年市政建设的计划，并绘出有关计划图表送交审查。
    为了使所有的代表都知道各专业组讨论的情况，并提出自己的意见，大会在十四日上午又举行了全体会议，由各专业组具体汇报了讨论审查的情况，以便经全体代表讨论最后做出决议。
