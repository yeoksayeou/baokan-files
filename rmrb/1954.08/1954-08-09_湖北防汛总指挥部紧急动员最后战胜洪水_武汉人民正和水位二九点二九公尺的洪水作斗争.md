Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 8th. The Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters issued an "Emergency Mobilization Order for Final Victory Over the Floods" on August 7th. The mobilization order first pointed out: Under the close care of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and with the strong support of the people of the whole country, millions of workers in the Jianghan lakeside area of Hubei Province and the troops participating in flood prevention and rescue have fought the floods for a long time. They have highly developed the spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, repeatedly overcoming the threats of the highest flood peaks in the Yangtze River and Han River in nearly a century, defending the Jingjiang Dam, the Huangshi City Dam, the Papu Dam, and the main dikes on the north and south banks of the Han River, and have strongly supported and cooperated with the struggle to protect Wuhan. It has made great contributions and achieved remarkable results in protecting national economic construction, protecting important cities along the river (especially Wuhan, which has significant strategic significance in both political and economic terms), and protecting the lives and property of millions of people in the Jianghan Plain.

The mobilization order then pointed out: At present, the water situation in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River is still very tense. Due to the large volume of water and the difficulty of discharge downstream, the fourth flood peak of the Yangtze River is about to arrive, and the third flood peak of the Han River and the fifth flood peak of the Yangtze River will follow closely. The water level in the Wuhan area is bound to continue to rise. Various dike sections that have been soaked at high water levels and impacted by strong winds and waves for a long time have been damaged to varying degrees. The flood control struggle has entered an extremely serious final decisive stage, which is also approaching the final victory stage. To this end, the mobilization order requires all localities to make persistent efforts, remain calm and brave, go all out, and never fall short. We must neither panic because of the above-mentioned serious situation, nor be negligent or careless in the slightest. The mobilization order called on flood control headquarters at all levels and all Communist Party members, Youth League members, all cadres, all workers, and troops participating in flood control to mobilize urgently again, organize all forces, think of all methods, not fear hardship, not be afraid of fatigue, be responsible to the Party, the country, and the people, and spare no cost to carry out heroic and tenacious struggles for the final victory over the floods and the safety of the Jingjiang Dam, Wuhan, Huangshi, and all dike sections.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 8th. Recently, it has been raining in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Three Gorges area, and the middle and upper reaches of the Han River. The water levels of the Yangtze River and the Han River in the middle reaches have continued to rise in the past two days. At 12:00 noon on the 7th, the Yangtze River water level at Wuhan Customs rose to 29.28 meters, and at 6:00 p.m. on the 7th, it reached 29.29 meters, 1.01 meters higher than the highest water level in previous years. Under such an unusually high water level, Wuhan is mobilizing various means of transportation, day and night, to transport large quantities of soil, stone, and various flood control materials from all over to continue to raise and thicken the Zhanggong Dike and the dikes along the Yangtze River and the Han River. Under the high water level of over 28 meters, the 100,000-strong flood control team in Wuhan, which has been fighting continuously for nearly a month, is bravely and intelligently guarding the dikes in various sections. Many youth commando teams from government agencies and schools are participating in the fourth phase of dike reinforcement and heightening work in large numbers. Many women and children in various streets of the city have also been collecting scattered stones and bricks for days, transporting them to the front line of the dikes.

    湖北防汛总指挥部紧急动员最后战胜洪水
    武汉人民正和水位二九点二九公尺的洪水作斗争
   【新华社武汉八日电】湖北省防汛总指挥部八月七日发出“为最后战胜洪水的紧急动员令”。动员令首先指出：在中国共产党、中央人民政府、毛主席的亲切关怀和全国人民的大力支持下，湖北省江汉滨湖地区百万民工和参加防汛抢险的部队，和洪水进行了长期持续的斗争，高度发扬了爱国主义和革命英雄主义的精神，多次战胜了长江、汉水近百年来未有的最高洪峰的威胁，守住了荆江大堤、黄石市堤、粑铺大堤、汉水南北岸各主要堤防，并有力地支援和配合了保卫武汉市的斗争。对于保卫国家经济建设、保卫沿江重要城市、（特别是在政治上、经济上均具有重大战略意义的武汉市）保卫江汉平原数百万人民生命财产的安全，已经作出了巨大的贡献，取得了显著的成绩。
    动员令接着指出：目前长江中游水情仍然非常紧张，由于水势太大，而且下游顶托，宣泄不易，而长江第四次洪峰即将到来，汉水第三次洪峰和长江第五次洪峰又要接踵而下。武汉一带水位势必继续上涨。长期在高水位浸泡和狂风巨浪冲击下的各堤段均受到不同程度的损害，防汛斗争已进入极端严重的最后决战阶段，也是接近最后胜利的阶段。为此，动员令要求各地必需再接再厉，沉着勇敢，全力以赴，切勿功亏一篑。我们既不能因上述严重情况而惊慌失措；也不能丝毫麻痹松懈，疏忽大意。动员令号召各级防汛指挥部和所有参加防汛的共产党员、青年团员、全体干部、全体民工和参加防汛的部队，再次紧急动员起来，组织一切力量，想尽一切办法，不怕艰险，不辞劳苦，为党、为国家、为人民负责到底，不惜任何代价，为最后战胜洪水，保卫荆江大堤、武汉市、黄石市和各堤段的安全而进行英勇顽强的斗争。
   【新华社武汉八日电】最近长江上游、三峡一带、汉水中、上游各地还在下雨，长江中游和汉水水位近两天来又继续上涨。七日中午十二时，武汉关长江水位涨到二九点二八公尺，七日下午六时，已达二九点二九公尺，高出历年最高水位一点零一公尺。武汉市在这样异常高的水位下，正动员各种交通工具，日夜紧张地从各地运来大批土、石和各种防汛器材，继续对张公堤和沿江、沿河堤防加高加厚。在二八公尺以上的高水位下，持续斗争近一个月的武汉市十万防汛队伍，正在各个堤段勇敢机智地守卫着堤防。许多机关、学校的青年突击队正大批地参加第四期堤防加固加高的工作。全市各街道的许多妇女、儿童也连日收集零碎的石块砖头，输送到堤防前线。
