Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, August 19th: The Vietnamese People's Army and the French Union Forces transferred prisoners of war and detained civilians in Viet Tri and岑山 (Cen Shan) on August 18th.

　　The Vietnamese side handed over to the French side 350 European and African prisoners of war, all in good health, including three lieutenants in越池 (Viet Tri). The French side handed over to the Vietnamese side one thousand soldiers and detained civilians, including 252 soldiers. Among the released Vietnamese civilians were ten sick people, fourteen children and seven elderly people.

　　The prisoner of war transfer work carried out in Haicun (海村) in Cen Shan (岑山), northern central Vietnam, lasted from 4 pm to 11 pm, because the list of prisoners of war originally given by the French side to the Vietnamese side did not match the prisoners of war actually transferred on the 18th. The Vietnamese side handed over 201 prisoners of war to the French side, of which 181 were European and African prisoners of war. The French side handed over 1,935 people, most of whom were civilians arrested by the French army in recent "sweeping" battles, including three children aged 12 to 15 and 28 sick and wounded. According to the list of prisoners of war originally given by the French side to the Vietnamese side, the French side should have handed over 165 personnel from the regular army and local forces of the Vietnamese People's Army, but after on-the-spot inspection, it was found that this number did not match the number of released prisoners of war. Many so-called soldiers were actually civilians.

　　Tens of thousands of Vietnamese people came to the prisoner of war exchange locations to welcome the people's fighters and compatriots back to the embrace of the motherland.

　　The prisoner exchange work in Cen Shan continued on the 19th.

    越法双方在越池等地交换战俘和被拘平民
    【新华社十九日讯】据越南通讯社北越十九日讯：越南人民军方面和法兰西联邦部队方面八月十八日在越池和岑山两地移交战俘和被拘平民。
    越方在越池移交给法方三百五十名全都健康的欧非籍战俘，其中包括三名尉官。法方向越方移交了士兵和被拘平民一千人，其中士兵二百五十二名。被释放的越南平民中包括十名病人，十四名小孩和七名老年人。
    在中越北部岑山的海村所进行的战俘移交工作，从下午四时一直延长到十一时，因为法方原先交给越方的战俘名单和十八日实际移交的战俘不符。越方移交给法方二百零一名战俘，其中有一百八十一名是欧非籍战俘。法方交出了一千九百三十五名，其中大部分是在不久以前的“扫荡”战中被法军逮捕的平民，包括十二岁到十五岁的儿童三名和病伤员二十八名。根据法方原先交给越方的战俘名单，法方应该交出越南人民军正规军和地方部队人员一百六十五名，但是就地检查以后，发现这个数目和被释放的战俘数目不符。有许多所谓的军人实际上是平民。
    成千上万的越南人民都到移交战俘的地点来欢迎人民战士和同胞回到祖国怀抱。
    岑山的交换战俘工作十九日在继续进行中。
