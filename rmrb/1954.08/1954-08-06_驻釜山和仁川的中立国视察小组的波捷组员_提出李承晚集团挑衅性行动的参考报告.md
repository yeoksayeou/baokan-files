(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th) The Military Armistice Commission received on August 3rd reference reports from the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Teams stationed in Busan and Incheon, South Korea, submitted by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. These two reference reports reported to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the provocative and terrorist actions organized and directed by the Syngman Rhee group against and threatening the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Teams, which have occurred in Busan and Incheon since July 31.

    The reference report from the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Team stationed in Busan stated: On the afternoon of July 31, "a bullet from a .45 caliber pistol was insidiously fired into the camp of the Eighth Neutral Nations Supervisory Team from about ten meters away, towards four Czechoslovak personnel who were then entering the dining room."

    The reference report from the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Team stationed in Incheon narrated the so-called "demonstration" marches organized and directed by the Syngman Rhee group's police and secret agents against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Team. It stated, "Due to this fact, the liaison officer advised the Swiss-Czechoslovak group (note: a subgroup of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Team stationed in Incheon) to cancel the inspection of the K-16 airfield; and said at the Neutral Nations Supervisory Team meeting on August 2 that the demonstrators would regard it (note: referring to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Team performing its legitimate routine inspection duties) as a provocation." This fact confirms that the reason the US side is instigating the Syngman Rhee group to carry out such provocative and violent actions that violate the armistice agreement and international norms is to obstruct and sabotage the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Teams from performing their legitimate duties, attempting to thereby undermine the clauses in the armistice agreement relating to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and create a tense situation.

    驻釜山和仁川的中立国视察小组的波捷组员
    提出李承晚集团挑衅性行动的参考报告
    【新华社开城四日电】军事停战委员会八月三日收到了中立国监察委员会送来的驻南朝鲜釜山和仁川两个中立国视察小组的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克组员的参考报告。这两份参考报告向中立国监察委员会报告了自七月三十一日以来在釜山和仁川发生的由李承晚集团组织和指挥的反对和威胁中立国监察委员会以及中立国视察小组的挑衅性恐怖行动。
    驻釜山中立国视察小组的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克组员的参考报告说：七月三十一日下午，“大约从十公尺以外有零点四五口径的手枪子弹阴险地射入了第八中立国视察小组营地，射向那时正走进餐室的四位捷克斯洛伐克人员。”
    驻仁川中立国视察小组的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克组员的参考报告叙述了由李承晚集团警察和特务组织和指挥的反对中立国监察委员会和中立国视察小组的所谓“示威”游行后说，“由于这个事实，联络官劝告瑞士—捷克斯洛伐克分组（按：驻仁川中立国视察小组的一个分组）把到K—十六机场进行的视察取消；并在八月二日的中立国视察小组会议上说，示威游行者会把它（按：指中立国视察小组执行其合法的例行的视察职司）看作是挑衅。”这一事实证实，美方所以指使李承晚集团进行这种违反停战协定和国际常规的挑衅性暴力行动，就是要阻挠和破坏中立国监察委员会和中立国视察小组执行它的合法的职司，企图借此破坏停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的条款和制造紧张局势。
