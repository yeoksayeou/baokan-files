    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 29th. Over 38 million mu of middle-season rice in Hunan Province is generally ripening and harvesting has begun. Judging from the progress of the harvest, the overall yield is good. Southern Hunan Province, where harvesting began earlier, has already reported news of a bumper harvest. For example, the Gantangwan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yizhang County has harvested 17 mu of middle-season rice, averaging 610 jin per mu, an increase of 14% compared to last year. The mutual aid team led by Chai Cailin, a provincial agricultural labor model in Ningyuan County, harvested over 1,000 jin per mu on a high-yield plot.

    In order to increase grain yield, farmers throughout Hunan Province are launching a campaign for careful harvesting and threshing to ensure every grain returns home. Thousands of mutual aid teams in Pingjiang, Changsha, and Ningxiang counties have developed detailed harvesting plans before the autumn harvest. Farmers generally believe that: "Fine rain forms rivers, and grains of rice fill baskets. Losing one less jin of grain is one more contribution to support the disaster areas and the country." Farmers in Changsha County are striving to harvest an additional five to seven jin per mu. In order to harvest an additional 20,000 jin of grain from over 2,000 mu of middle-season rice, farmers in Luqiao Township, Zixing County, have installed bamboo mats around their threshing drums to prevent scattering. Farmers in Wugang County were not accustomed to installing bamboo mats around their threshing drums in the past, but this year they have purchased over 7,000 bamboo mats from supply and marketing cooperatives. Xiangtan, Changde, Hengyang, and Chen County regions are organizing a large number of temporary mutual aid teams. The counties in Chen County region are also conducting temporary mutual assistance and exchange labor between regions, townships, and villages to ensure that "ripe fields are harvested one by one." Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places are rationally scheduling labor, and harvesting is progressing rapidly.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 29th. Many farmers in Hubei Province are paying attention to careful harvesting and threshing during the autumn harvest to ensure every grain returns home, in order to increase grain yield.

    In the past, farmers in Hubei Province experienced significant waste and loss during rice harvesting. According to surveys in Xishui, Wuchang, and other places, losses in the processes of cutting, bundling, carrying, threshing, milling, and shaking alone amounted to more than ten jin per mu, and in some cases more than thirty jin. This year, a widespread campaign for increasing production and practicing thrift has been launched. Before the harvest, many agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers held meetings to review and calculate the waste and loss phenomena in past harvests. This led to criticism and correction of the erroneous idea held by some farmers that "a little waste is inevitable," and further realization that plugging these loopholes would better support national construction and the people in disaster areas. Therefore, farmers in various places have found many tricks for careful harvesting and threshing, and have developed harvesting plans. Farmers in Xiaogan County plan to achieve "three lights" and "three cleans" during harvesting, namely light cutting, light bundling, light carrying, and clean threshing, clean collection, and clean sweeping. The Dengta and Xingxing agricultural production cooperatives in Xishui County proposed to achieve clean cutting, small bundles, small hugs, slow walking, more milling, clean shaking, and light rolling during harvesting, striving to harvest an additional 20 jin of grain per mu. Members of the Cai Yitian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gucheng County have also established a covenant for careful harvesting and threshing.

    Currently, farmers throughout Hubei Province are carefully cutting and threshing rice. In Luzuxi Township, Yidu County, the 172 mu of rice that has already been harvested yielded an additional 378 jin of grain simply by padding the threshing floor with reed mats. The Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jingmen County adopted the method of bundling grain with reed mats underneath, yielding an additional five to six sheng of grain per mu.

    湖南省三千多万亩中稻开始收割
    湖北省农民在秋收中注意细收细打争取颗粒还家
    【新华社长沙二十九日电】湖南省三千八百多万亩中稻普遍黄熟，开始收割。从已收割的情况看，一般收成良好。收割较早的湖南省南部，已传来丰收喜讯。如宜章县甘塘湾农业生产合作社已收割中稻十七亩，平均每亩六百一十斤，比去年增产百分之十四。宁远县省农业劳动模范柴彩林领导的互助组，有一丘丰产田平均每亩收到一千多斤。
    为了提高粮食收获量，湖南省各地农民都在展开细打细收颗粒回家的运动。平江、长沙、宁乡三县几千个互助组，秋收前都订出了细打细收的计划。农民们普遍认为：细雨落成河，粒米积成箩，少损失一斤谷，就多一分力量支援灾区、支援国家。长沙县农民正在争取每亩多收五斤到七斤。资兴县鹿硚乡农民为了要使二千多亩中稻多收二万斤谷，把打谷用的拌桶都装上了围簟，以避免抛撒。武冈县农民过去不习惯在拌桶上装围簟，今年已向供销合作社买到七千多张围簟。湘潭、常德、衡阳、郴县等专区都在组织大量临时互助组，郴县专区各县还在开展区和区、乡和乡、村和村之间的临时互助换工，以便作到“熟一丘，割一丘”。各地农业生产合作社和互助组都进行合理排工，收割很快。
    【新华社武汉二十九日电】湖北省很多农民在秋收中注意细收细割，争取颗粒回家，以提高粮食收获量。
    湖北省农民过去在收割稻谷中，浪费损失很大。据浠水、武昌等地调查：仅割、捆、挑、打、碾、抖几个工序中，每亩损失稻谷达十斤以上，多的达三十多斤。今年各地普遍开展了增产节约运动。收割前，很多农业生产合作社、互助组、单干农民纷纷开会，检查并计算往年收割中浪费损失的现象。这就使某些农民认为“浪费一点不可避免”的错误思想得到批判和纠正，进一步认识到要是把这些漏洞堵住了，就能更好地支援国家建设，支援灾区人民。因此，各地农民纷纷找出很多细收细打的窍门，并订出了收割计划。孝感县农民计划收割时做到“三轻”和“三净”，即轻割、轻捆、轻挑和打净、收净、扫净。浠水县灯塔、星星两个农业生产合作社提出要在收割时作到割净、抱少、捆小、走慢、多碾、抖净、卷轻等，争取每亩田多收二十斤谷。谷城县蔡以田农业生产合作社社员们还订立了细打细收的公约。
    现在，湖北省各地农民正在细心割打稻谷。宜都县绿足西乡已收割的一百七十二亩水稻，仅打谷时谷场上垫了芦席项，就多收了三百七十八斤谷。荆门县前进农业生产合作社采用垫着芦席捆谷的办法，每亩多收谷五升到六升。
