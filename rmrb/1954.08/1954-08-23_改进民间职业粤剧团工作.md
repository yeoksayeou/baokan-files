Improving the Work of Private Professional Cantonese Opera Troupes

    In order to implement the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government's "Instructions on Strengthening the Leadership and Management of Private Professional Theatrical Troupes" and to solve the existing problems of Cantonese opera troupes, the Guangdong and Guangzhou Municipal Opera Reform Committees recently convened a representative meeting of private professional Cantonese opera troupes. More than 360 people attended the meeting, including members of the Provincial and Municipal Opera Reform Committees, representatives from thirty private professional Cantonese opera troupes and performing arts circles such as Zhujiang, Dongfanghong, and Nanfang, as well as observers from state-owned Cantonese opera theaters in the city.

    The meeting pointed out that although Cantonese opera reform work has made some achievements in recent years, there are still many shortcomings. For example, up to now, there are still not many good repertoires of Cantonese opera, and the content of the repertoires is not broad enough; many Cantonese opera artists lack the spirit of hard work and diligent practice; Cantonese opera troupes also have wasteful phenomena such as bloated organization, huge expenses, and the inability to make good use of manpower. Therefore, Cantonese opera workers must continue to carry out ideological remolding, correct their labor attitude, strive to study their profession, and cultivate and establish the view of "thrift as glory, waste as shame" in order to improve the artistic level of Cantonese opera.

    At the meeting, after listening to special reports from responsible comrades in the literary and art circles and conducting group discussions, the representatives realized that the past ideas that acting does not require hard work and diligent practice, and that one can become a famous actor simply by using film, costumes, and constantly "jumping classes", as well as the practice of relying solely on mechanical scenery and strange play titles to attract audiences, were wrong. Only by constantly improving artistic quality and enriching performance content can we be welcomed by the audience. (Li Yi)

    改进民间职业粤剧团工作
    广东省、广州市戏曲改革委员会为了贯彻执行中央人民政府文化部“关于加强对民间职业剧团的领导和管理的指示”，并解决粤剧剧团目前存在的问题，最近召开了民间职业粤剧团代表会议。参加会议的有省、市戏曲改革委员会委员，珠江、东方红、南方等三十个民间职业粤剧团和曲艺界代表以及市内国营粤剧场的列席代表共三百六十多人。
  会议指出：近年来粤剧改革工作虽然作出了一些成绩，但是也还存在着不少缺点。例如到目前为止，粤剧界演出的好的剧目还不多，剧目内容也还不够广泛；不少粤剧艺人缺乏苦学苦练的精神；粤剧团也还有着编制臃肿、开支浩大、人力不能很好地利用等浪费现象。因此粤剧工作者必须继续进行思想改造，端正劳动态度，努力钻研业务，培养并树立“节约为荣、浪费为耻”的观点，以提高粤剧艺术水平。
    会上，听了文艺界负责同志的专题报告并进行了小组讨论后，代表们认识到过去认为演戏不需要苦学苦练，只要利用胶片、服装和不断“跳班”就可成为名演员的思想，以及只靠机关布景和奇怪的剧名来吸引观众的作法，都是错误的。而只有不断地提高艺术质量，丰富演出内容，才能受到观众的欢迎。  （李峄）
