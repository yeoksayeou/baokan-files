Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The flood situation in South Asian countries continues to worsen, with many places experiencing disasters unprecedented in decades or even in history.

According to India's "Statesman," the flood situation in Bihar province is severe. In the Tirhut region alone, seven million people have been affected, and in Darbhanga district, 600,000 people are affected. The "Indian Express" reports that due to the flooding of the Gandak River, Balan River, and Baihti River, the disaster situation in Bachhwara, Begusarai, Bariyarpur, and other areas in northeastern India is severe. In Begusarai, 3,000 houses have been flooded, 20,000 people are homeless, and crops in 50 villages have been submerged. In Mumbai, an important city on the Arabian Sea coast in western India, heavy rain fell at a rate of one inch per hour. Mumbai city and its suburbs have been submerged in deep water. Traffic in the city has come to a standstill due to the knee-deep water. Railways and aviation have also been suspended. The Narmada River in Central India Province has also flooded.

This year, the flood situation in East Pakistan is unprecedentedly severe. According to foreign news agencies, the water levels of the Brahmaputra River, the Yamuna River, and the Padma River are four to eight feet higher than the highest water levels in any previous period. According to Reuters, the disaster area in East Pakistan covers more than one-third of the entire area of East Bengal Province, which is 54,000 square miles. United Press International says that eight million people have moved to higher ground to avoid the disaster. Six million people have been forced to live on rooftops, tall trees, and train carriages, completely cut off from food and tap water supplies.

According to Agence France-Presse, Nepal's radio station quoted Nepal's Minister of Home Affairs and Transportation as saying that in eastern Nepal, the floods of the Bagmati River and the Kosi River have inundated an area of 7,000 square miles with a population of one million, and 10,000 people have been left homeless.

In Bago County, north of Yangon, the capital of Myanmar, floods have also occurred due to continuous heavy rain and rising water levels in nearby rivers.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: Japan experienced continuous heavy rain in July. By the end of the month, rivers had flooded one after another from the northern part of Kanto, through central Japan, to Kyushu, and many buildings were submerged in the floods.

According to incomplete statistics, in Kyushu, 3,277 houses and 1,758 cho (one cho is approximately 15 mu) of fields were flooded, 97 roads were cut off, and 201 landslides occurred.

The railway from Tokyo to Kobe has been unable to operate in several places due to the floods. At Nagoya Station, trains cannot go north because the embankment has collapsed. In addition, Nagano, Gunma, and other prefectures have also been hit by floods.

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 14th: TASS reported from Stockholm on the 13th: Stockholm newspapers reported that due to prolonged rainfall, rivers in Norrbotten Province have flooded, and some areas have been submerged. Crops in Skåne Province are threatened by floods. Due to the rain in Västergötland, it has been impossible to harvest crops and hay, which will cause great losses to animal husbandry. The same situation exists in Gothenburg-Bohus and Halland provinces.

    据印度“政治家报”报道，比哈尔省的水灾情况严重，在蒂尔赫特地区一处受灾的就有七百万人，在达板加县有六十万人。“印度快报”说，由于干达克河、巴拉尼河和巴伊蒂河的河水泛滥，在印度东北部的巴奇瓦拉、伯古萨拉伊、巴里雅普等地区的灾情严重。在伯古萨拉伊有三千座房屋被淹，两万人无家可归，五十个村庄的庄稼被淹没。在印度西部阿拉伯海沿岸的重要城市孟买降落了每小时达一英寸的暴雨，孟买市和郊区已浸在大水中。市内的交通由于水深过膝，已陷于停顿。铁路和航空也停顿了。在中央印度邦的纳巴达河，河水也泛滥成灾。
    今年东巴基斯坦的水情空前严重。据外国通讯社报道，布拉马普得拉河、雅玛河和帕德玛河的河水比过去任何时期的最高水位还要高四英尺到八英尺。据路透社说，东巴基斯坦受灾面积达东孟加拉省全省面积五万四千平方英里的三分之一以上。合众社说，有八百万人为了避灾已移到高地去。有六百万人被迫住在屋顶、高树和火车车厢上，他们完全断绝了粮食和自来水的供给。
    据法新社报道，尼泊尔广播电台引尼泊尔内务和运输大臣的话说，在尼泊尔东部地区，巴格马蒂河和柯西河的洪水浸入了一个七千平方英里、有一百万人口的地区，有一万人已无家可归。

    从东京到神户的铁路，有数处由于水灾不能通车，名古屋车站因为筑堤崩裂，火车不能北上。此外，长野、群马等县也都遭到水灾。
