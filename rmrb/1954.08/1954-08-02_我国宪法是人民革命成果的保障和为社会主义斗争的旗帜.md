    Our Constitution is a Guarantee of the People's Revolutionary Achievements and a Banner for the Socialist Struggle

    The draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been published, and after full discussion by the whole people, it will soon be submitted to the National People's Congress for adoption, becoming the first people's constitution of our country. This is a major event in the history of the Chinese People's Revolution.
    A constitution is the fundamental law of a country. It is the tool by which the ruling class of a country, according to its own will, uses legal forms to consolidate economic and political systems that are beneficial to its own class, in order to rule other classes. This kind of constitution was first created by the modern bourgeoisie after overthrowing the feudal class and seizing state power. For example, at the end of the 18th century, after the French bourgeoisie overthrew the feudal regime and climbed to the position of the ruling class, they formulated the 1791 Constitution. This constitution consolidated the achievements of the revolution against the feudal class, guaranteed the capitalist economic system and bourgeois democratic system, and assisted in the rule over the proletariat. Since then, the bourgeoisie in many countries, after defeating the feudal class, have followed the example of the French bourgeoisie and formulated similar bourgeois constitutions to rule the proletariat.
    Similarly, after the proletariat overthrows the bourgeoisie, establishes its own regime, and creates production relations that are beneficial to itself, it must also formulate its own constitution to consolidate the achievements of the revolution, guarantee the socialist economic system and proletarian democratic system, and serve as a tool for suppressing the overthrown bourgeoisie and landlord class. Lenin said: "After the working class seizes power, like all classes, it must maintain and protect power and consolidate power by changing property relations and enacting a new constitution." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Russian 4th edition, Vol. 30, p. 441) From this, it can be seen that the constitution of the working class is won by the working class through revolutionary means and is definitely not bestowed by anyone as charity. As Lenin said, "If we do not want to stand on the purely utopian and wishful-thinking standpoint, then we must say that we should estimate the experience of past years, and we should guarantee the constitution won by the revolution." ("Selected Works of Lenin," two-volume edition, Vol. 2, Moscow Chinese edition, pp. 681-682)
    Although the specific circumstances of our country's revolution are different from those of the Soviet Union, after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, the working class and the masses of the people in our country must also formulate their own constitution to consolidate the achievements of the revolution, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and ensure the construction of a socialist society in China.
    The "Common Program" promulgated in 1949 once played the role of a temporary constitution. However, at that time, the New Democratic Revolution had just basically ended, and the socialist revolution had just begun; the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the mainland were yet to be eliminated; the threat of American imperialist aggression still existed; bureaucratic capital had yet to be dealt with; land reform in the newly liberated areas had not yet been implemented, and the landlord class still existed; and the work of restoring financial and economic order had just begun. Therefore, the Common Program talked about things that did not yet exist, things that remained to be striven for. Now things are different. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country have carried out a series of struggles in the past five years, such as reforming the land system, resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, restoring the national economy, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and ideological remolding of intellectuals, and have achieved great victories. During this period, the people's democratic dictatorship has been consolidated, the national economy has been restored, and the proportion of the socialist economy in the entire national economy has increased. In 1953, our country began its First Five-Year Plan construction and clearly announced the general task of the state during the transition period. These great achievements in the five years since the founding of the country prove that the Common Program is completely correct and fully conforms to the interests and demands of the people of our country, but now some of it has been realized, and some of it is outdated. Due to the development of the socialist revolution and the changes in the balance of class forces, due to the great economic and political achievements since the founding of the country, and due to the increased socialist consciousness of the working class and the masses of the people, we must formulate the people's own constitution – the Constitution of the People's Republic of China – as the fundamental law of the state, to guarantee the achievements of the people's revolution and mobilize the people of the whole country to continue their efforts on the basis of the consolidated victory and struggle to build a socialist society.

    II
    There are two opposing types of constitutions in the world, namely capitalist constitutions and socialist constitutions. The foundation of a capitalist constitution is capitalist democracy, which consolidates capitalist ownership of the means of production and bourgeois democracy, i.e., the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The constitutions of the countries in the imperialist reactionary camp all belong to this type. The foundation of a socialist constitution is socialist democracy, which consolidates socialist ownership of the means of production and proletarian democracy, i.e., the dictatorship of the proletariat or the people's democratic dictatorship. The constitutions of the countries in the socialist peace and democracy camp all belong to this type.
    The Constitution of the People's Republic of China belongs to the socialist type, and it is a constitution based on socialist democracy.
    Perhaps some people will ask: Our country is still in the transition period from New Democracy to Socialism and is not yet a socialist country, so why do we say that our constitution is a socialist type of constitution? This is because our country is a country led by the working class represented by the Communist Party, and its general task during the transition period is to build socialism. Our constitution takes the general task of building socialism as its starting point, so it is a socialist type of constitution. Lenin, when speaking of the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic in the early days of its establishment, pointed out that saying it was socialist did not mean that socialism had already been realized within it, because at that time, this was still a future task; saying it was socialist was because the Soviet people had already embarked on this road, demonstrating their determination to implement the transition to socialism. Now, the working class and the masses of the people in our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have demonstrated their determination to implement the transition to socialism and have already embarked on this road.
    Lenin said in his book "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky": The Soviet Constitution "grew out of the development process of the class struggle, with the maturity of class contradictions." Similarly, our constitution, as mentioned above, also grew out of the process of class struggle, with the maturity of class contradictions. The constitution is the fundamental law of the state. Our country is the product of class struggle, and therefore our constitution is also the product of class struggle and is a record of the victory of class struggle. Therefore, the Constitution of our country, which belongs to the socialist type, must first stipulate the class basis of the state, that is, first determine the form of state. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "This issue of the form of state has been debated for decades since the end of the Qing Dynasty, but it has not been clarified. In fact, it only refers to one issue, namely the position of each class in the state. The bourgeoisie always conceals this class position and uses the term 'national' to achieve the reality of its class dictatorship. This concealment is of no benefit to the revolutionary people and should be clearly pointed out." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," 2nd edition, p. 669) Article 1 of the draft Constitution stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." This explains that the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class is the main body of our country. The worker-peasant alliance is the guarantee of the victory of the people's revolution and the victory of national construction in our country. In the past, we relied on this alliance to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China and achieved the victory of the people's democratic revolution in a country of 600 million people. After this revolutionary victory, that is, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, we must rely on this alliance under the leadership of the working class to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and build socialism. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Overthrowing imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries mainly relied on the strength of these two classes. The transition from New Democracy to Socialism mainly relies on the alliance of these two classes."
    Since the founding of New China, the balance of class forces has undergone significant changes. The running dogs of imperialism, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and the landlord class have been overthrown. The ranks of the working class are growing stronger and stronger. Under the leadership of the Party, the workers have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, launched a socialist labor competition on the production front, carried out movements to increase production and practice economy and technical innovation, and a large number of model workers have emerged, completing annual and quarterly plans ahead of schedule or exceeding quotas. This fully demonstrates the improvement of the socialist consciousness of the working class and establishes the prestige of the leading class. Secondly, under the leadership of the working class, the peasant class is increasingly accepting socialism. Now, nearly 100,000 agricultural production cooperatives have been organized, moving towards the future of agricultural collectivization. Thousands of activists have gloriously joined the ranks of the Party. The development and consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance guarantees the inevitable victory of socialism. Thirdly, the rich peasants in the countryside have been restricted, and the urban petty bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie have accepted the leadership of the working class. The draft Constitution reflects this new balance of class forces, stipulates the class basis of the state, and guarantees the working class's leadership over the state.

    III
    The draft Constitution reflects the economic relations of our country during the transition period, and it also reflects the laws of socio-economic development of our country during the transition period, which is the transformation of an economy with socialist ownership and non-socialist ownership coexisting into an economy with a single socialist ownership.
    The preamble to the draft Constitution first states that the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class "ensures that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society." Then it points out: "The general task of the state during the transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce." This is the peaceful road our country will take to reach socialist society.
    Since the founding of New China, the state has utilized the economic law that production relations must be suitable for the nature of the productive forces, confiscated bureaucratic capitalist enterprises and turned them into socialist enterprises, established the socialist state bank, and established socialist state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce throughout the country. Due to the formation of the socialist state-owned economy, the productive forces have achieved unprecedented development. Secondly, the state implemented the reform of the land system, confiscated the land of the landlords, and distributed it to the peasants with no or little land, liberating the productive forces in the countryside, and on this basis, led the peasants to gradually embark on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, thereby increasing agricultural production. Thirdly, the state has implemented a policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist enterprises, and has adopted measures of state capitalism; some private industrial and commercial enterprises have gradually been transformed into state capitalist enterprises, and their productive forces have improved compared to general capitalist enterprises. These policies and measures are aimed at gradually changing non-socialist production relations and promoting the development of productive forces. By 1952, the work of restoring the national economy had been completed. Because the state controlled the lifeline of the national economy, and the socialist state-owned economy had become the leading force in the national economy and the material basis for the state to realize socialist transformation, the basic economic laws of socialism began to play a role in the national economy. In order to develop production and ensure needs, the state, in accordance with the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy, formulated the First Five-Year Plan, which was implemented from 1953. The basic task of the Five-Year Plan is to concentrate major forces on developing heavy industry, establish the foundation for national industrialization and defense modernization; correspondingly train construction personnel, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and commerce; promote the cooperation of agriculture and handicrafts in a planned way, continue to transform capitalist industry and commerce, and at the same time correctly exert the positive role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce; ensure the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy, and ensure the gradual improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the people on the basis of developing production. At the time of the promulgation of the Constitution, our country was in the second year of the First Five-Year Plan. The draft Constitution reflects the actual situation of economic development during the transition period, lists four kinds of ownership, namely state ownership (ownership by the whole people), cooperative ownership, individual laborers' ownership, and capitalists' ownership; and stipulates the actual steps of the state's general task during the transition period, that is, the state guarantees the priority development of the socialist state-owned economy, promotes socialist industrialization, expands the material basis for socialist transformation, in order to continue to change non-socialist production relations into socialist production relations. The draft Constitution also stipulates that the state protects cooperative property, encourages, guides, and helps the development of the cooperative economy, and promotes the transformation of semi-socialist cooperatives into socialist cooperatives. The state protects the ownership of land, means of production, and other property of individual laborers according to law, and encourages them to voluntarily organize supply and marketing and credit cooperatives, especially production cooperatives; it adopts a policy of restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasants. The state protects the ownership of the means of production and other property of capitalists according to law, and at the same time encourages capitalist industry and commerce to gradually transform into various different forms of state capitalist economy, and gradually replace capitalist ownership with ownership by the whole people. If developed in this way, our country will gradually transition to a socialist society.
    The above is the specific path indicated by the draft Constitution for establishing a socialist society through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. This is completely in line with the laws of socio-economic development of our country during the transition period. Such a transformation is guaranteed, and this guarantee is the state organs and social forces, the leadership from top to bottom by the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, and the direct support from bottom to top by the workers and peasants.

    IV
    The draft Constitution also stipulates the political foundation of the state. This is the stipulation of our country's form of government. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The issue of the form of government refers to the issue of the form of organization of the regime, referring to the form in which a certain social class organizes its organs of power to oppose the enemy and protect itself. Without an appropriate form of organ of power, it cannot represent the state. China can now adopt a system of the National People's Congress, provincial people's congresses, county people's congresses, district people's congresses, and even township people's congresses, and governments are elected by people's congresses at all levels. However, it must implement a truly universal and equal election system without discrimination based on gender, religion, property, or education, in order to be suitable for the position of each revolutionary class in the state, suitable for expressing public opinion and directing the revolutionary struggle, and suitable for the spirit. This system is democratic centralism. Only a government with democratic centralism can fully exert the will of all revolutionary people and can most powerfully oppose the enemies of the revolution." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," 2nd edition, p. 670) Such democratic centralism is the principle of the revolutionary regime organization in the old liberated areas. At the time of the founding of the new state, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercised the functions and powers of the National People's Congress. In the five years since the founding of the country, people's representatives conferences have been held in various provinces and cities, which also exercised the functions and powers of local people's congresses. Experience has proven that the people's congress is the form of government that can best exert the power of the broad masses of the people to carry out revolution and construction. Therefore, the draft Constitution summarizes these experiences and stipulates that "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at various levels. The National People's Congress, the local people's congresses at various levels, and other state organs all practice democratic centralism." This shows that our country's form of government, our country's political foundation, is the people's congress which implements democratic centralism.
    The power of the People's Congress comes from the people and belongs to the people. The representatives of the People's Congress are elected by citizens who have reached the age of eighteen in a truly universal and equal manner, and are all those whom the voters consider satisfactory and necessary. If a representative violates the will of the people, the voters or the original electoral unit can remove them according to law. Therefore, the People's Congress is a power organ that can truly represent the will of the people.

    The draft Constitution stipulates that the National People's Congress is the highest organ of state power and the only organ that exercises state legislative power. It holds all power. Amending the Constitution, enacting laws, and all other major national policies are decided by it; the heads of state organs are produced by it, and it has the power to dismiss them.
    The National People's Congress, the local people's congresses at various levels, and other state organs all practice democratic centralism. Only by implementing democratic centralism "can we both express broad democracy, giving the people's congresses at all levels a high degree of power; and concentrate on handling state affairs, enabling governments at all levels to concentrate on handling all affairs entrusted to them by the people's congresses at all levels, and guaranteeing all necessary democratic activities of the people." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," 2nd edition, p. 1085)
    The National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at various levels are both state power organs and working organs. The National People's Congress not only formulates laws but also supervises the implementation of the Constitution. It organizes state organs and the masses of the people to implement the laws. It realizes the unity of legislative power and administrative power.
    The representatives of the People's Congress are mostly elected from workers, peasants, and urban residents, troops, and cadres. They bring the opinions of the masses to the congress; after the meeting, they bring the resolutions of the congress back to their work posts and convey them to their electoral units. This is coming from the masses and going to the masses. Therefore, our People's Congress can sensitively listen to the voices of the masses, implement the will of the people, and protect the interests of the people. Precisely because our power organs and administrative organs have a very broad mass base, they can attract the masses to participate in state management, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, formulate policies and plans that are in line with the interests of the masses, and complete the general task of socialist construction and socialist transformation.
    In order to complete the state's general task during the transition period, the people must implement the spirit of socialist democracy in all aspects of social, economic, political, and cultural life, that is, they must enjoy the various basic rights of citizens as stipulated in Chapter 3 of the Constitution, mobilize and organize themselves, participate in the work of the state's political, legal, financial, economic, and cultural aspects, exert a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, and contribute their wisdom and ability to build their own country. At the same time, the people must abide by the provisions of the Constitution, bear various obligations, abide by the Constitution and laws, abide by labor discipline, abide by public order, respect social ethics, cherish and protect public property, and pay taxes and perform military service in accordance with the law to defend our motherland. In our country, the interests of the state are consistent with the interests of the people, and the rights and obligations of the people are also consistent. This consistency will produce political unity among the people and will enable the people to jointly struggle to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and build the great cause of socialism.

    V
    In summary, our Constitution, proceeding from the specific practice and historical reality of the Chinese revolution, correctly reflects the laws of social development during the transition period and the general tasks of the state formulated in accordance with these laws, and points out the specific path for the working class and the working people to struggle to realize socialism. Therefore, this Constitution is a combination of Marxist-Leninist theory on constitutions and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and it is a constitution based on socialist democracy.
    Our Constitution was produced after the development of the material life of our society has put the new task of socialist revolution before society. Once it is produced, it will become a great force for mobilization, organization, and transformation. It can penetrate the consciousness of the masses of the people, mobilize and organize the masses of the people, eliminate all obstacles on the road forward, and solve this new task that has matured in the development of the material life of society. Once this draft Constitution is adopted by the National People's Congress and promulgated as a formal constitution, its smooth and thorough implementation is fully guaranteed. This full guarantee is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the enthusiastic support of the workers, peasants and other people. The Chinese Communist Party led the New Democratic Revolution in the past and achieved great victories; now it leads the socialist revolution and will surely achieve great victories as well. The socialist revolution is a serious class struggle. The "peaceful road" mentioned in the preamble to the draft Constitution only indicates that the completion of the socialist revolution will not be achieved through overthrowing the existing regime and establishing a new regime (because the regime is in the hands of the working class and the masses of the people), but the class struggle is still very serious. During the transition period, there are two basic contradictions in our country. The first is domestic, that is, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. The second is foreign, that is, the contradiction between the People's Republic of China and the imperialist countries. In the struggle of the socialist revolution, on the one hand, foreign imperialism will never sit idly by. On the other hand, those classes that have been overthrown domestically will never be reconciled to their own demise, and those classes that will be eliminated will not be without resistance. The resolute counter-revolutionary elements among them will inevitably collude with foreign imperialism, use every opportunity to undermine the cause of the Communist Party and the people, and attempt to make the Chinese revolution a failure and restore reactionary rule in China. Therefore, the working class and the working people must raise their vigilance under the leadership of the Party and carry out resolute class struggle against reactionary forces at home and abroad. Our Constitution is precisely a weapon of class struggle. Under the leadership of the Party, we must be good at grasping and using this sharp weapon to deal with enemies at home and abroad. The working class and the working people must recognize their class mission, abide by the Constitution and laws, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and protect the interests of socialism. At the same time, the working class and the working people must strive to develop production, strengthen national defense equipment, promote the modernization of national defense, and assume the sacred responsibility of defending the motherland, ready at any time to crush imperialist aggression and consolidate national independence and security.

    The various democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations in the people's democratic united front under the leadership of the Communist Party must, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, mobilize and unite the people of all nationalities throughout the country, oppose enemies at home and abroad, and complete the state's general task during the transition period. At the same time, the people of the whole country must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, strengthen friendship and unity with the people of the Soviet Union and the people of various people's democratic countries, as well as the peace-loving people of other countries, and form a broad international united front to oppose the danger of war and defend lasting peace in the world.
    Our Constitution is a banner for struggling for socialism. Under the leadership of the Party, we must hold this banner high and advance!

    我国宪法是人民革命成果的保障和为社会主义斗争的旗帜
    李达
    一
    中华人民共和国宪法草案公布了，在经过全民的充分讨论后，它即将提请全国人民代表大会通过，成为我国第一部人民的宪法，这是中国人民革命史上的重大事件。
    宪法是国家的根本大法。它是一个国家的统治阶级根据自己的意志，用法律形式巩固对本阶级有利的经济制度和政治制度，作为统治别的阶级的工具。这种意义的宪法，是近代资产阶级在推翻封建阶级掌握国家政权以后首创出来的。例如十八世纪末叶，法国资产阶级推翻封建政权爬上统治阶级地位以后，就制定了一七九一年的宪法。这个宪法巩固了反封建阶级的革命胜利的成果，保障了资本主义经济制度和资产阶级民主制度，帮助了对无产阶级的统治。从此以后，许多国家的资产阶级在战胜封建阶级以后，都仿效法国资产阶级的先例，制定同样的资产阶级宪法，借以统治无产阶级。
    同样，无产阶级在推翻资产阶级，建立自己的政权，创造对自己有利的生产关系以后，也要制定自己的宪法，来巩固革命胜利的成果，保障社会主义经济制度和无产阶级民主制度，作为镇压已被推翻的资产阶级和地主阶级的工具。列宁说过：“工人阶级在取得政权之后，像所有阶级一样，要以改变财产关系与新的宪法，来保持与保护政权，来巩固政权。”（“列宁全集”，俄文第四版，第三十卷，第四四一页）由此可见，工人阶级的宪法，是工人阶级用革命手段争取来的，决不是由什么人恩赐的。正如列宁所说，“我们若不愿站到纯粹空想和徒托空言的立场上，那我们就要说，我们应当估计已往年代的经验，我们应当保障革命所夺得的宪法”。（“列宁文选”两卷集，第二卷，莫斯科中文版，第六八一——六八二页）
    我国革命的具体情况虽然和苏联不同，但是我国工人阶级和人民群众在新民主主义革命的胜利以后，也必须制定自己的宪法，来巩固革命胜利的成果，巩固人民民主专政，并保证在中国建成社会主义社会。
    一九四九年公布的“共同纲领”曾经起过临时宪法的作用。但当时新民主主义革命刚刚基本结束，社会主义革命刚刚开始；大陆上蒋介石匪帮残余势力尚待肃清；美帝国主义侵略的威胁依然存在；官僚资本尚待处理；新解放区土地改革还未实行，地主阶级依然存在；财政经济的恢复工作刚刚开始。所以共同纲领中所说的是尚不存在的东西，是有待于争取其实现的东西。现在不同了。全国人民近五年来在中国共产党领导之下，进行了改革土地制度、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、恢复国民经济、“三反”、“五反”运动、知识分子思想改造等一系列的斗争，取得了伟大的胜利。在这一段时期中，人民民主专政巩固了，国民经济恢复了，社会主义经济在整个国民经济中的比重增长了。在一九五三年，我国开始了第
  一个五年计划建设，明确宣布了国家在过渡时期的总任务。建国五年来这些伟大的成就，证明了共同纲领是完全正确的，是完全符合我国人民的利益和要求的，但现在其中有些东西已经实现了，有些东西已经过时了。由于社会主义革命形势的发展和阶级力量对比关系的变化，由于建国以来经济上政治上的伟大成就，由于工人阶级和人民群众社会主义觉悟的提高，我们必须制定人民自己的宪法——中华人民共和国宪法，作为国家的根本法，来保障人民革命胜利的成果，并动员全国人民在已巩固的胜利的基础上继续努力，为建成社会主义社会而斗争。二
    世界上有两种敌对类型的宪法，即资本主义类型的宪法与社会主义类型的宪法。资本主义类型宪法的基础是资本主义民主制，它巩固生产资料的资本主义所有制和资产阶级民主，即资产阶级专政。帝国主义反动阵营中各国的宪法，都属于这一类型。社会主义类型的宪法的基础是社会主义民主制，它巩固生产资料的社会主义所有制和无产阶级民主，即无产阶级专政或人民民主专政。社会主义和平民主阵营中各国的宪法，都属于这一类型。
    中华人民共和国宪法属于社会主义类型，它是以社会主义民主制为基础的宪法。
    或许有人要问：我们的国家还处在由新民主主义到社会主义的过渡期，还不是社会主义国家，为什么说我们的宪法是社会主义类型的宪法呢？这是因为我们的国家是以共产党为代表的工人阶级所领导的国家，它在过渡时期的总任务，是要建成社会主义。我们的宪法是以建成社会主义的总任务为出发点的，所以它是社会主义类型的宪法。列宁在俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国成立初期，说到俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国时，曾经指出，说它是社会主义的，并不是因为它内部已经实现了社会主义，因为在当时，这还是一个将来的任务；说它是社会主义的，是因为苏联人民已经走上了这条道路，表现了实行过渡到社会主义的决心。现在，我国工人阶级和人民群众在共产党领导之下，已经表现了实行过渡到社会主义的决心，并且已经走上了这条道路。
    列宁在“无产阶级革命与叛徒考茨基”一书中说：苏维埃宪法“是从阶级斗争发展进程中，随着阶级矛盾成熟程度而成长起来的。”同样，我们的宪法，如上文所述，也是从阶级斗争进程中，随着阶级矛盾成熟程度成长起来的。宪法是国家的根本大法。我们的国家是阶级斗争的产物，因而我们的宪法也是阶级斗争的产物，并且是阶级斗争胜利成果的纪录。所以属于社会主义类型的我国宪法，首先要规定国家的阶级基础，这就是说首先要确定我国的国体。毛泽东同志说：“这个国体问题，从前清末年起，闹了几十年还没有闹清楚。其实，它只是指的一个问题，就是社会各阶级在国家中的地位。资产阶级总是隐瞒这种阶级地位，而用‘国民’的名词达到其一阶级专政的实际。这种隐瞒，对于革命的人民，毫无利益，应该为之清楚地指明。”（“毛泽东选集”，第二版，第六六九页）宪法草案第一条规定：“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。”这便是说明，工人阶级领导的工农联盟是我们国家的主体。工农联盟是我国人民革命胜利和国家建设胜利的保证。过去我们依靠这个联盟推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，在六万万人的国家中取得了人民民主革命的胜利。在这一革命胜利之后，即在中华人民共和国成立以后，我们又要依靠这个在工人阶级领导之下的联盟来巩固人民民主专政并建设社会主义，所以毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中说：“推翻帝国主义与国民党反动派，主要是这两个阶级的力量。由新民主主义到社会主义，主要依靠这两个阶级的联盟。”
    新中国成立以来，阶级力量的对比关系起了显著的变化。帝国主义走狗、官僚资产阶级和地主阶级已被推翻了。工人阶级队伍日趋于成长与壮大。工人们在党的领导下，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，在生产战线上展开着社会主义劳动竞赛，进行着增产节约和技术革新运动，涌现了大批劳动模范，提前或超额完成了年度计划和季度计划。这充分表现着工人阶级社会主义觉悟的提高，树立了领导阶级的声望。其次，农民阶级在工人阶级的领导之下，日益接受社会主义，现在已经组织了近十万个农业生产合作社，向着农业集体化的前途迈进。成千上万的积极分子，光荣地加入了党的队伍。工农联盟的发展和巩固，保证着社会主义的必然胜利。再次，乡村的富农已经受到了限制，城市小资产阶级和资产阶级已经接受了工人阶级的领导。宪法草案反映了这种阶级力量的新的对比关系，规定了国家的阶级基础，并保证着工人阶级对于国家的领导权。三
    宪法草案反映了我国过渡时期的经济关系，同时也反映了我国过渡时期社会经济发展的规律，这便是由社会主义所有制与非社会主义所有制并存的经济转变为单一的社会主义所有制的经济。
    宪法草案序言首先表明：工人阶级领导的人民民主专政的政权，“保证我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会”。接着指出：“国家在过渡时期的总任务，是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。”这就是我国到达社会主义社会所通过的和平的道路。
    新中国成立以来，国家利用生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个经济法则，没收了官僚资本主义企业使之变为社会主义的企业，建立了社会主义的国家银行，并在全国范围内建立了社会主义国营商业和合作社商业。由于社会主义国营经济的形成，生产力获得了空前的发展。其次，国家实行了改革土地制度，没收了地主的土地，分配给无地少地的农民，解放了农村的生产力，并在此基础上，领导农民逐步走上了互助合作的道路，因而提高了农业生产。再次，国家对资本主义企业实行利用、限制和改造的政策，采取了国家资本主义的措施；有些私人工商业已经逐步改变为国家资本主义企业，其生产力比较一般资本主义企业都提高了。这些政策和措施，就是要逐步改变非社会主义的生产关系，促进生产力的发展。到一九五二年，国民经济的恢复工作已经完成。由于国家掌握了国家经济命脉，社会主义国营经济已成为国民经济中的领导力量和国家实现社会主义改造的物质基础，于是社会主义的基本经济法则在国民经济中开始发生了作用。为了发展生产，保证需要，国家就依照国民经济有计划的按比例的发展法则，制订了第一个五年计划，从一九五三年起付之实行。五年计划的基本任务是集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础；相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和商业；有步骤地促进农业、手工业的合作化，继续进行对资本主义工商业的改造，同时正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的积极作用；保证国民经济中社会主义成分的比重稳步增长，保证在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民物质和文化生活的水平。在宪法颁布时，我国已是第一个五年计划的第二年。宪法草案反映了过渡时期经济发展的实际情况，列举了四种所有制，即国家所有制（全民所有制）、合作社所有制、个体劳动者所有制、资本家所有制；规定了国家过渡时期的总任务的实际步骤，即国家保证优先发展社会主义国营经济，促进社会主义工业化，扩大社会主义改造的物质基础，以便继续进行改变非社会主义的生产关系为社会主义的生产关系。宪法草案还规定：国家保护合作社财产，鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展，并促使半社会主义性质的合作社转变为社会主义合作社。国家依法保护个体劳动者的土地、生产资料及其他财产所有权，鼓励他们自愿组织供销和信用合作社，特别是组织生产合作社；对于富农则采取限制和逐步消灭的政策。国家依法保护资本家的生产资料及其他财产所有权，同时鼓励资本主义工商业逐步转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济，逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制。照这样发展下去，我国就将逐步过渡到社会主义社会。
    以上是宪法草案所指示的通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，建立社会主义社会的具体道路。这完全是符合于我国过渡时期社会经济的发展规律的。这样的转变是有保证的，这个保证就是国家机关和社会力量，就是工人阶级领导的人民民主专政的政权从上而下地领导和工农群众从下而上的直接支持。四
    宪法草案还规定着国家的政治基础。这就是规定我国的政体。毛泽东同志说：“政体问题，那是指的政权构成的形式问题，指的一定的社会阶级取何种形式去组织那反对敌人保护自己的政权机关。没有适当形式的政权机关，就不能代表国家。中国现在可以采取全国人民代表大会、省人民代表大会、县人民代表大会、区人民代表大会直到乡人民代表大会的系统，并由各级代表大会选举政府。但必须实行无男女、信仰、财产、教育等差别的真正普遍平等的选举制，才能适合于各革命阶级在国家中的地位，适合于表现民意和指挥革命斗争，适合于新民主主义的精神。这种制度即是民主集中制。只有民主集中制的政府，才能充分地发挥一切革命人民的意志，也才能最有力量地去反对革命的敌人。”（“毛泽东选集”，第二版，第六七○页）这样的民主集中制是从前老解放区革命政权组织的原则。新国家成立时，中国人民政治协商会议就执行着全国人民代表大会的职权。建国五年来，各省市都召开了各界人民代表会议，也代行了地方人民代表大会的职权。经验证明：人民代表大会是最能发挥广大人民的力量进行革命与建设的政体。所以宪法草案总结这些经验，规定“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。全国人民代表大会、地方各级人民代表大会和其他国家机关，一律实行民主集中制。”这就表明，我国的政体，我国的政治基础，是实行民主集中制的人民代表大会。
    人民代表大会的权力，来自人民，并属于人民。人民代表大会的代表，是由年满十八岁的公民真正普遍平等地选出的，都是选民所认为满意的和必要的人。代表如果违反人民意志，选民或原选举单位可以依法撤换。所以人民代表大会是真正能够代表人民意志的权力机关。
    宪法草案规定：全国人民代表大会是最高国家权力机关，又是行使国家立法权的唯一机关。它握有全部权力。修改宪法，制定法律及其他一切国家大政都由它决定；国家机关的首长都由它产生，它并有权罢免。
    全国人民代表大会、地方各级人民代表大会和其他国家机关，一律实行民主集中制。只有实行民主集中制“才既能表现广泛的民主，使各级人民代表大会有高度的权力；又能集中处理国事，使各级政府能集中地处理被各级人民代表大会所委托的一切事务，并保障人民的一切必要的民主活动。”
  （“毛泽东选集”，第二版，第一○八五页）
      全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会，是国家权力机关，又是工作机关。全国人民代表大会，不单是制定法律，并且监督宪法的实施。它组织国家机关和人民群众来执行法律。它实现着立法权与行政权的统一。
    人民代表大会的代表，大都是从工农和市民、部队、干部中选出的，他们带着群众的意见出席大会；会毕以后，又带着大会的决议回到工作岗位，对自己的选举单位作传达，这就是从群众中来，到群众中去。所以我们的人民代表大会，能够敏感地听取群众的呼声，执行人民的意志，保护人民的利益。正因为我们的权力机关和行政机关具有极广泛的群众基础，所以能够吸引群众参加国家管理，能够集中群众的智慧，制定切合于群众利益的政策和计划，完成社会主义建设和社会主义改造的总任务。
      为了完成国家在过渡时期的总任务，人民在社会的、经济的、政治的、文化的生活各方面，必须贯彻社会主义民主主义的精神，即必须享有如宪法第三章所规定的公民的各种基本权利，动员起来并组织起来，参加国家的政法、财经和文化各方面的工作，发挥出高度的积极性和创造性，贡献出自己的智慧和能力，来建设自己的国家。同时，人民必须遵照宪法的规定，担负各种义务，遵守宪法和法律，遵守劳动纪律，遵守公共秩序，尊重社会公德，爱护和保卫公共财产，依法纳税、服兵役，来保卫我们的祖国。在我们的国家里，国家的利益与人民的利益是一致的，人民的权利与义务也是一致的。这样的一致，就会产生出人民在政治上的一致，就会使人民共同为巩固人民民主专政和建成社会主义的伟大事业而奋斗。五
    综上所述，我们的宪法从中国革命的具体实践和历史实际出发，正确地反映了过渡时期社会的发展规律以及根据这规律而制订的国家的总任务，指出了工人阶级和劳动人民为实现社会主义而斗争的具体道路。所以这个宪法是马克思列宁主义关于宪法的理论和中国革命的具体实践的结合，它是以社会主义民主制为基础的宪法。
    我们的宪法是在我国社会物质生活的发展已在社会面前提出社会主义革命的新任务之后产生出来的。它一经产生出来，就会成为动员、组织和改造的伟大力量。它能够深入人民群众的意识，使人民群众动员起来，组织起来，扫除前进路途上的一切障碍，解决这个在社会物质生活发展过程中业已成熟的新任务。这个宪法草案一经全国人民代表大会通过作为正式宪法颁布以后，它的顺利地彻底地实施，是有充分的保证的。这充分的保证，就是中国共产党的领导与工农群众的热诚的拥护和支持。中国共产党过去领导新民主主义革命，取得了伟大的胜利；现在领导社会主义革命，也必能取得伟大的胜利。社会主义革命是一场严重的阶级斗争。宪法草案序言中所说的“和平的道路”，只是表明社会主义革命任务的完成不是经过推翻现存政权和建立新政权来实现（因为政权掌握在工人阶级和人民群众手里），但阶级斗争仍是很严重的。在过渡时期中，我国存有两种基本矛盾。第一种是国内的，即工人阶级与资产阶级的矛盾。第二种是国外的，即中华人民共和国与帝国主义国家的矛盾。在社会主义革命的斗争中，一方面，外国帝国主义，决不会袖手旁观。另一方面，国内那些已被打倒的阶级决不会甘心于自己的死亡，那些将被消灭的阶级决不会没有反抗，他们中的坚决反革命分子必然要和外国帝国主义勾结起来，利用每一个机会来破坏共产党和人民的事业，企图使中国革命事业归于失败，使反动统治在中国复辟。因此，工人阶级和劳动人民必须在党的领导下提高警惕，对国内外反动派实行坚决的阶级斗争。我们的宪法正是阶级斗争的武器。我们必须在党的领导下，善于掌握和运用这个犀利的武器来对付国内外的敌人。工人阶级和劳动人民必须认清自己阶级的使命，遵守宪法和法律，来巩固人民民主专政，保障社会主义的利益。同时工人阶级和劳动人民必须努力发展生产，加强国防设备，促进国防现代化，并担负起保卫祖国的神圣职责，随时准备粉碎帝国主义的进攻，巩固国家的独立与安全。
    在共产党领导下的人民民主统一战线中的各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体，必须按照宪法的规定，动员和团结全国各民族人民，反对国内外的敌人，完成国家在过渡时期的总任务。同时，全国人民必须在共产党的领导下，与苏联人民和各人民民主国家的人民，以及其他国家爱好和平的人民，加强友谊与团结，组成广大的国际统一战线，来反对战争危险，来保卫世界的持久和平。
    我们的宪法是为社会主义而奋斗的旗帜，我们要在党的领导下，高举着这面旗帜前进！
