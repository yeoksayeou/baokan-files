    At the Home of a People's Representative
    Wang Mupeng
    Article 17 of the Draft Constitution stipulates: All state organs must rely on the people, maintain close ties with the masses, listen to their opinions, and accept their supervision. Comrade Gong Zhiyuan (Secretary of the Lingqian District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Dalian City), since being elected as a people's representative, has been adhering to this spirit by regularly receiving constituents at his home every Sunday.
    At a quarter past seven on the evening of August 1st, Comrade Gong Zhiyuan had cleaned up his house, ready to receive constituents.
    On this day, the first person to arrive at the people's representative's home was sanitation worker Tian Shufeng. He had worked hard all day, and was very tired, but remembering that today was the day the people's representative received constituents, he put down his rice bowl and came to Comrade Gong Zhiyuan's home.
    "You've come, please sit down," Comrade Gong Zhiyuan shook hands warmly with him and poured him a glass of water. Tian Shufeng took it without hesitation and said, "Representative Gong, I have two things to talk to you about. I have two opinions about the Bayi Road Cooperative: one is that they throw rotten fish and vegetables outside. We clean it up one day, and the next day they throw another pile; the other opinion is that they don't cherish the people's property. The vegetables they bring from the market are not graded, good and bad mixed together, and sold at the same price. In a few days, the rotten ones can't be sold and have to be thrown away, wasting so much." He also said that although he had raised these issues with them several times in the past, they had no effect. The salesperson even said, "Haul your dirty soil, mind your own business."
    Comrade Gong Zhiyuan immediately wrote down these opinions and said, "The property of the cooperative is the property of the people. Your spirit of caring for the people's property is very good. I hope you will continue to offer opinions in the future." Comrade Gong Zhiyuan promised to pass these issues on to the director of the cooperative and ask them to examine their work.
    After this matter was over, Tian Shufeng asked Representative Gong if the farmers of Xinqi Village could use dirty soil as fertilizer. Comrade Gong Zhiyuan said, "Yes, but the farmers must clean it up and not affect public hygiene." While the two of them were talking animatedly, Yu Jinying arrived with her three children. Tian Shufeng felt that his problem had been solved, so he stood up and said to the newcomers, "My problem is solved, you talk." With that, he bid farewell to the people's representative.
    Yu Jinying is a nurse who is resting at home because of illness. The reason she came to the people's representative today was because she had an opinion about a people's police officer. She lives downstairs at No. 29, Building 2, Bayi Road. Upstairs lives Yang Zhenyou, a people's police officer from Bayi Road. When Yang Zhenyou mops the floor upstairs, his wife carelessly washes diapers for the children, and the water flows down the floor cracks into their kitchen downstairs, sometimes like rain, so they can't even cook. Yu Jinying had talked to Comrade Yang about this matter, asking him to be more careful, but Comrade Yang said, "The sewer is broken, how can you blame me?" After she told this story, Comrade Gong Zhiyuan thought: This is a matter related to the interests of the masses, so he wrote this opinion in the guestbook and said kindly, "I will go and see it tomorrow and pass your opinion on to the Public Security Bureau."
    At 8:40, Cui Fugui, an employee of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company, arrived. He saw the light in the representative's room outside the door, and heard voices, so he knew the representative was not asleep. There were four or five people sitting in the room, talking lively, so he came in. Comrade Gong Zhiyuan greeted him warmly, "Come in, Comrade Cui Fugui." Cui Fugui smiled and sat down in the chair next to the writing desk. After Representative Gong finished talking with other constituents, Cui Fugui said, "Representative Gong, the sanitation work in our neighborhood is still a bit formalistic and not closely monitored. The first committee has more than 30 households, but the people who sweep the streets are never all there. There is a lack of inspection in this area of work." Comrade Gong Zhiyuan felt that this opinion would be of great help in improving sanitation work. He decided to pass this opinion on to the Health Section of the District People's Government.
    Then Comrade Gong Zhiyuan and Comrade Cui Fugui discussed the situation of factory production. Cui Fugui told him that, encouraged by the Draft Constitution, the enthusiasm for production in the factory is even higher. Now the workers want to create new production achievements and offer them as a gift to the first session of the First People's Congress of Dalian City.
    Since being elected as a people's representative, Gong Zhiyuan has often received constituents. Finding the people's representative and talking to them at their home has become a common occurrence for the constituents of the first electoral district of Bayi Road. Workers, staff, cadres, and housewives in this electoral district often visit him to report bad people and bad deeds and to reflect the people's demands. Some residents' committee members also come to him to discuss the work of street residents.
    The constituents feel very happy when they tell their demands to the people's representative. Therefore, many people have recently reported situations to the people's representative, Gong Zhiyuan. I saw in Comrade Gong Zhiyuan's "Registration Book for Receiving Constituents" the following statistics: ten opinions on municipal construction, six on the work style of cadres, six on the lives of the masses, one on children's welfare, twelve on real estate companies, and two on social issues, a total of thirty-seven items. Thirty-five items have been resolved so far, and two are being processed.

### 在一个人民代表的家里

    在一个人民代表的家里
    王慕鹏
    宪法草案第十七条规定：一切国家机关必须依靠人民群众，经常保持同群众的密切联系，倾听群众意见，接受群众监督。宫志远同志（中共旅大市岭前区区委书记），自从被选为人民代表以后，正是根据这种精神在每个星期天，照例要在自己的家里接待选民。
    八月一日傍晚七点刚过一刻，宫志远同志就把屋子收拾得干干净净，准备接待选民了。
    这天，第一个来到人民代表家里的是清扫工人田叔凤。白天，他干了一天活，够累的了，但是想起今天是人民代表接待选民的日子，扔下饭碗，就到宫志远同志家里来了。
    “你来了，快坐下吧。”宫志远同志热情地和他握手，又倒了一杯水递给他。田叔凤毫不拘束地接过来，说道：“宫代表，我有两件事和你讲讲。我对八一路合作社有两个意见：一个是他们把臭鱼烂菜扔在外面，我们头天收拾了，第二天他们又扔了一堆；再一个意见就是他们拿着人民的财产不心疼，从市场拉来的青菜，不分等级，好坏搅在一起，都是一个价钱卖。过两天烂的卖不出去就得扔，不知糟蹋了多少。”他又说，过去虽然向他们提过几次意见，可是都不起作用。营业员甚至还说：“拉你的脏土，少管闲事。”
    宫志远同志立刻把这些意见记下来，并说：“合作社的财产是人民的财产，你这种关心人民财产的精神是很好的。希望你今后继续提意见。”宫志远同志答应将这些问题转给合作社主任，叫他们检查一下工作。
    这件事结束了，田叔凤又问宫代表，新起屯的农民要用脏土当肥料，是不是可以给。宫志远同志说：“可以给，但是要叫农民都收拾好，不要影响公共卫生。”他们两个正谈得津津有味的时候，于金英领着她的三个孩子来了。田叔凤觉得自己的问题已经解决，便起身向刚来的人说：“我的问题解决了，你们谈吧。”说着就向人民代表告辞了。
    于金英是护士，因为有病在家休养。今天所以来找人民代表，是因为她对一个人民警察有意见。她住在八一路二委二十九号楼下，楼上住的是八一路的人民警察杨振有。杨振有在楼上刷地板，他爱人给孩子洗尿布，用水不经心，都顺着地板缝流到楼下他们家的厨房里，有时就像下雨一样，连饭都不能做。于金英曾经找杨同志谈过这件事，请他仔细点，可是杨同志说：“下水道坏了还能怨我？”她将这事讲了以后，宫志远同志想：这是关系群众利益的事情，于是就把这意见记在留言簿上，和蔼地说：“明天我去看看，把你的意见转到公安分局。”
    八点四十分，中苏造船公司职工崔福贵来了。他在门外看见代表屋子里的灯光还亮着，有谈话的声音，就知道代表还没有睡。屋里坐着四五个人谈的挺热闹，他也就进来了。宫志远同志亲热地和他打招呼：“来吧，崔福贵同志。”崔福贵笑了笑，就坐在写字台旁边的椅子上。当宫代表结束了和别的选民的谈话后，崔福贵就说：“宫代表，咱们街道的卫生工作还有些形式主义，抓的不紧。第一委住了三十多户，可是扫大街的时候人去的总是不齐全。这方面的工作缺乏检查。”宫志远同志感觉这意见对改进卫生工作帮助很大。他决定把这个意见转到区人民政府卫生科去。
    接着宫志远同志又和崔福贵同志谈论起工厂生产的情形。崔福贵告诉他说：在宪法草案的鼓舞下，工厂里生产热情更加高涨。现在工人们都要创造新的生产成绩，向旅大市第一届第一次人民代表大会会议献礼。
    宫志远从当选为人民代表以后，就经常接待选民。有事找人民代表、到人民代表家去谈谈，已成为八一路第一选区选民的常事。这个选区的工人、职员、干部和家庭妇女，经常来访问他，向他检举坏人坏事、反映人民要求。有些居民委员还来和他研究街道居民工作问题。
  选民把自己的要求告诉给人民代表，心里就觉得非常愉快，因此，最近向人民代表宫志远反映情况的很多。我看到在宫志远同志的“接待选民登记簿”上，有过这样的统计：有关市政建设的意见十件，有关干部作风的六件，有关群众生活的六件，有关儿童福利的一件，有关房产公司的十二件，有关社会问题的两件，共计三十七件，到现在已解决了三十五件，还有两件正在处理。
