Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 5th. The Huai River Project has played a significant role in this year's Huai River flood control efforts. Currently, the flood storage and detention areas in the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River have intercepted 20 billion cubic meters of floodwater, thus ensuring the safety of many dikes and reducing the damage from this year's Huai River floods.

After the Huai River entered the flood season this year, the Huai River Flood Control Headquarters systematically utilized the Huai River Project for flood storage, flood interception, flood diversion, flood detention, and flood discharge. The Shihmantan, Banqiao, Baisha, and Boshan reservoirs and the Laowangpo, Wusong Lake, Jiaoting Lake, and Tonghu depressions in the upper reaches of the Huai River in Henan Province, as well as the Foziling Reservoir and the Menghe Depression, Chengxi Lake, Chengdong Lake, Mengjia Lake, Jiangjia Lake, Qiujia Lake, Tangduo Lake, Wabuhu Lake, and Hongze Lake between Anhui and Jiangsu in the middle reaches of the Huai River, have all completely intercepted and stored large amounts of floodwater. After water storage, the flood peaks of the Huai River's main stream and many tributaries have been greatly reduced. The river regulation projects within the Huai River Project have also begun to demonstrate significant benefits in flood control. The regulated river channels have increased drainage capacity and drainage speed compared to the past, and the dikes have also become more solid. Before the regulation of the Hong River and Ru River in the upper reaches of the Huai River, the old riverbeds could only handle 500 cubic meters per second of floodwater. If this was exceeded, flooding would occur. This year, the Hong River and Ru River safely passed 1,050 cubic meters per second of floodwater. After the completion of the diversion projects in the main and tributary streams in the middle reaches of the Huai River, the water level of the Huai River's main stream was 1.5 meters higher than the water level of the tributary streams this year, but the Huai River water did not flow backward. The Gaoliangjian water inlet gate in the lower reaches of the Huai River was opened, and a portion of the Huai River floodwater flowed directly into the Yellow Sea through the Subei Irrigation Main Canal at a flow rate of over 700 cubic meters per second. The massive Sanhe Sluice Gate on the bank of Hongze Lake controlled the discharge flow of the Huai River floodwater, greatly reducing the threat of the Huai River flood to the canal dikes in northern Jiangsu.

This year, the rainfall in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River Basin has been particularly heavy. From the beginning of July to the present, large areas in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River Basin have experienced heavy rainfall. The rainfall in one month is equivalent to or even exceeds the past year's rainfall in the Huai River Basin. The average annual rainfall in the Huai River Basin is about 700 to 1,000 millimeters. This year, in less than a month in July, the rainfall in the areas with the most rainfall has exceeded 1,200 millimeters. The rainfall in Shenqiu in Henan Province and Wangjiaba, Runheji, and Fuliji in Anhui Province has reached about 900 millimeters. The total amount of the Huai River flood this year has exceeded the flood volume in 1950 by 20 billion cubic meters, and the rainfall has exceeded 1950 by 18 billion cubic meters. Currently, the water levels of the main stream and tributaries of the Huai River above Bengbu have all exceeded the guaranteed water level. In many places, it has exceeded the highest water level on record. For example, the water level in Zhengyangguan, Anhui Province, on July 26 exceeded the highest historical water level by 1.64 meters. The water level in Bengbu at 5:00 on August 5 exceeded the highest historical water level by 0.95 meters. This year's Huai River flood has been large, fierce, and sustained. The magnitude of the flood far exceeds not only 1950 but also the record of 1931. In 1931, such a massive flood caused widespread flooding in the Huai River Basin, cutting off the Jinpu Railway and breaching the dikes of the Subei Canal. The flood rushed down from Henan and Anhui, turning the Su-Wan Plain into a vast expanse of water. However, this year, except for some areas where the water was too strong and human power was temporarily unable to resist, resulting in dike breaches and waterlogging disasters, most of the dikes have stood firm, thus ensuring the safety of large areas, cities, and railways.

Because the entire Huai River harnessing project has not yet been fully completed, and this year we have encountered an exceptionally large flood, the Huai River projects carried out in the past few years have over-fulfilled their task of defending against floods. Therefore, this year's Huai River flood control work has been particularly arduous and tense. Currently, hundreds of thousands of flood control workers along the Huai River are making persistent efforts to prepare to overcome even greater floods.

### 治淮工程在防汛中发挥重大作用  保障了堤防安全，减轻了洪水灾害

    治淮工程在防汛中发挥重大作用
    保障了堤防安全，减轻了洪水灾害
      【新华社蚌埠五日电】治淮工程在今年淮河防汛中起了重大作用。目前淮河上、中游的蓄洪、滞洪地区已拦滞洪水达二百亿立方公尺，因而保证许多堤防的安全，减轻了今年淮河洪水的灾害。
    今年淮河步入汛期后，淮河防汛指挥机关就有计划地利用治淮工程，蓄洪、拦洪、分洪、滞洪、行洪。淮河上游河南省的石漫滩、板桥、白沙、薄山等水库和老王坡、吴宋湖、蛟停湖、潼湖等洼地蓄洪工程，淮河中游安徽省的佛子岭水库和濛河洼地、城西湖、城东湖、孟家湖、姜家湖、邱家湖、唐垛湖、瓦埠湖以及安徽、江苏之间的洪泽湖都已全部拦蓄了大量洪水。蓄水后淮河干流和许多支流的洪峰便大大降低。治淮工程中的河道整理工程，在防汛中也开始发挥显著的效益，已经整理过的河道，排水量都比过去加大，排水速度比过去加快，堤防也比过去巩固。淮河上游洪河、汝河未整理前，旧有河床只能通过五百秒公方的洪水。如果超过，就要泛滥成灾。今年洪河、汝河便安全通过了一千零五十秒公方的洪水。淮河中游干支流分流工程完工后，今年淮河干流的水位超过支流水位一点五公尺，但淮水并未倒灌。淮河下游高良涧进水闸开闸，淮河的一部分洪水以每秒七百公方以上的流量，由苏北灌溉总渠直接流入黄海。洪泽湖畔巨大的三河闸控制了淮河洪水下泄的流量，大大减轻了淮河洪水对江苏北部运河堤防的威胁。
    今年淮河流域上、中、下游的雨量特别大。从七月初到现在一个月来，淮河流域上、中、下游的广大地区都下了大雨。一个月的雨量相当甚至超过了淮河流域过去一年的雨量。淮河流域常年一年的降雨量是七百公厘到一千公厘左右，今年七月份不到一个月的时间，降雨最多的地方已超过一千二百公厘。河南省沈邱、安徽省王家坝、润河集、符离集等地降雨量都已达九百公厘左右。今年淮河洪水总量已超过一九五零年洪水量二百亿公方，降雨量超过一九五零年一百八十亿公方。目前蚌埠以上淮河干流和支流的水位已全部超过了保证水位。很多地方已超过了历史上有纪录的最高水位。如安徽省正阳关七月二十六日的水位，就超过历史上最高水位一点六四公尺。蚌埠八月五日五时的水位，超过历史上最高水位零点九五公尺。今年淮河洪水来势既大又猛，而且持久。洪水之大不仅远远超过一九五零年，而且超过了一九三一年的纪录。一九三一年这样巨大的洪水曾经在淮河流域全面泛滥成灾，冲断了津浦铁路，冲破了苏北运河堤防。洪水从河南、安徽直冲而下，苏皖平原一片汪洋。但今年淮河流域除部分地区由于水势太大，人力一时无法抗拒而发生决堤和内涝灾害外，大部堤防至今屹立未动，因而保障了大片地区和城市、铁路的安全。
    由于根治淮河的整个工程还没有全部完成，今年又遭遇了特大洪水，过去几年来已进行的治淮工程，已超额地担负了它们防御洪水的任务，因此今年淮河防汛工作显得特别艰苦，也特别紧张。目前沿淮数十万防汛民工，正再接再厉准备战胜更大的洪水。
