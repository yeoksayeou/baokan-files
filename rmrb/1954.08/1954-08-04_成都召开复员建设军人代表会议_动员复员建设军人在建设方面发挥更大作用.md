Chengdu Holds Meeting of Demobilized and Construction Soldiers
    Mobilizing Them to Play a Greater Role in Construction

    The city of Chengdu convened a meeting of representatives of demobilized and construction soldiers on July 21st and 22nd. The meeting summarized the resettlement work for demobilized and construction soldiers over the past two years and mobilized all demobilized and construction soldiers in the city to maintain the glorious traditions of revolutionary soldiers and play a greater role on the economic construction front of the motherland.

    Over the past two years, 96.7% of Chengdu's demobilized and construction soldiers have participated in industrial and agricultural production, as well as work in government agencies and enterprises. A portion of demobilized and construction soldiers who were unable to participate in production due to old age, weakness, illness, or injury also received assistance and care from the People's Government. The vast majority of demobilized and construction soldiers who participated in production have become outstanding figures on various production fronts and work posts: more than forty demobilized and construction soldiers have been elected as people's representatives at the city, district, and township levels, ninety-nine have been elected as mutual aid team leaders and cadres of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and many demobilized and construction soldiers have been rated as industrial or agricultural labor models. Some have even honorably joined the Communist Party of China and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

    At the meeting, five representatives of demobilized and construction soldiers introduced their model deeds of actively participating in production and construction. Among them were Deng Weifu, who mobilized farmers to actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, honorably joined the Communist Party of China, and was elected as a township people's representative; Gao Guangxin, a fitter at the private Huaxin Iron Factory, who improved tools and increased work efficiency by five and a half times, saving the country over 120 million yuan, and was elected as a third-class labor model of Chengdu in 1954; and Wu Yukun, Yao Guangming, and Le Tianxing, outstanding figures who worked tirelessly and actively in their respective positions and were deeply loved by the masses. Representatives of the Sichuan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also expressed the Sichuan Military Region's concern and hope for demobilized and construction soldiers at the meeting. The demobilized and construction soldier representatives attending the meeting unanimously thanked the Communist Party and the People's Government for their care for the demobilized and construction soldiers. They expressed their determination to maintain the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers and strive for greater glory in order to repay the Party and the government for their training and care. Some demobilized and construction soldiers also made plans for their future work, guaranteeing that they would play a model role in all tasks.

    The meeting presented prizes to Deng Weifu, Gao Guangxin, Zhang Xirong, Wu Yukun and other nine people who worked actively and became models for the city's demobilized and construction soldiers. In addition, forty-two other demobilized and construction soldiers were commended at the meeting. (Xinhua News Agency)

    会上，有五位复员建设军人代表介绍了他们积极参加生产建设的模范事迹。其中有发动农民积极参加互助合作运动、光荣地加入了中国共产党、并被选为乡人民代表的邓维富；有改进工具提高工作效率五倍半为国家节约财富一亿二千多万元、一九五四年当选为成都市三等劳动模范的私营华新铁工厂钳工高光信；有在自己工作岗位上不辞劳苦、积极工作，深为群众爱戴的伍玉昆、姚光明、乐天星等优秀人物。中国人民解放军四川军区代表也在会上表达了四川军区对复员建设军人的关怀和希望。参加会议的复员建设军人代表一致感谢共产党和人民政府对复员建设军人的关怀，他们纷纷表示要保持革命军人的光荣传统，争取更大光荣，来回答党和政府对自己的培养和关怀。有的复员建设军人还订出了今后工作计划，保证在各项工作中起模范作用。
