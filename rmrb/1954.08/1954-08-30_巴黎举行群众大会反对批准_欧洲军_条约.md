Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 29th: According to TASS, the working people of Paris held a mass rally at the Winter Velodrome on the 27th against the ratification of the "European Army" treaty. The rally was convened by the Presidium of the French National Peace Council. Participants in the presidium included peace activists, leaders of the French General Confederation of Labor, the French Communist Party, former resistance fighters and war victims organizations, as well as representatives from women's and youth organizations.

Speakers at the meeting emphasized that the Paris treaty, which would push France down the path of disaster and war, must be rejected.

Socialist Party member Cotelle said: "Pulling us into the European Defense Community is an attempt to push us onto a path that can only lead to destruction and death. Enough! Now we want to fully restore our national independence, and we do not want the American embassy to decide France's internal affairs!"

The General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, Frachon, spoke about the struggle of the French working class against the "European Army." He said that this struggle should be strengthened during these decisive days when the French National Assembly is about to begin discussing the "European Defense Community" treaty.

Speakers at the rally also included Servais-Feraire, former chairman of the Resistance Parliamentary Group of the French Provisional Assembly, National Assembly members Laurent Casanova, Delaviergerie, and Albert Vigneau, who vehemently condemned the Paris treaty and the rearmament of West Germany, and demanded negotiations and a relaxation of international tensions.

The congress unanimously adopted a resolution stating: The people of France across the country have expressed, and will continue to express, their utter abhorrence of the "European Defense Community," which will fix the rearmament of Germany and become an obstacle to European security and peace. We want to announce to the deputies facing the most serious decisions and the greatest responsibilities: the rearmament of Germany is not inevitable. To save France, to save France's independence and peace, on this tenth anniversary of the liberation of France, please respond to the call of national will: Reject the European Defense Community! Oppose the arming of Germany! Shout loudly, demanding immediate four-power consultations between France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union!

    巴黎举行群众大会反对批准“欧洲军”条约
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：巴黎劳动人民二十七日在冬季赛车场举行反对批准“欧洲军”条约的群众大会。这次大会是由法国全国和平理事会主席团召开的。参加大会主席团的有和平人士、法国总工会、法国共产党、前抵抗运动战士和战争受难者组织的领袖以及妇女和青年组织的代表。
    在会上发言的人着重指出：必须拒绝把法国推往灾难和战争道路上去的巴黎条约。
    社会党党员科特尔说：“把我们拉进欧洲防务集团，就是竭力把我们推上只会导致毁灭和死亡的道路。够了！现在我们希望完全恢复我国的民族独立，我们不愿意叫美国大使馆来决定法国的内务！”
    法国总工会总书记弗拉商谈到法国工人阶级反对“欧洲军”的斗争情况。他说：在法国国民议会就要开始讨论“欧洲防务集团”条约的这些具有决定性的日子里，更应当加强这种斗争。
    在大会上讲话的还有前法国临时议会抵抗运动议会党团主席赛尔弗—费里尔、国民议会议员洛朗·加桑诺瓦、德拉维热里和阿尔培·弗西纳尔，他们猛烈谴责巴黎条约和重新武装西德，并且要求举行谈判和缓和国际紧张局势。
    大会一致通过决议说：法国全国各地人民已经表示了而且今后还要继续表示他们对“欧洲防务集团”的切齿痛恨，这个集团要把德国的重新武装固定下来，而且会成为欧洲安全与和平的障碍。我们要向面临最严重的决定和最重大的责任的议员们宣布：重新武装德国并不是不可避免的。为了拯救法国、拯救法国的独立和和平，在法国解放十周年这个日子里，请响应民族意志的号召：拒绝欧洲防务集团！反对武装德国！大声疾呼，要求立刻进行法、英、美、苏四国协商！
