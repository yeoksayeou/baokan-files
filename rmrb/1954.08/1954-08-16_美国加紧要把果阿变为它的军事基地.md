    The United States Intensifies Efforts to Turn Goa into Its Military Base
    Dong Chang
    As the United States intensifies its conspiracy to invade Southeast Asia, Goa, a Portuguese colony in India, is increasingly becoming a military base threatening India and undermining peace in Asia.
    Goa, historically and geographically connected to India by blood, has suffered under Portuguese rule for over four hundred years. Throughout the period of Portuguese rule, the people of Goa have been engaged in unremitting struggles for national liberation and reunification with India. In recent years, the Indian government and Prime Minister Nehru have repeatedly asserted that Goa must be incorporated into India. On March 17, 1953, Prime Minister Nehru said that any attempt to use foreign territories in India as "bases for foreign military activities" would be an "unfriendly act" and a violation of India's normal policies and interests.
    However, the Portuguese ruling clique has consistently and unreasonably rejected the legitimate demands repeatedly made by the Indian government and Goan patriots to safeguard India's sovereign integrity and peaceful security.
    The American ruling clique has long been deliberately planning steps to turn Goa into its military base. On May 25, 1950, the Republican leader of the US House of Representatives, Martin, demanded that the then US Secretary of State Acheson use all his power to prevent India from recovering Goa. Martin believed that handing over Goa, obtained from Portugal, to India would be a very unfortunate thing. By January 5, 1951, the United States and Portugal signed the US-Portugal "Mutual Assistance and Common Defense Treaty," which in effect transformed Goa and other Portuguese colonies into US military bases. While the people of Portuguese territories in India were strongly demanding reunification with India, the "Washington Post" of August 9 this year actually said that any action to recover Goa was tantamount to "aggression." It goes without saying that this series of activities by the United States is consistent with its conspiracy to turn Goa into a springboard for aggression against Southeast Asia. The Indian "Blitz" weekly once pointed out that the United States is currently trying to include Goa in its planned Southeast Asian aggressive bloc.
    Portugal is stepping up its military expansion in Goa and suppressing the Goan people's reunification movement. According to Indian newspapers, the Portuguese government has allocated huge sums for military expenditures in Goa. The main port of Goa, Marmagoa, has been rebuilt and fortified with American funding and under the supervision of American engineers. A military airfield has been built on the plateau of Bampolim in the port area. The Portuguese authorities in Goa even announced an emergency and mandatory decree on December 24 last year, stipulating that people's property, residences, vehicles could be requisitioned, and any citizen could be conscripted. According to the "Amrita Bazar Patrika," the Portuguese government also transported black troops from Africa and a large amount of military equipment from Mozambique and Angola to Goa. The Press Trust of India reported that 10,000 troops were concentrated in Goa alone. In coordination with the military expansion and war preparations in Goa, the "Goa Radio Station" frequently broadcasts war hysteria and anti-Indian propaganda. Under American control, the products of the two important strategic materials, iron ore and manganese ore, produced in the Goa region are directly shipped to the United States or Japan, which is supported by the United States.
    In order to continue to occupy Goa as a military base, the Portuguese authorities in Goa openly declared that they would use force to suppress the movement to reunify Goa with India. For several months, the Goan government has carried out mass arrests, imposed martial law in important cities, and stepped up the construction of fortifications and obstacles in areas bordering India.
    The United States' conspiracy activities in Goa and Portugal's military expansion and suppression of the reunification movement in Goa have been strongly opposed by the vast majority of the people in the Portuguese territories in India, and the movement for reunification with India is expanding. According to the "Hindustan Times," in the seventy-two villages in the Portuguese-controlled Nagar Haveli region north of Bombay, sixty-three have been liberated from Portuguese rule, and the local autonomous organizations have taken control of the government. The movement to reunify Goa with India is also expanding.
    The Indian people certainly cannot tolerate their compatriots in Goa continuing to be subjected to colonial rule, cannot tolerate the integrity of their territory being undermined, and even more cannot tolerate foreign territories in India becoming foreign military bases that endanger India's security.

    美国加紧要把果阿变为它的军事基地
    东昌
    随着美国侵略东南亚的阴谋计划的加紧进行，葡萄牙在印度的属地——果阿正日益成为威胁印度和破坏亚洲和平的军事基地。
    在历史和地理上与印度有着血肉关系的果阿，四百多年来在葡萄牙的统治下受着苦难。在葡萄牙统治的整个期间，果阿人民进行着为争取民族解放，以及重新归并印度的不懈斗争。近几年来，印度政府和尼赫鲁总理一再提出了果阿必须归并印度的主张。尼赫鲁总理在一九五三年三月十七日说，任何使用外国在印度的属地作为“外国人的军事活动基地”的企图都是一种“不友好的行为”，是违反印度的正常政策和利益的。
    但是，葡萄牙统治集团对印度政府和果阿爱国者多次提出的维护印度主权完整与和平安全的合理主张，一贯采取无理拒绝的态度。
    美国统治集团早就处心积虑地安排了变果阿为它的军事基地的步骤。一九五○年五月二十五日，美国众议院共和党领袖马丁要求当时的美国国务卿艾奇逊使用一切力量阻止印度收回果阿。马丁认为，把从葡萄牙手中取得的果阿交给印度是一件很不幸的事情。到了一九五一年一月五日，美国和葡萄牙签订了美葡“互助与共同防御条约”，这个条约实际上把果阿和葡萄牙的其他属地转变为美国的军事基地。正当葡萄牙在印度的属地人民强烈要求归并印度时，今年八月九日的“华盛顿邮报”竟说，收回果阿的任何行动等于
  “侵略”。不言而喻，美国的这一系列活动是和它想把果阿变为侵略东南亚的跳板的阴谋相一致的。印度“闪电”周报就曾指出，美国目前正想把果阿列入它策划的东南亚侵略集团中去。
    葡萄牙正加紧扩充果阿的军备，并镇压果阿人民的归并运动。据印度报纸报道，葡萄牙政府拨出巨款作为果阿的军事费用。果阿的主要港口麻玛加奥在美国的资助和美国工程师的监督下进行了重建并加强了设防，在港口地区斑波林的高原已建筑了军用飞机场。果阿的葡萄牙当局在去年十二月二十四日更宣布了紧急的、强制的法令，规定可征用人民财产、住宅、车辆和征召任何公民入伍。据“甘露市场报”报道，葡萄牙政府还把非洲的黑人军队和大量军事装备从莫三鼻给和安哥拉运达果阿。印度报业托辣斯的消息说，单在果阿一地就集中了一万军队。配合着果阿的扩军备战活动，“果阿广播电台”经常播送着战争歇斯底里和反印的宣传。在美国的控制下，果阿地区出产的两项重要战略物资铁矿和锰矿的产品，直接运往美国或美国支持下的日本。
    为了继续侵占果阿作为军事基地，果阿葡萄牙当局公开宣布将以武力来镇压争取果阿归并印度的运动。几个月来，果阿政府进行了大逮捕，在重要的城市实行了戒严，并在和印度接界的地方加紧建筑防御工事和设置障碍物。
    美国在果阿的阴谋活动和葡萄牙在果阿进行的扩军备战和镇压归并运动的活动，遭到了广大的葡萄牙在印度的属地人民的强烈反对，归并印度的运动日益扩展。据“印度斯坦时报”消息，在孟买以北的葡属纳加尔哈维利地区的七十二个乡村中，已有六十三个从葡萄牙的统治下解放了出来，并由当地的自治机构掌握政权。争取果阿归并印度的运动也在扩展中。
    印度人民当然不能容忍他们在果阿的同胞继续受着殖民统治，不能容忍他们的领土的完整受到破坏，更不能容忍外国在印度的属地变成外国的军事基地，危害印度的安全。
