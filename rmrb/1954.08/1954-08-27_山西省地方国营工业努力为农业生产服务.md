Shanxi Province Local State-Owned Industries Strive to Serve Agricultural Production
Jia Chongzhi, Director of the Industry Department of Shanxi Provincial People's Government

In recent years, the scale of local state-owned industries in Shanxi Province supporting agriculture in implementing socialist transformation has gradually expanded. The variety and output value of local industrial products have been increasing year by year. For example, the product variety in 1953 was 2.25 times that of 1950, and the output value was 2.94 times. A total of more than 278,000 pieces of various large and small agricultural implements were produced, including more than 73,000 various waterwheels, more than 29,000 various walking plows, more than 2,000 sprayers, more than 3,000 corn threshers, more than 18,000 plowshares, more than 100,100 iron shovels, and more than 50,000 other agricultural implements; more than 3,200 cotton gins, 49 fifteen to twenty-five horsepower gas generators, and more than 156,000 sets of axle bearings for horse-drawn carts. In addition, a considerable amount of copper sulfate, chalcopyrite and other pesticides and fertilizers were produced, and more than 25,000 tons of fresh eggs, more than 27,000 tons of cotton, and more than 66,000 tons of oilseeds were processed. In order to improve product quality, employees in some factories put forward the slogan of "No production if the trial production is not good, no factory exit if the quality is not good," making the products meet the requirements of agricultural production. Therefore, it has played a certain role in improving agricultural production and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. Farmers using walking plows for cultivation can generally increase production by 10%; in the Jinan area, crops using phosphate fertilizer can increase production by 10% per mu; the use of pesticides to treat black穗 disease can eliminate 90%. The double-铧 plow, which was only used this year, is also recognized by farmers as being two and a half times more efficient than the old plow, and the soil it turns over is flatter and the plowing is deeper (about 7 inches). Many farmers, after using these new agricultural implements, gratefully said: "The worker elder brothers are working hard and thinking of ways to manufacture new agricultural implements for us. We should also step up production, produce more grain, and support national construction."

In the past few years, local state-owned industries in Shanxi Province have also taken some detours. For example, in the second half of 1952 and the first half of 1953, due to the lack of good integration of supply, production, and sales in agricultural implement manufacturing factories, products were overstocked and capital turnover was sluggish. Many enterprise cadres did not carefully analyze the reasons for this situation, did not see the essence of the problem, and mistakenly believed that agricultural implement production was "too much" and "farmers' purchasing power was low." As a result, a passive waiting mentality arose, leading to a relatively long period of production contraction and a decline in production. In the second half of last year, in order to clarify these erroneous ideas, develop local industry, and actively support agricultural production, the Industry Department of the Provincial People's Government organized working groups to conduct in-depth investigations and research on agricultural implement issues in seventeen villages in four counties. The results showed that, due to the large-scale development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, production had greatly improved, and the political and cultural levels of the members had also improved, and production planning had also been strengthened compared to the past. After the implementation of the unified purchase of grain, the purchasing power of the countryside was even greater and was growing. Suitable, high-quality, and inexpensive new agricultural implements were not only not too many, but were too few in some areas. For example, the members of the production cooperative in Xiaosi Village (麻 producing area), Changzhi County, had an average surplus of more than seven *shi* of grain per household after all expenses. In the past few years, this village alone has purchased 20 waterwheels and 8 walking plows. In 1950, Wuma Village, Changzhi County, purchased eight toothed-wheel waterwheels at one time. In the second half of 1952, Beizhang, Xiaonie, Zhaoxian, and Beisu villages in Xinjiang County increased their purchase of 36 carts. This shows that the purchasing power of the countryside is increasing day by day, and the farmers' demand for new agricultural implements is urgent. We used these practical examples to criticize the erroneous argument that "the purchasing power of the countryside is low," and specifically analyzed the reasons for the decline in production and the overstocking of products.

These reasons are first that the factories did not adequately recognize the complexity and diversity of agricultural requirements. They did not manufacture production materials suitable for farmers' needs based on the actual conditions of geographical environment, climate, and crop types, but only demanded simplification subjectively, starting from the convenience of operation and management. Second, they did not understand the situation, were greedy for greatness and impetuous, and coupled with poor promotion, resulting in a large backlog. Third, some cadres and workers looked down on the production of agricultural implements, thinking that agricultural implements were easy to make and not precise. Therefore, inspections were not strict, and individual parts were crudely manufactured, resulting in poor quality. Fourth, technical guidance was weak. There was no detailed explanation to the farmers about the use techniques and maintenance methods, no specific solutions to repair problems, and the supply organization had too many levels and complicated procedures. Some enterprises had capitalist management ideas, which led to unreasonably high product prices, arousing public dissatisfaction and causing many unnecessary difficulties in the promotion of new agricultural implements.

At the end of last year, based on the new situation in the countryside and the instructions of the Local Industry Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee, we put forward new requirements to the relevant enterprises, so that cadres and employees realized that local state-owned industries can only improve their own work and adapt to the specific requirements of agricultural production in order to achieve the goal of supporting agriculture in implementing socialist transformation. At the same time, after studying the Party's general line during the transition period, enterprise cadres and employees became more clear about their tasks. In the past six months, the Linfen and Yuncheng Machinery Factories have made preliminary achievements in producing new agricultural implements suitable for agricultural needs. At present, in addition to continuing to manufacture various small new agricultural implements and animal-drawn agricultural implements, we also use the power equipment of the cotton ginning factories to run two seasonal gas generator watering stations in Sanjiadian, Xinjiang County, and Shicun, Hejin County, during the off-season in summer and autumn. After gaining experience, we will mobilize other cotton ginning factories to promote them universally next year. Modern water pumps for agricultural production cooperatives are also being trial-produced. And preparations have begun to build a phosphate fertilizer manufacturing plant.

From the exploration of the past few years, we feel that in order to enable local state-owned industries to better serve local agricultural production, we must determine the product varieties and specifications to be manufactured according to the specific requirements of farmers. When we produced waterwheels in 1952, we did not produce various products of different specifications according to the depth of the wells and the size of the livestock in various places, but only made one type, which resulted in an overstocking of more than 10,000 units. This year, the Linfen and Yuncheng Machinery Factories have formally manufactured five-row seeders, deep-well waterwheels, three-toothed weeding hoes, seedling transplanters, etc. according to the needs of farmers, which are very popular among farmers. Before determining these products, the two factories dispatched cadres to rural areas to investigate and visit, understand the characteristics of various places, and understand and synthesize the various requirements of farmers. For example, organized farmers, due to their good economic conditions, collective labor, and large contiguous land, require the supply of larger agricultural implements in order to save labor and expand reproduction; while individual farmers, due to insufficient economic strength, only need some small agricultural implements. In the process of trial-producing products, they also invited agricultural labor models to visit and participate in the technical appraisal of the products, fully listened to the opinions of the farmers, and made the products truly meet the needs of the farmers. As the farmers reflected: "Worker elder brothers only make but don't use, we only use but don't make. If we don't contact each other, the agricultural implements we make will not be easy to use. Only by contacting each other more can we overcome the defects that are not easy to use."

After the products are manufactured, we must cooperate with the agricultural departments to do a good job in technical instruction, so that the usage methods of the new products are mastered by the majority of farmers. When promoting the new-style walking plow, the farmers in Xiaonie Village, Fifth District, Xinjiang County, reflected that "the new walking plow is good, but it can't be used." However, due to the timely organization of technical training and technical instruction by the District Party Committee, helping farmers to master the technology, the District Cooperative sold 35 walking plows in a few days. This year, the Linfen and Yuncheng Machinery Factories also compiled and printed detailed and easy-to-understand manuals for various new products, indicating the performance, usage methods, and storage methods of various agricultural implements. At the same time, they also sent people to conduct on-site demonstrations, and invited agricultural labor models, production cooperative cadres, and activists from various places to visit, and taught them the usage methods, making them the backbone for promoting the use of new agricultural implements, so that the new agricultural implements purchased by the farmers can be used immediately.

Strengthening the inspection and repair of new agricultural implements and the allocation of parts is also very important. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this work, which greatly affected the promotion of new agricultural implements. For example, of the ten corn threshers bought by farmers in Beitianhe, Changzhi, three could not be used just because they lost screws. According to preliminary estimates, for sprayers alone, due to the inability to match parts such as leather pads, protective mouth screws, and water outlets, about 20,000 to 30,000 sprayers are currently idle and unused in rural Shanxi. Farmers generally reflect: "New agricultural implements are good, but they can't be repaired when they are broken, parts can't be matched when they are missing, and they can't be protected normally." In order to solve this problem, in January of this year, the Changzhi Municipal Industry Bureau and the Changzhi Prefectural Agricultural Section jointly selected 106 people from small handicraft producers such as blacksmiths and carpenters in rural areas to run a short-term training class for repairing and配ing new agricultural implements. The results were good, and the farmers found it convenient. The cotton ginning factory in Xinjiang County used the off-season to organize the workers who repair equipment into a small agricultural implement repair and 配 station, which has received many good results. However, this work is not carried out much at present, and it must be continued to be strengthened in the future to gradually solve the difficulties encountered by farmers in this regard.

In terms of operation, local state-owned factories must be closely linked with grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives, and sign supply and marketing contracts as much as possible to ensure mutual supply. Because some of the raw materials needed by local state-owned industries are supplied by agricultural production cooperatives or supply and marketing cooperatives, while agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives need to obtain products from local state-owned industries, this connection should be consolidated as a system. Local state-owned factories should also have appropriate division of labor with handicraft production cooperatives. Taking agricultural implement manufacturing as an example, more complex and large-scale agricultural implements are manufactured by local state-owned factories, while simple and small agricultural implements and the repair of some new agricultural implements are undertaken by cooperatives, and local state-owned factories provide technical assistance to give play to the positive role of handicraft production cooperatives.

Continuously improving product quality and reducing product costs and selling prices is an important responsibility of local state-owned industries. This can not only expand the role of supporting agricultural production, but also open up broad avenues for the development of local state-owned industries themselves.

In the future, with the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, local state-owned industries must gradually improve production and management. First of all, we must correct the erroneous ideas of some cadres who believe that the manufacturing of production materials for agriculture, especially agricultural implements, requires low technology and is not as glorious as manufacturing complex machinery, and that supporting agriculture and handicraft work is too fragmented and sales are scattered, which is not as good as single products. We should encourage factories to manufacture various agricultural implements that are suitable for local conditions, of high quality, and low prices. Local state-owned factories must also gradually improve their manufacturing technology level in order to adapt to the new requirements of the countryside. For example, Liberation-style agricultural implements can no longer fully meet the needs of agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, this year we are preparing to produce 30 sets of animal-drawn agricultural implements to meet the requirements of the agricultural sector to establish ten animal-drawn agricultural implement stations. The emergence of animal-drawn agricultural implements will inevitably lead to changes in the ownership of agricultural implements and put forward more urgent requirements for large agricultural implements, and new problems will also arise in the manufacturing and technical instruction of large agricultural implements. We must always pay attention to this development trend and problems, and timely and proactively meet the various new requirements of agricultural production. Of course, full attention must also be paid to and meet the requirements of mutual aid groups and individual farmers.

    山西省地方国营工业努力为农业生产服务
    山西省人民政府工业厅厅长  贾冲之
    几年来，山西省地方国营工业支援农业实行社会主义改造的规模是逐渐扩大的。地方工业的产品品种和产值都在逐年增长。例如，一九五三年的产品品种为一九五○年的二点二五倍，产值为二点九四倍。共生产各种大小农具二十七万八千多件，其中各式水车七万三千多部，各式步犁二万九千多部，喷雾器二千多部，玉米脱粒机三千多部，犁铧一万八千多个，铁锹十万零一千多张，其他农具五万多张。轧花机三千二百多部，十五到二十五匹马力煤气机四十九部，马车轴承十五万六千多盘。此外，还生产了不少硫酸铜、王铜及其他农药肥料，加工了鲜蛋二万五千多吨，皮棉二万七千多吨，油籽六万六千多吨。为了提高产品质量，有的工厂的职工提出了“试制不好不生产，质量不好不出厂”的行动口号，使产品合乎农业生产的要求，因而对提高农业生产和加强工农联盟都起了一定的作用。农民使用步犁耕种，一般可增产百分之十，晋南地区使用磷肥的农作物每亩可增产百分之十；使用农药治黑穗病，可以消灭百分之九十。今年才使用的双铧犁，农民也公认比旧犁提高效率二倍半，而且翻的土平，犁的也深（约七寸多）。很多农民用了这些新农具后，都很感激地说：“工人老大哥辛辛苦苦动脑筋，想办法，为咱们制造新农具，咱们也应该加紧生产，多打粮食，支援国家建设”。
    几年来，山西省的地方国营工业也走了一些弯路。例如农具制造工厂在一九五二年下半年和一九五三年上半年，由于供产销没有很好结合，产品积压，资金周转不灵，很多企业干部没有认真分析产生这种情况的原因，没有看到问题的本质，就错误地认为农具生产“太多了”，“农民购买力低”，于是产生了消极等待思想，形成较长时期的生产退缩，使生产下降了。去年下半年，为了澄清这些错误思想，发展地方工业，积极支援农业生产，省人民政府工业厅组织工作组，就农具问题在四个县十七个村子作深入的调查研究，结果证明：由于农村的互助合作运动大量发展，生产有很大提高，社员的政治思想水平、文化水平也已提高，生产的计划性也较前加强。实行粮食统购以后，农村的购买力是更巨大了，并在日益增长着。适用的质好价廉的新式农具不但不是太多，而且在有些地区是太少了。如长治县小寺村（产麻区）生产合作社社员每户除一切开销外，平均还有七石余粮。几年来，这个村仅买进的水车就有二○部，步犁就有八部。长治县五马村一九五○年一次就买进牙轮式水车八部。新绛县北张、小聂、赵仙、北苏四个村在一九五二年下半年即增购大车三十六辆。这说明了农村购买力是在日益增高，农民对新式农具的要求是迫切的。我们就以这些实际例子批判了那些认为“农村购买力低”的错误论调，并具体分析了造成生产下降，产品积压的原因。
    这些原因首先是各厂对农业要求的复杂性，多种多样性认识不足，没有从地理环境、气候、作物种类等实际情况出发制造适合于农民需要的生产资料，而只是从便于经营管理出发，主观地要求单一化。其次是不了解情况，贪大冒进，加上推广不力，造成大量积压。第三是部分干部、工人轻视农具生产，认为农具好做，不精密，因而检验不严，个别部件粗制滥造，质量不高。第四是技术指导薄弱，没有详细向农民讲解使用技术和养护修理方法，没有具体解决修理问题，再加上供应组织层次多，手续繁，有些企业存在资本主义的经营思想，以致不合理地提高产品价格，引起群众不满，使新农具的推销遇到许多不应有的困难。
    去年底，我们根据农村的新情况及华北行政委员会地方工业局的指示，向有关企业提出了新的要求，使干部和职工认识到地方国营工业只有改进本身的工作，适应农业生产的具体要求进行生产，才能达到支援农业实行社会主义改造的目的。同时，企业干部和职工学习了党在过渡时期的总路线以后，更加明确了自己的任务。半年来，临汾、运城机械厂在生产适合农业需要的新农具方面，取得了初步的成绩。目前我们除继续制造各种小型新农具和马拉农具外，还利用轧花厂的动力设备，于停产的夏、秋季在新绛县三家店和河津县史村试办两个季节性的煤气机浇水站，待取得经验后，明年将动员其他轧花厂普遍推广。供应农业生产合作社用的现代化抽水机也正在试制中。并开始筹建一座磷肥制造厂。
    从过去几年的摸索中，我们觉得，要使地方国营工业更好的为当地农业生产服务，必须根据农民的具体要求，确定制造的产品品种和规格。一九五二年我们生产水车时，没有根据各地水井的深浅和牲畜大小来生产各种不同规格的产品，而只做了一种，结果就积压了一万多部。而今年临汾、运城两个机械厂根据农民需要正式制造的五行播种机，深井水车，三齿耘锄，移苗器等都很受农民欢迎。这两个厂在确定这些产品前，都抽调干部到农村调查访问，了解各地特点，了解和综合农民的各种要求。如组织起来的农民由于经济条件好，集体劳动以及土地大块衔接等条件，就要求供应较大型的农具，以节省劳动力扩大再生产；而个体农民由于经济力量不足，只需一些小型农具。在试制产品过程中，他们又邀请农业劳动模范来参观，并参加对产品的技术鉴定，充分听取农民的意见，使产品真正切合农民的需要。正如农民反映的：“工人老大哥光做不用，我们光用不做，如果互相不联系，造出的农具就会不好用。只有多联系，才能克服不好用的毛病。”
    产品制造出来以后，必须配合农业部门做好技术传授工作，使新的产品的使用方法为广大农民所掌握。在推广新式步犁时，新绛县五区小聂村农民反映说：“新步犁好是好，就是使不了。”但由于中共区委会及时组织了技术训练和技术传授，帮助农民掌握技术，区合作社在几天时间内就卖出步犁三十五部。临汾，运城两个机械厂今年还给各种新产品编印详细通俗的说明书，注明各种农具的性能，使用方法和保管方法，同时还派人进行实地表演，请各地农业劳动模范，生产合作社干部和积极分子参观，向他们传授使用方法，使他们成为推广使用新农具的骨干，使农民购买的新农具都能即时运用起来。
    加强对新农具的检修和零件配制也十分重要。过去我们对这个工作注意不够，使新农具的推广受到很大影响。如长治北天河农民买的十部玉米脱粒机，有三部只因掉了螺丝就不能用了。据初步估计，仅喷雾器一项，由于皮垫、护口螺丝，出水嘴子等零件配不起来，目前在山西农村闲搁起来不用的喷雾器约有二、三万部。农民普遍反映：“新农具好是好，就是坏了不会修，缺了零件不能配，平常不会保护”。为了解决这一问题，今年一月份长治市工业局与长治专署农业科共同从农村的铁工、木工等小手工业生产者中抽调了一○六人，试办了一个修配新式农具短期训练班，结果成绩良好，农民称便。新绛县轧花厂利用停产的季节，将修理设备的工人组织成一个小型农具修配站，已收到不少效果。但目前这一工作还进行得不多，今后必须继续加强，以逐步解决农民在这方面所遇到的困难。
    在经营方面，地方国营工厂和基层供销合作社、农业生产合作社必须紧密联系，并尽可能签订供销合同，互相保证供应。因为地方国营工业需要的若干原料，是依靠农业生产合作社或供销合作社供应的，而农业生产合作社和供销合作社则需要从地方国营工业取得产品，因此，应该把这种联系作为制度巩固下来。地方国营工厂与手工业生产合作社也应有适当分工。以农具制造来说，较复杂的大型农具由地方国营工厂承制，简易的小型农具和一些新农具的修理工作由合作社担任起来，地方国营工厂给以技术的帮助，以发挥手工业生产合作社的积极作用。
    不断提高产品质量，降低产品成本和售价，是地方国营工业的重要责任。这不仅可以扩大支援农业生产的作用，而且也为地方国营工业本身的发展开辟了广阔的道路。
    今后，随着农村互助合作运动的发展，地方国营工业必须逐步改进生产经营管理。首先，必须纠正部分干部认为农业用的生产资料，尤其是农具的制造需要技术低，不如制造复杂机械光荣，以及嫌支援农业、手工业工作太零碎，销路分散，不如单一产品好的错误思想，鼓励各厂制造适合当地条件的、质量高、价格低的各式农具。地方国营工厂也必须逐步提高制造技术水平，才能适应农村的新要求。如解放式农具现在已不能完全适应农业生产合作社的需要了，因此，今年我们就准备生产三十套马拉农具，以满足农业部门建立十个马拉农具站的要求。而马拉农具的出现，必然会引起农具所有制的变化，对大农具提出更迫切的要求，而大型农具的制造和技术传授也会发生新问题。我们必须时刻注意这种发展的趋势和问题，及时地主动地满足农业生产的各种新的要求。当然，对于互助组和个体农民的要求也必须充分予以注意和满足。
