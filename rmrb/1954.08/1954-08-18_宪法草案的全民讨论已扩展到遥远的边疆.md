The nationwide discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has extended to the most remote border areas of the motherland. The footprints of reporters and propagandists have been left in many of the most remote small towns and extremely isolated villages. People of all ethnic groups in the border areas, using various national languages, are talking about the Draft Constitution, about their happiness and the warmth of the big family of the motherland.

In the Heihe Special District, the northernmost part of our country, activities to promote the Draft Constitution are being widely carried out in counties along the Heilongjiang River. Slogans and posters are plastered all over Heihe city, and the People's Cultural Center broadcasts propaganda programs about the Draft Constitution to the city's residents every day using loudspeakers. Many propagandists go deep into agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to conduct propaganda among farmers in conjunction with production. In Sunwu County, Foshan County, and Huma County, the northernmost part of Heihe Special District, propaganda and discussion activities have also been widely launched. In order to publicize the Draft Constitution to the Oroqen people living in the Xing'an Mountains, the Heihe Special District Draft Constitution Discussion Committee specifically organized Oroqen and Han cadres to go to the places where the Oroqen people live to carry out propaganda about the Draft Constitution.

Reporters, propagandists, ethnic affairs cadres, and representatives of all ethnic groups active on the Yunnan border are using large and small mass meetings, report meetings, or national forms such as mountain song duets and flower lantern tunes to carry out propaganda among the masses. Yunnan People's Broadcasting Station has also specially organized broadcasts in four ethnic languages, Dai, Lisu, Hani, and Kawa, to explain the content of the Draft Constitution to the people of all ethnic groups. Radio operators in Gengma, Shuangjiang, Cangyuan, Lancang, Yuanyang and other places also took radios to the countryside to organize listening. The people of all ethnic groups deeply feel the warmth of the big family of the nation. Many cadres said: After discussing the Draft Constitution, their enthusiasm for work has become even greater. Militiamen of all ethnic groups also expressed their determination to better fulfill their obligations and guard the borders of the motherland.

In the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region on the banks of the Jinsha River, and the 28 counties of the Muli Tibetan Autonomous Region on the Kangzang Plateau, discussions on the Draft Constitution have been gradually launched. In the eastern Han areas and areas where various ethnic groups live together, the propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution has penetrated into the countryside. In this area with a population of approximately 1.8 million, there are more than 400 reporters, more than 7,000 propagandists, and more than 2,000 representatives of the people's congresses of various counties, staff members of local cultural centers and radio stations, forming a huge propaganda force, closely integrated with agricultural production, mutual aid and cooperation, and other central tasks to carry out propaganda activities. After discussing the Draft Constitution, the people's representatives of various counties in the Xichang Special District decided to establish more than 400 agricultural production cooperatives in the land reform areas throughout the district this autumn and next spring.

In Guizhou Province, the propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution has penetrated into the vast mountainous areas. Many areas have organized folk artists to use storytelling, clapper talk, singing and other forms to publicize to the masses. "Local broadcasts" and singing mountain songs are widely used in rural areas for publicity. Wang Chaosheng, a self-employed farmer from Changchang Township, Sandu County, after listening to the propaganda of the Draft Constitution, understood that farmers must take the road of mutual aid and cooperation in order to live a collectively prosperous life, and automatically invited six self-employed households to form a mutual aid team. After the discussion of the Draft Constitution in Gemei Township, Ziyun County, not only were the original three mutual aid teams that were about to break up consolidated, but also eight new mutual aid teams were developed and a credit cooperative was organized.

Xinhua News Agency: The fishermen along the coast of Guangdong Province greeted the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China with excitement. Zhang Qiyuan, vice chairman of the Fishermen's Union in Zhapo Town, Yangjiang County, said: Before liberation, the fishermen and fishermen in Zhapo Town were subjected to layers of oppression and exploitation by reactionary governments and local bullies. Although they fought the wind and waves all year round, they still lived in hunger and cold. After liberation, more than 7,000 fishermen and fishermen in Zhapo Town truly turned over. In the past five years, the state has used more than 9.8 billion yuan in huge fishery production loans to support the restoration and development of fishery, which has given the fishing port a new look. Lin Yuanji, a member of the Fishermen's Association, and his family have worked hard at sea for three generations, and in the end, they only have a deep-sea fishing boat that is getting more and more dilapidated. This spring, the first and second fishery production cooperatives were established, and Lin Yuanji joined the cooperative. During the spring and autumn sea operations, they increased production by more than 30% compared with ordinary self-employed fishing boats, their lives have been improved, and everyone has the ability to expand production. Lin Yuanji said with emotion: The socialist direction stipulated in the Draft Constitution is good, and it is good to take the road of cooperation! Huang Liping, vice chairman of the Fishermen's Association and a female fishery worker, said: In the old society, fishing women were more oppressed and discriminated against than women on land. They were beaten and scolded by their husbands at home and insulted on land. After liberation, the situation was different. Most of the neighborhood residents committees in the town are fishing women. She said that in the future, she will mobilize fishery workers and fishermen women to better participate in labor production and social activities, so that women can play a greater role in national construction.

    宪法草案的全民讨论已扩展到遥远的边疆
    中华人民共和国宪法草案的全民讨论，已扩展到祖国最遥远的边疆地带。许多最边远的小城镇和极偏僻的乡村，都留下了报告员和宣传员的足迹。边疆各族人民，用各种民族不同的语言，谈论着宪法草案，谈论着他们的幸福和祖国大家庭的温暖。
    在我国最北部的黑河专区，宣传宪法草案的活动正在黑龙江沿岸各县广泛展开。黑河城区到处张贴着标语、口号，人民文化馆每日利用扩音喇叭向城区居民播送有关宪法草案的宣传节目。许多宣传人员深入到农业生产合作社和互助组中，结合生产向农民进行宣传。在孙吴县、佛山县以及黑河专区最北部的呼玛县，宣传讨论活动也已广泛展开。为了向居住在兴安岭的鄂伦春族人民宣传宪法草案，黑河专区宪法草案讨论委员会专门组织了鄂伦春族和汉族干部，派往鄂伦春族人民聚居的地方去开展宪法草案的宣传。
    活跃在云南边疆的报告员、宣传员、民族工作干部和各族人民代表们，分别利用大、小型群众会，报告会，或者山歌对唱、花灯小调等民族形式，在群众中展开宣传活动。云南人民广播电台还专门组织了傣、傈僳、哈尼、佧瓦等四种民族语言的广播，向各族人民讲解宪法草案的内容。耿马、双江、沧源、澜沧、元阳等地的收音员，还带着收音机，到乡村去组织收听。各族人民深切体会到民族大家庭的温暖。许多干部都说：讨论了宪法草案以后，工作的劲头更大了。各族民兵们也表示自己的决心，要更好地尽自己的义务，守好祖国的边疆。
    在康藏高原上的西康省藏族自治区、金沙江岸的凉山彝族自治区和木里藏族自治区的二十八个县中，都已逐步展开了宪法草案的讨论。在东部汉族地区和各民族杂居区宪法草案的宣传讨论已深入农村。在这约一百八十万人口的地区内，有四百多名报告员、七千多名宣传员，配合了二千多名各县人民代表大会代表、各地文化馆、收音站的工作人员，组成了一支巨大的宣传力量，密切结合农业生产、互助合作等中心工作展开了宣传活动。西昌专区各县人民代表在讨论宪法草案后，决定今秋明春全区在土地改革地区，建立四百多个农业生产合作社。
    在贵州省，宪法草案的宣传讨论已深入到广大山区。许多地区组织了民间艺人用说书、快板、演唱等形式来向群众宣传。在农村中广泛利用“土广播”、唱山歌等形式进行宣传。三都县场长乡单干农民王朝生，听了宪法草案的宣传后，懂得农民一定要走互助合作的道路才能过集体富裕生活的道理，自动邀集了六户单干户组成了一个互助组。紫云县革么乡经过宪法草案的讨论后，不仅原来三个要散伙的互助组得到巩固，还新发展了八个互助组，组织了一个信用合作组。
    广东省沿海的渔民们以兴奋的心情迎接了中华人民共和国宪法草案。阳江县闸坡镇渔业工会副主席张启源说：解放前，闸坡镇的渔业工人和渔民受到反动政府和恶霸等层层压迫和剥削，虽然终年和风浪搏斗，但得到的仍是饥寒交迫的生活。解放后，闸坡镇七千多渔业工人和渔民真正翻了身。五年来国家用九十八亿多元巨额的渔业生产贷款扶助渔业的恢复和发展，使这个渔港的面貌焕然一新。渔民协会委员林远基一家三代在海上艰辛劳动，到头只剩有一只越来越破的深海渔船。今年春天，第一、第二渔业生产合作社成立了，林远基参加了合作社，他们在大小春海作业期间，比一般单干渔船增产了百分之三十多，生活得到了改善，大家也有能力扩大生产了。林远基感动地说：宪法草案上规定的社会主义方向好，走合作化的道路好！渔民协会副主席、女渔业工人黄丽萍说：渔家妇女在旧社会里比陆上妇女还要受压迫、受歧视，在家受丈夫打骂，上陆受人侮辱。解放后，情形不同了，镇的街坊居民委员会中大部分都是渔家妇女。她表示今后要发动渔业工人和渔民妇女更好地参加劳动生产和社会活动，使妇女在国家各项建设中发挥更大的作用。　（新华社）
