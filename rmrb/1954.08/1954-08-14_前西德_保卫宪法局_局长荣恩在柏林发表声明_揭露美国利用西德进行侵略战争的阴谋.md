Former West German "Office for the Protection of the Constitution" Director Dr. John issued a statement at a press conference organized in Berlin on August 11th by the Committee for the Struggle for German Unity. Many German and foreign journalists attended the conference.

After Dr. Wilhelm Girnus made a brief speech on behalf of the committee, Dr. John said:

Gentlemen:

Dr. Adenauer broadcast a statement on August 6th regarding the "John Affair," directly linking the "John Affair" with the "European Defense Community" issue. In principle, this cannot be considered wrong, because it is Bonn's "European Defense Community" policy and the consequences of this policy that forced me to do this. Dr. Adenauer declared that the most important thing I have said so far is that I know about the secret additional agreements to the treaty of this community. This statement surprised me very much, because I have not yet said a word about the secret additional agreements to the "European Defense Community" treaty. However, I can guess why Dr. Adenauer repeatedly denies the existence of these secret additional agreements to the treaty. I will talk about this later.

First of all, I would like to state that it was I myself who wished and requested to hold this press conference, because speaking to world public opinion is a very important matter for me.

I must first point out that I have no intention today of arguing with those who have been secretly slandering me up until now and who are publicly slandering me today. This matter will be dealt with later. No matter what slanders people fabricate against me, my decisions and actions are entirely determined by my beliefs, and these beliefs are based on my experience and knowledge. I am still as free in spirit and as non-partisan in politics as I was in the past.

Everyone who has not become completely numb under the impact of the frenetic beat of life in our time will know, or at least sense, that we have an inner voice, which we are often unwilling to listen to, but which will inevitably make itself heard to us. I first heard this inner voice at the beginning of the 1930s, when the Minister of the Interior of Thuringia, Frick, ordered schools to hold prayers in which Hitler's name replaced Christ's name. It was this inner voice that guided me in the struggle against the National Socialist Party, and it is this voice that has brought me here.

This is not the first time I have been accused of being a traitor. It is a strange, perhaps not accidental, fact that those who are now ranting and raving are the very people who accused me of treason ten years ago and who wanted to hang me then. Those who know me or at least have a roughly correct idea of me know that I am not a Communist.

The nonsense that is now being fabricated and circulated, claiming that I have a long-term cooperative relationship with the East, is completely absurd, and I think it is beneath my dignity to pay attention to these slanders.

I have come here out of concern for the future of the German people, and also because I do not have the opportunity to express my views in the West, at least in the Federal Republic. In the Federal Republic, the forces that once brought the National Socialist Party to power have been revived to such an extent that it has become fundamentally impossible for me to do so.

After long consideration, I decided to come to the German Democratic Republic and stay here, because I see that only here is there the greatest possible opportunity to work for the reunification of Germany and against the threat of a new war. In West Germany, even many intelligent and honest people do not see the danger that threatens us, because they are blinded by the propaganda of the Federal Government. Did not many people in Germany say, since 1945, that they had not been able to see the threat of National Socialism before 1933? Therefore, I feel it is my duty to warn the German people publicly and seriously about the danger that threatens us today.

When the first cannon shot is fired, it will be too late.

When I took up my leadership position in my organization in the Federal Republic in December 1950, I fantasized that I could engage in the work of building a new Germany, a Germany that, once National Socialism had been eradicated, could give all Germans the opportunity to live a peaceful life. On the contrary, what we see today is a divided Germany, which, due to the division between East and West, is in danger of becoming a new battlefield, which will not only bring us enormous disaster, but, more importantly, will destroy the fundamental basis of our existence as a nation.

Communism, whether we like it or not, is a reality, and it unites nearly half of the people living on this planet.

The dream of "eliminating Communism again" is as arrogant as Hitler's intention to eliminate Christianity. The clever British have correctly understood this, and therefore they are trying to reach temporary agreements with the Communists who occupy half the world. However, the Americans are not yet willing to recognize this, and they believe that they will sooner or later be able to use a new crusade against the East to eliminate Communism, and they are currently preparing for war.

Due to the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, the Federal Republic has become a tool of American policy in Europe.

America needs German soldiers to engage in a war against the East. They are particularly interested in certain people who have forgotten the lessons of the 1945 disaster and have been waiting to "avenge the defeat of 1945." That is why downright Nazis and militarists are "re-tried in court" in the Federal Republic. For example, there is a certain minister in the Federal Government, Mr. Oberlander, who implemented a "Hitler-style Germanization policy" in Poland, adopting barbaric measures that made honest Germans lose face in front of the whole world.

The First State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, Lex, was shocked by the fact that such a well-known Nazi as Oberlander occupied a seat in the government. He recently said to me in an informal conversation, "We have gone too far again in dealing with the Nazis."

But who in the Federal Republic dares to say this publicly? It is also natural that Oberlander dismissed his predecessor's assistant, who was known as a true democrat, and replaced them with Nazis from Hitler's Eastern Occupied Territories Department.

Everywhere: in administrative agencies, in economic departments, industrial departments, and universities, no matter where you look, the Nazis have once again consolidated their position and revived the spirit that once caused the German people to suffer total collapse. Due to the amnesty, there is now even an opportunity for those Nazis who escaped due punishment in 1945 to be reinstated. A man named Dr. Leweken, who was a former Nazi Party member, exposed his Nazi nature in one of his books praising Hitler's 1923 coup, "Blood Witnesses," "Sentinels on Eternal Duty," and now he has become the chairman of the "European League"—an organization in the Federal Republic that promotes understanding between Germans and French. This is completely ridiculous. He is the one who, during the Third Reich, propagated and promoted something that brought so much suffering to the French people, and now he is doing the work of "promoting" understanding between Germans and French. Isn't this an irony? Dr. Leweken did not hesitate to invite the French fascist Maurice Bardèche to Hamburg last year to meet publicly with members of the "European League."

You can also see from this what Bonn's Franco-German mutual understanding actually is.

I also know very clearly that Mr. Naumann and Mr. Achenbach (and now also Ambassador Abetz, who has been released from a French prison) are working hard to implement their re-Nazification plan. They resolutely place more and more of their kind in important positions.

When the British arrested Naumann last January, the Federal Government attempted to use various methods to mitigate the dangers posed by the reviving National Socialism. The Naumann case has not been tried to this day, because the Federal Government is not interested in seriously eliminating National Socialism, because those incorrigible Nazis are once again being used to launch a crusade against the East.

Nazis have even infiltrated the Free Democratic Party—I feel that I have close ties with the true liberal forces of this party.

It has long been an open secret that the Nazis control the Free Democratic Party in North Rhine-Westphalia. The fact that Mr. Arnold had to accommodate representatives of the Free Democratic Party in the North Rhine-Westphalia state government shows how much pressure the Nazis have exerted again. Their slogan today is: "Regain power by legal means!"

Wherever the Nazis have gained a foothold, they have opened the door for militarists. Former Marshal Manstein was just released from Werl prison when Dr. Adenauer held a formal reception for him in a grand manner. Those generals who once joined Hitler in causing our people to suffer complete destruction have not only long been released, but have also received enviable subsidies.

If these people had learned from their painful experiences and participated in the peaceful construction of a new Germany, no one would say that they should not receive appropriate living expenses from taxpayers' contributions. However, when former generals, such as Mr. Ramcke, who receives a higher subsidy than an actual responsible minister, constantly denigrate democracy and attack France in public speeches and in newspapers in a mocking tone, this makes people have to rise up against it. I have also repeatedly asked the responsible authorities to pay attention to this fact. However, they have never taken any steps.

Let me give another example. Mr. Kesselring, who appears today in courts and in public as an "expert" to defend those officers who fanatically implemented Hitler's "fight to the end" policy, once issued orders to slaughter innocent people who opposed their crazy orders. Former General Manteuffel, who was elected as a Free Democratic Party member of the Federal Parliament, is, according to his closest friends, a thorough Nazi... Former General Tretner, who has always been manipulating behind the scenes of the "Military Association," is one of those officers who have never concealed that, in terms of belief, they are still as fanatical followers of their "Führer" as they were in the past...

John then said that the fact that incorrigible Nazis constantly infiltrate important positions in the Federal Republic is a consequence of Adenauer's policy, which mainly relies on those groups who, together with Hitler, attempted to "eliminate Bolshevism."

This infiltration has not taken the form of organizing political parties according to the model of Hitler's party, but rather the form of planned Nazi infiltration into government coalition parties according to Naumann's policy. But, first of all, because Dr. Adenauer's government is stupidly hostile to peace, the government has re-adopted, and in fact inherited, Hitler's aggressive policy against our neighbors...

The re-militarization of the Federal Republic is embodied in the "Blank Department" and Gehlen's organization. Working in the "Blank Department" and Gehlen's organization are former "SD" and "SS" officers who have tried resistance fighters and even killed them. All those who resisted with Hitler to a shameful end, and those who cannot yet come forward, or do not intend to come forward until they have obtained the right to wear their military medals, have found refuge in the "Blank Department" and Gehlen's organization.

John said that the entire atmosphere in the Federal Republic contributes to the revival of National Socialism and militarism. All this is due to the Americans' indulgence in hysterical fear of Communism, and they can see no other way out except to plan a crusade against the East. War does not come suddenly, like wind and rain. Only people can make war happen. Therefore, this also means that war can be prevented by people themselves. What we Germans are deeply concerned about is preventing a new war from originating in Germany or happening in Germany.

Our main task is to do everything possible to avoid the German people being used once again for new war adventures.

Dr. Adenauer's one-sided policy of making Germany dependent on the American "policy of strength" will inevitably cause war to break out on German soil.

John continued, saying that when I visited the United States in June of this year, I fully understood that we Germans have only one destiny in the hands of American policy, and that is to have German soldiers fight in a war in Europe against Communism.

"Germans, go to war!" This is the slogan that America gives us Germans. But war can still be prevented, as long as we refuse to carry out American plans. But to prevent war, it is also necessary to expose the real reasons for Bonn's policy of armament. Adenauer and the militarists manipulating behind the scenes see the "European Defense Community" as a means of establishing a strong German armed force, which, relying on its superiority, will sooner or later annex the armies of other countries, including the French army. As a result, France and Western Europe will once again fall into the hands of German militarism. When this goal is achieved, the "European Defense Community" treaty must be torn up. Officers of the General Staff such as Colonel Bonin hardly conceal this.

I do not want to hide, on the contrary, I should make it very clear that some German generals who have not learned anything from past history strategically want to use the "European Defense Community" treaty to station German corps in the territories of the member states of the "European Defense Community" in the simplest way. According to the provisions of the "European Defense Community" treaty, no lines of defense may be built between participating countries, which helps to achieve the above-mentioned purpose. To achieve this goal, Gehlen's organization is increasingly intensifying its activities in France.

All this means that someone is plotting to repeat Hitler's strategic plan: to launch a war against the East with the conquered West as a base.

I know all this very clearly, and I can no longer stay in West Germany without participating in these things and without being guilty of war crimes against the German people. This war crime is dangerous to Germany and will end in a new catastrophe. I only hope now that the French will understand the true, hidden reasons for the emergence of the "European Defense Community"; I only hope that a sincere mutual understanding will eventually be reached between Germany and France.

Dr. John finally said that the German people have the right to demand that the Federal Government truthfully and unreservedly tell them the purpose pursued by the "European Defense Community." But this has not been done so far. Dr. Adenauer asserted in his broadcast speech that there were no secret additional agreements to the "European Defense Community" treaty. Based on some facts that I know as a leader of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, I oppose this statement. I know that there are secret agreements to the "European Defense Community" treaty, and Dr. Adenauer is trying to keep these agreements secret.

I demand that Dr. Adenauer disclose these secret agreements to the Federal Parliament and the German people. If we want to find a way out, we must strive to re-establish a unified, peaceful Germany located between East and West through peaceful means.

Frankly speaking, it is unbelievable that the German people have not done what they should have done nine years after the end of the war, and are still indifferent to the division of Germany.

The reason why the Berlin Conference did not lead to the restoration of German unity should be attributed to the fact that the Bonn government did not make the slightest effort on this matter. If the Germans in the Federal Republic do not join hands with the Germans in the German Democratic Republic to take their destiny into their own hands in the future, then it will not be surprising that the major powers will still only theoretically study the issue of restoring German unity in the future.

I know, like everyone else, that many men and women in all resident strata and political parties in the Federal Republic regard the reunification of our motherland as a truly personal matter. I know that our economy must have exchanges with the East if it is to continue to survive. Other Western European countries are doing a lot of business with the East, but we have tied our hands because of the embargo. Isn't this absurd?

The whole problem at present is that we, East and West, should work together to end this intolerable phenomenon of German division.

I am now contributing my strength to such a task.

After making his speech, Dr. John then answered many questions from the reporters.

    前西德“保卫宪法局”局长荣恩在柏林发表声明
    揭露美国利用西德进行侵略战争的阴谋
    前西德“保卫宪法局”局长荣恩博士在争取德国统一委员会八月十一日在柏林组织的记者招待会上发表了一篇声明。出席这次招待会的有许多德国和外国记者。
    在威廉·吉尔诺斯博士代表委员会作了简短的发言后，荣恩博士说：
    各位先生：
    阿登纳博士今年八月六日广播了一篇关于“荣恩事件”的声明，把“荣恩事件”直接和“欧洲防务集团”问题联系起来。在原则上，不能认为这是错误，因为我今天在这里出现就是波恩“欧洲防务集团”政策和这个政策的后果迫使我这样做的。阿登纳博士宣称，据说我到现在为止说过的最重要的事情是我知道关于这个集团的条约的秘密附加协定。这种说法使我非常吃惊，因为我至今并没有说过一句关于“欧洲防务集团”条约的秘密附加协定的话。不过，我可以猜得出，阿登纳博士为什么要再三再四地否认这个条约的秘密附加协定的存在。我以后还要谈到这一点。
    首先，我愿说明，是我自己希望和要求召开这次记者招待会的，因为对我来说，向世界舆论讲话是一件非常重要的事情。
    我首先要指出，我今天无意与那些到现在为止一直在暗中诽谤我而且今天正在公开诽谤我的人们争论。这件事以后再作。不管人家对我捏造了些什么谰言，我的决定和行动完全是由我的信念所决定的，这种信念是基于我的经验和知识而产生的。我现在仍然和过去一样，在精神上是自由的，在政治上是无党无派的。
    每一个还没有在我们这个时代的生活的狂热的拍节的冲击下变得完全麻木不仁的人都会知道，或是至少会感觉到，我们有一种内在呼声，我们常常不愿意去听它，但是它一定终于会让我们听到。我第一次听到这种内在呼声是在三十年代之初，当时绍林吉亚州的内政部长弗立克下令各学校举行祷告，而在这种祷告中，用希特勒的名字代替了基督的名字，是这种内在呼声指引我从事反对国社党的斗争的，也正是这种声音使我来到了这里。
    我今天被人指责为叛徒，这已不是第一次了。那些现在正在大放厥辞的人们正是那些在十年前就指责过我叛国，并且在那时就很想把我绞死的人，这是很奇怪的事，也许决不是偶然的事。那些认识我或者至少对我有一种大致正确的看法的人知道，我并不是一个共产党人。
    现在正在捏造着和流传着的硬说我与东方有着长期合作关系的胡说是完全荒谬的，我认为，去理会这些谰言是有损我的身份的。
    我到这里来是出于对德国人民的将来的关怀，同时也是因为我在西方，至少是在联邦共和国没有这样一个发表意见的机会。在联邦共和国，曾经一度使国社党当权的势力已经复活到了这样的程度，以致于使我这样做成为根本不可能了。
    经过长期的考虑后，我决定到德意志民主共和国来，并留在这里，因为我看到，只有在这里才有最大可能的机会来为重新统一德国、反对新战争威胁而努力。在西德，甚至有许多聪明和正直的人都看不到威胁着我们的危险，因为他们为联邦政府的宣传所蒙蔽了。在德国，不是有许多人从一九四五年以来一直在说，他们没有能够在一九三三年以前看到国家社会主义的威胁吗？因此，我认为我有责任在现在公开地、认真地警告德国人民注意今天威胁着我们的危险。
    等到第一声炮响时，就来不及了。
    当我在一九五○年十二月在联邦共和国担任我的机关的领导职务时，我曾幻想我能从事建设新德国的工作，这个德国，一旦肃清了国家社会主义，就能使所有德国人都有过和平生活的机会。相反的，我们今天所看到的是一个分裂的德国，这个德国由于东方和西方的分歧而有成为一个新战场的危险，这不仅将给我们带来巨大的灾难，更重要的是，这将摧毁我们作为一个国家而存在的根本基础。
    共产主义，不论我们喜欢不喜欢，是一个现实，它团结了居住在这个星球上的将近一半的人。
  “再度消灭共产主义”的梦想和希特勒打算消灭基督教的意图是一样狂妄的。聪明的英国人已经正确地了解到这一点，因此，他们正在设法和占半个世界的共产党人取得暂时的协议。然而美国人还不愿意认识到这一点，他们认为他们迟早总能利用一支反对东方的新十字军来消灭共产主义，他们目前正在准备战争。
    由于波恩条约和巴黎条约，联邦共和国已成为美国在欧洲的政策的工具。
    美国需要德国兵来从事对东方的战争。他们对于某些人特别感兴趣，这种人已经忘记了一九四五年的灾难的教训，并且一直在等待着“为一九四五年的失败报复”。这就是为什么地地道道的纳粹分子和军国主义者在联邦共和国中又“到法庭重新受审”的原因。例如，联邦政府中就有一个在波兰执行“希特勒式的德国化政策”，采取使得正直的德国人在全世界面前也大丢其脸的野蛮措施的某部部长奥勃兰德尔。
    内政部第一国务秘书莱克斯对于像奥勃兰德尔这样一个著名的纳粹分子在政府中占有一个席位的事实感到震惊，他最近在一次非正式谈话中向我说，“我们在对待纳粹方面又做得太过火了”。
    但是，在联邦共和国中有谁敢公开这么说呢？奥勃兰德尔打发掉了他的前任的享有真正民主分子之誉的助手，而起用了希特勒东部占领地区部的纳粹分子来代替他们，这也是很自然的。
    每一个地方：在行政机关中、在经济部门、工业部门和大学里，不管你往哪里看，纳粹分子已再次巩固了他们的地位，并复活了曾使德国人民遭到总崩溃的精神。由于大赦，现在甚至有机会让那些在一九四五年逃过了应有处罚的纳粹分子复职。有一个名叫勒维肯博士的人，他是前纳粹党党员，曾在他写的赞扬一九二三年希特勒暴动的“血腥证人”之一的一本书“在永远岗位上的哨兵”中，暴露了他的纳粹本质，现在他竟作了“欧洲人联盟”——联邦共和国中的一个促进德国人和法国人谅解的组织——的主席，这完全是开玩笑，他就是在第三帝国时代曾宣传并推行一种给法国人民带来了这样多的苦难的人，现在他竟来做“促进”德国人和法国人谅解的工作，这不是一个讽刺吗？勒维肯博士一点也不犹豫地邀请法国法西斯分子莫里斯·巴尔德哈在去年到汉堡来与“欧洲人联盟”盟员公开见面。
    诸位从这里也可以看出，波恩的法—德相互谅解实际上是什么东西。
    我还非常清楚地知道，瑙曼和阿亨巴赫二位先生（现在还要加上从法国监狱中释放出来的阿伯兹大使）正在紧张地工作来实行他们的重新纳粹化计划。他们坚决地把愈来愈多的他们的同类安置在重要位置上。
    当英国人在去年一月逮捕瑙曼的时候，联邦政府曾企图使用各种方法来减轻正在复活的国家社会主义所遭到的危险。瑙曼案件到今天还没有审讯，因为联邦政府对于认真地消除国家社会主义是不感兴趣的，因为那些怙恶不悛的纳粹分子又再度被利用来对东方发动十字军了。
    纳粹分子甚至渗入到自由民主党——我觉得我自己和这个政党的真正的自由主义力量是有密切联系的——中。
    纳粹分子控制着北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州的自由民主党，这老早就是一个公开的秘密了。阿诺德先生不得不在北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州政府中容纳自由民主党的代表这一事实说明纳粹分子再度使用了如何大的压力。他们今天的口号是：“用合法的手段再度取得权力！”
    凡是纳粹分子得到了立脚点的地方，就为军国主义分子打开了大门。前元帅曼斯坦刚从威尔堡被释放，阿登纳博士就堂而皇之地为他举行正式招待会。以前一度和希特勒一道使我们人民遭受彻底破坏的那些将军们不但早就被释放了，而且得到了可以令人羡慕的津贴。
    假如这些人从他们的痛苦经验中得到了教训，而且参加新德国的和平建设，那么，没有人会说他们不应从纳税人的贡献中分得适当的生活费。但是，当以前的将军们，例如得到高于一个实际负责的部长的津贴的拉姆凯先生不断地在公开演说中和在报纸上，用嘲弄的口气来诋毁民主和攻击法国时，这就使人不得不起来反对了。我也曾不止一次地要求负责当局注意这一事实。然而，他们从没有采取任何步骤。
    再举一个例子吧。今天在法院和公开场合以“专家”身份出现，为那些狂热地执行过希特勒的“干到底”政策的军官们辩护的凯塞林先生，以前就曾发布过命令屠杀那些反对他们的疯狂命令的无辜者。被选为自由民主党联邦议院议员的前将军曼陀菲尔，据他的最亲密的朋友说，是一个彻头彻尾的纳粹分子……始终在“军人联合会”幕后操纵的前将军特莱特纳是这样一些军官中的一个：他们从未掩饰过，就信仰来说，他们仍然和过去一样是他们的“元首”的狂热的追随者……
    荣恩接着说，不可救药的纳粹分子经常不断地渗入联邦共和国的重要职位这一事实，是阿登纳政策的后果，阿登纳主要依靠那些和希特勒一起企图“消灭布尔什维主义”的集团。
    这种渗入还没有采取按照希特勒的党的样子来组织政党的形式，而是依照瑙曼的方针，采取纳粹分子有计划地渗入政府联合党派的形式，但是，首先是因为阿登纳博士的政府愚笨地敌视和平，政府重新采取了，事实上是继承了希特勒反对我们邻邦的侵略政策……
    联邦共和国的重新军国主义化体现在“布兰克部”和盖伦的组织上。在“布兰克部”和盖伦组织内工作的有前“SD”和“党卫军”的官员，他们曾审判过抵抗战士，甚至杀过他们。所有那些和希特勒一起顽抗到可耻的结局的人，以及那些还不能出头露面，或者是在没有得到带自己的军事勋章的权利前还不打算出头露面的人，都在“布兰克部”和盖伦组织内找到了避难所。
    荣恩说，联邦共和国中的整个气氛有助于复活国家社会主义和军国主义。这一切都是由于美国人沉溺于对共产主义的歇斯底里的恐惧而产生的，他们除去策划对东方进行十字军远征外，再也看不到其他出路。战争并不是像风雨一样，一下子突然到来的。只有人才能使战争发生。因而这也就是说，战争也是可以靠人们自己来防止的。我们德国人所切身关怀的就是防止起因于德国或是在德国发生的新战争。
    我们的主要任务就是尽一切力量避免使德国人民再一次被利用来从事新的战争冒险。
    阿登纳博士所实行的使德国依赖美国“实力政策”的片面方针的政策不可避免地要使战争在德国境内发生。
    荣恩接着说，当今年六月间我访问美国时，我完全明白了，我们德国人在美国政策的掌握之中只有一个命运，就是使德国士兵为在欧洲反对共产主义而进行战争。
      “德国人，上战场吧！”这就是美国给我们德国人的一句口号。但战争还是可以防止的，只要我们拒绝执行美国的计划。但是，要防止战争，也就必须揭露波恩实行武装政策的真正原因。阿登纳和在幕后操纵的军国主义分子把“欧洲防务集团”看成是建立强大的德国武装力量的手段，这一支武装力量依仗它的优势迟早要吞并其他国家的军队，包括法国军队在内，结果法国和西欧将又一次落在德国军国主义的掌握中。当这一目的达到之后，“欧洲防务集团”条约就一定要被撕毁。如波宁上校这样一些参谋总部的军官几乎毫不隐讳这一点。
    我不想掩饰，相反地我应该十分清楚地说明，那些从过去历史中没有得到任何教训的一些德国将军们在策略上想利用“欧洲防务集团”条约，以便用最简单的方法使德国的兵团驻扎到“欧洲防务集团”各成员国的领土上。根据“欧洲防务集团”条约的规定，参加国之间不得筑有任何防线，这就有助于达到上述目的。为了达到这个目的，盖伦的组织在法国正在日益加紧活动。
    这一切都意味着，有人正阴谋重复希特勒的战略计划：以被征服的西方为基地，向东方发动战争。
    我对这一切知道得很清楚，我无法再留在西德而不参加这些事情和不因战争勾当而对德国人民负罪。这种战争勾当对德国是危险的，并且会以新的浩劫而告终。我现在只希望：法国人会了解到产生“欧洲防务集团”的真正的、隐秘的原因；只希望德国和法国之间终究会达成真诚的互相谅解。
    荣恩博士最后说，德国人民首先有权要求联邦政府真实地和毫无保留地告诉他们“欧洲防务集团”所追求的目的。但是，直到现在还没有这样做过。阿登纳博士在自己的广播演说中曾一口咬定说，“欧洲防务集团”条约没有任何秘密附加协定。我根据我作为联邦保卫宪法局的一个领导人所知道的一些事实反对这种说法。我知道，“欧洲防务集团”条约是有秘密协定的，而阿登纳博士企图对这些协定保守秘密。
    我要求阿登纳博士向联邦议院和德国人民公开这些秘密协定。如果我们想找活路，就得争取通过和平的方法重新建立一个位于东西方之间的统一、和平的德国。
    老实说，战争结束九年了，德国人民还没有做自己该做的事，还对德国的分裂采取漠不关心的态度，这是不可思议的。
    柏林会议之所以没有导致德国统一的恢复，应当归咎于波恩政府对这件事没有作丝毫努力。如果今后联邦共和国的德国人还不和德意志民主共和国的德国人一起来把命运掌握在自己手中，那么，今后几个大国仍然将只在理论上研究恢复德国统一的问题，那是不足为奇的。
    我和大家一样知道，联邦共和国各居民阶层和各政治党派中，有许多男女把我们祖国的重新统一看成是真正切身相关的事。我知道，我们的经济如果要继续维持下去，就必须和东方进行交流。别的西欧国家正在和东方大做其生意，而我们却由于禁运而把手捆绑了起来，这不是荒谬的吗？
    目前整个问题在于：我们，东部和西部，应当共同努力来结束德国分裂这种不能令人容忍的现象。
    我现在就把力量贡献给这样一个任务。
    荣恩博士在发表谈话后，接着回答了记者们的许多问题。
