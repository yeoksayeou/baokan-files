In order to ensure and consolidate the fixed and long-term tutoring relationships between professional arts troupes and factories and mines, and to continuously improve the level of workers' amateur artistic activities, following the signing of a tutoring contract between the Beijing Film Actors Troupe and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Central Song and Dance Troupe and the Beijing People's Printing Plant recently signed a song and dance tutoring contract for a term of two years. This contract was signed on the basis of past tutoring. The Central Song and Dance Troupe began conducting song and dance tutoring at the Beijing People's Printing Plant in March of this year, and achieved certain results. The signing of the contract further solidified this tutoring relationship. It is expected that after two years of tutoring, the Beijing People's Printing Plant's worker amateur song and dance team will cultivate a group of song and dance backbones with a certain professional level on the existing basis, laying the foundation for the establishment of a typical worker amateur song and dance troupe.

The China Youth Art Theatre, the Central Experimental Opera House, the Beijing People's Art Theatre, and the Central People's Broadcasting Station Ballad Troupe and other professional arts groups will also sign arts activity tutoring contracts with Chengzi Coal Mine, Changxindian Railway Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Beijing Knitted Printing and Dyeing Factory, and the Liulihe Cement Plant, respectively.

    专业文艺团体和厂矿签订文艺活动辅导合同
    为了保证和巩固各专业文艺团体和厂矿建立固定的、较长期的辅导关系，并使工人业余艺术活动水平不断提高起见，继北京电影演员剧团和石景山钢铁厂签订辅导合同之后，最近中央歌舞团和北京人民印刷厂签订了歌舞辅导合同，期限是两年。这个合同是在过去已有的辅导基础上签订的。中央歌舞团在今年三月开始到北京人民印刷厂进行歌舞辅导工作，获得了一定的成绩。合同的签订，使这种辅导关系更进一步地固定起来。预计经过两年的辅导，北京人民印刷厂的工人业余歌舞队将在原有的基础上培养出一批具有一定业务水平的歌舞骨干，为建立一个典型的工人业余歌舞团打下基础。
    中国青年艺术剧院、中央实验歌剧院、北京人民艺术剧院和中央人民广播电台说唱团等专业文艺团体，也将分别和城子煤矿、长辛店铁路机车车辆修理厂、北京机织印染厂、琉璃河水泥厂等签订文艺活动辅导合同。
