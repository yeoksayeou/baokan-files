Xinhua News Agency, 10th:

    Under the instigation of the United States, remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Taiwan attacked our naval patrol, and bombed the Xiangshan area of ​​Zhejiang.
    At 21:00 on the 4th, a PB-4Y patrol bomber of the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Taiwan bombed the Xiangshan area of ​​Zhejiang, dropping nine bombs, including incendiary bombs and airburst bombs.
    At 02:30 on the 9th, our patrol fleet was performing patrol missions in the sea near Tayu, Fujian. At that time, two naval vessels of the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Taiwan suddenly attacked our patrol fleet, firing dozens of shells. After being counterattacked by us, they fled.
    This intensified piratical armed provocation by the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Taiwan against our coastal areas is inseparable from the recent series of evil activities by American warmongers who openly clamored to use armed force to block our army from liberating Taiwan, stepped up equipping and training of the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, and conspired to expand American aggression against our territory. The Chinese people are closely watching the Chiang bandits' banditry.

    残余蒋匪袭击我艇队并轰炸象山地区
    【新华社十日讯】在美国纵使下，台湾国民党残余匪军向我军巡逻艇队袭击，并轰炸我浙东象山地区。
    四日二十一时，台湾国民党残余匪军PB—4Y型巡逻轰炸机一架，轰炸我浙东象山地区，投弹九枚。内有燃烧弹和空爆弹。
    九日晨二时三十分，我巡逻艇队，在福建塔屿附近海面执行巡逻任务。当时，有台湾国民党残余匪军的海军军舰二艘，向我巡逻艇队进行突然袭击，发炮数十发，遭我反击后逸去。
    台湾国民党残余匪军这种向我沿海地区加紧进行海盗式武装挑衅行动，是和最近以来美国战争贩子公开叫嚣武装阻拦我军解放台湾，加紧装备、训练国民党残余匪军和阴谋扩大美国侵略我国领土的一连串罪恶活动分不开的。中国人民正密切注视着蒋匪的强盗行为。
