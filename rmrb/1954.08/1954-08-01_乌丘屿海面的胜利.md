    Victory on the Sea off Wuchiu Island
    Qi Hei

    I
    The People's Navy vigilantly guards the motherland's sea defenses, as stipulated in the draft constitution, protecting the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and safeguarding the integrity of national and territorial sovereignty. The victory on the sea off Wuchiu Island is a heroic example of the People's Navy defending the sea frontier.
    In February of this year, gales blew for several days in a row, stirring up columns of water more than ten feet high outside the breakwater. The gunboats were anchored in the inner harbor, and the waves constantly slammed onto the deck. The fishermen's sailboats were also moored in the depths of the bay.
    On the 24th, the sea suddenly calmed down. Fishing boats raised their white sails and sailed towards the outer sea in groups of three or five.
    In the afternoon, a certain boat captain returned from a meeting at the detachment headquarters and called all the comrades on the boat for a talk. Everyone was wondering what was going on, but no one could guess what it was.
    "Comrades, the time to strive for merit for the people has come!" The young Captain Qi Fenggang's first sentence grabbed the hearts of every comrade, and everyone listened with bated breath.
    "The sea is calm and the wind is smooth. According to the superiors' judgment, the enemy is likely to come out to harass us. We cannot allow the enemy to be rampant in our sea. We must teach the enemy a heavy lesson... In battle, we must fight steadily, accurately, and ruthlessly!" The captain waved his hand and then ended his speech, "Get ready, comrades, I wish us victory tomorrow!"
    After the mobilization, everyone was busy inside and outside the cabin, wiping the artillery again and again, checking the machinery over and over, not even letting go of the smallest details.
    "Squad leader, I must strive for merit in this battle!" Liu Yonglin, a 19-year-old member of the Youth League, expressed his determination to the squad leader while inspecting the artillery.
    Squad Leader Wang raised his head and saw the young man looking down and wiping the shells again. Looking at his focused work, he couldn't help but think of the scene from a few days ago: Liu Yonglin had just been transferred from a certain boat and was reluctant to leave the comrades on the original boat, even clamoring to go back. After a few days, he became familiar with everyone and no longer mentioned going back. Now that Squad Leader Wang heard Liu Yonglin say this, he thought: What a good comrade he is. He replied seriously:
    "Yes, we must test ourselves in battle!"

    II
    At five o'clock the next morning, through the dawn mist, Venus was still shining coldly in the sky. The boat set sail.
    The south line was commanded by the battalion commander himself with two boats; the north line was commanded by the detachment leader Zhou Qing with two boats, sailing towards the sea west of the enemy island of Wuchiu. The north and south lines were prepared to encircle the enemy.
    It was not yet dawn, and the sea was filled with heavy fog. The gunboats broke through the waves in the fog sea, and the bow stirred up waves, throwing them on the deck and then breaking them into the sea.
    After traveling more than ten nautical miles, the east was already turning white, and the fog was slowly dissipating. At this time, Wuchiu Island was faintly visible. But it was still far from the ambush site. The detachment leader looked at his watch, it was already 6:20.
    "Report to the detachment leader, two enemy ships have been spotted!"
    The enemy appeared earlier than we originally estimated. But the detachment leader did not hesitate, he reported the enemy situation to the battalion commander on the one hand, and issued an order on the other:
    "First-level combat readiness, advance at high speed!"
    The crew quickly entered battle positions. The two gunboats were like arrows leaving the string, heading straight for the left front of the enemy ships.
    It was not yet time to raise the flag, but the detachment leader ordered again:
    "Raise the national flag and let the enemy know that we are going to eliminate them!"
    The Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Hai Zhu" gunboat, which was sailing in front, fled in the direction of Wuchiu Island after discovering our gunboat. When the enemy boat was only four or five thousand meters away from Wuchiu Island, Zhou Qing commanded the two boats to concentrate their fire and fired together. "Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!" Hundreds of shells fell on the "Hai Zhu" like a rainstorm, knocking the boat body askew, and most of the bandits on the boat were killed or injured. The enemy hurriedly fled for their lives, not even bothering to return fire, and went straight into the port of Wuchiu Island.
    The motor sailboat "Lida" came up from behind and opened fire on us. Our gunboat quickly turned around, and with a "boom," the first shot blew the enemy boat's radio operator and the machine into the sea.
    "Good shot! Beat them hard!" The captain's cheerful voice came from the command platform. The gunners became more and more energetic. Take Liu Yonglin, for example, the seemingly weak young man carried eighty-five shells in one breath. How could he not be happy when every shot hit the mark!
    Seven hundred meters, three hundred meters, seeing that the distance from the enemy ship was only one or two hundred meters, unexpectedly the front main gun of our boat malfunctioned. At this moment, an enemy shell exploded on the hatch in front of the command platform. Liu Yonglin, who was receiving shells at the hatch, was seriously injured, and several other comrades were also injured.
    "Rudder right thirty!" The captain immediately issued an order. The boat body turned sideways, with the bow facing the enemy ship. The shells that came over brushed past the two sides and fell into the sea.
    Squad Leader Wang picked up Comrade Liu Yonglin, his heart felt like it was being pricked by needles. He gritted his teeth and carefully sent him into the cabin for bandaging.
    In the squad leader's arms, Liu Yonglin thought that he could not continue fighting and said to the squad leader: "Squad leader, I can't do it anymore, you must fight resolutely!" Soon, he said goodbye to his comrades forever. In the last few seconds before he stopped breathing, he murmured: "It is glorious to serve the people and sacrifice."
    Comrade Liu Yonglin's sacrifice ignited the flames of revenge in the hearts of the comrades, and everyone shouted: "Avenge Comrade Liu Yonglin!" "Resolutely eliminate the enemy!"
    Detachment Leader Zhou saw a machine gun on the enemy ship firing "dada" and wished he could crush it with one hand. He gritted his teeth, picked up the machine gun and swept it, and shot the guy down.
    The rocket launcher in the rear cabin of the enemy ship appeared again, just as the malfunction of the front main gun of our boat was resolved, and one shot silenced it!
    The gunners became more and more angry as they fought. Comrade Tao Baorong, the turning hand who was wounded in three places, insisted on staying in his battle position; Comrade Dong Quan, the elevation hand, was wounded in his right leg and could not fire, so he knelt on the deck to load shells. The shells dragged flames, pressing over fiercely, and finally beat the enemy so that none of them dared to show their faces. Several places on the deck caught fire, and the ship spun around in the water.
    Our boat approached the enemy ship. Signalman Wu Cailiang, holding a submachine gun, took the lead in jumping on, and several comrades followed and jumped on.
    Wu Cailiang was short, only eighteen years old, and had never smelled gunpowder since joining the army. No one thought that he could jump on the enemy ship to capture prisoners so bravely for the first time. He alone drove ten prisoners out of the cabin. One guy even tried to pull out a pistol. Wu Cailiang shouted, "Don't move!" The guy obediently raised his hands.
    After the prisoners were captured, the detachment leader ordered to tow the ship. But after two attempts, the anchor cables broke. The fire on the enemy ship burned more and more fiercely and slowly sank.
    At this time, a gunboat came from the south of Wuchiu Island, but was bombed back by us with a few shots from far away. The three planes sent by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on Jinmen Island were also driven away by us.

    III
    The battle went very smoothly. From start to finish, it took only one hour. When Battalion Commander Wang led the gunboats from the outer sea, the two boats led by Detachment Leader Zhou Qing were already on their way back.
    At 11:40 a.m., the boat team returned victoriously, carrying twenty-four prisoners.
    The beach was crowded with local people and brother troops. The sound of gongs and drums, firecrackers, applause, and cheers resounded.
    The sailors got off the boat, the "August 1st" cap badges shining red under the sunlight, and their healthy faces were filled with victorious smiles.

    乌丘屿海面的胜利
    漆　黑
    一
    人民海军警惕地守卫着祖国的海防，如宪法草案中所规定的，他们保卫着人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫着国家和领土主权的完整。乌丘屿海面的胜利，就是人民海军保卫海防的一个英勇的战例。
    今年二月，接连几天刮着暴风，在防浪堤外掀起一丈多高的水柱。炮艇在内港抛锚，浪头不时地朝甲板上猛打过来。渔民的帆船也都停泊在港湾深处。
    二十四日这一天，海面突然平静下来。渔船都扬起了白帆，三五成群地向外海驶去。
    下午，某艇艇长从分队部开会回来，召集全艇同志讲话。大伙儿心里直琢磨，但谁也猜不透究竟是怎么回事。
    “同志们，争取为人民立功的时候到了！”青年艇长漆凤岗同志这头一句话，就抓住了每个同志的心，大家都屏声静气地听着。
    “海上风平浪静，根据上级的判断，敌人很可能出来骚扰。我们不能让敌人在我们的海面上猖狂，我们要以沉重的打击，教训敌人。……在战斗中我们要打得稳、打得准、打得狠！”艇长用手一挥，然后结束了他的讲话，“准备去吧，同志们，预祝我们明天胜利！”
    动员后，大家都在舱里舱外忙着，火炮擦了又擦，机器检查了一遍又一遍，哪怕是最细小的地方也不放过。
    “班长，我一定要在这次战斗中争取立功！”十九岁的青年团员刘永林同志在检查火炮时，向班长表示自己的决心。
    王班长抬起头来，看见这小伙子又低着头在擦炮弹，看着他那专心工作的样子，不禁使他想起了前些日子的情景：那时刘永林刚从某艇调来，舍不得离开原来艇上的同志，还吵着要回去。过不了几天，他跟大伙一熟，就不再提回去的事了。现在班长听刘永林这么说，心想：这是个多好的小同志啊，他严肃地回答道：
    “对，我们要在战斗中来考验自己！”二  第二天早上五点钟，透过黎明的雾，启明星还在天上闪着冷清的光芒。艇起航了。
    南线由大队长亲自指挥两艘艇；北线由分队长周卿指挥两艘艇，朝敌岛乌丘屿以西海面驶去。南北两线准备夹击敌人。
    天还没亮，海上弥漫着大雾。炮艇在雾海中破浪前进，船头激起一朵朵浪花，抛在甲板上，又跌碎在海里。
    走了十多浬，东方已发白，雾也慢慢地消散了。这时乌丘屿已隐约可见。但距离伏击地点还很远。分队长看看手表，已经六点二十分了。
    “报告分队长，发现敌船两艘！”
    敌人的出现的时间比我们原来估计的还早。但分队长毫不犹豫，他一面向大队长报告敌情，一面下达命令：
      “一级备战，高速前进！”
    艇上人员迅速进入战位。两艘炮艇像离弦的疾箭，直朝敌船左前方驶去。
    本来还不到升旗的时刻，但分队长又下命令说：
   “把国旗升起来，让敌人知道，我们要消灭他！”
    驶在前面的那条蒋匪“海珠”号炮艇，发现我炮艇以后，即朝乌丘屿方向逃遁。当敌艇距离乌丘屿只有四五千公尺时，周卿指挥的两艇集中火力，一齐发射，“咚！咚！咚！咚！”百十发炮弹像一阵暴雨似的落在“海珠”号上，把艇身打歪了，艇上匪军伤亡大半。敌人急忙逃命，也顾不上还炮，
  一直钻进乌丘屿港内去了。
    后面那条机帆船“利达”号赶来，向我开火。我们的炮艇迅速掉过头去，“轰”的一声，第一炮就把敌船上的报话员连带机子一起掀到海里去了。
    “打得好！狠狠地揍呀！”指挥台上传来了艇长快活的声音。炮手们越打越来劲，单拿刘永林来说吧，看去还很单弱的小伙子，一口气就搬上了八十五发炮弹。发发打响，怎叫他心里不乐啊！
    七百公尺，三百公尺，眼看距离敌船只有一二百公尺了，不料我某艇的前主炮出了故障。就在这时，一颗敌人的炮弹在指挥台前面的舱口上爆炸了。刘永林正在舱口接炮弹，受了重伤，另外几个同志也负伤了。
      “右舵三十！”艇长立即发出命令。艇身侧转过来，船头朝向敌船。打过来的炮弹便从两舷擦过去，掉在海里了。
    王班长抱起刘永林同志，心里像针扎似的。他咬着牙，小心地把他送进舱里去包扎。
    刘永林在班长怀里，想到自己不能继续战斗，对班长说：“班长，我不行了，你们坚决干吧！”不久，他就与同志们永别了。在停止呼吸前几秒钟，他口里还喃喃地说：“为人民服务，牺牲是光荣的。”
    刘永林同志的牺牲，燃烧起同志们复仇的火焰，大家高呼：“为刘永林同志复仇！”“坚决消灭敌人！”
    周分队长看见敌船上一挺机枪在“哒哒”响，真恨不得一手把它捏碎。他咬紧牙，端过机枪来一扫，就把那家伙射倒了。
    敌船后舱那门火箭炮又冒出来了，刚好我某艇前主炮的故障排除掉，一炮就把它打成了哑巴！
    炮手们越打越光火。三处负伤的旋回手陶宝荣同志，始终坚持在战位上；俯仰手东全同志右腿负伤，不能击发，便跪在甲板上填炮弹。炮弹拖着火光，猛烈地压过去，最后打得敌人一个也不敢露面，舱面上好几个地方着火，船在水上打起转来。
    我某艇靠上了敌船。信号员吴才良端着冲锋枪抢先跳上去，后面几个同志也跟着跳上去了。
    吴才良个子矮矮的，才十八岁，参军以来还未闻过火药味呢，谁也没想到他第一次就能这样勇敢地跳上敌船抓俘虏。光他自己一人就从舱里赶上来十个俘虏，有一个家伙还想掏手枪，吴才良大喝一声“不要动！”那家伙便乖乖地把手举起来。
    俘虏抓过来以后，分队长命令拖船。但拖了两次，锚缆都断了。敌船上的火势越烧越旺，慢慢沉下去了。
    这时从乌丘屿南面来了一艘炮艇，被我们轰了几炮，打老远就紧忙缩回去了。金门岛蒋匪派来的三架飞机，也被我们打跑了。三  战斗进行得非常顺利，从开始到结束，前后不过一个钟头。当王大队长所率领的炮艇从外海赶来时，周卿分队长所带领的两艘艇已在返航途中。
    艇队于上午十一时四十分，载着二十四个俘虏胜利归来。
    海滩上围满了驻地群众和兄弟部队，锣鼓声、鞭炮声、掌声、欢呼声响成一片。
    水兵们从艇上下来，“八一”帽徽在阳光底下闪耀着红灿灿的光辉，健康的脸上堆满胜利的微笑。
