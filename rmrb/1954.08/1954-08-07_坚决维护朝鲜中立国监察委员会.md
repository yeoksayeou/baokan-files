Resolutely Safeguard the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea
Li Gao
Dulles' arrogant remarks at a press conference on August 3 confirmed that the purpose of Washington and Seoul's simultaneous concentrated attacks on the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was to unilaterally abolish this supervisory body and undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Dulles openly stated that the United States would raise the issue of "dissolving" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission at the next United Nations General Assembly. He also admitted that this latest step by the United States to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement was in accordance with a long-planned scheme. As early as the Geneva Conference, the United States had "held some informal talks on ending the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission" with other countries that participated in the Korean War. According to a "Reuters" report on August 4: "Britain and other allies who participated in the Korean War agree with the United States' view" that the so-called "Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has lost its effectiveness."

This exposes to the world that during the Geneva Conference, the reason why the United States launched large-scale slanders and attacks on the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was, in addition to hindering the discussion of the Indochina armistice supervision issue, to prepare for the United States' illegal actions to abolish the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Now that Washington has just held the US-Rhee talks, and South Korea has begun a series of organized atrocities that endanger the neutral nations inspection personnel, this is a further conspiracy in the United States' plan to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. It is even less surprising that the US military authorities in Korea have adopted an attitude of "not paying public attention" and "keeping silent" to encourage South Korea's blatant violations of the armistice agreement.

Facts have proved that Dulles' arrogant remarks and the Rhee Syngman clique's clamor are in the same tune. Dulles falsely accused the Polish and Czechoslovakian inspection personnel of "espionage" activities in South Korea, and Won Yong-duk also threatened to arrest Polish and Czech inspection personnel based on this "crime." At the same time, according to "Kyodo News," so-called "well-informed sources" in Seoul openly admitted that Rhee Syngman and Won Yong-duk's statements clamoring to tear up the armistice agreement "may have been made with the tacit consent of the United States."

However, Dulles shamelessly attempted to shift the blame for the United States' deliberate undermining of the Korean Armistice Agreement and its conspiracy to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission onto others. He did not hesitate to use the already bankrupt despicable means again, repeating the slanderous clichés that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission "is not working" and "cannot carry out proper inspection work in Communist North Korea," etc. He even slanderously accused us of "clearly violating the armistice agreement," and then clamored that the United Nations Command might "really abolish the armistice agreement."

Obviously, Dulles was just revealing his entire conspiracy plan to undermine the armistice agreement. As for his clichés, whether they are slandering the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission or slandering the Korean and Chinese sides, they have long been refuted by ironclad facts and are completely untenable.

Our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai once cited irrefutable facts at the Geneva Conference to prove that "in the ten months of the Korean armistice, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has played a positive role in assisting the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement." "Although the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has encountered some difficulties in its work, its contributions and achievements cannot be denied." At that time, Dulles and other slanderers could not raise any objections to this fair judgment, because the obvious fact is that it is precisely because the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission can still play a positive role and has repeatedly exposed the US side's violations of the armistice agreement and the illegal import of reinforcement combat materials that the US side hates it so much and is eager to abolish it.

As in the past, Dulles is now groundlessly accusing the Korean and Chinese sides of "violating the armistice agreement," but this time Dulles' situation seems even worse, and he has to admit that he "has not obtained detailed information on the situation in North Korea," and he bases it only on what "general impressions." The emptiness of the slanderer is evident.

Another despicable trick that Dulles has been playing is to try to create so-called "dissatisfaction" and "withdrawal from this committee" among the Swiss and Swedish members in order to achieve the United States' goal of undermining the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. However, serving in the work of supervising the Korean armistice is a sacred task to maintain peace in Korea and world peace, and neutral countries that respect this task should not fall into the US trap. This time, the four members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission jointly wrote to the Korean Military Armistice Commission, accusing the US side of serious incidents endangering the safety of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's inspection personnel, and requested the US side to take effective measures to ensure the normal working conditions of the Neutral Nations inspection teams. This is completely legitimate. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has the right to order the US side to immediately end the current atrocities endangering the Neutral Nations inspection personnel and protect their safety and work. The spokesman for the Swiss delegation has also categorically denied the rumors fabricated by the American news agency that the Swiss government agreed to Dulles' dissolution of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which once again exposes the United States' despicable conspiracy.

All peace-loving people in the world and every country willing to consolidate peace in Korea must be vigilant against the US's conspiracy plan to gradually disintegrate and completely destroy the armistice agreement.

Dulles' attempt to coerce its allies in the next United Nations General Assembly to undermine the provisions of the armistice agreement concerning the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is not permissible. Article 61 of the armistice agreement clearly stipulates that "amendments and supplements to this armistice agreement must be agreed upon by the commanders of both opposing sides." Any unilateral action by the United Nations, which has become a belligerent party, regarding the Korean Armistice Agreement is illegal. If any country follows the United States in carrying out this conspiracy, it will facilitate the United States and Rhee Syngman in undermining the armistice agreement, threatening the Korean armistice, and bearing serious consequences.

Now, Dulles has completely exposed the United States' conspiracy plan to "dissolve" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. It is impossible for him to make people lose their vigilance against his gradual implementation of this plan. Dulles said deceitfully that dissolving the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission would not affect the status quo of the armistice. He said: "Certain parts of the armistice agreement may have become obsolete or unworkable, and these parts can be regarded as invalid without affecting the entire armistice agreement." However, people know that the US side has already undermined "the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and looted more than 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war; at the same time, it has prevented the Korean political conference from being held, undermined the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, and now the US-Rhee Washington talks have openly stated that Rhee Syngman will "unify" Korea, attempting to block the path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. If the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is unilaterally abolished again, the US side can freely violate the armistice agreement, expand South Korea's military power, and prepare to restart the war. All of this is absolutely not permissible. The Korean Armistice Agreement is a solemn whole, and every clause and every part of it must be fully implemented, and must not be violated or separated. Article 62 of the Korean Armistice Agreement clearly stipulates: "The provisions of this Armistice Agreement shall remain in effect until expressly superseded either by mutually acceptable amendments and additions or by appropriate provisions in a political settlement at a higher level of both sides." Therefore, we must never allow the US side to abandon and disintegrate the armistice agreement step by step, and we must safeguard the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

At the emergency meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission held on August 3, the US side, under the pressure of the solemn protests of the Korean and Chinese sides and the condemnation of world public opinion, had to express its willingness to fulfill its obligations to the personnel and work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in the future and give them full protection. The US chief member, Britton, also expressed to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that the United Nations Command would "guarantee to try to end" the terrorist activities in South Korea. However, Dulles' announced conspiracy plan to dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission cannot help but make people doubt the value of the promises made by the US side. The Korean and Chinese sides and the peace-loving people of the world should heighten their vigilance and resolutely oppose any crime committed by the US side to undermine the armistice agreement.

    坚决维护朝鲜中立国监察委员会
    李高
    杜勒斯在八月三日的记者招待会上发表了狂妄的谈话，证实了华盛顿和汉城同时集中攻击中立国监察委员会的目的，是企图片面取消这个监察机构，破坏朝鲜停战协定。
    杜勒斯公开说，美国要向下届联合国大会提出
  “解散”中立国监察委员会的问题。他并且承认美国这个又一破坏朝鲜停战协定的步骤，乃是按照美国蓄谋已久的预定计划行事的。早在日内瓦会议时，美国就曾与其他侵朝国家“进行过一些关于结束中立国监察委员会的非正式会谈”。据“路透社”八月四日报道：“英国和参加朝鲜战争的其他盟国都同意美国的看法”，即所谓“中立国监察委员会已经失去效用了”。
    这就向全世界暴露了：在日内瓦会议期间，美国所以对朝鲜中立国监察委员会发动大规模的诽谤攻击，其目的除了阻挠印度支那停战监察问题的讨论以外，就是要替美国取消朝鲜中立国监察委员会的非法行动进行准备。现在，华盛顿刚刚举行过美李会谈，南朝鲜就开始了一连串危害中立国视察人员的有组织的暴行，这正是美国取消中立国监察委员会的计划的进一步的阴谋。侵朝美军当局对南朝鲜公然违反停战协定的暴行，采取“不予公开注意”和“缄默”的怂恿态度，那就更加不足为奇了。
    事实证明，杜勒斯的狂妄谈话，和这次李承晚集团的叫嚣，是出于同一调子的。杜勒斯诬蔑波兰和捷克斯洛伐克视察人员在南朝鲜坚持的公正工作为“间谍”活动，元容德也威胁说要根据这个“罪名”逮捕波、捷视察人员。同时，据“共同社”报道，汉城的所谓“消息灵通人士”公开承认：李承晚和元容德叫嚣撕毁停战协定的声明，“可能是在美方的默许之下发表的”。
    但是，杜勒斯居然恬不知耻地企图把美国蓄意破坏朝鲜停战协定、阴谋取消中立国监察委员会的罪责转嫁于人。他不惜再度使用早已破了产的卑劣手段，重复什么中立国监察委员会“不起作用”，“不能在共产党北朝鲜执行正当的视察工作”等等诽谤滥调。他甚至含血喷人地诬蔑我方“明白地违反了停战协定”，然后就扬言联合国军司令部可能要“真的废除停战协定”。
    很显然，杜勒斯只是在把他自己的破坏停战协定的全部阴谋计划说到了底罢了。至于他那些不论是诽谤中立国监察委员会或是诬蔑朝中方面的陈词滥调，都早已被铁一般的事实驳得体无完肤，早已是根本站不住脚的了。
    我国周恩来外长就曾在日内瓦会议上列举不容辩驳的事实证明：“在朝鲜停战的十个月中，中立国监察委员对于协助朝鲜停战协定的实施起了它的积极作用”。“中立国监察委员会在它的工作中虽然遭遇到了若干困难，但是它的贡献和成绩是不容抹煞的。”那时，杜勒斯和其他诽谤者对这个公正论断就提不出任何反驳的意见，因为，明明白白的事实是，正是由于中立国监察委员会还能起积极的作用，并一再揭露过美方违反停战协定、非法运入增援性作战物资的事实，才使得美方对它恨之入骨，急于要把它取消。
    和过去一样，杜勒斯现在也还是没有根据地诬蔑朝中方面“违反了停战协定”而这回杜勒斯的景况显得更加不妙了，而不得不承认他“没有获得关于北朝鲜情况的详细消息”，他根据的只是什么
  “一般印象”。诬蔑者的空虚可见一斑了。
    杜勒斯一直玩弄的另一个卑劣的手腕，就是企图制造瑞士、瑞典委员的所谓“不满”和“退出这个委员会”，来达到美国破坏中立国监察委员会的目的。但是，担任监察朝鲜停战的工作是维护朝鲜和平与世界和平的一个神圣的任务，尊重这个任务的中立国是不应该上美方的圈套的。这次中立国监察委员会的四国委员，联名写信给朝鲜军事停战委员会，指控美方危害中立国监察委员会视察人员的安全的严重事件，要求美方采取有效措施保证中立国视察小组的正常工作条件。这是完全正当的。中立国监察委员会是有权责成美方立即结束目前危害中立国视察人员的暴行，保护他们的安全和工作的。瑞士代表团发言人并已断然否认美国通讯社捏造的所谓瑞士政府同意杜勒斯解散中立国监察委员会的谣言，这又一次揭露美国的卑鄙阴谋。
    全世界爱好和平的人民以及每一个愿意巩固朝鲜和平的国家，都必须警惕美方逐步瓦解直至完全破坏停战协定的阴谋计划。
    杜勒斯企图在下届联合国大会中挟持它的盟国来破坏停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的条款，是不能容许的。停战协定第六十一款中明白规定了
  “对本停战协定的修正与增补必须经敌对双方司令官相互协议”，已成为交战一方的联合国对于朝鲜停战协定的任何片面行动，都是非法的。任何国家如果追随美国进行这个阴谋活动，都将便利美国和李承晚破坏停战协定，威胁朝鲜的停战，使自己承担严重的后果。
    现在，杜勒斯已把美国“解散”中立国监察委员会的阴谋计划完全公开出来了。他想使人对他逐步实行这个计划丧失警惕，是不可能的。杜勒斯连哄带骗地说，解散中立国监察委员会并不影响停战现状。他说：停战“协定的某些部分可能已变得过时或行不通的了，这些部分可以作为无效，而并不影响整个停战协定”。但是，人们知道，美方已经破坏了
  “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，劫夺了四万八千余名朝中被俘人员；同时，它又使朝鲜政治会议不得召开，破坏了日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，现在美李华盛顿会谈又公然表明要由李承晚来“统一”朝鲜，企图堵死和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。如果中立国监察委员会又被片面取消，美方就可以放手违反停战协定，扩充南朝鲜的军事力量，准备重起战争。这都是绝对不能容许的。朝鲜停战协定是
  一个庄严的整体，它的每一条款和每一部分都必须全部实施，都不能违反，不能割裂。朝鲜停战协定第六十二款明文规定：“本停战协定各条款，在未为双方共同接受的修正与增补，或未为双方政治级和平解决的适当协定中的规定所明确代替以前，继续有效”。因此，决不能听任美方一步一步地背弃和瓦解停战协定，必须维护中立国监察委员会的工作。
    在八月三日举行的朝鲜军事停战委员会紧急会议上，美方迫于朝中方面的严正抗议和世界舆论的谴责，不得不表示愿在今后履行其对于中立国监察委员会人员和工作所已经承担的义务，给予他们以充分的保护。美方首席委员布里敦并向中立国监察委员会表示联合国军司令部要“保证设法终止”南朝鲜的恐怖行动。但是，杜勒斯所宣布的解散中立国监察委员会的阴谋计划，不禁使人怀疑美方所作的诺言有多大的价值。朝中方面以及全世界和平人民都应提高警惕，坚决反对美方破坏停战协定的任何罪行。
