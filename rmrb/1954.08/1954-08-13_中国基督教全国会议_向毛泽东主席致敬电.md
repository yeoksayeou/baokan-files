    China Christian National Conference
    Message of Respect to Chairman Mao Zedong

    Respected Chairman Mao:

    We, representing Christians from all over the country, extend our most profound respect to you!

    For over a century, Chinese Christianity was utilized by imperialism as a tool for aggression against China. In 1949, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and yourself, the people of the entire nation were liberated, and we Christians were able to break away from the control of imperialism and launch the anti-imperialist, patriotic Three-Self Patriotic Movement.

    Over the past four years, through the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, Chinese Christianity has fundamentally severed its ties with imperialism in terms of personnel, administration, and finances, and has begun to eliminate the influence of imperialism, initially achieving self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. These achievements are inseparable from your wise leadership and close concern, as well as the brilliant achievements of New China in recent years. For this, we, representing Christians from all over the country, express our deepest gratitude to you!

    Now, we are gathered in the capital, Beijing, to hold the first national conference entirely presided over by Chinese Christians ourselves, summarizing the past work of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, clarifying future directions and tasks, consolidating and expanding our unity, and establishing a formal leading body. We pledge to you: we will strengthen the great anti-imperialist patriotic unity, work together to advance the Three-Self Patriotic Movement; we firmly support the draft constitution, promote the spirit of patriotism and law-abiding, actively participate in the construction of the motherland, we will heighten our vigilance, and thwart all conspiracies of imperialism attempting to continue to use Chinese Christianity for aggression, and actively participate in the struggle for lasting world peace.

    Finally, we respectfully represent Christians from all over the country in wishing you good health!
                                              
    China Christian National Conference

    中国基督教全国会议
    向毛泽东主席致敬电敬爱的毛主席：
    我们代表全国基督徒向您致最崇高的敬礼！
    百余年来，中国基督教曾被帝国主义利用作为侵略中国的工具。一九四九年，在中国共产党和您的领导下，全国人民得到解放，我们基督徒才能摆脱帝国主义的控制，发动反帝爱国的三自运动。
    四年来，通过三自爱国运动，我们中国基督教已经在人事、行政、经济等方面基本上割断了与帝国主义的关系，开始肃清帝国主义的影响，初步实现了自治、自养、自传。这些成就与您的英明领导与亲切关怀，以及几年来新中国的辉煌成就是分不开的。为此，我们代表全国基督徒向您致最深切的感谢！
    现在，我们聚集在首都北京，举行完全由我们中国基督徒自己主持的第一次全国性的会议，总结了三自爱国运动过去的工作，明确了今后的方针任务，巩固与扩大了我们的团结，并成立了正式领导机构。我们向您提出保证：我们一定要加强反帝爱国大团结，同心协力推进三自爱国运动；我们坚决拥护宪法草案，发扬爱国守法精神，积极参加祖国建设，我们要提高警惕，粉碎帝国主义企图继续利用中国基督教进行侵略的一切阴谋，积极参加争取世界持久和平的斗争。
    最后，我们谨代表全国基督徒祝您身体健康！                                              
    中国基督教全国会议                                                           
    一九五四年八月五日
