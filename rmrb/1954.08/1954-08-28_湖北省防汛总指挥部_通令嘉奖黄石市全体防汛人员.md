Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters
    Commends All Flood Control Personnel in Huangshi City

    The Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters issued a commendation order to all flood control personnel in Huangshi City. The commendation order stated that since entering the tense stage of flood control in late June, for nearly two months, all flood control personnel, mainly composed of local People's Liberation Army troops, workers, and nearby farmers, with the strong support of relevant departments of the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country, and under the direct leadership of the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Huangshi Municipal People's Government, and the Huangshi Municipal Flood Control Headquarters, have been guarding the river embankment day and night, and have carried out a heroic and sustained struggle against the Yangtze River flood, the worst in nearly a century, and have achieved great victories. Under the slogan of "raising the dikes as the water rises," they have completed the heightening and reinforcement projects several times, generally raising the dikes to above 27 meters, and promptly consolidated the weak dike bodies, and rescued all dangerous sections, so that many serious dangers were turned into safety. Up to now, the Huangshi City dikes have successfully withstood the severe test of five floods. This is of great significance for protecting the safety of Huangshi City and ensuring the normal progress of the country's socialist economic construction. The achievements of all flood control personnel in Huangshi City in flood control and rescue are significant. The Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters hereby issues a commendation order.

    The commendation order specifically pointed out: Although the Yangtze River water level has begun to fall steadily, due to the excessive amount of water in the rivers and lakes, it is not easy for the river water to be discharged for a while. The safety of Huangshi City is still under the serious threat of high water levels, and flood control work must not be slackened in the slightest. Therefore, all flood control personnel in Huangshi City must continue to consolidate the achievements already made, further develop the revolutionary heroic spirit of hard struggle, and make persistent efforts to ensure the safety of Huangshi City and strive for the final victory of flood control work.

    湖北省防汛总指挥部
    通令嘉奖黄石市全体防汛人员
    湖北省防汛总指挥部通令嘉奖黄石市全体防汛人员。嘉奖令说，自六月下旬进入防汛的紧张阶段后，近两个月来，以人民解放军驻当地部队、工人和邻近农民为主力的全体防汛人员在中央人民政府有关部门和全国人民强有力的支援下，在中共黄石市委员会、黄石市人民政府、黄石市防汛指挥部的直接领导下，夜以继日地守卫在江堤防线上，和近百年未有的长江洪水进行了英勇而持久的斗争，已取得了巨大的胜利。在水涨堤高的口号下，几次都突击完成了加高加固工程，普遍把堤防加高到二十七公尺以上，并及时巩固了薄弱的堤身，抢护了所有险工险段，使多处严重险象得以转危为安。到目前止，黄石市堤防已胜利经过五次洪水的严重考验。这对保卫黄石市区安全和保证国家的社会主义经济建设的正常进行，具有重大意义。黄石市全体防汛人员在防汛抢险中的成绩是很大的，湖北省防汛总指挥部特此通令予以嘉奖。
    嘉奖令特别指出：目前长江水位开始稳落，但因江河湖泊水量过大，江水一时宣泄不易，黄石市区安全仍处在高水位的严重威胁下，防汛工作决不能有丝毫麻痹松懈，因此黄石市全体防汛人员要继续巩固既得成就，进一步发扬艰苦奋战的革命英雄主义精神，再接再厉，为确保黄石市安全，争取防汛工作的最后胜利而斗争。　（新华社）
