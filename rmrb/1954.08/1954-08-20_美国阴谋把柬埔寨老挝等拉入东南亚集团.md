Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: Commentator Wu Min comments: The sound of gunfire has barely ceased throughout Indochina, and the U.S. authorities are already hastily plotting to undermine the Indochina armistice agreement, desperately attempting to pull Cambodia, Laos, and Bao Dai's Vietnam into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc that is being cobbled together.

    After the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles publicly stated in speeches and secret testimonies to congressional committees that the United States would include the three Indochinese countries in the scope of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc planned by the United States, as an area "protected" by this bloc. Since then, pulling the three Indochinese countries, especially Cambodia and Laos, into the Southeast Asia bloc has become one of the central focuses of the U.S. authorities' intense activities. Experts at the U.S. State Department have been studying and looking for excuses to achieve this goal. At the same time, the United States has been colluding with countries such as Cambodia. According to Western news agencies, the United States has instigated Cambodia and Laos to send observers to attend meetings discussing the establishment of the Southeast Asia bloc. U.S. Under Secretary of State Smith has also indicated to the Cambodian Ambassador to the United States that the United States is determined to have the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc "guarantee" Cambodia's so-called "security." On August 14th, the United States issued a statement announcing that a meeting to discuss the establishment of the Southeast Asia bloc would be held in early September. Immediately afterward, U.S. news agencies greatly publicized that the three Indochinese countries "are likely" to be placed under the "protection" of the Southeast Asia bloc.

    In order to justify this blatant act of undermining the Geneva Conference agreements, U.S. officials deliberately created the argument that Cambodia and Laos could participate in the Southeast Asia bloc led by the United States without violating the agreements, attempting to deceive public opinion. At the same time, the French authorities openly circumvented the obligations they had undertaken under the Indochina armistice agreement and echoed the U.S. position, stating that "Laos and Cambodia have the right to join" the "Southeast Asia Pact."

    However, the untenability of this argument is as unforgivable as the Washington conspiracy. Broad public opinion in Asia has unanimously pointed out that the U.S. organization of this exclusive military aggressive bloc is an act of creating division, undermining peace in Asia, and threatening the security of various countries. This action taken by the U.S. authorities for its aggressive interests is undoubtedly another blatant violation of the United Nations Charter, which guarantees international cooperation, maintains peace, and ensures international security. This action is completely contrary to the interests of the peoples of Asian countries, including the peoples of Cambodia and Laos. Everyone knows that the cessation of hostilities in Indochina has provided the most basic guarantee for peace and security in the Indochinese countries, and the greatest interests of Cambodia and Laos are to ensure the faithful observance and implementation of the Indochina armistice agreements. However, the U.S. authorities are now attempting to drag them into the trap of the Southeast Asia Pact under the guise of maintaining the "security" of the two countries, forcing them to serve the adventurous policies of the United States in creating new wars.

    The sinister essence of the U.S. conspiracy is even more clearly exposed in contrast to the Indochina armistice agreements. The agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam stipulates that both parties should ensure that the areas temporarily assigned to them do not participate in any military alliances and are not used to re-ignite hostilities or for aggressive policies. The governments of Laos and Cambodia also clearly declared in their respective statements that they would "never participate in aggressive policies" and would never allow their territories "to be used to serve such policies." The governments of the two countries also agreed not to participate in military alliances that violate the principles of the United Nations Charter and the principles of the cessation of hostilities agreement. Now, the United States wants to deny and overthrow these solemn agreements that have been announced to the world, dragging Cambodia, Laos, and even Vietnam into the military aggressive bloc it has created. This is clearly a deliberate attempt to undermine the Indochina armistice agreements, which are supported and endorsed by people all over the world.

    At the end of the Geneva Conference, the issue of the three Indochinese countries not participating in any military alliances and not serving aggressive policies was the most important issue in the negotiations for the cessation of hostilities in Indochina, especially in Laos and Cambodia. Due to the U.S.'s desperate obstruction, this issue almost destroyed the hope of reaching a final agreement. It was only through the firm efforts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union that this extremely important content concerning the future of peace in Indochina was finally affirmed in the final agreement reached at the Geneva Conference. Before the agreement was reached, Britain, France, Laos, and Cambodia had also solemnly guaranteed that Laos and Cambodia would never participate in military blocs. Precisely because of this, British Foreign Secretary Eden specifically pointed out in his report to the British House of Commons on July 22nd: "None of these three countries (Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam) should allow the establishment of foreign military bases on their territories, nor should they participate in military alliances." However, the U.S. authorities have consistently conspired to undermine this issue. Washington figures have now openly admitted that the Cambodian representative's last-minute obstruction at the Geneva Conference was orchestrated by U.S. representative, Under Secretary of State Smith, who was trying to create conditions for Cambodia's entry into the Southeast Asia bloc. And after the Geneva Conference agreement was reached, the U.S. State Department still attempted to carry out this conspiracy to the end. The current series of activities in Washington is living proof.

    The U.S. authorities are so stubbornly and viciously manipulating this conspiracy, its primary purpose is to undermine peace in Indochina, to turn Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam into forward areas for the United States to carry out aggression and hostile activities, to undermine the collective cooperation of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference in guaranteeing peace in Indochina, to create unrest in Southeast Asia, and to conspire to reignite the flames of war. For the sake of peace in Indochina and the security of Asian countries, this dangerous collusion by the U.S. authorities must be resolutely stopped.

### 美国阴谋把柬埔寨老挝等拉入东南亚集团

    美国阴谋把柬埔寨老挝等拉入东南亚集团
   【新华社十八日讯】本社评论员吴敏评论：印度支那全境的炮声刚刚停息，美国当局就在急急忙忙地策划破坏印度支那停战协定，竭力企图把柬埔寨、老挝和保大越南拉进正在拼凑中的东南亚侵略集团。
    在日内瓦会议就恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议以后，美国国务卿杜勒斯就在公开发表的谈话和国会委员会的秘密作证中表示：美国将把印度支那三国划入美国策划的东南亚侵略集团的范围之内，作为由这个集团“保护”的地区。在此以后，把印度支那三国，特别是柬埔寨和老挝拉进东南亚集团，就成为美国当局紧张活动的中心之一。美国国务院的专家一直在研究寻找借口来达到这个目的的办法。同时美国和柬埔寨等国竭力勾结，据西方通讯社透露，美国已策动柬埔寨和老挝派遣观察员列席讨论成立东南亚集团的会议。美国副国务卿史密斯并已向柬埔寨驻美大使表明，美国一定要让东南亚侵略集团来“保证”柬埔寨的所谓“安全”。八月十四日，美国发表声明，宣布九月初举行讨论成立东南亚集团的会议以后，美国通讯社立即大事宣传印度支那三国“很可能”被置于东南亚集团的“保护”之下。
    为了替这种明目张胆的破坏日内瓦会议协议的行为进行狡辩，美国官方故意制造所谓柬埔寨、老挝可以参加美国主持的东南亚集团而并不违反协议的论调，企图欺骗舆论。同时，法国当局也公然规避根据印度支那停战协定所承担的义务，而附和美国的主张，表示“老挝和柬埔寨有权加入”“东南亚公约”。
    但是，这种论调的站不住脚，正如华盛顿阴谋的不可饶恕一样。亚洲广大舆论已经一致指出：美国组织这种排他性的军事侵略集团是制造分裂、破坏亚洲和平和威胁各国安全的行为。美国当局为了它的侵略利益而采取的这种行动，毫无疑问，是对于保证国际合作、维护和平和国际安全的联合国宪章的又一次粗暴的破坏。这种行动完全违反了亚洲各国人民包括柬埔寨和老挝人民的利益。谁都知道，印度支那敌对行动的停止，使印度支那各国的和平与安全有了最基本的保证，柬埔寨和老挝的最大利益就是保证忠实遵守和履行印度支那停战协定。但是美国当局现在却在维护两国“安全”的幌子下企图把它们拖进东南亚公约的陷阱，强迫它们为美国制造新战争的冒险政策服务。
    美国阴谋的罪恶实质，在印度支那停战协定的对照之下更是暴露无遗。越南停止敌对行动协定规定双方应注意使暂时划归他们的地区不参加任何军事同盟，并不得用来重新引起敌对行动或供侵略政策利用。老挝、柬埔寨政府在其各自的声明中也明白宣布“永不参与侵略政策”，并永不允许其领土
  “被利用来为此种政策服务”。两国政府并同意不参加违反联合国宪章原则和违反停止敌对行动协定原则的军事同盟。现在，美国想要抵赖和推翻这些已向全世界公布的庄严协议，把柬埔寨、老挝甚至越南国一齐拖进它一手制造的军事侵略集团，显然是蓄意破坏为全世界人民所拥护和支持的印度支那停战协定。
    在日内瓦会议末期，印度支那三国不得参加任何军事同盟、不为侵略政策服务的问题，曾是印度支那特别是老挝、柬埔寨停止敌对行动的谈判中最重要的问题。由于美国的竭力阻挠，这一问题几乎破坏了最后达成协议的希望。只是由于越南民主共和国、中国和苏联三国的坚决努力，这个有关印度支那和平前途的极其重要的内容终于在日内瓦会议最后达成的协议中肯定了下来。在达成协议之前，英、法、老挝、柬埔寨四国并曾郑重保证老挝、柬埔寨决不参加军事集团。正是因此，英国外交大臣艾登七月二十二日在英国议会下院的报告中特别指出：“这三个国家（老挝、柬埔寨和越南国）中的任何一国都不得容许在它们的领土上建立外国军事基地，也不得参加军事同盟。”但是，美国当局却在这个问题上一贯地阴谋进行破坏。华盛顿人士现在已公开承认，柬埔寨代表在日内瓦会议上最后一分钟的阻挠，是美国代表、副国务卿史密斯一手策动的，当时史密斯正是要替柬埔寨的加入东南亚集团制造条件。而在日内瓦会议的协议达成之后，美国国务院仍然企图把这一阴谋继续进行到底。华盛顿目前一系列的活动就是活生生的证明。
    美国当局如此顽固、如此恶毒地玩弄这一阴谋，它的首要目的就是要破坏印度支那和平，把老挝、柬埔寨、越南国变成美国进行侵略和敌对活动的前哨地区，破坏参加日内瓦会议各国在保证印度支那和平方面的集体合作，在东南亚制造不安，并阴谋重新燃起战火。为了印度支那和平的利益和亚洲各国安全的利益，美国当局的这种危险勾当必须坚决地加以制止。
