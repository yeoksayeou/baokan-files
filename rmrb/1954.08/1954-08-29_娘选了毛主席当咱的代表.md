Editor's Note: Comrade Jia Lanwen is a representative to the First People's Congress of Beijing Municipality, a member of the Council of the Beijing Municipal Handicraft Production United Cooperative, Director of the Council of the Municipal No. 25 Sewing Production Cooperative, and a standing committee member of the Xidan District Democratic Women's Federation. Her eldest son Zhao Guoqian, eldest daughter-in-law Xu Shangqing, brother, and nephew have all joined the Volunteer Army successively. Below is a letter she wrote to her son, Comrade Zhao Guoqian, after attending the First Session of the First People's Congress of Beijing Municipality.

My Daughter Voted for Chairman Mao to be Our Representative

Guoqian, my son:

These days, I've been thinking about so many things that I can't possibly tell you all at once. But if I don't tell you, you won't know anything, and my heart won't be at peace.

I think you already know that the First Session of the First National People's Congress of our country will be held in our capital in just over half a month. What a big event this is! For this reason, people's congresses have been held throughout the country to discuss major events in their respective regions and to elect representatives to attend the First Session of the First National People's Congress. Guoqian, you wouldn't believe it, but your mother, who was rescued from a life of bitterness, was also elected as a representative to the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, participating in the First Session of the First People's Congress of the city, sitting with representatives from all walks of life in the capital to discuss major city affairs, and also participating in the election. During the meeting, I was constantly thinking: will our great leader Chairman Mao be elected as a representative in Beijing, and will I be able to personally cast my vote for Chairman Mao! I also know that it's all the same wherever he is elected, but I always feel that it's most appropriate to elect him in the capital, and it's most glorious to be able to personally cast a vote for him. The next day, the list of candidates nominated by the city's democratic parties and people's organizations after full consultation and discussion was distributed. I immediately saw Chairman Mao's name, as well as the names of Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Comrade Zhou Enlai. My heart was pounding, and I couldn't help but shed tears of joy. From that day on, everyone was even more enthusiastic about the meeting, eagerly anticipating the arrival of the election day. On August 21st, the day everyone was waiting for arrived. The representatives all came especially early, and so did I. The ballots were pink, with the names of twenty-eight candidates neatly printed on them. The first one was our Chairman Mao, followed by Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Comrade Zhou Enlai. I carefully read it from beginning to end, and I felt that it was all in line with my wishes. I circled all their names, but I paid special attention when circling Chairman Mao's name, fearing that I might have made a mistake. Guoqian, you know how united the representatives were. All five hundred and thirty-nine representatives elected our Chairman Mao as a representative to the National People's Congress, and also elected Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Comrade Zhou Enlai! When the election supervisor read out the results of the voting, the clapping, the shouting of slogans, the music of "The East is Red"... the entire venue was like a boiling pot. That day, many representatives also went on stage to talk about their feelings when electing Chairman Mao as a representative, and each one was more heartwarming than the last. Old Lady Kou Shunyi is a city-wide agricultural labor model, about the same age as me, but her husband died a long time ago. She said: In the old society, people all called me "Widow Li". Whenever something bad happened in the village, they all said that it was done by "Widow Li". After liberation, I had a name and a surname, and I also came to manage national affairs with everyone. If I don't vote for Chairman Mao, who should I vote for! ... Isn't that what everyone thinks? As for me, if it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I wouldn't have this honor today!

Guoqian, what's more, Chairman Mao specifically came to see us on August 22nd. That day happened to be Sunday, and Zhongshan Park, where we were meeting, was more lively than ever, with a lot of tourists. Just as we were taking pictures in front of the venue, Chairman Mao suddenly arrived. Everyone applauded vigorously and shouted slogans, and many people jumped up. As soon as Chairman Mao got out of the car, he waved to everyone. The more he waved, the louder the applause and the higher the slogans. People who were close to Chairman Mao also shook hands with him. I was standing in the back, and I didn't get to shake hands with him personally, so I shook hands with Liu Dezhen, who had shaken hands with Chairman Mao, for a long time. I felt that this was also very glorious! Chairman Mao was wearing a gray uniform that day. His health was still so good, and his face was full of radiance. I felt that as long as Chairman Mao is healthy, it is a blessing for the people of the whole country. Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Comrade Zhou Enlai also came with Chairman Mao. From a distance, they both looked very spirited. I thought to myself: Premier Zhou represented the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world at Geneva for so long. After returning to Beijing, he didn't have a good rest and came to deal with national affairs again. What kind of spirit should we use to work! It's really...

The mood of all the comrades in the cooperative is the same as mine. These days, they are as happy as if they are celebrating a big event. Every night when I return to the cooperative, the comrades who haven't slept surround me and ask me to talk about the situation of the meeting. They say: You are sitting in Zhongshan Hall for the meeting, and it's like we are all sitting there! Especially when they heard the news that Chairman Mao was to be elected in Beijing, that the representatives had all elected Chairman Mao, and that we had seen Chairman Mao, the excitement was just like the scene at the meeting. The young female workers shouted and yelled, ran over to shake hands with me, and asked all sorts of questions. Some even lifted me up high, shouting: Comrade Jia Lanwen is worthy of being our representative! All departments also held several meetings to study ways to increase production and improve quality, using practical actions to welcome Chairman Mao's election as a representative. The comrades in the sewing department and the shoe department reorganized the labor organization and implemented the "division of labor and cooperation method", which reduced idle work and increased work efficiency by 4% and quality by 15%. The work efficiency of the shoe department has also increased by 15% to 30%.

On the evening of August 24th, I gave everyone a detailed account of the First Session of the Municipal People's Congress. When I said that the main task of the people of the whole country at present is to strive for the liberation of Taiwan, the members could not calm down, and they all stood up from their seats, applauding and cheering, and some even stood on benches to shout slogans. Originally, we must liberate Taiwan, and the members had long known this from reading the newspapers. However, as soon as they heard the report, everyone immediately associated it with the slogan of welcoming Chairman Mao's election. In order to liberate Taiwan, they decided to respond to the joint declaration of the democratic parties and people's organizations and further increase production and improve quality! Many young comrades also proposed that, if the motherland needs them, they are determined to sign up to directly participate in the struggle to liberate Taiwan. Family members of soldiers also plan to write letters to encourage their relatives to study hard, master modern military technology, and strive to liberate Taiwan!

Guoqian, the comrades in our cooperative do what they say. In the past, we produced a large number of clothing, shoes, military postal bags... to support you in fighting American imperialism, and we completed the tasks on time and with quality. If we fight Taiwan, we guarantee that we will not lag behind!

Your mother, Jia Lanwen (written by Wang Ting)

### 娘选了毛主席当咱的代表

专栏：寄战士

    编者按：贾兰文同志是北京市第一届人民代表大会的代表，市手工业生产联合总社理事会理事、市第二十五缝纫生产合作社理事会主任，和西单区民主妇女联合会常务委员。她的大儿子赵国谦、大儿媳妇徐尚清和弟弟、侄子都先后参加了志愿军。下面，是她参加了北京市第一届人民代表大会第一次会议后，写给儿子赵国谦同志的信。
    娘选了毛主席当咱的代表国谦儿：
    这些天来，娘的脑子想得太多了，一下子也说不完。可是不说，你一点也不会知道，娘的心也安不下来。
    我想，你早就知道了，咱们国家第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，再过半个多月就要在咱们的首都召开了。这是一件多么大的事情啊。为了这，全国各地都召开了自己的人民代表大会，来商议自己地区的大事，来选举出席第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的代表。国谦，你不会想到吧，你这个从苦水里捞出来的母亲，也当选了北京市的人民代表，参加了全市第一届人民代表大会第一次会议，和首都各界代表们坐在一块，来商量全市的大事，还参加了选举。会上娘心里老在合计着：咱们伟大的领袖毛主席是不是会在北京当选代表，自己能不能亲自投毛主席的票！娘也知道他老人家在那里当选代表都一样，可总觉得能够在首都选他最应当，能亲自投他一票，最光荣。第二天，市各民主党派和人民团体经过充分协商、讨论，提出来的候选人名单发下来了。娘头一眼就看到了毛主席的名字，还有刘少奇同志和周恩来同志。娘当时的心啊，直是扑通扑通地跳，高兴得眼泪也不由得流出来了。从那一天起，大家开会的劲头更足了，都在眼巴巴地盼望着选举的日子快点到来。八月二十一日，大伙盼望的日子来了，代表们都来得特别早，娘也是一样。选票是粉红的颜色，上面整整齐齐地印着二十八名候选人的名字，第一个就是咱们毛主席，跟着还有刘少奇同志和周恩来同志。我从头到尾仔细看了一遍，觉得都合娘的心意，都在他们的名字上圈了个圈，不过在毛主席的名字上圈圈时特别留意，恐怕划得有不合适的地方。国谦，你知道代表们的心多齐呀，五百三十九名代表全都选了咱们毛主席当全国人民代表大会的代表，也选了刘少奇同志和周恩来同志！当监选人把投票的情况念给大家听时，拍巴掌的，喊口号的，“东方红”的音乐……，整个会场就像开了水的锅。那天，很多代表还都上台谈了谈自己选毛主席当代表时的心情，一个比一个听着入耳。寇顺义老太太是全市的农业劳动模范，岁数和娘差不多，可是丈夫早就死了，她说：旧社会人家都叫我“李寡妇”，村里出了啥坏事，都说是
  “李寡妇”办的；解放后，我有了名，也有了姓，还和大家一块来管理国家大事，我不投毛主席的票，投谁的票！……谁不是这样想，就娘来说吧，要不是共产党和毛主席的领导，就甭想有今天这份荣誉！
    国谦，这还不说，八月二十二日毛主席还特意来看我们了。那天正逢礼拜天，我们开会的地方——中山公园，比那一天都热闹，游人特别多。就在我们在会场前面照像的时候，突然毛主席来了。大家都使劲地鼓掌，呼口号，很多人都跳了起来。毛主席一下汽车，就向大家招手，越招手，掌声拍得越响，口号也喊得越高。离毛主席近的人，还都和他握了手，娘站得靠后，没有够得着和他老人家亲自握手，就找和毛主席亲自握过手的刘德珍握了半天，娘觉得这样也顶光荣！毛主席这天穿着一身灰色的制服，他老人家的身体还是那么健康，满脸红光，娘觉着只要毛主席身体健康，就是全国人民的福气。和毛主席同来的，还有刘少奇同志和周恩来同志，大远看来，他们的精神都很好。娘心想：周总理代表咱全中国人民、全世界爱好和平的人民在日内瓦工作了那么长的时间，回到北京没有好好休息一下，就又来处理国家的大事，咱应该用啥精神来工作呀！真是……
    全合作社同志们的心情都和我一样，这些天来都像办大喜事一样的高兴。每天晚上我回到社里，没有睡觉的同志就把我围拢起来，叫我讲开会的情形。他们说：你在中山堂坐着开会，就和我们都坐在那里一样！特别是他们听到毛主席要在北京应选，代表们都选了毛主席和我们见了毛主席的消息后，那个欢乐劲儿，真和在大会会场的情形一模样。年轻的女工又说又叫，跑来和娘握手，问长问短，有的就把娘抬得高高的，欢呼着说：贾兰文同志真够得上咱们的代表！各个部门还都开了几次会，研究提高产量和质量的办法，用实际行动来迎接毛主席当选为代表。缝纫部和皮鞋部的同志们重新改变了劳动组织，又实行了“分工协作法”，减少了窝工现象，工作效率提高了百分之四，质量提高了百分之十五。皮鞋部的工作效率也提高了百分之十五到百分之三十。
      八月二十四日晚上，我又把市人民代表大会第一次会议的情况，详详细细地给大家说了一遍。当我说到全国人民当前的一项主要任务就是为解放台湾奋斗时，社员们怎么也安静不下来了，都从座位上站立起来鼓掌欢呼，有的还站在凳子上呼口号。本来，咱们一定要解放台湾，社员们老早就从读报中知道了，不过，一听传达，大家又马上和迎接毛主席当选的口号联在一起，为了解放台湾，决定响应各民主党派各人民团体的联合宣言，要进一步增加产量，提高质量！许多年轻的同志，还提出：假若祖国需要，决心报名去直接参加解放台湾的斗争。军人家属，还打算写信鼓励自己的亲人，好好学习，掌握现代化军事技术，为解放台湾而奋斗！
    国谦，咱们社里的同志可是说到那里，做到那里。过去，我们生产了大量服装、皮鞋、军邮袋……，来支援你们打美帝国主义，还都按时按质量完成了任务；要是打台湾，我们保证也落不了后！娘贾兰文（王庭代笔）（附图片）
    贾兰文（左起第一人）走到了印花部里，碰巧女工们正在休息。她们跑上来和贾兰文同志热情地握手，并为毛主席当选代表而欢呼。
