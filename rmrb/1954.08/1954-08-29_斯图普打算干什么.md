To create new tensions, the United States’ aggression against Taiwan is intensifying. In less than half a month, from August 8th to 22nd, eight American generals of various stripes "visited" Taiwan. These include the U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Stump, U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Pride, U.S. Seventh Fleet's Task Force 72 Commander Kivette, U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Partridge, U.S. Japan Air Defense Commander Lynn, U.S. Mariana Islands Naval Commander Murphy, U.S. Guam Air Force Bombardment Division Commander Caldera, and U.S. Army Intelligence Chief Trudeau. Just looking at this string of names of American generals, one can smell a pungent smell of gunpowder. And among these visits by American generals, Stump's activities are particularly noteworthy.

This U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander secretly arrived in Taiwan on the 16th, and then sneaked to Dachen Island, which is occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and close to mainland China, and spent a whole day there, even "using binoculars to observe mainland China." What is alarming is not only his ghostly actions in Taiwan and Dachen Island, but also his frenzied shouting after the "inspection." He said that he would use "all necessary forces under his command" to "protect" Taiwan, and in order to "protect" Taiwan, the Seventh Fleet could take "all military expedient measures." What are these "expedient measures"? When answering reporters' questions about whether the Seventh Fleet was purely defensive, Stump said: "Sometimes you have to go out and open fire." When is "sometimes"? Stump did not hide it, he said that as long as the American navy on the Chinese coast is subjected to obvious "threats," it "will open fire first without waiting for the other party to open fire first." Moreover, Stump's provocative intention is not limited to the sea. In a reply to reporters in Washington, he said arrogantly: "The security status of the Pacific has been greatly improved, and we are more capable of carrying out destructive retaliation." And it is such a crazy general who is highly valued by the American aggressive group. He not only commands the U.S. naval, land and air forces in the Pacific, but also directly commands the U.S. military aid advisory groups stationed in Taiwan, Indochina, Thailand and the Philippines from September 15th. Moreover, according to Pan Asia News Agency, Washington has ordered Stump to decide whether or not to "protect" Dachen Island, which is occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and close to mainland China. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also publicly stated on August 24th that "the nearby islands controlled by the Kuomintang are related to the defense of Taiwan." And on August 19th, after Stump's "inspection" of Dachen Island, six U.S. naval vessels invaded the sea area near Dachen Island, which is 15 miles away from the coast of Zhejiang Province, and on the same day, U.S. aircraft, in more than 40 batches, about 160 sorties, were active over the sea near Dachen Island. These facts have clearly told us that the United States intends to continue its adventurous policy of preventing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and Stump has been designated as the main culprit in this adventure!

However, we want to warn those who are still planning to invade Chinese territory and interfere in China's internal affairs that Taiwan belongs to China. This is common sense, and it is a historical fact of many centuries. And one of the fruits of the Chinese people's bloody sacrifice in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan was to return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland. Therefore, the fact that Taiwan belongs to China is not only recognized by the world, but also recognized by the United States itself. The 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation, which the United States participated in signing, clearly stipulated that Taiwan belongs to China. Even the White Paper published by the U.S. State Department in 1949 and the statement issued by former U.S. President Truman in 1950 never dared to deny this fact.

American interventionists can slap themselves in the face and overturn what they have done and said. Can the shouts and threats of Eisenhower, Dulles and Stump overturn historical facts? Can it scare away the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan? No, the Chinese people have tough bones and will never be intimidated by any imperialism. Liberating Taiwan, saving the people of Taiwan, eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, and eliminating this root of war created by the United States are the internal affairs of the Chinese people to ensure the integrity of their territorial sovereignty, and also the just action of the Chinese people to defend world peace. The liberation of Taiwan is the general trend and the desire of the people, and no one can stop it, nor can it be stopped. American adventurers, if they still have self-knowledge, should put away their adventurous plans, otherwise, the judgment of history is ruthless, it doesn't matter what kind of guy you are!

    斯图普打算干什么
    谷音
    为了制造新的紧张局势，美国侵略台湾的活动越发紧张起来了。从本月八日到二十二日不到半个月光景，就有八个美国各色各样的将军“访问”了台湾。这就是美国太平洋舰队司令斯图普，美国第七舰队司令普赖德，美国第七舰队的第七十二特遣舰队司令基维特，美国远东空军司令帕特里奇，美国驻日防空司令林恩，美国驻马里亚纳群岛海军司令墨菲，美国驻关岛空军轰炸师指挥官卡尔达拉，美国陆军情报处处长特鲁多。看着这一连串美国将军们的名字，就可以闻到一股刺人的火药味。而在这串美国将军的访问中，斯图普的活动尤其值得注意。
    这个美国太平洋舰队司令，于十六日悄悄来到台湾，接着又偷偷溜到蒋匪盘踞的靠近我国大陆的大陈岛整整活动了一天，并且“用望远镜察看中国大陆”。值得警惕的不仅是他在台湾和在大陈岛这种鬼祟的行动，而是他在“视察”之后的疯狂叫嚣。他说，他将使用“在他指挥下的一切必要力量”来“保护”台湾，为了“保护”台湾，第七舰队可以采取“一切军事上的权宜措施”。是些什么“权宜措施”呢？斯图普在回答记者问的第七舰队是否纯系防御性质时说：“有时候你得走出去开火。”所谓“有时候”是什么时候呢？斯图普并不隐讳，他说，只要中国沿海的美国海军受到明显的“威胁”时，“将先开火，而不等对方先开火。”而且斯图普挑衅的意图并不限于海上，他在华盛顿发表的一篇答记者问中狂妄地说：“太平洋的安全地位大大改善了，我们已更有能力进行摧毁性的报复。”而就是这样一位发狂的将军，却很受美国侵略集团的看重，他不但统率着美国在太平洋上的海陆空军，从九月十五日起还要直接指挥美国驻台湾、印度支那，泰国和菲律宾的军事援助顾问团，而且据泛亚社透露：美国要不要“保护”蒋匪盘踞的紧靠中国大陆的大陈岛，华盛顿已经命令由斯图普去作决定。美国国务卿杜勒斯在八月二十四日也公然说“国民党控制的附近的岛屿是跟台湾防务有关系的”。而就在斯图普“视察”大陈岛以后的八月十九日，即有美国海军军舰六艘侵入距离我国浙江海岸十五英里的大陈岛一带海面活动，同一天并有美国飞机，分四十几批，约一百六十多架次，在大陈岛附近海面上空活动。这些事实已经明明白白告诉我们，美国打算继续它阻止中国人民解放台湾的冒险政策，而斯图普就被指定在这一冒险中充当主要凶手！
    不过，我们要正告这些还在打算侵略中国领土和干涉中国内政的人们，台湾属于中国，这是常识，这是多少世纪以来的历史事实。而中国人民流血牺牲八年抗战的胜利果实之一，就是使台湾重归祖国的怀抱，因此台湾属于中国这一事实，不仅为举世所公认，也曾为美国自己所承认。美国参加签署的一九四三年的开罗宣言和一九四五年的波茨坦公告，明确规定了台湾是属于中国的。甚至一九四九年美国国务院发表的白皮书，以及一九五零年美国前总统杜鲁门发表的文告也从来都不敢否认这个事实。
    美国干涉者可以自打嘴巴，推翻自己做过的事和说过的话，难道艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯和斯图普的叫嚣和威胁能够推得翻历史事实吗？能够吓得退中国人民解放台湾的决心吗？不，中国人民是硬骨头，绝对不是任何帝国主义可以吓得倒的。解放台湾，拯救台湾人民，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，消除这个美国制造战争的祸根，这是中国人民保障自己领土主权完整的内政，也是中国人民保卫世界和平的正义行动，解放台湾这是大势所趋，人心所向，任何人都阻止不得，也阻止不了。美国冒险分子，如果还有自知之明，应该收起他的冒险计划，否则，历史的裁判是无情的，它不管你是什么家伙！
