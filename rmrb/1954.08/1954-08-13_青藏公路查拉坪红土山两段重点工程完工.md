    Key Projects Completed on the Chalaping and Hongtushan Sections of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway
    The key projects on the Chalaping and Hongtushan sections of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway under construction were completed on July 20th and 25th, respectively. Currently, the road construction workers are continuing to build south towards the Bayan Har Mountains.

    The roadbeds of the Chalaping and Hongtushan sections are 11.6 kilometers long in total, and all are in marshy areas. Except for the winter freezing period each year, the spring, summer, and autumn seasons become a stretch of puddles and mud, making it extremely difficult to create a solid roadbed and the most serious obstacle to the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

    The altitudes of Chalaping and Hongtushan are both above 4,500 meters, with thin air and cold climates. In order to ensure the health of the road construction workers and improve work efficiency, safety and health committees have been established in each construction section to study the laws of life on the plateau and prevent various diseases caused by unaccustomedness to the plateau climate, so that the average attendance rate of employees has been increased to more than 93%. The workers demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm in their labor. They fought against rain and snow, insisted on working eight hours a day, and ensured the completion of the project on schedule.

    青藏公路查拉坪红土山两段重点工程完工
    修筑中的青（海）藏（西藏）公路查拉坪和红土山重点工程，已在七月二十日和二十五日先后完工。目前，筑路工人正向巴颜喀喇山南继续修筑。
    查拉坪和红土山两段路基共长十一点六公里，全是沮洳地段。每年除冬季冰冻外，春、夏、秋三季成为一片水滩和烂泥，要成为坚实路基异常困难，是阻碍青藏公路通车最严重的地段。
    查拉坪、红土山拔海都在四千五百公尺以上，空气稀薄，气候寒冷。为了保证筑路职工的健康和提高工作效率，各工程段都成立了安全卫生委员会，研究高原生活规律，防治了各种因不习惯高原气候而产生的疾病，使职工出勤率平均提高到百分之九十三以上。职工们在劳动中发挥了高度的积极性，他们和雨雪作斗争，坚持每天工作八小时，保证了工程按期完成。　（新华社）
