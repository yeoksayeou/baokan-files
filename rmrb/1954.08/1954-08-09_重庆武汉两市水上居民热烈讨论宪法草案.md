    Chongqing and Wuhan Waterborne Residents Enthusiastically Discuss the Draft Constitution
    Along the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in Chongqing and Wuhan, waterborne residents are enthusiastically discussing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.
    The propaganda personnel of the Chongqing First and Second Jiang District Trade Unions of the Inland Waterway Transport Workers' Union have given 22 reports to the boatmen on wooden boats, with more than 4,400 people hearing the reports. Many boatmen have held group discussions. According to the characteristics of waterborne residents being mobile and scattered, many waterborne residents have held small-scale discussion meetings. Representatives attending the People's Congress of the Waterborne District of Wuhan City also seriously discussed the Draft Constitution.
    The enthusiasm of the waterborne residents in these two cities for discussing the Draft Constitution is very high. More than 200 boatmen who had just returned to Chongqing from Yichang requested the trade union to explain and report on the contents of the Draft Constitution for them as soon as they landed. Boatman Tang Shuqing traveled more than 20 miles to listen to the report. He said: "This is a matter of discussing and formulating the fundamental law of the country, I cannot but participate!" Some boatmen on ships that are sailing also used their downtime to conduct discussions. All the representatives attending the People's Congress of the Waterborne District of Wuhan City recalled the facts that they had suffered from the oppression and bullying of the feudal gangs on the docks in the old society during the heated discussions. They also excitedly talked about the fact that after liberation, the People's Government helped the boat people to carry out democratic reforms and organize mutual aid and cooperation, so the transportation business gradually prospered and the lives of the boat people gradually improved; the representatives also talked about the so-called "democracy," "welfare," and "law" in the old society, which were all tricks of the ruling class to deceive the people. They believed that only the people's constitution is truly democratic, and compared with the old society, it is really a world of difference. An old boatman named Yang Wenguang from Chongqing, who has been boating for 41 years, said: In the past, when the reactionaries ruled, we waterborne people did not even have a place to eat or sleep. In the few years since liberation, the People's Government has helped us boatmen set up medical stations, dormitories, canteens, and clubs. Many of the provisions in the Draft Constitution are truly facts that I have personally experienced.
    In the discussion, the waterborne people in the two cities unanimously expressed that they would modelly abide by the constitution that will be officially promulgated in the future. The representatives who attended the People's Congress of the Waterborne District of Wuhan City all said that the people's representatives should take the lead in studying the Draft Constitution, deeply publicize it to the masses, and take the lead in implementing and abiding by the Constitution in the future. After studying the Draft Constitution, Jiang Shaorong, a boatman from Chongqing, strengthened his concept of cherishing public property. Once, he bravely jumped into the river to rescue a state-owned factory's barge from the danger of hitting a reef with the help of other boatmen on the shore, and was enthusiastically praised by the boatmen.

### 重庆武汉两市水上居民热烈讨论宪法草案

    重庆武汉两市水上居民热烈讨论宪法草案
    重庆、武汉两市沿长江、嘉陵江两岸的水上居民，热烈讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    内河航运工会重庆市第一、第二江区工会的宣传人员已向木船的桡工作了二十二次报告，听到报告的有四千四百多人。许多桡工分组进行了讨论。根据水上居民流动性大又分散的情况，许多水上居民举行了小型的讨论会。参加武汉市水上区人民代表大会会议的代表，也认真地对宪法草案进行了讨论。
    这两个城市的水上居民讨论宪法草案的热情很高。最近刚由宜昌回到重庆的二百多名桡工，一上岸就要求工会请人为他们讲解和报告宪法草案的内容。桡工工人唐树清从二十多里路以外赶来听报告。他说：“这是讨论制定国家根本大法的事，我不能不参加！”有些正在航行中的船上的桡工也利用停航时间进行讨论。参加武汉市水上区人民代表大会会议的全体代表在热烈的讨论中都联想到在旧社会时，受尽码头上的封建帮会压迫欺凌的事实，他们也兴奋地谈到解放后人民政府帮助船民进行民主改革，组织互助合作，因而运输业务逐渐繁荣，船民生活日渐好转的情景；代表们还谈到旧社会所谓“民主”、“福利”、“法律”等，都是统治阶级欺骗人民的花招，他们认为只有人民的宪法才是真正民主的，和旧社会相比，真是天上地下的差别。撑了四十一年船的重庆市一位老船工杨文光说：过去反动派统治时，我们水上人民连吃饭、睡觉都没有一个地方。解放几年来，人民政府帮助我们桡工设置了医疗站、宿舍、饭堂和俱乐部。宪法草案上的很多规定，都真正是我亲身经历的事实。
    在讨论中，两个城市的水上人民一致表示要模范地遵守将来正式颁布的宪法。参加武汉市水上区人民代表大会会议的代表们都表示：人民代表要带头学习宪法草案，深入地向群众宣传，将来要带头执行和遵守宪法。重庆市桡工姜绍荣在学习宪法草案后，加强了爱护公共财产的观念。有一次，他奋勇跳入江中进行抢救，在岸上其他桡工的帮助下，使一只国营工厂的驳船，免于碰礁的危险，受到船工们的热烈赞扬。　（新华社）
