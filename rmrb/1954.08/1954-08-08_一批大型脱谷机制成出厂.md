    A Batch of Large-Scale Threshers Manufactured and Shipped
    Since the local state-owned Jiamusi Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced the first large-scale thresher in March this year, it has continuously received letters from farmers in various regions expressing their gratitude for the successful trial production and requesting mass production. To meet the needs of farmers, the factory began manufacturing the first batch (20 units) of large-scale threshers in May. During the manufacturing process, the workers demonstrated their creativity, with 83 technical innovations emerging. By July 24, the threshers, composed of 10,600 parts, were being assembled one after another. This batch of machines has now been successively transported to rural areas to support farmers in their wheat threshing work. Currently, the factory has already started manufacturing the second batch of threshers.
