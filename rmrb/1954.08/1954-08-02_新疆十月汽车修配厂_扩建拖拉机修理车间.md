    Xinjiang October Auto Repair Factory
    Expands Tractor Repair Workshop
    The expansion project of the tractor repair workshop at the Xinjiang October Auto Repair Factory officially commenced on July 1st. Soviet tractor repair experts Morozov and Karalev are directly leading this project.
    The workshop building and its internal machinery and equipment will be designed and installed entirely according to Soviet standards. Machine tools such as lathes, planers, and milling machines are all newly produced electric machines from the Soviet Union. Disassembling tractors or washing tractor parts will be done using electricity and machinery. The internal auxiliary facilities of the workshop are also complete, with ventilation and heating equipment, as well as changing rooms and living quarters.
    The tractor repair workshop will adopt the advanced Soviet "assembly line repair method" for repairing tractors. Tractors that have undergone major repairs can run for three thousand to four thousand hours. The establishment of this tractor repair workshop will not only solve the current tractor repair problems in Xinjiang Province but will also play a promoting role in the gradual collectivization and mechanization of agricultural production in the future.

    新疆十月汽车修配厂
    扩建拖拉机修理车间
    新疆十月汽车修配厂扩建拖拉机修理车间的工程，已于七月一日全面开工。苏联拖拉机修理专家莫洛佐夫和卡拉辽夫，具体领导这一工程。
    这个拖拉机修理车间的工房及工房内部的机器设备，将完全根据苏联的式样标准来设计和安装，车床、刨床、洗床等机器设备都是苏联新出产的电动机器。拆卸拖拉机或是洗刷拖拉机的零件等工作，都是用电力和机械来操作。工房内部的附属设备也是完善的，有通风和暖气设备，还有更衣室、生活间等。
    这个拖拉机修理车间修理拖拉机的方法将采取苏联先进的“组件流水修理法”，大修后的拖拉机可以行驶三千至四千个小时。这一个拖拉机修理车间的建立，不但可以解决目前新疆省现有拖拉机的修理问题，对今后农业生产的逐步走向合作化和机械化也将起推动作用。
