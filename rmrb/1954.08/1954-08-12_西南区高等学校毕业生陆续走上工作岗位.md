    Southwest China's university graduates are successively taking up their work positions. This year, there are more than 4,400 graduates from universities in the Southwest region. Among them, over 1,200 are engineering graduates. Before taking up their work positions, students from various universities submitted guarantees and letters of determination, expressing their willingness to accept assignments and dedicate themselves to their work. More than 1,000 of them have been transferred to industrial, mining, transportation, and enterprise departments, and another 600-plus students have been assigned as teaching assistants and graduate students in universities. To meet the needs of the development of production, culture, and education in minority areas, many students (including graduates from minority universities) will also be transferred to work in minority areas. Among them, more than 20 graduates have been transferred to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    Currently, some graduates from Chongqing University, Southwest Art College, and Southwest Russian Language College have successively left school and are heading to their work positions. Students from other schools are also about to leave school. Reception stations for passing graduates have been set up in Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Yichang, and other places to help them solve problems such as transportation and accommodation.

    西南区一部分高等学校毕业生陆续走上工作岗位。今年，西南区各高等学校毕业生有四千四百多名。其中一千二百多人是工科毕业生。各校学生在走上工作岗位以前，纷纷提出保证和决心书，表示愿意服从分配，安心工作。他们被调到工矿交通企业部门的有一千多名，另有六百多名学生被调作高等学校助教和研究生。为适应少数民族生产和文化教育事业发展的需要，还有许多学生（包括少数民族大学毕业生）将被调到少数民族地区工作。其中，调到内蒙古自治区的毕业生有二十多名。
    目前，重庆大学、西南美术专科学校、西南俄文专科学校的部分毕业生已陆续离校，走向工作岗位，其他各校学生，也都即将离校。重庆、成都、贵阳、宜昌等地已设立过往毕业生的接待站，帮助他们解决交通工具和食宿等问题。
