    A Day and Night in the Qaidam Basin
    Wang Jiqing
    An Honorable Mission
    On May 27th, five of us comrades accepted an honorable mission: to find the contact relationship between the Tertiary Gansu System and the Mesozoic Jurassic-Cretaceous strata. Besides myself, there was a young technician, Comrade Wang Fulin, 24 years old; two People's Liberation Army comrades, Squad Leader He and Comrade Li; and an experienced truck driver, Comrade Lao Gao.
    The Qaidam Basin has a purely continental climate. In late May, the water in the tanks still froze overnight. That morning, the comrades were awakened by a rumbling sound; it was Lao Gao starting the engine. Half an hour later, we set off. The car quickly entered the basin, carrying us and speeding along the rugged highway.
    Geological workers cannot rely entirely on roads. Fifteen minutes later, we were walking on the Gobi Desert.
    "Fallen into an Oil Tank"
    Singing and chatting, we entered a large gully.
    "Hey! Isn't this oil sand?" Fulin held a large, dark, shiny piece of oil sand, which looked to weigh five or six pounds, smiling triumphantly.
    Suddenly, Squad Leader He ran back the way we had come. He had noticed this kind of thing in the riverbed before, but didn't know what oil embedded in stone looked like. Now he understood! Ten minutes later, he also held a large piece of oil sand.
    We were about to finish tracing the Tertiary strata, and were about to see the contact relationship with the Mesozoic strata, but the strata changed in the opposite direction, so we had to cross the mountain to find the older strata!
    The steepness of the mountain didn't matter, but the loose soil was deadly. We climbed one step and slid back half a step. If we weren't careful, we'd take the "elevator" and slide down the mountain. The rising dust almost suffocated us. But none of us complained, because this was our country's wealth, formed by the weathering of oil sand.
    With each handhold and footstep, an intoxicating oil fragrance arose. There was oil on the mountain, oil below the mountain, oil in the gully, and oil outside the gully. Lao Li couldn't help but shout, "We've practically fallen into an oil tank!"
    Climbing to the top of the mountain, 3,800 meters above sea level, we felt very relaxed; but unexpectedly, a panoramic view revealed another intact oil storage structure, completely undamaged. Immediately, the four of us held a "carnival" on the mountaintop, jumping and shouting wildly for a while before calmly sitting down. We counted on our fingers for a while. Since arriving in the basin, we had already discovered several structures. "I say, Lao Wang, let's have our Qaidam Brigade take over the structures that the Petroleum Exploration Five-Year Plan needs to find!" I said, half-jokingly, half-excitedly.
      Continuing Forward
    Everyone was eager to find a way to find the contact relationship. We held a "geological meeting" on the spot and decided to continue north.
      For a petroleum exploration team member, discovering a structure or an oil layer is like a worker in a factory finding a trick after great effort, or a scientist discovering
  a law. However, at this moment, we had to temporarily restrain this joy. Anyway, this structure wasn't going anywhere, and it was more important to find the contact relationship of the strata as soon as possible. Thinking of this, we took the "elevator" and slid down the mountain, then continued forward along the gully!
    Nature often creates various difficulties for people. We were disappointed in this area regarding the search for the contact relationship of the strata. By this time, it was already past three in the afternoon, and we should have called it a day.
    Leaving the gully, we faced the setting sun, braved the northwest wind, and dragged our tired steps back.
    Geological workers usually have this shortcoming: when they make a major discovery in their work, they neglect other issues. On the way back, we realized that all four of our water bottles were empty. We were walking on the Gobi Desert, which was covered with sand and pebbles, going up gentle slopes, against the wind, progressing very slowly, especially since we were carrying guns, ammunition, and rocks!
    Our legs became more and more tired, and our mouths became drier and drier. Gradually, the comrades couldn't hold on any longer. We started by resting every half kilometer, then every four hundred meters, then three hundred meters, two hundred meters, and finally even maintaining a distance of one hundred meters became difficult.
    After a whole day of traversing mountains and ridges, coupled with thirst, we were extremely exhausted. Only seven or eight kilometers away, we didn't reach the foot of the mountain until dark.
    There was no moon in the sky, the cold wind pierced our cotton clothes, our feet were blistered, our mouths were as dry as fire, our tongues lost sensation, our lips became numb, and our whole bodies felt like we had just recovered from a major illness, with no strength at all. Climbing the mountain, our legs were weak. There was no road, only gullies, and we couldn't see home. Mountain after mountain, gully after gully, how could we get home? But in order to complete the mission given to us by the people—to find oil—we had to go back! We had to go back! Strong will generated tenacious strength, and nothing could stop us!
    Test
    Due to excessive thirst, Fulin became dizzy and fell down. Five minutes later, under the faint starlight, he勉强睁开
  a pair of bloodshot eyes. Then, he exerted his greatest effort to stand up and staggered forward again!
    "Fulin, how are you? How do you feel?"
    "It's nothing. I haven't forgotten the director's kind instructions: The team going to Qaidam should be a team of heroes, capable of withstanding any test. Today is just the beginning of the test!"
    It was already past two in the morning. We crossed one mountain after another; climbed one gully after another, as if we could never escape their clutches. To be honest, I really didn't know when we would get home. Therefore, I had to plan for "just in case," so I told the comrades, "We should save our urine. If we still can't find our way home tomorrow, we won't die of thirst out here!"
    When I got up to move forward again, the water in my kettle rattled. The sound was pleasing to the ear, and it relaxed my tense mood.
    I scouted the way ahead. When several deep gullies surrounded me, leaving me temporarily at a loss, I had to rest for a while, sitting on the hillside.
    I could no longer suppress the thirst. "Drink some urine!" The thought suddenly crossed my mind. "Who knows what urine tastes like? Endure it for a while longer, and maybe we can find our way home!" After many ideological struggles, I finally decided to take a sip. No matter how unpleasant the urine was, I immediately felt more comfortable after drinking it.
      Enthusiastic Handshake
    It was already past four in the morning of the next day, and we were still sitting on the mountaintop, gazing south in a daze, still seeing layers upon layers of mountains. Okay! Even if you are thousands of mountains and tens of thousands of mountains, you cannot frighten young exploration team members! If we don't cross you, we are not heroes. "Go!" Fulin shouted as usual, and four dark shadows began to move again.
    Strange! Why is it always downhill? Why are the peaks on the opposite side still so far away?
      "Haha! We've found the Gobi Desert! We've come down the mountain!"
      "Really? Who says it isn't?"
    Ah! We finally found this terrible and lovely Gobi Desert. Following the direction indicated by the nocturnal compass, we walked southwest with heavy steps and a happy mood. Half an hour later, we found the highway. Of course, the car must have returned. Next to the parking place, there was a large pile of ashes, which was the direction home that the driver Lao Gao gave us.
    The east was already dawning, and we walked slowly. The sun had already risen, and we were still walking slowly. The fifteen-minute car ride on the way there took us a full four hours to walk before we saw the tops of the tents.
    At 7:50, we finally returned safely to our warm home in the field. Everyone fell down. At this time, the geologist and the young exploration team members surrounded us, shaking our hands enthusiastically and offering kind words of comfort.
    On the morning of the third day, we started working again, full of energy.

    柴达木盆地一昼夜
    王吉庆
    一个光荣的任务
    五月二十七日，我们五个同志接受了一个光荣的任务，去寻找第三纪甘肃系和中生代侏罗白垩纪的地层接触关系。我们五个同志里面，除了我以外，有一位二十四岁的年轻技术员王福林同志；还有两位是解放军同志：何班长和李同志；另外一个是技术熟练的汽车司机老高同志。
    柴达木盆地里，纯属大陆性气候。五月末的早上，缸里的水仍然要结冰。这一天清早，同志们被隆隆声惊醒了，原来老高正在发动车子。半个钟头以后，我们就出发了。小汽车迅速地进了盆地，载着我们奔驰在崎岖的公路上。
    地质工作者是不能完全依靠公路的，十五分钟后，我们徒步在戈壁滩上了。
    “掉在油罐里了”
    我们歌唱着、谈笑着进了大山沟。
    “咦！这不是油砂吗？”福林手里捧着一大块黑黝黝的油砂，看样子足有五、六斤重，很得意地笑着。
    忽然何班长朝原路跑回去了。他早就发现了河床有这种东西，但是不知道长在石头里的石油是个什么样子，这下子可明白了！十分钟后，他手里也捧了一大块油砂。
    眼看着将第三纪的地层快追完，再走上一段就可以见到和中生代地层的接触关系了，可是偏偏地层改变了一个相反的倾向，我们只好翻过山找老地层去！
    山陡不要紧，土松真要命。爬一步滑半步，一不小心，就要坐“电梯”，滑下山去。飞起的尘土，几乎使人窒息。但是我们没有人埋怨，因为这是我们国家的财富，是油砂风化而成的。
    手一爬，脚一踢，飘起了醉人的油香。山上也是油，山下也是油，沟里也是油，沟外也是油，老李情不自禁地大喊了一声：“咱们这简直是掉在油罐里了！”
    爬上了高达海拔三千八百公尺的山顶，心里很轻松；可是意外的，登高一望，这里又是一个完好的储油构造，一点未受破坏。立刻，四个人在山头上举行了一个“狂欢大会”，乱跳、乱叫半天，才安静地坐下来。我们扳着手指算了一阵，到盆地以来，我们已经发现好几个构造了。“我说老王，咱们石油探勘五年计划所要找到的构造，让咱们柴达木大队包干算了！”我这样半开玩笑、半兴奋地说。
      继续前进
    大家都急着想办法，到那里去找接触关系呢？我们就地召开了一次“地质会议”，决定继续往北去。
      一个石油探勘队员，一旦发现了构造或是油层，就好像是一个工厂里的工人，费了很大的努力找到一个窍门，或者是一个科学工作者发明了
  一条定律一样高兴。不过，此刻我们只得暂时收敛起这种喜悦，反正这个构造是跑不掉的，还是赶快找地层的接触关系要紧。想到这里，我们坐着“电梯”，滑下山去，然后沿沟继续前进了！
    大自然常常给人们造成各种各样的困难，关于寻找地层的接触关系，在这一带地方，我们是失望了。这个时候已经是午后三点多钟，应该收工了。
    出了山沟，我们朝着西下的太阳，迎着西北风，拖着疲倦的步子，往回走了。
    地质工作者们通常都有这么一个缺点：在工作中有了重大发现时，就忽略了旁的问题。往回走的路上，才发现四个人的水壶都已经干了。我们行走在布满砂土和卵石的戈壁滩上，上缓坡，迎风，行进得非常迟慢，何况身上还背着枪枝、弹药和石头呢？
    两条腿越走越累，嘴里越来越干，渐渐地同志们支持不住了。开始是每半公里休息一次，继而四百公尺休息一次，三百公尺，二百公尺，最后连一百公尺的距离都难维持了。
    整天的翻山越岭，再加上干渴，疲乏极了。只有七、八公里的路程，一直走到天黑才到山边上。
    天上没有月亮，寒风刺穿了棉衣，脚磨起了水泡，口里干得像火烧，舌头失去了知觉，嘴唇变得麻木，浑身就好像生过一场大病刚起来似的，一点气力都没有，爬起山来两条腿直发软。没有路只是沟，也看不到家。山连着山，沟接着沟，怎么能回到家呢？但是，为了要完成人民给予的使命——找出油来，回去！一定得回去！坚强的意志，产生了顽强的力量，什么也阻挡不住我们了！
    考验
    由于干渴过度，福林的头发昏了，倒了下去。五分钟后，在闪闪的微弱星光下，他勉强的睁开了
  一双通红的眼睛。然后，尽了最大的努力站了起来，摇摇晃晃地又前进了！
    “福林，怎么样？有什么感觉？”
    “没有什么，我并没有忘记局长的亲切嘱咐：去柴达木的队伍，应当是英雄的队伍，要经受得起任何考验，今天不过是考验的开始！”
    已经是午夜两点多了，翻了一座山，又是一座山；爬了一条沟，又是一条沟，就仿佛总也逃不出它们的魔掌似的。说真的，什么时候能回到家里？我心中实在是没有底，因此，不得不作“万一”的打算，于是我告诉同志们：“我们应当将小便保存起来，如果明天还找不到家，也不致于渴死在外头”！
    再爬起来前进时，我的水壶内稀里哗啦响起来了，这声音听起来很悦耳，它使人紧张的心情松弛了一下。
    我在前面探路。当几条深沟将我包围起来，使我一时束手无策时，只好暂时休息一下，坐在山坡上。
    干渴再也压制不住了，“喝一口尿吧！”这种念头突然掠过，“谁知道尿是什么味道？再熬一段时间，说不定就可以找到家了！”经过了多次的思想斗争，终于下定了决心喝上一口。不管尿是多么难喝，但喝后顿时感到舒畅了一些。
      热烈的握手
    已经是次日四点多钟了，我们仍然呆坐在山头上，矇眬中朝南一眼望去，依然是重重的山峦。好吧！你就是千重山万重山，也吓不倒年轻的探勘队员！不翻过你去，不算英雄汉，“走！”福林照例呐喊了一声，四个黑影又开始移动了。
    奇怪！为什么一直是缓下坡？对面的山峰为什么还是这么远？
      “哈哈！咱们找到戈壁滩了，已经下了山了！”
      “真的吗？谁说不是？”
    啊！总算是找到了这可怕又可爱的戈壁滩了。顺着夜光罗盘的指示，我们脚步沉重而心情愉快地朝着西南走去了，半小时后找到了公路。自然汽车是应该回去了，在停车地方的旁边，留下了一大堆灰烬，这是司机老高给我们指示的回家的方向。
    东方已经发白了，我们慢慢地走着，太阳已经升起了，我们还是慢慢地走着。来时十五分钟的汽车路程足足走了四个小时，才看见了帐篷顶。
    七点五十分，我们终于平安地回到野外的温暖之家。一个个都倒下去了。这时，地质师和年青的勘探队员们把我们围起来，热烈的握手，亲切的慰问。
    第三天清晨，我们又精神饱满地开始工作了。
