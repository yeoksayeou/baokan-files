    The Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory is under tense construction. The No. 2 factory building, originally scheduled to start construction next year, also began construction ahead of schedule on August 11th.
    The main projects that started construction at the Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory this year include the No. 1 factory building, the No. 3 factory building, the boiler room, and the flammable goods warehouse. Since the start of these projects in April this year, they have conscientiously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, promoted advanced experiences such as parallel flow operation methods, mortar masonry methods, electrothermal thawing methods, and electrothermal concrete drying methods. The projects have progressed rapidly in the past few months. Currently, the bricklaying tasks of these projects are nearing completion, and the steel roof frames have also been hoisted. Among them, the No. 3 factory building will be basically completed by the end of this month.
    In order to hand over this modern factory for production as soon as possible, the construction workers have enthusiastically launched a labor competition centered on technological innovation. Reinforcing bar worker Teng Xuechang and technician Wang Mengcai jointly developed a reinforcing bar cutting machine, and tinsmith Ji Huachun successfully developed tools such as a "flat steel flange bending disc," all of which improved efficiency by more than double compared to manual operation.

    哈尔滨电表仪器厂在紧张建设中
    哈尔滨电表仪器厂工程正在紧张建设中。计划在明年开工的第二号厂房，也已在八月十一日提前开工了。
    哈尔滨电表仪器厂今年开工的有第一号厂房、第三号厂房、锅炉房和易燃品仓库等主要工程。这些工程在今年四月开工以后，认真贯彻了苏联专家建议，推行了平行流水作业法、坐浆砌石法、电热化冻法和电热混凝土干燥法等先进经验，几个月来工程进展迅速。目前这些工程的砌砖任务已接近完工，钢房架子也已吊装完毕，其中第三厂房将于本月底基本竣工。
    建筑工人们为使这座近代化的工厂早日移交生产，热烈地开展了以技术革新为内容的劳动竞赛。铁筋工滕学昌和技术员王孟才共同研究成功了钢筋切断机，白铁工纪华春研究成功了“扁钢法兰弯曲盘”等工具，都比手工操作提高效率一倍多。
