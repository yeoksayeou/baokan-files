Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 15th: Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, issued an order to all officers and men of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Korean People's Army on the occasion of the ninth anniversary of the liberation of Korea on "August 15th."

    In the order, Marshal Kim Il-sung first extended warm congratulations to the officers and men of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Korean People's Army and the Korean people on the ninth anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

    The order pointed out: The Korean people have achieved a great victory in the Fatherland Liberation War and are now unanimously rising up to engage in a solemn labor struggle to complete the Three-Year Plan for post-war people's economic recovery and development for the peace, reunification, independence, and strengthening of the democratic base of their country.

    The order said: The great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries continue to provide the Korean people with enormous material and technical assistance. Now, all the destroyed cities, factories, and manufacturing plants in the northern half of the Republic are being cleared and restored, many large factories and enterprises have fully started production, the rural economy is rapidly recovering and developing, and people's lives are improving and rising day by day. However, the southern half of our country, due to the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang's crazy war policies and plundering policies, is turning into a more hungry, poor, and suppression-filled, slaughterous hell on earth. The dissatisfaction and resistance of the people in the southern half towards the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang are becoming more and more intense. They place great hopes on the achievements of the people in the northern half of the Republic in their struggle for the peaceful reunification and recovery of the country.

    The order then pointed out: Recently, the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang's sinister conspiracies to sabotage the Korean Armistice and provoke a new war have become even more blatant. However, their any aggressive ambitions will not be realized. The powerful strength of all the united Korean people will be able to consolidate the victory of the armistice, defend the peaceful construction of our people, and will surely achieve the peaceful reunification of the country.

    The order called on all officers and men of the People's Army to further raise their revolutionary vigilance, strengthen the country's defenses, and closely monitor the enemy's every move, so that in the event the enemy launches a perfidious invasion, they can annihilate the enemy with a decisive counterattack. The order also called on all officers and men of the People's Army to further strengthen the combat friendship and friendly unity with the commanders and fighters of the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, cherish and master their weapons and combat equipment, and strengthen military discipline and order within the troops a hundredfold, so that the People's Army becomes an army with invincible combat power and a high level of ability.

    The order concluded: On the occasion of the ninth anniversary of "August 15th," when our country was liberated thanks to the great Soviet army, I order:

    Today, August 15th, at 21:00 hours, in the democratic capital of our country – Pyongyang, one hundred and twenty artillery pieces will simultaneously fire twenty-four volleys.

    Long live the ninth anniversary of the Great Soviet Army liberating Korea!

    Long live the fortress of world peace and security, the liberator and true helper of the Korean people – the great Soviet Union and the heroic Soviet Army!

    Long live the eternal friendship and unity between the peoples of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the people's democratic countries, and the Korean people!

    Long live the unified and independent Korean people!

    Long live the heroic Korean People's Army!

    Long live the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers!

    Eternal glory to the heroes who sacrificed in the sacred war for the freedom and independence of our country!

    Long live the leading and guiding force of the Korean people – the Korean Workers' Party!

    Long live our glorious motherland – the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

    庆祝“八·一五”朝鲜解放九周年纪念日
    金日成元帅向全军将士发布命令
   【新华社平壤十五日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅在“八·一五”朝鲜解放九周年纪念日向朝鲜人民军陆、海、空军全体将士发布命令。
    金日成元帅在命令中首先向朝鲜人民军陆、海、空军将士和朝鲜人民热烈祝贺朝鲜解放九周年。
    命令指出：朝鲜人民在祖国解放战争中取得了伟大的胜利，今天正在一致奋起进行庄严的劳动斗争，争取完成为自己祖国的和平、统一、独立和加强民主基地而进行的战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划。
    命令说：伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家继续给予朝鲜人民以巨大的物质和技术援助。现在，共和国北半部所有被破坏的城市和工厂、制造所都在清理和恢复着，很多大工厂企业已经全面开工生产，农村经济正在迅速恢复和发展，人民生活正在日益改善和提高。但是，我们祖国的南半部却由于美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮疯狂的战争政策和掠夺政策，而在变为更加饥饿、贫穷和充满着镇压、屠杀的人间地狱。南半部人民对美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的不满和反抗越来越激烈。他们对于共和国北半部人民在为祖国的和平统一和恢复建设的斗争中获得的成就寄予巨大的期望。
    命令接着指出：最近，美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮阴谋破坏朝鲜停战和挑拨新战争的凶恶阴谋活动，更加露骨。但是，它们的任何侵略野心都是实现不了的。我们全体朝鲜人民团结起来的强大力量，将能巩固停战的胜利，保卫我们人民的和平建设，也必将实现祖国的和平统一。
    命令号召人民军全体将士更加提高革命警惕性，加强祖国的防线，严密地监视敌人的一举一动，以便在一旦敌人发动背信弃义的侵犯时，能以决定性的回击来消灭敌人。命令又号召人民军全体将士进一步加强和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员的战斗友谊和友好团结，爱护和掌握自己的武器和战斗器材，百倍地加强部队内的军事纪律和秩序，使人民军成为具有无敌的战斗力和高度水平的军队。
    命令最后说：值此由于伟大的苏联军队而使我们祖国获得解放的“八·一五”九周年之际，我命令：
    今天，八月十五日二十一时，在我们祖国的民主首都——平壤，以一百二十门礼炮同时鸣放二十四响。
    伟大的苏联军队解放朝鲜九周年万岁！
    世界和平与安全的堡垒、朝鲜人民的解放者和真正的援助者——伟大的苏联和英雄的苏联军队万岁！
    苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家的人民和朝鲜人民之间的永恒的友谊团结万岁！
    统一、独立的朝鲜人民万岁！
    英雄的朝鲜人民军万岁！
    英雄的中国人民志愿军万岁！
    在为我们祖国的自由和独立的神圣战争中牺牲的勇士们永垂不朽！
    朝鲜人民领导和主导的力量——朝鲜劳动党万岁！
    我们光荣的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
