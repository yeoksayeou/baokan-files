Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 9th. The "Resolution on Struggling to Exceed the Production of 2 Billion Jin of Grain" issued by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on July 20th has been warmly supported by farmers throughout the province. According to statistics, the new production increase plans formulated by farmers in six special zones throughout the province after tapping potential and finding methods not only guarantee the completion of the plan to exceed the production of 2 billion jin of grain, but also exceed the excess production plan by 24.5 percent. In areas where early rice has been harvested, farmers are busy plowing fields, applying fertilizer, and preparing to transplant rice seedlings, striving for another harvest. In areas along the Yangtze and Han rivers and the Jianghan Plain that have not been affected by flooding, farmers are strengthening field management of the nearly ripe middle rice and the cotton that has already formed bolls, striving for a bumper harvest. The vast majority of rice along the Yangtze River that was blown down by wind and rain has been propped up. Farmers in various places are also working hard to collect fertilizer for late autumn crops. More than 70 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 6,000 year-round mutual aid groups in Xishui County are striving to apply 50 to 70 dan of fertilizer per mu of autumn-sown land. In areas affected by waterlogging, farmers are working with tenacious spirit to drain water and strive to restore production and plant late autumn crops. Under the leadership of the Macheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, farmers in Macheng County launched a large-scale movement to drain waterlogged land, restore autumn planting, and urgently weed and protect cotton. Now, most of the waterlogged fields in Macheng County have been drained; the weeds in the cotton fields have also been basically removed.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 7th. People in the water-affected areas around Dongting Lake in Hunan Province have fully launched a production self-salvation movement. Disaster areas have established production relief committees, and special offices have been established above the county level to lead the disaster-stricken people in production self-salvation. Since mid-July, special districts and counties have held production relief work conferences and formulated action plans. In agriculture, the first priority is to seize the season to plant late rice. At present, paddy fields that have receded and those at higher altitudes are preparing to plant late rice and miscellaneous grains. According to the season in Hunan Province, sowing can still be done in mid-August. Therefore, some areas are blocking breaches and draining waterlogged land, rushing to plant late rice. For example, in Wangcheng County, in the collapsed embankments that are half mountain and half water, the flow of water at the breaches is not urgent, and there are currently fifteen embankments being blocked and drained. The second is to organize disaster victims to reclaim wasteland in mountainous and hilly areas. Xiangyin County plans to reclaim about 20,000 mu, and stipulates that it should be carried out on slopes of less than 25 degrees, under the conditions of maintaining soil and water conservation and protecting forests. The seed problem has been solved thanks to the strong support of the people's government and the mutual exchange and adjustment of the masses. The slogan put forward by the farmers is: "Losses in the fields must be compensated by the soil." In terms of sideline production, the main thing is fishing. The flood has brought a large number of fish, and now various places are actively mobilizing and organizing disaster victims to fish. According to the experience of the masses, 400,000 jin of fish can be produced in a dyke with more than 60,000 mu of fields. Daming Lake Township in Wangcheng County recently estimated that more than 20,000 jin of fish can be produced in more than 4,000 mu of fields in the entire dyke. Xiangyin County has organized more than 2,100 people to fish collectively. The income from one person fishing can support more than four people. The slogan put forward by everyone is: "Losses in the water must be compensated by the water." Secondly, weaving straw sandals, hats, twisting ropes, and knitting nets can also solve the livelihood problems of some disaster victims.

    努力争取完成农业生产计划
    湖北六个专区保证超额增产二十亿斤粮食
    【新华社武汉九日电】七月二十日中共湖北省委员会发布的“关于为超额完成增产二十亿斤粮食而斗争的决议”，受到全省农民的热烈拥护。据统计，全省六个专区的农民经过挖潜力、找窍门制订的新的增产计划，不仅保证超额完成增产二十亿斤粮食的计划，而且超过了超额增产计划的百分之二十四点五。早稻收割完毕的地区，农民们正忙着犁田、下肥，准备插稻，争取多收一季。长江、汉水两岸和江汉平原未受涝灾的地区，农民们正对快要黄熟的中稻和已经结桃的棉花加强田间管理，争取丰收。长江沿岸部分被风雨吹倒的水稻，绝大部分已经扶起。各地农民还在紧张地为晚秋作物采积着肥料。浠水县七十多个农业生产合作社和六千多个常年互助组，正在为争取在每亩秋种田施肥五十至七十担而努力。受积水灾害的地区，农民们正以顽强精神排除积水，争取恢复生产和种上晚秋作物。麻城县农民在中共麻城县委员会领导下，开展了规模巨大的排渍复秋、抢薅保棉运动。现在麻城县的受渍田，大部积水已经排出；棉田里的荒草也基本上薅完。
    【新华社长沙七日电】湖南省洞庭湖周围受水灾地区人民已全面展开生产自救运动。灾区都已成立了生产救灾委员会，县以上并已成立了专门领导灾民生产自救的办公室。区、乡也有主要干部专门领导这项工作。从七月中旬以来，专区、县都已召开了生产救灾工作会议，订出了行动计划。在农业方面，首先是抓住季节种晚稻。目前，已退水的和地势较高的水田准备种植晚稻和杂粮。根据湖南省的季节，八月中旬还可以下种。因此，有些地区正在堵口排渍，抢种晚稻。如望城县半山半水的溃垸，决口处流水不急，现有十五个堤垸正在堵口排渍。其次是组织灾民在山区和丘陵地区开荒。湘阴县已计划开荒两万亩左右，并规定坡度在二十五度以下，在能保持水土保护山林的条件下进行。种籽问题，由于人民政府大力支持和群众互相兑换调剂，已得到解决。农民提出的口号是：“田里损失要由土里弥补”。在副业生产方面，主要是捕鱼。洪水带来了大量的鱼，现在各地都积极发动和组织灾民捕鱼。据群众的经验，在六万多亩田的垸子中，可产鱼四十万斤。望城县大明湖乡最近估计，全垸四千多亩田中可产鱼两万斤。湘阴县已组织两千一百多人集体捕鱼。一人捕鱼收入，可养活四人有余。大家提出的口号是：“水里损失要由水里弥补”。其次是编草鞋、斗笠、搓绳、结网等，也可以解决部分灾民的生活问题。
