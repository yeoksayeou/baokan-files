	Hainan Island Has Abundant Virgin Forest Resources
	According to preliminary investigations by the forestry authorities of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, Hainan Island has very rich virgin forests. The existing timber in Jianfengling alone is sufficient for new-style machine logging for ten years.
	Most of Hainan Island's virgin forests are located within the Li and Miao Autonomous Region, estimated to be over 900,000 mu, distributed in the high mountains from Liulianling and Zonghengling in the east, to Yinggeling and Baishaling in the west, from Fenshuiling in the north, to Qizhiling and Diaoluoshan in the south, with about 400,000 mu located on the Wuzhi Mountain at an altitude of more than 1,800 meters. The famous tree species include Gmelina, Taiwan Keteleeria, China Fir, Podocarpus nagi, and Fokienia hodginsii. The general tree age is from eighty to three hundred years. The coniferous trees on Diaoluo Mountain, such as Taiwan Keteleeria and China Fir, are as high as 20 meters, with a diameter of 1.66 meters and an age of 700 years. These woods are hard, resistant to pests, and suitable for making railway sleepers, shipbuilding, construction, and making agricultural tools and furniture.

    海南岛原始森林资源丰富
    据广东省人民政府林业机关的初步调查，海南岛上的原始森林非常丰富，单是尖峰岭现有的林木，已足供新式机器采伐十年。
    海南岛的原始森林，大部分在黎族苗族自治区内，估计有九十万亩以上，分布在东起六连岭、纵横岭，西至英哥岭、白沙岭，北起分水岭，南至七指岭、吊罗山的高山上，其中在拔海一千八百多公尺的五指山上的有四十万亩左右。著名的树种有石梓、陆均松、鸡毛松、竹叶松、罗维松等。一般的树龄是从八十年到三百年。吊罗山上的针叶树如陆均松、鸡毛松，有高达二十公尺、直径一点六六公尺、树龄七百年的。这些木材质地坚硬，不受虫害，适宜于做铁道枕木、造船、建筑、制农具家具等。
