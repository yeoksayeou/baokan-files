    Seize the Time, Expedite the Completion of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" Study Plan

    Since July of last year, the high and intermediate-level groups of the whole party's cadre theoretical study, in accordance with the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Cadre Theoretical Education in 1953-1954," began studying Chapters IX to XII of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." This instruction from the Central Committee set off a wave of enthusiasm among cadres for studying the theory of socialist economic construction in the Soviet Union, which made extremely beneficial preparations for the study of the general line for the transition period by the whole party last winter, and powerfully helped cadres understand our country's general line for the transition period. Therefore, the role of this study is enormous. In addition, the interest and enthusiasm of many cadres in studying theory has also been enhanced as a result. Therefore, this instruction from the Central Committee is entirely correct and timely.

    According to the provisions of this instruction from the Central Committee, Chapters IX to XII of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and related documents should be completed by the end of 1954. However, since last winter and this spring, the whole party has conducted a massive study of the party's general line for the transition period and the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party. From mid-June of this year, discussions on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China have also been conducted, so the time for studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" should be extended. Now that the discussions on the draft Constitution have ended or are about to end, and the study of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" has resumed or is about to resume in various places, the Party committees and the departments in charge of theoretical education under the leadership of the Party committees in various places must seize the time from now on and expedite the completion of the study plan for Chapters IX to XII of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)."

    To seize the time means not to arbitrarily encroach on the time for studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," and not to arbitrarily postpone the progress of studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." Some regions are far behind in the study progress, mostly because they postponed the study progress from the beginning, and then were delayed by other temporary studies. Of course, due to different conditions in various places, some measures adapted to local conditions are certainly possible, but when it is necessary to make some postponements, it should also be postponed as little as possible, and try to remedy it as much as possible. It must be pointed out that the necessity of this postponement of the study progress should not be overemphasized for the majority of major regions in the country. In future theoretical studies, except for special circumstances, the study progress in various places should be gradually unified in principle. Although the progress of studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" has been affected in the past due to too many temporary studies being inserted, the fact proves that some units are still able to complete the study of Chapter X of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and related documents under the same circumstances, and some other regions also have relatively fast study progress, which is mainly achieved because they can seize the time. Many cadres have a wrong concept about the study progress. They often think that it is bad not to complete the work plan on schedule, but it is irrelevant not to complete the study plan on schedule. They often arbitrarily extend the study progress plan, or although they have a plan, they do not seriously implement it, let alone seriously check it. Therefore, time is dragged on. One example of this failure to seize time is that the discussion of the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China was originally scheduled to end on August 15, but some regions will not resume the study of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" until September 1, which is an unnecessary waste of time. It must be pointed out that some important temporary studies will still be unavoidable in the future, and various places must seize the time and expedite the completion of the central government's plan to study the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" without wasting time.

    At the same time, the study time for each unit should also be appropriately compressed. That is, according to the content of the documents, calculate the necessary reading time and the necessary lecturing time, and stipulate the time limit for studying a certain unit. All party cadres have studied the party's general line for the transition period, which is a favorable condition for accelerating the progress of the current study of Chapters IX to XII of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." Failing to see this condition will not only waste time, but also deviate from the needs of the cadres. In addition, the study method should also be appropriately changed. In the future study of Chapters IX to XII of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and related documents, the main requirement should be placed on carefully reading the documents. Intermediate-level groups should also appropriately organize lectures and reports. Attention should be paid not to let the discussion and research of some local and trivial issues hinder the overall progress. It must be pointed out that the idea of sticking to the old ways, thinking that every study must go through the stages of preview, explanation, review, discussion, answering questions and summary, and thinking that only by lengthening the time can it be learned well, and the idea of demanding too much, attempting to read a lot of reference materials, listen to a lot of reports, and attempting to solve all the problems raised by cadres in one study are also unrealistic. After studying our party's general line in the transition period in our country, as long as cadres carefully read the documents stipulated in the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Cadre Theoretical Education in 1953-1954," they will definitely be able to improve theoretically and inspire them to correctly utilize the experience of the Soviet Union in building a socialist society, thereby deepening their understanding of our party's general line in the transition period in our country. Inevitably, some difficult problems will be left over in the study. Of course, appropriate discussions should be conducted on these problems, but if they are still difficult to solve after discussion, they may be reserved for continued study in the future study process. Doing so is by no means lowering the requirements of the study, because some theoretical difficult problems should originally be solved through a longer period of research, so doing so is in line with the current situation and practical needs.

    Around the beginning of studying Chapter X of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," cadres in various places showed some complacency, thinking that since they had studied the general line, there was nothing to learn in Chapter X of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," and thinking that they had understood the issue of socialist industrialization "almost." Undoubtedly, this mood is harmful. Because the study of the general line cannot replace the study of Chapters IX and XII of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." Because our country's general line is the general policy planned by the Party Central Committee starting from the social situation in our country's transition period to guide our country towards a socialist society, while the content of Chapters IX to XII of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" is a summary of the process and experience of the Soviet Union in building a socialist society. The two cannot be confused. In fact, many cadres have not clarified some basic issues related to socialist industrialization even though they have studied the party's general line in our country's transition period. Today's report in this newspaper on the experience of Nanning City, Guangxi Province in overcoming the complacent mood of cadres illustrates this issue. The results of tests held by some units also prove that many cadres do not understand many issues related to socialist industrialization, but they are also equally complacent and despise this study. These people who thought they were "almost there" were greatly surprised after the test and became a little more humble. In addition, today's report in this newspaper on the gains of the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Central People's Government in studying Chapter X of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" also proves that earnestly studying the content of Chapter X of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and related documents can help cadres understand the theory of socialist industrialization and the arduous and complex nature of the industrialization cause, the significance of formulating a five-year plan for developing the national economy, and improve cadres' vigilance against class struggle, and strengthen the necessity of party leadership and unity, and can obtain many important gains. Therefore, lowering the significance of studying this chapter is completely incorrect and unfounded. Many cadres naturally demand that this study be more in-depth after studying the general line, which is completely legitimate. Therefore, when conducting this study, some supplementary reports or discussions should be organized under possible conditions, for example, introducing and explaining some basic knowledge of political economy (such as the basic economic law of socialism, the law of planned proportional development, the theory of reproduction, etc.) to everyone, helping everyone further understand the actual situation of industrialization and agricultural collectivization in our country, and further criticize various erroneous ideas that hinder the industrialization cause. Doing so is necessary, but it should not be required too much. This is of course due to objective difficulties (such as fewer teachers and reporters, and fewer reference materials), and also because for all cadres with self-study ability, the most important method of studying Marxism-Leninism should still be self-study. The method of not reading seriously and focusing on relying on listening to reports and discussion meetings should be changed. Advocating serious reading and pointing out that serious reading will definitely yield results is still an important issue that should be emphasized at present.

    Of course, seizing the time and expediting the completion of the study plan is not advocating sloppy work. Sloppy work is wrong in any case. Seizing the time here mainly opposes procrastination, opposes the phenomenon of demanding too much and neglecting to seize the time, and opposes the phenomenon of overemphasizing the special circumstances of the region and arbitrarily delaying the study progress. In the future, time must be fully utilized in order to expedite the completion of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" study plan, and those regions with particularly slow progress should pay special attention to this issue, so that cadres can complete the study plan stipulated by the central government with full enthusiasm as soon as possible and prepare to meet new study tasks.

### 抓紧时间，尽速完成“联共（布）党史”的学习计划

    抓紧时间，尽速完成“联共（布）党史”的学习计划
    全党干部理论学习的高、中级组，从去年七月起，按照“中共中央关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”，开始了“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章的学习。中央的这一指示，掀起了干部学习苏联社会主义经济建设理论的热潮，对去年冬季全党学习过渡时期的总路线，作了极有益的准备，有力地帮助了干部对我国过渡时期总路线的理解。因此，这一学习的作用是巨大的。除此之外，许多干部学习理论的兴趣和积极性也因此提高了。所以，中央这一指示是十分正确的，适时的。
    按照中央这一指示的规定，“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章和有关文件应该在一九五四年底以前学完。但去冬今春以来，全党进行了规模巨大的关于党在过渡时期总路线的学习和关于党的七届四中全会决议的学习，从今年六月中旬起，又进行了中华人民共和国宪法草案的讨论，因此
  “联共（布）党史”的学习的时间应该加以延长。现在，关于宪法草案的讨论已经结束或即将结束，各地关于“联共（布）党史”的学习已经恢复或即将恢复，各地党委和党委领导理论教育工作部门，今后必须抓紧时间，尽速完成“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章的学习计划。
    所谓抓紧时间就是不要随意侵占学习“联共（布）党史”的时间，不要随意推迟学习“联共
  （布）党史”的进度。有些地区在学习进度上落后很远，多半是由于从开始的时候起就推迟了学习的进度，后来又由于其它临时性的学习而耽搁下来的。自然，由于各地情况不同，某些因地制宜的措施当然是可以的，但是在有必要作某些推延的时候，也应该尽量推延得少一些，并尽量设法补救。必须指出，这种推延学习进度的必要性，对于全国大多数主要地区来说，是不应该过分强调的。在今后的理论学习方面，除特殊情况以外，应该逐步使各地的学习进度能在基本上统一起来。虽然过去因为临时性的学习插入太多，以致影响“联共（布）党史”学习的进度，但事实证明，在同样的情况下今天仍有某些单位能够学完了“联共（布）党史”第十章和有关文件，另外也还有一些地区学习进度也比较快，这主要就是由于能够抓紧时间而达到的。有许多干部对学习进度存在着一种错误的观念，他们往往认为不按期完成工作计划是不好的，但不按期完成学习计划却是无关重要的。他们对学习进度计划往往随意延长，或者虽然有计划，并不认真执行，更不认真检查。因此，时间就拖下去了。这种对于时间抓得不紧的例子之一，就是干部对中华人民共和国宪法草案的讨论原来规定在八月十五日结束，但是，有的地区却要到九月一日才恢复“联共（布）党史”的学习，这就是不必要地浪费了时间。必须指出，今后某些重要的临时性的学习还是不可避免的，各地务须抓紧时间，不浪费时日地尽速完成中央规定的学习“联共（布）党史”的计划。
    同时也应该适当压缩每一单元的学习时日。这就是要按照文件内容，计算出必要的阅读时间和必要的讲授时间，规定学习某一单元的时限。全党干部已经学习了党在过渡时期的总路线，这就是目前学习“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章的进度可以加快的有利的条件。看不到这个条件，不仅会虚耗时日，也会脱离干部的需要。此外，在学习方法方面，也应作适当的改变。在今后学习“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章和有关文件的时候，主要的要求，应该放在认真阅读文件上。中级组还应适当地组织讲课和报告。应该注意不要让讨论和研究某些局部的、枝节的问题妨碍了整个的进度。必须指出，那种墨守成规，认为每一项学习都必须经过预习、讲解、复习、讨论、解答问题和总结等阶段，和认为只有把时间拉长才能学好的观点是不对的，那种要求过高，企图阅读很多的参考资料，听很多报告，企图在一次学习当中把干部提出的各种问题都加以解决的想法也是不实际的。在学习了我们党在我国过渡时期的总路线之后，只要干部认真阅读“中共中央关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”中规定的文件，就一定能使大家在理论上提高一步，并启发他们根据苏联建成社会主义社会的经验，正确地加以利用，因而加深对我们党在我国过渡时期总路线的领会。在学习中必然会遗留下若干较难解决的问题，对这些问题，固然要进行适当的讨论，但是，如果讨论之后仍难解决，就不妨保留起来，在今后学习过程中继续研究。这样做决不是降低学习的要求，因为有某些理论上的疑难问题，原是应该经过较长时期研究才能解决的，所以，这样做是符合当前情况和实际需要的。
    各地干部在学习“联共（布）党史”第十章开始前后，表现出了某些自满情绪，以为既学了总路线，“联共（布）党史”第十章就没有什么可学的了，认为自己对社会主义工业化问题的理解已经
  “差不多了”。无疑的，这种情绪是有害的。因为，总路线的学习并不能代替“联共（布）党史”第九章和第十二章的学习。因为，我国的总路线是党中央从我国过渡时期的社会情况出发，规划出来的引导我国走向社会主义社会的总方针，而“联共（布）党史”第九章到第十二章的内容是苏联建成社会主义社会的经过和经验的总结。两者是不能混同起来的。事实上，有不少干部虽然学过了党在我国过渡时期的总路线，但是对于有关社会主义工业化的一些基本问题并没有弄清楚。今天本报刊载的广西省南宁市克服干部自满情绪的经验，就说明了这一问题。有的单位举行测验的结果，也证明有许多干部对有关社会主义工业化的许多问题并不懂得，但是也同样地自满，并轻视这一学习。这些自以为“差不多了”的人，经过测验之后，才大吃一惊，变得谦逊了一些。此外，今天本报刊载的中央人民政府对外贸易部学习“联共（布）党史”第十章的收获，也证明认真学习“联共（布）党史”第十章和有关文件的内容，在帮助干部理解社会主义工业化的理论和工业化事业艰苦复杂的性质，制定发展国民经济五年计划的意义，提高干部对于阶级斗争的警惕性，加强党的领导和统一的必要性方面，都能得到许多重要的收获。因此，降低学习这一章的意义，是完全不正确的，是没有根据的。许多干部由于学过了总路线，要求这一学习能更深入一些，自然是完全正当的。因此，在进行这一学习时，应该在可能的条件下组织一些补充的报告或讨论，例如，向大家介绍和讲解某些政治经济学的基本知识（例如社会主义基本经济法则，有计划按比例发展的法则，关于再生产的理论等），帮助大家进一步了解我国工业化和农业合作化的实际情况，进一步批判各种妨害工业化事业的错误思想。这样做是必要的，但也不应该要求过高。这固然是由于客观上的困难（例如教员和作报告的人少，参考资料少），而且也因为对于一切有自修能力的干部来说，最主要的学习马克思列宁主义的方法，仍旧应该是自修。不认真读书，着重依靠听报告和讨论会的办法，是应该改变的。提倡认真读书，指出认真读书必有所得，仍是目前应该强调的重要的问题。
    自然，抓紧时间，尽速完成学习计划，并不是提倡草率从事。草率从事在任何情况下都是不对的。这里所说的抓紧时间，主要是反对拖沓情绪，反对要求过高而忽视抓紧时间的现象，反对过分强调地区情况特殊而随意拖延学习进度的现象。今后必须充分利用时间，以便尽速完成“联共（布）党史”学习计划，那些进度特别迟缓的地区尤其要重视这一问题，以便能够使干部情绪饱满地及早完成中央规定的学习计划，准备迎接新的学习任务。
