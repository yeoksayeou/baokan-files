The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government recently circulated the "Decision on Improving the Quality of Primary and Secondary Education in Beijing" issued by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to all regions. It requested that education administrative leading organs at all levels, in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council, combine it with the actual conditions of their localities, refer to the decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee, and take effective and specific measures to actively and steadily improve the quality of primary and secondary education. The circular stated:

Since liberation more than four years ago, there has been great development in primary and secondary education. However, the low quality of education is the main shortcoming in the current work of general education. In the past, our ministry did not pay enough attention to improving the quality of education, lacked clear ideological guidance for improving teaching, failed to grasp the work of compiling teaching materials, lacked due guidance for teachers' learning, neglected political and ideological education, especially labor education, and lacked supervision and inspection of work to improve students' health. These are the main reasons for this shortcoming. In order to enable primary and secondary education to better serve the country's general task during the transition period, to ensure the supply of qualified new students to colleges and secondary vocational schools year by year, and to ensure the supply of labor reserve forces with a certain political consciousness, cultural accomplishment, and healthy physique to the industrial and agricultural production fronts, we must take various effective measures in the future to actively and steadily improve the quality of primary and secondary education to meet the requirements of national construction. In December 1953 and June 1954, the Government Administration Council successively issued the "Instructions on Rectifying and Improving Primary Education" and the "Instructions on Improving and Developing Secondary Education." These two instructions made clear instructions on many major principled issues related to improving the quality of primary and secondary education. Education administrative leading organs at all levels should seriously study them and vigorously implement them. The "Decision on Improving the Quality of Primary and Secondary Education in Beijing" issued by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on June 28, 1954, formulated some principles and specific methods for improving quality in light of the specific situation of primary and secondary education in Beijing. We believe that these are concrete measures for implementing the above-mentioned instructions and are very good.

To improve the quality of education, in the final analysis, is to cultivate students to become comprehensively developed members of socialist society. In the process of improving the quality of education, all regions must correctly implement the principle of all-round development in education. The Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Improving and Developing Secondary Education" clearly pointed out: "Due to insufficient understanding of all-round development in education in the past, many schools have not paid attention to students' physical health, and have neglected the teaching of scientific knowledge because of emphasis on political and ideological education; recently, many schools have relaxed political and ideological education because of emphasis on the teaching of scientific knowledge. These one-sided practices that emphasize one aspect to the neglect of the other are incorrect and must be corrected." In the future, all regions must consider this issue comprehensively, plan as a whole, and prevent various one-sided and impatient practices. Only by correctly implementing the principle of all-round development in education can we truly achieve the goal of improving the quality of education.

To improve the quality of education and implement all-round development in education, the key lies in improving the teaching work of schools and grasping the important link of teaching work. Ensure that students are armed with scientific knowledge and socialist ideology, and that students exercise their bodies and strengthen their physique: ensure that teachers teach well and students learn well. In order for teachers to teach well and students to learn well, improving teachers' level and adapting teaching materials are decisive factors. Therefore, all regions must grasp teachers' political, cultural, and professional learning, especially combining it with teaching practice, to cultivate and improve them. In terms of teaching materials, in addition to our ministry's planned revision of secondary school teaching plans, modification of teaching syllabuses and textbooks, and compilation of a set of teaching guides for teachers, all regions can compile some necessary reference materials for teachers within the scope of their capabilities. Education administrative leading organs at all levels must further strengthen their leadership over teaching work, check teaching work in a planned and focused manner, and give specific guidance to various schools. Regions with the conditions should establish specialized institutions to manage teaching research and teaching guidance work.

    中央人民政府教育部发出通报
    要求各地采取措施提高中小学教育质量
    中央人民政府教育部最近将中国共产党北京市委员会发布的“关于提高北京市中小学教育质量的决定”通报各地，要求各级教育行政领导机关，根据政务院指示，结合当地的实际情况，参照北京市委的决定，采取有效的具体措施，积极地稳步地提高中小学教育的质量。通报说：
    解放四年多来，中、小学教育都有了很大的发展，但是教育质量不高，却是当前普通教育工作中的主要缺点。过去我部对于提高教育质量是注意不够的，对改进教学缺乏明确的思想领导，对教材编辑工作没有抓紧，对教师学习缺乏应有的指导，对政治思想教育特别是对劳动教育有所忽视，对改善学生健康状况的工作缺乏督促与检查，这就是造成产生这一缺点的主要原因。为了使得中小学教育更好地为国家在过渡时期的总任务而服务，保证供应高等学校和中等专业学校以逐年递增的合格的新生，保证供应工农业生产战线上以具有一定政治觉悟、文化教养和健康体质的劳动后备力量，今后必须采取各种有效措施，积极地稳步地提高中小学教育质量，以满足国家建设事业的要求。一九五三年十二月和一九五四年六月中央人民政府政务院先后发布了“关于整顿和改进小学教育的指示”和“关于改进和发展中学教育的指示”，这两个指示对于有关提高中小学教育质量的许多重大的原则性的问题，都作了明确的指示，各级教育行政领导机关均应认真地加以研究，大力地贯彻执行。中国共产党北京市委员会一九五四年六月二十八日发布的“关于提高北京市中小学教育质量的决定”，针对北京市中小学教育的具体情况，规定了一些提高质量的原则和具体办法，这是贯彻执行上述指示的具体措施，我们认为是很好的。
    提高教育质量，归根到底就是要培养学生成为社会主义社会全面发展的成员。各地区在提高教育质量的过程中，必须正确地贯彻全面发展的教育原则。政务院“关于改进和发展中学教育的指示”中，明确指出：“由于过去对全面发展的教育认识不足，有许多学校对学生的身体健康问题一直是不注意的，并曾因强调政治思想教育而忽视科学知识的教学；最近又有不少学校因重视科学知识的教学而放松政治思想教育，这些顾此失彼的片面作法，都是不对的，必须予以纠正。”今后各地区在这一问题上，必须全面考虑，通盘筹划，防止各种片面的急躁的作法。只有正确地贯彻了全面发展的教育原则，才能真正达到提高教育质量的目的。
    提高教育质量、贯彻全面发展的教育，关键在于改进学校的教导工作、抓紧作好教学工作这一重要环节。保证能以科学知识和社会主义思想武装学生，并使学生锻炼身体，增强体质：保证教师教好，学生学好。为使教师教好，学生学好，提高教师水平与改编教材又是决定因素。因此各地区必须抓紧教师的政治、文化与业务学习，特别是结合教学实践，培养与提高他们。在教材方面，除我部有计划地修订中学教学计划、修改教学大纲和教科书，并为教师编辑一套教学指导书外，各地区在可能范围内，可以编辑一些必要的教师参考材料。各级教育行政领导机关必须进一步加强对教学工作的领导，有计划有重点地检查教导工作，给各校以具体指导。有条件的地区，应建立专门机构，管理教学研究与教学指导工作。
