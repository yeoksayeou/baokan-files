    Industrial Construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    Xie Tianquan
    In the seven years since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, not only have agriculture and animal husbandry production exceeded the highest levels before the Anti-Japanese War, but modern industry has also begun to take shape. Now, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has entered a new period of further construction.
    When Inner Mongolia was first liberated, modern industry in the eastern region consisted only of power plants in Ulanhot, Tongliao, and Hailar, and a flour mill in Yakeshi. These factories were small in scale, with dilapidated equipment and incomplete machinery, and were in a state of shutdown and stoppage. The situation of the power plants, flour mills, and the semi-mechanized former Gui Sui wool textile factory in the western region, originally belonging to Gui Sui and Baotou, was equally miserable. The weakness of the industrial base created a deformed economic situation in Inner Mongolia: Inner Mongolia produced a large number of livestock and furs, but the leather and various leather products needed by the people of Inner Mongolia had to be imported from outside the region. Even the felt products and leather boots necessary for the lives of herdsmen had to be supplied by Harbin, Shenyang, Zhangjiakou, and other places. There was no machine food processing industry or dairy industry, so that herdsmen had to throw away the surplus milk. It is estimated that the value of milk wasted each year amounted to one million tons of grain.
    Since the establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, especially in the past three years, Inner Mongolia's weak industry has achieved considerable development through rectification and new construction. By 1953, the output value of various industrial products in Inner Mongolia accounted for 17.8% of the total national economic output value of the region. Compared with 1950, the industrial output value increased by 5.16 times, and the number of employees increased by 2.9 times. At present, the number of industrial management cadres and technical personnel trained in and studying in various parts of the country has increased by about 15 times compared with the early days of the establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In order to help Inner Mongolia develop local industry and explore underground resources, the Central People's Government has transferred nearly 200 geological exploration personnel from various aspects to Inner Mongolia or trained them for Inner Mongolia. The existing factory and mine workers in Inner Mongolia have overcome various difficulties and improved equipment utilization and labor productivity. Since 1950, the industrial funds accumulated by workers through improving labor productivity and developing production, plus part of the state investment, have built eighteen local state-owned factories.
    The greatest achievement of Inner Mongolia's industry is the rapid development of the forest industry in the Greater Khingan Mountains. In the past few years, it has supported the national economic construction with a large number of sleepers, pit props, utility poles, and bridge timber. Forestry workers actively learn from Soviet advanced experience in logging. In the two years of 1951 and 1952, a total of 167,030 cubic meters of timber were saved for the country by reducing stumps and utilizing treetop wood.
    With the help of the Central People's Government, in 1953 alone, 46 kilometers of forest railways and 78 kilometers of highways were built in the primitive forest area, and transportation tractors, river exiting machines, and timber trucks were added. Starting this year, power stations will be built in the new forest area, and bulldozers and transportation machines will be added. The forest industry in Inner Mongolia is gradually moving from completely handicraft production to mechanized operation. This year, the logging volume of the forest industry will increase by 16 times compared with 1950.
    The power industry is also gradually developing. As of 1953, the increased power generation capacity of the entire region was equal to twice the power generation capacity of the original Gui Sui power plant. This year, a new type of thermal power plant will also be built in Baotou, and a new power plant will be built in Xilinhot, a grassland city.
    In order to improve animal husbandry production and improve the lives of herdsmen, 32 small dairy factories have been established in the grassland towns of Hulunbuir League, Jirem League, and Ulanqab League. These dairy industries increased the income of herdsmen by 6.237 billion yuan in 1953 alone, and supplied the country with a large amount of casein, lactose, milk powder, milk fat, and other industrial products. The Hailar Inner Mongolia Tannery, which has been merged, reorganized, expanded, and equipped with new machines, produces leather that not only meets the needs of the people in the region, but also is exported to many major cities across the country.
    In order to supply the lactose needed by the national pharmaceutical industry, Inner Mongolia has vigorously expanded the Hailar Milk Chemical Factory. This factory had only seven workers engaged in manual production in the early days of Inner Mongolia's liberation. Now it has more than 120 employees who operate with machinery and equipment. It is planned to increase the annual output of lactose to 1,000 tons during the first five-year plan.
    In order to meet the growing needs of farmers for means of production, there are currently nine newly built and expanded agricultural tool factories and agricultural tool repair shops in the region. This year, two large cart factories with mechanized equipment will be newly built in Ulanhot and Tongliao.

    内蒙古自治区的工业建设
    谢天全
    内蒙古自治区成立七年多来，不仅农业和畜牧业生产已超过了抗日战争以前的最高水平，而且开始有了近代化的工业。现在内蒙古自治区已进入进
  一步建设自治区的新时期。
    内蒙古刚解放时，近代性的工业，在东部区只有乌兰浩特、通辽、海拉尔的发电厂和牙克石的面粉厂。这几个工厂规模狭小、设备破旧、机器残缺，陷于停工停产的困境。西部地区原归绥和包头两市的发电厂、面粉厂和半机械设备的原归绥毛织厂的情况也同样凄惨。工业基础的薄弱造成内蒙古经济的畸形局面：内蒙古出产大量的牲畜与皮毛，但内蒙古人民所需要的皮革与各种皮件制品却不得不依靠区外输入，甚至连牧民生活上所必需的毛毡品、皮靴等，也依靠哈尔滨、沈阳、张家口等地供应；没有机器食品加工业，也没有乳品工业，以致牧民们不得不把剩余的牛奶扔掉，据估计每年这样浪费的牛奶价值达一百万吨粮食。
    内蒙古自治区人民政府成立以来，特别是近三年来，经过整顿和新建，内蒙古幼弱的工业已获得相当程度的发展。到一九五三年，内蒙古各种工业品产值已占全区国民经济总产值百分之十七点八，与一九五○年相比较，工业产值增加了五点一六倍，职工人数增加了二点九倍。目前内蒙古自治区已经培养出来和正在全国各地学习的工业管理干部与技术人材比自治区人民政府成立初期已增加了十五倍左右。为了帮助内蒙古发展地方工业、勘察地下资源，中央人民政府从各方面抽调给内蒙古或为内蒙古培养的地质勘探人员将近二百名。内蒙古现有厂矿职工克服了各种困难，提高了设备利用率与劳动生产率。从一九五○年以来由职工提高劳动生产率发展生产所积累的工业资金，加上国家的部分投资，已兴建了十八个地方国营工厂。
    内蒙古工业的最大成就是大兴安岭的森林工业有了日新月异的发展。在过去几年中曾以大量的枕木、坑木、电线柱和桥梁木支援全国的经济建设。林业工人在采伐中积极学习苏联先进经验，在一九五一和一九五二的两年中，由于降低伐根和利用梢头木共给国家节省了十六万七千零三十立方公尺木材。
    在中央人民政府的帮助下，仅在一九五三年就在原始森林地带修筑了四十六公里长的森林铁路和七十八公里长的公路，增添了运搬拖拉机、出河机和运材卡车。从今年起将在新林区建设发电站，添置归楞机和运搬机。内蒙古森林工业正由完全手工业生产逐步走向机械化作业。今年森林工业的采伐量将比一九五○年增加十六倍。
    电力工业也在逐步发展。截至一九五三年全区增加的发电量等于原归绥电厂的二倍发电能力。今年还将在包头建立一个新式的火力发电厂，在草原城市锡林浩特新建一个发电厂。
    为了提高牧业生产，改善牧民生活，在呼纳盟、哲里木盟和乌兰察布盟的草原城镇建立了三十二个小型的乳品工厂。这些乳品工业在一九五三年一年内就给牧民增加了六十二亿三千七百多万元的收入，而且供应了全国大量的酪胶、乳糖、乳粉、乳油等工业品。经过合并、整顿和扩建后用新式机器装备起来的海拉尔内蒙古制革厂，所产的皮革不仅供应本区人民的需要，而且大量输送到全国许多主要的大城市。
    为了供应全国医药工业上需要的乳糖，内蒙古大力扩建了海拉尔牛乳化工厂。这个工厂在内蒙古解放初期只有七个工人进行手工生产，现在已有一百二十多个职工，使用机器设备进行操作，计划在第一个五年计划内年产乳糖量要增加到一千吨。
    为了供应农民日益增长的生产资料需要，目前全区新建和扩建的农具工厂和农具修配厂已有九个。今年在乌兰浩特和通辽又新建两个具有机械化设备的大车工厂。
