    China Peace Committee Cables Korean Peace Committee to Congratulate the Ninth Anniversary of the August 15th Korean Liberation Day
   [Xinhua News Agency, August 15th] The China People's Committee for World Peace sent a cable to the Korean National Committee for the Promotion of Peace, congratulating them on the ninth anniversary of the liberation of Korea. The cable is as follows:
    Korean National Committee for the Promotion of Peace:
      August 15th is the great anniversary of the Korean people's long, arduous, and heroic struggle, which finally resulted in national liberation from the colonial enslavement of Japanese imperialism with the help of the powerful Soviet Red Army. The China People's Committee for World Peace extends warm congratulations to the heroic Korean people.
    This glorious and great national festival of the Korean people demonstrates to the world that the Korean people are a nation that loves their motherland, dares to strive for and is good at defending their national independence, and does not allow any imperialist bullying and invasion.
    The US imperialists are unwilling to accept the lessons of history and disregard the great power of the awakened Korean people. Following the old path of Japanese imperialism, they launched the Korean war of aggression in 1950, attempting to achieve their insidious goal of dominating the entire Korean peninsula and invading Asia, especially new China. However, the result of the three-year Korean War once again proved that the Korean people are always the victors, and imperialism is always the loser.
    Now, the US imperialists are still recklessly obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and hindering the unification of the Korean nation, plotting to undermine the solemn Korean Armistice Agreement. We, the Chinese people, firmly believe that on this great festival of national liberation for the Korean people, the Korean people will be able to concentrate their will and strength to make more heroic and resolute efforts to further consolidate peace in Korea and strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea. This struggle of the Korean people will never be isolated; it will always receive the strong support of the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world. We, the Chinese people, will stand firmly with the fraternal Korean people, just as we did during the Korean War.
    August 15th, this glorious and great festival of Korean people's liberation, will forever radiate its light in Korea, Asia, and the world!
          China People's Committee for World Peace

    我保卫世界和平委员会致电朝鲜拥护和平委员会
    祝贺“八·一五”朝鲜解放九周年纪念日
   【新华社十五日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会致电朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会，祝贺朝鲜解放九周年。电文如下：朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会：
      “八·一五”是朝鲜人民进行了长期艰苦卓绝的英勇斗争，最后终于在强大的苏联红军帮助下，从日本帝国主义的殖民奴役中获得了民族解放的伟大纪念日，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会谨向英雄的朝鲜人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    朝鲜人民的这一光荣和伟大的民族节日，向全世界昭示着，朝鲜人民是一个热爱他们自己的祖国，勇于争取和善于保卫他们民族的独立，不容任何帝国主义欺凌与侵犯的不可征服的民族。
    美帝国主义者不愿接受历史的教训，并无视已经觉醒了的朝鲜人民的伟大力量，沿袭日本帝国主义的老路，在一九五○年发动了朝鲜的侵略战争，妄图达到其统治整个朝鲜和侵略亚洲，特别是侵略新中国的阴险的目的。然而，三年朝鲜战争的结果再一次证明了朝鲜人民永远是胜利者，帝国主义永远是失败者。
    现在，美帝国主义还在甘冒不韪，多方阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决并阻挠朝鲜民族的统一，阴谋破坏庄严的朝鲜停战协定，我们中国人民坚决相信，值兹朝鲜人民民族解放的伟大节日，朝鲜人民必能集中他们的意志与力量，为进一步巩固朝鲜和平，争取朝鲜的和平统一而作更英勇坚决的斗争。朝鲜人民的这种斗争将决不会是孤立的，它将永远得到以苏联为首的和平阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民的有力支持。我们中国人民也将和在朝鲜战争中一样坚决地与兄弟般的朝鲜人民紧紧地站在一起。
    “八·一五”这一光荣和伟大的朝鲜人民解放的节日将永远在朝鲜，也将在亚洲以及全世界放射着它的光芒！
          中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
                      一九五四年八月十五日
