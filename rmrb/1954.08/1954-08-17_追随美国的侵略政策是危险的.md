    Following the US Aggressive Policy is Dangerous
  　Gao Ji
    Ignoring the opposition of many Asian countries, the United States announced on August 14 its decision to hold a meeting with its allies in Baguio, Philippines on September 6 to establish the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. The policy of the US ruling clique to undermine Asian peace and create new wars in the Asian region is becoming more and more rampant and openly carried out.
    The Southeast Asia aggressive bloc is an antagonistic military group. The main goal of the United States in organizing this group is to invade China and undermine the collective cooperation of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue. The US ruling clique attempts to conceal its ambitions. The US State Department, in a statement issued on August 14, even described the purpose of the US in organizing the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc as to "strengthen the structure of peace throughout Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific." This kind of ghost talk certainly cannot deceive people. The mouthpiece of the US ruling clique, "Newsweek," revealed in a recent issue that the United States "intends to make the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization a joint warning to Communist China" and pointed out that the United States will use economic aid, technical assistance, and propaganda programs to "encourage" Asian countries to oppose China. It is precisely because many Asian countries have seen through this plan of the US ruling clique to have "Asians fight Asians" that they oppose this aggressive plan of the United States and refuse to participate in the aggressive bloc organized by the United States. The desire of Asian countries is to establish collective peace, not antagonistic military blocs. The aggressive and adventurous plans of the US ruling clique are becoming increasingly unpopular in Asia.
    The US plan to organize the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc can actually only be said to be a military alliance that colonial countries are trying to establish in order to continue to dominate Asian affairs. It is completely contrary to the goal of strengthening peace in the region. It is enough to point out that, among the countries in Southeast Asia, only the Luang Phibuns group of Thailand and the Magsaysay group of the Philippines have been roped into this organization. Although Pakistan is preparing to participate in the Baguio Conference, it has stated that it is unwilling to assume the obligation to participate in this organization in advance. The remaining countries preparing to participate are the United Kingdom, France, Australia, and New Zealand. Among these countries, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand have already concluded bilateral or trilateral military alliance treaties with the United States, undertaking military obligations in the aggressive and adventurous plans of the United States; the Luang Phibuns group of Thailand has also accepted US military aid for many years, actively seeking to act as a US tool of aggression in Asia. The US propaganda machine has repeatedly and publicly promoted that the US planned Southeast Asia aggressive bloc is an expansion of the US-Australia-New Zealand Pact and a replica of the North Atlantic aggressive organization in Asia. It can be seen that the conspiracy played by the United States is to drag more countries, including the United Kingdom and France, into its aggressive and adventurous plans, forcing them to undertake the same military obligations as the Philippines and other countries, in order to expand US aggressive activities. This approach by the United States is clearly increasingly seriously threatening peace in Asia and the world.
    In order to create new tensions in Asia, the United States has painstakingly tried to undermine the Geneva Conference agreements on restoring peace in Indochina. To this end, the US ruling clique has repeatedly promoted the idea of dragging Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, or at least listing them as areas "protected" by this bloc. This is a clear violation of the Geneva Conference agreements, because the Geneva Conference agreements clearly stipulated that the Indochina countries must not participate in any military blocs. However, the French government, which had shown sincerity in seeking to restore peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference, is now following the US rhetoric, saying that Laos and Cambodia can join the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. The spokesman for the French government's Ministry of Relations with Member States of the Federation openly said in a statement issued on August 12: "As long as the terms of the Southeast Asia Defense Treaty comply with the United Nations Charter, Laos and Cambodia have the right to join this treaty." This statement is clearly untenable. The British Foreign Office rightly disagreed with this statement and reiterated on August 13 the views expressed by British Foreign Secretary Eden in a speech in the British House of Commons on July 22. In that speech, Eden clearly pointed out: "At the same time, a clear understanding has been reached: none of these three countries (Laos, Cambodia, and Bao Dai Vietnam) may allow the establishment of foreign military bases on their territory, nor may they participate in military alliances." At the same time, the US approach of organizing military aggressive blocs is also completely contrary to the purposes of the United Nations Charter; the purpose of the United Nations Charter is to promote international cooperation and maintain international peace and security, while the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc organized by the United States is to prepare for new wars. The US attempt to drag Laos, Cambodia, and other countries into this bloc is a clear manifestation of its desire to undermine the Geneva Conference and endanger the Indochina armistice. This is clearly detrimental to the French people. The French authorities undertook the obligation at the Geneva Conference to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Conference agreements on restoring peace in Indochina, but now they are making such expressions that are only beneficial to the US war plans and detrimental to Indochina peace and the French people. This cannot but arouse the serious attention and opposition of peace-loving people all over the world.
    The US conspiracy to organize the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc has created new tensions in Asia and is increasingly seriously threatening the implementation of the agreements on restoring peace in Indochina. As Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out in his diplomatic report on August 11: "If certain relevant countries participate in this divisive action of the US aggressive bloc, this will endanger the joint work of ensuring the restoration of peace in Indochina and will make the implementation of the Indochina armistice agreement subject to being undermined." Therefore, following the United States in organizing antagonistic military blocs in Southeast Asia is a very dangerous path, which is detrimental to the countries that are roped into this bloc.
    The Chinese people and the Asian people resolutely oppose this peace-damaging conspiracy of the US ruling clique and will certainly defeat this conspiracy plan of the US ruling clique through joint efforts.

    追随美国的侵略政策是危险的
  　高集
    美国不顾许多亚洲国家的反对，已于八月十四日宣布决定和它的盟国在九月六日在菲律宾碧瑶举行成立东南亚侵略集团的会议。美国统治集团力图破坏亚洲和平，在亚洲地区制造新战争的政策已是越来越猖狂地在公开进行了。
    东南亚侵略集团是一个对立性的军事集团，美国组织这个集团的主要目标是为了侵略中国，破坏日内瓦会议与会各国在印度支那问题上的集体合作。美国统治集团企图掩饰他们所怀抱的野心，美国国务院在八月十四日发表的声明中，竟然把美国组织东南亚侵略集团的目的说成是为了“加强整个东南亚和西南太平洋地区的和平的结构”。这种鬼话当然是骗不了人的。美国统治集团的喉舌“新闻周刊”在最近的一期中就透露说，美国“打算使东南亚公约组织成为对共产党中国的联合警告”，并且指出美国将以经济援助、技术援助和宣传计划等手段来“鼓励”亚洲国家反对中国。正是由于许多亚洲国家看穿了美国统治集团的这种“亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划，因而它们反对美国的这种侵略计划，拒绝参加美国所组织的侵略集团。亚洲国家的愿望是要求建立集体的和平，而不要对立的军事集团。美国统治集团的侵略冒险计划，在亚洲是越来越不得人心了。
    美国组织东南亚侵略集团的计划，实际上只能说是殖民国家为了继续支配亚洲事务而企图成立的军事联盟，它是与加强这个地区的和平的目的完全背道而驰的。只要指出这一点就够了：在东南亚的国家中只有泰国的銮披汶集团和菲律宾的麦格赛赛集团被网罗到了这个组织之中，巴基斯坦虽然准备参加碧瑶会议，但是表示不愿事先承担参加这个组织的义务，其余准备参加的国家有英国、法国、澳大利亚和新西兰。在这些国家中，菲律宾、澳大利亚和新西兰早已和美国缔结了双边的或者三边的军事联盟条约，在美国的侵略冒险计划中承担了军事义务；泰国的銮披汶集团也多年来接受美国的军事援助，积极要充当美国在亚洲的侵略工具。美国宣传机器早已一再公开宣传美国计划中的东南亚侵略集团是美澳新公约的扩大和北大西洋侵略组织在亚洲的翻版。由此可见，美国所玩弄的阴谋就是要把更多的国家，包括英国和法国在内，拖入它的侵略冒险计划，强制它们承担和菲律宾等国一样的军事义务，来扩大美国的侵略活动。美国的这种做法，显然正日益严重地威胁着亚洲和世界的和平。
    美国为了在亚洲制造新的紧张形势，而处心积虑地要破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议。为此，美国统治集团早已一再宣传要把柬埔寨、老挝和越南南部拖入东南亚侵略集团，或者至少要把它们列入由这个集团“保护”的地区。这明显地是违反日内瓦会议的协议的，因为日内瓦会议的协议明确地规定了印度支那各国不得参加任何军事集团。但是，在日内瓦会议上曾经表现了诚意谋求恢复印度支那和平的法国政府，现在却追随着美国的论调，说什么老挝和柬埔寨可以加入东南亚侵略集团。法国政府联邦成员国关系部发言人在八月十二日发表的谈话中就公然说：“只要东南亚防御公约的条款符合联合国宪章，老挝和柬埔寨是有权利加入这个公约的”。这种说法显然是站不住脚的。英国外交部正当地不同意这种说法，并在八月十三日重申了英国外交大臣艾登在七月二十二日在英国下院发表的演说中所表示的意见。艾登在那次演说中曾明白指出：“同时，也取得明白的谅解：这三个国家（老挝、柬埔寨和保大越南）中的任何一国都不得容许在它们的领土上建立外国军事基地，也不得参加军事联盟。”同时，美国组织军事侵略集团的做法与联合国宪章的宗旨也是完全相违反的；联合国宪章的宗旨是促进国际合作，维持国际和平和安全，而美国组织的东南亚侵略集团却是为了准备新的战争。美国要把老挝、柬埔寨等国拉进这个集团，更是它想破坏日内瓦会议，危害印度支那停战的明白表现。这对法国人民显然是不利的。法国当局在日内瓦会议上担承了保证实现日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平协议的义务，现在却做出这种只是有利于美国的战争计划，而不利于印度支那和平，不利于法国人民的表示，这不能不引起全世界爱好和平人民的严重注意和反对。
    美国组织东南亚侵略集团的阴谋造成了亚洲的新的紧张形势，并日益严重地威胁着恢复印度支那和平协议的实施。正如我国周恩来总理兼外长在八月十一日所作的外交报告中所指出的：“如果某些有关国家竟参加美国侵略集团的这个分裂行动，这就将使保证恢复印度支那和平的共同工作遭受危害，并将使印度支那停战协定的实施有被破坏的可能。”因此，追随美国在东南亚组织敌对的军事集团，是一条十分危险的道路，它对于被网罗在这个集团中的国家都是不利的。
    中国人民和亚洲人民都坚决反对美国统治集团这种破坏和平的阴谋，并一定要以共同的努力击破美国统治集团的这一阴谋计划。
