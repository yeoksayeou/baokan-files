    In agricultural production cooperatives, the issue of income distribution is an extremely important policy. After the issue of improving production is resolved, income distribution becomes the issue of greatest concern to the masses. However, income distribution is a delicate task that has a far-reaching impact and is difficult to grasp. Based on last year's experience, cooperatives with the same level of production can consolidate internal cooperation and promote production in the coming year if the distribution work is done well; if it is not done well, it will cause some farmers to waver and affect future production. Now that the autumn harvest is not far away, the issue of income distribution in agricultural production cooperatives must be addressed as a priority. It cannot be done well if action is only taken when the time comes.
    The income distribution of cooperatives must not only conform to the nature of semi-socialist cooperative economy, but also reflect its role in promoting the development of new productive relations and productive forces. That is to say:
    First, it must correctly reflect the harmonious combination of individual interests and collective interests. The distribution of a cooperative's income includes approximately the following items: repayment of principal and interest on public and private loans, deduction of public reserve funds and public welfare funds, reservation of working capital for next year's production and management expenses, remuneration for members' privately owned means of production and labor remuneration, and others. But fundamentally, it can be divided into two major categories: public production expenses and personal income. Both are important and indispensable. However, an appropriate distribution ratio must be maintained between the two. In the past, some cooperatives distributed all of the cooperative's income entirely to personal income items, without leaving any public reserve funds, public welfare funds, or production expenses for the coming year. This would prevent the cooperative's production equipment from being improved, and the expansion of reproduction would be impossible, delaying the gradual growth of the socialist collective ownership system, thereby preventing the superiority of cooperative production from being brought into play. Some cooperatives paid attention to leaving public reserve funds and public welfare funds, but because they owed too much debt in the past or planned too much for the future, they left too much. This has created a situation where "the scale is large, there is a lot of waste, production develops but the income is not much," which has weakened the interest of many members in actively working and maintaining the common cause due to the lack of personal income. Therefore, properly arranging the distribution and maintaining an appropriate ratio between each item, especially between public funds and personal income, becomes an issue of principle. The so-called appropriate ratio should be arranged according to the cooperative's income situation and production development needs of the year. For example, the deduction of public reserve funds can be less for cooperatives with low income, enough to leave 1% to 3% of the total income, and more for cooperatives with high income, 5% to 8% is also possible. It is certain that it is necessary to leave, but it would be wrong to leave too much, which is not commensurate with the increase in cooperative production, resulting in an excessive reduction in personal income.
  Second, it must correctly reflect the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit among all members. The superiority of the cooperative system over individual economy lies in the fact that the relationship between the internal members of the cooperative is based on mutual assistance and mutual benefit, moving forward along the road of common advancement and common prosperity. Any action that hinders mutual assistance and mutual benefit is an action that deviates from the goal of cooperation. Any practice that is likely to cause damage to the relationship of mutual assistance and mutual benefit must be avoided. Existing forms of cooperatives, because they are partial collective ownership, and land and other important means of production are still privately owned, and after being handed over to the cooperative for unified use, they still receive a certain amount of remuneration. Therefore, when distributing income, it is not possible to implement a complete system of distribution according to work; only a part of the income is distributed according to the amount and quality of labor, and another part of the income is actually distributed according to the amount and quality of land and other means of production owned by the members. Because some members, including some well-to-do middle peasants and households in difficulty who have lost their labor force, have relatively more land and relatively less labor force; and some members, including most poor peasants, have relatively less land and relatively more labor force. Therefore, when the cooperative's production and income growth is not very large, and the labor remuneration is not much higher than the social level, the distribution ratio of land remuneration and labor remuneration often becomes the focus of everyone's dispute, and if it is not handled properly, it will directly affect the relationship of mutual assistance and mutual benefit among the members. When the labor remuneration is too high and the land remuneration is too low, the income of some members with more land and less labor will be reduced compared to before joining the cooperative; conversely, when the land remuneration is too high and the labor remuneration is too low, some members with more labor and less land will suffer losses. Both of these high and low distribution ratios are not good. Once this situation occurs, it will cause internal disunity, which will not only affect those who have joined, but also affect those who have not joined, which is detrimental to the development and consolidation of cooperation. When dealing with this extremely complex practical problem, stubbornly adhering to one-sided principles, deviating from the cooperative's production development situation and the members' ideological awareness, and only emphasizing one party while ignoring the other party with regard to land remuneration and labor remuneration, will only cause confusion. The principle of correct handling should be: both to implement the policy of distribution according to work as the main principle, and to take care of the reasonable interests of land owners. Our principle is to gradually reduce the proportion of land remuneration and increase the proportion of labor remuneration with the degree of production growth, so as to finally realize a complete system of distribution according to work. With the increase of production income, labor remuneration should of course be increased accordingly. If the labor remuneration cannot be increased accordingly with the increase of production due to the excessive land remuneration, or although there is an increase, it is not commensurate with the increase of production, that is not right; in this case, the proportion of land remuneration should be resolutely and appropriately reduced, and the proportion of labor remuneration should be increased. Even if individual households have less income because they do not invest much labor, they should be handled separately instead of accommodating them. Conversely, if the income of the whole cooperative does not increase or increases limitedly, even if the land remuneration is reduced, the labor remuneration cannot be increased much, but more members' income will be reduced as a result, then the land remuneration should not be reduced at will. When some cooperatives have too low land remuneration originally, and as a result, there is an excessive income imbalance, it should also be adjusted appropriately, so as to unite all members on the basis of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, strive to develop production, and achieve decisive results in the increase of total income, and then reduce the proportion of land remuneration and gradually increase the proportion of labor remuneration. Continuing to develop in this way, after several years, when production is increased to a level of half to one times, it can be achieved in roughly realizing a complete system of distribution according to work. At present, some cooperatives have raised the land remuneration too high in order to win over well-to-do middle peasants to join the cooperative; and some cooperatives have suppressed the land remuneration too low in order to take care of the interests of poor peasants, regardless of the production development situation, both of which are wrong. The general requirement should be to gradually increase the income of all farmers who have joined the cooperative (except those who had some exploitative income before joining the cooperative), and to give special care to some special households in difficulty, such as widows, orphans, the elderly, the weak, the disabled, etc., so that everyone can see the benefits of cooperation and enthusiastically participate, and so that the common production cause can move forward smoothly and unhindered, creating the prerequisites for collective labor and the large-scale development of production.
    The steps and methods for carrying out the distribution work must also be paid close attention to. It can only be done well if it is regarded as a comprehensive activity combining political, economic, and financial work, and not merely as a technical distribution matter. According to past experience, these steps and methods should be:
    First of all, a trial calculation and distribution should be done before the autumn harvest. This is extremely beneficial, as it can avoid some blindness in the work (for example, treating the problems of individual households as general problems, or treating the problems of the majority as individual problems), exaggerating or underestimating the practical significance of a certain phenomenon, so that the cooperative's management committee can more scientifically understand the cooperative's income and expenditure and the income and expenditure situation of each household, and from here conduct further analysis, study the reasons for the decrease in income of the whole cooperative and some households, the scope involved, and its impact, find out the crux of the problem, so as to consider formulating several distribution plans. After repeated trial calculations and repeated comparisons, the advantages are taken and the disadvantages are avoided, and things are done better. Carrying out the trial calculation and distribution work early can also discover the shortcomings in production, alert everyone, seek opportunities, and strive to make another effort in the next few months after autumn to increase production and increase income, in order to make up for it.
    Secondly, it is necessary to combine distribution with the collective education of members in collectivism. In the distribution work, it is always inevitable that some members will have opinions on certain aspects of the problem. Among them, there will be many opinions that are justified from his personal interests, but are unreasonable or not very reasonable from the perspective of the interests of the whole cooperative, or are reasonable from tomorrow but not reasonable today; some opinions are superficially reasonable, but are actually unreasonable; and some opinions are expressed by the farmers' personal egoistic psychology, which can be said to be fundamentally unreasonable. On such a major issue as income distribution, it is understandable that farmers want to haggle over gains and losses, and it is wrong to ignore it completely. Only when both sides haggle can the problem be exposed, analyzed for its rationality, and solved separately. But after all, there are many things that can be ignored or are difficult to haggle over, and some are useless to haggle over. The final and most reasonable solution to these problems can only be solved under the general premise of everyone's hard work, developing production, increasing income, and making the cooperative cause prosperous. When encountering this situation, it is necessary to conduct in-depth and systematic socialist collectivist education to the masses, grasp specific examples, educate farmers to understand the correct relationship between personal interests and collective interests, short-term interests and long-term interests, and solve some of the disputes in the distribution problem that are difficult to solve at the time on a new common socialist understanding basis. That is to say, don't be afraid of farmers haggling over their own interests, but should guide them according to the situation, guiding them to solve the problem from the overall perspective. By doing so, not only can practical problems be solved naturally, but also the awareness of farmers can be raised, laying the foundation for solving other problems. The view that distribution work is only regarded as a technical work process, and not at the same time as a political work process, will inevitably spoil things. Of course, this does not mean that political education can be carried out in an empty way without solving practical problems, which would fall into another error of being divorced from reality. Everyone must remember that cooperation is the process of the struggle between collectivism and overcoming individualistic thinking, and this struggle must be completed through thousands of specific work steps. We must use every work step to improve the awareness of the masses, so that every work step has rich political work content.
    Finally, it is necessary to combine distribution, check production, check labor organization, and revise the plan. Distribution is the end of past production and the beginning of future efforts. Distribution will expose the shortcomings of those members who do not work diligently, and can also reveal the shortcomings of the entire cooperative in guiding production. Exposing the shortcomings is the beginning of improving the shortcomings. We must seize this beginning, actively strive, and first earnestly make up for it in the month or so before the autumn harvest. Such as carrying out land processing before autumn, preventing and controlling disasters, carefully harvesting, adding late-maturing crops, etc.; in the months after autumn, carrying out autumn plowing, doing a good job in winter production, building water conservancy, making and accumulating fertilizer, operating sideline businesses, etc., these will greatly help increase income in the future. Each cooperative has different ways to increase production, and has surplus labor that can be used. Therefore, there is great hope for increasing income. If the income increase is not much this year after distribution, we should strive to greatly increase it next year; if the income is high this year, we should strive to increase it even more next year. As long as we rely on collective strength, strive for perfection, and give full play to production potential, income will not fail to increase. If the comrades who guide the work are not good at guiding the masses to move forward when encountering some difficulties, but retreat backward with the volatile psychology of the masses, the consequences caused by the evolution will not only be the question of whether income can be increased, but the question of whether the cooperative can exist. This is especially important for cooperatives in disaster areas. This year, in the disaster areas, a lot of land was submerged by floods, some land had a bumper harvest, and some land had a reduced harvest or even no harvest. There will inevitably be many disputes when distributing income in the future. It is very difficult to find a solution here that satisfies everyone. The fairest and most basic way can only be to make everyone able to live this year, resolutely maintain the common cause, so that production can be restored as soon as possible, and strive for a bumper harvest next year. Therefore, in the disaster areas, it is not only necessary to handle the distribution of past production income, but the more important task is how to find ways to increase income in the future. If this point is not grasped, the continued existence and development of cooperatives in the disaster areas will have problems.
    In order to realize the above points, when the Party guides cooperatives in carrying out income distribution work, it must emphasize going deep into reality, creating typical examples, summarizing experience, and promoting it in a timely manner. In their work, each cadre must not only pay attention to investigation and research, calculation and comparison, but also be good at grasping the Party's basic policies, guiding them according to the situation, and patiently educating the masses. We must combine economic work and political work; do not engage in blind economism, nor engage in empty preaching.

    必须重视农业生产合作社的收益分配工作
    在农业生产合作社中，分配收益问题是一项极其重要的政策。当提高生产的问题得到解决之后，收益分配就成为群众最关心的问题了。但收益的分配是一件细致的工作，影响甚大，而难于掌握。根据去年经验来看，生产达到同样水平的合作社，分配工作做得好，可以巩固内部合作，推动来年的生产；做不好，就会引起部分农民的动摇心理，影响今后生产。现在离秋收的时间不远了，农业生产合作社的收益分配问题必须作为一个重点来加以解决，事到临头才动手是做不好的。
    合作社收益分配，既要符合于半社会主义合作经济的性质，又要体现出它推进新生的生产关系和生产力向前发展的作用。这就是说：
    第一，必须正确地体现个人利益和集体利益融洽结合的关系。一个合作社收入的分配、大约有如下几项：偿还公私借贷本息，扣除公积金公益金、预留来年生产流动资金和管理费用、对社员私有的生产资料报酬和劳动报酬以及其他。但从根本上划分，则不外乎公共生产费用和个人所得两大类。两者都重要，都是不可缺少的。但两者之间必须保持一个适当的分配比例。过去有些社，把社的全部收入完全分配到个人收入项下，没有留一点公积金、公益金和来年的生产费用。这样，就会使社的生产设备不能改善，扩大再生产无从进行，迟滞了社会主义的集体所有制逐步成长的过程，从而使合作生产的优越性不能发挥。又有些社，注意了留公积金、公益金，但由于过去欠外债太多或对今后铺排太大，留得太多了。这样就形成“摊子大，浪费多，生产发展而收益不多”的局面，使很多社员因个人收入不丰而减弱了他们积极劳动和维护共同事业的兴趣。因此，妥善地安排分配，使各个项目之间，特别是公共基金和个人收入之间保持适当的比例，就成为带有原则意义的问题。所谓适当的比例，应当根据各个社当年收入状况和生产发展需要来安排。例如对公积金的扣除，收入少的社可以少扣除一点，在总收入中留百分之一至三就够，收入多的社可以多留一点，百分之五至八也可以。需要留，这是肯定的，但留的过多，与合作社生产的增加不相适应，以致过分削减个人所得，就会成为错误。
  第二，必须正确体现全体社员之间互助互利的原则。合作制度，优越于个体经济之点，就在于社的内部成员之间的关系是建立在互助互利的基础上，沿着共同上升、大家富裕的道路前进。一切妨碍互助互利的行动，都是离开了合作化目标的行动。一切足以引起对互助互利关系发生破坏作用的做法，必须努力避免。现有形式的合作社，因为是部分的集体所有制，土地和其他重要生产资料仍属私有，在交社统一使用后，还取得一定的报酬。因此，在分配收入时，并不能实行完全的按劳分配制度，只是一部分收入按劳动的多少和好坏进行分配，而另一部分收入，实际上仍是按社员所有土地和其他生产资料的多少和好坏来分配。由于一部分社员，其中包括一些富裕中农和丧失劳动力的困难户，他们占有的土地相对的多，而劳动力相对的少；又有一部分社员，其中包括大部贫农，他们占有的土地相对的少而劳动力相对的多。所以当社的生产和收入增长不是很大，劳动报酬并不大过社会水平的时候，土地报酬和劳动报酬的分配比例常常成为大家争执的焦点，如处理不善，便直接影响到社员互助互利关系。当劳动报酬过高而土地报酬过低的时候，会使地多劳力少的一部分社员的收入较入社前减少；反之，当土地报酬太高而劳动报酬过低的时候，又会使劳力多土地少的一部分社员吃亏。这种偏高偏低的分配比例都是不好的。一旦出现了这种情形，就会引起内部的不团结，不但会影响已参加者，还会影响未参加者，这对合作化的发展和巩固是不利的。在处理这个极其复杂的实际问题的时候，固执片面的道理，离开社的生产发展状况和社员的思想觉悟水平，对土地报酬和劳动报酬，只强调一方而忽视另一方，只能引起事情的混乱。正确地处理的原则应当是：既要贯彻按劳分配为主的方针，又要照顾土地所有者的合理利益。我们的原则是随着生产的增长程度逐步降低土地报酬比例，提高劳动报酬比例，达到最后实现完全的按劳分配制度。生产收入增加，劳动报酬当然要相应提高。如果因土地报酬过高而影响到劳动报酬不能随着生产提高而有所增加，或虽有增加但与生产的增加不相适应，那是不对的；在这种情况下，就应该坚决地适当地降低土地报酬比例，提高劳动报酬比例。即使有个别户因为投入劳动不多，收入较少，应另行处理而不必迁就。反之，如果全社的收入不见增加或增长有限，即使降低了土地报酬并不能使劳动报酬有多大提高，反使更多社员的收入因而减少，那就不应随意降低土地报酬。有些社原定的土地报酬过低，并因此而出现了收入过分不平衡现象的时候，也要适当调整，以便于在互助互利关系的基础上团结全体社员，努力发展生产，在总收入的增加方面取得决定成绩，然后再降低土地报酬比例，逐步提高劳动报酬比例。这样继续发展下去，经过若干年，将生产提高到半倍至一倍的水平，便可以求得在大体上实现完全的按劳分配制度。现时，有些社为了争取富裕中农入社，将土地报酬提得过高；又有些社，不顾生产发展状况，为了照顾贫农利益，将土地报酬压得太低，两者都是不对的。总的要求应当是使全体入社的农民（除了入社前有部分剥削收入者以外），入社后的收入逐渐有所增加，并使一些特殊的困难户如孤寡老弱残疾等人得到特殊的照顾，使大家都见到合作的好处而踊跃参加，使共同的生产事业通畅无阻地向前发展，造成集体劳动，大量发展生产的前提。
    进行分配工作的步骤和方法，也必须切实注意。只有将它当作一个政治、经济、财务工作相互结合的综合活动，而不仅仅当作一个技术分配事务来掌握，这样才可能做好。根据以往经验，这些步骤和方法应该是：
    首先，要在秋收以前做一次试算试分。这样做有极大好处，可以避免工作中的某种盲目性（例如将个别户的问题当作一般问题，或将多数人的问题当作个别问题），夸大了或看轻了某种现象的现实意义，而使社的管理委员会能较科学地了解本社收支和各户收支状况，从这里进行进一步分析，研究全社和某些户收入减少的原因，牵扯的范围及其影响，找出症结，以便考虑制订几种分配方案。经过反复试算反复比较以后，取利避害，把事情办得更好。试算试分工作提早进行，还可以发现生产中的缺陷，警惕大家，寻求机会，争取在秋后几个月内，再努一把力，增加生产，增加收入，以为弥补。
    其次，必须结合分配进行对社员的集体主义教育。在分配工作中，总难免有些社员对某些方面的问题会有意见。其中又会有许多意见从他个人利益看是有理由的，但从全社利益看是不合理或不甚合理的，或者从明天来看是合理的而今天并不合理的；也有的在表面上看是合理的，但实际上并不合理；还有些意见是表现了农民个人利己主义心理，可以说是根本不合理的。在收益分配这样一个重大问题上，农民要斤斤计较得失，这种心理是可以理解的，完全置之不理是错误的。有了双方计较才能暴露问题，分析其合理与否，分别加以解决。但是毕竟有许多事情，是可以不计较也难以计较的，有些是计较也无用的。这些问题的最终最合理的解决，只能在大家努力劳动、发展生产、增加收入使合作事业兴盛发展的总前提之下，才能解决。遇到这种情况，必须向群众进行深入的系统的社会主义集体主义的教育，抓住具体事例，教育农民懂得个人利益和集体利益、眼前利益和长远利益的正确关系，将分配问题中某些在当时难于解决的争议，放在一个新的共同的社会主义认识基础上去解决。也就是说，不要怕农民各自计较利害，而应因势利导，引导他们从打大算盘中去解决。这样做，不但可以自然而然地解决实际问题，而且也可以提高农民的觉悟，打下解决其他问题的基础。那种将分配工作只当作一个技术工作过程，而不同时把它当作一个政治工作过程的看法，必然会把事情办坏。当然，这并不是说可以离开对实际问题的解决而去空洞地进行政治教育，那样就会陷于另一种脱离实际生活的错误。大家必须记住，合作化就是集体主义克服个人主义思想的斗争过程，这个斗争是要经过千万个具体工作步骤来完成的。我们必须利用每一个工作步骤来提高群众觉悟，使每一个工作步骤都具有丰富的政治工作内容。
    最后，必须结合分配，检查生产、检查劳动组织、改订计划。分配是过去生产的结束，又是今后努力的开端。分配会暴露那些工作不勤恳的社员的缺点，也可以揭露整个社指导生产的缺点。把缺点揭露出来，这正是改进缺点的开始。要抓住这个开始，积极努力，先在秋收前一个多月内认真去弥补。如在秋前进行土地加工，防治灾害，细心收获，加播晚熟作物等等；在秋后几个月内，进行秋耕，做好冬季生产，兴修水利，造肥积肥，经营副业等等，这些都会大大有助于以后收入的增加。各个社都有不同的增产门径，都有剩余劳力可以利用。因此，增加收入都是大有希望的。如果今年分配下来收入增加不多，就应当争取来年大大增加；如今年收入较多，就要争取来年能增加得更多。只要依靠集体力量，精益求精，充分发挥生产潜力，收入是不会不增加的。指导工作的同志如果在遇到一些困难的时候，不善于引导群众向前进，而随着群众动荡心理往后退，演变下去，所引起的后果将不只是收入能否增加的问题，而是合作社能否存在的问题。这一点对于灾区合作社来讲尤为重要。今年在灾区，被洪水淹没了不少土地，有的土地丰收，有的土地减收以至无收，将来分配收入时，争议必然会很多。在这里想找到一个使一切人都满意的解决办法是很不容易的。最公平的也是最基本的办法只能是使大家今年都能生活下去，将共同事业坚决维持下去，使生产能尽快恢复起来，争取明年丰收。因此在灾区，不仅要处理好过去生产收入的分配，而更重要的任务是如何想办法在今后增加收入。不掌握住这一点，灾区合作社的继续存在和发展就会发生问题。
    为了实现以上各点，党在指导合作社进行收益分配工作的时候，必须强调深入实际，创造典型，总结经验，及时推广。每个干部在工作中，既要注意调查研究，计算比较，又要善于掌握党的基本政策，因势利导，耐心教育群众。我们要把经济工作和政治工作结合在一起；不要盲目的事务主义，也不要空洞的说教。
