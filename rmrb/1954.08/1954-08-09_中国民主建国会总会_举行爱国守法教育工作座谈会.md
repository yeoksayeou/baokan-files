    China Democratic National Construction Association Holds Symposium on Patriotic and Law-Abiding Education

    To strengthen the patriotic and law-abiding education of its members, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a symposium on patriotic and law-abiding education from July 23rd to 28th, bringing together representatives from the Southwest District Office and nine local organizations in Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, and Guangzhou.

    The representatives attending the symposium exchanged information and experiences on conducting patriotic and law-abiding education for industrialist and merchant members. They researched and discussed the guidelines, methods, and requirements for future patriotic and law-abiding education work, reaching a common understanding.

    At the symposium, the representatives analyzed the situation of industrialist and merchant members in terms of patriotism and law-abiding since the publicity of the general task of the state's transition period. Everyone believed that after this stage of learning, some people have a relatively correct understanding of the general task of the state's transition period, and their enthusiasm for operation has increased; some people have vague understandings and many concerns; a few people even adopt negative and resistant attitudes, and the "five poisons" are not only widely discovered but also exist in varying degrees of severity. After analyzing this situation, the symposium believed that today, for industrialist and merchant members, the significance of patriotic and law-abiding education is positive and should be combined with sincere acceptance of socialist transformation and active operation, while continuing to vigorously prevent and eliminate the "five poisons" and other illegal behaviors.

    On the issue of the guiding principle of patriotic and law-abiding education, everyone believed that members should be required to ideologically draw a clear line between patriotism and law-abiding and illegality, enhance the spirit of patriotism, and strive to actively and consciously be patriotic and law-abiding, and play a leading role among industrialists and merchants. The symposium also put forward relatively clear opinions on the specific requirements for members in terms of patriotism and law-abiding, combined with the different situations of various enterprises.

    The representatives who attended the meeting all believed that this meeting solved several major problems that local organizations of the China Democratic National Construction Association had encountered in carrying out patriotic and law-abiding education work in the past and would be of great help to future work.

    中国民主建国会总会
    举行爱国守法教育工作座谈会
    中国民主建国会总会为加强对会员进行爱国守法的教育工作，曾在七月二十三日到二十八日，召集西南区办事处和北京、天津、西安、上海、南京、杭州、武汉、长沙、广州等九个地方组织的代表，举行爱国守法教育工作座谈会。
    参加座谈会的代表们交流了对工商业者会员进行爱国守法教育工作的情况和经验，对今后进行爱国守法教育工作的方针、办法和要求作了研究和讨论，取得了共同的认识。
    座谈会上，代表们分析了自从宣传国家过渡时期总任务以后，工商业者会员在爱国守法方面的情况。大家认为：经过这一阶段的学习，一部分人对国家过渡时期的总任务有了比较正确的认识，经营的积极性有所增进；一部分人认识模糊，顾虑很多；少数人甚至采取消极的和抗拒的态度，“五毒”的情况，不仅普遍有所发现，而且还存在着不同程度的严重性。座谈会分析了这种情况后，认为今天对工商业者会员来说，爱国守法教育工作的意义是积极的，应当同真诚接受社会主义改造和积极经营结合起来，同时要继续大力预防和清除“五毒”及其他违法行为。
    在爱国守法教育工作方针问题上，大家认为应该要求会员在思想上划清爱国守法和违法界限，提高爱国主义精神，努力做到积极地自觉地爱国守法，并在工商界中发挥骨干带头作用。对会员在爱国守法方面的具体要求，座谈会也结合了各企业的不同情况提出了比较明确的意见。
    参加会议的代表，都认为这次会议解决了过去民主建国会地方组织在进行爱国守法教育工作中的若干主要问题，对今后工作会有较大的帮助。
