(By our Fuzhou correspondent, August 28th) The people of the coastal fishing villages of Fujian, who have suffered from the harassment and looting by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched on Jinmen Island in Taiwan for several years, warmly support the joint declaration on the liberation of Taiwan. Many fishermen's families have come forward to denounce the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

    The husband and two sons of the fisherwoman Zhang Yazhao were driven into the sea and drowned by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the past; another son was captured and forced to serve as cannon fodder. At a discussion meeting held by the fishermen, she tearfully denounced: "The Chiang Kai-shek bandits have ruined my family, and the grievances have not been avenged. The People's Liberation Army is going to liberate Taiwan, which can avenge my family. Only by liberating Taiwan can the lives of fishermen be better."

    Many fishermen on the islands rushed back to the mainland to inquire about the news of the liberation of Taiwan. They asked: How many ships are needed to support the liberation of Taiwan? How many people are needed? How many stretchers are needed? The fishermen said: We must be ready for all kinds of sea-crossing preparations at any time. We will have them whenever they are needed. The 131 boatmen of Houlin Village, Dongshan Island, which is close to the Bachimen ferry, immediately put forward the slogan of "fast concentration, fast loading and unloading, fast rowing" and "three fears not" (not afraid of bullets, not afraid of wind and rain, not afraid of difficulties) after discussing the joint declaration, ready to respond to the call at any time.

    Lin Dafu, a militiaman and first-class meritorious person who captured a heavy machine gun from an enemy paratrooper with a kitchen knife in the Dongshan battle last year, said: "Hearing that we are going to liberate Taiwan, I can't suppress my excitement. I want to be the first to sign up to support the liberation of Taiwan and resolutely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang."

    Meigang in Jinjiang County, facing Jinmen Island occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek army, is the place where the national hero Zheng Chenggong sailed to Taiwan at the end of the Ming Dynasty. To this day, the people of Meigang have always been proud that their ancestors supported Zheng Chenggong in crossing the sea. The fishermen of Meigang said: "Taiwan has been our territory since ancient times, and we must liberate Taiwan. Our ancestors supported Zheng Chenggong, and we must also support the People's Liberation Army. As soon as the order to liberate Taiwan is issued, we will provide ships if needed and people if needed. All our fishermen will set sail with their boats to ferry the People's Liberation Army across the sea and capture the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek alive." The militia of the whole town of Yongning Town, Jinjiang, expressed their intention to sign up to participate in the work of supporting the liberation of Taiwan. In addition to deciding to continue strengthening the coastal defense sentry posts and guarding the warehouses, the militia backbone company also draws a shift of militia every night to support the sentry posts in neighboring villages.

    福建沿海渔民决心支援解放台湾
    他们随时准备带船出发，送解放军渡海
    【本报福州二十八日电】几年来饱受窃踞台湾金门岛蒋匪骚扰和抢劫痛苦的福建沿海渔乡人民热烈拥护解放台湾联合宣言，许多渔民家属都纷纷控诉蒋匪罪行。
    渔妇张亚招的丈夫和两个儿子过去被蒋匪赶下海淹死；她的另一儿子被抓去当了炮灰。在渔民们举行的讨论会上，她流泪控诉道：“蒋贼害得我家破人亡，冤仇没有报，解放军要解放台湾，可给我一家报冤仇了。只有解放台湾，渔家的日子才能好过。”
    许多岛屿上的渔民赶回大陆打听解放台湾的消息，他们问：支援解放台湾，要多少条船？要多少人？要多少副担架？渔民们说：我们一定要随时做好各种渡海准备，什么时候要，什么时候有。紧靠八尺门渡口的东山岛后林村的一百三十一位船工讨论了联合宣言后，立刻提出“集中快、装卸快、划桨快”和不怕枪林弹雨、不怕风雨、不怕困难的三快三不怕口号，随时响应号召。
    去年东山战斗中以一把菜刀缴获敌伞兵一挺重机枪的民兵、一等功臣林大富说：“听了要解放台湾，我压不住心头高兴。我要争取第一个报名支援解放台湾，坚决消灭蒋介石匪帮。”
    面对蒋匪军盘踞的金门岛的晋江县梅港，是明末民族英雄郑成功东渡台湾出海的地方，至今梅港人民一直以自己的祖先曾支援过郑成功渡海感到骄傲。梅港的渔民们说：“台湾自古以来就是我国的领土，我们一定要解放台湾。我们的祖先支援过郑成功，我们也一定要支援人民解放军。解放台湾命令一下，要船有船，要人有人，我们全体渔民带船出发，送解放军渡海，活捉人民公敌蒋介石。”晋江永宁镇全镇民兵表示要报名参加支援解放台湾工作，民兵基干连除决定继续加强海防站岗放哨和保卫仓库工作外，每晚还另抽出一班民兵支援邻乡岗哨。
