　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 12th - Hague dispatch: The Indonesian-Dutch negotiations, which began in The Hague on June 29th, have reached an agreement to dissolve the Netherlands-Indonesia Union. The protocol ending this federal relationship was signed on the 10th in The Hague by the head of the Indonesian delegation, Sunarjo, and the head of the Dutch delegation, Luns.
    The news stated that the protocol stipulates that the 1949 agreement on cooperation between the Netherlands and Indonesia in diplomatic and defense affairs and the 1949 cultural agreement would be abolished along with the federal relationship. However, there are separate provisions for financial and economic agreements, in which some clauses concerning Dutch rights, concessions, licenses, business rights in Indonesia, and the transfer of property will be retained. The clauses on debt remain valid.
    Indonesia's recovery of the West Irian issue remains unresolved. Sunarjo said in a speech after the signing that Indonesia felt "very regrettable" about the Netherlands' consistent unwillingness to discuss the West Irian issue and lodged a protest. Luns said in a speech that the Netherlands and Indonesia had "irreconcilable differences" regarding the status of western New Guinea (West Irian). It is generally known that many reports indicate that West Irian, under Dutch occupation, is becoming a military base in the US plan to invade Southeast Asia.

　　印尼和荷兰达成协议解散荷兰—印尼联邦
    但是荷兰仍保留财政经济权利并拒绝谈判西伊里安问题
    【新华社雅加达十二日电】海牙消息，从六月二十九日开始在海牙举行的印（尼）荷谈判，达成了解散荷兰—印尼联邦的协议。结束这一联邦关系的议定书已经于十日由印尼代表团团长苏纳约和荷兰代表团团长伦斯在海牙签字。
    消息说，议定书规定，一九四九年签订的关于荷兰和印尼在外交事务和防御事务合作的协定和一九四九年文化协定，都同联邦的关系一起加以废除。但是，关于财政与经济协定另有规定，其中关于荷兰在印尼的权利、租让权、执照、企业经营权的一些条文以及关于财产转移问题的条文都将保留。关于债务方面的条文继续有效。
    印尼收回西伊里安问题还得不到解决。苏纳约在签字后发表的演说中说，印尼对于荷兰一直不愿讨论西伊里安问题感到“非常遗憾”，并提出了抗议。伦斯在演说中表示，荷兰对新畿内亚西部（西伊里安）地位问题的意见和印尼存在着“不能调和的分歧”。大家知道，许多消息表明，荷兰占领下的西伊里安正在成为美国侵略东南亚计划中的军事基地。
