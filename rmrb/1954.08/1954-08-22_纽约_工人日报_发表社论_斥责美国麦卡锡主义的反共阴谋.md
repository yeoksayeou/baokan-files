Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 21st:

    The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 16th, denouncing the McCarthyist anti-communist conspiracy, after the U.S. Senate passed a bill declaring the Communist Party illegal.
    The editorial said: The U.S. Senate's step of declaring the Communist Party illegal foreshadows the dying anti-democratic forces in modern history attempting to "solve" their domestic problems by using totalitarian means to suppress all political criticism and organized opposition.
    The editorial said: Why does the U.S. Senate feel it is urgently necessary to declare a Marxist party with a thirty-five-year history illegal on the eve of the 1954 congressional elections? The answer can be found in the economic and social realities that hysterical senators are trying to hide from the American people.
    The editorial continued: The McCarthy forces, who attempted to wage an American war against Indochina and China in Asia, have just suffered a disastrous defeat. They are now watching with hatred and war-mongering anger as the British Labour Party travels to Moscow and Beijing to seek peaceful coexistence, while the British Parliament also agrees to the Soviet Parliament's invitation to visit.
    Washington's diplomatic policy of "no peace with communism" while rearming Hitler's Nazis is increasingly rejected by Western Europe and all of humanity. The McCarthyites are very worried about the rise of a nationwide movement in the United States demanding that Washington change its war policy to a policy of promoting world peace and trade through negotiation. They want to stifle this demand for peace by raising new cries against "communists."
    The editorial said: Furthermore, the senators are afraid of a moment they have already seen looming ahead: as economic crisis factors increase, labor unions, farmers, and "little people" will more fiercely oppose big business on the economic front.
    The editorial said: Clear-headed Americans still have time to stop the hysterical and reactionary actions of those who are frightened and helpless in a world moving towards peaceful coexistence.
    The editorial said: Persecuting communists will not provide even the slightest solution to the increasingly serious problems of workers, farmers, and the nation. Communist social thought cannot be imprisoned. What is needed now is for the people of the whole country to awaken and oppose the demons of the McCarthy ilk.

    纽约“工人日报”发表社论
    斥责美国麦卡锡主义的反共阴谋
    【新华社柏林二十一日电】在美国参议院通过宣布共产党为非法的议案以后，纽约“工人日报”十六日发表社论，斥责麦卡锡主义的反共阴谋。
    社论说：美国参议院通过采取宣布共产党非法的步骤，预示了在现代历史上垂死挣扎的反民主势力力图用压制一切政治批评和有组织的反对的极权主义手段来“解决”本国问题。
    社论说：美国参议院为什么觉得迫切需要在一九五四年国会选举前夕宣布一个已有三十五年历史的马克思主义政党非法呢？从歇斯底里的参议员们力图在美国人民面前掩盖的经济和社会现实中就可以找到答案。
    社论接着说：企图在亚洲对印度支那和中国进行一场美国战争的麦卡锡势力刚刚遭到惨重的失败。他们现在以憎恨和渴望战争的愤怒心情注视着英国工党前往莫斯科和北京谋求和平共处，同时英国议会也同意苏联议会的访问邀请。
    华盛顿采取的“不跟共产主义讲和平”，同时又重新武装希特勒纳粹的外交政策日益受到西欧和全人类的唾弃。麦卡锡分子非常担心在美国全国范围内掀起要求华盛顿把战争方针改变为以协商促进世界和平和贸易的方针的运动。他们想以反对“共产党人”的新叫嚣来扼杀这种和平要求。
    社论说：此外，参议员们害怕已经看到的在前面隐约出现的这样一个时刻：随着经济危机因素的增加，工会、农民和“小人物”将在经济阵线上更猛烈地反对大企业。
    社论说：头脑清楚的美国人仍然还来得及制止那些在向着和平共处前进的世界里被吓得手足无措的人们的歇斯底里的反动行动。
    社论说：迫害共产党人并不能使工人、农民与国家的日益严重的问题多有一点点解决办法。共产党人的社会思想是不能禁锢的。现在所需要的是全国人民觉醒起来，反对麦卡锡之流的妖魔。
