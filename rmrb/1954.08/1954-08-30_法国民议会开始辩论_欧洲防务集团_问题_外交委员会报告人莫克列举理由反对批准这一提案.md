Xinhua News Agency, Paris: According to a TASS report, August 28th marked the beginning of the French National Assembly's debate on the "European Defense Community" issue. From early morning, a particularly large crowd gathered around the National Assembly building. Delegations of French working people arrived continuously, distributing resolutions and appeals opposing the arming of West Germany under the guise of the "European Defense Community" to the members of parliament. Many citizens waited for the opportunity to enter the National Assembly hall to observe the proceedings.

A few hours before the meeting, intense activity continued in the National Assembly lounge. Supporters of the "European Defense Community" did everything possible to postpone the discussion. Many suggestions were put forward, all aimed at disrupting the debate and voting. "Independent Republican" Hommeyran suggested first discussing whether it was appropriate to begin the debate now; Chauvin, a member of the right-wing "Democratic Social Resistance Union," proposed postponing the debate until "more comprehensive information is obtained"; "Independent Republican" Delbez suggested that the government "make another effort to reach an agreement with the five countries before September 20th." All these suggestions were to be discussed after the rapporteurs of the various committees reported, and before the debate began.

The National Assembly meeting opened at 3 p.m. local time. The first speaker was Jules Moch, the rapporteur of the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee.

Moch reminded the parliamentarians that the current form of the "European Defense Community" treaty was vastly different from the original draft proposed by France in 1950. The original suggestion stipulated the establishment of "small units of each country—battalions or detachments" to form the "European Army." Now, however, German divisions are allowed to join the "European Army," which effectively means allowing West Germany to establish a war ministry and general staff headquarters, and recognizing West Germany's ability to build a national army with corps-level formations. Britain and the Scandinavian countries have refused to participate in the Paris Treaty.

Moch then emphasized that the "European Defense Community" treaty contradicts the fundamental provisions of the Constitution of the French Republic, and that the treaty greatly restricts national sovereignty. If this treaty is implemented, it would mean that the French parliament would be deprived of such important powers as deciding the term of military service, the number of troops, the standard of military pay, and military expenditures. The Minister of Foreign Affairs would also lose the power to negotiate France's foreign aid. On issues falling within the scope of the leadership bodies of this "Community," the Minister of Foreign Affairs would also lose the power to maintain contact with countries not participating in the "European Defense Community." The powers of the President of the Republic and the Minister of Defense and Armed Forces stipulated in the Constitution would also be impaired.

Moch said that the current form of the "European Defense Community" treaty violates the Franco-Soviet Treaty signed in Moscow in 1944, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Agreement, and even violates the agreement signed by the Western countries in London in 1947, because these treaties and agreements stipulated the complete disarmament of Germany and the eradication of German militarism.

Moch said: This treaty establishes discriminatory attitudes detrimental to France: If the national armies of five countries are abolished, while the sixth country establishes an army, can this be said to be equal? If the functions of the ministries of defense and general staffs of five countries are weakened, while the sixth country establishes a ministry of defense and general staff, is this also equal? Moch also said: Once this treaty is implemented, West Germany will immediately gain an advantage over France, and West Germany's armed forces will exceed France's by one or two times.

Moch pointed out that since the treaty draft was drawn up, international tensions have been easing. He hoped that the contacts established in Berlin and Geneva and the negotiations on disarmament would "bear fruit." He believed that it was necessary to enable "the two worlds to coexist and no longer ignore each other."

Moch said to the parliamentarians: "The matter is this: either you are in favor of the European Defense Community, in which case you no longer need to participate in the work of the (United Nations) Disarmament Committee, because it is already useless, and you will be faced with unrestrained arms expansion; or you take into account the progress in easing tensions and refuse any form of arming of West Germany, and carefully study disarmament methods."

Moch then clearly hinted at American pressure on France. He said: "I have not forgotten that the outcome of the parliamentary vote will cause disappointment to France's allies. But can the clearly expressed opinion of France be ignored? Now everyone is talking about arming Germany through bilateral agreements or by allowing Germany to enter the Atlantic Alliance... But the allies cannot take such a decision without France's consent."

Moch said that the conclusion of the Foreign Affairs Committee he represents is that the proposal to approve the "European Defense Community" treaty must be rejected.

    法国民议会开始辩论“欧洲防务集团”问题
    外交委员会报告人莫克列举理由反对批准这一提案
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：二十八日是法国国民议会开始辩论“欧洲防务集团”问题的日子。这一天，从清晨起，国民议会大厦周围就聚集了特别多的人。法国劳动人民的代表团源源不断地来到，把反对在“欧洲防务集团”的幌子下武装西德的决议和呼吁书分发给议员们。许多公民等待机会进入国民议会会议厅旁听。
    开会前几小时，在国民议会休息室，紧张的活动在继续进行着。“欧洲防务集团”的拥护者尽一切力量争取延期讨论。已经提出了许多建议，目的都是想破坏辩论和表决。“独立共和党人”奥麦朗建议首先讨论现在开始辩论是否适宜的问题；右翼政党“民主社会抵抗联盟”的盟员舒邦提议延期辩论，直到“获得更加全面的消息”时为止；“独立共和党人”德尔贝斯建议政府“再作一次努力，争取在九月二十日以前和五国达成协议”。所有这些建议都要在各委员会报告人报告之后、辩论开始之前加以讨论。
    国民议会会议在当地时间下午三时开幕。第一个发言的是国民议会外交委员会报告人儒勒·莫克。
    莫克提醒议员们注意：“欧洲防务集团”条约的现有形式和一九五零年法国所提出的最初草案已经大不相同。当时的建议规定，建立“各国的小部队——营或支队”来组成“欧洲军”。现在却准许德国师加入“欧洲军”，实际上就是准许西德建立战争部和参谋总部，承认西德可以建立起有兵团规模的国家军。英国和斯堪的纳维亚国家都拒绝参加巴黎条约。
    莫克接着着重指出：“欧洲防务集团”条约是和法兰西共和国宪法的基本条款抵触的，这个条约大大限制国家主权。如果这个条约实现了，就等于说：法国议会要被剥夺这样一些重要的权力，如决定兵役期限、军队人数、军人薪俸标准、军费开支等。外交部部长也要丧失就法国的外援进行谈判的权力。在属于这个“集团”的领导机构的权力范围之内的问题上，外交部长也丧失了和不参加“欧洲防务集团”国家保持联系的权力。宪法上规定的共和国总统和国防和武装部队部部长的权力也受到损害。
    莫克说：现有形式的“欧洲防务集团”条约违反一九四四年在莫斯科签订的法苏条约、雅尔塔协定和波茨坦协定，甚至违反一九四七年西方国家在伦敦签订的协定，因为这些条约和协定都规定了要完全解除德国武装和肃清德国军国主义。
    莫克说：这个条约确定了有害于法国的歧视态度：如果五个国家的国家军都消灭了，而第六个国家却建立起军队来，这难道可以说是平等的吗？如果五个国家的国防部和参谋总部的职权都受到削弱，而第六个国家却建立起了国防部和参谋总部，这难道又是平等的吗？莫克还说：这个条约一旦实现，西德立刻就取得对法国的优势，西德的武装力量也会超过法国的力量一倍、两倍。
    莫克指出：从条约草案拟定时起，国际紧张局势一直在缓和下来。他希望在柏林和日内瓦建立的接触以及关于裁军的谈判会“取得成果”。他认为必须使“两个世界共处，再也不能互相不理睬了”。
    莫克向议员们说道：“事情就是这样：你们或者是赞成欧洲防务集团，那就不用再参加（联合国）裁军委员会的工作，因为它已经毫无用处了，这样，你们面对着的将是不可抑制的扩军；或者是你们考虑到在缓和紧张局势方面有进展而拒绝对西德进行任何形式的武装，并且仔细研究裁军的办法。”
    莫克接着明显地暗示美国对法国的压力。他说：“我并没有忘记：议会投票结果会引起法国盟国的失望。但是，难道能忽视法国明确表示的意见吗？现在大家在谈论要以双边协定或是德国进入大西洋联盟的办法来武装德国……但是，盟国不能没有得到法国的同意就采取这样的决定。”
    莫克说，他所代表的外交委员会的结论是：必须拒绝关于批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的提案。
