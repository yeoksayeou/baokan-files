Since the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Provisional Organizational Regulations for People's Mediation Committees," people's mediation organizations have greatly developed in various regions. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 90,000 people's mediation committees nationwide.

Many places have adopted a steady approach in developing people's mediation organizations. Based on the actual situation, they have conducted key experiments under leadership and with planning, and then established them in batches. Some areas, during the anti-"Five Excesses" campaign last year, regarded people's mediation committees as redundant organizations and abolished them all or merged them into other organizations. Other mediation organizations collapsed due to lack of leadership. The regions that had no mediation organizations due to these reasons have now re-established mediation organizations. In order to further leverage the role of mediation organizations, various regions have systematically rectified the mediation organizations that were not functioning well. In the past, some mediation organizations were impure, controlled by a few bad elements. These were re-elected during this rectification, and active individuals who were loyal, reliable, able to connect with the masses, and enthusiastic and responsible were appointed as mediation committee members. In the past, some mediation organizations had unsound working systems, and some mediation committee members had low levels of policy and professional skills, and were not clear enough about the nature, tasks, and powers of mediation organizations. During this development and rectification of mediation organizations, these mediation organizations and committee members received a lot of help. Many county people's courts in Zhejiang Province used the opportunity of circuit courts working in the countryside to improve the policy and professional level of mediation committee members by organizing mediation committee members to have discussions, participate in hearings or trials through typical cases, and helped mediation organizations establish systems for meetings, reports, and registration. Many county people's courts also held mediation work conferences, as well as organized mediation committee members to conduct short-term studies or key inspections, to improve the business ability of mediation committee members and enhance their confidence in their work.

    各地人民调解组织有了很大的发展
    自从中央人民政府政务院颁布“人民调解委员会暂行组织通则”以后，各地人民调解组织有了很大的发展。据不完全统计，目前全国已有九万多个人民调解委员会。
    许多地方在发展人民调解组织中，采取稳步前进的方针，根据实际情况，有领导、有计划地先经重点试验，然后分批建立。有些地区在去年反“五多”时，曾经把人民调解委员会当成多余的组织，一律取消或并入其他组织；还有些调解组织因缺乏领导垮台了，因这些原因，而没有调解组织的地区这次都重新建立起来了调解组织。为了进一步发挥调解组织的作用，各地对不大起作用的调解组织，有步骤地进行了整顿。过去有些调解组织由于组织不纯，为少数坏分子掌握，在这次整顿中进行了改选，由忠诚可靠、能联系群众、热情负责的积极分子担任调解委员。过去有些调解组织工作制度不健全，有些调解委员的政策和业务水平不高，对调解组织的性质、任务、职权等不够明确，在这次发展和整顿调解组织中，对这些调解组织和委员都给了很多帮助。浙江省许多县人民法院利用巡回法庭在乡下工作的机会，通过典型案件，组织调解委员座谈、参加旁听或审讯等方法提高了调解委员政策和业务水平，并帮助调解组织建立了会议、汇报、登记等制度。许多县人民法院还召开了调解工作会议，以及组织调解委员进行短期学习或重点检查等方法，提高调解委员的业务能力，增强了他们的工作信心。（新华社）
