Hubei and Hunan Provinces Take Effective Measures to Properly Resettle and Help Disaster Victims to Restore Production

Xinhua News Agency

Most of the disaster victims in the flood-stricken areas of Hubei Province have been resettled in safe areas, and a small number of disaster victims are also being rapidly transferred in an organized manner. The Communist Party Committees and People's Governments at all levels in Hubei Province have taken urgent and effective measures to properly resettle disaster victims; dispatched ships to rescue disaster victims surrounded by floods, and rapidly transferred disaster victims to safe areas in a planned manner. Grain, banking, supply and marketing cooperatives, and health departments have set up temporary institutions in areas with disaster victims to solve problems such as food, accommodation, and disease for disaster victims. In areas severely affected by the disaster, the local people's governments have distributed relief funds and food rations. Jingjiang County has specially set up 30 supply and marketing stations to supply disaster victims with daily necessities such as grain, fuel, and vegetables. In order to strive for immediate production after the flood recedes, appropriate arrangements have also been made for draught cattle and agricultural tools in various disaster areas. In addition to entrusting the unaffected agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, or relatives and friends of the disaster victims to take care of the draught cattle, the remaining cattle are organized by the disaster victims to graze elsewhere.

Cadres and people in safe areas warmly welcome the disaster victims who have been transferred. These areas have established disaster victim transfer and resettlement committees, and set up reception stations, supply stations, and medical teams along the way to serve the disaster victims. Jingmen County also organized people's comfort teams from all walks of life to welcome and comfort the disaster victims along the way, and put forward the slogan of "Unite and Help Each Other to Overcome the Disaster." When the disaster victims arrive, cadres and farmers enthusiastically help carry things, support the elderly and hold children, deliver firewood and water, and build houses. The disaster victims expressed their infinite gratitude for such kind care and help from the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the people in non-disaster areas. The disaster victims who have moved to safe areas are currently actively carrying out various production activities in order to overcome the disaster victoriously under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government.

The Hubei Provincial People's Government has allocated more than 50 billion yuan in relief funds to help disaster victims settle down and resume production. After receiving the relief funds, the disaster victims in Buwan Township, Mianyang County, not only solved the difficulty of food rations, but also carried out sideline production such as net making and fishing. The masses in the disaster areas expressed their gratitude for the timely distribution of relief funds by the People's Government.

The people in the flood-stricken areas of Hunan Province have generally been properly resettled. Since the beginning of summer, Hunan Province has experienced erratic weather. By mid-July, there had been more than ten heavy rainfalls, causing waterlogging in some areas. Thanks to the efforts of party and government organs at all levels in dispatching a large number of cadres to lead the masses in flood prevention and rescue, a part of the embankment was protected. In order to prevent floods and protect embankments, Yueyang County dispatched 1,719 people to lead the masses in rescue operations, and dispatched 331 boats and 698 wooden rafts. Leading cadres of party and government at all levels and the masses fought against the floods day and night, regardless of fatigue. All flood control personnel were divided into sections to defend, and dangerous areas were protected by driving wooden stakes, placing sacks, laying straw, blocking wooden boards, throwing quilts, and padding mats to reduce the impact of waves on the embankment. Some embankments were breached several times, but they were all blocked. In the areas severely affected by the disaster, the People's Government has planned and organized the transfer of a part of the disaster victims, so that they can be properly resettled. Xiangyin and Wangcheng counties organized more than 20 steamships and more than 1,000 wooden boats to transport disaster victims in batches by region. After entering the resettlement area, in order to reduce the difficulties of the disaster victims on the road, tea stations and medical stations were set up along the road, and some people were sent to help the disaster victims carry things. In the thirteenth district of Xiangyin County, six medical stations and nine tea stations were set up along the way, and more than 30 people from each township welcomed the disaster victims. The Secretary of the District Party Committee, the District Head, and many cadres led the work of resettling the disaster victims day and night, and personally carried burdens for the disaster victims, which motivated the masses and moved the disaster victims. At present, the disaster victims in various places have generally been properly resettled.

Since June, the Hunan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China has issued more than 65 billion yuan in loans to help farmers in flood-stricken areas carry out production for self-salvation. This loan is mainly used to purchase seeds and fertilizers. The farmers in Qianjiang Township, the 16th District of Xiangyin County, used bank loans to buy dozens of dan of rice seedlings, and planted late rice on more than 3,400 mu of disaster-stricken fields in the township. Some farmers in the Dongting Lake area used bank loans to add fishing nets and carry out sideline production such as fishing.

    湖北湖南两省采取有效措施
    妥善安置灾民帮助灾民生产自救
    湖北省水灾地区大部灾民都已安置到安全区，少数灾民也在有组织地迅速转移中。中共湖北省各级党委和人民政府对妥善安置灾民，采取了紧急有效措施；派出船只抢救了被洪水包围的灾民，有计划地迅速转移灾民到安全区。粮食、银行、供销合作社和医疗卫生等部门，在有灾民的地区设立了临时机构，为灾民解决口粮、住宿、疾病等困难。受灾较重地区，都由当地人民政府发放了救济款和口粮。荆江县专门设立了三十个供销站，为灾民供应粮食、燃料、菜蔬等日用品。为争取在洪水退后立即进行生产，灾区各地对耕牛、农具也都作了适当安顿。耕牛除了委托未受灾的农业生产合作社、互助组或灾民亲戚朋友代养，其余的都由灾民推派专人，组织起来到外地放牧。
    安全地区的干部和人民都热情地欢迎转移去的灾民。这些地区都成立了灾民转移安置委员会，沿途设立了接待站、供应站、医疗队为灾民服务。荆门县还组织了各界人民慰问队，沿途欢迎慰问灾民，提出“团结互助渡过灾荒”的口号。灾民到达时，干部和农民热情地帮助挑东西，扶老人抱小孩，送柴送水，安家盖屋。灾民们对共产党、人民政府和非灾区人民这样亲切的关怀帮助表示无限感激。已迁到安全地区的灾民，目前正在积极开展各种生产活动，以便在共产党和人民政府领导下，胜利渡过灾荒。　（新华社）×××
    湖北省人民政府拨了救济款五百多亿元，帮助灾民安家生产。沔阳县埠湾乡灾民得到救济款后，不仅解决了口粮的困难，还进行了制网捕鱼等副业生产。灾区群众对于人民政府及时的发放救济款，一致表示感激。×××
    湖南省遭受水灾地区人民已普遍得到适当安置。湖南省从入夏以来，气候变化无常。到七月中旬，先后降暴雨十多次，部分地区积水成灾。由于各级党政机关抽调大批干部领导群众防汛抢险，保住了一部分垸堤。岳阳县为了防汛保堤，曾出动一千七百一十九人领导群众抢险，并出动了三百三十一只船和六百九十八个木簰。各级党政领导干部和群众一道，泥里来，水里去，不分昼夜，不顾疲劳地和洪水搏斗。全体防汛人员分段防守，危险处以打木桩、放麻袋、铺稻草、挡木板、抛被子、垫席子等办法减少波浪对堤身的冲击。有些堤段决口几次，都给堵住。在灾情较重地区，人民政府有计划有组织地转移了一部分灾民，使他们得到妥善安置。湘阴、望城两县组织了轮船二十多只和木船一千多只，分区分批地运送灾民。进入安置地区后，为了减少灾民在路上的困难，沿路设立了茶水站、医疗站，并出动一些人帮助灾民担东西。湘阴县第十三区，在沿途设立了六个医疗站和九个茶水站，各乡都有三十多个人迎接灾民。中共区委书记、区长和很多干部，都不分昼夜地领导安置灾民的工作，并亲自给灾民挑担子，带动了群众，也感动了灾民。目前，各地灾民已普遍得到适当安置。

    中国人民银行湖南省分行自六月份以来，已发放六百五十多亿元贷款，帮助水灾地区的农民进行生产自救。这笔贷款主要用作购买种籽和肥料。湘阴县十六区仟江乡农民，用银行贷款买了数十担秧苗，把全乡三千四百多亩受灾田都插上了晚稻。洞庭湖滨有些农民用银行贷款添制渔网，进行捕鱼等副业生产。　（新华社）
