    The First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Shaanxi Province Concludes:
    Defines Future Work Guidelines and Elects New Provincial Committee
    The First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Shaanxi Province was held from June 21st to 31st. A total of 416 delegates attended the congress, with 106 observers.
    In accordance with the spirit of the Party's General Line during the Transition Period and the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the congress, adopting the spirit of broadly promoting democracy and conducting criticism and self-criticism, reviewed and summarized the work since the Party Representative Conference held in July 1950. Based on the Central Committee's decision to abolish the Greater Administrative Regions and incorporate Xi'an into Shaanxi Province, the congress discussed and defined the guidelines and tasks for future work.
    The congress held that, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Party organizations in Shaanxi have, over the past four years, led the people of the province in carrying out great social reforms, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and restoring and transforming the economy, achieving great success. After entering planned economic construction in 1953, they actively supported the construction of industrial projects, basically completed the tasks of the first year of the first Five-Year Plan, and began to conduct socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in a planned and systematic manner. The shortcomings in the work were: the Provincial Committee did not conduct sufficient specific organization and inspection in implementing the Party's policies and resolutions; it did not pay enough attention to the special circumstances of various regions in guiding agriculture. Some prefectural and many county committees did not adequately implement the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao to shift the focus of leadership to mutual aid and cooperation. Among some rural cadres, there were still phenomena of coercion, commandism, and violation of laws and regulations.
    The congress focused on discussing the issue of strengthening the Party's leadership over socialist industrial construction and the socialist transformation of agriculture. The congress believed that the Party committees should currently focus on supervising and supporting the large-scale industrial infrastructure construction and the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. At the same time, they should do a good job in mineral exploration and the construction, expansion, and renovation of local industries; strengthen the leadership of production in existing factories and mines, and ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion and strive to overfulfill the state plan; continue to select strong cadres to enrich the leading backbone of industrial construction, educate and help all Party member cadres transferred to industrial construction to study diligently and gradually become experts in leading and managing enterprise production, and pay attention to cultivating and promoting outstanding worker cadres; establish provincial committees to manage industrial organizations as soon as possible, and the Party committee should regularly discuss and inspect industrial construction work; strengthen and improve political and ideological work in factories, mines, and infrastructure construction.
    Regarding the socialist transformation of agriculture, the congress believed that it is currently necessary to fully develop an agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas. On the basis of continuing to develop and improve mutual aid teams, actively, systematically, and with leadership, develop agricultural producers' cooperatives and help the great development of mutual aid teams. Educate farmers to establish the idea of ​​comprehensively increasing production, and continue to increase the output of grain, cotton, oilseeds, and other agricultural products to support industrial construction and adapt to the needs of continuously improving people's living standards. Local Party committees and county Party committees must quickly and resolutely shift the focus of leadership to the mutual aid and cooperation movement, regularly discuss mutual aid and cooperation; the Party committee secretary must personally take action, go deep down, provide specific leadership, and gain experience; strengthen the political and ideological leadership of Party branches in rural areas over mutual aid and cooperation organizations, so that Party branches in rural areas truly become combat fortresses for leading the socialist transformation of agriculture.
    The congress pointed out that while strengthening the Party's leadership over industrial construction and the socialist transformation of agriculture, it is also necessary to pay attention to strengthening market management; developing supply and marketing cooperation, credit cooperation, and handicraft cooperation; gradually expanding organized markets; actively carrying out the socialist transformation of private capitalist industry and commerce; and doing a good job in the unified purchase and sale of major agricultural products and the purchase of other products.
    In order to successfully complete the above tasks, the congress made principled provisions on further implementing the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee, enhancing Party unity, and strengthening Party ideological and organizational construction. The congress called on all Party members to unite as one, constantly maintain a humble and prudent work style, closely connect with the masses, and, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, successfully complete various tasks and steadily advance the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. The congress finally elected 37 full members and 10 alternate members of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    中国共产党陕西省第一次代表大会闭幕
    讨论确定了今后工作的方针任务并选举了新的省委会
    中国共产党陕西省第一次代表大会已在六月二十一日到三十一日举行。出席大会的代表共四百一十六人，列席一百零六人。
    大会根据党在过渡时期总路线和党的七届四中全会决议的精神，采取广泛发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评的精神，检查总结了一九五零年七月举行党代表会议以来的工作，并根据中央关于撤销大区机构和将西安市并入陕西省建制的决定，讨论确定了今后工作的方针和任务。
    大会认为：陕西地区党的组织，在党中央的正确领导下，四年来领导全省人民进行伟大的社会改革、抗美援朝和经济的恢复及改造工作，获得很大成绩。一九五三年进入有计划的经济建设之后，积极地支援了工业的兴建工程，基本上完成了第一个五年计划第一年度任务，开始有计划、有系统地对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造。工作中存在的缺点是：省委在贯彻执行党的政策决议中，具体组织检查不够；对农业的指导方面照顾各地区的特殊情况不够。有些地委和不少县委，对中央和毛主席把领导重心转向互助合作方面的指示贯彻不够，部分乡村干部中，还存在着强迫命令、违法乱纪的现象。
    大会着重讨论了关于加强党对社会主义工业建设和农业的社会主义改造的领导问题。大会认为：目前党委首先应抓紧对大工业基本建设和宝成铁路修筑工程的监督和支援工作，同时做好矿藏的勘探和地方工业的兴建、扩建和改建工作；加强对现有厂矿企业生产的领导，保证全面均衡地完成和争取超额完成国家计划；继续抽派坚强干部，充实工业建设的领导骨干，教育和帮助所有转入工业建设的党员干部，刻苦钻研、逐步成为领导和管理企业生产的内行，并注意培养和提拔优秀的工人干部；尽速建立省委管理工业的组织机构，党委会应定期讨论、检查工业建设工作；加强和改进厂矿、基本建设中的政治思想工作。
    关于农业的社会主义改造问题，大会认为：目前在农村中必须全力开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。在继续发展提高互助组的基础上，积极地、有计划有领导地发展农业生产合作社，并帮助互助组的大发展。教育农民树立全面增产的思想，继续提高粮食、棉花、油料和其他农产品的产量，以支援工业建设和适应人民生活水平不断提高的需要。各地委、县委必须迅速坚决地把领导重心转到互助合作运动方面来，定期讨论互助合作；党委书记必须亲自动手，深入下去，具体领导，取得经验；加强农村中的党支部对互助合作组织的政治思想领导，使农村中党的支部真正成为领导农业的社会主义改造的战斗堡垒。
    大会指出：在加强党对工业建设和农业的社会主义改造的领导同时，还必须注意加强市场管理；发展供销合作、信用合作和手工业合作事业；逐步扩大有组织的市场；积极进行对私人资本主义工商业的社会主义改造；做好主要农产品的统购统销和其他产品的收购工作等。
    为了胜利地完成上述任务，大会对进一步贯彻党的四中全会决议，增强党的团结，加强党的思想建设和组织建设等问题，都作了原则的规定。大会号召全体党员团结一致，经常保持谦虚谨慎的作风，密切联系群众，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，胜利地完成各项任务，把社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业稳步地推向前进，大会最后选举了中共陕西省委员会正式委员三十七人，候补委员十人。
