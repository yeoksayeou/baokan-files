    More Than 2,600 University Graduates
    Participate in the Construction of the Motherland's Northwest Region
    In the various construction posts in the Northwest region, 2,678 graduates from universities across the country this summer will participate in the work. Currently, most of these graduates have arrived at their work locations in various provinces and cities and are about to contribute their strength to the construction of the motherland.
    This summer, a total of 1,852 students graduated from universities in the Northwest region, of which 628 were assigned to work in various central departments and other major administrative regions, and 1,224 remained in the region to participate in work. In order to meet the needs of national construction, 1,454 graduates were transferred from universities across the country to work in the Northwest. Of this group of construction talents, 1,185 were assigned to work in centrally-administered units in the Northwest, most of whom were assigned to heavy industrial departments such as petroleum, coal mines, and electricity; 1,493 were assigned to work in the Greater Administrative Area and five provinces and one city. When carrying out the assignment work, the Northwest Personnel Bureau tried its best to meet the needs of key projects in various provinces and cities.
    These graduates were able to unconditionally obey the needs of the country in the assignment work. After the graduates from other regions who participated in the construction of the Northwest arrived at the Xi'an reception station, most of them wrote "obey the organization's assignment" when filling out their application forms. Zhao Fuchen and Ding Youguang (female), graduates of Shandong Agricultural College, said: Wherever it is the most difficult and wherever it is most needed, assign us there.
    In order to ensure that the graduates arrive at their work locations smoothly, reception stations have been set up in Xi'an, Baoji, and Lanzhou. The Xi'an reception station introduced the situation in the Northwest to the graduates from other regions, and assisted in solving problems such as food, accommodation, and transportation.

    二千六百多高等学校毕业生
    参加祖国西北地区的建设工作
    在西北地区的各项建设岗位上，将有两千六百七十八名全国各地高等学校今年的暑期毕业生参加工作，目前这些毕业生大都已到达各省、市工作地点，即将开始为祖国建设事业贡献出自己的力量。
    今年暑期西北各高等学校毕业学生共一千八百五十二人，其中六百二十八人被分配到中央各部门和其他大行政区工作，留在本区参加工作的有一千二百二十四人。为适应国家建设的需要，从全国各地高等学校调到西北工作的毕业生达一千四百五十四人。这批建设人材有一千一百八十五人被分配到在西北的中央直属单位工作，其中多数人被分配到石油、煤矿、电业等重工业部门；有一千四百九十三人被分配到大区和五省一市工作。西北人事局在进行分配工作时，尽可能满足在各省市重点工程的需要。
    这些毕业生在分配工作中都能无条件地服从国家的需要。外区参加西北建设的毕业生到达西安接待站后，填志愿表时大都写上“服从组织分配”的字样。山东农学院毕业生赵福臣和丁友光（女）表示：哪里最艰苦，哪里最需要，就把我们分配到那里去。
    为了使毕业生顺利到达工作地点，西安、宝鸡、兰州三地都设立了接待站。西安接待站分别给外区来的毕业生介绍西北情况，并协助解决食、宿和交通等问题。
