(Xinhua News Agency, August 24th) When the joint declaration of various democratic parties and people's organizations for the liberation of Taiwan reached the front lines of coastal defense in Fujian and Guangdong provinces, many commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army coastal defense troops, who were vigilantly monitoring the enemy on the front lines, immediately cheered up. They expressed their determination to strive for victory in every battle until Taiwan is liberated and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is completely eliminated.

Xu Sixiao, a combat model and political instructor of an artillery company in a certain unit guarding the coastal defense front in Fujian Province, said: "Although I have gone through countless large and small battles in the past Liberation War and drove the Chiang Kai-shek traitor out of the mainland, I feel that the People's Liberation War has not yet ended and my task has not been completed because Taiwan is still occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and Taiwanese compatriots are still suffering. I must continue to work hard to improve my ability to kill the enemy, fight bravely and fearlessly in the glorious task of liberating Taiwan, and strive for greater glory." Combat hero Song Amu from a certain unit was originally a farmer from Hsinchu, Taiwan. In the past, under the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, his whole family suffered unspeakable hardships. His elder brother was forcibly conscripted twice by Chiang Kai-shek. The first time he was taken away, his family sold all their land to redeem him, but he was soon conscripted again. Life in the family became more and more difficult, and both of his younger sisters were sold to other people. After reading the joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan, Song Amu said excitedly: "The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandits have ruined my family. I want to tell the people of the motherland that I must study modern combat skills with a hundredfold effort, resolutely participate in the battle to liberate Taiwan, and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique!"

Wang Yushan, a combat hero from a certain unit stationed in Hainan Island, said: "Taiwan is the territory of the motherland and must not be allowed to be occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and must not be allowed to be occupied by the American aggressive bloc. We must vigilantly guard Hainan Island and actively prepare to fight as bravely as we did when liberating Hainan Island to liberate Taiwan!" Qian Anliang, a combat hero who has been awarded eight major merits, said: "I must lead my troops well, strengthen political and military training, master the weapons in my hands and the coordinated operations of various arms of the services, and be ready to participate in the battle to liberate Taiwan at any time!" Li Guoren, a labor model from a certain engineering unit, said: "Liberating Taiwan is the glorious task of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We have the determination and confidence to complete this task! Our company has completed a certain engineering task one and a half months ahead of schedule. In the future, we must fight with the revolutionary heroism, and strive to consolidate national defense and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique."

    福建广东海防部队要争取每个战斗的胜利
    【新华社二十四日讯】当各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言传到福建、广东两省海防前线时，许多正在阵地上警惕地监视敌人的人民解放军海防部队的指挥员、战斗员立即振奋起来，他们纷纷表示要争取每一个战斗的胜利，直到解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团。
    守卫在福建省海防前线的某部战斗模范、炮兵连政治指导员徐思晓说：“虽然我在过去解放战争中经过无数次大小战斗把蒋介石卖国贼赶出了大陆，但想到台湾还被蒋介石卖国集团所盘踞，台湾同胞还在遭受苦难，就感到人民解放战争还没有结束，而我的任务还没有完成。我一定要继续努力提高杀敌本领，在完成解放台湾的光荣任务中英勇作战，不怕牺牲，争取更大的光荣。”某部战斗英雄宋阿木原是台湾新竹的农民。过去在蒋介石卖国集团的血腥统治下，他全家遭受了说不尽的苦难。他的哥哥曾被蒋介石抓去过两次强迫当兵，第一次被抓去后，家里卖光田地，才把他赎了回来，但不久又被抓去当兵。家里生活越来越困难，两个妹妹都卖给了人家。宋阿木看到为解放台湾联合宣言后，激动地说：“蒋介石卖国贼害得我家破人散，我要向祖国人民表示：一定要以百倍的努力学习现代作战的本领，坚决参加解放台湾的战斗，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团！”
    驻守海南岛的某部战斗英雄王玉山说：“台湾是祖国的领土，决不能让蒋介石卖国集团盘踞，决不能让美国侵略集团霸占。我们一定警惕地守卫海南岛，并积极准备，像当年解放海南岛一样的英勇作战解放台湾！”曾立过八次大功的战斗英雄钱安良说：“我一定带好部队，加强政治、军事训练，熟练手中武器和诸兵种协同作战，随时准备参加解放台湾的战斗！”工程部队某部劳动模范李国仁说：“解放台湾是中国人民解放军的光荣任务。我们有决心和信心完成这一任务！我们连队已提前一个半月完成某项工程任务，今后，更要以革命英雄主义的战斗精神，为巩固国防，为彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团而奋斗。”
