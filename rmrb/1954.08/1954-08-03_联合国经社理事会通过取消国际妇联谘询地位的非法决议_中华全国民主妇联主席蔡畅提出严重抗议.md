　　Xinhua News Agency, 27th. The United Nations Economic and Social Council, ignoring the opposition of representatives from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, India and other countries in early April, adopted an illegal resolution based on a proposal by the US representative to revoke the "Category B" consultative status enjoyed by the International Democratic Women's Federation at the UN Economic and Social Council. Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, sent a letter to the International Women's Federation to protest this.

　　The letter stated: "We, the women of all of China, lodge a serious protest against this illegal and unreasonable resolution made by the United Nations Economic and Social Council; we express our warm support and active support for all the struggles you are waging to oppose this resolution and strive to restore your status in the United Nations."

　　The letter pointed out: The movements initiated and the work undertaken by the International Democratic Women's Federation are not only for safeguarding the vital interests of women and children, but also in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, it has been enthusiastically supported by peace-loving women all over the world and has become a glorious banner for women all over the world to defend peace and defend their own rights. Precisely because the International Democratic Women's Federation's consistent honest actions and just propositions in the struggle to defend peace and defend the rights of women and children are in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, and are incompatible with the United States' attempt to promote its aggressive policies under the guise of the United Nations, the United States will spare no effort to exclude the International Democratic Women's Federation from its legitimate status and rights in the United Nations. This behavior clearly violates the spirit of the United Nations Charter and is unanimously opposed by all honest, fair-minded, and peace-loving people in the world.

　　The letter concluded: "We believe that in the unremitting struggle to defend peace and defend the rights of women and children, the International Democratic Women's Federation will inevitably unite a wider range of women and will further expand its lofty prestige and influence among the women of the world."

    联合国经社理事会通过取消国际妇联谘询地位的非法决议
    中华全国民主妇联主席蔡畅提出严重抗议
      【新华社二十七日讯】联合国经社理事会在四月初不顾苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、印度等国代表的反对，根据美国代表的提议，通过取消国际民主妇联在联合国经社理事会所享有的“乙”级谘询地位的非法决议，中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅为此致函国际妇联，表示抗议。
    信中说：“我们全中国妇女对联合国经社理事会作出这种非法的无理的决议，提出严重的抗议；对于你们为反对这个决议，争取恢复在联合国中的地位所进行的一切斗争，表示热烈的拥护和积极的支持。”
    信中指出：国际民主妇联所发起的运动和从事的工作不仅是为了保障妇女儿童的切身利益，同时也是符合联合国宪章的精神的，因此它得到了全世界爱好和平的妇女的热烈拥护并成为全世界妇女保卫和平和保卫她们自身权利的光辉的旗帜。正因为国际民主妇联在保卫和平，保卫妇女儿童权利的斗争中的一贯的正直行动和正义主张是和联合国宪章的精神相一致的，而和美国企图假借联合国名义来推行其侵略政策的行为是毫不相容的，所以美国才不惜千方百计地来排挤国际民主妇联在联合国中的合法地位和权益，它这种行为显然违反联合国宪章的精神，也是全世界一切正直、公道、爱好和平的人士所一致反对的。
    信中最后说：“我们相信，国际民主妇联在为保卫和平，保卫妇女儿童权利的不懈的斗争中，将必然会团结更广泛的妇女，并将更加扩大它在全世界妇女群众中的崇高威信和影响。”
