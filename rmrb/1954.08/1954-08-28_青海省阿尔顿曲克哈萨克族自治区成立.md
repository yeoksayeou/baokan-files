Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 27th -- From July 15th to July 25th, the Alton Quoke Kazak populated area of the Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazak Autonomous Region in Qinghai Province held the first session of its first People's Representative Congress in a yurt on the Kuerban Yaji Grassland, formally establishing the Alton Quoke Kazak Autonomous Region. A total of forty-three representatives attended the meeting. Fang Xin, Deputy Secretary of the Haixi Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Chairman of the Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazak Autonomous Region People's Government, and Long Zhou (Mongol), Deputy Secretary-General of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, attended the meeting to offer congratulations. The Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Qinghai Provincial People's Government also sent congratulatory letters and presented silk banners.

The meeting elected Ahamaiti as Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, Awukan, Hu'ermaiti, and three others as Vice Chairmen, and twenty-five government members. It also discussed the future work tasks of the autonomous region. It was decided that in the future, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the higher-level People's Government, the autonomous region would actively exert the effectiveness of the ethnic regional autonomous government, further strengthen unity within the ethnic group and among all ethnic groups, continue to promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, and develop animal husbandry production.

The Alton Quoke Kazak Autonomous Region is a ethnic autonomous region under the Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazak Autonomous Region, equivalent to the district level. The entire region has 207 households, totaling 932 people. The Kazak people of Alton Quoke originally resided in Xinjiang Province. Before liberation, due to unbearable oppression under the reactionary rule of Sheng Shicai, they were scattered along the borders of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces, living in extreme poverty for a long time. In 1953, after the People's Government convened the Friendship Meeting of Kazak Headmen and the Unity Meeting of All Ethnic Groups in the border areas of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang in Lanzhou, the Mongol and Tibetan people of Haixi voluntarily gave up fertile grasslands for them to settle down and engage in production, and helped them establish their homes. Since then, the Kazak people have settled down on the Alton Quoke Grassland. In the past two years, with the strong support of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government and under the leadership of the Alton Quoke Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Kazak people have established new homes, and various livestock have increased significantly. For example, based on the number of livestock in September of last year, camels increased by 20 percent, cattle increased by 48 percent, and sheep increased by 40 percent.

    青海省阿尔顿曲克哈萨克族自治区成立
    【新华社西宁二十七日电】七月十五日到七月二十五日，青海省海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治区阿尔顿曲克哈萨克族聚居地区，在库尔班崖吉草原上一个帐房里，举行了第一届人民代表大会第一次会议，正式成立阿尔顿曲克哈萨克族自治区。出席会议的代表共四十三人。中共海西地方委员会副书记、海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治区人民政府副主席方新，青海省人民政府民族事务委员会副秘书长龙舟（蒙）都到会祝贺。中共中央西北局、中共青海省委员会和青海省人民政府也写信祝贺并赠送锦旗。
    会议选举出阿哈买提为自治区人民政府主席，阿武堪、胡尔买提等五人为副主席，及二十五名政府委员，并讨论了自治区的今后工作任务。确定自治区今后在共产党和上级人民政府领导下，将积极发挥民族区域自治政权的效能，进一步加强民族内部和各民族之间的团结，继续发扬团结互助的精神，发展畜牧业生产。
    阿尔顿曲克哈萨克族自治区是海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治区所属相当于区一级的民族自治区。全区共有二百零七户，九百三十二人。阿尔顿曲克的哈萨克族人民，原居住在新疆省。解放前因不堪盛世才反动统治的压迫，流散在甘肃、青海和新疆三省边境，长期过着极端贫困的生活。一九五三年人民政府在兰州召开了甘、青、新三省边境哈族头人联谊会和各民族团结会后，海西蒙、藏人民自动让出肥美的草原给他们安家生产，并帮助他们建立家务。从此，哈萨克族人民就在阿尔顿曲克草原上安居下来。近两年来，在青海省人民政府大力扶助下和中共阿尔顿曲克工作委员会的领导下，哈萨克族人民建立了新的家园，各种牲畜有显著增加。如以去年九月的牲畜作基数，骆驼增加了百分之二十，牛增加了百分之四十八，绵羊增加了百分之四十。
