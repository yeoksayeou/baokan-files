Thanks from French POWs
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhang Jie

In Viet Tri, northwest of Hanoi, the exchange of prisoners of war between the Vietnam People's Army and the French Union forces has been going on for several days. Whenever it is POW exchange day, people can see a moving scene: the heartfelt gratitude of French prisoners of war to the Vietnam People's Army.

The transfer point for French POWs is in a beautiful grove on the banks of the Lo River. On exchange days, French boats sail up the Red River into the Lo River to transport the transferred prisoners back to Hanoi. Not far from this transfer point is the place where the French side transfers Vietnamese People's Army prisoners of war. People can vaguely hear the Vietnamese People's Army prisoners of war there shouting "Long live President Ho Chi Minh" with impassioned voices. But here at the French POW exchange point, the atmosphere is filled with joy.

Under the green shade, prisoners of war of various skin colors, wearing peace dove badges on their chests, are saying goodbye to the staff of the Vietnam People's Army, reluctant to part. Some hold the hands of the Vietnamese staff tightly, while others borrow the accordions of the Vietnamese cultural troupe members and sing Vietnamese songs they have learned together. Their healthy and cheerful mood even amazes the foreign journalists present.

Many prisoners of war hand letters to the Vietnamese staff before leaving. A French prisoner of war said in his letter: "I will never forget that the Vietnamese people wore ragged clothes during the war of resistance, while I could receive two new clothes every year; I will never forget that we received more medical supplies than the Vietnamese people, and I will never forget that the Vietnamese people let us eat rice in the days of food shortage. Even in the most difficult seasons, we can get the same rations as the People's Army soldiers who are guarding us."

A prisoner of war named Mohammed Ben Abdeslem sat with the Vietnamese staff with a smile. A moving story about him has been circulating among the prisoners of war. Not long ago, to bless the prisoners of war to return home and live a peaceful life, the people of Viet Tri held a comfort meeting and gave bananas, cigarettes, and other gifts to the prisoners of war. The comfort meeting was going smoothly, but Abdeslem couldn't control himself, and he excitedly ran to the stage to speak. He said: "In the French army, I have stayed in Bac Ninh, Thai Binh, and other areas. What kind of things did we do! It was burning, killing, looting, and hurting innocent people. Because of these things, I was very afraid of the 'Viet Minh' army. Even after the French army I was in was defeated, I hid in the bushes and trees and didn't dare to come out for a long time. But after being captured, when I saw the Vietnam People's Army soldiers giving us their rations to eat, and saw the Vietnamese people in distress caring for us so much, I cried many times in the middle of the night!" Now, this Abdeslem, who was originally a Moroccan farmer, is again telling the Vietnamese staff that he no longer needs war, all he needs is to go home and live a peaceful life.

Another German prisoner of war was recounting his feelings about being repatriated in Viet Tri. During the war, he had lived in Viet Tri for three weeks. He personally saw the French troops bomb the villages around Viet Tri with artillery, killing residents and plowing oxen; he also personally saw the French army bulldozing houses to create "no man's land." He said that when he learned that he would be repatriated in Viet Tri and saw the local people's tolerance and care for the prisoners of war in Viet Tri, this coincidence moved him greatly.

The French boat approached. At this time, the prisoners of war, who were chatting with the Vietnamese staff, seemed even more excited. Those who were busy packing their luggage also rushed up to shake hands with the Vietnamese staff to thank them. Their luggage contained the clothes, mosquito nets, teacups, and other supplies they had received. After the prisoners of war entered the cabin, they stretched out their heads and waved goodbye to their Vietnamese friends. The boat was far from the shore, but the sound of the prisoners of war shouting "Long live Chairman Ho" and singing songs still came from the center of the river.

In contrast to the situation of the French prisoners of war, the Vietnamese People's Army prisoners of war who returned home were mostly sallow and emaciated. Some of them even lay on the ground from hunger as soon as they landed. One prisoner of war told reporters that they were locked in the cabin the night before the repatriation, with nothing to eat or drink. They generally expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of the French side.

### 法军战俘的感谢

    法军战俘的感谢
    新华社记者　张结
    在河内西北的越池，越南人民军方面和法联邦军方面的战俘交换工作已经进行了好几天了。每当战俘交换的日子，人们可以看到一个动人的景象，那就是法军被俘人员对越南人民军的衷心的感谢。
    法军被俘人员的移交地点在泸江江边的一个风景幽美的树林里面。每逢交接的日子，法军方面的汽艇便溯红河进入泸江，将移交的战俘运回河内。离这交接地点不远，是法军方面移交越南人民军被俘人员的地方，人们可以隐约地听到那里越南人民军被俘人员激昂地高呼“胡志明主席万岁”的声音。但在法军战俘交接地点这里，却被欢快的气氛所笼罩着。
    在绿荫下面，胸前别着和平鸽徽章的各种肤色的战俘在和越南人民军的工作人员依依话别，他们有的紧紧拉着越南工作人员的手，有的借来越南文工队员们的手风琴，围在一起唱着他们所学会的越南歌曲。他们健康和欢快的情绪甚至使在这里的各国记者感到惊异。
    许多战俘在离别前把一封封的信交给越南工作人员。一个法籍战俘在信中说：“我永远忘不了越南人民在抗战中只穿着破烂的衣服，而我却每年可以领到两件新衣；我永远忘不了我们所领到的比越南人民更多的医药用品，也永远忘不了越南人民在青黄不接的日子里让我们吃到大米。即使在最困难的季节，我们也可以得到完全和看管我们的人民军战士相同的口粮。”
    一个名叫穆罕默德·本·阿布戴斯莱姆的战俘微笑着和越南的工作人员坐在一起，关于他，在战俘中间曾经流传着一个动人的故事。那是在不久以前，为了祝福战俘们能够回家过和平生活，越池人民曾经举行了一个慰问会，并且把香蕉、纸烟和其他的礼品送给战俘们。慰问会顺利地进行着，但阿布戴斯莱姆却控制不住自己，他激动地跑到台上讲话。他说：“在法国部队里面，我曾经在北宁、太平和别的地区呆过，我们所做的是什么样的事情啊！是烧、杀、抢劫和伤害无辜的老百姓。为了这些，我心里对‘越盟’军队很害怕，甚至在我所在的法国部队被击溃了，我还躲在草丛和树林里面，好久不敢出来。但在被俘以后，当我看到越南人民军战士拿着自己的口粮给我们吃，看到在困苦中的越南老百姓却那么关怀我们，有好多次我在深夜里哭了！”现在，还是这个原是摩洛哥农民的阿布戴斯莱姆又在向越南工作人员表示，他再也不需要战争，他所需要的只是回家过和平生活。
    另一个德籍战俘在述说他对在越池被遣返的感想。在战争期间，他曾经有三个星期住在越池，他亲眼看到法国部队用炮火轰击越池周围的村庄，打死居民和耕牛；他也亲眼看见法军用推土机把一幢幢房子辗平，以制造“无人区”。他说，当他得知他将在越池被遣返，并且在越池看到当地人民对战俘的宽待和关怀时，这个巧合使他极为感动。
    法军方面的汽艇驶近了。这时，和越南工作人员娓娓话别的战俘们显得更加激动了。忙着整理行装的也纷纷扑上来和越南工作人员握手致谢。他们的行囊里有着他们所领到的衣服、蚊帐、茶缸以及其他用品。战俘进入船舱后还伸出头来，向越南的友人挥手告别。汽艇离岸已经好远，但从江心还传来战俘高呼“胡主席万岁”的声音和歌声。
    和法军战俘的情形相反，遣返归来的越南人民军被俘人员大都面黄肌瘦、羸弱不堪，其中有的人甚至在刚一登岸便饿得躺在地上了。一个战俘告诉记者说，在遣返的前一天晚上，他们便被关在船舱里，没有一点东西吃，也没有水喝。他们普遍对法军方面的态度表示不满。
