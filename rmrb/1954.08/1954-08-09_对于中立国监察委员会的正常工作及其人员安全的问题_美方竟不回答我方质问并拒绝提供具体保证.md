Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. At the Military Armistice Commission meeting held on the 6th, the U.S. Senior Member, Mr. Britton, refused to guarantee the punishment of the masterminds and murderers in incidents that threatened the safety and work of the Neutral Nations personnel, and refused to guarantee that the U.S. side would take effective measures to ensure the normal work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the safety of its personnel. Britton also avoided giving responsible answers to a series of questions raised by General Li Sang Cho. This attitude of the U.S. side fully exposed the U.S. intention to undermine the provisions of the Armistice Agreement regarding the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

At the meeting on the 6th, General Li Sang Cho first suggested that the Military Armistice Commission immediately make a responsible reply to the letter from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission dated August 4th and provide specific guarantees. In its letter, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission expressed “deep concern” about the incidents endangering the safety of Neutral Nations personnel occurring in the U.S. area, and requested that "United Nations Command take full and effective measures to ensure the safety of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel, and the normal working conditions of the Neutral Nations inspection teams, and hopes that the United Nations Command will punish the guilty personnel."

Under the questioning of General Li Sang Cho, Britton had to admit that the U.S. side had the responsibility to guarantee and assist the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and expressed its willingness to fulfill this responsibility, but he rashly rejected Li Sang Cho's suggestion.

Li Sang Cho pointed out that the U.S. refusal to provide clear guarantees only further exposes the truth of the U.S. side's serious violation of the Armistice Agreement. General Li Sang Cho emphasized that the U.S. side has an inescapable obligation to provide clear guarantees. He then questioned Britton: "Does your side acknowledge that it should abide by the provisions of Paragraph 13 (c) and (d) of the Armistice Agreement?" "Is your side willing to provide this guarantee now?" According to the provisions of these two paragraphs of the Armistice Agreement, the U.S. side must take full and effective measures to ensure that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations inspection teams are given full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation in the performance of their designated tasks and duties; and to ensure the freedom and convenience necessary for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel to properly perform their duties.

Britton vaguely avoided giving a direct answer, saying, "There is no need to make further guarantees."

Li Sang Cho pointed out that the U.S. refusal to provide guarantees violates the provisions of Paragraph 13 (c) and Paragraph 17 of the Armistice Agreement.

Li Sang Cho then asked Britton again: "Does your side acknowledge that it should abide by the provisions of Paragraph 13 (b) of the Armistice Agreement?" "Is your side willing to provide some guarantees now?" According to this paragraph, the U.S. side must severely punish all criminals who endanger the Neutral Nations personnel and threaten the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in the performance of its duties and tasks.

Britton acknowledged that the responsibilities assigned to the U.S. side by the Armistice Agreement were "clear and unambiguous," but he still refused to provide guarantees.

Li Sang Cho pointed out that the U.S. refusal to punish criminals in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement violates the provisions of Paragraph 13 (b) of the Armistice Agreement. He then asked Britton again: "Does your side guarantee that there will be no further incidents in your area that endanger the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and threaten the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in the performance of its duties and tasks?"
"Does your side guarantee that it will take all necessary measures and methods in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement to ensure the thorough implementation of all clauses in the Armistice Agreement relating to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission?"

Britton merely stated that General Li Sang Cho's statement "has been noted," but still avoided answering the above questions. Under Li Sang Cho's continuous questioning, Britton could neither provide guarantees nor make any specific answers, and finally hurriedly suggested an adjournment.

Li Sang Cho finally pointed out that the U.S. refusal to provide responsible and clear guarantees fully demonstrates that the U.S. side intends to continue such threats and acts of violence, thereby undermining the clauses of the Armistice Agreement relating to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, recklessly and illegally importing massive military reinforcements, deepening the instability of the Korean Armistice, and creating tension in Asia. Before the end of the meeting, Li Sang Cho warned the U.S. side twice: "Your side must bear all the responsibility for any actions of your side that violate the Armistice Agreement and the possible consequences arising therefrom."

    对于中立国监察委员会的正常工作及其人员安全的问题
    美方竟不回答我方质问并拒绝提供具体保证
      【新华社开城七日电】在六日举行的军事停战委员会会议上，美方首席委员布里敦拒绝保证惩办威胁中立国人员安全和工作的事件中的主谋和凶手，拒绝保证美方采取有效措施来保证中立国监察委员会的正常工作及其人员的安全。布里敦还对李相朝将军提出的一系列问题避不作负责的答复。美方的这种态度充分暴露了美方企图破坏停战协定中关于中立国监察委员会的条款的用心。
    李相朝将军在六日会议上首先建议由军事停战委员会立即对中立国监察委员会八月四日的来信作负责的答复，并提供具体保证。中立国监察委员会在它的信中对美方地区发生的危及中立国人员安全的事件“深表关怀”，并要求“联合国军采取充分有效措施，保证中立国监察委员会人员的安全，以及中立国视察小组的正常工作条件，并希望联合国军惩罚有罪人员。”
    在李相朝将军的质问下，布里敦不得不承认美方对于中立国监察委员会有保证和协助的责任，并表示愿意履行这个责任，但是，他却轻率地拒绝了李相朝的建议。
    李相朝指出：美方拒绝提出明确保证，只是更加暴露美方严重违反停战协定的真相。李相朝将军强调美方有不可逃避的义务提供明确保证。他接着质问布里敦：“你方是否承认应该遵守停战协定第十三款午项和酉项的规定？”“你方现在是否愿作此保证？”按照停战协定中这两项的规定，美方必须采取充分有效的措施，保证中立国监察委员会及中立国视察小组在执行其指定的任务和职司时，给予充分保护及一切可能的协助和合作；保证中立国监察委员会人员为适当执行其职司所必需的自由和便利。
    布里敦含糊其词地不作正面的回答，他说，“没有必要作进一步的保证。”
    李相朝指出：美方拒绝提供保证违反了停战协定第十三款午项和第十七款的规定。
    李相朝接着再问布里敦：“你方是否承认应该遵守停战协定第十三款辰项的规定？”“你方现在是否愿作些保证？”按照这一项的规定，美方必须对危害中立国人员及威胁中立国监察委员会执行其职司和任务的所有罪犯予以严惩。
    布里敦承认停战协定赋予美方的责任是“清楚和明确的”，但他还是不肯提供保证。
    李相朝指出：美方拒绝按照停战协定的规定惩办罪犯，这是违反停战协定第十三款辰项的规定的。他接着再问布里敦：“你方是否保证在你方地区内不再发生任何危害中立国监察委员会人员及威胁中立国监察委员会执行其职司和任务的情况？”
  “你方是否保证按照停战协定的规定，采取一切必要的措施和办法，使停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的全部条款得以彻底执行？”
    布里敦只是声称李相朝将军的发言“已注意到了”，但仍然避不回答上面的问题。布里敦在李相朝的连续追问之下，既不能提供保证，又不能作出任何具体的回答，最后只有匆忙地建议休会。
    李相朝最后指出：美方拒绝提供负责的和明确的保证，充分说明美方企图继续这种威胁和暴力行为，借此破坏停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的款条，放手地大量非法运进军事增援，加深朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，制造亚洲的紧张局势。李相朝在会议结束前两次警告美方：“对于任何你方违反停战协定的行为及其可能产生的后果，你方必须负担全部的责任。”
