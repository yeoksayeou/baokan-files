Students from various schools in Chongqing are happily spending their summer vacation. Many university and college summer clubs and sports fields are frequently filled with joyful crowds. In agricultural production cooperatives and in the suburban fields, student groups for visits and outings constantly appear. At the famous scenic spots of Beibei and Nanwenquan, groups of students often go boating, swimming, and having get-togethers. In late July, many tents were pitched in Huaxi near Nanwenquan, where some students from Chongqing University, Southwest Normal College, Chongqing No. 1 Middle School and other schools successively began military camping life. Several hundred students also signed up at the Chongqing Datianwan Square parachute tower to learn parachuting. The Chongqing Municipal Labor People's Cultural Palace also saw groups of students. Many children wearing red scarves held team days there; in the "Children's Paradise," the crisp laughter often attracted tourists from all directions. Students from universities and middle schools went to the Cultural Palace to play ball games or swim.

During the summer vacation, students also widely read literary works and watched movies. Under the leadership of the Communist Youth League, they discussed their impressions after reading literary works and watching films. Some students who are interested in science and art have also drawn up summer activity plans. Zhang Zhengcai, a student at Chongqing No. 20 Middle School, won an award in this year's city-wide "June 1st" International Children's Day creation exhibition for manufacturing a radio amplifier. He plans to install another radio for the school during the summer vacation.

Some students are preparing to participate in the "Preparation for Labor and Defense" sports system training course held by the Chongqing Municipal People's Government Sports Commission.
