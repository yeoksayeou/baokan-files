At exactly 10:00 AM, the leaders of the Korean party, government, and military, headed by Marshal Kim Il Sung, ascended the reviewing stand, and the people on the square cheered enthusiastically.

Vice Marshal Choi Yong-kun, Minister of National Defense of Korea, inspected the troops of various branches of the People's Army by car and extended holiday greetings to them. He then delivered a speech, calling on all officers and soldiers of the People's Army to fight to defend the economic construction of the motherland and strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

At 10:30 AM, the grand military parade began.

Leading the way was a team of officers from the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, followed by military school cadets and students from various arms of service. The infantry and artillery units of the People's Army passed under the reviewing stand in a neat and imposing formation. As motorized units, mechanized units, and tank units successively entered the square, teams of jet bombers and jet fighters, in neat formations, swept over the square at lightning speed. The Korean people responded with enthusiastic cheers for their soldiers.

After the military parade, 300,000 people began the march. The marching crowds held up huge banners with slogans such as "Strive to turn the Korean Armistice into a solid peace" and "The Korean issue must be resolved by the Korean people themselves," demonstrating the Korean people's confidence and determination to fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Columns of workers, farmers, government employees, students, literary and art workers, and more than 1,000 athletes participating in the Korean National Games marched past the reviewing stand.

At night, ten thousand lights painted the magnificent posture of Pyongyang, a city rising from the ruins. The red five-pointed star on the "Liberation Tower" on Moranbong Hill and the multiple strings of electric lights running through the tower emitted brilliant light. Countless colorful fireworks rushed into the night sky, leaving trails of light. The wide and straight Stalin Street was brightly lit. The newly built Mao Zedong Square looked particularly beautiful under the lights. The streets were filled with traffic and people. People sang and danced to their hearts' content, reveling until late at night.

[Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th] Marshal Kim Il Sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, held a grand banquet on the evening of the 15th to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the "August 15th" Korean Liberation.

The banquet was attended by: leaders of the Korean Workers' Party, leaders of the Supreme People's Assembly, Vice Premiers of the Cabinet, Ministers of the Cabinet and leading cadres of various provinces, heads of various democratic parties and mass organizations, senior generals of the Korean People's Army and heroes of the Republic, labor heroes, and representatives of workers, farmers, youth, women, and people from all walks of life, totaling more than 300 people.

Invited to the banquet were diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials of the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries stationed in Korea, as well as foreign guests.

The delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers invited to participate in the "August 15th" celebration also attended the banquet.

At the beginning of the banquet, Marshal Kim Il Sung delivered a speech. He first extended congratulations to all attendees in the name of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, expressed sincere thanks to the great Soviet Union, the liberator of the Korean people, and expressed sincere thanks to the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries who had given great support to the Korean people in the anti-aggression war in Korea and in the post-war reconstruction.

Marshal Kim Il Sung said: The armistice is only the first step towards achieving lasting peace. Therefore, it has become the greatest task of our people to further consolidate the positive results achieved as a result of the signing of the armistice agreement, to rapidly rebuild the people's economy destroyed by the war and to develop it with all our strength, to build the material foundation for a peacefully unified Korea, and to strengthen the democratic base of the Republic. Only by successfully completing these tasks can we achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland and consolidate peace, and contribute to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

Marshal Kim Il Sung pointed out that the assistance of fraternal countries, the patriotic enthusiasm of the Korean people, the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, and the correct policies of the Republic's government are sufficient conditions to ensure the effective completion of this task. He then outlined the remarkable achievements made by the Korean people in the year of recovery and reconstruction since the armistice.

Marshal Kim Il Sung then pointed out: In the past year, the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang have continuously violated the armistice agreement, taken a series of provocative actions, and tried their best to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, attempting to solve international problems with a "policy of strength". This behavior of the American reactionary ruling group has increasingly isolated itself.

Marshal Kim Il Sung emphasized that we will continue to resolutely fight to the end for the reunification of the motherland, which is deeply concerned by all Korean people, through peaceful consultations in accordance with democratic principles that conform to the interests of our people.

    【新华社平壤十六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成元帅十五日晚举行盛大宴会，庆祝“八·一五”朝鲜解放九周年。
    出席宴会的有：朝鲜劳动党领导人，最高人民会议领导人，内阁副首相、内阁各相和各省领导干部，各民主政党、群众团体负责人，朝鲜人民军高级将领和共和国英雄、劳动英雄和工人、农民、青年、妇女代表及各界人士共三百多人。

    金日成元帅说：停战只是实现巩固和平的第一步。因此，进一步巩固由于停战协定的签订而达成的肯定结果，迅速重建被战争破坏的人民经济并全力加以发展，建设和平统一朝鲜的物质基础，加强共和国的民主基地，就成了我国人民的最大任务。只有胜利地完成这些任务，我们才可能达成祖国的和平统一和巩固的和平，并对亚洲及世界和平事业有所贡献。

    金日成元帅接着指出：在过去的一年中，美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮不断地违反停战协定，采取了一连串的挑衅行动，竭力阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，企图以“实力政策”来解决国际问题。美国反动统治集团的这种行为，已使自己日益陷于孤立。
    金日成元帅强调说：我们将继续为了按着符合我国人民利益的民主原则，以和平协商方式争取全朝鲜人民所深切关心的祖国统一而坚决斗争到底。
