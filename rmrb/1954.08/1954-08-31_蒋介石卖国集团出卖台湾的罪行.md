    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the protection and support of American bayonets, has been gradually selling out China's sacred territory of Taiwan to its American masters ever since the Japanese surrender in 1945. In recent years, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has even acted as a tool for the United States to subvert the People's Republic of China, turning Taiwan into a base for plotting attacks against our country and aggression against Asia. The people of Taiwan are suffering unprecedented disasters under the dual oppression of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
    From the time of the Japanese surrender, American imperialism launched a series of aggressive activities against Taiwan. The national degenerate Chiang Kai-shek, in order to win the support of his American masters, spared no effort to satisfy the various demands put forward by the United States.
    Around October 25, 1946, MacArthur, then Commander of the U.S. Far East Command, secretly consulted with Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Tzu-wen, and other bandits in Taipei regarding the conditions for Chiang's betrayal of Taiwan. In this meeting, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique recognized the "special status" of the United States in Taiwan. From then on, the United States began to acquire the privilege of controlling Taiwan's major enterprises, ports, and constructing military bases.
    In November 1946, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and the United States signed the so-called "Sino-American Treaty of Commerce and Navigation," selling out China to the United States. According to this treaty, the United States had the privilege of "freely operating" various enterprises and using the seaports of Keelung and Kaohsiung in Taiwan.
    In December 1947, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique signed the "Sino-American Naval Agreement" with the United States, selling the two major seaports of Keelung and Kaohsiung to the United States as naval bases.
    In February 1948, the U.S. and Chiang signed an agreement for the so-called "joint development" of Taiwan. According to this agreement, the United States also obtained the privilege of exploiting mineral resources such as coal, oil, tungsten, antimony, gold, and sulfur. In June of the same year, the "U.S. Aid Technical Investigation Team" headed by the aggressor Stillman arrived in Taiwan and investigated in detail the situation of Taiwan's industrial and mining enterprises, railway transportation, and water conservancy facilities. In August of the same year, U.S. President's Special Envoy Wedemeyer went to Taiwan for "inspection." During this "inspection," Wedemeyer studied and formulated specific plans for the United States to control Taiwan's economy.
    Through this series of traitorous activities, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek had turned Taiwan into an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" (confession of the war-monger MacArthur) that the United States could use to "control every Asian seaport from Vladivostok to Singapore with its air force." At the same time, American monopoly capital gradually controlled all the economic lifelines of Taiwan.
    After the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique was driven out of mainland China in 1949, it fled to Taiwan to make a last-ditch struggle. The United States brazenly armed and occupied Taiwan, sheltering the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and began to provide huge military and economic "aid" to reorganize and expand the remaining forces of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, preparing to "counterattack the mainland" and plot a restoration.
    For several years, the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has become the "focus" of American "aid" to the Far East region. The military "aid" given by the United States to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has reached more than one billion U.S. dollars. According to bandit gang news agency reports, in the four years from July 1950 to June 1954, the economic assistance given by the United States to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique amounted to 396.8 million U.S. dollars.
    While accepting "U.S. aid," the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique placed all its political, military, and economic affairs under the direct control of the United States. American monopoly capital is carrying out a cruel plunder of Taiwan. In March 1951, the "Executive Yuan" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique established a "Financial and Economic Group," with senior U.S. officials stationed in Taiwan serving as "advisers," and all major economic measures were decided by this group. In July 1953, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique expanded the "Financial and Economic Group" into the "Economic Stabilization Committee." Article 9 of the committee's organizational regulations stipulates: "The committee may invite the heads or experts of the U.S. Mutual Security Agency in China and other relevant U.S. agencies in China to attend meetings." Through this method, American plunderers directly controlled the economic power of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Now, the United States has sent a so-called "economic advisory group" headed by Eisenhower's economic aide, Stephen, to Taiwan to plan further measures to strengthen its economic control and plunder of Taiwan.
    This series of traitorous activities by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has enabled American monopoly capital to penetrate Taiwan directly. Since 1947, American companies have set up branches and offices in Taiwan. In June 1952, the U.S. and Chiang signed the so-called "Investment Guarantee Agreement," providing various convenient conditions for Wall Street bosses to invest and exploit in Taiwan. This July, the "Legislative Yuan" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique passed the so-called "Foreign Investment Regulations," enabling American monopoly capital to plunder Taiwan even more freely. According to figures disclosed in Chiang's bandit newspapers alone, from June 1950 to June 1954, direct U.S. investment in Taiwan under the names of "industrial assistance" and "technical assistance" reached more than 91.8 million U.S. dollars.
    American monopoly capital has penetrated every economic sector of Taiwan without leaving a single space, manipulating Taiwan's economic lifeline. Taiwan's major industrial and mining sectors are controlled by American capital. For example, Westinghouse Electric Company of the United States controls Taiwan's power industry; Reynolds Metals Company of the United States controls Taiwan's aluminum metal industry; Taiwan's largest industry, the sugar industry, is also manipulated by American capitalists. Other industries, such as chemical fertilizers, petroleum, and camphor, also have a large amount of American capital.
    In order to adapt to the aggressive war policy of American imperialism in the Far East, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has turned Taiwan's economy to a militarized track. The so-called "industrial construction" carried out by this traitorous clique is, under the manipulation of the U.S. White Engineering Company, to build barracks, railways, highways, airports, bridges, and ports in Taiwan, in an attempt to strengthen Taiwan's military facilities and turn Taiwan into an American naval and air base.
    The so-called "Sino-American Joint Committee on Rural Reconstruction" controlled by the United States is a tool for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to sell out Taiwan's agriculture. Through this institution, American monopoly capital manipulates Taiwan's agricultural production and carries out colonial exploitation of Taiwan's farmers. American capitalists monopolize the production and marketing of chemical fertilizers, which are indispensable for agricultural production in Taiwan, and sell fertilizers to farmers at extremely high prices, carrying out cruel exploitation. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique also colludes with American capital to organize the land it seized into so-called "cooperative farms," using American machinery and the cheap labor of Taiwanese farmers to extract huge profits. In addition, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique forces Taiwanese farmers to change a large amount of paddy fields to grow sugarcane and camphor, which are most beneficial to American capital, making Taiwan's economy a colonialized economy dependent on the United States.
    Taiwan has become a dumping market for American surplus commodities. According to figures disclosed in Chiang's bandit newspapers, from 1950 to June 1954, the United States dumped commodities in Taiwan through "material assistance" alone amounted to more than 290 million U.S. dollars, equivalent to more than 65 percent of Taiwan's foreign exchange settlement amount during this period. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique also follows the orders of the United States to make Taiwan's economy and Japan's economy mutually dependent, forming an American colonial economic system in Asia, in order to serve the United States' aggressive plans and colonial plunder plans in the Far East. According to this plan, Taiwan's agricultural products are mainly exported to Japan, while Japan's light industrial products are imported into Taiwan in large quantities. This measure by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has deepened Taiwan's economic dependence and seriously undermined the development of Taiwan's local industry.
    The crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in selling out Taiwan, turning Taiwan into an American military base and colony, as well as the endless exploitation by American capital and Chiang's bandit bureaucrats, have caused the people of Taiwan to suffer increasing hardship.
    Economic colonization, heavy military burdens, and the extortionate levies of the huge military and bureaucratic apparatus are the direct causes of the increasingly difficult life of the people of Taiwan. Even with the "aid" of its American masters, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's finances are constantly in deficit. The bandit "China News" newspaper admitted: There will be a deficit of nearly 50 million U.S. dollars in the 1954-1955 fiscal year. In order to save the financial crisis, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has repeatedly intensified its search for the people of Taiwan, and exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes have reached the highest record in history. In the past five years, Chiang's bandit gang has continuously increased tax rates and added new tax items. According to Chiang's bandit newspapers, Chiang's bandit's tax revenue in 1949 was more than 53 million yuan in counterfeit currency, which increased to more than 1.98 billion yuan in 1953, an increase of more than 36 times. Since this year, tax revenues have continued to increase. At the same time, due to the dumping of American and Japanese commodities in Taiwan, Taiwan's foreign trade has created a huge import surplus. For example, in October 1953, excluding "U.S. aid" imports, Taiwan's foreign trade import surplus still reached 8.61 million U.S. dollars, exceeding the total value of exports for the entire month. In order to save the lack of foreign exchange caused by the increase in import surplus, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, regardless of the needs of the people's lives, desperately exported many materials that were originally in short supply in Taiwan. In order to increase rice exports, this traitorous clique even forced the people of Taiwan to replace part of the rice with sweet potatoes to satisfy their hunger. In order to make up for the deficit, this traitorous clique also adopted the method of issuing more banknotes. This has caused periodic inflation. Coupled with the depletion of materials caused by desperate exports, the prices of goods in Taiwan, especially the prices of people's daily necessities, continue to rise.
    Under the dual oppression of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the people of Taiwan have fallen into a very miserable situation. The working people have fallen into the abyss of hunger and death due to heavy taxes, high prices, and meager income. Even the report of the "State-owned Enterprise Investigation Group" of the "Executive Yuan" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in March 1951 admitted: "Even workers with high salaries cannot maintain their family life." According to the "Chairman of the Taiwan Anti-Tuberculosis Association" of Chiang's bandit, one person dies of lung disease every 43 minutes in Taiwan.
    In addition to being threatened by hunger, the people of Taiwan are also subjected to the cruel suppression and persecution of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Relying on the protection of American bayonets, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique implemented a terrorist fascist rule in Taiwan. The army, military police, and police of this traitorous clique are constantly carrying out large-scale searches, arrests, and massacres. Patriotic people and innocent people in Taiwan have suffered bloody persecution. The so-called "joint guarantee measures" implemented by this traitorous clique in various factories, schools, and pseudo-government agencies, troops, and groups have made everyone feel insecure, creating an extremely terrifying atmosphere. Under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, Taiwan has become a dark and terrifying world.
    The heinous crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in selling out Taiwan and colluding with the United States to plunder and trample on our Taiwanese compatriots are absolutely intolerable to the 600 million Chinese people and are unanimously opposed by the people of the world. The Chinese people must liberate the people of Taiwan from the enslavement of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and bring them back to the embrace of the motherland to live a free and happy life.

    蒋介石卖国集团出卖台湾的罪行
    成达
    在美国的刺刀的庇护和支持下的蒋介石卖国集团，早从一九四五年日本投降时起，就逐步把中国的神圣领土台湾出卖给它的美国主子。这几年来，蒋介石卖国集团更充当美国颠覆中华人民共和国的工具，把台湾变成为阴谋进攻我国、侵略亚洲的基地。台湾人民在美国和蒋介石卖国集团双重压榨之下，遭受到空前未有的灾难。
    美帝国主义从日本投降后起就对台湾展开了一系列的侵略活动。民族败类蒋介石为了赢得美国主子的支持，不惜尽力满足美国所提出的种种要求。
    一九四六年十月二十五日前后，当时美国远东军总司令麦克阿瑟与蒋介石、宋子文等匪在台北秘密会商蒋匪出卖台湾的条件。蒋介石卖国集团在这次会议中，承认美国在台湾具有“特殊地位”，从此以后，美国开始取得了控制台湾主要企业、港口及建筑军事基地的特权。
    一九四六年十一月，蒋介石卖国集团和美国签订了把中国出卖给美国的所谓“中美通商航海条约”。根据这个条约，美国在台湾有“自由经营”各种企业、使用基隆、高雄海港等特权。
    一九四七年十二月，蒋介石卖国集团又和美国签订“中美海军协定”，把基隆、高雄两大海港出卖给美国做海军基地。
    一九四八年二月，美蒋签订了所谓“共同开发”台湾的协定。根据这个协定，美国又取得了开采煤、石油、钨、锑、黄金、硫磺等矿产资源的特权。同年六月，以侵略分子史蒂尔曼为首的“美援技术调查团”到达台湾，详细调查了台湾的工矿企业、铁路交通和水利设备的情况。同年八月，美国总统特使魏德迈前往台湾“视察”，在这次“视察”中，魏德迈研究并拟订了美国控制台湾经济的具体方案。
    通过这一系列的卖国活动，蒋介石卖国贼已把台湾变为美国所谓“用空军控制自海参崴到新加坡的每一亚洲的海港”的“不沉的航空母舰”（战争贩子麦克阿瑟的招供）。同时美国垄断资本逐步控制了台湾的一切经济命脉。
    一九四九年蒋介石卖国集团被赶出中国大陆以后，逃往台湾作最后挣扎。美国悍然武装侵占台湾，庇护蒋介石卖国集团，并开始给予庞大的军事和经济“援助”，整编和扩充蒋介石卖国集团的残余力量，准备“反攻大陆”，阴谋复辟。
    数年来，台湾蒋介石卖国集团成了美国对远东区域进行“援助”的“重点”。美国给予蒋介石卖国集团的军事“援助”已达十亿美元以上。据匪帮通讯社透露，从一九五零年七月到一九五四年六月的四年内，美国给予蒋介石卖国集团的经济援助达三亿九千六百八十万美元。
    蒋介石卖国集团在接受“美援”的同时，把全部政治、军事和经济置于美国直接控制之下。美国垄断资本对台湾进行着残酷的掠夺。一九五一年三月，蒋介石卖国集团“行政院”成立“财政经济小组”，由美国驻台高级官员充当“顾问”，而一切重大的经济措施均由该小组决定。一九五三年七月，蒋介石卖国集团将“财政经济小组”扩大为“经济安定委员会”，该委员会的组织规程第九条规定：“委员会得邀请美国驻华共同安全分署及美国驻华其他有关机关首长或专家列席会议”。通过这种办法，美国掠夺者直接掌握着台湾蒋介石卖国集团的经济大权。现在，美国又派遣了一个以艾森豪威尔的经济助手斯特芬为首的所谓“经济顾问团”到台湾去，策划进一步加强对台湾的经济控制与掠夺的措施。
    蒋介石卖国集团这一连串的卖国活动，使美国垄断资本得以长驱直入地侵入台湾。自一九四七年起，美国公司纷纷在台湾设立分公司和办事处。一九五二年六月，美蒋签订所谓“投资保证协定”，给华尔街老板在台湾的投资和榨取以种种便利条件。今年七月，蒋介石卖国集团“立法院”又通过所谓“外国人投资条例”，使美国垄断资本能够更加放手地对台湾进行掠夺。仅据蒋匪报纸透露的数字，从一九五零年六月到一九五四年六月的四年中，美国在“工业援助”和“技术援助”的名义下对台湾的直接投资，即已达九千一百八十余万美元。
    美国垄断资本无孔不入地侵入台湾的各个经济部门，操纵了台湾的经济命脉。台湾的主要工矿企业部门，都被美国资本所控制。例如美国的威斯汀豪斯电气公司控制了台湾的电力工业；美国雷诺金属公司控制了台湾的铝金属工业；台湾最大的工业——制糖业，也操纵在美国资本家的手里，其他如化学肥料、石油、樟脑等工业中也都有大量美国资本。
    为了适应美帝国主义在远东的侵略战争政策，蒋介石卖国集团将台湾的经济转向军事化的轨道。这个卖国集团进行的所谓“工业建设”，就是在美国怀特工程公司的操纵下，在台湾修建兵营、铁路、公路、飞机场、桥梁、港口等，企图加强台湾的军事设施，把台湾变成美国的海空军基地。
    由美国所控制的所谓“中美农村复兴联合委员会”，是蒋介石卖国集团出卖台湾农业的工具。美国垄断资本通过这个机构，操纵了台湾的农业生产，对台湾农民进行殖民剥削。美国资本家垄断了台湾农业生产中不可缺少的化学肥料的生产与运销，以极高的价格将肥料卖给农民，进行残酷剥削。蒋介石卖国集团并与美国资本勾结，将它强占的土地组织所谓“合作农场”，用美国的机械和台湾农民的廉价劳动力，榨取巨额利润。此外，蒋介石卖国集团并强制台湾农民将大量稻田改种对美国资本最有利的甘蔗和樟脑，使台湾的经济成为依赖于美国的殖民地化经济。
    台湾已成为美国过剩商品的倾销市场。据蒋匪报纸透露的数字，从一九五零年到一九五四年六月这段期间，美国仅以“物资援助”方式在台湾倾销的商品即达两亿九千余万美元，相当于台湾这个时期进口结汇额的百分之六十五以上。蒋介石卖国集团并奉行美国的命令，使台湾的经济与日本的经济互相依赖，组成美国在亚洲的殖民地经济体系，以便为美国在远东的侵略计划和殖民地掠夺计划服务。按照这个计划，台湾的农产品主要向日本输出，而日本的轻工业品则大量输入台湾。蒋介石卖国集团的这种措施，加深了台湾经济的依赖性，严重地摧残了台湾本地工业的发展。
    蒋介石卖国集团出卖台湾、把台湾变为美国军事基地和殖民地的罪行，以及美国资本和蒋贼官僚无穷尽的压榨，使台湾人民遭受到越来越大的苦难。
    经济殖民地化、沉重的军费负担以及庞大的军事官僚机构的横征暴敛，是台湾人民生活日益困苦的直接原因。即使有了美国主子的“援助”，蒋介石卖国集团的财政也不断出现赤字。匪“中国新闻”报承认：一九五四至一九五五财政年度中将有接近五千万美元的赤字。为了挽救财政危机，蒋介石卖国集团一再加紧搜括台湾人民，苛捐杂税达到历史上最高纪录。五年来蒋匪帮不断提高税率和增加新税目，据蒋匪报纸透露，蒋匪一九四九年的税收额为伪币五千三百多万元，一九五三年增为十九亿八千多万元，共增加了三十六倍多。今年以来，税收额仍在不断增加。同时，由于美国和日本商品向台湾倾销，台湾的对外贸易造成了巨大的入超。如一九五三年十月，不连“美援”进口在内，台湾对外贸易入超仍达八百六十一万美元，超过全月出口的总值。蒋介石卖国集团为了挽救由于入超增加而造成的外汇缺乏，不顾人民生活需要，把许多原在台湾已感缺乏的物资拚命向外输出。为了增加大米的出口，这个卖国集团竟强迫台湾人民以番薯代替一部分大米充饥。为了弥补赤字亏空，这个卖国集团并采取增发钞票的办法。这样就造成了周期性的通货膨胀。加上因拚命向外输出所造成的物资枯竭，台湾的物价特别是人民生活必需品的价格不断上涨。
    在美国和蒋介石卖国集团的双重压榨下，台湾人民陷于十分悲惨的境遇。劳动人民由于重税、物价高涨、收入微薄，已陷于饥饿和死亡的深渊。就连蒋介石卖国集团“行政院”“国营事业考察团”一九五一年三月的报告也承认：“高待遇的工人，亦不能维持其家庭生活。”据蒋匪台湾“防痨协会主席”承认，在台湾，每四十三分钟就有一个人因肺病而死去。
    除了极少数的蒋匪官僚外，一般匪军公教人员的生活也十分困苦。匪军士兵生活更是恶劣。一九五二年七月号美国“外事”季刊刊载莱文霍特的“台湾现况”一文承认：在蒋匪军队中，“许多士兵害着病，特别是结核病。”
    台湾人民除了遭受饥饿的威胁外，更受到蒋介石卖国集团残酷的镇压与迫害。蒋介石卖国集团依靠美国刺刀的庇护，在台湾实行了恐怖的法西斯统治。这个卖国集团的军队、宪兵和警察不断进行大规模的搜查、逮捕与屠杀。台湾爱国志士和无辜人民受到血腥的迫害。这个卖国集团在各工厂、学校和伪政府机关、军队、团体中实行的所谓“联保办法”，更使人人自危，造成了极端恐怖的气氛。在蒋介石卖国集团的统治下台湾已成为暗无天日的恐怖世界。
    蒋介石卖国集团出卖台湾以及勾结美国掠夺与蹂躏我国台湾同胞的滔天罪行，是六万万中国人民所绝对不能容忍的，也是全世界人民所一致反对的。中国人民一定要将台湾人民从蒋介石卖国集团奴役下解放出来，使他们回到祖国怀抱来过自由幸福的生活。
