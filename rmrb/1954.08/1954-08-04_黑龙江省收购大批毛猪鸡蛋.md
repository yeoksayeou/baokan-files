Heilongjiang Province Overfulfills First Half of the Year's Native Produce Purchase Plan

The Heilongjiang Province Native Produce Company and Food Company's native produce purchase plan for the first half of the year was fulfilled by 119% by the end of June. The amount of native produce purchased increased by 133.3% compared to the same period last year. In the first half of this year, the province purchased more than 100,000 head of hogs, an increase of 192% compared to the same period last year; and purchased 61.82 million eggs, an increase of 195% compared to the same period last year.

Because the purchase plans for hogs and eggs were overfulfilled in the first half of the year, the supply of non-staple foods to key projects and cities and forest areas in the province increased significantly compared to last year. In the first half of this year, the supply of hogs to Fularji, Qiqihar, Bei'an, and forest areas increased by 136% compared to the same period last year, and the supply of eggs increased by 58% compared to the same period last year. The supply of eggs and hogs to Shenyang, Yichun, and other places outside the province also increased by four times and ten times respectively compared to last year.
