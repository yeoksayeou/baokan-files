    Resolution Condemning US Imperialist Aggression Against China and Sabotage of Peace
    We, the representatives attending the National Conference of Chinese Christians, solemnly condemn the US imperialist aggression against our territory of Taiwan, its violation of justice in Korea by harming and plundering Chinese and Korean prisoners of war, its sabotage of the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, its conduct of hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific region, and its detention of our overseas Chinese and students in the United States, all of which infringe upon our national sovereignty, continue to create international tension, and threaten peace in Asia and the world.
    At a time when peace-loving people all over the world are joyfully welcoming the agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina and the further relaxation of international tensions, US imperialism is stepping up its use of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which is entrenched in Taiwan, to harass our coastal areas and engage in piracy. It is also preparing to conclude a so-called "bilateral treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, attempting to occupy our Taiwan for a long time as a base for plotting aggression against our mainland. Recently, US imperialism has been making every effort to cobble together a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, attempting to realize the plot of "Asians fighting Asians," and has openly dispatched fleets to invade our southern coastal areas. US planes even shot down two of our patrol planes over Hainan Island. These arrogant acts of aggression and provocation by US imperialism not only threaten our security but also endanger peace in Asia and the world.
    Taiwan is an inseparable part of our sacred territory, and the Chinese people will never allow US imperialism to occupy Taiwan. Liberating Taiwan is our Chinese internal affair and no foreign interference is allowed. We Chinese Christians must stand with the people of the whole country and fight for the liberation of Taiwan.
    We Chinese Christians who love our country and love peace feel particularly resentful of the US imperialist conspiracy to continue to use Christianity in Taiwan and elsewhere to invade our country. We must be vigilant against these evil activities of US imperialism. We must unite more closely and strive to build a church of our own for Chinese Christians.
    According to the teachings of Christ, we resolutely oppose war and support world peace. Our believers across the country must raise their voices for justice and actively participate in the great movement to defend world peace with practical actions.

    谴责美帝国主义侵略中国破坏和平的决议
    我们出席中国基督教全国会议的全体代表，严正地谴责美帝国主义侵略我国领土台湾，在朝鲜违反正义残害和劫夺中朝战俘，破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决，在太平洋地区进行氢弹试验，在美国扣留我国侨民和留学生等侵犯我国主权，继续制造国际紧张局势，威胁亚洲和世界和平的罪恶行为。
    目前正当全世界爱好和平的人民欢欣鼓舞地迎接日内瓦会议达成印度支那停战的协议、国际紧张局势得到进一步缓和的时候，美帝国主义却加紧利用盘踞台湾的蒋介石匪帮，骚扰我国沿海地区，从事海盗活动。它又准备与蒋介石匪帮订定所谓“双边条约”，企图长期侵占我们的台湾，作为阴谋侵犯我国大陆的基地。最近美帝国主义又竭力拼凑东南亚侵略集团，妄图实现“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋，并公然派遣舰队侵入我国南部沿海地区，美国飞机更在海南岛上空击落我国巡逻机两架，美帝国主义这些侵略和挑衅的狂妄举动，不但威胁我国的安全，也危害了亚洲和世界的和平。
    台湾是我国神圣领土的一部分，中国人民决不容许美帝国主义侵占台湾，解放台湾是我们中国的内政，不许外国干涉。我们中国基督徒一定要和全国人民在一起，为解放台湾而奋斗。
    我们热爱祖国热爱和平的中国基督徒对美帝国主义在台湾等地继续利用基督教侵略我国的阴谋，尤其感到痛恨。我们对美帝国主义这些罪恶活动要提高警惕。我们更要团结一致，为建立中国基督徒自己的教会而努力。
    根据基督的教训，我们坚决反对战争，拥护世界和平。我们全国信徒要为此发出正义的呼声，并以实际行动积极参加保卫世界和平的伟大运动。
