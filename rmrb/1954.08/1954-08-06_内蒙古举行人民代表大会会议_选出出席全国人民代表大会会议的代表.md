    Inner Mongolia Holds People's Congress Meeting
    Elects Deputies to Attend National People's Congress Meeting
    [This newspaper's Hohhot dispatch, August 5th] The first session of the First People's Congress of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was solemnly held in Hohhot City from July 27th to August 4th. The 369 people's representatives present included ten ethnic groups, including Mongol, Han, Hui, Manchu, Korean, Oroqen, and Tibetan. The meeting fully demonstrated the spirit of friendship and unity among all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Liu Lantao, Chairman of the North China Administrative Committee, attended the meeting on behalf of the State Council of the Central People's Government and the North China Administrative Committee to provide guidance. All the representatives were greatly encouraged and believed that this was the central government's kind concern for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The meeting warmly discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and unanimously adopted the resolution on supporting the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The resolution held that the Draft Constitution reflected the common aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups in the country to build socialism, summarized the experience and achievements gained by our country in implementing the great ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party, and fixed this policy in legislative form, which fully conforms to the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Therefore, all representatives unanimously and enthusiastically supported the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and suggested that the National People's Congress adopt it.

    The meeting also heard and reviewed the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government's report on the implementation of several major tasks in the first half of 1954 and the arrangements for several major tasks in the second half of the year, and made a resolution unanimously agreeing to the government's report on the implementation of the work in the first half of the year. The meeting also believed that the government's arrangements for several major tasks in the second half of the year were correct and should be continued by the government. The conference also called on the people of the entire region to implement the spirit of unity and construction and do a good job in various construction tasks in the second half of the year. In view of the fact that the main construction projects of local state-owned new construction and expansion have been placed in the second half of the year, with short construction time, heavy tasks, and lack of experience, the conference requested relevant departments to do a good job in organization and mobilization to ensure the completion of the tasks. In terms of agricultural production, field management must be strengthened, and flood control and drainage work must be done well to turn possible good harvests into reality. In terms of animal husbandry production, it is necessary to conscientiously organize the work of grasping fatness and make full preparations for the winter and spring. The conference called on the people of all ethnic groups in the entire autonomous region to victoriously complete the tasks for 1954 and prepare conditions for various construction projects in 1955. All the representatives brought a total of 652 proposals related to various construction projects in the autonomous region. The Proposal Review Committee of the conference conducted serious research and proper handling of these proposals.

    Finally, the representatives attending the conference elected thirteen deputies to attend the National People's Congress meeting by secret ballot, including seven regional deputies and six ethnic deputies. The elected representatives are: Ulanhu, Su Qianyi, Fu Zuoyi, Kui Bi, Wang Zaitian, Wang Duo, Temuer BaGen, Ulan (female), Zhou Beifeng, Liu Xiumei (female), Hu Heletai, Wang Dianxing, and Gelasang.

    内蒙古举行人民代表大会会议
    选出出席全国人民代表大会会议的代表
    【本报呼和浩特五日电】内蒙古自治区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议于七月二十七日到八月四日在呼和浩特市隆重举行。到会的三百六十九名人民代表包括蒙、汉、回、满、朝鲜、鄂伦春、藏族等十个民族。会议充分显示了内蒙古自治区各民族友爱团结的精神。华北行政委员会主席刘澜涛代表中央人民政府政务院和华北行政委员会到会指导，全体代表受到很大鼓舞，认为这是中央对内蒙古自治区的亲切关怀。会议热烈地讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案，并一致通过了关于拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案的决议。决议认为宪法草案反映了全国各民族人民建设社会主义的共同愿望，总结了我国执行中国共产党伟大民族政策所获得的经验与成果，用立法形式把这一政策固定下来，这完全符合于全国各民族人民的利益。因此，全体代表一致热诚拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，并建议全国人民代表大会予以通过。
    会议还听取和审查了内蒙古自治区人民政府一九五四年上半年几项主要工作执行情况和下半年几项主要工作部署的报告，并作出决议，一致同意政府上半年工作执行情况的报告。会议也认为政府对今年下半年几项主要工作的部署是正确的，应由政府继续努力贯彻实施。大会并号召全区人民贯彻团结建设的精神，作好下半年的各项建设工作。会议鉴于地方国营的新建与扩建的基本建设的主要工程已放在后半年，施工时间短、任务重、经验不足，要求有关部门很好进行组织工作与动员工作，以保证完成任务。在农业生产方面，必须加强田间管理，作好防汛防涝等工作，把可能的丰收变为现实。牧业生产方面，必须认真地组织抓膘工作，并为过冬过春做好充分的准备。大会号召全自治区各民族人民胜利完成一九五四年任务，并为一九五五年各项建设准备条件。全体代表们共带来有关自治区各项建设的提案六百五十二件。大会的提案审查委员会对这些提案都作了认真的研究和妥善的处理。
    最后，出席大会的代表，用无记名投票方式选出了出席全国人民代表大会会议的十三名代表，其中地区代表七人，民族代表六人。当选的代表是：乌兰夫、苏谦益、傅作义、奎璧、王再天、王铎、特木尔巴根、乌兰（女），周北峰、刘秀梅（女）、胡和勒泰、王殿兴、噶喇藏。
