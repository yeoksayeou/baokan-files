The order stated: "Nishiikenichi and 417 other former Japanese soldiers all participated in the Japanese invaders' war of aggression against China in the past, and committed various crimes during the war; after the Japanese invaders surrendered, they joined the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops and continued to be enemies of the Chinese people, and their crimes were serious." The order continued: "The above-mentioned 417 former Japanese soldiers who have committed various crimes should have been given the punishment they deserve, but in view of the fact that they have been under control for three to five years and have confessed their crimes during the period of control, therefore, in accordance with the lenient policy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Nishiikenichi and 417 others are hereby pardoned." After this order was announced to Nishiikenichi and other former Japanese soldiers, they were all extremely happy and expressed extraordinary gratitude for the lenient policy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
