    Japanese People Strive for Friendship with New China
  　Lan Hai
    Recently, the voices of the Japanese people demanding the restoration of normal relations between Japan and China have become louder, and the movement to strive for friendship with the Chinese people has become more extensive.
    As early as October 1950, prominent Japanese figures of peace and democracy, such as Ikua Oyama, Yoshitaro Hirano, and Kanzo Uchiyama, with the support of the Japanese people, initiated the establishment of a mass organization of the Japanese people striving for friendship with China—the Japan-China Friendship Association. From the beginning, the US-Japanese reactionaries subjected this progressive Japanese people's organization to various persecutions. They instructed reactionary newspapers to viciously slander the Japan-China Friendship Association. Workers who participated in the Association were unreasonably dismissed by monopoly capitalists. In November and December of 1950, the police authorities of the Yoshida government even illegally searched the Osaka branch of the Association and the Tokyo headquarters, successively arresting five people, including the Secretary-General of the Association, Masamoto Ozawa, and handed them over to the US military court on the "crime" of "defaming" the American occupation forces, sentencing them to imprisonment. Despite this, the Japanese people's movement to strive for friendship with China developed day by day in the struggle against persecution, and the local organizations of the Japan-China Friendship Association also continued to expand. Up to now, about 160 branches of the Association have been established in various parts of Japan, and seven cities including Tokyo and Osaka have formed a joint federation of branches. The Japan-China Friendship Association has become a significant force in the Japanese people's movement to strive for friendship with China.
    In the nearly four years, the Japanese people's movement to strive for friendship with China has achieved considerable results.
    With the joint efforts of the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japanese Red Cross Society, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee and the Chinese Red Cross Society, 26,000 Japanese nationals residing in China have returned to Japan, 3,000 Chinese nationals residing in Japan have safely returned to their motherland, and the remains of 1,341 martyrs who sacrificed in Japan during the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan have also been sent back to our country.
    Despite the Yoshida government's unreasonable obstruction, more than 200 representatives of various Japanese delegations visited China last year alone. Representatives who visited China and returned Japanese nationals reported the true situation of New China to the Japanese people. The Japan-China Friendship Association also invited returning representatives and Japanese nationals to hold lectures and forums on Chinese issues, systematically introducing New China to the Japanese people, powerfully exposing the shameless slanders and rumors of the US-Japanese reactionaries against New China. Last year alone, 70,000 people participated in lectures on Chinese issues and 30,000 people participated in forums on Chinese issues.
    The "Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference" organized under the initiative of the Japan-China Friendship Association soon became an important force for the Japanese people to promote Japan-China trade. More than 60 prefectures and cities have established local branches of the "Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference." In November last year, the Japan-China Friendship Association and representatives of many Japanese trade organizations, as well as workers, farmers, and small and medium-sized enterprises, formed the "Japan-China Trade National Conference" to promote Japan-China trade. Now, the Japanese people's call for breaking free from the shackles of the US "embargo" and conducting autonomous trade with China has developed into a nationwide mass movement. Japanese trade representatives have visited China several times and signed trade agreements twice, and trade between the two countries has also increased.
    The great achievements of the Chinese people's liberation and construction cause have brought infinite encouragement to the Japanese people. The Japanese people, who are fighting for national independence, peace, and democracy, urgently demand to understand China and learn from China. The theoretical works and culture and art of the Chinese people have been widely introduced to Japan. According to statistics from the Japan-China Friendship Association, as of May this year, 45 kinds of Chinese social science works have been translated into Japanese and published, with 292,000 copies issued, and 74 kinds of literary works, with 277,500 copies issued. Among them, the Selected Works of Mao Zedong is most loved by Japanese readers. Six volumes have been published and a total of 150,000 copies have been sold. The Japanese version of "People's China" and "People's Pictorial" published in Beijing are widely welcomed by the Japanese people. The Japan-China Friendship Association has also published regular publications such as "Japan and China" and "Chinese Affairs" and series such as "Trade Unions in New China," "On Japan-China Friendship," and "Children and Schools in New China" to systematically introduce New China.
    The 12 films presented by China to the Japanese people, such as "Steel Warrior," "The White-Haired Girl," and "The Red Flag on Cui Gang," although they cannot be publicly screened in cinemas due to the Yoshida government's ban, are shown at large and small gatherings, and every show is full. Last year alone, the audience hosted by the Japan-China Friendship Association reached 260,000. Chinese dramas "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" and "Dragon Beard Ditch" are performed not only in Japanese cities but also in rural areas. The "Forward Troupe" performed the play "Qu Yuan" 264 times between November 1952 and August last year alone, with a total audience of 220,000, and held 340 forums.
    Chinese music and art are also widely spread in Japan. Xian Xinghai's "Chinese Rhapsody" and "Yellow River Cantata" and Ma Sicong's "Motherland Cantata" have all been performed publicly in Japan. The "Chinese Music Research Association" holds weekly "Singing Meetings" to introduce Chinese songs. The Japanese translation of the "Collection of New Chinese Songs" has been published to the third issue. Recently, the "Society for the Study of Modern China" held a "Modern Chinese Music Appreciation Concert." Chinese Yangko dance is also performed at many gatherings throughout Japan. Chinese photo exhibitions featuring Chinese photos, Chinese New Year pictures, prints, and art exhibitions are all universally and enthusiastically welcomed by the broad masses of the Japanese people.
    Learning Chinese language has become a craze in Japan, and new Chinese language learning groups and lectures are constantly being established in various places. Waseda University, Keio University, Tokyo Women's University, and Kawasaki and Yokohama High Schools, which do not have Chinese language courses, have all established Chinese language learning groups. The "Chinese Language Friends Association" has a very wide range of members and has published 29 issues of the language learning magazine "Chinese Language." The "Chinese Linguistics Research Association" also publishes regular learning publications. The radio Chinese language lectures held by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation have continued since they began last year, and many people listen and learn.
    The Japanese people's movement to strive for friendship with China is particularly powerfully manifested in the struggle against the US-Japanese reactionaries' signing of the San Francisco unilateral treaty, against the Japan-Chiang "peace treaty," and demanding the restoration of normal diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union. The broad masses of the Japanese people resolutely oppose the San Francisco unilateral treaty signed by the US-Japanese reactionaries. On February 10, 1952, the Japan-China Friendship Association issued a statement condemning the Yoshida government's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan. Last April, the "League for the Promotion of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Adjustment" organized by the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, the Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference, and the Japan-China Trade Promotion Diet Members Alliance has played an important role in the Japanese people's movement to strive for the restoration of normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and China.
    From the end of June to the beginning of July this year, hundreds of thousands of Japanese people responded to the "Japan-China Friendship Tanabata Festival Movement" initiated by the Japan-China Friendship Association, writing their wishes for friendship between Japan and China on colorful paper Tanabata slips according to ancient customs, and sending them to the Japan-China Friendship Association to decorate them on bamboo trees.
    Just as the Japanese people's movement to strive for friendship with China was rising, from July 9 to 11, more than 500 representatives and guests of the Japan-China friendship movement from all over Japan held the "Fourth National Convention of the Japan-China Friendship Association" in Osaka, the economic center of Japan. In response to the current situation in which the broad masses of the people eagerly demand friendship with China, the conference, with the goal of restoring normal relations between Japan and China, adopted the conference declaration and resolutions, and determined the future direction of the movement. This annual meeting is of great significance for further promoting the friendly movement between the people of Japan and China.
    The number of representatives and guests at the Fourth National Convention of the Japan-China Friendship Association and the breadth of representation were unprecedented. Everywhere in the venue were decorated bamboo trees adorned with colorful paper slips inscribed with the Japanese people's wishes for Japan-China friendship, vividly demonstrating the Japanese people's firm will to strive for friendship with China. At the meeting, the representatives unanimously pointed out that due to the development of the international situation, especially the China-India and China-Burma talks pointing out important principles for peace in Asia, it has become even more important for Japan to restore normal relations with China. Therefore, the broad masses of the Japanese people eagerly demand friendship with China, strengthen cultural exchanges between the two countries, and promote Japan-China trade. Reports from local representatives also explained that the Japan-China friendship movement is rapidly expanding in various places recently. For example, in Yamaguchi Prefecture, 80,000 members of the Trade Union Council collectively joined the Japan-China Friendship Association as group members; in Hokkaido, the number of readers of the Japanese versions of "People's China" and "People's Pictorial" is increasing every month; and a branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association was newly established in Hakodate City on June 27.
    The Japanese people's movement to strive for friendship with China is playing an increasingly widespread influence. The Fourth National Convention of the Japan-China Friendship Association received congratulatory telegrams and letters from many groups and individuals at home and abroad, such as the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. The congratulatory letter from the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party pointed out that the Japanese people's demand to strengthen cultural and economic exchanges with China, and to invite a delegation from the Chinese Red Cross to visit Japan in order to thank the Chinese people for their good intentions and assistance in the repatriation of Japanese nationals residing in China, has developed into an irresistible force. The congratulatory letter called on people from all walks of life in Japan, regardless of party affiliation or belief, to unite in the pursuit of Japan-China friendship and launch a large-scale people's movement.
    At present, the Japanese people's movement to strive for friendship with China is unfolding widely. On the evening of July 10, 1,500 representatives and citizens, workers and small and medium-sized entrepreneurs from Osaka City who participated in the Fourth National Convention of the Japan-China Friendship Association held a "National Convention for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations." The conference passed a declaration and resolutions, demanding: the restoration of diplomatic relations with China, the cancellation of trade restrictions, the invitation of a delegation from the Chinese Red Cross to visit Japan, freedom of entry and exit, and guaranteeing the rights of Chinese nationals residing in Japan. On August 1, seven groups, including the "Diet Members League for Promoting Japan-China Trade," jointly held the "National Convention for Promoting Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Economic Exchange" in Hakodate City, Hokkaido, demanding the cancellation of all trade restrictions between Japan and peaceful democratic countries, and holding a national convention to promote the movement to develop free trade with China and the Soviet Union. The national organization of the Japan-China Friendship Association is fully preparing to hold the "Japan-China Friendship Month" from September 15 to October 31 in accordance with the resolutions of the Fourth National Convention. During the "Japan-China Friendship Month," various activities will be launched to promote Japan-China cultural exchange, autonomous trade, and other activities to strengthen Japan-China friendship, including investigating and studying the Xu Fu Mausoleum discovered near Kumano Shrine in Wakayama Prefecture, and launching a movement to build a memorial monument to the Chinese musician Nie Er on Kugenuma Beach (note: On July 17, 1935, the young Chinese musician Nie Er unfortunately drowned while swimming at Kugenuma Beach in Japan), calling on relevant parties to assist in completing the monument by the 20th anniversary of Nie Er's death next year.
    Under the resolute demands of the Japanese people to strive for friendship with China, the Yoshida government has been forced to formally agree on August 3 to the invitation of a delegation from the Chinese Red Cross to visit Japan by the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japanese Red Cross Society, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee.
    The Japanese people's struggle for national independence, peace, and democracy, to get rid of the shackles of the United States, and to live in friendship with the great neighbor, the Chinese people, and to develop economic exchanges and autonomous trade between the two countries is completely legitimate and has won the sympathy and support of the Chinese people. The Japanese people's movement to strive for friendship with the Chinese people cannot be stopped by any force.

    日本人民争取和新中国友好
  　蓝海
    日本人民要求日本和中国恢复正常关系的呼声，最近更加高涨，争取和中国人民友好的运动更加扩展起来。
    早在一九五○年十月，日本著名的和平民主人士大山郁夫、平野义太郎、内山完造等就在日本人民的支持下发起成立了日本人民争取和中国友好的群众性团体——日本中国友好协会。美日反动派自始就对这个进步的日本人民团体横加迫害。他们指使反动报纸对日中友协进行恶毒的诬蔑。参加日中友协的工人受到垄断资本家的无理解雇。一九五○年十一、十二月间，吉田政府警察当局更非法搜查大阪的日中友协分会和东京的日中友协总会，先后逮捕了日中友协事务局长小泽正元等五人，以“诽谤”美国占领军的“罪名”，把他们移交美国军事法庭判处了徒刑。尽管如此，日本人民争取和中国友好的运动却在反抗迫害的斗争中日益发展，日中友协的地方组织也不断扩展起来。到目前止，日本各地已经成立了约一百六十个日中友协分会，东京、大阪等七个都市并组成了分会联合会，日中友协已成为日本人民争取和中国友好运动的重大力量了。
    将近四年来，日本人民争取和中国友好的运动，取得了相当大的成果。
    在日中友协、日本红十字会和日本和平联络委员会与中国红十字会的共同努力下，两万六千名旅华日侨回到了日本，三千名旅日华侨安返祖国，中国抗日战争期间牺牲在日本的一千三百四十一位烈士的骨灰也已送回我国。
    尽管有吉田政府的蛮横留难，但只去年一年间，日本各种代表团到中国的代表就有二百多人。访问过中国的代表和回国的日侨，向日本人民报告了新中国的真实情况。日中友协并邀请回国的代表和日侨举办中国问题演讲会和座谈会，系统地向日本人民介绍新中国，有力地揭穿了美日反动派对新中国的无耻诬蔑和造谣。去年一年中就有七万人参加了中国问题演讲会、三万人参加了中国问题座谈会。
    在日中友协发起下组织的“日中贸易促进会议”，成立后不久就成为日本人民促进日中贸易的重要力量，六十个以上的县、市都已成立了“日中贸易促进会议”的地方分会。去年十一月，日中友协和日本许多贸易团体，以及工人、农民、中小企业者等团体的代表更组成了“日中贸易国民会议”，促进日中贸易。现在，日本人民要求挣脱美国的“禁运”镣铐、和中国进行自主贸易的呼声，已经发展成为全国性的群众运动，日本贸易代表已经数次前往中国，两次签订了贸易协议，两国间的贸易也有了增加。
    中国人民的解放事业和建设事业的伟大成就，给日本人民带来无限的鼓舞。正在为民族独立、和平与民主而斗争的日本人民迫切地要求了解中国、学习中国。中国人民的理论著作和文化艺术广泛地被介绍到日本。据日中友协统计，到今年五月止，翻译成日文出版的中国社会科学著作已有四十五种、发行二十九万二千册，文学著作七十四种、发行二十七万七千五百册。其中以毛泽东选集最为日本读者所热爱，现已出版了六卷，共销行了十五万册。北京出版的日文版“人民中国”和“人民画报”受到日本人民的普遍欢迎。日中友协并出版了“日本与中国”、“中国事情”等定期刊物和“新中国的工会”、“论日中友好”、“新中国的儿童和学校”等丛书，系统地介绍新中国。
    中国赠予日本人民的“钢铁战士”、“白毛女”、“翠岗红旗”等十二部电影，虽然由于吉田政府的禁止，不能公开在电影院上映，但在大、小集会上的招待映出，场场客满，去年一年中，由日中友协招待的观众就达二十六万人。中国话剧“小二黑结婚”、“龙须沟”不但在日本各都市而且也在农村中演出。“屈原”一剧，仅一九五二年十一月到去年八月的十个月间，“前进座”剧团即上演了二百六十四场，观众共达二十二万人，并举行了三百四十次座谈会。
    中国音乐和美术也在日本广泛传播，冼星海的“中国狂想曲”、“黄河大合唱”，马思聪的“祖国大合唱”都曾在日本公开演奏。“中国音乐研究会”举办每周一次的“歌咏会”介绍中国歌曲，译成日文的“新中国歌曲集”已出版到第三期。最近，“现代中国学会”又举办了“现代中国音乐欣赏会”。中国秧歌舞也在日本各地许多集会上演出。以中国照片为主的中国图片展览会，中国年画、版画以及美术品的展览会，都受到日本广大人民普遍而热烈的欢迎。
    在日本学习中国语文已经成为热潮，各地不断有新的中国语文学习小组、讲习会成立。没有中国语文科的早稻田大学、庆应大学、东京女子大学以及川崎、横滨高等学校都已成立了中国语文学习组。“中国语友会”的会员阶层极其广泛，已刊行了语文学习杂志“中国语”二十九期。“中国语学研究会”也出版有定期的学习刊物。日本广播协会举办的广播华语讲座，从去年开始后继续至今，收听学习的人很多。
    日本人民争取和中国友好的运动，特别有力地表现在反对美日反动派签订旧金山片面和约，反对日蒋“和约”，要求和中国、苏联恢复正常外交关系的斗争中。日本广大人民坚决反对美日反动派签订的旧金山片面和约。一九五二年二月十日，日中友协发表声明，斥责吉田政府与台湾蒋匪帮媾和。去年四月，由日中友协、日苏亲善协会、日中贸易促进会议、日中贸易促进议员联盟所发起组织的“日中、日苏邦交调整促进同盟”，已在日本人民争取日本和苏联、中国恢复正常关系运动中发挥了重要作用。
    今年六月底到七月初，日本人民成千上万地响应了日中友协发起的“日中友好七巧节运动”，把他们对日中两国友好的心愿，按照古时的习俗，写在彩色纸做成的七巧签上，寄给日中友协，把它扎饰在竹子树上。
    正当日本人民争取和中国友好运动日益高涨的时候，七月九日到十一日，来自日本各地的数达五百多名的日中友好运动的代表和来宾们，在日本经济中心城市大阪举行了“日中友好协会第四届全国大会”。大会针对广大人民热切要求和中国友好的当前情况，以恢复日中两国正常关系为目标，通过了大会宣言和决议，并确定了今后的运动方针。这次年会对进一步推动日中两国人民的友好运动，具有重要意义。
    日中友协第四届全国大会的代表和来宾人数之多，和代表性的广泛，都是空前的。会场中到处布置了扎饰着写有日本人民要求日中友好心愿的彩色纸签的竹子树，生动地显示出日本人民争取和中国友好的坚决意志。会上，代表们的发言一致指出，由于国际局势的发展特别是中印、中缅会谈给亚洲的和平指出了重要原则，对于日本来说，和中国恢复正常关系已经更加重要。因而，日本广大人民热切要求和中国友好，加强两国文化交流和促进日中贸易。各地方代表的报告并说明最近各地日中友好运动正在迅速扩展。例如，在山口县，工会评议会的八万会员集体参加了日中友协为团体会员；在北海道，“人民中国”“人民画报”日文本的读者每月都在增加；函馆市并在六月二十七日新成立了日中友协分会。
    日本人民争取和中国友好的运动，正在起着日益广泛的影响。日中友协第四届全国大会收到了中国人民对外文化协会等来自国外及国内的许多团体和个人的贺电贺信。日本共产党中央指导部的贺信中指出，日本人民要求加强和中国进行文化、经济交流，以及为了答谢中国人民在旅华日侨回国等方面所给予的好意援助而要求邀请中国红十字会代表团访问日本，已经发展成为不可抗拒的力量。贺信并号召日本各阶层人士不分党派和信仰，在争取日中友好一点上团结一致，展开规模巨大的人民运动。
    目前，日本人民争取和中国友好的运动正在广泛展开。七月十日晚间，参加日中友协第四届全国大会的代表和大阪市的工人、市民、中小企业者一千五百人，举行了“恢复日中邦交国民大会”。大会通过宣言和决议，要求：恢复和中国的邦交，取消贸易限制，邀请中国红十字会代表团访问日本，出入国境应享有自由，保证旅日华侨的权利。八月一日，日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”等七个团体，在北海道函馆市联合举行了“促进日中、日苏经济交流全国大会”，要求取消日本与和平民主国家的一切贸易限制，举行全国大会推进和中国、苏联发展自由贸易的运动。日中友协在全国的组织正在按照第四届全国大会的决议，全力准备举办九月十五日起至十月三十一日止的“日中友好月”，在“日中友好月”中，将展开多种多样的促进日中文化交流、自主贸易等加强日中友好的活动，其中并包括调查研究和歌山县熊野神宫附近发现的徐福陵墓，和展开在鹄沼海岸建立中国音乐家聂耳记念碑运动（按：一九三五年七月十七日，中国青年音乐家聂耳在日本鹄沼海滨游泳时不幸溺死），呼吁有关方面协助，以期在明年聂耳逝世二十周年祭日建成。
    在日本人民争取和中国友好的坚决要求下，吉田政府已被迫在八月三日正式同意日中友协、日本红十字会和日本和平联络委员会邀请中国红十字会代表团访问日本。
    日本人民为了民族独立、和平与民主，争取摆脱美国的束缚，和伟大邻邦中国人民友好相处、发展两国之间的经济交流和自主贸易，是完全正当的，得到了中国人民的同情和支持。日本人民争取和中国人民友好的运动，是任何力量都不能加以阻挡的。
