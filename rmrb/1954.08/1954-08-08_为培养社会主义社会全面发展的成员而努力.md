Striving to Cultivate Well-Rounded Members of Socialist Society
Dong Chuncai, Vice Minister of Education, Central People's Government

I.

"A certain form of politics and economics is the primary determinant of that certain form of culture" (Mao Zedong: On New Democracy). This is a Marxist truth that explains history and reality. Education, under various different socio-economic forms, changes its nature, purpose, content, and methods. Therefore, education in each different historical stage has its different characteristics. The nature of education changes along with changes in politics and economics.

The founding of the People's Republic of China marks the basic end of the first stage of the Chinese revolution and the beginning of the second stage, that is, the basic end of the New Democratic revolution stage and the beginning of the Socialist revolution stage. The task of the first stage of the Chinese revolution was to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and to establish a New Democratic society. The task of the second stage is to build a socialist society in China.

In the first stage of the Chinese revolution, the education implemented in the liberated areas was New Democratic education. New Democratic education was an integral part of the New Democratic revolutionary movement, with New Democracy as its content, and serving the New Democratic revolution. At that time, the Kuomintang-ruled areas implemented feudal, comprador, fascist education, which took feudalism, compradorism, and fascism as its content, and served feudalism, compradorism, and fascism, which was opposed by the masses of people at that time.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, our revolutionary movement began to shift to the stage of socialist revolution. Our education cause has become an integral part of the national construction cause under the leadership of the working class. In the transition period, it serves the realization of the general task, the construction of a socialist society, is an indispensable and powerful tool for realizing the general task, and is an integral part of the socialist construction cause.

In the first stage of the Chinese revolution, the main contradiction in our society was the contradiction between the masses of people and imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. This contradiction, reflected on the cultural front, is the contradiction between the cultural thought of New Democracy and the cultural thought of feudalism, compradorism, and fascism. Opposing the cultural thoughts of feudalism, compradorism, and fascism was the main task of New Democratic education at that time.

In the second stage of the Chinese revolution, the main class contradiction within the country is the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. This class contradiction, reflected on the ideological front, is the contradiction between the cultural thought of socialism and the cultural thought of capitalism. Developing socialist cultural thought, opposing capitalist cultural thought, this is the main task of socialist education. In the first few years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, because the thoughts of feudalism, compradorism, and fascism left a deep influence among the people, at that time, it was still necessary to concentrate forces to eliminate this reactionary ideological poison, to complete the unfinished tasks of the New Democratic revolution. Now, our school education should actively develop socialist cultural thought, thoroughly criticize capitalist cultural thought, and further eliminate the remnants of feudal, comprador, and fascist thought.

In summary, in the first stage of the Chinese revolution, our education (mainly education in the liberated areas) took New Democracy as its content and served the New Democratic revolution. In the second stage of the Chinese revolution, our education takes socialism as its content and serves the construction of a socialist society.

II.

Primary and secondary school education is general education; at present, primary school education in our country is compulsory national education; at a certain period, under certain conditions, secondary school education will also become compulsory education. According to the requirements of national construction during the transition period, after completing compulsory education, citizens should engage in productive labor, with only a small number of people going on to higher education.

What are the goals and tasks of primary and secondary school education? The goal and task of primary and secondary school education is to cultivate well-rounded members of socialist society, that is, conscious and active builders of socialist society and defenders of the great motherland. According to the current actual situation in our country, secondary school education should not only supply higher education institutions with sufficient qualified new students but also supply national production and construction with a new force with a certain degree of political awareness, cultural cultivation, and physical health. Therefore, graduates of primary and secondary schools, in addition to a portion of people going on to higher education according to national needs, the majority should actively engage in industrial and agricultural productive labor or other construction work.

“Cultivating well-rounded members of socialist society” – on what basis is this educational task proposed? It is proposed based on the general task of our country during the transition period and the requirements of building a socialist society. If our country is to be built into a great socialist country, our school education should serve this great general task, shoulder the heavy responsibility of cultivating builders and defenders of the socialist country. The builder of socialist society must be a new person with all-round development of personality. This new person should have a healthy development both physically and mentally, possess a socialist political direction, a dialectical materialist worldview, communist morality, a certain scientific and cultural cultivation, and a healthy physique. This new person should follow Chairman Mao's instructions and achieve "good health, good study, good work." This all-round development of personality, whether under the slave system, under the feudal system, or under the capitalist system, is impossible to achieve. "National oppression and feudal oppression cruelly restrict the development of the Chinese people's personality" (Mao Zedong: On Coalition Government). In class society, with the division of labor, the separation and opposition between physical labor and mental labor are formed. The broad masses of working people engage in heavy physical labor, they are oppressed and exploited, it is impossible to receive education, lack cultural cultivation, and are in a state of ignorance and backwardness for a long time. And a small number of people engaged in mental labor do not engage in physical labor, and do not have the habit and ability to engage in this kind of labor. They learn some book knowledge, but often they cannot apply it. Bourgeois schools are "forcing students to master a large pile of useless, cumbersome, rigid knowledge, which blocks the minds of young people and turns them into mediocre and incompetent officials" (Lenin: The Tasks of the Youth Leagues). Landlords and the bourgeoisie are all cultivating a part of young people into weak scholars and bookworms who are "unaccustomed to physical labor and unable to distinguish the five grains." From this, it can be seen that in the old society, under the exploitative system, it is impossible for people's personalities to be developed in an all-round way. Only in the new society can the all-round development of personality begin to be realized; in socialist society, after the elimination of exploitation, the elimination of antagonism between classes, and the disappearance of the antagonism between physical labor and mental labor, the all-round development of personality can be further realized. This has indeed been realized in the Soviet Union, and it will gradually be realized in our country with the elimination of capitalism and the exploitative system. As for eliminating the essential differences between physical labor and mental labor, that will be realized under the communist system, when the cultural technology of the entire working class is raised to the level of engineers. Now our country is gradually transitioning to socialist society, and the task facing our children and young people is to build a socialist society. In order to realize this task, it is required that the personalities of our new generation be developed in an all-round way, and that they have a healthy development both physically and mentally, that is to say, it is required that our new generation possess socialist thought, a certain cultural cultivation, and a healthy physique. Because only such new figures with all-round development are suitable to shoulder the glorious and great task of building a socialist society. Therefore, cultivating well-rounded members of socialist society has become the major historical task of our primary and secondary school education.

To cultivate new people with all-round development, it is necessary to implement education with all-round development. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, although we have proposed that our schools should implement education with all-round development, there are still some wavering phenomena in the implementation of this policy. Sometimes it leans to this aspect, and sometimes it leans to that aspect. During the Liberation War period and the early days of liberation, our secondary schools paid more attention to political and ideological education, which was in line with the requirements of the objective situation at the time, and it was necessary. The shortcoming at that time was the neglect of education in cultural and scientific knowledge. The formation of this bias was related to the thought of empiricism. In recent years, the central government has proposed that school education should focus on teaching. When some schools implemented the central government's instruction, they went to another extreme, only paying attention to the teaching of scientific knowledge, ignoring political and ideological education, forming a bias of neglecting politics. What is particularly serious is the neglect of labor education. There has been no systematic and profound criticism of the exploitative class thought of the old society that despised physical labor and working people, which is a matter of principle and should be our responsibility. Many schools have not paid much attention to the physical health of students, so that the current health of students is not very good. This is also a serious shortcoming in the current primary and secondary school education. Such a practice of attending to one thing and losing sight of another is an education of distorted development. We must strive to correct it.

Starting from the above-mentioned actual situation, in the current implementation of the education policy of all-round development, attention should be paid to correcting the above-mentioned biases, strengthening political and ideological education, especially strengthening labor education, improving teaching work, and improving sports and health work, so that students can develop physically and mentally in an all-round way. This is the basic requirement for improving the quality of secondary school education.

(1) Strengthening Political and Ideological Education

The task of political and ideological education is to educate students with socialist thought, with the thought of Marxism-Leninism, so that they can establish the socialist political direction and the foundation of a dialectical materialist worldview, and cultivate their communist morality. Establishing the socialist political direction means making students take the construction of socialist society and communist society as the goal of their lifelong struggle. Make them understand that today's study is to prepare for participating in this great construction cause. Cultivating the foundation of students' dialectical materialist worldview means making them develop a materialist view of natural phenomena and social life phenomena on the basis of scientific knowledge, in order to break various superstitious ideas and idealistic views. Cultivating students' communist morality means cultivating their patriotism, labor viewpoint, mass viewpoint, the spirit of cherishing public property, collectivism, conscious discipline, as well as good qualities such as perseverance, courage, humility, honesty, thrift, and simplicity. In order to complete the above-mentioned task of political and ideological education, it is necessary to educate students with socialist thought, and at the same time criticize bourgeois thought, criticize the thought of despising physical labor and working people, and continue to eliminate the remnants of feudal, comprador, and fascist thought. The three tasks of political and ideological education are closely linked and inseparable. The socialist political direction is based on a scientific worldview. If students can correctly understand the laws of social development, then they will inevitably establish a firm political belief and political direction -- the political direction of socialism and communism. On the other hand, communist morality must also be based on a scientific worldview. In fact, when we carry out political and ideological education, these three aspects are often intertwined and cannot be carried out in isolation.

According to the existing ideological situation of students, at present, in carrying out political and ideological education in secondary schools, special emphasis should be placed on strengthening patriotic education, labor education, and conscious discipline education.

1. Strengthening Patriotic Education. First, cultivate students' love for the motherland and their ambition to dedicate themselves to the socialist construction cause of the motherland, and prepare to work hard and sacrifice for the construction and defense of the motherland at any time. This can combine patriotic education with the socialist political direction; at the same time, it can also combine patriotic education with labor education. Second, strengthen students' national concept, so that they recognize the consistency between individual interests and national interests, and individual interests should be subordinate to national interests, and consciously abide by social order and national laws. This can combine patriotism with collectivism education and conscious discipline education. Third, pay attention to cultivating students' national self-esteem, self-confidence, and pride, and at the same time cultivate the spirit of internationalism, so that they have a spirit of unity, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation with the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and the people of other countries. Pay attention to preventing narrow nationalism and great-power chauvinism. This combines patriotic thought with the spirit of internationalism.
2. Strengthening Labor Education. It is necessary to strengthen regular (not rush) and comprehensive (not one-sided) labor education in schools at all levels. The main tasks of labor education: First, to cultivate students' socialist view of labor, so that they recognize the truth that labor creates human history, and that labor is the first necessary condition in human life, thereby regarding labor as a glorious career and as the primary responsibility to society, loving labor, respecting working people; overcome the exploitative class thought of despising physical labor and working people; second, to cultivate students' socialist labor attitude, consciously abide by labor discipline, and treat labor with a conscious and active attitude; third, to cultivate students' labor habits; fourth, to enable students to acquire basic knowledge and certain skills in industrial and agricultural production. When carrying out labor education, first, pay attention to closely linking it with other aspects of political and ideological education (such as patriotic education, collectivist education, etc.). It is not very effective to carry out labor education in isolation; second, pay attention to treating labor education as regular political and ideological education, and it is inappropriate to simply regard labor education as employment education, or as a temporary rush task for graduating students; third, pay attention to treating mental labor and physical labor as unified and interrelated education, and studying itself should be regarded as a main labor, and through the teaching of various subjects, students' labor viewpoint and diligent habits should be cultivated, and basic knowledge and skills in industrial and agricultural production should be acquired; at the same time, students should also be appropriately organized to participate in some extracurricular activities and physical labor within their capacity. The purpose of doing this is to make our students use both their hands and brains, and make mental labor and physical labor closely integrated. The view and practice of simply regarding labor education as physical labor, and believing that "labor education is doing heavy work," is wrong. At present, the view of despising physical labor and laborers that exists in many students, as well as some biases in labor education in many schools, should be corrected.
3. Strengthening Education in Conscious Discipline. The task of discipline education is to cultivate students' consciousness and enthusiasm for learning, consciously abide by school rules, maintain school order, respect teachers, cherish school property, respect collective interests, and cultivate the idea of abiding by social order and national laws. The task of discipline education is not only to ensure the smooth progress of the teaching process, but more importantly, to cultivate students' habit of consciously abiding by discipline, to prepare for abiding by labor discipline and military discipline in the future. Therefore, discipline education should be combined with patriotic education, collectivist education, and labor education. At present, some schools have bad phenomena such as students not respecting teachers, not abiding by school discipline, and not abiding by social order, which must be seriously overcome.

The methods of carrying out political and ideological education are mainly through the teaching of various subjects in class and various activities outside class. First, education should be carried out in connection with real life. In the past, we have carried out political and ideological education for students in connection with revolutionary struggles, various social reform movements, and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. This kind of education went deep into people's hearts and was very effective. In the future, we should absorb this experience and carry out political and ideological education in connection with the socialist construction and socialist transformation cause, and oppose education that is divorced from real life, and oppose the bias of reading behind closed doors. Second, education should be carried out in a targeted manner in connection with students' lives and ideological realities and according to the characteristics of young people. The method of empty preaching that disregards the actual thoughts of students will fail. Third, the basic method of political and ideological education is the "democratic method, that is, the method of persuasion, not the method of coercion" as Chairman Mao said. This is a fine tradition of people's education, that is, educating students from the positive side with correct ideological viewpoints, so that they can recognize the truth, distinguish between good and evil, and distinguish between right and wrong, and have something to follow in their actions. Attention should be paid to promoting the students' advantages and helping them overcome their weaknesses. Students' good behavior should be praised and encouraged; for students' wrong ideas and behaviors, neither can they be allowed to go their own way, nor can they be dealt with in a simple and crude way; they must be guided patiently, enlightened to their awareness, and given appropriate criticism to help them correct them. For those who really cannot be persuaded, appropriate means of punishment can be adopted, but this is only a supplementary method that must be adopted in order to achieve the purpose of education, so the bias of pure punishment must be prevented.

Political and ideological education mainly relies on teachers. Teaching cannot be separated from political and ideological content. Teachers should pay attention to political and ideological education in teaching, which means that teachers should pay attention to the ideological, political and scientific nature of teaching, rather than adding a political tail to each lesson in class, or teaching cultural classes as political classes. Therefore, in teaching, it is necessary to oppose both the tendency to ignore politics and the tendency to dogmatism. The teacher's own words and deeds have a subtle effect on the students' ideology, so the teacher should pay attention to setting an example for the students. The head teacher bears a very important responsibility for the political and ideological education of students, and the role of the head teacher should be valued. The Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers are indispensable and powerful assistants for schools to carry out education. They play a positive role in the political and ideological education of students. Schools should be good at obtaining the help of the League and teams to do a good job in political and ideological education, and the League and teams should also actively help the school work.

(2) Improving Teaching Work

Teaching is the central link of school education, and its purpose is to systematically teach students scientific knowledge step by step, and at the same time, to implement political and ideological education in teaching. At present, the knowledge level of our students is very low, and their thoughts are still very impure. We must take effective measures to arm students with socialist thought and systematic basic scientific knowledge, and improve their knowledge level and ideological awareness. To this end, we must improve our teaching work.

In the past few years, we have carried out preliminary teaching reforms. Our teaching reform is based on the experience of the old liberated areas, and attention is paid to learning the advanced theories and advanced experience of Soviet education. As early as the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Mao had instructed: "Revise the school system, abolish courses that are not urgently needed and unnecessary, change the management system, and take the principle of teaching courses necessary for the war and developing students' enthusiasm for learning." According to Chairman Mao's instructions, the primary and secondary schools in the old liberated areas first abolished the set of social science textbooks in the old Chinese primary and secondary schools, and replaced them with newly compiled textbooks with New Democracy as the content. In the natural sciences, the old textbooks with less ideological poison were selected, or they were adapted. In terms of teaching methods, attention began to be paid to linking with reality. After the founding of New China, in addition to the primary and secondary schools in the old liberated areas, we received a large number of old schools. According to the experience of the old liberated areas, we also first abolished the old liberal arts textbooks and replaced them with new textbooks (adapted from the textbooks of the old liberated areas as blueprints). Then we learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, formulated primary and secondary school teaching plans, and used the teaching syllabus and textbooks used by Soviet secondary schools as blueprints to compile teaching syllabus and adapt textbooks. The natural science textbooks currently used are based on Soviet textbooks as blueprints, and the social science textbooks are based on old liberated area textbooks. While reforming the teaching content, many schools have begun to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and reform teaching methods.

Although the teaching work of our primary and secondary schools has undergone a series of reforms, it is not thorough. In the future, it should be further improved to improve the quality of primary and secondary school education. According to the experience of the old liberated areas and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the following issues should be paid attention to in improving primary and secondary school teaching work at present: First, teaching must implement the principle of combining theory with practice. First, teaching should be combined with political struggle and serve political struggle; second, teaching should be combined with production and construction and serve production and construction. Lenin said, "If the education of the younger generation is not combined with productive labor, the ideal of future society cannot be imagined. Talking about education and teaching without productive labor, and talking about productive labor without corresponding education and teaching, cannot be raised to the height required by modern technology and scientific knowledge." In the past, primary and secondary school education in the old liberated areas paid more attention to this principle. In recent years, the teaching work of some schools has tended to be divorced from productive labor and neglect politics. This should be paid attention to and corrected.

Second, the reform of teaching should focus on the reform of teaching content, and correspondingly reform teaching methods. Only circling in the reform of teaching methods and neglecting the reform of teaching content puts the cart before the horse. Of course, if the teaching content is reformed, the teaching methods cannot be unreformed, otherwise the teaching tasks cannot be well completed.

Regarding the reform of teaching content, first of all, teachers are required to study the new textbooks, understand the teaching purpose of each lesson, grasp its central idea and central content, and, in accordance with the teaching purpose, correctly and systematically impart the ideological content and scientific content of the textbooks to students. We require teachers to gradually learn to use the viewpoints of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to give lectures, and require teachers to correctly impart scientific knowledge to students, and pay attention to implementing political and ideological education in classroom teaching. This requires teachers to appropriately collect and adopt practical materials for national construction to enrich the teaching content, and create conditions to manufacture teaching aids for intuitive teaching, so that students can conduct experiments and visits to consolidate and practice the knowledge they have learned.

One of the most basic tasks of improving teaching is to compile and print a complete set of teaching syllabus, textbooks, and teaching guidance books. The Central Ministry of Education has prepared to further adapt primary and secondary school teaching syllabus and textbooks according to the general task of the country during the transition period and the purpose of primary and secondary school education, from the perspective and method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, in accordance with the socialist education principles, and in combination with China's actual situation, and plans to compile a set of teaching guidance books for teachers. We plan to complete this ideological construction project within the first five-year plan period. At present, some textbooks are too heavy, which is the main reason for the excessive burden of students' homework. The Central Ministry of Education has formulated a streamlining plan for schools to refer to. First, the physics and history textbooks for the third grade of high school will be streamlined. The foreign language course in junior high school has been decided to be cancelled. We still need to study the streamlining of the textbooks for the remaining courses before making a decision.

Third, attention should be paid to overcoming dogmatism and formalism. Dogmatism and formalism are both the legacy of the old education of old China. In old-style schools, teaching was divorced from reality, and it was teaching students to read books to death. Some schools have not yet completely overcome this deeply rooted problem. Therefore, in the process of learning from the Soviet Union and reforming teaching, there is a tendency to be divorced from China's actual situation and mechanically apply Soviet experience. First of all, our secondary school teaching plan still has the problem of being unrealistic. Secondly, some schools learn from the Soviet Union's experience and pay more attention to the reform of teaching methods, and even circle in the reform of teaching methods blindly, ignoring the study of textbooks. These are all reflections of dogmatism and formalism, which must be corrected in the teaching reform in the future. However, it must be pointed out that our Central Ministry of Education has lacked clear ideological leadership and has not provided regular and specific guidance to schools' teaching reform in the past. Therefore, the problem of dogmatism and formalism in schools is related to our bureaucratic leadership style. This is something we should review.

Fourth, the ideological transformation of teachers is a necessary prerequisite for teaching reform. And teachers can transform and improve their thinking, especially educational thinking and academic thinking, through teaching reform. Therefore, in the future, ideological transformation should continue to be carried out for teachers in conjunction with improving teaching work.

(3) Pay Attention to Health Education

Paying attention to health education and enhancing students' physical fitness is an inseparable part of all-round development education. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao are extremely concerned about the health of students. The State Council of the Central People's Government made a "Decision on Improving the Health of Students at All Levels of Schools" as early as 1951. In recent years, although some work has been done to improve the health of students, and students' health has also improved to some extent, it is still very insufficient, and students' health is still not good enough. This shows that the implementation of the State Council's decision to improve students' health is very poor. The reason is that our educational administrative departments still have subjectivism and bureaucracy. Subjectivism is mainly manifested in the fact that some of our textbooks are too heavy, which increases the burden of students' study. Bureaucracy is manifested in the fact that we lack supervision and inspection of the implementation of the State Council's decision. In terms of school administration, not enough attention is paid to the health of students, and the idea of all-round development education is not clear enough. In terms of teachers, there is also a phenomenon of disregarding students' ability to accept, adding too many additional supplementary materials, or leaving too much homework, which increases the burden of students' study. In the future, educational administrative departments at all levels must pay attention to supervising and inspecting schools' implementation of the State Council's decision to improve students' health. Schools should strengthen the idea of all-round development education, strictly implement the State Council's "Decision on Improving the Health of Students at All Levels of Schools," strengthen sports and cultural entertainment activities, improve environmental sanitation and food management, reduce students' excessive study burden, ensure that students have a regular life, and, according to the time stipulated by the government: attend classes during class time, exercise during exercise time, entertain during entertainment time, and sleep during sleep time. Only by paying attention to carrying out sports and health education can students' physical health be improved.

At present, the health of teachers is also not good. They are too busy and too tired. Therefore, it is necessary to improve work methods, overcome the phenomenon of being busy and chaotic, reduce the burden on teachers, appropriately reduce teachers' off-campus activities and meeting time, and ensure their rest time. In addition, providing care in life within the possible range is also very important.

III.

In recent years, there have been many excellent teachers who serve the people's education wholeheartedly and have excellent achievements. We should give them all kinds of due encouragement and rewards, and call on all teachers to learn from them. However, at present, there are still some people among the teachers whose political and ideological level, cultural level, and professional ability are not very commensurate with the task of cultivating "well-rounded members of socialist society." Therefore, improving teachers' political, cultural, and professional cultivation is a central link in implementing the policy of all-round development education, improving teaching work, and improving the quality of primary and secondary school education. Educational administrative leading organs at all levels should strengthen the leadership of teachers' on-the-job learning. Teachers' on-the-job learning should be planned for a long time, neither greedy for more and advancing rashly, nor sticking to old ways. It should be determined according to the different characteristics and needs of teachers, distinguishing between primary and secondary, and proceeding in a planned and step-by-step manner. Teachers with a graduate degree or above from normal colleges and specialized schools can focus on political theory learning, supplemented by professional learning. After completing the prescribed political theory subjects, they can turn to focus on educational science learning. Teachers who have not reached the graduation level of normal colleges and specialized schools should focus on reviewing the main courses of normal colleges and specialized schools, supplemented by learning current affairs policies. All localities should conscientiously run teacher training colleges, or entrust normal colleges to run correspondence departments, to absorb teachers who have not reached the graduation level of normal colleges and specialized schools to review. These are two important ways to improve teachers' cultural level, and they should be given great importance. In addition, forms such as the apprenticeship system, regular classes, and holiday intensive training can also be used to organize teachers to carry out political or professional learning. New teachers who have not undergone political study in the past should first study politics and conduct enlightenment education on political thought for them.

Professional learning is a regular learning. The current professional learning should be carried out in a planned way in conjunction with the study of new textbooks, and in conjunction with improving teaching work, the methods of "learning what you teach," "learning before teaching," "learning while teaching," and "supplementing what is lacking" should be implemented. The experience of some places has proved that this is an effective way to improve teachers' professional level.

To educate students with socialist thought, with the thought of Marxism-Leninism, this requires teachers to continue to carry out ideological transformation in depth, to arm themselves with Marxist-Leninist theory, socialist thought, advanced educational science, and national education policies, and use them to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois ideological viewpoints in their work, especially to correctly understand the relationship between physical labor and mental labor, and correct the exploitative class thought of despising physical labor and despising manual laborers.

Time must be guaranteed for organizing teachers' on-the-job learning. In principle, it can be stipulated as follows: (1) Political theory and education theory learning should not exceed four hours per week; (2) Cultural learning should not exceed six hours per week; (3) Professional learning can be carried out in conjunction with teaching research and lesson preparation.

At present, it is not easy to formulate a unified learning plan for primary and secondary school teachers nationwide. For the time being, each province and city will formulate a plan for teachers' on-the-job learning in each locality according to the specific local conditions. In terms of political theory learning, it is not advisable to advance on multiple fronts. Within a region or a school, the principle should be to study one course.

IV.

To run schools well and improve the quality of education, the first thing to do is to improve school leadership. The key to improving school leadership is to first establish the school's leadership core and give full play to the role of collective leadership. The principal is fully responsible for the work of the school, but must first strengthen the ideological and political leadership of classroom teaching, so that teaching work becomes the central task of the school. The principal must rely on teachers to do a good job in school work, and must first be good at uniting teachers, and then educating and improving teachers on the basis of unity. To achieve true unity among teachers, it is necessary to advocate that new and old teachers respect each other, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and make progress together. Therefore, the principal is required to conscientiously implement the Party's policy towards intellectuals. A comprehensive and correct assessment should be made of old teachers, and they should be good at discovering and developing their strengths, valuing their teaching experience, and should not despise and reject them. Their shortcomings and wrong ideas and behaviors should also be appropriately criticized to help them correct them. Indulgence alone is also not right. The training and improvement of a large number of young teachers is a serious task, and they should be organized to conduct amateur learning, review culture, and learn business. As for how to unite and educate teachers, the following issues should be paid attention to: 1. Strengthen the leadership of teaching groups and give full play to the expertise of teachers from teaching work. Further improve their ideological and political level, and through teaching research and teaching inspection, appropriately carry out criticism and self-criticism, help them strengthen socialist thought, establish a Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoints, and methods, and overcome bourgeois thoughts, viewpoints, and methods. 2. Help them improve from political study and business study. 3. Advocate that teachers set an example and influence students with exemplary actions. Make them improve their political awareness while carrying out political and ideological education for students. 4. Educate students to respect teachers, improve teachers' prestige, respect their self-esteem, and strengthen their sense of responsibility.

Finally, it must also be pointed out that the unity among school leaders is the key to uniting all teachers to do a good job in teaching. At present, there is still a phenomenon of disunity among some school leaders, which is not good and must be resolved quickly.

All educators, unite, study hard, improve teaching work, improve the quality of education, and strive to cultivate well-rounded members of socialist society.

    为培养社会主义社会全面发展的成员而努力
    中央人民政府教育部副部长　董纯才
    一
    “一定形态的政治和经济是首先决定那一定形态的文化的”（毛泽东：新民主主义论）。这是一条说明历史和现实的马克思主义真理。教育是在各个不同的社会经济形态之下，改变它的性质、目的、内容和方法的。因此，各个不同历史阶段的教育都有它的不同特点。教育性质是随着政治和经济的变化而变化的。
    中华人民共和国的成立，标志着中国革命第一阶段的基本结束和第二阶段的开始，即新民主主义革命阶段的基本结束和社会主义革命阶段的开始。中国革命第一阶段的任务是推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，建立新民主主义社会。第二阶段的任务是要在中国建立社会主义社会。
    在中国革命第一阶段，解放区施行的教育，是新民主主义教育。新民主主义教育是新民主主义革命运动的一个组成部分，是以新民主主义为内容，并为新民主主义革命服务的。这时，国民党统治区施行的是封建、买办、法西斯主义教育，这种教育是以封建、买办、法西斯主义为内容，并为封建、买办、法西斯主义服务的，是当时人民大众所反对的东西。
    中华人民共和国成立后，我国革命运动已开始转入社会主义革命阶段。我国的教育事业就成为工人阶级领导的国家建设事业的一个组成部分。它在过渡时期，是为实现总任务服务的，为建设社会主义社会服务的，是实现总任务的一个不可缺少的有力工具，是社会主义建设事业的一个组成部分。
    在中国革命第一阶段，我国社会的主要矛盾，是人民大众同帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的矛盾。这种矛盾反映到文化战线上来就是新民主主义的文化思想和封建、买办、法西斯主义的文化思想的矛盾。反对封建、买办、法西斯主义的文化思想就是当时新民主主义教育的主要任务。
    在中国革命第二阶段，国内的主要阶级矛盾，是工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾。这种阶级矛盾反映到思想战线上来就是社会主义的文化思想同资本主义的文化思想的矛盾。发展社会主义的文化思想，反对资本主义的文化思想，这就是社会主义教育的主要任务。在中华人民共和国成立的头几年，由于封建、买办、法西斯主义的思想在人们中间留下很深的影响，所以当时，还不能不集中力量来肃清这种反动思想毒素，以完成新民主主义革命未了的任务。现在，我们的学校教育就应积极发展社会主义的文化思想，彻底批判资本主义的文化思想，并进一步肃清封建、买办、法西斯主义思想残余。
    总起来说，在中国革命第一阶段，我国教育（主要是解放区教育）是以新民主主义为内容，并为新民主主义革命服务的。在中国革命第二阶段，我国教育，是以社会主义为内容，并为建设社会主义社会服务的。二
    中小学教育是普通教育；目前我国小学教育是国民义务教育性质；到一定时期，在一定条件下，中学教育也将成为义务教育。根据过渡时期国家建设的要求，国民受完义务教育，就应当去从事生产劳动，只有少数人升学深造。
    中小学教育的目的和任务是什么呢？中小学教育的目的和任务是培养社会主义社会全面发展的成员，即社会主义社会的自觉的积极的建设者和伟大祖国的保卫者。根据我国当前实际情况，中学教育不仅要供应高等学校以足够的合格的新生，并且还要供应国家生产建设以具有一定政治觉悟、文化教养和健康体质的新生力量。因此，中小学毕业生，除一部分人根据国家需要升学外，大部分人应该积极从事工农业生产劳动或其他建设工作。
    “培养社会主义社会全面发展的成员”，这一教育任务是根据什么提出的呢？它是根据我国过渡时期的总任务，根据建设社会主义社会的要求提出的。我国要建成一个伟大的社会主义国家，我们的学校教育就应当服务于这一伟大的总任务，担当起培养社会主义国家的建设者和保卫者的重任。社会主义社会的建设者，必须是个性全面发展的新人，这种新人应该是身心都得到健全的发展，具有社会主义的政治方向、辩证唯物论的世界观、共产主义的道德、一定的科学文化教养和健康的体质。这种新人应该遵行毛主席的指示，做到“身体好、学习好、工作好”。这种个性的全面发展，无论在奴隶制度下，在封建主义制度下，在资本主义制度下，都是不可能实现的。“民族压迫和封建压迫残酷地束缚着中国人民的个性发展”（毛泽东：论联合政府）。在阶级社会里，随着劳动分工，形成了体力劳动和脑力劳动的分离和对立。广大劳动人民从事粗重的体力劳动，他们受压迫和剥削，不可能受教育，缺乏文化教养，长期处于愚昧落后的状态。而少部分从事脑力劳动的人们，却不从事体力劳动，没有从事这种劳动的习惯和能力，他们学得一些书本知识，往往又不会应用。资产阶级学校就是“强迫学生去通晓一大堆无用的、累赘的、死板的知识，这种知识闭塞着青年的头脑，并把他们变成一些庸碌无能的官吏”（列宁：青年团底任务）。地主、资产阶级都是这样把一部分青年培养成为“四体不勤，五谷不分”的文弱书生和书呆子的。由此可见，在旧社会里，在剥削制度下，人的个性是不可能得到全面发展的。只有到了新社会，个性的全面发展才能开始实现；到了社会主义社会，消灭了剥削，消灭了阶级之间的对立，体力劳动和脑力劳动间的对立也消失之后，个性全面发展，才能进一步实现。这在苏联确是已经实现了，在我国也会随着资本主义和剥削制度的消灭而逐渐实现。至于消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动间的本质差别，那要到共产主义制度下，把全体工人阶级的文化技术都提高到工程师水平才能实现。现在我国正逐步地过渡到社会主义社会，我国儿童、青年面临的任务，是建设社会主义社会。为了实现这一任务，就要求我们的新后代的个性获得全面发展，身心都得到健全的发展，也就是说要求我们的新后代具有社会主义思想和一定的文化教养及健康的体质。因为只有这样全面发展的新人物才适宜担当建设社会主义社会的光荣、伟大的任务。因此，培养社会主义全面发展的成员，就成为我们中小学教育的重大的历史任务。
    要培养全面发展的新人，就必须施行全面发展的教育。中华人民共和国成立以后，我们虽提出过我们的学校要施行全面发展的教育，但是在贯彻执行这一方针中，还有些摇摆现象。有时偏到这方面，有时又偏到那方面。在解放战争时期和解放初期，我们的中学比较注重政治、思想教育，这是适合当时的客观形势的要求的，是必要的。当时的缺点，在于忽视文化科学知识的教育，这种偏向的形成，是和经验主义的思想有关联的。近年来中央提出学校教育应以教学为中心。有些学校执行中央这个指示时，又走到另一极端，只注意科学知识教学，不管政治思想教育，形成忽视政治的偏向。特别严重的是忽视了劳动教育，对旧社会轻视体力劳动和轻视工农劳动人民的剥削阶级思想，没有进行系统的、深刻的批判，这是一个原则性的错误，应该由我们负责。对学生身体健康，有很多学校一直是不很注意，以致当前学生健康状况很不好。这也是当前中、小学教育中的一个严重缺点。这种顾此失彼的做法，都是畸形发展的教育。我们必须努力纠正。
    从上述实际情况出发，当前在贯彻全面发展的教育方针中，要注意纠正上述偏向，加强政治思想教育，特别要加强劳动教育，改进教学工作，并改进体育卫生工作，使学生的身心获得全面的发展。这是提高中学教育质量的基本要求。
    （一）加强政治思想教育
    政治思想教育的任务，是要以社会主义的思想，马克思列宁主义的思想来教育学生，使他们建立社会主义的政治方向和辩证唯物论世界观的基础，并培养他们的共产主义道德。建立社会主义的政治方向，就是要使学生把建设社会主义社会和共产主义社会作为自己终生奋斗的目标。使他们明白今天的学习，就是为参加这一伟大建设事业作准备。培养学生辩证唯物论世界观的基础，就是要使他们在科学知识的基础上养成对自然现象和社会生活现象的唯物的观点，借以破除各种迷信观念和唯心观点。培养学生共产主义的道德，就是培养他们爱国主义思想，劳动观点，群众观点，爱护公共财物的精神，集体主义精神，自觉的纪律，以及坚韧，勇敢，谦逊，诚实，节俭，朴素等优良品质。为了完成上述政治思想教育的任务，必须以社会主义思想教育学生，同时还要批判资产阶级的思想，批判轻视体力劳动和劳动人民的思想，并继续肃清封建、买办、法西斯主义的思想残余。政治思想教育的三项任务是紧密联系不可分割的。社会主义的政治方向是建立在科学世界观的基础之上的。如果学生能够正确地了解社会发展的规律，那么他们就必然会树立起一个坚定不移的政治信念和政治方向——社会主义、共产主义的政治方向。另一方面，共产主义的道德也是要建立在科学的世界观的基础之上的。事实上，我们在进行政治思想教育时，这三方面也往往是交织在一起，不能孤立进行的。
    根据学生现存的思想情况，目前在中学进行政治思想教育，应特别着重加强爱国主义教育、劳动教育和自觉纪律教育。
    1、加强爱国主义教育。第一、要培养学生对祖国的热爱和献身于祖国社会主义建设事业的志向，准备随时为建设祖国、保卫祖国而辛勤劳动、牺牲奋斗。这就可以使爱国主义教育和社会主义的政治方向结合起来；同时也可以使爱国主义教育和劳动教育结合起来。第二、要加强学生的国家观念，使他们认识个人利益和国家利益的一致性，应使个人利益服从国家利益，要自觉地遵守社会秩序和国家法律，这样就可以使爱国主义和集体主义教育及自觉纪律教育结合起来。第三、要注意培养学生的民族自尊心、自信心和自豪感，同时也要培养国际主义精神，使他们对苏联、各人民民主国家及其他各国人民具有团结、友好、互助、合作的精神，要注意防止狭隘的民族主义思想和大国主义思想。这就使爱国主义思想和国际主义精神结合起来。
      2、加强劳动教育。必须在各级学校中加强经常的（不是突击的）和全面的（不是片面的）劳动教育。劳动教育的主要任务：第一、是培养学生具有社会主义的劳动观点，使他们认识劳动创造人类历史的真理，劳动是人类生活中第一个必需的条件，从而把劳动看作是光荣的事业，看作是对社会的首要职责，热爱劳动，尊重劳动人民；克服轻视体力劳动的和轻视工农的剥削阶级思想；第二、是要培养学生社会主义的劳动态度，自觉地遵守劳动纪律，以自觉的积极的态度对待劳动；第三、是培养学生的劳动习惯；第四、使学生获得工农业生产的基本知识和若干技能。在进行劳动教育时，第一、要注意和其他方面的政治思想教育（如爱国主义教育、集体主义教育等）紧密联系起来，孤立地进行劳动教育是收效不大的；第二、要注意把劳动教育当做经常的政治思想教育，单纯的把劳动教育看作是就业教育，或看作是对应届毕业生的临时突击任务都是不妥当的；第三、要注意把脑力劳动和体力劳动当成统一的相互联系的教育，应当把学习本身看作是一项主要劳动，通过各科教学，培养学生的劳动观点和勤劳习惯并取得工农业生产的基本知识和技能；同时也要适当地组织学生参加一些课外活动和力所能及的体力劳动。这样做的目的是使我们的学生手脑并用，使脑力劳动和体力劳动密切结合起来。那种把劳动教育单纯看作是体力劳动，认为“劳动教育就是干重活”的看法和作法，都是错误的。目前在许多学生中存在着轻视体力劳动和轻视劳动者的观点，及不少学校在进行劳动教育中所产生的一些偏向，都应当加以纠正。
    3．加强自觉的纪律教育。纪律教育的任务是培养学生学习的自觉性和积极性，自觉地遵守学校规则，维护学校秩序，尊敬教师，爱护学校财物，尊重集体利益，并培养遵守社会秩序和国家法律的思想。纪律教育的任务，还不单是为了保证教学过程得以顺利进行，更重要的是养成学生自觉地遵守纪律的习惯，为将来遵守劳动纪律和军队纪律作准备。因此，纪律教育应当和爱国主义教育、集体主义教育、劳动教育结合起来。目前有些学校存在着学生不尊重教师、不遵守学校纪律，不遵守社会秩序等不良现象，必须认真加以克服。
    进行政治思想教育的方法，主要通过课内各科教学和课外各种活动来进行。第一、要结合现实生活进行教育。过去我们曾结合革命斗争，结合各种社会改革运动，抗美援朝运动等对学生进行政治思想教育。这种教育，深入人心，收效很大。今后应吸取这种经验，结合社会主义的建设和社会主义的改造事业来进行政治思想教育，反对脱离现实生活的教育，反对闭门读书的偏向。第二、要结合学生生活和思想实际并根据青年特点，来有的放矢地进行教育，那种不顾学生思想实际的空洞说教的方法是会失败的。第三、政治思想教育的基本方法，就是毛主席所说的“民主的即说服的方法，而不是强迫的方法”。这是人民教育的一个优良传统，就是从正面以正确的思想观点来教育学生，使之认识真理，分清善恶，明辨是非，在行动上有所遵循。应注意发扬学生的优点，帮助他克服弱点。对学生的良好行为应予以表扬鼓励；对于学生的错误思想行为，既不能放任自流，也不能采用简单粗暴的方式来处理；必须是循循善诱，启发其觉悟，进行适当批评，帮助他们改正。对于那些实在说服无效的，可以采用适当的处罚手段，但是这也只是为了达到教育目的而不得已采用的一种补助方法，因此必须防止单纯惩罚的偏向。
    政治思想教育主要依靠教师来进行。教学是不能脱离政治思想的。教师们在教学中要注意政治思想教育，这是说，教师要注意教学中的思想性、政治性和科学性，而不是在教课中节外生枝，每课都加上一个政治尾巴，或把文化课当政治课教。因此，教学中既要反对忽视政治的倾向，又要反对教条主义。教师本人的言行对学生的思想意识具有潜移默化的功效，故教师对学生应注意以身作则。班主任对学生的政治思想教育负着很重要的责任，对于班主任的作用应加以重视。青年团、少先队是学校进行教育的不可缺少的得力助手。他们对于学生的政治思想教育，起着积极的作用。学校应善于取得团、队的帮助，来做好政治思想教育工作，团、队也应积极帮助学校工作。
      （二）改进教学工作
    教学是学校教育的中心环节，它的目的，是循序渐进地系统地以科学知识教给学生，同时在教学中贯彻政治思想教育。目前我们的学生的知识水平是很低的，思想还很不纯，我们要采取有效办法，以社会主义思想和系统的基本科学知识来武装学生，提高他们的知识水平和思想觉悟。为此，必须改进我们的教学工作。
    过去几年我们曾进行了初步教学改革。我们的教学改革，是以老解放区的经验做基础，并注意学习苏联教育的先进理论和先进经验。早在抗日战争时期，毛主席就已指示：“改订学制，废除不急需与不必要的课程，改变管理制度，以教授战争所必需之课程及发扬学生的学习积极性为原则。”根据毛主席的指示，老解放区的中小学，首先废除了旧中国中小学的一套社会科学教本，代之以新民主主义为内容的新编的教本。在自然科学方面，选用思想毒素较少的旧课本，或加以改编。在教学方法上，开始注意联系实际。新中国成立后，除了老解放区的中小学外，我们接收了大批旧学校。我们根据老解放区的经验，也是先废除旧的文史课本，代之以新课本（以老解放区的课本为蓝本改编的）。跟着就学习苏联的先进经验，制订中小学教学计划，并以苏联中学用的教学大纲和教科书作为蓝本，编订教学大纲和改编教科书。现在用的自然科学教本是以苏联的课本作蓝本，社会科学教本则是以老解放区的课本作基础。在改革教学内容的同时，很多学校就动手学习苏联的先进经验，改革教学方法。
    我们中小学的教学工作，虽然经过了一番改革，但还不彻底。今后要进一步加以改进，以求提高中小学教育的质量。根据老解放区的经验和苏联的先进经验，目前改进中小学教学工作，应当注意以下问题：　　第一、教学必须贯彻理论和实际相结合的原则。一要使教学和政治斗争结合起来，并为政治斗争服务；二要使教学和生产建设结合起来，并为生产建设服务。列宁说过，“如果不把青年一代的教育和生产劳动结合起来，未来社会的理想是不能想像的。没有生产劳动而谈教育和教学，没有相应的教育和教学而谈生产劳动，都不能被提到现代技术水平和科学知识情况所要求的那样的高度”。过去老解放区的中小学教育比较注意这条原则。近年来有些学校的教学工作，有脱离生产劳动和忽视政治的倾向。这是应当注意改正的。
    第二、教学改革应以教学内容的改革为中心，相应地改革教学方法。只在教学方法的改革上打圈子，忽视教学内容的改革，这是本末倒置。当然教学内容改革了，教学方法不改革也不行，否则就不能很好地完成教学任务。
    关于教学内容的改革，首先要求教师钻研新教材，领会每课的教学目的，抓住它的中心思想和中心内容，按照教学目的，把教材的思想内容和科学内容正确地系统地传授给学生。我们要求教师们逐步学会运用辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的观点来讲课，要求教师把科学知识正确地传授给学生，并在课堂教学中注意贯彻政治思想教育。这就要求教师适当地搜集、采用国家建设的实际材料来充实教学内容，并创造条件，制造教具，进行直观教学，使学生能作实验和参观，以巩固和练习运用所学知识。
    改进教学的一项最基本的工作是编印一套完善的教学大纲和教科书及教学指导书。中央教育部已准备根据国家过渡时期的总任务和中小学教育的目的，进一步以辩证唯物和历史唯物的观点和方法，按照社会主义的教育原则，并结合中国实际，改编中小学教学大纲和教科书，并准备为教师编一套教学指导书。我们计划在第一个五年计划期内，完成这一思想建设工程。当前有些课本的分量太重，这是形成学生功课负担过重的主要原因，中央教育部已订出精简方案，供各校参考。首先将高中三年级的物理学和历史两科教材予以精简。初中外国语课已决定取消。其余课目教材的精简问题，我们还要加以研究，再作决定。
    第三、要注意克服教条主义和形式主义。教条主义和形式主义，都是旧中国旧教育的遗毒。在旧式学校里，教学就是脱离实际，就是教学生读死书。这种根深蒂固的毛病，至今有些学校还没有完全克服。因此，在学习苏联，改革教学过程中，就产生脱离中国实际，机械地搬用苏联经验的偏向。首先是我们中学的教学计划，还有不切合实际的毛病。其次，有些学校学习苏联的经验，比较偏重于教学方法的改革，甚至一味在改革教学方法上打圈子，忽视对教材的钻研。这些都是教条主义和形式主义的反映，今后在教学改革中，必须加以纠正。但须指出，我们中央教育部以往对学校的教学改革，既缺乏明确的思想领导，又没有经常的具体指导。因此，学校里产生教条主义和形式主义的毛病，是和我们的官僚主义领导作风有联系的。这是我们应该检讨的。
    第四、教师的思想改造是教学改革的必要前提。而教师通过教学改革，又可以改造和提高思想，特别是教育思想和学术思想。因此，今后应结合改进教学工作继续对教师进行思想改造。
    （三）注意健康教育
    注意健康教育，增强学生的体质，这是全面发展教育不可分割的内容之一。中国共产党中央和毛主席对学生的健康状况极为关怀。中央人民政府政务院早在一九五一年就作了“关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定”。这几年来，对改进学生健康状况虽作了一些工作，学生的健康也有若干改善，但作得还是非常不够，学生健康状况仍然不够好。这说明对政务院改善学生健康状况的决定的执行是很差的。其原因是我们教育行政部门还有主观主义和官僚主义。主观主义主要表现在我们有些教科书的分量太重，加重了学生学习的负担。官僚主义表现在我们对执行政务院的决定，缺乏督促检查。在学校行政方面，对学生的健康也注意不够，对全面发展的教育思想还不明确。在教师方面，也有不顾学生接受能力，额外增加过多的补充教材，或留过多的作业，加重了学生学习负担的现象。今后各级教育行政部门必须注意督促检查学校执行政务院关于改善学生健康状况的决定。学校方面，应加强全面发展的教育思想，严格执行政务院“关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定”，加强体育和文化娱乐活动，改善环境卫生和伙食管理，减轻学生过重的学习负担，保证学生过有规律的生活，按照政府规定的时间：上课的时间上课，运动的时间运动，娱乐的时间娱乐，睡眠的时间睡眠。只有经常注意进行体育卫生教育，才能增进学生的身体健康。
    目前教师的健康状况也不好，他们太忙太累。因此要改进工作方法，克服忙乱现象，减轻教师负担，适当减少教师的校外活动和开会时间，保证他们的休息时间。另外在生活上予以可能范围内的照顾，也是很重要的。三
    几年来有不少优秀教师，他们全心全意为人民教育服务，有优良的成绩，我们应给他们各种应有的鼓舞和奖励，并号召全体教师，向他们学习。但目前教师中也还有些人的政治思想水平，文化水平，业务能力，和他们担当培养“社会主义社会全面发展的成员”的任务是不很相称的。因此提高教师的政治、文化和业务修养，是贯彻全面发展教育的方针，改进教学工作，提高中小学教育质量的一个中心环节。各级教育行政领导机关，应加强对在职教师学习的领导。教师的在职学习应当作长期打算，既不要贪多冒进，也不要故步自封。应当根据教师的不同特点和需要，确定主次，分清缓急，有计划有步骤地进行。师范专科学校以上毕业程度的教师，可以政治理论学习为主，以业务学习为辅。学完了规定的政治理论科目之后，可以转而以教育科学学习为主。未达到师范专科学校毕业水平的教师，应以补习师范专科学校的主要课业为主，以学习时事政策为辅。各地应认真办好教师进修学院，或委托师范学院办函授部，吸收未达到师范专科学校毕业程度的教师补习。这是提高教师文化水平的两个重要办法，应当十分重视。另外，还可以采用传授制，定期上课，假期集训等形式，组织教师进行政治或业务学习。过去没有进行过政治学习的新教师，应先学习政治，对他们进行政治思想的启蒙教育。
    业务学习是一种经常的学习。当前的业务学习，应结合研究新教材来有计划地进行，结合改进教学工作，实行“教什么学什么”、“先学后教”、“边学边教”、“缺什么补什么”等方法。有些地方的经验证明，这是提高教师业务水平的一个有效办法。
    要以社会主义思想、马克思列宁主义思想教育学生，这就要求教师要继续深入进行思想改造，要以马克思列宁主义理论，社会主义思想，先进教育科学和国家教育政策来武装自己，并用以彻底批判自己工作中的资产阶级的思想观点，特别应当正确认识体力劳动和脑力劳动的关系，纠正轻视体力劳动，轻视工农体力劳动者的剥削阶级思想。
    组织教师在职学习，必须予以时间上的保证。原则上可以这样规定：（一）政治理论和教育理论学习，每周不超过四小时；（二）文化学习，每周不超过六小时；（三）业务学习，可结合教学研究和备课进行。
    目前一时还不容易拟订一个全国中小学教师的统一学习计划，暂时还是由各省、市根据当地具体情况，制订各地教师的在职学习计划。在政治理论学习方面，不宜多头并进，在一个地区或一个学校之内，应以学习一门课为原则。四
    要办好学校，提高教育质量，必须首先改进学校领导工作。改进学校领导的关键，首先应该建立学校领导核心，发挥集体领导作用。校长对学校工作全面负责，但必须首先加强课堂教学的思想政治领导，使教学工作成为学校的中心任务。校长要依靠教师做好学校工作，必须首先善于把教师团结好，在团结的基础上来教育提高教师。要达到教师间的真正团结，必须提倡新老教师互相尊重，互相学习，取长补短，共同进步。因此，要求校长能认真贯彻执行党对知识分子的政策。对老教师应有全面正确的估计，要善于发现和发挥他们的长处，重视他们的教学经验，不应轻视和排斥他们。对于他们的缺点和错误思想行为，也要适当地予以批评，帮助他们改正，一味迁就也是不对的。对大批青年教师的培养提高则是一个严重的任务，应组织他们进行业余学习，补习文化，学习业务。至于如何团结和教育教师，应注意以下几个问题：1．加强教学小组的领导，从教学工作中发挥教师的特长。进一步提高他们的思想政治水平，通过教学研究和教学检查，适当开展批评和自我批评，帮助他们加强社会主义思想，树立马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，克服资产阶级的思想、观点和方法。2．从政治学习和业务学习中帮助他们提高。3．提倡教师以身作则，以模范行动影响学生。使他们在对学生进行政治思想教育当中，同时提高自己的政治觉悟。4．教育学生尊敬老师，提高教师威信，尊重其自尊心，加强其责任心。
    最后还必须指出，学校领导干部间的团结，是团结全体教师做好教学工作的关键。目前有的学校领导干部间还有不团结的现象，这是不好的，必须很快解决。
    全体教育工作者团结起来，努力学习，改进教导工作，提高教育质量，为培养社会主义社会全面发展的成员而努力。
