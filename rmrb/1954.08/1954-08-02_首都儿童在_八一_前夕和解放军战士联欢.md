On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, more than 800 Young Pioneers and children from more than ten elementary schools in the capital gathered at the "Children's Home" in Beihai Park, Beijing, along with more than 80 "uncles" from the land, sea, and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They held a joyous gathering here.

The little chairman of the party was Feng Lijin, a Young Pioneer from Beijing's Peiyuan Elementary School. She said excitedly: When celebrating "August 1st" Army Day, we must learn from the spirit of the PLA "uncles" who bravely fought for the motherland despite difficulties. In the future, we will be like the PLA "uncles" to defend and build our motherland. The children expressed their sincere gratitude and welcome to the PLA "uncles" present with warm applause. Then, Shi Renqing from the Zhan You (Comrades-in-Arms) Society of the Political Department of the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was invited to talk about the significance of the "August 1st" Army Day.

During group activities, the children held hands with the PLA "uncles," some in the courtyard of the "Children's Home" and some running to the lakeside of Beihai Park, having fun to their heart's content. In the Five Dragon Pavilions, more than ten Young Pioneers from the Xisi District Central Elementary School quietly listened to Air Force "Uncle" Xie Zhongxin explain how airplanes fly and the stories of aerial combat. When Xie Zhongxin spoke about who invented the airplane the earliest in the world, Li Shizhu, an eleven-year-old student sitting beside him, immediately rushed to say: "It's the Russian Mozhaisky!" This clever answer was immediately praised by the Air Force "Uncle." Among the many groups of children, Ha Ling, a Young Pioneer from Peiyuan Elementary School, told the Navy "uncles" about their happy team day activities during the summer vacation, and the Navy "uncles" told them about the life of the Navy. Some children also reported on their studies to the PLA "uncles" with great interest. The children danced group dances with the PLA "uncles." Clear and hearty laughter and singing were constantly heard from the lakeside and the small pine forest.

In the artistic performances, both the children and the PLA "uncles" performed many beautiful programs. Young Pioneer Zhu Tongsheng also recited the poem written by the children that day: "Dedicated to You - Dear Uncles." He recited these exciting lines: "We promise you, we will always remember that happiness is the crystallization of the uncles' blood; we will never let our uncles down, we must prepare everything for the construction of the socialist motherland!"

    首都儿童在“八一”前夕和解放军战士联欢
    “八一”建军节前夕，在北京北海公园的“少年之家”里，聚集着来自十多个小学校的八百多名少年先锋队队员、儿童和八十多名中国人民解放军陆、海、空军“叔叔”，他们在这里举行快乐的聚会。
    联欢会的小主席是北京市培元小学的少年先锋队队员冯丽禁，她兴奋地说：在庆祝“八一”建军节的时候，我们要学习解放军“叔叔”为了祖国不怕困难英勇奋斗的精神，我们将来要像解放军“叔叔”一样地保卫祖国，建设祖国。孩子们以热烈的掌声向到会的解放军“叔叔”表示真诚的感谢和欢迎。接着，邀请了中国人民解放军华北军区政治部战友社的史仁青讲“八一”建军节的意义。
    在分组活动中，一个个的孩子和解放军“叔叔”拉着手，有的在“少年之家”的院子里，有的跑到北海公园湖滨，在尽情地游玩。在五龙亭里，西四区中心小学十多名少年先锋队队员静静地听空军“叔叔”谢忠信讲解飞机怎样会飞和空战的故事。当谢忠信说到世界上最早发明飞机的是谁的时候，在他身旁坐着一个十一岁的小学生李世铸马上抢着说：“是俄国莫查伊斯基！”这个聪明的回答马上受到空军“叔叔”的赞扬。在许多群孩子中，培元小学少年先锋队员哈玲向海军“叔叔”们讲他们在暑期中快乐的队日活动，海军“叔叔”就向他们讲海军的生活。有的孩子还向解放军“叔叔”津津有味地报告了学习情况。孩子们和解放军“叔叔”在一起跳着集体舞。从湖边和小松林里不时传来清脆爽朗的欢笑和歌声。
    在文艺表演中，孩子们和解放军“叔叔”都表演了许多优美的节目。少年先锋队员朱通生还朗诵了孩子们当天赶写出的诗篇：“献给你——亲爱的叔叔”。他激动地朗诵出这样的诗句： “向你保证，永远记住幸福是叔叔鲜血的结晶；我们决不辜负叔叔，我们要为社会主义祖国的建设准备一切！”　（新华社）
