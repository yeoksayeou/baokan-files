    Strive to Overfulfill the Agricultural Production Increase Plan
    Farmers in Various Regions Vigorously Increase Planting of Late Autumn Crops
    Sichuan Farmers Actively Increase Planting of a Second Season of Crops
    Farmers in various parts of Sichuan Province are actively increasing the planting of a second season of crops, striving to overfulfill the agricultural production increase plan. The Tongliang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has set a plan to increase production by an additional two percent on the basis of the original seven percent increase. The county is required to cultivate ratooning rice on more than 47,000 mu of paddy fields, estimated to yield 4.73 million jin of rice; and to increase the planting of more than 33,000 mu of autumn corn, autumn sweet potatoes, buckwheat, radishes, etc., according to local conditions, estimated to yield 3.28 million jin of grain. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places are taking the lead in responding to the call of the county committee. The seven agricultural production cooperatives in Dongguo Township decided to cultivate ratooning rice on 20 to 30 percent of their paddy fields; the Mingyue Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiuyuan Township has already started planting radishes, driving the surrounding mutual aid teams to take action as well. Two agricultural production cooperatives in Shuikou Village, Longmen Township, Jiangjin County, planted nine mu of corn, three mu of buckwheat, and seventy mu of ratooning rice; the Huang Kejun mutual aid team also planted ten mu of autumn corn in one day, and the entire township overfulfilled the sowing plan for late autumn crops in four days. The ratooning rice has now been weeded once, and the township plans to accumulate another five million jin of fertilizer. Junping Township, Chongning County, combined the establishment of cooperatives with the preparation for the autumn harvest, widely publicizing the benefits of increasing the planting of a second season of crops. During a discussion in the Zhang Shuwu joint group in Tongzi Village, group leader Huang Qinghai said: "Our farmer brothers in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have suffered from floods, so we should definitely give them our strong support. That's what mutual aid and cooperation is all about! Besides, planting an extra season can also increase our income." He originally only planned to plant two fen of potatoes, but now he has expanded it to six fen. The entire group is rushing to plant more than 43 mu of short-term crops. The Tian'e joint group in Wanshou Village also decided to plant 71.7 mu of late autumn crops.
    Jiangsu Farmers Rush to Plant Late Autumn Crops
    The floodwater has been drained from most of the flooded farmland in Jiangsu Province. All localities have concentrated manpower and resources to carry out a crash drainage campaign, and the work is progressing rapidly. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have been used as the backbone in the drainage work, driving the masses and improving the efficiency of flood drainage. People from non-disaster areas have also been organized to assist in flood drainage in disaster areas, greatly strengthening the drainage force. Wujin County supported Yangzhou County with 92 water pumps, allowing the farmland in Yangzhou County to be drained earlier. The masses in the highland areas of Jianhu County were organized to help drain water from the low-lying areas, and some even brought their own waterwheels to help. All localities have carried out timely replanting and alternate planting of the drained farmland. The four special districts of Huaiyin, Yancheng, Xuzhou, and Yangzhou have recently replanted and supplemented planting on 2.2 million mu.
    While draining water, many areas have paid attention to mobilizing the masses to carry out production for self-relief. In a few low-lying areas where floodwater cannot be drained temporarily, the masses have been mobilized to sow vegetables in the un-submerged areas around their houses and in the courtyards, and to actively carry out sideline production to increase income.
    Hebei Farmers Raise Ridges and Rush to Plant
    Farmers in the flood-stricken areas of Hebei Province are actively draining water and rushing to plant late autumn crops. Farmers in the flood-stricken areas of Jinghai County have been building dikes and diverting water in the flooded farmland, raising ridges and rushing to plant. In some farmlands where the mud is too thick to plant, farmers first use rakes to break the surface of the soil and dry it in the sun; if the ground is too soft to use a drill, farmers use plows or sow seeds by hand to save time and plant in time. Farmers in the flooded areas of Baoding Special District have also created a method of mixing chaff with seeds to increase soil temperature and promote early emergence. In addition to timely draining water and rushing to plant late-maturing fields, farmers in the flooded areas of Tianjin Special District are also rushing to plant more than 80,000 mu of buckwheat, sweet potatoes, and late vegetables in the corners of fields and courtyards to make up for the losses in the fields. In order not to miss the planting season, farmers in some flood-stricken areas are also actively cultivating vegetable seedlings in preparation for transplanting after the water is drained. Twelve agricultural production cooperatives in Fangshang and other villages in Mancheng County alone have cultivated 106 mu of cabbage and turnip seedlings, enough to plant more than 500 mu of land.
    Yunnan Farmers Transplant a Second Crop of Seedlings
    Yunnan Province expects a bumper harvest of food crops such as rice, corn, buckwheat, and soybeans, as well as cash crops such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, peanuts, and sugarcane. The early corn and early buckwheat in Simao, Wenshan, Mengzi, Lincang, and other special districts have begun to be harvested or are about to be harvested, and yields are generally expected to increase by 10 to 15 percent. Peanuts are being harvested one after another in Mengzi, Chuxiong, and other special districts, with an estimated increase of 10 to 20 percent.
    Currently, mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various places are actively leading the masses of farmers in weeding, pest control, and applying topdressing fertilizer. Cotton has generally been cultivated and weeded three times, and farmers in Baoshan, Dali, and other special districts have weeded cotton four to five times and carried out topping and pruning. Rice has generally been weeded for the first time, and some areas in Zhaotong, Lijiang, Wenshan, Lincang, and other special districts are carrying out the second weeding and applying topdressing fertilizer. Farmers in Yuanmou, Yuanyang, Yuanjiang, Eshan, Xinping, and other counties are busily transplanting a second crop of seedlings after harvesting the early rice, striving to increase grain production even further.
    Farmers in the Suburbs of Wuhan Rush to Plant Vegetables
    Farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan are plowing the land, transporting manure, and rushing to plant vegetables day and night. At present, nearly 8,000 mu of vegetables have been planted in the suburbs of the city. Tender green vegetable seedlings have now grown on many plots of land that were previously flooded. A few early-sown Chinese cabbage has already matured. Most of the Chinese cabbage, snow cabbage, and other green vegetables will be on the market soon.
    Since the beginning of August, the weather in Wuhan has been mostly sunny. The pumps supported by all parts of the country continue to drain the floodwaters, and many farmers have also organized themselves to pump water. The floodwaters in the suburbs have gradually receded. As the floodwaters receded, the people's government strongly led the rush to plant vegetables. Many farmers in Huiji District, under the slogan of "competing with floodwater for land," are busy cultivating the land and sowing seeds day and night. Many women and children in Nanhu District have also organized themselves to help with weeding.

    争取超额完成农业增产计划
    各地农民大力增种晚秋作物
    四川农民纷纷增种一季作物
    四川省各地农民纷纷增种一季作物，争取超额完成农业增产计划。中共铜梁县委会订出了在原增产百分之七的基础上再增产百分之二的计划。要求全县以四万七千多亩水田培育再生稻，估计可收稻谷四百七十三万斤；再因地制宜地增种三万三千多亩秋苞谷、秋红苕、荞子、萝卜等，估计可收粮食三百二十八万斤。各地农业生产合作社和互助组带头响应县委的号召，东郭乡七个农业生产合作社决定以百分之二十至三十的水田培植再生稻；久远乡明月农业生产合作社已开始种萝卜，带动周围互助组也行动起来。江津县龙门乡水口村两个农业生产合作社种了九亩苞谷、三亩荞子和七十亩再生稻；黄克君互助组在一天内也种了十亩秋苞谷，全乡在四天内就超额完成了晚秋作物的播种计划。现在再生稻已薅淋了一次，全乡计划再积肥五百万斤。崇宁县君平乡结合建社和秋收准备工作，广泛宣传增种一季作物的好处。桐子村张书武联组讨论时，小组长黄清海说：“长江中下游的农民弟兄遭了水灾，我们当然应该大力支援，这才叫做团结互助！何况多种一季自己也能增加收入。”他本来只准备种两分田的洋芋，现在已扩大到六分了。全组抢种四十三亩多的短期作物。万寿村天鹅联组也决定栽种七十一亩七分田的晚秋作物。
    江苏农民抢种晚秋作物
    江苏省受涝的绝大部分农田已排出积水。各地都集中了人力物力突击排水，工作进展迅速。各地在排水时都把农业生产合作社、互助组作为骨干，带动广大群众，提高了排涝效率。非灾区群众组织起来到灾区协助排水，也大大加强了排水力量。武进县支援扬中县戽水机九十二部，使扬中县农田积水得以早日排出。建湖县高田地区群众组织起来，帮助低田地区排水，有的还自带水车前往帮助。各地对排出的农田都及时进行了抢种、改种。淮阴、盐城、徐州、扬州四个专区最近已改种、补种了二百二十万亩。
    在排水同时，许多地区都注意发动群众开展生产自救。少数低洼地区暂时无法排出积水的，已发动群众在未淹没的宅基前后和场地上播种蔬菜，并积极开展副业生产，以增加收入。
    河北农民起埂抢种
    河北省受涝地区农民积极排水抢种晚秋作物。静海县受涝地区农民，曾在被涝的耕地里挡埝掏水，起埂抢种。有些耕地泥泞不能种，农民们便先用挠钩划破地皮晒地；地软不能下耧，农民们就用犁钩犁种或用手撒籽，争取时间，及时下种。保定专区受涝地区的农民还创造掺糠下种的办法，增高地温，促使早出苗。天津专区受涝地区的农民，除及时排出积水抢种晚田外，并在地头场角隙地上抢种八万多亩荞麦、甘薯和晚菜，弥补田间的损失。为不失时机播种，部分受涝地区农民还积极培育菜苗，准备排水后移栽。仅满城县房上等村十二个农业生产合作社，就培育好白菜、萝?苗一百零六亩，够供五百多亩地栽用。
    云南农民栽第二次秧
    云南省水稻、玉米、荞麦、大豆等粮食作物及棉花、烤烟、花生、甘蔗等作物可望丰收。思茅、文山、蒙自、临沧等专区的早玉米、早荞麦已开始收获或将收获完毕，一般可增产百分之十至十五。蒙自、楚雄等专区的花生正陆续收获中，约可增产一成到两成。
    目前各地互助合作组织，正积极带动农民群众锄草、除虫和施追肥，棉花的中耕除草一般达三次，保山、大理等专区农民棉花除草达四次到五次，并进行了摘心整枝工作。水稻已普遍薅完第一次秧，昭通、丽江、文山、临沧等专区部分地区正进行薅第二次秧和施追肥。元谋、元阳、元江、峨山、新平等县农民在收完早稻后，又紧张地进行栽第二次秧，争取增产更多的粮食。
    武汉市郊农民抢种蔬菜
    武汉市郊区农民正不分日夜地犁地、运粪、抢种蔬菜。目前，全市郊区已种上近八千亩蔬菜。许多原来是一片积水的土地上，现在已长出嫩绿的菜苗了。个别播种较早的小白菜已经成熟。大部分小白菜、雪里红等青菜即将陆续上市。
    武汉市自八月上旬以来，天气大多晴朗，全国各地支援武汉的抽水机继续排除积水，许多农民也组织起来车水，郊区积水已渐渐退落。随着积水的退落，人民政府即大力领导抢种蔬菜。惠济区很多农民，在“和积水争地”的口号下，夜以继日地忙着耕地、下种。南湖区许多妇女、儿童也组织起来帮助除草。
