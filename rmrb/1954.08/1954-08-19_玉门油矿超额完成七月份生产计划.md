Yumen Mining Bureau comprehensively overfulfilled its production plan for July this year. The total industrial output value completed 104.4 percent of the plan, and the various major products—crude oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, lubricating oil, etc.—completed at least 101.4 percent of the plan, and at most 108.1 percent of the plan.

The bureau's production level from January to July this year has greatly exceeded the production level of the same period last year. The total industrial output value exceeded the same period last year by 24.2 percent, and the various major products exceeded by at least 4.9 percent and at most 103.4 percent.

In order to complete and overfulfill the July production plan, all the mine's employees have taken a series of methods and measures: for example, the workover team of the oil production department implemented the Soviet expert's suggestion and greatly shortened the soaking time of mud in the well, thereby completing the well workover task ahead of schedule.

In July, the refinery administration and all employees also signed a collective contract for the second half of the year, striving to increase the production of gasoline by 5,000 tons and kerosene by 1,500 tons in the second half of the year, in order to further meet the growing needs of major cities and rural areas across the country.

    玉门油矿超额完成七月份生产计划
    玉门矿务局全面地超额完成了今年七月份的生产计划。计工业总产值完成计划的百分之一○四点四，各项主要产品——原油、汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油等最少的完成了计划的百分之一○一点四；最多的完成了计划的百分之一○八点一。
    该局今年一至七月份的生产水平已大大超过了去年同期的生产水平，工业总产值超过了去年同期百分之二十四点二，各项主要产品最少的超过了百分之四点九；最多的超过了百分之一○三点四。
    为了完成和超额完成七月份的生产计划、全矿职工曾经采取了一连串的办法和措施：例如采油处修井队执行了苏联专家建议、大大缩短了泥浆在井内的泡浸时间，因而提前完成了修井任务。
    炼油厂行政与全体职工在七月份还签订了下半年的集体合同，争取要在下半年内增产汽油五千吨、煤油一千五百吨，以进一步适应全国各大城市和乡村日益增长的需要。
