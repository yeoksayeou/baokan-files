The statement was jointly signed by the chairman of the committee, Tekin Kodoma, and prominent figures from all walks of life in Burma.
    The statement first pointed out: The realization of the armistice in Indochina is a new victory for peace-loving people all over the world.
    The statement then pointed out that a small group of warmongers have not stopped their activities to undermine peace, and are even more busy organizing the Southeast Asia war bloc...are stepping up the arming of some Asian countries such as Thailand and Pakistan, and establishing war bases, attempting to provoke and incite war between Asian countries. The statement said: These conspiracies of the warmongers "are to undermine peace in Asia and to reignite the flames of war in Asia."
    The statement called for striving to the end for the establishment of a joint security system for Asian countries, to avoid wars between Asian countries and Asian people, to oppose the Southeast Asia war bloc planned by the warmongers, and to completely prohibit the use of weapons such as atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs.
