Xinhua News Agency, August 16th: U.S. military personnel have recently been continuously arriving in Taiwan, stepping up their activities of aggression.

U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Partridge and U.S. Japan Air Defense Commander Roy Lynn visited Taiwan from the 14th to the 16th for three days of activities. Partridge and others listened to reports on the situation in Taiwan, inspected Chiang Kai-shek bandit air bases, and discussed with Chiang Kai-shek and the Chiang bandit air force authorities the issue of the U.S. expanding the Chiang bandit air force. Partridge and others returned to Tokyo on the 16th.

A 14-member delegation led by U.S. Army Intelligence Chief Trudeau, after activities in the Philippines and Hong Kong, plans to go to Taiwan on the 16th to conduct activities. It is revealed that this delegation will hold consultations with the U.S. military aid advisory group stationed in Taiwan and the Chiang bandit military authorities to discuss the issue of diverting U.S. military supplies originally intended for Indochina to Taiwan for delivery to the Chiang bandits.

U.S. First Fleet Commander Phillips, who recently directed armed provocations against our country along the coast of Hainan Island, will also lead two aircraft carriers to Taiwan this week. According to foreign news agencies, after Phillips arrives in Taiwan, the U.S. and Chiang will hold a "high-level military conference" to plot to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. It is said that the U.S. side participating in the meeting will include U.S. First Fleet Commander Phillips, U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Pride, U.S. Seventy-Second Task Force Commander Kivette, who illegally controls the Taiwan Strait, and Chase, head of the U.S. military aid advisory group stationed in Taiwan.

There are also reports that U.S. Ambassador to the Chiang bandits, Rankin, will return to Taiwan from the United States around the 20th of this month. It is said that Rankin will bring instructions from the U.S. government from Washington and intensify negotiations with the Chiang bandits to conclude a U.S.-Chiang "joint defense treaty."
