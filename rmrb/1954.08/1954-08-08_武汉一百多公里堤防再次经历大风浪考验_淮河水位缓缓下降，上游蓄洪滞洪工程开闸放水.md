Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th: Wuhan City's over one hundred kilometers of levee lines have once again victoriously withstood the test of wind and waves. At 6:00 PM on the 6th, the Yangtze River water level at the Wuhan Customs reached 29.21 meters, 0.93 meters higher than the historical high water level. At 3:00 AM on the 6th, Wuhan City was hit by a level 6 southeasterly wind, and the strong wind stirred up huge waves, impacting Wuhan City's levee line. However, the wind quickly subsided, and the city's levees stood firm. From morning to afternoon on the 6th, Wuhan City still experienced level 3 to level 4 southeasterly winds, with occasional level 5 winds in individual areas. The wave-breaking willow branches and other wave-breaking equipment that had been hung along the levee beforehand played a significant role. No major incidents occurred on the city's levees.

The 1.5 million people of Wuhan City are doing everything possible to support the 100,000-strong flood control army in accelerating the completion of the fourth phase of levee reinforcement and heightening project. Many women and children in various streets of the city are automatically collecting scattered stones and bricks from their homes, piling them up in large piles along the streets, and transporting them to the levee front lines. Many youth shock brigades from schools and government offices are participating in large numbers in the levee reinforcement and heightening work in the fourth phase of the project. Many people among the masses consider it an honor to be able to contribute to the current fight against the flood and protect the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 7th: By the end of July, the Hong River and Ru River areas in the upper reaches of the Huai River had basically stopped raining. The water levels of the main stream of the Huai River and its tributaries such as the Hong River and Ru River began to slowly recede. The outlet gates of reservoirs and low-lying flood storage and other projects were slowly opened, and water was safely discharged downstream according to the flood discharge capacity of the downstream river channels. By August 2nd, the Bo Mountain Reservoir, Shi Man Tan Reservoir, Ban Qiao Reservoir, and Jiao Ting Lake low-lying flood storage projects had basically released the stored floodwater, emptying their bellies. Other flood storage and detention projects have also discharged a considerable amount of floodwater, preparing favorable conditions for flood control in August.

    武汉一百多公里堤防再次经历大风浪考验
    淮河水位缓缓下降，上游蓄洪滞洪工程开闸放水
    【新华社武汉七日电】武汉市一百多公里的堤防线又一次胜利地经历了大风浪的考验。六日下午六时，武汉关长江水位已达二九点二一公尺，比历史最高水位高出零点九三公尺。六日晨三时，武汉市遭到六级东南风袭击，大风卷起巨浪，冲击着武汉市堤防线。但风势迅即转缓，全市堤防屹立未动。六日上午到下午，武汉市仍有三级到四级的东南风，个别地方有时仍达五级风。沿堤事前挂上的防浪柳枝和其他防浪设备都发挥很大作用。全市堤防没有发生重大险情。
    武汉市一百五十万人民，正尽一切力量支援十万防汛大军加速完成第四期堤防加固加高的工程。全市各街道许多妇女和儿童正自动把家里的零碎石块砖头，沿街一大堆一大堆地集中起来，输送给堤防前线。许多学校和机关的青年突击队正大批地参加第四期工程中堤防加固加高工作。群众中许许多多人都以自己能为当前战胜洪水出一分力量保卫这个城市为光荣。
    据新华社开封七日电：七月底，淮河上游洪河、汝河一带已基本上停雨了。淮河干流和洪河、汝河等支流的水位开始缓缓下降，水库和洼地蓄洪等工程的出水闸门徐徐张开，根据下游河道的排洪能力，安全向下泄洪。到八月二日止，薄山水库、石漫滩水库、板桥水库和蛟停湖洼地蓄洪工程，基本上已把拦蓄的洪水放出，腾空了肚腹。其他蓄洪、滞洪工程也下泄了不少洪水，为八月防洪准备好有利条件。
