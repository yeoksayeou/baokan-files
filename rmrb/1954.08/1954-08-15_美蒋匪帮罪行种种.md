    Various Crimes of the American-Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang
        Espionage
    The American Ambassador to Thailand, Donovan, paid a three-day "unofficial visit" to Taiwan at the end of July.
    It is known that Donovan is a well-known American spy chief. During World War II, he served as the director of the American spy agency "Office of Strategic Services" and engaged in espionage activities in the Far East. Now, Donovan is the American Ambassador to Thailand. However, this grand title cannot conceal Donovan's identity as a spy, because American diplomats are actually engaged in espionage work. Another American spy chief, Allen Dulles, once said: "I worked in embassies in Berlin and Switzerland. I am not an intelligence officer, I am a diplomat, but I actually engage in espionage work." Looking at Donovan's history and profession, it is not difficult to understand that his purpose in going to Taiwan is clearly related to his espionage activities.
    Moreover, the American "International News Service" revealed: "Donovan has put forward some specific suggestions to the Chinese Kuomintang leaders regarding intelligence activities on the Chinese mainland."
    The facts are so. People watching the movements of Donovan and his ilk cannot help but say vigilantly: Beware of spies!
      Raising Bandits
    Half a month ago, the Associated Press reported: The U.S. Foreign Operations Administration has drafted a plan requesting the U.S. Congress to allocate $1.5 million to help counter-revolutionaries who have fled from the Far East and the Middle East, and intends to send some "intellectual leaders" from the "Chinese exiles" to Taiwan, because they are not only "helpful to American psychological warfare, but also helpful to Taiwan."
    Everyone remembers that in 1951, the U.S. Congress passed the so-called "Mutual Security Act," openly paying to raise "any selected personnel" residing in the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies or those who had fled from these countries, intending to form them into "armed forces" to carry out sabotage activities against these countries. Now, people see that the United States is going to use the same heinous means to help the remaining counter-revolutionaries who have fled from China to carry out activities to sabotage the People's Republic of China.
    However, Allen Dulles, the director of the American Central Intelligence Agency, who is responsible for this heinous work, cannot help but admit that although the United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in this area in the past, it has "gotten nothing." If so, will the United States get better results this time?
      Plunder and Exploitation
    According to news from Taiwan: The American "Economic Advisory Group" arrived in Taiwan on August 10 and will conduct activities in Taiwan for four to nine months. This "advisory group" is composed of six people: Eisenhower's economic assistant, Steffen, serves as the head of the group, followed by an executive secretary and four so-called experts in economic development, foreign exchange, finance, and taxation. It is worth noting that three of them have served as general managers or deputy general managers of major banks, and one is "connected with private companies."
    What are these American big bank bosses doing in Taiwan from thousands of miles away? According to Pan-Asia News Agency: Their mission is to: "Be responsible for on-the-spot investigation of Taiwan's economic strength, and submit important suggestions to Washington regarding American private investment here." To put it simply: plunder. "American private individuals" want to plunder Taiwan's natural resources, especially strategic resources!
    What are these American finance and taxation experts doing in Taiwan? It is said that they are to assist Taiwan in "drafting economic plans." To put it simply: exploitation. Help the Chiang bandit gang exploit the blood and sweat of the Taiwanese people, and then put it into the pockets of "American private individuals"!
      Recruiting Cannon Fodder
    On August 3, the Chiang bandit "Legislative Yuan" passed a so-called "Revised Military Service Law," stipulating that men in Taiwan between the ages of 18 and 45 must perform military service.
    Of course, this was done under the instructions of the United States. According to the "Washington Post," the American warmonger Van Fleet, who went to Taiwan not long ago to recruit cannon fodder, said: Chiang Kai-shek's army is getting older and older and needs "new blood." An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Taipei on August 4 also revealed: "The American military advisory group has been advising this for a long time," and they have also planned to conscript more than 100,000 Taiwanese youths every year to make the Chiang bandit army "completely rejuvenated" within three years.
    However, can they fight after "rejuvenation"? Even reporters from the Japanese "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun" expressed "doubt" about this.
    Naturally, this doubt is not without basis. Five years ago, when the Chiang bandit gang fought a civil war with the support of American money and guns, was their army still young? However, even the U.S. State Department's "White Paper" said that Chiang Kai-shek's army was an army that had "lost its fighting spirit" and expressed dissatisfaction with their defeat and surrender. Today, the United States continues to spend money and guns to do something that has failed in the past and is destined to fail in the future, which can only show its stupidity.

    美蒋匪帮罪行种种
        刺探情报
    美国驻泰国大使杜诺万，七月底曾到台湾进行了三天的“非正式访问”。
    人们知道，杜诺万是美国著名的特务头子。第二次世界大战期间，他曾当过美国特务机关“战略服务处”的处长，在远东进行过刺探情报的活动。现在，杜诺万是美国驻泰国大使。可是，这个堂皇的头衔也不能掩饰杜诺万的特务身分，因为美国的外交人员实际上就是做谍报工作的。美国的另一个特务头子艾伦·杜勒斯曾经说过：“我曾在柏林、瑞士的使馆里工作。我不是谍报人员，我是外交人员，但实际从事谍报工作。”看一看杜诺万的历史和职业，人们不难了解，他到台湾的目的显然是和他的特务活动有关系的。
    而且美国“国际新闻社”透露说：“杜诺万已经向中国国民党领袖提出了某些关于在中国大陆进行情报活动的具体建议。”
    事实如此。人们看着杜诺万之流的行踪不能不警惕地说：当心特务！
      豢养亡命之徒
    半月以前，美联社报道：美国援外事务管理署拟订了一项计划，要求美国国会拨款一百五十万美元，以便对从远东和中东逃出的反革命分子进行帮助，并且打算把“中国逃亡者”中的若干“知识界领袖”送往台湾，因为他们不仅对美国的“心理战有帮助，并且对台湾也有帮助”。
    大家还记得：一九五一年美国国会曾通过一项所谓“共同安全法”，公开出钱豢养居住在苏联和东欧人民民主国家中“任何挑选出来的人员”或从这些国家中逃出的人员，打算把他们组成“武装部队”，对这些国家进行破坏活动。现在，人们看到，美国又要用同样的万恶手段，来帮助从中国逃亡出去的残余反革命分子，进行破坏中华人民共和国的活动了。
    不过，负责这种万恶工作的美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯自己也不能不承认，美国过去虽然在这方面花费了几亿美元，可是“什么也没有得到”。既然如此，美国这一回难道就会得到更好的结果吗？
      掠夺和压榨
    据台湾消息透露：美国“经济顾问团”已在八月十日到达台湾，将在台湾进行四个月到九个月的活动。这个“顾问团”由六人组成：艾森豪威尔的经济助手斯特芬担任团长，下面有一个执行秘书和四个所谓经济开发、外汇、财政、税收专家。值得注意的是，其中有三人当过大银行的总经理或副总经理，有一人“与私人公司有联系”。
    这些美国的银行大老板不远千里前来台湾是为的什么？据泛亚社说：他们的使命是：“负责就地调查台湾的经济力量，并且向华盛顿提出关于美国私人在这里投资的重要建议。”说得简单些就是：掠夺。“美国私人”要掠尽台湾的天然资源，尤其是战略资源！
    这些美国的财政、税收之类的专家到台湾来又是为的什么？据说是要协助台湾“拟订经济计划”。说得简单些就是：压榨。帮助蒋匪帮压榨台湾人民的血汗，然后再把它装进“美国私人”的钱袋里去！
      搜罗炮灰
    八月三日，蒋匪“立法院”通过一项所谓“修正兵役法”，规定台湾十八岁到四十五岁的男子都要服兵役。
    当然，这件事是在美国指使下进行的。据“华盛顿邮报”说，不久前到台湾去搜罗炮灰的美国好战分子范佛里特说过：蒋介石军队愈来愈老了，需要“新的血液”。法新社八月四日台北电讯也透露：“美国军事顾问团长期以来就劝告这样做”，他们并且已经计划每年强征十万以上的台湾青年，在三年内使蒋匪军“全部恢复年轻”。
    然而，“恢复年轻”以后是否就可以打仗了呢？对于这一点，甚至日本“产业经济新闻”的记者也表示“怀疑”。
    自然，这种怀疑不是没有根据的。五年前，蒋匪帮在美国出钱出枪支持下打内战时，他们的军队还是年轻的吧？可是就连美国国务院的“白皮书”也说蒋介石的军队是“丧失斗志”的军队，对他们的失败和投降表示不满。今天，美国继续出钱出枪来干一件过去曾经失败过，今后注定还要失败的事情，这只能说明它的愚蠢而已。
