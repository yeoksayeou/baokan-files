Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, received the Japanese Peace Delegation and the Japanese Diet Members Delegation on the afternoon of the 3rd. He was accompanied by Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Liu Ningyi, Standing Committee Member, and Liu Guanyi, Secretary-General, among others. Kameta Togo, Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, was also present.

    Guo Moruo answered some questions raised by the two Japanese delegations. Guo Moruo said: Recently, voices from all walks of life in Japan demanding that Japan immediately restore normal relations with our country have become louder and louder. This desire is understandable and has won the sympathy and attention of the Chinese people. At present, the main obstacle to bringing Sino-Japanese relations back on track is that the Japanese government continues to follow the US government's policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China, which has 600 million people, and openly maintains so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang entrenched in Taiwan, the enemy of the Chinese people.

    Guo Moruo continued: China has always followed a peaceful foreign policy. We advocate that relations between countries should be based on the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, as a solid foundation for peace and security. Recently, these principles were reaffirmed in the joint statements of the prime ministers of China and India, and China and Burma, and were enthusiastically supported by people all over the world, especially in Asian countries. These principles should naturally also apply to Sino-Japanese relations.

    When talking about Sino-Japanese trade and cultural exchanges, Guo Moruo said: Sino-Japanese trade has broad prospects for development. It is regrettable that the actual implementation of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement in the past two years has been unsatisfactory, and the exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan are still one-sided. We hope that this situation can be improved in the future.

    Guo Moruo expressed sympathy for the damage suffered by Japanese fishermen and the fishing industry due to the US hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific. He said: Relevant departments in our country are studying the fishery issue between China and Japan. Guo Moruo pointed out: It must be stated that today, when normal relations have not yet been established between China and Japan, especially when the United States is using Japan as a military base and driving the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan to constantly harass China's coastal areas, the Chinese people must be vigilant in the coastal areas for the sake of national security. Guo Moruo hoped that the gentlemen of the delegation would explain this situation to Japanese fishermen and the fishing industry who are truly engaged in fishing.

    In addition, Guo Moruo also answered questions about pardoning a group of former Japanese soldiers who had committed various crimes to return to their country, and continuing to assist individual Japanese nationals in China who wished to return to their country.

    Shojiro Matsuura, head of the Japanese Diet Members Delegation, and Kenjiro Yanagida, head of the Japanese Peace Delegation, expressed their gratitude for the friendship of the Chinese people towards the Japanese people during the talks, and unanimously stated that they would continue to work for the peaceful and friendly relations between the two peoples of China and Japan.

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若
    接见日本和平代表团和国会议员代表团
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席、中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席郭沫若在三日下午接见了日本和平代表团和日本国会议员代表团，陪同接见的有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志，常务委员刘宁一，秘书长刘贯一等人。亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副秘书长龟田东伍也在座。
    郭沫若答复了日本两代表团所提出的一些问题。郭沫若说：最近日本各界人士要求日本立即和我国恢复正常关系的呼声越来越高，这种愿望是可以理解的，并且获得中国人民的同情与重视。目前将中日关系纳入常轨的主要障碍，是日本政府继续追随美国政府而采取敌视六亿人民的中华人民共和国的政策，并公然与中国人民公敌、盘踞台湾的蒋介石匪帮维持所谓“外交关系”。
    郭沫若继续指出：中国一向遵循和平的外交政策。我们主张各国之间的关系，应该根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利与和平共处的原则，来作为和平与安全的坚固基础。最近，这些原则在中印、中缅总理的联合声明中又被确定，并为全世界特别是亚洲各国人民所热烈支持。这些原则自然也应该适用于中日两国的关系上。
    谈到中日贸易和文化交流问题时，郭沫若说：中日贸易是有广阔的发展前途的。令人遗憾的是：两年来中日贸易协议的实际执行情况不能令人满意，中日两国人民间的往来也还只是片面的。我们希望这种情况今后能有所改善。
    郭沫若对日本渔民和渔业界由于美国在太平洋试验氢弹所受到的损害表示同情。他说：我国有关方面正在就中日间渔业问题加以研究中。郭沫若指出：必须说明，在中日两国之间正常关系尚未建立的今天，特别是美国正在以日本为军事基地并驱使台湾蒋介石匪帮不断骚扰我国沿海的情况下，中国人民为了国家的安全，就不能不在沿海各地提高警惕。郭沫若希望代表团各位先生向日本真正从事渔业的渔民和渔业界说明这种情况。
    此外，郭沫若还答复了关于宽赦一批犯有各种罪行的前日本军人回国、继续协助在中国的个别愿意归国的日侨回国等问题。
    日本国会议员代表团团长松浦周太郎和日本和平代表团团长柳田谦十郎在谈话时对于中国人民对日本人民的友谊表示感谢，并一致表示要为中日两国人民的和平友好关系而继续努力。
