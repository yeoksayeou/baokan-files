Farmers in Suihua, Hailun and other counties in Heilongjiang Province are actively selling new wheat to the state. This year, the two counties planted more than 64,000 hectares of wheat, with an average yield of one ton per hectare. Many farmers, having just celebrated the harvest on the threshing floor, are immediately and joyfully selling their surplus wheat to the state to support national economic construction. The grain department of Suihua County purchased more than 20 tons of new wheat on August 18, more than 50 tons on August 19, and the amount exceeded 100 tons by August 21. As of August 21, the total amount of new wheat purchased and stored in the county was 759 tons. Many agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, Communist Party members, and Communist Youth League members in places such as Democratic Village in the Second District and Minxing Village in the Eighth District of Hailun County are actively taking the lead in selling surplus wheat to the state.

Before the new wheat purchase began, the grain departments of the two counties trained a group of grading personnel, and all grain depots set up reception rooms. State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives actively prepared agricultural production materials and daily necessities for farmers. In some areas, supply and marketing cooperatives also investigated farmers' needs through meetings of the board of directors and representatives of cooperative members. With the development of material supply work, the urban and rural markets in the two counties have become more active.

    绥化等县农民积极出卖小麦
    黑龙江省绥化、海伦两县的农民正积极向国家出售新小麦。这两个县今年种植小麦六万四千余公顷，平均每公顷收获小麦一吨。很多农民刚刚在打麦场上庆祝了丰收，便立刻欢天喜地的把多余的小麦卖给国家，支援国家经济建设。绥化县粮食部门在八月十八日收购新麦二十多吨，十九日收购了五十多吨，到二十一日，收购的数量便超过了一百吨；截止到八月二十一日，全县收购入库的新麦已经有七百五十九吨。海伦县第二区民主村、第八区民醒村等地的许多农业生产合作社、互助组和共产党员、青年团员正积极带头把多余的小麦卖给国家。
    在开始收购新麦以前，两县粮食部门都训练了一批验级人员，各粮栈都设立了招待室。国营商业部门和供销合作社积极准备了农业生产资料和农民的生活用品；有些地区的供销合作社还通过召开理事会会议和社员代表会等办法，调查了农民的需要。随着物资供应工作的开展，两县城乡市场更加活跃。
