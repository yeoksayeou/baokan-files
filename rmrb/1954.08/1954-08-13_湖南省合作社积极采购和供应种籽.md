Hunan Province Cooperatives Actively Purchase and Supply Seeds

    The Preparatory Committee of the Hunan Provincial Cooperative Union has already purchased a large quantity of buckwheat, potatoes and other late autumn crop seeds from Hubei, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and other provinces to meet the needs of non-disaster areas in the province for over-quota production and disaster areas for replanting.

    In order to purchase seeds, the Preparatory Committee of the Hunan Provincial Cooperative Union has sent dozens of cadres to six or seven provinces. In order to quickly transfer the purchased seeds to various places, the cooperative established transfer stations in Hengyang, Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang, Miluo, Lengshuitan and other six places. Due to the adoption of direct transportation or nearby allocation methods, the transit time was greatly shortened, and transportation costs were saved.

    In the process of the cooperative purchasing and transferring seeds, the relevant departments in Hunan Province actively assisted. For example, the Department of Agriculture sent a group of technical cadres to various provinces to assist in the acceptance of seeds; the Department of Food helped find a large number of warehouses in Changsha; the transportation department prepared a large number of vehicles and ships for the cooperative. The Chinese Communist Party committees, people's governments, and national transportation departments of other provinces also provided strong support. For example, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on the use of late-season crop seeds to support Hunan farmers; the railway department gave priority to loading and transporting this batch of seeds in the case of busy passenger and freight transportation; the Food Department of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government transferred 70% of its inventory of buckwheat seeds to Hunan. Now, these seeds are being transported to Hunan Province in a steady stream. More than 1.3 million catties of buckwheat seeds have been transported to the six transfer stations in Hengyang, Changsha, etc. These transfer stations are transferring these seeds to hilly areas, mountainous areas, and flood-stricken areas to meet the needs of farmers for over-quota production and replanting. In addition, supply and marketing cooperatives in hilly and mountainous areas of Hunan Province also carried out the inter-regional adjustment of miscellaneous grain seeds. Hengyang Prefecture has allocated 50,000 catties of mud bean seeds to Chenxian Prefecture, and Longhui County has transferred more than 1 million catties of potato seeds to other counties in Shaoyang Prefecture.

    湖南省合作社积极采购和供应种籽
    湖南省合作社联合社筹备委员会已经在湖北、广西、浙江、江西等省购妥大批荞麦、马铃薯等晚秋作物种籽，供应该省非灾区超额增产和灾区补种的需要。
    湖南省合作社联合社筹备委员会为了采购种籽，先后派出的干部有数十人，到过六、七个省。为了使采购到的种籽迅速转运到各地，该社在衡阳、长沙、株州、岳阳，汨罗、冷水滩等六处设立了转运据点。由于采取直接运输或就近调拨的方法，中途运转时间大为缩短，同时节约了运输费用。
    在合作社采办和调运种籽的过程中，湖南省各有关部门都积极予以协助。如农业厅曾派出一批技术干部到各省协助验收种籽；粮食厅帮助在长沙找妥了大批仓库；交通运输部门为合作社准备了大量车辆、船只。外省中共党委、人民政府和国家交通运输部门也给了有力的支持。如中共浙江省委、中共广西省委等都曾号召用晚季作物种籽支援湖南农民；铁路部门在客运、货运繁忙的情况下，优先装运这批种籽；广西省人民政府粮食厅将百分之七十的库存荞麦种籽调给了湖南。现在，这些种籽正源源运到湖南省。已经运到衡阳、长沙等六处转运据点的荞麦种，就有一百三十多万斤。这些转运据点正在将这些种籽向丘陵区、山区和水灾区调运，供应农民超额增产和补种的需要。另外，湖南省丘陵区和山区的供销合作社也进行了地区间调剂杂粮种籽的工作。衡阳专区已调拨五万斤泥豆种给郴县专区，隆回县调剂给邵阳专区其他县的马铃薯种在一百万斤以上。
