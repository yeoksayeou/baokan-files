    “Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!” Chinese Edition, 1954, No. 33, Contents Introduction
    The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties organ "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 33, 1954, has been published.

    This issue features an editorial entitled "Self-Criticism and Criticism from Below are Powerful Weapons for Improving Party Work." The editorial points out that criticism and self-criticism are the laws of development for Communist and Workers' Parties and powerful weapons for strengthening the Party. Based on the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist and Workers' Parties of people's democratic countries consider vigorously developing criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below, as one of their primary tasks. There are many arduous tasks in the process of building socialism. One of the great contributions of criticism from below is that it can promptly discover shortcomings, foresee difficulties, and use the rich experience and wisdom of the millions of masses to successfully complete the task of building socialism. Under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, the working people of the people's democratic countries have achieved remarkable successes. However, some undesirable phenomena have also emerged along with it. Some people with insufficient political cultivation have become careless, arrogant, and boastful in the face of great achievements, and these phenomena are very dangerous. We should always remember that the construction of a new society is carried out in the context of a fierce class struggle between the old and dying things and all the new things. In order to advance victoriously, it is necessary to carry out criticism and self-criticism. However, self-criticism and criticism from below cannot be unfolded automatically in a spontaneous manner. Conditions must be created so that all honest laborers can boldly and fearlessly criticize the shortcomings in the work of any organization and institution. It is necessary to use newspapers and periodicals to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and to handle the letters from the working people to Party and state organs conscientiously and promptly. The inestimable importance of criticism and self-criticism lies in the fact that it is a powerful driving force for promoting the Communist and Workers' Parties to advance, in that it can enhance the strength of the Party and help to bring into play the creativity of the working people. The more the Communist and Workers' Parties care about the Marxist-Leninist cultivation of their members, the more they strengthen inner-Party democracy and carry out self-criticism and criticism from below, the more smoothly they will be able to accomplish their great and glorious tasks.

    This issue contains important articles such as "Collective Leadership Guarantees the Victory of the Chinese Communist Party" by An Ziwen, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and "The German People and European Collective Security" by Ka. Shidewan, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party.

    Shidewan's article points out that the Soviet proposal to conclude a pan-European collective security treaty effectively helped the peace-loving forces to fight against the "European Defense Community" treaty and against the revival of German militarism. Only a minority of West German residents support the Adenauer regime's policy of reviving German militarism. More and more people are in favor of the German people conducting their own consultations. The note put forward by the Soviet government on July 24 is of great significance for raising the national consciousness and democratic understanding of the whole of Germany. At present, residents of West Germany, many politicians, economists, and scientists in West Germany are also discussing the Soviet proposals. The great significance of these proposals for the future of Germany cannot be denied. The German people are undergoing a severe test. Just as they must do their utmost to fight for the unification and democracy of their motherland, despite many sacrifices, they cannot shirk the responsibility of participating in the solution of the European peace problem.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第三十三期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第三十三期中文版已经出版。
    本期以“自我批评和自下而上的批评是改进党的工作的有力武器”为题发表社论。社论指出：批评和自我批评是共产党和工人党发展的法则，是增强党的力量的有力武器。人民民主国家的共产党和工人党根据苏联共产党的经验，认为大力开展批评和自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，是它们的主要任务之一。在建设社会主义的过程中有很多艰巨的任务。自下而上的批评的伟大贡献之一就在于它能够及时发现缺点，能够预见到困难，能够用千百万群众的丰富经验和智慧来胜利地完成建设社会主义的任务。人民民主国家的劳动人民在共产党和工人党的领导下已经取得了卓越的成就。但是，随着也产生了一些不好的现象。有些政治修养不够的人，在巨大的成就面前变得漫不经心、骄傲自满、大言不惭了，这些现象都是非常危险的。我们应该时刻记住：建设新社会是在旧的与垂死的事物跟一切新生的事物进行剧烈的阶级斗争的情况下进行的。为了胜利地前进，就必须开展批评和自我批评。但是自我批评和自下而上的批评不能以自流的方式自动地展开。必须创造条件使一切正直的劳动者都能大胆无畏地批评任何组织和机关工作中的缺点。要利用报刊开展批评和自我批评，切实而及时地处理劳动人民给党机关和国家机关的来信。批评和自我批评的无可估量的重要性就在于它是推动共产党和工人党前进的强大动力，在于它能增强党的力量并有助于发挥劳动人民的创造力。共产党和工人党越是关心党员的马克思列宁主义的修养，越是加强党内民主和开展自我批评和自下而上的批评，它们也就越能顺利地完成它们伟大而光荣的任务。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：中国共产党中央组织部副部长安子文的“集体领导保证了中国共产党的胜利”，德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员卡·希德万的“德国人民和欧洲集体安全”等。
    希德万的文章指出：苏联提出的缔结全欧集体安全条约这一建议有效地帮助了爱好和平的力量进行反对“欧洲防务集团”条约和反对复活德国军国主义的斗争。西德居民中只有少数人支持阿登纳政权所奉行的复活德国军国主义的政策。赞成德国人民自己进行协商的人越来越多了。苏联政府于七月二十四日提出的照会对于提高整个德国的民族觉悟和民主认识具有重大的意义。目前，西德的居民、西德的许多政治家、经济学家和科学家也都在讨论苏联的建议。这些建议对于德国的前途的巨大意义是不容否认的。德国人民正在经历严重的考验。正如他们尽管要遭到许许多多的牺牲也不能不尽他们的最大努力来为祖国的统一和民主而斗争一样，他们也同样不能推卸参加解决欧洲和平问题的责任。
