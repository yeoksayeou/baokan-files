    The bourgeoisie in capitalist countries, after seizing state power, have formulated and promulgated many constitutions and constitutional documents in order to consolidate the capitalist social system and state system, and to deceive and rule the broad masses of working people. Bourgeois politicians and their apologists have portrayed bourgeois constitutions as "for all the people," "equal," and "democratic" in order to conceal their class nature. In fact, bourgeois constitutions safeguard and consolidate the capitalist system of exploitation and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie; they are tools for the ruling nation to enslave and suppress oppressed nations; the democracy granted by bourgeois constitutions is always, and can only be, narrow, incomplete, and hypocritical.

    Marxist-Leninist classic writers have repeatedly exposed the class nature of bourgeois constitutions, pointing out their deceptive nature. The U.S. Constitution, a major representative of bourgeois constitutions, and the history of the United States, particularly the reality of the lives of the people in the United States under bourgeois rule after World War II, powerfully demonstrate the correctness of this assertion.

    The U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787. In addition to a brief preamble, the main body consists of seven articles. In addition, there are twenty-one articles supplementing or amending the main text. This constitution played a progressive role at a certain historical stage. It served as a "model" for the constitutions of many bourgeois countries thereafter. Bourgeois politicians and their apologists unanimously tout the U.S. Constitution as the "most democratic" constitution in the world. However, "boasting" can never withstand scientific analysis and the test of facts! Historical developments have increasingly shown that the U.S. Constitution, like the constitutions of all other bourgeois countries, is merely a tool used by the bourgeoisie to deceive and rule the broad masses of working people.

    The U.S. Constitution begins by stating, "promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity..." Such wording is grand and imposing. But what are the facts? Everyone knows that the vast majority of working people in the United States have long been plunged into abject poverty due to the capitalists' cruel exploitation and plunder. For example, according to 1949 statistics, the income of the lower 40 percent of working people, who constituted the population at that time, accounted for only 12 percent of the total national income, and this proportion is decreasing day by day. According to a recent estimate by Academician Varga of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the number of completely unemployed people in the United States has actually reached about six million, and the number of partially unemployed people is even greater. On the other hand, American monopoly capitalists made a net profit of 38 billion U.S. dollars in World War I; during World War II, from 1940 to 1945, they made a net profit of 53 billion U.S. dollars in six years; and in the Korean War, from June 1950 to the end of 1952 alone, they made a profit of 107 billion U.S. dollars. In the United States, huge amounts of wealth are concentrated in the hands of nine family or local monopoly capitalist groups such as Morgan, Rockefeller, Kuhn-Loeb, Mellon, Chicago, DuPont, Cleveland, Boston, and Ford.

    This shows that as long as the capitalist system of exploitation continues to rule, the so-called "promote the general Welfare" is actually only promoting the welfare of a few bourgeoisie, and the so-called "Blessings of Liberty" of the "Posterity" are actually only the freedom and happiness of a small group of capitalists; for the working people, there is no welfare to speak of. The U.S. Constitution is intended to forever protect the private property of capitalists and protect the sinful system of man exploiting man, because this is the economic foundation of capitalist countries.

    Based on the bourgeois doctrine of "separation of powers, checks and balances," the U.S. Constitution stipulates a state system in which the legislative, executive, and judicial branches are separated and mutually restrained. At the same time, it stipulates that members of Congress and the President are elected by the people; judges of the Supreme Court are nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Senate. In fact, state power is indivisible; legislation, administration, and justice are merely the internal division of labor within state power. In reality, members of Congress, the President, and judges of the Supreme Court are birds of a feather; they are all stewards in charge of bourgeois state affairs under the direct command of the bosses of Wall Street. The so-called "separation of powers" is merely a disguise for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

    One only needs to look at the composition of the members of Congress, the list of government cabinet members, and the actions of the Supreme Court judges to understand the matter clearly enough.

    Take the 81st Congress as an example. The composition of this Congress was as follows: In the Senate, among the ninety-six senators, there were sixteen industrial capitalists, nine agricultural capitalists, and sixty-six lawyers—loyal defenders of the bourgeoisie who rely on providing legal advice to large companies; in the House of Representatives, among the four hundred and thirty-five representatives, there were eighty-one industrial capitalists, thirty-seven agricultural capitalists, and two hundred and thirty-five lawyers. Among all the representatives and senators, there was not a single representative of the workers and peasants who constitute the vast majority of the population.

    Take the current government as an example. In this government, in addition to President Eisenhower, who is a well-known and recently promoted loyal lackey of the bourgeoisie by Wall Street, Secretary of State Dulles is a partner in the Wall Street law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, a director of the famous munitions company International Nickel Company, and a political representative of the Rockefeller and Morgan monopoly groups; Secretary of Defense Wilson and Deputy Secretary Keys are the general manager and deputy general manager of the world's largest automobile manufacturing company, General Motors; Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey is a giant in the coal, iron, steel, chemical, transportation, and banking industries and the chairman of the executive committee of Cleveland Citibank; Secretary of the Interior McKay is a major dealer for General Motors; Attorney General Brownell is the deputy general manager of American World Trade Corporation; and the chairman of the special committee responsible for adjusting government administrative departments is Nelson Rockefeller, a member of the Rockefeller monopoly group family. All the important positions in the entire government are directly controlled by the tycoons of Wall Street.

    As for the U.S. Supreme Court, Marx pointed out as early as in "The North American Civil War": "This court, with nine judges, five of whom belong to the South, has long been the most submissive tool of the slave owners." In the countless trials and persecutions of leaders of the American Communist Party and other progressive people in the United States in recent years, the judges of the U.S. Supreme Court have increasingly demonstrated their identity as slaves of the bourgeoisie.

    Such state organs are obviously only able to serve the capitalists.

    The U.S. Constitution grandly stipulates that slavery is prohibited within the United States. It has also publicly declared the principle of equality and equal rights for all nations and races, and stipulates that the right to vote shall not be denied on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.

    However, slavery has not been abolished in the United States; and the constitutional principle of equality and equal rights for all nations and races has never been realized in the United States. Black people are the most tragic victims of national oppression and racial discrimination policies. In the United States, black people have not been liberated, and they are still in a state of slavery without personal protection and freedom.

    The laws of many states violate the Constitution and openly stipulate "racial segregation" clauses. In trains, buses, and movie theaters, separate seats are set up for blacks, separated from whites. Even in churches, black people's seats are separated from ordinary seats. Black people are considered to be committing a crime if they violate these regulations and associate with white people without authorization. White people often rape black women, but always get away with it. Conversely, black people are often falsely accused of raping white people and sentenced to death. The well-known case of the U.S. court in Mississippi executing black man Willie McGee in 1951 and the case of executing seven black people in Martinsville, Virginia, are the most prominent examples. The "lynching system" that originated from the slave system is still prevalent in the United States. The notorious "Ku Klux Klan" is the most brutal executor of the "lynching system" that abuses and kills black people. Black people are often "lynched" to death. The sensational incident in 1946 in Georgia in which Ku Klux Klan members executed black couple Toalsey and Malcolm couple is just one of countless lynching incidents. The murderers in this incident are still at large under the protection of the FBI.

    As for the right to vote, it is even more out of the question for black people. The fifteen million black people, who account for one-tenth of the U.S. population, are almost entirely deprived of the right to vote under various restrictions.

    In addition, in the United States, the remnants of the red Indian people, who were once a race that multiplied, are now living in designated areas and are on the verge of extinction. And Jews, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Slavs, Orientals, and other ethnic minorities in the United States are also suffering from inhuman treatment of national oppression and racial discrimination.

    This is the essence of the provisions on equality and equal rights for all nations and races in the U.S. Constitution.

    The U.S. Constitution formally endows the people with various "inviolable" rights and freedoms. However, these so-called "rights" and "freedoms" have actually never been anything more than empty talk on paper without material guarantees, except for capitalists. The many fascist decrees promulgated by the U.S. government in recent years, and the actions of the fascist bosses, have more openly denied and canceled these freedoms and rights.

    The American people call the "Taft-Hartley Act," which came into effect on August 22, 1947, the "slave law." Because this decree cancels all the achievements that the American working class has gained through more than a hundred years of bloody struggle. It stipulates that leaders of trade unions should swear not to believe in the policies promoted by the Communist Party; it prohibits the central organs of trade unions from issuing instructions to members of trade unions across the country; it prohibits trade unions from engaging in any political activities, etc.

    The notorious "Smith Act" stipulates the so-called "treason." In 1949, the New York Federal Court, based on this act, fabricated charges, falsely accused the American Communist Party of attempting to overthrow the government by force, and began an illegal trial of the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party. In June 1951, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that this act was "not unconstitutional" and, based on it, announced that it would uphold the original judgment of the New York Federal Court, throwing the outstanding sons of the American people into prison.

    The "McCarran Act" (the so-called "Internal Security Act") formulated and promulgated in 1950 stipulates the establishment of concentration camps in the United States in order to imprison people "suspected of conspiracy to subvert activities" in the so-called "emergency period." It also stipulates that the Communist Party and other organizations considered to be "foreign spies" must register.

    Last year, the loyal and unyielding warriors fighting for democracy and peace—the heroic Rosenberg couple—were executed under the "McCarran Act" and the "Smith Act" on the so-called "treason" charge of being "atomic spies."

    Truman's anti-democratic "loyalty investigation" decree came into effect on March 21, 1947. Since then, a large-scale "purge" movement has begun. Over the years, based on this decree, thousands of good American citizens have been "fired" after being labeled as "disloyal," often for a very insignificant matter. The University of Oregon dismissed a professor simply because he proposed that the genetic theory researched by Academician Lysenko of the Soviet Academy of Sciences be tested. It is well known that along with dismissal comes the tracking and persecution of the "McCarran Act" and the "Smith Act."

    Using these fascist laws as tools, the U.S. secret service agencies and fascists are stepping up the persecution of Communist Party and trade union leaders, progressive people, workers, people of color, and millions of good American citizens. The "Un-American Activities Investigation Committee" has long compiled a blacklist including thousands of trade union leaders, professors, staff, scholars, pastors, doctors, actors, writers, and broadcasters. In the files of secret service boss—FBI Director Hoover, there are fingerprints of one hundred and thirteen million American citizens recorded. Secret agents searched private letters everywhere and eavesdropped on private phone calls. "McCarthyism" has become increasingly rampant since the Republican Party came to power. Not only Communists and progressive people have been persecuted, but even people who slightly disagree with McCarthy have been labeled as "Communists" and subjected to "investigation."

    In the United States, freedom of assembly has long become empty talk. The atrocities committed by fascist reactionaries in Peekskill in August 1949 were the greatest mockery of the so-called "freedom of assembly" stipulated in the U.S. Constitution. Fascist thugs later threatened to "lynch" the famous black singer, leader of the American Progressive Party, Paul Robeson.

    In the United States, large-scale book clearing and book burning reactionary measures have begun. Many schools in Los Angeles followed the orders of the municipal authorities and banned the reading of Mark Twain's works, because "Mark Twain's call against war destroyed the 'morality' of ordinary Americans!" The government confiscated the works of Darwin, Dreiser, and many other world-renowned scholars, writers, and politicians from the libraries of many colleges.

    This is the "civil rights" enjoyed by the American people today! This is the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" of modern America!

    At the end of 1952, in Washington, under the chairmanship of Truman, the original manuscript of the U.S. Constitution was buried in an air-raid shelter. In fact, the "democracy" and "freedom" touted by the U.S. Constitution had long been buried by living history.

    All of this is determined by the basic economic laws of modern capitalism. The bankruptcy of bourgeois constitutions and the increasing tendency of bourgeois legal systems to collapse are the inevitable result of the deepening general crisis of capitalism, and it is also a sign of the inevitable demise of the capitalist system.

    As Stalin once pointed out, today, in capitalist countries, "the principles of equality of people and equality of nations are trampled upon," and "the banner of bourgeois democratic freedoms has been thrown aside."

    However, the banner of democracy and freedom is being raised by the American Communist Party and representatives of other democratic parties in the United States who love freedom and peace. Inspired by socialist-type constitutions, uniting more and more people and masses, and forging ahead courageously!

    美国宪法的欺骗性
    张尚鷟
    资本主义国家的资产阶级在夺得了国家权力以后，为了把资本主义社会制度和国家制度固定起来，为了欺骗和统治广大劳动人民，曾经制定并颁布过许多宪法和宪法性的文件。资产阶级的政客和御用学者们，为了掩盖资产阶级宪法的阶级本质，把资产阶级宪法说成是“全民的”“平等的”“民主的”宪法。事实上，资产阶级宪法所维护与巩固的，是资本主义的剥削制度和资产阶级专政；资产阶级宪法乃是统治民族奴役并镇压被压迫民族的工具；资产阶级宪法所给予的民主始终是，也不能不是狭隘的、残缺的、虚伪的民主。
    马克思列宁主义的经典作家们，曾不止一次地揭露过资产阶级宪法的阶级本质，指出资产阶级宪法的欺骗性。资产阶级宪法主要代表之一的美国宪法，和美国的历史，特别是二次世界大战以后美国国内在资产阶级统治下的人民生活的真象，有力地说明了这一论断的正确性。
    美国宪法是在一七八七年制定的。除简短的序言外，本文共包括七个条文。此外，还有二十一个补充或修正宪法本文的条文。这个宪法，在一定的历史阶段上，是曾起过一些进步作用的。它曾是以后许多资产阶级国家宪法摹仿的“榜样”。资产阶级的政客和御用学者们一致地将美国宪法吹嘘为世界上“最民主”的宪法。但是，“吹嘘”永远是经不住科学的分析和事实的考验的！历史的发展日益显著地证明着：美国宪法，正如所有其他资产阶级国家的宪法一样，只不过是资产阶级用以欺骗和统治广大劳动人民的工具。
    美国宪法开宗明义就提出“增进全民之福利，并谋今后国民永久乐享自由之幸福……”。这种字句是冠冕堂皇的。但事实怎样呢？谁都知道，由于资本家的残酷剥削和掠夺，美国广大劳动人民久已陷于赤贫。例如，根据一九四九年的统计，占当时美国人口百分之四十的下层劳动人民的收入，只占全部国民收入的百分之十二，而这个比例数还正在日益降低。根据苏联科学院瓦尔加院士最近的估计，在美国，完全失业的人数实际上已达到了六百万人左右，半失业的人数则还要多些。而另一方面，美国垄断资本家在第一次世界大战中获得净利三百八十亿美元；在第二次世界大战期间，从一九四○年到一九四五年的六年中，获得净利五百三十亿美元；在侵朝战争中，仅从一九五○年六月到一九五二年年底，就获得了利润一千零七十亿美元。在美国，巨额的财富集中在摩根、洛克菲勒、库恩—洛伯、梅隆、芝加哥、杜邦、克利夫兰、波士顿和福特等九个家族的或地方性的垄断资本家集团手中。
    这就说明了，只要资本主义剥削制度继续统治，那么，所谓“增进全民之福利”，实际上只是增进少数资产阶级的福利，所谓“国民”的“自由之幸福”，实际上只是一小撮资本家的自由的幸福；对劳动人民来说，是没有福利可言的。美国宪法就是要永远保护资本家的私有财产，保护罪恶的人剥削人的制度，因为这是资本主义国家的经济基础。
    美国宪法根据资产阶级“分权、制衡”的国家学说，规定了立法、行政、司法三权分立并互相牵制的国家制度。同时又规定了国会议员与总统均由人民选举；最高法院的法官由总统提名并经参议院同意以后任命。其实，国家权力是不可分的，立法、行政、司法只不过是国家权力内部的分工。实际上美国国会议员、总统和最高法院的法官是一丘之貉，他们都是在华尔街老板直接指挥下，执掌资产阶级国家事务的管事人。所谓“三权分立”，不过是资产阶级专政的掩盖形式。
    只消看一看国会议员的成份和政府阁员的名单，以及最高法院法官们的所作所为，事情就够明白了。
    以第八十一届国会为例。这一届国会议员的成份如下：在参议院里，九十六个参议员中，有十六个工业资本家，九个农业资本家，六十六个律师——依靠替大公司作法律顾问吃饭的资产阶级的忠实辩护人；在众议院里，四百三十五个众议员中，有八十一个工业资本家，三十七个农业资本家，二百三十五个律师。全部众议员和参议员中没有一个占人口绝大多数的工人和农民的代表。
    以现任政府为例。在这个政府中，除总统艾森豪威尔是众所周知的新近被华尔街捧上台的资产阶级的忠实走卒以外，国务卿杜勒斯，是华尔街苏利文与克朗威尔律师事务所的合伙人，著名的军火公司——国际镍公司的董事，洛克菲勒和摩根垄断集团的政治代表；国防部长威尔逊和副部长凯斯，是资本主义世界最大的汽车制造公司——美国通用汽车公司的总经理和副总经理；财政部长汉弗莱，是煤、铁、钢、化学、运输和银行业的巨头和克利夫兰花旗银行执行委员会的主席；内政部长麦凯，是通用汽车公司的一个大代理商；司法部长布朗纳尔，是美国世界贸易公司的副总经理；负责调整政府行政部门的特别委员会的主席，是洛克菲勒垄断集团的家族纳尔逊·洛克菲勒。全部政府中的要职，都是直接由华尔街的大亨们掌握着的。
    至于谈到美国最高法院，马克思早在“北美的内战”一文中就指出过：“这个有着法官九人，其中五个人是属于南方的法庭，很久以来就是奴隶主底最驯从的工具。”在最近几年来无数次审判并迫害美国共产党领袖和美国其他进步人士的事件中，美国最高法院的法官们已日益显示了他们作为资产阶级奴仆的身份。
    这样的国家机关，显然，是只能为资本家服务的。
    美国宪法冠冕堂皇地规定着：在合众国境内，禁止有奴隶制的存在。它也曾公开地宣布过各民族和种族平等平权的原则，规定选举权不得因种族、肤色或因从前曾为奴隶的关系而被剥夺。
    但是，奴隶制在美国并没有废除；民族和种族平等平权的宪法原则，在美国也从来就不曾实现过。黑人就是民族压迫和种族歧视政策的最悲惨的牺牲者。在美国，黑人并没有得到解放，他们依然处于毫无人身保护与自由权利的奴隶的地位。
    许多州的法律违反宪法地公然规定着“种族隔离”的条文。在火车中、公共汽车中和电影院里，都为黑人另设了与白人隔离开的座位。甚至在教堂里，黑人的座位也是跟普通座位隔开的。黑人如果违反这些规定而擅自与白人交往，都被认为是犯罪。白人时常强奸黑人女子，但结果总是逍遥法外。相反，黑人却经常被诬为强奸白人而被判处死刑。众所周知的一九五一年美国法院在密士失必州处死黑人威利·麦基的案件和处死弗吉尼亚州马丁斯维尔城七个黑人的案件，就是最显著的例子。美国至今依然盛行着从奴隶制度基础上产生出来的“私刑制度”。臭名昭著的“三K党”是虐杀黑人的“私刑制度”的最凶残的执行人。经常有黑人被“私刑”处死。轰动一时的一九四六年乔治亚州三K党徒处死黑人陶尔赛夫妇和马尔柯夫妇的事件，只不过是无数私刑事件中的一个而已。这一事件的杀人凶犯们，在联邦调查局的庇护之下，至今仍逍遥法外。
    至于选举权，那在黑人就更谈不到了。占美国人口十分之一的一千五百万黑人，在重重限制之下，几乎全被剥夺了投票的权利。
    除此以外，在美国，那曾经是种族繁衍的红色印第安人的遗族，现在正住在被圈定的地区内濒于灭种。而犹太人、墨西哥人、波多黎各人、斯拉夫人、东方人以及其他美国境内的少数民族，也同样地正在遭受着民族压迫和种族歧视的非人待遇。
    这就是美国宪法中关于各民族、种族平等平权的规定的实质。
    美国宪法形式地赋予人民以各种“不可侵犯的”权利和自由。然而，这些所谓“权利”和“自由”，除了对资本家以外，实际上从来就是没有物质保证的纸上空谈。美国政府近年来所颁布的许多法西斯法令，和法西斯头子们的所作所为，更公开地否认并取消了这些自由和权利。
    美国人民把一九四七年八月二十二日生效的“塔虎脱——哈特莱法”称做“奴隶法”。因为这个法令取消了美国工人阶级百余年来流血斗争所获得的一切成果。它规定职工会的领导者应宣誓不信仰共产党所宣传的政策；它禁止职工会的中央机关对全国职工会员发布指示；它禁止职工会从事任何政治活动，等等。
    臭名远扬的“史密斯法”，规定了所谓“叛国罪”。一九四九年，纽约联邦法院根据这一法案，捏造罪名，诬蔑美国共产党企图武力颠覆政府，而对美共十一位领袖开始了非法审讯。一九五一年六月，美国最高法院又肯定这一法案为“不违宪”，并根据它宣布维持纽约联邦法院的原判，将美国人民优秀的儿子们投入了监狱。
    一九五○年制定并公布的“麦卡伦法”（即所谓“国内安全法”）规定在美国建立集中营，以便在所谓“紧急时期”监禁“有阴谋颠覆活动嫌疑”的人。并规定共产党及其他被认为是“外国间谍”的组织均须登记。
    去年，为民主与和平而斗争的忠贞不屈的战士——英雄的罗森堡夫妇，就是按照“麦卡伦法”和
  “史密斯法”，以所谓“原子间谍”的“叛国”罪名而处死的。
    杜鲁门的反民主的“忠诚调查”法令，是自一九四七年三月二十一日生效的。从那时起就开始了大规模的“整肃”运动。几年来，根据这一法令，成千善良的美国公民，往往因为一件极不关重要的事情，在被扣上“不忠诚”的帽子以后被“解雇”了。奥勒冈大学解聘了一位教授，只因为他提议把苏联科学院李森科院士所研究出来的遗传理论加以实验。众所周知：随着解雇而来的，还有“麦卡伦法”和“史密斯法”的跟踪迫害。
    利用这些法西斯法律作工具，美国的特务机关和法西斯分子们正在加紧迫害共产党和职工会领袖、进步人士、工人群众、有色人种以及千百万美国善良公民。“非美活动调查委员会”早就编制好了包括成千上万职工会领袖、教授、职员、学者、牧师、医生、演员、作家和广播员的黑名单。在特务头子——联邦调查局局长胡佛的档案中，记录了一亿一千三百万美国公民的指纹。特务们到处搜查私人的信件，偷听私人的电话。“麦卡锡主义”随着共和党上台而日益猖獗了，不仅共产党和进步人士受到迫害，就是稍不合麦卡锡心意的人，也都被扣上了“共产党分子”的帽子而遭受到“调查”。
    在美国，集会自由早已成了空谈。一九四九年八月法西斯反动派在匹克斯干尔制造的暴行，是对美国宪法上规定的所谓“集会自由”的最大的嘲讽。法西斯暴徒们在事后还威胁着要将著名的黑人歌唱家、美国进步党领袖保尔·罗伯逊处以“私刑”。
    在美国，业已开始了大规模的清书和焚书的反动措施。洛杉矶的许多学校遵照市政当局的命令，禁止阅读马克·吐温的著作，因为“马克·吐温反对战争的号召，破坏了普通美国人的‘道德’！”政府在许多学院的图书馆中没收了达尔文、德莱赛以及其他许多世界闻名的学者、作家和政治家们的作品。
    这就是今天美国人民所享有的“公民权利”！这就是现代美国的所谓“民主”与“自由”！
    一九五二年年底，在华盛顿，由杜鲁门主持着，将美国宪法的原稿埋进了防空洞。事实上，美国宪法所标榜的“民主”与“自由”，老早就被活生生的历史埋葬了。
    所有这一切，都是由现代资本主义基本经济法则决定的。资产阶级宪法的破产和资产阶级法制的日益趋向于崩溃，是资本主义总危机日益加深的必然结果，它同时又是资本主义制度必然灭亡的前兆。
    正如斯大林所曾指出的一样，今天，在资本主义国家里，“人们平等和民族平等的原则被践踏了”，“资产阶级民主的自由这面旗帜已经被抛在一边了”。
    但是，民主和自由这面旗帜正被美国共产党和爱好自由与和平的美国其他民主政党的代表们高举着。在社会主义类型的宪法的鼓舞下，团结着愈来愈多的人民群众，奋勇前进！
