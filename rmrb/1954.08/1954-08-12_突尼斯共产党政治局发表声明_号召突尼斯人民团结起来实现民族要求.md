Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Paris: The French newspaper "l'Humanité" recently published a statement by the Political Bureau of the Tunisian Communist Party.

    The statement begins by pointing out that the Tunisian people welcome the French government's recognition of Tunisia's right to internal autonomy, considering it an important step towards national independence and the establishment of new relations between Tunisia and France. The Tunisian Communist Party has always affirmed that the Tunisian people are ready to negotiate with anyone who is genuinely seeking a solution to the Tunisian problem.
    The statement then points out that France's recognition of Tunisia's internal autonomy is the result of the heroic struggle of the Tunisian people. The statement also points out that the struggle of the fraternal Vietnamese people, the unreserved support of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the people's democratic countries, the Arab countries, and the Asian countries, the development of the peace movement, and the struggle of the French working class and people under the leadership of the French Communist Party, have enabled the Tunisian people to achieve great successes on the road to national independence and peace.
    The statement then points out that Franco-Tunisian negotiations can only succeed under the following conditions: amnesty for political prisoners, cancellation of all repressive measures, cessation of persecution of patriots, lifting of martial law, restoration of freedom of public activity and individual freedom, reinstatement of all workers dismissed for patriotic activities, cessation of sending large numbers of troops to Tunisia, and holding direct, equal, and secret universal suffrage to elect a Tunisian National Assembly, and the establishment of a government composed entirely of Tunisians that is responsible to this assembly. The statement emphasizes that negotiations should be conducted with representatives of all parties and associations participating in the national movement, especially representatives of the working class.
    The statement concludes by calling on the people of Tunisia, all patriots, and the working class to unite, calling on French workers in Tunisia to thwart the colonists' hostility movement, and calling on the people to maintain maximum vigilance in order to achieve national demands with the active support of the entire people.
