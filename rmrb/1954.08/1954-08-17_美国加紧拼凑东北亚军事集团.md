    The U.S. Intensifies Efforts to Assemble Northeast Asian Military Group
   [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] The American authorities are intensifying their efforts to piece together a Northeast Asian military bloc, attempting to expand their aggressive actions against China and create tension in the Far East.
    Not long ago, Van Fleet, who was ordered to the Far East to plan the expansion of puppet armies and the organization of aggressive blocs, clamored madly on the 10th to accelerate the organization of a military bloc including the Taiwan bandit gang, South Korea, and Japan, and to expand armed interference in our country. He called the Chiang bandit traitorous clique and the Syngman Rhee clique "first-rate friends who are worthy of being our East Asian allies." U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson also publicly stated on the same day that the United States would "spend more money" in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan to expand puppet armies and prepare for war. Prior to this, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated at a press conference that the United States was "studying" the issue of organizing a military bloc with the participation of the Taiwan bandit gang, South Korea, and Japan. The American lackeys in Taiwan and South Korea also echoed the call, eagerly expressing their willingness to spearhead new military adventures launched by the United States.
    According to reports from International News Service, diplomatic sources in Washington revealed that the United States has begun preliminary negotiations with the Taiwan bandit gang, South Korea, and Japanese reactionary forces regarding the establishment of a Northeast Asian military bloc. It is reported that the American plan is to have Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States each issue a statement stating that as long as the United States launches a new military adventure under the pretext of being "invaded," they will provide "assistance" and act as cannon fodder for the United States. At the same time, Van Fleet has submitted to the U.S. authorities a preliminary plan to expand the armies of Syngman Rhee and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Van Fleet has also repeatedly offered opinions to the committee of the U.S. Congress discussing the foreign aid bill for the 1955 fiscal year, vehemently advocating that after the ceasefire in Indochina, the United States should substantially increase military "aid" to Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, and accelerate the formation of a military aggression bloc to form an encirclement threatening China.
      However, due to realistic considerations of their own interests, the Japanese side
  is very apprehensive about joining a military aggression bloc with Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, who are despised by the world, to carry out military adventures for the United States. According to reports from International News Service, the suggestion made by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to establish a
  Northeast Asian military bloc "did not generate much enthusiasm" in Tokyo. Japan fears that "if Japan wholeheartedly allies itself with those two countries that rely on the United States for survival (referring to the Syngman Rhee clique and the Chiang bandit traitorous clique) in such a direct anti-communist treaty against the communists, Japan will be excluded from Asia for a long time." Moreover, "Japan's sovereignty may be damaged" and dragged into the very dangerous military adventures that Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek are stepping up preparations to launch. Japan also fears that participation in this military bloc aimed at China would hinder trade between Japan and China, thus hindering the stability of the Japanese economy. Therefore, "in the eyes of many Japanese, opposing such a treaty is a very realistic approach."

### 美国加紧拼凑东北亚军事集团

    美国加紧拼凑东北亚军事集团
   【新华社十六日讯】美国当局正在加紧拼凑东北亚军事集团，企图扩大对中国的侵略行动，并制造远东的紧张局势。
    不久以前奉命到远东来策划扩充傀儡军队和组织侵略集团的范佛里特，在十日又疯狂叫嚣要加紧组织包括台湾匪帮、南朝鲜和日本的军事集团，扩大对我国的武装干涉。他把蒋匪卖国集团和李承晚集团称做“是呱呱叫的朋友，是配得上做我们东亚的盟国的。”美国国防部部长威尔逊也在同一天公开表示，美国将在台湾、南朝鲜和日本“花更多的钱”，来扩充傀儡军队和进行战争准备。在这以前，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾在记者招待会上表示，美国正在
  “研究”组织有台湾匪帮、南朝鲜和日本参加的军事集团的问题。美国在台湾和南朝鲜的奴才们也跟着摇旗呐喊，迫不及待地表示愿为美国发动的新军事冒险打头阵。
    据国际新闻社报道，华盛顿方面的外交人士透露，美国已开始和台湾匪帮、南朝鲜和日本反动势力进行关于建立东北亚军事集团的初步谈判。据悉，美国的计划是要日本、南朝鲜、台湾和它一起分别发表一项声明，表示只要美国借口遭到“侵略”发动新的军事冒险，它们就要给予“援助”，为美国充当炮灰。同时，范佛里特已向美国当局提出了一份扩充李承晚和蒋介石匪帮的军队的初步计划。范佛里特还向美国国会讨论一九五五财政年度援外法案的委员会几次提出意见，竭力主张美国在印度支那停战以后，应该大量增加对台湾、南朝鲜和日本的军事“援助”，并加紧拼凑军事侵略集团，组成威胁中国的包围圈。
      但是，由于对自己利益的现实的考虑，日本方
  面对和全世界所不齿的蒋介石和李承晚组成军事侵略集团一道为美国进行军事冒险，表示十分疑惧。据国际新闻社报道，美国国务卿杜勒斯提出的建立
  东北亚军事集团的建议在东京“没有引起很大的热情”。日本害怕，“如果在这样一个直接针对共产党的反共条约中全心全意地和那两个依靠美国为生的国家（指李承晚集团和蒋匪卖国集团）联盟的话，日本将长期地被摈斥在亚洲之外。”而且，“日本的主权可能将受到损害”，被李承晚和蒋介石拖进他们正在加紧准备发动的十分危险的军事冒险中去。日本还害怕，如果参加这个矛头针对中国的军事集团，会阻碍日本和中国的贸易，因而妨碍日本经济的稳定。因此，“在许多日本人看来，反对这样的条约是非常现实的做法”。
