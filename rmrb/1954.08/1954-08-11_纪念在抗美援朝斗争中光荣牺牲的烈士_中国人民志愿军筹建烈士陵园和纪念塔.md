Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th. With the enthusiastic assistance of the Korean government, the Korean People's Army, and local Korean people, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is actively preparing to build martyrs' cemeteries and memorial towers to commemorate the martyrs who gloriously sacrificed in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

As early as April this year, the Headquarters and Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued instructions to the entire army on the construction of martyrs' cemeteries and memorial towers, and established the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery Construction Committee to specifically guide this work. The leading organs of the Volunteer Army's various units have also established martyrs' cemetery construction committees, which are carrying out preparatory work under the leadership of the heads of each unit.

According to the decision of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery Construction Committee, the martyrs who sacrificed in Korea will be buried in their original distribution locations, selecting appropriate sites to build martyrs' cemeteries in a concentrated manner, erecting tombstones and cemetery monuments, and building martyrs' memorial pavilions in famous battlefields such as Unsan, Kaechon, the shores of Changjin Lake, Shangganling, Kumsong, "Old Baldy Mountain," and other places of great commemorative significance. It was also decided to build a permanent memorial tower for martyrs in each of the three cities of Kaesong, Wonsan, and Sinuiju.

At present, the martyrs' cemetery construction committees of the Volunteer Army's various units have initially completed various preparatory tasks. Construction work is scheduled to begin in September.

    中国人民志愿军筹建烈士陵园和纪念塔
      【新华社平壤七日电】在朝鲜政府、朝鲜人民军和当地朝鲜人民的热情帮助下，中国人民志愿军正在积极筹备修建烈士陵园和烈士纪念塔，纪念在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中光荣牺牲的烈士。
    中国人民志愿军司令部、政治部早在今年四月间就向全军发出关于修建烈士陵园和烈士纪念塔的指示，并成立了中国人民志愿军烈士陵园修建委员会，专门指导这项工作的进行。志愿军各部队的领导机关也都成立了烈士陵园修建委员会，在各部队首长的领导下进行筹备工作。
    根据中国人民志愿军烈士陵园修建委员会的决定，在朝鲜牺牲的烈士将根据原掩埋分布情况就地选择地址，适当集中修建烈士陵园，树立墓碑和陵园碑，并在云山、价川、长津湖畔、上甘岭、金城、“老秃山”等著名的战地和其它具有重大纪念意义的地方，修建烈士纪念亭。还决定在开城、元山、新义州三市各修建一座具有永久纪念意义的烈士纪念塔。
    现在，志愿军各部队的烈士陵园修建委员会已初步完成了多种准备工作。修建工作预定在九月份开始。
