    Southwest Region Strengthens Rural Grain Planned Supply Work

    Since the second quarter, grain departments in various parts of the Southwest region have further strengthened the work of planned grain supply in rural areas.

    In recent months, grain departments in various localities have generally conducted a review of the work of planned grain supply in rural areas, and in conjunction with the review, have further publicized the state's grain policy. After the review in Wenhua Township, Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, and the Fourth District of Tongren County, Guizhou Province, the grain supply was appropriately increased based on actual needs. In Longfeng Township, Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, after holding a mass meeting of over a thousand people to further explain the grain policy, the forty-four surplus grain households who had originally requested grain supply not only did not request grain supply but also sold their surplus grain. In order to facilitate grain purchases for grain-deficient farmers, grain departments in many areas implemented the method of supplying grain directly from the warehouses, and some broke administrative divisions to do a good job in grain supply in adjacent areas. In Guizhou Province, grain was supplied directly from warehouses in six thousand one hundred and eighty-five small townships; in the border areas of the Buyi and Miao Autonomous Region of Huishui County and Changshun County, administrative divisions were broken, and the masses were organized to adjust grain, solving the problem of grain supply in remote areas. After the broad masses of farmers understood the state's grain policy and grain-deficient farmers received grain supplied by the state, their production enthusiasm became even higher.

    Under the unified leadership of local Party committees and governments, grain departments in various provinces have actively established primary grain markets under state leadership. According to the latest statistics from the Grain Bureau of the Southwest Administrative Committee, more than three thousand grain markets have been restored and established in the provinces and cities of the Southwest (excluding Xikang Province). In general grain markets in Jiangjin, Nanchong, Luzhou, Yibin, and other special districts of Sichuan Province, there are one to two full-time cadres. After the establishment of these grain markets, they have facilitated the mutual adjustment of grain among farmers, and have powerfully supported the work of planned grain supply in rural areas.

    西南区加强农村粮食计划供应工作
    西南各地粮食部门从第二季度以来，进一步加强了农村粮食计划供应工作。
    各地粮食部门在最近几个月，先后较普遍地对农村粮食计划供应工作进行了复查，结合复查并进一步宣传了国家的粮食政策。四川省内江县文华乡、贵州省铜仁县第四区等复查后，都根据实际需要，适当增加了粮食的供应量。云南省玉溪县龙凤乡召开千余人的群众大会，进一步交代了粮食政策以后，原来一直要求供应粮食的四十四户余粮户，不但不要求供应粮食，还把余粮卖了出来。许多地区的粮食部门为了便利缺粮农民买粮，实行了就仓供应粮食的办法，有的打破行政区划做好了接壤地区的粮食供应工作。贵州省就在六千一百八十五个小乡内实行了就仓供应粮食；惠水县布依族苗族自治区和长顺县接壤地区，打破行政区划，组织群众调剂粮食，解决了边远地区的粮食供应问题。广大农民了解了国家粮食政策，缺粮农民得到了国家供应的粮食以后，生产情绪更加高涨。
    各省粮食部门在当地党委、政府统一领导下，积极建立了国家领导的初级粮食市场。据西南行政委员会粮食局最近的统计，西南各省、市（西康省未统计在内）已恢复和建立三千余个粮食市场。四川省江津、南充、泸州、宜宾等专区一般的粮食市场，都设有一至二个专职干部。这些粮食市场建立以后，便利了农民之间互相调剂粮食，有力地支持了农村粮食计划供应工作。
