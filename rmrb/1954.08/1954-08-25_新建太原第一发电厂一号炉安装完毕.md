    Installation of No. 1 Boiler Completed at the Newly Built Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant
    The No. 1 boiler of the newly built Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant was installed on the 10th of this month. The first hydraulic pressure test showed that the quality of the project was good.
    The No. 1 boiler is the main project of the plant's installation work this year, and the technology is very precise. During the construction, the workers adopted advanced methods of assembling from zero parts and hoisting in batches, and conscientiously implemented the 123 suggestions of the Soviet experts, and made unified balanced scheduling for the boiler installation. Therefore, the quality of the project was guaranteed and the construction progress was accelerated. Workers He Shurong, Zhu Genxi, Li Wenguang and others of the water-cooled wall team took the lead in the operation in shifts, completing the task of their team three days ahead of schedule. With the efforts of all the installation workers, the No. 1 boiler was finally successfully installed after two months of construction.
    After the installation of the No. 1 boiler was completed, Soviet expert Zhibanov immediately led the workers to conduct the first hydraulic pressure test. According to the inspection results of the Soviet boiler experts, the quality of all welded joints was good, without leakage or seepage, which can guarantee safe operation in the future.

    新建太原第一发电厂一号炉安装完毕
    新建太原第一发电厂第一号锅炉已于本月十日安装完毕，经过第一次水压试验，工程质量良好。
    第一号锅炉是该厂今年安装工程的主要工程，技术十分精密。在施工中，职工们采用了由零套整，分批吊装的先进办法，认真贯彻了一百二十三件苏联专家建议，对锅炉安装做了统一平衡调度。因而保证了工程质量，加速了施工进度。水冷壁班何树荣、朱根锡、李文光等工人，分班轮流带头操作，提前三天完成了本班任务。在全体安装工人的努力下，经过两个月的施工，终于把第一号锅炉安装成功了。
    第一号锅炉安装完工后，苏联专家日班诺夫，马上就带领职工进行了第一次水压试验。经过苏联锅炉专家检验结果，全部焊接口质量良好，无漏水和渗水现象，可以保证将来安全运转。
