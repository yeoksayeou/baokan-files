Credit cooperatives in Fujian Province have experienced rapid development. By the end of June, the number of credit cooperatives in the province had increased from 75 at the end of last year to 1,578, and credit mutual aid groups had increased from 1,333 to 5,606. More than two-thirds of the townships in the province now have credit cooperative organizations. There are over 700,000 members of cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and more than a quarter of the farmers in the province have been organized in terms of credit.

These credit cooperative organizations have collected a total of 13 billion yuan in shares and absorbed 16.8 billion yuan in deposits. Through credit business, they have powerfully supported agricultural production and combatted usury. The 140-plus credit cooperatives and credit mutual aid groups in Zhangpu County issued loans totaling 2 billion yuan in the first half of the year, supporting approximately 10,000 farmers in overcoming drought and developing production. The 130 credit cooperatives and 313 credit mutual aid groups in Putian County issued a total of 5.48 billion yuan in loans in the first half of the year, which is 29.8 percent more than the agricultural loans issued by the state bank during the same period. Usury has disappeared in many areas of this county.

The vast number of farmers have personally witnessed the benefits of credit cooperative organizations and are clamoring for the continued establishment of credit cooperatives. Recently, Fujian Province finalized a plan for the development of credit cooperative organizations. By the end of this year, a total of 3,000 credit cooperatives will be established throughout the province, with more than 80 percent of the townships having credit cooperative organizations, and the participating farmers will account for more than 45 percent of the total number of farmers in the province.

    信用合作组织迅速发展
    福建省的信用合作组织有了迅速的发展。到六月底止，全省的信用合作社已经由去年年底的七十五个发展到一千五百七十八个，信用互助组由一千三百三十三个发展到五千六百零六个。全省三分之二以上的乡已经有了信用合作组织。社员和组员共有七十多万人，全省四分之一以上的农户已经在信贷方面组织起来。
    这些信用合作组织共收集股金一百三十多亿元，吸收存款一百六十八亿元。它们通过信贷业务，有力地支持了农业生产，打击了高利贷活动。漳浦县一百四十多个信用合作社和信用互助组，在上半年发放贷款二十亿元，支持大约一万户农民战胜了干旱，发展了生产。莆田县一百三十个信用合作社和三百一十三个信用互助组，上半年共发放贷款五十四亿八千多万元，比同一时期国家银行发放的农业贷款多百分之二十九点八。这个县不少地区的高利贷活动已经绝迹。
    广大农民亲眼看到了信用合作组织的好处，纷纷要求继续建立信用合作社。最近，福建省确定了发展信用合作组织的计划。到今年年底以前，全省将一共建立起三千个信用合作社，将有百分之八十以上的乡有信用合作组织，参加的农户将占全省总农户的百分之四十五以上。
