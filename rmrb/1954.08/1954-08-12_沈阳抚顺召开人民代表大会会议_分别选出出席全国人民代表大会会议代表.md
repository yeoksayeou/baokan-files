【Benbao Shenyang, Eleventh Electric】The first session of the First People's Congress of Shenyang City was held from August 9th to 11th. A total of 432 representatives attended the meeting.

    The meeting listened to and reviewed the report on the work of the first half of 1954 and the current important tasks made by Zhang Like, Deputy Mayor of Shenyang, on behalf of the Municipal People's Government. The report pointed out that 1954 is the second year of China's first five-year construction plan, and under the leadership of the Central Government, the people of Shenyang have basically completed various tasks in the first half of the year.

Regarding the current work, the report proposes that in the future, we should continue to do a good job in various tasks such as industry, capital construction, culture, education, and health, and effectively improve government work, further strengthen ties with the masses, so as to ensure the completion or over-fulfillment of various tasks in 1954.

Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, Eleventh Electric: The first session of the First People's Congress of Fushun City was held from August 8th to 10th. A total of 257 representatives attended the meeting.

    At the meeting, Zhang Shu, Mayor of Fushun, delivered a report to the representatives on the current work, and Du Li, First Deputy Secretary of the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, also attended the meeting and gave a speech. Zhang Shu pointed out in the report that Fushun's production and construction in 1954 will continue to develop steadily along with the development of national economic construction. The key projects being constructed in Fushun have already begun design and construction; the exploration and design work for the large-scale coal mine construction is underway; and other reconstruction and expansion projects are also actively underway. By the end of June, the city had completed 49.3 percent of the annual basic construction plan, with generally good project quality, and some projects have been completed and put into production; the total output value of state-owned and local state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in the city completed 106.4 percent of the plan for the first half of the year and 51.71 percent of the annual industrial production plan.

    After the representatives seriously discussed and reviewed Zhang Shu's report, they unanimously agreed and pointed out that all employees and people in Fushun should redouble their efforts and work together with the people of the whole country to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and resolutely strive for the complete reunification of the motherland and the complete victory of the people's liberation cause.
