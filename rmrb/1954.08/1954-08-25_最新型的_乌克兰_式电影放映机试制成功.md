    Newest “Ukrainian” Style Film Projector Successfully Trial-Produced
    The state-owned Nanjing Film Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced China's first batch of the newest "Ukrainian" style film projectors on August 15th.
    The "Ukrainian" style projector has many advantages over ordinary projectors. For example, the sound is loud, the picture is bright, and the audience sitting in the front row can see clearly. Especially when projecting color films, the picture is clearer and brighter than ordinary projectors, making it most suitable for use in rural areas, factories, and the military. When projecting outdoors, the "Ukrainian" style projector can accommodate an audience of more than 1,000 people, double the number of viewers compared to the "200" style projector previously manufactured by the factory.
    The technical requirements for the "Ukrainian" style film projector are very high. With a spirit of innovation, the workers overcame the difficulties of insufficient technical strength, low technical level, and short time during the trial production process. They used the method of learning while doing and helping each other, and finally completed the trial production task of ten projectors on schedule on August 15th.
    Now the factory's employees are summarizing their work in order to learn from experience and prepare for the arrival of mass production tasks to meet the needs of the people's cultural life. (Report from our Jiangsu reporter station)

    最新型的“乌克兰”式电影放映机试制成功
    国营南京电影机械厂在八月十五日试制成功了我国第一批最新型的“乌克兰”式电影放映机。
    “乌克兰”式放映机比一般放映机具有很多优点。像发音响亮，画面光线充足，放映时坐在前排的观众也能看得很清楚，特别是在放映彩色片时，画面更比一般放映机清晰、鲜明，最适合农村、工厂、部队使用。在室外放映时，“乌克兰”式放映机能供一千人以上观众观看，比该厂过去制造的“二零零”式放映机增加一倍观众。
    “乌克兰”式电影放映机的技术要求很高，工人们以革新精神，克服了试制过程中技术力量不足，技术水平不高，以及时间短的困难。他们用边学、边做，互相帮助的办法，终于在八月十五日按期完成了十台放映机的试制任务。
    现在该厂职工正在总结工作，以便吸取经验，迎接大批生产任务的到来，满足人民文化生活的需要。　　　　　　　（本报江苏记者站）
