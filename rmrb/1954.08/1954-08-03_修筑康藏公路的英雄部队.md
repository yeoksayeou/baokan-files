    The People's Liberation Army troops building the road on the roof of the world are pushing the Kangding-Tibet Highway forward with earth-shattering heroic labor. Now, the highway has been extended more than 900 kilometers westward. Riding a horse to travel this distance would take more than twenty days to a month. The soldiers, with their own hands, paved the road together with the road construction workers. The amount of earth and stone they excavated in the past two years alone, if used in the Huai River control project, could add a dam five meters high, five meters wide, and more than three hundred li long to the Huai River.

    For more than two years, the soldiers, from the windy spring to the snowy winter, cleaved one mountain and climbed another peak, dismantling their tents again and again from high mountains four to five thousand meters above sea level, and re-erecting them in river valleys or forests. Thousands of steel drills became blunt in their hands, and the shovels were worn as wide as sickles. However, the soldiers' iron will made the nine high mountains above four thousand meters above sea level bow to them, and tamed countless rapids under their feet.

    When working on the banks of the Nujiang River and under the Tanggula Mountains, because the construction site was steep and dangerous, it was impossible to fully deploy all manpower. At night, the soldiers lit branches and worked in shifts for dozens of days and nights continuously. On some construction sites, it was so steep that there was no place to light a fire for illumination, so they tied a white cloth to the steel drill as a marker, or used a flashlight to illuminate it. The construction site of the third platoon of a certain company was a steep cliff forty meters high, and it was difficult to climb to the top to tie the safety rope. The soldiers used the method of building a human pyramid, with people carrying people to open up a foothold. Assault troops climbed to the top of the cliff with difficulty and lowered the first rope. Then, a heavy snowstorm descended, and if the hammer did not hit the steel drill for a while, the steel drill would freeze in the gun eye. One night, a strong wind swept down with heavy snow, and the weather was so cold that saliva quickly froze into ice when spat on the ground. However, the soldiers working on the cliff were sweating all over. They sang in the wind and snow: "Snowflakes are falling, sweat is flowing, we have changed the barren mountains." At that time, the soldiers of the eighth company of a certain unit also collectively created a poem: "The wind is cold, but our hearts are warm, and hot blood can overcome ice and snow." During the rainy season construction, the soldiers were covered in mud every day, and at this time they were most happy to sing such a fast-paced song: "Raindrops, as big as soybeans, hit the leaves with a crash. We can blow down the mountains, what's a little rain!" The winter before last, it often snowed on Que'er Mountain. After several days of heavy snow, the snow on the road was more than one meter thick. The soldiers of a certain company, who were tasked with sweeping the snow, cleared the snow in the severe cold of about minus thirty degrees. They went up the mountain every day after breakfast and didn't come down for dinner until dark. At that time, model Youth League member Li Xuewen proposed to all the Youth League members of the company the slogan "Youth League members will not go down the mountain until the snow on the Que'er Mountain road is cleared," and he was the first to climb the peak of Que'er Mountain. Under his influence, the work efficiency of the whole company in sweeping snow increased five times.

    In this march to conquer nature, a large number of heroic figures have emerged in the army, and 6,083 people have been rated as people's heroes at all levels. Such as the exploration hero Cui Ximing, first-class meritorious person Luo Shaozhou, and the creator of the mountain-shaped excavation method, special-class meritorious person Gao Fuyin, etc., are already well-known figures in the country. Their deeds have been adapted into scripts by literary and art workers and performed many times in the road construction troops. In the film "Conquering the Nujiang River," the photographer also used close-up shots to film their heroic images. Song Wenyi, the squad leader of a certain company, was called the "leader" in overcoming difficulties by the soldiers. He led the soldiers to improve the operation method in stone work, which made the work efficiency of the entire platoon in opening stone quarries more than twenty times the quota. Cadres and soldiers have also improved and created dozens of mature operation methods, saving a large amount of wealth for the country.

    In the road construction troops, there are also hundreds and thousands of model logistics workers and office workers. Under the slogan of doing everything to build the Kangding-Tibet Highway well, they worked day and night, creating various miracles in their work. The cooks can make dozens of kinds of dishes with soybeans, and they can even grow bean sprouts in the severe cold mountains in winter. Zheng Kui Rong, an mimeographer of a certain unit and a first-class meritorious person, printed more than 4 million documents and engraved more than 2 million words in one year. When a certain section was under intensive construction, in order to transmit the construction experience to the troops in time, Zheng Kui Rong often stayed up late to engrave documents, and his eyes were red. Sometimes, his hands were so frozen that he couldn't hold the stylus firmly. At this time, he asked himself: "Can't you endure this little bit of hardship during the construction of the motherland?" So, he mustered up his courage and continued to work.

    The soldiers on the Kangding-Tibet Plateau have been working hard to build the Kangding-Tibet Highway like this for years.

    修筑康藏公路的英雄部队
    新华社记者　陈家璡
    在世界屋脊上筑路的人民解放军部队，用排山倒海的英雄式的劳动，把康藏公路不断地向前推进。现在，公路已经向西伸长了九百多公里。骑着马走这段路程，也需要二十多天到一个月。战士们就凭着他们的双手，和筑路工人一起铺平了公路。光是他们在去年和前年挖的土方、石方，如果用到治淮工程上，可以给淮河再增加一道高五公尺，宽五公尺，长三百多华里的拦水坝。
    两年多来，战士们从卷着大风的春天到冰雪封山的冬天，劈开了这一座山，又登上另一个高峰，一次又一次地从拔海四五千公尺的高山上拆掉帐篷，在河谷上或森林里再架设起来。千万根钢钎在他们的手下磨秃了，铁锹磨得像镰刀一样宽。但是，战士们的钢铁意志，却使拦路的九座拔海四千公尺以上的大山向他们低了头，使无数条急流驯服在脚下。
    在怒江两岸和唐古喇山下施工时，因为工地陡险，无法把人力全部展开，夜里战士们点着树枝，一连几十昼夜地轮班工作。有些工地上，陡得连燃火照明的地方都没有，他们就在钢钎上拴一块白布作记号，或者用手电筒照亮。某连第三排的工地是一处高四十公尺的陡崖，爬到顶上拴保险绳都很困难。战士们采用叠罗汉的办法，人驮着人开出了立脚点。突击手们艰难地爬上崖顶，吊下了第一根绳子。接着，大风雪就降临了，铁锤一会不打到钢钎上，钢钎就会冻结在炮眼里。一天夜里，狂风卷着大雪扑下来，天气冷得口水吐到地上很快就结成冰。但是在悬崖上工作的战士们却浑身发热。他们在风雪里唱着：“雪花飘，汗水淌，我们把荒山变了样。”当时，某部第八连的战士们还集体创作了一首诗：“风冷我们心里热，热血可以胜冰雪。”在雨季施工时，战士们身上天天沾满了泥水，这时他们最欢喜唱这样一首快板：“雨点子，黄豆大，打得树叶哗啦啦。大山我们能炸倒，下点小雨算个啥！”前年冬天，雀儿山上常落雪。一连几天大雪之后，公路上的积雪有一公尺多厚。担任扫雪任务的某连战士们，冒着零下三十度左右的严寒扫除积雪。每天吃过早饭上山，天黑才下山吃饭。当时模范青年团员李学文向全连青年团员提出“不扫完雀儿山路上的雪，青年团员不下山”的口号，他首先爬上雀儿山的高峰。在他的影响下，全连扫雪的工作效率提高了五倍。
    在这项征服大自然的进军中，部队中涌现了大批英雄人物，已有六千零八十三人被评为各级人民功臣。如探险英雄崔锡明、一等功臣罗绍洲和山字形挖土法的创造者、特等功臣高福印等，已是全国知名的人物了。他们的事迹，被文艺工作者编成剧本，多次在筑路部队中演出。在“战胜怒江天险”的影片里，摄影师也用特写镜头拍摄了他们的英雄形象。某连班长宋文义，被战士们称为战胜困难的“领队人”，他带领战士改进了石方作业中的操作方法，曾使全排开石方的工作效率超过定额二十多倍。干部、战士们还改进和创造了几十种成熟的操作方法，为国家节省了大批财富。
    筑路部队中，还有成百上千的模范后勤工作者和机关工作者。在一切为了修好康藏公路的口号下，他们夜以继日地工作着，创造了各种工作上的奇迹。炊事人员能用黄豆做出几十种花样的菜来，就是在冬天严寒的高山上，也能生出豆芽。某部油印员、一等功臣郑奎荣，一年内曾印出四百多万份文件，刻写了二百多万字。当某段突击施工时，为了及时把施工经验传达给部队，郑奎荣经常熬夜刻写文件，两只眼睛都熬红了。有时，他的手冻得铁笔都拿不紧。这时候他就问自己：“在祖国建设的时候，这点苦就不能吃吗？”于是，他再一次鼓起勇气干下去。
    在康藏高原上的战士们，就是这样几年如一日地辛劳地修筑着康藏公路。
