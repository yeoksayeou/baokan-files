Shanxi Province attaches importance to giving play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine, and has achieved certain results in carrying forward the academic heritage of Chinese medicine and meeting the health needs of the people.

At present, Shanxi Province has set up a sanatorium of traditional Chinese medicine with 70 beds, and one each of traditional Chinese medicine outpatient department and acupuncture department. Shanxi Provincial Cadre Medical Hospital, Taiyuan First Public Medical Outpatient Department, Yuci Hospital, Xin County Hospital, and Linfen Hospital are equipped with traditional Chinese medicine outpatient clinics and acupuncture clinics; most other county health centers and clinics are equipped with traditional Chinese medicine departments. In addition, many factories and mines, such as Heavy Machinery Factory, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, and Shanxi Chemical Factory, have traditional Chinese medicine practitioners responsible for treatment tasks. The newly built Provincial Hospital will also employ traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and add a larger Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Shanxi Provincial School of Advanced Studies in Traditional Chinese Medicine is also preparing to establish an outpatient department, which will be responsible for outpatient treatment and internships for students, and will also be responsible for organizing academic research work of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in the province.

In the past four years, Shanxi Province has focused on promoting acupuncture therapy in the promotion of academic experience of traditional Chinese medicine, which has attracted the attention of Western medicine. For example, the Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi Medical College hired more than ten famous traditional Chinese medicine practitioners this spring to give reports on acupuncture theory and introduce clinical experience to the hospital's medical staff in turn. Health centers, clinics, and general hospitals throughout the province have generally promoted or adopted acupuncture therapy. More than 50 Western medicine practitioners in the Provincial Engineering Company have also paid attention to adopting acupuncture therapy. Taiyuan Health Technology School and Changzhi Health Technology School have also set up acupuncture courses. In addition, the provincial leadership has also conducted research and promotion of clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine through various methods such as symposiums of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and advanced studies of traditional Chinese medicine. Last November, more than 30 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Ji County exchanged more than 200 kinds of ancestral secret recipes. The Taiyuan Health Workers Association invited traditional Chinese medicine practitioners Li Hanqing and Yuan Zihe to give eight lectures on academic experience of traditional Chinese medicine in the first half of this year; traditional Chinese medicine practitioners Wang Zhixuan and Han Yuhui also gave reports on gynecology, cirrhosis, ascites, dry pleurisy, pneumonia, and intestinal bleeding to 120 students of the Provincial School of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

The result of attaching importance to the role of traditional Chinese medicine and promoting academic experience of traditional Chinese medicine has effectively strengthened health care and is welcomed by the broad masses of working people. For example, in Shanxi Provincial Government Cadre Public Medical Hospital, from March to December last year, acupuncture treatment of 12 patients with facial paralysis had a cure rate of more than 90%; acupuncture treatment of 33 patients with trigeminal neuralgia also had a cure rate of more than 80%; the number of outpatient visits to the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory sometimes almost reached 40% of the total number of outpatient visits.

    山西省普遍重视发挥中医作用
    山西省重视发挥中医作用，在发扬祖国医药学术遗产、适应人民保健需要方面，已取得一定成绩。
    目前，山西省已专门设置包括七十个床位的中医疗养院一所，中医门诊部、针灸部各一所。山西省级干部医疗院、太原市立第一公费医疗门诊部、榆次医院、忻县医院、临汾医院均设有中医门诊、针灸门诊；其他大部县卫生院、卫生所均设有中医部。此外，不少厂矿，如重型机器厂、太原矿山机器厂、山西化学厂等均有中医担任治疗任务。还有新建的省立医院也将延聘中医，增设规模较大的中医科。山西省中医进修学校也正在筹建门诊部，除负责门诊治疗及供学员实习外，还将负责组织全省中医进行学术研究工作。
    过去四年中，山西省在中医学术经验的推广工作上，首先是着重针灸疗法的推广，已引起了西医的重视。如山西医学院附属医院今年春季曾聘请十余名著名中医，轮流向全院医务人员作过针灸理论的报告和临床经验介绍。全省卫生院、卫生所及综合医院均已普遍推广或采用了针灸疗法。省工程公司五十余名西医也都注意采用了针灸疗法。太原卫生技术学校、长治卫生技术学校还专设了针灸课程。此外，省的领导上还通过中西医座谈会、中医进修等各种方式，进行中医临床经验的研究和推广。去年十一月，吉县三十多个中医交流了二百多种祖传秘方。太原市卫生工作者协会今年上半年中曾请中医李汉卿、元子和等开过八次有关中医学术经验的讲座；中医王稚轩、韩玉辉还对省中医学校一百二十名学员作了关于妇科、肝硬化、腹水、干性肋膜炎、肺炎及肠出血等临床经验的报告。
    重视发挥中医作用和推广中医学术经验的结果，已有效地加强了卫生保健事业，受到广大劳动人民的欢迎。如山西省级机关干部公费医疗院，去年三至十二月经过针灸治疗颜面神经麻痹的十二人，治愈率达到百分之九十以上；三叉神经痛针灸三十三人，治愈率也达到百分之八十以上；太原矿山机器厂中医门诊数有时几乎达到全体病人门诊数的百分之四十。（倪合一）
