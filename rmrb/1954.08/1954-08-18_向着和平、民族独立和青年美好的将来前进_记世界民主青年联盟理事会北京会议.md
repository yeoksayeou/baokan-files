    Moving Towards Peace, National Independence, and a Bright Future for Youth
    —A Record of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council Meeting in Beijing
    Feng Zhidan
    The Council meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth was held in Beijing from August 9th to 15th.

    Two hundred and sixty-three youth representatives and guests from sixty-eight countries attended this grand meeting. These young friends came from all corners of the world. They came from the Amazon River, hidden by virgin tropical forests; they came from the Nile and Ganges rivers, cradles of ancient cultures; they came from the beautiful Rhine and the blue Danube; they came from the magnificent Volga...

    They held different political views, religious beliefs, ethnicities, and languages, but they all shared the common aspirations of hundreds of millions of young people around the world, fighting for peace, national independence, and a bright future for youth.

    In the past year, youth from various countries, together with people all over the world, have made tremendous contributions to this noble goal. The meeting featured the outstanding Spanish anti-fascist fighter, Raimundo, leader of the Spanish Youth Movement, who was imprisoned in March 1951 for leading a strike of 300,000 workers in Barcelona against the Franco fascist regime. Prisons and fascist secret agents tortured Raimundo's youth, but the huge wave of protests from around the world finally restored his freedom. During the meeting, a telegram arrived from Amsterdam stating that a Dutch youth soldier, Piet Van Stuvel, who refused to fight against the Indonesian people, had been released after five years of imprisonment. At the meeting, the names of the outstanding French youth peace fighters, Henri Martin and Raymond Dien, were mentioned more than once. They have become shining banners for French youth in the movement to end the colonial war in Indochina.

    It is they, it is these famous or countless unsung heroes, who have made great achievements for the cause of peace for all mankind. People remember that a year ago, at the 3rd World Youth Congress in Bucharest, when the Chinese delegation announced the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, how ecstatic the representatives of young people from various countries participating in the meeting were. They lifted the Chinese and Korean representatives high and cheered for this victory of all mankind. Now, the Indochina War has ended, and the wishes of the Indochinese people for peace, independence, and unity have been respected, further easing international tensions. This is another great victory for all mankind.

    French youth representative Roland Gache said excitedly at the meeting: "Today, we step onto this podium with joy and hope. For seven years, we have met our Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian friends at international conferences more than once. Each time, we felt very uncomfortable, our eyes filled with tears, we all had the same ideals, the same worries, the same hopes... We fought... Now our hearts are beating, and we can't speak, because we can hardly control our joyful mood, and finally be able to say: the guns have stopped, and today a great road to rebuild peace in Indochina has been opened... ending the nightmares of countless young people, countless mothers, and countless fiancées."

    The victory of the Indochinese people has brought infinite encouragement to the youth still under colonial oppression. Mamani Abdul, a youth representative from Nigeria in Africa, brought a wrinkled photograph from his motherland and gave it to the Vietnamese representative. This is a photograph of the Nigerian people holding a demonstration on "May Day" this year demanding an end to the Indochina War. This upright black youth wrote on the back of the photo: "Vietnamese brothers, we greatly admire the heroic spirit of the Vietnamese people and youth in the struggle for peace and national independence." An Algerian representative said to the Vietnamese representative: "Your victory is our victory." A representative from Malaya met with the Vietnamese representative during a break in the meeting. They did not understand each other's languages, but they held hands tightly, passionately expressing their friendly enthusiasm. Hu Zhu, head of the Vietnamese delegation, told reporters: "This kind of feeling is like that between brothers and sisters. We are all convinced that: the Vietnam of today is the Nigeria, Algeria, and Malaya of tomorrow."

    Indeed, the noble struggle of young people all over the world for peace, national independence, and a bright future for youth has achieved great victories. However, this struggle still has a long and arduous road ahead. As Benini, the outstanding fighter of the world youth movement and Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, pointed out in his report: "Today, millions of young people still live in the inhuman situation of being enslaved by colonialists. Almost half of the world's population (44 percent) lives in colonies and dependent countries."

    Sixty-five youth representatives from fifty-five countries expressed their opinions on Benini's report at the conference. They deeply realized that without national independence, it is impossible to guarantee the vital rights of young people.

    The speeches of representatives from colonial dependent countries presented a picture: under cruel colonial oppression, the beautiful youth of young people are buried in the bitter sea of hunger, poverty, disease, and enslavement.

    Young people in colonial dependent countries are deprived of the most basic political rights. In Algeria, Arabic is regarded as a "foreign language," and colonial criminal law stipulates that singing folk songs is punishable by imprisonment. In Algeria, colonial authorities carried out 890 arrests of local residents within a year, sentencing them to 825 years of imprisonment, 185 years of exile, and more than 1,200 years of deprivation of "civil rights." Black people in South Africa must carry seventeen types of identification documents with them, and missing one could lead to arrest. University students in Malaya are not allowed to discuss the well-known fact that the United States is interfering in the Indochina War in student newspapers; teachers in Japan are not allowed to talk about social affairs in classrooms. In all these countries, the activities of trade unions, mass organizations, and democratic parties are stifled and suppressed.

    Young people all over the world are increasingly clearly seeing that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious colonialist today. Almost every colony and backward country suffers from the plunder and exploitation of U.S. monopoly capital; wherever there is a national independence movement, there are U.S. weapons and money used to suppress and massacre the people.

    People can hear the iron hooves of U.S. invading troops on the territories of sixty-three countries. U.S. armed forces occupy the territory of the Republic of Iceland. The Icelandic youth representative said: "We have lost our sovereignty." A strong U.S. fleet appeared on the surface of Rio de Janeiro's sea, and U.S. military missions appeared in this Brazilian capital. The Brazilian youth representative said: "Brazil is re-entering the process of colonization."

    Despite differences in political ideologies and religious beliefs, it is entirely possible for all young people to reach a consensus in discussing common issues. Mahmoud Abu Sand, a youth representative of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, said that he was "fighting to realize the ideals of Islam," but he also believed that colonialism is "a disgrace to our century," and that "Egyptian youth hope that their country can coexist peacefully with other countries in the world in accordance with their own ideals and internal desire for peace." Suzuki Juro, a Japanese representative from the Liaison Council of Conservative Japanese Youth Groups, attended the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council meeting for the first time. He called out: "Let's not allow anyone to talk for a moment about the cruel hydrogen bomb war that can slaughter hundreds of millions of innocent people!" The Japanese people have suffered three atomic weapons disasters.

    In order to widely mobilize the great new force of rural youth to participate in the struggle for peace, national independence, and the vital rights of youth, the meeting also warmly discussed the issue of holding an International Rural Youth Conference, initiated by the rural youth of Sant'Alberto, Ravenna Province, Italy. Jacques Denis, Secretary General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, gave a moving report on this agenda item, which was unanimously supported by all the representatives. Quoting the words of the Italian representative from the initiating country is most appropriate, he said: "Let us move forward consciously and with confidence, those who sow wheat will surely defeat those who sow death and war!"

    The meeting also accepted the invitation of the heroic Polish youth, and young people from various countries will go to Warsaw, the capital of the People's Republic of Poland, a city of heroes, at the end of July next year to celebrate the festival of world youth friendship and unity - the 5th World Youth and Student Festival.

    There should be no discrimination and hatred among young people, and there is no such thing at all. Those who participated in the meeting personally felt the friendship, harmony, and unity that permeated the entire process of the meeting.

    This kind of emotion was not only present between the youth of colonial dependent countries, but also between the youth of those colonial powers and colonial dependent countries. At the meeting, U.S. and Korean youth representatives; British and Malayan youth representatives; Dutch and Indonesian youth representatives; French and Indochinese youth representatives, they embraced, shook hands, and kissed passionately again and again, how unforgettable this is!

    Youth representatives from the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries warmly expressed their eternal solidarity with the youth of colonial dependent countries. Soviet representative Romanovsky said: "The youth of our multinational country are faithful to the belief of peace and friendship between all peoples. These young people have always supported and will continue to support the just demands of young men and women in colonial dependent countries."

    Chinese representative Liu Daosheng also said: "Chinese youth will always be faithful to the cause of promoting peace and friendship among young people of all countries, and will always be the faithful and reliable friends of all oppressed nations."

    On the afternoon of August 15th, the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council meeting in Beijing successfully closed. After 297 free speeches and full democratic consultations at the plenary meeting and working group committees, all the representatives attending the meeting unanimously adopted resolutions and a declaration on the three agenda items, which once again reflected the great unity of young people all over the world.

    At the closing ceremony of the meeting, the presidium solemnly announced that the ranks of the World Federation of Democratic Youth had grown unprecedentedly. The Council welcomed twenty-four new member organizations from seventeen countries to join the great ranks of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Among these countries, there were five countries that had no youth organizations participating in the World Federation of Democratic Youth in the past. And due to the participation of Portuguese youth organizations, the World Federation of Democratic Youth now has member organizations in all European countries. This means that the ranks of the World Federation of Democratic Youth now have 85 million young peace fighters from ninety-seven countries.

    Everyone firmly believes that after the Beijing meeting, young people all over the world will raise the banner of striving for peace, national independence, and a bright future for youth even higher, unite more strongly, and move towards the sacred cause of mankind!

    向着和平、民族独立和青年美好的将来前进
    ——记世界民主青年联盟理事会北京会议
    冯之丹
    八月九日到十五日，世界民主青年联盟理事会在北京举行了会议。
    六十八个国家的二百六十三位青年代表和来宾参加了这个盛大的会议。这些青年朋友们来自全世界的各个角落。他们是从被原始热带林所掩盖的亚马逊河上来的；他们是从孕育了古文化的尼罗河和恒河上来的；他们是从美丽的莱因河和蓝色的多瑙河上来的；他们是从壮阔的伏尔加河上来的……
    他们有着不同的政治见解、宗教信仰、种族和语言，但他们都怀着全世界亿万青年的共同愿望，为了和平、民族独立和青年美好的将来而斗争。
    在过去一年的日子里，各国青年和全世界人民一道已经为了这个崇高的目标作出了巨大的贡献。会场上出现了杰出的西班牙反法西斯战士，西班牙青年运动领袖雷蒙多，他在一九五一年三月由于领导三十万巴塞罗那的工人进行反抗佛朗哥法西斯统治的大罢工而被捕入狱，监狱和法西斯特务用酷刑来折磨雷蒙多的青春，但是全世界抗议的巨大声浪终于使他恢复了自由。会议中，从阿姆斯特丹拍来了电报说，一个拒绝向印度尼西亚人民作战的荷兰青年士兵派提·万·斯妥维尔在被囚禁了五年之后又恢复自由了。会议上，人们不止一次地提到法兰西的杰出的青年和平斗士亨利·马丁和雷蒙德·第安的名字。他们已经成为法国青年在争取结束印度支那殖民战争的运动中的光辉旗帜。
    正是他们，正是这些有名或者数不尽的无名英雄们，使全人类的和平事业有了巨大的收获。人们记得，一年以前，在世界青年第三届代表大会布加勒斯特会议上，当中国代表宣布朝鲜停战协定签字时，参加会议的各国青年的代表是如何地欣喜若狂，他们把中国代表和朝鲜代表高高地举起来，欢呼这次全人类的胜利。而现在印度支那战争停止了，印度支那人民的和平、独立与统一的愿望得到了尊重，从而使国际紧张气氛有了进一步的缓和，这是全人类的又一次伟大胜利。
    法国青年代表罗兰奇在会上激动地说道：“今天，我们带着欢欣和希望走上这个讲坛。七年以来，我们曾不止一次地和我们的越南、寮国和高棉的朋友们在国际会议上相遇。每一次，我们总是很难受，眼睛里充满着热泪，我们彼此都有同样的理想，同样的忧虑，同样的希望……。我们进行了斗争……。现在我们的心在跳，话也说不出来，因为我们几乎难以控制我们愉快的心情，而终于能够这样说：炮声停止了，今天已展开了一条重建印度支那和平的大道……结束了无数青年，无数母亲和无数未婚妻的噩梦”。
    印度支那人民的胜利，给那些仍然处在殖民主义压迫下的青年带来了无限鼓舞的力量。来自非洲尼日利亚青年代表马曼尼·阿卜杜勒从他的祖国带来了一张有着折纹的照片，送给越南代表。这是今年“五一”节尼日利亚人民举行要求停止印度支那战争的游行示威的照片。这个正直的黑种青年在相片背后写道：“越南兄弟，我们非常钦佩越南人民和青年在为和平与民族独立斗争中的英雄气概”。一个阿尔及利亚的代表对越南代表说：“你们的胜利也就是我们的胜利”。马来亚的一位代表和越南代表在会议休息时会见了，他们彼此语言不通，但是他们紧紧地握住手，激动地流露着友爱的热情。越南代表团团长胡竹告诉记者说：“这种感情像是同胞兄弟一样。我们都确信：越南人民的今天，也就是尼日利亚、阿尔及利亚、马来亚兄弟的明天”。
    的确，全世界青年为和平、民族独立与青年的美好将来而进行的崇高斗争已取得了巨大的胜利成果，然而，这个斗争还有着悠长和艰巨的路程。正如世界青年运动杰出的战士、世界青联主席柏尼尼在他的报告中指出的：“今天千百万青年还生活在被殖民主义者奴役的非人道的境地。地球上几乎半数的人口（占百分之四十四）生活在殖民地和附属国中”。
    五十五个国家的六十五个青年代表在大会上就柏尼尼的报告发表了意见，他们深刻地体会到，没有民族独立就不可能保证青年的切身权利。
    殖民地附属国家代表的发言在人们眼前展现着这样一幅景象：在残酷的殖民压迫下，青年们的美好的青春被埋葬在饥饿、贫困、疾病和奴役的苦海中。
    殖民地附属国家的青年被剥夺了最基本的政治权利。在阿尔及利亚，阿拉伯语被当作“外国语”，殖民者的刑法规定唱民歌就要被判徒刑，一年内在阿尔及利亚殖民当局对当地居民进行了八百九十次逮捕，判处了八百二十五年徒刑，一百八十五年流放，一千二百多年的剥夺“公民权”。南非洲的黑种人随身必须携带十七种证明文件，少了一份就有可能遭到逮捕。马来亚的大学生不准在学生报上论述美国干涉印度支那战争的众所周知的事实；日本的教师不准在课室里谈论社会事务。在所有这些国家里，工会、群众团体和民主政党的活动遭到窒息和镇压。
    全世界的青年都愈来愈清楚地看到了，美帝国主义是今天最凶恶的殖民主义者。几乎没有一个殖民地和落后国家不遭受到美国垄断资本的掠夺和剥削；那里有民族独立运动，那里就有用来镇压和屠杀人民的美国武器和金元。
    人们可以从六十三个国家领土上，听到美国侵略部队的铁蹄声。美国武装部队占领了冰岛共和国的领土，冰岛青年代表说：“我们丧失了我们的主权”。美国的一支强大的舰队出现在里约热内卢的海面，美国的军事使团出现在这个巴西的首都，巴西青年代表说：“巴西正在重新进入了殖民地化的过程”。
    尽管有政治思想与宗教信仰等的不同，也完全可以使所有的年青人在讨论共同的问题中求得一致的意见。埃及回教兄弟会的青年代表马茂德·阿布·桑德说他是“为了实现回教的理想而斗争”，但他也认为殖民主义“对我们的世纪说来，是一种耻辱”，“埃及青年希望他们的国家能够按照他们自己的理想和内在的和平愿望和世界上其他国家和平共处”。日本的铃木重郎代表保守的日本青年团体联络协议会，第一次列席世界青联理事会会议，他呼吁：“不要允许任何人谈论片刻即可屠杀亿万无辜人民的残酷的氢弹战争吧！”日本人民已遭到三次原子武器的灾害了。
    为了广泛地发动农村青年这支伟大的生力军参加到为和平、民族独立与青年切身权利的斗争里来，这次会议还热烈地讨论了意大利拉温那省圣塔尔贝托农村青年倡议的召开国际农村青年大会问题。世界青联总书记雅克·德尼关于这一议程的动人的报告受到全体代表的一致拥护。这里引用倡议国意大利代表的话是再也恰当不过的，他说：“让我们自觉地、满怀信心地前进吧，散播麦种的人一定能够战胜散播死亡和战争的人的！”
    会议并接受了英勇的波兰青年的邀请，各国青年在明年的七月底到波兰人民共和国的首都、英雄城华沙去欢度世界青年友谊与团结的节日——第五届世界青年与学生联欢节。
    年青人中间本来就不应该，也根本不存在任何歧视和仇恨，参加会议的人都亲身感受到了会议的整个过程中充溢着的友谊、和谐和团结。
    不仅是在殖民地附属国家的青年之间，而且在那些宗主国与殖民地附属国家的青年之间也都充满着这种感情。会场上，美国和朝鲜青年代表；英国和马来亚的青年代表；荷兰和印尼的青年代表；法国和印度支那的青年代表，他们一次又一次地热情地拥抱、握手和接吻，这是多么地令人难忘呵！
    苏联、中国和人民民主国家的青年代表，热情地表示永远和殖民地附属国的青年站在一起。苏联代表罗马诺夫斯基说：“我们多民族国家的青年是忠实于和平与各国人民之间友谊这一信念的，这些青年始终支持，今后仍将支持殖民地附属国家青年男女的正义要求”。
    中国代表刘导生也说：“中国青年永远忠实于促进各国青年和平友谊的事业，永远是一切被压迫民族忠实可靠的朋友”。
  八月十五日下午，世界青联理事会北京会议圆满地闭幕了。出席会议的全体代表在经过大会和工作小组委员会上二百九十七次的自由发言和充分进行民主协商之后，一致通过了关于三项议程的决议和一项宣言，这就再一次地反映了全世界青年的伟大的团结。
    会议的闭幕式上，会议主席团隆重地宣布，世界青联的队伍空前地壮大了。理事会欢迎了十七个国家的二十四个组织的新盟员参加世界青联的伟大的行列。在这些国家中，有五个国家过去是没有任何青年组织参加世界青联的。而由于葡萄牙青年组织的参加，现在世界青联在所有欧洲的国家中都有了会员组织了。这也就是说，在世界青联的队伍里从此拥有了九十七个国家的八千五百万青年和平战士了。
  谁都坚定地相信：在北京会议之后，全世界青年将要更高地举起争取和平、民族独立与争取青年美好将来的大旗，更坚强地团结起来，向着人类神圣的事业迈进！
