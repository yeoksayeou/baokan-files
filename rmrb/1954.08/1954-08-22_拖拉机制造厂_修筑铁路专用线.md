    Tractor Factory
    Building Railway Spur Line
    The railway spur line of China's first tractor factory is under construction, and the pale yellow roadbed has already emerged from the ground. Railway workers constructing the spur line, in order to support the tractor factory, are transporting ballast, sleepers, and rails in the rain, working intensely to lay tracks on the roadbed, striving to complete the entire line by the end of this year. They started work on July 20th this year, and by August 18th, they had laid two and a half kilometers of track. Now, light vehicles can use the completed track to carry road-building materials. At the end of August, a new iron bridge more than 140 meters long will be built on the spur line. After this railway spur line is completed, it will connect the tractor factory with the railway trunk line. At that time, materials and equipment transported from all over the country will be able to continuously pass through this spur line to the tractor factory.

    拖拉机制造厂
    修筑铁路专用线
    我国第一个拖拉机制造厂的铁路专用线正在修筑中，淡黄色的路基已经露出了地面。修筑专用线的铁路员工们，为了支援拖拉机制造厂，冒雨运送石碴、枕木和钢轨，紧张地在路基上铺设轨道，争取在今年年底修通全线。今年七月二十日，他们开始动工，八月十八日就铺好了两公里半长的轨道。现在，轻便的车辆已能利用修好的轨道载送筑路的材料。八月底还要在专用线上新修一座长达一百四十多公尺的铁桥。这条铁路专用线修好以后，就可以把拖拉机制造厂和铁路干线联结起来。那时候，各地运来的材料和设备，将可以源源不绝地经过这条专用线送到拖拉机制造厂。
