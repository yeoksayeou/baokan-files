    The Painting Gallery of the Palace Museum systematically displayed a batch of famous paintings from past dynasties such as Jin, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing last October. At that time, the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers was being held in Beijing. The representatives of literary and art workers from all over the country who came to Beijing attached great importance to visiting these famous paintings, and some even visited them several times in succession. Later, from November 1st to December 16th, it was open to the public for a month and a half, and people from all walks of life in the capital went to visit even more enthusiastically. There were also many people from all over the country who were interested in ancient Chinese paintings and came from afar to visit. The total number of visitors was about 50,000. Due to climatic reasons, these ancient famous paintings could not be displayed for a long time. Therefore, after two and a half months of that exhibition, the gallery temporarily stored away the famous paintings from the Jin, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, while the Ming and Qing parts continued to be displayed. Recently, in order to welcome the National Day and the convocation of the First National People's Congress, and in response to the requests of the masses, the gallery has re-exhibited famous paintings from past dynasties after the Jin Dynasty, starting from August 15th, and held the second public exhibition. The content of the exhibition is roughly the same as the first. In order to better protect these ancient famous paintings, the duration of this exhibition is scheduled to be two months.

    故宫博物院绘画馆第二次公开展览历代名画
    故宫博物院绘画馆，曾于去年十月初系统地陈列了一批晋、唐、宋、元、明、清等历代的名画，当时，中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会正在北京举行，各地来京的文艺工作者代表们，都十分重视地参观了这些名画，有的还连续参观了好几次。后来，从十一月一日起至十二月十六日止，公开展览了一个半月，首都各界人民前往参观的更为踊跃，各地还有很多对中国古代绘画有兴趣的人们远道赶来参观。前后观众约计五万多人。由于气候的关系，这些古代名画，不能长期陈列，因此，该馆在那一次展览经过两个半月之后，就将晋、唐、宋、元部分的名画，暂时收存起来，明、清部分则继续陈列。最近，该馆为迎接国庆节和全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开，并应群众的要求，已从八月十五日起，重新陈列了晋以后历代名画，举行第二次公开展览，展出内容，大致和第一次相同。为了很好地保护这些古代名画，这次展览期限，预定是两个月。
