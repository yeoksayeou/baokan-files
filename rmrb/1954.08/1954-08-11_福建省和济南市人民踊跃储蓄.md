People in Fujian Province are increasingly participating in savings, and the deposit figures of the People's Bank are constantly expanding. At present, the province's savings amount has reached 559.5 billion yuan, more than 53 times higher than in 1950.

Among the deposits of people from all walks of life, the proportion of urban workers' deposits is constantly increasing. According to statistics from Fuzhou City in early July this year, the savings amount reached 81.4 billion yuan, more than 268 times higher than in the early days of liberation; the vast majority of which are workers' deposits. The one-year fixed deposit with prize savings, mainly targeting workers, launched in Fujian Province last June, has now accumulated more than 2.069 million households and deposits of more than 82.7 billion yuan; the current monthly savings figure reaches 8 billion yuan, a double increase compared to when the savings business was first launched last year.

The Fujian Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China recently held a provincial urban savings work symposium, deciding to widely carry out savings work in the second half of the year.

The Jinan Business Department of the Shandong Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China vigorously carries out savings business. The business department has recently established more than 60 small savings offices in factories, schools, hospitals, department stores, and streets in Jinan's urban and suburban areas. Since the establishment of these small savings offices, more and more people in Jinan City have participated in savings. In June, the city absorbed a total of 13.2 billion yuan in deposits, an increase of more than 2.5 billion yuan compared to May. As of July 20, people from all walks of life in the city had 120.8 billion yuan saved in the People's Bank, an increase of 106 times compared to 1949.

    福建省和济南市人民踊跃储蓄
    福建省人民参加储蓄的日益增多，人民银行的存款数字不断扩大。现在全省储蓄额达五千五百九十五亿元，比一九五零年增加了五十三倍多。
    在各阶层人民的存款中，城市职工存款比重不断上升。福州市据今年七月初的统计，储蓄额达八百一十四亿元，比解放初期增加了二百六十八倍多；其中绝大多数是职工存款。福建省去年六月创办的、以职工群众为主要对象的一年期零存整取有奖储蓄，现在已收储了二百零六万九千余户，存款有八百二十七亿余元；目前每月收储数字达八十亿元，比去年刚开始举办这一储蓄业务时增加一倍。
    中国人民银行福建省分行最近召开了全省城市储蓄工作座谈会，决定在下半年广泛开展储蓄工作。
    中国人民银行山东省分行济南营业部大力开展储蓄业务。该营业部日前先后在济南市区和郊区的工厂、学校、医院、百货商店、街道建立了六十多个小型储蓄所。这些小型储蓄所建立以后，济南市人民参加储蓄的更加增多。六月份，全市共吸收存款一百三十二亿元，比五月份增加了二十五亿多元。到七月二十日止，全市各界人民储蓄在人民银行的钱有一千二百零八亿元，比一九四九年增加了一百零六倍。
