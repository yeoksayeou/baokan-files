Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, August 28th: The Vietnam News Agency reported that General Wen Jin Yong, the chief representative of the delegation of the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army in the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission, wrote a letter to General De Lattre, the chief representative of the delegation of the High Command of the French Union Forces, on August 25th, strongly protesting the violation of the articles of the agreement reached between the two sides on the exchange of prisoners of war by the French Union Forces. The full text of the letter is as follows:

    After both sides signed the agreement on the transfer of prisoners of war and detained civilians and exchanged the lists of most of the detained personnel, this work began on August 18th thanks to the efforts of both sides. Up to now, the Vietnam People's Army and the French Union Forces have exchanged a considerable number of prisoners of war and detained civilians. After the transfer work has been carried out for some time, we believe it is necessary to raise the following questions to the French Union Forces delegation:

    1. Guarantee the completion of the transfer work within the specified time;
    2. Guarantee the complete and accurate transfer of prisoners of war and detained civilians.

      I. Why is the transfer work delayed? Both sides have exchanged a considerable number of detained personnel. However, even adding the number of detained personnel that may be transferred on August 26th, it is clear that both sides will not be able to complete this work within the time limit stipulated by the Geneva Accords for North Vietnam.

    What is the reason for this delay?

    (A) On the side of the Vietnam People's Army, it has encountered many difficulties. But we have tried to increase the number of prisoners of war transferred daily and to receive more detained personnel than stipulated. For example:

    In Cen Shan, we initially planned to receive only 1,000 to 1,500 people per day. But now we have managed to receive 2,000 people. Previously, we only planned to transfer 80 to 110 detained personnel per day, but now we are transferring 200 to 250 people.

    In Viet Tri, we originally only planned to receive 1,000 people per day, but now the number received is 1,200 to 1,500 people. Initially, we planned to release only 180 to 240 prisoners of war per day, but we sometimes transfer 500 prisoners of war per day.

    In the Fifth Interzone, although the deadline was very late, we have been carrying out the transfer work since August 19th.

   (B) At the same time, the French Union Forces have taken some actions that violate the terms of the agreement, thereby creating many difficulties for the transfer work and delaying the transfer work. Here are some examples:

    The French Union Forces did not transfer the number of detained personnel according to the number stipulated every day. The number they transferred was sometimes very large and sometimes very small. For example, in Cen Shan, the French Union Forces only transferred 1,393 people on August 19th, but the next day, the number increased to 2,800, although the target stipulated in advance was only 2,000 people.

    At some handover stations, the French Union Forces rested for many days after working for one day. In Viet Tri, from August 18th to 23rd, they only carried out the work of transferring and receiving prisoners of war for two days, and suggested resting for four days.

    Many of the detained personnel handed over to us did not have their names on the original list of prisoners of war, but those whose names were on the list were not handed over to us. For example, on August 22nd, of the 2,000 people transferred in Ning Jiang, 284 people listed on the list were not transferred, and the names of 225 people released could not be found on the list. Some French Union Forces guard officers gave each detained person a piece of paper with a name written on it, forcing them to remember and use this new name. Similar incidents also occurred in Viet Tri and Cen Shan. As a result, the transfer work was disrupted and delayed, affecting the health of the prisoners of war.

    On some days, the transfer work dragged on until midnight; sometimes it could not be completed all night, as was the case in Cen Shan on August 19th and 20th.

    In South Vietnam, there are favorable conditions for a faster transfer, and the Vietnam People's Army is ready to receive its prisoners of war there, but the French Union Forces deliberately delayed it, resting for two or four days after working for one day.

    II. The question of guaranteeing the complete and accurate transfer of detained personnel.

    Guaranteeing the completion of the transfer work within the specified time is an important issue. However, the basic and more important issue is that both sides should guarantee the complete and accurate transfer of prisoners of war and detained civilians. Only in this way can the spirit and provisions of the Geneva Accords be faithfully implemented.

      (A) On the side of the Vietnam People's Army:

    (1) After we notified the French Union Forces of the number of prisoners of war to be transferred, we have corrected and completed this list. In the Viet Bac Interzone, the number of prisoners of war we transferred increased by 144, and in the Fifth Interzone it increased by 140. We are still continuing to correct and complete this list in accordance with the agreement reached in Zhongjia.

    (2) We have prepared a list of senior officers of the French Union Forces who were captured, such as General de Castries, Lieutenant Colonel Le Pasquier, Lieutenant Colonel Chardon, Colonel Lalande, and other officers of various ranks.

      (B) On the contrary, the French Union Forces have shown an intention to detain our detained personnel, especially political cadres, government cadres, and mass organization cadres in the Vietnam People's Army.

      (1) The list of prisoners of war given to us does not include the names of prisoners detained in prisons that hold thousands of political prisoners (such as Chi Hoa Prison in Saigon).

    Prisoner-of-war camps such as Con Dao, Thanh Liet (Ha Dong Province), and Hung Thanh Tay (Gia Dinh Province) hold a large number of prisoners of war. However, only a very small number of prisoners of war in these prisoner-of-war camps are included in the list, some only one-tenth of the detained personnel are included in the list.

    Judging from the list submitted by the French Union Forces, the number of prisoners of war captured from 1945 to 1948 is negligible. There are only thirteen people on the list. The number of those arrested before 1952 who will be released is very small. Most of the released prisoners of war were captured during the period from the end of 1953 to 1954.

    (2) The list of detained cadres is incomplete. In fact, the French Union Forces have captured thousands of cadres at the company or county level and above. But on the prisoner-of-war list, there are only seventeen battalion-level cadres and one hundred and forty-three company-level cadres. Only two cadres have been released so far. There are no regimental-level cadres, no government cadres, and no political cadres at any level on the list.

    It is worth noting that among those released by the French Union Forces who are called dangerous detainees, most of them are actually civilians who were taken away by the French Union Forces when they were fishing, going to market, or working in the rice fields. Moreover, many of the people released above are teenagers and elderly people. For example, of the 1,942 people released in Cen Shan on August 19th, there were 107 teenagers aged 12 to 16, and of the 1,000 people released in Viet Tri on August 20th, there were 82 elderly people over 52 years old, and of the 1,200 people handed over in Viet Tri on August 24th, there were more than 100 people over 50 years old.

      (3) The list of prisoners of war submitted by the French Union Forces is very chaotic, and the list does not indicate the prisoner-of-war camp or the rank and position of the prisoner of war. The prisoners of war are not sorted in an orderly manner according to the prisoner-of-war camp or according to number. There are cases where the names of dozens of prisoners of war are written twice. The organization of the transfer is also chaotic and not carried out according to the prescribed procedures, thus causing many difficulties in management and reception.

      Moreover, the French Union Forces side also has incomprehensible actions. It intends to transfer the personnel detained in the Cam Lo camp in the Fourth Interzone of Northern Central Vietnam to the Fifth Interzone of Southern Central Vietnam for transfer, and vice versa.

    Violating the terms of the agreement, delaying the transfer work; creating chaotic prisoner-of-war lists that cause new difficulties in reception; only a small number of those captured before 1952 and very few cadres written on the list in the list of prisoners of war to be released; the incompleteness of the list of prisoners of war detained in major prisons - all these facts prove that this is not just a matter of organization or method, this is a question of whether the High Command of the French Union Forces has the sincerity to transfer all our personnel. The above facts show that the French Union Forces lack this determination. This may be because the High Command of the French Union Forces itself intends to detain our personnel. It may also be that it encourages or acquiesces in the Ngô Đình Diệm government's detention of our personnel and takes actions to undermine the agreements reached in order to obstruct the work of transferring prisoners of war and prevent prisoners of war from returning to reunite with their families as soon as possible. Here is concrete proof:

    On August 23rd, the detained personnel transferred to us by the French Union Forces handed over a document they obtained to the representative of the Vietnam People's Army in front of the representative of the French Union Forces, and the representative of the French Union Forces admitted that the document was authentic. The number of this document is ○一, which is an order issued by Major Trần Vĩnh Đắc, the chief of the Phú Quốc Island Independent Sub-region, on August 12th, 1954. This order states that the management committee of this temporary prisoner-of-war camp only obeys the instructions of the chief of the sub-region and shall not obey any decisions of other authorities without the consent of the chief of the sub-region. This order also clearly mentions that this order replaces and cancels all the terms previously agreed upon at the military conference in Zhongjia.

    I strongly protest this violation of the ceasefire agreement on behalf of the delegation of the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army.

    We believe that the implementation of the ceasefire agreement must rely on the sincerity of both sides. If the French Union Forces side does not guarantee the accurate transfer of all our personnel detained by the French Union Forces side (specifically, those detained in prisoner-of-war camps in Chi Hoa, Con Dao, Hung Thanh Tay, and Thanh Liet, those detained before 1952, and those detained since the implementation of the ceasefire), then both sides will encounter many difficulties and obstacles in guaranteeing the exchange of all detained personnel. August 25, 1954, Vietnam.

    文进勇将军写给法方首席代表的信件
    【新华社讯】越南通讯社北越二十八日电：越南中央联合停战委员会中的越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇将军在八月二十五日写信给法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团首席代表戴尔特尔将军，对法兰西联邦部队违反双方关于交换战俘问题所达成的协议的条款一事提出强硬抗议。信件全文如下：
    在双方签订了关于移交战俘和被拘平民的协议并且交换了大多数被拘人员的名单以后，由于双方的努力，这一工作已在八月十八日开始了。到现在为止，越南人民军和法兰西联邦部队已交换了数目相当大的战俘和被拘平民。在移交工作进行了一些时候以后，我们认为有必要向法兰西联邦部队代表团提出以下的问题：
    1、保证在规定的时间以内完成移交工作；
    2、保证战俘和被拘平民全部和正确无误地移交。
      一、为什么移交工作拖延了呢？双方已经交换了数目相当大的被拘人员。但是即使加上可能在八月二十六日移交的被拘人员的数目，双方显然还是不能在日内瓦协定为北越所规定的期限以内完成这项工作。
    这种拖延的原因是什么呢？
    （甲）在越南人民军方面，它曾遇到许多困难。但是我们已经努力增加每天移交的战俘数目以及接收比规定数目较多的被拘人员。例如：
    在岑山，我们最初准备每天只接收一千人到一千五百人。但是现在我们已经设法接收二千人。以前我们只计划每天移交八十到一百一十名被拘人员，但是现在移交二百到二百五十名。
    在越池，我们原来只准备每天接收一千人，但是现在接收的数目是一千二百人到一千五百人。最初我们计划每天只释放一百八十名到二百四十名战俘，但是我们有时每天移交五百名战俘。
    在第五联区，虽然规定的期限很晚，但是我们从八月十九日起就进行了移交工作。
   （乙）同时，法兰西联邦部队作出了一些同协议的条款相违背的行为，从而给移交工作制造了许多困难并耽搁了移交工作。下面是一些例子：
    法兰西联邦部队并没有依照每天规定移交被拘人员的数目进行移交，他们移交的数目有时候非常大，有时候又非常小。例如在岑山，法兰西联邦部队在八月十九日仅仅移交了一千三百九十三人，但在第二天，这个数目增加到二千八百人，虽然事先规定的目标只是二千人。
    在有些交接站，法兰西联邦部队工作一天后便休息许多天。在越池，从八月十八日到二十三日，他们只进行了两天的移交和接收战俘的工作，建议休息了四天。
    许多移交给我们的被拘人员在原先开列的战俘名单上没有名字，而名单上有名字的却不移交给我们。例如，八月二十二日，在宁江移交的两千人中，开列在名单上的有二百八十四人没有移交，而被释放的人有二百二十五人的名字是在名单上找不到的。有些法兰西联邦部队的警卫军官们发给每个被拘人员一个纸条，上面写着某个名字，强迫他们记住并用这个新名字。类似的事件在越池和岑山也发生过，结果，移交工作被搞乱并拖延下来，影响了战俘的健康。
    有些天，移交工作一直拖到半夜；有些时候拖了一整夜还不能结束，八月十九日和二十日在岑山就是那样。
    在南越，有较迅速地移交的有利条件，而且在那里越南人民军已准备好接收自己的战俘，可是法兰西联邦部队方面却故意拖延，工作一天后要休息两天或四天。
    二、保证被拘人员全部和正确无误地移交的问题。
    保证在规定的时间以内完成移交工作是一个重要的问题。但是，基本的、更重要的问题是双方应当保证战俘和被拘平民全部和正确无误地移交。只有这样做，才能忠实地实现日内瓦协定的精神和规定。
      （甲）在越南人民军方面：
    （一）我们在把将要移交的战俘的数目通知法兰西联邦部队以后，已校正了并完成了这张名单。在越北联区，我们所移交的战俘的人数增加了一百四十四名，在第五联区增加了一百四十名。我们还在继续按照在中稼达成的协议校正和完成这张名单。
    （二）我们已经制好了被俘的法兰西联邦部队高级军官的名单，例如德卡斯特莱将军、勒帕歇中校、夏尔东中校，拉兰德上校等以及其他各级军官。
      （乙）相反的，法兰西联邦部队方面却显示出有扣留我方被拘人员、特别是越南人民军中的政治干部、政府干部和群众组织干部的意图。
      （一）交给我们的战俘名单中没有包括被拘留在一些集中了上千名政治犯的监狱（如西贡的志和监狱）中的被囚人员的名字。
    像昆仑岛、清列（河东省）、亨通西（嘉定省）这些战俘营集中了大量的战俘。但是，这些战俘营中的战俘只有极少数的人包括在名单之内，有的只有十分之一的被拘人员包括在名单之内。
    从法兰西联邦部队交来的名单来看，自一九四五年到一九四八年被俘的战俘的数目是微不足道的。名单上只有十三个人。将被释放的在一九五二年前被捕的人员的数目是很小的。释放的战俘中大多数是在一九五三年年底到一九五四年这个期间被俘的。
    （二）被拘的干部的名单是不完整的。事实上，法兰西联邦部队曾俘掳成千的连级或县级以上的干部。但是在战俘名单上，只有十七名营级干部和一百四十三名连级干部。直到现在已释放的干部只有二人。名单上没有团级干部，没有政府干部，也没有各级政治干部。
    值得注意的是，在被法兰西联邦部队释放的被称为危险的被拘人员中，大多数人实际上是平民，这些人是当他们在捕鱼、赶集、或在稻田中耕作时被法兰西联邦部队掳去的。而且，上述被释放的人中有很多人是少年和老年人。例如，八月十九日在岑山释放的一千九百四十二人中就有一百零七名十二岁到十六岁的少年，八月二十日在越池释放的一千人中有八十二名五十二岁以上的老年人，八月二十四日在越池交来的一千二百人中有一百多人年在五十岁以上。
      （三）法兰西联邦部队交来的战俘名单非常混乱，名单中没有注明战俘营以及战俘的级别和职位。战俘们不是按照战俘营或者按照编号有次序地分类的。有这样的情形：几十个战俘的名字都写了两次。移交的组织工作也是混乱的，没有按照规定的手续进行，因此使得管理和接收遇到许多困难。
      而且，法兰西联邦部队方面还有令人不解的行动，它打算把中越北部第四联区甘露营场拘留的人员移到中越南部第五联区去移交，反过来也是这样。
    违反达成协议的条款，拖延移交工作；造成接收上的新困难的战俘名单的混乱，在将要释放的战俘的名单中只有少数在一九五二年以前被俘的人员以及写上名单的干部极少；交来的在各大监狱中拘留的战俘的名单的不完全——所有这些事实证明：这不仅是组织或方式的问题，这是法兰西联邦部队总司令部是否有诚意把我方所有人员加以移交的问题。上述事实说明：法兰西联邦部队缺乏这种决心。这可能是法兰西联邦部队总司令部本身存心扣留我方人员。这也可能是：它怂恿或默许吴庭艳政府扣留我方人员并采取行动破坏已达成的协议，以便阻挠移交战俘的工作和阻碍战俘不得及早回去和他们的家人团聚。以下就是具体的证明：
    在八月二十三日，被法兰西联邦部队移交给我方的被拘人员，当着法兰西联邦部队代表的面把一个他们得到的文件交给越南人民军代表，法兰西联邦部队代表承认这个文件是真实的。这个文件的编号是○一，这是富国岛独立分区长官陈永得少校在一九五四年八月十二日发出的命令。这个命令说，这个临时战俘营的管理委员会只服从分区长官的指示，未经分区长官同意不得服从其他当局的任何决定。这条命令还清楚地提到，这一命令代替并取消先前在中稼当地军事会议上达成协议的一切条款。
    我代表越南人民军总司令部代表团强烈地抗议这种违背停战协定的行为。
    我们认为，停战协定的履行必须依靠双方的诚意。如果法兰西联邦部队一方不保证正确无误地移交我方所有被法兰西联邦部队方面拘留的人员（具体地说是被拘留在志和、昆仑岛、亨通西和清列等地战俘营中的人，在一九五二年以前被拘留的人，以及在实行停战以来被拘留的人），那末双方在保证交换全部被拘人员时将遭到许多困难和障碍。一九五四年八月二十五日越南
