    Helping Labor Models Overcome Pride

    The Shaanxi Peasant News published an article on August 1st by agricultural labor model and director of the Huangfu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali, Shaanxi, Ma Tinghai: "We Must Eliminate My Pride and Complacency."

    This is a self-criticism written by Comrade Ma Tinghai after participating in the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party of Shaanxi Province and receiving education on opposing pride. In the article, Ma Tinghai profoundly exposed various manifestations of his pride and complacency. In the summer of 1952, in order to establish an agricultural production cooperative, the leadership sent Ma Tinghai to Jie County, Shanxi, to visit and study. In the winter of the same year, the Weinan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent cadres to live in Huangfu Village for several months to help Ma Tinghai establish an agricultural production cooperative. After the cooperative was established, the Party committees at all levels continued to provide specific guidance and assistance. Pan Zili, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and other responsible comrades went to guide the work. However, Ma Tinghai regarded the care and guidance of the higher Party committee as his capital for pride. Thus, "Sometimes I don't respect district and township cadres. I am happy when they praise me; if they criticize me, I am unhappy. I think: People from the Special Zone, the Province, and the Northwest Bureau have all visited our cooperative, how much can you understand, and yet you criticize me." "Some work doesn't even go through the township." Once, regarding the issue of buying grain, he even "ran to the district and had a quarrel with Director Yuan." In the past, Ma Tinghai not only lacked understanding of the Party's leadership but also underestimated the strength of the masses, "only thinking that my, Ma Tinghai's, contribution was great." Therefore, when three cooperative members often criticized the shortcomings of the cooperative's work, Ma Tinghai not only did not humbly accept their criticism but also mistakenly thought: "Even if these three households withdraw from the cooperative, my cooperative will still operate the same!" Ma Tinghai even lost his temper with a blind cooperative member, saying, "Without me, you would have starved to death long ago!" Because Ma Tinghai was so proud, some cooperative members learned from his example. Once, when the district Party secretary introduced them to the experience of the Youai Agricultural Production Cooperative in contracting work and organizing labor, some cooperative members said, "What's there to learn? We've already done all of this, and if we summarize it, we'll do even better than them!" At that time, Ma Tinghai not only did not persuade them but also thought, "How much experience can their newly established cooperative have? What's there to learn!"

    In the article, Ma Tinghai criticized his very harmful pride and complacency. Ma Tinghai wrote, "Take running the agricultural cooperative for example, I, a peasant who came from being a hired farmhand, had never touched it before... If the Party hadn't helped us so much, what could I have done alone to lead?" Ma Tinghai also saw the strength of the cooperative members. "Cooperative member Xu Xiaoming always asks to do the hardest work"; "Deputy Director Hou Yuqin gets up before dawn to call the female cooperative members to get up and work"... "Without the cooperative members working so hard together, no matter how capable Ma Tinghai is, we wouldn't have the kind of life we have now!" Because Ma Tinghai realized that the achievements made in the past "were all made under the leadership of the Party, through everyone's hard work," and that "although he contributed a bit, he can't say that all the credit is his alone," therefore, he expressed his determination to overcome pride and complacency, "to listen to the Party, and work and study humbly and diligently."

    While publishing Ma Tinghai's article, the Shaanxi Peasant News also published a commentary in the "Everyone's Talk" column entitled "Don't Write the Party's and Everyone's Contributions on Your Own Account." On the one hand, it encouraged Ma Tinghai's spirit of self-criticism, and on the other hand, it clarified the educational significance of Ma Tinghai's self-criticism for everyone, especially for some agricultural production cooperative directors and labor models. The commentary pointed out that we must not only appropriately estimate our past achievements and contributions but, more importantly, see that the tasks of building socialism in the future will become increasingly important. "If we don't see this, become complacent, proud, look down on district and township cadres, are unwilling to learn from other people's experiences, and don't unite the masses inside and outside the cooperative, then we won't be able to run the cooperative well and continue to advance together."

    At present, agricultural labor models and leading members of mutual aid and cooperation organizations who have pride and complacency like Ma Tinghai are by no means isolated cases. Paying attention to conducting ideological education for them, helping them get rid of the burden of pride and complacency, and removing stumbling blocks on the road to advancement are undoubtedly responsibilities that our newspapers cannot ignore.

### 帮助劳动模范克服骄傲情绪

    帮助劳动模范克服骄傲情绪
    陕西农民报在八月一日发表了农业劳动模范、陕西大荔黄甫村农业生产合作社主任马廷海的一篇文章：“一定要去掉我的骄傲自满情绪”。
    这是马廷海同志在参加中共陕西省第一次代表大会、受到反对骄傲情绪的教育后所写的一篇自我检讨。马廷海在文中比较深刻地揭露了自己骄傲自满情绪的各种表现。一九五二年夏天，为了办农业生产合作社，领导上派马廷海到山西解县去参观和学习；同年冬天，中共渭南地委派干部到黄甫村住了几个月，帮助马廷海办起了农业生产合作社。社办起来后，各级党委一直不断地进行具体指导和帮助，中共陕西省委书记潘自力和其他一些负责同志都去指导过工作。可是马廷海却把上级党委的关心和指导，看成自己骄傲的“本钱”。于是，“有时候不尊重区、乡干部，他们说我好，我高兴；要是批评我，我就不痛快。我想：我们办这个社，专区、省上、西北局都来过人，你们能懂多少，还批评我哩。”“有的工作都不经过乡上”。有一次为了买粮问题，竟“跑到区上和员区长吵了一顿”。马廷海过去不光对党的领导认识不够，对大家的力量也估计不足，“只觉得我马廷海一个人的功劳大”。因此，有三个社员对社里工作上的缺点常提出批评，马廷海不但不虚心接受，反而错误地想：“就是你三户退社，我这个社也一样地办哩！”马廷海甚至曾对一个瞎子社员发脾气说：“没有我，早把你饿死啦！”由于马廷海这样骄傲，有些社员也学他的样子。有一次，区委书记给他们介绍友爱农业生产合作社包工和组织劳力的经验，有些社员就说：“学啥哩，这都是咱做过的，咱一总结，比他们还好哩！”马廷海当时不但没说服他们，自己心里也想，
  “他们新建立几天的社，能有多大经验？有啥学的呢！”
    马廷海在文中对于自己这种非常有害的骄傲自满情绪，进行了批判。马廷海写道：“拿办农业社来说吧，我这个熬长工出身的庄稼汉，过去是一手不摸的。……要是没有党这么帮助我们，凭我一个人来领导，能干个啥？”马廷海也看到了社员们的力量。“社员许校明，哪样活苦，他就要求干哪样活”；“副主任侯玉琴，天不明就挨门挨户叫女社员起床劳动”……“要没有社员们这样齐心苦干，我马廷海再能，也闹不成现在这样的日子！”由于马廷海认识到过去做出的成绩“都是在党领导下，大家伙努力干出来的”，“自己虽然出了一分力，可不能说那功劳都是自己一个人的”，因此，他表示决心克服骄傲自满情绪，“一定要听党的话，虚心、踏实地工作、学习”。
    陕西农民报在发表马廷海的文章的同时，还在“大家谈”栏中以“不要把党和大家的功劳写在自己账上”为题发表评论，一方面鼓励了马廷海的自我批评精神，另一方面阐明了马廷海的检讨对于大家特别是对于一些农业生产合作社主任和劳动模范的教育意义。评论指出，我们不但要适当地估计自己过去的成绩和功劳，更要紧的是，要看到今后建设社会主义的任务越来越重大。“如果看不到这一点，洋洋得意，骄傲自满，瞧不起区乡干部，不愿学习人家的经验，也不团结社内社外群众，就办不好社、不能继续共同前进。”
    目前，像马廷海一样有着骄傲自满情绪的农业劳动模范和互助合作组织的领导骨干，决不是个别的。注意对他们进行思想教育、帮助他们丢掉骄傲自满的包袱，清除前进道路上的绊脚石，无疑是我们报纸不能忽视的责任。（蒲宇平）
