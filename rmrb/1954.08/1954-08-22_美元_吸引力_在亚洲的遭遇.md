    The dollar's "Attraction" Encountered in Asia
    Yan Nan
    Everyone knows that Wall Street bosses believe in "the omnipotence of the dollar." However, believers in "the omnipotence of the dollar" have recently suffered another major setback in Asia.
    The foreign ministers of eight countries—the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan—will meet in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, on September 6 to discuss the Southeast Asia invasion treaty that the United States has long planned. Originally, according to the list drawn up by the United States, the names of representatives from India, Burma, Indonesia, and Ceylon were also on the list of participants in the Manila Conference, but these countries rejected the United States' "enthusiastic" invitation. The reason why they refused to participate in the Manila Conference is very simple, that is, the military nature of this treaty is clearly contrary to the peaceful aspirations and national interests of these Asian countries. The "Indian Times" emphasized that India does not want the pleasant atmosphere of peace generated after the Geneva Conference to be destroyed by any threats, force, or negotiations about force. Indonesian officials also said that participating in this military organization is contrary to Indonesia's independent foreign policy. Burma's "Nation" newspaper stated more clearly: If these countries showed "indifference" to the Pacific invasion group before the Geneva Conference was held, then they are now "actively opposed" to this invasion group.
    The reason why the United States invited these countries to participate in the Manila Conference, simply put, is to have them jointly bear the military obligations of the Southeast Asia invasion treaty. According to the Associated Press, the Pentagon "does not want to get involved in a Korean-style collective effort" because the United States "provided most of the manpower and suffered significant losses" in the Korean War. Now, it hopes that the Manila Conference will first create a political "skeleton" and then ask the countries participating in the conference to add military "muscle." That is to say, the United States itself does not intend to assume many military obligations, but wants the countries participating in this invasion treaty to assume them; to put it more bluntly, this is still the old idea of ​​the United States: "Use Asians to fight Asians!"
    These Asian countries have seen that assuming the military obligations of this invasion treaty requires not only manpower but also money—increasing military spending. Australia is an example: the Menzies government, which is following the United States' policy of aggression, has expressed its willingness to "provide weapons, soldiers, and ammunition" to support this invasion treaty, so it has to increase military spending by another 140 million US dollars. These Asian countries naturally know that this approach is very dangerous. Therefore, it is only natural that they refuse to participate in the Manila Conference.
    As a result, the United States knows that things are not good. It began to feel that "organizing an armed anti-communist camp in Asia does not have much appeal" to Asian governments (Reuters), so it immediately changed its tune and said that the United States intends to put the "focus" of the Manila Conference on improving the economy of the region (United Press), that is, to use dollars to "help" these countries and intends to use the "attraction" of the dollar to drag these countries into the Southeast Asia invasion group. However, according to the Associated Press, US authorities also admitted that the focus of the Manila Conference will be on "defense (should be read as military aggression) issues," and economic issues will be considered later. The United States' so-called "focus" on "economy" is nothing more than a deceptive trick. Naturally, the "attraction" of the dollar will not play any role. Burma's "New Era" newspaper bluntly told the United States that these Asian countries "will never be bought or forced."
    The "attraction" of the dollar did not "attract" these Asian countries to Manila. This fact reflects how isolated the United States, which is pursuing a policy of aggression against Asia, is in Asia! It can be predicted: The Manila Conference, convened by the United States under the banner of "Southeast Asia" but without the participation of major Southeast Asian countries, has a very bleak prospect!

    Under the direct encouragement of the American master, Syngman Rhee issued a series of war cries in Washington. At the same time, according to American newspapers, the United States has drawn up a new plan to increase the funds to "aid" the Rhee gang from more than 800 million US dollars per year to more than 1 billion US dollars.

    美元“吸引力”在亚洲的遭遇
    燕南
    大家知道，华尔街老板们是相信“美元万能”的。可是，“美元万能”的信奉者最近在亚洲又栽了一个大跟头。
    美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦八个国家的外交部长，将于九月六日在菲律宾首都马尼拉开会，讨论美国老早就筹划的东南亚侵略公约问题。本来，按照美国拟订的名单上，参加马尼拉会议的还有印度、缅甸、印尼和锡兰的代表的名字，可是这些国家却拒绝美国的“热心的”邀请。它们拒绝参加马尼拉会议的原因很简单，那就是这个公约的军事性质显然是违反这些亚洲国家的和平愿望和民族利益的。“印度时报”强调说，印度不希望日内瓦会议之后产生的愉快的和平气氛，被任何威胁，武力或关于武力的谈判所破坏。印尼的官方人士也说，参加这个军事组织，是和印尼实行的独立的外交政策互相矛盾的。缅甸“民族报”更明白地说：如果这些国家在日内瓦会议召开之前对太平洋侵略集团表示“冷淡”的话，那么它们现在对这个侵略集团则是“积极反对”。
    美国所以邀请这些国家参加马尼拉会议，简单地说，就是要它们共同承担东南亚侵略公约的军事义务。据美联社透露，五角大楼“不希望卷入朝鲜式的集体努力中”，因为美国在侵朝战争中“提供了大多数的人力，遭到重大的损失”。现在，它希望马尼拉会议先创立一个政治
  “骨架”，然后再要求参加会议的国家给添上军事
  “肌肉”。这就是说，美国自己并不打算承担多少军事义务，而要参加这个侵略公约的国家去承担；说得更明白些，这仍然是美国的老主意：“用亚洲人打亚洲人”！
    这些亚洲国家都看到了，承担这个侵略公约的军事义务，不仅要出人，而且要出钱——增加军费。澳大利亚就是一个例子：跟着美国侵略政策跑的孟席斯政府表示愿意“拿出武器、兵员和弹药”来支持这个侵略公约，它就不得不再增加一笔一亿四千万美元的军费。这些亚洲国家自然知道，这种做法是十分危险的。因此，它们拒绝参加马尼拉会议也是理所当然的。
    这样一来，美国知道不妙了。它开始感到“在亚洲组织一个武装反共阵营对于亚洲各国政府”“不会有多大吸引力”（路透社），于是就马上改口说，美国打算把马尼拉会议讨论的“重点”放在改善这个地区的经济上（合众社），就是说用美元来
  “帮助”这些国家，打算用美元的“吸引力”把这些国家拖入东南亚侵略集团。然而，据美联社透露，美国当局人士也承认，马尼拉会议的重点将放在“防御（应读作军事侵略）问题”上，关于经济问题将在以后考虑。美国的所谓“重点”放在“经济上”只不过是一句骗人的鬼话而已。自然，美元的“吸引力”也起不了什么作用了。“缅甸新时代报”就直率地对美国说，这些亚洲国家“绝不会被收买或被强迫”。
    美元的“吸引力”并没有把这些亚洲国家“吸引”到马尼拉去。这个事实反映了对亚洲实行侵略政策的美国，在亚洲是多么孤立！可以预料：美国打着“东南亚”的旗号召开的、但却没有东南亚主要国家参加的马尼拉会议，它的前景是多么暗淡！（附图片）

    在美国主子的直接鼓励下，李承晚在华盛顿发出一连串的战争叫嚣。同时，据美国报纸透露：美国已拟订一项新计划，将“援助”李匪帮的款项由每年八亿美元以上增加到十亿美元以上。
