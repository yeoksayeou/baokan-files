Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, August 25th: The Vietnam People's Army and the French Union forces conducted the transfer of prisoners of war and detained civilians in five locations—Viet Tri, Cam Son, Ninh Giang, the Fifth Interzone of Central Vietnam, and South Vietnam—over five days from August 18th to 22nd. In Quynh Hoi, Nghe An province, preparations are underway for the transfer.

The Vietnam People's Army has handed over 2,381 prisoners of war from the French Union forces, most of whom are Europeans and Africans. This figure does not include the prisoners of war transferred by the Vietnam People's Army in South Vietnam and the Fifth Interzone on August 21st and 22nd.

During the same period, the French Union forces handed over 12,584 people to the Vietnam People's Army, most of whom were civilians.

In the five-day prisoner of war transfer, the Vietnam People's Army actively fulfilled the terms of the agreement between the two sides, overcame all difficulties, and completed the task on time.

The delegation of the Vietnam People's Army had submitted the list of captured soldiers, officers, and non-commissioned officers of the French Union forces to the other party at the meeting of the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission in Vietnam. In Cam Son, the Vietnam People's Army also helped the other party overcome shortcomings in organization and in drawing up the list of prisoners of war, thus enabling the transfer to be completed quickly.

Conversely, the French side deliberately delayed the work, and many cadres of the Vietnam People's Army were not included in the list of prisoners of war. Moreover, at the transfer locations, French personnel often made excuses to delay the progress of the transfer.

In the prisoner-of-war camps of the French Union forces, the Ngo Dinh Diem group used various means to secretly transfer prisoners of war, attempting to murder important cadres. On the other hand, they dispatched their agents to carry out provocative activities, thus creating many difficulties for the transfer work. The prisoner of war exchange over the past five days has further exposed the conspiracy of the Ngo Dinh Diem group.

The list of detained Vietnamese People's Army fighters, cadres, and civilians presented by the French Union forces is unreasonable. The list does not mention those detained in 1945 and 1946, only one person in 1947, twelve people in 1948, and one hundred and fifteen people in 1949. On the list of so-called volunteers, there are 600 women aged from 16 to 20, all of whom were arrested while going to the market or in the rice fields.

From some of the prisoners of war recently transferred by the French side, it can be seen that there were 107 children in the transfer carried out in Cam Son on August 18th and 82 elderly people in the transfer carried out in Viet Tri on August 20th.

The French authorities should bear full responsibility for these sabotage activities. In order for both parties to fully implement all the terms of the agreement, the French Union forces must immediately prohibit these sabotage activities and punish those who attempt to hide or murder cadres of the Vietnam People's Army still detained by the French side.

    越南停战双方移交战俘和被拘平民的情况
   【新华社二十六日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十五日讯：越南人民军和法兰西联邦部队从八月十八日到二十二日的五天中，在五个地点即越池、岑山、宁江、中越第五联区和南越，进行了移交战俘和被拘平民的工作。在义安省果会，正在为移交工作进行准备。
    越南人民军已交给对方两千三百八十一名法兰西联邦部队战俘，其中大部分是欧洲人和非洲人。这个数字并不包括越南人民军在八月二十一日和二十二日在南越和第五联区所移交的战俘在内。
    在同一时期，法兰西联邦部队移交给越南人民军一万二千五百八十四人，其中大部分是平民。
    越南人民军在五天的移交战俘工作中，积极地履行了双方协议的条款，克服了一切困难，准时完成了任务。
    越南人民军代表团曾在越南中央联合停战委员会会议上把被俘的法兰西联邦部队的士兵、军官和士官的名单交给对方。在岑山，越南人民军还帮助对方克服了在组织上和制订战俘名单上的缺点，从而使移交工作得以迅速完成。
    相反地，法国方面却故意拖延工作，许多越南人民军的干部一直没有列入战俘名单之内。而且，在移交地点，法方工作人员经常假托许多借口，拖延移交工作的进行。
    在法兰西联邦部队的战俘营中，吴庭艳集团利用各种手段偷偷地调动战俘，企图谋杀重要的干部。另一方面，他们派遣他们的特务进行挑衅活动，因而为移交工作制造了许多困难。在过去五天进行的交换战俘的工作中，进一步暴露了吴庭艳集团的阴谋。
    法兰西联邦部队方面所提出的被拘越南人民军战士、干部和平民的名单是不合理的。这个名单没有提到在一九四五年和一九四六年被拘留的人，一九四七年只有一个人，一九四八年只有十二个人，一九四九年有一百一十五人。在所谓志愿人员的名单上，有六百名从十六岁到二十岁的妇女，而她们都是在到市场去的途中或在稻田中被抓走的。
    从法国方面最近移交来的一些战俘中可以看出，八月十八日在岑山进行的移交中有一百零七名儿童，八月二十日在越池进行的移交中有八十二名老年人。
    法国当局应对这些破坏活动承担全部责任。为了使双方能够充分履行一切协议的条款，法兰西联邦部队必须立刻禁止这些破坏活动，并惩办那些企图隐藏或谋杀仍为法国方面拘留着的越南人民军干部的人。
