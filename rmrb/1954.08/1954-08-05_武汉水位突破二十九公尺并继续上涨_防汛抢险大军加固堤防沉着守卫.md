Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 3rd: As of 10 PM on the 3rd, the Wuhan Customs water level had risen to 28.99 meters, exceeding the highest historical water level by 0.71 meters. The 100,000-strong flood prevention army in Wuhan is taking advantage of the clear weather to accelerate the completion of the third phase of dike reinforcement project.

On the Zhanggong Dike north of Hankou, long lines of trucks and countless boats are transporting large quantities of earth, stone, and various wind and wave protection equipment. The dikes are lined with tents, and many PLA soldiers, basic construction workers, and farmers are redoubling their efforts to reinforce the dikes.

After reaching 28.82 meters on July 30th, the Wuhan water level temporarily stabilized at around 28.72 meters, then quickly began to rise again. As of 10 PM on August 3rd, the Wuhan Customs water level reached 28.99 meters, exceeding the highest historical water level of 28.28 meters by 0.71 meters.

Currently, the water level is still rising. The flood peaks from the Yangtze River and Han River will continue to arrive. The Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters has established a strong rescue team to steadfastly guard the dikes.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 4th: The people of Wuhan are calmly and tenaciously engaged in a arduous struggle against the Yangtze River flood exceeding 29 meters. The water level at Wuhan Customs exceeded 29 meters at 1 AM on the 4th and continues to rise. By 8 PM on the 4th, it had reached 29.08 meters, exceeding the water level of 26.94 meters when Hankou was breached during the Kuomintang reactionary rule in 1931 by 2.14 meters.

As the flood rises, the third phase of dike reinforcement project in Hankou has been basically completed ahead of schedule on the 4th. By this point, more than 100 kilometers of dikes in Wuhan have reached an elevation of 29.5 to 30 meters. Outside Zhanggong Dike near Daijiashan, north of Hankou, windbreak wooden rafts spanning more than ten li have been anchored in place. Willow branches have been hung along the banks of the Yangtze River and Han River, and large quantities of bamboo strips, stones, and sacks and other emergency materials have been piled up on each dike section. Wuchang District is stepping up the construction of the third phase of the project. The riverside sub-dikes along the 60-plus kilometer line from Jinkou Niutoushan to Qingshan Wufeng Sluice Gate have all been raised to an elevation of 30 meters or more. The Xianghe River area in Hanyang is further strengthening dike patrols and inspections.

Based on the current situation, the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters has decided to immediately mobilize the people of the city to carry out the fourth phase of dike reinforcement and elevation project starting on the 4th. It will fully utilize the favorable conditions of Wuhan as a large city to universally reinforce and elevate the dikes, and further strengthen rescue and wind protection equipment in order to overcome the current flood exceeding 29 meters.

    防汛抢险大军加固堤防沉着守卫
   【新华社武汉三日电】三日晚十时，武汉关水位已涨到二八点九九公尺，高出历年最高水位零点七一公尺。武汉市十万防汛大军正利用晴朗的天气，加快速度完成第三期加强堤防的工程计划。
    在汉口北面的张公堤上，长列的汽车和无数的船只正运来大批土方、石方和各种防风、防浪的设备。堤防上帐篷林立，许多解放军战士、基本建设工人和农民，正在加倍努力地加固堤防。
    武汉水位从七月三十日达到二八点八二公尺后，曾暂时稳定在二八点七二公尺左右，接着很快又开始回升。截至八月三日晚上十时，武汉关水位达到二八点九九公尺，比历年最高水位二八点二八公尺高出零点七一公尺。
    目前，水位仍在继续上涨。川江和汉水洪峰还将接着到来，武汉市防汛总指挥部已建立一支强有力的抢险队伍，沉着地守卫着堤防。
   【新华社武汉四日电】武汉市人民正沉着顽强地和二九公尺以上的长江洪水作艰巨的斗争。武汉关的水位，从四日晨一时已突破二九公尺，现仍继续上涨，到四日下午八时，已达到二九点零八公尺，比一九三一年国民党反动派统治时期汉口决堤时二六点九四公尺的水位已高出二点一四公尺。
    随着洪水的上涨，汉口第三期加固堤防的工程计划已提前在四日基本完成，至此，武汉市一百多公里堤防线已达到二九点五公尺到三零公尺的标高。汉口以北戴家山附近的张公堤外，长约十多华里的防浪木排已抛锚定位，沿长江和汉水的堤岸上大都挂上了柳枝，各个堤段都堆放着大批竹篾、石块、麻袋等抢险器材。武昌区正加紧进行第三期工程施工，自金口牛头山到青山武丰闸一线，全长六十多公里的江堤子埝一律加高到标高三零公尺以上。汉阳襄河沿线正进一步加强堤防的巡逻、检查工作。
    武汉市防汛总指挥部根据目前情况，决定从四日起立即动员全市人民进行第四期堤防加固加高工程，充分运用武汉这个大城市的有利条件，把堤防普遍加固加高，进一步加强抢险和防风设备，以战胜当前二九公尺以上的洪水。
