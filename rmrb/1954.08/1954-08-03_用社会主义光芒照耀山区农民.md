    Using Socialist Light to Illuminate Mountain Farmers

    In Sichuan, there are vast mountainous areas. The cultivated land in these mountains accounts for approximately 16% of the province's total cultivated land, and the population accounts for roughly 12% of the province's total population. These mountainous areas are generally sparsely populated, cultivation is rough, natural disasters are frequent and severe, and the majority of farmers have not yet been organized. How can the prefectural-level farmers' newspapers, based on these characteristics, guide and inspire mountain farmers to struggle for the realization of the national general task and the construction of a socialist mountainous region? This is an issue worthy of attention.

    On June 8th, the Sichuan Daily, in a newspaper work commentary entitled "Attaching Importance to the Propaganda of Socialist Transformation of Mountain Agriculture," offered some beneficial suggestions on how prefectural-level farmers' newspapers should carry out propaganda in this area.

    "Can the mountains reach socialism?" This is a question that many mountain farmers, and some cadres in the mountains, have not yet resolved or fully resolved. The propaganda of the general line has broadened the horizons of mountain farmers, but due to historical reasons and the limitations of natural conditions, various economic undertakings in the mountainous areas are underdeveloped, and mountain farmers still have some doubts about the prospects for development in the mountainous areas. Therefore, the commentary emphasizes that farmers' newspapers should first pay attention to publicizing love for the mountains to the farmers, using practical examples to illustrate the development prospects of the mountains, and helping farmers establish confidence in building a socialist mountainous area, rather than being limited to simply reporting specific agricultural activities. The Tongchuan Newspaper, in an article entitled "Recognize the Beautiful Future, Grasp the Characteristics, and Strive to Build a Socialist Mountain Area," used vivid facts to describe the treasures of Tongjiang, the development prospects of Tongjiang's agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry, and the huge support for national construction. This plays a role in enhancing people's enthusiasm and confidence in building the mountainous area.

    The prefectural-level farmers' newspapers should concretely point out the path to building a socialist mountainous area through propaganda on mutual aid and cooperation. This is to educate farmers to realize that changing the backward face of the mountainous area mainly relies on the power of their own organization, and cannot simply rely on national assistance. The commentary cited a report from the Wanxian Newspaper, "Why Aren't the Tung Flowers Blooming Yet?" as an example. The report described how farmers in an ordinary mountain village worked individually in the past, and due to insufficient labor, they had to leave land uncultivated every year. This year, the entire village organized eighteen mutual aid groups, and completed the excavation of the entire village's cornfields in one month. This concretely points out a path to the people. Of course, newspapers should also not neglect to publicize the state's multi-faceted assistance to the mountainous areas, so that mountain farmers can understand that the state cares about and attaches importance to the mountainous areas; with the development of the entire national construction, mountain farmers will receive more assistance.

    The prefectural-level farmers' newspapers should also select typical examples to reflect the increasingly developing face of mountain production and the gradual improvement of farmers' lives, so that mountain farmers can see the great improvement of their lives in the future from the small improvements in their lives today, thereby strengthening the people's trust in the Communist Party and the People's Government, and enhancing the confidence of mountain farmers in building a new life. The commentary criticized the erroneous views of some newspaper staff who believed that "the new atmosphere in the mountainous areas is not prominent and not attractive," and pointed out that newspapers should get closer to life. For example, the Wanxian Newspaper, in a report entitled "The Changes Brought by Mutual Aid Groups to Zaomu Cao," quoted farmers' mountain songs to describe the face of Zaomu Cao before liberation: "Barren hillsides, chaotic stone pits, planting without harvest in Zaomu Cao, the Chen family landlords raise pigs and sheep, we farmers eat grass." Now, Zaomu Cao has organized mutual aid groups, renovated the land, and reaps bumper harvests every year. The thirty people, young and old, in Cao have enough to eat and wear, and sold 750 jin of surplus grain to the state last year. When a demobilized soldier from a nearby village returned home, he said in surprise, "I simply can't recognize that this is the original Zaomu Cao." What an inspiring new atmosphere! Changes like this can be seen everywhere in the mountainous areas, but newspapers have rarely reflected them in the past, and they need to be publicized more in the future.

    The opinions put forward in this newspaper work commentary by the Sichuan Daily are worth referring to by the farmers' newspapers of various prefectures in Sichuan, and are also worth referring to by the farmers' newspapers of various prefectures in other regions. (Wan Chun)

    用社会主义光芒照耀山区农民
    在四川，有广大的山区。山区耕地面积约占全省耕地面积的百分之十六强，人口约占全省人口百分之十二强。这些山区一般是地广人稀，耕作粗糙，自然灾害多而严重，多数农民尚未组织起来。专区的农民报纸如何根据这些特点来指导和鼓舞山区农民为实现国家总任务、建设社会主义的山区而斗争，是一个值得重视的问题。
    六月八日，四川日报在题为“重视对山区农业进行社会主义改造的宣传”的报纸工作述评中，就对专区的农民报纸如何进行这方面的宣传，提出了一些有益的意见。
    “山区能不能到社会主义”，这是山区许多农民，也是山区某些干部还没有解决或没有完全解决的问题。经过总路线的宣传，打开了山区农民的眼界，但由于历史的原因和自然条件的限制，山区的各项经济事业不发达，山区农民对山区发展的前途，在认识上还有一些疑虑。因此，述评强调农民报纸应首先注意对农民进行热爱山区的宣传，用实际事例说明山区的发展前途，帮助农民树立起建设社会主义山区的信心，而不应该局限于单纯报道具体的农事活动。通川报在题为“认清美好前途，抓住特点，为建设社会主义的山区而斗争”一文中，就曾用生动的事实描述了通江的宝藏，通江的农业、牧业、林业的发展前途和对国家建设的巨大支援。这在提高人们建设山区的热情和信心方面，是有作用的。
    专区的农民报纸，应通过关于互助合作宣传，具体地指出建设社会主义山区的道路。这就是要教育农民认识，改变山区的落后面貌，主要是依靠自己组织起来的力量，而不能单纯依赖国家的援助。述评引用了万县报的一篇报道“桐子花怎么还不开呀”为例。报道中叙述山区一个普通村庄的农民往年单干，由于劳动力不足，每年都要荒地，今年全村组织了十八个互助组，一个月就挖完了全村的苞谷地。这就具体地向人们指出了一条道路。当然，报纸也不可忽视宣传国家对山区多方面的援助，让山区农民了解国家是关心山区和重视山区的；随着整个国家建设的发展，山区农民将得到更多的援助。
    专区的农民报纸还应选择典型事例，反映山区生产的日益发展和农民生活逐步改善的面貌，使山区农民从今天生活的小改善，看到明天生活的大改善，从而增强了人民对共产党和人民政府的信赖，增强了山区农民建设新生活的信心。述评批判了某些报纸工作人员认为“山区新气象不突出，不吸引人”等错误观点，指出报纸应该多接近些生活。例如万县报曾在一篇“互助组给枣木槽带来的变化”的报道中，引用农民的山歌叙述解放前枣木槽的面貌：“荒山坡、乱石窖，有种无收枣木槽，陈家地主要猪羊，我们农民吃青草。”如今枣木槽已组织起互助组，整修了土地，年年丰收，槽上大小三十口人有吃有穿，去年还卖给国家七百五十斤余粮。附近村上转业军人刚回家时惊喜地说：“我简直认不出这是原来的枣木槽了。”这是何等令人振奋的新气象！像这样的变化在山区是到处可见到的，可是过去报纸却反映得很少，今后需要多加宣传。
    四川日报这篇报纸工作述评所提出的意见，是值得四川各专区农民报纸参考的，也是值得各地的专区农民报纸参考的。　（万春）
