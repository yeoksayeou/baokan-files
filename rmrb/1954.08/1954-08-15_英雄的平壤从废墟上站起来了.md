    Heroic Pyongyang Rises from the Ruins

    On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the liberation of Korea, the heroic city of Pyongyang officially announced that it had risen from the ruins. The six grand construction projects of People's Army Road and Stalin Avenue, which run through the central area of Pyongyang, Kim Il-sung Square and Moranbong Theater located in the central area of Pyongyang, and Mao Zedong Square and Moranbong Stadium in the western district, have all been completed. This is a glorious victory achieved by tens of thousands of working people in Pyongyang under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Republic government, after more than two months of enthusiastic and selfless labor, overcoming numerous difficulties. A grand completion ceremony for the six major projects was held solemnly at 6 p.m. on the 12th. At the intersection of People's Army Road and Stalin Avenue, the area was packed with people. Tens of thousands of workers, students, staff, soldiers, and citizens who participated in the labor competition for the six major projects, holding large banners, national flags of China, the Soviet Union, and Korea, portraits of leaders, and various colored flags, gathered in front of a temporary grandstand to warmly celebrate the achievements of collective labor. When the Korean party and government leaders, headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung, stepped onto the rostrum, thunderous applause and cheers erupted from the audience. Diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries stationed in Korea, as well as experts and technicians from various countries who came to Korea to assist in the restoration and construction, were also invited to attend the ceremony.

    At the meeting, Kim Seung-hwa, Chairman of the State Construction Committee of Korea, delivered a summary report on the six major projects. He thanked all the workers, students, staff, Korean People's Army, and Chinese People's Volunteer Army engineering units who participated in the Pyongyang city construction projects. He said: The achievements we have made prove that the prospects for the restoration and reconstruction of Pyongyang are infinitely beautiful. This achievement also infinitely encourages all the Korean people to strive to complete the Three-Year Plan for the recovery and development of the national economy after the war. This achievement is also a huge demonstration against the US-Li clique in South Korea, who are frantically clamoring for war. He finally wished the people of Pyongyang greater achievements in future restoration and reconstruction. Subsequently, the meeting read out the decision of the Pyongyang City Restoration and Reconstruction Committee on summarizing the previous stage of reconstruction work in Pyongyang, and announced the results of the "August 15th" labor competition award.

    After the meeting, Marshal Kim Il-sung, amid the cheers of the crowd, cut the ribbon at the six major project areas in sequence.

    In the evening, the lights on Stalin Avenue were bright, the traffic flowed like water, and the sidewalks on both sides were filled with people's songs and laughter. The state-run Central Department Store was more crowded than usual. People everywhere were talking about the completion of the six major projects, and everyone said: Pyongyang's appearance has been completely renewed.

    英雄的平壤从废墟上站起来了
    在朝鲜解放九周年前夕，英雄城平壤正式宣告从废墟上站了起来。纵贯平壤中心区的人民军路和斯大林大街、位于平壤中心区的金日成广场和牡丹峰剧场、西区的毛泽东广场和牡丹峰运动场六项宏大的修建工程已全部竣工。这是平壤市数以万计的劳动人民在朝鲜劳动党中央和共和国政府的直接领导下经过两个多月热火朝天的忘我劳动，战胜重重困难而取得的辉煌胜利。十二日下午六时隆重地举行了六大工程的竣工典礼。在人民军路和斯大林大街交接的路口，挤得人山人海，参加六大工程劳动竞赛的工人、学生、职员、军人和市民的数万名劳动大军高举着大幅标语、朝苏中三国国旗和领袖像以及各种彩色旗帜，聚集在一个临时构筑的主席台前，热烈庆祝集体劳动的成果。当以金日成元帅为首的朝鲜党政领袖走上主席台时，全场响起了春雷般的掌声和欢呼声。苏联、中国和其他各人民民主国家驻朝鲜外交使节和各国来朝鲜协助恢复建设的专家、技术人员也应邀参加了典礼。
    会上，由朝鲜国家建设委员会委员长金承化做了关于六大工程的总结报告。他向参加平壤市修建工程的全体工人、学生、职员、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军工兵部队致谢。他说：我们所取得的成就证实着平壤市恢复重建的远景是无限美丽的，这个成就同时无限地鼓舞全体朝鲜人民为完成战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划而奋斗，这个成就也是对正在疯狂叫嚣战争的南朝鲜美、李匪帮的一个巨大的示威。他最后预祝平壤市人民在今后恢复重建中取得更大的成就。接着，会上宣读了平壤市恢复重建委员会关于总结平壤市前一阶段重建工作的决定，宣布了“八·一五”劳动竞赛运动的评奖结果。
    会后，金日成元帅在群众欢呼声中依次到六大工程地区剪彩。
    入晚，斯大林大街上灯光通明，车如流水，两旁的人行道上洋溢着人们的歌声和欢笑声，国营中央百货商店比往日更形拥挤。人们到处谈论着六大工程竣工的事，大家都说：平壤的面貌已焕然一新了。
