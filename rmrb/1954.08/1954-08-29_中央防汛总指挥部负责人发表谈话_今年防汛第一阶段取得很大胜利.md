Xinhua News Agency, August 28th.

    The head of the Central Flood Control Headquarters, in a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters, discussed the victory achieved in the first stage of flood control this year. He said: This flood season is very different from previous years. Due to special meteorological conditions, from January to July this year, except for March when rainfall was relatively low in most parts of the country, rainfall in the remaining six months in most areas south of 40 degrees north latitude was higher than normal, with the Yangtze and Huai River basins being the most severely affected. This year, not only was there more rain, but it also fell heavily and lasted for a long time. Thanks to the thorough preparations, effective organization, and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the long-term hard work of all flood control personnel, and the concerted support of the people across the country, many of our famous cities stand firm in the face of unprecedented high flood levels, and large areas of farmland crops are growing safely, playing a certain guarantee role in the country's socialist construction. It should be affirmed that the achievements in flood control work are significant.

    He then analyzed the water situation this year. He said: This year's floods are not limited to China. According to available materials, countries such as Japan, India, Nepal, Burma, Pakistan, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia have all experienced the worst floods in decades, and the southeastern United States has also experienced major floods. China's Yangtze and Huai River basins have experienced the worst floods in a century. The rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River from April to July this year was more than twice the rainfall in the same period in previous years, and exceeded the average annual rainfall in previous years. The high water level of the Han River this year is also an important factor in raising the water level of the Yangtze River, especially the water level of Wuhan. In addition, the Han River and the rivers in Sichuan Province experienced extraordinarily large floods at the same time and continuously, causing the water levels at all stations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to generally exceed the highest water levels in previous years for a long time. The above situation is the reason for the rise, long duration, wide range, extraordinarily high peak, and extraordinarily large volume of floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River this year. The Huai River basin began to experience continuous rainstorms in early July, with most rainstorms concentrated in the main stream of the Huai River and the Suxian area of northern Anhui. The flood was sudden and large, which was also unprecedented in recent decades.

    Next, the head of the Central Flood Control Headquarters analyzed the water situation in our country's history, pointing out the great significance of our struggle against the floods this time. He said: Since the hydrological records of the Yangtze River, there have been four extraordinarily large floods in 1896, 1931, 1949, and this year. The water levels at most stations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River this year have exceeded the previous three times. The highest water level in Hankou in 1896 was 26.14 meters, the highest water level in 1931 was 28.28 meters, the highest water level in 1949 was 27.12 meters, and the highest water level this year reached 29.73 meters. The highest water level in Yichang in 1896 was 55.94 meters, the highest water level in 1931 was 55.02 meters, the highest water level in 1949 was 54.32 meters, but the highest water level this year reached 55.73 meters. The highest water level in Shashi in 1931 was 43.52 meters, in 1949 it was 44.49 meters, and the highest water level this year reached 44.66 meters. The flood in the Huai River this year greatly exceeded that in 1950, and also exceeded that in 1931. Taking Zhengyangguan as an example, it was 24.62 meters in 1931, 24.77 meters in 1950, and the highest water level this year reached 26.41 meters. It was 20.41 meters in Bengbu in 1931, 21.19 meters in 1950, and the highest water level this year reached 22.14 meters.

    Even under such historically high water levels, our flood control personnel defended many dikes and protected the safety of many important towns. In 1931, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the water level in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River rose sharply, and the highest water level in Hankou was 28.28 meters; but when it reached 26.94 meters, which was 2.79 meters lower than the Wuhan Customs water level in Hankou on August 18, Hankou was flooded. From the beginning of July to the end of October that year, Hankou was submerged in water for nearly four months, with the water depth on the ground ranging from five to seven feet. Nanjing was also submerged in floods for a long time that year. Today, we still hold Wuhan and Nanjing. Other cities are also persisting in the struggle. The people of Wuhan have been fighting the flood that is higher than the highest water level in history for more than a month, and cities such as Nanjing and Huangshi have been fighting the high water level for more than a month. In 1931, the people in the Huai River area suffered the same fate as Hankou. In that year, floods spread across the Huai River basin, breaking the Jinpu Railway and the dikes of the Subei Canal. Floods rushed down from Henan and Anhui, and the plains of northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui were flooded. The flood submerged more than 70 million mu of land in the plains of northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and eastern Henan, affecting a population of more than 17 million. Among them, millions of people were without food, clothing, or shelter, and countless people died of hunger and disease. The flood in the Huai River this year is larger and more fierce than in 1931. Up to now, the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu can still be guaranteed to be safe; the vast plains of northern Anhui have either been spared from disasters or have been mitigated, and the Jinpu Railway is guaranteed to be open to traffic. The Bengbu and Huainan mining areas are both safe. This shows that in the period of reactionary rule, natural disasters plus man-made disasters would bring heavy losses and misfortunes to the people, but under the leadership of the People's Government, although natural disasters are serious, because we wholeheartedly serve the people and take a series of effective measures, the harm of disasters to the people is greatly reduced.

    The floods around Tianjin also exceeded those in 1939. In 1939, the city of Tianjin was flooded. This year, thanks to the flood diversion project of the Duliu Reduction River, the flood storage project of the Guanting Reservoir, and the active defense of the people, Tianjin has not been flooded so far, and the water levels of various rivers have begun to fall.

    At present, more than 60% of the farmland in the flood-stricken areas across the country has drained the accumulated water. The weather in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin has turned sunny, and the rainfall has been greatly reduced compared with the previous period. In order not to miss the farming season, the farmers in the disaster areas, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, have comprehensively and intensively launched drainage, replanting, and changing planting, implementing the policy of planting one season is one season, and harvesting one harvest is one harvest, striving to ensure that the disaster areas do not reduce production or reduce production less, the lightly affected areas do not reduce production and complete the plan, and the non-disaster areas overfulfill the plan to make up for the loss of production in the disaster areas and support the country's economic construction.

    The head of the Flood Control Headquarters pointed out: The reason why the first stage of flood control this year can achieve such a victory is first and foremost due to the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government. Secondly, the local Party and government leading organs, a large number of cadres and commanders and fighters of the troops, have demonstrated a high degree of responsibility to the people, organizing and leading the broad masses of people to carry out heroic flood control and rescue operations. The biggest feature of this flood control and rescue work is that the people in the flood-stricken areas have demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary heroism and patriotism, not afraid of difficulties and dangers, and tenacious struggle, demonstrating the iron will of the people of New China to conquer nature, thus creating many miraculous victories. At the same time, the nationwide unity and mutual assistance of "what you need, we will support," and the valuable behavior of sharing weal and woe, ensure that the flood control work has inexhaustible human and material resources, which plays a great guarantee role in the flood control and rescue work, and also demonstrates the strong overall concept of the people of New China, united closely like a harmonious big family for common happiness and struggling to overcome the floods. Now, millions of flood control personnel on the thousands of miles of dikes are still stubbornly persisting in the struggle, and the flood control materials supported by various places continue to be transported to the flood control areas.

    Again, the various water conservancy projects built in recent years have played a flood control role under this year's extraordinary floods. The Huai River management projects have fully played their planned benefits under this year's extraordinary floods, and many projects have not yet been completed or have not yet started this year, so many completed projects have over-fulfilled the flood control tasks. The upstream reservoirs such as Shiman Beach, Banqiao, Baisha, and Boshan have weakened the upstream flood peaks to the downstream's ability to bear the flow three or four times or six or seven times, preventing floods from overflowing. The Foziling Reservoir intercepted the flood of the Pi River, and the downstream discharge of the reservoir was reduced to 600 cubic meters per second, ensuring the safe growth of more than 700,000 mu of autumn crops on both sides of the Pi River. The depressions and flood storage lakes in the middle reaches have also intercepted a large amount of floodwater, greatly reducing the danger of dikes and flood disasters in the middle and lower reaches. In the downstream, the completion of the Sanhe Sluice, Gaoliangjian Inlet Sluice, and the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, which also undertakes the task of drainage into the sea, enables the Huai River flood to be discharged in a planned manner. It plays a decisive role in protecting the safety of 25 million mu of land in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu. The Jingjiang flood diversion project, the Guanting Reservoir, the Duliu Reduction River and other water conservancy projects have played their due roles. In addition, the People's Government actively and proactively adopted flood diversion and storage methods under the principle of subordinating small interests to large interests and subordinating partial interests to overall interests, and properly resettled the people in the flood storage areas in safe areas in advance, and planned to subsidize the disaster-stricken people in the flood storage areas, which played a major role in protecting cities, relieving the danger of certain cities such as Wuhan, and protecting the vast farmland.

    The head of the Central Flood Control Headquarters finally pointed out: At present, the weather is improving and the climate is gradually turning to normal. Except for the development of the water situation in individual areas, the overall water situation is tending to be stable, which is a good aspect; however, the water levels of rivers and lakes are not falling quickly, the dike body has been immersed in water for too long, the dike body is softening, and the flood resistance is reduced. In addition, the cadres, commanders, fighters, and the vast number of flood control personnel have persisted in the struggle for a long time and are physically fatigued, which increases the difficulty of the current flood control work. These difficulties must be fully recognized and estimated. According to past experience, the possibility of breaches occurring during the retreat period is very high. We must make persistent efforts, continue to display a high degree of revolutionary heroism and patriotism, consolidate the achievements we have made, and fight against possible complacency, and strive for the final victory over the floods. In areas where the water has receded, we must promptly lead farmers to vigorously restore production; in areas where the accumulated water cannot be withdrawn temporarily, we must vigorously lead the victims to carry out organized and planned production and self-help, and pay attention to protecting draft cattle. In non-disaster areas, we must earnestly complete the plan for over-increased production. All localities should complete this work as a serious local political task. We must have such confidence that we can not only overcome the floods, but also overcome some of the temporary difficulties brought to us by the floods.

    中央防汛总指挥部负责人发表谈话
    今年防汛第一阶段取得很大胜利
    【新华社二十八日讯】中央防汛总指挥部负责人就今年防汛第一阶段所取得的胜利，对新华社记者发表谈话。他说：今年汛期和往年大不相同，由于气象上的特殊情况，今年一月到七月除了三月份全国大部分地区比较少雨外，其余六个月，在北纬四十度以南，国内绝大部分地区，雨量都比常年为多，其中以长江、淮河流域一带为严重。今年雨水不仅多，而且下得大，持续时间久。由于中国共产党和人民政府准备周全，组织有方，领导正确，全体防汛工作人员长期的艰苦斗争，全国人民同心协力的支援，使我们许多著名城市屹立在空前高的洪水位面前，大片的农田作物，获得安全生长，对国家的社会主义建设起了一定的保证作用。应该肯定，防汛工作成绩是很大的。
    接着他分析今年的水情。他说：今年大水不仅限于中国，据现有的材料看，日本、印度、尼泊尔、缅甸、巴基斯坦、德国、奥地利、瑞典、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克等国家，都发生了几十年来未有的大水，美国东南部也发生了大水。我国长江、淮河流域发生了百年来未有的大水。今年长江中、下游从四月到七月连续四个月的降雨量，竟达到历年同期雨量的两倍多，并且超过历年平均年雨量。今年汉水大，也是抬高长江水位，特别是武汉水位的重要因素。加之汉水和川水同时连续发生特大洪水，使长江中、下游各站普遍超过历年最高水位时间很久。上述情况就是今年长江中、下游洪水起涨、持续时间长、范围广、涨峰特高和水量特大的情况。淮河流域是在七月初开始连续暴雨的，暴雨多集中在淮河干流和淮北宿县地区。洪水猛而大，亦为近数十年来不曾有过的。
    接着，中央防汛总指挥部负责人从我国历史上的水情进行分析，指出这次我们和洪水搏斗的重大意义。他说：长江有水文记载以来，共发生过一八九六年、一九三一年、一九四九年和今年四次特大洪水。今年长江中、下游各站水位大部分都超过以往三次。汉口一八九六年最高水位是二六点一四公尺，一九三一年最高水位是二八点二八公尺，一九四九年最高水位是二七点一二公尺，今年最高水位达到二九点七三公尺。宜昌一八九六年的最高水位是五五点九四公尺，一九三一年的最高水位是五五点零二公尺，一九四九年的最高水位是五四点三二公尺，今年最高水位却高达五五点七三公尺。沙市一九三一年最高水位是四三点五二公尺，一九四九年是四四点四九公尺，今年最高水位达到四四点六六公尺。淮河今年的洪水，大大超过了一九五零年，而且也超过了一九三一年。以正阳关来看，一九三一年是二四点六二公尺，一九五零年是二四点七七公尺，今年最高水位达到二六点四一公尺。蚌埠一九三一年是二零点四一公尺，一九五零年是二一点一九公尺，今年最高水位达到二二点一四公尺。
    即使在这样历史上最高水位下，我们的防汛工作人员坚守了许多堤防和保卫了不少重要城镇的安全。一九三一年，在国民党反动统治时期，长江中下游水位高涨，汉口的最高水位是二八点二八公尺；但是在达到二六点九四公尺的时候，也就是比八月十八日汉口武汉关水位低二点七九公尺时，汉口就被淹了。从那一年七月初到十月下旬，汉口被浸在水里将近四个月，平地水深五尺到七尺。当年南京也长期被浸在洪水中。今天，我们仍然把武汉市南京市坚守住了。其他城市也在坚持斗争中。武汉市人民已和高出历史上最高水位的洪水搏斗了一个多月，南京、黄石等市已经和高水位搏斗了一个多月。一九三一年淮河地区人民，同样遭到和汉口的境遇。那一年，洪水曾在淮河流域全面泛滥成灾，冲断了津浦铁路，冲破了苏北运河堤防。洪水从河南、安徽直冲而下，苏皖平原一片汪洋。洪水淹去苏北、皖北和豫东平原七千多万亩土地，受灾人口达一千七百多万。其中缺衣无食无家可归的有好几百万人，因饥饿害病而死的无可计数。今年淮河洪水比
  一九三一年大而猛，苏北里下河地区到现在为止，仍能保证安全；淮北广大平原，有的免除了灾害，有的减轻了灾害，并保证津浦铁路通车。蚌埠和淮南矿区都确保安全。这就说明，在反动统治时期，天灾加上人祸，任何自然灾害，都会带给人民惨重的损失和不幸，但在人民政府领导下，尽管自然灾害严重，由于我们忠心耿耿的为人民服务，采取了一系列的有效措施，灾害对人民的危害就大大减轻。
    天津周围的洪水，也超过了一九三九年。在一九三九年，天津市内曾被洪水所淹。今年因为有了独流减河的分洪工程、官厅水库的蓄洪工程以及人民群众的积极防守，所以天津到现在未遭水淹，而各河水位已经开始下落。
    目前，全国受涝地区已有百分之六十以上的农田排除了积水。长江中下游和淮河流域地区天气转晴，降雨较前大大减少，为了不误农时，水灾地区农民在党和政府的领导下，互助合作组织的带动下，全面而紧张地展开了排涝补种、改种，贯彻多种一季是一季，多收一成是一成的方针，力争灾区不减产或少减产，轻灾区不减产和完成计划，非灾区超额完成计划，以弥补灾区减产损失和支援国家经济建设。
    防汛总指挥部负责人指出：今年防汛第一阶段所以能取得这样的胜利，首先应归功中共中央和中央人民政府的领导正确。其次是当地党、政领导机关，大批干部和部队指战员发挥了高度向人民负责的精神，组织和领导广大人民进行英勇的防汛抢险。这次防汛抢险工作中的最大特点是，水灾地区人民发挥了高度的革命英雄主义和爱国主义的精神，不畏艰险，顽强斗争，表现了新中国人民人定胜天的钢铁意志，因而创造了许许多多的胜利奇迹。同时，全国人民同心协力的“要什么，支援什么”的团结互助，患难共度的可贵行为，保证了防汛工作有取之不尽、用之不竭的人力和物力，对防汛抢险工作起了极大的保证作用，也表现了新中国人民坚强的整体观念，为了共同幸福，像一个和睦的大家庭一样，紧密团结，为战胜洪水而斗争。现在，千里堤防上数百万防汛工作人员仍在顽强地坚持斗争，各地支援的防汛器材继续不断地运往防汛地区。
    再次，是几年来所修的各项水利工程，在今年特大洪水下发挥了防洪作用。治淮工程在今年特大洪水下，都充分发挥了它们的计划效益，还有不少工程今年尚未完成或尚未动工，因而许多已完的工程超额担负了防洪任务。上游的石漫滩、板桥、白沙和薄山等水库，曾三四次或六七次地把上游洪峰削弱到下游能承担的流量，防止了洪水漫溢。佛子岭水库拦蓄了淠河洪水，水库下泄流量减到每秒钟六百公方，保障了淠河两岸七十多万亩秋庄稼安全生长。中游的洼地、蓄洪湖泊，也都拦蓄了大量洪水，大大减轻了中、下游堤防危险和洪水灾害。下游由于完成了三河闸、高良涧进水闸和兼负排水入海任务的苏北灌溉总渠等工程，使淮河洪水能有计划下泄。对保护苏北里下河二千五百万亩土地的安全，起了决定作用。荆江分洪工程，官厅水库、独流减河等水利工程，都发挥了应有的作用。加上人民政府在小利服从大利，局部服从整体的原则下，积极主动地采取分洪和蓄洪的办法，并在事先将蓄洪区人民妥善地安置在安全地区，有计划地补助蓄洪区的受灾群众，对于保卫城市，解除某些城市如武汉市的险情以及对于保卫广大农田都起了重大的作用。
    中央防汛总指挥部负责人最后指出：目前天气好转，气候逐渐转向正常，除个别地区水情发展外，总的水情趋向平稳，这是好的方面；但是江河湖泊水位下泄不快，堤身浸水过久，堤身发软，抗洪力减低，加之干部、指战员和广大防汛工作人员坚持斗争日久，身体疲劳，这些都增加目前防汛工作的困难，必须充分认识和估计这些困难。根据以往的经验，在退水时期发生溃决的可能性是很大的。必须再接再厉，继续发挥高度的革命英雄主义和爱国主义精神，巩固已得的成绩，并和可能产生的麻痹思想进行斗争，为争取最后战胜洪水而斗争。在已经退水的地区，要及时领导农民大力恢复生产；在积水暂时尚不能退出的地区，要大力领导灾民进行有组织有计划地生产自救工作，注意保护耕牛。在非灾区要切实完成超额增产计划。各地要把这一工作作为当地严重的政治任务来完成。我们要具有这样的信心，不仅能战胜洪水，而且能战胜洪水带给我们的某些暂时的困难。
