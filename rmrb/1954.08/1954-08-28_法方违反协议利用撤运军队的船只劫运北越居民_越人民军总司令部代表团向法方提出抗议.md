Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, August 27th: According to the Vietnam News Agency North Vietnam dispatch of the 25th, the French side is using landing craft, agreed upon by both the French and Vietnamese sides for the withdrawal of French troops, to kidnap North Vietnamese residents to South Vietnam.

The delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, participating in the Local Joint Armistice Commission in North Vietnam, agreed on August 5th that the French side could use one tank landing craft and four medium landing craft via the Thai Binh River to withdraw their troops from Dong Xuyen, Jian'an Province, North Vietnam, to their temporary assembly areas, in order to facilitate this withdrawal by the French Federal forces.

The French side seized this opportunity and used two tank landing craft and eleven medium landing craft to kidnap Catholic residents of Dong Xuyen to South Vietnam. The French side dispatched two companies of troops to surround Dong Xuyen, searching house to house, forcing residents to sign "voluntary" agreements to go to South Vietnam. Those who refused to sign were beaten and had to pay three thousand piastres each to gain their freedom. They forcibly moved the residents' luggage onto the ships first, and then forced the residents to board. In this way, some families were deprived of all their property. A total of one hundred and eighty Catholic households, comprising six hundred and fifty-nine people, were forcibly transported away by the French Federal forces, in addition to thirty-seven water buffalo.

The delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, participating in the Local Joint Armistice Commission in North Vietnam, has protested to the French side regarding this act of seriously violating the freedom and democratic rights of residents, and violating the terms of the armistice agreement and the bilateral agreement. They also suggested sending a mobile team to investigate the incident, but the French side rejected this suggestion with all possible excuses.

    法方违反协议利用撤运军队的船只劫运北越居民
    越人民军总司令部代表团向法方提出抗议
    【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十五日讯：法国方面利用法越双方协议用来撤运法方军队的登陆艇，劫运北越居民到南越去。
    参加北越地方联合停战委员会的越南人民军总司令部代表团，为了便于法兰西联邦部队从北越建安省东川撤往他们的临时集结地区，曾在八月五日同意法方可以使用一艘坦克登陆艇和四艘中型登陆艇经由太平河撤运他们的军队。
    法方抓住这个机会竟使用两艘坦克登陆艇和十一艘中型登陆艇劫运东川的信仰天主教的居民到南越去。法方调了两连军队包围东川，逐户搜索，强迫居民签字“志愿”前往南越。那些不愿签名的人受到殴打，并且必须每人缴纳三千披阿士特才能获得自由。他们硬把居民的行李先搬到船上去，然后强迫居民上船。这样，若干人家被夺去了全部的财产。总计被法兰西联邦部队强迫运走的有一百八十户信仰天主教的居民，共六百五十九人，此外还有三十七头水牛。
    参加北越地方联合停战委员会的越南人民军总司令部代表团已就法方这种严重侵犯居民的自由和民主权利以及违反停战协定和双方协议的条款的行动，向法方提出抗议，并且建议派遣一个机动小组去调查这一事件，但是法方用一切可能的借口拒绝了这个建议。
