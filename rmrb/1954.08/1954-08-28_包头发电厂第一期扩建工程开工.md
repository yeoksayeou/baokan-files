    The first phase of the expansion project and related works of the state-owned Baotou Power Plant commenced on August 16th to meet the growing power needs of Baotou's industry and capital construction. The civil engineering portion of this project is planned to be completed before the ground freezes this year. The entire project will be completed next spring. After the completion of the expansion project of Baotou Power Plant, Baotou's electricity will more than double.

    Preparatory work for the project began as early as six months ago. Now, the material storage sheds and workers' dormitories on the construction site are increasing day by day; bricks, tiles, wood, stone, lime, as well as a large amount of steel and cement, and other main materials are being transported in succession; and construction teams are arriving at the site one after another.

    Before the start of construction, construction workers expressed their determination at a mobilization meeting to work actively and strive for the construction of Baotou's electric power industry. (Guo Equan)

    包头发电厂第一期扩建工程开工
    为了满足包头工业和基本建设日益增长的动力需要，国营包头发电厂的第一期扩建工程和附属工程已于八月十六日开工。这一工程土木部分的施工，计划在今年封冻前完成。全部工程将在明年春季完成。包头发电厂的扩建工程完工后，包头的电力将比现在增加一倍以上。
    工程的筹备工作早在半年前就着手进行。现在，工地上堆放材料的工棚和工人宿舍一天比一天增多；砖、瓦、木、石、白灰以及大量的钢材、水泥等主要材料陆续运来；施工队伍陆续到达现场。
    开工前，建筑工人们在动员大会上纷纷表示决心，一定要积极工作，为包头电力工业建设而努力。　（郭锷权）
