    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 11th: The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued an urgent call on August 10th to Party organizations at all levels throughout the province to quickly mobilize the broad masses of farmers to launch an over-plan production campaign, striving for an increase of about seven catties per mu for the province's 20 million mu of autumn crops beyond the original planned increase, in order to compensate for the agricultural production losses in the flood-affected areas of the Yangtze and Huai River basins and promote the completion of the national agricultural production plan this year.

    The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently studied the favorable conditions for agricultural production in the province in the second half of the year and believes that it is possible to overfulfill the production increase plan. The planting area of mid-season rice, late rice, sweet potatoes, and autumn soybeans and other late-autumn crops in Fujian Province is approximately 60% of the province's crop planting area. Among them, the planting area of mid-season rice and late rice alone reaches more than 15 million mu. The province also has approximately 2 million mu of autumn fallow land that can be used to plant short-term crops such as autumn soybeans, sweet potatoes, buckwheat, mung beans, and melons. The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires Party organizations and rural Communist Party members and Youth League members at all levels to regard striving to overfulfill the agricultural production increase task in the second half of the year by relying on mutual aid and cooperation organizations as the primary political task; actively help existing agricultural production cooperatives tap the potential for increased production in the second half of the year, formulate practical and feasible production increase plans, and mobilize thousands of mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives after the autumn harvest to greet the establishment of cooperatives after the autumn harvest with practical actions to overfulfill this year's grain production increase task; and then, through the production increase activities of these cooperatives and teams, help and drive nearby individual farmers to join this production increase campaign. All localities must actively carry out fertilizer accumulation competitions, increase the amount of fertilizer applied to late-autumn crops, strengthen field management, do a good job in the maintenance and management of the more than 270,000 farmland water conservancy projects built this year and in the past few years, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests of late-autumn crops in a timely manner, as well as prevent wind and beasts, to ensure a bumper autumn harvest.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 11th: The movement to increase grain production by 1.49 billion catties above the target in non-disaster areas of Anhui Province is vigorously unfolding. This movement is based on mutual aid and cooperative organizations. More than 120 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 28,000 mutual aid teams in the three counties of Lu'an, Jinzhai, and Huoqiu in the Lu'an Special District are leading individual farmers to interplant corn, mung beans, and other late-autumn crops on more than 115,000 mu of soybean and sweet potato fields. Farmers in five counties, including Shucheng and Feixi, used the method of "dividing late rice seedlings" to plant more than 38,000 mu of late rice. More than 7.2 million mu of rice in the entire special district has been hoed three to four times, one more time than in previous years; among them, late rice is being top-dressed with fertilizer. According to incomplete statistics from the three special districts of Anqing, Wuhu, and Lu'an, as of August 6th, more than 1.28 million mu of wasteland had been reclaimed and vacant land and fallow fields had been utilized to expand the planting of late-autumn crops. Farmers in various places are doing their best to reclaim and sow at the same time. Mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the Chuxian Special District are also leading farmers to minimize fallow fields, plant late-autumn crops, and plan to cultivate ratooning rice. Farmers in Feidong County alone plan to cultivate 150,000 mu of ratooning rice.

    In order to support the movement to increase grain production above the target in non-disaster areas, the Anhui Provincial Agricultural and Grain Departments have rapidly transferred seeds collected within the province and a large number of seeds supported from outside the province to various places. The People's Bank of China and the cooperative system have also prepared a large amount of loans and more than 100 million catties of various fertilizers, which are being rapidly supplied to farmers.

    福建省动员农民开展超计划增产粮食运动
    安徽省非灾区超额增产粮食运动蓬勃展开
   【新华社福州十一日电】中共福建省委员会在八月十日紧急号召全省各级党组织迅速动员广大农民开展超计划增产运动，力争全省两千万亩秋季作物比原订增产计划每亩多增产七斤左右，以弥补长江、淮河流域等遭受涝灾地区农业减产的损失，促进今年全国农业生产计划的完成。
    中共福建省委员会最近研究了全省下半年农业生产的有利条件，认为超额完成增产计划是可能的。福建省中稻、晚稻、甘薯和秋大豆等晚秋作物种植面积，约等于全省农作物种植面积的百分之六十。其中中稻和晚稻种植面积即达一千五百多万亩。全省还有约二百万亩秋闲地，可以利用种植秋大豆、甘薯、荞麦、绿豆和瓜类等短期作物。中共福建省委员会要求各级党组织和农村共产党员、青年团员，把依靠互助合作组织力争在下半年内超计划完成农业增产任务，作为当前的首要政治任务；积极帮助现有农业生产合作社挖掘下半年增产潜力，订出切实可行的增产计划，并发动成千上万个准备秋后办社的互助组以超计划完成今年粮食增产任务的实际行动来迎接秋后办社；再通过这些社、组的增产活动，分别帮助和带动附近单干农民一同投入这一增产运动。各地必须积极开展积肥竞赛，增加晚秋作物的施肥量和加强田间管理，做好今年和过去几年兴修的二十七万多处农田水利工程的养护和管理，及时防治晚秋作物的病虫害和防风、防兽等，确保秋季丰收。
   【新华社合肥十一日电】安徽省非灾区超额增产十四亿九千万斤粮食的运动正蓬勃展开。这个运动是以互助合作组织为基础的。六安专区的六安、金寨、霍邱三县一百二十多个农业生产合作社和两万八千多个互助组带动单干农民，在豆田、山芋田里间种玉米、绿豆等晚秋作物十一万五千多亩。舒城、肥西等五县农民用“晚稻分棵”的办法，多栽了三万八千多亩晚稻。全专区七百二十多万亩水稻已锄过三遍到四遍，比往年多锄了一遍；其中晚稻正在施用追肥。据安庆、芜湖、六安三个专区的不完全统计，到八月六日为止，已开垦荒地和利用空白地、休闲田共一百二十八万多亩，以扩大播种晚秋作物。各地农民多做到边开垦边播种。滁县专区的互助合作组织也带动农民尽量减少休闲田，种植晚秋作物，并计划培育再生稻。仅肥东县农民就计划培育再生稻十五万亩。
    为了支持非灾区农民的超额增产粮食运动，安徽省农业、粮食部门已把省内筹集的种籽和省外支援的大批种籽急速调运各地。人民银行和合作社系统也准备了大量贷款和各种肥料一亿多万斤，正在迅速供应给农民。
