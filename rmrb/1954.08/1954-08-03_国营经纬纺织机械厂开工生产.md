The first modern textile machinery manufacturing plant in our country—the state-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory—officially began production on August 1st. On this day, the entire factory was filled with joy. Hundreds of colorful flags and large banners adorned the inside and outside of the factory with a festive atmosphere. All the factory workers solemnly held a commencement ceremony on this day. At around 10:00 a.m., Jiang Guangnai, Minister of the Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, cut the ribbon amidst warm applause. The deafening sound of machines and the cheers of the masses immediately intertwined. Carding machines, drawing frames, roving frames, and spinning machines, which the assembly workers had rushed to assemble to welcome the official production, were also running for trial operation at this time. From then on, this factory, which can produce equipment for 500,000 spindles annually, will produce a large number of excellent spinning machines to equip our country's newly built textile factories.

In addition to all the factory workers, representatives from textile machinery factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and more than ten factories in Taiyuan, Yuci, and other places that had supported the construction of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory also attended the commencement ceremony. Farmers from Yuci and Taigu counties also sent representatives to participate. At the meeting, Jiang Guangnai, Minister of the Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, Shao Jingwa, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Textile Trade Union, Yu Lin, Minister of the Industry Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Tian Jiesan, representative of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, all spoke. They unanimously pointed out that the completion of the Jingwei Factory has great significance for the development of our country's textile industry. They warmly congratulated all the employees on the victory they achieved in the construction of the factory and encouraged them to achieve greater achievements in production. Zhang Shuanbao, the head of the Nanshahe Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taigu County, also spoke. He also presented gifts such as watermelons and tomatoes produced by his agricultural cooperative to the workers. After awarding more than ninety construction models, the conference unanimously passed congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory broke ground in May 1951. By the end of last year, it had basically completed all factory building construction and equipment installation projects. During the intense factory construction process, it also trained a large number of production personnel and carried out complex new product design and trial production work. It also began small-scale production of 10,000-spindle spinning machines in January of this year. The smooth progress of these tasks has prepared various preparations for the official start of production.

    国营经纬纺织机械厂开工生产
    我国第一座现代化纺织机械制造厂——国营经纬纺织机械厂在八月一日正式开工生产。这一天，整个工厂都呈现着一片欢乐景象。数百面彩旗和大幅标语把工厂内外点缀得喜气洋洋。全厂职工在这一日隆重地举行了开工典礼。上午十时许，中央人民政府纺织工业部部长蒋光鼐在热烈的掌声中剪彩，震耳的机器声和群众欢呼声立刻交织成一片。装配工人们为迎接正式生产赶装出来的梳棉、并条、粗纺和精纺机，这时也都运转起来进行试车了。从此，这座可年产五十万纱锭设备的工厂就将生产出大量优良的纺纱机器，装备我国新建的纺织工厂。
    参加经纬纺织机械制造厂开工生产典礼的除全厂职工外，还有上海、天津、青岛等地的纺织机械厂和太原、榆次等地曾经支援过该厂建设的十多个工厂的代表。榆次和太谷两县农民也派了代表来参加。会上，中央人民政府纺织工业部部长蒋光鼐、中国纺织工会全国委员会副主席邵井蛙、中共山西省委员会工业部部长于林和山西省人民政府代表田杰三等都讲了话。他们一致指出，经纬厂的建成对我国纺织工业的发展有着重大的意义。他们热烈祝贺全体职工在建厂中所取得的胜利，并鼓励他们在生产上取得更大的成就。太谷县南沙河农业生产合作社社长张拴保也讲了话。他并把自己农业合作社生产的西瓜、西红柿等礼物赠送给职工们。大会在对九十多个建厂模范授奖后，一致通过了给毛主席和给中国人民解放军的致敬电。
    经纬纺织机械厂从一九五一年五月破土动工，到去年年底已基本完成全部厂房建筑和设备安装工程；在紧张的建厂过程中还同时培养了大批生产人员，进行了复杂的新产品设计和试制工作，今年一月起并开始了一万纱锭纺纱机的小量生产。这些工作的顺利进行，为正式开工生产做好了各项准备。
