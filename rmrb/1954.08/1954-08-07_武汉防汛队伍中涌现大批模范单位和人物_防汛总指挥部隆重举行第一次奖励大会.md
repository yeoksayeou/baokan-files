    A large number of model units and individuals emerge from Wuhan's flood prevention teams
    Flood Control Headquarters solemnly holds its first award ceremony
    [This newspaper Wuhan 6th dispatch] Wuhan city's comprehensive summer flood prevention work has been underway for more than forty days. Since July 18, when the Wuhan Customs水位 (Shuiwei - water level) exceeded the highest water level in previous years, the flood prevention struggle has entered its most tense and arduous stage. In this sustained and tense struggle, the city's more than 100,000-strong flood prevention army fought the floods day and night, demonstrating unparalleled bravery and tenacity, and a large number of model units and heroic figures emerged.
    On July 29, a serious danger occurred near the Jiang'an Vehicle Depot, with a 30-meter collapse of the dike body. Two companies of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the 6th company of a certain special forces unit, and six units including the Jiang'an Vehicle Depot, immediately assembled more than 1,000 people to the dike for rescue within five minutes. Under the leadership of the responsible comrades of each unit, all personnel, regardless of the gale-force winds and torrential rain and the impact of huge waves, quickly transported sacks filled with bricks and stones and large rocks to reinforce the dike body, finally turning this serious danger into safety. When a dangerous situation occurred at the Yangsi machine dike in Wuchang, two companies of a certain military school of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the command of company commander Li Haizhou, immediately jumped into the water to form a "human wall" to block the wind and waves and protect the dike body; another part of the people quickly reinforced the dike body, safeguarding the safety of the dike. When water seeped out of the ground inside the dike at the Wusheng Road intersection in Hanyang, eight units, including the Xianghe First Work Section, immediately assembled more than 1,600 people to the dangerous area for rescue. Dozens of people sat together on sacks blocking the outlet of the water, preventing the flood from surging upward. At the same time, Tong Ankun (Communist Party member), the captain of the emergency rescue team, led four emergency rescue team members to dive into the deep water to explore the water inlet outside the dike, plugging it with cotton and creating a cofferdam with sacks, before reversing this dangerous situation. When a leak occurred at a certain location on the Zhanggong Dike, the outstanding Communist Party member Luo Guangtian jumped into the water and used his body to block the hole, persisting from eight o'clock in the morning until twelve o'clock, until the sacks were transported from afar to repair the dike body.
    On August 5, the Wuhan Municipal Flood Control Headquarters solemnly held the first award ceremony for flood prevention work, commending and rewarding model units and heroic figures in the city who had performed meritorious service in the flood prevention and emergency rescue struggle. At the award ceremony, Song Kanfu and Li Erzhong, deputy commanders of the Wuhan Municipal Flood Control Headquarters, personally awarded glorious banners to 66 flood prevention units that had collectively performed meritorious service, including units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, excellent units of workers, farmers, government agencies, schools in this city, and farmers from Wuchang and Hanyang counties near Wuhan who participated in flood prevention. The train power station of the North China Electric Power Bureau, which had come from afar to support Wuhan's flood prevention work, also gloriously won the second-class red flag award. The heroic figures who performed meritorious service in emergency rescue at the front line of flood prevention, including military engineers, workers, laborers, technical engineering personnel, and excellent medical personnel serving at the front line of flood prevention, were awarded first-class or second-class merit, and given a circular of commendation.
    The Party Committee and the Youth League Working Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Flood Control Headquarters also approved a group of activists who had performed bravely and resourcefully at the front line of flood prevention to join the Communist Party of China and the New Democratic Youth League at the award ceremony.
    At the time of the award ceremony, the Wuhan Customs水位 (Shuiwei - water level) had risen to 29.15 meters at 7:00 p.m. on the 5th, exceeding the highest water level in previous years by 0.87 meters. All the winning units and the heroic figures who had performed meritorious service unanimously expressed that they would guard against arrogance and rashness, further strengthen the flood prevention and emergency rescue struggle, and lead the city's 100,000-strong flood prevention army to strive to ensure the safety of Wuhan's urban area and finally defeat the floods.

    武汉防汛队伍中涌现大批模范单位和人物
    防汛总指挥部隆重举行第一次奖励大会
    【本报武汉六日电】武汉市全面展开夏季防汛工作已经有四十多天了，从七月十八日武汉关水位超过历年最高水位以后，防汛斗争已进入最紧张而艰苦的阶段。在这持续紧张的斗争中，全市十多万防汛大军日日夜夜地和洪水搏斗，表现了无比英勇顽强的战斗精神，并涌现了大批的模范单位和英雄人物。
    七月二十九日，江岸车辆段附近发生堤身崩塌三十多公尺的严重险情，中国人民解放军某部两个连、某特种兵第六连和江岸车辆段等六个单位，立即在五分钟内集合了一千多人上堤抢救。在各单位负责同志带头下，全体人员不顾狂风暴雨和巨浪的冲击，迅速地搬运盛着砖石的麻包和大石头抢修堤身，终于使这一严重险情转危为安。在武昌杨泗机堤防发生险情时，中国人民解放军某军事学校两个连在连长李海洲指挥下，一部分人立即跳下水去结成一道“人墙”挡住风浪，保护堤身；另一部分人迅速地加固堤身，保卫了堤防的安全。在汉阳五圣路口堤内地面冒水时，襄河第一工段等八个单位立即集合了一千六百多人到险地抢救，几十个人一起坐在堵塞出水口的麻包上，制止了洪水上窜。同时，抢险大队分队长童安坤（共产党员）率领四个抢险队员潜入深水摸索到堤外入水洞口，用棉花堵塞并用麻包作成围井后，才扭转了这个险情。在张公堤某处发生漏洞时，优秀的共产党员罗光田跳下水去用自己的身体将洞堵住，从早晨八点坚持到十二点钟，一直等到麻包从远处运来将堤身修复。
    八月五日，武汉市防汛总指挥部隆重举行防汛工作第一次奖励大会，表扬和奖励全市坚持防汛抢险斗争中立功的模范单位和英雄人物。在奖励大会上，武汉市防汛总指挥部副总指挥宋侃夫、李尔重等亲自把光荣的奖旗授给六十六个集体立功的防汛单位，其中有中国人民解放军部队、有本市的工人、农民、机关、学校和武汉附近武昌、汉阳各县农民参加防汛的优秀单位。远道赶来支援武汉防汛工作的华北电业局列车发电站，也光荣地获得了二等红旗奖。在防汛前线抢险立功的英雄人物，有军工、工人、民工、技术工程人员和在防汛前线服务的优秀的医务人员等四十多人，他们分别记上一等功或二等功，并给以通报表扬。
    中共武汉市防汛总指挥部党委会和青年团工作委员会并在奖励大会上，批准了一批在防汛前线表现英勇机智的积极分子加入中国共产党和新民主主义青年团。
    在奖励大会举行的时候，武汉关水位在五日下午七时已上涨到二九点一五公尺，已经超过历年最高水位零点八七公尺。各个得奖单位和立功的英雄们，一致表示要戒骄戒躁，进一步加强防汛抢险斗争，带动全市十万防汛大军，为确保武汉市区安全、最后战胜洪水而努力。
