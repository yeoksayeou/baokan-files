    A Great Happy Event That the Yi People Have Never Encountered in Generations
    Wu Pao Daqu, Deputy County Magistrate of Mabian County, Sichuan Province (Yi Nationality)
    The Communist Party and Chairman Mao stipulate in the draft constitution that all ethnic groups are equal, discrimination and oppression against any ethnic group are prohibited, regional autonomy is implemented in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, and ethnic minorities are allowed to be masters of their own affairs; help ethnic minorities develop political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings... This is simply something that our Yi people have never dreamed of for thousands of years, a great happy event that our ancestors have never encountered. In fact, looking back, this great happy event has already begun. After the Communist Party and the People's Government came, they did things for us in this way.
    Mabian County in Sichuan Province is on the edge of the Liangshan area, a remote and poor area of ​​the motherland. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the changes in the Yi people in recent years have been exciting and pleasant. In December 1951, the Mabian Nationalities Democratic United Government was established, and our Yi people enjoyed the right to be masters of their own affairs. The Communist Party and the People's Government have trained a large number of Yi cadres for us. Up to now, 137 cadres above the township level have participated in government work to manage the internal affairs of their own ethnic group. The government led Yi and Han cadres and people to study ethnic policies, and held many unity meetings and gatherings in areas where Yi and Han people lived together, resolved many "enemies" and disputes, and promoted unity between and within ethnic groups. A new atmosphere of mutual assistance, love, and mutual respect has emerged between the Yi and Han people. The Yi people deeply feel: Where could this be without the leadership and education of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!
    With the care and help of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the production of the Yi people has been greatly developed, and their lives have been continuously improved. The People's Government has vigorously solved the difficulties in production and life for our Yi people. After the start of spring plowing production last year, during the spring famine and summer famine, the People's Government issued us more than 104,000 jin of corn and 45.88 million yuan in relief funds, solving the food problem for more than 5,000 households; it also distributed 1,654 large and small farm tools and 22.43 million yuan in loans, which solved our production difficulties in a timely manner. When insect and animal disasters seriously threatened production, the People's Government also led us to catch insects and fight animals. Last year, more than 1,300 wild animals were killed, and insect and animal pests were promptly extinguished, protecting the crops. In areas where Yi and Han people live together, Yi-Han labor exchange groups were organized, and Yi people's production groups were also organized. With the help of the production technology guidance station, Yi and Han farmers generally improved their production technology, increasing production by more than 5%. This year, the People's Government continued to issue us more than 257,000 jin of corn, 2.8 million yuan in relief funds, and 3,259 large and small farm tools, and loaned 22.27 million yuan.
    In order to solve the sales of our local specialties and supply us with necessary daily necessities, the People's Government set up state-owned trading company purchase groups in Zoumaping, Xuekoushan, Sanhekou and other places. Last year, it purchased more than 140 million yuan worth of local specialties, and timely supplied us with cheap salt, cloth, thread and other daily necessities. The China Tea Company purchase group purchased 80 million yuan worth of tea in Yuanjiaxi Autonomous Township alone. This year, it continues to purchase local specialties in various places. These have played a great role in improving the lives of the Yi people. In recent years, medical and health and cultural and educational work have also been continuously developed. The People's Government has trained many ethnic health work cadres for us, and established health centers in Zoumaping, Xuekoushan, Fengxi, Sanhekou and other places, and organized a ethnic health work medical team to go deep into the Yi areas to treat our illnesses. Last year, it treated more than 24,000 people, and this year it is vaccinating us against smallpox in various Yi areas. In order to improve the culture of our Yi people, two Yi people's primary schools have also been established. The Yi people said with emotion: "Chairman Mao is really thoughtful. If we don't have food, he sends food; if we don't have farm tools, he sends farm tools. He is afraid that we will get sick and delay production, so he sends doctors to treat us. When we get the food and farm tools, and when we see the doctors, we think of our benefactor, Chairman Mao."
    The changes in all aspects of the Yi people in Mabian make me deeply feel that without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our Yi people would not have such a happy life. Now the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have stipulated in the draft constitution the policy of helping the people of ethnic minorities develop political, economic, cultural and other construction undertakings, which further encourages our Yi people to build our great motherland together with the people of the whole country.

    彝族人民祖祖辈辈没有碰到过的大喜事
    四川省马边县副县长　乌抛大曲（彝族）
    共产党、毛主席把各民族一律平等，禁止对任何民族的歧视和压迫，在少数民族住的地方实行区域自治，让少数民族当家作主；帮助少数民族发展政治、经济、文化建设事业……都规定在宪法草案上了。这简直是我们彝族人民几千年来没有梦想到的事情，祖祖辈辈没有碰到过的大喜事。其实，回想起来，这件大喜事早就已经开始了。共产党、人民政府来了后，就是照这样子为我们办事的。
    四川马边县在凉山地区的边缘，是祖国一个偏僻、贫穷的地区。可是在共产党和毛主席的领导下，彝族人民几年来的变化是令人兴奋的、愉快的。一九五一年十二月马边民族民主联合政府成立了，我们彝族人民享受了当家作主的权利。共产党、人民政府为我们培养了大批的彝族干部，到现在已有乡长级以上的干部一百三十七人参加了政府工作，来管理本民族内部的事务。政府领导彝、汉族干部和人民进行了民族政策的学习，并在彝族、汉族杂居的地方召开了不少的团结会、联欢会，和解了不少的“冤家”和纠纷，促进了民族间与民族内部的团结，彝、汉族人民间出现了互助、友爱、互相尊重的新气象。彝族人民都深深地感到：没有共产党、毛主席的领导教育，哪里能这样哟！
    在共产党和人民政府的关怀与帮助下，彝族人民的生产得到了很大发展，生活也得到不断的改善和提高。人民政府大力为我们彝族人民解决生产和生活上的困难。去年春耕生产开始以后，正值春荒、夏荒的时候，人民政府发给了我们十万四千多斤包谷和四千五百八十八万元的救济款，解决了我们五千多户人的口粮；还发放了大小农具一千六百五十四件和二千二百四十三万元的贷款，及时解决了我们生产上的困难。当虫灾兽灾严重威胁生产的时候，人民政府又领导我们捉虫打兽，去年共打了一千三百多只野兽，及时扑灭了虫害、兽害，保护了庄稼。在彝、汉杂居的地方组织了彝、汉换工组，又组织了彝民生产小组，加上生产技术指导站的帮助，彝、汉族农民一般都改进了生产技术，增产百分之五以上。今年人民政府又继续发给了我们二十五万七千多斤包谷、二百八十万元的救济款和大小农具三千二百五十九件，并贷款二千二百二十七万元。
    人民政府更为了解决我们土特产的销路和供应我们必需的日用品，在走马坪、雪口山、三河口等地设立了国营贸易公司收购组，去年就收购了价值一亿四千多万元的土特产，并及时供应给我们便宜的盐巴、布匹、针线等日用品。中国茶业公司收购组仅在袁家溪自治乡就收购了价值八千万元的茶叶。今年又继续在各地收购土特产。这些对彝族人民生活的改善起了很大的作用。几年来的医药卫生和文教工作，也得到了不断的发展。人民政府为我们培养了很多的民族卫生工作干部，并在走马坪、雪口山、峰溪、三河口等地设立了卫生所，组织了一个民族卫生工作医疗队，深入彝区为我们治病。去年就为我们医治了二万四千多人的病，今年又在彝区各地为我们种牛痘。为了提高我们彝族人民的文化，还创办了两所彝民小学。彝族人民都感动地说：“毛主席真想得周到，我们没有口粮就发口粮，没有农具就发农具，生怕我们害病耽误生产，就派医生来给我们治病。我们一拿到了口粮、农具，一看到了医生，就想起了我们的恩人毛主席。”
    马边彝族人民各方面的变化，使我深深地感到没有共产党、毛主席的领导，我们彝族人民不会有这样幸福的生活的。现在共产党、毛主席把帮助少数民族人民发展政治、经济、文化等建设事业的政策，规定在宪法草案里去了，这更加鼓舞我们彝族人民，和全国人民一道，来建设我们伟大的祖国。
