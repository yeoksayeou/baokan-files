Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Heavy Industry Jung Il-ryong delivered a report at the meeting.

Jung Il-ryong said: After winning the victory in the anti-aggression war, the Korean people have been engaged in post-war national economic recovery and development for more than a year and have achieved great success.

Jung Il-ryong also said: Since the signing of the armistice agreement, the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique have continuously violated the armistice agreement and obstructed the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

The Korean people are watching every move of the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique with high vigilance.

After Jung Il-ryong's report, Soviet Ambassador to North Korea S.P. Suzdalev delivered a congratulatory speech.

Finally, the meeting unanimously adopted a telegram of thanks to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government.

    【新华社平壤十五日电】平壤各界一千多人十四日下午七时在牡丹峰剧场举行盛大集会，隆重庆祝“八·一五”朝鲜解放九周年。
    金日成元帅出席了大会。参加大会的还有：朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱，内阁副首相崔庸健、金一、崔昌益、洪命熹、郑一龙、朴义琓，内阁各相，各民主政党、群众团体的负责人，朝鲜人民军高级将领，共和国英雄，劳动英雄和平壤地区劳动人民代表等。

    大会的主席台上悬着金日成、马林科夫、毛泽东的巨幅画像和朝、苏、中三国国旗。
    内阁副首相兼重工业相郑一龙在大会上做了报告。他说：自从伟大的苏联军队在九年前的今天解放了朝鲜以后，朝鲜人民走上了为创造祖国的独立和繁荣而斗争的新的历史道路。
    郑一龙说：朝鲜人民在赢得了反侵略战争的胜利以后，到现在已经进行了一年多的战后人民经济恢复发展工作，并取得了巨大的成就。郑一龙着重指出了苏联、中华人民共和国和其他各人民民主国家的援助对朝鲜战后恢复建设的巨大作用。
