Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 16th: Paris' "Le Monde" published an interview of German Democratic Republic Premier Otto Grotewohl by the newspaper's Berlin correspondent, Robert D'Harcourt.

	Question: Do you think that after the successful conclusion of the Geneva Conference and the recent notes from the Soviet Union, a new meeting of the four powers occupying Germany has become possible?

	Answer: Yes, I think that after the successful conclusion of the Geneva Conference, it is possible and necessary to devote efforts to resolving the European and German questions. Therefore, the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a meeting in the coming months to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system has received the unconditional support of the German Democratic Republic government. The German people are particularly concerned about the establishment of a security system that includes all European countries, because this is a reliable way to create conditions for the reunification of Germany and the signing of a peace treaty with Germany. From this point of view, the government and People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic have agreed to participate in such a meeting and such a European collective security treaty.

	Question: What methods do you hope to use to discuss the opinions of East and West German representatives, regardless of Chancellor Adenauer's attitude toward the German Democratic Republic?

	Answer: The government of the German Democratic Republic has always stated that negotiations must be used to discuss the conditions that can bring East and West Germany closer together, and has expressed its willingness to conduct such negotiations. Based on the government's proposal, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic decided on August 4, 1954, to submit a formal document to the Federal Republic government, inviting it to send plenipotentiary representatives to negotiate with representatives of the German Democratic Republic to determine Germany's common views on resolving the pressing issues raised within the framework of the European security system.

	Obviously, despite Chancellor Adenauer's rejectionist attitude, an increasing number of residents in West Germany are advocating an agreement between Germans. The idea of an agreement between East and West Germany will eventually overcome all obstacles and triumph.

	In response to a question about holding pan-German general elections, Grotewohl said: According to the inalienable right of all peoples to decide their own national destiny, the peaceful reunification of Germany is first and foremost a matter for the German people themselves. In order for the German people to make decisions freely through free and democratic elections, the occupying forces must be withdrawn in advance. Germans themselves must prepare for their own elections and hold elections in accordance with the election law they have jointly formulated in advance. The German people hope that they will have complete freedom to prepare for and hold pan-German elections...

	In response to a question about the consequences for Germany if the French parliament approves the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, Grotewohl said: The "European Defence Community" treaty hinders the peaceful resolution of the German question. Only by abolishing these treaties can there be hope of reaching an agreement on the establishment of a peaceful, unified, democratic, and independent Germany.

	The entry into force of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty will fuel the revival of revanchist militarism in West Germany and contribute to the establishment of a dangerous source of aggression in Europe. The purpose of these treaties is to prevent the peaceful reunification of Germany and to drag West Germany into an aggressive militarist bloc, which will make it possible for German militarism to first threaten Germany's western neighbors, that is, first threaten France. On the other hand, if West Germany is drawn into a revanchist war to attack Eastern Europe, the French people will also be plunged into a huge adventure.

	From this point of view, the entry into force of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty is neither in the interests of the German people nor in the interests of the French people.

	The remarks of influential politicians in West Germany that "the road to East Germany goes through Paris" and the demanding tone of West German militarists towards France all prove that the resurgence of German militarism is a great danger to the French people. On such a road, it is impossible to improve relations between France and Germany. However, cooperation within a pan-European collective security system can give Franco-German relations a completely new and peaceful form, because, in contrast to the "European Defence Community," a pan-European collective security system guarantees that each participating country has independent, autonomous, and equal rights. In Germany, especially in the German Democratic Republic, there are influential and powerful peaceful democratic forces that are sufficient to guarantee the establishment of such peaceful relations between Germany and France.

	It is absolutely beneficial for the French people to understand the opinions of various political forces in Germany. The French government recognized the representatives of the two parts of Vietnam in Geneva and listened to their opinions, thus creating the necessary conditions for reaching a successful agreement. Since this method led to a ceasefire in Geneva, why can't this method be adopted to eliminate the dangers of new conspiracies that may lead to a European war or a new Franco-German war?

	In response to another question, Grotewohl refuted the fabricated figures listed in the British-published "White Paper" regarding the number of people's police in the German Democratic Republic and the number of police in West Germany.

	Grotewohl concluded: The government of the German Democratic Republic remains prepared to negotiate with representatives of West Germany on the number and equipment of police in East and West Germany. As long as there is a willingness to negotiate sincerely, it will be easy to find a way to hold such negotiations. However, on the West German side, there is apparently a fear of conducting such negotiations, because such negotiations would hinder the remilitarization of the Federal Republic.

    就和平解决欧洲问题和德国问题
    格罗提渥答巴黎“世界报”记者问
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎十六日电：巴黎“世界报”刊载了德意志民主共和国总理奥·格罗提渥答该报驻柏林记者罗·德库尔问。
    问：你是不是认为，日内瓦会议圆满结束和苏联提出了最近几次照会后，占领德国的四国举行一次新的会议已成为可能呢？
    答：是的，我认为，日内瓦会议圆满结束后，可能和必须致力于解决欧洲和德国问题。所以，苏联关于在最近几个月内举行会议讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，得到德意志民主共和国政府的无条件的拥护。德国人民特别关心建立包括所有欧洲国家在内的安全体系，因为通过这样的途径就能为统一德国和签订对德和约创造可靠的条件。根据这种观点，德意志民主共和国政府和人民议院已同意参加这样的会议和这样的欧洲集体安全条约。
    问：你希望通过什么方法，不管阿登纳总理对德意志民主共和国的态度如何，来讨论东德和西德代表的意见呢？
    答：德意志民主共和国政府过去一直表示必须用谈判来商讨能使东德和西德接近的条件，并表示了进行这种谈判的愿望。德意志民主共和国人民议院根据政府的建议，于一九五四年八月四日决定向联邦共和国政府提出一个郑重的文件，请它选派全权代表来和德意志民主共和国代表进行谈判，以决定德国对解决在欧洲安全体系范围内提出来的切身问题的共同观点。
    显然，尽管阿登纳总理采取拒绝的态度，西德的大多数居民愈来愈多地主张在德国人之间达成协议。东西德之间达成协议的主张终将突破种种阻碍而取得胜利。
    格罗提渥在回答关于举行全德普选的问题时说：根据各国人民自己决定自己民族命运这一不可剥夺的权利，和平统一德国首先是德国人民自己的事情。为了使德国人民能够通过自由、民主的选举自由地作出决定，必须事先撤退占领军。必须由德国人自己筹备自己的选举，并根据他们事先共同制定的选举法举行选举。德国人民希望他们有筹备和举行全德选举的完全自由……
    格罗提渥在回答法国议会批准波恩条约和巴黎条约将对德国产生什么后果这一问题时说：“欧洲防务集团”条约阻碍德国问题的和平解决。只有取消这些条约，才有希望在建立一个和平、统一、民主和独立的德国的问题上达成协议。
    波恩条约和巴黎条约的生效将助长西德的复仇主义的军国主义复活，并促成在欧洲建立一个危险的侵略策源地。这些条约的目的是要阻挠德国的和平统一，把西德拉入侵略性的军国主义集团，这个集团将使德国军国主义有可能首先威胁德国西面的邻国，也就是首先威胁法国。从另一方面说，如果西德被卷入进攻东欧的复仇主义战争，法国人民也同样要陷于巨大的冒险。
    由此看来，波恩条约和巴黎条约的生效既不符合德国人民的利益，也不符合法国人民的利益。
    西德有势力的政治家所谓“走向东德去的道路要经过巴黎”这种言论以及西德军国主义者对法国的苛求的口吻都证明：德国军国主义的再起对法国人民来说是一种极大的危险。在这样一条道路上，法、德之间的关系不可能求得改善。但在全欧集体安全体系内的合作却可以使法、德关系获得完全新的、和平的形式，因为，与“欧洲防务集团”相反，全欧集体安全体系保证每个参加国都有独立、自主和平等的权利。在德国，特别是在德意志民主共和国，存在着有影响的、有力量的和平民主力量，这种力量足以保障德国和法国之间建立这样的和平关系。
    法国人民了解一下德国国内各种政治力量的意见，是绝对有益的。法国政府在日内瓦承认了越南两部分的代表，并听取了他们的意见，因而为胜利达成协议创造了必要的条件。既然这种办法在日内瓦导致停战，那么为什么在消除可能促成欧洲战争或德法新战争的新阴谋的危险方面就不能采用这种办法呢？
    格罗提渥在答复另外一个问题时，驳斥了在英国公布的“白皮书”中所列举的关于德意志民主共和国人民警察的人数和西德警察人数的捏造数字。
    格罗提渥最后说道：德意志民主共和国政府仍旧准备就东德和西德的警察人数和装备问题和西德代表进行谈判。只要有了诚恳协商的意愿，就容易找到举行这种谈判的办法。但是，在西德方面，显然害怕进行这种谈判，因为这种谈判会使联邦共和国的重新军国主义化发生困难。
