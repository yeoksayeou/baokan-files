Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 24th: The Wuhan City Flood Control Headquarters comprehensively studied the characteristics of the current sustained high water level and the new dangers that may occur during the receding period. It decided to mobilize the city's flood control teams to immediately carry out the fifth phase of dike reinforcement work. Among the several major projects, the focus is on reinforcing the flood walls along the river. Continue to inspect underground pipelines along the river to solve the problem of water leakage from underground pipelines. Prepare to fill in the ponds near the dikes along the river that pose significant potential hazards with a large amount of earth. On each dike section, it was decided to vigorously strengthen wave protection facilities. Use larger iron anchors and thicker bamboo cables to further reinforce the wave-breaking wooden rafts. For dike sections that are easily subjected to wind and wave impact, prepare to add several defense lines inside the wooden rafts with willow rows and reed mats to reduce the impact of level six to seven winds and waves. On the Zhanggong Dike and other earth dikes, focus on preventing slope slippage and piping, and be prepared to rescue serious dangers such as large slope slippage and large piping at any time. According to the overall trend of water level decline, it was decided that the dike body would generally not be raised during this phase of the project; and preparations would be made to remove the excessively high sub-dikes as early as possible when the water level receded to a certain level to reduce the burden on the dikes.

In Wuhan's flood control work, due to the complex situation of urban flood walls and underground pipelines, the technical requirements are quite strict, and it is easy to encounter many problems that are more complicated than rural flood control. However, it has many advantages of a large city, using trains and trucks to transport soil, using steel sheet piles for emergency rescue, using pressure grouting methods to reinforce flood walls, and using drilling rigs to explore geological conditions. In this phase of the project, these many favorable conditions will be fully utilized, and it is required to complete these projects within five to ten days.

The Yangtze River water level at Wuhan Customs has remained above 28 meters for 43 consecutive days and above 29 meters for 21 consecutive days. Since the water level began to fall from 29.73 meters at 3:00 a.m. on the 19th, it has fallen a total of 1.3 decimeters by 1:00 p.m. on the 24th. The water level at 1:00 p.m. on the 24th was 29.60 meters. However, it is still 1.32 meters higher than the highest water level in previous years and 2.66 meters higher than the water level (26.94 meters) when the Nationalist reactionary rule broke the dike in Hankou in 1931.

    武汉市进行第五期加固堤防工程
    【新华社武汉二十四日电】武汉市防汛总指挥部通盘研究了当前高水位的持续性的特点和在退水时期可能发生的新险情，决定动员全市防汛队伍立即进行第五期加强堤防的工程。在几项主要工程中，着重加固沿江的防水墙。继续检查沿江沿河地下管道，解决地下管道漏水问题。对沿江堤防附近隐患较大的水塘准备用大量土方加以填塞。在各个堤段上，决定大力加强防浪设备。用更大的铁锚和更粗的篾缆进一步加固防浪木排。对容易受到风浪冲击的堤段，准备在木排里面用柳排、芦席加设几道防线，减轻六级到七级风浪的袭击。在张公堤等各个土堤上，着重防止脱坡和管漏，并随时准备抢救大脱坡和大管漏等严重险象。根据整个水位退落趋势，决定这期工程一般不加高堤身；并准备在水位退到一定程度时，及早把过高的子堤搬开，以减轻堤防负担。
    在武汉市防汛工作中，由于城市防水墙和地下管道等复杂情况，技术上要求相当严格，容易碰到许多比农村防汛更复杂的问题。但具有大城市的许多有利条件，用火车和汽车运土，用钢板桩抢险，用压力灌浆办法加固防水墙，用钻探机钻探地层情况。在这期工程中，将充分运用这许多有利的条件，要求在五天到十天内，完成这些工程。
    武汉关长江水位持续在二十八公尺以上已有四十三天，持续在二十九公尺以上已有二十一天。自十九日晨三时水位由二九点七三公尺开始回落后，到二十四日下午一时总计已下落一公寸三。二十四日下午一时水位为二九点六零公尺。但比历年最高水位还高出一点三二公尺，比一九三一年国民党反动统治时期汉口决堤时的水位（二六点九四公尺）高出二点六六公尺。
