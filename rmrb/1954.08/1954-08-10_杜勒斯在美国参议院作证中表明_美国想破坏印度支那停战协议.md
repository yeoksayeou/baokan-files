Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 8th: The testimony of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles before a closed-door meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee on July 21st was released on the 6th. In his testimony, Dulles stated that the United States intends to include Laos, Cambodia, and Bao Dai's Vietnam within the aggression line of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, as areas "protected" by this bloc. This blatant attempt by the United States to violate the Indochina Armistice Agreement is, in effect, to include Laos, Cambodia, and Bao Dai's Vietnam within the scope of aggression and war activities that the United States can carry out at will. Dulles even indicated the intention to include Burma within this scope, as an area "protected" by the Southeast Asia bloc. Dulles's intention once again proves that the purpose of the United States' accelerated formation of the Southeast Asia bloc is to undermine the implementation of the Indochina Armistice Agreement, undermine the consolidation of peace in Indochina, and threaten peace and security in Southeast Asia.
    In his testimony, Dulles also said that "the only thing" the United States possesses in promoting its conspiracy in Southeast Asia "is money." This shows that the United States' blatant military aggression conspiracy is already very unpopular in Asia. The United States is now attempting to lure Southeast Asian countries into the trap of American aggressors with dollars and enslaving so-called "economic aid" programs.

    杜勒斯在美国参议院作证中表明  
    美国想破坏印度支那停战协议
      【新华社八日讯】华盛顿消息：六日发表了美国国务卿杜勒斯七月二十一日在参议院拨款委员会秘密会议上的证词，杜勒斯在作证中表示，美国企图把老挝、柬埔寨和保大越南划在东南亚侵略集团的侵略线内，作为由这个集团“保护”的地区。美国这种公然违反印度支那停战协议的企图，实际上也就是要把老挝、柬埔寨和保大越南划入美国可以任意进行侵略和战争活动的范围。杜勒斯甚至表示要把缅甸也划入这个范围，作为由东南亚集团“保护”的地区。杜勒斯的这种打算再一次证明，美国正在加紧拼凑东南亚集团的目的就在破坏印度支那停战协议的实施，破坏印度支那和平的巩固，威胁东南亚的和平和安全。
    杜勒斯在作证中并且说，美国在东南亚推行其阴谋计划“所具备的唯一的东西是金钱”。这说明，美国露骨的军事侵略阴谋在亚洲已十分不得人心，美国现在正企图用美元、用奴役性的所谓“经济援助”计划来引诱东南亚国家进入美国侵略者的圈套。
