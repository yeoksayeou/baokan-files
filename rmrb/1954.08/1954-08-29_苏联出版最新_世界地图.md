Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 28th: The Soviet Union has recently published a comprehensive "World Map" in a large volume. The entire volume consists of two hundred and eighty-three color maps, divided into four parts: general world maps, maps of the Soviet Union, maps of various countries, and maps of countries and oceans in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The general world map section includes various natural geographic and political geographic maps, illustrating the structure of the Earth's surface, the distribution of the population, and the state of economic development. It also illustrates the changes in political divisions after the First and Second World Wars. The section on maps of the Soviet Union includes detailed introductory geographical material about the Soviet Union. Each Soviet republic has a dedicated map introduction. The administrative divisions of the Soviet Union on the map are based on the situation as of June 15, 1953. The section on maps of various countries occupies a relatively large amount of space. Each people's democratic country, European capitalist country, and North and South American country has a detailed map introduction.

This "World Map" pays great attention to Asian countries. Asian countries have never been as detailed as they are in this map compared to previously published maps.
