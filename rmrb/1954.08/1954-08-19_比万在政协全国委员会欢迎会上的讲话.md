Bevan's Speech at the स्वागत समारोह of the CPPCC National Committee

It is unnecessary to spend time on formal greetings. Our being here is sufficient to express our support for the Chinese People's Revolution. As Mr. Attlee said, the Labour movement's reaction to the Chinese Revolution is the same as the support given to the Russian Revolution after World War I. British workers, in their own domestic struggle against capitalist forces, naturally and immediately sympathize with the struggles of workers in other countries.

This struggle takes various forms because it is carried out under different historical conditions. These conditions do not determine the ultimate goal of socialism, but they do influence the methods of achieving socialism and the process of change. There is no universally applicable formula for social progress. If there were, our task would be easier. In every political environment, there are two factors: the nature of the goals we ourselves determine and the traditions we must rely on when pursuing these goals. When we fight for our goals, if we ignore national and historical traditions, we run the risk of not understanding the attitudes of the masses we represent. Therefore, socialism is by no means empty preaching of principles, but a living reality, and this living reality must find vitality in the actual struggle environment.

I say this because some people often judge European situations by Asian standards, just as there are those who judge Europeans according to the situations in Asia or elsewhere. Only by studying the specific circumstances of each event can we gain reliable insights. If socialist strategies are formulated like rigid dogmas, then they lack relevance to the needs of the time and place.

For example, the situations in many European countries are different from the past and present situations in Asia in two important aspects. First, most European societies have fully developed democratic constitutions, which provide the possibility for a more peaceful and orderly transformation of society. Dispersing political power among the masses and obeying the decisions of the majority through parliament turns the right to participate in government into a tool of revolution, if we resolutely and forcefully apply the above methods. We have no illusions that reactionary forces will obstruct when people use their political power to achieve socialism. If we do not recognize that political democracy itself is a political force, then we believe it is naive and useless. British socialists believe that some people who call themselves revolutionaries, by not recognizing the progressive nature of parliamentary representation, make themselves politically useless.

The second aspect in which we differ from you and many countries in your region is that your struggle is also a national independence struggle against imperialism. This has resulted in the emotion born of national consciousness and the desire for liberation surpassing the social struggle. Therefore, you have an emotional driving force that we do not have. This situation enables your country to mobilize some sections of the population to fight for socialism, while we cannot mobilize these people to the same extent. People who differ from your many political and economic goals are still prepared to work with you because you have provided and are still providing the only way for your country to be liberated from foreign control. This has the support of a deepening and lasting emotion for your struggle. This gives your struggle sharper weapons, allowing you to break away from traditional forms of struggle more profoundly and quickly.

The main source of differences between us is precisely this combination of national struggle and social struggle. If we do not understand this, then we will not be able to understand each other's positions. It is the reason why our movement has progressed more slowly. At the same time, it also explains why we can avoid making many of the sacrifices that you have had to make. We hope that our visit and this discussion can enable us to better understand each other's positions.

There is a factor that may appear before us, a factor that will immediately raise the political temperature in Europe, and that is the threat of war. The consequences of war conducted with modern weapons are so terrible for all mankind that preventing such a war has now become the primary consideration for the people of all countries. How can we have progress and maintain peace—this is the task of our generation. A state of stagnation cannot be the basis of peace. This is what the defenders of the old order cannot see.

Collective security cannot be based on the social status quo. People must be able to improve their destiny, and at the same time, their efforts in this regard should not be condemned as part of a conspiracy to impose some kind of ideology on others. It must also be recognized that modern war no longer has the possibility of producing a successful social revolution. Just as modern scientific industrial technology has made political enslavement impossible, modern war may lead us all to ruin. Therefore, it must be possible for people to realize their just national and social aspirations without war or the threat of war.

Therefore, accepting peaceful coexistence is not only a condition for human survival, but it must also have its positive role. Beyond coexistence, we must add cooperation including cultural, commercial and economic exchanges. Our policies should not be based on the leadership of this or that country, no matter how powerful that country may be, but on the basis that all countries, large and small, are equal. It should not be based on seeking a group of countries that agree on everything, but on allowing various differences to exist and be able to express those differences to each other. The revolution in every country is based on previous revolutions, learning from previous revolutions, but not necessarily imitating them in every aspect. It is in this spirit that we are visiting your country. I am sure we will leave your country in the same spirit. We believe that your future is brighter than the experience of your long and brave struggle, and that the Chinese people will reap the fruits of their sacrifices in peace.

　　比万在政协全国委员会欢迎会上的讲话
    为正式的致意而花费时间是不必要的。我们到这里来，本身就足以表示我们对中国人民革命的支持。正如艾德礼先生所说的，工党运动对中国革命的反应，是和在第一次世界大战后对俄国革命所给予的支持一样的。英国工人在他们自己国内反对资本主义势力的斗争，使他们很自然地对其他国家工人的斗争立即给予同情。
    这个斗争采取着各种不同的形式，因为是在不同的历史条件下进行的。这种条件并不决定社会主义的最终目的，但是它影响着达到社会主义的方法以及变化的进程。对社会进步来说，并没有一种普遍适用的公式。如果有这种公式的话，我们的任务就容易了。在每个政治环境中，都有两个因素，那就是我们自己决定的目标的性质，和在追求这些目标时所必须依据的传统。当我们为我们的目标斗争的时候，忽视了民族的和历史的传统，那么，我们就会使我们有不了解我们所代表的群众的态度的危险。因此，社会主义决不是空洞的原则说教，而是活生生的现实，这个活生生的现实要在实际的斗争环境中找到生命力。
    我这样说，是因为某些人常以亚洲的标准来判断欧洲情况，正如也有一种按亚洲或其他地方的情况来判断欧洲人。只有研究每个事件的具体情况，我们才能得到可靠的见解。如果把社会主义策略制定得像死板的教条一样，那么，它就和当时当地的需要缺乏关联。
    比如，许多欧洲国家的情况，在两个重要方面与亚洲过去和目前的情况都是不同的。首先，大多数欧洲社会都有了充分发展的民主的宪法，这些宪法为较为和平而有秩序地改造社会提供了可能性。将政治权力分散于群众当中，和通过议会服从大多数人的决议，这样就把参政权变成了革命的工具，假如我们坚决有力地运用上述方法的话。当人民为达到社会主义而运用他们的政治权力的时候，反动势力会加以阻挠，对这一点，我们并没有错觉。假如，不承认政治民主本身是一政治力量，那我们认为就是幼稚而无用的。英国社会主义者认为，有些自称为革命家的人，不承认议会代表制的进取性，因而就造成这些人在政治上的无用。
    我们与你们以及在你们地区中许多国家不同的第二方面，就是你们的斗争同时也是反对帝国主义的民族独立斗争。这就产生了一种结果，就是由于对民族自觉和要求解放的愿望而生的感情超过了社会斗争。因此，你们有了一种我们所没有的感情动力。这种情况使你们国家能够动员人口中一些部分为社会主义而奋斗，而这些人，我们就不能动员到同等程度。与你们许多政治和经济目标不同的人，仍准备与你们一起工作，因为你们提供了而且还在提供使你们国家从外国控制中获得解放的唯一方法。这就有着日益加深的持久感情来支持你们的斗争。这就使你们的斗争有了更尖锐的武器，从而使你们能够更深刻更迅速地摆脱传统的斗争形式。
    我们之间的主要不同的来源正是这种民族斗争与社会斗争的结合。假使不了解这一点，那么我们将不能互相了解双方的立场。它是我们的运动进展得比较迟缓的原因。同时它也说明了为什么我们可以不作许多你们不得不作的牺牲。我们希望我们的访问与这次讨论可以使我们更好地了解相互的立场。
    有一种因素可能会出现在我们的面前，这个因素会立即使欧洲的政治热度上升，这就是战争的威胁。用现代化武器进行的战争的后果对全人类都是如此的可怕，以至于防止这样的战争现在已经成为各国人民的首要的考虑了。怎样才能又有进步，又能维持和平——这就是我们一代的任务。停滞不前的状态不能成为和平的基础。这就是旧秩序的维护者所不能看到的事情。
    集体安全是不能以社会现状为基础的。必须让人民能够改善他们的命运，同时他们在这方面所作的努力不会被谴责为把某种思想强加于别人的阴谋的一部分。同时也必须承认，现代化战争不再有可能产生成功的社会革命。正如现代科学的工业技术已使政治上的奴役成为不可能一样。现代化的战争可能会使我们全都趋于毁灭。因此，必须使人民有可能不经过战争或战争威胁就可以实现他们的正当的民族愿望和社会愿望。
    因此，接受和平共处不仅仅是人类生存的条件，而且也必须有其积极的作用。共处之外，我们必须加上包括文化、商业和经济交流在内的合作。我们的政策不应建立在这一个或那一个国家领导权的基础上，不论那个国家多末强大，而应建立在所有大大小小的国家都平等的基础上。不应建立在寻求事事一致的国家集团上，而应建立在容许各种分歧存在而且能相互表示分歧的基础上。每一个国家的革命都是以以前的革命为依据的，向以前的革命学习，但却不一定要在每一方面都去仿效。我们就是以这样的精神来访问贵国的。我确信我们也将本着同样的精神离开贵国。我们相信你们的前途比起你们长期勇敢的斗争的经历来得光明，中国人民将会在和平中收获他们的牺牲结成的果实。
