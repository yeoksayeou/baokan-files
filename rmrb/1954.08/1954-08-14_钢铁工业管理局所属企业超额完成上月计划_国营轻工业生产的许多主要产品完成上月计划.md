Enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry completed 105% of their total output value plan for July. Enterprises that completed the total output value plan accounted for 80% of the total number of enterprises. The completion of major product production plans was as follows: iron ore 110%, metallurgical coke 108.8%, steel 101.5%, pig iron 98.1%, steel 98.4%. Among the enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration, 12 units, including Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Fushun Steel Plant, and Tangshan Steel Plant, comprehensively overfulfilled the main product plans.

In July, enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration achieved some new accomplishments in production. For example, a blast furnace at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant set a new daily record for pig iron production on the 31st, with a utilization coefficient of effective volume reaching 0.759, an increase of 2.18% over the previous highest daily production record. The open-hearth furnace operating rate of the plant increased by 4.74% compared with the plan, and the cold repair time was shortened by 23.5% compared with the planned time. The converter expansion project of Tangshan Steel Plant was successfully put into production in July, and the daily output increased by 28%, further meeting the needs of steel rolling production. On July 29, the No. 1 Plant of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company set a new daily record for converter steel production, an increase of 9.25% over the previous highest new record. The cold repair time in the open-hearth furnace of the No. 3 Plant of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company was shortened by 5.1% compared with the planned time. In addition, Longyan Iron Mine started to focus on the organization and leadership of production from the beginning of the month, which greatly improved the balance of mining production and basically overcame the phenomenon of shock work. The mining balance rate of the mine in July reached 0.98 (0.946 in June).

In July, the production of some enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration was affected to a certain extent due to floods. Individual enterprises did not pay enough attention to the regular maintenance and planned overhaul of equipment, which directly affected the completion of production tasks, or the overhaul of equipment was simply rushed and the quality was neglected, resulting in abnormal operation after being put into production, which also greatly affected production.

In addition, some leading cadres of enterprises developed complacency and laxity due to the better completion of the national plan in the first half of the year, and relaxed the organization and leadership of production. The Iron and Steel Industry Administration has promptly discovered this situation and criticized and corrected it. ×××

In July, many major products produced by state-owned light industry, such as pulp, various types of paper, cigarettes, beer, alcohol, sulfaguanidine, rickshaw tires, V-belts, vegetable oil, and canned food, completed their output plans.

In July, the quality of paper produced by enterprises under the Central Paper Industry Administration improved, the product qualification rate increased compared with the second quarter of this year, and the number of defective products decreased by more than 500 tons compared with June.

The injections produced by Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory rarely completed the national plan in the first half of this year, but in July, after learning the production inspection methods for injections from Shandong Pharmaceutical Factory, the daily output increased from 80,000 pieces to 120,000 pieces, overfulfilling the national plan.

In July, some enterprises and some products did not complete the national plan. For example, Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factory No. 3 did not complete the production plan for procaine penicillin, and Taiyuan Paper Factory and Shenyang Paper Factory did not do a good job in preparing for the manufacture of new products, which affected the completion of the production plan.

    钢铁工业管理局所属企业超额完成上月计划
    国营轻工业生产的许多主要产品完成上月计划
    中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业完成七月份生产总值计划的百分之一百零五。完成生产总值计划的企业占企业总数的百分之八十。完成主要产品生产计划的情况是：铁矿石完成百分之一百一十，冶金焦一百零八点八，钢材一百零一点五，生铁九十八点一，钢九十八点四。钢铁工业管理局所属企业中，有太原钢铁厂、抚顺钢厂、唐山钢厂等十二个单位全面超额地完成了主要产品计划。
    七月份钢铁工业管理局所属企业在生产上取得了一些新的成就。如太原钢铁厂某号高炉于三十一日创生铁日产新纪录，有效容积利用系数达到○点七五九，比过去最高日产新纪录提高百分之二点一八。该厂平炉作业率较计划提高了百分之四点七四，冷修时间共较计划时间缩短百分之二十三点五。唐山钢厂转炉扩建工程七月份顺利投入生产，日产量提高了百分之二十八，进一步满足了轧钢生产的需要。上海钢铁公司第一厂于七月二十九日创转炉钢日产新纪录，比过去最高新纪录提高了百分之九点二五。上海钢铁公司第三厂平炉中冷修共较计划时间缩短百分之五点一。此外龙烟铁矿从月初即开始抓紧对生产的组织领导，使采矿生产均衡性大为提高，基本上克服了突击现象。该矿七月份采矿均衡率已达到零点九八（六月份为零点九四六）。
    七月份钢铁工业管理局某些企业由于水患使生产受到一定的影响。个别企业对设备的经常维护和计划检修工作注意不够，直接影响生产任务不能完成，或设备大修单纯赶快而忽视质量，以致投入生产后运转不正常，也使生产受到很大的影响。
    此外有些企业领导干部由于上半年国家计划完成较好，滋长了自满松懈情绪，放松了对生产的组织领导。钢铁工业管理局已及时发现这种情况并加以批判纠正。×××
    七月份国营轻工业所生产的纸浆，各种纸、卷烟、啤酒、酒精、磺胺胍、力车外胎、三角带、植物油、罐头等许多主要产品都完成了产量计划。
    七月份中央造纸工业管理局所属企业生产的纸的质量有了改进，产品合格率比今年第二季提高，次品比六月份减少五百多吨。
    东北制药总厂生产的针剂，在今年上半年内很少完成国家计划，但在七月份学习了山东制药厂针剂的生产检查方法，每天的产量从八万支提高到十二万支，超额完成了国家计划。
    七月份有些企业和有些产品没有完成国家计划。如上海药品三厂没有完成普鲁卡因青霉素的生产计划，太原造纸厂和沈阳造纸厂没有作好新产品制造前的准备工作，影响了生产计划的完成。
