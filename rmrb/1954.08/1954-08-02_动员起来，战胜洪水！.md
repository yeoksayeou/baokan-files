Mobilize and Conquer the Flood!

This year is a year of unusually high rainfall and special climatic changes, the most in recent decades. Within our country, on the one hand, most areas have sufficient rainfall and favorable weather, with crops growing well and a bountiful summer harvest. On the other hand, in some local areas, especially in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the rainfall has been particularly heavy and concentrated, causing the Yangtze and Huai River water levels to rise sharply, exceeding previous historical records. The flood seriously threatens the safety of these areas. Therefore, mobilizing and conquering the flood has become the overriding central task for all the people in these areas; the people of the whole country should also be deeply concerned and actively support their struggle.

This spring and summer, the warm and humid air currents from the southern seas of our country and the cold air currents moving south from the northern continent were both strong. They began to clash in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and due to other climatic reasons, the rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River was particularly concentrated. Taking Hunan and Jiangxi as examples, the total rainfall in June generally exceeded 500 millimeters, mostly more than twice the average rainfall of the same month in previous years. In some areas, the rainfall in two or three days was equivalent to the average total rainfall for the entire month in the same period in previous years. This has caused the water levels of the mainstreams and tributaries of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers to rise generally. The water level at the Wuhan Customs of the Yangtze River rose to 28.82 meters on July 30, exceeding the highest water level in previous years. Since July, four major flood peaks have occurred successively in the Huai River basin, and the water volume has also exceeded that of the major floods of 1931 and 1950. Parts of Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Henan have experienced varying degrees of waterlogging and flood disasters. The threat of flooding is still very serious.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, the broad masses of people on both sides of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers began a heroic struggle to overcome the flood in June. Wuhan City formed a flood prevention contingent of more than 200,000 people, and with the extensive assistance of people from all walks of life in urban and rural areas, promptly completed the project of raising and reinforcing the city's more than 100-kilometer-long dikes. Hundreds of thousands of people in the middle reaches of the Huai River completed the construction of a one-meter-high secondary dike on the banks of the Ying River to Hongze Lake for hundreds of kilometers in a short period of time. Millions of people in Hubei, Jiangsu, Anhui and other provinces participated in flood prevention work, and they fought tirelessly against the floods day and night on both sides of the Yangtze River and on the shores of Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake. In this huge ranks and arduous struggle, many heroic figures have emerged! Li Dahan, the deputy county chief of Jiangling County, Hubei, used his body to block the breach in the Jingjiang Dike; Zhou Zhengfa, the Communist Party member and security director of Matang Township, Wuhu County, dedicated his precious life in the flood prevention struggle; and the employees of the Huangshi City Construction Company, under the slogan of "we will not withdraw until the breach is blocked," fought day and night to rescue the river embankment. Their heroic deeds demonstrated the new morality and noble qualities of the people of New China, inspiring all those who are fighting against the flood.

In the face of this year's particularly severe flood situation, some flood control and water storage projects built in previous years have played a role. The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project opened its gates for the first time on July 22 to divert the flood, and the water level in Shashi quickly dropped from 44.39 meters to 43.18 meters. The four reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Huai River and the flood storage projects in low-lying areas such as Laowangpo have also begun to block or store floodwater, which has played an important role in reducing the floods of the Hong River, Ru River, and Ying River. In addition, the People's Government actively and proactively adopted flood diversion and storage measures under the principle of subordinating small interests to large interests, and systematically subsidized the affected people in the flood storage areas to protect the vast areas from water damage. For example, the flood storage in the middle reaches of the Han River and Honghu Lake has played a significant role in relieving the flood risk in Wuhan. Therefore, although this year's flood situation is unprecedentedly severe, the disaster situation is much less severe than the disaster situation in the early days of liberation in 1949, and it is even incomparable to the disaster situation during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in 1931. This proves once again that the various tasks carried out by the People's Government over the past few years to promote people's welfare and eliminate harm have been very effective.

From the work we have done, no government in Chinese history can compare with it. In 1931, during the period of Kuomintang reactionary rule, the water level in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River rose sharply, and the highest water level in Hankou was 28.28 meters; however, when it reached 26.94 meters, which was 1.88 meters lower than the current water level in Hankou, Hankou was flooded. From the beginning of July to the end of October of that year, Hankou was submerged in water for nearly four months, with a water depth of five to seven feet on the ground. That year, sixteen provinces were affected by floods. Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Henan were the seven provinces most severely affected by the floods, with 290 counties. According to the official underestimated estimates at the time, the affected area reached more than 318,000 square kilometers, accounting for about 32.5 percent of the total area of the seven provinces; the affected population was more than 43 million, accounting for about 26 percent of the total population of the seven provinces, of which millions of people were short of clothing, food, and homeless, and countless people died of starvation and disease. What does this comparison illustrate? It shows that in the period of reactionary rule, natural disasters plus man-made disasters would bring heavy losses to the people; while under the leadership of the People's Government, although natural disasters are serious, due to our thorough preparations, well-organized efforts, and correct leadership, the harm of disasters to the people will be greatly reduced.

Of course, we should never be complacent about this and relax our vigilance. According to meteorological forecasts, the flood situation in the Yangtze and Huai Rivers will not fundamentally improve in the near future; even if the water level does not continue to rise, it will take a considerable period of time for the current Yangtze River water to return to normal water levels, and at the same time, other areas should also pay close attention to the new flood situation that may arise after the rainfall moves north. Therefore, we must make persistent efforts and fight to the end for the final victory over the flood.

In the areas of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers where flood prevention is tense, all available manpower and material resources should be mobilized to continue to strengthen dikes and resolutely defend them. We must prevent the emergence of fatigue and laziness after a long period of tense flood prevention; overcome the phenomena of poor organization and chaotic division of labor in flood prevention teams; strictly inspect projects and dikes, strengthen management and maintenance work; and do our best to protect industrial and mining production and transportation, striving not to interrupt them. Industrial and mining enterprises should also make all preparations for preventing floods in a timely manner. In areas that have already suffered from waterlogging and flood disasters, we must rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations to organize the masses to produce and help themselves, do a good job in relief work, reduce the losses of the masses, and relieve the concerns of flood prevention laborers about their families. In North China, Northeast China, and the Yellow River Basin, we must also raise our vigilance, oppose complacency, promptly inspect and strengthen dikes, strengthen communication and transportation equipment, prepare flood prevention materials, and prepare to deal with various situations that may occur after the torrential rain area moves north.

Overcoming flood disasters should be the task of all the people. Therefore, cities and industrial and mining enterprises should do their best to support the rural areas that may be affected and have already been affected. Some factories have undertaken the glorious task of rushing to manufacture flood prevention equipment to support flood prevention and drainage, and they should ensure its completion and overfulfillment ahead of schedule. In some areas, many workers have already taken time out to help farmers in nearby rural areas with flood prevention and drainage, and we should mobilize as many people as possible to participate in this work. Health workers should also do their best to support the disaster areas and prevent epidemics that are prone to occur in the disaster areas. All non-disaster-stricken rural areas should do their best to support the disaster areas. In addition to the necessary manpower and material resources (such as flood prevention materials and seeds for replanting after drainage, and food after disasters), the most important thing at present is to strive to overfulfill the production increase plan in order to make up for the loss of agricultural production in the disaster areas and strive to ensure that the national agricultural production increase plan can still be successfully realized even if some areas suffer from disasters.

Doing a good job in flood prevention and drainage and overcoming this year's floods is of great importance to the socialist construction of our entire country. All cadres and masses in cities and rural areas, disaster areas and non-disaster areas, for our common ideals, common cause, and common happiness, let us unite closely like a harmonious big family! Make persistent efforts and fight to overcome the flood!

### 动员起来，战胜洪水！

    动员起来，战胜洪水！
    今年是近几十年来气候变化特殊雨量最多的一年。在我国境内，一方面是大部分地区雨水充足，风调雨顺，农作物生长良好，夏收丰盈；另一方面，在局部地区，特别是长江中下游，却由于雨量特大，又非常集中，以致江淮水位陡长，超过历年最高纪录。洪水严重地威胁着这些地区的安全。因此，动员起来，战胜洪水，就成为这些地区全体人民当前压倒一切的中心任务；全国人民也应当十分关怀并积极支援他们的斗争。
    今年春夏两季，来自我国南方海洋上的暖湿气流，和同时从北部大陆南下的冷气流都很强烈，它们在长江中下游一带开始交锋，并由于其它气候的原因，以致长江中下游雨量特别集中。以湖南、江西等地为例，六月份全月降雨量普遍在五百公厘以上，大多超过了历年同月平均降雨量的二倍；有些地区两三天里的降雨量就相当于往年同一时期全月的平均总雨量。这就使得长江、淮河的干流和支流的水位普遍上涨：长江武汉关水位七月三十日涨至二八·八二公尺，超过历年最高水位；淮河流域自七月份起，已先后发生了四次巨大洪峰，水量也超过了一九三一年和一九五○年的大水。湖北、湖南、安徽、江西、江苏、河南的部分地区，已发生了程度不同的内涝和洪水灾害。洪水的威胁目前仍然十分严重。
    在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，长江中下游和淮河两岸的广大人民，从六月份开始，展开了战胜洪水的英勇的斗争。武汉市组成了二十多万人的防汛大队，在城乡各阶层人民的广泛协助下，及时完成了全市一百多公里长的堤防加高加固工程。淮河中游十几万人民，在颍河至洪泽湖数百公里的堤岸上，短期内完成了加筑一公尺高的子埝工程。湖北、江苏、安徽等省数百万人参加了防汛工作，他们在长江两岸和洞庭湖、鄱阳湖湖滨日夜警惕地不懈地和洪水斗争着。在这巨大的行列和艰苦的斗争中，出现了不少的英雄人物！湖北江陵县副县长李大汉，用身体堵住了荆江大堤的漏洞；芜湖县马塘乡治安主任共产党员周正发，在防汛斗争中贡献了自己宝贵的生命；黄石市建筑公司职工，在“不堵死漏洞不收兵”的口号下，日夜战斗，抢救了江堤。他们英雄般的事迹，表现了新中国人民的新的道德和高贵的品质，鼓舞了一切向洪水作斗争的人们。
    在今年汛情特别严重的情况下，历年修建的一些防洪蓄水工程都发挥了作用。荆江分洪工程七月二十二日第一次开闸分洪，沙市水位迅速由四四·三九公尺降落到四三·一八公尺；淮河上游的四个水库和老王坡等洼地蓄洪工程，也已开始拦洪或蓄洪，对削减洪河、汝河及颍河的洪水起了重要作用。加上人民政府在小利服从大利的原则下，积极主动地采取分洪和蓄洪的措施，有计划地补助蓄洪区的受灾群众，保护广大地区免除水害。如汉水中游及洪湖的蓄洪，对于解除武汉的水险就有重大的作用。因此，虽然今年的水情空前严重，但灾情却比一九四九年初解放时的灾情大为减轻，比起一九三一年国民党反动统治时期的灾情更是不可同日而语。这又证明了人民政府几年来为人民兴利除害所进行的各项工作是有很大成效的。
    从我们已进行的工作来看，中国历史上任何一个政府都远远不能与之相比。一九三一年，在国民党反动统治时期，长江中下游水位高涨，汉口的最高水位是二八·二八公尺；可是，在达到二六·九四公尺的时候，也就是比目前汉口的水位要低一·八八公尺的时候，汉口就被淹了。从那一年的七月初到十月下旬，汉口被浸在水里将近四个月，平地水深五尺到七尺。那一年，发生水灾的有十六省。湖北、湖南、安徽、江苏、江西、浙江、河南七省，受水灾最重的就有二百九十县。根据当时官方缩小了的估计，被灾面积达三十一万八千多平方公里，占七省总面积约百分之三十二点五；被灾人口四千三百多万人，占七省总人口约百分之二十六，其中缺衣无食无家可归的有好几百万人，因为饥饿害病而死的无可计数。这个比较说明了什么问题呢？它说明了在反动统治时期，天灾加上人祸，任何的自然灾害，都会给人民带来惨重的损失；而在人民政府领导下，尽管天灾严重，但由于我们的准备周全，组织有方，领导正确，灾害对人民的危害也会大大减轻的。
    当然，我们决不应该以此自满，放松警惕。根据气象预报，江淮水情在最近时期内还不会根本好转；即使水位不继续涨高，现有江水的宣泄也要一个相当时期后才能恢复正常水位，同时其它地区也应十分注意雨量北移后可能产生的新的水情。因此必须再接再厉，为最后战胜洪水而斗争到底。
    在长江、淮河紧张防汛的地区，要动员一切可以动员的人力物力，继续加强堤防，坚决防守。要防止长期紧张防汛后发生疲惫怠倦情绪；克服防汛队伍组织不精和分工混乱的现象；严密检查工程及堤防，加强管理及检修工作；并尽最大力量保护工矿生产和交通运输，务求不使中断，工矿企业也应及时作好预防水灾的一切准备工作。在已经遭受水涝灾害的地区，要依靠互助合作组织，组织群众生产自救，做好救济工作，减少群众的损失，并解除防汛民工对家庭的顾虑。在华北、东北和黄河流域等地区，也要提高警惕，反对麻痹情绪，及时检查和加强堤防，加强通讯及交通设备，准备好防汛器材，准备应付万一暴雨区北移后可能发生的各种情况。
    战胜洪水灾害应该是全体人民的任务，因此城市和工矿企业要尽力支援可能受灾和已经受灾的乡村。有些工厂担负了赶制防汛器械支援防汛排水的光荣任务，就应当保证它的完成和提前超额完成。有些地区的许多工人已经抽出时间到附近农村帮助农民防汛排水，还应当尽可能地发动更多的人参加这个工作。卫生工作者也应尽力给灾区以支援，防止灾区容易发生的疫病。一切非灾区的农村要尽力支援灾区。除了必要的人力物力（如防汛物资和排水后补种的种籽、受灾后的食粮等）支援以外，当前最重要的就是力争超额完成增产计划，以弥补灾区农业生产的损失，争取全国的农业增产计划在部分地区遭受灾害的情况下仍能胜利实现。
    做好防汛排涝工作，战胜今年的洪水，对于我们整个国家的社会主义建设有重大的关系。城市和农村、灾区和非灾区所有的干部和群众，为了我们共同的理想、共同的事业、共同的幸福，像一个和睦的大家庭一样，紧密地团结起来吧！再接再厉，为战胜洪水而斗争！
