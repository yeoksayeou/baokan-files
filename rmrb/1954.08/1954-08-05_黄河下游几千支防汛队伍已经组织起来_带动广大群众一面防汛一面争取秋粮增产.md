Thousands of flood prevention teams have been organized in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. People in Henan and Shandong provinces began to restore and establish this year's flood prevention organizations from the end of May and the beginning of June. Up to now, hundreds of thousands of people have formed thousands of flood prevention teams. These flood prevention teams are distributed along the Yellow River, and they are leading the broad masses to participate in flood prevention work.

Currently, the water level of the Yellow River maintains the stability of a normal flood season. The flood prevention teams on both sides of the river are sending some personnel to guard the dikes while actively engaging in agricultural production. At present, sentry posts for flood prevention are all over the dikes from Mengjin in Henan Province downwards. Long-term flood prevention workers who are familiar with water conditions are patrolling here day and night. They monitor changes in water conditions and protect the safety of the dikes during the flood season. Many temporary flood prevention workers, emergency rescue teams, and transportation teams are also busy on the vast plains stretching as far as the eye can see on both sides of the Yellow River. Within ten miles of the Yellow River dikes, every village has flood prevention team members preparing tools. In Dongming County, Henan Province, along the 140-mile-long dike line, more than 15,800 flood prevention workers are guarding this section of the dike without the slightest懈怠(xie dai). When the five mutual aid group leaders in Xiaonanbeizhuang, Lankao County, Henan Province, studied this year's flood prevention work, they realized the great significance of this year's flood prevention and national construction. After this realization they mobilized all members of the group to participate in flood prevention work and led the people of the whole village to participate in flood prevention work, quickly making preparations for flood prevention.

While stepping up flood prevention, the people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River are making efforts to increase autumn grain production. Farmers are actively applying fertilizer, eliminating insects, and carrying out the last summer hoeing in the fields. Early autumn crops in the fields are growing well. In order to ensure the harvest of autumn crops along the coast and support national industrial construction, these flood prevention team members are more vigilantly protecting the safety of the dikes.

    黄河下游几千支防汛队伍已经组织起来
    带动广大群众一面防汛一面争取秋粮增产
    黄河下游已经组织起几千支防汛队伍。河南省和山东省人民自五月底六月初就开始恢复和建立今年的防汛组织。到现在止，已经有几十万人民组成了几千支防汛队伍，这些防汛队伍分布在黄河沿岸，并带动了广大群众参加了防汛工作。
    目前，黄河水势保持着正常汛期的平稳。沿河两岸的防汛队伍一面派出一部分人员守护大堤，一面积极进行农业生产。目前，自河南省孟津以下的大堤上，布满了防汛的岗哨。熟悉水性的长期防汛员们不分昼夜地在这里巡守着。他们监视着水情的变化和保护大堤在汛期的安全。许许多多临时防汛员、抢险队和运输队员们，也正在黄河两岸一望无垠的辽阔平原上忙碌着。靠近黄河大堤十里以内，村村都有防汛队员在准备着工具。河南省东明县沿着一百四十里长的堤线上，一万五千八百多名防汛员，片刻也不松懈地防护着这段大堤。河南省兰考县小南北庄的五个互助组长在研究今年防汛工作时，认识到今年防汛和国家建设的重大意义后，发动全体组员都参加了防汛工作并带动全村人民参加防汛工作，迅速作好防汛准备。
    黄河下游人民一面加紧防汛，一面正在作秋粮增产的努力。农民们正在田间积极地进行追肥、除虫，进行最后一次夏锄。农田里的早秋作物生长良好。这些防汛队员们为了保证沿岸秋季作物的丰收，支援国家工业建设，更加警惕地保护着大堤的安全。（新华社）
