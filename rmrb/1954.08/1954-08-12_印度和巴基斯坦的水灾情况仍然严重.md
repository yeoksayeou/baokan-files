Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch:

    The flood situation in India and Pakistan remains serious, causing great losses to millions of people.

    In India, the Kosi River, Brahmaputra River, and Teesta River have overflowed, submerging many areas in the states of Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and others.

    According to the "Times of India," 8,000 villages in Bihar have been affected by the floods. The Gandak River changed its course due to levee breaches. A total of 460 miles of railway subgrade were washed away by the floodwaters. According to official figures cited by the Indian Information Bureau, the affected area in northern Bihar reached 9,900 square miles. According to materials from the Bihar government, the confirmed losses in the province due to the floods amount to 100 million rupees. The capital of Bihar, Patna, has received reports of large numbers of starving flood victims. It is said that this year's flood situation in Bihar is more serious than in 1883.

    Due to the rising waters of the Brahmaputra River, about 300,000 people in the Goalpara district of Assam have been affected. The Deputy Commissioner of Goalpara district said that more than 1,000 square miles of area have been greatly affected by the floods in June and July, with rice and jute suffering significant damage. In the 100 square mile area between Goalpara and Mankachar City, the water depth is still one foot.

    According to foreign news agencies, the Sekhuajagat area of West Bengal has become a vast expanse of water, with only railway markers, tall trees, and rooftops occasionally protruding above the water surface. In the Jalpaiguri district, approximately 50,000 people have been made homeless due to the floods.

    After the water levels of the Rapti River and Ghaghara River rose by six inches, more than 100 villages in the Deoria district of Uttar Pradesh have been submerged.

    According to a Reuters dispatch from Dhaka, more than 10 million people out of the 42 million in East Pakistan have been affected by the floods. The rising waters of the Buriganga River have paralyzed Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan. In many parts of this city with a population of 401,000, many houses have been washed away by the floodwaters.

    印度和巴基斯坦的水灾情况仍然严重
    【新华社十一日讯】印度和巴基斯坦的水灾情况仍然严重，千百万人民遭到很大的损失。
    在印度的柯西河、布拉马普得拉河和蒂斯塔河的河水泛滥，使比哈尔省、阿萨姆省、西孟加拉省、北方省以及其他省邦的许多地方浸没在大水中。
    据“印度时报”报道，由于水灾的影响，比哈尔省有八千个农村遭到灾害。干达克河因为堤防决口而改了道。全长四百六十英里的铁路路基被大水冲坏了。据印度新闻处引用的官方数字，比哈尔省北部受灾面积达九千九百平方英里。根据比哈尔省政府的材料，这个省由于水灾而遭到的损失确定有一亿卢比。比哈尔省省会巴特那接到了大批灾民挨饿的报告。据说，比哈尔省今年的水情比一八八三年的情况更为严重。
    由于布拉马普得拉河河水的上涨，阿萨姆省的戈尔帕拉地区约有三十万人受灾。戈尔帕拉地区的副专员说，有一千多平方英里的地区由于六月和七月的洪水而受灾很大，稻米和黄麻都遭到了很大的损害。在戈尔帕拉和曼卡查尔城之间的一百平方英里的地区水深现在仍达一英尺。
    据外国通讯社报道，西孟加拉省的塞科华加特地区已变成一片汪洋，只有铁路旁的指标，高树和屋顶偶然伸出在水面上。在贾尔派古里地区大约有五万人因受水灾而无家可归。
    在拉普蒂河和加加拉河的水位升高了六英寸以后，北方省的得俄里亚地区的一百多个村庄已浸没在大水中。
    据路透社达卡消息，在东巴基斯坦四千二百万人口中，遭受水灾的就有一千多万人。由于布里甘加河的河水上涨，已使东巴基斯坦首府达卡处于瘫痪状态。在这个拥有四十万一千人口的城市的许多地方，很多住屋已被大水冲走。
