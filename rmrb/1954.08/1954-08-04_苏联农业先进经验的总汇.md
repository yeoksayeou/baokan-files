A Summary of Advanced Soviet Agricultural Experience
By our reporter Li He

The Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, according to the decision of the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, opened as scheduled on August 1st in Moscow. At a time when the Soviet people are vigorously developing agriculture to meet the needs of communist construction, and when people's democratic countries are using the Soviet socialist agriculture as a model for developing their own agriculture, the establishment of this living university, which widely disseminates advanced agricultural experience, is indeed an exciting event. From the Far East to the Baltic coast, from Yakutsk to Turkmenistan, all parts of the Soviet Union have sent representatives—two from each collective farm, seven from each machine tractor station, four from each state farm, and several from other agricultural schools, scientific research institutions, and party and government organizations at the state and district levels—to visit and study at the exhibition. Delegations from the People's Republic of China and other countries are also coming to visit and study at this "university."

Visitors are converging on the northern suburbs of Moscow, heading towards the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition along the wide Yaroslavl Highway. This is a garden town composed of beautiful houses, squares, fountains, tree-lined avenues, and flowers and trees. Within this flower town, which covers an area of 207 hectares, are distributed 76 exhibition halls and nearly 300 buildings. 169,000 units and individuals have qualified to participate in the exhibition; including 3,911 collective farms, 1,306 state farms, 419 machine tractor stations and technical stations, 3,250 livestock farms, 154,916 advanced agricultural workers, and many institutions and organizations. These advanced enterprises and figures are models for the development of agriculture in the Soviet Union. Reaching their level would result in an unprecedented abundance of agricultural products. In terms of scale and impact, the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition is unparalleled in the world.

People pass through the magnificent entrance gate, on top of which stands a golden statue of a tractor driver and a female collective farm member holding wheat sheaves together. Seven pairs of fountains and green grass-covered tree-lined avenues lead people to the three-story square-towered General Exhibition Hall. This building, with a volume of 120,000 cubic meters and a height of 97 meters, is surrounded by giant columns, and the spire is adorned with the golden star of the Hero of Socialist Labor held by wheat ears, making it look very solemn and majestic. Inside the General Hall, divided into nine halls, are displayed various charts and materials, explaining the historical achievements of Soviet agriculture, the state industrialization as the basis for agricultural transformation and development, and the superiority of the collectivized socialist agricultural system. This is a powerful figure: In 1952-1953, the Soviet Union's commodity agricultural products increased greatly compared to 1926-1927: commodity grain increased from 10.3 million tons to 40.4 million tons; commodity potatoes increased from 3 million tons to 12.5 million tons; commodity meat (live weight) increased from 2.4 million tons to 13.2 million tons. This figure eloquently illustrates the great development prospects of agriculture after the implementation of collectivization and mechanization.

Passing the General Hall is the wide "Collective Farm Square." Two fountains in the square are competing to spray crystal-clear water, surrounded by the exhibition halls of the sixteen republics and the regions of the Russian Federal Republic—North Caucasus, Volga River Basin, Tatar Autonomous Republic, Central States, Bashkir Autonomous Republic, Moscow Oblast and its surrounding four states, Leningrad and the Northwest, Ural and Siberia, etc. The "Friendship of Peoples" Grand Fountain has golden wheat ears shining in the center, surrounded by golden statues of sixteen girls in national costumes. Another fountain is like a pot of jeweled flowers, under the splashing water, like a fairy tale world. The architecture of each exhibition hall has its own unique national style. Their exhibitions show the achievements of socialist agriculture in every republic without exception, in areas with the most different natural conditions, and the huge potential that each region has achieved in improving agricultural production.

In the exhibition halls of the Russian Federal Republic and its regions, people see the important position that Russia occupies in the development of agriculture in the Soviet Union. There are 70,000 exhibition participants in all of Russia, nearly 7,000 of which are enterprises and organizations. Russia produces 64 percent of the Soviet Union's total grain. The collective farms and state farms of the republic planted 68.1 million hectares of grain in 1953, of which winter wheat accounted for approximately 30 million hectares. The experience of the collective farms in Korenovsky District of Krasnodar Territory has received attention. In 1952 and 1953, the collective farms in the district averaged 2,180 kilograms of winter wheat per hectare on a vast area of 29,350 hectares. In the "Siberia," "Ural," "Volga River Basin," and "North Caucasus" pavilions, advanced experiences in reclaiming new land and increasing grain planting are widely introduced. Russia produces the most potatoes and vegetables in the entire Soviet Union. Compared with 1913, the potato planting area increased from 2 million hectares to 4.6 million hectares in 1953, and the vegetable planting area also expanded by one and a half times. People pay attention to the experience of animal husbandry in Kholmogorsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast. The 23 collective farms in this district have 9,350 cattle, of which 4,803 cows averaged 2,467 liters of milk per head in 1953. The "New Life" Collective Farm has an average of 17 cows per 100 hectares of cultivated land and pasture, with each cow producing 4,615 liters of milk.

In the exhibition hall of the Ukrainian Republic, people see the experience of this major Soviet winter wheat and sugar beet producing area. In 1952 and 1953, the Ospinsky District of Zaporozhye Oblast averaged 2,000 kilograms of winter wheat per hectare from a vast area of 28,000 hectares. The "Budyonny Collective Farm" in Berezovsky District of Odessa Oblast has averaged 2,000 to 2,700 kilograms of grain per hectare for the past fifteen years. In 1953, the republic had 136 production teams that harvested more than 50,000 kilograms of sugar beets per hectare. The number of agricultural laborers in the Ukrainian Republic who have qualified to participate in the exhibition ranks second in the entire Soviet Union.

In the exhibition hall of the Kazakh Republic, the experience of large-scale reclamation of new land is particularly attractive to people. In Kokchetav Oblast, more than 2,900 kilograms of wheat were harvested per hectare on the reclaimed new land. The republic has 1,699 collective farms, 283 machine tractor stations, 122 original state farms, and 92 newly established state farms engaged in the reclamation of new land. The exhibition hall shows that Kazakhstan is one of the bases of grain and animal husbandry in the eastern Soviet Union. Comrade Ibrahim Chakhayev, a member of the "Kyzyl-Du" Collective Farm in the Chirilis District of Kyzyl-Orda Oblast, harvested 7,000 kilograms of rice per hectare from 20 hectares of paddy fields in 1953. The "Red Mountain Eagle" Collective Farm in Semipalatinsk Oblast collected 168 kilograms of wool per 100 hectares of cultivated land and pasture in 1953, with more than 21,000 fine-wool and semi-fine-wool sheep, and handed over 70,000 kilograms of wool to the state.

In the exhibition halls of the Central Asian republics—Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan—the experience of cotton planting is of most interest. The "Sverdlov" Collective Farm in Kerki District, Uzbekistan, has harvested 3,800 kilograms of seed cotton per hectare on a vast area of 790 hectares in the past two years. The "Moscow" Collective Farm in the October District of Tajikistan has harvested 3,320 kilograms of fine-staple seed cotton per hectare on 440 hectares of cotton fields in the past two years.

In the exhibition halls of the South Caucasus republics, the experience of planting grapes, tea, and cotton is more prominent. The "Truth" Collective Farm in Lenkoran District of the Azerbaijan Republic, which I visited two years ago, has become a participant in the exhibition. The "Truth" Collective Farm has harvested 2,000 to 3,500 kilograms of tea per hectare of tea fields. The "Lenin Collective Farm" in Makharadze District of the Georgian Republic harvested about 6,000 kilograms of tea per hectare on 192.7 hectares of farmland.

After viewing the exhibition halls of the sixteen republics, people arrived at "Mechanization Square." In the middle of the square lies a large mirror-like pool, and behind the pool stands the oval-domed "Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification" Exhibition Hall. This is the largest exhibition hall in the exhibition, and also one of the most beautiful. It is made of reinforced concrete and glass. In its 26 halls with an area of 18,000 square meters, people can fully appreciate the majestic power of advanced agricultural machinery based on a strong industry.

Tractors—this is the most widely used "steel bull and iron horse" in the Soviet countryside. In 1928, the Soviet Union had only 26,700 tractors working in the fields, 530,000 in 1940, and now it has increased to 1.3 million, and another 500,000 will be added by 1957! Not only the number of tractors, but also their efficiency has undergone tremendous changes. The Soviet Union has long stopped producing wheeled tractors and replaced them with powerful tracked diesel tractors. Here you can see "C-80," "DT-54," and "KD-35" tracked tractors. They save half the fuel compared to wheeled tractors and greatly increase labor productivity. Also on display are various tractors for intercropping crops, orchards, vegetable gardens, and vineyards.

The pavilion displays new types of sowing and plowing machines. There are tractor-drawn shallow cultivators, soil tillers, plows, and harrows. Some seeders can simultaneously sow grain and pasture seeds separately. Some seeders can sow grain seeds and apply mineral fertilizers at the same time. Some seeders can sow sugar beet seeds or grain seeds with mineral fertilizers. There are also close-row and square-cluster seeders for sowing sunflowers and corn. There are many hanging machines that are lighter than traction machines. They are closely connected to the back of the tractor, becoming the rear part of the tractor, without adding a driver. The hanging "COH-2.8" vegetable seeder can sow 1.4 hectares per hour. The hanging potato field cultivator and earther can fertilize, weed, and loosen the soil at the same time. There are also hanging weeding and seedling protection machines, weeding and fertilizing machines, and planting machines.

Inside and outside the pavilion are fascinating combine harvesters. It is these machines that have forever liberated farmers from the heavy labor of manual harvesting and threshing. There are now more than 300,000 combine harvesters working in the Soviet fields. Also active in the Soviet fields are highly efficient flax harvesters, sugar beet harvesters, corn harvesters, potato harvesters, and pasture harvesters. They are all displayed in front of visitors. Near the harvesters are threshers, winnowers, grain loaders, and grain dryers. Machines lighten agricultural labor. There is the "CXM-48-M" cotton picker, which can pick up to 4,000 kilograms of cotton per day, while the most skilled manual cotton picker can only pick 100 to 120 kilograms of cotton per day. That is to say, one such machine can replace the labor of forty people.

Powerful machines for reclaiming virgin and uncultivated land and draining swamps attract visitors. People also see machines for mowing grass, cooking and delivering feed, milking cows, and shearing sheep, many of which are new.

Airplanes are also parked inside and outside the exhibition hall. Airplanes are used to spray pesticides to kill crop diseases and insect pests, to apply fertilizers, to spray pesticides to promote cotton plant defoliation in order to pick cotton early, and to sow grass and trees on sandy land.

The "Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification" Pavilion exhibits 1,200 agricultural machines, tools, and other machines, more than 200 of which were manufactured by Soviet designers and factories in the post-war period. The high level of agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union is based on the developed heavy industry, especially the tractor and automobile industry. The pavilion has a special section introducing the achievements of Soviet industrialization, and also a special section exhibiting the finished products of the Tractor and Automobile Industry Department.

Electricity is playing an increasingly important role in Soviet rural production and life. The situation of agricultural electrification is also widely exhibited here. From hydroelectric generators to televisions are performed here. Electric tractors have begun to be used in Soviet fields.

The decisive role played by mechanization and electrification in the development of agriculture can be seen by anyone here. Therefore, appropriately, on the front wall of the airship-style glass hall in the pavilion is a group of statues, under the light of the five-pointed star, holding high the banners of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, victoriously advancing towards communism.

The advanced machine tractor stations that serve the collective farms well by using agricultural machines are exchanging experiences such as square-cluster planting methods for intercropping crops at the exhibition. The Kuban Big Bear Machine Tractor Station, which I visited two years ago, is at the forefront of the participants in this exhibition. It cooperates with collective farms, masters the rotation of grain and pasture crops well, and in 1953, it averaged approximately 2,300 kilograms of winter wheat and 2,200 kilograms of sunflowers per hectare on a vast area, and helped the collective farms to prepare feed well. It guarantees a harvest of 2,700 kilograms per hectare of wheat land and 2,400 kilograms per hectare of sunflower land this year.

Surrounding "Mechanization Square," to the right of the "Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification" Pavilion are the "Agronomy" Pavilion and the "State Farm" Pavilion, and to the left are the "Animal Husbandry" Pavilion and the "Grain" Pavilion. Behind the "Agronomy" Pavilion are the various exhibition halls for vegetables and potatoes, cotton, flax, oil crops and technical crops, sugar beets, horticulture, floriculture, grapes and winemaking, forestry, sericulture, and beekeeping. Behind the "Animal Husbandry" Pavilion are the cattle, horse, pig, sheep, and chicken farms, veterinary medicine and animal husbandry technology, and the various exhibition halls for poultry farming, rabbit farming, hunting and deer farming, fox farming, fish farming, and dog breeding. Behind the "Grain" Pavilion are the "Collective Farm Hydropower Station" Exhibition Hall, the typical buildings of machine tractor stations—from repair shops and sheds to oil depots, etc., the field stations of tractor teams, and the typical buildings of the countryside—township soviets, collective farm management departments, collective farm clubs, schools, kindergartens, nurseries, post and telecommunications offices, shops, etc. Here, people feel like they are in the Soviet countryside.

The "Agronomy" Pavilion exhibits the achievements of the Soviet Union in agricultural science. Seed selection is the focus of attention. A large number of good varieties are displayed here. The attention paid by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, national seed selection stations, experimental stations, and experimental fields to the work of breeding new varieties, improving old varieties, and propagating good varieties is admirable. More than 350 excellent varieties of grains can be seen at the exhibition, which were bred by Soviet seed selection workers. For example, No. 1 hybrid wheat can produce more than 7,000 kilograms per hectare on many fertile soils. Hybrid varieties do not fall over when they grow plump, which is convenient for machine harvesting. Various hybrid varieties of wheat are cultivated in eleven states in the Soviet Union. Approximately 200,000 hectares of land are planted with them.

In the exhibition halls of various crops, people noticed the experience of various advanced units and figures. In the "Grain" Pavilion, the collective farms in Bashtanka District of Nikolaev Oblast, Ukrainian Republic, harvested 2,770 kilograms of winter wheat per hectare. In the "State Farm" Pavilion, the Petrov-Pavlovsk Grain State Farm in Chelyabinsk Oblast harvested 2,200 to 2,500 kilograms of spring wheat per hectare on reclaimed virgin and uncultivated land. In the "Cotton" Pavilion, the Tengiz District of the Uzbek Republic harvested 3,340 kilograms of cotton per hectare in the entire district in 1953, with advanced collective farms exceeding 4,000 kilograms. In the "Potatoes and Vegetables" Pavilion, Yeremakova, the leader of the production team of the Borodino Collective Farm in Moscow Oblast, harvested 40,000 kilograms of potatoes per hectare, and the Voroshilov Collective Farm in Ukhtom District of Moscow Oblast harvested 61,800 kilograms of carrots and 42,000 kilograms of early cabbage and tomatoes per hectare. In the "Flax, Hemp and Other Hemp Fiber Crops" Pavilion, the "New Life" Collective Farm in Kalinin Oblast harvests no less than 600 kilograms of flax fiber per hectare every year. In the "Oil Crops and Technical Crops" Pavilion, Comrade Kashinecha, the leader of the production team of the Lenin Collective Farm in Transcarpathian Oblast of the Ukrainian Republic, harvested 3,120 kilograms of sunflowers per hectare in 1953. In the "Horticulture" Pavilion, the Kantsevic production team of the Moldavian Republic produced 26,200 kilograms of apples per hectare. In the "Grapes and Winemaking" Pavilion, the Biruintsa Collective Farm in Moldavia planted 135 varieties of grapes on 858 hectares of land. Not far from the "Horticulture" Pavilion, a green forest stretches, which is the Michurin Orchard. More than 560 kinds of fruit and berry trees grow on more than 6 hectares of orchard, with dozens of kinds of apple trees alone.

The animal husbandry section of the exhibition shows people the great achievements and prospects of Soviet animal husbandry. The supply of meat, milk, wool, and leather, which are important parts of the food and supplies of the Soviet residents, depends on this developed animal husbandry. In the General Hall, people have seen such figures: Compared with 1945, the Soviet Union's cattle increased by 11.3 million head, pigs increased by 25.1 million head, and sheep increased by 53.9 million head in 1953. 2,500 heads of fine breed livestock and 8,000 poultry were transported from the advanced farms to the various livestock farms. Here, people see fine breeds of horses, strong cattle, fine-wool sheep, and fat pigs. From the exhibition, people know that: a cow raised in Kostroma Oblast produces more than 13,000 liters of milk in a year; a sheep raised in Stavropol Territory weighs 126 kilograms and produces 23.2 kilograms of fine wool per year; a castrated pig raised in Krasnodar Territory weighs 530 kilograms; a stallion from Arzamas Oblast can pull about 15 and a half tons of goods; a stallion raised in Moscow Oblast can walk 1,600 meters in two minutes and eight seconds.

At the end of the exhibition are three connecting pools and a rest area. In the middle of the middle pool stands a fountain in the shape of golden ears of wheat.

It takes a whole day to walk around the exhibition, even if it is just to take a glance. According to insiders, it takes a week to visit it a little more carefully. The exhibition not only gives people a comprehensive picture of the great socialist agriculture, but also gives people the wonderful art of Soviet national architecture. (Attached pictures)

    苏联农业先进经验的总汇
    本报记者　李何
    苏联农业展览会，按照苏联政府和共产党中央的决定，已如期于八月一日在莫斯科开幕了。在苏联人民沸腾地大力进一步发展农业以适应共产主义建设的需要的时候，在人民民主国家以苏联的社会主义农业为发展自己农业的榜样的时候，这个广泛地传播农业先进经验的活的大学的成立，真是令人兴奋的大事。从远东到波罗的海沿岸，从雅库茨到土库曼，全苏各地都派代表——每个集体农庄派两个，每个机器拖拉机站派七个，每个国营农场派四个，其他农业学校、科学研究机关以及州、区的党政组织都派若干代表到展览会来参观学习。来这个“大学”参观学习的还有中华人民共和国和各国的代表团。
    参观的人们汇流向莫斯科北郊，沿着宽阔的雅罗斯拉夫大道走向苏联农业展览会。这是一座由漂亮的房屋、广场、喷泉、林荫道和花木组成的花园镇。在这座占地二百零七公顷的花镇内，分布着七十六所展览馆和近三百所建筑物。获得参加展览会资格的有十六万九千个单位和个人；包括三千九百一十一个集体农庄，一千三百零六个国营农场，四百十九个机器拖拉机站和技术站，三千二百五十个饲畜场，十五万四千九百一十六个农业先进工作者和许多机关与组织。这些先进的企业和人物，是苏联发展农业的模范。达到他们的水平，就可以有空前丰富的农业品。从规模和作用来说，苏联农业展览会是世界上无与伦比的。
    人们走过宏壮的入口门坊，坊顶立着共举麦捆的拖拉机手和集体农庄女庄员的金黄雕像。七对喷泉和绿草铺成的林荫道把人们引到三层方塔式的总展览馆去。这个体积十二万立方公尺、高九十七公尺的建筑物，四周排列着巨柱，塔尖闪耀着麦穗托的社会主义劳动英雄的金星，显得十分庄严宏伟。总馆内分九个厅，陈列着各种图表材料，说明苏联农业的历史成就，说明国家工业化是农业改造和发展的基础，说明集体化的社会主义农业制度的优越性。这是一个有力的数字：在一九五二——一九五三年，苏联的商品农产品，比在一九二六——一九二七年大大增加：商品谷物从一千零三十万吨增加到四千零四十万吨；商品马铃薯从三百万吨增加到一千二百五十万吨；商品肉类（活重）从二百四十万吨增加到一千三百二十万吨。这个数字雄辩地说明了实行了集体化机械化后的农业有着多么伟大的发展前途。
    过了总馆是宽阔的“集体农庄广场”。广场上两个喷泉在竞射晶莹的水花，四周散布着十六个加盟共和国展览馆和俄罗斯联邦共和国各地区——北高加索、伏尔加河流域、鞑靼自治共和国、中央各州、巴什基尔自治共和国、莫斯科州及其附近四个州、列宁格勒和西北、乌拉尔和西伯利亚等展览馆。“各民族友好”大喷泉中央闪耀着金麦穗，周围环立着穿着民族服装的十六个女郎金像，另一个喷泉像一盆宝石花，在水花溅射下，如同童话世界。各展览馆的建筑具有各民族独特的风格。它们的展览，表示社会主义农业无例外地在各个共和国，在自然条件最不相同的地区的成就，表示各地在提高农业生产上所获得的巨大潜力。
    在俄罗斯联邦共和国及其地区展览馆，人们看到俄罗斯在苏联发展农业中所占的重要地位。全俄罗斯有七万个展览会参加者，其中近七千个是企业和组织。俄罗斯出产着全苏联百分之六十四的谷物，共和国的集体农庄和国营农场在一九五三年种了六千八百一十万公顷谷物，其中冬小麦约三千万公顷。克拉斯诺达尔边疆区科连诺夫斯基区全区集体农庄的经验受到重视。全区集体农庄在一九五二年和一九五三年在二万九千三百五十公顷广大土地上平均每公顷收获了二千一百八十公斤冬小麦。在“西伯利亚”、“乌拉尔”、“伏尔加河流域”，“北高加索”各馆，广泛地介绍着开垦新地增种谷物的先进经验。俄罗斯在全苏联生产最多的马铃薯和蔬菜。以一九五三年与一九一三年比较，马铃薯种植面积从两百万公顷提高到四百六十万公顷，蔬菜种植面积也扩大一倍半。人们重视阿罕格尔州贺尔摩高尔区饲畜业的经验。这个区的二十三个集体农庄有九千三百五十头牛，其中四千八百零三头母牛在一九五三年平均每头挤二千四百六十七公升牛奶。“新生活”集体农庄平均每一百公顷耕地和牧场有十七头母牛，每头挤四千六百一十五公升牛奶。
    在乌克兰共和国展览馆，人们看到这个苏联冬小麦和甜菜主要产区之一的经验。查坡罗什州奥斯平斯基区在一九五二年和一九五三年从二万八千公顷广大土地上平均每公顷收获了二千公斤冬小麦。敖德萨州别列佐夫斯基区“布琼尼集体农庄”十五年来平均每公顷土地收获了二千到二千七百公斤谷物。共和国在一九五三年有一百三十六个生产组从每公顷土地上收获了五万公斤以上的甜菜。乌克兰共和国农业劳动者取得参加展览会资格的数目，占全苏第二位。
    在哈萨克共和国展览馆，特别吸引人们注意的是大规模开垦新地的经验。科克切诺夫州在开垦的新地上每公顷收获了二千九百公斤以上的小麦。共和国有一千六百九十九个集体农庄，二百八十三个机器拖拉机站，一百二十二个原有的国营农场和九十二个新成立的国营农场从事开垦新地的工作。展览馆显出哈萨克斯坦是苏联东部谷物和饲畜业的基地之一。克兹尔·奥尔金州齐里斯基区“克兹尔·都”集体农庄的庄员伊布拉伊·查哈也夫在一九五三年从二十公顷稻田上每公顷收稻七千公斤。西米巴拉丁州“红山鹰”集体农庄在一九五三年从每一百公顷耕地和牧场上收了一百六十八公斤羊毛，细毛羊和半细毛羊超过了二万一千只，交给了国家七万公斤羊毛。
    在中亚细亚各共和国——乌兹别克、土库曼、塔吉克、基尔吉兹各展览馆，最有兴趣的是种棉的经验。乌兹别克共和国克治张州“斯维尔德洛夫”集体农庄最近两年在七百九十公顷广大土地上每公顷采了三千八百公斤籽棉。塔吉克共和国十月区“莫斯科”集体农庄最近两年在四百四十公顷棉田上每公顷采三千三百二十公斤细绒籽棉。
    在南高加索各共和国展览馆，葡萄、茶、棉的种植经验比较突出。两年前我访问过的阿塞拜疆共和国连科苏区“真理”集体农庄成为展览会的参加者。“真理”集体农庄从每公顷茶田采了二千到三千五百公斤的茶叶。格鲁吉亚共和国马哈拉前夫区
  “列宁集体农庄”在一百九十二点七公顷庄田上每公顷采了约六千斤茶叶。
    看完十六个共和国各展览馆，人们到了“机械化广场”。广场当中躺着一面镜子似的大池，池背立着椭圆顶的“农业机械化和电气化”展览馆。这是展览会中最大的展览馆，也是最美丽的一个。它是用钢筋混凝土与玻璃盖成的。在它一万八千平方公尺面积的二十六个厅中，人们尽情地领略了以强大的工业为基础的先进农业机器的雄伟力量。
    拖拉机——这是苏联农村中使用最广的“钢牛铁马”。在一九二八年苏联只有二万六千七百台拖拉机在田间工作，一九四○年有五十三万台，现增加到一百三十万台，到一九五七年还要补充五十万台！不仅拖拉机的数量，而且它的效能都起着飞跃的变化。苏联已经早就不出车轮拖拉机，而代替以强大的履带柴油拖拉机了。在这里看到“C—80”，“DT—54”，“KD—35”式履带拖拉机。它们比车轮拖拉机省一半燃料，把劳动生产率提高很多。这里也陈列着中耕作物、果园、菜园、葡萄园用的各式拖拉机。
    馆内展览着新式的播种和犁地的机器。有拖拉机牵引的浅耕机、耘土机、犁、耙。有的播种机可以同时分别地播种谷物和牧草的种籽。有的播种机可以一面播谷物种籽一面施矿质肥料。有的播种机可以播种带着矿肥的甜菜种籽或谷物种籽。也有播种向日葵和玉米用的密行和方形簇种机。有许多比牵引机更轻便的吊挂机。它们紧接在拖拉机后面，成为拖拉机的后部，不用添人驾驶。吊挂的“COH—2·8”式蔬菜播种机每小时能播种一点四公顷。吊挂的马铃薯田耘土培土机同时能施肥、除草和松土。还有吊挂的耘土保苗机、耘土施肥机、植苗机。
    馆内和馆外摆着迷人的联合收割机。就是这机器使农民永远从手工割禾和打禾的沉重劳动下解放出来。现在苏联田间有三十多万台联合收割机在工作。在苏联田间也活动着效能很高的亚麻收割机、甜菜收割机、玉米收割机、马铃薯收割机、牧草收割机。它们都陈列在参观者的眼前。在收割机附近还有打谷机、簸谷机、谷物装卸机、谷物烘干机。机器减轻了农业劳动。这里有“CXM—48—M”采棉机，每天可以采棉到四千公斤，而最熟练的手工采棉者每天只能采一百到一百二十公斤棉花。这就是说，一台这样机器可以代替四十人的劳动。
    开垦生熟荒地和疏干沼地用的强大机器吸引着参观者。人们也看到割草、煮送饲料、挤牛奶、剪羊毛的机器，其中有许多是新式的。
    展览馆里面和外面还停着飞机。飞机是用来撒药扑灭农作物的病虫害，用来施放肥料，用来撒药促使棉株落叶以便提前采棉，用来在沙地上播种草木的。
    “农业机械化和电气化”馆展览着一千二百件农机农具和其他机器，其中二百多种是苏联设计师和工厂在战后时期制造的。苏联农业机械化达到这样高的境界，是有发达的重工业特别是拖拉机和汽车工业为根据的。馆内有专门部分介绍苏联工业化的成就，也有专门部分展览拖拉机和汽车工业部的成品。
    电力在苏联农村生产和生活中的需要日益增长。农业电气化情形在这里也广泛地展览着。从水力发电机到电视机都在这里表演。电力拖拉机已经在苏联田间开始使用。
    机械化和电气化对于发展农业所起的决定作用，在这里谁也可以看见。因此，很合适的，在馆内气艇式玻璃大厅的正面壁上有一群塑像，在五角星的光芒照耀下，高举马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的旗帜，胜利地向共产主义前进。
    使用农业机器很好地为集体农庄服务的先进机器拖拉机站，在展览会交流如像中耕作物方形簇种法等等经验。两年前我曾访问过的库班大熊机器拖拉机站占在这次展览会参加者的前列。它与集体农庄合作，很好地掌握谷物和牧草的轮种，一九五三年在广大土地上平均每公顷收获了约二千三百公斤冬小麦，二千二百公斤向日葵，很好地帮助各集体农庄准备饲料。它保证今年每公顷小麦地收获二千七百公斤，向日葵地二千四百公斤。
    围绕着“机械化广场”，在“农业机械化和电气化”馆的右手是“农艺”馆和“国营农场”馆，左手是“饲畜”馆和“谷物”馆。“农艺”馆后面有蔬菜和马铃薯、棉、麻、油料作物和技术作物、甜菜、园艺、花艺、葡萄与酿酒、林艺、养蚕、养蜂等各个展览馆。在“饲畜”馆后面有牛、马、猪、羊、鸡各饲养场，兽医和饲畜技术，养家禽、养兔、打猎和养鹿、养狐、养鱼、养狗各展览馆。在
  “谷物”馆后面有“集体农庄水电站”展览馆，机器拖拉机站的典型建筑物——从修理厂、车棚到油库等等，拖拉机队的田间站，还有农村的典型建筑物——乡苏维埃、集体农庄管理部、集体农庄俱乐部、学校、幼儿园、托儿所、邮电局、商店等等。到这里，人们就像置身在苏联农村里一样。
      “农艺”馆展览着苏联在农业科学方面的成就。选种是受注意的中心。这里陈列着繁多的好品种。苏联科学研究院、国家选种站、实验站、实验田对于培育新品种，改进旧品种和繁殖好品种的工作的重视，是令人钦佩的。在展览会上可以看到三百五十多个谷物的优良品种，它们是苏联选种工作者培育出来的。例如第一号杂交小麦在很多耕作的肥沃土壤上每公顷可以产七千公斤以上。杂交品种长得丰满时不倒伏，便于机器收割。各杂交品种的小麦在苏联十一个州培植。约有二十万公顷土地种它们。
    在农作物各展览馆，人们注意到各先进单位和人物的经验。在“谷物”馆，乌克兰共和国尼古拉夫州巴什坦区各集体农庄，从每公顷土地上收获了二千七百七十公斤冬小麦。在“国营农场”馆，车里雅宾斯克州彼得罗巴甫洛夫斯基谷物国营农场在开垦的生熟荒地上每公顷收获了二千二百到二千五百公斤春小麦。在“棉花”馆，乌兹别克共和国捷纳乌区在一九五三年全区从每公顷土地采了三千三百四十公斤棉花，其中先进的集体农庄超过四千公斤，在“马铃薯和蔬菜”馆，莫斯科州波罗金诺集体农庄生产组长叶尔马科娃从每公顷土地收获了四万公斤马铃薯，莫斯科州乌赫托木区伏罗希洛夫集体农庄从每公顷土地收获了六万一千八百公斤胡萝卜，四万二千公斤早熟白菜和西红柿，在“亚麻、大麻和其他麻纤维作物”馆，加里宁州“新生活”集体农庄年年从每公顷土地上收获不下六百公斤的亚麻纤维。在“油料作物和技术作物”馆，乌克兰共和国外喀尔巴阡州列宁集体农庄生产组长加新涅查，在一九五三年从每公顷土地收获了三千一百二十公斤向日葵，在“园艺”馆，摩尔达维亚共和国康采维奇生产队在每公顷土地上生产了二万六千二百公斤苹果，在“葡萄与酿酒”馆，摩尔达维亚比鲁因查集体农庄在八百五十八公顷土地上种了一百三十五种品种的葡萄，离“园艺”馆不远，伸展着一片绿林，这是米丘林果园，在六公顷多的园地上长着五百六十种水果和浆果树，仅仅苹果树就有几十种。
    饲畜部分的展览，使人们看到苏联饲畜业的巨大成就和前途。占苏联居民食品和用品中重要部分的肉、乳、毛、皮的供应，就是靠这发达的饲畜业的。在总馆里人们已看到这样的数字：以一九五三年比一九四五年，苏联的牛增加了一千一百三十万头，猪增加了二千五百一十万头，羊增加了五千三百九十万头。在各饲畜场由先进农庄农场运来了二千五百头良种家畜和八千只家禽。在这里，人们看到良种的马，硕壮的牛，细毛的羊，肥大的猪。从展览会上人们知道：有一头科斯特罗木州养的母牛一年内产一万三千多公升牛奶；有一头斯塔甫罗波尔边疆区养的绵羊，活重一百二十六公斤，年产细毛二十三点二公斤；有一头克拉斯诺达尔边疆区养的阉猪，活重五百三十公斤；有一头阿尔查马斯州出的公马能拉约十五吨半的货物；有一匹莫斯科州养的公马能在二分八秒钟内走一千六百公尺。
    展览会最后是三个衔接的池子和休息地带。中间池子当中立着金穗形状的喷泉。
    走遍展览会，那怕是看一眼，也要花上一整天。据内行人说，要稍为仔细地参观一下，需要一个星期的时间。展览会不但给人们以伟大的社会主义农业的全面图画，而且给人们以苏联各民族建筑的精彩艺术。（附图片）
