Literary and Art Workers in Wuhan and Other Places Actively Participate in Flood Control Struggle

The literary and art workers in Wuhan are now actively participating in the flood control and consolation activities in Wuhan. On July 6th, the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Circles issued an open letter, calling on all literary and art workers in the city to actively participate in the flood control struggle and to write works that promptly reflect the flood control struggle. At the same time, the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Culture and the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles also established a cultural service team for flood control sites, organizing film and opera workers to carry out cultural and artistic activities at the flood control sites. The Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Culture and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles also organized a group of literary, art, and music workers to go deep into various work sections to assist in carrying out literary and artistic propaganda and mobilization work in the work sections. In a very short period of time, they created many short, concise literary and artistic works and performance materials that portrayed the heroic struggle of the flood control soldiers. Eight film projection teams drawn from various units screened nine films, including "Be Sure to Harness the Huai River Well" and "Moscow Under Construction," in rotation at various work sections; opera and acrobatics performers also brought their best programs to the construction sites.

Literary and art workers from Central-South and Wuhan also actively participated in the flood control consolation teams organized by Central-South, Hubei, and Wuhan. The participating units included: the Song and Dance Troupe of the Central-South People's Art Theater, the Ethnic Song and Dance Troupe of the Central-South Institute for Nationalities, Wuhan Jing, Han, and Chu Opera Troupes, Acrobatics Troupe, Quyi Team, Workers' Cultural Service Team Quyi Team, and the Opera Reform Association, forming a total of ten literary and art work groups to conduct consolation performances on the front lines of flood control. From July 23rd to July 31st, this literary and art team performed over 130 programs and 216 shows in more than 20 work sections, with approximately 124,600 people seeing the performances of the art troupes.

In the tense flood control struggle, the literary and art workers in Wuhan not only reflected the heroic qualities of the soldiers on the front lines of flood control through literary and artistic creation, boosted morale, and enlivened the cultural and recreational life of the flood control work sections, but also received a patriotic and collectivist education themselves. The actors said: "Until you come to the dike, you don't know the severity of the flood situation, and you don't know the hardship of working on the dike. If it weren't for the flood control army guarding us day and night, risking their lives, how could the rear be so safe?" Based on this kind of thinking, the members of the art troupes dedicated all their strength and enthusiasm, overcame various difficulties, and basically achieved "responsiveness to all requests and guaranteed satisfaction." Many actors participated in arduous rescue work while continuing to perform. The Hanyang Chu Opera Troupe No. 2, led by the head of the troupe, Li Yaqiao, and Guan Xiaobin, participated in the rescue work at the sleeper anti-corrosion factory and Guishan Mountain, undertaking the labor of transporting stones, moving sleepers, and carrying mud bags. The Second Sub-troupe, the Han Opera Troupe No. 2, led by the head of the troupe, Chen Bohua, rescued a civilian ship fully loaded with wheat that was about to sink in the Xiang River in the wind and rain, saving more than 200 bags of grain. Many comrades from the Wuchang Sub-troupe, the Peking Opera Troupe No. 2, also participated in the rescue work under the leadership of the head of the troupe, Chen Hefeng. Many comrades bravely jumped into the water to help the victims rescue their belongings. (Fan Gang)

A large number of cultural workers in Echeng, Hubei, also joined the flood control battle. During the day, they worked alongside the 100,000 flood control laborers on the river embankment and collected the heroic flood control deeds of the laborers. At night, they compiled them into clapper rhymes and folk songs, which quickly spread among the laborers. In addition, the laborers could not only see slides and hear music broadcast by wired broadcasting on the tense flood control sites, but also see the condolence groups singing operas as soon as they took a break. These cultural and recreational activities made the laborers' morale more vigorous, and all the laborers in the 12th district guaranteed to carry one more load of earth per person per day to repay the comrades' condolences.

More than 200 opera performers and amateur literary and art activists in Bengbu City, Anhui Province, put forward the slogan "Walk from the stage to the dike, and comfort the guardians of the safety of the people of the city" in the tense flood control work, and automatically organized the Bengbu Literary and Art Circle Consolation Team to go to the dike to conduct consolation performances for flood control cadres, laborers, and soldiers.

The participants in the consolation performances included all the folk quyi performers who were learning new lyrics, as well as some actors from the Bengbu People's Peking Opera Troupe, Huaisheng Bangzi Opera Troupe, Sizhou Opera Huaiguang Troupe, and the Shangqiu Special District Drama Reform Experimental Work Troupe of Henan Province, which was touring in Bengbu City.

During the consolation performance activities, artists Wang Sumei, Shi Xiulan, and Sizhou opera actress Huang Weixia all left their babies who needed to be breastfed at home, asking others to take care of them, and insisted on going to the dike. Folk artists and amateur literary and art activists organized three groups, going to the dike day and night in the rain. The consolation activities greatly encouraged the laborers and soldiers on the dike. The red flag of the consolation team was warmly applauded and welcomed every time it appeared on the construction site. The laborers said: "When the consolation team comes, everyone is energetic in their work!" The soldiers shouted slogans: "Thank you for the people's condolences, we are determined to ensure the safety of the Bengbu Huai Dike!"

    武汉等地文艺工作者积极参加防汛斗争
    武汉市的文艺工作者现正积极参加武汉市的防汛慰问活动。七月六日，武汉市文学艺术工作者联合会发布了公开信，号召全市文艺工作者积极参加防汛斗争，并写作及时反映防汛斗争的作品；同时武汉市文化局、市文学艺术界联合会，还成立了防汛工地文化服务队，组织电影、戏曲工作者到防汛工地展开文化艺术活动。武汉市文化局、文学艺术界联合会并组织一批文学、美术、音乐工作者深入到各个工段，协助开展工段的文艺宣传鼓动工作，并在很短的时期内，创作了不少短小精悍的、表现防汛战士英勇斗争的文艺作品和演唱材料。从各单位抽调的八个电影放映队，在各个工段上轮流映出了“一定要把淮河修好”、“莫斯科在建设中”等九部影片；戏曲、杂技演员也把自己最好的节目带到了工地。
    中南、武汉市文艺工作者并积极参加了中南、湖北、武汉组织的防汛慰问队伍，参加的单位有：中南人民艺术剧院歌舞团、中南民族学院民族歌舞团、武汉市京、汉、楚剧团、杂技团、曲艺队、工人文化服务队曲艺队、戏曲改进协会等，共组成了十个文艺工作团，到各防汛前线进行慰问演出。从七月二十三日到七月三十一日，这支文艺队伍在二十多个工段演出了一百三十多个节目，二百一十六场，约有十二万四千六百多人次看到了文工团的演出。
    武汉市文学艺术工作者在紧张的防汛斗争中，不仅通过文艺创作，反映了防汛前方战士的英雄品质，鼓舞了战斗士气，活跃了防汛工段的文娱生活，本身也受到了一次爱国主义和集体主义教育。演员们说：“不到堤上来不晓得水情的严重，不晓得堤上工作的艰苦。要不是防汛大军夜以继日的、奋不顾身地保卫我们，后方那能这样安全。”在这样思想基础上，文工团员们都献出了自己的全部力量与热情，克服了各种困难，基本上做到了“有求必应、保证满意”。许多演员一边坚持演出，一边还参加了艰巨的抢险工作。汉阳楚剧二团在团长李雅樵、关啸彬带领下，参加了枕木防腐厂和龟山的抢险工作，担负了运石头、搬枕木、背泥包的劳动。第二分团汉剧二团在陈伯华团长的带动下，在风雨中抢救了襄河里正要沉底的满载小麦的民船，抢救了二百多袋粮食。武昌分团京剧二团许多同志，在团长陈鹤峰的带领下，也参加了抢险工作，不少同志奋勇跳入水中，帮助灾民抢救物件。　　（范刚）

    湖北鄂城的大批文化工作者也投入防汛战斗。白天他们和江堤上的十万防汛民工一同劳动，并收集民工们英勇的防汛事迹，晚上就编成快板和山歌，这些很快便在民工中流传开来。此外，民工们在紧张的防汛工地上不但能看到幻灯、听到有线广播播送的乐曲，而且刚一休息下来，便能看到慰问小组演唱的戏。这些文娱活动使民工们的斗志更加旺盛，十二区全区民工们保证每人每天多挑一担土来回敬同志们的慰问。

    安徽省蚌埠市戏曲艺人和业余文艺活动分子二百多人，在紧张的防汛工作中，提出“从舞台走上堤坝，慰问全市人民安全的保卫者”的口号，自动组织了蚌埠市文艺界慰问队上堤对防汛干部、民工和战士进行慰问演出。
    参加慰问演出的有学习新词的全部民间曲艺艺人及蚌埠市人民京剧团、淮声梆剧团、泗洲戏淮光剧团及到蚌埠市流动演出的河南省商邱专区戏剧改革实验工作团的部分演员。
    在慰问演出活动中，艺人王素梅、史秀兰、泗洲戏演员黄维霞等都把自己要喂奶的孩子留在家里，请人看管，自己坚持上堤。民间艺人和业余文艺活动分子组织了三个小组，不分日夜冒雨上堤。慰问活动给堤上的民工、战士很大鼓舞。慰问队的红旗每次在工地出现，都受到热烈鼓掌欢迎，民工们说：“慰问队来了，大家起劲干活！”战士们高呼口号：“感谢人民的慰问，决心确保蚌埠淮堤安全！”
