Credit cooperatives in Chang'an, Longxian, Jingyang, Fengxian, and other areas of Shaanxi Province are actively developing deposit absorption services to support the summer grain procurement work.

Before and after the start of the summer grain purchase, credit cooperatives in Jingyang, Weinan, Fengxian, Mianxian, Yongshou, Hancheng, Chaoyi, and other areas formulated deposit absorption plans. The seventeen credit cooperatives and sixty-two credit mutual aid groups in Jingyang County plan to absorb over 2.4 billion yuan in deposits in August. The credit cooperatives and credit mutual aid groups in the Xiaqiu District of Weinan County have initially planned to absorb more than 350 million yuan in deposits. In areas where the grain purchase work started earlier, credit cooperatives have already absorbed large amounts of deposits. The Huangliang Village Credit Cooperative in the 14th District of Chang'an County absorbed more than 32 million yuan in deposits in just over ten days in July, accounting for 56.2 percent of the total grain sales revenue of farmers in the village.

    陕西省长安等地信用合作组织
    配合购粮积极吸收存款
    陕西省长安、陇县、泾阳、凤县等地的信用合作组织，配合夏季粮食收购工作，积极开展吸收存款的业务。
    在夏季粮食收购工作开始前后，泾阳、渭南、凤县、沔县、永寿、韩城、朝邑等地的信用合作组织，都分别订出了吸收存款的计划。泾阳县的十七个信用合作社和六十二个信用互助组，八月份计划吸收存款二十四亿余元；渭南县下邽区的信用合作社和信用互助组，初步计划吸收三亿五千余万元存款。购粮工作开始较早的地区，信用合作组织已经吸收到大批存款。长安县第十四区黄良村信用合作社在七月间的十多天内，就吸收存款三千二百多万元，占该村农民售粮款总数的百分之五十六点二。
