    Instruction from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on Rescuing Livestock in Flood-stricken Areas
    (August 15, 1954)
    Currently, farmers in flood-stricken areas are encountering extreme difficulties in raising livestock. Party and government leading organs in some disaster areas are mobilizing the masses to make efforts to rescue livestock, and are planning to transfer draught cattle and fattening pigs to non-disaster areas for fosterage. Some counties have convened symposiums of representatives from districts and townships in severely affected areas to discuss the rescue of livestock, mobilizing the masses to strive for rescue, thereby reducing livestock losses in disaster areas. People's governments at all levels in disaster areas should universally educate the masses, and in conjunction with flood prevention, autumn protection, drainage, and replanting work, protect draught animals and fattening pigs, especially breeding boars and sows, in order to preserve vitality and facilitate the restoration of production. Based on the experience of some areas in Hubei and Anhui, the following measures are generally adopted, and are hereby compiled for reference by all localities:
    (1) In areas along the Yangtze River and lakeside areas where the disaster situation is particularly severe, villages and townships should be taken as units, and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams should lead farmers to transfer livestock in an organized manner to nearby non-disaster areas, and disperse them for fosterage or collective grazing according to specific circumstances. Non-disaster areas should mobilize state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams to lead the broad masses of farmers, promote the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual aid, support disaster areas, take responsibility for sharing fosterage or allocating grazing land, and help both sides to properly formulate methods for mutual assistance, fosterage, and reasonable remuneration. Broadly mobilize the masses to collect as much straw, wild grass, aquatic plants, leaves, and usable hay as possible to increase the source of feed in non-disaster areas.
    (2) In lightly affected areas and areas where waterlogging has begun to recede, in addition to relying on cooperatives and teams to take the lead in demonstrating and solving the current difficulty of insufficient feed, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to produce and save themselves, use draught animals to engage in sideline occupations, and organize animal power to exchange labor for grass to raise livestock with livestock. Seize the season to cut and dry hay. Plant more crops with high yields that can be eaten by both humans and animals, such as sweet potatoes, beans, buckwheat, radishes, taro, and vegetables. After the autumn harvest, a broad call should be made to do a good job in collecting and storing various straws and agricultural and sideline products, and appropriately use idle land to plant green manure crops to increase the source of feed for this winter and next spring. At the same time, according to local grass and feed conditions, processing methods such as washing, chopping short, soaking soft, grinding, and fermentation should be promoted to improve the utilization value of feed and prevent livestock from contracting diseases after eating moldy grass. When replanting crops, the masses must still be educated to use draught animals rationally and prevent livestock from overwork.
    (3) Local provincial and county banks, in conjunction with supply and marketing cooperatives, should provide low-interest loans to farmers in disaster areas. The use of loans should not be specified too mechanically, and appropriate loans can be granted for anything related to rescuing, protecting, transferring, and adjusting livestock. The loan period can be appropriately extended, and interest should be reduced. Provincial and county banks should give priority to lending within their own controlled and allocable amounts. If there is a shortage, they should consult with higher-level banks for allocation. If it is still insufficient, they can ask the head office to solve it. In order to assist the supply and marketing cooperative departments in carrying out the purchase and adjustment of livestock in disaster areas, cattle and pigs that meet the local slaughtering methods for draught cattle and the purchase specifications for fattening pigs can be sold to food companies for slaughter and processing. Healthy livestock, breeding boars and sows, and piglets should be adjusted to non-disaster areas for breeding as much as possible, so as to facilitate adjustment when production is restored in disaster areas. In addition, market management and slaughter inspection of livestock should be strengthened in coordination with relevant departments to strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking the opportunity to suppress prices and purchase cheaply, and to prevent the indiscriminate slaughter of draught cattle.
    (4) Livestock in disaster areas are extremely prone to disease. The masses should be mobilized to strengthen feeding management and prepare medicines, closely monitor the epidemic situation, and prevent and control it in a timely manner. Biological drugs should be supplied to disaster areas as soon as possible. If the epidemic prevention funds are insufficient, they can be paid from the disaster relief funds. Among the various epidemics, special attention should be paid to diseases such as anthrax, emphysema, hemorrhagic septicemia, swine erysipelas, swine fever, and hoof inflammation. At the same time, local agricultural technology extension stations or animal husbandry and veterinary stations should organize and mobilize local veterinarians and livestock protection activists to give full play to their role and do a good job in epidemic prevention in disaster areas.

    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会
    关于抢救水灾地区牲畜的指示
    （一九五四年八月十五日）
    目前水灾地区农民饲养牲畜，遭遇极大困难，若干灾区党政领导机关正发动群众努力抢护牲畜，将耕牛、毛猪有计划地转移到非灾区寄养，部分县召开了重灾区区、乡代表讨论抢救牲畜的座谈会，发动群众努力抢救，因而减少了灾区牲畜的损失。灾区各级人民政府应普遍教育群众，结合防汛、保秋、排水、补种等工作，抢护耕畜、毛猪，特别是种公畜和母畜，以保存元气，有利于恢复生产，据湖北、安徽部分地区经验，大致采取如下办法，特综合给各地参考：
    （一）沿江、滨湖灾情特别严重地区，以村、乡为单位，由农业生产合作社、互助组领导农民有组织地转移牲畜到附近非灾区，按具体情况分散寄养或集体放牧。非灾区动员国营农场、农业生产合作社、互助组，带动广大农民，发扬互助互济精神，支援灾区，负责分担寄养或拨借牧地，帮助双方妥订互助寄养与合理报酬办法。广泛发动群众尽可能搜集一切可能作为饲料的藁杆、野草、水草、树叶及可利用的禾草等，以增加非灾区的饲料来源。
    （二）在轻灾区和积水开始退出的地区，除依靠社、组带头示范，解决目前饲料不足的困难外，还须发动群众生产自救，利用役畜搞副业，组织畜力换工换草，以畜养畜。抓紧季节，刈割、晒制干草。多种一些产量多，人畜均可食用的作物如薯类、豆类、荞麦、萝卜、芋头、菜类等。在秋收后，应广泛号召做好各种秸秆及农作物、副产品收集存贮工作，并适当利用休闲地种植绿肥作物，增加今冬明春饲料来源。同时应根据当地草料情况，提倡洗净、铡短、泡软、磨碎、醱酵等加工方法，以提高饲料利用价值，防止牲畜食霉草后发生疫病。在抢种作物时仍须教育群众合理使用役畜，防止牲口过劳。
    （三）各地省、县银行，结合供销合作社以低利贷款贷给灾区农民，贷款的用途不要规定得太机械，凡和抢救保护转移调剂牲畜有关系的均可适当贷放。贷款期限可适当延长，利息应予减低。省、县银行应尽先就自己控制的和可以调拨的数额内即行贷放，如有不足，商请上级银行拨给，若再不足可请总行解决。为协助供销合作部门进行灾区牲畜的收购调剂工作，凡合于当地屠宰耕牛办法及毛猪收购规格的牛、猪，可售给食品公司屠宰加工。凡健壮牲畜及公、母种畜与小猪应尽量调剂到非灾区饲养，便于灾区恢复生产时调剂。此外宜配合有关部门加强牲畜市场管理及屠宰检查工作，严防奸商乘机压价套购，滥宰耕畜。
    （四）灾区牲畜极易发生疫病；应发动群众加强饲养管理并做好药物准备，密切注视疫情，及时防治。生物药品应尽先供应灾区。防疫经费不足，可在救灾款内支付。各种疫病中应特别注意炭疽、气肿疽、出血性败血病、猪丹毒、猪肺疫和蹄炎等病。同时各地农业技术推广站或畜牧兽医站，应组织和动员地方兽医和保畜积极分子，充分发挥他们的作用，搞好灾区防疫工作。
