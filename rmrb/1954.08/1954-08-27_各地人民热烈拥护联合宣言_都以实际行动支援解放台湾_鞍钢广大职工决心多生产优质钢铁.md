People Across the Country Warmly Support the Joint Declaration
    All Support the Liberation of Taiwan with Practical Actions
    Anshan Iron and Steel's Broad Masses of Workers are Determined to Produce More High-Quality Steel

    The broad masses of workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company have all expressed their determination to produce more high-quality steel and iron, complete basic construction plans, and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan. After seeing the Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan, workers at the steelmaking plant encouraged each other during shift changes: ensuring quality, we must work harder to increase steel production to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. On August 23rd, the first day after the Joint Declaration was announced, the steelmaking plant saw five heats of rapid steelmaking, with the plant's total daily steel output exceeding the plan by 7.8 percent. On the same day, workers at the ironmaking plant also achieved an outstanding performance, exceeding the daily production plan by 7.82 percent. On this day, the automated No. 7 blast furnace produced more than 120 tons of pig iron for the state, setting the highest production record since August.

    Li Feng'en, Anshan's special-grade labor model and deputy chief technician of furnace front at the ironmaking plant, said, "Liberating Taiwan is the common will of all Chinese people and the fervent desire of peace-loving people in Asia and the world." He said that he will strengthen the unity of furnace front workers in each ironmaking furnace, implement the suggestions made by Soviet experts to eliminate residual iron in front of the furnace, produce more pig iron, and increase the strength to liberate Taiwan. Workers in the rolling mill section of the large rolling mill held a discussion on the issue of liberating Taiwan in front of the huge rolling mill. Youth foreman Li Yuanhui said that liberating Taiwan is the sacred task of the people of the whole country. We will resolutely guarantee the completion of the production task of large steel materials, and quickly complete the trial rolling task of new products to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

    The workers who are working hard on the construction of China's third automated blast furnace have become even more enthusiastic after seeing the Joint Declaration. Su Menglan, an old worker in the gas scrubbing section, proposed to ensure the proper testing of pipelines to create conditions for the blast furnace to be ignited and heated as soon as possible. The famous labor model Huang Demao has previously created several steel bar processing and forming machines, which greatly improved labor efficiency. After seeing the Joint Declaration, he was determined to realize four rationalization proposals, including the production of a universal steel bar forming machine and an automatic steel bar straightening machine, as soon as possible. He said, "Now my determination to make steel bar processing and forming completely automated and mechanized is even greater, and my confidence is even stronger."

    The Seamen Working on the Sichuan River Want to Go to the Forefront to Undertake Glorious Tasks
    The seamen working on the Sichuan River were very excited after seeing the Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan. The joint state-private Sichuan River Steamship Company was holding a workers' representative conference at the time, and all the workers' representatives unanimously expressed their warm support for the Joint Declaration and guaranteed to resolutely overcome floods and dangerous shoals, complete the transportation tasks for the second half of the year, and support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions. The seamen on barge No. 113 of the Chongqing Port Authority held a discussion immediately after reading the newspaper carrying the Joint Declaration. Zhou Dafa, a Class A labor model at Chongqing Port, said that he is always preparing, and as long as the motherland needs him, he is willing to contribute his strength to the liberation of Taiwan. After reading the Joint Declaration, seaman Zhao Donglin went to the Seamen's Union and expressed his desire to go to the most forward areas of the struggle to undertake the glorious task of liberating Taiwan.

    A Unit of the People's Liberation Army Participating in Industrial Construction Wants to Accelerate the Construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant
    All members of a unit of the People's Liberation Army participating in the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant said that they would respond to the call of the declaration by increasing production and practicing economy and accelerating the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant after seeing the joint declaration of the democratic parties and people's organizations for the liberation of Taiwan. Zhang Xingli, deputy company commander of the carpentry company participating in the construction of the motorcycle workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, said: "I have been following the troops in battles from south to north since I joined the army in 1939 in order to complete the cause of liberating the whole country. After the mainland of the country was liberated, our unit participated in the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and I will definitely contribute to the liberation of Taiwan in the construction post." Liu Mingru, deputy squad leader and cement worker participating in the construction of the forging workshop, said: "We must respond to the call of the joint declaration, carry forward the fine traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy and labor emulation, and strive to build the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant successfully as soon as possible." Liu Mingru's company was awarded a flag by the superior leadership organs last year for completing the construction task well, with the words "You are models for overfulfilling the task on the basis of ensuring quality" written on the flag. This year, in the construction, the soldiers of this company are full of confidence to save 2 billion yuan for the country. Soldier Dong Fenghe, who works on the construction site of the casting workshop, fought with his comrades in Shandong and other places during the past Liberation War and made contributions to the people. He has also made first-class merit in participating in the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. He said, "In order to liberate Taiwan, I will definitely make more contributions to the people." Li Mingliang, a soldier who is building the forging workshop, and many other soldiers said: Now that the motherland needs us to participate in the construction, we will go all out; if the liberation of Taiwan needs us, we will take up our weapons and go to the front again.

    Construction Workers in Shenyang City Install Metal Frames in the Rain
    After seeing the joint declaration, workers on various construction sites in Shenyang City greatly improved their enthusiasm for work. Li Mingsheng's crane team on the electric wire factory construction site used to install four metal frames every day. After hearing the broadcast of the joint declaration, they decided to support the declaration with practical actions. On the same day, everyone installed five metal frames in the rain. Jia Fengjiang, a bricklayer in the 219 construction site, said: "We cannot directly participate in the battle to liberate Taiwan, so we must do well, save, be fast, and be safe in the basic construction posts." He said that he would complete three days' work in two and a half days.

    On the morning of August 23, the loudspeaker in each workshop of Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 7 repeatedly broadcast the joint declaration. Zhang Zhiyuan, an old worker in the fourth workshop, expressed his firm support and guaranteed to transform the manually operated bicycle tire forming machine in the third workshop into a mechanized one before October 1. Xu Liangui, a municipal labor model of Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, said that he would definitely work with the workers to overcome difficulties, solve key problems in production, and manufacture more and better rock drills to support the liberation of Taiwan.

    Taiwanese Compatriots Residing in Fuzhou and Xiamen are Willing to Contribute Everything to the Liberation of Taiwan
    After the publication of the joint declaration of the democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China for the liberation of Taiwan, the Taiwanese compatriots residing in Fuzhou and Xiamen felt extremely excited. They believed that the declaration expressed the wishes of the eight million people of Taiwan for many years; in order to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland, the Taiwanese compatriots must strengthen unity and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army.

    Wang Tianqiang, a central director of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League residing in Fuzhou, said at a gathering: Although Taiwan has been ruled by Japanese imperialism for half a century, it cannot eliminate the Taiwanese people's love for the motherland, and we have carried out struggles one after another. Now, the Chiang Kai-shek traitor wants to sell Taiwan to the United States. The Taiwanese people do not want to be slaves of Japan, nor will they be slaves of the United States. He also said: After Chiang Kai-shek's traitor usurped Taiwan, he has turned Taiwan into a dark hell, and the people are in desperate situation. Only by eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can the Taiwanese people live a free and happy life. Li Yiren, a worker who had just arrived in Fuzhou from Taiwan, said: "I personally saw in Taiwan that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique killed people everywhere, raped women, arrested men for labor, burned, killed and looted, and did all kinds of evil. The Taiwanese people will always remember this hatred. The Taiwanese people must unite strongly, make all preparations, and welcome the People's Liberation Army." Zhang Haoran, who participated in the "February 28th" movement, also angrily accused Chiang Kai-shek of his crimes in Taiwan. He said that he must participate in the great struggle to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and liberate his hometown.

    Taiwanese compatriots residing in Xiamen also held a symposium on the 24th to accuse Chiang Kai-shek of his crimes and support the joint declaration on the liberation of Taiwan. At the meeting, they missed their beautiful and rich hometown and expressed their gratitude for the concern and sympathy expressed by the people of the motherland to the Taiwan compatriots in the joint declaration, and unanimously expressed their willingness to do all kinds of work with the people of the whole country and contribute everything to the liberation of Taiwan.

    The Broad Masses of Peasants in the Suburbs of Xi'an Must Work Hard to Cultivate and Strive for a Good Harvest
    The peasants in the suburbs of Xi'an unanimously believed that every word in the declaration expressed their wishes. Zou Yi, a peasant in Beiyuzhai Village who is actively preparing to establish an agricultural production cooperative, said: "We must liberate Taiwan, remove the scourge of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and defend the socialist construction of the country and our happy life." Deng Tieshan, deputy director of the Dengjia Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, which has had good harvests every year, said: "Our cooperative is preparing to plant 60 mu of wheat this year. We must work hard to cultivate and strive for a good harvest to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan."
