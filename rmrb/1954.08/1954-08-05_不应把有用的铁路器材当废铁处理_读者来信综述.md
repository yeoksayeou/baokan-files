	Useful Railway Materials Should Not Be Treated as Scrap Iron
	--A Summary of Letters from Readers
	Readers Qian Yi and Zhou Bingdan from the Jinan Railway Administration reflect: At the end of last year, the Jinan Branch of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company purchased 380 tons of scrap steel rails from the Dalian Trust Company, which had bought them from the Dalian Shipyard, and sold them to various places as raw materials for manufacturing agricultural implements. However, many of these steel rails had very little wear, and some even met the standard length. After the Materials Section of the Engineering Department of the Jinan Railway Administration discovered this, they inspected the unsold rails and found that 361 out of more than 400 rails could be repaired and used. They have already agreed with the company to exchange the scrap rails for usable ones. At the beginning of this year, the company purchased more than 1,000 tons of scrap from the Fushun Mining Bureau, which also contained a large number of valuable railway materials. After the Jinan Engineering Section of the Jinan Railway Administration sent someone to sort and organize the materials, they exchanged them for more than 100 tons of useful rails and other materials. Among them were some 40-kilogram B-type five-meter frog rails. If sold as scrap, each rail would only be worth 800,000 yuan, but it would cost the railway department more than 2 million yuan to buy one such material, and it is urgently needed and difficult to find on the current lines. The readers pointed out that if this situation is not discovered and corrected, the country will suffer unnecessary losses. This situation of treating useful railway materials as scrap is not isolated. For example, in February of this year, the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Agency consigned 56 tons of brand-new Soviet-imported iron tie plates at Tianjin East Station, ready to be sent to Xingtai for processing and manufacturing agricultural implements. After the Tianjin Railway Bureau discovered this, it purchased them at the original purchase price plus transportation and miscellaneous fees and immediately sent them to the construction site for use. It was learned that this was purchased by the North China Cooperative General Agency from a warehouse of the Second Engineering Bureau Materials Supply Department of the Second Ministry of Machine Building as stagnant materials and then allocated to the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Agency. Even some railway departments have improper handling of materials. For example, the Jiang'an Material Factory under the Zhengzhou Railway Administration sold more than 13 tons of triangular steel, a material required for large buildings, to the Wuchang County Cooperative General Agency in Hubei for cutting and use, resulting in the waste of valuable materials in national construction by using large materials for small purposes.
	In the early days of Liberation, with the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people, the railway department collected a large number of railway materials, which played a significant role in the restoration of railway transportation. At present, although the number of railway materials scattered in various places is no longer large, and the country is already able to manufacture steel rails, fully utilizing old materials is still a matter worthy of attention. This is not only because the general task of the country's transition period requires all materials to play their due role in the construction cause; but also because with the development of economic construction, the maintenance tasks of the original lines are extremely heavy. The steel rail types on these lines are quite complex, and various miscellaneous rails cannot be completely replaced for a while, and some have no source, so old materials can only be used to solve the maintenance problem. Many railway departments have made a lot of efforts in this regard and have also achieved some results. For example, the Jilin Railway Administration organized a steel rail collection team in July last year to collect materials on the Xingning Line, which was destroyed in the past war. With the support of the local Party and government leading organs and the assistance of farmers along the line, by March of this year, a total of 8,700 steel rails, more than 240 tons of accessories, two vertical boilers, and other large quantities of materials, with a total value of more than 17 billion yuan, were collected. For example, the steel rails used by the Changchun Branch Basic Construction Team of the Harbin Railway Administration for the construction of coal storage lines and turntable projects last year were dismantled from the bunkers left on the mountains. This year, they collected more than 4,000 steel rails and more than 7,000 fishplates on an abandoned line between Changchun and Baichengzi, worth about 10 billion yuan, which not only guaranteed the materials needed for the Changchun Branch's increase in sidings and dedicated lines this year, but also transferred a part to support fraternal railway bureaus.
	To do this work well, it is not enough to rely on the efforts of the railway department alone. At present, many industrial and mining enterprises are actively handling stagnant and waste materials, and local hardware and machinery companies and cooperatives are purchasing a large amount of scrap iron to supply raw materials for manufacturing agricultural implements. These tasks are all necessary. However, it is hoped that when dealing with scrap steel rails and other railway materials, they should carefully carry out identification work and contact nearby railway departments as much as possible to avoid useful railway materials being treated as scrap. Railway departments in various places should also take the initiative to strengthen contacts with relevant units to ensure that the collection of railway materials is further improved.

### 不应把有用的铁路器材当废铁处理——读者来信综述

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不应把有用的铁路器材当废铁处理
    ——读者来信综述
    济南铁路管理局读者钱彝、周秉旦反映：中国五金机械公司济南支公司去年年底通过大连信托公司向大连造船厂买了三百八十吨废钢轨，卖给各地作制造农具的原料。但是，这些钢轨中有不少磨耗程度很轻，有的甚至还合乎标准长度。济南铁路管理局工务处材料科发现后，验看了尚未售出的钢轨，四百余条中有三百六十一条是修配后可用的，他们已和该公司协议用废轨换走。该公司今年年初向抚顺矿务局买来的一千多吨废料中，又有大批贵重铁路器材。经济南铁路管理局济南工务段派专人挑选整理，换走了有用的道轨及其它器材共一百多吨。其中有一部分是四十公斤B型五公尺的尖轨，如果按废料出售每根只值八十余万元，但是铁路部门买一根这样的材料就需要二百多万元，并且还是目前线路上迫切需要而很难搜购到的。读者指出，这种情况如不被发现和纠正，就会使国家受到不应有的损失。这种把有用的铁路器材当废料处理的情况并不是个别的。例如，今年二月河北省合作总社曾在天津东站托运全新的苏联进口铁垫板五十六吨，准备送到邢台加工制作农具。天津铁路局发现后已按原购价加运杂费收购，并立即送工地使用。经了解，原来这是华北合作总社向第二机械工业部第二工程局材料供应处某库当呆滞材料买来后拨给河北省合作总社的。甚至某些铁路部门也有处理器材不当的情况。如郑州铁路管理局所属江岸材料厂曾把大型建筑物所需的材料三角钢十三吨多卖给湖北武昌县合作总社切断使用，使国家建设中的贵重物资大材小用，受到浪费。
    解放初期，在广大人民的热烈支持下，铁路部门搜集了大量的铁路器材，对铁路交通的恢复工作起了很大的作用。目前，虽然散失各地的铁路器材已经为数无多，国内也已经能够制造钢轨，但是充分地利用旧器材还是一个值得注意的问题。这不仅因为国家过渡时期的总任务要求一切物资在建设事业中发挥应有的作用；而且还因为随着经济建设事业的开展，原有线路的维修任务极其繁重，这些线路上的钢轨类型相当复杂，各种杂型轨一时不能全部换掉，有的已经没有来源，只能利用旧器材来解决维修问题。不少铁路部门在这方面作了不少努力，也得到了一些效果。例如，吉林铁路管理局去年七月组织了钢轨搜集队，在过去战争中被破坏了的兴宁线上进行器材搜集工作。在当地党政领导机关的支持和沿线农民的协助下，到今年三月为止共搜集了钢轨八千七百根，配件二百四十余吨，立式锅炉两台以及其它大批器材，总值一百七十余亿元。又如哈尔滨铁路管理局长春分局基本建设队去年铺设贮煤线和转车台工程所用的钢轨，就是从山上遗留的碉堡上拆下来的。今年他们又在长春到白城子间的一条废线上搜集了四千多根钢轨，七千多块鱼尾板，价值约一百余亿元，不但保证了长春分局管内今年增添侧线和专用线需要的器材，而且还调出一部分支援了兄弟路局。
    要做好这个工作，单靠铁路部门的努力还是不够的。目前很多工矿单位正在积极处理呆废材料，各地五金机械公司和合作社正在大量搜购废铁料以供应制造农具的原料，这些工作都是很必要的。但是，希望他们在处理废旧钢轨和其它铁路器材时，应该认真进行鉴别工作，并且尽可能与附近铁路部门联系，以免有用的铁路器材也被当成了废料。各地铁路部门也应该主动地和有关单位加强联系，以保证进一步做好铁路器材的搜集工作。
