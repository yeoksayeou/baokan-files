    "Shortcut"
    Xiaoyuan
    The First Ceramics Factory of the Architectural Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry frequently failed to complete the state production plan for sanitary ceramics in 1953. The main reason was the poor quality of the products and the excessive number of defective products. However, the conclusion of the factory's administrative leaders after inspecting the products was not that the product quality was too low, but that the "quality inspection standards were too high." Thus, they found a "shortcut" – "lowering the inspection standards" to make it "conform to the actual requirements of product quality."
    The first step was to "strengthen ideological education" for the inspectors. Factory Director Liu Jingyang (now transferred) said, "Things for shitting and pissing, as long as they can be used and sold, that's good enough. Don't throw them all away." Deputy Factory Director Wang Guishan even personally picked out "qualified products" from the defective product pile to "get through" to the inspectors with practical examples. For inspector Liu Chengzui, who still could not "implement the leadership's intentions" even after repeated "education," Production Section Chief Ba Shiyi suggested that Quality Inspection Section Chief Li Hentong instruct him to "make a self-criticism" in the workshop as a form of punishment.
    Next, under the "instruction" of Factory Director Liu Jingyang, new "quality inspection standards" were established. The original quality inspection standards approved by the state stipulated that the length of cracks in first-class products should not exceed half a centimeter in the external glazed area and should not exceed one and a half centimeters in the concealed surface. The "new standard" changed this to no more than one centimeter in two places on the outside and no more than two centimeters in four places on the concealed surface; the original standard stipulated that the cracks in second-class products should not exceed one centimeter on the outside and two centimeters and four places on the concealed surface. The "new standard" changed this to no more than three centimeters in three places on the outside, and the concealed part did not matter in length as long as it did not leak. This standard was sent to the Architectural Materials Industry Administration Bureau, and the bureau replied on May 23, 1953, disagreeing; however, the factory still implemented it with "independent responsibility."
    After the implementation of the "new quality inspection standards," it still could not fully meet the requirements of product quality. Thus, the factory's leaders proposed the principle of "flexible application of standards." Since it was stipulated that first-class products could have two cracks of one centimeter long on the surface, wouldn't one crack of two centimeters be the same? If there was one crack of eight centimeters on the concealed surface, that would be no different from two centimeters in four places, still meeting the conditions for first-class products. This kind of "flexibility" was still insufficient, and finally, they simply proposed that "whatever can be sold is a qualified product"; or, to put it more thoroughly, as Quality Inspection Section Chief Li Hentong said in response to a comrade's criticism of the inspection work, the standard of qualification was—"what we consider qualified."
    Sure enough, this "shortcut" was very effective! After such work, the quality of sanitary ceramics "in the factory" quickly "improved": "First-class products" became more and more numerous, and "defective products" were greatly reduced. Unfortunately, however, these products were very unpopular with users, and many products that had already been sold were deemed substandard and returned by the truckload, with even larger quantities simply piling up in warehouses. After re-inspecting these "inspected and certified qualified" products in stock, it was found that more than 1,100 pieces of second-class products and 552 pieces of defective products could be picked out from the first-class products, and 4,475 pieces of defective products could be picked out from the second-class products. This resulted in a loss of 720 million yuan of state property and a backlog of 4.63 billion yuan of funds, not to mention the adverse political impact.
    When the Architectural Materials Industry Administration Bureau and the Beiguan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Shenyang Municipality investigated this issue, these "leaders who were good at finding shortcuts" still concealed the facts, stubbornly argued, and tried to evade responsibility. After reinvestigation and repeated education, they had no choice but to admit their mistakes under the weight of irrefutable facts, but their understanding was still not profound. The Architectural Materials Industry Administration Bureau has now submitted its proposed handling opinions to the Ministry of Heavy Industry for approval, giving these leaders the punishment they deserve.
    This incident has been dealt with. However, this kind of erroneous thinking is not isolated among our enterprise leaders. For example, the Beijing Knitted and Printed Fabric Factory's dyed fabrics were of poor quality, and the vast number of consumers or sales departments had many complaints; however, Geng Xiao, the factory director, was still complacent about the quality of the products. Once, the factory's inspectors inspected over 2,000 bolts of national defense blue fabric and found over 1,300 bolts of second-class products. At that time, Wu Zhijiang, the engineer in charge of quality decision-making, believed that the inspection was too strict, and Factory Director Geng Xiao agreed with this view. Thus, the fabrics that the inspectors considered second-class were mostly rated as first-class by the engineer. However, when the cotton yarn and fabric company inspected them, they still failed to pass and were downgraded. Although this problem was not as serious as that of the First Ceramics Factory, the result was the same—product quality could not be improved in a timely manner, causing undue losses to the state.
    Improving product quality and making product quality meet the requirements of the state and the people is an important task that enterprise leaders must strive to achieve at present. If someone attempts to use the method of lowering inspection standards to accommodate the poor quality of products, the result will only be to create a breeding ground for the survival and growth of shortcomings in production management, and to place a stumbling block on the road to improving their own work, which is not beneficial to the interests of the state and the people, nor to the work of their own enterprises. It is hoped that this "shortcut" of self-deception to improve product quality will quickly disappear in our enterprises.

    “窍门”
    晓园
    中央人民政府重工业部建筑材料工业管理局第一陶瓷厂，一九五三年生产卫生陶瓷器经常不能完成国家生产计划，原因主要是产品质量低劣，废品太多。可是，厂的行政领导干部检查产品以后的结论，却不是产品质量太低，而是“质量检查标准太高”。于是，他们找到了一个“窍门”——“降低检查标准”，使它“符合于产品质量实际情况的要求”。
    第一步工作是对检查员“加强思想教育”。厂长刘景阳（现已调职）就说：“拉屎撒尿的东西，只要能用、能卖钱就行，不要都给我们扔了。”副厂长王桂山还亲自动手，从废品堆里挑出了“合格品”，用实际事例来“打通”检查员的思想。对于经过反复“教育”以后仍旧不能“贯彻领导意图”的检查员刘成税，也在生产科长巴士毅建议下，由质量检查科长李恨冬责成他在车间里“检讨认错”，以示惩戒。
    接着，在厂长刘景阳的“指示”下，订出了新的“质量检查标准”。原来国家批准的质量检查标准规定：一等品的裂纹长度在外部施釉处不得超过半公分、在隐蔽面不得超过一公分半，
  “新标准”改为在外部不超过一公分两处、隐蔽面不超过二公分四处；原标准规定二等品的裂纹外部不超过一公分、隐蔽面不超过二公分四处，
  “新标准”改为外部不超过三公分三处、隐蔽部不管长度只要不漏水就行。这个标准送到建筑材料工业管理局，局里在一九五三年五月二十三日批复不同意；但是厂里依然“独立负责”地实施了。
    “新的质量检查标准”施行以后还是不能完全符合产品质量的要求。于是，厂里的领导干部们又提出了“标准应该灵活运用”的原则。既然规定一等品表面可以有一公分长的裂纹两处，那末有一处两公分的裂纹岂非一样；隐蔽面有了一处八公分的裂纹，那也和两公分四处无异，依然合乎一等品的条件。这样“灵活”尚有不足之处，最后索性提出“能卖钱的就是合格品”；或者再说得彻底一些，像质量检查科长李恨冬在答复一位同志对检查工作的批评时所说的，合格的标准就是——“我们认为合格”。
    果然，这个“窍门”有效得很！经过这样一番工作，卫生陶瓷器的质量“在厂里”很快地“提高”了：“一等品”愈来愈多，“废品”大大减少。但是不幸，这些产品很不受使用者欢迎，许多已经出售的产品竟被认为不合标准而一车一车地退回来，更大量的只能积压在仓库里。经对这些库存的“经过检查证明合格”的产品复查的结果，一等品中竟挑出二等品一千一百多件、废品五百五十二件，二等品中竟挑出废品四千四百七十五件。这就使国家财产损失七亿二千多万元，资金积压四十六亿三千多万元，至于政治上的恶劣影响就不待说了。
    当建筑材料工业管理局和中共沈阳市北关区委员会对这个问题进行检查时，这些“善找窍门”的领导干部们还是隐瞒事实，强辩抵赖，企图逃避责任。经过复查和反复教育，在确凿的事实证明之下，他们才不得不承认了错误，但是认识依旧是不深刻的。现在建筑材料工业管理局已经提出处理意见送请重工业部批准，给这些领导干部以应得的处分。
    这个事件是处理了。但是，这种错误思想在我们企业领导干部中间并不是个别的。例如，北京机织印染厂染制的色布质量不好，广大消费者或销售部门都有不少意见；但是该厂厂长耿晓对产品质量的情况还感到自满。有一次厂里的检验员在两千匹国防蓝布中竟检查出一千三百多匹二等品。当时掌握质量决定权的工程师吴之江认为检查得太严了，厂长耿晓也同意这个意见。于是，检查员认为是二等品的布匹在工程师手里大部被评为一级品。但是当花纱布公司验收时还是通不过，降了下来。虽然这个问题没有第一陶瓷厂那么严重，但是结果却是一样——产品质量不能及时改进，使国家遭受了不应有的损失。
    提高产品质量，使产品质量符合国家和人民的要求，这是目前企业领导干部必须努力实现的重要任务。如果有人企图用降低检查标准的办法来迁就产品质量低劣的情况，其结果只能使生产管理中的缺点得到生存和滋长的温床，在自己改进工作的道路上安下一块绊脚石，对国家和人民的利益，对本企业的工作都没有好处。希望这种自欺欺人的提高产品质量的“窍门”在我们的企业中赶快绝迹。
