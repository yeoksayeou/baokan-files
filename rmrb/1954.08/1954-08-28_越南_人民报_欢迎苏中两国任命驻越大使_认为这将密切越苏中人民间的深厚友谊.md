    Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, August 26th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an article on the 25th, warmly welcoming the decision of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to send plenipotentiary ambassadors to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The article stated: On August 12th, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided to appoint Alexander Lavrishchev as the plenipotentiary ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; on August 11th, the Government of the People's Republic of China decided to appoint Luo Guibo as the plenipotentiary ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At a time when the Vietnamese people are joyfully celebrating the restoration of peace in Indochina, this news has made the Vietnamese people even more excited.
    The article stated: The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are the pillars of the world's peace and democracy forces. They have consistently sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. The valuable experience of the Soviet and Chinese people is a torch illuminating the path of the Vietnamese nation's progress. In January 1950, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China were the first to establish diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Subsequently, other people's democratic countries established diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, further strengthening the solid friendship between the Vietnamese people and the people of fraternal countries, and also inspiring the enthusiasm of the Vietnamese people in their struggle for the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of their motherland.
    The article, after recounting the strong support and assistance provided by the Soviet Union and China to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the struggle for peace, especially at the Geneva Conference, pointed out that the two ambassadors from the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are the first ambassadors the Vietnamese people have had the honor of welcoming since the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese people are deeply convinced that the decision of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to send plenipotentiary ambassadors to Vietnam is of great significance for strengthening the profound friendship between the Vietnamese, Soviet, and Chinese peoples for generations to come and for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

    越南“人民报”欢迎苏中两国任命驻越大使
    认为这将密切越苏中人民间的深厚友谊
     【新华社北越二十六日电】越南“人民报”二十五日发表文章，热烈欢迎苏联和中华人民共和国政府派遣驻越南民主共和国特命全权大使的决定。
    文章说：八月十二日，苏联最高苏维埃主席团决定任命亚历山大·拉夫里谢夫为驻越南民主共和国特命全权大使；八月十一日，中华人民共和国政府决定任命罗贵波为驻越南民主共和国特命全权大使。正当越南人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝恢复印度支那和平的时候，这一消息使越南人民更加兴奋。
    文章说：苏联和中华人民共和国是世界和平民主力量的支柱，它们一贯同情和支持越南人民的正义斗争。苏联和中国人民宝贵的经验是照耀越南民族前进道路的火炬。一九五零年一月，苏联和中华人民共和国首先和越南民主共和国建立外交关系，接着各人民民主国家相继和越南民主共和国建立外交关系，更加紧密了越南人民和各兄弟国家人民之间的牢固友谊，同时也鼓舞了越南人民为争取祖国的和平、统一、独立、民主的斗争热情。
    文章在叙述了苏联、中国在争取和平的斗争中特别是日内瓦会议上对越南民主共和国的大力支持与帮助后指出，前来越南民主共和国的苏联和中华人民共和国的两位大使是越南人民自越南民主共和国成立以来首次荣幸迎接的大使。越南人民深信苏联和中华人民共和国政府派遣特命全权大使来越南的决定对密切越、苏、中人民之间世世代代的深厚友谊和对于保卫亚洲和世界的和平具有重大意义。
