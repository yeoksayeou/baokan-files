Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council Beijing meeting grandly opened at Huairentang in Beijing on the afternoon of the 9th.

This meeting is the first meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council since it was elected at the Third World Youth Congress in Bucharest in July 1953. The agenda of the meeting is: the issue of youth movements in colonial and dependent countries; the participation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and its member organizations in the International Rural Youth Conference; and preparations for the Fifth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival. This meeting is of great significance to the youth of all countries, and the meeting will make resolutions on how the youth and their organizations of various countries will conduct activities for a considerable period of time.

The opening ceremony was held at 4 p.m. More than 200 youth representatives, observers, and guests from 50 countries who have already arrived in Beijing attended the meeting. These countries are: South Africa, Algeria, Germany, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Ceylon, Chile, China, North Korea, Cuba, Denmark, Ecuador, Spain, the United States, Finland, France, Great Britain, Greece, the Netherlands, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Martinique, Mexico, Mongolia, Niger, Norway, Pakistan, Laos, Poland, Romania, Senegal, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Trinidad, Tunisia, the Soviet Union, Venezuela, and Vietnam. The representatives of the countries attending the meeting have extremely broad representation, representing youth from all walks of life with different social strata, different political views, different religious beliefs, and different social occupations. They came to Beijing, some encountering difficulties in obtaining passports, and some risking unemployment and persecution; however, in order to realize the deep aspirations of hundreds of millions of young people, they finally stubbornly overcame numerous difficulties and attended this meeting.

Representatives from various international organizations such as the World Peace Council were also invited to attend the meeting.

Six members of the Japanese Peace Delegation, including Toshio Kuroda, also participated in the meeting.

The conference venue was solemn and beautiful. The flags of 50 countries were erected on both sides of the entrance of the venue, and a large flag of the World Federation of Democratic Youth was hung on the opposite wall. A huge emblem of the World Federation of Democratic Youth was hung on the velvet curtain on the rostrum. The venue was surrounded by flowers. The lights in the hall reflected the colorful decorations on the columns, which were brilliantly illuminated. The interpreting system installed in the venue can simultaneously transmit the reports and speeches of the representatives to the participants in five languages: Chinese, Russian, French, English, and Spanish.

At 4 o'clock, the meeting began. The President of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Bernini, first delivered the opening speech. After he announced the opening of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council meeting, he invited the presidium of the congress, which was drafted through consultation by the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council, to the rostrum. At this time, warm applause rang out throughout the venue.

Hu Yaobang, the head of the Chinese youth delegation, delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress amidst warm applause. On behalf of 120 million young people in China, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the youth peace envoys from various countries. He said: The World Federation of Democratic Youth is a glorious banner for youth all over the world. We are confident that it will achieve greater success in attracting and inspiring millions of young people to fight for peace, democracy, national independence, and a bright future for youth. Chinese youth will always be loyal to the cause of unity of youth all over the world and will always be the most loyal and reliable friends of youth of all countries. Hu Yaobang finally wished the congress a complete success.

When Hu Yaobang finished his speech, the audience stood up and applauded for three minutes.

At this time, dozens of youth representatives from all walks of life in the capital walked through the venue and ascended the rostrum to present flowers to the presidium of the congress. When the flowers were presented, the audience stood up, and the applause lasted for a long time.

Next, the meeting unanimously, without any dissent or abstention, raised their hands to approve the agenda and schedule of the meeting.

The meeting was then presided over by Liao Chengzhi, the executive chairman.

The venue welcomed with warm applause the report by the President of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Brenno Bernini, on the first item on the agenda.

Bernini said that today millions of young people still live in inhumane conditions enslaved by colonialists. Almost half of the world's population (44 percent) lives in colonial and dependent countries. After the victory of the anti-fascist war, the struggle of the colonial people to liberate their countries from oppression and to make their countries prosper in peaceful labor has become stronger and more invincible year by year, month by month, and day by day. There has never been such a large-scale movement in human history. The people of some entire countries have liberated themselves from the shackles of the colonial system and gained complete independence. The people of other countries have resolutely embarked on this path of national liberation. The foundation of the colonial system has been shaken. The establishment of the People's Republic of China has shocked the entire colonial world, and the great victories of the Korean and Vietnamese people against the aggressors also have important historical significance.

Bernini said that the rapid awakening of the people of colonial and dependent countries and their heroic struggle for the sacred rights of independence and peace are making an increasingly great and immeasurable contribution to the common cause of mankind in striving for world peace and progress. Youth are fighting at the forefront of this powerful movement.

Bernini cited many facts and specific figures to illustrate that colonialism and foreign rule are the root causes of the serious poverty of the people and youth of colonial countries in all aspects. He said that we declare that a truly collective security and peace-keeping policy should be based on the principles of coexistence of different social systems, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, mutual understanding, and resolving all international disputes through political consultation. Recent events have attracted worldwide public opinion. The conclusion of the ceasefire agreement in Indochina and the talks between Mr. Zhou Enlai and Mr. Nehru and the Prime Minister of Burma, all these facts show the possibility of resolving all outstanding international issues through peaceful methods and the possibility of peaceful coexistence between countries regardless of political systems. These events have opened up new prospects for the peaceful resolution of all international issues and the easing of international tensions, for which peace-loving people all over the world express their congratulations.

Bernini said that it is obvious that the era in which colonialists can arbitrarily manipulate the fate of colonial and dependent countries is gone forever. After he described the great victories of the people and youth of China, North Korea, Vietnam and many other countries against colonial rule and for national independence, he pointed out that the people and youth of colonial and dependent countries fully understand that freedom, happiness and the joy of life are only possible in a peaceful environment. Therefore, young people are increasingly and widely participating in all activities and struggles of the world peace movement. The youth of colonial and dependent countries realize that all attempts to undermine peace, in whatever form, seriously threaten their survival. Young people resolutely oppose all military aggression treaties and the arms race, oppose dragging their countries and the people of all countries into military blocs and conventions, and oppose the establishment of military bases on their territories. Young people resolutely demand the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and all weapons of mass destruction.

Bernini emphasized that, in the current situation, the most prominent feature is the universality of the international solidarity of the youth of all countries in the world with the youth of colonial and dependent countries. Such a strong solidarity movement is unprecedented. In the future, fraternal solidarity with the youth of colonial countries will become a part of the life and activities of the democratic youth movements of all countries. Bernini explained that the World Federation of Democratic Youth carries out its activities based on the following principles, namely, love, equality and friendship among young people of all countries, all races, all religious beliefs and political tendencies. Faithful to these principles, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has always held high the banner of fighting for the freedom, national independence and a bright future of the youth of oppressed countries. It expresses its deep solidarity with the youth of these countries in various forms. Bernini pointed out that the member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth should always pay attention to strengthening the struggle activities of the youth of colonial and dependent countries for freedom and national independence. Young people should rise up more resolutely to oppose interference in the internal affairs of these countries in any way. The member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth should link the struggle for freedom and national independence with the struggle for the right to life and the realization of the most urgent demands.

The youth of colonial and dependent countries should rise up with the greatest enthusiasm to oppose all acts of military aggression, all foreign interference in the internal affairs of these countries, dragging these countries into military blocs, the establishment of military bases on the territories of these countries, and the arms race.

In order to realize all these fair and reasonable demands, the member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth should carry out interpretation, education and organization work among the broadest masses of young people in urban and rural areas. The member organizations should pay special attention to inviting new masses of young people to participate in the activities of their organizations, step up their work, and expand their influence in order to consolidate their organizations. Bernini also called on youth organizations of all countries to unite and fight against colonialism and foreign rule and for a better life for youth.

Bernini's report was warmly welcomed.

After a fifteen-minute break, the meeting proceeded with speeches from the floor. Representatives from France, South Africa, Brazil, and Japan spoke in succession. They unanimously supported the report by Brenno Bernini, President of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, on the first item on the agenda.

French representative Leon Claude Rolandzi said that we should tell the rulers of our country that the era of suppressing the colonial people by force is over. From now on, the only way is to resolve all international disputes through peaceful consultation that safeguards the interests of the people of all nations. He cheered for the ceasefire in Indochina and congratulated the people and youth of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos on obtaining a peaceful life for the first time. He expressed that French youth will unite with youth from all over the world, especially youth from colonial countries, to fight for a bright future for youth. When the French representative finished speaking, the youth representatives from Vietnam, Laos, and France attending the meeting walked out of their seats one after another, shaking hands, hugging, and kissing each other. The whole audience repeatedly applauded warmly for the friendship of the youth of these three countries.

South African representative A. Sachs said: South Africa is a country suffering from national oppression and racial discrimination. The people are deprived of the rights to life, education, and election, and the prisons are filled with young people. However, he also pointed out that the South African youth, under such extremely difficult and arduous conditions, still hold high the banner of "peace, friendship, and racial harmony," and unite with all people of color and righteous whites to carry out an unyielding struggle for peace, national independence, and youth rights. He said that the example of some Asian countries that have broken free from and are breaking free from the shackles of colonialism will also be realized in Africa.

In his speech, Brazilian representative Paulo Ribeiro cited many facts of Brazil's increasing colonization politically, economically, culturally, and militarily, illustrating the correctness and timeliness of Bernini's report on the first item on the agenda. The speaker described in detail the various struggles of the Brazilian people against colonial rule and the U.S.-Brazil (West) military agreement, and expressed that Brazilian youth will work together with the people of the whole country to strive to defend national sovereignty.

Japanese youth representative Kenji Yamaguchi said in his speech that Japan has been under foreign occupation for several years. Therefore, peace is the most important issue for Japan. Colonialism and militarism have brought a miserable life to the Japanese people and youth, which makes the Japanese people and youth feel the need for the independence of the motherland even more. He wished the meeting victory and success.

The opening ceremony ended in warm applause. (Attached picture)

    应邀出席会议的还有：世界和平理事会等各国际组织的代表。
    日本和平代表团黑田寿男等六人也参加了会议。
    大会会场庄严美丽。会场入口处的两旁竖立着五十个国家的国旗，对面的墙壁上悬挂着世界民主青年联盟的大幅盟旗。主席台上丝绒帷幕上悬挂着世界民主青年联盟的巨大盟徽。会场四周花团锦簇。厅堂内的灯光，映射着廊柱上的彩饰，灿烂辉煌。会场上安装着的译意风，可以把代表们的报告和发言同时用中、俄、法、英、西班牙等五国文字传送给参加会议的人们。
    四时，会议开始。世界民主青年联盟主席柏尼尼首先致开会词。他宣布世界民主青年联盟理事会会议开幕后，并请经过世界民主青年联盟理事会协商拟定的大会主席团登临主席台。这时全场响起了热烈的掌声。

    会议接着由执行主席廖承志主持。
    会场以热烈的掌声欢迎世界民主青年联盟主席布伦诺·柏尼尼所作的关于会议第一项议程的报告。
    柏尼尼说，今天千百万青年还生活在被殖民主义者奴役的非人道的境地。地球上几乎半数的人口
  （占百分之四十四）生活在殖民地和附属国家中。在反法西斯战争胜利之后，殖民地人民争取从压迫下解放自己的国家、争取自己的国家在和平劳动中繁荣兴盛的斗争，一年比一年、一月比一月、一天比一天地更加壮大而无敌了。人类历史上从来没有过这样大规模的运动。有些整个国家的人民从殖民制度的枷锁下解放出来，获得了完全的独立。另外
  一些国家的人民已经坚决地走上这条民族解放的道路。殖民制度的基础已经动摇了。中华人民共和国的成立震撼了整个殖民世界，朝鲜和越南人民反对侵略者的巨大胜利也具有重要的历史意义。
    柏尼尼说，殖民地和附属国家人民的迅速觉醒，以及他们为争取独立、和平等神圣权利所进行的英勇斗争，对于争取全世界和平与进步这一全人类共同事业的贡献，愈来愈大而难以估量。青年就在这个强大运动的最前列斗争着。
    柏尼尼列举了许多事实和具体数字，说明殖民主义和外国的统治，在一切方面，都是造成殖民地国家人民和青年严重贫困的根本原因。他说，我们宣称：一个真正集体安全与保卫和平的政策，应当建筑在各个不同社会制度可以共存、不干涉他国内政、相互了解，以及通过政治协商解决一切国际纠纷等原则之上。最近发生的事件吸引了全世界的公众舆论。印度支那停火协定的达成、周恩来先生与尼赫鲁先生和缅甸总理的会谈，这一切事实表明了通过和平方法解决一切悬而未决的国际问题的可能性以及各国不分政治制度和平共处的可能性。这些事件为和平解决一切国际问题和缓和国际紧张局势开辟了新的远景，全世界的爱好和平人士为此表示庆贺。
    柏尼尼说，十分明显，殖民主义者可以任意摆布殖民地和附属国家命运的时代已经一去不复返了。他叙述了中国、朝鲜、越南和其他许多国家的人民和青年反对殖民统治和争取民族独立的伟大胜利后指出，殖民地和附属国的人民和青年完全了解到：自由、幸福以及生活的快乐只有在和平环境中才可能得到。因此，青年日益广泛地参加到世界和平运动的一切活动和斗争中来。殖民地附属国家的青年认识到：一切破坏和平的企图，不论采取什么形式，都严重地威胁着他们的生存。青年们坚决反对一切军事侵略条约和军备竞赛，反对把他们的国家以及各国人民拖入军事集团和公约，反对在他们的领土上建立军事基地。青年们坚决要求禁止使用原子武器、氢武器、以及一切大规模毁灭性的武器。
    柏尼尼强调指出，在目前情况下，最突出的特点，就是全世界各国青年与殖民地和附属国青年的国际团结的普遍性。像这样强有力的团结运动，是前所未见的。今后，对殖民地国家青年的兄弟般的团结，将成为一切国家民主青年运动的生活与活动的一部分。柏尼尼说明世界民主青年联盟是根据下列原则进行活动的，即一切国家、一切种族、一切宗教信仰和政治倾向的青年间的友爱、平等和友谊。忠实于这些原则的世界民主青年联盟，始终高举着争取被压迫国家青年的自由、民族独立与美好前途的战斗的旗帜。它用各种不同的形式来表示对这些国家的青年的深厚的团结。柏尼尼指出：世界青联各会员组织应当经常注意加强殖民地和附属国青年争取自由与民族独立的斗争活动。青年们应当更加坚决地起来反对以任何方式干涉这些国家的内政。世界青联各会员组织应当把为自由与民族独立的斗争，与争取生活权利、实现最迫切的要求的斗争联系起来。
    殖民地与附属国青年应该以最大的热情起来反对一切军事侵略行为，反对一切外国干涉这些国家的内政，反对把这些国家拖入军事集团，反对在这些国家的领土上设立军事基地以及反对军备竞赛。
    为了实现这一切公平合理的要求，世界青联的会员组织应当在最广大的城乡青年群众中，展开解释、教育和组织的工作。各会员组织应特别注意邀请新的青年群众参加他们的组织的活动，加紧工作，扩大自己的影响，这样来巩固自己的组织。柏尼尼并号召各国青年组织，团结一致，为反对殖民主义和外国统治，争取青年的美好生活而斗争。
    柏尼尼的报告受到热烈欢迎。
    会议在休息十五分钟以后，进行大会的发言。先后发言的有法国、南非、巴西、日本四个国家的代表。他们一致拥护世界民主青年联盟主席布伦诺·柏尼尼的报告。
    法国代表利昂·克劳德·罗兰奇说，我们应当告诉我们国家的统治者，用武力压迫殖民地人民的时代已经过去了。今后唯一的方法是用维护各个民族人民利益的和平协商的方法来解决国际间的一切争端。他为印度支那的停战而欢呼，祝贺越南、高棉、寮国的人民和青年第一次获得了和平的生活。他表示法国青年要和全世界各国青年、特别是殖民地国家的青年团结一致，为青年的美好远景而斗争。法国代表讲话结束时，出席会议的越南、寮国和法国的青年代表纷纷走出自己的座位，互相握手、拥抱、亲吻。全场一再为这三个国家青年的友谊而热烈鼓掌。
    南非代表艾·萨克斯说：南非是受着民族压迫和种族歧视的国家，人民被剥夺了生活的、教育的和选举的权利，监牢里关满了青年人。但是，他又指出，南非青年就在这样极度困难、艰苦的情况下，仍高举着“和平、友谊和种族融洽”的旗帜，和一切有色人种及正义的白种人联合在一起，为和平、民族独立和青年权利而进行了不屈的斗争。他说，亚洲一些国家已挣脱和正在挣脱殖民主义枷锁的榜样，也将在非洲实现。
    巴西代表保罗·里伯里罗在发言中列举了许多巴西在政治上、经济上、文化上和军事上日益殖民地化的事实，说明柏尼尼关于第一项议程的报告的正确和及时。发言者详细地叙述了巴西人民反对殖民统治和美巴（西）军事协定的各种斗争。并表示巴西青年将和全国人民一起为保卫民族主权而努力奋斗。
    日本青年代表山口健二在发言中说，日本在外国占领下已几年了。因此和平对日本来说是最重要的问题。殖民主义和军国主义给日本人民和青年带来了悲惨的生活，这使日本人民和青年更加感到祖国的独立的需要。他预祝会议的胜利和成功。
    开幕式在热烈的掌声中结束。（附图片）
