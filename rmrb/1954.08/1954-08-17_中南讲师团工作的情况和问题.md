The Central South Lecturers’ Group has been established for over three years. Except during the “Three-Anti” Movement, it has been conducting teaching work continuously under the direct leadership of the Party Committee.

In April 1951, the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau of the CPC established the Wuhan Municipal Cadre Marxist-Leninist Night School. The Lecturers’ Group, composed of 52 leading comrades from the Party, government, and military organs stationed in Wuhan and lecturers from various universities, was formed to undertake the teaching tasks of the night school. They taught courses such as "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism," "Basic Problems of the Chinese Revolution," and "Political Common Sense," adhering to a system of six lectures per week. After the end of the “Three-Anti” Movement, in coordination with the Party consolidation and building work, the Lecturers’ Group made four reports on the eight criteria for Party members at the Central South Directly Subordinate Organs Activists’ Conference, and gave two radio reports on the Central South People’s Broadcasting Station. During the study of the documents of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and Stalin’s "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau, in addition to organizing lecturers to give 21 lectures and 4 Q&A sessions to theoretical instructors and study backbones in the intermediate and primary groups in a planned manner, also organized four thematic reports. Last July, when studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," the lecturers lectured on Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" five times (including two thematic reports), and on the "Reader on Common Sense of Economic Construction" (the first four chapters) twelve times. When studying the Party's general line during the transition period, the Central South Lecturers' Group underwent an adjustment. After the adjustment, the Lecturers' Group was still headed by Comrade Zhao Yimin, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau, with Comrade Pan Zinian, Deputy Director of the Central South Cultural and Educational Committee, and Comrade Li Fanfu, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau, as deputy heads. Currently, the Central South Lecturers' Group has 62 lecturers, including 31 at the ministerial level, 19 at the bureau and division chief level, and 12 university presidents, deans, and lecturers. When studying the general line, the Lecturers' Group gave five lectures on five topics to all cadres in the senior group of the Central South Directly Subordinate Organs (some people from Hubei Province and Wuhan City also attended), as well as theoretical instructors in the intermediate and primary groups, and gave one Q&A report.

The establishment of the Central South Lecturers’ Group has created favorable conditions for the development of theoretical learning and the strengthening of theoretical propaganda in the Central South Directly Subordinate Organs. The Wuhan Municipal Cadre Marxist-Leninist Night School, where the Central South Lecturers’ Group taught, initially trained over 900 study backbones and activists, of which 543 were theoretical instructors. These study backbones and activists were dispersed in various organs, and most played a exemplary and leading role in their studies. When studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and the "Reader on Common Sense of Economic Construction," the lecturers lectured in detail on the various sections to 208 part-time theoretical instructors in the intermediate and primary groups of the Central South Bureau Directly Subordinate Organs. Before the lectures, they emphasized the main points and teaching requirements of each chapter (section) and introduced relevant reference materials, which not only enabled the theoretical instructors to learn ahead of time but also improved the teaching quality of the theoretical instructors. The work of the Lecturers' Group also played a supervisory role in the lecturers' own learning. To teach well, one must first learn well. The vast majority of lecturers could spare time to prepare their lessons carefully and write their lecture outlines or notes before giving lectures. Therefore, many lecturers felt that they had benefited greatly after giving lectures. In addition, the organization of the Lecturers' Group also organized a strong force on the theoretical propaganda front, which played a role in every propaganda movement. For example, during the commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China and the publication of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," the Central South Lecturers’ Group, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, wrote articles for newspapers and magazines in a planned manner and gave speeches at cadre meetings. The book "Basic Knowledge of Communist Party Members of China," written by the lecturers, has been distributed over 1.3 million copies. All of these have played a certain role in strengthening theoretical propaganda.

The above-mentioned achievements of the Central South Lecturers' Group are primarily due to the attention and support of the Party Committee and the administrative leaders of various departments, which is the key to doing a good job in the Lecturers' Group. For the past three years, the Central South Bureau and the administrative leaders of various departments have consistently paid attention to the work of the Lecturers' Group. When the Lecturers' Group was first established, Comrade Deng Zihui, Third Secretary of the Central South Bureau, not only mobilized the lecturers but also took the lead in giving lectures himself. In addition, Comrade Li Xuefeng, Second Deputy Secretary of the Central South Bureau, and Comrade Li Xiannian, Third Deputy Secretary, also gave lectures to cadres. The Central South Bureau Study Central Group sometimes also discussed the lecturers' lecture outlines or assigned specific personnel to give lectures, which had good results.

Secondly, the lecturers are active and serious about teaching work. All the lecturers in the Lecturers' Group are part-time, and their time and energy are greatly limited. However, because they recognize that giving lectures is a glorious task entrusted to them by the Party, most lecturers can actively carry out teaching work. According to statistics, from the autumn of 1952 to March 1954, a total of 29 lecturers gave lectures to theoretical instructors or gave reports on current affairs and policies (excluding those who gave lectures and reports to cadres in their own organs). In order to give good lectures, most lecturers have worked hard to study and prepare lessons carefully. Some have also solicited the opinions of theoretical instructors in their affiliated units before lecturing. In addition, they also designated some necessary reference books to enable theoretical instructors to further study in depth after listening to the lectures. Therefore, the lectures of the lecturers are generally welcomed by the broad masses of cadres, who believe that they are theoretical, practical, and analytical, and are very helpful to the cadres.

Thirdly, the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau provides specific guidance to the Lecturers’ Group. The Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau has carried out the following specific tasks in guiding the Lecturers’ Group: (1) Formulating a teaching plan for a certain period; (2) Assigning lecturers to lecture tasks, introducing and supplying reference materials; (3) Providing lecture outlines and reviewing lecture outlines or notes; (4) Organizing the Lecturers’ Group to summarize and exchange teaching experiences. At the same time, in order to effectively help lecturers do a good job in lecturing, the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau entrusted the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central South Directly Subordinate Organs Committee with the following tasks in the later stage: (1) According to the course assignments, invite lecturers for the Marxist-Leninist Night School of the Central South Directly Subordinate Organs; (2) Reflect the students' ideological situation and their requirements and opinions on teaching to the lecturers; (3) Supervise the lecturers to prepare lessons and collect difficult questions in learning; (4) Report the teaching situation, difficulties, and requirements of the lecturers to the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau on a regular basis. In addition, a card reporting system was implemented, that is, after each lesson (unit) was completed, the sub-Party committees collected and summarized the cadres' opinions on the lecturers' lectures, filled out unified cards, and submitted them to the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau for review at any time, in order to understand the situation and improve the lecturers' teaching work.

The work of the Central South Lecturers’ Group still has many shortcomings. We believe that the following issues should be addressed in the future:

First, it is necessary to strengthen the regular organizational work of the Lecturers’ Group and overcome the phenomenon of being tight at the beginning and loose at the end. In the early stage of establishment, the leadership grasped the work of the Lecturers’ Group more tightly, had specially assigned cadres, the teaching system was relatively formal, and three research groups were established by subject, adopting the method of division of labor, collective research to improve the quality of the lecturers. However, in the later stage, the Lecturers' Group was grasped more loosely, no one was responsible for management, and the lecturers were simply assigned lecture tasks, lacking regular guidance and assistance. Therefore, in the lecturing process, sometimes it was found that the lecturing content was repeated or the connection between the front and back was not smooth, and some lecturers affected the teaching effect due to insufficient preparation.

In order to strengthen the organizational work of the Lecturers’ Group and improve the quality of teaching, a plenary meeting of the Lecturers’ Group should be held at least once or twice a year to discuss teaching plans, study division of labor, and exchange teaching experiences. At the same time, the lecture outlines or notes written by the lecturers before the lectures should be studied by the following methods according to units (or chapters): (1) Organize relevant lecturers to study together, so as to exchange information and overcome the problem of repetition or disconnection in lectures; (2) The lecturers should first conduct research in the central group (or senior group) they participate in, so as to combine teaching with learning, on the one hand, they can gather ideas, and on the other hand, they can promote learning; (3) Lecturers should convene a group of theoretical instructors to conduct research together and solicit their opinions, so as to enable lecturers to better meet the requirements of the audience. However, no matter what method is adopted, it should be reviewed by the Party committee propaganda department in the end. In order to be able to regularly organize the above specific work, it is necessary to set up dedicated management cadres.

Second, it is necessary to strengthen specific assistance to lecturers. In the past, due to insufficient attention to this aspect and insufficient cadres, it was not possible to regularly provide unified lecture outlines (or key points) and relevant teaching materials for lecturers' reference; at the same time, it was not possible to summarize and exchange teaching experiences in a timely manner, and to help lecturers in terms of lecturing methods. In addition, regularly reflecting cadres' requirements and opinions on lectures to lecturers has not been done well enough, and the implemented card reporting method has not been fully used to play its due role. In the future, we should further strengthen specific assistance to lecturers. Before lecturers give lectures, we should provide them with reference materials as much as possible around the lecture topics, and compile or excerpt relevant arguments from the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong into outlines or materials, so that lecturers can easily check and refer to them when preparing lessons; at the same time, we must adhere to and improve the lecture card reporting system, timely reflect the ideological situation of cadres and their opinions and requirements on lectures, and according to the difficult questions existing in cadres' learning and the key points of debate in discussions, organize and distribute them to lecturers for reference or study and answer at any time. In addition, we must pay attention to summarizing and promoting good teaching experiences and overcome shortcomings in teaching, so as to improve the teaching quality of lecturers.

Third, it is necessary to give full play to the strength of all lecturers and appropriately expand the scope of activities of the Lecturers’ Group. Although the Central South Lecturers’ Group has a large number of people, it has failed to give full play to the strength of all lecturers. For example, some lecturers have not given a single lecture until now, and the lecture tasks are often concentrated on some lecturers. Secondly, the lecturers' activity surface is also relatively narrow, especially in the later activities. In addition to giving lectures at the Marxist-Leninist Night School, propaganda on the Party's policies or the planned organization of some academic lectures are not done well enough. In the future, we should more systematically assign lecturers to lecture tasks and appropriately expand the scope of activities of the Lecturers’ Group in order to strengthen Marxist-Leninist propaganda.

Fourth, in implementing the principle of linking theory with practice, we believe that we cannot demand too much from lecturers. Generally speaking, it should be: (1) Be able to clearly explain the historical background of the theory in lectures; (2) Be able to use the practice of the Chinese revolution to explain certain principles in the theory; (3) Be able to explain the importance of studying a certain theoretical problem to the current revolution; (4) Be able to start from the level of the audience.

Fifth, in possible conditions, allocate a certain number of full-time lecturers. Because lecturers are all part-time responsible cadres, original courses are often not taught due to temporary participation in important meetings or going out, and therefore, the order of classes is often reversed, or other lecturers are temporarily invited to give lectures, which affects the scheduled completion of the teaching plan. Of course, under the current circumstances, fully using and giving play to the strength and enthusiasm of part-time lecturers is still the main thing, but in order to help part-time lecturers give lectures and improve teaching quality, and to better ensure the completion of the teaching plan for training theoretical instructors, it is necessary to equip a certain number of full-time lecturers under possible conditions.

    中南讲师团工作的情况和问题
    中共中央中南局宣传部理论宣传处
    中南讲师团建立到现在已有三年多，除“三反”运动期间外，一直在党委直接领导下没有间断地进行着教学工作。
    一九五一年四月，中南局宣传部举办武汉市机关马克思列宁主义夜校，即由驻武汉市的党、政、军机关的负责同志和各大学的讲师五十二人组成讲师团，担任夜校的教学任务，讲授“马克思列宁主义基础”、“中国革命基本问题”和“政治常识”等课程，坚持了每周讲课六次的制度。“三反”运动结束后，为配合整党建党工作，讲师团曾在中南直属机关积极分子会议上，先后作过四次关于党员标准八项条件的报告，并在中南人民广播电台作广播报告两次。在学习联共（布）第十九次代表大会文件和斯大林著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”时，中南局宣传部除了较有计划地组织讲师对中、初级组理论教员和学习骨干作了二十一次的讲课及四次疑难问题解答外，并组织了四次专题报告。去年七月学习“联共（布）党史”时，讲师们曾分别讲授“联共（布）党史”第九章五次（其中专题报告二次），
  “经济建设常识读本”（前四章）十二次。学习党在过渡时期总路线时，中南讲师团作了一次调整。调整后的讲师团仍由中南局宣传部部长赵毅敏同志担任团长，另聘中南文教委员会副主任潘梓年同志和中南局宣传部副部长李凡夫同志担任副团长。现中南讲师团共有讲师六十二人，其中部长级干部三十一人，局、处长级干部十九人，大学校长、院长和讲师十二人。学习总路线时，讲师团就五个专题对中南直属机关（湖北省、武汉市也有人参加旁听）高级组全体干部和中、初级组理论教员进行了五次讲授，并作了一次问题解答报告。
    中南讲师团的成立对于中南直属机关干部理论学习的开展和理论宣传战线的加强，创造了有利的条件。由中南讲师团担任讲课的武汉市机关马克思列宁主义夜校，首次培养了学习骨干和学习积极分子九百余人，其中有五百四十三人是理论教员，这些学习骨干和学习积极分子分散在各机关内，大部分在学习中起了示范带头作用。学习“联共（布）党史”和“经济建设常识读本”时，讲师又分节向中南局直属机关中、初级组二百零八个兼职理论教员进行了详细的讲授，并在讲授前着重指出每章
  （节）的讲授要点和教学要求，介绍了有关的参考资料，不但使理论教员先学一步，并且提高了理论教员的教学质量。讲师团工作对讲师本身学习来说，也起了督促作用。要教好，就必须自己学好。绝大多数的讲师在讲课之前，都能尽量挤出时间来认真准备功课，并写好讲授提纲或讲义。所以很多讲师都感到讲课以后获益很大。此外，有了讲师团的组织，还在理论宣传战线上组织起一支有力的队伍，在每个宣传运动中发挥了作用。例如，在纪念中国共产党成立三十周年和“毛泽东选集”出版时，中南讲师团都曾在党委的统一领导下，有计划地给报刊撰写论文和在干部会上讲演，讲师们所撰写的“中国共产党党员基本知识讲话”一书，发行达一百三十余万册。所有这些，对于加强理论宣传工作都起了一定的作用。
    中南讲师团之所以取得上述成绩，首先是党委和各部门行政负责同志的重视和支持，这是搞好讲师团工作的主要关键。三年来，中南局和各部门行政负责同志对于讲师团的工作一直是重视的。讲师团刚成立时，中南局第三书记邓子恢同志不但动员讲师，而且还亲自带头进行讲课。此外，中南局第二副书记李雪峰和第三副书记李先念等同志也曾给干部讲过课。中南局学习中心组，有时还讨论讲师的讲授提纲，或推定专人去讲课，效果都很好。
    其次是讲师对教学工作的积极认真。讲师团全体讲师都是兼职的，他们的时间和精力都有很大的限制，然而由于他们认识到担任讲课是党交给自己的光荣任务，大部分讲师都能积极地进行教学工作。据统计，从一九五二年秋季到一九五四年三月为止，给理论教员讲课或作过时事政策报告的讲师，共计二十九人（给其本机关干部上课、报告的不在内）。讲师们为了把课讲好，大部分都做到刻苦钻研、认真准备功课，有的在讲授前还征求所属单位理论教员的意见。此外，还指定一些必要的参考书籍，以便使理论教员在听课后进一步深入钻研。所以讲师的讲课大都受到广大干部的欢迎，被认为讲得有理论、有实际、有分析，对干部很有帮助。
    再次是中南局宣传部对讲师团的具体指导。中南局宣传部在指导讲师团方面曾进行了下面几项具体工作：（一）制订一定时期的教学计划；（二）分配讲师讲授任务，介绍和供给参考资料；（三）提供讲授纲要，审查讲授提纲或讲义；（四）组织讲师团总结和交流教学经验。同时，中南局宣传部为了有效地帮助讲师作好讲授工作，在后期并委托中共中南直属机关委员会宣传部负责下列工作：
  （一）根据课程的分配，为中南直属机关马克思列宁主义夜校约请讲师；（二）向讲师反映学员的思想情况以及对教学的要求和意见；（三）督促讲师准备功课，搜集学习疑难问题；（四）定期向中南局宣传部汇报讲师的教学情况、困难和要求。此外，还实行了卡片汇报制度，即在每课（单元）讲完后，由分党委收集和综合干部对讲师讲授的意见，填写统一制订的卡片，随时送交中南局宣传部审查，以便了解情况，改进讲师的教学工作。
    中南的讲师团工作目前还存在着不少缺点。我们认为今后应当注意解决以下几个问题：
    第一、必须加强讲师团的经常组织工作，克服前紧后松的现象。开始成立的一个时期，领导上对于讲师团的工作抓得较紧，设有专管的干部，教学制度也比较正规，并分科成立三个研究小组，采用分工讲授、集体研究的办法来提高讲师质量。但后一阶段对讲师团抓得就比较松，没有专人负责管理，对讲师只是单纯的分配讲课任务，缺乏经常的指导和帮助。因此，在讲授过程中，有时发现讲授内容重复或前后衔接不上的毛病，也有的讲师因备课不够充分，影响教学效果。
    为了加强对讲师团组织方面的工作，提高教学的质量，讲师团的全体会议每年至少应召开一次至两次，讨论教学计划，研究分工和交流教学经验。同时，讲师在课前写好的讲授提纲或讲义，应争取按单元（或章）分别采取以下方法进行研究：（一）组织有关讲师共同研究，以便互通消息，克服讲课时彼此重复或互不衔接的毛病；（二）讲师先在其所参加的中心组（或高级组）内进行研究，使教学与学习结合起来，一方面可以集思广益，另方面也可推动学习；（三）讲师召集一部分理论教员共同进行研究，征求其意见，以便使讲师更能满足听众的要求。但无论采用什么方法，最后都应经过党委宣传部门的审查。为了能经常组织上述具体工作，设专管的干部是必要的。
    第二、必须加强对讲师的具体帮助。过去由于对这方面注意得不够，干部不足，因而没有能经常地提出统一的讲授纲要（或要点）和有关教学资料以供讲师参考；同时也未能及时总结和交流教学经验，从讲授方法上帮助讲师。此外，经常地给讲师反映干部对讲授的要求和意见也作得不够，已实行的卡片汇报办法，尚未充分使它起到应有的作用。今后应进一步加强对讲师的具体帮助，在讲师讲课前，应围绕讲授课题尽可能地给他们提供参考材料，将马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林及毛泽东同志著作中有关论据编成纲目或摘录成资料，使讲师备课时容易查对参考；同时，要坚持和健全讲课卡片汇报制度，及时反映干部的思想情况以及对讲授的意见和要求，并根据干部在学习中存在的疑难问题和在讨论时的争论要点，随时整理发给讲师参考或研究后作解答。此外，还须注意总结和推广好的教学经验，克服教学中的缺点，以便提高讲师的教学质量。
    第三、必须充分发挥全体讲师的力量，适当扩大讲师团活动范围。中南讲师团人数虽不少，但未能充分发挥全体讲师的力量。例如有的讲师直到现在还没有讲过一次课，往往把讲课任务集中在部分讲师身上。其次，讲师活动面也较窄，特别是在后期的活动中，除了在马克思列宁主义夜校上课以外，关于党的政策宣传，或是平时有计划的组织一些学术讲演等，都是作得不够的。今后应更有计划地分配讲师讲授任务和适当地扩大讲师团的活动范围，以便加强马克思列宁主义宣传。
    第四、在贯彻理论联系实际方面，我们认为对讲师不能要求过高。一般地说应该：（一）在讲课时，能够把理论产生的历史背景讲述清楚；（二）能用中国革命的实践说明理论中的某些原理；（三）能说明学习某一理论问题对当前革命的重要性；
  （四）能从听众的水平出发。
    第五、在可能的条件下，配置一定数量的专职讲师。因为讲师都是兼职的负责干部，常因临时参加重要会议或外出，使原订课程不能讲授，因之，经常发生上课顺序颠倒，或临时聘请其他讲师代讲的现象，影响教学计划的按期完成。当然，在目前的情况下，充分使用和发挥兼职讲师的力量和积极性，还是主要的，但为了帮助兼职讲师讲课和提高教学质量，更好地保证训练理论教员的教学计划的完成，有必要在可能的条件下配备一定数量的专职讲师。
