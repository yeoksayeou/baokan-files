Fuzhou Automobile Maintenance Depot Successfully Trials Six-Wheeled Vehicle Towing

The Fuzhou Automobile Maintenance Depot, under the Fuzhou Transportation Bureau of Fujian Province, successfully trialed six-wheeled vehicle towing in early July.

Last August, the Fuzhou Automobile Maintenance Depot successfully trialed ten-wheeled truck towing. However, this type of vehicle only accounts for a portion of the vehicles in Fujian Province. Even if all the ten-wheeled vehicles were to implement towing, it would still not meet the growing transportation demands. The planned cargo turnover for the third quarter of this year is more than 16% higher than the actual performance of the second quarter. Therefore, the leaders of the Fuzhou Automobile Maintenance Depot put forward the requirement of trialing six-wheeled vehicle towing to the workers. They repeatedly explained the significance of trialing six-wheeled vehicle towing to the workers, organized drivers to learn the technical operation methods of automobile towing, and studied the engine performance of six-wheeled vehicles. The director and other responsible comrades personally led the drivers in a six-wheeled vehicle towing trial on the roads around Fuzhou city. Through this series of measures, they basically reversed the conservative idea of some workers who believed that six-wheeled vehicles could not be towed. On June 28th, seven six-wheeled vehicles, towing seven trailers and carrying more than 30 tons of cargo, set off for Songyu along the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway for a trial run.

As the trailer convoy traveled on the highway, it carried out a "routine maintenance" every 30 to 40 kilometers, checking the tires, steering system, and chassis. When the convoy had to pass through some difficult sections, the drivers held timely meetings to exchange operational experience. On July 2nd, all seven tow trucks and trailers safely returned to Fuzhou. In the round trip of 1,280 li, not even one breakdown occurred.

The success of this trial resulted in a cargo capacity increase of more than 29% and a saving of 130 kilograms of gasoline. Based on this achievement, if all the six-wheeled vehicles of the Fuzhou Automobile Maintenance Depot were to implement towing, they could operate more than 3.5 million ton-kilometers per year. At the same time, they could save 120,000 kilograms of gasoline, resulting in a total value of increased production and savings of 10.3 billion yuan.

### 福州汽车保养场试用六轮车拖载成功

    福州汽车保养场试用六轮车拖载成功
    福建省福州运输处所属福州汽车保养场，于七月初试验六轮车拖载成功。
    去年八月福州汽车保养场试验十轮大货车拖载成功，但这一类车在福建省只占一部分，即使所有的十轮车都实行拖载也不能满足日益增长的运输要求。今年第三季度货物周转量计划比第二季度实绩超过百分之十六强，于是福州汽车保养场领导上向职工们提出了试用六轮车拖载的要求，并向职工反复说明试验六轮车拖载的意义，组织驾驶员学习汽车拖载的技术操作方法，研究六轮车引擎性能等。场长及其他负责同志并亲自带领驾驶员，在福州城郊公路进行了一次六轮车拖载的试验。通过这一系列的措施，基本上扭转了某些职工认为六轮车不能拖载的保守想法。六月二十八日，七辆六轮车拖着七辆挂车，载着三十多吨货物，沿着福厦公路向目的地嵩屿出发试行了。
    拖车队行进在公路上，每行驶三十到四十公里，就进行一次“例行保养”，检查轮胎、转向系、底盘各部。车队要通过一些难走的地方，驾驶员们就及时开会交流操作经验。七月二日，七辆拖车连同挂车全部安全返回福州。在往返一千二百八十华里的路程中，连一次抛锚事故也没有发生。
    这一次试验成功结果，运量提高了百分之二十九强，节省汽油一百三十公斤。就拿这个成绩来推算，福州汽车保养场的六轮车如果全部实行拖载，一年可多运行三百五十多万吨公里，同时可节省汽油十二万公斤，增产节约价值共一百零三亿元。
