    New Autumn Fabric Designs
    The sample selection and design personnel of the China Textile, Yarn and Cloth Company's Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station, together with technical personnel from various processing factories, have newly designed many beautiful autumn fabric patterns this year. Since July, many new varieties have already begun production. The "Peacock Displaying its Tail" fabric produced by the station last year was warmly welcomed by consumers. In the third quarter of this year, the production of peacock-type fabric patterns will be twice as much as in the same period last year. Before the end of July, more than 20,000 bolts of Peacock and Phoenix large-patterned serge and drill produced by the joint state-private New Feng Printing and Dyeing Factory had been purchased by various regions; the Peacock and Peony large-patterned drill and serge planned to be produced by the joint state-private Rong Feng Textile Factory have already received advance orders for more than 40,000 bolts from various regions. This year, Shanghai has newly designed several "Shadow Flower" patterns, adding harmonious colored flower shadows next to the bright flowers. At present, the joint state-private Guangzhong, Xinguang, and Xinfeng printing and dyeing factories are printing "Shadow Flower" fabrics, which will be available to various regions within this month. Based on consumers' love for small-patterned serge, the East China Administrative Council Textile Bureau recently designed and printed a small-patterned snowflake serge. This serge can be used for clothing or as a quilt cover.

    新花样的秋季花布
    中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站的选样设计人员，今年会同各加工厂技术人员新设计了许多美丽的秋季花布图样。从七月份以来，不少新的品种已经开始生产。去年该站组织生产的“孔雀开屏”花布受到消费者热烈欢迎，今年第三季度，孔雀类型花样的花布将比去年同时期多生产两倍。在七月底以前，公私合营新丰印染厂生产的两万多匹孔雀凤凰大花哔叽和直贡呢，已被各地选购一空；公私合营荣丰染织厂计划生产的孔雀牡丹大花直贡呢和哔叽，已经被各地预订去四万多匹。今年上海市新设计了几种“影花”图样，在鲜艳的花朵旁边加上色泽调和的花影。目前，公私合营的光中、新光、新丰等印染厂正在印制“影花”花布，本月内就可以供应各地。根据消费者对小花哔叽的喜爱，华东行政委员会纺织管理局最近设计、印制了一种小花的雪花哔叽。这种哔叽可作衣料，也可作被面。
