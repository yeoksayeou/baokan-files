    印度尼西亚艺术展览会闭幕
    【新华社二十九日讯】中央人民政府文化部主办的“印度尼西亚艺术展览会”已在二十八日闭幕。展览会自十八日开幕以来，受到北京市人民的热烈欢迎，十天中参观人数共达三万多人，仅二十二日一天就有九千八百多人。
    很多人在参观了展览会以后发表了观感。中央美术学院教授常任侠说：“印度尼西亚艺术是具有民族特色的：颜色强烈，线条雄壮，富有热带的情调。它表现了印度尼西亚古代优秀文化传统，也反映了在发展中的印度尼西亚社会面貌和印度尼西亚人民的生活。”
    名画家郁风说：从这一展览会的作品中，我们更亲切地看到了印度尼西亚人民的生活与和平愿望。
    北京林学院学生张其保在观众意见簿上写道：“这些都是印度尼西亚人民非常珍贵的艺术。”印
