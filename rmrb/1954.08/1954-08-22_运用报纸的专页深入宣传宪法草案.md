    Use Newspaper Special Pages to Promote the Draft Constitution in Depth
    In the recent period of economic propaganda and the propaganda of the Draft Constitution, some newspapers have learned from the experience of the Soviet "Pravda" and published some special pages. Practice has proved that this kind of special page is convenient for carrying out focused and powerful propaganda on a problem, and it is an effective form for newspapers to deepen various propaganda efforts.
    Judging from the adoption of special pages by various newspapers in the propaganda of the Draft Constitution, in order for this form to achieve the purpose of in-depth propaganda, it is necessary to select a basic issue or a certain article of the Draft Constitution for systematic and in-depth explanation. The special page of the Northeast Daily on July 15th, entitled "The Right to Work - A Great Achievement of the Revolution," is an example. Through the personal experiences of industrial and agricultural labor models familiar to the local masses, the special page illustrates that workers today are respected everywhere by the people, and labor and honor are inseparable in New China. The special page also focuses on telling people: we should not only cherish the right to work stipulated in the Draft Constitution, but also exercise it with creative labor. A report stated: Zheng Jianguo, an old electrician and labor model at the construction site of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, told all electricians during the discussion of the Draft Constitution: "People like Zhang Mingshan and Wang Chonglun are the ones who truly exercise their right to work, and we are far behind them!" "I will only repay the motherland with creative labor!" Now, he is studying how to create an automated machine for erecting electric wires. It is clear that the special page takes the glory of labor and the right to work as its central content, and carries out systematic propaganda and explanation through vivid examples, which enables readers to understand the significance of the glory of labor more deeply, and how to strive for and defend this honor. Such propaganda will play a role in mobilizing and organizing the masses.
    To organize a special page well in order to achieve the effect of in-depth propaganda, it is also necessary to carry out concentrated propaganda from all aspects around a central issue. The special page of the Heilongjiang Daily on July 20th, entitled "Abide by the Obligations that Citizens Owe to the State," has relatively broad topics and authors. The authors of the special page include representatives from all walks of life: labor models from machinery factories, basic construction workers, directors of agricultural production cooperatives, model warehouse keepers from state-owned commercial departments, street female resident mediation committee members, private industrialists and businessmen, and the deputy director of the Qiqihar City Federation of Industry and Commerce. Based on their own personal experiences, they spoke from different perspectives about how they would fulfill their obligations to the state as citizens, so the topics were also diverse. Guo Pingwu, a milling worker at the First Machine Tool Plant in Qiqihar City, said in an article that workers had no property in the old society, and capitalists exploited workers by using their property, so workers simply did not want to cherish property. Now that the workers have become the masters of the country, they must ensure that public property does not suffer any losses. For three years, the machine tool he used had not had a single accident. He stated that he would protect state property in production, avoid accidents, and complete the state plan ahead of schedule, in accordance with the obligations stipulated in the constitution. The other authors also expressed their determination to fulfill their civic obligations in their articles, based on the characteristics of their lives, work, and thoughts. It can be seen that the special page concentrates on propaganda on a problem through a wide range of authors and topics, which can connect with more readers and masses, and inspire them to understand the theme promoted by the newspaper from various aspects. At the same time, this propaganda itself also demonstrates the widespread mass nature of the study and discussion of the Draft Constitution, thereby becoming a force to promote the discussion.
    In order to make the propaganda of the Draft Constitution deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the reporting format on the special page should also be diversified to enhance its vividness. The special page of the Tianjin Daily on July 19th, promoting "All Power Belongs to the People," adopted various forms such as essays, impressions, communications, small columns of "figures and facts," and photos, making the special page layout lively and able to attract more readers. The special page of the Shanxi Daily on July 24th, promoting national issues, also published six charts and photos; special pages of some other newspapers also published some propaganda posters, single-panel paintings, illustrations, etc. Most of these pictures are supplementary explanations to accompany the text, and some independently express a thought content; in terms of form, there are different types of paintings, charts, and photos. However, because the vast majority can choose appropriate forms that fit the theme, and are all easy to understand, they have great persuasive power and are welcomed by the majority of readers. The above-mentioned newspapers have already published and are continuing to publish various special pages related to the Draft Constitution. Other newspapers such as the Shanghai Liberation Daily and the Xikang Daily have also begun to adopt this form in this propaganda. Doing so is undoubtedly necessary. But in order for the special page to play a greater role, newspapers should use this form more purposefully and in a planned manner. That is: to arrange the content of the special page in a timely and flexible manner as the discussion of the Draft Constitution deepens in the local area. At the same time, we should also summarize the experience of the special page form at any time, improve its propaganda quality, and appropriately expand this form to various propaganda efforts.

### 运用报纸的专页深入宣传宪法草案

    运用报纸的专页深入宣传宪法草案
    在最近一个时期的经济宣传和宪法草案宣传中，有些报纸学习苏联“真理报”的经验，刊出了一些专页。实践证明：这种专页便于对一个问题进行集中有力的宣传，它是报纸深入各项宣传的一种有效形式。
    从各报在宪法草案宣传中采用专页的情况来看，要使这一形式达到深入宣传的目的，就必须选择宪法草案的某一基本问题或某一条文，进行系统深入的解释。东北日报七月十五日题为“劳动权——革命胜利的伟大成果”的专页，就是一个例子。专页通过当地群众所熟悉的工业和农业劳动模范的亲身经历，说明劳动者今天到处受到人民的尊重，劳动和荣誉在新中国是分不开的。专页还着重告诉人们：我们不仅应该珍视宪法草案中所规定的劳动权，还必须用创造性的劳动来行使它。在一篇报道中说：第一汽车制造厂工地老电工、劳动模范郑建国，在讨论宪法草案的日子里，向全体电工表示：“像张明山、王崇伦才是真正行使了自己的劳动权利的人，而我们和他们差得远！”“我只有用创造性的劳动报答祖国！”现在，他正研究创造一种架设电线的自动化的机器。很明显，专页以劳动光荣和劳动权这一问题为中心内容，通过生动事例进行系统的宣传解释，就能够使读者比较深入地了解到劳动光荣的意义，和应该如何争取和保卫这种荣誉。这样的宣传，是会起到动员和组织群众的作用的。
    要把专页组织得好，以达到深入宣传的效果，还应该围绕一个中心问题，从各方面进行集中的宣传。七月二十日黑龙江日报题为“遵守公民对国家应负的义务”的专页，它的题材和作者，就是比较广泛的。专页的作者包括各阶层的代表人物：机械工厂的劳动模范，基本建设工人，农业生产合作社主任，国营商业部门模范仓库的模范保管员，街道女居民调解委员，私营工商业者、齐齐哈尔市工商业联合会副主任委员。他们根据自己的切身体验，从不同的角度，说出自己将如何遵守公民对国家应尽的义务，因而题材也是多种多样的。齐齐哈尔市第一机床厂铣工郭平武在一篇文章中说，在旧社会里工人没有什么财产，资本家利用他们的财产剥削工人，工人根本不想爱护财产。现在工人成了国家的主人，就要使公共财产不受任何损失。三年来他使的机床没出一次事故。他表示：他将要按照宪法规定的义务，在生产中爱护国家财产，不出事故，提前完成国家计划。另外的几个作者，也都根据自己的生活、工作、思想中的特点，在文章中表达出要尽到公民义务的行动决心。可以看出，专页通过广泛的作者和题材，对一个问题集中起来进行宣传，就能够联系更多的读者群众，并启发他们从各个方面领会报纸所宣传的主题。同时，这种宣传本身，也显示了宪法草案学习讨论中的广泛的群众性，从而成为推动讨论的一种力量。
    要使宪法草案的宣传能够深入人心，还应该使专页上的报道形式多样化，以加强它的生动性。七月十九日天津日报宣传“一切权力属于人民”的专页，就采用了论文、感想、通讯、“数字和事实”小辟栏、照片等多种多样的形式，使专页版面显得生动活泼，能够吸引住更多的读者。七月二十四日山西日报宣传民族问题的专页，还刊出了六张图表和照片；其他有些报纸的专页，也刊出了一些宣传招贴画、单幅画、插图等。这些图片大多数是配合文字作补充说明的，也有的是独立表达一种思想内容的；在形式上又有画、图表、照片的不同。但因为绝大多数都能选择切合主题的适当的形式，并且都很通俗易懂，因此就有了很大的说服力量，受到了广大读者的欢迎。上述这几个报纸，已经并正在继续刊出有关宪法草案的各种专页。其他如上海解放日报、西康日报等报，也都开始在这一宣传中采用这种形式。这样做无疑是必要的。但为了使专页发挥更大的作用，报纸还应该对这种形式更有目的有计划地加以运用。这就是：要随着当地宪法草案讨论的深入开展，及时灵活地安排专页的内容。同时也应该随时总结专页形式的经验，提高它的宣传质量，适当地把这种形式扩大到各项宣传当中去。
