Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: The representatives of the British Labour Party delegation spent their eleventh day in China today. The representatives continued their visits this morning and had extensive contact with people from all walks of life in the capital.

    Mr. Bevan, Mr. Burke, Mr. Watson, Mr. Earnshaw, and Mr. Franklin traveled by car to Tiancun in the western suburbs of Beijing this morning, where 481 households reside, to visit the agricultural production cooperative there. Farmers in Tiancun entertained the British guests with peanuts, corn, and sweet potatoes they had grown themselves.

    The guests saw the farmers working in the cooperative's fields. Last year, the yield from this land doubled compared to before liberation. They also saw one of the two electric pumps installed on wells for irrigation, with the help of government loans. Thanks to government loans, the farmers have been able to purchase improved seeds and new-style farm tools.

    In the home of a township people's congress representative and member of the cooperative, the British guests saw three healthy children and learned that their older brother had starved to death in this village before liberation.

    The Labour Party representatives also visited an elementary school in the township and met three hundred happy children and their nine teachers.

    In the morning, Shi Jinmo, a famous traditional Chinese medicine doctor with forty-eight years of experience, visited Dr. Edith Summerskill, and they discussed various aspects of traditional Chinese medicine. Afterwards, Dr. Summerskill visited the Traditional Chinese Medicine Advanced Studies School.

    Dr. Summerskill also visited the Dongsi Nursery Station Three. This nursery station takes care of eighty children during the day, enabling their parents to work. This nursery station is one of many established in Beijing after liberation.

    At noon, Dr. Summerskill visited a family.

    英工党代表团在京继续参观
    【新华社二十四日讯】英国工党代表团的代表们今天在中国度过第十一天。代表们今天上午继续进行参观，并和首都各界人民广泛接触。
    比万先生、伯克先生、华生先生、厄恩萧先生和弗兰克林先生今日上午乘车到北京西郊有四百八十一户人家的田村，参观了那里的农业生产合作社。田村农民用他们自己种植的花生、玉蜀黍和白薯招待英国客人。
    客人们看到农民在合作社的田地里耕作的情况。去年，这块田地的产量比解放前增加了一倍。他们还看到在政府贷款的帮助下，两部装置在井上供灌溉用的电动抽水机的一部。由于有了政府的贷款，农民们已有能力购买改良的种子和新式的农具。
    在一个乡人民代表大会代表、合作社社员的家里，英国客人们看到三个健康的儿童，并且得知，在这个村庄解放以前，他们的哥哥饿死了。
    工党代表们还参观了这个乡的一所小学，和三百个幸福的儿童和他们的九个老师会了面。
    在上午，行医四十八年的名中医施今墨，访晤了埃迪思·萨末斯基尔博士，他们谈论了中医的各个方面。接着，萨末斯基尔博士参观了中医进修学校。
    萨末斯基尔博士还参观了东四托儿所三站。这个托儿站在白天照料八十个儿童，使他们的父母可以工作。这个托儿站是北京市解放后建立的许多托儿站的一个。
    中午，萨末斯基尔博士访问了一个家庭。
