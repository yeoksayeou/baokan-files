    When the directive from the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding exceeding production targets reached Wugong Village in Raoyang County, it was the season when the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative had just finished the summer production competition and was waiting for the harvest. On the cooperative's more than 4,200 mu of cultivated land, a scene of abundant harvest was displayed: the millet ears drooped heavily; the sorghum reddened; foot-long corn cobs grew on corn stalks as tall as the eaves; the blooming yellow peanut flowers resembled patches of green and gold carpets; although the fruit branches at the top of the cotton plants were still blooming, there were already more than ten cotton bolls at the bottom, which would soon spit out white fibers; more than 1,000 mu of late autumn crops planted after wheat had also been hoed for the last time. The co-op members stood tall and proud, especially happy, and were preparing to rest for a few days to welcome the harvest.
    All the cadres of the cooperative's management committee believed that after the efforts of the spring and summer seasons, the good crops now growing were the most favorable foundation for implementing the Hebei Provincial Party Committee's directive on exceeding production targets. As long as the late-stage management of the crops is strengthened, the late autumn crops are fertilized again, and the autumn harvest is well organized, there is an absolute certainty of exceeding the plan. After carefully studying the methods for increasing production and making careful calculations, the cadres discovered that they could harvest 80,000 jin more grain than originally planned. They themselves felt unexpectedly excited. Zhang Zhensheng, the secretary of the CCP branch in the cooperative, said: "This is a contribution to the country, this is our glory." This glorious over-production plan was supported by many co-op members, but some people thought it would not work. Some co-op members believed that this year's manpower and land fertility had been exhausted, and the crops were growing well enough, so it was impossible to exceed production targets. Others said: "Hanging up the hoe after the Autumn Equinox is an old rule passed down from our ancestors. Don't waste your energy. You should rest and prepare for the autumn harvest." In response to these thoughts, the cooperative held a general mobilization meeting for over-production, and after the cooperative cadres explained in detail to all the co-op members the principles of increasing production and loving the country and the specific accounting methods: as long as each of the cooperative's 300+ mu of cotton fields retains one more cotton boll, it can harvest more than 6,880 jin of seed cotton than originally planned; more than 1,000 mu of wheat stubble corn, if various pests are eliminated in time, artificial pollination is carried out in key areas, and fertilizer is applied to ensure large cobs and full grains, each mu can harvest more than 20 jin, and methods such as lifting vines, loosening soil, piling soil, and adding fertilizer can increase the unit area yield of more than 200 mu of sweet potatoes. The above items can exceed the planned production of more than 46,000 jin of grain. According to last year's experience, if precise harvesting and meticulous threshing are achieved, ensuring that every grain returns home, this income can also reach more than 40,000 jin. If only 900 mu of peanuts are harvested and then picked up again, at least 27,000 jin can be harvested. This well-founded and methodical over-production plan encouraged the enthusiasm of all co-op members to increase production. Li Jinzhuo said: "Don't rest. Let's do it! Being able to harvest 80,000 jin more grain is worth the help the country gave us by sending tractors." Lu Molin said: "It can be seen that the fertility of the land has not been exhausted, it depends on whether people have a way."
      Under the slogan of "Strive to harvest 80,000 jin more grain," all men, women, old, and young in the cooperative were mobilized. The scattered sideline activities of each team were temporarily suspended, and each production team formed eleven large teams to prune and protect cotton bolls to step up the work of pruning and topping the cotton. In the more than 300 mu of cotton fields, more than 300 people were active every day, even when it was drizzling, people did not rest. In order to ventilate the lower part of the cotton plants and reduce boll shedding, they readily removed the old leaves at the bottom. The most outstanding cotton pruning work was done by the one hundred or so elderly and middle-aged women in each team. Most of them were not burdened by taking care of children, and their hands had never left the cotton from the time it emerged from the soil to the time it flowered and set bolls. Xu Shukuang, the female captain of the first production team and a communist party member, led the women of the whole team to work continuously for several noons without resting, in order to complete the cotton pruning task ahead of schedule. When their legs ached and their backs sore, they took small benches or broken leather pieces and sat or kneeled between the ridges to prune. No one complained of being tired or bitter. Female co-op member Chen Quan said:
  "Suffering a little now will result in more flowers in the autumn. It is glorious to sell them to the country, and it is convenient to wear them yourself." With so many hands working non-stop, the sixth cotton pruning work on more than 300 mu of cotton was completed on August 16 as planned. The boll shedding rate of cotton decreased from more than 50% before pruning to about 30%.
    On the basis of universally applying coarse fertilizer to late corn, each team also used more than 1,300 jin of fertilizer powder for more than 100 mu of land with weak growth. After inspection, it was also found that some late corn had corn borers. Under the guidance of the technicians of each team, the young co-op members used pots to hold the liquid medicine and irrigated the plants one by one. Because the young members of the Seventh Team brought their high work efficiency into full play, they were the first to irrigate more than 80 mu of late corn before tasseling according to the prescribed standards. In order to help late corn pollination, the team members, with the help of farm technicians, created a method of using the wind power blown out by the insecticide sprayers to help corn pollination, which greatly improved work efficiency.
      "Eliminating the blank land by the fields" is a slogan put forward by the co-op members in the competition. According to preliminary statistics, only the plots of empty land at the ends of fields, edges of fields, and well platforms, etc., were planted with turnips, totaling about eight or nine mu, and each mu can yield at least 2,000 jin.
    All the co-op members not only strived to exceed production targets this year, but also launched a heated fertilizer accumulation competition to lay the foundation for increasing production next year. On August 8, the entire cooperative held a "voluntary weeding day," requiring "one basket of grass per person." On that day, more than 400 people who participated in the weeding exceeded this requirement, averaging 47 baskets of grass per person. Co-op member Li Gengxu alone handed in 149 baskets of green grass. The cooperative plans to take advantage of the season when there is a lot of grass and the weather is hot, to use 50 public pigsties and 68 private pigsties and toilets, and use the high-temperature composting method to accumulate 7.6 million jin of fertilizer by October for autumn cultivation and wheat planting.

    记耿长锁农业生产合作社的超额增产斗争
    新华社记者  文英
    中共河北省委员会关于超额增产的指示到达饶阳县五公村的时候，正是耿长锁农业生产合作社结束了夏季生产竞赛，挂锄等收的季节。全社四千二百多亩耕地上，呈现着一片丰收景象：谷子穗沉甸甸地低着头；高粱红了眼；房檐高的玉米秸上长着一尺多长的大棒子；盛开着黄色小花的花生地，像一块块绿色点金的大地毯；棉棵上部的果枝虽然正在开花，可是下部已有十多个棉桃，很快就可以吐出白絮；麦后播种的一千多亩晚秋作物也都锄过最后一遍了。社员们挺胸扬眉，特别高兴，都准备歇几天伏，迎接丰收。
    社务管理委员会的全体干部，认为经过春、夏两季的努力，争来了现在的好庄稼，这是执行河北省委超额增产指示最有利的基础。只要加强作物的后期管理，对晚秋作物再追施一次肥，加上秋收组织的好，超过计划是有绝对把握的。干部们耐心地研究了增产办法和精打细算以后，发现能比原计划多收八万斤粮食。他们自己也感到意外兴奋。社里的中共支部书记张振生说：“这就是对国家的贡献，这就是咱们的光荣。”这个光荣的超额增产计划得到很多社员的支持，可是也有人认为行不通。有些社员认为今年的人力，地力都使尽了，庄稼长的够好了，无法再超额增产。也有的说：“立了秋挂锄钩，这是祖辈传流的老规矩，别白费劲了，应该休息休息准备收秋。”针对这些思想，社里召开了全社超额增产动员大会，经过社干部用增产爱国的道理和具体算账的办法向全体社员详细解释：全社三百多亩棉田只要每棵多保住一个棉桃，就能比原计划多收籽棉六千八百八十多斤；一千多亩麦茬玉米，如果及时除治各种虫害，重点进行人工辅助授粉和追施肥料，保证棒大粒满，每亩可以多收二十多斤，用提蔓、松土、培土，追加肥料等办法可以提高二百多亩甘薯的单位面积产量，以上各项总计就能超额增产折谷四万六千多斤。根据去年经验，如果做到了精收、细打，保证颗粒还家，这笔收入也能够达到四万多斤。仅九百亩花生，如果在收获后再普遍拾一次，最少能多收两万七千多斤。这个有根据、有办法的超额增产计划，鼓舞了全体社员的增产情绪。李金桌说：“别歇伏了，干吧！能多收八万斤粮食，也算对得起国家派拖拉机给咱们的帮助了。”芦墨林说：“可见地力没尽，就看人有没有办法。”
      在“为多收八万斤粮食而斗争”的口号下，全社男女老幼一齐动员起来，各队零星的副业活动暂时停止了，各生产队分别组成了十一个棉花整枝保桃大队，加紧进行棉花整枝摘心工作。三百多亩棉花地里，每天都有三百多人活动，即便遇上细雨的天气，人们也不休息。为了使棉棵下部通风，减少落铃，他们随手打去下部的老叶。棉花整枝工作做的最出色的，要算各队的一百多个老年和壮年妇女。她们大多没有娃娃累手，棉花从出土到开花结铃，一直没有离开过她们的手。第一生产队的女队长、共产党员徐树宽，为了提前完成棉花整枝任务，带动全队妇女连续好几个中午不歇晌，她们的腿疼了，腰酸了，就带着小板凳或破皮片在垅间坐着、跪着整枝。没有一个人喊过累叫过苦。女社员陈全说：
  “这会吃点苦，秋后多收花，卖给国家光荣，自己穿着方便。”那么多双手不停地工作，三百多亩棉花的第六次整枝工作，按计划在八月十六日完成了。棉花的落铃率由整枝前的百分之五十以上，降到百分之三十左右。
    各队在晚玉米普遍追过粗肥的基础上，特别又给生长较弱的一百多亩地用了一千三百多斤肥田粉。经过检查，又发现有些晚玉米有钻心虫。在各队技术员的指导下，青年社员们用壶盛着药水一棵一棵地灌治。第七队因为青年团员们发挥了高度的工作效率，把八十多亩晚玉米最先按规定标准在吐穗前灌治完了。为了帮助晚玉米授粉，队员们在农场技术员的帮助下，创造了借用治虫喷粉器吹出来的风力帮助玉米授粉，大大提高了工作效率。
      “消灭地边的空白地”是社员们在竞赛中提出的口号。据初步统计，仅地头、地边、井台等点片空地，点种蔓菁约合八、九亩，每亩最低能收两千斤。
    全体社员不仅争取今年能超额增产，同时也为着打下明年增产的基础开展了热烈的积肥竞赛。八月八日，全社举行了“义务除草日”，要求“每人一筐草”。当天，参加除草的四百多人，都超过了这个要求，平均每人缴草四十七筐。社员李耕须一个人就缴了青草一百四十九筐。全社计划趁草多、天热的季节，利用五十个公共猪圈和六十八个私人猪圈、厕所，用高温沤肥法，到十月份积肥七百六十万斤，供秋耕和种麦施用。
