Xinhua News Agency, London, July 31st: The British "Daily Herald" published an editorial condemning Syngman Rhee's warmongering speech delivered to the United States Congress on July 28th. The "Daily Herald" said: "Syngman Rhee is advocating for a renewed war when his own country is still full of holes. And he doesn't stop there. He casually talks about a world war."
    "These are insane ravings. Even those who are usually fond of making warmongering remarks are shocked by these words. ... This is a definite warning to other countries with troops stationed in Korea: they must take the firmest action to restrain this deadly President Rhee."
    The "Yorkshire Post" published an editorial entitled "This Man is a Bloodthirsty Man," saying that Syngman Rhee is attempting to provoke a third world war.
    The "Edinburgh Scotsman" rebuked Syngman Rhee for "inciting war" in an editorial. Both newspapers expressed regret that the United States allowed Syngman Rhee to deliver such a warmongering speech in Congress.

    英报斥责李承晚的好战叫嚣
    【新华社三十一日讯】伦敦消息：英国“每日先驱报”发表社论谴责李承晚七月二十八日在美国国会发表的好战演说。“每日先驱报”说：“李承晚在他自己的国家还是百孔千疮的时候鼓吹重新发动战争。他还不止于此。他轻松地谈论着世界大战。
    “这些都是丧心病狂的呓语。甚至那些一向爱发表好战言论的人们对这些话也感到震惊。……这对有军队驻在朝鲜的其他国家是一个肯定的警告：它们必须采取最坚定的行动来约束这个要命的李总统。”
    “约克郡邮报”发表了一篇题目是“这个人是一个嗜血者”的社论，说李承晚企图引起第三次世界大战。
    “爱丁堡苏格兰人报”在社论中斥责李承晚“煽动战争”。这两份报纸都对于美国让李承晚在国会发表这种好战演说表示遗憾。
