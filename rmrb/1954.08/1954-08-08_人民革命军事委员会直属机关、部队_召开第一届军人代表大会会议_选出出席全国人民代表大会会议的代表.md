Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The directly subordinate organs and troops of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission held the first meeting of their first military representative conference in late July. A total of one hundred and thirty-four representatives attended. The meeting heard a report from the election committee of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission's directly subordinate organs and troops regarding the election situation, discussed the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, and elected representatives to attend the National People's Congress meeting, the Beijing Municipal People's Congress meeting, and the Hebei Provincial People's Congress meeting.

The report from the election committee of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission's directly subordinate organs and troops pointed out that 99.85% of the voters in the directly subordinate organs and troops participated in the primary-level elections, exercising their sacred rights. Furthermore, through this political activity, the will and political enthusiasm of the personnel in the organs and troops to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction have been greatly enhanced.

The meeting, through secret ballot, elected Xu Xiangqian, Fu Zhong, Ding Zhihui (female), Wang Zhen, and Xu Guangda as the five representatives to attend the National People's Congress meeting. The meeting also elected three representatives to attend the Beijing Municipal People's Congress meeting and one representative to attend the Hebei Provincial People's Congress meeting.

Representative Fu Zhong delivered a speech at the meeting upon being elected. He stated that he would do his utmost to repay the trust of the voters. He said, we must serve the people better, strictly abide by all the laws and decrees of the country, maintain close ties with the masses of the people, accept the supervision of the masses of the people, carry forward the glorious tradition of unity between the army and the people, serve the people forever, be loyal to our great motherland, and strive for the liberation of our country's territory of Taiwan.

All the representatives attending the meeting seriously discussed the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and passed a resolution supporting the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China.

Finally, Xiao Hua, representing the entire People's Liberation Army election committee, congratulated the elected representatives. He said that the People's Liberation Army shoulders the important task of defending the motherland, and at the same time, it elects its own representatives to participate in people's congress meetings at the county and city levels or above, exercise democratic rights, and participate in national power construction. This is something we should feel honored about.
