To Comrade Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

    On the occasion of the 27th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I, on behalf of the Vietnamese People's Army and in my own name, extend to you, Comrade General, and to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, my warmest congratulations.

    Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and under your leadership, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has achieved many great victories in the Chinese Liberation War and in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and has become a powerful modern army charged with the task of defending Chinese territory and peace in Asia and the world.

    Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese People's Army must learn from the valuable experience of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, actively strengthen its forces, and resolutely complete its task of guaranteeing and consolidating peace in Vietnam and assisting in safeguarding peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

    I wish you, Comrade General, good health.

    And wish the Chinese People's Liberation Army greater strength and further victories.

                                                  General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army (signed)

Telegram from the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and forwarded to all comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

    On the eve of the glorious "August 1st" Army Day, we, on behalf of the youth of the whole country and all members of the Youth League, extend our warm congratulations and high respect to you – the heroic and invincible Chinese People's Liberation Army!

    You are the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, you defeated the armies of domestic and foreign reactionaries, liberated the Chinese mainland, and paved the way for the Chinese people to build socialism with blood and lives.

    You are the most beloved sons and daughters of the Chinese people. The 25,000-li Long March, the 6,000-meter-high Tibetan plateau, and the fierce enemy fire have never stopped your advancing footsteps. Your heroic spirit has set the highest example for us to serve the people wholeheartedly.

    With you, we work happily during the day and sleep peacefully at night. The Chinese people have a life of peace and freedom, the construction of socialism is guaranteed, and the youth have a happy future and all good hopes. The people of the whole country, the youth of the whole country, wholeheartedly love you and thank you!

    The Chinese people love peace, and the people of Asia and the world also yearn for peace, but U.S. imperialism still occupies Taiwan, turning it into their colony and a military base for further aggression against our country, and harassing and provoking us in every possible way, vainly attempting to threaten our peaceful construction and undermine peace in Asia. The Chinese people will never tolerate such domineering behavior. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and U.S. imperialism must get out!

    The people of the whole country have taken the task of liberating Taiwan upon their shoulders and handed this task over to you. You are the invincible people's army. In front of you, there are no enemies that cannot be defeated and no difficulties that cannot be overcome. We believe that you will surely crush the aggression of U.S. imperialism, eliminate the remaining bandits of Chiang Kai-shek, and finally liberate our Taiwan.

    Glorious comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: The people and youth of the whole country are stepping up the construction of the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation to support you in building a modern national defense army. The youth of the whole country must not only work hard to produce and ensure all the materials you need, but also be ready to respond to the call of the motherland to ensure your manpower needs. The youth of the whole country are your endless reserve force.

    We once again congratulate you on your continuous new achievements in building a modern national defense, and congratulate you on your continuous new victories in preparing to liberate Taiwan, defend the security of the motherland, and defend the peace of Asia and the world.

                                  Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League
                                  July 31, 1954

    在光荣的“八一”建军节前夕，我们代表全国青年和全体青年团员，向你们——英雄无敌的中国人民解放军，表示热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意！
    你们是中国人民优秀的子弟兵，你们在共产党和毛主席的领导下，战胜了国内外反动派的军队，解放了中国大陆，用鲜血和生命为中国人民开辟了建设社会主义的道路。
    你们是中国人民最可爱的儿女，二万五千里的长途，六千公尺的康藏高山，凶暴敌人的炮火，从没有挡住过你们前进的脚步。你们的英雄气概，为我们树立了忠心耿耿为人民服务的最高榜样。
    有了你们，我们白天劳动得愉快，夜里睡也睡得安稳，中国人民就有了和平自由的生活，社会主义的建设就有了保障，青年人就有了幸福前途和一切美好的希望。全国人民、全国青年衷心地热爱你们，感谢你们！
    中国人民热爱和平，亚洲人民和世界人民也渴望和平，但是美帝国主义却还霸占台湾。把那里变成他们的殖民地，变成进一步侵略我国的军事基地，并且骚扰、挑衅，无所不为，妄想威胁我国的和平建设，破坏亚洲的和平。中国人民决不能容忍这样横行霸道的行为。台湾是中国的领土，美帝国主义一定要滚出去！
    全国人民把解放台湾的任务担到了自己的肩上，也把这个任务交给了你们。你们是无敌的人民军队，在你们的面前，没有打不垮的敌人，没有克服不了的困难。我们相信，你们一定会粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，消灭蒋介石残余匪帮，最后解放我们的台湾。
    光荣的中国人民解放军同志们：全国人民和青年正在加紧进行国家的社会主义工业化的建设和社会主义改造的事业，来支援你们建设现代化的国防军。全国青年不仅要努力生产，保证你们一切需要的物资，而且时刻准备着响应祖国的召唤，来保证你们人力的需要。全中国青年是你们无穷无尽的后备力量。
    我们再一次祝贺你们在建设现代化国防事业中不断获得新的成就，祝贺你们在准备解放台湾，捍卫祖国安全和亚洲与世界和平的斗争中不断取得新的胜利。
