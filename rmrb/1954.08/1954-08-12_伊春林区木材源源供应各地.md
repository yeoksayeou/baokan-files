The renowned Yichun Forest Area in Heilongjiang Province sees hundreds of train cars fully loaded with various types of high-quality lumber departing daily for all parts of the country, supporting national construction. Last year, the lumber produced by the Yichun Forest Area accounted for one-quarter of the lumber production in Northeast China, and this year it will reach one-third. As the country's demand for lumber increases, production in the Yichun Forest Area is also developing rapidly. Using 1949 production as a base of 100, it increased to 732 in 1953, and this year it will increase to 1209. The lumber supplied to the country by the Yichun Forest Area in recent years, if used to build railways, could lay more than 30,000 kilometers of sleepers; if used to build houses, it could provide for the construction of more than 40,550,000 square meters of residential housing.

Lumber production in the Yichun Forest Area has gradually shifted from backward manual operations to mechanized operations. Tractors are now used extensively for timber gathering and transportation. The number of tractors has increased from dozens in 1950 to hundreds. This year, the volume of timber transported by tractors will increase nearly eight times compared to 1951, and the volume of timber gathered will increase 2.7 times. The main and branch lines of the forest railway will be extended to 263.9 kilometers this year. The Shuangzi River and Youhao forest railways, built in 1953 and leading to the depths of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, are now open to traffic for transporting timber. There are nearly 100 electric saws of various types, and more than ten "Marklin" and "Pais" power stations (mobile power stations). The Yichun Forest Area is increasingly adopting new technologies and equipment.

The red pine, which is now abundant in the Yichun Forest Area, is being continuously sent to various locations along the Tanglin Line. The lumber used in the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the new shafts of the Hegang Coal Mine, and the large-scale textile factory in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, all under construction, comes in part from the Yichun Forest Area. Shipbuilding materials for the Dalian Sino-Soviet Shipyard and rolling stock materials for the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory are also supplied by Yichun.

    伊春林区木材源源供应各地
    著名的黑龙江省伊春林区，每天都有数百辆车皮满载各种优质木材，运往全国各地，支援国家建设。伊春林区去年所产木材占东北木材产量的四分之一，今年将达三分之一。随着国家木材需要量的增长，伊春林区的生产也在飞速地发展着。如以一九四九年产量为一百，一九五三年增加到七百三十二，今年就增加到一千二百零九。伊春林区几年供给国家的木材，如果用于修建铁路，可铺设三万多公里枕木；如果用来修建房屋，可供四千零五十五万多平方公尺的住宅修建之用。
    伊春林区的木材生产已由落后的手工操作，逐步走向机械化作业。集材、运材已大部分使用拖拉机，拖拉机已由一九五○年的几十台增加到数百台，今年拖拉机的运材量将比一九五一年提高近八倍，集材量提高二点七倍。森林铁路的干支线今年将延长到二百六十三点九公里。一九五三年修建的通往小兴安岭深处的双子河、友好两条森林铁路，现在已经通车运材了。各种类型的电锯已近百台，
  “马克林”、“派斯”电站（流动电站）已达十余台。伊春林区正日益广泛地采用新的技术和设备。
    现在伊春林区盛产的红松，正沿着汤林线源源不断地送往各地。正在建设中的武汉长江大桥、鹤岗煤矿新建竖井以及北京东郊规模巨大的纺织工厂等工程所用的木材，其中就有来自伊春林区的。大连中苏造船厂的造船材，青岛四方机车车辆制造工厂的车辆材，也由伊春供应。
