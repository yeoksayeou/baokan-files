    CPI Calls on Indian People to Participate in Asian People's Solidarity Month
    (Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th) The Politburo of the Communist Party of India issued a statement on the 11th, warmly welcoming the call by the All-India Peace Council to designate September as Asian People's Solidarity Month.
    The statement said: "Following the recent historic talks between Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai, imperialist countries have intensified their efforts more than ever to continue suppressing the freedom of the Asian people. They are making frantic efforts to divide the Asian people and set them against each other by establishing the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and other military treaties and arrangements."
    The statement said that India has become a target of oppression and intimidation by imperialist countries. With the full help and support of its American masters in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Portuguese government is sending troops to its territories in India, rapidly establishing airports and bases, and shamelessly intimidating India. While fomenting further war hysteria against India, the US-Pakistan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" was signed, and the first batch of American military personnel and weapons were shipped to Pakistan.
    The statement pointed out: "Within India, some people have put forward insidious proposals to change India's foreign policy to support the US war policy. It is understood that some quite influential people in the government belong to the faction advocating following the United States."
    The statement emphasized: "Therefore, it is currently urgently needed for people from all walks of life in our country to unite against these sinister activities that endanger India's sovereignty, divide and suppress the Asian people, and lead the world to war." "Therefore, all patriotic people and those who advocate peace and freedom should respond to the All-India Peace Council's call to support the Five Principles in the Nehru-Zhou Enlai agreement and to support Asian solidarity, cooperation, and collective security."
    The statement concluded: "The Communist Party calls on all its members and supporters, as well as its affiliated units, to immediately take steps to make Asian People's Solidarity Month the largest demonstration for peace and national independence in India."

    印共号召印度人民参加亚洲人民团结月
    【新华社新德里十六日电】印度共产党政治局十一日发表声明，热烈欢迎全印和平理事会提出的以九月作为亚洲人民团结月的号召。
    声明说：“在尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理最近举行了富有历史意义的会谈之后，帝国主义国家已比以前任何时候都加紧努力，企图继续压制亚洲人民的自由。它们正在进行疯狂的努力，企图通过建立所谓东南亚公约组织和其他军事条约及安排来分裂亚洲人民，使他们互相为敌。”
    声明说，印度已成为帝国主义国家的压迫和恫吓的目标了。葡萄牙政府在北大西洋公约组织的美国主子的全力帮助和支持下，正在源源派遣军队到它在印度的属地去，迅速建立机场和基地，并无耻地威吓印度。在煽动对印度的进一步的战争歇斯底里的同时，美巴“共同防御援助协定”签订了，第一批美国军事人员和武器也运到了巴基斯坦。
    声明指出：“在印度国内，有些人提出了阴险的主张，要求改变印度的外交政策以支持美国的战争政策。据了解，政府人士中的一些相当有势力的人们也属于主张迫随美国之列。”
    声明强调说：“因此，目前迫切需要我国各阶层人民团结起来，反对这些危害印度的主权，分裂和镇压亚洲人民，并使全世界走向战争的阴险活动。”“因此，所有爱国的人们和主张和平与自由的人们都应该响应全印和平理事会关于支持尼赫鲁和周恩来协议中的五项原则以及支持亚洲团结、合作和集体安全的呼吁。”
    声明最后说：“共产党号召它的全体党员和拥护者以及它的所属单位，立刻采取步骤使亚洲人民团结月成为在印度的最大一次争取和平与民族独立的示威。”
