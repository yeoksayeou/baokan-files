　　The promotion and discussion activities regarding the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China are deepening among people from all walks of life in Shenyang and Harbin. According to recent statistics from Shenyang, over 820,000 people in the city have heard reports on the Draft Constitution and participated in discussions. As of August 2nd, the statistics from Harbin show 760,000 people.

　　Since the publication of the Draft Constitution, reporters, propagandists, and propaganda activists throughout Shenyang have repeatedly promoted the Draft Constitution to people from all walks of life. The majority of workers and staff in state-owned factories and basic construction departments have generally heard three to five reports on the Draft Constitution and have systematically discussed it two to four times. In Tiexi District, where factories are concentrated, 288 reporters have delivered 523 reports, reaching a total of over 106,000 people. The Harbin Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee and its sub-committees trained 15,000 reporters and propagandists, who, by mid-July, had conducted one to two rounds of reports in government offices, schools, factories, basic construction sites, enterprises, and neighborhoods. Over 150 broadcast machines and over 600 blackboards in factories, construction sites, cinemas, theaters, department stores, and cooperatives throughout the city were also used to promote the Draft Constitution and facilitate discussions. Individuals from universities, medical circles, industrial and commercial circles, ethnic minorities, and religious circles have all listened to reports and organized two to three rounds of discussions. During the discussions, the broad masses of people in Shenyang and Harbin seriously put forward many supplementary and revision opinions on the Draft Constitution.

　　During the promotion and discussion of the Draft Constitution, the broad masses of people have further strengthened their determination to strive for the construction of a socialist society. They have expressed their support for the Draft Constitution through practical actions in production. Many factories in state-owned and local state-owned enterprises throughout Shenyang have launched socialist labor competitions with technological innovation as the main content. In the labor competitions in June and July, the employees of the Shenyang Engineering Company of the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry proposed 103 rationalization proposals. The concept of completing plans has also been strengthened among the workers of various factories compared to the past, and many workers have exceeded their quotas. Pan Jingquan of the First Construction Engineering Company in Harbin created a scraping lathe, increasing work efficiency by four times. Li Ruizhao's group in the same company also completed the task of 813 door and window frames 16 days ahead of schedule with 266 work hours, ensuring quality. (Xinhua News Agency)
