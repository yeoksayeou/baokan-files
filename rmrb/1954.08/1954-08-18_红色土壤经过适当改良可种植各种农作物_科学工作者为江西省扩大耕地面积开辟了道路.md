With Proper Improvement, Red Soil Can Grow Various Crops
Scientific Workers Open Up Ways to Expand Cultivated Land Area in Jiangxi Province

    The red soil in the mountainous and hilly areas of Jiangxi Province, after more than four years of research and experimentation by agricultural scientific workers from the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute and the Soil Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has proven that as long as appropriate improvements are made, it can grow various crops. Agricultural scientific workers applied fixed amounts of mineral fertilizers, such as lime and phosphate rock powder, to more than 1,000 mu of red soil in Ganjiashan in Xinjian County, Henggang and Beigang in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, and nourished various crops through green manure and farmyard manure, all of which yielded good harvests. These crops include wheat, rye, sesame, rapeseed, peanuts, sweet potatoes, radish greens, seed melon, purple vetch, peaches, and loquat. In the past two or three years, farmers in various parts of Jiangxi Province, with the help of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute, have also widely planted Masson pines on this red soil, which are also growing well. The research results of scientific workers are of great significance for expanding the cultivated land area and increasing crop yields in Jiangxi Province. According to surveys, there are approximately more than 15 million mu of red soil hilly wasteland in central and southern Jiangxi Province and other places that can be cultivated under current conditions. If these red soil wastelands are cultivated after appropriate improvement, the cultivated land area in Jiangxi Province could be increased by about one-third.

    Scientific workers' research on this red soil in Jiangxi Province began in 1950. In recent years, they have successively investigated and studied the local farmers' utilization of this red soil and their experiences and lessons in Jiujiang, Fengcheng, Fuliang, Wuyuan and other places in Jiangxi Province, and also analyzed and tested the composition and fertilizer efficiency of this red soil. Through these works, they discovered the main reasons why this unimproved red soil cannot grow plants well. In the experiments on red soil improvement, scientific workers also used the method of mutual cooperation among agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. They used sweet potatoes, rye, pasture and other crops grown in red soil as feed to raise a large number of cattle, pigs, chickens and other poultry, creating the main fertilizer source for improving red soil. The Masson pines planted around it played a great role in regulating the local temperature and preventing natural disasters such as wind, drought, and floods. This method has opened up a way for the majority of farmers to make extensive use of red soil, expand cultivated land area, and increase crop yields under current conditions.

    红色土壤经过适当改良可种植各种农作物
    科学工作者为江西省扩大耕地面积开辟了道路
    江西省山地和丘陵地带的红色土壤，经江西省农业科学研究所和中国科学院土壤研究所的农业科学工作者四年多的研究试验，证明只要进行适当的改良，就可以种植各种农作物。农业科学工作者在江西省新建县的甘家山、南昌县的横岗、北岗等地的一千多亩红色土壤上，施用定量的矿质肥料，如石灰和磷灰石粉等，通过绿肥和厩肥来营养各种作物，都得到很好的收成。这些作物中有小麦、黑麦、芝麻、油菜、花生、红薯、萝卜菜、籽瓜、苕子、桃子、枇杷等。江西省各地农民在最近两、三年内，在江西省人民政府农林厅和江西省农业科学研究所帮助下，还在这种红色土壤上普遍的种植了马尾松，也生长得很好。科学工作者的研究成果对扩大江西省的耕地面积和增加农作物产量有重要意义。据调查，江西省中南部以及其他一些地方在目前条件下可以耕种的红土丘陵荒地约一千五百多万亩。这些红土荒地经过适当改良后耕种，江西省的耕地面积就大约可以增加三分之一。
    科学工作者对江西省这种红色土壤的研究，是从一九五零年开始的。几年来，他们曾先后到江西省的九江、丰城、浮梁、婺源等地调查研究了当地农民们利用这种红色土壤的情况和经验教训，还对这种红色土壤所含成分和肥效进行了分析和试验。经过这些工作，他们发现了这种未经改良的红色土壤不能很好地生长植物的主要原因。科学工作者在进行红色土壤改良的实验中，还运用了农、林、牧三者互相配合的方法。他们利用红色土壤里种植的红薯、黑麦、牧草等做饲料，喂养了大批牛、猪、鸡等禽畜，创造了改良红色土壤的主要肥源；四周围种植的马尾松在调节当地气温和防止风、旱、涝等自然灾害方面起了很大作用。这种方法为广大农民在目前条件下大量利用红色土壤、扩大耕地面积以及增加农作物收获量开辟了道路。
