    Workers in Shanghai, Anshan Iron and Steel, and Other Places Inspired, Labor Enthusiasm Soars

    The propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has inspired the Shanghai workers' enthusiasm for building a socialist society. In the past month, encouraging production reports have been continuously coming from various factories.
    Since late June, 950,000 workers in Shanghai have participated in three to four discussions of the Draft Constitution. Some factory workers have also listened to auxiliary reports made by combat heroes, labor models, and family members of revolutionary martyrs. In the workshops of many factories, along with the large red banners with slogans such as "Support the Draft Constitution," are slogans such as "Carry out technical innovation movement" and "Abide by labor discipline." Factory wall newspapers, which were previously filled with articles by workers supporting the Draft Constitution, are now filled with many guarantee letters from workshops and production teams, guaranteeing to complete and overfulfill the state's production plan by various methods. Sheng Li, a Shanghai municipal industrial labor model and lathe worker at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, modified the original fixture to a "spring fixture" when making the "sprocket" of the external grinder in July, increasing efficiency by more than three times and successfully completing the task two months and three days ahead of schedule. Wu Dehua, Wang Yipin, and Wu Chaonian, workers in the copper workshop of the Shanghai Shipbuilding and Repair Plant, improved the "fixture" for copying "wind buckets," increasing work efficiency by 30 percent. They believe that to build a socialist society, they must constantly work with a spirit of innovation. Workers at the State-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Textile Factory put forward 252 rationalization proposals in July and the first 20 days of August, exceeding the total number of rationalization proposals in the factory in the entire year of 1953 by one time. Employees in ten workshops of the Shanghai Boiler Factory submitted guarantee letters to the Party Committee, trade union, and factory director, promising to consciously abide by labor discipline; most teams have re-revised their patriotic covenants. The workers proposed to support the Draft Constitution with practical actions that do not waste a minute of production time. In the first half of August, the attendance rate of workers in this factory reached 95.5 percent.
    When the discussion of the Draft Constitution reached a climax, the Shanghai Private Fufeng Flour Mill received an emergency task from the State-owned China Grain Company Shanghai Branch to dry high-moisture rice. Most of the workers in this factory are from Anhui Province. In the discussion, they talked about how their hometowns were hit by floods this year, and how the Party and the government not only led the people to rescue and provide disaster relief, but also used airplanes and ships to transport food, tents, etc. to solve the food and accommodation problems of the victims, and sent medical personnel to treat the victims; some old workers recalled the tragic experience of their families being destroyed in the 1931 flood, and realized even more the benefits given to everyone by the People's Government. They expressed that rescuing one more bag of rice is contributing more to socialism, which is a practical action to support the Draft Constitution. The workers who packaged the rice used their brains to adjust the labor organization and improve the working methods, and soon broke through the targets. The rice-drying workers speeded up the screening of the rice and enlarged the pulley of the rice-transporting machine, accelerating the rice-transporting efficiency. The workers in this factory dried 3.41 million catties of rice more for the country in two weeks.

    The staff and workers of the various workshops led by the Chief Mechanical Engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have raised their socialist consciousness in the propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and a new atmosphere has emerged in production.
    After the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, the staff and workers of the workshops generally listened to five reports and conducted heated discussions in groups. Many workers raised their awareness in the discussion and applied to join the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League. Thirteen workers in the special-shaped casting workshop requested to join the Party, and eight young people requested to join the League.
    The propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution greatly promoted the labor competition with technical innovation as the main content. The forging team of the Second Machine Repair Workshop improved eight kinds of tools in just ten days in late July during the discussion of the Draft Constitution. Fitter Shen Chengxiao improved the tapping tool, increasing work efficiency by nearly four times. Old fitter Cao Yuanfang said in the discussion that in order to thank the state for its care for the old workers, he would make more contributions to socialist industrial construction. In accordance with his determination, he finally changed the heavy and slow working method of manually grinding parts to automatic mechanical grinding, increasing work efficiency by eight times and ensuring the completion of the emergency production task of a certain blast furnace waste gas switch. After discussing the Draft Constitution, young miller Cui Chengfu decided to learn from Wang Chonglun's spirit of technical innovation to accelerate socialist industrialization. Recently, he created a "drilling die" in making air hammer parts, which increased work efficiency by one and a half times.
    After in-depth propaganda and discussion, many examples of socialist conscious labor have emerged among the staff and workers. Young fitter Liu Yuxin estimated 75 hours for a certain job, but he took the initiative to propose to the leadership to shorten the working hours, and completed the task in only 20 hours. When the fitter team of the mechanical repair engineering workshop was discussing the Draft Constitution, they happened to have no work to do for a while, so they took the initiative to repair ten discarded oil presses, which not only solved the needs of repairing a certain blast furnace in advance, but also overcame the phenomenon of idling. In the discussion of the Draft Constitution, the workers' awareness of cherishing state property has also been strengthened. Many workers automatically think of ways to save and cherish state property. Outside the workshop of the special-shaped casting workshop, there has been a large pile of waste sand mixed with tiny copper slag since 1952. But in the past, it did not attract the attention of the workers. After studying the Draft Constitution, the workers brought water ladles and sieves from their homes and used their spare time to sift out more than two tons of copper from the pile of waste sand.

    上海、鞍钢等地工人受了鼓舞劳动热情高涨
    中华人民共和国宪法草案的宣传和讨论，鼓舞了上海工人建设社会主义社会的劳动热情。一月多来，各厂不断传出鼓舞人心的生产捷报。
    从六月下旬起，上海市已有九十五万工人参加过三次到四次宪法草案的讨论，有些工厂的工人还听过战斗英雄、劳动模范和革命烈士家属所做的辅导报告。许多工厂的车间里，和“拥护宪法草案”的大红横幅标语一起挂着的是“开展技术革新运动”、“遵守劳动纪律”等标语。前些时候曾经贴满了工人们拥护宪法草案的文章的工厂墙报上，现在又贴上了许多车间和生产小组的保证书，保证用各种办法完成和超额完成国家的生产计划。上海市工业劳动模范、上海机床厂车床工人盛利七月份在作外围磨床的“链轮”时，把原有的夹具改为“弹簧夹具”，效率提高三倍以上，胜利地完成了两个月零三天的任务。上海船舶修造厂铜工车间工人吴德华、王益品、吴潮年改进了拷“风斗”的“夹具”，工作效率提高了百分之三十。他们认为要建设社会主义社会，必须不断以革新精神来进行工作。国营上海第十七棉纺织厂工人在七月份和八月的前二十天内，就提出了合理化建议二百五十二条，超过了这个厂一九五三年全年的合理化建议总数一倍。上海锅炉厂十个车间的职工并向党委会、工会、厂长提出了自觉遵守劳动纪律的保证书；大部分小组都重新修订了爱国公约。工人们提出要以不浪费
  一分钟生产时间的实际行动来拥护宪法草案。八月份上半月，这个厂工人的出勤率已达到百分之九十五点五。
    上海私营阜丰面粉厂工人在讨论宪法草案进入高潮时，厂里接到国营中国粮食公司上海市公司交给的烘干高水份稻谷的突击任务。这个工厂的工人大半都是安徽省人，他们在讨论中谈到自己家乡今年遭到水灾，党和政府不但领导人民救灾抢险，还用飞机、轮船运送粮食、帐篷等解决灾民的食宿问题，派出医务人员给灾民治病等；有些老工人联想起一九三一年水灾时家破人亡的惨痛遭遇，越加体会到人民政府给予大家的好处。他们纷纷表示多抢救一包稻子，就是多为社会主义出份力量，就是拥护宪法草案的实际行动。包装稻谷的工人开动脑筋，调整了劳动组织，改进了工作方法，很快就突破了指标。烘稻工人加快筛稻，又将运稻机轮盘放大，加速了运稻效率，这个厂的工人在两个星期内就替国家多烘了三百四十一万斤稻谷。

    鞍山钢铁公司总机械师所领导的各车间职工在中华人民共和国宪法草案的宣传和讨论中，提高了社会主义觉悟，生产上出现了新气象。
    宪法草案公布后，各车间职工普遍听了五次报告，并以小组为单位进行了热烈讨论。不少工人在讨论中提高了觉悟，纷纷申请参加中国共产党和青年团，异型铸造车间有十三名工人要求入党，八名青年要求入团。
    宪法草案的宣传和讨论，大大推动了以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛。第二机修车间锻工组在宪法草案的讨论中，仅七月下旬十天内就改进了八种工具。钳工沈成孝，改进了掏眼工具，提高工作效率将近四倍。老钳工曹远芳在讨论中表示，为了感谢国家对老工人的关怀，要在社会主义工业建设中作更多的贡献。他按照自己的决心，终于把用手研磨部件的笨重缓慢的工作方法改变为用机械自动研磨，提高工作效率八倍，保证了某号高炉废气开闭器紧急制作任务的完成。青年铣工崔成福在讨论宪法草案后，决心要学习王崇伦的技术革新精神，加速社会主义工业化。最近他在做空气锤零件中，创造了一个“钻模胎”，提高了工作效率一倍半。
    经过深入宣传和讨论，在职工中出现了许多社会主义自觉劳动的范例。青年钳工刘玉新在做某件活时，估工为七十五小时，而他自己主动向领导方面提出缩短工时，只用二十小时就完成了任务。机械修理工程车间钳工组，在进行宪法草案讨论时，正赶上一时没有工作做，他们便主动地修理好十台已经废弃的压油机，这样既预先解决了检修某号高炉的需要，又克服了窝工现象。在宪法草案讨论中，工人们爱护国家财产的观念也加强了。许多工人自动想办法节约和爱护国家财产。在异型铸造车间场房外边，自一九五二年就有一大堆掺杂着微小铜渣的废砂堆在那里。但过去没有引起工人的注意。工人们学习宪法草案后，就带来自己家里的水瓢和筛子，利用业余时间从这堆废砂里淘筛出两吨多铜。　（新华社）
