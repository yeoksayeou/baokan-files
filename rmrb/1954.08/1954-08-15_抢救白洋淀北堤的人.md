    People Rescuing the Northern Embankment of Baiyangdian
    Zhou Weixiong

    The water level of Baiyangdian continued to rise, and the water surface on the north side was only a few decimeters away from the top of the embankment. The three counties north of the Baiyangdian Lake – Rongcheng, Xiongxian, and Anxin in Hebei Province – organized rescue teams to defend their respective sections of the embankment, determined not to let the flood break through the embankment.
    On the morning of July 21st, it was raining. Suddenly, a southwest wind brought waves more than two feet high, crashing against the embankment. In the section defended by Rongcheng County, more than 1,300 meters of the embankment top were submerged in the waves, appearing and disappearing intermittently. The wind and waves grew stronger, and two breaches appeared on the embankment. The water from the lake merged with the waist-deep waterlogged area outside the embankment. At this critical moment, the materials nearby had been washed away by the flood, and there was no time to transport materials from further away. Wang Jinkai, the head of the Agricultural Construction Section of the County People's Government, and five others immediately lay down to block one breach, while Shen Jirui, the secretary of the Party Branch in the same village, led eight or nine people to block the other breach with their bodies. The water crashed over them, making it impossible to open their eyes or breathe. After one wave passed, they wiped the water from their heads, took a breath, and prepared to defend against the arrival of the second wave. At this extremely urgent moment, the Xiongxian County laborers defending another section of the embankment immediately organized more than a hundred people, carrying reed mats to provide reinforcement. The women from Nanxinzhuang Village in Xiongxian County, who lived under the embankment, also brought out the mats used for their kang beds at home and sent them to the laborers for protection. With their support, after an hour of heroic struggle, the Rongcheng County section of the embankment finally overcame the great wind and waves.
    After the wind and waves subsided, the more than 1,300 meters of embankment in Rongcheng County were eroded from the original width of more than four feet to only a little over one foot. Countless deep gullies were washed out of the outer slope, and water was seeping out everywhere. The laborers immediately began to repair the eroded embankment, but with water on both sides of the embankment, it was necessary to take soil from the bottom of the half-person-deep water and transport it to the embankment by boat. With few boats and insufficient manpower, it was very difficult to complete this quickly. The news reached the two townships of Guolikou and Wangjiazhai in Anxin County, which were located inside the embankment. They quickly organized 120 people, rowing forty small boats to the northern embankment of Anxin to help with the repairs. As a result, it only took a day and a half to completely repair the damaged section of the embankment. In celebrating the victory of this struggle, the farmers excitedly discussed: In the past, people inside the embankment always hoped that the embankment would break, so that their houses would not be flooded; people defending the embankment also hoped that a breach would occur elsewhere to reduce their own danger, and blood had been shed in many places because of this. Today, under the education and leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we understand that small interests must give way to larger interests. Only if the crops outside the embankment are harvested can the people in the lake have food to eat. Only by protecting the entire embankment can we achieve a comprehensive harvest.

    抢救白洋淀北堤的人
    周维雄
    白洋淀的水位不断上涨，北边的水面离堤顶只有几公寸了。淀北面三个县——河北省的容城、雄县和安新，都组织了抢险队防守着各自的堤段，决心不让洪水冲破堤防。
    七月二十一日早晨，雨正在下着，忽然西南风夹着二尺多高的浪头向堤岸冲来，容城县防守的堤段，有一千三百多公尺堤顶被埋在浪水里，忽隐忽现。风浪越来越大，堤上出现了两处缺口，淀水和齐腰深的堤外渍水会合了。这时，附近的物料已被洪水冲跑，到远处搬运又来不及，县人民政府农建科科长王金楷等六人立即躺下堵住一处缺口，留同乡党总支书记沈吉瑞带领八、九个人用身子堵住另一缺口。水从他们身上打过去，睁不开眼睛，出不来气，一个浪头过去，他们抹一抹头上的水，换一口气，再防御着第二个浪头的到来。在这万分紧急的时候，防守在另一堤段的雄县民工，马上组织一百多人，带着苇席跑来增援。住在堤下的雄县南辛庄村的妇女，也都将家里铺炕的席子抱出来送给民工护险。在他们支援下，经过一小时的英勇搏斗，容城县的堤段终于战胜了大风浪。
    风浪过后，容城县一千三百多公尺的堤岸，从原来四尺多宽的堤顶冲刷得只剩一尺多宽。外坡也冲出无数深沟，普遍向外冒水。民工们又立即开始修补被冲刷的堤防，但是两水夹堤，要从半人深的水底取土，再用船运到堤上，在船只少人力不足的情况下，要想很快完成非常困难。消息传到了住在堤里面安新县的郭里口和王家寨两个乡，他们很快就组织了一百二十个人，撑着四十只小船来到安新北堤，帮助抢修。结果只用一天半的时间，便全部修好了被冲坏的堤段。在庆贺这次斗争胜利时，农民们兴奋地谈论着：过去堤内的人总是盼着堤开口子，好使自己的房子不受泡；防险的人也希望别处决口，减轻自己的险情，很多地方并因此流过血。今天在共产党和人民政府的教育和领导下，我们懂得了小利要服从大利，只有堤外收了粮食，淀里的人才有饭吃，只有保守住整个堤防，才能获得全面的丰收。
