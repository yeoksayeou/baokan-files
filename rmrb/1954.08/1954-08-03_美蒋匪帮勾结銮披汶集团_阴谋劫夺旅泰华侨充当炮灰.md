Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 31st:

    The United States is directly arranging further military collusion between the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Taiwan and the Luang Phibuns group in Thailand, plotting to forcibly conscript overseas Chinese residing in Thailand as cannon fodder.

    One of the contents of the conspiracy of the U.S. Ambassador to Thailand and special agent head Donovan, who recently arrived in Taiwan from Bangkok, is to plan for the Chiang Kai-shek gang and the Luang Phibuns group to forcibly conscript overseas Chinese in Thailand as cannon fodder. There are reports that Donovan's visit to Taiwan is related to Thailand's plan to organize a 50,000-strong "Overseas Chinese Self-Defense Force." Everyone remembers that Luang Phibuns once publicly stated that he intended to use overseas Chinese in Thailand as a "source of troops." Prior to this, the Chiang Kai-shek gang had already sent two special agents to Thailand on July 19th to investigate the situation of overseas Chinese. Yun Zhuting, a member of the Chiang Kai-shek gang residing in Thailand, also arrived in Taiwan on the 29th, following Donovan. According to the Associated Press, Yun Zhuting will secretly plan with the Taiwan bandits to establish a so-called "China-Thailand Joint Relief Committee" in order to use the name of "assistance" to kidnap and persecute overseas Chinese in Thailand. Furthermore, the Bangkok correspondent of the Burmese English newspaper "Nation" revealed on the 24th that in Bangkok, two groups controlled by American special agents and members of the Chiang Kai-shek gang have decided to use the $600,000 extorted from overseas Chinese to purchase weapons, ammunition, medicines, and uniforms for the remnant troops of the Chiang Kai-shek gang who are intruding into the Burmese border.

    In order to further collude the Taiwan bandits and the Luang Phibuns group, the United States is instructing the Thai authorities to send a military delegation to Taiwan. The candidates for the delegation have already been decided and will be Thai military officers who have worked closely with members of the Chiang Kai-shek gang in the deceptive withdrawal of some of the remnant troops of the Chiang Kai-shek gang who intruded into the Burmese border. Donovan's arrival in Taiwan before the Thai military delegation departs is by no means accidental.

    This military adventure plan of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and the Luang Phibuns group, which sacrifices overseas Chinese in Thailand, has aroused serious attention from relevant parties here.

### 美蒋匪帮勾结銮披汶集团  阴谋劫夺旅泰华侨充当炮灰

    美蒋匪帮勾结銮披汶集团
    阴谋劫夺旅泰华侨充当炮灰
        【新华社三十一日北京讯】美国正在直接安排台湾蒋介石匪帮和泰国銮披汶集团在军事上的进一步勾结，阴谋强征旅居泰国的华侨充当炮灰。
    最近从曼谷到达台湾的美国驻泰国大使、特务头子杜诺万的阴谋活动的内容之一就是：策划由蒋介石匪帮和銮披汶集团一起去强征泰国华侨作炮灰。有消息说，杜诺万到台湾是和泰国要组织一支五万人的“华侨自卫队”有关的。大家记得，銮披汶曾公开表示过，他打算把泰国华侨作为“兵力的来源”。在这以前，蒋介石匪帮已经在七月十九日派遣两个特务分子到泰国去调查华侨情况。居留泰国的蒋介石匪帮分子云竹亭也跟随杜诺万之后在二十九日到达台湾。据合众社透露，云竹亭将和台匪密谋成立所谓“中泰联合救济委员会”，以便利用
  “援助”的名义劫持和迫害泰国华侨。又据缅甸英文报纸“民族报”驻曼谷的记者二十四日揭露，在曼谷，两个由美国特务和蒋介石匪帮分子操纵的团体已经决定把向华侨勒索得来的六十万美元，用来购买武器、弹药、药品和制服供给窜扰缅甸国境的蒋介石匪帮残余部队。
      为了使台匪和銮披汶集团进一步勾结，美国正在指使泰国当局派遣一个军事代表团前往台湾，代表团人选已经决定由那些曾经在从事欺骗性的撤出一部分窜扰缅甸国境蒋介石匪帮残余部队的活动中和蒋介石匪帮分子密切合作过的泰国军官担任。杜诺万在泰国军事代表团将要出发之前到达台湾，这绝不是偶然的。
    美国、蒋介石匪帮和銮披汶集团这种狼狈为奸、以泰国华侨为牺牲的军事冒险计划，已引起此间有关方面的严重注意。
