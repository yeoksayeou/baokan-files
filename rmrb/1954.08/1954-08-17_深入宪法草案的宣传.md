Deepen the Propaganda of the Draft Constitution

The formulation of the Constitution is an extremely important political event for our country. With the promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the unfolding of nationwide discussions on the Draft Constitution, newspapers in various regions have generally carried out timely and prominent propaganda about the Draft Constitution. Some newspapers have published propaganda essays or popular explanatory articles, systematically explaining the basic spirit and main contents of the Draft Constitution. Some newspapers have continuously and extensively reported the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life for the Draft Constitution, and have initially reflected the political enthusiasm and high labor enthusiasm shown by the broad masses in the discussion of the Draft Constitution. Some newspapers have also been able to link with the actual local life to explain some basic contents of the Draft Constitution in a relatively concrete manner. These efforts made by the newspapers have played a considerable role in promoting the people to actively participate in the discussion of the Draft Constitution. However, on the other hand, the propaganda of many newspapers on the Draft Constitution is not deep enough, and there are varying degrees of generalization in both explaining the contents of the Draft Constitution and reflecting the propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution. At present, many areas have entered or are entering the stage of chapter-by-chapter and article-by-article discussion. Our newspapers need to closely integrate with the progress of actual work and promptly shift their propaganda reports to in-depth reporting.

To deepen the propaganda of the Draft Constitution, we should first further publicize the basic content and spirit of the Draft Constitution. After the previous period of propaganda and discussion, the broad masses have a preliminary understanding of the Draft Constitution, but it must be seen that some people's understanding is not very profound. Some people have doubts about certain clauses in their minds, and some people understand the spirit of the clauses only from the perspective of their own interests. Therefore, newspapers should not only continue to profoundly explain the basic content and spirit of the Draft Constitution in theory, but especially need to combine with local practical work and mass thinking, to explain and interpret vividly and specifically in a planned and purposeful way, so as to help the people more thoroughly understand the Draft Constitution and its close relationship with them. For example, regarding our country’s political system, we should combine it with the achievements of local work and the political experience already possessed by the masses to explain in a popular and concrete way how it embodies the basic principle that all power belongs to the people; explain how the people should exercise their power to participate in state management and national construction, and supervise the work of state organs; explain the superiority of our country's political system; explain how our people's democratic system guarantees that our country can finally build a socialist society through peaceful means. For another example, regarding the basic rights and obligations of citizens, we should also focus on the consistency of rights and obligations based on the personal experience of the masses, and the relationship between the rights and obligations of citizens and the construction of socialism; for the rights of citizens, we should not only connect the revolutionary achievements to publicize the material guarantees that have been obtained, but also explain that this material guarantee can only be gradually expanded, which requires the people of the whole country to actively participate in the socialist construction cause; for the basic obligations of citizens, we should especially conduct in-depth propaganda targeting the ideological problems among the masses, educating people to understand that fulfilling these obligations is related to their fundamental and long-term interests, and is the glorious duty of every citizen. In order to deepen the propaganda of the spirit and content of the Draft Constitution, some newspapers have recently adopted some effective methods. For example, the Tianjin Daily organized a special page promoting "All Power Belongs to the People." This special page not only used simple reasoning to explain the superiority of the people's congress system of democratic centralism implemented in our country, but also used facts familiar to the local people such as "the transformation of the Jinzhong River," and the personal experience of the people's representatives, to explain how the "seal of power" is in the hands of the people, and how the people's wishes have become a vivid reality. The Shanghai Liberation Daily also organized a special page on "Labor is the glorious thing for all citizens with labor ability." In coordination with this special page, an editorial was also published, which on the one hand elaborated the glorious principles of labor, and on the other hand criticized the views of some workers, peasants, and young students who despise labor and incorrect labor attitudes. Other newspapers such as Beijing Worker's Daily, Northeast Daily, Heilongjiang Daily, Shanxi Daily, etc. have also used special pages to conduct concentrated and powerful publicity on certain clauses of the Draft Constitution. Some newspapers such as Ta Kung Pao, Chongqing Daily, Tianjin Daily, etc. have also organized symposiums for different target groups such as workers, farmers, women, representatives of ethnic minorities, and people in the industrial and commercial circles, and used the experiences of the masses to educate the masses. Well-organized special pages and symposiums can produce more profound effects. The methods adopted by newspapers and other effective methods are obviously worth promoting.

To deepen the propaganda of the Draft Constitution, it not only requires newspapers to pay attention to combining with the actual local work and mass thinking in propaganda, but also requires newspapers to comprehensively grasp policies and correctly and completely explain the spirit and content of the Draft Constitution. Only in this way can newspapers truly help people improve their understanding and prevent some people from understanding the Draft Constitution only from the perspective of their own interests. However, some newspapers have had one-sided problems in the past propaganda. For example, some newspapers only paid attention to publicizing the revolutionary achievements affirmed by the Draft Constitution, but did not simultaneously emphasize the fundamental requirements of the country during the transition period reflected in the Draft Constitution and the common desire of the broad masses to build a socialist society. In some articles published by some industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai in the previous period supporting the Draft Constitution, there was little mention of how capitalists accept socialist transformation; some contributions and letters from employees of private enterprises published by this newspaper also rarely mentioned the issue of supervising capitalists' transformation. This cannot fully and completely express the essence of the spirit of the Draft Constitution and produce the educational effect it should have. Because the entire content of our Draft Constitution shows that this is a constitution for the transition period of striving for the construction of socialism, and a constitution that guarantees the gradual elimination of the system of exploitation and the establishment of a socialist society. If newspapers do not emphasize this fundamental point in their propaganda, they cannot effectively improve the people's socialist consciousness, and guide and encourage the people to strive for the construction of socialism. Some newspapers even made policy errors in their propaganda. For example, the "Right to Rest of Workers of the People's Republic of China" stipulated in the Draft Constitution was said to be "Everyone has the right to rest," and so on. It should be pointed out that newspapers must have a high degree of political seriousness in carrying out the propaganda of the Draft Constitution, and any deviations or errors in propaganda will affect the correct and comprehensive understanding of the Draft Constitution by the people. This is what newspapers must pay attention to and prevent in the future in-depth propaganda of the Draft Constitution.

The promulgation of the Draft Constitution has already aroused great repercussions among the people; with the deepening of the propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution, it will inevitably produce a wider and more profound impact. This will be manifested in the improvement of the socialist consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of the people, the strengthening of the concept of law and discipline, the further development and consolidation of the people's democratic consciousness and habits, and the further increase of political activism and labor enthusiasm. Newspapers cannot be satisfied with simply introducing the initial reactions of the broad masses to the Draft Constitution, nor can they stay at the stage of generally reporting how people recall comparisons and express their determination during the discussion process. Newspapers should fully report the enthusiastic participation of the people in the discussion of the Draft Constitution, and deeply explore the changes in people's hearts and actions caused by the discussion, and select typical facts to vividly reflect. This has a significant effect on mobilizing and organizing the masses to use practical actions to promote current work and realize the overall task of the country during the transition period. The Lüda People's Daily once described in a report how the production enthusiasm of the workers in the electric furnace section of the steel casting plant of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company was high after studying the Draft Constitution. For example, Xing Qianzhong, a seventh-grade worker who had participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation and was wounded three times, was extremely excited because the goal he had pursued in the past on the battlefield and today in the factory—the realization of socialism—was clearly stipulated in the Draft Constitution; in order to strive for the early realization of a happy socialist society, he did not want to let the phenomenon of no one being responsible for the steel tapping pit, resulting in waste of molten steel, continue to exist, and he took the initiative to propose that he be responsible for cleaning up the steel tapping pit in the future, and whenever there was debris in the pit, he always cleaned it up in time regardless of how hot the pit was. The Hebei Daily reported that many farmers in Cangxian County, encouraged by the Draft Constitution, actively paid agricultural taxes and sold surplus grain to the state. After discussion, the members of the Huangjiayao Village Agricultural Production Cooperative expressed that in order to build socialism, they would "exert as much effort as they could," and although the township government assigned them the task of purchasing 1,200 catties of wheat, they voluntarily sold 2,400 catties to the state. The examples reported by the newspapers are undoubtedly educational and encouraging. And such facts are very rich in real life. After the discussion of the Draft Constitution, not only have many new atmospheres appeared among the broad workers and peasants, but also among people of other social strata. Our newspapers must focus on and reflect these new atmospheres in a comprehensive, full, and profound way, and be good at organically combining this kind of reporting with the reporting of current work. In order to achieve this, not only does the editorial department need to break the erroneous view of some comrades that the reporting of political movements is old-fashioned and strive to go deep into reality and the masses; but also need to change the practice of some newspapers that completely separate the propaganda of the Draft Constitution from the propaganda of other current work. It must be understood that the discussion of the Draft Constitution is by no means carried out in isolation in real life, so it should not be carried out in isolation in terms of publicity and reporting.

In order to further do a good job in the propaganda of the Draft Constitution, the editorial department needs to conduct an inspection and summary of the propaganda situation in the previous stage, and strengthen the planning and organization of future work. That is to say, on the basis of carefully studying the actual work situation and the thinking of the masses, formulate a plan to deeply publicize the Draft Constitution, determine the focus and steps of the propaganda, and at the same time better organize the strength inside and outside the editorial department, especially relying on the strength of the broad masses of correspondents and activists, to implement their plans. To do all this well, the key lies in the fact that the Party committee must strengthen its political and ideological leadership over the editorial department, on the one hand, it must urge the editorial department to strengthen the study of the Draft Constitution to improve the level of understanding; on the other hand, it must help the editorial department to overcome and prevent temporary views and slack moods regarding the propaganda of the Draft Constitution. It should be seen that at present, the propaganda on the Draft Constitution in many areas is not deep or thorough enough and needs to be further carried out, and at the same time, the propaganda on the Draft Constitution has not yet entered a climax nationwide. This shows that our newspapers must not relax the propaganda on the Draft Constitution, on the contrary, it must make greater efforts to deepen this propaganda and further play the role of newspapers in mobilizing and organizing in the major political event of formulating the Constitution.

### 深入宪法草案的宣传

专栏：报纸工作述评

    深入宪法草案的宣传
    制定宪法是我们国家的一件极其重大的政治事件。随着中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布及全民对宪法草案讨论的开展，各地报纸一般都及时而突出地进行了关于宪法草案的宣传。有些报纸发表了宣传论文或通俗的解释性的文章，比较系统地说明了宪法草案的基本精神和主要内容。有些报纸连续地大量地报道了各界人民热烈拥护宪法草案的情况，并初步地反映了广大群众在宪法草案的讨论中所表现出来的政治热情和劳动积极性的高涨。有的报纸并能联系当地的实际生活，对宪法草案的某些基本内容进行比较具体的阐明。报纸所做的这些努力，对于推动人民群众积极参加宪法草案的讨论起了相当大的作用。但是另一方面，不少报纸关于宪法草案的宣传还是不够深入的，不论在解释宪法草案的内容方面或反映宪法草案的宣传和讨论情况方面，都有不同程度的一般化的缺点。目前不少地区已经或正在进入逐章逐条讨论阶段。我们的报纸有必要紧密结合着实际工作的进展，把自己的宣传报道及时转向深入。
    要深入宪法草案的宣传，首先就应当进一步宣传宪法草案的基本内容和精神。经过前一时期的宣传、讨论，广大群众对于宪法草案虽然有了初步的认识，但是必须看到，还有一部分人在认识上并不是很深刻的。有的人对其中的某些条文，在思想上存有疑问，有的人在领会条文的精神上，只从自己的利益的角度出发。因此，报纸不仅应当继续从理论上深刻地阐明宪法草案的基本内容和精神，尤其需要结合当地的实际工作和群众思想，有计划有目的地并且是生动具体地进行说明和解释，以便帮助人民群众更加透彻地了解宪法草案及其对自己的切身关系。例如，关于我们国家的政治制度，就应当结合当地的工作成就和群众已有的政治经验，通俗而具体地说明它怎样体现一切权力属于人民的基本原则；说明人民应当怎样行使自己的权力，来参加国家管理工作和国家建设事业，监督国家机关的工作；说明我国政治制度的优越性；说明我国的人民民主制度如何保证我国能够通过和平的道路最后建成社会主义社会。又如，关于公民的基本权利和义务，同样应当根据群众的切身体会，着重说明权利和义务的一致性，公民的权利和义务同建设社会主义的关系；对于公民的权利既要联系革命成果来宣传已得到的物质保证，又要说明这种物质保证只能是逐步扩大的，这就要依靠全国人民积极参加社会主义的建设事业；对于公民的基本义务，尤其要针对群众中的思想问题进行深入的宣传，教育人们懂得履行这些义务关系到他们的根本利益和长远利益，是每一个公民的光荣职责。为了深入宣传宪法草案的精神和内容，最近有些报纸采取了一些有效的办法。例如天津日报组织了宣传“一切权力属于人民”的专页。这个专页不仅用浅近的道理说明了我们国家实行民主集中制的人民代表大会制度的优越性，而且用当地人民所熟悉的“金钟河的变迁”等事实，用人民代表的亲身经历，说明了“印把子”怎样掌握在人民的手中，人民的意愿怎样变成了生动的现实。上海解放日报也曾组织了“劳动是一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣事情”的专页。配合着这个专页还发表了社论，一方面阐明了劳动光荣的道理，另一方面批判了部分工人、农民和青年学生中轻视劳动的观点和不正确的劳动态度。其他一些报纸如北京工人日报、东北日报、黑龙江日报、山西日报等也曾采用专页的方式，对宪法草案的某些条文进行了集中有力的宣传。有些报纸如大公报、重庆日报、天津日报等还分别组织工人、农民、妇女、少数民族代表、工商界人士等不同对象的座谈会，用群众自己的体会来教育群众。组织得好的专页和座谈会，都能产生较为深刻的效果。报纸所采用的这些办法以及其他有效的办法，显然都是值得推广的。
    深入宪法草案的宣传，不仅要求报纸在宣传中注意结合当地的实际工作和群众思想，而且要求报纸全面地掌握政策，正确地完整地说明宪法草案的精神和内容。只有这样，报纸才能真正帮助人们提高认识，并且防止某些人只从自己的利益的角度出发来了解宪法草案的偏向。但是过去有些报纸在宣传中却出现了片面性的毛病。例如，有的报纸只注意宣传宪法草案所肯定的革命成果，而没有同时强调宪法草案所反映的国家在过渡时期的根本要求和广大人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望。上海有一个报纸在前一时期发表的一些工商业者拥护宪法草案的文章中，就很少提到资本家如何接受社会主义改造的问题；这个报纸发表的一些私营企业职工的来稿来信中，也很少提及监督资本家改造的问题。这就不能充分地完整地表达出宪法草案的精神实质，并产生应有的教育作用。因为我们的宪法草案的全部内容表明，这是为建设社会主义而奋斗的过渡时期的宪法，是保证逐步消灭剥削制度、建立社会主义社会的宪法。报纸在宣传中不强调这一个根本之点，就不能有效地提高人民的社会主义觉悟，引导和鼓舞人民为建设社会主义而奋斗。有的报纸在宣传中甚至产生了政策性的错误。例如，将宪法草案中所规定的“中华人民共和国劳动者有休息的权利”说成“人人有休息权”，等等。应当指出，报纸进行宪法草案的宣传必须具有高度的政治严肃性，宣传上的任何偏差或错误，都将影响人民群众对于宪法草案的正确的全面的理解。这是报纸在今后深入宪法草案的宣传中必须注意和防止的。
    宪法草案的公布，已经在人民群众中引起了巨大的反响；随着宪法草案的宣传和讨论的深入开展，必然会产生更为广泛和深刻的影响。这将表现为人民群众社会主义觉悟和爱国热情的提高，守法观念和纪律观念的加强，人民民主意识和习惯的进一步发扬和巩固，政治积极性和劳动积极性的进一步高涨等。报纸既不能满足于仅仅介绍广大群众对于宪法草案的最初反应，也不能停留在一般地报道人们在讨论过程中如何回忆对比和表示态度决心的阶段上。报纸应当充分地报道人民群众踊跃参加宪法草案讨论的热烈情况，并深入发掘经过讨论在人们内心中和行动上所引起的变化，选择典型的事实加以生动的反映。这对于动员和组织群众用实际行动来推动当前工作和实现国家在过渡时期的总任务，有着重大的作用。旅大人民日报曾在一篇报道中描写了中苏造船公司铸钢厂电气炉工段工人们在学习宪法草案后生产情绪如何高涨。如七级工人邢乾忠是一个曾经参加抗日战争和解放战争并三次负伤的复员军人，他因自己过去在战场上和今天在工厂里所追求的目标——实现社会主义——在宪法草案中有了明文规定而异常兴奋；为了争取幸福的社会主义早日实现，他不愿再让出钢坑无人负责致使钢水浪费的现象继续存在，主动提出今后出钢坑由他负责收拾，每当出钢坑里有了乱渣，总是不顾坑里怎样烤人，及时把它收拾出来。河北日报曾报道了沧县许多农民在宪法草案的鼓舞下，积极缴纳农业税和出卖余粮给国家的情况。黄家窑村农业生产合作社社员们经过讨论，表示为了建设社会主义要“有多大力气掏多大力气”，虽然乡人民政府分配给他们计划收购小麦的任务是一千二百斤，他们却自愿卖给国家二千四百斤。报纸所报道的这些事例，无疑是富有教育意义和鼓舞力量的。而这样的事实在现实生活中是很丰富的。经过宪法草案的讨论，不仅在广大工人和农民中出现了许多新气象，就是在其他各阶层人民中也出现了许多新气象。我们的报纸正是要有重点而又多方面地，充分地而又深刻地反映出这些新气象，并善于把这方面的报道和当前工作的报道有机地结合起来。为要做到这一点，不仅需要编辑部打破某些同志认为政治运动报道老一套的错误观点，力求深入实际深入群众；而且需要改变某些报纸将宪法草案的宣传和其他当前工作的宣传完全割裂开来的做法。必须了解，在实际生活中宪法草案的讨论绝不是孤立进行的，因而在宣传报道方面也就不应孤立地进行。
    为了进一步做好宪法草案的宣传，编辑部有必要对前一阶段的宣传情况进行一次检查和总结，并加强今后工作的计划性和组织性。这就是要在认真研究实际工作情况和群众思想情况的基础上，制订出深入宣传宪法草案的计划，确定宣传的重点和步骤，同时更好地组织编辑部内外的力量，特别是依靠广大通讯员和作者积极分子的力量，来贯彻实现自己的计划。而要做好这一切工作，关键还在于党委必须加强对编辑部的政治思想领导，一方面要督促编辑部加强对于宪法草案的学习，以提高认识水平；另一方面要帮助编辑部克服和防止对于宪法草案宣传的临时观点和松懈情绪。应当看到，目前不少地区关于宪法草案的宣传还不深不透，有待进一步开展，同时宪法草案的宣传在全国范围内也还没有进入高潮。这就说明了我们的报纸绝不可以放松关于宪法草案的宣传，恰恰相反，它必须以更大的努力来深入这一宣传，进一步发挥报纸在制定宪法这一重大政治事件中的动员和组织作用。
