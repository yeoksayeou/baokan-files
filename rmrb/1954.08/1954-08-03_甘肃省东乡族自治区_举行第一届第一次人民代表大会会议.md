Gansu Province Dongxiang Autonomous Region

First Session of the First People's Congress Held

The first session of the first People's Congress of the Dongxiang Autonomous Region, Gansu Province, was held from July 23rd to 26th. The one hundred and ten representatives of the Dongxiang, Hui, and Han nationalities who participated in the meeting conscientiously fulfilled their duties as people's representatives with the attitude of masters of their own affairs. When reviewing and discussing the work of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, they unanimously pointed out that, under the correct leadership of the Party and the higher-level People's Government, the various tasks of the Autonomous Region have achieved great success in the past six months. Since the beginning of spring this year, the Autonomous Region has concentrated more than 90% of its cadres to go deep into the rural areas to specifically lead farmers of all ethnic groups in carrying out spring plowing and sowing work on the basis of developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, making the sown area of summer crops exceed that of last year by 10%. Combining this work, they successfully completed the grassroots election work. Last year, the Autonomous Region generally suffered from drought. In light of this situation, the People's Government of the Autonomous Region adopted various measures this year to vigorously help farmers develop production. In the past six months, it has successively issued various agricultural loans of 1.8 billion yuan, relief funds of 1.82 billion yuan, and social relief funds of more than 149 million yuan, and helped Dongxiang farmers who lacked draft animals and farm tools purchase more than 200 draft animals and more than 3,000 farm tools, solving the difficulties of food, seeds, and draft animals for farmers in the disaster areas, enabling them to safely overcome the disaster. The Dongxiang Autonomous Region is a perennially arid mountainous area. In order to fundamentally change its poverty, the People's Government of the Autonomous Region has paid special attention to the development and consolidation of mutual aid and cooperative organizations this year, and on this basis has universally carried out the work of building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, planting trees and afforestation, and improving mountainous farming techniques. At present, there are more than 700 mutual aid teams that have been gradually consolidated after rectification in the entire region, and two agricultural production cooperatives are being prepared for establishment; several water channels irrigated farmland invested by the state, some of which have been completed. After all these canals are completed, Dongxiang farmers can increase grain production by more than 3 million kilograms per year.

At the meeting, the representatives were satisfied and affirmed the above-mentioned achievements, but also pointed out the shortcomings in the work, and urged the People's Government of the Autonomous Region to improve them in the future, and put forward 25 proposals related to the development of agricultural production. The conference resolved that the Autonomous Region should vigorously carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the future, and grasp the key to increasing production in the local area, and continue to carry out the mass movement of finding water sources, reporting water sources, and building water conservancy projects.

The meeting enthusiastically discussed the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, adopted a resolution supporting the draft Constitution and organizing the people to discuss the draft Constitution, and elected representatives to the Provincial People's Congress.

    甘肃省东乡族自治区
    举行第一届第一次人民代表大会会议
    甘肃省东乡族自治区第一届第一次人民代表大会会议，七月二十三日到二十六日举行。参加会议的一百一十名东乡、回、汉族代表都以主人翁的态度，认真地履行了人民代表的职责。他们在审查、讨论自治区人民政府的工作时，一致指出：在党和上级人民政府的正确领导下，自治区半年来的各项工作都取得很大成绩。今年入春以来，自治区集中百分之九十以上的干部深入农村，具体领导各族农民在开展互助合作运动的基础上进行了春耕播种工作，使夏田播种面积超过了去年的百分之十，并结合这一工作胜利地完成了基层选举工作。去年自治区普遍遭受了旱灾，自治区人民政府根据这种情况，今年采取各种措施大力帮助农民发展生产。半年来，先后发放了各种农业贷款十八亿元、救济款十八亿两千万元、社会救济款一亿四千九百多万元，并帮助缺乏耕畜和农具的东乡族农民购买了二百多头耕畜和三千多件农具，解决了灾区农民的口粮、籽种、耕畜等困难，使他们安全渡过了灾荒。东乡族自治区是一个常年干旱的山区，为了从根本上改变它的贫困面貌，今年自治区人民政府特别注意发展和巩固互助合作组织的工作，并在这一基础上普遍开展了兴修小型农田水利、植树造林和改进山区耕作技术的工作。现在，全区经过整顿逐渐巩固起来的互助组已有七百多个，并正在筹备建立两个农业生产合作社；由国家投资兴修的灌溉农田的几条水渠，有的已经完工。这些水渠全部完工后，东乡族农民每年可以增产三百多万斤粮食。
    会上，代表们满意地肯定了上述成绩，同时也指出了工作中的缺点，责成自治区人民政府今后加以改进，并提出有关发展农业生产的提案二十五件。大会决议今后自治区应大力开展互助合作运动，并抓住当地增产的关键，继续开展群众性的找水源、报水源、兴修水利的运动。
    会议热烈讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案，通过了拥护宪法草案和组织人民群众讨论宪法草案的决议，选出了省人民代表大会的代表。　（新华社）
