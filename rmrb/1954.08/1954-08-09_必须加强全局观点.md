    It is Necessary to Strengthen the Overall Perspective

    With the development of national construction work, some enterprises need to change their affiliation, the purpose of which is to give full play to their role in national construction. However, in the task of taking over the Shandong Linglong Mining Company, the Chemical Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry experienced a serious phenomenon of no one being responsible, causing undue losses to the country.

    Since the implementation of the responsibility system in factories and mining enterprises in various places, our enterprise leading cadres and the broad masses of workers have recognized the serious harm of the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and this phenomenon has indeed decreased compared to the past. However, why has such a serious phenomenon of no one being responsible occurred in the handover work of an industrial leading organ like the Chemical Industry Bureau? Of course, there may be some objective reasons for the phenomenon of no one being responsible in the takeover work. However, the main reason why this serious phenomenon of no one being responsible has continued for a year and a half, and cannot be corrected even after it is discovered, is the lack of an overall perspective. Because the Chemical Industry Bureau did not resolutely consider the issue from the perspective of overall interests, it adopted an attitude of indifference towards state property.

    The original Linglong Mining Company had more than 40 billion yuan in assets and more than 1,000 staff members. Rationally utilizing and handling this equipment and manpower, and giving full play to their due role in the national construction work, is a common requirement of the state and the people, and it is also the task that the taking-over department should undertake. But how did the Chemical Industry Bureau treat this issue? We can clearly see from the letter of reader Chen Lijun: the equipment that can be used by the unit is called by the production and geological departments of the Chemical Industry Bureau through the manager's office; but for the handover procedures and the issues that need to be cleared up, they feel it is "troublesome" and are unwilling to assume the responsibility that they should bear for the country, so that the requests and reports submitted below regarding budget and organizational structure are pushed back and forth between departments, and are not approved after nine months. In particular, the Geological Department, after the Bureau Director decided that they would be responsible for handling the issues of Linglong Mining Company, refused to implement the Bureau Director's instructions in order to save trouble for the unit, causing greater losses to the country. Precisely because of this, the handover issue was dragged on for a year and a half without anyone taking care of it. How did the leading comrades of the Chemical Industry Bureau treat this issue? When they learned that a part of the loss-making expenditures and stagnant materials in the 1952 annual final accounts of the original Linglong Mining Company were re-evaluated at a higher price than the original value, they requested the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Central Financial and Economic Commission to ask the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry to change the final accounts and not to transfer the stagnant materials; after this request was not approved by the higher authorities, they put aside the takeover issue. Because these leading cadres did not resolutely consider the issue from the perspective of national interests, although they knew that there was a serious phenomenon of no one being responsible in the takeover work, and felt that this situation was not good, they also held meetings, made resolutions, and approved notes, but they could not resolutely correct the erroneous thinking of their subordinates and correct the phenomenon of no one being responsible. Precisely because of this, the handover issue was brought to the Bureau Director's attention several times but still could not be resolved.

    We should attach importance to the lessons of this incident. This is not only because the country has suffered huge losses in this incident, but more importantly, this phenomenon is not an isolated case in the takeover work. Therefore, we must strengthen the overall perspective in the takeover work and strengthen the sense of responsibility for state property. The phenomenon of only being concerned about the "losses" or "benefits", "saving trouble" or "trouble" of one's own unit, regardless of the country's losses, cannot be allowed to continue to exist and occur. In the future takeover work, both the original departments and the taking-over departments must proceed from the overall interests and be responsible for making proper arrangements. Only in this way can we avoid the chaotic state of interrupted leadership and many unnecessary losses, and ensure the smooth production and work of the enterprises being taken over, so that the adjustment of leadership relations can achieve the purpose of meeting the requirements of the national economic construction cause.

### 必须加强全局观点

    必须加强全局观点
    随着国家建设工作的发展，某些企业需要更改隶属关系，其目的在于充分发挥它们在国家建设中的作用。但中央重工业部化学工业管理局在接管山东玲珑矿业公司这一任务中，却发生了严重的无人负责现象，使国家受到了不应有的损失。
    自从在各地厂矿企业推行了建立责任制的工作以来，我们的企业领导干部和广大职工都认识了无人负责现象的严重危害，这种现象确实比过去减少了。但是，像化工局这样一个工业领导机关，在接交工作中竟然还发生了如此严重的无人负责现象，这是为什么呢？当然，接管工作中所以发生无人负责现象，可能有一些客观原因。但是，这种严重的无人负责现象继续存在一年半之久，虽然发现了也不能得到纠正，其主要的原因只有一个，这就是缺乏全局观点。因为化工局没有坚决地从整体利益出发来考虑问题，所以对国家财产采取了不关心的态度。
    原玲珑矿业公司有四百多亿元资产和一千多个工作人员。合理地利用和处理这些设备、人力，充分发挥它们在国家建设工作中应有的作用，这是国家和人民的共同要求，也是接管部门应该担负的任务。但是，化工局是怎样对待这个问题的呢？我们可以清楚地从读者陈力军的来信中看到：可以供本单位利用的设备，化工局的生产处和地质处就通过经理处去调用；但是对于交接手续及需要清理善后的问题都嫌“麻烦”，不愿意担负起对国家应该担负的责任，以致于下面呈报的预算和组织机构等问题的请示报告，在各处之间推来推去，经过九个月而不加批复。特别是地质处，在局长决定由他们负责处理玲珑矿业公司的问题后，为了本单位省事，竟拒绝执行局长的指示，使国家遭受更大的损失。正是由于这样，交接问题就拖了一年半一直没有人管。化工局的领导同志又是怎样对待这个问题的呢？当他们知道原玲珑矿业公司一九五二年年度决算中有一部分损失性的支出和呆滞材料经重新估价比原值高了以后，就呈请中央重工业部和中央财政经济委员会要求山东省工业厅更改决算和不移交呆滞材料；在这个呈请没被上级同意以后，他们就放下接管问题不管了。因为这些领导干部也不是坚决地从国家利益出发考虑问题，所以他们虽然知道了接管工作中有严重无人负责现象，觉得这种情况不好，也开了会，也作了决议，也批了条子，但是不能坚决地纠正下级的错误思想，纠正无人负责的现象。正是由于这样，交接问题几次提到局长面前而仍然不能解决。
    我们应该重视这一事件的教训。这不仅是由于国家在这一事件中受到了巨大的损失，更重要的还在于这种现象在接管工作中并不是个别的。因此，我们必须加强接管工作中的全局观点，加强对国家财产的负责精神。那种只是斤斤计较于本单位的“吃亏”或“便宜”，“省事”或“麻烦”，而不管国家损失的现象是不能让它继续存在和发生了。在今后的接管工作中，原属部门和接管部门双方都必须从整体利益出发，负责地作好妥善的安排，只有这样，才能避免领导中断的混乱状态和很多不应有的损失，才能保证所接交的企业生产和工作顺利进行，使领导关系的调整达到适应国家经济建设事业要求的目的。
