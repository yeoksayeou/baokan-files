    Proposal
    Wang Yang
    The draft constitution stipulates: "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people." What a resounding voice this is!
    The people of Dongguan Township, Third District, Qixian County, Shanxi Province, after the general election in July of last year, established an organ to exercise their power—the Township People's Congress. From July of last year to June of this year, the people of the entire township, through their representatives, submitted 101 proposals to the government. Some of these proposals were valuable suggestions, and some were sincere criticisms. These 101 proposals are a concentrated expression of the exercise of power by the 3,219 citizens of the entire township. These proposals are like a mirror, from which the county, district, and township people's governments saw shortcomings in their work; saw the dust on themselves; saw more ways to improve their work; and saw the encouragement and support of the broad masses of people for them, which increased their courage and confidence to improve their work.
    One proposal reads as follows:
    In June 1952, when the wheat was about to ear, there was a drought and aphid pests. The masses requested to irrigate the wheat fields first and then kill the aphids. Gao Tingren, the deputy district chief (formerly a production assistant) working in Dongguan Town, received instructions from the county at this time: to mobilize the masses to kill the aphids. He did not consider the local situation or consult with the masses, and simply issued an order: "Stop all work, and mobilize all men, women, and children in the town to kill aphids!" Some farmers secretly watered the wheat fields, and he reprimanded them severely when he found out. Although the masses did not raise objections, they were actually passively resisting and sent people to take turns on the lookout. When they saw him coming, they would shout loudly to prepare everyone to cope.
    Another proposal stated that Yan Chunsheng, a cadre of the district women's federation, had a very bad attitude toward the masses. When summoning women to meetings, she would scold those who could not come for reasons, saying, "Afraid of being eaten by wolves!" She would scold those who were late, saying, "Shameless!" When the meeting started and the women didn't speak, she would scold them, "Have you got diphtheria?!" So the women avoided her whenever they saw her.
    All errors and illegal and undisciplined acts of cadres were exposed by the masses one by one.
    After these proposals were collected, they were first sorted out by a proposal review group composed of representatives, and then submitted to the Township People's Congress for review and discussion. During the review and discussion, the representatives used a serious and responsible attitude to verify and distinguish the proposals. Xu Ziying, the director of the agricultural production cooperative, said: "That year, when killing aphids, I was the town chief. From the bottom of my heart, I disagreed with the district chief's approach. If I didn't do it, I couldn't explain it to the district chief. If I did it, it would cause dissatisfaction among the masses. It really put me in a dilemma!" Cheng Sinu, a labor model, said: "Yan Chunsheng's attitude toward the masses was not at all false. I have heard many women complain about it." The representatives also provided testimonial and material evidence for other issues. Especially during the discussion of the issue of Deputy District Chief Gao Tingren, the representatives spoke enthusiastically. Some representatives suggested: "Gao Tingren is not qualified to be a district chief!" Some representatives disagreed, saying: "It's too early to say that. We should see his attitude towards accepting criticism from the masses before we talk." After careful discussion by the representatives, they finally reached a consensus: to let Deputy District Chief Gao make a public self-criticism.
    At a township-wide electoral meeting, Deputy District Chief Gao Tingren stood in front of the masses, with thousands of pairs of eyes watching him. What people saw on his face was no longer the glaring and angry look of the past, but a gentle and amiable expression. Gao Deputy District Chief himself felt very different from the past. He used to think that he was smarter than the masses in everything, but today, standing among the masses, he felt very small. He said excitedly: "Originally, I was just like everyone else, a farmer. But after I became a cadre, I forgot my roots, stood above the masses and issued orders, and didn't care about the hardships of the masses, turning good things into bad things and causing losses in production. I'm really sorry to everyone. Your sincere criticism of me has given me a great education. I am very grateful for your concern and care for me!" Finally, Deputy District Chief Gao expressed to everyone: "In the future, I am determined to overcome the style of forced orders, work hard to serve the people, and be a good hired hand of the people." The masses happily said after hearing this: "This is our good district chief!"
    Other cadres who were criticized also made self-criticisms; those with serious circumstances were disciplined.
    Under the supervision of the people, the ideological style of these cadres has now changed. Whenever any of them are transferred from this township to another, they humbly solicit the opinions of the masses, thereby strengthening their relationship with the masses and deepening the people's trust in the government. People said: "Some of our government's bad cadres have become good!"
    After this self-criticism, Deputy District Chief Gao Tingren further realized the significance of working under the supervision of the people. He said: "Working is for the people, and the object of work is also the people. If we don't accept the supervision of the people, we will become detached from the people, lose the object of work, and of course, we will not be able to serve the people." He also said: "After studying the draft constitution, I have a deeper understanding that the rights of the people are sacred and should not be violated by anyone. In the future, I must be more humble and cautious and wholeheartedly work for the people."
    The people of Dongguan Township also realized from their actual life experiences that the people have truly become the masters of the country. After studying the draft constitution, they further understood the meaning of "all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people."

    提案
    汪洋
    宪法草案规定：“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。”这是多么响亮的声音啊！
    山西祁县三区东观乡人民经过去年七月间的普选，成立了行使自己权力的机关——乡人民代表大会。从去年七月到今年六月，全乡人民通过自己的代表向政府提出过一百零一件提案。这些提案，有的是宝贵的建议，有的是热诚的批评。这一百零一件提案是全乡三千二百一十九个公民行使自己权力的集中表现。这些提案像一面镜子，县、区、乡人民政府从这面镜子里看到了工作中的缺点；看到了自己身上的灰尘；看到了更多改进工作的办法；看到了广大人民群众对他们的鼓舞和支援，增加了他们改进工作的勇气和信心。
    有一件提案中这样写道：
    一九五二年六月，麦子将要吐穗，天旱不雨，又发生蚜虫灾害。群众要求先浇麦地，后灭蚜虫。在东观镇工作的副区长（原任生产助理员）高廷仁，就在这时候接到县里的指示：发动群众扑灭蚜虫。他既没有考虑当地情况，也没有和群众商量，照样下了一道命令：“停止一切工作，全镇男女老少总动员扑灭蚜虫！”有的农民悄悄浇麦地，他发现后就大加训斥。群众虽然不提意见，但实际上是在消极应付，并派人轮流放哨，见他走来就高声喊叫，好让大家准备应付。
    还有一件提案提出，区妇联干部阎春生，对待群众的态度十分恶劣。召集妇女们开会时，有的妇女因故不能来，她就骂：“怕狼吃了！”有的妇女来迟一步，她就骂：“真不要脸！”开起会来，妇女们不发言，她就骂：“你们得了白喉啦！”所以妇女们见了她都躲躲闪闪。
    凡是干部有错误的，有违法乱纪行为的，都被群众一一揭发。
    这些提案收集起来之后，先经过代表们组成的提案审查小组加以整理，然后提交乡人民代表大会审查讨论。在审查讨论中，代表们都用严肃认真的态度对提案进行了对证、甄别。农业生产合作社社长续子英说：“那年灭蚜虫时，我正当镇长。从我本心里说，我也不同意区长的做法，想不干吧，对区长交代不了，干吧，惹起群众不满。真是弄得我两头为难！”劳动模范程四奴说：“阎春生对群众耍态度，这提案没有一点虚假。我听见好多妇女都反映过。”其他问题，代表们也都提出了人证物证。特别是在讨论副区长高廷仁的问题时，代表们更是热烈发言。有的代表提出：“高廷仁不够当区长的资格！”有的代表不同意这个意见，说：“这话说得太早，应该看他接受群众批评的态度如何再说。”经代表们认真讨论，最后取得一致意见：让高副区长当众进行检讨。
    在一次全乡选民大会上，高廷仁副区长站在群众面前，几千双眼睛看着他，人们从他脸上所看到的不再是往日那副瞪眼发怒的神气，而是和颜悦色了。高副区长自己感觉到的也和往日大不一样，过去认为自己比群众什么都高明，而今天站在群众中却感到自己十分渺小。他激动地说：“原先我和大家一样，也是一个农民，可是我当了干部以后，就忘了本，站在群众头上发号施令，不关心群众疾苦，把好事办坏，使生产受到损失。我真对不起大家。大家热诚地对我提出批评，给了我很大教育。大家这样关心我，爱护我，我非常感激！”最后，高副区长向大家表示：“今后决心克服强迫命令作风，努力为人民服务，当一个人民的好长工。”群众听了欢喜地说：“这样才是我们的好区长哩！”
    其他被批评的干部，也都分别作了检讨；情节严重的并受到纪律处分。
    这些干部在人民监督之下，现在思想作风都已经有了转变。每当他们中有人从这个乡调到另一个乡工作时，都要虚心征求群众意见，因而也就密切了和群众的关系，同时也更加深了人民对政府的信任。人们说：“咱们政府有些不好的干部可变好了！”
    高廷仁副区长经过这次检讨，进一步认识到在人民监督之下进行工作的意义。他说：“做工作是为了人民，工作的对象也是人民，如果不接受人民的监督，就会脱离人民，就会失去工作对象，当然也就无法为人民服务。”他又说：“学习了宪法草案，我更深刻认识到：人民的权利是神圣的，不允许任何人来侵犯，今后更要谦虚谨慎，全心全意替人民办事。”
    东观乡的人民群众，从他们实际生活体验当中也同样认识到：人民真正成了国家的主人。学习了宪法草案，他们进一步懂得了“中华人民共和国的
  一切权力属于人民”的意义。
