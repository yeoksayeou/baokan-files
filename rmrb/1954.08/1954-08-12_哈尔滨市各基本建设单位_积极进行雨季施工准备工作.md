Harbin City's basic construction units are actively preparing for rainy season construction to ensure the comprehensive completion of their third-quarter engineering tasks.

According to data from the Harbin Meteorological Observatory, there will be more rain in August this year, which will affect the completion of engineering tasks. To this end, construction units are currently actively preparing a large number of rainproof equipment to ensure construction during the rainy season. For example, the Northeast Second Engineering Company, to ensure the completion of key engineering tasks, plans to prepare 5,440 square meters of linen cloth, 216 kilograms of hemp rope, and 150 pieces of oilcloth for rain shelters. In addition, it is also planned to buy more than 800 raincoats, more than 600 pairs of rubber shoes, and more than 800 straw hats for workers; and purchase two sets of lightning rods to ensure the safety of construction during the rainy season. Currently, some of the equipment has arrived at various work areas and is being put into rainy season construction.

While adhering to the principle of thrift, each unit has also taken the necessary preparations for rainy season construction for general projects. For example, the Instrument Factory construction site has already dug drainage ditches for the foundation project and is preparing to build sheds with straw mats. The Harbin Medical University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and other construction sites have also taken various measures.

    哈尔滨市各基本建设单位
    积极进行雨季施工准备工作
    哈尔滨市各基本建设施工单位，为了保证全面地完成第三季度工程任务，正积极进行雨季施工的准备工作。
    根据哈尔滨市气象台的资料，今年八月多雨，将影响工程任务的完成。为此，各施工单位目前正积极准备大批防雨设备，以保证在雨期施工。如东北第二工程公司为保证重点工程任务的完成，计划准备五千四百四十平方公尺亚麻布、二百一十六公斤麻绳和一百五十块油布做为防雨棚之用。另外，还计划给工人买八百多件雨衣、六百多双胶鞋和八百多顶草帽子；购置两组避雷针，以保证雨期施工的安全。目前，已有一部分设备到达各工区，投入雨期施工。
    各单位在节约原则下，对一般工程也采取了必要的雨季施工准备。如仪表厂工地已挖好基础工程的排水沟，正准备用席子搭棚。哈尔滨医科大学、哈尔滨工业大学等工地也都同样采取了各种措施。
