    Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report, and the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee approving this diplomatic report, provide a clear description and stipulation of our country's foreign policy implementation during the Geneva Conference and future tasks. These two documents tell the people of the whole country, and also the whole world, how the People's Republic of China, as a world power, has fought for peace, and how it will continue to fight for world peace in the future. Without a doubt, these two historic documents are not only extremely important to the people of our country, but everyone in the world must pay attention to them, because this is the voice of 600 million people who have stood up, and it is a voice that no one can ignore.
    The first impression that Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report and the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee give us is that the international status of our great motherland has greatly improved. Although the U.S. government attempts to deny our country's status as a world power, the fact is already clearly displayed: without the participation of the People's Republic of China, world, especially Asian, international problems cannot be solved. If, from 1840 to 1949, in those 109 years, China's diplomacy was only a record of the humiliation suffered by the Chinese nation, then, in the five years since liberation, a great change has taken place. Our diplomacy is no longer humiliating diplomacy, and the fate of our country can no longer be arbitrarily manipulated by foreign invaders.
    Our people have stood up. Our country is the most populous country in the world, but we will never invade other countries, but will unswervingly fight for world peace. Our country maintains a fraternal relationship unprecedented in history with the socialist Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, which makes the world's peace forces far outweigh the forces of aggression. Our country advocates consolidating and developing peaceful cooperative relations with all countries with different social and political systems, based on the five principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. When the U.S. invading army launched the Korean War and simultaneously occupied Taiwan and, four months later, fought to the Yalu River in Korea, our people once resisted U.S. aggression and aided Korea to protect their homes and defend the country; but this war was to stop the U.S. armed aggression in Korea, achieve a truce in Korea, and further peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Therefore, its purpose was also for peace. At the Geneva conference table, and in the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India, and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, our government adopted a constructive and consultative attitude to seek to reach an agreement with all its strength, leading to peace. Precisely because we are so persistently fighting for peace, precisely because we are neither afraid of any aggressor, nor do we exclude any country from the scope of peaceful coexistence because another country's social and political systems are different from ours, our foreign activities are always just and supported by the broad masses of peace-loving people around the world. This is the fundamental reason why our country's international status has improved.
    However, the success of the Geneva Conference and the success of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks cannot make us complacent, thinking that everything is going well, and that we can close our doors and bury ourselves in construction. On the contrary, the current international situation further increases our tasks.
    Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out the characteristics of the current international situation in his diplomatic report: "In order to pursue world hegemony, the U.S. aggressive bloc has consistently implemented a policy of strength to expand armaments and prepare for war, and has continuously instigated and organized various opposing military blocs for the purpose of aggression in Asia and Europe, in order to create international tension and facilitate profiting from it. Especially in Asia, their aggressive activities are even more blatant. The U.S. aggressive bloc launched the war of aggression against Korea, stepped up interference in the war in Indochina, and at the same time occupied our territory of Taiwan. Now, the Korean War has long been stopped, and peace in Indochina has also been restored. The results of the Geneva Conference proved the victory of the forces of peace and the failure of the forces of war, but the U.S. aggressive bloc is not reconciled to this failure. They are stepping up their instructions and assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, carrying out more rampant harassing and destructive wars against the Chinese mainland and coastal areas, actively reviving Japanese militarism, and stepping up their plans to organize the 'Pacific Anti-Communist Military Alliance' and aggressive blocs in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, in order to create new tensions in various regions of Asia. This aggressive policy of the U.S. aggressive bloc is the root cause of the constant threat to peace in Asia and the world." Therefore, "it is necessary to smash the U.S. aggressive bloc's conspiracy to create new tensions, so that their aggressive policy will continue to suffer defeat. The tasks now placed before us are: to work hard with the countries concerned to jointly ensure the thorough implementation of the various agreements of the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina, and to continue to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue; to resolutely liberate Taiwan and safeguard the integrity of our country's sovereignty and territory; to consolidate and develop our country's peaceful cooperative relations with various countries based on the five principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, and to strive to establish collective peace in Asia."
    The resolution of the Central People's Government Committee approved Premier Zhou's report and expressed agreement with the joint statements issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma respectively, as well as the communiqué of the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and Germany. At the same time, this resolution also expressed agreement with the Soviet government's proposal to convene a conference of European countries and its proposal to hold a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States. The three tasks mentioned in Premier Zhou's report are already the current goals that our government and our people must accomplish.
    We fully support Premier Zhou's diplomatic report and the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee. These two documents have pointed out the direction of struggle for the people of our country. The people of the whole country must pay attention to these issues. It must be known that struggling for the above-mentioned tasks is struggling for a peaceful environment. If we do not strive to win victory in this struggle, then our socialist construction cause will continue to be threatened by the U.S. aggressive bloc, and we will also fail to live up to the expectations of the peace-loving people of the world for the people of our country.
    Here, we want to especially talk about the issue of liberating Taiwan, refute the fallacies spread by the U.S. aggressors recently, and explain some issues to some friends.
    The fallacy recently spread by the U.S. aggressors is to slander the just slogan of liberating Taiwan put forward by the people of our country as "creating world tensions."
    Now, let's look at the facts to see who is creating tensions. The United States sent armed forces to our country's territory—Taiwan—to infringe upon our country's sovereignty and occupy our country's territory. We have not sent any armed forces to the territory of the United States to carry out aggression against the United States. The United States uses Taiwan as a military base, instructing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to wage war against our country. Our country has not forcibly occupied Honolulu or other places in the United States, instructing Americans to fight against the United States. No one can say that this kind of action by the United States is for promoting world peace, for easing the situation, and for enabling all countries in the world to get what they deserve. In the face of such clear facts, people can only admit that this aggressive action by the United States is making the Far East situation, which is trending towards easing, become more tense day by day.
    First of all, Taiwan is Chinese territory and should be handed over to the legitimate Chinese government, namely the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. This is not only the understanding of peace-loving people in all countries of the world, but also many newspapers in Western countries, even American newspapers, have to admit this. The British magazine "New Statesman" said on July 22, 1950: "Taiwan is an indivisible part of China. It was Acheson himself who, in his cautious statement to the press in January of this year, rejected the following argument as a mere legal evasion. The argument is that because Taiwan was under Japanese occupation until 1945, it could be placed under trusteeship before the final peace treaty was signed." The American "Christian Science Monitor" said on August 8, 1950: "China has been ruled by Peiping (referring to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China), and it was agreed at the wartime Four Powers Conference that Taiwan should be returned to China. To consider that Taiwan should now belong to China is at least a lawyer's argument."
    It is completely legitimate for the People's Republic of China to crusade against the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and even Western public opinion has to admit this. The "New Statesman" said on August 12, 1950: "Even the 'Observer,' which is extremely careful to avoid criticizing the United States, now points out frankly and boldly that there is no doubt that if Taiwan is used by Chiang Kai-shek as a base for military operations, regardless of any views on the legal status of Taiwan, Mao Zedong's attack on Taiwan will be considered justified. ... In Asia, no country does not think that Mao Zedong will inevitably eventually clear the remnants of the Kuomintang from Taiwan and complete his revolutionary victory."
    It is also a matter of course that the Americans should leave Taiwan. The British "New Lancashire Daily" said on November 30, 1950, on this issue: "The Americans have no right to stay in Taiwan. Imagine what attitude the Americans would take if China sent a large number of troops to interfere in the civil war in Mexico and at the same time occupied Cuba." The "New Statesman" said on August 12, 1950: "If a war breaks out between China and the United States over the Taiwan issue, the aggressor will not be the Communists."
    Conversely, let's take a look: what are the purposes of the U.S. aggressors in occupying Taiwan and supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique?
    The purpose of the U.S. aggressors is to protect the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and use Taiwan as one of the three strongholds for aggression against our country, in order to conspire to subvert the People's Republic of China. On July 18, 1953, Chase, the so-called "Chief of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan," said: "Taiwan has great strategic significance," and "The Kuomintang army is a property of the U.S. defense." On June 30, 1953, U.S. Senator Smith said: "Korea, Taiwan, and Indochina are three extremely important strongholds for the United States..." On February 4, 1953, U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Wiley said that President Eisenhower's order to "recall" the U.S. Seventh Fleet has special strategic significance, "the purpose is to open the door for the Kuomintang to bomb the 2,000-mile railway from Manchuria to Guangzhou, bomb the South China Sea, and bomb the border of French Indochina." On March 5, 1953, U.S. Congressman Judd said that it is necessary to "rouse" the "courage" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and help them to "overthrow from within" the People's Republic of China.
    Another purpose of the U.S. aggressors is to use Taiwan as a base to carry out military aggression not only against China, but also against all Asian countries. U.S. Senator Dirksen said on June 30, 1953: "I am afraid we have a wrong idea, regarding Taiwan as a springboard or starting point for possibly invading the Chinese mainland in the long run. In fact, Taiwan has much greater significance to the United States. It is the springboard for Japan to attack and finally occupy Indochina, and it is the springboard for Japan to attack various places in the Pacific."
    Yet another purpose of the U.S. aggressors is to use the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to provoke a world war, which is manifested in the countless facts of the U.S. aggressive bloc instigating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out war clamors and piracy. Bevan, one of the leaders of the British Labor Party, once said: "As long as Chiang Kai-shek threatens the Chinese mainland, peace is impossible."
    Now, let's ask, who is creating tensions? Obviously, it is not China, but the U.S. aggressive bloc. It is completely legitimate for the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This is for the noble purpose of defending the motherland, defending peace in Asia, and defending world peace. This is precisely in line with our country's domestic policy, in line with our country's foreign policy, and also in line with the interests of the people of Asia and the world.
    Premier Zhou Enlai said in his report: "The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is the struggle to defend world peace." This is an irrefutable truth, a truth that the U.S. propaganda machine can never refute.
    After Premier Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report was published, the U.S. propaganda machine again used war to threaten the Chinese people. They should know that the Chinese people have strong bones and will never be intimidated. Taiwan must be liberated by the Chinese people. The United States will never be allowed to occupy it, will never be allowed to be placed under UN trusteeship, and will never be allowed to be "neutralized." The so-called Taiwan "neutralization" was announced by Truman in June 1950, when he invaded Korea. Facts have proven that this is a synonym for "U.S. occupation." The so-called Taiwan "being placed under UN trusteeship" is to deny that Taiwan is Chinese territory and, in fact, to hand over Taiwan to the United States, which now controls the United Nations. If this is done, it will only encourage the U.S. aggressors, fuel their arrogance, and may lead to the arrival of a world war. This is not beneficial to China, not beneficial to peace in Asia, and not beneficial to world peace. Therefore, we cannot accept this suggestion. Since we are fighting for peace, and since we advocate that all countries should respect each other's territorial sovereignty, not invade each other, and not interfere in each other's internal affairs, then we must liberate our own territory of Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We will never stop until we achieve our goal.
    Premier Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report and the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee call on the people of the whole country to fight for justice. We firmly believe that the cause of justice will surely prevail.

    正义必定胜利
    周恩来总理兼外长的外交报告，和中央人民政府委员会关于批准这个外交报告的决议，对于我国外交政策在日内瓦会议期间的实施，和今后的任务，作了明确的叙述和规定。这两个文件，告诉全国人民，也告诉全世界，作为一个世界大国的中华人民共和国，是怎样为和平而奋斗的，并且以后将要怎样来继续为世界和平而奋斗。毫无疑问，这两个历史性的文件，不但对于我国人民来说是极其重要的，并且全世界上，不论是什么人，都不能不加以注意，因为这是已经站立起来了的六万万人的呼声，是任何人不能加以忽视的。
    周总理兼外长的外交报告和中央人民政府委员会的决议首先给我们的印象，就是我们的伟大祖国的国际地位大大提高了。尽管美国政府企图否认我国的世界大国的地位，但是事实已经明明地摆着：没有中华人民共和国的参与，世界的特别是亚洲的国际问题是无法解决的。如果从一八四零年到一九四九年一百零九年中，中国的外交只是一部中华民族受屈辱的记录，那么，解放以后的五年中，就发生了一个大变化。我们的外交再不是屈辱的外交，我们国家的命运再不是外国侵略者所可以任意摆布的了。
    我们的人民已经站起来了。我们的国家是世界上人口最多的国家，但是我们决不侵略别国，而是坚定不渝地为世界和平而斗争。我国与社会主义的苏联和各人民民主国家，保持着一种史无前例的兄弟般的关系，这就使得世界和平力量大大超过了侵略势力。我国主张与一切社会制度政治制度不同的国家，根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，巩固和发展相互之间的和平合作关系。当美国侵略军在发动朝鲜战争的同时侵占台湾、并在四个月之后在朝鲜打到鸭绿江边时，我国人民曾经为了保家卫国而抗美援朝；但是这个战争是为了制止美国在朝鲜的武装侵略，达成朝鲜的停战，并进一步和平解决朝鲜问题。因此，其目的也是为了和平。在日内瓦的会议桌上，在中印两国总理、中缅两国总理的会谈中，我国政府采取建设性的协商的态度，以全力谋求达成协议，导致和平。正由于我们是这样坚持不懈地为和平而斗争，正由于我们既不惧怕任何侵略者，也不因为别国与我国社会制度政治制度有所不同，而把任何一国排斥在和平共处的范围之外，所以我国的对外活动，就时时是正义的，是得到全世界广大的爱好和平人民的拥护的。这就是我国国际地位提高起来的根本原因。
    但是，日内瓦会议的成功，中印、中缅会谈的成功，丝毫不能使我们骄傲起来，以为万事大吉了，以为我们可以关起大门来埋头建设了。相反的，目前的国际形势，更加加重了我们的任务。
    周恩来总理兼外长在他的外交报告中，指出了目前国际形势的特点：“为了追求世界霸权，美国侵略集团一贯地执行扩军备战的实力政策，并不断在亚洲和欧洲策动组织各种各样的以侵略为目的的对立的军事集团，以制造国际的紧张局势，便于从中取利。尤其是在亚洲，他们的侵略活动更加露骨。美国侵略集团发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，加紧干涉了印度支那的战争，同时，并侵占了我国的领土台湾。现在，朝鲜的战争早已停了，印度支那的和平也恢复了。日内瓦会议的结果，证明了和平力量的胜利，战争势力的失败，但是，美国侵略集团却不甘心于这一失败。他们正在加紧指使和援助蒋介石卖国集团，对中国大陆和沿海更加猖獗地进行骚扰性的和破坏性的战争，积极复活日本军国主义，加紧策划组织‘太平洋反共军事同盟’及东南亚和中东的侵略集团，以图在亚洲各地区造成新的紧张局势。美国侵略集团的这种侵略政策，就是亚洲及世界的和平不断遭受威胁的根源。”因此，“必须击破美国侵略集团制造新的紧张局势的阴谋，使他们的侵略政策继续遭受失败。现在放在我们面前的任务就是：努力与有关国家共同保证彻底实现日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的各项协议，并继续谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决；坚决解放台湾，保障我国主权和领土的完整；根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，巩固和发展我国与各国的和平合作关系，并努力建立亚洲的集体和平。”
    中央人民政府委员会的决议批准了周总理的报告，并对中印两国总理和中缅两国总理分别发表的联合声明以及中德两国总理的会谈公报表示同意。同时，这个决议又对苏联政府关于召开欧洲国家会议的建议和关于举行苏、法、英、美四国外长会议的建议表示同意。周总理报告中所提的三点任务已经是我国政府、我国人民必须完成的当前目标。
    我们完全拥护周总理的外交报告和中央人民政府委员会的决议。这两个文件为我们全国人民指明了奋斗的方向。全国人民必须关心这些问题。必须知道，为上述这些任务而斗争，是为争取一个和平的环境而斗争。如果不努力在这个斗争中取得胜利，那么，我们的社会主义建设事业就会继续不断遭受到美国侵略集团的威胁，我们也就会辜负了世界爱好和平的人民对于我国人民的期望。
    在这里，我们要特别谈一谈解放台湾的问题，驳斥近来美国侵略者所散布的谬论，并且对有些朋友们解释一些问题。
    美国侵略者最近所散布的谬论，就是把我国人民提出解放台湾的正义口号，诬蔑为“制造世界紧张局势”。
    现在，我们拿事实来看一下，究竟是谁在制造紧张局势。美国派了武装力量到我国领土——台湾，侵犯我国主权，侵占我国领土，我们并没有派任何武装力量到美国的领土上去，对美国进行侵略。美国利用台湾作为军事基地，指使蒋介石卖国集团对我国进行战争，我国并没有强占美国的檀香山或其他地方，指使美国人对美国作战。美国的这种行动，任何人不能说是为了促进世界和平，为了和缓局势，使世界各国各得其所。在这样明白的事实前面，人们只能承认：美国的这种侵略行动正在使趋于和缓的远东局势又一天天紧张起来。
    首先，台湾是中国的领土，应当交给合法的中国政府即中华人民共和国中央人民政府。这不但世界各国爱好和平的人民是这样认识的，而且西方国家的许多报纸，甚至美国的报纸，都不能不这样承认。英国“新政治家”杂志一九五○年七月二十二日说：“台湾是中国不可分割的一部分。正是艾奇逊本人在他今年一月里向报界发表的措辞谨慎的声明中，即曾认为下述论点仅是法律上的遁辞而把它弃置一旁。这个论点就是说：由于台湾直到一九四五年为止是在日本占领之下，所以在最后签定和约之前，是可以托管的。”美国“基督教科学箴言报”一九五○年八月八日说：“中国已由北平（指中华人民共和国中央人民政府）统治，而台湾在战时四大国会议时已约定交还中国。认为现在台湾应属于中国，这至少是一个律师的论点。”
    中华人民共和国讨伐蒋介石卖国集团，这是完全正当的，这也是甚至西方舆论都不得不承认的。“新政治家”一九五○年八月十二日说：“即使极为注意避免批评美国的‘观察家报’，现在也直率而大胆地指出，没有疑问，如果台湾被蒋介石用来作为军事行动基地的话，不管对台湾的合法地位所抱何种见解，毛泽东进攻台湾将被认为是正当的。……在亚洲，没有一个国家不以为毛泽东必然最后将国民党的残部从台湾清除出去，完成他的革命胜利。”
    美国人应该离开台湾，这也是天经地义的事情。英国“新兰开夏日报”一九五○年十一月三十日对这个问题说：“美国人没有权利留在台湾。试想如果中国派出大量的军队干涉墨西哥的内战，同时占领古巴，美国人将采取怎样的态度。”“新政治家”一九五○年八月十二日说：“假如就台湾问题，中国和美国之间开始战争，侵略者将不是共产党。”
    反过来，我们看一看：美国侵略者侵占台湾，和扶植蒋介石卖国集团，是为了什么目的呢？
    美国侵略者的目的，是保护蒋介石卖国集团，把台湾作为侵略我国的三个据点之一，来阴谋颠覆中华人民共和国。一九五三年七月十八日，美国所谓“驻台军事援助顾问团团长”蔡斯说：“台湾有很大的战略意义”，“国民党军队是美国防务的一份财产。”一九五三年六月三十日美国参议员史密斯说：“朝鲜、台湾和印度支那是美国……极重要的三据点。”一九五三年二月四日美国参议院外交委员会主席维利说，艾森豪威尔总统命令“召回”美国第七舰队，有特别的战略意义，“其目的是要为国民党轰炸自满洲通向广州二千英里的铁路，轰炸南海以及轰炸法国印度支那的边境，开辟门径。”一九五三年三月五日美国众议员周以德说，必须“鼓起”蒋介石卖国集团的“勇气”，帮助他们来“从内部推翻”中华人民共和国。
    美国侵略者的另一个目的，就是以台湾为基地，不仅向中国进行军事侵略，而且对所有亚洲国家进行军事侵略。美国参议员德克森一九五三年六月三十日说：“我恐怕我们有着一个错误的想法，把台湾看成是一个在长远的将来可能侵入中国大陆的跳板或者出发地点。事实上，台湾对美国有更大得多的意义。它是日本攻击和最后占领印度支那的跳板，它是日本攻击太平洋各地的跳板。”
    美国侵略者的又一个目的，就是要使用蒋介石卖国集团来挑起世界战争，这表现在美国侵略集团嗾使蒋介石卖国集团进行战争叫嚣和海盗行为的无数事实上面。英国工党领袖之一比万就曾经说过：
  “只要蒋介石威胁中国大陆，和平是不可能的。”
    现在，试问究竟是谁在造成紧张局势呢？显然不是中国，而是美国的侵略集团。中国人民要解放台湾，要消灭蒋介石卖国集团，这在法律上和道义上完全是正当的，这是为了保卫祖国，为了保卫亚洲和平，为了保卫世界和平的崇高目的，这正是符合于我国的对内政策，符合于我国的对外政策，也符合于亚洲及世界各国人民的利益。
    周恩来总理在报告中说：“中国人民解放台湾的斗争就是保卫世界和平的斗争。”这是颠扑不破的真理，是美国宣传机关无论如何也驳不倒的真理。
    在周恩来总理的外交报告发表之后，美国的宣传机关又以战争来恐吓中国人民。他们应该知道，中国人民是硬骨头，决不是可以吓得倒的。台湾必须由中国人民解放，决不容许美国侵占，决不容许交联合国托管，决不容许“中立化”。所谓台湾
  “中立化”是杜鲁门在侵略朝鲜的时候，在一九五○年六月就宣布过了的。事实证明，这是“美国占领”的代名词。所谓台湾“交联合国托管”，乃是否认台湾是中国的领土，并且实际上是把台湾交给现在控制着联合国的美国。如果照此做去，只能鼓励美国侵略者，助长其凶焰，并有可能导致世界大战的到来。这对中国不利，对亚洲和平不利，对世界和平不利，因而我们是不能接受这个意见的。我们既然为和平而斗争，既然主张各国应当互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，那末就必须解放自己的领土台湾，必须消灭蒋介石卖国集团，不达目的，决不休止。
    周恩来总理的外交报告，和中央人民政府委员会的决议，号召我们全国人民去为正义而斗争。我们完全相信，正义的事业是必定胜利的。
