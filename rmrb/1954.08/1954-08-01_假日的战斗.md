    Battle on a Holiday
    Chen Pingguan
    This happened one Saturday afternoon in April this year. The sea was calm. After dinner, the sailors changed into their snow-white uniforms. Some wanted to go to the cinema, some to dance in the park, and others were going to visit friends. But suddenly a notice came: "No holiday tomorrow, there is an enemy situation at sea." The sailors were immediately gripped by the enthusiasm to participate in battle. Everyone began to prepare actively, awaiting battle orders.
    The next day, as the east was just turning white, the flotilla set out to sea. A plume of black smoke spurted from the command boat, and the boats behind it also picked up speed.
    As they approached the sea area near a certain island where remnant bandits' ships frequently appeared, the maritime climate suddenly changed. The surrounding area was filled with morning mist, and the shadows of the mountains on both sides gradually dimmed.
    Squad Leader Zhang Jialin ordered the signalman to send the signal "Stop advancing, drop anchor immediately." Signalman Sui Zhiju quickly waved the two red flags, and the flotilla stopped.
    The fog began to dissipate, and the mountain peaks were revealed. Just at this moment, the sentry heard the sound of a motor to the south. The squad leader raised his binoculars to his chest. Sure enough, they spotted an enemy motorized junk to the south, towing a small sampan, heading towards the island; two gunboats were following behind. Based on the situation, the squad leader judged that the enemy was trying to transport special agents here, and the two gunboats behind were preparing to cover the landing. He then ordered all boats: "Raise anchor immediately, prepare for battle!"
    The enemy heard the rumbling of the motors and realized we were there. The two gunboats turned around and fled. The motorized junk near the foot of the mountain, seeing its gunboats running away, fired at us with machine guns while also fleeing with the gunboats.
    The distance closed. The squad leader waved his hand: "Fire!" Instantly, a deafening roar of cannons drowned out the sound of the sea, and shells stirred up towering columns of water around the enemy ships. The artillery fire surrounded all three enemy ships. The two gunboats accelerated to escape, breaking through the artillery fire, while the motorized junk struggled within the encirclement of our artillery fire and returned fire at us with machine guns. A bullet pierced Comrade Zhu Bangdong's abdomen. I ran over to bandage him, but he resolutely said: "Leave me alone, you can't leave your battle station! Struggle requires bloodshed..." He held out his hand, I gripped it tightly, and said excitedly: "Rest well, Comrade Zhu Bangdong, we will definitely avenge you!" As I said this, he fainted.
    After fighting for more than an hour, we finally sank that motorized junk. The two gunboats were also damaged by us, and we killed six bandits (including one boat captain) and wounded sixteen.
    When the flotilla returned to port victoriously, Comrade Zhu Bangdong woke up and asked the comrades beside him: "How was it? Did we catch the enemy?" The comrades comforted him and said: "The enemy's motorized junk was sunk by us."
    The young sailor smiled quietly. He murmured to himself: "For the victory of the battle, even sacrificing oneself is worthwhile."

    假日的战斗
    陈平冠
    这是今年四月间一个星期六的下午，海上风平浪静。吃过晚饭，水兵们都换上雪白的军服，有的想去看电影，有的要到公园去跳舞，还有的准备去找朋友。可是突然来了个通知：“明天不放假，海上有敌情。”参加战斗的热情，立即抓住了水兵们。大家都开始积极地准备，静待战斗的命令。
    第二天，东方刚发白，艇队出港了。指挥艇上喷出一股黑烟，随着后面的艇群也加快了速度。
    驶近残匪舰艇经常出现的某岛海面时，海上的气候突然起了变化，四周弥漫着晨雾，两旁的山影渐渐暗淡下去。
    分队长张家麟命令信号员发出“停止前进，就地抛锚”的信号，信号员隋之聚迅速摆动着两面红旗，艇队停了下来。
    雾开始消散，山峰露出来了。正在这个时候，哨兵听到南面有马达声，分队长举起胸前的望远镜。果然在南面发现一艘敌人的机帆船，拖着一条小舢板，向岛子开来；后面还跟着两艘炮艇。分队长根据情况判断：敌人是企图向这里输送特务，后面两艘炮艇是准备掩护登陆的。他便命令各艇：“立即起锚，准备战斗！”
    敌人听见轰隆隆的马达声，才发现我们，两艘炮艇掉头就跑。靠近山脚下的机帆船见自己的炮艇跑了，一面用机枪向我射击，一面也跟着炮艇逃跑。
    距离拉近了。分队长把手一挥：“打！”顿时，一片震耳的炮声盖过海面，炮弹在敌船四周掀起冲天的水柱。炮火把三艘敌船包围起来了。两艘炮艇加速逃命，突出炮火的包围，机帆船在我炮火包围中挣扎着。并用机枪向我们还击，一颗子弹穿过朱邦栋同志的腹部，我跑上去替他包扎，但他坚决地说：“别管我，你不能离开自己的战斗岗位！斗争是要流血的……”他伸出手来，我把它紧紧握住，激动地说：“你好好休息，朱邦栋同志，我们一定为你报仇！”说着他就昏过去了。
    打了一个多钟头，我们终于把那只机帆船打下海里去了。两艘炮艇也被我击伤，并击毙匪军六名（其中艇长一名），打伤十六名。
    当艇队胜利返港时，朱邦栋同志苏醒过来，问身旁的同志说：“怎么样？捉到敌人没有？”同志们安慰他说：“敌人的机帆船被我们打沉了。”
    这个年青的水兵安静地笑了。他喃喃自语道：“为了战斗的胜利，就是牺牲了自己也是值得的。”
