The broad masses of workers in Wuhan persisted in production during the flood season and exceeded the July production plan in many factories. The factories that completed the plan include: Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Hubei Farm Implement Factory, Hankou Auto Parts Factory, State-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, Wuchang No. 1 Yarn Factory, Yuhua Yarn Factory, Universe Tobacco Factory, Nanyang Tobacco Factory, Wuhan Chemical Factory, and Fuxin Flour Mill.

After Wuhan entered the emergency flood control stage, mechanical factories such as Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory dispatched their best technical workers and flood control equipment to support the flood control work. The factory sites of several yarn factories, such as the State-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, were located along the Yangtze River or along rivers and were directly threatened by floods. They all promptly repaired the dikes. Under these circumstances, the workers in each factory still came up with various ways to exceed the production plan. The workers of Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory tried to use old materials, waste materials, and turned-in materials for production, overcoming the difficulties in material supply during the flood season. At the same time, they also launched a technical innovation campaign, which enabled them to complete the entire month's production plan in twenty-eight days, and by the 30th, they had exceeded the plan by overhauling one locomotive. Because a large number of workers from the State-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill participated in flood control, the workforce in the workshops was reduced. However, inspired by the slogan "Increase Production by Fifty Pieces of Cotton Yarn to Support Flood Control" put forward by the Party Committee, the attendance rate and work efficiency of the workers were improved, and the increased production plan was successfully realized on the 30th.

    武汉市广大职工在防汛中坚持生产
    许多工厂超额完成上月生产计划
    武汉市许多工厂在防汛中坚持生产，超额完成了七月份生产计划。完成计划的工厂有：江岸机车车辆修理工厂、湖北农具厂、汉口汽车配件厂、国营武汉第一棉纺厂、武昌第一纱厂、裕华纱厂、宇宙烟厂、南洋烟厂、武汉化工厂和福新面粉厂等。
    在武汉市进入紧急防汛阶段后，江岸机车车辆修理工厂等机械厂，都抽调出最好的技术工人与防汛器材支援防汛工作，国营武汉第一棉纺厂等几个纱厂的厂址，都沿江或沿河，直接受洪水威胁，他们都及时地修了堤防。在这种情况下，各厂职工仍然想出各种办法，超额完成了生产计划。江岸机车车辆修理厂职工设法利用旧料、废料和上缴料进行生产，克服了汛期材料供应中的困难。同时他们还展开技术革新运动，使全月生产计划在二十八天中完成了，到三十日便超额检修了一台机车。国营武汉第一棉纺厂因为大批职工参加防汛，车间人力减少，但在党委会提出的“增产五十件棉纱支援防汛”的口号鼓舞下，职工出勤率与工作效率都有提高，在三十日便胜利地实现了增产计划。
