    A Major Victory for the Forces of Peace
    Maurice Kriegel-Valrimont
    Member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party

    July 20th and 21st, 1954, are unforgettable days. These are the days when the Indochina armistice agreement was signed in Geneva. People had anxiously awaited this great event. The French people hailed this event. Another fire that the warmongers were trying to expand has been extinguished. This is a great victory for the forces of peace.

    For France, an unjust war that had lasted for eight years has ended; this war was directed against people who were fighting for their independence, against cruel colonial enslavement, and who were tirelessly striving for peace and friendship with France.

    This war began on November 23, 1946, with the shelling of Haiphong by the "Suffren" warship; this event caused more than six thousand deaths. This event violated the agreement signed on March 6, 1946, which recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a free state and recognized the Ho Chi Minh government as the legitimate government, and it was another violation following a series of brutal breaches of contract. Despite the appalling suffering endured by the Vietnamese people, and despite the absurd slander of the Vietnamese government as a government "betraying" the motherland, the Vietnamese government continued to put forward peace proposals. From 1946 to 1954, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued dozens of communiqués, proposing many concrete peace suggestions. Ho Chi Minh's negotiation proposal last November aroused widespread response.

    The events of the past few years have shown that the movement of Asian peoples to win national independence is irresistible. The victory achieved by the great Chinese people has a huge impact on the national liberation struggles of hundreds of millions of people in Asia. It is clear that peaceful relations can be established with these countries as long as the legitimate rights of their people are respected.

    However, the colonialists stubbornly refused to recognize these obvious facts and continued the Indochina War. They actively participated in the plans of the American warmongers. Former French Air Force Commander-in-Chief in the Far East, General Chassin, revealed the goal of this mad strategy in a publication, saying that just one atomic bomb air raid would eliminate about 30 million Asians!

    Evil purposes are usually achieved by shameless means. Minister Letourneau (Popular Republican), who had commanded the French colonialists' adventurous acts for forty-four months, confessed to creating a new country in Indochina. This country found a worthy emperor – the despicable Bảo Đại. Accompanying this bloody adventure were endless scandals. Major scandals such as speculation using checks and piastres (Bảo Đại's Vietnamese currency) show that this country has been corrupted to an unbelievable degree, and it is this corruption that encouraged and supported such evil policies.

    For France, this was a terrible and intolerable policy. This policy first meant that not only were the much-suffering Vietnamese people dragged into a horrifying bloodbath, but also the French and African people were plunged into this horrifying bloodbath, as the colonialists sent French and African soldiers to Vietnam to fight against the people there. According to official estimates, 100,000 people have died in the expeditionary force, and 114,000 have been injured; among the dead soldiers were 2,000 officers and more than 6,000 non-commissioned officers. In this war of "major pointless sacrifice," as General René Cogny, one of the commanders of the expeditionary force, recently called it, the backbone of the French army suffered significant losses.

    According to the same official material, France has spent more than three trillion francs in this war; despite the talk of the "benevolence" of American aid, more than two-thirds of this military expenditure was borne by France alone. Looking at the situation in France, one can see how heavy a burden this military expenditure is.

    Therefore, it is very clear that this war is contrary to France's interests. Ending this war was a unanimous demand of the entire country. When the Geneva Conference opened, the universal desire for peace had become the firm will of the people. This will encouraged the forces of peace and finally drove the Bidault, Pleven, and the entire Laniel government from power, and put a premier in power who made resolving the Indochina peace issue his top priority. The struggle of the French and world people against the forces of war was decisively significant in promoting the Indochina armistice. ×××

    One can now see how large this struggle has grown in France, and how brilliant the achievements it has made. One can estimate how great a role the French Communist Party played as the party of the working class and as the leading force in the mass struggle. From the very beginning of this war, our Party has remained loyal to its principles and has served France and the cause of peace. Our Party has consistently and unswervingly remained loyal to its proletarian duties, exposing the injustice of the war against the Vietnamese people; the Party has tirelessly fought for peace, just as it has consistently strived for peace since its founding; the Party has always defended France's true interests and strived to eliminate France's pain and poverty.

    The French Communists can be proud of their Party's correct policy of striving to restore peace in Indochina, and our Party has unswervingly implemented this policy. Despite slander and frantic persecution, our Party has led the masses in action to implement this policy. In this struggle, it has been proven that our Party is a reliable guarantee of our country's future and is the deserved standard-bearer of democratic freedom and France. The masses of the people thank our Party for its struggle to restore peace in Indochina. This is one of the main reasons why more than five million French people supported our Party's program during the 1951 elections.

    The French working class massively participated in the mass political struggles called for by our Party.

    Dockworkers stood at the forefront of the battle to restore peace in Indochina, repeatedly refusing to load and unload munitions, and heroically expressed their will to fight for peace, regardless of significant sacrifice. Dockworkers in Marseille, Port-Vendres, Bordeaux, La Pallice, Bassens, Nantes, Rouen, Calais, Boulogne, and other French ports conducted struggles.

      The crews of the 'Pasteur', 'Lyon', and 'Belfort' also expressed their opposition to the Indochina War with actions.

    Railway workers in Bercy, La Chapelle, Vaugirard, Ivry in the Paris region, Nantes, Lyon, Brest, Saint-Pierre-des-Corps, and other transport hubs, all conducted active struggles to oppose this war.

    Metallurgical workers and workers in other industrial sectors, employees of the Renault factory and the Fives-Lille factory, factory employees in Toulouse, Grenoble, Nice, and many other industrial centers, have all earned reputations in this great struggle for peace.

    The working people in enterprises protested the Indochina War by means of writing petitions, marching demonstrations, and dispatching delegations; in response to the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the French General Confederation of Labour held a Peace Day on December 19, 1953.

    Because the working class carried out struggles, the working people in all walks of life united more widely, especially the Communist workers and Socialist workers. The number of joint actions taken by workers to strive for peace in Indochina increased.

    On July 23, Socialist workers, Communist workers, workers affiliated with the French General Confederation of Labour and "Workers' Force," and other patriots carrying the banners of their own organizations held a joint parade in Troyes to celebrate the restoration of peace in Indochina. If we remember that the right-wing Socialist Party leaders often voted in favor of war measures against Vietnam, then it is clear that this parade was the result of a vigorous effort to achieve unity. Guy Mollet even attempted to defend the Vietnam War with anti-communist slanders. However, the anti-war declaration issued by the recent Socialist Party Congress reflected the common will of the working people. Not long ago, after the government announced that it was preparing to transport new recruits to Indochina, Socialist Party workers and Communist Party workers had jointly held many parades and demonstrations. The development of unified action by the working class showed the increasing upsurge of the national struggle.

    In every people's movement, many exemplary figures always emerge. Léo Figuères, a member of our Party's Central Committee, was sentenced to seven years in prison for publishing a statement about the possibility of restoring peace in Vietnam after visiting Vietnam. He was forced to go underground, and now our people recognize him as a true defender of the people's wishes. We must unhesitatingly create conditions so that Léo Figuères can carry out normal, unobstructed activities.

    The heroic achievements of Henri Martin and Raymond Dien are well-known not only throughout France but also throughout the world. Due to the events of Jacques Duclos, Alain Le Leap, Guy Ducoloné, and others being arrested and imprisoned, our people have recognized the extent to which the ruling group has disregarded freedom and the barbaric acts that have been inflicted on the leaders of our Party, the French General Confederation of Labour, and youth organizations in order to continue this unjust war.

    It has been less than a year since Henri Martin, who was sentenced to hard labor, regained his freedom. The demand to revoke the parliamentary privileges of Communist leaders was rejected only at the end of last year. Unwavering struggles finally freed the imprisoned activists.

    Before peace was achieved in Indochina, the people had to struggle to defend the right to fight for peace. What happened later clearly showed that the "conspiracy" with which the peace fighters were charged was in fact the conspiracy of the likes of Pleven and Bidault against peace.

    Youth and youth organizations participated in all the people's struggles. French women also have a glorious place in this struggle. They supported the struggle of the working people. The touching parades and demonstrations held by the mothers of expeditionary soldiers and fallen soldiers were of great significance.

    After the National Farmers' Conference in 1952, farmers played a greater role in the struggle to restore peace in Indochina. At the farmers' conference held in the autumn of 1953 and in all farmers' movements, farmers powerfully expressed their will to oppose the Vietnam War.

    Intellectuals such as university professors, artists, writers, scientists, doctors, and lawyers increasingly powerfully expressed their positions, and they had repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Vietnam; literary works and artistic works also contributed to the people's struggle.

    The peace movement conducted effective activities in striving for peace in Vietnam. In recent years, meetings, marches, demonstrations, petitions, delegations, and the activities of peace committees in various places have helped to educate public opinion in our country, and have also helped to unite the French people more widely in order to restore peace in Vietnam.

    In this struggle, democratic forces and national forces have united more and more closely. In the committees striving for unity, for a ceasefire and peace in Vietnam, dozens of well-known figures have worked together with Communist activists, such as former Socialist Party ministers, Gaullist ministers, Radical Socialist Party members, Catholic writers, dissident writers, famous university professors, and senior military officers.

    It can be seen that the national demands that our Party has consistently put forward have been responded to and supported; with the help of all the forces of peace, the cause of peace has triumphed. ×××

    The restoration of peace in Indochina was able to be achieved because this was the wish of the people of all countries, and because the people of all countries had struggled for a ceasefire. This achievement was obtained in the face of strong pressure and conspiracies by the warmongers. From the recent Dien Bien Phu campaign onwards, delegations composed of people from all parts of our country went to Geneva to express the will of the French people. Workers, farmers, and people of different opinions and different occupations from all over the country held meetings and passed resolutions to tell the delegates attending the Geneva Conference of the demands of the French people. The travel expenses of the delegations were often raised through donations, and these delegations truly represented the vast majority of the French people.

    The actions of the people were a decisive factor in promoting a ceasefire in Indochina. The struggle of the people of all countries for peace once again demonstrated its strength. According to Mendes-France himself, this struggle
  "determined fate."

    The agreement reached in Geneva also proves that, in order to adopt an independent policy that conforms to national interests, France must get rid of the pressure and control of American imperialism. The Geneva Conference has confirmed that France is capable of getting rid of this pressure.

    Because there were repeated attempts to brutally "restrain" France before and during the Geneva Conference, the achievements of the Geneva Conference are even more significant. At that time, the warmongers were frantically preparing to expand the war and attempted to "internationalize" it. At that time, Bidault and his partners had secretly decided to allow the United States to conduct open and large-scale intervention, and they had pushed France to the edge of the abyss.

    Morton, an official of the U.S. State Department, arrogantly announced the desire of the United States to expand this war, saying, "The United States will not participate in an agreement reached on the basis of appeasement."

    The current Premier Mendes-France once said to Bidault: "Since 1950, just in order to get American subsidies, you have been trying to turn this drama being staged in Indochina, which should be localized in order to mitigate it as much as possible, into a theme that threatens world peace and causes serious disputes."

    The Geneva Conference showed that the American representatives did not give up their conspiracy to sabotage peace; their reservations about the agreements, their refusal to participate in the formulation of these agreements, and their publication of separate statements all exposed their vicious intentions.

    French politicians like Bidault and DuPont, who obey the orders of the White House, have exposed themselves as advocates of war. The Popular Republican Party is standing at the forefront of the supporters of war.

    In France, it is precisely in the struggle against these forces that we have seen very clearly that it is possible to resolve all disputes through consultation. But now, because there are various difficulties that must be overcome, especially because John Foster Dulles is still trying to piece together the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, we must be particularly vigilant and closely watch whether these agreements are being observed.

    It is possible for France to pursue an independent policy. France needs a program like the outline formulated by our Party's Thirteenth National Congress. Comrade Jacques Duclos pointed this out in his speech at the grand gathering at the Winter Velodrome on July 22. This extremely broad program stipulates: reducing military expenditure, reducing the term of military service to fifteen months, increasing wages and salaries, rapidly increasing the construction of housing, establishing new schools, and increasing teachers to improve children's education. In short, the main and immediate demands of the working people and all the people must be met. After the Indochina War ceases, the policy of suppressing the people of North Africa by force must be completely abandoned.

    Finally, the "European Defence Community" treaty must be rejected, and the serious threat to France – the rearmament of German revanchists – must be eliminated.

    The victory of the cause of restoring peace in Indochina demands more victories in the future; in order to win more victories, we must move forward along the road of unified action by the working class, because this is the prerequisite for uniting the democratic forces and national forces.

    This is the prospect that the Geneva Conference has opened up for France.

    Certain important aspects of this conference, which achieved a ceasefire in Indochina, have left an extremely profound impression on the entire French people: the great China sent a representative, Zhou Enlai, to attend this conference and played a major role; the participation of Chinese representatives in the international family of peace is absolutely necessary.

    In Geneva, the United Kingdom, represented by Eden, adopted a different attitude from the United States. Mendes-France expressed his gratitude to Eden; similarly, he also expressed his gratitude to V.M. Molotov, saying:
  "He worked hard to reconcile. At the last moment of the conference, his efforts were particularly successful." This conference particularly emphasized the decisive significance of the efforts made by the Soviet Union, a friend of peace and a friend of France.

    Therefore, changes have taken place in all aspects. First of all, the struggles carried out by the people have made a great contribution in this regard. As Maurice Thorez said in response to this matter, this struggle even affects the activities of the parliament and the government. The activities of the parliament and the government cannot but be affected, because in the final analysis, all these changes reflect the objective development of all sectors of society.

    We have taken the first step on the road to changing France's governing policy, and this is a decisive step.

    No one can justifiably say that what can be done in Asia cannot be done in Europe. If peace can be achieved in Asia through consultation, European security can also be guaranteed in the same way.

    A sentence that the honorary President of the National Assembly, Édouard Herriot, said in the past can also be read in "Le Monde" today: "Six months later, Molotov's collective security plan and opinions on the reunification and neutralization of Germany... will receive new responses." ×××

    We can conclude that our Party has gloriously completed its task in the struggle to stop the Indochina War. In carrying out the victorious people's struggle, our Party played a decisive role. It was precisely due to our Party's struggle and its vote in parliament that Bidault's subsequent downfall was decided. Our Party voted in favor of Mendes-France because we hoped to end the war. Our Party is currently strengthening the struggle to strive for peace, for the national independence and national progress demanded by the French people.

    How correct it seems today that the Communists harshly rebuked the pessimistic and despairing arguments of the enemies of the cause of peace and the people that France was destined to decline!

    As long as France can ensure its independence and serve the cause of peace, no one can stop it from once again playing a major role on the world stage.

    和平力量的重大胜利
    法国共产党  中央委员  莫里斯·克列埃日—瓦尔里蒙
    一九五四年七月二十日和二十一日是令人难忘的日子。这是印度支那停火协定在日内瓦签字的日子。人们曾焦急的盼望这一巨大事件。法国人民欢呼这一事件。战争煽动者力图扩大的又一片战火被扑灭了。这是和平力量的一个伟大胜利。
    对法国来说，一场进行了八年之久的非正义的战争结束了；这场战争的对象是为自己的独立、为反对残酷的殖民奴役而斗争的人民，是不倦地争取和平、争取与法国建立友谊的人民。
    这场战争是从一九四六年十一月二十三日“塞夫伦”号军舰炮击海防开始的；这一事件造成六千多人的死亡。这一事件违反了一九四六年三月六日签订的承认越南民主共和国为自由国家、承认胡志明政府为合法政府的协定，这是继一系列的粗暴的违约行为之后的又一违约行为。尽管越南人民经受了骇人听闻的苦难，尽管有人荒谬地诬蔑越南政府为“背叛”祖国的政府，越南政府还是不断地提出和平建议。从一九四六年到一九五四年，越南民主共和国曾经发表过几十次文告，提出许多具体的和平建议。去年十一月胡志明提出的谈判建议引起了广泛的响应。
    过去几年来发生的事件说明，亚洲各国人民争取民族独立的运动是不可抗拒的。伟大的中国人民所取得的胜利对于亚洲亿万人民的民族解放斗争有巨大的影响。很明显，只要尊重这些国家的人民的合法权利，就能和他们建立和平关系。
    但是，殖民者顽固地不肯承认这些明显的事实，并继续进行印度支那战争。他们积极地参与美国好战分子的计划。前法国驻远东空军总司令夏申将军在一个刊物上透露了这个疯狂战略的目标，他说，只要一次原子弹空袭就会消灭三千万左右的亚洲人！
    罪恶的目的通常总是用无耻的手段来达到的。曾经指挥法国殖民者的冒险行为达四十四个月之久的勒杜尔诺（人民共和党人）部长供认，在印度支那制造了一个新的国家。这个国家找到了相称的皇帝——可鄙的保大。伴随着这一血腥的冒险行为的是层出不穷的丑事。像利用支票和披阿士特（保大越南币）进行投机这一类大丑事，说明这个国家已经腐败到令人难以置信的地步，而正是这种腐败鼓励了并支持了这样的罪恶政策。
    对法国来说，这是一个可怕的、不可容忍的政策。这种政策首先意味着，不仅经历过许多苦难的越南人民被拖入怵目惊心的血泊里，而且由于殖民者把法国和非洲的军人送到越南去同那里的人民作战，法国人民和非洲人民也陷入了这一怵目惊心的血泊里。根据官方的估计，远征军中已经有十万人死亡，十一万四千人受伤；死亡的军人中有两千名军官和六千多名士官。在这一场如远征军司令官之一雷纳·戈涅将军最近所说的“重大的无谓牺牲”的战争中，法国军队的骨干遭到了重大的损失。
    根据同一官方材料，法国在这场战争中已经花费了三万亿以上的法郎；尽管大谈什么美援的“恩惠”，这笔军费的三分之二以上还是由法国独力负担的。看看法国的局势，就知道这笔军费是多么沉重的负担。
    因此，非常明显，这场战争和法国的利益是背道而驰的。结束这一战争是举国一致的要求。日内瓦会议开幕的时候，争取和平这一普遍愿望已经变成人民的坚定意志。这一意志鼓舞了和平力量，终于把皮杜尔、普利文和整个拉尼埃政府赶下台，而使一个把解决印度支那和平问题列为首要任务的总理当政。法国和全世界人民群众的斗争战胜了战争势力，这一斗争对于促成印度支那停火是具有决定性意义的。×××
    人们现在可以看出这一斗争在法国已经发展到多么大的规模，已经取得多么辉煌的成就。人们可以估量法国共产党作为工人阶级的政党、作为群众斗争的领导力量所起的作用是多么大。从这场战争爆发的最初时日起，我们党就一直忠于自己的原则，一直为法国与和平事业服务。我们党一贯毫不动摇地忠于自己的无产阶级职责，揭露对越南人民作战的非正义性；党不懈地为和平而斗争，正如它从成立之日起一贯为和平而努力一样；党一直维护法国的真正利益，竭力消除法国的痛苦和贫困。
    法国共产党人可以为自己的党的争取恢复印度支那和平的正确政策感到自豪，我们党坚持不渝地贯彻了这个政策。尽管遭到诽谤和疯狂的迫害，我们党还是在行动中领导群众执行这一政策。在这一斗争中，事实证明我们党是我国前途的可靠保证，是民主自由和法国的当之无愧的旗手。人民群众感谢我们党为恢复印度支那和平而进行的斗争。这是一九五一年选举期间有五百多万法国人拥护我们党的纲领的主要原因之一。
    法国工人阶级大规模地参加了我们党所号召的群众政治斗争。
    码头工人站在争取恢复印度支那和平的战斗的前列，他们一再拒绝装卸军火，并且不顾重大的牺牲，英勇地表示了他们争取和平的意志。马赛、文德勒港、波尔多、拉巴列斯、巴斯的亚、南特、卢昂、加莱、布伦以及其他法国港口的码头工人都进行了斗争。
      ‘巴士德’号、‘里昂’号和‘贝尔福’号的船员也用行动表示他们反对印度支那战争。
    贝尔西、拉夏培勒、弗吉拉德、巴黎区的伊夫列、南特、里昂、布勒斯特、圣比埃尔得柯尔和其他交通要津的铁路员工，都为反对这场战争进行了积极的斗争。
    冶金工人和其他工业部门的工人，雷诺工厂和里尔市菲夫工厂的员工，土鲁斯、格累诺布尔、尼斯以及其他许多工业中心的工厂员工，在这一伟大的争取和平的斗争中，都赢得了声誉。
    企业中的劳动人民采取写请愿书、游行示威、派遣代表团等方式抗议印度支那战争；为了响应世界工会联合会的号召，法国总工会在一九五三年十二月十九日举行了争取和平日。
    由于工人阶级进行了斗争，各行各业的劳动人民更广泛地团结起来了，特别是共产党工人和社会党工人团结起来了。工人们为争取印度支那和平而采取的联合行动的次数增多了。
    七月二十三日托叶的社会党工人、共产党工人、隶属于法国总工会和“工人力量”的工人以及其他打着自己团体的旗帜的爱国人士举行了一次联合大游行，庆祝印度支那恢复和平。如果我们还记得右翼社会党领袖经常投票赞成对越南采取战争措施的立场，那末很清楚，这次游行是大力争取团结的结果。居伊·摩勒甚至企图用反共的谰言来为越南战争辩护。但是最近举行的社会党代表大会所发表的反对战争的声明，却反映了劳动人民的共同意志。前不久，在政府宣布准备把新兵运往印度支那后，社会党工人和共产党工人曾经联合起来举行好多次游行示威。工人阶级统一行动的发展表明了全民斗争的日益高涨。
    在每一次人民的运动中，总是涌现出许多模范人物。我们党的中央委员利奥·斐盖尔，曾经因为在访问越南后发表了一篇关于在越南有可能恢复和平的声明而被判处了七年徒刑，他被迫转入地下，现在我国人民公认他是人民愿望的真正维护者了。我们必须毫不迟疑地创造条件，使利奥·斐盖尔能进行正常的、不受阻挠的活动。
    亨利·马丁和雷蒙德·第安的英雄业绩不仅闻名全法国，而且闻名全世界。由于雅克·杜克洛、阿兰·勒里普、居伊·杜科朗等人曾经被捕入狱这些事件，我国人民已经认识到统治集团为了要继续进行这个非正义的战争，藐视自由已经达到了何种地步，对我们党、法国总工会以及青年团体的领袖所施行的野蛮行为已经达到了何种地步。
    被判处苦役的亨利·马丁恢复自由还不到一年。取消共产党领袖的议员特权的要求遭到否决，还只是去年年底的事。坚持不渝的斗争终于使被监禁的活动家恢复了自由。
    在印度支那取得和平以前，人民不得不为争取保卫和平的权利进行斗争。后来发生的事情清楚地表明，和平战士们被控告的“阴谋”事实上正是普利文、皮杜尔之流反对和平的阴谋。
    青年和青年团体参加了人民的一切斗争。法国妇女在这一斗争中也有着光荣的地位。她们支持劳动人民的斗争。远征军兵士和阵亡兵士的母亲所举行的令人感动的游行示威具有重大意义。
    一九五二年全国农民会议举行以后，农民在争取恢复印度支那和平的斗争中发挥了更大的作用。在一九五三年秋天举行的农民大会上和一切农民运动中，农民都有力地表示了反对越南战争的意志。
    大学教授、艺术家、作家、科学家、医生和律师等知识分子越来越有力地表明了自己的立场，他们曾经多次呼吁越南停火；文学作品和艺术作品对于人民的斗争也作出了贡献。
    和平运动在争取越南和平方面进行了有效的活动。最近这几年，开会、游行示威、请愿、派遣代表团以及各地和平委员会的活动是有助于教育我国的舆论界的，同时也有助于为恢复越南和平而更广泛地团结法国人民。
    在这一斗争中，民主力量和民族力量越来越紧密地团结起来了。在争取团结、争取越南停火与和平的委员会中，跟共产党活动分子在一起工作的已经有好几十位著名人物，如前社会党部长、戴高乐派部长、激进社会党议员、天主教作家、不同见解的作家、著名的大学教授以及高级军官等。
    可见我们党一贯坚持提出的民族要求已经得到响应和拥护；在所有和平力量的帮助下，和平事业胜利了。×××
    恢复印度支那和平之所以能够实现，是因为这是各国人民的愿望，是因为各国人民都曾为停火进行过斗争。这种成就是在战争贩子施加强大压力和玩弄阴谋诡计的情况下获得的。从最近奠边府战役以来这一段时期，我国各地人民组成的代表团纷纷到日内瓦去表达法国人民的意志。全国各地的工人、农民以及不同见解和不同职业的人们纷纷举行会议，并通过决议把法国人民的要求告诉参加日内瓦会议的代表。代表团的旅费常常是靠募捐筹集的，这些代表团的确代表了绝大多数的法国人民。
    人民的行动是促使印度支那停火的一个决定性因素。各国人民争取和平的斗争又一次表现了它的力量。按照孟戴斯—弗朗斯自己的话，这一斗争
  “决定了命运”。
    在日内瓦达成的协议还证明，为了采取符合民族利益的独立政策，法国必须摆脱美帝国主义的压力和控制。日内瓦会议已经证实，法国是能够摆脱这种压力的。
    由于在日内瓦会议举行以前以及会议进行期间，有人屡次企图粗暴地对法国加以“约束”，因此，日内瓦会议的成就便更加具有重大的意义。当时，战争贩子在疯狂地准备扩大战争，企图使这场战争“国际化”。当时，皮杜尔及其伙伴们暗地里已经决定让美国进行公开的、大规模的干涉，他们曾把法国推到了深渊的边缘。
    美国国务院官员摩顿狂妄地宣布了美国力图扩大这场战争的愿望，他说，“美国不会参加根据姑息精神所达成的协议。”
    现任总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯曾对皮杜尔说：“从一九五○年起，只是为了得到美国的补助，你就一直企图把应该局部化以便尽可能使其缓和下来的这出在印度支那上演的戏变成威胁世界和平的、引起严重纠纷的主题。”
    日内瓦会议表明，美国代表并没有放弃他们破坏和平的阴谋；他们对于各协定提出保留，他们拒绝参加制订这些协定，他们发表单独声明，所有这些，都暴露了他们的恶毒意图。
    像皮杜尔、杜邦之流唯白宫之命是听的法国政客已经暴露了自己是主战派。人民共和党是站在战争拥护者的最前列的。
    在法国，正是在反对这些势力的斗争中，我们已经非常清楚地看到，通过协商的方式解决一切争端是可能的。但是在现在，由于存在着各种必须克服的困难，特别是由于约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯还在企图拼凑东南亚侵略集团，所以我们必须特别提高警惕，密切注视这些协定是否得到遵守。
    法国奉行独立的政策是可能的。法国需要一个像我们党第十三次代表大会所制订的提纲那样的纲领。七月二十二日雅克·杜克洛同志在冬季赛车场的盛大集会上发表的演说中已经指出了这一点。在这个极其广泛的纲领中规定着：削减军费，减少服兵役期限为十五个月，增加工资和薪金，迅速增建住宅，建立新学校、增加教师以改进儿童教育。总之，必须满足劳动人民和全体人民的主要的切身要求。在印度支那战争停止以后，还必须完全放弃用武力镇压北非人民的政策。
    最后，必须拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约，必须消除法国的严重威胁——重新武装德国复仇主义分子。
    恢复印度支那和平这一事业的胜利要求今后取得更多的胜利；为了赢得更多的胜利，必须沿着工人阶级统一行动的道路前进，因为这是团结民主力量和民族力量的先决条件。
    这就是日内瓦会议为法国展开的前景。
    使印度支那获致停火的这次会议的某些重要方面给予全体法国人民极为深刻的印象：伟大的中国派代表周恩来出席了这次会议，并起了重大的作用；在国际和平的大家庭中，中国代表的参加是完全必要的。
    在日内瓦，以艾登为代表的英国采取了与美国不同的态度。孟戴斯—弗朗斯向艾登表示感谢；同样，他也向维·米·莫洛托夫表示感谢，他说：
  “他努力进行和解。在会议的最后时刻，他的努力是特别成功的。”这次会议特别强调了和平之友和法国之友苏联所作的努力的决定性意义。
    因此，各方面发生了变化。首先，人民进行的斗争在这方面是有很大贡献的，如同莫里斯·多列士针对这件事所说的，这一斗争甚至影响到议会和政府的活动。议会和政府的活动是不能不受到影响的，因为归根到底，所有这些变化都反映了社会各阶层的客观发展。
    在改变法国施政方针的道路上，我们已经跨出了第一步，这是决定性的一步。
    谁也不能有根有据地说在亚洲做得到的事情在欧洲就做不到。如果通过协商的方式，可以获致亚洲的和平，欧洲的安全也可以用同样的方式来保障。
    国民议会名誉主席爱德华·赫里欧从前说过的一句话，今天我们在“世界报”上也可以读到了：“六个月以后，莫洛托夫的集体安全计划和关于重新统一中立化的德国的意见……将获得新的反响。”×××
    我们可以作出结论说，我们的党已经光荣地完成了它在争取停止印度支那战争的斗争中的任务。在开展胜利的人民斗争中，我们党起了决定性的作用。就是在议会中，也是由于我们党的斗争和党的投票，才决定了后来皮杜尔的下台。我们党投票赞成孟戴斯—弗朗斯，是因为我们希望结束战争。我们党目前正在加强斗争，争取和平、争取法国人民所要求的民族独立和国家的进步。
    共产党人过去严斥和平事业和人民的敌人关于法国注定要衰亡的那种悲观失望的论调，今天看来是何等的正确！
    只要法国能确保自己的独立并为和平事业服务，谁也不能阻止它再度在世界舞台上起重大的作用。
