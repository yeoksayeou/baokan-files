Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, with the assistance of the American aggressors, is intensifying its efforts to gather cannon fodder using various means, in order to rejuvenate its "old guard" troops that are about to lose their combat effectiveness.

In the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's plan, the first to suffer are the compatriots of Taiwan. During Van Fleet's three visits to Taiwan this year, the United States assisted Chiang Kai-shek in formulating a plan to establish so-called reserve forces, attempting to use Taiwanese youth to replace the old, weak, and disabled soldiers in the remaining bandit army. According to this plan, 500,000 Taiwanese compatriots will be forcibly conscripted into the Chiang bandit army, accounting for almost one-sixth of Taiwan's total population.

To realize this plan, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique recently revised the so-called "Military Service Law," stipulating the establishment of so-called "reserve soldiers." The Chiang bandit Ministry of National Defense openly admitted that the purpose of revising the military service law is to enable "those who have served for a long time to gradually retire… young men can join the camp for service." It is reported that the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan has reached a basic agreement with the Chiang bandits on using U.S. military aid to accelerate the training of this batch of reserve forces, with equipment and technical training provided by the United States.

According to the Associated Press, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique recently held a four-day so-called "general mobilization exercise" in Taiwan. In this exercise, a portion of the reserve forces composed of Taiwanese compatriots has already been incorporated into the formal army.

At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has strengthened military training for young students in Taiwan. University and college graduates are forced to receive training as so-called reserve officers. According to the Chiang bandit news agency, the students who recently graduated from the second class of the Chiang bandit Army Officer School's reserve officer training program were all graduates of various universities and colleges last year. More than one-third of this year's graduates will also be forced to receive this type of training. University and middle school students who are still in school are forced to participate in so-called "summer combat training teams." The purpose of this training is obviously to facilitate the immediate replenishment of these young people into the Chiang bandit army.

Another target for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's recruitment of cannon fodder is overseas Chinese youth. Under the pretext of "returning to Taiwan for further education," the Chiang bandits use methods such as "scholarships" and "travel subsidies" to lure overseas Chinese youth to Taiwan, and then incorporate them into the army. According to Taiwan newspapers, the special agent organization called "Mainland Disaster Relief General Association" alone has deceived more than 14,000 young people from Hong Kong, Macau, Pakistan, Vietnam, Burma, and other places in the past two years, many of whom have been forced to collectively join the Chiang bandit army. Recently, the Chiang bandits are also preparing to abduct more than 1,000 overseas Chinese students from the North Vietnam area to Taiwan. The American aggressors are also doing their best to assist in this regard. According to Hong Kong newspapers in July, the so-called "Association for Assistance to Intellectuals" in Hong Kong will soon recruit about 200 students in Hong Kong to transport them to Taiwan.

    蒋介石匪帮在美国协助下加紧搜罗炮灰
   【新华社二十六日讯】蒋介石卖国集团在美国侵略者的协助之下，正在用各种手段加紧搜罗炮灰，以便使它的将要丧失战斗力的“胡子兵”返老还童。
    在蒋介石卖国集团的计划中，首先遭殃的是台湾本地的同胞。在范佛里特今年三次访问台湾的时候，美国协助蒋介石拟订了一个建立所谓后备部队的计划，企图用台湾青年来替换残余匪军中的老弱残兵。根据这个计划，将有五十万名台湾同胞被强迫征入蒋匪军队，几乎占台湾全部人口的十六分之一。
    为了实现这个计划，蒋介石卖国集团最近修改了所谓“兵役法”，规定建立所谓“后备兵员”。蒋匪国防部公开承认，修改兵役法的目的是在使
  “服役已久者可逐渐退伍……青年男子可以入营服役”。据悉，在台湾的美国军事援助顾问团，已经和蒋匪就使用美国军事援助加速训练这批后备部队达致基本协议，装备和技术训练都将由美国提供。
    据合众社报道，蒋介石卖国集团最近在台湾举行了四天的所谓“总动员演习”，在这次演习中，已经有一部分由台湾同胞组成的后备部队被编为正式军队。
    蒋介石卖国集团同时加强了对台湾青年学生的军事训练。大学和专科学校毕业的学生被迫接受所谓预备军官的训练。据蒋匪通讯社透露，最近蒋匪陆军军官学校预备军官训练班第二期毕业的学生，全部是去年各大学、专科学校毕业的学生。今年毕业的学生中，也将有三分之一以上被迫接受这种训练。一般在学的大学和中学学生，则被迫参加所谓“暑期战斗训练队”。这种训练的目的，显然是为了便于随时将这些青年补充进蒋匪军队中去。
    蒋介石卖国集团搜罗炮灰的另一个对象是华侨青年。蒋匪以所谓“回台湾升学”为名，用“奖学金”、“补助旅费”等办法诱骗华侨青年前往台湾，然后将他们编入军队。据台湾报纸透露，仅蒋匪所谓“大陆灾胞救济总会”这一特务组织，两年来就从香港、澳门、巴基斯坦、越南、缅甸等地骗去青年一万四千多人，其中有许多人被迫集体参加蒋匪军队。最近蒋匪并准备从北越地区劫运一千多名华侨学生前往台湾。美国侵略者在这一方面也竭力加以协助。据香港报纸在七月间报道，美国在香港的所谓“援助知识人士协会”，将于最近在香港招收学生二百人左右运往台湾。
