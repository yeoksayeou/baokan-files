During the congress, the delegates, in accordance with the instructions in the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram, fully discussed the tasks of the trade union work in the future and exchanged experiences in trade union work.

The congress determined that the central task of the trade union in the future is to strengthen enterprise management in coordination with the administration, carry out the technical innovation movement, and further improve the labor emulation drive. The congress believes that carrying out the technical innovation movement is consistent with the current strengthening of technical management in enterprise administration. The purpose of strengthening technical management is to innovate the old technical standards and operating procedures, further establish a normal production order, and in this work process, it is necessary for the workers to use their brains and actively put forward rationalization proposals to promote the development of the mass technical innovation movement; and the results of carrying out the technical innovation movement must also be consolidated by improving technical standards and operating procedures, which in turn promotes the advancement of technical management. The two are closely linked and mutually guaranteed. The congress pointed out that carrying out the technical innovation movement is to organize labor emulation drives with technical innovation as the main content to ensure the completion and over-completion of the national plan; in new factories and mines, the main task is to learn technology, master new machines and equipment, and continuously improve technical proficiency.

The congress determined that systematically strengthening the political, technical, and cultural education of workers and staff is a regular task of the trade union; and on the basis of strengthening the political and ideological education of workers and staff, to continue to consolidate labor discipline, in order to improve the organization and discipline of the vast number of workers and staff. The congress also pointed out that trade union workers must correctly handle the relationship between production and life, and must gradually improve the lives of workers and staff on the basis of increasing production; economism must be opposed, and bureaucracy that does not care about the lives of workers and staff must also be opposed. The congress determined that it is necessary to strengthen trade union construction and further establish a normal order of trade union work to ensure the smooth progress of the above-mentioned tasks. Finally, the congress also stipulated that the trade union work in private enterprises must implement the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation to guide private enterprises onto the road of state capitalism.

Finally, the congress adopted a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers. It also passed resolutions supporting the diplomatic report of Zhou Enlai, Premier and concurrently Foreign Minister of the Central People's Government, the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee on approving Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report, and the joint declaration of various democratic parties and people's organizations in China for the liberation of Taiwan. The resolution stated that all workers and staff in the heavy industry are determined to fight for the completion of the sacred task of liberating Taiwan with practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy!

    重工业工会全国代表大会闭幕
    中国重工业工会第一次全国代表大会二十三日下午胜利闭幕。大会选出了赵国强、高崇智、江浩然、袁子和、石磊、孟泰等五十五人为第一届全国委员会的委员，张国华等十五人为候补委员，李启新等五人为经费审查委员。中国重工业工会第一届全国委员会正式宣告成立。
    大会期间，代表们按照党中央贺电中的指示，充分讨论了今后工会工作的任务，并交流了工会工作的经验。
    大会确定今后工会的中心工作是：协同行政加强企业管理，开展技术革新运动，把劳动竞赛提高一步。大会认为开展技术革新运动和目前企业行政方面加强技术管理是一致的。加强技术管理的目的就是要对旧的技术标准、操作规程进行革新，进一步建立正常生产秩序，在这一工作过程中需要职工群众开动脑筋，积极提合理化建议，推动群众性的技术革新运动的开展；而开展技术革新运动的成果，也必须要以改进技术标准、操作规程来巩固，这又推动技术管理的前进。二者是紧密联系，互相保证的。大会指出：开展技术革新运动就是要以技术革新为主要内容去组织劳动竞赛，保证完成和超额完成国家计划；在新建厂矿中，主要是学习技术，掌握新机器、新设备，不断地提高技术熟练程度。
    大会确定有系统地加强职工政治、技术和文化教育，是工会的经常任务；并在加强职工政治思想教育的基础上，继续巩固劳动纪律，以提高广大职工的组织性和纪律性。大会还指出，工会工作者必须正确地处理生产和生活的关系，必须在增加生产的基础上逐步改善职工生活；经济主义的倾向必须反对，不关心职工生活的官僚主义也必须反对。大会确定要加强工会建设，进一步建立工会工作的正常秩序，以保证上述各项工作的顺利进行。最后，大会还规定在私营企业中的工会工作，必须贯彻利用、限制和改造的方针，引导私营企业走上国家资本主义的道路。
    大会最后通过了向毛主席、中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军的致敬电。并通过拥护中央人民政府周恩来总理兼外交部部长的外交报告、中央人民政府委员会关于批准周恩来的外交报告的决议、中国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言的决议。决议中表示，重工业全体职工决心以增产节约的实际行动，为完成解放台湾的神圣任务而奋斗！
