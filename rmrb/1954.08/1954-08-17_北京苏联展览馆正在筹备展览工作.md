    Beijing Soviet Exhibition Hall is Preparing for Exhibition Work
    The construction of the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Hall is about to be completed, and various preparations for the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition have also begun.

    In front of the central hall, the national emblems of the sixteen Soviet republics have been hung on the sixteen large arches. Paint workers are applying the third coat of silver paint to the sixteen flagpoles. Welders and pipe workers are welding and laying water pipes in the large fountain pool in front of the hall. Green trees and exotic flowers and plants have surrounded part of the building. The "steppe oats" transported by plane from Moscow have grown more than two inches high, forming a green meadow. The open-air theater, which was the last to be built, is beginning to decorate the stage and prepare for the installation of seats. In the magnificent industrial hall, an installation team composed of more than 280 Chinese technicians and technical workers is installing industrial exhibits. As of August 13, more than 90% of the exhibits shipped from the Soviet Union to Beijing have arrived. Workers in many printing factories in Beijing are printing 238 kinds of machine sample instruction manuals for the exhibition. Approximately one million words of exhibition descriptions are being written. Two hundred and fifty instructors have already begun intensive training on the 10th.

    After the opening of the exhibition, it is estimated that 40,000 people will visit every day. The Beijing Municipal People's Government is trying to solve problems such as transportation and meals. A concrete road from Fuchengmen directly to the Soviet Exhibition Hall is expected to be completed by the end of August. The Beijing Municipal People's Government Commercial Bureau and other units are preparing to build a comprehensive shopping mall opposite the exhibition hall, which will have restaurants, tea rooms, and places to sell books and newspapers, to serve visitors.
