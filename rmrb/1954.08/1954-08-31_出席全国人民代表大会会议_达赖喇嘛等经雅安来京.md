Xinhua News Agency, Ya'an, 30th — The Dalai Lama and other representatives from the Tibetan region, en route to Beijing to attend the National People's Congress meeting, arrived in Ya'an on August 28th after a long journey. Accompanying the Dalai Lama were his tutor, Living Buddha Lingtsang, his deputy tutor, Living Buddha Trijang, Kalon Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme of the Tibetan local government, the Dalai Lama's mother, the Dalai Lama's sister Jetsun Pema, and acting Chikhyap Khenpo Lobsang Tsanden. Among them, Living Buddha Trijang, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and Jetsun Pema are all deputies to the National People's Congress.

General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government and also a deputy to the National People's Congress, accompanied the Dalai Lama to Beijing.

Liao Zhigao, Chairman of the People's Government of Xikang Province, Vice Chairman Xiake Daodeng, Deputy Political Commissar of the Xikang Military Region Gao Dexi, and more than 300 representatives from various people's organizations, democratic parties, and government departments were at the station to welcome them.

After the Dalai Lama and General Zhang Jingwu alighted from the car, they shook hands with the welcoming crowd and accepted flowers from the Young Pioneers of Ya'an City. The Dalai Lama, despite the long journey, appeared healthy, happy, and all smiles. That day, the People's Government of Xikang Province held a banquet and evening party for the Dalai Lama and his party, as well as General Zhang Jingwu. At the party, Liao Zhigao delivered a welcoming speech. He said that Xikang and Tibet are adjacent to each other and have a profound relationship in politics, economy, culture, and religion. In the past few years, Xikang and Tibet have followed Chairman Mao's policy on nationalities, helping each other and working together, and have achieved significant success in various tasks. In the future, they will certainly unite more closely within the unified family of the motherland, adhere to the principles of unity, progress, and further development, learn from each other, and gradually transition to a socialist society.

In his reply, the Dalai Lama expressed his gratitude with immense pleasure for the warm welcome and cordial hospitality of the people of Xikang. He said that in the few years since the liberation of Xikang and Tibet, significant achievements have been made in various tasks. The Kangzang Highway, which will soon be open to traffic in Lhasa, has received strong support from the people of all ethnic groups in Xikang during its construction. In addition to expressing our heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and the great leader Chairman Mao, we also thank the people of all ethnic groups in Xikang. The Dalai Lama concluded by saying: "The first session of the First National People's Congress is about to be convened, which is an unprecedented and joyous event in the history of the people of the whole country and also the people of Tibet. I feel extremely honored to be able to attend this meeting as a representative of the Tibetan region."

General Zhang Jingwu also spoke at the meeting. He congratulated the people of all ethnic groups in Xikang Province on their achievements in various constructions and expressed his gratitude to the people of all ethnic groups in Xikang Province for their strong support to the troops entering Tibet over the past few years and for their warm welcome and hospitality this time.

The Dalai Lama and his tutors stayed in a building with a scripture hall. His bedroom and scripture hall were decorated according to Tibetan customs.

The Dalai Lama visited the state-owned Xinduqiao Farm in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province and was very excited to see that tractors and other new agricultural tools had begun to be used on the Kangzang Plateau.

On August 29th, the Dalai Lama and General Zhang Jingwu and others left Ya'an for Chengdu. Representatives of various departments stationed in Ya'an City went to see them off in the rain.
