    Primary and junior high school graduates in rural areas of Jiangsu Province participating in agricultural production have become an important force on the agricultural production front. In 1953, seven counties including Nantong, Jiangdu, Yancheng, Jianhu, Shuyang, Jintan, and Dangshan had more than 16,000 primary school graduates. Except for a portion who entered middle school and a few who took up other jobs, more than 7,400 participated in agricultural production. All 987 primary school graduates in Jianhu County who have participated in agricultural production since 1950 have become active members in rural production, politics, and cultural activities. In Zhaotun Village, Feng County, fourteen primary school graduates took the lead this spring in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and promoted the organization of fifteen mutual aid groups in the whole village, and some were even elected as mutual aid group leaders. Zhang Shenli, a junior high school student at the Wuxi County Five-Star Agricultural Production Cooperative, combined production experience with book knowledge and has summarized and promoted more than 60 agricultural techniques in the past two years, and was rated as a production technician by the entire cooperative. Zhu Quan'gen, a fifteen-year-old primary school graduate at the Qingpu County Cangyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative, learned how to use water pumps and harvest wheat in just one year, and also raised an ox to be particularly strong, and was elected as a labor model by the entire cooperative. Xu Guoqiang, a primary school graduate in the suburbs of Xuzhou, produced during the day and insisted on teaching at night, eliminating illiteracy for more than 100 farmers, and became a people's school teacher respected by the farmers. Many primary and junior high school graduates have become heads of agricultural production cooperatives, production team leaders, accountants, work recorders, and village cadres, and some have even been elected as people's representatives.
    With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the demand for primary and junior high school graduates on the agricultural production front is even greater. The Xiji Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yancheng County currently needs more than 30 accounting personnel and agricultural technicians. Among the four primary school graduates who came to work in this cooperative last year, three have already served as work recorders for the production team. Primary and junior high school graduates participating in agricultural production in various places have also received education and training from relevant parties. Some have also joined the Communist Party of China and the New Democratic Youth League.

    江苏省参加农业生产的高小和初中毕业生
    已成为农业生产中的重要力量
    江苏省各地农村参加农业生产的高小毕业生和初中毕业生已成为农业生产战线上一支重要力量。南通、江都、盐城、建湖、沭阳、金坛、砀山等七个县一九五三年有高小毕业生一万六千多人，除一部分升入中学和少数参加其他工作外，有七千四百多人参加了农业生产。建湖县一九五零年以来参加农业生产的九百八十七个高小毕业生，都成为农村生产和政治、文化活动中的积极分子。丰县十一区赵屯村十四个高小毕业生今春在互助合作运动中带头和推动全村农民组织了十五个互助组，有的还当选为互助组长。无锡县五星农业生产合作社初中学生张申立把生产经验和书本知识结合起来，两年来总结和推广了农业技术六十多种，被全社评为生产技术员。青浦县仓园农业生产合作社十五岁的高小毕业生朱泉根在短短的一年中学会使用戽水机和割麦等技术，还把一头耕牛养得特别健壮，被全社选为劳动模范。徐州市郊区高小毕业生徐国强白天生产，晚上坚持教学，扫除了一百多个农民文盲，成为农民们敬爱的民校教师。很多高小和初中毕业生成为农业生产合作社的社长、生产队长、会计、记工员和乡村干部，有的还被选为人民代表。
    随着互助合作运动的发展，农业生产战线上需要高小和初中毕业生的数量更大。盐城县西季农业生产合作社目前就需要三十多个会计人员和农业技术人员。去年到这个社工作的四个高小毕业生中，已有三人担任了生产队的记工员。各地参加农业生产的高小和初中毕业生还得到有关方面的教育培养。有的还参加了中国共产党和新民主主义青年团。　（新华社）
