    Chongqing's broad masses of women are actively participating in discussions on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. In five districts, the percentage of women participating in the discussions reached 80 to 90 percent. Women in suburban rural areas, where discussions started later, are also squeezing out time from the busy farming season to participate, generally having discussed the draft two to five times.

    The Chongqing Democratic Women's Federation attaches great importance to mobilizing women to participate in discussions on the Draft Constitution. Women's federations in various districts have adopted methods such as running training classes and holding women's representative conferences to train a large number of female propaganda backbones. Women representatives in streets and suburban villages are also actively organizing women to carry out various types of small-scale discussion activities. The No. 1 Zhongyi Road police station women's representative conference in the First District separately convened discussion meetings attended by workers' families, elderly women, and women from the industrial and commercial sectors. The Second, Third, and Fifth Districts convened discussion meetings attended by female township heads, female cooperative chairpersons, female mutual aid team leaders, female activists, and female people's representatives. Many areas also used women's literacy classes, newspaper reading groups, and other organizations to mobilize women to participate in discussions. The women of Jintang Street police station organized a temporary baby-holding group, allowing mothers to participate in discussion meetings with peace of mind.

    Women are very excited to be able to participate in discussions on the nation's fundamental law. Hu Gaoyu, an old woman in her seventies, said: "It was not easy for us women to be able to participate in discussions on the nation's fundamental law, and I cannot give up this right." At the discussion meetings, they spoke very enthusiastically. In the third group of the fourth section of Longmen Xiahao in the Fifth District, twenty-three women participated in the discussion, of whom twenty spoke; when the hour and a half discussion time was up, some women asked to continue the discussion. Many women put forward suggestions for revising the Draft Constitution. The discussion of the Draft Constitution has stimulated women's enthusiasm for building a socialist society. After discussing the Draft Constitution, many women in mutual aid teams in suburban rural areas further realized that implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture is the only way for rural women to achieve liberation, and they have asked to join agricultural producers' cooperatives one after another. After participating in the discussion on the Draft Constitution, Pan Sugu, a female representative from Tangjiatuo in the Second District, increased her enthusiasm for labor and promptly mobilized the members of the mutual aid team to catch more than 70,000 locusts. Guo Mingyu, a family member of a worker constructing the Kangzang Highway, realized that the unity of all ethnic groups is one of the important conditions for realizing a socialist society. She criticized her past mistaken idea of not allowing her husband to work in the Kang, Tibetan minority areas, and wrote a letter to encourage her husband to build the highway even better. Wang Bingruo, a security committee member from Xuetianwan, and others, in the discussion of the Draft Constitution, paid special attention to the fact that protecting public property is a glorious obligation of every citizen. Recently, when the river rose, they mobilized more than 100 residents to help the repair station rush to transport wood piled on the riverbank.

    重庆市广大妇女积极参加宪法草案的讨论
    重庆市广大妇女群众积极参加中华人民共和国宪法草案的讨论活动。有五个区参加讨论的妇女达到百分之八十到九十；开展讨论较迟的郊区农村妇女也挤出农忙时间参加了讨论，一般已讨论了二次到五次。
    重庆市民主妇女联合会对发动妇女参加宪法草案的讨论非常重视。各区妇女联合会采取办训练班和召开妇女代表会等方式，训练了大批妇女宣传骨干。街道和郊区乡村的妇女代表也积极组织妇女展开各种类型的小型讨论活动。第一区中一路派出所妇女代表会分别召开了工人家属、老婆婆、工商界妇女参加的讨论会。第二、三、五等区召开了女乡长、女社长、女互助组长、妇女积极分子及女人民代表等参加的讨论会。许多地区还利用妇女识字班、读报组等组织发动妇女进行讨论。金汤街派出所的妇女们组织了临时抱娃娃组，使母亲们安心地参加讨论会。
    妇女们对自己能够参加讨论国家的根本大法感到非常兴奋。一个七十多岁的老太婆胡高玉说：
  “我们妇女能够参加讨论国家根本大法，这权利得来不容易，我不能放弃这个权利。”在讨论会上，她们发言很踊跃。第五区龙门下浩第四段三组有二十三个妇女参加讨论，其中有二十人发了言；一个半钟头的讨论时间到了，有些妇女还要求继续讨论下去。许多妇女对宪法草案提出了修改的意见。宪法草案的讨论，激发了妇女建设社会主义社会的热情。郊区农村许多互助组的妇女在宪法草案讨论后，进一步体会到实行农业社会主义改造是农村妇女争取解放的唯一道路，纷纷要求参加农业生产合作社。第二区唐家沱妇女代表潘素国参加讨论宪法草案以后，提高了劳动热情，及时发动了互助组组员，捕捉了害虫蚱蜢七万多只。修筑康藏公路的工人家属郭明玉认识到各民族的团结是实现社会主义社会的重要条件之一，她批判了自己过去不让丈夫去康、藏少数民族地区工作的错误思想，并写信去鼓励她丈夫把公路修得更好。学田湾治安委员王冰若等在宪法草案讨论中，特别注意到爱护公共财产是每个公民的光荣义务的一条，最近在江水上涨时，她们动员了一百多个居民，帮助修缮站抢运了堆在江边的木材。
