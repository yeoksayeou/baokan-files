Collective Peace, Not Opposing Military Blocs
　　Wu Quan

    The United States is using every despicable means to put together a Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and is attempting to drag countries participating in the Colombo Conference into the water. However, their situation is not good, as major Southeast Asian countries have refused to participate in the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and advocate for the establishment of collective peace.

    More and more facts show that the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group" planned by the United States is a military aggressive organization that takes China as its main target of aggression, undermines peace in Southeast Asia, and creates new wars. The formation of this bloc will make the implementation of the Geneva Accords on the restoration of peace in Indochina subject to destruction. At the same time, it will create an atmosphere of division and hostility between Asian countries, facilitating the United States' implementation of the vicious scheme of "using Asians to fight Asians."

    In order to conceal the aggressive nature of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, the American planners of this bloc are desperately clamoring about the so-called "threat of communist aggression," insisting that the restoration of peace in Indochina "has greatly increased the danger of communist subversion in neighboring Southeast Asian countries," attempting to make Southeast Asian countries believe that the People's Republic of China's peaceful diplomatic policy threatens their security. But this clumsy ghost story can no longer deceive anyone. The contributions made by the People's Republic of China at the Geneva Conference for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the Indochina issue, as well as its joint statement with India and Burma announcing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, irrefutably prove that the People's Republic of China has been, is now, and will be loyal to its consistent diplomatic policy of safeguarding peace and developing friendly relations with all countries.

    Conversely, it is the United States that is piecing together opposing military blocs in Asia, pursuing aggressive policies and war policies, threatening peace in Asia, and primarily threatening the security of participating countries. A Reuters dispatch from London on August 9 also pointed out that the reason why the United States is eager to form this bloc is to "complete a missing link in the system of military alliances" "surrounding the non-communist world." The dispatch also said that "the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization will be a military alliance built entirely in imitation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, stipulating that its member states have the obligation to take automatic military action in the event of aggression (should read as American aggression) within its included region."

    Australian Prime Minister Menzies, who followed the United States in advocating the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, also revealed at a press conference on August 6 that the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc "may require signatory countries to provide troops," and Australian troops "may have to be stationed in this region." A Reuters dispatch on August 9 also stated that if Pakistan joins the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, "the geographical resources of East Pakistan, especially Chittagong, will be placed under the control of the Southeast Asia Alliance (actually the United States)." Therefore, what exactly the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" is, and what kind of harm those countries participating in this organization will suffer, can be imagined.

    Not only that, the United States is also trying its best to drag Laos, Cambodia, and Bao Dai's Vietnam into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, designating them as the so-called "protected areas" of this bloc. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles publicly said on August 6 that it is necessary to "draw a line along the northern edge of Burma, and include all of Laos and Cambodia, and the part of Vietnam south of the 17th parallel demarcation line." This clearly exposes that the United States is still attempting to undermine the Indochina armistice agreement, create trouble in this region, and prevent stable peace in Indochina.

    This proves more clearly that the United States' plan to put together the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, like its conspiracy to establish military blocs in other regions, is pursuing war, infringing upon the independent sovereignty of various countries, and using others as pawns. It is obviously very difficult for the American planners of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to dress themselves up as "apostles of peace" and make people believe that it is unreliable to establish collective peace, and that only by following this self-proclaimed "apostle of peace" can security be guaranteed.

    Peaceful coexistence and friendship between countries are the ardent demands of the people of the world, especially the people of Asia and Europe. This is a significant trend in international relations, and British officials have also seen this trend, knowing that it is in line with Britain's interests. Therefore, such claims can often be seen in their public speeches. It is right for Britain to adhere to the Geneva Accords on Indochina and oppose the participation of the three Indochinese countries in military alliances. However, on the other hand, the British government has accepted American pressure and supported the organization of the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty or Southeast Asia Defense Group, which is aimed at being hostile to China and endangering peace in Asia. This contradictory position of the British government is difficult to understand. Indian Prime Minister Nehru once pointed out that peace cannot exist in constant war preparations and war threats. This is the reason why many peace-loving Asian countries and people do not want opposing military blocs, but want collective peace.

    The plan of the American ruling group to piece together the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc is becoming increasingly notorious. But it is still shamelessly trying to make this plan appear as a so-called "common cause" of Southeast Asian countries, attempting to eliminate the stench of imperialism and colonialism that permeates this plan; at the same time, it is doing everything possible to drag Southeast Asian countries into the water, "persuading" them to send "observers" to participate in the meeting to put together this aggressive bloc even if they do not formally participate, or to act as "associate member states," or at least to maintain "contact" with this bloc or express "sympathy" for it. Recently, the American ruling group has also trotted out a so-called "Asian Marshall Plan" as a means of inducement. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on August 8, "American officials say they are convinced that if they want to gain Asian sympathy for security arrangements (i.e., aggressive blocs), the emphasis in Southeast Asia must be placed on the economic aspect." A dispatch from the same news agency on August 6 also stated: "The United States and Britain believe that the economic part of this proposed treaty may" be "attractive" to some Southeast Asian countries. However, American propagandists cannot hide their fox tails at all, admitting that this "economic plan" is to be implemented "under the protection of the military security guarantees provided" by the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and to gradually drag countries that accept "American aid" into the aggressive bloc.

    Therefore, all these means of the United States only serve to expose the sinister intentions hidden in the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc even more, arousing greater vigilance and widespread opposition from the Asian people. Now, countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon have all expressed their unwillingness to participate in this aggressive bloc and refused to have anything to do with it. In a speech on August 4, Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated that Asian countries should not be forced to do anything under any foreign pressure and foreign influence. "I hope that Asian countries will cooperate with each other in the affairs of building a new Asia." Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo also stated on August 10 that Indonesia will not participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and will not send observers to attend the meeting to discuss the establishment of the Southeast Asia bloc. Rendumo U, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Indonesian Parliament, also emphasized: "We will not participate in the struggle against so-called communist aggression. Indonesia will steadfastly pursue an independent policy."

    As a result, the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group" only has some countries in Southeast Asia, such as Thailand and the Philippines, participating, and the positions taken by the ruling groups of these countries neither represent the people of Southeast Asia nor completely violate the will of their domestic people and their national interests. Even Philippine Senate Defense Committee Chairman Recto opposes the Philippines' participation in the Southeast Asia bloc. He said that among the countries in Asia, only the Philippines and Thailand have expressed their willingness to participate in the Southeast Asia bloc, so these two countries in the Southeast Asia bloc will inevitably be completely obedient to the decisions of non-Asian countries.

    In Southeast Asia and Asian countries, it is not the military blocs of division and confrontation created by the United States, but the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that are increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The restoration of peace in Indochina has proved that these principles can be applied to relations between countries and general international relations, and that these principles can be used to promote negotiated solutions to all problems, thereby establishing a region of collective peace and eliminating the threat of war. Those outdated arguments that are being promoted, such as only relying on the United States' military force and so-called "American aid" can one stand, are no longer worth a penny. People are very clear that countries tied to the American chariot cannot talk about their peace and security or their economic interests at all; on the contrary, only the establishment of collective peace and the development of equal and mutually beneficial economic relations between countries can enable Asian countries to enjoy the benefits of peace.

    Now, the United States is still stubbornly going its own way, and even announced on August 14 its decision to hold a meeting with its allies in Baguio, Philippines, on September 6 to establish the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. This requires the people of the world and all countries willing to coexist peacefully to work harder to safeguard peace, so that the United States' policy of dividing Asia and creating war will suffer even greater setbacks.

### 要集体和平，不要对立的军事集团

    要集体和平，不要对立的军事集团
  　吴全
    美国正在用尽一切卑劣手段，来拼凑东南亚侵略集团，并企图把参加科伦坡会议的国家拖下水。但是，它们的景况很不佳，主要的东南亚国家都拒绝参加东南亚侵略集团，主张建立集体的和平。
    愈来愈多的事实表明，美国所策划的所谓“东南亚防御集团”彻头彻尾是一个以中国为主要的侵略目标，破坏东南亚和平，制造新战争的军事性侵略组织。这一集团的组成，将使日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议的实施有遭到破坏的可能，同时，它将在亚洲各国之间造成分裂和敌对的气氛，便利美国推行“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的恶毒计谋。
    东南亚侵略集团的美国策划者为了掩盖这一集团的侵略实质，拚命叫嚣所谓“共产党侵略的威胁”，硬说印度支那和平的恢复，“已大大地增加了共产党在邻近的东南亚国家中进行颠覆活动的危险”，企图使东南亚各国相信，中华人民共和国的和平外交政策威胁到它们的安全。但是这种笨拙的鬼话，早已骗不了什么人。中华人民共和国在日内瓦会议中为和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题所作的贡献，以及它和印、缅两国分别宣布和平共处的五项原则的联合声明，都无可辩驳地证明了中华人民共和国在过去、现在和将来都忠于它所一贯奉行的保卫和平，发展各国友好关系的外交政策。
    与此相反，正是美国在亚洲拼凑对立的军事集团，推行侵略政策和战争政策，威胁着亚洲的和平，并且首先威胁到各参加国家的安全。路透社八月九日从伦敦发出的电讯也曾指出，美国所以急于要组成这个集团，是为了“完成环绕非共产主义世界”的“军事联盟体系中所缺少的一个环节”。这条电讯并说，“东南亚公约组织将是完全模仿北大西洋公约组织而建立的一种军事联盟，规定它的成员国在它所包括的地区之内万一发生侵略（应读作美国侵略）时有自动采取军事行动的义务。”
    追随美国鼓吹东南亚侵略集团的澳大利亚总理孟席斯也在八月六日记者招待会上透露，东南亚侵略集团“可能要求签字的国家都提供军队”，澳大利亚的军队就“可能要驻在这个地区内”。路透社八月九日的消息并称，如果巴基斯坦参加东南亚侵略集团，“东巴基斯坦的地理资源，特别是吉大港，将置于东南亚联盟（实即美国）的支配之下”。因此，“东南亚公约组织”究竟是什么东西，那些参加这个组织的国家将要受到什么损害，可以想见了。
    不仅如此，美国还正在竭力要把老挝、柬埔寨和保大越南拖进东南亚侵略集团中去，把它们划为这个集团的所谓“保护地区”。美国国务卿杜勒斯八月六日就公然说，要“沿缅甸的北缘划一道线，把老挝和柬埔寨的全部，越南在北纬十七度分治线以南的部分划进在内。”这清楚地暴露了美国仍在企图破坏印度支那停战协定，在这个地区制造祸端，不让印度支那有稳定的和平。
    这就再清楚不过地证明美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团的计划，正和它在其他地区建立军事集团的阴谋目的一样，是在追求战争，侵犯各国独立主权，并借刀杀人。东南亚侵略集团的美国策划者要把自己打扮成“和平使徒”，使人相信建立集体和平靠不住，只有跟着这个自命的“和平使徒”走，才能保障安全，显然是很困难的事了。
    和平共处，各国友好，是世界人民，特别是亚洲人民和欧洲人民的热烈要求，这是国际关系中的显著趋势，英国当政人士也已经看到了这种趋势，知道这是符合于英国的利益的。因此在他们的公开言论中也常常可以看到这种主张。英国坚守日内瓦会议关于印度支那的协议，反对印度支那三国参加军事联盟，这是对的。但是，另一方面，英国政府却又接受美国的压力，支持组织旨在敌视中国，危害亚洲和平的所谓东南亚公约或东南亚防御集团。英国政府的这种矛盾立场，很难令人理解。印度总理尼赫鲁曾经指出，和平不能在经常的战争准备和战争威胁中存在。这就是许多亚洲爱好和平的国家和人民不要对立的军事集团，而要集体和平的原因。
    美国统治集团拼湊东南亚侵略集团的计划，日益声名狼藉。但它依然恬不知耻地竭力想使这个计划显得像东南亚国家的一项所谓“共同事业”，企图消除这个计划充满着的帝国主义和殖民主义的臭味；同时，并千方百计地企图拖东南亚国家下水，
  “劝诱”它们如果不正式参加也要派“观察员”参加拼凑这个侵略集团的会议，或作为“准会员国”，再不然也要对这个集团保持“联系”或者表示“同情”等等。最近，美国统治集团还搬出了一个所谓
  “亚洲的马歇尔计划”来作为诱骗手段。据合众社华盛顿八日电，“美国官员们说，他们深信：如果要获得亚洲人对安全安排（即侵略集团）的同情，在东南亚的重点必须放在经济方面”。这个通讯社六日电并称：“美国和英国认为，这个建议中的条约的经济部分可能”对东南亚一些国家“有吸引力”。但是，美国宣传家丝毫也不能掩藏他们的狐狸尾巴，承认这个“经济计划”是要在东南亚侵略集团“提供的军事安全保证的保护下执行”，并且要把接受“美援”的国家逐步拖进侵略集团中去。
    因此，美国的这一切手段，只有使得东南亚侵略集团所包藏的祸心更加暴露出来，引起亚洲人民的更加警惕和普遍反对。现在印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰等国家都已表示它们不愿意参加这个侵略集团，并拒绝与之发生关系。印度总理尼赫鲁八月四日发表的演说中表示，亚洲国家不应该被迫在任何外国压力和外国影响下去做任何事情，“我希望亚洲国家在建设新亚洲的事务中相互合作。”印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约八月十日也声称：印尼将不参加东南亚公约组织并且不会派观察员出席讨论成立东南亚集团问题的会议。印尼国会外交小组委员会主席伦度诺乌并强调说：“我们将不参加反对所谓共产党侵略的斗争。印尼将坚定不移地奉行独立的政策。”
    这样一来，所谓“东南亚防御集团”就只有东南亚的泰国、菲律宾一些国家参加，而这些国家统治集团采取的立场是既不能代表东南亚人民，也完全违反其国内人民的意志和他们的民族利益的。连菲律宾参议院国防委员会主席雷克托也反对菲律宾参加东南亚集团。他说，在亚洲的国家只有菲律宾和泰国表示愿意参加东南亚集团，这样这两个国家在东南亚集团中就势必完全听命于非亚洲国家的决定。
    在东南亚和亚洲各国中，不是美国制造分裂和对立的军事集团，而是和平共处的五项原则，日益深入人心。印度支那的和平能够恢复，已经证明了这些原则可以适用于各国之间和一般国际关系之中，而且根据这些原则就能够促进协商解决一切问题，从而建立集体和平的区域，消除战争威胁。那些正在鼓吹的什么只有依靠美国的武力和所谓“美援”才能立足的陈腐论调，已经不值一文。人们很清楚，被绑在美国的战车上的国家，不论是它的和平安全，或是它的经济利益，都是根本谈不到的；相反地，只有集体和平的建立，各国平等互利的经济关系的发展，才能使亚洲各国享受到和平的利益。
    现在，美国仍然一意孤行地蛮干下去，竟于八月十四日宣布决定与它的盟国在九月六日在菲律滨的碧瑶举行成立东南亚侵略集团的会议。这就需要全世界人民和一切愿意和平共处的国家更加努力维护和平，使美国分裂亚洲、制造战争的政策遭到更大的失败。
