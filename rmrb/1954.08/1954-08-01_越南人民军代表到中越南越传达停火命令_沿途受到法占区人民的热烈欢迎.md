Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 30th—Vietnamese People's Army personnel conveying ceasefire orders and undertaking related work in Central and South Vietnam have been warmly welcomed by the people in French-occupied areas.

　　At 10:30 AM on the 27th, a convoy of Vietnamese People's Army personnel departed from Trung Gia to Gia Lam Airport near Hanoi, which was under French military control. They were preparing to fly to Central and South Vietnam to deliver ceasefire orders to the Vietnamese People's Army and guerrillas and to participate in the implementation of the armistice agreement terms in those regions. As their convoy traveled through the French-occupied area, the people along the way enthusiastically cheered them. When their convoy crossed the bridge over the Duong River, Bảo Đại soldiers and Black soldiers in the French army guarding the bridge and nearby strongholds also cheered and saluted them.

　　At noon that day, Lieutenant Deng Qi, who had completed the task of escorting the convoy, returned to Trung Gia from Gia Lam Airport. Lieutenant Deng Qi stopped at a tea stall along the way for a drink. When the local people selling tea saw the red-bottomed, yellow-starred insignia on his hat, they immediately shouted to those around, "Come quickly, people from Ho Chi Minh's army are back!" More than a dozen travelers resting in nearby tea shops immediately ran out and greeted Deng Qi warmly. They said: After eight years of separation, you have finally returned! They asked Deng Qi many questions and requested him to speak.

　　On his way back to Trung Gia, Black soldiers and French soldiers in many strongholds along the way applauded and cheered him again. This vividly reflected the French soldiers' desire for peace.

    越南人民军代表到中越南越传达停火命令
    沿途受到法占区人民的热烈欢迎
     【新华社北越三十日电】到中越、南越传达停火命令和工作的越南人民军工作人员，受到法占区人民的热烈欢迎。
    二十七日上午十时半，越南人民军工作人员的车队从中稼到河内附近的法军嘉林机场去，准备乘飞机到中越和南越向越南人民军和游击队传达停火命令，并参加这些地区实施停战协定条款的工作。他们的车队在法占区行进时，沿途人民都热烈地向他们欢呼。当他们的车队经过都翁河上的大桥时，守卫大桥和附近据点的保大士兵和法军中的黑人士兵也向他们欢呼和举手致敬。
    当日中午，完成了伴送车队任务的邓琦少尉从嘉林机场回中稼。邓琦少尉在途中的一个茶站上停下喝茶，卖茶的当地人民见他帽子上缀着红底黄星的帽徽，立即向四周高呼：“大家快来啊，胡公公军队的人回来啦！”在附近几家茶店里休息的十多个旅客立即跑出来，亲热地和邓琦打招呼，他们说：分别了八年，你们终于回来了！他们向邓琦问长问短，并请邓琦讲了话。
    邓琦在回中稼途中，沿途许多据点中的黑人士兵和法籍士兵又向他鼓掌和欢呼。这生动地反映了法军士兵渴望和平的情绪。
