U.S. Imperialism in Asia

    Another "Showcase"
    Since the Indochina armistice, reactionary American newspapers have been advocating that the United States should use "economic aid" as a tool for waging "cold war" in Asia.
    The "New York Post" of July 31st said: "Now that we (the United States) no longer have to pour billions of dollars into the French economy to support the actual war in Indochina, why can't we put a small part of these dollars into the struggle to win hearts and minds?" It is known that according to the Indochina armistice agreement, the Vietnamese people will hold free elections only after two years. Therefore, the "New York Post" suggested that the funds used for the Indochina war should be used in the next two years to build South Vietnam into a "democratic showcase" in Southeast Asia. The newspaper emphasized: "We have two years to build a democratic showcase in Asia that can be of some use. It is necessary for the West to prove to the Asian people that we still have something to show."
    Shortly after the Korean armistice, the United States also boasted that it would build South Korea into a "showcase" of the "free world." What exactly did the United States "show" in this "showcase"? That is what everyone is familiar with: about one million war orphans wandering the streets, more than two million unemployed struggling on the brink of starvation, and 11.16 million semi-unemployed and war victims...
    Another "democratic showcase"? The people of Indochina and the people of Asia will never welcome it, nor will they allow it!

    The Fate of "American Culture"
    In addition to advocating the use of "economic aid" as a tool for the United States to wage "cold war" in Asia, reactionary American newspapers also advocate the use of "cultural aid" to "win Asian hearts and minds."
    However, what is the fate of Hollywood movies and American comics, which represent "American culture," in Asia?
    On August 21st, in Penang, Malaya, twelve citizens (including four religious leaders) petitioned the local government to ban the public screening of an American film; they wrote in the petition: these "sexy movies" make a mockery of parents in their country cultivating politeness and a sense of justice in their children. According to a United Press report, in Ceylon, a member of parliament submitted a request to the government at the end of July to ban American comics, believing that American comics are harmful to children. Prior to this, in India, 13,000 housewives also called on the Indian government to stop the poison of American movies.
    Judging from the reaction of the people of Southeast Asian countries to "American culture," this "cold war" tool of the United States is not working!

    Two Gains and One Loss
    Recently, in countries receiving "U.S. aid," strange and bizarre incidents of "U.S. aid" disasters have emerged one after another. A report from Tokyo said: In late May, among the 45,000 bags of "U.S. aid" rice imported into Japan, 4,300 bags were found to be moldy rice containing toxins. According to Mr. Tanaka, the director of the National Institute of Health Experiment in Japan, if a person eats 3% of moldy rice containing toxins every day, their body and liver will undergo adverse changes after 35 days.
    The reason why this strange thing happens is that the so-called "aid" from the United States is actually to promote "surplus materials." Dodge, the former financial advisor to the U.S. occupying forces headquarters in Japan, once clearly stated: The materials "aiding" Japan "are all surplus materials" (50 to 80 percent of these surplus materials are of very poor quality grain), "precisely because of this, this type of material aid to Japan, whether now or in the future, does not mean increasing the (U.S.) government's expenditure."
    It does not "increase government expenditure" and can also sell off "surplus materials," which can truly be said to be a win-win situation! However, American "aid providers" should remember: besides the two gains there is also one loss: that is, losing people's hearts! Not long ago, the people of Yamagata Prefecture in Japan suffered severe diarrhea from eating American moldy rice, which aroused protests from people across Japan against American "aid."

    "Rumors Don't Live Long"
    There is a foreign saying: "Lies don't travel far, rumors don't live long!" This is very appropriate for the propaganda of the "Voice of America."
    According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on August 9th, Saxton Bradford, Assistant Director of the U.S. Information Agency, recently admitted that the "Voice of America" propaganda has been rejected by the people of the Far East countries. He said that the "Voice of America's" Far East programs have encountered unusual difficulties, and the biggest difficulty is the anti-colonial sentiment of the people of the Far East countries.
    Why do the people of the Far East reject the "Voice of America"? We only need to look at its background to know. According to the U.S. State Department's announcement in March 1951, the "Voice of America's" foreign programs are entirely determined by an "advisory committee" of eleven people, including representatives from the largest American companies and Wall Street banks. These representatives include: Reed, Chairman of General Electric; Shibaard, an employee of Rockefeller's "New Jersey Mobil Oil Company"; Burgess, Chairman of the Executive Committee of Morgan's "Citibank"; Farey, Chairman of Morgan and Rockefeller's "Coca-Cola Export Corporation"; Robbins, Vice President of Morgan and Rockefeller's "General Foods Corporation," and others.
    It would be strange if such a tool controlled by American capitalists, which constantly promotes American colonialism and spreads lies and rumors, was not rejected by the people of the Far East!

    Vicious Plot
    Western colonialists often use backward nations as targets for recruiting cannon fodder for aggression.
    The diplomatic observer of the Indian "People's Daily" reported in July that, according to the instructions of the U.S. Ambassador to Karachi, Hildreth, Pakistan should establish an army of 100,000 Pathans (the Pathan people live near the Afghan border) who are "ready to carry out American orders at any time." In addition, the Iranian "Furman Newspaper" reported that American military leaders, after "visiting" the border areas of Turkey, Iran, and Iraq where the Kurdish people live, have planned to form a well-equipped Kurdish force "so that it can be used when needed."
    The United States is once again directing its bloody calculations of recruiting cannon fodder to some backward Asian nations that many people do not know about. This shows how difficult it is to implement its plot of "using Asians to fight Asians," and it also shows how vicious this plot is!

    美帝国主义在亚洲
    再来一个“橱窗”
    印度支那停战后，美国反动报纸正在宣传，主张美国应该用“经济援助”作为在亚洲进行“冷战”的工具。
    七月三十一日的“纽约邮报”说：“既然我们
  （美国）已不必每年把几十亿美元投入法国的经济来支持印度支那的实际战争，为什么我们不能把这些美元中的很小一部分投入争取人心的斗争呢？”大家知道，按照印度支那停战协议，越南人民两年之后才举行自由选举。因此“纽约邮报”建议，在今后两年中应该把用在印度支那战争的款项，用来把越南南部建成东南亚的“民主橱窗”。这个报纸着重说：“我们还有两年的时间可以在亚洲建立一个能够有些用处的民主橱窗。西方有必要向亚洲人民证明我们还有一些可以显示的东西。”
    在朝鲜停战后不久，美国也曾大吹大擂说要把南朝鲜建成“自由世界”的“橱窗”。美国在这个“橱窗”里究竟“显示”了些什么东西呢？那就是大家很熟悉的：流浪街头的一百万左右战争孤儿、挣扎在饥饿线上的二百万以上的失业者和一千一百零十六万半失业者和战争受难者……
    再来一个“民主橱窗”？印度支那人民和亚洲人民决不欢迎，也决不允许！
      “美国文化”的遭遇
    除掉主张用“经济援助”作为美国在亚洲的“冷战”工具之外，美国反动报纸还主张用“文化援助”来“争取亚洲人心”。
    然而，代表“美国文化”的诲淫诲盗的好莱坞电影和美国连环图画，在亚洲的遭遇如何呢？
    八月二十一日，在马来亚的槟榔屿，有十二名市民（包括四名宗教界领袖）向当地政府请愿，要求禁止一部美国电影的公开放映；他们在请愿书上写道：这些“性感电影”使他们国家的父母在儿女中培养礼貌和正义感成了笑话。据合众社报道，在锡兰，一位议员在七月底向政府提出了禁止美国连环图画的要求，他认为美国连环图画对儿童是有害的。在这以前，在印度，一万三千名家庭妇女也曾呼吁印度政府制止美国电影的流毒。
    从东南亚各国人民对
  “美国文化”的反应上看来，美国的这种“冷战”工具是不灵了！
      两得和一失
    近来，在接受美国“援助”的国家里，遭受
  “美援”灾害的奇奇怪怪的事情层出不穷。来自东京的消息说：五月下旬，在输入日本的四万五千袋“美援”大米中，发现有四千三百袋是含有毒素的霉米。据日本国立卫生试验所试验部长田中说：一个人如果每天吃百分之三的含有毒素的霉米，三十五天以后身体和肝脏就会发生恶劣的变化。
    这种怪事所以会发生，是因为美国的所谓“援助”实际上就是推销“剩余物资”。前美国驻日本占领军总部财政顾问道奇就曾明白地说过：“援助”日本的物资“全是剩余物资”（这些剩余物资中有百分之五十到八十是质量极坏的粮食），“正因为如此，这类物资的对日援助，不论现在和将来，都不意味着增加（美国）政府的支出”。
    既不“增加政府的支出”，又可以推销掉“剩余物资”，这真可以说是一举两得！然而，美国“援助者”应该记住：两得之外还有一失：那就是失去了人心！不久前，就因为日本山形县人民吃了美国霉米大泻肚子而引起了日本各地人民对美国
  “援助”的抗议。
        “谣言活不长”
    外国有句俗话说：“谎话走不远，谣言活不长！”这对“美国之音”的宣传说来真是非常恰当的。
    据美联社华盛顿八月九日电讯报道，美国国际宣传署助理署长萨克斯顿·布雷德弗最近承认，
  “美国之音”宣传遭到远东各国人民的唾弃。他说，
  “美国之音”的远东节目碰到了不寻常的困难，而最大的一种困难，就是远东各国人民反对殖民主义的情绪。
    远东人民为什么唾弃“美国之音”呢？我们只要看一看它的背景就会知道了。据一九五一年三月美国国务院宣布，“美国之音”的国外节目，完全由一个包括美国最大的公司和华尔街的银行代表的十一人“咨询委员会”来决定的。这些代表中有：通用电气公司董事长里德、洛克菲勒的“新泽西美孚油公司”职员席巴德、摩根的“花旗银行”执行委员会主席柏格斯、摩根和洛克菲勒的“可口可乐出口公司”董事长法礼、摩根和洛克菲勒的“通用食品公司”副主席罗宾斯等人。
    这样一个为美国大资本家控制的、不断宣传美国殖民主义的撒谎造谣的工具，如果不被远东人民唾弃那才是怪事呢！
      恶毒的计谋
    西方殖民者常常把落后民族作为搜罗侵略炮灰的对象。
    印度“人民报”外交观察员在七月里报道，根据美国驻喀喇蚩大使希尔德莱斯的指示，巴基斯坦应当建立一支“随时准备执行美国命令”的十万人的巴丹人军队（巴丹族居住在接近阿富汗边境一带）。另外，伊朗“弗尔曼报”报道，美国军事领袖在“访问”了库狄族人居住的土耳其、伊朗和伊拉克边境地区之后，已计划成立一支装备精良的库狄人部队，“以便可以在需要时加以利用”。
    美国又把搜罗炮灰的血腥算盘打到很多人都不知道的一些亚洲落后民族身上来了。这说明它的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计谋实行起来是多么困难，也说明这一计谋是多么恶毒！
