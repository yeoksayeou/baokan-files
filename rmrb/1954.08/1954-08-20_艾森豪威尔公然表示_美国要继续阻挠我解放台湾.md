    Eisenhower Publicly States
    The United States Will Continue to Obstruct Our Liberation of Taiwan
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 18th: Washington dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower publicly stated at a press conference on the 17th that the U.S. government's instructions to the U.S. Seventh Fleet in early 1953 remain valid. As everyone knows, this instruction was a further hostile measure against the Chinese people taken after the Republican government came to power. It ordered the Seventh Fleet to use force to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and to encourage the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang to intensify its harassment of the Chinese mainland. At that time, this measure by the U.S. government aroused dissatisfaction and condemnation from broad public opinion in various countries around the world.
    In his remarks on the 17th, Eisenhower reiterated this illegal and aggressive stance and openly threatened that if the Chinese people want to liberate Taiwan, they must "first cross the barrier of the U.S. Seventh Fleet." In this way, Eisenhower once again exposed the ferocious face of the U.S. ruling clique as being hostile to the Chinese people.

    艾森豪威尔公然表示
    美国要继续阻挠我解放台湾
    【新华社十八日讯】华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔十七日在记者招待会上公然表示，美国政府在一九五三年年初给美国第七舰队的训令仍然有效。大家知道，这个训令是共和党政府上台以后所采取的进一步敌视中国人民的措施，它命令第七舰队以武力阻止中国人民解放台湾并鼓励蒋介石残余匪帮加紧对中国大陆的骚扰。当时，美国政府的这一措施曾引起世界各国广大舆论的不满和谴责。
    艾森豪威尔在十七日谈话中重申这种非法的侵略性的立场，并公然威胁说，如果中国人民要解放台湾，就必须“先越过美国第七舰队这道关”。这样，艾森豪威尔就再一次暴露了美国统治集团与中国人民为敌的凶恶面目。
