Broad masses of people enthusiastically discuss the Draft Constitution

    Editor's Note: At the People's Congress meetings in various provinces and cities, the people's representatives have enthusiastically discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and have respectively made resolutions endorsing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The following articles reflect the concern of many provincial people's representatives regarding the formulation of the fundamental law of the country and the serious and enthusiastic atmosphere during the discussion of the Draft Constitution.
    Everything for Socialism
    Liu Tong, Zhang Guang, Wang Ping
    The five hundred and thirty-five people's representatives attending the first session of the First People's Congress of Liaoning Province are, for the most part, people who have struggled out of suffering, been liberated from oppression, and are now dedicating themselves to a bright future. The blood and sweat and achievements of their past struggles are condensed in the Draft Constitution; the direction of their struggle today and in the future is clearly defined in the Draft Constitution. They have endless things to say about any article in the Draft Constitution.
    At the twenty-three group discussion meetings on August 13th and in the speeches at the plenary session on the 14th, they enthusiastically discussed the Draft Constitution, using their own personal experiences and vivid comparisons.
    This is at the group discussion meeting of the 15th group. Holding back a bellyful of words, everyone competed to speak. Gao Qinglian, a farmer representative from Yixian County, who couldn't get a chance to speak for a while, could only keep smoking. As the voice of Pu Fushen, a representative of agricultural science workers, fell, Gao Qinglian extinguished his cigarette and said, "Let me say a few words!" Everyone's eyes turned to him. A smile appeared on his bronze face as he said, "Today, discussing the Draft Constitution, I can't help but think of those 'laws' of the past. The Kuomintang also held 'elections' - to elect pseudo-National Assembly representatives. There was a big landlord in our Yixian County named Yue, who was the president of some high court of the Kuomintang. He spread leaflets among us, asking the people to elect him. The leaflet began by saying how many hectares of land he had, what high official he had been, and what foreign school he had graduated from...; look at our elections today: when a representative reports his resume, it's either he has carried out heavy labor for more than ten years, or suffered for many years, and done good things for the people. The cadres of our government go to the countryside, carrying their luggage themselves, paying for their meals, and only doing good things for the people. The Draft Constitution clearly stipulates that they must be loyal to the people's democratic system; in the past, we only heard about being loyal to the emperor, not loyal to the people. At that time, it was only the people who were called to be 'loyal' to them. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the puppet county magistrate of Yixian County went to our village to 'pacify' the people, encircling the farmers in the threshing ground. The puppet county magistrate and the landlords sat in the main room, saying that Manchukuo was 'copper walls and iron ramparts' and wanted everyone to 'protect' it. We drooped our heads and no one said a word. But look at today, we live and eat with the county magistrate. The person sleeping on the bed to my right is the county magistrate of Yixian County, in front is the county magistrate of Xingcheng County, and over there is the county magistrate of Jin County - we are all people's representatives, we are meeting together. We will also elect representatives to the National People's Congress, and they will represent the people to elect the Chairman of the State... You see how much power we have! The nature of the country has changed, the status of our people has also changed, and the energy towards the country has also changed! Look at our land, it's the same land, but in the past, one hectare of land couldn't yield eight shi of grain (approximately 4,000 catties), now it yields 10,000 catties! This is because we are putting our energy into it! I remember when Zhang Jinghui, the 'Prime Minister' of puppet Manchukuo, once passed through Yixian County, he issued an order for the police to force the people with guns to pull out all the sorghum that had tasseled on both sides of the railway, fearing that 'bandits' would emerge from the green gauze tents and attack his train - how many people went hungry and fled the famine that year! In that situation, it was good enough to save one's life."
    In the group discussion meeting of the 22nd group, most of the people sitting were workers from Siping City and Fuxin City. They were discussing the fundamental law of the country with the identity and feelings of masters of the country. Zhang Yihou, a tunneling worker from Xinqiu Coal Mine, had heard cries for help coming from coffins in the old society. That was when the Japanese devils nailed sick workers alive into six boards and carried them out to be buried. In the old society's factories and mines, workers were never treated as human beings, but in the new society's factories and mines, people are treated as the most valuable asset. Wherever there is a possibility of a little skin being broken, that place must be transformed to ensure safe production. All the rights of workers are stipulated in the fundamental law, as solid as a mountain. Zhang Yihou said: "We have nothing else to say, only to follow the provisions of the Draft Constitution, to give full play to our enthusiasm and creativity, and to strive to comprehensively and overfulfill the national plan." He reported good news to everyone: their tunneling team decided to complete the national task assigned to them for the second year of the Five-Year Plan eighty days ahead of schedule. He said: "Think about it: eighty days ahead of schedule in one year, the Five-Year Plan can be completed in four years; if everyone works hard like this, won't socialist society be realized sooner!"
    Sitting here is Li Chuanjiang. People who grow soybeans and eat soybean oil should know him. He spends months and years thinking of ways to extract the highest oil yield from soybeans. In the old society, he was a "oil pressing craftsman" looked down upon. When soybeans were on the market, the landlord would call him to press oil; after the oil was pressed, he would tell him to get lost, and he only had three or four months of work a year. He said: "If you ask me which article of the Draft Constitution impresses me the most, I can't finish saying it and I can't say it well - the entire Draft Constitution, every article is to my liking. Especially the importance of the worker-peasant alliance, after studying the Draft Constitution, it impresses me even more. The first article of the Draft Constitution mentions this point." This national model worker, who was illiterate in the old society and can now read newspapers in rudimentary way, paused here. He was thinking; because he didn't know where to start to express his feelings. After thinking for a while, his eyes flashed and he continued: "Let's start with soybeans. Our average oil yield in 1949 was about nine and a half catties (referring to the number of catties of oil produced from one hundred catties of soybeans), in 1950 it was eleven catties and two taels, in 1952 it was twelve catties, five taels and four qian, in 1953 it was thirteen catties and six qian, and in the first half of this year it was thirteen catties and five taels, with the highest reaching fourteen catties and six taels. This year we are determined to increase the average to fifteen catties. If the peasant brothers improve the quality of soybeans, for example, the current average oil content of soybeans is eighteen catties per hundred catties, if the oil content can be increased to twenty catties, then our oil yield can also be improved even more." The Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government is preparing to promote Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method nationwide this year. According to their statistics, if the national oil yield can be increased to twelve and a half catties (the current average is only eleven and a half to twelve catties), the increase in production in one year will be a very large number.
    The speakers all talked about their own experiences and determination from various perspectives. Science and technology workers expressed their willingness to contribute their talents, participate in technological innovation, and continuously improve and enhance technology, so that production can be carried out on a rapidly changing technological basis, and strengthen the state-owned economy; doctors are willing to face production and serve the workers and peasants; cultural and artistic workers are encouraged by the provisions of Article 95 of the Draft Constitution and are determined to use the creative method of socialist realism to arm themselves for creation and to conduct socialist education for the people. Representatives of private industry and commerce said that accepting the policy of utilization, restriction and transformation is their specific manifestation of supporting the Constitution. Zhang Yishan, a representative of the troops guarding the coastal defense line, said decisively: "In the past, I participated in the battle to defend Yan'an and persisted for seven days and seven nights. I was wounded and bled in that battle; now our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are in Beijing, leading us to build a socialist society, and beautiful ideals are being realized. We are willing to dedicate everything to it."

### 一切为着社会主义

专栏：广大人民热烈讨论宪法草案

    编者按：在各省市人民代表大会会议上，人民代表都热烈地讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案，并分别作出了拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案的决议。这里发表的几篇文章，就是反映许多省人民代表对于制定国家根本大法的关怀和讨论宪法草案时的严肃、热烈情况。
    一切为着社会主义
    刘彤　张光　王坪
    出席辽宁省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议的五百三十五位人民代表，绝大多数是从苦难里面斗争过来、从压迫下面解放出来、今天正为美好的未来而献身的人。他们过去斗争的血汗和成果，凝结在宪法草案之中；他们今天和今后斗争的方向，明确地规定在宪法草案里。对于宪法草案中的任何一条，他们都有说不尽的话。
    在八月十三日的二十三个小组讨论会上和在十四日的大会发言中，他们都兴奋地用自己的切身体会，用鲜明的对比，热烈地讨论了宪法草案。
    这是在第十五组的小组讨论会上。憋着一肚子话，大家争着发言，一时得不到机会发言的义县农民代表高清莲，只好不断地吸烟。农业科学工作者代表蒲富慎的语音一落，高清莲一面捏灭烟头，一面说：“让我说两句吧！”大家的眼睛转过来看着他。他紫铜色的脸上露出一丝微笑，说：“今天讨论宪法草案，不由得叫我想起从前那些‘王法’。国民党也搞‘选举’——选伪国大代表。我们义县有个姓岳的大地主，是国民党一个什么高等法院的院长，他向咱们撒传单，要老百姓选举他。传单一开头就说他有多少多少垧地，做过什么什么大官，在什么洋学堂毕业……；看看咱们今天的选举吧：代表一报告履历，不是扛过十几年大活，就是受过多少年苦，为人民办过那些好事。咱们政府的干部下乡，自己扛着行李，吃饭给饭钱，净给人民办好事。宪法草案上明白规定他们必须效忠人民民主制度；过去只听说效忠皇帝，没听说过效忠人民，那时只有叫人民‘效忠’他们。伪满时期，义县伪县长到我们村里‘宣抚’，把农民圈在场院里，伪县长和老财们坐在堂屋，说什么满洲国是‘铜帮铁底’，要大家‘保护’，咱们搭拉着脑瓜，谁也没吭声。可是你看看今天，我们和县长同起同卧，我右面的床上睡的是义县县长，前面是兴城县长，那面是锦县县长——咱们都是人民代表，咱们在一起开会。咱们还要选举全国人民代表大会的代表，他们还要代表人民选举国家的主席……你看看咱们权力有多大！国家的性质变了，咱们人民的地位也变了，对待国家的那股劲头也变了！你瞅瞅咱们的土地吧，同样是那些地，过去一垧地打不了八石粮（约合四千斤），现在要打一万斤！这就是咱们的劲使上了！我想起伪满‘国务总理’张景惠有次路过义县，下命令叫警察用枪逼着人民把铁路两边出了穗的高粱全部拔光，怕青纱帐里闯出‘胡子’来袭击他坐的火车——那年有多少老百姓挨饿逃荒啊！在那种情况下，保住活命就算好的了。”
    在第二十二组的小组讨论会场里，坐着的绝大部分是四平市和阜新市的工人。他们正以主人翁的身份和心情在讨论国家的根本大法。新邱煤矿掘进工人张义厚在旧社会里听见过从棺材里发出来的救命呼声，那是日本鬼子把害病的工人活活钉在六块板里硬抬出去埋葬。旧社会的厂矿里从不把工人当人对待，新社会的厂矿却把人当作最宝贵的财产，什么地方有可能碰破一点皮，什么地方就要加以改造，保证安全生产。工人的一切权利都订在根本大法上，像山一样不可动摇。张义厚说：“咱们没别的话说，只有按照宪法草案上的规定，发挥积极性和创造性，努力争取全面超额地完成国家计划。”他向大家报告一个好消息：他们掘进大队决定提前八十天完成五年计划第二年度国家给他们的任务。他说：“想想吧：一年提前八十天，五年计划就可以四年完成；大家都这样努力，社会主义社会还不就提早实现！”
    这边坐的是李川江。种大豆和吃豆油的人都应该知道他。他成年成月地想办法向大豆索取最高额的出油率。在旧社会他是被人瞧不起的“打油匠”。大豆上市了，地主把他叫去打油；油打完就叫他滚蛋，一年只有三、四个月的活可干。他说：“要问我宪法草案给我印象最深的是哪一条，我可说不完也说不好——整个一部宪法草案，条条都合我的心意。特别是工农联盟的重要性，学习宪法草案后给我的印象更深。宪法草案头一条就提到这一点。”这个在旧社会一字不识、今天已经初步能看报的全国劳动模范，说到这里就停顿了。他是在想；因为他不知道从那里说起才能表达他的感情。他想了想之后，眼睛里忽闪一亮，继续说：“还是从大豆说起吧。我们一九四九年的出油率平均是九斤半左右（指一百斤大豆制油的斤数），一九五○年是十一斤二两，一九五二年是十二斤五两四钱，一九五三年是十三斤零六钱，今年上半年是十三斤五两，最高有达十四斤六两的。我们今年决心平均提高到十五斤。要是农民弟兄们把大豆的质量提高，比方说，现在一般大豆的含油率平均是每百斤十八斤，要是能把含油率提高到二十斤的话，那么我们的出油率也可以提得更高。”中央人民政府轻工业部准备今年在全国推广李川江榨油法，据他们统计，全国的出油率如果能提高到十二斤半（现在平均只有十一斤半到十二斤），一年的增产量，就是一个很大的数字了。
    发言的人，都从各种角度谈到自己的体会和决心。科学技术工作者表示要把自己的才智贡献出来，参加技术革新，不断改进和提高技术，使生产在日新月异的技术基础上进行，壮大国营经济；医生们愿意面向生产，为工农群众服务；文化艺术工作者为宪法草案第九十五条的规定所鼓舞，决心用社会主义现实主义的创作方法武装起来进行创作，对人民进行社会主义教育。私营工商业代表表示，接受利用、限制和改造的政策，是他们拥护宪法的具体表现。镇守在海防线上的部队代表张义山斩钉截铁地说：“过去我参加过保卫延安的战斗，坚持了七天七夜，我在那次战斗中负了伤、流了血；现在我们的党中央和毛主席在北京，领导我们建设社会主义社会，美丽的理想正在实现，我们愿意为它献出一切。”
