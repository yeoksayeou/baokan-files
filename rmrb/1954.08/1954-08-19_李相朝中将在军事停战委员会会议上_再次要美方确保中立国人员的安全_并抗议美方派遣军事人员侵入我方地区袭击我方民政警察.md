Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th -- The Military Armistice Commission held its 47th meeting on August 17th.

    At the meeting, Senior Member of the Korean and Chinese side, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, pointed out: On August 9th and 10th, the US side once again held large-scale "demonstrations" in Gangneung, Gunsan, Seoul and other places in South Korea under its military control, openly threatening the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. This shows that the US side's serious violations of the Armistice Agreement, constantly threatening the safety and work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel since July 31st, are still continuing. This also proves that the responsibilities and guarantees undertaken by the US side at the Military Armistice Commission on August 3rd and 6th, as well as in the letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on August 4th, are still limited to empty talk, and no effective measures and practical actions have been taken to fulfill its responsibilities and realize its guarantees. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and our side have repeatedly requested the US side to severely punish the masterminds and murderers who fired shots and threw bombs at the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in Busan and Gunsan. However, the US side has not made any explanation to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to date, and these masterminds and murderers are still continuing these serious crimes today. The US side bears full responsibility for this. What is particularly serious is that following US Secretary of State Dulles' clamor to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, US Commander General Hull publicly slandered the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on August 8th, claiming that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be "dissolved". General Hull's statement violates Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement regarding both commanders providing full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and Article 17 of the Armistice Agreement regarding both commanders being responsible for complying with all the provisions of the Armistice Agreement. General Hull's statement is a more blatant expression of the US side's attempt to undermine the provisions of the Armistice Agreement relating to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and therefore has even more serious significance.

    Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao further pointed out: It is no coincidence that the US Commander went to Washington to participate in the talks between the United States and the Lee Seung-man government on accelerating the expansion of the South Korean army, navy and air force, and then immediately issued a statement in Tokyo that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be "dissolved". This fully shows that the US side is planning to undermine the existence of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which supervises the Korean armistice, in order to more freely transport reinforcements and war materials from outside Korea to step up the arming of Lee Seung-man, deepen the instability of the Korean armistice, and create tension in Asia.

    Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao finally pointed out: The provisions relating to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are an integral part of the Armistice Agreement and must not be arbitrarily undermined by the US side. The US side must immediately cease its hostile attitude towards the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and take effective measures and practical actions to fulfill all obligations stipulated in the Armistice Agreement and the responsibilities and guarantees already undertaken by the US side. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao also seriously warned the US side: The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel in the US military control area are still under the threat of life-threatening danger at any time, and the US side must immediately take all measures to ensure their safety. This is an inescapable responsibility of the US side.

    At the Military Armistice Commission on August 17th, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao also protested the US side's dispatch of military personnel at around 9:30 PM on August 10th to illegally cross the Military Demarcation Line, invade the vicinity of Mundung-ri in our demilitarized zone for an armed attack, and shoot and wound two of our civilian police officers. This incident of the US side violating the Armistice Agreement has been jointly investigated and verified by the Fifth Joint Observer Team on August 12th, and the US side must make a responsible explanation for this. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao also emphasized that the incident of the US side dispatching military personnel to invade our area for armed attacks has been constantly occurring since the armistice, and our side has protested many times. Recently, from August 3rd to 13th, in just eleven days, our side successively captured multiple groups of US military personnel who invaded our area to carry out hostile acts. These facts show that the US side, ignoring the provisions of the Armistice Agreement and our protests, is still continuing this violation of the Armistice Agreement, and the US side has the responsibility to immediately stop this illegal act, severely punish all relevant US personnel in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th -- During the meeting of the Fifth Joint Observer Team on the afternoon of the 14th, the US side members twice rejected the suggestion of the Korean and Chinese side members to submit a joint report to the Military Armistice Commission, attempting to use this to evade the US side's responsibility for violating the Armistice Agreement because US military personnel crossed the Military Demarcation Line on the evening of the 10th to launch an armed attack on civilian police from the Korean and Chinese side.

    During the meeting, the Korean and Chinese side members suggested submitting a joint report to the Military Armistice Commission based on the joint investigation conducted by both sides on the 12th. During the joint investigation, witnesses testified that three military personnel came from the US side area south of the Military Demarcation Line and fled back to the US side area after the attack. The evidence found at the scene after the fact included a submachine gun used by the attackers, twenty-two bullet casings and two bullets, and a flour sack stained with blood.

    The Korean and Chinese side members suggested making the following judgment on this violation of the Armistice Agreement by the US side: "Based on the witness testimony and the physical evidence at the scene, it is indeed proven that three military personnel from the United Nations Command side illegally entered the demilitarized zone with submachine guns at approximately 9:30 PM on August 10, 1954, and crossed the Military Demarcation Line to enter the vicinity of Mundung-ri in the demilitarized zone under the jurisdiction of the Korean and Chinese side, and launched an attack on the civilian police of the Korean and Chinese side, wounding civilian police officers Bae Jik-gi and Lee Bong-gi, which seriously violated the Armistice Agreement."

    Ignoring the facts determined by the witness testimony and the physical evidence, the US side members twice refused to agree to the joint report suggested by the Korean and Chinese side members. He even demanded that the Korean and Chinese side members agree to the report fabricated by the US side, saying that there was no evidence to prove this incident. However, when the Korean and Chinese side members refuted him with the physical evidence and witness testimony from the on-site investigation, he unreasonably insisted that the members of both sides submit separate reports to the Military Armistice Commission.

    The Korean and Chinese side members finally pointed out: The US side cannot deny that the three military personnel who attacked and wounded the civilian police of the Korean and Chinese side came from the US side area and finally fled back to the US side area. The US side also cannot deny the various physical evidence abandoned by the US military personnel during their escape. This conclusive fact proves that this violation of the Armistice Agreement was intentionally created by the US side. The Korean and Chinese side members will submit the above judgment to the Military Armistice Commission in their own report.

    李相朝中将在军事停战委员会会议上
    再次要美方确保中立国人员的安全
    并抗议美方派遣军事人员侵入我方地区袭击我方民政警察
    【新华社开城十七日电】军事停战委员会在八月十七日举行第四十七次会议。
    会上朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将指出：八月九日和十日，美方又在其军事控制下的南朝鲜江陵、群山、汉城等地，举行公开威胁中立国监察委员会的大规模“示威游行”。这说明美方自七月三十一日以来，不断威胁中立国监察委员会人员的安全与工作的严重违反停战协定的行为仍在继续。这也证明了美方在八月三日和六日的军事停战委员会上，以及八月四日致中立国监察委员会的信中，所承担的责任与保证，仍然只是限于空谈，并未采取有效措施和实际行动来履行责任，实现保证中立国监察委员会及我方曾一再要求美方严惩在釜山、群山向中立国视察小组开枪射击与投掷炸弹的主谋与凶手。但美方迄今仍未向军事停战委员会及中立国监察委员会作过任何交代，而这些主谋与凶手今天还在继续这种严重的罪恶行为。对此，美方负有完全的责任。尤其严重的是：继美国国务卿杜勒斯叫嚣要取消中立国监察委员会之后，美方总司令赫尔将军在八月八日竟也公然对中立国监察委员会进行肆意的诬蔑，声称中立国监察委员会应予“解散”。赫尔将军的这一声明，违反了停战协定第十三款关于双方司令官应给予中立国监察委员会以充分保护及一切可能的协助与合作的规定，以及停战协定第十七款关于双方司令官有责任遵守停战协定的全部条款的规定。赫尔将军的这一声明，是美方企图破坏停战协定有关中立国监察委员会的条款的更加明目张胆的表示，因此就具有更严重的意义。
    李相朝中将进一步指出：美方总司令在前往华盛顿参加了美国与李承晚政府关于加速扩充南朝鲜陆、海、空军的会谈，而回到东京以后马上发表所谓中立国监察委员会应予“解散”的声明，这决不是偶然的。它充分说明美方正有计划地要破坏监督朝鲜停战的中立国监察委员会的存在，以便更放手地从朝鲜境外运入增援的作战物资，来加紧武装李承晚，以加深朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，制造亚洲的紧张局势。
    李相朝中将最后指出：有关中立国监察委员会的各条款，是停战协定中不可分割的组成部分，绝不容许美方任意破坏。美方必须立即停止对中立国监察委员会的敌对态度，采取有效措施和实际行动，以履行停战协定所规定的全部义务和美方所已经承担的责任和保证。李相朝中将并严重警告美方：现在美方军事控制地区内的中立国监察委员会人员仍然处在随时会遭受生命危险的威胁之中，美方必须立即采取一切措施确保他们的安全，这是美方无可逃避的责任。
    在八月十七日的军事停战委员会上，李相朝中将并抗议美方派遣军事人员于八月十日下午九时三十分左右，非法越过军事分界线，侵入我方非军事区文登里附近进行武装袭击，开枪打伤我方民政警察两名。美方这一违反停战协定的事件已经第五联合观察小组在八月十二日进行了共同调查加以证实，美方必须对此作出负责的交代。李相朝中将并着重指出：美方派遣军事人员侵入我方地区进行武装袭击的事件，自停战以来不断发生，我方曾经多次抗议。最近自八月三日至十三日仅仅十一天内，我方即先后捕获侵入我方地区进行敌对行为的美方军事人员多批。这些事实说明，美方无视停战协定的规定与我方的抗议，仍在继续这种违反停战协定的行为，美方有责任立即停止这种非法行为。按照停战协定的规定，严惩所有有关的美方人员，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    【新华社开城十六日电】在第五联合观察小组十四日下午会晤的时候，美方组员两次拒绝了朝中方面组员的向军事停战委员会提出共同报告的建议，企图借此逃避美方军事人员十日晚间越过军事分界线武装袭击朝中方面民政警察因而违反了停战协定的责任。
    朝中方面组员在会晤时建议根据双方在十二日进行的共同调查，向军事停战委员会提出共同报告。在共同调查中，证人证明三名军事人员来自军事分界线以南美方地区，在进行袭击后又逃回了美方地区。事后搜查现场发现的证物有袭击者使用的冲锋枪一支，子弹壳二十二个和子弹二发，以及染有血迹的面袋一只。
    朝中方面组员建议对美方的这次违反停战协定事件作出如下的判语：“根据证人证词及现场物证，确实证明联合国军方面军事人员三名于一九五四年八月十日二十一时三十分左右，携带冲锋枪非法进入非军事区，并越过军事分界线进入朝中方面管辖下的非军事区文登里附近，向朝中方面民政警察进行袭击，打伤朝中方面民政警察裴直基、李凤基两人，严重违反了停战协定。”
    美方组员不顾证人证词及证物所确定的事实，两次拒绝同意朝中方面组员所建议的共同报告。他甚至要求朝中方面组员同意美方捏造的报告，说是没有证据证明这次事件。但当朝中方面组员举出现场调查的物证及证人证词加以驳斥后，他又毫无道理地坚持双方组员分别向军事停战委员会提出单独报告。
    朝中方面组员最后指出：美方无法否认三名袭击和打伤朝中方面民政警察的军事人员是来自美方地区、最后又逃回了美方地区的。美方也无法否认美方军事人员逃窜中遗弃下的各项物证。这一确凿的事实证明这次违反停战协定事件是美方有意制造的。朝中方面组员将自行在报告中将上述判语提交军事停战委员会。
