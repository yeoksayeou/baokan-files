    Talk by Zhao Puchu, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China
    All Buddhists in China wholeheartedly support the diplomatic report made by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. The unremitting efforts made by the Chinese delegation, headed by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, at the Geneva Conference for the cause of peace, and the outstanding contributions made in reaching an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, fully embody the noble spirit of China's peaceful diplomatic policy and the great power of this policy. Furthermore, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence proposed by Premier Zhou in his talks with the Prime Ministers of India and Burma—mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence—express the lofty will of the entire Chinese people. If these principles can be applied on a larger scale, peace will be reliably guaranteed and the policy of war will be thoroughly defeated.
    Taiwan has been our sacred territory since ancient times. Liberating Taiwan is the sacred and inviolable task of the Chinese people. The American aggressive bloc, which suffered a serious defeat at the Geneva Conference, is unwilling to accept its defeat and continues to play with fire, continuing to be enemies with the 600 million Chinese people and the people of the world. It is not only continuing to conspire to piece together its aggressive blocs in Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia, but it is also arrogantly supporting the remnants of the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which has long become a zombie, in a vain attempt to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. The American aggressive bloc's calculation is wrong again. Liberating Taiwan is our internal affair, and no one has the right to interfere, nor will we allow anyone to interfere. Buddhists across China: We must strengthen our study of patriotism, raise our level of awareness, abide by government laws and decrees, respond to government calls, and unite with the people of the whole country to strive tirelessly for the liberation of Taiwan and the defense of Asian and world peace. Whoever dares to obstruct us will surely reap the bitter fruit of their actions.

    Talk by Da Pongsheng, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association
    The diplomatic report made by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee clearly and explicitly explained our country's current diplomatic policies and tasks, and gave a detailed account of the course and results of the Geneva Conference. This diplomatic report represents the common ideas and wishes of the people of all nationalities in the country.
    The significant achievements made at the Geneva Conference have further eased international tensions. This is a great victory for peace-loving people all over the world. The tremendous contributions made by Premier Zhou Enlai on behalf of our country at the Geneva Conference demonstrate the important position and strength of the Chinese people in resolving international affairs. The report emphasizes that our country's foreign policy is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence—mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence—and calls on the people of the whole country to fight for the liberation of Taiwan. On behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in China who believe in Islam, I express my firm support and heartfelt endorsement.
    Taiwan is a sacred part of the People's Republic of China, but it is still occupied by the traitorous Chiang bandit gang and American imperialism, and they are constantly harassing our mainland, threatening and hindering our construction and security. This is not only an infringement on our country's territorial sovereignty and interference in our internal affairs, but also a threat to peace in the Far East and the world, creating a tense international situation. This is intolerable to the great Chinese people and peace-loving people of all countries. Liberating Taiwan is the just action of the Chinese people to defend their territorial sovereignty and also a necessary measure to defend peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. If American aggressors dare to interfere in our internal affairs, they will reap the bitter fruit of their actions.
    We, the people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam, have unlimited confidence in the glorious historical task of liberating Taiwan. Therefore, we must unite more closely and fight to the end with the people of the whole country to accomplish this glorious historical task.

    拥护周总理兼外长的外交报告
    中国佛教协会副会长赵朴初的谈话
    全中国佛教徒衷心拥护周恩来总理兼外长在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上所作的外交报告。以周总理兼外长为首的中国代表团在日内瓦会议上为了和平事业所作的不懈努力以及在达成恢复印度支那和平问题的协议上作出的卓越贡献，完全体现了中国和平外交政策的高尚精神以及这一政策的巨大威力。而周总理在和印度、缅甸总理会谈中所提出的和平共处的五项原则——互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处，更表达了全中国人民的崇高意志。如果这些原则能在更大的范围内加以施用，则和平必将得到可靠保证而战争政策必将遭到彻底失败。
    台湾从古以来就是我国的神圣领土。解放台湾，是中国人民神圣不可侵犯的任务。在日内瓦会议上遭受到严重失败的美国侵略集团，不甘心于它的失败，它还要继续地玩火，继续与六万万中国人民和全世界人民为敌。它不仅在继续阴谋拼凑它的东南亚、东北亚的侵略集团，而且更在狂妄地支持早已成了僵尸的卖国贼蒋介石残余匪帮，妄图以此来阻挠中国人民对于台湾的解放。美国侵略集团的算盘又打错了。解放台湾，是我国内部的事情，任何人都无权来干涉，我们也决不容许任何人来干涉。全中国的佛教徒们：我们要加强爱国主义学习，提高觉悟程度，服从政府法令，响应政府号召，要和全国人民团结一致，为解放台湾、保卫亚洲与世界和平而奋斗不息。有谁胆敢来阻挠我们，它必将自食其恶果。　（新华社）
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生的谈话
    周恩来总理兼外交部部长在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上所作的外交报告，清楚而明确的说明了我国当前的外交政策和任务，并详尽的叙述了日内瓦会议的经过及结果，这个外交报告代表着全国各民族人民共同的意念和愿望。
    日内瓦会议中所取得的重大成就，促使国际紧张局势得到进一步的缓和，这是全世界爱好和平的人民的伟大胜利。周恩来总理代表我国在日内瓦会议中所作出的巨大贡献，说明了中国人民在解决国际事务中的重要地位和力量。报告中着重指出我国的外交政策是根据互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处的五项原则，并号召全国人民为解放台湾而斗争。我代表中国信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民表示坚决的支持和衷心的拥护。
    台湾是中华人民共和国神圣的领土的一部分，但至今仍为卖国贼蒋匪集团与美帝国主义所盘据，并且不断向我国大陆侵扰，威胁与阻碍我国的建设与安全。这不仅是侵犯我国领土主权，干涉我国内政，同时更威胁着远东与世界的和平，造成紧张的国际局势，这是伟大的中国人民与爱好和平的世界各国人民所不能容忍的。解放台湾是中国人民保卫自己领土主权的正当行动，也是保卫远东与世界和平的必要措施。中国人民一定要解放台湾，美国侵略者如敢于干涉我国的内政，将自食恶果。
    我们信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民对于解放台湾这项光荣的历史任务抱着无限的信心，因此我们要更紧密地团结起来，与全国人民为完成这项光荣的历史任务奋斗到底。（新华社）
