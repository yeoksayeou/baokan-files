    Pay Attention to Promoting the "Locomotive" Role of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
    Xue Feng
    The broad masses of peasants call agricultural producers' cooperatives the "locomotives" of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. This saying vividly expresses the Party's current policy of running agricultural producers' cooperatives well in order to drive the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement forward. However, if agricultural producers' cooperatives are to truly play the role of "locomotive," they must not only do a good job in production and management, using facts to prove that cooperatives are superior to individual farming and mutual aid teams in order to gain the trust of the peasants; they must also be good at uniting and helping mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and leading them forward together. Therefore, in the propaganda of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, newspapers should not only fully reflect the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives, but also pay attention to publicizing how agricultural producers' cooperatives are driving mutual aid teams and individual farmers to advance together.
    In the past six months, the Xi'an Masses Daily and the Shanxi Daily have paid more attention to this aspect of propaganda. These two newspapers first paid attention to reporting how agricultural producers' cooperatives, with a socialist spirit, provide mutual aid teams and individual farmers with friendly assistance in various aspects, from political and ideological education, mutual aid and cooperation experience, production technology, and even manpower and animal power. The Xi'an Masses Daily paid particular attention to this aspect of reporting. In a report on February 19th, it introduced the situation of the Suide Baodezhou Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, which regularly helps mutual aid teams in the village solve internal problems, and helps the surrounding mutual aid teams and individual farmers overcome production difficulties in terms of manpower and animal power. In a report on April 16th, it further reflected that the Yan'an Liulin Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative actively helped the mutual aid teams in the same village solve ideological problems, learn the method of work point calculation, and formulate production increase plans during the spring plowing, so that the mutual aid teams were consolidated and improved; it helped individual farmers solve difficulties in many aspects such as plowing livestock and farm tools; and in order to promote afforestation, it helped all the farmers in the village to transport tree seedlings from seven or eight miles away. This sincere concern and help from agricultural producers' cooperatives to mutual aid teams and individual farmers not only promoted current production, but also strengthened the unity within the peasantry, expanded the influence of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The newspapers did not neglect this important fact in their reports. For example, many people around the Liulin Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative called the cooperative a "locomotive," and automatically learned from the cooperative. Some farmers who did not harrow the land after plowing in the past, seeing that the cooperative plowed and harrowed at the same time, also took time to harrow the land; the masses who originally did not plan to plant trees before the Qingming Festival, seeing that the agricultural producers' cooperative was planting trees, also went to plant trees. The result of the Baodezhou Agricultural Producers' Cooperative's frequent assistance to the masses outside the cooperative, coupled with the good influence of the increased income of the cooperative members, improved the understanding of the masses outside the cooperative about the cooperative, making more than a dozen farmers successively request to join the cooperative. Through these reports, the newspapers on the one hand educated agricultural producers' cooperatives that they should carry out the principle of advanced helping the backward with a socialist spirit; on the other hand, they revealed to the broad masses of peasants how agricultural producers' cooperatives, this advanced production organization, care about the interests of all peasants, handle various relationships inside and outside the cooperative reasonably and legally, thereby attracting them to lean towards socialism.
    Organizing mass labor competitions is an important method for the advanced to lead the backward. Both the Xi'an Masses Daily and the Shanxi Daily have paid attention to reporting and promoting the experience of carrying out competitions between agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams, thereby driving the mutual aid teams and individual farmers. For example, the Shanxi Daily once introduced the experience of Xiatuanbai Village in Fenxi. This experience shows that last year, through small-scale production competitions between agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and between mutual aid teams, Xiatuanbai Village not only overcame various natural disasters and ensured a good harvest for the whole village; at the same time, because the agricultural producers' cooperative helped the mutual aid teams and individual farmers in various aspects during the competition, it strengthened the relationship between the cooperative and the teams and individual farmers, and promoted the consolidation and improvement of most of the mutual aid teams. In previous years, most of the mutual aid teams found it difficult to maintain consolidation throughout the year, and disputes and disbandment often occurred during the summer harvest or autumn harvest. Last year, with the specific help of the agricultural producers' cooperative, most of the sixteen mutual aid teams achieved year-round mutual assistance. The Xi'an Masses Daily also reported that the Lishengkai Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Wuxiang, Ba District, Suide, invited the members of eleven mutual aid teams in the township to summarize the experience of carrying out the patriotic production increase competition during the spring plowing last year, affirmed the role of carrying out the competition in promoting production, improving farming, and achieving production increase, and decided to continue to launch the competition this year. The newspaper pointed out in a short commentary that this is a good way for agricultural producers' cooperatives to drive mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and suggested that local leading organs pay attention to this practice and guide and promote it. The newspaper not only pays attention to reflecting how agricultural producers' cooperatives unite and help the masses outside the cooperative with a socialist spirit, but also pays attention to excavating and disseminating concrete and effective ways for agricultural producers' cooperatives to drive the masses outside the cooperative, which can promote agricultural producers' cooperatives to carry out this comrade-like assistance in a more planned way.
    The Xi'an Masses Daily and the Shanxi Daily also paid attention to publicizing the experience of mutual aid and cooperation networks, and elaborated on the role and significance of mutual aid and cooperation networks in linking agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams and promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The Xi'an Masses Daily once introduced in a relatively systematic way the experience of the mutual aid and cooperation network in Chang'an County with the Puzhongzhi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Wangmang Village as the core. This mutual aid and cooperation network was established in the spring of last year. By the end of last year, the mutual aid and cooperation network included nineteen mutual aid teams in ten surrounding villages. Around these mutual aid teams, there were also eight or ninety mutual aid teams united, forming a large network covering small networks and small networks connecting large networks, playing the role of driving at all levels and combining points and surfaces. Since the establishment of the mutual aid and cooperation network a year ago, it has held more than ten meetings to exchange experiences, spreading the advanced production experience and mutual aid and cooperation experience of Wangmang Village, which has been of great help to the surrounding villages in increasing rice production and consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The Shanxi Daily not only reported the achievements and experiences of establishing mutual aid and cooperation networks in various places, but also published an editorial elaborating in detail the role of mutual aid and cooperation networks. The newspaper pointed out on the one hand that this is a good leadership method, and adopting this method can solve the contradiction between the large-scale development of agricultural producers' cooperatives and the insufficient number of cooperative cadres and insufficient experience, as well as the contradiction between running agricultural producers' cooperatives well and leading the broad masses of mutual aid teams. On the other hand, it pointed out that the mutual aid and cooperation network itself is a kind of socialist political, economic, and technical connection between agricultural producers' cooperatives, especially between agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams and the broad masses of peasants outside the cooperative. Through this connection, mutual support and mutual learning between mutual aid and cooperation organizations can be strengthened, especially the systematic assistance of agricultural producers' cooperatives to mutual aid teams, thereby strengthening the relationship between agricultural producers' cooperatives and the masses outside the cooperative, and promoting the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The newspaper fully explained the role and significance of mutual aid and cooperation networks from the perspective of both theory and fact, which not only helps local leading organs to better grasp this leadership method, but also helps agricultural producers' cooperative members to improve their understanding and consciously and actively participate in the activities of the mutual aid and cooperation network.
    In the past six months, newspapers in various places have generally paid more attention to publicizing the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives and publicizing the experience of running cooperatives, which is very necessary and needs to be further strengthened. Because only by running agricultural producers' cooperatives well and truly being able to increase production and increase the actual income of cooperative members can we truly attract the broad masses of peasants to take the socialist road with concrete and practical examples. However, our newspapers cannot ignore the need to publicize that agricultural producers' cooperatives should carry forward the socialist spirit, implement the principle of advanced leading the backward, and unite and help mutual aid teams and individual farmers from many aspects, leading everyone to advance together, improve agricultural production, and consolidate and expand mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Now autumn has come, and various places will continue to vigorously develop agricultural producers' cooperatives. Therefore, some of the experiences of the Xi'an Masses Daily and the Shanxi Daily in this regard are still worth referring to.

### 注意宣传农业生产合作社的“火车头”作用

    注意宣传农业生产合作社的“火车头”作用
    薛峰
    广大农民称农业生产合作社为互助合作运动的“火车头”。这个说法生动地表达了党在目前办好农业生产合作社以带动整个互助合作运动前进的方针。但是农业生产合作社要真正发挥“火车头”的作用，就不仅要搞好生产、搞好经营，用事实来证明合作社比单干和互助组优越，以便取得农民的信任；而且要善于团结和帮助互助组和单干农民，带动他们一同前进。因此报纸在农业互助合作的宣传中，除了应当充分反映农业生产合作社的优越性外，还应当注意宣传农业生产合作社怎样带动互助组和单干农民一同前进。
    近半年来，西安群众日报和山西日报是比较重视这方面的宣传的。这两个报纸首先注意报道了农业生产合作社怎样以社会主义精神，从政治思想教育、互助合作经验、生产技术乃至人力、畜力等各方面，给予互助组和单干农民以友谊的帮助。西安群众日报特别注意这方面的报道。在二月十九日的一篇报道中，就介绍了绥德鲍德周农业生产合作社经常帮助村上互助组解决组内问题，并从人力和畜力上帮助周围的互助组和单干农民克服生产困难的情况。在四月十六日的一篇报道中，更反映了延安柳林村农业生产合作社在春耕中积极帮助同村的互助组解决思想问题，学会评工计分办法，制订增产计划，使互助组得到巩固和提高；帮助单干农民解决耕畜、农具等多方面的困难；并为了推动大家植树造林，帮助全村农民从七、八里路外背运树苗。农业生产合作社对于互助组和单干农民的这种热诚的关心和帮助，不仅推动了当前的生产，而且加强了农民内部的团结，扩大了农业生产合作社的影响，推动了互助合作运动。报纸在报道中没有忽视这个重要的事实。如柳林村农业生产合作社周围的许多群众都称该社为“火车头”，自动地向合作社学习，一些过去翻了地不耱的农民，见社里随翻随耱，他们也抽出时间进行耱地；原来不计划在清明节前植树造林的群众，见农业生产合作社植树造林，他们也去栽树。鲍德周农业生产合作社经常对社外群众进行帮助的结果，加上该社社员收入增加的良好影响，提高了社外群众对合作社的认识，使得十多户农民陆续要求入社。报纸通过这些报道，一方面教育了农业生产合作社应该以社会主义精神，贯彻先进帮助落后的原则；另一方面向广大农民揭示了农业生产合作社这个先进的生产组织，怎样关心全体农民的利益，合情合理地处理社内外的各种关系，从而吸引他们倾向社会主义。
    组织群众性的劳动竞赛，是先进带动落后的重要方法。西安群众日报和山西日报都曾注意报道和推广农业生产合作社和互助组之间开展竞赛，从而带动互助组并带动单干农民的经验。例如，山西日报曾介绍了汾西下团柏村的经验。这个经验说明，下团柏村去年通过农业生产合作社与互助组、互助组与互助组之间的小型生产竞赛，不仅战胜了种种自然灾害，保证了全村的丰收；同时由于在竞赛中农业生产合作社从各方面对互助组和单干农民进行帮助，密切了社和组及单干农民的关系，并促进了大部分互助组的巩固和提高。像往年绝大部分互助组很难做到常年巩固，每逢夏收或秋收时，常常发生纠葛和散伙现象。去年在农业生产合作社的具体帮助下，十六个互助组大都做到了常年互助。西安群众日报也曾报道了绥德八区五乡李生开农业生产合作社邀请该乡十一个互助组组员们总结去年春耕时开展爱国增产竞赛的经验，肯定了开展竞赛对于推动生产、改进作务、实现增产的作用，并决定今年继续发动竞赛。该报在短评中指出，这是农业生产合作社带动互助组和单干农民的一种好办法，建议各地领导机关重视这种做法，并加以指导和推广。报纸不仅注意反映农业生产合作社如何以社会主义精神来团结和帮助社外群众，而且注意发掘和传播农业生产合作社带动社外群众的具体有效的方式，这就能推动农业生产合作社更加有计划地进行这种同志式的帮助。
    西安群众日报和山西日报还注意宣传了互助合作网的经验，阐明了互助合作网在联系农业生产合作社和互助组、推动互助合作运动方面的作用和意义。西安群众日报曾经比较系统地介绍了长安县以王莽村蒲忠智农业生产合作社为核心的互助合作网的经验。这个互助合作网成立于去年春天，到去年年底为止，参加互助合作网的包括周围十个村的十九个互助组，在这些互助组的周围又团结着八、九十个互助组，形成大网套小网、小网连大网，发挥了层层带动、点面结合的作用。互助合作网成立一年以来，召开了十多次交流经验的会议，传播了王莽村的先进生产经验和互助合作经验，对周围村庄提高水稻产量、巩固和发展互助合作组织有很大的帮助。山西日报不仅报道了各地建立互助合作网的成绩和经验，而且发表社论详细阐明了互助合作网的作用。报纸一方面指出，这是一种好的领导方法，采用这种方法就能够解决农业生产合作社大量发展和办社干部数量不足、经验不够的矛盾，以及办好农业生产合作社和领导广大互助组的矛盾。另一方面指出，互助合作网本身就是农业生产合作社之间、特别是农业生产合作社与互助组以及社外广大农民群众之间的一种社会主义的政治上、经济上、技术上的联系，通过这种联系就可以加强互助合作组织之间的相互支援相互学习，特别是农业生产合作社对互助组的系统帮助，从而密切农业生产合作社与社外群众之间的关系，促进互助合作运动的发展。报纸从道理上和事实上充分说明互助合作网的作用和意义，不仅有助于各地领导机关更好地掌握这个领导方法，而且有助于农业生产合作社社员提高认识，自觉地积极地参加互助合作网的活动。
    近半年来，各地报纸一般都比较重视宣传农业生产合作社的优越性，宣传办社的经验，这是十分必要而且需要继续加强的。因为只有把农业生产合作社办好，确实能够增加生产、增加社员的实际收入，才能真正以具体的实际的榜样来吸引广大农民走社会主义的道路。但是我们的报纸也不能忽视宣传农业生产合作社应该发扬社会主义精神，贯彻先进带动落后的原则，从多方面来团结、帮助互助组和单干农民，带动大家一同前进，提高农业生产，巩固和扩大互助合作组织。现在秋季已经来临，各地将要继续大力发展农业生产合作社。因此西安群众日报和山西日报在这一方面的某些经验，还是值得参考的。
