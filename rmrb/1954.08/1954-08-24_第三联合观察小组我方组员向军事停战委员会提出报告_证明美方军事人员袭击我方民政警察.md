Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 22nd: The Third Joint Observer Team met at Songhyon at 2:00 PM on the 20th. The Korean-Chinese side's members cited the fact, which had been confirmed by investigation, that U.S. military personnel attacked the Korean-Chinese side's civilian police on the morning of the 17th, and suggested that both sides' members submit a joint report to the Military Armistice Commission. However, the U.S. side's members flatly denied this and refused to submit a joint report.

The Korean-Chinese side's members pointed out at the meeting that the testimony of witness Li Zhenshan and others confirmed that three military personnel who attacked our civilian police moved from south to north after crossing the military demarcation line and opened fire on our civilian police. After our civilian police returned fire, one of them was killed, and the other two fled back to the U.S. side's area south of the military demarcation line. The deceased was wearing a South Korean army uniform and carried a notebook, photos, and a package of American-made dry food. The above facts prove that the U.S. side dispatched military personnel across the military demarcation line on the morning of the 17th to attack the Korean-Chinese side's civilian police.

The U.S. side's members admitted that the witnesses' testimonies were consistent. He also could not deny the evidence that both sides' members had examined during the joint investigation. However, regardless of the facts, he attempted to deny that these three military personnel belonged to the U.S. side, and insisted that there was no evidence to prove that U.S. military personnel crossed the military demarcation line to launch an armed attack on the Korean-Chinese side's personnel.

The Korean-Chinese side's members reiterated the facts to refute this and pointed out that the U.S. side's members, regardless of the facts, refused to submit a joint report, which cannot allow the U.S. side to escape the responsibility for violating the armistice agreement.

The Korean-Chinese side's members pointed out in the conclusion of the report submitted independently to the Military Armistice Commission: "Based on the on-site investigation, witness testimonies, and items found on the deceased, it is clearly proven that at approximately 3:30 AM on August 17, 1954, three armed military personnel from the United Nations Command side illegally crossed the military demarcation line and entered the demilitarized zone under the jurisdiction of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers side, attacking the civilian police of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers."

    第三联合观察小组我方组员向军事停战委员会提出报告
    证明美方军事人员袭击我方民政警察
    【新华社开城二十二日电】　第三联合观察小组于二十日下午二时在松岘会晤。朝中方面组员举出已经调查确定的十七日晨美方军事人员袭击朝中方面民政警察的事实，建议双方组员向军事停战委员会提出共同报告，但美方组员矢口抵赖，拒绝提出共同报告。
    朝中方面组员在会晤时指出，证人李振山等的证词确定，三名袭击我方民政警察的军事人员越过军事分界线后从南向北移动，并开枪射击我方民政警察。在我方民政警察还击后，其中一人被击毙，另外二人逃回军事分界线以南美方地区。死者身着南朝鲜军服装，并携有笔记本、照片和美国制的干粮一包。以上的事实证明美方在十七日晨派遣军事人员越过军事分界线袭击朝中方面民政警察。
    美方组员承认证人证词是一致的。他也无法否认双方组员曾在共同调查中察看过的证物。然而，他不顾事实企图否认这三名军事人员是属于美方的，并硬说没有证据证明美方军事人员越过军事分界线武装袭击朝中方面人员。
    朝中方面组员再度举出事实予以驳斥并指出，美方组员不顾事实，拒绝提出共同报告，决不能使美方逃脱违反停战协定的责任。
    朝中方面组员在自行提交军事停战委员会的报告结语中指出：“根据现场的调查与证人证词及从死者身上所搜出的物件，均清楚地证明：一九五四年八月十七日三时三十分左右，有联合国军方面的三名武装军事人员非法越过军事分界线，进入朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面管辖下的非军事区内，袭击朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面的民政警察。”
