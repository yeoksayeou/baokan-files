    Shanghai's Twenty-Two Factories Under the Ministry of Light Industry
    Achieve Good Results with Unified Coal Supply in the First Half of the Year
    Starting from the first quarter of this year, the twenty-two factories in Shanghai under the Central Ministry of Light Industry changed their previous practice of purchasing coal from the market individually or transporting it from mines separately. The East China Office of the Ministry of Light Industry now handles the unified ordering, transportation, distribution, and regulation. The implementation of unified coal supply in the first half of the year not only saved more than 3 billion yuan in circulation costs but also saved manpower and reduced the cost of coal. For example, Lihua Paper Mill reduced its staff by two people, and the cost of coal was reduced by 12% compared to before.
    In the past, these twenty-two factories used seventeen or eighteen types of coal. After the unified coal supply, the types of coal were reduced to four, providing favorable conditions for technical exchanges on fuel coal. For example, Shanghai Cigarette Machinery Factory and Lihua Paper Mill are adjacent to each other but used different types of coal in the past, so they never had any contact. After unified coal usage, the more advanced coal-burning technology and consumption quotas of Shanghai Cigarette Machinery Factory were quickly promoted to Lihua Paper Mill.
    The full utilization of waterways for coal transportation in the first half of the year freed up more than 1,000 railway cars, allowing the railway to transport more important materials.
    In addition, the unified coal supply has played a positive role in flexible regulation, ensuring supply, reducing reserves, saving funds, and switching to lower-quality coal. (Hong Yinzhan)

    轻工业部所属上海二十二个工厂
    上半年实行统一供煤收到良好效果
    中央轻工业部所属上海二十二个工厂，从今年第一季度开始，改变了以前各自向市场购煤或单独去矿山提运的办法，由轻工业部华东办事处统一进行订货、提运、分配、调剂等工作。上半年实行统一供煤的结果，除节约了流转费三十多亿元外，还节省了人力，降低了煤的成本。如利华纸厂减少了两个工作人员，煤的成本较前降低了百分之十二。
    过去这二十二个厂用煤有十七、八种，统一供煤后，煤的种类减少到四种，为燃煤的技术交流提供了有利条件。如上烟机械厂与利华纸厂是毗邻，过去用煤不同，从不联系；统一用煤后，上烟机械厂比较先进的燃煤技术和消耗定额，很快就推广到利华纸厂。
    上半年充分利用水路运煤的结果，腾出了一千多个车皮，使铁路能多运输一些重要的物资。
    此外，统一供煤对灵活调剂、保证供应、减少储备、节约资金、改用低质煤等方面，都起了积极的作用。　（洪印展）
