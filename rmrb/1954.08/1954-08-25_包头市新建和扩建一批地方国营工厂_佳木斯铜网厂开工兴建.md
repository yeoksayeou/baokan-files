Baotou City Builds and Expands a Number of Local State-Owned Factories
Jiamusi Copper Mesh Factory Begins Construction
　　A number of new and expanded local state-owned factory projects in Baotou City have started construction successively in the first half of August.
　　The projects that have started include the construction of new mechanized brick and tile factories, auto repair shops, and wood product factories, as well as the expansion of machinery factories and leather factories. After the mechanized brick and tile factory is completed, it will use modern machinery to manufacture a large number of bricks and tiles to supply the needs of basic construction. After the auto repair shop is completed, it will ensure the smooth progress of transportation, and car repairs will no longer need to be sent to Beijing or Tianjin. In order to supply more machine parts, radiators, etc., the Baotou Machinery Factory is expanding its foundry workshop. In order to meet the needs of the people in Baotou and Inner Mongolia, the Baotou Leather Factory is expanding its chrome tanning workshop and shoe-making workshop.
　　These projects started smoothly with the active support of farmers in the suburbs of Baotou and the active preparations of construction workers. Now the construction workers at each site are working hard to break new quotas and ensure "good quality, speed, economy, and safety."

　　The Jiamusi Copper Mesh Factory of the Central Ministry of Light Industry officially started construction on August 9. The factory concentrates the advantages of existing copper mesh factories in the Soviet Union, adopts modern mesh-making methods, and the entire production process is mechanized and automated. Copper mesh is an important equipment for the paper industry. In the past, the copper mesh required by paper mills across the country relied on imports from abroad. After the factory is completed, it will guarantee the needs of domestic paper mills for precision copper mesh of various specifications.

    中央轻工业部佳木斯铜网厂在八月九日正式开工兴建。该厂集中了苏联现有铜网厂的优点，采用了现代化的制网方法，生产过程全部是机械化和自动化的。铜网是造纸工业的重要设备。过去我国各地造纸厂所需铜网均赖国外进口，该厂建成后将保证国内造纸厂各种规格的精密铜网的需要。
