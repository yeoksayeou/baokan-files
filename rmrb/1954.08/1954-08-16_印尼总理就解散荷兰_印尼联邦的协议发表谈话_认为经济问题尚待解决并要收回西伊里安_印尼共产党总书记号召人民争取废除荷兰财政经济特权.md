    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 13th. Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo expressed satisfaction to the press on the evening of the 11th regarding the agreement to dissolve the Netherlands-Indonesia Union. He said that with the abolition of the union, there would no longer be any political connection between Indonesia and the Netherlands. He believes that the economic problems between Indonesia and the Netherlands remain to be resolved, and the recovery of West Irian remains the demand of all Indonesians.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 13th. Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit issued a statement on the 12th regarding the agreement to dissolve the Netherlands-Indonesia Union, saying that the Indonesian delegation had successfully eliminated a part of the Round Table Conference Agreement. Due to this achievement, Indonesia had taken a step towards complete autonomy. He said, however, that the struggle to expel Dutch imperialism from Indonesia was far from complete. The Sastroamidjojo government and the Indonesian people still bear the important task of struggling to abolish the financial and economic privileges still retained by the Netherlands, to completely cancel the unreasonable "debts" imposed on Indonesia, and to recover West Irian. He called on the Indonesian people and the world's democratic forces to unite to achieve these goals.

    【新华社雅加达十三日电】印尼总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约十一日晚对报界发表谈话，对解散荷兰—印尼联邦的协议表示满意。他说，随着联邦的废除，印尼和荷兰之间再没有政治的联系。他认为，印尼和荷兰的经济问题还待解决，收回西伊里安仍然是印尼全民的要求。
    【新华社雅加达十三日电】印尼共产党总书记艾地十二日就解散荷兰—印尼联邦的协议发表声明说，印尼代表团成功地消除了圆桌会议协定的一部分，由于这一成就，印尼向完全自主前进了一步。他说，但是，从印尼驱除荷兰帝国主义的斗争还远远没有完成。沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府和印尼人民仍然负着重大的斗争任务——争取废除荷兰仍然保留的财政经济特权、完全取消加在印尼身上的不合理的“债务”和收回西伊里安。他号召印尼人民和世界民主力量团结一起来争取达到这些目的。
