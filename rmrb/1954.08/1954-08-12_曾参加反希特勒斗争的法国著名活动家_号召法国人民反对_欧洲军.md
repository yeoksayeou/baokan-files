Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 10th: TASS reports from Paris on August 10th: A group of French political and social activists who actively participated in the resistance against the Hitler occupation forces and fought for the liberation of the country have issued a notice to those who participated in the resistance movement during the war against Germany, calling on everyone to fight against the European Army.

The notice states: "Establishing the European Defense Community means that our country will lose its sovereignty, lose the possibility of economic development, and lose democracy and freedom. The European Defense Community will dismember the French army and then bring war. We do not want to arm Germany. We demand the conclusion of treaties of mutual assistance and collective security based on respect for the independence of all countries and the right to decide their own destiny. Such a treaty will be the beginning of reducing national armaments and supervising the state of armaments. Comrades and patriots who participated in the resistance against the enemy, regardless of your political, philosophical, or religious beliefs, unite and fight against the European Defense Community!"

The notice is signed by writer Louis Aragon, former minister Paul Bastid, member of parliament André Denis, “L'Aurore” editor-in-chief Domenach, French Communist Party Secretary Duclos, French General Confederation of Labor Secretary Frachon, member of parliament Le Pany, Admiral Moulec, General Marillier-Jouenneville, and other famous French activists.

    曾参加反希特勒斗争的法国著名活动家
    号召法国人民反对“欧洲军”
   【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社巴黎十日讯：曾积极参加反抗希特勒占领军、为解放国家而斗争的一批法国政治活动家和社会活动家向在对德战争中参加抵抗运动者的人们发表了一篇通告，号召大家为反对欧洲军而斗争。
    通告中写道：“建立起欧洲防务集团就意味着我国丧失主权、丧失经济发展的可能性，丧失民主和自由。欧洲防务集团将肢解法国军队，然后将带来战争。我们不愿武装德国。我们要求在尊重各国独立和决定自己命运的权利的条件下缔结互助和保障集体安全的条约。这种条约将是缩减各国军备和监督军备状况的一个开始。参加抗敌的同志们和爱国者们，不论你们具有那种政治信仰、哲学信仰和宗教信仰，大家团结起来为反对欧洲防务集团而奋斗！”
    在通告上署名的有作家路易·阿拉贡、前部长保罗·巴斯迪、议员安德烈·德尼、“灵报”总编辑多门纳克、法国共产党书记杜克洛、法国总工会总书记弗拉商、议员勒庞、海军上将摩利克、马里列—儒恩维尔将军和法国其他一些著名的活动家。
