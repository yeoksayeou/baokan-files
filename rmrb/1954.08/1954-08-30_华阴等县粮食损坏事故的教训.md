Short Commentary

The incident in which more than 300,000 jin of state grain was damaged by rain and water at Huaxian and Huayin railway stations and the grain departments of Huayin and other counties over a period of more than twenty days shows that some staff in state organs and enterprises, while verbally claiming to "cherish state property," actually lack a sense of responsibility towards it. This reflects bureaucracy, irresponsibility, and carelessness in their work, as well as individualistic and departmentalist thinking among some staff.

Huaxian Station was willing to unload grain in the rain in order to compete for the red flag. What these staff cared about and pursued was not the safety of state property and the needs of the people, but whether individuals and their units could obtain the "Outstanding Red Flag." When cadres from the Huayin County Grain Department went to the station to pick up the grain, they ignored the fact that the batch of water-damaged grain had been mistakenly transported to Huayin. An Pandou, the stationmaster of Huaxian Station, believed that the stationmaster should not be held responsible for the damaged grain. In his view, his main task was simply to transport the grain from here to there, and any damage caused by rain or other losses was completely unrelated to him. Clearly, if this kind of individualism and departmentalism is not overcome, state grain or any other assets cannot be reliably protected.

The departments in charge of grain in each county should have made necessary plans for the transportation and storage of grain, made necessary preparations and organizational arrangements, and regularly educated staff on cherishing state grain. However, the grain departments in Huayin and other counties lacked planning and the necessary preparation and organizational work. The Dali County Grain Department sent only a young cadre with no experience in grain reception to receive 240,000 jin of glutinous rice. Before he left, they did not remind him to be careful about preventing rain and moisture. When it suddenly rained, the young cadre actively tried to borrow tarpaulins and drain the water, but it was too late. It is clear that whether grain can avoid being rained on mainly depends on whether rain prevention preparations are made; and the responsibility for doing a good job in rain prevention lies with the department in charge of grain. Some people say that so much grain cannot possibly be covered. This is incorrect. Precisely because there is so much grain, even more preparation should be made for rain prevention. If the responsible authorities had made preparations early, such an accident could have been completely avoided. But from the reports, this preparation was lacking.

The lack of leadership and inspection of grain work by Party and government organs is also an important reason for the accidents. The Huayin County People's Government Grain Department's directly affiliated warehouse and Huayin Station damaged state grain several times, but the CPC Huayin County Committee did not take appropriate measures. The county Party secretary once thought that "the problem in the county was not big," and also said that the station was not under the leadership of the county Party committee, as if these were all reasons why state grain could be damaged. After the accident, the Weinan Prefectural Grain Department only reported the matter to the higher authorities and did not seriously investigate the cause and responsibility, or come up with ways to eliminate or prevent such accidents in the future. Therefore, even though official documents are flying up and down, accidents will continue to occur.

In order to learn from these lessons, improve the transportation and storage of grain, and effectively protect state grain, we believe that Party and government organs must strengthen their leadership over the grain and transportation departments in the future, especially strengthening socialist ideological education for staff. In the process of transporting grain, grain departments must make thorough rain prevention preparations and assign experienced cadres to carry out the work; at the same time, they should also pay attention to improving storage methods. Because there is a lot of rain and the air is humid this year, grain is prone to mold and spoilage, so it is necessary to constantly check the quality of the grain and promptly rescue unsafe grain. Transportation departments must change their purely task-oriented view and, in certain special circumstances, must assist grain departments in solving various difficulties. Supervisory and procuratorial organs should also strengthen supervision and inspection of grain and transportation departments, and propose necessary disciplinary measures for derelict staff. Those lawbreakers and derelicts who have caused serious losses to state grain must be punished, otherwise state property cannot be reliably protected.

### 华阴等县粮食损坏事故的教训

    华阴等县粮食损坏事故的教训
    华县、华阴等火车站和华阴等县粮食科在二十多天中使国家粮食三十多万斤遭到雨淋水湿的事件，说明国家机关和企业机关中有一部分工作人员虽然口头上会说“爱护国家财产”，实际对国家财产却是很缺乏责任心的。这反映出工作上的官僚主义、不负责任和粗枝大叶现象，也反映出有些工作人员有着个人主义和本位主义思想。
    华县车站为了争红旗而宁愿把粮食卸在雨地。这些工作人员所关心的和追求的，不是国家财产的安全和人民的需要，而是个人和本单位是否能得到“优胜红旗”。华阴县粮食科干部上车站接粮的时候，发现这批被水浸湿的粮食是错运到华阴来的，他们就置之不理。华县车站站长安攀斗认为损坏了粮食不应该找站长，在他看来，他的主要任务只是把粮食从这里运到那里，至于粮食遭受雨淋水湿或其他损失，则是完全与他无关的。很明显，如果不克服这种个人主义和本位主义思想，国家的粮食或其他任何资财就不能得到可靠的保护。
    各县主管粮食的部门，本来应该对粮食的调运、保管等工作做出必要的计划，作好必要的准备工作和组织工作，并且对工作人员经常进行爱护国家粮食的教育。但是华阴等县的粮食主管部门却缺乏计划性，也缺乏应有的准备工作和组织工作。大荔县粮食科要接二十四万斤糯米，只派出一位毫无接粮经验的年轻干部。出发以前也没有叮嘱他注意防雨防湿。突然下雨了，这个年轻干部虽然积极地多方寻借帆布，冒雨排水，但已经来不及了。可见粮食能否避免雨淋，主要还是看有没有作好防雨准备；而作好防雨工作的责任，则是属于主管粮食的部门的。有的人说，这么多的粮食，怎么也遮不过来。这是不对的。正因为粮食这么多，才更应该作好防雨准备。如果负责机关早作准备，这样的事故是完全可以避免的。但从报道中看，这种准备是没有的。
    党政机关对粮食工作缺乏领导检查，也是发生事故的重要原因。华阴县人民政府粮食科直属仓库和华阴车站几次损坏国家粮食，中共华阴县委会并没有采取应有的措施。县委书记曾认为县上“问题不大”，又说车站不属于县委领导，似乎这些都成了可以使国家粮食遭受损失的理由。渭南专署粮食科在事故发生之后，只是向上呈报了事，也没有认真检查原因和责任，想出今后杜绝或防止这类事故的办法。因此，尽管你公文上下飞舞，而事故却仍然会不断发生。
    为了接受这些教训，改善粮食的调运和保管工作，有效地保护国家粮食，我们认为今后党政机关必须加强对粮食部门和运输部门的领导，特别是加强对工作人员的社会主义思想教育。粮食部门在调运粮食过程中，必须做好周密的防雨准备，并配备有经验的干部进行工作；同时还应注意改进保管方法。由于今年雨水多，空气潮湿，粮食容易霉坏，所以必须不断地检查粮食的质量，及时抢救不安全的粮食。运输部门要改变单纯的任务观点，在某些特殊情况下，必须协助粮食部门解决各种困难。监察机关和检察机关，也要加强对粮食部门和运输部门的监督和检查，对失职的工作人员提出必要的处分意见。对于使国家粮食遭到严重损失的违法失职分子，则必须给以制裁，否则国家的财产就得不到可靠的保障。
