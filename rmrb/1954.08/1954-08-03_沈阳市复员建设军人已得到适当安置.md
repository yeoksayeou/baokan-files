    Shenyang City has accepted many demobilized construction soldiers to participate in national economic construction over the past year. These demobilized construction soldiers have now basically been appropriately settled. Among them, 70 percent who live in cities have been assigned to industrial and commercial production departments according to their personal wishes and their own conditions; 30 percent who live in rural areas have participated in agricultural production.
    Among these demobilized construction soldiers, many labor models and advanced workers have emerged on the production front, and have been valued by factories, enterprises, and organs, and welcomed by the people. Wang Dasheng, a lathe operator in the machine repair group of Shenyang No. 6 Paper Mill and a revolutionary disabled soldier, has always been conscientious and responsible in his work and able to overcome difficulties. When high-speed steel lathe tools were lacking, he tried to use substitutes, which improved production efficiency and ensured product quality. Recently, he created an automatic paper selection and counting machine, which has shown good results after testing. He has been commended and rewarded by the factory three times each and has been named a labor model of Shenyang City this year. Among the 39 demobilized construction soldiers in the Shenyang Textile Factory, 16 have been commended and rewarded by the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, the Beishi District People's Government, and the factory. Zhang Tingyi, who serves as the secretary of the Communist Party branch and deputy manager of the No. 2 Store of Shenyang Department Store, often studies and supports the rationalization proposals of employees, and promotes advanced experiences such as the "joint shift system" and the "group responsibility system", creating great achievements in his work, and was therefore named a labor model in the city's commercial system, and the store where he works was also named one of the advanced stores in Shenyang City. Su Paoyi, a revolutionary disabled soldier in the Baitapu sub-district of the city suburbs, who was named a model for preventing spies, maintaining public security, and working, actively participated in the construction of village political power, promptly reported situations to the public security organs, and arrested counter-revolutionaries; he also played a great role in training militiamen, and six militiamen have been trained by him to become cadres and participate in the work of the CPC District Committee and the public security departments.
    The organs, factories, and enterprises in Shenyang City are all serious and responsible in the work of settling demobilized construction soldiers, and treat it as a political task. The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory has attached importance to preferential treatment work for several years, and often conducts education on remembering the source of water and respecting soldiers among employees; when the personnel department receives employees, it pays attention to giving priority to demobilized construction soldiers under the same conditions, without a probationary period, and also provides care for individual employees with relatively poor physical conditions.

    沈阳市复员建设军人已得到适当安置
      一年来，沈阳市接受了许多复员建设军人参加国家经济建设。这批复员建设军人现在基本上都已得到了适当的安置。其中百分之七十家住在城市的，都按个人志愿及其本身条件，安置到工业和商业等生产部门；百分之三十家住在农村的，都参加了农业生产。
    在这些复员建设军人中，涌现出不少生产战线上的劳动模范和先进工作者，受到了各工厂，企业、机关的重视和人民群众的欢迎。沈阳第六造纸厂机修组车工、革命残废军人王大胜，工作一贯认真负责，能克服困难，在锋钢车刀缺少时，他曾设法利用代替品，并提高了生产效率和保证了产品质量。最近，他又创造出自动选纸、数纸机，经过试验效果良好。他曾先后受到工厂三次表扬，三次奖励，今年已被评为沈阳市劳动模范。沈阳纺织厂的三十九名复员建设军人中，有十六名曾受到沈阳市人民政府、北市区人民政府和工厂的表扬和奖励。在沈阳百货公司第二商店担任共产党支部书记兼副经理工作的张廷议，经常研究和支持职工的合理化建议，推广了“连带上班制”、“小组责任制”等先进经验，在工作上创造很大成绩，因此被评为全市商业系统的劳动模范，他所在的商店也被评为沈阳市先进商店之一。被评为防奸、治安、工作模范的市郊白塔铺分区革命残废军人苏脬义，积极参加村政权建设，及时向公安机关反映情况，逮捕了反革命分子；在训练民兵工作中，他也起了很大作用，已有六名民兵经他培养为干部参加了中共区委和公安部门的工作。
    沈阳市各机关、工厂、企业单位在安置复员建设军人工作中都很认真、负责，把它当作一项政治任务进行。沈阳重型机器厂几年来重视优抚工作，对职工经常进行饮水思源尊敬军人的教育；人事部门在接收职工时，对复员建设军人注意在同等条件下优先采用，无试用期，并对个别身体条件较差的也给以照顾。　（新华社）
