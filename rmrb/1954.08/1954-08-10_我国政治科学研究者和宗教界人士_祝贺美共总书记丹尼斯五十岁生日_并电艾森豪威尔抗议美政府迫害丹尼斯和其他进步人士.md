Xinhua News Agency, August 9th. Nineteen Chinese political science researchers sent telegrams to the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States and the General Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, Dennis, on August 7th to congratulate Dennis on his fiftieth birthday. On the same day, Chinese political science researchers also telegraphed US President Eisenhower, protesting the US government's persecution of Dennis and other American progressives who are fighting for peace and democracy, and demanding the immediate release of Dennis and other political prisoners.
The Chinese political science researchers, in their telegram to the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, congratulated the Communist Party of the United States on its further achievements in the struggle for peace and the democratic rights of the American people. The telegram also included the full text of the congratulatory telegram to Dennis and the protest telegram to Eisenhower.
The telegram to Dennis said: "Dear Comrade Dennis: Under the barbaric persecution policy of the American government, you have been innocently imprisoned in Atlanta Prison for more than three years. In order to implement its foreign aggression policy, the American government is implementing a fascist rule internally, abandoning the American people's tradition of democracy and freedom, and frantically persecuting all thoughtful, kind and upright progressives in the United States, including the vanguard of the American working class—members and leaders of the Communist Party of the United States. This policy of the American government is not only resolutely opposed by the American people, but also by progressive humanity who loves peace all over the world. We, the Chinese political science researchers, express our high respect, deep concern and sympathy for the heroic struggle you and your comrades are carrying out in extremely difficult circumstances. On the occasion of your fiftieth birthday, we send our congratulations and condolences. The people of the world will always stand with you and the American people."
The protest telegram to Eisenhower said: "On the occasion of the fiftieth birthday of Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, we, the Chinese political science researchers, strongly protest the US government's continued illegal imprisonment of Dennis and other American progressives who are fighting for peace and democracy. We demand that you stop the persecution of American progressives and immediately release Dennis and other political prisoners."
The telegrams were signed by: Shen Junru, Wang Kunlun, Zhang Zhiran, Xu Deheng, Lan Gongwu, Pan Zhenya, Wang Feiran, Zhou Gengsheng, Wang Zhixiang, Dai Xiuzan, Chen Tiqiang, Zhu Qiwen, Qian Duansheng, Fei Qing, Lei Jieqiong, Mei Ru'ao, He Sijing, Wang Tieya, and Lou Bangyan.
