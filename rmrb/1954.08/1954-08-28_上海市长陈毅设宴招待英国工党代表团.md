He said: Over the past five years, the people of Shanghai have done a great deal of work for the restoration and development of economic, cultural, and educational undertakings. Through your extensive contact with people from all walks of life in Shanghai during this visit, you will be able to see the results of this labor of the Shanghai people, and how profoundly it is changing the face of our city. At the same time, you will also feel how strong the common will of the Shanghai people for peace is. We believe that this visit by the British Labour Party delegation will play a positive role in Sino-British friendship and world peace.
    In his reply, Attlee expressed his gratitude for the host's reception. He said: We and you all very much hope to promote peace, and we feel that the best way to promote peace is for different peoples to cooperate together so that everyone can understand each other more. He said: I am very happy to be in Shanghai today. Looking out of the window, it seems like being in London. Shanghai and London are both cities with very developed commerce, which makes me think that China and Britain should trade on a large scale. Our biggest hope for this visit to China is to promote Sino-British friendship and world peace as a result.
    The banquet proceeded in a friendly atmosphere from beginning to end.
