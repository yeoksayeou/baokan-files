Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 26th: Farmers in the broad non-disaster areas of Hubei Province have mostly completed their work of interplanting and intercropping late autumn crops in dry land, in order to strive for an extra harvest. Enshi Prefecture had already successfully completed the planting plan for increasing grain production by 120 million catties by early August. On the basis of further tapping potential, they have proposed a plan to increase production by another 80 million catties of grain. In Xiangyang Prefecture, 80 percent of the farmland planned for intercropping and catch-cropping has been planted with late autumn crops such as soybeans, late millet, mud beans, and late sesame, which are estimated to increase grain production by about 230 million catties. Yichang Prefecture has also completed 70 percent of its plan for planting late autumn crops.

Interplanting and intercropping in dry land is one of the important measures for farmers in Hubei Province to increase grain production by 2 billion catties this year.

Before sowing, many areas systematically summarized past experiences in interplanting and intercropping, studied cultivation methods, and, with the help of the state, farmers received sufficient seeds in a timely manner, so the planting area was expanded compared to the past. At present, most of the late autumn crops that were sown earlier have sprouted and turned green, and farmers are carefully cultivating, transplanting, and replanting to ensure full seedlings. Enshi and other places have also organized a large number of cadres to go deep into villages, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid groups to carry out specific inspection work to ensure the in-depth development of the agricultural production increase movement.
Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed Party committees at all levels to lead the broad masses of farmers to make persistent efforts to continue to overcome various natural disasters and strengthen production and disaster relief work.

The Provincial Committee pointed out that since the beginning of summer, Party organizations at all levels have led the broad masses of farmers in stubbornly persisting in the fight against flood prevention, drainage, seedling protection, and increased production, ensuring that most areas were not affected by disasters. At present, the weather has cleared, and the late growth of major autumn crops has improved. The autumn rice in areas that were once flooded has also recovered rapidly after drainage. However, we must not become complacent because of this. The Huai River flood is still flowing downstream, and natural disasters such as wind, insects, and drought in high-lying areas may occur. Party committees at all levels must make persistent efforts to overcome various natural disasters, vigorously implement various measures to increase grain production, and make increasing grain production a conscious movement of the masses, ensuring the completion of the province's annual agricultural production plan. The Provincial Committee requires Party committees at all levels in areas that have not been flooded to educate farmers, raise socialist consciousness, support national construction and the people in disaster areas, tap production potential, increase yields per unit area, and strive to grow one more crop, ensuring the overfulfillment of the plan to increase grain production. In areas that have been heavily flooded, we must deeply lead farmers to vigorously drain water to protect seedlings or replant in a timely manner, and strive to complete or overfulfill the original production plan. In areas that have been severely flooded in some parts, we must strive to reduce production as little as possible. Low-lying areas with excessive water accumulation should drain the water as soon as possible to avoid delaying the autumn planting.

The Provincial Committee instructed Party committees at all levels to attach importance to disaster relief work in disaster-stricken areas while striving to complete the annual agricultural production plan. Although people's governments at all levels have properly resettled disaster victims, and disaster victims also have summer harvest grains to eat, and the immediate difficulties are not great, some disaster areas will lose their autumn crops, and there will be great difficulties in production and life in the future. Party committees at all levels in disaster-stricken areas should take disaster relief work as an important task at present. In the severely affected areas, we should put production for disaster relief as the central task overriding everything else, implement the principle of self-reliance through production, formulate a comprehensive production and disaster relief plan for the autumn and winter, and especially rely on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, unite individual farmers, overcome various difficulties in self-reliance through production, and finally overcome natural disasters.

    湖北非灾区农民积极间种套种晚秋作物
    中共江苏省委指示各地加强生产救灾工作
    【新华社武昌二十六日电】湖北省广大非灾区农民为争取多收一季，在旱地里间种套种晚秋作物的工作已大部完成。恩施专区八月上旬即完满地实现了增产一亿二千万斤粮食的播种计划，他们在进一步挖掘潜力的基础上，又提出了再增产八千万斤粮食的计划。襄阳专区计划套种抢种的农田，已有百分之八十种上了?豆、晚粟、泥豆、晚芝麻等晚秋作物，估计可增产粮食二亿三千万斤左右。宜昌专区也已完成了播种晚秋作物计划的百分之七十。
    旱地里间种套种是湖北省农民今年增产二十亿斤粮食的重要措施之一。
    在播种以前，很多地区有计划地总结了过去的间种套种的经验，研究了耕作方法，在国家帮助下，农民及时地得到了充足的种子，因而播种面积比过去扩大。目前播种较早的晚秋作物大多已出芽发青，农民正在精心培育、移补、保证全苗。恩施等地并组织了大批干部深入乡村、农业生产合作社和互助组进行具体检查工作，保证农业增产运动的深入开展。
   【新华社南京讯】中共江苏省委员会指示各级党委领导广大农民再接再厉继续战胜各种自然灾害，加强生产救灾工作。
    省委指出：入夏以来，党的各级组织领导广大农民顽强坚持防汛排涝保苗增产斗争，保证了绝大部分地区没有成灾。目前，天已放晴，大秋作物后期生长转好，一度受涝的地区在排水以后秋禾也迅速恢复生长。但不能因此而产生麻痹思想。江淮洪水仍在下注，风、虫和高地干旱等自然灾害都可能发生。各级党委要再接再厉战胜各种自然灾害，大力贯彻增产粮食的各项措施，使增产粮食成为群众自觉运动，保证完成全省的全年农业生产计划。省委要求没有受涝的地区的各级党委教育农民，提高社会主义觉悟，支援国家建设和灾区人民，挖掘生产潜力，提高单位面积产量，争取多种一熟作物，保证超额完成增产粮食的计划。在受涝较重地区要深入领导农民大力排水保苗或及时改种，力争完成或超额完成原订生产计划。部分受涝严重地区，要力争少减产。个别积水过深的低洼地区要早日排除积水，做到不误秋种。
    省委指示各级党委，在争取完成全年农业生产计划的同时，还要切实重视受灾地区的救灾工作。各级人民政府虽然对灾民已作了妥善安置，灾民也有夏收粮食可吃，眼前困难不大，但部分灾区秋季作物失收，今后生产和生活上会发生很大困难。受灾地区各级党委应将救灾工作作为当前一项重要的任务。受灾严重的地区更应把救灾生产作为压倒一切的中心，贯彻生产自救方针，制订秋冬期间全面的生产救灾计划，特别要依靠互助合作组织，团结单干农民，克服生产自救中的各种困难，最后战胜自然灾害。
