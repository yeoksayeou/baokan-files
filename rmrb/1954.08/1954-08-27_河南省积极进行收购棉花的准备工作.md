Henan Province Actively Prepares for Cotton Procurement

Henan Province is expected to have a bumper cotton harvest this year, and the cotton pre-purchase target has already been exceeded. In order to do a good job in cotton procurement after the autumn harvest, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Henan Provincial People's Government has organized relevant units to make preparations for cotton procurement in advance.

While recovering the pre-purchased wheat, all localities have universally conducted a review of the cotton pre-purchase contracts. Through the review, the phenomena of chaotic deposits, chaotic organization, and chaotic procedures that originally existed in some areas have been basically overcome. Many grassroots cooperatives have sorted out the reviewed contracts and formulated procurement and processing plans based on the cotton sales dates and quantities in the contracts.

Relevant departments have carried out the work of adjusting institutions, allocating cadres, and training personnel. In the cooperative system, organizations for managing cotton have been rebuilt and adjusted from the provincial to the county level. Grassroots cooperatives have planned to set up a number of cotton purchasing points based on the principles of being convenient for farmers and meeting economic accounting requirements, and have transferred a group of full-time cadres. The Henan Provincial Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Corporation is fully preparing funds according to the cooperatives' cotton purchasing plan, and has increased the number of cotton handover points by four compared to last year. The Cotton Quality Inspection Bureau organized relevant units to produce 400 sets of standard seed cotton samples, and trained 1,597 graders and 752 accountants.

In order to organize the strength of all relevant parties to jointly do a good job in cotton procurement, the Henan Provincial Financial and Economic Committee convened a meeting on August 8th with relevant units such as the financial and economic committees, industrial and commercial administration departments, cotton yarn and fabric companies, and cooperatives of various special districts and counties, clarifying the policies and practices for cotton procurement this year. After the meeting, cooperatives, grain departments, and other departments in various localities have actively launched work to prepare manpower and equipment, and organize the supply of materials.

    河南省积极进行收购棉花的准备工作
    河南省今年棉花丰收有望，棉花预购任务也已经超额完成。河南省人民政府财政经济委员会为了作好秋后收购棉花的工作，组织各有关单位提前进行购棉准备工作。
    各地在收回预购小麦的同时，普遍进行了复查棉花预购合同的工作。通过复查，基本上克服了部分地区原来存在的定金乱、组织乱、手续乱的现象。不少基层合作社已经把经过复查的合同整理完毕，并根据合同中的售棉日期和数量，制订了收购和加工计划。
    各有关部门进行了调整机构、配备干部、训练人员的工作。合作社系统，由省到县改建和调整了经营棉花的机构；基层合作社在既便利农民又符合经济核算要求的原则下，有计划地设置了一批棉花收购点，并调配了一批专职干部。中国花纱布公司河南省公司正根据合作社的收购棉花计划，充分准备资金，并将棉花交接点在去年的基础上增加了四个。棉质检验局组织有关单位仿制籽棉标准四百套，训练分级人员一千五百九十七名、会计七百五十二名。
    为了组织各有关方面的力量，共同作好购棉工作，河南省财委在八月八日召集各专区和县的财委、工商行政部门、花纱布公司、合作社等有关单位开会，说清了今年收购棉花的政策和作法。会后，各地合作社、粮食等部门已积极展开准备人力、用具，组织供应物资等工作。　（姚福年）
