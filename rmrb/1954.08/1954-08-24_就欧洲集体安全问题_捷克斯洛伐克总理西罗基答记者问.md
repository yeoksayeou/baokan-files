    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 21st: The Prague newspapers published Czechoslovak Premier Viliam Široký's replies to questions posed by Wilfred Burchett, a reporter for the French newspaper "l'Humanité," on the issue of European collective security.
    Answering the question of whether new factors have emerged that would contribute to the realization of the idea of an all-European treaty guaranteeing European collective security, Široký said: First of all, it should be pointed out that the successful outcome of the Geneva Conference has eased the general political atmosphere in the world and convincingly proved that even the most complex problems can be resolved through negotiation, provided that both sides are sincere. The proposals put forward by the Soviet government in its note to the Western countries on July 24 and its statement to the Western countries on August 4 are important new steps in solving the problem of guaranteeing European peace and security. The Czechoslovak government and all its people warmly and firmly support the Soviet proposal to convene a four-power preparatory meeting to continue discussions on the German question. They are determined to do their utmost to ensure that the conference to discuss European collective security is convened and is crowned with success.
    Regarding the role that a European collective security treaty could play in the development of economic cooperation between countries, Široký replied: A European collective security treaty would lay a new foundation for economic cooperation between all European countries, open the door for a wide exchange of goods and mutual cooperation for all European countries, and bring them great benefits.
    Answering the question of what benefits the people of Europe, especially the people of Western Europe, could derive from a collective security treaty, Široký said: The main threat to the security of the people of European countries, both in the past and now, has been German militarism. News from West Germany indicates that some people are working to revive the German Wehrmacht, and they even make no secret of their aggressive intentions to attack Germany's western and eastern neighbors. These people see the so-called "European Defense Community" precisely as a way to achieve their goals. But the conclusion of an effective collective security treaty can free the people of Western European countries from this threat and guarantee their security.
    Široký concluded by saying that every step taken by France in this regard, as well as in guaranteeing its own security, will receive the deep understanding and warm sympathy of the Czechoslovak people.

    就欧洲集体安全问题
    捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基答记者问
    【新华社二十二日讯】　据塔斯社布拉格二十一日讯：布拉格各报刊载了捷克斯洛伐克总理威廉·西罗基对法国“人道报”记者韦尔弗雷德·巴格特就欧洲集体安全问题所提问题的答复。
    在回答现在是否出现了有助于实现保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约这一主张的新因素时，西罗基说：首先应当指出的是：日内瓦会议的圆满结果使世界的普遍政治气氛有了缓和，并且令人信服地证明，只要双方有诚意，甚至最复杂的问题也可以通过协商获得解决。苏联政府在七月二十四日致西方国家的照会和八月四日致西方国家的声明中提出的建议，是解决保障欧洲和平和安全问题的重要的新步骤。捷克斯洛伐克政府和全体人民热烈地、坚决地拥护苏联关于召开四国预备会议以继续讨论德国问题的建议。他们决定尽力促使讨论欧洲集体安全问题的会议得以召开并圆满成功。
    对于欧洲集体安全条约对发展各国之间的经济合作能起什么作用的问题，西罗基回答说：欧洲集体安全条约能为欧洲所有国家之间的经济合作打下新的基础，能为欧洲所有国家打开广泛交流商品和互相合作的大门，并为它们带来巨大的利益。
    在回答欧洲各国人民、特别是西欧各国的人民能从集体安全条约中得到什么好处这个问题时，西罗基说：欧洲各国人民安全的主要威胁过去和现在一直是德国军国主义。从西德传出的消息说明，有人在致力于复活德国国防军，他们甚至毫不掩饰他们要进攻德国西面和东面邻国的侵略目的。这些人正是把所谓“欧洲防务集团”看作是实现自己的目的的道路。但是缔结一个有效的集体安全条约就可以使西欧各国的人民摆脱这一威胁，使他们的安全得到保障。
    西罗基最后说：法国在这方面以及在为保障自己的安全方面所采取的每一个步骤都会得到捷克斯洛伐克人民的深刻的谅解和热烈的同情。
