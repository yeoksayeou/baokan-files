Northeastern State-run Mechanical Farms
Dispatch Over 200 Combine Harvesters to Rush-Harvest Wheat

    Since the beginning of August, state-run mechanical farms in northeastern China have dispatched over 200 combine harvesters to rush-harvest wheat. Currently, the farms are nearing completion of harvesting over 24,000 hectares of wheat. The Baoquanling Farm has an average yield of 1.3 tons per hectare. The Chahaiyang Farm's unit area yield for over 1,200 hectares of wheat is expected to increase by 20% compared to last year. The Jiusan Farm, having suffered from wind and rainstorms, experienced lodging in 40% of its wheat. They immediately installed raking teeth on the wooden turning wheels of the combine harvesters to lift the lodged wheat before harvesting, and modified 15 combine harvesters into swathers for flexible operation, ensuring a bountiful harvest.

    The 7,600-plus hectares of spring wheat sown by the state-run Jiusan Mechanical Farm this year have yielded a comprehensive bumper harvest. According to predictions, the average yield per hectare will be at least 2,300 *jin*, and the farm will produce a total of 9,000 tons of high-quality wheat for the nation this year.
    All 62 combine harvesters and 45 tractors of the farm have been dispatched together to rush-harvest the wheat, and the sounds of combine harvesters and tractor engines resound everywhere in the fields. More than 30 large trucks shuttle back and forth between the wheat fields and the threshing grounds, and the golden wheat harvested by the combine harvesters has already piled up like mountains on the threshing grounds.　　　　(Ding Lüshu)

    东北北部各国营机械农场
    出动二百多台联合收割机抢收小麦
    东北北部各国营机械农场自八月初以来，出动了二百余台联合收割机抢收小麦。目前，各农场的二万四千余公顷小麦即将割收完毕。宝泉岭农场平均每公顷产量一点三吨。查哈阳农场一千二百多公顷小麦，单位面积产量可比去年提高二成。九三农场因受暴风雨侵袭，有百分之四十小麦倒伏，他们立即在联合收割机的木翻轮上安装扒齿，将倒伏的小麦扶起后再割，并改装十五台联合收割机为割晒机，以便灵活运转，保证了丰产丰收。

    国营九三机械农场今年播种的七千六百多公顷春小麦全面丰收。根据预测，平均每公顷至少可产两千三百余市斤，全场今年共可为国家生产九千吨品质优良的小麦。
    全场六十二架联合收割机和四十五台拖拉机，已一齐出动，抢收小麦，原野上到处响遍了联合收割机和拖拉机的马达声。三十多辆大汽车，往返奔跑于麦田与晒麦场之间，联合收割机收下的金黄色的小麦，已在晒麦场上堆积成山。　　　　（丁履枢）
