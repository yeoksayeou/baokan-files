    Expanding the Results of Ideological Discussion

    After the publicity of the General Line, many peasants' awareness has improved, and they have a preliminary understanding of the road to agricultural development. However, some peasants do not have a sufficient understanding of some specific policies, and even have some misunderstandings. Therefore, after the newspapers have pointed out the general direction to the peasants, they also need to educate the peasants to specifically draw a clear line between policies, eliminate their various ideological doubts, and encourage their enthusiasm to participate in production, mutual aid and cooperation.

    The discussion on the two roads in the countryside conducted by the Ningxia Daily from late February to mid-May this year clarified the direction of rural economic development for the vast number of peasants and strengthened their confidence in taking the socialist road. After the discussion, in order to consolidate the peasants' understanding and confidence and to encourage their enthusiasm, the newspaper, in four articles summarizing the ideological discussion, specifically helped the peasants to draw a clear policy line between commerce and sideline occupations, grain speculation and mutual exchange, usury and capital accommodation, and the exploitation of hired labor and labor exchange assistance. For example, in the article "Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations Can Engage in Legitimate Sideline Production, and Should Not Be Treated as Speculative Activities," the newspaper clarified the difference between commercial activities and sideline production through specific facts, stating that the former puts agricultural production in a secondary position and is purely an activity pursuing capitalist profits, while the latter is a sideline labor that utilizes surplus agricultural labor and is subordinate to agricultural production. Therefore, the planting of cash crops and vegetables cannot be opposed as "spontaneous forces" or "ideas of getting rich by crooked means." It goes without saying that the newspaper's approach is very beneficial in improving peasants' understanding of policies and production enthusiasm, or in consolidating and expanding the results of this ideological discussion.

    扩大思想讨论的成果
    经过总路线的宣传以后，很多农民的觉悟有了提高，初步认识了农业发展的道路。但是有些农民对一些具体政策，还不够了解，甚至还有某种误解。因此，报纸在向农民指出了总的方向以后，还需要教育农民具体地划清政策界限，消除他们的各种思想疑虑，鼓舞他们参加生产互助合作的积极性。
    宁夏日报在今年二月下旬至五月中旬进行的农村中两条道路的讨论，使广大农民明确了农村经济发展的方向，坚定了走社会主义道路的信心。讨论结束后，报纸为了巩固农民的认识和信心，鼓舞农民的积极性，又在四篇思想讨论总结的文章中，具体地帮助农民划清了商业与副业、粮食投机与互通有无、高利贷与资金调剂、雇工剥削与变工互助之间的政策界限。如在“互助合作组织可以搞正当的副业生产，不应当作投机买卖”一文中，报纸通过具体事实阐明了商业活动和副业生产的区别，在于前者是把农业生产置于次要地位，而单纯追求资本主义利润的活动，后者则是利用农业剩余劳力，并且服从于农业生产的一种副业劳动。因此，不能把种植经济作物和蔬菜也当作“自发势力”、“发横财思想”来反对。不用说，报纸这种作法，在提高农民对政策的认识和生产积极性方面，或在巩固和扩大这一思想讨论的成果方面，都是很有好处的。
