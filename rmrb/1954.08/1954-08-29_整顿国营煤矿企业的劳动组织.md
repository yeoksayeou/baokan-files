Rectifying the Labor Organization of State-Owned Coal Mining Enterprises
Yang Yi, Director of the Labor and Wage Department, Ministry of Fuel Industry

Labor organization work is an important part of enterprise management. Its task is to rationally organize the labor force based on the enterprise's production characteristics, equipment conditions, and production procedures and operating methods; to fix workers in specific jobs; to conduct well-ordered and rhythmic production with close mutual connections; to ensure that each worker understands their responsibilities; to develop their production enthusiasm and work responsibility; to continuously improve technical levels and improve operating methods; and to ensure the continuous improvement of enterprise labor productivity and the continuous reduction of costs, in order to comprehensively fulfill or over fulfill the state plan.

Due to the constantly changing production conditions in the coal mining industry, labor organization work is relatively complex and heavy. Although some rectification work has been carried out in coal mines in various places in recent years, and the labor organization of mining and tunneling faces has been initially improved, and the efficiency of mining and tunneling has been improved, there are still many problems. In many mines, no one has been in charge of labor organization work for a long time, and the various chaotic conditions in coal mine labor organization have seriously hindered the improvement of labor productivity and the continuous reduction of costs, affecting the completion of the state plan.

The most prominent problems in the labor organization of state-owned coal mines at present are: the proportion of non-industrial personnel is too large, and the allocation of personnel is extremely unreasonable. In 1953, non-industrial personnel in state-owned coal mines accounted for an average of about 32 percent of the production personnel, and individual units accounted for more than 50 percent, which has led to many phenomena of overstaffing within the enterprise. According to a survey of several mining bureaus, idleness in production workshops is generally more than 10 percent. For example, the Fushun Mining Bureau's office machinery section allocated 21 percent of its workers as substitutes, and some of these workers had nothing to do after going to work and simply slept; the miscellaneous work team of the Longfeng Mine sometimes had more than 40 people with nothing to do. Even more serious is that on the one hand, there is idleness, and on the other hand, overtime is required due to insufficient personnel, causing great losses to the state. In 1953 alone, the Fushun office's transportation and machinery sections spent more than 1.9 billion yuan in overtime pay. If labor organization were adjusted, such huge losses could be completely avoided. Due to too many personnel, unreasonable organization, and idleness and waste, the improvement of labor productivity is directly affected. In the first quarter of 1954, due to excessive personnel and unreasonable allocation, many mining bureaus completed or over fulfilled the output task, but the efficiency only completed 69 to 95 percent of the plan. Due to the large management structure of coal mining enterprises, overlapping levels, and unreasonable allocation of personnel, technical cadres are mostly concentrated in the upper-level institutions, which makes the on-site technical management force very weak.

The abnormality of coal mine labor organization is also manifested in the large and frequent flow of labor in enterprises. In the first quarter of 1954, the number of production workers who voluntarily resigned from national coal mines accounted for 5 percent of the enterprise's registered workers (individual units even reached more than 27 percent), while the number of new workers added from outside the enterprise accounted for 6.4 percent of the registered workers (individual units reached 39 percent). More serious is that the proportion of technical workers flowing is large. For example, in 1953, mining and tunneling workers and mechanical and electrical workers in the Laohutai Mine of the Fushun Bureau accounted for 53 percent of the mobile workers, which seriously weakened the key production departments. The internal flow of production workers in coal mines is also extremely frequent. For example, the number of water and sand filling workers in the Xiba Pit of Fuxin was transferred in and out 85 times in one month, and the number of people transferred accounted for 36.5 percent of all workers registered in the pit. Due to the outflow of technical workers and the large increase of new workers, the proportion of technical workers in the existing workers has decreased, and the proportion of new workers has increased. For example, in 1953, mining and tunneling workers with less than one year of work experience in Hegang accounted for 32 percent of the total mining and tunneling workers, and new workers in some sites reached 67 percent. This situation will inevitably affect production safety and the improvement of workers' technical level.

The reason for the above-mentioned chaotic phenomena is mainly due to the one-sided views of leaders and grassroots management cadres at all levels of coal mines who emphasize output and neglect efficiency and cost, and lack the concept of economic accounting. They do not know that labor organization work is one of the fundamental problems in coal mine production. It is an important link in solving coal mine safety production, balanced production, and doing a good job in cost management. Due to insufficient understanding, many enterprises neglect labor organization work, do not have sound institutions for managing labor organization, lack dedicated personnel in charge, do not understand the on-site situation, and have no idea what is going on. They blindly increase personnel and arbitrarily allocate and transfer people when production tasks increase. Secondly, some enterprises pay more attention to labor organization work; however, they lack the correct policy. They simply regard reasonable labor organization as a simple measure to reduce some people, rather than achieving the purpose of rationally using labor and improving labor productivity by improving labor organization. Therefore, they cannot fundamentally solve the chaos of labor organization and overcome idleness and waste. In addition, the lack of sound systems and methods, such as the responsibility system, rotation system, attendance system, and quota management methods, is also the reason for the chaos of labor organization.

In order to improve the backward situation of labor organization in coal mine enterprises, improve the labor productivity of the coal mining industry, and reduce the cost of raw coal, the Ministry of Fuel Industry has listed the rectification of labor organization as one of the central tasks of the coal mining industry in 1954. The Coal Mine Management Bureau made a clear resolution at the Second National Labor and Wage Conference of Coal Mines. The general requirement is to vigorously rectify labor organization, overcome idleness and waste, reduce non-industrial personnel, streamline upper-level institutions, rectify auxiliary workshops, improve labor organization on mining and tunneling faces, improve attendance rate, fix workers, reduce turnover, ensure the needs of mining and tunneling labor, and gradually realize the planned management of labor organization—quota management.

At present, the rectification of labor organization in state-owned coal mine enterprises first involves fixing workers and fixing types of work. While not weakening the welfare undertakings urgently needed by employees, we must vigorously reduce non-production personnel. In auxiliary workshops, we must actively implement quota management, promote small-scale mechanization, improve equipment, implement part-time operations according to specific conditions, and implement contract systems for different regions, sections, and types of work, and correspondingly promote piece-rate and hourly bonus systems. On the one hand, mining and tunneling workers must ensure needs, and on the other hand, they must pay attention to improving on-site labor organization, and vigorously implement expert suggestions and charting systems. Streamline upper-level institutions and enrich the grassroots and the field. Gradually establish and implement a quota management system; according to the conditions on the ground, gradually formulate quota standards, and on this basis strengthen the balanced allocation of labor and incorporate labor allocation into the work plan. While rectifying labor organization, we must vigorously strengthen labor discipline education, do a good job in rotation systems and safety and health work, further consolidate labor discipline, and improve attendance rate.

Actively and cautiously, with a responsible attitude, gradually settling the old, weak, and disabled is one of the most complex and meticulous tasks in rectifying labor organization. At present, coal mines in various places are establishing review committees for the old, weak, and disabled, and deciding on settlement methods according to different situations. In terms of settlement methods, those who meet the conditions for labor insurance and old-age care must, in addition to the old technical workers who need to be retained by the enterprise, be mobilized to retire according to the provisions of the labor insurance regulations. The old, weak, and disabled who do not meet the old-age care regulations can be organized to exchange work or organize sideline production to settle within the enterprise as much as possible. In this regard, we must oppose the negative attitude of being timid and not actively carrying out work, and we must also oppose the irresponsible attitude of acting rashly and getting things done.

Strengthening the balance and scheduling of labor is also an important part of rectifying labor organization. At present, the first thing is to strengthen the control of labor. The Ministry of Fuel Industry has stipulated that no mine may increase personnel without the approval of the Coal Mine Management Bureau. To strengthen the balanced allocation of labor, first balance within the region, and then balance by the General Bureau. If it is found that it cannot be balanced, personnel can be added with the approval of the higher-level authority.

Facts have proved that rectifying labor organization is completely necessary to improve the current production situation of coal mines. According to the rectification of labor organization in some coal mines in the first half of the year, these enterprises have improved efficiency, reduced costs, and the completion of the state plan has improved. For example, after rectification, the 9264 coal extraction face of Kailuan Tangshan Mine extracted 18 percent of the original number of people, completed the output task, increased efficiency by 50 percent, and reduced the cost of raw coal ton wages by 32 percent. Later, it extracted 10 percent of the original number of people, and while improving efficiency, the daily output increased by 57.9 percent. Another example is that the No. 9 Well of Datong No. 3 Mine did not complete the planned efficiency in January and February, but after rectifying labor organization, it extracted 21 percent of the original number of people, and the efficiency completed 101.5 percent of the state plan, an increase of 7.24 percent compared with January and 6.46 percent compared with February, and the output completed 105.2 percent of the plan. After rectifying labor organization, the Datai Mine of Jingxi extracted 13 percent of the original personnel of the mine. In February, the output completed 141.02 percent of the state plan, the efficiency completed 148.65 percent, the tunneling footage completed 123 percent, and the cost was reduced by 10.34 percent compared with the plan, and the production situation greatly improved. Before rectifying labor organization, the Mechanical and Electrical Section of Fangshan Mine of the Bureau requested an increase of 20 people. After rectification, not only was there no increase in personnel, but 25 people were withdrawn to support capital construction.

The rectification of labor organization must be combined with improving the utilization rate of existing equipment and tools and carrying out small-scale mechanization campaigns. Facts have proved that some mining bureaus have improved technical management, continuously improved the technical level of employees, and promoted small-scale mechanization, which has not only reduced the physical labor of workers and improved labor conditions, but also reduced personnel and improved efficiency. While rectifying labor organization, it is also necessary to strengthen labor discipline education to ensure normal attendance in order to consolidate the rectification results. After the labor organization is rectified, the redundant people are transferred, and each worker assumes a fixed task that is closely related to and mutually restricted by the entire production. The absence of any one person may affect the progress of production. If we neglect labor discipline education and cannot guarantee normal attendance, it will inevitably lead to a shortage of personnel, and the results of the rectification will not be consolidated.

It must be pointed out that the work of rectifying labor organization has not been seriously carried out in many mining bureaus, and some leading cadres and grassroots cadres still have ideological resistance to this work. The phenomenon of increasing personnel without authorization in violation of regulations still exists. The most obvious fact is that coal mine personnel exceeded the planned target in the first half of this year. This situation should undoubtedly not exist for a long time. In the third quarter of this year, mining bureaus in various places should continue to vigorously rectify labor organization in conjunction with the central task, continuously improve labor productivity and reduce costs, and strive to comprehensively fulfill and over fulfill this year's state plan.

    整顿国营煤矿企业的劳动组织
    中央燃料工业部劳动工资处处长  杨毅
    劳动组织工作是企业管理的重要组成部分之一，它的任务是根据企业的生产特点，设备情况，以及生产程序和操作方法，合理的组织劳动力，把工人固定在一定的工作岗位上，进行互相密切联系的、秩序井然的有节奏的生产，使每个劳动者都明确自己的职责，发挥其生产积极性和工作责任心，不断的提高技术水平和改善操作方法，以保证企业劳动生产率的不断提高和成本的不断降低，以达到全面的完成或超额完成国家计划。
    由于煤矿工业生产条件的不断变化，劳动组织工作比较复杂和繁重。几年来，各地煤矿虽然进行了一些整顿工作，初步改善了采掘工作面的劳动组织，提高了采掘效率，但问题仍然很多。许多矿井的劳动组织工作长期无人负责，煤矿劳动组织中的种种混乱状况，已严重的阻碍着劳动生产率的提高和成本的不断降低，影响着国家计划的完成。
    目前国营煤矿劳动组织中比较突出的问题是：非工业人员的比重过于庞大，人员配备极不合理。一九五三年国营煤矿非工业人员平均占生产人员百分之三十二左右，个别单位占百分之五十以上，这就使得企业内部产生了许多人浮于事的现象。根据几个矿务局的调查，生产车间的窝工一般均在百分之十以上。如抚顺矿务局事务所机务段配备了百分之二十一的工人作为补勤，这些工人上班后有的无事可作，只好睡觉；龙凤矿杂工班有时有四十多人没活可干。更严重的是一方面窝工，另一方面却因人员不足而加班加点，给国家造成很大损失，仅抚顺事务所车务、机务两个段一九五三年即支出加班加点费十九亿多元，若在劳动组织上加以调整，这样巨大的损失是完全可以避免的。由于人员多，组织不合理，窝工浪费，就直接影响到劳动生产率的提高。一九五四年第一季度由于人员过多，配备不合理，致使不少矿务局虽然完成或超额完成了产量任务，而效率只完成计划的百分之六十九至九十五。由于煤矿企业管理机构庞大，层次重叠，人员配备不合理，技术干部多集中于上层机构，因而使得现场技术管理力量非常薄弱。
    煤矿劳动组织的不正常，还表现在企业劳动力大量的和经常的流动上面。一九五四年第一季度全国煤矿生产工人自行离职者占企业在册工人的百分之五（个别单位竟达百分之二十七以上），而自企业外部增加的新工人即占在册工人的百分之六点四（个别单位达百分之三十九）。更严重的是技术工人流动的比重大，如一九五三年抚顺局老虎台矿采掘工和机电工占流动工人的百分之五十三，这就严重的削弱了生产要害部门。煤矿中生产工人的内部流动也极为频繁，如阜新西八坑水沙充填工一个月内调出调入即达八十五次之多，被调动的人数，占全坑在籍工人的百分之三十六点五。由于技术工人的外流和新工人的大量增加，就造成现有工人中技术工人比重下降，新工人比重上升，如鹤岗一九五三年未满一年工龄的采掘工人占总采掘工人的百分之三十二，部分场子新工人竟达百分之六十七，这种状况势必影响生产上的安全和工人技术水平的提高。
    产生上述纷乱现象的原因，主要是由于煤矿各级领导和基层管理干部存在着重产量、轻效率、忽视成本的片面观点，缺乏经济核算思想。他们不知道劳动组织工作乃是煤矿生产中带有根本性质的问题之一，它是解决煤矿安全生产、均衡生产和搞好成本管理的重要环节。由于认识不足，因而许多企业忽视劳动组织工作，没有健全的管理劳动组织的机构，缺乏专人负责，对现场情况不摸底，心中无数，生产任务增加了就盲目增人，乱拨乱调。其次，有些企业虽较重视劳动组织工作；但缺乏正确的方针，他们把合理的劳动组织单纯的看作只是减少一些人的简单措施，而不是通过改善劳动组织，来达到合理使用劳动力，提高劳动生产率的目的，因而也就不能从根本上解决劳动组织的混乱，克服窝工浪费。此外，缺乏健全的制度和办法，如专责制，轮休制，考勤制，以及定员管理办法等，也是造成劳动组织混乱的原因。
    为了改善煤矿企业劳动组织上的落后状况，提高煤矿工业的劳动生产率，降低原煤成本，中央燃料工业部已将整顿劳动组织工作列为煤矿工业一九五四年中心工作之一，煤矿管理总局在全国煤矿第二届劳动工资会议上作了明确决议，总的要求是大力整顿劳动组织，克服窝工浪费，减少非工业人员，精简上层机构，整顿辅助车间，改善采掘工作面劳动组织，提高出勤率，固定工人，减少流动，保证采掘劳动力的需要，逐步实现劳动组织的计划管理——定员管理。
    目前国营煤矿企业整顿劳动组织，首先是进行固定工人，固定工种工作。在不削弱职工迫切需要的福利事业原则下，大力缩减非生产人员。在辅助车间是积极贯彻定员管理，推行小型机械化，改善设备，根据具体条件实行兼职作业，实行分区域分段分工种的包干制度，相应的推行计件制和计时奖励制。采掘工人一方面要保证需要，一方面必须注意改善现场的劳动组织，大力贯彻专家建议和图表制。精简上层机构，充实基层和现场。逐步建立和贯彻定员管理制度；根据现场条件，逐步制定定员标准，在此基础上加强劳动力的平衡调配，把劳动配备纳入作业计划。在整顿劳动组织的同时，大力加强劳动纪律教育，搞好轮休制度和安全卫生工作，进一步巩固劳动纪律，提高出勤率。
    积极主动的以慎重负责的态度，逐步安置老、弱、残人员，是整顿劳动组织中一项最复杂细致的工作。现在各地煤矿正在建立老、弱、残人员审查委员会，分别根据不同情况，决定安置办法。在安置的办法上，合乎劳动保险养老条件者，除企业需要留用的老技术工人外，必须按劳动保险条例规定，动员退职养老。不合乎养老条例之老、弱、残人员，可以组织换工或组织副业生产等办法，尽量在本企业内安置。在这方面，要反对怯于困难不积极进行工作的消极态度，也要反对轻率从事推出了事的不负责任的态度。
    加强劳动力的平衡与调度工作，也是整顿劳动组织工作中的一项重要内容。目前首先是加强劳动力的控制。燃料工业部已规定：不经煤矿管理总局批准，各矿不得擅自加人。加强劳动力的平衡调配，首先在地区平衡，然后由总局平衡，如果发现不能平衡时，经上级批准才能加人。
    事实证明：整顿劳动组织对于改善目前煤矿生产的状况是完全必要的，根据上半年一部分煤矿整顿劳动组织情况来看，这些企业都提高了效率，降低了成本，完成国家计划的情况均有好转。如开滦唐山矿九二六四回采工作面，整顿后抽出原有人数的百分之十八，完成了产量任务，效率提高了百分之五十，原煤吨工资成本降低百分之三十二，以后又抽出原有人数的百分之十，在提高效率的情况下，日产量提高百分之五十七点九。又如大同三矿九号井在整顿前，一、二月份均未完成计划效率，但在整顿劳动组织后，抽出原有人数的百分之二十一，效率完成国家计划百分之一百零一点五，比一月份提高百分之七点二四，比二月提高百分之六点四六，产量完成计划百分之一百零五点二。京西大台矿整顿劳动组织后，抽出该矿原有人员的百分之十三，二月份产量完成国家计划百分之一百四十一点零二，效率完成百分之一百四十八点六五，掘进进尺完成百分之一百二十三，成本较计划降低百分之十点三四，生产情况大为好转。在整顿劳动组织前，该局房山矿机电科要求增加二十人，经整顿后，不但没有增人，反而抽出了二十五人支援了基本建设。
    整顿劳动组织，必须与提高现有设备、工具的利用率及开展小型机械化运动相结合。事实证明，有些矿务局由于改进了技术管理，不断地提高了职工技术水平，推广了小型机械化，不仅减轻了工人的体力劳动，改善了劳动条件，同时也减少了人员，提高了效率。在整顿劳动组织的同时，还必须加强劳动纪律教育，保证正常出勤，以巩固整顿成果。劳动组织整顿后，多余的人调走了，每个工人都担负着与整个生产密切联系、互相制约的固定任务，缺少了任何一人都可能影响生产的进行。如果忽视劳动纪律教育，不能保证正常出勤，势必造成人员不足，整顿的成果就不能巩固。
    须要指出的是：整顿劳动组织工作目前在不少矿务局还没有认真的进行，有些领导干部和基层干部对这一工作在思想上还有抵触情绪。违反规定擅自增人的现象仍然存在。最明显的事实是：今年上半年煤矿人员又超出计划指标。这种状况无疑是不应当长期存在的。各地矿务局在今年第三季度应当结合中心工作，继续大力整顿劳动组织，不断提高劳动生产率和降低成本，争取全面的完成和超额完成今年的国家计划。
