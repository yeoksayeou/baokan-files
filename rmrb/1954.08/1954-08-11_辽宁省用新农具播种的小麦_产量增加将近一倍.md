Liaoning Province's Wheat Yield Nearly Doubles with New Agricultural Tools

This year, Liaoning Province has achieved a widespread bumper wheat harvest. The entire province's 140,000 hectares of wheat were harvested by the end of July. Preliminary statistics show an average yield of 600 kilograms per hectare. Liaoyang and Haicheng counties' nearly 40,000 hectares of wheat averaged 750 kilograms per hectare, an increase of 200 kilograms compared to last year. Agricultural producers' cooperatives using new agricultural tools saw even higher wheat yields. Across the province, the 7,000 hectares of wheat sown using new agricultural tools yielded approximately 85% to 100% more than ordinary wheat. In the suburbs of Shenyang, the 14 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Gaokan and Renjing villages that used new agricultural tools to sow over 100 hectares of wheat saw yields increase by 150% compared to last year. Currently, farmers are busily drying and threshing the wheat, actively preparing to sell the new wheat to the state.

    辽宁省用新农具播种的小麦
    产量增加将近一倍
    今年辽宁省小麦普遍获得丰收。全省十四万垧小麦在七月底已收割完毕，据初步统计平均每垧产麦一千二百斤。辽阳、海城两县近四万垧小麦平均每垧可产一千五百斤，比去年增产四百斤。农业生产合作社使用新式农具的小麦产量更高，全省使用新农具播种的七千垧小麦，比一般小麦增产百分之八十五到一倍左右。沈阳市郊区高坎、仁镜两村十四个农业生产合作社使用新式农具播种的一百多垧小麦产量，比去年增加一倍半。目前农民正在紧张晒打小麦，积极准备把新麦卖给国家。
