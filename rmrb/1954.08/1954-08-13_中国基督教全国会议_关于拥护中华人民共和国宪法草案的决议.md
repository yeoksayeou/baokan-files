    The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been promulgated. This Draft Constitution is the result of the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people for more than a century and was bought with the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs. This Draft Constitution reflects the fundamental requirements of the state during the transition period and the common aspirations of the broad masses of the people to build a socialist society. The people of the whole country are cheering for the promulgation of this Draft Constitution.
    The Draft Constitution will soon be adopted at the National People's Congress and become the fundamental law to be observed by all the people of the country. The Constitution is closely related to the life of every citizen. According to the Constitution, every citizen has the rights he should enjoy and the obligations he should fulfill. For us Christians, we especially cherish the right to freedom of religious belief, and we want to use this right to help us achieve better development in the work of the church and the lives of believers. We will never abuse this right as an excuse for any activities that violate the interests of the people. We will strive to eliminate the evil influences left to us by imperialism and the old society, and work with the people of the whole country to build a great socialist society. We must deeply understand the spirit of all the provisions of the Constitution and be patriotic and law-abiding citizens in our respective posts.
    It is an honor to be a Chinese citizen. The Draft Constitution makes us see more clearly the greatness and loveliness of the motherland and her bright and beautiful future. We should actively promote the Three-Self Patriotic Movement and support the first constitution of the People's Republic of China with practical actions.

    关于拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案的决议
    中华人民共和国宪法草案已经公布，这个宪法草案是中国人民一百多年来革命斗争的成果，是无数革命先烈的热血所换来的。这个宪法草案反映了国家在过渡时期的根本要求和广大人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望，全国人民都为这个宪法草案的公布而欢呼。
    宪法草案不久就要在全国人民代表大会会议上通过而成为全国人民共同遵守的根本大法，宪法和每个公民的生活都有着密切的关系。根据宪法，每个公民都有他所当享的权利，也有他所应尽的义务。对我们基督徒来说，我们特别珍贵宗教信仰自由的权利，我们要使这个权利帮助我们在教会的事业和信徒的生活上得到更美好的发展。我们决不滥用这个权利，作为任何违反人民利益的活动的借口。我们要努力肃清帝国主义和旧社会所遗留给我们的邪恶影响，与全国人民在一起，为建设伟大的社会主义社会而奋斗。我们必须深刻地体认宪法全部条文的精神，在各自的岗位上，做爱国守法的公民。
    作为一个中国人民是光荣的。宪法草案使我们更清楚地看见了祖国的伟大可爱和她光明美好的前途。我们应当积极推进三自爱国运动，以实际行动来拥护中华人民共和国第一个人民自己的宪法。
