Activities in Sichuan Province to Publicize the Draft Constitution

By the end of July, activities in Sichuan Province to publicize the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China had been widely and thoroughly carried out in 123 counties and cities, reaching the villages. In towns and cities above the county level throughout the province, the Draft Constitution has basically become a household name, and nationwide discussions have begun. In the Neijiang Special District, each village and town in the counties and cities has held one or two reports on the Draft Constitution. In the Fuling Special District, Nan Chuan, You Yang and other six counties alone have given more than 2,700 reports on the Draft Constitution to people from all walks of life. In the villages and towns of the Yibin Special District, 90% of adults directly heard reports on the Draft Constitution. In the cities, the publicity and discussion activities on the Draft Constitution have shifted from publicity and reports to seminars and discussions. Zigong City began to guide the people of the city to further discuss the Draft Constitution in depth from late July. Mianyang County decided that all reporters in the urban area should specifically guide the masses to conduct in-depth discussions on the Draft Constitution.

During the discussions on the Draft Constitution in various places, people spoke enthusiastically and universally, and put forward many supplementary and revision opinions. Some residents in Neijiang City even took out their treasured voter certificates during the discussion, stating that they are the masters of the country and should participate in the discussion of the fundamental law of the country. Eighty percent of citizens over the age of eighteen in the city participated in the discussion, and some people have discussed it more than ten times. The broad masses of women were extremely enthusiastic in the discussion. In order not to affect their participation in the discussion activities, women in Chengdu and Neijiang cities also organized temporary nurseries. In order to widely collect the opinions of the people on the Draft Constitution, Chengdu City set up 60 suggestion boxes in the city. As of the end of July, the Sichuan Provincial Draft Constitution Discussion Committee Office had received 744 supplementary and revision opinions on the Draft Constitution from people from all walks of life.

    四川省宣传宪法草案的活动
    已有一百二十三个县、市普遍深入到村
    到七月底，四川省宣传中华人民共和国宪法草案的活动，已有一百二十三个县、市普遍深入到村。全省县以上的城镇，对宪法草案已基本上家喻户晓，并已展开全民讨论。内江专区各县、市的每个村、镇都作了一次到两次关于宪法草案的报告。涪陵专区仅南川、酉阳等六个县就向各界人民作了二千七百多次关于宪法草案的报告。在宜宾专区的各个村、镇，直接听到关于宪法草案报告的人占成年人的百分之九十。在城市里，宪法草案的宣传讨论活动已从宣传和报告转入座谈和讨论。自贡市从七月下旬即开始引导全市人民进一步深入地讨论宪法草案。绵阳县城区决定要求全体报告员具体辅导群众对宪法草案进行深入的讨论。
    各地在讨论宪法草案时，人们发言踊跃、普遍，并提出了许多补充和修改意见。内江市有些居民在讨论中还拿出他们珍藏的选民证，表示他们是国家的主人，应该参加制定国家根本大法的讨论。全市年满十八岁以上的公民百分之八十参加了讨论，有的群众已讨论了十次以上。广大妇女群众在讨论中，政治热情极高。为了不影响自己参加讨论活动，成都市和内江市的妇女还组织了临时托儿站。为了广泛收集人民群众对宪法草案的意见，成都市在全市设立了六十个意见箱。截至七月底止，四川省宪法草案讨论委员会办公室已收到各界人民对宪法草案提出的补充和修改意见七百四十四条。
