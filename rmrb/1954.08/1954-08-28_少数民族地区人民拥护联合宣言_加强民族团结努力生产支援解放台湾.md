Xinhua News Agency reports: People in various ethnic minority areas are eagerly concerned about their compatriots of all ethnic groups in Taiwan who are living in dire straits. They have expressed their desire to further strengthen ethnic unity, work hard in production and work to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

    Ha Feng'a (Mongolian), Vice Chairman of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said: "The joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan fully conforms to the will of the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia. We will definitely work harder to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan."

    Zhao Cunxin (Dai), Chairman of the People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province, Dao Jingban (Dai), Chairman of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Region, Gong Shou (Dai), Vice Chairman, Lei Chunguo (Jingpo), etc., who were elected as deputies to the National People's Congress, represent the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas of Yunnan Province in firmly supporting the just struggle for the liberation of Taiwan. When they talked about the ethnic equality rights and the happy lives of unity and prosperity that the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas have obtained after liberation, they all expressed their deep concern and remembrance for their compatriots of all ethnic groups in Taiwan. Pu Zhao (Yi) said: "Taiwan is inhabited by our beloved Gaoshan and other fraternal ethnic groups. The people of our Honghe Hani Autonomous Region have suffered deeply from the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past, so we deeply know the great suffering of the Taiwanese compatriots. We must support the struggle to liberate Taiwan so that Taiwanese compatriots can return to the big family of the motherland as soon as possible." The joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan was transmitted to Zhiziluo on the west slope of Bilo Snow Mountain, where the representatives attending the first People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province unanimously expressed their firm support. Li Zhengcai (Nu), Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, Shuang Naidong (Lisu), Chairman of the Consultative Committee, A'nacai (Lisu), member of the People's Government, Gan Masilang, a Tibetan representative, and others all spoke about this. Shuang Naidong said: "When we are here joyfully celebrating our right to be masters of our own affairs, we miss our compatriots in Taiwan even more. The people of all ethnic groups in our Nujiang area are determined to unite firmly under the leadership of Chairman Mao, work hard in production, and fully support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan." Dao Guisheng, a model trade worker in Menghai, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, said: "Taiwan is Chinese territory, just like Xishuangbanna is Chinese territory!"

    Huang Xiang (Tibetan), Vice Chairman of the People's Government of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region in Gansu Province, said: "In the future, we must heighten our vigilance, strengthen ethnic unity, and actively develop animal husbandry production to support the struggle for the liberation of Taiwan." Atong Baike, Chairman of the Aksai Kazakh Autonomous Region People's Government on the border of Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces, said: "We will do everything in our power to help our Taiwanese compatriots liberate themselves from the abyss of suffering as soon as possible."

    Huang Xianfan (Zhuang), a professor in the History Department of Guangxi Normal College and a deputy to the National People's Congress, said: "Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times. Since the Sui and Tang dynasties, our people have worked hard to reclaim and develop Taiwan, and have created Taiwan into a beautiful island. Now, eight or ninety percent of the people in Taiwan have migrated from Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other provinces. This is an unquestionable fact. As a member of a minority ethnic group and an educator, I firmly support the joint declaration and am willing to do my part to liberate Taiwan."

    The members of the Qinghai Provincial Consultative Committee and the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government held a forum after hearing the joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan. They unanimously believed that the liberation of Taiwan is the common aspiration of the 600 million people of China for a long time. They expressed their determination to contribute their strength to the liberation of Taiwan and do their job well.
