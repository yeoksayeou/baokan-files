    The draft constitution solemnly declares in Article 1: "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." Fundamentally different from the state of exploiters, a people's democratic state is one where the people are the masters, and the power of our country belongs to the people. The ruling power of our country is held in the hands of the entire people, led by the working class.
    For the people to exercise the state's ruling power, they must adopt appropriate organizational forms to constitute their state organs. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On New Democracy": "As for the so-called 'political system' issue, it refers to the form of the power structure, the form in which certain social classes organize their power organs to oppose the enemy and protect themselves. Without an appropriate form of power organs, the state cannot be represented."
    The People's Congress system, built on the principle of democratic centralism, is the best basic organizational form of our people's democratic power.
    The draft constitution summarizes the experience of our people in long-term revolutionary struggles and in organizing state power over the past five years, elevates and develops it, and draws on the experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to fix our country's basic political system – the People's Congress system – in legal form.
    Our People's Congress system and the Soviet Union's Soviet system belong to the same socialist type of political organizational form. They are essentially consistent because they are both genuine people's representative organs and are built according to the principle of democratic centralism. Only due to specific circumstances do our People's Congress system and the Soviet system have some differences in form.
    However, our People's Congress system is completely different from the parliamentary system of bourgeois countries. They are fundamentally opposed in terms of class essence and organizational principles.
    Compared with the parliamentary system of bourgeois countries, our People's Congress system has great superiority. The superiority of the People's Congress system is mainly manifested in the following aspects:
    First, our People's Congress system is most conducive to the broad masses of the people participating in the management and construction of the country, and is most conducive to giving play to the wisdom, initiative, and creativity of the people.
    Article 2 of the draft constitution stipulates: "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels." The Chinese people exercise their own state power by electing people's representatives to form people's congresses at all levels. The implementation of a People's Congress system with universal suffrage can guarantee the further democratization of our country and enable all working people who have never had political rights in the old society to participate in the management and construction of the country in the position of masters.
      Our democratic election system and a completely free election environment ensure that the People's Congress can become a people's representative organ that truly represents the will of the people. Article 86 of the draft constitution stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of nationality, race, sex, occupation, social origin, religious belief, education level, property status, or length of residence, have the right to vote and to stand for election." Only a very small number of mentally ill people and those who have been deprived of their right to vote and to stand for election by law are excluded. The recently successfully completed national grassroots elections show that the registered voters in the electoral areas accounted for 97.18 percent of the total population aged 18 and above in the electoral areas. The number of people deprived of their electoral rights by law plus mentally ill patients accounts for only 2.82 percent of the total population aged 18 and above in the electoral areas. This fully demonstrates the universality and equality of our election system and proves that our people's democratic state has a very broad mass base.
    The implementation of our democratic election system has greatly promoted the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people to participate in political life. The broad masses of voters cherish their democratic election rights and enthusiastically participate in the elections. In the electoral areas across the country, the number of voters who participated in the voting accounted for 85.88 percent of the total number of registered voters. In many areas, it was as high as 90 percent or more, and in some areas, it even reached 100 percent.
    Our democratic elections are conducted in a completely free environment that ensures voters are not subject to any pressure. A genuine democratic election system and a completely free election environment guarantee that the broad masses of the people can freely elect the candidates they deem satisfactory and necessary to the representative organs according to their own will. For example, in this grassroots election, many outstanding individuals from the industrial and agricultural production fronts and other fields were elected as people's representatives.
    In this grassroots election, a total of 5,669,144 representatives of grassroots people's congresses were elected nationwide, which fully demonstrates the enormous scope of people's participation in state management in our country. The actual and large-scale participation of the broad masses of the people in state management can unleash the infinite wisdom and creativity of the broad masses of the people and greatly promote the political and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people.
    It can be seen that our People's Congress is an organ that fully represents the will of the people. Therefore, the implementation of the People's Congress system can guarantee that all power in our country belongs to the people.
    In contrast to our People's Congress system, the parliament of bourgeois countries is not a representative organ of the people but only a representative organ of the exploiters. The parliament of bourgeois countries "is an instrument of the bourgeoisie to oppress the proletariat, the organ of the enemy class, that is, a minority of exploiters" (Lenin: "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky").
    The reactionary rulers of the bourgeoisie try their best to keep the door to participation in state management tightly closed to the working people. Bourgeois countries nominally tout "universal suffrage" but in practice use age, sex, property quantity, length of residence, education level, occupation, religious belief, and nationality and race to deprive the broad masses of working people of their right to vote. For example, in the United States, there are more than fifty kinds of such restrictions, even according to official U.S. materials. In the 1948 election in the United States, 20 million qualified voters were unreasonably deprived of their right to vote; in the 1952 election, the Associated Press estimated that 25 million citizens would be deprived of their right to vote, accounting for a quarter of the number of people who reached voting age. To this day, there are still more than 30 countries in the capitalist world where women do not have the right to vote. Therefore, the so-called "universal suffrage" in bourgeois countries is completely a deception to the people.
    It must also be pointed out that elections in bourgeois countries are conducted under the brutal suppression, threats, and bribery of voters by reactionary rulers. Such an undemocratic election system and an unfree election environment determine that elections cannot truly express the will of the voters but only end with a minority of exploiters monopolizing the majority or even all of the seats in parliament.
    Second, our People's Congress is built on the principle of national equality, which guarantees the equal rights of people of all minority nationalities in the country to participate in state management.
    Our country is a unified multi-ethnic country. National equality is one of the basic principles of our draft constitution. This principle is also reflected in the People's Congress system.
    The principle of national equality embodied in the People's Congress system is first reflected in our country's implementation of a truly universal and equal democratic election system regardless of nationality or race.
    The principle of national equality is also reflected in the provisions on the number of representatives to the People's Congress. Our election law pays special attention to the various minority nationalities in the country and makes special provisions for the elections of the various minority nationalities, so that the various minority nationalities can have representatives in the people's congresses at all levels that are commensurate with their status. According to the provisions of the election law, the number of representatives of minority nationalities, which account for about one-fifteenth of the total population of the country, attending the National People's Congress is expected to be close to one-seventh of the total number of representatives. The election law also gives appropriate consideration to the number of minority nationality representatives to the local people's congresses at all levels.
    In order to guarantee that the people of minority nationalities can exercise their right to be masters of their own affairs the draft constitution stipulates that regional autonomy shall be practiced in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated settlements. The organs of self-government of the various national autonomous areas exercise the power of autonomy within the limits prescribed by the Constitution and the law. The draft constitution also stipulates that in the organs of self-government of national autonomous areas where many nationalities live together, each relevant nationality shall have an appropriate number of representatives. All of this ensures that our People's Congress can become a people's representative organ representing the will of the people of all nationalities, and ensures that our state organs can closely unite the people of all nationalities around themselves, forming a unified and indestructible force.
    In contrast to our People's Congress system, the parliamentary system of bourgeois countries is based on national inequality and national oppression.
    The constitutions of bourgeois countries directly or indirectly restrict or completely deprive the people of minority nationalities of the possibility of participating in state management. For example, the U.S. Constitution openly declares the deprivation of the right to vote of local Indians; the U.S. "election tax," "head tax," and other various restrictions often deprive the broad masses of black people of their right to vote. According to the 1942 materials, only 10 percent of black people in the United States who were 21 years of age or older were listed on the voter registration list, and only 1 percent participated in the voting. Black people in the United States account for about one-tenth of the total population, but in the 531 members of the two houses of the 81st Congress, there were only two black people.
    Third, our People's Congress system can realize the unity of people's power. In our country, the people's power is uniformly exercised by the People's Congress.
    Our National People's Congress is a genuine supreme state power organ, and it is the fully empowered representative of the people's will. The draft constitution stipulates that the National People's Congress shall be the sole organ exercising the state's legislative power; the National People's Congress shall have the power to decide on all major issues in our country's life; all other state organs, including the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, the State Council, the President of the Supreme People's Court, and the Procurator-General, shall be produced by the National People's Congress and subject to its supervision, and may also be dismissed by it; in addition, the National People's Congress may exercise all other functions and powers that it deems should be exercised by it. In short, our National People's Congress holds the supreme and complete state power, and no state organ can transcend the National People's Congress or exercise state power in violation of the will of the National People's Congress. Our government (the State Council) is the executive organ of the National People's Congress, and it is responsible to the National People's Congress and reports its work to it. These provisions ensure that the National People's Congress can exercise genuine supervision over the government. Our National People's Congress not only has independent legislative power but also directly controls executive power. It can be seen that our National People's Congress realizes the unity of legislative power and executive power, and our National People's Congress is "a working group that simultaneously serves as a legislative and executive body" (Marx).
    Our local people's congresses at all levels are the local state power organs at all levels, and they have the power to decide on various major issues in their respective regions, the power to elect and dismiss the members of the people's committees at their respective levels and the presidents of the people's courts at their respective levels, and the power to change or revoke the inappropriate resolutions and orders of the people's committees at their respective levels. Therefore, the people's congresses at all levels are not only deliberative organs but also working organs with real power. As for the local people's committees at all levels, they are the executive organs of the local people's congresses at all levels, and they are all local state administrative organs, not organs that are opposed to the local people's congresses at all levels.
    The fully empowered status of the People's Congress guarantees that all power in our country is concentrated in the hands of the people, and guarantees that the people of the whole country can truly be masters of their own affairs in the life of the country because our People's Congresses are all elected by the people through universal suffrage in a completely free election environment.
    Our people's representatives remain workers in various construction posts in the country after being elected. Therefore, our people's representatives can not only discuss and decide on major state affairs but also participate in the implementation of the resolutions of the representative organs to ensure the realization of the people's will. People's representatives can execute the resolutions of the representative organs with exemplary leading actions in their own work posts, so that all resolutions of the representative organs can be transformed into the actual actions of the broad masses of the people.
    In contrast to our People's Congress system, the parliament of bourgeois countries is not a genuine people's representative organ or the supreme state power organ but only a talking shop for the bourgeoisie to fool the people. In bourgeois countries, legislative power and executive power are separated. The parliament of bourgeois countries has only formal legislative power, and executive power can be completely separated from the parliament and independent. The government of bourgeois countries is opposed to the parliament, and the parliament has no real power to supervise the government. Especially in the imperialist period, due to the strengthening of executive power, the parliament of bourgeois countries has degenerated into a talking shop "merely engaged in empty talk to fool the 'common people'" (Lenin). In modern bourgeois countries, the real state work is not carried out in the parliament but behind the scenes—in the presidential palace and the cabinet, in large companies and large banks. In fact, it is not the people or the parliament but the monopoly capital groups that directly control the state power of bourgeois countries.
    Fourth, our People's Congress system eliminates the long-standing opposition between the central and local governments in bourgeois countries, and it can unify all local governments in our country into a strong whole. Our People's Congress system, on the one hand, guarantees the unified, centralized, and planned leadership of the central government, and on the other hand, can give full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the local governments.
    To build our country into a great socialist country, to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, to suppress all enemies of the people, and to resist and prevent foreign aggression, we must concentrate the strength of the whole country and form a strong unity under the centralized leadership of the central government. In our country, the unified and centralized leadership of the central government is closely combined with giving full play to the initiative and creativity of the work of each local government in accordance with local conditions. Our People's Congress system also guarantees that the tasks of the whole country can be combined with the diverse local conditions, so that each local government can fully play its local initiative and creativity in completing national tasks and plans in accordance with local specific conditions.
    The principle of the lower level being subordinate to the higher level and the local government being subordinate to the central government, as stipulated in the draft constitution, as well as the provisions on the functions and powers of the local people's congresses at all levels and the local people's committees at all levels, guarantee the political unity of the people of the whole country, and at the same time guarantee that the local governments can play their initiative and enthusiasm in executing national tasks and plans.
    In contrast to our People's Congress system, the parliamentary system of bourgeois countries implements the principle of bureaucratic centralism. Bourgeois countries deprive local organs of the function of exercising state power. The local state power of bourgeois countries is almost entirely manipulated by bureaucrats appointed by the central government. The officials dispatched by the central organs of bourgeois countries stand above the local "autonomous" organs, and they actually deprive the formally elected local "autonomous" organs of any independence. Because the bourgeoisie fears the influence of the masses of the people on the local "autonomous" organs, the bourgeoisie tries its best to concentrate state power in the hands of bureaucrats who are not responsible to the people or to the representative organs.
    Fifth, our People's Congress system guarantees that our state organs maintain close ties with the masses of the people and are subject to the constant supervision of the masses of the people.
    Our people's representatives are not high-ranking officials who rule the people but faithful servants of the people. Our voters can replace representatives who violate their promises or who do not act according to the will of the people at any time. Articles 38 and 61 of the draft constitution stipulate that the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels shall be subject to the supervision of the original electoral units and voters, and the original electoral units and voters shall have the right to replace the representatives they elected at any time in accordance with the procedures prescribed by law. This provision guarantees that each representative must honestly act in accordance with the will of the people and cannot violate the interests of the people in the slightest. The representative responsibility system further embodies the truly master status of the people of the whole country in the life of the country.
    The draft constitution also stipulates that all state organs must rely on the masses of the people, maintain close ties with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and accept the supervision of the masses; all state organ personnel must be loyal to the people's democratic system, abide by the constitution and the law, and strive to serve the people; citizens have the right to lodge written or oral complaints with state organs at all levels against any state organ personnel who violate the law or neglect their duties, and so on. These provisions guarantee that our state organs can constantly eliminate the corrupt habits of bureaucracy and become state organs that serve the people with a high degree of work efficiency.
    In contrast to our People's Congress system, the parliament of bourgeois countries is not responsible to the people. When running for election, the members of parliament of bourgeois countries try to please the voters and make a lot of promises of various kinds to win votes. But once they are elected, they can arbitrarily break their promises and even engage in all kinds of anti-people criminal activities because in bourgeois countries, voters do not have the right to supervise and replace representatives. It is precisely because such an anti-democratic system exists in bourgeois countries that it facilitates monopoly capitalists to buy representatives and manipulate parliament. Therefore, the representatives of bourgeois countries are not really "independent," and they are responsible to the monopoly capital groups.
    As for the bureaucrats of the government organs of bourgeois countries, they are not only not responsible to the people but also not responsible to the representative organs of the bourgeoisie. The bureaucrats of bourgeois countries are completely detached from the masses of the people and stand high above the masses of the people, and they directly implement bloody suppression against the masses of the people.
    In short, our People's Congress system and the parliamentary system of bourgeois countries are completely opposed, and our People's Congress system has unparalleled superiority and infinite vitality. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing: "The state system of the people's representative conference and the people's congress of the new democracy has proved and will prove in future history that it is incomparably superior to any old democratic parliamentary system, and it is ten thousand times more democratic to the people than the old democratic parliamentary system."
    The fundamental reason why our People's Congress system has unparalleled superiority lies in the fact that our country is a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and a country where the people hold the power of rule; while bourgeois countries are countries of the bourgeois dictatorship, and countries where a minority of exploiters rule and exploit the broad masses of working people.
    The superiority of our country's state system determines the superiority of our country's political system, which is adapted to the state system. The political system of our country is the People's Congress system established according to the principle of democratic centralism. Chairman Mao once summarized the basic principles of the People's Congress system in "On New Democracy" to one point, saying: "This system is democratic centralism." In "On Coalition Government," Chairman Mao pointed out the spiritual essence of democratic centralism: "It is democratic and centralized. That is to say, centralization on the basis of democracy, and democracy under the guidance of centralization."
    The superiority of democratic centralism embodied in the People's Congress system is mainly manifested in the following two aspects:
    First, democratic centralism guarantees the master status of the people of the whole country in the life of the country and guarantees that all power in our country is in the hands of the people. According to the principle of democratic centralism, the representatives of the people's congresses at all levels are produced by the people through universal suffrage, and the people's representatives must accept the constant supervision of the original electoral units or voters. This shows that all the power held by the People's Congress comes directly from the people. In addition, all our state organs and their personnel must also accept the supervision of the masses of the people, which also shows that our country is a truly people's democratic country, and the people are the real masters of our country. Therefore, the implementation of the principle of democratic centralism can extensively absorb the broad masses of the people to participate in the management and construction of the country, and can give full play to the political and labor enthusiasm of the masses of the people.
    Second, democratic centralism also guarantees a high degree of concentration of people's power and embodies the solid unity of people's power. Our National People's Congress holds the supreme state power, and it can decide on all major events in our country; our local people's congresses at all levels are also the local state power organs; the administrative organs, courts, and procuratorial organs of our country are all produced by the state power organs, and they must be responsible to the state power organs and report their work to them, and they must be subject to the supervision of the state power organs. All of this shows that our People's Congress is the most powerful organization in our country and the fully empowered representative of the people's will. The high concentration of power of the People's Congress can realize the unity of people's power, can unify all local governments in the country into a strong and powerful whole, so that our country can exert its powerful strength to victoriously solve the many arduous and complex tasks facing our country in the transition period.
    Bourgeois countries do not implement democratic centralism but bureaucratic centralism. In bourgeois countries, there is no democratic basis, and therefore, the actual power of bourgeois countries is concentrated in the hands of bureaucratic organs that are not responsible to the representative organs and the people, and the bureaucratic organs directly implement violent suppression against the masses of the people.
    In short, the state organs established according to our People's Congress system of democratic centralism are the organs of the people themselves, and they maintain close ties with the people. Therefore, our state organs also have infinite power and can defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, defend the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty; can suppress all treasonous and counter-revolutionary activities, protect the safety and rights of all citizens; can lead our country's socialist construction cause, and guarantee that our country will eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society.

    人民代表大会制度的优越性
    吴家麟
    宪法草案第一条庄严地宣布：“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。”和剥削者国家根本相反，人民民主国家是人民当家作主的国家，我们国家的一切权力是属于人民的，我们国家的统治权力是掌握在以工人阶级为领导的全国人民的手里的。
    人民要行使国家的统治权力，就必须采取适当的组织形式来组成自己的国家机关。毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中说：“至于还有所谓‘政体’问题，那是指的政权构成的形式问题，指的一定的社会阶级取何种形式去组织那反对敌人保护自己的政权机关。没有适当形式的政权机关，就不能代表国家。”
    建立在民主集中制原则上的人民代表大会制度，就是我们人民民主政权的最好的基本的组织形式。
    宪法草案总结了我国人民在长期革命斗争及近五年来组织国家权力的经验，加以提高和发展，并参考苏联和其他各人民民主国家的经验，把我们国家的基本政治制度——人民代表大会制度，用法律形式固定下来了。
    我们的人民代表大会制度，和苏联的苏维埃制度同属于社会主义类型的政治组织形式，二者在实质上是一致的，因为它们都是真正的人民代表机关，都是按照民主集中制原则建立起来的；只是由于具体情况不同，我们的人民代表大会制度和苏维埃制度在形式上还有一些差别。
    但是，我们的人民代表大会制度，和资产阶级国家的议会制度则完全不同，它们无论在阶级本质上或者在组织原则上都是根本对立的。
    和资产阶级国家的议会制度比较起来，我们的人民代表大会制度具有极大的优越性。人民代表大会制度的优越性，主要表现在以下几个方面：
    第一、我们的人民代表大会制度最便利于广大人民群众参加国家的管理和建设事业，最便利于发挥人民群众的智慧、积极性和创造性。
    宪法草案第二条规定：“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。”中国人民就是通过选举人民代表，组成各级人民代表大会，来行使属于人民自己的国家权力的。实行普选的人民代表大会制度，就可以保证我们国家的进一步民主化，就会使得一切在旧社会中从来没有政治权利的劳动群众，都能够以主人翁的地位来参加国家的管理和建设事业。
      我们的民主选举制度和完全自由的选举环境，保证了人民代表大会能够成为真正代表人民意志的人民代表机关。宪法草案第八十六条规定：“中华人民共和国年满十八岁的公民，不分民族、种族、性别、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰、教育程度、财产状况、居住期限，都有选举权和被选举权。”只有极少数的精神病患者和依法被剥夺选举权和被选举权的人除外。最近刚刚胜利完成的全国基层选举，在选举地区所登记的选民，占进行选举地区十八周岁以上人口总数的百分之九十七点一八。而全国依法被剥夺选举权利的人并加上精神病患者，只占进行选举地区十八周岁以上人口总数的百分之二点八二。这就充分说明了我们选举制度的普遍性和平等性，也证明了我们人民民主国家具有极为广泛的群众基础。
    我们的民主选举制度的实行，大大促进了广大人民参加政治生活的积极性，广大选民都十分珍贵自己的民主选举权利，热烈地参加了选举。全国进行选举地区的选民，参加投票的占登记的选民总数的百分之八十五点八八，很多地区高达百分之九十以上，有不少地区甚至达到百分之百。
    我们的民主选举，是在保证选民不受任何压力的完全自由的环境之下进行的。真正的民主选举制度和完全自由的选举环境，就保证了广大人民都能自由地按照自己的意志，把自己认为满意和必要的人选到代表机关中去。例如在这次基层选举中，很多工业和农业生产战线上以及其他各方面的优秀人物被选为人民代表。
    在这次基层选举中，全国各地共选出五百六十六万九千一百四十四名基层人民代表大会的代表，这充分地说明了我国人民参加国家管理规范的巨大。广大人民实际上和大量地参加国家管理，就可以把广大人民群众无穷无尽的智慧和创造能力发挥出来，就可以大大地促进广大人民群众的政治积极性和劳动积极性。
    由此可见，我们的人民代表大会是充分地代表人民意志的机关。所以实行人民代表大会制度能够保证我们国家的一切权力属于人民。
    和我们的人民代表大会制度相反，资产阶级国家的议会并不是人民的代表机关，而只是剥削者的代表机关。资产阶级国家的议会“是资产阶级压迫无产阶级的工具，是敌人阶级即少数剥削者底机关”（列宁：“无产阶级革命与叛徒考茨基”）。
    资产阶级的反动统治者千方百计地把参加国家管理的大门对劳动人民紧紧地关闭起来。资产阶级国家在形式上标榜着什么“普遍选举权”，而在实际上却用年龄、性别、财产数量、居住期限、教育程度、职业、宗教信仰以及民族、种族等资格限制，来剥夺广大劳动人民的选举权利。例如在美国，诸如此类的限制，即使根据美国官方公布的材料来看，也有五十余种之多。美国一九四八年的选举中，有二千万合格的选民被无理地剥夺了选举权利；在一九五二年的选举中，据美联社估计，要有二千五百万个公民被剥夺选举权，这个数目占达到选举年龄人数的四分之一。直到现在为止，在资本主义世界中，仍有三十多个国家的妇女没有选举权。因此，资产阶级国家所谓“普遍选举权”，完全是欺骗人民的幌子。
    还必须指出，资产阶级国家的选举都是在反动统治者对选民的野蛮压制和威胁利诱的情况下进行的。像这样的不民主的选举制度和不自由的选举环境，就决定了选举不可能真正表达选民的意志，而只是以剥削者少数垄断议会大多数甚至全部席位来收场的。
    第二、我们的人民代表大会是建立在民族平等的原则上的，它保障了国内各少数民族人民参加国家管理的平等权利。
    我国是一个统一的多民族的大国。民族平等是我国宪法草案的基本原则之一。这个原则同样地也反映在人民代表大会制度上面。
    人民代表大会制度所体现的民族平等的原则，首先表现在我们国家实行不分民族和种族的真正普遍平等的民主选举制度上。
    民族平等的原则也表现在人民代表大会代表名额的规定上。我们的选举法特别照顾到国内各少数民族，对于各少数民族的选举，做了专章的规定，使各少数民族在各级人民代表大会中都能够有和其地位相适应的代表。根据选举法的规定，占全国人口总数约十五分之一的少数民族，出席全国人民代表大会的代表名额预计将会接近代表总数的七分之一。对于地方各级人民代表大会的少数民族代表名额，选举法也都给予适当的照顾。
    为了保障少数民族人民能够行使当家作主的权利，宪法草案规定，在各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治。各民族自治机关按照宪法和法律规定的权限行使自治权。宪法草案还规定，在多民族杂居的民族自治地方的自治机关中，各有关民族都应当有适当名额的代表。所有这些，都保证了我们的人民代表大会能够成为代表各民族人民意志的人民代表机关，并保证我们的国家机关能够把各民族人民紧密地团结在自己的周围，形成为统一的不可摧毁的力量。
    和我们的人民代表大会制度相反，资产阶级国家的议会制则是以民族不平等和民族压迫为基础的。
    资产阶级国家的宪法直接或间接地限制着或者根本剥夺了少数民族人民参加国家管理的可能。例如，美国的宪法公开宣布剥夺当地印第安人的选举权；美国的“选举税”、“人头税”以及其他各种各样的限制，经常剥夺了广大黑人的选举权利。根据一九四二年的材料，美国年满二十一岁的黑人仅有百分之十列入选民名册，而参加投票的仅有百分之一。美国黑人约占人口总数的十分之一，而在八十一届国会两院的五百三十一名议员中，只有两个是黑人。
    第三、我们的人民代表大会制度能够实现人民权力的统一。在我国，人民的权力是统一由人民代表大会来行使的。
    我们的全国人民代表大会是真正的最高国家权力机关，它是人民意志的全权代表者。宪法草案规定：全国人民代表大会是行使国家立法权的唯一机关；全国人民代表大会有权决定我们国家生活中的一切重大问题；一切其他的国家机关，包括中华人民共和国主席、国务院、最高人民法院院长和总检察长，都由全国人民代表大会产生并受它监督，也可以由它罢免；此外，全国人民代表大会还可以行使一切它所认为应当由它行使的其他职权。总之，我们的全国人民代表大会握有至高无上的全部国家权力，没有任何国家机关可以超越全国人民代表大会或违反全国人民代表大会的意志而行使国家权力。我们的政府（国务院）是全国人民代表大会的执行机关，它要对全国人民代表大会负责并报告工作。这些规定保证了全国人民代表大会对政府能够行使真正的监督。我们的全国人民代表大会不仅本身具有独立的立法权，而且直接控制着行政权。由此可见，我们的全国人民代表大会实现了立法权和行政权的统一，我们的全国人民代表大会是“同时兼任立法和行政的工作团体”（马克思）。
    我们的地方各级人民代表大会是各级地方国家权力机关，它们有权决定本地区的各种重大问题，有权选举和罢免本级人民委员会的组成人员和本级人民法院院长，有权改变或者撤销本级人民委员会的不适当的决议和命令。因此，各级人民代表大会不仅是议事的机关，而且是真正有权力的工作机关。至于地方各级人民委员会则是地方各级人民代表大会的执行机关，都是地方国家行政机关，而不是和地方各级人民代表大会对立的机关。
    人民代表大会的全权地位，保证了我们国家的
  一切权力都集中在人民手里，保证了全国人民在国家生活中真正能够当家作主，因为我们的人民代表大会都是由人民用普选方式在完全自由的选举环境下选举产生的。
    我们的人民代表在当选以后，仍然是国家各种建设岗位上的工作者。因此，我们的人民代表不但能够讨论和决定国家大事，而且能够实际参与代表机关决议的执行，以保证人民意志的实现。人民代表可以在自己的工作岗位上以模范带头行动执行代表机关的决议，使代表机关的一切决议都能够变成广大人民群众的实际行动。
    和我们的人民代表大会制度相反，资产阶级国家的议会不是真正的人民代表机关，不是最高国家权力机关，而只是资产阶级愚弄人民的清谈馆。在资产阶级国家里，立法权和行政权是分立的。资产阶级国家的议会只有形式上的立法权，行政权可以完全脱离议会而独立。资产阶级国家的政府是和议会相对立的，议会在实际上没有监督政府的权力。尤其是在帝国主义时期，由于行政权力的加强，资产阶级国家的议会已经堕落到“仅仅专为愚弄‘老百姓’而从事空谈”（列宁）的清谈馆的地位。在现代资产阶级国家里，真正的国家工作并不在议会中进行，而是在幕后——在总统府和内阁里，在大公司和大银行里进行的。事实上，直接掌握资产阶级国家大权的不是人民，也不是议会，而是垄断资本集团。
    第四、我们的人民代表大会制度，消除了资产阶级国家中长期存在的中央和地方之间的对立，它能够把我们全国一切地方统一成为一个坚强的整体。我们的人民代表大会制度，一方面保证了中央统一集中的有计划的领导，另一方面又能够充分发挥地方的主动性和积极性。
    要把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家，要巩固人民民主专政，镇压一切人民的敌人，并且抵抗和防止外来的侵略，就一定要集中全国的力量，使全国在中央集中领导下形成坚强的统一。在我们国家里，中央的统一集中的领导和充分发挥各个地方的因地制宜的工作主动性和创造性是密切结合着的。我们的人民代表大会制度也保证了全国任务能够和多种多样的地方条件相结合，使各地方在完成国家任务和计划时能够根据当地具体条件，充分地发挥地方的积极性和创造性。
    宪法草案所规定的下级服从上级、地方服从中央的原则，以及对地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会职权的规定，保证了全国人民在政治上的统一，同时也保证了地方在执行国家任务和计划时能够发挥主动性和积极性。
    和我们的人民代表大会制度相反，资产阶级国家的议会制所实行的是官僚主义的中央集权制的原则。资产阶级国家剥夺了地方机关行使国家权力的职能。资产阶级国家的地方国家权力差不多都是由中央所任命的官僚来操纵的。资产阶级国家的中央机关所委派的官吏们站在地方“自治”机关之上，他们实际上剥夺了在形式上由选举产生的地方“自治”机关的任何独立性。由于资产阶级惧怕人民群众对地方“自治”机关的影响，资产阶级极力使国家权力集中在对人民、对代表机关不负责任的官僚手中。
    第五、我们的人民代表大会制度保证了我们的国家机关经常和人民群众保持着密切的联系，并受人民群众的经常监督。
    我们的人民代表并不是高高在上统治人民的老爷，而是人民的忠实勤务员。我们的选民对于违背自己的诺言的代表，对于不依照人民的意志行事的代表，可以随时把他撤换。宪法草案第三十八条和第六十一条规定，全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会都要受原选举单位和选民的监督，原选举单位和选民有权按照法律规定的程序随时撤换自己选出的代表。这种规定，保证每个代表都必须老老实实地依照人民的意志办事，不能丝毫违反人民的利益。代表负责制进一步体现了全国人民在国家生活中真正的主人翁地位。
    宪法草案还规定：一切国家机关必须依靠人民群众，经常保持同群众的密切联系，倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督；一切国家机关工作人员必须效忠人民民主制度，服从宪法和法律，努力为人民服务；公民对于任何违法失职的国家机关工作人员，有向各级国家机关提出书面控诉或口头控诉的权利，等等。这些规定，保证我们的国家机关能够不断地清除官僚主义的腐朽习气，成为具有高度工作效率的为人民服务的国家机关。
    和我们的人民代表大会制度相反，资产阶级国家的议会却是不对人民负责的。资产阶级国家的议员在竞选的时候，向选民阿谀逢迎，许出一大堆各种各样的诺言，以骗取选票。但是当他们一旦当选，他们就可以任意背弃自己的诺言，甚至可以干各种反人民的罪恶勾当，因为在资产阶级国家里，选民是没有监督和撤换代表的权利的。正是因为资产阶级国家中存在着这样反民主的制度，却便利于垄断资本家收买代表和操纵议会。因此，资产阶级国家的代表实际上也并不是真正“独立”的，他们是对垄断资本集团负责的。
    至于资产阶级国家政府机关的官僚们，则不但不向人民负责，而且也不向资产阶级代表机关负责。资产阶级国家的官僚是完全脱离人民群众的，是高高地站在人民群众之上的，他们直接对人民群众实行血腥的镇压。
    总之，我们的人民代表大会制度和资产阶级国家的议会制度是完全对立的，我们的人民代表大会制度具有无比的优越性和无穷的生命力。正如刘少奇同志在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话中所指出的：“新民主主义的人民代表会议与代表大会的国家制度，已经证明，在将来的历史上还会要证明它是比任何旧民主主义的议会制度要无比优越的，对人民来讲，它比旧民主主义的议会制度要更加民主一万倍。”
    我们的人民代表大会制度之所以具有无比的优越性，其根本原因乃在于：我们的国家是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，是人民掌握统治权力的国家；而资产阶级国家则是资产阶级专政的国家，是少数剥削者统治并剥削广大劳动人民的国家。
    我国国体的优越性，就决定了和国体相适应的我国政体的优越性。我们国家的政体是根据民主集中制的原则建立起来的人民代表大会制度。毛主席在“新民主主义论”中，曾经把人民代表大会制度的基本原则归纳到一点，说：“这种制度即是民主集中制。”在“论联合政府”中，毛主席指出民主集中制的精神实质：“它是民主的，又是集中的。就是说，在民主基础上的集中，在集中指导下的民主。”
    在人民代表大会制度中所体现的民主集中制的优越性，主要表现在以下两个方面：
    首先，民主集中制保证了全国人民在国家生活中的主人翁地位，保证了我们国家的一切权力都掌握在人民的手里。根据民主集中制的原则，各级人民代表大会的代表，由人民用普选方式产生，人民代表必须接受原选举单位或选民的经常监督。这说明人民代表大会所握有的一切权力，都是直接来自人民的。此外，我们一切国家机关及其工作人员也必须接受人民群众的监督，这也表明我们的国家是真正的人民民主国家，人民是我们国家的真正主人。因此，民主集中制原则的实行，就能够广泛地吸收广大人民群众参加国家管理和建设事业，能够充分地发挥人民群众的政治积极性和劳动积极性。
    其次，民主集中制也保证了人民权力高度的集中，体现了人民权力坚固的统一。我们的全国人民代表大会握有至高无上的国家权力，它可以决定我们国家的一切大事；我们的地方各级人民代表大会也都是地方的国家权力机关；我们国家的行政机关、法院以及检察机关都是由国家权力机关产生的，它们都要向国家权力机关负责和报告工作，并且要受国家权力机关的监督。所有这些，都说明我们的人民代表大会是我们国家中最有权力的组织，是人民意志的全权代表者。人民代表大会权力的高度集中，就能够实现人民权力的统一，能够把全国一切地方统一成为一个坚强有力的整体，使我们国家能够发挥强大的力量，来胜利地解决我们国家在过渡时期所面临的许多艰巨复杂的任务。
    资产阶级国家所实行的不是民主集中制，而是官僚主义集中制。在资产阶级国家里，并没有民主的基础，因而，资产阶级国家的实际权力都集中在不对代表机关和人民负责的官僚机构手里，官僚机构直接对人民群众实行暴力镇压。
    总之，我们根据民主集中制的人民代表大会制度建立起来的国家机关，是人民自己的机关，它和人民保持密切的联系，因此我们的国家机关也就有无穷无尽的力量，能够保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整；能够镇压一切叛国的和反革命的活动，保护全体公民的安全和权利；能够领导我国的社会主义建设事业，保证我国通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。
