Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 18th: On the eve of the ninth anniversary of Indonesia's independence, Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, in a speech to the parliament on the 16th outlining the achievements of the Indonesian government over the past year, reiterated his opposition to the Southeast Asia group and the Northwest Pacific group plotted by the United States.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said that when "defense groups" in Southeast Asia and the Northwest Pacific were being planned, "our independent and active foreign policy is facing another test." He continued: "Upon receiving invitations to participate in these activities, the government firmly refused to participate based on our independent policy, because in our view, its purpose is not to establish peace among nations. In particular, from the perspective of the Geneva Conference, which has delighted all Asian people, engaging in activities to establish collective defense in Southeast Asia and the Northwest Pacific can only bring about tension."

In his speech, Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo also discussed the results of the Indonesian-Dutch negotiations. He said that the Indonesian government believes that the dissolution of the Dutch-Indonesian Union and the termination of the Round Table Conference agreements "are important to the political life of our country and nation, and the shackles that have bound our spirit of freedom and independence have been broken." He said: "It is hoped that this gratifying and positive result can be used as a solid foundation for continuing the struggle for the complete independence and autonomy of the Republic of Indonesia."

Regarding the West Irian issue, Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said that Indonesia had raised the issue of West Irian several times during the Indonesian-Dutch negotiations, but the Netherlands refused to discuss it. He said: "We therefore protested against this unilateral action by the Netherlands. We firmly declare that we will resolve this issue ourselves."

    印尼总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约再次表示
    反对美国策划东南亚和西北太平洋集团
    【新华社雅加达十八日电】印尼宣布独立的九周年前夕，印尼总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约于十六日在国会论述过去一年印尼政府的成就时，再次表示反对美国策划的东南亚集团和西北太平洋集团。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理说，当东南亚和西北太平洋方面的“防御集团”正在策划中的时候，“我们的独立的、积极的外交政策正面对着另一次考验”。他接着说：“在接到关于参加这些活动的邀请的时候，政府根据我们的独立政策坚决拒绝参加，因为照我们的看法，它的目的并不在于建立世界各国间的和平。特别是，如果从已使得全亚洲人民感到欢欣的日内瓦会议的观点来看，从事建立东南亚和西北太平洋集体防务的活动只能带来紧张局势。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理在演说中又论述了印尼—荷兰谈判的结果。他说，印尼政府认为荷兰—印尼联邦的解散和各项圆桌会议协定的结束“对我们国家和民族的政治生命是重要的，过去束缚我们自由独立精神的镣铐已经被打破了”。他说：“希望这个令人感到欢欣的良好结果，可以用来作为继续为争取印尼共和国的完全独立和自主而斗争的巩固基础”。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理在谈到西伊里安问题时说，在印尼—荷兰谈判中，印尼曾经数次提出西伊里安问题，荷兰都拒绝讨论。他说：“我们因此对荷兰这一片面行动提出抗议。我们坚决地声明，我们要自己解决这一问题。”
