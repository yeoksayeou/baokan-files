    Khrushchev Collective Farm and its Female Chairman
    ——A Visit to Ukraine, Part Four
    By our reporter Li He
    A highway cuts through the vast and flat fields without boundaries. Golden wheat is ripening on both sides. Under the cloudless sky and blazing sun, they look like golden felt carpets spread across the land. Square-clustered corn, taller than a person, is as neat as a low forest. The green leaves of sugar beets cover the ground, looking like a sea from afar. A group of square huts with thatched roofs and white walls peeks through the dense woods, watching the silent wilderness. We spent the whole day traveling back and forth in this wheat and sugar beet producing area by car.

    We passed through picturesque southern fields and met a middle-aged, robust Ukrainian woman in the small office of the Khrushchev Collective Farm's management department. Based on her amiable face that we had seen in the newspaper, we had already recognized her as Galina Yevgenyevna Burkatskaya, the female chairman of this collective farm. This simple hero of socialist labor, not wearing a Gold Star Medal, dressed in an ordinary peasant woman's cloth shirt, humbly talked about the collective farm's affairs at length.

    The Khrushchev Collective Farm includes three villages and 712 farm households. It has more than a thousand hectares of land, planting 350 hectares of wheat, as well as barley, rye, corn and other crops. Its livestock farm raises more than 400 head of cattle and hundreds of pigs, sheep, poultry and horses. Its diversified economy is thriving. Perhaps this is due to the fertile land? The land in the Ukrainian black soil belt is fertile, but the land of this collective farm is barren sandy loam. The elderly say that wheat did not grow here before, and corn only yielded 160 to 210 kilograms per hectare in the best years. Farmers worked hard all year round and had difficulty making a living. In the era of Soviet power, after taking the path of collectivization, the lives of collective farmers became prosperous. With the help of the Cherkasy Machine Tractor Station, all the heavy work of plowing, sowing, and harvesting in this collective farm is completed by machines in a timely and careful manner in accordance with agricultural techniques. In 1953, despite the bad weather, this collective farm still harvested 2,120 kilograms of grain per hectare, 17,100 kilograms of sugar beet per hectare, and 15,100 kilograms of potatoes per hectare. In this year, the farm's cash income was 4.3 million rubles; the remuneration for each workday was ten rubles.

    Burkatskaya believes that the enthusiasm of the farm members, the diligence in inspection by the leadership, and the guarantee of Party work are decisive for the development of production. She said: The farm members all abide by discipline and love labor. Some do not leave work until the job is done, sometimes earning four workdays in a day. The socialist system of more work, more pay encourages everyone. The management department holds one or two meetings a week, including active elements of responsible cadres of various units, to check the work of the week. Each production team has a work plan, and the agronomist patrols the fields every day on a motorized bicycle to check the work, sometimes revising the plan according to the actual situation. The farm has thirteen Party members, distributed in various production teams in the three villages, playing a core role. Most of the Party member meetings are held openly to absorb the opinions of the masses. The Party organization regularly listens to the work reports of the chairman of the collective farm or the captain of the production team, and supports and supervises the implementation of the production plan.

    After the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union last year, in addition to the agronomist, a livestock technician was added to the work in the Khrushchev Collective Farm. Other cadres have completed technical cadre training courses and are able to work competently, so there have been no replacements. The September Plenary Session put forward the task of greatly increasing the output of agricultural products in two or three years; all the farm members of the Khrushchev Collective Farm are working hard to complete the task ahead of schedule. They adopted the advanced method of square-cluster planting for corn. They pay special attention to accumulating manure and applying fertilizer. In 1953, they applied 13.1 tons of organic fertilizer and 390 kilograms of mineral fertilizer per hectare of land, and even more this year. Manure is transported directly from the livestock farm to the fields and piled up. The newly built livestock farms all have devices for collecting manure water, which is supplied to vegetable and potato fields. The first field production team has a plan to collect grass ash and chicken manure.

    Large-scale construction is underway on the farm. Last year, pig houses, cow houses, and horse houses were built, all of which are brick-built and covered with red tiles. These livestock farms are mechanized, equipped with automatic drinkers, overhead rails, and feed cookers, and there are comfortable rest rooms for the livestock farm members next to them. Many of the livestock farm buildings I have seen are not so exquisite and solid. A cow house costs 240,000 rubles, while the usual cost is 100,000 rubles. The female chairman also enthusiastically took us to see a collective farm club that had already been built with foundations and walls. This year, a club, a 200-kilowatt power plant, a cow house, a flour mill, and so on will be built. This year's construction cost is 800,000 rubles, accounting for 20 percent of the cash income. From this, we can see the strong economic strength of this collective farm.

    Burkatskaya believes that it is beneficial to the development of the collective farm to vigorously carry out production construction under the condition of paying attention to appropriate labor-day remuneration. It is not right to unilaterally increase labor-day remuneration and ignore production construction. The construction plan should also have a long-term vision, and solid buildings are durable, require less repair, and are cost-effective in the end.

    The achievements of the Khrushchev Collective Farm are inseparable from the efforts of its chairman, Burkatskaya. Burkatskaya is a rural woman who has been tempered and grown up from labor and overcoming difficulties. Some young people in our country do not fully understand that labor, especially agricultural labor, is a very good school. Therefore, I asked Burkatskaya to describe her own life experience.

    We know that the Soviet national education system guarantees rural children seven years of compulsory education, and they have ample opportunities to continue their schooling. However, there are also many rural youth who devote themselves to agricultural production at a very early age and continue to study without leaving the production area. Their work is outstanding, and their knowledge is constantly improving, and therefore they are highly respected by society. Burkatskaya is one of them.

    Burkatskaya is thirty-eight years old this year. In the year she finished the seventh grade (approximately equivalent to junior high school) at the age of fifteen, she wanted to continue her studies very much, but in order to take care of her younger brother, she started working at the age of seventeen and joined the Communist Youth League. She worked in the village and district Soviets, and also did the work of the Communist Youth League. At the age of twenty-one, she was sent to a school for training Party and League agricultural workers, where she studied for one year. After that, she continued to work. She wanted to study while working, but the war started. During the Great Patriotic War, she worked as an accountant. Her husband died in the war, leaving behind a son and a daughter. The sacrifice of her husband made her very sad. But she wanted to comfort the women in the village who had lost their husbands. Her words of comfort to them were also meant for herself. She and the women who shared the same suffering became stronger in overcoming difficulties. She took her children to work as an ordinary farm member in the collective farm. In 1946, she became a formal Party member. In 1947, she became the secretary of the Party branch of the collective farm. In 1949, at the age of thirty-three, she was elected as the chairman of the collective farm. Under her leadership, the Khrushchev Collective Farm leaped into the ranks of the advanced. She was elected as a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. After the war, the burden that Burkatskaya carried became heavier year by year. She had to lead the entire collective farm, take on many social tasks, and also take care of her children. But she did not relax her studies. In 1951, she entered the six-year correspondence course of the Kiev Agricultural Academy and has already studied for four years. The first year was very difficult, but now she is used to it. Her son has finished the eighth grade, and her daughter has finished the fourth grade. The whole family is studying. She said: Now, looking back, if you don't study while working, there will be more difficulties in your work.

    This year, this female chairman of the collective farm was elected as a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for the second time. She said: Thank the voters for their trust in her, and if you are trusted, you should work better. She maintains close contact with the masses and solves the demands of the masses as soon as possible. Every day, people come to her office or home to find her, and they bring everything to discuss. For example, recently 62 middle school students graduated and asked her where to go to study or work. She has talked to more than 30 people. She receives many letters from the masses every month, an average of three to five a day. Every letter is answered. The demands raised in the letters are handled by herself if she can handle them, and if she cannot handle them, she transfers them to the relevant parties and informs the letter writers. For example, many people wrote letters saying that out of patriotic enthusiasm, they wanted to come to work at the Khrushchev Collective Farm; but this collective farm can only accept a part of them, and the rest are introduced to other places. She often pays attention to major events in life and major demands of the masses, and puts forward suggestions to the Supreme Soviet, such as proposing the development of water conservancy projects and other issues. She said: As a Soviet representative, the most important principle is to handle the affairs of the masses in accordance with the laws of the country.

    赫鲁晓夫集体农庄和它的女主席
    ——乌克兰访问记之四
    本报记者　李何
    一条公路插在没有田界的广阔平坦的田野中间。两旁金黄的小麦正在成熟。在长天无云，烈日照耀之下，它们像铺在大地上的金毡。方形簇种的玉米，高过人头，整齐得如同矮林。遍地甜菜的绿叶，远望好似大海。一群茅顶白墙的方形小屋，透过浓茂的树林窥看着沉寂的旷野。我们整天乘着汽车在这小麦和甜菜的产区上往返。
    我们穿过如画的南方田野，在赫鲁晓夫集体农庄管理部的不大的办公室里，会见了一位中年健壮的乌克兰女儿。凭着在报上见过的她的和蔼的脸孔，我们已经认出她是这个集体农庄的女主席加琳娜·叶甫杰甫娜·布尔卡茨卡雅。这位朴素的社会主义劳动英雄，没有佩带金星章，穿着普通农妇穿的布衫子，谦逊地长谈了集体农庄的事情。
    赫鲁晓夫集体农庄，包括三个村子，七百十二户庄员。它有一千多公顷土地，种着三百五十公顷小麦，还种着大麦、黑麦、玉米等等庄稼。它的饲畜场喂着四百多头牛和数以百计的猪、羊、家禽和马。它的多种经济欣欣向荣。也许这是由于土地肥沃吧？乌克兰黑土地带的土地是肥沃的，但这个集体农庄的土地是贫瘠的沙壤。老年人说：以前这里小麦不长，玉米在年成最好时每公顷只收一百六十到二百一十公斤。农民终年辛苦，难于度日。在苏维埃政权时代，经过集体化道路，集体农民的生活富裕起来了。在切尔卡斯机器拖拉机站的帮助下，这个集体农庄的所有犁地、播种、收割等等繁重的工作都是用机器及时地、仔细地按照农作技术完成的。在一九五三年，虽然天年不好，这个集体农庄还是收获了谷物每公顷二千一百二十公斤，甜菜每公顷一万七千一百公斤，马铃薯每公顷一万五千一百公斤。这一年，农庄收入现金四百三十万卢布；每个劳动日的报酬是十个卢布。
    庄员的积极性，领导上的勤于检查，党工作的保证，布尔卡茨卡雅认为对于发展生产是有决定意义的。她说：庄员们都遵守纪律，爱好劳动。有的工作没有做完不下工，有时一天得到四个劳动日。多劳多得的社会主义制度鼓励着每个人。管理部每星期举行一两次包括各单位负责干部的积极分子会议，检查一星期的工作。各生产队工作都有计划，农艺师每天乘着机器脚踏车巡察田间，检查工作，有时根据实际情况修正计划。农庄有十三个党员，分布在三个村的各个生产队里，起着核心的作用。党员大会大部分公开举行，以吸收群众的意见。党的组织经常听取集体农庄主席或生产队队长的工作报告，支持和监督生产计划的执行。
    苏共中央去年九月全会以后，在赫鲁晓夫集体农庄工作的，除了农艺师以外，还加了饲畜技师。其他干部都念完技术干部训练班，能够胜任地工作，所以没有什么更换。九月全会提出了在两三年内大大提高农业品产量的任务；赫鲁晓夫集体农庄全体庄员努力提前完成任务。他们对玉米采取了方形簇种的先进方法。他们特别注意积粪施肥。在一九五三年在每公顷田地上施了十三·一吨有机肥料和三百九十公斤矿质肥料，今年施的还多。畜粪从饲畜场直接运到田间堆积起来。新盖的饲畜场所都有收集粪水的装置，粪水供给蔬菜和马铃薯田地。第一田间生产队有收集草灰和鸡粪的计划。
    大规模的建筑在农庄进行着。去年建筑了猪房、牛房、马房，都是砖砌的，盖着红瓦。这些饲畜场都是机械化的，装置有自动饮水器、吊轨、饲料蒸煮器，旁边有舒适的饲畜庄员的休息室。我见过的许多饲畜场的建筑，都没有这样讲究和坚固。一座牛房费用二十四万卢布，平常的十万卢布就够了。女主席还兴致勃勃地带我们看了一座已经筑好地基和墙壁的集体农庄俱乐部。在今年要建筑俱乐部、二百瓩的电力厂、母牛房、磨粉厂等等。今年建筑费八十万卢布，占现金收入的百分之二十。从这可见这个集体农庄经济力量的雄厚。
    布尔卡茨卡雅认为：在注意适当的劳动日报酬的条件下，大力进行生产建筑，对于集体农庄的发展，是有好处的。片面地提高劳动日报酬而忽略生产建筑，是不对的。建筑计划也要有长远的眼光，坚固的建筑物耐用，少修理，到头来还是合算。
    赫鲁晓夫集体农庄的成就和它的主席布尔卡茨卡雅的努力是分不开的。布尔卡茨卡雅是一个从劳动和克服困难中锻炼和成长起来的农村妇女。我国有些青年不完全了解劳动尤其是农业劳动是很好的学校。因此我请布尔卡茨卡雅叙述了自己的身世。
    我们知道，苏联的国民教育保证农村儿童受到七年义务教育，并且有继续受学校教育的充分机会。但是也有许多农村青年，他们很早就投身农业生产，不脱离生产地继续学习。他们的工作很出色，他们的知识也不断提高，因而受到社会的很大尊敬。布尔卡茨卡雅就是这样的一个。
    布尔卡茨卡雅今年三十八岁。在十五岁那一年念完七年级（约等于初中），很想继续升学，但是为了带养弟弟，十七岁就开始工作，入了青年团。先后在村、区苏维埃做事，也做青年团的工作。二十一岁被送到培养党团农业工作人员的学校，读了
  一年。以后又继续工作。想一面工作一面学习，但战争开始了。在卫国战争时期，当会计。她的丈夫在战争中牺牲了，留下一男一女。丈夫的牺牲，使她非常伤心。但她要抚慰同庄失掉丈夫的妇女。她抚慰她们的话，也就是对她自己说的。她和同患难的妇女就这样在克服困难中更加坚强起来。她带着孩子在集体农庄当普通庄员。一九四六年成为正式党员。一九四七年当了集体农庄党支部书记。一九四九年，三十三岁，被选为集体农庄主席。在她的领导下，赫鲁晓夫集体农庄跃进先进的行列。她被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表和乌克兰共产党中央委员会委员。战后，布尔卡茨卡雅挑的担子一年比一年沉重。要领导全集体农庄，又要担任许多社会工作，还要带孩子。但她没有放松学习。一九五一年进了基辅农业学院的六年制函授班，已经念了四年。第一年很难，现在已经习惯了。她的儿子已念完八年级，女儿念完四年级。全家都在学习。她说：现在回想，如果在劳动时不学习，工作中困难会更多。　　这位集体农庄女主席今年第二次被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。她说：感谢选民对她的信任，受了信任就应当工作得更好。她和群众保持密切的接触，尽快解决群众的要求。每天有人来办公室或家里来找她，什么事情都拿来商量。例如最近有六十二名中学生毕业了，向她请教去那里升学或工作。她已和三十多个人谈过话。她每月收到许多群众来信，每天平均三、五封。每封信都一定作答。来信所提的要求，自己能处理的就自己处理了，不能处理的转到有关方面，并且通知来信人。例如，许多人来信说，出于爱国主义的热情，想到赫鲁晓夫集体农庄来工作；但这个集体农庄只能接受一部分，其余的就介绍到别处去了。她经常注意生活中重大的事情和群众的重大要求，向最高苏维埃提出建议，例如提出发展水利工程等等问题。她说：作为苏维埃代表，最重要的原则是按照国家的法律来办群众的事情。
