The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people. Their task is to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to safeguard the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty. - Article 20 of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China

Editor's Note: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, together with the people of the whole country, fought heroically, overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and achieved the great victory of the people's revolution. The Draft Constitution is the crystallization of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. It records the great achievements of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and stipulates the goals of the Chinese people's future struggle. Therefore, the Draft Constitution inspires the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for building socialism and awakens the determination of the people's army to defend the fruits of the revolutionary victory and socialist construction. As soon as the Draft Constitution was published, all units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers carried out studies and launched heated discussions. Every commander and fighter expressed their determination to heighten vigilance and strictly guard against the conspiracies of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The following articles express the high patriotic enthusiasm and firm determination of the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army to defend the motherland.

On the evening of June 25th, we visited six veteran Red Army cadres, Comrades Long Qian, Liu Yubiao, Zhang Wenbi, Xiong Yingtang, Zhu Yaohua, and Li Binshan, who were studying at a certain school in the East China Military Region. Although their studies were very intensive, since the publication of the Draft Constitution, most of them had repeatedly and carefully read it several times. When we went to visit them and asked them to talk about their thoughts after reading the Draft Constitution, they excitedly talked to us until late at night.

These six veteran Red Army cadres all came from poor handicraft or farming families and joined the revolution in the early days of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. Some of them had experienced the Kuomintang bandit gang's five comprehensive encirclements and suppressions of the Red Army, some had experienced the 25,000-li Long March, and some had experienced the three-year guerrilla war in the southern provinces. They all experienced the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War. Under the test of long-term revolutionary wars, in the environment of arduous and unyielding struggle, and under the education of the Party, they have always loyally dedicated themselves to the people's revolutionary cause and have been trained to become leading cadres in the army. At present, although some of them have gray hair, they are still diligently studying in order to better complete the tasks entrusted to them by the Party.

When the Draft Constitution was mentioned, they felt particularly excited and cordial, and it also evoked their memories of the revolutionary struggle over the past twenty years. From these memories, we deeply realized that the Draft Constitution is the victorious fruit of the Chinese people's arduous struggle, bloodshed, and sacrifice. Comrade Xiong Yingtang recounted the combat life during the five encirclements and suppressions, Comrade Zhu Yaohua recounted the unforgettable days during the Long March, and Comrade Zhang Wenbi recounted the situation of the three-year guerrilla war in the southern provinces after the main force of the Red Army went north. Comrade Xiong Yingtang said: "At that time, the enemy ridiculed us, laughing at us for eating wild grass and belts, and using earthen guns, saying that it was impossible to make a revolution. However, now we have won and become one of the world's major powers. Our Draft Constitution has also been promulgated. This is a victory epic for the Chinese people, which makes us feel proud. For those imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, it is a death sentence, declaring that the era when they ruled China and oppressed the Chinese people is over forever." Comrade Zhu Yaohua said: "The victory achieved by the Chinese people and the promulgation of the Draft Constitution were indeed not easy things. It was the result of nearly a century of heroic struggle. Taking our army as an example, we have grown from small to large, from weak to strong, and have gone through a long, arduous, tortuous, and glorious combat road. Countless comrades-in-arms sacrificed themselves, shedding their last drop of blood for the cause of the people's revolution. But even then, when climbing snowy mountains, crossing grasslands, wading through dangerous rivers, eating wild grass, and gnawing on belts, the Red Army always held a firm belief in victory, believing that one day they would defeat the ferocious enemy and enable the broad masses of people to live a democratic, free, and happy life. The Draft Constitution summarizes the history of the Chinese people's long-term struggle and consolidates this victory that our people have already won. Recalling the struggles of the past twenty years makes us more deeply aware of its great significance." Comrade Zhang Wenbi recalled the scene of persisting in the guerrilla war in the eastern Zhejiang region and sharing weal and woe with the local people and fighting against the enemy, and said: The reason why the Red Army was able to persevere and defeat the enemy in those years was precisely because they understood that they were the people's army, an army fighting for the people.

The conversation naturally turned to our country's socialist construction and bright and splendid future. Comrade Zhu Yaohua said: "During the Long March, socialism was still a distant ideal, but it was this ideal that encouraged us to endure hardships, not fear difficulties, and complete the 25,000-li journey step by step. Now, socialist construction has become the general task of our country. Realizing a socialist society has become the common aspiration of the broad masses of our people. The great significance of the Draft Constitution lies in the fact that it transforms this aspiration into the statutory goal of our people's struggle." Comrade Liu Yubiao said: "The Draft Constitution is a powerful guarantee for our country to move towards socialism. With it, our people will forever move from victory to victory."

Article 20 of the Draft Constitution: "The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people. Their task is to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to safeguard the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty." It particularly attracted everyone's attention. They talked about how to earnestly fulfill the glorious tasks entrusted to them by the Party, the state, and the people in their respective work posts in the future. Comrade Li Binshan said: "Whether we can implement the spirit of the Draft Constitution, as well as the various policies and guidelines of the Party and the government, in the army, the key issue lies in the leading cadres. Only when we first study and understand the Draft Constitution can we educate the troops. Studying the Draft Constitution is also studying the struggle experience and organizational experience of the Chinese revolution, which is a very important thing for us." Comrade Zhu Yaohua said: "History has proven that the enemy has never been reconciled to our victory, and this is even more true today. The tasks stipulated for us in the Draft Constitution further increase the responsibility of our army for modernization." Comrade Long Qian said: "Since its birth, our Chinese People's Liberation Army has come from the people and belongs to the people. Under the teaching of the Party and Chairman Mao, our Chinese People's Liberation Army has always loyally dedicated itself to the cause of the people's revolution. It is precisely because of this that we have been able to grow from small to large, from weak to strong, achieved the victory of the revolution, and grown into a strong and invincible people's army. Today, our country is in a new period of gradually transitioning to socialism, and the situation of struggle is very sharp and complex. Our people's army should further promote the noble qualities of cherishing the people and serving the people, continue to maintain the fine tradition of hard work and plain living, closely rely on the people, unite the people, and jointly fight against American aggression, recover our territory Taiwan, and build socialism."

   人民的胜利，人民的愿望
   孙皓月　朱新楣
  中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整。中华人民共和国宪法草案第二十条
    编者按：中国人民解放军，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，和全国人民一道，英勇奋斗，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利。宪法草案正是中国人民革命斗争的结晶，它记录了中国人民革命斗争的伟大成果，并规定了中国人民今后奋斗的目标。因此，宪法草案鼓舞了我国人民建设社会主义的热情，唤起了人民军队保卫革命胜利成果和社会主义建设的决心。宪法草案一公布，中国人民解放军和志愿军各部队都纷纷进行了学习，展开了热烈的讨论。每一个指挥员和战士，都表示要提高警惕，严防美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的阴谋活动。这里发表的几篇文章，表现了人民解放军指战员的爱国主义的高度热情和保卫祖国的坚强决心。
    六月二十五日晚上，我们访问了正在华东军区某校学习的六位红军老干部龙潜、刘毓标、张文碧、熊应堂、朱耀华、李彬山等同志。学习虽很紧张，但是在宪法草案公布以来，他们大都已把宪法草案反复仔细阅读了好几遍。在我们去访问他们，要求他们谈谈宪法草案读后的感想时，他们都兴奋地和我们一直谈到夜深。
    这六位红军老干部都出身于贫苦的手工业者或农民家庭，在第二次国内革命战争初期就参加了革命。他们有的经历过国民党匪帮对红军的五次全面围攻，有的经历过二万五千里长征，有的经历过在南方各省所坚持的三年游击战争，他们都经历过抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争。在长期的革命战争考验下，在艰苦卓绝的斗争环境中，在党的教养下，他们一直是忠诚地献身于人民革命事业，锻炼成为军队中的领导干部。目前，他们虽然有的已白发斑斑，但是为了更好地完成党所托付的任务，他们又在勤勉地学习着。
    一提起宪法草案，他们分外地感到兴奋和亲切，也引起了他们对二十多年来革命斗争的回忆。从这些回忆中，使我们深切地体会到宪法草案是我国人民艰苦奋斗流血牺牲的胜利果实。熊应堂同志叙述了五次围攻时期的战斗生活，朱耀华同志叙述了长征途中的难忘的日子，张文碧同志叙述了红军主力北上后在南方各省所坚持的三年游击战争的情形。熊应堂同志说：“那时候，敌人讥笑我们，笑我们吃的是野草和皮带，用的是土枪，要革他们的命万万办不到。可是，现在我们胜利了，成为世界上的大国之一。我们的宪法草案也公布了，这对于我国人民来说是一部胜利的史诗，它使我们感到自豪；对于那些帝国主义者、蒋介石匪帮，它是一份死亡判决书，宣告他们以前统治中国压迫中国人民的时代是永远地结束了。”朱耀华同志说：“中国人民取得的胜利和宪法草案的公布，确实不是容易的事情，而是经过了近百年的英勇斗争，拿我们军队来说，我们从小到大，从弱到强，经过了漫长的艰苦曲折的光荣的战斗道路，无数的战友牺牲了，为了人民革命事业他们流了最后一滴血。但是就是在那时候，在爬雪山，过草地，涉险流，吃野草，啃皮带的时候，红军始终怀着坚定的胜利信念，都相信总有一天会打倒凶恶的敌人，使广大人民过民主自由的幸福日子。宪法草案总结了中国人民长期奋斗的历史，并把我国人民已经争取到的这一胜利巩固起来。回想一下二十多年来的斗争，更会深刻认识到它的伟大意义。”张文碧同志回忆了在浙东地区坚持游击战争时期和当地人民同甘苦共患难，与敌人作斗争的情景后说：当年红军所以能够坚持下来，战胜敌人，正是因为他们懂得自己是人民的队伍，是为人民而战的军队。
    谈话自然而然地转到了我们国家的社会主义建设和光明灿烂的前途。朱耀华同志说：“长征时候，社会主义还是一个遥远的理想，但是就是它鼓舞了我们忍受艰辛，不怕困难，一步一步地走完了二万五千里的路程。现在，社会主义建设已成为我们国家的总任务了。实现社会主义社会已经是我国广大人民的共同愿望。宪法草案的伟大意义，就在于它把这个愿望变为我国人民法定的奋斗目标。”刘毓标同志说：“宪法草案是我国走向社会主义的有力保证，我国人民有了它，会永远从胜利走向胜利。”
    宪法草案第二十条：“中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整。”它特别引起大家的注意。他们联系各自不同的工作岗位，漫谈了怎样在今后切实地完成党和国家及人民所托付的光荣任务。李彬山同志说：“我们能否在军队中贯彻宪法草案的精神，以及党和政府的各种方针和政策，关键问题在于领导干部。只有我们首先把宪法草案加以研究领会，我们才能够教育部队；学习宪法草案，也就是学习中国革命的斗争经验和组织经验，这对于我们是一件十分重要的事情。”朱耀华同志说：“历史证明了，敌人对于我们的胜利是从来不甘心的，今天更是如此。宪法草案规定给我们的任务，更加重了我军现代化建设的责任。”龙潜同志说：“我们中国人民解放军从诞生以来，就是来自人民、属于人民，在党和毛主席的教导下，我们中国人民解放军一直是忠诚地献身于人民革命事业。正因为这样，我们才能够从小到大，从弱到强，取得了革命的胜利，发展壮大成为一支强大无敌的人民军队。今天我们的国家正处在逐步过渡到社会主义的新时期，斗争形势非常尖锐复杂，我们人民军队更应该发扬爱护人民、为人民服务的高贵品质，继续保持艰苦朴素的优良传统，紧紧地依靠人民团结人民，共同为反对美国侵略、收复我国领土台湾和建设社会主义而奋斗。”
