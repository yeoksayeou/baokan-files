    The first National Conference on Farmers' Amateur Cultural Education, jointly convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the Committee for Eliminating Illiteracy of the Central People's Government, opened in Beijing on the 6th.

    The main purpose of this conference is to, in accordance with the requirements of the general task of the state during the transition period, examine and summarize the work of farmers' amateur cultural education over the past year and more, and determine the future direction and tasks of farmers' amateur cultural education, so that farmers' amateur cultural education can adapt to the needs of the socialist transformation of agriculture and actively serve the general task of the state during the transition period.

    Chu Tunan, Director of the Committee for Eliminating Illiteracy of the Central People's Government, delivered the opening speech. He pointed out that after the general line of the state during the transition period was put forward, a vigorous publicity and education campaign on the general line was carried out in rural areas, the socialist consciousness of farmers was raised, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas was widely developed. With the development of agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the role of culture in agricultural production has become increasingly important. Therefore, carrying out farmers' amateur cultural education and improving the cultural level of farmers has become an important task of the state during the transition period.

    Chu Tunan pointed out: In the past period, national farmers' amateur cultural education has achieved certain results. In the past year, 12 million farmers have persisted in year-round study, and more than 19 million farmers have participated in winter literacy classes. At the end of the 1953 winter literacy campaign, 3.08 million illiterate people were eliminated among farmers on the basis of past work. However, due to the mismatch between the way rural literacy work was handled and the overall work situation of the country, there had been a tendency of blind and rash advance. Over the past year or more, in accordance with the principle of "consolidation and steady progress," various localities have corrected this deviation, so that rural literacy work has been initially incorporated into the track of national construction, laying the foundation for carrying out farmers' amateur cultural education in the future.

    Chu Tunan pointed out: There are many favorable conditions for carrying out farmers' amateur cultural education at present. Due to the widespread development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, the demand of farmers for learning culture has increased anew. Some places have begun to establish learning organizations on the basis of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, creating new forms of combining learning with production. The number of graduates from senior primary schools and junior middle schools and literacy graduates engaged in agricultural production will gradually increase in the future, so there are more sources of teachers. In addition, some experience has been accumulated in the work of the past few years, especially in the past year or more, and the work has a certain foundation. However, we must also see the difficult side of the work. Eliminating illiteracy among hundreds of millions of farmers is still an arduous historical task, which cannot be completed in a short period of time and requires a considerable period of struggle. The direction and tasks of farmers' amateur cultural education are not yet very clear; the organization and leadership are still very weak, and there are still negative emotions and a lack of responsibility in some places; textbooks, teaching methods, etc. have not yet been properly resolved. He asked the delegates to the conference to discuss these issues well and effectively resolve them.

    Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government, made a report on the current direction and tasks of farmers' amateur cultural education and several issues at the meeting on the 6th.

    The meeting will begin group discussions from the 7th.

    More than 150 people attended the meeting, including the heads of literacy work departments of major regions, provinces, and cities, representatives of education departments, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the propaganda departments of provincial and municipal party committees, and representatives of relevant central government agencies.

    全国农民业余文化教育会议在北京开幕
    中央人民政府教育部和中央人民政府扫除文盲工作委员会联合召开的第一次全国农民业余文化教育会议六日在北京开幕。
    这次会议主要是根据国家在过渡时期的总任务的要求，检查和总结一年多来农民业余文化教育工作，并确定今后农民业余文化教育的方针和任务，使农民业余文化教育能适应农业社会主义改造的需要，积极地为国家过渡时期的总任务服务。
    中央人民政府扫除文盲工作委员会主任委员楚图南致开幕词。他指出，在国家过渡时期的总任务提出后，农村中大张旗鼓地进行了总路线的宣传教育，农民的社会主义觉悟有了提高，农村互助合作运动有了广泛的开展，随着农业生产和互助合作运动的发展，文化在农业生产中的作用已越来越重要，因此开展农民业余文化教育，提高农民的文化水平，已是国家在过渡时期的一项重要的工作。
    楚图南指出：在过去一个时期中，全国农民业余文化教育已取得了一定的成绩。在过去一年中，坚持常年学习的农民有一千二百万人，参加冬学文化学习的农民达一千九百多万人。一九五三年冬学结束时，在过去工作的基础上，在农民中扫除了文盲三百零八万人。但由于对农村扫盲工作的摆法和国家整个工作情况不相称曾发生过盲目冒进的偏向。一年多以来，各地根据“整顿巩固、稳步前进”的方针，纠正了这种偏向，使农村的扫盲工作初步纳入国家建设的轨道，为今后开展农民业余文化教育打下了基础。
    楚图南指出：目前开展农民业余文化教育有很多有利的条件。由于农业生产互助合作运动的广泛开展，农民学习文化的要求有了新的增长，有些地方已开始在农业生产互助合作的基础上建立了学习组织，创造了学习与生产相结合的新形式。从事农业生产的高小、初中毕业生和扫盲毕业的学员往后将会逐年增加，因此，师资有了较多的来源。此外在几年来特别是最近一年多来的工作中积累了一些经验，工作有了一定的基础。但是，也要看到工作中困难的一面，扫除几亿农民中的文盲还是一个艰巨的历史任务，这个任务不是短时期内所能完成的，要经过一个相当长时期的斗争。农民业余文化教育的方针和任务还没有十分明确；组织领导还很薄弱，有些地方还存在着消极情绪和无人负责的现象，教材、教法等还没有得到妥善解决。他要求到会代表在这次会议中很好地讨论，切实地解决这些问题。
    中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会秘书长钱俊瑞在六日会议上作了当前农民业余文化教育的方针任务和若干问题的报告。
    会议从七日起将开始分组讨论。
    出席这次会议的有各大区、省、市扫盲工作部门的负责人和教育部门、青年团中央、省、市委宣传部门的代表以及中央有关机关的代表共一百五十多人。                              （新华社）
