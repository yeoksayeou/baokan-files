Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 6th. The first session of the First People's Congress of Xinjiang Province was held in Urumqi in late July. Three hundred and thirty representatives from various ethnic groups and social strata of Xinjiang Province attended the meeting.

At the meeting, Bao Erhan, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Xinjiang Branch Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Saifuddin, Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Constitution Draft Discussion Committee and Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Election Committee, Gao Jinchun, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, and others delivered reports. The contents of these reports were: "Work Summary of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government for Nine Months," "Striving to Implement the General Task of the State During the Transition Period in the Xinjiang Region," "On the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China," "Basic Summary of the General Election Work in Xinjiang Province," and "Striving to Further Improve Agricultural, Forestry, Animal Husbandry Production and Water Conservancy Construction," etc.

The delegates carefully discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, believing that the various provisions in the draft constitution fully conformed to the interests of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country. In the future, the draft constitution should be extensively publicized and discussed among the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Xinjiang, and opinions should be sought from the people of all ethnic groups. The delegates also believed that continuing to promote ethnic regional autonomy in Xinjiang is an urgent task at present. At present, the establishment and preparation for the establishment of ethnic autonomous regions at all levels are being actively carried out in order to further develop the political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

The meeting reviewed the work of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government for nine months, discussed how to specifically implement the state's general task during the transition period in the Xinjiang region, and further improve agricultural and animal husbandry production and water conservancy construction; and put forward suggestions for improvement on some shortcomings existing in the current government work. The meeting believes that since the liberation of Xinjiang, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, unprecedented national unity has been achieved, a democratic regime has been established, land reform has been completed in agricultural areas with a population of approximately four million, and ethnic regional autonomy has been promoted in a step-by-step manner. At present, a total of 33 autonomous regions at or below the prefecture level have been established in the province. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas is developing steadily, and the organized farmers account for approximately 33.84 percent of the total number of farmers in the province. In pastoral areas, due to the correct implementation of animal husbandry policies, the number of livestock of the vast number of herdsmen and state-owned farms has greatly increased. In particular, thanks to the support of the people of the whole country, the assistance of the great friendly country, the Soviet Union, and the help of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Xinjiang, many modern industries have emerged in the Xinjiang region, laying a good economic foundation for the continued development of agricultural and animal husbandry production in the future. The meeting also focused on carrying out thorough and detailed discussions on striving to complete and overfulfill the 1954 agricultural and animal husbandry production plans.

The meeting received a total of 755 proposals on the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production and cultural, educational, and health undertakings. After being sorted and arranged by the Proposal Review Committee, a report on the review of the proposals was made, and they will be sent to the relevant departments for handling.

At the end of the meeting, by means of a secret ballot, Wang Enmao, Zhang Bangying, Lu Jianren (the above are of Han ethnicity), Saifuddin, Bao Erhan, Saifulaev, Yiminov, Muyiti, Abuliezi. Muhamaiti, Maimaiti Niyaz Hali, Yimin Mahsut, Maimaiti Niyaz, Sailima Talifuwa (female), Mernisha Khan Aini (female), Ayimujiang (female) (the above are all of Uyghur ethnicity), Patihan Suguerbayev, Anivar Jakulin (the above are of Kazakh ethnicity), Yu Zhanlin (Hui ethnicity), Dashap (Mongolian ethnicity), Maimaiti Aisha (Kyrgyz ethnicity), Aisihati (Tatar ethnicity) and other twenty-one people were elected as delegates from Xinjiang Province to attend the National People's Congress meeting.

    【新华社乌鲁木齐六日电】新疆省第一届第一次人民代表大会会议七月下旬在乌鲁木齐市举行。出席会议的有新疆省各民族、各阶层的代表三百三十人。
    会上，新疆省人民政府主席鲍尔汉，中共中央新疆分局第一书记王恩茂，新疆省宪法草案讨论委员会主任、新疆省选举委员会主席赛福鼎，新疆省人民政府副主席高锦纯等分别作了报告。这些报告的内容是：新疆省人民政府九个月的工作总结、“为在新疆地区贯彻国家过渡时期总任务而奋斗”、
  “关于中华人民共和国宪法草案”、“关于新疆省普选工作的基本总结”和“为进一步做好农林畜牧生产和水利建设而努力”等。
    代表们认真讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案，认为宪法草案中的各项规定是完全符合全国各族人民利益的。今后应在全新疆各族各界人民群众中深入广泛地宣传和讨论宪法草案，征求各民族人民群众的意见。代表们还认为在新疆继续推行民族区域自治是当前刻不容缓的工作。目前正在积极建立和准备建立各级的民族自治区，以便进一步发展新疆各民族的政治、经济、文化建设事业。
    会议审查了新疆省人民政府九个月的工作，讨论了在新疆地区如何具体贯彻国家在过渡时期的总任务和进一步作好农牧业生产和水利建设等问题；并对目前政府工作中存在的若干缺点，提出了改进意见。会议认为：自从新疆解放以来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，实现了空前未有的民族大团结，建设了民主政权，在约有四百万人口的农业地区完成了土地改革，有步骤地推行了民族区域自治，目前全省已建立了专区级以下的自治区共三十三个。农村的互助合作运动正稳步向前发展，组织起来的农户约占全省农户总数的百分之三十三点八四。在牧区由于正确贯彻执行了畜牧业政策，使广大牧民和国营牧场的牲畜数量有很大增加。特别是由于全国人民的支援、伟大友邦苏联的援助和驻新疆的人民解放军部队的帮助，新疆地区已出现了很多近代化的工业，为今后继续发展农牧业生产奠定了良好的经济基础。会议还着重对争取完成与超额完成一九五四年的农业和牧业生产计划作了周密详尽的讨论。
