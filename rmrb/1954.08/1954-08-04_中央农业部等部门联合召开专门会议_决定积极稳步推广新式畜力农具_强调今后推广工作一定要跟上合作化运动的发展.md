Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives jointly convened the National New-Style Animal-Powered Farm Implements Work Conference from July 16th to 31st. During the conference, Deng Zihui, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, gave important instructions on future farm implement work. Soviet expert Trusov provided valuable opinions on the design, manufacture, and sales of farm implements.

The conference summarized the work of new-style animal-powered farm implements over the past four years and concluded that the achievements were significant. The promotion of new-style animal-powered farm implements, except for northern Xinjiang, which has a history of more than ten years, mostly started in 1950. By now, it has been extended to twenty-three provinces, seven cities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. According to statistics, by the end of 1953, more than 690,000 pieces of various new-style animal-powered farm implements had been promoted, including more than 510,000 pieces of various new-style walking plows, more than 30,000 pieces of cultivators, harrows, rollers, seeders, and harvesters, and more than 150,000 pieces of other farm implements such as rice threshers and corn shellers. Agricultural technology promotion stations in Northeast China, mainly promoting new-style animal-powered farm implements, have developed to 664 locations. Fifty-four new-style animal-powered farm implement stations have been established successively in North China, Northwest China (excluding Xinjiang), East China, and Central South China. Various regions have also trained and cultivated a large number of technical cadres and new-style animal-powered farm implement technicians.

The promotion of these new-style animal-powered farm implements has played a significant role in promoting the improvement of cultivation techniques, increasing grain and cotton production, promoting the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, saving manpower and animal power for land processing or expanding production, and further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. In many areas of Northeast China, farmers can generally increase production by about 25% compared to farming with old-style farm implements by using new-style animal-powered farm implements to achieve deep plowing, flat sowing, close planting, and timely harvesting. In 1951, a comparative experiment of eleven crops in nine provinces and cities, including Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Shandong, Henan, and Beijing, showed that under the same cultivation conditions, new-style walking plows can increase production by an average of 16% and improve efficiency by about 36% compared to old plows because they can plow deeper, have a flat plow bottom, and are easier to pull. The double-wheeled double-furrow plow is now the most popular among farmers. According to experiments in Shanxi Province, a double-wheeled double-furrow plow can plow an average of 9 to 12 mu of land per day with one person and two to three animals, increasing work efficiency by 60% to 150% compared to old plows, and the cultivation quality is better. Most of these new-style animal-powered farm implements are purchased and used by mutual aid and cooperative organizations. A survey in the Northeast region last year showed that all sets of new-style animal-powered farm implements were used by organized farmers. Many mutual aid and cooperative organizations and individual farmers in various regions who have not yet used new-style animal-powered farm implements have seen the benefits of using them and have requested to expand their organizations, connect the land into pieces, actively organize and participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and prepare to use new-style animal-powered farm implements. Because new-style animal-powered farm implements reduce labor, they also attract a large number of rural women to participate in agricultural production. Through the promotion of new-style animal-powered farm implements, farmers have deeply realized the important role of industrial support for agriculture, and farmers have expressed their willingness to produce more grain to support national industrial construction.

The conference also pointed out the shortcomings in the past work of new-style animal-powered farm implements. The main shortcomings are that many regions, after seeing that farmers welcomed new farm implements after typical demonstrations, blindly formulated large plans, designed them poorly, and even manufactured them crudely, with inconsistent prices, and failed to teach farmers how to use them or organize repair work during the promotion process. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the conference conducted a detailed study of the manufacturing, promotion, price, and repair of new-style animal-powered farm implements and found many ways to improve them. The conference pointed out that future promotion work should continue to implement the policy of focusing on demonstration and actively and steadily promoting them.

According to the development of agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the conference decided that the promotion of new-style animal-powered farm implements in the future should focus on plows, especially double-wheeled double-furrow plows and double-wheeled single-furrow plows. The plan is to promote 1.3 million pieces of double-wheeled double-furrow plows and double-wheeled single-furrow plows in the plains north of the Huai River before the spring plowing in 1957, so that agricultural production cooperatives in these areas that are suitable can use new-style plows to cultivate land. The mountain plows created in the Northwest region and the paddy field plows created in Guangxi Province have been initially successful after testing and should be steadily promoted in mountainous and rice-growing areas. Other farm implements can be promoted accordingly in various regions according to different situations.

The conference particularly emphasized: the promotion of new-style animal-powered farm implements has now become the primary task for developing agricultural production, consolidating mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and promoting cooperativization. Future promotion work must keep up with the development of the cooperative movement and cannot fall behind. In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of this work, the conference requested that agricultural departments in various regions closely rely on the leadership of local Party and government leading organs, strengthen cooperation with industrial departments, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other relevant departments, and that each province should establish a special agency for agricultural machinery work, and the special commissioner's offices and county people's governments should have dedicated personnel responsible for training professional cadres and new-style animal-powered farm implement technicians.

In addition, the conference also paid attention to the work of old-style farm implements, believing that currently, the number of farmers using new-style animal-powered farm implements is still not large in the country as a whole, and this work still needs to be strengthened, and the principle of "local materials, local manufacturing, and local supply" should continue to be implemented.

    中央农业部等部门联合召开专门会议
    决定积极稳步推广新式畜力农具
    强调今后推广工作一定要跟上合作化运动的发展
    【新华社二日讯】中央人民政府农业部和中央人民政府第一机械工业部、中华全国供销合作总社在七月十六日到三十一日联合召开了全国新式畜力农具工作会议。会议期间，中共中央农村工作部部长、中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会副主任邓子恢对今后农具工作作了重要指示，苏联专家特鲁索夫就关于农具的设计制造和销售等问题提供了很多宝贵意见。
    会议总结了四年来新式畜力农具工作，认为成绩是很大的。新式畜力农具的推广，除新疆北部已有十多年历史外，其他地区大都是从一九五○年开始的，到目前止，已推广到二十三个省、七个市和内蒙古自治区，据统计，到一九五三年底共推广各种新式畜力农具六十九万多件，其中各种新式步犁占五十一万多件，中耕器、耙类、镇压器、播种机、收割机等三万多件，其他农具如打稻机、玉米脱粒机等十五万多件。东北地区的以推广新式畜力农具为主的农业技术推广站已发展到六百六十四处，华北、西北（未包括新疆）、华东、中南等地区先后建立了五十四个新式畜力农具站。各地还训练和培养了大批技术干部和新式畜力农具技术手。
    这些新式畜力农具的推广，对推动耕作技术的改进、增产粮食棉花、促进互助合作运动的发展，节省人工畜力进行土地加工或扩大生产、进一步巩固工农联盟等方面都起了很大作用。东北许多地区农民由于使用新式畜力农具，做到深耕、平播、密植、及时收割，一般可比用旧式农具耕作增加产量百分之二十五左右。一九五一年山西、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、山东、河南、北京市等九个省、市分别以十一种作物对比试验结果，在同样耕作条件下，新式步犁因能深耕、犁底平、拉着轻，比旧犁平均增产百分之十六，提高效率百分之三十六左右。现在双轮双铧犁最受农民欢迎，据山西省试验证明：双轮双铧犁用一个人、二至三头牲口，平均每天耕地九至十二亩，比旧犁提高工作效率百分之六十到百分之一百五十，耕作质量较好。这些新式畜力农具绝大部分都是互助合作组织购置使用的，东北区去年调查，使用整套新式畜力农具全部是组织起来的农民。各地许多现在还未使用新式畜力农具的互助合作组织和单干农民，看到使用新式畜力农具的好处后，都要求扩大组织，把土地连成片，积极组织和参加互助合作组织，准备使用新式畜力农具。因为新式畜力农具减轻了劳动，还吸收了广大农村妇女参加到农业生产中来。通过新式畜力农具的推广，农民深刻认识到工业支援农业的重要作用，农民都表示要多打粮食支援国家工业建设。
    会议也指出了过去新式畜力农具工作中的缺点。主要缺点是很多地区在典型示范后看到农民欢迎新式农具，就盲目制订大计划，设计不周，甚至粗制滥造，价格不统一，推广中没有教会农民使用，没有组织好修理工作。为了克服这些缺点，会议对新式畜力农具的制造、推广、价格、修理等问题作了详细的研究，并找出了许多改进的办法；会议指出，今后推广工作仍应继续贯彻重点示范、积极稳步推广的方针。
    根据农业生产和互助合作运动的发展情况，会议确定今后推广新式畜力农具以犁为主，尤其是双轮双铧犁、双轮一铧犁。计划在一九五七年春耕前，以淮河以北平原地区为重点，推广双轮双铧犁、双轮一铧犁一百三十万件，使这些地区的农业生产合作社凡条件适合的都能用新式犁耕地。西北区创造的山地犁和广西省创造的水田犁经过试验，初步成功，应在山区和水稻区稳步推广。其他农具，各地可根据不同情况相应地推广。
    会议特别强调指出：推广新式畜力农具，目前已成为发展农业生产、巩固互助合作组织、推动合作化的首要任务，今后推广工作一定要跟上合作化运动的发展，不能落在后面。为了加强对这一工作的组织领导，会议要求各地农业部门紧紧依靠当地党、政领导机关的领导，加强和工业部门、供销合作社等有关部门协作，各省并应建立农业机具工作的专门机构，专署和县人民政府应有专人负责，训练好专业干部和新式畜力农具技术手。
    此外，会议还注意了旧式农具工作，认为目前在全国来说，使用新式畜力农具的农民究竟还不多，这一工作仍需加强领导，继续贯彻“就地取材、就地制造、就地供应”的原则。
