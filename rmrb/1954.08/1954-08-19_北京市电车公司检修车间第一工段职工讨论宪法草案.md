Employees of the First Workshop of the Beijing Electric Tram Company Discuss the Draft Constitution
    He Zuo
    At 5:20 PM on July 29th, before the hour hand reached 5:30, the employees of the First Workshop of the Beijing Electric Tram Company's repair shop had already gathered in the open space in front of the repair shop's office, waiting for the meeting to begin. Usually, when meetings were held, everyone would chat until the meeting started, and the young workers would always joke and laugh. But today was different. Everyone held a copy of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China in their hands, some holding copies of "China Youth" and "Study" magazines containing the draft constitution. They went to the meeting place and sat quietly on the small stools they had brought, reading their books. They were going to discuss the draft constitution today, and everyone was concentrating on preparing their opinions.
    When the time came, Guan Junxia, the Party Branch Secretary of the repair shop, walked into the crowd and said: "Our study of the draft constitution has been going on since June 17th and has now come to an end. We've had four or five discussions. But those discussions mainly focused on understanding the basic content and spirit of the draft constitution, as well as the significance of drafting the constitution. Today we will begin discussing it line by line and clause by clause, and we must seriously put forward suggestions for revising the draft constitution."
    The young worker Liu Zhiguang spoke first, looking at the draft constitution in his hand, he said: "Since the beginning of the study, I've been thinking about it every day, and I read it whenever I have time. I've thought it over, and the paragraph in the preamble of the draft constitution is exactly what I want, and I completely agree with it. But I have one thought: I think we workers are the leading class today, we must be the masters of our own house, and the draft constitution is our weapon to be the masters of our own house. We must study it thoroughly so that we can master it and build a socialist society; otherwise, we will not be able to manage this house well." Repair worker Bao Wenkai said: "I completely agree with Liu Zhiguang's opinion. It's really not easy for us workers to be the masters of our own house today. Thinking back to the past, workers were really inferior to a rich man's dog. I worked in the electric tram company before liberation. One year I got typhoid fever and was very sick. I didn't have money to treat it, and I sold all the things in my house, but I still couldn't afford to see a doctor. No one cared back then!" At this point, Bao Wenkai was so excited that he couldn't continue. A worker next to him said: "When we talk about our past lives, we don't know how much we suffered. Look at now, when we get sick, we are immediately sent to the hospital. Now and in the past are simply worlds apart. We must work hard to consolidate this victory." Car fitter Cao Changshan said: "In the old society, we workers simply couldn't study culture; now we all have the opportunity to study culture, which shows that our country has also achieved new victories in culture." Then everyone put forward some suggestions for revising the preamble of the draft constitution.
    When discussing Article 1 of the General Program, everyone's emotions were somewhat excited. Article 1 of the General Program stipulates that the working class is the leading class of the state. The workers deeply felt the great significance of this sentence. Yang Yuchun said: "I have been working since I was a teenager. During the Japanese imperialist rule, I worked for them like a beast of burden. When a worker got sick, he was dragged out and buried before he died." At this point, he couldn't continue. After a while, he calmed down and said: "Now, our working class is the leading class of the state. But I myself have many shortcomings. In the future, I must correct my shortcomings such as losing my temper, work hard, and strive to complete the tasks assigned to me by the state." The young worker Liu Zhiguang added for Yang Yuchun: "During the period of Japanese rule, he was arrested and taken to a coal mine to dig coal. Most of the Chinese workers who were arrested died there. That kind of suffering, that old master has suffered before Liberation! What he said is exactly what we all want to say." Wang Xuelian continued: "Why should our working class lead? Because the working class is the most organized, the most disciplined, and the most conscious advanced class. We must unite with the peasant class to build our country together. We ourselves must first better complete the tasks assigned to us by the state."
    Master Sun Yugui had wanted to speak for a long time. He said: "Wait a moment, let me talk first. I am already sixty-eight years old this year, and I have never seen our workers being able to discuss the fundamental law of the country. In the second year of the 'Republic of China', I was an apprentice in a private factory. One morning, the shopkeeper gave everyone raw steamed buns to eat. Everyone couldn't eat them, so we went to the shopkeeper and asked him to give us some money to buy some pancakes to eat. The shopkeeper said: What? You still want to buy pancakes to eat? Just make do with it, and eat cooked ones at noon. I protested: If the shopkeeper can give us raw steamed buns to eat, can we not do a good job? The shopkeeper's face turned and said: If you don't want to do it, get out of here. There are plenty of people who want to do this job. Thinking back to what kind of life we workers lived at that time, now we are the masters of our own house, Chairman Mao has brought us happiness, and I have caught up with it in my old age. In 1951, I went to Beidaihe for recuperation and stayed for half a month, and my weight increased by eight kilograms; I also receive an on-the-job old-age subsidy equivalent to 20% of my salary every month. Now we are so good, I want to work hard, support the draft constitution, and support Chairman Mao."
    Deng Faxi, the repair class leader and Communist Party member sitting on the east side, continued in a loud voice: "I have read the first three articles of the General Program of the draft constitution, and after listening to everyone's speech, my heart is about to jump out. Thinking back to before liberation, what power did we workers have? Now workers can freely go to the office to raise opinions to the leaders. Before, no one dared to go. If you went, you would stand straight outside the door, not knowing which sentence was wrong, and the job would be gone. Everyone can still remember that during the period of enemy and puppet rule, there was a Master Han who, one time because of a stomach ache, lay down on the tram for a while. He was seen by Gao Zaitian, the puppet chairman, who insisted that he was lazy, and no one could intercede for him. He was dismissed from his job at that time..." Master Deng also talked about his eldest son and second son, and also talked about how he could only get a worn-out uniform after working in the factory for eight years, and now new workers can get brand-new uniforms in a few days... Master Deng's words expressed the common feelings of the workers who hated the old society and loved the new society. Everyone knew that Deng Faxi had worked in the factory very early, and he had suffered more than anyone else in the past. His eldest son didn't finish the fourth grade of elementary school because he couldn't afford it; his second son got sick when he was six years old, but because he didn't have money, the hospital wouldn't treat him. Later, he really couldn't afford to raise him, and wanted to give his second son away, but who would want him? Someone suggested that he send him to an orphanage, but how could he be willing to send his own son to hell? It was really difficult! Now? Deng Faxi said: "Now my eldest child is twenty-five years old and works in the purchasing department of the electric tram company. My two younger sons and daughter are all in school, and now our family's life is not a problem." At this point, he paused slightly and said: "Now the draft constitution stipulates that our working class is the leading class of the state, and all power of the state belongs to the people. I have a suggestion, these articles must not be changed."
    The young worker Liu Zhiguang continued to speak, he said: "Let me talk to you about my feelings about Article 3 of the General Program of the draft constitution. I am a Tibetan, born in Beijing. Although I am young, I have also suffered a lot from the oppression and discrimination of ethnic minorities during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. When the Kuomintang reactionaries were in power, we didn't dare to tell people that we were Tibetans; originally, the customs and habits of each ethnic group are different, but the Kuomintang didn't allow us to hold our own religious ceremonies; if the puppet police saw several Tibetans talking together, they would definitely call them to interrogate them. If we spoke Tibetan together, the crime would be even greater. Now the draft constitution stipulates that all ethnic groups are equal. It also prohibits discrimination and oppression against any ethnic group. All ethnic groups have the freedom to develop their own spoken and written languages, and have the freedom to maintain and reform their own customs and habits and religious beliefs. The state often sends people to understand what difficulties we have in our lives, and tries to help us solve them. Now our Tibetan people can also hold meetings together with the doors open and talk freely. I now dare to tell people that I am a Tibetan." From the happy expression on the face of this young Tibetan worker, one could see the joy in his heart of living in an equal, free, and happy national family.
    The sky gradually darkened, and the discussion was still going on enthusiastically.
    Wang Zhixin, the maintenance class leader and old worker, pointed to Article 2 of the General Program of the draft constitution and said excitedly: "Today, our draft constitution first stipulates that 'All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people.' What a democratic country! When the Kuomintang ruled, I worked in the electric tram company, and the factory sternly said to us workers: 'I can let you live, and I can cure you to death.' At that time, they scolded the workers as 'smelly workers'. The workers didn't even have the right to speak, unlike now! Now the working class is the master of the house, and the state wants the people to elect their own representatives to do things for the people. How democratic this is!"
    The young car electrician Liu Benqiang said: "Although I am young and have not experienced much, I have also heard a lot of things. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries only cared about their own enjoyment and didn't care about the people's affairs at all. Today, the Communist Party leads us and first does great things for our people. The fundamental law formulated by the state is also first brought to the people for discussion."
    A tram rumbled into the factory, and the electric lights in the room also lit up, making the atmosphere of the discussion even more tense and enthusiastic. Car electrician Hua Jinduo said: "I feel that what is mentioned in Article 10 of the draft constitution about the state transforming capitalist industry and commerce should be 'supervised by the masses of workers' is not enough. Should it be said more broadly, changing 'workers' to 'people'?" Before he finished speaking, the young worker Yang Yuchun said loudly: "No, I disagree. Here it must be specified as 'workers'. Capitalists are also people, but can they supervise themselves?" The young worker Wei Xiangren also continued: "This place cannot be changed, it must be said that it is 'supervised by the masses of workers'."
    When discussing Article 13, "The state may, in the public interest, purchase, requisition, or nationalize urban and rural land and other means of production in accordance with the conditions prescribed by law," Deng Faxi, the old leader of the repair class, said: "I read this article and think it is very good. In fact, when the state needs civilian houses or land for public purposes, it provides very generous material assistance. The state has already requisitioned my house for public purposes. When it was requisitioned, I didn't have to worry about anything. The state even took care of the relocation, and even a jujube tree in the yard was priced!"
    Liu Fenglin also continued: "Master Deng's words are correct. Today, our country is completely different from the past. In the past, when the Kuomintang reactionaries wanted to requisition civilian houses, they didn't care if you had a place to live! They would immediately let you move out."
    After their speeches, there were still many people who wanted to speak, but it was already 8:00 PM, and many workers still had to work the night shift. When Chairman Liu Fenglin announced the adjournment of the meeting, he also asked everyone to prepare more opinions before the next discussion.

    北京市电车公司检修车间第一工段职工讨论宪法草案
    何作
    七月二十九日下午，时针还没有到五时三十分，北京市电车公司检修车间第一工段的职工，已经聚集在检修车间办公室门前空地上，等候开会。平时开会，大伙一到会场，看见时间不到，就聊起天来，青年工人总是打打闹闹，说说笑笑。可是今天不同了，今天每个人手里都拿着一本中华人民共和国宪法草案，有的拿着登载着宪法草案的中国青年、学习杂志，他们走到会场，就坐在自己随身带来的小凳子上，静静地看起书来。他们今天要讨论宪法草案，大家都集中注意力在准备意见。
    时间到了，检修车间党支部书记关俊侠走到人丛中间说：从六月十七日开始到目前，我们的宪法草案学习已经告一段落，讨论过四、五次。但那几次讨论，主要是了解宪法草案的基本内容和精神，以及制定宪法的意义。今天我们开始逐条逐句讨论，要对宪法草案认真地提出修改意见。
    青年工人刘志广第一个发言，他看着自己手里拿着的宪法草案说：“从开始学习起，我就天天想，有工夫就看，我已琢磨过，宪法草案序言里那一段都合我的心愿，我完全同意。不过我有一点感想，我觉得我们工人今天是领导阶级，我们要当家作主，宪法草案就是我们当家作主的武器，我们要学习透澈，才能掌握它建设社会主义社会；要不然，我们就当不好这个家。”检修工人保文凯说：“我完全同意刘志广的意见。我们工人阶级今天能当家作主，可真不容易。想起过去，工人真不如有钱人家的一只狗。解放前我就在电车公司干活，有一年我得了伤寒病，病得很厉害，没有钱治病，把家里的东西都卖光了，也看不起病。那时候谁管！”说到这里，保文凯激动得说不下去了。在他身边的一个工人说：“提起我们过去的生活，我们不知受了多少罪。看看现在，我们有了病马上就送到医院去。现在和过去简直是天上地下。我们一定要好好干，来巩固这个胜利果实。”车钳工人曹常山说：“在旧社会，我们当工人的根本不能够学习文化；现在我们都有机会学习文化了，这说明我们国家在文化上也取得了新的胜利。”接着大家对宪法草案序言部分提出了一些修改意见。
    讨论总纲第一条的时候，大家的情绪都有些激动。总纲第一条首先规定了工人阶级是国家的领导阶级。工人们深深体会到这句话所包括的重大意义。杨玉春说：“我从十几岁就做工。在日本帝国主义统治的时候，像牛马一样的给他们干活，工人有了病，没等死就拉出去埋了。”说到这里，他说不下去了。停了一会，他才平静下来说：“现在，我们工人阶级是国家的领导阶级了。可是我自己却存在着很多缺点，今后我一定要改正耍脾气等等缺点，好好干活，努力完成国家交给我的任务。”青年工人刘志广替杨玉春补充说：“过去日本统治的时期，他被抓到煤窑里去挖煤，被抓去的华工大多数都死在那儿了。这样的苦处，解放前那位老师傅都受过！他说的话也正是我们大家要说的话。”王学廉接着说：“为什么让我们工人阶级领导哪？因为工人阶级是最有组织、最有纪律、最有觉悟的先进的阶级。我们要和农民阶级联合起来共同建设我们的国家。我们自己首先要更好地完成国家交给我们的任务。”
    孙玉贵老师傅早想说话了，他说：“你们等会，我先谈谈。我今年已经六十八岁了，没有见过我们工人还能讨论国家大法。‘民国’二年，我在一家私营工厂里当学徒，有一天早晨，掌柜的给大伙吃生馒头，大伙不能吃，我们就去找掌柜的，要求掌柜的给一点钱买点烙饼吃。掌柜的说：什么？还想买饼吃，就那么将就点吧，等中午吃熟的。我强了一句嘴：掌柜的能给我们吃生馒头，我们做活做不好行吗？掌柜的脸一翻说：不干给我滚蛋，这种活儿有的是人要干。想起来那时我们工人过的是什么生活，现在我们当家作主了，毛主席给我们带来了幸福，我老来赶上了。一九五一年我到北戴河休养，住了半个月，体重增加了八公斤；我每月还领相当于我工资的百分之二十的在职养老补助费。现在我们太好了，我要好好干活，拥护宪法草案，拥护毛主席。”
    坐在东面的检修班班长、共产党员邓发熙老师傅用宏亮的声音接着说：“我看了宪法草案总纲头三条，又听了大家的发言，我的心都要蹦起来了。回想起解放以前我们工人那有什么权力，这会儿工人可以随便上公事房向领导上提意见，以前谁也不敢去，去了都在门外站个笔直，不知那句话说得不对碴儿，这个饭碗可就砸了。大家还能记得敌伪统治的时候，有个韩师傅，有一次因为肚子疼在电车上躺一会儿，给伪董事长高在天看见了，硬说他偷懒，谁说情也不行，当时就把差事给撤了。……”邓老师傅又讲到他的大儿子和二儿子，又讲到过去在工厂干了八年才能拿到一件破制服，现在新来的工人没几天就可以领到崭新的制服……。邓老师傅的话表达了工人们痛恨旧社会和热爱新社会的共同心情。大家都知道邓发熙很早就在厂里工作，他过去受的苦比谁都多，大儿子小学四年没念完就念不起了；二儿子六岁的时候病了，因为没有钱，医院不给治，后来实在养活不起，想把二儿子送人，可是谁肯要呢？有人给他出主意，送给孤儿院，可是他怎么舍得把自己的亲生儿子往地狱里送呢，真是为难呀！现在呢？邓发熙说：“现在我的大孩子二十五岁了，在电车公司购料科工作。我的两个小儿子和女儿都在上学，现在我们一家人生活不成问题。”说到这里，他略微停一停又说：“现在宪法草案规定了我们工人阶级是国家的领导阶级，国家的一切权力属于人民，我提个意见，这几条说什么也不能改。”
    青年工人刘志广接着发言，他说：“我来和大家谈两句我对宪法草案总纲第三条的感想。我是藏族人，生在北京，虽然我年岁还轻，可是在国民党反动派统治时期，少数民族受压迫、受歧视的苦头也吃了不少。国民党反动派在的时候，我们对人不敢说自己是藏族人；本来各民族的风俗习惯不一样，可是国民党不准我们举行自己的宗教仪式；伪警察要是看见几个藏族人在一起说话，一定要叫去盘问盘问。如果我们在一起说藏族话，那罪过可就更大啦。现在宪法草案中规定了各民族一律平等。还禁止对任何民族的歧视和压迫。各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由，都有保持和改革自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰的自由。国家经常派人来了解我们生活上有什么困难，并且设法帮助我们解决，现在我们藏族人民在一起开会也可以开着大门亮开嗓子随便谈了。我现在也敢对人说我是藏族人了。”从这个青年藏族工人脸上愉快的表情中，可以看出他那生活在平等、自由和幸福的民族大家庭中的内心的喜悦。
    天色逐渐黑了下来，讨论会仍在热烈地进行。
    维修班班长、老工人王芝新指着宪法草案总纲第二条激动地说：“今天咱们的宪法草案里，首先就规定着‘中华人民共和国一切权力属于人民’，这是多么民主的国家啊！在国民党统治时，我在电车公司里做工，厂方凶恶地对我们工人说：‘我能让你们活，就能治你们死。’那时候他们骂工人是‘臭工人’。工人那时连说话的权利都没有，那像现在似的呢！现在工人阶级当家作主，国家要人民自己选举出代表来给人民办事，这是多么民主啊！”
    年青的车电工刘本强说：“我年纪虽小，经历的不多，可是我也听说过不少的事情。过去国民党反动派只顾自己的享受，人民的事根本不管，今天共产党领导咱们，首先就替咱们人民办大事。国家制定的大法，也首先拿来让人民讨论。”
    一辆电车隆隆地向厂里驶进来，屋子里的电灯也亮起来，讨论会的情绪显得更紧张热烈起来。车电工滑金铎发言说：“我对宪法草案中第十条谈到的国家改造资本主义工商业要受‘工人群众的监督’这点，感到还不够，是不是还应该说得更广些，将‘工人’改为‘人民’？”他的话还没说完，青年工人杨玉春大声说：“不，我不同意，这里一定要指明是‘工人’，资本家也是人民，可是他们自己监督自己行吗？”青年工人魏相仁也接着说：“这地方不能改，一定要说是受‘工人群众的监督’。”
    讨论到第十三条“国家为了公共利益的需要，可以按照法律规定的条件，对城乡土地和其他生产资料实行征购、征用或者收归国有”时，检修班老班长邓发熙说：“我看了这条，觉得很好。实际上国家因公需要民房或土地时，是给了很优厚的物质帮助的。我家的房子国家因公需要已经征用了，征用时，没有让我操一点心，国家连搬家的事都管了，就是院子里的一棵枣树也都给作了价呢！”
    刘凤林也接下去说：“老邓师傅的话对，今天咱们国家就是跟过去完全不同了，过去国民党反动派要征用民房，他管你有处住没有呢！立刻就让你搬走。”
    他们发言以后，还有许多人要发言，可是时间已经是晚八点钟了，许多工人还要上夜班。主席刘凤林在宣布散会时，并要求大家在下次讨论前更多地准备意见。
