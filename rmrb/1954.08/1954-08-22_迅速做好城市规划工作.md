    Swiftly Complete Urban Planning Work
    With the development of national economic construction, a number of new industrial areas will appear in our country. Whether these new industrial areas are expanded based on old cities or are completely newly built, they must be based on correct urban planning. Therefore, in order to cooperate with the construction of new industrial areas, urban planning work must be completed quickly.
    At present, a large number of newly built industrial enterprises have completed the selection of factory sites, the preliminary design of factories has been completed one after another, various off-site projects are about to begin, and staff and worker residential areas are in urgent need of architectural design. If urban planning is not done well, and the location of residential construction, the layout of neighborhoods, and the distribution of public life and welfare facilities cannot be determined early, confusion will occur in the design of off-site projects and residential areas. For example, the construction of roads needs to be completed before the construction of factories and residential areas. If the urban plan is not determined, the direction, width, and slope of the roads cannot be determined. Blind construction may cause rework and waste; delaying construction will cause difficulties for enterprise construction. Another example is the distribution of various pipeline projects such as water supply, drainage, power supply, and heating, and the distance between the upper, lower, left, and right sides must also be uniformly and rationally arranged in advance, otherwise mutual interference will occur. In the past, some cities lacked unified planning and blindly carried out various constructions, which caused many problems, such as scattered housing construction, repetitive waste of public life and welfare facilities, failure to coordinate public utilities, and chaotic construction, resulting in unreasonable and inconvenient industrial production and employee life, and wasting national funds. These problems must be avoided in future work.
    Since accelerating the planning of cities and new industrial areas is an extremely important task in the current industrial capital construction, the following issues must be given timely attention in order to do this work well.
    During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, most of the new industrial areas in our country were built on the basis of old cities. Therefore, when we carry out the planning of new industrial areas, that is, the planning of urban construction, we must fully consider how to rationally utilize the foundation of the old cities, and we must consider how to combine the construction of the new industrial areas with the transformation of the old cities. This mainly includes two aspects: one is the employment and re-employment of the existing labor force in the old city, and the other is the utilization of the original material basis of the old city, such as existing factories, residences, and various public life and welfare facilities. At present, some comrades often ignore these factors when considering the development scale of the city. They have not or rarely considered absorbing more of the original consumer population, semi-unemployed population, and female household labor in the old city to participate in industrial construction; they believe that all or most of the employees needed for the expansion or new construction of enterprises can only be transferred from other places. This will inevitably overestimate the population of the city, inappropriately increase the state's investment in employee housing and various public life and welfare facilities, bring some difficulties to the construction of new industrial areas, and prevent the original consumer population of the old city from being employed and re-employed in a timely manner. Therefore, when studying the development scale of new industrial areas, we must realistically investigate and analyze the composition of the existing population of the city, consider the possibility of absorbing the original labor force of the city, and give full play to the potential of the old city as much as possible, and closely integrate the construction of the new industrial areas with the transformation of the old cities. We must oppose the unrealistic ideas and practices of overestimating the population growth rate and blindly engaging in "big cities". All factory construction units should improve the utilization rate of the original cities as much as possible when carrying out industrial capital construction or production. Except for some particularly necessary technical personnel, staff, and skilled workers who rely on transfers from other places, as much of the original labor force in the city should be absorbed as possible, and the city's existing housing and various public life and welfare facilities should be utilized. This will not only reduce the state's investment and accelerate the transformation process of the old cities, and quickly transform consumer cities into productive cities, but it will also be beneficial to the construction of industrial enterprises.
    According to the principles of socialist urban construction and our country's economic conditions, rationally allocating residential land and creating good conditions for the work and life of the working people in industrial areas is also a problem that should be paid attention to in urban planning. In order to strive for the rational arrangement of residential land, it is currently necessary to formulate practical and feasible residential quotas based on our country's economic conditions, social living standards, and the specific conditions of different cities, such as stipulating how much residential building land per person in a certain period, and so on. This is closely related to the rational construction of residential areas, the living conditions of the working people, and the state's investment. At present, there are two deviations in urban planning work: one is to deviate from the specific conditions of our country, raise the quotas too high, inappropriately increase the cost of urban construction, and cause the planning to be divorced from reality; the other is to ignore the long-term development of the city and the possibility of gradually improving the living standards of the working people in our country, and not consider future construction land at all, which will cause difficulties for future development. Both of these deviations must be prevented.
    At present, many cities are carrying out or are about to carry out large-scale housing construction and public utility construction. These cities should pay attention to grasping the policy of focusing on key construction and compact development from the beginning of construction, strengthen the integrity, and oppose dispersion. Urban housing or public buildings should be built in a focused and organized manner, concentrating construction from the inside to the outside, from near to far, developing piece by piece and district by district, so as to gradually form a number of blocks and streets. Public utilities should also be concentrated in coordination with the construction of factories and residences, avoiding the scattered phenomenon of "blooming everywhere", so as to save urban land, save urban construction costs and operating management costs. Public buildings in residential areas, such as boiler rooms, shops, cooperatives, clubs, auditoriums, primary and secondary schools, nurseries, bathhouses, etc., should be arranged uniformly and constructed in a planned manner by the relevant units in each city, so as to avoid each unit doing its own thing and wasting state funds. In cities with the conditions, for the housing construction of different construction units in residential areas, efforts should be made to have a design department uniformly design, so that the housing design can be unified with the requirements of urban planning, and it is also easy to coordinate in architectural art. Even if it is not yet possible to completely achieve uniform design by a design department, the relevant design units should jointly design and make necessary control over the overall layout, so that the layout of residences and public buildings tends to be rational and the architectural forms are coordinated. For this reason, all construction units must strengthen the spirit of mutual cooperation and the overall concept, and the city's leading organs should strengthen planning work and organizational work, and must oppose departmentalism, decentralism, and laissez-faire.
    To carry out the construction of new industrial areas, a part of the farmers' land will be requisitioned. When dealing with land use, we must ensure the land necessary for industrial construction according to the actual needs of national construction; at the same time, we should take care of the current interests of the local people and make proper arrangements for the production and life of those whose land has been requisitioned. On the one hand, we must publicize to the peasants the glorious responsibility of the peasants in the process of national socialist industrialization, explain the necessity of ensuring land for industrial construction, and make the peasants consciously transfer their land with compensation; on the other hand, the construction unit should be very concerned about the interests of the peasants, do a good job in investigation and research, accurately calculate the construction land, pay attention to the rational use of land, and prevent the phenomenon of asking for more and using less. For the requisitioned land, compensation should be given at a fair and reasonable price, and the relevant urban departments should be coordinated to solve the problems of relocation and employment of farmers. For the reserved land for the future development of enterprises, farmers should continue to cultivate it under the condition that it does not hinder the construction purpose, so as to avoid land waste, which is not conducive to agricultural production and increases the difficulty of farmers' re-employment and employment. In short, this is a very meticulous work and a major problem in the construction of new industrial cities. Properly solving this problem is of great significance not only to industrial development and urban construction, but also to consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.
    At present, the planning work of various new industrial areas generally lags behind the needs of industrial construction due to the lack of technical strength and insufficient experience. If it is not strengthened quickly, it will inevitably affect the progress of industrial construction. In order to change the serious backwardness of urban planning work, party committees at all levels and relevant departments must quickly transfer a group of cadres and architectural designers within the scope of the major regions or provinces and cities to strengthen this work. The old large cities have a better foundation and stronger strength, and from the perspective of overall interests, they should also transfer a group of technical forces to support these new industrial cities. Under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, and with the joint and concerted efforts of all parties, we believe that this task can be completed on schedule and can be done well.

    迅速做好城市规划工作
    随着国家经济建设的发展，我国将出现若干个新的工业区。这些新工业区无论是依靠旧城市扩建的，或是完全新建的，都必须以正确的城市规划为基础。因此，为了配合新工业区的建设，必须迅速做好城市规划工作。
    目前已有一大批新建工业企业完成了厂址选择工作，工厂的初步设计已陆续完成，各种厂外工程即将开始，职工住宅区也急待进行建筑设计。如果不作好城市规划，对住宅建设的地点、街坊的布置、公共生活福利设施的分布等不能及早确定，厂外工程设计和住宅区的设计就会发生混乱现象。例如道路的修筑，需要在工厂和住宅区施工之前完成，如果城市规划不定，道路的走向、宽度及坡度就无法确定；盲目修建可能造成返工浪费；拖迟建设又会给企业建设造成困难。又如供水、排水、供电、供热等各种管线工程的分布，上下左右相互间的距离，也必须预先作统一的合理的安排，否则就会发生相互干扰的现象。过去有些城市因为缺乏统一的规划，盲目进行各项建设，曾经发生过很多弊病，例如房屋建设分散、公共生活福利设施重复浪费、公用事业配合不上、建筑混乱等等，以致造成了工业生产和职工生活的不合理和不方便，并且浪费了国家的资金。这些毛病，必须在今后工作中极力避免。
    加紧城市和新工业区的规划工作，既然是目前工业基本建设中一项极为重要的任务；那末，要做好这件工作，下面几个问题必须及时提起注意。
    在第一个五年计划期内，我国大部分的新工业区是依托旧城市的基础建设的。因此我们在进行新工业区的规划也就是城市建设的规划时，必须充分考虑如何合理地利用旧城市的基础，必须考虑新工业区的建设和旧城市的改造如何结合。这主要包括两方面：一方面是旧城市现有劳动力的就业转业问题，另一方面是旧城市原有的物质基础，如现有工厂、住宅及各种公共生活福利设施的利用。现在有些同志在考虑城市的发展规模时往往忽略了这些因素。他们没有或很少考虑更多地吸收旧城市中原有的消费人口、半失业人口和家庭劳动妇女，参加到工业建设上来；对扩建或新建企业所需增加的职工，以为全部或大部都只能是由外地调来的。这就不可避免会过多地估计了城市的人口，不适当地增加了国家对职工住宅及各种公共生活福利设施的投资，给新工业区建设带来某些困难，并使旧城市原有消费人口不能适时地就业和转业。因此，在研究新工业区的发展规模时，必须实事求是地调查分析城市现有人口的组成情况，考虑吸收城市原有劳动力的可能性，尽可能地发挥旧城市的潜在力量，把新工业区的建设与对旧城市的改造密切地结合起来。必须反对那种不切实际的、过高估计人口的增长率，盲目搞“大城市”的思想和做法。各建厂单位在进行工业基本建设或生产时，应尽可能提高原有城市的利用率。除部分特别必需的技术人员、职员及技术工人依靠从外地抽调以外，应尽可能多吸收所在城市的原有劳动力，并利用城市既有的住宅及各种公共生活福利设施。这样不仅可以减少国家的投资，加速旧城市的改造过程，较快地变消费性的城市为生产性的城市，而且对工业企业的建设也是有利的。
    根据社会主义城市建设的原则及我国的经济条件，合理地分配居住用地，为工业区劳动人民的工作和生活创造良好的条件，也是城市规划中应该注意的一个问题。为争取居住用地的合理安排，目前必须根据我国的经济条件、社会生活水平及不同城市的具体情况，拟定实际可行的居住定额，如规定一定时期每人住宅建筑用地多少等等。这对于住宅区的合理建设，劳动人民的生活条件和国家的投资都有密切的关系。目前在城市规划工作中有两种偏向：一种是脱离我国具体条件，把定额提得过高，不适当地增加了城市造价，造成规划与实际脱节；另一种是忽略城市的长远发展和我国劳动人民居住水平逐步提高的可能，毫不考虑今后建设用地，以致造成将来发展的困难。这两种偏向都必须加以防止。
    现在有不少城市正在或即将进行大规模的房屋建筑及公用事业的建设。这些城市应该在建设开始的时候即注意掌握重点建设紧凑发展的方针，加强整体性，反对分散性。城市的住宅或公共建筑，应有重点有组织地集中建设，由内向外，由近到远，一片一片和一区一区地发展，以便逐步形成若干街坊和街道。公用事业也要集中地配合工厂、住宅的建设，避免“到处开花”的分散现象，以节约城市用地，节约城市造价和经营管理费用。在住宅区内的公共建筑，如锅炉房、商店、合作社、俱乐部、礼堂、中小学校、托儿所、澡堂等建筑，应由各城市有关单位作统一的布置，有计划的建设，以免各搞一套，浪费国家资金。在条件具备的城市，对于住宅区内不同建设单位的房屋建筑，应争取由一个设计部门统一设计，以便使房屋设计与城市规划的要求统一起来，在建筑艺术上也易于协调。即使还不可能完全做到由一个设计部门统一设计，也应该由有关的设计单位联合设计，在总平面布置上加以必要的控制，使住宅和公共建筑的布置趋于合理，建筑形式取得协调。为此，各建设单位必须加强互相协作的精神和整体观念，城市的领导机关则应加强规划工作和组织工作，必须反对本位主义、分散主义和放任自流的现象。
    进行新工业区的建设，将要征用一部分农民的土地。在处理用地时，必须根据国家建设的确实需要，保证工业建设所必需的土地；同时又应照顾当地人民的当前利益，对土地被征用者的生产和生活有妥善的安置。一方面要向农民宣传在国家社会主义工业化过程中农民的光荣责任，说明保证工业建设用地的必要性，使农民自觉地把自己的土地有代价地转让出来；另一方面建设单位应十分关怀农民的利益，做好调查研究工作，精确计算建设用地，注意土地的合理使用，防止发生要得多用得少的现象。对于征用的土地，要按照公平合理的代价予以补偿，并应协同城市有关部门解决农民的迁居和就业问题。对于企业将来发展的保留用地，在不妨碍建设用途的条件下，仍应由农民继续耕种，避免造成土地荒废，既不利于农业生产，又增加农民转业和就业的困难。总之，这是一件极细致的工作，是新工业城市建设中的一个重大问题。妥善地解决这个问题，不仅对工业发展和城市建设，而且对巩固工农联盟都有重要的意义。
    目前各个新工业区的规划工作，由于缺乏技术力量和经验不足，一般都落后于工业建设的需要。如不迅速加强，势将影响工业建设的进行。为了改变城市规划工作严重的落后状况，各级党委及有关部门必须急速在大区或省市范围内抽调一批干部及建筑设计人员来加强这项工作。旧的大城市基础较好，力量较强，从整体利益出发，也应抽调一批技术力量来支援这些新工业城市。在各级党委和政府的领导下，在各方面共同一致的努力下，我们相信这个任务是能够争取按期完成并且能够做好的。
