In order to help weak agricultural production cooperatives quickly correct their shortcomings, we held a "Symposium on the Work of Weak Cooperatives" in Suihua County and conducted in-depth investigations in the Wang Zhendong Cooperative and Ma Xiancheng Cooperative (two relatively poor cooperatives) in Xingfu Village, Sixth District. The situation we learned and our opinions on improving weak cooperatives are as follows:

I. The Situation of Weak Cooperatives

There are ten weak cooperatives in Suihua County, accounting for 6.7% of the existing cooperatives. All of them are newly established this year and are mostly located in remote and marginal areas or villages with weak work. These cooperatives basically meet the conditions for establishment and have a certain number of leading cadres; however, for half a year since their establishment, the production of these ten cooperatives has always been backward; their operation and management are very chaotic; the leadership is weak, and the confidence of the members is low.

From the perspective of production: the production of nine out of ten cooperatives is not as good as that of the local mutual aid teams, the progress is slow, and the quality of cultivation is relatively rough. For example, the Wang Zhendong Cooperative in the Sixth District has the same ratio of labor to land as the local mutual aid teams, but the cooperative's production lags behind the mutual aid teams. When the first weeding of the entire village was basically completed, the cooperative still had 32 hectares of land untouched. Later, it was helped by hired labor, so the land was not abandoned; the quality of cultivation was also not as good as that of the better local mutual aid teams or individual farmers. Judging from the current situation, if three of these cooperatives are not improved vigorously and promptly, they will definitely reduce production, and in the autumn, they will harvest less grain than the mutual aid teams (the reason is rough cultivation, many missing seedlings, and untimely mid-cultivation, etc.).

From the perspective of operation and management: eight out of ten cooperatives are relatively chaotic. There is no production plan. For example, in the Wang Zhendong Cooperative, it is not clear to the members and the council how many times the summer weeding requires hoeing and how each crop is required. Everyone has their own opinions. The labor organization is relatively lax, and the labor calculation is unreasonable. Therefore, the attendance rate is very low. In the Ma Xiancheng Cooperative, an average of four or five of the twenty male laborers are idle every day; sometimes more than half are idle. The work points are calculated as "old twelve points," which neither implements fixed quotas with flexible evaluations nor small-scale contracting, which affects the members' enthusiasm for labor.

In terms of financial management, the general problem is that the system is not sound, there is no plan for spending money, and a few cooperatives do not implement the spirit of running the cooperative frugally. The Ma Xiancheng Cooperative is extravagant and wasteful, and has already owed more than 20 million yuan in foreign debt; it spent more than 10 million yuan to buy a rubber-tired cart when the cooperative was established, but now it is "idle," which has tied up funds and also requires paying interest; the accounts of many cooperatives are chaotic, and some cooperatives have not announced their accounts once in half a year. Many members said: "If the accounts of the cooperative are not clear, my heart is confused."

From the perspective of political work: generally, there are few meetings, little education, no competition inside and outside the cooperative, and all meetings are not held on time. The Wang Zhendong Cooperative held only one criticism and self-criticism meeting in more than half a year, and the result was that "the meeting was not held well, and the grudges became even greater."

From the perspective of the members' thinking: the members generally believe that the cooperative "road is good," but they do not believe that their own cooperative can be run well. According to the two weak cooperatives in the Sixth District, only a few members have long-term plans and work actively; most of them hold a wait-and-see attitude, saying "If it's good, we'll do it; if it's not good, we'll disband"; a few members hope that the cooperative will collapse, "It's better to have hail than rain, it's all gone and doesn't need to be hoed," and they encourage others to "hoe roughly" when hoeing, disobeying leadership. Some members, because they sold candied haws during the spring plowing, which affected production, were persuaded to stop, and he said: "The cooperative has 'broken' my 'money string'!" These people often say: "I took a wrong step, I shouldn't have joined the cooperative in the first place." "My hand is stuck in the millstone!" "I won't do anything in the fall." Some say that the cooperative is like a "bamboo fence," making people "unfree." The eleven households in the Wang Mingjiu Cooperative in the Seventh District are divided into three factions. Nominally, poor peasants are the directors, but in reality, wealthy households manipulate the cooperative, control the leadership, and exclude poor households; many tasks in the cooperative cannot be implemented.

II. Reasons for the Formation of Weak Cooperatives

1. The county and district committees (mainly the district committees) lack a comprehensive understanding and in-depth leadership of these cooperatives. When county and district cadres go to the countryside, they are willing to go to advanced cooperatives, but unwilling to go to remote and backward cooperatives; or they simply ask a comrade to be responsible for "taking care of" them, and as a result, these cooperatives are without leadership for a long time. This is the fundamental reason for the formation of weak cooperatives.

2. The work of establishing some cooperatives is rough. For example, the Wang Zhendong Cooperative forcibly "persuaded" three households to join the cooperative; two of them are now causing problems, and the cooperative cadres regret "not forcing them to join in the first place." There are also many outstanding issues that were not resolved when the cooperative was established. Some cooperatives have not even determined how much horse rent is, and the members say that they "don't know what's going on," and it is a "muddled cooperative."

3. The leading cadres of the cooperative lack experience, especially the director is weak in ability, and about half of the weak cooperative councils are not united; these cooperatives are also located in remote areas, far from experienced cooperatives, and when problems arise, they cannot be solved in time; over time, weak cooperatives are formed.

III. How to Improve the Work of Weak Cooperatives

Based on the opinions at the symposium and our experience in working in two backward cooperatives, we should focus on improving the work of weak cooperatives from the following aspects:

1. Use the facts of backward cooperatives and their bad impact on the masses to remind and educate cadres, so that they can face up to the necessity of changing the situation of backward cooperatives, and understand the importance of "only allowing them to be run well, not allowing them to be run badly." At the symposium, everyone believed that if the cooperative is run badly, the result will not only be less grain harvested, but also a very bad impact on the outside of the cooperative, which will greatly hinder the development of the cooperative movement. After the symposium, the members requested that the county and district leaders help with the work. The county party committee plans to convene the district party committees with weak cooperatives again to study and deploy the work of strengthening weak cooperatives; especially for the three cooperatives that will definitely reduce production, it plans to send capable cadres to help them reverse the situation and improve production.

2. The county and district committees should immediately appoint capable cadres to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the work of weak cooperatives. It is necessary to find out the crux of each cooperative and the key to improvement, prescribe the right medicine, and quickly improve. At present, special attention should be paid to helping each cooperative find out the key to increasing production, strive to improve the yield per unit area, and ensure the increase of members' income. For example, the Wang Zhendong Cooperative has no production plan, some advocate that the second summer weeding should not be hoed but harrowed, some advocate hoeing twice, some advocate hanging up the hoe after two times, and some advocate that more hoeing requires hiring labor. Later, a members' meeting was held to tap labor potential, democratically formulate a summer weeding plan, calculate the labor force, working time, and tasks in the cooperative, and determine that without hiring labor, it is also possible to hoe and harrow the stubble land twice each, and hoe and harrow the weeds three times each. At the same time, a ten-day full attendance reward system was also established. After doing this, the labor attendance rate has increased, and the members are also satisfied.

3. Strengthen ideological education for the backbone and masses of weak cooperatives. (1) Conduct socialist education to strengthen the members' confidence in running the cooperative; (2) Conduct education on democratic cooperative management and good unity, strengthen the sense of responsibility of all members and backbone members for running the cooperative well; (3) Conduct education on self-reliance, overcoming difficulties, and running the cooperative frugally, overcoming dependence and waste. In carrying out ideological education, criticism and self-criticism should be unfolded with leadership in combination with the actual problems existing in the cooperative, model and advanced examples should be commended, uprightness should be promoted, and unity should be strengthened.

4. Exchange good cooperative management experiences. Symposia can be held regularly: so that the experiences of advanced cooperatives have the opportunity to spread to weak cooperatives; it is also possible to organize cadres or member representatives of weak cooperatives to visit the neighboring better cooperatives; when conditions are ripe, a mutual assistance and cooperation network can be established to regularly exchange work experience.

5. Improve the ability of the backbone members of the cooperative and expand the ranks of the backbone members of the cooperative. When helping each cooperative improve its work, it is necessary to rely on the internal forces of each cooperative and not to do everything for them; at the same time, county and district cadres should patiently and enthusiastically teach the village branch cadres and cooperative backbone members while working, and help them solve practical problems, and not simply criticize and blame them. Attention should be paid to cultivating activists, consciously helping them establish prestige among the masses, expanding the leadership force, and forming a leadership core. This can not only create conditions for developing party and league members in the future, but also lay the foundation for fundamentally reversing the situation of weak cooperatives in the future. The backbone members of the cooperative, especially the director, should be educated to learn to manage the cooperative democratically, discuss matters with the members, the council should be responsible for division of labor, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all members and the council; learn to organize labor, give full play to the labor force of the members, and overcome the blindness and confusion in production and the phenomenon of no one being responsible. It is necessary to improve the working ability and ideological level of the village branch, so that the village branch can regularly strengthen the leadership of the agricultural production cooperative and ensure the normal development of the cooperative. Only in this way can weak cooperatives be truly improved into sound cooperatives, and the "resurrection" phenomenon of "people leaving and work leaving" can be avoided.

    黑龙江省绥化县薄弱社情况调查
    中共黑龙江省委农村工作部
    为了帮助薄弱的农业生产合作社的迅速改正缺点，我们在绥化县召开了“薄弱社工作座谈会”；并深入六区兴福村王振东社和马显成社（两个较差的社）进行了调查工作。我们了解到的情况和我们对改进薄弱社的意见如下：
    一、薄弱社的情况
    绥化全县有十个薄弱社，占现有社的百分之六点七，都是今年新建的社，绝大多数处在偏僻边沿地带或工作薄弱的村里。这些社的建社条件基本具备，并有一定的领导骨干；但建社半年来这十个社的生产总是落后的；经营管理都很混乱；社的领导力量薄弱，社员信心低落。
    从生产上看：十个社有九个社的生产还不如当地互助组好，进度慢，耕作质量比较粗糙。如六区王振东社，社内劳动力和土地的比例和当地互助组相等，但社的生产却落在互助组后面。全村头遍铲?基本结束时，社内还有三十二垧地一锄没动。后来请人帮工，才算没扔地；耕作质量也不如当地较好的互助组或单干户。就目前情况看，其中有三个社如果不及时大力改进，一定要减产，到秋后要比互助组少打粮（原因是耕作粗糙，缺苗、瞎地多，中耕不及时等）。
    从经营管理上看：十个社有八个社是比较混乱的。生产没计划。如王振东社，夏锄要求铲?几遍，每种作物怎样要求，社员和理事会都不清楚，各人有各人的主张和见解。劳动组织比较松懈，劳动计算也不合理。因此，出勤率很低。马显成社二十个男劳力，平均每天都有四、五个歇工的；有时歇工的超过半数。计工是“老十二分”，既不实行死订活评，又不实行小包工，影响了社员的劳动积极性。
    在财务管理上，一般是制度不健全，花钱没计划，少数社贯彻勤俭办社精神不够。马显成社铺张浪费，至目前已欠外债两千多万元；建社时花一千多万买一台胶皮车，现在“干闲”，积压了资金，还得出利息；不少社账目混乱，有的社半年来一次账目也没公布。许多社员说：“合作社的账不清，我的心就乱。”
    从政治工作上看：一般都是开会少，教育少，社内外没有竞赛，一切会议不按时召开。王振东社半年多只开了一次批评检讨会，结果是“会没开好，仇疙瘩更大了”。
    从社员思想上看：社员们一般是相信合作社“这条道好”的，可是不相信自己所在的合作社能搞好。据六区两个薄弱社看，真正有长远打算，并积极干的社员是少数；多数抱着观望的态度说
  “好就干，不好就散”；少数社员盼望社垮台，
  “下雨不如下雹子好，打光了不用铲”，铲地时鼓动别人“粗拉点干”，不服从领导。有的社员曾因春耕时卖糖葫芦影响生产，被劝止后，他就说：
  “合作社把我的‘钱串子’给‘撅’（折断）了！”这类人常说：“走差了一步棋，当初不该入社。”
  “手插到磨眼里了！”“到秋说啥也不干了。”有的说合作社像“笆篱子”，使人“不自由”。七区王明久社十一户分成了三派，名义上是贫农当主任，实际上是富裕户操纵社，把持领导，排斥贫困户；社内许多工作贯彻不下去。
      二、形成薄弱社的原因
    1、县委区委（主要是区委）对这些社缺乏全面的了解和深入的领导。县区干部下乡时，愿到先进社，不愿到边远的落后社；或者只一般地叫某同志负责“照顾一下”，结果是这些社长期无人领导。这是形成薄弱社的基本原因。
    2、有些社建社工作粗糙。如王振东社建社时，硬“劝”了三户入社；其中有两户现在常闹问题，社干部后悔“当初不该强求他入社”。建社时没解决好的遗留问题也多，有的社连马租多少都没确定，社员们说“心里没底”，是个“糊涂社”。
    3、社的领导骨干没有经验，特别是主任能力弱，有半数左右的薄弱社理事不团结；这些社又处在边远地带，距离有经验的社较远，遇有难题不能及时解决；长久下去，就形成了薄弱社。
    三、怎样改进薄弱社的工作
    就座谈会上的意见和我们在两个落后社工作的经验来看，应着重从这样几方面改进薄弱社的工作：
      1、用落后社的事实及其在群众中发生的不好的影响来提醒干部和教育干部，使他们正视改变落后社情况的必要，使他们了解“只许办好，不许办坏”的重要意义。在座谈会上，大家认为：如果社办坏了，结果不但要少打粮，而且对社外影响很坏，对合作化运动的发展有很大妨碍。经过座谈后，社员要求县区领导方面去帮助工作。县委拟再次召集有薄弱社的区的区委，研究布置加强薄弱社的工作；特别是对于三个肯定会减产的社，拟派得力干部帮助他们扭转局面，搞好生产。
    2、县委区委应立即指派得力干部，普遍深入检查薄弱社的工作。要找出各社的症结和改进的关键，对症下药，迅速改进。目前应特别注意帮助各社找出各该社的增产关键，努力提高单位面积产量，保证增加社员收入。如王振东社，没有生产计划，有的主张夏锄第二遍不铲就?，有的主张加工铲二遍，有的主张两遍就挂锄，有的主张要多就非请工不可。后来召开了社员大会，挖掘劳动潜力，民主制订了夏锄计划，计算了社内劳动力和耕作时间、活计，确定不请工也可以做到扣槎地两铲两?，耲槎地三铲三?。同时，还建立了十日满勤奖励制。这样做了之后，劳动出勤率有所增加，社员们还满意。
    3、加强对薄弱社骨干和群众的思想教育。（1）进行社会主义教育，坚定社员办社信心；
  （2）进行民主办社和搞好团结的教育，加强全体社员和骨干分子对办好合作社的责任感；（3）进行自力更生、克服困难、勤俭办社的教育，克服依赖思想和浪费现象。在进行思想教育中，应结合社内存在的实际问题，有领导地展开批评和自我批评，表扬模范先进事例，发扬正气，加强团结。
    4、交流好的办社经验。可以定期召开座谈会：使先进社的经验有机会向薄弱社传播；也可以组织薄弱社干部或社员代表到邻近的较好的社实地参观；条件成熟时可建立互助合作网，定期交流工作经验。
    5、提高社内骨干分子的能力，扩大社内骨干分子的队伍。在帮助各社改进工作时，要依靠各社内部的力量，不可包办代替；同时，县区干部对村支部干部和社内骨干要耐心地热忱地边作边教，帮助他们解决实际问题，不可单纯地批判指责。要注意培养积极分子，有意识地帮助他们在群众中树立威信，扩大领导力量，形成领导核心。这不仅可以为今后发展党员团员创造条件，也可以为今后从根本上扭转薄弱社的局面打下基础。要教育社内骨干分子，特别是社主任，学会民主办社，有事和社员商量，理事分工负责，发挥全体社员和理事会的积极性和创造性；学会组织劳动，充分发挥社员们的劳动力，克服生产上的盲目混乱和无人负责现象。要提高村支部的工作能力和思想水平，使村支部能经常加强对农业生产合作社的领导，保证合作社的正常发展。只有这样，薄弱社才能真正改进为健全的社，才可以不发生“人走工作走”的“回生”现象。
