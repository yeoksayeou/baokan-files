The "Provisional Regulations on Rewards for Production-Related Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals" were drafted based on the "Decision on Rewarding Production-Related Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals" issued by the Government Administration Council in August 1950, with reference to the "Instructions on Rewarding Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals" approved by the Soviet Council of People's Commissars in November 1942, and incorporating the practical experience of various regions and industries in carrying out rationalization proposal work over the past few years. The following are explanations on several major issues in the draft regulations.

	I. On the Definition of Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals

	According to Article 3 of the "Provisional Regulations on the Protection of Invention Rights and Patent Rights" promulgated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council in 1950, inventions refer to the creation of new production tools, machines, new products, or the development of industrial methods for manufacturing chemical substances. It should be emphasized that inventions must be limited to those that can be realized in industrial manufacturing. For example, simply discovering a chemical substance is not sufficient to be granted an invention certificate; however, if an industrial method for manufacturing this chemical substance is created, invention rights are granted, an invention certificate is obtained, and a bonus is received according to the reward regulations after adoption.

	The definitions of technical improvements and rationalization proposals are clearly defined in Articles 4 and 5 of these regulations, but in actual implementation, difficulties exist in distinguishing and determining technical improvements or rationalization proposals. The signs for dividing and determining technical improvements or rationalization proposals are mainly based on the degree of change to the structure of existing machinery and equipment or the production process by the new proposal, and the creativity demonstrated by the proposer. For example, Ge Fengshan of the Tianjin Renli Woolen Textile Factory suggested widening the loom surface to increase the width of the woolen fabric, which is a major improvement to the structure of the machinery and equipment, and should therefore be considered a technical improvement. For example, in order to solve the problem of excessively long iron filings during high-speed cutting, someone proposed installing a simple chip breaking device on the lathe tool holder. Such a proposal can only be considered a rationalization proposal, because although this proposal improves technical safety and facilitates more effective use of the machine, it does not change the machine structure or the production process.

	Improvements in the production process refer to improvements in the processing process that changes the shape, size, performance, or position of the object of labor. For example, suggestions such as multi-tool, multi-blade, high-speed cutting, and combining several operations into one operation are all major improvements to the production process.

	Article 5 of these regulations stipulates that rationalization proposals must be production technology-related proposals. Proposals that are not production technology-related, such as proposals to improve living conditions, shall not be called rationalization proposals. All rationalization proposals must have concrete improvement measures and have significant results in increasing production, improving quality, or reducing costs. General "suggestions" cannot be considered rationalization proposals.

	Current reward methods stipulate that the first successful imitation of a scarce material in the country is called a technical improvement or rationalization proposal, which is inappropriate; because imitation only involves moving the manufacturing methods from other countries or other places for application, without demonstrating originality. Similarly, any proposal to promote advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, advanced experiences from other domestic units, or methods previously implemented by the unit in the unit, cannot be called a rationalization proposal. However, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of the above-mentioned initiators, to improve production, appropriate rewards may also be given. The bonuses should not be issued according to the reward methods for inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals, and can be paid from the enterprise reward fund.

	II. On Reward Standards

	The reward standards for inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals are determined based on their role in production.

	In order to increase the country's capital accumulation, and considering that the state also pays more for the research, experimentation, and other expenses required for suggestions with great savings value, and the size of the savings value also depends on the size of the promotion scope of the suggestion, the percentage of the bonus is reduced; at the same time, because the corresponding additional number is stipulated for the percentage of the bonus, the absolute amount of the bonus received by the proposer still increases with the increase in the savings value, and the greater the savings value created by the suggestion, the more the proposer receives.

	Article 7 of these regulations stipulates the maximum amount of the bonus. Regardless of the expansion of the scope of adoption and the increase in the savings value, the maximum annual amount of the invention bonus shall not exceed 500 million yuan, the maximum amount of the technical improvement bonus shall not exceed 200 million yuan, and the maximum amount of the rationalization proposal bonus shall not exceed 100 million yuan.

	III. On Rewards for Technical Improvements and Rationalization Proposals Directly Related to One's Own Duties

	All inventions, regardless of whether they are directly related to their own duties, are rewarded according to the reward regulations (see Article 10), but technical improvements and rationalization proposals that are directly related to their own duties must be original and have technical creative factors. This provision is to encourage all employees to give full play to their creativity in their work and promote the development of mass inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals.

	The duties of engineering and technical personnel and management personnel are mainly to organize and plan production most effectively and to ensure the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of various indicators of the state plan. Suggestions made within this scope generally cannot be regarded as technical improvements or rationalization proposals. For example, if the machine tools in a factory are arranged very disorderly, and the chief engineer suggests arranging them neatly, this is his duty and should not be rewarded; for example, if a designer designs a project, his task is to make the project strong and durable, and save raw materials. Suggestions made within the scope of his task will not be rewarded either. However, when engineering and technical personnel and management personnel propose technical improvements or rationalization proposals that are directly related to their own duties but are original and have technical creative factors, they should be rewarded according to the regulations after adoption. For example, Wang Jiaxiang, engineer, Li Xianliang, technician, and Ai Wenqin, technical worker of the state-owned Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, jointly created a fiber impurity separator, which can effectively distinguish impurities, short fibers and effective fibers in waste cotton, thereby improving product quality and reducing costs. This is an original proposal and should be rewarded according to the regulations.

	The duties of workers are mainly to organize work locations reasonably, make full use of working hours, ensure quality, and complete and overfulfill production tasks. Suggestions made within the scope of these duties (such as proposing methods to keep the work location clean during handover) should generally not be rewarded as rationalization proposals. However, technical improvements or creative rationalization proposals proposed by workers should be rewarded according to the regulations after adoption.

	In short, the suggestions made by workers, engineering and technical personnel and management personnel that are directly related to their duties should be carefully analyzed and studied based on the actual situation and handled with caution, and should not be done simply.

	IV. On Rewards for Assisting Others in Realizing Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals

	Chapter 3 of these regulations has special provisions for rewarding those who assist others in realizing inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals. Its significance lies in encouraging all employees, especially enterprise leaders and engineering and technical personnel, to strongly support and actively help proposers so that proposals can be improved or realized as soon as possible. It is absolutely necessary to give appropriate rewards to workers, engineering and technical personnel and management personnel who actively assist others in realizing proposals.

	V. On the Reward Period and Bonus Calculation

	Article 7 of these regulations stipulates that the amount of bonuses for inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals shall be calculated based on the value saved within twelve months after adoption. If the scope of adoption is expanded, the savings value shall also be calculated according to the adoption period of the original proposal enterprise. If a suggestion is adopted by the original proposal enterprise (Factory A) from February 1954, and another enterprise (Factory B) from June of the same year, it shall be calculated until January 1955; that is, Factory A shall be calculated from February 1954 to January of the following year, and Factory B shall be calculated from June 1954 to January of the following year, and so on. The adoption range for inventions is also calculated in the same way for three to five years.

	Chapter 4 of these regulations has detailed provisions on the calculation of bonuses. Only Article 25 is explained. The construction engineering cost referred to in this article refers to the entire engineering cost. If the planned cost of a construction project is 60 billion yuan and the service life of the project is 30 years, the annual depreciation cost of the project is 2 billion yuan; however, due to the adoption of a certain suggestion, the entire project cost is reduced by 3 billion yuan while ensuring that the original quality standards are not lowered, that is, 20% of 3 billion yuan is taken as the annual savings value, and then the bonus that the proposer should receive is calculated according to the ratio stipulated in Article 7. Another situation is that, due to the adoption of a certain suggestion, the service life of the project is extended by ten years and the project cost remains unchanged, then the annual project depreciation cost is reduced from 2 billion yuan to 1.5 billion yuan, that is, 500 million yuan is saved each year, saving a total of 20 billion yuan, and then 20% of the 20 billion yuan is taken as the annual savings value, and then the bonus that the proposer should receive is calculated according to the ratio stipulated in Article 7. The reason for this provision is that the material cost accounts for a large proportion of the entire construction engineering cost. In order to make the bonus consistent with the actual savings situation, calculating according to the total amount of the savings value may artificially increase the bonus. As for the savings value of a certain cost caused by the adoption of suggestions in the construction process, the bonus is calculated based on the total savings value.

	VI. On the Budget for Bonuses

	Article 6 of these regulations stipulates that the budgets of various economic departments and enterprises should include items such as bonuses, research fees and experimental fees for inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals. This budget can be determined based on the amount of bonuses paid by each unit in the previous year plus the percentage that is expected to increase in the current year. The scope of use of this budget is: bonuses for rewarding inventors, technical improvers, and rationalization proposers; payment of research, experimentation, drawings, and manufacturing model costs required for suggestions; and bonuses for rewarding assistance in realizing inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals, etc.

    中华全国总工会对“有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”若干问题的说明
    “有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”系根据一九五○年八月政务院发布的“关于奖励有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的决定”，参考一九四二年十一月苏联人民委员会批准的“关于奖励发明、技术改进及合理化建议的指示”，并吸取几年来各地区各产业在开展合理化建议工作中的实际经验而拟定的。兹对条例草案中若干较大问题作如下说明。
    一、关于发明、技术改进及合理化建议的界说问题
    根据一九五○年政务院财政经济委员会公布的
  “保障发明权与专利权暂行条例”第三条关于发明界说的规定，凡创造新的生产工具、机器或创制新的生产品或研究出制造化学物品的工业方法等，均称之为发明。应该着重指出，所谓发明，必须以能在工业制造中实现者为限。例如只是发现某种化学物品，还不能发给发明证书；可是如果创造出制造这种化学物品的工业方法时，就给予发明权，取得发明证书，经采用后按奖励条例领取奖金。
    技术改进、合理化建议的界说在本条例第四、五两条中已作了明确的规定，但在实际执行中，划分与确定技术改进或合理化建议的困难是存在的。划分与确定技术改进或合理化建议的标志，主要是根据新的建议对现有机器设备结构或生产技术过程的改变程度如何，以及建议者所发挥的创造性如何。例如天津仁立毛呢纺织厂葛凤山建议将织机面加宽，使呢料阔度增加，这是对机器设备结构作了重大改进，因此应该算技术改进。再如，为了解决高速切削时铁屑过长的问题，有人提出在车床刀架上装一个简单断屑装置的建议，这样的建议只能算合理化建议，因为这个建议虽然改进了技术安全，便于更有效地利用机器，但对机床结构和生产技术过程并没有改变。
    生产技术过程的改进系指使劳动对象发生形状、大小、性能或位置变化的加工过程的改进。例如多刀多刃、高速切削、合并几个作业为一个作业等建议，均属对生产技术过程有重大改进。
    本条例第五条规定合理化建议必须是生产技术性的建议，至于非生产技术性的建议，如改善生活居住条件的建议，不得称为合理化建议。凡合理化建议必须有具体改进办法，并对增加产量、提高质量或降低成本有显著成效者，一般的“提意见”不能算合理化建议。
    现行奖励办法中有规定对于缺乏的物质在国内首先仿造成功，称为技术改进或合理化建议，这是不恰当的；因为仿造只是把其他国家或别处的制造方法搬过来运用，并没有发挥独创性。同样，凡将苏联和人民民主国家的先进经验、国内其他单位的先进经验或本单位以往实行过的办法，建议本单位推行，均不能称为合理化建议。但为了鼓励上述各项倡议者的积极性，以利于改进生产，亦可酌予奖励，其奖金不得按发明、技术改进、合理化建议的奖励办法发给，可由企业奖励基金项下开支。
    二、关于奖励标准问题
    发明、技术改进、合理化建议的奖励标准系根据其在生产中的作用大小来规定的。
    为了增加国家的资金积累，并考虑到对节约价值大的建议，国家付出该项建议所需的研究、试验等费用亦较大，而节约价值的大小还决定于建议推广范围的大小，所以提奖励金的百分比是递减的；同时因为规定了与提奖励金百分比相应的附加数，使建议者所得奖金的绝对数仍然随着节约价值的增多而递增，建议所造成的节约价值愈大，则建议者所得奖金就愈多。
    本条例第七条关于奖金最高额的规定，不问采用范围的扩大和节约价值的增多，发明奖金每年最高额不得超过五亿元，技术改进奖金最高额不得超过二亿元，合理化建议奖金最高额不得超过一亿元。
    三、对与本身职责范围有直接关联的技术改进及合理化建议的奖励问题
    凡属发明，不问其与本身职责有无直接关联，均按奖励条例给以奖励（见第十条），但技术改进、合理化建议如与本身职责有直接关联，则必须具有独创性，并带有技术创造因素。这样规定，是为了鼓励全体职工在工作中发挥高度的创造性，推动群众性的发明、技术改进、合理化建议的开展。
   工程技术人员和管理人员的职责，主要是最有效地组织与计划生产，保证全面地完成与超额完成国家计划的各项指标，在这个范围内提出的建议，一般不能算技术改进或合理化建议。例如某厂机床安排非常零乱，总工程师建议安排整齐，这是他应尽的职责，不应给以奖励；又如某设计师设计一项工程，他的任务就在于使这项工程既坚固耐用，又能节省原材料，在他任务范围内所提出的建议，也不给予奖励。但是，当工程技术人员和管理人员所提出与本身职责虽有直接关联而具有独创性，并带有技术创造因素的技术改进或合理化建议，经采用后则应按条例给以奖励。例如国营天津第六棉纺织厂工程师王家祥、技师李宪梁和技术工人艾文钦等共同创造了纤维杂质分离机，能有效地分清落棉中的杂质、短纤维和有效纤维，因而既能提高产品质量，又能降低成本，这就是具有独创性的建议，就应按条例给予奖励。
   工人的职责主要是合理地组织工作地点、充分地利用工时、保证质量、完成与超额完成生产任务，在这些职责范围之内所提出的建议（如提出交班时保持工作地点整洁的办法）一般不应按合理化建议给以奖励。但是工人所提出的技术改进或创造性的合理化建议，经采用后则应按条例给以奖励。
    总之，对工人、工程技术人员和管理人员所提出的与本身职责有直接关联的建议，应该根据实际情况，具体分析研究，慎重处理，不能简单从事。
    四、对协助他人实现发明、技术改进、合理化建议的奖励问题
    本条例第三章对协助他人实现发明、技术改进、合理化建议的奖励有了专门规定，其意义在于鼓励所有职工，特别是企业领导人员和工程技术人员大力支持与积极帮助建议者，使建议得以更完善或早日实现。对积极协助他人实现建议的工人、工程技术人员和管理人员给予适当的奖励是完全必要的。
    五、关于奖励期限和奖金计算问题
    本条例第七条规定，发明、技术改进、合理化建议的奖金数额，按采用后十二个月内所节约的价值计算，如采用的范围扩大，节约价值同样按原建议企业所采用的期限计算。如某一建议，原建议企业（甲厂）从一九五四年二月开始采用，另一企业
  （乙厂）从同年六月开始采用，则一律计算到一九五五年一月；即甲厂从一九五四年二月计算到次年
  一月，乙厂从一九五四年六月计算到次年一月，余此类推，逾期不予计算。发明的采用范围扩大，亦同上述办法计算三年到五年。
    关于奖金的计算问题，本条例第四章已有详细规定，仅对第二十五条加以说明。该条所指建筑工程费用系指整个工程费用而言。如某一建筑工程费用计划为六百亿元，工程使用年限为三十年，则每年工程的折旧费为二十亿元；但由于采用了某项建议，在保证不降低原定质量标准的条件下，使整个工程费用减低了三十亿元，即按三十亿元的百分之二十作为年节约价值，再根据第七条所规定的比例计算建议者应得的奖金。另一种情况，如前项工程由于采用某项建议，使工程使用年限延长了十年，工程费用不变，则每年的工程折旧费由二十亿元降至十五亿元，亦即每年节约了五亿元，共节约二百亿元，然后按二百亿元的百分之二十作为年节约价值，再根据第七条规定的比例计算建议者应得的奖金。其所以这样规定，是因为整个建筑工程费用中材料费占很大比重，为使奖金与实际节约情况相符合，如果按节约价值总额计算，就可能造成人为的增加奖金。至于在建筑过程中因采用建议而造成的某项费用的节约价值，则按全部节约价值计算奖金。
    六、关于奖金的预算问题
    本条例第六条规定各经济主管部门及各企业的预算中应列有备付发明、技术改进、合理化建议的奖金、研究费及试验费等项目。此项预算可根据各单位上年度支出的奖金数额加上本年度预计可能增加的百分比来确定。此项预算的使用范围是：奖励发明、技术改进、合理化建议者的奖金；支付建议所需的研究、试验、图样及制造模型等费用；以及奖励协助实现发明、技术改进、合理化建议的奖金等。
