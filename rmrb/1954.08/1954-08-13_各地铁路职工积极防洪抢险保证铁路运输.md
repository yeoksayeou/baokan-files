Railway workers in various regions are making their utmost efforts to prevent floods and carry out emergency repairs, fighting to ensure uninterrupted railway transportation during the rainy season.

Since the beginning of summer, the water levels of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers have risen, and the section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway from Shekou to Jiang'an and the section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway from Bengbu to Li'erzhuang are in danger of being blocked by floods at any time. In severely affected areas, the water level has exceeded the rail surface. The Ministry of Railways has decided to ensure traffic by raising the roadbed. Currently, the Zhengzhou Railway Administration is constantly raising the roadbed in the Shekou and Jiang'an sections, and the workers are working in the rain. Even when the floodwaters overflowed the tracks, railway workers waded through the water to guide the trains forward, ensuring the transportation of flood control materials and disaster relief supplies. After the start of flood control, the employees of the Bengbu Transportation Branch of the Jinan Railway Administration actively rushed to repair the roadbed, maintained passenger traffic on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and gave priority to the transportation of Huai River flood control materials.

The flood control and emergency repair projects in Linhuai Pass, Jiangsu Longtan and Ningpu and other regions led by the Shanghai Railway Administration have achieved great success, ensuring the operation of the four railway trunk lines of Pu-Bengbu, Ning-Hu, Hu-Hangzhou and Zhe-Gan. Leaders such as the director and deputy director of the bureau led more than 10,000 people to join this struggle, and received the support of two to three thousand people from brother bureaus such as Tianjin and Jinan, as well as the help of People's Liberation Army soldiers, farmers and young students near the construction site.

The Shenyang Railway Branch held a telephone conference on August 3 to redeploy flood control work. The meeting required all stations and engineering sections to prepare sufficient vehicles, stones and manpower for immediate use. At present, all stations and sections have actively taken action.

Flood control equipment consigned by various departments has been listed by the railway department as the first priority of the transportation plan, and is transported as soon as it arrives. From July 1 to early August, nearly 40,000 cars of sand, square wood, grass bags, mats, pumping machines and other flood control equipment have been continuously transported to flood-stricken areas such as Wuhan and Linhuai Pass. The daily necessities such as grain and coal, industrial production raw materials, disaster relief materials, and late autumn crop seeds needed in Wuhan and other places have all been transported in a timely manner.

    各地铁路职工积极防洪抢险保证铁路运输
    【本报讯】各地铁路职工正以最大努力防洪抢险，为在雨季不间断铁路运输而斗争。
    入夏以来，长江、淮河水位上涨，京汉路滠口到江岸段和津浦路蚌埠到李二庄段，随时有被洪水阻断的危险，严重地段的水位已超过轨面。中央铁道部决定用加高路基的办法来保证通车。现在郑州铁路管理局在滠口、江岸段正不断加高路基，职工们冒雨工作。这段路基即使在洪水漫溢道轨的时候，铁路工人们还是涉水引导着列车前进，保证了防汛器材和救灾物资的运输。济南铁路管理局蚌埠运输分局职工在防汛开始后，积极抢修路基，一直维持津浦铁路的客运交通，并优先载运淮河防汛物资。
    上海铁路管理局领导的安徽临淮关、江苏龙潭和宁浦等地区的防洪抢险工程，已取得很大成绩，保证了浦蚌、宁沪、沪杭和浙赣四条铁路干线的通车。该局局长、副局长等领导干部，率领一万多人投入这一斗争，并得到了天津、济南等兄弟路局的两、三千人的支援，和工地附近解放军战士、农民和青年学生的帮助。
    沈阳铁路分局八月三日召开电话会议，再次布置防汛工作。会议要求各车站各工务段准备足够的车辆、石块及人力，以备随时应用。目前各站段已积极行动起来。
    各部门托运的防汛器材都被铁路部门列为运输计划的第一位，随到随运。从七月一日到八月上旬，已经把将近四万辆车的沙石、方木、草袋、席子、抽水机等防汛器材，源源运到了武汉和临淮关等洪水地区。武汉等地所需的粮食、煤等生活必需品和工业生产原料、以及救灾物资、晚秋作物种籽等，都做到了及时运输。
