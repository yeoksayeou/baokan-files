The Broad Masses of People Enthusiastically Discuss the Draft Constitution

    The Draft Constitution Brings Happiness to the People in Every Article
    By Nan Fang

    On August 2nd, all the representatives attending the First Session of the First Guangdong Provincial People's Congress enthusiastically discussed the draft constitution and expressed their heartfelt support.

    During the discussions, the representatives generally recognized that the draft constitution is the fruit of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people. The people's representatives from the old revolutionary base areas have an even deeper understanding of this. Ye Lianxiang, a representative from Zijin County and a martyr's family member who was disabled during the Second Revolutionary Civil War while fighting against the Kuomintang reactionaries, recalled the events of that time. Her whole family participated in the revolutionary work. Once, the reactionaries surrounded their village. She and the villagers fought the enemy, but because the enemy was numerous and they were few, her husband and father-in-law heroically sacrificed themselves in the battle. The enemy broke in, killed her five-year-old child, burned her house, and finally cut off both of her hands. However, the enemy's brutality did not subdue the revolutionary people. Ye Lianxiang endured all kinds of hardships and finally witnessed the victory of the revolution. Now that she sees the draft constitution consolidating the achievements of the revolutionary struggle, she is overjoyed. She said, "The blood of the revolutionary martyrs was not shed in vain, and my husband and father-in-law did not sacrifice in vain. Now that the people are in charge, we must protect the fruits of the revolutionary victory so that we can smoothly transition to a socialist society." Huang Guanfeng, a representative from the old revolutionary base area of Baxiang Mountain in Fengshun County, compared the bitter days of the past with the happy life of today and said excitedly, "Every article of the draft constitution brings happiness to the working people. We must resolutely defend this victory."

    During the discussions, the representatives enthusiastically supported the provision in the draft constitution that China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, believing that this provision provides a reliable guarantee for China's transition to a socialist society. The draft constitution also stipulates that labor is a glorious thing, and the state encourages the enthusiasm and creativity of the people in labor, which will fully mobilize the working people's enthusiasm for building socialism. Hu Qi, a representative from Dongguan County and an industrial labor model, said, "Before liberation, I was a worker whom no one looked up to. But after liberation, under the cultivation of the Party and the government, I was promoted to the deputy director of the Dongguan Sugar Factory. Before liberation, the Dongguan Sugar Factory could only squeeze 800 tons of sugarcane per day. After liberation, the workers displayed their enthusiasm and improved the machines and working methods, increasing the daily squeezing volume to 1,500 tons. Only in a country led by the working class can the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers be fully发挥, and production can develop so rapidly. From the production of the sugar factory, I also deeply realized the importance of the worker-peasant alliance. Because the peasant brothers realized the importance of supporting industrial construction, the peasants have already pre-sold more than 200,000 tons of sugarcane to the Dongguan Sugar Factory, ensuring the supply of raw materials for the sugar factory and enabling the sugar factory to produce more sugar for the country. From these facts, I further realized the correctness of the draft constitution, and I wholeheartedly support the draft constitution." The peasant representatives felt infinitely excited about the provisions in the draft constitution regarding the state's encouragement, guidance, and assistance in the development of cooperative economy, and the use of developing production cooperatives as the main path for transforming individual agriculture. Zeng Hanrong (director of an agricultural production cooperative), a representative from Meixian County, talked about the fact that the nineteen households in his village, under the leadership and assistance of the Party and the People's Government, had organized themselves and increased production year after year. Those nineteen households had more than ninety mu of land in 1950, and the total annual harvest was only 44,535 jin. In the first year after being organized, it increased to 51,510 jin, the second year to 67,290 jin, and the third year to 77,440.5 jin. Through the comparison of these concrete facts, the representatives all expressed their heartfelt support for the draft constitution. The representatives of handicraftsmen also wholeheartedly supported the provisions in the draft constitution on carrying out the socialist transformation of handicrafts. Representatives from industrial and commercial circles also recognized the bright future of state capitalism and expressed their warm support for the state's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce.

    When discussing the provisions in the draft constitution regarding the democratic system and the people's power, many representatives recalled the suffering they had endured in the old society and the situation of being masters of their own affairs after liberation. Guo Renguang, a representative from Zhuhai County, the head of Xiangzhou Township, and the director of the Fishermen's Association, said, "Fishermen had no political status before liberation. We only had the 'right' to be exploited and the obligation to work like beasts of burden. Life was very hard. But after liberation, it was very different. The fishermen were all emancipated. I was originally an ordinary fisherman, but I was actually elected as a representative to the provincial People's Congress, which was something I never dared to dream of in the past." Wang Guoxing, the chairman of the People's Government of the Li and Miao Autonomous Region of Hainan Island, compared the situation before and after liberation when talking about the political status of ethnic minorities. He said, "The Kuomintang reactionary government was very discriminatory against ethnic minorities before liberation. After liberation, under the shining of the Communist Party's great ethnic policy, the lives of the ethnic minorities have gradually improved. Today, the Li, Miao, and Hui ethnic groups in Hainan, and the Yao and Zhuang ethnic groups in northern Guangdong, have all elected their own representatives to participate in the provincial People's Congress to jointly discuss state affairs. This is something that did not happen in the past." Shi Yasheng, an overseas Chinese who returned from Malaya and the vice chairman of the trade union of the state-owned Zhujiang Machinery Farm, said that when talking about the motherland's love and care for overseas Chinese, he believed that the provision in the draft constitution that overseas Chinese can elect their own representatives to participate in the National People's Congress and manage state affairs through their own representatives is something that only a country led by the working class can do.

    After discussing the draft constitution, the representatives all realized that in order to consolidate the victory already won by the people and ensure the victorious completion of socialist construction, it is necessary to heighten vigilance and strive to consolidate national defense and defend the integrity of the country's territorial sovereignty. The representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army unanimously expressed their determination to strengthen regular military training and join the broad masses of the people in defending the southern gate of the motherland, consolidating coastal and border defenses, and resolutely fighting for the liberation of Taiwan.

专栏：广大人民热烈讨论宪法草案

    宪法草案条条都给人民带来幸福
    南方
    八月二日，广东省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议全体到会代表，热烈地讨论了宪法草案，并表示衷心拥护。
    代表们在讨论中普遍认识到宪法草案是我国人民英勇斗争的果实，革命老根据地的人民代表对这方面的体会更是深刻。曾在第二次国内革命战争时期与国民党反动派进行斗争而残废的烈属、紫金县代表叶莲香，她想起了第二次国内革命战争时期的往事。那时，她全家都参加了革命工作。有一次反动派把他们的村庄包围了，她和乡里的人一起坚持和敌人战斗，但是因为敌众我寡，她的丈夫和公公都在战斗中光荣牺牲了；敌人打了进来，把她的五岁的孩子杀了，把她的房子烧了，最后还把她的两个手掌砍断了。但是敌人的残暴并不能使革命的人民屈服，叶莲香历尽辛酸，终于看到了革命的胜利。现在又看到宪法草案把革命斗争的成果巩固下来，她是多么高兴啊。她说：“革命先烈的血没有白流，我丈夫和公公也没有白白牺牲。现在人民当了家，我们就要好好保卫革命胜利果实，使我们能顺利地过渡到社会主义社会去。”丰顺县八香山革命老根据地的代表黄观凤想起过去的苦日子，和今天幸福生活相对比，不禁激动地说：“宪法草案条条都给劳动人民带来幸福，我们一定要坚决保卫这一胜利果实。”
    代表们在讨论中热烈拥护宪法草案规定我国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，认为这个规定对我国过渡到社会主义社会提供了可靠的保证；宪法草案又规定劳动是光荣的事情，国家鼓励人民在劳动中的积极性和创造性，这将充分发挥劳动人民建设社会主义的热情。东莞县代表、工业劳动模范胡启说：“解放前我是一个没有人看得起的工人；但解放后，我在党和政府的培养下，被提拔为东莞糖厂的副厂长。解放前东莞糖厂每天只能榨八百吨甘蔗，解放后，工人发挥了积极性，改良了机器和工作方法，每天压榨量提高到一千五百吨。只有在工人阶级领导下的国家才能充分发挥工人的积极性和创造性，生产才能这样飞速地发展。从糖厂生产来看，也使我深深体会到工农联盟的重要。由于农民兄弟认识了支援工业建设的重要，农民们已预售了二十多万吨甘蔗给东莞糖厂，保证了糖厂原料的供应，使糖厂能为国家生产更多的糖。从这些事实中，我进一步认识了宪法草案的正确，我衷心拥护宪法草案。”农民代表对于宪法草案中关于国家鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展，并以发展生产合作为改造个体农业的主要道路的规定，感到无限兴奋。梅县代表曾汉荣（农业生产合作社主任）谈到他村中的十九户农民在党和人民政府领导和帮助下，组织起来年年增产的事实。那十九户农民在一九五零年共有九十多亩田，全年收成只有四万四千五百三十五斤，组织起来的第一年，就增加到五万一千五百一十斤，第二年增加到六万七千二百九十斤，第三年增加到七万七千四百四十斤半。代表们通过这些具体事实的对比，都表示衷心拥护宪法草案。手工业工人代表在讨论中也衷心地拥护宪法草案中对手工业实行社会主义改造的规定。工商界代表在讨论中也认识到国家资本主义光明的前途，对国家对资本主义工商业实行利用、限制和改造的政策，表示热诚的拥护。
    不少代表在讨论到宪法草案中关于民主制度、关于人民权力的规定时，都回想到过去在旧社会所受的苦难及解放后当家作主的情形。珠海县代表、香洲乡乡长兼渔民协会主任郭仁广说：“渔民在解放前是没有政治地位的。我们只有被剥削的‘权利’和替人做牛马的义务，生活是很苦的。但是，解放后却大不相同了，渔民都翻身了。我本来是一个普通渔民，居然也被选为省人民代表，真是过去做梦也不敢想的事。”海南岛黎族苗族自治区人民政府主席王国兴谈到少数民族的政治地位时，他把解放前后的情形作了一个对比，他说：“解放前国民党反动政府是非常歧视少数民族的。解放后在共产党伟大的民族政策照耀下，少数民族人民的生活逐步改善了。今天海南黎族、苗族、回族，粤北的瑶族、僮族等，都选出了自己的代表参加省人民代表大会，来共同讨论国家大事。这是过去没有的事情。”马来亚归国华侨、国营珠江机械农场工会副主席施亚胜，谈到祖国对华侨的爱护和照顾时，他认为宪法草案中规定华侨能选举自己的代表参加全国人民代表大会，通过自己的代表来管理国家大事，这样的民主只有工人阶级领导的国家才能办到。
    经过宪法草案的讨论，代表们都认识到要巩固人民已得的胜利果实，保证社会主义的建设胜利完成，必须提高警惕，为巩固国防、保卫国家的领土主权的完整而斗争。中国人民解放军代表在讨论中一致表示要加强正规军事训练，和广大人民一起保卫祖国南大门，巩固海防、边防，坚决为解放台湾而斗争。
