　　　　On the Donglaotan Salt Field
　　　　By our reporter Bai Sheng

    Taking a train from Dalian to Chengzituan, getting off at Jiaxinzi Station, and then boarding a small train transporting salt, traveling east along the protective embankment for about fourteen or fifteen li, one sees an endless expanse of salt fields. This is the Donglaotan Salt Field of the Piziwo Saltworks on the Liaodong Peninsula.

    Summer is the peak season for salt production, and the salt workers are working intensely. Although there has been particularly heavy rainfall this year, which has affected the work of sun-drying salt, the salt workers have strengthened their operations before, during, and after the rain, taking advantage of good weather to speed up the sun-drying and raking of salt, ensuring the completion of this year's salt field production plan.

    The team led by Liu Guotai is an advanced production team. By July 27th, the entire team had already completed 97.26 percent of the annual production plan, and the quality of the salt is also particularly good.

    On the salt flats, I saw Liu Guotai and talked to him about the team's production situation and his thoughts on the draft constitution. He said, "I started working on the salt flats at the age of eighteen, and it's been over twenty years now. I really don't know how much suffering I've endured in the past. My father was worked to death on the salt flats. The salt workers lived in rotten mud houses and didn't even have bedding."

    I then asked him how the salt workers are living now. When Liu Guotai talked about the good days of today, he breathed a sigh of relief, his face beaming. He said, "The salt workers now realize that they are the masters of the salt flats, and they are displaying a high degree of enthusiasm, drying bright, sparkling white salt. Now, large water-lifting machines have been installed on the embankments to bring seawater into the flats; many small electric pumps on the salt flats are also running day and night. The salt workers are all using their brains to conduct research and learn advanced salt-drying experience. Since the start of the drying season this year, the zoning of the flats has been adjusted, expanding the area of the salt fields; the salt piles on the edges of the crystallization ponds are getting higher and higher, and the small trains are constantly going to the salt fields to transport the salt away."

    In the evening, Liu Guotai led me to visit the beach house. It was very spacious, with two large kangs (heated platforms) along the walls, covered with brand new mats, and luggage rolls neatly placed against the wall. A long table and two large benches were placed in the middle of the room. The salt workers were gathered around the table eating dinner. The radio was broadcasting inspiring songs. Production competition slogans were posted on the walls, as well as the team's production plan, work diary, and a blackboard for study. In addition, there were brand-new red and green thermos bottles, a large wall clock, and enamel washbasins, and white, checkered towels in the room. Liu Guotai told me that these were all prizes won in the production competition. He said with a smile: "Life now is much better than in the past. Now we live in clean brick houses, and in the past we lived in dirty, smelly mud houses, with grass on the kang and mud all over the floor, like living in a pigsty. Now, when we come back from work on the beach, we can lie on the kang and listen to the radio, we didn't have that in the past!"

    After dinner, everyone sat on the kang and chatted casually. Sun Deyun, a young salt worker, said excitedly, "The salt workers in our team have always been ahead in production. This time, during the peak production season, we also encountered the promulgation of the draft constitution. We must bring out the spirit of being masters of our own affairs, overcome the difficulties of cloudy and rainy weather that make salt drying difficult, and ensure the victorious completion of the salt production task." Another salt worker, Xin Decheng, also chimed in, "Our team must overfulfill this year's production task and accumulate more funds for the country." Salt worker Zhao Jingyuan said, "The weather was bad last year, which affected salt production, and the chemical plant next to our Donglaotan was also affected as a result. This year it's been cloudy and rainy again, but our workers have studied the draft constitution and our understanding has improved. Everyone is actively thinking of ways to carry out various operations in cloudy weather or heavy rain, paying attention to protecting the salt flats and ensuring production." Salt worker Song Tingxin said, "Each member of our team has special strengths, and our attendance rate is 100 percent, so we play a exemplary role in production. This time, we must also play a exemplary role in discussing the draft constitution."

    Leaving the beach house, the salt workers all ran to the club to watch a movie. On the way to the club, Liu Guotai told me excitedly that in the past, salt workers could not get close to this place, but now, this building has become the salt workers' club and bathhouse. From the contrast in living conditions, they deeply feel the happiness of today's life, and they feel particularly close to the draft constitution.

    在东老滩盐田上 　 本报记者　柏生
    从大连坐上开往城子疃的火车，到夹心子车站下车，再搭上运盐的小火车，沿着护滩坝东行约十四五里路，便见到一片望不尽的盐田，这就是辽东半岛貔子窝盐场的东老滩盐田。
    夏季是产盐的旺季，盐工们紧张地进行着生产。虽然今年雨水特别多，影响了晒盐的工作，但是由于盐工们加强了雨前、雨中和雨后的操作，利用好天气加紧晒盐、扒盐，使今年盐田生产计划的完成有了把握。
    柳国泰领导的小组，是一个先进生产小组，到七月二十七日，全组已经完成全年生产计划的百分之九十七点二六，而且盐的质量也特别好。
    在盐滩上，我看到了柳国泰，和他谈起了小组的生产情况和他对宪法草案的感想。他说：“打十八岁我上盐滩干活，到现在已经二十多年了。过去真不知受过多少的苦难，我的父亲就是在盐滩上活活累死的。盐工们住在烂泥房子里，连铺盖都没有。”
    我接着问他，盐工们现在的生活怎样？柳国泰一谈到今天的好日子，就舒展了一口气，脸上放着光彩。他说：“盐工们现在都认识到自己是盐滩上的主人了，发挥高度的积极性，晒出白花花亮晶晶的盐。如今，滩坝上又安装了大扬水机，把海水引进滩；滩头上的许多小电泵，也日夜不断地开动着。盐工们都开动脑筋，进行研究，并学习先进的晒盐经验。今年打下滩起，调整了滩田区划，扩大了盐田的面积；盐滩结晶池边上的盐坨愈来愈高，小火车每天不断地到盐田上把盐运走。”
    傍晚，柳国泰领我去参观滩房。这里，非常宽敞，墙边是两个大炕，上面铺着崭新的席子，行李卷整齐地放在靠墙处，房中间放着一张长桌和两条大长凳。盐工们正围着桌子吃晚饭。收音机正播送着令人振奋的歌曲。墙壁上贴着生产竞赛的标语，还挂着小组的生产计划、作业日记的本子和学习用的黑板。另外，在房里还放着簇新的红色、绿色暖水壶、大挂钟；还有洋瓷花脸盆，白色的、花格的手巾。柳国泰告诉我，这些都是在生产竞赛中获得的奖品。他笑着说：“现在的生活可比过去好多了，现在住的是干干净净的砖房，过去住的是又脏又臭的烂泥房子，炕上铺的是草，地上满是烂泥，就像住在猪圈里一样。现在，从滩上收工回来，躺在炕上就能听收音机，过去那有这个！”
    大家吃过晚饭，便坐在炕头上随便谈起来。青年盐工孙德运兴奋地说：“我们小组的盐工们，向来生产都不落后，这回在旺季生产中，又遇上宪法草案公布，咱一定要拿出当家作主的精神来，克服天阴雨多晒盐难的困难，保证胜利完成产盐任务。”另一个盐工辛德成也抢着说：“咱们小组一定要超额完成今年的生产任务，还要多给国家积累资金。”盐工赵经远说：“去年天气不好，影响了产盐，咱东老滩旁的那个化工厂也因此受了影响。今年又净是阴雨天，可是咱工人们学习了宪法草案，认识有了提高，大家在阴天或大雨中积极想办法进行各种操作，注意保护盐滩，保证生产。”盐工宋廷新说：“我们小组个个都有特长，出勤率又达到百分之百，因此生产上起着模范作用，这回讨论宪法草案也都要起模范作用。”
    从滩房里出来，盐工们都跑到俱乐部去看电影了。在向俱乐部走去的路上，柳国泰兴奋地告诉我，过去盐工们不能靠近这里，现在呢，这片房子成了盐工们的俱乐部和澡堂。从生活对比中，他们深切地感到今天生活的幸福，而对宪法草案也就感到分外亲切。
