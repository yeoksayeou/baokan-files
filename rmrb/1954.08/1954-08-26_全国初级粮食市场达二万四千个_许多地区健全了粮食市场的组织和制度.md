Since June, a large number of state-led rural primary grain markets have been newly established across the country. According to statistics from the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government as of the end of July, 24,387 state-managed primary grain markets have been established nationwide, an increase of one and a half times compared to the beginning of June. In East China, there were only more than 1,200 grain markets at the end of May, and this number increased to 6,010 by the end of July, an increase of approximately four times in two months. In Central South China, there were more than 2,000 grain markets at the beginning of June, and now there are more than 9,000. At present, the plans for establishing grain markets in Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and other provinces have been basically completed. The number of new-type grain markets established in Henan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Jilin, and other provinces exceeds the number of grain markets before the unified purchase and sale of grain. In Henan Province, there are now an average of three grain markets in each district, making it very convenient for the masses to regulate grain supply.

June and July are the most crucial and vigorous seasons for rural grain regulation. The establishment of a large number of new-type grain markets has played a significant role in facilitating grain regulation among the masses. In the Northeast region, an average of 650,000 jin of grain were listed on the grain market every day in late June, and an average of 690,000 jin were listed every day in late July, a considerable portion of which met the needs of grain-deficient farmers. Farmers in the Jingzhou, Huanggang, and Xiaogan special districts of Hubei Province regulated more than 2 million jin of grain through the grain market when preparing late rice seeds. Grain markets in various regions generally take into account the habits of farmers and try to provide them with convenience. Grain markets in Pinghu and Shaoxing in Zhejiang Province, and Wuxi and Yangzhou in Jiangsu Province, have also adopted methods such as "market consignment sales" to facilitate farmers in selling grain. Farmers in many areas of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces have praised the state-led grain markets: "Fair scales, reasonable prices, and convenient transactions."

During this period, various regions strengthened leadership and management of primary grain markets. In many areas of Sichuan, Henan, Guangxi, and other provinces, on the one hand, they strengthened publicity on national grain policies, and on the other hand, they established and improved grain market management committees. In addition to relevant departments such as industry and commerce administration, grain, and cooperatives, they also absorbed a number of village and township cadres to participate in the work of the management committee. Many areas of Henan, Hunan, and other provinces transferred cadres to strengthen leadership over grain markets. In Qi County, Henan Province, 43 grain markets were equipped with full-time cadres. In the Hengyang Special District of Hunan Province, full-time cadres leading and managing grain markets in various counties have been basically fully equipped. Many areas such as Fenghuang County in Hunan Province conducted serious reviews of grain market traders. Some areas conducted short-term rotational training for traders. Grain markets in areas such as Huazi Town in Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, established systems and organized traders to regularly conduct political and professional studies. Many grain markets in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, and other provinces improved work systems and improved work methods. In order to prevent and crack down on grain merchants and speculators, Nanzhao County in Henan Province established supervision groups in rural areas in addition to establishing a market management committee, mobilizing the masses to inspect and report speculative activities of grain merchants and others. In individual areas of Hebei Province, not long after the establishment of grain markets, due to poor management, grain merchants and speculators took the opportunity to engage in activities, and market trading conditions were once relatively chaotic. After the local government strengthened management, market trading conditions have returned to normal. In many areas such as Fuling County in Sichuan Province, after strengthening leadership in the grain market, the amount of grain listed on the market has increased significantly, and transactions have become more active.

    全国初级粮食市场达二万四千个
    许多地区健全了粮食市场的组织和制度
    六月份以来，全国各地新建立了大批国家领导的农村初级粮食市场。据中央人民政府粮食部截至七月底的统计，全国已建立二万四千三百八十七个国家管理的初级粮食市场，比六月初增加了一倍半。华东区五月底只有一千二百多个粮食市场，七月底增加到六千零十个，两个月大约增加了四倍；中南区六月初有二千多个粮食市场，现在已经增加到九千多个。目前，河北、山西、河南、江苏、浙江、山东等省建立粮食市场的计划已经基本完成；河南、山西、江苏、吉林等省建立的新型粮食市场，超过了粮食统购统销以前的粮食市场的数目，河南省现在平均每个区有三个粮食市场，群众调剂粮食非常方便。
    六、七月份，正是农村进行粮食调剂的最紧要、最旺盛的季节。大批新型粮食市场的建立，对便利群众调剂粮食起了很大的作用。东北区粮食市场在六月下旬平均每天上市粮食六十五万斤，七月下旬平均每天上市六十九万斤，其中有相当大的一部分满足了缺粮农民的需要。湖北省荆州、黄冈、孝感三个专区的农民在准备晚稻种籽的时候，通过粮食市场调剂的有二百多万斤。各地粮食市场一般都照顾农民的习惯，尽量给农民以方便；浙江省平湖、绍兴，江苏省无锡、扬州等地的粮食市场还采取“市场寄售”等办法，便利农民出卖粮食。福建、浙江等省许多地区的农民都称赞国家领导的粮食市场：“秤斗公道，议价合理，交易便利。”
    在这个期间，各地加强了对初级粮食市场的领导和管理。四川、河南、广西等省许多地区一方面加强了关于国家粮食政策的宣传，一方面建立和健全了粮食市场管理委员会，除工商行政、粮食、合作社等有关部门外，还吸收一批乡村干部参加管理委员会的工作。河南、湖南等省许多地区抽调干部，加强对粮食市场的领导。河南省杞县四十三个粮食市场都配备了专职干部，湖南省衡阳专区各县领导和管理粮食市场的专职干部基本上已经配备齐全。湖南省凤凰县等不少地区对粮食市场交易员进行了认真的审查；有些地区对交易员进行了短期轮训；辽宁省辽阳县铧子镇等地区的粮食市场建立制度，组织交易员经常进行政治学习和业务学习。山西、陕西、浙江等省许多粮食市场健全了工作制度，改进了工作方法。为了防范和取缔粮商、投机分子，河南省南召县除成立市场管理委员会外，还在农村建立了监督小组，发动群众检查和检举粮商等的投机活动。河北省个别地区建立粮食市场不久，因管理不善，粮商、投机分子乘机活动，市场交易情况一度比较混乱，经过当地政府加强管理，市场交易情况已趋于正常。四川省涪陵县等许多地区的粮食市场，经过加强领导，粮食上市量显著增加，交易更加活跃。
