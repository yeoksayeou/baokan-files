Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 11th: Under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the government, the Hungarian people, after weeks of tenacious struggle, have finally overcome the Danube flood, which was the worst since 1838. Now, the water level of the Danube has receded, and the villages and towns along the coast are no longer threatened by floods. The working farmers in the flooded areas are working hard to harvest and thresh grain after the flood recedes.

    Currently, the concern of the Hungarian government and the people of the whole country is focused on the residents of the areas that have been flooded. The Hungarian government has allocated a large amount of funds to repair the houses in Tisz region, which suffered the most severe damage from the floods. The government also provides interest-free loans to residents in flood-stricken areas and provides various assistance to working farmers in production. In order to rebuild the houses destroyed by the flood, Hungarian brick factories are producing a large number of bricks and tiles. Workers, farmers, and engineers from all over the country are also helping to rebuild the destroyed houses so that those affected by the flood can get new homes in the shortest possible time. In addition, writers and artists have held lectures and exhibitions to raise funds for the disaster victims. The Hungarian people are closely united around the Party and the government, and are fighting to make up for the losses caused by the flood.

    The Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries have expressed their deep sympathy to the residents of Hungary who have suffered from the flood, and have provided friendly assistance. The Soviet Ambassador to Hungary, Andropov, recently expressed to the Chairman of the Hungarian Council of Ministers, I. Nagy, the condolences of the Soviet government to the disaster-stricken residents, and donated 300,000 forints (Hungarian currency) to help them. The Romanian Embassy is also providing material assistance to the disaster victims in their recovery efforts.

    匈牙利人民战胜了多瑙河百年来未有的洪水
   【新华社十一日讯】布达佩斯消息：匈牙利人民在劳动人民党和政府的领导下，经过了几个星期的顽强斗争后，终于战胜了一八三八年以来从未有过的多瑙河的洪水。现在，多瑙河的水位已经下降，沿岸的村镇已不再受到洪水的威胁，水淹地区的劳动农民在洪水退走后正在紧张地进行收割和打谷工作。
    目前匈牙利政府和全国人民的关怀已集中到曾受水淹没的地区的居民身上。匈牙利政府已拨出大批款项来修复遭受水灾最严重的提厄州的住宅。政府并免利贷款给水灾地区的居民，在生产上给劳动农民以种种帮助。为了重建被水冲毁的房屋，匈牙利的砖瓦工厂正在生产大批的砖瓦。各地的工人、农民和工程师也在帮助重建被毁的房屋，使遭受水灾的人在最短期间内得到新居。此外，文学家、艺术家还纷纷举行讲演会、展览会来为灾民筹募基金。匈牙利人民正紧密地团结在党和政府的周围，为弥补洪水造成的损失而奋斗。
    苏联和各人民民主国家对匈牙利遭受水灾的居民表示了深挚的同情，并给予了友好的帮助。苏联驻匈牙利大使安德罗波夫最近曾向匈牙利部长会议主席伊·纳吉表达了苏联政府对受灾居民的慰问之意，并捐款三十万福林（匈币名）来帮助他们。罗马尼亚大使馆也在物质上帮助灾民进行恢复工作。
