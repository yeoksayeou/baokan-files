Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 23rd: Since the opening of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition three weeks ago, it has been visited by approximately 1.5 million people. More than 100 foreign delegations have visited the exhibition. The exhibition adopts methods such as guided tours, lectures, seminars, performances, and film screenings to promote the great achievements and advanced experiences of Soviet socialist agriculture.

In recent days, in various exhibition halls and exhibition areas, scenes of agricultural workers from all over the Soviet Union actively learning various advanced experiences can be seen everywhere. In a hall in the "Agronomy Exhibition Hall" specifically introducing advanced sowing methods, visitors learned about the narrow-row sowing method and cross-sowing method for grains, as well as the square-cluster planting method and square sowing method for planting potatoes and vegetables. They also visited the exhibition area to see the actual operation process of sowing using these methods. More than 100 groups visit the "Grain Exhibition Hall" every day. After visiting here, agricultural workers from the Orel region decided to promote the cross-oblique sowing method of the Bashtansky district of the Nikolaev region in their region. The Bashtansky district used this advanced method of sowing and harvested 27.7 quintals of winter wheat per hectare in 1952.

The "Ural Exhibition Hall" has been particularly crowded in recent days. Agricultural workers from all over the country are studying with great interest a new set of cultivation methods created by Maltsev of the "Lenin's Legacy" Collective Farm in the Shadrinsky district of the Kurgan region on an exhibition platform here. Zhukov, the chief agronomist of the Komsomol Machine Tractor Station in the Kurgan region, also held a forum with visitors to discuss this new cultivation technology and answered questions raised by visitors. Exhibits introducing the situation and advanced experience of reclaiming wasteland in the Ural, Siberia, and Kazakhstan exhibition halls particularly attract the attention of the audience. Agronomists, tractor drivers, and collective farm members from these regions who participated in the exhibition introduced to visitors the experience of achieving bumper harvests on newly reclaimed land. Some graduates of higher agricultural schools who are willing to participate in the reclamation work in the eastern region also came to these exhibition halls to visit and study.

The Soviet Agricultural Exhibition has recently continued to add various new exhibits. Trains brought new "Voutz-24" row-crop diesel tractors from Vladimir City. Airplanes brought newly harvested apples, apricots, tomatoes, vegetables, and wheat from the Ukrainian, Latvian Republics, and Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Republic. The "Potato and Vegetable Exhibition Hall" displayed corn stalks up to four meters high for silage, newly sent from the famous "Forest Clearing" State Farm.

    苏联农业展览会继续增加新内容
    外国代表团前往参观的已有一百多个
    【新华社莫斯科二十三日电】苏联农业展览会开幕三周以来，参观者已达一百五十万人左右。已有一百多个外国代表团参观了展览会。展览会采取引导参观、讲演、座谈、表演、放映电影等方式，来宣传苏联社会主义农业的巨大成就和先进经验。
    最近几天来，在展览会的各个展览馆和展览地段上，到处都可以看到来自苏联各地的农业劳动者积极学习各种先进经验的场面。在“农艺展览馆”的一个专门介绍先进播种方法的大厅内，参观者学习了谷物的窄行播种法和交叉播种法，以及栽种马铃薯和蔬菜的正方穴播法和正方播种法。他们还到展览地段上实地参观了用这些方法播种的操作过程。每天到“谷物展览馆”来参观的有一百多个团体。奥勒尔州的农业工作者在这里参观后，决定在他们州内推广尼古拉耶夫州巴什坦斯克区的交叉斜播法。巴什坦斯克区用这种先进方法播种，一九五二年每公顷收获了二十七点七公担冬小麦。
      “乌拉尔展览馆”最近几天来特别拥挤。从各地来的农业劳动者在这里的一个展览台上，饶有兴趣地研究了库尔干州夏德林区“列宁遗志”集体农庄的马尔采夫所创造的一套新的耕作方法。库尔干州共青团机器拖拉机站的总农艺师茹科夫还和参观者举行座谈会，讨论了这种新的耕作技术，并回答了参观者所提出的问题。乌拉尔、西伯利亚和哈萨克等展览馆中介绍开垦荒地的情况和先进经验的展览品，特别吸引观众的注意。从这些地区来参加展览会的农艺师、拖拉机手和集体农庄庄员，向参观者介绍了在新开垦的土地上取得丰收的经验。有些愿意参加东部地区开垦工作的高等农业学校的毕业生，也到这些展览馆来参观学习。
    苏联农业展览会最近仍在增加各种新的展览品。火车从乌拉季米尔城运来了新式的“伍特兹—二四”式中耕用柴油拖拉机。飞机从乌克兰、拉脱维亚共和国和卡巴尔达自治共和国运来了新收获的苹果、杏子、番茄、蔬菜和小麦。“马铃薯和蔬菜展览馆”陈列了新从著名的“林中旷野”国营农场送来的茎秆高达四公尺的作青储用的玉蜀黍。
