    Thirty-three Chinese literary and art workers sent a telegram on August 1st to congratulate Comrade Dennis, General Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, on his fiftieth birthday. The text of the telegram is as follows:
    To Comrade Dennis, Federal Penitentiary, Atlanta, Georgia, USA:
    As you spend your fiftieth birthday in a dungeon-like prison set up by the American reactionaries, we, the literary and art workers of China, extend to you our highest respect and heartfelt condolences for your outstanding contributions to the working class and the cause of democracy and peace, and for your heroic spirit of persevering in struggle in prison! We understand the significance of striving for the freedom of you and other victims of the Smith Act in promoting the movement within the United States against fascism, against the bellicose "policy of strength," and for the defense of world peace. Therefore, we are joining with people all over the world in demanding that the U.S. government immediately cease its brutal persecution of you and other political prisoners. Please take care of your health for the cause of the people and human progress, and wish you a long life!
