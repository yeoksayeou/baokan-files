The Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government has transferred a large amount of rice from Southwest, Northeast, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other places to supply the people in the flood-stricken areas of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other provinces as food. At the same time, buckwheat and other late-season crop seeds are being transferred from Northeast, North China, Inner Mongolia, East China, and other places to supply the disaster areas. At present, the food departments in the affected areas are also vigorously supplying food under the leadership of the local CCP committees and people's governments. In lightly affected areas of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces, food departments are simplifying supply procedures as much as possible to facilitate grain purchases by disaster victims. In severely affected areas, such as those surrounded by water, people are dispatched by boat to deliver food to their doorsteps. Temporary supply stations are also set up on embankments and in areas where disaster victims are concentrated, or mobile supply teams are organized, equipped with wooden boats, steamers, mules, and horses to transport the grain needed by the workers engaged in flood prevention and dike repair in a timely manner.

While transferring seeds, the food departments in various localities are also organizing the national grain market to regulate the supply of seeds, so that farmers in disaster areas can replant in a timely manner and strive for a bumper harvest of late autumn crops. The Food Department of the Hunan Provincial People's Government has transferred a large amount of seeds to the areas in need of seeds. Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and other provinces have also made specific arrangements for seed supply.

       The people of Sichuan are actively transferring large quantities of rice, potatoes, and broad beans to support the flood-stricken areas of Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces. In July alone, the amount of disaster relief rice transported via the Yangtze River to Hankou, Anqing, and other places reached 37,000 tons. Recently, in order to help farmers in disaster areas solve the difficulties in planting late autumn crops, Youyang, Xiushan, Wanxian, Fuling, Nanchong, and other places have concentrated 64 million catties of rice, potato, and broad bean seeds, which are now being transported eastward along the Sichuan River and the Sichuan-Hunan Highway by thousands of cars, ships, and wooden boats. With the active assistance of the masses, the Daxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased 5 million catties of potatoes in a very short period of time. At present, the CCP committees and people's governments at all levels in Sichuan Province are dispatching cadres and taking various effective measures to ensure the completion of the task of timely support for the disaster areas.

    国家调拨粮食和种籽支援水灾区
    大批大米、马铃薯、胡豆由四川源源东运
    中央人民政府粮食部已从西南、东北和广东、广西等地调出大批大米，供给湖南、湖北、江苏、安徽、浙江等省水灾地区的人民作为食粮，同时从东北、华北、内蒙古、华东等地调运荞麦和其他晚季作物的种籽供应灾区。目前受灾地区的粮食部门也正在当地中共地方党委和人民政府领导下，大力供应粮食。湖北、湖南、江西、安徽等地粮食部门在轻灾地区尽量简化供应手续，以便利灾民购粮。在重灾地区，如被水包围的地方，就派人驾船将粮食送到门前。在圩堤上和灾民集居的地方，还设立了临时供应站或组织流动供应组，并配备木船、火轮、骡马等运输工具，及时供应防汛修堤的民工所需要的粮食。
    各地粮食部门在调运种籽的同时，并组织国家粮食市场进行种籽的调剂工作，使灾区农民能适时补种，争取晚秋作物丰收。湖南省人民政府粮食厅已调运大批种籽到各需要种籽的地区。湖北、江西、安徽等省对种籽供应工作也作了具体布置。

       四川人民积极调运大批大米、马铃薯、胡豆支援湖南、安徽等省遭受水灾地区。七月份，仅经长江运往汉口、安庆等地的救灾米，即达三万七千吨。最近为了帮助灾区农民解决播种晚秋作物的困难，酉阳、秀山、万县、涪陵、南充等地又集中了六千四百万斤大米和马铃薯、胡豆种籽，现正用千百辆汽车、轮船、木船沿川江和川湘公路源源东运。达县供销合作社在群众积极协助下，用很短的时间就收购马铃薯五百万斤。目前，四川省各级中共党委和人民政府正抽派干部，采取各种有效措施，来保证完成及时支援灾区的任务。
