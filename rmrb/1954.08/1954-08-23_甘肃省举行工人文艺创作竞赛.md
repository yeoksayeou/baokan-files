In order to encourage workers' literary and artistic creation, the Gansu Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Lanzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Preparatory Committee of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles jointly launched the second Gansu Province Workers' Literary and Artistic Creation Competition. In addition to the grassroots trade unions of various factories and mines being responsible for organizing the recommendation of works, the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles also sent cadres to ten industrial and mining units to provide specific guidance. Workers from various factories and mines actively participated in this competition, and there were 166 entries of various literary and artistic forms. After evaluation, a total of 27 manuscripts were selected, including four first-prize winners such as the novel "Two Nephews"; twelve second-prize winners such as "Our Factory" (clapper talk); and eleven third-prize winners such as "The Revival of the Thomson Electric Furnace" (short story).
