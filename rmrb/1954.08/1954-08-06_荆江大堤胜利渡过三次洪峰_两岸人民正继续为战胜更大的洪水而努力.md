Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 5th: The Jingjiang Dike, which protects the lives and property of the vast people of the Jianghan Plain, has successfully withstood three consecutive flood peaks this year. Currently, under the leadership of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion and Flood Control Headquarters, the people on both banks of the Jingjiang River are continuing their efforts to overcome even greater floods.

This year, due to the early rainy season, abundant rainfall, and large rainfall in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the first flood peak reached Jingjiang in early July. Thanks to the active inspection and reinforcement of the dike by the local people under the leadership of the Party committees and people's governments at all levels, the first flood peak was safely passed on July 9th. Subsequently, the people on both sides of the Jingjiang River further organized a flood control army of more than 100,000 people, led by thousands of cadres, to patrol the Jingjiang Dike and the surrounding dikes of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area day and night, braving the wind and rain. In mid-to-late July, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River experienced several consecutive days of heavy rain, causing the water level to rise sharply and the momentum to be fierce. The second and third flood peaks of the Yangtze River followed one after another. On the morning of July 22nd, the water level in Shashi reached as high as 44.39 meters. At this time, the huge Taipingkou Flood Gate at the northern end of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area was opened for flood diversion for the first time. The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project played a significant role in eliminating the second flood peak. Shortly after the gate was opened, the Jingjiang water level dropped, rendering the subsequent third flood peak powerless. The vast flood control army, disregarding their own safety, braved the rain to rescue dangerous sections, engaging in a life-and-death struggle with the flood. Deng Jinlong, a cadre and member of the Youth League of the Public Security Bureau of Jianli County, was on duty at the Xiaodongmen dry dike in Jianli County. Due to the severe impact of the turbulent waves on the dike body, causing it to collapse, piling was required. Deng Jinlong immediately went into the water to hold the wooden piles and directed the workers to drive the piles with hammers. Due to his persistence for too long, he was exhausted and pushed out of the water by the waves, unfortunately being injured and falling unconscious by the hammer. After regaining consciousness, when others comforted him, he said: "My injury is not serious, rescuing the dike is the most important thing." He immediately returned to the dike. Thanks to the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and the rescue efforts of the vast people, the second and third flood peaks of the Jingjiang River were successfully overcome by the end of July.

Now, the Jingjiang water level is rising again, and the flood control army on both banks of the Jingjiang River is making persistent efforts to overcome the next flood peak. Meetings have been widely held in each dike section's labor teams to summarize the experience of the previous stage of flood control and rescue and to learn advanced working methods. After realizing the significant relationship between protecting the Jingjiang Dike and the country's construction of a socialist society, the vast flood control personnel are even more enthusiastic about flood control. The workers in Jingsha Township, Jiangling County, originally planned for 300 people to complete 300 cubic meters of earthwork in one day, but 250 people completed 359 cubic meters of earthwork in ten hours. At present, more than 30,000 cubic meters of earth have been prepared on the Jingjiang Dike and the surrounding dikes of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area for emergency use. A large number of flood control materials supported by the Northeast, Southwest and other parts of the country have also been transported to the construction site, including more than 720,000 sacks and straw bags alone.

### 荆江大堤胜利渡过三次洪峰  两岸人民正继续为战胜更大的洪水而努力

    荆江大堤胜利渡过三次洪峰
    两岸人民正继续为战胜更大的洪水而努力
    【新华社武汉五日电】捍卫着江汉平原广大人民生命财产的荆江大堤，今年已胜利渡过了接连涌来的三次洪峰。目前，荆江两岸人民在荆江分洪防汛指挥部领导下，正继续努力，为战胜更大的洪水而努力。
    今年由于长江中游雨季早、雨水多、雨量大，第一次洪峰在七月上旬就到达荆江。由于当地人民在中共各级党委和人民政府领导下，事先积极检修并加固了大堤，第一次洪峰在七月九日便安全渡过。接着荆江两岸人民进一步组织了十多万人的防汛大军，在成千的干部率领下，星夜冒着风雨巡守荆江大堤和对岸的荆江分洪区围堤。七月中、下旬长江中游接连数日暴雨，水位升高，来势凶猛，长江第二次洪峰和第三次洪峰接踵而下。七月二十二日晨，沙市水位高达四四点三九公尺，这时荆江分洪区北端巨大的太平口进洪闸第一次开闸分洪。 荆江分洪工程对消灭第二次洪峰发挥了巨大作用，开闸后不久，即使荆江水位下降，并使接着而来的第三次洪峰无能为力。广大防汛大军奋不顾身地冒雨抢救险工险段，和洪水展开了生死斗争。监利县公安局干部青年团员邓金龙在监利县城小东门干堤防汛中，由于部分堤身被狂浪冲击崩坍，情况严重，需要打桩，邓金龙当即下水扶着木桩并指挥民工用榔头打桩。由于他坚持时间过长，精疲力竭被江浪托出水面，不幸被榔头打伤昏倒了。苏醒过来后，别人慰问他时，他说：“我伤得不重，抢救大堤要紧。”马上又回到了堤上。由于荆江分洪工程的作用和广大人民的抢救，荆江的第二次和第三次洪峰到七月底即胜利渡过。
    现在，荆江水位又在回涨，荆江两岸的防汛大军正再接再厉为战胜再一次的洪峰而努力。各堤段民工队都普遍召开了会议，总结前一阶段防汛抢险的经验，学习先进的工作方法。广大防汛人员认识到保护荆江大堤和国家建设社会主义社会的重大关系后，防汛热情更加高涨。江陵县荆沙乡的民工，原计划三百人一天完成三百方土，结果二百五十人在十小时内即完成了三百五十九方土。目前荆江大堤和荆江分洪区围堤已准备好三万多公方土以备抢险之用。东北、西南等全国各地支援来的大批防汛器材也已运抵工地，其中仅麻袋草包即达七十二万多条。
