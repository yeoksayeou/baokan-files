The early rice harvest in Guangdong Province is nearing completion. Agricultural production cooperatives across the province that have completed harvesting generally report increases of over 20%, with the highest exceeding last year's yield by more than double. Farmers organized throughout the region have further recognized the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation from this year's bumper early rice harvest. Currently, spurred by the abundant early rice harvest this year, members of agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province have further increased their production enthusiasm and are striving for an even greater harvest in the next season. Their achievements will become a huge driving force for the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas throughout the country.

The picture above shows the Qunlian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Maba Township, Qujiang County, Guangdong Province, displaying the spirit of collective labor, cooperating and dividing tasks in an orderly manner during the summer harvest.

This year, the early rice yield of the Qunlian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Maba Township, Qujiang County, increased by 33% compared to last year. The cooperative used its public accumulation fund to buy two oxen back from the supply and marketing cooperative.

Before the summer harvest, farmers visited the Qunlian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Maba Township and, upon seeing the plump rice grains cultivated by the cooperative using advanced farming techniques, expressed their intention to organize and improve their production techniques upon returning.

The Xiongxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Second District of Xinhui County built a large embankment 70 zhang long and 1.2 zhang wide to increase grain production, turning 80 mu of outer tidal land into fertile fields suitable for planting double-cropping rice.

Agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives have placed the farmers' economy on the track of national planning through the signing of "integration contracts" for supply, production, and sales, preventing farmers from being subjected to the intermediate exploitation of private merchants. This is the Lianxi Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Ninth District of Xinhui County signing an "integration contract" with the district's supply and marketing cooperative.

Liu Xiulin's family in the Maba Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qujiang County has seven laborers. Before joining the cooperative, their early rice harvest was only 4,180 jin of rice. After this year's summer harvest, the cooperative distributed 7,276 jin of rice to them, an increase of more than 3,000 jin compared to last year.

In order to support national industrial construction, many agricultural production cooperatives took the lead in selling surplus grain to the state after the summer harvest. On July 11, the Maba Grain Purchasing Station in Qujiang County purchased more than 110,000 jin of grain in one day.

The Qianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hesheng Township, Third District of Zhongshan County, achieved a great early rice harvest. The high-yield fields with close planting yielded more than 700 jin per mu. This is a picture of members of the cooperative transporting the harvested early rice home by boat.

In order to ensure a bountiful harvest after converting single-season rice sandy fields to double-season rice, the Qianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative adopted new methods of harvesting, plowing, and planting immediately. This is a picture of the cooperative members planting rice closely on the sandy fields plowed and harrowed after the summer harvest. Xinhua News Agency, Xue Zijiang

    曲江县马坝乡群联农业生产合作社今年早稻比去年增产百分之三十三。社里用公积金从供销合作社买回了两头耕牛。
    夏收前，农民群众到马坝乡群联农业生产合作社参观，看见该社采用先进耕作技术栽培出来的水稻颗粒饱满，都表示回去要组织起来，改进生产技术。
    新会县二区雄乡农业生产合作社为了增加粮食生产量，修筑了一条长七十丈、阔一丈二尺的大围堤，使八十亩外坦田变成可种双季稻的良田。
    农业生产合作社与供销合作社通过订立供、产、销的“结合合同”，把农民经济纳入国家计划的轨道，并使农民不受私商的中间剥削。这是新会县九区莲溪乡农业生产合作社与该区供销合作社正在签订“结合合同”。
    曲江县马坝乡农业生产合作社社员刘秀林一户七个劳动力，未入社前早稻只收四千一百八十市斤谷，今年夏收后，社里分配给他的是七千二百七十六市斤谷，比去年增加三千多斤谷的收入。
    为了支援国家工业建设，许多农业生产合作社在夏收后都带头卖余粮给国家。曲江县马坝粮食收购站在七月十一日一天内，即收购到粮食十一万余市斤。
    中山县三区合胜乡前锋农业生产合作社早稻获得大丰收，小科密植的丰产田每亩产量达七百斤以上。这是该社社员把收割的早稻一船一船地运回家来。 新华社稿　薛子江摄

    为了使单季稻沙田改种双季稻后保证获得丰收，前锋农业生产合作社采用即割、即耕、即插的新方法进行夏种。这是该社社员在夏收后犁耙过的沙田上进行小科密植插秧。新华社稿　薛子江摄
