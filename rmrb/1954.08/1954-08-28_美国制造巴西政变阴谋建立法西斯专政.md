Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, August 26th: Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas committed suicide on the 24th and Vice President João Café Filho has assumed the presidency. Vargas's cabinet has submitted its resignation to the new president.

According to a United Press report, Vargas pointed out in his suicide note that "international economic and financial groups" have long ruled and exploited Brazil, and denounced the "international groups" for colluding with domestic anti-Vargas forces to conspire against his regime. The note mentioned that the Brazilian government's measures "in oil and electricity" during the past period "were opposed by foreign countries," and also mentioned that under the pressure of foreign violence, it had to lower coffee prices, thus causing Brazil's "coffee crisis."

Brazil’s "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 21st regarding the situation in Brazil. The editorial stated: "The most reactionary forces serving U.S. imperialism are attempting a sinister blow against Brazil, striving to establish a fascist dictatorship. Conspiracies against the Brazilian people are being plotted to allow American giants to further colonize Brazil, intensify the exploitation of the masses, and obstruct the election of patriots and the elections to be held on October 3." The editorial also said: "The elements advocating a coup d'état are intensifying their conspiracy methods under the leadership of the U.S. Embassy recently..."

The pro-American Brazilian "Correio da Manhã" published a meaningful message on the 18th, saying that U.S. Ambassador to Brazil James Kemper visited Brazilian Vice President João Café Filho and, on behalf of the U.S. government, invited him to visit the United States. The message stated: "Many events may occur" from the time Filho accepts the invitation until he departs, "especially likely" is that he will "change from Vice President of Brazil to President."

According to a United Press report, not long before Vargas's suicide, senior generals of the Brazilian army held a secret meeting to discuss whether to replace Vargas. Afterwards, the Brazilian government issued a communiqué saying that Brazilian President Vargas, after holding a meeting with his cabinet members, "decided to take a vacation" for ninety days, and the presidential duties were handed over to Vice President João Café Filho. However, as soon as this communiqué was released, Brazilian radio stations immediately broadcast that Vargas had committed suicide.

    美国制造巴西政变阴谋建立法西斯专政
    【新华社二十六日讯】里约热内卢消息：巴西总统杰土略·瓦加斯二十四日自杀身死，总统遗职由副总统若奥·卡菲·菲洛继任，瓦加斯内阁已经向新总统提出辞呈。
    据合众社报道，瓦加斯在遗书中指出了“国际经济和金融集团”对巴西进行长期统治和剥削，斥责“国际集团”勾结国内反瓦加斯的势力阴谋反对他的政权。遗书谈到在以往一段时间内巴西政府“在石油和电力方面”的措施“遭到国外反对”，也谈到在外国强暴的压力下不得不降低咖啡价格，因而造成巴西的“咖啡危机”。
    巴西“人民报”二十一日曾就巴西情况发表社论，社论写道：“为美帝国主义服务的最反动的势力企图对巴西进行一次罪恶的打击，力图建立法西斯专政。反对巴西人民的阴谋正在策划中，以便让美国巨头进一步使巴西殖民地化，加强对群众的剥削，阻挠选举爱国者和在十月三日举行的选举。”社论又说：“主张政变的分子最近在美国大使馆的领导下，在加紧他们的阴谋手段……。”
    亲美的巴西“晨邮报”十八日登载了一条意味深长的消息说：美国驻巴西大使詹姆斯·凯泼曾访问巴西副总统若奥·卡菲·菲洛，并代表美国政府邀请他访问美国。消息说：从菲洛接受邀请到他动身的期间内“可能发生许多事件”，“特别可能的”是他将“从巴西副总统变为总统”。
    又据合众社消息说，在瓦加斯自杀之前不久，巴西军队的高级将领开了一次秘密会议，这次会议讨论要不要撤换瓦加斯。之后，巴西政府曾发表公报说，巴西总统瓦加斯在和他的内阁阁员举行会议后“决定休假”九十天，总统职务交给副总统若奥·卡菲·菲洛。但是，这一公报刚刚发布，巴西无线电台随即广播说，瓦加斯已经自杀了。
