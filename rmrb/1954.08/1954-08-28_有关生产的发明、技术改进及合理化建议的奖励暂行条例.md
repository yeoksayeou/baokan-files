    If the savings value caused by an invention exceeds the first year in the years after adoption, it shall be calculated based on the actual effect each year.
    Article 20 For suggestions with an adoption period of less than one year, the savings value shall be calculated based on the actual adoption time. In enterprises with seasonal production, the savings value shall be calculated based on the seasonal period. For suggestions related only to a one-time temporary order, the savings value shall be calculated based on the plan for that batch of orders. For suggestions related to the repair of one or several pieces of machinery and equipment, the savings value shall be calculated based on the actual number of pieces repaired.
    Article 21 Any increase in expenditure in this department or other production departments during the implementation of inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals shall be deducted from the savings value.

    Article 23 For suggestions that increase equipment utilization, improve machine efficiency, or change machine and equipment repair methods, the savings value shall be the difference between the annual production cost budget before the adoption of the suggestion and the new budget prepared after the adoption of the suggestion.
    Article 24 For suggestions that reduce or eliminate defective products, the annual savings value shall be determined based on the losses caused by defective products in the six months before the adoption of the suggestion. The defective products to be counted shall only refer to those defective products that are eliminated after the adoption of the suggestion.
    Article 25 For suggestions that can reduce the cost of a construction project, the annual savings value shall be calculated at 20 percent of the total cost reduction after the suggestion is implemented.
    Article 26 The calculation of the savings value shall be carried out within 30 days from the date the plan for adopting the invention, technological improvement, or rationalization proposal is approved. After the calculation, a notice of adoption of the suggestion and a calculation sheet of the savings value and bonus payable due to the adoption of the suggestion shall be issued to the suggester.
    Article 27 Bonuses for inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals shall be paid in installments: For those less than 3 million yuan, the bonus shall be paid within three months; for those above 3 million yuan, 25 percent of the bonus shall be paid within three months, another 25 percent shall be paid after six months, and the remaining 50 percent shall be paid within two months after the suggestion has been adopted for twelve months.
    Article 28 The payment methods for collective invention, technological improvement, and rationalization proposal bonuses are as follows:
    A. For inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals jointly completed by several people, the bonus distribution method shall be jointly decided by all personnel participating in the suggestion.

If an invention, technological improvement, or rationalization proposal was not adopted at first, but was adopted after a supplementary suggestion was made, and the supplementary suggestion was made by another person, the distribution of bonuses between the two persons shall be determined based on the magnitude of each person's suggestion.
    Article 29 If an invention, technological improvement, or rationalization proposal is only adopted within one enterprise and the bonus is less than 3 million yuan, it shall be calculated and issued by the enterprise itself. If the bonus is above 3 million yuan, it shall be issued after being reviewed and approved by the higher-level authority. If it is jointly adopted by various enterprises under the jurisdiction of an economic department management bureau or by more than one enterprise, the bonus shall be calculated and issued by the management bureau. If it is jointly adopted by several enterprises under the jurisdiction of various bureaus under an economic department, the bonus shall be calculated and issued by the department. If the adoption extends to the national scope, the bonus shall be calculated by the various departments adopting the suggestion and reported to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for verification and allocation.
    Article 30 For research and experimental plans related to inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals that are deemed to be of great significance by the competent authorities at all levels, research and experimental funds may be allocated, and the amount of funds shall be decided and paid by the competent authorities at all levels, and the technical department shall receive and assist the original suggester in conducting research and experimentation.
