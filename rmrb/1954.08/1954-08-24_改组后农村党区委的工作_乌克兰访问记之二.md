The Work of Rural Party District Committees After Reorganization
--A Visit to Ukraine, Part Two
By our reporter Li He

In the White Church District of the Kyiv region, we personally witnessed how the rural party district committees strengthened their leadership over agriculture after the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party last year.

The White Church District is located 100 kilometers south of Kyiv, with asphalt roads leading to it. We traveled by car and returned on the same day. The convenient transportation between the Ukrainian countryside and cities could be seen everywhere during our trip.

We arrived early at the district center, but the First Secretary of the Party District Committee, G.A. Tkachenko, had already gone to the countryside. We found him at a collective farm. He was leading representatives from two collective farms engaged in socialist competition to inspect livestock farms and fields. After entrusting this task to the Second Secretary, he took us back to the district center.

Comrade Tkachenko has been the District Committee Secretary since 1937. He is now serving his eighth year as the District Committee Secretary in the White Church District. He shared his experiences on how to be a good District Committee Secretary. He said: The First Secretary is responsible for overall leadership, but should not make decisions alone; decisions should be made collectively. He should not say, like a factory director, "I decide…," but rather, "We decide…". Of course, not everything needs to be discussed in meetings; some things can be discussed briefly over the phone. The production of collective farms or state farms, the construction of hydropower stations, and the party education in the district should be discussed at the District Committee Standing Committee meetings, which are held three times a month. Major issues such as spring planting preparations and harvest preparations should be discussed at the District Committee plenary meetings, which are held every three months. He said: The District Committee Secretary should carefully study the Party Central Committee's resolutions, the Provincial Committee's resolutions and instructions, and relevant articles published in newspapers. He must be familiar with the conditions in his district in order to plan and arrange the work, and focus his main efforts on concrete inspection of the work. On the day we met him, he personally went to a machine tractor station and two collective farms to check the condition of the crops after the heavy rain. He said: The most important point in leadership work is what the Party has always taught us – to learn from the masses, listen to opinions and criticisms from all sides, and never be arrogant. He said thoughtfully: Arrogance will prevent you from doing the Party's work well; if the Party's current work is not done well, past achievements cannot be relied upon. In Tkachenko, we understood that working in a specific position for a relatively long time is an important way for Party workers to accumulate experience.

We already knew in Kyiv that, precisely because of the attention paid to the Party's work, the White Church District completed spring planting earlier than other districts and met technical standards. In response to the Party's call to increase agricultural production, the White Church District used 125,000 tons of organic fertilizer in 1954, 30,000 tons more than in 1953, and the mineral fertilizer applied per hectare also increased from 200 kilograms to 400 kilograms; corn, potatoes, and vegetables all adopted advanced square cluster planting.

Like rural party district committees throughout the Soviet Union, the White Church District Party Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, reorganized its structure and selected comrades with party work experience and relatively high political levels to form two district committee work groups (instructor groups) to lead the areas served by machine tractor stations, including one District Committee Secretary and three instructors each. Each instructor in the work group is responsible for three, four, or five collective farms. The work groups do not reside in the District Committee offices, but live directly at the machine tractor stations. The important significance of this reorganization, which is widely implemented throughout the Soviet Union, lies in its ability to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being specifically responsible for the leadership of machine tractor stations and collective farms, and to replace lifeless bureaucratic leadership methods with on-the-spot, practical, concrete, and therefore effective leadership methods.

N. D. Zivenko, one of the secretaries of the White Church District Party Committee, leads a work group stationed at the White Church Machine Tractor Station. Each tractor (averaging 15 horsepower) at this tractor station cultivated 797 hectares (the plan was 686 hectares). All collective farms it serves harvested an average of 1,500 kilograms of grain per hectare, 20,900 kilograms of sugar beets per hectare, and 2,000 kilograms of milk per cow. The public economy of all collective farms has been strengthened, and the income of farms and the lives of villagers have improved. However, the work group is not satisfied with this average performance. Because whether in tractor stations or collective farms, there are units and people who achieve different results under the same conditions. Therefore, the work group must carefully study the specific situation, tap potential strengths, and pay attention to raising the laggards to the level of the advanced.

The work group first focused its main efforts on improving the work of the tractor station. The work group participated in repairing machines at the tractor station, compiling and rationally using technical and mechanical personnel, and formulating development plans for collective farm production, thereby becoming familiar with the cadres and work of the tractor station. The work of the tractor station's repair shop had shortcomings, especially in labor organization. After discussing with the station director, the work group held a production technology conference to clarify the root causes of the shortcomings. Subsequently, the work of the chief engineer of the tractor station was heard and criticized at the Party's open meeting, and a decision was made to accelerate repairs and improve repair quality. After some time, the implementation of the decision was checked. It was found that the secretary of the tractor station's Party branch had a phenomenon of relying on the work group and relaxing his responsibilities, and the station director did not actively try to improve the work. Thus, the issue was raised to the District Committee Standing Committee. The District Committee Standing Committee clearly pointed out their duties and relationships. According to the Party Constitution, the Party branch of the tractor station must supervise administrative work. The District Committee Secretary leading the work group maintains close contact with the station director and branch secretary in principle, guides and helps them, but never replaces them at any time.

The strengthening of technical cadres in the Soviet countryside can also be seen in the White Church District. All thirteen collective farms served by the White Church Machine Tractor Station now have agronomists, nine of whom have livestock technicians. The work group strives to make these technical cadres true organizers of collective farm production, while caring about their living conditions and improving their knowledge and professional skills. With the help of these technical cadres, the technical level of farming and animal husbandry in the collective farms in 1954 has been improved. However, when analyzing the reasons why some technical cadres have not fulfilled their responsibilities, the work group noted that since the technical personnel became tractor station cadres working in the collective farm, problems have arisen in supervising their work. It is difficult for the tractor station cadres and party organizations to know the work of a technical person in a certain collective farm every day, and the collective farm management and party organizations believe that they have no right to supervise the staff of the tractor station. The work group raised the issue of improving the work of technical cadres and raising their sense of responsibility to the District Committee for research. Later, the District Committee staff talked to the technical cadres more, offering opinions. The collective farm management department often listened to the reports of technical cadres. The collective farm party organization has a deeper understanding of the activities of technical personnel, invites them to participate in party congresses, and points out the shortcomings of their work. The tractor station party organization requires the chief agronomist, chief livestock technician, and veterinary director to strengthen the leadership of the technical cadres under their jurisdiction. In this way, with the urging of all parties, the work of technical cadres has been greatly improved.

After the District Committee strengthened the Party branches of the collective farms with more cultivated and experienced secretaries, the work group strived to improve the role of these branches. It helps the branch secretary correctly arrange the communists in decisive production positions, help adjust the party's work plan, help prepare and carry out the party's meetings, help supervise the implementation of resolutions, and help supervise the work of the collective farm management. The work group conducts its work through instructors. For example: Instructor Arshibenko is responsible for the Dimitrov Collective Farm. This collective farm has a very good feed production area, but the amount of milk produced is still lower than those collective farms with poor feed conditions. After studying on the spot, Arshibenko knew that this was due to the poor labor organization of the livestock farm, the lack of necessary explanation work among the livestock villagers, and the collective farm party organization rarely asked about the development of animal husbandry. This instructor stayed in this collective farm for eight days and vigorously helped the party branch. At his suggestion, the issue of increasing milk production was discussed at an open party member congress. The meeting was well prepared and came up with many solutions. After the meeting, a forum was held with the livestock villagers. The Communists took the lead in launching a competition between the livestock farms and the milkmaid villagers. A new work system was implemented. The milk production results are announced daily. The amount of milk squeezed more than doubled in two months.

According to I. Shtoz, the district committee secretary leading another work group: The work group has a work plan every month. This plan is formulated in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's decision, the instructions of the superiors, and the specific situation in the countryside, and is implemented after being approved by the District Committee Standing Committee. Previously, the District Committee held three standing committee meetings and one plenary meeting every month, with many meeting reports. After the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, it was greatly reduced. In this way, the District Committee staff has more time to go to the collective farms. Not just for an hour or two, but for a day or two or even longer, in order to carefully understand the situation and concretely solve problems. He feels that the leadership is now closer to the lower levels.

Conducting living, concrete leadership on the spot – this spirit of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party is increasingly implemented in the Soviet countryside, playing a clear decisive influence on the further development of agriculture.

    改组后农村党区委的工作
    ——乌克兰访问记之二
    本报记者　李何
    在基辅州白庙区，我们实地认识了在苏共中央去年九月全会以后，农村党区委会加强对农业的领导的情形。
    白庙区在基辅南面一百公里，有柏油公路通达。我们乘汽车当天来回。乌克兰农村与城市之间交通的捷便，在以后我们的旅途中随处可以见到。
    我们一早赶到区中心，党区委会第一书记格·阿·特卡钦科已经下乡了。我们在一个集体农庄找到了他。他正带领两个进行社会主义竞赛的集体农庄的代表们检查饲畜场和田间。把这项工作托付给第二书记后，他把我们带回区中心。
    特卡钦科同志从一九三七年起就当区委书记。他在白庙区现在当第八年的区委书记。对于怎样做好区委书记工作，他谈了自己的体验。他说：第一书记负责全面领导，但逢事不能一个人决定，而要集体决定；他不应像工厂厂长那样说：“我决定……，”只应说：“我们决定……”。当然不是大小事情都要开会讨论，有些事只需要在电话上商量一下。集体农庄或国营农场的生产，水电站建筑的进行，区的党课教育，诸如此类问题，要在每月三次的区委常委会上讨论。而像春播准备、收割准备等等重大问题，要在每三个月一次的区委全会上讨论。他说：区委书记要很好地研究党中央的决议、州委会的决议和指示、报纸上发表的有关事物，要熟悉本区的情况，才好计划和布置本区的工作，而把主要力量放在具体地检查工作上面。在会见我们的那一天，他亲自到一个机器拖拉机站和两个集体农庄察看大雨后庄稼的情形。他说：领导工作中最重要的一点，就是党所一直教训我们的——要向群众学习，听取各方面的意见和批评，切不可骄傲。他深思地说：骄傲就做不好党的工作；党的现在工作做不好，已往的成绩就靠不住。在特卡钦科身上，我们领会到党的工作者在一定的岗位比较长期的工作，是积累经验的一个重要方法。
    我们在基辅已经知道，正是由于注意党的工作，白庙区比别区先完成春播，并且合乎技术标准。为了响应党的提高农业生产的号召，白庙区一九五四年用了十二万五千吨有机肥料，比一九五三年多三万吨，每公顷所施的矿质肥料也从二百公斤增加到四百公斤；玉米、马铃薯、蔬菜全部都采用先进的方形簇种。
    和苏联各地农村党区委会一样，白庙区党区委会按照苏共中央九月全会的指示，改组了机构，挑选了有党的工作经验、政治水平比较高的同志，组成两个领导机器拖拉机站所服务地带的区委工作组（指导员组），包括区委书记各一人和指导员各三人。工作组的每个指导员负责三、四、五个集体农庄。工作组不住在区委会机关，直接住在机器拖拉机站。这种全苏联各地普遍实行的改组的重要意义，在于它能够消灭无人对机器拖拉机站和集体农庄领导负专责的现象，能够以就地实际的具体的因而有效的领导方法，代替没有生气的文牍主义的领导方法。
    纳·德紫文科，白庙区区委书记之一，带领的工作组驻在白庙机器拖拉机站。这个拖拉机站的每台拖拉机（平均十五匹马力）耕了七百九十七公顷
  （计划是六百八十六公顷）。它所服务的所有集体农庄平均每公顷谷物地收获了一千五百公斤，每公顷甜菜地收获了二万零九百公斤，每头母牛挤了二千公斤牛奶。所有集体农庄的公有经济加强了，农庄收入和庄员生活提高了。但是工作组不满足于这种平均的成绩。因为不论在拖拉机站还是集体农庄，都有单位和人们在相同条件下作出不同的成绩。因此工作组要很好地研究具体情况，发掘潜在力量，注意把落后者提高到先进者水平。
    工作组首先把主要力量放在改进拖拉机站的工作上。在拖拉机站修理机器，编制和合理使用技术和机械人员，拟订集体农庄生产的发展计划时，工作组都参加了，从而熟悉了拖拉机站的干部和工作。拖拉机站的修理厂的工作有缺点，特别是在劳动组织方面。工作组和站长商量后，举行了生产技术会议，弄清缺点的根源。随后在党的公开会议上听取和批评了拖拉机站总工程师的工作，作出了加快修理和提高修理质量的决定。过些时候，检查了决定执行的情形。发现了拖拉机站党支部书记有依赖工作组而放松自己的责任的现象，站长也没有积极设法改进工作。于是问题提到区委常委会上。区委常委会明确地指出了他们的职责和关系。拖拉机站的党支部按党章要对行政工作进行监督。领导工作组的区委书记，和拖拉机站站长、支部书记保持有原则的密切接触，指导和帮助他们，但任何时候也不代替他们。
    苏联农村技术干部的加强，在白庙区也可以看到。白庙机器拖拉机站所服务的十三个集体农庄现在都有农艺师，其中九个有饲畜技师。工作组争取使这些技术干部成为集体农庄生产的真正组织者，同时关心他们的生活条件，提高他们的知识和业务能力。在这些技术干部帮助下，各集体农庄在一九五四年农作和饲畜的技术水平提高了。但在分析某些技术干部没有尽责的原因的时候，工作组注意到了，自从技术人员变为在集体农庄工作的拖拉机站干部以后，对他们工作的监督发生了问题。拖拉机站干部和党组织很难每天知道某一集体农庄某一技术人员的工作，而集体农庄管理部和党组织又认为自己没有权监督拖拉机站的工作人员。工作组把改进技术干部的工作和提高他们的责任心问题提到区委会上研究。后来，区委会工作人员更多地找技术干部谈话，提供意见。集体农庄管理部会议经常听取技术干部的报告。集体农庄党组织更深入地了解技术人员的活动，邀请他们参加党员大会，指出他们工作的缺点。拖拉机站党组织要求总农艺师、总饲畜师、兽医主任加强领导他们所管辖的技术干部。这样，经过各方面的督促，技术干部的工作大大改善了。
      在区委会以更有修养和经验的书记加强集体农庄的党支部以后，工作组努力提高这些支部的作用。它帮助支部书记把共产党员正确地安排在有决定意义的生产岗位上，帮助调整党的工作计划，帮助准备和进行党的会议，帮助监督决议的执行，帮助监督集体农庄管理部的工作。工作组是经过指导员进行工作的。例如：指导员阿尔喜边科负责季米特洛夫集体农庄。这个集体农庄有很好的饲料产地，但是所产的牛奶量还低于那些饲料情况较差的集体农庄。阿尔喜边科就地研究后，知道这是由于饲畜场劳动组织不善，在饲畜庄员中没有进行必要的解释工作，而集体农庄党组织很少过问饲畜业的发展问题。这个指导员在这个集体农庄住了八天，大力帮助了党支部。根据他的提议，提高牛奶产量问题提到公开的党员大会上讨论。会议经过很好的准备，想出了许多办法。会后同饲畜庄员进行了座谈。共产党员带领发动了各饲畜场之间和各个挤牛奶女庄员之间的竞赛。实行了新的工作制度。每日公布挤牛奶成绩。挤牛奶量两个月中提高了一倍以上。
    据带领另一个工作组的区委书记伊·什托兹谈：工作组每月有工作计划。这个计划根据中央决定的精神、上级的指示和农村的具体情况订出，经过区委常委会批准后执行。以前区委每月举行三次常委会，一次全会，会议报告很多，苏共中央九月全会以后，大大减少了。这样，区委会工作人员有更多时间下到集体农庄去。不只去一两小时，而是去一两天甚至更久，以便仔细了解情况，具体解决问题。他觉得，现在领导是更接近于下层了。
    就地进行活的、具体的领导，——苏共中央九月全会的这个精神，日益贯彻到苏联农村中去，对进一步发展农业起着明显的决定性影响。
