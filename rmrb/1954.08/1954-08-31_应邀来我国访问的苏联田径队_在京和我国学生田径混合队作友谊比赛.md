    Invited to Visit China, the Soviet Track and Field Team
    Holds Friendly Competition with Chinese Student Track and Field Mixed Team in Beijing
    The Soviet track and field team, invited to China by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the Central People's Government, held a friendly competition with the Chinese National Student Track and Field Mixed Team and the Beijing Track and Field Joint Team in Beijing on the afternoon of the 29th. This competition was the last friendly competition of the Soviet track and field team's visit to China. More than 12,000 spectators attended the competition. Government leaders and leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations attending the meeting included Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Deng Xiaoping, Xi Zhongxun, He Long, Cai Tingkai, Fu Zuoyi, Teng Daiyuan, Luo Ruiqing, Li Dequan, Yang Xiufeng, Zeng Zhaolun, Shao Lizi, Luo Longji, Chu Tunan, Liu Zihua, Zhang Ze, Hu Keshi, and Chai Zemin.
    The competition included 25 track and field events, with the Soviet track and field team participating in 12 events. The women's 80-meter hurdles was an exceptionally exciting friendly competition. G. Gogelia, Honored Master of Sports of the Soviet Union, track and field coach of the Tbilisi Dynamo Sports Association, and former Soviet record holder in the 80-meter hurdles, immediately engaged in an intense friendly competition with Li Zhichu, who recently broke the national record for women's low hurdles in Lushun-Dalian. Li Zhichu closely followed Gogelia from the start. As the audience's emotions were running high, Gogelia ultimately won first place with her strong physical strength and skillful technique. Li Zhichu took second place, three seconds behind. Li Zhichu's score was 12.8 seconds. Before the men's javelin competition began, A. Anokina, Honored Master of Sports of the Soviet Union, lecturer at the Leningrad Institute of Physical Culture, and the first Soviet female athlete to set a world javelin record in 1945, appeared on the field, patiently instructing Yu Jin'an and Liu Chengbang, male athletes from the Beijing Track and Field Joint Team. This friendly and enthusiastic instruction won warm applause from the audience. Yu Jin'an and Liu Chengbang, two excellent athletes, recently broke the national record for men's javelin, which had been held for 18 years, in Lushun-Dalian. They alternately won first and second place in the competitions in Lushun-Dalian and Shenyang. The winner of this competition was again one of them. Yu Jin'an won first place with 55.28 meters, and Liu Chengbang took second place with 54.50 meters. The men's 5,000-meter race was a friendly competition with rich educational significance. V. Popov, Honored Master of Sports of the Soviet Union, demonstrated composure, calmness, determination, and skillful long-distance running techniques in the competition. Jin Dinghao of the Beijing Track and Field Joint Team bravely chased Popov from the start and maintained a distance of one meter from him. However, Popov appeared very calm and composed, only accelerating in the last two laps, and won first place with light and agile steps. Jin Dinghao took second place with a time of 15 minutes and 41.2 seconds. The audience applauded Popov's qualities and techniques warmly.
    Within a horseshoe-shaped wire mesh, the hammer throw competition was held. This was a Soviet field event that Beijing audiences had generally not seen before. A. Debenko, the Soviet hammer throw champion, threw the hammer first. The audience watched him with curiosity. He picked up one end of the steel wire attached to the ball, swung the ball over his head several times, then held the wire and spun his body five or six times before releasing the ball in the direction of the throw. The hammer, weighing more than seven kilograms and connected by a steel wire, flew out along a tangent line with the help of centrifugal force, drawing a long parabola in the low sky, landing more than 55 meters away. Chinese athletes Wang Hong and Qu Ruilin followed suit. They had learned the technique from Debenko not long ago in Lushun-Dalian. In this competition, their first throws were not only short in distance but also inaccurate in direction. Debenko patiently instructed them on the spot, which immediately resulted in significant progress. As a result, Wang Hong achieved 26.78 meters, an improvement of 3.155 meters over his performance in the friendly competition in Shenyang. (Xinhua News Agency)

    应邀来我国访问的苏联田径队
    在京和我国学生田径混合队作友谊比赛
    应中央人民政府体育运动委员会邀请来我国访问的苏联田径队，二十九日下午在北京与我国全国学生田径混合队和北京田径联合队举行友谊比赛。这次比赛是苏联田径队在我国访问的最后一次友谊比赛。参加此次友谊比赛的观众共有一万二千多人。参加大会的政府首长和各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人有李济深、郭沫若、邓小平、习仲勋、贺龙、蔡廷锴、傅作义、滕代远、罗瑞卿、李德全、杨秀峰、曾昭抡、邵力子、罗隆基、楚图南、刘子久、章泽、胡克实、柴泽民等人。
    这次比赛共包括二十五个田径赛项目，苏联田径队参加了十二个项目。女子八十公尺低栏是一个异常精采的友谊比赛。苏联功勋运动员、第比利斯狄纳莫体育协会田径教练、曾创苏联八十公尺低栏纪录的戈基耶利一开始就和这次在旅大打破女子低栏全国最高纪录的李治初展开了紧张的友谊竞赛，李治初从起跑后就紧紧跟随着戈基耶利，观众正在情绪高涨的时候，戈基耶利终以坚强的体力和纯熟的技巧获得了第一名，李治初以三秒之差获得了第二名。李治初的成绩是十二秒八。在男子标枪尚未开始比赛时，场地上就出现了苏联功勋运动员、列宁格勒体育学院教员、一九四五年第一个创造世界标枪纪录的苏联女运动员阿诺基娜，她在循循善诱地教导着北京田径联合队的男运动员于金安和刘成邦，这种友谊的、热情的教导博得观众热烈的喝采。于金安和刘成邦这两位优秀的运动员日前在旅大曾打破了保持十八年之久的男子标枪全国最高纪录，他们并在旅大和沈阳的比赛中更替地获得了第一名和第二名，这次比赛的优胜者又是他们。于金安以五十五公尺二十八公分获得了第一名，刘成邦以五十四公尺五十公分获得第二名。男子五千公尺径赛是一场具有丰富教育意义的友谊比赛，苏联功勋运动员波波夫在比赛中显示了沉着、镇静、坚定的品质和纯熟的长跑技巧。北京田径联合队金丁浩自起跑后即奋起追赶波波夫，并且一直和他保持一公尺之隔的距离。但波波夫显得十分镇静安详，在最后两圈才加快速度，用轻快敏捷的步法获得了第一名；金丁浩以十五分四十一秒二的成绩获得了第二名。观众们对波波夫这种品质和技巧报以热烈掌声。
    在一个马蹄形的铁丝网内，举行着链球比赛，这是北京一般观众还没有见过的苏联的田赛项目，苏联链球冠军德宾科首先掷球，观众以好奇的心情注视着他，他拿起系球的钢丝的一端，把球在头顶旋了几下，又握着钢丝把身体旋了五、六转，然后向着掷球方向一松手，七公斤多重的用钢丝连着的链球就借着离心力沿切线飞出，在低空中划出一条长长的抛物线，在五十五公尺以外落地。我国运动员王宏、屈瑞林跟着掷球，他们是不久前在旅大时才向德宾科学来的。这次比赛中他们第一次掷球不但距离很近，而且方向很不准，德宾科当场细心地教导他们，立刻使他们有了显著进步。结果王宏获得了二十六点七八公尺，比他在沈阳的友谊比赛中所获得的成绩前进了三点一五五公尺。（新华社）
