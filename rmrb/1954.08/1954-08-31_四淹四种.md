Xinhua News Agency report by Yin Chongjing and Chen Jinduo:

It is already early autumn, but on the south bank of the Hui River, a tributary of the Huai River – in the Tuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative of Yaowei Village, Su County, Anhui Province – a portion of the land is still a vibrant green, with the replanted late autumn crops growing as vigorously as summer crops. The cooperative members are weeding the millet and buckwheat and turning the vines of the sweet potatoes.

Speaking of these lush crops, cooperative chairman Yao Yongbao and every member will tell you that this is the fourth time they have been replanted.

On July 4th, the first heavy rain flooded 110 mu of autumn crop seedlings within the cooperative. The rain came fiercely and heavily. In the Huaibei area, before the Huai River harnessing and drainage projects were built, the accumulated water would have stayed here for a month or two without receding. But this year, the water drained away in just two to five days through the newly dug and dredged ditches. The land quickly reappeared. Seeing the benefits of the Huai River project, the cooperative members were truly elated and enthusiastically completed replanting in three days. However, just a week after replanting, a second heavy rain came, even more severe than the first. Instantly, the water was knee-deep on the ground, not only submerging all the replanted land again but also flooding twice as much land. None of the men, women, and children in the cooperative had ever seen such heavy rain. The cooperative members began to worry, thinking that such a large amount of water would probably never recede. But completely unexpectedly, the rain stopped, and the water receded completely in a few days. Cooperative chairman Yao Yongbao immediately convened an emergency meeting of all members, organizing everyone to rush to replant. All the cooperative's male and female labor force were divided into two groups to carry out a replanting competition. On one side, the male members planted mung beans, guarding the water's edge day and night, replanting each patch as the water receded. On the other side, the female members were replanting sweet potatoes, ensuring that every seedling would survive. The elderly and children of the cooperative also participated in the replanting. The elderly cut sweet potato seedlings at home, and the children helped transport and distribute them. During breaks, the cooperative chairman and production team leaders climbed up trees to publicize and encourage the competing members. Thanks to the mobilization of the entire cooperative, the flooded land was quickly replanted.

After the Tuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative replanted twice, there were two more consecutive heavy rains, and the replanted crops were flooded twice more. Although these two rains were also heavy, the cooperative members believed that the accumulated water would quickly drain away, and their confidence in overcoming the flood disaster became even stronger. But two new problems arose: first, the season was getting later and later, would replanting still be useful? Second, there were no more seeds. To solve the first problem, the cooperative chairman visited Yao Guoxi, a 78-year-old man in the village. This elderly man had rich experience in planting crops. He said, "The season is not too late; planting will definitely yield a harvest." Regarding the second problem, the district people's government brought good news, saying that a large batch of late rice seeds from the people of Northeast China had arrived in the flood-stricken area. This news encouraged all the cooperative members, and they said excitedly and gratefully: If we don't replant well, we will let down the people of Northeast China. The accumulated water drained away quickly, just like the previous two times. In a fighting spirit, the entire cooperative successfully completed the replanting tasks twice in a row.

Four submergences, four plantings – this was not only the case for the Tuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative, but also in many places along the banks of the Hui River, a tributary of the Huai River. In the past, many places called "water prisons" had their riverbeds cleared and drainage capacity strengthened during the Huai River project. This year, although there was an exceptionally large flood, the large amount of accumulated water could be quickly drained away, greatly reducing the damage from waterlogging. Yao Guoxi, the 78-year-old man, said, "If it weren't for the Huai River project, with such a big flood this year, not only would we not be able to replant four times, but even the village would still be submerged!"

    四淹四种
    新华社记者　尹崇敬　陈金铎
    已是初秋的时候了，淮河支流浍河南岸——安徽省宿县姚圩村团结农业生产合作社，一部分土地上却正是一片新绿，补种的晚秋庄稼很像初夏时的农作物生长的那样茂盛。社员们正在给谷子、荞麦锄草，给山芋翻藤。
    一提起这片茂盛的庄稼，社长姚永保和每个社员都会告诉你这是第四次补种的了。
    七月四日下第一场大雨，淹没了社内一百一十亩秋庄稼的幼苗。雨来得又猛又大。在淮北地区，要是在治淮除涝工程兴修之前，积水停留在这里，个把月也不会退掉。可是今年只两三天到四五天的时间，积水就从许多新开挖的和疏浚了的沟渠内排出去了。土地迅速现了出来。社员们眼看到治淮的好处，真是兴高采烈，一股劲三天内就全补种上了。可是补种好才过一星期，又下第二场大雨，比前次更凶。顿时平地水深过膝，不仅把补种的地全重淹了，又多淹了一倍土地。全社男女老少，没有一个人曾看到过这样大的雨。社员们有些忧虑起来，认为这么大的水，恐怕再也退不出去了。可是完全出乎意料之外，雨停没有几天，水又全部下退了。社长姚永保立即召集全体社员开紧急会议，组织全体社员突击补种。全社男女劳动力分成两组，开展补种竞赛。这边男社员种绿豆，不分日夜守候在水边，水退一块补种一块。那边女社员们在补栽山芋，保证棵棵成活。全社的老年人和孩子们也参加了补种。老年人在家里剪山芋秧，孩子们帮助运送和散发。在休息的时候，社长和生产组组长们爬到大树上去，向竞赛中的社员们作宣传鼓动。由于全社总动员，被淹的土地很快又补种上了。
    团结农业生产合作社补种两次之后，接连又下了两次大雨，补种的庄稼又被淹了两次。这两次雨虽然都下得大，但是社员们相信积水会很快排出，战胜水灾的信心都愈加坚决。但是发生两个新问题：第一，季节越过越迟了，再补种还有没有用？第二，种籽没有了。为了解决第一个问题，社长去访问本村七十八岁的老人姚国喜。这个老年人有丰富的种庄稼的经验。他说：“季节还不算太迟，种下去完全能收。”第二个问题，区人民政府传来了喜讯，说是东北人民支援涝区的大批晚谷种已经运到了。这个消息鼓舞了全体社员，他们兴奋而感激地说：不好好补种，对不起东北人民。积水和以前两次一样，很快排出去了。全社社员以突击的战斗姿态，又连续两次胜利完成了补种的任务。
    四淹四种，不仅团结农业生产合作社，在淮河的支流浍河两岸很多地方都是如此。过去很多被称为“水牢”的地方，因为治淮中整理了河道，加强了排水能力，今年虽然发生特大洪水，也能将大量积水很快排出，大大减轻了内涝的灾害。七十八岁的老年人姚国喜说：“如果不是进行了治淮工程，今年这样大的洪水，不仅不能四次补种，现在连庄子还淹在水里呢！”
