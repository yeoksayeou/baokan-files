Several Pressing Issues in the Laiyang Prefecture Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations during Summer Production
    Yao Guang

From the materials of some districts and townships in Laiyang, Laixi, Penglai, and Qixia counties of Shandong Province, it can be seen that due to the education of the General Line and the active and effective measures taken by Party committees at all levels for summer harvesting, summer planting, and the operation and management of cooperatives and teams, the mutual aid and cooperation organizations have improved this year's summer harvesting and summer planting. The production management of the cooperatives is generally better than before the summer harvest, and the production management of the teams is also better than in the same period last year. Therefore, the summer harvesting and summer planting work of the general cooperatives and teams is better than in previous years. However, extremely serious problems have also been exposed in the summer harvest and summer planting:

    I. The operation and management of some cooperatives cannot keep up with the needs of production.

    Some cooperatives failed to produce according to plan, and autumn corn and sweet potatoes were planted more than ten days late. The main reasons are: (1) The contradiction between the private plots operated by the members themselves and the collective production of the cooperative has not been resolved. Many members only take care of their own affairs, and no one does the work of the cooperative. According to statistics from several districts, such cooperatives account for about 10 to 15 percent. (2) Enthusiastic engagement in sideline occupations delayed the sowing of corn and sweet potatoes. (3) The leadership of individual teams in some cooperatives is too weak, while other teams have serious departmentalism and do not help. This phenomenon is relatively common. (4) There is a failure to comprehensively utilize various labor forces, and there is no careful planning and rational allocation of labor, resulting in considerable waste of labor.

    In terms of work evaluation and work point calculation, although there has been great improvement with the implementation of the contract system, some new problems have also arisen, causing dissatisfaction and disorder. Some members failed to guarantee the quality of their work. The contracted work points are too low. After contracting, most members work actively, but the work points earned are still 10 to 30 percent less than the basic points. Some cooperatives did not evaluate and calculate work points for each group in time, resulting in a backlog that could not be cleared.

    Some cooperatives did not handle the wheat pre-distribution problem reasonably enough, resulting in a decrease in income for some members and ideological instability.

    If these problems cannot be resolved quickly, they will inevitably cause serious losses in production and affect the consolidation of the cooperatives.

    How to solve these problems?

    (1) Through summarizing the summer harvesting and summer planting work, affirm achievements, commend good people and good deeds in the summer harvesting and summer planting, and use examples to educate and improve the awareness of members; and then analyze and solve the current urgent problems. In the summary, it is necessary to educate members' thinking, improve collectivist thinking, overcome individualism, departmentalism, and the idea of emphasizing sideline occupations and neglecting agriculture, compare advantages and disadvantages, improve awareness, and study solutions; and take care of the personal interests of members on the basis of safeguarding the collective interests. In the summary, it is also necessary to adjust the labor organization, adjust the backbone, crops, farm implements, and livestock according to the needs of the next stage of production and the experience and lessons of the previous stage, strengthen the weak teams; summarize the experience and lessons of the previous stage of contracting and work point calculation, solve the problems that occurred in the previous stage, clear the accounts, and study improvement methods. In addition, it is also necessary to check the masonry problems that occurred in the pre-distribution of wheat and solve them reasonably.

    (2) Grasp the key to increasing production in the next stage by making a good small-scale plan for the next stage and conduct specific research. According to the favorable conditions in summer, raise more pigs and accumulate more green manure. The leadership should regard fertilizer accumulation as an important production key to lead, cultivate typical examples, and exchange experiences; each cooperative should make a plan, assign special personnel to be responsible for organizing inspections, and reasonably adjust fertilizer prices to stimulate members' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer. This year, most cooperatives have more autumn corn and more densely planted millet and sorghum, so it is necessary to carry out summer topdressing well to ensure a good harvest this year.

    II. Some perennial mutual aid teams have disintegrated because they cannot adapt to the characteristics of tight summer farm work and strong timeliness.

    In Shanqiandian Township, Laiyang Third District, among the 82 teams, 27 teams persisted in their original form during the summer harvest, 17 teams changed from large teams to small teams (either calculating work points or not), 16 teams were partly members working individually and partly members working collectively or in small groups (not calculating work points or calculating work points), and 22 teams were scattered and working individually. Secondly, some teams mechanically implemented the method of "exchanging labor for labor." During the summer harvest, they failed to solve the contradiction between the shortage of labor for members during busy times and the repayment of labor during slack times by increasing points or raising wages during busy times. Therefore, members with more labor were unwilling to work for others during the summer harvest, and the mutual aid team disintegrated; there were also cases where members with less labor were afraid of immediately having to find wages (not allowing repayment later) and disintegrated.

    Therefore, it is necessary to tighten up the rectification of mutual aid teams. Village branch committee members should be assigned to be responsible for strengthening the leadership of mutual aid teams. The main thing is to grasp three points: (1) First, check and solve the problems that occurred in the summer harvest and summer planting, improve those that have persisted, and rectify and restore those that have disintegrated; (2) Grasp the four links of making a good small-scale plan, giving full play to labor potential, doing a good job in work evaluation and work point calculation, and democratic consultation in sequence to solve the problem of the priority of farm work; (3) According to the characteristics of summer production, negotiate to resolve the contradiction between the shortage of labor during busy farming seasons and the repayment of labor during slack farming seasons.

    莱阳专区互助合作组织在夏季生产中的几个迫切问题
    姚光
    从山东省莱阳、莱西、蓬莱、栖霞等县部分区乡的材料看，由于进行了总路线的教育和各级党委对夏收夏种和社、组的经营管理主动地采取了有效措施，今年夏收夏种中互助合作组织有所提高，社的生产管理一般比夏收前好，组的生产管理也比去年同期为好，因而一般社组夏收夏种工作比往年做得好。但是，在夏收夏种中也暴露出了极为严重的问题：
    一、一部分社的经营管理工作还跟不上生产的需要。
    部分社未能按照计划进行生产，秋苞米和红薯晚种了十余天。主要原因是：（1）社员自己经营的自留地与社的集体生产之间的矛盾没有解决，许多社员光顾忙自己的，社里的活没人干。据几个区的统计，这样的社约占百分之十到十五。（2）热心搞副业，耽误了苞米、红薯的播种。（3）有些社的个别队领导太弱，而其他队又有严重的本位主义思想，不去帮助。这种现象是比较多的。（4）没有全面地运用各种劳动力，也没有周密打算合理支配劳动力，误工窝工不少。
    在评工计工方面，虽有很大改进，实行了包工制，但也发生了一些新问题，引起不满和紊乱。有些社员未能保证做活的质量。包的工分太低，大部分社包工后社员虽积极地干，但所得工分仍少于基本分一至三成。有些社各小组未及时评工计工，积压在一起，清不出来。
    有些社小麦预分问题处理得不够合理，有的社员收入减少，思想发生动摇。
  这些问题如不能迅速解决，就必然会造成生产上的严重损失，影响社的巩固。
    怎样解决这些问题呢？
    （一）通过总结夏收夏种工作，肯定成绩，表扬在夏收夏种中的好人好事，以实例进行教育，提高社员的觉悟；进而分析和解决当前急待解决的问题。在总结中，要针对社员思想进行教育，提高集体主义的思想，克服个人主义、本位主义和重副业轻农业的思想，对比利害，提高觉悟，研究解决办法；并在维护集体利益的基础上，照顾社员个人的利益。在总结中，还要根据下段生产需要和前段经验教训，调整劳动组织，调整骨干、作物、农具、牲口，加强薄弱的队；总结前段包工和计工评工的经验教训，解决前段发生的问题，清工结账，研究改善办法。此外，还要检查小麦预分中发生的砌题，加以合理的解决。
      （二）抓住做好下段的小段计划，具体研究，抓住下段增产关键。可根据夏季的有利条件，多养猪，多积绿肥，领导方面要把积肥当做一个重要的生产关键来领导，培养典型，交流经验；各社要做出计划，分工专人负责组织检查，并应合理调整肥料价格，刺激社员积肥积极性。今年各社一般秋苞米多，谷子高粱密植的多，因而需要很好进行夏季追肥，来保证今年丰收。
      二、部分常年互助组因为不能适应夏季农活紧张、时间性强烈的特点而涣散解体。
    莱阳三区山前店乡八十二个组，在夏收中原组原样坚持下来的二十七组，化大组为小组的十七个组（或计工或不计工），部分组员单干、部分组员集体干或小组干（不计工或计工）的十六组，分散单干的二十二个组。其次，有些组机械实行“以工换工”为主的办法，在夏收中未能用忙时加分或提高工资的办法来解决社员闲忙时欠工和闲时还工的矛盾，因而劳力多的社员夏收中不愿给别人干活，互助组就解体了；也有因劳力较少的组员怕立即就要找工资（不让以后还工）而解体的。
    因此，对互助组要特别抓紧整顿。村支部委员要分工负责，加强对互助组的领导。主要抓住三点：（1）首先检查和解决夏收夏种中发生的问题，把坚持下来的提高一步，把涣散解体的整顿恢复起来；（2）抓住做好小段计划、发挥劳动潜力、搞好评工计工、民主协商先后等四个环节，解决农活先后的问题；（3）根据夏季生产特点，协商解决农忙欠工和农闲还工间的矛盾。
