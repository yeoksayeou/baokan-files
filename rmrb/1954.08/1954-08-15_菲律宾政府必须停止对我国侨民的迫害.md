    The Philippine Government Must Stop Persecuting Our Overseas Chinese

    On June 19th, the Philippine government promulgated the so-called "Retail Trade Nationalization Act." This act stipulates that, in the future, foreigners (actually aiming at Chinese) are prohibited from opening new retail businesses; if foreigners currently engaged in retail trade retire or die, their descendants have no right of inheritance; at the same time, the Philippine government can confiscate the business licenses of foreigners at any time based on the pretext of "violating various laws," and sentence them to imprisonment, fines, and deportation. Obviously, this act is a serious act by the Philippine reactionary ruling clique to intensify the persecution of our overseas Chinese compatriots.

    Among the overseas Chinese residing in the Philippines, more than half are engaged in retail trade for generations; many overseas Chinese engaged in import and export trade and other businesses are also closely related to them. Therefore, the implementation of the "Retail Trade Nationalization Act" will inevitably grossly infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of our vast number of overseas Chinese, deprive them of their social occupations, cause them to lose their jobs in large numbers, and plunge them into a situation of destitution. This cannot but arouse great anger and opposition from our overseas Chinese compatriots and our people.

    As everyone knows, retail trade belongs entirely to general business. Now, the reason why the Philippine reactionary ruling clique wants to "nationalize" it is obviously not due to the needs of the Philippine economy. It is enough to point out that while the Magsaysay government desperately restricts and prohibits overseas Chinese from engaging in general businesses, and stubbornly "nationalizes" some retail businesses on which overseas Chinese rely for their livelihoods, American monopoly capital controls the economic lifeline of the Philippines, seriously damaging the Philippines' economic sovereignty and interests. The Magsaysay government not only does not "nationalize" it, but openly stipulates that no provision of this act shall in any way affect or prejudice any rights and interests of American citizens and legal entities. This clearly shows that the Philippine government is using the signboard of "nationalization" to implement a vicious persecution of our overseas Chinese compatriots in a planned manner.

    As in the past, the Magsaysay government's adoption of this measure to persecute overseas Chinese was instructed by the United States. Philippine Congressman Miraglia openly advocated completely depriving overseas Chinese in the Philippines of their right to survival, saying, "The United States agrees that the Philippines should take the opportunity to 'nationalize' everything without delay."

    The Philippine government's persecution of overseas Chinese in this way also suits the more shameful purposes of the United States. As everyone sees, the United States is stepping up various aggressive activities in Asia that are hostile to the People's Republic of China, and the Magsaysay government is actively acting as a tiger's pawn for the United States. Its intensified persecution of our overseas Chinese compatriots is obviously to please the US ruling clique, which is hostile to the People's Republic of China, with this action.

    However, what good results will the Magsaysay government's approach bring? The Chinese people must warn the Philippine government that our overseas Chinese compatriots have a strong motherland, and they will not allow anyone to persecute them wantonly. The Philippine government must immediately stop any acts of persecution against overseas Chinese, and provide effective protection for their legitimate rights such as residence, business, education, and speech.

### 菲律宾政府必须停止对我国侨民的迫害

    菲律宾政府必须停止对我国侨民的迫害
    六月十九日，菲律宾政府颁布了所谓“零售商菲化法案”。这个法案规定，今后禁止外侨（其实目的是禁止华侨）开办新的零售商业；目前经营零售商的外侨退休或死亡后，他的后裔没有继承权；同时菲律宾政府随时都可以根据“违反各项法律”的借口没收外侨的营业执照，并对他们判处监禁、罚款和驱逐出境。非常明显，这个法案是菲律宾反动统治集团变本加厉地迫害我国侨胞的严重行为。
    我国旅居菲律宾的侨胞中，有多半数是世世代代经营零售商的；还有许多经营进出口贸易及其他营业的侨胞，也和他们有着密切关连。因此“零售商菲化法案”的实施，必将粗暴地侵犯我国广大侨胞的正当权益，剥夺他们的社会职业，使他们大批失业，而陷于生活无着的境地。这不能不引起我国侨胞和我国人民的重大愤怒和反对。
    大家知道，零售商完全属于一般的营业。现在，菲律宾反动统治集团所以要把它“菲律宾化”，显然并不是由于菲律宾经济的必需。只要指出一点就够了，麦格赛赛政府拚命限制和禁止华侨经营一般营业，硬要把一些华侨赖以为生的零售商“菲律宾化”，但是美国垄断资本控制了菲律宾的经济命脉，严重地损害了菲律宾的经济主权和利益，麦格赛赛政府却不仅不把它“菲律宾化”，反而公然规定这个法案的任何条文不得在任何方面影响或损及美国的公民和法人的任何权益。这就清楚地说明菲律宾政府是在利用“菲律宾化”这个招牌，有计划地对我国侨胞实行凶恶的迫害。
    和过去一样，麦格赛赛政府采取这种迫害华侨的措施，是美国授意的。菲律宾众议员迷拉利亚公然主张完全剥夺菲律宾华侨的生存权利，他说，“美国赞同菲律宾应乘机把一切都‘菲律宾化’，勿予拖延。”
    菲律宾政府如此迫害华侨，还适合于美国的更可耻的目的。大家看到，美国正在亚洲加紧进行敌视中华人民共和国的种种侵略活动，麦格赛赛政府则积极为美国作虎伥。它加紧迫害我国侨胞，显然也就是要用这种行动来向敌视中华人民共和国的美国统治集团讨好。
    但是，麦格赛赛政府的这种做法，会有什么好结果呢？中国人民必须警告菲律宾政府，我国侨胞有着一个强大的祖国，他们是不容任何人肆意加以迫害的。菲律宾政府必须立即停止迫害华侨的任何行为，并对他们的居住、营业、教育、言论等正当权利加以切实的保障。
