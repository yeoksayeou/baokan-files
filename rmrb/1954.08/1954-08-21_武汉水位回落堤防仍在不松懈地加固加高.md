    武汉水位回落堤防仍在不松懈地加固加高
    据新华社讯：武汉关长江水位回落。十八日下午四时，武汉关长江水位曾涨到二九点七三公尺，这样持续了十小时没有上涨，在十九日晨三时开始回落，到十九日下午五时，水位为二九点六八公尺，比原来回落了五公分；到二十日下午五时，水位落到二九点六六公尺，比十九日同一时间降低二公分，但仍超过历年最高水位一点三八公尺。二十日，长江上游和中游除四川清溪场到云阳以及黄石市到九江部分地区水位微涨外，各地水位普遍下落。二十日长江上游天气放晴，中下游虽继续下雨，但雨量不大。
    目前，武汉市仍在异常高的水位严重威胁下，为了最后战胜洪水，全市堤防正在不松懈地加固加高，及时妥善地处理堤防上的险工。
