Xinhua News Agency: French General Confederation of Labor, French Veterans and War Victims Association Issue Communiqués Opposing "European Army" and Demanding Peaceful Resolution of the German Question
West European Six Foreign Ministers Meet to Discuss French "Revisions" to the "European Army" Treaty

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The French General Confederation of Labor issued a letter to the French working people regarding the "European Defense Community" six-nation foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels, exposing the fatal consequences that the establishment of a "European Army" would bring to France.

The French General Confederation of Labor debunked the deceptive claim that arming West Germany is "inevitable" and that the only choice is how to arm it. The communiqué stated: In reality, what France should be choosing between is: arming Germany or peacefully resolving the issue of restoring German unity, establishing a "European Defense Community" or organizing a European collective security system, an arms race or universal, supervised disarmament, war or peace.

The French General Confederation of Labor calls on all trade union organizations and all working people to unite, launch a massive movement to protest the parliament's ratification of the Paris Treaty, and resolutely demand that the Mendès-France government negotiate with the Soviet Union to peacefully resolve the German question and organize a European collective security system.

"L'Humanité" also published a statement from the French Veterans and War Victims Association. This organization, representing three million members, said: "The fundamental condition for maintaining peace in Europe lies in the peaceful resolution of the German question. If the German question can be peacefully resolved within the scope of a treaty, any possibility of the revival of German militarism can be completely eliminated, and the security of Germany's neighbors can be fully guaranteed."

The French Veterans and War Victims Association opposes the establishment of a "European Army" and demands a four-power conference to promote further easing of international tensions and to "lay the foundation for holding a broader conference to establish a just and lasting peace."

[Xinhua News Agency, August 20th dispatch] TASS Brussels, August 19th dispatch: The meeting of foreign ministers of the six Western European countries that signed the "European Defense Community" treaty opened on August 19th at the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Brussels. Participating in the meeting were Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mendès-France, West German Chancellor Adenauer, Italian Foreign Minister Piziarni, Dutch Foreign Minister Beyen, and Luxembourg Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Buck.

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the French proposals: to propose certain "revisions" to the "European Defense Community" treaty to facilitate its passage through the French Parliament. According to the Paris "Liberation," the French delegation is basically composed of people who support the "European Defense Community" treaty.

The first meeting on August 19th was a closed meeting.

Brussels sources point out that the representatives of Great Britain and the United States are particularly concerned about this meeting, although neither the United States nor Great Britain signed the "European Defense Community" treaty or participated in the meeting. It is pointed out that U.S. Senator Wiley's visit to Paris and British Ambassador to France Jebb's meeting with Mendès-France at the station on the 18th before his departure for Brussels to attend the meeting illustrate this concern. According to newspaper reports, the British government has notified the participants of the Brussels meeting of its views on the issues to be discussed. David Bruce, the U.S. representative to "European" organizations such as the "European Coal and Steel Community," has held talks with Adenauer and Spaak successively. Bruce attended the opening meeting as an "observer."

    法国总工会、法国退伍军人和战争受难者协会分别发表文告
    反对“欧洲军”，要求和平解决德国问题
    西欧六国外长开会讨论法国对“欧洲军”条约的“修正”
    据新华社讯：法国总工会就“欧洲防务集团”六国外长布鲁塞尔会议发表告法国劳动人民书，揭露建立“欧洲军”将给法国带来的致命后果。
    法国总工会揭穿了所谓武装西德“必不可免”而只有在如何武装的方式上进行选择的这种骗人的话。文告说：实际上，法国应当进行选择的是：武装德国还是和平解决恢复德国统一的问题，建立“欧洲防务集团”还是组织欧洲集体安全体系，军备竞赛还是普遍地、有监督地裁军，战争还是和平。
    法国总工会号召一切工会组织及全体劳动人民团结起来，展开抗议议会批准巴黎条约的声势浩大的运动，并且坚决要求孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府和苏联谈判，以便和平解决德国问题并且组织欧洲集体安全体系。
    “人道报”还刊载了法国退伍军人和战争受难者协会的声明。这个组织代表三百万会员说：“保持欧洲和平的基本条件在于和平解决德国问题。如果能在和约范围内和平解决德国问题，就可以彻底消除德国军国主义复活的任何可能性，并且可以完全保障德国各邻国的安全。”
    法国退伍军人和战争受难者协会反对建立“欧洲军”，并且要求举行四大国会议，以促成国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，而为“举行更加广泛的会议以建立正义的、巩固的和平打下基础”。
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社布鲁塞尔十九日讯：签订“欧洲防务集团”条约的西欧六国的外长会议八月十九日在布鲁塞尔比利时外交部开幕。参加这次会议的有比利时外交大臣斯巴克、法国总理兼外交部长孟戴斯—弗朗斯、西德总理阿登纳、意大利外交部长皮齐阿尼、荷兰外交大臣贝恩、卢森堡首相兼外交大臣伯克。
    会议的目的是讨论法国提出的建议：对“欧洲防务集团”条约提出某些“修正”，以便于法国议会通过这个条约。据巴黎“解放报”指出：法国代表团基本上是由拥护“欧洲防务集团”条约的人组成的。
    八月十九日的第一次会议是秘密会议。
    布鲁塞尔人士指出，英国和美国的代表对这次会议特别关心，虽然美国和英国都没有在“欧洲防务集团”条约上签字，也没有参加这次会议。大家指出，美国参议员维利到巴黎以及英国驻法国大使杰伯在十八日孟戴斯—弗朗斯启程赴布鲁塞尔出席会议以前在车站和他的会谈，都说明了这种关心。据报纸消息，英国政府已经把自己对所要讨论的问题的观点通知布鲁塞尔会议的参加者。美国在“欧洲煤钢联营”之类的“欧洲”组织中的代表戴维·布鲁斯已先后和阿登纳以及斯巴克举行了会谈。布鲁斯以“观察员”身份出席开幕会议。
