    A Seriously Wasteful Construction Site
    Ji Ran
    The New 360 Project is one of China's important industrial construction projects this year. It is a highly automated factory built with the latest Soviet technology and equipment. Since construction began last October, it has made great progress. Many employees have worked diligently and overcome many difficulties in the construction process. Now, a main factory building of more than nine stories and many auxiliary buildings have been erected, and the complex machine installation work has also begun. Ten months ago, this was still a barren wilderness, but now it has become a tense and heated construction site.
    However, this important project has serious shortcomings in its construction: quality accidents occur repeatedly, the site order and safety situation is very poor, and especially, the phenomenon of waste is extremely alarming. In order to correct the waste and chaos, in February and March of this year, under the leadership of the local Party committee, the construction site launched a "anti-waste, anti-irresponsibility" campaign, exposing many serious problems. The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry and the local Party committee also sent people to conduct in-depth inspections of the construction site. The following are some of the main facts that were revealed.
  Lack of Planning Leads to Large Accumulation and Waste of Building Materials
    Material waste is a major aspect of the waste in the 360 Project. The first is the large accumulation of materials. Due to the hasty start of construction and the failure to develop a construction organization measures plan, materials were blindly purchased. As a result, the specifications of purchased materials did not match the specifications required for the project. A large amount of steel, wood, etc. were transported from various places, and those that were not suitable were piled up without being disposed of in time. According to preliminary estimates, the accumulated funds amounted to more than 14.4 billion yuan.
    Secondly, for some materials that could be applied for allocation from the state, the application and balancing work was not done in time, and they were purchased from the market for immediate use. The market price was of course much more expensive than the state allocation price, resulting in a loss of more than 2.57 billion yuan in price difference. Some materials were also defrauded by unscrupulous merchants, such as the straw curtains used for winter construction, resulting in a loss of 60 to 70 million yuan.
    In terms of material use, due to the lack of correct budget and quota restrictions, and the lack of a sound material requisition and return system, materials were given as much as they were requested. According to preliminary statistics, more than 1.8 billion yuan was wasted (in reality, it will exceed this amount). For example, there are already 143 tons of steel bar ends that have been randomly cut off. The loss of wood is also equally serious. Good pine wood is used on the construction site to make toolboxes and work sheds. Family members of workers and the cooking room even take wood of more than one meter in length to burn for fire and make furniture. In terms of cement use, due to the lack of serious technical management and the failure to master the mix proportion, it was calculated that 481 tons of cement were wasted from April 10 to the end of May alone.
  Imperfect Management System, Chaotic Construction Site
    To carry out the construction of a complex modern industry, it is necessary to first do a good job in construction organization design and overall layout of the construction site, so that the huge construction site works in an orderly manner. This has been repeatedly proven in past basic construction. However, the 360 Project had neither a thorough overall layout of the site before construction, nor did it pay attention to overall consideration after the start of construction, resulting in various chaotic phenomena on the construction site.
    During the inspection of the 360 Project, people found more than 40 unfounded wooden sheds on the construction site. When were these wooden sheds built? Who approved their construction? Where did the materials come from? What were they built for? Even the person in charge of the construction site could not answer. Later, it was found that most of them were built by workers who "automatically" took materials because there was no strict material management system.
    Because there was no clear responsibility system and good working order on the construction site, waste and chaos spread everywhere on the construction site like weeds. The damage of tools, the loss of public property and other phenomena were very common on the construction site. For example, since the construction site started, tens of thousands of rice bowls have been bought, averaging eight or nine bowls per person, but now the workers often suffer from bowl shortage when eating and drinking. Where have the tens of thousands of bowls gone? No one knows. According to the construction site statistics, 728 pickaxes have been lost, and only more than 70 of the 350 thermometers in the laboratory are left.
    The seriousness of the lack of responsibility system and work discipline can also be illustrated by the following example: the construction site bought more than 140 million yuan worth of electrical materials from the state-owned China Traffic Electrical Equipment Company, paid the money but did not transport the goods back. After a few months, the seller found this large pile of electrical materials during inventory and urged the engineering company to transport them back.
    The 360 construction site is covered with yellow sand, and templates with nails are littered everywhere, even blocking the roads. No one has cleaned them up for a long time. Slogans such as "Beware of upturned nails" are hung everywhere on the construction site, but accidents in which workers are stabbed in the feet by nails still occur constantly. Once, the construction site ran out of nails and had no money to buy them, and the director of the construction site was so anxious that he was at a loss. Later, someone went to the construction site and warehouse to check, and quickly collected 13 buckets of nails. A worker picked up a little next to him and weighed more than two kilograms. Therefore, the workers said: "The 360 construction site is paved with gold." Someone estimated that at least tons of usable No. 8 lead wire could be picked up on the construction site. Once, a group of workers picked up 150 welding rods on the ground and gave them to the director of the construction site.
  Labor Productivity is Surprisingly Low
    The labor productivity of the 360 construction site is surprisingly low, greatly increasing the project cost and creating huge waste. For example, in terms of civil engineering construction, the quota for North China this year is 975 to 1,200 bricks per person per working day, while here it averaged only about 250 bricks in February and March. When the labor efficiency of the construction site was at its lowest this year, the efficiency of steelworkers and formworkers only reached 15% of the quota, the work efficiency of concrete workers only reached two-fifths of the quota, and the efficiency of bricklayers even only reached one-twentieth of the quota. Low labor efficiency means a large increase in workers. According to Soviet experts, if efficiency is improved, the number of workers can be reduced by about one-third.
    The main reasons for the low labor efficiency are serious idling, shutdowns, and rework. For example, the machine repair site was transferred 120 riveters due to poor planning, idling for a month and a half. Another example is that more than 200 carpenters were transferred to the 7-meter platform of the main factory building in order to speed up the progress, but more than 600 workdays were lost due to other accidents. According to statistics, the loss caused by low labor efficiency by the end of June reached 2.3 billion yuan. The lax labor discipline of employees is also an important reason for low labor efficiency. The construction site lacks strong political work and strict labor discipline, and various phenomena of lax labor discipline have not been corrected in time. According to the worker allocation department, the lost working hours due to this amounted to 37,500 workdays.
    We know that an important method to improve labor productivity is to adopt new machinery and technology and implement the mechanization of the labor process. The 360 construction site has the necessary material basis for improving labor productivity - a large number of mechanical tools, dump trucks, transport trucks, various cranes, excavators, bulldozers, belt conveyors, etc., all of which are readily available. However, these modern construction machines have encountered a lazy owner, and many machines have suffered misfortune: excavators are left unused, dump trucks are also left unused, but a large amount of manual labor is used to carry soil; 17-meter tower cranes, electric plate bending machines, etc. have been left idle for more than a month.
  Waste of Indirect Expenses
    The 360 construction site also showed various wastes and extravagance in other indirect expense expenditures. The temporary construction area and unit cost of the construction site both exceeded the regulations of the higher authorities. The unit cost per square meter was one-third higher than the regulations. According to statistics, if it is built according to the prescribed standards, it can save a huge amount of 2.3 billion yuan.
    The preparatory office for the new factory was even more extravagant in the purchase of household goods. Twenty-eight sets of sofas were purchased, and thirty-three carpets were purchased, including a top-grade carpet worth 14.36 million yuan and a set of velvet sofas worth 5.9 million yuan. The rest, such as cars, radios, etc., were bought too much, and the general furniture was of high quality. This cost more than 4 billion yuan just to buy furniture. Now the two parties, A and B, have more than 100 desks left over. The annual plan for labor protection supplies of the construction unit is 1 billion yuan, and 1.4 billion yuan has been spent so far. This year, on May Day, the manager approved 26 million yuan at one time as holiday expenses.
    The above are the main aspects of the serious waste on the 360 construction site. Now, under the direct guidance of the higher-level leading organs, they are actively rectifying the working order, strengthening political and ideological work, strengthening planning work and establishing a responsibility system, and the situation of waste and chaos has been initially improved. Of course, there is a lot of waste that cannot be recovered.

    一个严重浪费的工地季然
    新建三六○工程是我国今年工业建设的重要工程之一，它是以苏联最新的技术装备建设的一座高度自动化的工厂。这个工程从去年十月动工以来，已有了很大进展。许多职工在建设工作中辛勤劳动，克服了许多困难。现在一座九层多高的主厂房和许多附属建筑物都已矗立起来，复杂的机器安装工作也已开始。十个月前这里还是一片荒芜的旷野，现在已成了一个紧张热烈的建设工地。
    但是，这个重要的工程在施工中存在着严重的缺点：质量事故一再发生，工地秩序和安全情况很不好，而尤其是浪费现象极为惊人。为了纠正浪费和混乱现象，今年二、三月中，工地在当地党委领导下，曾展开了一次“反浪费、反无人负责”的运动，揭发了许多严重问题。中央燃料工业部和当地党委也派人深入工地进行了检查。以下就是揭发出来的一些主要事实。
  缺乏计划造成建筑材料的大量
    积压和浪费
    材料的浪费是三六○工程浪费中的一个主要方面。首先是材料的大量积压。由于开工仓促，没有编制施工组织措施计划，盲目采购材料，因而采购材料的规格与工程需要的规格不符，大量钢材、木料等从各地运来后，不合用的就堆存起来，也没有及时处理，据初步估计共积压资金达一百四十四亿余元。
    其次是有些可以向国家申请调拨的材料，没有及时做好申请平衡工作，而向市场现抓现用，市场价格当然比国家调拨价贵得多，结果就损失差价二十五亿七千多万元。有些材料还为不法商人所骗，如冬季施工用的草帘，共损失了六、七千万元。
    在材料使用上由于没有正确的预算和定额限制，没有健全的领退料制度，要多少给多少，据初步统计浪费了十八亿余元（实际上要超过此数）。例如被随便截断的钢筋头已有一百四十三吨。木材的损失也同样严重。工地上用很好的松木来做工具箱、工棚。工人家属和炊事房甚至拿一公尺以上的木头去烧火，做家具。水泥使用上也由于缺乏认真的技术管理，没有掌握配合比，只四月十日到五月末的计算，即浪费水泥四百八十一吨。
  管理制度不健全、施工现场混乱
    进行复杂的现代化工业的建设，必须首先做好施工组织设计，作好施工现场的整体布置，使得庞大的工地上工作井然有序。这已是过去基本建设施工中一再证明了的。但三六○工程在施工前既无周密的场地整体布置，在开工后又忽视通盘考虑，工地上就产生了种种混乱现象。
    在检查三六○工程时，人们在工地上发现了四十多座没有来由的木棚子。这些木棚子是什么时候盖的？是谁批准盖的？材料是那里来的？盖了干什么用的？连工地负责人也答不上来。后来查明大部分是因为没有严格的材料管理制度，工人们“自动”拿了材料来盖的。
    由于工地上没有严明的责任制度和良好的工作秩序，浪费和混乱就像野草似的在施工现场上到处蔓延开来。工地上工具的损坏，公物的遗失等现象十分普遍。例如工地自开工以来饭碗买了数万只，每人平均可以摊到八、九只，但是现在工人们吃饭喝水还是常闹碗荒，数万只碗到那里去了呢？谁也不知道。据工地统计，仅镐头就丢失了七百二十八把，化验室三百五十多支温度计只剩下了七十多支。
    缺乏责任制度和工作纪律的严重程度，还可用这样一个例子来说明：工地在国营中国交通电工器材公司买了一亿四千多万元的电料，付了钱却没有把货运回来。过了几个月，卖主盘库时发现了这一大堆电料，才催工程公司运了回去。
    三六○工地上到处黄沙铺地，有钉子的模板随处乱扔，甚至堵塞道路，长期没人清理，工地各处都挂着“当心朝天钉子”的标语牌，但是工人们被钉子刺伤脚的事故仍不断发生。有一次，工地上钉子用完了，又没钱去买，工地主任急得团团转，后来有人到工地和仓库里去清查，很快就搜集了十三桶钉子。有个工人在身旁稍稍拾了一下，一称有二斤多。所以工人们说：“三六○工地是黄金铺地。”有人估计工地上能用的八号铅丝，拾起来至少上吨。有一次一个工人小组在地上拾了一百五十根电焊条，送给了工地主任。
  劳动生产率低得惊人
    三六○工地的劳动生产率惊人地低下，大大地增加了工程成本，形成巨大的浪费。例如土木建筑方面，今年华北区定额是每人每工作日砌砖九百七十五块到一千二百块，而这里二、三月份平均只达到二百五十块左右。今年工地劳动效率最低的时候，钢筋工和模板工的效率都只达到定额的百分之十五，混凝土工的工作效率只达到定额的五分之二，砌砖工的效率甚至只达定额的二十分之一。劳动效率低，就只好大量增加工人。据苏联专家估计，如果效率提高，工人大约可以减少三分之一。
    劳动效率低落的主要原因是窝工、停工、返工的情况严重。例如机修工地由于计划不周，调来了一百二十名铆工，窝工一个半月。又如主厂房七公尺平台为了争取进度，及早调去木工二百多人，但因其他事故又损失六百多工日。据统计，到六月底止，由于劳动效率低而造成的损失达二十三亿元。职工劳动纪律松弛也是劳动效率低下的重要原因。工地上缺乏坚强的政治工作和严明的劳动纪律，各种劳动纪律松懈的现象没有及时得到纠正。据工人调配科估计，因此而损失的工时达三万七千五百工日。
    我们知道，提高劳动生产率的重要方法是采用新机械新技术，实行劳动过程的机械化。三六○工地拥有提高劳动生产率的必要物质基础——为数很多的机械工具，自卸卡车、运输卡车、各式起重机、掘土机、推土机、皮带运输机等等，无不应有尽有。但是这些近代化施工机械却遇到了一个懒惰的主人，许多机器都遭了不幸：掘土机放着不用，自卸车也放着不用，却用大量人工来抬土；十七公尺塔式吊车、电动卷板机等都被搁了一个多月。
  间接费用的浪费
    三六○工地在其他间接费用开支上，也表现了种种的浪费和铺张。工地临时建筑在建筑面积上和单位造价上，都超过了上级的规定。每平方公尺的单位造价比规定高出三分之一。据统计，如果按照规定标准建筑，就可以节约二十三亿元的巨款。
    新厂筹建处在生活用具的购置上，更是铺张。沙发买了二十八套，地毯买了三十三条，其中包括一千四百三十六万元一条的上等地毯和五百九十余万元一套的丝绒沙发。其余如大小汽车，收音机等都买得过多，一般家具都是上等质量。这样仅仅买家具就花了四十余亿元。现在甲乙双方仅办公桌就剩余了一百张以上。施工单位的劳保用品全年计划是十亿元，目前已花去了十四亿元。今年“五一”节，经理一次就批了二千六百万元，作为过节费用。
    以上就是三六○工地严重浪费的几个主要方面。现在，他们在上级领导机关的直接指导下，正在积极整顿工作秩序，加强政治思想工作，加强计划工作和建立责任制度，浪费和混乱的情况已有初步好转。当然，有许多浪费已经是无法挽回了的。
