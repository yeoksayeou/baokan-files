    Huangshi City Convenes First People's Congress, Mobilizes City to Strengthen Flood Defense and Security
    Huangshi City, a rising industrial city in the Daye region on the south bank of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province, convened its first People's Congress on July 28th, and elected representatives from the city to attend the Hubei Provincial People's Congress.

    Acting Mayor of the Municipal People's Government, Song Zhongzhou, reported to the 156 representatives attending the meeting on the government's work, as well as the government's leadership of the city in fighting the Yangtze River floods since June, safeguarding national construction and the safety of the city's people. The report stated that the government's recent work is to continue to lead the city's people to fight the floods.

    Before liberation, the urban area of Huangshi City was just two unremarkable small towns, Huangshigang and Shihuiyao, located fifteen miles apart on the south bank of the Yangtze River in the Daye Iron Mine area. After liberation, the Daye Steel Plant, Huaxin Cement Plant, and coal, electricity, and other industrial production and municipal construction have developed year by year. The two small towns have gradually merged into one, becoming an industrial city with a population of 130,000. Since the beginning of summer this year, continuous heavy rainfall has caused the water level of the city's inland lakes to exceed historical records, with water accumulating in some low-lying areas and newly built workers' residential areas. At the end of June, the first flood peak of the Yangtze River caused the Yangtze River water level here to exceed the highest historical record. The Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Government led the people in a resolute struggle against the floods. Until now, the expansion project of the Daye Steel Plant and various factories and mines continue to persist in production, overcoming numerous difficulties.

    The representatives discussed Song Zhongzhou's report and unanimously passed a resolution expressing satisfaction with the government's work; and agreed to the specific measures proposed by the government to strengthen flood control. The representatives also unanimously supported the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which is currently being widely discussed among the people of the country.

    Workers make up the majority of Huangshi City's population. Among the 156 municipal people's representatives, 63 were industrial workers. Among the ten representatives from Hubei Province elected at the meeting were Qiu Fangren, a labor model from Daye Steel Plant, Hu Jihui, a labor model from the power plant, and Wang Tao, a cement expert from the joint state-private Huaxin Cement Plant.

    黄石市召开首届人民代表大会第一次会议
    动员全市人民加强防汛保卫建设和安全
    湖北省长江南岸大冶地区新兴的工业城市——黄石市，已在七月二十八日召开了第一届人民代表大会第一次会议，选举了这个城市出席湖北省人民代表大会会议的代表。
    市人民政府代理市长宋中洲向出席会议的一百五十六名代表报告了政府工作，以及六月份以来政府领导全市人民和长江洪水搏斗，保卫了国家建设和全市人民安全的情况。报告提出：政府最近的工作仍是领导全市人民再接再厉地和洪水搏斗。
    黄石市市区在解放以前，只是大冶铁矿区长江南岸的两个相距十五里的不著名的小集镇——黄石港和石灰窑。解放后这里的大冶钢厂、华新水泥厂以及煤、电等工业生产和市政建设逐年发展，两个小集镇已逐渐连成一片，成为一个拥有十三万人口的工业城市。今年入夏以来，连绵不断的暴雨造成市区内湖水位超过历年纪录，部分洼地和新建的工人住宅区积水。六月底，长江的第一个洪峰，更使这里的长江水位超过了历史最高纪录。中共黄石市委员会和市人民政府领导人民和洪水作了坚决的斗争，直到现在，大冶钢厂扩建工程和各厂矿仍克服着重重困难继续坚持生产。
    代表大会讨论了宋中洲的报告，一致通过决议，对政府的工作表示满意；并同意政府提出的加强防汛的各项具体措施。代表大会也一致拥护正在全国人民中广泛进行讨论的中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    黄石市工人占人口的多数。一百五十六名市人民代表中，产业工人当选为代表的就有六十三名。会议选出的十名湖北省人民代表中，有大冶钢厂劳动模范邱方仁、电厂劳动模范胡纪会和公私合营华新水泥厂水泥专家王涛等。（新华社）
