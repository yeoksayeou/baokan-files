Returning from Geneva
By Our Correspondent Wu Wentao

V. A "Whirlwind Tour"

Originally, I planned to visit Warsaw on the noon of July 26th, while Premier Zhou and comrades of the delegation were paying respects to the responsible comrades of the Polish Party and government, to see Warsaw which I hadn't seen for four years. However, due to the delay of the plane, it was almost dusk when I and several comrades arrived in Warsaw after the rain. The next day (July 27th) morning, the delegation, accompanied by responsible comrades of the Polish government and the chief engineer of Warsaw's reconstruction, visited the city after visiting the tractor factory in the suburbs. Regrettably, due to a temporary appointment, I missed the opportunity again.

At lunchtime, the delegation returned to the "Belweder" Palace residence. I saw Premier Zhou and other representatives and advisors talking as they walked, and they were still discussing with great interest the speed, scale, and planning of Warsaw's reconstruction, as well as the preservation and development of national forms in architecture. Obviously, Premier Zhou was very moved. He asked:

"Who is the poet? Write a poem!"

Using the two hours before the welcoming meeting of the people from all walks of life in Warsaw for Premier Zhou in the afternoon, I finally took a whirlwind tour of the new Warsaw of the people, naturally associating it with the scene when I first passed through Warsaw in 1947. Compared with the way it looked three or four years ago, Warsaw had already become more abundant, more beautiful, and more culturally rich.

In the summer of 1947, Warsaw was still beginning to heal its heavy wounds. More than 85 percent of the buildings were destroyed by German fascists during the war. In the evening, I followed the Chinese youth delegation that attended the first World Youth Festival held in Prague, and drove around the city. Some once prosperous areas were overgrown with weeds and uninhabited. When I went to Warsaw again in 1950, I hadn't heard of "Constitution Square" or the Palace of Culture and Science...; In the old city and the former Jewish residential area as reflected in the movie "A Street in Warsaw", workers were still diligently clearing the ruins; the huge Warsaw Automobile Factory still looked like it had just been laid...; Today, everything is different. What was planned in the past has now become a reality.

It is impossible to list all the countless new factories, state-owned stores, public institutions, and residential areas. The speed and scale of Warsaw's reconstruction... is a microcosm of Poland's socialist construction. In less than ten years, in terms of industrial production, Poland has risen from the 17th to the 5th place in Europe before the war. The Palace of Culture and Science, a gift from the Soviet people to the fraternal Polish people, which is more than 20 stories high, symbolizes the great selfless assistance of the Soviet government and people to the Polish people and other people's democratic countries in building their own motherland. The restoration of the Old Town Square in Warsaw—preserving the original architectural style and improving it—is a concrete manifestation of the Polish government and people's cherishing of national heritage. The present Warsaw and Poland prove what miracles people can make when they master their own destiny!

We admire "high-rise buildings rising from the ground," but at the same time, we have not forgotten that this is the result of the heroic Warsaw and Polish people working hard under the leadership of the United Workers' Party, after experiencing hardships, and disregarding the lack of this and that in life for a certain period, for the sake of free today and a happier tomorrow.

VI. The Highest Award

At 4:00 p.m. on July 27th, representatives from all walks of life in Warsaw gathered to welcome Premier Zhou and the Chinese delegation. The leader of the Polish people, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, Comrade Bierut, personally presided over the meeting. Amidst the continuous cheers of the audience, Premier Zhou recounted his deep impression of Warsaw's reconstruction work, and said: The glorious achievements of the Polish people in socialist construction are worthy of the Chinese people's learning. He thanked the Polish government and people for the help they have given to China in developing economic and cultural cooperation between China and Poland. From the Geneva Conference, he talked about the active contribution of the Polish government and people in restoring peace in Asia, and declared: Just as the Polish people care about peace in Asia, the Chinese people also care about the settlement of European issues. Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz also spoke.

At this time, Chairman Bierut invited Comrade Zawadzki, Chairman of the State Council of the People's Republic of Poland, to speak. At the end of his speech, he read out an order from the Polish State Council to the meeting, which stated:

"People's Republic of Poland

In order to express the brotherly friendship between the People's Republic of Poland and the People's Republic of China,
In order to commend his (Note: referring to Premier Zhou) achievements in the cause of lasting world peace,
In order to commend his achievements in strengthening the comprehensive cooperation and sincere friendship between the Chinese and Polish peoples,
The State Council of the People's Republic of Poland
Hereby awards the outstanding son of the Chinese people, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, the First Class Order of Rebirth of Poland." Below were the signatures of the Chairman and Secretary of the State Council.

It seemed that the masses present did not know in advance that there would be such a grand event at the meeting. When Chairman Zawadzki read the section "Awarded... Medal", the cheers of the masses suddenly came like a storm. Chairman Zawadzki personally pinned the medal on Premier Zhou's chest, put a red ribbon on him, and shook hands warmly. As in Berlin, Premier Zhou explained in his speech of thanks that this highest award of the People's Republic of Poland was mainly given to the Chinese people. By the end of the meeting, the masses chanted the names of the leaders beloved by the two peoples: "Bierut, Mao Zedong!" "Bierut, Mao Zedong!" It was very touching.

Two famous Polish song and dance troupes then performed a dozen wonderful programs. They sang "The East is Red" in correct Chinese; Zhou Xiaoyan, who is now in the Chinese cultural delegation in Warsaw, also sang a Chopin's "Maiden's Wish" in Polish, which made people feel like they were in Warsaw and Beijing. Yes, because of the common feelings and will, and because of the great allied country of the Soviet Union in the middle of the two countries, it makes us not only emotionally and willfully, but also geographically, without any distance.

VII. The Voice of Moscow

On the afternoon of July 28th, we flew to Moscow. Premier Zhou had arrived an hour earlier and began paying respects to the leading comrades of the great Soviet state.

Since we landed at the Central Airport in the city, when the plane circled over the airport, the Kremlin with the red star hanging high, the solemn and beautiful Moscow University, the verdant park, the shining Moscow River,... were colorful and clearly visible. This was the first time I was able to see the lovely Soviet capital from a high vantage point, and I naturally felt very lucky.

In the evening, at the banquet held by Foreign Minister Molotov to welcome Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Deputy Premier and Acting Foreign Minister Fan Wentong, I saw Comrade Malenkov. He was wearing a light gray suit, and together with Comrades Khrushchev, Voroshilov, and Molotov, he was talking happily and kindly with Soviet and foreign guests. There were diplomats and reporters from various countries in the East and West. The conversations and toasts I heard among the Soviets, and between them and foreign guests, mostly revolved around the achievements of the Geneva Conference, the negotiated settlement of all international disputes, the further relaxation of international tensions, peaceful coexistence based on mutual respect for national rights, and the achievement of a consolidated world peace. For example, people raised their glasses and, through French diplomats, conveyed their greetings to Mr. Mendès-France, who had played an active role in promoting peace in Indochina; and through British and Indian guests, they conveyed their greetings to Mr. Eden and Mr. Nehru, one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference. As long as they are willing to devote themselves to or help the cause of world peace, the Soviets are willing to cooperate with them sincerely. How open and aboveboard this is! During the three months in Geneva, the Soviet delegation led by Foreign Minister Molotov consistently conveyed this voice and will.

Since journalists were not allowed to enter the venue of the Geneva Conference, I had never seen Comrade Molotov as one of the chairmen and speaking at the meeting. However, people could always indirectly hear his voice. He warmly welcomed any small constructive suggestions; as long as the opinions of all parties were close, he advocated taking it as the basis for discussion in order to reach an agreement quickly... He used facts and irrefutable logic to embarrass Dulles, who was trying to sabotage the meeting, and to make Bidault, who followed the wishes of the United States, blush. Dulles and Bidault deceived themselves into thinking that the great Soviet Union's advocacy of negotiation was a "show of weakness", and that the "policy of strength" could still be peddled everywhere. They were stubborn, unrepentant, and only ended up being abandoned by world public opinion and attacked by the French people.

As reflected in the Moscow newspapers and repeatedly proposed by the Soviet government, there are still European and Asian... issues to be resolved through consultation today, which is also of concern to the Chinese people and the people of the world. The Geneva Conference has set a good example for the negotiated settlement of international disputes; if every participant who played an active role in Geneva should be commended, then Foreign Minister Molotov, who represents the voice of Moscow, the Soviet government and the will of the people, should be the first to be commended.

On the morning of the 29th, I followed the comrades of the delegation led by Premier Zhou to Red Square to lay wreaths at the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum to pay tribute, and to pay our respects to the remains of the two mentors of mankind, the dear friends of the Chinese people, and the founders of the Soviet regime and its peaceful foreign policy. The two giants lay peacefully in that granite mausoleum, each wearing the uniforms and marshal uniforms we are familiar with, making people feel that they are asleep, and their hearts are still beating...

In the evening, after attending the banquet held by Ambassador Zhang Wentian for Premier Zhou's visit to the Soviet Union and to celebrate our "August 1st" Army Day, we were busy preparing our luggage so that we could set off before dawn to fly to the last capital we would visit en route - Ulan Bator.

### 日内瓦归来

    日内瓦归来
    本报记者　吴文焘
    五、“走马看花”
    本来，我打算在七月二十六日中午到达华沙后，趁着周总理和代表团的同志们拜会波兰党政负责同志们的当儿，去游览一下四年未见的华沙。可是，由于飞机的耽搁，当我和几个同志到达时，雨后的华沙已近黄昏了。第二天（七月二十七日）上午，代表团由波兰政府的负责同志和重建华沙的总工程师陪同，在访问市郊拖拉机工厂之后参观市容；遗憾得很，由于一个临时的约会，我又错过了机会。
    吃中饭的时候，代表团回到“别维德尔”宫的寓所来。我看到周总理和其他代表与顾问同志们且走且谈，坐下来还在津津有味地谈论华沙重建的速度、规模、计划性以及在建筑中保存和发扬民族形式等问题。显然，周总理是很受感动的。他问：
  “谁是诗人？写一首诗吧！”
    利用下午华沙市各界人民代表欢迎周总理大会以前的两个小时，我终于走马看花般地看了看人民的新华沙，自然地联想到一九四七年我第一次路过华沙时的情景；就和三、四年前我看到的模样儿相比，华沙也已经变得更丰硕、更美丽、更富有文化了。
    一九四七年夏天，华沙还在开始医治它那惨重的创伤。百分之八十五以上的建筑都在战时被德国法西斯破坏了。傍晚，我跟着当时出席在布拉格举行的第一届世界青年联欢节的中国青年代表团，在市区绕行一周；若干战前繁华之区，竟是蒿草丛生，寂无人烟了。一九五○年我再到华沙时，还没有听说什么“宪法广场”、科学文化宫……；在旧城区和像电影“华沙一条街”里所反映的过去犹太人民居住区，工人们还多在辛勤地清理着废墟；巨大的华沙汽车制造厂还像是刚在奠基……；今天，一切都不同了。过去在计划中的，现在已经成为现实了。
    无法一一列举那无数新的工厂、国营商店、公共机关和住宅区。华沙重建的速度、规模……，就是波兰全国社会主义建设的一个缩影。不到十年，按照工业生产量来说，波兰已由战前欧洲的第十七位升为第五位了。那座高达二十余层的、作为苏联人民对于兄弟波兰人民的礼物的科学文化宫，象征着伟大的苏联政府和人民对于波兰人民和其他人民民主国家在建设自己祖国中的巨大无私的援助。华沙旧城广场区的修复——保留着原有的建筑形式并加以提高，是波兰政府和人民珍重民族遗产的具体表现。华沙和波兰的今天，证明当人民掌握了自己的命运时，他们会作出怎样的奇迹来！
    我们赞赏“万丈高楼平地起”，但同时也没有忘记：这是英雄的华沙和波兰人民在经历风霜后、在一定时期内不顾生活上缺少这个、短少那个，为了自由的今天，为了更幸福的明天，在统一工人党领导下努力奋斗的结果。
    六、最高的奖励
    七月二十七日下午四时，华沙各界人民代表集会欢迎周总理和中国代表团。波兰人民的领袖、波兰统一工人党第一书记贝鲁特同志亲自主持。周总理在听众不断欢呼中，讲述了他对华沙重建工作的深刻印象，并说：波兰人民在建设社会主义中的光辉成就是值得中国人民学习的。他感谢了波兰政府和人民在发展中、波间经济文化合作上所给予中国的帮助。从日内瓦会议，他谈到波兰政府和人民在恢复亚洲和平中的积极贡献，并宣称：正像波兰人民的关心亚洲和平一样，中国人民同样关心着欧洲问题的解决。波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹接着也讲了话。
    这时，主席贝鲁特同志请波兰人民共和国国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基同志讲话。他的讲话的末尾，是向到会群众宣读波兰国务委员会的一项命令，内称：
      “波兰人民共和国
    为了表达波兰人民共和国与中华人民共和国间的兄弟之谊，
    为了表扬他（按：指周总理）在世界持久和平事业中的功绩，
    为了他在加强中、波两国人民的全面合作与真挚友谊中的功绩，
    波兰人民共和国国务委员会
    特授予中国人民的优秀儿子、中华人民共和国总理兼外交部部长周恩来一级波兰复兴勋章。”下面是国务委员会主席和秘书的签字。
    似乎，到会的群众事先并不知道在会议上有这样一个盛举。当萨瓦茨基主席读到“授予……勋章”一节时，群众的欢腾像暴风雨般地突然袭来。萨瓦茨基主席亲自将勋章佩在周总理胸前，给他带上一条红色的彩绸，并热烈握手。和在柏林时一样，周总理在致谢词中说明这个波兰人民共和国的最高奖励，主要是给予中国人民的。到大会结束时，群众高呼两国人民敬爱的领袖的名字：“贝鲁特、毛泽东！”、“贝鲁特、毛泽东！”十分动人。
    两个有名的波兰歌舞团接着表演了十来个精采节目。他们用正确的中文歌唱了“东方红”；现在华沙的中国文化代表团里的周小燕，也用波语唱了一支萧邦的“少女之歌”，这使人有似在华沙又似在北京之感。是的，由于有着共同的情感和意志，由于有着两国共同的伟大盟邦苏联在中间，就使我们不仅在情感上、意志上而且也在地理上没有任何距离可言了。
  七、莫斯科的声音
    七月二十八日下午，我们飞抵莫斯科，周总理已于一小时前到达，并开始了对于伟大苏维埃国家领导同志们的拜会。
    由于这次我们是在城区的中央机场降落的，所以当飞机在机场上空盘旋时，高挂着红星的克里姆林宫、庄严美丽的莫斯科大学、苍翠的公园、闪着光亮的莫斯科河，……五颜六色，历历在目。这是我第一次得以高瞻远瞩地看到那可爱的苏维埃京城，心情自然是倍觉幸运的。
    晚间，在莫洛托夫外长举行的欢迎周恩来总理兼外长和范文同副总理兼代外长的宴会上，我看到了马林科夫同志。他穿着一身淡灰色的西装，和赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、莫洛托夫等同志一起，愉快、和蔼地和苏联的、外国的来宾们晤谈着。这里有着东西方各国的外交家和记者们。我所听到的苏维埃人彼此间、同外国来宾间的谈话和举杯祝福的声音，大都是围绕着日内瓦会议的成就，围绕着协商解决一切国际争端、进一步缓和国际紧张局势，在互相尊重民族权利下和平共处、达到巩固的世界和平这样的题目。例如：人们举着杯子，通过法国的外交家们，向在促成印度支那和平中起了积极作用的孟戴斯—弗朗斯先生致意；通过英国和印度的来宾，向日内瓦会议的主席之一——艾登先生和尼赫鲁先生致意。只要愿意致力或有助于世界和平事业的，苏维埃人都愿诚心诚意地同他们合作。这是多么光明磊落啊！在日内瓦的三个月里，莫洛托夫外长所领导的苏联代表团，就是一贯传达着这种声音和意志的。
      由于新闻记者不能进入日内瓦会议的会场，我从未看到过作为主席之一的、和在会场上发言的莫洛托夫同志。但是，人们每次总可以间接地听到他的声音的。不管任何微小的带建设性的意见，他都热忱地予以欢迎；只要各方面的意见接近了，他就主张把它作为讨论的基础，以期迅速达到协议……。他用事实和不可辩驳的逻辑，曾使以破坏会议为目的的杜勒斯十分尴尬，也曾使奉行美国意旨的皮杜尔面红耳赤。杜勒斯和皮杜尔们自欺欺人地以为伟大苏联的主张协商就是“示弱”，以为“实力政策”还可以到处兜售，顽固不化，执迷不悟，只有落得为全世界舆论所共弃，为法国人民群起而攻之了。
    正如莫斯科的报纸上所反映的和苏联政府所一再提出的，今天还有欧洲的、亚洲的……问题有待协商解决，这也是中国人民和全世界人民所关心的。日内瓦会议已经给协商解决国际争端树下了良好的范例；如果每一个在日内瓦起了积极作用的与会者都应当受到推崇的话，那么，代表莫斯科的声音、苏维埃政府和人民意志的莫洛托夫外长，是首先应当受到推崇的。
    二十九日上午，我随着由周总理率领的代表团同志们去红场的列宁—斯大林墓献花圈致敬，并瞻仰两位人类的导师、中国人民的挚友、苏维埃政权及其和平外交政策的缔造者的遗容。两位巨人安详地躺在那花岗石的陵寝里，各自穿着我们所熟悉的制服和元帅服，使人感到他们是在入睡了，心脏还在跳动着……。
    晚间，参加过张闻天大使为周总理访问苏联并庆祝我国“八一”建军节举行的宴会，我们就忙着准备行装，好在黎明前动身飞向中途访问的最后一个首都——乌兰巴托去。　（下次续完）
