Farmers in Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces Enthusiastically Sell Early Rice

Early rice has been harvested in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. This year, many areas in these two provinces have achieved a bumper harvest of early rice. In the Jiulong River basin, a major rice-producing area in Fujian Province, counties such as Longxi and Haicheng have generally increased early rice production by more than 10%, with some areas increasing by 20% to 30%. In Zhejiang Province, continuous cropping of early rice in counties such as Yuhuan and Wenling can yield more than 500 jin per mu in good fields, and generally more than 400 jin per mu.

Currently, farmers are enthusiastically selling newly harvested early rice to the state. The purchase volume of rice by state grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Fujian Province is increasing daily, with mid-July increasing approximately three times compared to early July. Currently, Haicheng County alone purchases 600,000 jin of early rice every day. In Zhejiang Province, Huangyan County's daily purchase volume of early rice is also over 500,000 jin. (Cheng Hua)

    福建浙江两省农民踊跃出卖早稻
    福建、浙江两省早稻已经登场。今年这两省的不少地区早稻获得丰收。福建省主要产稻区九龙江流域的龙溪、海澄等县，早稻普遍增产一成以上，个别地区增产二成到三成。浙江省玉环、温岭等县的连作早稻，每亩好的能收五百多斤，一般能收四百多斤。
    目前，农民正踊跃将新收早稻卖给国家，福建省国家粮食部门和供销合作社的稻谷收购量正日渐增加，七月中旬就比上旬增加约三倍。现在仅海澄一县，每天就收购早稻六十万斤。浙江省黄岩县每天的早稻收购量，也在五十万斤以上。（程华）
