    Jiangsu Province State-Owned Department Store System
    Improves Autumn and Winter Goods Processing and Ordering

    The Jiangsu Province State-Owned Department Store System's processing and purchasing plan for autumn and winter goods this year has expanded compared to previous years, and the variety of designs and colors is even richer. In order to improve processing and ordering work, the Nanjing City Company of the China Department Store Corporation established a commodity research group. This research group is responsible for collecting consumer opinions and helping processors and factory workers improve designs and colors. The Wuxi Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store Corporation convened symposiums of relevant manufacturers to study the variety and colors of processed products. At the same time, the station also sent samples of Guangzhou-produced drawnwork pillowcases, new-style socks, and other items to manufacturers in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, and other places, so they could imitate and produce them. In processing and ordering, the Jiangsu Province State-Owned Department Store System also strengthened finished product inspection and cost auditing. The cost of bed sheets produced in Changzhou was reduced by 7 percent after auditing.

    In mid-June, the Wuxi Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store Corporation had already transferred the first batch of autumn and winter goods to Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, Lanzhou, Xinjiang, Xi'an, Hankou, Shijiazhuang, and other places.

    江苏省国营百货系统
    改进秋冬用品加工订货工作
    江苏省国营百货系统今年秋冬季用品的加工、收购计划比往年扩大了，花色品种比往年更为丰富。为了改进加工、订货工作，中国百货公司南京市公司成立了商品研究组。这个研究组负责搜集消费者的意见，帮助加工员、工厂工人等改进花色品种。中国百货公司无锡采购供应站曾召集有关厂商座谈，研究加工产品的品种和花色。同时，该站还将广州出产的抽花枕套、新式袜子等多种样品送给无锡、苏州、常州等地的厂商，让他们仿照生产。江苏省国营百货系统在加工、订货中，还加强了成品检验和成本审核工作。常州出产的被单的成本，经过核算降低了百分之七。
    六月中旬，中国百货公司无锡采购供应站已经把第一批秋冬季用品调运到牡丹江、佳木斯、兰州、新疆、西安、汉口、石家庄等地。
