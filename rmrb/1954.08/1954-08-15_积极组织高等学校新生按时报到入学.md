    Actively Organize New College Students to Register and Enroll on Time

    The 1954 national college and university new student admission lists, except for those in the Central South region, are being announced today. The current important task is to actively organize admitted students to register and enroll on time.

    To do this work well, we must first educate new students to obey the state's planned allocation, especially those who applied for fewer of the teacher training, Russian, geology, mining, meteorology, and physical education specialties this year but were assigned more by the state plan. We must emphasize to them that these specialties are indispensable for national construction. New students assigned to specialties needed by the motherland have a glorious task and should not hesitate to register and enroll. We must also explain to the admitted on-the-job cadres that they should not fail to register simply because they already have fixed jobs that match their wishes. If they do so, it will not only disrupt the state's original enrollment plan but also deprive themselves of the opportunity for further study, which is not good for either the country or themselves. We should help new students establish an overall concept, recognize that all national construction undertakings are important, that learning each specialty has a bright future, and consciously make their personal enrollment wishes obey the state enrollment plan.

    When educating new students to register and enroll on time, we must use specific examples and patient persuasion methods based on the new students' specific ideological situations to truly solve their ideological problems. We must not talk about general principles in isolation from the new students' specific thoughts, and especially not arbitrarily label new students.

    Secondly, the transportation and living difficulties of new students during registration and enrollment should be properly resolved. There has been too much rain in various places this year, and transportation is not very convenient, and there are crowded cars and ships. More than 94,000 new students, scattered in 78 examination areas across the country, have to register and enroll in various colleges and universities in a short period of half a month, which is not a simple matter. All relevant parties should actively assist in solving the problem of transportation for new students on their way to school. Necessary subsidies should be provided for the travel expenses of students whose families are indeed poor. Local enrollment agencies, Communist Youth League organizations, and student unions of various schools should educate new students to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship and unite to overcome various difficulties on the journey so that they can arrive at their destinations on time to register and enroll.

    Local enrollment agencies and relevant parties should also educate the candidates who were not admitted this year so that they recognize that they were not admitted this year because they have not yet met the admission requirements. As long as they study hard in the future, they will have the opportunity to apply again in the future. On-the-job cadres who have not been admitted should return to their original agencies and work with peace of mind. The leaders of various agencies should treat them warmly and make appropriate arrangements for their work, and should not refuse to take care of them or adopt a cold attitude towards them. As for young students and social intellectuals who have not been admitted, they should find jobs on their own, work and study at the same time, and strive to improve their level.

    Organizing new students to register and enroll on time is the last task in this year's enrollment work. All relevant parties must earnestly do this work well to ensure that this year's enrollment plan is completed on time and in full.

### 积极组织高等学校新生按时报到入学

    积极组织高等学校新生按时报到入学
    一九五四年度全国高等学校新生录取名单除中南区外都在今天公布了。当前的重要工作，就是要积极地组织录取新生按时报到入学。
    要做好这一工作，首先必须向新生进行服从国家计划分配的教育，特别要对今年志愿报考较少而由国家计划分配较多的师范、俄文、地质、采矿、气象、体育等专业的新生进行这种教育，向他们着重说明这些专业是国家建设不可缺少的专业，被分配到祖国需要的专业去的新生，都是负有光荣的任务，应该毫不犹豫地报到入学。还要向被录取的在职干部说明，不要因为自己已经有了固定的工作岗位，合于自己的志愿就入学，否则就不去报到。假如这样做，那不仅会打乱国家原定的招生计划，而且会使自己贻误入学深造的机会，对国家对自己都没有好处。应该帮助新生树立整体观念，认识国家各项建设事业都很重要，学习各个专业都有美好前途，自觉地使个人入学志愿服从国家招生计划。
    在对新生进行按时报到入学的教育时，要根据新生的具体思想情况，用具体事例，采取耐心说服教育的方法，真正解决新生的思想问题，而不要脱离新生的具体思想泛泛地讲述一般的道理，尤其不能随便给新生扣大帽子。
    其次，新生报到入学时的交通困难和生活困难，应当妥善解决。今年各地雨水太多，交通不大方便，车船较为拥挤，而散布在全国七十八个考区的九万四千多名新生，要在短短的半个月内，到各个高等学校报到入学，不是一件很简单的事情。各有关方面应该积极协助解决新生入学途中的交通工具问题。对于那些家庭确实贫苦的学生，其旅费应给予必要的补助。各地招生机构、青年团组织和各校学生会，应教育新生发扬互助友爱精神，团结一致地克服旅途上的各种困难，以便按时到达目的地报到入学。
    各地招生机构和有关方面还应该教育今年未被录取的考生，使他们认识，今年没有考取，是因为自己尚未具备入学条件，只要今后努力进修，将来还有报考的机会。未被录取的在职干部应该回到原机关安心工作，各机关的领导方面对他们应该热诚相待，对他们的工作要作适当安排，不要拒绝不管或对他们采取冷淡态度。至于未被录取的青年学生和社会知识青年，应当自找职业，一面工作，一面进修，努力提高自己的水平。
    组织新生按时报到入学，是今年招生工作中的最后一项工作，各有关方面必须切实作好这项工作，以保证按时全部完成今年的招生计划。
