Organize Enterprise Inspection Work Better
    An Gang
    In factories or construction sites, one often hears cadres complaining, "What gives us the biggest headache is dealing with inspectors sent down by higher authorities." When told, "It's no wonder, inspection work is always a headache," they retort, "No, this is a different kind of headache." Summarizing what everyone says, it boils down to the following points:
    "Some higher-level organs (provincial and municipal committees, or business leadership departments) rarely conduct comprehensive and systematic inspections of factory work. However, there are too many piecemeal inspections. Each inspector (or group) focuses on a single issue in isolation. Today, someone comes to inspect material supply; tomorrow, someone comes to inspect accounting budgets; the day after, someone comes to inspect personnel education. A factory can have several different inspection groups at the same time. You discover one problem, they discover another. What the factory's main problems are, no one seems to care about. Inspectors come from all directions, and the issues they inspect are all different. No matter who it is, they first go to the factory and relevant departments to ask for information, plans, and summaries, and then go to the workshops to understand how the workshops are implementing them. One isn't finished before another arrives.
    "If responsible comrades or people proficient in the business come to inspect, it is generally of great help to the factory, and the factory welcomes them. However, responsible comrades rarely come down. Even if someone does, they only take a look and don't really inspect. Most of the inspectors sent are young, enthusiastic comrades, but they lack analytical skills and practical experience. One inspector went to a construction site to inspect work and asked, "Between the site director and the political director, who has more power?" These questions are laughable. Some comrades, seeing something or hearing some fragmentary remarks, immediately write them down in their notebooks without thinking and report them to the higher authorities. We dare not treat these comrades carelessly, fearing that they will report to the higher authorities that we "do not respect leadership." However, we always feel that talking to them won't solve any problems.
    "We have three or four work groups or inspection groups stationed in our factory. Some have been inspecting for three months and haven't found anything significant. Some people have written a lot of inspection materials and handed them over to the higher authorities. We don't know what these materials are used for, but they don't help the factory in any way. Some inspection groups come with great fanfare, with an outline as thick as a book. The entire factory cadre is mobilized to work around the inspection, but after some time, the inspectors suddenly disappear, and there is no follow-up on the inspection results."
    These are some reflections from factory comrades on inspection work. It should be pointed out that this is only one aspect of the problem. Our inspection work has been gradually strengthened and improved. Inspection work is of decisive significance for improving enterprise leadership. The main shortcomings of our inspection work are the lack of a mature set of experiences. Everyone is still exploring enterprise management. Of course, the methods of inspection work are sometimes inevitably not quite right. It should also be pointed out that some comrades in factories have a complacent attitude, always thinking that they are doing not too badly. They adopt a resistant attitude towards the inspection work of the higher authorities, not offering goodwill assistance but finding fault, which is wrong.
    The question now is: How can inspections of factories be most effective?
    I had the opportunity to learn about some situations in which the Soviet Union inspected a factory, some of which are quite valuable for us to improve our inspection work.
    The Soviet Union has many methods of inspecting factories. One method is a comprehensive annual inspection of certain factories by the leading organs. The inspection teams sent to inspect the factories are very authoritative. When the inspection team arrives at the factory, people are not afraid or flustered, but rather excited. Everyone is happy to present their achievements and shortcomings and mistakes to the higher authorities, and through the inspection, the work of their department takes a step forward.
    Where do the comrades of the inspection team go first when they arrive at the factory?
    They don't spend time holding large and small meetings to listen to reports, nor do they reach out for summary materials, let alone have the production staff stop working to accompany them. Before they set off, they have already thoroughly studied all the written materials related to the factory. When they arrive at the factory, they immediately plunge into the actual life of the factory.
    In the factory director's office, the inspection team members live with the factory director, observing the director's daily work. Here, the inspectors personally come into contact with the various problems that are concentrated on the director every day, and they also see concretely how the director, as the fully empowered leader of the enterprise, solves problems. The inspectors are not bystanders. They jointly study and solve some complex problems with the director. The inspecting comrades specifically tell the director the principles of the higher leading organs for handling some problems, helping the director to improve his working ability. The person in charge of the inspection team working with the factory director can make the inspection work completely in sync with the factory's life. Everything that needs to be done in the inspection is handled through the factory director. The inspection work is not done separately, and it will not disrupt the factory's order. The inspection work proceeds along with the factory's production activities, and it will not delay people's production time.
    Inspectors also came to the various departments. For example, the person who went to the accounting department did not listen to reports, but first looked at the documents and various original vouchers, not picking important documents to look at, but looking at each one, checking each number. Some of the documents were blurred, and the inspection team directly called the shipping agency to check the accounts. In one document, the decimal point of the unit number of the item was wrong. The inspecting comrades spent more than a day comparing it in many ways before finally figuring it out. The people who went to the labor and wage department to inspect did not look at plans or summaries. They first looked at the work tickets to see whether the payment of wages conformed to the state's prescribed working hour quota standards. If, during the inspection, it was found that a certain job was stipulated by the state to be six hours, but the work ticket calculated it as eight hours, and the workers were paid two hours of extra wages, then the inspectors would record it, and the person responsible for controlling the wages would compensate for the loss. The inspection of original vouchers is the most direct and effective inspection, and any major or minor negligence and errors in the work can be checked out. This kind of inspection can greatly improve the staff's sense of responsibility for their work.
    Inspectors also came to the workshops. They did not hold any meetings, nor did they ask the workshop director for a report. They quietly conducted inspections according to the production procedures, ran to the machines to watch the workers operate, talked to the workers during breaks, and checked the various original records of the workshop. Their observations were very meticulous. The inspectors studied the cartoons drawn by the workshop workers, various charts, talked to the workers, listened carefully to all the workers' opinions, and recorded everything in detail, whether it was a big problem or a small problem.
    Inspectors came to the warehouse. They did not ask the materials department or the warehouse manager for a list of warehouse inventory. They checked each item one by one from the first shelf, recorded each one, and made a list from beginning to end. Then they asked the warehouse manager to bring the inventory list for comparison. If the two lists were completely consistent, the inspection would turn to studying the material supply situation. If there was something wrong in one place, there would be a second inspection. If something was missing, it would be recorded, and the head of the materials department and the warehouse manager would be held liable. If there was too much? The problem would be even bigger, and they would investigate in many ways to see if he had any hidden behavior.
    Inspectors came to the cafeteria. They carefully looked at the workers' nutritional conditions and the cafeteria's hygiene conditions. Someone also went to inspect the toilets. A Soviet comrade said: "In places where the working class is collectively active, never regard the toilet as a small problem. If it is not done well, it will make the workers look bad." Inspectors also came to the workers' dormitories. The factory director accompanied the inspectors to see the workers' living conditions, whether the bedding was clean, whether the collective dormitory had a place to rest, and asked whether families with many children had any difficulties. All of this looks simple, but it is not. They are not generally inspecting living phenomena. This is to inspect the factory's implementation of the collective contract, to inspect whether the factory has properly taken care of the material conditions to ensure that the workers can do a good job. The collective contract is a good standard for factory inspection work. If the satisfaction of workers' demands exceeds the provisions of the collective contract (that is, exceeds the development of production), this is called economism. If the leadership only wants the workers to work but does not implement the improvement of labor conditions and welfare measures stipulated in the collective contract, this is called bureaucratism.
    Someone inspected every corner.
    From the first day of the inspection, the factory's daily life has undergone positive changes. This can be seen from some "small problems."
    "Factory workers don't get enough rest, meetings should be reduced," this was an opinion from a comrade inspecting the factory office. The comrades in charge of political work studied and found that this was indeed the case. This was quickly changed after the inspection.
    "A place to rest should be provided for the workers," sure enough, the factory allocated an open space with trees, and everyone used voluntary labor to build a cultural rest park.
    The kitchen cooks also began to have physical examinations....
    There are many similar situations, which shows that inspection work is a huge driving force. It brings fresh air to the factory's tense life.
    Comrade Stalin said at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "Well-organized review of implementation work is like a searchlight, which can help to identify the working conditions of various organs at any time and expose bureaucrats and formalists at any time. It can be asserted that nine-tenths of our shortcomings and defects are due to the lack of well-organized review of implementation work. There is no doubt that if there is such a well-organized review of implementation work, then shortcomings and defects will certainly be prevented in advance."
    What is a well-organized inspection?
    A well-organized inspection must be personally led by a leading comrade and participated in by an inspection team with experienced people. The number of people participating in the inspection does not have to be large, but they should be "experts" as much as possible. They are very familiar with the factory situation and can plunge into life as soon as they arrive at the factory. The higher-level organs should have a group of experienced and capable inspection staff (not necessarily full-time) "under their control to inspect the progress of actual work" (Lenin). Such experienced and capable staff can be cultivated in two ways: one is to be assumed by comrades who originally held certain responsible positions in the factory; the other is to train some talents who specialize in inspecting a certain issue. I remember that Anshan Iron and Steel Company once sent a technical staff member who had studied factory reports to the machinery factory to specialize in inspecting and studying reports. He not only found problems, but also helped the factory to study a plan to improve the forms, reducing the original reports by one-third, saving the factory a lot of time. Such inspectors are very popular with factory comrades. We should try as much as possible not to send or send fewer inexperienced cadres to inspect. The leading organs should help these comrades familiarize themselves with certain practical experience and business knowledge internally, and politically improve their ability to investigate and research.
    A well-organized inspection should implement a planned and purposeful inspection, rather than a superficial "touching" of problems. Some of our inspection groups have to spend half a month just to familiarize themselves with the situation when they arrive at the factory. This blindfolded approach is not very effective and has a great impact on production. Therefore, full preparations must be made before the inspection, and a clear inspection plan must be formulated. The Soviet comrades I saw had carefully studied all the materials of the factory within the leading organs before inspecting a factory. They not only knew what problems the factory had, but also had certain opinions on how to improve the factory's work. As soon as they arrived at the factory, they went deep into life to find first-hand materials, and based on these materials, they made inspection conclusions. The sources of first-hand materials are a large number of daily original vouchers, original records, a large number of facts existing in actual production and life, and mass voices from the bottom up with universal significance. Some of our inspection groups are only satisfied with some transferred and copied materials, and dare not boldly doubt some summary reports and report materials of the factory. Even if they feel that the other party is not saying the right thing, they have no way to convince them. If we want to make inspection work effective, we must strictly follow the principle: "To check the degree of implementation, we must first analyze and judge at the work site based on the actual results of the work execution, and not be swayed by those reports that affect our independent judgment." Some factories often have such an opinion of the inspectors: "They come and ask us to talk, ask us to write materials, and take away a large number of our summary reports and materials when they leave. Then the people who come next still want those things, it's really impossible." If we conduct an independent inspection based on the actual results of the work execution, then it will become another situation, and the factory will feel that the inspection group's materials are much better than theirs, and they will ask the inspection group to leave the materials for the factory.
    A well-organized inspection requires the implementation of the spirit of criticism and self-criticism in the inspection, ruthlessly exposing shortcomings and finding ways to correct them. Some factory cadres often have such disputes with the inspectors. Some factory cadres say: "The inspectors only look at problems from the perspective of shortcomings, which is one-sided." The inspectors believe: "If we look at problems from the perspective of advantages, isn't this also one-sided?" These two people's statements are wrong, but the conclusion is correct. Whether inspecting from the perspective of shortcomings or advantages will lead to one-sided conclusions. Our inspection work is to inspect the degree of implementation, and it must be objective, realistic, and strict. If the criticisms are always of this type: "I think you haven't done enough in this area," "There seem to be more serious shortcomings in this area," "It has been basically implemented, but there are still many places that have not been implemented," "It is generally good, but there are still many shortcomings." These criticisms cannot really convince people, and are even prone to some subjective elements. The inspectors should let the facts speak for themselves, not first put on a hat and then use examples to embellish the hat. They should seize a large number of universal facts, analyze them, and form an unbreakable conclusion. If the inspection is objective, then it is also fair and strict. When some of our inspection groups go to advanced factories to inspect, they first have a preconceived notion of "advanced" in their minds. Therefore, in the inspection, they are always afraid of conflicting with this "advanced" concept. Sometimes they clearly see some things that are not right, but they also feel: "Compared to the advanced nature of this factory, these are small things." Such an inspection is not objective, and therefore cannot be fair and strict. This kind of view of avoiding shortcomings is almost no different from fraud and malfeasance, because for the inspectors, they must measure everything from the standpoint of the interests of the Party and the state. No matter what place you are, what kind of person you are, if there are shortcomings or mistakes, then they should not be concealed but should be exposed, they should not be tolerated but should be strictly investigated, otherwise it is a lack of concern and disloyalty to the interests of the state, and will guide the enterprise departments to the anti-Party road of concealing shortcomings and exaggerating achievements. The so-called strictness of inspection is fundamentally different from the inspector being arrogant, making people awe-inspiring, or the imperial envoy's style. The concentrated expression of strictness is to adhere to the interests of the state and safeguard the laws of the state, and not to allow the interests of the state to be harmed in the slightest.
    A well-organized inspection will play a positive role in consolidating the system of one-man management and improving the level of production management. The inspecting comrades do not stand aside and point fingers, but analyze all the shortcomings found according to their different natures. All those that can be corrected within the enterprise are directly suggested to the factory director or the Party committee. If the factory director or the Party committee agrees, they will be immediately implemented in the form of orders or resolutions. All those that need to be resolved by the higher-level organs are submitted to the higher-level organs for resolution according to the severity and urgency of the problems. Inspection is not "settling the final accounts," but "clearing the accounts." It helps the factory director and organizations at all levels to correct shortcomings in a timely manner. Will this hinder the leadership principle of one-man management? No, because all the suggestions submitted to the factory director and workshop director are what they should have done but did not do. Since they have been found out during the inspection and corrected in a timely manner, this reduces various errors in the work, thereby consolidating leadership prestige and improving management level.
    Implementing regular comprehensive inspections of some major factories will yield greater results than sporadic and scattered inspections, because factory activity is an organic whole. Through comprehensive inspections, higher-level organs can comprehensively understand the factory's activities and discover the factory's main problems from the internal connections of things, and can also solve secondary problems at the same time. At present, it is impossible for us to have the same proficient inspection capabilities as the Soviet comrades, but if we can organize the existing forces for individual inspections of factories to gain experience, this may be of greater help to the factories, and the hindrance to production will definitely be less.

    把检查企业的工作组织得更好些
    安岗
    在工厂或工地里，常常听到一些工厂或工地干部反映：“我们最头疼的是应付上级派下来的某些检查工作的人。”人们告诉他们说，“这也难怪，检查工作就是头痛的事”，他们说：“不是的。这是另外一种头痛。”综合大家所谈，不外以下几点：
    “有些上级机关（省、市委，或业务领导部门）对工厂工作很少全面系统的检查，可是，零星的检查又太多，每一个来检查的人（或组）都是孤立地搞一个问题，今天来的是检查材料供应，明天来的是检查会计预算，后天来的是检查人事教育，一个工厂同时可以有好几个不同的检查组在检查。你也发现一个问题，他也发现一个问题，到底什么是工厂的主要问题，反倒没有人管。检查的人来自四面八方，检查的问题各有一套。无论什么人，都要先找厂部及有关的科室要情况、计划和总结，然后再到车间去了解车间是怎样执行的。一个未完，另一个又来了。
    “如果是负责同志或是精通本门业务的人来检查，一般都对工厂有很大的帮助，工厂是欢迎的。但是，负责同志很少下来，即便有人下来也只是看看，谈不到检查。派来检查的人大半是年轻、有热情，但没有分析能力和实际经验的同志，有一个检查人员到工地去检查工作，他问：“工地主任同政治主任两个人比起来，那一个人权力大？”这些问题问得令人发笑。有些同志看见一件事，听到一些片言只语不加思索，就急忙记在本子上，回去给上级作汇报。我们对这些同志不敢慢待，怕他反映给上级，说是“不尊重领导”，可是，总觉得跟他谈了也解决不了什么问题。
    “我们工厂住上了三四个工作组、检查组，有的检查了三个月，还没有检查出一个名堂。有的人写了不少检查材料，都交给了上边，这些材料干什么用，我们也不知道，反正对工厂没有帮助。有的检查组来的时候声势浩大，提纲就有一个本本厚，整个工厂干部都动员起来围绕着检查来搞工作，可是，过了一些时候，忽然看不见检查的人了，检查结果也没有个下文。”
    这是一些工厂同志对检查工作的反映。应当指出：这只是问题的一方面，我们的检查工作是逐步加强逐步提高了的，检查工作对改进企业领导是有决定意义的。我们检查工作的缺点主要的是缺乏一套成熟的经验，大家对企业管理都还在摸索，当然，检查工作的方法，也就有时不免搞得不对头。还应当指出，工厂有些同志有自满情绪，总以为自己干得还不坏，对上级检查工作的人采取一种抗拒的态度，不是善意的帮助而是嫌麻烦，甚至找小毛病，这是不对的。
    现在的问题是：怎样对工厂进行检查才能最有效呢？
    我曾有机会了解苏联检查一个工厂的一些情况，其中有些地方对我们改进检查工作颇有参考价值。
    苏联检查工厂方法很多。方法之一是领导机关对某些工厂一年一次的全面的检查。派去检查工厂的检查团是很有威信的，在检查团到工厂时，人们不是害怕、张惶，而是振奋，大家乐于把自己的成果和工作的缺点错误摆在上级的面前，通过检查使本部门工作向前迈进一步。
    检查团同志到工厂，他们先到什么地方呢？
    他们没有花费时间去开大会小会听汇报，也没有伸手要总结材料，更没有让搞生产的人停下工作来陪着他们。他们在出发前早已透彻研究了一切有关这个工厂的书面材料。他们来到工厂后马上就投入到工厂实际生活中去。
    在厂长室，检查团的人员同厂长生活在一起，观察厂长一天的工作。检查的人在这里亲自接触到工厂一天集中到厂长那里去的各种问题，也具体地看到厂长这个企业全权领导者是怎样解决问题。检查人员不是旁观者，他跟厂长共同研究解决一些复杂问题，检查的同志把上级领导机关对一些问题的处理原则具体地告诉厂长，帮助厂长提高工作能力。检查团负责人同厂长在一起工作，可以使检查工作与工厂生活完全合拍，一切检查上需要作的事情都通过厂长去办，检查工作不是另搞一套，也就不会打乱工厂的秩序。检查工作沿着工厂生产活动来进行，也就不会耽搁人们的生产时间。
    各科里，也来了检查团的人员。譬如，到会计科去的人，他不听汇报，而是先看单据和各种原始凭证，不是拣重要的单据看，而是一张一张地看，一个数字一个数字地查对。有的单据模糊不清，检查团就直接打电话问发货机关查账，有一个单据物品计算单位数字点错了小数点，检查同志费了一天多时间多方对照，最后才算弄清。到劳动工资科去检查的人也不看计划或总结，他们先看工作票，看看工资的支付是否合乎国家规定的工时定额标准，如在检查中发现有一件工作国家规定是六小时，工作票算成了八小时，多给工人开了两小时的工资，这时，检查的人就记下来，由负责掌握工资的人赔偿损失。原始凭证的检查是一种最直接最有效的检查，任何工作上的大小疏忽和错误都可以从中查对出来。这种检查可以大大提高工作人员对工作的负责精神。
    在车间，也来了检查人员。他们没有召开什么会议，也没有找车间主任汇报，他们不声不响地按照生产程序进行考察，跑到机器旁边看工人操作，跟休息中的工人谈话，查看车间的各种原始纪录。他们的观察是非常细致的，检查人员研究车间工人画的漫画，各种图表。跟工人谈话，仔细倾听工人的一切意见，对于无论是大问题或是小问题都要详细记下来。
    仓库里来了检查人员，他们并不向材料科或是管库员要仓库存货清单。他们从第一个货架起逐件地检查各种物品，查一个记一个，从头到尾作成清单，然后才叫管库员把存货清单拿过来对照；如果两个清单完全符合，检查就转入研究材料供应的情况，如果有一处不对头，就来第二次检查，少了，就记下来，由材料科长及管库员包赔，多了呢？问题就更大了，他们就要多方面调查，看他是不是有打埋伏的行为。
    食堂里，来了检查人员，他们细心地看工人的营养条件及食堂的卫生条件。厕所也有人去检查，一位苏联同志说：“在工人阶级集体活动的场合里，永远不要把厕所看成是一个小问题，搞得不好，这是要给工人出洋相的。”工人宿舍里也来了检查人员，厂长陪着检查的人看工人居住条件，看被褥是否清洁，集体宿舍有没有一个休息场所，询问多子女家属有没有困难。这一切看起来很简单，其实不然，他们不是一般地检查生活现象，这是检查工厂对集体合同的执行情况，检查工厂是否弄好了保证工人作好工作的物质条件。集体合同是工厂检查工作的一个很好的标准。如果对工人要求的满足超过了集体合同的规定（也即是超过了生产的发展），这就叫作经济主义，如果，领导上只是要工人干活而不去实现集体合同上所规定改善劳动条件及福利措施，这就叫作官僚主义。
    任何一个角落都有人检查。
    从检查的第一天起，工厂每天的生活都有了积极的变化。这从一些“小问题”可以看出来。
    “工厂工人得不到休息，应该减少会议”，这是从厂部检查同志来的一个意见。政治工作的同志研究确实如此。这次检查出来，很快就加以改变了。
      “要给工人休息的地方”，果然工厂拨出了一块有树木的空地，大家用义务劳动修成一个文化休息公园。
    厨房炊事员们也开始检查身体……。
    类似的情况很多，这说明，检查工作是一个巨大的推进力量。它给工厂紧张生活带来了清新的空气。
    斯大林同志在联共第十七次代表大会上说过：“组织得完善的审查执行情形的工作，好似探照灯一样，能帮助随时查明各个机关底工作状况，随时揭破官僚主义者与形式主义者。可以肯定说，我们的缺点与缺陷，十分之九都是由于缺乏组织得正确的审查执行情形的工作。毫无疑义，如果有这种组织得正确的审查执行情形的工作，那末缺点与缺陷是一定会事先防止了的。”
    什么是组织良好的检查呢？
    组织良好的检查必须有一个领导同志亲自动手，并由有经验的人参加的检查队伍。参加检查的人数量不必多，但应当尽可能是“内行”，他们十分熟悉工厂情况，一到工厂就可以投入生活中去。上级机关应当有一批有经验、得力的检查工作人员
  （不一定是专职）“控制在自己手内，用以检查实际工作的进行”（列宁）。这种有经验、得力的工作人员是可以培养的，办法有二： 一个是由原来担任过工厂一定的负责工作的同志担任；另一个是培养一些专门检查某一问题的人材。记得鞍山钢铁公司曾派了一位对工厂表报有研究的技术工作人员到机械厂专门检查研究表报，他不但查出毛病，而且帮助工厂研究了改进表格的方案，把原来的表报减掉三分之一，节省了工厂很多时间，这样的检查人员很受工厂同志欢迎。我们应当尽可能不派或少派毫无经验的干部去检查。领导机关应当帮助这些同志在内部熟悉一定的实际经验和业务知识，从政治上提高他们调查研究的能力。
    组织得好的检查，应当实行有计划有目的的检查，而不是走马看花式地“摸”问题。我们有些检查组到了工厂光熟悉情况就得花上半个月时间，这种瞎子摸象的办法收效不大，影响生产不小，因此，在检查前一定要进行充分准备，订出一个明确的检查计划。我看到的这些苏联同志，他们在检查一个工厂前，已先在领导机关内部对工厂的一切材料作了认真研究，他们不但知道工厂有什么问题，而且对于如何改进工厂工作也有了一定的意见，他们一到工厂就深入到生活中去找第一手的材料，并以这些材料为根据来作出检查结论。第一手材料的来源是每天大量的原始凭证，原始记录，实际生产和生活中大量存在的事实和自下而上的带有普遍意义的群众呼声。我们有些检查组只满足于一些转手的复制的材料，对工厂的一些总结报告和汇报材料不敢大胆怀疑，即便觉得对方说的不对头，也没有办法说服人家。我们要使检查工作有效，就必须严格依据这样的原则：“检查执行程度首先要在工作地点，根据工作执行的实际效果来分析判断，而不被那些报告左右了自己的独立判断力。”有些工厂对检查的人常有这样一个意见：“他们来了叫我们谈，叫我们写材料，临走时还把我们大批总结报告材料拿走，接着来了的人还是照旧要那些东西，真是没有办法”，如果我们根据工作执行的实际效果来进行独立的检查，那就会变成另外一种情况，工厂觉得检查组的材料比他们的好得多，他们就会要求检查组给工厂留下材料。
    组织得好的检查，这就要在检查中贯彻批评和自我批评的精神，毫不留情地揭露缺点并找出纠正缺点的方法。有些工厂干部同检查的人常发生这样的争论，工厂一些干部说：“检查人员只是从缺点看问题，有片面性。”检查人员认为：“我们如果从优点来看问题，这不也是片面性？”这两种人提法不对，结论却是对的。无论从缺点或是从优点去检查都会走到片面性的结论上去。我们的检查工作是检查执行程度，它必须是客观的，实事求是的和严格的。如果提出批评时老是这一类字句：“我觉得你这一方面作得还不够”，“似乎在这方面有着较为严重的缺点”，“基本上是执行了，但还有不少地方没有执行”，“大体上是好的，缺点也还不少”。这种批评都不能真正服人，甚至容易带有某种主观主义成分。检查的人应当让事实去说话，不是先扣上帽子，然后用事例去陪衬帽子，要抓住大量普遍事实，加以分析，形成一个颠仆不破的结论。检查得客观了，也就公正和严格了。我们有的检查组到先进工厂去检查时，自己思想上先有了一个“先进”的先入为主的观念，于是，在检查中处处害怕同这个“先进”的观念冲突起来，有时明明看到一些不对头的事，也觉得：“比起这个工厂的先进性来，这是些小事”，这样的检查是不客观的，因而也就作不到公正和严格，这种回避缺点的看法同舞弊徇私几乎是没有区别的，因为，对于检查人员来说，他必须从党和国家利益的立场来衡量一切，不管你是什么地方，什么样人，如果有了缺点或错误，那就不应掩饰而应揭露，不应宽容而应严查，否则就是对国家利益的漠不关心和不忠实，就会引导企业部门走向隐瞒缺点，夸大成绩的反党道路。所谓检查的严格性，这同检查人盛气凌人、令人望而生畏或是钦差大臣作风是根本不相同的。严格性的集中表现是坚持国家利益和维护国家的法律，不使国家利益受到一点点的损害。
    组织得良好的检查，对巩固一长制和提高生产管理的水平会起积极的作用。检查同志不是站在旁边指手划脚，而是把检查出的一切缺点按照不同性质进行分析，凡属于本企业内部可以改正的，都直接建议给厂长或党委会，如果厂长或党委会同意，就用命令或决议的形式立即执行，凡属于上级机关要解决的，就按问题轻重缓急提交上级解决。检查不是“算总账”，而是“清账”。它及时帮助工厂厂长及各级组织改正缺点。这样会不会妨碍一长制领导原则呢？不会的，因为凡是提交给厂长、车间主任的建议都是他们应该作而没有作到的，既然检查出来了，并且及时得到了纠正，这就减少了工作上的各种差错，因而也就巩固了领导威信和提高了管理水平。
    对一些主要工厂实行定期的全面检查会比零星的分散的检查收到的效果大，因为工厂活动是一个有机的整体，通过全面检查，上级机关可以全面了解工厂的活动，并从事物内在联系中发现工厂的主要问题，同时也可以解决次要问题。目前，我们不可能一下子有像苏联同志那样的熟练的检查能力，但，如果能把现有的对工厂个别检查的力量组织起来取得经验，这对工厂的帮助可能会大些，对生产的妨碍一定会少一些。
