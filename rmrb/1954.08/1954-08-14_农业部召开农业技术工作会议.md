The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened the National Agricultural Technology Work Conference from July 9th to 31st. During the conference, Deng Zihui, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Commission of the Central People's Government, gave important instructions on the relationship between agricultural science and technology and the socialist transformation of agriculture. Balyegin, Chief Advisor to the Central Ministry of Agriculture, and advisor Buniak provided many valuable opinions on the organizational work of agricultural science and technology institutions, the propagation of crop seeds, and more.

The conference summarized the development and achievements of agricultural science and technology work over the past four years. Currently, there are seven regional agricultural science research institutes or preparatory offices, two specialized research institutes, sixty-four provincial agricultural experiment stations (including provincial agricultural science research institutes), one thousand nine hundred and forty-eight special and county farms, seventy-seven specialized farms (or institutes), totaling two thousand and ninety-eight; three thousand nine hundred and forty-four agricultural technology extension stations, one thousand six hundred and eighty animal husbandry and veterinary stations, and five hundred and forty-three other specialized stations, totaling six thousand one hundred and sixty-seven. The above units have a total of more than one hundred and thirty-eight thousand employees (excluding cadres of professional research institutes), making them the largest force in the agricultural sector.

These science and technology institutions have played a certain role in the restoration and development of agricultural production in our country in recent years. For example, in terms of experimental research, technical cadres have undergone preliminary ideological transformation, studied Michurin's biological science, and their political awareness and professional level have generally improved. They have successively gone deep into the countryside to conduct investigations and research, and to summarize the experience of the masses, so that scientific research work and production practice have begun to combine. The summarization and popularization of Chen Yongkang's experience in high-yield rice, Qu Yaoli's experience in high-yield cotton, and Shi Anfu's experience in high-yield wheat have had an impact on the whole country. In addition, more significant research results include the breeding of the Bima No. 1 wheat variety, the research on pesticides such as 666 and serums and vaccines for major livestock diseases such as cattle plague, anthrax, and swine fever, as well as the successful experiments of wheat smut isolation method, peanut rhizobium inoculation method, Zazajun composting method, and high-temperature rapid composting method. In terms of farm work, more than 2,000 farms have been built in recent years, with more than one million mu of cultivated land, and a large number of improved varieties have been propagated. Taking the farms in Northeast China as an example, in 1953 alone, more than two million jin of improved spring wheat varieties were propagated. In the past year or two, provinces have successively carried out the rectification of farms, initially overcoming the supply system ideology, and the situation of farm losses has also begun to change. According to statistics from 1,276 farms across the country, those that are self-sufficient and have a surplus account for 59.6 percent, an increase of 32.8 percent compared with 1953. In terms of technology popularization, great achievements have been made in recent years in summarizing the experience of the masses, popularizing science and technology, and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, such as carrying out mass selection and variety exchange and popularizing improved varieties. According to incomplete statistics, the area of improved grain varieties nationwide has reached more than 260 million mu, and the area of improved cotton varieties is about 60 million mu. In addition, the promotion of new farm tools, advocating deep plowing and close planting, rational fertilization, rational irrigation, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests have significantly increased the yield per unit area. Taking cotton as an example, the national average yield per mu in 1949 was only 20.4 jin of lint cotton, but in 1953 it had increased to 30.8 jin. At the same time, the historical locust plague and cattle plague have been basically controlled or eradicated, thereby strengthening the guarantee of increased production.

The conference studied the specific tasks of developing agriculture in coordination with the development of industry during the period of national planned economic construction, as well as the new situation of the development of the agricultural production cooperative movement in various places, and unanimously agreed that it is necessary to strengthen agricultural science and technology work to meet the urgent needs in the process of socialist transformation of agriculture.

The conference proposed that in the field of agricultural scientific research, the establishment of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences should be started immediately, and preparations should be made to rationally plan agricultural areas nationwide according to natural conditions, gradually adjust the scope of work of existing agricultural science research institutes, and start preparations for agricultural and animal husbandry science research institutes or branch institutes in Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang. Each province should, with the help of the regional scientific research institute, rationally plan the province into three to five agricultural zones, and each zone can select a provincial, special, or county farm with good conditions and representative significance to establish an agricultural experiment station. It is estimated that about 100 to 140 agricultural zones can be divided nationwide. In this way, the regional and specialized agricultural science research institutes and the provincial agricultural experiment stations, under the leadership of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, will gradually form a strong agricultural scientific research network, which can promptly solve agricultural science and technology problems in various places.

The conference determined that the main tasks of specialized and county farms are to propagate improved varieties, demonstrate increased production, accumulate funds for the state, accumulate experience, and train cadres, requiring each farm to achieve self-sufficiency and strive for surplus. The main tasks of agricultural technology extension stations are to summarize and exchange the increased production experience of local people, popularize agricultural science and technology, teach the use of new farm tools, train peasant technical backbones, and provide guidance on accounting work for agricultural production cooperatives. To this end, in the future, it is necessary to actively and steadily carry out the construction of stations according to the needs of the development of the agricultural production cooperative movement and the conditions of the source of technical cadres, and gradually transition to future agricultural machine tractor stations with the development of agricultural collectivization and mechanization, and prepare cadres for future collective farms and tractor stations.

The conference finally pointed out that although the three links of experimental research, demonstration breeding, and technical popularization have different specific tasks, in fact, the three are an integral whole for the improvement of agricultural production technology, which are mutually related and inseparable. They must be organically linked under unified leadership and unified planning, and cooperate in division of labor, in order to complete the basic task of agricultural science and technology in improving overall production and promoting agricultural collectivization.

In order to ensure the completion of this task, party and government at all levels are required to strengthen their leadership over agricultural technology work. In agricultural departments above the provincial level, specialized management agencies should be set up; agricultural and forestry departments at the special and county levels should also have specialized management units or full-time cadres responsible for mastering them. All technical cadres should strengthen their political and professional studies, and take the initiative to rely on the local party and government leadership to do a good job in various technical tasks.

    农业部召开农业技术工作会议
    中央人民政府农业部，从七月九日至三十一日，召开了全国农业技术工作会议。会议期间，中共中央农村工作部部长、中央人民政府财政经济委员会副主任邓子恢，对农业科学技术工作与农业的社会主义改造的关系，作了重要的指示；中央农业部首席顾问巴列金、顾问布尼亚克对农业科学技术机构的组织工作，农作物种子的繁殖工作等，提供了很多宝贵的意见。
    会议总结了四年来农业科学技术工作的发展情况及其成绩。目前全国共有大区农业科学研究所或筹备处七处，专业研究所二处，省农业试验场（包括省农业科学研究所）六十四处，专、县农场一千九百四十八处，专业场（或所）七十七处，合计二千○九十八处；农业技术推广站三千九百四十四个，畜牧兽医站一千六百八十个，其他专业站五百四十三个，合计六千一百六十七个。以上各单位，共有职工十三万八千余人（专业研究所干部不在内），是农业部门最大的一支队伍。
    这些科学技术机构，几年来对我国农业生产的恢复与发展，起了一定的作用。如在试验研究方面，技术干部经过了初步的思想改造，学习了米丘林生物科学，政治认识与业务水平普遍获得提高，先后深入农村，进行调查研究，总结群众经验，使科学研究工作和生产实践开始结合起来，如陈永康的水稻、曲耀离的棉花、史安福的小麦等丰产经验的总结与推广，影响及于全国。此外在研究成果上较为显著的有碧蚂一号小麦良种的培育、六六六等农药和牛瘟炭疽猪瘟等主要牲畜疫病的血清和菌苗的研究，以及小麦腥黑穗病粪种隔离法、花生根瘤菌拌种法、扎扎菌制造堆肥法、高温速成沤肥法的试验成功等。在农场工作方面，几年来建设了两千多个场，已有一百多万亩耕地，繁殖了大量良种。仅以东北各场为例，一九五三年即繁殖春小麦良种二百余万斤。最近一两年来，各省先后进行了农场的整顿工作，初步克服了供给制思想，农场的赔钱局面，亦开始有了转变。据全国一千二百七十六个场的统计，自给和有余的可占百分之五十九点六，较一九五三年提高百分之三十二点八。在技术推广方面，几年来总结群众经验、推广科学技术、学习苏联先进经验等工作，都取得很大成绩，如开展群众性的选种换种和推广良种，据不完全统计，全国粮食良种面积已达二亿六千余万亩，棉花良种约六千余万亩，再加上推广新式农具、提倡深耕密植、合理施肥、合理灌溉、防治病虫等一系列的技术措施，显著地提高了单位面积的产量。如以棉花为例，一九四九年全国平均每亩仅产皮棉二十点四斤，
  一九五三年已增达三十点八斤。同时，历史性的蝗灾与牛瘟，均已基本控制或扑灭，从而加强了增产的保证。
    会议研究了在国家计划经济建设时期与发展工业同时相应地发展农业的具体任务，以及当前各地农业生产合作化运动发展的新情况，一致认为必须加强农业科学技术工作，以适应农业的社会主义改造过程中的迫切需要。
    会议提出，在农业科学研究工作方面，应立即着手筹设中国农业科学院，并准备按照自然条件，重新在全国范围内，合理规划农业区域，逐步调整现有农业科学研究所的工作范围，并应在内蒙古、西藏、新疆着手筹备农牧科学研究所或分所。各省应在各该区科学研究所的帮助下，合理规划全省为三至五个农业区，每区可选择一个条件好、代表性大的省、专或县农场，成立农业试验站，预计全国可划一百至一百四十个左右的农业区。这样，大区的与专业的农业科学研究所，及省的农业试验站，在中国农业科学院的领导下，逐渐形成一个强有力的农业科学研究网，就可以及时地解决各地农业科学技术方面的问题。
    会议确定专、县农场的主要任务为繁殖良种，增产示范，为国家积累资金，积累经验并培养干部，要求每场必须做到自给并争取盈余。农业技术推广站的主要任务是总结与交流当地群众的增产经验，推广农业科学技术，传授新式农具的使用方法，培养农民技术骨干并对农业生产合作社进行会计工作的辅导。为此，今后应根据农业生产合作化运动发展的需要，及技术干部的来源等条件，积极稳步地进行建站，随着农业合作化与机械化的发展，逐步过渡为将来的农业机器拖拉机站，并为将来的集体农庄与拖拉机站准备干部。
    会议最后指出，试验研究、示范繁殖和技术推广三个环节，在具体任务上虽然有所不同，但实际上三者是农业生产技术改进的一个整体，彼此互相关联不可分割，必须在统一领导和统一计划下，有机地联系起来，分工合作，才能完成农业科学技术对提高全面生产，促进农业合作化的基本任务。
    为了保证这一任务的完成，要求各级党政加强对农业技术工作的领导。在省以上的农业部门，应设置专管机构；专县两级农林部门，也应有专管单位或专职干部，负责掌握。所有技术干部，均应加强政治与业务的学习，并主动依靠当地党、政领导，做好各项技术工作。
