The Chinese Writers Association convened the National Conference on Literary Translation in Beijing from August 18th to 25th. A total of 102 literary translators from all over the country were invited to attend the meeting.

During the conference, Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, delivered a report entitled "Strive to Develop Literary Translation and Improve Translation Quality." Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles; Ye Shengtao, Member of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles; Ding Xilin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government; Zheng Zhenduo, Member of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles; and Lao She, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, attended and spoke on literary translation work. Li Shenzhi, Deputy Director of the International Department of Xinhua News Agency, gave a report on the international situation. Ge Baoquan gave a special speech on Soviet literary translation work, Zou Difan gave a special speech on cultural exchanges between our country and people's democratic countries, Jin Kemu and others gave special speeches on the general situation of literature in various countries. The meeting went through group discussions, and finally, Zhou Yang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, gave a concluding speech.

The conference pointed out the important significance of literary translation in developing China's new culture and promoting international cultural exchange. China's translation work has a long history and tradition. The translation of foreign literature has played a significant role and influence in the lives, thoughts, and literary and artistic development of our people. Today, as we begin to enter a great period of socialist construction, the task of literary translation is even more important. The planned introduction of advanced culture from all over the world, especially Soviet socialist culture, has become an inseparable and organic part of our socialist cultural construction.

The conference believes that literary translation work in recent decades has achieved great success, but it is undeniable that there are still many problems and shortcomings in translation work. The first is the unplanned and unorganized state of work. In order to put literary translation work on a planned path, national literary publishing organizations must consult with literary translators nationwide to formulate translation plans, and organize translation, revision, editing, and publishing in a step-by-step manner according to social and national needs and existing strengths, prioritizing tasks based on their importance and urgency. The conference discussed the "Draft Selection Plan for the Introduction of World Literary Classics" and will formulate a formal plan based on the results of this discussion.

Another major issue in today's literary translation work is the issue of improving translation quality. The conference believes that translating literary works must use clear and fluent translations to faithfully and accurately convey the content of the original work, and strive to convey the style of the original work in literary language, so that readers can be enlightened, moved, and experience beauty when reading the translation, just as when reading the original work.

Finally, the conference believes that in order to ensure the completion of the above two major tasks and do a good job in literary translation, it is necessary to organize forces to train talent. The Writers Association must strengthen its leadership over literary translation work, organize literary translators, conduct regular political and professional studies, and strengthen criticism and self-criticism. Publishing houses and magazine editorial departments should also widely connect with literary translators. Relevant departments should also take necessary measures to enable amateur translators to fully exert their strength and to cultivate new translation forces in a planned way.

    中国作家协会召开全国文学翻译工作会议
    中国作家协会从八月十八日到二十五日在北京召开了全国文学翻译工作会议。全国各地应邀出席会议的文学翻译工作者共一百零二人。
    会议期间，中国作家协会主席茅盾作了“为发展文学翻译事业和提高翻译质量而奋斗”的报告。中国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若、中国文学艺术界联合会全国委员会委员叶圣陶、中央人民政府文化部副部长丁西林、中国文学艺术界联合会主席团委员郑振铎、中国作家协会副主席老舍都出席，就文学翻译工作讲了话。新华通讯社国际部副主任李慎之作了国际形势的报告。戈宝权作了关于苏联文学翻译工作问题的专题发言，邹荻帆作了关于我国和人民民主国家的文化交流情况的专题发言，金克木等作了各国文学概况的专题发言，会议经过了分组讨论，最后，中国作家协会副主席周扬作了总结发言。
    会议指出了文学翻译工作在发展中国新文化和促进国际文化交流上的重要意义。我国翻译事业有悠久的历史和传统。外国文学的翻译对我国人民的生活、思想和文学艺术的发展起了重大的作用和影响。在今天我们开始进入伟大的社会主义建设时期，文学翻译工作的任务更加显得重要，有计划地介绍世界各国先进文化，特别是苏联社会主义的文化，已经成为我国社会主义文化建设工作中的一个不可分割的有机部分。
    会议认为，近几十年来的文学翻译工作是有很大成绩的，但是不可否认，翻译工作中还存在着不少的问题和缺点，首先是工作的无计划无组织状态。为了使文学翻译工作走上计划化的道路，必须由国家文学出版机关商同全国文学翻译工作者制订翻译计划，根据社会和国家需要及现有的力量，分别轻重缓急，有步骤地组织翻译、校订、编审和出版。会议讨论了“世界文学名著介绍选题计划草案”，并将根据这个讨论的结果订出正式的计划。
    今天文学翻译工作中的另一个主要问题是提高翻译质量的问题。会议认为，翻译文学作品，必须用明白畅达的译文，忠实正确地传达原作的内容，并力求用文学语言把原作的风格传达出来，使读者读了译文能像读原作一样的得到启发、感动和美的感受。
    最后，会议认为，为了保证完成上述两大任务，作好文学翻译工作，必须组织力量培养人材。作家协会必须加强对文学翻译工作的领导，把文学翻译工作者组织起来，进行经常的政治学习和业务学习，加强批评和自我批评。出版社和刊物编辑部也应该广泛地联系文学翻译工作者。有关部门还应该采取必要的措施，使业余的翻译工作者获得充分发挥力量的条件，并有计划地培养新的翻译力量。
