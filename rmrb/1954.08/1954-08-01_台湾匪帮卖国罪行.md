Taiwan Bandit Gang's Treasonous Crimes

      A Shameful "Milestone"
    According to a United Press International dispatch from Taipei on July 25, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang in Taiwan is currently requesting to sign a military treaty with the United States—a so-called "Bilateral Treaty of Common Security"—and also wants to include the coastal islands of our country that they occupy within the U.S. defense line. The Chiang bandit gang shamelessly said: This is another "milestone" in their history of cooperation with the United States!
    For the Chiang bandit gang's treasonous crimes, this is indeed another "milestone." On this "milestone" will be recorded: The Chiang bandit gang has sold out every blade of grass and tree on Taiwan, the territory of the Chinese people that they occupy!
      Enticing Overseas Chinese Youth
    According to news from Hong Kong, the Chiang bandit gang recently established a so-called "Overseas Chinese Student Scholarship and Assistance Committee," claiming to "help" overseas Chinese youth go to Taiwan for "further education," and is using so-called "poverty scholarships" as bait, planning to deceive overseas Chinese students into going to Taiwan.
    What will they do with them after deceiving them? According to recent news from Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek is forcing large numbers of young students to undergo military training, and some male and female students have already been transported to the Chiang bandit army on Jinmen Island to "serve." It is very obvious that the fate of the deceived overseas Chinese youth will not be any better. They will definitely be forced to undergo military training, and they will definitely be sent to the Chiang bandit army to "serve"—in a word, to be cannon fodder.
    Of course, the reason why the Chiang bandits do this is still inseparable from the instructions of their American masters. According to an "inside story" piece by American reactionary journalist Pearson published in the "Washington Post" on June 9, "Van Fleet admitted that Chiang Kai-shek's army is getting older and older and needs 'new blood.'" Van Fleet also put forward "a reserve plan" to supplement the Chiang bandit army, "training 20,000 young Taiwanese every four months." In order to collect aggressive cannon fodder for their American masters, the Chiang bandit gang has once again set its bloody sights on overseas Chinese youth!
        "Rice-Free Day"
    Because a large amount of American goods are pouring into Taiwan, the Chiang bandit gang's import surplus is constantly increasing, and the phenomenon of foreign exchange shortage is very serious. According to statistics, in October of last year alone, excluding "U.S. aid," the trade deficit of Taiwan bandits had already reached 8.61 million U.S. dollars. Under this circumstance, the Chiang bandit gang launched a movement, stipulating that one day a week should be a "rice-free day" for the people of Taiwan, forcing the people of Taiwan to go hungry, and using the rice to exchange for "U.S. aid" as capital for their treasonous conspiracy.
    Under the Chiang bandit gang's policy of betraying the country, the plight of the Taiwanese people can be imagined.

专栏：台湾匪帮卖国罪行

    台湾匪帮卖国罪行
      可耻的“里程碑”
    据合众社台北七月二十五日电讯报道：目前台湾蒋介石残余匪帮正在要求和美国签订一项军事条约——所谓“共同安全双边条约”，而且要把他们盘踞的我国沿海岛屿也划在美国防线以内。蒋匪帮毫不知耻地说：这是他们和美国合作史上的另一个“里程碑”！
    这对蒋匪帮的卖国罪行说来，的确是另一个“里程碑”。在这个“里程碑”上将记载着：蒋匪帮把他们所盘踞的中国人民的领土台湾的一草一木都出卖光了！
      诱骗华侨青年
    据香港消息，蒋匪帮最近成立了一个所谓“海外侨生奖助委员会”，说是要“帮助”华侨青年到台湾去“升学”，并且用所谓“清贫奖学金”作为引诱，打算把华侨学生骗到台湾去。
    骗去干什么呢？据最近台湾消息，蒋匪正在强迫大批青年学生进行军事训练，并且已有一部分男女学生被运到金门岛的蒋匪军队中“服务”了；十分明显，被骗去的华侨青年的命运绝不会更好些，一定会强迫他们受军训，也一定会把他们送到蒋匪军中“服务”，一句话，要他们当炮灰。
    当然，蒋匪所以这样做，照样离不开美国主子的指点，据六月九日的“华盛顿邮报”所载美国反动记者皮尔逊的一篇“内幕消息”透露说：“范佛里特承认蒋介石的军队愈来愈老了，需要‘新的血液’”，范佛里特并且提出了补充蒋匪军的“一个后备计划”，“每四个月训练两万名年轻的台湾人”。为了给美国主子搜罗侵略炮灰，蒋匪帮又把血腥的算盘打到华侨青年身上去了！
        “不吃米日”
    因为大量的美国货物涌进台湾，蒋匪帮的入超不断增加，而外汇缺乏的现象十分严重。据统计仅在去年十月一个月当中，不算“美援”，台匪对外贸易的入超就已经达到八百六十一万美元。在这种情况下，蒋匪帮曾发起了一个运动，规定台湾人民每星期有一天为“不吃米日”，让台湾人民饿着肚子，把大米去换取“美援”，作为他们进行卖国阴谋的资本。
    在蒋匪帮们这种卖国政策下面，台湾人民生活困苦的情形就可想而知了。
