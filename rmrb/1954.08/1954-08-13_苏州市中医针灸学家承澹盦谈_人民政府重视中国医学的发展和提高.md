Suzhou, Jiangsu Province TCM acupuncturist Cheng Dan'an, spoke excitedly to reporters about the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, saying: "The promulgation of the Draft Constitution is a great joyous event for the people of the whole country. Article 93 of the Draft Constitution, which stipulates that the state shall develop mass health services and gradually expand these facilities, is like a sedative for those of us who study medicine. At the same time, I also feel the weight of my responsibility." Cheng Dan'an has been engaged in the research of acupuncture therapy for twenty-six years. Before liberation, he traveled everywhere trying to set up acupuncture schools and hospitals, but due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' destruction of Chinese medicine, he was never able to do so. He said indignantly: In 1929, the Kuomintang reactionaries even proposed to ban Chinese medicine, but later, due to the protests of Chinese medicine practitioners across the country, it was not banned. Chinese medicine was subjected to various restrictions in the old society, and Chinese medicine practitioners were not allowed to use thermometers, stethoscopes, and other Western medical equipment. This reactionary behavior of the Kuomintang reactionary government, which attempted to eliminate Chinese medicine, affected the development and improvement of Chinese medicine. Cheng Dan'an then talked about the People's Government's emphasis on Chinese medicine after liberation. The People's Government's health departments are already conducting specialized research on acupuncture therapy, helping them to sort it out and improve it, and some hospitals are also applying acupuncture therapy. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government also held a symposium for Chinese medicine practitioners, soliciting their opinions on strengthening Chinese medicine work and encouraging them to promote our national cultural heritage and strive to protect the health of the people. At this meeting, a preparatory organization for the Jiangsu Provincial Chinese Medicine Academic Research Association was also established to help them study and improve. The Provincial People's Government has also decided to establish a Chinese medicine experimental hospital. All these measures of the People's Government have made Cheng Dan'an feel gratified. He said: "The ideal that I have not been able to realize for more than 20 years has now been realized. The joy in my heart is hard to describe. I must contribute my strength to the gradual expansion of mass health services stipulated in the Draft Constitution and to the health of the working people." (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏州市中医针灸学家承澹盦谈
    人民政府重视中国医学的发展和提高
    江苏省苏州市中医针灸学家承澹盦，谈起中华人民共和国宪法草案时兴奋地对记者说：“宪法草案的公布是全国人民的一件大喜事。宪法草案第九十三条中关于国家举办群众卫生事业，并且逐步扩大这些设施的规定，对我们研究医学的人来讲，像一剂定神药。同时，我也感到自己的责任的重大。”承澹盦从事针灸疗法的研究已有二十六年。在解放前，他到处奔走想办针灸学校和医院，但由于国民党反动派对中医的摧残，始终未能办成。他愤慨地说：一九二九年，国民党反动派竟提出要取缔中医，后来由于全国中医的抗议，才没有被取缔。中医在旧社会受到了种种限制，不许中医用体温表、听诊器及其它西医用的医疗器械。国民党反动政府这种企图消灭中医的反动行为，影响了中国医学的发展和提高。承澹盦接着谈到解放后人民政府对中医的重视，人民政府卫生部门已在对针灸疗法进行专门的研究，帮助他们整理、提高，有些医院也在应用针灸疗法。最近江苏省人民政府还召开了中医座谈会，征询他们对加强中医工作的意见，勉励他们发扬我国民族文化遗产，为保护人民健康而努力。在这次会上还成立了江苏省中医学术研究会的筹备组织，帮助他们学习和提高。省人民政府还决定举办中医实验医院。人民政府的这一切措施都使承澹盦感到欣慰。他说：“我二十多年来没有能够实现的理想，现在实现了。我内心的高兴是很难形容的。我一定要为宪法草案中所规定的逐步扩大群众卫生事业，为劳动人民的健康，贡献出我的力量。”　（新华社）
