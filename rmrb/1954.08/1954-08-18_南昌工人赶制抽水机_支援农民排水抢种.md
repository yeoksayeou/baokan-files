    Nanchang Workers Rush to Produce Water Pumps
    Supporting Farmers in Draining Water and Replanting
    Workers in various factories in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, are taking practical actions to rush to produce water pumps to support farmers in disaster areas in draining water and replanting late autumn crops. After the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory accepted the task of rushing to produce a batch of water pumps in late July, the workers demonstrated their initiative and creativity. Gong Lagen, an advanced producer and young planer in the Metalworking Workshop, was responsible for rushing to produce water pumps. In order to help farmers eliminate disasters as early as possible, he actively modified the gantry planer into a gantry milling machine, increasing work efficiency by more than two times. Gan Fusheng and Xiong Baoquan, workers and Communist Party members in the Molding Workshop, prepared all the tools needed by the team before going to work every day, so that the team could carry out production smoothly at work. Liao Quanshui, a worker in the Sheet Metal Section, created a record of cutting a water outlet pipe in two minutes, overfulfilling the plan by 400%. Jiangxi Textile Factory, Xinmin Textile Factory, Nanchang Power Plant, and Jiangxi Machinery Factory all promptly transferred technicians in casting, welding, and other trades urgently needed for rushing to produce water pumps to the Diesel Engine Factory to help with the work. With the efforts of all the workers, the factory completed the task of rushing to produce 180 water pumps one day ahead of the original plan of ten days. In early August, water pumps painted in light green and a large pile of black and shiny water pipes were transported to various water-stricken areas.

    支援农民排水抢种
    江西省南昌市各厂工人，以实际行动积极赶制抽水机支援水灾区农民排水抢种晚秋。南昌柴油机厂七月下旬接受上级赶制一批抽水机任务后，工人们发挥了积极创造精神。金工车间先进生产者、青年刨工龚腊根负责赶制水泵工作，他为了使农民兄弟提早排除灾害，积极地将龙门刨床改装成龙门铣床，提高工作效率两倍多。型铸车间工人、共产党员甘福生、熊保全每天上班以前就把全组需用的工具准备好，上班时全组很顺利的进行了生产。钣金工段工人廖泉水创造了两分钟剪制一只出水管的纪录，超额百分之四百完成了计划。江西纺织厂、新甡纺织厂、南昌电厂、江西机械厂都及时抽调了赶制抽水机急需的铸工和电焊等工种的技工来柴油机厂帮助工作。在全体工人努力下，全厂一百八十台水泵赶制任务，较原计划十天提前一天完成了。八月初，一部部漆着浅绿色的抽水机和一大堆乌黑发亮的水管子已运送各地水灾区。
