Strive to Save Electricity and Support National Industrial Construction
Yue Wo

In recent years, with the vigorous development of China's economic construction and the improvement of people's material and cultural life, electricity consumption has increased rapidly. Taking Tianjin as an example, the electricity sales in 1953 were 243 percent of those in 1949, and industrial electricity consumption increased by 323 percent. In some industrial areas, the electricity load is already quite strained. In the next few years, many new enterprises in China will be put into production one after another, and the population of industrial cities will continue to increase. The demand for electricity will inevitably continue to grow rapidly. In order to fully guarantee the electricity consumption for industrial production and promote the development of the national economy, China is currently actively building new thermal and hydroelectric power plants and power grids in various places to increase power generation. However, building new power generation equipment is not the only way to increase power generation capacity. The construction of power plants (especially hydropower) is technically very complex, takes a long time, and requires a large amount of national investment. For example, building a new 12,000 kW thermal power plant takes two and a half years and requires a national investment of more than 180 billion yuan. Another extremely important aspect of increasing power sources is to fully utilize the potential capacity of existing power supply and consumption, and to rationally save electricity in all aspects. This is a good way to solve the shortage of electricity supply. It does not require the state to spend a lot of money, and it is effective quickly if done well.

Since 1952, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry has regarded rational and economical use of electricity as an important task. Under the leadership and support of local party committees and financial and economic committees, and with the mutual cooperation and joint efforts of various industrial and mining enterprises and power departments, many regions have carried out this work and achieved considerable results. According to incomplete statistics, the country saved about 170 million kilowatt-hours of electricity last year, which is equivalent to adding 35,600 kilowatts of power generation equipment. This can supply electricity for producing 116 million bags of flour, or for producing 950,000 pieces of 20-count yarn, or for lighting a city of 400,000 people for 12 years. The electricity saved in the entire Northeast region accounted for 4.5 percent of the total industrial electricity consumption in Northeast China. The Shanghai paper industry saved 12 percent of electricity in three months. After the Luzhong Electric Power Bureau promoted rational and economical use of electricity in some enterprises, the unit power consumption was reduced by an average of 9.4 percent. These facts also show that the possibility of promoting economical use of electricity is entirely possible, and the amount of electricity that can be saved in electricity use is very large.

However, the breadth and depth of the work of saving electricity nationwide are still very insufficient. The main situation of power supply and consumption is: on the one hand, the power supply in most industrial areas is very tight, and the supply is less than the demand; on the other hand, there is still a great potential capacity in the power consumption units that has not been brought into play. On the one hand, there is not enough electricity; on the other hand, there are still serious phenomena of waste of electricity in factories and users. Some factories have large power equipment, but small electricity consumption, large motors driving small loads, and large transformers supplying a small amount of electricity for lighting. This creates an unreasonable phenomenon of low equipment utilization and waste of electricity. In Jinan City last year, an average of more than 40 percent of the transformers were connected in vain, and the motors were also 20 to 40 percent larger than the actual required amount, which wasted a lot of electricity. In terms of power consumption in production, the power consumption for producing the same product also varies greatly. For example, the electricity consumption per ton of electric furnace steel ingot is about 170 percent of the lowest, the electricity consumption per ton of solid caustic soda is 450 percent of the lowest, the electricity consumption per ton of newsprint is 250 percent of the lowest, the electricity consumption per bag of flour is 180 percent of the lowest, and the electricity consumption per piece of 20-count yarn is 170 percent of the lowest. According to preliminary calculations, if the electricity consumption in production can be reduced to a more reasonable level, more than 40,000 kilowatts of electricity can be saved. At present, the phenomenon of unreasonable use time of electricity load is still very common, which not only causes low equipment utilization rate, wastes electricity, increases power generation costs, but also affects the power safety of each factory. For example, the three line accidents that occurred in Beijing last year were all caused by excessive peak loads, which resulted in the shutdown of major factories for two or three hours, causing great losses. Many facts show that the actual potential power of electricity is very large. According to preliminary calculations by the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry at the end of last year, if all aspects of the national electricity system cooperate well, it is possible to tap more than 200,000 kilowatts of potential power from electricity equipment and electricity consumption. We must vigorously implement economical use of electricity and overcome the phenomenon of waste of electricity.

Economical use of electricity is one of the long-term tasks of factories and mining enterprises, and this work should be included in the production plan and made regular. However, many enterprises do not pay enough attention to this work, thinking that the electrical workshop is only an auxiliary workshop, and do not pay attention to it; some enterprises even regard the rational and economical use of electricity as an extra burden, emphasizing that production tasks are busy, and putting production in opposition to economical use of electricity. In fact, economical use of electricity is an important factor in improving production. It can promote the reduction of production costs, the increase of output, and the improvement of quality.

There are many methods for rational and economical use of electricity, and the scope involved is very wide. The main aspects are as follows: First, apply new technologies to improve production processes and production equipment. According to the actual experience of various places, rational and economical use of electricity is mutually promoted and closely related to production technology reform. For example, after Tangshan Decheng Flour Factory promoted the front-end flour extraction method, the unit power consumption was reduced by 21 percent, and the flour output increased by more than 30 percent. Secondly, make necessary adjustments to the equipment and strengthen the maintenance of the equipment, so as to fully utilize the capacity of each piece of equipment on the basis of safe power supply. In the past, due to our incomplete and unsound power consumption plans, the power equipment in some places was not installed according to actual needs, and many equipment were wasting electricity in vain.

Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and adjusting the power load is also an effective method for saving electricity. Under the leadership of the Municipal Finance Committee, the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, based on the power load situation in Beijing and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, carried out several power load adjustments. The one adjustment of the load, which was mainly aimed at factories and mines in the second half of last year, saved electricity equivalent to twice the electricity consumption of Tongxian City. In Tianjin, eleven units including the state-owned Tianjin First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Cotton Textile Factories and the First Branch of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant only staggered the workers' meal time with the peak time of the city's load in October last year, which reduced the peak load by 3,000 kilowatts. According to the experience of various places, the following methods can be adopted to adjust the power load: factories and mines that generally do not implement three-shift production should try to avoid lighting power consumption time and reduce peak loads; factories with three-shift production, except for equipment that must run continuously, should try not to start equipment that does not need to run continuously during peak load hours; industrial and mining enterprises in various regions should implement weekly seven-day rotation according to line distribution and load conditions, change the unbalanced power load on Sundays and other working days, and reduce the total power load; factories with one-shift and two-shift production can also stagger work and meal times to fill in low loads.

In addition to industrial and mining enterprises, government agencies, schools, organizations, and the general public should also save electricity. At present, there is a widespread phenomenon of serious waste of electricity in lighting in various places. The waste of these domestic electricity consumption is very alarming when concentrated. For example, if each 25-watt light bulb wastes one hour of electricity per day, it will waste 9 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. If calculated according to 184,000 25-watt light bulbs, it will waste more than 1,656,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. If this electricity is supplied to textile factories, it can be used to produce 8,280 pieces of yarn, or to weave 332,000 pieces of cloth. Beijing has achieved great success in saving lighting electricity. Many factories, government agencies, and schools have installed lampshades, polished light bulbs to give full play to the brightness, and pay attention to turning off the lights when leaving. Some units use desk lamps instead of chandeliers, and partially replace them with small light bulbs. Many stores have also appropriately reduced or adjusted their neon lights. From mid-March to the end of March this year, in the twenty days from 6 pm to 10 pm during peak load hours, a total of 800,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity was saved. The government agencies, schools, and residents of various places should learn from Beijing's approach, and try to save domestic electricity consumption as much as possible without hindering work, study, and daily life, and criticize all phenomena of waste of electricity, so that saving electricity becomes a mass daily activity, so that the country's industrial construction and industrial production can get more electricity supply.

In order to ensure that the work of saving electricity is carried out more effectively, the Central Financial and Economic Commission has stipulated this year that enterprises under the five central industrial departments should save 5 percent of electricity. This is an important task, and the relevant enterprise departments and electricity departments should conduct serious research and work together to complete this task.

    努力节约用电，支援国家工业建设
    越我
    近年来，随着我国经济建设事业的蓬勃发展和人民物质文化生活的提高，用电数量已迅速增长。以天津市为例，一九五三年的售电量为一九四九年的百分之二四三，工业用电增加了百分之三百二十三。有些工业区，电的负荷已相当紧张。今后几年，我国不少新建企业将要陆续投入生产，工业城市的人口还要继续增加，电力的需要量必然还会迅速增长。为了充分保证工业生产的用电，促进国家经济事业的发展，我国目前正在各地积极建设新的火力、水力发电厂和电力网，以增加发电量。但是，建设新的发电设备不是增长发电能力的唯一方法，发电厂的建设（特别是水力发电）在技术上很复杂，建设时间也很长，而且需要国家大量的投资。如新建一座一万二千瓩的火力发电厂，建设时间就需二年半，国家要投资一千八百亿元以上。增加电力来源还有一个极为重要的方面，这就是充分发挥现有供电和用电的潜在能力，并从各方面合理地节约用电。这是解决电力供应不足的一个良好方法，它既不要花国家许多资金，而且做好了见效很快。
    从一九五二年起，中央燃料工业部曾把合理和节约用电作为一项重要工作来进行，在各地党委和财政经济委员会的领导和支持，以及各工矿企业和电业部门的互相配合共同努力下，许多地区开展了这一工作，取得了不小的成绩。据不完全统计，去年全国节约电力约有一亿七千万度，这等于增加了三万五千六百瓩的发电设备，可供生产面粉一亿一千六百袋的用电，或生产二十支纱九十五万件的用电，或可供给四十万人口的城市十二年的照明用电。东北全区节约的电量就占东北全部工业用电量的百分之四点五；上海造纸工业在三个月时间中，就节约电力百分之十二；鲁中电业局在一些企业中推动合理与节约用电工作后，使单位电耗平均降低了百分之九点四。这些事实也说明了推行节约用电的可能性是完全存在的，电力使用中可以节约的数字是很大的。
    但是，目前节约用电的工作在全国范围内开展的广度与深度还是非常不够的。目前供用电的主要情况是：一方面多数工业地区电力供应已十分紧迫，供不应求；另一方面在用电单位还有很大潜在能力没有发挥出来。一方面电力不够用；另一方面各工厂和用户还存在着严重的浪费电力的现象。有些工厂动力设备大，用电量小，大电动机带小负荷，大变压器供给很少数量的电灯用电，这就造成设备利用率低电力浪费的不合理现象。济南市去年平均有百分之四十以上的变压器是空接的，电动机也较实际需要用量大百分之二十到四十，这样就浪费了许多电力。在生产用电的消耗方面，生产同一产品的耗电量也相差很大。如生产电炉钢锭每吨电耗量最高者为最低者的百分之一百七十左右，生产固体烧碱每吨的电耗最高者为最低者的百分之四五○，生产新闻纸每吨的电耗最高为最低的百分之二五○，生产面粉每袋的电耗量最高为最低的百分之一八○，生产二十支纱每件的电耗最高为最低的百分之一七○。据初步计算，如果把生产电耗量都能降低到比较合理的水平，就可以节约电力四万瓩以上。现在电力负荷使用时间不合理现象也还很普遍，这不仅造成设备利用率不高，浪费电力，增加了发电成本，而且也影响各厂用电安全。如北京市去年三次线路所发生的事故，都是因尖峰负荷过高，结果使各大厂停止生产二、三小时，造成很大损失。许多事实说明：电力的实际潜在力量很大。根据中央燃料工业部去年年底的初步计算，如全国各电业系统各方面配合得好，从电力设备和用电方面，可能挖出潜在电力二十万瓩以上。我们必须大力实行节约用电，克服浪费电力的现象。
    节约用电是厂矿企业长期性的任务之一，应当把这一工作列入生产计划，使之经常化。但现在不少企业对这个工作还不够重视，认为电气车间只是一个辅助车间，而未予注意；有的企业甚至把合理节约用电工作视为额外负担，强调生产任务忙，把生产与节约用电对立起来，实际上节约用电工作正是改进生产的一个重要因素，它可以促进企业生产成本的降低，产量的增加和质量的改进。
    合理和节约用电的方法很多，牵涉的面又很广，主要有以下几方面：首先是应用新的技术来改进生产过程和生产设备。根据各地实际经验，合理和节约用电工作与生产技术改革是相互推动，密切联系的。如唐山德成面粉厂推广了前路出粉法后，使单位电耗降低了百分之二十一，面粉产量增加了百分之三十以上。其次，对设备作必要的调整，加强设备的检修工作，在安全供电的基础上，充分发挥每一件设备的利用能力。过去由于我们的用电计划不周密和不健全，有些地方的用电设备不根据实际需要来安装，很多设备都在空耗电力。
    学习苏联先进经验，调整电力负荷，也是节约用电的有效方法。北京市电业局在市财委领导下，根据北京市的电力负荷情况，学习苏联先进经验，进行了数次调整电力负荷的工作，仅去年下半年以工厂矿山为主要对象所进行的一次调整负荷，它节约的电力，就相当于通县城用电量的两倍。天津市国营天津第一、四、五、六棉纺织厂和国营天津钢厂一分厂等十一个单位，在去年十月仅工人吃饭时间与全市负荷最高峰的时间错开，就压低了高峰负荷三千瓩电力。根据各地经验，调整电力负荷可采取以下几种办法：一般不实行三班生产的厂矿，应尽量避开照明用电时间，压低高峰负荷；三班制生产的工厂除必须连续运转的设备外，在高峰负荷时间内尽量不开动不须连续运转的设备；各地区工矿企业应根据线路分布及负荷情况，分组实行星期七日轮休，改变星期天与其他工作日电力负荷不均衡状况，降低总的电力负荷；一班和二班制生产的工厂，也可交错上下班和用膳时间，以填平低负荷。
    除了工矿企业以外，机关学校团体和一般居民群众也应当节约用电。目前各地在照明用电方面，普遍存在着严重的浪费现象。这些生活用电的浪费，集中起来是很惊人的。如按每盏二十五瓦的电灯每天浪费一小时的电力计算，一年就要浪费九度电，如按十八万四千盏二十五瓦的电灯计算，一年就要浪费一百六十五万六千多度电，而用这些电力供给纺织厂，就可用以生产八千二百八十件纱，或用以织三十三万二千匹布。在节约照明用电方面，北京市已获得很大成绩，很多工厂、机关、学校都加装灯罩，擦亮灯泡，使光度充分发挥，并注意随手关灯；有的单位用台灯时不用吊灯，并局部改用小灯泡；很多商店的霓虹灯也适当加以减少或调整：仅从今年三月中旬到三月底二十天时间中，在每天下午六点到十点的高峰负荷时间内，共节约了八十万度电。各地的机关、学校和居民们，应当学习北京的这种做法，在不妨碍工作学习及日常生活的原则下，尽量节约生活用电，并对一切浪费电力的现象展开批评，使节约用电成为群众性的日常活动，就可让国家的工业建设和工业生产得到更多的电力供应。
    为了使节约用电工作的进行更有保证，今年中央财政经济委员会已规定中央五个工业部门所属企业要节约用电百分之五。这是一个重要的任务，有关企业部门和电业部门应当加以认真的研究，共同来完成这个任务。
