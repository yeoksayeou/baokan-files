Xinhua News Agency: Beijing—The internship work for graduating students of national higher industrial schools concluded by the end of July, and the production internships for students of other grades will also be completed by the end of August and the beginning of September. In order to do a good job in the final stages of production internships in higher industrial schools, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government has issued a "Notice on Higher Industrial Schools Doing a Good Job in Summarizing Production Internships." The notice points out: Last year's production internship achieved great results. Most schools carried out the summary work in a timely and serious manner, providing a lot of experience for this year's production internship. However, a few schools did the summary work in a relatively perfunctory manner, the gains were not further consolidated, the experience was not well summarized, and the problems and shortcomings were not seriously analyzed and researched, and no measures for improvement were proposed. This year's production internship task is very arduous, especially the first time to carry out professional production internships nationwide, and many new problems and difficulties have emerged. In order to strive to ensure the quality of production internships, accumulate experience in a timely manner, and lay the foundation for next year's internship work, in addition to strengthening the guidance and inspection of internships during the internship process, paying attention to research issues, cultivating typical examples, and summarizing and exchanging experience in a timely manner, all schools should also seize the final work at the end of the internship, especially for the main gains and guidance methods in this year's professional production internship. The spirit of criticism and self-criticism should be fully utilized to conduct serious research and summary.

The notice stipulates the summary content: an overview of the internship, the main gains of the internship, the guidance methods of the internship, political work, and the analysis of the main problems and shortcomings existing in the internship, and suggestions for improvement, opinions and suggestions to relevant leading departments. It requires each school to formulate a summary outline in combination with the specific situation, focusing on the main and outstanding experiences and problems in the internship, and to make concise and focused summary reports and typical special summary reports for the entire school.

    中央人民政府高等教育部发出通知
    要求作好高等工业学校生产实习总结工作
    全国高等工业学校应届毕业生的实习工作已在七月底以前结束，其他各年级学生的生产实习也将在八月底和九月初实习完毕。中央人民政府高等教育部为了作好高等工业学校生产实习的结束工作，已发出“关于高等工业学校作好生产实习总结工作的通知”。通知指出：去年的生产实习获得了很大的成绩，多数学校都及时认真地进行了总结工作，为今年的生产实习提供了不少经验。但也有少数学校总结工作做得较草率，收获没有进一步巩固，经验没有很好地总结，存在的问题和缺点也没有认真地进行分析研究，提出改进的办法。今年生产实习的任务很艰巨，特别是在全国范围内第一次进行专业生产实习，出现了不少新问题、新困难。为了努力保证生产实习的质量，及时累积经验，为明年的实习工作打下基础，各学校除了在实习进程中应加强实习的指导和检查，注意研究问题，培养典型，及时总结交流经验外，在实习完毕时，即应抓紧结束工作，特别对今年专业生产实习中的主要收获和指导方法问题，应充分发挥批评与自我批评的精神，认真进行研究和总结。
    通知规定总结内容：实习概况、实习的主要收获、实习的指导方法、政治工作和实习中存在的主要问题、缺点的分析及改进意见，对有关领导部门的意见及建议，要求各校结合具体情况，拟订总结提纲，着重实习中主要的、突出的经验和问题，简明扼要地、有重点地作出全校性的总结报告和典型的专题总结报告。（新华社）
