Xinhua News Agency, 13th: At the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council meeting in Beijing on the morning of the 13th, representatives from various countries delivered speeches on the first and second agenda items.

Those who spoke on the first agenda item included: Abdullah Obeid, representative of British Sudan; Alfredo Das, representative of Portugal; Bengt Andersson, observer from Sweden; Chen Heguo, representative of Malaya; and Baharudin, representative of Indonesia. Speaking on the second agenda item were: representatives from Italy, Trani, representative of Iran; Lauri Suranta, representative of Finland; Maximo Leon Gaza, representative of Mexico; Antonín Fuchnar, representative of Czechoslovakia; Shigeo Suzuki, observer from Japan; Sadaoui Rachid, representative of Algeria; Walter Wachs, representative of Austria; Batista Moreira, representative of Brazil, and others.

They unanimously endorsed the reports by Bernini and Denis. During the discussion of the second agenda item, representatives from various countries also offered many specific suggestions to the meeting based on their respective national situations. They all expressed their active support for and participation in the convening of the International Rural Youth Conference.

Chen Heguo, the representative from Malaya, after presenting the conference with a flag and a package of photographs documenting the heroic struggle of Malayan youth on behalf of the youth of Malaya, went on to say that the war of resistance by our people and youth against the armed attacks of the colonialists has now entered its seventh year, which proves that the strength of our people is constantly growing.

He solemnly stated that the Malayan liberation movement has repeatedly and officially announced that if the fundamental rights of the Malayan people to national independence and self-determination are not violated, they are willing to conduct peaceful negotiations to end the war in Malaya. Our youth actively support this peace proposal. However, the colonialists have ignored this proposal. Nevertheless, our youth's struggle for national independence must continue and be strengthened until we achieve victory. Our youth will always support a peaceful resolution to the Malayan war. Youth and peace-loving people around the world should unite to promote the realization of this solution.

He then introduced other aspects of the Malayan youth's struggle for peace, national independence, and youth rights. His speech was warmly welcomed.

When Chen Heguo finished speaking, young men and women from the British delegation enthusiastically came forward to present flowers to the Malayan youth delegation. The Malayan representative immediately reciprocated by presenting the British representative with a yellow silk banner embroidered during their journey. The youth from both countries then tightly embraced each other in this deep friendship, shaking hands and kissing. The entire venue immediately erupted in cheers for this friendly and moving scene.

Shortly thereafter, when the Indonesian representative finished speaking, the Dutch representative also went up to present him with flowers. The venue once again resounded with warm applause.

In a friendly, harmonious, and enthusiastic atmosphere, the general discussion on the first agenda item successfully concluded at 10:30 this morning.

Following this, the Executive Chairman read out a congratulatory message from Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee: "Youth are the main force in defending world peace and the driving force behind promoting human culture. I hope you will unite the youth forces of the world to strive to ease international tensions and improve the level of human happiness."

The entire venue erupted in thunderous applause, expressing gratitude for the congratulatory message.

Subsequently, the meeting moved on to the discussion of the second agenda item.

The meeting listened with great interest to the speech by the Italian representative, the country that initiated the International Rural Youth Conference. He first endorsed Jacques Denis's report, and then he expressed his gratitude to the World Federation of Democratic Youth for approving and adopting the Italian youth's initiative to hold the International Rural Youth Conference, and for inviting all member organizations to work for the success of this conference. He said, let us move forward with the vast rural youth, for unity and happiness! And he firmly declared: "Let us move forward consciously and confidently, the sower of wheat will surely defeat the sower of death and war!"

During the meeting, thirty young men and women, representing workers from eight light and heavy industrial factories in Beijing and postal workers, as well as representatives from Beijing's famous state-owned farms, collective farms, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and many rural peasants, presented the conference with industrial and agricultural gifts produced by them, expressing the capital's youth's high respect for the meeting.

The entire venue stood up and applauded for three minutes, warmly thanking the gift.

    发言代表中的马来亚代表陈和国，在代表马来亚青年向大会献上一面旗子和一包记录马来亚青年英勇斗争的照片后，接着说，我国人民和青年对殖民者的武装袭击进行反抗的战争现在已经进入了第七个年头，这就证明我们的人民力量在不断地增长着。
    他又郑重说明马来亚解放运动者曾屡次正式宣布：如果马来亚人民民族独立和自决的基本权利不受破坏，他们愿意进行和平谈判来结束马来亚的战争。我国青年积极地支持这项和平建议。但是殖民者对这项建议却置之不理。虽然如此，我国青年争取民族独立的斗争仍要继续并且加强，直到我们取得胜利为止。我国青年将永远拥护和平解决马来亚战争。全世界青年及爱好和平的人民应该团结起来促进这种解决的实现。
    接着，他又介绍了马来亚青年为和平、民族独立和青年权利而斗争的其他方面的工作。他的发言受到热烈欢迎。
    当陈和国结束发言时，英国代表团男女青年热情地上前向马来亚青年代表团赠献鲜花。马来亚代表当即把一面在旅途中绣制的黄色锦旗回赠英国代表。两国的青年便在这深切的友爱中紧紧地拥抱在
  一起，握手和接吻。全场立即为这一友好动人的情景而欢腾起来。
    不久以后，在印尼代表发言结束时，荷兰代表也上去向他献花。会场又一次响起热烈掌声。

    全场响起暴风雨般的掌声，对贺词表示感谢。
    随后，会议即转入关于第二项议程的讨论。
    会议以极大的兴趣听取了召开国际农村青年大会的倡议国意大利代表发言。他首先拥护雅克·德尼的报告，接着他对世界民主青联赞成和采纳了意大利青年关于举行国际农村青年大会的倡议，并邀请了所有的会员组织为这次大会的成功而工作表示感谢。他说，让我们和广大农村青年一起，为团结、幸福而向前迈进！他并坚定有力地宣称：“让我们自觉地、满怀信心地前进吧，散播麦种的人是一定能够战胜散播死亡和战争的人的！”
    会间，代表北京市八个轻重工业工厂工人和邮递工人以及代表北京市各著名的国营农场、集体农庄、农业生产合作社及很多农村农民的三十位男女青年，把他们生产的工农业礼品献给大会，表示首都青年对会议的崇高敬意。
