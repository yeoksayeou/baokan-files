Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: Thousands of people in Bremen Port, West Germany, clashed with Bonn police and American military police during demonstrations protesting the American occupation forces' seizure of land and demolition of houses.

The incident was triggered by the American occupation authorities' rejection of residents' requests to postpone the demolition of houses. In early July, the U.S. military authorities proposed allocating 30 million marks from occupation fees to build houses in the suburbs of Bremen Port for the use of American occupation officers and their families. This plan required the demolition of more than 100 houses and the seizure of large areas of farmland. Residents of Bremen Port repeatedly requested postponement of the demolition of their houses, but the American occupation authorities refused to accept these requests. The American High Commissioner to Germany, Conant, shamelessly said: This is a way to solve the housing shortage in West Germany.

In desperation, thousands of residents of Bremen Port took up wooden sticks and pitchforks on August 5 to prevent the American occupation forces from demolishing their houses. However, the residents' actions to defend their homes were suppressed by Bonn police and American military police. Many people were seriously injured on the spot, and many others were arrested by American military police. Dockworkers in Bremen Port and workers from nearby factories were extremely angry when they heard the news, and immediately put down their tools to come to support. Under the angry counterattack of workers and residents, the Bonn police and American military police were forced to retreat. Subsequently, the demonstrators sent representatives to the city government to petition, demanding punishment of the police who committed the violence, cessation of the demolition of houses, and release of the arrested men and women residents.

Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: TASS Berlin, August 8th: The struggle of the residents of Bremen Port, West Germany, against the American occupation forces and to defend their homes is still ongoing. As of August 8, no matter how the police carried out armed persecution, the municipal authorities still had not been able to drive away a single resident. The heroic struggle of the residents of Bremen Port has gained the support of people from all over Germany. They have received many telegrams and letters from all over Germany.

The Secretariat of the Democratic Women's League of Germany said in a letter to the residents of Bremen Port: Millions of women in the German Democratic Republic support the patriotic actions of the workers of Bremen Port.

On August 7, the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany broadcast a letter to the residents of Bremen Port through the radio. The letter said: The people of all Germany are watching your tenacious and heroic resistance. Your struggle to defend your rights has set an example for the people of all Germany. Germany belongs to the German people. Our vital issues must be decided by ourselves!

    西德不来梅港居民坚持反对美国占领军的斗争
    德国各地人民表示支持不来梅居民的反抗
    【新华社柏林讯】西德不来梅港数千群众在抗议美国占领军强占土地和拆毁民房的示威中和波恩警察及美国宪兵发生冲突。
    这次事件是由于美国占领当局拒绝居民要求延缓拆毁民房的要求而引起的。美军当局于七月初就提出从占领费中拨款三千万马克在不来梅港近郊建筑房屋供给美国占领军官及其家属占用。这一计划需要拆毁一百多幢民房和强占大片农田。不来梅港的居民纷纷要求延缓拆毁他们的房屋，但美国占领当局拒不接受这些要求。美国驻德高级专员康南特反而恬不知耻地说：这是解决西德房荒的办法。
    在无可奈何的情况下，不来梅港的数千居民于八月五日拿起木棍和干草叉来阻止美国占领军拆毁他们的房屋。然而，居民们保卫他们家园的行动却受到波恩警察和美国宪兵的镇压，当场有许多人受重伤，还有许多人被美国宪兵逮捕。不来梅港的码头工人和港口附近工厂的工人听到这个消息后极为愤怒，立刻放下工具前来支援。波恩警察和美国宪兵在工人和居民愤怒的反击下，被迫撤退。随后，示威群众派遣代表到市政府请愿，要求惩办行凶警察、停止拆毁民房和释放被捕的男女居民。
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社柏林八日讯：西德不来梅港居民反对美国占领军、保卫家园的斗争仍在坚持中。到八月八日为止，不管警察如何进行武力迫害，市政当局仍然没有能够赶走一家居民。不来梅港居民的英勇斗争获得了德国各地人民的声援。他们接到许多从全德各地发来的电报和信件。
    德国民主妇女联合会书记处在给不来梅港居民的信中说：德意志民主共和国的千百万妇女支持不来梅港工人的爱国行动。
    八月七日，民主德国全国阵线全国委员会通过电台广播了致不来梅港居民的信。信中说：全德国的人民都在注视着你们的顽强英勇的反抗。你们保卫自己的权利的斗争为全德国人民树立了一个榜样。德国是属于德国人民的。我们的切身问题必须由我们自己来决定！
