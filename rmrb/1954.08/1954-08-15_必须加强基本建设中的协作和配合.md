    Must Strengthen Collaboration and Coordination in Basic Construction
    Qian Sichao
    The large-scale basic construction projects currently underway in our country are an important lever for increasing our country's industrial and agricultural productivity, expanding the proportion of the socialist industrial economy, and realizing socialist industrialization. The 141 major construction projects to be built within our country's first Five-Year Plan are the backbone of industrial construction. The completion of these major construction projects will ensure the growth rate of our country's industrial production and the increase in the proportion of socialist industry, and will bring about major changes in the face of our entire national economy.
    In the past two years, especially in the last six months, we have fully experienced the complexity and arduousness of industrial construction in the selection of factory sites for these major construction projects, the layout of industrial areas, and other construction preparation work. In basic construction, especially industrial construction, there are extremely complex and extensive connections not only between various construction projects, between new enterprises and existing enterprises, and between various industrial departments, but also between industrial departments and other national economic departments. If these many interrelated problems are not resolved well, it will not only delay the design and construction progress of new enterprises, but also create long-term economic irrationality after the new enterprises start production in the future. Therefore, to make the construction of industrial enterprises economically reasonable and to improve the speed of industrial construction, we must pay attention to the connections in all aspects of basic construction and solve the various problems that require mutual cooperation and coordination in specific construction work.
    The cooperation and coordination in basic construction work primarily involve how new enterprises and existing enterprises can ensure production collaboration and product balance. This is a very important issue in the integrity of industrial construction. A large proportion of new enterprises and existing enterprises have a relationship of mutual supply of finished products, semi-finished products, or by-products. Some enterprises (such as the automobile industry) even need hundreds of enterprises to supply parts, components, and materials. All industrial departments, whether between the iron and steel industry and the machinery industry, between the mining industry and the smelting industry, between the chemical industry, between heavy industry and light industry, etc., have extremely complex technical and economic connections in production. At the same time, when considering production collaboration and product balance, it is necessary to proceed from regional balance as much as possible. Some enterprises, due to different products (such as the chemical industry), are not convenient for long-distance transportation and must be balanced as much as possible within the industrial zone or within a certain distance. In addition to considering regional balance as much as possible for some products, it is also necessary to consider balance with other industrial zones. Therefore, when selecting the factory site for new enterprises and arranging industrial zones, it is necessary to consider the production collaboration within the industrial zone and the regional distribution of industrial enterprises based on the nature of the enterprise, the source of raw materials, and the consumption area of the product, and consider the principles of regional specialization and comprehensive development, so that production is as close as possible to raw materials, fuel, and consumption areas to avoid long-distance transportation and opposite transportation. These issues must be carefully studied before they can be determined at the stage of compiling the design task book for new enterprises. At the same time, according to the time when each enterprise in the industrial zone starts production, balance and agreement must be reached on production collaboration and the time, specifications, and quantity of finished products, semi-finished products, or by-products to be mutually supplied.
    Secondly, there is coordination and cooperation in terms of power supply, heat supply, and fuel. The electric power, coal, and petroleum industries are indispensable driving forces in modern industry and are pioneering industries in industrial construction. Due to our country's weak industrial base, the foundation of the power industry is also poor, and it is also unbalanced in regional distribution. Although some larger power stations and coal mines have been newly built in the past two or three years, they still cannot keep up with the needs of large-scale construction. Especially during the Five-Year Plan, we will start building many new major industrial enterprises in areas with backward original industrial bases. These enterprises require a large amount of electricity and coal, while the foundation of the power industry and coal mining industry in these areas is very weak. Therefore, the construction of these new industrial bases must first require the power department and the coal mining department to accelerate the establishment of new thermal power plants and coal mines to cooperate, so that new enterprises can be fully guaranteed power and fuel during construction and after they start production in the future.
    Thirdly, there is the coordination and cooperation between transportation construction and industrial construction. Transportation is the main artery of national economic activity, and industrial construction cannot move forward without the cooperation of transportation. All new enterprises need to transport a large amount of machinery and equipment and building materials during construction, and after they start production, they need to frequently transport a large amount of raw materials and finished products. If transportation construction cannot cooperate well with this, it will also affect the construction speed of new enterprises. Especially major factories and mines built in areas with backward transportation during the Five-Year Plan, such as steel plants, iron mines, non-ferrous metal mines, and coal mines, have large transportation volumes. In addition to the need for railway trunk lines to serve them, there must also be relatively long railway branch lines and dedicated lines to bear the large amount of raw materials and finished products. In addition, some enterprises also need to build dedicated roads, dedicated docks, and telecommunications lines. All these projects require the active cooperation and coordination of the transportation department to meet the needs of new enterprises in a timely manner, so that the construction of new enterprises can proceed smoothly.
    Fourthly, there is the coordination and cooperation between urban planning, urban public utility construction, and industrial construction. Due to the development of large-scale industrial construction, the construction of many new enterprises, and the emergence of new industrial zones, new cities and urban areas will inevitably appear, and the reconstruction of old cities will inevitably be caused. Therefore, on the one hand, each city needs to formulate an overall plan for each city based on the determination of the factory site of the new enterprise and the layout of the new industrial zone, rationally determine the scope of the industrial zone and residential area, and the construction standards for new residential areas and public cultural welfare, and collect and appraise the local engineering geology, hydrogeology, topography, wind direction, rainfall, temperature, water source and other basic data related to the construction of the industrial zone; on the other hand, it is necessary to cooperate with the construction of new enterprises and new industrial zones, make unified arrangements for public utilities such as water supply and drainage, public transportation (roads, bridges), cultural and welfare facilities, and carry out clear division of labor and cooperation with new enterprises and new industrial zones in design and construction work.
    The above four points are the main aspects of cooperation and coordination required in basic construction work. In particular, the design and construction of off-site projects such as water sources, sewage treatment plants, water and drainage pipes, transmission lines, heating pipelines, dedicated railways, telecommunications, and overall layout of residential areas for new enterprises and new industrial zones have become the most urgent problems to be solved in the construction of new industrial zones.
    However, due to our lack of experience in large-scale construction, especially the lack of experience in large industrial construction, in the past many industrial constructions, we have not fully understood the complexity of the interrelationships between the selection of factory sites for new enterprises, the layout of industrial zones, and the entire basic construction process, and we lack careful consideration. Therefore, many important tasks that require mutual cooperation and coordination in basic construction cannot be reflected and resolved in a timely manner. At the same time, in the past, there was a lack of necessary systems and specific organizational work in basic construction work to ensure mutual cooperation and coordination between departments and units; in addition, some comrades in certain departments lacked an overall concept, so many important problems that required mutual cooperation and coordination in basic construction could not be solved in a timely and reasonable manner, which could not but affect the construction progress of new enterprises and their economic rationality.
    In order to properly solve these problems, all construction departments must regard cooperation and coordination as an important work related to the success or failure of basic construction, understand the importance of the connection between industrial basic construction and all aspects ideologically, and the close relationship between cooperation and coordination in specific work. According to the national key construction guidelines and the principle of proportional development, take the initiative to study the problems existing in cooperation and coordination, quickly propose plans and measures, and actively take action. To this end, the leading departments of various economic constructions must first strengthen the organizational work in basic construction and specifically stipulate the problems that require cooperation and coordination between departments and between enterprises in the work plan. Secondly, it is necessary to actively promote the normal cooperation and coordination of various departments and units organizationally and institutionally. For problems that require mutual cooperation and coordination, a special contact system or working mechanism should be established for relevant departments and units. For example, all enterprises in each new industrial zone should establish a special office organization with the main enterprise unit in the industrial zone as the main body to solve various problems that require cooperation and coordination between new enterprises, make a clear division of labor for various cooperation and coordination projects between relevant departments, and determine the tasks that each department and each enterprise should undertake in the form of resolutions or contracts. What is particularly important is that, according to the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, cadres must be educated to fully understand the integrity of national economic construction ideologically, overcome departmentalism, partial viewpoints, "fear of trouble," "each sweeps the snow from his own door," and other incorrect thoughts and emotions, and promote the spirit of actively cooperating, coordinating, and serving key projects.
    With the development of large-scale economic construction, the division of labor in various economic departments will become more detailed, and the problems that require mutual cooperation and coordination will increase and become more complex. Only when various departments proceed from the interests of the country and from the interests of the whole, and establish a style of actively cooperating and coordinating, can the smooth completion of the national construction plan be guaranteed.

    必须加强基本建设中的协作和配合
    钱思潮
    我国正在进行着的规模巨大的基本建设工程，是提高我国工农业生产力、扩大社会主义工业经济比重及实现社会主义工业化的重要杠杆。我国第一个五年计划内要建设的一百四十一个重大工程项目，则是工业建设的骨干。完成这些重大建设项目，将保证我国工业生产发展速度与社会主义工业比重的增长，将使我国整个国民经济的面貌发生重大变化。
    最近两年来，特别是最近半年来，我们在这些重大建设项目的厂址选择、工业区布置以及在其他各项建设准备工作中，充分体验到工业建设的复杂与艰巨。在基本建设特别是工业建设中，不仅在各个建设项目相互之间，新建企业与原有企业之间，以及各个工业部门之间，有着极复杂极广泛的联系，而且在工业部门与其他国民经济部门之间也有着极复杂极广泛的联系。这许多相互联系的问题如果解决得不好，不仅会推迟新建企业设计与建设的进度，而且会造成新建企业将来开工生产后经济上长期的不合理。因之，要使工业企业建设做到经济上合理，要提高工业建设的速度，就必须重视基本建设各方面的联系，并在具体建设工作中解决需要相互配合与协作的各项问题。
    基本建设工作中的配合与协作，首先是新建企业相互之间、新建企业与现有企业之间如何保证生产上的协作与产品平衡。这是工业建设整体性中十分重要的问题。许多新建企业之间，以及新建企业与现有企业之间，极大部分都有相互供应成品、半成品或副产品的关系。有的企业（如汽车工业）甚至需要有成百个以上的企业来供给部件、零件、材料。所有工业部门，无论钢铁工业与机械工业之间、采掘工业与冶炼工业之间，化学工业相互之间、重工业与轻工业之间等等，在生产上都有着极其复杂的技术的与经济的联系。同时，在考虑生产协作与产品平衡时，必须尽可能从地区平衡出发，有的企业由于产品不同（如化学工业），不便于长距离运输，必须尽可能在工业区内部或在一定距离以内的地区加以平衡；有些产品除尽可能考虑地区平衡外，还必须考虑与其他工业区的平衡。因此，在选择新建企业的厂址与布置工业区时，必须根据企业的性质、原料来源与产品消费地考虑工业区内部的生产协作与工业企业的地区分布，考虑各地区专业化与综合发展的原则，使生产尽可能地接近原料、燃料和消费地区，以避免远程运输和相向运输。这些问题在新建企业编制设计计划任务书阶段，必须加以周密的研究后始能确定。同时，须根据工业区各个企业开始生产的期限，对生产上的协作，对相互供应成品、半成品或副产品的时间、规格、数量等取得平衡与协议。
    其次是供电、供热及燃料方面的配合与协作。电力、煤炭与石油工业是现代工业中不可缺少的原动力，是工业建设中的先行工业。由于我国工业基础薄弱，动力工业的基础也较差，而且在地区分布上也不平衡。两三年来虽然新建了一些较大的电站与煤矿，但仍赶不上大规模建设的需要。特别是在五年计划内我们要在原有工业基础落后的地区开始建设许多新的重大的工业企业，这些企业用电、用煤的数量都很大，而这些地区动力工业与煤矿工业的基础则很弱。因之，这些新的工业基地的建设，首先必须要电力部门与煤矿部门加速建立新的热电站与煤矿来配合，使新建企业在施工期间与将来开工生产后动力与燃料得到充分的保证。
    第三是交通运输建设与工业建设的配合与协作。交通运输是国民经济活动的大动脉，工业建设离开交通运输的配合是寸步难行的。所有新建企业在建设期间需要运送大量的机械设备与建筑材料，到开工生产后需要经常运送大量的原料与成品，在交通运输建设方面如果不能很好与之相配合，同样也将会影响新建企业建设的速度。特别是五年计划内在交通落后的地区开始建设的重大的工厂与矿山，如像钢铁厂、铁矿、有色金属矿、煤矿等企业，运输量都很大，除需有铁路干线为之服务外，还要有相当长的铁路支线与专用线，才能负担起大量的原料与成品的运输任务。此外，有些企业还需要建设专用公路，专用码头与电讯线路。所有这些工程都需要交通运输部门积极地配合与协作，及时地满足新建企业的需要，才能使新建企业的建设能够顺利进行。
    第四是城市规划，城市公用事业建设与工业建设的配合与协作。由于大规模工业建设的展开，由于许多新建企业的建设与新工业区的出现，必然会出现新的城市与市区，必然会引起旧城市的改建。因之，一方面需要各个城市根据新建企业厂址的确定与新建工业区的布置，拟定各个城市的总体规划，合理地确定工业区、住宅区的范围，以及新建住宅区与公共文化福利的建筑标准，收集与鉴定当地工程地质、水文地质、地形、风向、雨量、气温、水源等有关工业区建设的基础资料；另一方面需要配合新建企业，新建工业区的建设，对上下水道（给水排水），公共交通（道路、桥梁），文化福利设施等公用事业作统一的安排，并在设计与建设工作中与各新建企业新建工业区进行明确分工与配合。
    以上四点是基本建设工作中需要配合与协作的主要方面，特别是各新建企业新建工业区的水源地、污水处理场、上下水道、输电线路、供热管道、专用铁道、电讯以及住宅区总体布置等厂外工程的设计与施工，已成为目前新工业区建设中最急迫需要解决的问题。
    但是，由于我们缺乏大规模建设的经验，特别是缺乏大工业建设的经验，在以往许多建设工业中，对新建企业厂址选择、工业区布置及整个基本建设过程中各个方面相互联系的复杂性认识不足，缺乏周密考虑，因而对基本建设中许多重要的需要相互配合与协作的任务，不能及时地得到反映与解决。同时过去在基本建设工作中也缺乏必要的制度与具体的组织工作来保证各部门各单位相互的配合和协作；加之某些部门中某些同志整体观念不够，从而使得基本建设中许多需要相互配合与协作的重要问题，不能及时地合理地解决，这就不能不影响到新建企业的建设进度及其经济上的合理性。
    为了妥善地解决这些问题，各个建设部门必须把配合与协作当成关系基本建设成败的重要工作，从思想上认识工业基本建设与各方面联系的重要性，和在具体工作中配合与协作的密切性，根据国家重点建设的方针和按比例发展的原则，主动地研究配合与协作中存在的问题，迅速提出方案与措施，并积极地行动起来。为此，各个经济建设的领导部门，首先要加强基本建设中的组织工作，把各个部门之间，各个企业之间需要配合与协作的问题具体地规定在工作计划之内。其次，要从组织上制度上积极地推动各部门各单位正常地进行配合与协作，凡是需要相互配合与协作的问题，应建立有关部门有关单位的专门的联系制度或工作机构。如各新建工业区的各个企业，应以工业区主要企业单位为主，成立专门的办公机构，解决各新建企业间需要配合与协作的各项问题，把各项配合与协作的工程在各有关部门间作明确分工，并把各部门和各企业应担负的任务，以决议或合同的形式确定下来。尤其重要的是必须根据四中全会的精神，教育干部从思想上充分认识国民经济建设的整体性，克服本位主义、局部观点、“怕麻烦”、“各人自扫门前雪”等等不正确的思想和情绪，发扬主动配合协作、为重点工程服务的精神。
    随着大规模经济建设的展开，各经济部门的分工会更加细密，需要相互配合与协作的问题也日益增多和复杂，只有各部门从国家利益出发，从整体利益出发，树立主动地配合协作的作风，才能保证国家建设计划的顺利完成。
