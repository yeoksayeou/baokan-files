Wang Weifu, the torpedo boat captain, hero of the Toumenshan naval battle, and elected as a deputy to the National People's Congress, said: "In the past few years, we have been conducting resolute struggles for the liberation of our territory, Taiwan. We defeated the enemy in the Toumenshan naval battle. In the future, we will fight even more bravely and strive to eliminate more enemies." Li Yadong, a model worker from a certain unit on the Xiamen front lines, said: "We are at the forefront of coastal defense in Fujian and bear a particularly important task for the liberation of Taiwan. We must take active action and fight for the liberation of Taiwan, Kinmen, and other islands." Gu Zonglu, a mechanic from a certain air force unit, said: "We will not feel at ease until Taiwan is liberated. In order to liberate Taiwan as soon as possible, I guarantee to do a good job in inspection, ensure that the aircraft I am responsible for have no accidents, so that the aircraft can fly into the air at any time to strike the enemy." Lin Juncai, a pilot from a certain fighter jet unit who shot down a Chiang bandit plane in an air battle, said after reading the Joint Declaration: "In order to liberate Taiwan, I must better improve my flying skills. Regardless of day or night, wind or rain, as long as the superiors issue an order, I will resolutely take off and strike enemy aircraft." Liu Shanben, who was elected as a deputy to the National People's Congress, wrote an article. He wrote: "The Joint Declaration has added infinite combat power to us. We must work hard to strengthen training, improve political consciousness, and improve technology, and cooperate with the Army and Navy to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan."
