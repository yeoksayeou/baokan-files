    The summer harvest distribution work of the first batch of 258 agricultural production cooperatives established in Guangdong Province this spring has been completed. Except for a few cooperatives that suffered reduced production due to severe natural disasters, this batch of cooperatives generally saw an increase of more than 20% in early rice production compared to last year. This ensured a universal increase in the income of cooperative members. For example, among the 40 cooperative member households in the Ru Chuan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qiongshan County and the Chengmai County Agricultural Production Cooperative on Hainan Island, the least amount of increase in income was over 40%, and 12 households saw their incomes more than double. In the past, many cooperative members were worried about reduced income and had low production morale, and some even wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. Now, seeing the increase in income, they have all stabilized. For example, in the Liu Long Township First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chao'an County, 70% of the female cooperative members were worried about reduced income before the distribution, and the nine households with less labor power were even more concerned, even the cooperative cadres were apprehensive. However, the distribution results showed that the least increase in income was over 10%, which further increased their labor enthusiasm. In order to strive for a bumper late rice harvest, the cooperative originally planned to accumulate 100 boatloads of river mud before the summer plowing, but as a result, they exceeded the plan in just six days. The Ma Di Gang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanggang Township, Jiang County, saw an average increase of 369 jin of rice per household compared to last year. In order to strive for a bumper late rice harvest, the cooperative formulated a plan to strive for an increase of 16,000 jin of late rice immediately after the distribution.
    During the distribution process, the masses outside the cooperative were very concerned. In order to expand the influence of the cooperative, some publicized the distribution results to the masses after the distribution was completed; some held mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings or convened joint celebration meetings for mutual aid groups and individual farmers in the whole township, at which the cooperative reported on the cooperative's production and distribution results, and reported on the benefits of joining the cooperative based on the personal experiences of the cooperative members, which further encouraged the confidence of the masses outside the cooperative to take the road of collectivization. In Zhangjiabian Township, Zhongshan County, 50 mutual aid groups have joined forces to form 14 large groups in order to create conditions for transitioning to a cooperative.

Jiangxi Correspondent Station of this newspaper:

    The early rice harvest in Jiangxi Province has been successfully completed. This year, except for a few areas that suffered reduced production due to floods, the broad non-disaster areas generally saw increased production. The Gannan District and the Ji'an and Fuzhou Special Districts saw an increase of about 7%, and the non-disaster areas of the Shangrao Special District saw an increase of 10% compared to last year. The bumper early rice harvest this year was mainly due to the fact that organized farmers (accounting for 46.2% of the total number of farmers in the province) accepted advanced scientific experience, improved farming methods, and led the majority of farmers to carry out a series of agricultural technology reforms. Now, farmers in various places are beginning to harvest mid-season rice, sow late rice and autumn crops, and vigorously carry out processing and topdressing fertilizer in an effort to over fulfill the annual production increase plan.

### 广东省农业合作社早稻丰收社员收入增加  江西省广大非灾区早稻普遍增产

    广东省农业合作社早稻丰收社员收入增加
    江西省广大非灾区早稻普遍增产
    广东省今春建立的第一批二百五十八个农业生产合作社的夏收分配工作已结束。这一批社除个别社因遭受严重自然灾害而减产外，其他今年早稻普遍都比去年增产两成以上。因而保证了社员收入的普遍增加。如海南岛上的琼山县儒传村农业生产合作社和澄迈县农业生产合作社的四十户社员中，最少的也增加收入百分之四十以上，收入增加两倍以上的有十二户。过去有许多社员因为担心收入减少、而生产情绪不高，有的甚至闹退社，现在看到收入增加，都稳定下来了。如潮安县刘陇乡第一农业生产合作社，在分配前有百分之七十的妇女社员担心收入减少，九户劳动力较少的则顾虑更大，甚至连社干部也提心吊胆，而分配结果，增加收入最少的也在百分之十以上，因而更提高了劳动积极性。为了争取晚稻丰收，该社原计划在夏耕前积河泥一百船，而结果只六天就超额完成了计划。江县阳岗乡麻地岗农业生产合作社，每户平均收入比去年增加三百六十九斤稻谷，该社为了争取晚稻丰收，在分配后即订出争取晚稻增产一万六千斤的计划。
    在进行分配中，社外群众都非常关心。为了扩大社的影响，有的在分配结束后，把分配结果向群众公布；有的召开了互助合作代表会或召开全乡互助组和单干农民参加的庆祝增产联欢大会，在会上合作社报告了社的生产和分配结果，并以社员的亲身体会报告入社的好处，更鼓舞了社外群众走合作化道路的信心。中山县张家边乡有五十个互助组，为了创造转社条件，已经联成了十四个大组。

    江西省早稻收割已胜利结束。今年早稻除少数遭受水灾减产外，广大非灾区普遍增产。赣南区和吉安、抚州两专区都增产百分之七左右，上饶专区非灾区比去年增产百分之十。今年早稻丰收，主要是组织起来的农户（占全省总农户百分之四十六点二）接受了先进科学经验，改进了耕作方法，带动广大农民进行一系列的农业技术改革。现在各地农民正在开始收割中稻、播种晚稻与秋季作物，大力进行加工追肥，争取超额完成全年增产计划。
