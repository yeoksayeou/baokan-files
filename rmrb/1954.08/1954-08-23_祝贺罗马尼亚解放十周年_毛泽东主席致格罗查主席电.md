    Congratulations on the 10th Anniversary of Romania's Liberation
    Chairman Mao Zedong's Telegram to Chairman Groza

    To Comrade Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic:

    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Romania's liberation, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Romanian people and to you, on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China and in my own name.

    Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, the Romanian people have achieved brilliant successes in consolidating the people's democratic power and building socialism. These achievements have brought an increasingly prosperous and happy life to the Romanian people and have strengthened the world's forces of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese people sincerely wish the Romanian people even greater achievements in the cause of building socialism and safeguarding world peace.

    Mao Zedong, Beijing, August 21, 1954
