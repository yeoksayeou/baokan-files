    Instruction from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council Approving the Ministry of Labor's Decision on Further Strengthening Safety Technology Education
    The Central Ministry of Labor's report on the basic situation of safety technology education in factories, mines, and construction sites and the "Decision on Further Strengthening Safety Technology Education" are correct. It is hoped that the industrial departments in charge will supervise the factories, mines, and construction sites under their jurisdiction to implement them conscientiously. Local state-owned, joint state-private, and private enterprises should also implement them with reference to this.
              Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, August 11, 1954
