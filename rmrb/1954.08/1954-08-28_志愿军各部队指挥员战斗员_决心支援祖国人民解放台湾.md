Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 27th: The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army warmly support the joint declaration of all democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China for the liberation of Taiwan, and unanimously expressed their determination to support the people of the motherland and the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan with practical actions that vigilantly defend the victory of the Korean armistice and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The cadres and soldiers of the 5th Company of a certain unit, who were awarded special meritorious service in the summer counterattack last year, wrote a letter in the name of the entire company to the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops guarding the southeastern coast of the motherland after discussing the joint declaration, wishing them victory in the struggle to liberate Taiwan. Liu Ganquan, a second-class hero of a certain unit, said after reading the joint declaration: "I will work hard to complete all the tasks assigned to me by my superiors to support the struggle of the people of the motherland to liberate Taiwan!" Zhao Jihua, a second-class hero who participated in the National People's Delegation to comfort the People's Liberation Army, recalled the scene of the people on the southeastern coast of the motherland suffering from harassment by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit planes and warships when he visited the People's Liberation Army. He said excitedly: "If Taiwan is not liberated for a day, and if the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group is not eliminated for a day, the people on the southeastern coast of the motherland will not have peace for a day. I firmly support the joint declaration and am determined to support the people of the motherland and the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan with practical actions!" The Volunteer Army soldiers who are guarding the Jincheng area and Shangganling area on the northern edge of the demilitarized zone day and night are vigilantly monitoring the enemy's activities on the battle line with continuous rain, high mountains, and slippery roads. They said that we must guard our positions and monitor the enemy in front of us to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

The cadres and soldiers of Taiwanese origin in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army felt particularly excited after seeing the joint declaration. Huang Baolu, a cadre of Taiwanese origin in a certain unit, said: "I only left Taiwan after the Japanese invaders surrendered in 1945. When I was a child, Taiwan was still under the rule of Japanese imperialism, and my family often said to me: Don't forget that we are Chinese, we must return to the embrace of the motherland. The Taiwan compatriots are so eager for liberation! I will definitely work hard with all my strength to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating my hometown—Taiwan."

    决心支援祖国人民解放台湾
   【新华社平壤二十七日电】中国人民志愿军各部队指挥员、战斗员热烈拥护中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言，并一致表示要以警惕地保卫朝鲜停战的胜利、争取和平解决朝鲜问题的实际行动，来支持祖国人民和人民解放军解放台湾。
    在去年夏季反击战中荣立特等功的某部第五连的干部和战士在座谈了联合宣言后，以全连的名义写信给守卫在祖国东南沿海地区的中国人民解放军部队，预祝他们在解放台湾的斗争中取得胜利。某部二级英雄刘根全看了联合宣言后说：“我要努力完成上级交给我的一切任务，支援祖国人民解放台湾的斗争！”曾参加过全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团的二级英雄赵积华看了联合宣言后，回忆起在慰问解放军期间亲眼看到的祖国东南沿海人民遭受蒋匪飞机和军舰骚扰的情形，他激动地说：“台湾一天不解放，蒋介石卖国集团一天不消灭，祖国东南沿海的人民就一天不得安宁。我坚决拥护联合宣言，并决心用实际行动支持祖国人民和人民解放军解放台湾！”日夜守卫在非军事区北缘金城地区和上甘岭地区的志愿军战士们在霪雨连绵、山高路滑的战线上，百倍警惕地监视着敌人的活动。他们说，我们一定要守好阵地，监视住当面的敌人，支援解放军解放台湾。
    中国人民志愿军中台湾籍的干部和战士看到联合宣言后感到特别激动和兴奋。某部台湾籍干部黄保禄说：“一九四五年日寇投降后我才离开台湾。我小的时候，台湾还在日本帝国主义统治下，家里的人就常对我说：不要忘了我们是中国人，我们一定要回到祖国的怀抱。台湾同胞是多么渴望解放啊！我一定用全部力量努力工作，支援人民解放军解放我的家乡——台湾。”
