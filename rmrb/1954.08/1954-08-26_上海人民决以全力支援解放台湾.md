[Report from our newspaper] The six million people of Shanghai, situated on the front lines of coastal defense, warmly endorse the joint declaration by various democratic parties and people's organizations for the liberation of Taiwan. The vast numbers of workers, government employees, and citizens have expressed their determination to increase labor productivity, strengthen unity, and work diligently to support the liberation of Taiwan. After reading the joint declaration, the staff and workers of all departments and workshops of the Shanghai Wire Factory wrote pledges to fulfill production plans on big-character posters and posted them in the factory. On the 23rd, the Wang Yaozhang team of the bare wire workshop overfulfilled the bare copper wire production plan by 25 percent.

The workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company's power plant, who had suffered from bombings by U.S.-made Chiang bandit planes, expressed great anger at the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the protection of the American aggressors, for seizing Taiwan and enslaving Taiwanese compatriots. In mid-August, they wrote a letter to the first session of the first Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, which was in session at the time, expressing their firm determination to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. Worker Wu Guozhen, who had been arrested by the Kuomintang reactionaries along with martyr Wang Xiaohe before liberation, said: "If Taiwan is not liberated, our socialist construction will be threatened. The suffering of the Taiwanese compatriots is just like the persecution we suffered from the Chiang bandits before Shanghai's liberation. We must do our best to liberate Taiwan." The staff of the plant's operations department voluntarily proposed to ensure a safe power supply under any circumstances. All the staff and workers of the Shanghai Maritime Transport Bureau solemnly vowed: "We will resolutely serve as the PLA's rearguard, do a good job in transportation, and support the liberation of Taiwan."

At a meeting held by more than 800 staff and workers of the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau, Wang Yuqi, deputy secretary of the CPC Party Committee, gave a report on the liberation of Taiwan. He called on the staff and workers to fully launch a labor emulation campaign focusing on technological innovation, step up preparations, and contribute all their strength, together with the national maritime workers and the people of the whole country, to the liberation of Taiwan. The fishermen of Wusong Port, who had actively supported the People's Liberation Army in liberating the Zhoushan Islands, also went to the Wusong Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Police Sub-bureau to express their determination to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

Qiu Shuixiang, an overseas Chinese from Taiwan who had just returned from Japan last year, said with concern for his father and Taiwanese compatriots who are suffering in Taiwan: "The people of Taiwan are suffering even more than when the Japanese devils occupied it. Someone who returned from Taiwan said that last year, if a progressive element was discovered in a Taiwanese village, three residents would be killed. This year, if a progressive element is discovered in a village, all the residents of the village are in danger of being killed. Therefore, the desire of the Taiwanese compatriots for liberation is extremely urgent." Lin Zhong, Ye Qifa, He Yanbin and other returned overseas Chinese students studying at Shanghai Caoyang Middle School said after reading the joint declaration that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, entrenched in Taiwan, uses its reactionary organizations in various parts of the Nanyang Islands to deceive and sabotage the overseas Chinese, and lure and deceive young overseas Chinese to go to Taiwan to serve as cannon fodder. The overseas Chinese hate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to the bone. We must liberate our compatriots in Taiwan and let them live a happy life like us.

    上海人民决以全力支援解放台湾
   【本报讯】处在海防前线的上海市六百万人民，热烈拥护各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言。广大工人、机关工作人员、市民都表示要提高劳动生产率，加强团结，努力工作，为支援解放台湾而努力。上海电线厂各科室、各车间职工读了联合宣言以后，纷纷在大字报上写出保证完成生产计划的保证书，张贴在工厂里。二十三日裸线车间王耀章小组超额百分之二十五完成了裸铜线产量计划。
    曾经遭受美制蒋贼飞机轰炸的上海电力公司发电厂的工人们，对美国侵略者庇护下的蒋介石卖国集团窃踞台湾，奴役台湾同胞，表示极大愤怒。他们在八月中旬就写信给当时正在举行的上海市第一届人民代表大会第一次会议，表示坚决支援中国人民解放军解放台湾的决心。解放前曾和王孝和烈士一起被国民党反动派逮捕过的工人吴国桢说：“台湾不解放，我国社会主义建设就受到威胁。现在台湾同胞所受的苦难，正像上海解放前我们受到蒋匪的迫害一样，我们一定要为解放台湾而尽力。”该厂运转部职工自动提出：在任何情况下，保证安全供电。上海海运局全体职工庄严宣誓：“我们坚决作解放军的后盾，作好运输工作，支援解放台湾。”
    在上海海运管理局八百余名职工举行的集会上，中共党委副书记王玉琪向大家作了关于解放台湾的报告，他号召职工们全力展开以技术革新为内容的劳动竞赛，加紧准备，和全国海员工人、全国人民一起，为解放台湾而贡献一切力量。曾积极支援人民解放军解放舟山群岛的吴淞港口的渔民们，也纷纷前往上海市人民政府公安局水上分局吴淞派出所，表示支援人民解放军解放台湾的决心。
    去年刚从日本归国的台湾籍华侨邱水祥，怀着眷念正在台湾受苦的父亲和台湾同胞的心情说：“台湾人民比过去日本鬼子侵占时更痛苦了。有人从台湾回来说，去年，台湾村庄发现有一个进步分子，就有三个居民被杀。今年，如果在一个村庄发现一个进步分子，全村庄居民有同时遭到被杀的危险。因此，台湾同胞要求解放的愿望是万分迫切的。”正在上海曹杨中学学习的归国华侨学生林忠、叶启发、何炎斌等读了联合宣言后说，蒋介石卖国集团盘踞在台湾，通过他们在南洋群岛各地的反动组织，对侨胞进行欺骗、破坏，引诱和欺骗华侨青年到台湾去充当炮灰。华侨对蒋介石卖国集团恨之入骨。我们一定要把台湾的同胞解放出来，让他们和我们一样过幸福的生活。
