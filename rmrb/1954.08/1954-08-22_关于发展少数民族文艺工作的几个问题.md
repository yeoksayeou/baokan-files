Every person engaged in cultural and artistic work in minority areas can recount some personally experienced scenes: minority people surround the members of song and dance troupes or projection teams, embracing them and thanking them; people travel over mountains and ridges, bringing dry rations from hundreds of miles away to watch movies. "Chairman Mao has sent people to perform!" This event itself is warmth, is strength. People are more moved than anything else when they see their own ethnic children performing on stage. An Inner Mongolia film projection team went to a pastoral area, and the locals, seeing that all four team members were Mongolian, said with tears in their eyes, "We never thought that Mongolians could also use machines!"

These kinds of touching stories are endless. The cultural and artistic undertakings of ethnic minorities are developing year by year with the enthusiastic support of people of all ethnic groups. In the seven years since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the number of film projection teams and cinemas has increased sixfold compared to the time of liberation. From 1948 to the end of last year, the Inner Mongolia People's Publishing House published forty-one kinds of Mongolian literary and artistic books, and plans to publish thirty-five kinds this year alone. Xinjiang Province now has twelve professional and more than forty semi-professional artistic troupes, with more than 1,600 ethnic minority art cadres. From 1950 to 1953, Xinjiang Province screened nearly 400 films, allowing people who had never seen movies before to see them. The Xikang Film Education Work Team screened more than 400 performances in Tibetan autonomous regions and Liangshan Yi autonomous regions in two years. The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region's Yishan Prefecture alone has twenty-one cultural work teams, performing more than 300 shows in one month, with an audience of more than 400,000 people. Films, dramas, songs and dances, pictorials, slides, exhibitions... various forms of artistic and literary activities have become an indispensable part of the cultural life of all ethnic groups.

To further develop ethnic minority cultural and artistic work, I think we should pay attention to the following issues.

The development of ethnic minority cultural and artistic work cannot be separated from the unique artistic traditions of each ethnic group. All ethnic groups in the motherland have their own rich artistic heritage. Because all ethnic groups have long suffered from the oppression of imperialism, feudal forces, and the Kuomintang's Han chauvinism, and have been devastated in culture and art, exploring the artistic heritage from the people's oral traditions and musical instruments is a very arduous task. Xinjiang Province collected more than 1,000 folk songs in 1951, and more than 2,000 more in southern Xinjiang in half a year. The recording, notation, and collation of the "Twelve Mukam," known as the "Mother of Uyghur Music," is an extremely meaningful thing. Mongolian and Han literary and artistic workers in Inner Mongolia have done a lot of work in collecting Mongolian folk songs, folk tales, proverbs, and dance materials, and have published "Selected East Mongolian Folk Songs," "Climbing Songs Selection," the narrative poem "Gada Meilin," and Mongolian "Proverbs." Literary and artistic workers in Yunnan Province recorded and collated the beautiful Yi epic "Ashima." This work provides valuable material for literary and artistic workers in the region to learn from the national artistic heritage to develop new national art and literature, and makes this part of the heritage expand from some regions to become the common artistic wealth of the entire nation.

Songdai, a famous folk artist from Xilin Gol League in Inner Mongolia, told me: The oral literature widely circulated in Inner Mongolia includes lyric songs, odes, festive songs, duets, "Haolaibao," proverbs, riddles, etc., all of which have their own characteristics, but now there are not many people who can sing them. He said: "Some songs are only sung by people over fifty or sixty years old now." Judging from the materials Songdai mentioned, in Inner Mongolia, except for folk songs and proverbs, other types have not yet been organized. Even the organization of folk songs and proverbs is only the beginning. Our collection and organization work needs to be carried out in a more planned and led manner. First of all, there needs to be dedicated personnel and dedicated institutions. The Art Research Institute of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, which was established a year ago and absorbed folk artists to participate in the collection and research of Tibetan folk songs and dances, is entirely necessary.

The artistic heritage of all ethnic groups, like all our cultural heritage, has both its essence and its dross. Therefore, we should also follow the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new" when dealing with the artistic heritage of all ethnic groups, and cultivate different artistic flowers on the soil of different national artistic heritage according to the characteristics of each ethnic group. This is a very delicate task. We must resolutely abandon any subjective or crude approaches, and also oppose the vulgar "exoticism" mentality. When the Nationalities Cultural Troupe of the Central Institute for Nationalities worked in the Miao areas of Guizhou, they did not seriously study the characteristics of Miao songs and dances and the local actual situation, and deviated from the national song and dance forms loved by the Miao people. As a result, the performances were not liked by the Miao people. Later, in the Tibetan areas of Xikang, after solid understanding and learning, they reorganized the national dance "Harvest" on the original basis, and retained the original style in both music and dance, which was welcomed by the masses.

Taking root and developing on the basis of national artistic traditions does not reject or exclude the absorption of excellent things from other national cultures and arts. On the contrary, this is necessary for the development of new national culture and art. We must promote more cultural and artistic exchanges between ethnic groups. For cultural and artistic workers of ethnic minorities, learning the advanced culture and art of the Han nationality is extremely necessary for the development of the national art and literature.

National cultural and artistic troupes (song and dance troupes, drama troupes, film projection teams, cultural work teams, etc.) are powerful tools for the Party to spread spiritual food to the people of all ethnic groups. Therefore, national cultural and artistic troupes cannot be separated from the soil of the nation. The minimum requirement for these groups is to be based in ethnic areas, to breathe and live with the minority people, and to maintain close ties. In areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, this problem is not yet prominent, but "most of the ethnic minority art and literature groups in the Southwest region (except for Kangding and Changdu) remain in cities where the Han nationality accounts for the majority of the population, and most have not yet come into contact with the lives of brotherly ethnic peoples. Although the cultural work teams (teams) of the Southwest Institute for Nationalities and the Guizhou Institute for Nationalities have frequent contact with brotherly ethnic groups, they are mostly limited to the inside of the ethnic minority institutes, and the time spent living and learning in the brotherly ethnic regions is too short. Therefore, the understanding and excavation of the lives and national art and literature of brotherly ethnic groups is not deep enough." (Wu Xiaobang: "Experiences in the Art and Literature Work of Brotherly Nationalities in the Southwest," "Southwest Art and Literature," April 1954) Naturally, the ethnically mixed Southwest region is different from Inner Mongolia, which is so convenient, but if our art troupes are constantly floating on the surface, like flowers that have lost their nourishment, what future will there be other than gradually withering?

To enable cultural and artistic troupes in ethnic areas to take root in ethnic areas, the content and methods of cultural and artistic activities must adapt to the characteristics of ethnic areas. In terms of content, a large number of literary and artistic creations expressing the new lives of all ethnic groups are needed, especially popular literary and artistic works, and it is necessary to preserve and promote the splendid and colorful music and dance of all ethnic groups. In terms of activities and methods, it cannot simply be large-scale theater performances. For example, in the vast and sparsely populated Inner Mongolia region, people are not satisfied with the annual Nadam Fair's cultural and artistic activities, so it is necessary to focus on small, diverse, and decentralized activities. If there are small mobile organizations of six or seven people or even fewer, mainly singing and dancing, with slides, exhibition pictures, pictorials, etc., a large cart can go deep into pastoral areas and into yurts. Similarly, in the mountainous areas of the Southwest, where transportation is blocked, it is also necessary to break up into smaller units and perform separately. According to the experience of organizing cultural service teams in several leagues in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, this is practical and welcomed by the masses.

Our cultural and artistic troupes must also shoulder the task of promoting mass amateur artistic activities and carry out artistic and literary activities of all ethnic groups in factories, rural areas, pastoral areas, and schools. Under this close connection, professional ethnic art troupes will receive an endless stream of fresh nourishment.

The key to making culture and art in ethnic minority areas take root is to cultivate higher-level ethnic cultural and artistic cadres.

First of all, we must be very concerned about the growth of ethnic minority writers and artists. In recent years, some excellent literary and artistic works have emerged. These works have broken through the scope of simply describing the joy of emancipation in the early days of liberation in terms of content, depicting the new lives and new characters of all ethnic groups, and showing the path forward for all ethnic groups. In terms of form, they also use more national forms that are loved by the people of all ethnic groups. Most of these authors have lived in ethnic minority areas for a long time. They are familiar with the psychology and customs of their own ethnic groups. They have felt the new and progressive forces in the lives of the people in their own ethnic areas. Therefore, their works are more successful. We have also seen the emergence of a group of ethnic minority actors, singers, and painters who are welcomed by the masses. These are all gratifying phenomena. Cultural and artistic troupes in ethnic minority areas should regard constantly improving the creative ability and performing ability of ethnic writers and artists as their important responsibilities.

We should also encourage writers of all ethnic minorities to create in their own ethnic languages and give them the opportunity to publish. It is also extremely important to translate works of ethnic minorities into Chinese and introduce them to Han areas.

Secondly, we must gradually expand the membership of ethnic cadres in cultural and artistic departments and national art troupes in various regions. Ethnic minority cultural and artistic cadres are the link to carry out ethnic minority art and literature work. They can reflect the opinions and demands of their own ethnic groups and convey new things to their own ethnic groups. At present, the proportion of ethnic cadres in the cultural and artistic departments and ethnic art troupes in many regions is very small. In the Southwest Institute for Nationalities Cultural Work Team, there are only two Tibetans, two Yi, six Hui, and three Uyghur. Among the 70 members of the Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region Song and Dance Troupe, there are only five Tibetans. This situation is naturally unavoidable at the beginning and needs to be gradually improved. In the Inner Mongolia National Song and Dance Theater, 80% of the cadres are Mongolian. All members of the Xilin Gol League's Cultural Service Team are Mongolian. In Xinjiang, ethnic minority art cadres also account for the majority in the Provincial Cultural Work Troupe and the Cultural Work Troupes in Kashgar, Yili, Aksu and other places. This guarantees the national characteristics of the art troupes to a certain extent. At the same time, we must vigorously train leading cadres of culture and art of all ethnic groups so that they can gradually shoulder the heavy responsibility of developing the culture and art of all ethnic groups.

Among all ethnic groups, there is still a considerable number of folk artists, many of whom are excellent artists loved by the masses. This is one of the important sources for the ethnic cultural and artistic departments to expand the ethnic cadre. The Inner Mongolia National Song and Dance Theater has absorbed some excellent folk artists. Xinjiang Province has discovered more than 300 folk artists in southern Xinjiang alone. Both Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang have used the method of holding representative meetings or running training classes to train folk artists and help them improve their political understanding and artistic accomplishment, which is very important work. Sima Guler, a famous folk poet of the Kazakh nationality, described his mood in this way: "In the past, I was like a blocked spring. If no one dug it, it would never flow again. The care of the Party and the government for me is equivalent to digging up this spring, and now it has flowed." Our responsibility is to dig up the inexhaustible springs in all ethnic groups, so that thousands of small streams converge into rivers, irrigating the splendid national art and literature.

Ethnic minority cultural and artistic work is an inseparable part of the national cultural and artistic work, and it is also an important front in the Party's leadership of ethnic work. The development of this work is of extremely important significance to the prosperity of the motherland's cultural and artistic undertakings and the further construction of the ethnic minority areas.

    关于发展少数民族文艺工作的几个问题
    钟洛
    每一个在少数民族地区从事文化艺术工作的人，都会叙述一些亲身经历过的情景：少数民族的群众围住歌舞团员或放映队员不散，拥抱他们，感谢他们；人们翻山越岭，从百十里外带着干粮来看电影。“毛主席派人来演戏了！”这件事本身就是温暖，就是力量，人们看到本民族的子弟能上台演戏，比什么都感动。内蒙古有一个放映队去牧区，老乡们看到四个队员全是蒙族的，流着泪说：“想不到蒙古人也会使机器了！”……
    这一类动人的故事说不完。少数民族的文化艺术事业，就在各族人民如此热烈的支持下，一年比一年发展。内蒙古自治区成立以来的七年中，电影队、电影院的数目，和刚解放时相比，已经扩大了六倍；内蒙古人民出版社从一九四八年到去年年底，出版了四十一种蒙文文艺书籍，今年一年内计划出版三十五种；新疆省现在已有十二个专业和四十多个半专业的艺术团体，各族文艺干部一千六百多人；新疆省从一九五○年到一九五三年，放映了近四百部影片，使从来没有看过电影的人都看到电影；西康电影教育工作队两年间在藏族自治区和凉山彝族自治区等地放映了四百多场；桂西僮族自治区仅宜山专区就有二十一个文工团队，在一个月内就演出三百多场，观众四十多万人。电影、戏剧、歌舞、画报、幻灯、展览会……各种内容各种形式的文艺活动，已经日益成为各族人民文化生活中不可缺少的部分了。
    要进一步发展少数民族文化艺术工作，我认为应该注意下述几个问题。
    少数民族文化艺术工作的发展，不能脱离各民族自己的独特的艺术传统。祖国各民族都有自己的丰富的艺术遗产。由于各民族长期遭受帝国主义、封建势力和国民党大汉族主义的压迫，在文化艺术上受尽了摧残，从人民的口头上和琴弦上去探索艺术遗产，是一件十分艰巨的工作。新疆省在一九五一年搜集了一千多首民歌，一九五二年在南疆，半年内又搜集了两千多首；而被称为“维吾尔音乐之母”的“十二玛卡姆”大曲的录音、记谱和整理，更是一件极有意义的事情；内蒙古的蒙汉族文艺工作者，对蒙古民族的民歌、民间故事、谚语和舞蹈素材的搜集，做了不少工作，已经出版了“东蒙民歌选集”、“爬山歌选”、叙事长诗“嘎达梅林”和蒙文的“谚语”；云南省文艺工作者纪录整理了彝族美丽的长诗“阿诗玛”。这些工作，为本地区文艺工作者学习民族艺术遗产以发展新的民族文艺提供了宝贵的材料，并且使这部分遗产从部分地区扩大成为全民族共同的艺术财富。
    内蒙古锡林郭勒盟著名的民间艺人松代告诉我：内蒙古地区普遍流传的口头文学，光是歌谣，就有抒情歌、颂歌、喜歌、对唱、“好来宝”、谚语、谜语等等，都是各有特色，但现在会唱的人已经不多。他说：“有些歌子，现在只有些五六十岁以上的人才会唱了。”从松代所说的材料看，在内蒙，除民歌和谚语外，其他都还没有着手整理。即使民歌和谚语的整理也还只是开始。我们的搜集和整理工作还需要更有计划、有领导地进行。首先需要有专人和专门机构。西康藏族自治区在一年前就成立了吸收民间艺人参加的艺术研究会，进行对藏族民族歌舞的搜集和研究工作，这是完全必要的。
    各民族的艺术遗产正如我们所有的文化遗产一样，有菁华也有糟粕。因此，对待各民族的艺术遗产，同样应该遵循“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针，按照各民族的特点，在不同的民族艺术遗产的土壤上，培植不同的艺术的花朵。这是一个十分细致的工作，要坚决摒弃任何主观的、粗暴的做法，也要反对那种庸俗的“猎奇”心理。中央民族学院民族文工团在贵州苗族地区工作时，就曾因为没有认真研究苗族歌舞的特点和当地的实际情况，离开了苗族人民所喜爱的民族歌舞形式，结果，演出得不到苗族人民的喜好；后来，他们在西康藏族地区，经过踏实的了解和学习，将民族舞蹈“丰收”在原有的基础上进行整理，在音乐和舞蹈上都保存了原有的风格，就受到了群众的欢迎。
    在民族艺术传统的基础上生根和发展，并不拒绝和排斥吸收其他民族文艺的优秀的东西。恰恰相反，这是为发展新的民族文化艺术所必需的。我们要提倡各民族之间更多的文化艺术的交流。对少数民族的文化艺术工作者来说，学习汉民族的先进的文化艺术，对本民族文艺工作的发展是极其需要的。
    民族文化艺术团体（歌舞团、话剧团、电影队、文工队等）是党向各族人民传播精神食粮的有力工具，因此，民族文化艺术团体不能离开民族的土壤。对于这些团体的最起码的要求，是立足于民族地区，和少数民族人民共呼吸，同生活，保持千丝万缕的联系。在民族聚居地区，这个问题还不突出，但“西南地区的民族文艺团体大多数（除康定和昌都外）都停留在汉族占主要人口的城市内，大都还没有接触过兄弟民族人民的生活。虽然西南民族学院和贵州民族学院的文工团（队）与兄弟民族有经常的接触，但也多限于在民族学院内部，而在兄弟民族地区长期生活和学习的时间还太少，因而对兄弟民族生活和民族文艺的体会、发掘还是不够深的。”（吴晓邦：“在西南兄弟民族文艺工作中的体会”，“西南文艺”一九五四年四月号）自然，民族杂居的西南地区不同于像内蒙古那样便利，但如果我们的艺术团体经常地飘浮在上面，就像断绝了滋养的花朵，除掉逐渐枯萎以外，还会有什么别的前途呢？
    要使民族地区的文化艺术团体在民族地区生下根，在文化艺术活动的内容和方式方法上，必须适应民族地区的特点。在内容上，需要大量的表现各民族新生活的文学艺术创作，特别是通俗的文艺作品，需要保存和发扬各民族绚烂多彩的音乐舞蹈；在活动方式方法上，也不能单纯是大型的剧场演出。譬如说，在幅员广阔、人口分散的内蒙古地区，人们不满足于一年一度那达慕大会上的文艺活动，这就需要以小型多样的分散活动为主，如果有六、七个人或更少些的小型流动的组织，以歌舞演唱为主，带上幻灯、展览图片、画报等等，一辆大车，就可以深入牧区，深入蒙古包。同样，像西南山地，交通阻塞，也需要化整为零，分散演出。按照内蒙古自治区几个盟组织文化服务队的经验，这是切合实际也受群众欢迎的。
    我们的文化艺术团体还要同时负担带动群众业余艺术活动的任务，开展各族人民在工厂、农村、牧区和学校中的文艺活动，在这种紧密联系下，专业的民族艺术团体会得到源源不尽的新鲜的滋养。
    要使少数民族地区的文化艺术生下根，关键在于培养更高的民族文化艺术干部。
    首先，要十分关心少数民族的作家和艺术家的生长。近年来，出现了一些优秀的文学艺术作品，这些作品在内容上突破了解放初期单纯叙述翻身喜悦的范围，描绘了各民族的新的生活和新的人物，展示了各民族前进的道路。在形式上，也更多地运用了为各少数民族人民所喜闻乐见的民族形式。这些作者们，大都是长期生活在少数民族地区，他们熟悉本民族人民的心理和风习，他们感受了本民族地区人民生活中的新的、前进的力量，因而他们的作品就比较成功。我们也出现了一批为群众所欢迎的少数民族的演员、歌唱家和画家。这些都是可喜的现象，少数民族地区的文化艺术团体，应该把不断地提高民族作家和艺术家们的创作能力和表演能力，看作是自己重要的职责。
    也要鼓励各少数民族的作家用本民族的文字进行创作并给以出版的机会。把少数民族的作品译成汉文、介绍到汉族地区来，也是一件极重要的工作。
    其次，要逐步地扩大各地区文化艺术部门和民族艺术团体内民族干部的成员。少数民族的文化艺术干部，是开展少数民族文艺工作的纽带。他们既可以反映本民族的意见和要求，又可以把新的东西传达给本民族。现在不少地区的文化艺术部门和民族艺术团体内民族干部是占的比例很少的。西南民族学院文工队里，只有藏族二人，彝族二人，回族六人，维吾尔族三人；四川省藏族自治区歌舞团七十个团员中，藏族只有五人。这种情况，在开始时自然是难免的，需要逐渐改进。在内蒙古民族歌舞剧团，有百分之八十是蒙族干部；锡林郭勒盟的文化服务队全部是蒙族干部。新疆的省文工团和喀什、伊犁、阿克苏等地的文工团中，少数民族艺术干部也都占大多数。这就在一定程度上保证了艺术团体的民族色彩。同时，要大力培养各民族文化艺术的领导干部，使他们能逐渐负担起发展各民族文化艺术的重责。
    在各民族中，还有相当大的数量的民间艺人，其中有不少是为群众所敬爱的优秀艺人。这是民族文化艺术部门扩大民族干部的重要来源之一。内蒙古民族歌舞剧团，就吸收了一些优秀的民间艺人。新疆省仅在南疆一地，就已发现了三百多位民间艺人。内蒙古和新疆都曾运用开代表会议或是办训练班的方式，训练民间艺人，帮助他们提高政治认识和艺术修养，这是很重要的工作。哈萨克族著名的民间诗人司马古勒这样描述过自己的心情：“以前我好比一股堵塞的泉水，如果没有人挖掘它，就再不会流了。党和政府对我的关怀，等于挖开了这股泉水，现在已经流起来了。”我们的责任，正是挖开各民族中间的源源不绝的泉水，让千万条细流汇成江河，灌溉着如花似锦的各民族文艺。
    少数民族文化艺术工作是全国文化艺术工作的一个不可分离的部分，也是党在领导民族工作中的一个重要的战线。这方面工作的发展，对祖国文化艺术事业的繁荣和各少数民族地区的进一步建设，都是有极重要的意义的。
