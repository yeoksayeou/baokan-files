Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 17th: The "Pravda" published an article by M. Avnin, entitled: "What is Hidden Behind the Goa Incident".

The author writes: The small Portuguese territories on the west coast of India—Goa, Daman, and Diu—have now become the object of special attention for many Western capitals. In recent years, the Portuguese government has repeatedly refused the Indian government's suggestion that the Portuguese authorities seek a fair solution to the problem of its territories in India, based on the interests of the local residents. In recent months, Portugal has intensified its hostile activities towards India.

The author points out that the reason why the Portuguese generals and diplomats have adopted such an unreasonable attitude is because the United States has become increasingly interested in the Portuguese territories on Indian soil. In the US's aggressive plans, this land has been regarded as a US naval and air base. Foreign newspapers have confirmed that military construction here is being carried out under the supervision of US generals.

The author continues: The West is not only attacking India with hostile propaganda, insisting that India is "invading" Portugal, but also intimidating India by sending warships to demonstrate off the Indian coast. Lisbon has demanded that Portuguese troops be allowed to pass through Indian territory to suppress the national liberation movement in Goa. Several Western governments participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have come out to support Portugal's demands in a demonstrative manner. The Vatican is also participating in the anti-Indian movement. It is noteworthy that the entire movement is "well organized" and directly linked to the US's plan to establish a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc.

Foreign commentators believe that the leaders of the anti-Indian movement are trying, on the one hand, to undermine the influence of India's negative policy towards the US-planned Southeast Asian military treaty on Asian countries, and on the other hand, to force India to participate in this treaty by putting pressure on it.

Avnin concludes by writing that the events surrounding the Goa issue show that the United States is frantically trying to quickly piece together a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc. To this end, they are using all means. The aggressors are eager to organize this bloc because the Asian people's resistance to US aggression plans is becoming increasingly fierce.

    果阿事件的背后隐藏着什么
    ——苏联“真理报”刊载的文章的摘要
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：“真理报”刊载了米·阿弗宁的一篇文章，题目是：“果阿事件的背后隐藏着什么”。
    作者写道：位在印度西海岸的不大的葡萄牙属地——果阿、达曼和第乌岛，现在已成为许多西方国家首都特别注意的对象。葡萄牙政府近年来一再拒绝印度政府建议葡萄牙当局从当地居民的利益出发，谋求公平解决它在印度的这些属地的问题。最近几个月来，葡萄牙更加加紧了敌视印度的活动。
    作者指出，葡萄牙的将军们和外交家们所以采取这样一种蛮不讲理的态度是因为美国对印度国土上的葡萄牙属地的兴趣越来越浓厚的缘故，在美国的侵略计划中，这片土地已被看成是美国的海军和空军基地，外国报纸证实，这里的军事建筑是在美国将军的监督下进行的。
    作者接着说：西方不仅在宣传上来敌意地攻击印度，硬说印度“侵略”葡萄牙，而且还对印度进行恫吓，把军舰派到印度海岸示威，里斯本要求让葡萄牙军队通过印度领土去镇压果阿的民族解放运动。参加北大西洋公约组织的若干西方国家政府都示威似地出来支持葡萄牙的要求。参加反印运动的还包括梵蒂冈，值得注意的是整个运动的“富有组织性”以及它和美国建立东南亚侵略集团的计划的直接联系。
    外国评论家认为，领导反印运动的人一方面力图破坏印度对美国策划东南亚军事条约所采取的否定政策对亚洲国家的影响，另一方面企图以对印度施加压力来迫使它参加这个条约。
    阿弗宁最后写道，围绕着果阿问题的事件说明，美国疯狂地力图迅速拼凑东南亚侵略集团。为了这个目的，他们运用了一切办法。侵略者迫不及待地想组织这个集团，还因为亚洲人民对美国侵略计划的反抗日益激烈。
