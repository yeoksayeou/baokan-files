Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 17th (TASS): "L'Humanité" published the statement of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party regarding the debate on the "European Defense Community" treaty in the French National Assembly on August 28th.

In its statement, the French Communist Party pointed out: "The American ruling clique is demanding that France approve the 'European Defense Community' treaty 'before the parliamentary recess'." Premier Mendès France said that he would raise a question of confidence at the end of this debate. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party sees this as: the government is trying hard to "seek approval" of this treaty, which is to "approve the revival of the German Wehrmacht, to approve the arming of German revanchists."

The Political Bureau explained the devastating consequences of the "European Defense Community". The Political Bureau then pointed out: According to some people who advocate arming West Germany, it seems that arming West Germany is "inevitable". The statement said: "However, the correct statement is another: as long as France says 'no', it will not be possible to arm German revanchists. In addition, the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a new conference provides an opportunity for a peaceful settlement, which rejects arming Germany, guarantees respect for France's national interests, and creates conditions for permanent reconciliation between the French and German peoples, thus meeting the security needs of European countries."

The Political Bureau pointed out that the majority of French people firmly condemn the Paris Treaty. Now, more efforts must be made to prevent this treaty from being approved by the National Assembly. The statement mentioned that the working class, all patriots, and peace defenders must act in unison to oppose the "European Army" in order to "eliminate the danger threatening the motherland and threatening peace."

    法共中央政治局发表声明
    号召法国爱国者反对“欧洲军”
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社巴黎十六日讯：“人道报”刊载了法国共产党中央委员会政治局关于八月二十八日法国国民议会辩论“欧洲防务集团”条约的声明。
    法国共产党在声明中指出：“美国统治集团要求法国在议会休假之前”批准“欧洲防务集团”条约。总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯说，他要在这次辩论结束时提出信任问题，法国共产党政治局把这看作是：政府竭力要“求得批准”这个条约，也就是“赞成复活德国国防军，赞成武装德国复仇主义者”。
    政治局说明了“欧洲防务集团”蕴藏着毁灭性的后果。政治局接着指出：根据主张武装西德的一些人的说法，似乎武装西德是“不可避免的”。声明说：“然而正确的是另外一种说法：只要法国说一声‘不’，要武装德国复仇主义者就办不到。此外，苏联提出的关于召开一次新的会议的建议提供了和平解决的机会，这种和平解决摈弃武装德国，保证尊重法国的民族利益，创造法国人民和德国人民永久和好的条件，因而符合欧洲各国安全的要求。”
    政治局指出：大多数法国人都坚决地指责巴黎条约。现在必须再作努力，不让这个条约被国民议会批准。声明谈到工人阶级、全体爱国者及和平保卫者必须一致行动起来，反对“欧洲军”，以便“消除威胁着祖国、威胁着和平的危险”。
