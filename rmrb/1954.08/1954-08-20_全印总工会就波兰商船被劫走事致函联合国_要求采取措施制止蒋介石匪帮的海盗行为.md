Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 16th. The Polish Press Agency reports that the Polish Trade Union Central Council recently received a copy of a letter from the All-India Trade Union Congress to the United Nations regarding the hijacking of the Polish merchant ship "Gottwald" by Chiang Kai-shek's pirates.

The letter points out that the All-India Trade Union Congress learned that on May 13th of this year, a Kuomintang gunboat attacked the Polish merchant ship "Gottwald" and forcibly hijacked the ship to Kaohsiung Port in Taiwan. It is noteworthy that this attack was carried out after reconnaissance by aircraft bearing US Air Force markings.

The hijacking of the merchant ship "Gottwald" is another act of piracy committed by Kuomintang elements. There is no doubt that such acts of piracy are committed with the assistance of the US government, which, as everyone knows, controls the actions of Kuomintang elements.

Everyone remembers that in October 1953, another merchant ship of the Polish People's Republic, the "Work," was subjected to a completely similar attack and was also hijacked to a port in Taiwan.

Now, there is good reason to worry about the fate of the crew of the "Gottwald." It is said that the Polish crew members have been detained on the ship and are prohibited from communicating with the outside world. The twelve Chinese crew members on board have been imprisoned by the Kuomintang police. According to news from Taiwan, the Chiang Kai-shek regime will try them on charges of "treason."

We know that the Chiang Kai-shek regime harbors hatred in all its actions against the People's Republic of China and the liberated Chinese people. Therefore, we believe that the United Nations should immediately intervene in this matter to save the twelve Chinese sailors.

The letter emphasizes: We urge the United Nations to take immediate and appropriate measures to stop international piracy.

    全印总工会就波兰商船被劫走事致函联合国
    要求采取措施制止蒋介石匪帮的海盗行为
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社华沙十六日讯：波兰通讯社报道，最近波兰工会中央理事会接到了全印（印度）总工会就波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德”号被蒋介石海盗劫走一事致联合国信件的副本。
    信件指出，全印总工会得悉，今年五月十三日，一艘国民党炮舰袭击波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德”号，并用武力把这艘商船劫往台湾的高雄港。值得注意的是，这一攻击行为是在有美国空军标志的飞机预先侦察之后进行的。
      “哥特瓦尔德”号商船的被劫，是国民党分子所干的又一次海盗行为，毫无疑问，干出这种海盗行为，不是没有美国政府的协助的，大家知道，美国政府是控制着国民党分子的行动的。
    大家还记得，在一九五三年十月，波兰人民共和国的另一艘商船“工作”号也曾受到完全类似的攻击，这艘商船也被劫往台湾的某一港口。
    现在，有充分理由为“哥特瓦尔德”号商船的船员的遭遇担心。据说，波兰船员已被拘禁在船上，他们并被禁止和外界通信，船上的十二名中国船员已被国民党警察囚禁在监狱里。据台湾发出的消息说，蒋介石政权将以“叛国”的罪名对他们进行审判。
    我们知道，蒋介石政权在对中华人民共和国、对解放了的中国人民采取的一切行动中都怀着仇恨，因此，我们认为：联合国应立即过问这一事件，以拯救十二名中国海员。
    信件着重说：我们要求联合国立即采取应有的措施，制止国际海盗行为。
