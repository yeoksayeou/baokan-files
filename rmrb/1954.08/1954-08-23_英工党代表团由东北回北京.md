Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: The British Labour Party delegation, led by Mr. Attlee, flew back to Beijing on the afternoon of the 22nd after visiting Northeast China. On their way back to Beijing, the delegation stopped in Tangshan and visited the Kailuan Coal Mine.

Mr. Bevan, Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Watson entered the mine. Accompanied by Sun Yueqi, Deputy Director of the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration, they traveled more than 4,000 meters underground by trolley to the coal face. They saw modern conveyor belts for transporting coal.

More than 78% of the Kailuan Coal Mine's shafts are mechanized. Before liberation, almost all operations were done manually.

The Tangshan mine director said that Soviet aid and technical assistance have adopted newer and safer coal cutting methods. The accident rate has been reduced by 80% compared to before liberation.

Mr. Attlee, Dr. Summerskill, and other representatives visited the workers' canteen.

In the afternoon, Dr. Summerskill and other representatives visited miners' families. Since liberation, more than 13,000 houses have been built for the workers. This is equal to the total number of rooms built by the coal mine in the 71 years before liberation. The representatives also visited a Catholic church and a Christian church near the mining area.

    英工党代表团由东北回北京
   【新华社二十二日讯】以艾德礼先生为首的英国工党代表团在到东北访问后，在二十二日下午飞回北京。代表团在回北京的途中，在唐山停留并参观了开滦煤矿。
    比万先生、菲利普斯先生和华生先生进入矿井中。他们在开滦煤矿总管理处副主任孙越崎的陪同下乘电车在地下走了四千多公尺而到煤的采掘面。他们看到了运煤的现代化传送带。
    开滦煤矿有百分之七十八以上的矿井已机械化。解放前，一切操作差不多全是用人力进行的。
    唐山矿长说，苏联的援助和技术帮助采用了较新的和较安全的截煤方法。事故发生率已比解放前减少百分之八十。
    艾德礼先生、萨末斯基尔博士和其他代表参观了工人食堂。
    下午，萨末斯基尔博士和其他代表访问了矿工家庭。自从解放以来，已为工人们建筑了一万三千多间房子。这等于这个煤矿在解放前的七十一年中所建筑的房间的总数。代表们还参观了矿区附近一所天主教堂和一所基督教堂。
