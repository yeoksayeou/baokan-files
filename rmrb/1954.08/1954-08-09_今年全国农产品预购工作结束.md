Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: This year's work of cooperatives accepting state commissions to pre-purchase grain, cotton, peanuts, hemp for sacks, tea, and wool has concluded. According to statistics from the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, the pre-purchase plans for major grain-producing areas such as Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu; major cotton-producing areas such as Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi; major peanut-producing areas such as Hebei, Shandong, and Henan; major hemp-producing areas such as Zhejiang; and wool products in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have all been overfulfilled. Hebei Province holds an important position in the nation's cotton production, and the province's cotton pre-purchase plan is nearing completion, reaching over 93%. Through the state's extensive pre-purchase work via cooperatives, a large quantity of grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods have been secured early. However, from a national perspective, apart from the cotton pre-purchase plan being fulfilled, other pre-purchase plans have only been completed by around 70% or 80%. This is mainly because this work started relatively late in many regions this year.

According to incomplete statistics, the total amount of deposits paid to farmers by the state in pre-purchases reached over 1.2 trillion yuan. At the same time, farmers were also supplied with a large amount of agricultural tools, fertilizers, and seeds, greatly boosting their production enthusiasm. Some farmers call the state's pre-purchase during the lean season "sending charcoal in the snow." This year, Liu'an Special District in Anhui Province invested 17.5 billion yuan in pre-purchase deposits, thus enabling farmers to avoid being subjected to tens of millions of yuan in usurious exploitation. Due to the state's strong support for production through pre-purchase and other methods, farmers have expanded the planting area of cotton, jute, kenaf, and oil crops according to the state plan this year. This year, the national cotton planting area exceeded the state plan. In the southern part of Shanxi Province, nine counties originally planned to plant over 980,000 mu of cotton. After the state carried out pre-purchase and other work, farmers actually planted 1.03 million mu of cotton. In Shanxi, Zhejiang, Henan, and other places, some cotton-planting farmers, after signing pre-purchase contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives, revised their production plans and changed land originally intended for planting sweet potatoes, watermelons, and miscellaneous grains, but suitable for planting cotton, to cotton cultivation.

### 今年全国农产品预购工作结束

    今年全国农产品预购工作结束
      【新华社八日讯】今年合作社接受国家委托预购粮食、棉花、花生、麻袋用麻、茶叶和羊毛等产品的工作，已经结束。据中华全国供销合作总社的统计材料，主要粮食产区山东、河南、江苏，主要棉花产区河南、山东、山西，主要花生产区河北、山东、河南，主要麻产区浙江以及内蒙古自治区的羊毛等产品的预购计划都已超额完成。河北省棉花产量在全国占有重要地位，全省棉花预购计划现已接近完成，达到百分之九十三以上。国家通过合作社广泛的预购工作，及早掌握了大批粮食、工业原料和出口物资。但从全国范围来看，除棉花预购计划完成以外，其他预购计划只完成了百分之七十或八十左右。这主要是因为今年这个工作在不少地区开始的较晚。
    据不完全统计，国家在预购中付给农民的订金总额达一万二千多亿元，同时并供给农民大批农具、肥料和种籽，大大鼓舞了农民的生产热情。有些农民把国家在青黄不接时期的预购称为“雪里送炭”，安徽省六安专区今年投放预购订金一百七十五亿元，使农民因而避免遭受高利贷剥削数千万元。由于国家通过预购以及用其他办法有力地支援了生产，今年农民根据国家计划扩大了棉花、黄麻、洋麻、油料作物的播种面积。今年全国棉田播种面积超过了国家计划。山西省南部有九个县原计划种棉九十八万多亩，国家进行预购和其他工作后，农民实际种棉一百零三万亩。山西、浙江、河南等地有些植棉农民，和供销合作社订立预购合同后，重新修改了生产计划，把原来打算种红薯、西瓜和杂粮而又适于种棉的土地改种了棉花。
