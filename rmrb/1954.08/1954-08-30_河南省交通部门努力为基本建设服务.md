Henan Province Transportation Department is actively organizing transportation forces to support national basic construction projects. In Zhengzhou alone, nearly 10,000 tons of materials are transported every day. Zhengzhou搬运 (Banyun) Transportation Company has absorbed 3,000 pushcarts and transferred 90 horse-drawn carts from Kaifeng to enhance transportation capacity for basic construction. Puyang, Xuchang, and Kaifeng, among other places, have transferred 72 automobiles and 300 horse-drawn carts to support the construction of Luoyang. Five hundred horse-drawn carts drawn from various locations are also heading to construction sites in mining areas such as Pingdingshan, Jiaozuo, and Yiluo. Highway surveying and engineering teams active near various important construction sites are rushing to repair transportation lines. The Henan Provincial People's Government Transportation Department recently held a meeting specifically to discuss the issue of supporting basic construction and decided to quickly establish unified leadership organizations for transportation in key cities, strengthen the management and dispatch of various transportation tools, in order to better serve basic construction.

    河南省交通部门努力为基本建设服务
    河南省交通部门积极组织运输力量，支援国家基本建设工程。仅郑州一地，每天就要运输近万吨的物资；郑州搬运公司吸收了三千多辆架子车，并从开封调了九十辆马车来增强基本建设的运输力量。濮阳许昌和开封等地，调出了七十二辆汽车、三百辆马车，支援洛阳的建设。从各地抽调的五百辆马车也分别开往平顶山、焦作和宜洛等矿区的工地。活跃在各重要工地附近的公路测量队和工程队，正在赶修着运输线。河南省人民政府交通厅最近召开会议，专门讨论了关于支援基本建设的问题；并决定迅速建立重点城市交通运输的统一领导机构，加强对于各种运输工具的管理和调度，以便更好地为基本建设服务。
