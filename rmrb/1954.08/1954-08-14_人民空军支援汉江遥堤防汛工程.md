    People's Air Force Supports Flood Control Project on the Han River Embankment

    On the 12th, the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission dispatched three transport planes to a location near Shayang, Jingmen County, to airdrop flood control materials in support of the Han River remote embankment flood control project, which concerns the lives and property of five to six million people in more than ten counties including Zhongxiang, Jingshan, and Qianjiang. Since the beginning of this month, the upper reaches of the Han River have experienced three successive flood peaks, each higher than the last. In order to save time and ensure the remote embankment, a large amount of flood control materials are urgently needed to reinforce the levee. Upon hearing this, the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission dispatched three transport planes to the area on the 12th to airdrop flood control materials. The airdrop went smoothly, and all the flood control materials were accurately dropped at the designated locations.

    The People's Revolutionary Military Commission's dispatch of aircraft to airdrop flood control materials not only provided timely support for the Han River flood control work, winning time for the final victory over the flood, but also strengthened the determination of local flood control cadres, military personnel, and civilian laborers to overcome the flood. The laborers said with emotion: "Chairman Mao cares about us so much, sending the air force to support us. What difficulties can't we overcome!"

    人民空军支援汉江遥堤防汛工程
    中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会于十二日派运输机三架至荆门县沙洋附近空投防汛器材，支援关系着钟祥、京山、潜江等十余县五、六百万人民生命财产安全的汉江遥堤防汛工程。本月上旬起，汉江上游接连出现了三次洪峰，一次比一次高，为了争取时间，确保遥堤，急需大量防汛器材加固堤防。中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会闻讯后，特于十二日派出运输机三架前往该地空投防汛器材。空投进行顺利，全部防汛器材均准确地投到了预定地点。
    人民革命军事委员会此次派飞机空投防汛器材，不仅及时地支援了汉江防汛工作，为最后战胜洪水争取了时间，同时也坚定了当地防汛干部、军工、民工战胜洪水的决心。民工们感动地说：“毛主席这样关怀我们，派空军来支援我们，我们还有什么困难不能克服！”
