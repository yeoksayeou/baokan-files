Strengthening Urban Construction to Meet the Needs of Industrial Construction
Sun Jingwen, Director of the Urban Construction Bureau of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering

With the progress of the nation’s planned economic construction, urban construction in our country is becoming increasingly important.

The cities of old China were built for the benefit of the ruling classes of past dynasties. Some were feudal consumer cities, such as Beijing, Xi'an, and Kaifeng. These cities had little or no modern industry; in terms of urban layout, although some still exhibited solemnity, symmetry, and order, giving them a certain value and status in the history of urban construction, they were entirely built according to the will of the feudal emperors, fully reflecting their thoughts of self-importance, supreme power, and suppression and defense against peasant "rebellion." Some were typical semi-colonial cities, such as Shanghai and Tianjin. These cities had some modern industry, but the foundation was very weak, disproportionate to the large population in the city; in terms of the material and technical level of the buildings, although they were a step forward compared to the buildings of the feudal era, the entire city had no center, and each foreign concession was an independent kingdom, with each concession's water supply, drainage, roads, electricity, telecommunications, etc., forming its own system, fully demonstrating the state of imperialist carving up of China and claiming hegemony. There was also a type of city established by an imperialist power during its occupation, such as Changchun. Although this type of city had a unified layout, it was only to meet the needs of the occupiers. In short, in the past, no matter what type of city in our country, they all served the reactionary ruling class, while the broad masses of working people were squeezed into low-lying, narrow, and unsanitary areas, with small houses, crowded living conditions, no running water and drainage facilities, not to mention parks, schools, hospitals, or theaters.

After liberation, these cities, which had served the reactionary ruling class, became cities serving the people. In the past few years, although the state's finances have been very difficult, all localities have done a lot of work in the construction of civil housing, the construction of public utilities, and the improvement of sanitation, the scale of which is incomparable to that of any reactionary ruling class in history. In total, from 1950 to 1954, according to incomplete data on public utilities, the central and local governments invested more than 10 trillion yuan in urban capital construction (excluding housing investment). According to statistics from twenty cities as of the end of 1953, water pipelines increased by more than 1,900 kilometers; sewer pipes increased by more than 1,490 kilometers. Six cities added more than 370 trams, and nineteen cities added more than 1,400 buses; three cities added more than 130 trolleybuses. In terms of housing and public buildings: in 1952, five cities, Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Anshan, and Shanghai, built about 5 million square meters of workers' housing. Since liberation, Beijing has built more than 6 million square meters of public buildings and housing. In the Northeast region, as of 1952, the construction area of housing and public buildings had reached 15 million square meters. In terms of roads, the four cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing alone built 7.2 million square meters as of 1952. In terms of improving environmental sanitation, Beijing dredged the Three Seas and eliminated the old Dragon Beard Ditch; Tianjin renovated the Qiangzi River and Jinzhong River, greatly improving the environmental sanitation of these dirty areas where the laboring people have gathered for generations. At the same time, the above-mentioned construction has also played a certain role in coordinating with the restoration of the national economy.

With the start of the nation's planned economic construction, urban construction in our country has also entered a new stage: in order to meet the needs of industrial construction, several new industrial cities will be built in places with no industrial base and no public utility base; some cities with a certain industrial base and modern equipment will also need to be renovated or expanded as necessary. The planned and rational layout of various industrial, transportation, housing, cultural, educational, and health buildings in these newly built and expanded cities, and the carrying out of huge municipal construction work to ensure the needs of production and the convenience of the working and living of the working people, has become the current important combat task of our urban construction workers.

In the year or so since the start of the national Five-Year Construction Plan, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, urban construction work has made achievements. In addition to the work in housing, public utilities, and sanitation, urban construction work organizations have been established in various regions and larger cities, planning and design have been carried out in some key cities, a certain number of cadres have been trained, and some experience has been accumulated. However, because urban construction work is a new task for us, everyone lacks experience, ideological preparation and organizational preparation are insufficient, and the understanding of the importance, purpose, and comprehensiveness of urban construction is insufficient, while the objective requirements are very urgent, some shortcomings and errors have inevitably arisen. Among these shortcomings and errors, the most important are the following two points:

1. The urban planning and design and the construction of public utilities have not kept up with the needs of industrial construction, which has affected the country's construction work to varying degrees in many cities.

2. There is a serious blindness and decentralization in urban construction work.

The fundamental difference between a socialist city and a capitalist city is that a socialist city serves socialist industry and the working people. The material basis of a socialist city is socialist industry, and urban construction must meet the needs of the development of socialist industry and serve the urban working people. However, some urban construction workers use the viewpoints of capitalist urban construction to carry out planning and design, such as emphasizing commerce or overestimating the non-productive population when estimating urban development. Some comrades have the idea of blind advancement, such as excessively emphasizing the importance and favorable conditions of their cities and planning the city too large; they are unwilling to use and renovate the old city and only want to build new urban areas; in terms of public utilities, environmental sanitation, and welfare facilities, they do not distinguish between priorities and are eager to achieve quick results. Some comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the development conditions and development prospects of their cities and blindly arrange factories and schools, causing difficulties in the layout of large enterprises in the future. Other problems, such as the lack of reliable natural data as the basis for planning and design, and the failure to calculate costs, are also manifestations of blindness in urban construction work.

The decentralization of urban construction is mainly manifested in some construction units going their own way, randomly asking for land, building everywhere, and blindly building, resulting in not only the dispersion of funds and the inability to make full use of equipment, but also the destruction of the integrity of the city, creating numerous difficulties for future construction. Of course, this is inseparable from the untimely overall urban planning and the lack of a unified management system, which must be corrected by the joint efforts of the urban construction sector and various construction units.

Recently, the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering convened the first National Urban Construction Conference, which clearly pointed out that the cities of New China serve socialist industrialization, the working people, and the working class, and that urban construction must be carried out with emphasis and in steps based on the general task of the state during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan. Based on this policy, the conference roughly divided our country's cities into the following four categories: The first category of cities is characterized by the construction of many new industrial enterprises and the opening up of new industrial areas. These new industrial cities generally have a very poor original industrial base, lack the necessary data, face difficult technical conditions, and have a very tight construction schedule, requiring strong national support; the second category is cities that need to be expanded with the expansion and construction of industry; the third category of cities has few industrial construction tasks and only needs to carry out local renovation and expansion, mainly strengthening the maintenance and management of public utilities and improving environmental sanitation; the fourth category is small and medium-sized cities with no new construction, basically carrying out the maintenance and management of public utilities and doing a good job in environmental sanitation. The first category of cities should become the focus of urban construction during the Five-Year Plan period. For a city, construction should also be carried out with emphasis: it is necessary to first build industrial areas, first concentrate forces to solve basic problems such as water supply, drainage, roads, and transportation around the needs of industrial construction, and not advance on all fronts, with everything being revitalized, and using manpower and materials equally.

According to the requirements of the above-mentioned policies and tasks, urban construction departments should focus on the following tasks in the future:

1. Strengthen urban planning and design work: urban planning is the continuation and concretization of national economic work, and is a method of planning and arranging various constructions in the urban area in a planned way and making them coordinate with each other. At present, some important cities cannot make overall urban plans in time, and cannot carry out unified layout for urban development, which has affected the construction of factories, housing, transportation, etc. If they cannot catch up in time, it will delay the construction time and affect production. Therefore, urban planning and design work must be stepped up, and important cities with more industrial construction should quickly organize forces to formulate draft overall urban plans.

In order to carry out urban planning, it is necessary to conduct investigations, surveys, and research on natural data such as topography, geology, hydrology, and wind direction.

Urban construction is a matter of a century, and its possible development must be considered according to the national industrial construction plan. That is, a comprehensive plan must be formulated based on the needs of near-term industrial construction combined with long-term development prospects, which can not only meet current needs but also ensure long-term benefits. The first phase of construction should be as concentrated and compact as possible to save land and municipal construction investment, and at the same time, appropriate places should be left for the second phase and long-term construction.

When planning, we should also try to improve the utilization rate of old cities, and we must correct the idea of abandoning old urban areas and completely rebuilding new urban areas.

Urban construction should also pay attention to the issue of artistic form. A city, a building complex, or a building should not only provide comfortable living and working conditions for the working people, but also express a certain artistic and ideological nature, reflecting the greatness and beauty of the socialist era. At present, we have not yet created a mature set of things. Architectural art, like literature, fine arts, drama, and music, needs to absorb various excellent achievements from China and abroad, both ancient and modern, abandoning its reactionary parts that are not suitable for modern Chinese construction conditions and requirements, and absorbing its progressive parts that are suitable for Chinese national characteristics for creation. The requirements for the artistic form of urban architecture must also be adapted to our country's current economic and technical conditions, that is, it should also be carried out with emphasis. For example, permanent commemorative tall buildings must pay attention to beauty and magnificence, while general buildings do not necessarily require high artistry. At the same time, the design of artistic forms must pay attention to the principle of frugality, and the cost cannot be increased in order to pursue artistic forms.

2. Establish a supervision and management system for urban construction: In the past few years, the phenomenon of blindness and decentralization in urban construction has been inseparable from the lack of a unified supervision and management system. There is definitely more than one construction unit in a city. If each construction unit goes its own way, it will be impossible to guarantee the overall interests of the city and the needs of industrial construction. Therefore, the establishment of a supervision and management system for urban construction is really urgent. Many cities have successively established urban construction committees, which have organs to implement this system; many cities have successively completed preliminary draft plans, which have created conditions and basis for the implementation of supervision and management. The recently held first National Urban Construction Conference also discussed a draft regulation on strengthening urban construction management. After this regulation is promulgated and implemented, the situation in this regard will be further improved.

3. Strengthen the construction and management of various public utilities in cities: In order to directly coordinate with the industrial plant construction tasks and production tasks, we must especially step up the design and construction of various off-site projects.

4. Formulate necessary urban economic and technical quotas: Urban economic and technical quotas are a sign of the current and future economic and living standards of the city, and are one of the main bases for determining the size of the urban area and the rational organization of housing, public buildings, greening, industry, railways, warehouses, etc., as well as the economically rational allocation of land. At present, urban planning quotas should be formulated first to meet the needs of urban planning and construction.

The task of urban construction in New China is arduous and glorious. I hope that urban construction workers and architects in various places will work together to complete this task!

    适应工业建设需要加强城市建设工作
    中央建筑工程部城市建设局局长　孙敬文
    随着国家有计划的经济建设的进展，我国的城市建设工作也越来越重要了。
    旧中国的城市是为了历代统治阶级的利益建设起来的。其中有的是封建性的消费城市，如北京、西安、开封等。这些城市几乎没有或只有很少的近代化工业；在城市的布局上有的虽还表现得庄严、对称、整齐，在城市建设史上有它一定的价值与地位，但它完全是按照封建帝王的意志建成的，充分反映了封建帝王唯我独尊、至高无上和镇压农民、防御农民“造反”的思想。有的是典型的半殖民地城市，如上海、天津等。这些城市虽有一些近代化的工业，但基础十分薄弱，与城市中众多的人口很不相称；在建筑物的物质与技术水平上虽比封建时代的建筑物进了一步，但整个城市没有中心，每个外国租界都是一个独立王国，各个租界的给水、排水、道路、电力、电讯等都是自成系统，各搞一套，充分地表现了帝国主义对中国瓜分割据各自称霸的状态。还有一种是一个帝国主义在其占领期间所建立起来的城市，如长春。这种城市虽有统一的布置，但也只不过是适应占领者的需要。总之，过去我国不论那一类城市都是为反动统治阶级服务的，广大劳动人民则都被挤在低洼、狭窄，不卫生的地区，房屋矮小，居住拥挤，没有自来水和排水设备，更说不上公园、学校、医院或剧院了。
    解放之后，这些城市由为反动统治阶级服务的城市变成了为人民服务的城市。几年来，国家财政虽然很困难，但各地不论在民用住宅的建筑上或公用事业的修建上或卫生事业的改进上，都作了不少工作，其规模是历史上任何反动统治阶级所不能比拟的。总计自一九五○年到一九五四年的五年间，根据公用事业方面的不完整的资料估计，中央和地方对城市基本建设的投资共十万余亿元（不包括住宅投资）。据二十个城市截至一九五三年底的统计，自来水共增加管线一千九百多公里；下水道增加了一千四百九十多公里。有六个城市增加了三百七十多辆有轨电车，有十九个城市增加了一千四百多辆公共汽车；有三个城市增加了一百三十多辆无轨电车。在住宅与公共建筑物方面：一九五二年北京、天津、沈阳、鞍山、上海五个城市共建筑了五百万平方公尺左右的工人住宅，北京市自解放以来共修建了六百多万平方公尺的公共建筑与住宅，东北区截至一九五二年止，住宅和公共建筑物的建筑面积已达一千五百万平方公尺。在道路方面，仅北京、天津、上海和重庆四个城市截至一九五二年止即修建了七百二十万平方公尺。在改善环境卫生方面，北京疏浚了三海，消灭了旧龙须沟；天津整修了墙子河、金钟河，使这些历代劳动人民聚集的肮脏不堪的地区的环境卫生得到很大的改善。同时上述这些建设对国家经济的恢复也起了一定的配合作用。
      随着国家有计划经济建设的开始，我国城市建设也开始走上了新的阶段：为了适应工业建设的需要，若干新的工业城市要在过去没有工业基础与没有公用事业基础的地方建设起来；一些有一定工业基础及有近代设备的城市也要进行必要的改建或扩建。在这些新建与扩建的城市中有计划地合理地进行各种工业、交通、住宅、文教卫生等建筑的规划布置，为保证生产需要与劳动人民工作与生活的便利而进行巨大的市政建设工作，就成为我们城市建设工作者当前的重要的战斗任务。
    国家五年建设计划开始后的一年多来，在党与人民政府的领导之下，城市建设工作是有成绩的，除了在住宅、公用事业与卫生事业等方面的工作外，各地区与较大的城市都先后建立了城市建设工作机构，在一些重点城市中进行了规划设计，培养了一定数量的干部，也积累了一些经验。但是，由于城市建设工作对我们来说是一件新的工作，大家没有经验，思想准备与组织准备都很不够，对城市建设的重要性、目的性、综合性认识不足，而客观要求又很紧迫，就不可避免地随之产生一些缺点与错误。在这些缺点和错误中，最主要的有以下两点：
    一、城市规划设计与公用事业的建设工作赶不上工业建设的需要，致使许多城市在不同程度上影响了国家的建设工作。
    二、在城市建设工作中存在着严重的盲目性与分散性。
    社会主义城市与资本主义城市根本不同之点，就是社会主义城市是为社会主义工业与劳动人民服务的。社会主义城市的物质基础是社会主义工业，城市建设必须适应社会主义工业发展的需要，为城市劳动人民服务。但有些城市建设工作者却以资本主义城市建设的观点来进行规划设计，如在估计城市发展时强调商业或过高地估计非生产人口。有一些同志存在着盲目冒进的思想，如过分强调自己所在城市的重要性和有利条件，把城市规划得很大；不愿利用和改造旧城，只想另建新城区；在公用事业与环境卫生、福利设施等方面不分轻重缓急，急于求成等。还有一些同志则对自己所在城市的发展条件与发展远景认识不足，盲目地安排了工厂、学校，造成将来大企业布局的困难。其他如规划设计缺乏可靠的自然资料作依据，以及不计算造价等，也都是城市建设工作中盲目性的表现。
    城市建设的分散性主要表现在一些建设单位各自为政，乱要地皮，到处修建，盲目乱建，结果不仅资金分散，设备不能充分利用，而且破坏了城市的整体性，给将来的建设造成了重重困难。当然，这和城市总体规划不及时与缺乏统一的管理制度是分不开的，必须由城市建设方面与各个建设单位共同努力来纠正。
    最近中央建筑工程部召开了全国第一次城市建设会议，明确指出新中国的城市是为社会主义工业化、为劳动人民、为工人阶级服务的，城市建设必须根据国家过渡时期总任务与第一个五年计划的基本任务，有重点有步骤的进行。会议并根据这一方针，将我国的城市大体划分为以下四类：第一类城市的特点主要是新建许多工业企业，开辟了新的工业区，这些新的工业城市，一般是原有工业基础很差，缺乏必要的资料，技术条件困难，建设时间又很紧迫，必须全国大力支援；第二类是随着工业的扩建与新建，需要加以扩建的城市；第三类城市工业建设任务不多，只须进行局部的改建与扩建，主要是加强公用事业的维修与管理，改进环境卫生等工作；第四类是没有什么新的建设的中小城市，基本上是进行公用事业的维护管理与做好环境卫生等工作。其中第一类城市应成为五年计划时期中城市建设的重点。就一个城市来说，也要有重点地进行建设：必须先建设工业区，先集中力量围绕工业建设的需要解决给水、排水、道路、交通等基本问题，不能齐头并进、百废俱兴，平均地使用人力与物力。
    根据上述方针任务的要求，今后城市建设部门应集中力量进行以下几项工作：
    一、加强城市规划与设计工作：城市规划是国家经济工作的继续和具体化，是一种有计划的在市区内对各种建设进行布置并使其相互配合的方法。目前有些重要城市由于不能及时作出城市总体规划，对城市发展不能进行统一布局，已影响了工厂、住宅、交通运输等方面的建设，如不能及时赶上去，就会推迟建设时间，影响生产。故城市规划设计工作必须加紧进行，工业建设较多的重要城市更应迅速组织力量拟定出城市总体规划草案。
    为进行城市规划，必须对地形、地质、水文、风向等自然资料进行调查、勘测、研究工作。
    城市建设是百年大计的事情，必须根据国家工业建设计划来考虑其可能的发展。即是要根据工业近期建设需要结合发展远景拟定一个既能满足目前需要又能保证长远利益的综合方案。第一期的建设应尽量集中紧凑以节省土地和市政建设投资，同时要为第二期及长远建设留下适当的地方。
    在进行规划时，还应尽量提高旧城市的利用率，必须纠正废弃旧城区完全重建新城区的思想。
    城市建设还应注意艺术形式问题。一个城市，一个建筑群或一个建筑物，不但要为劳动人民提供舒适的生活条件与工作条件，而且应表现一定的艺术性、思想性，体现出社会主义时代的伟大与美丽。目前我们还没有创造出一套成熟的东西。建筑艺术亦如文学、美术、戏剧、音乐一样，需要吸取中外古今各种优良成就，扬弃其反动的不适合于现代中国建筑条件与要求的部分，吸取其进步的适合于中国民族特点的部分来进行创造。城市建筑艺术形式的要求亦须与我国当前的经济技术条件相适应，即亦应有重点的进行。比如永久性纪念性的高大建筑，就必须注意美观壮丽，而一般建筑就不一定要求有很高的艺术性。同时艺术形式的设计必须注意节约的原则，不能为了追求艺术形式而提高造价。
    二、建立城市建设的监督管理制度：几年来，城市建设中的盲目分散现象是与没有统一的监督管理制度分不开的。一个城市里决不止一个修建单位，若各个建筑单位都各行其是，就无法保证城市的整体利益，也就无法保证工业建设的需要。故建立城市建设的监督管理制度，实在是刻不容缓的了，现在许多城市已先后建立了城市建设委员会，有了执行此项制度的机关；不少城市初步规划草图已陆续完成，已给实行监督管理创造了条件和依据。最近召开的全国第一次城市建设会议上又讨论了关于加强城市建筑管理的条例草案，这个条例公布执行以后，这方面的情况将会得到进一步的改善。
    三、加强城市各种公用事业的建设与管理工作：为了直接配合工业建厂任务与生产任务，目前特别要加紧进行各种厂外工程的设计和施工。
    四、拟定必要的城市经济技术定额：城市经济技术定额是城市目前与将来经济生活发展水平的标志，是确定市区规模大小与住宅、公共建筑、绿化、工业、铁道、仓库等合理组织，以及经济合理分配用地的主要依据之一。目前首先应该拟定城市的规划定额，以应城市规划与建设的需要。
    新中国的城市建设任务是艰巨的，也是光荣的。希望各地城市建设工作者和建筑师们共同努力来完成这个任务！
