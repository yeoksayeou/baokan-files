    The Central Sports Commission and other departments jointly issued "Joint Instructions on Promoting Youth Radio Calisthenics in Elementary Schools Nationwide"
    The instructions stated: Young children are the future builders and defenders of the motherland. Cultivating them to have healthy physiques and a lively, brave, and collective spirit is one of our important current tasks. In recent years, thanks to the care of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, sports activities for children nationwide, especially elementary school students, have greatly developed, and their health levels have improved to a certain extent. To enable children across the country to participate more widely in physical exercise to further improve their health, we have developed youth radio calisthenics based on the physiological characteristics of children aged nine to twelve. This set of calisthenics includes movements for all major parts of the body, has an appropriate amount of exercise, and has the function of promoting comprehensive physical development. It can be used as one of the basic methods of physical education teaching in elementary schools and for children to engage in physical exercise. Therefore, we request that this set of calisthenics be promoted in all elementary schools nationwide starting from the first semester of the 1954 academic year.
    To ensure the correct implementation of youth radio calisthenics, the instructions pointed out: 1. Educational administrative departments at all levels and administrative leaders of elementary schools must pay attention to and care about this work, and promote it in elementary schools in a guided and planned manner, combining it with the actual conditions of their respective regions and schools. Educational administrative departments at all levels should use the summer elementary school teacher study sessions or organize separate study sessions for elementary school physical education teachers so that they can organize and guide students in doing the exercises after the start of the school year. Sports commissions at all levels should actively assist the youth radio calisthenics study sessions organized by educational administrative departments. 2. Youth radio calisthenics are pre-class exercises or morning exercises for elementary schools and can also be changed to recess exercises in winter. Pre-class exercises should be conducted collectively by students in grades three to six every morning before class, following the music of youth radio calisthenics. Schools without radio equipment should have teachers use commands instead. After the exercises, students should enter the classroom in formation as much as possible to start the day's study in an organized manner. 3. When elementary school students start learning youth radio calisthenics, it is relatively difficult to do the exercises according to the rhythm of the calisthenics music. The leading teacher must patiently teach them the key points of the movements and the correct postures, preferably demonstrating and explaining at the same time. Only after the students are familiar with the movements should they do the exercises according to the speed of the music. Class teachers and Young Pioneer instructors should educate and supervise the students to ensure that they seriously do this set of radio calisthenics. When students are doing the exercises, principals, teaching directors, and teachers of grades three to six should participate as much as possible to encourage them. 4. Students in grades one and two can temporarily use youth radio calisthenics before unified teaching materials are stipulated. However, they cannot be required to complete each movement like students in grades three to six. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央体育运动委员会等
    联合指示全国小学推行少年广播体操
    中央人民政府体育运动委员会、教育部、卫生部、政务院文化教育委员会广播事业局和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会发出了“关于在全国小学中推行少年广播体操的联合指示”。
    指示说：少年儿童是祖国未来的建设者和保卫者，培养他们具有健康的体质和活泼、勇敢、富有集体主义的精神，是我们当前重要任务之一。几年来，由于中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的关怀，全国少年儿童特别是小学学生的体育运动有很大开展，健康水平已有一定程度的提高。为了使全国少年儿童更广泛地参加体育锻炼，以进一步提高健康水平，我们根据九至十二岁少年儿童的生理特征，编制了少年广播体操。这套体操包括全身各主要部分的动作，有适当的运动量，具备促进身体全面发育的功能，可以作为小学体育教学和少年儿童进行体育锻炼基本方式之一。因此，我们要求从一九五四年度上学期开始在全国各小学中推行这套体操。
    为了保证正确贯彻少年广播体操的工作，指示指出：一、各级教育行政机关、各小学行政领导必须重视和关心这件工作，结合本地区、本校实际情况，有领导有计划地在各小学中推行。各级教育行政机关，应利用暑期的小学教师学习会或另组织小学体育教师进行学习，以便在开学后组织和指导学生做操。各级体委对教育行政机关举办的少年广播体操学习会，应主动予以协助。二、少年广播体操是小学的课前操或早操，冬季也可改为课间操。课前操应在每天早晨上课以前集合三至六年级学生依照少年广播体操的曲子集体进行。没有广播设备的学校，由教师用口令代替。操完后，尽可能让学生列队进入教室，有组织地开始一天的学习。三、小学生在开始学习少年广播操时，依照体操曲子的节拍做操是比较困难的，领操教师必须先将体操的动作要领和正确姿势，耐心地教会他们，最好一面示范，一面说明，等学生动作熟练后，再依照曲子速度做操。班主任和少年先锋队辅导员应对学生进行教育和督促，使学生认真地做好这套广播体操。学生做操时，校长、教导主任和三至六年级的任课教师，尽可能参加以资鼓励。四、一、二年级学生，在没有规定统一教材以前，可暂用少年广播体操。但不能像对三至六年级的学生那样去要求他们完成各个动作。（新华社）
