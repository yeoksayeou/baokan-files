    Anhui Province Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
    Achieve Results in Promoting Supply and Marketing Integration Contracts
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Anhui Province have widely established supply and marketing integration contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. According to incomplete statistics from fifty-one counties alone, there are currently three hundred and six grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and four hundred and thirty-one agricultural production cooperatives, and one thousand and ninety-two mutual aid teams that have signed two thousand one hundred and thirty-five integration contracts.
    Through supply and marketing integration contracts, supply and marketing cooperatives have systematically further met the needs of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams for means of production. During this year's spring plowing season, grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Anqing Special District supplied agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams with more than 330,000 jin of various commodity fertilizers, more than 20,000 jin of seeds, more than 5,000 pieces of agricultural implements, 7 sprayers, and more than 13,000 jin of insecticides, totaling 480 million yuan, based on more than 400 integration contracts, basically meeting the needs of these agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. After the Xu Guochen Mutual Aid Team in Qianshan County signed an integration contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, it was still able to buy 1,700 jin of cake fertilizer despite the shortage of fertilizer, enabling the team's more than 60 mu of rice to grow well. Through the signing of integration contracts, many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have reorganized production according to the national plan. For example, after the Tuqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liu'an County signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, it planted three more mu of oil crops. The planning of the supply and marketing cooperative's business operations has also been strengthened. In the process of signing integration contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, the Xin'an Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Liu'an County understood their needs and revised the supply plan for means of production, adding more than 20 kinds of agricultural implements.
    At present, supply and marketing cooperatives in many areas of Anhui Province are summarizing experiences and further promoting integration contracts. (Jiang Jiesan)

    安徽省各地供销合作社
    推广供销结合合同有成绩
    安徽省各地供销合作社广泛地和农业生产合作社、互助组订立供销结合合同。仅据五十一个县的不完全统计，目前已有三百零六个基层供销合作社和四百三十一个农业生产合作社、一千零九十二个互助组订了二千一百三十五份结合合同。
    通过供销结合合同，供销合作社有计划地进一步满足了农业生产合作社和互助组对生产资料的需要。在今年春耕生产期间，安庆专区基层供销合作社即根据四百多份结合合同，供应给农业生产合作社和互助组各种商品肥料三十三万多斤，种籽二万多斤，农具五千多件，喷雾器七架和杀虫药剂一万三千多斤，总值达四亿八千万元，基本上满足了这些农业生产合作社和互助组的需要。潜山县徐国臣互助组和供销合作社签订结合合同以后，在肥料不足的情况下，仍然能买到饼肥一千七百斤，使该组六十多亩稻子都生长良好。通过签订结合合同，不少农业生产合作社和互助组按照国家计划重新安排了生产。如六安县土桥农业生产合作社和供销合作社签订合同以后，就多种了三亩油料作物。供销合作社业务经营中也加强了计划性。六安县新安供销合作社在和农业生产合作社、互助组签订结合合同的过程中，了解了它们的需要，便修改了生产资料供应计划，增加了二十多种农具。
    目前，安徽省许多地区的供销合作社正在总结经验，进一步推广结合合同。　（蒋杰三）
