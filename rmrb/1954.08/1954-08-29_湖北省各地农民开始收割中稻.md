Farmers in Hubei Province have begun harvesting mid-season rice and are rushing to plant late-autumn crops. Before the harvest, various localities, centered on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, universally educated farmers on the importance of quick harvesting and planting, meticulous harvesting and threshing, and ensuring that every grain is brought home. The Rao Xingli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xishui County, after careful accounting, implemented meticulous harvesting and threshing. It was calculated that this would result in an extra twelve catties of grain per mu. The cooperative's 358 mu of paddy fields could yield more than 4,000 extra catties. The members have great confidence and then formulated specific measures for clean cutting, clean bundling, clean threshing, and clean winnowing, as well as specific plans for cultivating ratooning rice. Farmers in Yidu County did not have the habit of meticulous harvesting and threshing in previous years, resulting in a lot of grain being scattered and wasted. This year, in addition to vigorous publicity and education through careful accounting, the county also used the example of Fukiadian Township in the Second District, which harvested carefully and yielded more grain, to educate the surrounding farmers, with significant results. In order to overcome the difficulties caused by the male labor force going to the dikes for flood control and the lack of manpower for the autumn harvest, Changshan Township in Wuchang County, with the women in the mutual aid and cooperative organizations as the backbone, mobilized and organized the women of the entire township to participate in the autumn harvest, so that the autumn harvest tasks could be completed smoothly.

While harvesting, various localities are also seizing the time to rush plant late-autumn crops. The main focus at present is on cultivating ratooning rice. In four townships, including Chayuan in Zhijiang County, more than 6,300 mu of ratooning rice were cultivated immediately after harvesting more than 6,800 mu of rice. Because many areas lacked experience in cultivating ratooning rice, technical guidance has been strengthened. Dangyang County adopted the method of district-level demonstrations and township-level demonstrations, enabling farmers throughout the county to quickly learn the techniques.

    湖北省各地农民开始收割中稻
    湖北省已开始收割中稻，抢种晚秋作物。各地在收割之前，以互助合作组织为中心，普遍地对农民进行抢收抢种、细收细打、颗粒还家的教育。浠水县饶兴礼农业生产合作社经过算细账，实行细收细打、以每亩田多收十二斤谷计算，该社三百五十八亩稻田、就可多收四千多斤。社员信心很高，接着就订出了割净，捆净、打净、扬净的具体办法和培育再生稻的具体计划。宜都县农民往年没有细收细打的习惯，漏撒很多，今年该县除大力宣传、用算细账的办法进行教育外，还通过二区福家店乡收割仔细、多打粮食的实例，教育周围农民，收到显著效果。武昌县长山乡为了克服男劳动力上堤防汛、无人秋收的困难、就以互助合作组织中的妇女为骨干、发动与组织了全乡妇女投入秋收。使秋收任务也能顺利完成。
    各地在秋收同时，即抓紧时间抢种晚秋作物。目前主要环节是培育再生稻。枝江县茶园等四个乡，在割完六千八百多亩水稻后，即培育了六千三百多亩再生稻，很多地区由于群众缺乏培育再生稻的经验，都加强了技术指导。当阳县采取区区表演，乡乡示范的办法，使全县农民很快地学会了技术。
