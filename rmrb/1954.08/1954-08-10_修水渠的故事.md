The Story of Repairing the Irrigation Canal
　　Zhao Zhongxin

　　I
　　In Manlao Village, Mengzhe District, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, Yunnan Border Region, a story is told. Many years ago, there was a very capable man in Manlao Village named Shi Longfa. Shi Longfa loved his hometown with its evergreen pine forests, his rich land that produced pineapples, bananas, and other subtropical fruits, as well as abundant rice, and he loved his people even more. However, he also deeply felt the suffering brought to himself and his people by natural and man-made disasters. Therefore, he tried every means to benefit his people. In a year of spring drought, Shi Longfa was very anxious seeing that the dry rice fields could not be planted. One day, he discussed with the villagers, saying: Relying on heaven for food is unreliable. If we could divert water from the Nanmuxi Zai River at the foot of Mount Pahan to the plains for irrigation, wouldn't we be able to plant rice? His proposal was supported by the whole village, so they elected him as Zhao Heng (Director), and Shi Longfa enthusiastically led everyone to divert water and dig canals. The kind-hearted Shi Longfa did not expect that doing so would cause dissatisfaction among some people. However, it was this matter that aroused the jealousy of the local ruling class towards him. Suddenly, a shocking incident occurred: Shi Longfa was assassinated.

　　Shi Longfa's death was an extremely painful event for the Dai people of Manlao Village. Some families quietly left the village with grief and indignation, while those who remained sighed with disappointment, saying, "Shi Longfa was killed. Who knows when there will be such a good person to lead us to dig a canal again!"

　　When the Kuomintang reactionaries came, the villages in the Nanqiao Plain suddenly received a notice from the county government, which read: "In order to fulfill the wishes of the local people, this government has decided to dig canals and build channels to develop water conservancy..." When the news reached Manlao Village, everyone was overjoyed and immediately prepared according to the requirements stipulated in the notice: each large village would pay five silver dollars, six chickens, and one pig; each small village would pay five silver dollars and four chickens, quickly preparing everything. On the appointed date, the headmen of each village happily arrived at the Nanqiao County Government one after another, carrying bamboo chicken cages and driving pigs. In an instant, the county government gate was crowded with groups of fat pigs, and chicken cages stretched for half a mile. The white silver dollars filled the desks in the county government office.

　　People who came with grateful hearts and with the sincere wishes of thousands upon thousands of kind Dai people, all wanted to take this rare opportunity to admire the "County Magistrate" who cared about their suffering, and were eager to know the "benevolent" measures of the "County Magistrate" to "benefit the people" and develop water conservancy. At this moment, a person in a black Zhongshan suit appeared. He was Zhang, the county magistrate of Nanqiao County, who carried out reactionary rule here. Immediately, thousands of pairs of expectant eyes focused on the county magistrate. Magistrate Zhang smiled and looked around at the groups of pigs, chickens, and silver dollars, nodded contentedly, and then said to everyone with a majestic air: "Everyone, you have delivered the pigs, chickens, and money on time, very good..." The people listened and nodded to each other with smiles. People were thinking that the county magistrate was happy, so the matter must be done. Who knew that Magistrate Zhang frowned and pretended to be serious, saying: "Everyone, unfortunately, according to the heavens, it is not suitable to start construction this year. If you go against the will of heaven and offend the earth gods, there will be a disaster of darkness and chaos." People were shocked and immediately felt half-hearted. When they looked back in disappointment at the pigs, chickens, and silver dollars they had already handed over, everything was gone. After a burst of remorse and anger, everyone left the Nanqiao County Government dejectedly.

　　The liberated Dai people, under the shining light of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's glorious ethnic policies, established the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region People's Government in January 1953. The Dai people, living in a large family of unity and friendship among all ethnic groups, not only gained equal ethnic rights, but also increasingly improved their economic lives.

　　In February 1953, according to the wishes of the local people, after investigation, surveying, and careful planning, the People's Government allocated 20 million yuan in loans, mobilized and organized 7,000 workers, and spent twenty days to dig a canal from Mount Pahan to the plains. On the day of releasing water to irrigate the fields, the Dai men and women on the Nanqiao Plain put on festive costumes to celebrate the birth of this new canal. They danced and sang:

　　Passed down from generation to generation,
　　Who is it that repaired the Nanmuxi Zai,
　　Our benefactor Chairman Mao,
　　He brought happiness to the Dai people.

　　Spring plowing is coming, and the warm sunshine shines on the lush green pine forests on the hillside, shining on this vast and fertile plain surrounded by mountains. The ridges are filled with clear water, and looking down from the hillside, the square paddies separated by the ridges are like clean glass mirrors placed on the ground. The egrets with snow-white feathers fly around in the blue sky from time to time, forming a beautiful natural picture. The Dai people, who have gained democracy and freedom, began their intense spring plowing in this time.

　　The first season of early rice is promising. Yan Weng, a 50-year-old Dai farmer from Manlao Village, looked at his rice field with strong stalks, thick ears, and full grains, and felt unspeakably happy. He was thinking: Generation after generation! Who doesn't say that this is a good place! But why in such a good place did everyone used to frown, eat less, and wear less! It's not that we Dai people are idle and lazy, and can't endure labor. It's entirely those people in power who killed Shi Longfa, those "County Magistrates" in black Zhongshan suits who tricked us out of our wealth and made it impossible for us to live! He also thought: If Shi Longfa were still alive, seeing that the Dai people had established their own autonomous region people's government under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and seeing that the water from the Nanmuxi Zai River on Mount Pahan had been diverted to irrigate the rice fields on the plains, and that the rice was growing so well, how happy he would be! Whenever Yan Weng recalled the past, his heart was filled with hatred for the old society and love for the new society.

　　The rice is about to fully mature, and the heavy ears of rice bend the stalks, and the harvesters all have smiles on their faces.

　　This year, the 28 households in Manlao Village increased production by 23,000 jin of grain compared to previous years. In previous years, the whole village generally lacked two months of grain. This year, in addition to having enough to eat, there was surplus grain to take to the trade company to exchange for needed salt, cloth, and silk thread for the girls to embroider.

    修水渠的故事
    赵忠信
    一
    在云南边疆西双版纳傣族自治区版纳勐遮的曼老寨，流传着这样一个故事。很多年以前，曼老寨有一个很有能为的人，名叫石龙法。石龙法爱自己四季常青松林茂密的家乡，爱自己盛产菠萝、香蕉等亚热带水果和出产肥美稻谷的富饶土地，更爱自己本族的人民。但是，他也时刻痛切地感受到天灾人祸给予自己和本族人民带来的深重苦难。于是，他就想尽办法来为本族人民造福。在一个春季荒旱的年头，石龙法眼看着干枯的稻田不能插秧，心里十分焦急。一天，他和寨里的人商议说：靠天吃饭，是靠不住的，我们如果能把帕汗山脚下南慕西宰河里的水引到平坝上来浇田，不是就可以插秧了吗。他的提议得到全寨人的赞助，于是，大家举他为招衡（主任），石龙法也就热心地领导大家引水开渠。善良的石龙法没想到自己这样做还会引起什么人的不满，然而，正是这件事引起了当地统治阶级对他的忌恨。突然，一件惊人的事件发生了，石龙法被暗害了。
    石龙法的死，对曼老寨的傣族人民是个极为悲痛的事。有些人家含着悲愤悄悄地离开了这个寨子，留下的人都怀着失望的心情叹息地说：“石龙法被人害了，谁知那世再有那样好的人带咱开河啊！”
    国民党反动派来了，南峤平坝各寨子里忽然接到县政府一个通知，通知上写着：“本政府为满足当地人民愿望，决定开河造渠，兴修水利……”消息传到曼老寨，全寨人听了无不喜出望外，立刻按着通知所规定的：每大寨出五块银元、六只鸡、一口猪；每小寨出五块银元、四只鸡的摊派，迅速备齐。规定的日期到了，各寨头人高高兴兴地提着竹鸡笼，赶着猪，络绎不绝地先后来到了南峤县政府。霎时，县政府门前肥猪成群，鸡笼摆了半里地长，白花花的银元摆满了县衙里的办公桌。
    怀着感激的心情，带着成千成万善良的傣族人民衷心的愿望赶来的人们，都想趁这个难得的机会，瞻仰一下那位关心他们疾苦的“县太爷”，并迫不急待地想知道“县太爷”“造福人群”兴修水利的
  “仁政”措施。正在这时，一个穿着黑色中山服的人出场了，他就是在这儿进行反动统治的南峤县张县长。马上，千百双期待的眼睛一致集中在县长的身上。张县长笑眯眯地环视了一下那成群的猪、鸡和银元，得意地点了点头，而后才神气威严的对大家说：“诸位，你们按时把猪、鸡和款送来了，很好。……”百姓听了，相互点点头笑了笑。人们在想县长高兴，事一定办成了。那知张县长把眉头一皱，装作若有其事的样子说：“诸位，很不幸，按天示意，今年不宜动工，如违天意，触犯了地神，就会发生天昏地暗的灾祸。”人们听了心里一惊，立刻凉了半截，待他们失望地回顾那些已出了手的猪、鸡和银元的时候，一切都不在了。在经过一阵后悔已晚的愤懑的骚乱之后，个个都垂头丧气地离开了南峤县政府。
    二解放了的傣族人民，在共产党和毛主席光辉的民族政策照耀下，于一九五三年一月成立了西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府。生活在各民族团结友爱大家庭的傣族人民，不仅获得了平等的民族权利，在经济生活上也日益得到了改善。
    一九五三年二月，人民政府根据当地人民的愿望，经过调查勘测和周密筹划，拨了两千万元的贷款，动员组织了七千个人工，用了二十天时间，就从帕汗山到平坝开出了一条水渠。在放水浇田的那天，南峤平坝上的傣族男女穿上节日的盛装，来为这条新渠的诞生祝贺。他们舞着唱着：
    祖祖辈辈传下来哟，
    那一个修好了南慕西宰，
    我们的恩人毛主席啊，
    他给傣族带了幸福来。
    春耕来临了，和煦的阳光普照着山坡上茂密翠绿的松林，普照着这块为群山环绕的辽阔肥沃的平坝子。田畦里灌满了清澈的水，从山坡上向下望去，那由田埂分开的一块块方形的水田，就像一块块洁净的玻璃镜摆在地面上似的。那披着雪白羽毛的鹭鸶鸟，不时在蔚蓝色的天空四处飞翔，构成了一幅挺秀的自然图画。获得民主自由的傣族人民，就在这个时光，开始了他们紧张的春耕生产。
  三第一季早稻丰收在望了。曼老寨五十岁的傣族老农岩翁。看着他那秆壮穗粗谷粒饱满的稻田，心里有说不出来的高兴。他在想：世世代代呀！谁不说我们这里是个好地方啊！可是过去为什么在这样好的地方一个个还愁眉苦脸少吃没穿的呢！不是我们傣族人游手好闲，不耐劳动，这完全是那些杀害石龙法的当权的人，那些穿着黑色中山服骗我们财物的“县太爷”摆治得我们没法生活啊！他还想：要是石龙法现在还活着，看见本族人在毛主席领导下成立了自己的自治区人民政府，看到帕汗山的南慕西宰河里水已被引来浇灌平坝上的稻田，并且稻子长的这样好，他该多么高兴啊！每逢岩翁回忆起往事来，都从内心里充满对旧社会的憎恨和对新社会的喜爱。
    稻子就要完全成熟了，沉甸甸的稻穗把禾杆压得弯着腰，收割的人们个个面含微笑。
    这年，曼老寨二十八户人家，比往年增产两万三千斤谷。往年全寨普遍缺两个月的粮，今年除够吃外，还有余粮拿到贸易公司去换回需要的盐巴、布匹和姑娘们绣花用的丝线等物品。
