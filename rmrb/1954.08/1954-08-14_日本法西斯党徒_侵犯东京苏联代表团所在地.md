Xinhua News Agency, August 13th, TASS dispatch from August 12th: On August 9th, the Tokyo Soviet delegation premises were invaded by thugs from the Japanese fascist "Patriotic Party."

It is now known that many journalists, photographers, and police officers appeared near the Soviet delegation's residence at about noon on August 9th. Subsequently, approximately two hundred agitators carrying anti-Soviet slogans arrived by car. The police stood by and watched as these troublemakers forced open the iron gate and stormed into the courtyard of the delegation's residence. These troublemakers even attempted to smash down the main building's door. After plastering anti-Soviet slogans on the iron gate, the walls of the main building, and the trees in the delegation's courtyard, the instigators of this disturbance organized a rally in the courtyard.

A Japanese police unit soon arrived in the area of the Soviet delegation, but did not stop the troublemakers' disturbance. This disturbance lasted for an hour and a half. During this time, a police car stationed at the iron gate of the delegation residence issued instructions via loudspeaker. Among these police officers was an American intelligence official. Around 6:00 PM, the troublemakers left the area of the Soviet delegation, as if on command.

These facts show that the invasion of the Tokyo Soviet delegation was a pre-arranged provocative action. Two weeks prior, the fascist "Patriotic Party" plastered anti-Soviet slogans throughout the city, demanding that August 9th be declared "Anti-Soviet" Day. On August 6th, the "Japan Times" published an article about the upcoming rally, pointing out that the rally would be held near the Soviet delegation's premises.

### 日本法西斯党徒  侵犯东京苏联代表团所在地

    日本法西斯党徒
    侵犯东京苏联代表团所在地
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社十二日讯：八月九日，东京苏联代表团所在地受到日本法西斯“爱国党”党徒的侵犯。
    现在已经知道，许多新闻记者、摄影记者和警察曾在八月九日差不多正午的时候在苏联代表团住址附近出现。接着，两百名左右携带反苏标语的煽动分子便乘车到达。警察却眼看这些捣乱分子冲开铁门，涌进代表团住址的院子。这些捣乱分子还企图捣毁代表团的主要建筑物的大门。这次捣乱的主使人在铁门、主要建筑物的墙上和代表团住址院子里的树上都贴上了反苏标语后，就在院子里组织了一次集会。
    一支日本警察队不久便到达苏联代表团所在地区，但是并未阻止捣乱分子的捣乱。这种捣乱进行了一小时半。在这个时候一直停留在代表团住址铁门口的一辆警备车从广播中发出指示。这些警察内有一名美国情报官员。约在十八时左右，捣乱分子离开了苏联代表团所在地区，好像接到命令似的。
    从这些事实中可以看出，侵犯东京苏联代表团是预先布置好的挑衅行动。在两星期前，法西斯“爱国党”在全城张贴反苏标语，要求宣布八月九日为“反苏”日。八月六日，“日本时报”刊登了一篇关于即将举行的集会的文章，指出这个集会将在苏联代表团所在地附近举行。
