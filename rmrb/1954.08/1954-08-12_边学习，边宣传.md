    Learning and Propagating Simultaneously
    Guan Yanfu, Wang Guihao, Chen Weifang
    Under the leadership of the Party branch of Dazhuang Township, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, more than 40 educated youths enthusiastically participated in the propaganda of the draft constitution.
    Some of them had just graduated from elementary school and returned to their hometown, while others were junior high school and normal school students home for summer vacation. When they learned that the Party branch had decided to organize all the educated youths in the township to study the draft constitution and assist the Party's propagandists in widely launching propaganda activities for the draft constitution among the masses, everyone was very happy. Eleven young students from Gaojiawu Village and Zhangjia Village took the initiative to contact village cadres and mutual aid team leaders, and actively participated in the study of the draft constitution in the village under the unified leadership of the township, and went to various mutual aid teams to help publicize the draft constitution. Wang Guoxian, Zhang Hongren and others were eloquent and had loud voices. Every morning and evening, they took loudspeakers and went to the villages to promote it; Gao Zhisong, Pang Baoxuan and others wrote many slogans to promote the draft constitution and posted the slogans throughout the village. With the participation of educated youths in the propaganda work, the content of the village's blackboard newspaper has also been enriched. The news of propaganda activities written in red and green colored chalk makes the villagers more eager to read. As Shen Wuting, the mutual aid team leader of Zhangjia Village, said: "Now the blackboard newspaper in the village is written clearly and beautifully, and the content is good." Whenever the young students are free, they go to "visit families" to publicize the draft constitution to the old grandfathers and grandmothers who usually do not attend meetings. While publicizing, everyone compares the past and talks about the future, and the elderly people love to listen. Grandma Lisheng, who is over sixty years old in Zhangjia Village, said: "If you hadn't come to tell me about it, I wouldn't know what a draft constitution is."
    In order to make the propaganda content more substantial, the youths conduct collective study every other day. They proposed: learning while improving, and propagating simultaneously. Therefore, every time they propagandize, they will not "regurgitate old ideas". The twenty-four educated youths in Wang Village also established three groups: blackboard newspaper, local broadcasting, and skit troupe, and carried out their work separately. They have become capable assistants in various mutual aid teams, and the team's reading and discussion of the draft constitution cannot do without their help and participation. Mutual aid team leader Wang Weibao said: "Elementary school graduates have really become secretaries in our mutual aid team." Recently, the skit troupe of Wang Village also performed two cross-talk skits to promote the draft constitution. At noon and in the evening, when the farmers were resting, they beat gongs and drums and toured the village, which was welcomed by the villagers.
    Through such organized study and propaganda of the draft constitution, the youths have also made great progress. Many people had not studied the draft constitution well in the past, but now they have not only studied it, but also can tell the basic spirit of the draft constitution. At the same time, the educated youths have also better access to agricultural production and participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. For example, Pang Baoxuan, an elementary school graduate, originally thought that participating in agricultural production had no future, but when she learned about the bright future of socialist transformation of agriculture and the specific path of transformation from the draft constitution propaganda, she took the initiative to request to join the Gao Bolin mutual aid team. She said: "If I can't get into junior high school, I will definitely participate in agricultural production with peace of mind, and use the culture I have learned in the socialist transformation of agriculture." Wang Guansheng did not like to read political theory books in school, but after participating in the draft constitution propaganda this time, he also often reads newspapers and related articles in "China Youth". He said: "Now I have seen the taste of books and newspapers. Whenever I have time, I always want to read books and magazines." Zhang Hanxiong and Zhang Youwen were not very talkative people in school, but now, when they publicize, they not only do not blush, but also have been trained to be experienced. Everyone deeply understands that learning in actual work is of great education to them, and they can learn a lot of new knowledge. The educated youths in Gaojiawu Village and Zhangjia Village plan to organize amateur study groups for a long time in the future, persist in learning in production and work, and better produce and work in learning, in order to serve the socialist construction of the motherland with practical actions.

    边学习，边宣传
    管彦福　王贵灏　陈渭方
    浙江省萧山县大庄乡四十多个知识青年在该乡党支部的领导下，热烈地参加了宪法草案宣传。
    他们中间有的是刚从小学里毕业回乡的，有的是初中、简师的学生，回家渡暑假的。当他们知道党支部决定组织全乡的知识青年学习宪法草案、协助党的宣传员向群众广泛展开宪法草案的宣传活动时，大家都十分高兴。高家坞村和张家村的十一个青年学生就主动去和村干部、互助组组长联系，在乡的统一领导下积极参加村里的宪法草案学习，并分头深入到各个互助组里去帮助宣传宪法草案。王国贤、张洪仁等几个人口才好，喉咙又响，每天清早和傍晚拿着广播筒分头在村里宣传；高志松、庞宝宣等几个人写了许多宣传宪法草案的标语，把标语贴遍了全村。有了知识青年参加宣传工作，村里黑板报的内容也丰富起来了，用红、绿彩色粉笔抄写的宣传活动消息，使得村里的群众更爱看了。正如张家村的互助组长沈五庭说：“现在村里的黑板报写得又清楚又漂亮，内容又好。”青年学生们一空下来就去“串人家”，向平时不大参加会议的老公公、老婆婆宣传宪法草案。大家一面宣传，一面比比过去，讲讲将来，老年人都非常爱听。张家村六十多岁的利生婆婆说：“你们不来对我讲讲，我还不晓得什么叫做宪法草案哩。”
    为了使宣传内容更加充实，青年们每隔一天进行一次集体学习。他们提出：边学习，边提高，边宣传。所以他们每次宣传起来，都不会老一套地
  “炒冷饭”。王村的二十四个知识青年还成立了黑板报、土广播、活报等三个小组，分头进行工作。他们已经成为各个互助组里得力的助手，组里读报、讨论宪法草案都少不了他们的帮助和参加。互助组长王维宝说：“高小毕业生，真是成了我们互助组里的秘书了。”最近，王村的活报小组还演出了两个宣传宪法草案的对口相声，在中午和傍晚，当农民休息的时候，敲锣打鼓，在村里巡回演出，受到全村群众的欢迎。
    青年们通过这样有组织的学习和宣传宪法草案，自己也有了很大的进步。很多人过去在学校里没有好好地学习过宪法草案，现在不但学了，而且都能讲得出宪法草案的基本精神来。同时，知识青年们也更好地接触到了农业生产，参加到互助合作组织中间去。如高小毕业生庞宝宣原来以为参加农业生产没有什么前途，可是当她从宪法草案宣传中了解到农业社会主义改造的光明前途和改造的具体道路以后，她就主动要求参加高伯林互助组，她说：“我如果考不进初中，保证安心地参加农业生产，把我学到的文化，都用到农业的社会主义改造事业中去。”王观生在学校里不喜欢看政治理论书，可是这次参加了宪法草案宣传以后，他也经常阅读报纸和“中国青年”上的有关文章了，他说：“现在我对书报已经看出味道来了，一有空，总想去看看书报杂志。”张汉熊、张幼文本来在学校里都是不大会说话的人，现在，宣传起来不但不红脸，而且还锻炼得老练了。大家都深深体会到在实际工作中学习，对自己的教育很大，能够学习到的新知识很多。高家坞村与张家村参加农业生产的知识青年，计划今后长期组织业余学习小组，在生产中、工作中坚持学习，在学习中更好地生产、工作，以实际行动来为祖国的社会主义建设服务。
