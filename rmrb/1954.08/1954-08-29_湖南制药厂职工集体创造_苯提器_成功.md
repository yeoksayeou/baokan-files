The employees of the local state-owned Hunan Pharmaceutical Factory have collectively created a "benzene extractor" with great success, greatly simplifying the caffeine extraction process. It is estimated that this will increase production and save the country over 16 billion yuan within a year.

Caffeine is one of the main products of the Hunan Pharmaceutical Factory. It is a drug extracted from tea that has stimulating and cardiotonic effects. During extraction, the tea must first be boiled into a concentrated solution and the impurities removed before further processing. In the past, the factory used sulfuric acid and lime milk as precipitants to remove impurities. This precipitant could not completely precipitate the impurities, and a lot of caffeine was carried away during filtration (about 20% to 40%). At the same time, many complicated procedures were required after precipitation and filtration to make high-quality products. The entire production process took half a month, the output was too low, and the cost was very high.

In order to solve the difficulties in caffeine production and improve the yield rate, the factory's technical personnel held a heated discussion. Technician Liu Liangyan believed that only by removing the impurities in the solution could the yield rate be improved. Based on this opinion, pharmacist Chen Haoran decided to find a new solvent to replace the original precipitant to extract caffeine. Chen Haoran tested every solvent in the laboratory and finally found that benzene was the best solvent. He also found a theoretical basis for this in the Soviet Pharmacopoeia, and discovered that the solubility of caffeine in benzene was just right for their needs.

With the help and encouragement of leading cadres and other pharmacists, pharmacist Chen Haoran actively studied various related materials and designed a set of "benzene extractor" models. After five major revisions, the experiment was finally successful. Experiments have proved that using benzene to extract caffeine can remove impurities more cleanly and improve the yield rate. At the same time, since only one process of benzene extraction is required to remove impurities, the many complex procedures that were previously necessary during impurity removal, such as adding acid and alkali, two evaporations, and two pressure filtrations, can all be eliminated, reducing the caffeine extraction time to only half of what it used to be. Therefore, the factory officially used benzene extraction equipment to produce caffeine in large quantities.

After the "benzene extractor" was officially put into use, the factory's employees gave full play to their innovative spirit and made many improvements and supplements. The caffeine output has been increasing day by day. As of July, they have used the "benzene extractor" for five months of production, and the output has increased five times compared to before. The annual output of caffeine can be increased by more than 10,000 kilograms. At the same time, the yield rate has also been improved. In the past, only 1.2 kilograms of caffeine could be extracted from every 100 kilograms of tea, but now 2.3 kilograms can be extracted, which can save more than 6,900 dan of tea every year. The cost has also been reduced by half compared to the past.

### 湖南制药厂职工集体创造“苯提器”成功

    湖南制药厂职工集体创造“苯提器”成功
    地方国营湖南制药厂职工集体创造“苯提器”成功，大大简化了咖啡因的提取过程，预计一年内能为国家增产节约一百六十余亿元。
    咖啡因是湖南制药厂的主要产品之一，它是从茶叶中提取的一种具有兴奋和强心作用的药品。提取时，要首先将茶叶煮成浓液，除去里面的杂质，然后再继续加工。过去该厂除杂质采用的沉淀剂是硫酸和石灰乳。这种沉淀剂不能使杂质完全沉淀，过滤时带走的咖啡因很多（约百分之二十至四十）；同时，沉淀过滤后又要经过许多繁杂的手续，才能制成精品，整个生产过程需半个月的时间，产量太低，成本很高。
    为解决咖啡因制造中的困难，提高成品率，该厂技术人员们开会进行了热烈的讨论。技术员刘良彦认为只有除尽溶液里的杂质，才能提高成品率。根据这个意见，药师陈浩然决定要找出一种新的溶解剂，代替原来的沉淀剂提取咖啡因。陈浩然将化验室里所有的溶剂每种都做了一次试验，终于发现了苯是最好的溶剂。他又从苏联药典上找到了理论上的根据，并发现咖啡因在苯里的溶解度正适合他们的需要。
    在领导干部和其他药师们的帮助与鼓励下，陈浩然药师又积极钻研各种有关资料，设计了一套
  “苯提器”模型，经过五次重大的修改，终于试验成功。试验证明，用苯提炼咖啡因，可以把杂质去得更干净，使成品率提高；同时，因为只要经过苯提这一道工序就可除去杂质，所以以前在除杂质时必须的加酸加碱、两次蒸发、两次压滤等许多复杂的手续就都可以省去，使咖啡因的提取时间仅及过去所需时间的一半。于是该厂正式使用苯提设备大量生产咖啡因。
    该厂职工在“苯提器”正式应用后，发挥了革新精神，又做了许多改进和补充，咖啡因产量日渐上升，截至七月份止，他们已用“苯提器”进行了五个月的生产，产量较以前增加了五倍，全年可增产咖啡因一万余公斤；同时还提高了成品率，过去每百公斤茶叶只能提取咖啡因一点二公斤，目前已能提取二点三公斤，每年可因此节省茶叶六千九百余担；成本也比过去降低一半。
