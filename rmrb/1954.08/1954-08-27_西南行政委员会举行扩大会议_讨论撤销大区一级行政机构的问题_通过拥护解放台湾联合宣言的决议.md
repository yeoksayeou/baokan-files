Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 25th: The Southwest Administrative Committee held an enlarged meeting from August 23rd to 24th to discuss the implementation of the "Decision of the Central People's Government on Abolishing Greater Administrative Regions and Merging Several Provinces and Municipalities."

The meeting heard Wang Weizhou, Vice Chairman of the Southwest Administrative Committee, read the "Decision of the Central People's Government on Abolishing Greater Administrative Regions and Merging Several Provinces and Municipalities" and Song Renqiong, Vice Chairman of the Southwest Administrative Committee, deliver a report on behalf of the Southwest Administrative Committee on "Implementing the Central Government's Decision on Abolishing Greater Administrative Regions." In his report, Song Renqiong pointed out: Over the past four years, under the correct leadership of the CCP Central Committee and the Central People's Government, with the efforts of people of all ethnic groups and all state organ workers, with the active participation of the People's Liberation Army, and with the participation and support of democratic parties and people's organizations, the Southwest region has done a great deal of work and achieved remarkable results. In particular, since the general line of the state during the transition period was put forward, the enthusiasm of the broad masses has been greatly stimulated and their socialist consciousness has been enhanced, thus the Southwest administrative organs have victoriously completed their historical mission. Song Renqiong said in his report: It is necessary to educate all state organ workers to continue to be responsible with a spirit of being responsible to the country and the people, actively do their original work, do a good job of handover, work with peace of mind, and await assignment. All departments must make every effort to help the central departments and relevant provincial departments with the connection work. Regarding personnel arrangements, we must strive to be appropriate.

Everyone unanimously agreed in their speeches that the central government's decision on abolishing greater administrative regions and merging several provinces and municipalities is a correct measure to further strengthen the centralized leadership of the central government during the period of the state's planned economic construction, and is completely correct, necessary, and timely. Everyone unanimously expressed their full support and firm implementation, and guaranteed the smooth completion of the handover work. In their speeches, everyone expressed their warm support for the joint declaration of the democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China for the liberation of Taiwan, and were determined to do all their work well, actively support the People's Liberation Army, and strive to liberate Taiwan to the end.

The meeting finally passed a resolution on supporting the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, a resolution on supporting the Central People's Government's "Decision on Abolishing Greater Administrative Regions and Merging Several Provinces and Municipalities," and a resolution on supporting the liberation of Taiwan.
