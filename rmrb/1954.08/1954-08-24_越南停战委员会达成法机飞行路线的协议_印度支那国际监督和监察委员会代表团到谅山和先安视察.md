Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd—According to the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, August 21st: The delegations of the two general headquarters of the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Committee reached an agreement on August 20th stipulating the flight routes for French transport aircraft.

In accordance with the Geneva Conference agreements, French aircraft are generally not permitted to fly over areas controlled by the Vietnam People's Army. Therefore, French transport aircraft flying from North Vietnam to South Vietnam must follow certain routes stipulated by both parties. In some areas, aircraft must fly over liberated zones, but French aircraft must fly at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above the ground. As for fighter planes flying to Central and South Vietnam, they must also follow the same flight routes.

The aforementioned agreement is the fourth agreement reached since the meetings of the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Committee began on August 13th.

The delegation went there to inspect the airports, housing, offices, and other facilities necessary for the two fixed teams established by the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Indochina to carry out their work in these two locations.

The delegation was warmly received by the local people's government. After inspecting the airports, housing, and offices, the delegation expressed great satisfaction with the preparatory work of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army and thanked the Vietnam People's Army and the people for their enthusiastic assistance to the commission.

    越南停战委员会达成法机飞行路线的协议
    印度支那国际监督和监察委员会代表团到谅山和先安视察
    【新华社二十二日讯】　据越南通讯社北越二十一日讯：越南中央联合停战委员会双方总司令部代表团在八月二十日达成一项规定法方运输机飞行路线的协议。
    按照日内瓦会议的协定，法方飞机一般不准飞越越南人民军所控制的地区，因而从北越飞向南越去的法方运输机必须遵循着双方协议所规定的一些路线飞行。在有些地方，飞机要飞过解放区，但法方飞机必须要在距地面两千公尺以上的天空飞行。至于飞往中越和南越去的战斗机，也必须遵循同样的飞行路线飞行。
    上述协议是从八月十三日以来越南中央联合停战委员会会议所达成的第四项协议。
    【新华社二十二日讯】　据越南通讯社北越二十一日讯：由印度、加拿大和波兰各派高级军官一人组成的印度支那国际监督和监察委员会的一个代表团八月十九日在越南人民军人员的引导下自委员会的新办公地点富流飞往越中边界的谅山和先安。代表团到那里去是为了视察印度支那国际监督和监察委员会在这两个地点设立的两个固定小组进行工作所必需的机场、房屋、办公处以及其他设施。
    代表团受到当地人民政府的热情招待。代表团在参观了机场、房屋和办公处后，对越南人民军总司令部的准备工作表示十分满意，并感谢越南人民军和人民对委员会的热心帮助。代表团在八月十九日晚飞回富流。
