      [This Newspaper] (讯)The first session of the First People's Congress of Hebei Province was held in Baoding from August 1st to August 8th. A total of 568 representatives attended the meeting.
    At the meeting, Ma Guorui, Second Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, gave an explanation to all representatives on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. All representatives had a warm discussion on the draft constitution, unanimously expressed their support for the draft constitution and their determination to implement it, and made a resolution to support the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.
    The meeting carefully reviewed the report made by Lin Tie, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, on the general situation of the government's work in the past five years and the current main tasks. The representatives unanimously agreed with the current tasks proposed in the report and put forward many constructive suggestions. People's representatives from rural areas all stated that they would mobilize farmers to strengthen flood prevention and drainage, strengthen field management of crops, prune and top cotton in a timely manner, vigorously accumulate fertilizer, and strive to increase production and complete or over fulfill the annual agricultural production plan. In the discussion, the representatives also raised criticisms about certain shortcomings in the government's work. The meeting finally made a resolution, unanimously approving the government's work report.
    The representatives from various places brought a total of more than 2,200 proposals, all of which were reviewed by the congress; among them, more than 1,160 constructive proposals related to various construction issues in the province will be submitted to relevant departments or the governments of relevant regions for handling, incorporated into plans, or used to mobilize the masses to gradually implement them.
    The meeting elected 52 deputies from Hebei Province to the National People's Congress meeting by means of secret ballot.

    Xinhua News Agency, Ya'an, August 10th: The first session of the First People's Congress of Xikang Province was held from August 1st to August 7th. A total of 107 representatives of Han, Yi, Tibetan, Hui, Mongolian, Lisu and other nationalities attended the meeting. They came from the Kangzang Plateau, the Daliang Mountains, and the hot Jinsha River Basin, representing the common will of all ethnic groups.
    At the meeting, the representatives listened to the government work report made by Liao Zhigao, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, and conducted a serious review and discussion. In their speeches and discussions, the representatives used their own personal experiences to prove the great achievements of various tasks in Xikang Province over the past four years. Before liberation, Xikang Province was a province with disunity among ethnic groups, opium everywhere, and rampant bandits. Over the past four years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, discrimination and oppression among ethnic groups no longer exists, and production has developed rapidly. By 1953, regional autonomy had been fully implemented in all areas where ethnic minorities lived in the province. In the past two years, the People's Government has distributed more than 400,000 pieces of agricultural tools, helping people of all ethnic groups change their "slash-and-burn" farming methods. In 1953, the total grain output of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province increased by more than 28 percent compared to 1951. In Han areas, more than 190,000 peasant households have been organized, accounting for more than 49 percent of the total number of peasant households in Han areas. In the past, the plateau and mountainous areas formed by the Hengduan Mountains made transportation extremely inconvenient throughout the province. Over the past four years, more than 7,800 li of post roads and cart roads have been built in these areas. Now, four highways connect various places inside and outside the province, strengthening economic ties inside and outside the province. The representatives unanimously believed that the government work report was in line with the general tasks of the country's transition period and the actual situation of all ethnic groups in Xikang; and unanimously agreed with the review and criticism of the shortcomings and errors in the report. The meeting passed the government work report and approved the work plan for 1954.
    The representatives of all ethnic groups discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China with infinite excitement. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution to support the draft constitution; and decided that in the future, it will continue to carry out propaganda and discussion activities more deeply and widely among the people of the province.
    In accordance with the provisions of the election law, the meeting solemnly conducted the election of deputies to the National People's Congress. The 14 candidates jointly proposed by the Xikang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, local organizations of various democratic parties, people's organizations and relevant parties were unanimously supported by the representatives and were all elected. The elected deputies to the National People's Congress are: Liao Zhigao, Zhang Weijiong, Zhang Rong (all Han nationality), Guoji Mugu, Wazha Muji, Wang Haimin, Ahou Lumu Zi, An Dengyin, Wu Wencai (all Yi nationality), Xia Ke Daodeng, Awang Jiacuo, Jiangyang Bomu (female), Pingcuo Wangjie, Lin Jiayong (all Tibetan nationality).

    各族代表们以无限兴奋的心情讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案。会议一致通过拥护宪法草案的决议；并决定今后将继续在全省人民中更深入广泛地开展宣传和讨论活动。
    会议按照选举法的规定，庄严地进行了全国人民代表大会代表的选举。由中共西康省委员会、各民主党派地方组织和人民团体及有关方面联合提出的十四名候选人受到代表们的一致拥护，全部当选。当选为全国人民代表大会代表的有：廖志高、张为炯、张荣（以上汉族）、果基木古、瓦渣木基、王海民、阿侯鲁木子、安登银、伍文才（以上彝族）、夏克刀登、阿旺嘉错、降央伯姆（女）、平错汪阶、林甲镛（以上藏族）。
