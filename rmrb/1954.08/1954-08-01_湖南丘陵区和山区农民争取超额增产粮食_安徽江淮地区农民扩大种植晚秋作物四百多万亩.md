Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 31st: Farmers in the vast hilly and mountainous areas of Hunan Province are working hard to exceed the planned increase of 1.5 billion jin of grain this year. Early rice in the middle reaches of the Xiang River has been harvested, and farmers are busy transplanting late rice, and some are also carrying out inter-tillage and topdressing in the late rice fields. Newly planted crops such as soybeans, corn, sesame, and sweet potatoes have begun to germinate and grow leaves. Farmers in fourteen counties, including Linli, Dongkou, Shaodong, Anren, Qiyang, have accumulated more than 16.3 million dan of fertilizer in the past week, universally topdressed more than 280,000 mu of middle rice fields, sown miscellaneous grain crops on nearly 30,000 mu of dry land, reclaimed more than 6,370 mu of barren land, and cleared weeds from the edges of nearly 100,000 mu of rice fields, actively eliminating pests. Many villages, led by mutual aid and cooperative organizations, have enthusiastically launched production competitions.

In addition to strengthening field management of existing crops, farmers in the hilly and mountainous areas of Hunan Province have also made use of favorable conditions such as fertile land, warm climate, and abundant rainfall to appropriately expand the area for cultivating ratooning rice and planting late rice and miscellaneous grain crops. To ensure sufficient water for these crops, farmers in many areas have paid attention to improving water conservancy and irrigation systems. According to incomplete statistics from fifteen counties in Shaoyang, Xiangtan and other special districts, more than 14,000 farmland water conservancy projects have been rushed to completion recently, irrigating tens of thousands of mu of rice fields. In 324 townships in Rucheng, Chenxian, Guiyang, Lanshan and other counties, more than 1,700 ponds and dams have established a dedicated water management system with mutual aid and cooperative organizations as the core, which generally improves drought resistance by ten days.
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 31st: Farmers in the Jianghuai area of Anhui Province (Anqing, Wuhu, Luan, Chuxian and other special districts) are expanding the planting of late autumn crops by more than 4 million mu, striving to increase production by more than 400 million jin of grain.

After some farmland in the Jianghuai area was flooded, local farmers, in addition to vigorously draining water and replanting, are also actively reclaiming vacant land and cultivating the original "idle land" (land with one crop a year or three crops in two years) under the slogan of "planting more and harvesting more," as well as reclaiming some mountainous areas under the principle of not hindering soil and water conservation in mountainous areas, planting late autumn crops such as potatoes, buckwheat, and carrots. The state-owned Xuanlangguang Mechanized Farm dispatched eight tractors to help surrounding farmers reclaim 15,000 mu of vacant land, of which 4,000 mu have been plowed and harrowed and are starting to be sown. The Zheng Bifa Agricultural Production Cooperative and three mutual aid groups, including Yang Mingde, in Xuancheng County have expanded the cultivated area by more than 130 mu. More than 10,000 cadres from Anhui provincial-level organizations in Hefei City are also reclaiming and utilizing 1,000 mu of vacant land, striving to produce 100,000 jin of grain to support the people in the disaster areas.

In the process of expanding the cultivated area in the Jianghuai area, special organizations to lead this work have been established in each special district, county, district, and township. Agricultural and food departments at all levels are supplying farmers with a large number of late autumn crop seeds. Supply and marketing cooperatives are also supplying farmers with a large number of farm tools. The Anqing Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative alone has supplied more than 2,400 farm tools such as hoes, harrows, and machetes.

    湖南丘陵区和山区农民争取超额增产粮食
    安徽江淮地区农民扩大种植晚秋作物四百多万亩
   【新华社长沙三十一日电】湖南省广大丘陵区和山区的农民，正在为今年超额增产十五亿斤粮食而紧张地劳动。湘江中游地区的早稻已经收割，农民忙着栽插晚稻，有的并在间作晚稻田里进行中耕和追肥。新近种植的黄豆、玉米、芝麻、红薯等作物，有些已开始发芽长叶。临澧、洞口、邵东、安仁、祁阳等十四个县的农民，近一周来共积聚肥料一千六百三十多万担，在二十八万多亩中稻田里普遍追肥一次，在近三万亩旱地上播种杂粮作物，还开垦熟荒六千三百七十多亩，铲除近十万亩稻田的田边杂草，积极扑灭害虫。许多乡村在互助合作组织带头下热烈地展开了生产竞赛。
    湖南省丘陵区和山区各地农民除加强现有农作物的田间管理外，还利用土地肥沃、气候温暖、雨量充足的有利条件，适当地扩大了培育再生稻和种植晚稻、杂粮作物的面积。为了保证这些作物有足够的水源，许多地区的农民都注意整理水利灌溉系统。据邵阳、湘潭等专区的十五个县不完全统计，最近突击修好了一万四千多处农田水利工程，使数万亩稻田得到灌溉。在汝城、郴县、桂阳、蓝山等县的三百二十四个乡里，已有一千七百多处塘坝建立起以互助合作组织为核心的专人管理用水制度，一般能提高抗旱能力十天。
   【新华社合肥三十一日电】安徽省江淮地区（安庆、芜湖、六安、滁县等专区）的农民正在扩大种植晚秋作物四百多万亩，争取增产四亿多斤粮食。
    江淮地区部分农田受涝后，当地农民除大力进行排涝补种外，并在“多种多收”的口号下，积极开垦空白地和耕翻原来的“休闲地”（一年一季或两年三季的土地），以及在不妨碍山区水土保持的原则下开垦部分山地，种植马铃薯、荞麦、胡萝卜等晚秋作物。国营宣郎广机耕农场出动八部拖拉机，帮助周围农民开垦空白地一万五千亩，现在已有四千亩耕耙完毕，开始播种。宣城县郑必发农业生产合作社和杨明德等三个互助组已扩大耕种面积一百三十多亩。合肥市一万多个安徽省直属机关的干部，也正在开垦和利用空地一千亩，争取生产十万斤粮食支援灾区人民。
    江淮地区扩大耕种面积的过程中，每个专区、县、区、乡都建立了领导这一工作的专门机构。各级农业和粮食部门供应农民大批晚秋作物的种籽。供销合作社系统也供应农民大量农具。单是安庆专区供销合作社就已供应二千四百多件锄、钯、砍刀等农具。
