Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 26th: The Xinjiang Provincial People's Government South Xinjiang Administrative Office was officially established on August 21st in Kashgar, the central city of Southern Xinjiang. More than 6,000 cadres from various agencies and people of all ethnic groups in Kashgar held a celebration rally. Lü Jianren, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Ibrahim Tudi, Director of the People's Supervision Committee of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, attended the meeting to congratulate on behalf of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government respectively. At the meeting, Iminov Mamat, Director of the South Xinjiang Administrative Office, reported on the major achievements in various construction undertakings in the South Xinjiang region since liberation.

The South Xinjiang Administrative Office governs four special districts: Aksu, Kashgar, Shache, and Hotan, and the Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Region, with a total of 31 counties and cities and more than 3 million people. The Tianshan Mountains divide Xinjiang Province into northern and southern parts. Urumqi City, where the Provincial People's Government is located, is more than 1,600 kilometers away from Kashgar, the center of southern Xinjiang. A round trip by car takes about 20 days, making contact very inconvenient. The approval by the State Council of the Central People's Government to establish the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government representative agency—the South Xinjiang Administrative Office—in South Xinjiang will further promote the construction undertakings of the people of all ethnic groups in South Xinjiang.

    新疆省人民政府南疆行政公署成立
    【新华社乌鲁木齐二十六日电】新疆省人民政府南疆行政公署八月二十一日在南疆中心城市喀什市正式成立。喀什市各机关干部、各族人民六千多人举行了庆祝大会。中共中央新疆分局统一战线工作部部长吕剑人、新疆省人民政府人民监察委员会主任伊不拉音吐的，分别代表中共中央新疆分局、新疆省人民政府到会祝贺。会上，南疆行政公署主任伊敏诺夫买买提报告了南疆地区解放后各项建设事业的重大成就。
    南疆行政公署辖阿克苏、喀什、莎车、和阗四个专区和克兹勒苏柯尔克兹族自治区，共三十一个县、市，三百多万人口。天山山脉把新疆省分成了南北两部，省人民政府所在地乌鲁木齐市距离南疆的中心喀什市达一千六百多公里，汽车往返一次，需时二十天左右，联系十分不便。中央人民政府政务院批准在南疆成立新疆省人民政府代表机构——南疆行政公署，将使南疆各族人民的建设事业得到进一步发展。
