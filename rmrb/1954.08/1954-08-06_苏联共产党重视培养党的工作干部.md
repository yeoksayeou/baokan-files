Our Correspondent Li He reported from Moscow on the 5th: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union attaches importance to the training of party work cadres. The Higher Party School directly under the CPSU Central Committee trains many cadres who have undergone advanced studies every year. Recently, the Higher Party School graduated 327 people, 100 of whom achieved excellent results. This group of graduates includes party, Soviet, and newspaper work cadres from 45 ethnic groups. The basic methods of study at the Higher Party School are listening to lectures and self-studying the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, and the documents of the Party and the government. There are also courses on industry and agriculture. Courses in agricultural technology, animal husbandry technology, and agricultural mechanization occupy a very important position. Students and advanced workers in industry and agriculture meet not only at the school but also in factories and farms. During their studies, the students went to the Moscow Party organizations to carry out propaganda and mobilization work, gave reports and lectures to workers, led propaganda research classes, and completed individual assignments from the Moscow Party organizations. A large number of the graduates were sent to areas reclaiming new land to do leadership work. This academic year, 786 correspondence students graduated from the Higher Party School. Among them, 492 are leading cadres - secretaries of state, city, and district committees, and heads and deputy heads of various departments of Party committees in republics, border regions, and states. There are also party work cadres from Sakhalin Island, the North, and the South.
