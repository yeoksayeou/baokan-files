    China's Representative Speaks at World Federation of Democratic Youth Council Meeting
    Proposes Opinions on Launching Youth Movements in Colonial and Semi-Colonial Countries
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 11th] The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council Beijing Meeting continued its general assembly on the morning of the 11th, proceeding with discussions on the first agenda item.
    Sixty-seven countries were represented at the morning session, with 250 observers and guests in attendance.
    Attendees warmly welcomed the speech by Liu Daosheng, representative of the Chinese youth delegation. When Liu Daosheng walked onto the stage and at the end of his speech, all attendees rose to their feet, and the hall resounded with sustained applause.
    In his speech, Liu Daosheng, based on the experience of the Chinese youth movement, put forward opinions on launching youth movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries, which greatly encouraged the representatives.
    Liu Daosheng said that our country had long suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression, and only a few years ago, due to the victory of the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, did we end the history of being oppressed and enslaved. In the long and arduous struggle, Chinese youth, together with the people of the whole country, experienced the tests of various struggles and contributed their strength to the cause of Chinese people's liberation. Chinese youth deeply experienced the profound suffering of youth in oppressed nations and fully understood the strong desire of youth in these countries for national independence and a better life. With deep sympathy, we care about the fate of youth in oppressed nations and care about their heroic struggles against imperialist oppression and enslavement.
    Liu Daosheng pointed out that the primary problem facing the vast number of youth in colonial and semi-colonial countries is the problem of imperialist oppression, the problem of national survival. Imperialist oppression and enslavement harms the interests of the broad masses of the people and also harms the interests of the youth in these countries. In colonial and semi-colonial countries, the anti-imperialist struggle is inseparable from the struggle for democracy and the anti-feudal struggle. Therefore, organizing the vast number of youth to participate in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle is the central content of the youth movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries. At the same time, attention should also be paid to the daily political and economic demands of young people.
    Liu Daosheng said: We all acknowledge that expanding youth unity and developing a broad youth united front in colonial countries is of great significance for strengthening the youth's struggle for peace, national independence, and a better future for youth. In countries where imperialist oppression is increasingly severe, unity is not only necessary but also possible. In fact, youth organizations in many countries have already established common actions and friendly relations along the path of mutual consultation and cooperation. There are various youth organizations in these countries, including youth of various races, parties, religions, and beliefs. As long as they are forces for peace and patriotism, they should unite and strive for a common goal, which is peace, national independence, and opposition to imperialist aggression.
    Liu Daosheng said that the era of imperialism doing whatever it wants in the colonies is gone forever. The strength and development of the peace forces headed by the Soviet Union has greatly encouraged the courage of these countries to struggle. The fact that the Geneva Conference recently reached an agreement on the armistice in Indochina once again proves that the will of mankind to fight for freedom is invincible and the forces of peace are invincible. The just cause of youth in colonial and dependent countries fighting for national independence will surely achieve final victory, although there are still difficulties.
    Liu Daosheng finally said that the Chinese youth delegation believes that this Council meeting's discussion on the youth movement in colonial and dependent countries will help the youth of these countries in their struggle for independence and against colonialism, and will help the unity and cooperation of youth from all countries in their struggle for peace. Chinese youth will always be faithful to the cause of promoting peace and friendship among youth of all countries and will always be a faithful and reliable friend of all oppressed nations.
    Also speaking at the morning meeting were Niger representative Mamani Abdoulaye, Ecuador representative Jorge Wu Cevallos Salas, Sudan representative Khawane Omate, Iceland representative Ingi R. Helgason, Ceylon representative Reggie Perera, Tunisia representative Mahmoud Seklani, United Kingdom representative Robert McGinnis, Romania representative Costica Alecu, and India representative Prabir. Representatives from the United States, the Netherlands, and Venezuela also spoke. Although they came from various countries, had different skin colors, wore different clothes, and viewed problems from various angles, they expressed a common will: to demand peace, oppose colonial wars, and fight for a better future for youth. Representatives from colonial and dependent countries accused the miserable situation they suffered under the colonial policies headed by US imperialism from various aspects and angles, and expressed their strong will to oppose colonialism and strive for national independence. Youth representatives from capitalist countries unanimously expressed their efforts to struggle and actively support the struggle of youth in various colonial and dependent countries for national independence and liberation.
    At the meeting, after the speech by Ecuadorian representative Jorge Wu Cevallos Salas, the Executive Chairman read a congratulatory telegram from the Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth congratulating Ecuador on the anniversary of its liberation from Spanish rule. The telegram also congratulated the Ecuadorian people on achieving complete liberation. The telegram was warmly welcomed by the audience.
    During the meeting, dozens of religious youth representatives from Beijing presented valuable gifts to the conference. When the gifts were presented, everyone stood up and applauded for a long time.
    Before the end of the morning meeting, the meeting passed the list of countries on the drafting committee for the first agenda item document with warm applause.

    我国代表在世界青联理事会会议上发言
    提出殖民地半殖民地国家开展青年运动意见
    【新华社十一日讯】世界民主青年联盟理事会北京会议十一日上午继续举行大会，进行关于第一项议程的讨论。
    出席上午会议的有六十七个国家的代表、列席观察员和来宾二百五十人。
    出席会议的人们热烈欢迎中国青年代表团代表刘导生的发言。当刘导生走上主席台时和讲话结束时，出席会议的人们全体起立，会场上响起了经久不息的掌声。
    刘导生在他的发言中，根据中国青年运动的经验，提出了关于殖民地半殖民地国家开展青年运动的意见，给代表们以很大鼓舞。
    刘导生说，我们的国家曾经长时期受过帝国主义的侵略和压迫，只在几年前由于反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义斗争的胜利，才结束了被压迫、被奴役的历史。在长期艰苦斗争中，我国青年和全国人民在一起，经历了各种斗争的考验，对中国人民解放事业贡献了自己的力量。中国青年深切地体验到被压迫民族的青年遭受的痛苦是如何的深重，充分地了解这些国家的青年要求民族独立和渴望建设美好生活的愿望是如何的强烈。我们怀着深切的同情，关怀被压迫民族青年的命运，关怀他们反对帝国主义压迫奴役所进行的英勇斗争。
    刘导生指出，殖民地半殖民地国家的广大青年首先面临着的问题，是帝国主义压迫问题，是民族生存问题。帝国主义的压迫、奴役危害着广大阶层人民的利益，也危害着这些国家青年的利益，而在殖民地半殖民地国家中，反帝斗争是和为民主的斗争与反封建的斗争分不开的。因此，组织广大青年参加反帝反封建的斗争是殖民地半殖民地国家青年运动的中心内容。但同时对青年日常的政治、经济要求，也应该予以关心和重视。
    刘导生说：我们都承认在殖民地国家中扩大青年团结，开展广泛的青年统一战线，对于加强青年争取和平、民族独立和青年的美好将来的斗争具有重要的意义。在受帝国主义压迫日益严重的国家中，团结不仅是必要的，而且是可能的。事实上许多国家的青年组织，已经沿着互相协商合作的道路，建立共同行动，建立友好关系，这些国家中存在多种多样的青年组织，包括各种不同种族、党派、宗教、信仰的青年。只要是和平与爱国的力量都应当联合起来，为着一个共同的目标，就是和平、民族独立、反对帝国主义侵略而奋斗。
    刘导生说，帝国主义对殖民地为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了。以苏联为首的和平力量的强大和发展，大大地鼓舞了这些国家的斗争勇气。最近日内瓦会议就印度支那停战达成协议的这个事实，又一次证明人类争取自由的意志是不可战胜的，和平的力量是不可战胜的。殖民地附属国青年为民族独立而斗争的正义事业，虽然还有困难，但必将获得最后的胜利。
    刘导生最后说，中国青年代表团认为这次理事会会议对殖民地附属国青年运动展开讨论，将有助于这些国家的青年争取独立、反对殖民主义的斗争，有助于各国青年为和平而斗争的团结和合作。中国青年永远忠实于促进各国青年和平友谊的事业，永远是一切被压迫民族忠实可靠的朋友。
    在上午会议上发言的，还有尼日尔代表马曼尼·阿卜杜勒、厄瓜多尔代表豪尔赫·吴·塞瓦略斯·萨拉斯、苏丹代表华内·奥马特、冰岛代表英吉·鲁·赫尔嘉逊、锡兰代表雷奇·培里拉、突尼斯代表马茂德·塞克拉尼、英国代表罗伯特·麦金尼斯、罗马尼亚代表科斯蒂卡·阿列库、印度代表普拉比尔。美国、荷兰、委内瑞拉三国的代表也发了言。他们虽然来自各个国家，有着不同的肤色，穿着不同的衣着，讲着各种不同的语言，从各种不同的角度来看问题，但他们却表达了一个共同的意志：要求和平，反对殖民战争，为青年们美好的未来而斗争。殖民地附属国的代表从各种不同的方面和不同的角度控诉了他们在以美帝国主义为首的殖民政策下所遭受到的悲惨境遇，表示了他们反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的坚强意志。资本主义国家的青年代表在发言中，一致表示努力斗争，积极支援各殖民地附属国青年争取民族独立解放的斗争。
    会上，当厄瓜多尔代表豪尔赫·吴·塞瓦略斯·萨拉斯发言后，执行主席宣读了一份世界民主青年联盟书记处祝贺厄瓜多尔从西班牙统治下解放纪念日的贺电，贺电中并祝贺厄瓜多尔人民获得完全解放。贺电受到全场热烈欢迎。
    会议进行时，北京数十名宗教青年代表曾向大会敬献珍贵的礼品。献礼时，全体起立，长久的大鼓掌。
    上午会议结束前，全场以热烈的掌声通过了会议关于第一项议程文件起草委员会的国家名单。
