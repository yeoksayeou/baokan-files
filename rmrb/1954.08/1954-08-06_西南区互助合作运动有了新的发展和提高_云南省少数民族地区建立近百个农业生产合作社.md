The mutual aid and cooperation movement in the Southwest Region has seen significant development in the first half of this year. Across the region, approximately 12.2 million peasant households have participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The proportion of organized farm households has risen from an average of 39% in the winter of last year to nearly 60%. A total of 1,536 agricultural production cooperatives have been established throughout the region, including 604 in Sichuan, 334 in Yunnan, 519 in Guizhou, 58 in Xikang, and 21 in Chongqing. The vast majority of newly established and expanded agricultural production cooperatives have consolidated their position in production. Some cooperatives experienced confusion in production management when they were first established and put into operation, but this has now been significantly improved. Generally, cooperatives implement quota management based on production arrangements and gradually promote various forms of contracting systems, progressing from lower to higher levels. In Suining Special District, Sichuan Province, the 61 newly established and expanded cooperatives universally adopted the contracting system, correcting the shortcomings of chaotic labor allocation and work point assessment during the initial establishment phase, thereby improving production efficiency.

Under the influence of cooperative establishment in various regions, mutual aid teams have also seen significant development and improvement. Some areas have adopted the method of establishing mutual aid and cooperation networks to drive various types of mutual aid teams at all levels. In Jiangjin Special District, Sichuan Province, 57 cooperatives have established close ties with four to five mutual aid teams each. There are now 990,000 mutual aid teams of various types across the province, an increase of more than 200,000 since before the spring plowing. Among them, permanent mutual aid teams have increased from the original 100,000 to 220,000. Yunnan Province is universally using mutual aid and cooperation representative conferences, organized visits, and integrating mutual aid teams and individual farmers into agricultural production cooperative summaries to drive mutual aid teams. There are now 34,000 permanent mutual aid teams, an increase of more than fivefold since the end of last year. By the end of April, seven counties in Ya'an Special District, Xikang Province, had newly developed 1,589 mutual aid teams, of which 601 had been cultivated and upgraded to permanent mutual aid teams. In Zunyi Special District, Guizhou Province, organized farm households have reached 65% of the total farm households, and permanent mutual aid teams have increased from 6% of the organized farm households last winter to 20%. All provinces have established a number of interconnected mutual aid teams based on permanent mutual aid teams, becoming a transitional organizational form for establishing cooperatives. More than 18,000 of the 220,000 permanent mutual aid teams in Sichuan Province are preparing to establish cooperatives. In Yunnan Province, more than 3,000 teams have prepared the conditions for establishing cooperatives. Currently, various regions are continuing to consolidate and improve mutual aid and cooperative organizations in conjunction with summer production.

Ninety-five agricultural production cooperatives of minority nationalities have been established in the inland ethnic regions of Yunnan Province. These cooperatives were all established after January of this year and are distributed in nine special districts, including Dali and Lijiang, and the suburbs of Kunming and Gejiu, of which 69 are organized by two or more ethnic groups. The production cooperatives have overcome many difficulties in drought prevention and resistance, spring plowing, and rice transplanting, ensuring timely planting. The "May Fourth" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinmin Township, Mengzi County, led the farmers of the entire village in building five ponds, saving more than 300 mu of drought-stricken crops and seedlings due to water shortages. The Naxi ethnic group's "Lihong" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yangxi Township, Lijiang County, plowed the paddy fields multiple times, and the amount of fertilizer applied was also increased compared to previous years. When drought threatened the growth of seedlings, the entire cooperative immediately repaired ditches and dug ponds. The members also helped the mutual aid teams in the village to carry water to save the seedlings, and gave the cooperative's accumulated water to the mutual aid teams for use, promoting the drought resistance struggle in the surrounding villages and ensuring that the seedlings in the entire township safely survived the drought period. The Dai ethnic group's "Dawn" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiangdong Township, Jinggu County, overcame the drought and transplanted the seedlings more than 20 days ahead of schedule due to the full mobilization of the labor enthusiasm of all the female members of the cooperative. The consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives has inspired the enthusiasm of farmers of all ethnic groups for mutual assistance. In many villages with agricultural production cooperatives, most farmers have been organized. Before the establishment of the "May Fourth" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yujia Village, Xinmin Township, Mengzi County, there was not a single mutual aid team. By June of this year, there were seven mutual aid teams in this village, with organized farm households accounting for 86% of the total households. The production cooperatives also frequently invite the leaders of various mutual aid teams to exchange experiences and listen to their opinions on the cooperatives, and are called "big brothers" by the mutual aid teams.

    西南区互助合作运动有了新的发展和提高
    云南省少数民族地区建立近百个农业生产合作社
    西南区互助合作运动今年上半年有了很大的发展。全区约已有一千二百多万户农民参加了互助合作组织，组织起来的农户平均已从去年冬季占总农户的百分之三十九上升到将近百分之六十左右。全区现已建立起一千五百三十六个农业生产合作社，计四川六百零四个，云南三百三十四个、贵州五百一十九个、西康五十八个、重庆二十一个。绝大部分新建和扩建的农业生产合作社在生产中都已巩固下来。一部分社在建社完成投入生产时，在生产管理上存在某些混乱现象，现已有了显著改变。一般社根据生产安排，实行定额管理，逐步推行由低级到高级的各种形式的包工制度。四川省遂宁专区新建和扩建的六十一个社普遍采用包工制后，纠正了初建时在劳动力调配和评工记分方面混乱的缺点，提高了生产效率。
    在各地办社影响下，互助组也有了很大发展和提高。有些地区采取建立互助合作网的办法，层层带动各种类型的互助组。四川省江津专区五十七个社，每个社都分别和四、五个互助组建立了密切的联系。全省现已有各种类型互助组九十九万个，比春耕前增加二十多万个。其中，常年互助组已从原有的十万个增加到二十二万个。云南省普遍运用互助合作代表会、组织参观、吸收互助组和单干农民参加农业生产合作社总结等方式，带动互助组。现已有常年互助组三万四千个，比去年底增加了五倍多。西康省雅安专区七个县到四月底止，新发展了一千五百八十九个互助组，其中经过培养提高为常年互助组的达六百零一个。贵州省遵义专区组织起来的农户已达总农户的百分之六十五，常年互助组由去冬占组织起来农户的百分之六增加到百分之二十。各省都建立了一批以常年互助组为基础的互助联组，成为建社的一种过渡的组织形式。四川省二十二万个常年互助组中已有一万八千多个准备建社。云南省已有三千多个组为办社准备好了条件。现各地正结合夏季生产，继续进行互助合作组织的巩固提高工作。
    云南省内地民族地区建立了九十五个少数民族的农业生产合作社。这些合作社都是在今年一月以后建立的，分布在大理、丽江等九个专区和昆明、个旧两市郊区，其中有六十九个是由两种或两种以上的民族组织起来的。生产合作社在防旱抗旱、春耕、插秧等农事活动中克服了很多困难，保证了及时栽种。蒙自县新民乡“五四”农业生产合作社带动全村农民，兴修了五个水塘，挽救了缺水的三百多亩旱地作物和秧苗。丽江县漾西乡纳西族“黎红”农业生产合作社的秧田犁了多次，施肥量也比往年增加。当旱象威胁着秧苗成长的时候，全社立即修沟挖塘，社员们还帮助本村各互助组挑水救苗，把社里的积水让给互助组使用，推动了周围各村寨的抗旱斗争，使全乡秧苗安全渡过旱期。景谷县江东乡傣族“曙光”农业生产合作社由于充分发挥了全社女社员的劳动积极性，战胜了旱灾，提前二十多天栽下了秧苗。农业生产合作社的巩固和发展，启发了各族农民互助的积极性。许多有生产合作社的村寨，大部分农民已组织起来。蒙自县新民乡余家寨在建立“五四”农业生产合作社以前，没有一个互助组，到今年六月，这个寨子里就有了七个互助组，组织起来的农户占总户数的百分之八十六。生产合作社还经常邀请各互助组组长交流经验，并听取他们对合作社的意见，被互助组称为“老大哥”。　（新华社）
