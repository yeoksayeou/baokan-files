    Yunnan Province Trains and Transfers Large Numbers of Cadres
    to Support Various Construction Projects in Border Minority Areas

    Party and government leading organs in Yunnan Province have trained and transferred a large number of cadres to support various construction projects in border minority areas. In recent years, more than 5,000 cadres have been transferred to the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region, and the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region. The Provincial People's Government has also successively organized three ethnic work teams to carry out work in various ethnic regions of the border areas in conjunction with the ethnic work teams of various special districts. The Southwest Region and Yunnan Province health agencies have dispatched twenty-two medical and epidemic prevention teams to conduct mobile medical work in various border areas.

    Cadres sent to work in the border areas have generally gradually established the idea of ​​long-term construction of the border areas and serving the people of all ethnic groups. Many cadres are not only able to cooperate closely with ethnic minority cadres in their work, but also have established deep friendships with the people of all ethnic groups. In the year-end performance appraisal of 1953 conducted by the directly affiliated agencies and ethnic work teams of the People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in May this year, thirty model cadres who actively served the people of all ethnic groups and conscientiously implemented ethnic policies were selected. The model deeds of Yi cadre Li Shuang from the ethnic work team in Luxi County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region, who actively united the Jingpo people, overcame difficulties, and developed production, have become a model for cadres in the border areas to learn from.

    The transfer of a large number of cadres to the border areas and the growth of local ethnic cadres have promoted various construction undertakings in the border areas. Now, the Hani, Miao, Yao, and other ethnic people living in the high mountains can buy industrial products produced in major cities transported by mobile trade teams. In remote villages near the border line, there are also mobile health teams carrying out prevention and treatment work. Medical teams, epidemic prevention teams, and medical groups dispatched by governments at all levels have formed a health work network. Through their active prevention and treatment, they have effectively controlled various long-term prevalent diseases in the area. According to estimates by the Yunnan Provincial People's Government Health Department, since liberation, more than 5 million people in border counties have received treatment and vaccinations, and the incidence and mortality rates of diseases such as malaria and dysentery have been declining year by year.

    云南省训练和抽调大批干部
    支援边疆少数民族地区各项建设工作
    云南省党政领导机关训练和抽调大批干部，支援边疆少数民族地区，开展各项建设工作。几年来，调往西双版纳傣族自治区、德宏傣族景颇族自治区和红河哈尼族自治区的干部，共有五千多名。省人民政府还先后组织了三个民族工作队，会同各专区民族工作队开展边疆各民族区的工作；西南区及云南省卫生机关派遣了二十二个医疗队和防疫队，在边疆各地进行巡回医疗工作。
    派到边疆工作的干部，一般都逐步树立了长期建设边疆、为各族人民服务的思想。许多干部在工作中不仅能和少数民族干部亲密合作，并且和各族人民建立了深厚的友谊。西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府直属机关和民族工作队在今年五月进行的一九五三年年终考绩中，就评选出积极为各族人民服务、认真执行民族政策的模范干部三十名。民族工作队彝族干部李双，在德宏傣族景颇族自治区潞西县积极团结景颇族人民，战胜困难发展生产的模范事迹，成为边疆干部学习的榜样。
    大批干部调往边疆和当地各民族干部的成长，推动了边疆各项建设事业。现在，居处在高山上的哈尼、苗、瑶等族人民，已经可以买到流动贸易小组运去的各大城市生产的工业品；在国境线附近偏僻的村寨里，也有流动卫生小组进行防治工作。各级人民政府派出的医疗队、防疫队和医疗小组，已经形成了卫生工作网。经过他们的积极防治，有效地控制了当地长期流行的各种疾病。据云南省人民政府卫生厅的估计，边疆各县解放以来得到治疗和预防注射的已达五百万人次以上，疟疾、痢疾等疾病的发病率和死亡率已逐年下降。
