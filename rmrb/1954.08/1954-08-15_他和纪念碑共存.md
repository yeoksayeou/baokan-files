    He Coexists with the Monument
    On the evening of July 16th at 11 o'clock, the Ru River swelled, and some villages were flooded. The entire unit of a certain People's Liberation Army stationed in Runan County, Henan Province, mobilized to rescue the disaster-stricken people's grain. Chen Junfeng, a member of the Communist Youth League, set out with everyone. Upon arriving at the homes of the disaster victims, he first loaded bags for the other soldiers, and then carried a large bag of grain himself, hurrying to the front of the line, wading through the water. Once, he and several soldiers were helping a family of disaster victims carry grain, and some barley seeds were left. The villagers initially didn't want them, but he earnestly persuaded them to take them. He said to soldier Wu Liangzhi, "A single grain of food is also the people's property." In this way, after a night of fighting, they defeated the flood for the first time, preventing the loss of the people's property.
    Early the next morning, the Ru River had already overflowed its banks on the outskirts of the city. The soldiers had not yet had time to rest when an urgent instruction came from above, requiring each unit to immediately select eighteen comrades who could swim to rescue the disaster-stricken people. Although Comrade Chen Junfeng had not slept all night and had not eaten well, the sense of responsibility for ensuring the safety of the people's lives and property made him forget his fatigue and disregard his hunger. He volunteered to participate in the rescue. Comrade Chen Junfeng helped the masses transport property back and forth for four trips across a distance of two and a half li in the waist-deep rapids. In the afternoon, on the way back, he unfortunately fell into a deep pool and sacrificed his life.
    Comrade Chen Junfeng's sacrifice deeply moved the people fighting the flood. Now, the flood of the Ru River has been tamed and returned to its channel, and the people of the entire city have safely survived four flood peaks. Although Comrade Chen Junfeng has sacrificed his life, his spirit will forever coexist with the monument erected for him by the people of the entire city.

    他和纪念碑共存
    七月十六日晚上十一点钟，汝河水涨，部分村庄被淹，住在河南省汝南县的人民解放军某部全体出动，抢救受灾群众的粮食。青年团员陈俊峰和大家一起出发，到了灾民家里，他先给其他战士装包，然后自己扛上一大包粮食赶上去，仍走在队伍前面?水。有一次，他和几个战士帮助一户灾民扛粮食，最后还剩一些大麦种籽，老乡本不想要了，他却苦口动员老乡带走，他对战士吴良之说：“一颗粮食，也是人民的财产。”就这样，经过一夜的战斗，他们第一次战胜了洪水，使得人民财产避免了损失。
    第二天一早，汝河河水已在城郊漫堤，战士们还没来得及休息，上面又来了紧急指示，要各部立即抽调十八个会水的同志去抢救受灾群众。陈俊峰同志虽然一夜没有睡觉，饭也没有吃好，但保障人民生命财产安全的责任心，使他忘记了疲劳，顾不得饥饿，又报名参加抢救了。陈俊峰同志在水深齐腰的急流中，帮助群众在二里多的距离里往返抢运了四趟财物。下午，在返回途中，他不幸落入深潭牺牲了。
    陈俊峰同志的牺牲深深激动着与洪水搏斗的人们。现在，汝河洪水驯服地归槽了，全城人民安全地度过了四次洪峰，陈俊峰同志虽然牺牲了，可是他的精神将与全城人民为他立的纪念碑永远并存。
