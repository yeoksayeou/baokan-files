Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 13th: The first session of the First Fujian Provincial People's Congress solemnly resolved that resolutely liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu, which are occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, is the central task of the people of the entire province from now on, and all other tasks should revolve around this central task. The meeting also unanimously passed a resolution calling on the people of the entire province to actively carry out various preparations and strive to support the People's Liberation Army in completing this sacred task.

During the meeting, Ye Fei, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Provincial People's Government, made an important report on this central task. Representatives from various regions and social strata engaged in enthusiastic discussions. Liu Peishan, Deputy Political Commissar of the Fujian Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, representing all commanders and fighters stationed in Fujian Province, issued a solemn oath: The People's Liberation Army must take on the glorious task of liberating Taiwan. He said: "Taiwan has been an inseparable and sacred territory of our country since ancient times. Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandits is part of the sacred liberation cause of the Chinese people. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Fujian Province, facing Jinmen and Taiwan, bear a more significant responsibility for liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands. We will step up political and military training, and with the support of the people of the whole country, resolutely carry out the glorious task of liberating Taiwan."

Wei Gangchang, a representative from the coastal defense outpost of Pingtan Island and a provincial model fisherman, and Gu Wenchang, a representative from the heroic Dongshan Island, both expressed at the conference the determination and will of the vast number of coastal fishermen to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands such as Jinmen. Wei Gangchang angrily denounced the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek gang at the meeting, saying, "These pirates rob our fishing boats and capture young and strong fishermen. This hatred must be avenged, and this blood debt must be settled!" Gu Wenchang said, "The people of Dongshan Island, who have been tested in battle, will definitely support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan with all our strength. We will provide people if needed, and boats if needed!" Zhang Lian, a representative from the Jinjiang Special District, said in his speech: Taiwan is our country's territory, and Jinmen is a county under the jurisdiction of Jinjiang Special District. Now the people of Taiwan and Jinmen are living in dire straits under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, longing for liberation. We deeply care about these compatriots who are suffering and will never tolerate the traitor Chiang Kai-shek selling our country's territory and compatriots to American imperialism. We are determined to mobilize the people of the entire district to make all preparations and be ready to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and Jinmen at any time.

All the people's representatives unanimously believe that supporting the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands of Fujian is a particularly glorious task for the people of Fujian Province. They expressed that they will never stop until the goal is achieved.
