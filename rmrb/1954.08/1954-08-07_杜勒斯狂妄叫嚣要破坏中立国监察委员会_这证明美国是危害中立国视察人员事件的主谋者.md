Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: Xinhua commentator Wu Min comments: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made a statement at a press conference on August 3rd, openly stating that the United States will take measures to "end" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. This completely exposes that the United States is the mastermind behind the threats and harm to the neutral nations personnel supervising the armistice agreement in South Korea.

In order to create an excuse for the United States and its running dog Syngman Rhee to sabotage the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, Dulles wildly slandered the Korean-Chinese side and the Czechoslovakian and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, attempting to obliterate the positive role played by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in assisting the implementation of the armistice agreement. However, a review of the documents and reports issued by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission reveals that it is precisely the United States that has unscrupulously violated the armistice agreement and obstructed the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from performing its legitimate duties, not the Korean-Chinese side. In order to arm more Syngman Rhee puppet troops and strengthen its military power in South Korea, the United States has continuously violated the armistice agreement and shipped in a large number of reinforcing military supplies from outside Korea. The United States has made every effort to obstruct, interfere with, and sabotage the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its neutral nations inspection teams, making it impossible for them to conduct effective supervision and inspection. However, the Czech and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, in order to ensure the implementation of the armistice agreement for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, have persistently adhered to inspection and supervision work and exposed the United States' violations of the armistice agreement. Obviously, the existence of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, especially the impartial and agreement-abiding Czech and Polish members, has become a thorn in the side of the United States. Dulles's malicious slander conceals a sinister conspiracy to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, so that it can fully expand and strengthen the military power of the Syngman Rhee group, re-ignite the war, and create tension in the Far East.

In order to realize his sinister plot to sabotage the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, Dulles openly claimed that the clauses in the armistice agreement concerning the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are "invalid" and stated that he would unilaterally tamper with the armistice agreement jointly agreed upon and accepted by the Korean belligerent parties, and "abolish" the clauses concerning neutral nations supervision and inspection. Dulles is attempting to once again steal the flag of the United Nations to cover up this illegal act. He openly stated that the United States has discussed the "possibility" of "ending" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission with other countries invading Korea and will bring this issue up at the next United Nations General Assembly. Dulles's conspiracy is clearly an attempt to coerce its allies within the United Nations to unilaterally tamper with the armistice agreement, use the solemn flag of the United Nations to cover up this illegal action by the United States, and make its allies share the serious responsibility for the United States' sabotage of the armistice agreement concerning the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. However, the armistice agreement is a joint agreement between the headquarters of the Korean-Chinese People's Army and the headquarters of the United Nations Command, and the United Nations, as a belligerent party, is not qualified or entitled to unilaterally tamper with the armistice agreement. Article 61 of the armistice agreement clearly stipulates that "amendments and supplements to this armistice agreement must be agreed upon by the commanders of the opposing sides," and Article 62 stipulates that "all clauses of this armistice agreement shall remain in effect until they are explicitly replaced by amendments and supplements jointly accepted by both parties..." Therefore, Dulles's attempt to tamper with the armistice agreement in the name of the United Nations is completely illegal and unreasonable.

In order to divert public attention from the serious consequences that will result from the United States' plot to sabotage the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, Dulles has been trying to convince people that the abolition of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will "not affect" the implementation of the armistice agreement, and has greatly touted the U.S. authorities' "sincerity" towards the armistice agreement. But everyone knows that the clauses concerning the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are an integral and indispensable part of the armistice agreement, guaranteeing the stability of the military armistice by supervising both sides' fulfillment of the obligations stipulated in the armistice agreement. Moreover, practical experience in Korea has irrefutably proven that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission plays a significant role in assisting the implementation of the armistice agreement and restricting the Syngman Rhee authorities' unscrupulous violations of the armistice agreement. As for Dulles's great touting of the United States' "sincerity," it is chilling. A quick look at the United States' record of violating the armistice agreement since the armistice is enough to make it clear. No fair-minded person would believe in this kind of sincerity on the part of the United States. It is very obvious that the reason why the U.S. authorities are so eagerly attacking the Korean armistice agreement and want to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is to be able to arm the Syngman Rhee puppet army without any hindrance and further create instability in the Korean armistice. The duty of the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be to uphold the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its power to perform its legitimate duties, and to oppose and thwart this provocative conspiracy by the United States. If some members are intimidated by this arrogant action of the United States and attempt to follow the United States in harming the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, then it will only encourage the sabotage actions of the United States and Syngman Rhee and have a detrimental impact on the Korean armistice.

### 杜勒斯狂妄叫嚣要破坏中立国监察委员会  这证明美国是危害中立国视察人员事件的主谋者

    杜勒斯狂妄叫嚣要破坏中立国监察委员会
    这证明美国是危害中立国视察人员事件的主谋者
    【新华社五日讯】本社评论员吴敏评论：美国国务卿杜勒斯八月三日在记者招待会上发表谈话，公开表示美国将要采取措施“结束”中立国监察委员会。这就完全暴露了美国是威胁和危害在南朝鲜监督停战协定的实施的中立国人员的主谋。
    为了给美国和它的走狗李承晚制造破坏中立国监察委员会的借口，杜勒斯大肆诬蔑朝中方面和中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员，力图抹煞中立国监察委员会对协助停战协定的执行所起的积极作用。但是，只要考察一下中立国监察委员会发表的文件和报告就可以看出，肆无忌惮违反停战协定，并阻挠中立国监察委员会执行它的合法职司的恰恰不是朝中方面，而是美国自己。美国为了武装更多的李承晚伪军和加强在南朝鲜的军事力量，不断地违反停战协定，从朝鲜境外运入大批增援性的军事物资。美国竭力对中立国监察委员会和它的中立国视察小组的工作加以阻挠、干涉和破坏，使得它们不能进行有效的监察和视察。但是，中立国监察委员会捷、波委员为了保证停战协定的实施以利于朝鲜问题的和平解决，始终不懈地坚持了视察和监察工作，并揭露了美国的这种违反停战协定的行为。很显然，中立国监察委员的存在特别是公正无私和信守协定的捷、波委员已成为美国的眼中钉。杜勒斯的恶毒诽谤，背后的险毒阴谋，就是要取消中立国监察委员会，以便它完全放手地扩充和加强李承晚集团的军事力量，重新挑起战争，制造远东紧张局势。
    杜勒斯为了实现他破坏中立国监察委员会的罪恶阴谋，公开声称停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的条款已经“无效”，并且表示要片面窜改朝鲜敌对双方共同协议和接受的停战协定，“废除”有关中立国监察和视察的条款。杜勒斯企图再一次盗用联合国的旗帜来掩饰这种非法行为。他公开表示，美国已经和其他侵朝国家讨论了“结束”中立国监察委员会的“可能性”，并且将在下一届联合国大会上把这个问题提出来。杜勒斯的这个阴谋显然是企图在联合国内挟持它的盟国来片面窜改停战协定，使联合国的庄严旗帜为美国的这种非法行动遮羞，使它的盟国分担美国破坏停战协定有关中立国监察委员会的条款的严重责任。但是，停战协定是朝中人民军队司令部和联合国军总司令部之间的共同的协议，作为交战一方的联合国没有资格和权利来片面窜改停战协定。停战协定第六十一款明白规定，“对本停战协定的修正与增补必须经敌对双方司令官相互协议”，第六十二款并规定，“本停战协定各条款，在未为双方共同接受的修正与增补……所明确代替以前，继续有效”。因此，杜勒斯企图假借联合国的名义来窜改停战协定是完全非法的，毫无道理的。
    为了转移公众对美国破坏中立国监察委员会的阴谋将引起的严重的后果的注意，杜勒斯竭力要人相信，中立国监察委员会的取消“不影响”停战协定的实施，并且大事吹嘘美国当局对停战协定的“诚意”。但是大家知道，有关中立国监察委员会的条款，是停战协定中监督双方履行停战协定所规定的义务，保证军事停战的稳定的不可分割和缺少的重要组成部分。而且，朝鲜的实际经验也无可辩驳地证明，中立国监察委员会对协助停战协定的实施和限制美李当局的肆无忌惮地违反停战协定是有重大作用的。至于杜勒斯大事吹嘘美国的“诚意”，是令人齿冷的。只要查一查美国自停战以来违反停战协定的记录就十分清楚。美国的这种诚意，是没有
  一个公正的人士会相信的。事情非常明显，美国当局所以迫不及待地向朝鲜停战协定进攻，要取消中立国监察委员会，就是为了要毫无阻碍地来武装李承晚伪军，进一步制造朝鲜停战的不稳定。作为中立国监察委员会的委员的职责应该是维护中立国监察委员会以及它执行合法职司的权力，反对和挫败美国的这种挑衅性阴谋。如果有的委员竟被美国的这种狂妄行动吓倒，企图跟随美国来危害中立国监察委员会，那么只会使美国以及李承晚的破坏行动受到鼓励，使朝鲜停战受到有害的影响。
