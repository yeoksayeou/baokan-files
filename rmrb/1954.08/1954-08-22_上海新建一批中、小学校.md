Shanghai Builds a Batch of New Middle and Primary Schools

    The Shanghai Municipal People's Government has continued to build and expand a batch of middle and primary schools this year. At the same time, it has instructed the Municipal Education Bureau to fully utilize existing school facilities and tap their potential to appropriately expand the enrollment quota for middle and primary schools this autumn. In this way, the number of new middle school students enrolled in Shanghai this autumn will increase by 30,786 in junior high schools and 6,385 in senior high schools. In total, public and private middle schools can admit 37,171 more new students.

    This year, the basic construction investment for new construction and expansion of middle and primary schools in Shanghai, based on the Education Bureau system alone, is about two and a half times that of last year. The area of newly built and expanded school buildings, excluding playgrounds and roads, is more than 82,000 square meters. The new school buildings are generally two or three-story buildings. After all these new construction projects are completed, they can enroll approximately 17,000 more middle school students and more than 5,000 more primary school students. Most of the new construction and expansion projects can now be completed around the start of the autumn semester to welcome the beginning of the new academic year.

    In addition, secondary technical schools and specialized schools such as civil engineering schools, power industry schools, power machinery manufacturing schools, electrical appliance manufacturing schools, Shanghai Textile Industry School, health schools, and nursing schools, which are run by municipal construction departments, health departments, and industrial departments in Shanghai, have also been expanded this year. These schools have also appropriately expanded their new student quotas for the autumn enrollment this year. Some enterprise departments in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai Post Office and the Telecommunications Bureau, have also built schools to solve the problem of schooling for the children of their employees.

    The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has also instructed many schools to reasonably adjust the use of offices and laboratories to squeeze out some rooms to be converted into classrooms to expand classes. At the same time, some public and private middle schools are also preparing to implement a "two-shift system" from the next semester. According to statistics, after schools tap their potential and adopt a "two-shift system" of teaching, public and private middle school junior high schools can enroll 11,659 more new students, and senior high schools can enroll 4,491 more new students. In addition, two secondary remedial schools have been converted into ordinary middle schools, and six remedial schools have added junior high school classes. After this adjustment, a total of 3,408 new students can be enrolled.

    上海新建一批中、小学校
    上海市人民政府今年内继续新建和扩建了一批中、小学校；同时，又责成市教育局充分利用现有学校设备，发挥潜在力量，以适当扩大今年中、小学秋季招生名额。这样，今年上海市中学秋季招生数初中将增加三万零七百八十六人，高中将增加六千三百八十五人，合计公、私立中学可多吸收三万七千一百七十一名新生入学。
    今年上海市新建和扩建中、小学校的基本建设投资额，仅以教育局系统来看，约等于去年的两倍半。新建扩建学校的面积，不包括操场和道路在内，就有八万二千多平方公尺。新建校舍一般都是两三层楼的建筑。这些新建工程全部完工后，约可增收中学生一万七千人，小学生五千多人入学。现在，新建扩建工程大部分可以在秋季开学前后完成，以迎接新学年的开始。
    此外，市政建设部门、卫生部门和工业部门在上海所办的中等技术学校和专业性学校如土木工程学校、动力工业学校、动力机器制造学校、电器制造学校、上海纺织工业学校、卫生学校、护士学校等，今年也都进行了扩建。这些学校在今年秋季招生中，也都适当扩大了新生名额。上海市若干企业部门，如上海邮局、电信局等单位，也兴建了学校，以解决本单位职工子女的入学问题。
    上海市教育局还责成许多学校合理调整了办公室和实验室等的使用，挤出部分房间改为教室，以扩展班级。同时，一部分公私立中学下学期起又准备实行“二部制”。据统计，各校发挥潜力，采取
  “二部制”教学后，公、私立中学初中可多收新生一万一千六百五十九人；高中可多收新生四千四百九十一人。又有两所中等补习学校转为普通中学，有六所补习学校增加初中班，经此调整后，共可招新生三千四百零八名。
