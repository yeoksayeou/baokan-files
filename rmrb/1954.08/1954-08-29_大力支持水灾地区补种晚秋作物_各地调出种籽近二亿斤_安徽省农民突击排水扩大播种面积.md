Vigorously Support Flood-Affected Areas in Replenishing Late Autumn Crops
Nearly 200 Million Jin of Seeds Transferred from Various Regions
Anhui Province Farmers Rush to Drain Water and Expand Planting Area
[Report from this newspaper] To vigorously support the disaster areas with the seeds needed for replanting late autumn crops, all regions have highly promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship. As of now, the late autumn crop seeds allocated and being allocated to the disaster areas from various regions have reached over 170 million jin, according to incomplete statistics. This includes over 98 million jin of grain seeds, over 76 million jin of potato seeds, and over 370,000 jin of vegetable seeds. Among the grain seeds, over 43 million jin were decided to be allocated jointly by the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, including over 33 million jin transferred from North China, Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, Northwest China, and other major regions to Anhui Province, and over 10 million jin to Hubei Province. Various grain seeds directly negotiated and allocated by major regions and provinces amounted to over 54 million jin.

The aforementioned various late autumn crop seeds supplied to the disaster areas can approximately meet the needs of over 33 million mu of planting area. With the active assistance of various transportation departments, most of the seeds have been transported to their destinations on schedule.

In addition to the seeds transferred by the government, various regions have also mobilized the masses to raise and exchange seeds themselves, launching a mutual aid and mutual relief movement. The seed problem has been basically solved, thus ensuring the planting of late autumn crops. According to incomplete statistics from Sui County, Gucheng County, Zaoyang County, Xiangyang County, and Guanghua County in Hubei Province, the area of interplanting, replanting, and wasteland planting has reached more than 1.1 million mu. The area of interplanting and replanting in Enshi Prefecture has exceeded the planned target. (Zhang Jian)

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 28th: Nearly 20 million mu of medium-season rice in hilly areas, mountainous areas, and areas slightly affected by floods in Anhui Province have generally achieved a bumper harvest. In the Lu'an Prefecture, over 5.8 million mu of medium-season rice can yield an average of about 350 jin per mu, with some good areas yielding over 400 jin, exceeding the original increase plan by more than 10% and the actual yield last year by about 20%. The medium-season rice in Chuxian Prefecture and along the Xin'an River in southern Anhui can also reach or exceed the production increase targets. The medium-season rice yield of agricultural production cooperatives in these areas has exceeded the medium-season rice yield of mutual aid teams and individual farmers in the local area by 10% to 20%. The Yuanjiacai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qishibu Township, Feixi County, has harvested seven and a half mu of medium-season rice, with an average yield of more than 547 jin per mu, exceeding the original production increase plan by more than 20%.

While harvesting medium-season rice, the vast number of farmers in non-disaster areas and disaster areas are also vigorously expanding the planting area and replanting area of late autumn crops, striving to achieve the province's plan to increase grain production by 3 billion jin. Now, farmers across the province are rushing to drain water and replant and interplant various late autumn crops. As of August 24th, under the leadership of over 4,270 agricultural production cooperatives and over 400,000 mutual aid teams throughout the province, farmers have drained water and replanted over 12 million mu of late autumn crops, newly cultivated over 4.4 million mu of wasteland, most of which has been planted, and interplanted over 3.7 million mu of cowpeas, soybeans, corn, and other crops in existing irrigated and dry-land grain fields. In addition, late autumn crops have been planted in 720,000 mu of fallow land. Farmers in rice-producing areas have harvested 20 million mu of medium-season rice ahead of schedule, preparing to cultivate a crop of "regenerated rice" in 70% of the rice fields. The late autumn crops planted in various regions have begun to sprout and are growing well.

    大力支持水灾地区补种晚秋作物
    各地调出种籽近二亿斤
    安徽省农民突击排水扩大播种面积
    【本报讯】为了大力支持灾区补种晚秋所需要的种籽，各地高度发扬了互助友爱精神，截至目前止，各地已经拨给和正在拨给灾区的晚秋作物种籽，据不完全统计，已达一亿又七千多万斤。其中粮食种籽九千八百多万斤，马铃薯种籽七千六百多万斤，蔬菜种籽三十七万多斤。粮食种籽中，由中央人民政府粮食部和农业部共同决定调拨的为四千三百多万斤，计从华北、内蒙、东北、西北等各大区调给安徽省三千三百多万斤，湖北省一千多万斤。由各大区及各省直接接洽调拨的各种粮食种籽为五千四百多万斤。
    上述供应灾区的各种晚秋作物的种籽，约可解决三千三百余万亩播种面积的需要。在各运输部门积极协助下，已大部按期运达目的地。
    除政府调运的种籽以外，各地并发动群众自筹互换，开展了互助互济运动，种籽问题已基本上得到解决，因而保证了晚秋作物的播种工作。据湖北省随县、谷城、枣阳、襄阳、光化等五县不完全的统计，套种、补种及开荒播种的面积共达一百一十多万亩；恩施专区套种、补种的面积，已超额完成了计划。　（张　建）
    【新华社合肥二十八日电】安徽省丘陵地区、山区和受轻微水灾地区的近两千万亩中熟稻一般都获得丰收。六安专区五百八十多万亩中熟稻平均每亩可收到三百五十斤左右，其中少数好的可收四百斤以上，比原增产计划多收一成以上，比去年实际产量约增产两成。滁县专区和安徽南部新安江沿岸的中熟稻也可达到或超过增产指标。这些地区的农业生产合作社的中熟稻产量，都超过了当地互助组和单干农民中熟稻产量的一成到两成。肥西县七十埠乡袁家才农业生产合作社已收割的七亩半中熟稻，每亩平均产量达到五百四十七斤多，比原订增产计划多收了二成多。
    与收割中稻同时，广大非灾区和灾区农民还大力扩大晚秋作物的播种面积和复种面积，争取实现全省增产三十亿斤粮食的计划。现在全省农民正突击排水补种和间种、套种各种晚秋作物。到八月二十四日止，全省农民在四千二百七十多个农业生产合作社和四十多万个互助组的带动下，已排水补种了一千二百多万亩晚秋，新开垦四百四十多万亩荒地多半已经播种，在现有水、旱粮食田内间种、套种了三百七十多万亩泥豆、?豆、玉米等作物。此外还在七十二万亩休闲地里播种了晚秋作物。水稻产区的农民已提早收割两千万亩中稻，准备在百分之七十的稻田内培养一季“再生稻”。各地播种的晚秋作物已开始吐出嫩芽，生长良好。
