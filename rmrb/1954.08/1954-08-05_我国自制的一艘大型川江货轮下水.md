    China-Made Large River Freighter Launched
    On August 1st, China's first domestically made large river freighter, the "People's No. 1" freighter, was launched at the state-owned Hudong Shipyard fifteen days ahead of schedule. On that day, the factory's employees held a grand launching ceremony to celebrate the successful completion of the ship's hull construction.
    The "People's No. 1" freighter was designed by engineers from the joint public-private Minsheng Shipping Company. The ship is 81 meters long, 13.2 meters wide, with a total displacement of over 2,000 tons and a deadweight of 1,000 tons. When fully loaded, this freighter has a draft of only three meters. During the flood season on the Yangtze River, it can sail directly from Shanghai to Chongqing, and during the dry season, it can sail from Shanghai to Yichang. The freighter has a double-plated steel hull with several watertight and oil-tight compartments within the double hull. These compartments can increase the strength of the hull and can also be used to transport tung oil, a specialty product of Sichuan, Hunan, and other regions, when needed.
    Before liberation, the Hudong Shipyard was a small factory that could only repair ships. After liberation, it added some machinery and workers and began to build ships. The factory did not have a slipway for building such a large freighter, so the workers dredged the silt from the banks of the Huangpu River, built stone walls, and drove wooden piles to create a slipway to replace the original. Without higher cranes, the workers lengthened the existing crane booms by ten feet. The engine for this ship is a 1,000-horsepower triple expansion steam engine. The factory had never built such a steam engine before. This time, the factory's technicians and workers studied Soviet experience while strictly ensuring the quality of each part. Now the manufacturing of this steam engine is basically completed. The freighter is expected to be fully assembled by November. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 我国自制的一艘大型川江货轮下水

    我国自制的一艘大型川江货轮下水
    八月一日，我国自制的一艘大型的川江货轮——“人民一号”货轮，较计划提前十五天在国营沪东造船厂下水。当天，这个工厂职工举行了隆重的下水典礼，庆祝这艘大型货轮船体部分工程的胜利完工。
    “人民一号”货轮是公私合营民生轮船公司工程师设计的。船身长八十一公尺，宽十三点二公尺，总排水量为二千多吨，载重量为一千吨。这艘货轮全载重时吃水只有三公尺深，长江中洪水时期可以从上海直驶重庆，枯水时期也可以从上海驶到宜昌。这艘货轮有双层钢板的船底，在双层船底内有若干水密和油密的隔舱，这些隔舱可以增加船底的强度，也可以在需要时作载运四川、湖南等地特产桐油之用。
    沪东造船厂在解放前是一座仅能修补船只的小厂，解放后增加了一部分机器和工人，才开始制造轮船。这个厂没有制造这样大的货轮的船台，职工们就挖掉黄浦江边的淤泥，砌石头、打木桩造起斜坡来代替船台。没有更高的起重机，工人们就把现有的起重机吊杆接长了十尺。作这艘轮船的发动机是一千多匹马力的三联蒸汽机。这个厂从来没有制造过这样的蒸汽机。这次厂里技术人员和工人一边学习苏联经验，一边严格地做到保证每一零件的质量。现在这个蒸汽机的制造工作已基本完成。这艘货轮预计到十一月份可以全部装配好。（新华社）
