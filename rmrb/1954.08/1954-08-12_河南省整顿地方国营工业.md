Henan Province is Rectifying Local State-Owned Industries

Serious problems of low quality and high costs exist in the local state-owned industries of Henan Province. For example, over 80% of the ploughshares produced by the Yu'nan Iron Factory were rejects. The waterwheels produced by the Luoyang Farm Implement Factory once lost 480,000 yuan per unit. The Zhengzhou Cigarette Factory has received criticism from many consumers due to the poor quality of its cigarettes. The Northwest Monopoly Company's sales of Zhengzhou Cigarette Factory's cigarettes dropped from 800 cases to 400 cases. In order to reverse this situation, the Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry recently held a meeting to review the work of local industries and formulated a plan for rectifying local state-owned industries, deciding to strengthen technical management, improve product quality, and prepare to adjust some local state-owned factories. The Zhengzhou Machinery Factory will be converted into a small hardware manufacturing factory to produce urgently needed small hardware; the Luoyang Farm Implement Factory will be converted into the Luoyang Repair Factory to support the basic construction of Luoyang; the Jiaozuo Machine Factory and the Shangqiu Machinery Factory will manufacture waterwheels and walking plows; and the Yu'nan Machinery Factory and the Xingyang Machinery Factory will be merged into a tractor repair factory to serve agricultural tractor stations.

    河南省整顿地方国营工业
    在河南省地方国营工业中，严重地存在着质量低、成本高的现象。如豫南铁工厂制造的犁尖，出现过百分之八十以上的废品；洛阳农具厂出产的水车每部曾亏本四十八万元；郑州烟厂因产纸烟质量不好受到许多消费者的批评，西北专卖公司销售郑州烟厂的纸烟由八百箱降至四百箱。为了扭转这种情况 ，河南省人民政府工业厅最近召开会议，检查了地方工业的工作，拟定了关于整顿地方国营工业的方案，决定加强技术管理、提高产品质量，并准备调整一些地方国营的工厂。郑州机械厂将改为小五金器材制造厂，生产迫切需要的小五金器材；洛阳农具厂将改为洛阳修配厂，以支援洛阳的基本建设；焦作机器厂、商邱机械厂将制造水车和步犁，豫南机械厂和荥阳机械厂将合并为拖拉机修配厂，为农业拖拉机站服务。　（本报河南记者站）
