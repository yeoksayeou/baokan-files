Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 11th: According to a statement released to the press by the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said on the 10th that Indonesia will not participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and will not send observers to meetings discussing the establishment of the Southeast Asia Group.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo made the statement in response to a United Press International (UPI) report that Indonesia was considering sending observers to the meeting to discuss the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The Indonesian Prime Minister said that the UPI report was completely untrue.

Indonesian Minister of Information Tobing told reporters on the 10th that Indonesia is not interested in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Indonesia will not participate in the proposed organization (regardless of its form) and therefore will not send observers to meetings on the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: TASS, Jakarta, August 10th: Indonesian newspapers reported on the 10th that Runturuno, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Indonesian Parliament, emphasized in a speech that Indonesia would not participate in the US-proposed Southeast Asian alliance. He said, "Let everyone know that we will not participate in the struggle against so-called communist aggression. Indonesia will steadfastly pursue an independent policy."

Expressing the opinion of the majority of members of parliament, Runturuno expressed his indignation at the Dutch attempt to place West Irian under the control of this alliance, and he emphasized: "Indonesia will not adopt a passive attitude towards such actions by the Netherlands."

Runturuno warned the imperialist countries that Indonesia would receive strong support from the people of Asia in its struggle for the complete abolition of colonial rule.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 11th: The Indian "Free Press" published an editorial on the 9th, condemning Dulles' new conspiracy to sabotage Asian peace. The editorial said that Dulles has openly talked about placing Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam under the protection of the Southeast Asian military bloc. This shows that he wants to violate the Indochina armistice agreement, which clearly stipulates that none of the three Indochinese countries can participate in any military bloc. But Dulles is precisely trying to violate this provision in the agreement. Not only that, but Dulles has also put forward a plan to organize mutually hostile groups to make Asians fight Asians.

The editorial pointed out that it is not difficult to understand that American imperialists are now desperately trying to create an atmosphere of war in Southeast Asia. American warmongers are frantically trying to undermine the atmosphere of peace created by the Five Principles in the joint statement by Zhou Enlai and Nehru and the achievements of the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue. They are also trying to counter the Five Principles listed in the joint statement by Zhou Enlai and Nehru by organizing war blocs.

The editorial concluded by saying: That is why every good Indian must now be vigilant against American war plans; and must defeat the conspiracy to create an atmosphere of war in Asia by creating a universal atmosphere of peace. Implementing the Five Principles in the joint statement by Zhou Enlai and Nehru can create this atmosphere of peace.

    印尼总理声明不参加关于东南亚集团的会议
    印度“自由报”发表社论谴责杜勒斯破坏亚洲和平的新阴谋
    【新华社雅加达十一日电】据印尼外交部向报界发表的声明说，沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理十日说，印尼将不参加东南亚公约组织并且不会派观察员出席讨论成立东南亚集团问题的会议。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理发表谈话，是因为合众社发表消息说，印尼正在考虑派观察员参加讨论成立东南亚公约组织的问题的会议。印尼总理说，合众社的消息是完全不真实的。
    印尼情报部长杜斌十日对记者们说，印尼对东南亚公约组织不感兴趣。印尼将不参加建议中的组织（不论它采取什么形式），因而将不派观察员参加关于东南亚公约组织的会议。
   【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社雅加达十日讯：印尼报纸十日报道，印尼国会外交小组委员会主席伦度诺乌在一次谈话中强调说，印尼将不参加美国拟议的东南亚联盟。他说，让每一个人都知道，“我们将不参加反对所谓共产党侵略的斗争。印尼将坚定不移地奉行独立的政策”。
    伦度诺乌表示了国会多数议员的意见，他对荷兰企图把西伊里安置于这个联盟控制之下的意图表示愤慨，他强调说：“印尼将不对荷兰的这种行径采取消极态度。”
    伦度诺乌警告帝国主义国家说，印尼在它争取完全废除殖民统治的斗争中，一定会得到亚洲人民的大力支持。
   【新华社新德里十一日电】印度“自由报”九日发表社论，谴责杜勒斯破坏亚洲和平的新阴谋。社论说，杜勒斯已经公开谈论要把老挝、柬埔寨和越南南部置于东南亚军事集团的保护之下。这表明他要违反印度支那停战协议。在协议中清楚地规定，三个印度支那国家中的任何一国都不能参加任何军事集团。可是杜勒斯恰恰要违反协议中的这一规定。不仅如此，杜勒斯还已经提出一个计划，要组织彼此敌对的集团，使亚洲人打亚洲人。
    社论指出，不难理解，美帝国主义者现在正拚命地设法在东南亚制造战争气氛。美国战争贩子们正在疯狂地设法破坏由周恩来和尼赫鲁的联合声明里的五项原则和日内瓦会议在印度支那问题上获得的成就所造成的和平气氛。他们也在设法以组织战争集团的方法来对抗周恩来和尼赫鲁联合声明中所列举的五项原则。
    社论在最后说：这就是为什么现在每个善良的印度人必须对于美国的战争计划保持警惕；并且必须以创造普遍的和平气氛来击败在亚洲制造战争气氛的阴谋。实行周恩来和尼赫鲁的联合声明里的五项原则就能创造这种和平气氛。
