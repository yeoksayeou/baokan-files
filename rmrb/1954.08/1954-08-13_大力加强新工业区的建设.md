    Vigorously Strengthen the Construction of New Industrial Zones

    The key construction projects, with 141 projects as the main focus, are the core of our country's first five-year plan. Some of these key projects involve renovating, expanding, and building new facilities in existing industrial cities; however, more projects will be built near cities that previously lacked modern large-scale industry. These newly built enterprises will not only play a decisive role in ensuring the speed of our country's industrial development and initially laying the foundation for our industrialization, but will also greatly change the unreasonable distribution of productive forces in old China, and more effectively unleash the potential of various aspects of the national economy.

    Currently, the sites for these newly built enterprises have been determined, and the preliminary designs for the factories, commissioned to the Soviet Union, have been successively completed. Various construction units are working intensively to collect various data for these designs, and huge preparatory work is underway.

    Among all the preparatory work, doing a good job in the survey, design, and construction preparation of off-site facilities in the new industrial zones is an extremely important component. This is a very complex technical and organizational task, requiring close cooperation and consistent work from all parties. We know that an industrial zone is an integrated whole composed of many enterprises. These many enterprises are not simply pieced together in isolation. There are close relationships between each enterprise and even between the entire industrial zone and the city. Many things need to be planned and arranged in a unified way, and close cooperation is needed from all parties. For example, where will the large amount of purified water needed by this industrial zone every day be obtained, where will the large amount of used wastewater be discharged, how will electricity, heat, and gas be supplied, how will the complex and crisscrossing underground pipelines for water supply, drainage, cables, steam, and gas be arranged, how will communication networks such as telegraph, telephone, and broadcasting be set up, where will railways, roads, docks, and stations be built, how will dormitories, hospitals, schools, cooperatives, public security police stations, and other public utilities be coordinated... This series of issues requires careful and meticulous planning. Moreover, the design and construction time of each project must be closely linked. If some parts are not well coordinated, not timely, or if the economic benefits are not thoroughly calculated, the result will either be a delay in the construction time of the entire industrial zone, causing difficulties in construction and production, or it will cause huge waste, leaving the industrial zone in an unreasonable state for a long time after completion.

    In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of this part of the work, urban construction committees have now been established in various relevant cities, and the departments in charge of the main enterprises of this region in the future have been designated as the general persons in charge of off-site facilities - namely, the "general client". Various relevant departments have also taken on the design and construction tasks of their respective specialized projects, such as the Ministry of Railways being responsible for dedicated railway lines, and the Ministry of Construction Engineering being responsible for water supply and drainage and residential projects, etc. Recognizing the importance of this work, the various units participating in the construction of these new industrial cities have generally taken on very heavy tasks.

    However, our country has never carried out planned industrial construction in the past. Now, it is not without difficulties to build many new industrial zones from scratch all at once, and to correspondingly transform many old and backward consumer cities into new socialist industrial cities. This is because our construction experience and technical cadres are extremely lacking. Moreover, our country has just entered a period of planned construction, and all aspects of work are starting and progressing at the same time, which makes the time very tight and greatly increases the difficulties in the work. In addition, at the beginning, we did not fully recognize the complexity of off-site facilities and new urban construction work, and we did not concentrate and organize the existing technical forces in a timely and effective manner. Some units also emphasized difficulties in coordination and cooperation, and were not proactive, showing more or less departmentalism, resulting in the construction preparation work of many off-site facilities not being carried out according to plan, and being in a very backward state, far from meeting the needs of factory construction.

    In order to rapidly strengthen this aspect of work and strive to catch up with the needs of industrial construction, we must continue to take the following organizational measures. For example, drawing a large number of technical personnel from various cities across the country to support these new industrial cities, in order to strengthen these most important and weakest links. Establishing and improving various specialized survey and design institutions in various relevant departments, such as engineering geological survey institutions, as well as design institutions for water supply and drainage, heating pipelines, industrial railways, urban planning and civil residences, etc., to undertake various complex survey and design tasks. The general clients of various new industrial zones should take the initiative to contact relevant units, seize the time to sign contracts, and ensure the completion of various construction requirements on schedule. The urban construction committees of various new industrial cities should further strengthen the unified leadership of the construction of new industrial zones, and under the overall planning and arrangement, actively organize various units to cooperate and work together, and strive to make the construction preparation work of all off-site facilities proceed in an orderly and organized manner... As long as all relevant cities and departments spare no effort to strengthen the leadership of the construction work of new industrial zones from all aspects, we will be able to strive to gradually reverse the backward situation of off-site facilities in a relatively short period of time, and ensure that the construction of various key projects can proceed smoothly according to the planned progress.

    In addition to these organizational measures, in order to ensure that this major construction task can be completed on time and without error, it is also necessary to strengthen ideological education work and carry out criticism and self-criticism, and establish a strong sense of time and a spirit of active cooperation and collaboration among all those who participate in the construction work of these new industrial cities. This is an important responsibility of the party organizations in various relevant cities, relevant departments, and all construction units. In particular, party members who hold administrative leadership positions in these party organizations should take the lead and set an example for the masses.

    The reason why we want to especially emphasize the concept of time is because the various key projects being built in these new industrial cities are modern enterprises with large production capacities. The earlier these enterprises are put into production, the more than hundreds of millions of yuan of value can be created. More importantly, most of them are heavy industry enterprises that manufacture means of production. If the construction of these enterprises is delayed, not only will the industrial development speed of the first five-year plan be affected, but the speed of industrialization and the technical transformation of agriculture, transportation, light industry will also be affected. Therefore, various party organizations must take striving for time and ensuring speed as the main content of their ideological and political work, and mobilize as many people as possible to participate in this struggle. Of course, the prerequisite for striving for time is to ensure the quality of work. If we act rashly, do not conduct economic and technical research and comparison of various solutions, or even win time by cutting corners and shoddy workmanship, the consequences will either be rework and waste more time, or cause long-term unreasonableness after the completion of the new industrial zone, resulting in irreparable losses. This tendency must be constantly vigilant and prevented.

    The reason why we particularly emphasize the spirit of collaboration is because this work is highly comprehensive. In all projects, there is almost no project that can be carried out in isolation without being related to other units. Many tasks are interdependent and conditional on each other. At the same time, all units participating in this work have difficulties in lacking experience and insufficient manpower. Moreover, the overall organization and leadership are not strong enough at present, and there are many unclear divisions of labor and unclear responsibilities. In this case, it is even easier to breed the mood of being passive and retreating in the face of difficulties, waiting for each other, relying on superiors and others to solve problems for oneself, or not being proactive in consultation and division of labor, taking the attitude of "pushing out as much as possible", which increases the difficulties in cooperation and delays the progress of construction. Therefore, when strengthening ideological leadership, various party organizations should pay special attention to conducting in-depth education and adhering to principled struggle on this issue, encourage everyone to give play to their initiative and the spirit of helping each other to overcome difficulties, start from the overall situation in everything and think more about other units. In this way, although the task is very complex and arduous, the collective strength that is very closely united can reduce the difficulties on our road forward and accelerate the progress of construction.

    A batch of new heavy industrial enterprises, new industrial zones, and new industrial cities will be established on the land of our country in the next few years. This great cause inspires the people of the whole country; and the expectations, trust, and support of the people of the whole country will add infinite confidence and strength to these glorious builders. We believe that with the efforts of all construction workers, the backward situation of off-site supporting projects will not last long, and news of victory will continue to come.

### 大力加强新工业区的建设

    大力加强新工业区的建设
    以一百四十一项工程为主的重点建设工程，是我国第一个五年建设的中心。这些重点工程有一些是在原有的工业城市中改建、扩建和新建的；而更多的工程则将在原来没有近代大工业的城市附近建设起来。这些新建企业不仅对保证我国工业发展的速度，初步奠定我国工业化基础有着决定的作用，而且将大大改变旧中国生产力分布不合理的状况，更有效地发挥国民经济各方面的潜力。
    现在这些新建企业的厂址都已确定，委托苏联代我们编制的工厂初步设计已经陆续完成，各个建设单位正在紧张地为这些设计继续搜集各种资料，巨大的准备工作正在进行着。
    在全部准备工作中间，作好新工业区中厂外工程的勘察设计和建设准备，是一个极为重要的组成部分。这是一件很复杂的技术工作和组织工作，需要各方面紧密配合协作一致的工作。我们知道，一个工业区是由很多个企业组成的整体。这许多企业并不是各自孤立地拼凑在一起，各个企业之间以至整个工业区与城市之间，有着密切的关联，有很多事情需要作统一的筹划和布置，需要各方面密切配合。例如，这个工业区每天需要用的大量净水由哪里取得，用过的大量污水向哪里排泄，电力、热力、煤气如何供应，上水、下水、电缆、蒸气、煤气等各种复杂交错的地下管道如何安排，电报、电话、广播等通讯网如何设置，铁路、公路、码头、车站修筑在什么地方，宿舍、医院、学校、合作社、公安派出所、以及其他公用事业怎样配合……这一系列的问题都需要作周密细致的筹划，而且，其中每一件工程在设计和施工的时间上都必须紧密衔接，如果其中有一部分配合得不好，不及时，或者不周密地计算经济效果，其结果不是延误整个工业区的建设时间，造成建设和生产中的困难，就是造成巨大的浪费，使工业区建成后长期陷于不合理的状态。
    为了加强这部分工作的组织领导，现在各个有关城市都成立了城市建设委员会，各个工业区都推定了这个区域中未来的主要企业的主管部门担任厂外工程的总负责人——即“总甲方”，各个有关部门也都分工担承了自己所专长的工程的设计和施工任务，如铁道部负责铁路专用线，建筑工程部负责上下水道和住宅工程等等。由于认识到这项工作的重要意义，参加这些新工业城市建设工作的各个单位，一般的都积极地担负起了很繁重的任务。
    但是，我国过去从来没有进行过有计划的工业建设，现在要从平地上一下子建立起来许多个新工业区，并且要相应地把许多个古老落后的消费城市变为新型的社会主义工业城市不是没有困难的。因为我们的建设经验和技术干部，都是十分地缺乏。而且我国刚刚进入有计划建设的时期，各方面的工作都是一齐开始，齐头并进，就更使得时间十分紧促，大大加重了工作中的困难。再加上开始时期我们对厂外工程和新城市建设工作的复杂性认识不足，对现有的技术力量也没有及时地集中和很好地组织起来，有些单位在配合协作上又强调困难，不积极主动，表现了或多或少的本位主义思想，结果就使得目前厂外工程的建设准备工作很多都不能按照计划进行，处于十分落后的状态，远不能适应工厂建设的需要。
    为了急速加强这方面的工作，争取赶上工业建设的需要，我们必须继续采取下列的一些组织措施。例如从全国各个城市中抽调大批的技术力量来支援这些新工业城市，以加强这些最重要而又最薄弱的环节。在各个有关部门中建立和健全各种专业的勘察设计机构，如工程地质勘察机构以及给水排水、供热管道、工业铁道、城市规划与民用住宅的设计机构等，以担任各种复杂的勘察设计任务。各个新工业区的总甲方要主动与有关单位联系，抓紧时间签订合同，保证按期完成各项建设要求。各个新工业城市的城市建设委员会要进一步加强对新工业区建设的统一领导，在总的规划布置下，积极组织各单位配合协作，努力使全部厂外工程的建设准备工作有秩序有组织地进行……。只要所有有关的城市和部门都不遗余力地从各方面来加强对新工业区建设工作的领导，我们就有可能争取在比较短的时期内逐步扭转厂外工程的落后状况，保证各个重点工程的建设能够按照预定的进度顺利进行。
    除了这些组织上的措施之外，为了保证这个重大的建设任务能够准时无误地完成，还必须加强思想教育工作和开展批评与自我批评，在所有参加这些新工业城市建设工作的人们中间树立强烈的时间观念和积极配合协作的精神。这是各个有关城市、有关部门和所有建设单位中党组织的重要责任，特别是这些党组织中担负行政领导职务的党员更应该身体力行，作群众的表率。
    我们所以要特别强调时间观念，是因为在这些新工业城市中兴建的各个重点工程，都是生产能力很大的近代化的企业。这些企业早投入生产一天，不仅可以多创造亿万元的价值，而更重要的是它们大多是制造生产资料的重工业企业，这些企业的建设推迟了，将不只是第一个五年计划的工业发展速度要受到影响，整个工业化的速度和农业、交通运输业、轻工业的技术改造都要连带受到影响。因此，各个党组织必须把争取时间保证速度作为自己思想政治工作的主要内容，发动尽量多的群众来参加这个斗争。当然，争取时间的前提条件是必须保证工作的质量。如果草率从事，对各种方案，不作经济和技术的研究和比较，甚至用偷工减料、粗制滥造的办法赢得了时间，其后果不是返工重做，浪费了更多的时间，就是造成新工业区建成后长期的不合理，造成无可挽回的损失。这种偏向必须时时警惕，注意防止。
    我们所以特别强调协作精神，是因为这项工作具有高度的综合性，在全部工程中几乎没有一个项目可以孤立地进行而不与其他单位发生关系，有很多工作都是互相依存、互为条件的；而所有参加这件工作的单位，又都存在着没有经验和人力不足的困难；同时，目前整个的组织领导还不够坚强，有许多工作分工不清、责任不明。在这种情况下，就更易滋长在困难面前消极退缩，互相等待，依赖上级和别人来替自己解决问题的情绪，或者在协商分工时不积极主动，采取“尽可能推出去”的态度，以致增加了配合协作中的困难，耽搁了建设的进度。因此，各个党组织在加强思想领导的时候，特别要注意在这个问题上进行深入的教育和坚持原则斗争，要鼓舞大家发挥主动性和相互协助克服困难的精神，事事从全局出发和多为其他单位着想，这样，任务虽然是十分复杂艰巨，但团结得很紧密的集体力量将可以减轻我们前进道路上的困难，加速建设的进度。
    一批新的重工业企业，新的工业区，新的工业城市将在今后若干年内在我国的大地上建立起来。这个伟大的事业鼓舞着全国人民；而全国人民的期望、信任和支持，又将给这些光荣的建设者们增加无限的信心和力量。我们相信，在全体建设工作者的努力下，厂外配合工程落后的局面不会再持续很久，而胜利的消息将会不断传来。
