Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Prague newspapers on July 25 carried the statement of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic regarding the Geneva Conference.

The statement said: The government and people of Czechoslovakia warmly welcome the news that the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference concluded on July 21 with the signing of the agreement on restoring peace in Indochina.

The statement said that the unwavering peaceful policies of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China promoted the successful conclusion of the Geneva Conference. Those who attempted to undermine the Geneva Conference were isolated.

The French government's position at the Geneva Conference contributed to reaching an agreement that conformed to the wishes of the French people, who sincerely hoped to end this war that violated their vital interests and their tradition of love for freedom. The rights of the Indochinese people to national independence and democratic freedom have been recognized. They waged a heroic struggle to win this right. The outcome of the Geneva Conference proves that the historical changes caused by the Asian national liberation movement cannot be ignored. This movement has become one of the decisive factors in world history.

The Geneva Conference proved that it is impossible to solve the most important international issues without the participation of the largest country in Asia—the People's Republic of China. China's consistent peaceful policy and the agreements reached in Geneva have immeasurably increased its international prestige. Therefore, the demand to restore the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations must be fulfilled.

The statement said that the Czechoslovak people believe that it is absolutely necessary to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and to establish a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany.

The Czechoslovak government is convinced that signing the all-European treaty on collective security in Europe proposed by V.M. Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, at the Berlin Conference is an important factor in consolidating universal peace and guaranteeing the peaceful and happy future of Czechoslovakia.

The statement concluded by saying that the Czechoslovak government, faithful to its peaceful policy, declares that it will continue to strive to resolve international disputes, the solution of which is of great significance for the peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation of all countries.

Also, the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria issued a statement on the Geneva Conference on the 29th.

The statement said that the Bulgarian people have always followed with deep sympathy the self-sacrificing and heroic struggle of the Indochinese people for freedom and national independence. They sincerely hope that the Indochinese people will consolidate their achievements and realize the unification of Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Agreement and their national interests. The great significance of the Geneva Conference lies not only in the restoration of peace in Indochina, but also in marking a great victory for the forces of peace and a heavy defeat for the forces of aggression.

The outcome of the conference convincingly shows how important the participation of the People's Republic of China is in solving international problems. The entry of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations, as well as the entry of our country and other peace-loving countries still outside the United Nations, will greatly help to peacefully resolve all international disputes and ease international tensions.

The statement said that the Geneva Conference showed that it is entirely possible to resolve the Korean issue peacefully, but some delegations at the conference, especially the US delegation, undermined the solution of this issue. The Geneva Conference also convincingly demonstrated the possibility of resolving the German issue, which has been awaiting resolution for many years, on a peaceful basis.

The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria fully and unconditionally supports the Soviet government's proposal to establish a European collective security system and convene a conference of all European countries willing to participate.

The statement concluded by saying that the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria has consistently adhered to a policy of peace and friendly cooperation with all countries, and it stated that it will continue to be committed to resolving disputes through negotiations and to do its part to establish lasting and consolidated peace in Europe and the world.

Also, according to the Romanian News Agency Bucharest on July 31, the Government of the Romanian People's Republic issued a statement on the results of the Geneva Conference.

The statement congratulated Indochina on the restoration of peace and the victory of the Indochinese people in the struggle for peace, freedom, and national independence.

The statement pointed out that the Geneva Conference proved how necessary and useful it is to recognize the right of the People's Republic of China as a member of the United Nations and to recognize the important role of the great Chinese people in resolving international issues and consolidating world peace. The policy adopted by the United States towards the great People's Republic of China is a policy that undermines peace and is completely contrary to the fundamental interests of humanity. In view of the results of the Geneva Conference, it is obvious that the discriminatory policy pursued by the United States in its international policy should be stopped, as a result of which many countries are excluded from the United Nations, including the Romanian People's Republic.

The statement said: The results of the Geneva Conference help to ease international tensions and create new possibilities for actively resolving outstanding issues. The possibility of establishing a European collective security system and resolving the German issue on a peaceful and democratic basis is increasing. On this issue, the Soviet government's note of July 24 to the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States is a step of great importance. The Government of the Romanian People's Republic expresses its full support for this proposal, and it is convinced that the implementation of this proposal will help to strengthen world peace.

The statement concluded by saying that the Government of the Romanian People's Republic declares that it continues to resolutely follow the path of international cooperation and will continue to spare no effort to devote itself to the cause of easing international tensions, maintaining collective security, and consolidating peace.

    捷、保、罗三国政府
    发表关于日内瓦会议的声明
    据新华社讯：七月二十五日布拉格各报刊载了
  捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府关于日内瓦会议的声明。
    声明说：捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民热烈欢迎关于日内瓦外长会议以在七月二十一日签订关于恢复
  印度支那和平的协定为结束的消息。
    声明说，苏联和中华人民共和国的坚持不渝的
  和平政策促进了日内瓦会议的胜利结束。那些企图破坏日内瓦会议的人陷于孤立。
    法国政府在日内瓦会议的立场有助于达成符合法国人民的愿望的协定，法国人民是真诚希望结束这一场违反他们的切身利益和他们的爱好自由的传统的战争的。印度支那人民的民族独立和民主自由的权利已被承认，他们曾为争取这一权利进行了英勇的斗争，日内瓦会议的结果证明，亚洲民族解放
  运动所引起的历史变化已是不容忽视的了。这一运动已成为世界历史中具有决定性的因素之一。
    日内瓦会议证明，没有亚洲最大的国家——中华人民共和国参加，就不可能解决最重要的国际问题。中国的一贯的和平政策和在日内瓦达成的协议使它的国际威信难以估量地提高了。因此，必须履行恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位的要求。
    声明说，捷克斯洛伐克人民认为，缔结对德和约和建立一个统一、民主、和平的德国是十分必要的。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府深信，签订苏联部长会议第
  一副主席兼外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫在柏林会议上建议的保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约，就是巩固普遍和平和保障捷克斯洛伐克未来的和平和幸福的重要因素。
    声明最后说，忠实于自己的和平政策的捷克斯洛伐克政府宣布：今后它仍旧要竭力促使国际争端得到解决，这些问题的解决对各国人民的和平共处和友好合作有十分重大的意义。
    又讯：保加利亚人民共和国政府二十九日发表了关于日内瓦会议的声明。
    声明说，保加利亚人民一向以深切的同情注视着印度支那人民为自由和民族独立而进行自我牺牲和英勇的奋斗，他们衷心地希望印度支那人民巩固已取得的胜利，希望他们能根据日内瓦协定和他们的民族利益来实现越南全国的统一。日内瓦会议的重大意义，不仅在于印度支那和平的恢复，它还标志着和平力量的巨大胜利和侵略势力的惨重失败。
    会议的结果极为令人信服地表明，中华人民共和国参加国际问题的解决有着多么重大的意义。中华人民共和国进入联合国，以及我国和其他尚在联合国以外的爱好和平的国家进入联合国将大大有助于和平解决一切国际争端，有助于缓和国际紧张局势。
    声明说，日内瓦会议表明，要和平解决朝鲜问题是完全可能的，而会上的某些代表团，首先是美国代表团破坏了这一问题的解决。日内瓦会议也还极为令人信服地表明了要在和平的基础上解决多年来一直等待解决的德国问题的可能性。
    保加利亚人民共和国政府完全地、无条件地支持苏联政府的建议：建立欧洲集体安全体系，召开一切愿意参加会议的欧洲国家的会议。
    声明最后说，保加利亚人民共和国政府一贯坚持和平和与各国人民友好合作的政策，它表示，今后仍将致力于通过谈判来解决争端，为确立欧洲和全世界持久与巩固的和平尽其一分力量。
    又讯：据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特七月三十一日讯：罗马尼亚人民共和国政府就日内瓦会议的结果发表声明。
    声明祝贺印度支那恢复和平和印度支那人民在争取和平、自由和民族独立的斗争中所获得的胜利。
    声明指出，日内瓦会议证明，承认中华人民共和国作为联合国组织的一个成员国的权利和承认伟大的中国人民在解决国际问题以及巩固全世界和平方面的重要作用是多么必要和有用。美国对伟大的中华人民共和国所采取的政策是破坏和平的、完全和人类的基本利益相矛盾的政策。鉴于日内瓦会议的结果，显然应当制止美国在它的国际政策中所推行的歧视政策，由于这种政策，许多国家被排斥在联合国组织之外，罗马尼亚人民共和国也是这些国家当中的一个。
    声明说：日内瓦会议的结果有助于国际紧张局势的缓和，创造了积极地解决悬而未决的问题的新的可能性。建立一个欧洲集体安全体系以及在和平、民主的基础上解决德国问题的可能性越来越大了。在这个问题上，苏联政府七月二十四日致法国、英国和美国政府的照会是一个具有巨大重要性的步骤。罗马尼亚人民共和国政府对这个建议表示完全赞同，它坚信这个建议的付诸实现是有助于加强全世界和平的。
    声明最后说：罗马尼亚人民共和国政府宣布，它继续坚决遵循国际合作的道路，今后仍将不遗余力地致力于缓和国际紧张局势的事业、维护集体安全和巩固和平。
