Rapeseed and flax are the main oil crops of Gansu Province. The rapeseed harvest is now largely complete, with generally good yields. Flax is growing vigorously, and harvesting will begin soon in some areas.

The province sowed over 500,000 mu of rapeseed this year. The harvest in Wudu, Pingliang, Qingyang and other regions is now complete, with generally good yields. In Pingliang region, the 100,000+ mu of rapeseed sown achieved an average yield of 71 jin per mu; Qingyang region also achieved an average yield of over 70 jin per mu; Wudu county achieved an average yield of 200 jin per mu, more than double last year's yield. In Linxia region, rapeseed plants growing along the Taizi Mountain are about one person tall, with an estimated average yield of around 100 jin per mu.

Flax is generally growing well. The 400,000+ mu of flax in the Xihai Gu region is growing vigorously due to abundant rainfall. Flax is also growing well in the 300,000+ mu of irrigated land in the Hexi region, as well as in Tianshui, Dingxi and other regions.

    甘肃省菜籽丰收
    菜籽和胡麻是甘肃省的主要油料作物，现在，菜籽已大部收割完毕，收成普遍良好。胡麻生长茁壮，有些地区也将要开始收割。
    甘肃全省今年共播种菜籽五十多万亩。现在，武都、平凉、庆阳等专区已收割完毕，一般收成良好。平凉专区播种的十万多亩菜籽，每亩平均产量达七十一斤；庆阳专区每亩平均产量也在七十斤以上；武都县每亩平均产量达二百斤，比去年提高一倍以上。临夏专区沿太子山一带菜籽生长约有一人多高，估计每亩平均产量在一百斤左右。
    该省胡麻普遍生长良好，西海固地区的四十多万亩胡麻，由于雨水充足生长茁壮。河西灌溉区的三十多万亩胡麻，和天水、定西专区等地胡麻生长情况也很好。
