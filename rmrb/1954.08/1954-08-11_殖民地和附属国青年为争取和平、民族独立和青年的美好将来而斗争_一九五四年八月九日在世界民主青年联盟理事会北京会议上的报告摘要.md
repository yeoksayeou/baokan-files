    Colonial and Dependent Countries' Youth Struggle for Peace, National Independence and a Better Future for Youth
    --Summary of the Report at the Beijing Meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council on August 9, 1954
    By Brenno Bernini, President of the World Federation of Democratic Youth

    Dear Friends:

    Today, millions upon millions of young people still live in the inhuman conditions of being enslaved by colonialism. Almost half of the world's population (44 percent) lives in colonies and dependent countries. Since the victory of the anti-fascist war, the struggle of the colonial peoples to liberate their countries from oppression and to prosper in peaceful labor has grown stronger and more invincible year by year, month by month, day by day. Never in human history has there been such a large-scale movement. The people of some entire countries have been liberated from the shackles of the colonial system and have gained complete independence. The people of other countries have resolutely embarked on the road of national liberation. The foundations of the colonial system have been shaken. The founding of the People's Republic of China has shaken the entire colonial world, and the great victories of the Korean and Vietnamese peoples against the aggressors are also of great historical significance.

    The rapid awakening of the people of colonial and dependent countries, and their heroic struggle for the sacred rights of independence and equality, make an ever-greater and immeasurable contribution to the common cause of all mankind in striving for world peace and progress. Youth are struggling at the forefront of this powerful movement.

      (I)

    All those participating in this Council meeting are very well aware of the inhuman poverty that colonialism has brought to a large part of the world's people and youth. Some of the participants in the meeting have personally experienced this suffering.

    Everyone knows that these countries possess enormous natural resources and the most fertile and vast lands in the world.

    All of these riches have been seized by the colonialists. The youth and people of these countries cannot utilize these riches. On the contrary, the colonialists are constantly strengthening their exploitation of the people and youth of these countries, deepening their poverty day by day. Unemployment, poverty, and hunger are increasing year by year, month by month. These inhuman living conditions are intolerable to all mankind.

    Millions of residents in colonies and dependent countries are deprived of the most basic human rights, the right to work, and in practice, the right to live.

    Increasing unemployment, meager wages, intolerable hunger and poverty, lack of sanitary housing, almost complete lack of medical treatment, and inadequate sanitation, all contribute to the short lifespan of youth and people. Especially in South Africa, the mortality rate of the local people has almost doubled from 1938 to the present, twenty times higher than the mortality rate in Europe. According to United Nations statistics, the average life expectancy of Indians is 26 years, and in some areas of Brazil, it is 28 years. This shows how terrible the mortality rate of children and young people is.

    The colonial system uses every means to destroy national culture. In all colonies and dependent countries, almost universal illiteracy has become a system. The right to learn in one's own language is ignored and often forbidden. In Algeria, 85 percent of the population is Arab, but under French colonial rule, Arabic is treated as a foreign language, while French is forcibly made the statutory language. However, even studying in French is considered dangerous by the French colonialists, because it would enable the youth to understand things that the colonialists do not want them to understand.

    The most basic political rights of the colonial people and youth are almost universally deprived or restricted. In almost all countries, youth suffer from racial discrimination from childhood, which follows them throughout their lives, becoming a great misfortune.

    In addition, there are the killings and atrocities suffered by these people: they are subjected to police repression and persecution, which violates all, even the most basic, rights to personal freedom. These barbarous ways of violating the most basic rights to personal freedom can still be found in many countries. Take South Africa as an example, where black people have been deprived of their land and forced to live in "designated areas" or "special areas," they cannot go out or travel freely; without special permission, they cannot stay outside after 10 p.m., otherwise they will be arrested or punished with forced labor on the colonialists' estates.

    In colonies and dependent countries, there exists an open dictatorship of colonial rule; the people's freedom to establish their own organizations and decide their own destiny is trampled upon. Recently, the colonialists, seeing the people's rising determination to strive for complete freedom and independence, have recognized that it is impossible to maintain their rule by the old methods. They are now adopting new and more subtle methods of colonial enslavement.

    In South Africa, it is said that some kind of independence has been granted, but according to the constitution, only white people have the right to be elected, and white people only account for one-fifth of the total population. Only 4 percent of the local indigenous people have the right to vote.

    The Philippines obtained an "Independence Charter" as early as 1946, but the United States retained 23 of the most important naval and military bases there. In 1950, through a policy of division and war, the United States acquired new territories in the Philippines, so that it had a total of 35 military bases, and in fact still maintained an open system of military occupation on Philippine territory.

    When the people of colonies, semi-colonies, and dependent countries disagree with the existing system and strive for the basic right of national independence, the hideous face of the colonialists is clearly exposed. Then persecution, terror, mass imprisonment, and massacres begin.

    Not long ago, we and all of humanity witnessed the aggression suffered by the people of the small country of Guatemala. The people of Guatemala, who merely wanted to limit the control of the powerful American monopoly capital "United Fruit Company" which, like an octopus, extended its arms to the entire Central American economic sector, were attacked, and the entire national life of their country was destroyed. The government freely chosen by the people of Guatemala was violently overthrown. Terror enveloped the entire country, the peasants' land was taken away again, and the electoral law was changed. Seventy-five percent of the country's population was deprived of the right to vote; trade unions and youth organizations were dissolved, and hundreds and thousands of young people and free citizens were imprisoned and killed.

    It is not difficult to understand why the colonialists adopt the most barbaric methods to try to suppress all actions aimed at national independence. This is because they want to carry out unlimited and unrestrained plunder and exploitation of the people of colonies and dependent countries. The economic enslavement of these people brings terrible disasters to the local people, but fills the private pockets of the colonialists. They plunder everything from the people of colonies and dependent countries: land, minerals, and raw materials.

    For example, in Central America, the American monopolistic capital "United Fruit Company" controls 2.5 million hectares of the most fertile land; in Malaya, three-quarters of the land producing rubber is the property of British companies; in Algeria, French colonial companies occupy 55 percent of the arable land.

    Underground resources are one of the most important foundations for the development of all modern economies, and these resources are in the hands of foreign companies: for example, zinc in Burma, oil in Saudi Arabia and Iran, gold in the Gold Coast and the Belgian Congo, and copper in Rhodesia. In Latin America, the colonialists control 80 percent of oil production; the North American monopolistic capital "United States Steel Corporation" and "Bethlehem Steel Corporation" monopolize all iron ore mining sites, and the American monopolistic capital completely controls copper mining.

    Agriculture is still the main occupation of the majority of the local population, and the control of agriculture by the colonialists means preserving feudal modes of production, establishing large-scale deep-plowing single-crop plantations, forcing agricultural production to develop only in a single direction; it means developing various raw materials regardless of the most basic interests and needs of the local people.

    In recent years, great changes have taken place in the colonial system. Some colonialists have inherited others. The power of British, French, Dutch, and Belgian colonialists is shrinking year by year, but at the same time, the power of American monopoly capital in colonial countries is expanding day by day. Taking the situation in the Middle East as an example, in the Middle East's oil production, the United States only accounted for 17 percent in 1946, but reached 59 percent in 1952, while Britain fell from 76 percent to 33 percent during the same period.

    The rise of the new colonialists has caused even larger-scale plunder and more cruel exploitation. The greatest characteristic of the American colonialists' policy is that they have become the leading center of the world colonial system. Here, only a few facts and historical events need to be cited: When the great Chinese people stood up and struggled for national liberation, resisting long-term colonial oppression, the American colonialists tried to strangle the legitimate aspirations of the Chinese people, supplying the corrupt Chiang Kai-shek clique with weapons worth 6 billion U.S. dollars, vainly attempting to block the surging liberation movement of the Chinese people. Similarly, under the guise of the United Nations, they launched a war of aggression against the glorious Korean people. They bore 75 percent of the military expenses in Indochina to promote the French colonialists' war of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In addition, they turned Japan into a huge base of aggression, prompting the revival of Japanese militarism, the age-old enemy of Asian people's independence.

    The American colonialists came to Geneva under the pressure of the will of the people of various countries. They fiercely opposed the peaceful reunification of Korea; opposed ending the Indochina war and attempted to internationalize the conflict by all means. There is no doubt that this aggressive policy is the greatest obstacle and main threat to the youth and people of colonial and dependent countries in striving for independence, progress, and a peaceful future today. At the same time, this policy is also a direct threat to the security and peace of the people of the world.

    We declare: a truly collective security and peace-keeping policy should be based on the principles of coexistence of different social systems, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, mutual understanding, and the settlement of all international disputes through political consultation.

      (II)

    It is quite obvious that the era in which colonialists could arbitrarily dispose of the fate of colonies and dependent countries is gone forever. In recent years, the People's Republic of China, with a population of 600 million, has stepped onto the world political stage. The Korean people and, recently, the Vietnamese people have achieved great victories in the struggle against the aggressors. India, Indonesia, and Burma have shown unwillingness to tolerate the United States' war policy. All this clearly points out that the national liberation struggle of colonial and dependent countries, as well as the movement to consolidate peace in Asia and the world, is flourishing.

    In Malaya, the Philippines, and all other Asian countries, millions of young people and students will contribute their youthful vitality and all the strength of their legitimate demands for freedom to the cause of the people of all countries striving for independence.

    The heroic struggle of the youth and students of Iran, Iraq, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, South Africa, the Gold Coast, Cameroon, Senegal, and all African and Middle Eastern countries for the national liberation cause of their people is known to all. They always stand at the forefront of mass demonstrations, being the first to expose all conspiracies and repel the attempts of the reactionary forces in these countries to sell out national interests and compromise and surrender in front of the aggressors.

    Similarly, the youth and students of Latin America, due to their courage, decisiveness, and strong combativeness, have also made strong contributions to the people's liberation struggle from Guatemala to Brazil, from Venezuela to Cuba, and throughout Central and South America. In recent years, the youth and student movement has greatly developed in this struggle for national liberation. All this shows that the youth of colonial dependent countries are fully aware that national independence is the primary condition for building a happy life.

    The youth of colonial dependent countries recognize that all attempts to disrupt peace, no matter what form they take, seriously threaten their survival. The youth resolutely oppose all military aggression treaties and arms races, oppose dragging their countries and the people of all countries into military blocs and conventions, and oppose the establishment of military bases on their territories. The youth resolutely demand the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and all weapons of mass destruction.

    In the struggle for sacred rights, for national independence and peace, the youth encounter enormous difficulties. However, neither large-scale terror nor retaliation can stop the youth's desire for a happy life. Although the struggle is arduous, the youth are full of optimism. They have every right to look forward to their future with confidence.

    Dear friends, the youth of all countries who love justice and peace, including the youth of the suzerain states (whose governments oppress the people of colonies and dependent countries, but the youth of the suzerain states fight for the liberation of the colonial people), are unprecedentedly united and stand with the youth of colonial and dependent countries, supporting their struggle.

    In the process of the war against the Korean people, the support of the youth of the world for the youth of the colonial countries, as well as the will to defend peace, was powerfully manifested. They resolutely demanded the cessation of this massacre. The youth, together with all progressive mankind, shouted loudly: "No invasion of Korea is allowed!". The war launched by the French colonialists against the Vietnamese people under the instigation and active support of American imperialism also aroused universal indignation and resolute protests, as well as demands for an immediate ceasefire. The youth of the world have contributed to striving for the cessation of this dirty war.

    The ugly adventure launched against Guatemala aroused great anger in all countries of the world and all Latin American countries, and various mass rallies and demonstrations were held everywhere to express sympathy for the people and youth of Guatemala. The youth resolutely protested against these shameful acts that violated the legitimate desire of the people to decide their own destiny.

    When we talk about the international solidarity of the youth of all countries in the world with the youth of colonial and dependent countries, it should be emphasized that, in the current situation, the most prominent feature is the universality of this solidarity.

    The youth of all countries in the world, especially the youth of the suzerain states, have realized their responsibility in helping their brothers and sisters to liberate themselves from the oppression and enslavement of colonialism. The youth of the world know that colonialism is a constant threat to the desire for freedom and peace. They are increasingly strengthening their struggle, strengthening friendly ties with the youth of colonial countries, to oppose colonialism. No force can destroy this selfless solidarity.

    Such a powerful solidarity movement is unprecedented. In the future, fraternal solidarity with the youth of colonial countries will become a part of the life and activities of the democratic youth movements of all countries.

    The World Federation of Democratic Youth conducts its activities according to the following principles, namely, the love, equality, and friendship between the youth of all countries and continents, all races, all religious beliefs, and political tendencies.

    Faithful to these principles, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has always held high the banner of fighting for the freedom, national independence, and a better future of the youth of oppressed countries. It expresses deep solidarity with the youth of these countries in various forms. Whether in Asia or in the Middle East, the Near East, in Africa or in Latin America, wherever the rights of the people and youth are violated, wherever incidents of suppression and violence occur, the World Federation of Youth has never failed to protest, never failing to do its utmost to expose these incidents before public opinion or to call on the youth of the world to express their indignation at the colonialists and their support and solidarity with the youth of colonial and dependent countries.

    (III)

    The youth of colonial and dependent countries are living in terrible situations of enslavement and racial discrimination, living in situations of loss of national independence, and they are facing the threat of new wars. This difficult situation gives the member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth a major responsibility. The member organizations of the World Federation of Youth should always pay attention to strengthening the struggle activities of the youth of colonial and dependent countries for freedom and national independence. The youth should rise up more resolutely to oppose interference in the internal affairs of these countries in any way. They should more actively demand genuine independence, oppose economic expansion, and strive for the development of their own national economy, the implementation of land reform, and the promotion of national culture. As we see it, the member organizations of the World Federation of Youth should link the struggle for freedom and national independence with the struggle for the right to life, the realization of the most pressing demands (including the guarantee of work, the minimum living needs, and land for young farmers).

    The youth of colonial and dependent countries should rise up with the greatest enthusiasm to oppose all acts of military aggression, oppose all foreign interference in the internal affairs of these countries, oppose dragging these countries into military blocs, oppose the establishment of military bases on the territories of these countries, and oppose the arms race.

    In order to realize all these fair and reasonable demands, the member organizations of the World Federation of Youth should carry out explanatory, educational, and organizational work among the broadest masses of youth in urban and rural areas. The task of the member organizations of the World Federation of Youth in their own countries is to make every young man and woman aware of the importance and necessity of striving to meet their legitimate demands. The member organizations should pay special attention to inviting new masses of youth to participate in the activities of their organizations, intensify their work, expand their influence, and thus consolidate their organizations.

    We know that only in unity can the youth's struggle be victorious. We advocate the need to constantly consolidate this unity on the basis of the freedom, independence, and common vested interests of all youth in order to strive for a better life.

    Therefore, the World Federation of Youth unswervingly calls on the youth and their organizations in colonial and dependent countries: for the aspirations of the youth of these countries, they should consolidate and expand unity, and develop brotherly ties and mutual friendship.

    All youth organizations, including the youth of the suzerain countries, should expand their solidarity with the youth of colonial dependent countries. In the struggle against colonialism, against all repression, violence, and aggression, they should arouse the indignation of increasingly broad masses and unite them to strive to liberate their brothers from the shackles of colonialism.

    In order to provide increasingly effective assistance to the youth organizations of colonial and dependent countries, the World Federation of Youth must constantly and unremittingly study the situation in these countries in depth, so that it can provide more specific and effective assistance to each youth organization in light of the characteristics of the youth movement in each country.

### 殖民地和附属国青年为争取和平、民族独立和青年的美好将来而斗争——一九五四年八月九日在世界民主青年联盟理事会北京会议上的报告摘要

    殖民地和附属国青年为争取和平、民族独立和青年的美好将来而斗争
    ——一九五四年八月九日在世界民主青年联盟理事会北京会议上的报告摘要
    世界民主青年联盟主席  布伦诺·柏尼尼亲爱的朋友们：
    今天千百万青年还生活在被殖民主义者奴役的非人道的境地。地球上几乎半数的人口（占百分之四十四）生活在殖民地和附属国中。在反法西斯战争胜利之后，殖民地人民争取从压迫下解放自己的国家、争取自己的国家在和平劳动中繁荣兴盛的斗争，一年比一年、一月比一月、一天比一天地更加壮大而无敌了。人类历史上从来没有过这样大规模的运动。有些整个国家的人民从殖民制度的枷锁下解放出来，获得了完全的独立。另外一些国家的人民已经坚决地走上这条民族解放的道路。殖民制度的基础已经动摇了。中华人民共和国的成立震撼了整个殖民世界，朝鲜和越南人民反对侵略者的巨大胜利也具有重要的历史意义。
    殖民地和附属国人民的迅速觉醒，以及他们为争取独立和平等神圣权利所进行的英勇斗争，对于争取全世界和平与进步这一全人类共同事业的贡献，愈来愈大而难以估量。青年就在这个强大运动的最前列斗争着。
      （一）
    所有参加本届理事会会议的人，都非常了解殖民主义给世界上很大一部分人民和青年带来了非人道的贫困。参加会议的人有一些还亲自有这种痛苦的经验。
    每个人都知道，这些国家拥有巨大的天然资源和世界上最富饶的辽阔的土地。
    所有这些财富都被殖民主义者据为己有。这些国家的青年和人民不能利用这些财富，相反地，殖民主义者还不断加强对这些国家的人民和青年的剥削，使他们的贫困日益加深。失业、贫困和饥饿一年比一年、一月比一月地增加着。这种非人道的生活条件是全体人类所不能忍受的。
    千百万殖民地与附属国的居民被剥夺了人类最基本的权利，被剥夺了劳动权，同时，实际上被剥夺了生活的权利。
    不断增长的失业、低微的工资、不能忍受的饥饿及贫穷、缺乏卫生住所、几乎完全缺乏医药治疗、卫生设备不够，这一切，促使青年及人民寿命短促。特别在南非，本地人的死亡率从一九三八年到现在几乎增加了一倍，比欧洲的死亡率高出二十倍。根据联合国的统计，印度人的平均寿命是二十六岁，巴西有些地区的人是二十八岁。这表现出儿童和青年的死亡率是如何的可怕。
    殖民主义制度用一切方法来毁灭民族文化。在所有殖民地和附属国中，几乎普遍存在的文盲，已经成为一种制度。用本国语文学习的权利被漠视并且往往被禁止。在阿尔及利亚，百分之八十五的人口是阿拉伯人，在法国殖民主义统治下，阿拉伯文被当作外国语文，而法文却被强迫当作法定语文。可是，即使用法文学习，法国殖民主义者也认为是危险的，因为这样会使青年懂得殖民主义者所不愿意他们懂得的东西。
    殖民地人民和青年的最基本的政治权利几乎在各地都被剥夺或受限制。几乎在所有的国家中，青年们从童年起就遭受着种族歧视，这种歧视追随着他们整个的一生，成为一种最大的不幸。
    此外还要说到这些人民所遭受的残杀和暴行：他们受到警察镇压和迫害，这是违反一切的甚至最基本的个人自由权利的。这些侵犯个人最基本的自由权利的野蛮方式，在很多国家里还是可以找到。以南非为例，那里的黑人被夺去了土地，被迫在
  “指定地区”或“特别地区”生活，他们不能自由外出或旅行；非经特许，不能在晚上十时以后在外逗留，否则就会被捕，或被罚在殖民者的庄园里作苦工。
    在殖民地和附属国家里，存在着殖民主义统治的公开专政；人民自由成立自己的组织、决定自己命运的一切权利都被蹂躏了。近来殖民者因为看到人民争取完全自由和独立的不断高涨的决心，已经认识到用老一套办法来维持他们的统治是不可能的了。他们现在便采用更圆滑的殖民主义奴役的新方法。
    在南非，说是已经给予了某种独立，但是根据宪法，只有白种人有被选举权，而白种人只占全人口的五分之一。当地土著人民只有百分之四有选举权。
    菲律宾从一九四六年就得到了“独立宪章”，但美国在那里保留了二十三个最重要的海陆军基地。一九五○年，通过分裂和战争的政策，美国又在菲律宾取得了新的领土，于是一共拥有三十五个军事基地，实际上在菲律宾领土上依然保持了公开的军事占领制度。
    当殖民地、半殖民地和附属国的人民不同意现存制度，并力争民族独立的基本权利的时候，殖民主义者的狰狞面目就清楚地暴露出来了。于是开始了迫害、恐怖、集体监禁和屠杀。
    不久以前，我们和全人类一样曾目睹了危地马拉这个小国家的人民所遭受的侵略。危地马拉人民仅仅想要限制一下那像章鱼一样，把臂膀伸到整个中美洲经济部门的强大美国垄断资本“联合果品公司”的控制，就遭到了攻击，他们国家的整个国民生活被破坏了。危地马拉人民所自由选择的政府被暴力推翻了。恐怖笼罩着全国，农民的土地又被夺走了，选举法改变了。全国人口的百分之七十五被剥夺了选举权；工会和青年组织被解散了，成百成千的青年和自由公民被监禁、被杀害。
    不难了解为什么殖民主义者采取最野蛮的方法来企图镇压一切争取民族独立的行动。这是因为他们想要对殖民地和附属国人民实行无限制和无拘束的掠夺和剥削。对这些人民的经济奴役，给当地人带来可怕的灾难，却使殖民主义者装满了他们的私囊。他们抢夺殖民地与附属国人民的一切：土地、矿藏和原料。
    举例说，在中美洲，美国独占资本“联合果品公司”控制最肥沃的土地二百五十万公顷；在马来亚，生产橡胶的土地四分之三是英国公司的财产；在阿尔及利亚，法国殖民公司占有百分之五十五的可耕土地。
    地下富源是发展一切现代经济最重要的基础之一，而这些富源掌握在外国公司的手中：例如缅甸的锌、沙特阿拉伯和伊朗的石油、黄金海岸和比属刚果的金、罗得西亚的铜。在拉丁美洲，殖民主义者控制了百分之八十的石油生产；北美独占资本“美国钢铁公司”和“伯利恒钢铁公司”独占了所有的铁矿开采地，美国独占资本完全控制了铜的开采。
    农业还是当地大多数人口的主要职业，而殖民主义者在农业方面的控制，就意味着保存封建的生产方式，建立大规模的深耕单一作物的种植园，强使农业生产只朝单一的方向发展；就意味着不顾当地人民最基本的利益和需要，开发各种原料。
    近年来，殖民主义体系中发生了很大的变化。若干殖民主义者继承了另一些殖民主义者。英、法、荷、比殖民主义者的势力一年比一年缩小了，但同时美国垄断资本在殖民地国家里的势力则日益扩大。以中东的情况为例，在中东的石油生产中，美国在一九四六年只占百分之十七，到一九五二年就达到了百分之五十九，而英国在同时期内从百分之七十六降到百分之三十三。
    新的殖民主义者的得势，造成了更大规模的掠夺和更残酷的剥削。美国殖民主义者的政策的最大特点，就是他们已经成为世界殖民主义体系的领导中心。这里只需要举出几个事实和历史事件：当伟大的中国人民站起来，为争取民族解放、反抗长期的殖民压迫而斗争时，美国殖民主义者力图扼杀中国人民合法的愿望，以价值六十亿美元的武器供给蒋介石腐化集团，妄想阻挡中国人民汹涌的解放运动。同样，他们在联合国名义的掩饰下，发动了对光荣的朝鲜人民的侵略战争。他们在印度支那负担了百分之七十五的军事费用，来推动法国殖民主义者对越南民主共和国的侵略战争。此外，他们把日本变为巨大的侵略基地，促使亚洲人民独立的世仇——日本军国主义复活。
    美国殖民主义者在各国人民意志的压力下来到日内瓦。他们激烈地反对朝鲜的和平统一；反对结束印度支那战争并企图以一切方法使冲突国际化。毫无疑问，这个侵略政策是今天殖民地和附属国青年和人民争取独立、进步、和平前途的最大障碍和主要威胁。同时，这个政策也是对全世界人民安全与和平的直接威胁。
    我们宣称：一个真正集体安全与保卫和平的政策，应当建立在各个不同社会制度可以共处、不干涉他国内政、相互了解，以及通过政治协商解决一切国际纠纷等原则之上。
      （二）
    十分明显，殖民主义者可以任意摆布殖民地和附属国家命运的时代已经一去不复返了。最近几年来，拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国已经走上了世界政治舞台。朝鲜人民以及最近越南人民在反对侵略者的斗争中，已经获得了巨大的胜利。印度、印尼、缅甸表现了不愿意忍受美国的战争政策。这一切都明显地指出：殖民地和附属国的民族解放斗争以及巩固亚洲与全世界和平的运动，正在蓬勃发展中。
    在马来亚、菲律宾以及所有亚洲其他国家，千百万青年和学生，都将在各国人民争取独立的事业中，贡献出他们的青年活力与对自由的正当要求的全部力量。
    伊朗、伊拉克、摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、南非、黄金海岸、喀麦隆、塞内加尔以及所有非洲和中东国家的青年和学生，对本国人民的民族解放事业所作的英勇斗争，是大家都知道的。他们始终站在群众示威运动的最前列，最先揭露一切阴谋，击退这些国家的反动势力在侵略者的面前出卖民族利益与妥协投降的企图。
    同样地，拉丁美洲的青年和学生，由于他们的勇敢、坚决和坚强的战斗性，也对从危地马拉到巴西，从委内瑞拉到古巴以及中美、南美各地的人民解放斗争，作了有力的贡献。近几年来，在这个争取民族解放的斗争中，青年与学生运动得到了很大的发展。这一切说明殖民地附属国青年已充分觉悟到：民族独立是建设幸福生活的首要条件。
    殖民地附属国家的青年认识到：一切破坏和平的企图，不论采取什么形式，都严重地威胁着他们的生存。青年们坚决反对一切军事侵略条约和军备竞赛，反对把他们的国家以及各国人民拖入军事集团和公约，反对在他们的领土上建立军事基地。青年们坚决要求禁止使用原子武器、氢武器、以及一切大规模毁灭性的武器。
    在争取神圣权利、争取民族独立与和平的斗争中，青年们遭遇到巨大的困难。然而，不论是大规模的恐怖或报复，都不能阻挡青年追求幸福生活的愿望。虽然斗争是艰苦的，但青年们充满了乐观精神。他们完全有权利满怀信心地展望自己的未来。
    亲爱的朋友们，世界各国爱好正义与和平的青年，包括宗主国的青年在内（宗主国的政府压迫殖民地与附属国的人民，但是宗主国的青年则为殖民地人民的解放而斗争），空前地团结一致，和殖民地与附属国的青年站在一起，支持他们的斗争。
    在进攻朝鲜人民的战争过程中，全世界青年对殖民地国家青年的支援，以及保卫和平的意志有力地表现出来了。他们坚决要求停止这一场屠杀。青年们和全体进步人类一起大声疾呼：“不准侵犯朝鲜！”。法国殖民主义者在美帝国主义者的唆使以及积极支持下对越南人民所发动的战争，同样引起了普遍愤慨和坚决抗议，以及立刻停战的要求。全世界青年为了争取停止这个肮脏战争，作出了贡献。
    对危地马拉发动的丑恶的冒险行动，在世界各国与所有拉丁美洲国家掀起了巨大愤怒，为了表示对危地马拉人民和青年的同情，各地都举行了各种各样的群众大会和示威游行。青年们坚决提出抗议，反对这些违反人民决定自己命运的合法愿望的可耻行为。
    当我们谈到全世界各国青年与殖民地和附属国青年的国际团结的时候，应该强调指出，在目前情况下，最突出的特点，就是这种团结的普遍性。
    全世界各国青年，特别是宗主国的青年，已意识到他们在帮助他们的兄弟姊妹们从殖民主义的压迫和奴役下解放出来这一方面所负的责任。全世界青年都知道，殖民主义是对要求自由与和平的愿望的一个经常威胁。他们越来越加强他们的斗争、加强和殖民地国家青年的友好联系，以反对殖民主义。任何力量也不能破坏这种大公无私的团结。
    像这样强有力的团结运动，是前所未见的。今后，对殖民地国家青年的兄弟般的团结，将成为一切国家民主青年运动的生活与活动的一部分。
    世界民主青年联盟根据下列原则进行活动，即一切国家与大陆、一切种族、一切宗教信仰和政治倾向的青年间的友爱、平等和友谊。
    忠实于这些原则的世界民主青年联盟，始终高举着争取被压迫国家青年的自由、民族独立与美好前途的战斗的旗帜。它用各种不同的形式来表示对这些国家的青年的深厚的团结。无论是在亚洲或是在中东、近东，在非洲或是在拉丁美洲，凡是人民和青年的权利受到侵犯、凡是发生镇压和施用暴力的事件，世界青联没有一次不提出抗议，没有一次不以最大的努力在公众舆论前进行揭发或号召全世界青年表示他们对殖民主义者的愤慨以及对殖民地和附属国家青年的支援和团结。

    殖民地和附属国青年正生活在奴役与种族歧视的可怕的情况中，生活在丧失民族独立的情况中，他们面临着新的战争的威胁，这种艰苦的情况，给了世界青联的会员组织一个重大的责任。世界青联各会员组织应当经常注意加强殖民地和附属国青年争取自由与民族独立的斗争活动。青年们应当更加坚决地起来反对以任何方式干涉这些国家的内政。他们应当更加积极地要求真正的独立，反对经济扩张，为争取发展本国的国民经济，实行土地改革和发扬民族文化而斗争。照我们的意思，世界青联各会员组织应当把为自由与民族独立的斗争，与争取生活权利、实现最迫切的要求（包括工作的保障、最低限度的生活需要，给青年农民以土地）的斗争联系起来。
    殖民地与附属国青年应该以最大的热情起来反对一切军事侵略行为，反对一切外国干涉这些国家的内政，反对把这些国家拖入军事集团，反对在这些国家的领土上设立军事基地以及反对军备竞赛。
    为了实现这一切公平合理的要求，世界青联的会员组织应当在最广大的城乡青年群众中，展开解释、教育和组织的工作。世界青联的会员组织在他们国内的任务是使每一个男女青年都认识到争取满足他们的合理要求的重要性和必要性。各会员组织应特别注意邀请新的青年群众参加他们的组织的活动，加紧工作，扩大自己的影响，这样来巩固自己的组织。
    我们知道，只有在团结中，青年的斗争才能获得胜利。我们主张有必要在全体青年的自由、独立与共同切身利益的基础上，为争取更美好的生活，不断地巩固这种团结。
    因此世界青联坚持不渝地向殖民地和附属国的青年及其组织发出号召：为了这些国家的青年的愿望，应当巩固并扩大团结，发展兄弟般的联系和相互间的友谊。
    一切青年组织，包括宗主国家的青年，都应当扩大他们和殖民地附属国青年的团结。在反对殖民主义、反对一切镇压、暴力、侵略的斗争中，他们应当激起日益广大的群众的愤慨，并且使他们团结起来，争取将他们的兄弟们从殖民主义的桎梏下解放出来。
    为了给予殖民地和附属国的青年组织以日益有效的援助，世界青联必须经常不懈地深入研究这些国家的情况，这样，才能针对每个国家青年运动的特点，对各个青年组织予以更具体而有效的援助。
