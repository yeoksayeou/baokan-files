    Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: Vietnam News Agency reported on the 9th that Bảo Đại puppet troops stationed in North Vietnam, unwilling to withdraw to the South and continue serving as cannon fodder, are deserting and returning home in droves. On July 16th, after the puppet troops stationed in Quảng Yên Province, northwest of Haiphong, received orders to prepare for withdrawal to South Vietnam, more than 1,000 men deserted with their weapons, including many lieutenants and second lieutenants. United States media admitted that Vietnamese drivers in the puppet army have been prohibited from driving military vehicles because many of them have been driving the vehicles to the liberated areas. The entire staff of the psychological warfare unit of the Bảo Đại puppet regime in North Vietnam has defected to the people's side.
    The anti-armistice activities organized by the Bảo Đại-Ngô Đình Diệm clique in North Vietnam have also been opposed by the people. On July 19th, the Bảo Đại traitors ordered residents of Haiphong to strike and demonstrate. However, the city's residents ignored these puppets' activities. Stores remained open as usual, market transactions continued as normal, and the streets were as crowded as usual. As a result, only about fifty people, who had just been rounded up by the puppets from the Bùi Chu and Phát Diệm areas, walked listlessly through the streets with small flags. As they walked, they explained to passers-by: "We all support the armistice, we are being forced to participate in this demonstration."

    保大伪军不愿南撤纷纷逃跑
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社九日报道：驻在北越的保大伪军不愿南撤继续充当炮灰，纷纷开小差回家。七月十六日，在海防西北的广安省境内驻扎的伪军，在接到准备撤往南越的命令后就有一千多人丢枪逃跑，其中有许多中尉和少尉级的军官。美国合众社承认，伪军中的越南籍司机已被禁止驾驶军用车辆，因为他们中间已有很多人将车子驶往解放区去。保大傀儡在北越的心理作战处的全体人员已投向人民方面来。
    保大—吴庭艳集团在北越组织的反停战活动也遭到人民的反对。七月十九日，保大卖国贼们曾命令海防的居民罢市和举行示威。但是全市居民对这些傀儡们的勾当不理不睬，商店照常营业，市场交易照常进行，街道上也和平常一样地挤满了人。结果，当天只有约五十个刚被傀儡们从裴朱和发艳地区抓来的人拿着小旗在街上无精打采地走着。这些人边走边向路人解释：我们全都赞成停战，我们是被迫来参加这场示威的。
