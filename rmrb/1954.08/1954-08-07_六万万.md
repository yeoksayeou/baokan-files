China has always been known as "vast in territory and rich in resources, with a large population," but the exact amount of resources and population has always been a mystery. The rulers of old China did not care about these two issues. Although imperialists conducted many surveys and estimations for the purpose of aggression, they were not very reliable. In particular, the population figure has always been subject to various claims. In 1910, the Manchu government, in preparation for the so-called "constitutional monarchy," conducted a national census, but it was not completed before the Xinhai Revolution broke out, sending the government and its "constitutional monarchy" farce to its end. Later, the American Wilcox estimated the Chinese population at 342 million at that time, based on this incomplete survey. In 1922, the "Continuation Committee of the Christian Church in China" estimated the figure to be between 350 million and 400 million. In 1929, the pseudo-postal administration's survey figure was over 480 million. There were many other estimates by Chinese and foreigners. The more popular figures were first 400 million, then 450 million, and later 475 million. In recent years, there have been more reliable estimates, mostly saying over 500 million. These disparate figures, on the one hand, illustrate the growth of China's population, and on the other hand, demonstrate their lack of "authority."

In the few years since liberation, the People's Government has begun to conduct a major cleanup, and as a result, it has found far more treasures underground than we expected, and the population figure has also far exceeded previous estimates. According to the recent report by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the population of China as of 24:00 on June 30, 1953, was 601,912,371.

That's great! The population of China is no longer a mystery. 601,912,371 is an authoritative figure, the accurate population figure from the first comprehensive census in our history. For years, we have been talking about "450 million" and "500 million" and were proud of this huge number, but we did not expect to have unintentionally reduced the national population by more than one-sixth.

Leaving out the odd numbers, let's just say 600 million. This is good news, not only for ourselves, but also for the people in the camp of peace and democracy.

But for the imperialists and their employed "scholars," this is not good news.

Malthusian population theorists have long been clamoring that the world population is too large. British biologist Julian Huxley once said at the London Food Conference that the world population is increasing at a rate of two people every three seconds, so reducing the population is an urgent problem. American Cornell University's Pearson and Harper co-authored a book "The World's Hunger," which tells us that the maximum suitable population that the earth can sustain is 900 million. Some people even think this number is too large, reducing it to 750 million, or even… 500 million!

According to these people's logic, the world is not big enough to accommodate a Chinese population plus an Indian population, or even just a Chinese population. Therefore, Pearson and Harper absurdly believe that only war and famine, etc., can solve the problem of overpopulation. When discussing the "plan" to reduce the world population, they could not help but say with emotion:

"War, plague, and famine are the methods to achieve this plan, but everyone is making every effort to prevent or weaken them."

We do not know the specific plans of these two man-haters who intend to eliminate hundreds of millions of people from the earth, for example, who does not have the right to live and should be eliminated. But one thing seems certain, that the world's overpopulation should first be blamed on China, because the Chinese account for a quarter of it.

Malthus himself studied the Chinese population. Back then, he thought the Chinese population was too large. According to his high opinion, China should only have 280 million people, but he estimated that the Chinese population during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty was already no less than 323 million. Former US Secretary of State in the Truman administration, Acheson, said in the 1949 White Paper on "Sino-US Relations": "The population of China has doubled in the 18th and 19th centuries, thus becoming an unbearable pressure on China." The implication is that without the "relief" of American flour, China will always be in chaos, and the Communist Party will have no solution.

However, the facts are just making a joke with this group of population theorists and imperialists. The Chinese population is now more than 600 million.

Now, in China, we no longer hear people talking about the "population problem," but only about the "talent problem." There is no doubt that countless talents will emerge from our 600 million people in the future.

Ilyin once calculated in his article "Earth and Man" that even without any amazing scientific inventions, if the world's population increases threefold today, people still have the power to eliminate famine from the earth. The wealth on earth is inexhaustible, as long as there is a reasonable social system that allows people to make good use of it.

"China's large population is a great thing. It is entirely possible to increase the population many times over, and the method is production." "Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle can be created. We are the rebuttal of Acheson's counter-revolutionary theory. We believe that revolution can change everything. A new China with a large population, abundant resources, a prosperous life, and a flourishing culture will arrive soon. All pessimistic arguments are completely unfounded." These are the words from the Xinhua News Agency's "Six Comments on the White Paper" in 1949. The history of the past five years has proven and continues to prove these words.

Six hundred million, this is a powerful force.

In the past, Lu Xun ridiculed some unprogressive people who often comforted themselves with "China is vast in territory and rich in resources, with a large population." He was completely correct. But now it is different. Our 600 million people have awakened from their slumber, broken free from their shackles, and stand tall in Asia. The people of Asia are looking at us, and the people of the world are looking at us. We have every reason to be proud of our 600 million hardworking and brave people.

Six hundred million plus the population of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries exceeds 900 million. Holding hands, we surround the earth, forming a strong front for peace, enough to make all imperialist warmongers tremble with fear. And now, our 600 million are uniting with all peace-loving and democratic people in Asia and the world.

No wonder the British Times said when talking about our newly announced population figures: "This announcement cannot but deeply touch anyone who considers its important significance."

But there is still such a small group of deaf and blind people in the world. Six hundred million people stand in front of them, but they cannot see. The voices of six hundred million people ring in their ears, but they cannot hear. They say they "do not recognize" the great country of the People's Republic of China. They only see Chiang Kai-shek.

Perhaps this is what the ancient Chinese saying means, "A leaf blinds the eye, and Mount Tai cannot be seen."

But "not seeing" is not possible, because Mount Tai is an objective reality, and those who deny objective reality are bound to run into a wall. Truman did not believe this sentence, and rushed from Korea to the Chinese border with his eyes closed. Sure enough, he banged his head against Mount Tai, breaking his skin and bleeding, greatly losing face.

Dulles probably knows the lesson Truman learned. However, he is not resigned to defeat. He was forced to attend the Geneva Conference and sit in the same room with Premier Zhou, but he still tried every means to erase China's status as a major power. According to US news agencies, Dulles even turned his head away, not looking at Premier Zhou.

A few days ago, reactionary American politicians like Nolan were ranting and raving, saying that they would fight to the death to oppose "Communist China's entry into (?) the United Nations," and Eisenhower and Dulles also made speeches one after another, continuing to erase China's legitimate status in the United Nations. It seems that these people's heads are still turned away.

"Turning your head away" may have two explanations: one is that you don't want to look, and the other is that you dare not look. Probably these people have both of these two kinds of psychology. But whether you don't want to or dare not, not looking is not possible. Who has ever seen someone walking with their head turned away?

Imperialists should be careful of the "wall" built by these 600 million people!

    六万万
    若水
    中国一向号称“地大物博，人口众多”，可是究竟有多少资源，多少人口，却一直是笔糊涂账。这两个问题，旧中国的统治者是不关心的；帝国主义虽然为了侵略的目的而作了不少调查和估计，也不很靠得住。特别是人口数字，历来就有许多种说法。一九一○年，满清政府为了筹备所谓“君主立宪”，曾经作过一次全国户口调查，但没有完成，就爆发了辛亥革命，把这个政府连同它的“君主立宪”把戏一同送了终。后来美国人威尔柯克斯根据这个不完全的调查，估计当时中国的人口是三万万四千二百万。一九二二年“基督教中国继续委员会”的估计数字是三万万五千万到四万万之间。一九二九年伪邮政局的调查数字是四万万八千多万。其他中国人和外国人的估计还很多。比较流行的说法，先是四万万，后来是四万万五千万，再后是四万万七千五百万；近年来有了比较可靠的估计，多说是五万万以上。这些悬殊的数字，一方面固然说明了中国人口的增长，另一方面也表现了它们的不够“权威”。
    解放以来这几年，人民政府才开始作了一番大清理，结果发现地下的宝贝比我们料想的多得多，而人口数字也远远超出向来的估计。据最近邓小平同志的报告，中国的人口在一九五三年六月三十日二十四时的数字是——六万万零一百九十一万二千三百七十一。
    这一下好了，中国的人口再也不是一笔糊涂账了。六万万零一百九十一万二千三百七十一，这是一个权威数字，是我国有史以来第一次全面普查的准确的人口数字。这些年我们老在口上挂着“四万万五千万”“五万万”，为这个巨大的数字而骄傲，却不料在无意中把全国人口减少了六分之一以上。
    除去零头不算，就算六万万吧。这是一个好消息，不但我们自己高兴，和平民主阵营的人民也会感到鼓舞。
    但对于帝国主义者和他们的御用“学者”，这可不是好消息。
    马尔萨斯人口论者长久以来就在嚷着世界人口太多。英国生物学家朱利安·赫胥黎曾在伦敦食粮会议上说过，世界人口以每三秒钟两个人的速率增加着，因此减少人口是个迫不容缓的问题。美国康乃尔大学的皮尔生和哈柏两人合写了一本“世界的饥馑”，这本书告诉我们说，地球能够维持的适当人口最多是九万万。有的人还嫌这个数字太大，减低到七万万五千万，甚至……五万万！
    按照这些人的逻辑，世界之大，还不能够容下一个中国的人口加上一个印度的人口，或者甚至容不下单单一个中国的人口。因此，皮尔生和哈柏就荒谬地认为只有战争和饥饿等等才能解决人口太多的问题，他们在讨论减缩世界人口的“计划”时，不禁慨然说：
    “战争、鼠疫和饥荒是实现这个计划的方法，但是每一个人却作种种努力去阻止或削弱它们。”
    这两位打算把十几万万人口从地球上清除掉的憎恶人类者，他们的具体计划如何，比如说，究竟什么人没有生存的权利，应归于淘汰之列，我们不得而知。但有一点似乎是可以肯定的，那就是世界人口太多，首先应该归咎于中国，因为中国人占了四分之一。
    马尔萨斯本人也研究过中国人口，早在那时，他就认为中国人口太多。据他的高见，中国只应该有两万万八百万人，而他估计清朝康熙时中国人口已经不下三万万两千三百万了。美国前任杜鲁门政府国务卿艾奇逊在一九四九年的“中美关系”白皮书里说：“中国的人口，在十八、十九世纪中增加了一倍，因此对于中国成为一种不堪重负的压力。”言外之意就是：非靠美国的面粉“救济”不可，不然中国永远是天下大乱，共产党也没有办法。
    可是，事实却偏偏和这班人口论者以及帝国主义者开玩笑，中国人口现在已是六万万之多了。
    现在中国听不见人们谈论什么“人口问题”，只听见“人材问题”。我们六万万人口中将来会产生无数人材，那是没有问题的。
    伊林在“地球和人”一文中曾经计算过，在今天，即使没有任何惊人的科学发明，世界人口增加到三倍，人们还是有力量使饥馑从地球上清除出去。地球上的财富是取之不尽用之不竭的，只要有合理的社会制度使人们能够好好利用它。
    “中国人口广大是一件极大的好事。再增加多少倍人口也完全有办法，这办法就是生产。”“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。我们是艾奇逊反革命理论的驳斥者，我们相信革命能改变一切，一个人口众多、物产丰盛、生活优裕、文化昌盛的新中国，不要很久就可以到来，一切悲观论调是完全没有根据的。”这是一九四九年新华社“六评白皮书”中的话，五年来的历史已经证明了并正在继续证明着这些话。
    六万万，这是一个强大的力量。
    过去鲁迅曾经嘲笑过某些不长进的人动不动就以“中国地大物博，人口众多”自慰，他是完全正确的。但现在不同了，我们的六万万人口已经从沉睡中觉醒，挣脱了身上的锁链，屹然挺立在亚洲。亚洲的人民望着我们，全世界的人民望着我们。我们完全有理由为我们六万万勤劳而勇敢的人民而傲骄。
    六万万加上苏联和人民民主国家的人口，就超过了九万万。我们手挽着手，环绕着地球，构成了一道坚强的和平阵线，足以使一切帝国主义好战分子胆战心惊。而现在，我们的六万万又正在和亚洲和全世界一切爱好和平民主的人民联合。
    难怪英国泰晤士报在谈到我们新近宣布的人口数字时说：“这种宣布不能不深深打动任何考虑它的重要意义的人。”
    但是世界上还有这么一小撮又聋又瞎的人，六万万人站在他们面前，他们看不见，六万万人的声音响在他们耳边，他们听不见。他们说，他们“不承认”中华人民共和国这样一个伟大的国家。他们只看见蒋介石。
    大概这就是中国古话说的，“一叶障目，不见泰山”吧。
    不过“不见”是不行的，因为泰山是客观存在，否认客观存在的人一定要碰壁。杜鲁门就是因为不相信这句话，闭着眼睛从朝鲜往中国边界闯，果然噹地一下，一头撞在泰山上，皮破血流，大大丢了脸。
    杜鲁门受的教训，杜勒斯大概不会不知道。然而他并不死心，被逼来参加日内瓦会议，和周总理坐在一间屋子里了，还要想尽办法抹煞中国的大国地位。据美国通讯社宣传说，杜勒斯甚至把头偏过去，不向周总理看一眼。
    不久前的日子，美国反动政客诺兰之流又在唾沫飞溅地直嚷，说什么拼死反对“共产党中国进入（？）联合国”，而艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯也先后发表谈话，继续抹煞中国在联合国的合法地位。看起来，这些人的头还在偏着。
    “偏过头去”可能有两种解释，一是不愿看，
  一是不敢看。大概这些人这两种心理兼而有之。但不论是不愿也好，不敢也好，不看是不行的。有谁见过偏着头走路的人么？
    帝国主义者要小心这六万万人筑成的“壁”！
