    Training Stage Art Personnel
    The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, in order to systematically improve the professional level of stage art personnel in state-owned drama troupes across the country, has entrusted the China Youth Art Theatre to hold stage art training classes starting in the second half of this year, systematically recruiting stage art personnel from provincial and municipal state-owned drama troupes for study. The first phase of the class has now started, divided into four groups: lighting, set design, props, and makeup. The learning method mainly involves internships, specifically learning and summarizing work experience through the stage art creation of one or two plays during actual work processes. The theatre also plans to organize corresponding reports, seminars, and viewings to assist learning and solve some technical problems. Participants in this training include personnel from twenty units such as the Central Institute for Nationalities Ethnic Art Troupe, the Inner Mongolia Drama Troupe, and the Hebei Provincial Drama Troupe. They are currently participating in work and study in groups such as "The Proposal" and "Uncle Vanya." This type of training class will continue to be held in the future so that various state-owned drama troupes can universally obtain learning opportunities. (Yin Shulong)
    Capital Art Troupes Visit Construction Workers
    According to the spirit of the "Instructions on Strengthening Cultural and Artistic Work in Factories, Mines, Construction Sites, and Enterprises" issued by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and to use culture and art to encourage the labor production enthusiasm of workers and enrich their cultural life, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Administration Office has invited the Central Experimental Opera House, the China Ping Opera Troupe, the China Acrobatic Troupe, the Beijing People's Art Theatre, the Beijing Film Actors Troupe, Beijing Peking Opera Troupes 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the New China Qin Opera Troupe, and ten other professional art troupes, a total of seventeen groups, to conduct autumn慰问 performance activities for the 200,000 construction workers in the capital. The time frame is from August to October. During these three months, each troupe will go to construction sites or perform outstanding drama, Peking opera, Ping opera, and Quyi programs for construction workers in open-air theatres; the Beijing People's Art Theatre plans to perform the newly rehearsed play "Bright Sky" on construction sites. All troupes participating in the慰问 performances believe that having the opportunity to serve construction workers is glorious, and many troupes have expressed their willingness to perform more shows, with some troupes voluntarily offering half of their performances as charity shows.

    East China Opera Research Institute Holds Yue Opera Actor Training Class
    Having already achieved certain results in holding a Kunqu Opera actor training class, the East China Opera Research Institute has decided to continue holding a Yue Opera actor training class.
    The purpose of holding the Yue Opera actor training class is to cultivate new Yue Opera actors.
    Yue Opera is one of the main opera forms in East China and has developed greatly since liberation. However, it is not without its shortcomings. For example, the issue of co-performance by men and women has not yet been resolved, which has become a major obstacle to Yue Opera's ability to portray real life. One of the tasks of the Yue Opera actor training class is to train male actors, so among the sixty students enrolled, forty are male and twenty are female.
    Southwest, East China Hold Art Exhibitions
    In order to enrich the cultural and artistic life of the people and encourage art workers to create, the Southwest Cultural Bureau and the Southwest District Art Workers Association jointly held the Southwest District Art Exhibition in Chongqing. A total of more than 1,500 works were exhibited. Artworks include New Year pictures, traditional Chinese paintings, prints, oil paintings, comic strips, watercolors, sketches, drawings, sculptures, and designs. The works in this exhibition reflect the spirit of the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers, and more broadly reflect the growth of socialist thought and new moral outlook in the people's lives. In addition to art creation, the exhibition also features architectural designs and models, reflecting the achievements of China's restoration and construction work since liberation. The exhibits also include folk arts and crafts of various ethnic groups in the Southwest, such as clothing, utensils, and embroidery.
    The East China Artists Association and the East China People's Fine Arts Publishing House jointly organized the "Fine Art Publications Exhibition" in Shanghai. The exhibition content includes part of the original manuscripts and printed materials of fine art works such as propaganda posters, New Year pictures, comic strips, comic strip posters, photography posters, photography albums, art albums, and picture cards published by the East China People's Publishing House in the past two years, totaling more than 200 kinds and 300 pieces. During the exhibition, symposium activities are planned to be organized to strengthen the connection between authors, publishers, and readers.
    Help Small Theatres Solve the Difficulty of Scripts
    The Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Opera Reform Committee often receives letters from local theatres raising the issue of script shortages and requesting assistance. The committee delegated this issue to the Cantonese opera playwrights mutual aid group, which it supervises, for discussion and research, and consulted with relevant theatres. The committee has now formulated "Provisional Measures for the Promotion of Cantonese Opera Scripts." The measures stipulate that all scripts written by members of the Cantonese opera playwrights mutual aid group in the future are willing to be promoted, and all theatres can apply to perform them in accordance with the prescribed procedures; and it is stipulated that the theatres performing the promoted scripts must take the performance seriously. At the same time, the first batch of 78 promoted scripts were designated, including 69 full-length plays such as "Yu Tang Chun" and "Zhuo Wenjun", and 9 short plays such as "Borrowing Boots" and "Interrogation in the Red Chamber". The measures have been implemented since August. (Li Yi)

    华东戏曲研究院举办越剧演员训练班
    华东戏曲研究院在举办了昆曲演员训练班，并已经取得了一定成绩的基础上，决定继续举办越剧演员训练班。
    举办越剧演员训练班的目的，是培养新的越剧演员。
    越剧是华东地区的主要剧种之一，解放以来，有很大的发展。但是，它也不是没有缺点的，例如男女合演的问题直到现在还未能解决，便成了越剧表现现实生活的一个很大的阻碍。越剧演员训练班的设立，任务之一就是培养男演员，因此在招收的六十名学员中，男生为四十名，女生为二十名。

    为了丰富人民群众的文化艺术生活，鼓励美术工作者进行创作，西南文化局和西南区美术工作者协会联合在重庆市举办西南区美术展览会。展出的作品共计有一千五百余件。美术作品包括有年画、国画、版画、油画、连环画、水彩、素描、速写、雕塑、图案等。这次展览的作品体现了中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会的精神，较为广泛地反映了人民生活中的社会主义思想的增长和新的道德面貌。展览会上除美术创作外，还有建筑设计和模型，这些作品反映了我国解放后恢复及建设工作中的成就。展览品中还有西南各民族民间工艺美术品，如服饰、用具、刺绣等。
    华东美术家协会、华东人民美术出版社联合在上海市主办“美术出版物展览会”，展览内容有华东人民出版社两年来所出版的宣传画、年画、连环画、连环画挂图、摄影挂图、摄影画册、艺术画册、画片等美术作品的部分原稿和印刷品共二百余种三百余件。展出期间并拟组织座谈活动，以密切作者、出版者和读者之间的联系。
    帮助小剧团解决剧本困难
    广东省、广州市戏曲改革委员会经常接到各地剧团来信，提出剧本缺乏问题，并请求帮助。该会将这一问题交由该会辅导的粤剧编剧者互助组进行讨论研究，并与有关的剧团进行了协商。现该会已订出了“粤剧剧本推广暂行办法”。办法规定：凡今后粤剧编剧者互助组同人编写的剧本，都愿意加以推广，各剧团均可依照规定手续提出申请上演；并规定上演推广剧本的剧团必须严肃对待演出。同时还订出第一批推广剧本共七十八部计有长剧“玉堂春”、“卓文君”等六十九部，短剧“借靴”、
  “拷红”等九部。该办法由八月起开始实行。（李　峄）
