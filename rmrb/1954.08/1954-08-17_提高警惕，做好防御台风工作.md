    Raise Vigilance and Do a Good Job in Typhoon Defense

    From May to mid-November every year, China's southeast coast is frequently threatened by violent typhoons from the Pacific Ocean. According to historical records, typhoons can occur in the Pacific Ocean from January to December; and the months when typhoons make landfall in China most frequently are July, August, and September. Areas hit by typhoons, especially on the left side of the typhoon's path, often experience heavy rain. After the wind force weakens, incessant rain often causes massive flooding.

    During the era of reactionary rule, because the reactionary rulers did not care about the safety of people's lives and property, typhoons brought serious disasters to coastal residents in China. The typhoon that struck Shantou on August 2, 1922, caused the tragic loss of 60,000 lives. After the liberation of the whole country, the Party and the People's Government launched a struggle focusing on organizing disaster prevention. Wind and flood prevention institutions in coastal provinces were established one after another, and a large number of storm warning stations were established in coastal areas to monitor typhoon movements. The central and local meteorological observatories along the coast can issue relatively accurate warnings before typhoons strike. The people's governments at all levels in the relevant areas organize and mobilize the masses to engage in the struggle to defend against typhoons based on meteorological warnings and have achieved certain results. However, because several typhoons had destructive power that could not be overcome by human power, and some cadres were negligent and did not take effective measures in time, some losses were also suffered. The statistical figures of these losses are, of course, vastly different compared to the deaths of more than 10,000 people in each major typhoon strike in the era of reactionary rule, but this also shows that the lives and property of our people are still being seriously threatened by typhoons. Some relevant cadres and the broad masses of people lack meteorological scientific knowledge and cannot correctly use the warnings issued by meteorological observatories. For example, salt workers in a certain area of Huaibei, Jiangsu Province, once mobilized to carry out prevention work when they heard a radio broadcast that a typhoon was about to hit Hainan Island, without clarifying the direction of the typhoon, causing a certain degree of waste and confusion. It is necessary to thoroughly publicize knowledge of typhoon defense to prevent the above phenomenon from happening again.

    It should be noted that in the past period of this year, the weather has been abnormal. Unprecedented heavy rains occurred in the Yangtze River area from May to July, and typhoons were particularly rare, only appearing twice in the southern sea in mid-May and early August, with relatively weak intensity. At present, the weather situation has changed. Typhoons in the Pacific Ocean may occur and strike the Chinese mainland at any time, and the floods in the Yangtze and Huai Rivers have not yet receded. The water level along the river in many areas still exceeds the highest historical record. If a typhoon occurs, the typhoon's wind force and the heavy rain it brings will have a serious impact on these areas. Therefore, areas threatened by typhoons along the coast and areas where floods have not receded must be doubly vigilant and make preparations for prevention.

    Now, the Central Meteorological Observatory has released news that a typhoon is threatening the coast of the East China Sea, and this period is also the time of high tides, especially in the coastal areas of Zhejiang. Relevant personnel should immediately prepare to fight the typhoon. First of all, meteorological staff should redouble their efforts to do a good job in meteorological measurement, reporting, and forecasting, and issue accurate news and warnings about typhoons in a timely manner. Broadcasting and telecommunications departments should further improve the timeliness of transmitting warnings. Relevant government departments and storm warning stations in typhoon-threatened areas should strengthen the work of listening to and transmitting warnings, and absolutely prevent the accumulation or misrepresentation of warning accidents. Relevant leading cadres should further study the content of the warnings and local conditions, and correctly arrange defense work. Each typhoon strikes different areas with different intensities, so absolute carelessness is not allowed. Wind and flood prevention institutions should vigorously consolidate organizations, clarify division of labor, seize favorable time, quickly investigate dangerous situations, and promptly inspect and prepare equipment; shipping and aquatic product departments should study and divide typhoon shelter areas in advance to avoid panic at the last minute. Other business departments should also pay attention to the wind and waterproof facilities of warehouses along the river and coast. Meteorological departments and governments at all levels should vigorously publicize typhoon prevention work to the masses so that the broad masses can grasp the typhoon situation and join the battle.

    Now we are about to overcome the largest flood in history. We have accumulated experience and achieved success in the struggle against natural disasters. We have the confidence and strength to prepare to defeat this year's typhoon attack once again.

### 提高警惕，做好防御台风工作

    提高警惕，做好防御台风工作
    每年五月到十一月中，我国东南沿海经常遭受来自太平洋的猛烈台风的威胁。根据历史记录，在太平洋上，从一月到十二月，均可出现台风；而台风在我国登陆次数最多的是七、八、九三个月份。台风经过的地区，特别是在台风路径的左侧，经常出现暴雨，在风力减弱以后，往往因降雨不止，造成巨大水灾。
    在反动统治时代，由于反动统治者不关心人民的生命财产的安全，台风曾给我国沿海居民带来严重的灾害。一九二二年八月二日一次台风袭击汕头，便造成六万人死亡的惨痛损失。全国解放以后，党和人民政府即开展着重组织防灾的斗争，沿海各省的防风防汛机构相继建立起来，并且在沿海地区建立了大批的暴风警报站，监视台风行动。中央和沿海各地的气象台都能在台风侵袭前发出比较正确的警报，有关地区的各级人民政府根据气象警报组织和动员广大群众，投入防御台风的斗争，取得了一定的成绩。但由于有几次台风具有人力不可克服的破坏力，和某些干部麻痹大意，没有及时采取有效措施，也曾遭受一些损失。这些损失的统计数字和反动统治时代在每次较大台风的侵袭下死亡万人以上相比，当然是有天壤之别，但是这也说明了我们的人民生命财产仍然在遭受着台风的严重威胁。还有一部分有关干部和广大群众缺乏气象科学的知识，不能正确地使用气象台所发出的警报，例如江苏省淮北某地的盐民过去就曾在收听到台风要袭击海南岛的广播时，没有弄清台风的动向，就动员起来进行预防工作，造成了一定的浪费和混乱。应该深入地宣传防御台风的知识，免得上述现象再度发生。
    应当注意的：在今年过去的一段时间里，天气反常，五至七月间在长江一带出现了有记录以来未曾出现过的暴雨，而台风特别稀少，只在五月中旬和八月上旬在南方海面上出现过两次强度较弱的台风。目前天气形势已经转变，太平洋上台风随时可能发生和袭击我国大陆，而长江、淮河洪水尚未退落，沿江水位在很多地区仍然超过历史上最高记录，假若台风一起，台风风力和它所带来的暴雨，将会对这些地区发生严重的影响。因此，沿海受台风威胁的地区和洪水未退的地区，必须加倍提高警惕，作好预防准备。
    现在，中央气象台已经发布了台风威胁我国东海沿岸的消息，而这个时期又是海上涨潮的时期，特别是浙江沿海地区。有关人员，应即进行和台风作战斗的准备。首先，气象部门工作人员应加倍努力做好气象测报和预报工作，及时发布有关台风的准确消息和警报，广播及电信部门应进一步提高传递警报的时效。受台风威胁地区的有关政府部门及暴风警报站应加强收听及传递警报的工作，绝对防止积压或误传警报事故。有关领导干部更应深刻研究警报内容及当地条件与情况，正确地布置防御工作。每个台风侵袭的地区不同，强弱程度不同，绝对不能马虎从事。防风防汛机构应大力巩固组织，明确分工，抓紧有利时间，迅速查清险象，及时检修和准备器材；航运、水产部门应预先研究并划分避风地区，以免临时张皇失措。其他企业部门亦应注意沿江沿海仓库的防风防水设施。气象部门及各级政府应大力向群众进行有关防台工作的宣传，使广大群众都能掌握台风情况投入战斗。
    现在我们即将战胜历史上最大的洪水，我们在和自然灾害作斗争中已积累了经验，取得了成绩，我们有信心也有力量准备再一次战胜今年台风的袭击。
