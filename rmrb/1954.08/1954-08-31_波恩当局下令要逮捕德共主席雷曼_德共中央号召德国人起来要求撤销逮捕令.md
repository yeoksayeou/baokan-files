Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 28th: According to a TASS report from Berlin on August 27th: The German News Agency reported that the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party (DKP) issued a statement regarding the issuance of an arrest warrant for Max Reimann.

The statement pointed out: The Adenauer government, through a court preliminary investigation official, issued an arrest warrant for Max Reimann, Chairman of the German Communist Party. The reason for issuing this arrest warrant is that Max Reimann published the "Program for Restoring German National Unity" in November 1952. This program is one for promoting mutual understanding among Germans. It calls for opposition to the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community," which threaten peace and the survival of the German people.

The statement pointed out: The arrest warrant for Max Reimann is an illegal infringement upon the German Communist Party and its leadership. Adenauer recognizes that the American "policy of strength" is in an unprecedented crisis. The footing of the representatives of the Bonn policy is wavering. It is precisely for this reason that the Karlsruhe judicial organs have been ordered to use intimidation and terror to oppose the defenders of the new German policy direction. This means of trampling on human rights and the law, on the one hand, exposes its anti-democratic essence, and on the other hand, demonstrates its weakness.

The statement said: The persecution of Max Reimann's freedom and the DKP leadership is aimed at all those who oppose Adenauer. Its spearhead is directed at everyone who hopes for a peaceful resolution of the German question and the signing of a peace treaty with Germany.

The statement concluded: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party calls on all Germans who recognize their responsibility to demand an end to police terror in West Germany and to demand the immediate revocation of the arrest warrant for Max Reimann.

    波恩当局下令要逮捕德共主席雷曼
    德共中央号召德国人起来要求撤销逮捕令
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十七日讯：德意志通讯社报道，德国共产党中央委员会书记处对颁布逮捕马克斯·雷曼的命令一事发表声明。
    声明指出：阿登纳政府通过法院预审官颁布了一项逮捕德国共产党主席马克斯·雷曼的命令。颁布这项逮捕命令的理由是：马克斯·雷曼一九五二年十一月发表了“争取恢复德国全国统一的纲领”。这一个纲领是争取德国人互相谅解的一个纲领。它号召反对威胁和平和德国人民生存的“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”。
    声明指出：对马克斯·雷曼的逮捕命令是对德国共产党和它的领导机构的非法侵害。阿登纳认识到美国的“实力政策”处于空前的危机之中。波恩政策的代表者的立脚点动摇了。正是由于这个缘故，加尔斯卢合的司法机关受命用威吓和恐怖的手段来反对德国新政策方针的保卫者。这种蹂躏人权和法律的手段一方面暴露了它的反民主本质，一方面也说明了它的软弱。
    声明说：对马克斯·雷曼的自由和对德共领导机构的迫害是针对着所有反对阿登纳的人的。它的矛头指向一切希望和平解决德国问题和签订对德和约的人。
    声明最后说：德国共产党中央委员会书记处号召所有认识到自己责任的德国人要求在西德停止警察的恐怖行动并要求立即撤销逮捕马克斯·雷曼的命令。
