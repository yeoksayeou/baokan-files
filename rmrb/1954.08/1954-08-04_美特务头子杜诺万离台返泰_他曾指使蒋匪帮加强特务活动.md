Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: American Ambassador to Thailand – the notorious intelligence chief Donovan, after carrying out three days of secret activities in Taiwan, left Taiwan for Thailand on July 31st. Information revealed indicates that Donovan's hurried trip to Taiwan after the ceasefire in Indochina was for a special mission. In addition to trying to arrange further military collusion between the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan and the pro-American traitorous clique in Thailand, and plotting to forcibly conscript overseas Chinese residing in Thailand as cannon fodder, he also instructed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to intensify espionage and sabotage activities against the Chinese mainland.

During his stay in Taiwan, Donovan held a series of secret meetings with the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek and other military and political leaders of the bandit gang, as well as senior American officials stationed in Taiwan; inspected the army, navy, and air force bases in Taiwan, and watched an amphibious landing exercise held especially for him. United Press also reported that he went to Dachen Island early in the morning of July 29th to "directly understand" the training and activities of the special armed forces dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to the Chinese mainland for harassment and sabotage. Some of Donovan's activities were so secretive that American officials stationed in Taiwan requested that news of his activities be restricted.

United Press International, Taipei, July 31st, reported: "Local observers" attach "great importance" to Donovan's activities in Taiwan. The report disclosed that Donovan had put forward "specific suggestions" to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to strengthen espionage activities against the Chinese mainland, and had exchanged views with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and American leaders stationed in Taiwan on "the role that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the pro-American traitorous clique in Thailand might play in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (American) repeatedly proposed."

    美特务头子杜诺万离台返泰
    他曾指使蒋匪帮加强特务活动
    【新华社三日讯】美国驻泰国大使——臭名远扬的特务头子杜诺万在台湾进行了三天秘密的活动以后，已于七月三十一日离台湾回泰国。从透露出来的消息显示，杜诺万在印度支那停火后匆匆跑到台湾，是负有特殊使命的。他除了力图安排台湾蒋介石匪帮和泰国亲美卖国集团在军事上作进一步的勾结和阴谋强征旅居泰国的华侨充当炮灰外，并曾指使蒋介石匪帮加紧对中国大陆进行特务破坏活动。
    杜诺万在台湾期间，曾和匪首蒋介石与匪帮其他军政首脑，以及美国驻台湾的高级官员进行一系列的秘密会商；巡视了台湾的陆、海、空军基地，并观看了专为他而举行的两栖登陆演习。合众社还传说他曾在七月二十九日清晨前往大陈岛去“直接了解”蒋匪帮派到中国大陆来进行骚扰、破坏的特务武装的训练和活动情况。杜诺万的有些活动是如此诡秘，以至驻台湾的美国官员要求对他的活动的消息加以限制。
    美国国际新闻社台北七月三十一日消息说：“本地观察家”对杜诺万在台湾的活动“非常重视”。消息披露，杜诺万已向蒋介石匪帮提出加强对中国大陆进行特务活动的“具体建议”，并已就蒋介石匪帮和泰国亲美卖国集团“在（美国）再三建议的东南亚公约组织中可能起的作用一事”，和蒋介石匪帮及驻台湾美国首领们交换了意见。
