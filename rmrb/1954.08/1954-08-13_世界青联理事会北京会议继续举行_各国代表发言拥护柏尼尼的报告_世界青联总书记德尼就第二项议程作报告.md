　　Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: The Beijing meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council continued its general discussion on the first agenda item on the afternoon of August 11th.
　　Delegates and observers from fifteen countries spoke at the meeting. A representative of the World Peace Council also addressed the meeting to offer congratulations.
　　In their speeches, delegates from various countries first expressed their respect for the glorious achievements of the Chinese people in their struggle for national liberation and the significant role they played in safeguarding world peace. Representatives from African, Middle Eastern, and Near Eastern countries stated in their speeches that the path taken by the liberated Chinese people was their model.
　　All speakers supported Bernini's report on the first agenda item.
　　In the earlier part of the meeting, representatives from Senegal, Germany, Lebanon, Cameroon, France, Cyprus, Martinique, and Turkey spoke successively.
　　The female representative from Turkey, Güngör Togay, indignantly said that Turkey has now virtually become a colony of the United States, filled with the misery of poverty, disease, and unemployment. She pointed out that because Turkey has been and will be ruthlessly dragged into the "Atlantic Pact," the "Balkan Pact," and the "European Defense Community" by American warmongers, Turkish youth, if they do not immediately awaken and oppose war, will become sacrifices of American war policies.
　　Amidst thunderous applause, Qian Sanqiang, a guest attending the meeting and a representative of the World Peace Council, took the stage to deliver a congratulatory speech.
　　Qian Sanqiang said that the World Peace Council calls on peace-loving people all over the world, regardless of nationality, political views, or religious beliefs, to unite and stop war and safeguard peace. This is also the goal pursued by the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The World Peace Council, along with all conscientious people around the world, actively and enthusiastically supports the struggle of the younger generation for peace and a bright future.
　　He concluded by wishing the meeting success and greater victories in the cause of uniting the youth of all countries to defend peace and strive for national independence.
　　After the Israeli representative, Haim Goldstein, spoke, the executive chairman announced that the Soviet representative, Sergey Romanovsky, chairman of the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, would speak. The entire audience stood up and applauded for a long time.
　　In his speech, Romanovsky pointed out: "For many years, the people of Southeast Asia, the Near and Middle East, Africa, and Latin America have been constantly striving for national independence, striving to establish on their own land a system based on the principles of national sovereignty and reflecting the interests of the people. However, the ruling groups of certain countries, primarily the United States, are still attempting to maintain their crumbling colonial system at all costs. To achieve this goal, the colonizers use all means, from sweet talk of 'friendship' and granting false freedom to suppressing the people who demand independence by force."
　　However, "the aggressive policies of the colonialists are being met with increasingly resolute resistance from the people of the colonies and dependent countries who demand peace and national independence. The youth movement in the colonies and dependent countries has greatly developed and strengthened, many new youth organizations have been established, and the ranks of existing organizations that represent the interests of the broad masses of youth have grown."
　　He said: The struggle of the great Chinese people for national independence has been victorious. The birth of the People's Republic of China, its example of striving for national independence, its outstanding role in consolidating the cause of peace, the heroic struggle of the Korean and Indochinese people for national independence and liberation from colonial enslavement, India, which was not long ago a colony, taking the political stage, and the struggle of countries such as Burma and Indonesia for complete national independence, all demonstrate the fundamental changes taking place in the political development of the colonies and dependent countries. The people of these countries are fighting for the right to their country's independent existence and the right to implement their own independent policies.
　　He then pointed out: "The World Federation of Democratic Youth and youth organizations in various countries still face enormous tasks on the issue of the youth movement in the colonies and dependent countries. The youth of the colonies and dependent countries are waging a heroic struggle for peace, for their country's national independence, and for basic human rights. We fully support the suggestion that the World Federation of Democratic Youth and millions of young men and women in various countries should give the warmest support to this noble struggle.
　　"It is believable that discussing the issue of the youth movement in the colonies and dependent countries at the meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council will help to further smoothly carry out the struggle of the youth of the colonies and dependent countries for peace, for national independence, and for a bright future."
　　He concluded by saying: "The youth of our multi-ethnic country are faithful to the belief in peace and friendship among all peoples. These youth have always supported and will continue to support the just demands of young men and women in the colonies and dependent countries. We sincerely hope that the youth of these countries will achieve victory in the struggle for peace, freedom, for the independence of their nations, and for a bright future."
　　Subsequently, the following spoke at the meeting: representatives from Morocco, an observer from Sweden, the Syrian representative, Mahmoud Aga, and the Indian representative, Ganguly, among others.
　　Finally, the Korean representative, Kim Ki-soo, spoke, first repeatedly thanking the Chinese people and youth for their support of Korea. Then he forcefully stated: "The Korean people do not want war! Whether in the past or now, the peaceful reunification of our homeland is the unanimous desire of all Korean people. The American imperialists are answering the consistent efforts and unanimous wishes of the Korean people to achieve peaceful reunification and the independence of the motherland with aggressive war."
　　He then said: "The entire process of the Korean War proves that the people and the armed forces of the people who have seized power and resolutely risen up to crush the enemy are invincible. The Korean War proves that people who are fighting for their own justice, freedom, and peace can receive the active support of peace-loving people in the world, and the people who receive this support are invincible. This is the main lesson of the Korean War, and this is also the firm belief of the Korean youth who have dedicated their lives and blood."
　　"The Korean War once again proves that the era of intimidation and extortion by the American imperialists' policy of strength and enslavement of foreign countries is forever over."
　　When the Korean representative finished speaking, the entire audience stood up and applauded continuously. Male and female members of the American delegation presented flowers and warmly embraced the heroic Korean representative, and the applause became even louder with this moving scene.
　　Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: The Beijing meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council continued its general session on the morning of August 12th to discuss the first agenda item. At the meeting, all the delegates also listened to the report by the Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Jacques Denis, on the second agenda item, entitled: "The World Federation of Democratic Youth and its member organizations participate in the preparations for the International Rural Youth Conference." The afternoon session was devoted to group discussions.
　　Two hundred and forty-two delegates, observing members and guests representing sixty-eight countries attended the meeting.
　　At the morning meeting, all delegates listened with great interest to the speeches of delegates from twelve countries. They were: Iranian representative Telani, Japanese representative Tochikata Yohira, Cuban representative Eduardo Toledo, Egyptian representative Mahmoud Abu Sand, Chilean representative Napoleon Taller Alasenna, Laotian representative Lo Phung, representative from the Portuguese colonies Carlos Migaja, Paraguayan representative Sixto Somes, Triestine representative Ranselli Lucianno, Bolivian representative Falhat, Cambodian representative Samson, and the Greek representative. In their speeches, the delegates from various countries unanimously expressed their support for Bernini's report, and once again expressed the strong will of the youth of the colonial dependent countries to fight against colonial oppression and strive for national independence. The delegates from various countries were also delighted and encouraged by the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people and youth, and thanked the great Chinese people for their warm hospitality.
　　The representative of the International Student Union, Mukul, also spoke at the meeting, congratulating the success of the meeting and presenting a gift to the Council of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which was warmly welcomed.
　　Then, the Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Jacques Denis, walked onto the stage amidst warm applause and gave a report to the delegates on the second agenda item, entitled: "The World Federation of Democratic Youth and its member organizations participate in the preparations for the International Rural Youth Conference."
　　After first describing the poverty of rural youth in capitalist countries and colonial dependent countries, Jacques Denis said that many rural youth are increasingly clear that the deterioration of their situation is related to the government of some countries being keen on the arms race, increasing military expenditure, and打击打击(dǎ jī) the independence of the people of various countries.
　　Denis said that the initiative of the rural youth of Sant'Alberto, Ravenna province, Italy to convene the International Rural Youth Conference is completely justified. The Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth held in Stockholm in January 1954 responded to the appeal made by the youth of Sant'Alberto, Ravenna province, to the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and other international organizations, and decided to fully support this initiative. The Executive Committee did so correctly reflected the feelings of millions of youth. The World Federation of Democratic Youth's concern for this conference has been consistent from the beginning with the concern of various organizations, and of prominent figures representing many countries, various political views and religious beliefs for this conference. On this basis of general agreement, the International Preparatory Committee held a meeting in early April this year at the Williven Ding Agricultural School in Denmark. The establishment of the International Preparatory Committee is an important step in the preparations for the International Rural Youth Conference. The deeply united spirit of the appeal formulated by the Preparatory Committee has spread throughout the major continents of the world. Denis also described in detail the enthusiastic preparations of the youth of various countries in response to this call, and the active support of various international organizations and youth from all walks of life for this call. He said: A prominent feature of the many and varied forms of activities adopted in the preparation of the International Rural Youth Conference is that rural youth combine their economic and cultural demands with the basic struggle of the people and the younger generation for peace, national independence and important freedoms. Rural youth deeply desire peace, because most of the conscripted soldiers are them.
　　Denis pointed out that we believe that we should learn from the groups that carry out different activities for various rural youth classes according to the different circumstances of each country. The Council should suggest increasing this kind of activity that all related youth can participate in, facing young agricultural workers, tenant farmers, children of small landowners, agricultural students, young women, vegetable growers, flower growers, mountain residents, grape growers, etc...and note the very different circumstances in each region. These activities can be carried out on a common basis, or according to different circumstances, only in the member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, so as to provide preliminary contributions to the preparation work. These activities are very suitable for争取(zhēng qǔ) the unorganized rural youth, because this kind of youth still accounts for the majority of rural youth, and the significance of this conference should be widely promoted,争取(zhēng qǔ) all rural youth, and even the world's youth, to participate in this activity.
　　Denis said that the vast masses of rural youth, whether they have joined our organization or not, whether they are Communists or Socialists, Liberals or Conservatives, Catholics or Christians, Muslims or Buddhists, whether they have joined any organization or not, are in fact in the backward state of the countryside. And the youth in the cities share their worries, understand their difficulties, and increasingly understand the consistency of their mutual interests and the necessity of common struggle. We are willing to discuss and cooperate with all those who are concerned about the happiness and peaceful future of rural youth. We ask all member organizations, immediately after the end of this Council, to more bravely and frankly discuss common problems with the youth organizations that have not yet participated in the preparations for the International Rural Youth Conference, and find the scope for practical cooperation in this regard, even on a few limited points.
　　Denis finally said that we support the proposal of several members of the International Preparatory Committee to hold the International Rural Youth Conference in Vienna, Austria from December 9th to 15th this year. That is to say, there are less than four months left before this grand gathering, and if we want the meeting to be successful, we should not waste every day and every hour. In the process of preparing these activities, the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the member organizations of various countries have gained new strength among rural youth, and its prestige has also improved, because rural youth judge based on actions, and will give trust when they understand who their true defenders are. Please allow us to wish in advance that the results of our preparations for this great and united event in the coming days will enable our World Federation of Democratic Youth to gain the respect and support of millions of new rural youth.
　　When Denis finished his report, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly.
　　The meeting was divided into two groups in the afternoon for group discussions on the first agenda item.

　　世界青联理事会北京会议继续举行
　　各国代表发言拥护柏尼尼的报告
　　世界青联总书记德尼就第二项议程作报告
    【新华社十一日讯】世界民主青年联盟理事会北京会议在十一日下午继续进行第一项议程的大会讨论。
    在大会上发言的有十五个国家的代表和列席代表。还有世界和平理事会代表在会上致词祝贺。
    在各国代表发言时，都首先向中国人民在争取民族解放斗争中所获得的光辉成就和在保卫世界和平事业中所起的重大作用表示敬意。非洲和中、近东各国代表在发言中表示：获得解放了的中国人民所走过的道路，就是他们的榜样。
    全体发言者都拥护柏尼尼关于第一项议程的报告。
    在会议的前一段时间，有塞内加尔代表班居、德国代表阿·穆勒、黎巴嫩代表阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·穆罗埃、喀麦隆代表埃内斯特·昂迪埃、法国列席代表安德烈·欧仁·德韦兹、塞浦路斯代表奥林比奥斯、马提尼克代表奥古斯特·弗伦、土耳其代表古恩·托加伊相继发言。
    土耳其的女代表古恩·托加伊愤慨地说，土耳其现在实际上已成为美国的殖民地，在这里充满了贫苦、疾病和失业的惨象。她指出：由于土耳其已被和将被美国战争贩子凶恶地拉入“大西洋公约”、“巴尔干公约”和“欧洲防务集团”，因而土耳其青年如果不立即觉悟起来反对战争，我们就会成为美国战争政策的牺牲品。
    在雷动般的掌声中，出席会议的来宾、世界和平理事会代表钱三强上台向会议致祝词。
    钱三强说，世界和平理事会号召全世界爱好和平的人们，不分民族、政治见解和宗教信仰，一致团结起来，制止战争、保卫和平。这也是世界民主青年联盟所要争取的目标。世界和平理事会和全世界有良心的人们一道，积极地、热烈地支持青年一代争取和平和美好将来的斗争。
    他最后祝会议成功，祝在团结各国青年保卫和平、争取民族独立的事业中获得更大的胜利。
    当以色列代表海姆·戈尔茨坦发言后，执行主席宣布苏联代表、苏联青年反法西斯委员会主席谢尔盖·罗马诺夫斯基发言。全场起立，响起经久不息的掌声。
    罗马诺夫斯基发言中指出：“许多年来，东南亚、近东和中东、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的人民不断争取着民族独立，争取在自己的国土上建立起以民族主权原则为基础的并反映人民利益的制度。但是，某些国家，首先是美国的统治集团还在企图不惜任何代价来保持其摇摇欲坠的殖民制度。为了达到这一目的，殖民者利用一切手段，从花言巧语的‘友好’，给与虚伪的自由，一直到用武力镇压要求独立的人民。”
    可是，“殖民者的侵略政策遭到要求和平与民族独立的殖民地和附属国家人民愈益坚决的反抗。殖民地和附属国家的青年运动大大发展和加强了，许多新的青年组织成立起来了，那些代表广大青年群众利益的原有组织的队伍壮大了。”
    他说：伟大中国人民争取民族独立的斗争取得了胜利。中华人民共和国的诞生，它的争取民族独立斗争的榜样，它在巩固和平事业中的杰出作用，朝鲜和印度支那人民争取民族独立和摆脱殖民地奴役制度的英勇斗争，不久以前还是殖民地的印度的走上政治舞台，像缅甸和印度尼西亚这样一些国家的争取完全民族独立的斗争，所有这一切都说明了殖民地和附属国家在政治发展上发生的根本变化。这些国家的人民正在争取自己国家独立存在的权利和实行本国独立政策的权利。
    接着他又指出：“世界民主青年联盟和各国青年组织在殖民地和附属国的青年运动问题上，仍面临着巨大的任务。殖民地和附属国的青年正为争取和平、争取本国民族独立和起码的人权进行着英勇的斗争。我们完全支持世界民主青年联盟和各国千百万青年男女应当对这个崇高的斗争予以最热烈支持的建议。
    “可以相信，在世界民主青年联盟理事会会议上讨论殖民地和附属国家的青年运动问题，是有助于进一步顺利开展殖民地和附属国家青年为和平、为民族独立、为美好未来而进行的斗争。”
    他最后说：“我们多民族国家的青年是忠实于和平与各国人民之间友谊这一信念的，这些青年始终支持，今后仍将支持殖民地和附属国家青年男女的正义要求。我们真诚地期望这些国家的青年们在为和平、自由、为自己民族的独立、为美好未来的斗争中获得胜利。”
    随后在会上相继发言的，有：摩洛哥代表、瑞典列席代表、叙利亚代表马茂德·阿加和印度代表甘古利等。
    最后朝鲜代表金基洙发言，他首先再三感谢中国人民和青年对朝鲜的支援。然后他强有力地说明：“朝鲜人民不要战争！不论过去和现在，和平统一我们祖国是全朝鲜人民的一致愿望。美帝国主义者是以侵略战争来回答朝鲜人民为达到和平统一和祖国独立的一贯努力和一致愿望的。”
    接着他说：“朝鲜战争的全部过程证明，取得了政权并坚决起来粉碎敌人的人民和人民的武装力量是不可战胜的。朝鲜战争证明，为自己正义、自由、和平而斗争的人民是能够得到世界上爱好和平人们的积极支援的，人民得到了这种支援就是不可战胜的。这就是朝鲜战争的主要教训，这也是献出自己生命和鲜血的朝鲜青年的坚定信念。”
    “朝鲜战争再一次证明，美帝国主义者的实力政策的恐吓讹诈并奴役外国的时代永远成为过去了。”
    朝鲜代表发言结束时，全场起立不断鼓掌。美国代表团男女团员们向英雄的朝鲜代表敬献鲜花和热情拥抱，掌声也随着这一动人的情景而更加响亮。
    【新华社十二日讯】世界民主青年联盟理事会北京会议十二日上午继续举行大会，进行关于第一项议程的讨论。会上，全体代表并听取了世界民主青年联盟总书记雅克·德尼关于第二项议程的报告，题目是：世界民主青年联盟及其会员组织参加国际农村青年大会的筹备工作。下午会议进行小组讨论。
    出席会议的有六十八个国家的代表、列席观察员和来宾二百四十二人。
    在上午的会议上，全体代表以浓厚的兴趣听取了十二个国家代表的发言。他们是：伊朗代表特拉尼、日本代表土方与平、古巴代表爱德华多·托列多、埃及代表马茂德·阿布·桑德、智利代表拿破仑·陶勒·阿拉森那、寮国代表罗逢、葡萄牙殖民地代表卡略斯·米加哈、巴拉圭代表西克斯托·索麦斯、的里雅斯特代表朗塞利·卢契安诺、玻利维亚代表法尔哈特、高棉代表桑森和希腊代表等。各国代表在发言中，一致表示拥护柏尼尼的报告，并再一次表示了殖民地附属国青年为反对殖民压迫、争取民族独立而斗争的坚强意志。各国代表还为中国人民和青年所取得的辉煌胜利而欢欣鼓舞，感谢伟大的中国人民对他们的热情款待。
    国际学生联合会代表穆库尔也在会上讲话，祝贺会议成功，并向世界民主青年联盟理事会献礼，受到热烈欢迎。
    接着，世界民主青年联盟总书记雅克·德尼在热烈的掌声中走上讲台，向代表们作关于第二项议程的报告，题目是：世界民主青年联盟及其会员组织参加国际农村青年大会的筹备工作。
    雅克·德尼在首先叙述了资本主义国家和殖民地附属国农村青年的贫困情况后说，很多农村青年都越来越清楚地看出：他们的情况的日益恶化与某些国家的政府热中于军备竞赛、增加军费开支以及打击各国人民的独立是有关系的。
    德尼说，意大利拉温那省圣塔尔贝托农村青年倡议召开国际农村青年大会是完全有理由的。一九五四年一月在斯德哥尔摩召开的世界民主青年联盟执行委员会会议响应了拉温那省圣塔尔贝托青年向世界民主青年联盟执行委员会和其他国际组织发出的呼吁，并决定全力支持这个倡议。执行委员会这样做是正确地反映了千百万青年的感情的。世界民主青年联盟对这个大会所表现的关心，一开始就是与各种组织，与代表许多国家、各种政治见解及宗教信仰的各界著名人士对这个大会的关心相一致的。在这种大家赞同的基础上，今年四月初国际筹备委员会就在丹麦威利文定农业学校里举行了会议。国际筹备委员会的成立是国际农村青年大会筹备工作中的一个重要步骤。筹备委员会所制订的贯彻着深刻的团结精神的号召，已传遍了世界各大洲。德尼并详尽地叙述了各国青年响应这一号召进行筹备工作的热烈情况，和这一号召得到各国际组织，社会各界青年积极支持的情况。他说：筹备国际农村青年大会所采取的许多各种形式的活动的一个显著特点，就是农村青年把他们在经济上和文化上的要求和人民及青年一代争取和平、民族独立和重要的自由的基本斗争结合在一起。农村青年深切地希望和平，因为大部分的被征的士兵就是他们。
    德尼指出，我们认为，应当根据各个国家的不同情况，向那些为各个不同的农村青年阶层进行不同活动的团体学习。理事会应该建议增加这种一切有关青年都能够参加的活动，面向青年农业工人、佃农、小土地所有者的子女、农业学生、女青年、种菜者、种花者、山村居民、葡萄种植者等等……并注意到各个地区非常不同的情况。这些活动可以在共同的基础上进行，或者根据不同的情况，仅在世界民主青年联盟会员组织中进行，从而为筹备工作提供初步的贡献。这些活动在争取没有组织起来的农村青年是非常合适的，因为这种青年还占农村青年的大部分，应广泛宣传这次大会的意义，争取所有农村青年，乃至全世界青年，都参加这次活动。
    德尼说，广大的农村青年群众，不管是否已经加入了我们的组织，不管是共产党人或社会党人、自由党人或保守党人、天主教徒或基督教徒、回教徒或佛教徒，不管是否加入任何组织，事实上都处在乡村的落后状态之中。而城市的青年分担着他们的忧虑，了解他们的困难，并且越来越懂得他们彼此的利益的一致性以及共同斗争的必要性。我们是愿意和一切关心农村青年幸福与和平未来的人们，共同讨论、彼此合作的。我们要求各会员组织，在这次理事会结束以后立即更勇敢地和各个还没有参加国际农村青年大会筹备工作的青年组织，直率地讨论共同的问题，找出在这一方面可以实际合作的余地，即使是在某些有限的几点上。
    德尼最后说，我们支持国际筹备委员会的几位委员所提出于今年十二月九日至十五日在奥地利的维也纳举行国际农村青年大会的建议。这就是说，现在距离这一盛大的集会还不到四个月了，如果我们愿意会议获得成功，就不应浪费每一天和每一个钟头的时间。在筹备这些活动的过程中，世界民主青年联盟和各国的会员组织，已经在农村青年中间得到了新的力量，它的威信也提高了，因为农村青年是根据行动来判断的，当他们了解到谁是他们真正的保卫者的时候，才会赋予信任。请允许我们预祝在即将到来的日子里，我们为这一伟大的、团结的活动进行筹备的结果会使我们世界民主青年联盟得到数百万新的农村青年的尊重和支持。
    德尼报告结束时，全场起立，热烈鼓掌。
    会议在下午分两个小组进行关于第一项议程的小组讨论。
