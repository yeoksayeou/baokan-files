Liberating Taiwan is the Sacred Task of the Chinese People
Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee

Taiwan is Chinese territory.

Sixty years ago, during the Sino-Japanese War, the then-Qing government was defeated by Japanese imperialism and once ceded Taiwan to Japan. For decades, the compatriots living in Taiwan shed much blood fighting Japanese imperialism, hoping to return to the embrace of the motherland. In 1945, after eight years of large-scale military aggression against mainland China, Japan was finally defeated and surrendered, and the ardent hopes of the Taiwan compatriots for decades were realized. Unfortunately, however, when they returned to the embrace of the motherland, they encountered the heinous fascist rule of Chiang Kai-shek.

In 1949, Chiang Kai-shek's fascist rule on the mainland, heavily supported by the US government, was overthrown by the Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek and his remaining bandit gang fled to Taiwan under the protection of the United States, entrenched there to maintain his lingering fascist regime, and under the command of the American aggressors, continued his traitorous activities of selling out the motherland.

In 1950, the American aggressors launched a war of aggression against Korea, intensified their intervention in the war in Indochina, and at the same time sent their Seventh Fleet to patrol the Taiwan Strait, providing armed protection to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and actually occupied our sacred territory of Taiwan.

The aim of the American aggressor group is very clear. Their long-standing attempt has been to completely colonize China. The Chinese people overthrew the traitorous regime it supported and gained freedom and independence, which of course displeased the American aggressor group. Therefore, it has tried every possible means to obstruct and undermine the national construction of the Chinese people, using various methods to antagonize and encircle our country, attempting to subvert our government, restore Chiang Kai-shek in China, and thereby restore American rule over China. Aggression against Korea, intervention in the war in Indochina, occupation of Taiwan, and even the intensification of arming Japan are all measures to expand armed interference in China and undermine peace in the Far East.

The American aggressor group stubbornly refuses to face the fact that Asian history has fundamentally changed. But no matter how you close your eyes, the sun is rising day by day. The Chinese people have stood up. The people of many countries in Asia have also stood up. Trying to put the shackles of colonialism back on the liberated Chinese and Asian people is a complete dream!

Now the American aggressors' plan to conquer all of Korea has failed, and their plot to expand the Indochina war and internationalize it has also failed. The American aggressors are intensifying their perverse actions. They are constantly clamoring and acting recklessly, wanting to organize a so-called "defense group" in Southeast Asia, and also wanting to organize a so-called "defense alliance" in Northeast Asia. Their defense line is truly vast and boundless, and the entire Pacific Ocean seems to have become an American inland sea. Can this ambition withstand scrutiny?

Protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country is the sacred task of the Chinese people. To protect the sovereignty of the country, we must eliminate the traitors. To protect the territorial integrity, we must resist the aggressors. The Chinese mainland has long been liberated, and only Taiwan is still entrenched by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique under the armed protection of the American aggressors. The American aggressors are occupying Taiwan, allowing Chiang Kai-shek to implement bloody rule in Taiwan. At the same time, it directs Chiang Kai-shek to continuously conduct harassing and destructive military actions against the Chinese mainland and coastal islands, and at sea, it completely adopts piracy, attacking and looting ships from various countries that come to our country for trade. Although Chiang Kai-shek is the actor in these lawless acts, the director and commander is the American aggressor group, which is an open secret known to the people of the world. The American director sometimes even performs in person. Recently, the US Air Force attacked the airspace over Hainan Island and shot down two of our aircraft, which is proof of the fact.

The fact that the American aggressor group has been instigating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to wage war against the Chinese people with Taiwan as a base has long existed. The security of the motherland is threatened, the security of the Pacific is threatened, and the peace of the entire Asia and the world is threatened. Therefore, we must liberate Taiwan. Our liberation of Taiwan is to protect the security of the motherland, protect the security of the Pacific, and protect Asian and world peace.

Liberating Taiwan is, without a doubt, the sacred task of the Chinese people.

To accomplish this sacred task, all of us Chinese people must make efforts in many ways.

First of all, we must strengthen internal unity. We know that unity is strength. The enemy also knows that destroying our unity is to disintegrate our strength. All democratic parties, people's organizations, fraternal nationalities, and democratic people from all walks of life in our country must heighten their vigilance, be determined, guard against arrogance and impatience, and be realistic. We must unite more closely around Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, uniting as one person like "the body uses the arm, and the arm uses the finger" to deal with this central task of ours. Soon, our National People's Congress will be convened, and our first people's constitution in history will be promulgated. We must strive to make the National People's Congress a success, and we must all abide by the constitution wholeheartedly and be loyal to the motherland. This is the main way to strengthen domestic unity. Our internal unity can be continuously strengthened, and our strength to liberate Taiwan and defend peace can also be continuously strengthened.

Secondly, liberating Taiwan is not a purely military task. We must work hard in many ways. In addition to military construction, construction work in the political, legal, economic, cultural, and educational fields must also be carried out with equal strength. Workers must increase industrial production in order to liberate Taiwan. Farmers must increase agricultural production in order to liberate Taiwan. Students and young people must study hard and exercise diligently in order to liberate Taiwan. Anyone in any job position must strive to do their job well, practice thrift, increase patriotic enthusiasm, and ensure the overfulfillment of planned tasks in order to liberate Taiwan, and promote the speed of national socialist industrialization. As the strength of the country continues to grow, our strength to liberate Taiwan and defend peace will continue to grow.

Thirdly, in order to liberate Taiwan, we must strengthen ties with international friends. Liberating Taiwan is to protect Asian and world peace, which the peace-loving people of the world can understand. The American aggressor group's endless acts of aggression must be condemned and stopped. In recent years, the peace-loving people of the world have gradually and clearly seen through the deception of the American aggressor group. The so-called "preventing communist aggression" and the so-called "collective defense" are nothing more than a guise for the American aggressor group to actually carry out aggression. We should win over more friends of peace and isolate the warmongers. Especially for the peace-loving American people, we should further extend a hand of friendship. We oppose American aggressors, but we do not oppose the American people. American aggressors are also the enemies of the American people. The American people stand on the same front as us, and should be on the front line. If the American people can resolutely stop the aggressive actions of American warmongers, world peace will be more easily guaranteed.

Therefore, I want to appeal to the American people. The American people have a glorious history of breaking the shackles of colonialism. We know that the American people have always respected the traditions of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln. But today, the actions of American warmongers are inheriting the mantle of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki. They bring great danger to the people of Asia and the world, and also bring great danger to the American people. Countries around the world can coexist peacefully. American warmongers, in order to greed for the bloody profits of war, must plan confrontation, carry out aggression, and expand armaments. This not only increases the world's crisis, but also directly threatens the safety of the American people. May I ask: What harm has American security suffered from China? Has our Chinese People's Liberation Army occupied Hawaii? If our People's Liberation Army went to your Hawaii, not to mention Long Island near Washington, American friends, how would you feel? Would you agree that this is a Chinese "defense behavior"? Would you be safe and sound and indifferent? The American aggressor group is occupying our Taiwan today, and we believe that the peace-loving American people will also think it is unjust. For the sake of America's own interests and the glory of the people, and for the happiness of mankind, the American people have a major responsibility to quickly stop the actions of American warmongers.

We Chinese people have always loved peace. Today, we are concentrating our efforts to build our motherland into a socialist country, and we especially respect peace. Our government and people are willing to coexist peacefully with all countries in the world on the basis of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit. We will never invade others, but we will never tolerate the invasion of others. Today, American warmongers are occupying our Taiwan and directing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to carry out various sinful military actions. Our sovereignty is being infringed, our territorial integrity is being destroyed, and our internal affairs are being interfered with. This is absolutely intolerable to us. We must liberate Taiwan, and we must eliminate Chiang Kai-shek. This is our just and sacred task. We believe that all peace-loving and righteous American people and people all over the world can understand.

It goes without saying that the liberation of Taiwan is also the urgent demand of patriotic Taiwan compatriots. Patriotic Taiwan compatriots fought for decades under the colonial rule of the old Japanese imperialism, and also held the "February 28th" resistance struggle under the fascist rule of Chiang Kai-shek. Today, we can understand the urgent desire for liberation of Taiwan compatriots who are trapped in the disaster of deep water and hot fire. Patriotic Taiwan compatriots, please continue your efforts! The brothers on the mainland have not forgotten you. We are by the iron smelting furnace, we are by the tractor, we are grazing on the Horqin grassland, and we are exploring under Mount Everest, and we have not forgotten you. The first thought we have every morning when we wake up is to liberate Taiwan! Patriotic Taiwan compatriots, let us work together to smash the double chains that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and the American aggressor group have placed on you!

We Chinese people are not warlike, we Chinese people are magnanimous. Even for the small group of traitors of Chiang Kai-shek, we are prepared to treat them differently. All those who still have a conscience and a sense of shame, all those who still have a love for the motherland, as long as they are unwilling to die as martyrs for Chiang Kai-shek, have the opportunity to perform meritorious service and redeem their sins. Whether you are going to be a glorious Chinese again, or continue to be a despicable American lackey, the time has come for you to make a quick choice.

Justice belongs to us, and victory will surely belong to us.

Compatriots across the country, unite more firmly and strive to accomplish the sacred task of liberating Taiwan!

    解放台湾是中国人民的神圣任务
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席  郭沫若
    台湾是中国的领土。
    六十年前的中日之战，当时的满清政府被日本帝国主义打败了，曾经一次把台湾割让给日本。几十年来住在台湾的同胞们流了不少的鲜血和日本帝国主义斗争，想归还祖国的怀抱。一九四五年，日本在对中国大陆进行了八年的大规模军事侵略之后，终于被击败而投降了，台湾同胞们的几十年来的殷切希望才得以实现。然而不幸的是：当他们回到祖国的怀抱时，所遭遇到的正是蒋介石的万恶的法西斯统治。
    一九四九年，受着美国政府大力支持的蒋介石的法西斯统治在大陆上被中国人民推翻了。蒋介石和他的残余匪帮便在美国的庇护下逃往台湾，盘据在那儿维持着他的苟延残喘的法西斯政权，在美国侵略者的指挥之下，继续进行着他的出卖祖国的勾当。
    一九五○年，美国侵略者发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，加紧了对于印度支那战争的干预，而同时更派遣了他们的第七舰队巡逻台湾海峡，对于蒋介石卖国集团实行武装保护，把我们的神圣的领土台湾，实际上占领了起来。
    美国侵略集团的目的是十分明显的。他们很早以来的企图就是要把中国彻底殖民地化。中国人民推翻了它所支持的卖国政权而获得自由独立，当然是美国侵略集团所不高兴的。因而它千方百计地想阻挠和破坏中国人民的国家建设事业，用种种方法来敌视和包围我们的国家，企图颠覆我国政府，令蒋介石在中国复辟，从而恢复美国对于中国的统治。侵略朝鲜，干预印度支那战争，侵占台湾，乃至加紧武装日本，这一连串的措施，都是想扩大对于中国的武装干涉，而破坏远东的和平。
    美国侵略集团对于亚洲历史已经起了根本改变的事实，是顽固地不肯正视的。但尽你怎样把眼睛闭着，而太阳却在日益上升。中国人民是站起来了。亚洲好些国家的人民也站起来了。想把殖民地的枷锁从新套在解放了的中国人民和亚洲人民的头上，那完全是梦想！
    现在美国侵略者想征服全部朝鲜的计划是失败了，想扩大印度支那战争而使它国际化的阴谋也失败了，美国侵略者正在变本加厉地继续倒行逆施。他们不断地叫嚣而且蠢动，想在东南亚组织一个所谓“防务集团”，又想在东北亚组织一个所谓“防务联盟”，他们的防卫线真是广大无边，一个整个的太平洋都仿佛成了美国的内海。这野心还经得住戳穿吗？
    保卫国家的主权和领土的完整是中国人民神圣的任务。要保卫国家的主权就必须消除卖国贼。要保卫领土的完整就必须反抗侵略者。中国大陆早经解放了，就只有台湾还被蒋介石卖国集团在美国侵略者的武装保护之下盘据着。美国侵略者侵占着台湾，让蒋介石在台湾施行着血腥的统治。同时它又指挥蒋介石不断地对中国大陆和沿海岛屿进行着骚扰性的和破坏性的军事行动，而在海上则完全采取海盗行为，袭击并劫夺世界各国前来我国通商贸易的船舶。这些无法无天的行为，扮演者虽然是蒋介石，而导演者和指挥者则是美国侵略集团，这是全世界人民都知道的公开秘密。美国导演者有时甚至亲自表演，最近美国的空军袭击我海南岛上空，并击落我飞机两架，便是事实的证明。
    美国侵略集团指使蒋介石卖国集团以台湾为根据地对中国人民进行战争的事实早就是存在着的。祖国的安全受着威胁，太平洋上的安全受着威胁，整个亚洲和平与世界和平都受着威胁。因此，我们必须解放台湾。我们解放台湾，就是保卫祖国的安全，保卫太平洋上的安全，保卫亚洲和平与世界和平。
    解放台湾，毫无疑问，是中国人民的神圣任务。
    要完成这项神圣任务，我们全中国人民必须从多方面来进行努力。
    首先我们要加强内部团结。我们知道，团结就是力量。敌人也知道，破坏我们的团结就是瓦解我们的力量。我们全国各民主党派、各人民团体、各兄弟民族、各阶层各方面的民主人士，都必须提高警惕，抱定决心，戒骄戒躁，实事求是。我们必须更加紧密地团结在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的周围，如像“身之使臂、臂之使指”地团结成一个人那样，来应付我们这项中心任务。不久我们的全国人民代表大会会议就要召开了，我们的有史以来的第一部人民宪法就要颁布了。我们必须努力把人民代表大会会议开好，我们必须全体一心遵守宪法，效忠于祖国。这就是加强国内团结的要道。我们的内部团结能够不断地加强，我们解放台湾和保卫和平的力量也就能够不断地加强。
    其次，解放台湾不是单纯的军事工作。我们必须从多方面来努力。在军事建设之外，政法、财经、文教各方面的建设工作都必须同样地集中力量来进行。工人为了解放台湾必须增加工业生产。农民为了解放台湾必须增加农业生产。学生青年为了解放台湾必须认真学习，认真锻炼身体。任何工作岗位的人为了解放台湾，都必需努力本位工作，厉行节约，提高爱国热诚，保证超额完成计划内的任务，促进国家社会主义工业化的速度。国家的实力不断地增长，我们解放台湾、保卫和平的力量也就不断地增长。
    再其次，为了解放台湾，我们必须加强与国际友人的联系。解放台湾就是保卫亚洲和平与世界和平，全世界爱好和平的人民是能够了解的。美国侵略集团的无止境的侵略行为，必须加以谴责，必须加以制止。全世界爱好和平的人民近几年来已经逐渐明白地看透了美国侵略集团的欺骗。所谓“防止共产主义侵略”、所谓“共同防御”，都不外是美国侵略集团实际进行侵略的幌子。我们应该更多地争取和平友人，孤立好战分子。特别对于爱好和平的美国人民，我们要更进一步伸出友谊的手。我们反抗美国侵略者，并不反对美国人民。美国侵略者同时是美国人民的敌人，美国人民是和我们站在一条战线上，而且应该是站在最前线的。假使美国人民能够坚决地制止美国好战分子的侵略行为，那么世界和平也就更容易地得到保障了。
    因此，我要向美国人民呼吁。美国人民是具有着打破殖民地枷锁的光荣历史的。美国人民，我们知道，一向是尊重着华盛顿、杰弗逊、林肯的传统的。但今天美国好战分子的行为，则是承继着希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机的衣钵，他们给亚洲和世界人民带来很大的危险，同时也给美国人民带来很大的危险。世界各国本来是可以和平共处的，美国好战分子为了贪图血腥的战争利润，一定要策划对立、进行侵略、扩军备战。这样，不仅增加世界的危机，而且使美国人民的安全直接遭受威胁。请问：美国的安全受到了中国的什么危害呢？是我们的中国人民解放军侵占了夏威夷？假使我们的人民解放军开到了你们的夏威夷，还不忙说像是靠近华盛顿的长岛，美国朋友们，你们会感觉怎样？你们会同意这是中国的“防御行为”吗？你们会安然无事地不闻不问吗？美国侵略集团今天侵占着我们的台湾，我们相信，爱好和平的美国人民也会认为是不正义的。为了美国自己利益和人民的光荣，也为了人类的幸福，美国人民有重大的责任，从速制止美国好战分子们的行动。
    我们中国人民向来是爱好和平的。在今天我们正集中力量要把自己的祖国建设成社会主义的国家，我们特别尊重和平。我们的政府和人民愿意在互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利的基础之上，与世界各国和平共处。我们决不侵略别人，但也决不能忍受别人的侵略。今天美国好战分子侵占着我们的台湾，指挥蒋介石卖国集团进行着种种罪恶的军事行动，我们的主权受着侵犯，我们的领土完整受着破坏，我们的内政受着干涉，这是我们所绝对不能容忍的。我们一定要解放台湾，一定要消灭蒋介石，这是我们的正义的神圣任务。凡是爱好和平、具有正义感的美国人民和全世界人民，我们相信，都能够了解。
    解放台湾，不用说也是爱国的台湾同胞们迫切的要求。爱国的台湾同胞们在旧日本帝国主义的殖民统治下斗争了几十年，在蒋介石的法西斯统治下也曾举行了“二·二八”的反抗斗争。今天陷在水深火热的灾难之中的台湾同胞们，盼望解放的迫切心情，我们是能够了解的。爱国的台湾同胞们，请你们再接再厉吧！大陆上的兄弟们并没有忘记你们。我们在炼铁炉旁边，我们在拖拉机旁边，我们在科尔沁草原上放牧，我们在珠穆朗玛峰下探勘，都没有忘记你们。我们每天清早一觉醒来的第一个念头，就是，一定要解放台湾！爱国的台湾同胞们，让我们共同努力，粉碎蒋介石卖国集团和美国侵略集团加在你们身上的双重锁链！
    我们中国人民不是好战的，我们中国人民是宽仁厚大的。即使是蒋介石的一小撮的卖国集团，我们也准备予以分别看待。凡是还有良心、还有羞恶之心的分子，凡是对于祖国还怀抱着爱念心情的分子，只要不愿死心蹋地作蒋介石的殉葬者，尽有机会立功赎罪。你们是重新做一个光荣的中国人，还是继续做一个卑鄙的美国奴才，是临到你们迅速抉择的时候了。
    正义是属于我们的，胜利也必然是属于我们的。
    全国的同胞们，更加坚强地团结起来，为完成解放台湾的神圣任务而奋斗！
