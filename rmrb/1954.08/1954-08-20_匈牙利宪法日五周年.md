    Hungarian Constitution Day Fifth Anniversary
    Jánosh Beer, Professor of Law, Budapest University
    I
    The Constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic was promulgated and came into effect on August 20, 1949. When the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, in its Decree No. 1 of 1950, designated this day as a national holiday, it stated that the most important reason was that the birth of this constitution
  "is a historically significant turning point in the lives of the Hungarian working people." This expresses the views of all Hungarian working people.
    Since the Hungarian people had never had a truly authentic constitution before this one, there is even more reason to celebrate its birth. The Constitution promulgated by Law No. 20 in 1949 is the first true constitution of the Hungarian people. It is precisely because of its socialist nature that it can broadly embody the progressive ideals of outstanding Hungarian patriots: the immortal ideals of Hungarian Social Democrats, reformers, and other heroic martyrs, the progressive goals of the struggle for Hungarian freedom and independence, and the brilliant initiatives contained in the constitution formulated by the Republic born from the Hungarian Socialist Revolution of 1919.
    Today, as we celebrate the fifth anniversary of Constitution Day, our task is to examine whether the Constitution has fulfilled its lofty mission, which is to record the fundamental transformations resulting from revolutionary developments and to correctly point out the path for the country's future development. We should look back and see whether the law passed by the Parliament on the proposal of the Hungarian Working People's Party has formulated a code that makes a significant contribution to improving the living standards of the Hungarian people and building socialism.
    Such an assessment is more appropriate as this fifth anniversary approaches. The recently concluded Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party summarized the achievements of the past decade since our country's liberation, made a summary of our country in this historical stage, and put forward the main tasks facing the Hungarian people.
    The resolutions adopted by the Congress affirmed the fact that in our country's thousand-year-old history, "our people have never experienced such profound economic, social, political, and cultural changes as in these ten years." In this short period, our country has transformed from a country of large financial groups, large-scale capitalism, exploiters, and the oppressed into a people's democratic country engaged in building socialism. The Congress's resolution stated: "In these ten years, Hungary has become a unified nation, a country that has built its independence on a solid foundation."
    The path of Hungary's socialist transformation basically follows the example of the socialist revolution. However, this revolution was not completed overnight but gradually. With the liberation of our country, the working class and the working peasants safeguarded their dictatorship; in this situation, thanks to the continuous friendly assistance from the Soviet Union after the liberation of our country, our country has transitioned to the dictatorship of the proletariat—the broadest and most profound form of democracy in constant struggle—in a relatively peaceful environment without any civil war. This development of revolutionary issues brought about a broad democratic regime based on the alliance of workers and peasants. Its leading force, the working class, closely cooperates with all other working classes: such as working peasants, intellectuals, and other working strata serving in state administration, economic, and cultural undertakings.
    Our Constitution plays a decisive role in this historical process because it contains the tremendous changes that can be achieved due to the emergence of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is a charter of the socialist order built on the unity of the people, the great development of socialist democracy, the new people's regime, the rights and obligations of citizens, and the socialist laws that encompass the entire national life.
    The adoption of our Constitution ended a short but politically, economically, and culturally important period, and it marked the beginning of a new era that had already laid a socialist foundation. It can be correctly said that our Constitution has successfully provided further guarantees for the political and legal conditions required for our country's development. Our Constitution has created political and legal conditions that are necessary for striving for the people's material and cultural upsurge, raising the people's political awareness, and forming a regime organ in which the masses directly and continuously participate in the management of economic and cultural affairs.
    The fifth anniversary of our Constitution is a suitable day to review the progress made by the regime and legislation in this stage and to analyze the role played by the Constitution.
    The following views are intended to make a small contribution in this regard.
    II
    First of all, it must be pointed out that our Constitution definitely ended the period in Hungarian legal history—ruled by the "thousand-year-old constitution" according to the old politicians—but in reality, it manifested as a thousand years of oppression and cruel exploitation of serfs and later Hungarian workers and peasants. This period was also temporarily interrupted by the Hungarian War of Independence, the glorious days of 1848-1849, and the great victory of the Hungarian working class in 1919.
    Generally, the progressive positive forces could hardly influence Hungary's feudal political system. A politician of the Horthy era unintentionally spoke the truth in a textbook published in 1926. He said: The laws of bourgeois Hungary "did not affect the ancient characteristics of Hungary's development, historical records, and the fundamental nature of the Hungarian constitution."
    The Constitution of the people's democratic regime, which formulated the establishment of the new Hungarian regime into legal form, had a fundamental impact on the development of our country's laws. The facts that have occurred before the fifth Constitution Day have clearly shown this point.
    When the National Assembly explained the reasons for the existence of each article of the draft Constitution and answered the suggestions put forward in the nationwide general discussion, Mátyás Rákosi quoted Stalin as saying that the Constitution should not become a "complete collection of laws," but must provide a legal basis for future legislative work.
    The history of legislation in the past five years proves that the Hungarian Constitution can also complete its task well in this regard. Since the Constitution came into effect, the Hungarian government agencies have been formulating laws, broadly expanding the rights of citizens, gradually completing the structure of socialist laws, and strengthening socialist legal concepts, all of which are due to the implementation of the articles stipulated in the Constitution.
    The following are some examples in legislation:
    Decree No. 1 of 1950 stipulated the establishment of local councils. Later, according to the provisions of the Constitution, the political organs of landlords and the bourgeoisie were thoroughly and resolutely eliminated, and at the same time, a good foundation was laid for the development of true people's rule. In the same year, the National Assembly promulgated Decree No. 2 formulating the principles of the new socialist criminal law and Bill No. 5 on defending peace.
    In 1951, a bill on new socialist criminal procedure was passed. In the same year, the National Assembly promulgated Law No. 7 to implement the labor law stipulated in the Constitution guaranteeing labor. The school system was expanded due to the adoption of Decree No. 15 stipulating the issue of universal education. In the same year, the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic passed Decree No. 26 establishing scientific degrees—a new measure for scientific work.
    In 1952, the National Assembly passed the new civil procedure (Decree No. 3) and the law on marriage, family, and guardians reflecting the high moral standards of socialist family relations (Decree No. 4). The basic scope of individual rights was stipulated (Decree No. 23), and at the same time, the state power management system was also placed on a new, socialist foundation (Decree No. 2).
    In 1953, the National Assembly expanded the democratic spirit of elections (Decree No. 2), and expanded the rights and guarantees of workers by amending and supplementing the labor law (Decree No. 25). According to the principles stipulated in the Constitution, the Procuratorate of the Hungarian People's Republic was established to safeguard socialist legal concepts.
    This year, in legislative activities, a law was formulated that formally encourages workers to make criticisms of state staff: the law on handling reports submitted by workers (Decree No. 1). The new court system has also been stipulated and will absorb the working people to participate in the judicial organs in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution (Decree No. 2).
    With the new establishment of the court, the laws concerning criminal and civil procedure have been expanded (Decrees No. 5 and No. 6). These two new laws not only provide further guarantees for law enforcement, but also expand the democracy of court proceedings.
    The above eloquent evidence of the progressive nature of the legal system of the Hungarian People's Republic also proves that the Constitution has firmly laid the foundation for, for example, the theory of maintaining social and economic order. Therefore, it is clear that the Constitution has laid a solid foundation for the continued development of legislation in all aspects, and it shows that in the socialist legal system, political rights are the basic part of the entire legislative system.
    In order to guarantee the principles and spirit of the Constitution, some amendments must be made due to rapid development. One amendment is to change the number and names of the various ministries due to economic and cultural progress. Another amendment is that the Council of Ministers includes the First Deputy Chairman and the Director of the State Planning Bureau. Another is that after the establishment of local conferences, they must cooperate closely with the judicial organs. All of the above laws constantly strengthen the role of the Constitution and improve the organization of the regime according to the principles stipulated in the Constitution.
    III
    The environment in which the Hungarian Constitution was born also reflects that our fundamental law originated from all the working people. In the relevant debates, the parliament received direct support from the suggestions made by the entire people to approve or supplement the draft Constitution. These suggestions were put forward in the discussions by the broad masses of residents before the parliamentary debates. Mátyás Rákosi correctly stated in the parliamentary debate on the draft Constitution that since the full text of the Constitution was published, "the Hungarian working people have proved in various ways that they are looking forward to the Constitution with joy and heartfelt approval, considering it a new source and strength." In the formulation of the Constitution, the working people actually realized that "it is the result of enormous effort and suffering" and is "faithful to the rights of the working people and the brilliant achievements of socialism."
    In the past five years, the close connection between the Constitution and our country's residents has become increasingly deep and intimate. All Hungarian patriotic people are increasingly feeling that the Hungarian Constitution belongs to them. At the same time, our Constitution is also a charter of Hungarian national unity.
    The resolution of the Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party emphatically pointed out that one of the most prominent and important achievements is that "completely different from the old Hungary, in today's Hungary, the people, the government, and the party are united. And this basic unity is becoming closer day by day." This is the provision in the Constitution that "the Hungarian People's Republic is the state of workers and working peasants. All power in the Hungarian People's Republic belongs to the working people" is gradually being presented in content and form.
    The considerations made at the Third Congress provided further guarantees for certain articles in the Constitution, according to which, in concrete practice, the Hungarian People's Republic relies on the organization of class-conscious workers, "relying on their strength in the democratic people's front. This organization embodies the close cooperation and democratic unity of industrial workers, agricultural workers, and intellectuals." The Congress quoted the above words when it announced the necessity of strengthening the strength of the people's front and establishing a broader and more practical people's independent front. When analyzing the tasks of the new people's front, Imre Nagy, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, pointed out: "The people's front is the social and political foundation on which the state and government are built. It is necessary to further strengthen its consolidation and long-term social foundation by establishing a new people's front and actively promoting its policies."
    Obviously, strengthening the policy of the people's front will help to further strengthen the significance of the Constitution. In the promotion of the activities of the people's front, the nature of the Constitution as a fundamental law will be greatly strengthened. At the same time, the new people's front will become an indestructible source of strength in the implementation of the constitutional provisions thereafter.
    Therefore, the fifth anniversary of the Hungarian Constitution has become a festival of a country with all the new achievements of the past and beautiful prospects for the future. Our Constitution is not only a legislative monument, it is a living force for continued development.
    When celebrating our Constitution, our working people are celebrating their own struggles and the results of construction labor, as well as their own future.

    匈牙利宪法日五周年
    布达佩斯大学法律学教授   雅诺什·贝尔
    一
    匈牙利人民共和国宪法于一九四九年八月二十日公布生效。匈牙利人民共和国主席团以一九五○年的第一号法令规定这一天为国家的节日的时候，曾经说明最重要的一个理由就是：这个宪法的诞生
  “是匈牙利劳动人民生活中具有历史意义的一个转折点。”这表达了全体匈牙利劳动人民的看法。
    由于匈牙利人民在这个宪法以前从未有过真正名符其实的宪法，因此也就更有理由来庆祝这个宪法的诞辰了。一九四九年以第二十号法令公布的宪法，是匈牙利人民的第一个真正的宪法。正是由于它的社会主义性质，才能够广泛地体现了卓越的匈牙利爱国者们的进步的理想：匈牙利社会民主党人、改革者和其他英雄烈士们的不朽理想，为争取匈牙利自由与独立而斗争的进步目标，以及包含在由于一九一九年匈牙利社会主义革命而产生的共和国所制定的宪法中的光辉创议。
    今天，当我们庆祝宪法日五周年的时候，我们的任务在于检查是否宪法已完成了它的崇高使命，这就是记载下由于革命发展的结果而产生的根本转变和正确地指出国家未来发展的道路。我们应该回顾一下，议会通过匈牙利劳动人民党所提出的这一法律，是否是制定了一项对于提高匈牙利人民生活水平和建设社会主义有重大贡献的法典。
    在这个五周年纪念日即将来临的时候，更宜于作这样的一个估价。最近才闭幕的匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会，曾经总结了我国解放后十年来的成就，做出了我国在这个历史阶段中的总结，并且提出了匈牙利人民所面临的主要任务。
    代表大会所采取的决议肯定了这一事实：在我国的千年古老历史中，“我们人民从来不曾经历过像这十年中这样深刻的经济、社会、政治和文化的变革”。在这个短时期内，我国已从一个大财团、大资本主义、剥削者和被压迫者的国家转变成一个从事建设社会主义的人民民主国家了。代表大会的决议说：“在这十年中，匈牙利已成为一个统一的民族、一个把独立建筑在强固基础上的国家了”。
    匈牙利社会主义转变的道路，基本是仿效社会主义革命的榜样。然而这个革命不是在一夜工夫，而是逐步完成的。随着我国的解放，工人阶级和劳动农民维护了他们的专政；在这样的情况下，由于苏联在解放我国后又不断给予我国以友好援助，我国已在比较和平的环境中转入了无产阶级专政——在经常斗争中的最广泛与最深刻的民主形式——而没有发生任何内战。革命问题的这种发展，带来了一个建立在工农联盟基础上的广泛民主政权。它的领导力量工人阶级，与所有的其他劳动阶级：如劳动农民、知识分子和其他在国家行政、经济与文化事业中服务的其他劳动阶层紧密地合作着。
    我国宪法在这一历史进程中起着决定性的作用，因为它包含着由于无产阶级专政的产生而能够取得的巨大变革。它是以人民的团结、社会主义民主的巨大发展、人民的新政权、公民的权利与义务以及概括整个国家生活的社会主义法律而建立起来的社会主义秩序的宪章。
    我国宪法的通过，结束了一个短促但在政治、经济和文化上却十分重要的时期，它并且标志着一个已经打下了社会主义基础的新的时代的开始。可以这样正确地说：我国宪法已成功地为我国的发展所需要的政治和法律的条件提供了进一步的保证。我国宪法产生了政治和法律的条件，这些条件是争取人民物质与文化的高涨、提高人民的政治觉悟和组成由群众直接和不断参加管理经济与文化事务的政权机关所必要的。
    我国宪法的五周年纪念日，是适宜于回顾在这个阶段中，政权与立法所促成的进展，和分析宪法所起的作用的日子。
    下面所提出的看法，就是想要在这方面做出一点贡献。
    二
    首先必须指出：我国宪法肯定地结束了匈牙利法律史上——按照旧时政治家的说法——被“千年的古老宪法”所统治，但在实际上却表现为千年的压迫和对农奴以及后来的匈牙利工人和农民残酷剥削的时期。这个时期也曾在匈牙利的独立战争，一八四八——一八四九年的光荣日子和匈牙利工人阶级一九一九年的伟大胜利时期而暂时中断过。
    一般进步的积极力量很难以影响到匈牙利的封建政治制度。霍尔第时代的一个政治家，曾无意中在一九二六年出版的一本教科书中说出了真理。他说：资产阶级匈牙利的法律“没有影响匈牙利的发展、历史记录和匈牙利宪法根本性质的古老特质。”
    把新的匈牙利政权的建立制定成法规形式的人民民主政权的宪法，对于我国法律的发展起了根本的影响。在第五个宪法日以前所发生的种种事实，已很清楚地表明了这一点。
    当国民议会逐条解释宪法草案条文的存在的理由和回答在全国普遍讨论中所提出的建议的时候，马加斯·拉科西曾引证斯大林的话说，宪法不能变成一部“法律大全”，宪法必须给予将来立法工作以法定的基础。
    过去五年中立法方面的历史证明，匈牙利宪法也能在这方面很好地完成它的任务。自从宪法生效以来，匈牙利政府机关已在制定法律，广泛地扩充了公民的权利，逐步完成了社会主义法律的结构，并加强了社会主义法律观念，这一切都是由于宪法中所规定的条文的实施而来的。
    下面引证在立法中的一些例子：
    一九五○年的第一号法令规定了地方会议的设立。以后，根据宪法的规定，地主和资产阶级的政权机构即被彻底坚决地扫除了，同时也就为真正的人民统治的开展打下了一个良好的基础。同年，国民议会公布了制定新的社会主义刑法原则的第二号法令和第五号保卫和平法案。
    一九五一年通过了新的社会主义刑事诉讼程序的法案。同年，国民议会以第七号法令公布了实现宪法中规定保障劳动的劳动法。由于通过了规定关于普及教育问题的第十五号法令，学校系统得以扩充。同年，匈牙利人民共和国主席团通过了建立科学学位——一种对于科学工作的新措施——的第二十六号法令。
    国民议会在一九五二年通过了新的民事诉讼程序（第三号法令）和反映社会主义家庭关系高度道德标准的婚姻、家庭与监护人法（第四号法令）。规定了个人权利的基本范围（第二十三号法令），同时，国家政权管理制度也被置于一个新的、社会主义基础之上（第二号法令）。
    一九五三年，国民议会扩充了选举的民主精神（第二号法令），并且由于修正和补充了劳动法，因而扩大了工人的权利和保证（第二十五号法令）。根据宪法规定的原则，创立了匈牙利人民共和国的检察署，以保障社会主义法律观念。
    今年，在立法活动中制定了正式鼓励工人对国家工作人员提出批评的精神的法律：处理工人提出的报告的法律（第一号法令）。新的法院制度也已规定，并将按照宪法中的规定吸收劳动人民参加司法机关（第二号法令）。
    随着法院的新编制，有关刑事以及民事诉讼程序的法律已被扩充（第五和第六号法令）。这两项新的法律不但为执法提供了进一步的保证，而且还扩充了法院诉讼程序上的民主性。
    以上所述匈牙利人民共和国法制进步性的雄辩证据，还证明了宪法已稳固地奠定了例如维护社会和经济秩序的理论的基础。因此，显然宪法已为各方面立法的继续发展打下了巩固的根基，并且说明：在社会主义的法制中，政治权利实为全部立法制度的基本部分。
    为了保障宪法中的原则和精神，由于迅速发展的结果，必须作出一些修正。一个修正就是由于经济和文化的进展而改变各个部的数目和名称。另一个修正是部长会议包括第一副主席和国家计划局局长。还有一个是地方会议建立后，它们必须与司法机关紧密合作。所有以上的法律，不断地加强了宪法的作用，并根据着宪法中所规定的原则，改进了政权组织。
    三
    匈牙利宪法诞生的环境，还反映出，我国的根本法是产生自全体劳动人民的。在有关的辩论中，议会得到全体人民所提出的赞成或补充宪法草案的建议的直接支持。这些建议是在议会辩论前，由广大居民的讨论中所提出的。马加斯·拉科西在宪法草案的议会辩论中正确地说道，自从宪法全文公布以来，“匈牙利劳动人民以各种方式证明了，他们是以愉快的心情和衷心的赞成期待着宪法，认为它是一个新的源泉和力量”。在宪法制定中，劳动人民实际体会到了“它是巨大的努力和痛苦的结果”，是“忠实于劳动人民的权利与社会主义的辉煌成就”。
      在过去的五年中，宪法与我国居民间的紧密联系，愈益变得深刻而亲切了。一切匈牙利的爱国人民都日益感觉到：匈牙利宪法是属于他们的。同时，我国宪法也是匈牙利民族团结的宪章。
    匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会的决议着重地指出了，最突出和最重要的成就之一是“和旧日的匈牙利完全不同，在今日的匈牙利，人民、政府和党是团结一致的。而这个基本的团结一致一天比一天更加密切”。这就是宪法中的规定“匈牙利人民共和国是工人和劳动农民的国家。匈牙利人民共和国全部政权属于劳动人民”，正逐渐呈现于内容和形式上。
    第三次代表大会上所作出的考虑，为宪法中的某些条文提供了进一步的保证，按照这些条文，在具体实践中，匈牙利人民共和国依靠于阶级觉悟工人的组织，“在民主的人民阵线中依靠着他们的力量。这个组织体现着产业工人、农业工人和知识分子的紧密合作与民主团结。”代表大会当宣布加强人民阵线力量的必要性并且建立一个更广泛的更实际的人民独立阵线的时候，引用了上面的话。在分析新的人民阵线的任务时，匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席伊姆雷·纳吉曾指出：“人民阵线是国家与政府所赖以建立的社会与政治的基础。必须用建立新的人民阵线和积极推行其政策的办法，进一步加强其巩固与长久的社会基础。”
    显然，加强人民阵线的政策，将有助于进一步加强宪法的意义。在推广人民阵线的活动中，作为一个根本法的宪法的性质，将更为大大加强。同时，新的人民阵线将更变成为在此后宪法条文执行中的一个不可摧毁的力量源泉。
    因此，匈牙利宪法的第五周年纪念日，成为一个有着过去一切新的成就和将来美丽远景的国家的节日。我们的宪法不仅是立法上的一个纪念物，它是继续发展的一个有生力量。
    在庆祝我国宪法的时候，我们的劳动人民是庆祝他们自己的斗争和建设劳动的成果以及他们自己的未来。
