Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 27th: The entire body of deputies of the First Session of the First Anhui Provincial People's Congress sent a telegram to the CCP Central Committee, the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, and the provinces, cities, and people of the entire country, expressing gratitude for the affectionate concern and powerful support given to the people of Anhui Province in their struggle against the floods. The text of the telegram is as follows:

    This year, in the struggle against the floods, the people of our province received the correct leadership and affectionate concern of the CCP Central Committee and the Central People's Government, and the enthusiastic support and assistance of the provinces, cities, and people of the entire country. This gave us direction and strength, increased our courage and confidence, and enabled us to achieve a significant victory in the two-month-plus flood control struggle, laying the foundation for ultimately overcoming the floods and for the timely restoration of production in the disaster-stricken areas. For this, we, on behalf of the people of Anhui Province, extend our heartfelt gratitude to you. Currently, the people in the disaster-stricken areas of our province are seizing the time to drain water and replant crops, engaging in production for self-salvation. The people in the non-disaster areas are actively expanding cultivated land area, rushing to plant late autumn crops, and strengthening field management of existing crops, striving to over fulfill the task of increasing grain production in order to support our compatriots in the disaster areas and support national economic construction. We believe that under the correct leadership of the CCP Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, under the direct guidance of the CCP Central Committee's East China Bureau and the East China Administrative Council, and with the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people in fraternal regions across the country, we will certainly be able to overcome the difficulties caused by natural disasters and victoriously overcome the famine.
