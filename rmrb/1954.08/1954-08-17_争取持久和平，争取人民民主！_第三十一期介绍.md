The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Chinese edition of 1954, Issue No. 31, has been published.

This issue reports on the implementation of the national economic plans of the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries in the first half of 1954, and publishes an editorial entitled "For Peace and the Happiness of the People." The editorial points out: The Communist and Workers' Parties of the countries of the socialist camp are the leading and guiding forces of the country. Their policies and all their work proceed from the vital interests of the masses of the people. The communiqués on the results of the implementation of the national economic plans in the first half of this year, published by these countries, vividly demonstrate the infinite creativity of the people who have become masters of their own destiny, and prove that the purpose of continuously developing socialist production is to continuously improve the welfare of the people. To work for the welfare and happiness of the people, for peace and progress, is the aspiration of the working people of all countries in the socialist camp today. The unwavering foreign policy of these countries is permeated with the lofty ideas of peace and friendship among all peoples. Broad international opinion is greatly interested in and highly approves of the recent note of the Soviet government to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on the issue of European collective security. The vast majority of people around the world demand the maintenance and consolidation of peace. For them, the outstanding new achievements of the peace policy of the democratic and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are a great example to inspire them to move forward.

This issue contains the statement of the Soviet government on the Geneva Conference and the message of President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on behalf of the government, to the compatriots, all military personnel, and cadres throughout the country.

This issue also contains articles such as "The Question of Ensuring All-European Collective Security" by V. Kopecki, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, "A Major Victory for the Forces of Peace" by Maurice Kriegel-Valrimont, member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, "The Budget of the People's Republic of China—A Budget for Peaceful Construction" by Deng Xiaoping, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and "The Italian Communists Fight to Change Italy's Policies" by Giorgio Amendola, member of the Central Steering Committee of the Italian Communist Party.

Kopecki's article points out: For all European countries, regardless of size or social system, the most urgent issue at present is to further ease international tensions, consolidate peace, and ensure the security of all peoples. The recent note of the Soviet government to France, Britain, and the United States on the issue of European collective security raises the fundamental issues of the current international situation and has aroused a very wide response internationally. All peace-loving people attach great importance to maintaining and consolidating peace in Europe and the world, and to developing international cooperation. The draft treaty on European collective security proposed by the Soviet government proceeds from and conforms to these requirements.

Amendola's article is an excerpt from his recent report to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party. He points out: The political situation in Italy is unstable. There is widespread dissatisfaction throughout the country, and the broad masses of the people demand a change in the current government's policies. The author then analyzes the situation in which Italy's economic stagnation, the increasing impoverishment of the working people, and the rapid development of monopoly enterprises have aroused dissatisfaction among people of all strata. He said: The political manifestations of these changes are the continuous growth of left-wing forces, the crisis of the ruling party bloc, and the political paralysis and internal division of the right-wing royalist fascist parties. When discussing the demands of the Italian people's current struggle, the author points out: At the very least, state-controlled factories and mines must be reorganized, measures to restrict monopoly capital must be formulated, land reform must be carried out, farming contracts must be changed, the unemployed population must be reduced, and efforts must be made to get rid of the humiliating position that Italy is currently in internationally due to its current policies, and to strive for peace and national independence, and to oppose the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty. The author calls for expanding democratic unity, for uniting the working class, left-wing parties, and all other forces that are dissatisfied with the current government's policies, and for carrying out a powerful mass struggle to change Italy's policies.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”第三十一期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第三十一期中文版已经出版。
    本期报道了苏联和东欧人民民主国家一九五四年上半年国民经济计划执行情况，并以“为了和平和人民的幸福”为题发表社论。社论指出：社会主义阵营各国的共产党和工人党是国家的领导和指导力量。它们的政策和全部工作都是从人民群众的切身利益出发的。这些国家所发表的今年上半年的国民经济计划执行结果的公报，生动地证明成了自己命运的主人的人民具有无穷无尽的创造力，证明不断发展社会主义生产的目的是为了不断提高人民的福利。为人民的福利和幸福、为和平与进步而劳动，这就是今天社会主义阵营各国劳动人民的愿望。这些国家的坚定不移的外交政策贯串着各国人民和平与友好的崇高思想。广大的国际舆论界人士对苏联政府最近就欧洲集体安全问题致法、英、美三国政府的照会，感到极大的兴趣并表示十分赞同。全世界绝大多数人要求维护并巩固和平。对他们来说，以苏联为首的民主和社会主义阵营各国的和平政策的卓越新成就，就是鼓舞他们前进的伟大榜样。
    本期刊载了苏联政府关于日内瓦会议的声明和越南民主共和国主席胡志明代表政府向全国同胞、全体军队人员和干部发表的文告。
    本期还刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治局委员瓦·柯别茨基的“保障全欧集体安全的问题”、法国共产党中央委员莫·克里埃歇—瓦尔里蒙的“和平力量的重大胜利”、中共中央委员邓小平的“中华人民共和国的预算——和平建设的预算”和意大利共产党中央指导处成员乔治·阿门多拉的“意大利共产党人为改变意大利施政方针而斗争”等文章。
    柯别茨基的文章指出：对于所有欧洲国家来说，不论大小，不论社会制度如何，当前最迫切的问题就是进一步缓和国际紧张局势、巩固和平和保障各国人民的安全。苏联政府最近就欧洲集体安全问题致法、英、美三国的照会，提出了当前国际局势的根本问题，在国际上引起了极广泛的响应。所有爱好和平的人们都极为重视维护并巩固欧洲和世界和平，重视发展国际合作。苏联政府提出欧洲集体安全条约草案，正是从这些要求出发而且符合这些要求的。
    阿门多拉的文章是他最近在意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议上的报告的摘要。他指出：意大利的政治形势是不稳定的。全国普遍存在不满情绪，广大人民都要求改变现政府施政方针。接着作者分析了意大利经济停滞、劳动人民日益贫困而垄断企业得到迅速发展激起各阶层人民不满的情况。他说：这些变化在政治上的表现就是左翼力量的不断增长，执政党集团的危机以及右翼保皇法西斯党派的政治瘫痪和内部分裂。作者在谈到意大利人民当前斗争的要求时指出：至少得整顿国家所控制的厂矿、制订限制垄断资本的措施、进行土地改革、改变耕种契约、减少失业人口，并且要争取摆脱目前意大利因现行政策而在国际上所处的屈辱地位，争取和平和民族独立，反对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约。作者号召扩大民主团结，号召团结工人阶级、左翼政党及其他不满现政府政策的一切力量，进行强大的群众斗争，使意大利的施政方针得以改变。
