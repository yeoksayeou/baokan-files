Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: Under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the unemployment phenomenon in Taiwan is severe, making it extremely difficult for graduates of universities, colleges, and senior vocational schools to find employment. The pseudo-Taiwan Provincial Government held an employment examination for graduates of universities, colleges, and senior vocational schools in July this year. This examination imposed various strict restrictions. Only students who graduated from colleges and above last year, students who graduated from senior vocational schools this year, and students who graduated in 1952 who had not participated in the employment examination were allowed to participate. Those who passed the examination, regardless of their original field of study, would, with the exception of a portion recruited by the Chiang bandit military organs and so-called "central organs," be "provisionally assigned and appointed or interned separately" by the pseudo-provincial government according to a 5% proportion of the personnel quotas of provincial, county, and municipal agencies and township/district public offices. Even if the assigned work was unrelated to their studies, students were not allowed to request a change of job. According to Taiwan newspapers, a total of more than 5,900 students participated in this year's employment examination, but only 40% were admitted. But in fact, the admitted students still find it difficult to get a job. Taiwan newspapers admit that some of the heads of the agencies designated to accept the admitted students refuse to accept them on the grounds of lack of funds and inability to pay salaries. Some agencies are already laying off large numbers of employees, giving them even more reason to refuse to accept these students. However, on the other hand, various agencies continue to employ people with personal connections.

    在蒋介石卖国集团统治下
    台湾高等学校毕业生谋生难
    【新华社二十八日讯】蒋介石卖国集团统治下的台湾失业现象严重，以致大学、专科学校和高级职业学校毕业学生谋生极为困难。伪台湾省政府在今年七月举行了一次大学、专科学校和高级职业学校毕业学生的就业考试。这次考试作了种种严格的限制。参加考试的只限于去年专科以上学校毕业的学生和今年的高级职业学校毕业的学生，以及一九五二年毕业的未参加过就业考试的学生。考试及格者，不管学生原来所学的是什么，除一部分由蒋匪军事机关以及所谓“中央机关”录用外，其余由伪省政府按省、县、市所属机关及各乡镇市区公所员额百分之五的比例，“暂行分发，分别任用或实习”。即使分配的工作用非所学，学生也不得请求改换工作。据台湾报纸透露，参加今年这次就业考试的学生共五千九百多名，被录取的只占百分之四十。但是事实上，被录取的学生仍然很难得到工作。台湾报纸承认，有的被预定为收容录取学生的机关的负责人，多以缺乏经费、无法支付薪金为理由，拒绝接受。有的机关本身正在大量裁员，更有理由拒绝接受这些学生。但是，另一方面，各机关对于有人事关系的人还是不断地用进。
