Notice to Southern Provinces on Strengthening Camellia Tree Cultivation and Management

The Central People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Forestry issued a notice to southern provinces to strengthen the cultivation and management of camellia trees.

The notice stated: The camellia trees in our southern provinces produce tea seeds that can be pressed for oil, which has high economic value for both edible and industrial purposes. Furthermore, they are mostly planted in hilly mountain areas, which do not compete with grain, cotton, and other crops for land. After years of efforts to restore production, camellia yields have increased, but there are still many abandoned camellia mountains that have not been developed, resulting in very low yields. Therefore, actively leading camellia production and organizing farmers to strengthen the management and reclamation of camellia mountains are critical keys to increasing oil production at present.

The notice pointed out: After summer weeding and winter mountain digging, camellia production can generally increase by 20% to 50% or more. This is currently the most effective method for increasing production, and all camellia-producing areas should promote this work in a planned manner.

The notice requires that leading organs in major producing areas should make plans, rely on mutual aid and cooperation, strengthen labor organization, vigorously carry out the management and reclamation of camellia mountains, and publicize the great significance of increasing camellia production for supporting national industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture. They should also formulate reasonable purchase prices to dispel farmers' concerns about long-term management, while also paying attention to issuing some loans and ensuring planned grain supply to increase the production enthusiasm of the masses. Forest farms or agricultural farms in major producing areas should cultivate some camellia seedlings to meet the needs of future expansion.

    通知南方各省加强油茶树栽培管理工作
    中央人民政府农业部、林业部通知南方各省加强油茶树的栽培管理工作。
    通知说：我国南方各省的油茶树，所产茶籽可以榨油，在食用上和工业上都有很高的经济价值，并且多在邱陵山地栽植，不与粮棉等农作物争地。几年来经过努力恢复，油茶产量已有增加，但仍有不少荒芜油茶山未经整理，收获量很低。因此积极领导油茶生产，组织农民加强油茶山的管理与垦复工作，是当前增产油料的重要关键之一。
    通知指出：油茶经过夏季锄草及冬季挖山，一般可以增产百分之二十到五十以上，这是目前增产效果最显著的方法，各油茶产区应有计划地推动这一工作。
    通知要求各主要产区领导机关要做好计划，依靠互助合作，加强劳动组织，大力进行油茶山的管理和垦复工作，并宣传增产油茶对支援国家工业化与农业社会主义改造的重大意义，制定合理收购价格，打消农民不愿长期经营的顾虑，同时注意发放一部分贷款，并做好粮食计划供应，提高群众的生产积极性。各主要产区的林场或农场，应培育一部分油茶苗木，以供今后扩大推广的需要。
