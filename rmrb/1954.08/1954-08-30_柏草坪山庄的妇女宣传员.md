Yang Weiting, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of Baicaoping Township in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, thought after listening to the explanation of the draft Constitution: The draft Constitution is related to the interests of all Chinese people. Baicaoping Township covers an area of forty miles and has forty-eight mountain villages. How can we let all the people in the township, especially the women, know the basic content of the draft Constitution and its direct relationship to them? One day in mid-July, Yang Weiting gathered four female Youth League members and twelve women activists to discuss this matter. League member Lü Sannü said: "I heard that Article 96 of the draft Constitution stipulates that women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life. Marriage, family, mothers, and children are protected by the state. This is a great joy for us women, and we must let the women in our mountain village know! Once they know, they will work hard to produce and support national construction." Then Guo Linfeng said: "In my opinion, we should combine those with culture and those without, those with high cultural levels and those with low, those who can speak well and those who can't, and divide them into six women's propaganda groups. We'll go to the mountain villages to do propaganda every five days, carrying baskets (dung baskets) to pick up manure on the road, so as to ensure that propaganda and production are not delayed." Middle-aged woman Jin Yongjing said: "I'll take my shoe soles with me, and after arriving at the mountain village, I'll gather the women in the shade of the trees, sewing shoe soles while doing propaganda on the draft Constitution." They discussed the propaganda plan in their own ways.

The next day, each group, carrying dry food and newspapers, some carrying baskets, some holding shoe soles, actively went to the mountain villages to promote the draft Constitution. Yang Weiting led three women all the way to Pangeng, more than ten miles away. Coincidentally, there were more than a dozen women sewing shoe soles under the shade of the trees. Yang Weiting first talked with them about their families and asked: Have you heard about the draft Constitution? Jin Yun'e said: "I've heard about it, but I don't know the details." Yang Weiting explained the basic content of the draft Constitution in detail, especially explaining how the state cares about women's rights and interests, and how women should continue to work hard to contribute to the country. After hearing this, Jin Yun'e recalled the pain of being a child bride at the age of seven or eight. When she mentioned that the draft Constitution stipulates that women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects, she said: "For the sake of the country and for ourselves, in addition to actively promoting the draft Constitution, I will also participate in field production well." More and more people listened, and this time twenty-six women heard the propaganda of the draft Constitution. Yang Weiting's group continuously promoted three mountain villages in this way in one day, and also selected twelve women activists to strengthen the propaganda force, so that the propaganda of the draft Constitution quickly spread to more mountain villages. The propaganda group led by Lü Sannü, after promoting in the mountain village of Suanluotou, the woman Meng Ernu expressed her willingness to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and on the same day led three women to go to the fields to catch insects, and also set a plan to accumulate a load of fertilizer every day.

This time, the sixteen women in the propaganda group carried out propaganda to more than one hundred women in forty-eight mountain villages, and also picked up fourteen loads of manure and sewed one pair of shoe soles.

    柏草坪山庄的妇女宣传员
    刘人杰　张炳皋　何宪文　穆起志
    河北省武安县柏草坪乡青年团支部书记杨未廷，听了宪法草案的解释后，她想：宪法草案关系着全中国人民的利益。柏草坪乡方圆四十里，有四十八个山庄，如何叫全乡人民特别是妇女们都知道宪法草案的基本内容以及和自己的切身关系呢。七月中旬的一天，杨未廷召集了四个女青年团员、十二个妇女积极分子商量这件事，团员吕三女说：“我听说宪法草案第九十六条规定着妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利。婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童受国家的保护。这可是咱妇女的大喜事，说啥也得叫咱山庄的妇女们知道哩！她们知道了，一定要努力生产，支持国家建设。”接着国林凤说：“我的意见，咱把有文化的和没有文化的，文化高的和文化低的，能说的和不能说的结合起来，分成六个妇女宣传小组，五天上山庄去宣传一次，咱担上箩头
  （粪筐），来回在道上拾粪，要作到宣传、生产两不误。”中年妇女靳用景说：“俺要拿上鞋底子，到山庄后把妇女集中到树荫里，一面衲鞋底子，一面宣传宪法草案。”她们你一言，我一语的，订出了宣传计划。
    第二天，各组带着干粮、报纸，有的担着箩头，有的拿着鞋底子，积极地上山庄去宣传宪法草案了。杨未廷带领三个妇女，一直到十几里地远的盘根去，凑巧有十几个妇女在树荫下衲鞋底子，杨未廷先和她们谈起了家常，问到：你们听说宪法草案了没有？靳云娥说：“听说了，可是俺不知道根根底底是怎么回事。”杨未廷就详细讲解了宪法草案的基本内容，特别说明了国家如何关怀妇女的权益，和妇女应该怎样继续努力，为国家贡献自己的力量。靳云娥听这么一说，回忆了自己在七、八岁时当童养媳的痛苦，提到宪法草案规定着妇女在各方面享有与男子同等的权利时，她说：“为了国家和为了我们自己，我除了积极宣传宪法草案外，还要好好地参加田间生产。”听的人越来越多了，这一次就有二十六个妇女听到了宪法草案的宣传。杨未廷小组就这样一天连续宣传了三个山庄，并且又选了十二个妇女积极分子，充实了宣传力量，使宪法草案的宣传，很快就扩展到更多的山庄。吕三女带领的宣传小组，在山庄酸萝头宣传后，妇女孟二女表示要参加互助合作组织，当天就带动了三个妇女，下地捉虫，并订出了每天积一担肥的计划。
    这次宣传组的十六个妇女，向四十八个山庄的一百多个妇女进行了宣传，还拾粪十四担，衲鞋底子一双。
