Xinjiang Province organizes cotton production inspection team to conduct inspections in cotton-producing areas.

    In order to further develop cotton production and support national industrial construction, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government has organized a cotton production inspection team to conduct inspections in various regions. The inspection team includes representatives from the Xinjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Cooperative Bureau, the Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company, and the Trade Company. Representatives from the Central Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Northwest Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, the Water Conservancy Bureau, the Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company, and the Northwest Supply and Marketing Department of China Textile Corporation have also been sent to participate. The inspection team is divided into two groups based on work requirements: cotton production planning and cotton purchase and transportation. It departed from Urumqi on June 25th and traveled to cotton-producing areas such as Yanqi, Kuche, Kuerle, Aksu, Bachu, Makit, and Shache for inspection. In early September, it will move to the Manas River basin and Turpan in northern Xinjiang for inspection.

    Xinjiang's natural environment is characterized by low rainfall and abundant sunshine, and farmland mainly relies on irrigation, making it highly suitable for cotton cultivation. The cultivated land area only accounts for one percent of the arable land area, and there is a large amount of wasteland that can be reclaimed, and there are also conditions for developing water conservancy. Furthermore, the existing cotton field area only accounts for four percent of the current cultivated land, which can generally be expanded to more than twenty percent. At the same time, due to crude cotton planting techniques, the average yield per unit area is very low. The 20,000 mu of cotton planted by the People's Liberation Army's production troops stationed in Xinjiang have achieved an average yield of 402 jin of seed cotton per mu due to the adoption of advanced Soviet cotton planting experience, and the high-yield fields have produced more than 1,300 jin per mu, indicating great potential for cotton production.

    新疆省组织棉产考察组赴棉区进行考察
    新疆省人民政府为了进一步发展棉花生产，支援国家工业建设，特组织棉产考察组，前往各地考察。参加考察组的有新疆省农林厅、合作局、花纱布公司、贸易公司等单位。中央农业部、纺织工业部、西北农林局、水利局、花纱布公司、中纺西北供销处也派人参加。考察组根据工作要求分为棉花生产计划和棉花收购、运输等两小组。已于六月二十五日由乌鲁木齐市出发，前往焉耆、库车、库尔勒、阿克苏、巴楚、麦盖提莎车等棉区考察，九月初将转入北疆玛纳斯河流域与吐鲁番等地考察。
    新疆的自然环境是降雨少、日照多，农田主要依靠灌溉，最适宜种植棉花；已耕地面积只占可耕地面积的百分之一，可以开垦的荒地很多，开发水利也有条件。再则现有棉田面积只占现耕地的百分之四，一般还可扩大到百分之二十以上。同时现在由于植棉技术粗糙，一般单位面积产量很低。人民解放军驻新疆生产部队所种的二万亩棉花，由于采用了苏联的先进植棉经验，每亩平均产籽棉四百零二斤，丰产田每亩产一千三百多斤，棉花生产潜力很大。
