    Gradual Employment of Hui People in Beijing
    Ma Yuhuai (Hui Nationality), Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau

    Beijing has approximately 80,000 Hui people. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Hui people not only suffered political discrimination, oppression, and humiliation, but also faced great difficulties in production and employment. Therefore, the vast majority of Hui people were engaged in industries such as noodle making, restaurants, beef and mutton, mule and horse trading, antiques, and petty trading. Production was insecure, and the general Hui masses struggled in a life of hardship. After liberation, the era of national oppression ended permanently, and the Hui people were emancipated, gaining equal rights with the Han people. However, with the restoration and development of the social economy, certain backward industries engaged in by the Hui people inevitably began to decline or be eliminated. Consequently, there was a temporary increase in the number of unemployed Hui people for a period after liberation. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Beijing Municipal People's Government attached great importance to this issue and immediately decided to gradually and systematically help the Hui people to change careers and find employment, paying attention to absorbing Hui people into factories and enterprises.

    At that time (summer of 1951), the national estrangement and discrimination left over from history still existed to a considerable extent. On the Han side, it was believed that the Hui people were "difficult to manage," "prone to fighting," or feared "trouble." Therefore, some factories, mines, and enterprise departments were unwilling or even openly refused to recruit Hui people to work; on the Hui side, there were great concerns, fearing "mistreatment" and that their "living habits would not be respected." In addition, the Hui people, having long lived a scattered small-business economic life, looked down on productive labor, harbored the capitalist speculative idea that "a good man doesn't earn fixed money," and lacked the habit of collective life, and were unwilling to participate in work. Thus, the issue of Hui people changing careers and finding employment encountered serious obstacles. In order to eliminate these ideological obstacles, the Beijing Party and government leaders, on the one hand, continuously carried out propaganda and education work on national policies for all cadres and the people, criticizing Han chauvinism; on the other hand, they decided to run political training classes to educate the Hui people.

    The Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau held amateur political training classes for ethnic minorities (mainly Hui people), conducting education on national unity, the glory of labor, and patriotism and internationalism.

    In the past three years, Beijing has held nine training classes in total (including training classes for beef and mutton industry transferees), training 6,244 people (Hui people accounting for over 90%). Among them, more than 3,480 people have been formally employed in government agencies, factories, mines, and enterprises through introductions. If we add those directly absorbed by various parties, there are now more than 8,000 people (excluding Hui people in central, North China-level agencies, and troops stationed in Beijing) participating in work. Our method of introducing work is: first, to establish close ties with labor departments and larger factories and enterprises, ensuring that the people we introduce meet the conditions (those with insufficient education receive remedial education in advance); then, to introduce them in batches, and to give priority to introducing trainees with a clear history, correct ideological understanding, and who are relatively active and excellent. This has dispelled the concerns of employers about recruiting Hui people and can avoid some practical difficulties for employers, and the Hui people are also at ease. Many trainees who have been introduced to employment have become models in work or production. According to a recent survey of 21 production units, a total of 83 people have been commended for outstanding work performance. At the same time, we also coordinate with relevant government departments to regularly understand the living conditions of employed Hui people, help them solve the difficulties they encounter, and conduct necessary education to consolidate and continuously improve their work enthusiasm.

    With the widespread employment of Hui people, another issue has been raised - the issue of Hui people's meals. It is not only related to the Hui people's personal and special interests, but also to the Hui people's work mood and production issues. Based on the joint instructions of the North China Administrative Committee's Nationalities Affairs Committee and the Finance Bureau, we have stipulated the following methods: Hui staff can set up independent messes; those with too few people can be given appropriate subsidies according to the method of subsidizing small mess units; for those who have not established mess units but must purchase food outside, a certain amount of food allowance is subsidized per person per month. Factories, mines, and enterprise departments also refer to the above methods to give Hui people appropriate care. According to a general survey in August 1953, this issue has been basically resolved.

    Now the Hui people of Beijing have changed their old appearance. The "narrow path for Hui people" (meaning the scope of livelihood is very narrow) that has always been circulating among the Hui people no longer exists. In Beijing's agencies, factories, schools, enterprises, cooperatives, banks... everywhere you can see newly employed young Hui men and women working and producing. With the improvement of life, cultural education has also developed greatly. In 1949, there were only more than 600 Hui middle school students and only more than 2,700 primary school students; now there are more than 2,740 middle school students and more than 9,830 primary school students (accounting for 97% of school-age children), and there are also more than 360 students with college degrees or above. Various cultural and recreational sports activities are also being carried out more and more widely. The cultural and educational undertakings of the Hui people have been able to develop in this way because they are inseparable from their progressive and stable economic foundation.

    National unity has also been strengthened as never before. After the liberation of Beijing, due to the influence left by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, there were as many as 48 major ethnic disputes among the Hui and Han people in the ten months of 1949, and there were also 28 in 1950. Since June 1951, none have occurred. This is not to say that things that once caused ethnic disputes like in 1949 do not happen, but rather that after such things happen, the people, especially the Hui people, can solve them on their own in the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, criticism, and self-criticism.

    Profound changes have also taken place within the Hui people, that is, there is already a fairly strong advanced working class among the Hui people.

    "If it weren't for the Communist Party, if it weren't for the People's Government, if it weren't for Chairman Mao, the Hui people wouldn't have what they have today," this is a very common saying among the Hui people.

### 北京市回民逐步就业

    北京市回民逐步就业
    北京市人民政府民政局局长  马玉槐（回族）
    北京市约有回民八万人。国民党反动统治时期，回民不但在政治上受到歧视、压迫和侮辱，在生产就业方面也有很大困难，所以绝大多数回民从事面食、饭馆、牛羊肉、骡马贩、古玩、小商贩等行业，生产无保障，一般回民群众在苦难的生活中挣扎着。解放后，永久地结束了民族压迫的时代，回民翻身了，得到了与汉族人民一样的平等权利。但是，随着社会经济的恢复和发展，回民所从事的某些落后行业不可避免地要逐渐衰落或被淘汰，因而，在解放后曾有一个时期回民失业人口暂时增多了。中国共产党北京市委和北京市人民政府对这一问题极其重视，当即决定逐步地有计划地帮助回民转业就业，注意吸收回民到工厂企业中去工作。
    当时（一九五一年夏）历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂和歧视还有相当程度地存在着。在汉民方面，认为回民“难斗”“好打架”或怕“麻烦”，因而有些厂、矿、企业部门不愿意甚至公开拒绝吸收回民参加工作；在回民方面则有很大的顾虑，怕“受气”、怕自己的“生活习惯不被尊重”等。另外，回民由于长期过着分散的小商贩经济生活，轻视生产劳动，有“好汉不挣有数钱”的资本主义投机思想和缺乏集体生活的习惯，而不愿参加工作。这样，回民转业就业问题遇到了严重的障碍。为了扫除这些思想障碍，北京市的党政领导一方面对全体干部和人民群众不断地进行民族政策的宣传教育工作，批判大民族主义思想；一方面决定开办政治训练班以教育回民。
    北京市人民政府民政局举办了少数民族业余政治训练班，对少数民族（主要是回民）进行了民族团结、劳动光荣，以及爱国主义与国际主义的教育。
    三年以来，北京市共举办了九期训练班（包括牛羊肉业转业人员训练班），训练了六千二百四十四人（回民占百分之九十强），其中经介绍到机关、工矿、企业部门正式参加工作的已有三千四百八十余人，若再加上各方面直接吸收的，现共有八千余人（不包括中央、华北级机关及在京部队中的回民）参加了工作。我们介绍工作的办法是：首先与劳动部门及较大的工厂、企业建立了密切的联系，保证介绍去的人合乎条件（文化不足者事先补习）；然后成批地介绍，并尽先介绍历史清楚、思想认识正确、比较积极优秀的学员就业。这样就打破了用人单位对吸收回民的顾虑，并可免除用人单位的一些实际困难，回民也安心。经介绍就业的不少学员在工作或生产中已当了模范。根据最近对二十一个生产单位的调查，因工作成绩突出受到表扬的共八十三人。同时，还协同政府有关部门经常了解就业回民的生活情况，帮助他们解决遇到的困难，并进行应有的教育，以巩固和不断提高他们的工作积极性。
    随着回民的广泛就业，而提出了另一个问题——回民伙食问题。它不仅关系到回民切身的、特殊的利益，也关系到回民的工作情绪和生产问题。我们本着华北行政委员会民族事务委员会和财政管理局的联合指示，规定了以下几种办法：回民工作人员，可单独立伙，人数过少者，按小伙食单位补助办法给予适当补助；对未成立伙食单位而必须在外购食者，每人每月补助一定数量的伙食费。工矿、企业部门也参照上述办法给回民以适当照顾。根据一九五三年八月的普遍调查证明，这个问题已基本上获得解决。
    现在北京市的回民已经改变了旧的面貌。回民中一向流传的“回回道窄”（即谋生的范围很狭窄的意思）不复存在了。北京的机关、工厂、学校、企业、合作社、银行……到处都可以看到新参加工作的回民青年男女在工作和生产着。随着生活的改善，文化教育也有很大的发展。一九四九年时回民中学生只六百余人，小学学生只二千七百余人；现在中学学生已有二千七百四十余人，小学学生九千八百三十余人（占学龄儿童的百分之九十七），还有了专科以上的学生三百六十余人。各种文娱体育活动也日益广泛地开展起来。回民的文化教育事业所以能这样发展，是与他们有了进步的、稳固的经济基础分不开的。
    民族团结也空前加强了。北京解放后由于国民党反动统治留下的影响，在一九四九年的十个月中回汉民间较大的民族纠纷事件就有四十八起之多，一九五○年也有二十八起，自一九五一年六月至今一件也未发生过。这不是说：像一九四九年时曾引起民族纠纷的事情不发生了，而是说：像那样的事情发生后，人民群众特别是回民都能本团结互助、批评和自我批评的精神自行解决了。
    回民内部也起了深刻的变化，即在回民中已经有了相当强大的先进的工人阶级。
    “不是共产党、不是人民政府、不是毛主席，回民那能有今天”，这是回民中很普遍的一句话。
