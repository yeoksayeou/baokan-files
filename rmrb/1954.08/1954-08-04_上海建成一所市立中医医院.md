Shanghai Builds a Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital

The Shanghai Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital has been completely constructed and was inspected and accepted by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau on July 29th. After the establishment of this traditional Chinese medicine hospital, in addition to accepting outpatient and inpatient treatment, it will mainly conduct research on traditional Chinese medicine through clinical practice, in order to sort out and promote the motherland's medical heritage and better serve the people's health care cause.

The hospital plans to temporarily set up internal medicine (including gynecology), pediatrics, and acupuncture departments, and establish a special academic committee to concentrate experts from various departments to conduct research on traditional Chinese medicine.
