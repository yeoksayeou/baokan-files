Xinhua News Agency, August 16th: Rangoon dispatch: The Central Executive Committee of the Burmese World Peace Defense Committee issued a statement on the 8th, opposing the U.S.'s organization of a Southeast Asian aggression bloc, and urging Asian countries to take joint action to safeguard Asian peace.

    The statement first endorsed the Burmese government's recent announcement refusing to participate in the Southeast Asian aggression bloc. The statement said: The so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group" planned by the United States is just a path "leading to war in Asia and causing Asian people to kill each other."

    The statement said: Only by following the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence established in the joint statements issued by the Prime Ministers of China and Burma and the Prime Ministers of China and India can peace and security in Asia be achieved. The statement finally urged other Asian countries to participate in joint action based on these principles to safeguard peace in Asia.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 17th: The Czechoslovakian "Red Right Newspaper" commented on the U.S.'s conspiracy to assemble a Southeast Asian aggression bloc on the 16th, saying that the main purpose of the planned aggression bloc is to suppress the national liberation movements of the Asian people, interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, attempt to use Asians to fight Asians, and attempt to launch a war against China.

    The newspaper then said that the U.S. war-mongering group wants to undermine the achievements of the Geneva Conference, which has promoted peace in Asia and eased international tensions. They attempt to lure Asian countries into participating in aggressive groups by giving so-called economic "aid." But the experience of dealing with U.S. imperialism tells Asians: "As soon as American economic 'aid' begins, the national independence of the country receiving this 'aid' is forfeited."

    The "Red Right Newspaper" mentioned that India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon oppose this group, and said that this fact, along with the success of the Geneva Conference and the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Burma, proves that the Asian people do not want anything like the U.S.'s warmongering plan.

    "Youth Front Newspaper" also published a commentary on the 15th condemning the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, saying: "All the plans of the planners of this conspiracy, which further threatens world peace, will be defeated, because the people of Asian countries have decided to live independently and peacefully, and refuse to shed blood in a fratricidal war for the benefit of greedy colonialists."

    反对美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团制造战争
    捷报谴责美国拼凑东南亚集团威胁世界和平
    【新华社十六日讯】仰光消息：缅甸保卫世界和平委员会中央执行委员会八日发表一项声明，反对美国筹组东南亚侵略集团，并促请亚洲国家共同行动以保障亚洲和平。
    声明首先拥护缅甸政府最近宣布的拒绝参加东南亚侵略集团的措施。声明说：美国策划的所谓
  “东南亚防御集团”只是一条“导致亚洲战争、并使亚洲人民互相残杀”的道路。
    声明说：只有遵循中缅总理、中印总理发表的联合声明中所确立的和平共处的五项原则才能获致亚洲的和平与安全。声明最后促请亚洲其他国家根据这些原则参加共同行动以保障亚洲的和平。
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”十六日评论美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团的阴谋活动说，策划中的侵略集团的主要目的是镇压亚洲人民的民族解放运动，干涉亚洲各国人民的内政，企图用亚洲人打亚洲人，企图发动对中国的战争。
    这家报纸接着说，美国战争贩子集团要破坏日内瓦会议的成就，日内瓦会议已经促进了亚洲的和平，并缓和了国际紧张局势。他们企图以给予所谓经济“援助”来诱骗亚洲各国参加侵略性的集团。但是和美帝国主义打交道的经验告诉亚洲人：“只要是美国的经济‘援助’一开始，接受这种‘援助’的国家的民族独立就断送了。”
    “红色权利报”提到印度、印尼、缅甸和锡兰反对这个集团时说，这个事实和日内瓦会议的成功及中印、中缅两国总理联合声明同样证明，亚洲人民不要任何像美国的好战计划这一类的东西。
    “青年阵线报”也在十五日发表评论也在谴责东南亚公约组织说：“这个进一步威胁世界和平的阴谋的策划者的一切打算将遭到失败，因为亚洲各国人民已经决定要独立地、和平地生活，拒绝为了贪婪的殖民者的利益来在自相残杀的战争中流血。”
