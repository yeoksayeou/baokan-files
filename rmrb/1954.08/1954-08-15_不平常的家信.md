    An Unusual Letter from Home
    Jiang Taizhen

    I was racking my brains over a difficult math problem when the mail clerk came in and gently said to me, "Comrade Jiang Taizhen, here's a letter and a package for you."
      "A letter from home?" I looked at the mail clerk with surprise, because I don't have any relatives left at home, so where would a letter from home come from?
      "Yes, a letter from home! The letter and the package are both from the same place," the mail clerk said very positively, handing me the letter and the package.
    I took it hesitantly, examining the handwriting on the envelope and package, which only confused me more: I am from Hunan, but the envelope and package clearly say: "Sent from Baisha Town, Yuxian County, Henan." Curiosity led me to unpack the package first. The wrapping was a piece of brand-new white cotton cloth, sewn very tightly, with layers of old white cloth inside. After unwrapping it to the end, I discovered it was a brand-new notebook. Who sent this? Why send a notebook? Finally, I realized I should open the letter first! With a feeling of doubt and expectation, I opened the letter and immediately saw: "Taizhen, my good child, you probably never expected to receive this letter from me!" Seeing this, I was even more baffled and quickly continued reading:
      "When I finished my comfort work and returned home from the delegation, I framed the two 'undeliverable' merit citations you gave me and hung them on the wall. Seeing them is like seeing you; seeing you is like seeing my son who sacrificed in the Liberation War! Since we met that time, I have been thinking of you day and night. Child, you unfortunately lost your family in the War of Resistance Against Japan, but that doesn't matter. If you are willing, please treat me as your own mother! To show my motherly affection, I am sending a notebook, which was one of the prizes I received from the province when I was selected as a model for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families. I am also sending a recent photo taken especially for you."
    It turned out that this was sent by Wang Xiuluan, the elderly model for families of revolutionary martyrs in her fifties, from the delegation to comfort the People's Liberation Army.
    I remember: our only meeting was at a symposium. At that time, everyone was moved by her generosity in dedicating her son to the country, by her leadership of women in production, her promotion of the General Line, and her lead in selling surplus grain. Comrades all called her "the soldiers' mother." To show my respect for her, I gave her the two merit citations I had received, which I had no place to send. At the time, she happily accepted them in her capacity as "the soldiers' mother." Originally, this matter had already made me feel greatly comforted, but now, this heroic mother, respected by everyone, had agreed to be my own mother.
    I took out her photo from the envelope. I held the photo in my hands, gazing at her wrinkled forehead, kind eyes, benevolent face, and the shining medal on her chest, and tears of emotion welled up from my eyes...
    Wiping away my tears, I thought again about the math problem in front of me. A new force stirred within me, and I seemed to become especially clever. The problem was quickly solved. (Attached photo)

    不平常的家信
    蒋泰真
    我正在为一道数学难题想得头痛的时候，收发员同志走了进来，轻轻地对我说：“蒋泰真同志，这里有你一封家信，还有一个包裹。”
      “家信？”我用惊奇的眼光望着收发员，因为我家里早已连一个亲人都没有了，哪里来的家信？
      “是的，家信！信和包裹还都是一个地方寄来的。”收发员同志一边非常肯定地这样说，一边就把信和包裹递给我。
    我犹疑地接过来，端详着信封和包裹皮上的字迹，更使我摸不着头脑了：我是湖南人，而信封和包裹皮上却明明写着：“寄自河南禹县白沙镇。”一种好奇使我首先去打包裹，包裹皮是块崭新的白市布，缝口缝得很结实，里边还用次旧的白布包了一层又一层，拆到最后才发现是一个崭新的学习本子，这是什么人寄的呢？为什么要寄个学习本子呢？最后我才想到首先应该打开信看看才对啊！我怀着一种犹疑和期待的心情拆开那封信，第一眼就看到：“泰真，我的好孩子，你该想不到我会给你写这封信吧！”看到这里，我更加莫名其妙起来，连忙继续读下去：
      “当我结束慰问工作，从慰问团回到家里的时候，我就把你送给我的两张你从前‘没处寄’的立功喜报用镜框子装起来挂在墙上，见了它，就像见了你；见了你，就像见了我那在解放战争中牺牲了的儿子呵！自从那次和你见面以后，我日夜都在思念着你。孩子，在抗日战争中，你不幸地失去了亲人，不过，这没有关系，要是你愿意，就请把我当做你的亲妈妈吧！为了表示做妈妈的一点心意，随信寄去一个学习本子，这是我当选拥军优属模范时省里给我的奖品之一，另外寄上一张最近特为你照的照片。”
    原来这是慰问人民解放军代表团里的那位五十多岁的烈属模范王秀鸾老大娘寄给我的。
    还记得：我们仅仅一次会见是在一次座谈会上。那时大家都为她慷慨地为祖国献出自己的儿子，为她领导妇女参加生产，宣传总路线，带头卖余粮的事迹所感动，同志们都用“战士的妈妈”称呼她。为了表示对她的敬爱之情，我曾把自己先后两次立功都没处可寄的喜报送给了她，当时，她也欣然以“战士的妈妈”的身分接受了。本来，这件事已经使我感到很大的安慰，可是现在，这位人人敬爱的英雄的母亲，却答应作我的亲妈妈了。
    我从信封里取出了她的照片，我把照片捧在手里，对着她那多皱的前额，善良的眼睛，慈祥的面孔和胸前灿烂的奖章出神，激动的眼泪从我的眼里连串地涌出……
    揩干了眼泪，我又想起了摆在面前的那道算术难题。一种新的力量激动着我，我仿佛变得特别聪明起来，难题很快就解决了。（附图片）
