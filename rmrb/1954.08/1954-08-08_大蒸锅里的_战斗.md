    The “Battle” in the Big Steaming Pot
    Wang Dianguan, Wang Renjun
    At two o'clock on the night of June 12th, while Wang Qitang's team at the Qingdao Food Industry Company's No. 1 Vegetable Oil Factory was engaged in intense production, the shaft of the large steaming pot suddenly stopped. After inspection by the workers, it was discovered that a six-point screw cap was stuck between the stirring blade and the pot wall. Everyone watched the scorching hot pot with anxiety and helplessness.
    The young oil pressing worker Guo Xuezhou paced anxiously. "If we wait for the pot to cool down before repairing it, it will take at least six or seven hours, and this month's production plan will be unfulfilled!" Thinking of this, he quickly found several sacks, a hammer, and a steel chisel, and came to the large steaming pot. Someone asked him, "Xiao Guo, what are you doing?" He said, "I'm going in." "The pot is so hot, don't you want to live?" Someone warned him, but he said, "It's okay! I'll give it a try, tie the sacks around me."
    The workers carefully helped Guo Xuezhou onto the pot opening. He gritted his teeth and climbed in. As soon as his body went in, sweat poured out all over him. He moved forward lying down, and as soon as he shifted, his right shoulder touched a steam pipe, and with a "sizzle" sound, a piece of skin was burned off. The workers heard him say "Ah-ya!" and quickly asked, "What's wrong? Xiao Guo, what's wrong?" He said from inside the pot, "It's nothing, quickly pass me the tools." Guo Xuezhou lay on the stirring blade, aimed the chisel at the screw cap with his left hand, and when he raised his right arm, another piece of skin was burned off by the scorching hot pipe. At this time, the sweat flowing from his head had blurred his eyes. He hammered, but the hammer missed and smashed his finger. He wiped his eyes with his arm, endured the high heat and pain, and continued to chisel. After a few minutes, the chisel was split, but only a small piece of the screw cap was chiseled off. At this time, the workers told him to come out to rest and replace him with another person. But he thought that if someone else went in, they would face the same difficulties, so he continued to persist in his work.
    Guo Xuezhou changed to a larger chisel and continued to chisel. Sweat flowed down like a torrential downpour, the burns stung like they were being pinched by pliers, and the distilled water dripping from the upper part of the pot pricked his body like steel needles. He felt smoke in his throat, his head buzzed as if it was about to explode, and his whole body trembled involuntarily. In this moment where every second was hard to bear, he thought of the heroic spirit of the volunteers in overcoming difficulties and self-sacrifice. He gritted his teeth and chiseled for half an hour, and the screw cap was finally chiseled to pieces.
    Guo Xuezhou was helped out of the pot by the workers. His sweat had soaked through the sacks, many blisters had formed on his body, several places had been burned raw, and blood was still flowing from his finger. The workers were moved and gathered around to comfort him. He said, "It's okay, let's hurry up and get back to production!"

    大蒸锅里的“战斗”
    王殿观　王仁君
    六月十二日夜里两点钟，青岛食品工业公司第一植物油厂王启堂小组正在紧张生产的时候，大蒸锅的转轴突然停住了。经工人们检查，发现大蒸锅的搅板翅与锅皮之间，卡了一个六分大的螺丝帽。大家眼看着滚热的蒸锅，干着急没办法。
    青年榨油工郭学周急得直打转。“等着锅凉了再进去修理，起码也得六、七个钟头，这月的生产计划就完不成啦！”想到这里，他赶忙找了几条麻袋，一把铁锤和一把钢凿，来到大蒸锅跟前。有人问他：“小郭，你干嘛？”他说：“我进去。”“锅这么热，你不想活啦？”有人提出了警告，但是他说：“不要紧！试试看，你们把麻袋给我捆上。”
    工人们小心地把郭学周扶上了锅口，他把牙一咬就往里爬。身子刚爬进去，汗水“唰”地出遍了全身。他卧着身子向前移动，刚一窜，右肩膀就碰上了汽管子，“吱啦”一声烫破了一块皮。工人们听到他“啊呀”一声，连忙问道：“怎么啦？小郭，怎么啦？”他在锅里说：“没有什么，快把家伙递给我。”郭学周趴在搅板翅上，左手把凿子对准螺丝帽，右胳膊一抬又被滚热的管子烫去了一块皮。这时，他头上流下来的汗水，已经把眼睛浸得看不清楚了。他头一锤打偏了，砸破了手指。他用胳膊擦了一下眼睛，忍受着高热和疼痛，继续凿起来。几分钟之后，凿子被砸劈了，可是螺丝帽仅凿下很小的一块。这时，工人们叫他出来休息，另换一个人。但他想到别人进去，也是同样的困难，仍继续坚持工作。
    郭学周换了一个大凿子，继续凿着。汗水像瓢浇似的往下淌，烫伤像被钳子钳住一样的疼，锅上层滴下来的蒸馏水，又像钢针一样向身上乱扎。他觉得嗓子里冒烟，脑袋像要炸开似地“轰轰”直响，周身不由自主地颤抖起来。在这每一秒钟都难熬过的时候，他想起了志愿军克服困难和自我牺牲的英勇精神，狠狠地咬着牙，一个劲地凿了半个钟头，螺丝帽终于被凿碎了。
    郭学周被工人们从锅里扶出来，汗水浸透了麻袋，身上烫起了很多水泡，好几处被烫去了一层皮，手指的血还在流着。工人们感动得围上来慰问，他说：“不要紧，赶紧生产吧！”
