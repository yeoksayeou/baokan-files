Strengthen Leadership Over Literary Translation Work

In recent years, literary translation work has greatly developed. A large number of foreign literature, especially Soviet literature, has been translated and published. The print run of each edition is tens of thousands for the smaller ones, and hundreds of thousands or even more than a million copies for the larger ones. The broad masses of readers draw rich spiritual nourishment from these translated works, which are rich in ideological and educational significance. Young people and students regard excellent literary works such as "How Steel Was Tempered" and "The Story of Zoya and Shura" as their guidelines for study, life, and action.

From the perspective of carrying out cultural and communist ideological education for young people, and from the perspective of cultural exchange and enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between people of all countries, literary translation work is very important. It is completely wrong to look down on literary translation work.

However, the phenomenon of insufficient attention to literary translation work does exist. First of all, some translators themselves lack a serious work attitude and their work is sloppy; even a few people, driven by bourgeois individualism and the desire for fame and profit, take advantage of the urgent need of the broad masses for progressive literary translations and regard literary translation work as a shortcut to making profits, resulting in bad practices such as rushing to translate, translating haphazardly, and translating carelessly.

Some irresponsible publishing houses, in order to make money, rush to publish crude and poorly translated versions, causing multifaceted material and spiritual losses and waste, and encouraging bad translation practices. As soon as some original works arrive in the country, there are already two or three, or even seven or eight different translations being published and distributed on the market at the same time.

However, in general newspapers and periodicals, and in literary journals, there are very few reviews that distinguish the merits of these translations. Translators rarely have the opportunity to receive encouragement, praise, or critical education, and readers do not receive appropriate guidance on how to choose.

The phenomenon of a certain degree of "no one caring" in literary translation work has affected the inability to improve the quality of literary translation work. Crude, distorted, and erroneous translations hinder the dissemination of excellent literary works and damage the spirit of the original works. Grammatically incorrect translations also have a bad impact on the language training of young people and students.

The masses urgently demand the improvement of literary translation work, the improvement of the planning of translation work, and that those engaged in translation fully recognize the importance of their work. If they can do this, if they can learn from Lu Xun and Qu Qiubai's serious work attitude, and use the famous translations of these two outstanding translators as examples to improve their work, the masses will thank them.

On the one hand, the sense of responsibility of translators must be strengthened and translation skills must be improved; on the other hand, the work of revising and editing translations must also be strengthened. Some editorial departments and publishing houses have put in effort in this regard, but some publishing institutions lack processing of translations altogether, or if they do, they do it very poorly. The method of translation requiring revision should be advocated, mutual assistance and cooperation between translators should be advocated, and the labor of revisers and editors should be recognized through material rewards and spiritual encouragement.

Cultural and publishing departments, literary organizations, and book and journal editorial departments must find ways to strengthen the organization and leadership of literary translation work and overcome the unplanned and backward phenomena that still exist.

Recently, the Chinese Writers Association is going to hold a national literary translation work conference, which is very timely. The literary and art circles should carry out research and criticism of literary translation work.

Readers eagerly expect to read more faithful, fluent, artistic translations of classical and modern literature that can convey the spirit of the original works!

### 加强对文学翻译工作的领导

    加强对文学翻译工作的领导
    近几年来，文学翻译工作有很大的发展。外国文学、特别是苏联文学作品的翻译和出版的数量很大。每种印数少的有几万册，多的有几十万册以至一百万册以上。广大读者从这些富于思想教育意义的翻译作品中，吸取丰富的精神的养料。青年、学生把“钢铁是怎样炼成的”“卓娅与舒拉的故事”等优秀的文学读物当作自己的学习、生活和行动的指针。
  从对青年进行文化教育、共产主义思想教育来说，从交流文化、增进各国人民间的相互了解和友谊来说，文学翻译工作都是非常重要的。看轻文学翻译工作，是完全不应该的。
    但是对文学翻译工作的不够重视的现象并不是不存在的，首先就是，有些翻译工作者本身缺乏严肃的劳动态度，工作做得很马虎；甚至有少数人利用广大群众对进步文学译本的迫切的需要，受着资产阶级个人名利心的驱使，竟把文学翻译工作看成了赢利的捷径，以致产生了抢译、乱译、草率赶译等恶劣作风。
    有些不负责任的出版社为了赚钱，抢着出版粗制滥造的译本，造成多方面的物质和精神上的损失和浪费，助长了不好的翻译作风。若干原作刚到国内不久，就已经有两三种、甚至七八种不同的译本，同时在市上发行。
    可是，在一般报刊上，在文艺性质的刊物上，却很少看到判别这些译本的优劣的评论，译者很少机会受到鼓励表扬或者批评教育，读者也得不到适当的指导，不知道怎样去选择。
    文学翻译工作方面的某种程度的“无人过问”的现象，影响了文学翻译工作的质量的不能提高。粗糙的、歪曲的、错误的翻译，妨碍了优秀文学作品的传布，损害了原作的精神。文理不通的译文，使青年、学生的语文训练也受到不好的影响。
    群众迫切要求改进文学翻译工作，要求提高翻译工作的计划性，要求从事翻译的人充分认识自己工作的重要性。如果他们能够这样做，如果他们能够学习鲁迅、瞿秋白的严肃的工作态度，把这两位杰出的翻译者的著名译本作为榜样，来改进自己的工作，群众是会感谢他们的。
    一方面必须加强翻译工作者的责任心和提高翻译技巧；另一方面也必须加强对译文的校订编辑工作。有些编辑部、出版社在这方面是花了工夫的，但也有些出版机构却根本缺乏对译文的加工，或者虽然有，却做得很差。应该提倡翻译必须经过校订的方法，应该提倡翻译者之间的互助合作，应该通过物质的报酬和精神上的鼓励，来承认校订者和编辑者的劳动。
    文化、出版部门、文艺团体和书刊编辑部必须设法加强对文学翻译工作的组织和领导，克服目前还存在的无计划和落后现象。
    最近中国作家协会要召开全国文学翻译工作会议，这是很适时的。文艺界应该开展对文学翻译工作的研究和批评。
    读者殷切期望读到更多的、忠实的、晓畅的、能够传达原作精神的、富于艺术性的古典和现代文学翻译作品！
