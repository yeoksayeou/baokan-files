Building Pastoral Water Conservancy Projects on the Grassland

A new river channel for pastoral use—the Hui River Diversion Project—has been newly built on the Hulunbuir Grassland in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The construction of this new river channel is of great significance for the development of the pastoral economy. It can help the people of all ethnic groups in the Hunhen Hulei Ranch area solve the difficulty of lacking drinking water for livestock and expand the area of grassland utilization. After the completion of the entire project, 100,000 livestock can graze here; in three to five years, pasture irrigation can also be carried out. According to preliminary estimates, 14,000 hectares of pasture can be irrigated.

Before the construction of the Hui River Diversion Channel, a large pasture of about 2,400 square *hua li* from Samusgen Xilin to Helimutu had good grass, but it could not be used for a long time due to lack of water. In order to turn the pasture with grass but lacking water into a pasture with lush water and grass, the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, after deciding to carry out the Hui River Diversion, sent technical cadres and workers this year and invested a large amount of funds to cooperate with the Hulunbuir League People's Government, officially starting the construction of this pastoral water conservancy project on June 1. All the workers and cadres participating in the construction project overcame the difficulties in life and construction, and by the end of June, they had built two sections of river channel with a total length of 2,776 meters, a bottom width of 4 meters, and an average depth of about 1 meter. In the near future, when the weir dam project is completed and water is released, the water of the Hui River will flow continuously into the Hunhen Hulei Ranch along the newly built river channel.

    草原上兴建牧业水利工程
    在内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔草原上新建了一条牧业用水河道——辉河分流工程。这一新河道的兴建，对发展牧业经济有重大意义。它能帮助胡很浩莱牧场一带的各族牧民解决牲畜饮水缺乏的困难，并能扩大草原利用面积。全部工程竣工后，将有十万头牲畜可在此地放牧；在三五年以后还可进行牧草灌溉，据初步估计，能灌溉一万四千公顷牧场。
    在辉河分流河道没有兴修以前，从萨木斯根锡勒起，到合力木图，约两千四百平方华里的大牧场中，虽然草好，但因缺水长期不能利用。内蒙古自治区人民政府水利局，为使有草缺水的牧场变成水草并茂的牧场，在确定进行辉河分流之后，今年即派去技术干部和工人，并投入大量资金，配合呼伦贝尔盟人民政府，从六月一日正式开始了这一牧业水利工程的兴建。全体参加兴建工程的工人和干部，克服了生活上和施工中的重重困难，在六月底就修好长达两千七百七十六公尺，底宽四公尺，平均深度一公尺左右的两段河道。在不久的将来，等到滚水坝工程完成开始放水后，辉河的河水，便会顺着新修的河道源源不断地流入胡很浩莱牧场。
