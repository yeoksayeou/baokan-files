Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, August 25th: The Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Committee has been working since July 27th and has been cooperating with the International Supervisory and Control Commission since August 13th.

During this period, the two main issues that were most intensely discussed were the issue of transferring prisoners of war and detained civilians, and the issue of implementing a ceasefire throughout Vietnam.

The agreement on the transfer of prisoners of war and detained civilians, signed in mid-August, was a major achievement of the meetings. In this agreement, the locations, times, and methods of transfer are specifically stipulated to ensure the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords, which stipulate that both parties must mutually transfer all prisoners of war and detained civilians.

The methods of the ceasefire have also been fairly resolved and specifically stipulated in several agreements reached. On this point, the two sides have reached supplementary agreements on the following issues: clearing mines; demarcating a temporary north-south air corridor; establishing a sub-committee in North Vietnam; and the methods for establishing other joint ceasefire sub-committees in the Fourth Interzone, Fifth Interzone, and South Vietnam.

From August 13th to 20th, three agreements were gradually reached on the following issues: the method of demarcating a temporary military demarcation line; the method of demarcating a demilitarized zone; the time limit for each side to concentrate its troops; the demarcation of temporary assembly areas in central and northern Vietnam, and the issue of air transport for French Union forces.

During the meetings, the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, based on the agreements reached in Geneva and the specific situation in Vietnam, put forward fair and reasonable proposals. Many of these proposals were initially opposed by the delegation of the General Command of the French Union Forces, but due to the great efforts of the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, and to some extent also due to the understanding of the delegation of the General Command of the French Union Forces, agreements were finally reached.

During this period, the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army also dispatched three delegations composed of officers to the Fourth Interzone, Fifth Interzone, and South Vietnam to convey the ceasefire order and establish local joint ceasefire committees. The concrete result is that since July 27th in North Vietnam, since August 1st in central Vietnam, and since August 11th in South Vietnam, the firing of the Vietnam People's Army has completely ceased, all mines on all transportation lines under the control of the Vietnam People's Army have been cleared, and no significant conflicts have occurred.

Vietnam has a long front line, complex geographical conditions, and the positions of the two sides' armies are intricate. In addition, the Vietnam People's Army is composed of regular troops, local troops, militias, and guerrillas. Therefore, it was necessary to act separately from the coastal areas to the remote jungle areas, and there were many difficulties in terms of communication and transportation. However, the Vietnam People's Army overcame all these difficulties, implemented the ceasefire order of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, and correctly complied with the agreements reached in Geneva and the agreements reached at the local military meetings.

On the other hand, the delegation of the General Command of the French Union Forces generally demonstrated a spirit of understanding at the meetings. However, people cannot ignore the violations of the ceasefire agreement committed by the French Union Forces on the battlefields of North Vietnam, central Vietnam, and South Vietnam, such as destroying public property, looting, killing, raping, French military aircraft violating airspace, and most seriously, forcing residents to migrate and infringing upon their lives and property.

These actions are in complete violation of the terms of the agreements reached at the Geneva Conference and at the local military conferences. As long as this situation continues, it will seriously hinder the restoration of peace in Indochina. The Vietnamese people urge the General Command of the French Union Forces and its delegation participating in the Central Joint Ceasefire Committee to immediately stop these violations of the agreement and severely punish those who instigated these actions.

After this period of work, the meetings of the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Committee have made considerable progress and show that even greater achievements will be made in the future. What must be done now is that both sides should earnestly respect and strictly abide by the agreements that have been concluded, so that the ceasefire can be realized from north to south, and all prisoners of war and detained civilians can be transferred.

The army and people of Vietnam, implementing the instructions of President Ho Chi Minh, have always respected and will continue to respect the terms of the agreements. They expect and urge the General Command of the French Union Forces in Indochina and the French Union Forces to do the same. Only in this way can the Joint Ceasefire Committee achieve good results.

    越南联合停战委员会最近期间的工作情况
    【新华社二十五日讯】越南通讯社北越二十五日讯：从七月二十七日到八月二十日，越南中央联合停战委员会一直在进行工作。从八月十三日起，这个委员会并且同国际监督和监察委员会进行合作。
    在这期间，讨论最热烈的两个主要问题是：移交战俘和被拘平民问题，以及在越南全境实行停火问题。
    在八月月中签订的关于移交战俘和被拘平民的协议，是会议的一个巨大成就。在这个协议中，具体地规定了移交地点、时间和方式，以保证严格履行日内瓦协定。日内瓦协定规定，双方要互相移交全部战俘和被拘平民。
    停火的方式也已在一些达成的协议中得到公正的解决和具体的规定。在这一点上，双方已就下列问题达成了补充协议：清除地雷；划定一条从北到南的临时空中走廊；在北越设立一个小组委员会以及在第四联区、第五联区和南越设立其他联合停战小组委员会的方式。
    从八月十三日到二十日，曾逐步就下列问题达成三个协议：划定一条临时军事分界线的方式；划定非军事区的方式；任何一方集结部队的时限；在中越划定临时集结区以及法兰西联邦部队空运问题。
    会议中，越南人民军总司令部代表团根据在日内瓦达成的协定和越南的具体情况，提出了公正而合理的建议。这些建议中的许多地方在起初曾遭到法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团的反对，但是由于越南人民军总司令部代表团的巨大努力，以及在某种程度上也由于法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团的谅解，终于达成了协议。
    在这期间，越南人民军总司令部还派遣了由军官组成的三个代表团到第四联区、第五联区和南越去传达停火令，并设立当地联合停战委员会。具体的结果是北越自从七月二十七日以后、中越自从八月一日以后、南越自从八月十一日以后，越南人民军的射击已完全停止了，在越南人民军控制下的一切交通线上的地雷都已经扫清了，并且没有发生过显著的冲突。
    越南的战线长，地理情况复杂，双方军队驻扎的阵地错综；此外，越南人民军是由正规部队、地方部队、民兵和游击队组成的，所以，从沿海地区一直到遥远的丛林地区，不得不分别行事，在通讯和运输方面有很多困难。然而，越南人民军克服了所有这些困难，执行了越南人民军总司令部的停火令、正确地遵守了在日内瓦达成的协定和在当地军事会议上达成的协议。
    另一方面，法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团一般说来在会议上表现了谅解的精神。但是，人们不能忽视法兰西联邦部队在北越、中越和南越各战场上所犯的违反停战协定的行动，例如破坏公共财产，抢劫，杀人，强奸，法军飞机侵犯领空，而最严重的是强迫居民迁移和侵犯他们的生命财产。
    这些行动是完全违反在日内瓦会议和在当地军事会议达成的协议的条款的。只要这种情况仍然继续下去，它就会严重地妨害印度支那和平的恢复。越南人民敦促法兰西联邦部队总司令部和它参加中央联合停战委员会的代表团立即终止这些违反协定的行动，并严惩这些行动的唆使者。
    经过这期间的工作，越南中央联合停战委员会的会议取得不少的进展，并显示以后还会取得更大的成就。目前必须做的是，双方应认真地尊重并严格地遵守已缔结的协定，使停火从北到南都得以实现，一切战俘和被拘平民都得到移交。
    越南的军队和人民执行胡志明主席的指示，一直尊重并将继续尊重诸协定的条款。他们期望并敦促印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令部和法兰西联邦部队也这样做。只有这样，联合停战委员会才能获得良好的成就。
