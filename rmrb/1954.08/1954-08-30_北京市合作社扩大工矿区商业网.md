The Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation is expanding the commercial network in mining and industrial areas. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Consumer Cooperative has successively opened cold food sections, popsicle processing sections, watch repair shops, and bicycle repair shops within the factory and in the Jinding Street dormitory area. Recently, it has also built a new service-oriented store in the Jinding Street dormitory area, including photography, radio, phonograph, and camera repair services. The Shijingshan Power Plant Consumer Cooperative established a distribution point in the newly built Incremental Production Dormitory Area, added internal equipment to the store, and increased the variety of goods such as food, general merchandise, and household appliances by more than 160 items. The Qinghe Woolen Mill Consumer Cooperative opened a sewing department and a small shop outside the east gate of the factory. With the support of the factory, the original store was moved to a new garden site, expanding the business area by one-third, and increasing the variety of goods such as food and household appliances. In addition to establishing a distribution point in the Fangshan Shuiping Mine, the Jingxi Coal Mine Workers' Consumer Cooperative expanded the food sections of the Datai and Chengzi Mine distribution points, as well as the supply of household appliances and wooden products. The Liulihe Cement Plant Consumer Cooperative expanded the East Factory store, established a vegetable station, and increased the variety of goods such as food, non-staple food seasonings, and household appliances.

In addition, consumer cooperatives in industrial and mining areas are also planning to establish cooperative canteens, small canteens兼distribution points, breakfast and snack sections, flour mills, tofu workshops, and other facilities to expand supply.
