The three pairs of modernized vertical shafts, the electrical machinery plant, the measuring tool and cutting tool factory, the electric meter and instrument factory, the new type high-temperature and high-pressure electric heating station, the comprehensive paper mill, and other key projects being built by the state in Heilongjiang Province are under intense construction, and many projects are nearing completion. At the Hegang Dongshan and Shuangyashan Lingxi vertical shaft projects, magnificent buildings such as the winding engine room, the large coal bunker, and the joint welfare building are nearing completion. Workers in more than a dozen trades, including installation, carpentry, and concrete work, have vigorously投入 themselves in the construction of the main shaft, the auxiliary shaft shaft shed, and the headframe. The permanent, crisscrossing horizontal coal mining roadways underground are nearing completion, and the workers are working intensely to prepare the mining area. The electrical and mechanical equipment installation workers have put forward the slogan of "Be well prepared, install one as soon as it arrives." The Hegang Dongshan vertical shaft headframe was initially planned to be installed section by section, which would take about two months to complete. By adopting the advanced "assembly" method, the construction period can be shortened by one month. The workers constructing the Shuangyashan Lingxi vertical shaft and the Jixi Xiaohengshan vertical shaft are also working day and night. These three pairs of vertical shafts are scheduled to be handed over for production by the end of this year. The Harbin Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory is nearing completion. The final part of the factory's construction project—the measuring tool workshop, the central water tower, and the office building—was basically completed half a year ahead of schedule at the end of June. The installation project of the measuring tool workshop is being accelerated. The entire factory is expected to be put into production in October. The equipment installation project of the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant started in mid-January this year, and the main part has now been completed. Some units have already placed orders with the electrical machinery plant. By the end of June, the Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory had completed the foundation projects of factories No. 1 and No. 3, the boiler room, and the dormitory, and the metal structure project of factory No. 1, ahead of schedule. The electric heating station project, after one and a half years of construction, has now taken initial shape. The concrete project of the main factory building, which is forty meters high, has been completely poured, and the mechanical foundation project has been completed by 90%. The factory building is undergoing roof waterproofing and surrounding wall construction. A large number of projects around the main factory building, such as the coal crusher room, the main power distribution room, the induced draft fan room, and the automated coal unloading device, have been completed.

    黑龙江省不少重点工程接近竣工
    国家在黑龙江省兴建的三对近代化的竖井、电机场、量具刃具厂、电表仪器厂、新型高温高压的电热站、综合造纸厂等等重点工程正紧张施工，并有不少工程已接近竣工。鹤岗东山和双鸭山岭西竖井工程的绞车房、大煤仓和联合福利大楼等雄伟建筑物已接近竣工；安装、木工、混凝土工等十几个工种的工人，已大力投入主井、副井井棚及井架的建设，在井下永久性纵横交错的水平采煤巷道已近竣工，工人们正紧张地进行采区的准备。电气机械设备安装工人们提出了“做好准备工作，来一个安一个”的口号。鹤岗东山竖井主井井架开始打算从下一节一节地安装，约需两个月完成，由于采取了“组立”的先进方法，可以缩短工期一个月。双鸭山岭西竖井及鸡西小恒山竖井建设的工人们也是夜以继日地工作着。这三对竖井预定在今年年底移交生产。哈尔滨量具刃具厂即将建成。该厂最后一部分建筑工程——量具厂房、中央水塔及办公大楼，已于六月底提前半年基本完工。量具厂房安装工程正在加速进行。全厂预计在十月投入生产。哈尔滨电机厂的设备安装工程，今年一月中旬开工，现在主要部分已完工。有些单位已向电机厂订货。哈尔滨电表仪器厂，到六月末已提前完成一、三号厂房、锅炉房、宿舍的基础工程，和一号厂房的金属结构工程。电热站工程经过一年又半个月的施工，现已初具规模；高达四十公尺的主厂房混凝土工程已全部浇灌完了，机械基础工程完成了百分之九十，厂房正进行屋面防水及周围砌墙工程。主厂房周围的碎煤机室、主配电室、引风机室，以及自动化的卸煤装置等大批工程已经落成。
