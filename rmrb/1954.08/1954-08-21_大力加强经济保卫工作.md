    Vigorously Strengthen Economic Defense Work

    Our people are intensifying efforts to complete the first Five-Year Plan. The purpose of this plan is to establish the foundation for national industrialization and defense modernization, to ensure the re-equipping of the entire national economy with advanced technology, and to guarantee the construction of our country into a powerful industrial nation capable of crushing any imperialist aggression and counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracies. Precisely because the first Five-Year Plan, especially the socialist industrial construction plan, is extremely important to our country, it has become the central target for enemy sabotage activities. The incident of the counter-revolutionary element Zhong Yin twice sabotaging the combine coal mining machine, published in today's newspaper, is one of the many sabotage incidents carried out by the enemy. In order to achieve his despicable sabotage purpose, this counter-revolutionary element disguised himself as progressive, ostensibly working actively and obeying leadership; but after gradually gaining trust and position, he began to take advantage of the laxity, carelessness of the leadership organs of his unit and the lack of knowledge of combine technology operation among the workers and masses to carry out sabotage activities unscrupulously. The Tangshan City People's Court sentenced such a heinous, incorrigible counter-revolutionary element to death immediately in accordance with the law, which is completely correct and necessary.

    The U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, far before rolling out of mainland China, had already planted a large number of special agents, spies, and other counter-revolutionary elements in industrial, mining, transportation, and other enterprise departments. In the early days of the founding of our country, these elements relied on feudal foremen to frantically resist the takeover by the People's Government, sabotage the restoration of production, and even attempted to coordinate with U.S. imperialist armed aggression in Korea, cooperating with the remaining counter-revolutionary elements in urban and rural areas to subvert our people's revolutionary regime from within. Although a mass movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries has passed, the lurking special agents, spies, and other counter-revolutionary elements have not completely disappeared. In order to sabotage and obstruct our country's socialist construction, they are now emphasizing the so-called "key sabotage" policy. In addition to continuing to use already lurking enemy special agents and counter-revolutionary elements to engage in sabotage, they are also stepping up the search and training of various schemers, traitors to the motherland, and various elements who hate the Chinese people's construction cause. Taking advantage of our country's recruitment of technical personnel and organization of labor employment, they are infiltrating our financial, trade organs, railway transportation enterprises, and water transportation enterprises, especially our industrial and mining enterprises, wearing the guise of "workers," "staff," and "technical personnel," skillfully hiding themselves, and looking everywhere for our gaps and weaknesses in order to carry out sabotage.

    Now, the situation of the struggle against the enemy has undergone great changes. Whether they are remnant or newly dispatched enemy special agents and counter-revolutionary elements, they generally no longer adopt open and blatant methods of sabotage, but rather use double-dealing tactics to carry out concealed sabotage activities. They claim to support and actively participate in our country's socialist construction, putting on various "protective" clothing like chameleons, and even trying their best to disguise themselves as advanced producers, first making some achievements in their work, and then taking the opportunity to infiltrate the internal ranks of the Youth League and the Communist Party to carry out larger-scale sabotage activities. They try every possible means to steal important information about our national defense industry, newly built or expanded factories and mines, national construction plans, international trade, material reserves, etc. Taking advantage of their legal positions, taking advantage of the weakness of our enterprise leaders and public security and defense personnel who lack production management knowledge and do not understand technology, under the cover of lies such as "negligence of duty," "low technical level," and "insufficient experience," they deliberately cause errors and omissions in design and planning, provide false information, secretly modify drawings, and even formulate fundamentally incorrect and impractical plans; they implement incorrect command in exploration, testing, and technical guidance, and propose incorrect facilities; making it impossible to implement production and construction plans or causing a large amount of waste and rework, wasting manpower and material resources, and causing disconnections between various departments of the national economy, in order to delay the progress of national construction; in production, they use incorrect methods to operate and manage, reducing output and lowering quality, and deliberately hindering the improvement of workers' safety and welfare conditions; taking advantage of the purely profit-seeking viewpoints and impetuous adventurism of some enterprise personnel, they expand and deepen errors under the slogan of "actively increasing production," superficially increasing production temporarily, but actually damaging important machines and destroying entire factories and mines. At the same time, they do not relax any opportunity to directly sabotage factories, mines, and warehouses, to murder and harm employees; colluding with rogue thieves, they organize large-scale theft of important industrial raw materials and products, theft of state-owned stores and cooperative property, theft of railway cargo, and theft of the public property of collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives. They also use certain shortcomings and errors in our work to systematically spread rumors, sow discord, and undermine the unity between the Party and the workers, technical personnel; organize slowdowns; and hinder the realization of workers' inventions and rationalization proposals. This kind of concealed sabotage activity has become and will continue to be the main means and main aspect of the enemy's struggle against us for a long time to come.

  Many of our comrades in economic work positions do not see the fact that the enemy-us struggle on the economic front is rapidly turning complex and acute, ignoring the serious consequences that counter-revolutionary assassination, sabotage, espionage, and theft activities will cause. They are intoxicated with the achievements of "peaceful production and construction," gradually disarming themselves, and no longer strengthening economic defense work; they do not investigate the origins of people when recruiting personnel; they do not strictly examine obviously suspicious elements, thinking that as long as they show active performance and make some achievements in their work, they will not be counter-revolutionary elements; they do not strictly keep important state secret documents; they tolerate and ignore the phenomenon of theft of state property; when accidents occur, they only look for reasons from a technical perspective, or do not investigate at all, or even if they are investigated, they are not punished according to law. This kind of麻痹轻敌倾向 (paralysis and underestimation of the enemy) has caused us significant losses. The counter-revolutionary element Zhong Yin twice sabotaged the combine coal mining machine, which was the result of the麻痹思想 (paralysis) and bureaucratic style of the Party and government leading cadres of Kailuan Coal Mine and Linxi Mine. The Party and government leaders of Linxi Mine knew that Zhong Yin was a counter-revolutionary criminal who had been sentenced, but because he had some technology and worked "actively," they easily trusted him and allowed him to take on the extremely important technical guidance work of the combine coal mining machine without any principle. After the first sabotage incident occurred, they were still not alert, did not suspect, and did not deal with it promptly, treating it as an ordinary liability accident, so the second sabotage occurred continuously. This shows that if we do not quickly overcome the 麻痹思想 (paralysis) among cadres and resolutely reverse the erroneous tendency of "burying ourselves in production and not asking about politics," then more similar incidents will inevitably continue to occur, seriously affecting the progress of the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

    In order to further strengthen economic defense work, ensure the smooth progress of socialist industrial construction, and ensure the safety of the national transportation industry, commerce, and cooperative commerce, the Party and government leading organs in all enterprises should conduct political vigilance education among the workers and masses, so that everyone understands that the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements and the defense of economic construction are the common tasks of public security and defense personnel and all employees. We must not only engage in labor production bravely and diligently, but also be vigilant at all times to defend our labor achievements. We should use specific examples to expose the enemy's disguise and modus operandi, so that the workers and masses can identify various hidden enemies and fight against them. We must constantly improve and strengthen the anti-espionage and anti-special organizations among the workers and masses—public security and defense committees and safety groups—so that they can fully play the role of assistants to the people's public security organs.

    We should strictly enforce the personnel system, confidentiality system, and production management system of various economic enterprise departments, and correct and prevent the phenomenon of not strictly examining personnel when recruiting them. Immediately eliminate the phenomenon of lax management of important documents and chaotic borrowing systems. We should establish a scientific and strict production management system, especially inspection system, machine sharing system, responsibility system, and shift handover system, strengthen employees' sense of responsibility and labor discipline, to prevent counter-revolutionary sabotage. When accidents occur, they must be seriously investigated to clarify the nature and cause of the accident, and necessary measures must be taken. Because we still lack leadership experience in economic construction today, many enterprise leaders do not understand technology, and the concept of some workers and masses abiding by laws and regulations is not strong enough, it is possible that some liability accidents will continue to occur. The enemy knows this, and of course, they will also use liability accidents or natural accidents as cover to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. In the past year or two, such things have happened repeatedly in our industrial and mining enterprises. Therefore, in the future, as long as accidents occur, especially major accidents, they must be seriously investigated, and we cannot be careless. This is necessary not only for investigating hidden enemies, but also for discovering various shortcomings and errors in our work.

    The people's public security organs must fully strengthen侦察活动 (reconnaissance activities), arrest counter-revolutionary elements hiding in enterprise departments, and protect key projects that are newly built, expanded, and renovated within the first Five-Year Plan, as well as all key parts related to our country's economic lifeline, so that they will not suffer from the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements. The people's judicial organs and the people's procuratorates should vigorously handle major cases that sabotage economic construction, so as to expose the enemy's crimes and educate the workers and masses to improve revolutionary vigilance. If anyone causes enemy sabotage and causes losses due to 麻痹大意 (paralysis and carelessness), the relevant Party and government organs should strictly investigate responsibility and give necessary punishments according to the size of the errors they have committed. Only in this way can we effectively improve our work and make it impossible for all counter-revolutionary elements to take advantage of it.

    Leading personnel, Communist Party members, and Youth League members in all economic departments should work hard to learn and master production technology. Public security and defense personnel in economic departments should also learn the necessary production knowledge and technical knowledge more quickly, so that hidden counter-revolutionary elements cannot deceive us. This road is arduous and difficult, but we must start walking it immediately, and we must not have any hesitation or fear of difficulty.

    大力加强经济保卫工作
    我国人民正在加紧完成第一个五年建设计划。这个计划的目的是要建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础，保证用先进技术重新装备整个国民经济，保证把我国建设成为能够粉碎任何帝国主义侵略和反革命复辟阴谋的强大的工业国。正因为第一个五年建设计划特别是社会主义工业建设计划，对于我们国家十分重要，所以它也就成为敌人进行破坏活动的中心目标。今天本报发表的反革命分子钟茵两次破坏康拜因采煤机的事件，就是敌人所进行的许多破坏事件中的一件。这个反革命分子为了达到卑鄙的破坏目的，曾经伪装进步，表面上积极工作，服从领导；但在逐步骗得信任、骗得地位以后，就开始利用本单位领导机关的麻痹大意、粗枝大叶和职工群众不懂康拜因技术操作的空隙，肆无忌惮地进行破坏活动了。对于这样一个罪大恶极、怙恶不悛的反革命分子，唐山市人民法院依法判处他死刑立即执行，这是完全正确和必要的。
    美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮，远在滚出中国大陆的前夕，就在工矿、交通等企业部门中预伏了大量的特务间谍和其他反革命分子。在我国建国初期，这些分子曾经依托封建把头，疯狂地反抗人民政府的接管，破坏生产的恢复工作，甚至企图策应美帝国主义在朝鲜的武装侵略，与城乡中残余的反革命分子相配合，从内部来颠覆我国人民革命政权。虽然经过了镇压反革命的群众运动，但是，潜伏的特务间谍分子及其他反革命分子并没有完全消声敛迹。他们为了破坏和阻挠我国的社会主义建设，目前正强调所谓“重点破坏”的方针，除了继续利用已经潜伏下来的敌特反革命分子从事破坏以外，还正在加紧搜罗和训练各种阴谋家、祖国的叛徒和各种仇视中国人民建设事业的分子，利用我国招聘技术人员、组织劳动就业等机会，钻进我们的财经、贸易机关、铁路运输企业和水上运输企业中来，特别是钻进我们的工矿企业中来，戴上“工人”“职员”“技术人员”的假面具，巧妙地隐藏起来，到处寻找我们的空隙和弱点，以便实行破坏。
    现在，对敌斗争的形势已经发生了很大的变化，不论是残存的或新近派遣来的敌特反革命分子，一般都不再采取公开的明目张胆的破坏方式，而是施展两面派的手段来进行隐蔽的破坏活动了。他们口称拥护并积极参加我国社会主义建设，像变色的蜥蜴一样披起各种带“保护色”的服装，甚至竭力把自己装扮成先进生产者，先在工作上作出一些成绩，然后乘机钻进青年团、共产党的内部，进行更大规模的破坏活动。他们千方百计地窃取我国国防工业、新建或扩建厂矿、国家建设计划、国际贸易、物资储备等重要情报。利用合法职位，利用我企业领导人员和公安保卫人员缺乏生产管理知识、不懂技术的弱点，在“疏忽失职”、“技术水平不高”、“经验不够”等谎言掩盖下，故意在设计、计划时造成错漏，提供虚假资料，偷改图纸，甚至制定根本不正确、不实际的计划；在勘探、化验、技术指导中实行错误的指挥，提出错误的设施；使生产建设计划无法实行或大量报废返工，浪费人力物力，引起国民经济各部门的脱节，以推迟国家建设的进度；在生产中用不正确的方法来操作管理，使产量减少，质量降低，故意阻挠工人安全和福利状况的改善；利用某些企业人员的单纯营利观点和急躁冒进等错误，在“积极增产”的口号下扩大和加深错误，表面上使生产暂时增长，实际上却损害着重要机器，毁坏着整个厂矿。同时，他们也不放松任何机会来直接破坏工厂、矿井和仓库，凶杀和暗害职工；勾结流氓盗窃分子，有组织地大批盗窃重要工业原料和产品，盗窃国营商店和合作社的财产，盗窃铁路货载，盗窃集体农庄和农业生产合作社的公共财产。他们还利用我们工作上的某些缺点和错误，有计划地进行造谣中伤，挑拨离间，破坏党和工人群众、技术人员相互间的团结；组织怠工活动；阻挠工人的创造发明和合理化建议的实现。这种隐蔽的破坏活动，已经成为并且将在今后长时期内继续成为敌人对我进行斗争的主要手段和主要方面。
  我们有许多经济工作岗位上的同志，竟看不见经济战线上敌我斗争急剧地转向复杂化、尖锐化的事实，无视反革命暗害、破坏、侦探和盗窃活动将会造成的严重后果。他们沉醉于“和平生产建设”的成绩，逐渐解除了自己的武装，不再去加强经济保卫工作；在招收人员时不查清来历；对显然可疑的分子也不严加审查，以为只要他们在工作中表现积极和作出一些成绩，就不会是反革命分子；不严密保管重要的国家机密文件；宽容和无视盗窃国家财产的现象；发生了破坏事故也一味从技术上找原因，或根本不去追查，甚至查清了也不依法惩办。这种麻痹轻敌的倾向，使我们遭受重大的损失。反革命分子钟茵两次破坏了康拜因采煤机，就是利用了开滦煤矿和林西矿党政领导干部的麻痹思想和官僚主义作风的结果。林西矿的党政负责人明知钟茵是一个已判徒刑的反革命犯，但是因为他有点技术，工作“积极”，就对他轻易信赖，毫无原则地让他担任极其重要的康拜因采煤机的技术指导工作。在第一次破坏事件发生以后，他们仍然毫不警觉，也不怀疑，也不作迅速的处理，只当作普通责任事故，因而连续发生了第二次的破坏。这就说明，如果不迅速克服干部中的麻痹思想，不坚决扭转“埋头生产，不问政治”的错误倾向，就必然会有更多的类似事件不断发生，严重影响到国家社会主义工业化和社会主义改造工作的进度。
    为了进一步加强经济保卫工作，保障社会主义工业建设的顺利进行，保障国家交通运输业、商业和合作社商业的安全，一切企业中的党政领导机关应当向职工群众进行政治警惕性的教育，要使每一个人都懂得：反对反革命分子和保卫经济建设的斗争，是公安保卫人员和全体职工的共同任务。我们不仅要英勇勤劳地从事劳动生产，而且要时刻警惕地保卫我们的劳动成果。应该用具体的事例揭露敌人的伪装和活动方式，使职工群众能够识别各种隐蔽敌人，并和他们进行斗争。要不断地健全和加强工人群众中的防奸反特组织——治安保卫委员会、安全小组，使它们充分发挥人民公安机关的助手的作用。
    应该严格各经济企业部门的人事制度、保密制度和生产管理制度，纠正和防止招收人员时不严加审查的现象。立即扫除对重要文件看管不严和借阅制度混乱的现象。应该建立科学的严格的生产管理制度，特别是检查制、机器分担制、责任制、上下班交代制等，加强职工的责任心和劳动纪律，以防止反革命的破坏。发生了事故，必须认真追查，弄清事故的性质和发生的原因，并采取必要的措施。由于我们今天在经济建设上还缺乏领导经验，有许多企业的负责人不懂技术，部分职工群众遵守法律和纪律的观念还不够强，所以有可能继续发生一些责任事故。敌人知道这点，当然也就会用责任事故或自然事故作掩护，进行反革命的破坏活动。最近一两年来，这样的事情在我们的工矿企业中已经屡次发生。因此，今后只要发生了事故，特别是重大的事故，就必须认真追查，不能马虎。这不但是为了清查隐蔽的敌人所必需，也是为了发现我们工作中的各种缺点错误所必需。
    人民公安机关要全力加强侦察活动，捉拿隐藏在企业部门中的反革命分子，保障第一个五年计划内新建、扩建和改建的重点工程，以及一切关乎我国经济命脉的要害部位，使其不致遭受反革命分子的破坏。人民司法机关和人民检察署应该大张旗鼓地处理那些破坏经济建设的重大案件，以揭露敌人的罪恶，教育职工群众提高革命警惕。如果有人因麻痹大意而招致敌人破坏，造成损失，有关的党政机关应该严格追究责任，按照他们所犯错误的大小给予必要的处分。只有这样，才能有效地改进我们的工作，使一切反革命分子无隙可乘。
    一切经济部门中的领导人员、共产党员和青年团员，应当努力学习，精通生产技术。经济部门中的公安保卫人员也要更快地学会必需的生产知识和技术知识，使暗藏的反革命分子不能欺骗我们。这一段路是艰苦的，困难的，但我们必须立即开始走，不能有任何犹疑和畏难的情绪。
