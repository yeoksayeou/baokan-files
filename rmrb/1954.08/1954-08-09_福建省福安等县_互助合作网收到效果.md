    Mutual aid and cooperation networks, a new form of leadership in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, has been adopted in key districts and townships in more than ten counties in Fujian Province, including Luoyuan, Fu'an, and Yunxiao. In just a few months, these districts and townships have seen a new look in production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    In Huangsha Township, Fu'an County, a mutual aid and cooperation network was formed with the old Chen Lijin Cooperative as its core. The cadres of the Chen Lijin Cooperative promptly passed on techniques and experience to the six new cooperatives in the township. After learning from the old cooperative, the new cooperatives sought ways to increase production based on their own circumstances. The production targets of each cooperative were raised from the original 10% to 15% increase to a 17% to 27% increase. At the same time, a contracting system was initially established, and financial and accounting systems were improved, gradually moving towards consolidation. After the establishment of the mutual aid and cooperation network in Jitou Township, Pingnan County, this spring, the cooperative often helped the year-round mutual aid teams through the mutual aid and cooperation network, and the year-round teams helped the temporary mutual aid teams, and absorbed individual farmers to participate in the activities of the mutual aid and cooperation network. Now, five year-round teams are preparing to establish cooperatives, four temporary teams have been transformed into year-round teams, and forty-four individual farmers have joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations.
    Through the activities of the mutual aid and cooperation network, the political, economic, and technical connections between cooperatives and cooperatives, cooperatives and teams, as well as mutual aid and cooperative organizations and the vast number of individual farmers in other regions have also been greatly strengthened, and the relationship has become closer.

    福建省福安等县
    互助合作网收到效果
    互助合作网这一领导互助合作运动的新形式，已在福建省罗源、福安、云霄等十几个县的重点区、乡被采用，短短的几个月中，这些区、乡的生产和互助合作运动便出现了新的面貌。
    福安县黄沙乡以老社陈利金社为核心组成互助合作网，陈利金社的干部便及时向乡内六个新社传授技术和经验，新社学习了老社的经验，根据本社情况找增产窍门，各社的生产指标由原来的增产一成至一成五提高到增产一成七至两成七。同时，也初步建立了包工制、健全了财务、会计制度，逐步走向巩固。屏南县漈头乡今春建立互助合作网后，合作社经常通过互助合作网帮助常年互助组，常年组又帮助临时互助组，并吸收单干农民参加互助合作网的活动，现在已有五个常年组准备办社，四个临时组转成常年组，四十四户单干农民参加了互助合作组织。
    通过互助合作网的活动，其他地区社与社、社与组，以及互助合作组织和广大个体农民在政治、经济、技术上的联系也大大加强了，关系也密切了。
