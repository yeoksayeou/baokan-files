Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: According to a TASS report from Jakarta on August 9th, Antara News Agency reported that the Indonesian government has officially declared that Indonesia will not participate in the military bloc planned by Western countries to be established in Southeast Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: According to the Indian Press Trust, Nepalese Foreign Minister Regmi, while meeting with reporters in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, on the 7th, said that he opposed the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. He said that while people continue to talk about peace and a ceasefire is being implemented in Indochina, discussing the establishment of a group "defense treaty" in Southeast Asia is detrimental to the cause of world peace.

Regmi said that the Sino-Indian friendship resulting from the recent meeting between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru in New Delhi "is a powerful factor in the world today. No country, no matter how powerful, can ignore this common call of 960 million people marching hand in hand towards peace and progress. This will also help to shatter any conspiracy arbitrarily carried out by the group."

    印尼政府正式声明不参加东南亚军事集团
    尼泊尔外交大臣再次表示反对东南亚公约
   【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社雅加达九日讯：据安塔拉通讯社报道，印尼政府正式声明，印尼将不参加西方国家计划在东南亚建立的军事集团。
    【新华社十日讯】据印度新闻处报道，尼泊尔外交大臣雷格米七日在尼泊尔首都加德满都接见记者时说，他反对成立东南亚公约组织。他说，当人们在继续谈论和平以及正在印度支那实行停战的时候，却来谈论在东南亚建立集团“防御公约”，这对于世界和平事业是不利的。
    雷格米说，最近周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理在新德里会谈所产生的中印友谊，“是今天世界上强有力的因素。任何国家不管它多么强大，都不能忽视正在向着和平与进步携手迈进的九亿六千万人的这种共同的呼声。这也会有助于粉碎有关集团所恣意进行的任何阴谋。”
