　　Minority Farmers Increase Salt Consumption
    In the past, farmers of various ethnic groups in Liping County, Guizhou Province, could only eat a small amount of salt each year due to difficult living conditions and inconvenient transportation. Since liberation, the amount of salt consumed by farmers of various ethnic groups has increased year by year. According to a survey of four typical villages with different economic conditions, in 1950, the average person consumed only 6.6 jin of salt per year. In 1953, it increased to 9.12 jin. In the first five months of this year, the average person has already consumed 5.12 jin, which is almost equal to the annual salt consumption per person in 1950.
    In recent years, the production of farmers of various ethnic groups in Liping County has been continuously improving. From the beginning of 1952 to the end of May this year, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have purchased a large amount of local and special products from farmers at reasonable prices, such as timber, gallnuts, native tobacco, and tung oil, totaling more than 25 billion yuan in value, greatly increasing farmers' incomes. In order to facilitate farmers' purchase of salt, the county's state-owned salt stores and many grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have established agency sales and other business relationships. At the same time, the allocation routes of salt have been reasonably adjusted, and salt is directly transported from salt stores in neighboring counties to areas far from the county seat. Since 1952, the local people's government has also allocated large amounts of funds to open the Liping-Rongjiang Highway and repair more than 140 rural roads. In the past, it took four or five days for each person to carry 70 jin of salt from Rongjiang County to Maogong in Liping County, with a transportation cost of 75,000 yuan. After the highway was opened, it only takes two days, and the transportation cost is reduced to 50,000 yuan. All of this has ensured that farmers of all ethnic groups in the area can eat a large amount of salt.

    少数民族农民食盐增多
    贵州省黎平县各族农民过去因为生活困难、交通不便，每年只能吃很少的食盐，解放以后，各族农民的食盐量逐年增加。据四个经济条件不同的典型村的调查，一九五零年，平均每人一年才吃六斤六两盐，一九五三年，增加到九斤十二两；今年头五个月，平均每人已吃五斤十二两，几乎等于一九五零年每人全年的食盐量。
    几年来，黎平县各族农民生产不断提高。从一九五二年初到今年五月底，国营商业部门和供销合作社又以合理的价格向农民大量收购了木材和五倍子、土烟、桐油等四十多种土产和特产，价值在二百五十亿元以上，农民的收入大为增加。为了便利农民买盐，该县国营盐业商店和许多基层供销合作社建立了代销等业务关系，同时合理调整了食盐调拨路线，由邻县的盐业商店直接把食盐运往离县城遥远的地区。从一九五二年以来，当地人民政府还拨出大批资金，修通了黎（平）榕（江）公路，修补了一百四十多条乡村道路。过去从榕江县运盐到黎平县的茅贡，每人挑七十市斤，要走四、五天，运费七万五千元；公路修通以后，只要走两天，运费减到五万元。这一切就保证了当地各族农民能吃到大量的食盐。
