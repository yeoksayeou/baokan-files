    Nature, Life, and Struggle
    ——On the Indonesian Art Exhibition
    Ni Yide
    We thank our Indonesian friends, who from the distant South, crossed the ocean, crossed the mountains and plains, to bring these precious works of art to the people of our capital in the season of early autumn in August.
    The languages of different nations need to be translated in order to be understood, but the language of visual arts does not require translation; it is an international language. We do not need to travel thousands of miles, spending weeks or months like a traveler to understand the customs and conditions of another country. After seeing the many works in this exhibition, it is as if we are wandering among the islands of Java and Sumatra, from one island to another, appreciating the tropical island scenery, and understanding the lives of the Indonesian people, their struggles, their love, and their beautiful aspirations.
    Just as Indonesian nature is rich and has distinct colors, the styles of the Indonesian painters' works are also diverse. They adopt various emphasized and exaggerated forms of expression—some are as passionate and unrestrained as a storm, others are as still as if not touched by dust, some are composed of the noisy and chaotic sounds of the city, and others are as enchanting as fairy tales and myths—to express the most representative scenes in life and nature that they keenly perceive. Therefore, each picture strongly stimulates our vision and deeply touches our hearts.
    From Nasar's "Salt Drying" and several similar landscape paintings, we can see the white salt fields undulating like hills, contrasting with the deep blue sea and sky, forming a strong contrast. The dugout canoes with their naive and simple beauty are quietly placed on the salt-laden beaches, expressing a simple and primitive seaside atmosphere. But in Trisno Sumardjo's "Port of Buleleng," a modern harbor scene is depicted, with countless light and brisk red boats tossing on the deep blue waves, creating a fresh and lively feeling. In the "Landscapes" painted by Sentot and Sudarso, we can see the lush and vibrant forests and fields, lying motionless under the hot sun. The contrast created by various primary colors has a dazzling and strong effect. In Henda's "Blue Lake" and Trisno Sumardjo's "Lake Batur," a still, dark green lake is depicted, with motionless clouds hanging in the blue sky, the colors strong and somber, like seeing the scorching sun-baked nature through tinted glasses. And in works like Haryadi's "Jojos Street Scene," the cool and moist interest after a rain shower is depicted. Kartono Yudhokusumo's "Landscape," with its enchanting colors like various gemstones inlaid together, depicts a beautiful and moving paradise of spring. The author adds imagination to the realistic description, creating a intoxicating realm of beauty.
    Mount Merapi is a famous intermittent active volcano, and many painters have depicted this rare spectacle with great interest. Hendar's "Mount Merapi" depicts the scene of the volcano erupting: flames fill the mountaintop, lava flows everywhere, scorched branches dance in the strong wind. The author uses a frantic brushstroke, and in the mostly blue and ochre dark tones, a few strokes of strong light unexpectedly appear, making the picture show a dramatic tension, giving people a feeling of an irresistible hot wind directly approaching the viewer. But in Widajat's "Mount Merapi," it is a peaceful scene after the volcanic eruption, and the surrounding scenery shows an unimaginable stillness and decorative beauty.
    Other works reflect the life and struggle of the Indonesian people. Like in Suromo's "Landscape," with bright and fresh colors, a lush green field surrounded by oak forests is depicted. In the nearby hills, a group of healthy and beautiful working women happily walk towards the fields, reflecting the Indonesian people's love for labor and life. Henk Ngantung's "Going to Market" and "Returning from Market" are group portraits with figures as the main subject. In the bright morning sun, young girls in groups of twos and threes, some walking, some sitting in donkey carts, are traveling on the country roads. The young brown-skinned girls, dressed in brightly colored clothes, with smiles on their faces, from their healthy and happy images, we can see how they love life. And in Sabar Hudoyo's "Mother and Effie" and "Mother and Child," the loveliness of children and the tenderness of mothers are delicately and vividly expressed, showing the peaceful life of the Indonesian people's families, making us deeply feel that peace is loved by people in every corner of the world, whether it is the East or the West, whether it is the mainland or the ocean.
    For the sake of independence, freedom and peace, the Indonesian people have been constantly waging a strong struggle against the Western colonialists. Works reflecting this struggle, such as Haryadi's "Three Heads," use realistic techniques to deeply depict the angry and hateful expressions of three suffering laborers who have been enslaved and tortured by colonial rulers for a long time. Kusnadi's "Two Young Guerrillas" depicts the heroic and steadfast image of two young guerrillas guarding their homeland. And Sumitro's "Self-Portrait" shows the painter himself appearing in the picture as a guerrilla.
    What particularly caught our attention was Agus Djaya's "Revolution." The author uses a strong contrast of yellow and black colors, and a cartoon-like exaggerated technique, to depict an ugly and obese white devil, swaggering through the streets on horseback, guarded and served by slaves before and after him. In the more distant places, angry revolutionaries are running wildly, shooting mercilessly at the devil. This is a passionate and struggle-filled work, which powerfully shows that in an era when the people have awakened, the bloodthirsty imperialists still want to cruelly enslave and whip the Asian people, using Asians to attack Asians; but the people have broken free from their chains, clenched their fists tightly, and are determined to drive the bloodthirsty devil out. The devil is reaching the moment of its doom.
    We have long known and expressed our infinite respect for the Indonesian people's love for peace and their great spirit of fighting for independence and peace; the concrete and vivid expression of these oil paintings further deepens our understanding. It further shortens the geographical distance between us and further strengthens the unity and friendship between the peoples of the two countries. The artist's efforts to use canvas and color for the happiness of the people and for the cause of world peace have already exerted its great power, and this power will surely be further expanded and developed in the future.

    自然、生活和斗争
    ——记印度尼西亚艺术展览会
    倪贻德
    感谢印度尼西亚的朋友们，从遥远的南方，越过了海洋，越过了山岭和平原，在八月新秋的季节，给我国首都的人民带来了这许多珍贵的艺术品。
    不同民族的语言是需要经过翻译才能懂得，而造型美术的语言却不需要翻译，这是一种国际性的语言。我们不必像一个游历者那样需要跋涉千里、花上几个星期或几个月的时间去了解另一个国家的风土人情，看了这个展览会里的许多作品，正好像漫游在爪哇和苏门答腊的群岛之间，从这一个岛到那一个岛，欣赏了热带海洋的岛国风光，了解了印度尼西亚人民的生活、他们的斗争、他们的爱和美好的想望。
    正像印度尼西亚的自然那样的丰富、那样地具有鲜明的色彩，印度尼西亚的画家们作品上的风格也是多种多样的，他们采取了各色各样的强调的夸张的表现形式——有的像暴风雨般的热烈奔放，有的又是纤尘不动般地静止，有的像用了都市中繁嚣杂乱的噪音所组成，有的又像童话和神话般的魅惑——来表现他们敏锐地感受到的生活和自然中的最富有代表性的场景，因而使每一幅画面，强烈地刺激了我们的视觉，深深地打动了我们的心坎。
    从那萨的“晒盐”以及和这类似的几幅风景画上，我们可以看到像小丘般连绵起伏的白色的盐田，衬托着深蓝的海和天空，形成强烈的对比；具有稚拙的造型美的独木舟，静静地搁在堆积了盐的沙滩上，表现了单纯而原始的海边的情调。但在特利斯诺·苏马底约的“布勒伦港”上，却描写了近代化的海港风光，无数轻快的红色小艇，簸荡在深碧的海波上，具有清新明快的感觉。在森托得和苏达尔索等所画的“风景”上，可以看到那样丰茂而郁勃的树林和田野，一动也不动地躺在炎热的阳光下，那种由各种原色所组成的对比，有令人炫目的强烈的效果。在汉达立渥的“蓝湖”和特利斯诺·苏马底约的“巴都尔湖”这些作品上，描写了一片静止的浓绿的湖水，蓝天中停留着不动的云，色彩强烈而又沉暗，像带了墨晶眼镜所看到的灼热炎天下的自然。而像赫雅底的“裘司雅街景”那样的作品上，却又描写出了阵雨后的清凉润湿的情趣。卡托诺·尤多库苏摩的“风景”，以像用各种彩宝石所镶嵌起来的诱人的色彩，描写了美丽动人的春的乐园，作者在现实的描写上加入想像的成分，创造了令人陶醉的美的境界。
    麦拉比火山是闻名的间歇性的活火山，不少画家以极大的兴趣来描写了这世界罕有的奇观。汉得拉的“麦拉比火山”是描写了火山正在爆发时的一刻的情景：火焰弥漫在山头，溶岩在到处奔流，被灼焦了的树枝在疾风中飞舞，作者以狂乱的笔调，在极大部分的青与赭的暗色调中不期而显出几笔强光的明色，使画面现出了戏剧性的紧张，使人感到有一种不可阻遏的热风向观者直逼而来。但在维达雅特所描写的“麦拉比火山”，却是火山喷息后的平静的情景，周围的景色显出了不可想像的静止的装饰美。
    在另一些作品上反映了印度尼西亚人民的生活和斗争。像在苏罗摩的“风景”上，以明快清新的色调，描写了被围绕在橡树林中间的一片葱绿的田野，在近处的高岗上，一群健康美丽的劳动妇女愉快地走向田间，反映了印度尼西亚人民热爱劳动和生活的景象。汉克·昂东的“上市场”和“从市场归来”，是以人物为主体的群像构图，在早晨明艳的阳光下，年青的少女三三两两，有的步行，有的坐在驴车上，在乡间的大道上行进，年青的棕色皮肤的少女们，穿了各色鲜艳夺目的衣服，脸上露着微笑，从那健康而愉快的形象上，可以看出她们如何热爱生活的心情。而在沙布多胡多约的“母亲和艾菲”“母与子”这些作品上，细腻而生动地表现出儿童的可爱和母亲的柔情，表现出了印度尼西亚人民的家庭中的和平生活，使我们深深地感觉到，和平是世界上每一个角落的人民所热爱的，不论东方和西方，不论大陆和海洋。
    为了独立、自由与和平，印度尼西亚的人民曾不断地对西方的殖民者作着坚强的斗争，反映了这种斗争的作品，如赫雅底的“三人头像”，是用写实的技法，深刻地刻划出长时期被殖民统治者所奴役折磨的三个苦难的劳动人民的愤怒而仇恨的表情。库斯纳底的“两个年轻游击队员”，是描写守望在他们祖国原野上的两个年轻的游击队员英勇坚强的形象。而苏米特罗的“自画像”，画家本人就以游击队员的姿态出现在画面上。
    特别引起我们注意的是阿古斯·佳雅的“革命”，作者以黄与黑的强烈对比的色彩，漫画般的夸张的手法，描写了一个丑恶肥大的白色魔鬼，正骑了马大摇大摆地在街头巡行，前后有奴隶们的护卫与侍候，在较远的地方，愤怒的革命者在狂奔而来，向魔鬼作无情的射击。这是一幅热情洋溢、充满着斗争性的作品，它有力地表示了：嗜血的帝国主义者，在人民觉醒了的时代，还想残酷地奴役和鞭打亚洲人民，以亚洲人攻打亚洲人；但人民已经挣脱了锁链，紧紧地握起拳头，决心把嗜血的魔鬼驱逐出去了，魔鬼正到了末日来临的时刻。
    印度尼西亚人民的这种热爱和平，这种为独立与和平而斗争的伟大心情，我们是早就知道并表示无限敬意的；通过这些油画作品的具体生动的表现，更使我们得到深一层的了解。它更缩短了我们之间的地理上的距离，更增强了两国人民的团结友好。艺术家用了画布和彩色，为了人民的幸福、为了世界和平的事业所作的努力，已经发挥了它的巨大力量，而这种力量今后一定会更加扩大和发展起来。
