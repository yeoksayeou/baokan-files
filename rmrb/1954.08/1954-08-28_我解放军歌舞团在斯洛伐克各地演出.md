Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe arrived in Martin, their last city to visit in Slovakia, on the 23rd. The troupe's arrival coincided with the Slovak people's celebration of the tenth anniversary of their armed uprising against the Nazi German occupation. That evening at 6 o'clock, they performed for an audience of 50,000, with the people of Martin treating the performance as the beginning of their celebration activities for the tenth anniversary of the armed uprising.
    From noon on the 23rd, all streets in Martin leading to the open-air theater were filled with spectators from all over the state. Before the song and dance troupe's performance, an aircraft dropped a beautiful wreath into the theater by parachute. At the same time, doves of peace were released around the stands of the theater. When the song and dance troupe finished their performance, fireworks appeared in the sky above the theater, and the audience burst into prolonged cheers, welcoming the representatives of the Chinese people and thanking them for their performance.
    Before arriving in Martin, the song and dance troupe had taken a four-day break in the High Tatras, the most beautiful scenic area in Czechoslovakia, starting on the 19th. On the 21st, the song and dance troupe performed in the mountainous area of Stav-Smokovec. The residents of this area held a dedication ceremony for a monument to martyrs to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Slovak people's armed uprising. The song and dance troupe's performance brought this celebration to a climax. Among the more than 15,000 spectators, many were working people recuperating in the mountains and patients from sanatoriums.
    On the last day of the song and dance troupe's rest in the mountains—the 22nd—they were invited jointly by the people of Spišská Nová Ves, Levoča, and Gelnica in the Košice region, to perform for the people of the three cities in Spišská Nová Ves. Spišská Nová Ves is one of the oldest cities in Slovakia, with a history of 880 years. However, it was the first time for the citizens to see a Chinese people's song and dance troupe and hear foreign friends sing Slovak songs. After the song and dance troupe's performance, the People's Committee of Spišská Nová Ves, in order to commemorate this meaningful meeting between the people of the city and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, decided to name the city's largest street "Chinese People's Liberation Army Street" and planned to build this street into the most beautiful street in the city, as a symbol of further developing the fighting friendship between the people and armies of China and Czechoslovakia.

    我解放军歌舞团在斯洛伐克各地演出
    据新华社讯：中国人民解放军歌舞团二十三日到达了他们访问斯洛伐克的最后一个城市马丁市。歌舞团的到达正是斯洛伐克人民要庆祝他们举行反对希特勒德国占领者的武装起义十周年纪念的时候。当晚六时，他们向五万观众作了演出，马丁市的人民就把这次演出作为他们庆祝武装起义十周年的活动的开始。
    从二十三日正午起，马丁市一切通往露天剧场的街道就挤满了来自本州各地的观众。在歌舞团演出之前，一架飞机用降落伞向剧场投下一个美丽的花圈，同时，剧场的看台四周放出了和平鸽。歌舞团演出终场时，剧场上空出现了焰火，全场响起了经久不息的欢呼声，欢迎中国人民的代表，并感谢他们的演出。
    歌舞团在到达马丁市前，曾在十九日到捷克斯洛伐克最美丽的风景区高塔特拉山作四天休息。二十一日，歌舞团在山区斯塔夫—斯摩科维茨演出。这个地方的居民为庆祝斯洛伐克人民武装起义十周年，举行烈士纪念碑揭幕礼。歌舞团的演出使这次庆祝活动达到了高潮。在一万五千多个观众当中，有不少是在山区休养的劳动人民和疗养院的病人。
    歌舞团在山区休息的最后一天——二十二日，又应科息斯州的斯皮斯卡—诺瓦维斯，勒沃查和格尔尼查三市人民的联名邀请，在斯皮斯卡—诺瓦维斯市为三地人民演出。斯皮斯卡—诺瓦维斯是斯洛伐克最古老的城市之一，已有八百八十年的历史。但市民们看到中国人民的歌舞团体、听见外国朋友唱斯洛伐克歌曲，这还是第一次。歌舞团演出后，斯皮斯卡—诺瓦维斯市人民委员会，为了纪念本市人民和中国人民解放军歌舞团这次有意义的会见，决定以这个城市最大的一条街命名为“中国人民解放军街”，并准备把这条街道建设成全市最美丽的街道，作为进一步发展中捷两国人民及其军队之间的战斗友谊的标志。
