    The First Congress of the Communist Party of China Gansu Provincial Congress was held in Lanzhou from August 2nd to August 11th. A total of 643 representatives attended the meeting. Because Ningxia Province will be merged with Gansu Province to form Gansu Province, representatives from the former Ningxia Province also attended the meeting.
    Based on the Party's general line during the transition period and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, the meeting, on the basis of fully promoting democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, reviewed and summarized the work of Gansu Province over the past five years, and discussed and determined the tasks for the future. The meeting held that: under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Northwest Bureau, and relying on the concerted efforts of all Party members, cadres, and people of all ethnic groups and sectors in the province, the previous Gansu Provincial Committee had achieved great results in all aspects of work over the past five years, creating favorable conditions for further socialist construction and socialist transformation.
    The meeting discussed and determined the tasks of the Party in the Gansu region and the issue of Party building for the next two years. Regarding the work in the future, the meeting proposed four main tasks: First, strengthen the leadership of industrial construction. According to the national construction plan, Gansu Province will establish a number of large-scale modern factories and mines, and expand existing state-owned industries, in particular to build Yumen Oilfield into China's first petroleum base. In order to create conditions for industrial construction, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is being actively built; the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway and a number of highways will also soon begin construction, which will rapidly make Gansu one of China's new industrial bases. The task of the Party is to strive to ensure the completion of these tasks. The Provincial Party Committee should quickly shift the focus of leadership to industrial construction and actively learn to manage industry and urban construction. Second, carry out an agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, and gradually carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, producing more grain, oil and other industrial raw materials to meet the needs of industrial construction. Because Gansu has old revolutionary areas, mountainous areas, ethnic minority areas and arid areas, the situation is extremely complex, therefore, in carrying out the above work, special emphasis should be placed on adapting to local conditions based on the different characteristics of each region. Third, actively develop socialist commerce, strengthen market management, and gradually implement the socialist transformation of capitalist commerce. Fourth, earnestly do a good job in ethnic work and united front work. Gansu is a province with many ethnic groups, and the Party and the People's Government must continue to implement the Party's ethnic policy, adhere to the principle of prudence and steadiness, and vigorously carry out economic and cultural work under the principle of strengthening ethnic unity. In agricultural areas, pastoral areas, and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, planned, step-by-step and prudent methods should be adopted to carry out work in accordance with the Party's ethnic policies, based on the characteristics of the region and ethnic groups. The training, training and promotion of ethnic minority cadres must continue to be strengthened in the future, and attention should be paid to absorbing outstanding activists discovered and cultivated from the masses into the Party and the League.
    The meeting held that: in order to ensure the victorious completion of the above work tasks, the key lies in strengthening the Party's organizational construction and ideological construction. In the future, we must resolutely implement the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, further enhance the Party's unity, improve the committee system, strengthen collective leadership, strengthen the ideological cultivation of Party members, and improve the communist consciousness of Party members; in order to strengthen the Party's organizational construction, in the future, we must actively expand the Party's organization, strengthen the leadership of branch work, and vigorously cultivate and select cadres; in order to strengthen the Party's ideological construction, in the future, we must strengthen Marxism-Leninism education and improve the theoretical and policy level of Party members and cadres; in order to improve the Party's leadership methods and leadership style, in the future, we must strengthen investigation and research work.
    After repeated deliberations and discussions, the meeting elected Zhang Zhongliang, Huo Weide, Li Jinglin and 38 others to form the new CPC Gansu Provincial Committee. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中共甘肃省第一次代表大会会议在兰州举行
    中国共产党甘肃省第一次代表大会会议于八月二日到八月十一日在兰州市举行。出席会议的代表共六百四十三人。因为宁夏省将和甘肃省合并为甘肃省，原宁夏省的代表也出席了这次会议。
    会议根据党在过渡时期的总路线和党的七届四中全会的精神，在充分发扬民主、开展批评和自我批评的基础上，检查和总结了甘肃省将近五年来的工作，讨论确定了今后的工作任务。会议认为：前届甘肃省委在党中央和西北局领导下，依靠全体党员、干部和全省各族各界人民的一致努力，将近五年来各项工作都获得了巨大成绩，为进一步进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造创造了有利条件。
    会议讨论确定了今后两年党在甘肃地区的任务和党的建设问题。关于今后的工作，会议提出四项主要任务：第一，加强对工业建设的领导。依照国家的建设计划，甘肃省将要建立若干规模巨大的现代化厂矿，并扩大现有国营工业，特别是要把玉门油矿建设成为我国第一个石油基地。为了给工业建设创造条件，正在积极修筑兰新铁路；包（头）兰（州）铁路以及若干条公路，也都即将开始修筑，这些都将使甘肃迅速成为我国新的工业基地之一。党的任务就是要努力保证这些任务的完成。省委应将领导重点迅速转到工业建设方面来，积极学会管理工业和城市建设。第二，开展以互助合作为中心的农业生产运动，逐步进行对农业的社会主义改造，生产更多的粮食、油料和其他工业原料，以适应工业建设的需要。因为甘肃有老区、山区、少数民族地区和干旱地区，情况极其复杂，因此，在进行上述工作时，要特别强调根据各地的不同特点，因地制宜。第三，积极发展社会主义商业，加强市场管理，逐步实行对资本主义商业的社会主义改造。第四，切实做好民族工作和统一战线工作。甘肃是一个多民族的省份，党和人民政府必须继续贯彻党的民族政策，坚持慎重稳进方针，在加强民族团结的原则下，大力进行经济和文化工作。在农业区和牧区、半农半牧区，都应采取有计划、有步骤的稳妥办法，按照党的民族政策，根据地区和民族特点进行工作。对少数民族干部的培养、训练和提拔，今后必须继续加强，注意吸收从群众中发现和培养出来的优秀积极分子入党入团。
    会议认为：为了保证以上工作任务的胜利完成，关键在于加强党的组织建设和思想建设。今后必须坚决贯彻党的七届四中全会的决议，进一步增强党的团结，健全党委制，加强集体领导，加强党员的思想修养，提高党员的共产主义觉悟；为了加强党的组织建设工作，今后必须积极扩大党的组织，加强支部工作的领导，大力培养和选拔干部；为了加强党的思想建设，今后必须加强马克思列宁主义教育，提高党员干部的理论政策水平；为了改善党的领导方法和领导作风，今后必须加强调查研究工作。
    会上经过反复酝酿讨论，选出了张仲良、霍维德、李景林等四十一人，组成了新的中共甘肃省委员会。　　　　（新华社）
