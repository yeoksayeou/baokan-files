Also present were: Ton Quang Phiet, member of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Father Vu Xuan Ky, member of the Vietnam National United Front.

Also present were: Ho Viet Thang, member of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and Duong Duc Hien, Secretary-General of the Vietnam Democratic Party.

Also present was: Hoang Van Thai, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army.

Also present were: Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, Nguyen Cong Hoa, representative of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, Phan Thi An, representative of the Vietnam Women's Union, and Nguyen Xuan Khanh, representative of the Vietnam Youth League.

Also present were: Chu Van Tan, Chairman of the Viet Bac Interzone Resistance Administrative Committee, and Le Ngoc Son, Chairman of the Thai Nguyen Province Resistance Administrative Committee.

After the meeting began, Minister of Finance Le Van Hien delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He paid tribute to the delegation and said that despite the complex and intense struggles at the Geneva Conference, the delegation had completed the important tasks entrusted by President Ho Chi Minh and the government and achieved victory.

Ho Viet Thang, member of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, delivered a speech on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party. He pointed out that peace had been restored, and the agreement on the cessation of hostilities had begun to be implemented. There are still many difficulties on the road to implementing the agreement, but we will certainly be able to overcome them in order to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete the independence and democracy of the country. The Vietnam Workers' Party will resolutely lead the people to complete the three major tasks and various specific tasks put forward by President Ho Chi Minh in order to implement the agreement on the cessation of hostilities, achieve general elections, and prepare for the construction of the motherland.

Hoang Van Thai, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army, said in his speech: Today, peace has been restored in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The task of the Vietnam People's Army is to implement the agreement on the cessation of hostilities and consolidate peace as correctly as carrying out combat missions. He guaranteed to implement the agreement on the cessation of hostilities resolutely and thoroughly, while constantly increasing vigilance and guarding against all schemes of warmongers to sabotage peace.

Speeches were also delivered at the welcome meeting by Ton Quang Phiet, Vu Xuan Ky, Le Dinh Tham, Chu Van Tan, Duong Duc Hien, and others. They all unanimously praised the achievements made by the delegation, expressed their gratitude for the strong support of the Soviet and Chinese delegations, and expressed their willingness to contribute their strength to the struggle to consolidate peace in the future, to continue to ease international tensions, and to defend the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

Finally, Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong spoke. After explaining in detail the achievements of the Geneva Conference in all aspects and the important reasons for these achievements, he said: Today, the common task of the Vietnamese people is to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete the independence and democracy of the country. He said: The Vietnamese people must faithfully, thoroughly, and fully fulfill the agreements signed. The parties concerned should also faithfully, thoroughly, and fully fulfill the agreements. He pointed out that all the Vietnamese people from the South to the North must actively strive to achieve national unification through general elections.

Pham Van Dong then talked about relations with France and Southeast Asian countries. He said: The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is willing to establish economic and cultural relations with France on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam needs to expand its relations with Southeast Asian countries in accordance with the principles put forward in the joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Burma.

He talked about the extremely grand and cordial reception the delegation received from the governments and peoples of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and China during their return trip. He said that this enthusiastic support has increased the new strength of the Vietnamese people.

Finally, Pham Van Dong protested against the Ngo Dinh Diem group's act of hijacking North Vietnamese people in violation of the agreement. He said that currently, the Ngo Dinh Diem group is resorting to any means to force people to follow them in their retreat. This is an action that violates the provisions of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities. The agreement explicitly stipulates that people are completely free to choose the area in which they wish to reside and must be assisted in realizing their wishes. This action is part of the conspiracy of American interventionists, French warmongers, and their lackeys to obstruct the implementation of the agreements that have been signed. He emphasized that the Vietnamese people strongly oppose and will resolutely fight against this action, and be ready to crush all sabotage conspiracies at any time.

    【新华社北越十二日电】越南民主共和国各界代表和太原省、太原市的工人、农民、部队、学生等一万五千人，十一日在太原市举行盛大集会，欢迎以副总理兼代理外交部部长范文同为首的越南民主共和国出席日内瓦会议代表团归来。
    到会的有：外交部部长黄明鉴，财政部部长黎文献，财政部副部长郑文炳，劳动部部长阮文造，交通部副部长黎容，工商部副部长邓曰州，总理府秘书长胡辉静，国家银行总行长黎曰亮。
    到会的还有：越南民主共和国国民大会常务委员会委员孙光阀，越南国民联合战线委员武春纪神甫。
    到会的还有：越南劳动党中央委员胡曰胜，越南民主党总书记杨德贤。
    到会的还有：越南人民军副总参谋长黄文泰。
    到会的还有：越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎廷探，越南总工会代表阮功和，越南妇女联合会代表潘氏安，越南青年联盟代表阮春簪。
    到会的还有：越北联区抗战行政委员会主席朱文晋，太原省抗战行政委员会主席黎玉孙。
    会议开始后，财政部部长黎文献代表越南民主共和国政府致欢迎词。他向代表团致敬并且说，尽管在日内瓦会议上的斗争是复杂的、剧烈的，代表团已经完成了胡志明主席和政府所托付的重大任务，取得了胜利。
    越南劳动党中央委员胡曰胜代表越南劳动党中央委员会致词。他指出，和平已经恢复，停止敌对行动协定开始实现，在实现协定的道路上还有许多困难，但我们一定能够克服困难，以巩固和平、实现统一，完成国家的独立和民主。越南劳动党将坚决领导人民完成胡志明主席提出的三大任务和各项具体工作，以实现停止敌对行动协定、实现普选和准备建设祖国。
    越南人民军副总参谋长黄文泰致词说：今天，已经在越南、柬埔寨和老挝恢复了和平。越南人民军的任务是同执行战斗任务一样正确地执行停止敌对行动协定和巩固和平。他保证坚决地、彻底地执行停止敌对行动协定，同时，不断地提高警惕，提防好战分子的一切破坏和平的阴谋。
    在欢迎会上致词的还有孙光阀、武春纪、黎廷探、朱文晋、杨德贤等。他们都一致赞扬代表团所取得的成就，对苏联和中国代表团的有力支持表示感谢，并表示在今后巩固和平的斗争中，在继续缓和国际紧张局势和保卫亚洲及世界和平的事业中贡献出自己的力量。
    最后，范文同副总理讲话。他在详尽地说明了日内瓦会议各方面的成就和取得这些成就的重要原因之后说：今天，越南人民的共同任务是巩固和平、实现统一、完成国家的独立和民主。他说：越南人民要忠实地、彻底地、充分地履行所签订的协定。有关的各方也应该忠实地、彻底地、充分地履行协定。他指出，从南部到北部的全体越南人民要为经过普选的途径来实现国家的统一而积极斗争。
    范文同接着谈到同法国和东南亚国家的关系。他说：越南民主共和国愿意在平等、互利的基础上同法国建立经济和文化关系。越南民主共和国需要按照中印、中缅总理的联合声明中所提出的原则扩大同东南亚各国的关系。
    他谈到代表团在归国途中受到德意志民主共和国、苏联、中国的政府和人民极其隆重和亲切的招待。他说，这些热情的支持使越南人民增加了新的力量。
    最后，范文同抗议吴庭艳集团劫运北越人民的违反协议的行为。他说，目前吴庭艳集团正不惜采取任何手段强迫人民跟随他们撤退。这是违反停止敌对行动协定规定的行动。协定曾明文规定人民完全自由地选择他们所愿意居住的地区，并要协助人民实现自己的意愿。这种行动是美国干涉者、法国战争贩子及其走狗的企图阻挠履行已签订的协定的阴谋中的一部分。他着重指出：越南人民强烈反对并要坚决对这种行动进行斗争，随时粉碎一切破坏阴谋。
