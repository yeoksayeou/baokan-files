The Xionxiang No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Second District of Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, in its early days, lacked experience in management and its labor force was poorly organized. Every day, everyone started and finished work together. More than thirty cooperative members asked the cooperative director for work every day, frequently resulting in wasted labor. The cooperative director didn't know how to lead effectively. In particular, labor calculation was still done in the same way as in the mutual aid team, using an hourly wage system, regardless of the strength of the labor force. As long as someone worked eight hours a day, they were counted as ten points. The cooperative members' enthusiasm for labor was not high; everyone felt they had completed their task by working eight hours a day. When carrying mud, if you carried one load, I carried one load too, not less and not more than you. Women all used the excuse of having many children to avoid working.

The cooperative cadres studied this situation and decided to change to a "fixed base score with flexible evaluation" method, setting a base score for each person and evaluating it flexibly every three days. After this change, coupled with mobilization and explanation, everyone became more motivated, and two women also went to the fields to participate in labor.

Three days later, the scores were evaluated. The base scores were there, but how to evaluate them flexibly? Everyone had their own opinions. In the end, after the evaluation, some people were still not satisfied. Everyone studied it again and felt that three days was too long for one evaluation, and that people were not working together every day, so they did not understand each other. Therefore, it was decided to change to daily evaluation and divide the cooperative members into three temporary production teams. But after one day of work, opinions came up again. The reason was that some groups evaluated loosely, while others evaluated strictly, and there was no unified standard.

The management committee compared and studied several methods to see which one was better. Everyone felt that the flexible evaluation in the "fixed base score with flexible evaluation" method was difficult because the types of work were different, some were light and some were heavy, and it was difficult to compare them with each other. Moreover, the groups did not understand each other, so some groups were loose and some were tight, and it was difficult to be consistent. Piecework avoided these problems, and the mutual aid team had also tried this method in the past. Therefore, it was decided to adopt a method of piecework combined with fixed base score and flexible evaluation. When it was first implemented, the scores between various jobs were not balanced, but after several summaries and studies, it was gradually resolved.

In order to do a good job in piecework, they developed a set of methods, mainly including specific production arrangements, piece-rate scoring, group contracting, and designated personnel responsibility.

Specific production arrangements mean arranging small segments of production specifically according to the requirements of the cooperative's annual production increase plan. For example, in spring plowing and production, the work before transplanting seedlings is arranged in order of urgency. Piece-rate scoring means that the work that has been arranged is classified and evaluated according to how much each ordinary laborer can do, with reference to its lightness, heaviness, and difficulty, and a base score is determined. Group contracting means dividing the cooperative's land into three plots according to the principle of facilitating work, calculating the number of workdays required for each plot before transplanting seedlings, and then dividing them into three temporary production teams according to work needs and the cooperative members' strength, technical skills, and other conditions. Each group contracts for one plot, and under the leadership of the management committee and the team leader, a work schedule is set according to the requirements of the cooperative's plan. Small division of labor and small contracting can also be appropriately carried out within the group. If a few people do this task, the work points are discussed and distributed by these few people, passed by the group, and each person records them in their work point ledger. The team leader collects the work point ledgers and sends them to the cooperative for scoring. Designated personnel responsibility is used to supplement the shortcomings of group contracting. For example, finding fertilizer sources and soaking grain seeds are all assigned to designated personnel. In addition, some tasks that cannot be scored by the piece are still handled using the method of fixed base score and flexible evaluation.

After this method was implemented, the cooperative's production plan was specifically arranged, the labor organization was relatively sound, and the cooperative members no longer asked the cooperative director for work every day. The evaluation was fast, good, and reasonable, and everyone was very satisfied. The cooperative members' enthusiasm for production has also greatly increased. They go to the fields before dawn every day, and after weeding, they automatically repair the dikes or carry river mud to fill in the water puddles in the fields. In the past, women rarely went to the fields, but now they all participate in field labor, and some women do it even faster than men. This has greatly strengthened the cooperative members' confidence in running the agricultural production cooperative well, and the superiority of the agricultural production cooperative has been further demonstrated.

    雄乡第一农业生产合作社分组包工的经过
    广东省新会县第二区雄乡第一农业生产合作社建成初期，由于缺乏经营管理的经验，劳动力组织得不好。每天大家一齐做工一齐收工，三十多个社员天天问社主任要工做，经常发生浪费劳动力的现象，社主任也不知要怎样领导才好。特别是劳动力计算还像过去在互助组时一样，采用按时计工办法，不论劳动力强弱，只要一天做八小时工作便算十分。社员的劳动积极性不高，大家每天去做八小时工便算完成任务。担泥时你担一担我也担一担，不比你少也不比你多，妇女都推说孩子多不去做工。
    社干部研究了这个情况，决定改用死分活评办法，各人定底分，三天活评一次。这样改了，加上动员解释，大家劲头大了一些，有两个妇女也下田参加劳动了。
    三天后，评分了。底分是有了，可是怎样活评呢？各有各的意见，最后评出来了，还是有人不满意。大家再行研究，认为三天评一次时间太长，各人又不是天天在一起做工，互不了解，于是决定改为天天评工，并把社员分成三个临时生产小组。可是做了一天，意见又来了。原因是有的组评的松，有的组评的紧，没有统一的标准。
    管理委员会拿几种办法来比较研究，看那一种好。大家觉得死分活评中的活评困难，因为工作种类不一，有轻有重，彼此很难比较，而且组与组间又互不了解，评起来有的组松，有的组紧，很难一致；按件包工就没有这些毛病，而且过去互助组也曾试行过这个办法。于是决定了采用以按件包工为主结合死分活评的办法。刚实行时各种工作之间的分数定得不平衡，但是经过几次总结研究以后，就逐步解决了。
    为了把按件包工做好，他们订出了一套办法，主要是具体安排生产、按件计分、小组包工和专人负责。
    具体安排生产就是按照社的全年增产计划的要求，具体安排小段的生产，如在春耕生产中，就先把插秧前的工作按照缓急先后逐件排好。按件计分就是把这些排列出来的工作，根据每个普通劳动力能做多少，参照其轻重难易，分类评出底分。小组包工就是把全社土地根据做工便利的原则划分为三个片，把每片插秧前所需工数算出，再按工作需要与社员的劳动力强弱、技术高低等条件搭配分成三个临时生产小组，每组各包一片，同时在管理委员和组长领导下按照全社计划的要求，定出工作日程。小组内又可适当进行小分工、小包工，那几个人做了这一件工作，工分即由这几个人评议分配，在小组通过，各人记在自己的记工簿上，由组长集中记工簿到社里记分。专人负责是用以辅小组包工之不足的。如找肥源、浸谷种等都找出专人负责。此外有些不能按件计分的，则仍用死分活评办法。
    实行了这个办法以后，全社的生产计划有了具体的安排，劳动组织也比较健全了，社员也不天天问社主任要工做了。评工时评得又快又好又合理，大家都很满意。社员生产积极性也大大提高了，每天天不亮就下田，锄完田后就自动地去修补围堤或担河泥把田里的水凼填平。妇女过去很少下田，现在也都参加田间劳动了，而且有些妇女比男人做得还快。这样大大地加强了社员们办好农业生产合作社的信心，农业生产合作社的优越性也进一步显示出来了。　（原载南方日报）
