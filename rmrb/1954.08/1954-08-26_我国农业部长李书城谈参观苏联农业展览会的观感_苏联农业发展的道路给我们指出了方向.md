(Our Correspondent Li He Reports from Moscow) The Chinese delegation visiting the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, led by Minister of Agriculture Li Shucheng, spent three weeks visiting and studying at the exhibition and visited rural areas near Moscow, receiving warm hospitality from the Soviet government and people everywhere. Before departing for a visit to the bountiful Kuban on the 25th, Minister Li Shucheng shared the delegation's impressions of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition with the reporter:

The Soviet Agricultural Exhibition is extraordinarily rich. We regard it as a valuable school for learning production knowledge and advanced experiences. Every day we plunged into each exhibition hall, feeling that there was too much to learn and that darkness came too quickly. The Soviet experience of agricultural collectivization and mechanization is very precious for our country's vigorously developing agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement and the agricultural technology reform movement that is underway.

In the exhibition, we first saw the superiority of the socialist agricultural system. Soviet collective farms and state farms are equipped with modern agricultural science and technology, so their production and commodity rates have developed to a high level. In 1926-1927, before the complete collectivization in the Soviet Union, commodity grains were only 10.3 million tons, commodity potatoes were only 3 million tons, commodity meat (live weight) was only 2.4 million tons, and commodity milk was only 4.3 million tons; by 1950-1951, commodity grains had increased to 40.04 million tons, commodity potatoes had increased to 12.5 million tons, commodity meat (live weight) had increased to 5 million tons, and commodity milk had increased to 13.2 million tons. This increase in commodity agricultural products plays a huge role in meeting the growing needs of industry and people's lives. Our country is carrying out large-scale industrial construction, and the state requires agriculture to adapt to the development of industry, rapidly develop agriculture, and increase the commodity rate of agricultural products, especially the commodity rate of grain and cotton. The path of Soviet agricultural development points us in a clear direction. In the exhibition, the brilliant achievements of Soviet agricultural science also left a deep impression on us. The most important of these is the widespread application of mechanization. In order to adapt to different soil qualities and different crops in different regions, the Soviet Union invented and created thousands of various agricultural and animal husbandry machines and tools. From plowing, sowing, cultivating, fertilizing, harvesting, and threshing, to preparing feed, milking, and shearing, from reclaiming wasteland to paddy field farming, all kinds of machines are available. And machine tractor stations are all over the country, which is a decisive factor in expanding the cultivated area and increasing the yield per unit area. This year, the planned reclamation of wasteland was 13 million hectares, but 14 million hectares were reclaimed in five months.

The Soviet experience in deep plowing in different soils is very important for our country, which has many different soils. Some soils in the Soviet Union need to be deep-plowed every year, while others only need to be deep-plowed once every four years. Maltsev's new tillage method mainly involves deep plowing once every four years. We also attach great importance to the knowledge and experience of washing saline soil, draining low-lying land, and solving the problem of water sources in arid areas. Because our country has more coastal areas and more paddy fields, washing saline and draining water are important tasks. In particular, the reclamation of raw and uncultivated wasteland is mostly in low-lying or water-deficient areas. The former must do a good job of drainage, and the latter must solve the problem of water sources and maintain soil moisture.

We spent a lot of time studying the experience of cultivating and caring for various crops. For example, square cluster planting and cultivating seedlings in peat humus nutrient dishes contribute greatly to increasing livestock production and saving labor. Other outstanding achievements, such as crop selection and livestock breeding, have aroused our great interest.

In the exhibition, we deeply felt the tremendous efforts made by the Soviet people in implementing the policies of the Party and the government, especially the decisions of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee last year and the February and March Plenary Sessions this year. We saw the rapid development of all sectors of Soviet agriculture in the past year and the strong support of Soviet industry for agriculture. We also saw and heard about the numerous advanced workers and socialist labor heroes in various sectors of agriculture who emerged in selfless labor. Their deeds are worth learning from.

    我国农业部长李书城谈参观苏联农业展览会的观感
    苏联农业发展的道路给我们指出了方向
    本报记者李何自莫斯科报道：我国参观苏联农业展览会代表团，由农业部部长李书城率领，在展览会进行了三星期的参观和学习，并且访问了莫斯科附近的农村，到处受到苏联政府和人民的热情款待。代表团于二十五日出发访问丰收的库班。行前，李书城部长向记者发表了代表团对苏联农业展览会的观感如下：
    苏联农业展览会是异常丰富的。我们把它当成学习生产知识和先进经验的宝贵的学校。每天我们投到每一个展览馆中去，感到应学习的太多，觉得天黑得太快。苏联农业集体化机械化的经验，对于我国正在蓬勃发展着的农业互助合作运动和进行着的农业技术改革运动是非常珍贵的。
    在展览会中，我们首先看到社会主义农业制度的优越性。苏联集体农庄和国营农场是以现代农业科学技术装备起来的，所以它们的生产和商品率都发展到高度水平。在苏联还没有全盘集体化的一九二六——一九二七年，商品谷物只有一千零三十万吨，商品马铃薯只有三百万吨，商品肉类（活重）只有二百四十万吨，商品牛乳只有四百三十万吨；到一九五○——一九五一年，商品谷物增加到四千零四百万吨，商品马铃薯增加到一千二百五十万吨，商品肉类（活重）增加到五百万吨，商品牛乳增加到一千三百二十万吨。这种商品农产品的增加，对于满足工业和人民生活日益增长着的需要，起着巨大作用。我国正在进行大规模的工业建设，国家要求农业要适应工业的发展，迅速发展农业，提高农产品的商品率，特别是粮、棉的商品率。苏联农业发展的道路，给我们指出了明确的方向。在展览会中，苏联农业科学的辉煌成就，给我们的印象也是深刻的。其中最重要的是机械化的普遍应用。为了适应各个不同地区的不同土质不同作物，苏联发明创造了成千种各式各样的农业和牧畜业的机器和工具。从耕地、播种、中耕、施肥、收获、脱谷，到调制饲料、挤乳、剪毛，从开垦荒地到水田农作，各种机器应有尽有。而机器拖拉机站遍布全国，这是扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量的决定因素。今年开垦荒地，原计划为一千三百万公顷，但在五个月中就开垦了一千四百万公顷。
    苏联在不同土壤中进行深耕的经验，对于我们有多种不同土壤的国家，非常重要。苏联有的土壤需要逐年深耕，而有的土壤只要四年深耕一次。马尔采夫的新耕作方法，主要内容就是四年深耕一次。我们也很重视咸地洗咸、洼地排水和解决干旱地带的水源问题的知识和经验。因为我国沿海地区较多，水田较多，洗咸排水是重要工作。尤其开垦生熟荒地多在低洼或缺水地区，前者须做好排水工作，后者又须解决水源及保持土壤水分问题。
    我们用了较多时间研究了各种作物的栽培照料的经验。例如方形簇种和以泥炭腐植质营养皿培植秧苗，对于提高畜产量以及节省劳力，贡献很大。其他如作物的选种，牲畜的饲养等等的出色成就，都引起我们巨大的兴趣。
    在展览会中，我们深刻感觉到苏联人民在实现党和政府的政策尤其是苏共中央去年九月全会和今年二、三月全会的决定上所作的巨大努力。我们看到了苏联农业各部门这一年来突飞猛进的发展，和苏联工业对农业的强大支援。我们也看到了和听到了在忘我的劳动中涌现的农业各部门众多的先进工作者和社会主义劳动英雄。他们的事迹，值得我们学习。
