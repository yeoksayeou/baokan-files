The performance took place a few kilometers from the border. The soldiers welcomed the guests as if it were a holiday. Every performance by the Song and Dance Troupe won warm applause and cheers from the soldiers. After the performance, the officers took the comrades of the Song and Dance Troupe to visit their barracks; the soldiers pulled the comrades of the Song and Dance Troupe to take pictures under the monument decorated with military emblems, and gave the comrades of the Song and Dance Troupe sculptures with police dogs (the symbol of the border guards). The representative of the border guards said in his speech: "The meeting of representatives of the Chinese and Czech armies, which are separated by more than 10,000 kilometers and guard the front lines of peace in the East and the West respectively, will be an unforgettable day in the history of the Czechoslovak army. We will always remember it, and we ask you to always remember it too." At the time of parting, with cheers and applause, the comrades of the Song and Dance Troupe and the border guards shook hands and kissed each other with reluctance.

On the 7th, the Song and Dance Troupe visited the border guards on the southern border of Czechoslovakia again and performed for them. This performance was held on the grass 200 meters away from the Czechoslovak border, and each performance was warmly welcomed. After the performance, the person in charge of the Song and Dance Troupe presented the PLA commemorative medal to the hero squad leader Z. Weimochile. At this moment, thunderous applause erupted throughout the audience. After the show, the soldiers lifted Weimochile up and tossed him back and forth in the air to express their congratulations to him. Here, the Song and Dance Troupe also visited the barracks of the border guards.
