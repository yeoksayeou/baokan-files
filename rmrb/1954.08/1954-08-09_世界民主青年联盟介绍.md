The world democratic youth movement is a huge force struggling for peace, and leading this movement is the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

After the end of World War II, the youth of all countries, deeply affected by the war, urgently demanded the defense of peace and youth rights, forming a world-scale organized democratic youth movement. In November 1945, more than 500 representatives from 63 countries, representing 30 million young people, held the first World Youth Congress in London. The congress determined that the task of the world democratic youth movement was to unite young people of different races and colors, different political and religious beliefs, and struggle to defend world peace, fight for youth rights, and create a better future. The conference decided to establish the World Federation of Democratic Youth as a permanent body to lead this movement.

Based on the development of the post-war international situation, the World Federation of Democratic Youth correctly formulated the tasks of the democratic youth movement in various periods. At the Second World Youth Congress held in September 1949, the World Federation of Democratic Youth pointed out that the conspiracy of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States to launch a new war was the greatest threat to the fate of young people. Therefore, it demanded that the struggle of young people in various countries to defend their rights be closely combined with the struggle of the people of various countries to defend peace. The Third World Youth Congress held in July 1953 adopted a resolution calling on young people of all countries to strive for further relaxation of the international situation in order to strive for a better future.

Over the years, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has carried out many activities to support the struggles of young people in various countries and enhance understanding and friendship among young people of various countries. The World Federation of Democratic Youth holds "World Youth Week" every year from March 21st to March 28th. Since 1947, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has organized four large-scale festivals involving millions of young people. These activities have enhanced the unity of young people from various countries and eliminated the artificial barriers created by warmongers. The World Federation of Democratic Youth also organized various youth gatherings according to regions and issues of concern to young people. For example, the Southeast Asia Youth Conference was held in India in 1948, and the Latin American Youth Congress was held in Mexico. The International Conference for the Defense of Youth Rights held in Vienna in March 1953 was attended by representatives from 72 countries. The conference pointed out to the youth of capitalist and colonial countries how to fight for improving their lives. Through these activities, the World Federation of Democratic Youth expanded its influence among young people from a wide range of strata in various countries. By the time the Third World Youth Congress was held in July 1953, the World Federation of Democratic Youth had established organizations in 92 countries and had 83 million members. At the Third World Youth Congress, 142 youth organizations belonging to the Socialist Party, the Radical Party, the Liberal Party, the Catholic Church, the Islamic Church, and the Buddhist Church established links with the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

Since the Third World Youth Congress, the democratic youth movement has continued to develop over the past year. In May of this year, with the support of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the European Youth Conference was held in Berlin. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Eastern European People's Democratic countries, and France, Britain, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands attended the conference. This conference showed that the most important task of European youth at present is to oppose the "European Defense Community" treaty. Under this common goal, European youth will strengthen the consistency of action in the future. In addition, the World Federation of Democratic Youth is currently making intensive preparations for the International Rural Youth Conference to be held this year. In the past year, in order to more effectively unite more young people around it, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has sent delegations to visit India, Indonesia, Canada, Latin American countries, the Middle East, French Africa, and most European countries. The scale of the festival activities and regional gatherings organized by the World Federation of Democratic Youth has also become larger and larger.

The World Federation of Democratic Youth has paid special attention to safeguarding the interests of the most vulnerable youth in colonial and dependent countries in its activities. The World Federation of Democratic Youth holds "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism" in various countries on February 21st every year, mobilizing young people of various countries to support the struggle of young people in colonial and dependent countries against imperialist colonial enslavement. The World Federation of Democratic Youth has helped the consolidation and development of the youth movement in colonial and dependent countries with various concrete measures. For example, after World War II, many countries in Latin America and Africa began to establish progressive youth organizations with the help of the World Federation of Democratic Youth; the National Federation of Brazilian Youth was established in Brazil; the "Vanguard Youth League" was established in British Guiana. With the help of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the movement to defend peace and defend their rights by the youth of colonial and dependent countries is developing. Student youth in Lebanon, Syria, and Transjordan widely held demonstrations against the Turkish-Ba'ath military agreement in March this year; in Iran, local youth collected 250,000 signatures for the Stockholm Declaration and 60,000 signatures for the declaration requiring the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty; in Algeria, there were 261 strikes in 1952, and Algerian young workers played an important role in these strikes; in Lebanon, the unanimous demand of the youth forced the government to establish a national institution of higher learning.

The prestige of the World Federation of Democratic Youth is constantly increasing in colonial and dependent countries. The number of young people from colonial and dependent countries joining the World Federation of Democratic Youth was 3 million in 1946, and increased to 10 million in 1949; at present, the member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in colonial countries have developed to six times that of 1945.

    世界民主青年联盟介绍
    世界民主青年运动是一支为和平而斗争的巨大力量，领导这个运动的是世界民主青年联盟。
    第二次世界大战结束后，深受战争灾难的各国青年迫切地要求保卫和平和青年权利，形成了世界规模的有组织的民主青年运动。一九四五年十一月，代表着六十三个国家的三千万青年的五百多个代表，在伦敦举行了第一届世界青年代表大会，大会确定世界民主青年运动的任务是：团结不同种族和肤色、不同政治和宗教信仰的青年，为保卫世界和平、争取青年权利和美好的将来而斗争。大会决定成立世界民主青年联盟，作为领导这个运动的常设机构。
    世界民主青联根据战后国际形势的发展，正确地制订了各个时期民主青年运动的任务。在一九四九年九月举行第二届世界青年代表大会时，世界民主青联指出了以美国为首的帝国主义集团企图发动新战争的阴谋是对青年的命运的最大威胁，因此要求把各国青年保卫权利的斗争和各国人民保卫和平的斗争密切地结合起来。一九五三年七月间举行的第三届世界青年代表大会，又通过决议号召各国青年争取进一步缓和国际局势，以争取美好的将来。
    世界民主青联历年来进行了许多活动来支持各国青年的斗争，增进各国青年间的了解和友谊。世界民主青联每年从三月二十一日到三月二十八日举行“世界青年周”。从一九四七年起，世界民主青联已组织了四次规模巨大的有成百万青年参加的联欢节，这些活动增进了各国青年的团结，消除了战争贩子们建立的人为隔阂。世界民主青联并按照地区和青年们所关心的问题分别组织了各种青年集会。如：一九四八年在印度召开了东南亚青年大会，在墨西哥召开了拉丁美洲青年代表大会。一九五三年三月在维也纳举行的国际保卫青年权利大会有七十二个国家的代表参加，这次大会向资本主义和殖民地国家的青年们指出了如何争取改善生活的道路。世界民主青联通过了这些活动在各国广泛阶层的青年中扩大了自己的影响，到一九五三年七月举行第三届世界青年代表大会时，世界民主青联已经在九十二个国家中建立了组织，并拥有着八千三百万会员；在第三届世界青年代表大会上，又有一百四十二个属于社会党、激进党、自由党、天主教、回教和佛教的青年组织和世界民主青联建立了连系。
    在第三届世界青年代表大会召开以后，一年来的民主青年运动继续有了发展。今年五月间，在世界民主青联支持下，在柏林举行了欧洲青年代表会议，参加会议的有苏联、东欧人民民主国家以及法国、英国、德国、奥地利、比利时、卢森堡、瑞典、挪威、丹麦和荷兰等国的代表。这次会议表明，欧洲青年当前最重要的任务是反对“欧洲防务集团”条约，在这个共同目标下，欧洲青年今后将加强行动的一致。此外，世界民主青联目前正在紧张地筹备着将在今年举行的国际农村青年大会。一年来，世界民主青联为了更有效地使更多的青年团结在它的周围，曾派出代表团访问了印度、印尼、加拿大、拉丁美洲各国，中近东、法属非洲和大部分欧洲国家，世界民主青联组织的节日活动和区域性联欢的规模也越来越大。
    世界民主青联在它的活动中特别注意了保卫处境最恶劣的殖民地和附属国青年的利益，世界民主青联每年二月二十一日在各国举行“反对殖民制度斗争日”，发动各国青年声援殖民地和附属国青年为反对帝国主义殖民地奴役而进行的斗争。世界民主青联以各种具体措施帮助了殖民地和附属国的青年运动的巩固和发展，例如，在第二次世界大战以后，拉丁美洲和非洲的许多国家在世界民主青联的帮助下开始建立了进步的青年组织；在巴西成立了全国性的巴西青年联合会；在英属圭亚那成立了
  “先锋青年联盟”。在世界民主青联的帮助下，殖民地和附属国青年的保卫和平和保卫他们权利的运动正在开展中。黎巴嫩、叙利亚、外约旦的学生青年在今年三月广泛地举行了反对土巴军事协定的示威；在伊朗，当地青年曾为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集了二十五万人的签名，为要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言征集了六万人的签名；在阿尔及利亚，一九五二年曾发生了二百六十一次罢工，阿尔及利亚青年工人在这些罢工中起了重要作用；在黎巴嫩，青年的一致要求迫使政府设立了一所民族的高等学校。
    世界民主青联的威信在殖民地和附属国中不断提高，加入世界民主青联的殖民地和附属国青年一九四六年为三百万人，一九四九年就增加到一千万人；目前，世界民主青联在殖民地国家的会员组织已发展为一九四五年的六倍。　（新华社）
