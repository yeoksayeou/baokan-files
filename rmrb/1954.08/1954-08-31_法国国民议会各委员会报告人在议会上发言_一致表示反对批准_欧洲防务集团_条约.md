Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th -- The French National Assembly began its session on the "European Defense Community" issue on the 28th. From the morning of the 28th to the morning of the 29th, the Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee, National Defense Committee, Judiciary Committee, Finance Committee, Industrial Production Committee, and Overseas Territories Committee all expressed their opposition to ratifying the "European Defense Community" treaty in their respective reports.

    At the meeting on the 28th, following the report by Jules Moch (Socialist Party), the rapporteur for the Foreign Affairs Committee, Radical Socialist member Gaboury presented a report on the Bonn Treaty on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He stated that the committee was convinced that the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty were inseparable; until the National Assembly made a decision on the "European Defense Community," the Bonn Treaty should be temporarily shelved.

    Subsequently, Social Republican member Triboulet delivered a report on behalf of the National Defense Committee. This report sharply criticized the "European Defense Community" treaty from a military perspective. Triboulet said that the terms of this treaty were "discriminatory against France"; if this treaty were passed, then France could neither guarantee its own national defense nor appoint its own generals. He expressed surprise, saying: "The United States and Britain are forcing France to join this alliance, which will deprive France of its rights, while the other two major powers (referring to Britain and the United States) among the three major powers retain these rights." Triboulet concluded by requesting the National Assembly to reject the bill on ratifying the "European Defense Community" treaty on behalf of the National Defense Committee.

    Chairman of the National Defense Committee, Max Lejeune, mentioned that the possibility of the German army embarking on a path of adventure, "with modern industry, general staff, and war ministry," was cause for concern. He cited facts to illustrate the growth of militaristic ideology in West Germany. He concluded by saying that Western countries could plan another form of European security to replace this group.

    The two rapporteurs of the Judiciary Committee, Palewski and Moreau-Chaffery, also advocated rejecting the bill on ratifying this treaty. Palewski said that this treaty would place a large number of French people beyond the control of French courts and subject them to foreign laws. Moreau-Chaffery said that the National Assembly had no right to ratify this treaty because it was contrary to the constitution.

    Finance Committee rapporteur Max Brusset said that the "European Defense Community" seriously affected the nation's economic life and prevented France from controlling some important sectors of its economy.

    Continuing to speak at the morning meeting on the 29th was Pierre-Olivier Lapie (Socialist Party), the rapporteur for the Industrial Production Committee. On behalf of the committee, he recommended rejecting the "European Defense Community" treaty, considering the economic terms of the treaty to be "the most dangerous." He said that these terms stipulated that France's entire economy should be subject to "military needs"; these terms would lead to the collapse of the national economy; these terms could not exempt France from the threat of the "dangerous and rapid" development of West Germany, because these terms could allow West Germany to "revive militarily" smoothly.

    Overseas Territories Committee rapporteur Apithy (Independent Republican) also recommended rejecting the "European Army" treaty. He said that the committee felt obliged to solemnly draw the National Assembly's attention to the fact that ratifying the Paris Treaty would not only endanger the unity of the Republic but also mean the rupture of the connection between the French in Europe and the French in the overseas territories.

    After the above six relevant committees of the National Assembly made their reports, French Prime Minister Mendès France then spoke.

    法国国民议会各委员会报告人在议会上发言
    一致表示反对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约
    【新华社三十日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会二十八日起举行关于“欧洲防务集团”问题的会议。自二十八日上午至二十九日上午，议会外交委员会、国防委员会、司法委员会、财政委员会、工业生产委员会和海外领地委员会都以各自的报告表示了反对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的意见。
    在二十八日的会议上，继外交委员会报告人儒勒·莫克（社会党）报告之后，激进社会党议员加包里代表外交委员会就波恩条约问题提出报告。他说：委员会深信波恩条约和巴黎条约是密不可分的；直到国民议会就“欧洲防务集团”作出决定以前，波恩条约应该暂时被搁置起来。
    接着，社会共和党议员特里布莱代表国防委员会做报告。这一报告从军事观点上尖锐地指责“欧洲防务集团”条约。特里布莱说：这一条约的条款是“歧视法国的”；如果这一条约被通过，那么法国既不能保障自己的国防，也不能任命自己的将军。他表示惊奇说：“美国和英国迫使法国加入这一联盟，这一联盟会剥夺法国的权利，而三大国中其他两个大国（指英国和美国）却保有这种权利。”特里布莱最后代表国防委员会要求国民议会拒绝关于批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的法案。
    国防委员会主席马克斯·勒荣纳谈到：由于德国军队“有了现代化的工业、参谋部和战争部”，它走上冒险道路的可能是值得令人忧虑的。他列举了一些事实来说明军国主义思想在西德的滋长。他最后说：西方国家可以计划另一种欧洲安全的形式来代替这一集团。
    司法委员会的两个报告人巴列夫斯基和摩罗—夏费里也主张否决关于批准这一条约的法案。巴列夫斯基说：这一条约将使一大部分法国人不受法国法院的控制，并使他们服从外国法律。摩罗—夏费里说：国民议会没有权利批准这一条约，因为这一条约和宪法相违背。
    财政委员会报告人马克斯·布吕赛说：“欧洲防务集团”严重地影响到全国的经济生活，它并使法国不再能控制自己经济中的一些重要的部门。
    在二十九日上午会议上继续发言的是工业生产委员会报告人皮埃尔—奥利维埃·拉毕（社会党）。他代表委员会建议拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约，认为这个条约的经济条款是“最危险的”。他说：这些条款规定法国整个经济要服从“军事需要”；这些条款会导致国家经济的崩溃；这些条款不能免除西德的“危险的和迅速的”发展对法国的威胁，因为这些条款能够使西德“军事复活”顺利进行。
    海外领地委员会报告人阿皮蒂（独立共和党）也建议拒绝“欧洲军”条约。他说：委员会认为有责任郑重提请国民议会注意：批准巴黎条约不仅会给共和国的统一带来危险，而且意味着欧洲的法兰西人和海外领地的法兰西人之间的联系的破裂。
    在国民议会上述六个有关的委员会作了报告以后，法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯接着发言。
