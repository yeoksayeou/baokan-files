Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 20th. "The Hindustan Times" published an editorial on the 17th entitled "The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Imposed on the People," criticizing the eight-nation conference to be held in the Philippines to discuss the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The editorial wrote: The members participating in the eight-nation conference include "five countries that are either European or of European descent. Among the remaining three countries, the Philippines is separated from the Asian continent by a thousand miles of sea. Pakistan is not part of Southeast Asia, but is on the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, the only country in this region to which the planned defense organization applies is Thailand. It is truly astonishing that even today, Western countries still dream that they can decide the fate of Asian countries without consulting those countries that are actually related to the problems."

The editorial pointed out that the success of the Geneva Conference proves that "Communist countries are eager to maintain peace in this region, not to continue the war. If there is any threat to peace in the Far East, it is due to Syngman Rhee's open advocacy of an anti-communist war and Chiang Kai-shek's eagerness to provoke a war between the two blocs, hoping to regain power on the Chinese mainland, rather than due to any action by the Communists."

The editorial refuted the United States' excuse for establishing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization by "defending" Southeast Asian countries from "Communist aggression," and asked, "What does the Baguio Conference intend to defend?" The editorial said that in Southeast Asia, Indochina and Burma are not worried about so-called "aggression" from the north. The reason why Thailand is eager to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is not really afraid of "Communist aggression," "but because it realizes that the current regime is a feudal regime and cannot represent the people at all, and therefore fears any progressive movement that demands the democratization of its political institutions."

The editorial finally emphasized that "What Southeast Asia needs today is peace and improvement of the economic life of its people, not weapons and military guarantees. It needs butter, not guns."

The "Indian Express" also criticized the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization planned by the United States in its commentary, saying that it would be a purely military organization. The newspaper emphasized that major Asian countries have refused to participate in such organizations, including India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon. The newspaper warned that Indochina has achieved a ceasefire and that nothing should be done to jeopardize the prospects for peace and hinder the work of the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission in Indochina.

### 印度报纸发表评论指出  东南亚需要和平生活不需要军事保证

    印度报纸发表评论指出
    东南亚需要和平生活不需要军事保证
    【新华社新德里二十日电】“印度斯坦时报”十七日以“强加在人们身上的东南亚公约组织”为题发表社论，抨击即将在菲律宾举行的讨论东南亚公约组织问题的八国会议。
    社论写道：参加八国会议的成员中有“五个国家不是欧洲国家就是欧洲血统的国家。在其余三个国家中，菲律宾同亚洲大陆相隔有一千英里的海面。巴基斯坦并不是东南亚的一部分，而是在印度次大陆上，因此，策划中的防御组织适用于这个地区的唯一国家只是泰国。甚至在今天，西方国家还梦想它们可以不和那些在实际上与问题有关的国家一起商量就决定亚洲国家的命运，这真是令人惊奇的事。”
    社论指出，日内瓦会议的成功证明“共产党国家渴望保持这个地区的和平，而不是继续进行战争。如果说对远东和平有任何威胁的话，那都是由于李承晚公开鼓吹反共战争和蒋介石急于挑起两个集团之间的战争、希望从而使蒋介石再度在中国大陆上掌握政权而引起的，而不是由于共产党的任何行动而引起的。”
    社论驳斥了美国以“保卫”东南亚国家免遭“共产党侵略”来作为成立东南亚公约组织的借口，并问道：“碧瑶会议打算保卫什么呢？”社论说，在东南亚，印度支那和缅甸都不担心所谓来自北面的“侵略”。而泰国之所以急于参加东南亚公约组织也并不是真正害怕“共产党侵略”，“而是由于意识到目前的政权是封建主义的政权，丝毫不能代表人民，因此害怕任何要求使它的政治机构民主化的进步运动”。
    社论最后强调指出：“东南亚今天所需要的是和平和改善它的人民的经济生活，而不是武器和军事保证。它需要牛油，而不需要大炮。”
    “印度快报”也在评论中斥责美国所策划的东南亚公约组织说，这将是纯粹军事性的组织。这个报纸强调指出，亚洲各主要国家都拒绝参加这种组织，其中包括印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和锡兰。报纸警告说，印度支那已经停火，不应当干出任何事情使和平前景遭受损害和阻碍印度支那国际监督和监察委员会在印度支那的工作。
