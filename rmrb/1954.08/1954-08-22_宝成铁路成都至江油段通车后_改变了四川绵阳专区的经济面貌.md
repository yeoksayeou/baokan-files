    After the opening of the Chengdu-Jiangyou section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the economic landscape of Mianyang Prefecture in Sichuan Province is being transformed. With the support of railway transportation, a petroleum drilling site in Mianyang Prefecture along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway line is accelerating its work. Heavy drill pipes, boilers, chimneys, and other equipment weighing more than ten tons, which could not be transported in the past, are now transported by train to the vicinity of the construction site.
    Many factories in Mianyang Prefecture have obtained cheap coal transported by train, solving the transportation difficulties in the production and sales of raw materials and finished products. In the past, coal used in Mianyang city was mostly transported from Mianzhu and Anxian by "chicken carts," with freight costs more than three times higher than the cost of the coal itself. Coal from Nanchong, Hechuan, and other places thousands of miles away was transported in, with prices as high as 1.2 million yuan per ton, and there were frequent stock-outs during the busy farming season. Many factories had to use firewood as fuel. After the opening of the Chengdu-Mianyang section, coal from Qijiang and other places was continuously transported to Mianyang. From January to early June of this year alone, more than 3,500 tons were transported in, and the prices of lump coal and pulverized coal were only 60% to 70% of the past prices. After many factories switched to coal as fuel, their costs were greatly reduced.
    With the progress of the railway construction, some new factories are also being planned and built. For example, cow bones in Guangyuan used to be insufficient to meet the needs of factory construction, and had to be transported to Nanchong to be made into bone meal and then transported back for sale. In the future, cow bones from Jiangyou, Jiange, and other places along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway can be transported to Guangyuan. The Guangyuan County Finance Committee has begun to prepare for the construction of a new bone meal factory to supply farmers with cheap fertilizer. Since the partial opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the production and sales of agricultural, sideline, local, and special products along the line have also begun to undergo significant changes. Mianzhu County sold only 13 kinds of small local and special products last year, but this year it has increased to 23 kinds. Muer mushrooms, cured meat, walking sticks, mushrooms, charcoal, and other products from Jiange County were difficult to transport out in the past, but sales have increased greatly this year. The soil danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) sold by farmers in Mianyang County this year is worth about 260 million yuan. The opening of the railway has also reduced the prices of fertilizers and agricultural tools, increasing farmers' purchasing power. The price of Deyang rapeseed cake used by farmers in Mianyang County has decreased by 16% compared with before the opening of the railway. From January to early June of this year, more than 1,900 tons of fertilizer powder were transported to Mianyang. The selling prices of various industrial products in Mianyang Prefecture have also been reduced with the decrease in freight costs, directly improving people's living standards. In the past six months, the people of the whole county have reduced their expenditure by more than 129 million yuan from the reduction in salt prices.
    The markets along the line have also become more active. Many new warehouses have been added along the road from Mianyang Railway Station to the city. State-owned petroleum companies, coal industry building materials companies have newly established branches in Mianyang. Merchants from Guangyuan, Suining, Santai, and other places have come to do business one after another, and Xinhua Bookstore has also expanded its storefront. (Tong Gan)

    宝成铁路成都至江油段通车后
    改变了四川绵阳专区的经济面貌
    宝成铁路成都至江油段通车后，正改变着四川省绵阳专区的经济面貌。宝成铁路线上绵阳专区境内某石油钻探工地，在铁路运输的支援下，正加快速度进行工作。过去无法运输的重型钻杆、锅炉、烟囱等十几吨重的器材，现在都由火车运到了工地附近。
    绵阳专区许多工厂得到火车运来廉价的煤，并解决了原料成品产销中的运输困难。绵阳城区用煤过去多从绵竹、安县用鸡公车运来，运费比成本高过三倍。南炭从千里以外的南充、合川等地运进，每吨价格高达一百二十万元左右，农忙时还常有脱销现象。许多工厂不得不用木柴做燃料。成绵段通车以后，綦江等地的煤源源运来绵阳，只今年一至六月上旬，就运进了三千五百多吨，块煤、粉煤的价格只相当于过去价格的百分之六十至七十。许多工厂改用煤做燃料后，成本大大降低。
    随着筑路工程的进展，一些新的工厂也在计划建设中。如广元的牛骨等，过去因原料不足供应建厂的需要，要运到南充制成骨粉，再运回销售。今后，宝成铁路沿线江油、剑阁等地的牛骨都可以运到广元，广元县财委已着手筹建一座新的骨粉工厂，供应农民廉价的肥料。宝成铁路局部通车以后，沿线的农、副、土、特产品的产销情况也已开始发生重大变化。绵竹县去年外销的小土特产只有十三种，今年增加到二十三种。剑阁县的木耳、腊肉、手杖、菌子、木炭等过去很难运出，今年销量都大大增加。绵阳县农民今年卖出的土丹参，约可值二亿六千万元。通车也降低了肥料和农具的价格，提高了农民的购买力。绵阳县农民用的德阳菜枯，价格比通车前降低了百分之十六。今年一至六月上旬运到绵阳的肥田粉就有一千九百多吨。绵阳专区各种工业品随着运费降低也减低了售价，直接提高了人民的生活水平。六个月来，全县人民从降低盐价中就减少了一亿二千九百多万元的支出。
    沿线的市场也进一步活跃起来了。绵阳火车站到城里的公路两旁新添了许多仓库，国营石油公司、煤业建筑器材公司都在绵阳新设了支公司，广元、遂宁、三台等地的商贩都纷纷赶来营业，新华书店也扩大了门市部。（通干）
