Farmers in Masen Township, Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province, Utilize Woniukeng to Store Floodwater and Compost Fertilizer

Masen Township, Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province, is located near the northern foot of the Zhongtiao Mountains. Sloping land and terraced fields account for more than half of the township's cultivated land. In the past, due to the lack of effective water storage and soil conservation measures, it was frequently subjected to flooding, resulting in annual production declines. During the drought prevention and resistance campaign in 1952, the experience of digging Woniukeng (Oxbow Pits) was promoted. By 1953, a total of 174 Woniukeng had been dug. In these two years, farmers not only used Woniukeng to block floodwaters and prevent erosion, but also used the stored water to compost green grass into green manure. According to statistics, each pit can store an average of more than 200 dan of water, and one flood can store more than 35,000 dan of water, which can compost more than 2,600 dan of fertilizer. This has played a significant role in increasing agricultural production throughout the township. In May and June of this year, in addition to repairing the existing Woniukeng, the township also newly dug 120 pits. At present, the township has a total of 294 Woniukeng. Each flood can store more than 58,800 dan of water, which can compost more than 4,400 dan of green manure, greatly reducing the force of mountain floods and increasing fertilizer. Now, the masses throughout the township are actively storing water and composting fertilizer. (Yan Mingxiang)

    山西省沁源县马森乡农民
    利用卧牛坑蓄洪沤肥
    山西省沁源县马森乡紧靠中条山北麓，乡内坡地和梯田占耕地面积一半多，过去因为没有很好地蓄水保土，经常遭受洪水冲刷，年年减产。一九五二年防旱抗旱运动中，开始推广挖卧牛坑的经验，到一九五三年共挖成卧牛坑一百七十四个。在这两年中，农民不仅利用卧牛坑拦蓄洪水防止冲刷，还利用蓄水把青草沤成绿肥。据统计：每个坑平均能蓄二百多担水，发一次洪水就蓄三万五千多担水，共可沤肥二千六百余担，这对全乡农业增产起了很大作用。今年五、六月间全乡除整修好旧有的卧牛坑外，又新挖了一百二十个，目前全乡共有了二百九十四个卧牛坑，每发一次洪水，可蓄水五万八千八百多担，能沤绿肥四千四百多担，大大减少了山洪水势，增加了肥料，现在全乡群众正积极蓄水沤肥。（阎明祥）
