Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch:

    The U.S. authorities are taking various measures to strengthen the military power of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan. According to Western news agencies, the first batch of F-86 Sabre jet fighters supplied by the United States to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits has been shipped to Taiwan, and two more batches will be shipped soon. Two destroyers supplied by the United States to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits arrived in Taiwan on the 4th. The United States will also soon send a naval officer to serve as the chief of staff of the military "aid" advisory group stationed in Taiwan. According to the International News Service, this situation indicates that "the United States will soon place more emphasis on the expansion of the Kuomintang navy." The Chiang Kai-shek bandits have also recently spent more than 10 million U.S. dollars to expand Taiwan's oil production and refining equipment in coordination with the U.S. measures to expand the Chiang Kai-shek air and naval forces.
    U.S. First Fleet Commander Phillips, who recently directed fleets and aircraft to carry out armed provocations against our country along the coast of Hainan Island, will lead a large number of officers to Taiwan next week to plan the expansion of aggressive actions against our country. The so-called "economic advisory group" led by Eisenhower's economic assistant, Steffan, will also arrive in Taiwan on the 10th to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandits plan to intensify the exploitation of the people of Taiwan and plunder Taiwan's resources, and to further strengthen U.S. economic control over Taiwan.
    The Chiang Kai-shek bandits are also following the orders of their U.S. masters to intensify the recruitment of cannon fodder and expand their military strength. The Chiang Kai-shek "Legislative Yuan" passed the so-called "Revised Military Service Law," stipulating that all men between the ages of 18 and 45 must serve in the military and sacrifice their lives for the United States and its running dogs in launching new aggressions. According to Agence France-Presse, the U.S. military "aid" advisory group stationed in Taiwan has planned to conscript more than 100,000 young Taiwanese men into the Chiang Kai-shek army every year, attempting to make the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army "completely rejuvenate" within three years. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits also force all graduates of universities, colleges, and senior high schools to receive one year and four months of military training, respectively, and incorporate them into the reserve force of the Chiang Kai-shek army. A large number of students in schools are also induced to participate in the so-called "summer youth combat training" and are incorporated into the so-called "military service teams," "marine combat brigades," and "shooting brigades" to receive military training. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits also use deceptive means such as so-called "further education" and "employment" to lure overseas Chinese youths from Southeast Asia to Taiwan, forcibly incorporating them into the Chiang Kai-shek army to serve as cannon fodder.

    美国加紧扩充蒋匪军事力量
    【新华社七日讯】美国当局正在采取各种措施，加强台湾蒋匪的军事力量。据西方通讯社报道，美国供给蒋匪的第一批F—八十六型佩刀式喷气机已启运去台湾，另外两批也将在最近启运。美国供给蒋匪的两艘驱逐舰已在四日抵达台湾。美国不久还将派遣一名海军军官去担任驻台湾的军事“援助”顾问团的参谋长。据国际新闻社透露，这个情况说明，“美国不久将要更加着重国民党海军的扩充。”蒋匪在最近也以一千多万美元扩大台湾的石油生产和炼油设备，以配合美国扩充蒋匪海空军的措施。
    最近在海南岛沿海指挥舰队和飞机对我国进行武装挑衅的美国第一舰队司令菲利普斯将在下周率领很多军官到台湾去，策划扩大对我国的侵略行动。由艾森豪威尔的经济助手斯特芬率领的所谓“经济顾问团”也将在十日到达台湾，帮助蒋匪策划加紧压榨台湾人民和掠夺台湾富源，并进一步加强美国对台湾的经济控制。
    蒋匪也奉它美国主子的命令加紧搜罗炮灰，扩充军事力量。蒋匪“立法院”通过了所谓“修正兵役法”，规定所有十八岁到四十五岁的男子都要服兵役，为美国和它的走狗发动新的侵略卖命。据法新社透露，驻台湾的美国军事“援助”顾问团已计划好每年强征十万名以上台湾青年参加蒋匪军队，企图使蒋匪胡子兵在三年之内“全部恢复年轻”。蒋匪还强迫所有大学、专科学校的毕业生和高级中学毕业生分别受一年和四个月的军事训练，并把他们编入蒋匪军的后备队。大批在校的学生也被诱迫参加所谓“暑期青年战斗训练”，编入所谓“军中服务队”、“海陆战斗大队”、“射击大队”等受军事训练。蒋匪还用所谓“升学”、“就业”等欺骗手段诱骗东南亚各地的华侨青年到台湾去，强制把他们编入蒋匪军队充当炮灰。
