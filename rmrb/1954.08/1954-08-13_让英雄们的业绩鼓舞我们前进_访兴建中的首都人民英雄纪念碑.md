    Let the Achievements of Heroes Encourage Us to Move Forward
    ——A Visit to the Under-Construction Monument to the People's Heroes in the Capital
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Ren Zhiqiao
    People still remember that on September 30, 1949, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference passed a resolution to build a monument to the People's Heroes who sacrificed their lives for the country in Tiananmen Square in the capital. At 6 p.m. that day, all the representatives attending the meeting held a foundation laying ceremony in front of Tiananmen. Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and the chief representatives of various units each took up a shovel and laid the first cornerstone for the monument.
    I recently visited the monument construction site. A giant crane, 58 meters high, was hoisting various stone materials. Excellent stonemasons from all over the country were processing granite, and the sounds of iron chisels striking stone echoed all around. Sixty-three-year-old technician Pang Shaoting, wearing reading glasses, sat aside meticulously carving stone materials. He said, "The People's Heroes sacrificed themselves for the happiness of the people. I must contribute the skills I've learned for more than forty years to the monument to be worthy of the martyrs." Engineer Hua Kezhuan is studying how to install the large stone core onto the body of the monument. This is an extremely complex and arduous task. The processed large stone core weighs sixty tons, and with packaging equipment and the impact of lifting, it requires 120 tons of lifting equipment. To ensure the safe hoisting of the stone, Hua Kezhuan and other engineers proposed four plans, discussed them with relevant parties five times, and drew more than twenty blueprints. Now, some of the designed machinery and tool blueprints have been sent to the factory.
    At the southern end of the monument construction site, there is a row of houses with many glass skylights. This is where sculptors and decoration experts work. Inside are displayed various clay, plaster, and white marble reliefs and statues, like an art exhibition hall. Mr. Liu Kaiqu, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association, Vice Mayor of Hangzhou Municipal People's Government, and a famous Chinese sculptor, who has been working here for more than a year, said, "We all deeply feel that this is a great and glorious task. This monument must achieve such a lofty purpose: not only to sing the praises of the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs, so that they will be immortal forever, but also to encourage the people of the whole country to learn from the martyrs to build our great motherland." Mr. Liu Kaiqu described the work of the experts to the reporter. In order to determine the shape of the monument, the architects designed and collected many patterns, referring to the Songyang Guan stele in Dengfeng, Henan Province, the Xiaojing stele in the Xi'an Stele Forest, and the Wanshoushan Kunming Lake stele in Beijing, and other ancient Chinese forms of commemorative steles. Originally, the top of the monument had been initially designed, but in order to build this "millennium plan" monument even better, the architects redesigned many styles and made more than ten models of the top of the monument, inviting more people to offer opinions and make revisions. The sculptors conducted very complex and careful work on the selection of relief themes. They studied nearly a hundred years of Chinese history and studied the important and well-known heroic deeds that could represent each historical stage. Experts in designing decorative patterns deeply studied the stone carvings on the monument. The Hundred Flowers and Grass pattern, which has been initially determined, is a theme familiar and beloved by the people of our country throughout the ages. This pattern has national characteristics in style, and expresses new content and realistic images in each part of the flowers, stems, tendrils, and ribbons. In the office of the Construction Committee of the People's Heroes Monument in the capital, the reporter saw letters from dozens of cities and villages such as Qiqihar, Dalian, Taiyuan, Qingdao, Shanghai, Nanyang, Chongqing, and Beijing. From these letters, it can be seen the infinite remembrance of the People's Heroes and the enthusiastic concern for the monument project by the people of the whole country. Gong Shangxing, who participated in the design of the Jiaodong Martyrs Tower in Shandong Province in 1945, has established regular contact with the monument construction site, constantly making suggestions and sending the martyr tower drawings he designed. Yang Lixiang, from Linyi County, Shandong Province, who participated in the relief work of the Ma'anshan, Xiaoqingshan, Wenfengshan, and Linyi City Martyrs Towers, is willing to dedicate his skills to this great project. Huang Huaijue, a worker from Shanghai who has been engraving characters for more than thirty years, wrote three letters requesting to participate in the engraving work of the monument and sent many samples of his engraving. Zhang Wendian, a stonemason from Nanyang County, Henan Province, heard that Beijing was building a monument to the People's Heroes and immediately wrote a letter introducing "Nanyang Jade" and expressed his willingness to help with mining. Chen Guangshu, a teacher from Baishatuo Primary School in Ba County, Sichuan Province, wrote a letter hoping to send some of the rubble left over from carving the Hero Monument to them to satisfy the children's desire to see the monument. Jin Yingbin, a fifteen-year-old student from Beijing No. 1 Middle School, wanted to see the monument project. One day, he wandered around the entrance of the construction site for a long time, but the construction site stipulated that visits were not allowed for the time being. So he sent a letter to the monument construction site, with seven fill-in-the-blank questions and three true-or-false questions, asking "Engineer Uncle" to fill them out for him. Soon, comrades from the monument construction site invited him to visit the models and pictures, and he happily went home. Wang Zhen, a construction worker from Taiyuan, sent a seventy-two-line poem as a gift to the People's Heroes who sacrificed their lives for the country. He wrote:
    Children of China,
    Images of heroes.
    Your achievements,
    Incomparably brilliant;
    Your deeds,
    Shall be forever remembered;
    Everything about you,
    We will always sing.

    让英雄们的业绩鼓舞我们前进
    ——访兴建中的首都人民英雄纪念碑
    新华社记者　任志樵
    人们还记得，一九四九年九月三十日，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议通过了在首都天安门广场建立一个为国牺牲的人民英雄纪念碑的决议。当天下午六时，出席会议的全体代表在天安门前举行了奠基典礼，中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席和各单位首席代表一一执锨铲土，为纪念碑奠下了第一块基石。
    记者最近访问了纪念碑工地。工地上五十八公尺高的巨型起重机正在吊运各种石料。来自全国各地的优秀的细石工人围绕着花岗石进行加工，铁钻和石料的撞击声响成一片。六十三岁的技术工人庞绍廷，戴着老花眼镜坐在一旁精细地雕琢着石料，他说：“人民英雄们为人们的幸福牺牲了，我要把四十多年学来的技术贡献给纪念碑，才对得起先烈。”工程师华克专正在研究如何把碑心大石料安装到碑身上的问题。这是一项极其复杂而又艰巨的任务。加工后的碑心大石料重六十吨，加上包装设备和起重时的冲击力，需要一百二十吨的起重设备。华克专和其他的工程师们为了保证石料安全吊装，提出了四种方案，和有关方面讨论了五次，绘制了二十多张蓝图。现在，有一部分设计好的机械和工具的蓝图已经送到工厂里去了。
    在纪念碑工地南端，有一排装设着很多玻璃天窗的房屋，这是雕塑和装饰专家们工作的地方。里边陈列着各种泥、石膏、汉白玉的浮雕和塑像，好像一座艺术品展览馆一样。已经在这里工作一年多的中国美术家协会副主席、杭州市人民政府副市长、中国著名雕塑家刘开渠先生说：“我们都深深感到这是一个伟大而又光荣的任务。这个纪念碑要达到这样一种崇高的目的：既要歌颂先烈们的革命精神，使之永垂不朽；又要鼓舞全国人民向先烈们学习，以建设我们伟大的祖国。”刘开渠先生向记者叙述了专家们工作的情况。建筑家们为了确定碑形，曾先后设计和征集了很多幅图案，参考了河南省登封的嵩阳观碑、西安碑林的孝经碑和北京的万寿山昆明湖碑等我国古代传统记功碑的形式。本来，碑顶已经初步设计出来了，但是建筑家们为了把这个“千年大计”的纪念碑建造得更好，又重新设计了很多种样式，并做出十多座碑顶模型，让更多的人提意见修改。雕塑家们对于浮雕题材的选择进行了非常复杂、仔细的工作。他们学习了中国近百年的历史，研究了足以代表每一个历史阶段的重要的和人所周知的英雄事迹。设计装饰花纹的专家们，深刻地研究了纪念碑上的石刻花纹。现已初步拟定的百花草纹是我国历代人民所熟悉而喜爱的题材。这种花纹，在风格上具有民族特征，在花朵、花梗、卷叶、丝带各部，都表现了崭新的内容和现实的形象。在首都人民英雄纪念碑兴建委员会的办事处里，记者看到了来自齐齐哈尔、大连、太原、青岛、上海、南阳、重庆和北京等数十个城市和乡村的信件，从这些信件里可以看出全国人民对于人民英雄们无限的追念和对纪念碑工程热情的关怀。一九四五年曾参加设计山东省胶东烈士塔的宫尚行已和纪念碑工地建立了经常的联系，不断提出建议和寄来他所设计的烈士塔图纸。山东省临沂县一位名叫杨立祥的，曾经参加过马鞍山、小青山、文峰山和临沂城烈士塔的浮雕工作，他愿意把自己的技术献给这一个伟大的工程。上海市一个刻了三十多年字的工人黄怀觉来了三次信，要求参加纪念碑的刻字工作，并寄来了很多他刻字的样本。河南省南阳县石工张文典听说北京要兴建人民英雄纪念碑，马上来信介绍“南阳玉”，愿意帮助开采。四川省巴县白沙陀小学的教师陈光淑来信希望把刻英雄碑剩下来的碎石寄一点给他们，以满足孩子们想看一看纪念碑的心愿。北京市第一中学十五岁的学生金英滨想看看纪念碑工程，有一天在工地门口转了很久，可是工地规定暂时不让参观。他便给纪念碑工地寄来了一封信，并附上七个填空题和三个是非题，要求“工程师伯伯”给他填写。不久，纪念碑工地的同志们请他来参观了模型和图片，他才高高兴兴地回家了。太原市建筑工人汪真，寄来了一首七十二行诗，作为对为国牺牲的人民英雄们的献礼。他这样写道：
    中华的儿女，
    英雄的形象。
    你们的功业，
    无比辉煌；
    你们的事迹，
    要永志不忘；
    你们的一切，
    我们将永远歌唱。
