    The Zhang Gong Dike is an important barrier for Hankou in defending against floods, and also an important front line in the struggle against floods. Currently, several important dangerous sections have been equipped with powerful searchlights that illuminate the surrounding areas as if it were daytime. More than two thousand full-time patrol teams, divided into inner and outer dike slope groups, are responsible for inspecting the safety of the dike body carefully, time and time again, day and night. Over nine thousand standby flood prevention team members are continuing to raise and reinforce the dikes, and are also preparing to depart at any time to assist in emergency rescue work, persevering in the battle to win the final stage of flood prevention.

    The Zhang Gong Dike, which extends fourteen kilometers from the Jiangda Dike in northeast Hankou, around the north of the city, and southwest to connect with the Zhang Gong Heng Dike and the Hanshui Dike, is currently experiencing the greatest test it has faced in the sixty years since its construction. Now, a vast lake stretches outside the Zhang Gong Dike, affected by the waters from both the Yangtze and Han rivers, with a water level four to five centimeters higher than the Yangtze River water level at the Wuhan Customs.

    Since late June, a flood prevention army of more than ten thousand people, composed of People's Liberation Army troops, workers from Wuhan City, and farmers from the suburbs, has been guarding the Zhang Gong Dike day and night, for more than a month now.

  Over the past month, the flood prevention team members have raised and reinforced the Zhang Gong Dike three or four times. The elevation of the dike (i.e., the height corresponding to the water level) has been generally raised from the original twenty-nine meters to twenty-nine and a half meters, to over thirty meters. The Zhang Gong Dike's raising and reinforcement project has always stayed ahead of the floodwaters. Currently, the dike construction is still in progress, and along the water surface several dozen feet from the dike, a twelve-kilometer-long wave-dissipating log raft has recently been laid parallel to the dike body, avoiding the direct impact of waves on the dike bank. Now, several thousand acres of rice paddies in the Gushu area inside the dike are growing luxuriantly, promising a bumper harvest. In the Dasai Lake near Daijiashan inside the dike, large and small fishing boats shuttle back and forth, and fishermen are busy casting their nets to catch fish. Looking out at the tall chimneys in Hankou City, they continue to belch thick smoke as usual.

    In the tense days of flood prevention, the people guarding the Zhang Gong Dike fought against the flood day and night. From the night of July 26th to August 1st, the Wuhan area was hit by continuous days of strong winds and heavy rain, with thunder and lightning at night, and huge waves constantly hitting the dike bank, shaking this magnificent dike that defends the main urban area of Wuhan. At this time, the heroes of flood prevention bravely jumped into the water to block the waves and carry out emergency repairs, braving the wind and rain to move stones, carry sacks, carry reed, and drive piles, protecting the dike body and protecting all the places where the waves were causing danger. Many people were knocked down by the waves and got up again, continuing to persevere even when injured. They guarded the Zhang Gong Dike day and night. On the 29th, an eight-level storm appeared in the lake outside the Zhang Gong Dike, and waves more than three feet high slammed into the dike bank, scattering the revetment reed laid on the dike bank in the third section, and the soil of the dike body was knocked off piece by piece by the waves, and the situation was extremely critical. All the flood prevention workers in the third section and more than two thousand workers from nearby factories went to the dike to carry out emergency repairs. The heroes who jumped into the water were choked time and time again by the overwhelming floodwaters, and some were even overturned on the shore and injured. However, the flood prevention workers, who were responsible to the people to the end, still bravely persisted in the battle. Some simply jumped onto the reed raft that was about to be washed away, and sat firmly without moving, regardless of the wind and waves. It was even more difficult for people who transported emergency rescue materials on the dike top, and there was a risk of being swept into the deep water by the waves crossing the dike if they were not careful. They took care of each other and persisted in their work, falling and getting up to work again. After more than a day of hard struggle, this section of the dike was finally rescued. In recent days, the struggle for emergency repairs in the middle section of the Zhang Gong Dike has become even more intense. The flood prevention team led by building worker and model worker Tang Jinyou worked continuously for two days and two nights in heavy wind and rain, completing the flood prevention project one day ahead of schedule. Yuan Xiuzhen, the head of the Hezuo Township and a Communist Party member, is an eighteen-year-old young woman who serves as the deputy head of the Hezuo section and the captain of the emergency rescue team, leading four or five hundred farmers in flood prevention and emergency rescue. At the tense moment of the flood surge, in order to gain time and speed up the progress of the project, she refused to rest for four consecutive days and nights, regardless of the wind, rain, and darkness, and has been leading the emergency flood prevention project on the dike. Youth League member Le Jinyuan took the lead in jumping into the water in the midst of strong winds and heavy rain. He unfortunately broke his finger when moving large stones to repair the dangerous section. Everyone advised him to go for treatment, but he still asked to continue working; when others sent him to the hospital, he excitedly said: "As long as the Zhang Gong Dike can be protected and the safety of the people of Wuhan can be guaranteed, it doesn't matter if I lose a finger!"

    Now, more than a thousand sheds and canvas tents have been newly built along the Zhang Gong Dike, where more than ten thousand flood prevention workers live. State-owned department stores, food companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, as well as banks, post and telecommunications, health and other departments in the city have set up temporary outlets, service teams, or mobile service vehicles on the Zhang Gong Dike to serve the flood prevention personnel. The Zhang Gong Dike is like a bustling and noisy long street. Day or night, cars are constantly running back and forth on the dike. The drainage section on the right side of Daijiashan has more than three hundred water pumps pumping out the accumulated water inside the dike day and night.

    守卫在张公堤上的人们
    新华社记者　曲一凡
    张公堤是汉口防御洪水的重要屏障，也是和洪水搏斗的重要的战线。现在，几处重要的险工地带，都架起了照明强烈的探照灯，把险工的四方照得和白天一样。两千多名专职的巡逻查堤队伍，分着内堤坡和外堤坡两组，分段负责，不分日夜一次又一次地细心检查着堤身安全。九千多名防汛常备队员，一方面继续加高和加固堤防，一方面准备待命随时出发协助抢险工作，为争取防汛最后阶段的胜利坚持不懈地战斗着。
    从汉口东北的沿江大堤起，绕过市区的北面，伸向西南经张公横堤和汉水堤防相连的张公堤，全长十四公里。现在张公堤外一片广阔的湖泊，受着长江、汉水两方面来水的影响，水位比武汉关长江水位还要高四、五公分。张公堤正经受着修成以后六十多年来遇到的最大的一次考验。
    六月下旬以来，一支由人民解放军部队、武汉市工人和市郊农民组成的一万多人的防汛大军，日日夜夜守卫在张公堤上，到现在已经一个多月了。
  一个多月来防汛队员们已经把张公堤加高加固了三、四次。堤身的标高（即与水位相应的高度）已由原来的二十九公尺到二十九公尺半，普遍加高到三十公尺以上。张公堤的加高加固工程始终走在洪水的前面。现在堤防工程还在继续进行中，沿着堤前数丈以外的水面上，最近又敷设了和堤身相平行的长达十二公里的防浪木排，避免了风浪直接向堤岸冲击。如今堤内姑嫂树一带的几千亩水稻正在繁茂地成长着，丰收在望。堤内戴家山附近的大赛湖里，大小渔船往来如梭，渔民们都在忙着张网捕鱼。远望汉口市内一个又一个的高大烟囱，和平常一样喷吐着浓烟。
    在紧张防汛的日子里，守卫在张公堤上的人们，不分昼夜地和洪水斗争着。由七月二十六日夜间起到八月一日，武汉地区连续数日受着狂风暴雨的袭击，夜间雷鸣电闪，堤外的大浪不断地向堤岸打来，震撼着这道捍卫武汉主要市区的雄伟的长堤。这时防汛的英雄们便奋不顾身地跳进水中阻浪抢险，冒着风雨搬石头，扛麻包，背芦柴，打桩木，抢护着堤身，抢护着一切被大浪冲击出险的地方。许多人被大浪扑倒了又爬起来，跌伤了照样坚持着。就这样夜以继日地守卫着张公堤。二十九日，张公堤外的湖里出现了八级的暴风，三尺多高的浪头向堤岸猛冲过来，第三工段在堤岸敷设的护岸芦柴被打散了，堤身的泥土被浪头一方一块地打落，情况万分危急。第三工段全体防汛员工和附近工厂的工人两千多人上堤抢险。跳到水中的英雄们，一次又一次被漫头带脸的洪浪打的噎住，有的甚至被掀在岸边撞伤。然而，对人民尽责到底的防汛员工们仍然奋不顾身地坚持战斗。有的干脆跳到将被冲散的芦排上，任凭风吹浪打稳坐不动。在堤顶上搬运抢险器材的人，行动更加困难，稍一不慎就有被过堤的大浪卷入深水中的危险。他们互相照顾坚持工作，跌倒了起来再干。经过一天多的艰苦斗争，终于使这一段堤防胜利脱险。最近几天，张公堤中段抢险斗争更加紧张起来。建筑工人、劳动模范唐锦友领导的防汛小队，在大风大雨中连续施工两天两夜，提前一天完成了防汛工程。合作乡的乡长、共产党员袁秀珍，是一个十八岁的年轻姑娘，担任着合作段副段长和抢险大队队长的职务，带领四、五百个农民防汛抢险。在洪水猛涨的紧张关头，为了赢得时间加速工程进度，她不管风雨和黑夜，一连四天四夜不肯休息，一直在堤上领导突击防汛工程。青年团员乐金元在狂风暴雨中带头跳下水去。他在搬运大石头堵修险工中，不幸被一块大石打断了手指，大家都劝他去治疗，他还要求坚持工作；当别人把他送到医院时，他还是激动地说：“只要张公堤能保住，保卫武汉人民的安全，我少一个手指头也算不得什么！”
    现在沿着张公堤新搭起一千多间工棚和帆布篷帐，一万多防汛员工便住宿在这里。市内的国营百货公司、食品公司、供销合作社以及银行、邮电、卫生等部门，都在张公堤上设立了临时门市部、服务队或流动服务车，为防汛人员服务。张公堤像一条繁华喧闹的长街。不分白天或黑夜，汽车不断地在堤上来来往往奔忙着。戴家山右首的排水工段，三百多部抽水机日夜不息地排除堤内积水。
