The performance of the Indonesian Art Troupe this time includes wonderful representative programs from various parts of Indonesia, which were produced on those beautiful islands, in the lives of peace-loving and kind people. They come together, develop each other, and constitute the rich and colorful Indonesian national art, becoming a unique part of the entire Oriental art. We are very happy to have the opportunity to appreciate such art today. We believe that through the art troupe's visit and performance in China, the cultural exchange between China and Indonesia, which has a historical tradition, will be further developed, and the connection between the literary and artistic circles of the two countries will also be strengthened, thereby enhancing the friendship between the people of the two countries.

Indonesian Ambassador Mononutu spoke. He said that the Indonesian government sent the art troupe to China as envoys of Indonesia's lofty ideals, introducing the cultural construction of the Indonesian nation to the Chinese people. Through this visit and performance, the friendship between the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China will be further strengthened.

Then, the art troupe performed many wonderful programs. These programs focused on folk dances from Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi. Among them were the Baglena dance, which expresses patriotism, the Taya U Gel dance, which expresses the production of working people, the Bulawiro Guno dance, which expresses martial spirit, the Candle dance, which expresses folk love, and the modern dance Knight Dance. These dances were warmly welcomed by the audience.
