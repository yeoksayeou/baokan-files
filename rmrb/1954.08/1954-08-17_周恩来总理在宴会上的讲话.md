Dear young friends,

　　I am very glad to be able to host you here today. You have come from all parts of the world to Beijing, the capital of our country, to hold the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council meeting. This is an honor for our country and people. On behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend a warm welcome to you.

　　Your meeting has already concluded. At this meeting, you focused on the issue of the youth movement in colonial and dependent countries. You unanimously agreed that striving for national independence is the sacred right of the youth in these countries and the fundamental guarantee for realizing the bright future of youth. Supporting the people and youth of these countries in their struggle for national independence is not only a just act but also a contribution to the cause of world peace. Please allow me to express my warm congratulations on the success of your meeting.

　　The movement to uphold world peace, through the efforts of peace-loving people and youth all over the world, has been developing more and more extensively. The Korean armistice a year ago and the recent agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina have played a significant role in easing international tensions. However, the US aggressive clique is not reconciled to its failure. They are plotting to organize various opposing military blocs for the purpose of aggression and creating new tensions. Therefore, we must be vigilant and strive to oppose and prevent the realization of this aggressive conspiracy.

　　Our Chinese government and people have always loved peace and pursued a foreign policy of peaceful coexistence with all countries in the world. Recently, the governments of China and India and the governments of China and Burma respectively issued joint statements, reiterating the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The friendship and solidarity between Chinese youth and peace-loving youth from all countries in the world is an important factor in promoting peaceful and cooperative relations between China and other countries. We hope that, through the efforts of peace-loving youth from all countries in the world, we can further develop peaceful cooperation between China and other countries.

　　Please allow me to raise my glass to celebrate the development and growth of the world youth peace and democratic movement!

　　Long live the solidarity of the people and youth of the world!

　　Long live world peace!

    周恩来总理在宴会上的讲话亲爱的青年朋友们：
      我很高兴今天能够在这里招待你们。你们从世界各个地方，来到我国的首都北京，举行世界民主青年联盟理事会会议，这是我们国家和人民的荣幸。我谨代表中华人民共和国的政府和人民，对你们表示热烈的欢迎。
    你们的会议已经闭幕了。在这次会议上，你们着重地讨论了殖民地附属国青年运动的问题。你们一致认为，争取民族独立是这些国家青年的神圣权利，是实现青年美好的将来的根本保证。支持这些国家人民和青年为民族独立的斗争，不仅是正义的行为，同时也是对世界和平事业的贡献。请容许我，对你们的会议的成功表示热烈的祝贺。
    拥护世界和平的运动，经过全世界爱好和平的人民和青年的努力，已经愈来愈广泛地开展了。一年以来的朝鲜停战和最近日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题所达成的协议，为缓和国际紧张局势起了重大的作用。但是，美国侵略集团不甘心于自己的失败。他们正在策动组织各种各样的以侵略为目的的对立的军事集团，制造新的紧张局势。因此，我们必须提高警惕，努力反对和制止这种侵略阴谋的实现。
    我们中国的政府和人民，一向爱好和平，奉行与世界各国和平共处的外交政策。最近中印两国政府和中缅两国政府分别发表了联合声明，重申互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则。中国青年和世界各国爱好和平青年的友谊团结是促进中国与世界各国建立和平合作关系的一个重要因素。我们希望，通过世界各国爱好和平的青年的努力，进一步地发展中国与世界各国的和平合作。
    请让我举杯庆祝世界青年和平民主运动的发展壮大！
    全世界人民和青年的团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
