　　Xinhua News Agency, August 5th—Floods have recently occurred in many countries in South Asia and the Middle East, causing great losses to the people of these countries.

　　In Bihar Province, India, nine rivers are currently flooding, having submerged four counties in northern Bihar Province, inundating fields, and washing away approximately one thousand square miles of crops and seedlings, causing severe damage to grains and affecting millions of people (mostly tenant farmers). According to the Indian News Service on the 3rd, the water level of the Gandak River in Bihar Province has risen to its highest level in more than sixty years. Floods have entered the northern part of Muzaffarpur city. It is said that about 700,000 people in the southern part of Muzaffarpur are affected by the disaster. Several sections of the highway from Muzaffarpur to Sitamarhi have been flooded. News agency reports state that the floods of the Bagmati River have submerged the lowlands of Darbhanga city. Simultaneously, the floods of the Brahmaputra River have submerged houses in Saikhowa, Lakhimpur County, Assam Province. Many railway bridges in Assam Province have been washed away. Unharvested crops have been widely damaged. In addition to the Brahmaputra River, the Dibang River, the Luhit River, and the Siang River have also suddenly flooded, submerging the northeast and south of Dibrugarh. In northern Bengal Province, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, and Siliguri have all been severely affected by the floods of the Teesta River and its tributaries. Vast areas of rice paddies have been submerged by floods, endangering the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. Cooch Behar city and hundreds of neighboring villages have been threatened by unprecedented floods. According to an Agence France-Presse report on the 2nd, about 100,000 people in Uttar Pradesh, India, have been affected by the floods.

　　In East Pakistan, the rivers have continued to flood recently. The current water level of the Buriganga River is the highest in history. The southern area of Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, is in danger of being severely submerged. Many houses have been flooded. Telephone lines between Dhaka and the northern districts of East Pakistan have been cut. Thousands of people have been made homeless, and crops have suffered great losses. According to a United Press International report on the 4th, more than one million residents in a 15,000-square-mile area in the northern half of East Pakistan have been affected by the floods. Prior to this, the Associated Press reported on July 5th that more than fifty people had died due to floods near Quetta in West Pakistan, and five hundred families had been displaced.

　　In Nepal, the highway connecting the capital Kathmandu has recently been impassable due to the foundations being washed away by floods. Crops and houses have suffered great damage. Most of the rivers in Nepal, including the Kosi River and the Tamor River, are flooding.

　　According to an Agence France-Presse report on the 4th, many areas of Afghanistan are currently experiencing floods. The water level of the Kabul River in Afghanistan is rising, and there is a risk of flooding in the areas along the river. In March of this year, the Helmand River, Farah River, and Khash River basins in Afghanistan experienced floods, and many places, including the Juy-i-Chin district of Farah province, suffered great losses.

　　In Iran, according to a recent report in the Iranian newspaper "Ettela'at," floods occurred in rural areas near Qazvin, resulting in four hundred deaths.
