Wuhan's Hydropower Workers Overcome Various Difficulties to Persist in Safe Production
    Ensuring Flood Control Power and Normal Supply of Water and Electricity to the City
    Residents and Students Organize Flood Control Service Teams to Serve Flood Control Personnel
    Wuhan's hydropower workers overcame various difficulties and ensured the normal supply of electricity for flood control and the city's water and electricity needs.
    At the start of flood control, the city's levee defense frontline urgently needed electricity. To promptly supply electricity to the newly built pumping station on Zhanggong Levee in the northern suburbs of Wuhan and to provide lighting for levee repair, the line workers of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau and the Central South Electric Power Engineering Company worked day and night to rapidly erect two 35-kilometer-long transmission lines. During the construction of the lines, the workers adopted a combined assembly line method to speed up construction. Sometimes the accumulated water submerged their entire lower bodies, and they were covered in mud. Sometimes it rained heavily, and sometimes the sun was scorching, but they persevered and completed the two new lines in five or six days. The workers also promptly installed more than 280 motors for the new pumping station, enabling a large number of pumps to be put into operation quickly. Normally, each motor requires a starter switch, but at that time, there were not enough starter switches. If they had to go back and forth to purchase them, it would delay the installation time. Technician Sheng Xiyao proposed a solution to use one starter switch to drive multiple motors, solving this difficulty and saving the state over 2 billion yuan.
    The line workers have not rested a single day since the end of June. They gave up their Sundays, treated the factory as their home, and went wherever they were needed. They inspected all the city's main transmission and distribution lines, universally strengthened security work, raised low power poles, and added new tie piles to poles with unstable foundations. In early August, the positions of more than 100 transformers in the city were also raised. Workers from the city's five line maintenance sections set out on patrols almost every day. Many people's feet were swollen or developed blisters due to working in the water for long periods, but they only agreed to simple treatment and continued to join the battle.
    To ensure that the people of the city could drink clean tap water, the workers at the Hankou Water Plant also raised the filter tanks, which were not high enough, by five Chinese inches and recoated the original clear water reservoir with cement to prevent sewage from seeping in. They also built and raised 50 public tap water stations in the city.
    The employees of Wuhan's power plants and water plants also actively participated in the flood control efforts of their respective plants. Each plant established flood control organizations, and during the most intense period of flood control in July, more than 1,000 people were repairing and protecting the levees of their plants every day. Currently, the levees of each plant have been raised several times to reach about 30.5 meters, and each plant has two to three lines of defense. The plants have also prepared hundreds of horsepower of pumps, organized strong rescue teams, and prepared sufficient rescue equipment. For more than a month, the workers have calmly persisted in safe production and successfully completed the task of supplying water and electricity to the city as usual. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Residents of various streets and female students from schools in Wuhan organized flood control service teams of more than 34,000 people, taking turns serving the flood control personnel. Regardless of storms or scorching sun, they were with the heroic flood control personnel, tirelessly washing clothes and delivering tea for them. Some street service teams also helped with cooking and delivering meals. The female students' service teams also launched comfort activities on the levees. Some students, led by teachers, took turns to serve on the more distant levees, at the soil extraction sites, and at the quarries.
    Soldiers and workers participating in flood control often found that their clothes, soaked with sweat and mud, had been washed clean, spread out, folded, and placed back where they were, deeply moved. Students from Wuhan No. 1 Normal School, No. 5 Girls' Middle School, and No. 1 Girls' Middle School often mended the flood control heroes' clothes neatly. The street service teams were even more active. They not only ensured a constant supply of tea on the levees but also paid close attention to adjusting the temperature of the tea according to the hot and cold weather, or boiled some salt water or ginger water for the flood control army to escape the heat and cold. The Shanghai Street service team paid special attention to hygiene, and tea cups were generally washed after each use. The Yiyuan Street service team also had warm water and towels at the tea station for flood control personnel to wipe off sweat.
    The enthusiasm of the student service teams was particularly high. They were active on the muddy construction sites all day long. Many people rubbed their hands raw while washing clothes but still washed with force. After washing the clothes, they also compiled flood control knowledge and the model deeds of the flood control army into clapper talks and crosstalk, which they performed for the soldiers and workers during their breaks. On July 29, several dangerous situations occurred at Zhanggong Levee and Xiaozhanggong Levee. Service team members from Wuhan No. 5 Girls' Middle School and No. 3 Girls' Middle School automatically participated in the rescue, and no one could persuade them to stop. Xiao Ailing, a student from No. 3 Girls' Middle School, saw the burlap sacks piled up by her classmates being swept away by the giant waves, so she jumped into the water without hesitation and used her body to hold the burlap sacks. On this day, the teachers and students of No. 3 Girls' Middle School stayed from more than six o'clock in the morning until one or two o'clock in the afternoon, and no one was willing to go back to eat.

    武汉市水电工人克服种种困难，保证了防汛用电和全市水、电的照常供应。
    防汛开始，全市堤防前线需电很急。武汉冶电业局和中南电业工程公司的线路工人，为了及时供应武汉市北郊张公堤上新建抽水机站的用电和修堤的照明用电，曾不分日夜地迅速地架设了两条长达三十五公里的输电线路。在架设线路时，工人们采用合式流水作业法加快了施工速度。有时积水淹没了整个下身，浑身都溅满了泥浆，有时倾盆大雨，有时又烈日当空，但他们始终坚持工作，在五、六天内就把两条新线路架设完成。工人们并为新建抽水机站及时安装了二百八十多部马达，使得大批抽水机能够迅速开动起来。照平常一部马达要装一个起动开关，但当时起动开关不够，如果往返购买就要延迟安装时间。技术员盛希垚就提出改用一个起动开关带动多台马达的办法解决了这个困难，并为国家节约开支达二十多亿元。
    线路工人们从六月底到现在从没有休息过一天。他们放弃了星期日，以厂为家，那里什么时候需要就往那里去。他们检查了全市所有的主要输配电线路，普遍加强了保安工作，低矮的电杆加高了，基础不巩固的电杆加了新的绑木桩。八月上旬，全市一百多座变压器的位置也升高了。全市五个线路维护段的工人，几乎每天都不断地出发巡查。不少人由于长期在水里工作，双脚已红肿或长起水疮，但是他们只肯作简单的治疗，仍然继续投入战斗。
    汉口水厂的工人为了保证全市人民饮用到洁净的自来水，也把高度不够的滤池加高了五公寸，把原有清水库重新涂上水泥，以免污水浸入。他们还在市内新建和升高了五十座公共自来水站。
    武汉市各发电厂和水厂职工并都积极参加本厂的防汛斗争。各厂都成立了防汛组织，七月间在防汛最紧张时，每天都有一千多人在修筑和保卫着本厂的堤防。目前各厂的堤防经过几度加高都达到了三十点五公尺左右，而且每个厂都有二道到三道防线，厂内还准备了几百匹马力的抽水机，组织了强有力的抢险队，准备了足够的抢险器材。一个多月来，工人们沉着地坚持着安全生产，出色地完成了照常供应全市水、电的任务。　（新华社）

    武汉市各个街道居民和学校的女学生组成三万四千多人的防汛服务队，轮流为防汛人员服务。她们无论狂风暴雨或烈日直射，都和英雄的防汛人员在一起，不辞辛苦地为防汛人员洗衣服、送茶水。有的街道服务队还帮助做饭、送饭。女学生们的服务队还在堤防上展开慰问活动。有的学生在教师率领下，轮流到较远的堤上，到取土场、采石场等地住下来服务。
    参加防汛的部队战士和工人回到住地，常常发现他们换下的浸透汗水和污泥的衣服已经被洗干净，铺好、叠好、放在原处，深受感动。武汉第一师范、第五女中、第一女中等校的学生们，经常给防汛英雄们把衣服补钉整齐。街道的服务队更为积极。她们不但保证堤上不断茶水，而且很注意根据气候热冷调节茶水温度，或者烧些盐开水、姜水给防汛大军避暑、解寒。上海街服务队特别注意卫生，茶杯每用过一次，一般都洗净后再用。一元街服务队还在茶水站设有温水和毛巾准备防汛人员揩汗。
    学生服务队的热情特别高。她们整天活跃在泥泞的工地上。很多人洗衣服把手搓破了仍旧用力洗。她们在洗完衣服后，还把防汛常识和防汛大军中的模范事迹编成快板、相声，在战士们、工人们休息时演唱起来。七月二十九日，张公堤和小张公堤有好几处发生险情。武汉第五女中和第三女中的服务队员自动参加了抢险，谁也劝不住她们。第三女中学生萧爱玲，看见同学们堆起的麻包被巨浪卷走了，就奋不顾身地跳到水中，用身子抵住麻包。这一天第三女中师生们从早晨六点多钟一直坚守到下午一两点钟谁也不肯回去吃饭。　（新华社）
