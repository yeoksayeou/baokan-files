The Shanghai Municipal People's Government, in accordance with the state's policy of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and at the request of capitalists, approved another 106 private factories in August to be converted into joint public-private enterprises. To date, 223 private factories in Shanghai have been transformed into the advanced form of state capitalism.

Since liberation, most of Shanghai's private industries have implemented processing orders, sales contracts, and procurement. Their main products, such as cotton yarn, cement, tires, rubber shoes, fountain pens, and enamelware, are now entirely purchased and sold by the state, and are systematically supplied to meet the needs of various parts of the country. These private industries have initially accepted socialist transformation. Since the state put forward the general task for the transition period, Shanghai's private industries have begun to develop in batches and with a focus on the advanced form of state capitalism. In the first half of this year, 60 private factories were converted into joint public-private enterprises, exceeding the total of the past four years (57). Due to the change in production relations and the leading position of socialist components, these joint public-private factories have changed their capitalist mode of operation, resulting in significant changes in production capacity and the enterprises themselves compared to before the joint venture.

So far, after studying the state's general task for the transition period, discussing the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and being encouraged by the advantages of joint public-private factories, more than 1,000 large-scale private factories in Shanghai have applied for joint public-private ownership.

The news that the Shanghai Municipal People's Government recently approved another 106 private factories to be converted into joint public-private enterprises in the second half of this year has spread. The employees of these factories are welcoming the new era of the factories' development towards the advanced form of state capitalism with the slogan and action of "doing a good job in production and welcoming joint management."

    上海市又批准一批私营工厂实行公私合营
    上海市人民政府根据国家对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的政策和资本家的请求，于八月份继续批准了一百零六个私营工厂实行公私合营。至此，上海市已有二百二十三个私营工厂先后转入国家资本主义的高级形式。
    解放以来，上海市私营工业已大部实行加工订货，包销、收购，其主要产品如纱布、水泥、轮胎、胶鞋、金笔、搪瓷品等，已全部为国家统购、包销，有计划地供应全国各地的需要。这些私营工业已初步接受了社会主义改造。自从国家在过渡时期总任务提出后，上海市私营工业开始成批地而又有重点地向国家资本主义的高级形式发展，今年上半年即有六十个私营工厂实行公私合营，超过了过去四年的总和（五十七个）。这些公私合营工厂，由于生产关系改变，社会主义成份居于领导地位，改变了资本主义的经营方式，因而生产能力和企业本身都比合营前有显著变化。
    到目前为止，上海市私营工商业者经过国家在过渡时期总任务的学习、中华人民共和国宪法草案的讨论以及受到了公私合营厂优越性的鼓舞，已有一千多个规模较大的私营工厂申请公私合营。
    上海市人民政府最近又批准一百零六个私营工厂在今年下半年实行公私合营的消息传出后，这些工厂的职工，正以“搞好生产，迎接合营”的口号和行动，来迎接工厂向国家资本主义高级形式发展的新时期。　（本报上海记者站）
