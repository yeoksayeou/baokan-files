    In Anhui Province's Yangtze River Flood Control and Embankment Protection Struggle,
    Many Heroic Divers Have Emerged
    In the struggle to prevent floods and protect embankments along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province, many heroic divers have emerged. The eight members of Cha Huaiqing's diving team in Maqiao Township, Huaining County, are typical of these many divers.
    Cha Huaiqing's diving team has no diving equipment. The members only rely on their knowledge of swimming and hold their breath to dive into the water to scout for leaks. On July 8th, seepage was discovered on the inner slope of the siphon pipe section of the Guangji Embankment. After research by engineering technicians, it was necessary to check underwater for leaks. Cha Huaiqing's diving team accepted this task. The river water outside the siphon pipe embankment was more than twenty feet deep. Without any diving equipment, it was indeed a difficult task for the divers to dive to the bottom and squat there. However, the members of Cha Huaiqing's diving team overcame these difficulties and dived to the bottom to find the leaks. They groped underwater for a few minutes, then came up for air before diving back in. The water more than twenty feet deep was quite cold. The divers had to come up to warm themselves by the fire and drink some liquor after working in the deep water for a while before going down again. The members of Cha Huaiqing's diving team worked like this for two or three hours and finally identified the cause of the seepage.
    In the half-month since its organization, Cha Huaiqing's diving team has identified many leaks in several dangerous embankment sections. Because they dived into the water to scout for leaks regardless of their own safety, they provided reliable information for flood control and rescue work, enabling the timely discovery and plugging of leaks in many dangerous embankment sections, turning danger into safety for the embankments.

    在安徽省长江防汛护堤斗争中
    出现了许多英勇的潜水手
    在安徽省长江的防汛护堤斗争中，出现了许多英勇的潜水手。怀宁县马桥乡查怀清潜水队的八个队员，就是这许多潜水手中的典型。
    查怀清潜水队，没有任何的潜水工具，只凭队员们懂得一些水性，屏住一口气潜入水中侦察漏洞。七月八日，广济圩江堤虹吸管堤段内坡发现渗水，经过工程技术人员的研究，需要到水底下检查是否有漏洞。查怀清潜水队便接受了这个任务。虹吸管堤外面的江水，足有两丈多深，没有任何潜水工具的潜水手们，要潜到水底并且在水底蹲住，确实是一件很艰难的事情。但是，查怀清潜水队的队员们克服了这些困难，潜到水底寻找漏洞。他们在水底下摸索几分钟，就钻出水面换一口气，再潜入水中。两丈多深的江水底下是相当寒冷的。潜水手们在深水中工作一会儿，就得上来烤一气火，喝上点烧酒再下去。查怀清潜水队的队员们就这样工作了两、三个钟头，终于查明了渗水的原因。
    查怀清潜水队，组织起来的半个月中，已在几处险工堤段上摸出许多漏洞。由于他们奋不顾身地潜入水中侦察漏洞，给防汛抢险工作提供了可靠的情况，使不少险工堤段上的漏洞能够及时地发现并堵塞住，堤防转危为安。 （新华社）
