In Hubei Province, non-disaster areas are enthusiastically launching an over-production campaign. Currently, various localities are seizing the opportunity to carry out large-scale wasteland reclamation in drylands, and rushing to plant, replant, and intercrop late-autumn crops. Before the beginning of autumn, all counties in the Xiangyang Special District launched a week-long crash campaign of replanting and rush planting. The Enshi Special District has already completed 80% of its over-production plan. In Xicheng Township, Jingshan County, mutual aid groups led by the Party branch secretary are at the core, mobilizing mutual aid groups throughout the township to divide responsibilities, contract tasks, and lead individual farmers. In six or seven days, they replanted and rush-planted over 800 mu. Macheng County has reclaimed over 21,000 mu of virgin land.

While carrying out the over-production campaign, various localities are also vigorously engaged in manure accumulation and weeding. In Macheng County, over 50% of the cotton fields have been top-dressed, and oil crops and cotton throughout the county have generally been hoed once.

To ensure the comprehensive development of the campaign, various localities have widely organized visits, evaluations, and competitions. Cadres in the Sixth Village of Houzhuang Township, Cihe District, Gucheng County, were originally complacent. After the township organized over 200 people for evaluation and visits, they discovered that the village still had 25 mu of weedy fields. Village cadres immediately led the masses in weeding and protecting seedlings. After evaluation and visits, Huopai Township, Xiangyang County, promoted seedling transplantation throughout the township.

In terms of technical guidance, various localities have trained a large number of technical personnel. In the Huanggang Special District, each county has over 1,200 people capable of technical instruction. Xiangyang County adopted on-the-spot instruction, teaching and doing at the same time, allowing the masses to learn and test simultaneously, with good results.

Farmers in the Yichang Special District did not have the habit of cultivating regenerative rice in the past. In addition to sending technical cadres to the special district to strengthen technical guidance, the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture specially invited Feng Dingyu from Xishui County, who has experience in cultivating regenerative rice, to the special district to teach cultivation techniques.

In order to complete the plan of increasing production by 42.3% in non-disaster areas this autumn, Feixi County, Anhui Province, requires the county to cultivate regenerative rice on an area of over 666,000 mu. This year, some polder areas in Feixi County were flooded. In order to strive for more grain, in mid-July, the Feixi County Party Committee convened a meeting of district party committee secretaries from thirteen non-disaster areas, proposing to increase grain production in non-disaster areas by more than 41 million jin through methods such as replanting and cultivating regenerative rice, requiring the county to cultivate 73,500 mu of regenerative rice. In early August, the county party committee re-examined and studied the previous plan for increasing production, believing that the potential for further increasing production in the county was still very great. In addition to early and late rice, 60% of the more than one million mu of mid-season rice fields in the county can be used to grow regenerative rice. Therefore, the county party committee decided to increase the area of regenerative rice by another 593,000 mu. If each mu of regenerative rice yields an average of 80 jin, the county's more than 666,000 mu of regenerative rice can increase production by more than 53 million jin of rice. According to this spirit, the second re-production plan, formulated to increase production by more than 180 million jin.

In order to ensure the realization of this production increase plan, on August 12, the county party committee convened a meeting of county, district, and township cadres, making an emergency mobilization; and dispatched more than 60 cadres to go deep into various townships to widely publicize the policies of increasing production without increasing taxes and rewarding over-production, and implement the methods of increasing production by growing regenerative rice; at the same time, it also mobilized 40 to 50 farmers from polder areas to go to non-disaster areas that lack experience in growing regenerative rice to teach the methods of growing regenerative rice and help mobilize farmers in non-disaster areas to participate in the over-production campaign.

    湖北省非灾区全面展开超额增产运动
    安徽省肥西县动员农民培育再生稻六十多万亩
    湖北省非灾区热烈展开超额增产运动，现在各地正抓紧时机大规模地进行旱地开荒、抢种、补种、套种晚秋作物。襄阳专区各县在立秋前都开展了补种、抢种的突击运动周，恩施专区已完成超额增产计划的百分之八十。京山县西城乡以党支部书记领导的互助组为核心，发动全乡互助组，分工包干带动单干农民，六、七天即补种、抢种八百余亩。麻城县已开生荒地二万一千多亩。
    各地在展开超额增产运动同时也大力进行积肥和除草工作。麻城县百分之五十以上的棉田都施了追肥，全县油料作物和棉花已普遍加锄一次。
    为使运动全面展开，各地普遍组织了参观评比竞赛，谷城县茨河区后庄乡第六村干部原来麻痹自满，经过全乡组织二百多人评比参观后，发现该村还有荒草田二十五亩。村干部立即领导群众锄草保苗。襄阳县火牌乡经过评比参观，推动了全乡移苗工作。
    在技术指导上，各地都训练了大批技术人员。黄冈专区各县能进行技术传授的有一千二百多人。襄阳县采用田间传授，边教边作，群众边学边试，收效很好。
    宜昌专区农民过去没有培育再生稻的习惯，湖北省农业厅除了派技术干部到该专区加强技术指导外，特邀请浠水县培育再生稻有经验的冯定郁到该专区传授培育技术。

    安徽省肥西县为完成非灾区今秋增产百分之四十二点三的计划，要求全县培育再生稻面积六十六万六千多亩。今年肥西县部分圩区水稻受淹。为了争取多打粮食，七月中旬，中共肥西县委召开了十三个非灾区的区委书记会议，提出通过覆种、培养再生稻等办法，在非灾区再增产四千一百多万斤粮食，要求全县养再生稻七万三千五百亩。八月上旬，县委又检查研究了上次再增产计划，认为全县再增产的潜力还很大。全县除早、晚稻外，在一百多万亩中熟稻中，有百分之六十的稻田可养再生稻。因此，县委决定再增加五十九万三千多亩再生稻的面积。如每亩再生稻平均收八十斤，全县六十六万六千多亩再生稻，即可增产五千三百多万斤稻子。根据这一精神制订的第二次再增产计划，共可增产一亿八千多万斤。
    为了保证这一增产计划的实现，八月十二日，县委召开了县、区、乡三级干部会议，作了紧急动员；并且抽派了六十多名干部深入各乡，广泛宣传增产不增税、奖励超额增产的政策，贯彻养再生稻的增产办法；同时还动员了四、五十名圩区农民到缺乏养再生稻经验的非灾区，传授养再生稻的方法，帮助动员非灾区农民投入超额增产运动。
