Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 10th: After two years of large-scale geological exploration, the reserve and quality of iron ore, dolomite, and other materials needed by Anshan Iron and Steel (An'gang) in the future have been investigated and clarified. The discovery and planned exploitation of these essential minerals for the steel industry will provide important conditions for the further development of China's steel industry. Preliminary results of the exploration confirm that the mountains surrounding the "Steel Capital" are treasures containing various minerals. The iron ore is not only abundant in reserves but also has a lower phosphorus and sulfur content than is rare in other iron mines, which can be used to refine the best pig iron. At the same time, the iron ore layers are very thick, and a large portion is distributed above ground level, making large-scale open-pit mining possible. Reserves of non-metallic minerals such as dolomite, clay, and silica, which are indispensable to the steel industry, are also considerable.

The geological exploration work of An'gang over the past two years has been carried out in a relatively planned and prepared manner, and has received great help from Soviet experts. Soviet experts provided a series of specific suggestions from exploration methods, construction management, sampling and testing to geological summary, and helped solve many complex technical problems.

Xinhua News Agency: Anshan Iron and Steel Company is making full preparations for the reconstruction project of the Dagushan Iron Mine this year. The reconstruction of this iron mine is mainly to meet the growing needs of iron and steel production at An'gang. Currently, more than 1,000 workers from four engineering companies—mining, electrical installation, industrial piping, and metal structure installation—are participating in the construction preparation work at the construction site. The huge general step-down substation that supplies power for the production of mining and ore dressing plants at Dagushan, began construction as early as June this year. At present, the foundations for the iron tower project for erecting high-voltage power lines have been more than half completed. Semi-permanent projects such as temporary substations, cement mixing plants, wood formwork and steel bar processing plants, construction machinery repair shops, and mechanical pre-installation yards for comprehensive construction are being built or mechanical equipment installed. Soon, the construction project of the Dagushan Iron Mine will begin in full swing.

This month, the crushing and screening yard in the Dagushan Iron Mine is about to start the technically complex prop (pillar) replacement base (foundation) project, and projects such as the lubricating oil depot and ventilation fan room will also be carried out simultaneously. The construction workers are now studying construction measures with Soviet experts. The blasting of the foundations of old ball mills, magnetic separators, and other equipment in the ore dressing plant building began in June, and preparations are now actively underway to pour new equipment foundations.

    鞍山勘探出丰富铁矿资源
    大孤山铁矿改建工程今年将进行全面施工
    据新华社鞍山十日电：经过两年来规模浩大的地质勘探，鞍钢今后需要的铁矿石、白云石等的储量及质量情况已经调查清楚。这些钢铁工业中必不可少的重要矿产的探明和有计划的开采，将为进一步发展我国钢铁工业提供了重要条件。勘探的初步结果证实：钢都四周的群山，是一座座蕴藏着各种矿物的宝库。铁矿石不但储量丰富，而且矿石中含磷和硫之少，为其他铁矿中所罕有，可以炼制最好的生铁。同时，铁矿层很厚，并有极大一部分分布在地平面以上，可以进行大规模露天开采。钢铁工业不可缺少的白云石、粘土、矽石等非金属矿物，储量也极为可观。
    鞍钢两年来的地质勘探工作，是在比较有计划、有准备的情况下进行的，并得到了苏联专家的巨大帮助。苏联专家从勘探方法、施工管理、采样化验到地质总结，都提出了一系列的具体建议，并帮助解决了许多复杂的技术问题。
    据新华社讯：鞍山钢铁公司正在为今年改建的大孤山铁矿工程进行全面施工准备工作。这个铁矿工程的改建，主要是为了满足鞍钢炼铁和炼钢生产日益发展的需要。目前在工地上参加施工准备工作的，有矿山、电气安装、工业管道和金属结构安装等四个工程公司的一千多个职工。供应大孤山采矿、选矿厂等生产用电的巨大的总降压变电所，早在今年六月间就动工了。目前，架设高压电线的铁塔工程的基础已完成了一多半。为全面施工用的临时变电所、水泥搅拌场、木模钢筋加工场、施工机械修理场、机械预安装场等半永久性工程，正在加紧建筑或安装机械设备。不久，大孤山铁矿的建设工程就要全面开始了。
    大孤山铁矿中的破碎筛分场这个月就要开始技术复杂的托柱（子）换基（础）工程，润滑油库、通风机室等工程也将同时施工。现在施工人员们正和苏联专家研究施工措施。选矿厂厂房内旧的球磨机、磁选机等设备基础，在六月间就开始了爆破工作，现在正积极准备浇灌新的设备基础。
