    Warriors Guarding the Pamir Plateau
    Wu Jibin

    This spring, I followed the delegation of the National People's Comfort Mission to the People's Liberation Army to the Pamir Plateau and met the soldiers guarding the frontier of the motherland there. The Pamir Plateau is known as the "Roof of the World," with a particularly high altitude and ice and snow everywhere. This place presents unimaginable difficulties to the soldiers, such as extreme cold and thin air. But the soldiers used their revolutionary will and the loyal hearts of people's soldiers to overcome all difficulties and guard the frontier of the motherland like iron men.

    There was a squad leader named Hu Zhongxuan, who is a Communist Party member. When he and his comrades first arrived at the frontier, the strong winds on the plateau blew layers of black skin off their faces, and their lips cracked and bled. These were not difficulties in the eyes of the soldiers, but rather added material for laughter and jokes to the optimistic soldiers. The biggest difficulty was the thin air, which caused everyone to feel dizzy and bloated. Climbing a small slope of a few dozen meters required several rests, and they couldn't catch their breath. Because of the low air pressure, the rice was often undercooked. The soldiers mostly had diarrhea from eating half-cooked food. But the soldiers said, "It doesn't matter! The troops stationed here before have experience. Coming here means shedding some skin and having an upset stomach for a week. Just hold on for a few days and it will be fine." The soldiers were busy standing guard and patrolling, and busy tidying up the barracks. Hu Zhongxuan led his comrades to practice climbing mountains. They climbed to the top of the mountain with difficulty, gasping for breath, and then slid down along the snow, and then climbed up again. After practicing like this for more than a month, their lung capacity increased; they overcame the difficulties, and now they are all running like tigers in the mountains.

    Grass is extremely important for their border-guarding unit. Each of them has a horse, and they need a lot of grass every day. The soldiers saw grass in the wetlands, and it was very lush; but the water had already frozen with a thin layer of ice. Once, Hu Zhongxuan was holding a large sickle, staring at the lush grass in the water in a daze. "We can't do without horse grass!" Thinking of this, he resolutely jumped into the icy water. His comrades also jumped into the icy water with him. They endured the biting cold, singing songs, and swinging their large sickles with all their might. When they completed the task of cutting horse grass, harsh winter descended here. It snowed every day. Many places had snowdrifts a meter deep. And every day after noon, the wind would blow, and the strong wind would blow sand and rocks everywhere. A teacup of boiling water would freeze in five minutes. In such a climate, Hu Zhongxuan and his comrades patrolled the border day and night. Whenever they went out to perform tasks, they looked like snowmen. When they were hungry, they would take a bite of cold baked pancake; when they were thirsty, they would swallow a mouthful of snow. The wind and snow were vast, and the roads were difficult to identify. Sometimes they and their horses would roll into snow pits; sometimes, they and their horses would fall into ice holes. One night, Hu Zhongxuan's horse fell in the rocks, and his head was broken, but Hu Zhongxuan ignored the wound, grabbed a handful of snow, rubbed his frozen hands warm, and rode his horse forward again. The weather was so cold, and the wind and snow were so heavy, but when Hu Zhongxuan and his comrades were on guard duty on the border at night, they did not put down their fur hats to cover their ears, nor did they crawl into the fortifications where they could take shelter from the wind; because this way they could see farther and hear more clearly, and even the most cunning enemy would find it difficult to escape their eyes.

    Every people's soldier on the frontier is aware of the importance of their responsibility. They said, "We are the eyes and ears of the motherland, the guards of the people. We must be responsible to the people of the motherland." They are fulfilling the provisions of Article 20 of the Draft Constitution. For this, they can endure any hardship, and they will overcome any difficulty. Soldier Wang Xingchen became ill as soon as he arrived here. The leaders of the troops asked him to stay down the mountain to rest, but he kept thinking, "I came here to guard the frontier of the motherland, how can I squat down and rest?" So he crossed a big mountain to carry firewood, steamed the frozen steamed buns, and then he walked through more than a foot of snow, bringing boiling water and hot steamed buns up the mountain, so that his comrades could eat hot steamed buns and drink hot water on the snowy mountain peaks.

    In order to protect the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to protect the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, they are fighting against wind, snow, and severe cold on this long border line. Every soldier is like Hu Zhongxuan and Wang Xingchen, cast of steel. The strong wind cannot knock them down, and the heavy snow cannot bury them. They only think about the importance of their duties. The promulgation of the Draft Constitution has further encouraged them, and they will contribute even greater strength and wisdom.

    守卫在帕米尔高原上的战士们
    吴济滨
    今年春天我随全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团到了帕米尔高原，会见了在那里守卫着祖国边疆的战士们。帕米尔高原是被人们称为世界屋脊的地方，地势特别高，到处都是冰雪。这地方给战士们的是不可想像的寒冷和空气稀薄等困难。但战士们用革命的毅力，用人民战士忠贞的心，把一切困难都战胜了，像铁人一样地守卫着祖国的边疆。
    有一位叫胡忠宣的班长，是共产党员。当他和他的战友们初到边疆时，高原上的狂风吹得他们的脸一层又一层地脱着黑皮，嘴唇裂着血口。这些在战士的心目中不是困难，而是给乐观的战士们增加了说笑的资料。最大的困难是空气稀薄，个个都头昏肚胀，爬几十公尺的小山坡就要歇几次，喘不过气来。因为气压低，饭往往煮不熟。战士们因吃半生不熟的东西，大都泻肚子。但是战士们说：“没关系！以前驻守在这里的部队有经验了，到这里来是要脱脱皮，换一星期的肚子，坚持几天就好了。”战士们忙着去站岗放哨，忙着整理营房。胡忠宣带领着同志们锻炼爬山。他们艰难地喘息着爬上山头，然后顺着积雪滑下来，再往上爬。这样练了一个多月，他们的肺活量增大了；他们战胜了困难，现在他们都像猛虎般地奔跑在山间。
    马草对他们这支守卫边疆的部队来说，极为重要。他们每人一匹马，每天需要大量的草。战士们看到水地里有草，并且非常茂密；但水已经结了一层薄冰。有一次胡忠宣拿着大镰刀，望着水地里茂密的草出神了。“没有马草是不成的 ！”他想到这里，毅然地跳到冰水里。他的战友们也都跟他跳进冰水里。他们忍受着刺骨的寒凉，唱着歌，拼全身力气抡动着大镰刀。当他们完成了打马草的任务以后，严冬就在这里降临了。每天都下雪。许多地方都有一公尺深的积雪。并且每天一过中午就刮风，狂风吹得沙石乱飞。一茶缸开水，五分钟就冻结了。就在这样的气候里，胡忠宣和他的战友们昼夜不停地巡逻在国境线上。每当他们出去执行任务，就活像一个雪人。饿了，他们就啃一口冰冷的烙饼；渴了就吞一口雪。风雪漫漫，道路很难识别，有时他们连人带马滚到雪窝子里；有时，连人带马掉进冰窟里。一天夜里，胡忠宣的马在乱石中摔倒了，他的头摔破了一块，但胡忠宣没管伤口，抓一把雪搓热了他那已经冻僵了的手，又骑上马前进。天气那样冷，风雪又那样大，但当夜里在国境线上放哨时，胡忠宣和他的战友们一样，都不把皮帽放下盖住耳朵，也不钻进可以避风的工事里；因为这样可以看得远，听得清，再狡猾的敌人也难躲过他们的眼睛。
    边疆上的每一个人民战士，都意识到自己责任的重大。他们说：“我们是祖国的耳目，人民的警卫员。我们要对祖国人民负责。”他们在履行着宪法草案第二十条的规定。为了这，什么苦他们也能忍受，什么困难也要被他们战胜。战士王兴臣，一到这里就病了。部队首长让他留在山下休息，但他一直想：“我是来守卫祖国边疆的，怎么能蹲着休息呢？”于是他翻过一个大山去背柴火，蒸好冻成冰块的馒头，然后他又徒步走过一尺多深的积雪，把开水和热馒头送上山去，使同志们在冰雪的山巅能吃上热呼呼的馒头，喝上热呼呼的水。
    为了保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整，他们就在这漫长的国境线上和风雪、严寒斗争着。每个战士都和胡忠宣、王兴臣一样，像钢铁铸成的，狂风吹不倒他们，大雪埋不住他们。他们只想着他们职责的重大。宪法草案的公布更鼓舞了他们，他们将贡献出更大的力量和智慧。
