Jiangsu and Hunan Organize Medical Personnel to Work in Flood Control Areas
The Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Health Department has organized medical personnel to go deep into flood control and drainage areas and disaster areas to carry out health and medical work.

Five health work teams, composed of more than 100 medical workers from medical units directly under the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Health Department, have taken large quantities of medicines to flood control construction sites and disaster areas. Each small team of each work team also carries microscopes and other medical equipment. Recently, more than 1,300 medical personnel from 24 cities and counties, including Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangning, and Wuxi, have formed more than 130 mobile medical teams and medical groups to go deep into river dikes and flood control construction sites to carry out prevention work. Many private Chinese and Western medicine practitioners also actively and enthusiastically participated in this work.

These medical workers, carrying medicine kits and braving heavy rain, traveled on the dikes and riverbanks, providing first aid and treatment while publicizing hygiene knowledge. Twenty-four medical workers from public medical institutions and private practitioners in Rugao County went door-to-door by boat to deliver medicine powder for treating foot rot to farmers in water-affected areas, curing many farmers' foot rot. The farmers reflected: In the past, during floods, the reactionary government did not care about our lives, but now the People's Government sends doctors to our door to deliver medicine. The People's Government is truly our people's government. The No. 1 District Health Center in Nanjing City, in order to ensure the safety of women and infants, concentrated pregnant women and placed them in safe areas. The health center checked their bodies and took care of them very carefully. In the past month, 51 pregnant women have successfully given birth to children. One mother, Zhu Lan's, recalled that when she gave birth during the floods before liberation, she was immersed in water all day long and no one cared about her, so she suffered from postpartum illness. Now, she is deeply touched by the deep concern of the People's Government. (Xinhua News Agency)

In late June, the Hunan Provincial Health Department organized more than 200 doctors, medical assistants, nurses, and midwives from more than 20 units, including the Hunan Medical College in Changsha, the Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, and the Changsha Municipal Hospital, into 23 teams. Carrying large quantities of medicines and epidemic prevention and disinfection equipment, they went to the flood-stricken areas along the lakes and rivers in Wangcheng and Xiangyin in the Xiangtan Special District, and Huarong and Nanxian in the Changde Special District, to help the people in the disaster areas carry out health, epidemic prevention, and first aid work.

After these medical teams arrived in the disaster areas, they worked under the unified guidance of the local flood control headquarters, striving to "provide medical treatment when there is illness and send medicine when it is needed" without delaying the life of a single patient. In some counties in the Xiangtan Special District, the local health and medical institutions were used as the backbone to ensure that there was an average of one health worker in each township. General disaster areas have carried out drinking water disinfection and drug disinfection work. In Xiangyin County, in addition to carrying out drinking water disinfection and mobilizing the affected people to sign disease prevention covenants, more than ten cleaners were also organized to collect feces, and everyone was educated not to dump feces into rivers and lakes at will to ensure the cleanliness of the drinking water for the people in the disaster areas. The medical personnel from Hunan Medical College personally divided the disinfectant bleaching powder into small packages according to fixed amounts and distributed them to the masses, teaching everyone how to carry out drinking water disinfection work. The medical team members shared joys and sorrows with the people in the disaster areas, and their enthusiasm for work was very high. In some places, they still insisted on working in small buildings when the flood was as high as the roof; they braved the rain at night to deliver babies for the victims; and sometimes they waded through the water to diagnose and treat the victims. As a result of their hard work, the incidence of disease among the masses in the disaster areas has been significantly reduced. In Ninghuzui, Yiyang, 33 patients were diagnosed on July 15, but by July 23, the number had dropped to only 5.

The people in the disaster areas are deeply grateful to the government for sending a large number of medical personnel to the disaster areas in a timely manner. The affected people in Qingfeng Mountain, Wangcheng No. 2 District, reflected: After we suffered disaster, the government not only took us to the shore, but also delivered babies for us; and medical treatment is free. If it were during the reactionary government period, we would only die of drowning, starvation, or disease. (Our Hunan Reporter Station)

    江苏湖南组织医务人员到防汛地区工作
    江苏省人民政府卫生厅组织医务工作人员深入防汛排涝地区和受灾地区开展卫生医疗工作。
    由江苏省人民政府卫生厅直属医疗单位中的一百多个医务工作者组成的五个卫生工作大队，已携带大批药品分赴防汛工地和水灾地区。每个工作大队的每一小队并带有显微镜及其它医疗器械。最近，南京、镇江、江宁、无锡等二十四个市、县已有一千三百多个医务工作人员组成一百三十多个巡回医疗队和医疗组深入江堤和防汛工地开展预防工作。很多私人开业的中、西医师也积极地热情地参加了这一工作。
    这些医务工作者背着药箱、冒着大雨，奔走在江堤、河堤上，一面进行救护、治疗工作，一面宣传卫生常识。如皋县公立医疗机构的医务工作者和私人开业医师二十四人，分头用小船把治烂脚用的药粉挨户送到水患地区的农民家里，治好了很多农民的烂脚病。农民反映：解放前闹水灾，反动政府不管我们死活，现在人民政府还派医师送药上门，人民政府真正是我们老百姓的政府。南京市一区卫生所为了保障妇女和婴儿的安全，把孕妇集中起来安置在安全地区。卫生所替她们检查身体，照料得很周到。一个月来已有五十一个孕妇顺利地生下了孩子。有一个产妇叫朱兰氏，她回想起解放前闹水灾的那年她生孩子时，整天泡在水里无人过问，因而患了月子病。现在她受到人民政府的深切的关注，使她非常感动。（新华社）
    湖南省卫生厅于六月下旬，组织长沙市湖南医学院、湖南省人民医院、市立长沙医院等二十多个单位的医师、医士、护士、助产员二百多人，分成二十三个队，携带大批药品和防疫消毒器材到滨湖沿江地区的湘潭专区的望城、湘阴，常德专区的华容、南县等县水灾区，帮助灾区人民进行卫生防疫急救工作。
    这些医疗队到达灾区后，在当地防汛指挥部统一指导下进行工作，努力做到“有病就医，要药就送上”，不误一个病人的生命。湘潭专区有些县，以当地卫生医疗机构为骨干，做到平均每乡有一个卫生员。一般灾民区都进行了饮水消毒和药物消毒工作。湘阴县城镇，除进行饮水消毒和动员受灾群众订立疾病预防公约外，还组织十多名清洁员，收集粪便，并教育大家不要随便将粪便倒入河湖，保证灾区人民的饮水清洁。湖南医学院去的医务人员，亲自把消毒的漂白粉按固定分量分成小包，分发给群众，教给大家进行饮水消毒工作。医疗队人员在下面和灾区人民一起共甘苦，工作热情很高。有些地方，洪水高达屋顶时，他们仍坚持在小楼上工作；夜间冒雨去为灾民接生；有时还涉水去给灾民诊病。由于他们辛勤工作的结果，灾区群众的发病率已显著降低。益阳泞湖咀七月十五日诊病者三十三人，七月二十三日即降到只有五人。
    灾区人民对政府及时派遣大批医务人员深入灾区，深为感谢。望城二区青峰山受灾群众反映：我们受了灾，政府不但把我们接到岸上来，还替我们接生；看病又不要钱。要是在反动政府时期，我们只有淹死、饿死、病死。（本报湖南记者站）
