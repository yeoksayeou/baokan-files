Newspaper Review

    The New Guizhou Daily published a news item on June 4th, titled "New Atmosphere in Production as Hulu and Shangyuan Agricultural Production Cooperatives Implement Seasonal Contract System." Implementing a seasonal contract system is indeed a good way to improve agricultural production management work at present, and it should be promoted. However, this news item from the New Guizhou Daily compared the seasonal contract system with the piece-rate system and concluded that "the piece-rate system is not as good as the seasonal contract system," which is incorrect. The piece-rate system is only a method of calculating labor; the seasonal contract system is a method of organizing labor, which also addresses the issue of calculating labor. From the perspective of calculating labor, the seasonal contract system is not as good as the piece-rate system. The piece-rate system is the most rational method of calculating labor and the most consistent with the socialist principle of distribution according to work. This is true both in theory and based on the many years of experience of the Soviet Union and the experience of some agricultural production cooperatives in our country. In fact, the method adopted for calculating labor when implementing seasonal contracts is a relatively crude form of collective piecework; its direction of improvement should be towards piece-rate work. It is completely backwards to regard piece-rate work as a low-level form and to think that it is only when "contracting cannot be done" that one is forced to "still use piece-rate work."

    Judging from the content of this news item, the reason why implementing "piece-rate work" cannot meet the production needs of these two cooperatives is not because the system itself is bad, but because when adopting the method of calculating labor using "piece-rate work," production responsibilities were not stipulated at the same time, production plans were not well-defined, or even if they were, they were not implemented, and the standards for piece-rate work were not clear. It can also be said that these two cooperatives do not yet have the fundamental conditions for implementing a piece-rate system. Alternatively, what these two cooperatives originally implemented was not actually a "piece-rate system," but merely misused the name. In this case, it is permissible to first implement a seasonal contract system and temporarily not implement piecework. However, it is incorrect to treat the seasonal contract system as a better production management method than piece-rate work in the report, and to say that the transition from piece-rate work to the seasonal contract system is a major change in the cooperative's production management.

    The news item also mentions "quota management" and regards this as the main content of seasonal contracts. This is also an abuse of the term "quota management." A "quota" generally refers to the standards of quantity and quality of various tasks that a medium-level laborer can do faithfully in one day under normal conditions. "Quota management" refers to the work related to the determination, adjustment, and inspection of "quotas." What is mentioned in the news item is clearly not a "quota," but rather the quality requirements, completion time, and work points earned for each piece of land. It is acceptable to call this "contracting standards"; calling it a "quota" confuses the meaning of the term "quota," which will cause confusion when truly adopting the "quota" method in the future.

    In the "Mutual Aid and Cooperation Symposium" reported in the Guangxi Daily on July 8th, regarding the "Promotion of Contract Work Based on Tasks," it was mentioned that the method of calculating points in one agricultural production cooperative was: "Weeding fields, cultivating corn soil, and shoveling field foundations are light work, and one labor day is calculated as eight points; carrying manure, pulling seedlings, and transplanting rice are heavy work, and one labor day is calculated as ten points. Cutting cloud ear wood is a technical job, and one labor day is calculated as twenty points." This is a misuse of the term "labor day." A labor day is a unit for calculating labor. One labor day is one labor day, and it should not have several different work points. In order to suit the habits of Chinese farmers, a labor day can also be converted into work points, that is, one labor day equals ten points. But it should not be said that one labor day can be converted into different work points; if there are twenty points, it should be counted as two labor days. Some newspapers also treat one labor day as one day of work. For example, the Yunnan Daily of July 16th, in its article "The CCP Xuanwei Huajiao Township Branch Strengthens Political and Ideological Work in Agricultural Production Cooperatives," stated: "...Calculated at 240 labor days a year, each day can be divided into 9.5 jin of grain and 2,000 yuan... currently, there are already 270 work points, and it is estimated that 90 labor days can still be achieved by the time of distribution in October..." Here, "labor day," "daily," and "work points" are all confused. In fact, one day does not necessarily earn only one labor day, and it may not even earn one labor day; similarly, working one day will result in different labor days because the nature of the work, the technology, and the complexity differ. It is also not in line with general practice to treat one labor day as one work point.

    During the transition period, many tasks are changing rapidly and have not yet been finalized, and the specific conditions in various places are also different; therefore, it should be allowed and encouraged that various places use and create diverse methods to improve the management of agricultural production cooperatives based on specific conditions, and it should also be allowed and encouraged that various places absorb the experience of other places and apply it flexibly in combination with local conditions. However, terms should not be used vaguely and inappropriately, lest the name does not match the reality. Do not think that this is just a "minor matter" of "nitpicking over nouns." If newspapers use these important terms incorrectly, the work will also be done incorrectly. Due to the low cultural level of grassroots cadres and farmers, it is inevitable that there will be phenomena of abuse or misuse of terms in practical work. However, newspaper workers have a responsibility to correct this phenomenon and should not simply repeat what others say and copy it into the newspaper; when it is necessary to report in the original way, a note should be added to indicate that the name is used incorrectly and to explain what is correct.

### 不可把术语“张冠李戴”

    不可把术语“张冠李戴”
    六月四日的新黔日报登载了一条消息，题目是“葫芦、上院两个农业生产合作社推行季节包工制生产出现新气象”。实行季节包工制确实是当前改进农业生产管理工作的好办法，是应当推行的。可是，新黔日报的这条消息把季节包工制和按件计工制加以比较，得出了“按件计工制不如季节包工制”的结论，这却是错误的。按件计工制只是计算劳动的一种办法；季节包工制则是组织劳动的一种办法，附带也解决计算劳动的问题。从计算劳动这一方面来说，季节包工是不如按件计工的。按件计工是最合理的、最符合按劳取酬的社会主义原则的计算劳动的办法。这无论从理论上说，或者从苏联多年的经验和我国一些农业生产合作社的经验来说，都是如此。实际上，实行季节包工时在计算劳动方面所采用的办法，也就是比较粗糙的集体计件；它的改进的方向应当是按件计工。把按件计工当作低级的形式，认为“不能包工的”才不得不“仍然按件计工”，就刚好弄反了。
    根据这条消息的内容来判断，实行“按件计工”之所以不能满足这两个社的生产的需要，并不是因为这个制度本身不好，而是因为采用“按件计工”的计算劳动的办法时，没有同时规定生产责任，没有订好生产计划或者订了也不执行，按件计工的标准也不明确。也可以说，这两个社还没有具备实行按件计工制的根本条件。再不然，就是这两个社原来所实行的其实并不是“按件计工制”，只不过是误用了这个名称。在这种情况下，先只实行季节包工而暂不实行计件制是可以的。可是，在报道中把季节包工当作比按件计工好的生产管理方法，而且说从按件计工到季节包工是社的生产管理上的一个重大变革，就不对了。
    这条消息里还谈到“定额管理”，把这作为季节包工的主要内容。这也是对于“定额管理”这个名称的滥用。“定额”一般地说是指一个中等劳动力在通常的条件下忠实工作一天所能做的各种工作的数量和质量的标准。“定额管理”，是指关于“定额”的确定和调整、检查等等工作而言。消息中所谈到的，显然并不是“定额”，而是每份田上的工作的质量要求、完成时间及做完这份活应得的工分。把这叫做“包工标准”是可以的；叫做“定额”，就把“定额”这个名词的涵义弄乱了，就会使将来真正采用“定额”的办法时发生混乱。
    七月八日广西日报的“推行按活包工制”的“互助合作座谈会”中，谈到一个农业生产合作社计分的办法是：“耘田、培玉米土、铲田基等是轻活，一个劳动日算八分，挑粪、拔秧、插田等是重活，一个劳动日算十分。砍云耳木是一种技术工，一个劳动日算二十分。”这样就把“劳动日”一词用错了。劳动日是计算劳动的单位，一个劳动日就是一个劳动日，是不应该有几种不同的工分的。如果为适合我国农民的习惯，也可以把劳动日折合成工分，即一个劳动日等于十分。但不应说一个劳动日可以折算不同的工分；如果有二十分，就应该算两个劳动日。还有的报纸把一个劳动日当作工作一天。如七月十六日云南日报所载“中共宣威花椒乡支部加强农业生产合作社中的政治思想工作”一文中说：“……按一年二百四十个劳动日算每日可分九斤半粮食，二千元人民币，……现已经有二百七十个劳动工分，估计到十月分配，还可做到九十个劳动日，……”这里把“劳动日”“每日”“劳动工分”都混淆起来了。实际上，每日不一定只得一个劳动日，也可能得不到一个劳动日；同样是工作一天，因为工作的性质不同，技术不同，繁简轻重不同，是会得到不同的劳动日的。把一个劳动日当作一个劳动工分，也不合乎一般的习惯。
    在过渡时期，许多工作都在迅速变化着，还没有定型，各地的具体条件又各不相同；因此，应允许和提倡各地根据具体的条件运用和创造多种多样的办法改进农业生产合作社的管理工作，也应允许和提倡各地吸取外地的经验，结合本地的具体情况灵活运用。但是，不可似是而非地张冠李戴地搬用术语，以免名不符实。不要以为这只是“扣名词”的“小事情”。像这些重要的术语，如果报纸用得不正确，工作就也会随着做得不正确。由于基层干部和农民群众的文化水平不高，在实际工作中有滥用或误用术语的现象，这是难免的。但是，报纸工作者有责任纠正这种现象，不可人云亦云地把它照搬在报上；在不得不照原样报道时，也应该加上按语，指出那个名称用错了，说明怎样才是正确的。
