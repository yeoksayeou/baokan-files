The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Seamless Steel Tube Factory successfully trial-rolled seamless steel tubes on July 29th that were 12 percent larger than specified in the factory's technical design. This type of steel tube has great uses in construction. Because it exceeds the scope stipulated in the factory's technical design book, rolling is very difficult; for example, the position of the rolling centerline and the distance of the straightening machine rollers are the most difficult to adjust. However, thanks to the excellent Soviet machinery and equipment, and the workers' skillful mastery of the technology, this type of steel tube was finally successfully rolled. The steel tubes rolled that day passed quality inspection and met standards.

    无缝钢管厂试轧新钢管成功
    鞍钢无缝钢管厂职工，于七月二十九日试轧比该厂技术设计规定大百分之十二的无缝钢管成功。这种钢管，在建设上的用途很大。因它超出该厂技术设计书规定的范围，轧制非常困难，如轧制中心线位置、矫正机辊子距离，最难调整。但由于苏联机器设备良好，职工熟练地掌握了技术，这种钢管终于轧制成功了。当天轧制的钢管，经过检查质量合乎标准。
