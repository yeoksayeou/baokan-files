Xinhua News Agency, 31st. Under the firm protest of the Chinese people and the indignant condemnation of world opinion, two U.S. aircraft carriers that had been frantically provoking the People's Republic of China have been forced to leave the waters near Hainan Island. However, the U.S. warmongering clique, which insists on being hostile to the Chinese people, still wants to maintain a U.S. naval "attack force" in the South China Sea and is prepared to continue hostile activities against the People's Republic of China.
	The U.S. naval authorities in Washington issued a statement on the 29th, announcing that U.S. warships and aircraft "have stopped (the search for the missing British aircraft)". In this statement, the U.S. naval authorities did not dare to mention the barbarous act of aggression by U.S. naval aircraft invading our country's airspace and shooting down two of our aircraft. Instead, they shamelessly described the despicable act of aggression carried out by the U.S. Navy under the guise of carrying out a "search mission" as a "normal humanitarian action" by the U.S. Navy. According to U.S. news agencies, after the U.S. naval authorities issued the statement, the two U.S. aircraft carriers that committed the crime of aggression left the waters near Hainan Island on the 30th and returned to the U.S. naval base in Manila Bay, Philippines.
	Although the U.S. aircraft carriers have been forced to stop their current provocative actions and leave the waters near Hainan Island under the watchful eyes of the people of the world, the U.S. warmongering clique has not given up its plot to find new excuses and continue to provoke the People's Republic of China. According to an Associated Press report from Washington, even though "the search has been abandoned", "a powerful U.S. naval attack force will remain in Southeast Asian waters for some time." The U.S. naval authorities openly stated on the same day that they announced the cessation of the U.S. ship's "search work": "Of the four aircraft carriers west of Hawaii, three are now in the South China Sea area, where they will remain for training exercises and prepare for new contingencies."
	As everyone knows, around the time of the Geneva Conference, in order to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue and the easing of international tensions, and in order to intensify its activities hostile to the Chinese people, the U.S. warmongering clique, in addition to intensifying the activities of its original Seventh Fleet in the Far East, also sent ships from the First Fleet from the United States to the Far Eastern waters. In April of this year, when the U.S. warmongering clique was actively attempting to intervene in the Indochina War, the U.S. naval authorities transferred their naval forces in the Japan-Korea area to the waters near Indochina in the South China Sea, dispatching a fleet including two aircraft carriers to this area for so-called "good weather" "training exercises." At that time, the U.S. warmongers repeatedly clamored for using the U.S. Navy to blockade the southern coast of China under the pretext of intervening in the Indochina War. When the Geneva Conference was about to reach a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue, the U.S. Navy intensified its instigation and support of the Chiang Kai-shek remnants in carrying out piracy on the high seas, openly detaining the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" in an attempt to create maritime conflicts. After the recent accidental incident involving the British aircraft, the U.S. fleet, which had been looking for an opportunity in the South China Sea, immediately launched a long-planned invasion against the Chinese people. In addition to the "Wasp" and "Philippine Sea" aircraft carriers originally in the area, they also dispatched the third aircraft carrier "Tarawa" from the Japan-Korea area to the South China Sea for reinforcement in an attempt to expand the situation. Now that these U.S. ships are still prepared to continue hostile activities against the Chinese people after being forced to leave the waters near Hainan Island, it clearly demonstrates the policy of the U.S. warmongering clique to be hostile to the Chinese people to the end. The Chinese people will watch out with a hundredfold vigilance for any new provocative conspiracies by the U.S. warmongering clique and will resolutely shatter their conspiracies.

    向我挑衅的美舰被迫离开海南岛附近海面
    但它们仍然准备继续对我进行敌对活动
    【新华社三十一日讯】在中国人民的坚决抗议和全世界舆论的愤慨谴责下，向中华人民共和国进行疯狂挑衅的两艘美国航空母舰已经被迫离开海南岛附近海面。但是，坚持与中国人民为敌的美国好战集团，仍然要在南中国海保持美国海军的“攻击力量”，准备继续进行对中华人民共和国的敌对活动。
    华盛顿的美国海军当局二十九日发表了一个声明，宣布美国军舰和飞机“已经停止（对英国失事飞机的）搜寻工作”。美国海军当局在这个声明中，一点都不敢提到美国海军飞机侵入我国领空并击落我机两架的野蛮侵略罪行，反而厚颜无耻地把美国海军在执行“搜寻任务”的幌子下进行侵略活动的卑鄙行为说成是美国海军的“正常的人道行动”。据美国通讯社报道说：在美国海军当局发表声明之后，犯了侵略罪行的那两艘美国航空母舰已经在三十日离开海南岛附近海面，回到美国在菲律宾的马尼拉湾的海军基地。
    美国航空母舰虽然在全世界人民的众目睽睽之下被迫停止目前的挑衅行动，离开海南岛附近的海面，但是美国好战集团仍然没有放弃寻找新的借口、对中华人民共和国继续进行挑衅的阴谋。据美联社从华盛顿报道说：尽管“搜寻工作已经放弃”，但是“强大的美国海军攻击力量仍将留在东南亚海面一个时期”。美国海军当局在宣布美舰停止“搜寻工作”的同一天就公开地说：“在夏威夷以西的四艘航空母舰中，现在有三艘在南中国海地区，它们将留在那里进行训练演习，并准备应付新的意外事件。”
    大家知道，在日内瓦会议举行前后，美国好战集团为了阻挠印度支那问题的和平解决和国际紧张局势的缓和，为了加紧进行敌视中国人民的活动，除了加紧它原在远东的第七舰队的活动之外，又从美国增派了第一舰队的舰只到远东海面来活动。今年四月间，正是美国好战集团积极企图干涉印度支那战争的时候，美国海军当局就把它在日本—朝鲜地区的海军力量转移到南中国海的印度支那附近的海面，调遣了包括两艘航空母舰的舰队到这个地区进行所谓“良好气候”下的“训练演习”。在当时，美国的好战分子们就曾一再叫嚣要以干涉印度支那战争为借口，使用美国海军来封锁中国南方海岸。在日内瓦会议快要达成印度支那问题的和平解决时，美国海军就加紧指使和支持蒋介石残匪在公海上进行海盗活动，公然扣留苏联的“图阿普斯号”油船，企图制造海上的冲突事件。在最近的英国飞机意外事件发生之后，早就在南中国海找寻机会的美国舰队，立即就对中国人民发动了蓄意已久的侵犯。而且除了原在这个地区的“黄蜂号”和“菲律宾海号”两艘航空母舰之外，他们又从日本—朝鲜地区调遣第三艘航空母舰“塔拉瓦号”到南中国海增援，企图扩大事态。现在，这些美国舰只在被迫离开海南岛附近的海面之后，仍然准备继续进行对中国人民的敌对活动，清楚地说明了美国好战集团的企图与中国人民敌对到底的政策。中国人民将百倍警惕地注视着美国好战集团的任何新的挑衅阴谋，并将坚决粉碎他们的阴谋。
