Anshan Iron and Steel's Newly Built Large Rolling Mill, Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and Thin Plate Plant
Produce a Variety of Products to Vigorously Support Production and Construction in Various Regions

Since the commencement of operations at Anshan Iron and Steel's newly built large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and second thin plate plant, they have been actively supporting production and construction throughout the country.

From the end of last year to July of this year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant increased its product specifications from dozens to over five hundred, meeting the needs of construction in various regions.  Employees of the seamless steel tube plant launched labor competitions each time a new product was trial-produced, and the quality of the new products was excellent.

Workers at the large rolling mill put forward the slogan "Roll every heavy rail and channel steel well to support the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project."  Due to their active learning of technology, the output and quality of products have greatly improved.  In the first half of this year alone, they completed order tasks for more than 500 units across the country.

As soon as the automated second thin plate plant began production, it accepted orders from more than 200 units across the country. When they shipped the first batch of thin steel plates to support the First Automobile Factory, the workers happily said, "We must continuously improve quality to ensure that China's first automobile manufacturing plant produces high-quality cars."

    鞍钢新建大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和薄板厂
    生产多种产品大力支援各地生产建设
    鞍钢新建的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和第二薄板厂开工以来，积极支援全国各地生产建设。
    鞍钢无缝钢管厂从去年年底开工到今年七月，产品规格由数十种增加到五百多种，满足了各地建设的需要。无缝钢管厂职工在每次试制新产品时都展开了劳动竞赛，新产品的质量都很好。
    大型轧钢厂的工人们提出了“轧好每一根重轨和槽钢，支援武汉长江大桥工程”的口号。由于他们积极学习技术，产品的产量、质量有了很大的提高。仅今年上半年他们便完成了全国五百多单位的订货任务。
    自动化第二薄板厂刚一开工生产，便接受了全国二百多单位的订货。当他们运出第一批支援第一汽车厂的薄钢板时，工人们高兴地说：“我们一定要不断提高质量，保证我国第一座汽车制造厂制造出优等质量的汽车。”
