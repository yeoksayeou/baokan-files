    Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 19th: TASS, New York, August 19th - The Indonesian representative to the United Nations delivered a letter to the UN Secretary-General on the 18th, requesting him to include the issue of West Irian (Western New Guinea) on the preliminary agenda of the Ninth UN General Assembly.

    Note: During the negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands in The Hague at the beginning of August to discuss the dissolution of the Netherlands-Indonesian Union, the Netherlands categorically refused to discuss the West Irian issue.

    The Indonesian people firmly demand that the Netherlands end its colonial rule in West Irian and incorporate West Irian into Indonesian territory. This demand of the Indonesian people has been greatly strengthened by the United States' plan to establish military bases in West Irian, which will endanger Indonesia's independence and security.

    印度尼西亚驻联合国代表致函联合国秘书长
    要求把西伊里安问题列入九届联大议程
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约十九日讯：印度尼西亚驻联合国代表十八日交给联合国秘书长一封信，要求他把西伊里安（新畿内亚西部）的问题列入联合国第九届大会的初步议程。
    按：在印度尼西亚和荷兰八月初在海牙举行的讨论解散荷兰—印度尼西亚联邦问题的谈判中，荷兰曾断然拒绝讨论西伊里安问题。
    印度尼西亚人民坚决地要求荷兰结束它在西伊里安的殖民统治，并把西伊里安划归印度尼西亚的版图。由于美国计划在西伊里安建立军事基地，而美国的这种行动将危害印度尼西亚的独立和安全，印度尼西亚人民的这个要求大大加强了。
