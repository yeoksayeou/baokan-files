Angang's Third Automated Blast Furnace Undergoing Intense Construction

Skilled workers who have constructed two automated blast furnaces for Anshan Iron and Steel Company are working diligently day and night to transform the appearance of the blast furnace. Currently, welders, riveters, and oxy-acetylene welders are connecting the top ring of the furnace top to the furnace body. The bricklaying efficiency of the two bricklaying teams is very high. In recent days, when laying the furnace bottom, an average of sixteen people have been able to lay more than 3,600 bricks in eight hours, more than doubling the efficiency of building the second automated blast furnace. Behind the blast furnace, workers are welding large pipes connecting the dust collector and the scrubber. At night, illuminated by many electric lights, the workers are even more energetic.

The renovation project of Angang's third automated blast furnace began in April of this year. Now, except for equipment such as windlasses, other auxiliary equipment of the blast furnace has been largely completed. The renovation of the blast furnace itself has also entered an intense stage. The bricklaying work on the furnace bottom was completed on August 3rd with the final process; the bricklaying work on the furnace body is in progress; the cooling boxes and cooling plates between the furnace hearth and the furnace belly have also been installed; the mechanical installation work on the top of the blast furnace is about to begin.

The designed output of Angang's third automated blast furnace is greatly improved compared to before the renovation. The production scale of this blast furnace is comparable to Angang's renovated second automated blast furnace, and it is more advanced in technology than the first and second blast furnaces. The foundation of this blast furnace is poured with a layer of refractory concrete with higher heat resistance, and the furnace hearth is bound by two layers of thick iron plates. In this way, the life of the furnace body can be greatly extended. The latest cooling walls will be installed on the furnace hearth and furnace body. Because of the large cooling area of this cooling wall, serious accidents of molten iron penetrating the furnace wall will not occur in the blast furnace. Spray fans and some powerful ventilators will be installed in all high-temperature operations and places with poor air quality on the blast furnace. In the future, the workers working on the blast furnace will not be exposed to high-temperature heat and will be able to breathe fresh air regularly. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 鞍钢改建的第三座自动化高炉正紧张施工

    鞍钢改建的第三座自动化高炉正紧张施工
    鞍山钢铁公司改建的第三座自动化高炉正在紧张施工。建设过两座自动化高炉的能手们，每天从早到晚以自己辛勤的劳动，改变着高炉的面貌。目前，炉顶上电焊、铆钉和氧焊工人，正把炉顶的顶圈和炉身连接起来。两个砌炉工段工人们的砌砖效率很高。最近几天，他们砌炉底时平均每十六人八小时就可以砌砖三千六百多块，比建设第二座自动化高炉时的效率提高了一倍多。在高炉的后面，工人们正在焊接连接除尘器和洗涤塔的大管子。一到夜间，工人们在好多盏电灯的映照下，工作得更加起劲。
    鞍钢第三座自动化高炉的改建工程是从今年四月开始的。现在，除卷扬机等设备外，高炉的其他附属设备已大部完成。高炉本身的改建工作也进入紧张阶段。炉底的砌砖工作八月三日已进行到最后一个工序；炉身的砌砖工作正在进行中；炉缸到炉腹之间的冷却箱和冷却板也已安装完毕；高炉炉顶的机械安装工作就要开始。
    鞍钢第三座自动化高炉的设计产量，比改建以前有很大提高。这座高炉的生产规模，可以和鞍钢改建的第二座自动化高炉媲美，在技术上要比第一座、第二座更加先进。这座高炉的基础浇灌了一层具有更高抗热力的耐火混凝土，炉缸四周箍了两层厚铁板。这样，炉体的寿命就可以大大延长。在炉缸和炉身上，将要安装最新式的冷却壁。这种冷却壁因冷却面积大，高炉不会发生铁水穿透炉壁的严重事故。高炉上各个高温作业和空气不好的地方，都要安装喷雾式风扇和一些效力大的通风机。将来，在高炉上工作的工人们将受不到高温的熏烤，并且能经常呼吸到新鲜的空气。　　（新华社）
