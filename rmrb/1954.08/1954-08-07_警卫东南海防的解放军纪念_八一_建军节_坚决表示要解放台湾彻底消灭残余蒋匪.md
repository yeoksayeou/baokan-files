Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army coastal defense units, vigilantly guarding the forefront of the motherland's southeast coast, are celebrating "August 1st" Army Day in a combat-ready posture.

Before "August 1st" Army Day, the soldiers guarding a certain island read the "People's Daily" editorials "We Must Liberate Taiwan" and "The Glorious Task of the People's Liberation Army" and discussed the glorious task of liberating Taiwan. Artillery Commander Lou Yimiao said: "We have never forgotten that we must liberate our territory of Taiwan. Our artillery units are always waiting for the motherland to give us the order to liberate Taiwan."

On August 1st, as soon as it dawned, the soldiers began their day of intense activity. Alert sentries stood on various positions on the island; the artillerymen looked out over the vast ocean, monitoring the activities of enemy ships. Anti-aircraft gunners sat attentively on their gun mounts, ready to strike enemy planes that came to sneak attack.

At an air force airfield, as soon as it dawned, brave pilots boarded their iron eagles, ready to strike the Chiang bandit air pirates. Wang Wanlin, Yin Zongmao, and Jiang Kai, who had shot down American-made Chiang bandit fighter planes in air combat, recalled how they went from not being able to fly to being able to skillfully pilot aircraft and even shot down Chiang bandit fighter planes several times. They said that if the Chiang Kai-shek gang's air pirates dared to harass us, we would definitely beat them to a pulp. The pilots and ground crew were very angry when they talked about how American imperialism is stepping up its expansion of the Chiang bandit's remaining air force and plotting to sign a "bilateral common security treaty" with the Chiang bandits in an attempt to occupy our Taiwan for a long time. They said: Taiwan is our territory, we must liberate Taiwan, liberate our Taiwan compatriots who are in dire straits, and completely eliminate the remaining Chiang bandit troops.

On the vast ocean of the motherland, naval patrol vessels are using combat to defend the motherland to commemorate "August 1st" Army Day.

On the eve of "August 1st" Army Day, the East Sea was misty and the wind and waves were very strong. At this time, naval vessels of a certain unit of our navy were patrolling the waters off eastern Zhejiang, ready to strike enemies who might intrude into the coastal areas at any time. At about 10:30 p.m., they received an order from the headquarters: a Chiang Kai-shek warship and a motor gunboat had sneaked into your patrol area, resolutely strike them. Detachment Commander Cai Wenyou immediately ordered: "First-level combat readiness!" "Hard a starboard, forward!" The ships braved the rain and quickly advanced, cutting through the waves. Zhang Fenglai, who was standing on the bow looking out, searched the sea with his eyes glued to his binoculars. An hour passed without finding the enemy, and the sailors became secretly anxious. The commander ordered again: "Increase speed!" Suddenly, dense sparks burst from the exhaust pipes on both sides of the ships, and they continued to sail for another half hour.

"Report to the commander, enemy ships have been spotted firing flares at fifty degrees to the right!"

At this time, Detachment Commander Cai Wenyou used the light of the flares fired by the enemy ships to see three of our large merchant ships sailing from north to south. Then the enemy warship fired flares while covering the motor gunboat as it strafed the merchant ships. The detachment commander immediately ordered: "All ships pay attention, target the enemy motor gunboat!" "Advance at high speed, concentrate firepower, fire!" Our ships rushed forward, and dense artillery fire was directed at the enemy ships. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy ships turned around while firing back. Our ships continued to advance at high speed, getting closer to the enemy ships, and then fired another burst of fierce artillery fire, silencing the enemy ships' guns. They turned their heads and fled south. At this time, our three large merchant ships were undamaged and safely sailed to their destination along the route.

The rain fell even harder, and the wind blew even stronger. The heroic patrol ships continued to sail at sea. At this time, Detachment Commander Cai Wenyou glanced at his watch and said with a smile: "Comrades, the time now is 0:15 a.m., it is already 'August 1st' Army Day!" A burst of laughter immediately erupted on the ships. "This is our gift to celebrate 'August 1st' Army Day!" Someone said under the front main gun. The leader of the main gun squad retorted: "What kind of gift is this? Recovering Taiwan and completely eliminating the Chiang bandits, that would be a good gift!"

    警卫东南海防的解放军纪念“八一”建军节
    坚决表示要解放台湾彻底消灭残余蒋匪
    【新华社六日讯】警惕地警卫在祖国东南海防最前线的人民解放军海防部队的指挥员、战斗员们，以战斗的姿态欢度“八一”建军节。
    守卫在某海岛上的部队在“八一”建军节以前，战士们就阅读了“人民日报”的“一定要解放台湾”和“人民解放军的光荣任务”两篇社论，讨论了解放台湾的光荣任务。炮兵指挥员楼亦淼说：“我们从来没有忘记我们要解放我国领土台湾，我们炮兵部队随时都在等待着祖国给我们解放台湾的命令。”
    八月一日这一天，天刚亮，战士们就开始了一天的紧张生活。在岛上各个阵地上伫立着警惕的哨兵；炮兵们了望着辽阔的海洋，监视着敌舰的活动。高射炮手全神贯注地坐在炮座上，准备打击前来偷袭的敌机。
    在空军某机场上，天刚亮，英勇的飞行员就登上了铁鹰，准备打击蒋匪空中强盗。在空战中曾击落美造蒋匪战斗机的王万林、尹宗茂、姜凯在回忆他们从不会驾驶飞机到能熟练地驾驶飞机，而且还几次击落蒋匪战斗机时说，蒋匪帮空中强盗如果敢来骚扰，我们一定打它个落花流水。飞行员和地勤人员，在谈起美帝国主义正在加紧扩充蒋匪残余空军力量，阴谋和蒋匪签订“共同安全双边条约”，企图长期占领我国台湾等罪恶阴谋时，都非常愤怒。他们说：台湾是我国的领土，我们一定要解放台湾，解放水深火热中的台湾同胞，彻底消灭蒋匪残余军队。
    在辽阔的祖国的海洋上，海军巡逻舰艇用保卫祖国的战斗纪念“八一”建军节。
    “八一”建军节前夕，东海上雾雨濛濛，风浪很大。这时，我海军某部舰艇正在浙东海面上巡逻，准备随时打击窜扰沿海地区的敌人。夜间十点半钟光景，他们收到司令部的命令：蒋匪军舰和马达炮艇各一艘，窜入你们巡逻的海区，坚决予以打击。分队指挥员蔡文友立刻下令：“一级战斗准备！”“右满舵，前进！”舰艇冒着雨，劈开海浪迅速地前进着。站在船头上了望的张风来，两眼靠在望远镜上，搜索着海面。一个钟头过去了，没有发现敌人，水兵们都暗暗地着急起来。指挥员又下令：“加速前进！”顿时，舰艇两侧的排气管迸出密密的火星，又继续航行了半小时。
      “报告指挥员，发现敌舰在右五十度打照明弹！”
    分队指挥员蔡文友这时借着敌舰打出的照明弹的光亮，看见我三艘大商轮由北向南驶来。接着敌人的军舰一边打照明弹，一边掩护着马达炮艇向商轮扫射。分队指挥员立刻下令：“各舰艇注意，目标敌马达炮艇！”“高速前进，集中火力，射击！”我舰艇猛冲过去，密集的炮火向敌舰艇射去。敌舰艇见势不妙，一边调头，一边还击。我舰艇继续以高速前进，离敌舰艇更近了，接着又射出一阵猛烈的炮火，敌舰艇的炮火成了哑吧，它们扭头向南方逃窜了。这时，我三艘大商轮毫无损伤，又安全地按航线向目的地驶去。
    雨下得更大了，风刮得更紧了，英勇的巡逻舰艇继续在海上行驶。这时，分队指挥员蔡文友望了望表，微笑着说：“同志们，现在的时间是零点十五分，已经是‘八一’建军节了！”舰艇上立刻腾起一片欢笑声。“这是咱们庆祝‘八一’建军节的礼物呀！”前主炮下不知谁说了这么一句。主炮班班长反驳说：“这算得上什么礼物？收复台湾，把蒋匪全部消灭，那才是个好礼物哪！”
