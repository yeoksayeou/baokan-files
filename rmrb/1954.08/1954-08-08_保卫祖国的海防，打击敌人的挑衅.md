    Bring Enemy Planes Down into the Sea

    In May, the Maotouyang fishing grounds were experiencing a bountiful harvest. To protect the safety of fishermen's production, our coastal defense troops were conducting intense maritime patrol activities.

    On the morning of May 18th, two naval vessels from a certain coastal defense unit set out for patrol again.

    At 6:30 AM, as the vessels were passing a certain point, the battle alarm suddenly sounded. Everyone rushed to their battle stations like a gust of wind. Political Commissar Zang on the bridge waved a small flag, signaling the fishing boats to disperse quickly. Several pairs of binoculars were fixed intently on the southwest. Through the misty morning sea, four Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes were spotted flying towards us, skimming the water's surface. The captain loudly issued the order: "Hard to port, form an anti-aircraft formation!" At this time, the gunners had already loaded shells into the breeches.

    The enemy planes approached. The main guns, with their longer range, fired first. However, the first pair of enemy planes passed through the smoke of the exploding shells and continued to charge, beginning to strafe. Then, following the firing of the main guns, came a burst of anti-aircraft artillery fire. The lead enemy plane was hit, trailing black smoke, and crashed into the sea.

    The remaining enemy planes continued to attack our vessels. The aiming gunners tensely rotated the handwheels, targeting the enemy in their sights, firing continuously. A string of tracer bullets could be seen hitting behind the planes. Artillery Chief Li Baihuai shouted loudly, "Add ten!" The gunners corrected the deviation, firing several bursts. The second burst hit the enemy plane's neck, right behind the propeller. A flash of fire was followed by a "boom!" The enemy plane exploded, its wreckage spewing thick smoke in the air, arcing down and plunging into the sea. A wisp of black smoke lingered on the water's surface for a long time.

    Immediately, Political Commissar Zang's voice came from the bridge: "Comrades, we've shot down two enemy planes! Well done! Well done!"

    The comrades at every battle station on the ship cheered in unison: "Well done! Let's shoot them down again!"

    The atmosphere on deck became even more intense. The gunners stared intently through their sights, the gun barrels rotating in circles with the enemy planes. During the enemy planes' second attack, another one was shot down by our vessel's main guns. The last enemy plane still attempted to approach our vessel, but was blocked by a wall of anti-aircraft fire formed by our guns, from 2,000 meters away. The enemy plane had no choice but to flee south in panic. A wave of victorious cheers erupted on the ship. The time was 6:55 AM. (Tian Erdong)

    Account of Annihilating the Enemy in the Air and Sea

    On May 19th, a light rain fell, and the sky and sea were covered in mist. On this day, Chiang Kai-shek's aerial bandits, piloting four American-made F-47 fighter planes, attempted to stealthily raid our coastal peaceful residents under the cover of the clouds and fog.

    Shortly after 1:00 PM, our coastal air force detected enemy aircraft activity. The commander immediately issued the order to take off for combat. Following the red signal flares rising above the airfield, Flight Leader Wang Wanlin and Wingman Song Guoqing took off. Then, another Flight Leader, Zong Defeng, and Wingman Yin Zongmao also steered their eagles into the sky.

    They pierced through the thick clouds, flying towards the designated air combat area. Before long, Wingman Song Guoqing spotted the enemy planes. Flight Leader Wang Wanlin, hearing Song Guoqing's report of spotting the enemy, immediately ordered: "I'll cover your attack." Receiving the order, Song Guoqing immediately dropped his auxiliary fuel tank, circling behind the enemy plane, pushed the control stick, and dove down. Seeing the reticle lock onto the enemy plane, he thought: "Alright, kid, where do you think you're going? I'm going to blast you to smithereens in the air!" He pressed the firing button with his finger, and a string of shells, trailing red light, flew towards the enemy plane's cockpit. The enemy plane immediately exploded in mid-air.

    The remaining three enemy planes, seeing the situation was bad, hurriedly dropped their bombs into the sea, preparing to flee for their lives.

    At this time, Flight Leader Wang Wanlin made a left turn, charging towards an enemy plane. However, this cunning enemy evaded him, using irregular flight maneuvers. Just as Flight Leader Wang Wanlin locked the reticle onto it, it turned around and dove under Wang Wanlin's fuselage. Wang Wanlin judged from the enemy plane's cunning maneuvers that this guy must be an old flying fox. So he pulled the control stick, ascending to a higher altitude, looking down and monitoring this cunning fellow. When it flew straight to escape, he suddenly pounced down and fired at it. The enemy plane trailed black smoke, falling into the sea like a kite with a broken string.

    At this time, our other pair of eagles also rushed to the air combat area. Wingman Yin Zongmao unexpectedly and quickly caught up with an enemy plane attempting to escape. The enemy plane reduced its altitude, attempting to escape by skimming the sea surface, but the brave Yin Zongmao immediately descended from high altitude to low altitude, attacking the enemy plane. At this time, Flight Leader Wang Wanlin's voice came to his ears: "Pay attention to safe altitude!" Heeding the flight leader's reminder, he skillfully used the moving reticle to lock onto the enemy plane. He aimed accurately, and with just one attack, blew the enemy plane to pieces.

    At this time, Wingman Song Guoqing riddled the last enemy plane with holes, so much that it wobbled and staggered, desperately fleeing.

    When our four eagles returned victoriously, they saw farmers and fishermen on the ground and at sea waving their hats to welcome them. (Wen Xiong, Jiang Ming, Ba Li)

    Three Shots, Two Hits, Destroying the Enemy's Position

    On the afternoon of May 27th, the sun was already setting, and the artillerymen were preparing supper. Suddenly, "Boom!" A shell fired from Little Kinmen.

    "The enemy is firing potshots again!" someone shouted.

    The artillerymen dropped their bowls and rushed to their positions. "Boom!" Another shell exploded in the sea in front of our position. Aiming Gunner Zhou Hongfa said angrily, "You little bastards, your bones are itching again. I'll give you a big one to taste!" Artillery Chief Liu Yuming saw that the comrades were all in high spirits and encouraged everyone: "Comrades, today is the time to practically check our training results. Everyone must remain calm and accurately strike the enemy." The comrades replied, "We will answer the people of the whole country with our battle results!" At this time, the telephone rang, conveying the order to "Destroy the enemy's Shanglin artillery position with one shot." Immediately afterward, the artillery chief issued the firing order. First Gunner and Second Gunner skillfully pointed the gun at the enemy's artillery position. "Boom!" The shell tore through the sky and sea, flying towards Little Kinmen Island, exploding near the enemy position. At this time, the enemy fired another shell, landing in front of our position. The command post conveyed the order: "Direction good, reduce two-one, fire!" The second shell, "whoosh," flew past. Aiming Gunner Zhou Hongfa saw through the sight that the shell exploded precisely on the enemy's artillery position, without deviation. He was feeling happy when the command post called again: "Well done! Fire another one at the same distance!" In an instant, the third shell flew towards the enemy position, and the enemy's artillery position became silent. When the artillerymen wanted to fire a couple more shots, the command post ordered them to stop. The deputy company commander said, "Artillery Chief, comrades, you fired very well, three shots, two hits, completing the task of destroying the enemy's artillery."

    The artillerymen were overjoyed, jumping down from their positions, hugging each other and jumping up and down in wild celebration. (Ding Lin)

    保卫祖国的海防，打击敌人的挑衅
    把敌机打到海里去
    五月，正是猫头洋渔场的丰收季节，为了保护渔民安全生产，我海防部队进行着紧张的海上巡逻活动。
    五月十八日清晨，海防某部的两艘舰艇又出发巡逻了。
    六点半钟，舰艇刚刚过了某处，突然战斗警报响了，大家像阵风似地立即站好战斗岗位。驾驶台上的臧政委挥动着小旗，要渔船赶快疏散。几副望远镜紧紧地盯着西南方。透过海上蒙蒙的晨雾，发现有四架蒋匪飞机正贴着水面向我们飞来，舰长响亮地下达口令：“左舵，成防空队形！”这时，炮手们已把炮弹压在弹槽里了。
    敌机近了，主炮射程远，先开了炮，可是第一对敌机穿过炮弹爆炸的烟雾，继续冲来，并开始扫射，这时，紧跟着主炮的发射，是一阵高射炮排炮的声音，前面一架敌机已被打中，拖着一股黑烟，栽到海里去了。
    其余的敌机还在向我舰艇攻击，瞄准手们紧张地旋转着摇把，在瞄准镜中对准敌人，连续开炮，眼看一串曳光弹打到飞机后边去了。炮长李百淮用力喊道：“加十！”炮手们纠正了偏差，打了几个点射，第二发点射正中一架敌机螺旋桨后的颈部，只见火光一闪，接着“轰！”的一声，敌机爆炸了，敌机残骸在空中喷射着浓烟，划了一道弧线，一头钻下海去。水面上还久久浮悬着一绺黑烟。
    这时，马上从驾驶台上传来了臧政委的喊声：“同志们，两架敌机被我们揍下海了。打得好！打得好！”
    舰上各个战斗岗位上的同志们也一齐欢呼起来：“打得好！再打！”
    舱面上更加紧张起来，炮手们一个个目不转睛地对着瞄准镜，炮口随着敌机转着圆圈。敌机第二次攻击时，又被我舰上的主炮打落了一架。最后一架敌机还企图接近我舰，但在二千公尺开外，就被我们的高射炮火组成的一道火墙挡住了。敌机只得仓惶向南逃走了。舰上腾起一阵胜利的欢呼。这时时间是六点五十五分。　　　　　　（田尔东）海空歼敌记
    五月十九日，细雨蒙蒙，海空上面云雾弥漫。这天，蒋匪空中强盗驾着四架美制F—47战斗机，借着云雾的掩护，想来偷袭我沿海的和平居民。
    下午一点多钟，我沿海空军某部发觉有敌机活动后，指挥员当即下达了起飞战斗的命令，紧跟着机场上空升起的红色信号弹，长机王万林和僚机宋国卿起飞了。接着，另一个长机宗德峰和僚机尹宗茂也驾着雄鹰飞向了天空。
    他们穿过厚厚的云层，朝着指定的空战区域飞去。不一会，僚机宋国卿发现了敌机，长机王万林听到宋国卿报告发现敌机，立刻命令道：“我掩护你攻击。”宋国卿得到命令后，立即丢掉副油箱，绕到敌机尾后，一推操纵杆，俯冲下去。看看光环套住了敌机，心里想：“好小子，看你向哪儿跑，这会非打你个空中开花不可！”用手指一按电门，一串炮弹曳着红光朝敌机座舱飞去，敌机当即在空中爆炸了。
    其余三架敌机见势不好，慌慌张张把炸弹扔向大海，准备各自逃命。
    这时，长机王万林来了一个左转弯，朝一架敌机冲过去。可是这个狡猾的敌人，运用不规则的航法躲闪着。长机王万林刚用光环套住它，它却扭过头来钻到王万林的机腹下面去了。王万林从敌机这些狡猾的动作判断这家伙定是个老飞贼。于是便一拉操纵杆，升上高空，低下头来监视着这个狡猾的家伙，等到它直线逃跑时，便猛地扑下来对准开炮，敌机拖着黑烟，像断了线的风筝一样掉到大海里去了。
    这时，我们的另一对雄鹰，也紧跟着赶到了空战区域。僚机尹宗茂出敌不意，迅速地追上一架企图逃走的敌机。敌机降低高度，企图贴着海面逃走，可是勇敢的尹宗茂，马上从高空降到低空，向敌机攻击。这时他耳边传来了长机王万林的声音：“注意安全高度！”他注意了长机的提醒，熟练地使用活动光环套住了敌机。他瞄得准准的，只一次攻击，就把敌机打得粉碎。
    这时僚机宋国卿把最后一架敌机打穿了好几个洞，直打得它一歪一斜，拼命逃走了。
    当我们的四架雄鹰胜利地返回时，他们看到地面上和海洋上的农民和渔民们，正在挥舞着帽子欢迎他们。                  （文雄

      三发两中摧毁敌阵
    五月二十七日下午，太阳已经偏西了，炮手们正开晚饭。突然“轰”的一声，从小金门打来了一发炮弹。
    “敌人又在打冷炮！”谁叫了一声。
    炮手们把饭碗一放，飞快地奔向阵地。“轰！”又一发炮弹在我阵地前沿海中爆炸了。瞄准手周洪发气愤地说：“兔崽子，骨头又痒痒了，老子给你个大家伙尝尝！”炮长刘玉明看到同志们个个情绪高昂，便鼓励大家道：“同志们今天是实地检查咱们练兵成绩的时候，大家要沉住气，准确地打击敌人。”同志们回答说：“以战绩来回答全国人民！”这时电话铃响了，传来“一炮摧毁敌人上林炮阵地”的命令，紧接着炮长下了射击命令，一炮手和二炮手熟练地把炮口指向敌人的炮阵地。“轰隆”一声，炮弹划破海空，飞向小金门岛，在敌阵地附近爆炸开来。这时敌人又打来一发炮弹，落在我阵地前沿。指挥所传来命令：“方向好，减二一发射！”第二发炮弹，“嗖”地飞了过去；瞄准手周洪发从瞄准镜里看到，炮弹不偏不移在敌人的炮阵地上爆炸了。他心里正在高兴，指挥所又传来电话：“打得好！原距离再来一发！”转瞬间第三发炮弹又飞向敌阵，敌人的炮阵地变成哑巴了。当炮手们还想揍两炮时，指挥所命令停放，副连长说：“一炮长同志，你们打得很好，三发两中，完成了摧毁敌炮的任务。”
    炮手们欣喜非常，跳下炮位，互相抱着狂欢地跳起来。
