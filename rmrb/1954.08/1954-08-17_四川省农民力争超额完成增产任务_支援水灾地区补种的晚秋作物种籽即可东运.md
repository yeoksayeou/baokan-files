Sichuan Province Farmers Strive to Overfulfill Production Increase Targets
	Late Autumn Crop Seeds for Supporting Flood-Affected Areas' Replanting Ready to Ship East

	Sichuan Province, the largest grain-producing province in the country, is striving to complete and overfulfill this year's target of increasing grain production by 2.1 billion catties in order to support the disaster areas in parts of the Yangtze River and Huai River basins.

	Currently, rice in most parts of Sichuan Province is nearing maturity and is expected to have a bumper harvest; rice in a few areas is experiencing poor grain setting due to excessive rainfall. In order to ensure the completion of this year's agricultural production increase task and to support the disaster areas in parts of the Yangtze River and Huai River basins, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to its subordinate organizations at the end of July: in areas where crops have not yet matured, all efforts should be made to prevent floods and waterlogging, and to prevent lodging and mildew; in areas where crops have matured and harvesting has begun, all possible measures should be taken to prevent field scattering and waste, striving to avoid losing a single grain of rice in order to increase the harvest. After the harvest of the spring crops and before the planting of the winter crops, another season of crops should be planted according to local conditions.

	According to this instruction, the Communist Party organizations at all levels in Sichuan Province have made urgent arrangements. The Suining Local Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to send more than 300 cadres to the countryside to help rural cadres mobilize farmers, especially relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, to strive to complete the task of increasing production. In order to reduce field scattering and increase rice yield by 15 catties per mu, the Suining Special District has trained a large number of carpenters to manufacture threshing machines, striving to have one in every village; at the same time, each village will generally hold meetings of threshing experts to improve threshing techniques. Each special district and county has also formulated plans to increase the planting of a season of crops after the autumn harvest, striving to "use one mu of land as two mu of land." According to preliminary statistics from six special districts including Wanxian, Jiangjin, and Suining: the planned area for increasing the planting of a season of grain and green manure crops totals 2.37 million mu. The Fuling Local Committee of the Communist Party of China estimates that as a result of increasing the planting of short-term crops and reducing field scattering, the entire Fuling Special District can increase grain production by approximately 100 million catties. Currently, rural supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are transferring and purchasing seeds of various short-term crops to supply farmers in a timely manner. The "Agricultural Communication" compiled and printed by the Sichuan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry and Department of Water Conservancy has also recently focused on introducing the experience of planting various short-term crops.

	Xinhua News Agency: Sichuan farmers are selling large quantities of late autumn crop seeds such as potatoes, broad beans, and carrots to the state to support farmers in flood-affected areas of Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces to replant late autumn crops. As of August 8, farmers across the province had sold more than 19.6 million catties of potato seeds to the state, of which more than 12.6 million catties have been transferred and concentrated, and are ready to be shipped to Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces.

### 四川省农民力争超额完成增产任务  支援水灾地区补种的晚秋作物种籽即可东运

    四川省农民力争超额完成增产任务
    支援水灾地区补种的晚秋作物种籽即可东运
    全国产粮最多的四川省，力争完成和超额完成今年增产二十一亿斤粮食的任务，以支援长江中下游和淮河流域部分灾区。
    目前四川省大部地区水稻已近成熟，可望丰收；少数地区因雨水过多，水稻结实较差。为了切实保证完成今年农业增产的任务，支援长江中下游和淮河流域部分灾区，中共四川省委员会已在七月底指示所属各级组织：在若干未成熟地区，应尽一切努力防洪防涝、防止倒伏霉烂；在已经成熟并开始收割的地区，应想尽一切办法防止田间抛撒浪费，争取做到不抛失颗粒粮食，以提高收获量。各地在大春作物收获后、小春作物播种前，应因地制宜增种一季作物。
    根据这个指示，中共四川省各级组织都作了紧急布置。中共遂宁地方委员会决定派三百多名干部下乡，帮助农村干部发动农民，特别是依靠互助合作组织，努力完成增产任务。为了减少田间抛撒，使每亩水稻多收十五斤稻谷，遂宁专区已训练大批木工制造打谷机，争取每个村都有一架；同时各乡村将普遍召开打谷能手会议，以改进打谷技术。各专区、各县还订出秋后增种一季作物的计划，争取“一亩田当两亩田用”。据万县、江津、遂宁等六个专区的初步统计：计划增种一季粮食和绿肥作物的面积共有二百三十七万亩。中共涪陵地方委员会计算增种短期作物和减少田间抛撒的结果，整个涪陵专区可增产粮食约一亿斤。现在各地农村供销合作社正调运和收购各种短期作物的种籽，以及时供应农民。四川省人民政府农林厅、水利厅编印的“农业通讯”，最近也着重介绍了种植各种短期作物的经验。　（新华社）

    四川省农民把大批马铃薯、蚕豆、胡萝卜等晚秋作物种籽卖给国家，支援湖南、安徽等省水灾地区的农民兄弟补种晚秋作物。到八月八日止，全省农民卖给国家的马铃薯种已达一千九百六十多万斤，其中有一千二百六十多万斤已经调运集中，就可运往湖南、安徽等省。
