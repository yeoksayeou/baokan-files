    Hubei Province, famous for its freshwater fish fry, has achieved a bumper harvest. The Yangtze River, which stretches 700 kilometers within Hubei Province, is rich in freshwater fish fry such as silver carp and bighead carp. After late April, fishermen in the province's forty fish fry production areas engaged in intense harvesting work. Thanks to the active production of the fishermen, despite the large Yangtze River water levels, a bumper harvest of fish fry was still achieved. According to recent statistics, the province produced a total of 2 billion fish fry during the entire production season, exceeding the planned target. This fully supplies the fish fry needed for the development of the fish industry throughout the country. (Li Xianlu)

    湖北省淡水鱼苗获得丰收
    著名的湖北省淡水鱼苗获得丰收。湖北省境内有七百公里长的长江江水，盛产鲢、鳙等淡水鱼苗。四月下旬以后，全省四十个鱼苗产地的渔工渔民投入了紧张捞捕工作。由于渔工渔民的积极生产，虽在长江水势很大的情况下，鱼苗仍获得丰收，据最近的统计，在整个产季中全省共产鱼苗二十亿尾，超额完成计划。充分供应了全国各地发展鱼业所需要的鱼苗。　（李先碌）
