Hebei Province's summer grain tax collection and planned wheat purchase work have been rapidly launched, with farmers actively paying summer grain tax and selling wheat to the state.

This year, Hebei Province farmers have been paying summer grain tax and selling surplus grain at a rapid pace. According to incomplete statistics from the province's tax-collecting areas as of July 21, the amount of wheat stored has reached 49.1% of the province's planned collection and purchase volume. Among them, Handan and Xingtai Special Districts have completed about 75% of their respective district plans; Shijiazhuang, Cangxian, and Tangshan Special Districts have completed about 50% of their plans. Handan City ended the collection and purchase work as early as July 8, and Pingxiang, Baixiang, Lincheng, Qinghe, Qiu County, Wu'an, Cheng'an, She County, and other places have also completed their tasks successively. The promulgation and promotion of the draft constitution have further encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for paying and selling grain. After being educated about the draft constitution, farmers in Zhaicheng Village, the eighth district of Ding County, paid and sold more than 86,000 jin of wheat in less than half a day on July 9, exceeding the original purchase plan by more than 2,200 jin.

The quality of wheat paid and sold to the state by Hebei Province farmers this year is generally good. Farmers in Handan Special District proposed the slogan "Wheat should be dried and cleaned in the village, and inferior grain should not leave the village." The grain tax task of Luyingpu Village in Handan County is more than 12,500 jin, and 90% has already been dried; many farmers, fearing that the ground is damp and wheat is not easy to dry, moved it to the roof to dry. Gao Rongfu, a farmer in Beigaozhuang Village, Huolu County, fearing that his wheat was not as good as others, winnowed more than 360 jin of wheat twice.

State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Shandong Province, in coordination with the planned wheat purchase work, transferred large quantities of materials to rural areas to supply the broad masses of farmers.

The total value of production materials that the Shandong Provincial Cooperative Federation plans to supply in the third quarter is 140.38% higher than the actual sales performance in the same period last year. The quantity of summer medicines planned to be supplied by the Shandong Provincial Company of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation in the third quarter, such as Rendan, Cooling Oil, Ten Drops Water, and DDT, has increased nearly five times compared with the actual sales performance in the second quarter. In order to understand the needs of farmers, the state-owned Laiyang Department Store invited salespersons and shop assistants from thirteen grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives for discussions twice in May to solicit opinions on supply work, based on which the third-quarter plan was revised. The Changwei Branch of the Shandong Provincial Cooperative Federation sent people to other provinces to organize sources of goods in March. By the end of June, it had purchased nearly 20 million jin of various oil cakes from Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, and other places. On July 4, the Finance and Economics Committee of the Tai'an District Commissioner's Office also held a joint meeting of supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned commercial departments to exchange more than 120 kinds of materials with a total transaction value of 10.4 billion yuan.

With the development of wheat purchase work, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Shandong have used methods such as retail sales in stores, setting up stalls in fairs, delivering goods to the countryside, and holding small-scale material exchange meetings to supply large quantities of materials to the masses of farmers in a timely manner. The grassroots cooperatives in Fan County delivered goods to the countryside 98 times in 20 days, with a total supply value of more than 170 million yuan. The Kaiyuansi Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the sixth district of Ningyang County held four small-scale material exchange meetings in townships far from the town, with a total supply and sales value of more than 120 million yuan. During this period, the cooperative recovered currency, accounting for more than 76% of the currency put into circulation. In late June, some areas suffered from insect pests, and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places supplied pesticides and implements in a timely manner. After an insect pest occurred in Wucheng County, the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives immediately organized 13,500 jin of wettable "666" powder and supplied it to farmers. Due to the development of supply work, the turnover of many units has increased significantly. The actual sales performance of the Shandong Provincial Company of China Department Store in mid-June increased by 23% compared with the first ten days of the month; among them, matches increased by 23%, towels increased by 29%, and undershirts and vests increased by 50%.

    河北省夏征和统购的小麦近半数入库
    山东省配合统购小麦供应农村大批物资
    河北省今年的夏征工作和小麦计划收购工作已经迅速开展，广大农民积极缴纳夏征公粮和把小麦卖给国家。
    今年河北省农民缴纳夏征公粮和出售余粮的速度很快。据全省已开征地区截至七月二十一日的不完全统计，小麦入库量已相当于全省计划征收和收购量的百分之四十九点一。其中邯郸专区和邢台专区已完成本专区计划的百分之七十五左右；石家庄、沧县、唐山等专区已完成计划百分之五十左右；邯郸市七月八日就已结束征收和收购工作，平乡、柏乡、临城、清河、邱县、武安、成安、涉县等地，也已先后完成任务。宪法草案的公布和宣传，更加鼓舞了农民的缴粮和卖粮热情。定县第八区翟城村农民受到关于宪法草案的宣传以后，在七月九日不到半天的时间，就缴纳和出售了八万六千多斤小麦，比原来的收购计划多出售二千二百多斤。
    河北省农民今年缴给和卖给国家的小麦，质量
  一般都比较好。邯郸专区各地农民提出了“小麦在村晒干扬净，次粮不出村”的口号。邯郸县陆营堡村缴粮任务是一万二千五百多斤，已经晒干了百分之九十；许多农民怕地皮潮湿小麦不易晒干，便搬到房顶上去晒。获鹿县北高庄村农民高荣福唯恐自己的小麦不如别人的好，把三百六十多斤小麦扇簸了两遍。
    山东省国营商业部门和供销合作社配合小麦计划收购工作，把大批物资调往农村，供应给广大农民。
    山东省合作总社第三季度计划供应生产资料的总值，比去年同期销货实绩增加百分之一百四十点三八。中国医药公司山东省公司第三季度计划供应的夏令成药，如仁丹、清凉油、十滴水、滴滴涕等的数量，比第二季度销货实绩增加将近五倍。为了了解农民的需要，国营莱阳百货商店在五月份曾两次邀请十三处基层供销合作社的营业员和销货员进行座谈，征求了关于供应工作的意见，据以修改了第三季度的计划。山东省合作总社昌潍专区分社在三月份就派人到外省组织货源，到六月底止，已经从江西、湖北、河南等地购进各种饼肥近两千万斤。七月四日，泰安区专员公署财政经济委员会还召开了供销合作社、国营商业部门的联席会议，互相交流物资一百二十余种，成交总额达一百零四亿元。
    随着小麦收购工作的开展，山东各地国营商业部门和供销合作社通过门市零售、集市摆摊、下乡送货、举行小型物资交流会等方法，把大批物资及时地供应到农民群众手中。范县各基层合作社在二十天中，下乡送货九十八次，供应总额达一亿七千多万元。宁阳县第六区开元寺供销合作社在离市镇较远的乡举行过四次小型物资交流会，供销总额达一亿二千多万元。在这个期间，该社回笼货币，占投放货币的百分之七十六以上。六月下旬部分地区发生虫害，各地供销合作社及时供应了农药械。武城县发生虫害后，各基层供销合作社立即组织了一万三千五百斤可湿性“六六六”粉，供应给农民。由于供应工作的开展，许多单位的营业额有了显著增加。中国百货公司山东省公司六月中旬销售实绩，比上旬增加百分之二十三；其中火柴增加百分之二十三，毛巾增加百分之二十九，汗衫、背心增加百分之五十。　（邢冠五等）
