Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th, TASS dispatch: Statement by the Soviet Government regarding the convening of a meeting of the four foreign ministers.

The Soviet Ambassador to France, S.A. Vinogradov, visited French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mendès France on August 4th, and, on behalf of the Soviet Government, presented the following statement:

"The Geneva Conference demonstrated that consultations between the countries concerned on unresolved international issues can produce constructive results that meet the needs of easing international tensions and strengthening peace.

In this regard, it is known that the Soviet Government has suggested to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States that a conference be held in the coming months, attended by all European countries willing to attend, as well as the United States, with an observer from the People's Republic of China present, to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. There is no doubt that such a conference would be of great significance in easing international tensions and further developing international cooperation.

At the same time, in view of the importance of the aforementioned conference, the Soviet Government believes that it would be useful for the governments of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to jointly discuss the issue of convening this conference and the measures to promote its success. To this end, the Soviet Government suggests that the foreign ministers of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union hold a meeting in August or September of this year, at which the German question could also be further studied.

In doing so, the Soviet Government also takes into account the fact that no agreement has yet been reached on the main aspects of the German question, namely the restoration of German unity and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, because so far all the necessary conditions for this have obviously not been established. In this situation, the Soviet Government believes that new efforts should be made to reach agreement, first of all, on certain aspects of the German question, for which solutions acceptable to the parties concerned can now be found."

The Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ya.A. Malik, and the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, G.N. Zarubin, presented similar statements to the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lloyd, and the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, respectively, on August 4th.

    苏联政府向法、英、美三国政府提出声明
    建议召开四国外长会议
    研究有关建立欧洲集体安全体系问题和德国问题
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：苏联政府关于召开四国外长会议的声明。
    苏联驻法国大使斯·阿·维诺格拉多夫在八月四日访问了法国总理兼外交部长孟戴斯—弗朗斯，并奉苏联政府之命提出下列声明：
    “日内瓦会议说明，有关国家就悬而未决的国际问题进行协商，是能够产生符合于缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平的需要的建设性结果的。
    在这方面，大家知道，苏联政府已向法国、英国和美国政府建议在今后几个月内召开一个有一切愿意出席的欧洲国家以及美国参加、并有一位中华人民共和国代表的观察员列席的会议，来讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。毫无疑问，这样一个会议对缓和国际紧张局势和进一步发展国际合作是具有极重要意义的。
    同时，鉴于上述会议的重要性，苏联政府认为由法国、英国、美国和苏联政府先行共同讨论召开这个会议的问题和促使会议获得成功的措施是有用处的。为此，苏联政府建议法国、英国、美国和苏联的外长们在今年八、九月间举行一个会议，这个会上还可以继续研究德国问题。
    苏联政府在这样做的时候也考虑到这一事实：关于德国问题的主要方面，即恢复德国的统一和与德国缔结和约问题，到目前还未能达成协议，因为到目前为止关于这一点的一切必要条件显然还没有建立起来。在这种情况下，苏联政府认为应当进行新的努力，以便首先就德国问题的某些方面达成协议，关于这些方面，现在已能找到能为有关方面接受的解决办法。”
    苏联驻英国大使雅·亚·马立克和苏联驻美国大使格·纳·查鲁宾八月四日分别向英国外交副大臣劳埃德先生和美国国务卿杜勒斯先生提出类似的声明。
