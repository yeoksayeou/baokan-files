Why Some Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Ping Shan County Have Collapsed and Disintegrated
    Zhen Sheng, Gao Kui

    Ping Shan County, Hebei Province, is an old liberated area with a strong Party foundation. In theory, the mutual aid and cooperation movement should have achieved great success, but in reality, this is not the case. Last year, the number of organized farming households accounted for 23.1% of the total number of farming households in the county. After the publicity of the general task for the transition period, this number only increased by 3% this year. Out of the 69 agricultural production cooperatives in the county, 5 have collapsed, 14 have members withdrawing, and many cooperatives cannot be consolidated and improved.

    The reason for these situations is inseparable from the Ping Shan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's neglect of leadership.

    During the establishment of cooperatives this spring, the Ping Shan County Committee had disagreements in its leadership thinking: Former Deputy Secretary of the County Committee, Li Jianxiu, believed that the Party organization in rural areas should be relied upon, combined with the publicity of the general line and general task, to vigorously lead the work of establishing cooperatives. Zheng Ruiping (County Head), a member of the County Committee, was afraid of affecting his control of grain procurement and the general election work, and believed that it would be impossible to lead if too many cooperatives were established. The majority of the County Committee members agreed with Zheng Ruiping's mistaken opinion, and under the control of this thinking, the work of developing cooperatives was handed over to a small number of cadres. In mid-January, 23 general county and district cadres were selected to go to the villages to directly find targets for establishing cooperatives. Because the County Committee did not grasp the leadership tightly, these cadres abandoned the grassroots Party organizations in the townships and villages when establishing cooperatives, and did not start from raising the socialist consciousness of the peasants. As a result, the number of cooperatives established was small and the quality was low. For example, when the Li Minshu Cooperative in Nan Gunlong Gou was established, the district cadres only found a mutual aid team to mobilize, and did not give play to the role of the Party organization. Wang Zhitai, the village Party branch secretary, retained 45% of his private plot after joining the cooperative, and did not play a leading role. This cooperative collapsed shortly after it was established. Zhang Shuying, Deputy Secretary of the Third District Committee, established the Han Yinlai Cooperative in Tianying Village by allowing large amounts of loans. After the cooperative was established, it collapsed because it could not get loans and because it had not been led for a long time. The village branch did not even know that the cooperative had collapsed for more than a month. Due to the poor ideological foundation at the time of establishing the cooperatives and the lack of specific leadership after the establishment, five of the 69 cooperatives established in the county collapsed by April.

    The County Committee did not examine from the perspective of leadership thinking how these situations arose, and simply adopted a method of assigning responsibility to individual cadres: 64 cooperatives in the county were assigned to county and district cadres. Because the County Committee did not pay attention to the leadership in its thinking, and did not carry out in-depth ideological mobilization and specific guidance for the cadres, the situation of relaxing leadership did not change after the responsibility was assigned. Four of the five County Committee members did not visit the cooperatives they were responsible for in two months. County Head Zheng Ruiping said: "I only manage the work of the office. The work is too busy. The cooperatives assigned to the government have already been managed by capable cadres!" But the actual situation was that Zheng Ruiping was responsible for the Mengling Village Cooperative and sent Ren Fenglan, a staff member of the Civil Affairs Section, to lead it. Ren Fenglan was a layman when it came to running cooperatives. She cried when she heard that she was going to lead a cooperative. The head of the Civil Affairs Section mobilized her for three days, but she still couldn't get her thinking straight. She couldn't play a leading role in the cooperative either. The cooperative only engaged in sideline occupations, and agricultural production was very poor. Now, the cooperative director, Cui Jinting, has withdrawn from the cooperative, and the cooperative is about to collapse. Zheng Ruiping has not found a way to solve the problem. The cooperatives assigned to the leading cadres of the county are like this, and the cooperatives assigned to the various departments will not be better. The County Women's Federation was responsible for the Du Laiwa Cooperative in He Village, but no one paid attention to it for a long time. There was a serious phenomenon of wasted work in the cooperative. The deputy director said: "If the higher authorities don't help us solve the problem, how can we take the socialist road!"

    The County Committee turned the assignment of responsibility into neglecting management. Moreover, the assignment did not take into account the conditions, and mistakenly called on economic departments such as banks and supply and marketing cooperatives to be responsible for cooperatives as well. These departments also had to select cadres to leave their jobs and live in the cooperatives to lead. The County Committee did not have unified leadership, and the departments did not check and supervise, so many cadres living in the cooperatives were undisciplined, lazy, and did not work actively. The Ping Shan County Branch of the People's Bank of China was responsible for the Ren Shoutian Cooperative in Zhengjia Village, which only had four households. There was nothing wrong with it, and the cadres living in the cooperative had nothing to do, so they read Peking opera books every day, and slept when they were tired. The County Committee of the Communist Youth League was responsible for the Li Chouwa Cooperative in Wangmu Village. The cooperative was about to collapse due to wasted work. Liu Guozhi, the secretary of the County Committee of the Communist Youth League, consulted with Zhao Shifang, the secretary of the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhao Shifang said: "We have a clear division of labor. If it collapses, you are responsible." He did not help solve the problem, but only criticized them. Because the County Committee did not pay attention to running cooperatives ideologically, the district committees did not strengthen leadership either. The districts also followed the County Committee's practice and contracted out the cooperatives. Zuo Xianglai, Secretary of the Third District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said: "This assignment of cooperatives has reduced our leadership responsibility." The work of mutual aid and cooperation in the entire district was handed over to Zhou Siyi, the propaganda officer of the District Committee, to take charge of. Of the six districts in the county, four districts had organization committee members or propaganda committee members in charge of mutual aid and cooperation. The First District Committee was responsible for the Hu Qingyun Cooperative in Yiyang Village. Hu Qingyun and others divided up the 5 million yuan livestock loan. A cooperative member, Jia Lianqiu, withdrew from the cooperative and destroyed the two acres and seven fen of cotton in the cooperative and replanted it with corn. Li Mingfang, the cadre living in the cooperative, did not know about it even after living in the village for two months. Because the County Committee did not conscientiously implement the policy of "the secretary being responsible and the whole Party running the cooperatives," the backbone role of the grassroots Party organizations in the mutual aid and cooperation movement was greatly weakened. Some township and village Party branches saw that the agricultural production cooperatives were all contracted out by county and district cadres, and they thought that leading the cooperatives had nothing to do with them. Liu Hanjie, Secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Party of Mengxianbi Township, said: "The agricultural production cooperative is contracted out by the district, and we don't understand anything about it. This is a relief." Of the 60 Party members in Guxian Township, only 9 participated in mutual aid teams; of the 11 branch committee members, only 2 participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Some Party members not only did not actively lead the peasants to take the socialist road, but also developed capitalism. Yan Fengli, the Party branch secretary of Yan Changyu Village, and three Party members, also hired long-term workers. Gai Zongtang and other cadres, the Party branch secretary of Tianying Village, did not participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, but engaged in theater houses to share dividends and seek profits. Zhao Shifang, Secretary of the County Committee, said: "It is a general situation that rural Party members in Ping Shan County do not participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. This is the main reason for the backwardness of the mutual aid and cooperation movement." But why don't Party members participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations? It should be said that the main reason is the County Committee's neglect of leadership and education.

    Why does the County Committee neglect the leadership of the important socialist transformation cause? County Head Zheng Ruiping's words can answer this question. He said:
  "After planting cotton, implementing the planned supply of grain, and the agricultural patriotic production increase competition are also prominent centers. The central work is too busy, and the County Committee really doesn't have time to engage in mutual aid and cooperation." In this way, production and mutual aid and cooperation were placed in opposition, and the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation was relaxed. From June 11 to 17, Zhongjiabi Township received five types of forms issued by the county and district, including 73 items, with overlapping and complex content. Yan Yonglu, secretary of the township general branch, had to stay up until midnight. He said: "The higher authorities' arrangement of mutual aid and cooperation is empty talk, but the numbers to fill in the forms are real. It's still important to fill in the forms first."

    The Ping Shan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently made a grand plan to develop more than 2,000 cooperatives after autumn. If the County Committee's thinking of neglecting leadership of mutual aid and cooperation is not reversed, and specific leadership is not strengthened, the existing cooperatives will not be consolidated and improved, then the plan to develop cooperatives will definitely fall through, and it will definitely add difficulties and cause losses to the cause of socialist transformation of agriculture.

    为什么平山县有些农业生产合作社发生垮台和涣散现象
    振生　高奎
    河北省平山县是老解放区，党的基础较强，按理说互助合作运动应该有较大的成绩，事实上却不是这样。去年全县组织起来的农户占总农户百分之二十三点一，经过过渡时期总任务的宣传，今年只增加了百分之三；全县六十九个农业生产合作社，五个社垮了台，十四个社有社员退社，许多社不能巩固和提高。
    发生这些情况的原因，和中共平山县委忽视领导是分不开的。
    平山县委在今春建社时，领导思想上有分歧：前县委副书记李建修认为应该依靠农村党的组织，结合总路线总任务的宣传，大力领导建社工作；县委委员郑瑞平（县长）怕影响自己掌握的购粮和普选工作，认为社办多了没法领导。多数县委委员同意了郑瑞平的错误意见，在这种思想支配下，就把发展社的工作交给了少数干部去做。一月中旬抽出一般县区干部二十三人，到村里去直接找建社对象进行建社。因为县委没有抓紧领导，这些干部建社时抛开了乡、村党的基层组织，没有从提高农民的社会主义觉悟着手，结果建的社数量少，质量也低。如南滚龙沟李民署社建社时，区干部只找了个互助组动员动员，没有发挥党组织的作用。村支部书记王志太入社后，自留耕地百分之四十五，不起带头作用。这个社建立起来后不久就垮台了。三区区委副书记张树英在田营村，用允许大量贷款的方法建立起韩银来社，建社后因贷不到款，加上长期无人领导，社也垮了。社垮了一个多月，村支部还不知道。由于建社时思想基础差，建社后又缺乏具体领导，全县建了六十九个社，到四月份就有五个社垮了台。
    县委没有从领导思想上检查这些情况是怎样产生的，单纯地采取了分工包干的办法：全县六十四个社，把五十八个社包给了县、区干部。因为县委领导思想不重视，对干部没有进行深入的思想动员和具体指导，包社后并没有改变放松领导的情况。五个县委委员，有四个人包社后两个月没到社里去过。县长郑瑞平说：“我光管办公室的工作，工作太忙了，政府包的社已派能力强的干部管着呢！”实际情况却是，郑瑞平分工包了孟岭村社，派民政科科员任凤兰去领导，任凤兰对办社是外行，一听说去领导社哭了一场，民政科长动员了三天还是思想不通；到了社里也起不了领导作用。社里光搞副业，农业生产搞得很糟，现在社长崔金亭退了社，社快垮台了，郑瑞平也没设法解决。县领导干部包的社是这样，各部门包的社更不会好。县妇联会包了河村杜来娃社，长期没人过问。社内窝工现象严重，副社长说：“上级不帮助我们解决问题，社会主义道路怎么走呢！”
    县委把分工包社变成了推出不管。而且分工时不看条件，错误地叫银行、供销合作社等经济部门也包社；这些部门也得抽出干部，脱离业务去住社进行领导。县委没有统一领导，本部门又不检查督促，不少住社干部自由散漫，不积极工作。人民银行平山县支行包了郑家庄任寿田社，只四户，没什么问题，住社干部没什么事干，就每天看些京剧大全，看困了就睡。青年团县委会包了王母村李丑娃社，社里因窝工快要垮台了，团县委书记刘国治找中共县委书记赵世芳商量，赵世芳说：“咱们是明确分工，垮了你们负责。”不帮助解决问题，只是批评了一顿。县委思想上不重视办社，区委也就没有加强领导；各区也照县委的做法，把社包出去。中共三区区委书记左祥来说：“这一包社，咱们就减轻领导责任了。”把全区互助合作工作交给区委宣传干事周思义负责掌握。全县六个区，有四个区是组织委员或宣传委员负责掌握互助合作的。一区区委包了义羊村胡庆云社，胡庆云等把五百万元的牲口贷款分花了，社员贾连秋退了社，把社里的二亩七分棉花毁种成玉米，住社干部李明芳在这村住了两个月也不知道。由于县委没有认真贯彻“书记负责，全党办社”的方针，大大削弱了基层党组织在互助合作运动中的骨干作用。有些乡、村党支部见到农业生产合作社都由县、区干部包了，就认为领导社和自己没关系。中共孟贤璧乡总支书记刘汉杰说：“农业生产合作社由区里包了，咱又一点不懂，这一下可省心了。”古贤乡六十个党员，只有九个参加了互助组；十一个支部委员，只有两个参加了互助合作组织。有的党员，不但不积极领导农民走社会主义道路，还发展资本主义。阎常峪村党支部书记阎凤理和三个党员，还雇着长工；田营村党支部书记盖宗堂等干部不参加互助合作组织，却搞戏院子分红牟利。县委书记赵世芳说：“平山县农村党员不参加互助合作组织是一般情况，这是互助合作运动落后的主要原因。”可是党员为什么不参加互助合作组织呢？应该说主要是县委忽视领导和教育。
    为什么县委忽视领导重要的社会主义改造事业呢？郑瑞平县长的话可以答复这个问题。他说：
  “种完了棉花，搞粮食计划供应，农业爱国增产竞赛又是突出的中心，中心工作太忙了，县委真没工夫去搞互助合作。”就这样把生产和互助合作对立起来，放松了对互助合作的领导。中贾璧乡从六月十一日到十七日，接到县区发下的五种表格，包括七十三项，内容重叠复杂，乡总支部书记阎永禄一熬就是半夜，他说：“上级布置互助合作是一套空的，要数字填表格是实的，还是先填表要紧。”
    中共平山县委最近做了个秋后发展两千多个社的大计划。如果县委忽视领导互助合作的思想不扭转，不加强具体领导，现有的社得不到巩固和提高，那么发展社的计划一定会落空，也一定会给对农业进行社会主义改造的事业增加困难和造成损失。
