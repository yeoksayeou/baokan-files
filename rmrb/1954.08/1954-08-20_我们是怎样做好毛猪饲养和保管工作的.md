    How We Did a Good Job in Hog Raising and Storage
    Narrated by Pan Rui, Written by Liang Minzhi
    I used to work in the military, and last December I was transferred to the No. 1 Warehouse of the Changsha Hog Purchasing Office of the Hunan Provincial Company of the China Food Company to be responsible for hog raising and storage. Our warehouse has an average of about 1,000 hogs in pens for feeding and storage every day. Concentrated feeding of so many pigs means that if we are not careful with feeding and storage, they are very likely to die. However, thanks to the continuous attention of all our employees to improving feeding and storage work, the mortality rate of live pigs has gradually decreased. In December of last year, more than three out of every hundred hogs kept in the entire warehouse died, but by January of this year, it had been reduced to only 0.6 per thousand. In the first sixteen days of June, only two hogs died out of 20,000 hogs, and the mortality rate was further reduced to one in ten thousand, preserving a large amount of property for the country and powerfully supporting economic construction and the needs of people's lives.
    Not long after I was transferred to the No. 1 Warehouse, the phenomenon of a large number of hog deaths occurred here. I began to feel a little uneasy, feeling that this work was not easy to do. Comrade Sun Leran, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Food Company Branch of the Chinese Communist Party (manager of the provincial company), knew that I was feeling uneasy and immediately talked to me, encouraging me to actively study the business and find ways to overcome difficulties. At the same time, I also thought of the instructions given to me by the military leaders when I was transferred: you must still play a pioneering role when you are transferred to new positions. I quickly overcame this feeling of uneasiness and resolved to do a good job of the work assigned to me by the Party.
    When I first started this job, I thought to myself: if pigs are to grow fat and strong, it all depends on how well we feed them. So, I went deep into the ranks of the feeders to see how they fed the pigs, intending to work with them to study how to improve the feeding work. This was in December, and I found that the feeders all used cold water to mix the swill, and the green vegetables fed to the pigs were not washed clean, often containing mud, sand, and manure. Why didn't the feeders pay attention to these things? After talking with them, I learned that they had two ideas: one was that engaging in hog raising work was not very promising, and they held the attitude of "doing the job like a monk striking the bell," so feeding the pigs was just perfunctory, done irregularly; the other was that live pigs were originally a very dirty livestock, and it didn't matter much if they ate dirty things. I then explained to them that exporting live pigs was of great help to realizing the country's socialist industrialization, and told them that using cold water to mix swill or feeding pigs with unclean things would easily cause the pigs to get sick and die, which was the same as the principle that people would get sick if they ate unclean things. After I said this, the feeders accepted my suggestion and immediately changed to using boiling water to mix swill, washing the green vegetables used to feed the pigs clean. At the same time, the feeding time for the pigs was also set at twice a day from 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. In order to ensure the nutrition of the pigs, our warehouse also stipulated the amount of feed per pig per day. Now, all the pigs that have been kept in our warehouse for a month or half a month gain an average of one jin of fur and meat per day, and the most can gain one and a half jin of fur and meat.
      Each pig house in our warehouse is managed by two feeders. When feeding swill, one feeder takes turns driving the pigs in each pen to the feeding room to feed the swill, and the other feeder uses this time to rinse and clean the pig pens, and disinfect them with sanitary water, bleach, or lime water. Therefore, the pig pens in our warehouse are cleaned very cleanly, and it is difficult to see dirty things such as pig manure. Pigs living in such a clean place naturally rarely get sick.
      Our warehouse has also gradually paid attention to the prevention and treatment of diseases in live pigs, which has greatly reduced the mortality of live pigs. In the past, live pigs transported from various places were often not subjected to quarantine inspections, and good and sick pigs were fed in the same place. Therefore, some poor-quality or infectious pigs were prone to death or spread the disease to healthy pigs, causing a large number of deaths, especially the greater losses in December of last year. We learned a profound lesson from this and began to pay attention to the prevention and treatment of pig diseases. Three veterinarians and feeders inspected the live pigs transported from various places one by one in detail. If they found pigs with fever, listlessness, unable to walk, or dozing while walking, they immediately sent them to a specially set up pig house for feeding. Veterinarians often go to treat them, and now nearly 150 to 160 pigs are vaccinated every day. According to our statistics, a total of 932 pigs were cured in May, and 1,085 in June, all of which met the export standards. The 2,017 pigs cured for export in these two months alone amount to about 85 tons of net pork, which can be exchanged for 425 tons of steel or eight and a half tractors for the country.
    In addition to isolating sick pigs and poor-quality pigs, we also select the most experienced people to be responsible for feeding, and the mortality rate has also decreased. For example, the No. 1 pig house (a place where sick pigs and poor-quality pigs are concentrated) is fed and managed by Song Guicheng, an old feeder with more than ten years of feeding experience. In addition to paying attention to the daily cleaning and sanitation of the pig house, he also cares about the living conditions of each pig, grasps the general living habits of live pigs and the different living habits of each pig, and patiently feeds them. For example, when the pig swill is just cooked, he stays and adjusts it. When the weather is cool, he adjusts the swill to be slightly warmer; when the weather is hot, he adjusts the swill to be slightly cooler, and he crushes the broken rice and fine bran balls in the swill by hand to prevent the pigs from having difficulty digesting it. When feeding swill, he also concentrates on observing the swill-eating situation of each pig. If he finds pigs that don't like to eat swill, or pigs that are timid, afraid of people, or afraid of being bitten by fierce pigs and dare not approach the food trough to eat swill, he immediately marks the pig's back with blue water. Afterwards, he carefully studies the reasons why these pigs don't like to eat swill and dare not eat swill, and at the same time informs the veterinary personnel for treatment. In the evening, he also patrols the pig pens to see how the pigs are sleeping and how they are snoring. If there are any abnormal situations with some pigs, he also marks the pig's back and conducts research and treatment in a timely manner. In this way, although the No. 1 pig house feeds sick pigs and poor-quality pigs, there are very few deaths.
    In addition, when porters carry pigs to the warehouse, I also ask them to take care of the live pigs. Originally, when pigs were transported to Changsha by boat from various places, some porters were careless when stacking the pigs, often causing the pigs to fall into the river or on the ground, either drowning or breaking their legs; some people were impatient and liked to beat and rush the pigs when driving them, which easily damaged the health of the pigs and caused difficulties in feeding and storage. Knowing this situation, I often educate the porters who carry or drive the pigs, patiently persuading them and explaining that taking care of live pigs is taking care of national property and is an act of supporting national construction. Now, they pay more attention when carrying and driving pigs, and the situations of falling, drowning, and beating injuries have been basically eliminated. This is of great benefit to helping us do a good job in live pig storage.

    我们是怎样做好毛猪饲养和保管工作的
    潘瑞口述　梁敏之记
    我原来在部队工作，去年十二月被调到中国食品公司湖南省公司长沙生猪收购处第一仓库负责生猪饲养和保管工作。我们这个仓库，每天平均寄栏饲养和保管的生猪约有千余头。集中喂养这样多的猪，如果饲养、保管稍不留心，就很容易死亡。但是，由于我们全体职工，不断注意改进饲养、保管工作，逐步减少了生猪的死亡。去年十二月，全仓库保管的生猪，每百头要死三头多，到今年一月份便降低到每千头只死亡零点六头；六月份的头十六天中，两万头猪只死了两头，死亡率更降低到了万分之一，替国家保全了一大笔财产，有力地支援了经济建设和人民生活的需要。
    我调到第一仓库不久，这里便发生了生猪大量死亡的现象。我开始有些不安起来了，感到这工作不好搞。中共湖南省食品公司支部书记孙乐然同志
  （省公司经理）知道我情绪不安，马上找我谈话，鼓励我积极钻研业务，想办法克服困难。同时，我又想到转业的时候，部队首长对我的嘱咐：你们转业到新的岗位上，仍然要起先锋作用。我很快地克服了这种不安情绪，决心搞好党交给我的工作。
    初搞这个工作时，我心里想：猪要长得肥壮，全靠我们喂得好。于是，我就深入到饲养员中，看他们如何喂猪，打算和他们一道来研究如何改进饲养工作。这时正是十二月，我发现饲养员喂猪都用冷水调潲，猪吃的青菜也洗得不干净，里面经常夹着泥巴、砂子和粪渣子。饲养员为什么没注意这些呢？经我和他们谈话后，了解到他们存在这样两种思想：一是认为搞生猪饲养工作没多大出息，抱着“做天和尚撞天钟”的态度，喂猪也就马马虎虎，有一顿没一顿的；另一种认为生猪本来就是一种很脏的家畜，吃点脏东西没有大关系。我便向他们说明出口生猪对实现国家社会主义工业化有很大帮助，告诉他们用冷水调潲或用不干净的东西喂猪，猪吃了容易得病死亡，这和人吃了不干净的东西要得病的道理是一样的。经我一说，饲养员接受了我的建议，立即改用开水调潲，把喂猪用的青菜洗干净，同时喂猪的时间也确定为每天上午六时到十时和下午三时到六时两次。为了保证猪的营养，我们仓库还规定每头猪每天的饲料数量。现在，所有在我们仓库寄栏饲养了一月或半月的猪，每天平均长一斤毛肉，最多的可长到一斤半毛肉。
      我们仓库的每栋猪舍是由两个饲养员专责管理的。喂潲时，由一个饲养员分别把每个猪栏中的猪轮流赶到饲养房喂潲，另一个饲养员则利用这个时间，把猪栏冲洗和打扫干净，并用卫生水、漂白粉或石灰水消毒。因此，在我们仓库的猪栏里，打扫得干干净净，很难看到猪粪等肮脏东西，猪住在这样干净的地方自然很少害病。
      我们仓库也逐渐注意了生猪的防疫治疗工作，这更大大减少了生猪的死亡。过去，从各地运来的生猪，往往不经过防疫检查，好猪病猪同在一处喂，因此，一些品质差的或有传染病的猪，常易死亡或把病疫传染给健康的猪，造成大量死亡，尤其是去年十二月份的损失更大。我们接受这一深刻的教训，开始注意猪的防疫和治疗，由三位兽医和饲养员将各地运来的生猪一头头详细检查，发现有身体发烧、精神不振、走不动或边走边打瞌睡的猪，马上把它们送到专设的猪舍去饲养。经常由兽医人员去治疗，现在每天都要给将近一百五、六十头猪进行防疫注射。根据我们的统计，五月份治疗好了的猪共有九百三十二头，六月份有一千零八十五头，都全部达到了出口标准。光这两个月经治疗好了可供出口的二千零十七头猪，约有八十五吨净猪肉，能替国家换回四百二十五吨钢材或八部半拖拉机。
    对于病猪和品质较差的猪，除了进行隔离外，我们还选定最有经验的人负责饲养，死亡也就减少。如第一猪舍（病猪和品质不好的猪集中的地方）是由一个有十多年饲养经验的老饲养员宋桂成饲养管理，他除了注意猪舍的日常清洁卫生工作外，还关心到每头猪的生活情形，掌握生猪的一般生活规律和每头猪的不同生活规律，耐心地饲养，如猪潲刚煮好，他就守着调，天气凉快，便把潲调得稍为温热些；天气较热，便把潲调得稍为凉些，并用手捏碎潲中的碎米和细糠团，以免猪吃下去不好消化。喂潲时他还聚精会神地观察每头猪吃潲的情况，发现有不大爱吃潲的猪，或是胆小怕人、怕凶恶的猪咬而不敢近食槽吃潲的猪，他马上用蓝水在这头猪的背上打个记号。过后，他一面仔细研究这些猪不爱吃潲和不敢吃潲的原因，一面通知兽医人员治疗。晚上，他还到猪栏里巡视，看猪睡得怎样，鼾打得怎样，如果有的猪发生不正常的情况，他也在那个猪背上打个记号，及时进行研究处理。这样，第一猪舍虽然饲养的是病猪和品质差的猪，但死亡的却很少。
    此外，搬运工人抬猪到仓库来时，我也要他们爱护生猪。原先，当各地用船运猪来长沙时，在起堆时有些搬运工人工作粗心大意，时常把猪搞得掉在河里或掉在地上，不是淹坏了就是跌断了腿子；也有的人因为不耐烦，赶猪时喜欢猛打猛赶，这都容易损害猪的健康，造成饲养保管上的困难。我知道了这种情况，便经常向抬猪或赶猪的搬运工人进行教育，耐心说服他们，说明爱护生猪就是爱护国家财产，就是支援国家建设的行为。现在，他们抬猪和赶猪时都注意得多了，跌伤、淹坏和打伤的情况也基本上消除了。这对于帮助我们做好生猪保管工作是有很大好处的。
