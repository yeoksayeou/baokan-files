Beautiful Indonesian National Song and Dance Art
Li Ling, Deputy Head of the Central Song and Dance Troupe

The beautiful performances of the Indonesian Art Troupe in Beijing not only showcase the rich and colorful Indonesian people's art but also demonstrate the kind nature and love of peace of the Indonesian people. Through these artistic programs depicting the lives of the Indonesian people, the Chinese people have gained a better understanding of the Indonesian people, thereby further enhancing the friendship and care between the two peoples. As Premier Zhou Enlai said at the reception given by the Indonesian Ambassador to China to celebrate the ninth anniversary of Indonesian independence: "The recent visit of the Indonesian Art Troupe to China and the visit of the Chinese trade delegation to Indonesia both mark the increasingly close cooperation between China and Indonesia in economic and cultural fields."

Indonesian national song and dance is a mirror of the people's life and spirit. Many songs and dances express their sincerity, enthusiasm, kindness, virtues, health, optimism, and love of life.

The Candle Dance is one of the earliest folk dances in western Sumatra. The content of the dance depicts a girl (performed with a group of supporting dancers) who loses her engagement ring in the dark. She cherishes this memento so much and feels infinitely ashamed, yet she doesn't want her parents to know, so she lights candles and searches everywhere by their light. The dancers hold plates with lit candles on them, dancing gracefully to the rhythm of the music. The dancers' performance is profound; the girl's love for the person in her heart, her worry and anxiety about losing the gift, can be felt through the changes in the candlelight. The music also meticulously portrays this distressed state of mind. From this, we can appreciate the sincerity of Indonesian women's love and their pure and flawless virtues.

The folk dance "Taya U Gel" from Aceh, western Sumatra, depicts a group of Acehnese people going to the mountains to collect firewood. When they reach the mountains, they happily dance. Suddenly, it rains, and they have to rush home. This dance is somewhat similar to our Yangko dance, with brisk and graceful hand and waist movements, and many foot movements. The music is very bright, with cheerful and melodious tunes from the violin and flute in sections, combined with the fresh and lively dance of the farmers, expressing their love for life and joy in labor.

The "Gitanlin - Nirwadagawaja" dance, based on the religious epic "Mahabharata," depicts the struggle between good and evil. The story tells of a giant who, angered by the gods preventing him from proposing to a beautiful fairy, attempts to destroy "Dewas" (the land of the gods) as revenge. Arjuna, a national hero from Banda, feels a sense of justice and fights against the giant. Finally, he obtains a sharp little sword from Tabas and stabs the giant to death. The giant is decorated with a monster mask, and his dance is somewhat similar to Chinese classical martial arts opera. The actor uses rough and varied movements to express the giant's ferocious image, which is very distinctive. The hero performed by the actor is very kind, stable, witty, and brave. From this, we can also see the Indonesian people's love of good and hatred of evil, and their belief that good will surely triumph over evil.

Indonesia is a country that loves singing and dancing. Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi all have various kinds of national song and dance. During festivals or celebrations, people everywhere joyfully sing and dance. Their dances include folk dances, classical dances, and newly composed modern dances. Folk dances have light and lively movements, while classical dances are slower and gentler. The characteristics of the dances are meticulousness and elegance, mostly using the hands, head, and waist to express emotions. The gestures of the hands (including fingers, wrists, and arms) are rich and beautiful. Many emotions and things are expressed through "sign language." There is a dance called "Line Dance" (a kind of court dance) in which the head is held straight, the eyes do not look sideways, and the action depends entirely on the movement of the hands. From this, we can also see the importance they attach to the use of hands.

Their song and dance music is simple in form. The accompanying bands usually include "Gamelan" and light orchestras. "Gamelan" uses percussion instruments as its backbone, with the group of bowl-shaped copper instruments "Gong" and "Geduk" being the most important, capable of playing extremely complex melodies and simple harmonies, in addition to a set of xylophones of different sizes and various gongs and drums. Regardless of the size of the band (usually around twenty people, up to fifty), there is only one stringed instrument, the "Rebab," which resembles a large coconut fiddle. The light orchestra consists of a violin (formerly a coconut fiddle), a flute, and a few gongs and drums. The sound of the "Gamelan" is very harmonious, with a strong national character, and the performance is varied, sometimes lively and noisy, sometimes soft and quiet, with an extremely wide range of expression.

Most of the members of the art troupe are young students, but they all have a considerable level of artistry and perform very meticulously. For example, Siti Suwarni, the young female dancer who performs the "Gonggaran" dance, has been studying dance since she was six years old. In this dance, she uses various techniques to express several different characters and emotions. The first part of the dance expresses the love and affection of the daughter of the Prime Minister of Tuban for the hero Anyasmak, the second part depicts the frustrated mood of two warriors ordered to resist the enemy, and the last part portrays the defeated image of Meenak. This young actress can express these complex requirements with meticulous dance movements.

Similarly, the "Golek Zerendan" dance is also a song and dance that completely depicts psychological states. The actress Sultanti uses various "hand gestures" to express the girl's longing for her lover and her intense desire, which is also very moving.

The audience also loves the gorgeous and leisurely "Bagrena" dance, which is performed by a group of girls in brightly colored costumes. The actors' light and slow dances and the loud and rapid music create a strong contrast. When the singing begins, it is suddenly incomparably quiet, creating a different kind of artistic conception. It is said that the strong and powerful music expresses the patriotic spirit of the Sulawesi youth, while the light movements express the character of women, which is very interesting.

From this performance, we also see the new artistic creativity of the Indonesian people. They have not only preserved and developed national, folk, and classical song and dance but have also created many new types of dances. For example, the "Surindan" dance, the Butterfly Dance, and the Knight Dance are all developed based on the basic dance postures of Indonesian folk song and dance. The "Surindan" dance and the Butterfly Dance place more emphasis on the expression of the hands and head, and are gentle and beautiful. The Knight Dance is strong and lively. The actors Suhardjo and Gus Sidi Arjo show their excellent talents in their performances. They not only express various movements of knights and horses but also express the various moods and heroic and alert spirit of knights galloping in the wilderness, sometimes speeding swiftly with a bold and tense demeanor, sometimes taking a slow rest with a calm and pleasant mood. The movements are full of national characteristics. This new song and dance should be said to be very successful.

We thank the Indonesian Art Troupe for giving the Chinese audience such a beautiful performance and congratulate them on their greater success in performances in various parts of our country. (Attached pictures)

    优美的印度尼西亚民族歌舞艺术
    中央歌舞团副团长　李凌
    印度尼西亚艺术团在北京的优美的演出，不仅显示了印度尼西亚人民艺术的丰富多彩，也表现出印度尼西亚人民的善良的性格和热爱和平的信念。通过这些表现印度尼西亚人民生活的艺术节目，使得中国人民对印度尼西亚人民有更多的了解，从而进一步地增进两国人民间的友谊和关怀。正如周恩来总理在印度尼西亚共和国驻华大使为庆祝印度尼西亚独立九周年纪念日的招待会上的讲话中所说：“最近印度尼西亚艺术团来访问中国和中国贸易代表团去访问印度尼西亚，都标志着中国和印度尼西亚在经济方面和文化方面日益密切的合作。”

    印度尼西亚的民族歌舞，是人民生活和精神的一面镜子。许多歌舞都表现出他们真诚、热情、善良的美德，和健康、乐观、对生活的热爱。
    烛舞是苏门答腊岛西部最早的一种民间歌舞。舞蹈的内容是描写一个少女（演出时由一群少女衬舞），在黑暗中把自己的订婚戒指丢了，她是那么珍视这件纪念物，感到无限羞愧，又不愿父母知道，于是点上腊烛，借着火光到处找寻。舞者手托盘子，盘上点燃着腊烛，随着音乐节奏，优美地舞着；舞蹈者的表演很深刻，少女对自己心中人的爱恋，对遗失赠物的忧愁、焦急的心绪，从烛光的变化中可以感受出来，音乐也细致地刻划了这种苦恼的心境。我们从这里体会到，印度尼西亚妇女对爱情的真诚和她的纯洁无瑕的美德。
    苏门答腊岛西部阿齐地方的民间歌舞“塔雅·乌·格尔”舞，是描写一群阿齐人到山上打柴。他们到了山上，非常快乐地跳起舞来，忽然天下雨了，只好匆忙地跑回家。这个舞有点近于我们的秧歌舞，手和腰部的动作轻快而优美，足部动作不少，音乐非常明朗，一段一段的小提琴和笛子的欢快悠扬的调子，结合着农民们新鲜活泼的舞姿，表现出他们对生活的热爱和对劳动的喜悦心情。
    根据宗教史诗“马哈巴拉塔”编成的“吉丹林——尼尔瓦达加瓦加”舞，是表现善与恶的斗争，故事是述说一个巨人，由于神阻止他向一个美丽的仙女求婚而发怒，企图毁灭“德瓦斯”（即神之国）来作为报复。班达瓦地方的民族英雄阿由那因感于正义起而和巨人战斗，最后在塔巴斯那里得到了一把锋利的小剑，把巨人刺死。巨人是用怪兽面具装饰的，他的舞姿和中国古典武剧有些相仿佛，演员以粗犷而多样的动作，表现出巨人的凶恶形象，极富特性；演员所表演的英雄，则非常善良、稳定、机智和勇敢。从这里也可以看出印度尼西亚人民的爱善憎恶，看出他们对善良一定战胜丑恶的信念。

    印度尼西亚是一个爱好歌舞的国家，爪哇、苏门答腊和苏拉威西岛都有着各种各样的民族歌舞。每逢节日或庆典，人们到处欢乐歌舞。他们的舞蹈有民间舞、古典舞和新编的近代舞；民间舞的动作轻快活泼，古典舞较为徐缓柔和。舞蹈的特点是细致、典雅，多半用手、头和腰部来表现情感，手的（包括手指、手腕、臂）姿态丰富而优美，许多情感和事物都是“手语”表现出来，有一种叫“排舞”（宫庭舞的一种），头部伸直，目不斜视，专靠手的动作来描写，从这里也可以看出他们应用手的重要。
    他们的歌舞音乐，形式纯朴，伴奏的乐队普通有“加米兰”和轻乐队等种，“加米兰”以打击乐器为骨干，其中以像盅形的铜乐“哥昂”、“哥铎”一组为最主要，能演奏极复杂的旋律及简单的和声，另外有一组大小不同的板琴和各种锣鼓。不管乐队大小（普通是二十人左右，大的到五十人），弦乐器却只有一个像大椰胡的“露援”。轻乐队由小提琴（过去是椰胡）、笛子及少数锣鼓组成。“加米兰”的声音很融和，具有强烈的民族色彩，演奏变化很多，有时热闹喧天，有时轻声细语，表现幅围极宽。
    艺术团的团员，多半是青年学生，但都有相当的艺术水平，表演得很细致。如表演“贡加兰”舞的青年女演员西蒂·苏娃妮，她六岁就学习舞蹈，在这一舞蹈中，她以各种手法来表现几个不同的人物和情感，舞蹈第一段表现都班国首相的女儿对安雅斯玛克英雄的痴心和深情，第二段描绘两个受命抗敌战士的挫败心境，最后一段则刻划麦纳克被打败的形象。这位年青的女演员，能以细致的舞姿把这些复杂的要求表现出来。
    又如“哥勒克·泽伦丹”舞，也是一个完全描写心理状态的歌舞，女演员苏丹蒂以各种“手语”表现出那女孩子对情人的思念，和剧烈的渴望情感，也很使人感动。
    观众也喜爱那华丽而闲静的“巴格蕾娜”舞，这是由一群穿着鲜艳服装的少女表演的，演员们的轻盈缓舞，和响亮急速的音乐造成强烈的对比。到了歌唱时，突然幽静无比，另有一番意境。据说坚强有力的音乐是表现苏拉威西青年的爱国精神，轻盈的动作，则表现女性的性格，这是非常有意思的。
                    ×××
    从这次演出中，我们还看到印度尼西亚人民新的艺术创造力。他们不仅保存和发展了民族、民间歌舞和古典舞，而且创作了不少新型的舞蹈。如
  “苏琳丹”舞、蝴蝶舞、骑士舞等，都是根据印度尼西亚民间歌舞的基本舞姿发展出来的。“苏琳丹”舞、蝴蝶舞更多着重手和头的表情，柔和、秀美。骑士舞则健壮、泼辣；演员苏哈尔多和古苏第阿尔佐在表演上显出他们优秀的才能，他们不仅表现了骑士和马的各种动作，而且表现了骑士在原野上奔驰时的各种心情和英勇、机警的精神，时而急速飞奔，神貌果敢、紧张；时而缓步小憩，心绪闲静愉悦，动作富有民族色彩。这个新的歌舞，应该说是很有成就的。
    我们感谢印度尼西亚艺术团给中国观众这样优美的表演，祝贺他们在我国各地的演出获得更大的成功。（附图片）
