Xinhua News Agency, Paris: TASS reports: The French National Assembly is scheduled to discuss the "European Defense Community" treaty on August 28th. On August 24th, the cabinet held a meeting at which the Premier reported on the results of the Brussels Conference. On August 25th, the Premier reported on this issue at a joint meeting of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, the Defense Committee, and the Overseas Territories Committee.

The cabinet meeting on the 24th decided not to delay the National Assembly's discussion of the "European Defense Community" treaty and determined that the parliamentary debate would be based on the report by Socialist Jules Moch, which concluded that the bill on ratifying the treaty must be rejected. Another very important decision was that the issue of confidence in the government would not be raised during this discussion. Mendès-France said the government made this decision because it did not want to put pressure on the parliamentarians.

When reporting on the results of the Brussels Conference at the joint meeting of the parliamentary committees on August 25th, Mendès-France pointed out that previous French governments had not submitted the bill on ratifying the treaty to the parliament because there was no majority in the National Assembly to support it. Mendès-France also recounted that he had instructed to reconcile the opinions of the opponents and supporters of the "European Defense Community" treaty, but these efforts had failed. He said this situation prompted him to draft amendments to supplement the treaty. In his opinion, the treaty, after being amended, could be accepted by a majority of the members of the French parliament. Mendès-France said that this amendment had essentially been rejected by the other countries participating in the Brussels Conference, because if they accepted this amendment, they would have to reopen the debate in the parliaments of those countries that had already ratified the "European Defense Community" treaty (West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg).

Mendès-France then mentioned the so-called counter-proposal by Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak and said that the French delegation rejected Spaak's proposal, so the meeting failed to reach an agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: According to TASS, Paris: As the date for the French parliament to begin debating the Paris Treaty draws nearer, the French people's movement against arming West Germany under the guise of the "European Army" is gaining momentum.

According to "l'Humanité," an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who received a delegation of peace advocates from the Seine-et-Oise department on August 24th said that this delegation was the 150th delegation to demand the rejection of the policy of arming West Germany.

A campaign to collect signatures for a petition protesting the revival of the aggressive German Wehrmacht is underway nationwide. In the Bouches-du-Rhône department alone, 450,000 residents have signed, including twenty provincial councilors, forty municipal council members, and nine National Assembly members. In the Seine-et-Oise department, more than 120,000 people have signed the petition. Recently, four hundred large and small gatherings demanding the rejection of the "European Army" treaty have also been held here.

In four constituencies of the Saône-et-Loire department, public opinion polls were conducted, and the results showed that the mayors of forty-two out of forty-eight municipalities condemned the plan to establish the "European Defense Community." In the commune of Publier (Gironde department), mayors of various parties and factions demanded that parliamentarians vote against the ratification of any form of "European Army" treaty.

Many parliamentarians have expressed their determination to reject the Paris Treaty to delegations of working people. Gaullist parliamentarian Hüry (Haute-Marne) told railway workers in Chaumont: "Regardless of whether there are amendments or not, I will vote against the European Defense Community treaty. I agree that the Soviet Union's recent proposals (on holding negotiations on the German issue) must be studied." Radical Socialist parliamentarian Masson assured a delegation of workers from Digne-les-Bains (Alpes-de-Haute-Provence) that he would vote against the Paris Treaty. Parliamentarian Pirte (Independent Republican), Gisclée (Socialist), Dessano (Radical Socialist), and other parliamentarians have issued similar statements. Statements opposing the conclusion of a military alliance between France and the former Hitlerite aggressors have also been issued by: the French Women's Union, the Unified Socialist Party, the National Federation of Reserve Officers and the National Federation of Reserve Junior Officers, the French Republican Youth Union, and many other organizations.

    法国国民议会定二十八日讨论“欧洲防务集团”条约
    法国人民反对“欧洲军”的运动声势浩大
   【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国国民议会定于八月二十八日讨论“欧洲防务集团”条约。八月二十四日内阁举行会议，总理在会上报告了布鲁塞尔会议的结果。八月二十五日，总理在议会外交委员会、国防委员会和海外领地委员会的联席会议上就这个问题作了报告。
    二十四日的内阁会议决定不再推迟国民议会讨论“欧洲防务集团”条约的时间，并且决定议会辩论将以社会党人儒勒·莫克的报告作基础，这个报告的结论是：必须拒绝关于批准这个条约的法案。还有一个非常重要的决定是：在这次讨论中，将不提出对政府的信任问题。孟戴斯—弗朗斯说，政府所以这样决定是因为不愿对议员们施加压力。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯八月二十五日在议会委员会联席会议上报告布鲁塞尔会议结果时指出：法国以前各届政府都没有向议会提出关于批准条约的法案，这是因为国民议会中没有支持这个法案的多数。孟戴斯—弗朗斯还追述，他曾指示要调和“欧洲防务集团”条约的反对者和拥护者双方的意见，但这种努力失败了。他说，这种情况促使他拟订补充这一条约的修正案。在他看来，条约经过修正后，是能够被法国议会的大多数议员接受的。孟戴斯—弗朗斯说：这个修正案基本上已被参加布鲁塞尔会议的其他国家拒绝了，它们拒绝的原因是：如果接受这个修正案，就必须在那些已经批准了“欧洲防务集团”条约的国家（西德、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡）的议会里重新展开辩论。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯接着提到了比利时外交部长斯巴克的所谓反建议，并说，法国代表团拒绝了斯巴克的建议，因而会议未能达成协议。
   【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：随着法国议会开始辩论巴黎条约的日期日益逼近，法国人民反对在“欧洲军”的幌子掩盖下武装西德的运动也日益声势浩大了。
    据“人道报”报道，八月二十四日接见塞纳—瓦斯省的和平拥护者代表团的外交部官员说：这个代表团已经是要求拒绝执行武装西德的政策的第一百五十个代表团了。
    为抗议复活侵略性的德国国防军的请愿书征集签名的运动正在全国范围内进行着。单是在罗尼河口省，就已征集到四十五万居民的签名，其中包括二十个省议会议员、四十个市政委员会委员和九个国民议会议员。在塞纳—瓦斯省，请愿书有十二万多人签名。最近这里还举行了四百次要求拒绝“欧洲军”条约的大小集会。
    在索恩—罗亚尔省的四个选区里举行了民意测验，结果四十八个市镇中有四十二个市镇的市长谴责建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划。在普及莪地方
  （吉伦特省），属于各党各派的各市镇市长都要求议会议员投票反对批准任何形式的“欧洲军”条约。
    许多议员都对劳动人民的请愿代表团表示决心摒弃巴黎条约。戴高乐派议员许里（上马恩省）对旭蒙城的铁路工人说：“不管是不是有修正案，我都要投票反对欧洲防务集团条约。我同意必须研究苏联最近（关于就德国问题举行谈判）的建议。”激进社会党议员马松向提南城（下阿尔卑斯省）的工人代表团保证，他要投票反对巴黎条约。议员皮尔特（独立共和党）、纪斯列（社会党）、德萨诺
  （激进社会党）及其他议员都发表了类似的声明。发表声明反对法国和前希特勒侵略者缔结军事同盟的还有：法兰西妇女联盟、单一社会党、后备军官全国联合会和后备下级军官全国联合会、法兰西共和青年联盟和许多其他组织。
