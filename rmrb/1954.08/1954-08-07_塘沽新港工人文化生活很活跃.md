    The spare time of dockworkers and construction workers at Tanggu New Port is filled with joy and happiness.
    After the dockworkers finish unloading cargo from ten-thousand-ton freighters, and after the construction workers on the dredgers complete their day’s labor, the sports grounds, clubs, and recreation rooms at the New Port dock and construction sites become lively, and the loudspeakers begin to broadcast music. Some workers are engaged in tug-of-war, some in weightlifting, some in playing basketball, and some in playing volleyball or badminton. The horizontal bars and parallel bars are also crowded with people participating in sports. Dockworkers and construction workers at the New Port have already established eighteen teams for basketball, volleyball, soccer, etc., with more than two hundred team members. To meet the needs of the workers' participation in sports activities, a large stadium is currently being built in the New Port area, with six to seven hundred people participating in voluntary labor every day.
    The cultural life of the workers at the New Port is diverse. More than four hundred workers who love the arts have formed more than ten amateur arts organizations for Peking opera, Ping opera, drama, singing, and dance. They often perform for the broad masses of workers at cultural evening events. Since January, the construction workers have held nearly twenty such cultural evenings. The workers at the New Port can watch a movie once every week. Three film projection teams with five projectors regularly travel around to screen movies for the workers. From January to July, the three film projection teams screened nearly two hundred films. Workers also often hold dances; more than a thousand people participated in an open-air dance on the evening of July 21. Professional theater troupes from Tianjin also frequently come to the New Port to perform for the workers. In mid-July, the Tianjin People's Art Theater Song and Dance Troupe came to the New Port and performed song and dance programs for the workers for four days.

    塘沽新港工人文化生活很活跃
    塘沽新港的码头工人和筑港工人的业余生活充满着愉快和欢乐。
    当码头工人们装卸完万吨巨轮上的货物、当挖泥船上的筑港工人们劳动了一天以后，新港码头和工地上的运动场、俱乐部、游艺室就都热闹起来，广播器也开始放送音乐。工人们有的拔河，有的举重，有的打篮球，有的打排球，也有的打羽毛球，在单杠、双杠场上也都是参加运动的人群。新港的码头工人和筑港工人们已经成立了篮球、排球、足球等十八个球队，队员有二百多人。为了适应工人们参加体育活动的需要，新港地区现在正在修建一个大体育场，每天有六、七百人参加义务劳动。
    新港工人们的文化生活是多种多样的。四百多个爱好文艺的工人们组成了京剧、评剧、话剧、歌咏、舞蹈等十多个业余文艺组织，他们经常在文艺晚会上给广大的工人群众演出。从一月份以来，筑港工人举办的这种文艺晚会就有近二十次。新港的工人们每一个星期都能看到一次电影。有五部电影机的三个电影放映队经常巡回为工人们放映影片。从一月到七月，三个电影放映队就放映了近二百场电影。工人们还常常举行舞会，七月二十一日晚上的一次露天舞会，就有一千多人参加。天津市的专业剧团也经常到新港来为工人们演出。七月中旬，天津市人民艺术剧院歌舞团曾来到新港，为工人们演出了四天歌舞节目。（新华社）
