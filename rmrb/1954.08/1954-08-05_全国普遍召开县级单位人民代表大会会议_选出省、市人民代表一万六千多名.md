Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: With the completion of grassroots elections across the country, county-level People's Congress meetings were widely held in various regions during June and July. According to materials from the Central Election Committee, with the exception of six units in the provinces of Liaoxi, Jilin, and Hunan that are expected to conclude by early August, as of the end of July, People's Congress meetings have been completed in all province-administered cities, counties, districts of centrally-administered municipalities, and in prefectural-level and county-level autonomous regions in minority areas where conditions permit.

At the county-level People's Congress meetings, representatives diligently elected representatives to the Provincial and Municipal People's Congresses through secret ballot. According to statistics, a total of 16,807 representatives to the Provincial and Municipal People's Congresses were elected nationwide. Among these representatives are a large number of outstanding Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and model workers in industry and agriculture; various nationalities and democratic classes also have representatives elected in proportion to their status. These representatives have close ties with the broad masses of the people.

The county-level People's Congress meetings across the country discussed the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The people's representatives expressed their heartfelt support for the draft Constitution, and meetings in various regions generally passed resolutions supporting the draft Constitution. They believe that the draft Constitution not only summarizes the achievements of China's revolutionary victory, but also reflects the common aspirations of the broad masses of the people in building a socialist society. The People's Representatives of Macheng County, Hubei Province, unanimously resolved at the meeting to launch a month-long campaign to discuss the draft Constitution throughout the county. After the People's Congress meeting in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, more than 1,400 county and township people's representatives conveyed the resolution supporting the draft Constitution passed by the county People's Congress meeting to 80 percent of the voters in the county. Some people's representatives also specifically went to those remote mountain villages and shacks to explain the content of the draft Constitution, visiting elderly people who could not attend the meeting door-to-door, and soliciting their opinions on the draft Constitution. Through this discussion, various regions not only extensively solicited the opinions of the people but also greatly enhanced the people's sense of responsibility for caring about state affairs. The representatives said: Only in the new China do the people have the right to discuss the fundamental laws of the country.

The county-level People's Congress meetings across the country also generally reviewed the work of the People's Government and discussed future tasks. Based on their own personal experiences, the people's representatives pointed out the significant achievements made by the People's Government in various tasks in recent years, commended those outstanding cadres, and criticized the shortcomings in the government's work. This result of fully promoting democracy not only strengthened the relationship between the government and the masses but also truly enabled the People's Congress to play the role of a state power organ.

    全国普遍召开县级单位人民代表大会会议
    选出省、市人民代表一万六千多名
   【新华社四日讯】随着全国基层选举工作的完成，各地在六、七月间普遍召开了县一级单位的人民代表大会会议。根据中央选举委员会的材料，除辽西、吉林、湖南三省有六个单位延到八月上旬可以开完以外，到七月底止，在全国范围内，各省辖市、各县、中央直辖市的区和在条件具备了的少数民族地区内的专区级、县级自治区单位，已全部开完了人民代表大会会议。
    在各地县一级单位的人民代表大会会议上，代表们以无记名投票的方式，认真地选举了省、市人民代表大会的代表。据统计，全国选出的省、市人民代表共有一万六千八百零七名。在这些代表中，有大批优秀的共产党员、青年团员和工、农业劳动模范；各民族、各民主阶级也都有和它的地位相当的代表当选。这些代表和广大人民有着密切的联系。
    各地县一级单位的人民代表大会会议都讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案。人民代表们对宪法草案表示衷心拥护，各地的会议普遍通过了拥护宪法草案的决议。他们认为宪法草案不仅总结了我国革命胜利的成果，而且反映了广大人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望。湖北省麻城县的人民代表在会议上一致决议要在全县开展一个讨论宪法草案运动月。山西省平顺县在开过人民代表大会会议以后，一千四百多名县和乡的人民代表向全县百分之八十的选民传达了县人民代表大会会议通过的拥护宪法草案的决议。有些人民代表并特地到那些偏僻的山庄、窝铺去讲解宪法草案的内容，挨门逐户地访问那些不能参加会议的老年人，征求他们对宪法草案的意见。各地通过这次讨论，不仅多方面征求了人民的意见，而且大大提高了人民关心国家事务的责任感，代表们说：只有在新中国，人民才有讨论国家大法的权利。
    各地县一级单位的人民代表大会会议还普遍审查了人民政府的工作，讨论了今后的任务。人民代表们根据自己的切身经验，指出人民政府几年来在各项工作中所取得的重大成绩，对于那些优秀的干部提出表扬，对政府工作中的缺点提出了批评。这样充分发扬民主的结果，不仅密切了政府和人民群众的关系，而且真正使人民代表大会发挥了国家权力机关的作用。
