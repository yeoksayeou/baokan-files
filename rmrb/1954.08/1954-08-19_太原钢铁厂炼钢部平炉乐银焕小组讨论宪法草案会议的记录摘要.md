The people, with the active and responsible attitude of masters of the country, have put forward their opinions on the revision of the draft constitution. Through discussion, they have more clearly understood the spirit and content of the draft constitution, the close relationship between the draft constitution and themselves, and have supported the draft constitution with practical actions such as increasing production. Below are some excerpts of the discussions among workers.

Excerpts from the Record of the Discussion of the Draft Constitution by the Le Yinhuan Group of the Open Hearth Furnace Section of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant

Our Correspondent Chen Weiren, Liu Ye

Discussion Location: Near the Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Steelmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant;
Time: July 24th, morning;
Attendees: Cheng Xiangyun, Le Yinhuan, and 14 others from the Le Yinhuan Group of the Open Hearth Furnace Section of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant;
Chairman: Cheng Xiangyun (Secretary of the Party Branch of the Open Hearth Furnace Section of the Steelmaking Department).

Chairman: Comrades! It has been over a month since the draft constitution was published. Now everyone knows that the draft constitution was won by the Chinese people through more than a hundred years of heroic struggle, bloodshed, and sacrifice. It summarizes the achievements of our revolution and reflects the common aspirations of the people of the whole country. Last year, our Party Central Committee put forward the general line of the Party during the transition period. Under the brilliant light of the general line, we comprehensively and balancedly completed the state's production tasks for the first half of the year, bringing us closer to socialism. Today, the draft constitution clearly stipulates the future of socialism, listing the socialism we have longed for day and night as the legal goal for the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country.

Before the draft constitution is formally promulgated by the National People's Congress, the Central People's Government Committee calls on the people of the whole country to conduct discussions and put forward opinions on the revision of the draft constitution, so that our constitution can be more perfect. In the spirit of this, I hope comrades will speak enthusiastically and put forward your opinions.

Zhang Guangliang (Charging Driver): After the draft constitution was published, I listened to the three major reports in the factory, and I also read the document clause by clause. I feel that every clause is in line with the interests of the people. For example, Article 94 stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to education..." When I was a child, my family was very poor. Under the rule of Yan Xishan's bandit gang, we couldn't even get enough to eat. I barely finished a few years of primary school and dropped out. After liberation, the People's Government had people's scholarships, which allowed me to enter senior primary school. After graduating, I came to the steel plant to participate in the industrial construction of the motherland. In the factory, I can not only learn technology, but also attend the middle school class of the spare-time cultural school. It's really great! Now, the factory is also building a staff learning building, just as the draft constitution says, the state establishes and gradually expands various schools and other cultural and educational institutions to ensure that citizens enjoy the right to education. The state cares so much about the learning of workers. I am determined to study culture and technology hard and contribute more to the construction of socialism.

Ma Shoujin (Second-Level Gas Furnace Technician): Article 1 of the draft constitution stipulates that the working class is the leading class of the country; Article 2 stipulates that all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. I have the deepest understanding of these two articles. I am illiterate. Who would have looked up to someone like me in the old society! But now I am a representative of the people of Taiyuan City. I participated in the first session of the first People's Congress, participated in the discussion of state affairs, and reviewed the government's work report. This is truly the people being masters of the country. In the old society, I had never even heard of workers being representatives. In the Yan bandit (Yan Xishan) era, big and small officials bullied the common people. Now, the city's party and government leaders sit with us to discuss issues, and we can raise any opinions to them at any time. This congress gave me a profound democratic education. After returning, I thought: I am a gas worker. I can only produce more gas to ensure more steel production and accelerate socialist construction to repay the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

Zhang Meiqing (Second Helper Behind the Furnace): I have clearly realized that the socialist industrialization of the motherland must have democratization. As a worker in a state-owned factory, I have a particularly important responsibility to support the draft constitution with practical actions. Article 100 of the draft constitution stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China must abide by the constitution and laws, abide by labor discipline, abide by public order, and respect social morality." In the future, I must do it conscientiously, and I must resolutely obey the leadership in my work, unite the masses to do a good job in production and workshop hygiene, and never engage in localism.

Wang Chenghou (First Helper of Open Hearth Furnace): The fact that the draft constitution is to be discussed by every citizen makes me deeply feel that the power of the state truly belongs to our people. In the past, I heard that the Kuomintang had made a "constitution", but we never even saw a shadow of it. Now, we are not only the masters of the country, but also the masters of the factory. Article 101 of the draft constitution stipulates: "...Protecting and safeguarding public property is the duty of every citizen." In the past, our group also knew this, but we didn't protect it enough. In June, due to insufficient calculation of magnesia, loess, and ferromanganese, we prolonged the smelting time and produced less steel. Later, after group discussion, we found the problem and made a review at the production meeting of the whole workshop, and put forward a guarantee: to save raw materials and not waste a minute or a second. We must carry out our promise and treat our work with the attitude of masters of the country.

Yan Cuntang (Third Helper in Front of the Furnace): Article 6 of the draft constitution stipulates: "The state-owned economy is a socialist economy of ownership by the whole people, and it is the leading force in the national economy and the material basis for the state to realize socialist transformation. The state guarantees priority development of the state-owned economy..." We are workers in heavy industrial enterprises in the state-owned economy, and we are steel workers in heavy industry. Without steel, we cannot increase production, and we cannot build socialism. How important is our responsibility! Article 16 also stipulates: "Labor is the glorious thing for all able-bodied citizens of the People's Republic of China..." We are now working for the construction of socialism, no longer being slaves for others as in the old society. This makes me feel even more that I must overcome all difficulties and resolutely complete the task.

Qiao Qizhi (First Helper of Open Hearth Furnace): Article 89 of the draft constitution stipulates: The personal freedom of citizens is inviolable. During the rule of the reactionaries, people were beaten, scolded, and arrested everywhere, and there was no personal freedom. Landlord lackeys went to the countryside to collect rent, and whoever couldn't pay would be "circled" up at will. Puppet military police investigated household registrations, searched and beat people at will... These things can't be finished in days and nights.

Yao Antian (Worker): The draft constitution was obtained by countless revolutionary martyrs who gave their lives. I was in the Eighth Route Army. At that time, I climbed mountains to fight, in order to overthrow Japanese imperialism and make the people of the whole country live a happy and fulfilling life. Later, I transferred to the surveying team and the steel plant to work, and I often didn't do a good job. After learning the draft constitution, I realized that this was very wrong. In the future, I must abide by labor discipline and support the draft constitution with practical actions.

Gao Dewen (Duty Director, Shanxi Provincial Industrial Labor Model): My education level is low, and I bought a copy of the draft constitution but I can't understand it. But I have a radio at home, and I listen to the broadcast every day when I get off work. After studying the draft constitution, I remembered that I came from a poor peasant background and was illiterate, but now I am actually the duty director of a state-owned factory. In the cause of national socialist construction, I want to play a greater role in my post, learn more advanced Soviet experience, improve my technical level, and ensure more steel production.

Le Yinhuan (Stoker, Production Group Leader): After reading Chapter 3 of the draft constitution, I am really happy. Thinking about the past, we ate what others didn't eat, and we did the work that others didn't do. Looking at the present, the state has given us so many rights, eating health food, drinking soda, living in new dormitories, having safety equipment in our work, and being able to receive labor insurance and pensions when we are sick or too old to work. To be honest, we really have nothing to say, only to repay the state's care by working hard to produce and complete the state plan.

Chen Cainian (First Helper): I fully agree with the draft constitution. As Comrade Le Yinhuan just said, the state has given us the right to work, the right to rest, and the right to material security when we are old, sick, or lose the ability to work. If we make achievements in production, we will also receive material rewards. We have no other way to thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao except to use practical actions in production.

The discussion reached here, and the time had exceeded ten o'clock. The chairman briefly summarized everyone's discussion and announced a temporary adjournment.

    太原钢铁厂炼钢部平炉乐银焕小组讨论宪法草案会议的记录摘要
    本报记者　陈维仁、刘野记
    讨论地点：太原钢铁厂炼钢部平炉车间附近；
    时间：七月二十四日上午；
    出席：太原钢铁厂炼钢部平炉乐银焕小组的程相云、乐银焕等十六人；
    主席：程相云（炼钢部平炉党支部书记）。
    主席：同志们！宪法草案公布已经一个多月了，现在大家都已经知道宪法草案是中国人民一百多年来英勇奋斗流血牺牲所换来的。它总结了我国革命的成果，反映了全国人民的共同愿望。去年，我们的党中央提出了党在过渡时期的总路线。在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们曾经全面地、均衡地完成了国家上半年的生产任务，使我们又向社会主义接近了一步。今天，宪法草案明确规定了社会主义的前途，把我们日夜渴望的社会主义列为全国人民一致努力的法定目标了。
    在宪法草案未经全国人民代表大会通过正式公布前，中央人民政府委员会号召全国人民进行讨论，对宪法草案提出修改意见，以便我们的宪法更加完善。本着这个精神，希望同志们热烈发言，提出自己的意见。
    张光亮（装入司机）：宪法草案公布后，厂里的三个大报告我都听了，还逐条逐句读过文件。我感到条条都合乎人民的利益。比如第九十四条规定：“中华人民共和国公民有受教育的权利。……”我小的时候，家里很穷，在阎锡山匪帮统治下连吃的都弄不上，我勉强念了几年小学就失学了。解放后，人民政府有人民助学金，使我又入了高小。毕业以后，我就来钢铁厂，参加祖国工业建设。在厂里不光可以学技术，还可以上业余文化学校的中学班，真是太好啦！现在，厂里又正在盖职工学习大楼，正像宪法草案中所说的，国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，以保证公民享受受教育的权利。国家这样关心工人的学习，我决心好好学习文化和技术，为建设社会主义多出些力。
    马守金（煤气炉二级技师）：宪法草案第一条规定了工人阶级是国家的领导阶级；第二条规定了中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。我对这两条的体会最深了。我是一字不识的人，在旧社会谁看得起咱这号人！可是，现在我当了太原市的人民代表，参加了首届第一次人民代表大会会议，参加讨论了国家大事、审查了政府的工作报告，这真是人民当家作主了。在旧社会，工人当代表听也没有听说过。阎匪（阎锡山）时代，大小官吏都欺负老百姓，现在，市的党政首长们和我们坐在一起讨论问题，对他们有什么意见随时都可以提。这次代表大会使我受到了一次深刻的民主教育，回来后，我想：我是个煤气工人，只有多生产煤气保证多出钢，加快社会主义建设，来报答共产党、毛主席。
    张美卿（炉后二助手）：祖国要实现社会主义工业化必须有民主化，这一点我已经清楚地认识到了。我是一个国营工厂的工人，对于用实际行动来拥护宪法草案有着特别重大的责任。宪法草案第一百条规定：“中华人民共和国公民必须遵守宪法和法律，遵守劳动纪律，遵守公共秩序，尊重社会公德。”今后，我一定要认真做到，并且要在工作岗位上坚决服从领导，团结群众搞好生产和车间卫生工作，绝不闹本位主义。
    王诚厚（平炉一助手）：宪法草案公布后要每个公民讨论，这件事就使我深深感到国家权力真正是属于我们人民的。过去听说国民党搞过“宪法”，但我们连影子也没见过。现在，我们不但是国家的主人，也是工厂的主人。宪法草案第一百零一条规定：“……爱护和保卫公共财产是每一个公民的义务。”过去，我们小组也知道这一点，但爱护得不够。六月份，我们由于对镁砂、土灰、锰铁计算不周密，延长了冶炼时间，少出了钢。后来经过小组讨论，找出了毛病，并在全车间的生产会议上作了检讨，提出了保证：要节约原材料，不浪费一分一秒钟。我们一定要实行自己的诺言，以主人翁的态度来对待工作。
    阎存堂（炉前三助手）：宪法草案第六条规定：“国营经济是全民所有制的社会主义经济，是国民经济中的领导力量和国家实现社会主义改造的物质基础。国家保证优先发展国营经济。……”我们是国营经济中重工业企业里的工人，而且又是重工业中的钢铁工人，没有钢铁就不能提高生产，就不能建设社会主义，我们的责任多么重大呀。第十六条又规定：“劳动是中华人民共和国一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣事情。……”我们现在是为建设社会主义而劳动，再不像在旧社会里，给别人当奴隶。这更加使我感到必须克服一切困难，坚决完成任务。
    乔七只（平炉一助手）：宪法草案第八十九条规定：公民的人身自由不受侵犯。反动派统治时代，人民到处挨打受骂受拘捕，人身毫无自由。地主狗腿子下乡收租子，谁缴不上就随便给“圈”起来，伪军警调查户口随便搜查、打人……。这些事讲起来，几天几夜也说不完。
    姚安田（工人）：宪法草案是多少革命先烈拚了性命才争得的。我当过八路军，那时爬山头打仗，为的打倒日本帝国主义，使全国人民能过美满幸福的日子。后来我转业到测量队、钢铁厂来工作，常常吊儿郎当不好好干。学了宪法草案，我认识到这是非常错误的。以后，一定要遵守劳动纪律，用实际行动拥护宪法草案。
    高德文（值班主任，山西省工业劳动模范）：我文化程度低，买了一本宪法草案读不懂。可是我家里有收音机，我每天下班回家就收听广播。学习了宪法草案，我就想起自己是贫农出身，一字不识，现在居然也当了国家工厂的值班主任。在国家建设社会主义的事业中，我想只有在岗位上发挥更大作用，多学习苏联先进经验，提高自己的技术水平，保证多出钢。
    乐银焕（司炉、生产小组长）：读了宪法草案第三章，心里头实在高兴，想想过去人家不吃的东西咱们吃，人们不干的活咱们干；看看现在，国家给了我们那么多的权利，吃上保健饭、喝上汽水，住上新宿舍，工作中有安全设备，病了、年老不能工作了还能领到劳保金、养老金等。说实在的，咱们真没啥说的，只有以努力生产，完成国家计划来报答国家的关怀。
    陈才年（一助手）：我对宪法草案表示完全同意。像刚才乐银焕同志谈的，国家给了我们劳动权、休息权，以及年老、疾病或失去工作能力时的物质保障权，生产上有了成绩，还受到物质奖励。我们除了在生产中用实际行动来感谢共产党、毛主席再没有别的了。
    讨论到这里，时间已经超过十时，主席简要地总结了一下大家的讨论，宣布暂时休会。
