South Korea’s Rampant Actions Undermining Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission Work
Li Gao

Just as the American ruling clique summoned its lackey Syngman Rhee to Washington to plot new adventurous conspiracies, and indulged and encouraged Syngman Rhee to issue a sky-high warmongering clamor in the United States, the Syngman Rhee group's activities to undermine the Korean armistice have become even more frantic.

The South Korean special agent boss, Won Yong-deok, the commander of the Syngman Rhee government's military police, who directly implemented the American plan to sabotage the prisoner of war repatriation agreement and forcibly seize prisoners of war, publicly issued a "written statement" on July 30, attempting to undermine the armistice agreement. He arrogantly and illegally "ordered" the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to "immediately withdraw" from South Korea, and threatened to take "necessary actions" against them otherwise. The next day, Syngman Rhee also issued a formal statement in Washington, saying that his military police commander, Won Yong-deok, was "doing the right thing" and that he "will ask the United States to also agree to expel the representatives of the two communist countries monitoring the armistice." On the same day, the Syngman Rhee group even sent out a large number of special agent bandits to launch serious incidents simultaneously in designated ports such as Busan, Incheon, and Gangneung, opening fire to murder personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and threatening and insulting Neutral Nations inspection teams. According to American news agency reports, Syngman Rhee bandits in Busan fired two shots at four Polish and Czechoslovak personnel of the local Neutral Nations inspection team. In Incheon, 250 Syngman Rhee special agents held a "demonstration" threatening and insulting the Polish and Czechoslovak personnel of the local Neutral Nations inspection team. The same "demonstration" also occurred in Gangneung. When the Busan incident occurred, a U.S. Army major was "present" and shamelessly praised the special agents for being "very well organized." Taylor, the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, even maintained an attitude of encouragement of "not giving public attention" to this serious violation of the armistice agreement.

The Syngman Rhee group dares to take such lawless actions, openly attacking and threatening and insulting personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, attempting to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. This is clearly a premeditated scheme by the American ruling clique to further undermine the Korean armistice agreement and intensify the use of Syngman Rhee to create tension. According to a report by the United Press, the United Nations Command actually described this planned atrocity as a "dispute between South Korea and the communist side," attempting to evade its guilt. But this is impossible.

Since the Korean armistice, the United States has been constantly violating the provisions of the armistice agreement by illegally transporting reinforcements of war materials into South Korea in order to enhance its military strength in South Korea and expand the adventurous capital of the Syngman Rhee group. The Neutral Nations' monitoring work, especially the just efforts made by the Polish and Czechoslovak members to maintain the implementation of the armistice agreement, has long been regarded as a thorn in the side by American adventurers. Around the time of the Geneva Conference, the American ruling clique sent the warmonger Van Fleet to South Korea to plan a large-scale expansion of the Rhee puppet army, while launching a rampant slander campaign against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and threatening to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The American United Press publicly instigated Syngman Rhee on June 12, saying: If Syngman Rhee "wants to get the large amount of military assistance he needs, he must abolish and relax the restrictions in the armistice agreement on the import of guns and aircraft. Some people believe that non-compliance with the armistice agreement—except for ensuring a ceasefire—may be the next step to be taken." Under the instigation of the American ruling clique, the Syngman Rhee group also immediately echoed after the United States undermined the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference: South Korea "no longer considers itself obligated to abide by the Korean armistice agreement," and "the South Korean government will in the near future demand that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission cease its activities in South Korea."

The U.S.-Syngman Rhee talks held in Washington this time are a predetermined step by the United States to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice and create tension in Korea. The communique of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee talks openly stated that the policy of "unifying" Korea by Syngman Rhee should be continued, attempting to close the door to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. At the same time, it also stated that more detailed discussions would be held on plans to increase "aid" to expand the Rhee puppet army. According to reports from American newspapers and news agencies, the United States has decided to increase the cost of "aid" to Syngman Rhee to more than one billion U.S. dollars per year, and has reached an agreement with Syngman Rhee to strengthen South Korea's military strength, including jet aircraft, warships, and a reserve army.

Therefore, it is very clear that it is precisely because the United States has given Syngman Rhee such reckless "aid" that this South Korean "bloodthirsty person" (as the British "Yorkshire Post" called Syngman Rhee) has become increasingly unscrupulous in his reckless actions. It is precisely because the United States is eager to transport a large number of reinforcement equipment of jet aircraft, warships, and equipping a reserve army to Syngman Rhee that the U.S.-Syngman Rhee group is eager to further undermine and abolish the Neutral Nations monitoring work in Korea.

The peace-loving people of the world and every country that cares about the stability of the Korean armistice situation and is willing to continue seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue will never allow the conspiracy plan of the Washington U.S.-Syngman Rhee talks and their illegal actions of attacking and threatening the Polish and Czechoslovak personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

The Syngman Rhee group's violations against the Neutral Nations monitoring personnel are clearly just one measure of the huge conspiracy of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee collusion to threaten the Korean armistice. This conspiracy must be completely defeated. The just work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission must continue and be protected by both sides. Article 13(c) of the Korean Armistice Agreement clearly stipulates that the two sides of the armistice shall "give full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation" to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its inspection teams in carrying out their duties and tasks at designated ports; Article 13(d) further stipulates that both sides guarantee that all members and other personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission "shall enjoy the freedom and convenience necessary for the proper performance of their duties." The United States must bear full responsibility for the illegal actions of the South Korean Syngman Rhee group in undermining the armistice agreement and insulting and threatening the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and the consequences arising therefrom.

    南朝鲜破坏中立国监察工作的狂妄行动
    李高
    正当美国统治集团把它的走狗李承晚召到华盛顿去布置新的冒险阴谋，并且纵容和鼓励李承晚在美国发出漫天的好战叫嚣的时候，李承晚集团破坏朝鲜停战的活动就变得更加疯狂了。
    南朝鲜的特务头子、直接执行美国破坏战俘遣返协议、以武力劫夺战俘计划的李承晚政府宪兵司令官元容德，在七月三十日公开发表了一项企图破坏停战协定的“书面声明”，狂妄地非法“命令”中立国监察委员会的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员“立即撤出”南朝鲜，并威胁说：否则就要对他们采取“必需的行动”。第二天，李承晚也在华盛顿发表正式声明，说他的宪兵司令官元容德是“做得对的”，他“将要求美国也同意把监察停战的两个共产党国家代表驱逐出去”。同一天，李承晚集团竟派出大批特务匪徒，同时在釜山、仁川、江陵等特定口岸发动开枪谋杀中立国监察委员会人员和威胁、侮辱中立国视察小组的严重事件。据美国通讯社消息，釜山的李承晚匪徒向驻当地中立国视察小组的四名波兰、捷克斯洛伐克人员连发两枪。仁川有二百五十名李承晚特务举行了威胁和侮辱当地中立国视察小组波、捷人员的“示威”。在江陵也发生了同样的“示威”事件。釜山事件发生时还有美军少校“在场”，并无耻地公开称赞特务们“组织得确实很好”。美国侵朝军第八军军长泰勒也居然对此严重违反停战协定的暴行保持“不予公开注意”的怂恿态度。
    李承晚集团敢于采取这种无法无天的行动，公然袭击和威胁、侮辱中立国监察委员会人员，企图破坏中立国监察委员会，这显然是美国统治集团蓄谋进一步破坏朝鲜停战协定、加紧利用李承晚来制造紧张局势的一个预谋。据合众社的报道，联合国军司令部竟把这种有计划的暴行说成是“南朝鲜—共方之间的纠纷”，企图逃避它的罪责。但这是办不到的事。
    从朝鲜停战以来，美国为了增强其在南朝鲜的军事实力和扩大李承晚集团的冒险资本，就一直不断地违反停战协定的规定，将增援性作战物资非法运入南朝鲜。中立国的监察工作，特别是波兰、捷克斯洛伐克委员为维护停战协定的实施而作的公正的努力，早就被美国冒险家们视同眼中钉。在日内瓦会议召开前后，美国统治集团一面派出好战分子范佛里特到南朝鲜去策划大规模扩充李伪军，一面对中立国监察委员会发动了嚣张的诽谤运动，并扬言要取消中立国监察委员会。美国合众社在六月十二日公然教唆李承晚说：如果李承晚“要得到他所需要的大量军事援助，必须废止与放宽停战协定中对运入枪炮与飞机的限制。某些人士相信：不遵守停战协定——除了保证停火以外——也许便是要采取的下一步骤。”在美国统治集团的策动下，李承晚集团也在美国破坏日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论之后立即应声叫喊：南朝鲜“不再认为有义务遵守朝鲜停战协定”、“南朝鲜政府在最近将来将要求中立国监察委员会停止其在南朝鲜的活动。”
    这次在华盛顿举行的美李会谈，就是美国为了维持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，制造朝鲜紧张局势的一个预定步骤。美李会谈的公报公然说要继续执行由李承晚“统一”朝鲜的政策，企图关死和平解决朝鲜问题的大门，同时还说要就增加“援助”以扩充李伪军的计划进行更详细的讨论。据美国报纸和通讯社的透露，美国已决定将“援助”李承晚的费用增加到每年十亿美元以上，并且和李承晚达成了一项加强南朝鲜军力的协议，内容包括喷气式飞机、军舰和一支后备陆军。
    因此，十分明显，正是因为美国这样不顾后果地给予李承晚以“援助”，才使得这个南朝鲜的“嗜血者”（英国“约克郡邮报”对李承晚的称呼）日益无所顾忌地胡作非为。正是因为美国急于要把“援助”李承晚的喷气式飞机、军舰以及武装一支后备陆军的大量增援装备运到南朝鲜去，才使得美李集团急于要进一步破坏和取消朝鲜的中立国监察工作。
    全世界爱好和平的人民以及每一个关心朝鲜停战局面的稳定、愿意继续谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决的国家，对华盛顿美李会谈的阴谋计划，以及它们袭击和威胁中立国监察委员会波兰、捷克斯洛伐克人员的非法行动，是决然不能容许的。
    李承晚集团对中立国监察人员的侵犯行为，显然只是美李合谋威胁朝鲜停战的巨大阴谋的一个措施。这个阴谋必须予以彻底击败。中立国监察委员会的公正工作必须继续下去并受到双方的保护。朝鲜停战协定第十三款午项明文规定：停战双方对中立国监察委员会及其视察小组在指定的口岸进行其职司与任务时，应“给予充分保护及一切可能的协助与合作”；第十三款酉项又规定：双方保证中立国监察委员会所有委员及其他人员“均享有为适当执行其职司所必需的自由与便利”。美国方面必须对南朝鲜李承晚集团破坏停战协定，侮辱和威胁中立国监察委员会人员的非法行动及其所产生的后果，负完全的责任。
