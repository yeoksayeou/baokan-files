The First Session of the First Guangdong Provincial People's Congress sent a telegram of condolence to the workers, peasants, People's Liberation Army soldiers, students, and government employees engaged in flood prevention and rescue work along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. It also decided to increase late rice production by 1.3 billion jin to support compatriots in disaster areas. The telegram stated: The floodwaters of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers have risen sharply, exceeding the highest water levels in previous years. However, thanks to your leadership under the Party committees and the People's Government, you have bravely and tenaciously fought against the floods day and night, regardless of hardship and fatigue, thus ensuring the safety of the people and industrial and agricultural production on both sides of the rivers. This is a great victory in defending socialist construction. Behind you is the active support of the broad masses of people throughout the country, so your struggle will surely achieve final victory.

The telegram also stated: In addition to extending our heartfelt condolences to your struggle, the people of Guangdong have decided to support you and our compatriots in the disaster areas with the practical action of striving to increase late rice production by 1.3 billion jin. We hope you will continue your efforts to finally overcome the floods, protect production and construction, and protect the safety of the people's lives and property.

    广东省人民代表大会电慰江淮防汛人员
    全省争取晚造增产粮食十三亿斤支援灾区
    广东省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议致电慰问长江、淮河防汛抢险的工人、农民、人民解放军、学生与机关工作人员，并决定以争取晚造增产粮食十三亿斤来支援灾区同胞。电文说：长江、淮河洪水高涨，超过历年最高水位。但由于你们在各级党委和人民政府领导下，不避艰险，不辞劳苦，夜以继日地和洪水作英勇顽强的斗争，使江河两岸的城乡人民及工农业生产因而获得安全。这是保卫社会主义建设的伟大胜利。在你们后面，有着全国广大人民群众的积极支持，因此，你们的斗争必将取得最后胜利。
    电文又说：广东人民除了对你们的斗争致以衷心的慰问外，并决定以争取晚造增产粮食十三亿斤的实际行动支援你们和灾区同胞。希望你们再接再厉，为最后战胜洪水，保卫生产建设，保卫人民生命财产安全而斗争。　（本报武汉记者站）
