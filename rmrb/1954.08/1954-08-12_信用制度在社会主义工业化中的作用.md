    The credit system is of great significance for socialist construction. Marx pointed out in "Das Kapital" that "in the transformation from the capitalist mode of production to the mode of production of combined labor, the credit system will act as a powerful lever" [Note 1]. Lenin also believed that large banks are the "state apparatus" necessary for realizing socialism, and "without large banks, socialism cannot be realized" [Note 2].
    Realizing socialist industrialization is a basic link in socialist construction. To realize socialist industrialization, billions of funds must be mobilized and allocated to industry. The state's powerful tools for mobilizing and allocating funds are the state budget and the credit system. The state budget plays a decisive role in mobilizing and allocating funds. In the Soviet Union's first five-year plan, more than two-thirds of the funds mobilized according to the financial plan were distributed and redistributed through the budget. The credit system also plays a certain role. It can gather the monetary funds and monetary accumulation temporarily idle in the reproduction process of enterprises that cannot be mobilized by budgetary methods, the temporarily floating funds and reserve funds of the state budget, and the monetary savings in the hands of the people through credit methods, and use these funds to meet the needs of socialist industrialization, especially the needs of heavy industry, under the conditions of repayment.
    Therefore, in order for the state to fully and flexibly utilize all state funds to realize socialist industrialization, it must organically combine the budgetary methods and credit methods of mobilizing and allocating funds, and must regard the credit system as an indispensable tool for realizing socialist industrialization. When discussing the issue of capital accumulation for industrialization, Stalin pointed out: "It is necessary to prevent the excessive accumulation within the country from being dispersed, but to concentrate it in our cooperative and state credit institutions... so as to use them primarily for the needs of industry" [Note 3].
    During the period of socialist industrialization, the Soviet Union achieved great success in using the credit system to mobilize industrialization funds. At the beginning of socialist industrialization, long-term credit had greatly increased. From 1926 to 1929, it increased more than thirteen times, the most important part of which was invested in industry. On the other hand, as the scale of industrial construction expanded and the needs of production and circulation for funds also increased accordingly, short-term credit also grew rapidly. From October 1925 to October 1929, the total amount of short-term credit investment provided by the State Bank almost tripled, while short-term credit investment in heavy industry almost increased sixfold. From these figures, we can see the significant role played by the credit system in building socialist industry.
    Precisely because the credit system has such a role, Stalin pointed out when summarizing the experience of Soviet socialist industrialization: "In this regard, the nationalization of industry and banks has greatly helped us, enabling us to quickly gather huge amounts of funds and transfer them to heavy industry." [Note 4]
    In order to ensure the realization of socialist industrialization, it is necessary to develop agriculture correspondingly while developing socialist industry, and to carry out socialist transformation of the scattered individual peasant economy through the path of collectivization. The development of agricultural production and the promotion of agricultural collectivization also require state credit assistance. During the period of socialist industrialization, the Soviet Union promoted agricultural production, especially the development of collective farms, through the credit system according to the needs of industrialization. From 1925 to 1928, bank agricultural loans increased nearly fivefold, among which the increase in loans to collective farms was the most significant.
    With the progress of socialist industrialization, it is necessary to continuously seek new sources of funds within the national economy. Therefore, it is necessary to practice strict economy throughout the country and promote the economic accounting system in all state-owned enterprises. In order to achieve the above objectives, it is necessary to implement a credit system for monetary supervision of the national economy.
    At the beginning of socialist industrialization in the Soviet Union, commercial credit still widely existed in the national economy. This credit played a positive role in mobilizing funds to restore production and fighting against capitalist economic components during the period of national economic recovery. However, this is a method of blindly allocating funds, which can confuse the path of credit circulation and directly hinder the implementation of the enterprise economic accounting system. Therefore, in January 1930, in order to consolidate the economic accounting system and strengthen the State Bank's role of ruble supervision, the Soviet government passed the "Resolution on Credit Reform." The main contents of this resolution are as follows:
    (1) Abolish commercial credit and replace it with direct bank credit.
    (2) Concentrate all short-term credit in the State Bank, making the State Bank the only credit center in the national economy.
    (3) Make the State Bank the only clearing center for allocation and settlement in the national economy.
    Regarding the significance of credit reform, Stalin said: "Rational organization of the credit business and correct utilization of monetary savings are of great significance for the development of the national economy. The measures taken by the Party to solve this problem are aimed at the following two aspects: concentrating all short-term credit business in the State Bank; implementing a clearing system for allocation and settlement in the public economy sector. Thus, first, the State Bank has become a national agency for statistical product production and distribution; second, a large amount of currency has been freed from the scope of circulation. There is no doubt that these measures will (and have already) promote the rectification of the entire credit business and the consolidation of our finances." [Note 5]
    The role of the Soviet credit system in socialist industrialization is roughly as described above.
    Our country is currently gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization, and there is no doubt that the credit system also has great significance for this cause.
    Our country's credit system is a unified and centralized credit system with the People's Bank of China as the main body. The nature and tasks of our country's state banks, as Lenin said, are "an institution necessary for the realization of socialism," "a national statistical agency for product production and distribution," and "a backbone of socialism." Our country's private banks have also been unified into joint state-private banks in the advanced form of state capitalism according to the needs of the state. Credit cooperative organizations in our country's rural areas are also becoming a powerful force. The current stage of China's credit system is composed of a strong state bank, a unified joint state-private bank, and extensive credit cooperative organizations.
    In the process of gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization, our country's credit system must take various effective measures to meet the needs of industry (the principle that the state bank's credit first meets the needs of industry refers to the entire period of socialist industrialization. In fact, at the beginning of socialist industrialization in our country, due to several specific factors such as economic construction and capital allocation turnover, the proportion of commercial loans was greater than the proportion of industrial loans). It must also use a large amount of funds to help the development of agricultural and handicraft production and promote the realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts. In addition, the credit system must also promote the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, especially to support this policy from the perspective of developing industrial production. At the current stage, for joint state-private industries, different conveniences and preferential treatment should be given in terms of loan conditions, interest rates, and other aspects compared to private industries, depending on the different actual situations. For private industries developing into joint state-private enterprises, loan conditions can be relaxed compared to private industries. For private industries processing and ordering goods for the state, loans can also be granted when necessary, under the principle of fully utilizing their own funds. When implementing the state's credit policy for private industry and commerce, state banks should pay attention to using the strength of joint state-private banks.
    During the period of socialist industrialization, as the scale of production and circulation continues to increase, the need for state bank credit in various sectors of the national economy, especially the industrial sector, also increases accordingly. What sources of funds does the state bank rely on to meet this ever-growing need of the entire national economy, especially the industrial sector?
    The issuance of currency is certainly one of the important sources of funds for the State Bank, but the increase in currency issuance must be adapted to the needs of the circulation sector for the increase in the amount of currency, and this source is limited. Therefore, the main source of funds for the State Bank is not the issuance of currency, but relies on absorbing funds, namely the funds floating in the state budget accounts, the funds in the current accounts of agencies and groups, the funds in the settlement accounts and settlements of economic organizations, and the savings of the people. The above-mentioned absorbed funds play different roles: the funds in the budget accounts are constantly increasing with the rapid increase in the scale of state budget revenue and expenditure during the period of socialist industrialization, and therefore it is a more important and regular source of funds for the State Bank. People's savings are constantly increasing with the increase in the income of the working people, and it can also become a regular source of funds for the State Bank, but these funds are scattered in the hands of many urban and rural residents, and various measures must be taken to mobilize them. The funds of economic organizations also increase with the expansion of the scale of industrial production and the increase in the number of newly built and rebuilt enterprises, but during the period of socialist industrialization, especially in the early stage of industrialization, many existing industries mainly expand the scale of production on the original basis through the rational use of funds, and therefore there may be stagnation or even a decrease in the speed of deposit increase. The fact that the proportion of industrial deposits in the State Bank in the Soviet Union fell from 16% to 15% from 1926 to 1929 can prove this situation.
    The funds for socialist industrialization not only rely on the above-mentioned method of "opening up sources," but also need to be solved by rationally organizing the credit business.
    Rationally organizing the credit business means rationally allocating funds to meet the needs of the national economy for funds in the process of industrialization. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the supervision of enterprises' economic activities through credit relations in order to promote enterprises to rationally use funds, accelerate capital turnover, reduce costs, and increase accumulation.
    Giving play to the State Bank's supervisory role over enterprises' daily economic activities is of great significance for ensuring and accelerating the realization of socialist industrialization.
    As mentioned above, in order to give full play to the State Bank's supervisory role over enterprises, it is necessary to change the credit relationship in the national economy, especially the credit relationship between state-owned enterprises and cooperatives. That is to say, it is necessary to abolish commercial credit in the socialist economy in a planned and step-by-step manner and replace it with the credit of the State Bank. The "Measures for the Implementation of Currency Management" promulgated by the State Council at the end of 1950 were aimed at abolishing commercial credit in the state-owned economy and cooperative economy, and concentrating all short-term credit in the State Bank in order to ensure that the credit system plays a supervisory role in the cause of socialist industrialization.
    To give play to the credit system's supervisory role over the daily activities of economic organizations, the important thing is to strengthen the direct credit link between the State Bank and enterprises.
    During the period of national economic recovery, about 60% to 65% of the State Bank's loans to state-owned enterprises were granted according to a centralized procedure, that is, the funds were first distributed to various ministries, bureaus, or general companies, and then distributed by them to the subordinate industrial and mining enterprises and trade organizations. It is difficult for this method to strengthen the direct link between the State Bank and enterprises, and it is difficult for the State Bank to fully play its supervisory role over enterprises. Since state-owned enterprises implemented the clearing of assets and verification of capital and began to turn to the economic accounting system, this situation has improved, and many factories and mines have established direct credit links with banks. In 1953, the state-owned commercial sector also began to implement the economic accounting system, and with the decentralization of funds in the commercial sector, the State Bank also began to establish direct credit relations with provincial companies and many grassroots organizations. This measure has undoubtedly taken the State Bank's supervision of enterprises a step forward.
    Direct credit from the State Bank to enterprises implementing economic accounting is a necessary step to give play to the bank's supervisory role over enterprises. But to fully and powerfully play this role, it is necessary to improve the credit method.
    According to the organizational and operational characteristics of various sectors of the national economy, the People's Bank of China has absorbed the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and has begun to formulate new credit methods that meet the requirements of national economic development according to the purpose of credit. According to the specific situation of enterprises, creating conditions to gradually promote scientific credit methods in state-owned enterprises, gradually implementing the principles of planning, purpose, repayment, time limit, and material guarantee of state bank credit, and giving full play to the credit system's daily supervision of the production and circulation process of the national economy are important tasks of the State Bank in the future.
    In summary, we can see that the role of the credit system in the country's socialist industrialization is very important. Strengthening the credit system can promote the rapid development of socialist industrialization. Therefore, during the period of socialist industrialization, not only should all credit institutions give full play to their role, but also party organizations at all levels and government economic departments, as well as the broad masses of the people, should strive to support various credit work so that it can serve socialist industrialization well.

    信用制度在社会主义工业化中的作用
    萧清　程曙光
    信用制度对于社会主义建设是具有重大意义的。马克思在“资本论”中曾指出：“在由资本主义生产方式到共同结合劳动的生产方式的转变中，信用制度会当作一个有力的杠杆来发生作用”〔注一〕。列宁也曾认为大银行是实现社会主义所必需的“国家机关”，“没有大银行，社会主义是不能实现的”〔注二〕。
    实现社会主义工业化，是社会主义建设的基本环节。要实现社会主义工业化，必须动员和分配亿万资金到工业中去。国家借以动员和分配资金的强有力工具，有国家预算和信用制度两种。国家预算在动员和分配资金中起着决定的作用。在苏联第一个五年计划中，按照财政计划动员起来的资财，就有三分之二以上经过预算进行分配和再分配。信用制度也起一定的作用，它能够按照信用的方法，把那些用预算方法所不能动员的企业在再生产过程中所暂时腾闲出来的货币资金与货币积累、国家预算暂时浮存的资金和后备资金，以及人民手中的货币积蓄等汇集起来，并且把这些资金按照归还性的条件，用在满足社会主义工业化的需要，特别是重工业的需要上去。
    因此，国家要完满地、灵活地运用国家的一切资财来实现社会主义工业化，就必须把动员和分配资金的预算方法和信用方法有机地结合起来，必须把信用制度看作是实现社会主义工业化不可缺少的工具。斯大林在论及工业化资金的积累问题时，曾指出：“必须使国内超额的积累不分散开来，而集合于我们合作社的和国营的信贷机关……，以便把它们首先用于工业底需要”〔注三〕。
    苏联在社会主义工业化时期，运用信用制度来动员工业化资金，曾获得了很大的成就。在社会主义工业化开始时，长期信贷就已大大增加。从一九二六年到一九二九年，就增加了十三倍之多，其中最主要部分是投到工业中去。另一方面，由于工业建设的规模日益扩大，生产与流通对资金的需要也相应地扩大，因而短期信贷也迅速增长了。从一九二五年十月到一九二九年十月，国家银行提供的短期信用投资总额几乎增加了三倍，而对重工业的短期信用投资则差不多增加到六倍。从这些数字，我们就可以看出信用制度在建设社会主义工业中所起的重大作用了。
    正因为信用制度具有这样的作用，所以斯大林在总结苏联社会主义工业化的经验时，曾指出：“在这方面，工业和银行国有制大大帮助了我们，使我们能够迅速聚集巨量资金，转用到重工业方面去。”〔注四〕
    为了保证社会主义工业化的实现，必须在发展社会主义工业的同时，相应地发展农业，通过集体化的道路，对分散的个体农民经济实行社会主义改造。发展农业生产和促进农业的集体化，同样也需要国家的信用援助。苏联在社会主义工业化时期，就曾按照工业化的需要，通过信用制度来促进农业生产，特别是集体农庄的发展。在一九二五年到一九二八年中，银行的农业贷款增加了将近五倍，其中以对集体农庄贷款的增加为最显著。
    随着社会主义工业化的进展，在国民经济内部要不断寻求新的资财来源。因此，在全国范围内厉行节约，在一切国营企业中推行经济核算制等就成为必要。为达到上述目的，实行信用制度对国民经济的货币监督，就很有必要。
    苏联在社会主义工业化开始时，商业信用还在国民经济中普遍地存在着。这种信用在国民经济恢复时期中，对动员资金来恢复生产以及和资本主义经济成份作斗争等方面，曾起了积极的作用。但这是一种盲目分配资金的方法，它能混乱信用流通的道路，直接妨害企业经济核算制的推行。因此，在一九三○年一月，苏联政府为了巩固经济核算制，加强国家银行的卢布监督作用，就通过了“关于信用改革的决议”。这个决议的主要内容如下：
    （一）取消商业信用，代之以直接的银行信用。
    （二）把一切短期信用都集中在国家银行，使国家银行成为国民经济中唯一的信贷中心。
    （三）使国家银行成为国民经济中唯一的划拨结算中心。
    关于信用改革的意义，斯大林这样说：“合理组织信贷事业和正确运用货币贮蓄的工作，对于国民经济的发展是有着重大意义的。党为解决这个问题所采取的措施是朝着如下两方面进行的：把全部短期信贷事业集中于国家银行；在公营经济部分中实行划拨清算制。于是，第一，国家银行变成为统计产品生产和分配的全国性机关；第二，有大量的货币从流通范围中间空闲出来。毫无疑义，这些措施一定会（而且已在）促进全部信贷事业的整顿和我国金融的巩固。”〔注五〕
    苏联的信用制度在社会主义工业化中的作用大致如此。
    我国目前正在逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，毫无疑问，信用制度对于这一事业也具有重大的意义。
    我国的信用制度是以中国人民银行为主体的、统一集中化的信用制度。我国国家银行的性质和任务，也正如列宁所谈过的，是“实现社会主义所必需的一种机构”，“全国范围的产品生产与分配的统计机关”，“社会主义的一种骨干”。我国的私营银行，也已经按照国家的需要，用国家资本主义高级形式统一在公私合营银行中。我国农村中的信用合作组织，也日益成为强大的力量。现阶段的中国信用制度是由强有力的国家银行加上统一的公私合营银行和广泛的信用合作组织构成的。
    在为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化的过程中，我国信用制度必须采取各种有效的措施，来满足工业的需要（国家银行的信用首先满足工业需要的这一原则，是指整个社会主义工业化时期来说的。在事实上，在我国社会主义工业化开始时，由于经济建设和资金分配周转等若干具体因素，商业贷款的比重却是大于工业贷款的比重）。也必须以大量的资金帮助农业和手工业生产的发展，促进农业和手工业的社会主义改造的实现。除此以外，信用制度还必须促进对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，特别要从发展工业生产着眼来支持这一政策。在现阶段，对于公私合营的工业应根据不同的实际情况，分别地在贷款条件、利率及其他方面较比对私营工业应给予不同的便利和优待。对于向公私合营企业发展的私营工业，在贷款条件方面，较之私营工业可予以放宽。对于为国家加工订货的私营工业，在充分利用其自有资金的原则下，必要时也可贷款。国家银行在贯彻国家对私营工商业信用政策的时候，应该注意运用公私合营银行的力量。
    在社会主义工业化时期中，由于生产与流通规模不断增加，国民经济各部门，特别是工业部门对于国家银行信用的需要也随之增加，国家银行依靠什么资财来源来满足整个国民经济、尤其是工业方面这种不断增长的需要呢？
    发行货币固然是国家银行资财的重要来源之一，但货币发行的增加必须适应于流通界对于货币量增长的需要，这个来源是有限度的。因此，国家银行的主要的资财来源，不是发行货币，而是依靠吸入资金，即国家预算帐户浮存的资金，机关和团体往来帐户的资金，经济组织结算帐户和结算中的资金以及人民的储蓄等。上述吸入资金所起的作用是不同的：预算帐户的资金在社会主义工业化时期中是随着国家预算收入与支出规模的迅速增涨而不断增加的，因而它是国家银行较重要的、经常的资财来源。人民储蓄是随着劳动人民收入的增多而不断增加，它也可以成为国家银行的经常的资财来源，但是这些资财分散在众多的城乡居民手中，必须采取各种措施才能把它们动员起来。经济组织的资金也随着工业生产规模的扩大以及新建、改建企业的加多而有所增加，但在社会主义工业化时期中，尤其是在工业化初期，许多现有的工业主要是在原有的基础上，通过资金的合理运用来扩大生产的规模，因而它在存款增加的速度上却可能有停滞甚至降低的趋势。苏联在一九二六年到一九二九年，国家银行中工业方面存款的比重由百分之十六降至百分之十五这一事实，即可以证明这一情况。
    社会主义工业化的资金，不仅依靠上述“开源”的方法，而且还要用合理组织信用事业的方法来解决。
    合理地组织信用事业，就是要以合理分配资金来满足工业化过程中国民经济对于资金的需要，同时要通过信用关系来加强对企业经济活动的监督，以便促使企业合理地运用资金、促使企业加速资金周转、降低成本、增加积累。
    发挥国家银行对企业日常经济活动的监督作用，对于保证并加速社会主义工业化的实现说来，具有重大的意义。
    正如上面所说，为了充分发挥国家银行对企业的监督作用，必须改变国民经济中的信用关系，尤其是国营企业、合作社之间的信用关系。这就是说，要有计划、有步骤地取消社会主义经济中的商业信用而代之以国家银行的信用。一九五○年末政务院颁布的“货币管理实施办法”就是为了要取消国营经济、合作社经济中的商业信用，把一切短期信用集中到国家银行，以便保证信用制度在社会主义工业化的事业中发挥监督作用。
    发挥信用制度对经济组织日常活动的监督作用，重要的事情还在于加强国家银行和企业之间的直接信用联系。
    在国民经济恢复时期中，国家银行对于国营企业的贷款，约有百分之六十至百分之六十五是按照集中的程序贷放，即先把款项发放给各部、局或总公司，然后再由它们分配给所属的工矿企业和贸易组织，这种办法是很难加强国家银行和企业之间的直接联系，很难使国家银行充分发挥对企业的监督作用的。自从国营企业实行清产核资，开始转向经济核算制之后，这种情况已有改进，许多工厂、矿山已经和银行建立了直接的信用联系。一九五三年，国营商业部门也开始推行了经济核算制，国家银行也随着商业部门资金的下放，开始和各省公司以及许多基层机构建立了直接的信用关系。这一措施，无疑地是把国家银行对企业的监督工作向前推进了一步。
    国家银行对实行经济核算的企业直接信贷，是发挥银行对企业监督作用的必要步骤。但要充分有力地发挥这个作用，必须改进信贷方式。
    中国人民银行根据国民经济各部门组织上与经营上的特点，吸取苏联先进的经验，开始按照信用的目的，制定了一些适应国民经济发展要求的新的信贷方式。根据企业的具体情况，创造条件在国营企业中逐步推行科学化的信贷方式，逐步贯彻国家银行信用的计划性、目的性、归还性、期限性以及物质保证性的原则，充分发挥信用制度对国民经济生产和流通过程的日常监督作用，是今后国家银行的重要任务。
    综上所述，我们可以看出，信用制度在国家的社会主义工业化中的作用是很重要的。加强信用制度，就可以推动社会主义工业化向前迅速发展。因此，在社会主义工业化时期中，不但一切信用机构应该充分发挥其作用，就是各级党组织和政府各经济部门以及广大人民群众，都应该努力支持各种信用工作，使它能够很好地为社会主义工业化服务。
