People's Liberation Army Endorses Declaration to Liberate Taiwan
East China Coastal Defense Units Resolve to Achieve Meritorious Service in the Battle to Liberate Taiwan
[By Our Correspondent] Commanders and fighters of various military regions and units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army warmly support the joint declaration by various democratic parties and people's organizations to liberate Taiwan, and are determined to strengthen political and military training, master modern military technology, and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

Commanders and fighters of a certain unit stationed in Nanjing under the East China Military Region, taking advantage of rest time during field military training after reading the joint declaration, spontaneously organized discussion meetings. Everyone excitedly said: The more skills we learn, the more guarantee we have for liberating Taiwan. Shen Jinxiang, a student of a certain naval unit of the East China Military Region, said: "Our People's Navy bears a great responsibility for liberating Taiwan. I will definitely intensify my studies, improve my skills, and strive to make meritorious service for the people in performing the glorious task of liberating Taiwan." Wang Dawei, a soldier of a certain air force unit, said: "Our People's Air Force must make greater efforts to defend the airspace of the motherland and be ready to cooperate with the army and navy to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and liberate the suffering compatriots in Taiwan." Commanders and fighters of the army, navy, and air force units stationed on the front lines of the Zhejiang coastal defense expressed their extreme excitement and determination to respond to the great call of the various democratic parties and people's organizations to liberate Taiwan with active actions. A certain naval vessel had recently shot down three Chiang bandits' planes and damaged two Chiang bandits' ships in the waters off eastern Zhejiang. After the sailors on the vessel read the joint declaration, they all said: We must more actively strike at the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's army and fight for the final liberation of Taiwan. Air Force pilots Song Defeng and Li Maoren firmly stated: We are always ready to pilot the iron eagles given to us by the motherland, to annihilate more of Chiang Kai-shek's remaining troops, and to fight for the liberation of the Taiwan compatriots who are in dire straits. Soldiers Yang Yongmao, Guo Ziwen, and Zhou Zhaofang of a certain army unit also warmly supported the joint declaration. They said: The joint declaration is a solemn call from the people of the motherland to us. We must hold our weapons tightly and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and contribute all our strength to the liberation cause of the motherland.

Liu Xihong, a combat hero of a certain unit of the Central South Military Region, said: "Under the protection of the US air and naval forces, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is constantly harassing our southeast coast and engaging in piracy, looting our merchant ships and foreign merchant ships trading with our country, and disturbing the production and safety of the coastal people. We must eliminate this sinful traitorous clique." Sun Dianchen, deputy company commander of a certain unit who has been credited with seven major merits, said: "Under the instigation of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique sends special agents to the mainland to carry out assassination and sabotage activities. We have captured many such agents. We must resolutely liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and defend the socialist construction of the motherland."

Qu Xinjing, battalion commander of a certain unit of the public security forces of the Northeast Military Region, said: "We have the determination and the strength to liberate Taiwan. I will definitely lead my troops well under the command of my superiors, enhance revolutionary vigilance, and crush any sabotage activities by hidden enemies at any time." Zhou Xinming, a student of a certain military school, expressed his determination after seeing the joint declaration: "In the past liberation war, we fought against the enemy on the water. Now we are studying modern military science, we must study harder and quickly improve our military skills to participate in the great struggle to liberate Taiwan." Li Shuyuan, an anti-aircraft gunner of the air defense force, said: "Taiwan compatriots are still suffering under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. I must work with my comrades to better master the weapons in our hands and resolutely fight for the liberation of Taiwan."

The broad commanders and fighters of the Southwest Military Region warmly support the joint declaration on liberating Taiwan. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to make preparations in all aspects and stand by at any time to fight for the liberation of Taiwan and the defense of the motherland. The border defense unit of a certain regiment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed on the Yunnan border made contributions to the people in the war to liberate the mainland of the motherland. After entering the border area, they vigilantly guarded the border day and night and annihilated many bandits and special agents. The soldiers of this battalion unanimously expressed their support for the joint declaration. Zheng Fake, a second-class meritorious person, said: "We must hold our guns tightly, strengthen our vigilance, and fight for the liberation of Taiwan and the completion of the reunification of the motherland!" Wei Xiaotang, a combat hero of a certain unit who had just returned from a visit to the Soviet Union, said: "I saw the heroic Soviet army in the Soviet Union. Their high patriotic spirit and military qualities are a model for us to learn from. I must work hard to improve my military, political, and cultural level, master modern military technology, protect the southwestern border of the motherland, and fight for the liberation of Taiwan!" Combat hero Wang Ruhhan said after seeing the joint declaration: "We must step up military and political training, master the weapons in our hands, and actively respond to the call to liberate Taiwan."
