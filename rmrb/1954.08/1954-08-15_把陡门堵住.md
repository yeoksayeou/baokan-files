    Blocking the Sluice Gate
    At dawn on July 2nd, a torrential rain poured down on the Guanxu area of Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, and the floodwaters rose sharply. The water level of Chao Lake was level with the dikes. More than a hundred soldiers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Chaoxian County braved the rain and went to Guanxu to reinforce the dikes and carry out emergency repairs. As soon as they arrived at the dike, they immediately began to rescue the dangerous sections. After two hours of intense labor, the sub-dike of the dangerous section was built. Just then, a warning of danger came from not far to the east. The soldiers immediately assembled and rushed to the place where the danger occurred. It turned out that the sluice gate of the dike was in danger, and the floodwaters rushed into the enclosure, causing the dike to collapse more and more, and the hole to be eroded deeper and deeper. It seemed that a green field of seedlings was about to be submerged by the flood. At this critical moment, the soldiers arrived. The commander shouted to rush to the rescue. With a plop, a soldier named Wu Fujin jumped into the flood with a sack. Then eighteen more soldiers jumped in. Because the water was so strong, some soldiers were washed away, and some were knocked down by the water. Everyone standing on the dike was worried about them, but the soldiers fought bravely against the flood in the water, and finally swam to the sluice gate, doing their best to block the leak and ensuring the safety of more than 4,000 mu of rice in the entire enclosure.

    把陡门堵住
    七月二日拂晓，安徽巢县官圩一带暴雨倾泻，洪水大涨，巢湖湖水已和圩堤相平。住在巢县的人民解放军某部百余名战士，冒雨前往官圩抢险修堤去了。他们一到圩堤，立即开始抢救险段，经过两小时的紧张劳动，险段的子埂就筑好了。正在这时，东面不远的地方又响起了出险的警报，战士们马上集合，向出险的地方奔去。原来是圩堤的陡门出险了，洪水滚滚向圩内冲去，圩堤越崩越大，洞越冲越深，眼看一片绿油油的秧苗就要被洪水淹没了。就在这个紧张关头，战士们赶到了，指挥员喊了一声抢险，只听得噗通一声，一位叫吴富金的战士抱着麻袋跳进了洪水，接着又跳下去十八个战士，由于水势甚猛，有的战士被水冲着走，有的战士被水冲倒了，站在堤上的人都为他们捏一把汗，但战士们在水里英勇地和洪水搏斗着，终于游到陡门口，全力堵塞住漏洞，保障了全圩四千多亩稻子的安全。　（崇信）
