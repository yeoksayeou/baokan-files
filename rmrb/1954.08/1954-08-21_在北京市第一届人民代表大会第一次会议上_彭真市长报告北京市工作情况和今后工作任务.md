    At the First Session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress, Mayor of Beijing Peng Zhen delivered a report on the government's work over the past five years and future tasks.

    The report first pointed out: Over the past five years, under the direct leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Mao, with the direct leadership and assistance of relevant central and North China departments, and with the care and assistance of the people of the whole country and leading comrades from various regions, the entire people of Beijing, relying on the unity and efforts of all democratic parties, people's organizations, and people of all circles and nationalities, have carried out the restoration and construction of the capital in various aspects with a large scale and rapid speed, thoroughly smashed the reactionary ruling institutions and eliminated the Kuomintang's reactionary work style, carried out various social reform movements to eliminate the remaining forces and influences of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, carried out the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, carried out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements to eliminate the filth of the old society, carried out democratic reforms of factories and enterprises, carried out economic recovery and development work, and, on the basis of the people's self-education, carried out ideological remolding work, thus making Beijing take on a new look in terms of politics, economy, ideology, culture and education, urban construction, and social atmosphere, and the material and cultural life of the entire people has also been continuously improved.

    The report pointed out: Although the achievements of Beijing's various construction works over the past five years are significant, there are still many serious shortcomings in our work. The most important thing is that our ideological and political leadership is relatively weak, the overall planning in leadership is insufficient, the creativity is insufficient, and the level of professional leadership is not high, especially in terms of summarizing experience in a timely manner to make it systematic, so as to improve the work of cadres and the masses is not enough; therefore, the speed of improvement of the political and ideological level of cadres cannot keep up with the needs of the objective situation. At the same time, some cadres do not use the advanced level they should have to demand and spur themselves, but use backward standards to measure their work and the little achievements they have already made, and they are complacent and think that their work is "almost" done, proud and complacent, and do not seek progress. This makes many jobs not advance by leaps and bounds. Only by continuously carrying out criticism and self-criticism, checking, exposing, and relentlessly criticizing the shortcomings and errors in our work, and correcting them in a timely manner, can we strengthen unity, enhance morale, boost morale, and complete our glorious tasks in accordance with the country's general task in the transition period and the country's current plan.

    The report pointed out the current tasks, saying that in order to realize the country's general task in the transition period, in terms of political struggle: First, we must fight to the end to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan. Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory. It is occupied by the United States and entrenched by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and has not yet been liberated. We must mobilize, like we supported the War of Liberation and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in the past, and unite with the people of the whole country to strengthen all aspects of our work, and support the Chinese People's Liberation Army by working hard in production, working hard, studying hard, completing the national construction plan, increasing national wealth, and strengthening national defense, to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and liberate our territory, Taiwan. Second, we must heighten our vigilance, continue to eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionary elements, and strictly guard against the sabotage activities of enemy agents and spies. Any right-leaning thinking that is paralyzed and underestimated is dangerous and beneficial to the enemy and detrimental to us. Third, we have already cleared and severely cracked down on many of the old society's filth, such as prostitution, corruption, and theft. However, these filth left over from history for a long time cannot be completely eliminated in a short period of time or after one or two movements. At the same time, some of the old society's filth, such as thieves, swindlers, and other hooligans, we have not had time to systematically deal with one by one in the past. We must wage a long-term and unremitting struggle against them. Fourth, the general task of our country in the transition period is to realize the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. We must transform capitalist industry and commerce, and we must also transform agriculture and handicrafts. Now, peasants and handicraftsmen have voluntarily organized themselves on a large scale and consciously carried out socialist self-transformation. Many capitalists have already seen the historical trend and the relationship of interests and are willing to accept socialist transformation in accordance with the laws of social development and strive to make contributions in socialist construction and socialist transformation. However, there are still a small number of capitalists who are short-sighted and selfish and are unwilling to implement or even resist socialist transformation. For these people, we must first patiently conduct full education, open up their thinking, and make them move forward along the track prescribed by the general task, but we cannot but carry out a serious struggle against those who stubbornly sabotage socialist transformation and those who seriously violate the law by repeating the "five poisons." Fifth, we must also carry out ideological remolding. In accordance with the general task and the needs of socialist construction and socialist transformation, we must unite the will of the entire people under the leadership of the working class in order to make our unity increasingly consolidated and strengthened. Individualism that disregards the whole, disregards the country, and the people, the exploitative class's view of despising labor and despising the working people, unorganized and undisciplined laxity, and ideological laziness are all unfavorable to our great socialist cause, and we should constantly overcome them by means of mass self-education. Only in this way can we ensure that we continue to progress without falling behind. Sixth, with the beginning of the period of large-scale and planned construction in our country, with the convening of the National People's Congress and the promulgation of the Constitution, our people's democratic system will gradually become more sound and complete. All state workers and the entire people must establish the habit of strictly abiding by the law and doing things in accordance with the law. Our capital's staff and citizens should not only become labor models and work models, but also become law-abiding models.

    In terms of economic construction, the report pointed out: Beijing is gradually changing from a consumer city to a production city. Our capital is not only the political center and cultural center, but also should be and must be the economic center and a modern industrial city. In recent years, Beijing's industrial production has greatly developed. The total value of industrial production in 1953 was 6.76 times that of 1949 and 10.8 times that of 1948. At the same time, Beijing's socialist construction and socialist transformation have also developed. However, because Beijing's original industrial base was very weak, although the development speed is very fast, the current industrial production is still very backward. The two key points in the current state-owned industrial production are to plan and build new factories and to continue to explore the potential of existing factories. On the one hand, it must be recognized that the construction of new and expanded modern factories and mines is an important key to establishing a strong industrial base in our country and realizing the country's socialist industrialization. At the same time, without the establishment of a considerable number of modern large-scale new factories, it is impossible to turn Beijing into a new industrial city. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize all forces, do everything possible, and guarantee and support the construction of new factories and mines in Beijing in the first five-year plan from all aspects, and provide strong support for the new and expanded factories throughout the country. On the other hand, we must fully recognize that constantly improving production and exploring potential is the fundamental task of existing factories and mines, and is the regular central work of our industrial leadership. In recent years, none of the large new factories built in Beijing have been put into production, and the number of workers in the original factories and mines has only increased by 1.94 times, but the total value of production has increased by nearly six times. The increase in the total value of production is mainly due to the efforts of cadres and workers, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improving management, improving technology, and exploring potential. The potential of our existing factories and mines is still very large, and we must continue to explore it. Beijing's industry must constantly increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs, and strive to produce high-quality and low-priced products. The central state-owned factories and mines must strictly implement the orders and instructions of the central competent departments, ensure the completion and strive to over fulfill the state plan. Local state-owned industry and private industry must earnestly improve management, improve technology, overcome the phenomenon of poor product quality, and strive to reduce the rate of defective products and substandard products to the minimum. At the same time, in accordance with the needs of the country and the people, in accordance with the equipment, raw materials, and market conditions, we must take the overall situation into consideration and further organize or reorganize local state-owned industry and private industry, starting with the rectification of local state-owned industry, and through various forms such as joint state-private operation, processing and ordering, and acquisition and sales, gradually get capitalist industry out of the blindness of production and change the backward situation, and gradually make all factories, according to their strengths, divide their labor and cooperate, and form an organic whole. We must continue to rectify the construction industry, explore potential, overcome waste, and strive to complete and over fulfill the task of increasing labor productivity by 30% and reducing project costs by 10% this year, and earnestly guarantee the quality of the project.

    The report then talked about commercial work. The report said: In recent years, the volume of commodity circulation has increased greatly: In 1953, the total sales volume of public and private goods increased by 4.33 times compared with 1949. Among them, the sales volume of state-owned, cooperative-operated, and joint state-private operated commercial goods increased by 8.69 times; private commercial goods increased by 2.29 times. The proportion of state-owned, cooperative-operated, and joint state-private operated commercial goods in the total sales volume has increased from 32% to 58%. This is the result of the restoration and development of production, the increase in social purchasing power, and the expansion of material exchanges between urban and rural areas. It is precisely because of the development of production, the increase in the number of employed people, and the increase in people's living standards that the growth rate of social purchasing power has exceeded the growth rate of the production of means of livelihood, so there has been a situation in the market where many commodities are in short supply. To solve this contradiction in supply and demand, the fundamental method is to actively and systematically increase production, but at the same time, we must take appropriate measures from the acquisition and supply and marketing of commerce to overcome the speculative and blind nature of capitalist industry and commerce, so as to ensure the stability of the market and guarantee the smooth progress of socialist construction.

    Regarding the socialist transformation of handicrafts, the report pointed out: The development of handicraft cooperation must be carried out in accordance with the principle of "active leadership and steady progress," and in accordance with market and raw material conditions, first, a large number of supply and marketing production cooperatives and supply and marketing production groups that handicraftsmen are willing to accept should be developed, and handicraft production cooperatives should be gradually developed.

    The report said that after the land reform, agricultural production in the suburbs has been rapidly improved. For example, compared with 1953 and 1950, the total value of agricultural production increased by 1.21 times, of which vegetable production increased by four times. Up to now, the number of farmers participating in cooperatives and mutual aid groups has reached 57% of the total number of farmers, but it still needs to be actively further developed, and more importantly, it is necessary to obtain experience in cooperation and gradual mechanization from here, and ensure the supply of urban non-staple foods, mainly vegetables.

    Regarding education work, the report pointed out: Old Beijing was known as a "cultural city," but the working people did not enjoy the right to cultural education. After liberation, the People's Government not only developed education rapidly, but also changed the situation where the working people could not receive education. However, there are also many shortcomings, mainly that the quality of education in many primary and secondary schools is still very poor, and attention has not been paid to improving quality while developing quantity. The education administrative department is taking active measures with emphasis to improve it. At present, teaching guidance materials have been compiled, and the admission standards for new students have been reasonably raised, which is a good start. However, at present, we should also focus on the in-service training of teachers, and after the start of school, we must do a good job in formulating a plan to improve the quality of education. The capital is the base for the country to train cadres and specialized talents, and it is the focus of scientific research. The construction and development of institutions of higher learning and scientific research institutions in the capital are of great importance to our country's economic and cultural construction, and we must do our best to ensure its smooth completion.

    The report said that since liberation, the health cause has greatly developed. Due to the improvement of the material and cultural life of the working people, the mortality rate of the urban population has greatly decreased. In the future, we should vigorously strengthen the health and medical work of factories and mines, especially heavy industry, new factories and mines, and construction sites; and gradually make the patriotic health movement regular. At present, we must quickly take effective measures to improve the work of traditional Chinese medicine.

    In terms of urban construction work, the report said that we have implemented the policy of serving production, serving the working people, and serving the central government agencies, fundamentally changing the situation in the reactionary ruling period where municipal engineering and public facilities only served a few ruling classes, and carried out large-scale and rapid construction of houses and strengthened municipal engineering and public facilities. By the end of 1953, more than 6.7 million square meters of various houses had been newly built, which is about one-third of the original houses in Beijing before liberation. Great achievements have also been made in the renovation and construction of roads and sewers. However, in the past, in order to demolish fewer houses in the city, and at the same time, there was a lack of overall urban construction planning and unified construction plans, which led to the situation where new houses were very scattered, which was not only very uneconomical, but also added some difficulties to the city's reconstruction and expansion in the future. In the future, we must determine the overall plan as soon as possible, gradually achieve unified planning, unified design, and build the city as a unified whole in a planned way in accordance with the principles of socialist urban construction, and as far as possible, adhere to the policy of developing from the inside to the outside, from the near to the far, and developing in a concentrated and large area, and focus on rebuilding the urban area and gradually changing the appearance of the capital's main traffic arteries.

    The report finally pointed out: Beijing is the capital of the great People's Republic of China. The scale of various construction projects is very large. In fact, many major tasks are progressing simultaneously, and the speed is very fast. An important guarantee for us to do our work well is the unity of the people of the whole city, the unity of all democratic classes led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. In the past, we relied on our unity to achieve the results of various tasks. In the future, we must further strengthen our unity and achieve greater victories. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在北京市第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上
    彭真市长报告北京市工作情况和今后工作任务
    在北京市第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上，北京市人民政府市长彭真作了五年来政府工作情况和今后工作任务的报告。
    报告首先指出：北京市全体人民过去五年多在中央和毛主席的直接领导下，在中央和华北有关部门的直接领导和帮助下，在全国人民和各地领导同志的关怀帮助下，依靠各民主党派、各人民团体和各界各族人民的团结努力，用很大的规模和很快的速度进行了首都各方面的恢复和建设工作，彻底粉碎了反动统治机构并清除了国民党的反动作风，进行了肃清帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的残余势力和残余影响的各项社会改革运动，进行了伟大的抗美援朝运动，进行了肃清旧社会污毒的“三反”、“五反”运动，进行了工厂企业的民主改革，进行了经济恢复和发展工作，并在人民群众自我教育的基础上，进行了思想改造工作，从而使北京在政治、经济、思想、文化教育、市政建设和社会风气等各方面面貌一新，全体人民物质和文化生活，也不断地获得改善。
    报告指出：五年来，北京各项建设工作的成绩虽然是很大的，但是在工作中还存在着许多严重的缺点。最主要的是我们的思想、政治领导比较薄弱，领导上统筹全面的计划性不够，创造性不够，业务领导水平不高，特别是对及时地把经验加以总结使之条理化，以提高干部和群众的工作做得不够；因而干部的政治思想水平提高的速度跟不上客观形势的需要。同时有些干部不是用应有的先进的水平来要求和鞭策自己，而是用落后标准来衡量自己的工作和已有的一点成绩，有点成绩就沾沾自喜，以为自己的工作已经“差不多”了，骄傲自满，不求进步。这就使得许多工作不是大踏步前进。我们只有不断地开展批评与自我批评，检查、揭发和无情地批评工作中的缺点、错误，及时改正，才能加强团结，提高斗志，振作士气，按照国家在过渡时期的总任务和国家当前的计划，完成我们的光荣任务。
    报告指出当前的任务说，为了实现国家在过渡时期的总任务，在政治斗争方面：第一，要为完成解放台湾的光荣任务奋斗到底。台湾是中国神圣不可侵犯的领土，它被美国侵占，被蒋介石卖国集团盘踞，尚未解放。我们要和过去支援解放战争、支援抗美援朝战争那样，动员起来，同全国人民一道，加强各方面的工作，用努力生产，努力工作，努力学习，完成国家建设计划，增加国家财富，加强国防力量，来支援中国人民解放军，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，解放我国的领土台湾。第二，要提高警惕，继续肃清残余的反革命分子，严防敌人特务间谍的破坏活动。任何麻痹轻敌的右倾思想，都是危险的，都是有利于敌人而不利于我们的。第三，我们已经大量清除了和严重打击了旧社会遗留下来的很多污毒，如妓院、贪污、盗窃现象等。但是这些历史上长期遗留下来的污毒，绝不是在短期内或者经过一两次运动就可以彻底肃清的。同时，有些旧社会的污毒，例如小偷、骗子和其他流氓分子等，我们过去也还没有来得及一一作系统的处理。对他们必须作长期不懈的斗争。第四，我们国家在过渡时期的总任务，是实现国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造。要改造资本主义工商业，也要改造农业、手工业。现在农民、手工业者已经在广大范围内自愿地纷纷组织起来，自觉地实行社会主义的自我改造。有很多资本家已经看清了历史趋势和利害关系，愿意按照社会发展规律，接受社会主义改造，努力在社会主义建设和社会主义改造中立功。但也还有一小部分资本家，目光短小，自私成性，不愿意实行、甚至抵抗社会主义改造。我们对于这些人首先必须耐心地进行充分的教育，打通他们的思想，使他们沿着总任务所规定的轨道前进，但是对于那些顽固地破坏社会主义改造的分子，对于重施“五毒”的严重违法分子，就不能不进行严肃的斗争。第五，我们还必须进行思想改造，按照总任务，按照社会主义建设和社会主义改造的需要，在工人阶级的领导下，把全体人民的意志统一起来才能使我们的团结日益巩固和加强。不顾整体、不顾国家、人民的个人主义，轻视劳动、轻视劳动人民的剥削阶级的观点，无组织无纪律的散漫性和思想上的懒汉，都是不利于我们伟大的社会主义事业的，我们应该不断地用群众自我教育的方法把它克服。只有这样，才能保证我们不断地进步而不至落后掉队。第六，随着国家大规模的、有计划的建设时期的开始，随着全国人民代表大会会议的召开和宪法的公布，我们的人民民主制度将逐步更加健全和完备。所有国家工作人员、全体人民，必须树立严格遵守法律和按照法律办事的习惯。我们首都的工作人员和市民不但应该成为劳动的模范、工作的模范，并且应该成为守法的模范。
    在经济建设方面，报告指出：北京正在从消费城市向生产城市逐步转变。我们的首都不仅是政治中心、文化中心，同时应该是也必须是经济中心和现代化的工业城市。几年来，北京的工业生产有了很大的发展，一九五三年的工业生产总值为一九四九年的六点七六倍，为一九四八年的十点八倍。同时，北京的社会主义建设与社会主义改造事业也有了发展。但由于北京原来的工业基础很弱，虽然发展速度很快，目前工业生产仍然还很落后。当前国营工业生产方面的两个关键是有计划地建设新厂和再接再厉地不断发掘现有工厂的潜在力量。一方面要认识到新建和扩建现代化的工厂矿山是建立我国强大的工业基础、实现国家的社会主义工业化的重要关键，同时，没有相当数量的现代化的大规模的新工厂的建立，是不可能把北京变为新的工业城市的。因此必须动员一切力量，尽一切可能并从一切方面，保障和支援第一个五年计划中在北京的新建厂矿的建设，并对全国的新建扩建的工厂进行有力的支援。另一方面，必须充分认识到不断地改进生产，发掘潜力，是现有厂矿企业的根本任务，是我们领导工业的经常的中心工作。几年来，北京新建的大工厂，一个还没有投入生产，原有厂矿中的工人只增加了一点九四倍，但生产总值却增加了近六倍。生产总值的增加主要是靠干部和工人努力、学习苏联先进经验、改进管理、改进技术、发掘潜力获得的。我们现有厂矿的潜力还很大，必须再接再厉地不断发掘。北京的工业要不断增加产量、提高质量、降低成本，为生产物美价廉的产品而奋斗。中央国营厂矿必须严格执行中央主管部门的命令和指示，保证完成并争取超额完成国家计划。地方国营工业和私营工业必须切实改善管理，改进技术，克服产品质量低劣的现象，力求把废品、次品率减少到最少限度。同时，要按照国家和人民的需要，按照设备、原料、市场情况，统筹全局，把地方国营工业和私营工业进一步加以组织或改组，首先从整顿地方国营工业入手，并通过公私合营、加工订货及收购包销等各种形式，使资本主义工业逐步摆脱生产的盲目性和改变落后的状况，逐步把所有工厂各按所长，分工协作，组成一个有机的整体。要继续整顿建筑业，发掘潜力，克服浪费，努力完成并超额完成本年提高劳动生产率百分之三十、减低工程造价百分之十，并切实保证工程质量的任务。
    报告接着讲到商业工作，报告说：几年来商品流转额有很大的上升：一九五三年，公私销货总额较一九四九年增加了四点三三倍。其中，国营、合作社营、公私合营商业销货额增加了八点六九倍；私营商业增加了二点二九倍。而国营、合作社营、公私合营商业在总销货额中的比重，已由百分之三十二上升到百分之五十八。这是生产的恢复与发展、社会购买力的提高及城乡内外物资交流扩大的结果。正是由于生产发展，就业人数增加，人民生活水平提高，社会购买力增长速度超过了生活资料生产增长的速度，所以市场上出现了许多商品供不应求的情况。要解决供求方面存在的这种矛盾，根本的方法是要积极地、有计划地增加生产，但同时又必须从商业的收购与供销方面采取适当的措施，克服资本主义工商业的投机性和盲目性，以保证市场的稳定，保障社会主义建设的顺利进行。
    关于手工业的社会主义改造工作，报告指出：手工业合作化的发展必须按照“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针，按照市场和原料的情况，首先大量发展手工业者乐于接受的供销生产合作社和供销生产小组，并且逐步地发展手工业生产合作社。
    报告说，土地改革后郊区农业生产得到了迅速的提高。如以一九五三年和一九五○年相比，农业生产总值增加了一点二一倍，其中蔬菜产量增加了四倍。到现在为止，参加合作社和互助组的农户已达农户总数的百分之五十七，但还需要积极地进一步加以发展，更重要的是要从这里取得合作化和逐步机械化的经验，并保障城市副食品主要是蔬菜的供给。
    在教育工作方面，报告指出：旧北京号称“文化城”，但劳动人民并没有享受文化教育的权利。解放以后，人民政府不但以很快的速度发展了教育事业，而且改变了劳动人民受不到教育的情况。但也有很多的缺点，主要是很多中小学校的教育质量仍然很差，没有在发展数量的同时注意提高质量。教育行政部门正在有重点地采取积极措施，加以改进。目前，已编辑了教学指导材料，合理地提高了新生录取标准，这是一个良好的开始。但是目前还应抓紧教师的进修工作，开学后必须做好制定提高教育质量计划的工作。首都是国家培养干部和专门人材的基地，是科学研究的重心。首都高等学校、科学研究机关的建设和发展，对我国经济、文化建设关系很大，我们必须全力保证它的顺利完成。
    报告说，解放以来卫生事业有很大的发展，由于劳动人民的物质文化生活的改善，城区人口死亡率已大大下降。今后应大力加强厂矿企业、特别是重工业、新建厂矿和建筑工地的卫生医疗工作；逐步使爱国卫生运动做到经常化。当前要迅速采取有效措施，改进对中医的工作。
    在城市建设工作方面，报告说，我们执行了为生产服务、为劳动人民服务、为中央各机关服务的方针，根本改变了过去反动统治时期市政工程和公用设施只为少数统治阶级服务的状况，并大规模地、迅速地进行了房屋建筑，加强市政工程和公用设施，到一九五三年底已新建各种房屋六百七十多万平方公尺，约相当于解放前北京原有房屋的三分之一。道路、下水道的整修和新建，也都取得了很大的成绩。可是，过去为了在城内少拆房屋，同时又缺乏城市建设的总体规划和统一的建筑计划，以致造成了新建房屋十分分散的局面，不但很不经济，而且给今后城市改建和扩建增加了若干困难。今后必须及早确定总体规划，逐步做到统一规划，统一设计，按照社会主义的城市建设原则，把城市当做统一的整体，有计划地进行建设，尽可能坚持由内向外、由近到远、集中地、成区成片地发展的方针，并要重点地改建城区，逐步改变首都最主要交通干线的面貌。
    报告最后指出：北京是伟大的中华人民共和国的首都，各项建设规模很大，事实上有好多重大工作是在齐头并进，并且速度很快。我们做好工作的一个重要保证，就是全市人民的团结，就是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的各民主阶级的团结。过去依靠了我们的团结，取得了各项工作的成绩，今后还要更加加强我们的团结，取得更大的胜利。（新华社）
