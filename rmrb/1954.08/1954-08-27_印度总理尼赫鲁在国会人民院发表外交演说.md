Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 26th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a foreign policy speech to the Lok Sabha on August 25th.

    In his speech, Nehru spoke about the Geneva Conference, saying that both conferences held in Geneva were related to Asian countries and peoples. To solve the important problems of the world today, it is necessary to recognize Asia's position in the modern world. Nehru said: "This was very evident in Geneva in several respects. First, China participated in both conferences, and its participation declared that not only is the recognition of facts unavoidable, but that such recognition has profound significance. Second, there is the fact that in the discussions on the Indochina issue, the discussions of the Prime Ministers of Southeast Asian countries in Colombo had an important and unavoidable effect on the Geneva Conference, even though none of these countries participated in the Geneva Conference."
    Nehru called for continued efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. He said: "The Korean conference ended without results, but it should be pointed out and affirmed that the conference did not terminate. For the sake of the stability and peace of Asia and the world, the Korean issue must be resolved." Nehru also stated:
  "The Geneva Conference should not be allowed to become a thing of the past. Efforts to advance towards peace in Korea should continue."
    Nehru said that the conference on the Indochina issue was of greater importance, a "historically unforgettable event," which replaced or prevented a situation that could have led to a major war. Nehru, referring to the role played by the representatives of the countries participating in the conference, said that the two chairmen of the conference, Eden and Molotov, played a mediating role. He continued:
  "In addition to the two chairmen of the conference, the Chinese Premier—whom we had the honor of welcoming in this country—showed himself to be a statesman with a constructive spirit. He also brought to the conference a direct sense of the reality of the new Asia." Nehru said that French Prime Minister Mendès-France and the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam showed courage and insight in dealing with this difficult issue. He believed that Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam also contributed to seeking a solution.
    Nehru said that the solution to the Indochina issue was a solution truly achieved through consultation, and that peace was the victor. He said: "The striking feature of the solution to the Indochina issue is that it stipulates ensuring the independence of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and striving to safeguard their sovereignty on the basis of guaranteeing mutual respect for territorial integrity, non-interference in internal affairs, and non-establishment of military alliances with other countries. Therefore, the Indochina countries have a good chance of placing themselves in collective peace without participating in war blocs." Nehru said: "Due to the solution of the Indochina issue, Asia has greater hope for achieving peace and stability."
    Nehru, referring to India's chairmanship of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Indochina, said: "We must shoulder this heavy responsibility." He added: "We are fortunate to have such colleagues as we have now, and to have such relations with all parties in Indochina as we have now. So far, all decisions in the committee have been unanimous. This in itself demonstrates the sincerity and genuine desire to work together."
    In his speech, Nehru spoke about Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India. Nehru said: "The welcome he received came from the heart, and this welcome showed our people's urgent desire for understanding and peaceful relations. It also showed the Asian friendship between our two peoples. This visit has given the two countries a greater understanding of each other."
    "The joint communique issued by Zhou Enlai and myself in our capacities as Prime Ministers of our respective countries has attracted worldwide attention. The five principles put forward in the communique arose from the method of collective peace. Our close neighbor Burma has also accepted these five principles, and other Southeast Asian countries have also endorsed these five principles. The understanding we have established is not directed against any one country or any group of countries. We hope that this understanding contains the core of a collective peace situation, which is the only way to replace war preparations and the only solid path to true security."
    Nehru also spoke about the upcoming Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting in the Philippines, saying: "We have indicated that we cannot participate in this meeting because, in our view, it is likely to reverse the trend towards reconciliation facilitated by the solution of the Indochina issue. We believe that collective security can only come about through resolving world tensions and developing a situation of collective peace. Any action that exacerbates these tensions takes us further away from peace."
    "The view and hope of the Indian government is that the current easing of world tensions that has come with the solution of the Indochina issue, as well as the desire for peace expressed by various countries, should be further promoted and used to promote world peace and solutions and prospects for resolving current world tensions. The United Nations General Assembly, which is scheduled to meet next month, has this historic task before it."
    Nehru also spoke about the movement for the incorporation of Goa into India. He said: This is entirely a mass movement of the Goan people themselves. But the Portuguese authorities are dealing with it in the long-standing but discredited colonial method of repression and totalitarian violence, while denying the people the inherent right to enjoy freedom and self-determination. Nehru expressed that the Indian government and people fully sympathize with the Goan people's desire to break free from foreign colonial rule and reunite with their motherland. However, the Indian government has no intention of considering and taking military action because of Portugal's provocation in assembling military forces.

    印度总理尼赫鲁在国会人民院发表外交演说
    【新华社新德里二十六日电】印度总理尼赫鲁八月二十五日在国会人民院发表外交演说。
    尼赫鲁在演说中谈到日内瓦会议时说，在日内瓦举行的两个会议都是同亚洲的国家和人民有关系的。要解决今天世界的重要问题，就必须承认亚洲在现代世界中的地位。尼赫鲁说：“这一点在日内瓦从几方面看来是很明显的。第一，中国参加了两个会议，并以它的参加宣布：不但承认事实是不可避免的，而且这种承认具有深长的意义也是不可避免的。第二，有这样的事实：在讨论印度支那问题的会议上，东南亚国家总理在科伦坡的讨论对于日内瓦会议产生了重要的和不可避免的作用，虽然这些国家中一个也没有参加日内瓦会议。”
    尼赫鲁要求继续努力和平解决朝鲜问题。他说：“朝鲜会议无结果而散，但是应该指出并肯定一点：会议并没有终结。为了亚洲和世界的稳定及和平的利益，必须解决朝鲜问题。”尼赫鲁还表示：
  “不应该容许日内瓦会议成为过去。向朝鲜和平前进的努力应该继续下去。”
    尼赫鲁说，关于印度支那问题的会议具有更大的重要意义，它是“历史上难忘的事件”，它代替或者防止了有导致大战之虞的局面。尼赫鲁在谈到参加会议的各国代表所起的作用时说，会议的两位主席艾登和莫洛托夫起了调停的作用。他接着说：
  “除了两位会议主席以外，中国总理——我们荣幸地在这个国家欢迎过他——表现出是一个具有建设精神的政治家。他也给会议直接带去了新亚洲的现实感。”尼赫鲁说，法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯和越南民主共和国代表在处理这个困难问题的时候表现有勇气，有见识。他认为，柬埔寨、老挝和越南国对于求得解决也是有所贡献的。
    尼赫鲁说，印度支那问题的解决是真正通过协商求得的解决，得到胜利的是和平。他说：“印度支那问题解决的显著特点是，它规定确保越南、老挝、柬埔寨三国的独立，并力求在保证互相尊重领土完整、互不干涉内政和不与其他国家成立军事同盟的基础上保障它们的主权。因此，印度支那国家很有希望置身于集体和平中而不参加战争集团。”尼赫鲁说：“由于印度支那问题的解决，亚洲已有更大的希望来求得和平和稳定。”
    尼赫鲁谈到印度在印度支那国际监督和监察委员会中担任主席一事时说：“我们必须负起这个繁重的责任。”他又说：“我们很幸运地有现在这样的同僚，并和印度支那各当事方面有现在这样的关系。到目前为止，委员会中的一切决定都是全体一致的。这件事本身就表现了努力合作的诚意和真挚的愿望。”
    尼赫鲁在演说中谈到周恩来总理对印度的访问。尼赫鲁说：“他所受到的欢迎是从内心发出来的，这种欢迎表明我国人民迫切希望谅解和和平关系。它还表现了我们两国人民之间的亚洲人情谊。这次访问已使两国彼此有了更大的了解。”
    “周恩来和我自己以我们自己国家的总理的身分发表的联合公报，已引起全世界的注意。公报中所提出的五项原则是从集体和平的办法中产生的。我们最近的邻国缅甸也接受了这五项原则，东南亚其他国家也赞成这五项原则。我们所确立的谅解不是针对某个国家或某一批国家的。我们希望这种谅解包含有集体和平局面的核心，这种集体和平是代替战争准备的唯一办法，是走向真正安全的唯一坚实途径。”
    尼赫鲁在演说中也谈到即将在菲律宾召开的东南亚公约组织会议，他说：“我们已经表示我们不能参加这次会议，因为，据我们看，它很可能把印度支那问题的解决所促成的和解的趋势倒转过来。我们认为，集体安全只有靠解决世界紧张局势和发展集体和平的局面才能到来。加剧这些紧张局势的任何做法都使我们远离和平。”
    “印度政府的看法和希望是：目前随着印度支那问题解决而来的世界紧张局势的缓和以及各国表示的要求和平的愿望，应该再接再厉地予以推进，并被利用来促进世界和平和解决目前世界紧张局势的办法和前景。定于下月开会的联合国大会面前放着这一具有历史意义的任务。”
    尼赫鲁还谈到果阿归并印度的运动。他说：这完全是果阿人自己的一个群众性运动。但葡萄牙当局却以那种由来已久的、但信誉扫地的殖民的方法、镇压和极权主义的暴力行为对付它，同时并否认人民有享受自由和自决权的固有权利。尼赫鲁表示，印度政府和人民完全同情果阿人民的摆脱外国殖民统治而和祖国重新结合的愿望。但是印度政府并无意因为葡萄牙正在结集军事力量的挑衅而考虑并采取军事行动。
