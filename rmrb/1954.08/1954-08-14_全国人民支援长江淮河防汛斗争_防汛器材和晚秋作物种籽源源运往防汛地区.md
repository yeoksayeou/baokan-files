The persistent and unremitting struggle against flooding along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers has received the wholehearted support of people from all over the country. Since late June, large quantities of flood control materials and late autumn crop seeds have been continuously transported from various regions to the flood-affected areas to help the people there overcome the floods and restore production as soon as possible.

Centered on Beijing, extending south to Guangdong, north to Heilongjiang, east to Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shandong, and west to Gansu and Sichuan, people in such a vast area, under the leadership of local Party committees and governments, have been continuously transporting flood control materials such as water pumps, air compressors,麻袋,草袋, timber, reed mats, lanterns, bricks, and stones to Wuhan, the Jingjiang Dam, Huangshi, Nanjing, Bengbu, and along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. From June to the evening of August 11, Beijing had transported more than 730,000麻袋and more than 299,000 reed mats to Wuhan. Staff members of state-owned commercial, cooperative, and transportation departments in the capital worked day and night, regardless of the weather, to quickly load and transport materials. Dockworkers waited in the rain at the station to unload麻袋 and transport reed mats, guaranteeing immediate unloading upon arrival. Truck drivers transported麻袋 and reed mats to the railway station in a timely manner, even when roads were muddy and difficult to navigate after rain. The Tianjin Railway Transportation Bureau transported a total of 283 carloads of草袋,麻袋, reed mats, water pumps, air compressors, and cables to Wuhan, Bengbu, Pukou, Zhenjiang, and other places in July. On the evening of August 5, the Tianjin Railway Transportation Bureau received a notification to transport 260,000麻袋to Wuhan. Workers carried麻袋 across planks to load them onto the train in the dark night, ensuring that this batch of materials departed on time. Workers at 340 blacksmith shops and welding shops in Shanghai rushed to produce 1,500 large iron anchors weighing 50 kilograms and 100 kilograms each in three days and sent them to Wuhan to hold the wooden rafts protecting the Yangtze River embankment. The first batch of 143 water pumps with electric motors produced by the Shenyang Water Pump Factory has been shipped from Shenyang to Wuhan. The second batch of 141 water pumps to support flood control and drainage in some areas along the Huai River has also been delivered to Xuzhou ahead of schedule. The third batch of 127 water pumps is currently being produced at the Shenyang Water Pump Factory and will soon be transported to Anhui Province for flood control and drainage, along with diesel engines with more than 3,000 horsepower. The first batch of water pumps rushed out by the state-owned Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory had been shipped to the flooded areas for drainage on July 26, and the second batch will be shipped soon. The workers also made extra parts that are easily damaged for these water pumps so that they can be replaced at any time. At present, the Wuhan has received hundreds of water pumps, and hundreds of thousands of麻袋,草袋. On the Huai River flood control front, a total of 3,410,000麻袋,草袋,蒲包, and reed mats, 120,000 pieces of timber, more than 23,000 kilograms of lead wire, more than 56,000 kilograms of hemp, more than 50 ships, 140 water pumps, and more than 100 tons of other equipment and materials have been received from various regions. Many regions also attached letters of sympathy to the materials being transported. One letter read: "Flood control is a battle, and materials are like ammunition. Whatever you need, we will support you."

In order to help the people in the disaster areas drain water and replant crops to quickly restore production, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Sichuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Hebei, and other provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have transported large quantities of seeds to the Yangtze and Huai River basins. Before August 10, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government had transferred 3,720,000 catties of late autumn crop seeds such as buckwheat and potatoes in two batches. The third batch of 5,000,000 catties of millet and glutinous millet seeds being transferred will also be completely transported to Anhui Province on the 18th. To ensure that farmers in the disaster areas could replant without delay, members of the Nanjia Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in 崞县 voluntarily formed three grain transportation teams, wading through the rain and water, and carried more than 2,750 catties of buckwheat, millet, and glutinous millet seeds to the nearby Yuanping Railway Station within two days. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is supporting disaster areas in Anhui, Hubei, and other provinces with 6,100,000 catties of seeds such as buckwheat and glutinous millet to plant late autumn crops. As of the 10th, more than 2,200,000 catties of buckwheat had been transported to Bengbu. In the Yan'an area of Shaanxi Province, farmers dispatched 1,500 donkeys to transport 500,000 catties of buckwheat seeds from Wuqi, Ansai, and other three counties to Yan'an within ten days, so that they could be quickly transferred to railway lines by trucks. Gansu Province has decided to support Anhui Province with 1,100,000 catties of potato seeds and is currently actively purchasing them. At present, Anhui Province has received more than 96,000,000 catties of late autumn crop seeds such as potatoes, corn, buckwheat, carrots, and rapeseed transported from various regions.

The flood control areas have also received medicines, grains, and vegetables supported by various regions. Nearly 100 tons of medical supplies needed for flood control in Wuhan and other places supported by Shanghai were shipped out on the 12th, and all medicines and equipment were packed into more than 2,700 boxes. The health departments of the Southwest and Northwest regions have decided to send doctors and inspectors to Wuhan, Bengbu, and other places to assist the local area in carrying out health and medical work. Guangdong Province had a bumper harvest of early rice this year. In the second half of July, in addition to the original planned grain transfer, an additional 10,000,000 catties of rice were transferred to Wuhan, Yueyang, and other places to supply the local people; in August, another 50,000,000 catties of rice were collected to support these flood control areas, which are currently being shipped in batches and will be completely shipped out before August 25. From July 20, Taiyuan, Yuci, Shouyang, and other places in Shanxi Province transported 50,000 to 60,000 catties of fresh vegetables such as cabbage and tomatoes every day. Shanghai, Guangzhou, Sichuan, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the Northeast have all done everything possible to transport large quantities of melons, eggplants, cabbage, dried vegetables, and salted fish to Wuhan for flood control and rescue workers and citizens to eat.

    全国人民支援长江淮河防汛斗争
    防汛器材和晚秋作物种籽源源运往防汛地区
    长江、淮河沿岸持久不懈的防汛斗争，得到全国各地人民同心协力的支援。从六月下旬起，大批的防汛器材和晚秋作物种籽，就源源不断地从各地运往防汛地区，以便帮助那里的人民战胜洪水，早日恢复生产。
    以北京为中心，南到广东，北到黑龙江，东到浙江、江苏和山东，西到甘肃和四川，在这样广大区域内的人民，在当地党和政府领导下，不断地把抽水机、空气压缩机、麻袋、草袋、木料、芦席、马灯、砖石等防汛器材运送到武汉市、荆江大堤、黄石市、南京市、蚌埠市以及长江、淮河沿岸。北京市从六月到八月十一日晚止，已把七十三万多条麻袋和二十九万九千多领芦席运往武汉。首都国营商业、合作社和运输等部门的人员，为了迅速装运物资，不分晴雨日夜工作。装卸工人冒雨在车站里等着卸麻袋和运芦席，他们保证随到随卸。汽车司机在雨后道路泥泞行车困难的情况下，及时把麻袋和芦席运到火车站。天津铁路运输分局七月份运往武汉、蚌埠、浦口、镇江等地的草袋、麻袋、芦席、抽水机、空气压缩机、电缆等，共装了二百八十三车皮。八月五日晚，天津铁路运输分局接到装运二十六万条麻袋到武汉去的通知。工人们在昏黑的夜里，背着麻袋走过跳板装车，保证了这批物资按时启运。上海市三百四十家打铁店和电焊店的工人，三天内赶制成一千五百只五十公斤重和一百公斤重的大铁锚，送往武汉用来拉住防护长江堤岸的木排。沈阳水泵厂生产的第一批一百四十三台带电动机的抽水机，已经从沈阳运往武汉。第二批支援淮河两岸某些地区防汛排水的一百四十一台抽水机，也已提前运抵徐州。第三批一百二十七台抽水机现正在沈阳水泵厂加紧生产，不久就可以连同三千多匹马力的柴油机运往安徽地区防汛排水。国营南昌柴油机厂职工赶制的第一批抽水机，已在七月二十六日运往涝区排水，第二批即将运出。工人们还为这些抽水机多制了一部分容易损耗的机件，以便随时调换。江苏省苏州、龙潭、镇江等地的采石厂，目前每天有一万七千吨石头运向苏北，有的已运抵洪泽湖大堤和运河东堤的各个重要地段。目前，武汉市已收到几百部抽水机，数十万条麻袋、草袋。在淮河防汛战线上，已收到各地送来的麻袋、草袋、蒲包、芦席共三百四十一万条，木料十二万根，铅丝二万三千多公斤，麻五万六千多公斤，轮船五十多只，抽水机一百四十部，以及其他各种器材物资一百多吨。许多地区还在运送的器材中附了慰问信。有封信上写道：“防汛就是战斗，物资好比弹药，你们要什么，我们就支援什么。”
    为了帮助水灾地区人民排水补种，迅速恢复生产，黑龙江、热河、浙江、江苏、山东、四川、山西、陕西、江西、河北等省和内蒙古自治区，都把大批的种籽运到长江、淮河流域。山西省人民政府在八月十日前已分两批调出荞麦、马铃薯等晚秋作物种籽三百七十二万斤，第三批正在调运的糜子、黍子种籽五百万斤也将在十八日全部运往安徽省。崞县南贾乡农业生产合作社社员们为了不误灾区农民补种需用，自动组成三个运粮大队，冒雨涉水，在两天内把二千七百五十余斤荞麦、糜子、黍子种籽背着运往附近的原平火车站。内蒙古自治区以六百一十万斤荞麦、黍子等种籽支援安徽、湖北等省灾区种晚秋作物，到十日止，已有二百二十多万斤荞麦运往蚌埠。陕西省延安专区，农民们出动一千五百头毛驴，在十天内把吴旗、安塞等三县的五十万斤荞麦种籽运到延安，以便用汽车迅速向铁路沿线转运。甘肃省决定支援安徽省马铃薯种一百一十万斤，现在正积极进行收购。目前，安徽省已收到各地运去的九千六百多万斤马铃薯、玉米、荞麦、胡萝卜、菜籽等晚秋作物种籽。
    各防汛地区还得到了各地支援的药品、粮食和蔬菜。上海支援武汉等地防汛需用的近百吨医疗药品已在十二日运出，全部药品器械共装成二千七百多箱。西南、西北地区卫生部门决定派出医师和检验人员分赴武汉、蚌埠等地协助当地开展卫生医疗工作。广东省今年早稻丰收，七月下半月在原定调粮计划之外，增调了一千万斤大米到武汉、岳阳等地供给当地人民；八月份，又调集了五千万斤大米支援这些防汛区，现正分批装运，八月二十五日前可全部运出。山西省太原和榆次、寿阳等地，从七月二十日起每天运出白菜、西红柿等新鲜蔬菜五六万斤。上海、广州、四川、内蒙古自治区和东北等地，都尽一切可能将大批瓜类、茄子、白菜、干菜以及咸鱼等副食品运往武汉，供防汛抢险人员和市民食用。　　　　　（新华社）
