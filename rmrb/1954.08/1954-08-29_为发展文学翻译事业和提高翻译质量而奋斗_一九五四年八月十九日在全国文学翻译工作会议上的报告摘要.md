    Strive to Develop Literary Translation and Improve Translation Quality
    —Summary of a Report at the National Literary Translation Work Conference on August 19, 1954
    Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association
    I. Introducing Literature from All Countries is a Glorious and Arduous Task
    Literary translation work is of utmost importance to the development of modern literature and art in our country. The Chinese people not only love the valuable literary and artistic heritage of our great motherland, which has a long history and rich content, but also cherish the outstanding creations of people from all countries in literature and art, regarding them as indispensable spiritual nourishment in their daily lives and indispensable references for the development of their own national literature and art.
      Our translation cause has a long history and a glorious tradition. The rigorous and scientific translation methods established by our predecessors in the translation of Buddhist scriptures, and the outstanding achievements they achieved, are worthy of our pride and should be regarded as a model.
    The translation of modern foreign literature can be said to have begun at the end of the nineteenth century. Lin Shu's translation of "La Dame aux Camélias" by Alexandre Dumas fils was published in woodblock edition in 1899. In the following twenty years, Lin Shu and his collaborators translated more than a hundred foreign literary works. However, Lin Shu's translation work was only a translation of the general idea, and the selection of works lacked a certain standard. It was Lu Xun, the pioneer and mentor of China's New Literature Movement, who began to introduce modern foreign literature in a serious and earnest manner with strict ideological and artistic evaluation. During the "May Fourth" period, many advanced publications, literary groups, and publishing houses, such as "New Youth," "New Tide," Creation Society, Literary Research Society, etc., successively and extensively introduced excellent foreign literary works.
    The translation and introduction of foreign literature has played a great role in encouraging and drawing lessons from the development of China's new literature. If it is said that a large part of the creation of the May Fourth New Literature grew up by absorbing the rich nourishment of the spirit of realism and democratic and socialist ideas in modern world literature, then it is not an exaggeration.
      At the same time, we must also point out that through these foreign literary works, we have gradually gained a clearer understanding of the historical traditions of the people of various countries and their lives and struggles; especially from the great Russian literature and Soviet literature after the October Revolution, we have drawn the confidence and strength needed to carry out national liberation and people's revolution.
    Due to the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, our country has achieved outstanding results in politics, economy, and culture. Along with the growth of literary creation, literary translation is also developing rapidly. According to incomplete statistics from the General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government, from October 1949 to the end of 1953, the total number of literary translation books published nationwide (including literary readings for teenagers and children) reached 2,151, with print runs ranging from tens of thousands to millions of copies.
    Our country's international status is rising day by day; the role our country plays in international affairs and the importance of its responsibilities have been generally recognized by people all over the world. In the great cause of further easing international tensions and realizing collective security and peaceful coexistence in Asia and the world, cultural exchange between countries is an important factor, and literary translation is an important link in cultural exchange.
      In order to enhance our extensive knowledge and deep understanding of the lives, struggles, thoughts, and feelings of people all over the world, to cultivate and improve our internationalist ideological sentiments, to enrich our knowledge of human spiritual culture, to expand and broaden our horizons of world literature and art, and to develop and improve our literary creation, we urgently need to intensify the translation and introduction of excellent modern foreign literary works, and at the same time, we also urgently need to intensify the translation and introduction of world classical literature.
      While we are carrying out socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of various economies with creative labor, we are also beginning to carry out socialist cultural construction. The new socialist culture must not be created in isolation, divorced from historical and global connections. Its growth and development must inherit the most valuable traditions of its own national culture on the one hand, and absorb the essence of world classical literature and modern progressive literature on the other.
    From ancient times to modern times, from East to West, all the highest achievements and excellent works of world literature are needed by the Chinese people today, must become indispensable spiritual food in the cultural life of our people, and must become nourishment for cultivating and irrigating the socialist literature and art we are creating.
    II. Literary Translation Work Must Be Carried Out in an Organized and Planned Manner
    For decades, literary translation work has achieved great results, and translation work has made great contributions to the people's cause. However, it is undeniable that there are still many problems and shortcomings in translation work, and the first is the unorganized and unplanned state of work, which is incompatible with the country's planned cultural construction.
      In the past, the vast majority of literary translation work was carried out in a decentralized and spontaneous state. From the perspective of translators, the choice of translated works was often determined solely by the translator's personal subjective preferences, and often little consideration was given to whether the translated works were worth translating, whether they were beneficial to readers, or whether they were urgently needed by readers. Some translators even considered very little whether they were competent for the translation. Translators with an insufficiently serious attitude translated carelessly. Some translators with a more serious attitude and higher ability were often unable to concentrate on their work due to lack of conditions, and many translation works that required years of painstaking effort could not be done. Some translators had to rush through work that should have been carefully polished. An important reason for this phenomenon is that in the past, the publishing industry was controlled by private publishers, and whether a translated work could be published was mainly determined by the publishers. Many translators had to cater to the demands of businessmen and could not carefully consider their own interests, abilities, and the interests of readers.
      The above-mentioned unorganized and unplanned state was unavoidable under the past reactionary rule, but it cannot be said that the state publishing organs leading this work and the organizations leading and organizing translators, such as the Writers Association, have not fulfilled their due responsibilities.
      Due to the existence of this decentralized and spontaneous unorganized and unplanned state, many chaotic phenomena have appeared in literary translation work. On the one hand, works that should be translated have not been translated, and even many important Soviet works that readers urgently need today do not have perfect translations; on the other hand, secondary, unnecessary, and even harmful literary translations and publications are flooding the market.
    The harm of being unorganized and unplanned is particularly manifested in serious duplication and waste. Translators and translators, publishers and publishers each do their own thing, without consulting each other. Work that could be completed by one translator and one publisher is often done by two, three, or even more translators and publishers at the same time or one after another, wasting a lot of manpower and material resources. We are not against retranslation, but later translations should be of higher quality than the original translations. Only such retranslation is meaningful. Some translators and publishers proceed only from their own interests, and knowing that there are other translations, and having no conditions to translate better themselves, they still do meaningless repetitions. Many retranslations are not more perfect than the original translations, and some are even worse. Some also publish translations of the same original work under a different title to deceive readers. Some books that are in urgent need by readers are translated hastily by translators and publishers who know that others are already translating them, in order to seize the market. These erroneous and bad phenomena are not allowed.
      Our country has entered a period of socialist construction and socialist transformation. All economic and cultural undertakings have gradually been incorporated into the track of organization and planning. This chaotic state of literary translation work must not be allowed to continue. Literary translation must be planned and organized under the leadership of the Party and the government, by the competent authorities and all relevant parties, to unify the formulation of plans, organize forces, and carry out work in a methodical and step-by-step manner. Especially today, when our translation force is still very weak and our tasks are very arduous, we must give full play to the due effect of the strength of every literary translator. And this is only possible by carrying out work in a planned and organized manner.
    In order to carry out literary translation work in a planned and organized manner, first of all, we must have a unified translation plan jointly formulated by literary translators across the country. Then, the state and joint state-private literary publishing houses and the "Translation" magazine specializing in introducing foreign literature, according to the urgency of needs, the situation of human resources, and the translators' expertise, qualities, and volunteers, organize translation, collation, and editing and publishing work in a step-by-step manner.
    Having only a list of topics cannot be regarded as a complete work plan. We must further solve the problem of organizing forces. Today, the vast majority of translators are engaged in translation in their spare time. Some are cadres in government agencies, some are professors in schools, and some are still studying. Only a very few are professional workers. In today's actual situation, it is not possible to make all part-time literary translators leave their original posts and become professional translators. Therefore, what we can organize is mostly part-time force. If the part-time force is well organized, it is still possible to play a greater role.
      We hope that through all the comrades attending this meeting, we can further understand and strengthen the organization of the national forces, gather and organize the personal plans of many translators into a unified plan, and organize the scattered forces into a large and united team. In order to complete this task, we must launch extensive discussions, gather everyone's wisdom, and formulate many specific methods, under the leadership of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the General Administration of Publications, to be implemented jointly by the Writers Association, relevant literary research institutions, literary publishing institutions, magazine editorial departments, and all literary translators.
  III. Literary Translation Work Must Be Raised to the Level of Artistic Creation
    Another major problem existing in literary translation work today is the problem of improving the quality of translation.
      The minimum requirement for general translation should be to convey the content of the original work faithfully and accurately with clear and fluent translations. But for literary translation, this requirement is still far from enough. Literary works are art created with language. Literary translation is to use another language tool to convey the artistic conception of the original work, so that readers can get inspiration, emotion, and aesthetic feelings when reading the translation, just like when reading the original work.
      Such translation is naturally not a purely technical change of the external form of language, but requires the translator to deeply understand the process of artistic creation of the original author through the external form of the language of the original work, to find the most suitable proof of the content of the original work in his own thoughts, feelings, and life experiences, and at the same time, he must use literary language suitable for the style of the original work to accurately and completely reproduce the content and form of the original work. The process of such translation is to unite the translator and the original author into one, as if the original author wrote his own work in another country's language. Such translation requires all the creativity of the translator, and yet it must be completely faithful to the intention of the original work, just as an actor must use his own life and artistic cultivation to create the image of the characters in the play, and the characters created must completely conform to the original intention of the playwright.
    Literary works are about describing life. Translators, like creators, also need to have life experiences. Of course, translators in general may not have the opportunity to directly experience the social environment and way of life described in foreign works, especially the ancient life of foreign countries, which is simply impossible to experience directly. If we require translators to have direct experience of a certain foreign social environment and way of life before engaging in translation, it is not only an impractical method, but also unreasonable. But we must recognize this: the richer the translator's own life experiences and life experiences, the easier it is to understand and understand the lives of different countries and different times. Experiencing all kinds of life more is also very important for a literary translator. In particular, it is very necessary and should be done as much as possible to seek experience in the similar life that the translator can contact according to the life written in the original work, just like actors have to express the life in the script and seek experience in the same life.
      Strict scientific research on the original work is a necessary task when translating a work. This first requires translators, like creators, to seriously study Marxism-Leninism, and then it is possible to comprehensively study and correctly understand the era, society, and living environment reflected in the work, as well as the author's thoughts and style. This is an arduous task, but in order to achieve artistic creative translation, such learning and research work is indispensable.
    The last important issue is the use of the language of the translation. Every language has its own grammar and usage habits. We cannot imagine that a translation method that mechanically translates the original work word by word, sentence by sentence, according to its original structural order, can properly convey the meaning of the original work. We cannot imagine that such a translation would be pure native language. Good translators read foreign languages on the one hand, but think and imagine in their own language on the other hand; only in this way can their translations get rid of the restrictions of the grammar and vocabulary peculiarities of the original text, so that the translations are both pure mother tongue and faithfully and accurately convey the meaning and style of the original work.
    Some people think that our country's vocabulary is poor, and it is not enough to apply it during translation, which has caused great difficulties. But the facts are not always the case. Language comes from life, and as life changes and develops, new vocabulary is constantly emerging. Translators, like writers, should also excavate suitable vocabulary from life, or refine new vocabulary. This is also an aspect of the creativity of the art of translation. Of course, this does not mean that we should not absorb new vocabulary and expressions from foreign works. But to absorb new vocabulary and expressions from foreign works, it must be based on the basic vocabulary and basic grammar of the native language to absorb and digest them. Simply swallowing and mechanically copying are harmful.
    As mentioned above, our requirement for improving the quality of translation is to aim at artistic creative translation. It should be pointed out that this is the goal we are striving for today. Today, we should not use this as a yardstick to measure all translations. This goal of ours is to be gradually achieved through long-term efforts, but it is completely necessary to put forward this goal today.
    IV. Strengthen Criticism and Self-Criticism and Collective Mutual Assistance in Literary Translation Work, and Cultivate New Translation Forces
      Carrying out literary translation work in an organized and planned manner, and raising literary translation work to the level of artistic creation, are our goals to strive for in the future; and strengthening criticism and self-criticism and collective mutual assistance in literary translation work, and cultivating new translation forces in large numbers, are our specific steps to achieve this goal.
    Criticism and self-criticism are always the driving force for us to improve and improve our work. In literary translation work, translators and proofreaders, translators and editors must strengthen criticism and self-criticism. It is an irresponsible attitude to be indifferent or compromise to one's own or others' shortcomings. Anyone who is arrogant and complacent and unwilling to listen humbly to all criticisms, whether correct or not completely correct, will find it difficult to improve himself from his shortcomings.
      Generally speaking, the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism in our translation community is not strong enough. Although we have made some criticisms of the casual translation attitude and shoddy translation works, and it has played a certain role, it cannot be said that this work is still done very little and not timely. We also rarely recommend and praise excellent translations. We also rarely criticize or simply do not criticize those translations that have no major flaws but are not commensurate with the excellent original works.
    Past criticisms mostly focused on pointing out mistranslations of words and sentences, and rarely made essential and comprehensive criticisms of the translation. Pointing out mistranslations of words and sentences is of course necessary, but this is not enough, and the criticism work must go further than this. We hope that future criticisms can be more comprehensively and deeply made from the essential problems of the translation, from the translator's understanding of the original work, from the correctness of the translation's transmission of the author's spirit and style, from the application of the translation's artistic language, and from the translator's work attitude and cultivation level. In this way, we can gradually establish a serious, earnest, and hard-working style and gradually improve the quality of translation.
      Complementary to criticism and self-criticism is the collective mutual assistance of translators. Translation is an individual labor, especially literary translation. If a work is translated by several translators separately, it is difficult to achieve consistency in the style and tone of the translation. Therefore, collective translation is not a very appropriate method. But another kind of collective translation, for example, several translators jointly study and discuss the original work, obtain a more comprehensive and consistent understanding, and then one translator writes the translation, and other translators help in the process of translation: such collective translation is completely possible and beneficial. The method of translating a book separately can also be tried sometimes, but the translators must have a more in-depth common study and discussion of the work, and have a common and consistent understanding of the thoughts, spirit, and style of the work, and their translation levels are about the same. In the process of translation, they conduct mutual proofreading, and finally one person is responsible for the overall proofreading. Only in this way can they complete a translation with a unified style and better quality.
      Another aspect of the spirit of collective mutual assistance is reflected in the proofreading work. Proofreading work is an important part of the translation cause. It is difficult for a translation to reach a more perfect state without being proofread. Therefore, literary translation work not only needs to organize translation forces, but also needs more proofreading forces; especially since many existing translations in the past can be re-published after revision to save the current limited translation forces, it is urgently hoped that experienced translators can also do proofreading work.
      The last link in the translation cause is the editing work of magazines or publishing houses. The editor has the responsibility to conduct the final proofreading of the translated manuscript. He is responsible to the readers on the one hand and to the translator on the other hand. He is the final guarantor of the quality of the translation. Editing work is sometimes even more arduous and difficult than proofreading work; on the one hand, he must rely on and respect the translator, and on the other hand, he must try his best to find errors, omissions, and inappropriate places in the translation. His work is not seen in the published books and published magazines, but without this work, the translated things cannot meet the vast number of readers. And because this is a final guarantee work, it needs to have a higher level. In order to do a good job of editing and organize more and better translations, they often must have a selfless spirit. Therefore, we must respect and value their work with the same respect and importance as translation work.
    Finally, cultivating new translation forces is a very urgent task today. As mentioned above, the vast majority of people engaged in part-time translation today are young people. Their professional level is generally not high, but they have potential and they are the new translation forces. The question is how to help them in a planned and regular manner so that they can gradually improve in their part-time translation work.
      Editorial departments of various magazines and state publishing houses have done a lot of work in helping young translators and have produced results, which should be affirmed. But it must be admitted that this work still lacks planning and is more passive than active. In the future, to improve this work, it is far from enough to rely on the limited forces of literary magazines and state publishing houses. All relevant parties (including cultured literary translators) must work together to enable this urgent and important work of cultivating new forces to be carried out in a planned and active manner. We firmly believe that the new team is growing vigorously, its development will be unlimited, and our common cause must rely on them to participate.
    Comrades, in order to strive for the further prosperity of the literary translation cause, we not only require a rapid increase in the number of translators, but also require a continuous and gradual improvement in the quality of translation work. This requires our literary translators to strengthen the study of political theory, improve their cultivation of literature, art, and Chinese and foreign languages, and establish a correct work attitude and a serious work style. Only in this way can they shoulder this arduous task.

    为发展文学翻译事业和提高翻译质量而奋斗
    —一九五四年八月十九日在全国文学翻译工作会议上的报告摘要
    中国作家协会主席　茅盾
    一、介绍世界各国的文学是一个光荣而艰巨的任务
    文学翻译工作，对于我国现代文学艺术的发展，具有极重要的意义。中国人民不仅热爱伟大祖国的有悠久历史和丰富内容的宝贵的文学艺术遗产，同样也珍视世界各国人民在文学艺术上的优秀创造，把它们作为自己日常生活中不可缺少的精神养料和发展自己民族文学艺术不可缺少的借鉴。
      我国的翻译事业是有悠久的历史和光荣的传统的。我们的先辈在翻译佛经方面所树立的谨严的科学的翻译方法，及其所达成的卓越成就，值得我们引以为骄傲，并且奉为典范。
    近代外国文学的翻译，可以说开始于十九世纪末年，林纾翻译的法国小仲马的“巴黎茶花女遗事”，在一八九九年就以木刻本出版了。在此后的二十多年中，林纾和他的合作者，翻译了百余种外国文学作品。但林纾的翻译工作还只是一种译大意的性质，对作品的选取，也缺乏一定的标准。从严格的思想与艺术的评价，对近代外国文学进行严肃与认真的介绍的，开始于我国新文学运动的先驱者和导师——鲁迅。“五四”时期，许多先进的刊物、文学团体、出版社，如“新青年”、“新潮”、创造社、文学研究会等等，陆续地、大量地介绍了外国优秀的文学作品。
    外国文学的翻译介绍，对于我国新文学的发展，是起了极大的鼓舞和借鉴作用的。如果说，五四新文学的创作，其中有很大部分，是由于吸取近代世界文学中现实主义精神和民主主义、社会主义思想的丰厚养料而成长起来的，那也不是一句过分夸张的话罢。
      同时我们也必须指出：通过了这些外国文学作品，我们对于世界各国人民的历史传统和他们的生活与斗争，逐渐了解得更清楚了；特别是从伟大的俄罗斯文学以及十月革命以后的苏联文学，我们吸取了为进行民族解放和人民革命所需要的信心和力量。
    由于中国人民革命的伟大胜利，我国在政治、经济、文化各方面，业已获得了卓越的成绩。和文学创作事业的成长一起，文学翻译事业，也正在迅速发展。根据中央人民政府出版总署的不完全统计，从一九四九年十月以后，到一九五三年年底止，全国出版的文学翻译书籍（包括青少年儿童的文学读物），总数达二千一百五十一种之多，每种印数，少者数万册，最多至百万册。
    我国的国际地位日益提高；我国在国际事务中所起的作用和所负的责任之重大，已为世界人士所公认。在进一步缓和国际紧张局势以及实现亚洲及世界各国的集体安全、和平共处的伟大事业中，国与国间的文化交流是一个重要的因素，而文学翻译工作，是文化交流中重要的一环。
      为了增进我们对世界各国人民生活、斗争、思想、感情的广博的知识和深切的了解，培养和提高我们国际主义的思想感情，丰富我们对人类精神文化的知识，开展和扩大我们对世界文学艺术的视野，发展和提高我们的文学创作，我们今天不但迫切需要加紧外国现代文学优秀作品的翻译介绍工作，同时，也迫切需要加紧世界古典文学的翻译介绍工作。
      在我们以创造性的劳动进行社会主义工业化和各项经济的社会主义改造同时，我们也正在开始进行社会主义的文化建设。新的社会主义文化，决不能脱离历史的和世界的联系，而孤立地创造出来的。它的成长和发展，必然是一方面继承了自己民族文化的最宝贵的传统，而又一方面则吸收了世界古典文学的和现代进步文学的精华。
    从古代到现代，从东方到西方，一切世界文学的最高成就和优秀作品，都为今天中国人民所需要，都必须成为我国人民文化生活中不可缺少的精神食粮，必须成为培养和灌溉我们正在创造中的社会主义文学艺术的养料。
    二、文学翻译工作必须有组织有计划地进行
    几十年来，文学翻译工作是有很大成绩的，翻译工作对人民的事业作了很大的贡献。但不可否认，翻译工作中也还存在着不少的问题和缺点，而首先是工作的无组织无计划状态，这是和国家有计划的文化建设不相适应的。
      在过去，极大多数的文学翻译工作，是在分散的、自流的状态中进行的。从翻译工作者来说，翻译作品的选择，常常仅凭译者个人主观的好恶来决定，而往往很少考虑所翻译的作品，是否值得翻译，是否于读者有益，为读者所迫切需要。甚至有些译者，对自己是否胜任这一翻译，也考虑得很少。态度不够严肃的译者胡乱翻译。若干态度比较严肃能力较高的译者，又往往由于缺乏条件不能安心致力于工作，许多需要长年累月，惨淡经营的翻译工作就不可能做，有些译者就只得把应该细磨细琢的工作草率了事。造成这种现象的一个重要原因，是过去出版事业掌握在私营出版商手里，翻译作品的能否出版，主要是由出版商人来决定的，许多译者不得不迁就商人的要求，而不可能周密地考虑自己的志趣、能力和读者的利益。
      上述的无组织、无计划的状态，在过去反动统治下是不可避免的，但到今天还存在，就不能不说领导这工作的国家出版机关以及领导和组织翻译工作者的团体如作家协会没有尽到应尽的责任。
      由于这种分散自流的无组织无计划状态的存在，使文学翻译工作出现了许多混乱的现象。一方面应该翻译的作品没有翻译出来，甚至今天读者所迫切需要的苏联的许多重要作品，也没有完善的译本；而另一方面，次要的，不必要的，甚至有害的文学翻译出版物，则充斥于市场。
    无组织无计划的害处，特别表现在严重的重复浪费上面。译者和译者之间，出版者与出版者之间各自为政，互不相谋，一个译者一个出版社可以完成的工作，往往有两个三个甚至更多的译者和出版社同时或先后的去做，浪费了许多人力和物力。我们并不反对复译，但后来的译本应该比原有的译本质量更高，这样的复译才有意义。有的译者和出版者只是从本身利益出发，明知已有别的译本，自己又并无条件译得更好，仍旧作无意义的重复，不少复译本并不比原来的译本完善，甚至有反而较差的。也有的将同一原作的译本改换一个书名出版，以蒙混读者。有一些比较为读者所急需的书，译者和出版者虽然明知别人已在翻译，却以粗制滥造的方法，抢先译出，以争取市场。这些错误的恶劣的现象都是不能容许的。
      我们的国家已进入社会主义建设和社会主义改造时期，一切经济、文化事业已逐渐纳入组织化计划化的轨道，文学翻译工作的这种混乱状态，决不能允许其继续存在。文学翻译必须在党和政府的领导下由主管机关和各有关方面，统一拟订计划，组织力量，有方法、有步骤地来进行。特别在今天，我们的翻译力量还非常薄弱，而我们的任务却十分艰巨，必须使每一个文学翻译工作者的力量，充分发挥其应有的效果。而这，只有有计划有组织地来进行工作，才有可能。
    为了有计划有组织地进行文学翻译工作，首先我们必须有一个全国文学翻译工作者共同拟订的统
  一的翻译计划，然后由国家及公私合营的文学出版社和专门介绍外国文学的“译文”杂志，根据现有的和可能发掘的潜在力量，分别依照需要的缓急、人力的情况和译者的专长、素养和志愿，有步骤地组织翻译、校订和编审出版的工作。
    仅仅有一个选题目录，还不能算作完整的工作计划，我们必须进一步解决组织力量的问题。今天极大部分的翻译者是在业余从事翻译的，他们有的是机关干部，有的是学校教授，有的还在学习中，只有极少数是专业工作者。而在今天的实际情况下，也还不可能使一切兼任的文学翻译工作者，都从他们原来的工作岗位中脱离出来，变成专业的翻译工作者，因此我们可能组织起来的，大部分还只是业余的力量。业余的力量，如果组织得好，也仍有可能发挥较大的作用。
      我们希望通过出席这次会议的全体同志进一步了解和加紧组织全国的力量，把许多翻译工作者的个人计划，集合而组织成一个统一的计划，把分散的力量，组织成一个步调一致的广大的队伍。为着完成这一任务，必须展开广泛的讨论，集合大家的智慧订出许多具体的办法，在中央人民政府文化部、出版总署领导下，由作家协会、有关的文学研究机关、文学出版机关、刊物编辑部和全体文学翻译工作者共同来执行。
  三、必须把文学翻译工作提高到艺术创造的水平
    今天文学翻译工作中所存在的另一个主要的问题，是提高翻译质量的问题。
      对于一般翻译的最低限度的要求，至少应该是用明白畅达的译文，忠实正确地传达原作的内容。但对于文学翻译，仅仅这样要求还是很不够的。文学作品是用语言创造的艺术，文学的翻译是用另一种语言工具，把原作的艺术意境传达出来，使读者在读译文的时候能够像读原作时一样得到启发、感动和美的感受。
      这样的翻译，自然不是单纯技术性的语言外形的变易，而是要求译者通过原作的语言外形，深切体会原作者的艺术创造的过程，在自己的思想、感情、生活体验中找到关于原作内容的最适合的印证，同时还必须运用适合于原作风格的文学语言，把原作的内容与形式正确无遗地再现出来。这样的翻译的过程，是把译者和原作者合而为一，好像原作者用另外一国文字写自己的作品。这样的翻译既需要译者的全部的创造性，而又要完全忠实于原作的意图，好像一个演员必须以自己的生活和艺术修养来创造剧中人物的形象，而创造出来的人物，又必须完全符合于剧作者原来的意图一样。
    文学作品是描写生活的，译者和创作者一样，也需要有生活的体验。当然，一般译者对于外国作品中所描写的社会环境与生活方式，未必都有可能去直接体验一番，特别是对于外国古代的生活，简直不可能有直接的体验。如果我们要求译者必先对于某一外国的社会环境和生活方式有了直接的体验，然后才来从事翻译，那就不但是不合实际的办法，而且也是不合情理的。但我们却必须认识这一点：译者自己的生活经历与生活体验愈丰富，对于不同国家与不同时代的生活也愈容易体会和了解。更多地体验各色各样的生活，对于一个文学翻译者也是非常重要的。特别是根据原作所写的生活，在译者自己可以接触到的类似的生活中去找求体验，好像演员要表现剧本中的生活，到同样的生活中去找求体验一样，是很必要而且应该尽可能去做的。
      对原作进行严格的科学研究，是翻译一部作品时必需做的工作。这就首先要求翻译者也和创作者
  一样必须认真学习马克思列宁主义，然后才有可能全面地研究和正确地理解作品所反映的时代、社会和生活环境，以及作者的思想和风格。这是艰巨的工作，然而，为要达成艺术的创造性的翻译，这样的学习和研究工作是不可缺少的。
    最后一个重要的问题，是译文语言的运用问题。每种语文都有它自己的语法和语汇的使用习惯，我们不能想像把原作逐字逐句，按照其原来的结构顺序机械地翻译过来的翻译方法，能够恰当地传达原作的意义，我们也不能想像这样的译文会是纯粹的本国文字。好的翻译者一方面阅读外国文字，一方面却以本国的语言进行思索和想像；只有这样才能使自己的译文摆脱原文的语法和语汇的特殊性的拘束，使译文既是纯粹的祖国语言，而又忠实正确地传达了原作的意义和风格。
    有人以为我国的语汇贫乏，翻译时不够应用，造成了很大的困难。但事实却不尽然。语言是从生活中产生出来的，生活在变化、在发展，新的语汇也在陆续出现。翻译者和作家一样，也应当从生活中去发掘适合的语汇，或者提炼出新的语汇，这也是翻译艺术的创造性的一个方面。当然，这并不等于说，我们就不应当从外国作品中去吸收新的语汇和表现方法。但要从外国作品中去吸收新的语汇和表现方法，必须是在本国语言的基本语汇与基本语法的基础上去吸收而加以融化。生吞活剥，杜撰硬搬，都是有害的。
    如上所述，我们对于提高翻译质量的要求，是以艺术的创造性的翻译为目标。应当指出：这是今天我们努力以赴的目标。在今天，我们还不宜用这作为尺度去衡量一切译本。我们这一目标是要经过长期的努力而逐步达到的，但今天提出这一目标，是完全有必要的。
    四、加强文学翻译工作中的批评与自我批评和集体互助
      精神，培养新的翻译力量
    有组织有计划地进行文学翻译工作，和把文学翻译工作提高到艺术创造的水平，是我们今后要努力的一个目标；而加强文学翻译工作中的批评与自我批评和集体互助，大批地培养新的翻译力量，是我们达到这个目标的具体步骤。
    批评与自我批评，永远是我们改进和提高工作的动力。在文学翻译工作中，译者和校订者之间，译者和编辑者之间，必须加强批评与自我批评。不论对自己的或别人的缺点表示冷淡或妥协，都是一种不负责任的态度。任何骄傲自满、对一切不论是正确的或不完全正确的批评不肯虚心倾听的人，很难从缺点中来改进自己。
      一般说来，我们翻译界的批评与自我批评的空气是不够浓厚的。对于轻率的翻译态度、粗制滥造的翻译作品，我们虽然也作了一些批评，而且也起了一定的作用，但不能不说，这个工作还是做得很少，而且不及时。对于优秀的译本，我们也很少推荐和表扬。对于那些译文虽无大疵、却与优秀的原作不相称的译本，也很少批评或简直没有批评。
    过去的一些批评大多侧重于指摘字句的误译，而很少就译本作本质的、全面的批评。指摘字句的误译，当然也是需要的，但这是不够的，批评工作还必须比这更进一步。我们希望今后的批评能够更多地从译文的本质的问题上，从译者对原作的理解上，从译本传达作者精神、风格的正确性上，从译文艺术语言的运用上，以及从译者的劳动态度与修养水平上，来作全面的深入的批评，这样，才能逐渐地树立起严肃、认真、刻苦钻研的作风，达到逐渐提高翻译质量的目的。
      和批评与自我批评相辅而行的，是翻译工作者的集体互助。翻译是一种个体劳动，尤其是文学翻译。如果把一个作品由几个译者分译，要想求得译文风格情调的一致是有困难的，因此集体翻译不是很适当的办法。但另外的一种集体翻译，例如由几个译者共同来研究和讨论原作，取得比较全面的一致的认识，然后由一个译者来执笔翻译，经其他译者在翻译的过程中进行帮助：这样的集体翻译完全是可能而且有益的。一书分译的办法，有时也可试行，但必须合译者对于作品有比较深入的共同研究和讨论，对作品的思想、精神、风格，有共同一致的认识，而他们翻译的水平又是差不多。在翻译过程中，彼此进行互校，最后有一个人负责总校，这样才可能完成风格统一，质量较好的翻译。
      集体互助精神的又一方面，表现在校订工作上。校订工作是翻译事业中重要的一环。一种译本没有经过校订，是很难达到较完善的地步的。所以，文学翻译工作中不但需要组织翻译的力量，同时也需要有更多的校订的力量；特别是由于过去许多已有的翻译，有的可以经过修订而重新出版，以节省目前有限的翻译力量，因此迫切地期望有经验的翻译工作者同时也做校订的工作。
      翻译事业的最后一环是刊物或出版社的编辑工作。编辑负有对译稿进行最后一次校订的责任，他
  一方面对读者负责，另一方面对译者负责，他是翻译质量的最后的保证人。编辑工作有时甚至比校订工作更艰苦，更困难；他一方面要依靠译者，尊重译者，另一方面又必须尽量发现译文的错误、疏忽和不适当的地方。他的工作在出版的书籍上和发表的刊物上是见不到的，但缺少了这一工作，翻译的东西就不可能与广大的读者见面。而且因为这是一种最后保证的工作，需要有较高的水平。他们为着做好编辑工作，组织更多更好的翻译，常常必须具备忘我的精神，因此我们必须以对翻译工作同样的尊敬与重视，来尊敬和重视他们的工作。
    最后，培养翻译的新生力量，在今天是十分迫切的任务。上面已经说过，今天从事业余翻译的极大多数人是青年，他们的业务水平一般地还不高，但他们是有前途的，他们是翻译的新生力量。问题是在怎样有计划地经常地帮助他们，使他们能在业余的翻译工作中逐步提高。
      各刊物编辑部和国家出版社，在帮助青年的翻译工作者这方面，曾经做了不少工作，也产生了效果，这是应当肯定的。但是毋庸讳言，这种工作还缺少计划化，还是被动的多，主动的少。今后要改进这一工作，单靠文学刊物和国家出版社的有限的力量，是很不够的。必须由各有关方面（包括有修养的文学翻译者）共同协力，使得培养新生力量这一迫切而重要的工作能够有计划地、主动地进行。我们深信：新的队伍，正在旺盛的成长起来，它的发展将不可限量，我们的共同事业，必须依靠他们来参加。
    同志们，为了争取文学翻译事业的进一步繁荣，我们不但要求翻译工作者数量上的迅速增长，而且也要求翻译工作质量的不断的逐步提高。这就需要我们文学翻译工作者加强政治理论学习，提高文学艺术和中外语文的修养，树立正确的劳动态度和严肃的工作作风，只有这样，才能担负起这个艰巨的任务。
