Xinjiang is located on the frontier of our motherland, inhabited by thirteen fraternal ethnic groups. It has vast and fertile land, abundant pastures, and rich underground mineral resources. However, due to the cruel oppression and exploitation of the people of all ethnic groups by the reactionary regimes of the past and the local feudal landlords and bullies, and the incitement of disputes between ethnic groups, the ethnic groups were in a state of mutual distrust and hostility, resulting in the long-term backwardness of Xinjiang's ethnic groups in politics, economy, culture, and education.

In 1949, Xinjiang was peacefully liberated, ending years of national oppression and ushering in a new era of equality, friendship, and unity among all ethnic groups. Living in the harmonious family of the motherland, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, under the brilliant light of the Communist Party's national policy, truly enjoy national equality. In the past four years, thanks to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and the brotherly assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang and the Han people, a series of social reform movements, such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, have been carried out on the basis of national unity. The special agents and bandits of the US imperialists and their running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, have been eliminated, social order has been stabilized, and the people's democratic dictatorship has been consolidated. As a result, production has been restored and developed, the people's lives have gradually improved, and the social face of Xinjiang has undergone great changes. Now, Xinjiang presents a new and prosperous atmosphere in politics, economy, and culture, and a new relationship of unprecedented equality, friendship, mutual assistance, and unity has been established among all ethnic groups.

Implementing the Policy of National Regional Autonomy

According to the Communist Party's policy of national regional autonomy, Xinjiang has established fourteen autonomous regions at the county, district, and township levels for the Mongolian, Hui, Daur, Kirgiz, Tajik, and Xibe ethnic groups from the second half of last year to May of this year. The long-cherished desire of these ethnic groups to be masters of their own affairs has been realized. The implementation of regional autonomy has further strengthened the love of the people of all ethnic groups for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. They said, "Chairman Mao really knows what is in our hearts. In the past, our minority ethnic groups could not hold our heads up and lived a dark life. Today, we have raised our heads and truly seen the sun." The unity among the ethnic groups and within the ethnic groups has also been further strengthened. For example, when the Mongolian people in the Shahan Wusong Mongolian Autonomous Region of Zhaosu County celebrated the Spring Festival, the people of Kazakh, Kirgiz, Russian and other ethnic groups voluntarily took out 18 poods of rice, 2.5 poods of flour, 4.5 pieces of tea, 7 meters of white cloth, and more than 150,000 yuan to send to poor Mongolian herdsmen. The problem of disunity between the large and small mosques, which had not been resolved for many years by the Hui people in the Dongbazha Township Hui Autonomous Region of Shanshan County, was also resolved after the establishment of the autonomous region.

Reforming the Land System

After the liberation of Xinjiang, the agricultural areas of the province, with a population of nearly four million, launched a rent reduction and anti-hegemony movement against the cruel oppression and exploitation of the landlord class, severely打击了 feudal system. Through the rent reduction and anti-hegemony movement, 70% of the farmers in Xinjiang obtained more than 209.7 million catties of wheat as a result of the struggle, improving the farmers' lives and increasing their enthusiasm for production. Following this, the movement to reform the land system was launched successively in all agricultural areas of nine special districts and fifty-four counties throughout Xinjiang, totaling 1,520 townships. In this movement, the policy of prudence and steady progress and various policies were strictly implemented, especially the policy of freedom of religious belief and the policy of protecting animal husbandry, industry, and commerce. According to statistics from 990 townships, 3,168,317 mu of land were confiscated from landlords in the struggle to reform the land system, and together with the requisitioned land, the total was 4,366,048 mu. All of this land was reasonably distributed to 451,820 households, totaling 1,247,498 poor and hired peasants. At the same time, the middle peasants and other working people in the rural areas who lacked land were also properly taken care of. An average of 2.3 mu of land was distributed to each person. Because the peasants had their own land and other means of production, their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high.

Agricultural Production

In the past four years, the total planting area of ​​all crops in Xinjiang has increased greatly. In 1953, the planting area reached 20 million mu, an expansion of 4.1 million mu compared with 1949. The total grain output in 1953 was 3.2 billion catties, an increase of 1 billion catties compared with 1949. Due to the development of agricultural production, the grain of Yanqi and Hami special districts, which had historically been short of grain, not only achieved self-sufficiency, but also had a surplus.

In the past four years, the People's Government has supplied more than one million pieces of various small old-fashioned agricultural tools and 6,300 pieces of new-style agricultural tools to help farmers of all ethnic groups develop production. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas has also been further consolidated and developed. There are now 58,773 mutual aid teams, of which year-round mutual aid teams account for 0.5%, and the organized farmers account for 30% of the total number of agricultural households. The wheat yield of twelve mutual aid teams in counties such as Heshuo, Korla, Aksu, and Shule averaged 246 catties per mu, which was 30% more than the yield of ordinary farmers. The Yanqi Yasheng Agricultural Production Cooperative planted corn on 25 mu of land, with an average yield of 863 catties per mu, which was 50% to 63% higher than the yield of ordinary farmers in the area. In 1953, there were ten agricultural production cooperatives in Xinjiang, and this year it is planned to develop 40 new agricultural production cooperatives.

Xinjiang is a province with little rainfall, so water conservancy construction is the basic key to developing agricultural production. In the past four years, with the concerted efforts of the military and civilians, the Hongyanchi Reservoir and the Heping Water Canal have been built, and more than 50,000 large and small canals have been renovated, with a total length of more than 30,000 kilometers. In particular, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang has carried out many large-scale water conservancy projects, such as the 18th Regiment Canal, the First Liberation Canal, and the First Red Star Canal. The water conservancy projects built in the past four years can irrigate more than 5 million mu of land.

Animal Husbandry Production

As a result of implementing the policy of protecting and developing animal husbandry and implementing the policy of protecting the economy of herd owners and benefiting both herd workers and herd owners, the herdsmen have greatly enhanced their enthusiasm for developing animal husbandry production and their confidence in managing animal husbandry. In the past four years, the National Bank has provided loans of 14.8 billion yuan, and at the same time, it has also distributed a lot of relief funds. Since last year, it has been changed to issuing a part of relief sheep. The government has also helped herdsmen prevent natural disasters, harvest winter grass, build livestock pens, prevent livestock diseases, and promote fine breeds of livestock. Animal husbandry production has been greatly developed. In 1953, the number of large and small livestock increased by 44.97% compared with 1949. Due to the annual expansion of foreign trade, a vast sales channel has been opened up for animal products. In the past four years, the price of livestock hair has increased by 14 times, and the price of sheepskin in exchange for white fine cloth has increased by 8.5 times. The price of local products has increased, and the lives of herdsmen have gradually improved. For example, the first township of the third district of Puli County is a pure pastoral area inhabited by the Tajik ethnic group. In 1953, the purchasing power per person increased three times compared with the time of liberation. In order to treat and prevent livestock diseases, the government has trained veterinary technicians and established 57 veterinary workstations in various special districts and counties, and issued medicinal materials and equipment worth about 5 billion yuan to various places, and also trained folk veterinarians. By the first half of 1953, a total of more than 5 million livestock of various diseases had been prevented and treated. In addition, 873 wolf-fighting teams were organized to protect livestock. Thanks to the People's Government's assistance in solving the herdsmen's difficulties in lacking wolf-fighting tools such as hunting guns and wolf traps, a total of more than 8,900 wolves of all sizes were killed from 1952 to 1953, and the harm of wolves was greatly reduced.

Industrial Construction

Before liberation, Xinjiang basically had no industry. In the past four years, with the selfless labor of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang and the concerted efforts of the people of all ethnic groups, as well as the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, large-scale modern industries such as the August 1st Iron and Steel Plant, Automobile Repair Plant, Textile Factory, Power Plant, Hydropower Plant, Cement Plant, Flour Mill, and the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company and Non-ferrous Metals Company have been established. The establishment of these industries has supplied the people of all ethnic groups with living materials and agricultural and pastoral means of production, trained a large number of workers and technical cadres of all ethnic groups, and prepared good conditions for further industrial construction.

Cultural, Educational and Health Work

Xinjiang Nationalities Institute currently has 860 students from eleven ethnic groups. There are currently 69 secondary schools with 25,396 students, an increase of 161% compared with before liberation. In the past four years, 9,213 students have graduated from secondary schools, some of whom have continued their studies, and some have been assigned to work in various places according to their needs. In 1952, a workers' and peasants' quick-completion middle school was established in Urumqi, and there are currently 200 cadres from workers' and peasants' backgrounds of all ethnic groups participating in the study. There are now a total of 1,940 primary schools in the province, with 368,345 students. The number of schools has increased by 3% compared with before liberation, and the number of students has increased by 78%. The number of children of workers and peasants in schools at all levels has increased; secondary schools have given special consideration to students from remote areas and ethnic groups with small populations when enrolling students; the proportion of women among students is also increasing year by year. Before liberation, the cultural and educational levels of ethnic groups such as Tajik, Kirgiz, and Mongolian, who lived in remote areas, were more backward than those of other ethnic groups. After liberation, these ethnic groups received special care from the Party and the People's Government. For example, in 1952, the Tajik ethnic group in Puli County had 1,678 students (including a small number of Kirgiz students), an increase of seven times compared with the time of liberation. The number of Kirgiz students in Wuqia County has increased by more than twenty times.

In the past four years, a total of 115 medical institutions have been restored and established, 404 local medical cadres have been trained, and 141 people have been selected and sent to Beijing, Lanzhou, and other places for further study. Health institutions in various places have carried out vaccinations against various infectious diseases in a timely manner, greatly reducing the transmission of various diseases. Poor patients from all ethnic groups are given free treatment. At present, an average of more than 1,300 outpatient visits and 270 hospital beds are treated free of charge every day in Xinjiang. The People's Government attaches great importance to protecting the health of mothers and infants. In the past four years, 3,884 midwives have been transformed and trained, and 11,143 maternal and child health workers have been trained. The People's Government and the People's Liberation Army have sent more than 100 medical work teams and medical work groups to the remote rural and pastoral areas to provide free medical care to the people of all ethnic groups.

In the past four years, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have deeply realized from their own lives that only in the free and equal family of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, can the equality and unity of all ethnic groups be achieved, and can the development of various undertakings be achieved. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups love Chairman Mao more and more, and trust and support the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government more and more.

    新疆的新面貌
    新疆省人民政府委员兼民政厅厅长  穆义提（维吾尔族）
    新疆在我们祖国的边疆，居住着十三个兄弟民族，这里有广阔肥沃的土地、水草丰盛的牧场和丰富的地下矿藏。但是由于历代反动政权和当地封建地主、恶霸对各族人民进行残酷的压迫和剥削，挑拨民族间的纠纷，各民族间曾处于互不信任和互相仇视的状态，因而造成了新疆各民族在政治、经济、文化教育方面长期落后的状况。
    一九四九年，新疆和平解放了，从此结束了多年来的民族压迫，开始了各民族平等、友爱、团结的新时代。生活在祖国和睦大家庭中的新疆各族人民，在共产党民族政策的光辉照耀下，真正享受到了民族平等。四年来，由于中国共产党和人民政府的领导及驻新疆人民解放军和汉族人民兄弟般的帮助，在民族团结的基础上，进行了镇压反革命等一系列的社会改革运动，肃清了美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派的特务土匪，安定了社会秩序，巩固了人民民主专政。从而恢复与发展了生产，逐步改善了人民的生活，新疆的社会面貌有了很大转变。现在新疆在政治经济文化方面都呈现了一种欣欣向荣的新气象，各民族之间也建立了空前未有的平等友爱互助团结的新关系。
    贯彻民族区域自治政策
    根据共产党的民族区域自治政策，新疆从去年下半年至今年五月共建立了相当于县、区、乡级的蒙族、回族、达呼尔族、柯尔克兹族、塔吉克族、锡伯族等十四个自治区，这些民族多年来所盼望的当家作主的愿望得到实现。实行了区域自治更加加强了各族人民对共产党和毛主席的热爱，他们说：“毛主席真知道咱们心里的事，过去我们少数民族抬不起头来，过着黑暗的生活，今天我们抬起了头，真正见到了太阳。”各民族之间的团结和本民族内部的团结也更加加强了，如昭苏县莎汉乌松蒙族自治区的哈萨克、柯尔克兹、俄罗斯等民族人民在蒙族过春节时，自动拿出了十八普特大米，二普特半面粉，四块半茶叶，七公尺白布，十五万多元人民币送给贫苦的蒙族牧民。鄯善县东巴札尔乡回族自治区的回民多年来未能解决的大寺与小寺之间的不团结的问题，在成立自治区后也得到了解决。
    改革土地制度
    新疆解放后，全疆将近四百万人口的农业地区，展开了反对地主阶级的残酷压迫与剥削的减租反霸运动，严重地打击了封建制度，经过减租反霸运动，全疆百分之七十的农民获得了二亿零九万七千多斤小麦的斗争果实，改善了农民的生活，提高了农民的生产积极性。接着在这个基础上，全疆九个专区，五十四个县的全部农业地区，计一千五百二十个乡中先后展开了改革土地制度运动。在这一运动中，严格地执行了慎重稳进的方针和各项政策，特别是坚决执行了宗教信仰自由政策，及保护畜牧业、工商业的政策。根据九百九十个乡的统计，改革土地制度斗争中没收了地主的土地三百一十六万八千三百一十七亩，连同征收土地，全部共计四百三十六万六千○四十八亩。这些土地全部合理地分配给了四十五万一千八百二十户，计一百二十四万七千四百九十八名贫雇农。同时还适当地照顾了缺少土地的中农和农村中的其他劳动人民。平均每人分得了二亩三分地。由于农民有了自己的土地和分得的其他生产资料，生产积极性空前提高了。
      农业生产
    四年来，新疆全部农作物种植面积有了很大的增加，一九五三年种植面积到达二千万亩，较一九四九年扩大了四百一十万亩。粮食总产量一九五三年为三十二亿斤，较一九四九年增产十亿斤。由于农业生产的发展，使历史上一贯缺粮的焉耆、哈密两专区的粮食不但达到了自给，而且有余。
    四年来人民政府供应了各种小型旧式农具百万件以上，新式农具六千三百件，帮助各族农民发展生产。农村中的互助合作运动也有进一步的巩固与发展。互助组已达五万八千七百七十三个，其中常年互助组占百分之○点五，组织起来的农户占农业总户数百分之三十。和硕、库尔勒、阿克苏、疏勒等县的十二个互助组的小麦产量平均每亩二百四十六斤，较一般农民的产量多百分之三十。焉耆牙生农业生产合作社，在二十五亩地上种了包谷，平均每亩产量八百六十三斤，超过当地一般农民的产量百分之五十至六十三。一九五三年新疆有十个农业生产合作社，今年计划新发展四十个农业生产合作社。
    新疆是一个缺雨的省份，因而水利建设是发展农业生产的基本关键。四年来，在军民一致努力下，建设了红雁池水库与和平水渠，整修大小渠道五万多条，共长三万余公里。特别是驻新疆的人民解放军进行了许多大规模的水利工程，如十八团渠、解放第一渠、红星第一渠等。四年来建筑的水利工程已可增灌土地五百多万亩。
    畜牧业生产
    由于贯彻了保护与发展畜牧业的方针，实行了保护牧主经济和实行牧工牧主两利政策的结果，牧区人民大大增强了发展畜牧业生产的积极性和经营畜牧业的信心。四年来，国家银行贷放了一百四十八亿元的贷款，同时还发放了不少的救济款，从去年开始改为发放一部分救济羊。政府又帮助牧民防止自然灾害、收割冬草、修盖畜圈、防止牲畜疾病，并推广了优良种畜，畜牧业生产有了很大发展。一九五三年大小牲畜较一九四九年增加了百分之四十四点九七。由于对外贸易逐年扩大，因而给畜产品开辟了广大的销路。四年来牲畜的毛价提高了十四倍，羊皮换白细布的价格提高了八点五倍。土产价格提高了，牧民生活逐步改善。如蒲犁县三区一乡是一个塔吉克族居住的纯牧区，一九五三年平均每个人的购买力，比解放时提高了三倍。为了治疗和预防牲畜疾病，政府培养了兽医技术人员，并在各专区、县设立兽医工作站五十七处，向各地发出了价值约五十亿元的药料器材，又培养了民间兽医。至一九五三年上半年共计预防注射、治疗各种病畜五百余万只。此外并组织了八百七十三个打狼组，保护了牲畜，由于人民政府帮助牧民群众解决猎枪、狼铗等打狼工具缺乏的困难，在一九五二到一九五三年内共打死大小狼八千九百余只，狼害大大减轻。
    工业建设
    解放前，新疆基本上没有工业，四年来，经过驻新疆人民解放军的忘我的劳动和各族人民一致的努力，以及苏联无私的援助，先后建立了八一钢铁厂、汽车修配厂、纺织厂、发电厂、水电厂、水泥厂、面粉厂以及中苏石油公司、有色金属公司等大规模的近代化工业。这些工业的建立，供应了各族人民生活资料与农牧民的生产资料，培养了大批各民族的工人与技术干部，为进一步地工业建设准备了良好的条件。
    文化教育卫生工作
    新疆民族学院现有包括十一个民族的学生八百六十人。中等学校目前有六十九所，学生二万五千三百九十六人，较解放前增加了百分之一百六十一。四年来中等学校毕业学生有九千二百一十三人，他们有的继续升学，有的根据需要分配到各地工作。一九五二年在乌鲁木齐市成立了工农速成中学，现有各族工农出身的干部二百名参加学习。全省现共有小学一千九百四十所，学生三十六万八千三百四十五人，学校数目较解放前增加了百分之三，学生数目增加了百分之七十八。在各级学校中工农子弟人数增加了；中等学校招生时特别照顾了边远地区和人口少的民族的学生；学生中的妇女比例也在逐年增加。解放前生活在边远地区的塔吉克、柯尔克兹、蒙古等民族的文化教育较其他民族更为落后，解放后这些民族得到了党和人民政府的特别照顾，如蒲犁县的塔吉克族在一九五二年即有学生一千六百七十八名（内有少数柯尔克兹族学生），较解放时增加了七倍。乌恰县柯尔克兹族学生人数增加了二十倍以上。
     四年来，共恢复与建立了一百一十五个医疗机构，培养了四百零四名本地医务干部，并选送一百四十一人去北京和兰州等地学习深造。各地卫生机构适时地进行了各种传染病的预防注射，大大减少了各种疾病的传染。对各族劳动人民贫苦患者，予以免费治疗。现在全疆平均每日受免费治疗的有一千三百多个门诊号和二百七十架病床。人民政府对保护母亲与婴儿的健康也极为重视，四年来改造和训练了三千八百八十四名产婆，训练了妇幼保健员一万一千一百四十三名。人民政府和人民解放军，曾派了一百多个医疗工作队和医疗工作组，深入到辽远的农村、牧区，为各族人民免费医疗。
    四年来，新疆各族人民从自己切身的生活中，深刻地体会到只有在中华人民共和国自由平等的大家庭里，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，才能得到各民族的平等团结，才能得到各项事业的发展，因而各族人民越来越爱戴毛主席，越来越信任和拥护中国共产党和人民政府。
