After Signing a Transportation Contract, Datong Mining Bureau and Railway Bureau Shorten Loading Time and Accelerate Vehicle Turnover

    The Datong Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province signed a transportation contract with the Datong Railway Transportation Sub-bureau in June. According to the inspection conducted by the Mining Bureau's mines on the implementation of the contract in the latter half of the month (June 22 to July 6), the bureau shortened loading time by more than 1,300 vehicle-hours, with an average reduction of 21 minutes per batch of vehicles, equivalent to an increase of four vehicles in operation per day.
    Previously, due to the long waiting time for loading, trains were often delayed, disrupting the transportation operation plan, which resulted in the railway bureau not being able to deliver train cars according to the plan. This year, the production task of the Datong Mining Bureau has increased by nearly 40% compared to last year. To ensure the completion of the heavy transportation and sales tasks, the Datong Mining Bureau and the Datong Railway Transportation Sub-bureau signed a transportation contract in June, strictly stipulating the loading time.
    After the contract was signed, the mines strengthened the leadership of the operations section. For example, the deputy director of the No. 2 Mine frequently went to the coal yard to check the loading situation and solve problems in a timely manner. All mines, in accordance with the contract, made car allocation plans in advance, strengthened contact between administrators and stations, made all preparations, and organized workers to wait for the cars on time, so that they could start loading coal as soon as the cars arrived. The mines also seized the links that affected the loading time, adjusted the labor organization, and improved field management. The employees of each mine also launched a labor emulation campaign centered on the implementation of the contract. The workers put forward the slogans "Race against the locomotives" and "Strive for not exceeding one minute." Since the implementation of the contract, the attendance rate of loading workers in the No. 2 Mine has consistently remained above 96%, and the phenomenon of being late or leaving early has been basically eliminated. Once, during loading at the Yongdingzhuang coal yard, Yuan Shengui's group had a large tonnage, and Wang Sanshu's group voluntarily transferred two workers to help. Under the general goal of implementing the transportation contract, the loading group, coal preparation group, and electromechanical maintenance group also signed joint contracts.
    After the mines earnestly implemented the contract, they basically overcame the phenomena of "waiting for loading" and "late departure," and shortened the loading time. According to the statistics from June 22 to July 6, the bureau shortened a total of 1,352 vehicle-hours.

    大同矿务局和铁路局签订运输合同后
    缩短装车时间加速了车辆周转
    山西大同矿务局在六月间和大同铁路运输分局签订了运输合同。据矿务局各矿执行合同后半个月的检查（六月二十二日至七月六日），全局共缩短装车时间一千三百多车小时，平均每批车辆缩短二十一分钟，等于每天增加运用车四辆。
    以前由于火车待装时间长，经常晚发车，打乱了运输作业计划，致使路局方面不能按计划送车皮。今年大同矿务局的生产任务比去年增加近百分之四十，为保证完成繁重的运销任务，大同矿务局和大同铁路运输分局于六月份签订了运输合同，严格地规定了装车时间。
    合同签订后，各矿加强了对营运科的领导，如二矿副矿长经常赴煤场检查装车情况，及时解决问题。各矿都按照合同规定，事先做好配车计划，加强管理员与车站的联系，并做好一切准备工作，组织各组工人按时等车，车一到就动手装煤。各矿还抓住影响装车时间的环节，调整劳动组织，改善了场面管理。各矿职工也开展了以实现合同为中心的劳动竞赛。工人们提出了“要与火车头赛跑”、“为不超过一分钟而奋斗”的口号，二矿自贯彻合同后，装车工人出勤率经常保持在百分之九十六以上，迟到早退现象已基本消灭。永定庄煤场有一次装车的时候，袁生贵组吨数多，王三戍组自动拨了两名工人去帮助。在为着贯彻运输合同的总目标下，装车组、选煤组、机电检修组还订立了联系合同。
    各矿认真执行合同后，基本上克服了“待装”和“晚发车”现象，缩短了装车时间。据六月二十二日至七月六日的统计，全局共缩短一千三百五十二车小时。
