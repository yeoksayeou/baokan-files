Farmers in Wangjia Township, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, are actively engaging in production for self-salvation. After the dikes and embankments of Wangjia Township were breached by floods in late June, the Dongtingwei Agricultural Production Cooperative of the township made unified arrangements based on the cooperative's labor force and each person's strengths, ensuring that both production and disaster relief were carried out without neglecting either. At the same time, it is also planned that each household should raise at least one pig to ensure the fulfillment of the plan to sell ten tons of pork to the state. The Fujia Mountain Agricultural Production Cooperative has organized its labor force into a land reclamation team, planning to reclaim more than 140 mu of wasteland in Dongxiang, and has also organized 45 people and 12 boats for fishing. 社员 of the Wanjia cooperative borrowed three vats from local farmers on their second day in Dongxiang to accumulate fertilizer, and also borrowed and transported thirty hoes and rakes, and transplanted 20,000 sweet potato seedlings in a few days. All five agricultural cooperatives in the township have formulated longer-term plans for production and self-salvation. Under the impetus of the agricultural cooperatives, the farmers in the township are in high spirits and are now actively carrying out various production activities.

    王家乡农民进行生产自救
    湖南湘阴县王家乡农民积极进行生产自救。六月下旬，洪水冲溃了王家乡的堤垸后，该乡洞庭围农业生产合作社根据全社的劳动力和各人的特长作了统一的安排，做到生产救灾两不误。同时还计划每家至少要喂一只猪，保证完成卖给国家十吨猪肉的计划。傅家山农业生产合作社，把劳动力组成一支开荒大队，计划在东乡开一百四十多亩荒，还组织了四十五人、十二只船捕鱼。万家社社员在来到东乡第二天，就向当地农民借了三口缸积肥，还借来和运来了三十把锄头、耙头，几天就插上了两万蔸红薯苗。全乡五个农业社都订了较长期的生产自救计划。在农业社的带动下，全乡农民情绪都很高，现在积极进行各项生产。
