Wheat in most agricultural areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has ripened, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Farmers everywhere are busily engaged in harvesting. This year, the wheat is generally growing sturdily with full kernels. According to preliminary estimates, the wheat yield for the entire region can exceed the planned yield by 10% and increase by 20% compared to last year. The more than 1,000 mu of wheat sown by eleven agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Baotou City this year have fat, long ears, and are expected to increase production by more than 60,000 jin.

Currently, Party and government leading organs at all levels are actively leading the wheat harvest work. The Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the Autonomous Region People's Government has dispatched two work teams to the key banners and counties of the Hetao Administrative Region and the Hulunbuir League to help local areas carry out wheat harvest competitions and seed selection work based on mutual aid and cooperation organizations. ××× In the eastern region of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, crops such as sorghum, millet, corn, and soybeans are growing well. Zhelimumeng, a famous grain-producing area with more than 10 million mu of cultivated land, has basically completed summer hoeing. The sorghum has been bundled and is already tasseling, the corn is forming cobs, and the millet has also formed grains. It is estimated that this year, production can increase by more than 10% on the basis of the original planned grain output of 750,000 tons.

This year, farmers of all ethnic groups in the eastern region of Inner Mongolia have attached importance to improving agricultural cultivation techniques. Before summer hoeing, farmers learned the technology of using shovel tillers, so that the shovel tillers loaned by the state could give full play to their role. More than 16,300 production committee members and production activists in six banners and counties of Zhelimumeng learned the techniques of seed mixing, pest control, thinning, and the use of new farm tools, driving the majority of farmers to improve their techniques. Therefore, this year, new scenes of complete, uniform, and vigorous seedlings have appeared in crops. (Xinhua News Agency)

    内蒙古小麦成熟预计可比去年增产二成
    内蒙古自治区大部分农业区小麦已经成熟，丰收在望，各地农民正在紧张地进行收割。今年小麦一般生长茁壮，颗粒饱满。根据初步估计，全区小麦产量能超过计划产量百分之十，比去年增产二成。包头市郊区十一个农业生产合作社今年播种的一千多亩小麦，麦穗肥长，预计可增产六万多斤。
    目前，各地党政领导机关正积极领导麦收工作。自治区人民政府农牧部已派出两个工作组，到河套行政区和呼伦贝尔盟的重点旗县，帮助当地开展以互助合作组织为基础的麦收竞赛和选种工作。×××内蒙古自治区东部地区的高粱、谷子、玉米和大豆等农作物生长良好。有耕地一千多万亩的著名产粮区哲里木盟，夏锄工作已基本结束，高粱都已经打包吐穗，玉米正在结棒，谷子也已结粒，估计今年可在原计划产粮七十五万吨的基础上增产一成以上。
    今年，内蒙东部地区各族农民都重视改进农业耕作技术。夏锄前，农民学会使用铲趟机的技术，使国家贷给的铲趟机充分发挥了作用。哲里木盟的六个旗、县有一万六千三百多名生产委员和生产积极分子学习了拌种、防虫、间苗和使用新农具的技术，带动广大农民改进技术，因此，今年农作物出现苗全、苗匀和苗旺的新气象。　（新华社）
