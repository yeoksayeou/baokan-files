PLA Units Discuss Draft Constitution

The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has greatly inspired the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) to defend and build the motherland and liberate the ancestral territory of Taiwan. Various units are further engaging in in-depth discussions of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

At an air force airport on the coastal defense front, air force soldiers are both vigilantly guarding the skies of the motherland and enthusiastically engaging in discussions on the Draft Constitution. Pilot Jiang Kai has carefully read the Draft Constitution three times, recording his insights in a notebook each time. He said, "I joined the revolution to ensure that the people are masters of their own destiny and that everyone is free from exploitation and oppression. The Draft Constitution puts the people's long-held desires into writing, and I want to remember every word of it!" The air force soldiers also specifically discussed Article 20 of the Draft Constitution, expressing their determination to fight to safeguard the security of the motherland, the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, and to liberate Taiwan.

The various organs and units of the Tibet Military Region have also begun publicizing and discussing the Draft Constitution. The units of the Tibet Military Region stationed in various locations are paying attention to transcribing news from radio broadcasts nationwide regarding the discussion of the Draft Constitution, preparing to print them out as reference documents for the units to discuss the Draft Constitution. A certain unit of the Tibet Military Region recently convened a representative meeting of soldiers, where the representatives enthusiastically discussed the Draft Constitution and unanimously expressed their support. The soldiers of the "Iron Battalion" of a certain unit stationed on the southwestern border, even amidst their heavy guard duties, have also launched enthusiastic discussions. Miao ethnic soldier Luo Sichang said that before liberation, ethnic minorities never had political rights. There was an old saying, "Officials occupy the plains, the people occupy the slopes, the Miao are driven to the mountain hollows." Today, the Draft Constitution stipulates that all nationalities are equal, and I wholeheartedly support this people's Draft Constitution.

Cadres and soldiers stationed on the Pamir Plateau are also discussing the Draft Constitution on the high mountains and snow-capped ridges. These soldiers, who are stationed far from the mainland for many years, feel particularly close to the Draft Constitution. Second-Class Merit recipient Feng Guokun said during a discussion of the Draft Constitution: "I want to protect the working people's enjoyment of the various rights stipulated in the Draft Constitution, and vigilantly guard the borders of the motherland."

Cadres and soldiers of the Northwest Public Security Forces are actively purchasing books and newspapers related to the Draft Constitution, deeply studying each chapter. The broad ranks of cadres and soldiers have a preliminary understanding of the basic spirit and main contents of the Draft Constitution. The soldiers of the Public Security Forces stationed in Aksu County also conducted a general review of the implementation of ethnic policies, based on the provisions of Article 3 of the Draft Constitution. The soldiers said: We are stationed in ethnic minority areas and must be exemplary in implementing the Party and government's ethnic policies, serving the people of all ethnic groups wholeheartedly.

Cadres and soldiers of various units of the Northeast Military Region have been actively holding symposiums and discussions to launch discussions of the Draft Constitution. At a hero's symposium held by a certain air force unit, Third-Class Merit recipient Jing Zhaorong said: "I have read the Draft Constitution many times, and the more I read it, the happier I am. Especially when I read the provisions of the state guaranteeing citizens' enjoyment of various basic rights, I think of the beatings and suffering I endured as an apprentice for capitalists when I was young. Now the Draft Constitution stipulates that the enjoyment of various basic rights shall be guaranteed for citizens. This is the happiness of the working people."

Diver Wang Dongyuan of a certain railway engineering unit participating in the Han River Iron Bridge construction project said, "Our participation in the Han River Iron Bridge construction project is participation in the country's socialist construction, and I am determined to redouble my efforts." The cadres and soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, who set the highest pile-driving record in the Han River Iron Bridge construction project, also seriously discussed the Draft Constitution. Platoon Leader Lei Maozhou said, "I was particularly moved after discussing citizens' right to vote and the right of workers to receive material assistance after losing their ability to work."

Many cadres and soldiers recuperating in military hospitals are also enthusiastically reading the Draft Constitution. Soldier Qu Chunmo, who is recuperating in a certain military hospital, said, "Since reading the Draft Constitution, I have further recognized the great and glorious task of revolutionary soldiers. I will definitely take good care of my health and strive to liberate the ancestral territory of Taiwan."

While discussing the Draft Constitution, cadres and soldiers of various units of the People's Liberation Army also put forward many suggestions for amendments and additions. (Xinhua News Agency)

    解放军各部队讨论宪法草案
    中华人民共和国宪法草案极大地鼓舞了中国人民解放军广大干部、战士保卫和建设祖国、解放祖国领土台湾的斗争意志。各部队正进一步深入讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案。
　　在海防前线某空军机场的空军战士们一面紧张地警卫着祖国天空，一面热烈地展开宪法草案的讨论。飞行员姜凯已经把宪法草案细读了三遍，每一次都把自己的心得记在笔记本上。他说：“我参加革命就是为了要人民当家作主人，使大家都不受剥削、压迫。宪法草案把人民多年的愿望写下来了，我要一字一句地把它记在心里！”空军战士们还特别讨论了宪法草案第二十条，表示决心为保卫祖国的安全和领土主权的完整，为解放台湾而奋斗。
　　西藏军区各机关、部队也已开始宣传和讨论宪法草案。西藏军区驻各地的部队，都注意抄收广播电台广播的全国各地讨论宪法草案的消息，准备印出来作为部队讨论宪法草案的参考文件。西藏军区某部在不久前召开了军人代表大会，参加会议的代表热烈地讨论了宪法草案，并一致表示拥护。驻守在西南边疆的某部“钢铁营”的战士们，在繁重的警卫任务中，也展开了热烈的讨论。苗族战士罗四昌说，解放前，少数民族从来没有得到政治权利，有句老话说：“官占坪，民占坡，苗族赶到山窝窝。”今天宪法草案上规定了各民族一律平等，我衷心地拥护这部人民的宪法草案。
　　驻守在帕米尔高原上的干部、战士们，也在高山雪岭上讨论宪法草案。这些远离祖国内地长年驻守在高原上的战士，看到宪法草案感到特别亲切。二等功臣冯国坤在讨论宪法草案时说：“我要保护劳动人民享受宪法草案上规定的各种权利，警惕地守着祖国的边防。”

　　东北军区各部队的干部、战士纷纷举行座谈会、讨论会积极展开宪法草案的讨论。在空军某部举行的功臣座谈会上，三等功臣景朝荣说：“我已经把宪法草案看了好多遍啦，越看越高兴。特别是当我看了国家保证公民享受各种基本权利的规定时，就想起我小时给资本家当徒工挨的打、受的罪。现在宪法草案上规定了要保障公民享受各种基本权利，这是劳动人民的幸福。”
　　参加汉水铁桥修建工程的铁道兵某部潜水员王东源说：“我们参加汉水铁桥修建工程，就是参加国家的社会主义建设，我决心加倍努力工作。”在汉水铁桥修建工程中创打桩最高纪录的第四排的干部、战士，也认真地讨论了宪法草案。排长雷茂周说：“讨论了公民的选举权和劳动者丧失劳动能力后有获得物质帮助的权利后，我特别受感动。”
　　许多在军队医院中休养的干部、战士，也热心地阅读了宪法草案。在某军队医院中休养的战士瞿春模说：“自从阅读了宪法草案以后，更进一步认识到革命军人的任务的重大和光荣，我一定把身体养好，为解放祖国领土台湾而奋斗。”
