Dailing Forestry Area's Second Logging Yard

Successfully Tests Tractor Logging in Summer

The Second Logging Yard of the Dailing Forestry Area in Heilongjiang Province has successfully tested the use of tractors to replace animal power for logging in the summer.

In the past, tractors could only operate in winter and were completely unable to operate in summer. This was because tractors are very heavy, and in the summer, they would create deep ruts when they ran across the mountain. Not only could they not collect timber, but the tractors themselves had great difficulty moving. As a result, machinery and personnel were idle during seasons other than winter, and equipment utilization rates were very low. Starting in the second quarter of this year, the Second Logging Yard studied and tested the Soviet tractor summer logging method. This method mainly involves laying wooden plank roads on the mountain using fuelwood timber. Tractors then travel on the plank roads to collect timber, thus fundamentally solving the problem that tractors could not collect timber in the summer for several years.

The success of this experiment has transformed machinery and personnel who previously only worked for four months of the year into year-round producers, increasing equipment utilization rates and significantly reducing enterprise management costs. The management cost of seasonal logging averaged 91,118 yuan per cubic meter of timber, while the cost of year-round operation is only 57,686 yuan per cubic meter of timber.

    带岭林区第二伐木场
    试用拖拉机夏季集材成功
    黑龙江省带岭林区第二伐木场试用拖拉机在夏天代替畜力集材成功。
    过去拖拉机仅能冬季作业，根本不能夏季作业。因为拖拉机很重，夏天在山场一压就压了很深的大坑。不但不能集材，就是拖拉机本身运行也十分困难。因此机器和人员除了在冬季作业以外，其余季节只好闲着，设备运用率很低。从今年第二季度开始，在第二伐木场对苏联的拖拉机夏季集材方法进行了学习试验。这一方法主要是利用薪炭材在山地上铺设木板道，拖拉机在木板道上行驶集材，这样就根本解决了几年来拖拉机在夏天不能集材的问题。
    由于这一试验的成功，使每年只有四个多月作业时间的机器和人员，改变为常年生产，提高了设备运用率，企业管理成本也随着大大降低。季节性集材每一立方公尺木材的管理成本，平均为九万一千一百一十八元，常年作业每一立方公尺木材的成本只用五万七千六百八十六元。
