As the Jingjiang Dike safely weathered the fifth flood peak, the people of the Jianghan Plain have gained even greater confidence in their ability to defend against the flood. Below the Jingjiang Dike, in the vast fields, millions of people, driven by mutual aid and cooperative organizations, are weeding and cultivating rice and cotton, working diligently to exceed production targets for grain and cotton. On the flat and wide dike, an even more intense flood control battle is underway.

The more than 100,000 flood control troops stationed along the north and south banks of the Jingjiang River have been holding firm for more than a month under the continuous high water levels of the Yangtze River. During this month, they have fought day and night against floods and storms, successfully weathering five dangerous flood peaks. On one occasion, the water level of the Yangtze River at Shashi reached over 44.58 meters, the highest recorded in history. However, the Jingjiang Dike stands firm and secure. The dike section around Cao City District in Jiangling County is one of the key vulnerable sections of the Jingjiang Dike. It breached in 1931 and 1935, causing damage to the people of the Jianghan Plain. Now, it remains intact. However, the flood control battle here is more intense than ever. There is a flood control post every less than a kilometer. Young people, adults, women, and experienced elderly farmers are all participating in various flood control tasks. Some are patrolling, some are carrying soil, and some are engaged in rescue work. The reporter met several elderly farmers who were stationed at a post monitoring the flood. They have all lived under the Jingjiang Dike for a long time. They all said in unison: Before liberation, each farmer's household in Jiangling County had to pay at least 450 jin of grain for dike labor fees every year, but the Kuomintang reactionaries did not use it for dike repair. When the dike breached, the reactionary troops not only did not save people but also looted by boat under the cover of the flood. When the Jiang dike breached in 1931, Grandma Cai Xinxiu's son-in-law climbed to the upper floor because the water was rapid and shouted for help, but the Kuomintang troops snatched away his family's clothes and luggage. Now, with the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we have built the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, reinforced the Jingjiang Dike, and have countless good cadres leading us to repair the dike and carry out rescue work. In the words of these elderly farmers, there is full of confidence and strength.

Along the long dike line, the difficulties encountered by the flood control personnel are unimaginable, but difficulties are constantly overcome by people's strong will and heroic actions. During these days, gales and rainstorms accompanied them for most of the time; there was also water accumulation inside the dike, and it was difficult to obtain soil in many places. In order to raise and thicken the dike, they braved the wind and waves and risked their lives to load soil from afar by wooden boats. The people of Jianli County, in this situation, raised the dike by 8 to 100 centimeters, allowing the flood that exceeded the guaranteed water level by 4 to 100 centimeters to recede obediently. In defending the Jingjiang Dike and defending against the particularly large flood of the Yangtze River, many cadres and Communist Party members stood at the forefront of the struggle. On July 22, when a dangerous situation occurred in Qijia Yuan, Li Dahan, the Deputy County Head of Jiangling County, led the cadres to jump into the flood and used their bodies to block the torrent, buying time to plug the gap and protect the dike. The farmers along the dike also demonstrated a high degree of initiative in flood control in order to protect their beautiful life and the crops in the farmland. The laborers who carried out rescue work at Shimatou once used their bodies to block the huge waves, quickly turning the dangerous project of the Jingjiang Dike from danger to safety.

The people defending the Jingjiang Dike feel at all times that the people of the whole country are supporting them. Large quantities of flood control materials from Northeast, Southwest, Hubei, Beijing and other places are constantly transported to the dike line of the Jingjiang Dike. There are more than 700,000 sacks and straw bags alone. Now, piles and piles of soil, rocks, straw bags, and sacks are piled up on the Jingjiang Dike, further strengthening the belief that "We must overcome the flood and defend the Jingjiang Dike."

    坚持和洪水斗争的荆江大堤
    新华社记者　海波
    当荆江大堤安全渡过第五次洪峰的时候，江汉平原的人民更加增强了防御洪水的信心。荆江大堤下，一望无际的田野里，千百万人民正在互助合作组织的带动下，在田里锄草，培育稻禾、棉花，为超额增产粮食和棉花而紧张地劳动着。在平坦宽阔的大堤上，正在进行着一场更加剧烈的防汛战斗。
    防守在荆江南北两岸的十多万防汛大军，已经在长江持续的高水位下坚守了一个多月了。在这一个多月中，他们不分昼夜地和洪水、暴风雨搏斗，胜利地渡过了五次险恶的洪峰。其中一次沙市长江水位达到四四点五八公尺以上，这是历史上最高纪录。但是，荆江大堤安然屹立着。江陵县草市区一带的堤防，是荆江大堤的重要险段之一。一九三一年和一九三五年都曾溃口，使江汉平原的人民遭受损害。现在，它仍安然无恙。然而，就在这里，防汛战斗却比任何时候都紧张。不到一里路的地方就设有一个防汛哨。青年、壮年、妇女和有防汛经验的老年农民，都参加了和洪水斗争的各项工作。有的在巡逻，有的在挑土，有的在抢险。记者遇到几位正在守哨监视洪水的老年农民，他们都是久居在荆江大堤下的人。他们异口同声地说：解放前，江陵县每户农民每年至少要出四百五十斤粮食的堤工费，可是国民党反动派却没有用在修堤上。当大堤溃口时，反动派的军队不但不救人，还坐着船趁水打劫。一九三一年江堤溃口时，蔡新秀老婆婆的女婿因水急爬到楼上喊救命时，国民党的军队却把他家的衣服行李抢走。现在我们有了毛主席、共产党的领导，修建了荆江分洪工程，加固了荆江大堤，又有无数的好干部领着我们修堤抢险。在这些老年农民的话里，充满了信心和力量。
    在漫长的堤防线上，防汛人员所遇的很多困难是不可想像的，但困难不断地被人们坚强的意志和英勇的行动所克服。在这些日子里，狂风暴雨差不多大部分时间伴随着他们；堤内又有积水，很多地方取土困难。为了把堤防加高培厚，他们用木船冒着风浪危险到远处去装土。监利县的人民，就在这样情况下把大堤加高了八公寸到一公尺，使超过保证水位四公寸到一公尺左右的洪水，乖乖地下泄。在保卫荆江大堤，防御长江特别大的洪水中，许多干部、共产党员都站在斗争的最前列。七月二十二日祁家渊发生险情，江陵县副县长李大汉便率领干部跳到洪水中以身体挡住激流，争取时间堵住漏洞，保卫住大堤。大堤沿线的农民，为了保卫自己美好的生活，保卫住农田的庄稼，在防汛中也都发挥了高度积极性。石码头抢险的民工们，曾经用自己的身体挡住了巨浪，使荆江大堤的险工很快地转危为安。
    防守在荆江大堤上的人们，时刻都感到全国人民在支持他们。东北、西南、湖北和北京等地，不断有大批防汛器材运到荆江大堤的堤防线上。仅仅是麻袋和草包就有七十多万条。现在，荆江大堤上堆放着一堆又一堆的土块、石块、草包、麻袋，使人们进一步加强了这种信念：“我们一定要战胜洪水，守住荆江大堤。”
