The 1.5 million people of Wuhan have received a relatively adequate supply of daily necessities during the long and intense flood prevention efforts, and their lives are quite stable. Major necessities such as rice, flour, oil, salt, coal, meat, cloth, and general merchandise have been supplied adequately due to the city's sufficient original reserves and the state's planned allocation, and prices have remained stable.

The supply of non-staple foods such as vegetables, which had experienced temporary difficulties in a short period, has quickly returned to normal and prices have remained stable, thanks to the vigorous efforts of state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives to organize supplies. In late June, after some suburban areas were affected by the disaster and the supply of vegetables became difficult, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives immediately sent seventy or eighty cadres to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Sichuan, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and the Northeast to purchase supplies. All regions did their best to provide support, supplying Wuhan with large quantities of melons, eggplants, cabbage, dried vegetables, salted fish, and other non-staple foods. Relevant departments also organized the reproduction industry to produce large quantities of tofu, bean curd sheets, and bean sprouts to diversify the vegetable supply. Recently, about 800,000 to 900,000 jin of vegetables have been available in Wuhan every day, which is similar to the quantity before the flood prevention efforts, basically meeting the needs of the people's lives. At the same time, Wuhan's food factories have expanded the production of cooked food and cold food according to the needs of the flood prevention sites.

In order to supply the needs of the flood prevention personnel in a timely manner, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in Wuhan dispatched seven or eight hundred people to establish supply stations and mobile teams at the flood prevention sites, using carts, baskets, and shoulder poles to supply the food and daily necessities needed at each flood prevention site. The Wuhan Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce has also organized private merchants, allowing them to sell and purchase goods from state-owned commercial departments for distribution to the market, while also organizing some private merchants to transport goods directly from the production areas to the city for sale.

    武汉市人民的生活用品得到大量供应
    武汉市一百五十万人民在长期紧张防汛中，得到比较充分的生活资料的供应，生活相当安定。主要生活必需品，如米、面、油、盐、煤、肉类和布匹、日用百货等，因为市内原有储备充足和国家有计划地调拨，供应量都相当充分，价格一直没有波动。
    曾经在短时间内一度供应发生困难的蔬菜等副食品，由于国营商业部门和合作社大力组织货源也已经很快地恢复了正常供应，价格保持稳定。六月下旬，因部分郊区受灾，菜蔬供应发生困难以后，国营商业部门和合作社便立即派出七、八十名干部分赴上海、广州、四川、山西、内蒙古和东北等地进行采购。各地都尽一切可能加以支援，源源供应武汉大批瓜类、茄子、白菜和干菜，咸鱼等副食品。有关部门还组织复制业大量生产豆腐、豆皮和豆芽等，使菜食多样化。近来，武汉市每日上市的菜类约有八、九十万斤，和防汛前的数量相差不多，基本上满足了人民生活需要。同时，武汉市食品工厂根据防汛工地的需要，扩大了熟食品和冷食品的生产。
    为了及时供应防汛人员的需要，武汉市国营商业部门和合作社抽调七、八百人在防汛工地建立供应站和流动小组，用小车、篮子、挑担等，分区供应各防汛工地需要的食品和日用品。武汉市工商管理部门也将私商组织起来，让他们向国营商业部门经销、批购货物，供应市场，同时组织一部分私商从产地直接运货到市内销售。（本报武汉记者站）
