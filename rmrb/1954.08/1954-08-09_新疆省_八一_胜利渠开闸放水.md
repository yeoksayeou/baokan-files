The "August 1st" Victory Canal, built by a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region stationed in Aksu, participating in agricultural production, was completed in early July after three years and four months of work, and was officially opened on August 1st – the 27th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The main and branch canals of the "August 1st" Victory Canal are 257 kilometers long, extending from the south bank of the Aksu River to Shajingzi in the southwest. The canal is 27.4 meters wide, with excavation and filling amounting to more than 5.77 million cubic meters. 162 auxiliary structures were built on the canal. The irrigation area of this canal is 450,000 mu.

The opening ceremony was held at the Longkou water inlet gate, which was carved out of the cliffs of the Tianshan Mountains by the soldiers with their own hands. Attending the ceremony were Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, who was inspecting water conservancy construction projects in Xinjiang, Soviet water conservancy experts Volonin and Zhukov, Li Fudu, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Northwest Administrative Committee, as well as leading cadres and representatives from the CCP Central Committee Xinjiang Branch, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region, as well as the heroic troops who built the "August 1st" Victory Canal and Uyghur farmers from nearby villages.

At the meeting, Ren Chen, the head of a certain unit that built the "August 1st" Victory Canal, gave a report on the construction of the "August 1st" Victory Canal project for the purpose of building and prospering the border region. Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, delivered a speech at the meeting. He warmly congratulated the troops on their glorious victory in water conservancy construction. He said: It is not easy to build a canal in the border region of the motherland that can irrigate 450,000 mu of land. Transportation is inconvenient here, and materials are scarce. The heroic People's Liberation Army soldiers overcame the difficulties in the project with their own hands and built this canal. This spirit deserves praise and learning. Musa, a Uyghur farmer from Shajingzi Township, said on behalf of the farmers in the township: Before liberation, due to water shortage and flood disasters, our township with hundreds of households was reduced to only eighty households, and the area of cultivated land shrank year by year. Half of the families in the township lacked food. Since the People's Liberation Army came to Shajingzi, the troops have been repairing the old canals while building the "August 1st" Victory Canal, overcoming the difficulty of water use in the whole township. Now, our township has increased to 289 households, and the cultivated land area has expanded from 5,000 mu to more than 20,000 mu. This year, for the first time, we were spared from flood disasters, and the wheat yield per mu in the whole township can reach more than 300 jin. We must always unite with the People's Liberation Army and learn from the collective labor and advanced farming techniques of the People's Liberation Army. Soviet water conservancy expert Volonin also congratulated the troops who built the canal at the meeting. He said: After visiting the "August 1st" Victory Canal and the "August 1st" Victory Farm, I saw the barren land of the past now growing lush cotton and corn, and I also saw the farmers learning your agricultural production techniques. Your great achievements are worthy of our admiration.

The meeting passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

Afterwards, Yang Guanzhi, Deputy Director of the Production Management Department of the Xinjiang Military Region, cut the ribbon, and then the sluice gates were opened to release water. Snow water flowing down from the snow-capped mountains surged into Longkou and flowed into the canal. A burst of cheers rose from the dense crowd on the bank of the canal. The surging water then flowed into the fertile fields of the "August 1st" Victory Farm. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆省“八一”胜利渠开闸放水
    中国人民解放军新疆军区参加农业生产的部队驻阿克苏某部修建的“八一”胜利渠，历时三年零四个月，在七月上旬已经完工，并在八月一日——中国人民解放军建军二十七周年纪念日正式开闸放水。
    “八一”胜利渠的干支渠共长二百五十七公里，从阿克苏河南岸伸向西南沙井子；渠宽二十七点四公尺，挖、填土方工程达五百七十七万多立方公尺，在渠道上并修建了附属建筑物一百六十二座。这条水渠的灌溉面积有四十五万亩。
    开闸放水典礼是在战士们用双手劈开天山山崖凿出的龙口进水闸上举行的。参加典礼的有视察新疆水利建设工程的中央人民政府水利部部长傅作义，苏联水利专家沃洛宁、茹可夫，西北行政委员会水利局局长李赋都以及中共中央新疆分局、新疆省人民政府、中国人民解放军新疆军区等机关的领导干部和代表，还有修建“八一”胜利渠的英雄部队和附近乡村的维吾尔族农民。
    会上，修建“八一”胜利渠的某部首长任晨作了为建设边疆、繁荣边疆，修建“八一”胜利渠工程的报告。中央人民政府水利部部长傅作义在会上发表了讲话。他热烈地祝贺部队在水利建设方面的光辉胜利。他说：在祖国边疆建立一条可以灌溉四十五万亩土地的渠道是很不容易的。这里交通不便，材料也缺乏。英雄的人民解放军战士，用自己的双手克服了工程上的困难，修建了这条水渠，这种精神值得赞扬和学习。沙井子乡维吾尔族农民木沙，代表全乡农民在会上说：解放前，因为缺水和洪水灾害，我们几百户人的乡只剩下了八十多户，耕地面积一年年缩小，全乡一半人家缺粮。自从人民解放军到了沙井子，部队一面修“八一”胜利渠，一面帮助我们整修了旧渠，克服了全乡用水的困难。现在，我们乡又增加到了二百八十九户，耕地面积也由五千亩扩大到了两万多亩。今年第一次免受洪水灾害，全乡小麦每亩可收三百多斤。我们要和人民解放军部队永远团结在一起，学习解放军的集体劳动和先进的农作技术。苏联水利专家沃洛宁也在会上向修建水渠的部队道贺，他说：参观了“八一”胜利渠和“八一”胜利农场，看到了过去的荒野，现在长起了茂盛的棉花和苞谷，同时还看到了农民们在学习你们的农业生产技术，你们的伟大成就值得我们钦佩。
    大会通过了向毛主席、朱总司令致敬电文。
    随后，由新疆军区生产管理部副部长杨贯之剪彩，接着开闸放水。从雪山上流下的雪水汹涌地冲进了龙口，流进渠道。渠边密集的人群中腾起一片欢呼声。奔腾的水头，这时流入了“八一”胜利农场肥沃的田地。　（新华社）
