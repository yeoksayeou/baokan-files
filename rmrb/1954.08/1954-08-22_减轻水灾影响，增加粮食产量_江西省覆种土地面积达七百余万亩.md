    Reducing Flood Impact, Increasing Grain Production
    Jiangxi Province's Replanted Land Area Reaches Over Seven Million Mu

    As of early August, according to preliminary statistics from various regions in Jiangxi Province, the replanted area (including second-season late rice, regenerating rice, and miscellaneous grains) has reached over seven million mu.

    The enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for exceeding production quotas is exceptionally high. In the Hexi and other eight townships of the Ji'an Special District's Xingan County, under the slogan of "Cut one plot, plant one plot," over 13,700 mu of late soybeans have been rushed into the ground before the "Beginning of Autumn." To seize the opportune time and ensure the fulfillment of production increase plans, the masses of Dazhou Township in the Fourth District of the county are cutting rice during the day and turning the soil at night. In the First District of Shanggao County, more than 1,000 mu of rice fields were prepared for regenerating rice on August 5th alone. Under the call for increasing grain production, the broad masses of farmers in Linchuan County had already rushed to plant over 170,000 mu of late rice by August 5th.

    Farmers in the flood-affected areas along the river and lake are enthusiastically launching a production and disaster relief movement under the leadership and care of the Party and the People's Government. Farmers in Poyang County are actively draining water and removing water stains to save seedlings by adopting methods such as collective embankment, relay water hauling, building temporary water dikes for water hauling, and opening sluice gates for drainage. The Yingyang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative led more than one hundred laborers from the entire township to build an earthen dam five feet wide and four feet high for drainage, allowing some of the early rice fields to recover after drainage and are expected to be harvested. In the disaster-stricken areas of Yugan County where drainage is impossible, farmers, under the slogan of "Retreat the water to where you can plant," have selected high ground to nurture more than 600,000 jin of late rice seedlings. Areas where the water has begun to recede are now being rushed to transplant the seedlings. The Second and Seventh Districts of Poyang County, where the floodwaters are difficult to recede for the time being, have drawn a large number of people to carry out sideline production. Disaster-stricken farmers in Hukou County actively responded to the call from higher authorities to "reclaim two mu of wasteland per person and produce 130 jin of grain."

    减轻水灾影响，增加粮食产量
    江西省覆种土地面积达七百余万亩
    江西省各地到八月上旬止，据初步统计覆种面积（包括二季晚稻、再生稻、杂粮）已达七百余万亩。
    广大农民群众超额增产的情绪异常高涨。吉安专区新淦县河西等八个乡在“割一丘，种一丘”的口号下，“立秋”前已抢种下晚大豆一万三千七百余亩。为了抢火色保证完成增产计划，该县四区大州乡群众白天割禾，晚上翻田。上高县一区在八月五日一天内蓄留好再生稻一千多亩田；临川县广大农民在多增产粮食的号召下，至八月五日已抢种了晚稻十七万多亩。
    沿江滨湖水患地区农民，在党和人民政府的领导和关怀下，热烈地展开了生产救灾运动。鄱阳县农民采取集体圈壋后接力车水、筑临时水堤车水、开闸排水等方法，积极排涝去渍，抢救禾苗。莺鸯乡农业生产合作社带动全乡百余劳动力，作了一座五尺宽、四尺高的土坝排水，使部分早稻田在排水抢救后，生长转好，可望收获。余干县无法排水地区的受灾农民，在“水退到那里，就种到那里”的口号下，选择高地育好了六十多万斤种谷的晚稻秧苗；水开始下退地区，现正在抢栽。鄱阳县洪水一时难于下退的二、七区，已抽出了大批人力进行副业生产；湖口县受灾农民，积极响应了上级提出的
  “每人开荒二亩，生产一百三十斤粮食”的号召。
