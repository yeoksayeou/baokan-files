Many handicraft production cooperatives in Beijing have gradually developed into semi-mechanized production, and some have become mechanized factories, demonstrating the superiority of organized collective production. According to statistics at the end of June this year, 37 handicraft production cooperatives, including knitting, metal, cotton weaving, and clothing, have semi-mechanized or mechanized production processes. Among them, 46% developed into semi-mechanized or mechanized after being organized. The Beijing No. 2 Cotton Weaving Production Cooperative was formed in 1950 by 13 scattered unemployed weavers with only more than 400,000 yuan of shares. They rented five dilapidated houses, used rice pots as thread dyeing pots, and borrowed 30 bundles of yarn and five manual looms from the Seventh District Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing. Under the conditions of collective production, the cooperative members studied technology and wove high-quality and low-priced cloth. Now, it has developed into a cooperative of considerable scale: 147 members, 56 power looms, and 600 million yuan in capital.

The Municipal No. 1 Knitting Production Cooperative was organized in 1949 by 30 handicraft households with 30 knitting machines, and the product quality was poor. Now, the entire cooperative has 218 members, 274 hand-cranked machines, and 20 gas lamp, electric thread winding machines, capping machines, spin dryers, and mercerizing machines; the entire production process uses machines. Another example is the Municipal No. 1 Food Production Cooperative, which was formed in June 1950 by three unemployed workers with only 1.2 million yuan of capital. They used copper basins as sugar pots and stone slabs instead of sugar cooling boards. By 1953, the cooperative had purchased 11 machines such as cooling water tanks, sugar rolling machines, noodle pressing machines, and egg beaters, and also built double-decker ovens, developing from handicraft production to semi-mechanized production. The number of members has increased to 156. The Municipal Carved Ivory Production Cooperative was established in 1953 with 41 members; now, there are 56 members, and the prejudice that carving ivory must be done entirely by hand for thousands of years has been changed, and some production processes have used machines. The Municipal No. 2 Metal Production Cooperative had only 23 members and three lathes at the end of 1953. Now, it has a total of 10 lathes, punch presses, drilling machines, and presses, as well as two cupola furnaces.

These handicraft production cooperatives have played a great role in supporting national construction and supplying the needs of the people's lives. In the third quarter of this year, the Municipal No. 2 Cotton Weaving Production Cooperative will produce 7,800 pieces of high-quality cloth such as khaki and gabardine. In addition to supplying the dyeing and mercerizing of raw yarn needed by the city's 13 knitting production cooperatives every month, the Municipal No. 1 Knitting Production Cooperative also produces more than 4,000 dozens of long and short socks of 15 or 16 kinds such as phoenix tail and embroidery every month. The Municipal No. 1 Food Production Cooperative can now produce 22 kinds of candies and 26 kinds of bread, biscuits, and pastries. The monthly output of candies, biscuits, pastries, and bread is nearly 180,000 jin. The Municipal No. 2 Metal Production Cooperative will produce 400,000 jin of various pots and accessories for railways and trains worth more than 500 million yuan in the third quarter of this year.

With the development of cooperative production, the lives of the members have been appropriately improved. For example, many members of the Municipal No. 1 Food Production Cooperative could not even afford shoes when they first joined the cooperative, but now some have put on leather shoes, and some have even bought bicycles. Huo Zhisheng, a member of the Municipal No. 5 Cotton Weaving Production Cooperative, used to earn only an average of 200,000 yuan per month for food expenses when he worked individually with his younger brother and sister-in-law. After joining the cooperative, the three of them earned 1.5 million yuan per month.

    北京市许多手工业生产合作社改进生产
    北京市有很多手工业生产合作社，已逐步发展为半机械化生产，有的已成为机械化生产的工厂，显示了组织起来集体生产的优越性。据今年六月底统计，生产过程半机械化或机械化的已有针织、金属、棉织、服装等三十七个手工业生产合作社。其中有百分之四十六是组织起来后才发展为半机械化或机械化的。北京市第二棉织生产合作社是一九五○年由十三个分散的失业织布工人组成的，只有四十多万元股金。他们租了五间破屋，用饭锅做染线锅，又向北京市第七区工会借了三十捆纱和五台人力织布机。在集体生产的条件下，社员们研究技术，织出了质好价廉的布匹。现在，它已发展成为具有相当规模的合作社：社员一百四十七人、电力织布机五十六台，资金六亿元。
    市第一针织生产合作社一九四九年是三十户手工业者组织起来的，针织机三十台，产品质量低劣。现在，全社已有社员二百一十八人，手摇机二百七十四台，汽灯、电力打线机、挂尖机、甩干机、丝光机共二十台；全部生产过程都用机器。再如市第一食品生产合作社，它是一九五○年六月由三个失业工人组成的，只有一百二十万元资金。他们用铜脸盆做糖锅，用石板代替凉糖板。到一九五三年，该社就购买了凉水箱、轧糖机、压面机、打蛋机等十一台机器，还修建了双型烤炉，由手工业生产发展为半机械化生产。社员发展到一百五十六人。市雕刻象牙生产合作社成立于一九五三年，当时有社员四十一人；现在，已有社员五十六人，并改变了千百年来认为雕刻象牙完全要用手工的偏见，部分生产过程已使用机器。市第二金属生产合作社在一九五三年底只有二十三个社员，三台车床。现在已有车床、冲床、钻床、压力机共十台，化铁炉二座。
    这些手工业生产合作社在支援国家建设和供应人民生活需要上起了很大作用。今年第三季度，市第二棉织生产合作社将生产卡其、哈叽等上等布七千八百匹。市第一针织生产合作社每月除供应全市十三个针织生产合作社所需原纱的染色和丝光的加工原料外，每月还生产凤尾、挑花等十五、六种长短袜子四千多打。市第一食品生产合作社现在可出产糖果二十二种、各种面包、饼干、糕点二十六种。每月可产糖果、饼干、糕点、面包等近十八万斤。市第二金属生产合作社今年第三季度将生产各种锅四十万斤，以及价值五亿多元的铁路和火车上的配件。
    随着合作社生产的发展，社员的生活已有适当的提高。例如市第一食品生产合作社的很多社员，在刚入社时连鞋都买不起，现在有的已穿上了皮鞋，有的甚至还买了自行车。市第五棉织生产合作社社员霍志生过去和弟弟、弟媳妇三人单干时，除了伙食费平均每月只收入二十万元，入社后三个人每月收入达一百五十万元。
