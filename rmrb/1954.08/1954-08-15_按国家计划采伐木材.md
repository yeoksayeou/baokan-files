    Timber Harvesting According to National Plan
    The Donghou Township of Youxi County in Fujian Province has formulated a three-year timber production plan.
    Donghou Township has abundant forests. Since the abolition of felling approval procedures for forest farmers at the end of last year, the phenomenon of blind production quickly became serious. By May of this year, more than 600 cubic meters of timber had been accumulated, but the masses still demanded large-scale felling. After the working group of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry arrived in the township, they combined the formulation of a three-year afforestation plan with extensive education for forest farmers on the need for timber production to be carried out according to the national plan. After the education, the forest farmers understood the relationship between their own production and the national plan, realized that blind felling of timber in the past was wrong, and expressed that they would abide by the national plan in the future.
    After everyone realized the importance of the timber production plan, the working group, based on the specific conditions of the township and the needs of the country, determined the annual timber production tasks for the township for the next three years. Then, the township cadres studied and distributed the tasks to various villages, and then each village distributed the production figures to each mutual aid team based on specific conditions (giving appropriate consideration to individual farmers). Each team held a meeting of its members (and absorbed individual farmers) to discuss the assigned tasks. At the same time, they handled the contract signing procedures, registered the mountain names, specifications, and quantities of the timber to be felled, and selected a representative from each natural village to sign a contract with the state. After propaganda and education, everyone signed annual timber production contracts according to the national allocation figures. In total, the township will produce 4,848 cubic meters of timber in three years.
    After the establishment of the timber production plan, the timber production sentiment of forest farmers was greatly stabilized. Chen Rizhi's mutual aid team wanted to cut as much as possible when the plan was first drawn up and had over-ordered the timber production plan. Later, seeing that they could harvest every year, they took the initiative to reduce the harvesting plan, waiting for the timber to grow larger before selling it, and no longer eagerly demanding to cut timber.
    Through the establishment of the timber production plan, the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation was also improved. The original plan for the whole township was to afforest 1,745 mu in three years, but the total number of afforestation plans subscribed to by the masses was 2,206 mu, exceeding the plan by 461 mu.

    按国家计划采伐木材
    福建省尤溪县东后乡制订了三年木材生产计划。
    东后乡的林木很多，自去年底废除了对林农的采伐批准手续后，盲目生产的现象很快就严重起来，砍伐的木材到今年五月，已积存有六百多立方公尺，但群众还要求大量采伐。省农林厅工作组到该乡后，结合制订三年造林计划，对林农广泛地进行了木材生产需要按国家计划进行的教育，经教育后，林农认识了自己生产和国家计划的关系，知道了过去盲目砍伐木材是不对的，表示今后要服从国家计划。
    在大家认识了木材生产计划的重要后，工作组即根据该乡的具体情况和国家的需要，确定了该乡今后三年逐年的木材生产任务，然后由乡干部研究分配到各村，接着各村都根据具体情况，分配了各互助组的生产数字（适当照顾单干农民）。各组都召开组员会议（并吸收单干农民参加），对分配的任务进行讨论，同时结合办理订合同手续，登记砍伐木材的山名、规格、数量，并以自然村为单位，推选代表一人，和国家订立合同。经过宣传教育后，大家都按照国家分配数字和国家订立了逐年的木材生产合同。合计全乡三年共生产木材四千八百四十八立方公尺。
    木材生产计划订立后，大大的稳定了林农木材生产情绪。陈日桎互助组刚订计划时想尽量多砍，把木材生产计划多订了，以后看年年都可以采伐，就主动地把采伐计划减少，留待木材大了后再卖，不再急着要求采伐木材了。
    通过木材生产计划的订立，也提高了群众造林的情绪。全乡原计划三年造林一千七百四十五亩，但群众所订造林计划的数字合计为二千二百零六亩，超过了四百六十一亩。
