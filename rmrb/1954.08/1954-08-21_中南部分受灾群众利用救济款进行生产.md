The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has allocated over 160 billion yuan in relief funds to help people in some flood-affected areas of Central South China resume production and solve their livelihood difficulties. These relief funds have boosted the morale of the people in the disaster areas and supported the anti-disaster production campaign. In the dike areas of Hunan Province that were breached, the waterlogging has been mostly drained, and the breaches have been repaired. In some areas, crops have even been planted. For example, in the Bahu Dike area of Taoyuan County, 8,000 mu of sesame and millet have been planted after draining the waterlogging and repairing the breaches. In some areas of Hubei Province where waterlogging has not yet been drained, a sideline production campaign centered on mutual aid and cooperative organizations has been initially launched. For example, after the land of the Chen Changsong mutual aid group in Qianjiang County was flooded, they organized labor to drain waterlogging, reclaim wasteland, and engage in sideline production. Now, the income from sideline production alone is enough to cover daily living expenses. The Tang Xiyi mutual aid group in Zhangjia Township, Gong'an County, can save 100,000 yuan a day after engaging in sideline production, in addition to solving the livelihood difficulties of more than 150 people in the group. In Suiping, Xiangcheng and other places in Henan, most of the breaches have been repaired. The waterlogging in Xuchang and other places has also been basically drained. These areas are currently making every effort to replant crops.

With the development of the drainage and production campaign, mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the flood-affected areas have been further consolidated and developed. For example, the Puji District of Jiangling County, Hubei, originally had 231 mutual aid groups, but now it has developed to 406. Donggou Township in Echeng County originally had only 55 mutual aid groups, but now it has developed to 63.

    中南部分受灾群众利用救济款进行生产
    中央人民政府内务部为了帮助中南地区部分遭受水灾群众恢复生产和解决生活困难，前后拨给该区救济款一千六百多亿元。这些救济款鼓舞了灾区群众的情绪，支持了抗灾生产运动。湖南省溃漫堤垸地区已大都排出渍水和堵好决口，有的地区并种上了庄稼。如桃源县八湖垸排渍堵口后，已种了八千亩芝麻和粟子。湖北省部分渍水尚未排出地区，以互助合作组织为核心的副业生产运动已初步展开。如潜江县陈长松互助组土地被淹后，便组织劳动力分头进行排渍、开荒和副业生产，现在每天仅副业收入即可解决生活开支。公安县张家乡唐希义互助组进行副业生产后，除解决全组一百五十多人的生活困难外，每天尚可结余十万元。河南遂平、项城等地决口已大部堵复，许昌等地的渍水也基本排出，这些地区目前正在全力抢种。
    随着排涝生产运动的开展，水灾地区的互助合作组织都进一步巩固和发展。如湖北江陵县普济区原有互助组二百三十一个，现在已发展到四百零六个，鄂城县东沟乡原只有互助组五十五个，现已发展到六十三个。
