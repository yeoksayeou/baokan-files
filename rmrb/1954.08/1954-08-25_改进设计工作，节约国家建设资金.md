Improving the design work of industrial construction is of great significance for the rational use of funds and saving funds. Because after the construction policy is determined, design is the main factor determining the factory's construction funds. For example, selecting the factory site, determining the scope of land occupation and production operation methods, calculating the building area, machinery and equipment, and the number of personnel, considering the needs of various power facilities and the laying of industrial pipelines, these are all important links that affect investment. Backward and wasteful design will inevitably cause waste in construction and production. The funds that can be saved in design are often many times greater than the funds that can be saved in construction. Therefore, how to improve the quality of design as much as possible, use funds rationally, and save funds is an important political task for design workers. Now, based on our experience in designing several factories in the past, we will discuss three issues that have a greater impact on investment.

First, design norms and technical indicators must be correctly adopted during design. The adoption of advanced or backward norms and standards in design has an important relationship with the size of the investment amount. Errors in norms and standards often cause serious waste in design. For example, the product manufacturing man-hour quota is the most important factor affecting various construction indicators of a factory. For a machine manufacturing factory, if the labor hours for each product on the machine tool are increased by 100 hours, if the factory produces 1,500 machines per year, it will need to increase 150,000 man-hours per year. If the factory adopts a two-shift production system, it will need to add more than 40 machine tools, 800 square meters of production area, and more than 60 production workers. With the increase in the calculated number of workers, more than 1,000 square meters of dormitories will also need to be built. This will require an increase of approximately 8 billion yuan in investment. This does not include the power facilities (such as electricity, heat, etc.) and auxiliary production facilities (such as tool preparation, machine repair, etc.) that are increased due to the increase in equipment.

Some factory leaders have not seen the superior conditions of the newly designed factory in all aspects, have not studied the degree of mechanization of the new factory, have not recognized that the technical level and political awareness of workers will increase day by day in the future, and that labor productivity will inevitably increase day by day. They also do not study the backward conditions in technology and management of existing old factories, and blindly oppose the relatively advanced product man-hour quotas stipulated in the design. This conservative and backward tendency must be resolutely opposed. Because if the new factory is designed only according to the existing technical and management levels and the man-hour quotas that have been implemented, the country's industrial level cannot be improved. In this case, the leaders of industrial enterprises only need to follow the old methods of the past to lead production, and they can easily complete the task. In this way, they will become lazy and no longer actively study their business and strive to improve the level of the enterprise, and industrial production will suffer great losses. Therefore, the significance of adopting reasonable and advanced product man-hour quotas lies not only in saving a lot of funds, but also in stimulating production innovation and promoting industrial enterprise leaders to rely on the masses to strive to reach the quotas stipulated in the design. Of course, the man-hour quotas in the design cannot be drastically reduced regardless of the actual situation, so that the factory may not be able to complete the production tasks and cannot meet the country's quantity requirements for the product.

In addition to the product manufacturing man-hour quota, many design technical indicators must also be adopted in the design. When using each indicator, it is necessary to study its economic rationality. For example, when determining the dormitory area, many people hope to design the factory's dormitory to be larger and better, and require the average living area of each worker to be increased. But they did not consider that if each worker and his family only increased the living area by one square meter, a factory with 5,000 workers would need to increase the investment by nearly 10 billion yuan. When designing a factory, we once believed that the area of the new dormitory should be able to meet the living needs of all workers and their families in the factory. However, Soviet experts pointed out that the factory is very close to the city, and the families of some workers may work in other factories or institutions, and it should be estimated that they will live in the city. In this way, the originally determined building area can be saved by 20% to 40%.

For the design of office and living rooms in the factory building, appropriately improving the standard quota can also save a lot of funds. For example, the office area of four square meters per employee can be changed to three square meters. If it is considered that most employees spend more time going into the workshop than sitting in the office, it can be changed to 2.5 square meters per person, which can save a lot of building area.

In order to continuously reduce construction costs, Soviet basic construction agencies often study and compile new standard quotas. During the first five-year plan, they requested to reduce construction costs by 50%, of which improving design quotas to save funds played an important role.

Second, the factory area must be rationally arranged. The determination of the factory site and the specific layout of the factory area have a much greater impact on the investment amount than improving the design of a factory building or reducing several pieces of equipment. Because after the factory site is determined, the area development cost, the water and electricity supply methods, the scale of various sanitary facilities and pipeline laying, and the transportation of materials and products will all be determined. That is to say, the main content of the investment will be determined. Therefore, carefully comparing the factory site from various aspects is a very important task. Some comrades do not care much about the specific location of the factory site, and feel that building a factory there is also a factory. What they care about is how big the factory is and how many pieces of equipment there are. Under the influence of this kind of thinking, it is easy to cause serious waste. For example, building a factory in an area lacking raw materials, and the factory has to change or move as soon as it is built; or building a factory far away from the power and railway special lines, which increases the investment in supplying power and laying special lines. According to our understanding, this situation has occurred more than once. We have realized that in addition to technically guaranteeing the conditions for building a factory, it is also necessary to pay attention to a series of issues economically when determining the factory site. For example, the area development cost should not be large; the construction conditions should be good, and the foundation masonry cost of the building should not be much; it should have the possibility of production collaboration and public utilities collaboration, and be able to adapt to the city plan and the development plans of other neighboring enterprises in terms of water, electricity, power facilities and transportation; it does not need to build expensive protection facilities, such as earthquake-proof facilities, flood control dams, windbreak forests, etc. In short, when determining the factory site, it is necessary to study its possibilities technically and measure its value economically.

After the factory site is determined, the rationality of the internal layout of the factory area also has a great impact on the investment. In addition to considering the rationality of the production operation route, general master plan designers pay more attention to the aesthetic appearance of the external contour lines of the factory building, such as the roads should be wide, the green area should be large, the factory should have a wide front area and square, and blank areas should be reserved for the development of the factory in advance. Considering these principles is of course necessary. However, some designers often use this as an excuse to arrange the factory area very sparsely. Whether it is the main road or the secondary road, they require it to be wide. No matter what kind of factory it is, they mechanically reserve many blank areas for expansion. Due to the sparse and messy layout, too much open space and green area, the total area of the factory area is expanded, which not only wastes land, but also lengthens roads, walls, especially industrial pipeline facilities, and the investment is also increased. For example, for a factory with a building area of 60,000 square meters, if the land utilization coefficient is reduced from 25% to 15%, 160,000 square meters of land will be wasted. The water supply and drainage, gas pipelines, oil pipelines, cable pipelines and other more than ten kinds of industrial pipeline projects and road projects laid on this land will also be redundant. The waste caused by this blindly expanding the scope of the factory area is often counted in tens of billions of yuan.

The Soviet Union has revised the regulations on the spacing between factory buildings in the fire protection standards and the regulations on the isolation zone between the factory area and the dormitory area or the factory areas of two factories in the sanitary standards several times. After these regulations are revised, the factory area can be reduced as much as possible, and the land utilization coefficient can be greatly improved; and the dormitory area can be closer to the factory, so that water supply, power supply and heating facilities can be shared, and investment can be reduced. We should learn from these new standard quotas in the Soviet Union to improve our design work.

The unreasonable layout of the factory area, resulting in waste, is also manifested in the chaos of the production operation route. If the layout of the factory building is only for configuring it like a pattern on the general plan, that is a great mistake. When arranging the factory building, attention must be paid to the straightness of the roads, the flow line of production operations, and the workshops with close production connections should be densely arranged together. Otherwise, the transportation of finished products and semi-finished products in the future will be chaotic. To produce a finished product, it will have to go around the factory, wasting transportation tools and workers' labor, and the production cost will increase accordingly.

Third, eliminate the phenomenon of extravagance and waste in design, especially the phenomenon of extravagance and waste in the design of office and welfare buildings in factories. With the development of industry, in order to ensure the living, residential, cultural and entertainment needs of workers, many new dormitories and welfare buildings will be built. At present, worker villages, worker residential areas, and worker clubs have been built one after another near some cities. Inside the factory, in addition to industrial factory buildings, there are also administrative office buildings and office and welfare rooms attached to the sides of each factory building, which are indispensable auxiliary buildings in production. These buildings account for a considerable proportion of the total investment of the factory. For ordinary machine manufacturing factories, auxiliary buildings account for about 30% to 50%. Therefore, attention must be paid to saving funds in the design of these buildings.

Some factory leaders require excessive luxury for residential and welfare buildings; some designers believe that architectural art can only be expressed in civil buildings. They feel that civil buildings should be designed more carefully. Therefore, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste reflected in these office and welfare buildings is relatively common. This phenomenon of extravagance and waste is mainly manifested in the unreasonable allocation and use of welfare building area; blindly pursuing the aesthetic appearance and magnificence of the building form, and using excessive decoration and expensive building materials.

We have recently discovered many such situations. For example, the worker club project of a factory has a total building area of 5,130 square meters, but the area that can be actually used for worker entertainment is only more than 1,900 square meters. In addition to the stage and hall, there are dance halls, restaurants, billiard rooms, cold air machine rooms, etc., but there are no reading rooms, game rooms, libraries, etc. for public use. Workers reflected that "Besides watching movies, nothing else can be played." The interior and exterior of the club are decorated with gold and jade. There are cement sculptures, plaster reliefs and fired magnetic prefabricated products on the walls, a huge gold-plated seven-color oil painting, granite front door steps, marble-faced columns, and spring seats with leather cushions in the hall. This club exceeded the reported budget by tens of billions of yuan. For example, the worker canteen of another factory pursues the so-called classical style, with different patterns of doors and windows, which are about 25% more expensive than ordinary doors and windows. The roof ridge is also built into a classical five-ridge and six-beast style. There are many floral carvings on the large arched front door, and there are as many as nine kinds of paint colors. There are patterned decorations on the handrails and corridors, and even the ventilation holes have sculptures. These are all phenomena of extravagance and waste that should be criticized.

When dealing with the design of welfare buildings, we must abide by the basic principle of "gradually improving the material and cultural living standards of the people on the basis of ensuring the development of production." It is contrary to this principle to pay attention to magnificence and luxury in welfare buildings. Doing so will divert the country's construction funds and slow down the speed of industrial development. The final result will slow down or even fundamentally fail to improve the people's material and cultural living standards.

On the other hand, some designers believe that to eliminate the phenomenon of extravagance and waste in design means not to pay attention to architectural art, or at least it is difficult to pay attention to architectural art. This view is also wrong. We must equate improving the quality of architectural design with reducing construction costs. Many typical designs in the Soviet Union tell us that the beauty of architecture mainly does not rely on painting and decoration, those hypocritical formalism covers, and those rigidly copied "classical architecture" and "national forms". On the contrary, when excessive decoration is not coordinated with the entire building, it not only does not show the beauty of the building, but also creates a very disproportionate appearance, or even a distorted style. To do a good job in architectural design, designers must be familiar with the use of the building, be familiar with the general plan of the entire enterprise and dormitory area, and study the most appropriate matching ratio of each part of the building. Of course, it is permissible and necessary to install some simple and beautiful decorations in some major and prominent places, especially when various paints and decorations are consistent with the protective function of the structure. In short, every architectural designer must deeply understand how to save national funds, and use the least investment to create the most suitable, strongest and most beautiful buildings.

The above only talks about a few aspects. The principle of rational use of funds and saving funds should be implemented in every specific project and every design step. This principle should become the guideline that every design worker must follow when designing.

    改进设计工作，节约国家建设资金
    立之
    改善工业建设的设计工作，对合理运用资金和节约资金有着重要意义。因为在建设方针确定以后，设计是决定工厂建设资金的主要因素。例如选择工厂的厂址、确定占地的范围和生产作业方法、计算工厂的建筑面积、机器设备和人员数量，考虑各种动力设施的需要及工业管道的敷设等，这些都是影响投资的重要环节。设计的落后和浪费，必然造成施工和生产的浪费。在设计中所能节省的资金，往往要比施工中可以节省的资金大很多倍。因之，如何尽力提高设计质量，合理地使用资金和节约资金，乃是设计工作者的一项重要的政治任务。现在拟就我们过去设计几个工厂的体会，提出三个对投资影响较大的问题谈一谈。
    第一，设计时一定要正确地采用设计定额和技术指标。在设计中采用的定额标准先进或落后，对投资额的大小有重要的关系。由于定额标准的错误，常常造成设计中的严重浪费。例如产品的制造工时定额就是影响工厂各种建设指标的最重要的因素。一个机器制造厂，如果每个产品在机床上的劳动工时增加一百小时，这个工厂若是年产一千五百台机器，每年就需要增加十五万工时，工厂如果采用两班生产制，就需要增加四十多台机床，八百平方公尺的生产面积和六十多个生产工人，随着工人计算数量的增加，还要新建一千多平方公尺宿舍。这样一来，就需要增加约八十亿元的投资。这还不包括由于设备增加而增加的动力设施（如电力、热力等）和辅助生产设施（如工具准备、机器修理等）在内。
    有些工厂的领导同志，没有看到新设计的工厂各方面的优越条件，没有研究新工厂机械化的程度如何，没有认识到今后工人技术水平和政治觉悟将日益提高，劳动生产率必然日益增长，也不研究目前旧工厂在技术上管理上存在着那些落后状况，就盲目地反对设计中规定的比较先进的产品工时定额。这种保守落后的倾向必须坚决反对。因为如果新工厂只按照现有的技术水平管理水平及已推行过的工时定额来设计，国家的工业水平就不能提高。在这种情况下，工业企业的领导者们只须因循着过去的老一套的办法来领导生产，就可以轻易地完成任务。这样，他们就会懒惰起来，不再去积极地钻研业务和努力提高企业的水平，工业生产就要受到很大的损失。所以，采用合理的和先进的产品工时定额，其意义不仅仅在于能大量地节约资金，而且能刺激生产革新，推动工业企业的领导者们依靠群众努力争取达到设计中所规定的定额。当然，设计中的工时定额也不能不顾实际地大力缩减，以致造成工厂没有完成生产任务的可能，不能满足国家对该种产品的数量要求。
    除了产品制造工时定额以外，在设计中还要采用很多种设计技术指标。在利用每一种指标时，都需要研究其经济上的合理性。例如确定宿舍面积时，很多人都希望把工厂的宿舍设计得大一些，好一些，要求将每个工人的平均居住面积增大。但他们没有考虑到，假如每个工人及其家属只增多一平方公尺的居住面积，一个五千工人的工厂就要增加近百亿元的投资。在设计某工厂时，我们曾认为：新建宿舍面积应该能够满足该厂全部工人及家属的居住需要。但是，苏联专家提出：工厂离城市很近，一部分工人的家属可能在其他工厂或机关工作，应该估计到他们将在城市内居住。这样，原来所决定的建筑面积就可以节省百分之二十至四十。
    对于厂房内的办公和生活用室的设计，适当地改善标准定额，也能节省不少资金。例如可以将每个职员四平方公尺的办公面积改为三平方公尺，如果考虑到大部分职员深入车间的时间多，而不是经常坐在办公室里，更可以改为每人二点五平方公尺，这样就可以节省不少建筑面积。
    为了不断地降低建筑成本，苏联的基本建设机构经常研究和编制新的标准定额。他们在第一个五年计划内，曾要求将建筑成本降低百分之五十，其中由改善设计定额以节约资金占着重要的地位。
    第二，要合理地布置工厂厂区。厂址的确定和厂区的具体布置，比改进一幢厂房的设计，或者削减数台设备对投资额的影响要大得多。因为厂址确定后，地区的开拓费用、水电的供应方式、各种卫生设施和管线敷设的规模，材料及产品的运输等，都将确定。也就是说，投资的主要内容将予确定。因此慎重地从多方面比较厂址，是一项十分重要的工作。有些同志对于厂址的具体位置不大关心，觉得盖在那里也是工厂，他们所关心的只是工厂有多么大，设备有多少台。在这种思想支使之下，就容易造成严重的浪费。例如把工厂盖在缺乏原料的地区，工厂刚盖好，就得改行或者搬家；或者把工厂盖在离电力和铁路专用线很远的地方，使供给电力和敷设专用线的投资增大。据我们了解，这种情况已不只发生过一次。我们体会到，确定厂址除了要在技术上保证有建厂的条件外，还需要在经济上注意一系列的问题。例如地区开拓费用不能大；建筑条件要好，建筑物的基础砌置费用不多；具有生产协作和公用事业协作的可能，在水、电、动力设施及交通运输方面能与城市计划及其他邻近之企业发展计划相适应；不需要建筑价格高昂的防护设施，如防地震设施、防洪堤、防风林等等。总之，确定厂址时必须在技术上研究其可能，并在经济上衡量其价值。
    厂址确定以后，厂区内部布置的合理与否，对投资也有很大的影响。一般的总图设计者，除了考虑生产作业路线的合理外，多注意厂房外部轮廓线条的美观，如道路要宽阔，绿化地带面积要大，厂内要有宽大的厂前区及广场，要预先保留工厂的发展空隙地带等。考虑这些原则，当然是必要的。但常常有些设计者以此为理由，将厂区布置得很稀疏，无论是主要道路或次要道路，都要求宽阔，无论是什么性质的工厂，都机械地保留很多空白地带以备扩展。由于布置的稀疏凌乱，空地和绿化地太多，厂区总面积就扩大了，不但浪费了土地，而且使道路、围墙，特别是工业管道设施加长，投资也就增大。例如一个拥有六万平方公尺建筑占地面积的工厂，如果将土地利用系数由百分之二十五降低到百分之十五，就将浪费土地十六万平方公尺，在这块土地上敷设的上下水道、气体管道、油料管道、电缆管道等十余种工业管线工程和道路工程，也将是多余的，这种盲目扩大厂区范围造成的浪费，往往以数十亿元计。
    苏联曾数次修改防火标准中关于厂房间隔距离的规定，和卫生标准中关于厂区与宿舍区或两个工厂厂区之间的隔离地带的规定。这些规定经过修改后，可使厂区面积尽量减缩，土地利用系数大大提高；并使宿舍区可更靠近工厂，以便共用供水、供电及供热设施，减缩投资。我们应该学习苏联的这些新的定额标准，来改善我们的设计工作。
    厂区的布置不合理，以致造成浪费，还表现在生产作业路线的混乱方面。厂房的布置，如果只是为了在总平面图上配置得像一幅图案，那就是极大的错误。在布置厂房时，必须注意道路的直线性、生产作业的流水线路，并应将生产联系紧密的车间密集地布置在一起。否则将来生产上的成品和半成品的运输就会混乱，生产一件成品，要在厂内兜来兜去地转圈子，浪费了运输工具，也浪费了工人的劳动，生产成本就会因之提高。
    第三，要消灭设计中的铺张奢侈现象，特别是工厂的办公和福利建筑设计中的铺张奢侈现象。随着工业的发展，为要保证工人生活居住和文化娱乐需要，将新建很多宿舍和福利建筑。目前在一些城市附近，已经陆续地建筑了工人村，工人住宅区和工人俱乐部等。在工厂内部，除开工业性的厂房外，还有行政办公楼和附于各厂房侧面的办公和福利用室，这些都是生产中不可缺少的辅助建筑。这些建筑在工厂的总投资中占相当大的比重，普通的机器制造厂，辅助建筑约占百分之三十至五十。所以必须在这些建筑设计中注意节约资金。
    有些工厂的领导干部对于住宅和福利建筑要求过奢；有一些设计人员认为只有在民用建筑中才能表现建筑艺术，他们觉得民用建筑应该设计得讲究一些，因之反映在这些办公和福利建筑中的奢侈浪费现象是比较多的。这种奢侈浪费现象主要表现在福利建筑面积的分配和使用不合理；盲目追求建筑形式的美观和富丽堂皇，采用过多的装饰和价格昂贵的建筑材料等。
    我们最近就发现很多这种情况，例如某厂工人俱乐部工程，全部建筑面积五千一百三十平方公尺，但真正可供工人娱乐使用的面积仅一千九百余平方公尺，里面除了舞台与大厅之外，还有舞厅、餐厅、弹子房、冷风机室等，但是没有供大众使用的书报阅览室、游艺室、图书馆等。工人反映说：“除了看电影外，其他啥也玩不上。”俱乐部内外修饰得金碧辉煌。墙上有水泥雕塑、石膏浮雕和烧磁预制品，有巨幅的镶金七色油画，有花岗石的正门踏步，大理石贴面的柱子，大厅里全部是皮垫的弹簧座椅，这一幢俱乐部超过上报预算数十亿元。再譬如另一工厂的工人食堂，追求所谓古典型式，门窗花样各异，造价比普通门窗贵百分之二十五左右，屋脊也砌成古典式的五脊六兽，大圆拱正门上很多花雕，油漆色彩达九种之多，扶梯、走廊上均有花纹装饰，甚至通风洞上也有雕塑。这些都是应予批判的奢侈浪费现象。
    在处理福利建筑设计时，我们一定要遵守“在保证发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民物质和文化生活水平”这一基本原则。在福利建筑中讲究堂皇富丽和豪华，是与此原则相违背的。这样做，就分散了国家的建设资金，减缓了工业发展的速度，其最后结果就会减缓甚至根本谈不上人民物质和文化生活水平的提高。
    另一方面，有些设计者认为要消灭设计中的奢侈浪费现象，就是不要讲求建筑艺术，至少是难于讲求建筑艺术。这种观点也是不对的。我们要将提高建筑设计质量与降低建筑成本相提并论，苏联很多典型的设计告诉我们，建筑的美主要不是依靠粉刷、装饰，那些虚伪的形式主义的掩盖，和那些硬搬的“古典建筑”和“民族形式”。相反，过多的修饰与整个建筑配合不当时，不但显不出建筑的美，而且会造成极不相称的外貌，甚至是一种歪曲的样式。要做好建筑设计，设计者必须熟悉建筑物的使用情况，熟悉整个企业和宿舍区的总平面图，研究建筑物各部分最适当的配合比例。当然，在一些主要的突出地方，安装一些朴素而优美的装饰，这是允许的，而且是必要的，特别是各种粉刷和装饰能与结构的保护作用相吻合时，更是完全必要的。总之，任何一个建筑设计者都要深刻地懂得怎样节约国家资金，要用最少的投资，创造出最适用、最坚固而又美观的建筑物来。
    以上仅谈到几个方面，合理使用资金和节约资金的原则，应该贯彻在每一项具体工程中和每一个设计步骤中，这项原则应该成为每个设计工作者进行设计时必须依循的准绳。
