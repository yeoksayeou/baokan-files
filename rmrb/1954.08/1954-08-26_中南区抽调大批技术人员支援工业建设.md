To support national industrial construction, the Central-South provinces and cities had transferred 522 technicians by the beginning of August. It is expected that 553 will be completed by the end of August, including 91 engineers and 462 technicians. The technicians transferred this time have been carefully reviewed and selected at all levels in each province and city, so the quality is generally better. In accordance with the principle of "centralized use and key allocation," the vast majority of these transferred technicians have been assigned to major projects. Encouraged by the general task of the country's transition period, the transferees have been able to accept the assignments and embark on new jobs actively and happily.

    中南区抽调大批技术人员支援工业建设
    为了支援国家工业建设，中南各省市到八月上旬已抽调技术人员五百二十二名。预计到八月底可完成五百五十三名，其中工程师九十一名，技术员四百六十二名。此次抽调的技术人员，各省市都是经过逐级认真审查挑选的，因此质量一般比较好。这批上调技术人员已按照“集中使用，重点配备”的原则，绝大部分分配到重大工程。被调人员在国家过渡时期总任务的鼓舞下，都能服从分配，积极愉快地走上了新的工作岗位。
