Following the opening of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area for flood storage, migrants from within the diversion area have been properly resettled. After the migrants arrived in safe areas, the People's Government immediately distributed over 3 billion yuan in relief funds to alleviate the living difficulties of some migrants. Now, the government is actively planning to distribute hundreds of billions of yuan in flood storage subsidies to provide assistance to each migrant household in terms of production and living. In order to ensure the grain supply in safe areas, the People's Government has transported large quantities of grain from Chongqing, Yichang, and other places and distributed rations for one month to half a year per person, based on the actual situation. Due to the high population density in the safe areas, the People's Government is actively strengthening sanitation work, newly establishing twenty health stations and five mobile medical teams, providing free medical care. With the assistance of local People's Governments, the migrants' more than 20,000 head of draught cattle have been sent to neighboring counties for centralized feeding, with veterinarians assigned to care for them. The people of the Flood Diversion Area have repeatedly expressed their gratitude for the meticulous care shown by the People's Government. (Hubei Special Dispatch from this newspaper)

    荆江分洪区移民已妥善安居
    荆江分洪区开闸蓄洪后，分洪区内移民已得到妥善安置。移民到达安全区后，人民政府即发放救济款三十余亿元，解决了一部分移民的生活困难。现在政府又积极筹划发放蓄洪补助费数百亿元，使每户移民在生产上和生活上得到补助。人民政府为了保证安全区的粮食供应，已从重庆、宜昌等地调运到大批粮食并根据实际情况发给每人一月到半年的口粮。由于安全区人口居住较稠密，人民政府积极加强卫生工作，新设立了二十个卫生站和五个巡回医疗队，实行免费医疗。移民的二万余头耕牛，在当地人民政府协助下，已有组织地送到邻县集中饲养，并配备兽医照顾。分洪区人民对于人民政府无微不至的关怀，一再表示感谢。（本报湖北专电）
