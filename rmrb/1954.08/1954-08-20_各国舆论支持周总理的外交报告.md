	International Public Opinion Supports Premier Zhou’s Diplomatic Report
	Poland
	"People's Tribune" published an article by political commentator Zygmunt Broniarek, titled "Taiwan—A Hotbed of Conspiracy and Provocation." The article stated: The American imperialists' aggression against Taiwan "is the most illegal and barbaric act of aggression against the People's China, and also a serious threat to world peace. Under the rule of the United States and the Kuomintang, Taiwan has become one of the most rampant areas for international provocation. The activities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang since the end of the Geneva Conference on Indochina ceasefire prove this. The barbaric attacks by American aircraft on Chinese aircraft and the downing of two fighter planes of the People's Air Force immediately after the conference was no coincidence. Therefore, Premier Zhou Enlai's report at the meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on August 11 was fully justified when he said, 'In order to further ease international tensions... the People's Republic of China must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.'"
	The article said: "World public opinion hopes to ease international tensions. They are watching with admiration the Chinese people's struggle to consolidate peace. Even many bourgeois leaders are increasingly aware of the tremendous changes taking place in China and the significance of these changes for the cause of peace. The visit of the British Labour Party delegation to China is proof of this. There is no doubt that all honest people around the world now support and will continue to support the struggle of the People's China to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and liberate Taiwan—this hotbed of American conspiracies and provocations."
	"Warsaw Life" published an article entitled "The Voice of a Nation of 600 Million People," commenting on Premier Zhou Enlai's recent diplomatic report: "When Premier Zhou Enlai spoke about the Far East issue, he emphasized the great necessity of resolving the Taiwan issue. Because the island of Taiwan is an inseparable part of China, it must be returned to China. This issue is particularly urgent because, after the failure of the American imperialists' plan to expand the Indochina war, they have turned Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang entrenched there into the main center for subversive and provocative activities against the People's China. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, under the protection of the American navy and air force, is launching various aggressive provocations against the Chinese mainland from Taiwan. The base for Chiang Kai-shek's ships that carry out pirate attacks on foreign merchant ships is in Taiwan. To support the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the new American budget has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars. In particular, Chiang Kai-shek's recent provocative actions and the official participation of American ships and aircraft in these actions, as well as the news about the United States and Chiang Kai-shek concluding a so-called 'bilateral joint security treaty,' all affirm the danger of allowing this hotbed of war to exist in Asia."
	The article said: "Premier Zhou Enlai's report has made the planners of Far East provocations uneasy. This report reminds them that the People's China has become a powerful factor in the international arena, forming a new balance of power. It is a consistent fighter for peaceful cooperation between sovereign states, a great nation with 600 million people. It stands alongside the Soviet Union at the forefront of the forces determined to defend peace."
	Czechoslovakia
	The Czechoslovakian "Red Right Newspaper" commented on the 18th on the recent diplomatic report of Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, stating that Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report is a major international event. It will undoubtedly have a great impact on the future resolution of world problems, especially Far East problems. It will attract great attention in the Far East because it once again emphasizes the inviolable right of Asian countries to strive for freedom and sovereignty and to resolve their internal affairs themselves. After emphasizing that the liberation of Taiwan is China's own internal affair, the "Red Right Newspaper" said: "The demand to return Taiwan to the Chinese people is fully supported by all peace-loving people around the world, who hope to eliminate this stronghold of military aggression against China and consolidate peace in the Far East and the world."
	Romania
	Romanian newspapers widely commented on the diplomatic report of Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, on August 11.
	"Free Romania" published a commentary on the 18th entitled "The Chinese People Demand the Liberation of Taiwan," saying: "Zhou Enlai's report, as expected, has aroused great interest around the world. Peace-loving people believe that the liberation of Taiwan means eliminating a hotbed of aggression and eliminating a blatant and illegal act against the Chinese people." The commentary said that the American aggressive clique's policy towards Taiwan is increasingly unsupported, and their policy cannot stop the great Chinese people from uniting to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and consolidate peace in Asia and the world.
	"Labor News" published a commentary on the same day entitled "The United States' Policy of Aggression Against the People's Republic of China Is Doomed to Failure," saying: The American government's policy of aggression and provocation against China completely violates the most basic provisions of international law and moral principles, exposing the American rulers as bloody aggressors and colonialists. The United States is vainly attempting to turn back the wheels of history and implement colonial rule in Asia and the world. This reactionary policy is not only unacceptable to the Chinese people, but also violates the interests of all Asian countries and other countries in the world, including the United States. This is why this policy will meet with new failures.

### 各国舆论支持周总理的外交报告

    各国舆论支持周总理的外交报告
    波兰
    “人民论坛报”刊载了政论家泽格蒙特·布朗尼亚雷克的一篇文章，题目是“台湾——阴谋和挑衅的温床”。文章说：美帝国主义者对台湾的侵略，“是对人民中国的最非法的和野蛮的侵略行为，同时也是对世界和平的严重的威胁。在美国和国民党的统治下，台湾已成为国际挑衅行动的最猖獗的地区之一。蒋介石匪帮自达成印度支那停战的日内瓦会议结束以来所进行的活动可以证明这一点。美国飞机野蛮地攻击中国飞机。击落人民空军的两架战斗机的事件发生在会议刚刚结束之后，并不是偶然的。因此，周恩来总理八月十一日在中央人民政府委员会的会议上所作的报告是完全有理由的，他说，‘为了进一步和缓国际紧张局势……中华人民共和国必须解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。’”
    文章说：“世界舆论都希望缓和国际紧张局势。它们怀着钦佩的心情注意着中国人民巩固和平的斗争。甚至许多资产阶级的领袖都越来越清楚地认识到中国国内所起的巨大变化和这些变化对和平事业的意义。英国工党代表团这次到中国去访问可以证明这一点。毫无疑问，全世界一切正直的人民现在支持、将来也要继续支持人民中国消灭蒋介石匪帮、解放台湾——这个美国策划阴谋和进行挑衅行动的温床的斗争。”
    “华沙生活报”刊载一篇题为“六万万人民的国家的发言”的文章，评论周恩来总理最近的外交报告说：“周恩来总理在谈到远东问题时，强调指出了解决台湾问题的极大的必要性。因为台湾岛是中国的不可分割的一部分，所以必须把台湾交还给中国。特别是因为美帝国主义者在扩大印度支那战争的计划失败以后，已把台湾以及盘据台湾的蒋介石匪帮作为对人民中国进行颠覆和挑衅活动的主要中心，所以这个问题更具有迫切的意义。蒋介石匪帮正在美国海军和空军的庇护下从台湾向中国大陆发动各种侵略性的挑衅行动。对外国商船进行海盗袭击的蒋介石的舰艇的基地就在台湾。为了支持蒋介石匪帮，美国新预算又拨出了数亿美元的款项。尤其是蒋介石最近采取的挑衅行动和美国舰艇和飞机的正式参加这种行动，以及关于美国和蒋介石缔结所谓‘共同安全双边条约’的消息，都肯定地说明了让这个战争温床在亚洲存在的危险性。”
    文章说：“周恩来总理的报告已经使远东挑衅行动的策划者们感到不安。这个报告提醒他们，人民中国已经成为国际舞台上形成新的力量对比的强有力的因素，它是一个一贯主张各主权国家间的和平合作的战士，一个拥有六万万人民的伟大国家。它和苏联一起站在决心保卫和平的力量的前列。”
    捷克斯洛伐克
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”十八日评中华人民共和国周恩来总理兼外交部部长最近的外交报告说，周恩来的外交报告是一件重大的国际事件。它在以后解决世界问题，特别是远东问题时无疑将发生很大的影响。它将引起远东极大的注意，因为它再一次强调指出了亚洲各国人民争取自由和主权、争取由他们自己解决他们的内政的不可侵犯的权利。“红色权利报”在强调指出解放台湾是中国自己的内政后说：“把台湾交还给中国人民的要求是得到全世界所有爱好和平的人民的全力支持的，他们都希望消灭这个对中国进行军事侵略的据点，并巩固远东和世界的和平。”
      罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚报纸广泛评论中华人民共和国周恩来总理兼外交部部长八月十一日的外交报告。
    “自由罗马尼亚报”十八日以“中国人民要求解放台湾”为题发表评论说：“周恩来的报告，如所预料的那样，引起了全世界很大的兴趣。爱好和平的人民都认为解放台湾就是消灭一个侵略的温床，消灭对中国人民的明目张胆的非法行为。”评论说，美国侵略集团对台湾的政策越来越得不到支持，他们的政策阻止不了伟大的中国人民一致起来消灭蒋介石匪帮，巩固亚洲和世界的和平。
    “劳动报”在同一天以“美国对中华人民共和国的侵略政策是注定要失败的”为题发表评论说：美国政府对中国的侵略和挑衅政策完全违反了国际公法和道义原则的最起码的规定，暴露了美国统治者是血腥的侵略者和殖民主义者。美国正在枉费心机地企图倒转历史的车轮，在亚洲和全世界实行殖民统治。这种反动政策不仅不能为中国人民所接受，而且是违反所有的亚洲国家和包括美国在内的世界其他国家的利益的。这就是这种政策将遭到新的失败的原因。
