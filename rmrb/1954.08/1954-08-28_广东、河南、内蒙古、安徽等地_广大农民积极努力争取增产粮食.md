The instruction issued by the South China Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 12 to strive for over-fulfillment of agricultural production increase was enthusiastically supported by farmers throughout Guangdong Province. After mobilizing the masses to tap potential and find key points for increasing production, various places have revised their production increase plans. The revised production increase plans of 1,003 agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province generally exceeded the 12% increase target set by the South China Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for this year. According to statistics from 52 agricultural production cooperatives in Zhongshan County, the lowest production increase target reached 15%, while the highest reached 60%. Now the late rice transplanting work in the province has been successfully completed. In order to ensure full seedlings, farmers in various places generally carried out seedling inspection and replenishment work five to ten days after transplanting. The seedling replenishment work in the Yuebei District was basically completed around August 20. Now the late rice seedlings in various places have gradually turned green, and farmers are starting the first intertillage, weeding, and topdressing work. In the Hainan Island Qiongshan County Benli Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, where the season is earlier, the 737 mu of late rice fields have undergone two intertillage and weeding operations. Now, in order to strive for 18 jin more grain per mu than originally planned, they have started the third weeding and are applying 5-6 dan of local miscellaneous fertilizer. In order to solve the fertilizer source, the cooperative organized three fertilizer accumulation teams, which accumulated more than 5,000 jin of plant ash in two days. At present, some areas are experiencing drought and insect pests, and farmers in these areas are combining intertillage and weeding to carry out insect control and drought resistance to protect seedlings. According to statistics from seven districts in Zengcheng County, more than 8,000 people are mobilized every day to carry water and drain water for rescue; according to statistics from 17 districts in Qingyuan County, as of the 18th of this month, 2,785 water conservancy projects of various types have been repaired and newly built, benefiting an area of more than 290,000 mu. In order to increase the yield of miscellaneous grains, farmers in various places are using cultivatable open spaces and harvested peanut and jute land to expand the area of autumn crops. Farmers in the Yuezhong District are currently working hard to expand the area of autumn sweet potatoes by more than 210,000 mu, and are trying to use mulberry and banana fields to intercrop soybeans, broad beans, sesame and other crops.

    The movement to strive for over-fulfillment of agricultural production increase plans has been widely launched among farmers in Henan Province. At a meeting of 188 township cadres and team and cooperative leaders in Xinzheng County, by checking crops, calculating time, and finding methods, the county's tens of thousands of mu of corn can increase production by more than one million jin, reversing the conservative idea that "it is too late in the season to increase production." After selling a large amount of surplus grain to the state, 31 agricultural production cooperatives in Xuchang County held meetings of cooperative members to study key points for increasing production. Members of the Mingxing Cooperative propped up the lodged millet in the cooperative, did a good job in preventing wind, waterlogging, and insects, and carefully harvested and threshed, which can increase income by 20 jin per mu. At the same time, the cooperative used the money from selling surplus grain to buy 1,800 jin of fertilizer powder and 1,700 jin of sesame cakes, and applied them to the fields. In addition, they also planted 13 mu of buckwheat and 6 mu of vegetables in the sun-dried land. The Fourth District of Anyang organized more than 500 representatives of cooperatives, teams, and individual farmers to visit and learn from the Guo Wangdu Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative to promote the patriotic production increase movement in the entire district. Xinyang, Shangcheng and other counties advocated cultivating regenerating rice, which can increase production by 30 jin to 100 jin per mu. Xinyang County cultivated 250,000 mu of regenerating rice, which will increase grain production by 13 million jin. In addition, the investigation of open spaces for multiple planting and harvesting has also formed a movement in various places. Anyang County found more than 1,000 mu of open space in 92 villages in eight districts and planted late autumn crops and vegetables. (Our Henan Reporter Station)

    The wheat in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been harvested, and crops such as sorghum, naked oats, and corn are growing well. A bumper harvest is expected throughout the region. The Inner Mongolia Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government issued urgent instructions in the first half of August, requiring all localities to increase production by another 2% to 3% on the basis of the original plan to increase production by 10%, that is, to increase grain production by an average of 3 jin to 4 jin per mu, in order to further improve the living standards of the people in the region, support disaster areas, and support the country's socialist industrialization. The instructions also required the establishment of 6,000 agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest, with the number of farmers joining the cooperatives accounting for 10% of the total number of farmers. In order to better implement this instruction, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government and the Sub-bureau transferred more than 40 cadres from various directly affiliated agencies to the main grain-producing areas and pastoral areas with more livestock to help with their work. Various banners and counties held mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings in August and held mutual aid and cooperation training courses to study issues such as increasing production and establishing cooperatives.

    In order to overcome the losses caused by water and flood disasters, Anhui is vigorously carrying out a movement to increase grain production.
    In the previous period, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government comprehensively studied the situation in the province and decided to increase grain production by 3 billion jin based on the three different types of areas: severely affected, lightly affected, and non-affected, through drainage and replanting after water recedes, strengthening field management to strive for more harvests, cultivating regenerating rice, intercropping and relay planting late autumn crops, reclaiming wasteland and open space, and using leisure land to expand planting area.
    In order to ensure the correct implementation and execution of the above-mentioned measures, the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government successively led a large number of cadres to the disaster-stricken and non-disaster-stricken areas to inspect and help carry out production and disaster relief work. Party and government leading organs in various places also took mutual aid and cooperation as the center, vigorously mobilized the masses to implement these measures, and according to statistics as of the 21st of this month: more than 10.6 million mu of late autumn crops have been drained and replanted, more than 3.6 million mu of cultivated land have been expanded, and more than 3.7 million mu have been relay planted. Farmers in various places have also come up with a variety of intercropping and relay planting methods, such as intercropping corn and broad beans, intercropping carrots and buckwheat, relay planting broad beans on sweet potato ridges, and relay planting mud beans in regenerating rice fields, which expanded the planting area. According to statistics from the Lu'an Special District alone, the planting area expanded by intercropping and relay planting methods reached more than 459,000 mu.

    广大农民积极努力争取增产粮食
    中共中央华南分局在八月十二日发布的争取农业超额增产的指示，受到广东全省农民热烈拥护。各地经过发动群众挖潜力、找增产关键，纷纷修订增产计划，全省一千零三个农业生产合作社经修订后的增产计划，普遍超过了中共中央华南分局所提出的今年增产百分之十二的指标。据中山县五十二个农业生产合作社统计，增产指标最低的达百分之十五，最高的则达百分之六十。现在全省晚稻插秧工作已胜利结束，为了保证全苗，各地农民在插秧后五天到十天普遍进行了一次查苗补苗工作。粤北区于八月二十日前后已基本结束补苗工作。现在各地晚稻禾苗已陆续回青，农民正开始第一次中耕除草追肥工作。季节较早的海南岛琼山县本立村农业生产合作社的七百三十七亩晚稻田已进行过两次中耕除草，现在为争取每亩比原计划多打十八斤粮食，又开始除第三次草，并再追上土杂肥五、六担。为了解决肥源，该社组织三个积肥队，两天内就积草木灰五千多斤。目前部分地区又呈现旱象和虫害，这些地区的农民正结合中耕除草开展除虫、抗旱保苗斗争。据增城县七个区统计，每天都出动八千多人车水戽水抢救；清远县十七个区统计，到本月十八日止，已修好和新建各种水利工程二千七百八十五宗，受益面积达二十九万多亩。为了增加杂粮产量，各地农民正利用可以耕种的空地和已收了的花生、黄麻地以扩大秋植作物面积，粤中区农民目前正为扩大二十一万多亩秋植甘薯面积而努力，并尽量利用桑地、蕉地以间作黄豆、?豆、芝麻等作物。　（本报广东记者站）

    安徽各地为了战胜水、涝灾害所造成的损失，正蓬勃开展大量增产粮食的运动。
    中共安徽省委和省人民政府在前一时期，通盘研究了全省情况，决定根据重灾、轻灾、非灾三类不同地区，通过排水及退水补种、加强田禾管理争取多收，培养再生稻、间种套种晚秋、开垦荒地空地及利用休闲地以扩大种植面积等增产措施，增产粮食三十亿斤。
    为了保证上述各项措施的正确贯彻与执行，省委和省府各负责同志都先后带领大批干部连续分赴受灾地区与非灾地区，检查和帮助开展生产救灾工作。各地党、政领导机关也以互助合作为中心，大力发动群众贯彻了这些措施，至本月二十一日统计：已排水补种晚秋一千零六十余万亩，扩大了耕地面积三百六十余万亩，套种了三百七十余万亩。各地农民并想出了多种多样的间种套种办法，如把玉米和?豆间种，胡萝卜和荞麦间种，在红芋垄上套种?豆，在再生稻田套种泥豆等，扩大了种植面积，仅六安专区统计，以间种、套种办法扩大种植面积就达四十五万九千余亩。
