    Battle in the Darkness
    On July 26th, after a whole day of heavy wind and rain, the Hanyang Sleeper Preservation Plant was surrounded by floods on two sides. As night fell, the wind was still blowing, the rain was still falling, and the floodwaters were still rising. At this time, four dangerous situations were discovered. After the command post received a call about dangerous situations at the Sleeper Preservation Plant, it immediately mobilized rescue teams and rushed to the rescue.

    The People's Liberation Army soldiers who formed the Fifth Company of the rescue team were resting after a day of intense fighting. Upon receiving the rescue order, they immediately grabbed their tools and rushed to the Sleeper Preservation Plant. The task assigned to them was the most dangerous of the four dangerous spots. Although the rain was pouring down, the wind was howling, and the floodwaters were roaring, the soldiers plunged into the rescue battle, regardless of everything. The soldiers said: "No matter how strong the wind or how heavy the rain, it can't be stronger than our determination," "No matter how big the flood, we will definitely control the danger!" After midnight, the high-voltage power line malfunctioned, the electricity stopped, the lights went out, and the surrounding area was plunged into darkness. The roar of the flood seemed even more menacing. Company Instructor Liu Xingrang encouraged everyone, saying: "The electricity is out, but the floodwaters haven't stopped rising. Can our rescue efforts stop?" These words immediately reignited the soldiers' determination to fight the flood to the end. All that was heard were the soldiers resolutely replying: "No! We will never retreat until the mission is completed!" So everyone worked in the dark! Falling down, getting up; working continuously until dawn, and then until noon on the 27th, they finally completed the rescue mission and protected the embankment. (Mao Dan)

    黑夜中的战斗
    七月二十六日，经过整天的狂风大雨，汉阳枕木防腐厂两面被洪水包围了。入夜，风还在刮，雨还在下，洪水还在上涨，这时发现了四处险象，指挥部接到枕木防腐厂发生险象的电话后，立即调集抢险队伍，赶往抢险。
    组成抢险大队第五中队的解放军战士们，在一天的紧张战斗以后正在休息，一接到抢险命令，马上拿起工具向枕木防腐厂赶去。分配给他们的任务是四个险象中最险的一个地方。虽然雨在哗哗地下，风在呼呼地吹，洪水在轰鸣，但是战士们不顾一切投入了抢险的战斗。战士们说：“风再大，雨再大，都没有我们的决心大”，“不管洪水多大，一定把险抢住！”半夜以后，高压电线出了毛病，电停了，电灯灭了，周围陷入一片漆黑，洪水的怒吼似乎显得更加厉害了。中队指导员刘兴让鼓动大家说：“电是停了，但是，洪水的上涨没有停，我们的抢险能停吗？”这几句话一下又鼓起了战士们与洪水搏斗到底的决心，只听得战士们坚决地回答：“不能！不完成任务决不收兵！”于是大家就摸黑干起来了！跌倒了，爬起来；一直干到天亮，又一直干到二十七日中午，终于完成了抢险任务，保住了堤防。　（毛丹）
