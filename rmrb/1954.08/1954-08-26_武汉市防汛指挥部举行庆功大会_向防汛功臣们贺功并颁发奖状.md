Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 24th: The Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters solemnly held a celebration rally on the 22nd and 23rd to celebrate the great victory in the previous stage of flood control in Wuhan, congratulate the flood control heroes, and award certificates. The conference also laid out the future direction and tasks of flood control work, and put forward the slogan of finally defeating the flood.

More than a thousand people participated in the celebration rally, including first-class heroes who made meritorious service on the front lines of flood control and those who made meritorious service in supporting flood control in the rear, representatives of flood control units who collectively made meritorious service and won first-class award banners, heads of flood control headquarters at all levels and units supporting flood control in the rear, as well as representatives from all walks of life in Wuhan, democratic parties, and people's organizations.

The celebration rally was held when the Yangtze River water level in Wuhan shifted from the rising period to the falling period, and flood control work had entered a new stage.

At the meeting, Wang Renzhong, the General Commander of the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters, on behalf of the 1.5 million people of Wuhan, expressed his respect and gratitude to all flood control heroes, model flood control units, and the city's flood control army. When the certificates of merit were awarded, the band played the music of "Ode to the Motherland", and the applause lasted for a long time.

The conference unanimously approved the report made by Wang Renzhong on the victory of the flood control struggle and the guiding principles and tasks of future flood control work. The report pointed out that the entire flood control army, after nearly sixty days of intense combat, experienced various dangers and difficulties, and with the strong support of the people of Wuhan and the people from all over the country, safeguarded the safety of the urban area of Wuhan and created a miracle in the history of flood control. At present, the threat of floods to Wuhan is still serious. The future flood control strategy is "tenacity and perseverance, make persistent efforts, and never stop fighting until complete victory is achieved." Many advanced units introduced at the meeting their advanced experiences in flood control and rescue, supporting flood control, and strengthening political work in flood control.

During the celebration rally, more than 200 congratulatory telegrams and letters were received from the Central-South Administrative Committee, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hubei Provincial People's Government, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, and the people of Wuhan and the people from all over the country.

The conference finally adopted a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, expressing that they must make persistent efforts and finally defeat the flood.

At the meeting, the "Joint Declaration of the Democratic Parties and People's Organizations of the People's Republic of China for the Liberation of Taiwan" was read out. The entire audience unanimously cheered and supported this declaration, and immediately drafted and passed a telegram supporting the Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan.
