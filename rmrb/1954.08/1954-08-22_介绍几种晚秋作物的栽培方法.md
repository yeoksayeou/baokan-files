    Editor's Note: This year, since the beginning of summer, there has been excessive rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin, and crops have been flooded in some areas. In order to compensate for the reduced production caused by the floods, Party organizations and People's Governments in these areas are leading farmers to actively drain water and prepare to replant some late autumn crops, such as potatoes, buckwheat, and late millet. However, some farmers lack experience in growing these crops and have written to us requesting information on cultivation methods. Now, we have specially asked the General Bureau of Agricultural Production of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government to introduce the methods of cultivating second-season potatoes, buckwheat, and late millet, for reference by various localities.
    Introduction to Cultivation Methods for Several Late Autumn Crops
    Central Agricultural Department Agricultural Production General Bureau
        I. Methods for Second-Season Potato Cultivation
    The most important issue in second-season potato cultivation is the sprouting treatment of seed potatoes. The seed potatoes used for the second season are newly produced in the first season of the current year. These new tubers have a certain dormancy period, so sprouting must be carried out before sowing in the second season to promote the early germination of the seed potato buds. Sprouting method: First, choose a place with good drainage and air circulation as a seedbed (the bed should be three feet wide, half a foot high, and the length determined by need). It is best to lay one or two inches of fine sandy soil on the bed (if there is no fine sand in the area, soft soil with high humus content can be used instead). Then, use a clean knife to cut the selected seed potatoes without disease spots or rotting into potato pieces (cutting the seed potatoes into pieces has the effect of promoting germination; when cutting, each piece must have at least one to two buds). Spread the potato pieces out in a cool, ventilated place for one day to allow the cuts to heal, and then place them in the seedbed. When placing them, separate the top bud part from the lower half (for planting in batches in the future) and arrange them, with a thickness of about two to three inches (four to five layers of potato pieces, with gaps between the potato pieces, filled with some sand or fine soil). Then cover the potato pieces with one to one and a half inches of moist sand or humus soil. Finally, cover the seedbed with one to two inches of straw.
    Check once on the seventh or eighth day after sprouting to see if the potato pieces are intact and how the budding is progressing. During inspection, just select two or three points around and in the middle of the seedbed, dig out the sand and soil, and take out the potato pieces. After about half a month, when the buds grow to half an inch, they can be dug out and planted.
    The seedbed temperature should be maintained at around 28 degrees Celsius. The moisture content of the bed soil should be such that it can be formed into a ball when held in the hand, and scatters easily when lightly touched, without sticking to the hand. The seedbed should be checked frequently. If the humidity is too high, the straw must be lifted to ventilate; if it is too dry, some water can be sprinkled on the straw to moisten the sand. To facilitate control of temperature and humidity and prevent storms, a shed can be built over the seedbed. In rainy areas in the south, drainage ditches should also be dug on both sides of the seedbed.
    The cultivation method for second-season potatoes is roughly the same as in spring. It is necessary to follow the characteristics of potato growth, carry out deep plowing and apply more fertilizer before sowing, and strengthen field management after emergence and before harvest. However, there is more rain during the autumn planting season, so the planting site should be chosen in a place with good drainage and a high terrain. In the south, high ridges and drainage ditches should be made. The growing season for second-season potatoes is more urgent, so sufficient fertilizer must be supplied, especially fertilizer with high phosphorus and potassium content. If the potato seedlings are growing weakly, it is also necessary to apply nitrogen fertilizer early. But it should not be too late, or it will not form tubers.
    The planting time varies depending on the natural conditions in the north and south (generally, there needs to be a growing season of 75 to 80 days before frost). In the Yangtze River basin, it is around late August, and in the Huai River basin, it can be in mid-August. The plants of second-season potatoes are often slightly shorter than those of the first season, and the row and plant spacing can be appropriately increased. According to farmers' experience, second-season potatoes form tubers earlier, so weeding work must be carried out as soon as possible to avoid damaging the tubers.
      II. Buckwheat Cultivation Methods
    In the south, sowing buckwheat around the Beginning of Autumn (立秋) is most suitable. If sowing is delayed until after the End of Heat (处暑), the buckwheat growing season will be short, the plants will be short, the branching will be less, and the yield will be poor. When preparing the land, weeds on the ground should be removed, and the soil should be leveled, loosened; in areas with low terrain and more rain, high ridges of four and a half feet wide should be made to facilitate drainage. Buckwheat grows quickly, and the roots do not penetrate deep into the soil. Base fertilizer should be well-rotted manure or cake fertilizer, which should be raked into the soil before sowing. If the base fertilizer is insufficient or the seedlings are growing poorly, quick-acting fertilizer such as human manure should be applied when the seedlings are four or five inches high to promote healthy seedling development.
    Buckwheat seedlings have thin and weak stems and leaves, so attention must be paid to sowing depth. Generally, a sowing depth of about half an inch is appropriate. If sowing is too deep, it is easy to cause weak seedlings or missing seedlings. After sowing, it is best to rake lightly to level the ground and loosen the soil to facilitate emergence. If the ground becomes compacted after sowing due to heavy rain, it is necessary to seize the time to use a small iron rake to break the hard crust along the sowing rows to facilitate seedling emergence. The row spacing for strip-sown buckwheat is generally about one foot, and it can be narrower for varieties transferred from the north. The sowing amount generally requires four to six catties per mu, and the amount needs to be appropriately increased for northern varieties. In the south, if trench sowing is used, a layer of plant ash can be sprinkled along the ditch after sowing, and then covered with shallow soil, which is more conducive to emergence.
    Buckwheat seeds often have uneven maturity or affect germination due to year-old storage. Seeds purchased from the market or transferred from other places should be subjected to germination tests first. Those with excessively low germination rates should not be used as seeds. The seed coat of buckwheat is thick, and seed treatment before sowing is very important. According to Soviet experience, sunning the seeds can improve the germination rate of seeds and promote plant development. Soaking in 30 to 40 degrees Celsius warm water for ten minutes can also enhance the seed germination rate.
    Buckwheat has a short growing season, so weeding work must be done before flowering. No weeding should be done after flowering to avoid damaging the plants. The number of weedings should be two to three times. The first weeding should be carried out when the seedlings are two or three inches high, and the seedlings should be appropriately thinned (if the soil is fertile or the fertilizer is sufficient, and the sowing is timely, one strong seedling should be left every three or four inches) so that the plants are not too densely crowded. The second weeding can be carried out when the seedlings are five or six inches high to remove the weeds. If necessary, weeding can be done once more.
    Buckwheat is a cross-pollinated crop that relies on wind and insect pollination. Pollination is often affected by climate changes, resulting in scorched flowers and poor seed setting or low seed setting rate. Therefore, artificial pollination is an effective way to increase buckwheat yield. According to Soviet test results: carrying out artificial pollination three times can increase the yield by 21 to 29 catties per mu. Artificial pollination should be carried out during the peak flowering period from 9:00 to 11:00 in the morning. The method is: use a soft cloth (preferably a flour bag connected together) with ropes tied to both ends, pulled by two people, to wipe over the top of the plants and shake the plants, which can achieve the effect of artificial pollination. Artificial pollination generally needs to be carried out two or three times.
      Buckwheat likes dry climate during the seedling stage, but if the weather is too dry after flowering, appropriate irrigation should be carried out. Slightly drier conditions are required during the grain filling and ripening stage. Buckwheat has a long flowering period, generally taking about twenty days to complete. Its pedicels are small, and the seeds are most prone to falling off after ripening. Therefore, harvest can be carried out when two-thirds of the seeds of the entire plant are dark brown. If there are signs of frost and strong winds, harvest should be carried out quickly. Pay attention to light cutting and light placement when harvesting. After harvesting, dry in the sun and thresh. Seeds for seed retention should be winnowed clean and dried for one or two more days, and then stored in a cool, ventilated place.
  III. Late Millet Cultivation Methods
    Millet is a cultivated crop that prefers dry conditions and should be planted in land with slightly higher terrain and better drainage. In the south, sowing around the Beginning of Autumn is more appropriate. In areas south of the Yangtze River, it is estimated that it can still mature even if sown before the End of Heat. This is because millet needs higher temperatures before flowering and slightly lower temperatures, dry air, and cool breezes after grain filling. Late millet takes about 30 to 40 days from sowing to heading. In the south, the temperature is still quite high during the White Dew (白露) to Autumnal Equinox (秋分) (September), so it is very promising to seize the opportunity from the Beginning of Autumn to the End of Heat to replant late millet in the south.
      Before sowing, the land should be prepared well, the weeds on the ground should be plowed into the ground, and high ridges of four or five feet wide should be made to facilitate drainage. For easy weeding management, the furrow strip sowing method should be adopted, with furrows about one inch deep. After sowing, it is best to sprinkle some plant ash and compost, farm manure, and cover with a layer of shallow soil. The sowing amount is about half a catty to one catty per mu, and the row spacing of one foot to one foot and two inches is most suitable. When the seedlings are two or three inches high, thinning should be carried out, and the dense areas should be thinned out, so that each seedling is one or two inches apart, and attention should be paid to selecting strong seedlings. If local varieties with more tillering are used, they need to be appropriately thinned; for varieties transferred from the north, because they mature early and have less tillering, they can be appropriately densified. At the same time as thinning, weeding and preventing grass from growing together with the seedlings should be carried out. When the seedlings are five or six inches high, the second weeding should be carried out. Before weeding, it is best to concentrate some quick-acting topdressing (such as well-rotted human manure) along the rows to promote seedling growth, especially for varieties transferred from the north, attention should be paid to topdressing. When the seedlings are one foot high, carry out the third weeding. This weeding should be deep and combined with earthing up to prevent lodging. After flowering and grain filling, if the weather is dry, irrigation must be carried out to promote full grain filling.

    编者按：今年长江中下游和淮河流域，自入夏以来雨水过多，部分地区禾苗被淹。为了弥补因水灾而造成的减产损失，这些地区的党组织和人民政府正领导农民积极排除积水并准备补种一些晚秋作物，如马铃薯、荞麦、晚粟（小米）等。但有些农民对种植这种作物缺乏经验，纷纷来信要求我们介绍栽培方法。现在，我们特请中央人民政府农业部农业生产总局把栽培第二季马铃薯和荞麦、晚粟的方法介绍如下，以供各地参考。 
    介绍几种晚秋作物的栽培方法
    中央农业部农业生产总局
        一、马铃薯第二季栽培的方法
    马铃薯第二季栽培中最重要的问题，是种薯的催芽处理。第二季栽培所用的种薯，是当年第一季新生产的。这些新块茎具有一定的休眠期，因此在第二季播种之前必须实行催芽，促使种薯的幼芽早日萌发。催芽的方法：先选择排水良好、空气流通的地方作苗床（床宽三尺、高半尺，长度看需要来定），床上最好铺一二寸细砂土（如无细砂的地区可用腐植质多的松软土壤代替），然后把选好的没有病斑和腐烂现象的种薯，用干净刀切成薯块
  （种薯切块有促进发芽的作用，切时每块上至少要有一至二个芽眼），把薯块放在阴凉通风的地方摊开晾一天，使切口愈合后再放入苗床。放时，要把顶芽部分和下半部分开（以便将来分批种植）排列起来，其厚度约二至三寸（四至五层薯块，薯块与薯块间应留出空隙，填上一些砂或细土），然后在薯块上盖一寸到一寸半的湿润的砂或腐植质土。最后还要在苗床上覆盖一寸到二寸的秸草。
    催芽后的第七、八天要进行一次检查，看看薯块是否完好和出芽情况怎样。检查时，只要在苗床的周围和当中选两三个点拨开砂土取出薯块就行了。约半个月左右，当芽长到半寸时即可挖出种植。
    苗床温度应保持在摄氏二十八度左右，床土的湿度以用手一握成团，轻轻一碰即散，而手上并不沾水为宜。苗床应经常检查，如发现湿度过大时须将秸草掀开通风，过干时可在秸草上洒些水，使砂土湿润。为了便于掌握温、湿度和防止暴风雨，可在苗床上搭一凉棚，在南方多雨地区还应在苗床两侧挖排水沟。
    第二季马铃薯的栽培方法，大致和春季一样，必须依照马铃薯生长的特点，在播种前实行深耕和多施肥料，在出苗后、收获前加强田间管理。但秋种时期雨水较多，种植地应选择排水良好、地势高亢的；南方并应做高畦和排水沟。第二季种的马铃薯生长期较紧迫，因此必须供给充足肥料，特别是含磷钾较多的肥料。如薯苗生长较弱，在早期追施氮肥也是必要的。但不可过晚，晚了就会不结薯块。
    种植时期因南北自然条件的差异而有所不同（一般在降霜前需有七十五至八十天的生长期），长江流域约在八月下旬，淮河流域可在八月中旬。第二季马铃薯的植株常较第一季的稍矮，行株距可适当加密。根据农民经验，第二季马铃薯结薯较早，中耕工作必须及早进行，以免损伤块茎。
      二、荞麦的栽培方法
    南方播种荞麦在立秋前后最为适宜，若延迟至处暑后播种，则荞麦生长期短促，植株长得矮，分杈少，产量较差。在整地时应将地面杂草清除干净，并将土壤整理平整疏松；在地势较低，雨水较多的地区应作成宽四·五尺的高畦，以利排水。荞麦生长迅速，根须入土不深，基肥应施腐熟的厩肥或饼肥，在播种前耙入土中。如基肥不足或幼苗生长不良，应在苗高四、五寸时追施速效性肥料，如人粪尿，以促进幼苗发育健旺。
    荞麦幼苗茎叶细弱，必须注意播种深度。一般以播种深半寸左右为宜，如播种过深，容易造成幼苗纤弱或缺苗等情况。播完种最好用耙轻耙一下，使地面平整，土壤疏松，便于出苗。在播种后如遇暴雨地面板结，必须在雨后抓紧时间用小铁耙顺播种行耙破硬壳，以利幼苗出土。条播的荞麦一般以
  一尺左右为宜，由北方调去的品种还可以窄些。播种量一般每亩需四至六斤，北方品种需要适当加多一些。在南方如用开沟撒播，可在播种后顺沟撒一层草木灰，再覆盖浅土，对于出苗更为有利。
    荞麦种子常因成熟不齐或隔年储藏而影响发芽。凡从市场买来或外地调来的种子应先进行发芽试验，发芽率过低的不宜作种。荞麦种子壳较厚，播种前的种子处理很重要。根据苏联经验，晒种可以提高种子发芽率，促进植株发育。用摄氏三十度到四十度温水浸十分钟也可增强种子发芽率。
    荞麦生长期短，在开花以前必须做好中耕工作，开花后不再进行中耕，以免折损植株。中耕次数以两到三次为宜。在苗高二、三寸时进行第一次中耕，并适当地间苗（如土壤肥沃或施肥充足，播种适时，可每隔三、四寸留壮苗一株），使株间不太密挤。在苗高五、六寸时可实行第二次中耕，要把草除净。以后根据需要还可中耕一次。
    荞麦是异花授粉作物，依靠风力和昆虫传粉，常因气候变化影响授粉，形成焦花不实或结实率低。因此，进行人工辅助授粉是提高荞麦产量的一个有效办法。根据苏联试验结果：进行人工辅助授粉三次，每亩可以增产二十一到二十九斤。人工辅助授粉应在开花盛期的上午九点到十一点的时候进行。方法是：用一条较软的布（最好用面袋连接起来）两头系上绳子，由两个人拉着，顺植株顶部擦过，摇动植株，就能达到辅助授粉的作用。辅助授粉一般须进行两三次。
      荞麦在幼苗期喜欢干燥的气候，但在开花后，若天气过于干旱，就要进行适当灌溉。灌浆结实时，需要稍干燥。荞麦开花期较长，一般约需二十多天才开完，其花柄细小，子实成熟后最易脱落。所以在全株子实有三分之二呈暗褐色时即可收割。若有降霜和大风预兆时，应赶快收获。收获时应注意轻割轻放。收割后晒干脱粒，留种用的要扬净并多晒一两天，然后储存在通风凉爽的地方。
  三、晚粟的栽培方法
    粟是中耕作物，性喜干燥，应选择地势稍高、排水较好的土地种植。南方在立秋前后播种较为适宜，长江以南地区即使在处暑前播种估计还可成熟。因为粟在开花之前需要较高的温度，结实后需温度稍低、空气干燥和带有凉爽的微风气候。而晚粟自播种到抽穗约需三十天到四十天。在南方白露至秋分（九月份）这一阶段气温还相当高，因此在南方抓紧立秋至处暑这一时机补种晚粟，是很有希望的。
      播种前要把地整好，地面杂草要翻犁地下，并应做好宽四、五尺的高畦，以利排水。为便于中耕管理，应采用开沟条播法，沟深约一寸左右。播种后最好撒些草木灰和堆肥、厩肥，并覆盖一层浅土。播种量每亩约需半斤至一斤，行距以一尺至一尺二寸最适合。在苗高二、三寸时，应进行间苗，将苗密的地方疏拔一下，使每根苗距离一、二寸，并注意选留壮苗。如用本地分蘖较多的品种，需适当稀一些；引用北方调来的品种，由于成熟早、分蘖少，可适当加密。在间苗的同时要进行中耕除草、严防草苗齐长。在苗高五、六寸时，要进行第二次中耕，中耕前最好顺行集中施用一些速效追肥（如腐熟的人粪尿），以促进幼苗生长，尤其对北方调来的品种更应注意追肥。苗高一尺时再行第三次中耕，这次中耕宜深，并结合培土以防倒伏。在开花结粒后，如天气干旱，须进行灌溉，以促使籽粒饱满。
