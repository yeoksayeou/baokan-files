Ningxia Province Holds Livestock Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference

The People's Government of Ningxia Province convened a Livestock Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference in early July. The conference initially summarized the achievements and experiences of livestock mutual aid and cooperation work over the past two years and fully exchanged views on carrying out livestock mutual aid and cooperation work in the future.

Since 1952, thirty-four livestock mutual aid groups of various types have been established successively in the pastoral areas, semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and some agricultural areas of Ningxia Province. These mutual aid groups are organized on the basis of the mutual aid habit of "herding together" for many years. Generally, there are two types: one is relatively fixed, grazing together permanently, with a division of labor and production plans; the other is a temporary seasonal form of labor mutual aid, which is a mutual aid organization formed by herders with fewer livestock to save labor. The content of mutual aid includes seasonal work such as wolf hunting, grass cutting, lambing, disaster prevention, shearing, and nomadic movement.

The implementation of labor mutual aid in livestock production has solved the difficulties of insufficient labor and lack of production tools in pastoral areas. For example, the Taosigeleng Mutual Aid Group saved ten laborers in 1953 to go out to repair corrals and shear sheep for others, earning more than 13 million yuan in wages. Last year, the Taosigeleng Mutual Aid Group protected seven grasslands, harvested more than 2,200 catties of wild grass, stored 850 catties of feed, dug five wells, cleaned five springs, newly built two sheepfolds and four sheep cellars, and repaired eight old folds and cellars. Great achievements have also been made in moving corrals and hunting wolves.

After evaluating the past work achievements and summarizing experience, the conference analyzed and criticized the impetuous and rash advances of a small number of cadres who disregarded the actual situation. After discussion, everyone unanimously realized that it is necessary to continue to implement the working policy of "prudence and stability," carry out organizational work on the basis of the herders' voluntary participation and original habits, and conscientiously implement the principle of mutual benefit. The meeting also decided to strengthen leadership over livestock mutual aid and cooperation work.

    宁夏省召开畜牧互助合作会议
    宁夏省人民政府在七月上旬召开了畜牧互助合作会议。会议初步总结了两年多以来畜牧互助合作工作的成绩和经验，并充分地交换了关于今后开展畜牧互助合作工作的意见。
    自一九五二年以来，宁夏省的牧业区、半农半牧区和部分农业区先后建立了各种类型的畜牧互助组三十四个。这些互助组都是在多年“合群放牧”的互助习惯的基础上组织起来的。一般分两种类型：一种是比较定型的，常年在一块互助放牧，有分工和生产计划；另一种是临时季节性的劳动互助形式，是牲畜较少的牧民为了节省劳力而组织的互助组织，互助的内容包括打狼、打草、接羔、防灾、剪毛、移牧等季节性工作。
    畜牧生产实行劳动互助的结果，解决了牧区劳力不足和生产工具缺乏的困难。如陶斯格楞互助组在一九五三年节省了十个劳力出外给别人修圈、剪毛，赚回工资一千三百多万元。陶斯格楞互助组在去年保护了七块草原，打野草两千二百多斤，贮备饲料八百五十斤，修井五眼，掏泉五眼，新修了两个羊圈、四个羊窖，修补旧圈旧窖八个，在搬圈、打狼等方面都获得很大成绩。
    会议在估计了过去的工作成绩并总结经验后，对一少部分干部不顾实际情况的急躁冒进情绪进行了分析和批判。经过讨论，大家一致认识到要继续贯彻“慎重稳进”的工作方针，在牧民自觉自愿和原有习惯的基础上进行组织工作，认真贯彻互利原则。会议并决定要加强对于畜牧互助合作工作的领导。
