    Conscientiously Do a Good Job in the Financial and Capital Construction Management of Cultural and Educational Departments
    Developing cultural and educational undertakings is an important part of achieving the overall task of the state's transition period. To ensure the smooth development of cultural and educational undertakings, it is necessary to manage well the financial and capital construction work of cultural and educational departments, which is of great significance both for cultural and educational undertakings themselves and for the economic construction of the entire country. The Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government held a national working conference on cultural and educational finance and capital construction management on June 16, and the problems it solved and the methods it proposed are very important.
    In 1953, thanks to the correct leadership of the Central Committee and Party committees and governments at all levels, and the efforts of cadres in cultural and educational departments at all levels, considerable achievements were made in the financial and capital construction management of cultural and educational departments. The first was to preliminarily incorporate national cultural and educational expenditures and capital construction into the state plan, in conjunction with the preparation of the national cultural and educational development plan; at the same time, cultural and educational departments at all levels, in accordance with the policy of "rectification and consolidation, key development, improved quality, and steady progress," paid attention to grasping the implementation of the plan, controlling financial expenditures, and striving to complete the vast majority of projects within the year, basically ensuring the needs of cultural and educational development; and generally established or strengthened management institutions, formulated some necessary management systems, strengthened the inspection of plan implementation, paid attention to economy, and took other necessary measures to solve problems and difficulties in the work. At the same time, a group of cadres were trained in the past year, their professional level was improved, some experience was accumulated, and the work rules were initially mastered, which created favorable conditions for further improving management work in the future.
    However, it must be admitted that there are still many problems and shortcomings in the national cultural and educational financial and capital construction management work, mainly: the management policy is not clear enough, the planning is relatively poor, the combination of finance, capital construction, and career needs is not close enough, there is a lack of systematic understanding and inspection of the implementation of the plan, various management systems are not sound, and the spirit of streamlining and saving has not been deeply implemented, and the phenomenon of waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources is still quite serious. This situation is incompatible with the requirements of national planned construction and the development of cultural and educational undertakings.
    With the increasing development of national cultural and educational undertakings, the management of cultural and educational finance and capital construction must be further improved and strengthened in the future. Cultural and educational departments at all levels must organize manpower, materials, and financial resources in a planned and focused manner in accordance with the guidelines and tasks of cultural and educational work to ensure the realization of the cultural and educational development plan. At the same time, in all management work, the principle of "unified leadership, level-by-level management" should be implemented, the scope of responsibilities of cultural and educational departments at all levels should be clarified, management systems should be improved, political and ideological leadership should be strengthened, the inspection and supervision of the implementation of financial budgets and capital construction plans should be strengthened, potential should be fully utilized, and streamlining and economy should be strictly implemented.
    In terms of financial management, cultural and educational departments at all levels must continue to find out the basic situation of various undertakings, distinguish the different types of cultural and educational undertakings, and determine appropriate financial management methods. In management work, the following key points should generally be noted: First, capital construction. This is not only because it accounts for a considerable proportion of cultural and educational expenditures, but also because its completion directly affects the development of the undertaking. If special attention is not paid to it, it will cause great waste and have an adverse impact on the construction of the undertaking. The second is personnel wage expenditure. This is the largest expenditure in cultural and educational funds, accounting for more than 37% of national cultural and educational expenditures. In particular, the phenomenon of improper staffing and bloated personnel is quite common at present, and we must strengthen management in this area. The third is material management and property management. At present, the management situation in this area is very poor. In the future, it is required that the existing housing, equipment, and materials be well understood, and scientific management systems and clear responsibility systems should be gradually established.
    In addition, a unit budget accounting system should be established and improved in cultural and educational departments at all levels, so as to give play to the enthusiasm and initiative of various business departments, reduce the chaotic state of financial management by higher-level competent departments, and strengthen the combination of finance and business.
    In terms of capital construction, attention should be paid to giving play to the potential of existing buildings and equipment, and new projects should be built in a planned and step-by-step manner. Existing houses and equipment should be well maintained and repaired, and should not be easily demolished or abandoned. All projects that must be newly built or expanded should be invested in a differentiated and focused manner according to the importance and urgency of the business tasks. Cultural and educational departments at all levels should comprehensively consider the setting planning work of subordinate units, determine the scope of improvement and expansion and the distribution location, construction scale and land use plan of new units in accordance with the characteristics and requirements of business development, combined with local construction planning and residential distribution. At the same time, the leadership of the design ideas of construction units should be strengthened. Carefully review design documents and engineering budgets, and strive to achieve "solid, applicable, economical, and beautiful" within the planned investment scope, and strictly prevent inappropriate increases in design requirements, improved building structures, and excessive attention to decoration. Clearly stipulate the management responsibilities of construction units, and guide construction units to do a good job in pre-construction preparations. During the construction process, the competent department should strengthen inspection and supervision; the construction unit should closely cooperate with the construction unit to ensure project quality and save construction funds.
    In order to ensure that the financial and capital construction management of cultural and educational departments is well done this year, the responsible comrades of cultural and educational departments at all levels must attach importance to financial and capital construction management work, strengthen political and ideological leadership and specific leadership, and change the current situation of cultural and educational departments not being good at financial management and not being good at housekeeping. It should be recognized that doing a good job in cultural and educational work requires not only managing business well, but also managing finance and capital construction well, that is, it is necessary to do a good job in comprehensive leadership. Only in this way can the smooth development of the undertaking be guaranteed, and financial, material, and human waste or losses to the state can be avoided. In this regard, Party committees and people's governments at all levels are required to supervise earnestly.
    Cadres in cultural and educational departments must also recognize that the basic task of financial and capital construction work is to rationally use state funds and ensure the realization of cultural and educational development plans economically and materially. Therefore, it must serve the cause, implement the principle of streamlining and economy, and save more funds for the state to support industrial construction. Cadres in financial and capital construction work in cultural and educational departments should especially fully understand the important political significance of their personal work in national construction, love and value their work, establish an overall concept, resolutely overcome purely financial and technical viewpoints, and integrate the spirit of streamlining and economy into their daily work, and closely integrate it with the improvement of management work.
    At present, the financial and capital construction management institutions and cadre situation of cultural and educational departments, especially those below the provincial (municipal) level, are generally not commensurate with the work requirements. Cultural and educational departments at all levels should improve the financial and capital construction management work institutions according to the size of the task and the complexity of the work, and fill them with necessary full-time cadres. For the existing working cadres, attention must be paid to planned training and improvement, organizing them to study various relevant policies, systems, methods and business knowledge, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the management experience of other departments, advocate hard work in studying business, and combine with practice to improve the style of work, and train them to become specialized cadres. And a sense of discipline must be established among all cadres, and the idea of special treatment that is unwilling to be bound by plans and unwilling to be bound by discipline must be resolutely opposed. In the past, phenomena such as falsely reporting base figures, loosely budgeting, or not turning in income and not turning over surpluses to the treasury have been discovered. These are not allowed by national discipline and must be resolutely corrected in the future.
    The task before us in 1954 is very arduous, and we will certainly encounter many new problems and new difficulties on the road ahead. Therefore, in order to realize the guidelines and tasks determined by the National Working Conference on Cultural and Educational Finance and Capital Construction Management, cultural and educational departments at all levels must do a lot of work in terms of organization and ideology. There should be no pride and complacency. We must continue to deeply examine our work, summarize our work experience in a timely manner, improve our work in a timely manner, and carry out criticism and self-criticism, constantly correcting mistakes and shortcomings, and moving forward in overcoming difficulties. We must be good at relying on the masses, contacting the masses, and giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, so that we can overcome any difficulties on the road ahead and strive to successfully complete the glorious task of 1954.

    认真做好文教部门的财务和基本建设管理工作
    发展文教事业，是实现国家过渡时期总任务的重要组成部分。为了保证文教事业顺利发展，必须管好文教部门的财务和基本建设工作，这不论对于文教事业本身或者对于整个国家的经济建设，都有很重要的意义。中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会于六月十六日召开了全国文教财务、基本建设管理工作会议，它所解决的问题和提出的办法都是很重要的。
    一九五三年文教部门的财务、基本建设管理工作，由于中央和各级党委、政府的正确领导，各级文教部门干部的努力，取得了不少成绩。首先是结合全国文教事业计划的编制，相应地将全国文教支出和基本建设初步纳入了国家计划轨道；同时各级文教部门根据“整顿巩固，重点发展，提高质量，稳步前进”的方针，注意掌握了计划的执行，控制了财务支出，争取到绝大部分工程在当年内完工，基本上保证了文教事业发展的需要；并且一般都建立了或加强了管理机构，制订了一些必要的管理制度，加强了对计划执行情况的检查，注意了节约，并为解决工作中的问题和困难，采取了其他一些必要的措施。同时，一年来工作中还锻炼出一批干部，提高了业务水平，积累了一些经验，初步掌握了工作规律，这就为今后进一步改进管理工作创造了有利条件。
    但必须承认，在全国文教财务、基本建设管理工作中，也还有不少问题和缺点，主要是：管理方针还不够明确，计划性比较差，财务、基本建设和事业需要的结合不够密切，对计划的执行情况缺乏系统的了解和检查，各项管理制度也很不健全，精简节约精神还没有深入贯彻，人力、物力、财力的浪费现象还相当严重。这种情况是和国家计划建设及文教事业发展的要求不相适应的。
    随着全国文教事业的日益发展，今后文教财务、基本建设管理工作必须进一步改进与加强。各级文教部门必须根据文教工作的方针任务有计划有重点地组织人力、物力、财力，以保证文教事业计划的实现，同时在各项管理工作中，应贯彻“统一领导、分级管理”的原则，明确各级文教部门的职责范围，健全管理制度，加强政治思想领导，加强对财务预算和基本建设计划执行情况的检查监督，充分发挥潜力，厉行精简节约。
    在财务管理方面，各级文教部门必须继续摸清各项事业的基本情况，分别文教事业的不同类型，确定适当的财务管理办法。在管理工作上，一般应注意以下几个重点：第一是基本建设。这不仅是由于它在文教支出中占相当大的比重，而且它的完成好坏直接关系到事业的发展，如果不加以特别注意，就会造成很大的浪费，并对事业建设发生不利的影响。第二是人员工资开支。这是文教经费中最大的一项开支，占全国文教支出的百分之三十七以上，特别是目前编制不当、人员臃肿的现象相当普遍，我们必须加强这方面的管理。第三是物资管理和财产管理。目前在这方面的管理情况很差，今后要求对现有房屋、设备、物资情况作到心中有数，并逐步建立科学的管理制度和明确的责任制度。
    此外，要在各级文教部门中建立与健全单位预算会计制度，以便发挥各事业部门的积极性和主动性，减少上级主管部门管理财务上的忙乱状态，加强财务与事业的结合。
    在基本建设方面，应注意发挥原有建筑、设备的潜力，有计划有步骤地兴建新的工程。对于旧有房屋和设备应很好地注意保固维修，不得轻易拆除和废置。凡必须新建或扩建的工程，应根据事业任务的轻重缓急，有区别、有重点地投资。各级文教部门应通盘考虑所属单位的设置规划工作，按照事业发展的特点和要求，结合当地建设规划和居民分布情况，确定改进和扩建范围及新建单位的分布地点、建设规模和用地方案。同时应加强对建设单位设计思想的领导。认真审查设计文件和工程预算，在计划投资范围内作到“坚固、适用、经济、美观”，严格防止不适当地提高设计要求、提高建筑结构及过分讲究装饰。明确规定建设单位的管理职责，指导建设单位作好施工前的准备工作。在施工过程中，主管部门应加强检查监督；建设单位应密切与施工单位合作，确保工程质量，节约建设资金。
    为了保证作好今年文教部门的财务、基本建设管理工作，各级文教部门负责同志必须重视财务和基本建设管理工作，加强政治思想领导和具体领导，改变文教部门不善于理财、不善于管家务的现状。应该认识，作好文教工作不仅要管好业务，还要管好财务和基本建设，也就是必须作好全面的领导，只有这样，才能保证事业的顺利发展，才能避免给国家造成财力、物力、人力上的浪费或损失。在这方面，要求各级党委和各级人民政府加以认真地督促。
    文教部门的干部还必须认识财务、基本建设工作的基本任务是合理运用国家资金，从经济上物质上保证文教事业计划的实现。因此它必须是为事业服务的，必须实行精简节约的原则，为国家多节省一些资金，以支援工业建设。文教部门的财务、基本建设工作干部特别应该充分了解到个人工作在国家建设中的重要政治意义，热爱与重视自己的工作，树立整体观念，坚决克服单纯的财务观点和技术观点，并把精简节约精神贯彻到日常工作中去，和改进管理工作密切结合起来。
    目前文教部门尤其是省（市）以下文教部门的财务和基本建设管理机构及干部情况，和工作要求一般是不相称的。各级文教部门应根据任务大小、工作繁简，健全财务和基本建设管理工作机构，充实必要的专职干部。对于现有的工作干部必须注意有计划地培养提高，组织他们学习各项有关政策、制度、办法和业务知识，学习苏联的先进经验和其他部门的管理经验，提倡刻苦钻研业务，并联系实际改进工作的作风，培养他们成为专业化的干部。而在所有干部中都必须树立纪律观点，坚决反对那种不愿受计划约束、不愿受纪律约束的特殊化的思想。过去曾发现有虚报基数、宽打窄用或收入不上缴、结余不交库等等现象，这都是国家纪律所不能允许的，今后必须坚决纠正。
    摆在我们面前的一九五四年的工作任务是很繁重的，在前进的道路上一定还会遇到许多新的问题和新的困难。因此，各级文教部门为着实现全国文教财务、基本建设管理工作会议所决定的方针任务，无论在组织上和思想上还必须做许许多多的工作，不能有任何骄傲自满，必须继续深入地检查工作，及时总结工作经验，及时改进工作，并开展批评与自我批评，不断地纠正错误与缺点，在克服困难中前进。我们要善于依靠群众、联系群众，充分发挥群众的积极性、创造性，这样就可以克服前进道路上的任何困难，为胜利完成一九五四年的光荣任务而奋斗。
