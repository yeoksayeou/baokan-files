A Call to the Young Men and Women of All Countries
Young Men and Women of All Countries:

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council meeting held in Beijing in August 1954 studied the issue of the movement of young people in colonies and dependent countries to fight for their rights, national independence, and peace.

　　We have reached a unanimous conclusion: poverty, hunger, unemployment, widespread infectious diseases, illiteracy, racial discrimination, and the loss of political rights, all of these are the fates encountered by young men and women in colonies and dependent countries. The colonial system deprives the people of these countries of the right to decide their own destiny, hinders their economic development, and destroys their national culture.

　　The people and youth of all countries are increasingly strengthening their struggle against colonialism and for national independence, peace, and a better future.

　　Youth, like all of humanity, welcomes with great joy the signing of the Geneva Accords that ended the war in Indochina.

　　The success of the Geneva Conference once again proves that it is possible to resolve all international issues through peaceful means.

　　Young men and women of colonies and dependent countries:

　　For the sake of a better future, peace, and the security of all peoples, we call on all youth organizations in colonies and dependent countries, and on all colonial young men and women.

　　Strive more vigorously for the complete independence of your countries, for the right to freely determine your own destiny, and for the free development of national economies and cultures!

　　Rise up against all armed aggression, against suppression, against any foreign interference in your country's internal affairs, against dragging your country into military blocs, and against the establishment of strategic bases on your homeland's soil!

　　Rise up to express your support for a thorough and peaceful resolution of the Korean and Indochina issues! Express your support for the peaceful resolution of all disputes and the further consolidation of friendship among all peoples! Resolutely demand the satisfaction of your rights! Resolutely demand that youth be given land, guaranteed work, reasonable wages, medical relief, the right and conditions for education, and democratic and civil rights!

　　Young men and women of all countries! Youth of the suzerain states!

　　The colonial system and colonial wars have worsened the living conditions of you and the youth of colonial countries and threaten your peaceful future.

　　We call on you to give your full support and most active assistance to the noble struggle of young people in colonies and dependent countries for national independence, peace, and youth rights!

　　We more loudly call on you to resolutely demand from parliaments and your own governments that the people of the colonies be granted true independence, that all colonial wars such as the Malayan War be terminated, and that the suppression of the people of colonies and dependent countries be stopped. Expand and strengthen your cooperation and unity with the youth of these countries.

　　The Council calls on all young men and women to consolidate the unity of youth from all strata.

　　Unity is the best way for us to strive for a happy future. Unity is strength. Only through joint action can we realize our rights.

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council calls on all international, national, and local youth organizations, and on all those who care about the miserable fate of youth in colonies and dependent countries, to unite and ensure the victory of the just and vital aspirations of the younger generation!

　　Forward towards peace, towards the national independence of colonial countries and a bright future for youth!

　　Resolution on the World Federation of Democratic Youth and its Member Organizations' Participation in the Preparatory Work for the International Rural Youth Conference

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council notes with satisfaction that, in response to the call from Italian youth to hold an International Rural Youth Conference, young men and women in rural areas and cities have launched a variety of intensive activities worldwide to prepare for this conference. Rural youth have widely discussed the call issued by the International Preparatory Committee for the International Rural Youth Conference and its draft program of rural youth demands. Rural youth have launched actions to defend their rights.

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council points out that the active participation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth's member organizations in this work is of positive significance for the success of the International Rural Youth Conference. However, we believe that these organizations should give the Italian youth's initiative even broader support. Currently, the preparatory work has entered its final stage, and the conference date is less than four months away.

　　The Council believes that the activities of the World Federation of Democratic Youth have a decisive role in the success of the International Rural Youth Conference. Therefore, it requests all member organizations to actively strengthen their efforts to do a good job in preparing for the conference, in formulating the program of rural youth demands, and in organizing youth to fight for the satisfaction of their demands.

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth's member organizations should, based on the different conditions and circumstances in each country, initiate various activities to fight for the rights of rural youth, such as organizing local, regional, and national rural youth conferences, gatherings, mass rallies, demonstrations, and assemblies, drafting handbooks of demands, petitions, etc., and actively participating in the work of the conference's preparatory committees and committees for defending rural youth rights.

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council regards continuously strengthening the unity of all youth in the struggle for rights, peace, and national independence as its primary task.

　　The Council suggests to its member organizations that, when carrying out the preparatory work for the conference, they should ensure that the broadest possible range of rural youth from various strata, such as peasants, agricultural workers, tenant farmers, and young women, can participate, and that they should also involve young workers, students, and young intellectuals in the preparatory movement.

　　It is necessary to involve the unorganized masses of rural youth and various national and local youth organizations in the preparatory work for the conference.

　　Currently, the work of appointing delegations to attend the International Rural Youth Conference is underway. It is hoped that it will be possible to ensure that the various strata of youth have appropriate representation in the delegations. It is important to mobilize young men and women to entrust the representatives with the most pressing demands of rural youth so that they can be raised at the International Rural Youth Conference for discussion. It is hoped that everyone can ensure that the representatives receive material assistance during their journey.

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council appeals to all international, national, and local youth organizations, including political, trade union, religious, cultural, sports, student, and other groups, and calls on them to actively participate in the preparatory work for the International Rural Youth Conference.

　　The Council emphasizes that it is necessary to strengthen the publicity of the purposes, tasks, and nature of the International Rural Youth Conference in every country. For this purpose, radio, newspapers, films, leaflets, slogans, postcards, etc., should be widely used. The periodicals of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the national organizations should use far more space than they currently do to publicize the aims of the conference and report on the experiences gained in the preparatory work process.

　　The Council directs the Executive Committee and Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth to more proactively support the work of the International Committee and to assist the International Committee in every way to successfully complete its tasks.

　　The Council believes that this activity should help develop the democratic movement of rural youth in areas where it is not yet developed, and should help the member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth enhance their prestige and attract large numbers of new rural youth to their ranks.

　　The Council is confident that young men and women of all countries will participate in the preparatory work for the International Rural Youth Conference with even greater enthusiasm and will achieve new successes in the global struggle for a better future, for peace, and for national independence.

　　Resolution on Holding the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council, considering the requests made by organizations from many countries, has decided to hold the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival in July and August of 1955.

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council welcomes with gratitude the invitation from the Polish Youth Union to hold the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival in Warsaw.

　　The Fifth World Festival must be a new and greater expression of the unity of the younger generation in defending peace and strengthening the unity among all peoples.

　　The Fifth World Youth and Student Festival must be the greatest international review of the strength and creativity of youth in culture and sports.

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council calls on all youth, regardless of political or religious beliefs or social status, and regardless of nationality or race, to actively participate in preparing for and sending representatives to this festival, which has a great tradition.

　　In order to successfully prepare for the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival, the Council approves the establishment of a most representative International Preparatory Committee for the festival, composed of the most diverse organizations and prominent figures from all walks of life. It is necessary to establish local, regional, national committees.

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council expresses its satisfaction with the International Student Union's request to jointly convene the Fifth Festival and calls on all international, national, and local youth and student organisations, political, trade union, religious, cultural, sports and other groups and prominent figures in these fields to support the convening of the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship, and to actively participate in the preparatory work and the festival.

　　The Council, using as a basis for its work the many suggestions made at this meeting of the Council, and taking into account the experience of previous festivals and regional and national activities held by young people, directs the Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth to draft a concrete plan for preparing for the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival.

　　In the work of preparing for the Fifth Festival, the member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth should increase their activities and expand their influence among young people in order to strengthen the struggle of the younger generation to defend their rights and to fight for national independence and peace.

　　The program of the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival should be diverse and rich in content, and should be more exciting than the programs of previous festivals. These programs should reflect the interests of youth from all walks of life and youth groups.

　　The Council recommends that the member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth organize festivals, gatherings, mass rallies, and cultural and sports competitions of various sizes among young people and students, and use all possible means, especially newspapers and radio stations, to widely publicize the purpose and nature of the Fifth Festival.

　　The Council is confident that the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival will be a powerful and unforgettable mobilization for peace and friendship.

　　Forward to the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship!

    世界青联理事会北京会议的决议
    向各国青年男女的号召书各国青年男女们：
      一九五四年八月在北京召开的世界民主青年联盟理事会会议研究了殖民地和附属国青年争取权利，争取民族独立与和平的运动的问题。
    我们得出了一致的结论：贫困、饥饿、失业、大量流行的传染病、文盲、种族歧视、丧失政治权利，这一切就是殖民地和附属国青年男女所遭遇到的命运。殖民制度剥夺了这些国家人民决定自己命运的权利，阻碍他们经济的发展，并摧残他们的民族文化。
    各国人民和青年日益加强他们反对殖民主义、争取民族独立、和平和美好将来的斗争。
    青年们和全人类一样，以极大的喜悦心情欢迎结束了印度支那战争的日内瓦协议的签订。
    日内瓦会议的成功，再一次证明了，用和平的方法来解决一切国际问题是可能的。
    殖民地和附属国的青年男女们：
    为了美好将来、和平和各国人民的安全，我们向所有殖民地及附属国的青年组织，向一切殖民地青年男女发出号召。
    更有力地争取你们国家的完全独立，争取自由决定自己命运的权利，争取民族的经济和文化的自由发展！
    起来反对一切武装侵略，反对镇压，反对外国对你们国家内政的任何干涉，反对将你们的国家拖入军事集团，反对在你们祖国的土地上建立战略基地！
    起来表示你们拥护朝鲜及印度支那问题的彻底和平解决！表示你们拥护和平解决一切争端及更进
  一步巩固各国人民之间的友谊！坚决要求满足你们的权利！坚决要求使青年得到土地，得到工作的保证，得到合理的工资，得到医疗救济，得到受教育的权利和条件，得到民主权利和公民权利！
    各国男女青年们！宗主国家的青年们！
    殖民主义制度及殖民战争造成了你们及殖民地国家青年生活情况的恶化并威胁着你们和平的将来。
    我们号召你们对殖民地和附属国青年争取民族独立、和平与青年权利的崇高斗争给予全力支持和最积极的援助！
    我们更响亮地号召你们向议会，向本国政府坚决要求使殖民地人民获得真正的独立，终止一切殖民战争如马来亚战争和停止对殖民地和附属国人民进行的镇压。扩大并加强你们与这些国家青年的合作与团结。
    理事会号召一切青年男女巩固各阶层青年的团结。
    团结是我们争取幸福将来的最好的方法。团结就是力量。只有靠共同的行动，我们才能够使我们的权利得到实现。
    世界青联理事会号召各国际性、各全国性和地方性的青年组织，号召一切关心殖民地和附属国青年的悲惨命运的人们，团结起来，使青年一代正义的和切身的愿望得到胜利！
    向着和平，向着殖民地国家的民族独立和青年的美好将来前进！
    关于世界民主青年联盟及其
      成员组织参加国际农村青
    年大会筹备工作的决议
    世界青年联盟理事会满意地看到：在响应意大利青年所提出的举行一个国际农村青年大会的号召时，农村中以及城市中的青年男女为了筹备这一大会，在全世界范围内展开了多种多样紧张的活动。农村青年广泛地讨论了国际农村青年大会国际筹备委员会所发出的号召及其草拟的农村青年要求纲领草案。农村青年为保卫自身权利展开了行动。
    世界青联理事会指出：世界青联的成员组织积极参加这项工作，对开好国际农村青年大会，是有着积极意义的。但是，我们认为这些组织还应该给予意大利青年的倡议以更广泛的支援。目前，筹备工作已进入结束阶段，距离大会会期只有不到四个月的时间了。
      理事会认为世界青联的活动对开好国际农村青年大会有着决定作用，因此请求所有成员组织，积极加强努力，作好大会筹备工作，作好拟定农村青年要求纲领的工作，以及发动青年为使他们的要求能够得到满足而进行斗争的组织工作。
    世界青联各成员组织，应当根据各个国家不同的条件和情况，发起各种争取农村青年权利的活动，例如组织地方性、区域性和全国性的农村青年会议、聚会、群众大会、示威和集会，草拟要求纲领的手册、请愿书等，积极参加大会的筹备委员会以及保卫农村青年权利委员会的工作。
    世界青联理事会把不断加强全体青年在争取权利、和平、民族独立的斗争中的团结，作为自己主要的任务。
    理事会向各成员组织建议，在进行大会筹备工作时，应当使最广泛的各个不同阶层的农村青年，如农民、农业工人、佃农、女青年等都能参加，并应当把青年工人、学生、青年知识分子等吸收到筹备运动中来。
    必须吸收农村中尚未组织起来的青年群众以及各个不同的全国性和地方性青年组织，参加大会的筹备工作。
    目前，大家正在进行指派出席国际农村青年大会的代表团的工作。希望最好能够做到使各个不同的青年阶层都有适当的代表参加到各代表团里来。重要的是，要发动青年男女把农村青年最迫切的要求都委托给代表们，以便提到国际农村青年大会上去讨论。希望大家能够保证使代表们在旅程中得到物质帮助。
    世界青联理事会向一切国际性的、全国性的和地方性的青年组织、包括各政治、工会、宗教、文化、体育、学生及其他团体发出呼吁，号召他们积极参加国际农村青年大会的筹备工作。
    理事会强调指出：必须在每一个国家内加强宣传国际农村青年大会的目的、任务和性质。为此目的，广播、报纸、电影、传单、标语、明信片等应当能广泛地利用。世界青联以及各全国性组织的定期刊物应当用远比现在为多的篇幅，宣传大会的目的，并报道筹备工作进程中所取得的经验。
    理事会责成世界青联执行委员会与书记处更加主动地支持国际委员会的工作，并以一切方法，帮助国际委员会胜利地完成其任务。
    理事会认为：这一活动应当帮助农村青年民主运动尚未发展的地区得到发展，应当帮助世界青联各成员组织，提高其声望，使大批新的农村青年群众参加到它们的行列里来。
    理事会确信：各国青年男女将以更为高涨的热情，参加国际农村青年大会的筹备工作，并将在全世界争取美好将来，争取和平与民族独立的斗争中取得新的成就。
  关于举行第五届世界青年与
    学生和平友谊联欢节的决
      议
    世界青联理事会考虑了许多国家的组织所提出来的要求，决定在一九五五年七、八月间举行第五届世界青年与学生联欢节。
    世界青联理事会怀着感激的心情欢迎波兰青年联盟关于在华沙举行第五届世界青年与学生联欢节的邀请。
    第五届世界联欢节必须是青年一代在保卫和平中的团结及加强各国人民间的团结的一个新的更伟大的表示。
    第五届世界青年与学生联欢节必须是在文化和体育方面对青年的力量和创造力的一次最伟大的国际检阅。
    世界青联理事会号召一切青年不分政治和宗教信仰或社会地位，不分民族和种族，一律要十分积极地参加筹备这次具有伟大传统的联欢节并派代表参加。
    为了胜利地筹备第五届世界青年与学生联欢节，理事会赞成成立一个最有代表性的、由最不相同的组织和各界的知名人士组成的联欢节国际筹备委员会。建立地方性、地区性和全国性的委员会是必要的。
    世界青联理事会对国际学联关于共同召开第五届联欢节的要求表示满意；并号召一切国际的、全国性的和地方性的青年和学生组织，政治、工会、宗教、文化、体育及其他团体以及在这些方面的知名人士支持召开第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节，并积极参加筹备工作和联欢节。
    理事会以理事会这次会议中提出的许多建议为工作的基础，考虑了历届联欢节和青年举行的地区性和全国性活动的经验，责成世界青联书记处草拟筹备第五届世界青年与学生联欢节的具体计划。
    在筹备第五届联欢节的工作中，世界青联的成员组织应增加他们的活动并扩大他们在青年中的影响，以加强青年一代为保卫他们的权利，争取民族独立与和平的斗争。
    第五届世界青年与学生联欢节的节目应该是多样化和内容丰富的，并应比历届联欢节的节目更精彩。这些节目应该反映各阶层青年和青年团体的利益。
    理事会建议世界青联的成员组织在青年和学生中间组织各种规模的联欢节、集会、群众大会和文娱、体育竞赛，并用一切可能的方法，特别是报纸和广播电台来广泛宣传第五届联欢节的目的和性质。
    理事会确信第五届世界青年与学生联欢节将是争取和平与友谊的一次强有力的和难以忘怀的动员。
    向第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节前进！
