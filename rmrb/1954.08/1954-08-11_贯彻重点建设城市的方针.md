    Our urban construction work is advancing along the direction of socialist urban construction. It is fundamentally different from capitalist cities built on the basis of cruel exploitation of the working class. In socialist cities, all construction serves the interests of the working people. Ensuring the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of workers is the basic feature of socialist cities.

    The cities left to us by old China were cities that served the interests of the ruling class. In these cities, good buildings, good roads, and modern public utilities were concentrated in the "wealthy areas" inhabited by a small number of the ruling class and foreign invaders, while the broad masses of working people were crowded into narrow, dirty streets and dilapidated houses, without sufficient sunlight and breathing polluted air. The people's power has changed the nature of the cities. After the founding of New China, the Party and the government used great efforts to change this unreasonable situation. From 1950 to 1954, the state spent more than ten trillion yuan on building public utilities and improving environmental sanitation. According to statistics from twenty cities up to the end of 1953, the total length of tap water pipelines increased by more than 1,900 kilometers, and the length of sewers increased by more than 1,400 kilometers; the number of buses, trams, and trolleybuses in various cities increased by nearly 2,000. In 1952 alone, Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Anshan, and Shanghai built approximately five million square meters of workers' housing. Many stinking pools and ditches that spread diseases for many years, such as Shichahai and Longxugou in Beijing, and Qiangzi River and Jinzhong River in Tianjin, have been thoroughly renovated, bringing a comfortable and clean living environment to millions of working people.

    There are still many unreasonable places left over from the old society, which cannot be completely changed overnight. We will gradually transform these old cities in the future. At the same time, with the development of economic construction, our country will also expand and build many new cities. Our capital, Beijing, will be built more beautiful and magnificent than it is now in the coming period. Some of our commercial cities or cities with little industry will gradually become large-scale modern industrial cities with the construction of new and huge industrial enterprises. Many smaller cities will be transformed and expanded into very large cities. From the overall planning and layout of the city to the completion of each building, these new cities that are expanded and built in a planned way will always follow the principles of socialist urban construction and build them into completely new cities that fully reflect the interests of the working people.

    Transforming our old cities and building our new cities according to the standards of socialist cities is our firm and unwavering goal. However, in specific steps, we must adhere to the policy of focusing on key construction and advancing steadily. We know that no city can be built out of thin air; it must always rely on a certain material foundation. Generally speaking, in socialist society, the material foundation on which cities develop may be industry, transportation, health and convalescence, cultural and educational undertakings, or the gathering of administrative organs, and so on. However, the most important and basic of these is industry. Only with the development of industry can the development of transportation, culture, education, and other undertakings be driven, and only then can cities mainly serving these undertakings emerge. Therefore, the construction and development of socialist cities must be subordinate to the construction and development of socialist industry; the development speed of socialist cities must be determined by the development speed of socialist industry. This objective law is the fundamental reason for determining that our country's urban construction policy must be focused on key construction and advance steadily.

    This policy of urban construction fully represents the highest interests of the people of the whole country, and it is completely in line with the spirit of the Party's general line during the transition period. However, in actual work, there are still many people who do not understand this policy, and there are still many thoughts and practices that violate this policy. For example, some comrades, although there is not much industrial construction in their cities, or even if the city is not very large and the population is not very large, they have also formulated huge plans, demolishing houses, widening roads, and building on a large scale, wasting a lot of funds. Some comrades overemphasize the many unreasonable places left over from the old society in the existing cities, and depart from the current economic possibilities and realistic conditions, attempting to completely transform them all at once and immediately turn them into ideal socialist cities. Some comrades working in key industrial construction cities feel that since they are the key, they should look like a "key" in everything, and want to do everything and "advance simultaneously." In the planning of the city, they are determined to make it big and new, not paying attention to using the existing foundation of the old city, and even attempting to completely abandon the old city and build everything from scratch; and they spread the burden very widely, making the city construction very dispersed, which increases the cost of various municipal constructions. Of course, these comrades have good intentions, and their purpose is to improve the living conditions of the people. Some of their opinions do reflect the demands of the broad masses. However, these kinds of thoughts and emotions exist to varying degrees of one-sidedness. They only see that our cities are different from capitalist cities and serve the working people; but they forget that the improvement of life must be based on the improvement of production, and they forget that if we build on a large scale today and do everything at once, using the limited funds to universally expand cities, especially to increase the construction of cinemas, gardens, and other larger projects, then it will disperse the state's funds and damage the interests of the entire industrialization, and without industrialization, there will be no future development and transformation of socialist cities.

    The current urban construction work must ensure the policy of serving the country's industrial construction and socialist industrialization. Specifically, we must first concentrate our efforts on building those new industrial cities with important projects. These cities had no industrial base in the past, and now they must build large-scale modern industries, which must be matched with modern urban public utilities. These types of cities should be the focus of all our urban construction work. Secondly, there are modern cities that originally had a certain industrial base. Now, many factories need to be expanded and built in these cities. These cities should be placed in the second place in our country's urban construction work, and necessary reconstruction and expansion should be carried out with the development of industry. As for some large cities and general medium and small cities with not much industrial construction in the first five-year plan, although there are still many unreasonable places left over from the old society and places that cannot meet the material and cultural life requirements of the people, these cities can only carry out general maintenance and repairs, and basically cannot carry out new construction. In order to concentrate our efforts to ensure industrial construction, even in the key cities, we should focus on construction projects such as roads, sewers, and workers' housing that directly serve industrial production. Although other living and welfare facilities must be fully considered in urban planning, the steps of construction must be divided into priorities and must be carried out gradually with the development of industry.

    At present, the highest interest of our people is to realize the country's socialist industrialization. To this end, we must practice strict economy in all aspects, so that the current material and cultural requirements of individuals are subordinate to the long-term interests of the country's industrial construction. This spirit should run through all work, and urban construction work should of course be no exception. Therefore, once this principle is clarified, the comrades in those non-key cities should subordinate their local interests to the overall interests of the country and no longer ask the state for excessive investment to carry out urban reconstruction and expansion; instead, they should, on the one hand, try to extract their technical forces to support key cities, and on the other hand, actively tap potential, improve management, and actively meet the material and cultural life requirements of the people under the existing conditions. And the comrades who work in those key cities must further clarify the idea of serving industrial construction. On the one hand, they should try to reduce and economize on the expenses of various constructions that are not directly related to production; on the other hand, they should work hard to overcome difficulties, actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive to complete the urban planning and design and various important municipal construction projects on time, so as to ensure the smooth construction of the 141 key projects designed by the Soviet Union to help our country. As for the broad masses of urban working people and suburban farmers in new industrial cities, they should also endure some temporary difficulties and fully support and support the country's socialist industrial construction. As long as we work hard to do this, happy and beautiful socialist cities will surely grow up more and more on the land of the motherland.

    贯彻重点建设城市的方针
    我国的城市建设工作是遵循着社会主义城市建设的方向前进的。它与建立在对工人阶级残酷剥削基础上的资本主义城市有着本质的不同。在社会主义城市中，一切建设都是为劳动人民的利益服务的。保证劳动者物质文化生活水平的不断提高，是社会主义城市的基本特征。
    旧中国遗留给我们的城市，都是为统治阶级利益服务的城市。在这些城市中，好的建筑物和好的道路、近代化的公用设施，都集中在少数统治阶级和外国侵略者居住的“富贵之区”，而广大劳动人民则拥挤在狭窄肮脏的街巷和矮小破烂的房屋里，没有充足的阳光，呼吸着污浊的空气。人民的政权改变了城市的性质。新中国成立之后，党和政府用了很大的力量来改变这种不合理的状况。从一九五○年到一九五四年的五年中，国家一共支出了十万多亿元来修建公用事业和改善环境卫生。根据二十个城市截至一九五三年底的统计，自来水管线共增加了一千九百多公里，下水道增加了一千四百多公里；各个城市中的公共汽车，有轨及无轨电车增加了近两千辆。仅一九五二年一年中，北京、天津、沈阳、鞍山、上海五个城市就修了五百万平方公尺左右的工人住宅。许多长年累月传播疾病的臭水坑、臭水沟，像北京的什刹海、龙须沟，天津的墙子河、金钟河，都进行了彻底的整修，给成百万的劳动人民带来了舒适干净的生活环境。
    旧社会遗留下来的不合理的地方还有很多，不是一朝一夕所能完全改变过来的，今后我们还将逐步地对这些旧城市进行改造。同时，随着经济建设的发展，我国还将扩建和新建许多城市。我国的首都——北京市将在今后一段时期中，建设得比现在更美丽更壮观。我们有些商业城市或工业很少的城市，随着新的巨大的工业企业的建设，也将逐步变成一座座拥有新的近代化的大工业城市。许多规模较小的城市，将要改造扩大成为规模很大的城市。这些有计划地扩建和建设起来的新城市，从全城的规划布局开始，直至每一座建筑物落成，我们将始终遵循着社会主义城市建设的原则，把它们建设成为充分反映劳动人民利益的完全新型的城市。
    按照社会主义城市的标准改造我国的旧城市和建设我国的新城市，是我们坚定不移的奋斗目标。但是，在具体步骤上却必须坚持重点建设稳步前进的方针。我们知道，任何一个城市都不可能凭空建设起来，它总是要依托于一定的物质基础。一般的说，在社会主义社会中，城市所赖以发展的物质基础可能是工业、运输业、卫生疗养事业、文化教育事业，也可能是行政管理机关的聚集以及其他等等。但是，其中最重要最基本的乃是工业。只有工业发展了，才能带动交通运输业、文化教育事业等等的发展，也才可能出现主要为这些事业服务的城市。因此，社会主义城市的建设和发展，必然要从属于社会主义工业的建设和发展；社会主义城市的发展速度必然要由社会主义工业发展的速度来决定。这个客观规律是决定我国城市建设方针必须是重点建设、稳步前进的根本原因。
    城市建设工作的这个方针充分代表了全国人民的最高利益，它是完全符合于党在过渡时期总路线的精神的。但是，在实际工作中间却还有很多人不了解这个方针，还存在着不少违反这个方针的思想和做法。譬如，有一些同志，虽然他们所在的城市并没有多少工业建设，甚至本来城市就不大，人口就不多，但他们也拟订了庞大的计划，把房屋拆掉，马路放宽，大兴土木，浪费了很多资金。有些同志过分强调现有城市中很多旧社会遗留下来的不合理的地方，而脱离了当前的经济的可能和现实的条件，企图一下子把它全部改造过来，马上变成理想的社会主义城市。有些在重点工业建设城市中工作的同志，觉得自己既然是重点，便处处都应该像个“重点”的样子，什么都想办，都想“齐头并进”。在城市的规划上，一心想搞得大，搞得新，不注意利用旧城市现有的基础，甚至企图把旧城市完全撇开，一切从平地上新建；而且把摊子铺得很大，把城市建设得很分散，增加了各种市政建设的费用。当然，这些同志的心意是好的，他们的目的是想把人民的生活条件搞得更好，其中有些意见，也确是反映了广大群众的要求。但是，这几种思想情绪都在不同的程度上存在着片面性。他们只看到了我国的城市与资本主义城市不同，是为劳动人民服务的；却忘记了生活的改善必须建立在生产提高的基础上，忘记了如果今天大兴土木，百废俱举，把有限的资金用来普遍地扩建城市，特别是增建电影院、花园和其他较大的工程上面，那么，就会分散国家的资金，损害整个工业化的利益，而没有工业化也就没有了未来的社会主义城市的发展和改造。
    目前城市建设工作必须保证国家的工业建设、为社会主义工业化服务的方针。具体地说，就是必须首先集中力量建设那些有重要工程的新工业城市。这些城市过去没有工业基础，现在要建设大的近代工业，必须有近代的城市公用设施来与之相配合。这类城市应该是我们全部城市建设工作的重点。其次是原来有一定工业基础的近代化城市，现在要在这些城市中扩建和新建许多工厂。这类城市应该放在我国城市建设工作的第二位，随着工业的发展进行必要的改建和扩建。至于第一个五年计划中工业建设不多的某些大城市和一般的中小城市，虽然还有许多旧社会遗留下来的不合理的地方和目前还不能满足人民物质文化生活要求的地方，但这些城市只能进行一般的维护检修，基本上不可能进行新的建设。为了集中力量保证工业建设，就是在各个重点城市中，也应以直接为工业生产服务的道路、上下水道、工人住宅等工程项目作为建设的重点。其他的生活福利设施虽然在做城市规划时必须充分考虑，但在建设的步骤上必须分别轻重缓急，必须随着工业的发展逐步地进行。
    目前我们全国人民的最高利益就是实现国家的社会主义工业化。为此，我们必须从各方面厉行节约，使个人目前的物质文化要求服从于国家工业建设的长远利益。这个精神应该贯串在一切工作中，城市建设工作当然也不应该例外。因此，弄清了这个道理，那些非重点城市中的同志就应该把自己的局部利益服从于国家的整体利益，不要再向国家要求过多的投资来进行城市的改建和扩建；而应该一方面把自己的技术力量尽量抽调出来去支援重点城市，一方面从积极发掘潜力、改进管理入手，在现有条件下积极满足人民的物质文化生活要求。而在那些重点城市中工作的同志，更要进一步明确为工业建设服务的思想，一方面尽量缩减与撙节与生产没有直接关系的各种建设的费用，一方面努力克服困难，积极学习苏联先进经验，极力争取按时做好城市的规划设计和各项重要的市政建设工程，以保证苏联帮助我国设计的一百四十一项重点工程顺利地建设成功。至于广大的城市劳动人民和新工业城市的郊区农民，也应该忍受某些暂时的困难，全力支持和支援国家的社会主义工业建设。只要我们努力这样做去，幸福的美丽的社会主义城市一定会越来越多地在祖国的土地上成长起来。
