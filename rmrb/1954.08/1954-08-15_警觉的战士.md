    The Vigilant Warriors
    It was late at night, and people were already asleep. At the Xu Jia Peng flood control construction site in Wuhan, the flood control team continued to battle the floodwaters. A night breeze blew in gusts, and the floodwaters in the river churned up rolling waves, crashing directly onto the riverbank. At this time, Li Yuting and Chen Mingzhu, administrators from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, were rushing to Xu Jia Peng Street to buy vegetables when they suddenly noticed a figure swaying back and forth to the north of Xu Jia Peng. They immediately thought of what their superiors had repeatedly emphasized: "Be vigilant and prevent special agents from sabotaging the dikes at all times and in all places." So, they immediately chased after him to question him. At first, the fellow pretended to be calm, but later he revealed his true colors. First, he said he was from Shanxi, coming here to find relatives, with 180,000 yuan for travel expenses. Then, realizing he misspoke, he changed his story and said he was from Hebei. When asked what was in his small bag and asked to open it, they found a piece of dark brown dynamite weighing four or five pounds. When the soldiers asked him what it was, the cunning fellow claimed it was sesame candy. Chen Mingzhu then asked him to eat some to try it, but he still prevaricated, saying he wanted to save it for the road tomorrow! After repeated questioning, the fellow finally could not deny it and admitted that he was a Kuomintang special agent attempting to blow up the dike. Finally, he was sent to the local public security police station.

    警觉的战士
    夜深了，人们都已入睡。在武汉徐家棚防汛工地上，防汛队伍继续和洪水搏斗着。晚风阵阵吹来，江中的洪水掀起了滚滚的波浪，直打到江岸上。这时解放军某部管理员李雨廷和陈明珠，正赶到徐家棚街上来买菜，突然，他们发现在徐家棚的北面有一个人影晃来晃去，他们立刻想起了上级一再强调的话：“提高警惕，随时随地防止特务破坏堤防。”于是，他们就马上追了上去盘问，那个家伙开始还故作镇静，以后就露出了马脚，先说他是从山西来这里找亲戚的，带了十八万元路费，以后他自己发现不对头，又改口说是从河北来的。就又问他小包袱里是什么东西，请他打开来看看，结果打开来一看是一块四五斤重的黑褐色炸药。战士们问他这是什么东西，狡猾的家伙还说是芝麻糖，陈明珠就要他吃一点试试看，他还狡赖说：他要留着明天路上吃！经过一再的问讯，最后那家伙无可抵赖，才承认他就是企图爆炸堤防的国民党特务。最后被送到当地公安派出所去了。
