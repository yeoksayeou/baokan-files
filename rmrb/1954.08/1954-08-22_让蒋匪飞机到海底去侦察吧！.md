Let the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Planes Go to the Seabed to Reconnoiter!
Liu Pizhao

    One day, the sky was clear and cloudless, and not a speck of dust moved. Pilot Lin Juncai and his wingman pilot Deng Xiangying were on duty at an airport somewhere along the coast, vigilantly watching the azure sky. Suddenly, a green signal flare pierced the clear sky, indicating that enemy planes were about to sneak in to attack our coastal defenses again. They nimbly jumped into the cockpit and, following the commander's orders, flew in the direction of the enemy plane's intrusion.

    Where were the enemy planes? The vast and boundless ocean, where the sky meets the water, and the water meets the sky. Although the weather on the mainland was clear, it was foggy over the ocean. They made a large rectangular turn, but still did not see the shadow of the enemy plane. Lin Juncai became a little anxious, but he immediately remembered the words that experienced pilots often warned him: "The more anxious you are, the more calm you must be." So they lowered their altitude and searched carefully.

    "Aircraft 'Bear' is over ×× Island, go immediately, go immediately." Following the command post's order, they banked to the left and turned left. On the sea surface south of ×× Island, they discovered a Chiang Kai-shek bandit plane.

    This was a seaplane capable of carrying bombs, as black as the color of the sea, flying at an altitude of about five hundred meters, continuing to penetrate our territorial airspace. Obviously, it was coming to reconnoiter and sabotage our coastal defense facilities.

      "This fellow is really bold, daring to break into the airspace of our great motherland! Well then, please go to the seabed below us to reconnoiter! Our territorial airspace is not a place for you to barge into." A flame of hatred burned in Lin Juncai's chest. He wanted to shoot down the enemy plane immediately, but he did not do so. A pilot's habitual vigilance made him search the surroundings to determine if there were any escorting fighter planes for the enemy.

    At this moment, the enemy plane suddenly lowered its altitude and turned its nose, obviously having discovered our fighter planes and intending to escape.

    "There's no such thing! Come and go as you please? This is not a place for your free passage!" Lin Juncai issued the order to attack, and he and his wingman began to attack the enemy plane.

    The enemy plane panicked, blindly firing its machine guns in all directions, fleeing almost skimming the sea surface. However, it could not escape Lin Juncai's aiming reticle. Closer and closer, the enemy plane's shadow became larger and larger, and the outline became clearer and clearer. Lin Juncai pressed the button, and with the sound of gunfire, the cunning enemy plane banked its fuselage, attempting to hide under Lin Juncai's plane to escape this round. Lin Juncai thought to himself, "You're trying to pull this trick on me? Okay, let's see who's better." He increased the bank angle, dove down, and fired a long burst of cannon fire. The enemy plane, trailing a plume of thick smoke, crashed into the sea! Lin Juncai and Deng Xiangying said with a smile, "The enemy plane has gone deep into our seabed to reconnoiter!"

    让蒋匪飞机到海底去侦察吧！
    刘丕兆
    这一天晴空如洗，风尘不动。飞行员林钧才和他的僚机驾驶员邓相映正在沿海某地机场上值班，他俩警觉地注视着湛蓝的天空。突然，绿色的信号弹划破了晴空，这就是说，敌机又要来偷袭我们的海防了。他俩敏捷地跳进了座舱，按着指挥员的命令，飞向了敌机侵入的方向。
    敌机在哪儿呢！茫茫无边的海洋，天连着水，水连着天。虽然大陆上天气清明，但在海洋上却雾气腾腾，他俩作了一个长方形的大盘旋，仍然没见敌机的影子。林钧才有点焦急起来，但他马上又想起了有经验的飞行员经常告诫他的一句话：“越当你发急的时候，你就越要镇静。”于是他俩降低了一下高度，精细地搜索着。
    “××号‘狗熊’在我××岛的上空，马上去，马上去”。他们按着指挥所的命令向左压了压坡度来了个左转弯，在××岛南侧的海面上，发现了蒋匪飞机。
    这是一架可以挂炸弹的水上侦察机，黑乌乌地像海水的颜色一样，正在大约五百公尺的高度向我们领海上空继续深入飞行着，显然，它是要来侦察和破坏我们海防设备的。
      “这家伙的胆量真不小，居然闯到我们伟大祖国的领空里来了，好吧！请你到我们海底下面去侦察吧！我们的领空可不是你横冲直闯的地方。”一股仇恨的火焰在林钧才的胸中燃烧，他想立刻把敌机揍下海去，但他没有这样做，一个飞行员惯有的警觉使他向周围搜索着，要判定是否还有为敌人护航的驱逐机。
    这时，敌机猛然降低了高度，扭转了机头，显然，他发现了我们的驱逐机，打算逃跑了。
    “哪有这样的事，想来就来，想去就去，这里不是你自由航行的地方！”林钧才发出了攻击的命令，他和他的僚机开始向敌机攻击。
    敌机着慌了，机关枪盲目地向四下发射着，几乎是贴着海面在逃跑。可是，怎也逃不出林钧才瞄准的光圈了。靠近了，敌机的影子越来越大，轮廓越来越清楚了。林钧才把电钮一按，炮声起处，狡猾的敌机把机身一侧，企图躲在林钧才飞机的肚子下逃过这一关。林钧才心中想道：“你和我耍这一手吗？好，咱就比比看。”他把坡度压大了，向下一扣，狠狠地发射了一长串的炮弹，敌机拖着一股浓烟，坠下海去！林钧才和邓相映笑着说道：“敌机深入到我们海底下侦察去了！”
