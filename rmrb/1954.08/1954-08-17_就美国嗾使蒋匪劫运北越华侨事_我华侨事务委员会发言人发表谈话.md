Spokesperson of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Issues Statement Regarding US Instigation of Chiang Kai-shek Bandits to Hijack and Transport Overseas Chinese from North Vietnam

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The spokesperson of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement regarding the US imperialists' instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang stationed in Taiwan to openly plunder and persecute Overseas Chinese in Hanoi, Haiphong, and other places in North Vietnam, and openly dispatching airplanes and ships to hijack and transport our Overseas Chinese compatriots and Overseas Chinese youth students to Taiwan to serve as cannon fodder for the US imperialist's lackey Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang to carry out criminal wars against the people of the motherland. This outrageous crime of US imperialism instigating and supporting the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang to openly kidnap our Overseas Chinese compatriots has aroused extreme indignation among the people of our country and the broad masses of Overseas Chinese.

At the same time, regarding the blatant crime of US imperialism instigating the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang to hijack and transport our Overseas Chinese compatriots, the French side in Hanoi and Haiphong has not taken any measures to prevent it. The people of our country and the broad masses of Overseas Chinese cannot but express regret over this. The people of our entire country and the broad masses of Overseas Chinese are now closely watching this incident.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th, Hanoi News: On the eve of the French army's withdrawal from northern Vietnam, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, under the instigation of US imperialism, is carrying out a conspiracy to hijack and transport Overseas Chinese from the areas of northern Vietnam from which the French army is about to withdraw to southern Vietnam and Taiwan.

In mid-July, when the Indochina ceasefire agreement was about to be signed, US imperialism instigated the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang to send special agents to Haiphong and Hanoi, together with the so-called "consulate" of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang originally stationed in Hanoi, to threaten and intimidate Overseas Chinese, forcing them to leave the North Vietnam where peace was about to arrive, and go to South Vietnam and Taiwan, to be arbitrarily manipulated and driven by the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang. At the same time, US imperialism ordered its notorious Chennault to send planes to step up the hijacking and transportation of Overseas Chinese. At present, this hijacking and transportation work is still in progress.

At the same time as hijacking and transporting Overseas Chinese from North Vietnam, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang is also extorting money from Overseas Chinese in South Vietnam in the name of "relief" for Overseas Chinese in North Vietnam. In Saigon, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang has extorted a large number of Overseas Chinese businessmen, demanding that they be responsible for "raising" huge sums of money or "reducing food donations."

The broad masses of Overseas Chinese resolutely oppose the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang's crime of hijacking and transportation. They realize that the outcome of being hijacked and transported by US imperialism and the Chiang bandit gang is tragic. At the same time, they have increasingly understood and trusted the policies of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to protect the lives and property of foreigners and to protect industry and commerce.

    就美国嗾使蒋匪劫运北越华侨事
    我华侨事务委员会发言人发表谈话
   【新华社十六日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府华侨事务委员会发言人，就美帝国主义嗾使蒋介石残余匪帮劫运北越河内等地华侨事发表谈话如下：
    正当我国旅越侨胞为日内瓦会议达成恢复印度支那和平的协议而欢欣鼓舞的时候，美帝国主义竟嗾使盘据台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮对河内、海防等地的华侨进行公开的掠夺和迫害，并公然派遣飞机、船舰劫运我侨胞和华侨青年学生到台湾去充当美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石残余匪帮对祖国人民进行罪恶战争的炮灰，美帝国主义嗾使和支持蒋介石残余匪帮公然掳掠我侨胞的这一滔天罪行，引起我国人民和国外广大侨胞的极端愤慨。
    同时，对美帝国主义嗾使蒋介石残余匪帮劫运我侨胞的昭彰罪行，河内、海防一带的法国方面竟不加阻止，我国人民和广大华侨对此不能不表示遗憾。我全国人民和广大华侨现正对这一事件予以严密注视中。
   【新华社十六日讯】河内消息：在法军行将撤出越南北部前夕，蒋介石残余匪帮在美帝国主义嗾使下正在进行一项阴谋，把北越法军将要撤出的地区的华侨劫运到南越和台湾去。
    在印度支那停火协定即将签订的七月中旬，美帝国主义即嗾使蒋介石残余匪帮派特务前往海防、河内，会同原驻河内的蒋介石残余匪帮的所谓“领事馆”，对华侨进行威胁和恐吓，迫使他们离开和平即将降临的北越，到南越和台湾去，以供蒋介石残余匪帮任意摆布和驱使。与此同时，美帝国主义即令其臭名远扬的陈纳德派出飞机，加紧劫运华侨。目前，这种劫运工作仍在继续进行中。
    和劫运北越华侨同时，蒋介石残余匪帮并以“救济”北越华侨为名，向南越华侨搜括钱财。在西贡，蒋介石残余匪帮已向广大华侨商人勒索，要他们负责“筹募”巨款或“缩食捐助”。
    广大华侨坚决反对蒋介石残余匪帮的劫运罪行，他们认识到被美帝国主义和蒋匪帮劫运后的结局是悲惨的，同时，他们对越南民主共和国保护外侨的生命财产和保护工商业的政策已愈益了解和信赖。
