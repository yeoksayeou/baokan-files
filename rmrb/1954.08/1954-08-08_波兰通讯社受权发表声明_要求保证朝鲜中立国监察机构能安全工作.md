Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 6th: Regarding the recent provocative actions taken against the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stationed in South Korea, the Polish Press Agency is authorized to issue the following statement:

	The Government of the Polish People's Republic believes that the establishment of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is a major victory for the forces of peace, and proves the correctness of the theory proposed by the peace camp that cooperation between countries with different systems is possible and that international disputes can be resolved through negotiation. The Government of the Polish People's Republic, in sending representatives to participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, firmly believes that this action will help consolidate peace in Korea, thereby helping to further ease international tensions.

	The Polish representatives of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission serve these goals, and they do everything possible to ensure that the Armistice Agreement is observed and implemented.

	However, from the day the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was established, the Syngman Rhee clique, at the instigation of the United States, has been trying to obstruct the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and prevent the implementation of the Armistice Agreement by various means.

	After the end of the Geneva Conference (which facilitated the ceasefire in Indochina and defeated the forces intent on launching a new world war), the ruling groups in the United States and their puppets have intensified this activity in particular.

	There is irrefutable evidence that the threats to the lives of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel in South Korea, the criminal acts of the adventurers under Syngman Rhee who are clearly protected by the police, and the provocative statements of Syngman Rhee's puppets are all carried out under the direction of the United States. For example, the explicit statement made by US Secretary of State Mr. Dulles on August 3rd proves this point. Dulles made it clear that he was in favor of dissolving the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The talks made by the belligerent American senators and generals also prove this point, as they demanded direct aggressive actions in Korea. It is noteworthy that the adventurers of the Syngman Rhee ilk began to act when Syngman Rhee was holding talks in Washington to offset the easing of tensions in the Far East.

	It must be pointed out that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea unanimously adopted a resolution at its meeting on August 4th, expressing deep concern about the events that have occurred and requesting the Military Armistice Commission to require the United Nations Command to take full and effective measures to ensure the safety of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel and normal working conditions. In this way, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has determined that the US side undoubtedly bears the responsibility for ensuring the working conditions of the various institutions of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea. The Government of the Polish People's Republic demands that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, as an institution that helps maintain peace in Korea, be able to carry out its work under fully safe conditions. The representatives of the Polish People's Republic participating in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will continue to work to complete their tasks in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement.

### 波兰通讯社受权发表声明  要求保证朝鲜中立国监察机构能安全工作

    波兰通讯社受权发表声明
    要求保证朝鲜中立国监察机构能安全工作
    【新华社七日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙六日讯：关于最近对驻在南朝鲜的中立国监察委员会中立国视察小组采取的挑衅行动，波兰通讯社受权发表下列声明：
    波兰人民共和国政府认为中立国监察委员会的成立是和平力量的一大胜利，并且证明和平阵营所提出的不同制度的国家之间有可能进行合作以及有可能通过协商来解决国际争端的理论是正确的。波兰人民共和国政府在派遣代表参加中立国监察委员会时坚信它的这种做法有助于巩固朝鲜和平，从而有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势。
    中立国监察委员会的波兰代表们为这些目标而服务，他们尽一切力量确保停战协定得到遵守和履行。
    可是，从中立国监察委员会成立的那天起，李承晚集团就在美国的指使下，企图用各种方法来阻挠中立国监察委员会的工作，阻止停战协定的实施。
    在日内瓦会议结束以后（这个会议促成了印度支那停战，并且使一心想发动新的世界大战的势力遭到失败），美国统治集团和它的傀儡们更特别加紧进行这种活动。
    有一些无可置辩的证据证明：对在南朝鲜的中立国监察委员会人员生命的威胁，李承晚手下的那些显然是受警察掩护的冒险分子的犯罪行为，以及李承晚傀儡们的挑衅性的声明，都是在美方指使之下进行的。例如美国国务卿杜勒斯先生在八月三日所发表的露骨的声明，就证明了这一点。杜勒斯明白地说，他是赞成解散中立国监察委员会的。好战的美国参议员们和将军们所发表的谈话也证明了这一点，他们要求在朝鲜采取直接的侵略行动。耐人寻味的是，李承晚之流的冒险家们开始行动是在李承晚在华盛顿进行会谈以抵消远东紧张局势的缓和的时候。
    必须指出，在朝鲜的中立国监察委员会在八月四日的会议上已一致通过了一项决议，决议中对已发生的事件表示深切的关怀并向军事停战委员会提出要求，要求联合国军司令部采取充分有效措施，保证中立国监察委员会人员的安全和正常工作条件。这样，中立国监察委员会就确定了美方在保证中立国监察委员会各机构在南朝鲜的工作条件方面毫无疑问地负有责任。波兰人民共和国政府要求保证作为有助于维护朝鲜和平的机构的中立国监察委员会能在充分安全的条件下进行工作。参加中立国监察委员会的波兰人民共和国的代表们将继续努力按照停战协定的规定来完成他们的任务。
