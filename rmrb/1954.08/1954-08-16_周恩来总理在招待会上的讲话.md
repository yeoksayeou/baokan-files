Comrade Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

    Today is the ninth anniversary of the liberation of Korea. Allow me to extend warm congratulations and high respect to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and to the heroic Korean people.
    The people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, together with the Chinese People's Volunteers, valiantly defeated the armed intervention of the American aggressors and forced the American aggressors to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement a year ago. In the year since the Korean armistice, the Korean people have been working creatively and have successfully completed the preparatory work for the restoration and development of the people's economy. They are now beginning a large-scale three-year plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy and have achieved remarkable results.
    The traditional and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples has been further consolidated and developed in the common struggle against the American aggressors and in the Korean people's cause of restoring and developing their economy. The Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement concluded between China and Korea in November 1953 marked a significant development in the relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation between the governments and peoples of China and Korea.
    At the Geneva Conference, the delegations of Korea, the Soviet Union, and China made their utmost efforts to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean question. However, mainly due to the vigorous obstruction of the U.S. government, the discussion on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question at the Geneva Conference did not reach an agreement. However, the peaceful settlement of the Korean question has not been removed from the agenda. The people of the world recognize more clearly that the Korean question must be resolved through consultation based on the realization of the Korean people's national rights and the desire for peaceful reunification of Korea. Peace in Asia and the world must be consolidated.
    The Chinese people will certainly continue to provide support and cooperation in all the just struggles waged by the Korean people for this purpose.
    Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!
    Long live the forces of peace headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!
    Please raise your glasses to the health of Marshal Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people!

### 周恩来总理在招待会上的讲话

    周恩来总理在招待会上的讲话敬爱的大使同志，同志们、朋友们：
    今天是朝鲜解放九周年纪念日，让我向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府、向英雄的朝鲜人民致以热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人民同中国人民志愿军一道，英勇地战胜了美国侵略者的武装干涉，在一年以前迫使美国侵略者签订了朝鲜停战协定。朝鲜停战后一年以来，朝鲜人民更以创造性的劳动，胜利地完成了恢复和发展人民经济的准备工作，现在正开始进行大规模的人民经济恢复发展三年计划，并获得了显著的成就。
    中朝两国人民传统的和牢不可破的友谊在共同反对美国的侵略者的斗争中，在朝鲜人民恢复和发展经济事业中，都获得进一步的巩固和发展。一九五三年十一月，中朝两国缔结的经济及文化合作协定，标志着中朝两国政府和人民互助合作关系的重大发展。
    在日内瓦会议上，朝、苏、中三国代表团为了争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，尽了最大的努力，可是主要地由于美国政府的极力阻挠，以致日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论没有达成协议。但是，和平解决朝鲜问题并没有从议程上去掉。全世界人民认识得更清楚：朝鲜问题必须在实现朝鲜人民的民族权利和和平统一朝鲜的愿望的基础上以协商的方法求得解决。亚洲及世界和平必须得到巩固。
    在朝鲜人民为此目的而进行的一切正义的斗争中，中国人民将一定继续给予支持和合作。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    中朝两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平力量万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    请大家举杯祝朝鲜人民领袖金日成元帅的健康！
