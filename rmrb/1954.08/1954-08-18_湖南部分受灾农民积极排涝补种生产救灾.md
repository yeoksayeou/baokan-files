Farmers in flood-stricken areas along the rivers and lakes of Hunan Province, under the leadership of the Party and the government, are working hard to close breaches, restore embankments, drain floodwaters, and rush to plant late rice. Currently, in areas with severe flooding, in addition to actively developing sideline activities locally, there are plans to relocate to nearby mountainous and hilly areas to borrow fields for production and cultivate wasteland. In Tongfu Township, Wangcheng County, the work team leader, Wen Haiyun (a Communist Party member), personally went into the water amidst wind and rain during the embankment restoration and breach closure work, leading the township's farmers to overcome difficulties in their work. The entire township has already planted more than two hundred mu of late rice. The Chen Guoxiang mutual aid team in Baqu Township had their seedlings destroyed by floods twice, but the team members did not lose heart and planted rice seedlings for the third time. Currently, farmers throughout the township are draining water and transplanting rice seedlings. After the breaching of the embankment at the Yuanjiang Common Agricultural Cooperative, most of the cooperative members engaged in various sideline production activities, while a few members took care of the late rice seedlings. Some processed oil for the supply and marketing cooperative, some fished, and some women spun hemp. Their daily income not only covered the living expenses of all forty-five members of the cooperative, both young and old, but also left a surplus. The cooperative has a total of 105 mu of land and plans to plant all of it with late rice after the flood recedes. The Yuanjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also organized the county's first farm and farmers in higher-lying areas to collectively cultivate more than 580,000 jin of late rice seedlings, which will be supplied to farmers in various townships for timely transplanting after the floodwaters recede or the waterlogging is cleared. The Xiangyin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held two expanded cadre meetings to study the issues of production for disaster relief and the relocation of disaster victims, and dispatched cadres to strengthen this work. It also mobilized nine steamships and more than one hundred civilian boats for the use of the disaster victims. Farmers in hilly areas, who had received support from farmers in the lake area during the drought, are also enthusiastically assisting farmers in disaster areas with their relocation and helping them solve difficulties in production. When farmers in Shitan Township, Xiangyin County, heard that farmers in the severely affected Wangjia Township were going to relocate to their township, more than two hundred farmers rushed to the riverbank, more than ten miles away, to greet them, vying to carry luggage and push carts for the Wangjia Township farmers, and giving up their own houses for them to live in. Local farmers are allocating cultivatable wasteland to disaster victims for cultivation, and some farmers have even voluntarily allocated a considerable amount of mature wasteland, and also helped the disaster victims solve problems with tools, sweet potato seedlings, and planting techniques.

    湖南部分受灾农民积极排涝补种生产救灾
    湖南省沿江滨湖遭受水灾地区的农民，在党和政府的领导下，正紧张进行堵口复堤、排渍水、抢种晚稻等工作。目前部分水势较大的地区，除积极在当地展开副业活动外，并有计划转移到邻近山区、丘陵区借田生产和垦荒种植。望城县同福乡在复堤堵口工作中，工作组长文海云（共产党员）冒风雨亲自下水，带动全乡农民克服了工作中的困难，全乡已插上两百多亩晚稻。八曲乡陈国香互助组两次育的秧苗都被洪水淹坏了，但组员们仍不灰心，又插了第三次秧，现全乡农民正在排渍插秧。沅江共同农业社在溃垸后，大部社员进行各项副业生产活动，少数社员照护晚稻秧。有的给供销合作社加工榨油，有的捕鱼，一部分妇女绩麻，每天的收入除供全社大小四十五人的生活费用外，还有剩余。该社共有田一百零五亩，计划在水退后，全部插上晚稻。中共沅江县委会还组织该县第一农场和地势较高地区的农民集体培育五十八万多斤晚稻秧，等到洪水下落或渍水排除后，供给各乡农民及时插上新秧。中共湘阴县委会曾召开两次扩大干部会议，研究了生产救灾和灾民转移的问题，并抽出干部加强这一工作，同时调集了九艘轮船和一百多艘民船，供灾民使用。曾在遭受旱灾时，得到湖区农民支援的丘陵区农民也热情地协助灾区农民转移和帮助他们解决生产中的困难。湘阴县石塘乡农民听说重灾区王家乡农民要转移到本乡来，二百多农民赶到十多里的河边去迎接，争着给王家乡农民挑行李，推车子，让出自己的房子给他们住。本地农民把能够开垦的荒地，让给灾民开，有的农民还自动让出了不少熟荒地，还帮助灾民解决了工具，红薯苗，以及栽种技术上的困难。
