Xinhua News Agency report:

    The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 14th, announcing that the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan will meet in Baguio, Philippines, on September 6th to discuss the establishment of a military bloc initiated by the United States in Southeast Asia.

    Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan also issued identical or similar statements on the same day. Pakistan stated in its statement that its attendance at this meeting does not obligate it to participate in any treaty that may be drafted at the meeting.

    The U.S. announcement of the Baguio meeting to discuss the organization of the Southeast Asia group is the result of a long period of behind-the-scenes activities by the United States. The reason this announcement takes the form of separate statements by the participating countries is to deceive the Asian people, conceal the U.S.'s aggressive intentions, and make them feel as if the organization of this military bloc is not due to U.S. demands, but due to the so-called "common desire" of the countries participating in the bloc.

    However, after more than four months of U.S. conspiracy and instigation, among the eight countries participating in the Baguio meeting, only the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan are Asian countries, and Pakistan has also taken a certain reservation. As such, the Southeast Asia military bloc concocted by the U.S. can actually only be said to be a military bloc dominated by colonial countries in Asian affairs, which is of course intolerable to Asian countries.

    The aggressive essence of the Southeast Asia alliance plan is so obvious that neither the U.S.'s conspiratorial activities nor its deception can eliminate the firm opposition of the people of Asian countries. All self-respecting countries in Southeast Asia have made it clear that they are unwilling to have any connection with this aggressive alliance instigated by the United States. India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon refused to participate in the meeting convened by the United States to discuss the establishment of the Southeast Asia group. The broad public and public opinion in Southeast Asian countries unanimously condemned the U.S. policy of organizing hostile blocs in Asia and using Asians to fight Asians, believing that this policy seriously threatens the peace and security of all countries. The growing anger and accusations of the Southeast Asia group in various countries reflect the common will of the broad masses of Asian people to oppose U.S. aggressive conspiracies. The U.S. authorities' hostile approach to the Asian people and disregard for Asian realities are doomed to new failures.

### 美国宣布将举行拼凑东南亚集团的会议

    美国宣布将举行拼凑东南亚集团的会议
    据新华社讯：美国国务院在十四日发表了一项声明，宣布美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦八国的外交部长将在九月六日在菲律宾的碧瑶举行会议，讨论关于在东南亚建立美国所发起的军事集团的问题。
    英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦也在同一天发表了完全一样的或类似的声明。巴基斯坦在它的声明中并表示，它并不因为出席这个会议而承担参加会议上可能拟成的任何条约的义务。
    美国宣布举行碧瑶会议以讨论组织东南亚集团问题，是美国进行了长时期幕后活动的结果。这一宣布之所以采取参加会议各国分别发表声明的形式，是为了欺骗亚洲人民，掩饰美国的侵略意图，使他们觉得好像组织这个军事集团不是出于美国的要求，而是由于参加这个集团的各国的所谓“共同愿望”。
    但是在美国进行了四个多月的阴谋策动之后，参加碧瑶会议的八个国家之中，只有菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦三个国家是亚洲国家，而且巴基斯坦还采取了一定的保留态度。像这样，美国所搞的东南亚军事集团实际上只能说是殖民国家支配亚洲事务的军事集团，这当然是亚洲国家所不能容忍的。
    东南亚联盟计划的侵略实质是如此明显，因此，不管是美国的阴谋活动或是欺骗，都不能消除亚洲各国人民的坚决反对。东南亚一切有自尊心的国家已明白表示不愿与美国策动的这一侵略性的联盟发生任何关系。印度、印尼、缅甸和锡兰拒绝参加美国召开的讨论成立东南亚集团的会议。东南亚国家的广大公众和各界舆论一致谴责美国在亚洲组织敌对集团、用亚洲人打亚洲人的政策，认为这种政策严重地威胁着各国的和平与安全。各国舆论对于东南亚集团的日益增长的愤怒指责，反映出亚洲广大人民反对美国侵略阴谋的共同意志。美国当局敌视亚洲人民和无视亚洲现实的做法注定了要遭到新的失败。
