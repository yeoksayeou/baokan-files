    A Miracle on the Banks of the Han River
    — Remembering the State-Owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory's Fight Against the Flood
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Ma Guang
    The state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, nestled against Turtle Mountain and facing the Han River, has been surrounded by the floodwaters that have overflowed the Han River channel for over a month. A newly built dike, more than a thousand meters long, defends the factory. The water outside the dike is already more than ten feet higher than the factory grounds.
    However, a miracle has appeared on the banks of the Han River: the workers have not only used the dike to hold back the flood but also continued production as usual under the siege of the flood, exceeding the July production plan.
    With admiration, I visited this factory surrounded by the flood. It was a clear day, and I took a wooden boat towards the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. From afar, I could see the rushing Han River hitting the factory's dike. The water level was about one meter below the top of the dike, and guards stood on the dike monitoring the flood. The dike blocked people's view, and only the roofs of a few tall factory buildings and chimneys emitting steady blue smoke could be seen. To enter the factory, one had to go through a pontoon bridge made of wooden planks. As I bent down and passed through the factory gate, which was four-fifths closed, the scenery immediately changed: there was no mud on the roads inside the factory, the roses by the roadside were in full bloom, and workers' families were playing games with their children on the grass. Inside the workshops, all the machines were running, and people were working in an orderly manner as usual. Loudspeakers broadcast flood prevention ballads composed by the workers.
    Deputy Director Liu Jintang received me in his office. Here is what he told me about their efforts to protect the factory and maintain production.
    In late June, the Wuhan area experienced continuous heavy rain, and the rapidly rising floodwaters quickly reached the front of the factory. At this time, all the factory workers and their families were mobilized, and they wrote letters of determination to protect the factory and participated in the intense voluntary labor of repairing the dike. Female workers, who usually liked to wear skirts, took off their skirts and carried soil and packed it like the male workers. The Ministry of Textile Industry dispatched more than two hundred construction workers from Zhengzhou to provide support, and the Wuhan Municipal Flood Control Headquarters also mobilized residents near the factory to help the factory work overtime overnight. In those days, the water was turbulent, and there were thunderstorms. The workers tirelessly transported soil and tamped it down. By July 10, the dike was built. Afterwards, it was raised several times and constantly reinforced. The factory's flood prevention team took turns guarding and patrolling the dike, and they immediately rescued the situation as soon as a danger was discovered. The factory also installed three water pumps, and the accumulated water in the factory area was drained by the pumps on rainy days.
    After the dike was built, the workers proposed that they must complete the state's production plan. Under the slogan of "supporting flood control with production," they launched a labor competition. It is amazing to say that during this flood prevention period, the attendance rate of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory workers remained above 94 percent. In the past, maintenance workers took more than 50 minutes to repair a machine, but now it only takes 40 minutes, and the fastest is 35 minutes. Fine yarn worker Tian Zehui was unwilling to ask for leave to go back and see her home, which was flooded. She said, "The flood outside the factory is so big, can I leave the factory alone?" Her shoulders were swollen from grinding during dike repair, and in July, she exceeded her production plan every day.
    In July, the factory exceeded its production plan. Since the beginning of August, the workers have continued to complete their work plans evenly. Deputy Director Liu Jintang calculated the accounts. He said: The factory's expenditure on fighting the flood is quite large, but it seems small compared with the profits created for the country by the excess production plan completed by all the factory workers.

    汉水岸上的奇迹
    ——记和洪水搏斗中的国营武汉第一棉纺织厂
    新华社记者　马光
    背靠龟山、面临汉水的国营武汉第一棉纺织厂，被溢出汉水河槽的洪水包围已经一个多月了。新修的一条一千多公尺的堤防捍卫着工厂，堤外的水已经比工厂地面高出一丈多。
    但是，汉水岸上出现了奇迹：工人们不仅用堤防挡住了洪水，并且在洪水的包围下照常生产，超额完成了七月份的生产计划。
    记者怀着钦佩的心情，访问了这个被洪水包围的工厂。这是一个晴朗的日子，记者乘着木船向国棉一厂划去，远远看见急流的汉水冲击着工厂的堤防，水面和堤高相差约有一公尺，警卫战士站在堤上监视着洪水。堤防遮住了人们的视线，只能看见几座高大厂房的屋顶和冒着均匀的青烟的烟囱。进入工厂要经过用木板做成的浮桥。当我弯着腰穿过已经封闭了五分之四的厂门时，眼底景色就立刻改变了：厂里的马路上没有泥泞，路旁的月季花正在盛开，工人家属带着孩子在草地上作游戏。车间里机器全部转动着，人们有条理地在照常工作。扩音器播送着工人编的防汛快板。
    副厂长刘锦堂在他的办公室接见了我。下面是他所讲的他们保卫工厂坚持生产的情形。
    六月下旬，武汉地区连日下大雨，猛涨的洪水很快就冲到了工厂的门前。这时全厂职工和他们的家属都动员起来了，纷纷写下保卫工厂的决心书，参加了紧张的修堤的义务劳动。平素爱穿裙子的女工们，脱下裙子和男工一样挑土、装土。中央纺织工业部从郑州抽调了两百多个建筑工人来支援，武汉市防汛总指挥部也发动工厂附近的居民帮助工厂连夜赶工。那几天水紧浪大，雷雨交加。职工们不知疲劳地运土打夯，到七月十日就把堤筑成了。以后又曾经加高了几次，并且不断加固着。工厂防汛队员轮班地上堤守卫、巡查，一发现有险情就立刻抢救。工厂里还装设了三部抽水机，下雨天厂区里的积水就由抽水机排出去。
    堤修好了，职工们提出一定要完成国家的生产计划，他们在“用生产支援防汛”的口号下，展开了劳动竞赛。说来使人惊佩，在这个防汛期间，国棉一厂职工的出勤率始终保持在百分之九十四以上。保养工人们过去平一台机器要用五十多分钟，现在只用四十分，最快达到三十五分钟。细纱女工田泽惠，家里的房子被淹了也不愿请假回去看看。她说：“厂外的洪水这样大，我能丢开工厂不管吗？”她在修堤中把肩膀都磨肿了，而七月份每天都超额完成了自己的生产计划。
    七月份，这个厂的生产计划是超额完成了。进入八月以来，职工们依然均衡地完成着作业计划。副厂长刘锦堂算了一下账。他说：工厂和洪水搏斗的经费开支相当大，但是它和全厂职工超额完成生产计划为国家创造的利润相对比，却显得小了。
