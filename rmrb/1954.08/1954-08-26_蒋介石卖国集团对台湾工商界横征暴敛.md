Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is intensifying its ruthless levies and exploitation of Taiwan's industrial and commercial circles.

According to the Chiang bandit gang's newspapers, the income from exorbitant taxes and levies of the bandit Taiwan Provincial Government in 1953 increased more than 22 times compared to 1949, and in the first five months of this year, it increased by 22.7 percent compared to the same period last year. Recently, the Chiang bandit gang announced another increase in the tax rates of many taxes. The puppet regimes in Taiwan's towns and cities are also constantly increasing local taxes. For example, in the bandit Taipei Municipal Government's budget for the 1954 fiscal year, tax revenue accounts for 89.89 percent, while in the previous year, it accounted for 69.98 percent.

The Chiang bandit's local newspapers in Taiwan have recently had to admit: "In recent years, various taxes have tended to increase sharply... but on the other hand, the amount of various tax arrears is also constantly increasing." The reason for the tax arrears is primarily "due to the inability to pay, such as taxpayers' deteriorating circumstances, heavy burdens, and inability to pay taxes, which is the most common phenomenon." However, the Chiang bandit gang, accustomed to sucking the marrow from the bones, continues to raise tax rates, forcing a large number of private industrial and commercial enterprises into debt and bankruptcy, or being "sealed up and auctioned" by the puppet courts. Chiang bandit newspapers constantly publish announcements and news of factories and shops being "sealed up and auctioned" by the puppet courts for violating "tax laws." According to statistics from the bandit Taiwan Provincial Department of Finance, there were more than 220,000 "tax-related cases of violations and arrears not yet cleared" in Taiwan last year.

Chiang bandit tax collectors often cooperate with bandit armed police to coerce the industrial and commercial circles in order to collect taxes, placing industrial and commercial figures in constant danger of being "sentenced to imprisonment" and having their property "sealed up and auctioned." Recently, due to the "large number of delinquent accounts," the Chiang bandit gang dispatched puppet tax officials to cooperate with a large number of bandit military police to "launch a full-scale tax collection campaign." The puppet tax authorities also took the opportunity to embezzle and extort, using pretexts such as "calculation and copying errors" to repeatedly demand payment from "tax delinquent households" even after they had paid. This vicious method of "full-scale tax collection" by the Chiang bandit gang has aroused the anger and resistance of Taiwan's industrial and commercial circles. In Taipei City, many "tax delinquent households" simply ignore the pile of chaotic "old arrears" and "new levies" tax bills sent by the bandit tax collection agencies. Chiang bandit newspapers have even admitted that puppet tax officials have been beaten by angry members of the public.

Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: Taiwan's private industry and commerce are being squeezed and attacked by Chiang bandit bureaucrat capital. Chiang bandit local newspapers in Taiwan recently revealed a vivid example: Some privately-owned small factories in Taiwan that manufacture caustic soda used imported soda ash as raw material to make caustic soda in order to compete with a caustic soda company owned by bureaucrat capital. Because the price of the products manufactured in this way was lower than that of the caustic soda produced by the bureaucrat capital company, the Chiang bandit gang prohibited the import of soda ash. The private factories were forced to use imported baking soda to reduce it to soda ash and then make caustic soda. Sales still overwhelmed the caustic soda of the bureaucrat capital company, so the Chiang bandit gang prohibited the import of baking soda. After this forced a large number of private caustic soda factories to be unable to produce and went bankrupt or stopped work, the Chiang bandit bureaucrat caustic soda company monopolized the production of caustic soda and sold it at extremely high prices, causing private factories that needed caustic soda as a raw material to complain endlessly.

    蒋介石卖国集团对台湾工商界横征暴敛
    【新华社二十四日讯】蒋介石卖国集团正在变本加厉地向台湾工商界横征暴敛。
    据蒋匪帮报刊透露，匪台湾省政府的苛捐杂税款项的收入，一九五三年比一九四九年增加二十二倍以上，今年头五个月又比去年同期增加百分之二十二点七。最近蒋匪帮又宣布再次提高许多捐税的税率。台湾各市镇伪政权也不断增加地方捐税。例如，匪台北市政府一九五四年度的岁入预算中，税收占百分之八十九点八九，而上年度占百分之六十九点九八。
    蒋匪台湾地方报纸最近也不得不承认：“近年来各项课税趋激增，……但在另一方面，各种欠税的数额亦在不断增加。”而欠税的原因首先是“由于无力缴纳，如纳税人境遇转劣，负担甚重，无力纳税，这是最普遍的现象”。但是，惯于敲骨吸髓的蒋匪帮却仍然不断提高税率，迫使大批私营工商企业负债倒闭或被伪法院“查封拍卖”。蒋匪报纸不断刊载工厂、商店因违反“税法”而被伪法院“查封拍卖”的公告和消息。单据匪台湾省财政厅统计，去年台湾“违章及滞纳尚未清理的税务案件”就有二十二万多起。
    蒋匪税收人员为催收税款，经常配合匪武装警察，对工商界进行胁迫，使工商界人士随时面临着被“判刑坐牢”和产业被“查封拍卖”的危险。最近蒋匪帮由于“欠户众多”，派遣伪税务人员配合大批匪军警“发动全面催征”，伪税务机关也乘机贪污勒索，以“计算抄缮讹误”等为托词，常常对
  “欠税户”收了又催。蒋匪帮这种“全面催征”的凶恶手段，引起了台湾工商界的愤怒反抗，在台北市，不少“欠税户”把匪税收机关送来的一大堆混乱的“旧欠”“新捐”税单搁置不理。蒋匪帮报纸并且承认有过伪税务人员被愤怒的公众殴打的事实发生。
      【新华社二十四日讯】台湾私营工商业受到蒋匪官僚资本的排挤和打击。台湾蒋匪地方报纸最近透露了一个活生生的例子：台湾一些制造烧碱的民营小厂，为了和一家官僚资本的烧碱公司竞争，用进口纯碱为原料来制烧碱。由于这样制造出来的产品价格，较官僚资本公司的烧碱为低，蒋匪帮就禁止纯碱进口。民营工厂迫不得已，改用进口小苏打还原为纯碱再制成烧碱，销路仍压倒官僚资本公司的烧碱，于是蒋匪帮又禁止小苏打进口。这样迫使大批民营烧碱厂无法生产纷纷倒闭或停工后，蒋匪官僚烧碱公司就垄断了烧碱的生产，以极高的价钱出售，使其他需用烧碱为原料的民营工厂叫苦连天。
