    1954 National Swimming Competition Concludes Successfully
      The 1954 National Swimming Competition concluded successfully on the 28th, after four days and seven sessions of intense competition. Over 100,000 spectators watched the competition over the days.
      The results of this competition demonstrate that the level of swimming in our country has significantly improved. In all twenty-two events of the competition, eleven events saw thirty-nine individuals and eight teams break the national record; another five events broke the records of the 1952 National Swimming Competition. In the events where our country previously had no records: the men's 400-meter breaststroke, the men's 200-meter butterfly, the men's 400-meter medley relay, and the women's 400-meter medley relay, exciting national records were created at this competition.
      At the competition, worker, peasant, and soldier athletes were exceptionally active. In the twenty-two competition events, athletes from the Chinese People's Liberation Army team won first place in fourteen events and set five new records. Liang Shumei, an outstanding female athlete from the Central-South region and a construction worker by origin, broke three national records. Tan Zhixiong, an athlete from the Central-South region team and a peasant by origin, also broke the national record for the men's 1,500-meter freestyle.
    The competition was filled with a new sporting spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and humble learning from beginning to end. The hard work, diligent training, and collectivist spirit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army team have become a model for all teams to emulate. Each team also established specific guarantees for mutual learning, avoiding arrogance in victory and discouragement in defeat, working together to create higher achievements for the motherland.
    The participation and performance of the Soviet swimming team added much brilliance to this competition. The excellent techniques of the outstanding Soviet swimmers left an unforgettable impression on the audience. From the day of their arrival in Guangzhou, the Soviet athletes enthusiastically imparted their advanced technical knowledge to the Chinese athletes. Many of our athletes improved their skills rapidly with the help of the Soviet athletes. The competition was filled with the profound friendship between Chinese and Soviet athletes from beginning to end.
    The closing ceremony was held at 10:00 PM on the 28th. Du Guoxiang, Chairman of the Presidium of the competition and Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government Sports Commission, delivered the closing speech. He warmly congratulated the success of the competition and, on behalf of the competition, thanked the Soviet swimming team for their tireless assistance. Du Guoxiang said that the achievements of this competition demonstrated the rapid development of water sports in our country and also reflected the rapid rise of our cultural and scientific level. He emphasized that today, our people are facing the task of liberating Taiwan and strengthening the defense of our national coastal areas, making the development of swimming more significant. He called on all sports workers and athletes to work harder in the future and strive for the further popularization and improvement of swimming in our country. N. N. Bugrov, the leader of the Soviet swimming team, delivered a speech congratulating the success of the competition. Subsequently, the competition awarded prizes and certificates to the winning athletes and those who set new records. Soviet athletes also presented flowers to outstanding Chinese athletes. After the closing ceremony, the South China Sea Fleet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army performed a wonderful water sports demonstration.
