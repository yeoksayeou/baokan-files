According to statistics from Zhengding, Jin, Xingtang, Anping, and other counties, the yield per mu can reach 180 jin, an increase of 27 percent over the original planned per-unit area yield. The entire district is now nearing completion of the harvest. Farmers are busy rushing to plant buckwheat and vegetables, and some areas are intensively preparing the land and transporting fertilizer to prepare for timely sowing of autumn wheat.

    石家庄专区玉米丰收
    河北省石家庄专区六十余万亩春玉米获得丰收。据正定、晋县、行唐、安平等县统计，每亩可产一百八十斤，比原计划单位面积产量增产百分之二十七。目前全区已快收割完毕。农民正在忙着抢种荞麦、蔬菜，有些地区正紧张进行整地送肥准备适时播种秋麦。　		（李化章）
