Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 21st: The spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on August 20th regarding the conspiracy of the US ruling circles to "dissolve" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

In his statement, the spokesperson cited the recent open attacks, insults, and threats against personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea by the Syngman Rhee gang under the manipulation of the United States. He pointed out that this is part of the pre-determined plan of the US ruling circles to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, plan new military adventures, and continue to create international tensions. US Secretary of State Dulles stated at a press conference on August 3rd that "the United States agrees to terminate the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission," and said, "The question is how to terminate the activities of the Supervisory Commission." This proves that this series of provocative and criminal actions by the Syngman Rhee gang was planned by the US ruling circles.

The spokesperson said: It is quite obvious that these consecutive incidents in South Korea are the first step in the US ruling circles' attempt to "dissolve" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement. US Secretary of State Dulles arbitrarily claimed that the part of the Armistice Agreement concerning the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission could be separated from the Korean Armistice Agreement and regarded as invalid. However, the provisions concerning the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, together with all other provisions of the Armistice Agreement, are an inseparable part of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Its illegal destruction will inevitably lead to the destruction of the Armistice Agreement itself.

The spokesperson pointed out that, according to reports from US news agencies, the outcome of the recent talks between the US ruling circles and Syngman Rhee in Washington stipulates that the United States will further increase military assistance to South Korea and transport various war materials to South Korea on a larger scale in order to greatly expand the Syngman Rhee puppet army. This situation makes the United States and Syngman Rhee even more impatient and fanatical in disrupting and canceling the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea.

The spokesperson refuted Dulles' slander and libel against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Korean-Chinese side, pointing out that it is the US side that has hindered the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from working more effectively and seriously violated the Armistice Agreement. The consistent adherence of the Korean-Chinese side to the Armistice Agreement has been fully proven by the resolutions and decisions of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the reports of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in the north.

The spokesperson said: The Korean people, who desire peace in Korea and the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and peace-loving people all over the world will never allow the US ruling circles' conspiracy to undermine the Korean armistice to succeed. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will firmly implement its peaceful policy, strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and continue to strive, first and foremost, to transform the Korean armistice into a consolidated peace.

The spokesperson expressed full support for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's request to the Military Armistice Commission that the United Nations Command take effective measures to ensure the safety of the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the normal working conditions of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. He also pointed out that, according to the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its inspection teams should be given full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation, the US side must immediately stop instructing the Syngman Rhee gang to attempt to undermine the Armistice Agreement, and must bear full responsibility for the illegal actions of insulting and threatening the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the consequences arising therefrom.

    就美国企图“解散”中立国监察委员会的阴谋
    朝鲜外务省发言人发表谈话
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人八月二十日就美国统治集团企图“解散”中立国监察委员会的阴谋发表谈话。
    发言人在他的谈话中举出了最近李承晚匪帮在美国的操纵下在南朝鲜对中立国监察委员会人员所进行的公开袭击事件和侮辱、威胁行为，指出这是美国统治集团企图破坏朝鲜停战协定、策划新的军事冒险、继续制造国际紧张局势的预定计划的一部分。美国国务卿杜勒斯八月三日在记者招待会上声称“美国赞同终止中立国监察委员会的活动”，并且说“问题在于用什么办法来终止监察委员会的活动”。这证明了：李承晚匪帮这一系列挑衅性罪恶行动，是美国统治集团所策划的。
    发言人说：十分明显，在南朝鲜接连发生的这些事件是美国统治集团企图“解散”中立国监察委员会，破坏朝鲜停战协定的第一步。美国国务卿杜勒斯武断地声称停战协定中规定的关于中立国监察委员会的那一部分条款，可以和朝鲜停战协定分开，可以作为无效。但是，关于中立国监察委员会的条款，和停战协定另外的一切条款一起，都是朝鲜停战协定的不可分割的部分。对它的非法破坏，必将带来破坏停战协定本身的结果。
    发言人指出，据美国通讯社报道，这次美国统治集团和李承晚在华盛顿举行的会谈的结果，规定美国进一步增加对南朝鲜的军事援助，为了大大地扩张李承晚傀儡军队，而更大规模地往南朝鲜运入各种战争物资。这种情况使美国和李承晚更加急躁地和热狂地破坏和取消中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜的工作。
    发言人驳斥了杜勒斯对中立国监察委员会和朝中方面的中伤和诽谤，指出阻碍中立国监察委员会更有效地工作，并严重违反了停战协定的，正是美方。而朝中方面的始终一贯遵守停战协定，是中立国监察委员会历次的决议、决定和北部的中立国视察小组的报告所完全证明了的。
    发言人说：愿望朝鲜和平和祖国和平统一的朝鲜人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民将绝不容许美国统治集团企图破坏朝鲜停战的阴谋得逞。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府将坚定地执行自己的和平政策，为祖国的和平统一而奋斗，并首先为把朝鲜停战转变为巩固的和平而继续奋斗。
    发言人表示完全支持中立国监察委员会向军事停战委员会提出的、要求联合国军采取有效措施、以保障中立国监察委员会成员的安全和中立国视察小组正常的工作条件的要求，并且指出，根据朝鲜停战协定应给予中立国监察委员会及其视察小组充分保护及一切可能的协助与合作的规定，美方必须立即停止指使李承晚匪帮企图破坏停战协定的行为，必须对侮辱和威胁中立国监察委员会人员的非法行动和由此而产生的后果负完全的责任。
