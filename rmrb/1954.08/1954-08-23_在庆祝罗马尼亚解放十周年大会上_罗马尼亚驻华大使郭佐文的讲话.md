Comrade Vice Chairman, esteemed Comrade Premier, esteemed Ambassadors, dear Comrades and Friends:

August 23, 1954, is the day the Romanian people celebrate the tenth anniversary of the heroic Soviet army's liberation of Romania and the tenth anniversary of the Romanian patriotic forces, under the organization and leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, overthrowing the fascist dictatorship.

The Soviet Union's historic victory in World War II created favorable conditions for the people of many countries, including the Romanian people, to take control of their own destiny and establish a truly democratic regime. Under these conditions, the vanguard of Romanian workers arrested the head of the fascist government, achieving the victory of August 23, 1944. The Romanian army, which had long resented the fascist occupiers, turned its guns on the Hitler fascists, cooperating with the Soviet army in the battle, first to liberate Romania, and then to liberate Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

Thanks to the Soviet army's liberation of the Romanian people, the Romanian people gained true national independence for the first time.

The Soviet army liberated the Romanian people. This not only brought national liberation to the Romanian people, but also created the conditions for the working class to unite with the peasants and, with the support of the working people of the whole country, to seize power.

The broad masses of the people struck at the reactionaries' attempts to obstruct the country's democratic reforms, overthrew the reactionary government, and established a democratic government led by the working class.

In the face of the country's serious war wounds, the working people in cities and villages launched a vigorous movement to overcome economic bankruptcy, drought, inflation, sabotage by the reactionaries, and other difficulties.

In those difficult years, when the wounds of war were still very serious, the Soviet people sent us food, saving various regions from famine, and provided us with raw materials to revitalize Romania's industry. This assistance was very practical.

The old bourgeois and landlord parties and domestic reactionaries were completely exposed as traitorous and anti-people organizations, which made it possible to overthrow the bourgeois regime and establish the Romanian People's Republic.

The proclamation of the Romanian People's Republic meant that the Romanian working class, in alliance with the peasants, had completely seized power.

Since its founding, the Romanian people have resolutely embarked on the bright road of building a socialist economic base.

Today, the Romanian people celebrate the tenth anniversary of their motherland's liberation as they struggle to implement the first Five-Year Plan, to advance the national economy towards socialism, and to improve the people's living standards.

Summing up the achievements of the ten years since liberation vividly illustrates how great the construction power of the people is once they break the chains of exploitation and become masters of their country.

The people's democratic state has carried out enormous construction work in economic and cultural fields to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the broad working people.

In these years, with the people in power, industrial output has far exceeded the highest record of the old government era. In 1953, industrial output was almost three times that of 1938 and 3.5 times that of 1948. The heavy industry, especially the machinery industry, established by the people's regime in recent years, continues to expand. In Romania, countless factories and enterprises have been installed with domestically manufactured machinery and equipment, which is a first. Emerging industries, such as machine tool manufacturing, electrical industry, oil and coal mining equipment manufacturing, tractor and agricultural machinery manufacturing, have been established.

National electrification is being implemented step by step. In 1953, electricity production increased to three times that of 1938. Four huge thermal and hydroelectric power stations have been completed; the Lenin Hydropower Station is under active construction. In 1953, the output of the electrical industry increased thirteen times compared to 1948. The number of construction projects is growing at an astonishing rate; it increased four times in 1950 compared to 1948, and increased by an average of 35 percent per year between 1950 and 1953.

Thanks to the assistance of the Soviet Union and the contributions of the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, and the Hungarian People's Republic, the great project of the Danube Bridge has recently been completed; this bridge symbolizes the friendship between the Romanian and Bulgarian people and demonstrates the new friendly relations between countries in the democratic camp.

The consumer goods industry is constantly developing. The government took new measures in 1953, and the production volume of major consumer goods has increased significantly. In the three quarters after the enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party in August 1953, bread production increased by about 5 percent, flour products by 7.2 percent, canned meat by 21.8 percent, and confectionery by 41.8 percent.

In the years since the people took power, the lives of working peasants have undergone great changes. The land reform eliminated the land ownership of landlords; the government continuously supplied the needs of working peasants with various agricultural machinery, tractors and other equipment, with selected seeds, low-interest loans, and cheap industrial products; the state's policy restricted the exploitation of rich peasants - all this has continuously improved the living standards of working peasants.

Many farm households have formed 2,045 collective farms and 2,334 mutual aid teams on a voluntary basis. The people's democratic regime provides collective farms and mutual aid teams with strong assistance, enabling them to produce large quantities of marketable grain, livestock, and other goods.

The achievements in the development of the national economy have led to a steady increase in national income. In the first half of 1954, the average income of workers increased by 15 percent compared to the first half of 1953.

Expenditure on social and cultural undertakings in the budget has increased year by year. In the 1954 budget, this expenditure accounted for 15.9 percent.

The government has also allocated large sums of money to improve working conditions in enterprises, and for labor safety equipment and to protect workers' health.

The working people enjoy the right to free medical care, and malaria and other epidemics have been eradicated. Today, the number of pharmacies is four times that of 1948. Maternal and child health care institutions are constantly expanding. In 1944, there was not a single maternity hospital, while currently there are 1,348. The number of nurseries in 1954 has increased more than four times compared to 1949.

In the past ten years, the development of education, culture, and art in our country has reached a climax. The treasures of culture have become the common property of the people.

Illiteracy is about to be eliminated. The number of secondary school students in 1953 was 361 percent of that in 1938; the number of students in various universities and colleges in 1953 was 298 percent of that in 1938.

Giant cultural and sports buildings, such as the J.V. Stalin Printing Factory, the Bucharest Opera and Ballet Theater, the Radio Broadcasting Building, the Bufcea Film Studio, the "'August 23' Stadium", the Dynamo Sports Association headquarters, etc., have been completed.

The circulation of newspapers is currently five times that of 1938. The number of libraries, museums, theaters, symphony orchestras, and cinemas has increased several times compared to the number in 1938. Even in the most remote rural areas, there are cultural clubs, libraries, art groups, and choirs.

Our country's literature and art have played a positive role in the people's struggle for the victory of socialism. They are closely linked to the fate of the people, and therefore they are warmly loved by the people.

The working people of the Romanian People's Republic fully enjoy extensive rights and freedoms, which demonstrates the most democratic essence of the people's regime. The strength of the people's democratic state lies in the fact that the broad masses have a high degree of awareness and actively participate in the country's political life. More than 135,000 Romanian working people have been elected as representatives to people's congresses at all levels, tens of thousands of working people have been elected as people's assessors, and tens of thousands of working people have become members of street committees and other permanent citizens' committees; they are all participating in the management of public affairs.

The elimination of national oppression and discrimination and the guarantee of complete equal rights for men and women have further strengthened the political and moral unity of the Romanian working people. The foreign policy of the Romanian People's Republic demonstrates our people's desire for peace; it is a policy of defending peace, a policy of maintaining friendly alliance relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, and a policy of maintaining friendship with all peace-loving people.

The foreign policy of the Romanian People's Republic is based on its unbreakable alliance and friendship with the great Soviet Union, guaranteeing our country's national independence and the victory of domestic socialist construction. In addition to political and diplomatic support, the Soviet Union has provided us with substantial economic assistance, which is mainly manifested in: foreign trade, scientific and technological assistance, the development of national resources, the exchange of scientific, technological, and production experience, loans, cadre training, etc.

The Romanian people, in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, are striving to implement the principles of international cooperation initiated by the Soviet Union, namely, to resolve international disputes through consultation and ease international tensions; to strive for peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems.

Our people and government warmly congratulate the achievements of the Geneva Conference, which signifies the brilliant victory of the forces of peace and the miserable defeat of the forces of war.

The government of the Romanian People's Republic recently issued a statement on the results of the Geneva Conference. The statement said: "The Geneva Conference proves that the U.S. aggressive bloc is becoming increasingly isolated internationally, and their actions are not to work together with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, France, the United Kingdom, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to end the bloody war in Indochina, but to plot to undermine the restoration of peace."

"The Geneva Conference proves how necessary and beneficial it is to recognize the right of the People's Republic of China to be a member of the United Nations Organization and to recognize the important role of the great Chinese people in resolving international issues and consolidating world peace. The policy adopted by the United States towards the great People's Republic of China is a policy that undermines peace and completely contradicts the fundamental interests of mankind."

The fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Romanian people and the great Chinese people is unbreakable. The brilliant achievements that the Chinese people have already made and are continuing to make in building their motherland into a strong socialist country make our people rejoice and strengthen their confidence in the victory of peace and socialism.

The economic, technological, scientific, and cultural cooperation between our two countries is being strengthened and expanded day by day.

The trade relations between our two countries began to be established after the founding of the People's Republic of China and have developed year by year.

The Sino-Romanian Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement is a powerful proof of the friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries.

The Romanian people are extremely fond of the Chinese people's cultural and artistic creations. The deep impression left by the Chinese Cultural and Arts Troupe and the exhibition in the hearts of our people, the popularity of Romanian translations of Chinese literary works and film translations, and the popularity of Chinese songs - all these show the close friendly relations between the two peoples.

Continuing to strengthen and expand the friendly economic and cultural relations between the countries of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union is an important factor in defending peace.

The Romanian People's Republic has also widely expanded economic relations with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In the period from 1950 to 1953 alone, the Romanian People's Republic expanded its trade volume with Western European countries by 50 percent. In 1953, it conducted trade with 44 capitalist countries. In 1954, it signed a number of trade agreements with countries including India, Indonesia, Egypt, Denmark, Turkey, Iceland, Norway, Austria, and Greece.

At the same time, the Romanian People's Republic unswervingly encourages cultural exchanges with all countries in order to promote the cause of peace and international cooperation.

The consistent foreign policy of the Romanian People's Republic is based on the principles of international cooperation and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, opposing the division of the world into hostile blocs, opposing the arms race, and supporting collective security.

Therefore, the Romanian government has repeatedly declared its determination to cooperate with European countries in concluding the all-European treaty guaranteeing European collective security initiated by the Soviet Union, which has special significance for maintaining and consolidating world peace.

Now, as the Romanian people celebrate the achievements made in ten years of free life, they are filled with confidence in the victory of the cause of world peace, which has greatly encouraged their determination to build a new life.

Comrades, before concluding my speech, please allow me to express the Romanian government's and my personal gratitude to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China for its kindness in holding this celebration this evening.

Long live the great Soviet Union - the liberator of Romania!

Long live the unbreakable, fraternal friendship between the Romanian and Chinese people!

Long live the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the peace forces of the world! Long live world peace!

    在庆祝罗马尼亚解放十周年大会上
    罗马尼亚驻华大使郭佐文的讲话尊敬的副主席同志、尊敬的总理同志、各位大使先生、亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    一九五四年八月二十三日，是罗马尼亚人民庆祝英勇的苏军解放罗马尼亚十周年，庆祝罗马尼亚的爱国部队在罗马尼亚工人党组织和领导之下推翻法西斯专政十周年的纪念日。
    苏联在第二次世界大战中的历史性的胜利，给许多国家的人民（包括罗马尼亚人民在内）为掌握自己的命运和建立真正的民主政权，创造了有利条件。在这些条件下，罗马尼亚工人先锋队逮捕了法西斯政府的首脑，获得了一九四四年八月二十三日的胜利。罗马尼亚军队对法西斯占领者痛恨已久，把矛头指向希特勒法西斯分子，配合苏军作战，首先为解放罗马尼亚、接着又为解放捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利而战斗。
    由于苏联军队解放了罗马尼亚人民，罗马尼亚人民第一次获得了真正的民族独立。
    苏联军队解放了罗马尼亚。这不仅使罗马尼亚人民得到民族解放，同时为工人阶级创造了前提，使他们能够联合农民在全国劳动人民的支持下，获得政权。
    广大人民群众打击了反动派阻挠国家实行民主改革的企图，推翻了反动政府，建立了一个由工人阶级占领导地位的民主政府。
    在国家战争创痕的严重情况下，城市和乡村的劳动人民展开了一个轰轰烈烈的运动，来克服经济破产、旱灾、通货膨胀、反动派的破坏等种种困难。
    在这些艰难的岁月里，当战争创伤还很严重，苏联人民把粮食送给我们，使各地区得免于饥馑，又把原料供给我们，来振兴罗马尼亚的工业，这种援助是很切合实际的。
    旧的资产阶级、地主的政党和国内反动派整个暴露了他们是卖国的、反人民的组织，这才有推翻资产阶级政权、建立罗马尼亚人民共和国的可能。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的宣告成立，意味着与农民结成联盟的罗马尼亚工人阶级完全掌握了政权。
    开国以来，罗马尼亚人民坚决地走上了建立社会主义经济基础的光明大道。
    今天罗马尼亚人民庆祝祖国解放十周年，它是在为实施第一个五年计划，为发展国民经济向社会主义迈进，并为了提高人民生活水平而进行奋斗。
    总结一下解放以后十年来的成就，可以生动地说明人民一旦打断剥削的锁链，做了国家的主人，他们的建设力量是怎么的巨大。
    人民民主国家在经济和文化各方面进行了巨大的建设工作，以满足广大劳动人民不断增长的物质和文化方面的需要。
    这几年来，人民掌握了政权，工业产量远远超过旧政府时代的最高纪录。一九五三年工业产量几乎达到一九三八年的三倍，为一九四八年的三·五倍。几年来人民政权所建立的重工业特别是机械工业，正继续不断地扩大。在罗马尼亚，无数的工厂企业用本国制造的机器和装备安装起来，这还是第一次。新兴的工业，如工作母机制造工业、电气工业、石油和煤矿设备制造工业、拖拉机和农业机械制造工业，都已建立起来。
    国家电气化正在着着实施中。一九五三年电力产量增加为一九三八年的三倍。四所巨大的火力和水力发电站已经落成；列宁水电站正在积极兴建中。一九五三年电气工业的产量比一九四八年增加了十三倍。建筑工程的数量正以惊人的速度飞快地增长；一九五○年比一九四八年增加了四倍，在一九五○年和一九五三年之间，每年平均增加百分之三十五。
    由于苏联的协助以及波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国和匈牙利人民共和国的贡献，多瑙河大桥的伟大工程已于最近完成；这座桥象征着罗马尼亚与保加利亚人民之间的友谊，表现出民主阵营中各国之间的新的友好关系。
    消费品工业在不断地发展着。政府在一九五三年采取了新的措施，主要消费品的生产量有了显著的提高。在一九五三年八月罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会举行扩大全体会议以后的三个季度中，面包产量约增加百分之五，面粉制品百分之七·二，罐头肉百分之二一·八，糖果百分之四一·八。
    在人民掌握政权的各年中，劳动农民的生活有了很大的变化。土地改革消灭了地主的土地所有制；政府以各式各样的农业机械、拖拉机和其他装备，以选种、低利的贷款、廉价的工业品不断供应了劳动农民的需要；国家的政策限制了富农的剥削——这一切都使得劳动农民的生活水平不断提高了。
    许许多多的农户已经根据自愿原则，组成了二、○四五个集体农庄和二、三三四个共耕互助社。人民民主政权给予集体农庄和共耕互助社以大力的帮助，使他们能大量生产商品粮食、牲畜及其他物品。
    国民经济的发展中所获得的成就，使国家收入有了稳步的增长。在一九五四年的上半年，工人的平均收入较一九五三年的上半年就增加了百分之十五。
    预算中社会文化事业费已逐年增加。在一九五四年度的预算中，这项经费占百分之十五·九。
    政府在改善企业中的劳动条件方面，在劳动安全设备和保障工人健康方面也拨了大批的款项。
    劳动人民享有免费医疗的权利，疟疾和其他流行病已被扑灭了。今天药房的数目为一九四八年的四倍。妇幼保健机构正在不断扩大。一九四四年一所产科医院也没有，而目前则已有了一千三百四十八所。托儿所的数目，一九五四年比一九四九年增加四倍以上。
    在过去十年中，我国的教育、文化和艺术的发展达到了高潮。文化的宝藏成为人民大众所共有的财产。
    文盲已快消灭了。一九五三年度的中学生人数，为一九三八年度的百分之三六一；一九五三年度各高等学校学生人数，则为一九三八年度的百分之二九八。
    文化与体育方面的巨型建筑物，如约·维·斯大林印刷厂、布加勒斯特歌剧和巴蕾舞剧院、无线电广播大楼、布弗切阿电影制片厂、“‘八月二十三日’运动场”、狄纳莫体育协会会址等等，都已落成了。
    报纸的发行量目前为一九三八年的五倍。图书馆、博物馆、剧院、交响乐团和电影院的数字，都比一九三八年的数字增加了好几倍。甚至在最偏僻的农村里也有了文化俱乐部、图书室、艺术小组和歌咏队了。
    我国的文学与艺术，在人民争取社会主义的胜利的斗争中，起了积极的作用。它们是和人民的命运结合在一起的，因此它们为人民所热烈喜爱。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的劳动人民充分地享受着广泛的权利和自由，这种情形表现出人民政权的最民主的本质。人民民主国家之所以强大，就是由于广大群众都有高度的觉悟，都积极参加国家的政治生活。十三万五千以上的罗马尼亚劳动人民已被选为各级地方人民会议的代表，数万劳动人民已被选为人民陪审员，还有数万个劳动人民当了街道委员会和其他永久性的公民委员会的委员；他们都在参加着管理公共事务。
    民族压迫与歧视的政策的消灭以及男女完全享有平等权利的保证，更加强了罗马尼亚劳动人民在政治上和道义上的团结。罗马尼亚人民共和国的外交政策表明了我国人民渴望和平的志愿，它是一个保卫和平的政策，与苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家保持友好同盟关系的政策，与一切爱好和平的人民保持友谊的政策。
    在罗马尼亚人民共和国外交政策的基础上，建立了它与伟大的苏联牢不可破的联盟和友谊，保证了我国的民族独立和国内社会主义建设的胜利。苏联除了政治上和外交上的支持外，还给予我们大量的经济援助，这主要表现于：对外贸易，科学与技术的援助，国家资源的开发，科学、技术和生产经验的交流，贷款，干部训练等等。
    罗马尼亚人民在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营中，正在为贯彻苏联倡议的国际合作的原则，即以协商的方式解决国际争端、缓和国际紧张局势而奋斗；为争取与不同社会制度的国家和平共处而奋斗。
    我国人民和政府热烈祝贺日内瓦会议所取得的成就，这项成就意味着和平力量的光辉胜利，战争势力的惨败。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国政府最近就日内瓦会议的结果发表了声明。声明说：“日内瓦会议证明，美国侵略集团在国际上愈来愈孤立了，他们的行动不是与苏联、中华人民共和国、法国、英国、越南民主共和国共同努力来结束印度支那的流血战争，而是阴谋破坏和平的恢复。”
    “日内瓦会议证明，承认中华人民共和国作为联合国组织的一个成员国的权利和承认伟大的中国人民在解决国际问题以及巩固全世界和平方面的重要作用是多么必要和有益的。美国对伟大的中华人民共和国所采取的政策是破坏和平的、完全和人类的基本利益相矛盾的政策。”
    罗马尼亚人民与伟大的中国人民间兄弟般的友谊和合作是牢不可破的。中国人民要把祖国建设成一个强大的社会主义国家，他们所已取得并正在不断取得的光辉成就，使我国人民欢欣鼓舞，并对和平和社会主义事业的胜利增强了信心。
    我们两国间的经济、技术、科学和文化合作，正在日新月异地加强和扩大。
    我们两国间的贸易关系，在中华人民共和国成立后就开始建立了，而且一年比一年发展。
    罗中两国科学与技术合作协定，便是两国友好互利合作的有力证明。
    罗马尼亚人民极其爱好中国人民的文化和艺术创作。中国文工团和展览会在我国人民的心目中所留下的深刻印象，中国文艺作品的罗马尼亚译本和电影翻译片所受到的欢迎，中国歌曲的流行——这些都显示了两国人民密切的友好关系。
    继续加强与扩大以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营各国间友好的经济和文化关系，是保卫和平的一个重要因素。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国在平等互利的基础上，也广泛地与其他各国扩充了经济关系。只在一九五○年至一九五三年这段期间，罗马尼亚人民共和国就与西欧各国扩大了百分之五十的贸易额。在一九五三年与四十四个资本主义国家进行了贸易。它在一九五四年签订了许多贸易协定，缔约国包括印度、印度尼西亚、埃及、丹麦、土耳其、冰岛、挪威、奥地利和希腊。
    同时罗马尼亚人民共和国坚持不渝地鼓励与各国展开文化交流，借以促进和平事业和国际合作。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国一贯采取的外交政策，是本着国际合作以及不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处的原则，反对世界分裂为敌对的壁垒，反对军备竞赛，拥护集体安全。
    因此罗马尼亚政府一再声明它的决心，愿意与欧洲各国合作，缔结苏联倡议的保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约，这对于保持和巩固世界和平具有特殊的意义。
    现在罗马尼亚人民正在庆祝十年来的自由生活中所取得的成就，他们对世界和平事业的胜利满怀信心，这又大大鼓舞了他们建设新生活的决心。
    同志们，在结束我的讲话前，请允许我对中华人民共和国中央人民政府在今天晚上举行这个庆祝会的厚意表示罗马尼亚政府和我本人的谢意。
    伟大的苏联——罗马尼亚的解放者万岁！
    罗中两国人民牢不可破的、兄弟般的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营万岁！
    全世界和平力量万岁！世界和平万岁！
