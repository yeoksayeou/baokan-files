The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies jointly convened the Soil and Fertilizer Technology Conference in Beijing from July 16th to July 30th. The conference discussed technical issues related to launching a large-scale manure and fertilizer accumulation campaign, improving the fertility of already cultivated land, and surveying reclaimable wasteland to expand cultivated land area. The Chinese Soil Science Society was also officially established at this conference.

Our country has entered a period of large-scale economic construction, and the demand for agricultural products is growing daily, requiring agricultural workers and scientific workers to strive to increase yields per unit area and expand cultivated land area. With the cooperation in rural areas, the improvement of agricultural tools, and the improvement of many other agricultural technologies, improving soil fertility and creating conditions for continuously increasing yields per unit area has become a nationwide task. To this end, the Soil and Fertilizer Technology Conference put forward many specific methods such as increasing fertilizer application, developing irrigation, maintaining water and soil, improving soil, and improving cultivation techniques. In particular, in terms of increasing fertilizer application, the conference discussed in detail methods of expanding fertilizer sources such as increasing the accumulation of human and animal manure, increasing the accumulation of compost, expanding green manure planting area, utilizing urban feces and ditch sludge, and promoting organic-mineral mixed fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers. These methods have provided a technical basis for improving and maintaining soil fertility.

Another way to increase the total amount of agricultural products is to expand the cultivated land area. According to the known reclaimable wasteland, it is mainly distributed in the black calcium soil area of ​​the Northeast, the saline soil area of ​​the Northwest and coastal areas, and the red soil area of ​​South China. After considering current manpower and investment conditions, the conference formulated a method for surveying 20 million hectares of reclaimable wasteland within three years.

More than 280 people, including soil scientists, agronomists, professors, and scientific research workers, attended the conference.

    土壤肥料技术会议在北京举行
    中国土壤学会在这个会议上宣告成立
    七月十六日到七月三十日，中央人民政府农业部、中国科学院和中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会在北京召开了土壤肥料技术会议，讨论了开展大规模积肥保肥运动、提高已耕地土壤肥力和调查可开垦的荒地以扩大耕地面积的技术问题。中国土壤学会也在这次会上宣告正式成立。
    我国已进入大规模经济建设时期，农产品的需要正日益增长，要求农业工作者和科学工作者从提高单位面积产量和扩大耕地面积两方面来努力。随着农村的合作化、农具的改良和其他很多农业技术的改进，提高土壤肥力、为不断提高单位面积产量创造条件，已经成为全国性的任务。为此，土壤肥料技术会议提出了增施肥料、发展灌溉、保持水土、改良土壤和改进耕作技术等许多具体办法；特别是在增施肥料方面，会议详尽地讨论了增积人畜粪尿、增积堆肥、扩大绿肥种植面积、利用城市粪便和沟渠污物、推行有机物矿物混合肥料和细菌肥料等开辟肥源的方法。这些方法已为提高和保持土壤肥力提供了技术基础。
    增加农产品总量的另一途径是扩大耕地面积。根据会议所已知的可垦荒地，主要分布在东北的黑钙土区和西北、沿海的盐土区以及华南的红壤区。会议在考虑了目前的人力和投资等条件以后，拟订了一个在三年内调查二千万公顷可垦荒地的办法。
    参加这次会议的有土壤学家、农学家、教授和科学研究工作人员等共二百八十多人。
