    The main task currently facing rural work comrades and all farmers is to quickly adopt active and effective measures to overcome rain, flood and waterlogging disasters, and strive to complete this year's agricultural production plan.
    This year, due to the dissemination of the state's general task for the transitional period among the broad masses of farmers, the implementation of planned purchase and supply of grain and other major agricultural products, and the implementation of various policies to support farmers in developing production, farmers' enthusiasm for production and mutual cooperation has been unprecedentedly high. Therefore, this year has seen great achievements in completing the sowing plans for grain, cotton and other crops, in improving agricultural technology to increase yields per unit area, and in overcoming natural disasters. This year, wheat has had a bumper harvest across the country, with total output estimated to increase by more than 6 billion catties compared to last year, exceeding the state's production plan. At present, autumn crops are growing well in most parts of the country, and early rice has already had a bumper harvest in many areas. These are all concrete manifestations of achievement.
    However, this year is also the year with the highest rainfall. Especially in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the Huai River, the rainfall is concentrated, the rainy season is too long, and the Yangtze and Huai River floods rise simultaneously, with water levels unprecedented in nearly a century. Many low-lying areas along the rivers, along the Huai River, and around the lakes have also suffered from rain and waterlogging disasters. In these areas, early rice has failed, middle rice has been flooded, late rice cannot be transplanted in time, and the floods are still continuing, and the disaster is still developing. This has brought serious threats to this year's agricultural production. Quickly taking active and effective measures to eliminate this threat, overcome this difficulty, strive to complete this year's agricultural production plan, and work hard to save grain has become the most serious and urgent task for all rural work comrades and the broad masses of farmers.
    In order to accomplish this task, what measures must be taken by the party and government leading organs at all levels, and what work must be done by rural work comrades in various places?
    First of all, party and government leading organs at all levels and rural work comrades, in addition to practicing strict economy and fighting against all waste, must strive to over fulfill agricultural production increase tasks in the vast non-disaster areas. This is a major way to strive to complete this year's agricultural production plan. This year, the non-disaster areas, which account for more than 94 percent of the country's total cultivated land, generally have good growth of autumn crops due to favorable weather. As long as all regions seize the opportunity, mobilize farmers to put in more effort, work harder, and strengthen weeding, fertilization, pest control, drainage, flood prevention, and drought prevention according to different situations and different crops, and, according to the specific conditions of each region, plant another season of late autumn crops as much as possible in winter fallow land after the early maturing crops are harvested, then it is entirely possible to over fulfill the agricultural production plan in these regions. It is also very promising to make up for the losses in the disaster areas. Recently, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang and other provinces have called on farmers in non-disaster areas to plant another season of late autumn crops. Hubei Province plans to increase grain production by 2.5 percent more than the original plan in non-disaster areas, and Hunan Province plans to increase grain production by 1.5 billion catties in mountainous and hilly areas. These are all very necessary and appropriate measures. Some cadres in non-disaster areas are satisfied with the current state of agricultural production and have relaxed their leadership over production work; or they think that it is too late and that it is too late to increase production. This wrong idea must be quickly corrected.
    Secondly, it is necessary to do a good job in drainage, protecting seedlings, and replanting in the disaster areas. In some disaster areas, some cultivated land has already failed, but most of the cultivated land can still maintain a certain amount of harvest due to timely rescue or rapid water drop. Therefore, in the disaster areas, in addition to continuing to make persistent efforts to ensure flood control projects, overcome floods and waterlogging, and no longer expand the disaster area, we must also do a good job in drainage and rescue, protecting seedlings and cultivating seedlings, and replanting late autumn crops, implement the principle of planting one more mu is one mu, and harvesting one more percent is one more percent, and never give up any small opportunity to make an effort. For the seeds needed for replanting late autumn crops, the disaster areas should first try their best to adjust and solve them locally; if they cannot be adjusted and solved, all provinces across the country should actively support each other. In terms of overall planning, allocation and transportation, the relevant departments of the central government must provide timely assistance to the disaster areas. Doing these tasks well can reduce losses and maintain a certain harvest in the disaster areas, can improve the production mood and confidence in production and self-rescue of the people in the disaster areas, and can easily lead the people in the disaster areas to quickly resume production. This is a very urgent and important task.
    Again, in the autumn harvest this year, whether in non-disaster areas or disaster areas, it is necessary to do a good job in harvesting and increase the harvest of various crops. In the past, in the harvesting process in various places, there were often a lot of losses due to untimely harvesting, poor harvesting methods, or incomplete harvesting tools, resulting in the phenomenon of abundant production but not abundant harvest. According to a survey of four townships in Yongning County, Guangxi Province last year, 12 to 13 catties of rice were lost per mu in the process of harvesting, transporting and threshing late rice; a field experiment conducted by Lianhu Farm in Jiangsu Province during the harvesting of late rice also yielded the same proof. According to a typical survey in Sichuan Province, the loss of medium-maturing rice in the harvesting process generally accounts for 3 to 5 percent of the actual harvest. If the average loss of rice across the country is calculated at 3 percent of the actual harvest, the total loss will be more than 4 billion catties. From this, it can be seen how important it is to reduce losses during the harvest process. This year, in the process of autumn harvest in various places, it is necessary, without exception, to universally organize the masses of farmers to improve harvesting methods, improve harvesting tools, carry out harvesting in a timely manner, reduce losses, and increase the harvest. At the same time, the broad masses should be educated that no grain should be wasted in any bumper harvest area. As long as attention is paid to doing these tasks well, the country can increase a considerable amount of grain.
    To do the above work well, it is impossible without the conscious action of the broad masses of farmers and without the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. Therefore, party and government leading organs at all levels must take prompt and effective measures to fully explain to the masses of farmers the necessity of overcoming natural disasters, striving to overfulfill the task of increasing production, and actively supporting farmers in disaster areas, continue to explain to them the state's agricultural tax policy, and propose realistic and feasible goals for increasing production, dispel their ideological concerns, and help them find ways to truly increase production. Rural work comrades in various places must go deep into the countryside, go deep into the masses, listen to their opinions, understand their difficulties, and help them solve specific problems. Attention should be paid to prevent coercive orders, and careful ideological mobilization work should be done; if coercive orders are adopted, it will only cause confusion in the work, increase the difficulty of the work, and ruin the work.
    The facts in various places prove that mutual aid and cooperation organizations have always played a leading role in disaster relief and production work. Therefore, closely combining the current production increase movement with the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and relying on mutual aid and cooperation organizations to drive all farmers is the key to mobilizing all farmers to complete the above tasks. Party and government leading organs at all levels must strengthen their leadership over mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams must do a good job in their own production increase work, rely on party members, league members and production activists within the cooperatives and teams to drive and unite all members of the cooperatives and teams to find ways for their cooperatives and teams to overcome disasters and overfulfill the task of increasing production, formulate production increase plans, rationally organize the use of labor, improve the method of evaluating work and recording points, improve the production enthusiasm and labor productivity of members of the cooperatives and teams, and give full play to the superiority of collective production and collective disaster overcoming of the groups and cooperatives. In some disaster areas, in leading farmers to fight against natural disasters, they do not rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations and relax their leadership over mutual aid and cooperation organizations, so that some agricultural production cooperatives have collapsed. This practice is obviously wrong.
    There are many difficulties in agricultural production this year, and we must face up to the current difficult situation and not have the slightest slack or懈怠. However, as long as the whole country is mobilized to overcome natural disasters and strive to increase production and conserve resources, we will definitely be able to overcome these difficulties.

### 力争完成今年农业生产计划

    力争完成今年农业生产计划
    当前摆在农村工作同志和全体农民面前的主要任务，就是要迅速采取积极有效的措施，战胜雨涝和洪水灾害，力争完成今年的农业生产计划。
    由于今年在广大农民群众中，宣传了国家过渡时期的总任务，实行了粮食等主要农产品的计划收购和计划供应，贯彻了扶助农民发展生产的各种政策，农民的生产积极性和互助合作的积极性都空前高涨。因而今年在完成粮食、棉花等农作物的播种计划方面，在改进农业技术提高单位面积产量方面，在克服自然灾害方面，都有很大的成绩。今年全国各地小麦普遍丰收，总产量估计可比去年增加在六十亿斤以上，超额完成了国家的生产计划。目前全国大部分地区的秋季作物生长良好，许多地区的早稻已经丰收。这些都是成绩的具体表现。
    但是，今年也是雨量最大的一年，特别是在长江中下游和淮河沿岸一带，雨量集中，雨期过长，江淮洪水同时并涨，水位之高为近百年来所未有；沿江、沿淮和滨湖的许多低洼地区，也遭到雨涝灾害。这些地区早稻失收，中稻被淹，晚稻不能适时插秧，而且目前洪水仍在持续，灾情仍未停止发展。这就给今年的农业生产带来了严重的威胁。迅速采取积极有效的措施，消除这种威胁，克服这个困难，力争完成今年的农业生产计划，并努力节约粮食，就成为当前所有农村工作同志和广大农民一个最严重和最迫切的任务。
    为了完成这个任务，各级党、政领导机关必须采取那些措施，各地农村工作同志必须作好那些工作呢？
    首先是各级党、政领导机关和农村工作同志，除了厉行节约，和一切浪费现象做斗争以外，必须在广大非灾区争取超额完成农业增产任务，这是力争完成今年农业生产计划的一个主要办法。今年占全国全部耕地的百分之九十四以上的非灾区，因风调雨顺，大秋作物一般地都生长很好。各个地区只要抓紧时机，动员农民多出一点力气，多加一把劲，分别不同情况，不同作物，加强锄草、施肥、除虫、排水、防涝、防旱等工作，并根据各个地区的具体情况，在早熟作物收割以后，尽可能利用冬闲地，多种一季晚秋作物，那末，在这些地区超额完成农业生产计划是完全可能的；以此来弥补灾区减产的损失，也是大有希望的。最近湖北、湖南、安徽、浙江等省，号召非灾区农民多种一季晚秋作物，湖北省计划在非灾区比原计划超额增产粮食百分之二点五，湖南省计划在山区、丘陵区超额增产粮食十五亿斤，这都是十分必要的适当的措施。有一部分非灾区的干部，满足于目前农业生产的状况，放松对生产工作的领导；或者认为时间已晚，增产已经来不及。这种错误的想法，必须迅速纠正。
    其次是必须在受灾地区作好排涝、保苗、补种等工作。在受灾地区有一部分耕地已经失收，但是大部分耕地，由于抢救及时，或落水较快，仍能保持一定数量的收成。因此，在受灾地区，除了必须再接再厉，确保防洪工程，战胜洪水和雨涝，不再扩大灾害面积以外，同时必须作好排涝抢救，保苗育苗，补种晚秋作物等工作，贯彻多种一亩是一亩，多收一成是一成的方针，绝不应放弃任何一个微小的努力机会。对补种晚秋作物所需的种子，受灾地区首先应尽量设法就地调剂，就地解决；不能调剂解决的，全国各省之间应积极互相支援。在统筹调拨和运输方面，中央有关各部门必须给受灾地区以及时的帮助。作好了这些工作，就可以使受灾地区减少损失和保持一定的收成，就可以提高受灾地区人民的生产情绪和生产自救的信心，就容易领导受灾地区的人民迅速恢复生产。这是一项十分紧迫而又重要的工作。
    再次是在今年的秋收过程中，无论是非灾区或受灾地区，都必须作好收割工作，提高各种农作物的收获量。过去各地在收获过程中，往往由于收割不及时，或收割方法不好，或收割用的工具不齐，抛撒损失很多，以致常常造成丰产不丰收的现象。根据去年广西省邕宁县四个乡的调查，晚稻在收割、挑运、脱粒过程中，每亩损失稻谷十二斤到十三斤；江苏省练湖农场在收割晚稻时进行实地试验，也得到了同样的证明。又根据四川省的典型调查，中熟稻在收获过程中的抛撒损失，一般占实际收获量的百分之三到五。如果全国水稻平均抛撒损失以实际收获量的百分之三计算，损失总额就会有四十亿斤以上。由此可见，在收获过程中，减少抛撒损失，有多么重要的意义。今年各地在秋收过程中，必须毫无例外地普遍地组织农民群众改进收割方法，改良收割用的工具，适时地进行收割，减少抛撒损失，提高收获量。同时要教育广大群众，在任何丰收地区也不应该浪费一颗粮食。只要注意作好了这些工作，全国就可以增加一笔数量相当可观的粮食。
    要作好上述工作，没有广大农民群众的自觉的行动，没有广大农民群众的积极性，是不可能想像的。因此，各级党政领导机关，必须采取迅速有效的办法，充分地向农民群众说明必须战胜自然灾害，争取超额完成增产任务，并积极支援灾区农民的道理，向他们继续讲解国家农业税收的政策，并提出切实可行的增产奋斗目标，解除他们的思想顾虑，帮助他们找出真正能够增产的办法。各地农村工作同志，必须深入农村，深入群众，听取他们的意见，了解他们的困难，帮助他们具体解决问题。应注意防止强迫命令的作法，细致地作好思想发动工作；如果采用强迫命令的办法，就只会引起工作的混乱，增加工作的困难，把工作搞坏。
    各地的事实证明，在救灾和生产工作中，互助合作组织始终起着带头的作用。因此，把目前的增产运动和互助合作运动紧密地结合起来，依靠互助合作组织带动全体农民，这是发动全体农民完成上述任务的关键。各级党、政领导机关，必须加强对互助合作组织的领导。农业生产合作社和互助组，必须把本身的增产工作搞好，依靠社内、组内的党员、团员和生产积极分子，带动和团结全体社员、组员找出本社、本组战胜灾害和超额完成增产任务的办法，订好增产计划，合理组织使用劳动力，改进评工记分办法，提高社员、组员的生产积极性和劳动生产率，发挥组、社集体生产、集体战胜灾害的优越性。有的受灾地区在领导农民和自然灾害作斗争中，不依靠互助合作组织，放松了对互助合作组织的领导，以致有些农业生产合作社垮了台。这种作法显然是错误的。
    今年农业生产中的困难很多，我们必须正视当前的困难情况，不要有丝毫的麻痹懈怠。但是，只要全国一致动员起来，战胜自然灾害，努力增产节约，我们就一定能够克服这些困难。
