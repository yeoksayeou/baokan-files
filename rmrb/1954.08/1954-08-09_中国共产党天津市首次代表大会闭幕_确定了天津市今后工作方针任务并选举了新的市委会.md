    The First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Tianjin was held from July 20th to 29th. Based on the Party's General Line for the Transition Period and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, the conference summarized and reviewed the work of Tianjin over the past two years since the First Congress of the CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee, defined the working principles and tasks for Tianjin in the future, and elected a new CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee.

    Four hundred and eighty official delegates and one hundred non-voting delegates attended the meeting.

    Prior to the congress, the previous CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee made a preliminary summary and review of Tianjin's work over the past two years based on the Party's General Line for the Transition Period and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party. Huang Huoqing, Secretary of the CPC Municipal Committee, delivered a report to the congress.

    After discussion, the congress approved the work report made by Huang Huoqing. The delegates unanimously agreed that the Tianjin Party organization had been united in recent years and, under the leadership of the Municipal Committee, had correctly implemented the Party's political and organizational lines, especially after the First Congress of the Party. They further clarified the idea of focusing on production, strengthened specific leadership over industrial production, and launched a large-scale campaign to increase production and practice thrift. As a result, Tianjin's industrial production has been improved a step further. In 1953, the city's state-owned industries completed 104.9 percent of the annual gross output value plan, and local industries completed 110.74 percent. On the basis of completing the state plan, an additional 10.982 trillion yuan was produced for the state, and 7.639 trillion yuan was saved. In the first half of 1954, the total output value increased by 33.55 percent compared with the same period last year, strongly supporting the national capital construction and industrial and agricultural production. In the past year or so, state-owned and local state-owned industries have produced 237 new products to support factories and mines in various places and meet the needs of the people. The mines have also trained a considerable number of technicians and technical personnel to support the newly built factories in other places. Significant progress has also been made in developing state-owned commerce and transforming private capitalist industry and commerce. The total turnover of commodities in the city in 1953 increased by 41.83 percent compared with 1952. Among them, state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative commerce accounted for more than 70 percent of the city's total commodity turnover.

    As of the first half of this year, there were 39 joint state-private factories. The processing, ordering, sales, and procurement of private factories by state-owned trade departments and cooperatives accounted for an average of more than 65 percent of the total output value of private industry in 1953. Many private retail businesses have also established business relationships with state-owned businesses and have been incorporated into the track of the national plan.

    There are more than 28,000 handicraft households, with about 60,000 people, in the city. Now more than 13,000 people have joined the handicraft production cooperative organizations. On the basis of production development, the city's culture, education, health, transportation and other industries have also developed accordingly.

    The congress, in a spirit of fully promoting democracy, enthusiastically launched criticism and self-criticism. In his work report, Huang Huoqing affirmed the achievements of the past two years and also pointed out many shortcomings in the work. The 28 delegations participating in the congress put forward many positive criticisms. The delegates also made self-criticisms in connection with the bourgeois individualism, complacency and other issues existing in their departments or individuals.

    After heated discussions, the congress adopted the resolution of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Tianjin. According to the spirit of the General Line and the characteristics of Tianjin, the resolution pointed out that the working principles of Tianjin are: to give full play to the role of existing industry, to ensure the completion and strive for over-fulfillment of production and capital construction tasks, to conduct the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, handicrafts, and agriculture in a planned and step-by-step manner, to vigorously support the 141 key construction projects of the state, to actively supply farmers with means of production and means of livelihood, to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and to gradually meet the growing needs of the people. Other work should be carried out accordingly around the above center.

    After listing the specific steps of various tasks, the resolution emphasized the sharpness, complexity, and profundity of class struggle in the transition period. It pointed out that the outstanding manifestation of bourgeois individualism in the Party in Tianjin at present is complacency, self-proclaimed merit, paralysis and slackness, and lack of progress. Some cadres even become independent from the Party and fail to implement or resolutely implement the Party's policies. As a result, there are still phenomena of insufficient unity and insufficient coordination in some units. The reason for this situation is that the previous CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee underestimated the seriousness of bourgeois ideological corruption in its leadership, did not conduct systematic ideological education for cadres, did not carry out criticism and self-criticism sufficiently, and failed to deal with some cadres in a timely manner after they made mistakes.

    The resolution finally called on all Party members in Tianjin to guard against arrogance and rashness, strengthen learning, enhance unity, enhance revolutionary vigilance, strengthen Party spirit training, and maintain close ties with the masses.

    Before the congress elected the new CPC Municipal Committee, the presidium of the congress put forward a list of candidates, and the delegations spent two days deliberating and discussing them. Serious criticisms were made of the shortcomings of some candidates, which greatly educated both the candidates and the delegates participating in the congress. Finally, the congress elected Huang Huoqing, Wu De and 23 others as members of the CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee and 10 others as alternate members by secret ballot.

    中国共产党天津市首次代表大会闭幕
    确定了天津市今后工作方针任务并选举了新的市委会
    中国共产党天津市第一次代表大会在七月二十日到二十九日举行。会议根据党在过渡时期的总路线和党的七届四中全会的精神，总结和检查了中共天津市第一次代表会议以后二年来的工作，确定了天津市今后工作的方针和任务，并选举了新的中共天津市委员会。
    参加这次会的有正式代表四百八十人，列席代表一百人。
    这次大会召开以前，前届中共天津市委员会根据党在过渡时期的总路线和党的四中全会精神，对天津市二年来的工作作了初步总结和检查，由中共市委员会书记黄火青向这次大会作了报告。
    大会经过讨论，批准了黄火青所作的工作报告。代表们一致认为几年来天津市党的组织是团结的，在市委领导下，正确地贯彻了党的政治路线和组织路线，特别在党的第一次代表会议以后，进一步明确了以生产为中心的思想，加强了对工业生产的具体领导，大规模地开展了增产节约运动，因而使天津市的工业生产提高了一步。一九五三年全市国营工业完成全年总产值计划的百分之一○四点九，地方工业完成一一○点七四。在完成国家计划基础上，又为国家增产一万零九百八十二亿元，节约七千六百三十九亿元。一九五四年上半年的生产总值，比去年同期又增长了百分之三十三点五五，有力地支援了国家基本建设和工农业生产。一年多来国营和地方国营工业为支援各地厂矿及满足人民需要而生产的新产品就有二百三十七种。各矿还培养了相当数量的技术工人和技术人员支援了外地新建的工厂。在发展国营商业和对私人资本主义工商业进行改造方面，也有很大成绩。全市一九五三年的商品流转总额，比一九五二年增加百分之四十一点八三。其中国营、公私合营、合作社营的商业，已占全市商品流转总额的百分之七十以上。
    公私合营的工厂，截至今年上半年已有三十九户。国营贸易部门、合作社对私营工厂的加工、订货、包销、收购，一九五三年全年平均已占私营工业总产值的百分之六十五以上。私营零售商业，也有很多和国营商业建立了业务关系，纳入了国家计划的轨道。
    全市手工业有二万八千多户、约六万人，现在已有一万三千多人参加了手工业生产合作组织。在生产发展的基础上，全市文化、教育、卫生和交通运输业等方面也有相应的发展。
    大会在充分发扬民主的精神下，热烈地展开批评和自我批评。黄火青在工作报告中肯定了二年来的工作成绩，也指出了工作中的许多缺点。参加大会的二十八个代表团提出许多积极的批评意见。代表们也联系本部门工作或个人存在的资产阶级个人主义思想、骄傲自满情绪等，作了自我批评。
    经过热烈地讨论，大会通过了中共天津市第一次代表大会的决议。决议根据总路线精神和天津市的特点，指出天津市的工作方针是：充分发挥现有工业的作用，保证完成并争取超额完成生产和基本建设的任务，有计划有步骤地进行对资本主义工商业和手工业、农业的社会主义改造，大力支援国家一百四十一项重点建设工程，积极供给农民生产资料和生活资料，进一步巩固工农联盟，并逐步满足人民日益增长的需要。围绕以上中心，相应地进行其他工作。
    决议列举了各项工作的具体步骤后，强调指出在过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐、复杂和深刻性。指出目前天津市党内资产阶级个人主义思想的突出表现就是骄傲自满，功臣自居，麻痹松懈，不求进步。甚至有些干部向党闹独立性，不执行或不坚决执行党的政策。因而在某些单位还存在不够团结不够协调的现象。这种情况存在的原因，是前届中共天津市委员会在领导方面对资产阶级思想腐蚀的严重性估计不足，对干部有系统的思想教育作的不够，批评和自我批评开展的不够，在某些干部犯错误后未能及时处理。
    决议最后号召天津市全体党员，戒骄戒躁，加强学习，增强团结，提高革命警惕性，加强党性锻炼，密切联系群众。
    大会在选举新的中共市委员会以前，由大会主席团提出候选人名单，各代表团以两天的时间进行酝酿和讨论，对某些候选人的缺点，进行了严肃的批评，使候选人和参加大会的代表都受到很大的教育。大会最后以无记名投票方式选出黄火青、吴德等二十五人为中共天津市委员会委员，另选出十人为候补委员。
