    The first large-scale student track and field, and gymnastics meet of middle schools and above in thirteen cities in 1954 grandly opened at the People's Stadium in Lüda City on the 10th. This is the first large-scale student sports meet since the founding of New China.
    The weather was overcast and sunny on this day. Enthusiastic people of Lüda City braved the rain to rush to the venue. Red flags fluttered around the venue. A large portrait of Chairman Mao was hung high on the rostrum. A huge slogan facing the rostrum read Chairman Mao's instruction: "Good health, good study, good work." In front of the slogan on the stands, students from Lüda City were arranged in the shape of the words "Long Live Peace" and a dove of peace. The stands were filled with more than 30,000 spectators, including visiting delegations from various places.
    Among those attending the opening ceremony were Ma Yuehan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation, Che Xiangchen, former Director of the Sports Commission of the Northeast Administrative Committee, Zeng Zhaolun, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, Guo Shushen, Secretary of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee, and Qiao Chuanjue, Deputy Mayor of Lüda City. Representatives from the Soviet Consulate General in Dalian and Soviet experts assisting China in economic construction were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.
    The opening ceremony began at 8:30 AM. Athletes held the march-in ceremony amid the majestic military music. The referees' procession, led by chief referee Ma Yuehan, walked at the front, followed by the Beijing delegation, then the Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanjing delegations. The audience welcomed the Guangzhou delegation and the Wuhan delegation with warm applause; the former trekked mountains and rivers and overcame various difficulties to participate in the conference, and the latter included flood control and rescue personnel who had protected the safety of Wuhan City with their heroic actions. The audience also warmly welcomed the Xi'an delegation from the northwest of the motherland, and the Chongqing and Chengdu delegations from the southwest of the motherland, followed by the Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun delegations. The Lüda delegation, as the host of this city, walked at the end.
    A total of 638 athletes participated in this sports meet. Their average age is 17, and the youngest is only 13 years old. More than 80% of them are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, and some are Young Pioneers. The athletes include young students from the Han, Mongolian, Korean, Tibetan, Miao, and Buyi ethnic groups. These athletes have quite good academic performance in school, and most of them have a score of four or five.
    Che Xiangchen, Chairman of the Presidium of the conference, delivered the opening speech amid warm applause. He said that with the tremendous development of China's economic construction, the country needs a large number of construction talents. Today's students are a magnificent reserve force for building the motherland. All athletes and students in middle schools and above, in addition to studying politics and business diligently, must also actively participate in physical exercises and gradually improve their health so as to better devote themselves to the construction of the motherland. Zeng Zhaolun, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, gave examples in his speech to illustrate that the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao often care about the physical health of young students. He explained to the athletes that young students should not regard physical exercise and strengthening their physique as a personal matter, but should regard it as a lofty political task to prepare to participate in the construction and defense of the motherland. All athletes at this conference should learn from each other, exchange experiences, and, together with students from middle schools and above across the country, conscientiously respond to Chairman Mao's call to young people: "Good health, good study, good work."
    After the opening ceremony, various competitions began.
    On this day, a total of twenty events including track and field, gymnastics, and bicycle performances were held, of which four events, namely women's javelin, men's high jump, men's shot put, and men's 800 meters, have been finalized. As a result of the finals, Li Qi from Beijing won first place in the men's 800 meters with a score of 2 minutes and 0.3 seconds, which tied the highest record at the National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Bicycle Sports Meet in 1953. Tao Yanding from Tianjin won first place in the men's shot put with a score of 11 meters and 76 centimeters; Li Baipeng from Shenyang won first place in the men's high jump with a score of 1 meter and 76 centimeters; and Tang Rongqing from Chengdu won first place in the women's javelin with a score of 29 meters and 75.8 centimeters.
    The competition was very intense and exciting. In the men's 800-meter final, Li Qi from Beijing always maintained a relaxed and steady pace and ran in the first place. The artistic gymnastics performed by female students from seven middle schools in Lüda City deeply attracted the audience. The second group in the women's 80-meter hurdles preliminary round seemed particularly tense. When the starting gun fired, Li Zhichu from Beijing took the lead and crossed the first hurdle; midway, Zhang Ji from Lüda City caught up with Li Zhichu; but in the last second, Li Zhichu crossed the last hurdle with her skilled movements and reached the finish line first.
    The audience's emotions were consistently high. On the stands opposite the rostrum, spectators dressed in white and blue clothes arranged the five characters "Long Live Chairman Mao" in large characters with the colors of their clothes interspersed.

    第一次规模巨大的学生运动会在旅大开幕
    一九五四年十三个城市中等以上学校学生田径、体操运动大会十日在旅大市人民体育场隆重开幕。这是新中国成立后第一次规模巨大的学生运动大会。
    这一天天气时阴时晴。热心的旅大市人民冒雨赶到会场。会场四周飘扬着红旗。主席台上高悬着毛主席大幅画像。主席台对面的巨幅标语上写着毛主席的指示“身体好、学习好、工作好”。在标语前边的看台上，旅大市的学生们排列成“和平万岁”的字样和和平鸽子的图样。看台上坐满了三万多观众，其中有来自各地的参观团。
    出席大会开幕式的，有中华全国体育总会副主席马约翰、前东北行政委员会体育运动委员会主任车向忱、中央人民政府高等教育部副部长曾昭抡、中共旅大市委员会书记郭述申、旅大市人民政府副市长乔传珏等。苏联驻大连总领事馆代表和帮助我国从事经济建设的苏联专家也应邀参加了开幕式。
    开幕式在八时三十分举行。在雄壮的军乐声中运动员举行了入场式。以总裁判马约翰为首的裁判员行列走在最前边，后边是北京市代表队，接着是天津市、上海市和南京市的代表队。观众以热烈的掌声欢迎了广州市代表队和武汉市代表队；前者跋山涉水克服各种困难赶来参加大会，后者当中就有防汛抢险人员，曾以他们的英雄行为保卫武汉市的安全。观众也热烈欢迎了来自祖国西北的西安市代表队，来自祖国西南的重庆市和成都市代表队，接着是沈阳市、哈尔滨市和长春市的代表队。作为这个城市主人的旅大市代表队走在最后边。
    参加这次运动大会的运动员共六百三十八名。他们的平均年龄是十七岁，最小的仅十三岁。他们当中百分之八十以上是共产党员和青年团员，有的还是少年先锋队队员。运动员中包括汉、蒙古、朝鲜、藏、苗、布依等民族的青年学生。这些运动员在校的学习成绩都相当好，大多数人学习成绩是四分和五分。
    大会主席团主席车向忱在热烈的掌声中致开幕词。他说，随着我国经济建设的巨大发展，国家需要大批建设人材。今天的学生正是建设祖国的一支雄伟的后备大军，全体运动员和中等以上学校学生，除了努力学习政治和业务外，还必须积极参加体育锻炼，逐步改善健康状况，以便更好的投身祖国建设事业。中央人民政府高等教育部副部长曾昭抡在讲话中举例说明中央人民政府和毛主席经常的关心青年学生们的身体健康。他向运动员说明，青年学生不能把锻炼身体、增强体质看作个人的私事，而应作为准备参加祖国建设和保卫祖国的崇高的政治任务。全体运动员在这次大会上应该相互观摩、交流经验，并和全国中等以上学校的学生一起认真响应毛主席向青年提出的“身体好、学习好、工作好”的号召。
    开幕式结束，接着就开始了各项比赛。

    竞赛进行得十分紧张精采。在男子八百公尺决赛时，北京市李琦始终保持着轻松平稳的步伐跑在第一。旅大市七个中学的女学生表演的艺术体操深深地吸引了观众。女子八十公尺低栏预赛时第二组显得特别紧张，当信号枪一响，北京市李治初一人当先越过了第一个栏；在中途，旅大市张辑追上李治初；但在最末的一秒钟，李治初以她熟练的动作 跨过了最后一个栏，优先到达终点。
    观众的情绪始终很高。在主席台对面的看台上，穿着白、蓝两色衣服的观众们，用他们衣服的颜色相间地排成“毛主席万岁”五个大字。
