Shandong Province Establishes Seventy Afforestation Extension Stations in Key Mountainous Areas

Shandong Province is actively carrying out afforestation work in mountainous areas, establishing seventy afforestation extension stations in key mountainous regions. The central and southern parts of the province and the Jiaodong area have many mountains, accounting for about 21% of the province's total area. In the past, due to the scarcity of trees, not only was timber lacking, but frequent floods and droughts occurred, causing great difficulties for the development of agricultural production. In recent years, the province has afforested more than 2 million mu and closed off more than 7 million mu for forest cultivation, initially changing the natural landscape of the mountainous areas. This has reduced soil erosion, conserved water sources, and ensured agricultural production. In order to vigorously promote afforestation in mountainous areas to meet the needs of national construction, the Shandong Provincial People's Government has decided to establish seventy afforestation extension stations in major mountainous areas such as Lu Mountain and Yi Mountain to mobilize the masses to plant trees in a planned way and promote advanced afforestation experience and scientific technologies. At present, in addition to the fifty-one locations in the Linyi and Tai'an regions that are being prepared for establishment, the nineteen locations in the four regions of Changwei, Jining, and Jiaozhou have been completed and have begun conducting land surveys suitable for afforestation and formulating plans.

    山东省重点山区建立七十个造林推广站
    山东省积极开展山区造林工作，在重点山区建立七十个造林推广站。该省中南部和胶东一带山岭很多，约占全省总面积的百分之二十一。过去由于树木很少，不仅用材缺乏，而且酿成频繁的水旱灾害，给发展农业生产造成了很大困难。近几年来全省共造林二百多万亩、封山育林七百多万亩，初步改变了山区的自然面貌，许多荒山已经长起了葱绿的杂草和茂密的幼树。从而减轻了水土冲刷、涵蓄了水源，保障了农业生产。山东省人民政府为了大力开展山区造林工作，以适应国家建设的需要，决定在鲁山、沂山等主要山区建立七十个造林推广站，有计划地发动群众造林和推广造林先进经验及科学技术。目前除临沂、泰安两专区的五十一处正在筹备建立外，其他昌潍、济宁、胶州等四个专区的十九处已经建成，并着手进行宜林地勘查和编制计划。　（李宪臻）
