More Than 500 Agricultural Cooperatives in Minhou Special District Universally Increased Early Rice Production

The more than 500 agricultural production cooperatives in the Minhou Special District of Fujian Province have universally increased their early rice production. After the summer harvest, the enthusiasm of the cooperative members is high, and they continue to work hard to strive for a good autumn harvest.

The early rice harvest in the Minhou area ended at the end of July. The 528 agricultural production cooperatives in the eight counties of the district had a summer harvest area of ​​more than 39,000 mu. Except for a small number of cooperatives in Fuqing County that reduced production due to disasters, most of the remaining 7 counties, accounting for more than 95% of the district, increased production by 10% to 30%. Judging from the production increase in various places, cooperatives are generally better than groups, and groups are stronger than individual farming. According to a survey of the output of 759.23 mu of early rice in eight cooperatives, 31 groups, and 30 individual farmers in Minqing County, the average yield per mu of agricultural cooperatives was 343 jin, an increase of 23.1% over last year. The average yield per mu of mutual aid teams was 311 jin, an increase of 8.66% over last year. Cooperatives can harvest 32 jin more per mu than groups, and 81 jin more than individual households.

Because agricultural cooperatives have demonstrated their superiority in production, the number of mutual aid teams requesting to establish cooperatives has generally increased after the summer harvest. For example, in Luoyuan County, there were originally 260 groups requesting to establish cooperatives, and currently there are 320 mutual aid teams actively requesting to establish cooperatives. According to the heads of 18 old cooperatives in Minhou Dongta and other places, there are currently 151 mutual aid teams and many individual farmers, a total of 1,253 households, requesting to establish cooperatives in the 18 townships where they are located. Among them, 232 households requested to join their cooperatives.

    闽侯专区五百多农业合作社早稻普遍增产
    福建省闽侯专区五百多个农业生产合作社，早稻普遍增产，夏收后社员情绪高涨，继续努力争取秋季丰收。
    闽侯地区早稻收割于七月底已告结束。全区八个县五百二十八个农业生产合作社，夏收面积三万九千多亩，除福清县因受灾少数社减产外，其余七个县占全区百分之九十五以上的社大部分增产一成到三成。从各地增产情况来看，一般是社比组好，组比单干强。据闽清县对八个社、三十一个组、三十户单干农民，一共七百五十九亩二分三厘早稻产量的调查，农业社每亩平均产量三百四十三斤比去年增产百分之二十三点一，互助组每亩平均三百一十一斤比去年增产百分之八点六六，社比组每亩可多收三十二斤，比单干户多收八十一斤。
    由于农业社在生产中显示了优越性，夏收后要求办社的互助组普遍增加，如罗源县原有二百六十个组要求办社，目前即有三百二十个互助组积极要求办社。据闽侯东塔等十八个老社社长反映：他们所在的十八个乡，目前就有一百五十一个互助组和许多单干农民共一千二百五十三户要求办社，其中有二百三十二户要求参加到他们的社里来。
