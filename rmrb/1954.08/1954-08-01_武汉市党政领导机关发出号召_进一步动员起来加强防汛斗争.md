All personnel of the drainage fleet should improve drainage efficiency, remove accumulated rain inside the dikes, and facilitate the transportation of flood control personnel and materials and the consolidation of dikes. 3. The city's flood control reserve team should be prepared and await dispatch. 4. Service teams organized by various people's organizations should strengthen service activities and act together with the reserve team when necessary. 5.

The people of the city should organize to actively support flood control. 7. In order to consolidate the morale of the flood control front line, ensure the safety of the people of the city in any situation, and avoid all avoidable losses, the rear should immediately complete some necessary measures to be prepared for any eventuality. The order concluded: Our flood control army is strong and powerful, and its experience is becoming richer day by day; the dikes have been raised and thickened, and have stood firm despite more than a month of high water levels and storms; flood control equipment and materials are sufficient with the support of the whole country.
