Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd - According to the Central People's Government's "Decision on Abolishing First-Level Administrative Organs in Greater Administrative Areas and Merging Several Provinces and Municipalities," Liaoning Province officially announced its establishment on August 1st. At the inaugural meeting held on the 1st, Huang Oudong, Secretary of the CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee, explained the important significance of abolishing first-level administrative organs in greater administrative areas and establishing Liaoning Province. Then, based on the characteristics of Liaoning Province, such as its large proportion of heavy industry, many important basic construction projects, and its position as a frontier of national defense, he pointed out that the tasks of socialist construction and socialist transformation in Liaoning Province are very arduous and challenging. He called on cadres throughout the province to unite and cooperate, and work diligently to complete this arduous task in accordance with the spirit of the Resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CCP. In the construction of the new province, according to the principle of "hand over well, take over well, clean up well, arrange well" determined at the Fourth Enlarged Meeting of the Northeast Administrative Committee, the new province should be built up steadily and rapidly, so as not to affect the work of the province due to the merger of provinces. Huang Oudong also emphasized the great significance of the official establishment of Liaoning Province on the occasion of commemorating the 27th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day. He said, "Cadres throughout the province must learn from the spirit of hard struggle, overcoming difficulties, and striving for victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to meet new tasks."

Du Zheheng, Ning Wu, Che Xiangchen, Wang Zheng, Zhou Yong, Li Huang, Qiu Xiantong, and other responsible persons from the Party, government, and military in Liaoning Province, all spoke at the meeting, unanimously supporting the Central People's Government's decision on abolishing first-level administrative organs in greater administrative areas and merging several provinces and municipalities, and celebrating the establishment of Liaoning Province. In his speech, Du Zheheng pointed out that to do a good job in the province merger work, all cadres must unite and cooperate, help each other, learn from each other's strengths, overcome shortcomings, be self-denying and generous, oppose sectarianism and complacency, give full play to democracy, strengthen collective leadership, give full play to collective wisdom, and complete new and arduous work tasks under the leadership of the CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee.

Note: Liaoning Province takes Shenyang as its center and basically merges the original Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces (except for some areas assigned to Jilin Province). It has jurisdiction over ten cities, including Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Dalian, Benxi, Yingkou, Andong, Liaoyang, Jinzhou, and Fuxin, and thirty-four counties, with a population of approximately eighteen million.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 3rd - According to the Central People's Government's "Decision on Abolishing First-Level Administrative Organs in Greater Administrative Areas and Merging Several Provinces and Municipalities" and the Northeast Administrative Committee's implementation plan for implementing this decision, the original Songjiang Province and Heilongjiang Province officially merged on August 1st, and the new Heilongjiang Province was declared established. The administrative division of Songjiang Province was abolished at the same time, and Harbin City was also incorporated into the administrative division of Heilongjiang Province. The CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee and the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government officially began work in Harbin City on the 1st.

On the evening of the 1st, the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee and the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government held a cadre meeting to celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day and the establishment of the new Heilongjiang Province. More than 1,200 people attended the meeting, including Ouyang Qin and Han Guang, responsible persons from the Party, government, and military aspects of Heilongjiang Province, and from various democratic parties and people's organizations. At the meeting, Ouyang Qin, Secretary of the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, pointed out that under the general task of the country's transition period, the basic task of the province is to fully develop industrial, agricultural, and forestry production, do a good job in all work serving production, and promote the steady growth of socialist economic components, so as to gradually improve the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of developing production. Subsequently, Han Guang, Qiang Xiaochu, Feng Jixin, and Ren Zhongyi spoke successively. They all expressed their support for the central government's decision to abolish first-level administrative organs in greater administrative areas and merge several provinces and municipalities, and warmly congratulated the establishment of Heilongjiang Province; and called on cadres throughout the province to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, strengthen unity, closely connect with the masses, and better shoulder the new glorious and arduous work tasks.

Note: Heilongjiang Province is an important industrial and agricultural area in our country that was liberated earlier, with a vast territory, fertile land, rich resources, and convenient transportation. The province's industrial, agricultural, and forestry production all account for a considerable proportion. The province includes five cities: Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, and Hegang, and sixty-eight counties, with a population of approximately eleven million eight hundred thousand.
