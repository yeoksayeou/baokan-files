Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Reception

Dear Deputy Prime Minister, dear comrades and friends:

I, on behalf of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China, once again extend a warm welcome to Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong for his visit to our country at the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China. At the same time, I am deeply honored by the Deputy Prime Minister's friendly visit to China, and express my sincere gratitude.

The Chinese Government and people heartily congratulate the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the achievements made at the Geneva Conference. The agreements reached at the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina are a major contribution to consolidating world peace and security, especially peace and security in Asia. It proves that peace has once again triumphed over war. It promotes a further easing of international tensions and opens the way for the negotiated settlement of other major international issues. Now, more and more people in the world agree with the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, and the so-called policy of strength that insists on expanding armaments and preparing for war has become increasingly unpopular. However, the bellicose group in the United States is not reconciled to the defeat it suffered at the Geneva Conference. It is carrying out provocations in various ways in the West, especially in the East. To this end, all parties concerned must be vigilant and continue to overcome all possible difficulties and obstacles in order to further defend peace in Asia and the world.

The people of China and Vietnam have close relations and deep friendship. The Chinese people have always expressed brotherly concern for the just cause of the Vietnamese people. In the past few years, economic and cultural relations between the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have been further developed. I am convinced that in the days of peace to come, the unity and friendship between our two countries will be further developed and consolidated. I am convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people will achieve new and greater victories in the struggles ahead, and I ask you—dear Deputy Prime Minister—to convey the brotherly respect of the Chinese people to the Vietnamese people when you return to your country.

Long live President Ho Chi Minh!

Long live the friendly unity of the Chinese and Vietnamese people!

Long live the forces of peace and democracy headed by the great Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    周恩来总理在招待会上的讲话亲爱的副总理同志，亲爱的同志和朋友们：
    范文同副总理应中华人民共和国政府的邀请来我国访问，我谨代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向副总理同志再一次表示热烈的欢迎；同时，对副总理同志到中国的友好访问，深感荣幸，并致以深厚的谢意。
    中国政府和人民衷心地祝贺越南民主共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上所取得的成就。日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题所获致的协议，对巩固世界和平与安全，特别是对亚洲的和平与安全是一重大贡献。它证明和平又一次战胜了战争。它促使国际紧张局势进一步的缓和，并为协商解决其他重大国际问题开辟了道路。现在，世界上赞成不同社会制度的国家和平共处的人已经愈来愈多，坚持扩军备战的所谓实力政策的人已经日益不得人心。但是，美国的好战集团还不甘心它在日内瓦会议上所遭受的失败。它正在西方，尤其是在东方，进行多方挑衅。为此，各有关方面必须提高警惕，继续克服各种可能发生的困难和阻碍，以进一步保卫亚洲及世界和平。
    中越两国人民具有密切的关系和深厚的友谊。中国人民对于越南人民的正义事业历来表示兄弟般的关怀。过去几年来，中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国之间的经济和文化关系已有了进一步的发展。我深信，今后在和平的日子里，我们两国之间的团结和友谊会得到更进一步的发展和巩固。我深信，英勇的越南人民在今后的斗争中将获得新的更大的胜利，并请您——亲爱的副总理同志，在回到贵国时，为中国人民向越南人民表示兄弟般的敬意。
    胡志明主席万岁！
    中越人民的友好团结万岁！
    以伟大的苏联为首的和平民主力量万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
