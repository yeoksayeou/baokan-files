The residents of Wuhan's suburbs and those living outside the levees whose homes were flooded have been relocated to safe areas thanks to the kind concern of the People's Government and the effective measures taken. Many public buildings in Wuhan, such as schools and clubs, have been made available for the relocated residents. Many military units, government agencies, and organizations have proactively vacated their grand halls, conference rooms, recreation rooms, and dormitories to warmly receive them. Many citizens have also vacated their houses to accommodate their relatives and friends. Some citizens have even vacated their houses for relocated residents they do not know, saying, "Under the leadership of the People's Government, we are one family."

In late June, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, while engaged in intense flood prevention efforts, also assigned a large number of cadres and organized a vast transportation force to help residents whose homes were flooded to relocate. In areas that were not yet flooded but were threatened by the floodwaters, the district governments and police stations also promptly mobilized and assisted residents in evacuating. To ensure that these residents could move to safe places as soon as possible, the cadres, Communist Party members, and Communist Youth League members worked tirelessly day and night, regardless of the sun and rain. They investigated the population and difficulties of the residents who needed to be relocated, surveyed empty houses, organized transportation, and even helped carry belongings and hold children. They did their best to solve the practical difficulties in the lives of the relocated residents. The various government agencies, organizations, and citizens who vacated their houses also did their best to help the relocated residents overcome difficulties. On June 25th, heavy rain caused waterlogging in the Hubin Glorious Village and Jixing Street in the suburbs of Wuhan. The next morning, more than 60 soldiers and people's police braved the rain to help the more than 400 households there move. They carried the elderly and held the children, and even took off their own raincoats to cover the luggage, relocating more than 1,300 people in less than four hours. In early July, when the Yangtze River flood threatened Yingwuzhou in Hanyang, more than 200 cadres led a large number of boats and, in three days and three nights, moved all the residents of Yingwuzhou to safety.

Now, the lives of the relocated residents are very stable, and those with financial difficulties have received relief from the People's Government. As of July 25th, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government had issued more than 2.7 billion yuan in relief funds and is helping those with financial difficulties to engage in production for self-reliance. An elderly woman in her sixties, Tian, was deeply moved and said, "My husband suffered from mental illness due to oppression in the old society, and the family relied on me to raise pigs for a living. During the great flood of 1931, my pigs were all snatched away by others, and I searched east and west to find only two of them. When the flood came, I grabbed my daughter's braid and almost got washed away, barely surviving. Who would care about you then? Now, the People's Government sent people to help us move, gave us such good houses to live in, and even cured my nephew's illness. We must work hard in production to improve our own families."

    武汉市人民政府采取有效措施
    妥善安置市郊和堤外住宅被淹的居民
    武汉市郊区和堤外住宅被淹的居民，由于人民政府的亲切关怀和采取了有效的措施，都已迁入安全地区。武汉市内许多公用的房屋如学校、俱乐部都给迁移居民住用。很多部队、机关、团体都主动腾出大礼堂、会议室、文娱室和宿舍，热情地接待他们。许多市民也腾出房屋来接待自己的亲友。有的市民腾出房屋来给从不相识的迁移居民住，他们说：在人民政府领导下我们是一家人啊。
    六月下旬，中共武汉市委员会和武汉市人民政府在紧张防汛的同时，还抽出大量干部，组织庞大的运输力量，来帮助住宅被淹的居民迁移。一些虽未被淹但已受洪水威胁的地区，区政府和公安局派出所也及时动员和帮助居民撤退。为使这些居民及早迁到安全的地方，干部们和共产党员、青年团员们，不顾日晒雨淋、不分昼夜地奔忙着。他们调查需要迁移的居民人口和困难，调查空房，组织搬运力量，一直到帮助搬东西、抱孩子。他们对迁移的居民生活上一些困难问题，都尽可能地设法加以解决。腾出房子来的各机关、团体和市民，也尽可能地帮助迁移居民克服困难。六月二十五日大雨，武汉市郊湖滨光荣村和吉星街积水。第二天清早，六十多个部队战士和人民警察冒雨去帮助那里的四百多户居民搬家。他们背老人、抱小孩，而且脱下自己的雨衣来盖行李，不到四个小时就把一千三百多人迁出来了。七月上旬长江洪水威胁着汉阳鹦鹉洲，两百多名干部率领大批船只，在三天三夜内使鹦鹉洲的居民全部搬到了安全的地方。
    现在，迁移居民的生活都很安定，生活困难的得到了人民政府救济。到七月二十五日为止，武汉市人民政府发出的救济款已达二十七亿元以上，并且正在帮助生活困难的生产自救。一位六十多岁的田老太太深受感动地说：“我丈夫在旧社会中受压迫得了精神病，家中靠我养猪过日子。一九三一年大水，我的猪都给别人抢跑了，找东赶西才找回来两只。洪水冲来，我一把抓住我女儿的大辫子，差点没叫冲走，好容易才活下命来，有谁来管你。现在人民政府早就派人来帮我们搬了家，给我们住这么好的房子，还给我的外甥医好了病。我们得努力生产来搞好自己的家务。”　　（新华社）
