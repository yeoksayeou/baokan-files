We solemnly declare to the world: Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan.

Sixty years ago, Japanese imperialism forcibly occupied Taiwan. The Chinese people carried out a long struggle and finally, in the victory of the great Anti-Japanese War, made it possible for our Taiwan compatriots to return to the embrace of the motherland on October 25, 1945. The Chinese people will never tolerate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique seizing Taiwan, and will never tolerate the American aggressor clique occupying Taiwan.

Under the protection of the US government, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique fled to Taiwan, turning Taiwan into a nest of traitors. For several years, this traitorous clique has sold Taiwan's rich products and resources to the US government in exchange for US military aid. In Taiwan, they suppress patriotic movements, massacre patriotic compatriots, plunder people's wealth, and force young people to become cannon fodder, plunging our Taiwan compatriots into a deep abyss of suffering. This traitorous clique deceives and persecutes overseas Chinese, plunders their property, and lures young overseas Chinese to join bandit troops. Relying on the protection of the US Navy and Air Force, this traitorous clique attacks coastal islands of the motherland, bombs coastal cities of the motherland, loots merchant ships of the motherland and ships trading with the motherland, sends special agents to carry out assassinations, and robs and kills fishermen, constantly carrying out harassing and destructive warfare against the motherland. Recently, this traitorous clique has even conspired with the US government to sign a so-called "bilateral mutual security treaty" to establish a military alliance, attempting to coordinate with US armed forces to attack the mainland of the motherland, provoke a world war, and subject mankind to unprecedented catastrophe. This traitorous clique is not only the public enemy of the Chinese people but also the public enemy of the people of Asia and the world.

As the world knows, the American aggressor clique has always been hostile to the People's Republic of China. In June 1950, the US government launched the Korean War of aggression, intensified its intervention in the Indochina War, and at the same time sent the US Seventh Fleet to invade the Taiwan Strait and occupy our territory of Taiwan. In doing so, the US government has violated the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," which it itself participated in signing, recognizing that Taiwan is Chinese territory. Now, the Korean War has ceased, peace in Indochina has been restored, and international tensions are gradually easing. However, the American aggressor clique is unwilling to accept its defeat and is further supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to expand its armed interference and war threat against our country. The American aggressor clique is plotting to sign a so-called "bilateral mutual security treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, is piecing together Japanese reactionary forces, the Syngman Rhee clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to organize a so-called "Northeast Asia Defense League," and is actively wooing Britain and France and instigating certain countries in the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia to organize a so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group." This series of conspiratorial activities by the American aggressor clique is undoubtedly aimed primarily at the People's Republic of China as its main enemy.

The Chinese people love peace. The People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a peaceful policy. Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said in his foreign policy report on August 11, 1954: "China has no intention of侵略別国领土。China has no intention of invading the territory of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries invading China's territory. China has no intention of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries infringing upon China's sovereignty. China has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries interfering in China's internal affairs. China will never threaten the security of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries threatening the security of China." This is the common will of our 600 million Chinese people.

In order to safeguard national security and territorial integrity, and in order to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory and must not be allowed to be occupied by the United States, nor must it be allowed to be placed under United Nations trusteeship. Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is an exercise of China's sovereignty and is China's internal affair, which no foreign country is allowed to interfere with. If foreign aggressors dare to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, that is interfering in China's internal affairs, infringing upon China's sovereignty, and undermining China's territorial integrity. They must bear all the serious consequences of this act of aggression.

Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the sacred historical task of the Chinese people. Only by liberating Taiwan from the tyranny of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can our Chinese people complete the complete unification of the great motherland, achieve the complete victory of the great cause of liberation, and further safeguard peace in Asia and the world. We warmly support the great call of our Central People's Government to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We pledge to strengthen our work in all aspects with all our strength to accomplish this historical task.

In order to liberate Taiwan, all our compatriots throughout the country must strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, increase production, practice thrift, and increase labor productivity, and strive to complete and overfulfill the national construction plan!

In order to liberate Taiwan, all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces must strengthen political and military training, master modern military technology, carry forward revolutionary heroism, and strive for victory in every battle until the complete annihilation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique!

In order to liberate Taiwan, all our compatriots throughout the country, especially those in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong coastal areas and islands at the forefront of the struggle, must strengthen vigilance, eliminate special agents, and strive to support the People's Liberation Army's struggle against the enemy!

In order to liberate Taiwan, our Taiwan compatriots must inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition, carry forward patriotism, strengthen unity, accumulate strength, and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army!

The elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is inevitable. We must point out the way out for all those who have fled to Taiwan with Chiang. The policy of our Central People's Government is lenient: with the exception of Chiang Kai-shek, anyone is allowed to abandon darkness and turn to the light, return to the mainland and reunite with their families, and anyone can receive lenient treatment for meritorious service and atonement for crimes, with past misdeeds not being held against them.

The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a struggle to defend world peace. Justice is on our side, and the sympathy and support of the whole world are on our side. Our Chinese people will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory in the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

All the Chinese people, unite more firmly, and strive to liberate Taiwan, oppose American interference, safeguard national security, and defend world peace!

    中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言
    我们严正地向全世界宣告：台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。
    六十年前，日本帝国主义强占了台湾。中国人民进行了长期的斗争，终于在伟大抗日战争的胜利中，使台湾同胞在一九四五年十月二十五日回到了祖国的怀抱。中国人民决不能容忍蒋介石卖国集团窃据台湾，决不能容忍美国侵略集团侵占台湾。
    蒋介石卖国集团在美国政府庇护之下逃到台湾，把台湾变成了叛国者的巢穴。这个卖国集团几年来把台湾丰富的物产和资源出卖给美国政府，换取美国军事援助，并在台湾压迫爱国运动，屠杀爱国同胞，搜括人民财富，强迫青年充当炮灰，使我台湾同胞陷于水深火热之中。这个卖国集团对我海外华侨实行欺骗和迫害，掠夺华侨财产，引诱华侨青年参加匪军。这个卖国集团仗着美国海空军的庇护，袭击祖国沿海岛屿，轰炸祖国沿海城市，打劫祖国商船和与祖国通商的船舶，派遣特务进行暗害活动，抢劫和杀害渔民，不断地对祖国进行骚扰性的和破坏性的战争。这个卖国集团最近更阴谋与美国政府签订所谓“共同安全双边条约”，建立军事同盟，妄图配合美国武装力量，进攻祖国大陆，挑拨世界战争，使人类遭受空前的浩劫。这个卖国集团不仅是中国人民的公敌，而且是亚洲及世界各国人民的公敌。
    举世皆知，美国侵略集团一向敌视中华人民共和国。一九五零年六月，美国政府发动侵略朝鲜战争，加紧干涉印度支那战争，同时派遣美国第七舰队侵入台湾海峡，占我领土台湾。这样，美国政府就破坏了它自己参加签定的承认台湾是中国领土的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”。现在，朝鲜战争停止了，印度支那和平恢复了，国际紧张局势正在逐步趋于和缓。但是，美国侵略集团不甘心于自己的失败，却进一步地扶植蒋介石卖国集团，企图扩大对我国的武装干涉和战争威胁。美国侵略集团正在策划与蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同安全双边条约”，正在拼凑日本反动势力、李承晚集团和蒋介石卖国集团组织所谓“东北亚防御联盟”，并正在积极拉拢英法、策动西太平洋和东南亚某些国家组织所谓“东南亚防御集团”。美国侵略集团这一系列的阴谋活动，毫无疑义，是以中华人民共和国为主要敌对目标。
    中国人民是爱好和平的。中华人民共和国一贯执行着和平政策。周恩来总理兼外交部部长在一九五四年八月十一日的外交报告中说过：“中国没有侵略别国领土的意图，也决不容忍别国侵略中国的领土。中国没有侵犯别国主权的意图，也决不容忍别国侵犯中国的主权。中国没有干涉别国内政的意图，也决不容忍别国干涉中国的内政。中国决不威胁别国的安全，也决不容忍别国威胁中国的安全。”这是我们中国六万万人民的共同意志。
    为了保障祖国安全和领土完整，为了保障亚洲及世界的和平，中国人民一定要解放台湾。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，决不容许美国侵占，也决不容许联合国托管。解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，是行使中国的主权，是中国的内政，决不容许任何外国干涉。如果外国侵略者敢于阻挠中国人民解放台湾，那就是干涉中国的内政，侵犯中国的主权，破坏中国的领土完整，他们就必须承担这一侵略行为的一切严重后果。
    解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，是中国人民神圣的历史任务。只有把台湾从蒋介石卖国集团的暴政下解放出来，我中国人民才能完成伟大祖国的完全统一，才能获得伟大解放事业的完全胜利，才能进一步维护亚洲及世界的和平。我们热烈拥护我中央人民政府解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的伟大号召。我们誓以全力从各方面加强工作，以完成这个历史任务。
    为了解放台湾，我全国同胞必须加强团结，提高警惕，增加生产，厉行节约，提高劳动生产率，为争取完成和超额完成国家建设计划而奋斗！
    为了解放台湾，我人民解放军陆海空军全体指挥员和战斗员必须加强政治军事训练，掌握现代军事技术，发扬革命英雄主义，争取每一个战斗的胜利，直到蒋介石卖国集团的彻底消灭！
    为了解放台湾，我全国同胞，特别是处在斗争最前线的江苏、浙江、福建、广东沿海地区和岛屿的同胞，必须加强戒备，肃清特务，努力支援人民解放军的对敌斗争！
    为了解放台湾，我台湾同胞必须继承光荣的革命传统，发扬爱国主义，加强团结，积蓄力量，准备迎接人民解放军！
  蒋介石卖国集团的消灭是定了的。我们要对一切跟随蒋贼逃到台湾的人指明出路。我中央人民政府的政策是宽大的：除蒋贼一人而外，任何人都容许弃暗投明，回到大陆与家人团聚，任何人都可以受到立功赎罪、既往不究的宽大待遇。
    中国人民解放台湾的斗争就是保卫世界和平的斗争。正义在我们方面，全世界的同情和支持在我们方面。我中国人民在解放台湾的斗争中，一定能够克服一切困难，取得最后胜利。
    全中国人民更加坚强地团结起来，为解放台湾、反对美国干涉、保障祖国安全、保卫世界和平而奋斗！
