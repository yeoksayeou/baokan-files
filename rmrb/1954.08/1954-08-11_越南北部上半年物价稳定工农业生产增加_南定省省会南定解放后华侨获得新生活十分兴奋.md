Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: According to Vietnam News Agency on August 8th, in order to help increase production and improve the people's living conditions, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam vigorously adopted measures to stabilize prices, collect and purchase forest and agricultural products, and develop handicrafts and small industries in the first half of this year, and has achieved success in North Vietnam.

    In terms of stabilizing prices, the prices of major products, especially rice, salt, and cloth, are generally quite stable. Rice prices rose slightly in some provinces in April, but due to measures taken by state-owned trading enterprises, they fell to reasonable levels by June. Salt prices have generally decreased significantly due to sufficient supplies to all parts of North Vietnam. Cloth prices are stable in almost all provinces of North Vietnam. In the Viet Bac Interzone, the amount of cloth sold by state-owned trading enterprises in the first half of this year doubled compared to the same period in 1953. Due to stable prices, people no longer lack daily necessities as they did in the past.

    In terms of collecting and purchasing forest and agricultural products, the prices of products have increased due to a series of measures taken by relevant government departments to encourage them. For example, in Phu Tho, one kilogram of tea was worth about 800 Vietnamese Dong at the beginning of this year, but by May it had risen to 1,200 Vietnamese Dong. As the income of working farmers increases, they can buy more daily necessities.

    In terms of developing handicrafts and small industries, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce formulated a plan at the beginning of this year and has partially implemented it in the first half of this year. The weaving industry has developed in many areas. In the first five months of this year, baskets worth approximately 112 million Vietnamese Dong were sold to the French-occupied zone. The government paid special attention to the production of agricultural tools and provided assistance to producers in many ways; as a result, the production of agricultural tools increased and the prices of finished products decreased.

    The above-mentioned activities of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce have significantly helped improve the living conditions of working farmers. They are enthusiastically launching a production increase movement.

   Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: According to a Vietnam News Agency reporter from the newly liberated Nam Dinh Province's capital, Nam Dinh, Nam Dinh is one of the North Vietnamese cities with the largest number of overseas Chinese. They number about two thousand, including workers and business people. After Nam Dinh was liberated on July 1st, the overseas Chinese were very excited after getting rid of the oppression of the reactionaries. They also warmly welcomed the restoration of peace in Indochina.

    Every day, overseas Chinese come to the municipal library to read books and visit pictures illustrating the patriotic war of the Vietnamese people or the achievements of the new China's national construction. Overseas Chinese worker Wen Guangyu (transliteration) said after visiting the pictures of the Huai River harnessing project: We used to live in the lies of the reactionaries, like blind and deaf people. Now we are beginning to know the new face of our beloved motherland.

    Now overseas Chinese can freely express their love for their motherland. The Nam Dinh Overseas Chinese Organization wrote a letter to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on July 17th, expressing their confidence in the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong's leadership.

    The policies adopted by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the newly liberated cities to protect industry and commerce and protect the lives and property of foreigners exposed the deceptive propaganda of the imperialist warmongers. After liberation, overseas Chinese merchants reopened their shops, and now business is gradually returning to normal.

    Vietnamese-Chinese friendship is growing day by day in a warm atmosphere. From the day Nam Dinh was liberated, overseas Chinese workers and students actively helped Vietnamese residents clean up the city. At a meeting held by Nam Dinh residents at the end of July to celebrate the liberation of Nam Dinh and the restoration of peace in Indochina, an overseas Chinese said to his Vietnamese brothers: Your victory is also our victory. The peace in Indochina also reduces the threat of war to our motherland. After the liberation of Nam Dinh, we will no longer suffer from the plunder and extortion of the reactionaries.

    越南北部上半年物价稳定工农业生产增加
    南定省省会南定解放后华侨获得新生活十分兴奋
    【新华社十日讯】据越南通讯社八日讯：越南民主共和国政府工商部为了有助于增加生产和改善人民生活条件，在今年上半年大力采取了稳定物价、收集和购买林产品和农产品、发展手工业和小工业等措施，已在北越取得了成就。
    在稳定物价方面，主要产品的价格，特别是大米、盐和布匹的价格一般都是相当稳定的。大米的价格，有些省份在四月份曾略为上涨，但由于国营贸易企业采取措施，到六月就降到合理的价格了。盐，由于对北越各地供应的充分，价格已普遍地大大降低了。布匹的价格，在北越几乎所有的省份中都是稳定的。在越北联区，国营贸易企业售出的布匹数量，今年上半年比一九五三年同时期增加了一倍。由于物价稳定，人民不再像过去那样缺少日用必需品了。
    在收集和购买林产品和农产品方面，由于政府有关部门采取了一系列的措施来加以鼓励，使产品的价格提高了。例如，在富寿一公斤茶叶今年年初的时候约值八百越南币，而到五月份已上升到一千二百越南币。劳动农民的收入增加后，就可以购买更多的日用必需品。
    在发展手工业和小工业方面，工商部在今年年初制订了计划，并在今年上半年中已部分地执行了。编织业在很多地区得到了发展。在今年头五个月中，有价值约一亿一千二百万越南币的篮子销售到法占区。政府对农具的生产特别予以注意，对生产者多方面地给以帮助；因而农具的生产增加了，成品价格降低了。
    工商部的上述活动已显著地帮助了劳动农民生活条件的改善。他们正在热烈地展开增产运动。
   【新华社十日讯】据越南通讯社记者自新解放的南定省省会南定报道，南定是华侨最多的北越城市之一。他们约有两千人，包括工人和企业界人士。南定在七月一日解放后，华侨在摆脱了反动派的压迫以后是十分兴奋的。他们并对印度支那恢复和平表示热烈欢迎。
    每天都有华侨到市立图书馆来阅读书籍和参观说明越南人民爱国战争或新中国国家建设成就的图片。华侨工人温光宇（译音）在参观了治淮工程的图片后说：我们过去生活在反动派的谎言的罗网里面，像瞎子和聋子一样。现在我们才开始知道我们可爱的祖国的新面目。
    现在华侨已能自由地表达他们对祖国的热爱。南定华侨的组织在七月十七日写信给中华人民共和国中央人民政府，表示他们对中华人民共和国中央人民政府、中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导的信心。
    越南民主共和国政府在新解放城市所采取的保护工商业和保护外侨生命财产的政策，揭穿了帝国主义战争贩子的欺骗宣传。解放以后，华侨商人又打开了他们的店门，现在生意正在逐渐恢复正常状态。
    越中友谊在热烈的气氛中一天比一天增进。从南定解放那一天起，华侨工人和学生就积极帮助越南居民清扫这个城市。在南定居民于七月底开会庆祝南定的解放和印度支那和平恢复时，一个华侨对他的越南兄弟说：你们的胜利也就是我们的胜利。印度支那的和平也使我们祖国减少战争的威胁。南定解放以后，我们就不再遭受反动派的掠夺和讹诈了。
