Yunnan Provincial People's Congress Passes Resolution Requiring Changes to Place Names that Discriminate Against and Insult Ethnic Minorities

The First Session of the First Yunnan Provincial People's Congress passed a resolution requiring the change of place names that discriminate against and insult ethnic minorities.

Yunnan Province is a multi-ethnic region, and the reactionary ruling era left behind many place names with discriminatory and insulting meanings towards ethnic minorities. Recently, the names of six counties have been approved for change: Pingyi County to Fuyuan County, Xuanwei County to Rongfeng County, Mianning County to Lincang County, Menghua County to Weishan County, Zhennan County to Nanhua County, and Shunping County to Fengqing County. However, there are still some place names that have not been changed. The representatives of the twenty-eight ethnic groups attending the congress, based on the proposals of representatives from Lijiang and other places, made a "Resolution on Changing Place Names that Discriminate Against and Insult Ethnic Minorities." The congress instructed the relevant regions to seriously review the place names in accordance with the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government, and, through full deliberation and consultation with the relevant ethnic representatives, submit specific handling opinions to the relevant levels of the People's Congress or People's Representative Conference for approval and implementation by the higher authorities.

    云南省首届人民代表大会会议通过决议
    要求更改歧视侮辱少数民族的地方名称
    云南省首届人民代表大会第一次会议通过决议，要求更改歧视、侮辱少数民族的地方名称。
    云南省是多民族地区，反动统治时代遗留下许多带有歧视、侮辱少数民族意义的地方名称。最近已经批准更改了六个县名：平彝县改为富源县，宣威县改为榕峰县，缅宁县改为临沧县，蒙化县改为巍山县，镇南县改为南华县，顺宁县改为凤庆县；但还有一些地方称谓未作更改。出席代表大会会议的二十八个民族的代表，根据丽江等地代表的提案，作出了“关于更改歧视、侮辱少数民族的地方名称的决议”。大会责成各有关地区，根据中央人民政府政务院的指示，认真进行审查，通过和有关民族代表的充分酝酿协商，由有关各级人民代表大会或人民代表会议提出具体处理意见，报请上级批准实行。
