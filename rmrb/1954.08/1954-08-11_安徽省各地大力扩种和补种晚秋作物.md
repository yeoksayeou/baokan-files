The broad masses of peasants in Anqing, Wuhu, Su County, Fuyang, Lu'an and other special districts in Anhui Province are vigorously carrying out the replanting and expansion of late autumn crops.

The Anqing Special District had expanded its cultivated land area by more than 400,000 mu by August 6. It also achieved simultaneous reclamation and planting of late autumn crops. Before August 1, the average number of people participating in reclamation in the entire special district was only about 3,000 per day. After August 1, the number of people participating in reclamation increased sharply. By August 5, the number of people participating in reclamation had increased to more than 460,000, with an average daily expansion of cultivated land area of 100,000 mu.

In Wuhu Special District, as of August 4, according to incomplete statistics, 300,000 people in the entire special district participated in land reclamation every day, and more than 378,000 mu of wasteland had been reclaimed. In the movement to expand the area of cultivated land, leading cadres at all levels were able to go deep into mobilization and take action themselves. For example, Zhan Xianyu, the head of Hanshan County, personally went to the Xianzong District to lead the increase in production through land reclamation. In four days, the county had reclaimed more than 23,400 mu of wasteland, some of which had been planted with late autumn crops such as corn. For example, in Situ Township, 420 people reclaimed and planted 110 mu of late autumn crops such as corn in one day under the slogan of "reclaiming and planting simultaneously."

The counties in the Lu'an Special District plan to expand the cultivated land by 1.08 million mu, most of which has now been completed. Some places have already delivered manure to the fields in preparation for planting.

Under the leadership of the local Party committees and people's governments, the broad masses of peasants in Su County and Fuyang Special Districts are also carrying out drainage and replanting work intensely. The peasants in various places are very enthusiastic about draining water, replanting, and striving for increased production. The waterlogging in five districts including Hugou in Su County has been basically drained. Su County and Lingbi County have replanted more than 180,000 mu of soybeans, buckwheat, sweet potatoes, carrots, etc. The replanting work in Suixi County has also been fully launched. In the waterlogged areas of Fuyang Special District, most of the accumulated water has receded or been drained. In areas where the water receded earlier, farmers have replanted more than 552,000 mu of various late autumn crops.

    安徽省各地大力扩种和补种晚秋作物
    安徽省安庆、芜湖、宿县、阜阳、六安等专区的广大农民，大力进行补种、扩种晚秋作物。
    安庆专区至八月六日止，已扩大耕地面积四十多万亩。并做到一边开垦、一边种植晚秋作物。八月一日以前，全专区每日平均参加开垦的人数只有三千左右，八月一日以后参加开垦的人数急遽增加，到八月五日，每日参加开垦的人数已增加到四十六万多人，每天平均扩大耕地面积十万亩。
    芜湖专区到八月四日止，据不完全统计，全专区每天有三十万人参加开荒，已开垦荒地三十七万八千多亩。在扩大耕地面积运动中，各级领导干部都能深入动员，亲自动手。如含山县县长湛先余同志，亲自到仙踪区领导开荒增产，在四天内，全县已开垦二万三千四百多亩荒地，其中一部分并已播种上晚秋作物。如司徒乡四百二十人，在“边开边种”的口号下，在一天内就连开带种了一百一十亩玉米等晚秋作物。
    六安专区各县计划扩大耕地一百零八万亩，目前已大部完成。有的地方已在送粪下地，准备播种。
    宿县、阜阳两专区的广大农民，在当地党委和人民政府领导下，也在紧张地进行排涝补种。各地农民对排涝补种及争取增产的劲头很大，宿县湖沟等五个区的积水已基本排完。宿县和灵璧县已共补种?豆、荞麦、山芋、胡萝卜等十八万多亩。濉溪县的补种工作也已全面开展。阜阳专区内涝地区的积水已大部退落或排出，落水较早的地区，农民已补种各种晚秋作物五十五万二千多亩。
