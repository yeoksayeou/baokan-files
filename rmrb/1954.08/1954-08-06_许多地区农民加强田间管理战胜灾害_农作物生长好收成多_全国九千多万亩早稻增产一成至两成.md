    Farmers in Many Regions Strengthen Field Management to Overcome Disasters
    Good Crop Growth and Abundant Harvests
    National Early Rice Production on More Than 90 Million Mu Increases by 10% to 20%
    This year, early rice crops across the country have generally achieved bumper harvests. According to statistics and estimates from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the yield of early rice on more than 90 million mu nationwide may increase by 10% to 20% compared to last year. In provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, as well as in the double-cropping rice areas of the Yangtze River basin, the early rice has been widely harvested, and the early seasonal new grain has already entered the market. The more than 30 million mu of early rice in Guangdong Province has now been completely harvested, with an increase of more than 15% compared to last year. The early rice in the Hainan area has increased by 10% to 25% compared to last year. In provinces such as Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, with the exception of some areas affected by floods, early rice crops in most areas have grown well and will be completely harvested by early August. It is estimated that they will also increase by more than 10% compared to last year.

    Northeast Summer Hoeing Ends, Crop Growth is Good
    As a result of the efforts of farmers in the Northeast to carry out summer hoeing, various crops are generally growing well. Wheat is being harvested successively in various places, and good harvest reports are frequently received. In the main wheat-producing area, the former Heilongjiang Province, it is estimated that wheat production will exceed last year. In the former Songjiang Province, more than 400,000 hectares (each hectare equals 15 Chinese mu) of wheat can produce an average of about 1,600 jin per hectare, an increase of 190 jin compared to last year. In the former Liaodong Province, 47,000 hectares of wheat can produce an average of about 1,500 jin per hectare, exceeding the normal yield by 8% to 10%, and an increase of about 30% compared to last year. Corn, soybeans, sorghum, millet, rice, and other crops are also growing normally in various places. After vigorous pest control in the cotton fields of the former Liaodong, former Liaoxi, and Rehe provinces, the cotton seedlings have recovered their growth. At present, with the exception of individual areas in the north, the entire Northeast region has mostly finished hoeing. Farmers in various places are continuing to strengthen field management and flood prevention, pest control, and other work to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest.

    Hebei's More Than 100 Million Mu of Crops Are Expected to Increase Production
    After farmers strengthened field management in July, most of Hebei Province's 110 million mu of crops are expected to increase production. The various crops in the nine special districts of Hebei Province, with the exception of some areas in the Tianjin, Tongxian, and Tangshan special districts where growth is relatively poor, generally grow no less well than last year. The crops in the mountainous areas are growing particularly well due to suitable rainfall. The robustness of seedlings in the Zhangjiakou special district is unprecedented in the past two or three years. Among various crops, corn and soybeans are growing the best, followed by cotton, peanuts, and tubers. At present, grain and oil crops have begun to flower and bear fruit, and cotton is forming bolls. In about a month, early-maturing millet, corn, etc., will begin to be harvested. In order to increase the harvest of grain, cotton, and oil crops, Party and government organs at all levels in Hebei Province are leading farmers to further process and apply fertilizer.

    Hetao Area Can Increase Grain Production by 100 Million Jin
    After a bumper harvest was predicted for the million mu of spring wheat in the Hetao area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the autumn crops are growing well. Millet grows lush and sturdy, generally more than two chi (approximately 2/3 meter) tall, and has begun to put forth panicles. Except for some areas affected by insect pests, flax is also growing particularly well this year, and it is estimated that the yield per mu can increase by 4% compared to last year. Leguminous crops are bearing full pods and are nearing maturity. It is estimated that the region can increase grain production by 100 million jin compared to last year. This year, under the leadership of 50 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 8,500 mutual aid teams, farmers of all ethnic groups in the Hetao area have generally carried out seed selection, increased the amount and area of fertilization, and rationally implemented close planting. During the seedling growth period, farmers also carried out a series of field management tasks such as timely irrigation, early and careful weeding, and topdressing, and fought against various diseases and insect pests, saving tens of thousands of mu of crops from damage.

    Henan Farmers Apply Topdressing to Autumn Fields
    This year, the area of closely planted autumn fields and the area of replanting on wheat stubble land in Henan Province have increased compared to previous years. In order to strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn, people's governments at all levels in Henan Province are leading farmers to carry out a movement to accumulate fertilizer and apply topdressing to autumn fields. When studying and arranging production work, special commissioner's offices and county people's governments have adopted effective measures to address the issue of fertilizer accumulation. Anyang County, through carrying out the movement to tap potential and find methods, according to statistics from 104 villages in seven districts, has already accumulated more than 1.5 million cartloads of green manure; 50% to 80% of the cotton and millet in the county has been topdressed. Because farmers in Puyang, Nanle, Neihuang, Qingfeng, Fengqiu, Changyuan, and other counties have accumulated more coarse fertilizer this year, 20% to 30% of the late autumn crop fields have been topdressed. The tiled-urn type manure-collecting method created by Zhang Benzi of Mengjin County is being promoted throughout the province's mutual aid and cooperative organizations and areas with a good foundation for fertilizer accumulation.

    Shaanxi Farmers Greet the Harvest with Full Confidence
    Shaanxi Province's 35 million mu of autumn crops and cotton are growing well. At present, the early-planted corn and sorghum in the central and southern regions are bearing fruit, and the 2 million mu of early corn in the Ankang special district has begun to be harvested. The millet in the north has grown to more than two chi tall. The rice in the Han River basin in the south is lush and strong, and is generally pregnant with ears. The more than 3 million mu of cotton on the Guanzhong Plain, except for some affected by insect pests, have generally formed five or six cotton bolls and will begin to fluff in half a month. Corn, millet, broomcorn millet, and beans and other crops planted later in various parts of the province, are also very flourishing. Farmers are full of confidence and say: this year's autumn fields will be like wheat, another bumper harvest season.

    Gansu Has Favorable Weather and Sturdy Seedlings Everywhere
    Gansu Province has recently experienced continuous welcome rains, and most of the more than 20 million mu of autumn fields have sturdy seedlings, promising a good harvest. At present, potatoes have generally blossomed in various places, and oil crops are also growing very well. In the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region, where more oil crops are planted, more than 400,000 mu of flax are blossoming and bearing seeds, and some have already matured. The corn in the eastern and southern regions is also tasseling and bearing fruit, and some areas have already matured; sorghum is five or six chi tall. The millet and broomcorn millet in the Hexi Corridor are generally more than one chi tall, and some of the early-planted millet has begun to put forth panicles. In order to strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn, farmers of all ethnic groups in the province are working hard to strengthen field management.

    Ningxia's 600,000 Mu of Rice Grow Vigorously
    Ningxia Province's approximately 600,000 mu of rice is growing vigorously, promising increased production. Rice sown by some mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives using the dry direct-seeding method is now more than two chi tall and is pregnant with ears and putting forth panicles. Ordinary rice has also grown to one and a half chi tall and is about to be pregnant with ears and put forth panicles. The rice fields have now generally been weeded three to four times. Some mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives have also applied topdressing.

    Crops on the Kangzang Plateau Grow Luxuriantly
    Since the beginning of summer, the Kangzang Plateau has had abundant rainfall, and crops throughout the region are growing well. At present, in the main agricultural areas such as the Lhasa River valley and along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, highland barley and wheat are earing, rapeseed is beginning to set seed, and farmers have generally eaten fresh and tender potatoes and turnips. In the Qamdo area, wheat has turned yellow and peas have full pods. In the cold highland areas upstream of the rivers, the sturdy wheat seedlings are fluttering in the wind. In the warmer areas on the southern slopes of the Gangdise Mountains and in the lower reaches of the Nujiang and Lancang Rivers in the Bomi area, the first season of highland barley, wheat, and other crops has been harvested, and the general harvest has reached 15 times the seed yield. Farmers say this is the best harvest in ten years. Now, the autumn crops of buckwheat, millet, etc., are being sown in these areas, and some have already emerged. In the various farms of the People's Liberation Army, various crops are growing particularly well this year due to careful cultivation. When the weather clears after rain, the soldiers are busy weeding and applying fertilizer.

    Fujian Farmers Strive for a Ten-Tenths Harvest in a Ten-Tenths Year
    During this year's summer harvest, farmers in various parts of Fujian Province have changed their thinking of "a great harvest in the fields, what does it matter if birds peck at it," and have come up with various ways to carefully harvest and strive for a "ten-tenths harvest in a ten-tenths year." Before the summer harvest began, various places organized many elderly people and children, as well as established hunting teams, to guard the soon-to-be-ripe rice fields to prevent the early rice from being damaged by birds, beasts, and livestock. During the harvest, various places put forward the slogan "every grain returns home," paying special attention to light cutting and gentle placement, so as not to casually discard or waste the grains obtained through hard work during a bumper year. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places actively played a leading role in the summer harvest, and united and helped individual farmers to harvest as soon as the crops were ripe.

    许多地区农民加强田间管理战胜灾害
    农作物生长好收成多
    全国九千多万亩早稻增产一成至两成
    今年全国各地早稻普遍获得丰收。据中央人民政府农业部的统计和估计，全国九千多万亩早稻产量可比去年增产一成到二成。广东、广西、福建等省及长江流域的双季稻区，早稻已普遍收割，季节较早的新谷已经登场。广东省的三千多万亩早稻现已收割完毕，比去年增产一成半以上，海南区的早稻比去年增产一成至二成半。四川、湖南、湖北、江西、安徽、浙江、江苏等省除部分地区遭受水灾外，大部地区早稻都生长良好，八月上旬就可全部收割完毕，据估计也可比去年增产一成以上。
    东北夏锄结束农作物生长良好
    东北区农民努力夏锄的结果，各种农作物普遍生长良好。各地小麦正陆续收割，丰收捷报频传。主要产麦区原黑龙江省，估计小麦产量将超过去年。原松江省四十多万垧（每垧合十五市亩）小麦，平均每垧可产一千六百斤左右，比去年增产一百九十斤。原辽东省四万七千垧小麦，平均每垧可产一千五百斤左右，超过常年产量百分之八到十，比去年增产百分之三十左右。各地玉米、大豆、高粱、谷子、水稻等也都生长正常。原辽东、原辽西和热河等省的棉田经过大力治虫后，棉苗已恢复生长。目前东北区除北部个别地区还在铲?外，全区已大部挂锄。各地农民正继续加强田间管理和防汛、治虫等工作，争取全面丰收。
    河北一亿多亩农作物增产有望
    经过七月份农民加强田间管理，河北省一亿一千多万亩农作物绝大部分增产有望。河北省九个专区的各种农作物，除天津、通县、唐山三个专区的部分地区生长较差外，一般长得不下于去年。山区的农作物因雨水适宜，生长尤其良好。张家口专区禾苗的茁壮情况，为近两三年来所未有。各种农作物中，以玉米、大豆生长最好，其次是棉花、花生和薯类。目前粮食、油料作物已开花结实，棉花正在结铃。大约一个月后，早熟的谷子、玉米等就要开始收割。为了提高粮食、棉花、油料的收成，河北省各级党、政机关正领导农民进一步加工加肥。
    河套地区可增产一亿斤粮食
    内蒙古自治区黄河河套地区百万亩春小麦预告丰收后，大秋作物生长良好。糜子长得葱绿茁壮，一般都有二尺多高，开始吐穗；胡麻除部分遭受虫灾外，今年也长得特别好，预计每亩可比去年增产百分之四；豆类作物结荚累累，已近成熟。预计今年全区可比去年增产一亿斤粮食。河套地区各族农民，今年在五十个农业生产合作社和八千五百多个互助组的带动下，普遍进行选种，增加施肥量和施肥面积，合理地实行了密植。在幼苗生长期间，农民们又进行适时灌溉、早锄细锄、追肥等一系列的田间管理工作，并和各种病虫害作斗争，使数万亩作物免受损害。
    河南农民对秋田增施追肥
    今年河南省秋田密植的面积和麦茬地的复种面积，都比往年增加。为了争取秋季丰收，河南省各级人民政府正领导农民开展积肥和秋田增施追肥的运动。各专署和县人民政府在研究和安排生产工作时，对积肥问题都采取了有效措施。安阳县通过开展挖潜力、找窍门运动，据七个区一百零四个村的统计，已积青肥一百五十多万车；全县有百分之五十到八十的棉花、谷子已施过追肥。濮阳、南乐、内黄、清丰、封邱、长垣等县因为今年农民积粗肥多，有百分之二十到三十的晚秋作物田已施上了追肥。孟津县张本资创造的瓦瓮式茅池积尿肥法，正在全省互助合作组织和积肥基础较好的地区推广。
      陕西农民满怀信心迎接丰收
    陕西省三千五百多万亩大秋作物和棉花生长良好。目前中部和南部早种的玉米、高粱正在结实，安康专区二百多万亩早玉米已开始收割。北部的谷子已长到二尺多高。南部汉水流域水稻葱绿健壮，普遍孕穗。关中平原三百多万亩棉花，除部分受虫害影响外，一般已结五、六个棉铃，再有半个月就可开始吐絮。全省各地播种较晚的玉米、谷子、糜子以及豆类等作物，苗株也都很繁茂。农民们满怀信心说：今年的秋田将和小麦一样，又是一季丰收。
    甘肃各地风调雨顺禾苗茁壮
    甘肃省各地最近连降喜雨，两千多万亩秋田大部分禾苗茁壮，可望丰收。目前各地马铃薯已普遍开花，油料作物也生长很好。种植油料作物较多的西海固回族自治区，四十多万亩胡麻正在开花结籽，有的已经成熟。东部和南部的玉米也在吐缨结实，个别地区已经成熟；高粱有五、六尺高。河西走廊的谷子、糜子一般有一尺多高，有些早种的谷子已开始吐穗。为争取秋田丰收，全省各族农民正在努力加强田间管理。
    宁夏六十万亩水稻生长旺盛
    宁夏省约六十万亩水稻生长旺盛，增产有望。有些互助组和农业生产合作社采用旱直播方法播种的水稻，目前已有二尺多高，正在孕穗、吐穗。一般水稻也长到一尺半高，快要孕穗、吐穗了。现在稻田已普遍薅过三次到四次。有的互助组和农业生产合作社还施了追肥。
      康藏高原农作物蓬勃生长
    入夏以来康藏高原雨水充沛，全区农作物生长良好。目前，拉萨河谷、雅鲁藏布江沿岸等主要农业区，青稞、小麦正在抽穗，油菜开始结籽，农民们已普遍吃到鲜嫩的马铃薯和元根。昌都地区的麦子已经发黄、豌豆也饱荚。江、河上游的高寒地带，茁壮的麦苗正迎风翻浪。在冈底斯山南麓、波密地区怒江和澜沧江下游河谷等温暖地带，第一季的青稞、小麦等庄稼已收割完毕，一般收成达到种籽的十五倍，农民们说这是十年来最好的收成。现在这些地区的荞麦、谷子等秋季作物正在下种，有的已经出土。在人民解放军的各个农场里，由于今年做到精耕细作，各种作物生长得特别好。雨过天晴时，战士们正忙着除草和施运肥料。
    福建农民争取十成年景十成收
    福建省各地农民在今年夏收中改变了“田园大熟，何在鸟啄”的思想，想出各种办法精打细收，争取“十成年景十成收”。在夏收开始前，各地就组织许多老人和小孩，以及成立打猎队，看管即将成熟的稻田，不使早稻遭受鸟兽和家畜的损害。收割中各地提出“颗粒还家”的口号，特别注意轻割轻放，不使丰年辛勤所得的谷粒随便抛撒糟蹋。各地农业生产合作社和互助组在夏收中积极发挥带头作用，并团结和帮助单干农民，做到随熟随割。
