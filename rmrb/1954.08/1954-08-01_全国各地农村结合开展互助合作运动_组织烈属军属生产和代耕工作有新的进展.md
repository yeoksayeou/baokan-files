    Rural Areas Across the Country Combine to Carry Out Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movements; New Progress in Organizing the Production of Families of Martyrs and Servicemen and Substitute Farming Work
    In the first half of this year, rural areas across the country conscientiously implemented the guiding principles on preferential treatment work in the resolution of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference, and made new progress in vigorously organizing families of martyrs and servicemen to participate in production and rectifying substitute farming work in conjunction with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    The number of families of martyrs and servicemen, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers participating in agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various regions has greatly increased. According to statistics from sixty-three counties (banners) and another four thousand two hundred and nineteen townships (towns, villages) in twenty-one provinces and cities including Shanxi, Henan, and Fujian, the proportion of families of martyrs and servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations has reached 62.2%, generally increasing by 15% to 20% compared to 1953. In many areas, this has even exceeded the proportion of local masses organized. Particularly in Northeast and North China and other regions with a better foundation for mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the growth rate of the number of families of martyrs and servicemen joining groups and cooperatives is even more significant. In some counties in Shanxi and Rehe provinces, it has reached 80% to 90%. Some families of martyrs and servicemen who previously relied on substitute farming and material subsidies and never participated in production have now voluntarily declined or applied to reduce substitute farming and signed up to join groups and cooperatives.
    In order to help families of martyrs and servicemen create conditions for participating in production, many regions have concentrated the use of preferential treatment funds to solve the difficulties of some impoverished families of martyrs and servicemen lacking means of production. Five provinces including Hebei, Jiangsu, Liaoxi, Rehe, and Shaanxi distributed a total of 38 billion yuan in preferential treatment funds this spring to purchase a large number of draught animals, farm tools, and fertilizers, etc., to help them participate in production. The 1.88 billion yuan distributed in ten counties and cities including Fuxin in Liaoxi Province in the first half of this year has solved the specific difficulties of more than 19,540 impoverished families of martyrs and servicemen and demobilized soldiers participating in production.
    Many regions, while organizing families of martyrs and servicemen to participate in production, have also rectified substitute farming work. The Northeast provinces mobilized families of martyrs and servicemen with labor and livestock to participate in production, reducing the proportion of substitute farming land from about 28% to about 25%. Hebei and Shanxi provinces focused on correcting the tendency of excessively compressing the area of substitute farming land in 1953, and all families of martyrs and servicemen who were entitled to substitute farming were given it, so the area of substitute farming land generally increased slightly compared to last year, except in a few areas.
    This year, various regions have further promoted the combination of substitute farming and mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In 481 townships in five counties of Shanxi Province, including Pingshun, Lingchuan, Tunliu, Huguan, and Licheng, families of martyrs and servicemen whose land is farmed by mutual aid and cooperative organizations have reached 94%, basically eliminating the backward form of temporary assignment of labor for substitute farming. In areas with a better foundation for mutual aid and cooperation organizations, such as Hebei, Shanxi, and Rehe provinces, agricultural production cooperatives generally farm about 20% of the total substitute farming land this year; this proportion has approached 50% in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province. In areas with a weaker foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, such as Central South, Southwest, and East China, the method of "first fixing the land to households, then combining it into groups" for substitute farming has also been widely promoted, gradually reducing the phenomenon of no one being responsible for substitute farming land in the past.

    全国各地农村结合开展互助合作运动
    组织烈属军属生产和代耕工作有新的进展
    今年上半年全国各地农村认真贯彻了第二次全国民政会议决议中关于优抚工作的方针，在结合开展互助合作运动大力组织烈属、军属参加生产和整顿代耕工作方面，有了新的进展。
    各地烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人参加农业生产和互助合作组织的户数已有很大的增加。据山西、河南、福建等二十一个省、市的六十三个县（旗）另四千二百一十九个乡（镇、村）的统计，参加互助合作组织的烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人占其总户数的比例已达百分之六十二点二，一般比一九五三年增加了百分之十五到百分之二十。不少地区并已超过当地群众组织起来的户数的比例。特别是东北、华北等互助合作组织基础较好的地区，烈属、军属入组、入社的户数增长速度就更为显著。山西、热河两省有的县已达百分之八十到九十。有些过去依靠代耕和实物补助从不参加生产的烈属、军属，现在已自动谢绝或申请减少代耕，报名入组入社。
    为了帮助烈属、军属创造参加生产的条件，许多地区集中地使用优抚事业费，解决了部分贫苦烈属、军属缺乏生产资料的困难。河北、江苏、辽西、热河、陕西等五省今春共发放了优抚事业费三百八十亿元，购买了大批耕畜、农具和肥料等，扶助他们参加生产。辽西省阜新等十个县、市今年上半年已发下的十八亿八千多万元，就使一万九千五百四十多名贫苦烈属、军属和复员军人参加生产的具体困难得到解决。
    许多地区在结合组织烈属、军属参加生产的同时，对代耕工作也进行了整顿。东北各省动员有劳力、畜力的烈属、军属参加了生产，使代耕土地面积的比例由百分之二十八降低到百分之二十五左右。山西、河北两省今年着重纠正了一九五三年过分压缩代耕土地面积的偏向，对应享受代耕的烈属、军属都予以代耕，因此代耕土地面积除少数地区外，一般比去年略有提高。
    今年各地还进一步推广了代耕和互助合作组织相结合的代耕形式。在山西省平顺、陵川、屯留、壶关、黎城等五个县的四百八十一个乡中，土地由互助合作组织代耕的烈属、军属户已达百分之九十四，基本上消灭了落后的临时派工的代耕形式。河北、山西、热河等省互助合作组织基础较好的地区，今年代耕土地由农业生产合作社代耕的一般占代耕土地总数的百分之二十左右；这种比例在山西省平顺县则已接近百分之五十。在互助合作基础较差的地区，如中南、西南、华东等地，也大量推广了把代耕土地“先固定到户，再结合到组”的代耕办法，逐渐减少了过去代耕土地无人负责的现象。
