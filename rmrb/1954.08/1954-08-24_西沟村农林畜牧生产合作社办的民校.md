The people's school in Xigou Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, began as a winter school in 1942 and was converted into a year-round people's school in 1952. It has a history of twelve years. By consistently adhering to the principle of serving production, the winter school and the people's school in Xigou Village have grown from small beginnings, gradually consolidating and developing. This year, on the basis of the village's collectivization, the production cooperative is running the people's school, further integrating the farmers' spare-time education with production work; from now on, the people's school in Xigou Village has entered a new stage.

Xigou Village has fifty-three households with two hundred and thirty-seven people. In the old society, it was an extremely poor place, and people could only manage a "half-year of bran and vegetable rations" in good years. Only three people in the village had attended elementary school, and the best of them knew no more than a thousand characters. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of Xigou Village implemented rent and interest reduction and land reform. Under the guidance of Li Shunda, a national agricultural labor model, they organized mutual aid teams from 1943, embarking on the path of mutual aid and cooperation. In 1951, the mutual aid team developed into the Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. With the development of production, the poor valley became a rich valley, and the people's lives greatly improved. As a result of profit distribution within the cooperative in 1953, the income of the members generally exceeded that of 1952 (only three households did not exceed it due to special difficulties), and more than half of the households exceeded it by 30 to 200 percent.

The farmers' spare-time education work in Xigou Village has gradually developed along with the recovery and development of the economy. In 1942, Xigou Village carried out rent and interest reduction work, and in order to conduct political and ideological education among the farmers, a winter school was established. In the following years, the winter school played an active role in educating the farmers and raising the class consciousness of the masses in supporting the front lines and land reform and other central tasks. In 1951, the Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative was established. As a result of implementing land shares, planned production, and collective labor, many new problems requiring culture emerged, such as workpoint recording for the small groups, bookkeeping for the custodians, and technical studies for the technicians, and therefore, the masses' demand for cultural learning increased. Therefore, on the basis of carrying out literacy campaigns in the following year, the winter school was transformed into a year-round people's school. By the winter of 1953, illiteracy among young people in the village had been basically eliminated, and non-illiterates among adults accounted for 23 percent. Six of the seven main cadres of the cooperative (the cooperative director, deputy director, and section chiefs) had changed from illiterate to non-illiterate. About thirty people in the village could read the "North China People's" and "Shanxi Peasants'" newspapers, write notes, and keep workpoint accounts.

In the winter of 1953, after publicizing the state's general task during the transition period, the masses' level of consciousness was further raised, and the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative expanded from the original forty-seven households to two hundred and three households. The new situation of the expansion of the production cooperative and the development of production brought new problems: namely, people's demand for cultural learning greatly increased. The cooperative members, especially the young people, generally felt that not only was it necessary to improve culture to run the agricultural production cooperative well at present, but also, in order to realize the ideal of agricultural mechanization, it was necessary to further improve culture. And the cadres felt this even more deeply. For example, Fang Jusheng, the forestry section chief, was unable to grasp technical issues such as cultivating seedlings, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests and other natural disasters, and how many trees should be planted per square mu, due to his low cultural level. Although the higher authorities had issued some popular books explaining these technologies, he had only just learned a thousand or so characters, and he could not understand many places. He said: "The task of cultivating forestry in the whole cooperative is on my shoulders. It won't work if I don't study hard." Zhang Xiaobian, the head of the farming brigade, can now recognize 1,700 or 1,800 single characters (he originally only knew fifty characters), but he has difficulty writing and doesn't know arithmetic. However, the cooperative has implemented a contracting system based on fixed work, fixed personnel, fixed time, and fixed quantity, which is contracted to labor groups. This work is very complicated and requires calculating land, yield, labor, and fertilizer. There are also many forms such as "Production Input Form," "Fertilizer Application Form," and "Workpoint Recording Form." If this work is not done well, it will affect the production of the entire team. He also felt very strenuous, feeling that if he didn't study, he would be left behind by the work. Those in charge of overall work, such as Li Shunda and Shen Jilan, felt even more deeply that the cooperative had expanded from forty-odd households to more than two hundred households, from a natural village to all the natural villages in the township. They said that managing the affairs of these two hundred-plus households, such a large undertaking, by relying on the past leadership methods of only using their mouths and legs was absolutely impossible. Although they now recognize 1,500 or 1,600 characters, they still have difficulty writing, and they cannot recognize someone else's cursive handwriting. At the same time, it is urgently necessary to carry out political and ideological education among the broad masses of cooperative members to gradually improve their cultural level in order to consolidate and improve the work of the cooperative, improve technology, and increase production. In this way, the people's school work has become an indispensable task for production development.

However, the busy cooperative affairs and intense production work brought about by the expansion of the cooperative have created many conflicts in the arrangement of people's school work and production work. The need for culture - this is one aspect; but also squeezing out culture - this is another aspect; this is the problem that currently exists between rural production work and cultural work. It often happens that the cooperative holds a cadre meeting, and the winter school also beats the gong to start classes, resulting in people not attending both, and complaining to each other. As a result, the phenomenon of students missing classes is very serious, especially the cadres missing more classes. According to statistics from December last year: Among the thirty students in the cultural class, nine were cadres in the cooperative and five were labor team leaders. Due to meeting relationships, three people were absent from thirteen classes in one month, five people were absent from nine classes, four people were absent from five classes, and two people were absent from three classes. As mentioned above, Fang Jusheng wanted so much to learn culture well, but he only attended five classes in two months. In addition, some old problems that have been left over for many years, such as the problem of work exchange for spare-time teachers and the problem of people's school funding, have not been resolved. If these contradictions are not resolved, the winter school work cannot develop, and it will also affect the development of production work.

After the Spring Festival this year, the Xigou Village Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative pioneered the work of the cooperative running the people's school, achieved good experience and results, and smoothly resolved the above contradictions. In summary, there are several benefits to agricultural production cooperatives running people's schools:

	First, after the people's school work is unified under the leadership of the cooperative, the organization and leadership are strengthened, and the students' enthusiasm for learning is increased. This year, the overall plan of the cooperative also formulated a plan for the people's school work and put forward various requirements. Although these requirements are not specific enough, they have already made a start. The cooperative's plan stipulates that all the main cadres of the cooperative must do "two managements," that is, manage production and manage learning. The cultural and educational section should also hold a meeting once a month to regularly check the implementation of the people's school work plan, and at the monthly meeting of cooperative member groups to check production work, they should also check learning. Li Shunda, no matter which group he leads production in, must also check learning at the same time, and he himself insists on studying every day. The women's labor group led by Shen Jilan is even more active in both production and learning than before. They also ask and answer questions to each other while working. Five women in their group have become "double models" of production and learning. Xigou Village is originally two villages, about four or five miles apart from each other. When it is busy farming season, the students in the valley cannot come to the people's school to study. In the past, study groups were also organized in the valley in name, saying that they were studying separately, but in reality, they fell into a state of anarchy because no one was responsible. Now the cultural and educational section entrusts two labor groups in the valley to manage production and learning, and with the continuous inspection of spare-time teachers, the fifteen students in the valley have persisted in learning.

	Second, the contradiction between production and learning time is fundamentally resolved. Because the cooperative runs its own people's school, it is possible to arrange the time for learning, production, and various meetings in a unified manner according to the overall plan. For example, the old Xigou cooperative's time arrangement for April of this year (lunar calendar) is as follows: the cooperative affairs committee meets every tenth day, the cooperative member representative meeting or agricultural technology research meeting meets every fifth day (in addition to the meeting, there are also cultural classes), and political education is carried out within the cooperative every second and eighth day. In addition, four flexible meeting times are reserved. If there is no meeting, the cooperative members are organized to listen to the radio, and the remaining time is for cultural learning time. Without special circumstances, the system is guaranteed not to be disrupted. When the cooperative affairs committee and the cooperative member representative meeting are held, the remaining cooperative members still attend cultural classes, and a system of taking and making up classes is implemented for those who are absent. In this way, it is possible to ensure that cadres have a certain amount of time to learn culture and to meet the cooperative members' demand for learning culture.

	Third, the learning content can be closely combined with production and central work, and teaching can also be closely linked to the cooperative members' thoughts. For example, in terms of political classes, this year, in the work of subscribing to national construction bonds, ordering grain pre-purchase contracts, and calling on cooperative members to raise pigs, the people's school can cooperate in a timely manner, playing a role in educating the masses and raising the political and ideological awareness of cooperative members, and also helping to complete the work tasks; in terms of cultural classes, in order to meet the cooperative members' requirements and production needs, courses such as arithmetic, technology, and writing teaching have been added. The cooperative hires elementary school teachers to teach arithmetic classes, and hires county and district resident cadres to teach agricultural production technology classes. When sowing autumn crops, a lesson on "poison valley" was taught. After class, the students followed what they had learned and started working in the fields, applying 340 jin of poison valley to 215 mu of autumn land. As a result, the seedlings emerged very well, and no missing seedlings or broken ridges were found. For this reason, Li Shunda also cited this fact as an example of the combination of production and learning at the autumn sowing summary meeting. In order to help improve the teaching ability of spare-time teachers, the cooperative helped the elementary school teachers and volunteer teachers jointly organize a lesson preparation group without affecting the elementary school work. The elementary school teachers helped the spare-time teachers prepare a one-hour lesson every first and fifth day of the month and solve difficult problems in teaching. In the past, there was no one in charge of the political classes in the people's school. Now, before each class, the content of the lecture must be studied by the cooperative affairs cadres, and a specialist is hired to give the lecture. Through these practical works, the cadres have also made it clearer that strengthening political education in the people's school is an effective method to raise the ideological awareness of cooperative members and promote production.

	Fourth, some specific problems that have not been solved in the people's school for many years have been solved. The exchange of work for spare-time teachers is a problem that has not been solved in the Xigou people's school for twelve years. Now, the cooperative gives volunteer teachers 40 labor days (paid from the public welfare fund) every year to compensate for the spare-time teachers' missed work. Calculated according to the 1953 profit distribution standard, 40 labor days are equivalent to about 300 jin of coarse grains. The people's school funding has also been a place where there has been no proper expenditure for many years. Now, like other cooperative affairs expenses, it is solved uniformly from the public welfare fund. The students light their own lamps and each person uses two taels of oil per month. The cooperative subsidizes the shortfall.

After the Xigou Village People's School was run by the cooperative, it appeared even more vibrant. Now (during the busy farming season), there is one consolidated class in the village outside the valley, and two study groups in the valley. Li Shunda and others are too busy with work to participate in the people's school, so they organized self-study. Every morning, when the sun is still behind the Cypress Mountain in the east of the village, the cooperative members have already gone to the fields in groups, singing songs. Li Shunda also takes his literacy textbook and several resident cadres to the foot of Cypress Mountain to study - this is his most precious time. He is afraid of being disturbed by temporary sporadic things, so he hides outside the village. In the fields, during the rest time, the cooperative members gather in study groups and take out the books and newspapers they carry with them from their "mobile library bags." Then, the sound of reading newspapers replaces the singing. In the evening, the crescent moon hangs on the top of Cypress Mountain, and all the young men and women in the village gather in the wheat field, singing and dancing. After a while, they gather at the people's school for classes. Zhang Xiaoke, the spare-time teacher of the people's school, has been doing this work for six years. He was originally a warm-hearted and good teacher, and now he is even more energetic. He limps on one leg and comes back from production in the fields in the afternoon. He is either in the people's school or in the elementary school, or he goes to the back valley to check the study groups. This people's school was selected as an A-level model people's school in the Changzhi Special Zone of Shanxi Province this year. (Attached image)

    西沟村农林畜牧生产合作社办的民校
    山西省人民政府扫除文盲委员会
    山西省平顺县西沟村在一九四二年就开办了冬学，一九五二年转为常年民校，到现在已有十二年的历史。由于始终坚持着为生产服务的方针，西沟村的冬学和民校由小到大，逐步巩固和发展。今年，在全村合作化的基础上，由生产合作社办民校，使农民业余教育工作和生产工作更进一步结合起来；从此，西沟村的民校走上了一个新的阶段。
    西沟村共有五十三户人家，二百三十七口人。在旧社会里，它是个极贫穷的地方，好年景人民才能过上个“糠菜半年粮”的生活。全村只有三个人上过小学，其中最好的也不过认识千把个字。解放以后，西沟村人民在共产党领导下实行了减租减息和土地改革，又在全国农业劳动模范李顺达带动下，自一九四三年起便组织了互助组，开始走上互助合作的道路。一九五一年互助组发展为农林畜牧生产合作社。随着生产的发展，穷沟变成了富沟，人民生活大大改善了。一九五三年社内分红结果，社员收入一般都超过一九五二年（只有三户因为特殊困难未超过），其中一半以上的户数都超过百分之三十到百分之二百。
    西沟村的农民业余教育工作，随着经济的恢复和发展，也逐步地发展起来。一九四二年，西沟村进行减租减息工作，为了要向农民进行政治思想教育，便成立了冬学。在以后几年里，冬学在支援前线，土地改革等各项中心工作中都起了积极教育农民、提高农民群众阶级觉悟的作用。一九五一年，农林畜牧生产合作社建立起来了。由于实行了土地入股、计划生产、集体劳动的结果，出现了好多需要文化的新问题，譬如小组的记工，保管员的记账，技术员的学技术等，因而群众学文化的要求便提高了。因此，在次年开展扫盲工作的基础上，便把冬学转为常年民校。一九五三年冬天，全村已基本上扫除了青年中的文盲，壮年中的非文盲也占到了百分之二十三。全社七个主要干部（社长、副社长、股长）有六个由文盲变成了非文盲。全村有三十来个人能阅读“华北人民”和“山西农民”报，能写条据，能记工账。
    一九五三年冬天，经过宣传国家在过渡时期的总任务，群众觉悟程度更加提高，李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社由原来的四十七户社员发展到二百零三户。生产合作社扩大和生产发展的新情况带来了新的问题：即人们对于文化学习的要求大大增长了。社员群众，特别是青年们，都普遍感到，不仅目前办好农业生产合作社需要提高文化，而且，为了实现农业机械化的理想，更是需要进一步提高文化。而干部们，则更加深刻地感到了这一点。例如林业股长方具生，由于自己的文化水平低，对培育幼苗，防治病虫害和其他自然灾害，以及在多少平方亩内应植多少株树等技术问题，都掌握不了。上级虽然发下来一些讲解这方面技术的通俗书籍，但他刚刚识得一千来字，许多地方还看不懂。他说：“全社培植林业方面的担子全在咱身上，不好好学习可不行呀。”耕作大队长张小扁，现在虽说已能认得一千七八百单字（原来只识五十字），但写字很困难，又不会算术，而社里实行包工包产制，将土地按定工、定员、定时、定量分包给劳动小组，这个工作很复杂，要计算土地、产量、人工、肥料等，各种表格如“投入生产资料表”、“施肥表”、“记工表”也很多，这个工作作不好，就影响全队的生产，他也感到很吃力，感到不学习便要被工作抛在后面。负责全面工作的如李顺达、申纪兰等，更感到四十来户的社一下扩充到二百多户，由一个自然村发展到全乡各自然村，这二百多户的家务，这么大的摊子，再靠过去那种光凭嘴和腿的领导方法是绝对不行了。他们现在虽也认识一千五六百字，但拿笔还很困难，别人写的字潦草点便认不得了。同时对广大社员急需大力进行政治思想教育，逐步提高他们的文化水平，以巩固和提高社的工作，改进技术、提高产量。这样民校工作便成了生产发展的一项不可缺少的工作。
    但是，由社的扩大所带来的繁忙的社务和紧张的生产工作，却使民校工作和生产工作之间在安排上发生了许多矛盾。需要文化——这是一个方面；但又挤掉文化——这又是一个方面；这便是当前农村生产工作和文化工作之间存在的问题。常常有这样的情况：社里召开什么干部会议，正好冬学也打锣上课，结果闹的两面人都没到齐，互相抱怨。这样学员缺课现象就很严重，尤其是干部缺课更多。据去年十二月份统计：文化班三十个学员中在社内任干部的九人，劳动小组长五人，他们因开会关系，
  一月内缺课十三次的三人，缺课九次的五人，缺课五次的四人，缺课三次的两人。上面说过，方具生多么想学好文化，可是两个月内他只上了五次课。此外，还有一些多年遗留下来的老问题，如业余教师换工问题，民校经费问题等也得不到解决。这些矛盾不解决，冬学工作便不能发展，也会影响到生产工作的发展。
    今年春节以后，西沟村农林畜牧生产合作社创始了合作社办民校的工作，取得了良好的经验和效果，顺利地解决了上述矛盾。概括说来，农业生产合作社办民校有下面几点好处：
      一、民校工作统一归社领导以后，组织领导加强了，学员们的学习劲头提高了。今年，在社的全面计划中对民校工作也制订了计划和提出了各项要求。这些要求虽还不够具体，但已有了开端。社的计划中规定，所有社的主要干部都要做到“两管”，即管生产也管学习。文教股并要每月开会一次，定期检查民校工作计划执行情况，在每月社员小组检查生产工作的会议上，也要检查学习情况。李顺达不论到那一组领导生产，同时也要检查学习，他自己也每天坚持学习。申纪兰领导的妇女劳动小组，不论生产和学习较前更为积极，她们在作活中还互相问答问题。她们小组里有五个妇女当上了生产和学习的“双模范”。西沟村本是两个庄子，相互距离有四五里远，到农忙的时候，沟内学员便无法到民校来学习，过去沟内在名义上也组织了学习小组，说是分散学习，实际上因为无人负责而陷入自流状态了。现在文教股委托沟内两个劳动小组管生产也管学习，再加上业余教师的不断检查，使沟内的十五个学员坚持了学习。
    二、根本上解决了生产和学习时间的矛盾。因为合作社自己办民校，就有可能根据全面计划，按季节统一安排学习、生产和各种会议的时间。例如，西沟老社，在今年阴历四月的时间安排是这样：逢十开社务委员会议，逢五开社员代表会或农业技术研究会（除开会外还要上文化课），逢二逢八进行社内政治教育。另外留四次机动会议时间，如不开会就组织社员收听广播，其余为文化学习时间，没有特别事情，保证不打乱制度。在开社务委员会、社员代表会时，其余社员仍上文化课，缺课的实行领课、补课制度。这样每月可上二十次文化课，黑夜全班在一块学习一小时半。这样，既保证了干部有一定的学习文化的时间，又满足了社员学文化的要求。
    三、学习内容可以密切结合生产和中心工作，教学中也可以密切联系社员思想。例如，政治课方面，今年在认购建设公债、订粮食预购合同以及号召社员们养猪等工作中，民校均能及时配合、起到教育群众、提高社员政治思想的作用，同时也帮助完成了工作任务；在文化课方面，为了满足社员们的要求和生产的需要，增加了算术、技术和写作教学等课目，由社里聘请小学教师代教算术课，聘请县区住村干部讲农业生产技术课。当种秋禾的时候上了一课“毒谷”，学员们下了课按照讲的在地里便作开了，在二百一十五亩秋地中上了三百四十斤毒谷，结果出苗很好，没有发现缺苗断垅现象。为此李顺达在总结秋种的大会上还把这一事实列举为生产和学习结合的范例。合作社为了帮助提高业余教师的教学能力，在不影响小学工作的情况下，帮助小学教师和义务教师共同组织了一个备课小组，每月逢一逢五日由小学教师帮助业余教师备一个钟头的课，和解决教学中的疑难问题。过去民校中的政治课没专人负责，现在每逢上课都要经社务干部研究讲课内容，聘请专人来讲。通过这些实际工作，也使干部们更加明确了加强民校中的政治教育，是提高社员思想觉悟、推动生产的一个有效方法。
    四、民校中多年未解决的一些具体问题解决了。业余教师换工是西沟民校十二年来没有解决了的问题，现在每年由社内给义务教员顶四十个劳动日（由公益金内开支），补偿余业教师的误工。若按一九五三年分红标准计算，四十个劳动日约合三百余斤粗粮。民校经费也是多年没个正经开支的地方，现在和其他社务费用一样，由公益金内统一解决，学员自己点灯每月每人二两油，不足部分由社补助。
    西沟村民校由合作社办以后，更显得生气勃勃了。现在（农忙阶段）沟外庄子上是一个巩固班，沟内是两个学习小组，李顺达等四人因为工作太忙顾不上参加民校，便组织了自学。每天早晨，太阳还在村东的柏山后面，社员们已经成群打伙唱着歌子下地了，李顺达也拿着他的识字课本和几个住村干部到柏山脚下去学习——这是他最宝贵的时间，他怕被临时的零星事情扰乱，所以才躲到村外去的。在地里，一到休息时间，社员们按学习小组集合起来，从他们的“流动图书包”里拿出随身带着的书报来，于是读报的声音代替了歌声。晚上，月牙儿挂在柏山顶上，全村青年男女都聚集在麦场里，又是歌唱又是跳舞，不大一阵他们又集合到民校上课了。星期六晚上，大家将自己社里的收音机搬出来集体听广播，或者放映自己的幻灯，青年们在民校的领导下不断向社员们演出自己排练的剧目。民校业余教师张小科，担任这一工作已有六年，他本来就是一个热心的好教师，现在更是劲头十足。他瘸着一条腿，下午从地里生产回来，不是在民校里，就是在小学里，要不然便走到后沟去检查学习小组。这个民校今年被选为山西省长治专区甲等模范民校。（附图片）
