(Xinhua News Agency, August 24th) A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement regarding the U.S. government's attempt to terminate the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) in Korea, as follows:

    On August 3, 1954, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated that the United States favored ending the NNSC in Korea and that this issue might be discussed at the United Nations General Assembly this fall. We believe that Dulles's remarks are clearly an attempt to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement and shake its foundations. Such remarks will have extremely serious implications for the Korean armistice. The U.S. government cannot shirk its responsibility for this.

    At a time when the Syngman Rhee government of South Korea is taking various violent actions to threaten and insult the NNSC inspection teams in South Korea and attempting to murder Polish and Czechoslovak personnel on the teams, Dulles not only does not express any opposition to the Syngman Rhee government's violent actions but instead issues such destructive remarks to support them. This cannot but lead people to suspect that the U.S. government is the instigator of the Syngman Rhee government's violent actions.

    For a long time, the United Nations Command side has violated the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement by illegally transporting many reinforcing military supplies into South Korea. This is a well-known fact. The Polish and Czechoslovak members of the NNSC have impartially reported on these facts, in accordance with the Armistice Agreement; this is entirely their duty, and no one is allowed to criticize them. However, the United Nations Command side has deliberately plotted to abolish the NNSC because of this. On April 15, 1954, General Lacey, the Senior Member of the United Nations Command side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, sent a letter to the NNSC, repeatedly insulting and slandering the commission and asserting that the commission would no longer be able to play any role in the future. On the same day, the United Nations Command side unilaterally announced so-called new methods for inspection work in South Korea, forcing the NNSC inspection teams to implement them, rendering the commission's inspection work in South Korea virtually useless. Recently, South Korean government officials have repeatedly stated that they want to expel the NNSC. The U.S. government has never opposed this. It is clear that Dulles's remarks are an open manifestation of the U.S. government's consistent conspiracy over the past few months. Its purpose is to abolish the NNSC so that the U.S. government can freely transport large quantities of reinforcing military supplies into South Korea, expand the Syngman Rhee government's army, increase the instability of the Korean armistice, and intensify international tensions. The fact that Dulles's remarks were made after the U.S. government and Syngman Rhee's talks on expanding the South Korean army is enough to illustrate this purpose of the U.S. government.

    In order to cover up this purpose of the U.S. government, Dulles also attempted to slander the Korean-Chinese side for transporting military supplies into Korea through other ports. However, according to the reports of the NNSC inspection teams at the ports of North Korea after the Korean armistice, it can be proved that the entry and exit of materials and personnel on the Korean-Chinese side comply with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement.

    Throughout the Korean armistice period, the NNSC has undertaken the important task of supervising the implementation of the Armistice Agreement. Although the commission has been subjected to all kinds of obstruction by the United Nations Command side, it has still done a lot of positive work, which has been helpful for the implementation of the Armistice Agreement. The U.S. government not only does not acknowledge this patience and great effort, which the commission has long demonstrated in favor of peace in the Far East, but also arbitrarily slanders the Polish and Czechoslovak personnel of the commission. This unreasonable behavior of the U.S. government will inevitably make the work of the commission in South Korea more difficult and make the safety of the commission's personnel in South Korea more threatened. The U.S. government should bear full responsibility for the consequences that may arise from such arbitrary slander.

    The establishment of the NNSC is an inseparable part of the Korean Armistice Agreement. It is the result of an agreement between the two parties to the Korean armistice and cannot be unilaterally terminated or abolished by either party. The United Nations is one of the two parties to the Korean armistice, and it has no right to unilaterally handle this issue.

    We fully support the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world will never allow the U.S. government's conspiracy to undermine the Korean NNSC and the Korean Armistice Agreement to succeed. Now, the Geneva Conference has reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, thereby further easing tensions in Asia and the world. Moreover, the Geneva Conference's principled agreement on resolving the political issues of Indochina also brings new hope for the peaceful reunification of Korea. We believe that in order to continue to ease international tensions and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it is necessary to stabilize the Korean armistice. The Korean Armistice Agreement must not be divided or undermined, and the Korean NNSC should continue. The United Nations Command side must fulfill its own promises and take effective measures as soon as possible to ensure the safety of the members of the NNSC and the normal working conditions of the NNSC inspection teams. The NNSC has the responsibility, in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, to uphold its legitimate status and rights and to oppose all attempts to obstruct and undermine the work of the NNSC. The Korean-Chinese side will, in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, firmly support all efforts of the NNSC in this regard.

    就美国政府企图结束在朝鲜的中立国监察委员会事
    我外交部发言人发表谈话
    我方根据停战协定坚决支持委员会的努力
    【新华社二十四日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部发言人就美国政府企图结束在朝鲜的中立国监察委员会事，发表谈话如下：
    一九五四年八月三日美国国务卿杜勒斯表示，美国赞成结束在朝鲜的中立国监察委员会，并称这个问题可能要在今年秋天的联合国大会上讨论。我们认为杜勒斯的这种谈话显然是企图破坏朝鲜停战协定，使停战协定的基础遭受动摇。这种谈话对于朝鲜停战将产生极其严重的影响。美国政府对此不能不负起它应负的责任。
    正当南朝鲜李承晚政府采取各种暴力行动来威胁和侮辱在南朝鲜的中立国监察委员会视察小组、并企图谋杀小组中的波兰人员和捷克斯洛伐克人员的时候，杜勒斯对李承晚政府的暴力行为不但丝毫不表示反对，反而发表这种破坏性的谈话来加以支持，这不能不使人怀疑美国政府就是李承晚政府暴力行动的指使者。
    长期以来，联合国军方面违反朝鲜停战协定的规定，将许多增援性的军事物资非法运入南朝鲜。这是人所共知的事实。中立国监察委员会的波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员根据停战协定，对这种事实公正地提出报告；这完全是他们的职责，不容许任何人加以非难。但是，联合国军方面竟因此蓄意图谋取消中立国监察委员会。一九五四年四月十五日，朝鲜军事停战委员会联合国军方面首席委员拉西将军致函中立国监察委员会，对该委员会百般侮辱和诬蔑，并断言该委员会今后将不能发生任何作用。在同一天，联合国军方面又片面地宣布关于在南朝鲜的监察工作的所谓新办法，强使中立国视察小组加以执行，使该委员会在南朝鲜的视察工作等于虚设。最近以来，南朝鲜政府负责人员曾多次声称要驱逐中立国监察委员会。美国政府对此从未加以反对。由此可见，杜勒斯的谈话正是美国政府几个月来的一贯阴谋的公开表现。它的目的是为了取消中立国监察委员会，以便美国政府放手将增援性的军事物资大量运入南朝鲜，扩充李承晚政府的军队，增加朝鲜停战的不稳定状态来加强国际的紧张局势。杜勒斯的谈话正在美国政府和李承晚关于扩充南朝鲜军队的会谈之后发表，就足以说明美国政府的这一目的。
    为了掩盖美国政府的这个目的，杜勒斯又企图诬蔑朝中方面通过其他口岸把军事物资运入朝鲜。但是，根据朝鲜停战后北朝鲜各口岸中立国视察小组的报告，可以证明，朝中方面关于物资和人员的进出是符合于停战协定的规定的。
    在整个朝鲜停战时期中，中立国监察委员会担当了监督停战协定的实施的重大任务。该委员会虽然受到了联合国军方面的百般阻挠，但是仍做了很多积极的工作，这对于停战协定的实施是有帮助的。对于该委员会长期以来所表现的这种有利于远东和平的耐心和重大努力，美国政府不仅根本不予承认，反而任意诬蔑该委员会的波兰人员和捷克斯洛伐克人员。美国政府这种无理的表现，必然将使该委员会在南朝鲜的工作受到更大的困难，使该委员会在南朝鲜的工作人员的安全受到更大的威胁。对于由这种任意诬蔑而可能产生的后果，美国政府应负完全的责任。
    中立国监察委员会的设置，是朝鲜停战协定不可分割的一部分，它是朝鲜停战缔约双方协议的结果，不能由任何一方片面加以结束或废止。联合国是朝鲜停战缔约双方中的一方，它无权片面处理这个问题。
    我们完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人的谈话。中国人民及全世界爱好和平的人民绝不容许美国政府破坏朝鲜中立国监察委员会、破坏朝鲜停战协定的阴谋得逞。现在，日内瓦会议已经获致了恢复印度支那和平的协议，因而进一步地缓和了亚洲及世界的紧张局势。并且，日内瓦会议关于解决印度支那政治问题的原则协议，为朝鲜的和平统一问题的解决也带来了新的希望。我们认为，为了继续缓和国际紧张局势，为了争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，必须稳定朝鲜停战。朝鲜停战协定不容割裂和破坏，朝鲜中立国监察委员会应该继续下去。联合国军方面必须实现它自己的诺言，迅速采取有效措施，以保证中立国监察委员会成员的安全和中立国视察小组正常的工作条件。中立国监察委员会有责任根据停战协定的规定，坚持自己的合法的地位和权利，反对一切阻挠和破坏中立国监察委员会的工作的企图。朝中方面将根据停战协定坚决支持中立国监察委员会在这方面的一切努力。
