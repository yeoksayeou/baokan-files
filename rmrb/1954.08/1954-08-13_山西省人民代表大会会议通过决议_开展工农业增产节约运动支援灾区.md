    The first session of the Shanxi Provincial People's Congress passed a resolution on the 9th concerning striving to exceed the agricultural production increase target and to universally launch a production increase and thrift campaign. This resolution expresses sincere concern and sympathy to the peasant brothers in parts of Hubei, Hunan, Anhui and other provinces who have suffered from floods, and calls on the people of the province to immediately mobilize, carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, and widely launch a production increase and thrift campaign, striving to increase autumn grain production by another 200 to 300 million jin on the basis of the original planned increase of 500 million jin, and to increase seed cotton production by another 40 million jin on the basis of the original planned increase of 130 million jin; state-owned and local state-owned industrial and mining enterprises throughout the province must ensure that, on the basis of completing the 1954 state plan, the achievements of this year's production increase and thrift campaign are not lower than the total of 440 billion yuan achieved last year; thereby compensating for the loss of agricultural production in disaster areas and ensuring the completion of this year's national industrial and agricultural production plan.
    In order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, the resolution puts forward the following effective measures: Within the scope of the province's rural areas, quickly launch a warm production increase movement led by agricultural producers' cooperatives, driving mutual aid teams and the vast number of peasants to participate, continue to prevent and overcome various natural disasters, strengthen field technical guidance, increase topdressing, eliminate weeds, remove diseased plants, and universally achieve timely harvesting, careful harvesting and threshing, strive to bring every grain home, and ensure a bumper harvest. All localities should also make use of the spring wheat stubble land and small plots of open space to plant more autumn vegetables, increase income, and take advantage of the favorable opportunity that this year's frost season is ten days to half a month later than in previous years, and strive to reduce the losses caused by disasters to the minimum. In terms of industrial production, it is required to rely on all employees, continue to implement the policy of combining production increase and thrift labor competition with improving enterprise management, strengthen planning management, carry out technological innovation movements, strengthen safety and health work, improve quality, reduce costs, and ensure the comprehensive, balanced and safe completion of this year's national plan and the task of increasing production and practicing thrift.
    When discussing and passing this resolution, all the delegates fully reflected their determination to fully support the peasant brothers in the disaster areas, and based on the current good growth of autumn seedlings and cotton in various places, analyzed the favorable conditions in all aspects, and believed that it was certain that the tasks stipulated in the resolution could be completed. Gou Peifang, secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Juzhai Township, Lu'an County, Wu Houli, a provincial forestry model worker, and Xu Shunhai, a militia model worker, all expressed that they would lead the agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations they belong to in hoeing the autumn crops again, doing a good job in flood prevention, mountain disaster prevention, frost prevention, careful harvesting and threshing, and ensuring that each mu would increase production by another six or seven jin of grain. Li Shunda, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model, said: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the 600 million people of the country are truly united like one person. Although we live in Shanxi Province and have not suffered from the floods of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, we must also use practical actions to support our brothers in the disaster areas and ensure the completion of the entire national plan."

    山西省人民代表大会会议通过决议
    开展工农业增产节约运动支援灾区
    山西省第一届人民代表大会会议在九日通过了一项关于全力争取超额完成农业增产任务并普遍开展增产节约运动的决议。这个决议中对湖北、湖南、安徽等省部分地区受到水灾的农民兄弟表示热诚的关怀和慰问，并号召全省人民立即动员起来，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，广泛开展增产节约运动，力争全省秋粮在原计划增产五亿斤的基础上再增产二亿到三亿斤，籽棉在原计划增产一亿三千万斤的基础上再增产四千万斤；全省国营、地方国营的工矿企业，要保证在完成一九五四年的国家计划的基础上，使今年增产节约的成绩不低于去年增产节约四千四百亿元的总数；从而弥补灾区农业减产的损失，并保证今年国家的工农业生产计划的完成。
    为实现上述奋斗目标，决议中提出了以下的有效措施：在全省农村范围内，迅速开展一个以农业生产合作社为前导带动互助组和广大农民参加的热烈的增产运动，继续防止和战胜各种自然灾害，加强田间技术指导，增施追肥，消灭杂草，拔除病株，并普遍作到适时收割，细收细打，争取颗粒还家，保证丰收。各地还应利用春麦茬地及小片空地多种秋菜，增加收入，并利用今年秋季降霜期比往年迟十天到半月的有利时机，争取使灾害所造成的损失减少到最小限度。工业生产方面要求依靠全体职工，继续贯彻增产节约劳动竞赛和改善企业管理相结合的方针，加强计划管理，开展技术革新运动，加强安全卫生工作，提高质量，降低成本，保证全面地、均衡地和安全地完成今年的国家计划和增产节约任务。
    全体到会代表在讨论和通过这一决议时，充分反映了全力支援灾区农民兄弟的决心，并根据目前各地秋苗、棉花生长的良好状况，分析了各方面的有利条件，认为完成决议中规定的任务是有把握的。中共潞安县琚寨乡总支书记苟佩芳、全省林业模范武侯梨、民兵模范徐顺孩等代表，纷纷表示要领导他们所在的农业互助合作组织把大秋作物再多锄一遍、做好防洪、防山害、防霜、细收细打等工作，保证每亩再增产六、七斤粮食。全国著名农业劳动模范李顺达说：“全国六亿人民在毛主席领导下，真正团结得像一个人。我们住在山西省虽然没有受到长江、淮河的水害，但也一定要用实际行动支援灾区兄弟，保证整个国家计划的完成。”
