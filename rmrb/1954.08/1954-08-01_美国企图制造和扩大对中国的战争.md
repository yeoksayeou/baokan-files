    The United States military aircraft intruded into our country's airspace, shot down two of our aircraft, and attacked our ships on the high seas. This series of aggressive atrocities committed by the United States government has aroused the indignation and opposition of world opinion and many political figures. In order to deceive the public and shirk responsibility, it shamelessly issued a so-called "protest" statement to the People's Republic of China on the 27th. In this statement, the United States government, on the one hand, frankly admitted the crime of shooting down two of our aircraft, but on the other hand, it made futile attempts to cover up and deny the facts that U.S. aircraft deliberately intruded into our country's airspace for frantic provocations and attacked Polish merchant ships and our escort ships on the high seas for no reason. The fact is that U.S. aircraft in batches intruded into the airspace over Yulin Port and Lehui over Hainan Island, and the twelve U.S. fighter planes that intruded into the airspace over Lehui frantically attacked our two patrol planes and shot down our planes, but they lied that U.S. planes were carrying out "rescue" work for a British plane that crashed about thirteen miles from Hainan Island in the open sea when they were attacked by our planes and then "retaliated"; it is clear that two U.S. fighter planes carried out piratical dive attacks on two Polish merchant ships and our escort ships sailing on the high seas, and only fled after our ships fired back in self-defense, but they did not dare to mention their piratical behavior at all, instead calling their piratical aircraft "performing benevolent missions" and blaming our aircraft for not firing at them.
    The United States' provocative actions have aroused the world's people's indignation and condemnation. Therefore, on the 28th, U.S. President Eisenhower also hurriedly came forward in person at a press conference to deny the crime of U.S. aircraft intruding into our country's airspace. When a reporter raised the question of the United States' allies expressing concern about the United States' actions to provoke war, Eisenhower weakly defended, saying that the fleet and aircraft dispatched by the United States to the waters near Hainan Island "had no intention of provoking any incident." This defense is unreasonable. World opinion asked Eisenhower that the British plane had encountered misfortune at sea for three days, and the Hong Kong government had already considered the search to be worthless and abandoned it more than forty-eight hours before the US plane attacked our plane. Then, the US plane was still ordered to "fire" here at any time. Isn't this deliberately looking for an opportunity to provoke trouble? Moreover, since it is said to be searching for British aircraft, why not at sea but deep into our Lehui territorial airspace? Since it is said to be searching for and rescuing British aircraft, why not use rescue aircraft, but attack aircraft of the "air raider" type for dive bombing? Isn't this a deliberate infringement, attempting to provoke war? Eisenhower need not make these pitiful defenses. Everyone knows that the United States ruling clique loves war, seeks war, and tries its best to create and expand the war of aggression against the People's Republic of China. This is the real fact, and this is the real reason why world opinion and political figures are worried and indignant.
    Eisenhower also stubbornly described the aggressive atrocities of U.S. aircraft intruding into our country's airspace and shooting down our aircraft as "self-defense measures" and "to protect the interests of the United States." He said, "American ships and aircraft have the right to stay where they are," and he also肆无忌惮said:
  "Wherever necessary, the American people
  (Note: In the mouths of the Eisenhowers, the so-called "American people" actually refers to a small group of warmongers in the United States) will defend their rights." May I ask, what exactly are the "interests" that a country dispatches its troops to a place more than 10,000 kilometers away across the ocean to "defend" in peacetime? What exactly are the "rights" to send its troops into other countries to defend? This is the "interest" and "right" of aggression, this is the "interest" and "right" of creating war. The Japanese militarist rule and Nazi fascism once advocated and "defended" this kind of sinful "interest" and "right." However, the people of the world did not allow them to have this "interest" and "right," so they buried them together with their "interest" and "right." Only the United States ruling clique wants to revive them and wants to learn from them. However, if the United States ruling clique thinks that today's people will be weaker and more paralyzed than the people in World War II, then they are greatly mistaken. If they think that the 600 million Chinese people will allow the United States army to learn from Japanese militarism and come to China to "defend" the "interests" and "rights" of the United States to carry out aggression, then they are even more mistaken. It should be pointed out that the United States government's protest statement to our country is an ignorant and shameful act. The Chinese people believe that the protest statement made by the United States based on their "interests" and "rights" of aggression is not worth a penny. If the United States ruling clique insists on its "interests" and "rights" to intrude into our country, then they will regret it sooner or later!
    It is precisely because U.S. imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan, instructed and supported the Chiang Kai-shek remnants to intensify their harassment of the Chinese coast, and dispatched its own naval and air forces to carry out harassment, making the Chinese coast an area increasingly filled with an atmosphere of war tension, that a British aircraft had an accidental misfortune. This incident has been reasonably resolved by China and Britain through normal diplomatic channels, but the United States warmongering clique has used it as an excuse to further expand its aggression against the People's Republic of China, and has used this to vigorously incite war hysteria, attempting to re-tension the international situation that has eased after the Geneva Conference. Their sinister activities have aroused great indignation from the people all over the world, making the people of the world see the true face of U.S. imperialism even more clearly. U.S. imperialism, under the guise of "for humanity" and "performing benevolent missions," is actually doing nothing but killing and plundering in other people's countries tens of thousands of kilometers away from the United States. The bloody records of the past robber behavior of the U.S. aggressors in China, Greece, Korea, Indochina, and not long ago in Guatemala, can never be erased. Any of their cover-ups and denials are in vain.

    美国企图制造和扩大对中国的战争
    新华社评论员　江南
    美国军用飞机侵入我国领空，击落我国飞机两架、并在公海上袭击我国船舰。美国政府进行的这一连串侵略暴行，引起了世界舆论和不少政界人士的愤慨和反对。它为了蒙混视听、推脱罪责，反而在二十七日无耻地对中华人民共和国发出了所谓“抗议”声明。美国政府在这个声明中，一方面对美机击落我机两架的罪行直认不讳，但另一方面却对美机蓄意侵入我国领空进行疯狂挑衅，并在公海上无端袭击波兰商船与我国护航舰的事实，进行徒劳的掩饰和抵赖。事实明明是美机成批侵入我国海南岛榆林港上空和乐会上空，侵入乐会上空的十二架美国战斗机向我国两架巡逻机进行疯狂攻击，并击落了我机，而他们却撒谎说是美机在离海南岛十三英里左右处的公海上空进行“救援”英国失事飞机的工作时，遭受我机攻击才进行“还击”的；明明是两架美国战斗机向在公海上航行的两艘波兰商船及我国护航舰进行海盗式的俯冲攻击，经我舰自卫还击后才逃去，他们却根本不敢提到他们这种海盗行为，反而把他们的海盗飞机说成是什么“正在执行仁慈任务”，怪我机不应该向它们开火。
    美国的挑衅行动引起了世界人民的愤慨指责，因此，美国总统艾森豪威尔在二十八日也慌忙亲自出面，在记者招待会上抵赖美机侵入我国领空的罪行。当记者提到美国的盟国对美国挑拨战争的行动表示忧虑的问题时，艾森豪威尔软弱无力地辩解说：美国派遣到海南岛附近海面的舰队和飞机“并无挑起任何事件的意图”。这种辩解毫无道理。世界舆论问艾森豪威尔，英机在海上遭遇不幸已经三天，香港政府在美机攻击我机之前四十八个多小时，已认为搜索是无价值的事而加以放弃，那么，美机还奉命在这里随时“开火”，这不是故意寻找机会挑衅生事是什么？而且，既然说是搜寻英国飞机，为什么不在海上而深入到我国乐会领空？既然说是搜寻和救援英机，为什么不用救援飞机，而用进行俯冲轰炸的、“空中袭击者”式的攻击机？这不是蓄意侵犯，企图挑起战争又是什么？艾森豪威尔很用不着做这些可怜的辩解。人人都知道，美国统治集团渴爱战争，寻找战争，竭力想制造和扩大对中华人民共和国的侵略战争这就是真正的事实，这也就是世界舆论和政界人士所以忧虑和愤慨的真正原因。
    艾森豪威尔又硬把美国飞机侵入我国领空击落我机的侵略暴行说成是“自卫措施”，说成“是为了保卫美国的利益”。他说，“美国舰只和飞机有权留在他们所在的地方”，他并且肆无忌惮地说：
  “不管在什么地方，只要有必要的话，美国人民
  （按：在艾森豪威尔们的嘴里，所谓“美国人民”实际上是指美国一小撮好战分子）将保卫他们的权利。”试问，一个国家在平时派遣它的军队到远隔海洋一万多公里之外的地方去“保卫”的“利益”，究竟是什么利益？派它的军队侵入其他国家去保卫的“权利”，究竟是什么权利？这就是侵略的“利益”和“权利”，这就是制造战争的“利益”和“权利”。日本军国主义统治和纳粹法西斯都曾经主张过而且也“保卫”过这种罪恶的“利益”和“权利”。可是，世界人民却不容许他们有这种“利益”和“权利”，因此，就把他们连同他们的这种“利益”和“权利”都埋葬了，只有美国统治集团才想把他们复活起来，而且想学他们的样。但是，如果美国统治集团以为今天的人民会比第二次世界大战中的人民更软弱、更麻痹，那他们就大错而特错了。如果他们以为六万万中国人民会容许美国军队学日本军国主义的样，到中国领域里来“保卫”美国进行侵略的“利益”和“权利”，那他们就更加是大错而特错了。应该指出，美国政府对我国提出什么抗议声明，是无知的、可耻的行动。对美国根据他们进行侵略的“利益”和“权利”而提出的什么抗议声明，中国人民认为不值一钱。如果美国统治集团硬要坚持它的侵入我国的“利益”和“权利”，那么，他们迟早是会后悔的！
    正是由于美帝国主义侵占了我国领土台湾、指使和支持蒋介石残匪加紧对中国沿海进行骚扰，并出动美国自己的海空军进行骚扰，使中国沿海日益变成布满战争紧张气氛的地区，才使一架英国飞机发生了意外不幸事件。这个事件已由中英两国经由正常外交途径进行合理解决，而美国好战集团却用来作为进一步扩大对中华人民共和国进行侵略的借口，并且借此大肆煽动战争歇斯底里，企图使在日内瓦会议之后已趋于缓和的国际局势重新趋于紧张。他们的这种罪恶的活动已经引起了全世界人民的极大愤慨，使世界人民更加看清了美帝国主义者的真正面目。美帝国主义打着“为了人道”、“执行仁慈任务”等等的幌子，而实际上干的却是到远离美国上万公里以外的别人的国土上杀人越货、无恶不作。美国侵略者过去在中国、在希腊、在朝鲜、在印度支那以及不久之前在危地马拉的强盗行为的血腥纪录，都是永远抹不掉的。他们的任何掩饰和抵赖都是徒劳的。
