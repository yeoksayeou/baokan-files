    Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: Syngman Rhee once again frantically clamored for a “northward advance” on August 15th. He said that he already had some kind of plan to "advance to the Yalu River and drive the Communists out of Korea." He said that South Korea was "ready to take final action." He demanded that the "United Nations" "cooperate" with him, otherwise, he would "allow Korean troops to take their own separate action."

    Syngman Rhee does not hide the fact that his warmongering clamor stems from instigation by the United States. He described his plan as "a plan that American strategists would agree with." United Press International stated even more clearly: "He implied that the plan has been approved by the United States." In fact, Syngman Rhee's attitude is a result of his recent talks with the United States in Washington. Regarding this, the American International News Service said:
  "Well-informed sources in Seoul had already predicted that Syngman Rhee's attitude would become increasingly tough upon his return from the United States last week."

    The above situation shows that the reason for Syngman Rhee's sudden re-issuance of frenzied clamoring should be sought from the United States. In order to organize the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and undermine Asian peace, the United States is making one threat after another to the unstable Korean armistice. Therefore, although many American propaganda organs emphasize that Syngman Rhee will take "separate" action, it is precisely his American master who is manipulating Syngman Rhee who should be responsible for any adventurous plans of Syngman Rhee.

    美国唆使李承晚叫嚣战争
    【新华社十七日讯】李承晚在八月十五日又疯狂地叫嚣“北进”。他说，他已有某种计划，要
  “推进到鸭绿江，把共产党赶出朝鲜”。他说，南朝鲜“已经准备好采取最后行动”。他要求“联合国”和他“合作”，否则，就“允许韩国部队采取他们自己的单独行动”。
    李承晚并不隐讳他的好战叫嚣是出于美国方面的唆使。他把他的计划说成是“一项将会得到美国战略家同意的计划”。合众社更明白地说：“他暗示，这个计划已得到美国的同意。”事实上，李承晚的这种态度正是他最近到华盛顿与美国方面进行会谈的结果。关于这一点，美国的国际新闻社就说：
  “汉城消息灵通人士前已预料到李承晚上周从美国回来的态度将会日趋强硬。”
    上面所说的情况表明，李承晚突然再次发出疯狂叫嚣的原因应该从美国方面去找，美国为了要筹组东南亚侵略集团，破坏亚洲和平，正在对不稳定的朝鲜停战作出一次又一次的威胁。因此，尽管许多美国宣传机关强调李承晚要采取“单独”行动的说法，但是应该对李承晚的任何冒险打算负责任的却正是操纵着李承晚的他的美国主子。
