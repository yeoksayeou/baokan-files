    Tangshan Angezhuang Agricultural Cooperative
    Massively Raises Hogs to Supply City Needs
    The Angezhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the 10th District of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, is massively raising hogs to supply the needs of the city. Starting in January of this year, the Angezhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative has been publicly raising 108 hogs. They are divided into three farms and six pens, and are cared for by three experienced elderly cooperative members. In order to solve the feed problem, contracts were signed with the district supply and marketing cooperative, porcelain kilns, cement factories, and steel plants to grind sesame oil, grind flour dough, and boil sugar malt, using the remaining sweet water and residue to feed the pigs. The pigs in the cooperative grow very quickly on this type of feed, which has led private and individual households to increase the number of pigs they raise by more than 150 within three months. In order to prevent and control hog cholera, the cooperative has also prepared penicillin and other medicines. In the past six months, not a single publicly owned pig in the cooperative has died, and more than 40 sick pigs have been treated for cooperative members and individual households. As of the beginning of July, the cooperative has sold 56 fattened pigs to the supply and marketing cooperative according to the contract, the largest of which weighed 319 catties, and the average weight was over 250 catties. They are planning to use the money from selling the pigs to expand production and buy some new agricultural tools. (Gao Liang)

    唐山市安各庄农业合作社
    大量喂养毛猪供应城市需要
    河北省唐山市第十区安各庄农业生产合作社，大量喂养毛猪，供应城市需要。从今年一月份起安各庄农业生产合作社公共养毛猪一百零八口。分三场六圈，由三个年老有经验的社员负责饲养。为了解决饲料问题，和区供销社、瓷窑、水泥厂和钢厂等单位订立了磨香油、磨粉团、和熬糖饴合同，把加工剩下的甘水和糟用来喂猪。社里的猪吃这种饲料长得非常快，因此带动了社员私人和单干户们在三个月内也增养了一百五十多口猪。为了防治猪瘟，社里还准备了盘尼西林等药品，半年来全社的公有猪没有一个死亡，并为社员和单干户医好了病猪四十多口。七月初该社已按合同卖给供销社肥猪五十六口，其中最大的有三百一十九斤重，一般的也在二百五十斤以上。他们正计划把卖猪的钱用来扩大生产，和买一部分新式农具。　（高粮）
