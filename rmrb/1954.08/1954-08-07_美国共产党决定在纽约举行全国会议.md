Xinhua News Agency, New York, 6th: According to a report in the New York "Daily Worker," the American Communist Party will hold a national conference in New York from August 7th to 8th to discuss the American Communist Party's policy issues in the 1954 congressional elections. More than 150 representatives from 20 states will participate in the conference. The conference will be inaugurated by a mass rally held on August 6th.

    Based on the new draft program of the American Communist Party, this conference will discuss the situation of this year's congressional elections and the issue of nominating candidates by the Communist Party in some regions. The conference will also state its attitude towards the candidates and campaign platforms of other political parties.

    Pettis Perry, chairman of the American Communist Party's National Election Committee, who announced the holding of the conference, pointed out that the main points of discussion at the conference are the following parts of the draft program: "The 1954 election is crucial in deciding the path the United States will take. McCarthy has challenged the American people. What is needed is to unite every decent and loyal force among our people and to unite all independent-minded voters—whether Democrat, Republican, or Progressive. This unity itself must be established on the goal of defeating all kinds of McCarthy-McCarran-Southern Democratic candidates, defeating every pro-fascist element and mad war-monger, and electing an anti-McCarthy Congress."

    美国共产党决定在纽约举行全国会议
    【新华社六日讯】纽约消息：据纽约“工人日报”报道，美国共产党在八月七日至八日在纽约举行全国会议，讨论美国共产党在一九五四年国会选举中的政策问题。参加这次会议的将有来自二十个州的一百五十多名代表。会议将由八月六日举行的一次群众集会予以揭幕。
    这次会议将在美国共产党新的纲领草案的基础上，讨论今年国会选举的形势和若干地区共产党提名候选人的问题。大会并将表明对其他政党的候选人和竞选纲领的态度。
    宣布将举行这次会议的美国共产党全国竞选委员会主席佩蒂斯·佩里指出：会议讨论的要点是纲领草案中的下述一部分：“一九五四年的选举就决定美国将要走的道路说来，是具有关键性的。麦卡锡已经向美国人民挑战。所需要做的是，团结我国人民中每一份正派的、忠诚的力量和团结一切——不论是民主党、共和党或进步党——有独立意志的选举人。这种团结本身必须确立在这样一个目标上，即击败各式各样的麦卡锡—麦卡伦—南方民主党的候选人，击败每一个亲法西斯分子和疯狂的战争贩子，而选举出一个反麦卡锡的国会。”
