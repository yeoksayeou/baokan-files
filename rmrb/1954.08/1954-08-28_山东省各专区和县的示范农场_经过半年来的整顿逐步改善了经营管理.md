    Shandong Province's state-run model farms in various special districts and counties have gradually improved their management after half a year of vigorous rectification, reducing expenditures, improving production efficiency, and basically reversing the situation of losses. The rectification work began with streamlining institutions and tightening expenditures. According to statistics from 142 farms, a total of 1,043 staff members were reduced, which alone can save the state more than 4 billion yuan annually. At the same time, surplus personnel were used to strengthen various agricultural technology promotion stations; personnel returning to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production also played a significant role in strengthening technical guidance for agricultural producers' cooperatives.
    Due to the education on the general task of the state's transition period during the rectification work, most farm staff members recognized the glorious responsibility of state-run model farms in the state's socialist transformation of agriculture. Consequently, their enthusiasm for production and management has greatly increased. After the reorganization of the Taian Prefectural Commissioner's Office Farm, 13 cadres and 8 workers were reduced, and 3 draft animals were also reduced. However, due to the implementation of the ten-day work plan and the rational use of labor, the production enthusiasm of the staff was brought into play. In the first half of this year, in addition to completing agricultural production tasks, more than 8,000 *Amorpha fruticosa* seedlings were planted; many melons, beans and other crops were planted using wasteland, reducing the use of temporary workers by 144 compared to the same period last year. This year, each agricultural worker at the Jining County Farm cultivated ten more mu of land than last year, and the wheat harvest exceeded the plan by more than 22 percent. According to statistics from 124 farms, this year's total wheat output increased by 39.3 percent compared to last year.
    In terms of cost reduction, the farms have grasped the key to actively opening up fertilizer sources and striving for fertilizer self-sufficiency. Most farms are now close to self-sufficiency in fertilizer. This spring, Shanghe County Farm accumulated more than 1 million catties of fertilizer, which can reduce the expenditure on commercial fertilizer by more than 22 million yuan. In the first half of the year, Changle County Farm accumulated 590,000 catties of fertilizer, an increase of 90,000 catties compared to the same period last year. All crops except for a few cash crops used self-accumulated fertilizer.
    In the past six months, the farms have also made considerable achievements in demonstration and promotion work. This year, the farms across the province can select about 2.5 million catties of improved wheat varieties with significant yield increases in the local area, which can be used for sowing more than 160,000 mu of wheat fields in the autumn. If each mu is calculated to increase production by ten catties, a total of 1.6 million catties of wheat can be increased. In addition, according to statistics from 82 farms, 8,659 head of various female livestock have been mated for farmers in the past six months, which has greatly helped local farmers improve production and increase income.

    山东省各专区和县的示范农场
    经过半年来的整顿逐步改善了经营管理
    山东省各专区和县的国营示范农场经过半年来大力整顿，逐步改善了经营管理，使开支减少、生产效率提高，基本上扭转了亏损局面。整顿工作首先从精简机构，紧缩开支入手，据一百四十二处农场统计，共减少工作人员一千零四十三名，光这一项每年就可以给国家节省开支四十多亿元。同时还以编余人员充实了各农业技术推广站；回乡参加农业生产的人员，也对加强农业生产合作社的技术指导起了很大作用。
    由于在整顿工作中进行了国家过渡时期总任务的教育，大部分农场工作人员，认识到国营示范农场在国家进行农业社会主义改造中应尽的光荣责任，因之，生产积极性和经营管理的积极性大为提高。泰安专署农场整编后减少干部十三人，工人八人，并减少役畜三头，但由于实行了十日工作计划，合理地运用劳力，发挥了职工的生产积极性，今年前半年除完成农业生产任务外，还栽植了紫穗槐八千余墩；利用废地种植了很多瓜、豆等作物，比去年同一时期少用了一百四十四个临时工。济宁县农场今年每个农业工人比去年多耕作土地十亩，麦收产量超额完成计划百分之二十二以上。据一百二十四处农场统计，今年小麦总产量比去年增产百分之三十九点三。
    在降低成本方面，各场抓住了积极开辟肥源，争取施肥自给这一主要关键。现在大部农场施肥已接近自给。商河县农场今年春天积肥一百多万斤，可减少商品肥料开支二千二百多万元。昌乐县农场上半年积肥五十九万斤，比去年同时期增积肥料九万斤，除少数经济作物外，其它农作物全部使用自积肥料。
    半年来各农场在示范推广工作上也取得不少成绩。全省各场今年约能选出在当地增产显著的良种小麦二百五十万斤，可供秋季十六万亩以上麦田播种。如每亩以增产十斤计算，共计可增产小麦一百六十万斤。此外，据八十二处农场统计，半年来给农民的各种母畜配种达八千六百五十九头，这些都对当地农民提高生产、增加收入有极大的帮助。
