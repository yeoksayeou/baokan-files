    Celebrating Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Election as Deputy to the National People's Congress
    People of Yilong County and Ma'an Township, Sichuan Province, Hold Celebration Meetings
    [Chengdu Dispatch, August 9th] The good news of Zhu De, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, being elected as a deputy to the National People's Congress, spread like wind throughout Sichuan. On the evening of the 7th, when the good news was telephoned to the hometown of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De in northern Sichuan—Yilong County and Ma'an Township—people from all walks of life in Yilong County immediately gathered to express their congratulations. Lin Huazhi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Yilong County People's Representative Conference, said: "I was very excited when I heard that Commander-in-Chief Zhu was elected. This 69-year-old person feels younger. Only when our people truly become masters of the house can we elect the people who satisfy us most to manage the affairs of the country." Xie Dayuan, Director of the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative and Provincial Model Worker, said: "Without the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we would not have our happy today. I will take the action of doing a good job in the autumn harvest and completing the production increase task to congratulate Commander-in-Chief Zhu's election!"
    The people of Ma'an Township, the birthplace of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, also held a celebration meeting of more than 4,000 people that day. The meeting unanimously passed a congratulatory telegram to Commander-in-Chief Zhu, which stated: "We feel that electing you is the glory of our entire country, province, and township. The people of the whole township will guarantee the completion of the production increase plan, do a good job in the autumn harvest, practice thrift, sell surplus grain to the country, support national industrialization, and contribute all our strength to strive for the early liberation of Taiwan."
    The good news spread to factories and military camps, setting off a wave of jubilation everywhere. Chang Shuanggen, from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, who was training, said: "Commander-in-Chief Zhu's election as a deputy to the National People's Congress is the glory of the entire army and the people of the whole country. We must resolutely respond to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's call at the 'August 1st' anniversary meeting, strengthen political and military training, heighten our vigilance, and strive to liberate Taiwan and defend the motherland!"
