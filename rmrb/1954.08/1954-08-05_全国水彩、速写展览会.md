    National Watercolor and Sketch Exhibition
    Wu Zuoren
    After several months of preparation, the National Watercolor and Sketch Exhibition has opened. In terms of the scope of the producing regions, this exhibition is the first of its kind since 1949; to hold a national exhibition specifically for watercolors and sketches is also unprecedented.
    Since the national liberation in 1949, new Chinese art has been constantly growing and developing. However, in the past five years, in our artistic creation activities, everyone inevitably has this feeling: why are there so few works? This is by no means to say that our artistic field has been barren during this period and has become a "barren land." On the contrary, in recent years, we have published more than 2,200 kinds of New Year pictures alone, not to mention other illustrations and comic strips. But if we look at the quality of the works, then we are far from being satisfied with these. Here, I am not saying that the content of our existing creations is entirely inappropriate, but that these contents are gradually deviating from the reality of life and falling into the tendency of slogan-like and cliché-ridden expressions. Formulaic and generalized works can only increase public fatigue and fail to achieve the effect of education and encouragement. We require artists to give full play to their creative potential in various techniques and to reflect more aspects of the new society, with its new things and new atmospheres that can be seen everywhere today. As painters of today's New China, facing the great socialist construction of the motherland, can we remain indifferent and without feeling?
    After the enlarged meeting of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Fine Arts Workers last September, the Chinese Artists Association, which was reorganized and established, according to the resolutions of the Second Congress of Chinese Literature and Art Workers, and in view of the above-mentioned situation, further launched a large-scale art creation movement under the principle of educating the people with socialist spirit, calling for expanding the scope of creative themes and encouraging the diversification of forms and styles. Thanks to the efforts of art groups and art workers in various places, in the past year, various kinds of art works have been transported from all regions of the country to Beijing. These are the fruits of the hard work of our artists. This National Watercolor and Sketch Exhibition is exhibited under such circumstances. On the one hand, it allows watercolor and sketch works by painters from all over the country to meet the public collectively. On the other hand, it aims to stimulate the enthusiasm of artists under the collective encouragement and care of the public, so that creative activities can become more prosperous and improve the level of creation.
    Most of the works exhibited this time reflect the magnificent natural scenery of the great motherland, and some also reflect the struggle and transformation of nature carried out by the Chinese working people on the land of the motherland with high enthusiasm under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. These new era figures, full of confidence, determined and brave expressions; the lovely mountains and rivers of the motherland, the rich mines, the dense forests, the boundless sea, and even the small scenes full of lyrical poetry, the freshness and prosperity of every flower and tree, our painters, whether in watercolors or sketches, can generally give full play to the characteristics of the technique and portray them concisely and richly.
    However, we cannot deny, and should point out, that some shortcomings also exist. As mentioned earlier, the tendency of formulaic and generalized creation still exists in this exhibition. We see that in individual works, the author's intention may be to express the various great construction projects currently being carried out in the motherland, but in terms of subject matter, the author has not given enough thought to how to reflect the labor enthusiasm of socialist construction, and only focuses on expressing the layers of scaffolding or the tall cranes; of course, these are not impossible to describe, and sometimes need to be described; but it must not be forgotten that describing people's labor and struggle is more important.
    Secondly, in terms of giving different expression functions to different expression techniques, some individual works are also unsatisfactory. A relief cannot be the same as a painting, and a watercolor or colored ink painting cannot be equal to an oil painting. Therefore, we cannot demand that watercolors and oil paintings have the same expressive functions, because the performance of their tools and materials is fundamentally different. If we use watercolors, overlapping and rendering, or even thickly applying colors, so that the picture loses the unique clear, transparent, and light feeling of watercolors, and finally fails to imitate the richness and depth of oil paintings, but can only be full of dullness and rigidity.
    There are also works that excessively emphasize the processing and depiction of details, seemingly without losing a hair. Perhaps the author thinks that being lifelike is complete and profound. In fact, it is not. This kind of isolated depiction of details, this kind of depiction without selection and without understanding the organic unity of the object, results in the details being prominent, the primary and secondary being indistinguishable, and becoming a chaotic and noisy "work," which is not in line with the realistic expression method.
    Regarding sketches, we should not only recognize that they are a means of artistic expression, but also a form of expression in painting art. At the same time, it should be admitted that this is an exercise that artists must adhere to throughout their lives, and like other basic exercises, it is an important task that cannot be neglected. Painters from ancient times to the present, both in China and abroad, almost always have sketchbooks with them. Sketching is the main step for painters to face life, to go into life, to explore the images and dynamics of people or things, to always keep a sharp eye on the surroundings of life, to be able to feel something at any time and anywhere, and to be able to write down those fleeting and difficult to repeat moving scenes at any time. Sketching is of course for the requirements of creation, to prepare for creation. But it is not limited to collecting materials for creation. All vivid content and images come from real life.
    In order to correct following old ways and clichés and to give play to creativity, sketching is important to us. To overcome producing works from the formula of ready-made works, it is necessary to first be familiar with life, observe life, and express life, and to produce works from life. And sketching is a direct reflection of life experience, which is concise, substantial, rich, and flexible.
    Since the works exhibited this time are limited to watercolors and sketches, among the various art works sent from all over the country, those well-drawn sketch exercises or other forms of painting have to be retained and await future opportunities to be displayed to the audience in other appropriate exhibitions.

### 全国水彩、速写展览会

    全国水彩、速写展览会
    吴作人
    全国水彩、速写展览会经几个月的筹备后开幕了。这样的展出，从出品地区范围来说，是一九四九年以来的第一次；以水彩、速写来专门举行全国性的展览，则在以前更不曾有过。
    从一九四九年全国解放以后，新中国美术是在不断地成长和发展着，但是五年来，在我们艺术创作的活动上，大家却还不免有这样的感觉：作品为什么这样贫乏啊！这绝不是说我们的艺术园地在这个时期内是荒芜得成了“不毛之地”；相反，这些年来，单是年画我们就出版了二千二百种以上，慢说其他插图和连环画了。但是我们如果从作品的质量来看，那么我们就还远远地不能满足于这些。这里，我不是说我们已有的创作内容尽不恰当，而是说这些内容正在渐渐脱离生活的真实，落到标语口号式的、陈词滥调的倾向。公式化、一般化的作品只能增加群众疲乏，而收不到教育鼓舞的作用。我们要求美术家在多种多样的技法方面发挥创作的潜力，更多地反映今天到处可以看得到新事物、新气象的新社会的各个方面。作为今天的新中国的画家，面对着祖国伟大的社会主义建设，难道能无动于中，毫无感受吗？
    去年九月中华全国美术工作者协会全国委员会扩大会议以后，改组成立的中国美术家协会，根据中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会的决议，针对着上述的情况，进一步在以社会主义精神教育人民的原则下，广泛开展了美术创作运动，号召扩大创作题材的范围，鼓励形式和风格的多样化。由于各地美术团体和美术工作者的努力推动，将近一年来，各样的美术作品都从全国各地区运送到北京来，这些，都是我们的美术家辛勤劳动的收获。这次的全国水彩、速写展览会便是在这样的情况下展出的。它一方面可以让全国各地画家的水彩和速写作品集中地和群众见面，另一方面是要求在群众集体的鼓励和关怀下，激发美术家的工作热情，使创作活动更繁荣起来，以提高创作水平。
    这次展出的作品，大部分反映了伟大祖国壮丽的自然面貌，有的并反映了中国劳动人民在中国共产党的领导下，以高度的热情在祖国的大地上对自然所进行的斗争和改造。这些新时代人物的形象，充满自信心的、坚决而勇敢的神情；祖国可爱的山河，藏蕴丰富的矿山，茂密的森林，无边的大海以至充满抒情诗意的小景，一花一木的鲜妍向荣，我们的画家，不论在水彩或速写中，一般都能发挥技法的特性，简练而丰盛的描绘了出来。
    但是，我们不能否认，并应该指出同时存在着的一些缺点。在前面已经说过创作上公式化、一般化的倾向，在这次展出中，也还是存在着的。我们看到有个别作品，作者的意图也许是想表现祖国当前所进行的种种伟大的建设工程，但是在取材上，作者对如何来反映社会主义建设的劳动热情却是思考得很不够的，而仅仅致力于表现层层搭起的木架，或高高伸着的起重机；当然这些并不是不可以描写，而且有时是需要描写的；但是不能忘记，描写人的劳动和斗争是更重要的。
    其次，在不同的表现技法发挥不同的表现功能这方面，有个别的作品也是令人感到不够的。一面浮雕不能相同于一幅画，一幅水彩或彩墨画，也不能等于是一幅油画。所以我们不能要求水彩和油画有同等的表现功能，因为它们的工具材料的性能就根本有区别。假如我们使用水彩时，重叠渲染，甚至厚敷颜色，致画面失去水彩所特有的清丽、透明、轻快的感觉，终于也仿效不到油画的浓郁、深厚，而只能是满纸沉浊板滞。
    还有的作品，是过份强调细节的加工描绘，似乎不失毫发。也许作者以为维妙维肖就是完整，就是精深。其实不是，这样孤立地描摹细节，这种不加取舍，不体会对象有机统一的描绘结果，是细节突出，主从不分，成为一幅纷陈喧嚣的“作品”，与现实主义的表现方法是不相符合的。
    关于速写，我们不仅应该认识到它是艺术表现的一种手段，也是绘画艺术中的一种表现形式。同时应该承认这是艺术家必须毕生坚持的一种锻炼，和其他基础锻炼一样，是不可偏废的一项重要的工作。古今中外的画家，差不多都是经常速写册不离身的。速写是画家面向生活的主要步骤，到生活中去，发掘人或物的形象和动态，对生活周遭，经常睁开着敏锐的眼睛，随时随地都可有所感受，也就能随时写下那些稍纵即逝、难再重复的动人景象。速写当然是为了创作的要求，做创作的准备。但也不限于为创作搜集素材，一切生动的内容和形象都是从真实的生活中来的。
    为了纠正因袭、老套，发挥创造力，速写对我们是重要的。要克服从现成作品的公式里出作品，是必须首先熟悉生活，观察生活，表现生活，从生活里产生作品。而速写正是生活感受的直接反映，是简练充实、丰富灵活的。
    由于这次展出的作品只限于水彩和速写，全国各地运送来的各样美术作品中，那些画得很好的素描习作，或其他形式的绘画，都不得不保留着以待将来举办其他适当的展览会时再与观众们见面。
