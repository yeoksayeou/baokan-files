The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Commerce, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives recently jointly issued a notice requiring all regions to strengthen the prevention and control of overwintering pink bollworm.

The notice stated: Pink bollworm causes cotton to drop buds, flowers, and bolls, resulting in hardened petals and rotten bolls, which seriously threatens cotton production and quality, and also restricts cotton exports. All regions must actively carry out prevention and control. Since the vast majority of pink bollworms have already been latent within the seed cotton after the cotton is harvested, controlling overwintering pink bollworms is the most effective and easy-to-implement method. In regions with a foundation for controlling overwintering pink bollworm, gradually expand the control efforts; in general regions, focus on promoting it. After harvesting the cotton, immediately focus on two key aspects: sun-drying the cotton and storing the seed cotton. Promote methods such as using curtain frames for sun-drying, ironing the curtain frames, and covering the cotton piles in farmers' homes. Mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives with the means can promote chemical control. Cotton purchasing stations, processing plants (ginning, baling, oil pressing), and warehouses, workshops, and packaging materials of state-owned farms should be sprayed with pesticides on time, cleaned regularly, and the cotton dregs should be carefully disposed of. Relevant departments at all levels should immediately formulate practical and feasible plans for controlling overwintering pink bollworm based on the actual situation, concentrating efforts and cooperating in division of labor at cotton purchasing stations and processing plants: the agricultural departments are responsible for technical instruction and guidance, and personnel should be sent to the factories during processing and packaging to assist in technical inspection; the supply and marketing cooperatives are responsible for the preparation and supply of pesticides; cotton purchasing stations, processing plants, and state-owned farms must each designate specific personnel to take charge of this work, and reverse the tendency to only process cotton without controlling pests. Cotton seeds stored and exported by farms must be disinfected to ensure that overwintering pink bollworms are killed. To effectively implement this work, relevant units in the provinces should promptly organize forces to conduct thorough inspections of the work of various departments, and regularly report and exchange experiences.

    中央农业部等通知各地防除越冬红铃虫
    中央人民政府农业部、商业部、中华全国供销合作总社最近联合发出通知，要求各地加强防除越冬红铃虫。
    通知说：红铃虫造成棉花落蕾、落花、落铃、僵瓣和烂铃等现象，严重威胁棉花的产量与质量，也限制了棉花的输出。各地必须积极进行除治。由于极大部分红铃虫在收花后都已潜伏在籽棉以内，因此，除治越冬红铃虫是比较最有效而易于执行的办法。在除治越冬红铃虫有基础的地区，逐步扩大除治，一般地区，重点推行。收花后，应立即抓紧晒花和籽棉贮放两个环节：在农家推行帘架晒花、烫花帘子、花堆上盖覆盖物等方法，有条件的互助组或农业生产合作社可提倡药剂除治。收花站、加工厂（轧花、打包、榨油）及国营农场的仓库、车间、包装物等，按时喷药，适时清扫和认真处理花渣。各级有关部门应即根据实际情况，联合制定除治越冬红铃虫的切实可行的计划，集中力量，在收花站、加工厂进行分工合作：由农业部门负责技术传授与指导，在加工和包装期间派员驻厂协助进行技术检查；供销合作社负责药剂准备与供应；收花站、加工厂及国营农场均须各指定专人掌握这一工作，并扭转只加工而不治虫的偏向，农场贮备和输出的棉种，均须经过消毒处理，保证杀死越冬红铃虫。为了切实贯彻这一工作，省各有关单位应及时组织力量，深入检查各部门工作，并随时通报交流经验。
