Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 9th: Paris dispatch: The French National Assembly, on the 6th, passed the agenda for the recent period of the National Assembly meetings by 514 votes to 100, which stipulates that the "European Army" issue will be debated on August 24th. Communist Party members voted against it.

French Prime Minister Mendès France was unwilling to clarify whether this debate would make a decision on the issue of ratifying the "European Army" treaty, but only vaguely stated that the debate would discuss the reports passed by the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee and Defense Committee opposing the "European Army" treaty, any other counter-proposals, and the entire European issue.

Reuters said that Mendès France is trying to draft a compromise proposal on the controversial "European Army" treaty to be submitted to the "European Army" six-nation conference in Brussels on August 19th for discussion, and to the French National Assembly for approval on August 24th.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 9th: Paris dispatch: The Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly passed a resolution on the 6th, refusing to separate the Bonn Treaty, which stipulates that West Germany should be granted "sovereignty," and the Paris Treaty, which stipulates the establishment of the "European Army," as requested by the United States.

The Bonn Treaty originally stipulated that it would only come into effect after the Paris Treaty came into effect. In this way, West Germany cannot establish an army before the Paris Treaty comes into effect. Therefore, the United States wants to separate these two treaties in order to freely arm West Germany alone, and use France's fear of the revival of German militarism to force France to immediately ratify the "European Army" treaty.

Three days before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly made the above decision, Senator Debre spoke at a meeting of the Council of the Republic, denouncing the attitude of the United States and demanding that the French government reject the unreasonable oppression of the United States. He said: "We must not kneel before our allies. France has the right to be respected, and it must reject this threat and blackmail."

    法国国民议会定期辩论“欧洲军”问题
    议会外交委员会反对美国胁迫法国批准“欧洲军”条约
    【新华社九日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会在六日以五百一十四票对一百票通过了最近一个时期国民议会会议的日程，其中规定要在八月二十四日辩论“欧洲军”问题。共产党议员投反对票。
    法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯不肯说明这次辩论是不是要对批准“欧洲军”条约的问题作出决定，而只是含糊其辞地说，这次辩论要讨论国民议会外交委员会和国防委员会所通过的反对“欧洲军”条约的报告、其他任何反建议以及整个欧洲问题。
    路透社说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯正在设法就争论中的“欧洲军”条约拟出一项折衷方案，以便提交八月十九日在布鲁塞尔举行的“欧洲军”六国会议讨论，并且在八月二十四日提交法国国民议会批准。
    【新华社九日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会外交委员会在六日通过决议，拒绝按照美国的要求把规定要给予西德“主权”的波恩条约和规定建立
  “欧洲军”的巴黎条约分开来。
    波恩条约原来规定要等巴黎条约生效后才能生效。这样，在巴黎条约生效前，西德就不能建立军队。因此，美国要把这两个条约分开，以便放手单独武装西德，并且利用法国对于德国军国主义复活的畏惧，迫使法国立即批准“欧洲军”条约。
    在法国国民议会外交委员会作出上述决定前三天，参议员德勃尔在共和国参议院会议上发言斥责美国的态度，并要求法国政府拒绝美国的无理压迫。他说：“不得向我们的盟国屈膝。法国有权利受到尊敬，它必须拒绝这种威胁和讹诈。”
