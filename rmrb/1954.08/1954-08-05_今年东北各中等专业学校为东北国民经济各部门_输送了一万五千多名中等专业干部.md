    This year, secondary vocational schools in Northeast China have supplied more than 15,000 mid-level professional cadres to various sectors of the region's national economy, with over 6,000 graduates from engineering schools. Some of these graduates are already serving as probationary technicians in national mines, factories, state-owned farms, and water conservancy projects. After arriving at construction sites such as the Dahuofang Reservoir in May, the 141 graduates of the Northeast Water Conservancy School have become the backbone of various grassroots engineering units. One hundred students who went to the Dahuofang Reservoir have served as construction workers and construction team leaders in various work sections, leading workers in dam construction, soil testing, water diversion tunnel excavation, and grouting. Students in the second, third, and fifth work sections have been able to arrange construction for 500 people. Practical work has proven that the students possess the management and basic operational skills of various mid-level technicians. Relevant departments have also expressed their appreciation for their achievements.
    Since 1953, secondary vocational schools in Northeast China have successively carried out teaching reforms, which have had a positive impact on the quality of this year's graduates. Before the teaching reform, the construction courses at the Northeast Water Conservancy School were taught entirely based on the outdated experience of old China. Starting in the second semester of 1953, teachers collected advanced Soviet teaching materials and taught according to advanced Soviet construction techniques, enabling students to master advanced working methods such as mechanized construction and construction according to instruction charts.

    今年东北各中等专业学校为东北国民经济各部门
    输送了一万五千多名中等专业干部
    今年，东北区中等专业学校为全区国民经济的各个部门输送了一万五千多名中等专业干部，其中工科学校毕业的学生在六千名以上。这批毕业生有的已经在国家的矿山、工厂、国营农场和水利工程部门担任见习技术员的职务。东北水利学校一百四十一名毕业生从五月份到达大伙房水库等工地后，已成为各基层工程单位的骨干力量。一百名到大伙房水库的学生在各个工段做了施工员和施工员班长，领导工人进行了大坝施工、土壤试验、输水洞穿凿和灌浆等工作。在第二、第三、第五工段的学生有的已经能够布置五百人的施工了。经过实际工作证明，学生们已经具备了各种中级技术人员的经营管理和基本操作能力。各业务部门对他们的成绩也表示赞许。
    东北各中等专业学校从一九五三年开始先后进行了教学改革，对今年毕业生的质量起了良好的影响。东北水利学校的施工课程在教学改革前完全是根据已经陈旧的旧中国的经验讲授的。从一九五三年第二学期开始，教师们搜集了苏联先进教材，按照苏联先进的施工技术进行讲授，使学生掌握了机械化施工和按照指示图表施工等先进的工作方法。
