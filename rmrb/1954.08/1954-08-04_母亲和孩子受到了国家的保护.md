Mothers and Children Are Protected by the State
Yang Yumei, Female Salt Worker, Guanxi Salt Field, Northern Jiangsu Saltworks

I was truly happy when I heard the good news of the draft constitution being published. The draft constitution stipulates that "mothers and children are protected by the state," something that the older generations never heard of. I am an ordinary female salt worker, and I suffered countless tortures in the society ruled by the exploiting classes. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionary government simply didn't consider us mothers and our children as human beings, let alone protect us.

Before liberation, I gave birth to six children in total; now only one is still alive. I will never forget the suffering of giving birth to these six children. At that time, our female workers had no maternity leave at all. Pregnant female workers had to work on the salt flats until the day they went into labor. I remember when I gave birth to my second child, the capitalist's henchmen forced me to work only two or three days after the child was born. How could I bear it! But there was no way out, so I had to grit my teeth and work for the capitalist. My body was weak, and I had nothing in my stomach, which made me dizzy... At the time, I thought: Even a hen needs to rest after laying an egg, yet we women are not even as good as a chicken, and are not allowed to rest for a few days after giving birth! But who could I tell these sufferings to? I could only swallow them in my stomach!

When I was pregnant with my third child, I gave birth to twins. At that time, poor families were all eating seaweed and grass seeds. My husband was a hardworking man who could endure hardship, but he was busy working hard all day long and couldn't take care of the family's food and drink; he himself was as thin as a rake, with bulging veins like earthworms. At that time, our family was so hungry that we were "only fat in the eyes, not growing any meat," and we didn't have any money to nourish myself during the postpartum period. We often picked some locust flowers and cooked them as food, but eating such "food" made it impossible for me to produce milk to feed the children. As a result, in less than ten days, my two children starved to death... I don't know how many tears I swallowed for my children!

Since the liberation of the salt field, our lives have been very different. We workers have become masters of our own affairs, and our lives are getting better day by day. In the past four or five years, I have given birth to three more children. In order to protect the safety of us mothers and children, the state has sent new-style midwives to deliver my babies each time I was about to give birth. The state also stipulates that women have a 56-day maternity leave before and after childbirth, and wages are paid at the original rate during the leave. In order to take care of mothers with many children, the state set up a temporary nursery for our production team this year during the busy production season. In this way, we work even harder on the salt flats. Now my eldest child is already a first-grade elementary school student; the workers in the team all praise the three younger children, saying that "they look like chubby dolls." How can they not be chubby? They all grew up eating rice and white flour. In the old society, I wouldn't have dared to dream of these things, but now they are all facts. From my personal experience, doesn't this fully prove that mothers and children are protected by the state! Ironclad facts are the truth! Comparing the past miserable days with today's happy life is like comparing two different worlds, how can it not make me happy!

Now, the draft constitution has fixed the benefits that our people have already obtained. It is like the sun, illuminating the socialist path we should take and guaranteeing that our situation will get better day by day. This is the reason why I wholeheartedly support the draft constitution. In the future, I must better fulfill my obligations, work harder, and do everything I can to complete this year's production tasks together with the male workers and build our own country.

### 母亲和孩子受到了国家的保护

    母亲和孩子受到了国家的保护
    淮北盐场灌西场女盐工　杨玉梅
    我听到宪法草案公布的喜讯的时候，真是高兴极了。宪法草案里规定了“母亲和儿童受国家的保护”，真是老辈子也没有听说过的事。我是一个普通的女盐工，在剥削阶级统治的社会里，不知受了多少折磨。那时候，国民党反动政府根本不把我们做母亲的和我们的儿女看在眼上，也就更谈不上保护了。
    解放以前，我一共生了六个孩子；现在活着的只剩下一个。我一辈子也忘记不了生这六个孩子的苦情。那时候，我们女工生孩子，根本没有产假。女工怀了孕，要在滩上做工做到临产的那天为止。记得我生第二个孩子的时候，孩子刚生下两三天，资本家的狗腿子就逼着我去作工。我哪里能支撑得住啊！可是又没有办法，只得咬紧牙关给资本家干活。身子弱，肚里又没有东西，累得我头晕打转……。当时我想：老母鸡下个蛋还要卧卧呢，我们女人竟连个鸡都不如，生个孩子连休息几天都不许啊！可是这些苦楚向谁说呢？只有朝肚里咽罢了！
    到了第三胎，我生了一对双生子。那时候，穷人们家家都吃海草，吃草种子。我的丈夫是个能受苦能干活的人，可是他整天拚命卖力气，也顾不上一家人的吃喝；他自己瘦得皮包骨头，青筋鼓起像曲蟮（蚯蚓）一样。那时候，我们一家子饿得真是“只见眼胖，不见肉长”，更没有钱给我在月子里调养。我们常常摘点杨槐树花煮煮当饭吃，可是吃了这样的“饭”，怎么也淌不下奶汁喂孩子，这样不到十几天，我的两个孩子就活活地给饿死了……。为了孩子，我不知咽下了多少眼泪啊！
    自从盐场解放以后，我们的生活就大不同了。我们工人当家做了主人，日子过得一天比一天好。四、五年来，我又生了三个孩子。国家为了保护我们母子安全，在我每次临产的时候，都派来新法接生员给我接产。国家还规定了妇女产前产后休假五十六天，休假期间，工资按照原数发给。国家为了照顾多孩子的母亲，在今年生产较忙的时候，又给我们生产组办了一个临时托儿所。这样一来，我们在滩上干活，更格外起劲。如今我的那个大孩子，已经是一年级的小学生了；那三个年岁小的孩子，组里的工人们都夸奖说“长得像胖娃娃似的”。他们怎能不胖呢，他们都是吃大米、白面长大的。这些事情，在旧社会里，我就是做梦也不敢想的，可是现在都是事实。从我的切身体验来说，这不是完全证明母亲和儿童受到国家的保护了吗！铁一般的事实就是真理！过去的苦日子和今天的幸福生活一比，真是两样天地，怎能不叫我欢喜！
    现在，宪法草案把我们人民已经得到的利益固定了下来，它又像太阳一样，照亮了我们应走的社会主义道路，保证我们的光景一天比一天好，这就是我全心全意地拥护宪法草案的理由。今后，我一定要更好地尽我的义务，更好地劳动，尽一切力量和男工一道完成今年的生产任务，建设我们自己的国家。（曲人记）
