    Xinhua News Agency, August 17th, TASS dispatch, August 15th: In light of the provocative attack by Japanese fascist "Patriotic Party" thugs on August 9th, the Soviet delegation to Japan delivered a statement to the Japanese Foreign Ministry on August 14th. The statement said:
    A group of troublemakers and hooligans from the Japanese fascist organization "Patriotic Party," led by Akio Satoshi, attacked the Soviet delegation in Tokyo on August 9, 1954. These thugs broke down the gate, rushed into the delegation's courtyard, beat a Soviet citizen, Khudushkin, who was in the yard at the time, posted anti-Soviet leaflets and slogans, and attempted to enter the Soviet delegation's building. This atrocity occurred in front of a large number of Japanese police officers, who failed to take the necessary measures to stop Akio Satoshi and his accomplices from carrying out this intolerable behavior. Therefore, this constitutes a heinous act of violence against the Soviet delegation in Tokyo, in violation of basic international norms.
    The Soviet delegation calls the attention of the Japanese Foreign Ministry to the above-mentioned facts, and hopes that the Japanese authorities will take the necessary measures to severely punish the criminals who have committed the above-mentioned heinous crimes against the Soviet delegation, and prevent such incidents from happening in the future.

    就日本法西斯党徒的挑衅性袭击
    苏联驻日本代表团向日外务省提出声明
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社十五日讯：苏联驻日本代表团鉴于在八月九日遭受日本法西斯“爱国党”党徒的一次挑衅性的袭击，已在八月十四日交给日本外务省一份声明。声明说：
    日本法西斯组织“爱国党”的以赤尾敏为首的一批捣乱分子和流氓在一九五四年八月九日袭击了苏联在东京的代表团。这些暴徒在击毁了大门以后，冲进了代表团的院子，殴打了当时在院子里的一位苏联公民胡都什金，张贴反苏传单和标语，并企图进入苏联代表团的房屋。这次暴行是在大批日本警察的面前发生的，而日本警察竟没有采取必要措施来制止赤尾敏和他的同谋者这种不可容忍的行为。因此，这就对苏联驻东京代表团犯下了违反基本国际准则的恶劣暴行。
    苏联代表团提请日本外务省注意上述事实，希望日本当局采取必要措施，严惩对苏联代表团犯有上述恶劣罪行的罪犯，并防止将来发生这类事件。
