Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles once again made provocative remarks hostile to the Chinese people at a press conference on the 24th. Dulles said: The U.S. government's "basic instructions to the U.S. Navy are to defend the island of Taiwan. The nearby islands controlled by the Kuomintang are related to the defense of Taiwan." Dulles indicated that the question of using force to prevent the Chinese people from liberating these islands would be decided by the military, and "the State Department will agree with the military's assessment of this necessity." These words of Dulles exposed the ambition of the United States to use force to protect Taiwan and other Chinese islands occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, and exposed the ambition of the United States to further expand its aggression against Chinese territory. Although Dulles deliberately spoke in a roundabout way to cover up this ambition, spokesmen for the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense announced on the 23rd that the U.S. Seventh Fleet had been ordered to expand its aggressive activities to the Penghu Islands. A spokesman for the U.S. Navy Department even threatened that if the Chinese people liberated Jinmen Island off the coast of Fujian, the Seventh Fleet might intervene.

Dulles also indicated that after attending the meeting in the Philippines on September 6 to discuss the establishment of a Southeast Asian military bloc, he might go to Taiwan and Japan to conduct conspiratorial activities.

When talking about the Southeast Asian military bloc planned by the United States, Dulles said that the Southeast Asia Treaty should be drafted in accordance with the U.S.-Australia-New Zealand Pact and the U.S.-Republic of Korea "mutual defense treaty." Dulles also revealed that the United States is considering dividing the Southeast Asia Treaty into military and economic parts in order to use the economic part to lure other Asian countries into the Southeast Asia bloc.

    杜勒斯又发表敌视中国的谈话
    表示将用武力阻挠我解放沿海岛屿
    【新华社二十六日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯二十四日在记者招待会上又一次发表了敌视中国人民的挑衅谈话。杜勒斯说：美国政府“对美国海军的基本指示是保卫台湾本岛。国民党控制的附近的岛屿是跟台湾的防务有关系的。”杜勒斯表示，用武力阻止中国人民解放这些岛屿的问题将由军方作出决定，“国务院将同意军方对这种必要性的估计”。杜勒斯这些话暴露了美国要用武力来庇护台湾和中国大陆之间蒋匪盘踞的其他中国岛屿的野心，暴露了美国要进一步扩大侵略中国领土的野心。虽然杜勒斯为了掩饰这种野心，故意把话说得藏头露尾，但是美国国务院和国防部的发言人在二十三日就宣布说，美国第七舰队已经奉命将它的侵略活动扩大到澎湖列岛。美国海军部的发言人并且威胁说，如果中国人民解放福建沿海的金门岛，第七舰队可能进行干涉。
    杜勒斯还表示，他在参加九月六日在菲律宾举行的讨论成立东南亚军事集团的会议以后，可能到台湾和日本去进行阴谋活动。
    杜勒斯在谈到美国所策划的东南亚军事集团时表示，东南亚公约应该按照美、澳、新公约和美、李“共同防御条约”的样子来拟订。杜勒斯还透露，美国正在考虑将东南亚公约分成军事的和经济的两部分，以便用经济的部分来把亚洲其他国家诱骗进东南亚集团。
