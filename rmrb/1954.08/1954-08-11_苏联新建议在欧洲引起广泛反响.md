Xinhua News Agency, August 8th - The Soviet government's proposal to convene a four-power conference of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States to discuss arrangements for a European collective security conference has evoked a wide reaction in European countries.

    Circles in Poland have expressed a warm welcome to the Soviet proposal for a four-power conference. Jerzy Suchocki, President of the Polish Institute of International Affairs, said: The painful experience of the two world wars proves that a collective security system should be established to guarantee the peace of all European countries and prevent the revival of German militarism. Farmer Bolesław Sak said: We know that farmers in France, Italy, Britain, and Germany want to live peaceful and stable lives like us. We believe that a conference of representatives of various countries like the Geneva Conference will surely bring some achievements.

    Paris newspapers have prominently published detailed reports of the Soviet government's proposal. A dispatch from Agence France-Presse said that experts from the three countries will consider the new Soviet proposal in London, and at the same time will draft a reply to the previous Soviet note. "Liberation" said when talking about this news: "This news cannot satisfy us. Indeed, for France, the most important issue today is not a technical issue that can be decided by experts. What is needed now is a fundamental political decision that determines the future of our country." "Liberation" believes that "there is now a full possibility of resolving the German issue and the issue of collective security for European countries through consultation." It said: "The Soviet government has once again friendly suggested to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States to convene a four-power conference in August or September to prepare for this consultation. How can a government that truly desires peace reject this proposal that is in the interests of the people of all countries?"

    Many British newspapers have also prominently published news about the latest note from the Soviet government. The "Yorkshire Post" commented on the Soviet government's statement that, no matter how the Western countries doubt, it will become increasingly difficult for them to ignore Moscow's proposals.

    Italy's "Unità" commented on the recent Soviet proposal, saying that the Soviet government's statement put forward the method that has achieved remarkable success in Geneva, that is, replacing the endless exchange of notes with direct negotiations at the conference table, which is a delaying tactic that Western countries are trying to take again.

    Xinhua News Agency, August 10th - According to TASS: The Soviet Union's proposal for the establishment of European collective security has evoked a good response in West German and French public opinion.

    The Soviet government's statement on August 4th has become the subject of discussion in West German newspapers of various tendencies. The "Neue Ruhr Zeitung" asked the West to answer the Soviet proposal with a cautious "yes." The "Süddeutsche Zeitung" believes that rejecting the Soviet proposal is "risky." The "Westfälische Rundschau" said: "For us Germans, the most important task is to restore the unity of our country. If the new conference can promote this, then we should agree." The "Neue Vorwärts" wrote, "No one will agree that the attempt to save the outdated European Defense Community plan can be used as a reason to refuse new negotiations between East and West on the German and European issues." The press bulletin of the West German Social Democratic Party said that in the Soviet government's note of July 24, "some starting points offer hope of success." The bulletin said that it would be completely wrong to refuse to take advantage of existing opportunities from the outset.

    In France, former Gaullist member of parliament Jacques Soustelle published an article in "Combat," advocating consultation on European security issues. He said: "The French government should have the courage to act in accordance with what I think is the wish of the vast majority of French people, and start negotiations with the East on European issues." When he talked about the saying that such negotiations are bound to fail, he wrote: "Do we have the right to predict failure before trying? Our right and obligation is: first of all, pay attention to the interests of our country. Mendès France knows that the deep intention and hope of the majority who granted him full power and supported him is to liberate our country from the policy of subjugation to Washington that has forced us to accept for a long time."

    苏联新建议在欧洲引起广泛反响
    【新华社八日讯】苏联政府关于召开法、英、苏、美四国会议来讨论安排欧洲集体安全会议的建议在欧洲国家中引起了广泛的反响。
    波兰各界对苏联召开四国会议的建议表示热烈欢迎。波兰国际问题学会会长朱利兹·苏奇发表谈话说：两次世界大战的惨痛经验证明，应当建立保障欧洲所有国家和平和防止德国军国主义复活的集体安全体系。农民波列斯劳·萨克说：我们知道，法国、意大利、英国和德国的农民都希望像我们一样过和平安定的生活。我们认为各国代表举行像日内瓦会议这样的会议一定会带来一些成就。
    巴黎各报都以显著地位详细刊载了苏联政府的建议。法新社的一项消息说，三国专家将在伦敦考虑苏联的新建议，同时并将草拟对苏联的前次照会的答复。“解放报”谈到这个消息时说：“这个消息不能使我们感到满意。的确，对法国来说今天最重要的问题并不是可以由专家们决定的技术问题。现在需要的是一个确定我国前途的根本性的政治决定。”“解放报”认为“现在有通过协商来解决德国问题以及解决欧洲各国集体安全问题的充分可能性”。它说：“苏联政府已再度以友好的态度向法、英、美三国政府建议在八月或九月召开一次四国会议，以便为这种协商进行准备。一个真正希望和平的政府怎么能拒绝这个符合各国人民的利益的建议呢？”
    许多英国报纸也以显著地位登载了关于苏联政府最近一次照会的消息。“约克郡邮报”评论苏联政府的声明说，不论西方国家怎样怀疑，它们将越来越难于忽视莫斯科的建议。
    意大利的“团结报”评论苏联最近的建议说，苏联政府的声明提出了已在日内瓦取得显著成就的方法，即以会议桌上直接谈判的方法来代替无休止地交换照会这种拖延策略，而西方国家是企图再度采取这种拖延策略的。
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社讯：苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全的主张在西德和法国舆论界引起了良好的反响。
    苏联政府八月四日的声明已成为西德各种不同倾向的报纸的讨论主题。“新鲁尔报”要求西方以一个谨慎的“是”字来回答苏联的建议。“南德意志报”认为，拒绝苏联的建议是“冒险的”。“威斯特伐利亚评论”说：“对我们德国人来说，最重要的任务是恢复我们国家的统一，如果新的会议能促进这一点，那么我们就应该同意。”“新前进报”写道，“没有一个人会同意，挽救已经过时的欧洲防务集团计划的企图可以作为拒绝东方和西方就德国和欧洲问题举行新的谈判的理由。”西德社会民主党的新闻公报说，在苏联政府七月二十四日的照会中，“有些出发点提供了成功的希望。”公报说，一开头就拒绝利用现有的机会是完全错误的。
    在法国，前戴高乐派的议员雅克·苏斯戴尔在“战斗报”上发表了一篇文章，主张就欧洲安全问题进行协商。他说：“法国政府应有勇气按照在我看来是绝大多数法国人所希望的那样来办事，就欧洲问题和东方开始进行谈判。”他在谈到所谓这种谈判必遭失败的这种说法时写道：“难道有权利在进行尝试之前就预言失败吗？我们的权利和义务是：首先注意我国的利益。孟戴斯—弗朗斯知道，授予他全权和支持他的大多数人的深切意愿和希望是把我国从长期以来强迫我国接受的那种屈从华盛顿的政策中解放出来。”
