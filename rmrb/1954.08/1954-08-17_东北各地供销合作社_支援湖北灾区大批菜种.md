Xinhua News Agency:

    Following the Northeast China Office of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives' transfer of over 10,000 tons of late-autumn crop seeds to support farmers in flood-stricken areas of Anhui and Hubei provinces to replant late-autumn crops, supply and marketing cooperatives in Shenyang, Harbin, Dalian, Andong, Haicheng, Yixian, Liaoyang, Kaiyuan, and other places have procured more than 140,000 jin of seeds for cabbage, radish, and other vegetables for farmers in flood-stricken areas of Hubei Province. Currently, these seeds have been successively shipped from stations in various locations.

    In the past, supply and marketing cooperatives in Northeast China did not engage in or rarely engaged in the business of these seeds. This time, in order to support farmers in the Jianghuai flood-stricken areas, many regional cooperatives, after receiving instructions from higher-level cooperatives, immediately dispatched personnel to villages and towns to directly purchase the seeds.

    东北各地供销合作社
    支援湖北灾区大批菜种
    中华全国供销合作总社东北区办事处继东北区调出万余吨晚秋作物种籽支援安徽、湖北两省灾区农民补种晚秋作物之后，又在沈阳、哈尔滨、旅大、安东、海城、义县、辽阳、开原等地给湖北省灾区农民收购了十四万多斤白菜、萝卜等种籽。目前这批种籽已陆续从各地车站启运。
    过去东北各地供销合作社不经营或很少经营这些种籽，这次为了支援江淮灾区农民，许多地区的合作社接到上级社的指示后，立即派出工作人员到村、镇去直接收购。　（新华社）
