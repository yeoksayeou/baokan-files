    The Yangtze River water level at Wuhan Customs at 5:00 PM on the 16th was two centimeters higher than at the same time on the 15th, reaching 29.65 meters. After 5:00 PM on the 15th, the Yangtze River water level at Wuhan Customs had remained at 29.63 meters for a long time. It had even dropped one centimeter at 8:00 AM on the 16th, before starting to rise slightly again at 2:00 PM.

    On the 16th, the Yangtze River was rising at all stations from Qingxichang in the upper reaches to Zhijiang in the middle reaches. The water levels at Wuhan, Huangshi, and Wuxue in the middle reaches also rose. The Yangtze River water level in Huangshi City had risen to 26.22 meters by 11:00 AM on the 16th, the highest water level in Huangshi City since the beginning of this flood season, exceeding the local historical high water level by 1.44 meters. The remaining sixteen stations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were falling. The weather in the Yangtze River basin was mostly sunny and clear.

    Currently, the flood prevention teams in Wuhan City have been gradually increased to more than 199,000 people, and the emergency response forces have been strengthened. To prevent major emergencies from occurring, the Wuhan City Flood Control Headquarters has instructed flood control organizations at all levels to universally summarize and exchange emergency response experiences on the 16th and 17th, and to continuously strengthen technical guidance in emergency response work. On the 16th, the reinforcement and heightening project of Zhanggong Hengdi, a second line of defense in the southwest part of Hankou, was basically completed.

    武汉长江水位微涨全市防汛抢险力量加强
    十六日下午五时，武汉关长江水位比十五日同一时间又微涨两公分，升到二九点六五公尺。十五日下午五时以后，武汉关长江水位曾在二九点六三公尺持续很久。十六日晨八时还曾回落一公分，到下午二时才又开始微涨。
    十六日长江自上游清溪场到中游枝江各站都在涨水，中游武汉、黄石市和武穴三站水位也都有上升。黄石市长江水位十六日上午十一时已上升到二六点二二公尺，为今年汛期以来黄石市出现的最高水位，超过当地历年最高水位一点四四公尺。长江中、下游其余的十六个站都在落水。长江流域天气大部晴好。
    现在武汉市防汛队伍已陆续增加到十九万九千多人，抢险力量又有加强。为防止发生重大险情，武汉市防汛总指挥部已指示各级防汛组织，在十六、十七两天内普遍总结交流抢险的经验，并不断地加强抢险工作中的技术指导。十六日，汉口市区西南部分作为第二道防线的张公横堤的加固和加高工程已基本完工。
