New Look of the Bohai Bay Fishing Area

The area near Bohai Bay in Luan County, Changli, Fengrun, Leting, Qinhuangdao, Funing, and Huanghua in Hebei Province is an excellent fishing area, where many fishermen live. Before liberation, the vast fishing grounds and larger fishing gear were controlled by a small number of boat owners. Fishermen worked year-round but could not maintain a minimum standard of living. Their enthusiasm for production was low, and production volume remained at a minimal level for a long time.

After liberation, the vast number of fishermen were emancipated, acquired fishing tools, and became masters of their boats. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and with the active support of the People's Bank and supply and marketing cooperatives, fishing production has rapidly recovered and developed. Currently, in Luan County and four other areas alone, there are more than 1,300 new fishing boats, a twofold increase compared to pre-liberation levels; and more than 49,800 various new fishing nets, a fivefold increase compared to pre-liberation levels. More than 30 fishing production cooperatives and about 300 fishing mutual aid teams have been organized. In Huanghua County, the number of members participating in fishing cooperatives accounts for 23.7 percent of the total number of fishermen, and the number of boats and fishing gear accounts for 21.2 percent. As a result, the scale of fishing production has also expanded year by year. This year, more than 33,000 fishermen went to sea during the spring fishing season, producing more than 78.8 million catties of various aquatic products, with a total value of more than 42 billion yuan. The output value of each region has increased by 10 to 300 percent compared to the same period last year.

With the development of fishing production, the lives of fishermen have undergone fundamental changes. During the spring fishing season this year, members of the Xinxingren mutual aid team in Changli County earned an average of 4.8 million yuan per person, an increase of 150 percent compared to last year. As fishermen's income has increased, their purchasing power has rapidly improved. For example, the supply and marketing cooperative in Liuzan Village, Luan County, supplied more than 2,000 fishermen in the village with daily necessities last year, with sales reaching more than 2 billion yuan, averaging more than 1 million yuan in purchases per person. In Guanjia Fort, Huanghua County, 86 fishing households have built more than 180 new houses from 1951 to the present.

    渤海湾渔区新面貌
    河北省滦县、昌黎、丰润、乐亭、秦皇岛、抚宁和黄骅等地的靠近渤海湾地带，是一个优良的渔业区，这里住着很多渔民。解放前，这里的广大渔场和较大型渔具都掌握在少数船主手中，渔民终年劳动，不能维持最低生活，生产情绪低落，生产量长期停留在最低水平。
    解放后，广大渔民翻了身，获得了治鱼工具，做了船上主人。几年来，在党和人民政府的领导下，经过人民银行和供销合作社的积极扶植，迅速地恢复和发展了渔业生产。目前，仅滦县等五地现已有新渔船一千三百余只，比解放前增加了两倍；各种新渔网四万九千八百多条；比解放前增加了五倍，并组织了渔业生产合作社三十多个，渔业互助组约三百个。黄骅县参加渔业合作社的社员占渔民总人数的百分之二十三点七，船只和渔具占百分之二十一点二。因而渔业生产规模也逐年扩大，今年春汛下海的渔民有三万三千多人，生产各种水产品七千八百多万斤，总值四百二十多亿元，各地区的产值比去年同期增加百分之十到百分之三百不等。
    随着渔业生产的发展，渔民的生活已起了根本变化。昌黎县信兴仁互助组组员在今年春汛期间，每人平均已收入四百八十万元，比去年增加一倍半。渔民的收入增加了，购买力迅速提高。如滦县柳赞村供销合作社去年一年供应该村两千多名渔民生活日用品的销货额即达二十多亿元，平均每人购货额一百多万元。黄骅县关家堡全村八十六户渔民，从一九五一年到现在就盖了新房一百八十多间。
