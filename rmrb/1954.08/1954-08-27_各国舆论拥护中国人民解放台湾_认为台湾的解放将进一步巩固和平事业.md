The Korean "Rodong Sinmun"
    Pyongyang newspapers on the 25th all published the full text of the joint declaration by Chinese democratic parties and people's organizations for the liberation of Taiwan in a prominent position. On the same day, "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial entitled "Taiwan is the Territory of the Chinese People." The editorial said: "Taiwan has been an integral and sacred part of China's territory since ancient times. Taiwan was occupied by Japanese imperialism in 1895. For sixty years, the people of Taiwan have suffered cruel oppression under the yoke of colonial slavery. The Chinese people have never interrupted their struggle to liberate Taiwan. During World War II, the Chinese people launched a great national liberation struggle against Japan in order to liberate all Chinese territory, including Taiwan. Therefore, the 'Cairo Declaration' and the 'Potsdam Proclamation' clearly stipulated that Taiwan must be returned to China. However, while launching the war of aggression against Korea in 1950, US imperialism forcibly occupied China's Taiwan, openly violating the international agreements signed by the US government itself."
    The editorial pointed out: "On August 22nd, the democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China, representing the will of the entire Chinese people, issued a joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan, solemnly declaring that Taiwan is Chinese territory and that the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. This demonstrates the determination of the 600 million Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and their firm will to defend the integrity of their motherland's territory."
    The editorial said: "The Korean people, who are struggling to resolutely complete the unification of their motherland, are convinced that the just cause of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan will be fully realized. The liberation of Taiwan by the Chinese people will be another blow to the imperialist policy of aggression in Asia and will further consolidate the cause of peace. Therefore, the just demand of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan will surely receive the full support and solidarity of peace-loving people all over the world."
    Vietnam "Nhan Dan"
    According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, August 24th: The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published an editorial entitled "Warmly Welcome and Support China's Peaceful Diplomatic Policy."
    After reviewing the main points of the diplomatic report made by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on August 11th, "Nhan Dan" pointed out that China's diplomatic policy has a great impact on peace in Asia and the rest of the world.
    "Nhan Dan" then exposed the US imperialists for creating international tension, provoking China, attempting to undermine the Korean armistice agreement, forming the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and attempting to undermine the collective cooperation of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue. "Nhan Dan" pointed out that US imperialism is currently the main enemy of the peace, independence, and happiness of the people in Asia and the rest of the world.
    When talking about the Taiwan issue, "Nhan Dan" emphasized that the Vietnamese people warmly welcome and resolutely support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan.
    "Nhan Dan" said: The Vietnamese people realize that the five principles put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai, such as mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, are also the basic principles for strengthening the friendly relations between the three Indochinese countries and between them and France, and create favorable conditions for expanding the good relations between the three Indochinese countries and other countries, and the expansion of such good relations is extremely necessary for consolidating peace in Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. There is no doubt that these reasonable principles enjoy the approval and support of peace-loving people and countries all over the world.
    "Nhan Dan" concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people, together with the people of Cambodia and Laos, guarantee to unite closely with the French people and resolutely oppose any conspiracy by the US imperialists and French warmongers and their running dog Ngo Dinh Diem clique. At the same time, the Vietnamese people urge the French government and the countries concerned to strictly implement the agreements reached.
    Czech "Rude Pravo"
    "Rude Pravo" published a commentary in the international review column on the 25th, expressing full support for the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan as expressed in the joint declaration by Chinese democratic parties and people's organizations for the liberation of Taiwan.
    The commentary pointed out that Taiwan has become the main base for the United States to carry out military provocations against China and pirate-like attacks against other peace-loving countries. US weapons that can no longer be used in Indochina are being shipped to Taiwan. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, under the orders of the US imperialists, is preparing cannon fodder for such provocative actions. Peace-loving people all over the world are deeply indignant at the shameless and blatant actions of the United States in instigating another war in the Far East.
    The commentary went on to point out that "returning Taiwan to China is in the interests of peace-loving people all over the world. The Chinese people hope to live in peace with all countries on the basis of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. They have no intention of launching aggression against any other country, but they will not allow others to launch any aggression against them. They are only asking for the island of Taiwan, which has always belonged to China. The liberation of Taiwan is entirely China's internal affair, and the Chinese people will never allow any foreign interference."

专栏：

    各国舆论拥护中国人民解放台湾
    认为台湾的解放将进一步巩固和平事业
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”
    平壤各报二十五日都以显著地位刊载了中国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言的全文。“劳动新闻”同日发表以“台湾是中国人民的”为题的社论。社论说：“台湾自古以来就是中国神圣的和不可分割的领土的一部分。台湾在一八九五年被日本帝国主义侵占。六十年以来台湾人民在殖民地奴隶的枷锁下，遭受了残酷的压榨。中国人民从未中断过解放台湾的斗争。在第二次世界大战期间，中国人民为了解放包括台湾在内的全部中国领土，展开了伟大的抗日民族解放斗争。因此，在‘开罗宣言’和‘波茨坦公告’中明确规定：台湾必须归还中国。但是，美帝国主义在一九五零年发动侵朝战争的同时，强占了中国的台湾，公然违反了美国政府自己参加签署的国际协定。”
    社论指出：“八月二十二日，中华人民共和国各民主党派、各人民团体代表全中国人民的意志，发表了为解放台湾的联合宣言，严正宣告：台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。这表明了六万万中国人民解放台湾的决心和保卫自己祖国领土完整的坚强斗志。”
    社论说：“正在为坚决完成自己祖国的统一而斗争的朝鲜人民确信：中国人民解放台湾的正义事业必将完全实现。中国人民解放台湾，将是对帝国主义在亚洲的侵略政策的又一个打击，并将进一步巩固和平的事业。因此，中国人民解放台湾的正义要求必将受到全世界爱好和平人民完全的支持和声援。”
    越南“人民报”
    据越南通讯社北越二十四日讯：越南“人民报”以“热烈欢迎和支持中国的和平外交政策”为题发表社论。
      “人民报”在追述了周恩来总理兼外长八月十
  一日所作的外交报告的要点之后，指出中国的外交政策对亚洲和世界其他地方的和平有着巨大的影响。
     “人民报”接着揭露了美帝国主义者制造国际紧张局势、向中国进行挑衅、力图破坏朝鲜停战协定、成立东南亚侵略集团并企图破坏日内瓦会议与会国家在印度支那问题上进行集体合作。“人民报”指出，美帝国主义者目前已经是亚洲及世界其他地方的人民的和平、独立和幸福的主要敌人。
    “人民报”在谈到台湾问题时强调指出：越南人民热烈拥护和坚决支持中国人民解放台湾的斗争。
    “人民报”说：越南人民认识到：周恩来总理所提出的互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处等五项原则也是加强印度支那三国相互间以及它们和法国间的友好关系的基本原则，并为扩大印度支那三国和其他国家的良好关系创造了有利的条件，而这种良好关系的扩大对巩固东南亚和世界其他各地的和平是极其必要的。毫无疑问，这些合理的原则享有着全世界爱好和平的人民和国家的赞同和支持。
    “人民报”最后说：越南人民和柬埔寨与老挝人民一道，保证与法国人民紧密地团结起来，坚决反对美帝国主义者和法国主战分子以及他们的走狗吴庭艳集团的任何阴谋。同时，越南人民敦促法国政府和各有关国家严格履行所达成的协议。
    捷“红色权利报”
    “红色权利报”二十五日在国际述评栏中发表评论，表示完全支持中国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言中所表明的中国人民解放台湾的决心。
    评论指出，台湾已经成为美国向中国进行军事挑衅和向其他爱好和平的国家进行海盗式袭击的主要基地。不能够再在印度支那使用的美国武器正在被运往台湾。同时，蒋介石集团奉美帝国主义者的命令，正在为这种挑衅行动准备炮灰。全世界爱好和平的人民对于美国的这种在远东煽动另一次战争的无耻的和露骨的行动深为愤慨。
    评论接着指出，“把台湾交还给中国是符合全世界爱好和平的人民的利益的。中国人民希望在互相尊重领土完整和主权的基础上和所有的国家和平相处。他们无意向其他任何国家发动侵略，但是也不容许别人向他们发动任何侵略。他们只是要求一向是属于中国的台湾岛。解放台湾完全是中国人民的内政，中国人民决不容许外国进行任何干涉。”
