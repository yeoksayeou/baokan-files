    Anshan, the steel capital, recently held its first Youth Congress. More than 550 representatives of the city's 130,000 young people from all walks of life enthusiastically discussed the report made by Cui Qiming, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Anshan Democratic Youth Federation, entitled "Study Hard, Work Hard, Build Anshan Iron and Steel, and Advance Towards Socialism!" After elections, the "Anshan Democratic Youth Federation" was formally established.
    Through this conference, each representative clearly recognized the future tasks of the youth of Anshan. Liu Zuwei, Anshan Iron and Steel's special-class labor model and assistant engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel Power Plant, who attended the conference, stated at the conference that he and other young technical personnel representatives would actively convey the conference's resolutions after returning, and work with everyone to carry out creative labor with a spirit of innovation, humbly learn advanced experience, and promote the innovation movement. He said, "The success of our work is directly related to the country's construction and the growth of peace forces. If I can ensure safe power supply in my position, I can ensure that other comrades produce more steel." Yu Baogang, a young technician from the initial rolling mill, said: We must further improve the rapid steel rolling method. Recently, we have implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, and the transformation of the continuous rolling mill has achieved initial success. After returning this time, we must continue to study technology and improve the output and quality of steel on the original basis. The youth representatives in other work posts also unanimously stated that they would work with the vast number of young people to strengthen the concept of labor, accept every specific task in socialist construction assigned to them by the motherland with peace of mind, and give greater play to their initiative and creativity in their positions to ensure the victorious completion of the Anshan Iron and Steel production and construction tasks. The representatives also proposed in the discussion that the Anshan Democratic Youth Federation should organize the city's youth to participate in voluntary labor to beautify the city and strengthen the political and ideological education of the youth.
    Finally, the conference adopted resolutions on strengthening the study and publicity of the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and wrote to the Beijing Conference of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council to be held soon in Beijing, expressing a warm welcome to the international youth friends who will visit our country.
