    On the Basis of the Development of the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement,
    More Than 100,000 New Agricultural Implements Were Promoted in Various Places in the First Half of the Year
    This year's work of promoting new agricultural implements in the first half of the year has been further developed with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. According to incomplete statistics from agricultural departments in various regions, more than 76,000 new agricultural implements of various types were promoted in the first half of the year. Including the part supplied by the self-operated part of the supply and marketing cooperative departments in various places, the total number is more than 100,000. These new agricultural implements include: double-wheeled double-share plows, double-wheeled single-share plows, three-tooth light weeding hoes, harvesters, seeders, etc.
    In the first half of this year, various regions paid more attention to imparting the technology of using new agricultural implements in the work of promoting new agricultural implements. In the past six months, supply and marketing cooperative departments in Shandong, former western Liaoning, Shanxi, and Henan provinces have trained more than 118,000 technicians. According to incomplete statistics from Ningxia, Sichuan, and Xikang provinces, more than 3,600 technicians who use new agricultural implements have been trained. Jiangsu, Hebei, Shanxi and other places have also trained drivers of horse-drawn agricultural implements. The widespread imparting of the technology of using new agricultural implements has played a certain role in promoting the work of new agricultural implements. The number of step plows used in provinces in the Northwest region has increased from 60% last year to more than 80%. Due to the development of technology going to the countryside in Ningxia Province, the step plows used in the fields in spring and summer this year account for about 90% of the total promotion in the province.
    In the first half of this year, Shanxi, Hebei, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, Qinghai, Ningxia and other provinces established 53 new-style animal-powered agricultural implement stations and 16 experimental points. These stations and points are equipped with more than 500 new-style animal-powered agricultural implements. After these stations were established, they successively began to rent out new-style animal-powered agricultural implements and provide farmers with farming services using new-style animal-powered agricultural implements. Farmers in the areas surrounding the agricultural implement stations realized the superiority of the new agricultural implements and demanded to rent and buy them one after another.
    The vast majority of the original 664 agricultural technology promotion stations in the Northeast region that focused on promoting new agricultural implements expanded their business scope in the first half of the year. For example, the Yiliba Station in Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, focused on guiding four villages and sixteen sets of new-style animal-powered agricultural implements last year, and expanded to seven villages and thirty sets of agricultural implements this year.
    Many regions are preparing to further develop this work in the important season of promoting new agricultural implements after the autumn harvest and before the ground freezes. Henan Province is preparing to complete this year's new agricultural implement promotion task before the autumn plowing this year. At the same time, it is also preparing to conduct a general survey of the new agricultural implements that have been promoted, and combine the survey with technical instruction, repair and other work, so that the step plows that have been promoted can give full play to their role in autumn plowing. In order to promote new agricultural implements to farmers in the autumn plowing season, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Xikang Province has distributed 450 seven-inch step plows to various counties in Ya'an and Xichang Prefectures. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the promotion of new agricultural implements after autumn, the province also held a training class for new-style agricultural implement cadres in late June to learn the use and assembly technology of new-style step plows and other agricultural implements. In order to give play to the role of new agricultural implements and do a good job in this year's autumn plowing, all grassroots promotion stations in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province have trained more than 1,000 farmer technicians since late July, focusing on teaching the technology of using new-style plows and harrows. At the same time, it is preparing to generally repair the new agricultural implements used for autumn plowing before autumn plowing. (Zhao Jinyu)

    在互助合作运动发展的基础上
    各地上半年推广新农具十万多件
    今年上半年的新式农具推广工作，随着互助合作运动的发展有了进一步的开展。据各地农业部门不完全的统计，上半年共推广各种新农具七万六千多件。连同各地供销合作部门自营部分供应的计算在内，总数有十万余件。这些新农具包括：双轮双铧犁、双轮一铧犁、三齿轻便耘锄、收割机、播种机等。
    今年上半年各地在推广新农具工作中多注意了使用技术的传授。山东、原辽西、山西、河南等省的供销合作部门半年来就训练了技术人员十一万八千多人。据宁夏、四川、西康等省不完全的统计，训练了三千六百多个使用新式农具的技术手。江苏、河北、山西等地还训练了马拉农具的驾驶手。由于普遍传授使用新农具的技术，对推广新农具工作起了一定的作用。西北区各省步犁的使用数，已从去年的百分之六十提高到百分之八十以上。宁夏省由于开展技术下乡工作，今年春夏两季下地的步犁，占全省推广总数的百分之九十左右。
    今年上半年山西、河北、陕西、内蒙古、甘肃、江苏、江西、安徽、河南、青海、宁夏等省建立了新式畜力农具站五十三处和试验点十六个。这些站、点共配备有新式畜力农具五百多件。这些站在建立后都相继开始出租新式畜力农具和以新式畜力农具为农民代耕的业务。农具站周围地区农民认识到新农具的优越性，纷纷要求租用和购买。
    东北区原有的六百六十四个以推广新农具为主的农业技术推广站，绝大多数在上半年都扩大了业务范围。如黑龙江省龙江县依力巴站，去年重点指导四个村、十六套新式畜力农具，今年扩大到七个村、三十套农具。
    许多地区都准备在秋收后结冻前的推广新农具的重要季节中进一步开展这一工作。河南省准备在今年秋耕前全部完成今年新农具推广任务。同时准备对已推广下去的新农具进行一次普查，并结合普查进行技术传授、修配等工作，使已推广下去的步犁在秋耕中充分发挥作用。西康省农林厅为了在秋耕季节向农民推广新农具，已把四百五十部七吋步犁分配给雅安、西昌专区各县。该省为使秋后推广新农具工作顺利进行，还在六月下旬举办新式农具干部训练班，学习新式步犁等农具的使用和装配技术。黑龙江省克山县为了发挥新农具作用和做好今年的秋翻工作，全县各基层推广站从七月下旬起训练农民技术手一千多名，重点传授使用新式犁、耙的技术。同时准备在秋翻地前普遍检修好秋耕用的新农具。　（赵近宇）
