　　Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: The United States authorities are stepping up the expansion of Chiang Kai-shek bandit's naval and air forces, attempting to strengthen their aggressive actions against our country.

　　U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Partridge will lead a group of senior officers to Taiwan on August 14th to plan the expansion of Chiang Kai-shek's air force. According to the Pan-Asia News Agency, which has close ties with the Chiang Kai-shek gang, the U.S. authorities sent Partridge to Taiwan to explain that they have decided to "give full support" to the development of Taiwan's air force. Recently, the U.S. First Fleet Commander Phillips and Seventh Fleet Commander Pride, who directed armed provocations against our country along the coast of Hainan Island, will also go to Taiwan in August to carry out conspiratorial activities. U.S. Seventh Fleet Task Force 72 Commander Kiewitt arrived in Taiwan first on the 8th. According to the Chiang Kai-shek gang's news agency and newspapers, Phillips and Pride will hold secret talks with Chiang Kai-shek after arriving in Taiwan to plan the strengthening of Chiang Kai-shek's naval forces and to formulate a plan to use U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek naval forces to blockade our coast. At the same time, the U.S. authorities dispatched Navy Colonel Burch to Taiwan on August 6th to replace Army Colonel Jenner, Chief of Staff of the U.S. military "aid" advisory group stationed in Taiwan. Agence France-Presse said that this personnel change confirms that the U.S. military "aid" advisory group will "focus more on expanding Taiwan's navy" in order to strengthen Chiang Kai-shek's offensive forces. There are reports that the United States will send more naval officers to replace the army officers in the military "aid" advisory group in the future.

　　According to Western news agencies, the first batch of F-86 Sabre jet fighters supplied by the United States to Chiang Kai-shek will be shipped to Taiwan before August 14th, and two other batches will be shipped to Taiwan in the near future. The two destroyers supplied by the United States to Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Taiwan on August 4th. Prior to this, the United States had transferred three landing crafts and three patrol boats to Chiang Kai-shek. According to Reuters, Miller, deputy chief of the Navy Section of the U.S. military "aid" advisory group stationed in Taiwan, said on the 8th that the United States will transfer more warships to Chiang Kai-shek in the future.

　　In order to accelerate the realization of the conspiracy to expand the Chiang Kai-shek army, the U.S. authorities are preparing to substantially increase military "aid" to Chiang Kai-shek. According to Chiang Kai-shek gang newspapers, the U.S. authorities have planned to give Chiang Kai-shek 650 million U.S. dollars in military "aid" and economic "aid" in the 1954-1955 fiscal year. It is estimated that the U.S. authorities gave Chiang Kai-shek more than 530 million U.S. dollars in military "aid" and economic "aid" in the 1953-1954 fiscal year. According to the Chiang Kai-shek gang news agency, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford recently stated at a closed-door meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee that after the armistice in Indochina, Taiwan has "greater importance" in the U.S. policy of aggression against China and Asia. He also said that the United States should give Chiang Kai-shek more military "aid," and that this "aid" to Chiang Kai-shek is "completely worthwhile."

　　美国加紧扩充蒋匪海空军企图加紧侵略活动
    【新华社十日讯】美国当局正在加紧扩充蒋匪海空军力量，企图加强对我国的侵略行动。
    美国远东空军司令帕特里奇将在八月十四日率领一批高级军官到台湾去，策划扩充蒋匪的空军力量。据和蒋匪帮有密切关系的泛亚社透露，美国当局派遣帕特里奇到台湾去说明，它已经决定对台湾空军的发展“给予全力的支持”。最近在海南岛沿海指挥对我国进行武装挑衅的美国第一舰队司令菲利普斯和第七舰队司令普赖德也将在八月份内到台湾去进行阴谋活动。美国第七舰队第七十二特遣舰队司令基维特已在八日首先到达台湾。据蒋匪帮的通讯社和报纸透露，菲利普斯和普赖德到台湾后将和蒋匪进行秘密会谈，策划加强蒋匪海军力量，并且拟订一项使用美国和蒋匪海军力量对我国海岸进行封锁的计划。同时，美国当局已在八月六日派遣了海军上校伯奇到台湾去，接替驻台湾的美国军事“援助”顾问团参谋长陆军上校詹内的职位。法新社说，这次人员的更换证实，美国军事“援助”顾问团为了加强蒋匪的进攻力量，将“更多地着重扩建台湾的海军”。有消息说，美国在今后将派遣更多的海军军官去接替军事“援助”顾问团中的陆军军官。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国供给蒋匪的第一批F—八十六型佩刀式喷气机将在八月十四日以前运到台湾，另外两批也将在最近运到台湾去。美国供给蒋匪的两艘驱逐舰已在八月四日到达台湾。在这以前，美国已移交给蒋匪三艘登陆艇，三艘巡逻艇。据路透社报道，驻台湾的美国军事“援助”顾问团海军科副科长米勒在八日表示，美国在今后还要把更多的军舰移交给蒋匪。
    为了加紧实现扩充蒋匪军的阴谋，美国当局正在准备大量增加对蒋匪的军事“援助”。据蒋匪帮报纸透露，美国当局已计划在一九五四到一九五五年度内给予蒋匪六亿五千万美元的军事“援助”和经济“援助”。而据估计，美国当局在一九五三到一九五四年度内给予了蒋匪五亿三千多万美元的军事“援助”和经济“援助”。据蒋匪帮通讯社透露，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福最近曾在参议院拨款委员会的秘密会议上特别表示，在印度支那停战以后，台湾在美国侵略中国和亚洲的政策中具有“更大的重要性”。他还表示，美国应给予蒋匪更多的军事“援助”，对蒋匪的这种“援助”是“完全值得”的。
