(Xinhua News Agency, August 5th) Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China sent a reply telegram to Indian Prime Minister Nehru, thanking him for his congratulations on the signing of the Indochina armistice agreement. The text of the telegram is as follows:
To His Excellency Prime Minister Nehru of the Republic of India:
    I was honored to receive your telegram upon my return to Beijing. Thank you for your congratulations to the Chinese government and to me.
    The agreements reached at the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina are the result of the joint efforts of peace-loving countries and people around the world. Here, I would like to point out that you not only expressed the desire to stop the war in Indochina long before the start of the Geneva Conference, but you also worked with other Prime Ministers of the Colombo Conference countries to promote the progress of the Geneva Conference. During the Geneva Conference, you also appointed Mr. Menon to go to Geneva to provide valuable assistance to our work. Your efforts have undoubtedly been an important factor in promoting the success of the Geneva Conference. Please allow me to congratulate Your Excellency and your government equally for the achievements of the Geneva Conference.
    Now, peace in Indochina is about to be restored, which will help establish and expand a peaceful region in Southeast Asia. Dear Prime Minister, I would like to express that in the great cause of continuing to work to consolidate peace in Asia and the world, the People's Republic of China will cooperate closely with the Republic of India and all countries in the world that desire peace.
