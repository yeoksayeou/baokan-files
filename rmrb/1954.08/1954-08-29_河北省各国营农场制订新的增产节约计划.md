    Hebei Province's more than 160 state-owned farms are actively formulating new "increase income, reduce expenditure" production increase and thrift plans to ensure over-fulfillment of the annual production increase plan. The newly formulated production plans are mostly higher than the original plans. The cotton yield of farms in Handan Prefecture was originally planned to be 373 jin per mu, but now it has been increased to 390 jin per mu; corn production has increased by 10% compared to the original plan. The total output of all crops has increased by 7% compared to the original plan. The state-owned Hangu Mechanical Farm originally planned to produce 550 jin of rice per mu, but now it has been increased to 572.9 jin, and the farm's more than 8,900 mu of rice can increase production by more than 200,000 jin. According to preliminary statistics from five mechanical farms, six prefectural farms, one orchard, one municipal farm, and one county farm, from now until the end of the year, the planned increase in production is equivalent to more than 2.3 billion yuan.
    In order to ensure the realization of the over-production plan, all farms have generally strengthened the later-stage management of crops, and have generally cultivated four or five times. Laiyuan County Farm has applied fast-acting fertilizer to some of the more severely damaged crops. Xingtai Prefecture Farm has promptly pruned and removed side shoots according to the cotton growth and soil fertility conditions. At present, the flowers have bloomed to the top, and eight bolls have formed, with the most reaching eleven. The 170 mu with the best growth can produce an average of 370 jin per mu. The state-owned Hangu Mechanical Farm proposed in its production increase measures that harvesting should be done quickly, threshing should be done quickly, and warehousing should be done quickly, and harvesting and threshing should be clean.

    河北省各国营农场制订新的增产节约计划
    河北省一百六十多个国营农场为保证超额完成全年增产计划，正积极制订新的“增加收入，减少开支”的增产节约计划。新制订出的产量计划大部较原计划提高。邯郸专区农场棉花原计划每亩产三百七十三斤，现提高到三百九十斤；玉米较原计划增产百分之十。全部作物总产量较原计划提高百分之七。国营汉沽机械农场每亩水稻原计划产五百五十斤，现提高到五百七十二点九斤，全场八千九百多亩水稻共可增产二十万多斤。据五个机械农场、六个专区农场、一个果树场、一个市农场、一个县农场的初步统计，自现在到年底，计划增产折合二十三亿多元。
    为保证实现超额增产计划，各农场普遍加强了作物的后期管理，现一般已中耕四、五次。涞源县农场对部分受害较重的作物，特别追施了速效肥。邢台专区农场根据棉花生育情况和地力条件，及时整枝打杈，目前花已开到顶部，成铃已达八个，最多者达十一个，生长最好的一百七十亩，平均每亩可产到三百七十斤。国营汉沽机械农场在增产措施中提出，收割时要求做到快收割、快脱粒、快入库，收割、脱粒要净。　（新华社）
