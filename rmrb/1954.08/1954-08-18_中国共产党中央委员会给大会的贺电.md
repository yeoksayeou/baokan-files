To the Comrades of the First National Congress of the All-China Heavy Industry Union, forwarded by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions:

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China warmly congratulates you on the opening of your congress and wishes the meeting a complete success. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, all workers, engineering and technical personnel, and staff members in the heavy industry sector, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, have used creative labor to restore and develop China's iron and steel industry, non-ferrous metal industry, chemical industry, and building materials industry, and have begun large-scale and technologically advanced capital construction work, which is of great significance to the development of China's industry and national economy. Heavy industry is the foundation of the country's socialist industrialization, and China's heavy industry is currently in a state of weak foundation and low technology. During the period of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, the state will concentrate its main efforts on building and developing heavy industry in order to promote China's socialist construction and socialist transformation. All employees in the heavy industry sector bear arduous and glorious tasks in this regard. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China hopes that through the discussions of this congress and the establishment of the National Committee of the China Heavy Industry Union, all employees in the heavy industry sector will be mobilized and organized to further improve their political awareness, strengthen labor discipline, strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, master new technologies, prevent and overcome complacency, continue to promote the spirit of innovation, actively participate in labor competitions, promote rationalization proposals and technological innovation movements, and strive to successfully complete the state's production plan and capital construction plan!

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    中国共产党中央委员会给大会的贺电中华全国总工会转中国重工业工会第一次全国代表大会的全体同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会热烈祝贺你们的大会开幕，并预祝会议成功。中华人民共和国成立以来，重工业部门的全体工人、工程技术人员和职员，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和全国总工会的领导下，以创造性的劳动恢复和发展了我国的钢铁工业、有色金属工业、化学工业和建筑材料工业，并开始进行了规模巨大、技术先进的基本建设工作，这对于我国工业和国民经济的发展，都有重要的作用。重工业是国家的社会主义工业化的基础，我国重工业目前尚处在基础不强和技术不高的状态。在发展国民经济的第一个五年计划期间，国家将集中主要力量来建设和发展重工业，以推进我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，重工业部门的全体职工在这方面担负着艰巨的和光荣的任务。中国共产党中央委员会希望你们经过这次大会的讨论和中国重工业工会全国委员会的成立，发动和组织重工业部门的全体职工，进一步提高政治觉悟，加强劳动纪律，努力学习苏联先进经验，掌握新的技术，防止和克服骄傲自满情绪，继续发扬创造精神，积极参加劳动竞赛，推进合理化建议和技术革新运动，为胜利完成国家的生产计划和基本建设计划而奋斗！
    中国共产党中央委员会
