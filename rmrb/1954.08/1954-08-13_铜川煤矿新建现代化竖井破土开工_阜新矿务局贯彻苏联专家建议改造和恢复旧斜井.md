    Tongchuan Coal Mine Breaks Ground on New Modern Vertical Shaft
    Fuxin Mining Bureau Implements Soviet Experts' Suggestions to Renovate and Restore Old Inclined Shafts
    The first pair of modern vertical shafts planned to be newly built in the Northwest District this year by Tongchuan Coal Mine broke ground on August 1st. After the completion of these vertical shafts, their annual coal production will be twice the planned coal production of Tongchuan Coal Mine this year. This pair of vertical shafts was designed by the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute of the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry. According to the design, the entire production process of this pair of vertical shafts will be fully mechanized. The worker sitting at the operating console of the coal cutter only needs to press a button, and the coal cutter will automatically rotate and cut down large quantities of coal, which will then be transferred through a series of mechanical conveyances such as chain conveyors and electric locomotives. Nearly 6,000 catties of coal can be hoisted from the bottom of the main shaft to the ground in one minute.
    The workers constructing the vertical shafts are all highly enthusiastic and have expressed their determination to guarantee the completion of the task ahead of schedule. Mason Suo Guangwen, nearly fifty years old, stated that he would actively promote advanced experience to ensure that the vertical shaft project is "good, economical, fast, and safe." Employees transferred from the Northeast all feel very honored to support the construction of mines in the Northwest. Worker Song Xingrang, who has more than 30 years of experience operating cranes, immediately volunteered after hearing the organization's call to work in the Northwest; young worker Wang Baolin joined the team going to the Northwest before his wedding leave was over.

    Fuxin Mining Bureau is implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts to accelerate the renovation and restoration of the North Open-pit Mine and inclined shafts such as Dongsan Pit, Dongsiken Pit, Dongwuken Pit, and Dongliuken Pit of Xinqiu Coal Mine. At present, the renovation projects of the North Open-pit Mine, Dongsan Pit, and Dongsiken Pit are nearing completion. The restoration projects of Dongwuken Pit and Dongliuken Pit, which have been shut down for many years, have completed more than 40 percent of the total project, and the tunneling engineering is also nearing completion, so partial mechanical installation can be carried out soon. After the completion of the renovation and restoration of these mines and their commissioning, they will supply the country with a large amount of industrial coal every year. By the time of the second Five-Year Plan, the coal produced annually by these mines will be equal to the planned output of all the mines of the Fuxin Mining Bureau (including the Haizhou Open-pit Mine) this year.
    These mines currently undergoing renovation and restoration were all mined during the puppet Manchukuo period. Due to the predatory mining by the enemy and puppets, the technology was very backward. Among them, Dongwuken Pit and Dongliuken Pit were severely damaged by the enemy during the Japanese surrender and the Liberation War, and had long ceased production. After liberation, the Fuxin Mining Bureau actively started to restore them. However, the geological conditions in which these mines are located are very complex and belong to the upper coal seam group. Therefore, no decision was made on whether to restore old wells or build new wells for coal mining in these areas. In 1953, Soviet experts conducted practical research and put forward the suggestion of renovating and restoring the original mines. Because, according to the coal reserves that can be mined in these areas, as long as the original mines are renovated and restored, the coal can be mined, and the investment is small and the results are quick. Based on this suggestion from Soviet experts, the Fuxin Mining Bureau started the renovation and restoration projects successively from the end of last year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    铜川煤矿新建现代化竖井破土开工
    阜新矿务局贯彻苏联专家建议改造和恢复旧斜井
    铜川煤矿今年计划新建的西北区第一对现代化竖井，已在八月一日破土开工。这对竖井建成后，它每年的产煤量将等于铜川煤矿今年计划产煤量的两倍。这对竖井是由中央人民政府燃料工业部东北煤矿管理局沈阳煤矿设计院设计的。按照设计，这对竖井的整个生产过程全部是机械化的。坐在截煤机操纵台上的工人，只要一按电钮，截煤机就会自动转动，把大批煤块割落下来，然后通过链板运输机和电机车等一系列机械转运，一分钟就可把近六千市斤的煤炭由主井的井下提升到地面。
    建设竖井的工人热情都很高涨，纷纷表示要保证提前完成任务。近五十岁的瓦工索广文表示要积极推广先进经验，使竖井工程做到“又好又省又快又安全”。从东北调来的职工，对支援西北的矿井建设，都感到很光荣。有着三十多年操纵起重机经验的工人宋兴让，听到组织上号召到西北来工作的消息以后，立即主动的报了名；青年工人王宝林，不等婚假期满，就参加了到西北来的队伍。

    阜新矿务局贯彻苏联专家建议，加紧改造和恢复新邱煤矿的北露天矿和东三坑、东四坑、东五坑、东六坑等斜井。目前，北露天矿、东三坑、东四坑的改造工程已经接近完工，停产多年的东五坑、东六坑的恢复工程已完成了总工程量的百分之四十以上，井筒的发?工程也已经接近完工，不久就可以进行部分机械安装。这些矿井改造、恢复完成并投入生产后，每年将要供给国家大量工业用煤。到第二个五年计划的时候，这些矿井每年生产的煤就可以等于阜新矿务局全部矿井（包括海州露天矿）今年的计划产量。
    正在改造和恢复的这些矿井，都是伪满时期开采的。由于敌伪掠夺式的开采，技术很落后。其中东五坑、东六坑在日本投降时和解放战争中，又遭到了敌人的严重破坏，早已停止生产。解放后，阜新矿务局积极着手恢复。但这些矿井所处地位的地质情况很复杂，又属上层煤群，因此，在这些地方是恢复旧井还是建设新井采煤，没有作出决定。一九五三年，苏联专家经过实际研究以后，提出了改造和恢复原有矿井的建议。因为根据这些地区可能采出的煤藏量，只要改造和恢复原有矿井，就可把煤采出来，而且投资少收效快。阜新矿务局根据苏联专家这一建议，从去年年底起，就先后开始了改造和恢复工程。　（新华社）
