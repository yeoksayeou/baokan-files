Over ten thousand cultural and artistic workers in Shanghai are using various tools and forms to publicize the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China to the city's residents.

Since August, the city's thirty-five cinemas and seventy-eight theaters and storytelling houses have been decorated with a festive atmosphere. Inside and outside the venues, huge banners with red silk and gold lettering publicizing the Draft Constitution are hung; slide shows and short plays, duets, etc., publicizing the Draft Constitution are also being performed. The troupes touring workers' clubs in various factory districts are also using various forms of folk art to perform short programs publicizing the Draft Constitution. At present, the short propaganda materials compiled and directed by various opera genres have reached thirty pieces.

Shanghai's art workers have drawn nearly a hundred propaganda posters and comic strips related to the Draft Constitution. The East China People's Fine Arts Publishing House has published five new types of colored posters with different content, including those explaining the articles of the Draft Constitution and those depicting the enthusiastic situation of the people cheering the Draft Constitution. The first batch of these posters will be distributed in 400,000 copies. Musicians have also created three songs praising the Draft Constitution.

The Shanghai People's Library and the Shanghai Library have successively held the "Exhibition of Main Reference Books and Pictures for Discussing and Publicizing the Draft Constitution." The eleven Shanghai People's Library reading rooms distributed in various districts of the city have also set up special exhibition counters for reference books on the Constitution to facilitate readers' borrowing. Xinhua Bookstore Shanghai Branch has issued 870,000 copies of the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" as a separate publication and 1.81 million copies of reference books and documents related to the Constitution.

In the evening, when the cool breeze dispels the scorching heat left by the sun, the cultural centers located in Cao Yang New Village, Zhongshan Park, and other places are crowded with people watching the slide show "The Draft Constitution is Published," newly released by the business department of the state-owned Shanghai Film Slide Projector Manufacturing Factory. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Museum and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Galleries on Huaihai Middle Road and Changshou Road, like a bright strip of light, constantly attract crowds of visitors with their beautiful pictures related to the Soviet Constitution.

    上海市一万多名文化艺术工作者
    利用各种形式宣传宪法草案
    上海市一万多名文化艺术工作者正在运用各种工具和形式向全市人民进行中华人民共和国宪法草案的宣传。
    八月份以来，全市三十五家电影院和七十八家剧院、书场布置得喜气洋洋。场内场外挂着红绸金字的宣传宪法草案的巨幅标语；并加演着宣传宪法草案的幻灯影片和短剧、对唱等。正在各工厂区的工人俱乐部中巡回演出的剧团，也都利用各种曲艺形式演唱宣传宪法草案的短篇节目。目前，各剧种的编导编写的短编宣传材料已达三十篇。
    上海市的美术工作者绘制了近百幅有关宪法草案的宣传画、连环图画。华东人民美术出版社已出版了五种不同内容的新色招贴画，其中有解释宪法草案的条文的，有描绘全民欢呼宪法草案的热烈情况的。这些招贴画第一批将要发行四十万张。音乐工作者也创作了三首歌颂宪法草案的歌曲。
    上海市人民图书馆和上海图书馆先后举办了“讨论宣传宪法草案主要参考图书图片展览会”。分布在全市各区的十一个上海市人民图书馆阅览室，也都设立了有关宪法参考图书的展览专柜，以便利读者借阅。新华书店上海分店已经发行了八十七万册“中华人民共和国宪法草案”单行本和一百八十一万册有关宪法的参考书籍和文件。
    晚上，当凉风驱散了太阳留下的炎威时，座落在曹杨新村、中山公园等地的文化馆里，又挤满了许多人在看放映国营上海电影幻灯机件制造厂营业所新近发行的“宪法草案公布了”的幻灯片。中苏友谊馆和淮海中路、长寿路上的中苏友好画廊，像一条灿烂的光带，这里展出的一幅幅有关苏联宪法的美丽图片，不断地吸引了参观的人群。
