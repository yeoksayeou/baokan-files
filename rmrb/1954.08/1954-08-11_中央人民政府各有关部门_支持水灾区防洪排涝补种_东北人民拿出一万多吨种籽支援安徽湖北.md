(Reported by this newspaper) Relevant departments of the Central People's Government vigorously support the broad masses in the Yangtze and Huai River basins in their fight against floods and drainage.

Since the beginning of summer this year, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River area have experienced continuous heavy rains, and the water levels of the rivers have continued to rise, with some low-lying areas becoming waterlogged. After the waterlogging occurred, the local Party and government organs immediately led the broad masses in a fierce struggle against the floods. In addition to issuing timely instructions and constantly dispatching cadres, the relevant departments of the Central People's Government also provided strong support in terms of materials. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, together with other departments, allocated more than 300 water pumps (over 8,000 horsepower) in late June to support Wuhan in draining the waterlogged areas. After these water pumps were started, they could drain more than 61,000 tons of waterlogged water per hour. In July, more than 460 water pumps were allocated to Anhui Province and various places along the Huai River. Preparations are now being made to allocate more to assist in solving the waterlogging problem in the safe area of ​​Jingjiang County. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives has allocated more than one million straw bags from the Northeast and other places to support flood control in various places. In addition to supporting Wuhan with more than one million sacks together with the Ministry of Water Resources and other departments, the Ministry of Commerce of the Central Government also transferred more than 5,300 tons of diesel to ensure the operation of water pumps. The Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives also notified grassroots organizations in areas with waterlogging to supply materials in a timely manner, expand the variety of purchases, to ensure the needs of the masses, solve the difficulties of the masses, maintain price stability, and oppose hoarding and refusal to sell and price gouging by speculators. Therefore, since the start of flood prevention in Wuhan, except for a slight shortage of vegetables from time to time, the supply of other materials has been basically guaranteed.

While vigorously preventing floods and draining waterlogged areas, various localities are also actively carrying out replanting and changing crops. Non-disaster areas are working harder to expand the planting and replanting area and strengthen field management of existing crops in an effort to increase production above target. According to preliminary plans of Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Hebei, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces, they will strive to increase grain production by more than 12 billion catties. In order to support the progress of this work, the Central Ministry of Food, together with the Ministry of Agriculture, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and other departments, has allocated more than 42 million catties of late autumn crop seeds to Anhui and Hubei provinces and purchased more than 76 million catties of potato seeds on their behalf. The provinces have also adjusted grain seeds among themselves by about 40 million catties, and have mobilized the masses to exchange and borrow from each other. Therefore, the required seeds have been basically resolved. In addition to stopping the external transfer of grain, the Central Ministry of Food has also appropriately transferred a portion of grain to some disaster-stricken areas in Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, etc., to ensure the people's food needs.

After the start of flood prevention work, the Central Ministry of Health instructed all localities to organize medical cadres and mobilize local doctors to go to construction sites and disaster areas to work. Wuhan has about 1,000 medical personnel serving flood prevention and rescue. Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi and other places also have hundreds of people. The East China region is organizing more than 1,000 medical personnel from Shanghai and other places to rush to the Anhui region to strengthen medical rescue work. The health work team in flood-stricken areas led by Chen Wengui, director of the Health and Epidemic Prevention Department of the Ministry of Health, has left Beijing for Wuhan and the flood-stricken areas of Hubei and Anhui provinces to guide the local health and medical work. This work team is composed of personnel from the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, the General Association of the Red Cross Society of China, the Beijing Medical College, and the Beijing Infectious Disease Hospital, including epidemiologists and disinfection experts. At present, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has organized 50 graduating students from this year's Beijing Medical College and 20 medical personnel from the directly affiliated hospitals of the Health Department of the directly affiliated organs of the Ministry of Health to go to the flood-stricken areas of Anhui Province to work. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has also instructed the Health Bureau of the Northwest Administrative Committee and the Health Bureau of the Southwest Administrative Committee to organize 40 to 50 experienced physicians and inspectors to go to the flood-stricken areas of Anhui and Hubei provinces to participate in health work. In addition, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government allocated a large number of biological products for disease prevention and medical supplies for disinfection to the flood-stricken areas, which had already been delivered to the disaster-stricken areas by three special planes. Another 10 billion yuan has been allocated to the flood-stricken areas such as Hubei Province as funds for free treatment.

In order to keep abreast of the disaster situation and disaster relief work in various places, the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Central Government established a contact system with the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui from the very beginning when the water situation became tense, and successively sent four work groups to the areas with more serious disasters to understand the situation and help with work. Through the office of the Central Production and Disaster Relief Committee, we are in constant contact with the relevant departments of the Central Government to solve various specific problems that the provinces have requested the Central Government to solve. Since the end of June, the ministry has successively allocated more than 450 billion yuan in relief funds to help disaster-stricken people solve their living difficulties and restore production.

With the strong leadership and support of the Central Government, the flood control struggle in various places has achieved great victories, and they are currently working hard to continue to overcome the floods.

(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th) The people of Northeast China have taken out more than 10,000 tons of late autumn crop seeds to support the peasant brothers in Anhui and Hubei provinces who have suffered from floods, and to help them rush to plant late autumn crops after the floods recede. The first batch of more than 9,400 tons of buckwheat, mung beans, millet, broomcorn millet, foxtail millet and other late autumn crop seeds transported to Bengbu, Guzhen, and Suxian in Anhui Province, and Guangshui and Qijiawan in Hubei Province, began to be shipped from more than 70 railway stations in Northeast China on August 3, and 54 percent had been shipped by August 6. It is expected that all of them will be shipped by the 10th. The second batch of more than 500 tons of buckwheat seeds shipped to Guangshui, Hubei Province, also began to depart from various railway stations on the 8th, and it is planned that all of them will be shipped by the 13th. In addition, the Liaoning Provincial Cooperative Federation is also shipping 12 million catties of potato seeds purchased for farmers in the disaster-stricken areas of Anhui Province. These late autumn crop seeds are of excellent quality and can ensure emergence.

The people of Northeast China attach great importance to supporting the people in disaster areas to rush to plant late autumn crops, fully demonstrating their concern and sympathy for the people in disaster areas. After receiving requests from the people in the disaster areas of Anhui and Hubei provinces for assistance with late autumn crop seeds, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Northeast Administrative Committee immediately issued a special urgent telegram, instructing relevant departments to use all their strength to complete this serious political task in the shortest possible time. In order to quickly transport the late autumn crop seeds scattered in various grain depots to the railway line, the local grain departments mobilized sufficient transportation vehicles. Many staff members voluntarily cancelled their holidays and worked day and night to complete the transfer task ahead of schedule. The people of Rehe Province are very enthusiastic about supporting the people in disaster areas. In rainy weather, when the roads were muddy and transportation was inconvenient, they used large carts, donkey carts, and small ox carts for transportation. On roads where large carts, donkey carts, and small ox carts could not travel, they used donkeys to carry them. In this way, they finally transported more than 1,800 tons of buckwheat seeds to the railway line ahead of schedule. Now, this batch of buckwheat seeds has also been transported by train from Rehe to the disaster area.

Under the principle of putting disaster relief first, the railway departments in various places have given strong support to this transportation task. They have successively allocated hundreds of wagons to ensure that they are transported as soon as they arrive.

    支持水灾区防洪排涝补种
    东北人民拿出一万多吨种籽支援安徽湖北
    【本报讯】中央人民政府各有关部门大力支持长江、淮河流域广大群众的防洪排涝斗争。
    今年入夏以来，长江中、下游和沿淮地带连降暴雨，江河水位不断上涨，并有部分低洼地区渍水成灾。水涝情况发生后，各地党政机关立即领导广大群众与洪水展开激烈斗争，中央人民政府各有关部门除及时发出指示和不断派出干部外，在物资方面也给予大力支持。中央人民政府水利部会同其他部门在六月下旬调拨三百多部抽水机（八千多马力），支持武汉市排除渍水。这些抽水机开动后，每小时可排出渍水六万一千多吨。七月间，又分别拨给安徽省和沿淮各地抽水机四百六十多部，现正准备再拨一部分协助解决荆江县安全区的渍水问题。中华全国合作总社在东北等地调拨了一百多万条草袋，支援各地防洪。中央商业部除会同水利部等部门支援武汉麻袋一百多万条外，并调去柴油五千三百多吨，保证了抽水机的开动。商业部和合作总社并通知各有水涝情况地区的基层组织，及时供应物资、扩大收购品种，以保证群众需要，解决群众困难，并保持物价稳定，反对投机商人的囤积拒售与压价收购。因此，武汉市自防汛开始以来，除蔬菜间或稍感不足外，其他物资都基本上保证了供应。
    各地在大力防洪排涝的同时，还积极进行补种、改种。非灾区更努力扩大种植和复种面积，加强现有作物的田间管理，争取超额增产。据湖南、湖北、河南、河北、安徽、江苏等省的初步计划，将争取增产粮食一百二十余亿斤。为了支持这一工作的进行，中央粮食部会同农业部、合作总社等部门已拨给安徽、湖北两省晚秋作物种籽四千二百多万斤，代购马铃薯种七千六百多万斤。各省也互相调剂谷种约四千多万斤，并发动群众互换互借，因此，所需种籽已基本解决。中央粮食部对湖北、湖南、安徽、江苏等部分受灾地区，除停止粮食外调外，并适当调入一部分，保证了人民群众的食粮需要。
    中央卫生部在防汛工作开始后，便指示各地组织医疗干部、动员地方医生，赴工地和灾区进行工作。武汉市已约有一千多医务人员为防洪、抢险服务；湖北、安徽、江西等地也都有数百人不等；华东区正从上海等地组织医务人员一千多人，赶赴安徽地区加强医务救护工作。由卫生部卫生防疫司司长陈文贵率领的水患地区卫生工作组已从北京赴武汉市和湖北省、安徽省的水患地区，指导当地的卫生医疗工作。这个工作组由中央人民政府卫生部、中央爱国卫生运动委员会、中国红十字会总会、北京医学院以及北京市传染病医院等单位的人员组成，其中有流行病学专家和消毒专家。目前中央人民政府卫生部又组织了北京医学院本届结业生五十人以及卫生部直属机关卫生处所属各直属医院的医务人员二十人，赶赴安徽省水患地区工作。中央人民政府卫生部并责成西北行政委员会卫生局和西南行政委员会卫生局各组织有经验的医师和检验人员四十到五十人，分赴安徽和湖北两省水患地区参加卫生工作。此外，中央人民政府卫生部拨给水患地区大批预防疾病用的生物制品和消毒用的医药用品，早已由专机三架送达受灾地区；另又拨给湖北省等水患地区一百亿元，作为免费治疗的经费。
    中央内务部为了及时掌握各地的灾情与救灾工作，从水情一开始紧张时便和江淮各省建立了联系制度，并先后派出四个工作组到灾情较重地区了解情况、帮助工作。通过中央生产救灾委员会办公室与中央各有关部门随时接洽，解决各省要求中央解决的各项具体问题。从六月底以来，该部已陆续拨出救济款四千五百多亿元，帮助受灾群众解决生活困难与恢复生产。
    各地防洪斗争在中央大力领导和支持下，已获得很大胜利，目前正为战胜洪水继续努力。
    【新华社沈阳十日电】东北人民拿出万余吨晚秋作物种籽支援安徽、湖北两省遭受水灾的农民兄弟，帮助他们在洪水退后抢种晚秋作物。第一批运往安徽省蚌埠、固镇、宿县和湖北省广水、祁家湾等地的九千四百多吨荞麦、小豆、糜子、稷子、谷子等晚秋作物种籽，已在八月三日起陆续从东北各地七十多个火车站启运，到八月六日止已运出百分之五十四，预计十日可全部运完。第二批运往湖北省广水的五百多吨荞麦种籽也在八日开始从各火车站陆续发车，计划在十三日前全部运完。此外，辽宁省合作社联合社为安徽省灾区农民收购的一千二百万斤土豆种籽，目前亦正陆续运出。这些晚秋作物种籽质量优良，都能保证出苗。
    东北各地人民对支援灾区人民抢种晚秋作物的工作十分重视，充分表现了对灾区人民的关怀和同情。中共中央东北局和东北行政委员会财政经济委员会在接到安徽、湖北两省灾区人民请求援助晚秋作物种籽后，立即发出特急电报，指示有关部门要用全部力量，在最短的时间内完成这一严重的政治任务。各地粮食部门为了把分散在各粮栈的晚秋作物种籽迅速运到铁路沿线，动员了足够的运输工具，许多工作人员自动取消假日，昼夜工作，提前完成了调运任务。热河省人民对灾区人民的支援热情很高。在阴雨天气道路泥泞、交通不便的情况下，他们就用大车、驴车、小牛车运输，在大车、驴车、小牛车也不能行走的道路上，他们就用驴驮。这样，终于提前将一千八百多吨荞麦种籽运到铁路沿线。现在这批荞麦种籽也已全部用火车从热河境内运往灾区。
    在救灾第一的原则下，各地铁道部门对这一运输任务给予大力支持，他们先后共调拨了数百个车皮，保证了随到随运。
