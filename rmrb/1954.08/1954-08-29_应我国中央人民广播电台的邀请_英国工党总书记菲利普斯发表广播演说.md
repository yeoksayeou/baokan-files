Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: Mr. Morgan Phillips, General Secretary of the British Labour Party and member of the British Labour Party delegation currently visiting China, delivered a radio speech at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station before leaving Beijing. The full text of Mr. Phillips' radio speech is as follows:

    I am very pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words to the Chinese people at the invitation of Radio Beijing. This gives me the opportunity to express the gratitude and appreciation of my colleagues and myself for your warm hospitality. This is the first visit to your country for all of us. Of course, we hope this will not be the last. In the short time since we arrived here, we have all been deeply impressed by your friendly attitude. Naturally, our visit is only halfway through at the moment. Beijing is a city where we could spend a lot of time sightseeing. You have the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, the Summer Palace, all of which demonstrate the ancient Chinese craftsmanship, art, and culture. But in visits like ours, while we are eager to see these things and appreciate some of your rich heritage, our main purpose is to see some of the problems of the new China and the work it is doing. We have come to the conclusion that you, like the British people, are eager to live in peace so that you have ample opportunity to develop your country's vast resources for the benefit of the people, raise their living standards, and ensure that every citizen has some degree of security in life, and we believe that such security is something that all mankind should enjoy. Therefore, you must be focused on construction work rather than destruction work. We now know something about the disaster that the world would suffer if a third world war were to break out. But I don't think we know the most brutal situation yet. Mankind is using their energy and talent to seek a new tool of war. For your sake and mine, we should try to use human skills, experience, and talent to obtain the highest standard of living for all mankind. Therefore, we must do our best to understand each other's perspectives, and to understand, promote, and realize each other's legitimate desires. How can we understand each other better? This is a question that perplexes ordinary people all over the world. I believe that one way to achieve this goal is through visits like ours, meeting you in your homes, factories, mines, and manufacturing plants. This gives us the opportunity to see your problems firsthand, and perhaps more importantly, provides us with the opportunity to exchange ideas. We may often have disagreements when dealing with our common problems, and in fact, we certainly will. But even in every family, there are disagreements. The important thing is that when dealing with these issues, especially when there are disagreements, we should maintain a friendly and constructive spirit. In this way, we can all benefit from the exchange of ideas and experiences. It is important that we work together to build genuine friendship between the people of our two countries. This should be the case not only between the people of our two countries, but also between the people of all countries in the world. If there is any hope of permanently maintaining world peace, then that hope must be based on friendship, understanding, and cooperation, and on a willingness to concede to each other on those things that we believe are right and that are in the common interest of all mankind.

    应我国中央人民广播电台的邀请
    英国工党总书记菲利普斯发表广播演说
    【新华社二十八日讯】现在我国访问的英国工党代表团团员、英国工党总书记摩·菲利普斯先生，在离开北京前应中央人民广播电台的邀请，发表广播演说。菲利普斯先生的广播演说词全文如下：
    我非常高兴能够应北京电台的邀请对中国人民说几句话。这使我有机会表达我的同僚们和我本人对你们盛情招待的谢意和感激。我们全体都是第一次访问你们的国家。当然，我们希望这不是最后一次。在我们到这里以后的短短时间里，你们的友好态度使我们都有深刻的印象。自然，目前我们的访问还只进行了一半。北京是一个我们可以花许多时间来观光的城市。你们有紫禁城、天坛、颐和园，这一切都表现出中国古代的工艺、艺术和文化。但是在像我们这样的访问中，虽然我们渴望看这些东西，并欣赏一些你们的丰富遗产，但是我们的主要目的是想看到一些新中国的问题和它所进行的工作。我们得到了这样的结论：你们跟英国人民一样，都渴望和平地生活，以便有充分的机会为了人民的利益而开发你们国家的广大资源，提高他们的生活水平和保证每个公民都能在生活上得到某种程度的保障，而我们相信这样的保障是全人类所应享有的。因此，你们一定是着重于建设的工作而不是破坏的工作。如果第三次世界大战竟然爆发，世界将会遭受怎样的灾难，我们现在都知道了一些。可是我认为我们还不知道最惨酷的情况。人类正在用他们的精力和才智来寻求一种新的战争工具。为了你我的利益，我们应该设法使人类的技能、经验和才智用于为全人类获取最高的生活水平。因此，我们必须尽我们所能来了解相互的观点，并且来体谅、促进和实现各自的正当愿望。我们怎样才能互相更加了解呢？这是世界各地一般的人感到困惑的一个问题。我相信，达到这个目的的一种方法就是通过像我们这样的人的访问，到你们的家庭、工厂、矿山、制造厂与你们见面。这就使我们获得机会亲自看到你们的问题，而且也许更重要的是为我们提供了交换意见的机会。我们在处理我们的共同问题时可能常常会有分歧，而且事实上也是肯定会有的。但是，即使在每个家庭里也是有分歧的。重要的是，我们在处理这些问题时，特别是存在有分歧时，应该抱有一种友好的和建设性的精神。这样，我们就都能够从思想交流和经验交流中获得益处。重要的是我们应该为建立我们两国人民之间的真正友谊而协同努力。不仅我们两国人民之间应该如此，全世界各国人民之间也应该如此。如果永久维持世界和平是有希望的话，那么这种希望就必须是基于友谊、了解和合作以及对于那些我们相信是正当的并且是符合全人类共同利益的事情彼此愿意让步。
