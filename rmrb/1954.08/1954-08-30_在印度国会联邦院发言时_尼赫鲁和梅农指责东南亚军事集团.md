Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 29th: According to the Indian News Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru spoke about the Southeast Asia Group issue in the Council of States of the Indian Parliament on the 27th. Prime Minister Nehru said, "The provisions in the (United Nations) Charter that grant us certain regional organizations are difficult to apply to this kind of organization that has already been formed, whether it is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or whether it is the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. ...It is strange that this is a treaty by which certain countries help other countries protect other countries. This is very strange. It is quite a novel idea for two countries to discuss together what they will do to a third or fourth country.” Nehru also said that the idea that some countries agree to protect other countries regardless of whether those other countries want protection is an old idea that has persisted until World War I.

Nehru said that one of the basic things of the Geneva Conference is that these Indochinese countries should maintain neutrality, which is extremely important. "Now, if anything is done that affects that basic position of Indochina as a neutral area, the whole idea supporting the Geneva Conference decisions will be shaken. ...That would shake the foundation of the agreement to some extent, not only psychologically but also practically.”

Indian representative to the United Nations, Menon, also spoke about the Southeast Asia Group issue in the Council of States of the Indian Parliament on the same day. Menon said, "No matter how fanciful extensions or interpretations are made to the United Nations Charter, this Southeast Asia Treaty Organization cannot comply with the provisions of the United Nations Charter." Menon said that the United Nations Charter stipulates the establishment of regional organizations, "but this (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) is not a regional organization, but an organization by which some people want to protect this region. It is a modern version of the protectorate system. It is an organization by which some imperial countries and some other countries that may be interested in joining want to protect regions that they say are in danger. We are part of this region, and we say we don't want anyone to protect us. According to the United Nations Charter, this kind of union has no place as a regional organization.”

Menon went on to say, "Reversing the process of reconciliation or the easing of tensions that has probably occurred since the Indochina Conference is a diplomatic and political tragedy." "The fact that the Southeast Asian countries—except for Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines—will not participate in this (Southeast Asia Treaty) conference demonstrates its nature to the world. We have no malice toward any of these countries, whether Asian or European, but at the same time, we have a compelling responsibility to declare our opposition to any attempt to establish any kind of military alliance.”

Menon also said that the three countries of Indochina have entered the realm of what can be called the concept of collective peace. The basis of the Geneva Agreement is that other countries should respect the territorial integrity of each of these countries. The three countries of Indochina cannot conclude military alliances with other countries or accept military assistance beyond what is stipulated in the Geneva Agreement.

### 在印度国会联邦院发言时  尼赫鲁和梅农指责东南亚军事集团

    在印度国会联邦院发言时
    尼赫鲁和梅农指责东南亚军事集团
    【新华社二十九日讯】据印度新闻处新德里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁二十七日在印度国会联邦院发言时谈到东南亚集团问题。尼赫鲁总理说：“（联合国）宪章中给予我们的某种区域组织的规定很难应用到这种已经形成的组织身上，不论这是北大西洋公约组织或不论它是东南亚公约组织。……奇怪的是，这是由某些国家帮助其他国家保护其他国家的条约。这是非常奇怪的。两个国家在一起讨论它们将对第三个国家或第四个国家做些什么事，这是相当新奇的观念。”尼赫鲁又说：一些国家不管其他国家要不要保护而同意保护其他国家的那种观念，是一直保持到第一次世界大战时的老观念。
    尼赫鲁说：日内瓦会议的基本东西之一是这些印度支那国家应当保持中立，这是极度重要的东西。“现在，如果做出影响印度支那作为中立地区的那个基本立场的任何事来，支持日内瓦会议决定的整个观念就将动摇。……那就不但在心理上，而且在实际上在某种程度上动摇了协定的基础。”
    印度驻联合国代表梅农同日也在印度国会联邦院的发言中谈到东南亚集团问题。梅农说，“不论对联合国宪章加以怎样想入非非的引伸或解释，这个东南亚公约组织都不能合乎联合国宪章的规定”。梅农说，联合国宪章规定成立区域性组织，“但是这
  （东南亚公约组织）并不是一个区域性组织，而是一个某些人要保护这个地区的组织。它是保护制度的现代版。这是一个某些帝国国家和某些可能有兴趣参加进去的其他国家要保护据它们说是处在危险中的地区的组织。我们是这个地区的一部分，我们说我们不要人家来保护。根据联合国宪章，这种联合要作为区域性组织是没有地位的。”
    梅农接着说，“把和解的进程或是在印度支那会议后大概已发生的紧张局势的缓和进程倒转过来是外交上和政治上的悲剧。”“东南亚国家——巴基斯坦、泰国和菲律宾除外——将不参加这次（东南亚公约）会议这个事实向世界说明了它的性质。对于这些国家中的任何国家，不论是亚洲国家或欧洲国家，我们都没有任何恶意，但是同时，我们有义不容辞的责任宣布反对任何想建立随便那种军事同盟的尝试。”
    梅农还说，印度支那的三个国家已经进入可以说是集体和平的概念的领域内。日内瓦协议的基础是，别的国家应该尊重这些国家中的每一个国家的领土完整。印度支那三个国家不能和别国缔结军事联盟，或者接受在日内瓦协议规定以外的军事援助。
