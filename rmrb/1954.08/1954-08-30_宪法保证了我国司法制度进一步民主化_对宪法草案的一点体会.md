The democratization is the guarantee for building a socialist society. The draft constitution not only consolidates the democratic rights that our people have won, but also promotes further democratization of our country. The spirit of democracy is the basic spirit of the constitution, and it is manifested in every part of the constitution. This article intends to illustrate how the draft constitution guarantees the further democratization of China's judiciary by discussing the provisions on the establishment and activities of judicial organs in the draft constitution. First, judicial democratization is reflected in the establishment of judicial organs. Section 1 of Chapter 2 of the draft constitution stipulates that the President of the Supreme People's Court shall be elected by the National People's Congress, and the Procurator-General shall also be appointed by the National People's Congress. The National People's Congress has the power to remove them, and their work is supervised by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Section 4 of Chapter 2 stipulates that the presidents of people's courts above the county level shall be elected and removed by the people's congresses at the corresponding level. Article 80 of the draft constitution stipulates that the Supreme People's Court is responsible to and reports its work to the National People's Congress; during the adjournment of the National People's Congress, it is responsible to and reports its work to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Local people's courts at all levels are responsible to and report their work to the people's congresses at the corresponding level. From these provisions, we can see that the Supreme People's Court, local people's courts at all levels, and the procuratorial organs are all established on a democratic basis. Their procuratorial and judicial work is carried out in accordance with the laws and decrees formulated by the National People's Congress, and they must report their work to the People's Congress for review and supervision. This shows that the people's judicial organs truly come from the people, belong to the people, and are responsible to the people. This demonstrates that China's judicial system is moving to a new and higher stage.
Second, judicial democratization is reflected in the people's assessor system implemented by the people's courts. Article 75 of the draft constitution stipulates that people's courts at all levels shall implement the system of people's assessors in hearing cases in accordance with the law.
The people's assessor system is one of the principles of judicial democracy. This principle was put forward by Lenin. Lenin said, "We must judge for ourselves. The people should participate in the work of judgment and state management. ... This is important." (Report on the Revision of the Party Program at the Seventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)) He also said, "The court is precisely the organ that attracts all the poor to participate in state management (because judicial affairs are one of the functions of state management), and the court is the organ of the proletariat and poor peasants" ("The Current Tasks of the Soviet Regime"). According to Lenin's instructions, the Soviet Union implemented the people's assessor system as early as the beginning of its establishment in 1917. In the Soviet Union, people's assessors (or temporary judges) and judges (i.e., permanent judges) have equal powers and are elected in the same procedure. Our country has also begun to implement this system. According to the practice of people's courts in handling cases in various places in recent years, it has been proved that this is a necessary and good system; on the one hand, it can absorb the masses to participate in judicial activities and improve their sense of responsibility as masters of the country; on the other hand, it can strengthen the ties between the people's courts and the people. The Constitution states that "All state organs must rely on the masses of the people, maintain close ties with the masses, listen to their opinions, and accept their supervision." The assessors can serve as a bridge. In recent years, the situation in our country has been: before the Second National Judicial Conference, some places used to adopt the method of temporarily inviting or temporarily selecting people's assessors to participate in the trial of certain cases, and later changed to electing fixed assessors to temporarily participate in the trial of certain cases; now some places have elected fixed assessors to participate in the trial of cases on a fixed rotation basis, and the assessors and judges have the same rights and obligations, which reflects that the people's assessor system in our country belongs to the socialist type of assessor system, and its form has become more complete.
Regarding the people's assessor system, it was stipulated in the "Provisional Organizational Regulations of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China" promulgated as early as 1951. At that time, in order to take care of the actual situation at the time, it was stipulated that "in order to facilitate the participation of the people in the trial, the people's courts should implement the people's assessor system depending on the nature of the case." Today, the situation has developed greatly. In the past five years, the people of our country have been educated through various social reform movements, and their awareness has been greatly improved, and many people have served as assessors and have gained some experience. Therefore, the draft constitution stipulates the implementation of the people's assessor system.
Third, judicial democratization is reflected in the open trial system. Article 76 of the draft constitution stipulates that people's courts at all levels shall conduct trials openly, except in special circumstances stipulated by law. Open trial means that when the court holds a trial, in addition to the parties to the case and the defendant's defense counsel, ordinary people can also attend and have the right to speak under the condition of observing court order. The experience of the past two years, especially the experience of the judicial reform movement, has proved that the open trial system is an important form for the people's courts to rely on the masses to handle cases. It can absorb the masses to directly participate in judicial activities, help the courts accurately clarify the facts of the case, and promote the rapid resolution of the case.
As mentioned earlier, the open trial system is also an important method of conducting legal and disciplinary publicity and education. Through the open trial and mediation of cases, the parties to the case and the masses can be educated to understand and abide by the law. Legal and disciplinary publicity and education are important tasks of the people's courts.
Fourth, the provisions of the defense system fully demonstrate the further development of judicial democratization. Defense, in the Soviet Union, "is the sum of litigation acts in Soviet criminal procedure aimed at refuting the accusation (in whole or in part) and proving the innocence or lesser guilt of the defendant. Article 111 of the Soviet Constitution guarantees the defendant's right to defense. This means that the defendant (the accused) enjoys both the broad right and the possibility of exercising defense against the accusation, denying the accusation, presenting evidence and arguments, and also enjoys the right and the possibility of selecting a defense counsel of his choice in order to prove his innocence or reduce his responsibility" (see "Soviet Legal Dictionary"). In order to exercise the right of defense, the defendant may also choose someone he is satisfied with to defend himself in court. The defense counsel must be a close relative of the defendant, or a lawyer, or an authorized representative of a state organ or a people's organization, or a person permitted by the court. If the defendant has physical defects such as deafness or dumbness, the court may try to appoint a defense counsel for him so that he can exercise the right of defense.
Although our country does not yet have a clear defense system, in actual work in various places, the parties have always had the right to defense. Whether in the internal trial of the people's court or in the circuit trial and on-site trial of cases, the defendant and the defendant's relatives can exercise this right. The court's appeal system is a guarantee for the defendant to exercise the right of defense. The draft constitution affirms the defense system and stipulates in Article 76 that the defendant has the right to obtain defense when the people's court hears a case, which indicates the further democratization of the judicial system.
The task of defense is to assist the accused in exercising his rights and protecting his legitimate rights and interests, and to help the court to ascertain all the circumstances that are beneficial to the accused. Therefore, when performing this task, the defense counsel must abide by court order and maintain the public interest, and must not protect the accused's mistakes.
The provisions of the draft constitution on the establishment of the people's judicial organs and the various democratic principles of the trial system guarantee the further democratization of the judicial organs and the judicial system. Judicial democratization is an important aspect of national democratization. It can be believed that the further democratized judicial organs will play a greater role in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, guaranteeing national industrialization and various socialist transformations, and guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of citizens.
The principles stipulated in the draft constitution regarding the judicial system are all factually existing and will be further developed in the future. This democratic nature of our constitution does not exist in the constitutions of capitalist countries. Even if their constitutions have some hypocritical provisions, they are formal and hypocritical. In the United States, which claims to be the leader of the "free world," the constitution has been undermined, and the people's basic democratic rights are not guaranteed. The Rosenberg couple's murder case, which shocked the world, proves the bankruptcy of American judicial "democracy" and proves that the so-called "independent" judicial system in bourgeois countries is only a tool of the bourgeois dictatorship.
Only the constitutions of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries truly represent the will of the people, and only the judicial systems stipulated in these constitutions are truly systems that serve the people. The various judicial systems stipulated in the draft constitution of our country fully prove this point.

    宪法保证了我国司法制度进一步民主化
    ——对宪法草案的一点体会
  　顾凯
    民主化是建设社会主义社会的保证。宪法草案不仅巩固了我国人民已争得的民主权利，还促进了我们国家进一步的民主化。民主的精神是宪法的基本精神，它表现在宪法的各个部分里面。本文打算就宪法草案中关于司法机关的产生和活动等方面的规定来说明宪法草案怎样保证我国司法进一步民主化。 第一，司法民主化表现在司法机关的产生方面。宪法草案第二章第一节规定最高人民法院院长由全国人民代表大会选举，总检察长也由全国人民代表大会任命，全国人民代表大会有权罢免他们，他们的工作由全国人民代表大会常务委员会监督。第二章第四节中规定：县级以上人民法院院长由本级人民代表大会选举和罢免。宪法草案第八十条规定最高人民法院对全国人民代表大会负责并报告工作；在全国人民代表大会闭会期间，对全国人民代表大会常务委员会负责并报告工作。地方各级人民法院对本级人民代表大会负责并报告工作。我们从这些条文里可以看到最高人民法院、地方各级人民法院和检察机关都是在民主的基础上产生出来的。它们的检察和审判又都是依照全国人民代表大会所制定的法律法令进行的，并且要向人民代表大会报告工作，接受其审查监督。这说明人民司法机关真正是来自人民、属于人民和对人民负责的。这表现了我国的司法制度正在走上一个新的更高的阶段。
    第二，司法民主化表现在人民法院所实行的人民陪审制度上。宪法草案第七十五条规定，各级人民法院审判案件依照法律实行人民陪审员制度。
    人民陪审制度是司法民主的原则之一。这个原则是列宁提出来的。列宁说“我们要自行审判。人民应当人人参加审判工作和国家管理工作。……这是重要的。”（在“俄国共产党（布）第七次代表大会上关于修改党纲的报告”）又说“法庭正是吸引全体贫民参加国家管理的机关（因为司法事务是国家管理机能之一），法庭是无产阶级和贫苦农民底政权机关”（“苏维埃政权底当前任务”）。按照列宁的指示，苏联早在一九一七年建国之初就实行了人民陪审制度，在苏联，人民陪审员（或称临时审判员）和审判员（即常任审判员）有同等职权，都以同一程序选出。我国也已开始实行了这个制度。根据各地人民法院几年来办案的实践，证明这是必须实行的良好的制度；它一方面可以吸收群众参加司法活动，提高他们对国家的主人翁的责任感，另
  一方面又能密切人民法院和人民群众的联系，而
  “一切国家机关必须依靠人民群众，经常保持同群众的密切联系，倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督”，又是宪法草案所规定的。陪审员正好可以作为联系桥梁。我国近年来的情况是：在第二次全国司法会议以前，有些地方曾采用临时邀请或临时选派人民陪审员参加审判某些案件的办法，以后改为选出固定的陪审员临时参加审判某些案件；现在有的地方已选出固定的陪审员，固定的轮值参加审判案件，陪审员和审判员有同样的权利和义务，这反映了我国人民陪审员制是属于社会主义类型的陪审制，而其形式已更加完备。
    关于人民陪审制度，早在一九五一年颁布的
  “中华人民共和国人民法院暂行组织条例”中就规定了，那时为照顾当时实际情况，规定“为便于人民参与审判，人民法院应视案件性质，实行人民陪审制。”今天情况已有很大发展，五年来我国人民经过各项社会改革运动的教育，觉悟已有很大提高，并有许多人已担当过陪审员，有了一些经验，因此宪法草案规定实行人民陪审员制度。
    第三，司法民主化表现在公开审判制度方面。宪法草案第七十六条规定：各级人民法院审理案件，除法律规定的特别情况外一律公开进行。公开审判，就是法院开庭审判案件时，除案件当事人和被告辩护人参加外，普通群众也可出席旁听，并在遵守法庭秩序的条件下有发言权。两年来的经验特别是司法改革运动的经验证明：公开审判制度是人民法院依靠群众办案的重要形式，它可以吸收群众直接参与司法活动，帮助法院准确地搞清案情，促使案件迅速解决。
    如前所述，公开审判制度，也是进行法纪宣传教育的重要方法，通过案件的公开审判和调解，就能教育案件当事人和群众，使他们懂得法律、遵守法律，法纪宣传教育乃是人民法院的重要任务。
    第四，辩护制度的规定充分表现司法民主化的进一步发展。辩护，在苏联“是苏维埃刑事诉讼中旨在反驳控诉（全部或一部），证明被告人无罪或罪轻的诉讼行为总和。苏联宪法第一一一条保证被告人有辩护权。这是意味着，被告人（受审人）为了证明自己无罪或减轻自己责任起见，既享有对于控诉实行辩护、否认控诉、举出证据和论证的广泛权利和实现的可能，同时也享有选任辩护人的权利和实现的可能”（见“苏联法律词典”）。被告人为行使辩护的权利，本人亦可选择自己满意的人在法庭上为自己作辩护。辩护人必须是被告的近亲属，或者律师，或者国家机关、人民团体的受任代表，或经法院许可的人。如被告有聋、哑等生理缺陷，法院可设法为其指定辩护人，使他能行使辩护权利。
    我国虽然还没有明确的辩护制度，但在各地实际工作中，当事人从来就有辩护的权利，无论在人民法院的院内审判还是巡回审判、就地审判案件中，被告人以及被告的亲属都可行使这个权利。法院的上诉制度，更是被告行使辩护权利的保证。宪法草案肯定了辩护制度，在第七十六条中规定人民法院审理案件时被告人有权获得辩护，这表示司法制度的进一步民主化。
    辩护的任务，在于协助受审人行使其权利和保护其合法权益，帮助法院判明与受审人有利的一切情况。因此，辩护人在执行这一任务时，必须遵守法庭秩序、本着维护社会公益的立场，不能袒护受审人的错误。
    宪法草案关于人民司法机关的产生以及审判制度各项民主原则的规定，保证了司法机关和司法制度更进一步的民主化。司法民主化是国家民主化的重要方面，可以相信，进一步民主化的司法机关，将在巩固人民民主专政，保障国家工业化和各项社会主义改造，保障公民合法权益方面，发挥更大的力量。
    宪法草案关于司法制度方面的这些原则规定，都是事实上存在的，并要在今后获得进一步的发展。我们宪法的这种民主性在资本主义国家宪法里是没有的，即使他们的宪法有了某些虚伪的规定，也是形式的、虚伪的。在号称“自由世界”领导角色的美国，宪法已被破坏，人民起码的民主权利也没有保障，像震惊世界的罗森堡夫妇被害事件就证明了美国司法“民主”的破产，证明了资产阶级国家所谓“独立”的司法制度只是资产阶级专政的工具。
    只有苏联和人民民主国家的宪法才真正代表人民的意志，只有这些宪法所规定的司法制度，才是真正为人民服务的制度。我国宪法草案规定的各项司法制度充分证明了这个论点。
