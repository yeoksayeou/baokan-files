Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th (TASS): Moscow newspapers continue to comment on the six-nation Western European Foreign Ministers' Meeting that opened in Brussels on August 19th.

    *Pravda*'s correspondent G. Rasakin reported from Brussels that the reporters gathered there unanimously believed that "the purpose of the meeting was to exert new pressure on France and Italy to accelerate the ratification of the 'European Defense Community' treaty." Rasakin emphasized that "behind the scenes of the meeting, the United States was conducting extensive diplomatic activities, and observers here paid particular attention to the private talks between Mendès-France and Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak." It is believed that Spaak attempted to take a position at the meeting that would sway certain wavering French parliamentarians towards ratifying the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty. Rasakin continued by pointing out that the atmosphere of the Brussels meeting indicated that even within the narrow group of six countries participating in the "European Army" plan, there were significant differences. Belgian newspapers pointed out that one of the roots of the Franco-German division remains the Saar issue, which has resurfaced due to the holding of the Brussels meeting.

    *Izvestia* published an article by Mikhailov commenting on the meeting. He drew attention to the fact that neither those who advocate "revising" the Paris Treaty nor those who demand that France ratify the treaty without modification ever mention the issue of secret clauses, which are in fact an integral part of the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty. Mikhailov pointed out that the existence of secret clauses in the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty has been exposed more than once. As early as 1952, immediately after the conclusion of the militarist treaty, some Western Europeans noticed this fact. Mikhailov went on to say that new proof of the existence of secret agreements attached to the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty is the West German side's denial of the recent statement by John, the former head of the West German "Office for the Protection of the Constitution." Newspapers around the world have noted the fact that Adenauer had already attempted to refute John's statement before John even made it. This hasty action has exposed the true colors of the Bonn Chancellor. Moreover, he himself admitted in 1952 that there were secret clauses in the "European Defense Community" treaty. American and British officials also made "denials" after John's statement was published. Like him, they not only failed to deny, but actually confirmed the existence of secret agreements in the militarist treaty.

    Mikhailov concluded by pointing out that the plan of the organizers of the "European Defense Community" to establish an exclusive aggressive military bloc in Europe runs counter to the interests of the people of all European countries and is hostile to the interests of the people of all European countries.

    “真理报”和“消息报”评论西欧六国外长会议指出
    会议目的是要迫使法意加速批准“欧洲军”
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日电：莫斯科各报继续评论八月十九日在布鲁塞尔开幕的西欧六国外长会议。
    “真理报”记者格·拉萨金从布鲁塞尔报道说，聚集在这里的记者们一致认为，“会议的目的是要对法国和意大利施加新的压力，以加速批准‘欧洲防务集团’条约。”拉萨金着重指出，“在会议幕后，美国大肆外交活动，这里的观察员特别注意孟戴斯—弗朗斯和比利时外交大臣斯巴克的私人会谈。”有人认为，斯巴克企图在会上采取这样一种立场：使某些动摇的法国议员趋向于批准巴黎条约和波恩条约。拉萨金接着指出，布鲁塞尔会议的气氛表明，甚至在参与“欧洲军”计划的六国狭小集团的内部也存在着重大的分歧。比利时报纸指出，法德分歧的根源之一仍然是萨尔问题，由于布鲁塞尔会议的举行，这一问题又重新显露出来了。
    “消息报”发表了米哈伊洛夫评述会议的文章。他提起注意一种情况，即无论是主张“修改”巴黎条约的人或是要求法国不加修改就批准条约的人都绝口不谈秘密条款的问题，而这些条款实际上是巴黎条约和波恩条约的不可分割的部分。米哈伊洛夫指出，波恩条约和巴黎条约中有秘密条款存在这一事实已不止一次地被揭露过。早在一九五二年，军国主义的条约一经签订后，立即就有些西欧人士注意到这个事实。米哈伊洛夫接着说，巴黎条约和波恩条约中附有秘密协定一事的新的证明是西德方面对前西德“保卫宪法局”局长荣恩不久以前的声明所作的辟谣。全世界报纸都注意到一个事实，还是在荣恩发表声明以前，阿登纳就已企图驳斥荣恩的声明了。这种匆匆忙忙的行动已使波恩总理原形毕露。况且，他本人在一九五二年就已承认过“欧洲防务集团”条约中有秘密条款存在。美国和英国的官方人士也在荣恩的声明发表后作了“辟谣”。他们也一样不仅没有能否认，反而实际肯定了在军国主义的条约中有秘密协定存在。
    米哈伊洛夫最后指出，“欧洲防务集团”的组织者在欧洲建立排他的侵略军事集团的计划是和欧洲各国人民的利益背道而驰的，是敌视欧洲各国人民的利益的。
