The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1954, issue 32, has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "The Road to Strengthening Peace in Europe." The editorial points out that maintaining and consolidating peace in Europe and the world largely depends on the successful resolution of the issue of establishing an all-European collective security system. The Soviet Union's recent proposals for establishing such an effective system have attracted worldwide attention and sparked widespread discussion in various countries. The Soviet proposals are in line with the fundamental interests of the people of Europe. The intense interest and close attention paid to it by world public opinion demonstrates how correct, practical, and timely the Soviet Union's proposal is. The establishment of an all-European collective security system means rejecting the policy of reviving German militarism, rejecting the arms race and the policy of establishing exclusive aggressive blocs composed of certain European countries, and it means recognizing the possibility of coexistence of countries with different social systems, and recognizing the possibility of developing international cooperative relations and establishing broad economic relations between the countries concerned. The realization of the idea of all-European collective security will guarantee peace for the people of Europe and will be of utmost importance for maintaining universal peace and eliminating the danger of a new world war.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Major Tasks of the Italian Communist Party During the Preparation for the National Congress" by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, "The Soviet Union's New Peace Proposals" by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and "An Important Link in the Training of Cadres by the Czechoslovak Communist Party" by Vytiska, Member of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

Togliatti's article is a summary of his speech at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party on July 18. Togliatti pointed out that during the preparation for the National Party Congress, it is intended to launch a discussion so that the entire party and the citizens who follow us can better understand our current tasks and the tasks facing Italian workers, working people, and the entire society on the road to democracy and socialism. Analyzing the situation in Italy after the June 7 election, Togliatti pointed out: Currently, reactionary forces are intensifying their efforts to transform Italy's existing republican constitutional democratic system into a totalitarian system, and the pressure exerted on our government by foreign imperialism is increasing. Therefore, the purpose of our political action must first be to expose and vigorously oppose the conspiracy to turn the democratic system into a totalitarian system and allow the government to exercise arbitrary rule. We must unite those forces that can stop and reverse this conspiracy and get these forces to act. I think this is the main issue. Togliatti then described the intensification of clericalization in Italian society. He pointed out that the most likely assumption in the current situation is the gradual degeneration and totalitarianization of the political system, which will lead to fierce struggles in the economic and trade union spheres as well as in the political sphere. We must face this struggle and participate in this struggle.

Duclos's article pointed out that the Soviet Union's note of July 24 to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States aroused the anger of the American warmongers, but it was welcomed by hundreds of millions of people around the world who yearn for peace. The French people oppose the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty, which would turn West Germany into a hotbed of war. The people of Europe yearn for a policy of peace and security, and the Soviet proposal for a treaty on all-European collective security clearly expresses this policy. The Soviet proposal is based on the clear recognition of the principle that different social systems can coexist peacefully, allowing all European countries without exception to participate in the all-European collective security treaty, and suggests negotiations on this issue. It would be incomprehensible and intolerable if the French government obediently followed the US government and gave a negative response to such a wise and reasonable proposal. Therefore, the French working people, democrats, and patriots believe that a positive response must be given to the Soviet proposal before the debate on the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty. The French people must launch a vigorous struggle to prevent the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第三十二期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第三十二期中文版已经出版。
    本期以“加强欧洲和平的道路”为题发表社论。社论指出，维护并巩固欧洲以至全世界的和平，大部分要看建立全欧集体安全体系这一问题能不能顺利解决。苏联近来所提出的关于建立这样一个有效的体系的建议，引起全世界舆论界的重视，并在各国引起广泛的讨论。苏联的建议是符合欧洲各国人民的根本利益的。世界舆论界对它感到浓厚兴趣并予以密切注意，这说明苏联提出这一问题是多么正确、多么切合实际、多么及时。全欧集体安全体系的建立意味着拒绝复活德国军国主义的政策，拒绝军备竞赛和建立某些欧洲国家组成的排他性侵略集团的政策，它意味着承认不同社会制度的国家共处的可能性，承认发展国际合作关系、在各有关国家之间建立广泛的经济关系的可能性。全欧集体安全思想的实现将保证欧洲各国人民的和平，对于维护普遍和平、消除新的世界大战的危险将有极其重大的意义。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂的“意大利共产党人在全国代表会议筹备期间的重大任务”，法国共产党中央委员会书记处书记雅·杜克洛的“苏联的新的和平建议”和捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员维蒂斯卡的“捷克斯洛伐克共产党培养干部的重要环节”等。
    陶里亚蒂的文章是他在七月十八日意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议上发言的摘要。陶里亚蒂指出，在筹备全国党代表会议期间，打算展开一次讨论，使全党和跟着我们走的公民更好地了解我们当前的任务，更好地了解意大利工人、劳动人民以及整个社会在走向民主和社会主义的道路上所面临的任务。陶里亚蒂在分析六月七日选举以后意大利的形势时指出：目前，反动势力要加紧把意大利现有的共和立宪民主制度变为极权制度，外国帝国主义所加于我国政府的压力日益加重，因此，我们政治行动的目的，首先必须是揭露和有力地反对那把民主制度变为极权制度、使政府可以实行专横统治的阴谋。我们必须团结那些能够阻止并扭转这种阴谋的力量，并使这些力量行动起来。我认为这就是主要的问题。陶里亚蒂接着叙述了意大利社会加紧教权主义化的情况。他指出目前形势最可能的假定是政治制度的逐渐堕落和极权化，因而在经济方面和工会方面以及政治方面都会展开激烈的斗争。我们一定要面向这场斗争，参加这场斗争。
    杜克洛的文章指出，苏联七月二十四日致法、英、美三国政府的照会，引起了美国战争煽动者的愤怒，但是它却受到了全世界千百万渴望和平的人们的欢迎。法国人民反对批准变西德为战争温床的
  “欧洲防务集团”条约。欧洲各国人民渴望和平和安全政策，而苏联关于缔结全欧集体安全条约的建议就明确表示了这种政策。苏联的建议是以明确承认不同的社会制度可以和平共处这一原则为基础，让所有欧洲国家毫无例外地都参加全欧集体安全条约，并且建议就这一问题进行商谈。如果法国政府驯顺地追随美国政府，对这样明智的合理的建议给以否定的答复，那将是不可理解的，也是不能容许的。因此，法国劳动人民、民主人士和爱国者认为必须在进行关于批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的辩论之前，对苏联的建议作肯定的答复。法国人民必须发动一个有力的斗争来阻止“欧洲防务集团”条约的批准。（新华社）
