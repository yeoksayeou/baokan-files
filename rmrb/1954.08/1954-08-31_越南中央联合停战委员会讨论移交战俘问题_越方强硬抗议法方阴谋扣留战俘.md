Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, August 29th: Over the past few days, the issue of transferring prisoners of war has been the main topic of discussion at the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission of Vietnam in Phu Lo. At the meeting on the 24th, the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army formally protested against many acts of the French side that violated the ceasefire agreement and violated the agreement signed by the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission on August 14th in Zhongjia. The specific documents cited by the delegation of the Vietnamese People's Army revealed the conspiracy of the Ngo Dinh Diem group to detain prisoners of war and cadres held by them. The General Command of the French Federation Forces did not express a clear attitude towards this conspiracy, and even condoned it.

The International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission of Vietnam held a meeting with the two delegations on the 25th and put forward a motion. Afterwards, the sub-committee responsible for studying the issue of prisoners of war in the Joint Ceasefire Commission held two meetings on the 26th and 27th. Based on the motion put forward by the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission, the delegation of the Vietnamese People's Army patiently and sincerely clarified its opinions in order to obtain a just solution for both parties. However, the delegation of the French Federation Forces was single-mindedly focused on limiting the discussion to purely technical issues. It refused to discuss this issue: the transfer of all prisoners of war still detained by the French side but whose entire list was not included in the prisoner-of-war roster. Despite the patient explanations of the Vietnamese People's Army delegation, the delegation of the French Federation Forces still adopted the same attitude. This attitude has caused many difficulties in resolving the prisoner-of-war issue.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army have clearly demonstrated through practical actions that they are prepared and determined to quickly release all prisoners of war on the other side. However, they cannot turn a blind eye to the conspiracy to detain prisoners of war and the French Federation Forces' condoning of the Ngo Dinh Diem group's conspiracy.

    越南中央联合停战委员会讨论移交战俘问题
    越方强硬抗议法方阴谋扣留战俘
    【新华社二十九日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十九日讯：过去几天中，移交战俘问题一直是越南中央联合停战委员会在扶罗所讨论的主要问题。越南人民军总司令部代表团在二十四日的会议上正式抗议法方许多违反停战协定和违反中央联合停战委员会八月十四日在中稼所签订的协议的行为。越南人民军代表团所引证的具体文件，揭露了吴庭艳集团扣留为他们所拘禁的战俘和干部的阴谋。法兰西联邦部队总司令部对这种阴谋不表示明确态度，甚至还加以纵容。
    越南国际监督和监察委员会二十五日同双方代表团举行了会议，并提出一项动议。此后，联合停战委员会中的负责研究战俘问题的小组委员会在二十六日和二十七日举行了两次会议。越南人民军代表团根据国际监督和监察委员会提出的动议，耐心地、诚恳地阐明了自己的意见，以便取得一项对双方都是公正的解决办法。但是，法兰西联邦部队代表团却一心要把讨论的问题限于纯技术性的问题上。它拒绝讨论这个问题：移交所有仍然为法方所拘留然而整个名单并未列入战俘名册中的战俘。虽然经过越南人民军代表团的耐心解释，法兰西联邦部队代表团仍然采取同样态度。这种态度已在解决战俘问题上引起许多困难。
    越南民主共和国政府和越南人民军总司令部代表团已经用实际行动明确地表明他们准备而且决意要把对方的全部战俘迅速释放。但是他们不能对扣留战俘的阴谋以及法兰西联邦部队对吴庭艳集团的阴谋的纵容熟视无睹。
