Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Parts of Hebei Province
Vigorously Transfer Materials to Ensure Supply During the Rainy Season

    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hebei Province are actively transferring goods to grassroots supply points to ensure that a large amount of materials are supplied to the masses during the rainy season.

    The Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Commerce and the Hebei Provincial Cooperative Headquarters jointly issued instructions, requiring their subordinate units to transfer daily necessities such as coal, kerosene, salt, matches, alkali, etc., in accordance with the actual needs of various places during the rainy season, to grassroots sales units within a prescribed time limit. At present, the supply and marketing cooperatives of Tangshan, Tianjin, Cangxian, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Baoding and other regions are actively transferring materials to grassroots supply points. The supply and marketing cooperatives in the Tianjin region have already transported 3,390 tons of coal, 500 barrels of kerosene, 900 packages of alkali, and 590,000 jin of edible oil to grassroots supply points, and more than 7.63 million jin of coarse grains to county-level and grassroots cooperatives. In addition, flood prevention and waterlogging prevention supplies such as earthen baskets have also been prepared. The supply and marketing cooperatives in the Cangxian region have transported 3,326 tons of coal and a large number of kerosene, salt, alkali, etc. to 79 grassroots supply points. Some county cooperative unions in Shijiazhuang, Xingtai and other regions have also prepared and supplied a batch of late-season crop seeds according to local needs.

    In order to supply various materials to the masses in a timely manner, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hebei Province, in addition to selling goods in stores, setting up stalls and supplying them at fairs, have also actively carried out the work of delivering goods to the countryside. According to incomplete statistics from 114 grassroots cooperatives in the Cangxian region in June, a total of 2,207 deliveries were made to the countryside, with a total value of supplies reaching 2.096 billion yuan. Some grassroots cooperatives in Cangxian, whose delivery teams to the countryside were unable to travel by truck due to muddy roads after the rain, changed to using carrying poles and human backs to continue delivering goods to the countryside, which was warmly welcomed by the masses.

    河北省各地供销合作社
    大力调运物资保证雨季供应
    河北省各地供销合作社积极向基层供应点调运货物，保证在雨季有大量的物资供应给群众。
    河北省人民政府商业厅和河北省合作总社曾联合发出指示，要求所属将日用必需品，如煤炭、煤油、食盐、火柴、碱面等，根据雨季期间各地实际需要量，限期分散调运到基层销售单位。目前，唐山、天津、沧县、邢台、石家庄、保定等专区的供销合作社正积极向基层供应点调运物资。天津专区的供销合作社已运给基层供应点三千三百九十吨煤炭、五百桶煤油、九百包碱面、五十九万斤食油，运给县级和基层合作社七百六十三万多斤粗粮，另外，还准备了土筐等防汛、防涝用品。沧县专区的供销合作社已将三千三百二十六吨煤炭及大批煤油、食盐、碱面等运到七十九个基层供应点。石家庄、邢台等专区的部分县合作社联合社还根据当地需要，准备和供应了一批晚种作物的种籽。
    为了及时把各种物资供应到群众手中，河北各地供销合作社除在门市部出售，摆摊、赶集供应外，还积极开展了下乡送货的工作。据沧县专区一百一十四个基层合作社六月份的不完全统计，共下乡送货二千二百零七次，供应物资总值达二十亿九千六百多万元。沧县有的基层合作社的下乡送货小组，因雨后道路泥泞不能走大车，便改用挑担、人背的办法，继续下乡送货，受到群众热烈欢迎。（戚连振）
