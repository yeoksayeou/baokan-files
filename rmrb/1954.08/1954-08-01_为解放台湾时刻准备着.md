    Always Be Ready to Liberate Taiwan
    Xu Eryue, Combat Hero of a Coastal Defense Unit of the People's Liberation Army
    "August 1st" is the great festival of the founding of our People's Liberation Army. As an ordinary soldier of the People's Liberation Army, I feel extremely honored and filled with unparalleled excitement every time I commemorate this festival. I joined the revolutionary army at the age of seventeen. Under the cultivation and education of the Party and superiors, my political awareness and military skills have been continuously improving. Therefore, in every battle in the past, as long as I thought of the suffering days of the past and the future socialist prospects, my whole body was filled with strength. I remember that in the battle to besiege Luoyang in March 1948, the fighting was very fierce. When our troops were penetrating the enemy's position and taking the opportunity to search forward, we were suddenly blocked by a burst of dense enemy artillery fire, and I lost contact with the comrades in my squad. At this tense moment, I discovered that there were about a company of enemies in a cave near me, clamoring in panic. If I contacted other comrades, I was afraid of exposing the target, losing the opportunity, and letting the enemies go. So, I rushed over quickly, using submachine guns to sweep and hand grenades to bombard, and finally confused the enemy, forcing them all to surrender. In June of the same year, when our army attacked Kaifeng, our squad was tasked with storming the North City Tower. I was the first to rush up. At this time, the enemy threw a grenade, and I suffered five injuries to my left arm, but I continued to fight with one hand. Unexpectedly, the cunning enemy pushed down the earthen wall, pinning half of my body down. At the same time, two enemies rushed towards me. I struggled to raise my gun with one hand and shot down one enemy. The other enemy threw a grenade and knocked me unconscious. When I woke up, I was already lying in a hospital bed. At that time, although my injuries were very serious, the first thing I thought about was whether the enemy had been eliminated? Had Kaifeng been liberated? Because I always had such a firm belief: it is supremely glorious to be wounded, bleed, or even sacrifice one's life for the cause of the people's liberation. And for this great cause, a price must be paid.
    Today, when I recall those difficult and victorious battles, and when I see that the ideals pursued by countless revolutionary martyrs through heroic struggle, bloodshed, and sacrifice are gradually being realized, I feel even more deeply my own responsibility and glory.
    Now, I am performing the task of guarding the coastal defense of the motherland. I deeply understand that the enemies we have defeated are not reconciled. American imperialism, colluding with the remnant Chiang bandits, still occupies our territory—Taiwan—and constantly carries out military provocations in the southeastern coastal areas of our country. Especially recently, the provocations have become even more frantic, which poses a threat to the security of our country and the integrity of our territorial sovereignty. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. Therefore, on this day of commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day, I solemnly swear to the people of the motherland: I will definitely fulfill the glorious duty entrusted to us by the people of the motherland and use practical actions to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend the security of the country and the integrity of our territorial sovereignty. I must always be ready, await the orders of the motherland, and fight for the liberation of Taiwan and for the final completion of the Chinese people's liberation cause!

    为解放台湾时刻准备着
    解放军海防某部  战斗英雄  许而月
    “八一”是我们人民解放军建军的伟大节日。作为人民解放军一个普通的战士，每逢纪念这个节日的时候，我心里都感到极大的光荣和充满无比的兴奋。我在十七岁时就参加了革命军队，在党和上级的培养教育下，我的政治觉悟和军事素养都在不断地提高着。所以，在过去的每次战斗中，只要一想起从前受苦的日子，一想到未来的社会主义远景，我浑身就充满了力量。记得，在一九四八年三月围攻洛阳的战役中，战斗十分激烈，当我们部队插入敌人阵地正乘机搜索前进的时候，忽然又受到敌人一阵密集炮火的阻拦，我和班里同志们失掉了联系。也就在这个紧张的时刻，我发现在我身旁附近一个洞里有约一个连的敌人正在惊慌的嚷叫着。要和别的同志联系，又怕暴露了目标，失掉了战机，放过了敌人。于是，我飞快地扑了过去，用冲锋枪扫射，用手榴弹猛轰，终于迷惑了敌人，迫使他们全部缴枪当了俘虏。同年六月，我军攻打开封时，我们班担任突击北城楼的任务。我第一个冲了上去，这时敌人打来了一个手榴弹，我左臂负了五处伤，仍继续用一只手坚持战斗。不料狡猾的敌人推倒了土墙，压住了我半截身子，同时有两个敌人眼看就向我跟前扑上来，我挣扎着一只手举枪打倒了一个敌人，另一个敌人投来手榴弹把我炸昏过去了。当我醒来时，我已躺在医院的床上。那时我的伤虽然很重，但是我首先想到的是敌人消灭了没有？开封解放了没有？因为我始终有这样一个坚强的信念：为人民的解放事业负伤流血甚至献出生命都是无尚光荣的。而为了这伟大的事业，就必须付出代价。
    今天，当我回忆起那些艰苦的胜利的战斗的时候，当我看到无数革命先烈英勇奋斗流血牺牲所追求的理想已在逐步实现的时候，我也就越感到自己的责任重大和光荣了。
    现在，我正执行着守卫祖国海防的任务，我深深懂得，被我们打败了的敌人并不死心，美帝国主义勾结残余蒋匪仍侵占着我国领土——台湾，并不断地在我国东南沿海进行军事挑衅，特别是最近，挑衅更加疯狂起来了，这对我们国家的安全和领土主权的完整造成了威胁，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。因此，在纪念“八一”建军节的今天，我特向祖国人民宣誓：我一定切实履行祖国人民赋予我们的光荣职责，用实际行动，来保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家安全和领土主权的完整。我一定要时刻准备着，听候祖国的命令，为解放台湾，为最后完成中国人民解放事业而奋斗！
