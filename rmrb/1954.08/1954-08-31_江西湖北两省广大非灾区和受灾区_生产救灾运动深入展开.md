Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, August 30th: The plan to expand planting of over 7 million mu of crops in the broad non-disaster and lightly affected areas of Jiangxi Province has been basically completed, with the exception of some ratooning rice and certain autumn crops. By mid-August, farmers in the Ji'an Special District alone had cultivated over 1 million mu of ratooning rice. The original plan to cultivate 400,000 mu of ratooning rice in the Fuzhou Special District has also been exceeded. According to preliminary calculations, among these expanded crops, the late double-cropping rice (including replanted and supplemented late rice) in Nanchang Special District and the ratooning rice in Nanchang and Ji'an Special Districts alone can increase rice production by more than 480 million jin. The late rice and various autumn crops planted in various places are growing very well. Some ratooning rice in Anfu, Xiajiang, Nancheng, and Le'an counties has already headed and is bearing many grains. In areas along the river and lake with severe disaster conditions, the struggle of the broad masses of farmers to rush-plant late rice and various coarse grains has also achieved great success. Farmers in Poyang, Yugan, Wannian, Leping, Nanchang, and Xinjian counties have rushed to plant more than 400,000 mu of late rice and autumn crops such as late soybeans and buckwheat. Various sideline production activities have also been widely launched. It is estimated that Poyang Lake alone can produce 60 million jin of fish this year. Large-scale fishing activities, one of the main sideline activities of disaster-stricken farmers in counties along the river and lake, have begun. Farmers in the Second District of Poyang County have repaired more than 400 various fishing nets and are actively engaged in fishing. The Third District of Poyang County organized a fishing team of more than 3,500 people, and the Ninth District of Jiujiang County also organized 26 fishery mutual aid groups, which have started or are about to start fishing activities. The newly formed fishing group of the Duan Moyang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Poyang County has been fishing in the lake since the beginning of August. In recent days, they have caught an average of more than 100 jin of fresh fish every day.

Now, the movement to increase production and practice economy for disaster relief in rural Jiangxi Province has entered a new stage. The broad masses of farmers are starting from aspects such as water storage for drought prevention, pest control, increased fertilizer application, careful cultivation and fine work, and are fighting to increase the unit area yield of late rice and various autumn crops.

After the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on increasing production and practicing economy for disaster relief in late July, the First Session of the First People's Congress of Jiangxi Province also made relevant resolutions. Subsequently, the People's Government issued more than 40 billion yuan in loans and 18 billion yuan in relief funds, and a large number of seeds supported by various places were continuously transported to the countryside. More than 20,000 cadres and members of more than 6,000 rural branches of the Communist Party of China have quickly投入 themselves into the work of increasing production and practicing economy for disaster relief. More than 1.9 million farming households participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations are actively leading the broad masses of farmers to carry out the work of increasing production and practicing economy for disaster relief. Thus, such a wide-ranging activity was quickly launched in an organized and leadership-driven manner.

(Reported by this newspaper) The broad masses of farmers in Hubei Province, in response to the call of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to exceed grain and cotton production and make up for the losses caused by the floods, have launched a large-scale autumn multi-planting and multi-harvesting campaign to strive for increased grain and cotton production; the people in the disaster areas have launched a production self-relief movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation.

Agricultural production cooperatives in various disaster-stricken areas of the Xiaogan Special District, Hubei Province, are actively restoring production. The Xin Xin, Hong Yan, and Chun He cooperatives in Wuchang County plan to plant late rice after harvesting glutinous rice; in addition to expanding the planting area and cultivating ratooning rice, they can achieve the goal of increasing production. Thirteen cooperatives in Hanyang, Jiayu, and Wuchang counties plan to expand the late rice planting area by more than 200 mu, which is expected to yield 57,000 jin. At present, the members of the cooperatives are seizing the opportunity to weed and top-dress the existing crops. In the fields washed away by mountain floods and areas where accumulated water has been drained, the members are replanting and supplementing seedlings. After the first flood subsided, the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiayu County seized the opportunity to replant 60 mu of cotton and transplanted more than 6,000 seedlings.

Cotton farmers in Xiangyang Special District are actively carrying out cotton field pest control, weeding, and seedling protection to eliminate the phenomenon of weak seedlings and weedy fields. Under the slogan of "Remove one patch as one patch, don't be idle whether it's sunny or rainy," cotton farmers in various places are fighting against cloudy and rainy weather to eliminate weed infestation. In Suixian County, more than 48,000 mu of cotton fields were cleared of weeds in ten days, and more than 6,000 mu of cotton fields were top-dressed. Various places have also launched a "Seedling Protection Assault Week" to carry out cotton field weeding, pest control, top-dressing, and pruning. In order to comprehensively and balancedly carry out the cotton production increase movement, all localities rely on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to carry out field inspections, visits, and comparisons.

The people from the disaster area of Huangmei who have been resettled in Yangxin County are now vigorously carrying out a production self-relief movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation. The Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Tenth District of Huangmei transferred to the Tenth District of Yangxin County, and in seven days, they reclaimed 12 mu of wasteland and sowed 6 mu of corn in a timely manner. Under the leadership of the Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative, disaster victims in the entire district organized mutual aid groups on the basis of the original mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In addition to drawing a portion of the labor force to engage in sideline production, the main labor force was used for reclamation. In six days, the entire district reclaimed 193 mu of wasteland, of which 78 mu have been planted with autumn crops. The disaster victims who were transferred to Xia Yang Township in the Fifth District of Yangxin adopted the method of organizing 16 production and disaster relief brigades with natural villages as units and the original mutual aid groups as the foundation, formulated agricultural and sideline production plans, and vigorously carried out wasteland reclamation and sideline production.

While the farmers were carrying out production for disaster relief, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hubei Province have supplied farmers with several million jin of late autumn crop seeds and a large amount of fertilizer.

    江西湖北两省广大非灾区和受灾区
    生产救灾运动深入展开
    【新华社南昌三十日电】江西省广大非灾区和轻灾区，扩大种植七百多万亩农作物的计划，除部分再生稻和某些秋季作物外，已经基本完成。到八月中旬止，仅吉安专区的农民就已培育了再生稻一百多万亩。抚州专区原来计划培育四十万亩再生稻的计划也已经被突破。据初步计算，在这些扩大种植的农作物中，仅南昌专区扩种的双季晚稻（包括改种补种的晚稻）和南昌、吉安两专区的再生稻，就可以额外增产四亿八千多万斤稻谷。各地种植的晚稻和各种秋季作物都生长得很好。安福、峡江、南城、乐安等县的部分再生稻已经打苞抽穗，谷粒很多。在沿江滨湖灾情较重地区，广大农民抢种晚稻和各种杂粮的斗争也取得了很大的成就。鄱阳、余干、万年、乐平、南昌、新建等县农民已经抢种了晚稻和晚大豆、荞麦等秋季作物四十多万亩。各种副业生产活动也已广泛展开。据估计，仅鄱阳湖今年就可以产鱼六千万斤。沿江滨湖各县受灾农民主要副业活动之一——大规模的捕鱼活动已经开始。鄱阳县第二区的农民已经修补了各种渔网四百多部，积极展开捕鱼活动。鄱阳县第三区组织了一个三千五百多人的捕鱼大队，九江县第九区也组织了二十六个渔业互助组，已经展开或即将展开捕鱼活动。鄱阳县段谟扬农业生产合作社新组成的捕鱼组，从八月上旬起就开始驾着渔船在湖里捕鱼，这些天来，他们平均每天捕到一百多斤鲜鱼。
    现在江西省农村增产节约生产救灾运动已进入新的阶段。广大农民正从蓄水防旱、防治虫害、增施肥料、精耕细作等方面入手，为争取提高晚稻和各种秋季作物的单位面积产量而斗争。
    七月下旬，中共江西省委员会发出增产节约生产救灾指示后，江西省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议也作出了有关决议。接着人民政府发放了四百多亿元的贷款、一百八十亿元的救济款，各地支援的大批种籽，不断地运到农村中。两万多干部和六千多个中共农村支部的成员，都迅速投入到增产节约和生产救灾工作中去。参加互助合作组织的一百九十多万户农户，积极带领广大农民开展增产节约生产救灾工作。于是这样一个广泛的活动，便有组织有领导地迅速开展起来。
      【本报讯】湖北省广大农民响应中共湖北省委员会关于超额增产粮棉，弥补水灾损失的号召，开展了大规模秋季多种多收，争取粮棉增产运动；灾区人民开展了以互助合作为中心的生产自救运动。
    湖北省孝感专区受灾各地的农业生产合作社正积极恢复生产。武昌县新新、红焰、春和三个社计划把糯米谷收割后，种晚稻；加上扩大种植面积、培育再生稻等，就可以达到增产的目的。汉阳、嘉鱼，武昌三县的十三个社，计划扩大晚稻种植面积二百多亩，预计可收五万七千斤。目前各社社员正抓紧时机对现有农作物进行薅草和追肥。山洪冲毁的田地和积水已排出的地区，社员们正进行改种、补种。嘉鱼县红旗农业生产合作社第一次积水退后，就抓紧时机补种了六十亩棉花，并移苗六千多株。
    襄阳专区棉农积极进行棉田除虫、除草、保苗，消灭苗瘦草荒现象。各地棉农在“除一块是一块，天晴天雨不闲人”的口号下，向阴雨作斗争，消灭草荒。随县在十天内就有四万八千多亩棉田消除了草荒，并有六千多亩棉田追了一道肥。各地还开展了“保苗突击周”，进行棉田除草、除虫、追肥、整枝。各地为全面地平衡地开展棉花增产运动，都依靠互助合作组织，展开田间检查，参观评比。
    安置在阳新县的黄梅灾区人民，现正大力开展以互助合作为中心的生产自救运动。黄梅十区五星农业生产合作社转移到阳新县第十区后，在七天内开垦了荒地十二亩，并及时播种了苞谷六亩。在五星农业生产合作社的带头行动下，全区灾民在原有互助合作组织的基础上纷纷组织互助组，除抽出一部分劳动力从事副业生产外，以主要的劳动力进行开荒，在六天的时间内，全区开垦了荒地一百九十三亩，其中七十八亩已播下了秋季作物。转移到阳新五区下杨乡的灾民，采取以自然村为单位，以原有互助组为基础，组织了十六个生产救灾大队，订出了农副业生产计划，大力进行开荒和副业生产。
    在农民进行生产救灾的时候，湖北省各地供销合作社已有几百万斤晚秋作物种籽和大批肥料供应给农民。
