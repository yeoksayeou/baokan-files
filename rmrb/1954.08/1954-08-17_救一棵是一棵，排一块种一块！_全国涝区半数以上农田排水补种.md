Save Every Plant Possible, Drain Every Field and Plant It!
More Than Half of the Flooded Farmland Nationwide Has Been Drained and Replanted

    As of early August, more than half of the flooded areas nationwide had their water drained. Since August, the weather in the flood-stricken areas of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin has cleared up, and rainfall has decreased compared to the previous period. At present, the water levels of rivers and lakes are generally falling, except for some local areas such as Wuhan where they continue to rise, and the flood situation is stabilizing. In order not to miss the farming season, farmers in the flood-stricken areas, under the leadership of the local Communist Party committees and people's governments, are comprehensively and intensively carrying out drainage and replanting work. Various localities are required to strive to plant various late autumn crops in August, plant more and harvest more, to make up for the losses. In Zhejiang Province, the vast majority of the drained farmland has been replanted with late rice. Recently, the water level of inland rivers in Anhui Province has generally dropped, and the area replanted on the drained farmland in the province has accounted for 30% of the drained area. In the Fuyang area, the farmland that has been drained has been replanted with sweet potatoes, broad beans, buckwheat, and carrots; in the Huainan area, many of the drained farmlands do not need to be replanted and can retain the seedlings. In Jiangsu Province, 1.7 million cadres and farmers are actively engaged in flood control and drainage, and have drained the water from most of the areas, and are carrying out replanting. In Henan Province, 31 counties have basically completed the drainage of accumulated water. In the six counties of Huaibin, Shenqiu, Wuyang, Lin颍, Xihua, and Yancheng, where the accumulated water is deeper, 90% of the water has also been drained. As of August 8, preliminary statistics from eleven counties, including Yancheng, Xiangcheng, Dancheng, and Shenqiu, show that many farmlands have been replanted with late autumn crops. In Hebei Province, there has been more rain recently, but drainage is still being intensified as the water recedes. In the Baoding area, 73% of the seedlings in the drained farmland can be preserved for harvest, and another 27% of the farmland is being rushed to plant late autumn crops.
    The low-lying flooded areas are also concentrating manpower and material resources for drainage and replanting. In Shucheng County, Lu'an area, Anhui Province, relying on mutual aid and cooperation organizations as the foundation, and taking townships and embankment sections as units, drainage teams, sub-teams, and squads were formed. Under the slogan of "save every plant possible, drain every field and plant it," six water pumps and all available waterwheels were mobilized for intensive drainage. In Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province, in order to solve the shortage of labor and ensure that both production and flood prevention are not delayed, measures are taken to take polders as units, mutual aid and cooperation organizations as the foundation, absorb individual farmers to participate, and implement unified allocation of labor. All labor is concentrated on repairing and protecting polders; half of the labor force is engaged in replanting and field management such as weeding, hoeing, and fertilizing, and work is divided and contracted. In Zhangqiao and Xiaqiao villages, Yaofeng Township, based on 42 mutual aid groups, labor is uniformly allocated, and labor competitions are carried out, and labor efficiency is increased by 20%. In some flood-affected areas of Hunan Province, efforts are being made to plug breaches and drain water. In the lakeside counties of Changde and Anxiang, 400,000 mu can be drained and replanted with late rice in the next few days.
    In the low-lying areas with deeper water accumulation, there are still difficulties in drainage. Most of the local residents have been transferred to the mountains to reclaim wasteland for production under the condition that it does not hinder soil and water conservation. It is estimated that 4.7 million mu of wasteland can be reclaimed in Anhui Province, and 1.25 million mu have already been reclaimed in the three areas of Wuhu, Anqing, and Lu'an. People in the Anqing area who have moved to other counties to reclaim wasteland are striving to reclaim 1.5 million mu, mainly planting short-term, high-yield crops such as corn. Hunan Province is planning and leading the relocation of residents from disaster areas to nearby mountainous and hilly areas, distributing public mountains and reclaimed wasteland to the victims, and strongly supporting them in carrying out production for self-rescue, and striving to plant a season.
    In areas where mountain torrents have erupted, the water recedes quickly, and most of them have resumed production. In Hunan, all the farmland affected by mountain torrents, except for a few fields that were washed away and cannot be replanted, have been replanted. In Hubei Province, areas affected by mountain torrents are also vigorously resuming production. In Tongshan County, relying on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, for the fields that will reduce production by 10% to 30%, timely watering, seedling washing, weeding, and seedling support are carried out, and processing and topdressing are generally carried out; more than 90% of the fields where seedlings have been completely washed away have been planted with crops such as corn, sesame, and broad beans.
    The Central People's Government and the people's governments of various provinces have successively allocated a large number of various late autumn crop seeds, plus the seeds originally stored in various provinces, which can basically solve the seed problem for replanting in disaster-stricken farmland. Now, cadres and farmers in the disaster areas are doing everything possible to continue to expand the drainage area, seize the season, and plant late autumn crops as soon as possible.

    救一棵是一棵，排一块种一块！
    全国涝区半数以上农田排水补种
    截至八月上旬，全国受涝地区，已有半数以上农田排除积水。八月以来，长江中、下游和淮河流域遭受水灾地区天气转晴，雨天较前期减少。目前江湖水位，除武汉等局部地区续有上涨外，都普遍下落，水情趋向平稳。为了不误农时，水灾地区农民正在当地中共党委和人民政府领导下，全面而紧张地展开排涝补种工作。各地要求争取在八月份内种下各种晚秋作物，多种多收，弥补损失。浙江省排除积水的农田，绝大部分已改种晚稻。近日来安徽省内河水位普遍下降，全省脱水的农田补种的面积已占排水面积的百分之三十。阜阳专区退了水的农田改种了甘薯、?豆、荞麦和胡萝卜；淮南地区退水的农田，有许多不需改种就可以保苗。江苏省一百七十万干部和农民积极防汛排涝，已将绝大部分地区积水排出，正在进行改种和补种。河南省已有三十一县的积水基本排完。淮滨、沈邱、舞阳、临颍、西华、郾城六个县积水较深，也排出百分之九十。截至八月八日，郾城、项城、郸城、沈邱等十一县初步统计，有许多农田已补种了晚秋作物。河北省近日多雨，但仍加紧随落随排。保定专区排出积水的农田中，有百分之七十三的禾苗可以保住收成，另有百分之二十七的农田正在抢种晚秋作物。
    地势稍低的涝区，也在集中人力物力排涝补种。安徽省六安专区舒城县依靠互助合作组织为基础，以乡和堤段为单位，组成排涝中队、分队和小队，在“救一棵是一棵，排一块种一块”的口号下，动员了六部抽水机和全部可以动用的水车，在紧张排水。江苏震泽县为了解决劳动力不足，做到生产防汛两不误，采取以圩堤为单位，互助合作组织为基础，吸收单干农民参加，实行统一分配劳动力。全劳动力集中修圩堤、保圩堤；半劳动力作补种和耘耥、施肥等田间管理工作，并划片分工包干。尧峰乡张桥、夏桥两村，以四十二个互助组为基础，统一分配劳动力，开展劳动竞赛，劳动效率提高了百分之二十。湖南省水涝的部分地区正积极进行堵口排涝。滨湖的常德、安乡等县，最近几天即可排出四十万亩，补栽晚稻。
    积水较深的低洼地带，目前排涝还有困难，当地居民大都已转移到山区，在不妨碍水土保持的条件下开荒生产。安徽省估计可开荒四百七十万亩，芜湖、安庆、六安三专区已经开了一百二十五万亩。安庆专区移到外县开荒的人民，争取开荒一百五十万亩，主要种玉米等短期成熟的高产作物。湖南省有计划有领导地把受灾地区居民迁移到邻近山区、丘陵地带，把公山、熟荒分给灾民，大力支持他们进行生产自救，争取种上一季。
    山洪暴发地区，退水较快，绝大部分已恢复生产。湖南受山洪灾害的农田，除少数被冲毁无法再种的田以外，已经全部补种。湖北省受山洪灾害地区，也正大力恢复生产。通山县依靠互助合作组织，对于将减产一成到三成的田，做到及时浇水、洗苗、薅草、扶苗，并且普遍进行了加工、追肥；秧苗被水全部冲毁的田亩，有百分之九十以上已种上了玉米、芝麻、?豆等作物。
    中央人民政府和各省人民政府已先后拨出大量各种晚秋作物种籽，加上各省原有贮存的种籽，可基本解决受灾农田补种的种籽问题。现在，灾区的干部和农民群众正尽一切力量，继续扩大排水面积，抓紧季节，尽早种上晚秋庄稼。（新华社）
