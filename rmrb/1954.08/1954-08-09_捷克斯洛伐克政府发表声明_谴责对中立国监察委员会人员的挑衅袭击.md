Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 6th: The Czechoslovak News Agency reported that the Czechoslovak government issued a statement regarding the recent provocative attacks on personnel from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    The people of Czechoslovakia are extremely indignant upon hearing news of several attacks carried out by the Syngman Rhee authorities in South Korean ports in recent days against Czechoslovak and Polish personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea. These attacks have become so serious that they directly threaten the personal safety and lives of Czechoslovak and Polish personnel in this commission. The purpose of these recent provocative actions by Syngman Rhee is to prevent the inspection teams in South Korean ports from carrying out their work, and at the same time to undermine the activities of the Supervisory Commission, which, according to the terms of the Armistice Agreement, is assigned the important task of preventing the resumption of military actions in Korea.

    The increase in attacks on personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission after the end of the Geneva Conference is not accidental. Due to the signing of the Indochina ceasefire agreement, and due to the agreement reached on the settlement of the Indochina issue, the forces of peace have gained a major victory. The American aggressive bloc suffered a new and crushing defeat in Geneva. This is the reason for their fury and intensified efforts to create new centers of war in Asia.

    The recent terrorist attacks against Supervisory Commission personnel in South Korea are closely related to the recent provocative actions by the United States near Hainan Island, China, and are also closely related to new efforts to conclude an aggressive treaty in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, to the bellicose statements made by Syngman Rhee in the U.S. Congress, and to the increasing verbal attacks by U.S. officials against the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries.

    These actions are manifestations of attempts to prevent the relaxation of international tensions, to further threaten peace and security in Asia, and to obstruct the settlement of all disputes through consultation and agreement.

    The attitude of the U.S. delegation at the Geneva Conference once again proves that the aggressive forces of the United States are opposed to the peaceful unification of Korea and to the transformation of the armistice into a permanent peace. In order to maintain South Korea as a strategic base for launching a new aggression against the Asian continent, the U.S. ruling clique has been trying for months to dissolve this important international body – the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. In order to pursue their aggressive aims, they are violating the Armistice Agreement, especially by illegally importing war materials and arming Syngman Rhee's troops for new military adventures. In particular, due to the work carried out by the representatives of Czechoslovakia and Poland, the Supervisory Commission has repeatedly published the fact that the American side in Korea has repeatedly violated the terms of the Armistice Agreement. From the time the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was established, the U.S. ruling clique has attempted to undermine the prestige and activities of the commission by every possible means, one of which is to spread unfounded accusations against the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the commission. They are now once again attempting to undermine the activities of the commission by inciting Syngman Rhee's agents to attack the commission members. By doing so, the U.S. ruling clique is attempting to remove witnesses they do not want, so that they can establish their base of aggression in South Korea as they please. World opinion cannot ignore these increasing attacks on personnel of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, because the interruption of the commission's activities would mean a serious violation of the terms of the Armistice Agreement. Slanderous and barbarous attacks on Czechoslovak and Polish personnel in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's inspection teams are a serious violation of the obligations undertaken by the U.S. military in Korea and a violation of basic international practice.

    The Supervisory Commission emphasized the seriousness of the provocative actions that have recently occurred in South Korea. In a statement issued by its Czechoslovak, Polish, Swiss and Swedish members, the commission unanimously expressed its concern about events that threaten the safety of some of its members, and requested the "Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces" to take action to prevent these events.

    The Czechoslovak government, in accordance with the wishes of the Czechoslovak people, most strongly condemns the attacks on the personnel of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The U.S. government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences of the attacks on Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel, because, as a signatory to the Korean Armistice Agreement, it has a responsibility to ensure the safety of Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel in the territory under the control of its armed forces. The U.S. government's current responsibility is to prevent the Syngman Rhee authorities from carrying out further provocative activities against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel, and to take measures to ensure that the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its inspection teams are unimpeded.

    The Czechoslovak government is deeply convinced that maintaining the Korean armistice is a fundamental condition for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and for further strengthening peace and security in Asia and the world, and therefore it remains determined to fulfill the obligations it undertook when participating in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

### 捷克斯洛伐克政府发表声明  谴责对中立国监察委员会人员的挑衅袭击

    捷克斯洛伐克政府发表声明
    谴责对中立国监察委员会人员的挑衅袭击
    【新华社布拉格讯】捷克斯洛伐克通讯社六日消息：捷克斯洛伐克政府就朝鲜中立国监察委员会人员最近遭到挑衅袭击一事发表声明。声明全文如下：
    捷克斯洛伐克人民在听到关于李承晚当局最近几天在南朝鲜港口对在朝鲜的中立国监察委员会中的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰人员进行了若干次袭击的消息时极为愤慨。这些袭击变得如此严重，以致它们直接威胁了这个委员会中的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰人员的人身安全和生命。李承晚最近的这些挑衅行动的目的是想使在南朝鲜港口的视察小组无法进行工作，同时破坏监察委员会的活动，而根据停战协定条款的规定，委员会是被指定担负防止朝鲜境内军事行动的恢复这一重要任务的。
    对中立国监察委员会人员的袭击，在日内瓦会议结束以后即告增加起来，这并不是偶然的。由于印度支那停火协定的签订，以及由于在印度支那问题的解决上达成协议，和平的力量已经获得了一个重大的胜利。美国的侵略集团在日内瓦遭到了一个新的惨败。这就是他们狂怒而加紧努力在亚洲制造新的战争中心的原因。
    最近对在南朝鲜的监察委员会人员的恐怖袭击是和最近美国在中国海南岛附近的挑衅行动有密切的关系的，并且也是和在东南亚及西太平洋订立一个侵略条约的新的努力，和李承晚在美国国会所发表的好战声明，以及和美国官员对中华人民共和国和其他亚洲国家的越来越多的口头攻击有密切的关系的。
    这些行动乃是企图阻止国际紧张局势的缓和、进一步威胁亚洲的和平和安全并阻挠用协商和协议的办法来解决一切争端的表现。
    参加日内瓦会议的美国代表团的态度又一次地证明了美国的侵略势力是反对和平统一朝鲜并反对把停战转变为永久和平的。美国统治集团为了保持南朝鲜作为对亚洲大陆发动一次新侵略的战略基地，几个月来一直在竭力企图解散这个重要的国际机构——朝鲜中立国监察委员会。他们为了追求他们的侵略目的，正在违反停战协定，尤其是用非法运入战争物资和武装李承晚的军队以进行新的军事冒险的方法来违反停战协定。特别是由于捷克斯洛伐克和波兰的代表们所进行的工作，监察委员会曾数次公布了在朝鲜的美军方面一再违反停战协定条款的事实。从中立国监察委员会成立的时候起，美国统治集团就企图用一切可能的办法来破坏这个委员会的威信和活动，其中的一种办法就是散布对委员会里捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员的毫无根据的指责。他们现在又一次地企图破坏这个委员会的活动，煽动李承晚的特务人员攻击委员会的委员们。美国统治集团这样做是企图除去他们所不需要的见证人，以便使他们能随心所欲地在南朝鲜建立他们的侵略基地。世界舆论不可能对这些对朝鲜中立国监察委员会人员越来越多的攻击置之不理，因为这个委员会活动的中断即意味着严重地违反了停战协定的条款。对中立国监察委员会视察小组中的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰人员的诽谤和野蛮的攻击，是严重违反朝鲜美军方面所承担的义务的行为，并且是违反基本的国际惯例的。
    监察委员会强调指出最近在南朝鲜发生的挑衅行动的严重性，委员会在它的捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、瑞士和瑞典委员发表的声明中一致表示对于威胁到它的某些委员的安全的一些事件感到不安，委员会并要求“联军司令部”采取行动，阻止这些事件。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府按照捷克斯洛伐克人民的愿望，最强有力地谴责对朝鲜中立国监察委员会的人员进行的袭击。美国政府必须对中立国监察委员会人员遭受袭击的一切后果负全部责任，因为，作为朝鲜停战协定的签字国，它有责任保证在它的武装部队控制的土地上的中立国监察委员会人员的安全。美国政府当前的责任就是阻止李承晚当局对中立国监察委员会的人员再进行挑衅活动，并且采取措施，保证中立国监察委员会和它的视察小组的活动不受阻碍。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府深信维持朝鲜停战是和平解决朝鲜问题和进一步加强亚洲以及全世界的和平和安全的一个基本条件，因此它仍旧决心履行它在参加中立国监察委员会时所承担的义务。
