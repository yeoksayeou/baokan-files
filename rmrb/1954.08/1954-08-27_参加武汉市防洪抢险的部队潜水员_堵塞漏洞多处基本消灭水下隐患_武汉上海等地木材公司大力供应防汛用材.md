Military Divers Participating in Flood Control and Rescue in Wuhan
    Block Multiple Leaks, Essentially Eliminating Underwater Hazards
    Timber Companies in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Other Places Vigorously Supply Flood Control Materials
    Naval and Railway Corps divers of the People's Liberation Army have made significant contributions to flood prevention and rescue efforts in Wuhan. They successively rescued two dangerous situations at Wuhan Customs and Hanyang Gate. In a comprehensive inspection of the underwater parts of the river embankment, they plugged dozens of leaks, essentially eliminating hidden dangers.
    Many underground pipelines and sewer gates along the river in Wuhan pose significant difficulties for flood control. Severe underground water leakage occurred at Wuhan Customs and Hanyang Gate in mid-August, with floodwaters briefly inundating nearby streets. During the rescue at Wuhan Customs, Tang Shusen, a Railway Corps diver, worked continuously underwater for six hours, single-handedly using over two hundred burlap sacks to block a large hole. He released the air from his diving suit and used the pressure of his body to compact the soil in the sacks. When he came out of the water, his arm was swollen by more than an inch, but he said, "This is a major matter related to the safety of Wuhan City; a little tiredness doesn't matter." During the rescue at Hanyang Gate, two naval diving teams and one Railway Corps team dove to the inner opening of the riverbed, twelve meters deep, but the current was too swift to work. They then dove to the outer opening, six meters deep, and blocked the hole with over a hundred burlap sacks, immediately causing the water in the street's manholes to recede. They then sealed off the two branches of the channel with cement and cotton, eliminating the dangerous situation. During this comprehensive inspection of potential embankment hazards, Wang Quanchen, a Railway Corps diver, discovered at the Qingdao Road intersection that a sewer gate was covered with silt and tangled wood. He immediately devised a way to remove these debris, working underwater for six consecutive hours, finally using cotton to block the leaks in the gate and preventing flooding of the road surface. On the 18th, naval divers discovered an unclosed gate near Wuhan Customs and used more than seventy burlap sacks to seal the gate. (Report from Wuhan Reporter Station of this newspaper)

    A naval diving team of the People's Liberation Army, participating in the flood control struggle at the Jingjiang Dam in Shashi, Hubei, has made 28 underwater explorations of dangerous situations in recent days, providing reliable data for flood control and future annual maintenance work. The divers explored dangerous areas with rapid currents and many whirlpools. In some places, the current speed was over three meters per second, making it difficult to dive to the bottom and stand firm. The divers released the air from their diving suits to reduce buoyancy, and when encountering whirlpools, they clung to anything they could to avoid being swept away by the water and continued to work. When diver Cai Shixiong was exploring the Baotahe Jitou in Shashi, he dropped sharply by nineteen meters in a dozen seconds after releasing the air from his diving suit. The increased water pressure caused congestion in his eardrums. However, after a short rest on shore, he requested to return to work immediately. After completing its mission, this diving team will return to Wuhan City within days to participate in the flood control struggle.

    Since the rise of the Yangtze and Huai rivers, branches of the China Timber Company have overcome all difficulties and vigorously supplied flood control materials to local areas. Staff members of the Wuhan Timber Company, undaunted by danger, actively measured and delivered flood control materials in storms and heavy rain. They also transferred 180 cubic meters of oak from Beijing to meet urgent flood control needs. The Wuhu Timber Branch Company measured and delivered 4,300 fir logs for flood control in the stormy and rainy Yangtze River overnight, promptly meeting the needs of dyke protection and rescue efforts. The Luohe Timber Management Office in Henan Province, after receiving a telegram from the Huai River Control Headquarters requesting 5,000 pilings, organized processing overnight in the wind and rain because they were not available at the time. They completed the processing and supply of 5,000 pilings in one day and one night. In order to quickly supply 6,000 fir logs needed by the Shanghai Purchasing Station of the China National Goods Company to rescue materials in the Pudong warehouse, staff members of the Shanghai Timber Company forgot to eat and rest and worked diligently to inspect and deliver until two o'clock in the morning. These efforts played a significant role in overcoming floods and ensuring the safety of national construction and the lives and property of the people.
    In addition to instructing and urging various localities to vigorously supply flood control materials, the China Timber Company also organized the storage of some timber in advance, preparing to supply it to disaster victims for repairing houses after the water recedes. (Zhang Guangfu)

    参加武汉市防洪抢险的部队潜水员
    堵塞漏洞多处基本消灭水下隐患
    武汉上海等地木材公司大力供应防汛用材
    人民解放军海军与铁道兵潜水员在武汉市防汛抢险中作出了重大贡献。他们先后抢救了武汉关与汉阳门两处险情，并在全面检查沿江堤防水下部分中，堵住了数十处漏洞，基本上消灭了隐患。
    武汉市沿江的地下管道与下水道闸门很多，给防汛造成很大困难。武汉关与汉阳门均在八月中旬发生地下冒水的严重险情，洪水曾一度漫及附近街道。在抢救武汉关险情时，铁道兵潜水员唐树森下水连续工作六小时，一人用两百多个麻包将一个大洞口堵住，并放出潜水衣内的空气，用身体的压力将麻包内的泥土压紧。他出水时手膀肿了一寸多高，但他说：“这是关系武汉市安全的大事，累点不要紧。”在汉阳门抢险中，海军两个潜水组与铁道兵一个组都先后沉下十二公尺深的江底内口处，但水流太急实在无法工作，他们又下到六公尺深的外口处，用一百多个麻包堵住洞口，街上围井内的水便立即消退。他们又用水泥和棉絮将两股叉道塞死，消灭了这处险情。在这次全面检查堤防隐患中，铁道兵潜水员王全臣在青岛路口发现下水道闸门已被淤泥和乱木遮住，他即设法将这些杂物清除，一连在水下工作六小时，终于用棉花将闸门漏口堵塞，制止了洪水浸到路面的现象。海军潜水员十八日又在武汉关附近查出一个闸门未关住，先后用了七十多个麻包将闸门堵死。（本报武汉记者站）

    赴湖北沙市参加荆江大堤防汛斗争的人民解放军海军的一个潜水组，连日下水探察险情二十八次，为防汛和今后岁修工作提出了可靠的资料。潜水员探察的多是江水急流、漩涡很多的险要地方，有的地方每秒钟流速达三公尺以上，不易潜到水底站稳，潜水员们便排出潜水衣内的空气，减少身体浮力，遇到漩涡就攀住可能攀到的东西，不使自己被水冲走，而能继续坚持工作。潜水员蔡式熊在沙市宝塔河矶头探察时，由于排出了潜水衣内的空气，在十几秒钟内急骤下降十九公尺，水压增大一倍，造成两耳鼓膜充血，但他上岸休息一会后，仍要求立即参加工作。这个潜水组在完成任务后，日内即将回到武汉市，参加防汛斗争。

    自江、淮水位上涨以来，中国木材公司的分支机构，克服了一切困难，大力供应当地防汛用材。武汉木材公司的职工，不畏艰险，在暴风疾雨中，积极量交防汛用材，并从北京调去柞木等一百八十立方公尺，供应了防汛紧急需要。芜湖木材支公司在狂风暴雨的大江中，连夜量交防汛所用的杉木四千三百根，及时供应了护堤抢险的需要。河南漯河木材经营处，在接到治淮指挥部电示需用五千根桩木后，因当时没有，便连夜冒着风雨，组织加工，以一天一夜的时间，完成了五千根桩木的加工供应任务。上海市木材公司为了迅速供应中国百货公司上海采购站抢救浦东仓库物资所需的六千根杉木，职工们忘了吃饭和休息，一直紧张地检交到深夜两点钟，任务完成后才罢手。这些，对战胜洪水、确保国家建设和人民生命财产的安全，都起了很大的作用。
    中国木材公司除指示和督促各地大力供应防汛用材外，并事先组织储备部分木材，准备在水退后供应灾民修缮房屋。（张光孚）
