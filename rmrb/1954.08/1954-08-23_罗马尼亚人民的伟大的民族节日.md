    The Great National Holiday of the Romanian People
    By Yoan Kishenievsky, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party,
    First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania
    August 23rd is the greatest day in Romanian history. On this day, Romania was liberated by the glorious Soviet army; the patriotic forces of the people, led by the Romanian Workers' Party, overthrew the fascist autocracy.

    Under the victorious advance of the Soviet army, the patriotic forces led by the Romanian Workers' Party successfully implemented the plan formulated by the Romanian Workers' Party, which was to overthrow the fascist government and, regardless of the resistance of the king and the heads of the bourgeois-landlord parties, establish armed forces against Hitler and participate in the international anti-fascist struggle.

    Immediately after August 23, 1944, the Romanian army fought side by side with the Soviet army not only within Romania but also in the liberation campaigns of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The heroism of the Romanian divisions was commended more than once in the orders of the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Union.

    August 23, 1944, marked the beginning of a fundamental change in our country's life, a transition from the bourgeois-landlord regime—a regime of cruel exploitation and bloody oppression of the working masses—to a people's democratic regime. In this transition, the working people took their destiny into their own hands, became the true and sole masters of the country, and the creators of a new free life—a life without exploitation and oppression, enjoying material and cultural welfare.

    In the past, our country's policies and economic destiny often depended on foreign imperialism. Our main wealth was often plundered by foreign trusts colluding with domestic capitalists; while the broad masses of the people lived in extreme poverty.

    Having defeated the conspiracies of reactionary groups attempting to maintain imperialist rule in our country and prevent the masses from fighting for democratic reforms, the Romanian people, with confident creative power, resolutely embarked on the path pointed out by the Workers' Party—the path of democracy and socialism.

    In the ten years since liberation, the Romanian people, under the leadership of the Party, have implemented great revolutionary changes. Because the Party led the establishment of an alliance between the working class and the working peasants, a social force capable of overcoming the resistance of the exploiting classes has been created. Under the leadership of the working class, the broad masses of peasants carried out a land reform beneficial to the working peasants in a revolutionary manner. Thanks to the mass struggle led by the Party, the reactionary government of Rădescu, supported by US-British imperialism, was overthrown, and a democratic government dominated by the working class was established.

    The further development of the mass struggle led to the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the Romanian People's Republic—the state of the working people themselves. The foundation of this people's democratic state is the alliance of workers and peasants under the leadership of the working class. As stated in the Constitution of the Romanian People's Republic, the Romanian People's Republic is a state of working people in urban and rural areas, and its purpose is to eliminate the exploitation of man by man, build socialism, and ensure the continuous satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of the working people. The people's democratic regime practices democracy for the broad masses of the people, while suppressing the fierce resistance of the remnants of the exploiting classes supported by aggressive imperialist groups. The people's democratic regime guarantees our country's national independence.

    The summary of the great achievements of the Romanian liberation in the past decade vividly demonstrates the great construction power of the people who have rid themselves of the shackles of exploitation and taken their destiny into their own hands.

    The nationalization of industry, transportation, and banks has promoted the strong development of industrial production. In the era of the people's democratic regime, industrial production has increased to more than 2.5 times that of 1938; new industrial sectors, primarily machine manufacturing, electrical industry, and chemical industry, have been established. Now our country is producing various types of tractors, electric motors, oil and mining equipment, complex equipment for the chemical industry, ocean-going vessels, ball bearings, etc. Our country now produces all the oil and mining equipment needed, as well as most of the equipment necessary for the development of consumer goods industry and agriculture.

    Our power industry has also undergone strong development. The ten-year electrification plan for our country, proposed by the Romanian Workers' Party, is being successfully implemented. The "Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej" thermal power plant, "Ovidiu II," "Red Flag," Moldova's giant thermal power plant, the "Moroni" hydropower station, and other power stations have been completed and have begun supplying electricity. The construction of the Lenin Hydropower Station in Bicaz is underway.

    The Danube Bridge connecting Romania and Bulgaria—aptly named "Bridge of Friendship"—was completed thanks to the strong assistance of the Soviet Union and the significant contributions of some people's democratic countries. This event is a new testament to the fraternal cooperation between the countries of the democratic camp.

    In the era of the people's regime, the consumer goods industry has been continuously developing. The production of shoes, sugar, flour products, and cooking oil has increased.

    The working class, which suffered exploitation and oppression in the past, has become the leading force in the country. The new attitude of the working class towards labor can be illustrated by the following: in the enthusiastic socialist labor competition, the number of skills, rationalization proposals, and technological innovations proposed by workers in the first half of 1954 reached 12,000. The average income of workers is increasing year by year. Our country spends hundreds of millions of lei on social insurance every year, and workers now enjoy free medical assistance for illnesses. Hundreds of thousands of workers take vacations in the mountains or at the seaside at public expense. A wide path of learning culture and art has been opened up for the working class.

    Under the democratic people's regime, the lives of the working peasants have also undergone tremendous changes. The elimination of the landlord class, the distribution of landlords' land to landless and land-poor peasants, the state's assistance to the working peasants in various forms such as agricultural machinery and tractors, seed selection, agricultural technical assistance, low-interest loans, and industrial products, and the policy of restricting rich peasants have all significantly improved the living standards of the working peasants.

    Many working peasant households have organized collective farms and cooperatives on a voluntary basis. Currently, there are nearly 4,400 collective farms and cooperatives in our country's agriculture. The Party and the government strongly assist collective farms and cooperatives in order to consolidate them economically and organizationally, and to develop them into large producers of commodity grains, vegetables, meat, milk, eggs, and wool. As a result of the demonstration work and convincing examples provided by collective farms—the vast majority of which have achieved far greater harvests per hectare than individual peasant households—the number of requests to establish new collective farms and cooperatives is constantly increasing.

    One of the most outstanding achievements in agriculture is the continuous increase in the supply of tractors and various agricultural machines. In 1938, there were only 4,859 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower) in agriculture, while now there are nearly 25,000 such tractors. There are now 220 machine tractor stations serving collective farms, cooperatives, and individual working peasants.

    The achievements made in the development of various sectors of the national economy in the ten years since our country's liberation are due to the implementation of the Party's policies by the urban and rural working people. The main content of this policy is concern for continuously improving the material and cultural standards of the people.

    At present, while continuing to appropriately develop heavy industry, the Party and the government are mobilizing the working people to fulfill the tasks put forward by the August 1953 plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party. This task is to eliminate agricultural backwardness, vigorously increase the harvest of agricultural products, and develop the consumer goods industry in order to improve the living standards of the working people in a short period of time.

    Developing agriculture and rapidly increasing agricultural products is the task of the entire people. In 1954, state budget appropriations for the development of agriculture increased by 75 percent compared to 1953. Many metallurgical enterprises have undertaken the task of producing a large number of agricultural machines and tools and parts needed for agriculture.

    The people's democratic government is extremely concerned about increasing the output of grains, vegetables, and livestock of individual working peasants, and has adopted a policy of material encouragement such as the use of state contracts and state purchases, as well as agricultural and livestock technical assistance, loans, and the promotion of advanced working methods in agriculture and the dissemination of the experience of advanced agricultural workers among the working peasants.

    The state's assistance to collective farms and cooperatives has been greatly strengthened. The Party and the government are particularly concerned about the construction work of collective farms, while conducting extensive political activities to establish new collective farms and cooperatives on a voluntary basis. The Party opposes any tendency to let things drift in the socialist transformation of the countryside.

    The draft directives of the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party on the further development of agricultural production in 1955-1956 stipulate the need to utilize new farmland to expand our country's arable land and to strive for higher yields of agricultural and livestock products.

    The Party is very concerned about the further development of the consumer goods industry. In 1954, investment in the consumer goods industry increased by 66.7 percent compared to 1953. Due to the measures taken by the Party and the government, the production of major consumer goods has increased significantly in the nine months since the August 1953 plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party. For example, the production of bread increased by 4.8 percent, flour products by 7.2 percent, canned meat by 21.8 percent, meat products by 18.6 percent, confectionery by 41.8 percent, and zinc furniture by 42.5 percent.

    In order to greet the anniversary of liberation and in response to the call of the staff of thirteen advanced enterprises in Bucharest, the broad masses of workers, technicians, and engineers are enthusiastically engaged in socialist labor competition. The purpose of this competition is to complete the tasks of this year's plan, not only in quantity, but also in other aspects—labor productivity, quality, variety, and cost; and not only to utilize new investment, but also to focus on discovering and utilizing the existing potential of each enterprise. The Party is leading the working people to fight for improving the utilization of production equipment in industrial enterprises and machine tractor stations, for implementing a strict system of economy and increasing labor productivity, and for increasing the production of agriculture and consumer goods.

    Marxist-Leninist theory holds that socialism is the conscious creation of the broad masses of the people, and that socialism can only triumph when the masses who possess a thousand times more power than before are in the struggle to establish political power and a new economic life. The people's regime is particularly committed to realizing the cultural revolution and creating a new socialist culture. The first task in this regard is to eliminate illiteracy. Over the years, the Party and the people's democratic government have achieved great success in eliminating the ruling evils left behind by the bourgeois-landlord regime in this area. In the 1954-1955 academic year, the last group of illiterates in our country will all enter literacy classes.

    The entire education system has been built on new foundations. True scientific content, as well as the combination of practice and the specific needs of building socialism, has become the basic principle in the entire educational process of schools and educational institutions. In the era of the people's democratic system, universal primary compulsory education has been implemented. The number of seven-year schools has now increased nearly six times compared to 1938. The number of students in these schools is four times that of the time. Vocational schools, secondary technical schools, and higher education have also undergone tremendous development.

    In the past, most secondary and higher education institutions were established for the children of the exploiting classes. Now, the vast majority of students in our country are the children of the working people.

    The Party and the government pay great attention to improving the educational level of students, further improving school education, improving the professional skills of education workers and thoroughly reforming them, and stabilizing their careers.

    In the past, science and technology were used to strengthen the exploitation of the working people and to make the exploiters richer. Now, they have become a powerful weapon for the working people to strive for the victory of socialism and the welfare of the working people. The Party has opened up broad creative prospects for scientific workers and has created unprecedented possibilities for them to explore our country's endless natural wealth and turn this wealth into useful materials.

    One of the most important achievements in the development of science is the expansion of the research worker contingent. In addition to scientists who have long been engaged in scientific activities and have made achievements, thousands of young research workers have been trained under the Party's persistent efforts, and they have actively participated in solving many problems in socialist construction.

    A convincing proof of the great achievements made in science and technology is the National Science Awards awarded by the state every year in this regard. The recently announced list of National Science Awards includes many works that have enriched science and technology and made important contributions to the further development of industry and agriculture. The Party has been leading scientists to thoroughly study the concepts of dialectical materialism and to closely link their research work with practical life. Now, it is more important than ever to enable science to solve the urgent requirements of life in a timely manner.

    In our country, a new literature and art, inspired by the struggles of the masses and serving the construction of socialism, is developing. With the principled and sympathetic support of the Party, the writers and artists of the Romanian People's Republic are enriching our country's cultural heritage every year with new and valuable works. These works describe the thoughts and feelings and struggles of our people, and describe the new problems in building socialism. Our people attach great importance to Mihail Sadoveanu's "Mitrea Cocor" and "Nicoară Potcoavă", Camil Petrescu's "Man Among Men", Peter Dumitriu's "June Night", Mihail Davidoglu's "Fortress of Flames" and "Exchange of Honors", and the collections of poems by A. Toma, M. Beniuc, Dan Deșliu, Eugen Jebeleanu, and Eugen Frunză. In addition to these names that have long been known and loved by the people, there have also been many new writers whose works have been valued and loved by the people.

    Significant achievements have also been made in the fields of drama, painting, sculpture, composition, and film. In the past, there was no film production center in Romania. Now, with the establishment of film studios, large films such as "Mitrea Cocor", "Descendants of the Buglers", "The Sun Rises", "Living in Victory", "In Our Village", and "Echoes in the Valley" have been produced.

    The entire art and literary activity is advancing along the path of socialist realism, and in the struggle against the remnants of bourgeois ideology, such as formalism and ignoring political tendencies.

    Culture has increasingly become the property of the broad masses. Many people's libraries have been established. Our country has established many clubs, cultural palaces, reading rooms, and "red corners"…. The works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are being published in large quantities. Romanian classical works, masterpieces of world literature, and works by Soviet writers and writers from various people's democratic countries have been published. In 1953 alone, more than 2,800 kinds of books were published, with a circulation of more than 47 million copies. The total circulation of books published in the past five years has exceeded 250 million copies, which is a very large number for our country.

    In the era of the people's regime, the Yo. Vi. Stalin - Spark Mansion Printing Factory and the Romanian People's Republic Opera and Ballet Theatre have been built. The construction of some film production centers and other cultural buildings is underway, and these buildings are something that our people are proud of.

    The people's democratic system pays special attention to improving healthcare. Now, malaria and other infectious diseases have been eradicated. Workers enjoy free medical care. The current number of clinics has tripled compared to 1948. The number of beds in maternity hospitals has doubled compared to 1948. The number of doctors has increased fourfold compared to 1944.

    The seasonal sanatoriums and resorts that were only available to the exploiting classes in the past are now completely enjoyed by manual or intellectual laborers. This year, 375,000 working people and 125,000 children will rest in some of the best health and fountain resorts in our country.

    Today, the working people enjoy the broadest democratic rights and freedoms, and this is precisely the manifestation of the most profound democracy of our people's democratic system.

    The strength of the people's democratic country is rooted in the consciousness of the masses and their active participation in the management of public affairs. In the Romanian People's Republic, 135,000 workers are representatives of the People's Congress, tens of thousands of workers are people's jurors (judges), and tens of thousands of workers work in the People's Congress Executive Committees, residential and street committees. Therefore, the broadest masses actively participate in the management of public affairs and the leadership of the country.

    Strengthening the people's democratic regime, which is the main tool for building socialism and improving the living standards of the working people, is a matter that the Party has always been concerned about.

    As an active participant in the democratic and socialist camp, the Romanian people are fully engaged in the peaceful cause of building socialism. The Party and the government of the Romanian People's Republic, embodying the people's ardent desire for peace, are implementing a foreign policy of defending peace, maintaining friendly unity with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all people's democratic countries, and maintaining friendship and peace with all peace-loving peoples.

    Establishing an unbreakable alliance and fraternal friendship with the great Soviet Union, the liberator of our country, is the foundation of the foreign policy of the Romanian People's Republic. The Romanian people fully understand that the Soviet Union's multifaceted generous assistance has always been a guarantee of our country's national independence and the victorious construction of socialism. Our people recognize the great Soviet socialist power as the leading force of the democratic camp, and this country is setting an inspiring example for the entire democratic camp and the working people of all countries in its brilliant achievements on the road to building communism and in its persistent struggle to strive for peace among all nations.

    At the same time, the Romanian people have also established unbreakable fraternal friendship with the People's Republic of China and all other people's democratic countries. The great Chinese people shattered the chains of colonial enslavement, liberated themselves from the rule of landlords, compradors, and the corrupted Kuomintang clique fostered by imperialism, and established the People's Republic of China, a great world power. The Romanian people also cheer and celebrate this.

    The achievements made by the Chinese people in building a new, free, and happy life are being closely watched and admired by our people. The best sons and daughters of the Romanian people have always sympathized with the Chinese people. Almost three centuries ago, the Romanian geographer, historian, and diplomat Nicolae Milescu was sent by Russia to participate in a diplomatic mission to China. He wrote many books about the lives of the Chinese people, Chinese villages and towns, and the national organization of China at that time. Nicolae Milescu sympathetically described the Chinese people's desire to live in harmony with their neighbors and their longing for peace, and said that "there is nothing more important in the world than this."

    Today, in Romania, People's China is known and loved by the people. Every achievement of China is seen as an achievement of our country. The Romanian people are eagerly watching the great achievements made by the Chinese people in implementing their first five-year plan. The works of Mao Zedong, as well as many works by Chinese writers such as Lu Xun, Ding Ling, and Zhou Libo, have been published and distributed in large quantities in our country. Our people also love Chinese movies, and in addition to their own national songs and Soviet songs, they also sing songs from China and other people's democratic countries.

    This new type of relationship established between the Soviet Union, our country, and other countries of the democratic camp has become one of the most important factors in the further development of our national economy and the socialist construction work in various people's democratic countries.

    The technical and scientific cooperation agreement signed between the People's Republic of China and the Romanian People's Republic provides strong proof of the mutual benefit arising from the brotherly cooperation between our two countries. The continuous development of economic and cultural exchanges between the Romanian and Chinese people, the increasing consolidation and development of friendship among all peace-loving countries headed by the great Soviet Union, is an important factor in the struggle to defend peace. In addition to continuing to develop and expand economic relations with various democratic countries, Romania is also developing its economic relations with capitalist countries. In 1953, it exchanged goods with more than forty capitalist countries.

    Like other peace-loving peoples, the Romanian people believe that determining the rights of the People's Republic of China as one of the world's major powers is a major issue in defending peace in Asia and the world.

    The birth and consolidation of the people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia is a historical reality. Faced with this reality, all the conspiracies of the US aggressive bloc are doomed to failure. Never in history has there been such a powerful united force as the great democratic and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The fact that 900 million people are united under the same banner of peace and democracy has a huge impact on the entire international situation. While the aggressive bloc finds itself increasingly isolated, millions of people in the capitalist world are increasingly actively supporting the policies of peace and international cooperation advocated by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various people's democratic countries.

    In celebrating the tenth anniversary of the liberation of the motherland, the Romanian people are summing up their achievements and proclaiming our determination to carry out the cause of building socialism and more actively defending peace to the end.

    罗马尼亚人民的伟大的民族节日
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局委员
    罗马尼亚部长会议第一副主席  约·基辛涅夫斯基
    八月二十三日是罗马尼亚历史上最伟大的日子。在这一天，罗马尼亚被光荣的苏联军队所解放；罗马尼亚工人党所领导的人民爱国力量推翻了法西斯的专制。
    在苏联军队胜利前进的形势下，罗马尼亚工人党所领导的爱国力量，成功地实现了由罗马尼亚工人党所制订的计划，这个计划就是推翻法西斯政府，和不顾国王与资产阶级—地主政党的首脑们的反抗，建立反对希特勒的武装力量和参加国际反法西斯的斗争。
    紧接着一九四四年八月二十三日以后，罗马尼亚军队不仅在罗马尼亚境内，而且也在匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克的解放战役中和苏联军队并肩作战。罗马尼亚师的英勇，在苏联最高统帅的命令中曾经不止一次地受到表扬。
    一九四四年八月二十三日这一天，标志着我国生活中的一个根本转变的开始，一个从资产阶级地主政权——残酷的剥削与对劳动群众血腥压迫的政权——到人民民主政权的转变。在这个转变中，劳动人民掌握了自己的命运，成为国家的真正唯一主人和新的自由生活——一种没有剥削与压迫、享有物质与文化福利的生活——的创造者。
    过去，我国的政策与经济命运，经常取决于外国帝国主义。我国的主要财富常被与国内资本家们相勾结的外国托辣斯所掠夺；而广大的人民群众却生活在极端的贫困之中。
    由于击败了企图在我国维持帝国主义统治与阻止群众争取民主改革斗争的反动集团的阴谋，罗马尼亚人民以充满信心的创造力量，坚决地走上了工人党所指出的道路——民主和社会主义的道路。
    解放十年来，罗马尼亚人民在党的领导下，实行了伟大的革命变革。由于党领导建立了工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，已产生了能战胜剥削阶级反抗的社会力量。在工人阶级的领导下，广大农民群众以革命方式实行了有利于劳动农民的土地改革。由于党领导的群众斗争，受到美英帝国主义支持的勒狄斯库反动政府被推翻了，一个民主的、工人阶级占优势的政府产生了。
    人民群众斗争的进一步发展，便废除了君主制度，而建立了罗马尼亚人民共和国——劳动人民自己的国家。这个人民民主国家的基础，就是在工人阶级领导下的工农联盟。正如罗马尼亚人民共和国宪法中所记载的，罗马尼亚人民共和国为城乡劳动人民的国家，它的目的即在消灭人剥削人、建设社会主义和保证不断地满足劳动人民的物质与文化需要。人民民主政权对广大人民群众实行民主，同时镇压由侵略成性的帝国主义集团所支持的剥削阶级残余的猛烈反抗。人民的民主政权保证着我国的民族独立。
    罗马尼亚解放十年来伟大成就的总结，生动地证明了摆脱剥削枷锁和掌握了自己命运的人民的巨大建设力量。
    工业、运输业和银行的国有化，促进了工业生产的强大发展。在人民民主政权的年代里，工业生产已比一九三八年增加到二点五倍以上；新的工业部门首先是机器制造业、电气工业和化学工业已经建立。现在我国正在生产着各种类型的拖拉机、电动机、石油和采矿设备、化学工业的复杂装备、远洋航轮和球轴承等等。我国现在生产着所需要的全部石油和采矿设备，以及消费品工业与农业发展所必需的大部分装备。
    我国的动力工业也有了强大的发展，由罗马尼亚工人党所提出的我国十年电气化计划，正在成功地实现着。火力发电站“乔治乌——德治”、“奥维底乌第二”、“红旗”、摩尔多瓦巨大火力发电站，“摩罗尼”水电站和其他的电力站已建筑完成，并已开始供电。贝卡兹的列宁水电站的建设工程正在进行。
    连接着罗马尼亚与保加利亚的多瑙河大桥——被恰当地称为“友谊之桥”，是由于苏联的大力援助和一些人民民主国家的重大贡献而建筑完成的。这件事情，是民主阵营各国之间兄弟般合作的新的证明。
    在人民政权的年代里，消费品工业有了不断的发展。鞋靴、糖、面粉制品和食油等的生产已经增加。
    过去遭受剥削与压迫的工人阶级，已成为国家的领导力量。工人阶级对待劳动的新的态度，可以从下列事情中得到说明：在热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛中，工人所提出的窍门、合理化建议和技术革新的数量，在一九五四年上半年已达一万二千件。工人的平均收入一年年地在增加着。我国每年要在社会保险事业上花费几亿列伊，工人们现在免费享受着医疗疾病的物质帮助。数十万工人利用公费在山间或海滨休假。在工人阶级面前已经展开了学习文化艺术的广泛道路。
    在民主的人民政权下，劳动农民的生活也起了巨大的变化。地主阶级的消灭，地主的土地分配给无地和少地的农民，国家以农业机器与拖拉机、选种、农业技术援助、低利贷款和工业品等各种形式给与劳动农民的帮助，以及限制富农的政策，都使得劳动农民的生活水平有了显著的提高。
    许多劳动农户已在他们自愿的基础上组织了集体农庄和共耕社。现在，我国农业中已经有将近四千四百个集体农庄和共耕社。党和政府大力援助集体农庄与共耕社，以便在经济上与组织上巩固它们，使它们发展成为商品谷物、蔬菜、肉类、牛奶、鸡蛋和羊毛的大量生产者。由于集体农庄—这些农庄绝大部分已在每公顷土地上得到远比个体农户为多的收获物—提供了示范的工作和令人信服的例证的结果，现在提出建立新的集体农庄和共耕社的要求的数目，正在不断增加着。
    农业的最突出的成就之一，是拖拉机和各种农业机器供应的不断增加。一九三八年，在农业中只有四千八百五十九架拖拉机（以十五匹马力计算），而现在已拥有将近两万五千架这类拖拉机了。为集体农庄、共耕社和为个体劳动农民服务的机器拖拉机站，现在已达二百二十个。
    我国解放十年来在国民经济各部门发展的道路上所取得的成就，是由于城乡劳动人民贯彻了党的政策，这一政策的主要内容，就是对于不断提高人民的物质与文化水平的关怀。
    目前，在继续适当地发展重工业的同时，党和政府正在动员劳动人民实现一九五三年八月罗马尼亚工人党中央全会所提出的任务。这个任务就是要消除农业的落后、大力提高农产品的收获量和发展消费品工业，以便在短期内提高劳动人民生活水平。
    发展农业和迅速增加农产品是全体人民的任务。一九五四年国家预算中对发展农业的拨款，比一九五三年增加了百分之七十五。许多冶金企业已承担了生产大量农业机器和农业所需的工具与零件的任务。
    人民民主政府极为关怀增加个体劳动农民的谷物、蔬菜和牲畜的产量，并为此而采取了利用国家合同与国家收购以及农畜技术帮助、贷款和在劳动农民中推广农业的先进工作方法与传播农业先进工作者的经验等物质鼓励的政策。
    国家对集体农庄和共耕社的帮助，已经大大地加强了。党和政府所特别关怀的是集体农庄的建设工作，同时进行广泛的政治活动，以便在自愿的基础上建立新的集体农庄和共耕社。党反对在农村的社会主义改造事业中的任何任其自流的倾向。
    罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会关于在一九五五—一九五六年进一步发展农业生产的指示草案中，规定要利用新的农田以扩大我国的可耕地，和争取农产品与畜产品的更高产量。
    党十分关怀消费品工业的进一步发展。一九五四年对消费品工业的投资比一九五三年增加了百分之六十六点七。由于党和政府所采取的措施，在一九五三年八月罗马尼亚工人党中央全会以后的九个月中，主要消费品的生产量增加了很多。例如面包的生产增加了百分之四点八，面粉制品——百分之七点二，罐头肉——百分之二十一点八，肉类制品——百分之十八点六，糖果点心——百分之四十一点八，锌制家具——百分之四十二点五。
    为了迎接解放日和响应布加勒斯特十三个先进企业工作人员的号召，广大的工人群众、技术人员和工程师们，正在热烈地进行着社会主义劳动竞赛。这个竞赛的目的是为了完成本年度计划的任务，不仅要在数量上完成，而且也要在其他方面——劳动生产率、质量、品种与成本等方面完成；不仅要利用新的投资，而且特别要着重于发掘和利用各企业所存在的现有的潜力。党正在领导劳动人民为改进对工业企业和机器拖拉机站的生产设备的利用，为实行严格的节约制度和提高劳动生产率，以及为增加农业与消费品的生产量而斗争。
    马克思列宁主义理论认为，社会主义是广大人民群众的自觉的创造，只有在建立政权与新的经济生活的斗争中拥有较前多千百倍的群众时，社会主义才能取得胜利。人民政权特别致力于实现文化革命和创造新的社会主义文化。这方面的第一个任务是扫除文盲。这些年来，党和人民民主政府在扫除由资产阶级—地主政权在这方面所遗留下来的统治恶果的工作中，已获得了巨大的成绩。在一九五四—一九五五学年，我国的最后一批文盲，将全部进入识字班学习。
  整个教育制度已建立在新的基础上了。真正的科学内容，以及和实践与建设社会主义的具体需要的结合，已成为学校和教育机关整个教育进程中的基本原则。在人民民主制度的年代里，已实施了普及初等义务教育制。七年制学校的数目，现在已比一九三八年增加了将近六倍。这些学校中的学生数目则已为当时的四倍。职业学校、中等技术学校和高等教育，也有了巨大的发展。
    过去，大部分中等和高等学校都是为剥削阶级的子女们开办的，现在，我国绝大多数的学生都是劳动人民的儿女。
    党和政府极为注意学生教育程度的提高、学校教育工作的进一步改进、教育工作干部业务的提高和彻底改进，以及他们的职业的固定化。
    过去，科学和技术是用以加强对劳动人民的剥削，并使剥削者更加发财致富的，而现在，它们已成为劳动人民争取社会主义胜利和劳动人民福利的强有力的武器。党为科学工作人员开辟了广阔的创造远景，并为他们建立了探查我国无尽的天然财富、并把这些财富变成有用物质的前所未有的可能性。
    在发展科学方面最重要的一项成绩，是研究工作者队伍的扩大。除了已长期从事于科学活动并有功绩的科学家以外，在党的坚持努力下，已培养了数千名年轻的研究工作者，他们都积极地参加了解决社会主义建设中许多问题的工作。
    在科学和技术方面已获得巨大成就的一个令人信服的证据，就是国家在这方面每年所颁发的国家奖金。在最近公布的国家奖金名单中有不少丰富了科学和技术、并对进一步发展工业和农业作出重要贡献的著作。党一直在领导科学家来透澈研究辩证唯物主义的概念，并使他们的研究工作和生活中的实践密切联系起来。现在，使科学能及时解决生活中的迫切要求，已比任何时候更为重要了。
    在我国，从人民群众的斗争中吸取灵感、并为建设社会主义服务的一种新的文学和艺术，正在发展起来。在党的有原则性的和同情的支持下，罗马尼亚人民共和国的作家和艺术工作者每年都在用新的有价值的作品丰富着我国的文化遗产。这些作品描述了我国人民的思想感情和斗争，描述了建设社会主义中的新的问题。我国人民非常重视米哈伊尔·萨多维亚努著的“米特里亚·柯果尔”和“尼考拉·波特科娃”，卡米尔·佩特雷斯库著的“人群中的人”，彼得·杜米特里乌著的“六月之夜”，米海尔·达维多格鲁著的“火焰的堡垒”和“荣誉的更替”，以及亚·托马，米·贝纽克，邓·德什里乌，尤琴·耶勃里亚努，尤金·佛朗查等人的诗集。除了这些长期以来便为人民所知晓和热爱的名字以外，也出现了不少的、他们的作品已受到人民重视和喜爱的新作家的名字。
    在戏剧、绘画、雕刻、作曲、电影等部门也获得了重大的成绩。过去，在罗马尼亚没有电影制片中心。现在，由于建立了电影制片厂，于是像“米特里亚·柯果尔”、“号手的子孙”、“太阳升起了”、“生活在胜利”、“在我们村庄里”、“山谷中的回响”等大型影片都制造出来了。
    整个艺术和文学活动都是沿着社会主义现实主义的道路，并在和资产阶级思想的残余，如形式主义，不问政治倾向等作斗争中前进的。
    文化已日益成为广大群众自己的东西。许多人民的图书馆已经建立。我国已设立了很多俱乐部、文化宫、阅览室和“红角”……。大量发行着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作。已经出版了罗马尼亚的古典作品，世界文学名著和苏联作家以及各人民民主国家作家们的作品。仅在一九五三年便出版了二千八百多种书，发行量在四千七百万册以上。近五年来所出版书籍的总发行量已超过二亿五千万册，对我们国家来说，这是一个很大的数字。
    在人民政权年代，已经兴建了约·维·斯大林—火花大厦印刷工厂和罗马尼亚人民共和国歌剧和巴蕾舞剧院。一些电影制片中心和其他文化建筑物的建筑正在进行中，这些建筑都是我国人民所引以为荣的。
    人民民主制度特别注意保健事业的改进。现在，疟疾和其他传染病已绝迹了。工人享受到免费医疗。目前的诊疗所比一九四八年增加了三倍。产科医院的床位比一九四八年增加了一倍。医生人数较一九四四年增加了四倍。
    在过去只供剥削阶级享用的季节疗养所和休养地，现在已完全由体力或脑力劳动者享用。今年就有三十七万五千劳动人民和十二万五千儿童到我国一些最好的保健和喷泉疗养所中休憩。
    今天，劳动人民已享受到最广泛的民主权利和自由，而这正是我国人民民主制度最深刻的民主性的表现。
    人民民主国家的所以强大是根源于群众的自觉，和他们的积极参加公共事业的管理。在罗马尼亚人民共和国内，有十三万五千名工人是人民会议的代表，有好几万工人是人民的陪审员（审判员），另外有好几万工人则在人民会议执行委员会、居民和街道委员会中工作。因此，最广大的群众都积极参加了公共事业的管理和领导国家的工作。
    加强作为建设社会主义和提高劳动人民生活水平的主要工具的人民民主政权，是党所一直关心的问题。
    罗马尼亚人民作为民主和社会主义阵营的积极参加者，正以全力从事建立社会主义的和平事业。党和罗马尼亚人民共和国政府，体现着人民对和平的热烈愿望，实行着保卫和平，与苏联、中华人民共和国及所有人民民主国家保持友好团结的外交政策，以及同所有爱好和平的人民保持友谊与和平的政策。
    和我国的解放者——伟大的苏联建立牢不可破的联盟和兄弟般的友谊，是罗马尼亚人民共和国外交政策的基础。罗马尼亚人民完全懂得：苏联给我国的多方面的慷慨帮助，一直是使我国民族独立和胜利建成社会主义的保证。我国人民把伟大的苏维埃社会主义强国认作是民主阵营的领导力量，这个国家正以它在建设共产主义道路上的辉煌成就和在争取各国人民间的和平的坚持不懈的斗争中，为整个民主阵营和世界各国劳动人民树立了令人鼓舞的榜样。
    同时，罗马尼亚人民也和中华人民共和国，以及其他所有人民民主国家建立了牢不可破的兄弟友谊。伟大的中国人民粉碎了殖民主义的奴役的锁链，把自己从地主、买办和受帝国主义豢养的、腐化的国民党集团统治下解放了出来，并建立了中华人民共和国这一伟大的世界强国。对此，罗马尼亚人民也欢呼庆贺。
    中国人民在建设新的、自由与幸福生活中所取得的成绩，正受到我国人民的关切和敬佩。罗马尼亚人民最优秀的儿女们一直是同情中国人民的。差不多在三世纪以前，罗马尼亚的地理、历史学家兼外交家尼古拉耶·米里修，曾受俄国派遣，参加了一个前往中国的外交使团。他写了不少有关中国人民的生活，中国的村镇和当时中国的国家组织的著作。尼古拉耶·米里修同情地记述了中国人民希望同邻国和睦相处的愿望和他们渴望和平的愿望，并说“世界上再没有比这更重要的了。”
    今天，在罗马尼亚，人民中国为人们所熟悉和热爱。中国的每项成就被看作是我国的成就一样。罗马尼亚人民正热切注视着中国人民在实行第一个五年计划中所获得的巨大成就。在我国已出版，并大量发行着毛泽东的著作，以及鲁迅、丁玲、周立波等中国作家的许多作品。我国人民也喜爱中国电影，并且除了自己民族的歌曲和苏联歌曲外，也唱着中国和其他人民民主国家的歌曲。
    苏联、我国以及其他民主阵营国家之间所建立的这种新型关系，已成为我国国民经济的进一步发展和各人民民主国家中社会主义建设工作的一项最重要的因素。
    中华人民共和国同罗马尼亚人民共和国所签订的技术科学合作协定，提供了我们两国兄弟合作所产生的互利的有力证明。罗马尼亚和中国人民之间的经济和文化交流的不断发展，以伟大苏联为首的所有爱好和平国家之间的友谊的日益巩固与发展，是保卫和平斗争中的一个重要因素。除了继续发展和扩大同各民主国家的经济关系以外，罗马尼亚也正在发展它和资本主义国家的经济关系。在一九五三年内，它曾和四十个以上的资本主义国家进行了货物交换。
    罗马尼亚人民正如其他爱好和平人民一样，认为确定作为世界大国之一的中华人民共和国的权利，是保卫亚洲和世界和平的一个主要问题。
    欧洲和亚洲各人民民主国家的诞生和巩固，是一个历史的现实。在这个现实面前，美国侵略集团的一切阴谋是注定要失败的。历史上还从未有过像以苏联为首的伟大民主与社会主义阵营这样强大的联合力量。九亿人民团结在和平与民主的同一面旗帜下的这个事实，在整个国际局势中发生着巨大的影响。当侵略集团发现自己日益孤立的时候，千百万资本主义世界的人民却愈益积极地来支持苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家所主张的和平与国际合作的政策。
    在庆祝祖国解放十周年之际，罗马尼亚人民正在总结着自己的成就，并宣告我们要把建设社会主义和更积极地保卫和平的事业进行到底的决心。
