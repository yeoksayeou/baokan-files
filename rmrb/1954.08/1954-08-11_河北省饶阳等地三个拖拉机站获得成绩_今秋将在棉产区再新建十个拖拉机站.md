The three tractor stations established in Raoyang County, Jin County, and Ninghe County, Hebei Province, this spring have achieved great success. During the spring plowing season, these three stations cultivated more than 5,200 mu of land for thirteen agricultural production cooperatives and also used seeders to sow 91 mu of cotton, sorghum, corn, and other crops on a trial basis. The Lutai Town Station in Ninghe County also helped various cooperatives thresh more than 140,000 jin of wheat. After the tractor stations cultivated the land for the cooperatives, a large amount of labor was saved and put into land processing. After the Lutai Town Station in Ninghe County implemented mechanized farming for seven cooperatives, it saved 5,500 man-days, reclaimed more than 150 mu of wasteland, and also opened irrigation canals, turning 72 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Crops on land cultivated by machines generally grew well. In the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wugong Village, Raoyang County, cotton plants cultivated by tractors were one chi tall, with an average of eight fruiting branches and fifteen buds per plant; while cotton plants cultivated by animal power were only eight cun tall, with an average of seven fruiting branches and ten buds per plant. At the same time, the use of mechanized farming further promoted the consolidation and development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Some members of the Geng Changsuo cooperative originally wanted to withdraw, but after seeing the benefits of mechanized farming, no one wanted to withdraw. Since this spring, the number of farm households participating in agricultural production cooperation in the fourth district of Raoyang has increased from 13 percent of the total number of farm households to 40 percent. Recently, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry convened a meeting of tractor station chiefs, summarized and inspected the work of the first half of the year, and formulated a preliminary autumn operation plan. Based on the spring operation, the plan calls for expanding the autumn plowing area by 28,000 mu and sowing 2,000 mu of wheat.

In order to increase the production of more cotton and grain to support national construction, the province will build ten new agricultural machine tractor stations in cotton-producing areas such as Handan, Xingtai, and Shijiazhuang, where mutual aid and cooperation foundations are relatively good and land is concentrated, before the autumn plowing this year. Preparations for the construction of the stations are currently underway, and it is planned to cultivate 4,000 mu of land for local farmers during the autumn plowing season.

    河北省饶阳等地三个拖拉机站获得成绩
    今秋将在棉产区再新建十个拖拉机站
    河北省今春在饶阳县、晋县、宁河县建立的三个拖拉机站，已获得很大成绩。这三个站在春耕中给十三个农业生产合作社代耕了五千二百多亩地，还试用播种机播种了九十一亩棉花、高粱、玉米等。宁河县芦台镇站还帮助各社脱粒了十四万多斤小麦。拖拉机站给各社代耕以后，节省了大批劳动力，投到土地加工上。宁河县芦台镇站给七个社实行机耕后，节省出五千五百个人工，开垦了一百五十多亩荒地，还开了水渠，把七十二亩旱地变成了水田。实行机耕的土地作物一般都生长良好，饶阳县五公村耿长锁农业生产合作社，用拖拉机耕种的棉株高一尺，平均每株有八个果枝，十五个蕾；而畜力耕种的棉株只有八寸高，平均每株有七个果枝，十个蕾。同时使用机耕后更促进了互助合作组织的巩固和发展，耿长锁社原来有些社员想退社，看到机耕的好处后，再也没有想退社的了。饶阳四区今春以来参加农业生产合作的农户由占总农户的百分之十三增加到百分之四十。最近该省农林厅召开了拖拉机站站长会议，总结和检查了上半年的工作，并初步制定了秋季作业计划。计划在春季作业的基础上，扩大秋耕面积两万八千亩，并播种两千亩小麦。
    为了增产更多的棉、粮支援国家建设，该省将于今年秋耕前在互助合作基础较好，土地集中的邯郸、邢台、石家庄等棉产区新建十个农业机器拖拉机站。目前正在积极筹备建站工作，准备在秋耕时，给当地农民代耕四千亩土地。
