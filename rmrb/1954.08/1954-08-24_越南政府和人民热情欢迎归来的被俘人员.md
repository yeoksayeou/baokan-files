On August 18th, from early morning, thousands of people from nearby areas came here with flags. At 4 p.m., the ships carrying prisoners of war and detained civilians docked.

    越南政府和人民热情欢迎归来的被俘人员
    【新华社二十三日讯】　据越南通讯社中越二十二日讯：最近由法方移交的越南人民军战俘和被拘平民，受到了越南民主共和国政府和人民的热情欢迎。
    在中越北部清化省岑山，当地政府和人民在海岸上组织了一个集会，欢迎回来的战士和平民。八月十八日，从清晨起，附近地区的成千上万的人民就拿着旗子到这里来。下午四时，载着战俘和被拘平民的船只靠岸了。站在岸上和渔船上的人们纷纷向回来的战士和平民招手欢迎。回来的战士和平民同人民一起高呼“胡志明主席万岁！”“和平胜利万岁！”
    法国方面所移交的战俘和被拘平民控制不住自己的感情，眼泪从颊上流下来。其中大多数人都很瘦弱，并且患着疾病，但是他们看到自己恢复了自由，眼中闪耀着高兴的光芒。
    越南人民军的医务工作人员亲切地询问了被移交回来的战士和平民的健康情况。
