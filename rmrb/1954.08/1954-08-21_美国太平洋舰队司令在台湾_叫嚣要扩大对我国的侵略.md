    Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Stump, who secretly went to Taiwan to conduct conspiracies, left Taiwan for Manila on the 19th. According to Western news agencies, Stump, at a press conference held before leaving Taiwan, brazenly clamored to use "all necessary force under his command" to prevent the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan, and threatened to expand the aggressive actions against China. Stump also revealed that the U.S. military "aid" advisory group stationed in Taiwan will soon be under the unified command of the Pacific Fleet Command. Before leaving Taiwan, Stump also held secret talks with Chiang Kai-shek. According to Agence France-Presse, the talks are related to the conspiracy being planned between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek to include some of the coastal islands of China occupied by Chiang Kai-shek within the scope of the U.S. Seventh Fleet's activities.

    叫嚣要扩大对我国的侵略
    【新华社二十日讯】秘密到台湾去进行阴谋活动的美国太平洋舰队司令斯图普已在十九日离台湾去马尼拉。据西方通讯社报道，斯图普在离台湾前举行的记者招待会上狂妄地叫嚣要使用“在他指挥下的一切必要的力量”来阻止中国人民解放自己的领土台湾，并且威胁说要扩大对中国的侵略行动。斯图普还透露，美国驻台湾的军事“援助”顾问团将在最近由太平洋舰队司令部统一指挥。斯图普在离台湾前还和蒋匪介石进行了秘密会谈。据法新社报道，这次会谈和美蒋之间正在策划的把中国沿海蒋匪盘踞的某些岛屿包括在美国第七舰队的活动范围之内的阴谋有关。
