　　In the first half of this year, in conjunction with farming activities such as spring plowing and summer weeding, the People's Governments of Guizhou, Xikang, and Sichuan Provinces have distributed large quantities of free farm tools in ethnic minority areas. In Guizhou Province alone, 112,000 pieces of free farm tools have been distributed in minority areas, both concentrated and dispersed, in twenty-five counties including Liping and Rongjiang; it is expected that the distribution of free farm tools for the entire year will be completed by October. The People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has first distributed the free farm tools that were not distributed last year, and the newly manufactured farm tools this year are also being transported to various places for distribution. The Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has also distributed a batch of free farm tools, with more than 9,000 pieces distributed in Xide County alone. In Qiaoji Tibetan Autonomous Township in Baoxing County, more than half of the farmers have received free farm tools. This year, the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province will distribute free farm tools worth 2 billion yuan, of which the first and second batches have already been distributed.

　　Having received these free farm tools, ethnic minority farmers in various places are constantly changing their original backward methods of production. During spring plowing this year, farmers in fifteen counties including Leishan and Danzhai in Guizhou Province received more than 13,600 iron plows. With each iron plow plowing an average of ten mu of land, backward farming methods were changed on more than 136,000 mu of land. In the seventh district of Liping County, another 198 households learned to use oxen to plow the fields this year, changing the backward method of "foot treading." In Sanglang Township, Wangmo County, Miao farmers who had never seen iron plowshares before mostly received iron plowshares this year, and generally achieved three plowings and three harrowings. Farmers in Qiaoji Tibetan Autonomous Township, Baoxing County, Xikang Province, received iron hoes during summer weeding and immediately put down their wooden sticks, using iron hoes to weed, which greatly increased their enthusiasm for production and led them to formulate increased production plans. Yi farmers in Haha Autonomous Township, Mianning County, used iron hoes to weed out weeds this year, and the corn grew particularly luxuriantly.

    贵州、西康、四川三省发放大批无偿农具
    帮助少数民族农民改变落后的生产方法
    今年上半年，结合春耕、夏锄等农事活动，贵州、西康和四川三省人民政府在少数民族地区已发放大批无偿农具。贵州省仅在黎平、榕江等二十五个县的少数民族聚居或散居地区，已共发放无偿农具十一万二千件；预计到十月份可将今年全年的无偿农具发放完毕。西康省藏族自治区人民政府已先将去年未发放完毕的无偿农具发出，今年新打造的农具也正陆续运往各地发放。西康省凉山彝族自治区也发放了一批无偿农具，仅喜德县就发放九千多件，宝兴县的跷迹藏族自治乡，已有半数以上的农民领得了无偿农具。四川省藏族自治区今年要发放价值二十亿元的无偿农具，其中第一、二批已经发放完毕。
    各地少数民族农民领得了这些无偿农具，正在不断改变着原来落后的生产方式。今年春耕时，贵州省雷山、丹寨等十五个县的农民领得铁犁一万三千六百多件，平均每架铁犁犁地十亩，便在十三万六千多亩的土地上改变了落后的耕种方式；黎平县七区农民，今年又有一百九十八户学会了用牛耕田，改变了“脚踩田”的落后办法。望谟县桑郎乡，从来没有见过铁铧的苗族农民，今年大都领得了铁铧，普遍做到了三犁三耙。西康省宝兴县跷迹藏族自治乡的农民在夏季中耕时领得铁锄，立即放下了木棒，用铁锄薅草，大大提高了生产热情，纷纷订制了增产计划。冕宁县哈哈自治乡彝族农民，今年用铁锄锄净了杂草，玉米长得特别茂盛。
