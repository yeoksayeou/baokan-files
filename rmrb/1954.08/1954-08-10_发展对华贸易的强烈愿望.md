Strong Desire to Develop Trade with China
Du Hong

During the Geneva Conference, many representatives of industrial and commercial circles from Western capitalist countries contacted relevant personnel of the Chinese delegation, expressing their willingness to develop trade relations with China. They recognized that the People's Republic of China, which has begun large-scale economic construction, is not only an indispensable force in safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world but also in developing normal international trade.

China's five-year plan for national industrialization has attracted close attention from industrialists and businessmen in Western countries. Shortly after the start of the Geneva Conference, former British Labour government Trade Minister Wilson and Conservative MP Brown met with Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. They not only exchanged views on general Sino-British relations but also explored the possibility of further developing Sino-British trade. Subsequently, delegations from Italian industrial, commercial, and banking circles, representatives of the Dutch Foreign Trade Committee, delegations from Belgian manufacturers, importers, and exporters, as well as industrial and commercial representatives from West Germany, France, Switzerland, Finland, and other countries held talks with trade officials of the Chinese delegation. The five major industrial and commercial groups in Britain, including the Federation of British Industries, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the China Association, the National Union of Manufacturers, and the London Chamber of Commerce, jointly invited Chinese trade officials to visit Britain in June to discuss the development of normal Sino-British trade. After the Chinese trade delegation visited Britain, they also visited Belgium at the invitation of the Federation of Belgian Industries. After the Geneva Conference, Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade of China, visited Finland and held talks with Finnish government authorities on expanding Sino-Finnish trade. Both sides agreed to conclude a supplementary trade agreement outside the Sino-Finnish trade agreement for 1954 and to start negotiations on specific issues as soon as possible. In addition, industrial and commercial circles in some other Western European countries have also sent invitations to Chinese trade officials or prepared to send delegations to visit China.

These facts show the strong desire of Western capitalist countries to establish and expand trade with our country.

When the Chinese trade delegation to Britain visited the UK, they consulted with the Sino-British Trade Committee jointly organized by the five major industrial and commercial groups in Britain - the Federation of British Industries, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the China Association, the National Union of Manufacturers, and the London Chamber of Commerce - and the Sino-British Trade Promotion Association established after the Moscow International Trade Conference, as well as many British manufacturers who have maintained trade relations with China since the war, on the development of normal trade between China and Britain. Cao Zhongshu, head of the Chinese trade delegation to Britain, pointed out at a reception held by the Sino-British Trade Committee: according to China's current needs and supply situation, it is entirely possible to increase the volume of Sino-British trade to 80 to 100 million pounds in the coming year. The commodities that China needs to import are extremely wide-ranging and are all willing to be supplied by British industrialists and businessmen. Cao Zhongshu listed in detail the commodities China needed and their quantities, saying, "We need about 4 to 5 million pounds worth of chemical raw materials and dyes, 3 to 4 million pounds worth of fertilizers, and antibiotics alone for pharmaceuticals need 20 to 30 million pieces, and there is also a large demand for rayon and wool tops. Other traditional British export commodities such as electrical equipment, steel, and hardware (including tinplate, steel plates, steel pipes, etc.) can trade at least 50,000 tons or more. In addition, locomotives, trucks, and small cargo ships are all needed by China." It can be seen that the commodities needed by China and that British manufacturers can supply include not only steel and machinery for industrial construction but also daily consumer goods necessary to meet the people's rising living standards.

The British "Financial Times" wrote in an editorial on June 4: "China's development will provide a natural market for British goods. At the same time, China can expand the scope of the commodity market, allowing British merchants to buy and sell in these markets under the most favorable conditions." An article entitled "Trade with China" published in the British magazine "New Statesman and Nation" on July 17 raised the question: If we supply China with the goods it needs, what will China supply us? The magazine replied: "The conclusion is that Britain's immediately feasible imports from China can reach 38 million to 50 million pounds, mainly including five categories of commodities: eggs and egg products 8 million to 10 million pounds; vegetable oil 8 million to 10 million pounds; soybeans 6 million to 8 million pounds; bristles and textile raw materials 8 million to 10 million pounds; and other goods 6 million to 8 million pounds...This will save Britain a considerable amount of U.S. dollar foreign exchange." The magazine urged British exporters to sign specific contracts with China immediately, without delaying waiting for export permits.

Industrialists and businessmen in Britain and other Western European countries are deeply aware of the approaching American economic crisis and are unwilling to continue to follow the economic policies of the United States. They are eager to find their own way out, and therefore are redoubling their efforts to open up channels for East-West trade.

It is worth noting that the activities of Western countries' industrialists and businessmen eagerly seeking to develop trade with China are being carried out under the circumstances that the United States continues to adhere to its embargo policy against China. This shows that the US embargo policy against China has suffered a shameful bankruptcy.

It is well known that the US embargo policy has caused enormous damage to its so-called allies. Just a few examples will prove this point.

In an analysis of Sino-British trade relations, a booklet published by the British Committee for the Promotion of International Trade, "British Foreign Trade," stated: "Goods shipped from the United Kingdom and Hong Kong to China totaled US$226,000,000 in 1950; US$288,000,000 in 1951; US$104,000,000 in 1952; and increased slightly in 1953 to US$112,000,000. During the same period, exports from China to the United Kingdom remained relatively stable, averaging US$170,000,000 per year. The sharp decline in British trade with China is primarily a direct result of the US embargo policy.

Other capitalist countries have similar situations. The Indonesian "Independent" once made a simple statistic on May 18, 1953: "Indonesia has lost trade with the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries due to the US embargo policy, resulting in a loss of 300 million US dollars. During the same period, Indonesia received only 16 million US dollars from US aid."

The economic damage caused by the US embargo policy to capitalist countries has caused increasingly widespread and fierce opposition in various countries' public opinion. At the 18th session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, representatives from Britain, India, Argentina, Belgium, and other countries unanimously called for the abolition of restrictions that hinder the normal development of East-West trade. The French "Le Monde" wrote: "Western European countries are increasingly determined to demand that the United States abolish the appalling and abnormal restrictions stipulated in the US Battle Act, which aims to undermine trade between capitalist countries and countries of the democratic camp." The British "Tribune" also wrote: "It should be firmly declared that the Americans have no right to try to restrict our trade." Jookewang, chairman of the Economic Committee of the Indonesian Parliament, recently stated that the embargo should be ended in order to establish normal trade relations with China and other countries. He further said that Indonesia should take the initiative to raise the issue of lifting the embargo at the United Nations. Even some people in the Philippines, which is controlled by the United States, have expressed dissatisfaction with the US embargo policy. Philippine Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Shia publicly criticized the US embargo policy and demanded the development of trade relations with China. According to a broadcast from Manila on July 15, Shia declared that if Magsaysay allowed a trade delegation to visit China, he would be prepared to lead the delegation. A considerable number of merchants in the United States also hope to restore normal trade relations with China. According to a survey result published by an American exporter publication reprinted by the "New York Times" on December 11, 1953, the participants included 576 export companies with a total annual export trade of 1.5 billion US dollars. Among them, 361 managers, or 62 percent, expressed their desire to restore normal trade with China. The "New York Herald Tribune" published an article on July 19 entitled "West Germany's Trade with China," saying: "The issue of trade with Red China, which has already caused sharp criticism from the United States to Britain, may become the source of friction between the United States and West Germany...Currently, West Germany, the economically strongest country in continental Europe, intends to greatly promote trade with China...This desire has been further encouraged by the recent announcement in London that a strong trade delegation will be sent to the Chinese capital this autumn." The author of the article, Gaston Coblentz, wrote: "German industrialists and businessmen, almost without exception, are fiercely critical of the obstacles imposed by the United States on trade with China." In Britain and other Western European capitalist countries, there is an increasingly fierce demand to abolish the embargo policy imposed on them by the United States.

The "Manchester Guardian" wrote on July 19: "British Trade Minister Thorneycroft suggested amending the policy of the allies when he visited Washington last month. The Fifteen-Nation Joint Committee will reconvene in Paris on the 19th. The meeting may agree to remove certain items from the prohibited export list. If this is the case, this not only means a concession to Western manufacturers seeking markets, but it may be an acknowledgment that the effect of the embargo policy is very questionable." Industrialists and businessmen in Britain, West Germany, and other Western European countries can no longer wait for the lifting of the embargo policy and the relaxation of the embargo list, but immediately demand the establishment of trade ties with China, first studying the possibility of developing trade with China from the list of exportable commodities, so as to prepare conditions for the further large-scale development of trade with China once the embargo policy is lifted. The Geneva Conference not only achieved positive results in peacefully resolving the Indochina issue, further easing the tension in the Far East and internationally, but also provided a good start for the further development of East-West trade, including the development of trade relations between Western countries and China.

    发展对华贸易的强烈愿望
    杜宏
    在日内瓦会议期间，许多西方资本主义国家的工商界代表人物，曾经与中国代表团有关方面人员进行接触和联系，表示愿意与中国发展贸易关系。他们认识到业已开始大规模经济建设的中华人民共和国，不仅在保卫远东与世界和平方面，而且在发展正常国际贸易方面，都是一个不可忽视的力量。
    中国实现国家工业化的五年计划，吸引了西方各国工商业人士的密切注意。日内瓦会议开始后不久，首先是英国前工党政府贸易大臣威尔逊和保守党议员布朗会见了周恩来总理兼外交部长，他们不仅就一般的中英关系交换了意见，而且探讨了进一步发展中英贸易的可能性。之后，与中国代表团贸易方面人员进行了会谈的有意大利工商与银行界代表团，荷兰对外贸易委员会的代表，比利时制造商、入口商和出口商代表团，以及西德、法国、瑞士、芬兰等国的工商界代表。英国的工业联合会、全国总商会、中国协会、全国制造商联盟、伦敦商会等五大工商界团体并于六月间联合邀请中国贸易方面人员去英国参观访问，商谈发展中英正常贸易的问题。中国贸易访问团访问英国后又应比利时工业联合会的邀请访问了比利时。我国对外贸易部副部长雷任民在日内瓦会议结束后，并访问了芬兰，和芬兰政府当局就扩大中芬贸易问题进行了商谈，双方一致同意在一九五四年度中芬贸易协定以外商订补充贸易协议，并将尽速开始有关具体问题的商谈。此外，另外一些西欧国家的工商界，也向中国贸易方面发出了访问的邀请或准备派遣代表团到中国来访问。
    这些事实表明了西方资本主义国家对于建立和扩展对我国贸易的强烈愿望。
    中国赴英国贸易访问团在英国参观访问时，曾与英国的工业联合会、全国总商会、中国协会、全国制造商联盟、伦敦商会五大工商团体联合组织的中英贸易委员会及在莫斯科国际贸易会议之后建立的中英贸易促进会以及在战后一直与中国保持贸易关系的许多英国厂商，商谈了发展中英两国间正常贸易的问题。中国赴英国贸易访问团团长曹中枢在中英贸易委员会的招待会上指出：按照中国目前的需要和供应的情况来看，在今后一年内，中英贸易额增加到八千万到一亿英镑是完全可能的。中国需要进口的商品极其广泛，而且都是英国工商业家所愿意供应的。曹中枢并详细列举了中国所需要的商品及其数量，他说：“我们需要四、五百万英镑左右的化学工业原料和染料，三、四百万英镑的肥田粉，单是药品的抗生素一项便需要二千万到三千万支，人造丝和毛条亦大量需要。英国其他的传统的出口商品如电机设备、钢铁、五金（包括马口铁、钢板、钢管等），至少可做五万吨以上的交易。此外机车、卡车、小型货船等都是中国所需要的”。由此可见，中国需要的和英国厂商可以供应的商品，不仅是供工业建设的钢材与机器设备，而且也包括为满足人民生活水平日益提高所必须的日用消费品。
    英国“金融时报”六月四日的社论就写道：“中国的发展将为英国商品提供一个自然的市场。同时中国能够扩大商品市场的范围，使得英国商人可以在最有利的条件之下，在这些市场里面进行买卖。”英国“政治家与民族”杂志七月十七日刊载的“对中国的贸易”一文中提出这样的问题：如果我们供应中国所需要的商品，中国将供应我们什么呢？该杂志回答道：“结论是英国从中国即刻可行的输入可以达到三千八百万到五千万英镑，主要是包括五类商品：蛋与蛋品八百万到一千万英镑；植物油八百万到一千万英镑；大豆六百万到八百万英镑；猪鬃与纺织原料八百万到一千万英镑；以及其他货物六百万到八百万英镑……这将使英国节省了相当数量的美元外汇。”该杂志敦促英国出口商立刻与中国订立具体的合同，不要拖延等待输出许可。
    英国和其他西欧国家的工商业家已深深感到美国经济危机的临近，不愿再追随美国的经济政策，急欲自寻出路，因而加倍努力谋求打开东西方贸易的途径。
    值得注意的是：西方各国工商业家急切要求发展对中国的贸易的活动，是在美国继续坚持其对中国的禁运政策的情况之下进行的。这说明了美国对中国的禁运政策已经遭到了可耻的破产。
    人所共知，美国的禁运政策给予它的所谓盟国极其巨大的损害。随便举几个例子即可证明这点。
    英国促进国际贸易委员会出版的“英国对外贸易”一本小册子中在分析中英贸易关系时说：“从英国和香港输至中国的商品，一九五○年共为二二六、○○○、○○○美元；一九五一年共为二八八、○○○、○○○美元；一九五二年降至一○四、○○○、○○○美元；一九五三年稍有增加，共为一一二、○○○、○○○美元。同一时期内，自中国向英国的输出却相当稳定，平均每年为一七○、○○○、○○○美元。英国对华贸易额的锐减首先是美国禁运政策的直接结果。
    其他资本主义国家也有相仿的情况。一九五三年五月十八日印度尼西亚的“独立报”曾经作了一个简单的统计：“印尼由于美国的禁运政策，丧失了与苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家的贸易，结果损失三亿美元，同一时期，印尼从美援中只得到一千六百万美元”。
    美国禁运政策由于对于资本主义各国所造成的经济损害已经引起了各国舆论愈来愈普遍和激烈的反对。在联合国经济社会理事会十八届大会上，英国、印度、阿根廷、比利时及其他国家的代表们都一致要求取消妨碍东西贸易正常发展的限制。法国
  “世界报”曾写道：“西欧国家日益坚决地要求美国废除美国巴特莱法案所规定的旨在破坏资本主义国家与民主阵营国家间贸易的惊人反常的限制”。英国“先驱论坛报”也写道：“应该坚决地宣布美国人没有任何权力试图限制我们的贸易。”印度尼西亚国会经济委员会主席朱克望最近声明说：应该结束禁运，以便与中国及其他国家建立正常的贸易关系。他并进一步说：印尼最好采取主动，在联合国提出取消禁运的问题。连美国控制下的菲律宾的一部分人亦对美国禁运政策表示不满，菲律宾参议院商业委员会主席希亚公开抨击美国的禁运政策，并要求开展与中国的贸易关系。据马尼拉七月十五日广播说，希亚宣称：假若麦格赛赛准许贸易代表团访问中国，他准备领导这一代表团。美国国内亦有相当数量的商人希望恢复与中国的正常贸易关系。据“纽约时报”一九五三年十二月十一日转载美国出口商一出版物上发表的一个测验结果显示，参加测验的包括每年出口贸易总额达十五万万美元的五百七十六家出口公司，其中有三百六十一个经理，即百分之六二，表达了与中国恢复正常贸易的愿望。纽约“先驱论坛报”七月十九日刊载“西德对华贸易问题”一文说：“业已引起美国对英国尖锐批评的对红色中国的贸易问题，也许要成为美国与西德摩擦的根源。……目前在欧洲大陆经济上最强有力的西德的实业界，意欲大大推进对中国的贸易。……这一意愿由于伦敦最近发表于今秋派遣一强大的贸易代表团去中国首都的消息，受到更大的鼓励。”该文作者加斯顿·考布伦茨写道：“德国的工商业家，几乎是毫无例外，都是激烈地批评美国对中国贸易强加的障碍。”在英国及其他西欧资本主义国家都愈来愈猛烈地要求取消美国强加在它们身上的禁运政策。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”七月十九日写道：“英国贸易大臣桑尼克罗福特上月访问华盛顿时即建议修改盟国的政策。十九日十五国联合委员会在巴黎复会。会议可能同意从禁止输出的货单中划掉某些货品项目。如果是这样，这不仅意味着对于寻求市场的西方制造商的一个让步，这可能是承认禁运政策的效果很值得怀疑。”英国、西德及西欧其他各国的工商业家已经不能等待禁运政策的取消和禁运货单的放宽，而立即要求与中国建立贸易联系，首先从可以输出的商品货单中研究发展对中国贸易的可能性，从而为一旦禁运政策取消之后进一步地大量发展对中国的贸易准备条件。日内瓦会议不仅在和平解决印度支那问题上获得了积极的成果，进一步缓和了远东与国际的紧张局势，而且为进一步发展东西方贸易，包括发展西方各国与中国间的贸易关系提供了良好的开端。
