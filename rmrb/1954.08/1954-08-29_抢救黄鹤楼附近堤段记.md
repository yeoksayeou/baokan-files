A rescue of the embankment near the Yellow Crane Tower was completed in fifty minutes by the personnel participating in flood control in Wuchang. At 1:30 PM on the 24th, a section of the levee below the Yellow Crane Tower along the river in Wuchang, more than 20 meters long, suddenly collapsed into the river, including the waterproof wall and the sub-dike added inside the waterproof wall. The endangered levee body was only a few centimeters thick. The emergency signal flare summoned the flood control personnel who were ready to go at any moment. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Public Security Forces participating in flood control assembled its troops in five minutes and immediately ran from more than a thousand meters away. Construction workers, stevedores, civilian laborers, students, and residents participating in flood control also rushed to the scene. People carried sacks filled with fine sand and sacks filled with stones, as well as newly sewn yellow earth sacks, one after another, rushing to the endangered section of the dike. Shao Yipu, a soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, carried a sack of yellow earth weighing over a hundred pounds to the endangered area. Liu Hailong, a Communist Party member of a certain unit of the Public Security Forces, had broken and inflamed his left hand a few days ago while digging and ramming the earth, requiring three surgeries. His hand was still wrapped in gauze. This time, he also participated in the rescue, using his right hand to support carrying stones and sacks. In just fifty minutes, people reinforced the collapsed section of the dike with five layers of sacks. The raging Yangtze River flood was blocked outside the dike.

From 3 PM to late at night, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Liberation Army Public Security Forces threw stones into the river at both ends of the endangered section to increase the safety of the levee body. A certain unit of the Public Security Forces selected more than 30 soldiers, tied safety ropes around their waists, and jumped into the river to lay the stones and stone-filled sacks thrown down as a foundation, which consolidated the toe of the levee. Starting from the 25th, the construction of a second dike, 800 meters long, inside this section of the river dike also began.

By the 26th, the danger zone of this section of the levee body had been completely out of danger. Trucks were continuously transporting loads of yellow earth, and the flood control personnel were about to complete the construction of the second dike. This emergency was the first major danger to the river dikes of Wuhan City since the water level began to drop on August 19th; but it was quickly discovered, controlled, and overcome by the flood control fighters who had withstood two months of flood test. This incident alerted the flood control fighters to the period of flood decline.

    抢救黄鹤楼附近堤段记
    参加武昌防汛人员，用了五十分钟时间就把黄鹤楼附近沿江堤段的险情挽救过来了。那是二十四日下午一时半，武昌沿江黄鹤楼以下的一段堤线上，有二十多公尺长的防水墙和防水墙内培加的子堤突然向江里崩塌。岌岌可危的堤身只剩了几公寸厚。险情信号枪召唤着时刻整装待发的防汛人员。参加防汛的人民解放军公安部队某部在五分钟内就集合好了队伍，从一千几百公尺以外立即跑步赶到。参加防汛的建筑工人、搬运工人、民工、学生和居民也纷纷赶到了。人们扛着装满细砂的麻袋和装满石块的麻袋，扛着刚刚缝好的黄土麻袋，一个紧接一个地向出险堤段赶运着。人民解放军某部战士邵意谱，扛着一百几十斤重的黄土麻袋跑到出险地段。公安部队某部共产党员刘海龙，前些天挖土打夯把左手磨破发炎了，开了三次刀，手上还缠着纱布。这次他也参加了抢险，他用右手撑着担石头、扛麻袋。人们只花了五十分钟的时间，就在下塌的堤段里面培厚了五层麻袋。汹涌的长江洪水被挡在堤外了。
    从下午三时到深夜，人民解放军某部和人民解放军公安部队，又在出险堤段两端断面上向江底抛石块，以增加堤身的安全。公安部队某部挑选了三十多名战士，腰里系着安全绳，跳入江中，把抛下的石块和装石麻袋摆成基础，这就使抛下的石块巩固了堤脚。从二十五日起，这一段江堤里边的一条长八百公尺的第二道堤防也动工修筑了。
    二十六日，这一段堤身的出险区已经完全脱险了。载重汽车正把一车车的黄土源源运到，防汛人员已把第二道堤防快要筑成了。这次险情是武汉市沿江堤防从八月十九日水位降落以来的第一次大险；但很快就被经受了两个月洪水考验的防汛战士们发现了、制住了、战胜了。这一次险情，使防汛战士们在洪水下落时期引起了警惕。
