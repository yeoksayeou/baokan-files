New Conspiracy of US and Rhee Syngman Talks
　　Wu Quan
After the United States undermined the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, it is stepping up its collusion with the Rhee Syngman clique to block the road to resuming consultations, attempting to further undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement and threaten peace in Asia.
　　From July 27 to 30, US President Eisenhower and Rhee Syngman held talks. The joint communiqué made no secret of the fact that the talks were held in accordance with the "agreement" between US Secretary of State Dulles and Rhee Syngman in August 1953. Based on this one-sided "agreement" between the United States and the Rhee Syngman clique, the United States obstructed the convening of the Korean political conference and undermined the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference. Now they are unilaterally discussing the issue of "unifying" Korea and the issue of increasing US military and economic assistance to South Korea for war preparations. Therefore, the importance of this meeting lies in the fact that the United States and the Rhee Syngman clique have engaged in a new conspiracy. The conspiratorial purpose of this meeting is obvious. This has also been immediately proven by the facts.
　　The US-Rhee talks communiqué shamelessly stated that they would continue to adhere to the so-called illegal resolutions of the UN General Assembly on the Korean issue, and that Rhee Syngman would "unify" Korea; at the same time, they attempted to shirk the responsibility of the United States for undermining the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference. However, it is well known that this "intention" to "unify" Korea, which the US-Rhee talks "reaffirmed," is the unreasonable demand that the United States failed to achieve in the Korean War and attempted to force the Geneva Conference to accept. Its extremely absurd and arrogant nature has been thoroughly exposed at the Geneva Conference and has aroused condemnation from world public opinion. The reason why the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference failed to reach any agreement was precisely because the United States insisted on this unreasonable demand and refused to negotiate. The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union put forward a series of practical and feasible proposals, and strived to narrow differences and reach an agreement. Until a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue was impossible due to US obstruction, the delegations of North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union put forward various proposals to consolidate peace in Korea, but they were all rejected by the United States. The US delegation even recklessly rejected the final suggestion made by China's Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai that relevant countries should resume discussions on the Korean issue in the future. The United States cannot shirk the responsibility for undermining the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference in any way.
　　Although the Geneva Conference failed to reach an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the Korean issue has not been removed from the agenda. North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union have all expressed their serious position to continue to strive for a solution to the Korean issue through consultation, and Britain and other countries that participated in the Korean War have also expressed the hope that discussions on the Korean issue can be resumed. However, it is clear that the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue is fundamentally incompatible with the absurd demand for "unifying" Korea, which the United States insists on. Therefore, the unilateral decision made by the United States and the Rhee Syngman clique now exposes the US intention to tie the Korean issue into a dead knot, close the door to a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, in order to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice, and further prepare to resume the Korean War.
　　The US-Rhee talks joint communiqué stated that they discussed the "methods" to "continue to pursue" the "unification" of Korea by Rhee Syngman, but they dared not say it clearly. However, this is no longer a secret.
　　After the United States undermined the Geneva Conference on the discussion of the Korean issue, the Rhee Syngman clique has been clamoring that it is not bound by the armistice agreement and wants to "unify by force" Korea. This time, Rhee Syngman's war hysteria in Washington was even more arrogant. He demanded at a joint session of both houses of the US Congress that "the Korean armistice has expired," that the South Korean puppet army be doubled, and that the naval and air forces be increased to launch an attack on North Korea and China. He even demanded that a new world war be provoked, shamelessly saying: "The Korean battlefield only includes a small part of the war we want to win. The war we want to win is the war for Asia, the war for the world."
　　Rhee Syngman's bloody clamor was obviously over the top, and could not help but make his American master, who had just been battered and bruised on the Korean battlefield, feel a little embarrassed. Many relatively realistic members of the US Congress expressed "silence" on Rhee Syngman's clamor, and public opinion in many US allies, such as Britain and other countries, criticized it one after another. The British "Yorkshire Post" denounced Rhee Syngman as a "bloodthirsty person." However, Rhee Syngman received enthusiastic applause from the US war hawks, and people like Senator Wiley, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, could not help but praise Rhee Syngman's clamor as a "vigorous speech," saying that Rhee Syngman "is full of the ideals of Americans (referring to the American ruling group)." In fact, Rhee Syngman can indeed feel "satisfied" with this Washington meeting. Because many of the demands he made for restarting the Korean War were greatly satisfied.
　　The Rhee Syngman clique launched a series of terrorist atrocities endangering and threatening the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission at ports of inspection such as Busan, Incheon, and Gangneung, which immediately received the support of US Secretary of State Dulles. The Rhee Syngman clique's despicable acts in violation of the armistice agreement are an attempt to force the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to succumb to violence, abandon its sacred task of supervising the Korean armistice and maintaining world peace, in order to realize the US's conspiracy to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Dulles also openly said on August 3 that the United States intends to "dissolve" the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and repeated its old tune of slandering the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and smearing the North Korean and Chinese sides. It is very clear that the United States is the mastermind behind the incidents endangering the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. When Rhee Syngman government Prime Minister Byun Young-tae had to express his intention to stop this atrocity under the pressure of world public opinion, he still said triumphantly, "We Koreans (Rhee Syngman clique) can rest assured," because he said that the United States had assured them that it would find a way to dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.
　　The reason why the United States viciously slanders the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and wants to get rid of it as soon as possible is because the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's supervisory work in South Korea, although restricted and obstructed in every possible way and facing many difficulties, has repeatedly exposed the United States' violation of the armistice agreement by shipping in large quantities of reinforcing war materials, and has played a role in maintaining the implementation of the armistice agreement, so it is regarded as a thorn in the side by the United States. Now, the US-Rhee Washington meeting has made new plans to further increase military assistance to Rhee Syngman in order to expand the Rhee puppet army, so the United States is even more eager to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in order to clear the obstacles to expanding the army in South Korea. After attending the US-Rhee talks, UN Commander-in-Chief Hull admitted when he returned to Tokyo that "it has been agreed in Washington that the land, sea, and air forces of South Korea will be strengthened to a certain extent," so he expressed his agreement with Dulles's opinion on "dissolving" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.
　　Not only that, but Dulles's conspiracy to "dissolve" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is to further undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement and deepen the instability of the Korean armistice. As everyone knows, the US side has already undermined the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," making it impossible for the Korean political conference to be convened. Now, it is attempting to close the door to a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on the one hand, and to place the Korean armistice under a state of no international supervision on the other hand. It is not difficult to imagine what kind of situation the Korean armistice will be in. Dulles actually regards the people of the world as idiots, thinking that they cannot see how the United States is gradually undermining the armistice agreement. He actually hypocritically said that certain parts of the armistice "agreement may have become outdated or unworkable, and these parts can be invalidated without affecting the entire agreement"; at the same time, he shamelessly said that after the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is "dissolved," "the maintenance of the armistice conditions will depend on the sincerity of the UN Command," and the United States may have to "really abolish the armistice agreement." This very despicable and shameful argument proves that the Rhee Syngman clique's past and present demands to not be bound by the armistice agreement and to demand that "the Korean armistice has expired" are completely in line with the US State Department's conspiracy plan.
　　However, the Korean Armistice Agreement is a whole and cannot be divided. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission plays an important role in maintaining the armistice agreement, and the US side is not allowed to "dissolve" it. Dulles's attempt to raise the issue of dissolving the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission at the next UN General Assembly is illegal. Article 61 of the armistice agreement stipulates that "amendments and additions to this armistice agreement must be agreed upon by the commanders of the opposing sides," and the UN on one side of the belligerents has no right to intervene. The North Korean and Chinese sides have protested against the US-Rhee incidents endangering the personnel of the neutral nations at the Korean Military Armistice Commission meeting, and the four member states of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission have also jointly requested protection of their safety and work. All peace-loving people around the world support the just work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and oppose any destructive conspiracy by the US side.
　　It is no coincidence that the United States is holding US-Rhee talks at this time, stepping up new conspiratorial arrangements with the Rhee Syngman clique, attempting to dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and carrying out terrorist attacks on neutral nations inspection personnel. Although the United States undermined the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, an agreement has been reached on the restoration of peace in Indochina. The United States suffered new setbacks at the Geneva Conference, and the possibility of peaceful consultation to resolve other international issues, including the Korean issue, will greatly increase. As a result, the US ruling group stepped up military adventure preparations in South Korea, launched war hysteria, and increased the tense atmosphere in Korea, so as to cooperate with its formation of a Southeast Asia defense group, threaten peace in Indochina, and launch new provocations against the People's Republic of China, etc., in order to create tension in Asia and save its increasingly bankrupt "strength" policy.
　　It is particularly noteworthy that the new conspiracy being carried out by the United States to undermine peace in Korea, like its conspiracy to undermine peace in Southeast Asia, is inseparable from its policy of hostility and aggression against the People's Republic of China. When Dulles announced the conspiracy to dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, he openly said that the US government is not only negotiating with the Chiang Kai-shek remnants in Taiwan to establish a "formal joint defense alliance," but is also "studying" the formation of a "single alliance" by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. The purpose of Dulles's conspiracy is obviously to bring the Chiang Kai-shek remnants in Taiwan and the Rhee Syngman clique together to serve its policy of aggression against China and Asia.
　　All peace-loving people around the world and the Chinese people should closely watch the US's aggressive conspiracy activities. We resolutely stand with the Korean people and the people of Asia and other countries to continue to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, maintain the Korean Armistice Agreement, and be vigilant to give a strong counterattack to any adventurous actions by the United States at any time.

    美国和李承晚会谈的新阴谋
    吴全
    美国破坏了日内瓦会议谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的可能性后，正在加紧与李承晚集团共谋堵死恢复协商的道路，企图进一步瓦解朝鲜停战协定，威胁亚洲的和平。
    七月二十七日至三十日，美国总统艾森豪威尔和李承晚举行了会谈。会谈公报毫不掩饰这次会谈是按照一九五三年八月美国国务卿杜勒斯和李承晚的“协议”举行的。美国根据它和李承晚集团的这个片面的“协议”，阻挠了朝鲜政治会议的召开，破坏了日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，现在它们又片面地讨论了“统一”朝鲜的问题，和美国给南朝鲜增加军事经济援助以进行战争准备的问题。因此，这次会谈之值得重视，是在于美国和李承晚集团进行了新的阴谋。这次会谈的阴谋目的，是一目了然的。事实也立刻证明了这一点。
    美李会谈公报公然恬不知耻地表示仍要继续坚持所谓联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的非法决议，由李承晚“统一”朝鲜；同时并妄图推卸美国破坏日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论的责任。但是，人所共知，美李会谈“重申”的这个“统一”朝鲜的“意图”，就是美国在侵朝战争中所未能实现而企图强迫日内瓦会议接受的无理主张。它的极端荒谬和狂妄的性质，已在日内瓦会议上被彻底揭露，并引起了世界舆论的谴责。日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论所以未能达成任何协议，正是由于美国坚持这个无理主张，拒绝协商的结果。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、我国和苏联三国代表团曾提出了一系列切实可行的建议，并力求缩小分歧，争取达成协议。直至和平解决朝鲜问题因受美国阻挠而不可能取得结果时，朝、中、苏三国代表团又提出了巩固朝鲜和平的各项建议，但是，也竟被美国一一拒绝。美国代表团甚至不顾一切地拒绝了我国周恩来外长最后提出的有关国家应在今后恢复讨论朝鲜问题的建议。美国是无论如何也推卸不了这个破坏日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题的责任的。
    日内瓦会议虽然未能就和平解决朝鲜问题取得协议，但朝鲜问题并没有从日程上抹掉。朝、中、苏三国都已表示了要继续争取以协商方式解决朝鲜问题的严正主张，英国和其他一些侵朝国家也曾表示希望能够恢复朝鲜问题的讨论。但是，很显然，朝鲜问题的和平解决，是和美国所坚持的“统一”朝鲜的荒谬主张，根本不能相容的。因此，现在，美国和李承晚集团作出的片面决定，暴露出美国蓄意要把朝鲜问题打上死结，关死和平解决朝鲜问题的大门，以便维持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，并进一步准备恢复朝鲜战争。
    美李会谈联合公报说，它们讨论了“继续追求”由李承晚“统一”朝鲜的“方法”，但不敢明白说出来。不过，这早已不是什么秘密了。
    美国破坏了日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题的会议后，李承晚集团即一直大肆叫嚷不受停战协定的约束，要“以武力统一”朝鲜。这次李承晚在华盛顿的战争歇斯底里叫嚣，更是狂妄。他在美国国会两院联席会议上要求宣布“朝鲜停战已经寿终正寝”，把南朝鲜傀儡军扩充一倍，并增加海空军力量，向朝中两国发动进攻。他甚至要求挑起新的世界大战，无耻地说：“朝鲜战场只包括我们要赢得的战争的一小部分，我们要赢得的战争是争夺亚洲，争夺世界的战争。”
    李承晚的血腥叫嚣，显然叫得过头了，不能不使他的刚刚在朝鲜战场上碰得头破血流的美国主人感到有些狼狈。美国许多比较现实些的议员都对李承晚的叫嚣表示“沉默”，美国的许多盟国如英国和其他国家的舆论，更是纷纷加以指责，英国“约克郡邮报”痛斥李承晚为“嗜血者”。但是，李承晚却受到了美国的好战分子的热烈喝采，像参议院外交委员会主席维利之流就情不自禁地赞扬李承晚的叫嚣为“有魄力的演说”，说李承晚“充满了美国人（指美国统治集团）的理想”。实际上，李承晚对这次华盛顿会谈也的确是大可以感到“满意”的了。因为，他为了重新挑起朝鲜战争而提出的许多要求，得到了很大的满足。
    李承晚集团在釜山、仁川、江陵等视察口岸，连续发动危害和威胁中立国监察委员会人员的一系列恐怖暴行，就立刻得到了美国国务卿杜勒斯的支持。李承晚集团采取这种违反停战协定的卑鄙行径，是企图迫使中立国监察委员会屈服于暴力之下，放弃其监察朝鲜停战和维护世界和平的神圣任务，以实现美国破坏中立国监察委员会的阴谋计划。杜勒斯在八月三日也公开说，美国打算“解散”朝鲜中立国监察委员会，并重复其诽谤中立国监察委员会和诬蔑朝中方面的陈腔滥调。这就很显然，美国是这次危害中立国监察委员会人员的事件的主谋。李承晚政府总理卞荣泰在世界舆论压力下不得不表示停止这种暴行时，也仍然得意洋洋地说
  “我们朝鲜人（李承晚集团）可以放心了，”因为他说，美国已向他们保证设法解散中立国监察委员会。
    美国所以恶毒地诽谤中立国监察委员会，并要去之为快，是由于中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜的监察工作虽然横遭限制和阻挠，困难重重，但仍一再揭露了美国违反停战协定运进大批增援性作战物资的事件，对维护停战协定的实施起了作用，因而它就被美国视为眼中钉。现在，美李华盛顿会谈又为进一步增加对李承晚的军事援助，以扩充李伪军的计划，进行了新的策划，因而，美国就更加急于要取消中立国监察委员会，以便扫除南朝鲜扩军的障碍。联合国军总司令赫尔在参加美李会谈后返抵东京时，就承认“在华盛顿已经协议，南朝鲜的陆、海、空军将得到一定的加强”，所以，他表示同意杜勒斯“解散”中立国监察委员会的意见。
    不仅如此，杜勒斯阴谋“解散”中立国监察委员会的目的，是要进一步瓦解朝鲜停战协定，加深朝鲜停战的不稳定状态。大家知道，美国方面已经破坏了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，使朝鲜政治会议不得召开，现在又企图一面关死和平解决朝鲜问题的大门，一面使得朝鲜停战置于没有国际监督的状况下。这样，朝鲜停战将处于怎样的局面，是不难想像的。杜勒斯竟把天下人当作白痴，以为他们会看不见美国如何在逐步瓦解停战协定。他居然假惺惺地说停战“协定的某些部分可能已变得过时或行不通的了，这些部分可以作为无效，而并不影响整个协定”；同时他又无耻地说中立国监察委员会“解散”后，“停战条件的维持将决定于联合国军司令部的诚意”，而美国可能要“真的废除停战协定”。这种十分卑鄙可耻的论调，证明了李承晚集团过去和现在要求不受停战协定约束，要求“朝鲜停战已经寿终正寝”，正是完全与美国国务院的阴谋计划相吻合的。
    但是，朝鲜停战协定是一个整体，是不容割裂的。中立国监察委员会对维护停战协定有着重要的作用，更不许美方“解散”。杜勒斯企图在下届联大提出解散中立国监察委员会的问题，这是非法的。停战协定第六十一款中规定，“对本停战协定的修正和增补必须经敌对双方司令官相互协议”，交战一方的联合国无权干预。朝中方面已在朝鲜停战委员会会议上对美李危害中立国人员事件提出抗议，中立国监察委员会四国委员也联名要求保护他们的安全和工作。全世界爱好和平的人民都支持中立国监察委员会的公正工作，反对美国方面的任何破坏阴谋。
    美国在这个时候举行美李会谈，加紧和李承晚集团进行新的阴谋布置，企图解散中立国监察委员会，并对中立国视察人员施行恐怖袭击，这都不是偶然的。美国虽然在日内瓦会议上破坏了朝鲜问题的讨论，但恢复印度支那和平问题已取得协议，美国在日内瓦会议上遭到了新的挫败，和平协商解决其他国际问题包括朝鲜问题在内的可能性，将大大增长起来。于是，美国统治集团便加紧在南朝鲜进行军事冒险准备，发起战争歇斯底里叫嚣，增加朝鲜的紧张气氛，以便和它拼凑东南亚防务集团，威胁印度支那的和平，对中华人民共和国进行新的挑衅等等阴谋活动相配合，来制造亚洲的紧张局势，挽救它的日益破产的“实力”政策。
    特别值得注意的是，目前美国破坏朝鲜和平所进行的新阴谋，和它破坏东南亚和平的阴谋计划一样，都是同它敌视和侵略中华人民共和国的政策分不开的。杜勒斯在宣布解散中立国监察委员会的阴谋计划时，公开说美国政府不仅正在和台湾蒋介石残余匪帮谈判建立“正式的共同防御联盟”，而且正在“研究”由台湾蒋匪帮、南朝鲜和日本组成一个“单一的联盟”。杜勒斯的这个阴谋目的，显然是要把台湾蒋介石残余匪帮和李承晚集团拉在一起，为它的侵略我国和亚洲的政策服务。
    全世界爱好和平的人民和中国人民应密切注视美国的侵略阴谋活动。我们坚决和朝鲜人民及亚洲和各国人民一起继续争取和平解决朝鲜问题，维护朝鲜停战协定，并要提高警惕，随时给予美国的任何冒险行动以有力的反击。
