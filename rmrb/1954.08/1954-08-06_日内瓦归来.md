    Returning from Geneva
  　By Our Correspondent　Wu Wentao
    Three Days in Berlin
    When I and some comrades from the delegation left the airport and drove towards the city, flags were waving along the way. Although Premier Zhou's car had already passed, the welcoming crowds had not completely dispersed and were still waving enthusiastically at us. I noticed that at the very front of our vehicles was a lead car. It had a blue light on the left side of its front window. Without the need for horns or the shouts of traffic police, according to the sign of this blue light car, all vehicles automatically stopped at intersections or turns, allowing our vehicles to pass without any delay. The conscious organization and work efficiency of the general people of the German Democratic Republic were evident everywhere.
    From Geneva to East Berlin, one immediate difference I felt was that there were bustling tourists on the streets in Geneva, while here there were mostly laborers rolling up their sleeves, rebuilding the capital of their country. I remember when I first arrived in Berlin in the spring of 1950, Unter den Linden in the city center was still scarred with war. The street that had been renamed "Stalin" was still full of ruins. But now, not only are those linden trees, resembling poplars but with leaves longer than poplars, more lush, but most of the buildings on both sides have also been repaired. From the entrance of "Stalin" Avenue, the tidy, beautiful, and magnificent new buildings stretch as far as the eye can see. Various state-owned shops are scattered here, and it has become the new home for thousands of working people. The citizens of Berlin are proud of it, and the Chinese delegation's praise for it is completely justified.
    I and several comrades from the delegation were settled in a villa in the suburbs. Upon arrival, we saw the itinerary arranged by the comrades of the German Democratic Republic for the Chinese delegation. From the afternoon of July 23rd to the evening of the 25th, Premier Zhou and other delegation comrades visited Premier Grotewohl and Acting President Dieckmann (President Pieck and Comrade Ulbricht were both in Moscow on official business), laid wreaths at the "Socialist Martyrs' Cemetery" (where the remains of German socialist pioneers from Liebknecht, Luxemburg, and Thälmann onwards are buried) and the Soviet Army Martyrs' Cemetery, attended the receptions held by Premier Grotewohl and Ambassador Ji Pengfei, visited factories and the Children's Palace, toured the city, participated in the Berlin citizens' rally, and received an honorary doctorate of law from Humboldt University... In such frequent activities, because every detail was arranged so meticulously and thoughtfully (for example, which leader would accompany us, who would be the guide, when to arrive, when to leave, etc.), every item could be implemented as scheduled. For the visitors, everything was as they wished, and they felt no sense of being guests in a foreign land. Thus, when the delegation left, the feelings of reluctance were truly overflowing.
    This is the friendship between our two countries. Our friendship and common will in international affairs were even more vividly expressed at the mass rally on the afternoon of July 24th. The Berlin citizens' representatives' rally to welcome Premier Zhou and the Chinese delegation, held at the "Werner Seelenbinder" sports hall, was attended by 5,000 people. Premier Zhou and Premier Grotewohl, in their speeches, pointed out the great significance of the achievements of the Geneva Conference. They said that in Geneva, peace had once again triumphed over war. The two premiers unanimously declared to the conference that the peaceful reunification of Germany should mainly be resolved by the German people themselves; in this just struggle, they have the support of the world's peace forces led by the Soviet Union.
    I felt that the excitement of the masses present at that time was indescribable. They shouted "Friendship," "Friendship," endlessly. The artificial division of a nation and the reduction of West Germany to a colony of American imperialism is something that no patriotic German can tolerate. I heard that the reactionary press in West Berlin mostly implemented a "blockade" policy on the content of this conference. However, the residents of West Berlin were spreading the speeches of the two premiers everywhere. Like the people living in the German Democratic Republic, the people living in West Germany resolutely opposed the evil actions of American imperialism in arming West Germany and obstructing the peaceful reunification of the German nation. That is why they regarded the achievements of the Geneva Conference as their own achievements, and every victory of the world's peace and democratic forces as their own victory.
  Four. The Humboldt University Ceremony
    Early in the morning of July 25th, Premier Grotewohl came to Premier Zhou's residence, and the two jointly drafted a communiqué expressing the common will of the two peoples. Then, Premier Zhou, accompanied by Premier Grotewohl, went to Humboldt University (formerly Berlin University) on Unter den Linden to receive an honorary doctorate of law conferred by the university. This was at eleven o'clock in the morning.
    From ten o'clock onwards, the entrance of Humboldt University, both sides of the corridor leading to the second gate, and even the inner hall were crowded with representatives from the 10,000 students of each college. Premier Zhou was received by President Dr. Ney into the living room upstairs, where he met with the deans of all ten colleges of the university. The deans, dressed in gold-embroidered robes and hats of red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, and gray, were dignified and very serious. It is said that these are costumes handed down from the seventeenth century and used in the most solemn ceremonies.
    Guided by four people wearing long robes and holding golden scepters, Premier Zhou, the president, and the deans of each college entered the auditorium. Sitting in the guest seats were Premier Grotewohl and the ministers of various ministries, the president and vice president of the Academy of Sciences, and famous figures from all walks of life across the country. Behind them were all the Chinese students studying in the German Democratic Republic and representatives of the departments and faculties of Humboldt University. Phan Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, also participated in the ceremony on his way home, passing through Berlin.
    President Ney, wearing a red robe, first delivered a speech, warmly welcoming Premier Zhou. Dean Staniger of the Faculty of Law gave a long speech describing the world significance of the Chinese people gaining independence and liberation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and praised Premier Zhou's contribution to this great struggle for national independence and rights. This is also the reason why Humboldt University awarded him an honorary doctorate of law.
    Then, amidst applause and congratulations from the audience, Premier Zhou accepted the honorary doctorate of law certificate, contained in a long red circular box and signed by the president and the dean of the Faculty of Law, as well as a large red book, like a commemorative album, containing photos of the Humboldt brothers (one was a legal scholar, one was a philosopher and historian) teaching there 150 years ago. Especially precious were the photos of the relics and works of Karl Marx, the founder of scientific socialism and the mentor of the international workers' movement, from when he studied at the university from 1836 to 1841. It is said that Engels also attended lectures at the university in those years.
    After this, Premier Zhou delivered a speech. He thanked Humboldt University for the honor it had given him, believing that this honor was mainly given to the Chinese people and was another manifestation of the deep friendship between the Chinese and German peoples. Two female Youth League members ran to the podium to present flowers to Premier Zhou and enthusiastically kissed him, and the students in the audience applauded endlessly. Finally, in order to respond to the students' applause and congratulations, Premier Zhou stood up and raised his hand to greet them, and shouted "Long live our school - Humboldt University!" The emotions of the young people, the old people, the presidium, and the guests in the auditorium were completely integrated, and the atmosphere of the college became both serious and lively....
    At about one o'clock in the afternoon, Premier Zhou and other comrades of the delegation left Humboldt University to visit the exhibits in the "Karl Marx" Pavilion at the History Museum. Because I had matters to attend to, I was unable to go, and only from the slogans on the granite walls of the main hall of Humboldt University, I reviewed Marx's immortal saying: "Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it."
    On the morning of the 26th, in the drizzling rain, Premier Zhou and the comrades of the delegation shook hands with Premier Grotewohl and others at the airport, and flew to the second stop on our return journey - Warsaw.

    日内瓦归来
  　本报记者　吴文焘
    三、柏林三日
    当我和代表团的一部分同志离开飞机场驶向城区时，沿途旗帜招展；虽然周总理的车子早已过去了，夹道欢迎的群众还没有完全散去，还对我们热情地招手。我注意到：在我们的车辆的最前列，是一辆带路的车子。它的前窗左侧有一盏蓝色的灯；用不着鸣号，更用不着交通警的呐喊，按照这辆蓝灯车的标志，在街道交叉或转湾的地方，一切车辆都自动停下来，让我们的车辆不需任何停留即行通过。民主德国一般人民的自觉的组织性和工作效率，是处处能够令人体会得到的。
    从日内瓦到东柏林，一个使我立刻感觉到的不同，就是那里街头巷尾有着熙熙攘攘的游客，而这里则多是卷着袖子、重建祖国首都的劳动者。记得一九五○年春天我第一次到柏林时，市中心的菩提树下街还是满目创痍；那条改以“斯大林”命名的大街，到处还是颓垣残壁；而今，不仅那几排类似白杨、枝叶却较白杨长些的菩提树儿更加茂盛了，两边的建筑也大都修葺起来。从“斯大林”大街的进口处，一眼望不到头的，是整齐美观、气派雄伟的崭新建筑。这里分散着国营的各种商店，这里成了千百劳动人民的新居。柏林的市民们以它而自豪，中国代表团的同志们的对它赞赏不已，是完全有理由的。
    我和代表团的几位同志一同被安顿在郊区的一所别墅里。一到那里，就看到德意志民主共和国的同志们为中国代表团所安排的访问日程表。计从七月二十三日下午到二十五日晚间，周总理和其他代表同志们拜会格罗提渥总理和代理总统狄克曼（皮克总统和乌布利希同志都因公到莫斯科去了）、到“社会主义烈士公墓”（那里是从李卜克内西、卢森堡、台尔曼以后的德国社会主义者先烈们安息的地方）和苏军烈士墓献花圈，出席格罗提渥总理和姬鹏飞大使举行的招待会，访问工厂和少年儿童宫、参观市容、参加柏林市民大会、到胡包特大学接受名誉法学博士学位……。在这样频繁的活动里，由于每一个细节都被安排得十分妥贴周到（例如由那位首长陪同，谁来作向导、何时到达、何时离去等），从而使每一项目都能按部就班地如期实现，而对访问者们来说，则是处处随心所欲，虽在他乡而无作客之感。这样，到代表团离开的时候，彼此依依之情，确是溢于言表的。
    这就是我们两国间的友谊。我们之间的友谊和在国际事务上的共同意志，更生动地表现在七月二十四日下午的群众大会上。在“魏纳·西兰宾德”体育馆举行的柏林各界市民代表欢迎周总理和中国代表团的大会，有五千人参加。周总理和格罗提渥总理先后在他们的讲话中指出日内瓦会议成就的伟大意义，他们说：在日内瓦，和平又一次战胜了战争。两位总理一致向大会宣称：德意志的和平统一，主要应由德意志人民自己来解决；在这一正义的斗争中，他们有着以苏联为首的世界和平势力的支持。
    我觉得：这时到会群众的兴奋，是难以形容的。他们高呼“友谊”、“友谊”，历久不息。一个民族被人为地分裂开来，并使西部德国沦为美帝国主义的殖民地，这是每一个有爱国心的德国人所不能容忍的。我听说西柏林的反动报刊大都对于这次大会的内容实行“封锁”政策。可是西柏林的居民，却到处交头接耳地传布两位总理的演说。居住在西德的人民和德意志民主共和国的人民一样，坚决反对美帝国主义的武装西德、阻挠德意志民族和平统一的罪恶行径。这就是为什么他们把日内瓦会议的成就当成他们自己的成就，把世界和平民主力量的每一个胜利当成他们自己的胜利。
  四、胡包特大学的典礼
    七月二十五日清早，格罗提渥总理来到周总理的寓所，二人共同商拟了表示两国人民共同意志的公报；接着，周总理就由格罗提渥总理陪同前往菩提树下街的胡包特大学（即柏林大学）接受该校授予的名誉法学博士学位。这是上午十一点钟的时候。
    从十点钟起，胡包特大学的门口、通往二门的甬道两边、以至内厅，就挤满了各院一万同学的代表们。周总理由校长奈伊博士接入楼上的客厅，在那里和全校十个学院的院长们见面。院长们按照院别穿着红、橙、黄、绿、青、蓝、紫、灰等颜色的绣金长袍和帽子，道貌岸然，十分严肃。据说，这是从十七世纪传下来，用在最隆重的典礼上的服式。
    在四个着长袍、持金色节杖的人员引导下，周总理和校长及各院院长进入礼堂。来宾席上坐着格罗提渥总理和各部部长们，科学院的院长和副院长、以及全国各界有名人物。后面，就是在德意志民主共和国学习的全体中国学生和胡包特大学各院系同学的代表。越南民主共和国范文同副总理在返国途中路过柏林，也参与了这个典礼。
    穿着大红袍的奈伊校长首先致词，热烈欢迎周总理。法学院院长史坦尼格在一个长篇演说里讲述中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下获得独立解放的世界意义，并赞扬了周总理在这一争取民族独立和权利的伟大斗争中的贡献。这也就是胡包特大学授给他名誉法学博士学位的原因。
    接着，在全场鼓掌道贺声中，周总理接过了那张用红色长圆盒装着的、由校长和法学院长共同签字的名誉法学博士学位证书，还有一大本红色的、像是纪念册的书，内有一百五十年前胡包特兄弟（一位是法律学家，一位是哲学和历史学家）执教时的照片。特别珍贵的是里面还有科学社会主义的创始者、国际工人运动的导师马克思从一八三六年到一八四一年在该校读书时的遗物和遗作的照片。据说，恩格斯当年也曾在该校听过课。
    这以后，就是周总理讲话。他感谢胡包特大学所给予他的荣誉，认为这个荣誉主要是给予中国人民的，也是中德两国人民间深厚友谊的又一表现。……两个女青年团员跑到讲台上向周总理献花，并热情地吻了他，台下同学们鼓掌不已。最后，为了回答同学们的鼓掌道贺，周总理站起来向他们举手致意，并高呼“我们的学校——胡包特大学万岁！”礼堂里的青年人、老年人，主席团和来宾间的情感完全融汇在一起了，学院的空气，变得既严肃又活泼……。
    下午一时许，周总理和代表团其他同志们离开胡包特大学，要去历史博物馆瞻仰“卡尔·马克思”馆的陈列品，我因有事不克前往，只从胡包特大学正厅花岗石壁的标语中，温习了马克思那句不朽的名言：“哲学家们曾经只是用不同的方式说明世界，但是现在问题是在于改变世界。”
    二十六日清晨，在细雨濛濛中，周总理和代表团的同志们在飞机场和格罗提渥总理等握别，飞向我们归途中的第二站——华沙。
