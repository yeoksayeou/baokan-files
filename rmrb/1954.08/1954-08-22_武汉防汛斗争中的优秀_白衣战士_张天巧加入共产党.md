    Outstanding "White-Clad Warrior" in Wuhan's Flood Control Struggle
    Zhang Tianqiao Joins the Communist Party
    Zhang Tianqiao, a "White-Clad Warrior" on the embankment along the Yangtze River in Wuhan, is one of the first eight outstanding flood control fighters to be accepted into the Chinese Communist Party on the embankment.

    On the 11th, the reporter met her at the command post of a certain embankment section and went patrolling the embankment with her. Carrying a medicine bag and wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat, she asked everyone on the embankment if they were cold or hot, and people greeted her warmly. The Red Cross flag on her shoulder fluttered in the river wind.

    "The health of hundreds of people on this section of the embankment is entrusted to my medical team," she told the reporter. "People are selflessly reinforcing the embankment and fighting the flood in the wind and rain, which really moves me. I can't carry soil to build the embankment, but I am determined to ensure the health of the flood control personnel."

    Every night, the river wind sweeps across the embankment, and there is still a chill. Zhang Tianqiao and the medical team members Liu Guangqian, Sun Jianshuang, and Fan Feihuang, after patrolling the embankment during the day, quietly enter the dormitories of the embankment workers and cover them with quilts one by one. On rainy days, Zhang Tianqiao suggested boiling ginger and brown sugar water for the divers and workers who got wet in the rain to prevent them from catching a cold.

    Zhang Tianqiao and the medical team she leads work more than ten hours a day. During the day, she has to give medicine and change dressings to the workers who come down from the embankment on shifts at the medical station; whether it is on rainy days with knee-deep water or on exceptionally hot sunny days, she has to patrol the embankment for medical treatment; she also has to squeeze out time to teach the workers the necessary hygiene knowledge during flood control, and together with her medical team members, give the workers vaccinations, and spray disinfectant in the workers' dormitories, kitchens, and toilets.

    Today, there are more than 1,200 medical workers like Zhang Tianqiao in Wuhan, who are protecting the health of more than 100,000 flood control troops and the people in the flooded areas of the suburbs on the front line of flood control with the spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism.

### 武汉防汛斗争中的优秀“白衣战士”  张天巧加入共产党

    武汉防汛斗争中的优秀“白衣战士”
    张天巧加入共产党
    武汉沿江大堤上的“白衣战士”张天巧，是在堤防上第一批被接收加入中国共产党的八个优秀防汛战士中的一个。
    十一日，记者在某堤段指挥所遇见她，和她一同到堤上巡逻。她背着药包，戴着宽沿草帽，一路向堤上的人们问冷问热，人们也都亲热地向她打招呼。扛在她肩上的红十字救护旗迎着江风呼拉拉地响。
    “这一段堤上几百人的健康都交给我的医疗组了。”她对记者说：“人们在大风大雨里忘我地培堤抢险，真叫我感动。我不会担土筑堤，但我要决心保证防汛人员们的健康。”
    每天深夜，江风掠过堤防，还有一阵凉意。张天巧和医疗组的刘光前、孙剑霜、范飞黄继白天巡堤之后，又悄悄地走进堤防工人的宿舍，给工人们一个个盖上棉被。在暴雨的日子里，张天巧建议烧姜糖水给潜水工人和淋雨的工人们喝，以免他们感冒。
    张天巧和她所领导的医疗组，天天要做十几个小时的工作。白天，她要在医疗站给堤上换班下来的工人擦药换药；不论在渍水没膝的雨天或是炎热异常的晴天，她要到堤上巡回医疗；她还要挤出时间把防汛期间必需的卫生知识教授给工人们，和医疗组的同伴们一起给工人注射防疫针，在工人们的宿舍、厨房和厕所里喷射消毒药剂。
    今天，武汉市有一千二百多名像张天巧这样的医务工作者，正以革命的人道主义精神在防汛前线，保卫着十多万防汛大军和市郊积水区人民的健康。（新华社）
