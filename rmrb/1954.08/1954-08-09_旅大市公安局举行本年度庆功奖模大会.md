    Lüda Municipal Public Security Bureau Holds This Year's Celebration and Award Ceremony for Model Workers
    The Lüda Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau held its 1954 celebration and award ceremony for model workers on July 24th. At the meeting, two public security stations were awarded collective major merit, eighteen units were awarded collective merit, and six hundred and twenty-two models and meritorious individuals were rewarded. These model units and model individuals have made significant achievements in safeguarding economic construction and people's lives. For example, Zhao Yuzhang, deputy director of the Houjiagou Police Station, who has been rated as a model twice, awarded two major merits and two collective merits, and was again rated as a model this time, is able to listen to the opinions of the masses and care about their hardships. He has a very good relationship with the residents and is able to actively educate residents to abide by the law. Residents are willing to consult him when they have problems, so that the police station has successfully solved cases that endanger national economic construction and social order several times with the help of residents. Wang Fengchang, a traffic police officer who has been awarded two merits and was rated as a model this time, actively responded to the call of his superiors and made achievements in maintaining the safety of pedestrians and vehicles. Yang Renli, a security section member of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company, who died heroically, was posthumously recognized as a model this time. When he was in charge of security work, he consistently actively studied his profession and tried to find ways to complete his tasks. On the night of March 3rd this year, while patrolling on a ship, he discovered a pile of fire on the deck. The fire was fierce, and if it was not extinguished immediately, there was a danger of a major disaster. At this time, Yang Renli bravely picked up the burning wood and threw it into the sea, unfortunately falling into the sea and sacrificing himself.
    The model figures that emerged from the Lüda Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau this time were selected on the basis of daily evaluation and assessment work. The evaluation and assessment work has transformed the sudden meritorious service and model creation movement into a regular work. This transformation began in 1952. The entire public security bureau system summarizes the assessment work once a year and holds a conference to reward the model units and individuals who have emerged in the annual assessment. Rewards are given at any time when significant events occur. In addition, the system of reporting work to the masses has been promoted in various public security stations, and work is reported to the masses and their opinions are listened to regularly, which helps the assessment work. After the implementation of the evaluation and assessment, the enthusiasm of public security personnel for work has been greatly encouraged, work efficiency has been significantly improved, and discipline has also been strengthened.

    旅大市公安局举行本年度庆功奖模大会
    旅大市人民政府公安局七月二十四日举行了一九五四年度的庆功奖模大会。会上奖励了立集体大功的两个公安派出所，立集体功的十八个单位和六百二十二个模范和功臣。这些模范单位和模范人物，在保卫经济建设和人民生活中，都有显著成绩。如曾被两次评为模范、立过两次大功和两次集体功，这次又被评为模范的侯家沟派出所副所长赵玉璋，能够倾听群众意见，关心群众疾苦。他和居民的关系很好，能够积极教育居民守法。居民有事都愿找他商量，因而使派出所有好几次在居民的协助下，顺利地破获了危害国家经济建设和社会秩序的案件。曾先后立过两次功、这次被评为模范的交通民警王凤昌，积极响应上级号召，在维护行人和车辆的安全方面作出了成绩。光荣殉职的中苏造船公司保卫科科员杨仁立，在这次被追认为模范。他在担任保卫工作的时候，一贯积极钻研业务，想办法完成任务。今年三月三日的夜里，他在轮船上巡逻时，发现甲板上有一堆火，火势很猛，如不立即扑灭有酿成巨灾的危险。这时杨仁立奋不顾身地拿起燃着的木头往海里扔，不幸失足落海牺牲。
    旅大市人民政府公安局这次涌现的模范人物是在平日评奖考绩工作的基础上选出的。评奖考绩工作是把带有突击性的立功、创模运动变为经常性的工作。这个转变是在一九五二年开始的，在整个公安局系统每年对考绩工作作一次总结，并召开大会奖励在一年考绩中涌现出的模范单位和人物。遇到意义重大的事件就随时奖励。另外在各个公安派出所推行了向群众报告工作的制度，定期向群众报告工作和听取群众意见，这个作法帮助了考绩工作的进行。评奖考绩推行以后，大大鼓舞了公安人员工作的积极性，工作效率得到显著提高，纪律性也加强了。　（新华社）
