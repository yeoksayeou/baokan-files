Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: The first session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress successfully concluded on the 23rd after seven days of meetings.

This meeting, building on the achievements of the past five years in constructing the capital, further promoted democracy, resulting in significant accomplishments. The meeting gloriously fulfilled the mission entrusted by the people of the city and elected representatives to the National People's Congress.

The meeting dedicated three days to conducting plenary discussions on the work of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, with sixty-one representatives fully expressing their opinions. The representatives seriously and sincerely criticized certain shortcomings in the government's various endeavors. Many representatives working in the government humbly accepted the criticisms, engaged in self-criticism, and expressed their determination to strengthen planning in their work, improve work quality, and enhance the political and ideological level and professional skills of cadres. Under the supervision of the people, they pledged to continuously overcome shortcomings and continue to advance with socialist work standards. The meeting believes that in future work, this style of criticism and self-criticism should continue to be promoted. As long as the People's Congress can fully play its role as the organ of state power, actively supervise the work of the government, and regularly point out errors and shortcomings in the government's work, the work of the People's Government will certainly be done better, and all endeavors will continuously develop and improve.

The meeting also carefully processed the representatives' proposals. Among them, fifty cases are planned to be submitted to the Municipal People's Government for handling; forty-one cases are planned to be submitted to the Municipal People's Government for reference. One case, regarding the resolute liberation of Taiwan, is proposed for discussion by the Congress. Other proposals have also been carefully processed. The meeting adopted the report of the Proposal Examination Committee on the examination of the proposals.

The meeting adopted a resolution on the government work report. The resolution stated that the Congress approves the government work report and calls on all the people of the capital to unite closely and strive to realize the various tasks put forward in the report.

The meeting also passed resolutions on "Supporting Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's Diplomatic Report, the Central People's Government's Call for Liberating Taiwan, and the Joint Declaration of Various Democratic Parties and People's Organizations for Liberating Taiwan" and "On Supporting and Further Propagating and Discussing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China."

After the meeting adopted various resolutions, Peng Zhen, Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, delivered a speech at the meeting.

The meeting was declared closed at 8:25 PM on the 23rd.

Xinhua News Agency: The first session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress closed on the 23rd. At the meeting, all the representatives unanimously adopted the "Resolution on Supporting Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's Diplomatic Report, the Central People's Government's Call for Liberating Taiwan, and the Joint Declaration of Various Democratic Parties and People's Organizations for Liberating Taiwan." The text is as follows:

The entire body of representatives of the First Session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress unanimously supports Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report delivered at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, the Central People's Government's call to liberate Taiwan, and the joint declaration of various democratic parties and people's organizations to liberate Taiwan.

Our country's consistent adherence to a peaceful foreign policy is the unanimous wish of our people. Due to our country and the Soviet Union's adherence to a peaceful foreign policy, the easing of international tensions has been promoted, thereby providing favorable conditions for our country's socialist construction. Our country must strive to jointly ensure the thorough implementation of the Geneva Conference's various agreements on restoring peace in Indochina with relevant countries, continue to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and continue to work to consolidate and develop our country's peaceful cooperative relations with all countries in the world, and to establish collective peace in Asia and the world.

Taiwan is an inseparable part of our country's territory, and it will never be allowed for the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique to occupy it, nor will it be allowed for the American aggressor clique to seize it as a military base for attacking our country, threatening our country's security, and threatening peace in the Far East and the world. We must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique. Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique is an exercise of China's sovereignty and is China's internal affair, which brooks no foreign interference. We must, together with our compatriots across the country, strengthen our work in all aspects, unite closely, heighten our vigilance, work hard in production, practice strict economy, work hard, study hard, complete the national construction plan, strengthen our national defense forces, actively support the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, and finally complete the sacred cause of liberation of the Chinese people.

    台湾是我国领土不可分割的一部分，决不容许蒋介石卖国集团盘踞，决不容许美国侵略集团侵占作为进攻我国的军事基地，威胁我国的安全，威胁远东和世界和平。我们一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，是行使中国的主权，是中国的内政，决不容许任何外国干涉。我们一定要同全国同胞一道，加强各方面的工作，紧密团结，提高警惕，努力生产，厉行节约，努力工作，努力学习，完成国家建设计划，加强国防力量，积极支援中国人民解放军，为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团，最后完成中国人民的神圣解放事业而奋斗到底。
