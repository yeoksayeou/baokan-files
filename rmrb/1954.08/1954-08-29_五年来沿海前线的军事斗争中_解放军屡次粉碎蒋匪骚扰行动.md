Xinhua News Agency, August 27th -- The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, with the assistance and direction of the American aggressors, has been rampantly waging harassing and destructive warfare against the motherland. However, in recent years, all actions of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to intrude into the mainland and coastal islands have suffered defeat under the resolute blows of our People's Liberation Army.

　　In 1949, when the mainland of China was liberated, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique fled to Taiwan and engaged in a desperate struggle with the support of the American aggressors. At that time, the United States sent military advisors to Taiwan under the guise of "technical experts," secretly supplied the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique with a large amount of military equipment under the guise of "commercial companies," and stepped up the deployment of espionage activities against the mainland together with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique then used American-made aircraft to frantically bomb mainland coastal cities. On February 6, 1950, the Chiang bandits' air force carried out a bloody bombing of Shanghai, killing and wounding more than 1,000 residents and destroying a large number of houses and property. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique also carried out pirate-like destruction of the mainland coast, attempting to economically strangle the newborn People's Republic of China.

　　At that time, the Chinese People's Liberation Army annihilated all the Kuomintang reactionary troops on the mainland and continued to wipe out the remaining enemies on the coastal islands. From January to June 1950, the People's Liberation Army launched a series of courageous cross-sea attacks on the remaining Chiang bandit troops entrenched on the coastal islands of Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, and successively liberated Hainan Island, Dongshan Island, the Zhoushan Islands, and many other islands, annihilating more than 266,000 enemy troops. The victorious battles of the People's Liberation Army at that time dealt a severe blow to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique entrenched in Taiwan.

　　When the U.S. government launched the war of aggression against Korea in June 1950, it brazenly announced the occupation of our Taiwan by armed forces. The purpose of the American aggressive bloc was to save the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique that was about to be destroyed, and to directly control Taiwan Island in the hands of the United States as a military base for further aggression against our country and Asia. After the U.S. Seventh Fleet and the Thirteenth Air Force simultaneously occupied Taiwan, then Far East U.S. Commander-in-Chief MacArthur went to Taiwan to discuss with Chiang Kai-shek specific steps to fight against the Chinese people with Taiwan as a base. Subsequently, the United States openly announced that it would give the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique more military aid, and openly dispatched a military aid advisory group to Taiwan to equip and train Chiang Kai-shek's remaining troops.

　　With the further support of the American aggressive bloc, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek once clamored arrogantly that he would surely realize his so-called "one year of preparation, two years of counterattack, three years of mopping up, and five years of success" restoration plan, and stepped up harassment and piracy activities against the mainland and the coast. In recent years, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has detained and looted as many as 70 merchant ships from our country and various countries trading with our country, robbed more than 470 fishing boats, and kidnapped and killed more than 1,300 of our fishermen and crew members. In recent years, Chiang Kai-shek's remnant troops have continuously harassed the mainland and coastal islands. At the beginning, the number of people who rushed in each time was about dozens to hundreds, and later the number of people who rushed in gradually increased, with the largest number increasing to more than 10,000. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique attempted to occupy certain coastal islands as strongholds for large-scale incursions into the mainland.

　　In recent years, the land, sea, and air forces of our People's Liberation Army stationed in the coastal areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other provinces, and the local people, have launched fierce military struggles on the coastal defense front of thousands of kilometers, smashing the various large and small attacks and harassment of Chiang Kai-shek's remnant troops, protecting the coastal fishery production and the navigation of merchant ships, and capturing and annihilating a large number of special agents who parachuted and sneaked into the mainland. The battle of Dongshan Island in July 1953 was one of the victorious battles of our People's Liberation Army against the intrusion of remnant Chiang bandit troops on the islands. At that time, under the planning of American military advisers, the Chiang bandits attacked Dongshan Island with more than 10,000 people, but as a result, they were defeated and fled in embarrassment, and more than 3,300 people were annihilated by us. From July 1950 to July 1953, the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces annihilated more than 80,000 remnant Chiang bandit troops, liberated the Shengsi Islands, Dongtou and other important islands and many other islands, forcing Chiang Kai-shek's remnant troops to shrink to a few islands such as Kinmen, Matsu, and Dachen along the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang.

　　The increasingly strong navy and air force of our People's Liberation Army showed great power in several years of combat. According to the statistics of our navy from April 1950 to July 1954 alone, a total of 201 battles were fought in the southeastern coast, sinking, damaging and capturing 121 Chiang bandit ships and boats, shooting down and wounding 22 enemy planes, and covering the coastal transportation and the fishing production activities of the vast number of fishermen.

　　After the Korean armistice and the Geneva Conference reached the Indochina peace agreement, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, relying on the protection of the US Navy and Air Force and further military assistance from the US aggressive bloc, is reorganizing and expanding its army, clamoring to strengthen preparations for attacking the mainland, and stepping up harassment and destructive warfare against the mainland and the coast. The number of military aid advisory groups sent by the United States to Taiwan is expected to increase from 800 to 1,500. The United States plans to provide the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique with US$650 million in military and economic aid from July 1954 to June 1955 to supply the equipment and training of Chiang Kai-shek's remnant land, sea, and air forces. In order to strengthen the harassment and sabotage activities of the remnant Chiang bandit army against the mainland and the coast, the United States plans to transfer six destroyers (two of which have already sailed to Taiwan), several military boats and 80 F-86 Sabre jet fighters to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. According to Taiwan's United Daily News on July 31, the work of the US military aid advisory group stationed in Taiwan to train Chiang Kai-shek's army will change from defensive training to offensive training. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is also stepping up the dispatch of special agents to the mainland from Taiwan, Dachen, and Kinmen as strongholds to engage in assassination and sabotage activities. In order to achieve the goal of long-term occupation of Taiwan, the American aggressive bloc is planning to conclude a so-called "bilateral treaty of common security" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The U.S. "Navy has been ordered to patrol the entire coast of China" in an attempt to further prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan.

　　But the conspiracies of the American aggressive bloc and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique will inevitably continue to be defeated. The war situation in the coastal areas in the past five years shows that the powerful army and the growing navy and air force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the support of the people of the whole country, can not only firmly defend the security of the motherland, but also completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's remnant troops and complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan.

    五年来沿海前线的军事斗争中
    解放军屡次粉碎蒋匪骚扰行动
      【新华社二十七日讯】蒋介石卖国集团在美国侵略者的援助和指使下，猖獗地对祖国进行着骚扰性和破坏性的战争。但是几年来蒋介石卖国集团所有窜犯大陆和沿海岛屿的行动，都在我人民解放军的坚决打击下遭受了失败。
    一九四九年全国大陆解放，蒋介石卖国集团逃踞台湾，在美国侵略者的支持下进行绝望的挣扎。当时美国以“技术专家”的名义派遣军事顾问到台湾，以“商业公司”的名义秘密供给蒋介石卖国集团大批军事装备，并同蒋介石卖国集团加紧布置对大陆的特务活动。蒋介石卖国集团当时用美国制造的飞机，疯狂地轰炸大陆沿海城市。一九五零年二月六日，蒋贼空军对上海进行了血腥的轰炸，炸死炸伤居民一千多人，毁坏了大批房屋和财产。蒋介石卖国集团并对大陆海岸进行海盗式的破坏，企图从经济上来扼杀新生的中华人民共和国。
    当时，中国人民解放军在大陆上消灭了全部国民党反动军队，正继续扫荡沿海岛屿上的残余敌人。从一九五零年一月到六月，人民解放军连续向盘踞广东、福建、浙江沿海岛屿上的残余蒋匪军发起勇猛的渡海攻击，先后解放了海南岛、东山岛、舟山群岛等重要岛屿和许多其他岛屿，歼灭敌军二十六万六千多人。当时解放军的胜利战斗，使盘踞台湾的蒋介石卖国集团受到了严重的打击。
    美国政府在一九五零年六月发动侵略朝鲜战争时，悍然宣布以武装力量侵占我国台湾。美国侵略集团的目的，是为了挽救覆灭在即的蒋介石卖国集团，并使台湾岛直接控制在美国手中作为进一步侵略我国和亚洲的军事基地。当美国第七舰队和第十三航空队同时侵占台湾以后，前远东美军总司令麦克阿瑟即到台湾，同蒋介石商定以台湾为基地对中国人民作战的具体步骤。继而美国公开宣布给蒋介石卖国集团以更多的军事援助，并公开派遣军事援助顾问团到台湾，装备和训练蒋介石的残余军队。
    在美国侵略集团进一步的支持下，卖国贼蒋介石曾狂妄地叫嚣必可实现他所谓“一年准备，二年反攻，三年扫荡，五年成功”的复辟计划，并加紧对大陆和沿海进行骚扰和海盗活动。几年来，蒋介石卖国集团扣留和劫掠我国以及各国来我国通商的商船已达七十艘之多，劫夺我渔船已达四百七十多只，绑架和残害我渔民和船员已达一千三百多人。蒋介石残余军队在几年中不断地窜扰大陆和沿海岛屿。开始时每次窜扰的人数约几十名到几百名，后来窜扰的人数逐渐增加，最多的一次增加到一万多名。蒋介石卖国集团企图占领某些沿海岛屿，以作为大规模进犯大陆的据点。
    几年来，我人民解放军驻浙江、福建、广东等省沿海地区的陆、海、空军和当地人民，在长达数千公里的海防前线展开了激烈的军事斗争，粉碎了蒋介石残余军队的各次大小袭击和骚扰，保护了沿海的渔业生产和商船的航行，并捕获和消灭了空降和潜入大陆的大批特务。一九五三年七月东山岛的战斗，是我人民解放军打击残余蒋匪军窜犯海岛的胜利战斗之一。当时蒋贼在美国军事顾问的策划下，以万余之众袭击东山岛，但结果却狼狈溃退，被我歼灭了三千三百多人。从一九五零年七月到一九五三年七月，人民解放军陆、海、空军共消灭残余蒋匪军八万多人，解放了嵊泗列岛、洞头等重要岛屿及许多其他岛屿，迫使蒋介石残余军队龟缩到福建、浙江沿海的金门、马祖、大陈等少数岛屿上。
    我人民解放军日益壮大的海、空军在几年战斗中显示了强大的威力。仅据我海军一九五零年四月到一九五四年七月的统计，在东南沿海共作战二百零一次，击沉、击伤和俘获蒋贼舰、船一百二十一只，击落击伤敌机二十二架，掩护了沿海航运和广大渔民的渔业生产活动。
    朝鲜停战和日内瓦会议达成印度支那和平协议以后，蒋介石卖国集团依靠美国海空军的庇护和美国侵略集团进一步的军事援助，正在整编和扩充军队，叫嚣加强进攻大陆的准备，并加紧对大陆和沿海进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争。美国派在台湾的军事援助顾问团的人数，准备由八百名增加到一千五百名。美国拟在一九五四年七月到一九五五年六月给予蒋介石卖国集团军事援助和经济援助六亿五千万美元，用来供应蒋介石残余陆、海、空军的装备和训练。为了加强残余蒋匪军对大陆和沿海进行骚扰和破坏活动，美国拟拨交蒋介石卖国集团六艘驱逐舰（目前已有两艘驶到台湾）、若干军用艇及八十架F—八十六型佩刀式喷气机。据七月三十一日台湾联合日报透露：美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团训练蒋介石军队的工作将从防御训练改为进攻训练。蒋介石卖国集团并以台湾、大陈、金门为据点，正在加紧向大陆派遣特务人员从事暗害和破坏活动。美国侵略集团为了达到长期侵占台湾的目的，正策划与蒋介石卖国集团缔结所谓“共同安全双边条约”。美国“海军已奉令到整个中国沿海进行巡逻”，企图进一步阻止中国人民解放台湾。
    但是美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团的阴谋活动必然要继续遭到失败。近五年来沿海地区的战况表明：中国人民解放军强大的陆军和日益壮大的海军及空军，在全国人民的支援下，不仅能够坚强地保卫祖国的安全，并且必能彻底消灭蒋介石残余军队，完成解放台湾的光荣任务。
