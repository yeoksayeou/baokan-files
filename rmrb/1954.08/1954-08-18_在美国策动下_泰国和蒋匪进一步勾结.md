According to an Agence France-Presse report on the 13th, Nai Phao Sriyanond, the head of the Thai pro-American traitorous clique, the head of special agents, and the Director-General of the Thai Police, will arrive in Taiwan before the end of this month to hold a series of talks with the Chiang bandits. The Agence France-Presse report said that Nai Phao Sriyanond's trip was arranged by US Ambassador to Thailand Donovan during his recent visit to Taiwan. In addition, a Thai military delegation will also visit Taiwan in September.
