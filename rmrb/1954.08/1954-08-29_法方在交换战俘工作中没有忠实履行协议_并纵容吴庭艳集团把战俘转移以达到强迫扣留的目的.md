Xinhua News Agency, August 27th dispatch: According to Vietnam News Agency North Vietnam, August 26th dispatch: The prisoner of war exchange work carried out in the past few days shows that the French side has not faithfully implemented the terms of the agreement reached.
	In Viet Tri, North Vietnam, the French side handed over 1,200 civilians to the Vietnamese side. Among them, 102 were over 50 years old, 50 were under 18 years old, 157 were ill, and another 157 were injured due to the abuse of the French army. Among them, 49 people did not receive clothes, and 422 people only received one set of clothes. In addition, the French side did not issue mosquito nets to the prisoners of war. The Vietnamese side handed over 521 prisoners of war to the French side, including 184 Africans, 120 Europeans and foreign legion soldiers, and 217 people from other places. Among the prisoners of war handed over by the Vietnamese side, except for three sick people, the rest were healthy. Each prisoner of war received two sets of clothes, underwear, shoes, hats, belts, mosquito nets, towels, rice bowls, backpacks, etc.
	In order to obstruct the prisoner of war exchange work, the US imperialist stooge Ngo Dinh Diem clique issued a piece of paper with a name written on it to each prisoner of war in the Tonson prisoner of war camp in Haiphong on the night of the 22nd, and forced each prisoner of war to remember this name as his own name.
	In Quo Hoi, in Nghe An province, Central Vietnam, the French side handed over 101 prisoners of war to the Vietnamese side on the 23rd. According to the list of prisoners of war to be handed over by the French side, there should have been 97 captured soldiers. However, after checking, it was found that the actual number of soldiers handed over did not match the list.
Xinhua News Agency, August 28th dispatch: According to the information recently provided by Vietnamese soldiers and civilians handed over by the French Federal Forces, since the signing of the Indochina Armistice Agreement, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, with the connivance of the French authorities, has exhausted all means to continue detaining the detained Vietnamese People's Army soldiers and cadres. Many people were transferred from North Vietnam to the South, and many important cadres were exiled to Con Lon Island and Phu Quoc Island.
	Nguyen Van Phuc, a former Vietnamese political prisoner detained by the French side in Camp No. 2 of Phu Quoc Island, said: "On July 8, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique transferred 160 cadres and soldiers to Bien Hoa province in South Vietnam. Until now, we have not heard any news about them."
	In an order issued on August 12, Tran Vinh Dac, the pseudo-independent district chief of Phu Quoc Island, openly stated that the agreement reached at the Trung Gia meeting on the prisoner of war issue should be cancelled. The order said: "Only the independent district chief of Phu Quoc Island has the right to decide on the method of handling prisoners of war. ... No one shall obey any decisions of other authorities without the consent of the district chief. This order replaces and cancels all the terms previously agreed upon at the Trung Gia local military conference."
	An inspection of the list of prisoners of war to be handed over by the General Headquarters of the French Federal Forces also reveals that the list does not include many people detained by the French side. In the past few days, most of the prisoners of war handed over by the French Federal Forces were civilians they had looted in recent "mopping-up" operations. Among the 1,942 people handed over by the French side in Cham Son, Thanh Hoa province, northern Central Vietnam on August 18, 107 were children. On August 21, the French side handed over 1,000 prisoners of war in Cam Son, including 568 civilians. The French Federal Forces handed over very few soldiers, and almost no resistance cadres were released.
	While the work of exchanging prisoners of war is in progress, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique continues to transfer prisoners of war to other places in order to achieve the purpose of forcible detention. The General Headquarters of the French Federal Forces turns a deaf ear to all these acts. This has caused many difficulties in the prisoner of war exchange work. In order to facilitate the handover of prisoners of war and thoroughly implement the terms agreed upon by both parties in Phu Loi, the French Federal Forces must immediately stop all provocative and destructive acts of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. It should hand over the complete list of resistance cadres to the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army and hand them all over in accordance with the armistice agreement.

    法方在交换战俘工作中没有忠实履行协议
    并纵容吴庭艳集团把战俘转移以达到强迫扣留的目的
    【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十六日讯：过去几天中所进行的战俘交换工作，表明法国方面没有忠实履行所达成的协议的条款。
    在北越的越池，法方移交给越方一千二百名平民。其中年龄在五十岁以上的有一百零二人，十八岁以下的少年有五十人，害病的一百五十七人，另有因法军的虐待而受伤的一百五十七人。在他们当中有四十九人没有得到衣服，有四百二十二人只领到一套衣服。此外，法方也没有发给战俘蚊帐。越方移交给法方五百二十一名战俘，其中有一百八十四名非洲人，一百二十名欧洲人和外籍军团的士兵，以及二百一十七名其他地方的人。在越方所移交的战俘中，除了三名病员以外，其余的人都是健康的。每个战俘都得到了两套衣服和内裤、鞋子、帽子、皮带、蚊帐、毛巾、饭碗、背包等。
    为了阻碍战俘交换工作的进行，美帝国主义的走狗吴庭艳集团在二十二日夜里，发给海防的团舍战俘营里的每一个战俘一张上面写有一个名字的纸条，并且强迫每一个战俘记住这个名字，作为自己的名字。
    在中越义安省的果会，法方在二十三日把一百零一个战俘交给越方。根据法方要移交的战俘的名单，应该有九十七名被俘战士。但是经过查对，发现真正移交的战士的数目同名单不符合。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十六日讯：根据法兰西联邦部队新近移交的越南战士和平民所提供的消息，自从印度支那停战协定签订以来，吴庭艳集团在法方当局纵容之下，用尽一切办法继续扣留被拘的越南人民军战士和干部。很多人被从北越解到南方去，不少重要干部被放逐到昆仑岛和富国岛。
    以前被法国方面拘禁在富国岛第二号营内的越南政治犯阮文福说：“七月八日，吴庭艳集团把一百六十名干部和战士转移到南越边和省。到现在为止，我们没有听到关于他们的任何消息。”
    富国岛伪独立分区长官陈永得在八月十二日发布的一条命令中公然表示要取消中稼会议就战俘问题所达成的协议。这个命令说：“只有富国岛独立分区长官有权决定处理战俘的方法。……未经分区长官同意不得服从其他当局的任何决定。这一命令代替并取消先前在中稼当地军事会议上达成协议的一切条款。”
    对法兰西联邦部队总司令部将移交的战俘的名单加以检查，也可以发现名单中没有包括被法方拘禁的许多人。在过去几天中，法兰西联邦部队移交的战俘大半是他们在最近的“扫荡”战中掳去的平民。八月十八日在中越北部清化省岑山移交的一千九百四十二人中，有一百零七名是儿童。八月二十一日法方在岑山移交了一千名战俘，其中有五百六十八名是平民。法兰西联邦部队移交的军人很少，抗战干部被释的几乎一个也没有。
    当此交换战俘的工作正在进行的时候，吴庭艳集团竟继续把战俘转移到别的地方去，以达到强迫扣留的目的。而法兰西联邦部队总司令部对所有这些行为充耳不闻。这就使交换战俘的工作发生了许多困难。为了便于战俘的移交，彻底执行双方在富流同意了的条款，法兰西联邦部队必须立即制止吴庭艳集团的一切挑衅和破坏行为。它应该把抗战干部的完整的名单交给越南人民军总司令部并按照停战协定把他们全部移交。
