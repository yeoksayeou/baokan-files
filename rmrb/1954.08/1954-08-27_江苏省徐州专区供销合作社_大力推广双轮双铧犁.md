The supply and marketing cooperatives in Xuzhou Special District, Jiangsu Province, are actively promoting two-wheel, two-share plows. According to incomplete statistics, the entire special district supplied 192 two-wheel, two-share plows in the second quarter. Many supply and marketing cooperatives in Tongshan, Xiao County, Pi County, and the suburbs of Xuzhou City have adopted the method of holding on-site trial performances in the fields of state-owned farms, agricultural producers' cooperatives, or mutual aid teams, while organizing local farmers to visit, to tell farmers about the advantages of two-wheel, two-share plows and teach them how to use them. Cadres from the Second District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xuzhou City brought two-wheel, two-share plows to plow four mu of land in the Pan Liting mutual aid team. After teaching the team members how to use them, the mutual aid team bought one immediately. The Dong Caijia Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Tongshan County bought a two-wheel, two-share plow this year. The cooperative members all said: "Two-wheel, two-share plows are really good. They can plow ten mu of silty soil fields every day. If you are plowing sandy soil, you can plow twelve mu. They are more than twice as fast as the old plows, and the quality is also good!"

Based on the effect and experience of promoting two-wheel, two-share plows in Xuzhou Special District, the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Federation decided to vigorously promote two-wheel, two-share plows in dry crop areas throughout the province. At present, the Production Materials Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Federation has ordered 2,000 two-wheel, two-share plows from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, which will be supplied to the vast number of farmers in the second half of this year.

    江苏省徐州专区供销合作社
    大力推广双轮双铧犁
    江苏省徐州专区的供销合作社积极推广双轮双铧犁。根据不完全的统计，全专区在第二季度供应的双轮双铧犁有一百九十二部。铜山、萧县、邳县和徐州市郊区的许多供销合作社，采取在国营农场、农业生产合作社或互助组的地里举行实地试验表演，同时组织当地农民参观的办法，把双轮双铧犁的优点告诉农民，并教会他们使用的方法。徐州市第二区供销合作社的干部带着双轮双铧犁，到潘立廷互助组耕了四亩地，教会组员们使用的方法以后，这个互助组当时就买了一部。铜山县东蔡家农业生产合作社今年买了一部双轮双铧犁，社员们都说：“双轮双铧犁真好，每天能耕十亩淤土田；若是耕沙土地，可以犁十二亩。比旧犁要快一倍多到两倍，质量也好！”
    根据徐州专区推广双轮双铧犁的效果和经验，江苏省合作总社决定在全省旱作物地区大力推广双轮双铧犁。现在，江苏省合作总社生产资料经理部已经向北京农业机械厂订购双轮双铧犁二千部，准备在今年下半年供应给广大农民。
