    Shandong Farmers Strengthen Field Management to Strive for Autumn Harvest
    In most areas of Shandong Province, crops are growing well. Farmers are working hard to strengthen field management and strive for an autumn harvest. Sorghum in various places is generally five to six feet tall, and millet is two to three feet tall. Most of the sorghum and millet have begun to head and tassel. In the early-maturing areas of the south and west, the millet ears have fully emerged, and spring corn has begun to cob. Cotton in general areas is more than a foot tall, with seven or eight fruit branches. The best cotton is more than two feet tall, with more than ten fruit branches and seventeen or eighteen flower buds. Most have already flowered and produced one or two young bolls. Peanuts have generally flowered and are bearing fruit.
    During May and June this year, many areas of Shandong once experienced drought. Under the leadership of Party and government organs at all levels, the broad masses of farmers used all available water sources and tools to irrigate day and night, ensuring the normal growth of most autumn seedlings. After two rainfalls in early and mid-July throughout the province, farmers in various places became even more active in field management. Early-maturing crops such as sorghum, millet, and corn have mostly been weeded four times, and crops in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have been weeded five times. Cotton has generally been weeded four to five times, and in some places, it has been weeded six times. Late-autumn crops such as soybeans and corn have been weeded once, and in areas with faster progress, they have been weeded twice. Many areas have also carried out summer topdressing after the rain. According to incomplete statistics from eight counties in the Jiaozhou area, more than 66,000 mu were topdressed after the rain. In order to strive to complete the cotton production increase task, cotton fields have generally been trimmed once, and in some areas, they have been trimmed twice.
    This year, Shandong also experienced relatively serious insect pests, and various places have paid attention to leading farmers in prevention and control. Areas with more serious insect pests have listed pest control as the central task of current agricultural production and have carried out pest control work through various meetings and mobilizing farmers to visit and teach pest control techniques, achieving preliminary results.

    山东省农民加强田间管理争取秋季丰收
    山东省大部地区农作物生长良好，农民们正努力加强田间管理，争取秋季丰收。各地高粱一般已有五、六尺高，谷子有二、三尺高。高粱、谷子大部分已打苞、抽穗，南部和西部早熟地区谷穗已经出齐，春玉米已开始结棒。一般地区棉花有一尺多高，长出七、八个果枝，最好的棉花有二尺多高，十多个果枝，十七、八个花蕾，大部分已经开花，并结出一、二个幼铃。花生已普遍开花结果。
    今年五、六月间山东不少地区曾一度发生旱象，广大农民在各级党、政机关领导下，利用一切水源、水具，日夜灌溉，保证了大部秋苗正常生长。七月上、中旬全省两度降雨后，各地农民更积极进行田间管理工作。早熟农作物高粱、谷子、玉米等大部锄过四遍，农业生产合作社和互助组的庄稼锄过五遍。棉花一般也锄了四遍到五遍，有的锄过六遍。晚秋作物大豆、玉米等已锄完一遍，进度快的地区已锄完二遍。许多地区并在雨后开展了夏季追肥工作，据胶州专区八个县的不完全统计，雨后追肥六万六千多亩。为了争取完成棉花增产任务，一般棉田都已修过一遍，有的地区修过两遍。
    今年山东虫害也相当严重，各地都注意领导农民进行防治。虫害较严重地区已把治虫工作列为当前农业生产的中心任务，并通过各种会议和发动农民参观、传授治虫技术等办法开展治虫工作，现已取得初步成效。　（张荣安）
