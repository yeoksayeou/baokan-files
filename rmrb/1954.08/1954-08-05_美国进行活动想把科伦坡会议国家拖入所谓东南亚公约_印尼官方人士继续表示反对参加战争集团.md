Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 4th: Indonesian officials continue to express opposition to joining the so-called Southeast Asia "Defense" Pact organization, which is being planned by the United States.

Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, Djojosukarto, said on the 3rd that he does not approve of concluding the so-called Southeast Asia Pact, because it is not beneficial to world peace.

Chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, Rendunouw, told reporters that it should be remembered that Indonesia's and India's independent foreign policies clearly do not want such a military treaty.

Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Tambunan, also stated in a conversation on the 2nd that the Indonesian government will continue to pursue an independent policy and will not participate in any Southeast Asia "Defense" Pact organization.

These official statements were made to the press after the Ceylonese Ambassador to Indonesia, Gunasinghe, paid a morning visit on the 3rd to the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, and after Sastroamidjojo received British Ambassador Morland on the 2nd. According to Jakarta sources, these visits are related to the current U.S. efforts to establish a Southeast Asia Pact organization. Newspaper reports say that the United States is trying to pull the Colombo Conference countries into this war bloc.

Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: Manila News: The Chairman of the Philippine Senate Defense Committee, Recto, advocated that the Philippines should cancel its decision to participate in the meeting to discuss the establishment of a Southeast Asian group modeled after the Atlantic aggressive bloc.

Recto said that the refusal of the countries participating in the Colombo Conference to participate in this meeting "makes it necessary for the Philippines" to take the same action. He pointed out that among the Asian countries, only the Philippines and Thailand have expressed their willingness to participate in the Southeast Asia group, so that these two countries in the Southeast Asia group will inevitably be completely at the mercy of the decisions of non-Asian countries.

    美国进行活动想把科伦坡会议国家拖入所谓东南亚公约
    印尼官方人士继续表示反对参加战争集团
   【新华社雅加达四日电】印尼官方人士继续表示反对参加美国策划的所谓东南亚“防御”公约组织。
    印尼国民党主席约约苏卡托三日说，他不赞成缔结所谓东南亚公约，因为这样对世界和平没有好处。
    国会外交小组委员会主席伦度诺乌对报界说，应当记住，印尼和印度的独立的外交政策显然不愿意要这样的军事条约。
    国会副议长谭布兰在二日的谈话中也表示，印尼政府将继续奉行独立的政策，印尼不参加任何东南亚“防御”公约组织。
    这些官方人士的谈话，是在锡兰驻印尼公使古尼辛哈三日晨拜访临时代理外交部长的阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理以及沙斯特罗阿米佐约二日接见英国大使摩兰德之后对报界发表的。据雅加达人士看来，这些访晤和美国目前进行的建立东南亚公约组织的活动有关。据报纸消息说，美国企图把科伦坡会议国家拉进这个战争集团里面来。
   【新华社四日讯】马尼拉消息：菲律宾参议院国防委员会主席雷克托主张，菲律宾应该取消参加讨论成立以大西洋侵略集团为样本的东南亚集团的会议的决定。
    雷克托说，参加科伦坡会议的国家拒绝参加这一会议，“使得菲律宾有必要”采取同样的行动。他指出，在亚洲的国家中只有菲律宾和泰国表示愿意参加东南亚集团，这样，这两个国家在东南亚集团中就势必完全听命于非亚洲国家的决定。
