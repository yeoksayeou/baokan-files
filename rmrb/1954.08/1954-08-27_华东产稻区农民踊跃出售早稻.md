    Farmers in East China's Rice-Producing Areas Actively Sell Early Rice

    Most rice-producing areas in East China have reaped a bumper harvest of early rice this year. Farmers in various rice-producing areas are now actively selling their newly harvested early rice to the state.

    The early rice in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces matured earlier and was already on the market in July. After entering August, early rice in Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces also began to be marketed in large quantities one after another. The amount of early rice purchased by the grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in East China continues to increase. In early August, the amount of early rice purchased in the entire region was equivalent to 118.07 percent of the amount purchased in late July. On August 9th, Yuyao County in Zhejiang Province purchased more than 3.6 million jin of early rice in one day, exceeding the highest daily purchase volume in the local area by more than three times. Farmers in Shuanghe, Zhangjiadian, and other places in Liu'an County, Anhui Province, have recently been selling more than 30,000 jin of early rice to the state every day. This year, when selling early rice, farmers in various places generally pay attention to drying and cleaning it. Many farmers also specially select high-quality early rice to sell to the state.

    华东产稻区农民踊跃出售早稻
    华东区绝大部分产稻地区今年早稻获得丰收。各产稻区的农民现在正积极把新收的早稻卖给国家。
    福建、浙江两省早稻成熟较早，七月间就已经登场；进入八月以后，江苏、安徽等省的早稻也陆续大量上市。华东区粮食部门和供销合作社收购早稻的数量不断增加。八月上旬，全区收购的早稻相当于七月下旬收购量的百分之一百一十八点零七。浙江省余姚县在八月九日一天收购早稻三百六十多万斤，超过当地历年每日收购量的最高纪录三倍以上。安徽省六安县双河、张家店等地的农民最近每天都卖给国家三万斤以上的早稻。今年各地农民出售早稻时，一般都注意晒干扬净，许多农民还特别挑选质量好的早稻卖给国家。（程华）
