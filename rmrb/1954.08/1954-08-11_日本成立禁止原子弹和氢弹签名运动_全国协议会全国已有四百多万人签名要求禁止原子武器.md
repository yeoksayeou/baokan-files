Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The National Council for the signature campaign to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, initiated by people from all walks of life in Japan, was officially established in Tokyo on the 8th. Several hundred initiators of the council and representatives of mass organizations attended the founding conference.

The founding conference decided to further expand and unify the burgeoning movement in Japan to ban atomic weapons, transforming it into a nationwide national movement. It will also widely appeal to countries around the world, demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs and the like.

One of the initiators of the council, the renowned Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa, wrote a letter to the founding conference stating: In order to prevent atomic energy from being used as a destructive force, the demand to prohibit atomic weapons must first become a truly unanimous opinion of all mankind. The Japanese people, who have unfortunately suffered from the disasters of atomic and hydrogen bombs, have the right and obligation to arouse world opinion.

As of 1:00 PM on the 8th, the secretariat of the National Council had received 4,174,461 signatures demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs. This includes 890,000 signatures from Hiroshima and 590,000 signatures from Nagasaki.
