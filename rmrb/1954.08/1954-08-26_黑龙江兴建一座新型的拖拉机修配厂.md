	Heilongjiang Builds a New Type of Tractor Repair and Assembly Plant

	Heilongjiang Province's first new type of tractor repair and assembly plant began construction on July 30th in the ancient city.

	This tractor repair and assembly plant is designed according to Soviet large-scale repair plant design standards. The plant has fourteen workshops, equipped with automatic cranes, large precision lathes, planers, shapers, washing machines, and grinding machines, as well as some precision measuring instruments. Most of the work in each workshop is automated. After tractors arrive at the plant, they are first washed by automatic high-pressure washing machines, then disassembled and distributed to various workshops for repair and assembly. After repair and assembly, they are sent to the installation workshop, and finally subjected to horsepower testing and certified as qualified by technical appraisal before leaving the factory.

	With the development of agricultural cooperativization, the number of tractors in Heilongjiang Province's tractor stations this year has more than doubled compared to last year. In order to fully utilize the efficiency of the machines, the construction of the tractor repair and assembly plant will be accelerated, and it is expected to be put into production in November.

    黑龙江兴建一座新型的拖拉机修配厂
    黑龙江省第一座新型的拖拉机修配厂，已于七月三十日在古城动工兴建。
    这座拖拉机修配厂是根据苏联大型修配厂的设计标准进行设计的。厂内有十四个车间，设有自动吊车、大型精密的车床、眼床、刨床、洗床和砂轮机等，还有一些精密的测量仪器等。各车间的工作大部是自动化的。拖拉机到厂后，首先经自动高压洗刷机洗刷，然后拆卸，即分到各车间修理配制，修配后送到安装车间，最后进行马力试验，经技术鉴定合格后出厂。
    随着农业合作化的发展，今年黑龙江省各拖拉机站的拖拉机，比去年增加一倍多。为充分发挥机器的效能，拖拉机修配厂将加速施工，预计在十一月间即可投入生产。（温永海）
