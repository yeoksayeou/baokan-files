Mr. Premier, dear Chinese friends:

It is difficult for me to find the words to express the deep gratitude that all of us feel for your kind hospitality and welcome to our council.

Our World Federation of Democratic Youth Council meeting concluded successfully yesterday. The discussions at the conference fully reflected the rapid development of the youth movement and struggles in colonial countries and around the world; reflected the strengthening unity of youth around the world, full of confidence and determination, working with all the people to strive for a better future in peace and friendship. The resolutions of the conference undoubtedly added new strength to the struggle for this noble common cause.

We came to Beijing—the heart of your motherland—from all over the world, representing youth of various political views and religious beliefs; in these few days, the fraternal friendship between the people and youth of the world and the people and youth of the great People’s Republic of China has become more vivid and profound. We understand that all future achievements depend on this unbreakable friendship. The victory of the people and youth of all countries is the victory of all of us, and it plays an important role in our common struggle.

Please allow me to raise a glass to the health and happiness of the Chinese youth and the great Chinese people in the future, and to their new victories!

Long live the great peace-loving people and youth of the People's Republic of China!

    世界青联主席柏尼尼在宴会上的讲话总理先生、亲爱的中国朋友们：
    我是很难找到语言来表达我们大家对你们为我们理事会的盛情招待及欢迎的深深感谢。
    我们世界民主青年联盟理事会会议在昨天胜利结束。大会中的讨论，充分地反映了殖民地国家及全世界青年运动与斗争的急速发展；反映了全世界青年在增强着团结，满怀信心和决心，和全体人民一起，在和平与友谊中争取着美好的将来。大会的决议，毫无疑问为这个崇高的共同事业的斗争增加了新的力量。
    我们是从世界各地来到北京——你们祖国的心脏，代表着各种政治见解及宗教信仰的青年；在这几天中，使全世界人民及青年与伟大的中华人民共和国人民及青年间兄弟般的友谊更为生动，更为深切。我们懂得一切未来的成就取决于这个牢不可破的友谊。各国人民及青年的胜利，也就是我们大家的胜利，它对我们的共同斗争都起着重要作用。
    请允许我为了中国青年及伟大的中国人民健康、幸福的将来和新的胜利而举杯！
    伟大的热爱和平的中华人民共和国人民和青年万岁！
