The Hubei Provincial People's Government, in order to protect the health of flood control personnel and the masses in flood-stricken areas, has dispatched 38 medical prevention teams, consisting of 611 people, including doctors, nurses, medical college lecturers, teaching assistants, and students, to the Jingjiang Diversion Area, the Jingjiang Dike, and the Huangmei-Guangji Dike to carry out disease prevention and treatment work. After arriving at their work locations, the medical prevention teams conducted in-depth investigations of illnesses, actively promoted disease prevention methods to the masses, and took concrete measures to improve environmental hygiene. Medicines and medical supplies worth 1.8 billion yuan have also been transported to various places along with the medical prevention teams.

In order to provide free medical care to disaster victims, the Hubei Provincial People's Government has now allocated 3 billion yuan in medical expenses to the Jingzhou, Huanggang, and Xiaogan Special Zones. The Central People's Government has also allocated 3 billion yuan in medical expenses to the Hubei Provincial People's Government, as well as a large amount of bleaching powder, DDT, and anti-malarial drugs.

Due to the active concern of the People's Government for the health of the people in disaster areas, no epidemics have occurred in the flood-stricken areas of Hubei Province.

The Wuhan branch of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation has recently transported a large batch of medicines for treating diseases, first aid, disinfection, and insecticides, and has overcome difficulties in transportation to actively supply the needs for medicines in flood control and disaster relief.

The China National Pharmaceutical Corporation has instructed pharmaceutical supply stations in various places to vigorously supply medicines needed by Wuhan and other places for flood control and disaster relief. Regardless of whether there is a prior requisition plan, allocations must be made as much as possible. Shanghai, Guangzhou and other places have successively transferred large quantities of Ten Drops of Water, penicillin and other medicines and raw materials to Wuhan. Wuhan's pharmaceutical processing plants are also working day and night to rush production. In the first half of July alone, the Wuhan branch of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation supplied 670,000 bottles of Ten Drops of Water, 1,200 bottles of chloramphenicol capsules, 750,000 anti-inflammatory tablets, and a large number of other medicines and gauze.

    湖北省人民政府派医疗预防队到防汛地区
    武汉市防汛中需用的药品得到大量供应
    湖北省人民政府为了保护防汛人员和水灾地区群众的健康，先后派遣由医生、护士和医学院讲师、助教及学生共六百十一人组成的三十八个医疗预防队，到荆江分洪区、荆江大堤和黄（梅）广（济）大堤等地进行防治疾病的工作。各医疗预防队到达工作地点以后，都深入调查病情，积极向群众宣传预防疾病的方法，并采取具体措施，改进环境卫生。价值十八亿元的医药用品也已随同医疗预防队运到各地。
    为了对灾民实行免费医疗，湖北省人民政府现已拨给荆州、黄冈和孝感专区医药经费三十亿元。中央人民政府也拨交湖北省人民政府医药经费三十亿元及大量漂白粉、滴滴涕和防疟药品。
    由于人民政府积极关怀灾区人民健康，湖北省水灾地区没有发生疫病。

    中国医药公司武汉市分公司近来运到大批治病、急救、消毒、杀虫等药品，并克服运输中的困难，积极供应了防汛救灾中对药品的需要。
    中国医药公司曾经指示各地医药供应站大力供应武汉等地在防汛救灾中需要的药品，无论事先有无要货计划，都必须尽量予以调拨。上海、广州等地已先后调运大批十滴水、青霉素等药品和原料给武汉。武汉市各药品加工厂也日夜加工赶制。仅七月上半月，中国医药公司武汉市分公司就供应了十滴水六十七万瓶，氯霉素胶丸一千二百瓶，消炎片七十五万片，以及大批其他的药剂和纱布等物品。
