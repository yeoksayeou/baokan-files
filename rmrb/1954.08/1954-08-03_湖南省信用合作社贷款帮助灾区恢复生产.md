Credit cooperatives in Hunan Province are actively issuing loans to support farmers in flood-stricken areas to restore production. In June, over 9,000 credit cooperatives across the province issued a total of more than 49 billion yuan in loans, an increase of 46.4 percent compared to the amount of loans issued in May. The Yanzhou Township Credit Cooperative in Nan County issued 10.08 million yuan in loans in June, and the Wang Haiping Township Credit Cooperative in the Second District of Hanshou County issued 16 million yuan in loans, both of which played a significant role in helping local farmers drain waterlogged fields. The Luguang Credit Cooperative in the Eleventh District of Xinhua County loaned more than 5 million yuan to help local farmers replant over 50 mu of coarse grains. In addition to promptly issuing large amounts of agricultural loans, local People's Banks are also vigorously helping credit cooperatives solve funding problems. According to statistics from twelve counties in the Shaoyang region and Changde County alone, the People's Bank has loaned 6.4 billion yuan to credit cooperatives.

    湖南省信用合作社贷款帮助灾区恢复生产
    湖南省各地信用合作社积极发放贷款，支持遭受水灾地区的农民恢复生产。全省九千多个信用合作社在六月份共发放贷款四百九十多亿元，比五月份发放贷款数量增加了百分之四十六点四。南县滟洲乡信用合作社六月份放出贷款一千零八十万元，汉寿县第二区王海坪乡信用合作社发放贷款一千六百万元，都对帮助当地农民排除积水起了很大作用。新化县第十一区炉观信用合作社贷款五百多万元，帮助当地农民补种了五十多亩杂粮。各地人民银行除及时发放大批农贷外，同时还大力帮助信用合作社解决资金问题。仅据邵阳专区十二个县及常德等县的统计，人民银行贷给信用合作社的资金已达六十四亿元。
