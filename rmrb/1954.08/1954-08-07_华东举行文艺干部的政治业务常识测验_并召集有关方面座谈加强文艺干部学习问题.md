The East China Administrative Council's Cultural Bureau recently held a test on current affairs, politics, and literary and artistic knowledge for literary and art cadres in order to understand the situation of political and professional studies of literary and art cadres in East China. More than 600 people participated, including literary and art administrative cadres and professional creative cadres from more than 20 cultural and artistic work units at the East China level and in Shanghai. The test was divided into two parts: 1. Current affairs, politics, and social knowledge; 2. Literary and artistic knowledge. The results of the test showed that about three-quarters of the total number of people scored above 60 (passing), and about one-quarter scored below 60. The results of this test showed some progress compared with the knowledge test of three literary and art business units (screenwriters, directors, and actors) in East China two years ago. More than 160 people participated in that test, and only 16 passed. The average score of the test was only 39 points.

Although the percentage of passers has increased this time, the results are still not very good. Most of the test questions were relatively easy, but quite a few literary and art cadres, and even some relatively responsible cadres, could not answer or answered incompletely, and some even mistakenly answered "Guatemala" as a person's name; answered Urumqi as the president of a certain country; answered the author of "Midnight" as Gorky; and some people could not answer the names of the authors of "The Scholars" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."

It can be seen from the test results that many literary and art cadres still do not care about politics or study their profession, and some people do not even read newspapers. For example, more than 50 people answered incorrectly the question "Which three countries does Indochina include?"; and more than seven-tenths of the people answered incorrectly or incompletely the question "What is the Party's task in agriculture in the general line during the transition period?"

The East China Administrative Council's Cultural Bureau has conducted preliminary research based on the results of this test and convened a symposium of responsible persons from various agencies and organizations to exchange opinions on how to strengthen the study of literary and art cadres in the future.

The Liberation Daily reported the above situation on July 30 and published an editorial entitled "Strengthen the Political and Professional Study of Literary and Art Cadres," pointing out that although the study situation of literary and art cadres in East China has improved somewhat, many literary and art units still lack leadership in the study of cadres, lack a certain study system, and have not stipulated the necessary study time, or although they have, they often have no follow-through. Some writers and artists not only do not seek progress politically, but also have serious complacency in their professional work. Some even never participate in any collective study or self-study. It is worth noting and improving that some senior cadres do not care about politics and are lax in their studies. The editorial also responded to the call of the "People's Daily" and called on the literary and art circles to fully recognize the importance of improving political and artistic accomplishment for the development of the literary and art cause, and to further strengthen political and professional study.

    华东举行文艺干部的政治业务常识测验
    并召集有关方面座谈加强文艺干部学习问题
    华东行政委员会文化局为了了解华东文艺干部时事政治和业务学习的情况，最近举行了一次文艺干部的时事政治及文艺常识测验。参加者六百多人，包括华东一级及上海市文化艺术工作单位二十多个的文艺行政工作干部和专业创作干部。测验分两部分：一、时事政治和社会知识；二、文艺常识。测验结果，六十分以上（及格）者约占总人数四分之三，六十分以下者约四分之一。这次测验的成绩，比两年前华东三个文艺业务单位（编剧、导演、演员）的常识测验成绩，有了一些进步。那次参加测验的有一百六十多人，及格的只有十六人。测验的平均成绩只三十九分多。
    这次及格人数百分比虽然增高了，但成绩还不是很好。试题的绝大部分是比较容易的，可是相当多的文艺干部，以至一部分比较负责的干部，竟答不出或答得不完全，甚至有的错误到把“危地马拉”答作是人名；把乌鲁木齐答作是某个国家的总统；把“子夜”的作者答作是高尔基；有些人回答不出“儒林外史”和“三国演义”的作者姓名。
    从测验成绩中看出，有许多文艺干部依然不关心政治、不学习业务，甚至有些人连报纸也不看。例如“印度支那包括那三个国家？”就有五十多人回答错了；又如“党在过渡时期的总路线在农业方面的任务是什么？”竟有十分之七以上的人回答得不正确或不完全。
    华东行政委员会文化局已经根据这次测验的结果，进行了初步研究，并召开了一次各机关、团体负责人的座谈会，就今后怎样加强文艺干部的学习问题交换了意见。
    解放日报在七月三十日报道了以上情况，并发表题为“加强文艺干部的政治和业务学习”的社论，指出华东文艺干部的学习情况虽然有了一些改进，但还有不少文艺单位对干部的学习缺乏领导，没有一定的学习制度，没有规定必要的学习时间，或者虽然有了，却常常有头无尾。有些作家、艺术家在政治上既不求上进，在业务上也存在着严重的自满情绪。甚至从来不参加任何集体学习，也不自学。一部分高级干部不关心政治，学习荒疏，更值得注意改进。社论并响应“人民日报”的号召，要求文学艺术界充分认识提高政治和艺术修养对于发展文学艺术事业的重要性，进一步加强政治和业务学习。
