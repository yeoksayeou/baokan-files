Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 27th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru emphasized the principle of peaceful coexistence at the beginning of the foreign policy debate in the Indian Parliament's Council of States on the 26th.

Nehru said that the solution to the Indochina issue reached in Geneva has aroused a sense of security or "reduced insecurity." The world is moving in the direction of reducing fear and suspicion, gradually moving towards some kind of solution.

Nehru said that using the methods that the planned Southeast Asia Treaty Organization conference may take to solve the problem may cause this fear and suspicion, thereby fueling insecurity. Nehru said that the general concept of the Geneva Conference is that the countries of Indochina should avoid forming military alliances with a powerful group of countries and should belong to the so-called peace zone. If this cannot be achieved, it will be the source of conflict. Nehru believes that holding the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization conference at this time is an unfortunate thing.

Nehru then spoke about Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India. Nehru said that China and India are neighbors with a common border of two thousand miles, and understanding and cooperation between China and India are important. He said: "These two countries have very long histories and have had frequent contact with each other in history. At present, they obviously want to play an important role in Asia - if not in a wider region. It is important for India and China to understand each other and, if possible, cooperate with each other."

Nehru went on to say that he and Premier Zhou Enlai discussed frankly and unreservedly the different political and economic systems of India and China, the extent to which the two countries might contradict each other, and the extent to which each country is willing to tolerate and not interfere in each other's affairs. Nehru said that this meeting gave us many common views on this issue, although within our countries, we may still have differences on how to solve our respective problems. This meeting was not only a pleasure, but also of great benefit to me.

Nehru also mentioned the joint statement issued by Premier Zhou Enlai and himself, as well as the joint statement issued by Premier Zhou Enlai and the Prime Minister of Burma. He said that some other Asian countries also fully agree with this attitude. Nehru said, "This gradual expansion of the Southeast Asian peace zone is an important thing."

    印度总理尼赫鲁强调和平共处的主张
    【新华社新德里二十七日电】印度总理尼赫鲁二十六日在印度国会联邦院外交政策辩论开始时强调和平共处的主张。
    尼赫鲁说，在日内瓦获致的印度支那问题解决的办法已引起安全感或“减轻了不安全感”。世界正向着减少恐惧与怀疑的方向前进，逐渐地走向某种解决。
    尼赫鲁说：用策划中的东南亚公约组织会议可能采取的办法来解决问题，就可能引起这种恐惧和怀疑，从而助长不安全感。尼赫鲁说，日内瓦会议的总的概念是：印度支那各国应该避免与某一强大的国家集团缔结军事联盟，它们应该属于所谓和平地区。假如做不到这一步，那就会是冲突的根源。尼赫鲁认为，在这种时候举行东南亚公约组织会议是不幸的事情。
    尼赫鲁接着谈到了周恩来总理在印度的访问。尼赫鲁说，中国和印度是具有二千英里的共同边界的邻国，中印两国之间的谅解和合作是重要的。他说：“这两个国家都有非常悠久的历史，在历史上彼此有着经常的联系。目前显然它们要在亚洲——如果不是在更广泛的地区——起重要的作用。印度和中国相互了解，并且如果可能的话，彼此进行合作，这是重要的。”
    尼赫鲁接着说，他和周恩来总理开诚布公地、毫不拘束地讨论了印度和中国的不同的政治和经济制度，两个国家彼此会发生矛盾到什么程度、以及每个国家愿容忍并不干预彼此事务到什么程度。尼赫鲁说，这种会谈使我们对于这个问题有了许多共同的看法，尽管在我们的国家内，我们对于如何解决我们各自的问题可能还有分歧。这次会见不仅是件快事，而且给我很大益处。
    尼赫鲁还提到周恩来总理和他自己发表的联合声明，以及周恩来总理和缅甸总理发表的联合声明。他说，有些其他亚洲国家也完全同意这种态度。尼赫鲁说，“东南亚和平地区的这种逐步扩大，是一件重要的事情。”
