The Qiqihar Local State-Owned Heilongjiang No. 1 Machinery Factory has successfully trial-produced a Soviet-style universal cultivator and weeder.

The Soviet-style universal cultivator and weeder can perform inter-row operations for various crops, such as corn, sunflowers, millet, tobacco, hemp, and other crops. It can be used for cultivation and weeding for any crop that is sown using a tractor-pulled 24-row seeder; it can also be used to loosen the soil before sowing. This weeder has very high production efficiency and can cultivate 20 hectares of land every ten hours, with a tillage width of 4.2 to 4.5 meters and a tillage depth of 6 to 16 centimeters.
