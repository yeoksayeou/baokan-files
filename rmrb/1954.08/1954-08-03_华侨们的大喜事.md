A Great Happy Event for Overseas Chinese
　　Ai Ye
    As someone who has worked in overseas news, I am filled with excitement and joy upon the publication of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    All honest and kind people in the world love their motherland and hope for its independence, democracy, prosperity, and strength; especially overseas Chinese, who are far away from their hometown and miss their motherland and care about its fate even more.

    More than a decade ago, I worked in a Chinese newspaper in a foreign country. Compatriots often wrote letters or came to the newspaper in person to tell of their unfortunate experiences. We were deeply moved more than once and used our pens to support them.

    Indeed, those who have never been overseas can hardly imagine the suffering of overseas Chinese. Those who leave their wives and children and travel across the ocean to make a living overseas often find that when they arrive on foreign shores, local police and military, under the pretext of checking for "contraband," openly plunder them, or impose harsh restrictions on entry on the grounds that "Chinese people are prone to carrying infectious germs."

    Even if overseas Chinese manage to find work abroad, they are constantly haunted by hunger, unemployment, and unexpected disasters. In their work and daily lives, they are often subjected to unreasonable abuse, whipping, fines, and imprisonment by local police, military, and capitalists, and even deported.

    In their days of hardship, the vast number of overseas Chinese always hoped that their motherland could become a prosperous and strong nation. Whenever the motherland faced disasters, overseas Chinese always went all out, donating money and sending their children back home to study and serve, hoping that the motherland would overcome the disasters and move towards independence and strength. However, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the money donated by overseas compatriots was pocketed by those bureaucratic politicians. The children who returned home had no books to read and no jobs to find. Overseas Chinese families suffered heavy exploitation. The reactionary Kuomintang government's embassies and consulates abroad turned a blind eye and remained silent to the disasters faced by overseas Chinese, even arrogantly colluding with imperialists to extort and plunder them. I remember that during the "July 7th Incident" in 1937, many overseas Chinese youths, filled with righteous indignation, clamored to return to the country to join the war, but the reactionary Kuomintang's overseas consulates not only failed to provide support and assistance but even shamelessly said: "The motherland has plenty of people. What are you going back for? It is best to hand over the money to the consulate to be remitted back home to help the war effort." Even when the enemy was at the gate, the reactionary Kuomintang shamelessly attempted to continue embezzling donations and preventing overseas Chinese from returning to the country to participate in the war. However, many overseas compatriots persevered and broke through the obstacles and blockades of the reactionary Kuomintang and finally threw themselves into the embrace of the motherland. They deeply realized that freedom and happiness are never obtained out of thin air but must be won through the struggle of the people. Many overseas Chinese youths joined the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the People's Liberation Army. Together with their compatriots at home, they shed their blood and even gave their lives in the flames of liberating the motherland, on the beloved land of the motherland.

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people finally overthrew the reactionary government, eliminated the feudal forces, drove the imperialists out of China, and established the People's Republic of China. On the land of the new China, people are engaged in massive economic construction. The people's lives have been significantly improved. Our great motherland has become one of the world's great powers. Under the care and love of the People's Government, overseas Chinese have their own representatives participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Overseas Chinese residing abroad will also be valued. How can overseas Chinese not cheer for their freedom and happiness, and how can they not be grateful to the great Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government!

    The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, after being discussed and passed by the National People's Congress, will become the fundamental law for making the motherland more prosperous and strong, and the fundamental law for pushing the motherland towards a socialist society. This draft also specifically stipulates that "The People's Republic of China protects the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese." How can the vast number of overseas Chinese not sincerely support and warmly welcome it? If I have the opportunity to revisit overseas and meet overseas Chinese elders, I will extend my heartfelt congratulations to them, congratulating them on the happiness of fulfilling their long-cherished wishes.

    华侨们的大喜事
    艾叶
    作为曾经在海外从事新闻工作的我，对于中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布，满怀着兴奋和喜悦的心情。
    世界上一切正直而善良的人们，没有不热爱自己的祖国，没有不希望祖国独立、民主、繁荣和富强的；尤其是海外华侨，他们远离故乡，更加想念祖国和关怀祖国的命运。
    十几年前，我在国外某地的一家华侨报馆工作，侨胞们经常写信或亲身到报馆来，诉述自己的不幸遭遇。我们曾不止一次地深深感动，也曾经用自己的笔，支援了他们。
    的确，没有到过海外的人，是很难想像到华侨的苦难遭遇的。那些舍妻离子、远渡重洋到海外谋生的人，在抵达异国海岸时，当地军警，往往借口检查“违禁品”，进行公开的掠夺；或借“中国人易带传染病菌”，规定了种种苛刻的限制入境办法。
    华侨即使偶然在海外找到职业，但饥饿、失业和意想不到的灾难，都时刻在追踪着；在劳动和日常生活中，动辄受到当地军警和资本家的无理谩骂、鞭笞、罚金和监禁，直至被驱逐出境。
    广大华侨在苦难的日子里，时刻都希望祖国能够成为富裕和强大的国家。每当祖国有了灾难的时候，国外华侨总是全力以赴：捐献财物，遣送子弟回国学习和服务，期望祖国渡过灾难，走向独立、富强的大道。但在国民党反动统治时代，侨胞们捐献的财物，都被那班官僚政客饱了私囊；回国的子弟，没有书读，没有工作，华侨的家庭遭受着重重剥削；国民党反动政府的驻外使领馆，对于华侨的灾难，熟视无睹，默不作声，甚至狂妄地和帝国主义一道对华侨进行敲诈和掠夺。记得在一九三七年“七七”事变时，多少华侨子弟，激于义愤，纷纷要求返国参战，而国民党反动派的驻外领馆，不但未加支持帮助，反而大言不惭地说：“祖国有的是人，你们回去干什么？最好还是把钱交领馆转寄国内，帮助抗战就行。”在大敌当前的时候，国民党反动派还恬不知耻地，企图继续贪污捐款，阻难华侨回国参加抗战。可是，有不少侨胞坚毅不拔地冲破了国民党反动派的阻难和封锁，终于投进了祖国的怀抱。他们深刻地了解到：自由和幸福绝不是凭空得来的，必须依靠人民的斗争才能获得。许多华侨子弟参加了八路军、新四军以及人民解放军；他们和国内同胞一起，在解放祖国的烽火中，在可爱的祖国土地上，洒出了自己的鲜血，有的甚至献出了自己的生命。
    在中国共产党领导下，中国人民终于推翻了反动政府，消灭了封建势力，把帝国主义驱逐出中国去，建立了中华人民共和国。在新中国的土地上，人们正从事着巨大的经济建设；人民的生活已获得显著改善；我们伟大祖国已成为世界强国之一。在人民政府的关怀和爱护下，华侨有自己的代表人物参加了中国人民政治协商会议；居住在海外的华侨，也将受到人们的重视。你说，华侨们怎能不为自己的自由和幸福而欢呼，怎能不感激伟大的中国共产党和人民政府！
    中华人民共和国宪法草案，经全国人民代表大会讨论通过后，将成为使祖国更加繁荣和富强的根本大法，把祖国推向社会主义社会的根本大法。这个草案中特别又规定了：“中华人民共和国保护国外华侨的正当的权利和利益”。广大华侨又怎能不衷心拥护，热烈欢迎呢？如果我能有机会重游海外，能够有机会碰到华侨父老，我将为他们致以衷心的祝贺，祝贺他们多少年来的宿愿得偿的幸福。
