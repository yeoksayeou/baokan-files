Hunan Province's grain departments have, since June, successively transported over 120 million jin of grain from provinces such as Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, and other regions within the province to the flood-stricken areas along Dongting Lake. The people of the Dongting Lake area have not felt a shortage of grain supply throughout the flood prevention, disaster relief, and production recovery efforts.

The staff of the grain and transportation departments displayed revolutionary fraternal spirit and a high degree of enthusiasm in the grain transfer work. After the grain was transported from other places to Changsha City, the workers of the Changsha Rice Processing Factory and the Hunan Provincial Inland Navigation Bureau, among other relevant units, worked day and night to mill the rice, load it onto ships overnight, and transport it continuously to the disaster areas, braving wind, rain, and turbulent floods. In order to facilitate the purchase of grain by disaster victims, the grain departments adjusted the grain supply points in a timely manner according to the concentration of disaster victims, and universally adopted the method of "using ships as warehouses and points" to supply grain, achieving "wherever the disaster victims are, the grain supply is there." Yiyang City organized more than 20 ships to provide mobile rice supplies, making it as convenient for disaster victims to buy grain as it was in normal times. After the Yin Zhengxing Mutual Aid Team in Sulun Township, Xiangyin County, suffered from the disaster, eight households of farmers were short of ration grain, and the People's Government promptly supplied them with sufficient rice. The whole team's confidence in production and self-salvation was greatly enhanced, and they quickly reclaimed land to plant more than 7,000 sweet potato seedlings and a batch of other miscellaneous grains.

    湖南省调拨粮食支援滨湖地区农民防汛
    湖南省粮食部门从六月份起，先后从四川、贵州、广西、广东等省和本省其他地区运到洞庭湖滨水灾地区一亿二千多万斤粮食。洞庭湖区的人民在防汛抢险和生产救灾中，始终没有感到粮食供应不足。
    粮食部门和交通运输部门的职工在调运粮食的工作中，发挥了革命友爱精神和高度的积极性。当粮食从外地运到长沙市以后，长沙市加工米厂、湖南省内河航运局等有关单位的职工就日夜不息地把米碾好，连夜抢装上船，冒着风雨和汹涌的洪水，源源运到灾区去。为了便利灾民购买粮食，粮食部门根据灾民聚居情况及时调整了粮食供应点，并普遍采用“以船代仓代点”的办法供应粮食，做到了“灾民到那里，粮食供应到那里”。益阳市组织二十多只船，流动供应大米，灾民买粮和平时一样的方便。湘阴县苏仑乡殷正兴互助组受灾以后，有八户农民缺口粮，人民政府及时供应给他们足够的大米。全组生产自救的信心大为提高，很快就开荒种了七千多蔸红薯和一批其他的杂粮。
