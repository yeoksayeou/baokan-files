    Strengthening Supervision of Drug Production by Private Pharmaceutical Factories
    ——Reader’s Letter and Commentary
    Lǐ Míng
    Reader Feng Qian wrote to reflect that the Beijing purchasing group of the Tianjin purchasing and supply station of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation organized a force in early May this year to conduct a spot check on the quality of a batch of ordered goods submitted by more than a dozen private pharmaceutical factories in Beijing, such as Tiancheng and Beihua. It was discovered that many drugs did not meet specifications. For example, some injections contained impurities such as fluff, glass shards, and black spots; some had crystallized, and some had precipitated. After preliminary inspection, it was estimated that defective products accounted for more than 20% of 19 types of injections worth 1.67 billion yuan; the defective rate of "sulfadiazine" submitted by Beihua Pharmaceutical Factory was estimated to be as high as about 80%, and the defective rate of "sodium citrate" also reached 30.9%. Deteriorated drugs have lost part or all of their medical efficacy. If patients are allowed to use them again, it will delay the treatment period, increase the patient's suffering, and even endanger the patient's life. Injecting agents with precipitates and impurities such as glass shards, fluff, and black spots into the human body will cause local redness, swelling, ulcers and other pathological conditions; in severe cases, it will block tiny blood vessels, impede blood circulation, and endanger the patient's life. This batch of drugs has now been returned to the factories for re-inspection.
    According to our investigation, the reader's report is indeed true. The quality of drugs produced by private pharmaceutical factories in Beijing has always been low. The main reason for the poor quality of products is that private pharmaceutical manufacturers disregard the people's health and life in order to pursue illegal profits. The following facts are the best proof:
    In recent years, with the assistance of the government, the production of various private pharmaceutical factories has developed greatly. For example, the production in 1953 increased nine times compared with 1949; however, the production equipment of each factory has rarely been improved. According to a survey in 1953, the production equipment of 18 private pharmaceutical factories in Beijing accounted for only 12% of the total investment, and the simplicity of the equipment can be imagined. For example, when Zhongcheng Pharmaceutical Factory was first established in 1951, it only had 100 million yuan in funds. In 1952, the capital was increased to 300 million yuan, and the year-end balance in 1953 was 1.3 billion yuan; however, when evaporating "calcium bromide," it still used small magnetic basins as in the past, and each batch (400 pounds) of drugs had to be manufactured nearly 200 times. The containers used by each factory to prepare injections are also very small. For example, if a batch of goods is calculated at 10,000 boxes, it must be prepared 25 times. It is difficult to ensure the consistency of specifications and quality for drugs manufactured so many times. The dust prevention equipment in the preparation workshops of each factory is also very poor, especially the lack of double-layer doors and windows. The air is turbid, which seriously affects the cleanliness of the liquid medicine. Some pharmaceutical factories do not have a granulator when making tablet granules, but rub them by hand; many sterilizers and disinfectors are made from waste oil drums, which are not up to standard. However, these private pharmaceutical factories do not consider their own production equipment and technical conditions, but blindly accept and require orders from pharmaceutical companies. As a result, if the task cannot be completed, employees have to work overtime or find temporary workers to rush the work. For example, checking the clarity of injections is a meticulous and important task, but some private pharmaceutical factories in Beijing once asked workers to check more than 5,000 ampoules per person per day, and the inspection time for each injection was less than six seconds. Problems are inevitable with such a fast inspection. The private Beihua Pharmaceutical Factory has no confidence in the manufacture of Vitamin B at all, but blindly accepted the order task from the pharmaceutical company. As a result, more than 80% of the drugs produced have black spots.
    The private pharmaceutical factories in Beijing do not have sound testing institutions. All drug testing relies on a joint testing institute shared by them. The equipment of this joint testing institute is very rudimentary: the so-called "animal breeding room" is just a wire mesh cage next to the kitchen. Because the breeding conditions are not good, the animals are not healthy, which affects the accuracy of the test results; the second testing room is a passage without sunlight and with turbid air, which is not suitable for drug testing work at all; the "physiological measuring device" is made from a waste milk powder iron bucket, and its accuracy and sensitivity are questionable; many testing instruments are also missing. In recent years, drug production has developed rapidly, but the equipment and manpower of the joint testing institute remain the same. Some of the inspection personnel in the institute are also careless and irresponsible, which sometimes not only causes backlogs in inspections, but also often makes mistakes in their work. In addition, the drugs of the same batch number in each factory have to be prepared many times, but only the drugs made in one of the times are sent for inspection, so the inspection work cannot guarantee the quality of the drugs. For example, in May 1953, the private Xinsheng Pharmaceutical Factory falsely reported that the finished product was one million tablets when sending liver tablets for inspection. When the qualified test report was sent to the factory, the batch of drugs had not yet been completed. In June of the same year, the factory falsely reported the quantity of "Suixuesu" sent for inspection as 650 pounds and designated it as one batch number, but in fact, the factory only had 80 jin of raw powder at that time, which could only make 300 pounds of finished products, and only 60 centimeters were made during the inspection, and the rest had not yet started to be manufactured. Another example is that in December last year, the private Limin Pharmaceutical Factory falsely reported the quantity of "calcium chloride," the raw material for medicine, sent for inspection as 4,000 pounds. After inspection, the actual output was only 1,004 pounds. Many of these so-called qualified drugs are actually unqualified. For example, when the "calcium chloride" injection of Kangmin Pharmaceutical Factory was sampled in June last year, it was found that there were three different contents in a box of five ampoules.
    What is more serious is that some private pharmaceutical factories also use methods such as cutting corners and using inferior goods to deceive the people. For example, usually one pound of liver is used to make about three bottles of liver injection, but Qian's Pharmaceutical Factory once made seven bottles from each pound of liver, which was insufficient in ingredients and affected the therapeutic effect. A batch of "digitalis" injection, "glucose" injection and "distilled water" processed by Dacheng Pharmaceutical Factory for the pharmaceutical company in April last year were found to have precipitation after inspection. After this batch of goods was returned by the pharmaceutical company, Wang Dabang, the manager of the factory, did not report to the Public Health Bureau for supervision of the remanufacturing, but sold it to private merchants behind the backs of the employees. Later, when the health authorities conducted spot checks, they found that this batch of "distilled water" also contained "pyrogens," which would inevitably cause patients to feel cold and fever and increase their suffering if injected into the human body.
    The consistent and serious neglect of drug quality by private pharmaceutical factories in Beijing shows that the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Public Health Bureau have not done a good enough job in the past in managing private pharmaceutical factories and supervising drug production, and also exposes the serious shortcomings of the Tianjin purchasing and supply station of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation in the past in ordering goods from private pharmaceutical factories. It should be pointed out that ensuring the quality of drug production is a major issue related to the people's health and life, and no negligence is allowed. The Beijing Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Public Health Bureau should learn from the past lessons and urge the factories to do a good job in the re-inspection of the recently returned drugs. Those that should be remanufactured must be remanufactured, and those that have seriously deteriorated and cannot be remanufactured must be destroyed. More importantly, private pharmaceutical manufacturers should be educated to correct the mistake of neglecting drug quality, and they should take effective measures to improve production equipment and production technology, and rely on the supervision of the workers to ensure that the quality of drugs produced in the future is reliably guaranteed; for those capitalists who have committed serious illegal acts and refuse to correct their mistakes despite repeated education, they should be dealt with according to law. The China National Pharmaceutical Corporation should also correct the past deviation of blindly ordering goods without relying on local governments and without considering the production equipment and technical conditions of each factory in its ordering work, and strengthen inspection to prevent illegal acts by private merchants.

    加强对私营药厂药品生产的监督
    ——读者来信述评
    李明
    读者冯谦来信反映：中国医药公司天津采购供应站北京收购组在今年五月初曾组织力量，对北京市天成、北华等十数家私营药厂所交一批订货的质量作了一次抽查，发现很多药品不合规格，如有的注射剂中含有毛毛、玻璃屑、黑点等杂质，有的已经结晶，有的已经沉淀。经初步检查，在十九种价值十六亿七千多万元的注射剂中，估计残品占百分之二十以上；北华药厂所交“磺胺嘧啶”估计残品率高达百分之八十左右，“构橼酸钠”残品也达百分之三十点九。变质的药品，已经失去一部或全部医疗效力，如果再让病人使用，就会拖延治疗期，增加病人的痛苦，甚至贻误病人的生命。沉淀及有玻璃屑、毛毛、黑点等杂质的药剂注入人体后，轻则会引起局部红肿、溃烂等病态；重则会阻塞微细的血管，使血液流通不畅，使病者发生生命危险。现在这批药品已退回各药厂进行复检。
    据我们调查了解，读者反映的情况是确实的。北京市各私营制药厂所生产的药品，历来是质量不高。造成产品质量低劣的原因，主要是各私营制药厂商为了追求非法利润，而漠视人民的身体健康和生命危险。以下事实就是最好的证明：
    几年来各私营药厂在政府的扶助下，生产都有了很大的发展，如一九五三年的生产即比一九四九年增加了九倍；但各厂的生产设备却很少改进，据一九五三年调查，北京市十八家私营制药厂的生产设备仅占总投资额的百分之十二，其简陋情况可想而知。如忠诚药厂在一九五一年刚成立时，只有一亿元资金，到一九五二年增资至三亿元，到一九五三年年终结存为十三亿元；但在蒸发“溴化钙”时，还是像过去一样使用小磁盆，每批（四百磅）药品就得分做将近二百次制造。各厂配制注射液所使用的容器也都很小，如一批货以一万盒计算，就要配制二十五次，这样多次制成的药品，规格质量就很难保证一致。各厂配制车间的避尘设备也很差，特别是缺乏双层门窗，空气污浊，严重影响了药液的洁净。有些药厂在制片剂颗粒时，没有颗粒机，而用手搓；灭菌消毒器很多是用废油桶改造的，很不合乎标准。但是，这些私营药厂不考虑本身的生产设备和技术条件，却盲目接受和要求医药公司订货，结果任务不能完成，就要职工加班加点或者找临时工赶制。如检查注射液澄明度本是一件细致而重要的工作，可是北京市有些私营药厂曾让工人每人每天检查五千多枝，每枝注射剂的检查时间还不到六秒钟，这么快的检查工作就难免不出问题了。私营北华药厂对乙种维他命的制造根本没有把握，但也盲目接受医药公司的订货任务，结果制出的药品百分之八十以上都有黑点。
    北京市各私营药厂本身都没有健全的化验机构，所有的药品检验都依靠他们共有的一个联合检验所。这个联合检验所的设备很简陋：所谓“动物饲养室”只是厨房旁边的一个铁丝网笼，因为饲养条件不好，动物都不健康，就影响了试验结果的准确性；第二检验室是一个通道，没有阳光，空气污浊，根本不宜于药品检验工作；“生理测定器”是用废乳粉铁桶改制的，准确性和敏度都成问题；检验仪器缺少的也很多。几年来药品生产发展很快，而联合检验所的设备和人力还依然如故。该所部分检验人员工作作风又是粗枝大叶，不够负责，以致有时不但会造成检体积压现象，而且还常常在工作上发生错误。再加上各厂同一批号的药品要分好多次配料制成，但送检的只是其中一次所制的药品，检验工作也就不能保证药品的质量了。如一九五三年五月份私营新生药厂送检肝片时，虚报制成品为一百万片，等化验合格的报告书交到厂时，这批药品还未制完。同年六月份该厂送检“睟液素”时，将制成品数量虚报为六百五十磅，并定为一个批号，而实际上该厂当时仅存原粉八十斤，只能制三百磅成品，并且在送检时只制出六十公分，其余部分还未动工制造。又如去年十二月份私营利民药厂送检制药原料“氯化钙”时，虚报制成数量为四千磅，经检查实际产量仅为一千零四磅。这种所谓已经检验合格的药品，实际上有不少是不合格的。如去年六月抽验康民药厂“氯化钙”注射液时，发现一盒五枝就有三种不同的含量。
    更严重的是，有些私营药厂还用偷工减料，以劣货充好货等办法来欺骗人民。如通常都是一斤肝制三瓶左右肝注射液，但钱氏药厂曾将每斤肝制成七瓶，成分不足，影响了治疗效果。大成药厂在去年四月为医药公司加工的一批“洋地黄”注射液、
  “葡萄糖”注射液和“蒸馏水”，经检查证明都有沉淀现象。这批货被医药公司退回后，该厂经理王大帮没有报请公共卫生局监督改制，却瞒着职工卖给私商了。后来卫生机关在进行抽验时，发现这批
  “蒸馏水”里还含有“热原”，如果注入人体，必然会使病人发冷和发烧，增加痛苦。
    北京市各私营药厂一贯严重忽视药品质量的恶劣行为，说明了北京市人民政府工商管理局、公共卫生局过去对私营药厂的管理和药品生产的监督工作做得不够好，同时也暴露了中国医药公司天津采购供应站过去在向私营药厂订货工作中的严重缺点。应该指出：保证药品生产的质量，是与人民身体健康和生命相关的大事，决不允许有丝毫的忽视。北京市人民政府工商管理局和公共卫生局应该接受过去的教训，督促各厂做好最近这批被退回的药品的复检工作，应该改制的必须改制，那些严重变质而又无法改制的就必须销毁。更重要的是，应该教育私营制药厂商纠正忽视药品质量的错误，要他们采取有效措施，改进生产设备和生产技术，并且依靠工人群众的监督，使今后生产的药品质量得到
  可靠的保证；对于某些有严重违法行为而又屡教不改的资本家，应该依法处理。中国医药公司在订货工作中也应该纠正过去不依靠当地政府和不根据各厂的生产设备和技术条件就盲目订货的偏向，并加强检查，防止私商的违法行为。
