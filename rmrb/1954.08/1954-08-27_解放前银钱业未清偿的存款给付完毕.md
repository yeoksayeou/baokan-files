Outstanding Payments of Pre-Liberation Silver and Money Shops' Deposits Completed

The work of paying out outstanding deposits from pre-liberation silver and money shops has been completed nationwide. According to statistics from only 546 payment locations (payment points in seven provinces, including Anhui, Hebei, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Hubei, are not yet included in the statistics), more than 393,000 depositors have been compensated, with a total compensation of more than 377.7 billion yuan.

Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government implemented a policy of malignant inflation in its controlled areas. Between 1937 and 1948, prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas rose more than 1.26 million times, effectively plundering the deposits of ordinary depositors in banks at the time. On the eve of the national liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government also stole all the bank's assets, turning the deposit slips of the vast number of depositors into mere scraps of paper. After liberation, the People's Government, considering that these deposits were related to the vital interests of the vast number of depositors, decided to appropriately resolve this old debt left over by the Kuomintang reactionary government, under the condition that the state's financial situation permitted. In February 1953, the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Measures for Paying Outstanding Deposits of Pre-Liberation Silver and Money Shops." In June of the same year, People's Banks, jointly owned public-private banks, and private banks in various parts of the country simultaneously began to make payments. After eight months of effort, this social problem that had been delayed for more than ten years was completely and reasonably resolved.

The depositors were overjoyed when they received their long-abandoned deposits, and unanimously thanked the People's Government for this measure. Sun Fengxian, a depositor in Taiyuan, said: "Only the government led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can be so concerned about the interests of the people at all times. I must respond to the government's call with practical actions, use the money I received for production or deposit it in the National Bank to support our country's industrial construction." Wang Guoxiang, an overseas Chinese depositor, wrote from overseas: "The People's Government cares for the people meticulously. Overseas Chinese are proud and happy that the motherland has such a great government." After withdrawing their deposits, the vast majority of depositors, in addition to keeping some as production funds and living expenses, deposited the remainder in the People's Bank. According to statistics from Jiangsu Province, the highest rate of voluntary savings among depositors in some areas reached 80% of the total cash payment, and generally reached more than 60%.

### 解放前银钱业未清偿的存款给付完毕

    解放前银钱业未清偿的存款给付完毕
    解放前银钱业未清偿存款的给付工作，已在全国范围内办理完毕。仅据五百四十六个清偿地点（安徽、河北、江西、广西、湖北等七个省的清偿点还没有统计在内）的统计，共有三十九万三千多个存户得到偿还，偿还款共计三千七百七十七亿多元。
    解放以前，国民党反动政府在其统治区内实行恶性通货膨胀的政策，在一九三七年到一九四八年期间，国民党统治区的物价上涨了一百二十六万多倍，这就把当时一般存户在银行的存款实际上掠夺净尽了。全国解放前夕，国民党反动政府又把银行资财盗窃一空，使广大存户的存单完全变成了废纸。解放后，人民政府鉴于这些存款关系到广大存户的切身利益，在国家财政情况允许的条件下，决定适当地解决这笔国民党反动政府遗留下来的旧债。一九五三年二月，中央人民政府政务院颁布了“关于解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法”，同年六月，全国各地人民银行以及公私合营银行和私营银行同时开始给付。经过八个月的努力，这个拖延了十多年的社会问题完全合情合理地解决了。
    存户们领到他们的早已绝望了的存款，真是喜出望外，一致感激人民政府这一措施。太原存户孙凤先说：“只有毛主席和共产党领导的政府，才能这样时刻为人民的利益打算。我一定要用实际行动响应政府的号召，把领到的钱用之于生产或存入国家银行，支援我们国家的工业建设。”华侨存户王国祥从海外来信说：“人民政府爱护人民无微不至，海外侨胞以祖国有这样伟大的政府而骄傲、高兴。”绝大部分存户在取出存款后，除了留下一部分作为生产资金和生活费用外，余下的大都存入人民银行。据江苏省统计，存户主动储蓄的数字最高地区达到付现总数的百分之八十，一般地区也达到百分之六十以上。（新华社）
