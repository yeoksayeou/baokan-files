    The Power Guiding All Ethnic Groups Forward
    Xu Bingchun

    In the past few days, exciting news has continuously spread from Hohhot, the blue city that the people of Inner Mongolia are paying attention to. From the afternoon of July 27th to July 30th, the representatives of all ethnic groups and circles who participated in the first session of the First People's Congress of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region studied and discussed the draft constitution with incomparable joy.

    Among all the representatives, there are ten different ethnic groups. This meeting itself fully illustrates that the people of all ethnic groups and circles in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have truly gained the right to be masters of their own affairs. People's Representative Li Zhagen comes from the old revolutionary base area. He remembers that since the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, many revolutionary workers organized the masses to fight the Japanese devils in the Huazi Mountain Panlonggou area. The Japanese devils killed and set fires in that area, and many cadres died at the hands of the Japanese. Therefore, he deeply understands that the rights that the people have gained today were exchanged for the lives and blood of those martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the arduous struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. He said: "We must not let the blood of the martyrs flow in vain, and we must protect the fruits of the revolution." Mo Rigetze, an agricultural labor model who had been to the Soviet Union, said: There was also a constitution before liberation, but that was a constitution that oppressed the people. Now, our draft constitution stipulates the people's right to manage state affairs, and also points out to us the grand goal of building a socialist society. According to the provisions of the draft constitution, the minority nationalities of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with the help of the advanced nationality, the Han nationality, will gradually transition to a better socialist society.

    The draft constitution stipulates that all ethnic groups in the country are equal, and that all minority nationalities in the country, under the unified leadership of the central government, shall develop their own political, economic, and cultural undertakings in accordance with the characteristics of each nationality. Wang Qingsurong, a representative of the people of Ulanqab League, has a very deep understanding of these provisions. After liberation, the people of Ulanqab League ended their tragic life under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and after several years of construction, they have changed their past poverty-stricken appearance. The most telling example of this situation is that the number of livestock in this league in 1953 increased by 137.2 percent compared with 1950. The development of production has also brought about the development of cultural, educational, and health undertakings. In 1953, the number of students in the entire league increased twentyfold compared with before liberation. In terms of medical services, there is already a hospital, five health centers, six health stations, and thirty-five midwifery stations. The development of cultural and health undertakings has made the current grasslands appear with a thriving atmosphere for both people and livestock. Wang Qingsurong said gratefully: "These have all been achieved under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. With the constitution, we can ensure that our minority nationalities live a happier life in the big family of the Chinese nation."

    In the speeches of the representatives, full confidence in building a socialist society was demonstrated. This confidence is concentrated in the speech of Hu Heletai, a well-known model worker in animal husbandry. This herdsman, who had been a slave to herdsmen owners on the Hulunbuir grasslands since he was eleven years old and did not gain personal freedom until the Communist Party liberated the grasslands, formed a seasonal hay-cutting mutual aid group with four herdsmen who had previously provided temporary mutual assistance when he cut sheep grass in 1950. At that time, there were a total of thirty-two livestock and nineteen carts. When the Hulunbuir League People's Government loaned them four hundred sheep, they decided to change the seasonal hay-cutting mutual aid group into a permanent mutual aid group and use the four hundred sheep as public property for joint management. Because they were organized, concentratedly used labor, and overcame natural disasters such as wind and snow, Hu Heletai's mutual aid group did not lose a single livestock in the snowstorms of the winter of 1951 and the spring of 1952. They also paid attention to improving livestock breeds. After being organized, the production of the Hu Heletai animal husbandry production mutual aid group has greatly developed. By this year, the whole group has thirteen households with more than 1,500 livestock. The lives of the group members have also been greatly improved. In accordance with various conditions and the principle of voluntariness, they have now established an animal husbandry production cooperative. Based on his life experience, Hu Heletai said in his speech: The draft constitution is a guarantee for building a socialist society. Now, I have recognized the development prospects of the animal husbandry production cooperative and increased my confidence and strength in building socialism.

    Among the representatives who spoke in the discussion were workers from the iron and steel industrial base and workers from the Greater Khingan Range forest industrial front, the Oroqen people who live in the deep mountains and dense forests and are good at riding and hunting, people's meritorious who participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, loyal revolutionary cadres, representatives from the literary and art circles and scientific workers, and women who were oppressed in the old society. They all fully expressed their opinions.

    The most striking impression of the discussion is that after discussing the draft constitution, the people's representatives all expressed their determination to support the draft constitution with practical actions. Hu Heletai, a model worker in animal husbandry, made a guarantee, saying: "After returning, in addition to continuing to study the draft constitution myself, I will also publicize it to the herdsmen. In future production, we will strengthen the unity within the animal husbandry production cooperative and lead the members to fight against wind and snow disasters, ensuring a continuous increase in livestock to support the country's industrialization construction."

    Many representatives also put forward action guarantees to support the draft constitution at the discussion. These guarantees show that the draft constitution has become the power to guide the people of all ethnic groups and circles in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region forward.

专栏：广大人民热烈讨论宪法草案

    引导各族人民前进的力量
    徐柄春
    几天来，从这座内蒙古人民关注着的蓝色之城——呼和浩特，不断传出令人振奋的消息。由七月二十七日下午起到七月三十日，参加内蒙古自治区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议的各族各界人民代表以无比喜悦的心情学习和讨论了宪法草案。
    在全体代表中，包括十个不同的民族。这个会议本身就充分说明了内蒙古自治区各族各界人民真正获得了当家作主的权利。人民代表李扎根是从老革命根据地来的。他记得从抗日战争开始后，有很多革命工作人员在花子山盘龙沟一带组织群众打日本鬼子，日本鬼子在那一带杀人放火，有不少干部死在日本人手里，因而他深刻地懂得，今天人民得到的权利，是那些在抗日战争中和同国民党反动派艰苦斗争中牺牲的先烈们的生命和鲜血换来的。他说：“我们不能让烈士们的血白流，一定要好好保卫革命的胜利果实。”曾经到过苏联的农业劳动模范莫日格策说：在解放前也有过宪法，但是那是压迫人民的宪法。现在我们的宪法草案中规定了人民管理国家大事的权利，并且还给我们指出了建设社会主义社会的远大目标，按照宪法草案的规定，内蒙古自治区的少数民族，在先进民族汉族的帮助下将逐步过渡到美好的社会主义社会。
    宪法草案规定国内各民族一律平等，规定国内各少数民族在中央统一领导下，根据各民族特点发展本民族的政治、经济和文化事业；对于这些规定，乌兰察布盟的人民代表旺庆苏荣体会得非常深刻。解放后乌兰察布盟人民结束了过去在国民党反动派统治下的悲惨生活，经过几年来的建设已经改变了过去的贫困面貌。最可以说明这个情况的是在一九五三年这个盟的牲畜数已经比一九五○年增加了百分之一百三十七点二；生产的发展也带来了文教卫生事业的发展，一九五三年全盟的学生比解放前增加了二十倍。在医疗事业方面已经有了一所医院、五个卫生所、六个保健站和三十五个接生站。文化和卫生事业的发展使得现在的草原出现了人畜两旺的气象。旺庆苏荣感激地说：“这些都是在共产党和毛主席的正确领导下得到的，有了宪法，就可以保证我们少数民族在中国这个民族大家庭里生活得更加幸福。”
    在代表们的发言中，充分显示了对建设社会主义社会的信心。这个信心在著名的牧业劳动模范胡和勒泰的发言里集中地表现出来。这位从十一岁就在呼伦贝尔草原上给牧主当奴隶，一直到共产党解放了草原的时候才有了人身自由的牧民，在一九五○年打羊草时，他和过去临时互助的四户牧民组成季节性的打草互助组。当时共有三十二头牲畜、十九辆车。当呼伦贝尔盟人民政府贷给他们四百只羊时，他们就决定把季节性的打草互助组改变为常年不散的互助组，把四百只羊作为公共财产，共同经营。由于组织起来，集中地使用劳动力，战胜了风、雪等自然灾害，胡和勒泰互助组的牲畜在一九五一年冬天和一九五二年春季的暴风雪中没有损失过一头。他们还注意改良牲畜品种。组织起来后，胡和勒泰牧业生产互助组的生产是大大地发展了，到今年全组已有十三户人家有牲畜一千五百多头。组内生活也普遍大大提高了。依照各种条件和自愿的原则，现在他们已经成立了牧业生产合作社。胡和勒泰根据他生活上的体验在发言时说：宪法草案是建设社会主义社会的保证。现在，我认清了牧业生产合作社的发展前途，增加了我对建设社会主义的信心和力量。
    在讨论中发言的代表还有来自钢铁工业基地和来自大兴安岭森林工业战线上的工人，有住在深山密林、善骑善猎的鄂伦春人，也有参加过抗美援朝战争的人民功臣，有忠心耿耿的革命干部，也有文艺界代表和科学工作者，还有旧社会受压迫的妇女，他们都充分地表达了自己的意见。
    讨论会给人最鲜明的印象，就是人民代表在讨论过宪法草案之后，都表示了要用实际行动拥护宪法草案的决心。牧业劳动模范胡和勒泰提出保证说：“回去后除了自己继续学习宪法草案外，还要向牧民们进行宣传。在今后生产中加强牧业生产合作社社内的团结，领导社员向风雪灾害进行斗争，保证不断增加牲畜以支援国家的工业化建设。”
    很多代表在讨论会上也都提出了拥护宪法草案的行动保证。这些保证说明了宪法草案已经成为引导内蒙古自治区各族各界人民前进的力量。
