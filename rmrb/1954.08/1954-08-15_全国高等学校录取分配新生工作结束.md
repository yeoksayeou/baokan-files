The national higher education enrollment and new student allocation work has been completed. This year, all types of higher education institutions across the country have enrolled more than 94,000 new students, fully completing this year's higher education enrollment plan. The list of admitted students will be announced on the 18th in the Central South region, and simultaneously on the 15th in all other regions. Each higher education institution has also sent admission notices and welcome letters to the admitted students, warmly expecting them to register and begin their studies on time.

This year, the national unified higher education entrance examination saw over 130,000 applicants, including more than 26,700 graduates from workers' and peasants' short-term middle schools, in-service cadres, and demobilized military cadres, accounting for over 20% of the total number of applicants. 94,000 new students were admitted, fully completing the enrollment plan. The examination scores and political quality of the admitted students have improved compared to last year; particularly, because many in-service cadres applied to various schools of liberal arts, political science, law, and economics according to the needs of the country and their personal strengths, the political quality and examination scores of new students in these schools have significantly improved.

This year, in the national unified higher education entrance examination, students' choices of majors generally aligned with the needs of national construction. The vast majority of applicants expressed that when there is a conflict between the needs of the country and personal aspirations, they are willing to accept the state's allocation. Among the 2,872 applicants in the Zhangzhou examination area of East China, 2,864 expressed their willingness to accept state allocation, reaching over 99% of the total. During the admission and allocation period, many candidates wrote letters to the enrollment committees of various higher education institutions, expressing their determination to obey the allocation. Two candidates from the Qingdao examination area, originally demobilized military cadres, said: We are soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. This year, we are applying in Qingdao, and for the sake of the motherland's socialist construction, we are willing to unconditionally obey the state's planned allocation. On this basis, the higher education enrollment committees in various regions were able to smoothly admit and allocate each candidate who met the admission requirements based on the needs of national construction, and with reference to the candidates' aspirations for further education, from all aspects of political quality, health, and academic examination scores. In addition, when enrolling new students, the higher education enrollment committees in various regions gave lenient admission to graduates from workers' and peasants' short-term middle schools, in-service cadres, and demobilized military cadres who met certain conditions; they also gave appropriate consideration to returned overseas Chinese students and ethnic minority students. And according to the needs of the country's socialist construction and the young people's determination to resolutely obey the state's allocation, planned allocation was carried out for some departments and majors with fewer applicants, such as geology and exploration, mining exploitation and management, biology, meteorology, Russian, and teacher training, ensuring the completion of the enrollment plans for these departments and majors.

    全国高等学校录取分配新生工作结束
    今年全国高等学校招生的录取分配工作已经结束，全国各类高等学校共录取新生九万四千多人，全部完成了今年高等学校的招生计划。录取新生名单，除中南区十八日公布外，其余各地区都在十五日同时公布。各高等学校也向各校录取的新生，发出录取通知书和欢迎信，热情地期待着录取的新生按时报到入学。
    今年，全国高等学校统一招生，报考者共十三万多人，其中工农速成中学毕业生、在职干部和转业军事干部共二万六千七百多人，占报考总数百分之二十强。录取新生九万四千人，全部完成招生计划。录取学生的考试成绩和政治质量，都比去年有所提高；特别是由于很多在职干部根据国家需要及个人所长报考文史、政法、财经各类学校，使得这类学校新生的政治质量和考试成绩，更有显著提高。
    今年全国高等学校统一招生中，学生报考志愿大致符合国家建设需要，绝大多数报考青年都表示：当国家需要和个人志愿有矛盾时，愿意接受国家分配。华东漳州考区报名投考的二千八百七十二人中，表示愿意接受国家分配的就有二千八百六十四人，达总数百分之九十九强。在录取分配期间，还有很多考生写信给各高等学校招生工作委员会，表示服从分配的决心。青岛考区两个原系转业军事干部的考生说：我们是人民解放军的一员战士，今年在青岛报考，为了祖国社会主义建设，愿无条件服从国家计划分配。在这个基础上，各地高等学校招生工作委员会得以顺利地根据国家建设需要、参照考生升学志愿，从政治、健康及学科考试成绩等各方面，来录取分配每一个合于入学要求的考生。此外，各地高等学校招生工作委员会在录取新生时，对于工农速成中学毕业生、在职干部和转业军事干部，合于一定条件者，从宽录取；对于归国华侨学生和少数民族学生也给予适当的照顾。并根据国家的社会主义建设的需要和青年们坚决服从国家分配的意志，对于有些报考人数较少的系科，如地质和勘探、矿藏的开采与经营、生物学、气象、俄语和师范，进行了计划分配，保证这些系科招生计划的完成。　（新华社）
