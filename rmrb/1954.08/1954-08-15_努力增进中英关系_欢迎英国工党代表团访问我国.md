Strive to Enhance Sino-British Relations
——Welcome the British Labour Party Delegation to Visit Our Country

The British Labour Party delegation, led by Labour Party leader Clement Attlee, arrived in Beijing yesterday at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese people extend a warm welcome to the British Labour Party delegation's visit to our country. This is an important event in Sino-British relations in recent years.

Both China and the United Kingdom are major countries in the world; the people of China and the United Kingdom have friendly ties and friendship. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Sino-British relations began to be established on a new basis. During the Geneva Conference, Sino-British relations improved due to the efforts of both countries. The governments of China and the United Kingdom have reached an agreement that the Chinese government has decided to send a chargé d'affaires to London. The British government has also shown a positive attitude towards improving Sino-British relations. British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden pointed out in a speech in the British House of Commons on June 23 this year: "The contacts between the Chinese and British delegations in Geneva have undoubtedly been valuable;" and believed that: "These talks have proven beneficial to our country." Broad circles of people in Britain generally have a sincere desire to develop Sino-British relations and promote Sino-British trade. British Labour Party leader Clement Attlee told reporters in Stockholm on August 9, on his way to our country, that he hoped to bring back "friendship and peace" from China. A British Labour Party Executive Committee member, Aneurin Bevan, also wrote in an article entitled "Why We Are Going to China" published in the British "Tribune" weekly on June 4: The British Labour Party delegation hopes to find "the possibility of friendly exchanges and effective cooperation in China." The visit of the British Labour Party delegation to China is a manifestation of the British public and public opinion demanding the development of Sino-British relations.

Our government and people are willing to develop peaceful and cooperative relations with the governments and people of any country. The great revolution carried out by the Chinese people is to build a prosperous and happy life for themselves. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China five years ago, the Chinese people have been actively engaged in peaceful construction and have achieved significant achievements; at the same time, they have strived for peace in order to enhance peaceful and cooperative relations with countries around the world. Our country's foreign policy is to maintain world peace and cooperate with all countries. One of the important principles of our country's foreign policy is to establish and develop diplomatic relations with any country based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. This principle naturally also applies to Sino-British relations. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai stated when answering questions from British Labour Party General Secretary Morgan Phillips on July 19 this year: "The Chinese government and people deeply desire that Sino-British relations can be further enhanced on the existing basis, and are willing to work together with the British government and people to develop mutual economic and cultural exchanges, so that the friendly relations between the two peoples can be strengthened." Premier Zhou Enlai's words are a sincere expression of our government and people's desire to develop Sino-British relations.

The social and political systems of China and the United Kingdom are different, but the people of both countries desire peace and are willing to coexist peacefully. This common desire is the foundation for enhancing and developing relations between the two countries. Our country has always advocated that countries with different social systems should coexist peacefully, and advocates that countries in Asia and the world should work together on this basis to maintain collective peace in Asia and the world. The joint statements issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma in late June this year set an example for the relationship of peaceful coexistence between Asian and world countries. The joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma defined five principles, namely: mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The Resolution of the Central People's Government Committee on the Approval of the Foreign Affairs Report of Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs, believes that these five principles should be applied to the relations between our country and Asian and world countries. The joint statement of the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers has been warmly welcomed and supported by many countries in Asia and around the world. International public opinion believes that by recognizing the above-mentioned five principles and acting in accordance with these principles, countries with different social systems in Asia and the world can coexist peacefully, and the collective peace of Asia and the world can be guaranteed. Especially after the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, there are more and more countries in the world that advocate peaceful coexistence. Many political leaders in Western countries also believe that peaceful coexistence with China is an important factor in further consolidating peace in Asia and the world. British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden believes that the improvement of Sino-British relations is conducive to peaceful coexistence. British Labour Party leader Clement Attlee stated in a speech in the British Parliament on July 14 that the British Labour Party advocates peaceful coexistence and believes that "the attitude towards China is a test." This view of British political leaders is very reasonable. Because China and the United Kingdom both have significant roles and influence in international affairs, developing mutual relations between China and the United Kingdom under the principle of peaceful coexistence is naturally conducive to the collective peace of Asia and the world.

An important factor in the development of Sino-British relations is the normalization of Sino-British trade. Sino-British trade has a long history; since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people and the Chinese government have attached great importance to developing and expanding trade exchanges between China and the United Kingdom on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The prospects for Sino-British trade are very broad. However, the development of Sino-British trade is still subject to man-made obstacles. This obstacle is caused by the so-called "embargo" policy forcibly implemented by the United States. Another reason why Sino-British trade has not been able to develop further is that the US Navy controls the high seas of the Far East and instructs the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to intercept merchant ships coming to China. Since 1950, as many as dozens of British merchant ships have been intercepted or detained. It can be seen that to greatly develop Sino-British trade, these obstacles must be eliminated.

The current international situation is developing towards a future conducive to the establishment of collective peace in Asia and the world, and many countries in Asia and the world are working towards this end. However, the warmongers in the US ruling clique are bent on opposing collective peace and are trying to establish opposing military blocs in Asia and around the world to create division and tension in various regions of Asia and the world. Since the end of the Geneva Conference, the United States has stepped up its steps to establish such a military alliance in Asia. On the one hand, the United States is trying to put together a Southeast Asian aggressive group, and on the other hand, it is also trying to drag Japan into the so-called "Northeast Asian Defense Alliance" organized together with South Korea and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek in order to form an encirclement against China. This policy of the United States completely violates the principle of peaceful coexistence of Asian and world countries and increasingly poses a serious threat to peace and security in Asia and the world. The Chinese people and the people of Asian countries resolutely oppose the US policy of clamoring for and creating new wars. India and Indonesia oppose the US policy of piecing together a Southeast Asian aggressive group, and Burma and Ceylon have also expressed their refusal to join this group; at the same time, the US warmongers' plan to organize a Northeast Asian military alliance has not aroused the expected reaction in Japan. All this clearly shows that the attempt to pursue a policy of hostility towards China and create new wars in Asia has no future. The desire of the people of Asia and the world for peace cannot be ignored.

After a long and arduous struggle, the Chinese people established our great country. In just five short years, we have begun to change the face of our country, which has naturally surprised many foreign visitors who are used to seeing the old China. However, we know, and many of our friends also know, that we still have difficulties ahead, and we still need to heal the many wounds left by the old China. There are still many shortcomings in our work that we need to constantly strive to correct. We have full confidence in doing these tasks well, and we also need the guidance of our friends.

We hope that the British Labour Party delegation will see what they want to see during their visit to China. We will be happy to help them fulfill their wishes. This will increase the understanding of China by British Labour Party members and broad circles of people in Britain, and will therefore play an important role in enhancing Sino-British friendly relations, which will also be of great benefit to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    努力增进中英关系
    ——欢迎英国工党代表团访问我国
    应中国人民外交学会的邀请来我国访问的英国工党代表团，在英国工党领袖艾德礼的率领下，已于昨日到达北京。我国人民对英国工党代表团来我国访问，表示热忱的欢迎。这是近年来中英关系中的一件重要事情。
    中英两国都是世界上的大国；中英两国人民有着友好的联系和友谊。在中华人民共和国成立之后，中英两国关系在新的基础上开始建立。在日内瓦会议期间，由于中英两国的努力，中英关系有了改进。中英两国政府已取得协议，中国政府决定派遣代办前往伦敦。英国政府对于改进中英关系也表现了积极的态度。英国外交大臣艾登今年六月二十三日在英国下院的发言中曾指出：“（中英）两国代表团在日内瓦进行的接触无疑是有价值的”；并认为：“这些会谈已经证明对我国是有利的”。英国广泛的各界人士对于发展中英关系和促进中英贸易，普遍怀有真诚愿望。英国工党领袖艾德礼八月九日在前来我国的途中，在斯德哥尔摩向记者表示，他希望从中国带回“友谊与和平”。英国工党执行委员会委员比万在六月四日的英国“论坛”周刊发表的一篇题目为“我们为什么要到中国去”的文章中，也写道：英国工党代表团希望在“中国找到友好交往和有效合作的可能性”。英国工党代表团来中国访问，正是英国公众和舆论要求发展中英关系的表现。
    我国政府和人民愿意和任何国家的政府和人民发展和平合作的关系。我国人民进行的伟大革命，是为了建设自己繁荣幸福的生活。自中华人民共和国成立的五年以来，我国人民一面积极进行和平建设，并取得了重大的成就；一面努力争取和平，以增进与世界各国和平合作的关系。我国的外交政策是维护世界和平和与各国合作的政策。我国外交政策的重要原则之一，就是根据平等、互利、互相尊重领土主权的原则，同任何国家建立和发展外交关系。这个原则自然也适用于中英两国的关系。我国周恩来总理在今年七月十九日答复英国工党总书记菲利浦斯的问题的时候，就曾表示：“中国政府和人民深愿中英关系能够在现有的基础上获得进一步的增进，并愿与英国政府和人民共同努力，发展相互之间的经济往来和文化交流，使两国人民之间的友好关系得以加强。”周恩来总理的话是我国政府和人民谋求发展中英关系的真诚表示。
    中英两国的社会和政治制度是不同的，但是两国人民都愿望和平，都愿意和平共处。这种共同的愿望就是增进和发展两国关系的基础。我国一向主张社会制度不同的国家应当和平共处，并且主张亚洲及世界各国在这个基础上共同努力维护亚洲及世界的集体和平。今年六月下旬发表的中印两国总理和中缅两国总理的联合声明，为亚洲及世界各国和平共处的关系树立了榜样。中印两国总理和中缅两国总理的联合声明，确定了五项原则，这就是：互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利及和平共处。我国中央人民政府委员会在关于批准政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来的外交报告的决议中，认为这五项原则应该适用于我国和亚洲及世界各国的关系中。中印总理和中缅总理的联合声明得到亚洲许多国家及世界各国的热烈欢迎和支持。各国舆论认为承认上述的五项原则并按照这些原则办事，亚洲及世界上社会制度不同的国家就能够和平共处，亚洲及世界的集体和平就能够得到保障。特别是在日内瓦会议取得关于恢复印度支那和平的协议之后，世界上赞成和平共处的国家是越来越多了。西方国家的许多政治领袖也都认为与中国和平共处，是进一步巩固亚洲及世界和平的重要因素。英国外交大臣艾登认为中英关系的改进有助于和平共处。英国工党领袖艾德礼七月十四日在英国议会发表的演说中，曾表示英国工党主张和平共处，并认为“对待中国的态度是一个考验”。英国政治领袖的这种意见，是十分合理的。因为中英两国在国际事务中都有着重大的作用和影响，中英两国在和平共处的原则下发展相互之间的关系，自然有利于亚洲及世界的集体和平。
    发展中英关系的一个重要因素，是中英贸易的正常化。中英贸易有悠久的历史；自中华人民共和国成立以来，中国人民和中国政府很重视在平等互利的基础上发展和扩大中英之间的贸易往来。中英贸易的前途是十分广大的。但是，中英贸易的发展却还受着人为的障碍。这种障碍是由于美国强制推行的所谓“禁运”政策造成的。中英贸易所以没有能够进一步发展的另一个原因，是美国海军控制了远东公海，指使蒋介石卖国贼拦劫前来中国的商船。自一九五○年以来，仅英国商船被拦劫或扣留的即达数十艘之多。由此可见，要大量发展中英贸易，就必须消除这种障碍。
    目前的国际形势正朝着有利于建立亚洲及世界的集体和平的前途发展，亚洲及世界许多国家都正为此而努力。但是美国统治集团中的好战分子偏偏不要集体和平，而力图在亚洲及世界各处建立对立的军事集团，以造成亚洲及世界各个地区的分裂和紧张局势。自日内瓦会议结束以来，美国在亚洲建立这种军事联盟的步骤更为加紧了。美国一面在努力拼凑东南亚侵略集团，一面还企图把日本拉进与南朝鲜和蒋介石卖国贼一起组织的所谓“东北亚防御联盟”中，以形成对中国的包围。美国这种政策，完全违反了亚洲及世界各国和平共处的原则，日益造成对亚洲及世界和平和安全的严重威胁。中国人民和亚洲各国人民坚决反对美国叫嚣和制造新战争的政策。印度、印尼都反对美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团的政策，缅甸、锡兰也表示拒绝参加这个集团；同时，美国好战分子组织东北亚军事联盟的计划，在日本也没有引起它所预期的反应。这一切清楚地说明了，企图在亚洲推行敌视中国和制造新战争的政策是没有前途的。亚洲及世界各国人民要求和平的愿望是不可忽视的。
    中国人民经过了长期的艰苦奋斗，建立了我们伟大的国家。在短短五年之中，我们已经开始改变了自己国家的面貌，使许多习惯于看到旧中国的外来客人们感到惊奇，这是很自然的。但是，我们知道，我们的许多朋友们也一样地知道，我们的面前还有困难，我们还需要医好旧中国所遗留下来的许多创伤。我们工作中还有许多缺点，还需要我们不断努力改正。对于作好这些工作，我们有完全的信心，我们也需要朋友们的指教。
    我们愿意英国工党代表团在中国访问期间，将看到他们所愿意看到的东西。我们会乐于帮助他们满足他们的愿望。这将增加英国工党人士及英国广泛的各界人士对中国的了解，因而对于增进中英友好关系将发生重要的作用，这对于亚洲及世界的和平事业也是有重大裨益的。
