Inter-factory competition in Shenyang's state-owned machinery factories has been widely launched. A total of twenty-two factories are participating in the competition. The Third Machine Tool Factory, Wire Rod Factory, Transformer Factory, Air Compressor Factory, and others have all convened general meetings of employees and employee representative meetings to discuss the production tasks for the third quarter, formulate solutions to various problems, and launch competitions within the factories between workshops, groups, and departments, combining the internal factory competitions with the inter-factory competitions.

In the inter-factory competition, Soviet advanced experience has been further promoted. Since the radiator fin group of the cold working workshop of the Transformer Factory successfully learned the Soviet short-arc welding method, it has recently held training courses to comprehensively promote this advanced experience. The Third Machine Tool Factory learned from the Soviet experiences of "bedside inspection" and "intermediate process inspection of castings," which played a significant role in improving quality and reducing defective products. The scope of workers in the mechanical assembly workshop of the Pneumatic Tool Factory applying the "Chikilev tool method" and the "Shilov high-speed drilling method" has also been further expanded. The inter-factory competition has also promoted the development of the technical innovation movement. According to statistics from eight factories, including the Pneumatic Tool Factory, a total of 342 rationalization proposals were put forward in July, of which 194 have been implemented. Li Yuze, a worker at the Wire Rod Factory, and technical personnel jointly researched and successfully developed a double-tube discharge enclosing disk, which is preliminarily estimated to create more than 3 billion yuan of wealth for the country annually. Ai Chunlun and other workers at the Transformer Factory created a pumping tool tire, which solved an important technical key in the trial production of explosion-proof transformers. In the competition, most factories established group production meetings, ensuring the sustained development of the competition.

The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the First National Machinery Trade Union of China, which is responsible for organizing this competition, dispatched nine inspection teams in the middle of this month to inspect the competition in eighteen factories. Through inspection, the development of the competition will be further promoted in order to complete the national production plan for the third quarter.

    沈阳国营机械工厂厂际竞赛广泛展开
    沈阳市国营机械工厂的厂际竞赛已经广泛展开。参加竞赛的共有二十二个工厂。第三机床厂、线材厂、变压器厂、空气压缩机厂等都曾召开全体职工大会和职工代表会议，讨论了第三季度的生产任务，制订了解决各项问题的方案，在厂内开展了车间与车间、小组与小组、科室与科室的竞赛，使厂内的竞赛和厂际竞赛结合起来。
    在厂际竞赛中苏联先进经验得到进一步的推广。变压器厂冷作车间自从散热片小组学习苏联短弧焊接法成功后，最近已举办训练班全面推广这一先进经验。第三机床厂学习了苏联“床边检查”和
  “铸件中间工序检查”的经验，对提高质量减少废品起了很大作用。风动工具厂机械装配车间工人运用“奇基列夫车刀法”和“希洛夫高速钻孔法”的范围也进一步扩大了。厂际竞赛也推动了技术革新运动的发展，七月份根据风动工具厂等八个工厂的统计，共出现合理化建议三百四十二件，已实现一百九十四件。线材厂工人李雨泽和技术人员共同研究双管出料围盘成功，初步统计一年可多为国家创造三十亿元以上的财富。变压器厂工人艾春伦等创造打泵工具胎，解决了试制防爆变压器上的一项重要技术关键。在竞赛中，大部分工厂建立了小组生产会议，使得竞赛的持久开展获得了保证。
    负责组织这一竞赛的中国第一机械工会沈阳市委员会，在本月中旬已派出九个检查小组检查十八个工厂的竞赛情况。通过检查，将进一步推动竞赛的发展，以完成第三季度国家生产计划。
