Xinhua News Agency, August 6th: The Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, Zhang Hanfu, replied on the 4th to the British Chargé d'affaires ad interim, Mr. Tuvilliam, and sternly rejected the document submitted by the U.S. government regarding the accidental incident of the British aircraft. The U.S. government's presentation of this document is another unreasonable act of entanglement after it made a preposterous "protest" to our country, inverting black and white and attempting to confuse the public, after U.S. aircraft invaded our airspace and shot down our aircraft.

Since the United States used the accidental incident of the British aircraft to dispatch U.S. military aircraft to invade our country's airspace and shoot down two of our country's aircraft, our government has lodged the most serious protest against the United States' frantic provocations, and world public opinion has also widely expressed condemnation. This deliberately manufactured provocation completely exposed the U.S. authorities' conspiracy to expand aggression against China and deepen the tense situation in the Far East, and suffered a serious moral defeat. After the U.S. authorities' miscalculation of their conspiracy, they dared not respond to our country's solemn protest and the accusations of various countries' public opinion. At the same time, they attempted to make unreasonable disturbances using the British aircraft incident, which is being resolved by the Chinese and British governments through diplomatic channels, in order to shirk the responsibility they must bear for the aggressive atrocities over Hainan Island in our country.

The accidental incident of the British aircraft and the subsequent U.S. provocative actions have made world public opinion notice the serious situation caused by the U.S.'s policy of colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan and stepping up aggression and provocations against China. In a commentary on the recent aircraft incident, the British Labour Party's "Tribune" weekly said: "Support for Chiang Kai-shek is always a provocative act against the Chinese on the mainland. This makes dangerous incidents almost inevitable." The "Manchester Guardian" pointed out that if the Chiang Kai-shek clique is instigated to attack the mainland, and if the United States always wants to provoke China, the tense situation in Southeast Asia cannot be eased.

The U.S. authorities underestimated the judgmental ability of the public of various countries who are not swayed by prejudice. Its attempt to divert attention from the British aircraft incident by creating extraneous issues and unreasonable entanglement can only further expose its criminal prototype as an aggressor in front of the people.

### 美国就英机事件所作的无理纠缠  进一步暴露了它的侵略面目

    美国就英机事件所作的无理纠缠
    进一步暴露了它的侵略面目
    【新华社六日讯】我国外交部副部长章汉夫四日复函英国代办杜维廉，严正地拒绝了由他转来的美国政府所提出的关于英国飞机的意外事件的文件。美国政府提出这一文件是它在美机侵入我领空击落我机以后反而向我提出颠倒黑白、蒙混视听的荒谬“抗议”以后所采取的又一次无理纠缠的行动。
    自从美国利用英机意外事件派遣美国军用飞机侵犯我国领空击落我国飞机两架以后，我国政府对于美国的疯狂挑衅提出了最严重的抗议，全世界舆论也广泛表示谴责。这一蓄意制造的挑衅事件，使美国当局阴谋扩大侵略中国、加深远东紧张局势的面目完全暴露，在道义上遭到了严重的失败。美国当局在它的阴谋失算以后，一面对我国的严正抗议和各国舆论的指责不敢作答，一面企图利用正由中英两国政府经由外交途径加以解决的英机事件来无理取闹，以便推卸它对于我国海南岛上空的侵略暴行所必须承担的责任。
    英机意外事件以及随之而来的美国挑衅行动，已使世界各国舆论注意到美国勾结台湾蒋匪、加紧对中国进行侵略和挑衅的政策所造成的严重局面。在关于最近的飞机事件的评论中，英国工党“论坛”周刊说：“对蒋介石的支持永远是对大陆上的中国人的挑衅行为。这使得危险事件几乎不可避免。”“曼彻斯特卫报”指出，如果蒋介石集团受到唆使要袭击大陆的话，如果美国随时想向中国挑衅的话，东南亚紧张局势是不可能缓和的。
    美国当局低估了不为偏见所左右的各国公众的判断能力。它企图在英机事件上用节外生枝、毫无道理的纠缠来转移视线的做法，只能在人们的面前进一步暴露出它的侵略者的罪恶原形。
