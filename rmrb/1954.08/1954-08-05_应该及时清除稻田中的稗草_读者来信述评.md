    Banyard in Paddy Fields Should Be Removed Promptly
    ——Commentary on Readers' Letters
    Li Junkai
    Recently we have received some readers' letters reflecting that there is too much banyard in the rice, requesting farmers to pay attention to finding ways to remove the banyard in the paddy fields. Li Benlan from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army wrote in a letter: "Because there is a lot of banyard in the rice, comrades have to pick it out one by one with chopsticks when eating, and often even the attached rice is picked off, which wastes food and wastes time." Li Keqin, a worker from Changsha City, Hunan Province, wrote in a letter: "In the processing of rice, large grains of banyard are difficult to remove cleanly with sieves and windmills. Although the workers have put in a lot of effort, rework often occurs. Too much banyard in the rice not only increases processing costs, but also reduces the rice yield." Lin Junhe from the Grain Bureau of Daishan County, Zhejiang Province, wrote in a letter: "In addition to banyard, other debris in the grain can be removed without much effort based on the existing equipment conditions. Only banyard is the most difficult to clean. I think it is best to find ways to remove the banyard in the paddy fields." Some other readers' letters say that if you often eat rice mixed with banyard, you will suffer from gastrointestinal diseases and affect your health.
    The above opinions all show that if the rice is mixed with banyard, it is detrimental to both the rice processing department and the general consumers. Moreover, if there is too much banyard in the paddy fields, it will encroach on the fertilizer of the rice seedlings, the growth of the rice will be affected, the yield will be reduced, and the income of the farmers and the country's grain production increase plan will also be affected. Therefore, actively finding ways to remove banyard is indeed a problem worthy of attention.
    Banyard is a relatively stubborn weed in paddy fields. It has a particularly strong adaptability. When it coexists with rice, it is extremely unfavorable to the growth of rice because it absorbs a lot of fertilizer and grows quickly. In the past, although some farmers in some areas paid attention to banyard removal, most of them only pulled out the banyard ears after the rice was heading and before the harvest. This practice can only reduce the banyard in the rice that year, but it cannot be eradicated. Because the banyard is almost mature before it is pulled out, its seeds fall into the field, and banyard will still grow the following year.
    To remove banyard, it is necessary to carry out a series of removals throughout the rice growing process, grasping the links of seed selection, deep plowing, seedling fields, and field management, the earlier the better.
    At present, mid-season rice has already headed, and late-season rice is in the period of mid-cultivation and application of topdressing fertilizer. It is hoped that rural work comrades in various places will quickly seize the time to lead farmers to carry out field banyard removal. In the mid-season rice fields, the banyard should be pulled out before it is old and mature, and dried and burned; in the late-season rice fields, the banyard should be stepped into the field in combination with mid-cultivation. Of course, it will take a little more work to remove banyard in terms of cultivation. But at this time, if the farmers spend a little more effort, they can improve the yield and quality of rice, save a lot of manpower and material resources for rice processing plants, prevent the people of the whole country from affecting their health by eating banyard, and increase the income of the farmers themselves. This is really a good thing for the country, the people, and themselves. I hope that the peasant masses will take action quickly and remove the banyard.

    应该及时清除稻田中的稗草
    ——读者来信述评
    李君凯
    最近我们收到一些读者来信，反映稻谷里面稗子太多，要求农民注意在水稻田里就设法把稗子清除。中国人民解放军某部李本兰来信说：“由于大米里稗子多，同志们吃饭时要用筷子一颗一颗拣出来，常常连黏附着的米饭也拣掉了，既糟蹋了粮食，又浪费了时间。”湖南长沙市工人李克勤来信说：“在稻谷加工中，大粒的稗子，溜筛风车都很难除干净，工人们虽然费了很大的力气，还时常发生返工现象。稻谷里的稗子太多，不但增加了加工费用，而且降低了出米率。”浙江岱山县粮食局林钧和来信说：“在粮食中除了稗子以外，其他杂物，根据现有的设备条件，用不着费多大力量就可清除，只有稗子最难弄干净。我认为最好是在稻田里就设法把稗子清除掉。”还有一些读者来信说：如果经常吃夹有稗子的米饭，就会害肠胃病，影响身体的健康。
    以上这些意见都说明如果稻谷中夹杂着稗子，对稻谷加工部门和广大消费者都是不利的。而且稻田中稗子多了，侵夺了禾苗的肥料，水稻的生长就会受到影响，产量将因此降低，农民的收入和国家的粮食增产计划也将受到影响。因此，积极设法清除稗子确是一个值得重视的问题。
    稗草是水稻田中比较顽强的一种杂草，它的适应性特别强，在与水稻并存的情况下，由于它吸肥多，生长快，对水稻的生长极端不利。过去，虽然也有部分地区的农民重视了除稗工作，但是多半在水稻抽穗后快要收割前才拔除稗穗子。这种做法只能使当年稻谷中的稗子减少一些，还是不能根除。因为稗子快成熟了才拔除，它的籽粒掉在田中，第二年还是会生长出稗子来。
    要清除稗子，必须在整个水稻生长过程中，抓住选种、深耕、秧田和田间管理等环节，进行一系列的清除，除得愈早愈好。
    目前中稻已经抽穗，晚稻正是中耕施追肥的时期，希望各地农村工作同志赶快抓紧时间领导农民进行田间除稗。在中稻田里，要趁稗子还未老熟的时候拔除，并晒干烧毁；在晚稻田里则应结合中耕，把稗草踏入田中。清除稗草，当然在耕作上是要多费一点工的。但这个时候农民多费一点工，就能提高水稻的产量和质量，就可以使加工米厂节省很多人力物力，使全国人民不因吃了稗子而影响健康，农民自己的收入也可增加。这实在是对国家、对人民、对自己都有好处的事情，希望农民群众赶快行动起来，把稗草清除掉。
