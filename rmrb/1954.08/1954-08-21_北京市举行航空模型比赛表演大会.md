Beijing Holds Aeromodelling Competition and Performance Event

The 1954 Beijing Third Aeromodelling Competition and Performance Event was held on August 15th at the Temple of Heaven National Defense Sports Field. Over 240 athletes and more than 330 model airplanes of various types from 25 units, including Beijing No. 25 Middle School, Beijing No. 35 Middle School, Beijing Aviation Institute, Beijing Normal University, the Affiliated Middle School of Beijing Normal University, and the “Young Aeromodellers Group” of the Beijing Children's Palace, participated in the performance. The audience numbered over 16,000 people.

When the athletes entered the venue holding their own designed or manufactured model airplanes, the audience responded with enthusiastic applause. The performance began when a 2-meter diameter hot air balloon with the slogan "Ready: Strive to dedicate ourselves to the motherland's aviation industry," from the "Young Aeromodellers Group" of the Children's Palace slowly rose. The performance included several items such as large-scale tethered model airplanes, rubber band powered model airplanes, line-controlled and free-flight piston engine model airplanes, as well as aerobatic and speed model airplanes. A large free-flight piston engine model airplane designed by members of the aeromodelling group of the Affiliated Middle School of Beijing Normal University circled and rose smoothly in the air along with the eagles in the sky. A large free-flight piston engine model airplane, performed by cadres of the Central National Defense Sports Club's Aeromodelling Sports Working Group, dropped a batch of small parachutes of various colors in the air like a real airplane and finally rose to a height of 1,000 meters. This small plane flew for more than 30 minutes. The audience was very interested in the line-controlled aerobatic model airplane performance by Mei Jinghua, a member of the Aeromodelling Research Association of the Beijing Aviation Institute. The airplane sometimes flew upside down in the sky, and suddenly dived down rapidly from the sky, almost touching the ground, and in the blink of an eye flew up again. Then, after somersaulting several times in a row, it landed safely. (Attached picture)

    北京市举行航空模型比赛表演大会
    一九五四年北京市第三届航空模型比赛、表演大会八月十五日在天坛国防体育运动场举行。参加表演的有北京市第二十五中学、北京市第三十五中学、北京航空学院、北京师范大学、北京师范大学附属中学、北京市少年之家“少年航空模型家小组”等二十五个单位的二百四十多个运动员，三百三十多架各式各样的模型飞机。观众达一万六千多人。
    当运动员们手拿着他们自己设计或制造的模型飞机进入会场时，观众报以热烈的鼓掌。在少年之家“少年航空模型家小组”的带有“准备着：为献身祖国航空事业而奋斗”标语的二公尺直径热空气气球冉冉上升时，表演就开始了。共有大型牵引模型飞机、橡筋动力模型飞机、线操纵和自由飞活塞式发动机模型飞机以及特技、竞速模型飞机等若干表演项目。北京师范大学附属中学航空模型组组员所设计的大型自由飞活塞式发动机模型飞机，平稳地在半空与天上的飞鹰在一起盘旋、上升。中央国防体育俱乐部航空模型运动工作组的干部表演的大型自由飞活塞式发动机模型飞机，在空中像真飞机一样，放下一批各种颜色的小降落伞，最后一直升到一千公尺的高空。这架小飞机共飞了三十多分钟。观众们对北京航空学院航空模型研究会会员梅菁华的线操纵特技模型飞机的表演很感兴趣。飞机有时在天空倒飞，忽然又从天空迅速地俯冲下来，几乎要碰到地面了，转眼间又飞上去，接着，连翻了几个筋斗之后，安然地着陆了。（附图片）
