Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: Under the instigation of the United States, the Thai ruling clique is stepping up the fabrication of slanderous propaganda against the People's Republic of China. According to a "New York Times" dispatch on the 12th, Thai Foreign Minister Prince Wan Waithayakon, in a recent speech, insisted that the Dai ethnic autonomous region in Yunnan Province, China, is a "Free Thai Movement," and further fabricated the absurd rumor that the "headquarters of the Free Thai Movement" has moved to northeastern Burma. At a time when the peaceful foreign policy of the People's Republic of China, especially the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, has had a widespread impact in Asia and the world and is hindering the US plot to assemble a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, it is no accident that the Thai Foreign Minister has made such slanderous remarks that the US has repeatedly spread. The US aggressive bloc clearly wants to use the Thai ruling clique's slander of Chinese "aggression" to maintain an atmosphere of tension. At the same time, as the Thai authorities' implementation of the US policy of arms expansion and war preparation is being met with increasingly widespread opposition from the domestic population, the US and Thai ruling cliques also want to use fabrication to deceive the people and divert their attention.

The specific activities of the Thai pro-American reactionary clique write a footnote to its absurd remarks. At the same time that Prince Wan Waithayakon was spreading rumors in New York, Bangkok decided to send a "Thai Military Goodwill Delegation" to Taiwan and Burma. Nai Phao, the head of the Thai pro-American clique and Director-General of the Police, will also visit Taiwan before the end of August. Foreign news agencies point out that these conspiracies were arranged by the US special agent chief, US Ambassador to Thailand, Donovan. Putting these two things together, it is clear that the Thai ruling clique is, under US instigation, trying to alienate the friendly relations between China and Burma.

The absurd remarks of Prince Wan Waithayakon and the US ruling clique cannot stand up to the facts. As everyone knows, since the founding of the People's Republic of China, domestic ethnic relations have undergone fundamental changes, and a policy of ethnic equality has been implemented. In order to enable minority nationalities to fully enjoy political rights, the Central People's Government has gradually established ethnic autonomous regions in various minority nationality areas throughout the country, and helped various minority nationalities establish autonomous local governments. The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province is one of many autonomous regions. There is also the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, which is jointly formed by the Dai and another minority nationality. The establishment of these autonomous regions is a manifestation of the Central People's Government's ethnic policy. The minority brothers in these autonomous regions are enjoying a free and happy life, and their economies are developing day by day. Any attempt to slander this internal affair of China's ethnic autonomy will only further expose their despicable faces.

### 泰国亲美集团捏造谎言进行诬蔑性宣传  目的在于维持紧张空气并转移泰国民众的视线

    泰国亲美集团捏造谎言进行诬蔑性宣传
    目的在于维持紧张空气并转移泰国民众的视线
    【新华社十八日讯】在美国指使之下，泰国统治集团正在加紧制造诬蔑中华人民共和国的煽动性宣传。据“纽约时报”十二日消息，泰国外交部长旺亲王在他最近发表的一次谈话中，硬说我国云南省傣族同胞的自治区是一个“自由泰国运动”，并进一步制造“自由泰国运动的总部”已经搬到缅甸东北部这一无稽谰言。当中华人民共和国的和平外交政策，特别是和平共处的五项原则在亚洲和世界引起广泛的影响并阻碍着美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团的阴谋实现的时候，泰国的外交部长发表这类美国方面曾经一再散布过的诬蔑言论，绝不是偶然的。美国侵略集团显然是想利用泰国统治集团诬蔑中国“侵略”来维持紧张空气。同时，在泰国当局执行美国扩军备战政策中遭到国内民众越来越广泛反对的时候，美国和泰国的统治集团也想用捏造来欺骗民众，转移他们的视线。
    泰国亲美反动集团的具体活动为它的谰言写下了注脚。和旺亲王在纽约散布谣言的同时，曼谷方面已决定要派一个“泰国军事亲善代表团”到台湾和缅甸。泰国亲美集团首脑分子、警察总监乃炮也将于八月底以前访问台湾。外国通讯社指出，这些阴谋活动是美国特务头子、美国驻泰国大使杜诺万布置的。把两件事情结合起来看，就明显地暴露出来：泰国统治集团正在美国指使下，力图离间中缅两国的友好关系。
    旺亲王和美国统治集团的谰言，在事实面前是无法立足的。大家知道，中华人民共和国自从成立以来，国内民族关系有了根本的改变，贯彻执行着民族平等的政策。为了使少数民族充分享受政治权利，我中央人民政府在全国各地不同的少数民族聚居地区逐渐建立了民族自治区，帮助各少数民族建立了自治的地方政府。云南省西双版纳傣族自治区就是许多自治区中的一个。云南省还有傣族和另一个少数民族联合组成的德宏傣族景颇族自治区。这些自治区的建立是中央人民政府民族政策的体现，在这些自治区的少数民族兄弟正享受着自由幸福的生活，它们的经济日益发展。任何诬蔑把我国民族自治这一内政措施的企图，都只会更加暴露他们的卑鄙面目。
