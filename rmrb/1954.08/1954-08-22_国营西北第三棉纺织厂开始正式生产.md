The newly built state-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory began accepting state-assigned production tasks in August, transitioning from trial production to formal production.

The state-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory is a modern factory. Construction began in August of last year, and the main factory building was completed in February of this year. Machine installation followed, and the factory gradually transitioned to trial production in mid-April. The two-plus months of trial runs have improved the technical skills of the operating workers and allowed for a review and correction of machine quality. Since formally transitioning to production in August, the product quality has been excellent. According to inspections in early August: the quality of the yarn all reached first-class grade one; superior-quality cloth accounted for about 70 percent, and the rate of substandard cloth dropped to 4.26 percent. The Lishan brand white cloth produced by the factory has already been put on the market, and after formal production begins, it will be supplied in large quantities to meet the needs of the people.

On August 7th, the factory director announced the good news to all employees that they had formally accepted the state's production tasks, and the employees all felt very honored. During group discussions, the workers expressed their determination to continue improving their skills and working hard to ensure the completion of the first month's production tasks assigned by the state.

    国营西北第三棉纺织厂开始正式生产
    新建的国营西北第三棉纺织厂，从八月份开始接受国家交给的生产任务，由试车生产转入正式生产。
    国营西北第三棉纺织厂是一座现代化工厂。由去年八月开始动工兴建，今年二月主厂房落成，接着安装机器，四月中开始逐步转入试车生产。两个多月以来的试车，提高了运转工人的技术水平，并对机器质量作了复查与校正。八月份正式转入生产以来，产品质量优良。据八月上旬的检验：纱的质量全部达到一等一级；上等布占百分之七十左右，次布率下降到百分之四点二六。该厂生产的骊山牌白布已经上市，正式生产后将大量供应人民的需要。
    八月七日，该厂厂长向全体职工宣布他们正式接受国家生产任务的喜讯，职工都感到很光荣。在小组讨论会上，工人纷纷表示要继续提高技术，努力工作，保证完成国家交给的第一个月的生产任务。
