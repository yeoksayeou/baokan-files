A talk by Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society

    I represent the Jiusan Society in wholeheartedly supporting Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. Our delegation, headed by Premier Zhou, made a great contribution to easing international tensions and maintaining Asian and world peace at the Geneva Conference. We express our heartfelt gratitude and cordial greetings. The achievements of the Geneva Conference have irrefutably proven that: the increasingly powerful world peace force is irresistible; the peaceful diplomatic policy of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is in line with the interests of the people of the world; the policy of maintaining and creating international tensions and carrying out new military adventures by the US aggressor clique has once again failed, and the dark era of imperialism bullying and enslaving other nations will be forever declared over.
    The Chinese people warmly welcome the various agreements reached at the Geneva Conference on the cessation of hostilities and restoration of peace in Indochina, and are willing to work with the countries concerned and peace-loving people around the world to ensure the thorough implementation of these agreements. Although a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue has not been reached due to the unreasonable sabotage by the US government and its puppet Syngman Rhee clique, this issue has not been removed from the agenda, and the people of the world must continue to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. The Chinese people fully agree with and support the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence put forward in the joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma. We believe that, according to these Five Principles, countries with different political and social systems can coexist peacefully, and Asian and world peace can be gradually consolidated.
    At a time when the vast majority of countries in the world are calling for peaceful coexistence, and the vast majority of people around the world are opposed to war and yearning for peace, the US aggressor clique is stubbornly pursuing a policy of strength through arms expansion and war preparations, and carrying out a series of conspiracies in Asia and Europe. In order to create new tensions, the US aggressor clique has recently intensified its use of the Chiang Kai-shek remnants entrenched in Taiwan to carry out harassing and destructive warfare against our mainland and coastal areas, massacring our compatriots, plundering coastal fishermen and merchant ships of other countries, and dispatching and airdropping special agents to our mainland to carry out assassination work. The US aggressor clique is also negotiating with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to conclude a so-called "bilateral common security treaty," and colluding with Japanese reactionary forces and puppets such as Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek to form a so-called "Northeast Asia Defense Alliance,"妄想“using Asians to fight Asians.” All of this not only violates the solemn provisions of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation signed by the United States, infringes upon the integrity of our country's territory and sovereignty, and threatens our country's security, but also seriously undermines peace in Asia and the world.
    We solemnly declare to the world: Taiwan is originally our country's territory, and we will never allow the United States to occupy it, nor will we allow it to be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations. Liberating Taiwan is China's sovereignty and internal affair, and no other country is allowed to interfere. The standing-up and powerful Chinese people have destroyed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang armed to the teeth by US imperialism, driven the US aggressive forces out of the Chinese mainland, and today have absolute confidence and strength to wipe out all the Chiang bandits completely and thoroughly. We must liberate Taiwan and let our Taiwan compatriots return to the free and happy embrace of the motherland. This is part of the sacred liberation cause of the Chinese people, and we must thoroughly complete this solemn historical task and never stop until we achieve our goal.
    In the face of this great historical task, all the Chinese people must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strengthen our work in all aspects, and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, and finally complete the sacred liberation cause of the Chinese people.

    A talk by Xie Xuehong, Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League

    The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League warmly supports Premier Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report. With incomparable excitement and gratitude, we respond to the call of our Central People's Government to liberate Taiwan. We believe that the people of Taiwan will be overjoyed and spread the word when they hear Premier Zhou's report. The call of the motherland gives them tremendous strength. They must unite and dig a grave for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group.
    The people of Taiwan are all Chinese people. Most of them are from southern Fujian, some are Hakka, and a small number are Gaoshan compatriots. No oppression can change the blood flowing in their bodies, and no force can extinguish their natural affection for the motherland. The people of Taiwan also have the qualities of diligence and bravery of the people on the mainland. For generations, they have irrigated the land of Taiwan with sweat and resisted foreign aggression and domestic reactionary rule with blood.
    The Manchu Qing government sold Taiwan to Japan. The people of Taiwan fought alone for six months, launched more than a dozen armed uprisings, and continued their anti-Japanese movement until Japan surrendered. The people of Taiwan will not be slaves of Japan, nor will they ever be slaves of the United States. The name of Zheng Chenggong shines with the glory of the Chinese nation in Taiwan, and the people of Taiwan will not allow Chiang Kai-shek to sell Taiwan to the United States. The Earth belongs to the solar system, and Taiwan belongs to China. Today, Taiwan has a powerful motherland, the People's Republic of China. The people of Taiwan are not orphans, they have 600 million brothers and sisters on the mainland of the motherland. We will never allow Taiwan to become a colony of the United States, nor will we tolerate the absurd idea of ​​placing Taiwan under the trusteeship of the United Nations.
    Taiwan's history is written with chapters of the people resisting domestic tyranny. The people of Taiwan once resisted the feudal rule of the Manchu Qing with "a small rebellion every three years and a big rebellion every five years." After Chiang Kai-shek "took over" Taiwan, the people of Taiwan hated the heinous rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and in February 1947, there was a heroic armed struggle like a storm. Although the struggle was suppressed by the reactionaries, the people of Taiwan did not succumb, and their hatred for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group grew deeper and deeper. Under the cruel oppression and exploitation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, the people of Taiwan are losing rice, losing sugar, losing jobs, losing houses, losing children, losing freedom and survival; they are suffering from whipping and destruction. The people of Taiwan are looking forward day and night to the liberation army of the motherland crossing the Taiwan Strait. They are sharpening their fists and waiting for the opportunity to fight against the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group.
    The people of Taiwan, together with the people of the motherland, vow to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, finally complete the reunification of the motherland, and fight to the end to defend peace in Asia and the world.

    A talk by Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Democratic Federation

    Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee detailed the contributions made by the delegation of the People's Republic of China at the Geneva Conference to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the Indochina armistice issue, as well as the brilliant achievements of the Geneva Conference, and pointed out the diplomatic tasks that the people of the country must continue to work hard on at present. This report gave the people of the country great excitement. Women across the country are honored by the role played and the achievements made by our delegation at the Geneva Conference, and vow to take the tasks put forward in the report as their sacred duty and fight to the end to realize this sacred duty.
    Taiwan has always been an integral part of our sacred territory, so liberating Taiwan is our sacred and inviolable responsibility. Whoever occupies Taiwan is infringing upon our country's territorial sovereignty and is determined to be an enemy of the 600 million people of China. We firmly oppose the US aggressor clique supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang to occupy Taiwan as a military base for attacking our mainland; we firmly oppose the absurd proposition of placing Taiwan under the trusteeship of the United Nations, and we firmly oppose the US imperialists forcibly stuffing the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group into the United Nations to act as "Chinese representatives." Taiwan must be liberated, and we have enough strength and confidence to recover Taiwan.
    Our women across the country must continue to exert their strength in various positions under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, and fight to the end to complete the tasks of liberating Taiwan and defending peace in Asia and the world.

    拥护周总理兼外长的外交报告
    九三学社中央委员会主席许德珩的谈话
    我代表九三学社衷心拥护和支持周恩来总理兼外长在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上的外交报告。这次以周总理为首的我国代表团在日内瓦会议上对于缓和国际紧张局势、维护亚洲和世界和平作出了巨大的贡献，我们表示衷心的感谢和亲切的慰问。日内瓦会议的成就无可辩驳地证明了：日益强大的世界和平力量是不可抗拒的；以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的和平外交政策是符合于全世界人民的利益的；美国侵略集团保持和制造国际紧张局势、进行新的军事冒险的政策是又一次遭到了失败，帝国主义欺侮和奴役其他民族的黑暗时代将永远宣告结束了。
    中国人民热烈欢迎日内瓦会议关于印度支那停战和恢复和平问题的各项协议，并愿与有关国家和全世界爱好和平的人民为保证这些协议的彻底实施而共同努力。和平解决朝鲜问题虽然由于美国政府和它的傀儡李承晚集团横蛮无理的破坏而没有达成协议，但这个问题并没有从议程上抹掉，全世界人民还要继续谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。中国人民完全赞同和拥护中印两国总理及中缅两国总理在联合声明中所提出的互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，我们认为，根据这五项原则，不同的政治和社会制度的国家是可以和平共处的，亚洲及世界和平是可以逐步得到巩固的。
    在全世界绝大多数国家要求和平共处，全世界广大人民反对战争、渴望和平的时候，美国侵略集团却一意孤行地坚持扩军备战的实力政策，在亚洲和欧洲进行一系列的阴谋活动。美国侵略集团为了制造新的紧张局势，最近更加加紧利用亡命在台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮对我国大陆和沿海进行骚扰性的和破坏性的战争，屠杀我国同胞，劫掠沿海渔民和其他国家的商船，派遣和空投特务到我国大陆进行暗害工作。美国侵略集团并和蒋介石卖国贼谈判订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”，和日本反动势力及李承晚、蒋介石等傀儡拼凑所谓“东北亚防御联盟”，妄想“利用亚洲人打亚洲人”。所有这一切，不但违反了美国参加签署的开罗宣言和波茨坦公告的庄严规定，侵犯了我国领土和主权的完整，威胁了我国的安全，而且严重地破坏了亚洲和世界的和平。
    我们要郑重地向全世界宣告：台湾本来就是我国的领土，决不容许美国侵占，也决不容许交给联合国托管。解放台湾是中国的主权和内政，决不容许其他国家来干涉。站起来了的、强大的中国人民曾经摧毁了被美帝国主义武装到牙齿的蒋介石匪帮，把美国侵略势力从中国大陆上赶出去，今天有绝对的信心和力量把一小撮蒋匪全部地、彻底地消灭干净。我们一定要解放台湾，让台湾同胞回到祖国自由幸福的怀抱里来。这是中国人民的神圣解放事业的一部分，我们一定要彻底完成这个庄严的历史任务，不达目的，决不休止。
    全中国人民在这一伟大的历史任务面前，要更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，从各方面加强工作，为解放台湾，消灭蒋介石残余匪帮，以最后完成我中国人民的神圣解放事业而斗争到底。

    台湾民主自治同盟主席谢雪红的谈话
    台湾民主自治同盟热烈拥护周恩来总理的外交报告。以无比的兴奋和感激，响应我中央人民政府解放台湾的号召。我们相信，台湾人民听到了周总理的报告，必将大喜若狂，奔走相告。祖国的呼唤，给他们巨大的力量。他们一定要团结起来，为蒋介石卖国集团掘好坟墓。
    台湾人民都是中国人民。——大部分是闽南人，一部分客家人，少数高山族同胞。任何压迫不能改变他们身上所流的血液，任何力量不能消灭他们热爱祖国的天然感情。台湾人民同样有大陆人民勤劳和勇敢的特质。他们世代相传，以汗珠灌溉台湾的土地，以鲜血反抗外国的侵略和本国的反动统治。
    满清政府出卖台湾给日本。台湾人民孤军抗战六个月，武装起义十余次，前仆后继的反日运动一直进行到日本投降为止。台湾人民不做日本的奴隶，也绝不做美国的奴隶。郑成功的名字在台湾闪耀着中国民族的光辉，台湾人民不让蒋介石把台湾出卖给美国。地球属于太阳系，台湾属于中国。今天台湾已有强大的祖国中华人民共和国，台湾人民不是孤儿，他们有着祖国大陆上六万万的兄弟姊妹。我们绝不容许台湾成为美国的殖民地，也绝不容忍那种所谓将台湾交联合国托管的荒谬主张。
    台湾历史写着人民反抗国内暴政的诗章。台湾人民曾以“三年一小叛、五年一大叛”反抗满清的封建统治。在蒋介石“劫收”了台湾之后，台湾人民憎恨国民党反动派的万恶统治，一九四七年二月，就爆发过一次暴风雨的英勇的武装斗争。斗争虽然被反动派镇压下来，但是台湾人民并没有屈服，对蒋介石卖国集团的仇恨日益深刻增长。在蒋介石卖国集团残酷的压迫和剥削下，台湾人民正在失去米谷，失去食糖，失去职业，失去房屋，失去子弟，失去自由和生存；他们正在遭受着鞭挞和毁灭。台湾人民日夜盼望着祖国解放大军渡过台湾海峡，他们在磨拳擦掌，在等待时机，准备对蒋介石卖国集团厮杀。
    台湾人民和祖国人民一道，誓为解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，最后完成祖国的统一，为保卫亚洲及世界的和平而战斗到底。

    中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅的谈话
    周恩来总理兼外交部长在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上的外交报告，详尽地阐述了我中华人民共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上为和平解决朝鲜问题以及印度支那停战问题所作的贡献和日内瓦会议的辉煌成就，并指出了当前全国人民必须继续努力的外交任务。这个报告给予了全国人民以莫大的兴奋。全国妇女均以我国代表团在日内瓦会议中所起的作用和所作出的成就而感到荣幸，并誓以报告中所提出的任务作为自己的神圣职责，为实现这个神圣的职责而奋斗到底。
    台湾从来就是我国神圣的领土的一部分，因此解放台湾是我们的神圣不可侵犯的责任。谁侵占台湾就是侵犯我国领土主权，就是居心与中国六万万人民为敌。我们坚决反对美国侵略集团支持蒋介石卖国匪帮盘踞台湾作为进攻我大陆的军事基地；我们坚决反对把台湾交联合国托管的荒谬主张，我们坚决反对美帝国主义把蒋介石卖国集团的代表硬塞到联合国充当“中国代表”。台湾一定是要解放的，我们有足够的力量和信心收复台湾。
    我们全国妇女，必须在中央人民政府和中国共产党领导下，在各种不同的岗位上继续发挥自己的力量，为完成解放台湾，保卫亚洲和世界和平的任务而奋斗到底。　（新华社）
