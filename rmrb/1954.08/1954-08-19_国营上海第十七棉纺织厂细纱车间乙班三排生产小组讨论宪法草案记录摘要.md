Excerpts from the Discussion of the Draft Constitution by the Third Platoon Production Team of the B Shift, Fine Spinning Workshop, State-Owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill
By Our Correspondents Yu Ming and Xi Ping
    On the afternoon of July 26th, the Third Platoon Production Team of the B Shift, Fine Spinning Workshop, Second Spinning Department, State-Owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill held a discussion meeting on the Draft Constitution. In addition to all 21 workers of the Third Platoon Production Team of the B Shift, veteran workers from the factory such as Shen Zhenglin, Ding Lingdi, Fan Hongzhu, Zhu Lianke, and Lu Guanlang also participated in this discussion meeting. The following is a portion of the meeting record.

    With the Leadership of the Working Class, the People Have Democratic Rights
    Shen Zhenglin: I am fifty-seven years old this year. I started working at the age of twenty-seven, which was in 1924. Thirty years ago, this factory was the Japanese Toyo Cotton Mill Co., Ltd. We all called it Yufeng Yarn Factory. At that time, I was a worker under the oppression and exploitation of imperialism. Today, thirty years later, I am sitting in our own factory, participating with everyone in formulating the fundamental law of the country. Thirty years have passed! Today, after reading Article 1 of the General Program of the Draft Constitution, "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants," many things about our workers striving for freedom and independence resurfaced in my mind. Thirty years ago, Chinese workers were oppressed everywhere in the factory. If three people talked together, the Japanese would stamp their feet. The monthly wages received by workers were not enough to buy two dou of rice. In February 1925, the workers went on a major strike. I remember that on the morning of the strike, the workers carried a large red flag and gathered at the Shenjiaqiao graveyard for a meeting. The slogans raised were: "Oppose the Japanese beating people, demand increased wages." Not only did Japanese imperialism not agree to our demands, but they also arrested our representatives. However, the workers were not intimidated. The next morning, the workers re-surrounded the police station, demanding the release of the representatives. Everyone angrily dismantled the fence of the police station. At this time, imperialism opened fire on our unarmed people, arresting more than twenty people on the spot. Now, when we hold meetings, you can express whatever opinions you want. If it is beneficial to the country, not only will your opinions be accepted, but you will also be encouraged. When you walk on the road, you can talk to whomever you want, and no one will tail you anymore. Our lives have been greatly improved! The various provisions of the Draft Constitution further consolidate our democratic rights and happy lives. The publication of the Draft Constitution is a great event for the people of the whole country, and especially a great event for our working class. I must take good care of my apprentices and teach them all my skills, so that young people can grow up quickly and strive to achieve the goal of building a socialist society.
    Lu Guanlang: I have been working for more than twenty years now. In these twenty years, apart from the five years since liberation, I have suffered all kinds of torment and have been arrested and imprisoned three times. Comrades may find it strange that someone like me, Lu Guanlang, is straightforward by nature, doesn't rob or steal, so why was I arrested and sued? I say, this is not strange at all. In the old society, the world belonged to the imperialists, bureaucratic capitalists, and landlords. They had armies and prisons. Anyone who didn't want to be oppressed by them would be arrested. That's the reason. In 1934, the Japanese killed Mei Shijun, a worker at the Dakang Yarn Factory (now State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 12). We opposed the imperialists killing Chinese people and held two demonstrations. Imperialism suppressed us with arrests and killings. At that time, the blood of the sacrificed comrades flowed all over the street. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, the Kuomintang took over the factory. They oppressed the workers as cruelly as the Japanese imperialists, and also developed various counter-revolutionary organizations in the factory. I refused to participate in counter-revolutionary organizations, and as a result, I was arrested. The Kuomintang bandits beat me, wanting me to confess who instructed me to do this. I didn't say anything. I thought to myself: "Many comrades shed their blood and sacrificed themselves for our liberation. The bright red flag is still flying in my heart. I would rather die than do anything that would let down my comrades!" After liberation, we enjoyed full democratic rights. This is all the result of the heroic struggle of the martyrs. This is all because our working class has seized power. The Draft Constitution writes down the leading role of the working class. We should continue to strive to strengthen the leadership of the working class with our own labor.

    Living Happily, Labor is Glorious
    Cao Xiaomei: Everyone who works at the No. 17 Factory will see how much our factory and our lives have changed since liberation. This change means that we are becoming happier and happier. The Draft Constitution stipulates that it guarantees the people a better life. Who wouldn't support that! The equipment in the factory is becoming more and more sophisticated. The factory buildings are equipped with cooling equipment, which is clean and comfortable. The factory has opened a large canteen, where workers can often eat fish, meat, and fresh vegetables. The factory has a cooperative, where the prices of goods are cheaper than in the market. We all participate in various study classes to continuously improve our political, technical, and cultural levels, making our lives more meaningful. We all go to and from work happily every day. The factory has a nursery that can accommodate more than 700 children. As soon as I enter the nursery, I feel that our children are really blessed! Taking my own family as an example, now my mother, my husband, and I all have fixed jobs. We have no difficulty with food and clothing. My eight-year-old child has already entered kindergarten. This is really a big event for our family. I had two miscarriages after liberation, and both times the factory sent me to the hospital in a car. The factory paid for all the medicine I spent in the hospital. The food I ate was already very good, but the doctor was still afraid that I wouldn't like it, and often asked me if I wanted to eat it. Now, if anyone wants to destroy our good life like this, wants to make our factory like it was before liberation, wants us to live a life where we put salt in water as a dish, wants our female workers to be insulted, kicked, and beaten in the workshop, that won't work. The people's constitution will protect us.
    Chen A'di: I am really happy that the state is letting us discuss the Draft Constitution. The Draft Constitution says: Citizens have the right to education. I think this is absolutely true. This year my eldest child has already been admitted to elementary school. In the past, could the children of us workers go to school? They would have gone to pick up coal cinders outside long ago! The Draft Constitution stipulates that workers can receive material assistance from the state when they are old, sick, or lose their ability to work. I say, this is absolutely true. For example, last year I got bronchitis, and the leadership sent me to a sanatorium for treatment. When I was about to get better, I insisted on coming back to work, but the sanatorium didn't allow it. If I had gotten such a disease in the past, I would have been fired long ago. I remember one year when there was a major strike in the factory. I closed three machines, and the Japanese grabbed me and kicked me around. Later, they even stopped my work. At that time, it was impossible to even guarantee a living, let alone anything else. However, I feel that now we should not separate enjoying rights and fulfilling obligations. Only by fulfilling our obligations better can we enjoy more rights. In the future, I will conscientiously abide by labor discipline and strive to complete the production plan.
    Kong Fenzhen: From the various rights that we workers have enjoyed since liberation, I have understood that it is really important for the working class to have leadership. The Draft Constitution stipulates that our country is led by the working class and that all power belongs to the people. I am really happy to hear this. It's true, if it weren't for our working class having leadership, how could we enjoy so many rights! We now have the right to work. If we work well, we can be respected. I myself was named an advanced producer in the factory because of my hard work in production. Everyone also chose me to go to Hangzhou for recuperation, and I was welcomed by people on the train. Our team leader, Huang Baomei, produces very well. Not only has she become a national model worker in the textile industry and a people's representative of Shanghai, participating in the management of state affairs, but she was also sent to the Soviet Union this year to visit. In the factory, our factory buildings are clean and tidy, with cooling equipment. Compared with the factory buildings before liberation, which were as hot as fire, what a difference! The state even regularly repairs the roads we walk on to and from work, making them smooth. But in the old society, we did the same work, but labor was looked down upon. When we took a lunch box to work, people would say we were beggars, and we would avoid people when walking on the road. I am thirty-two years old this year, and I just started going to school to study. The teachers are very enthusiastic in helping us. In the country led by our working class, I enjoy the right to education. Now, the Draft Constitution has written down all the rights we have obtained, and also stipulated that we must build a socialist goal. To build socialism, we must strengthen the leadership of the working class. I want to lead everyone to learn the Hao Jianxiu work method, improve production, consolidate our leadership, and ensure that we live a better life.

    Mothers and Children are Protected by the State
    Chen Liudi: The Draft Constitution stipulates that mothers and children should be protected by the state. I think that this article has already been implemented in the years since liberation. Both I and my children have been protected by the state. I often say that the lives of women and children now are truly like being in heaven. Yesterday, my nine-year-old child was admitted to school. Three months ago, I gave birth to my fifth child. I rested for more than fifty days before and after childbirth, and the factory still paid me my salary as usual. After I went to work, the child was placed in the factory nursery. The leaders allowed us to breastfeed the child during working hours. The nursery workers saw that my milk was not enough, so they added milk to the child twice a day. Every day after work, I go home with a clean and lovely child in my arms, and I am really happy from the bottom of my heart.
    The lives that children are living now, not only have I never lived, but even my eldest child never lived when he was young. After the eldest child was born, the Kuomintang reactionaries ran a nursery to put on a show. I sent the child there, but he lost weight in less than a month. Speaking of my childhood, it was even more bitter. My hometown was originally in Yangzhou. There were eight siblings. My father rented land from the landlord. After paying the rent, we had nothing to eat. When I was eight years old, my mother said to me: "Child! It's not that your mother is cruel, but you will be a child bride tomorrow. You will have to be more obedient there than at home!" My mother sent me away crying. When I was fourteen years old, I went to work in a factory. Thinking about the past and comparing it to the present, I feel even more that the Draft Constitution is really well-written, and it has written down the interests of us women and children.

    Strive to Build a Socialist Society
    Cao Xiuying: One article in the Draft Constitution says that the state protects our personal freedom from infringement. This made me think of my past. My hometown is in Sichuan. When I was a child, because my family rented land from the landlord, one year the harvest was bad and we couldn't pay the rent, so I was introduced to work at the Hechuan Yarn Factory. I worked twelve hours a day, ate poorly, and had nothing to wear. When I asked the factory for wages, the factory didn't give them to me. When I wanted to leave that factory, the capitalist of the factory brought the introducer and wouldn't let me go. Only then did I realize that I had been sold by the introducer, and he had already used the factory's money. Later, I and two other female workers secretly escaped from that factory together. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, my husband and I went to work in a factory in Shanghai from Chongqing. Our lives only slowly got better after liberation. I participated in various studies and meetings, and only then did I understand that labor is the most glorious thing, and it is everyone's right. But in the old society, either there was no way to participate in labor, or if you participated in labor, you lost your personal freedom. After liberation, no one dares to sell people anymore. The Draft Constitution stipulates that personal freedom is not violated, and there will be no more cases of selling people. I want to produce even better, build the country even better, so that our rights can be better protected.
    Huang Baomei: When I received the newspaper printed with the Draft Constitution, I was really happy. I felt that our working class's happy life will be even more guaranteed in the future. Just now, veteran workers such as Shen Zhenglin and Lu Guanlang talked about how bravely we workers struggled in the past. If it weren't for the martyrs shedding their blood and sacrificing themselves to achieve revolutionary victory, such a good Draft Constitution could not have been made. Every article in the Draft Constitution is condensed with the blood of the martyrs.
    Before liberation, we workers were looked down upon. Entering the factory was like entering a prison. I remember one year when I was crossing the river by ferry from Pudong, a gust of wind blew and unfortunately a boat next to us capsized, and all the workers on board drowned. At this time, the capitalists not only did not comfort the families of the workers, but also said: It's not easy to find a boatload of four-legged dogs, but it's easy to find a boatload of two-legged people. Before liberation, I was an ordinary worker. After liberation, I am also an ordinary worker, but my experiences in the two societies are very different. After liberation, because I worked actively, the state gave me the glorious title of model worker, and I was also elected by the people as a people's representative of Shanghai. Last year, the factory sent me to Hangzhou for recuperation, and this year the state also sent me to the Soviet Union to visit, and I saw a socialist society. Sometimes I think, am I dreaming now? Why can I, an ordinary female worker, have such a happy life? No! This is not a dream, this is our real life today. The reason why we workers can live such a life is because the power of the country is already in the hands of our people, just as the Draft Constitution stipulates: all power belongs to the people.
    The Draft Constitution stipulates that our country will eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society. When I saw the four words "socialist society," my heart flew to the Soviet Union, because I personally saw the happy life of socialism. In the Soviet Union, I saw a car driver driving his own car to work, and after work, driving the public car to work. When he got off work in the evening, he drove his own car home again. In the Soviet Union, I also saw the Soviet people's selfless enthusiasm for building communism. Everyone loves their work. I saw a baker thinking of various ways to improve the work of baking bread. He said: Our work is very important. Letting everyone eat well and grow strong is our contribution to communism. Because building communism depends on the strength of everyone.
    Now, our country is carrying out a great socialist construction. The various provisions in the Draft Constitution will have a huge effect on guaranteeing our country's construction of a socialist society. It will encourage us to overcome difficulties and move forward victoriously. We must use improving technology, learning modestly, and better completing production tasks, and overfulfilling the national plan with practical actions, to thank the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the millions of comrades who shed their blood and sacrificed themselves!

    国营上海第十七棉纺织厂细纱车间乙班三排生产小组讨论宪法草案录摘要
    本报记者　于明、习平记
    七月二十六日下午，国营上海第十七棉纺织厂第二纺部细纱车间乙班三排生产小组举行了宪法草案讨论会。参加这一讨论会议的，除了乙班三排生产小组全体工人二十一人外，还有厂里老工人沈正林、丁玲娣、范红珠、朱连科、陆官郎等。以下是讨论会记录的一部分。
    有了工人阶级的领导，人民才有民主权利 
    沈正林：我今年五十七岁，二十七岁时开始做工，那时是一九二四年。三十年前，我们这个工厂是日本东洋裕丰纺绩株式会社，我们都叫它裕丰纱厂。那时我是帝国主义压迫剥削下的一个工人；而今天，三十年以后，我却坐在我们自己的工厂里，和大家一起参加制定国家的根本大法了。三十年过去了！今天看了宪法草案总纲第一条“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。”我们工人争自由、争独立的许多事情又重新涌到我心上。三十年前，中国工人在厂里处处受压迫，三个人在一起讲话，日本人就要蹋脚跟，工人每月得到的工资不够买两斗米。一九二五年二月间工人大罢工了。我记得罢工的那天早晨，工人扛一面大红旗集合到沈家桥坟山上开会，提出的口号是：“反对东洋人打人，要求增加工资。”日本帝国主义不但没有答应我们的要求，反而把我们的代表抓起来。可是工人没有被吓倒，第二天早晨，工人重新包围了警察所，要求释放代表，大家气愤地把警察所的篱笆拆散。这时帝国主义就向我们手无寸铁的人开枪，当场逮捕了二十多人。现在，我们开会，随你发表啥意见，对国家有利的，不但接受你的意见，还会受到鼓励；在路上走，你爱和谁讲话，就和谁讲话，再不会有人钉梢；我们的生活更是大大地改善了！宪法草案的各条规定，更加巩固了我们的民主权利和幸福生活。宪法草案的公布，是全国人民的大喜事，更是我们工人阶级的大喜事。我一定要带好徒弟，把全部技术教给他们，让青年人快快成长起来，为达到建成社会主义社会的目标努力。
    陆官郎：我从开始做工到现在，已经二十多年了。在这二十多年当中，除去解放后的五年时间，我受尽了痛苦的折磨，曾经三次被捕入狱。同志们或许会觉得奇怪，像我陆官郎这样的人，生性耿直，一不抢人，二不偷人，为什么会被捕吃官司呢？我说，这一点也不奇怪。在旧社会里，天下是帝国主义、官僚资本家、地主们的，他们手下有军队、有监牢，那一个人不愿意受他们欺压，就要被抓起来，道理就在这里。一九三四年，日本人打死了大康纱厂（现在国棉十二厂）工人梅世钧，我们反对帝国主义打死中国人，举行过两次示威游行，帝国主义就用逮捕和枪杀来镇压。当时，牺牲了的同志的鲜血淌满了整条街道。一九四五年抗日战争胜利以后，国民党劫收了工厂，他们和日本帝国主义一样残酷地压榨工人，同时还在厂里发展各种反革命组织。我拒绝参加反革命组织，结果就遭到逮捕。国民党匪帮打我，要我招供是谁指示我这样做，我什么也没有讲，我心里想：“许多同志流血牺牲就是为了我们求解放，鲜红的旗帜还在心里飘，我死也不能做出对不起同志的事！”解放以后，我们享受到了充分的民主权利，这都是先烈英勇斗争的结果，这都是因为我们工人阶级掌握了政权。宪法草案把工人阶级的领导权写下来了，我们应该用自己的劳动，继续为加强工人阶级的领导而奋斗。
      生活幸福，劳动光荣
    曹小妹：每个在十七厂作工的人都会看到，解放以后，我们的工厂和自己的生活有了多么大的变化。这个变化，就是我们越过越幸福了。宪法草案规定保证人民生活过得更好，那个人能不拥护呢！工厂里的设备越来越讲究，场房里装了冷风设备，又清洁又舒适；厂里开办了大食堂，工人经常能吃上鱼、肉、新鲜蔬菜；厂里有合作社，东西的价钱都比市上便宜。我们还都参加了各种学习班，不断提高政治、技术和文化水平，使我们的生活过得更有意思了，我们大家每天都是快快乐乐的上工下工。厂里有一个可以容纳七百多个儿童的托儿所，我一进托儿所的房子，就感到我们的子女真是有福气啊！再拿我自己的家庭来说，现在我和母亲、丈夫都有固定的工作，吃穿都没有困难，我的一个八岁小孩已经进了幼儿班，这件事真是我们家庭的一件大事。我解放后小产过两次，都是公家用汽车送到医院去，我在医院里花的药钱公家都负担，吃饭吃得本来很好，大夫还怕我不爱吃，常常问我想吃不想吃。现在，要是有人想破坏我们这样的好生活，想再让我们的工厂变得像解放以前那样，再让我们过盐巴放到水里当菜吃的生活，再让我们女工在车间受人辱骂和脚踢手打，那是不行了，人民的宪法会保护我们。
    陈阿弟：国家让我们讨论宪法草案，我真是高兴。宪法草案上说：公民有受教育的权利，我觉得这话一点不假。今年我的大孩子已经考取了小学，过去我们工人的子女还能上学校？早到外面拾煤渣去了！宪法草案上规定，劳动者在年老、疾病或丧失劳动能力的时候，可以得到国家的物质帮助。我说，这话也一点不假，比如去年我得了气管炎，领导上就把我送到疗养所疗养。我病快好了，坚持要回来工作，疗养所还不允许。要是在过去得了这样的病，早给开除了。我记得过去有一年厂里闹大罢工，我关了三部车，东洋人就抓住我乱踢，以后还停了我的工。在那个时候，劳动糊口还保不住，更谈不到其他。但是，我觉得现在我们享受权利和尽义务不应该分开，只有更好地尽义务，才能更多地享权利。今后我要认真遵守劳动纪律，努力完成生产计划。
    孔粉珍：我从我们工人在解放以后享受的各种权利中，懂得了工人阶级掌握领导权真是重要。宪法草案里规定，我们的国家是工人阶级领导的，一切权力都属于人民，我听了真高兴。真是，要不是我们工人阶级有了领导权，我们怎能享受许多的权利呢！我们现在有劳动权，劳动好了，就能受到尊重，我自己就是因为生产努力，被评为厂里的先进生产者。大家还选我去杭州休养，在火车上还受到人们欢迎。我们的小组长黄宝妹，生产很好，不但成了全国纺织工业劳动模范，当了上海市人民代表，参加管理国家大事，今年还被派到苏联参观。在工厂里，我们的场房清洁整齐，有冷风设备，和解放以前像火烧一样热的场房相比，差别有多大啊！国家连我们上工下工走的马路，都是经常修得平平的。可是在旧社会，我们一样做工，劳动却被人轻视，拿个饭盒子去上工，人家就说我们是讨饭的，在路上走路都躲着我们。我今年三十二岁了，才开始上学读书，老师帮助我们都很热心。我在我们工人阶级领导的国家里，享受到受教育的权利了。现在，宪法草案把我们得到的权利都写下来了，还规定了我们要建设社会主义的目标，要建设社会主义，就要加强工人阶级的领导，我要带动大家学好郝建秀工作法，提高生产，巩固我们的领导权，保证我们的日子过得更好。
    母亲、孩子受到国家保护
    陈刘弟：宪法草案上规定了母亲和孩子都要受到国家的保护。我觉得解放几年以来，已经实行了这一条。我和我的孩子就都受到了国家的保护。我常说，现在妇女和孩子过的日子，真是像在天堂里。昨天，我九岁的大孩子已经考进了学校。三个月前我生了第五个孩子，产前产后休息了五十多天，厂里还照样发给我薪金。我上班后，孩子放到厂里托儿所。领导上允许我们在工作时间内给孩子喂奶；保育员同志看到我的奶不够，每天给孩子添两次牛奶，每天下班，我抱着干净可爱的孩子回家，真是从心里乐味。
    像现在孩子们过的日子，不但我自己没有过到过，就是连我的大孩子小时候也没有过过。大孩子出世后，国民党反动派为了装门面办了个托儿所，我把孩子送去，不到一个月就瘦了。说到我小时候就更苦。我老家原住在扬州，兄弟姐妹八个，父亲租种地主的地，缴了租我们就没有吃的。我八岁的那一年，妈妈对我说：“孩子啊！不是做娘的心狠，你明天就到人家做童养媳了，到人家那里比不了家里，要多听话！”妈妈哭着把我送走了。十四岁那年，我就到工厂做工了。想想过去，比比现在，我越发觉得宪法草案真是订得好，把我们妇女和孩子的利益都写上了。
    努力建设社会主义社会
    曹秀英：宪法草案有一条说，国家保护我们的人身自由不受侵犯。这一点使我想起了自己过去的事情。我的老家是四川。小时，因为家里租种地主的土地，有一年因收成不好缴不起租子，我就被人介绍到合川纱厂作工。我一天做十二个钟头的工，吃的不好，穿的也没有。向厂里要工钱，厂里不给我；我要离开那个工厂，工厂的资本家就把介绍人找来，不让我走。到那时我才晓得，原来我是被介绍人骗卖了，他早就用了工厂的钱。以后，我和另外两个女工一起偷偷逃出了那个工厂。抗战胜利以后，我和丈夫又从重庆到了上海的工厂里来作工。我们的生活直到解放以后，才慢慢好起来。我参加了各种学习和会议，才懂得劳动是最光荣的事，这也是每个人的权利。可是在旧社会，不是没法参加劳动，就是参加了劳动，又失去了人身的自由。解放以后，已经没有人敢骗卖人了，宪法草案规定了人身自由不受侵犯，更不会有骗卖人的事了。我要更加好好生产，把国家建设得更好，使我们的权利更能得到保护。
    黄宝妹：当我接到刊印着宪法草案的报纸时，真是高兴极了。我感到以后我们工人阶级的幸福生活更有保障了。刚才沈正林、陆官郎等老工人都谈到过去我们工人如何英勇斗争的事情，如果不是先烈们流血牺牲，取得了革命胜利，像这样好的宪法草案是订不出来的。宪法草案中的每一条文都凝结着先烈们的鲜血。
    解放前，我们工人很被人轻视，进了工厂就像进了监牢。记得有一年，我从浦东乘摆渡过江，一阵风刮来，不幸在我们旁边的一只船翻了，全船工人都淹死了。资本家这时不但不抚恤工人家属，还说：要一船四只脚的狗不容易，要一船两只脚的人容易。解放前我是一个普通工人，解放后我也是个普通工人，但是我在两种社会里所经历的却大大不同。解放后因为我工作积极，国家给了我劳动模范的光荣称号，还被人民选为上海市的人民代表。去年，厂里送我到杭州休养，今年国家还派我到苏联参观，看到了社会主义社会。我有时想，现在是不是在做梦，为啥我这样一个普通的女工能得这样的幸福的生活？不！这不是做梦，是我们今天真实的生活。我们工人所以能过这样的生活，就是因为国家的权力已经握在我们人民的手里，正像宪法草案上所规定的一样：一切权力属于人民。
    宪法草案里规定，我们的国家要通过和平的道路，消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。当我看了“社会主义”这四个字以后，我的心就飞到苏联去了，因为社会主义幸福的生活我亲眼看到了。在苏联我曾看到一个汽车司机坐着自己的小汽车上班，上班后驾驶公家的车子工作；晚上下班时，他又开着自己的小汽车回家。在苏联，我也看到苏联人民为共产主义建设而忘我劳动的热情，他们每个人都热爱自己的工作。我曾看到一个面包工人想出各种办法改进烘制面包的工作，他说：我们的工作很重要，让大家吃得好，长得结实，就是我们对共产主义贡献了力量。因为建设共产主义是要靠每一个人的力量啊。
    现在，我们的国家正在进行伟大的社会主义建设，宪法草案中的各项规定，对保障我国建设社会主义社会，将发生巨大的作用。它将鼓舞我们克服困难，胜利前进。我们要用提高技术，虚心学习，更好地完成生产任务，超额完成国家计划的实际行动，答谢共产党、毛主席和千百万流血牺牲的同志们！
