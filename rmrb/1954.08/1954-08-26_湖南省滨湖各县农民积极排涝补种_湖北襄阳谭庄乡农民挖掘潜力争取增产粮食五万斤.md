In Hunan Province, the weather has been clear recently, and the water levels of rivers and lakes in the Dongting Lake area have generally fallen. Farmers in the areas where the water has receded are, under the leadership of the Party and the government, rushing to drain waterlogged fields and replant late rice. In Yiyang, Nanxian, Huarong, Changde, Lixian, Hanshou, and Taoyuan counties alone, more than 115,000 laborers and more than 18,500 waterwheels are mobilized daily. A total of more than 218,400 mu of waterlogged fields have been drained, and 128,000 mu of late rice seedlings have been planted, along with more than 60,000 mu of miscellaneous grains such as sweet potatoes and potatoes. For example, in Nandao Dyke in the Fourth District of Yiyang, there are 1,700 mu of waterlogged fields, with a water depth of four chi [approximately 4 feet]. Under the leadership of the Nandao Tang Township Party Branch, 1,200 laborers were organized to operate more than 200 waterwheels in shifts, ensuring that "people rest but the wheels don't stop." It is estimated that all the waterlogged fields can be drained within ten days, allowing for the replanting of late rice. In Lexin Dyke in the Third District of Nanxian, the east side is low, and the west side is high. The Shuhe River water level is 1.3 meters higher than the Sanxian Lake in the dyke. Storing the waterlogged water in Sanxian Lake can rescue more than 20,000 mu of mid-season rice and fields that can cultivate regenerating rice, as well as more than 30,000 mu of fields that can be planted with late rice, for a total harvest of more than 10 million jin of rice. In Jianghuang Township in the Seventh District of Huarong, six mutual aid groups implemented "small enclosures and small drainage," adding temporary water retaining embankments, draining 150 mu of fields.

In Tanzhuang Township, Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, field inspections and production are being carried out to further tap production potential. The township has decided to increase grain production by 50,000 jin on the basis of the original production plan. This year, the crops in Tanzhuang Township are growing better than last year, and some township cadres have developed the idea of "sitting and waiting for the autumn harvest," relaxing field management, and not actively responding to the call for increased production from higher levels, thinking that there is no way to increase production. After the work team that came to the township to lead production discovered these problems, they first focused on mutual aid and cooperative organizations and implemented field inspections and production. They and township cadres, agricultural cooperative directors, mutual aid group leaders, etc., went deep into the fields for inspection. The results showed that a large part of the fields of agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups had only 80% of the seedlings, and some fields were missing 30% to 50% of the seedlings; in some fields, the weeds were taller than the seedlings; and many field edges and headlands still had a lot of unused land that could be used to plant beans. This situation made the cadres realize that it is necessary to strengthen field management and tap production potential. Five agricultural cooperatives and six mutual aid groups took action first, transplanting and planting seedlings on 71.5 mu in one day, planting beans on 61 mu of field edges and headlands, weeding 47 mu, draining water to save seedlings on 180 mu, and topdressing 317 dan [approximately 31,700 kg] . The work team and the Tanzhuang Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party led everyone to summarize the production achievements of this day and further study the production potential of the entire township. Preliminary calculations show that just by doing a good job of transplanting and replanting 150 seedlings per mu of land, the entire township can increase grain production by at least 35,000 jin; coupled with weeding, topdressing, and using vacant land to plant beans, the production potential is even greater. Subsequently, a township people's representative meeting was held to study production potential and increased production. Everyone agreed that as long as field management is strengthened and more planting and harvesting are done, the entire township can increase grain production by another 50,000 jin in addition to ensuring the completion of the original production plan.

    湖南省滨湖各县农民积极排涝补种
    湖北襄阳谭庄乡农民挖掘潜力争取增产粮食五万斤
    近来，湖南天气晴朗，洞庭湖滨地区江、湖水位普遍下落，水退地区的农民正在党和政府领导下，抢排渍水，抢种晚稻，仅益阳、南县、华容、常德、澧县、汉寿、桃源七个县，每天就出动十一万五千多劳动力，一万八千五百多张水车，共已排放了二十一万八千四百多亩渍水田，并插上了晚秧十二万八千亩，种上红薯、马铃薯等杂粮六万多亩。如益阳四区南道垸，渍田一千七百多亩，水深四尺，在南道塘乡党支部领导下，组织一千二百个劳动力，出动二百多张水车，轮班车水，做到“人歇车不歇”，估计十天内可车干全部渍水，赶种晚稻；南县三区乐新垸，东面低，西面高，疏河水位比该垸内湖三仙湖要高一公尺三，把三仙湖分蓄渍水，可抢救出二万多亩中稻和可培育再生稻的田，三万多亩可插晚稻的田，共可收稻谷一千万斤以上；华容七区江黄乡六个互助组，根据地形实行“小围小排”，加筑临时围水堤，排出了一百五十亩田。（本报湖南记者站）

    湖北省襄阳县谭庄乡依靠互助合作组织，进行田间检查生产，进一步挖掘生产潜力，全乡决定在原订生产计划的基础上增产粮食五万斤。今年，谭庄乡的庄稼长的比去年好，部分乡干部便产生“坐等秋收”的思想，放松田间管理，对上级提出的增产号召不积极响应认为增产没门。来这乡领导生产的工作组发现这些问题后，首先抓住互助合作组织，实行田间检查生产。他们和乡干部、农业社长、互助组长等深入田间检查结果，发现农业社、互助组有大部分的田只有八成苗，有一部分田缺苗三成至五成；有些地里草比苗高；不少的田边地头还有很多可以种豆子的空地未加利用。这种情况使干部认识到必须加强田间管理和挖掘生产潜力。五个农业社和六个互助组首先行动起来，一天时间移苗、栽苗七十一亩半，利用田边地头种豆子六十一亩、扯草四十七亩，排水救苗一百八十亩，追肥三百一十七担。工作组和中共谭庄乡支部领导大家总结了这一天的生产成绩，进一步研究全乡的生产潜力，初步计算，仅做好每亩田移苗补苗一百五十棵一项，全乡至少能增产三万五千斤粮食；加上?草、追肥，利用空地种豆等办法，生产潜力就更大。接着召开乡人民代表会议，研究生产潜力和增产问题，大家一致认为只要加强田间管理和多种多收，全乡除保证完成原订生产计划外，可再增产粮食五万斤。（本报湖北记者站）
