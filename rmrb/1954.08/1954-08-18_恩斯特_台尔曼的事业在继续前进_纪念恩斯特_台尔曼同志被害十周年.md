    Ernst Thälmann's Cause Continues to Advance
    —Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of Comrade Ernst Thälmann's Murder
    Lin Boqu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    August 18th is a day that the German people and all peace-loving people around the world cannot forget. On this day ten years ago, Comrade Ernst Thälmann, the great leader of the German working class, who had persisted in heroic struggle in fascist prisons for eleven and a half years, was murdered by the then-dying Hitler gang.
    Ernst Thälmann was the banner of the German proletarian socialist revolution and the German people's struggle against fascism. He inherited and developed the fine traditions of the German working-class movement. This tradition was established by the founders of scientific socialism and the great teachers of the world proletarian revolution, Marx and Engels, and by the outstanding sons and daughters of the German working class, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. Thälmann dedicated his life to the cause of his class. The development of the German workers' movement, the growth of the German people's strength, and the strengthening of the German Communist Party are inseparable from Comrade Thälmann's efforts.
    Ernst Thälmann was a revolutionary leader who grew up from the workers' movement. From his youth, Thälmann became a member of the working class, working as a worker in different industries for twenty-two years. In his early working life, Thälmann was tempered in the struggle against capitalist oppression and for the basic rights of the working class, thus establishing his determination to fight to the end for the cause of the liberation of the working class. Comrade Thälmann always maintained close ties with the working class and the working people, and relied on this connection to carry out revolutionary activities.
    Ernst Thälmann began to gain the trust of the entire German working class and attract the attention of workers in various countries in the autumn of 1923, when a new revolutionary upsurge came during the post-war crisis period in Germany. Under the leadership of the German Communist Party, the German working class carried out a struggle to seize power. Ernst Thälmann, then a member of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, led the Hamburg workers' armed uprising. The Hamburg uprising became the highest peak of the entire revolutionary struggle, demonstrating the unity and strength of the working class under the leadership of its revolutionary party, and writing a brilliant page in the history of the German working-class revolutionary movement.
    Due to Comrade Thälmann's outstanding activities in leading the German workers' movement, he was elected Chairman of the German Communist Party in October 1925. Under Thälmann's leadership, the German Communist Party purged its ranks, consolidated internal unity politically and organizationally, and began a resolute struggle to win over the majority of the German working class. Based on Lenin and Stalin's theory of party building and the brilliant example of the Soviet Communist Party, Thälmann transformed and trained the German Communist Party, enhanced its combat effectiveness, and made it a decisive political force in Germany. As Comrade Walter Ulbricht said: "Comrade Ernst Thälmann's historical achievement lies in developing the German Communist Party, founded under the leadership of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, into a revolutionary mass party. He was the first to systematically instill the theories of Lenin and Stalin into the German workers' movement and the German people."
    The outbreak of the world economic crisis in 1929 and its continuation in the following years led to the intensification of imperialist contradictions and a new upsurge in the workers' movement. The German working class and working people, who were increasingly dissatisfied with capitalist rule, turned more widely toward revolution and toward the German Communist Party, which led the German people's liberation cause. In the 1932 German presidential election, the German Communist Party's candidate, Thälmann, received six million votes. The strength of the German working class and the German Communist Party rapidly developed.
    The German bourgeoisie, fearing the growth of revolutionary forces and feeling that it could no longer exploit and rule in the same way as before, embarked on the road of establishing a fascist dictatorship, using the Hitler Nazi gang as a tool for suppressing the working class internally and carrying out expansion and aggression externally.
    At a critical juncture when the German nation was facing a major crisis, Thälmann pointed out to the German people the path to liberation from the shackles of imperialism and the threat of fascism, and led the German Communist Party and the German people in an effort to establish a united front and organize a joint anti-fascist struggle. Thälmann then suggested joint action to the leaders of the Social Democratic Party, but was rejected. The leaders of the Social Democratic Party helped the Hitler gang come to power with their betrayal and division of the working class.
    The German Communist Party under the leadership of Comrade Ernst Thälmann became the most steadfast and powerful force of the German people against fascist rule. The Hitler gang arrested Comrade Thälmann in March 1933, in an attempt to strike a blow against the German workers' movement.
    The torture, abuse, and torment that Thälmann suffered in fascist prisons are countless. But this long-term imprisonment and torture could not shake him in the slightest. His firm and unyielding struggle in prison demonstrated Comrade Thälmann's noble qualities as a proletarian revolutionary fighter, his infinite loyalty to the cause of the working class, and his confidence in the victory of this cause. In his last prison testament—a letter to a comrade-in-arms—Comrade Thälmann wrote: "The facts of our lives are harsh, and therefore it demands that all people, you, me, and all comrades-in-arms who are fighting for our great cause, be tenacious, firm, and brave, and have strong confidence in the future. Because the meaning of being a revolutionary fighter lies in maintaining unwavering loyalty to the cause (this loyalty must be the same in life and death), in showing unconditional reliability, firm confidence, fighting courage, and activity under any circumstances." Comrade Thälmann's spirit of dedication and unyieldingness to the cause of communism encouraged German patriots to stick to their fighting posts in the darkest years.
    Thälmann was an outstanding Marxist-Leninist. In order to guide the struggle of the German working-class revolution with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, Thälmann had diligently studied the classic works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Precisely because he mastered the weapon of Marxism-Leninism, Thälmann was often able to make thorough and scientific analyses of the complex political and economic situation in Germany, and formulate the Party's tactics and strategies in a timely manner based on this analysis. At the same time, he used the viewpoint of historical materialism to understand and expound on German historical events, clearly exposing the roots of the imperialist war crisis and the essence of fascism, and mercilessly attacking the social-democratic theories that attempted to whitewash the evils of capitalism and reconcile class struggle.
    It has been ten years since Comrade Thälmann was murdered. In these ten years, the situation in Germany and the world has undergone fundamental changes. Under the powerful blows of the Soviet army, the Hitler gang has met its deserved and shameful end. Due to the great victory of the Soviet Union, a series of countries in Europe and Asia have broken away from the capitalist system and embarked on the road of development towards socialism, and together with the Soviet Union, have formed a strong camp of peace and democracy. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the people of East Germany established the German Democratic Republic in 1949, which is a great victory for the German people's strength and a turning point in European history. With the efforts of the German people and the support of the people of the world, the German Democratic Republic has today become a fortress of peace-loving forces in all of Germany, and its strength and role are growing day by day.
    However, due to the US imperialist policy of dividing Germany and reviving German militarism, Germany remains divided to this day. The American ruling clique and its lackey, the Bonn government, are attempting new adventures, leading the German nation back onto the road of war. This adventurous policy will bring even greater disasters not only to the German people but also to the people of Europe.
    In this situation, the German working class and the German people shoulder a very arduous historical task, which is to fight for the realization of Germany's peace, democracy, and unification. In this struggle, the German people have received the sympathy and support of the entire peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world.
    The Chinese people are deeply concerned about and fully support the just struggle of the German people. In his recent foreign policy report to the Central People's Government Committee, Premier Zhou Enlai of our country pointed out: "We firmly oppose the United States' reactionary policy of reviving German militarism and long-term division of Germany, and fully support the great struggle of the entire German people for the peaceful reunification of Germany." The Chinese people firmly believe that the German state and the German nation, which have contributed Marx and Engels, Beethoven and Heine to mankind, will never be allowed to be divided, nor can they be divided. With the efforts of the German people and the support of the people of the world, the German question will eventually be resolved peacefully on the basis of respecting the interests of the German nation. The fascist gang and German imperialism murdered Thälmann, the great leader of the German working class, but they could not stifle the great cause of the German working class for which Comrade Thälmann fought to his last breath. Ernst Thälmann's cause has achieved victory in the German Democratic Republic, and this cause is continuing to advance today and will achieve final and complete victory! (Attached picture)

    恩斯特·台尔曼的事业在继续前进
    ——纪念恩斯特·台尔曼同志被害十周年
    中国共产党中央委员会政治局委员  林伯渠
    八月十八日，是德国人民和全世界爱好和平人民不能忘怀的日子。十年前的这一天，在法西斯监狱中坚持英勇斗争达十一年半之久的德国工人阶级的伟大领袖恩斯特·台尔曼同志，竟被当时已经垂死的希特勒匪帮所杀害了。
    恩斯特·台尔曼是德国无产阶级社会主义革命和德国人民反对法西斯主义斗争的旗帜，他继承了和发扬了德国工人阶级运动的优良传统。这种传统，是由科学社会主义的奠基人和世界无产阶级革命的伟大导师马克思、恩格斯，由德国工人阶级的优秀儿女卡尔·李卜克内西和罗莎·卢森堡所建立起来的。台尔曼把他的一生贡献给了自己阶级的事业。代德国工人运动的发展，德国人民力量的成长以及德国共产党的壮大，是和台尔曼同志的努力分不开的。
    恩斯特·台尔曼是从工人运动中成长起来的革命领袖。台尔曼从少年时代起就成为工人阶级队伍的一员，他曾做过二十二年的不同行业的工人。在早年的工人生活中，台尔曼就在反对资本主义压迫、争取工人阶级基本权利的斗争中受到了锻炼，从而树立起了为争取工人阶级解放事业而奋斗到底的决心。台尔曼同志和工人阶级及劳动人民始终保持密切的联系，并依靠这一联系进行革命的活动。
    恩斯特·台尔曼开始获得全德国工人阶级的信任和引起各国工人阶级的注意，是在一九二三年秋天，那时，德国战后危机时期中的新的革命高潮到来了。德国工人阶级在德国共产党的领导下进行夺取政权的斗争，恩斯特·台尔曼当时是德国共产党中央委员，他领导了汉堡工人武装起义。汉堡起义成为整个革命斗争的最高峰，表现了工人阶级在自己的革命政党领导之下的团结一致和强大力量，在德国工人阶级革命运动的历史上写下了光辉的一页。
    由于台尔曼同志在领导德国工人运动方面的杰出活动，他在一九二五年十月当选为德国共产党主席。在台尔曼的领导之下，德国共产党清洗了自己的队伍，在政治上、组织上巩固了内部的团结，并开始了争取德国工人阶级多数的坚决斗争。台尔曼根据列宁、斯大林的建党学说和苏联共产党的光辉榜样，改造了和锻炼了德国共产党，提高了它的战斗力，使它成为德国的一个起决定性作用的政治力量。正如瓦尔特·乌布利希同志所说的：“恩斯特·台尔曼同志的历史功绩，在于他把在卡尔·李卜克内西和罗莎·卢森堡领导下创立起来的德国共产党发展成为一个革命的群众性政党，他第一个把列宁和斯大林的学说有系统地灌输给德国工人运动和德国人民”。
    一九二九年世界经济危机的爆发及其在此后数年内的延续，引起了帝国主义矛盾的尖锐化和工人运动的新的高涨。对于资本主义统治日益感到不满的德国工人阶级和劳动人民，更加广泛地倾向革命，转向领导德国人民解放事业的德国共产党。一九三二年德国总统选举中，德国共产党的候选人——台尔曼获得六百万张选票。德国工人阶级与德国共产党的力量迅速发展起来。
    德国资产阶级害怕革命力量的增长，感到已不能以从前的方式来实行剥削和统治，便走上了建立法西斯独裁的道路，利用希特勒纳粹匪帮来作为对内镇压工人阶级、对外进行扩张侵略的罪恶工具。
    在德国民族面临着重大危机的严重的关头，台尔曼向德国人民指出了从帝国主义枷锁和法西斯威胁下争取解放的道路，并领导德国共产党和德国人民为建立统一战线、组织反法西斯的联合斗争而努力。台尔曼当时曾向社会民主党的领袖们建议采取一致行动，但遭到了拒绝。社会民主党的领袖们以背叛和分裂工人阶级的行为，帮助了希特勒匪帮登台执政。
    恩斯特·台尔曼同志领导下的德国共产党成为德国人民反对法西斯统治的最坚定、最强大的力量。希特勒匪帮在一九三三年三月逮捕了台尔曼同志，企图借此打击德国工人运动。
    台尔曼在法西斯监狱中遭受的折磨、虐待和酷刑是罄竹难书的。但这种长期的监禁和折磨却丝毫也不能使他动摇。他在监狱中的坚强不屈的斗争，表现了台尔曼同志作为无产阶级革命战士的崇高品质，表现了他对于工人阶级事业的无限忠诚和对这一事业的胜利信心。台尔曼同志在他最后的狱中遗书——给一位战友的信里这样写道：“我们生命的史实是严酷的，因此它就要求所有的人们，你，我以及一切为我们伟大事业而斗争的战友们，都要顽强、都要坚定、都要英勇，而且对将来都要有坚强的信心。因为做革命战士的意义，就在保持对于事业的永不变节的忠诚（这种忠诚是要生死如一的），就在处于任何局面之下都表现出无条件的可靠、坚定的信心、战斗勇气和活动力。”台尔曼同志这种献身于共产主义事业的忠贞不屈的精神，鼓舞了德国爱国者在最黑暗的年月中坚守自己的战斗岗位。
    台尔曼是杰出的马克思列宁主义者。为了用马克思列宁主义的理论来指导德国工人阶级革命的斗争，台尔曼曾经不倦地对马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的经典著作进行过十分刻苦的钻研。正是因为掌握了马克思列宁主义的武器，台尔曼经常能够对德国复杂的政治形势与经济情况作出缜密的科学分析，并根据这种分析来及时地订出党的策略和战略；同时以历史唯物主义的观点来认识与阐明德国的历史事件，清楚地揭露帝国主义战争危机的根源和法西斯主义的本质，并对企图粉饰资本主义罪恶、调和阶级斗争的社会民主主义理论给予无情的打击。
    自从台尔曼同志被害到现在已经十周年了。在这十年里，德国和世界的局势已经起了根本的变化。在苏联军队的强大打击下，希特勒匪帮已得到了应得的可耻下场。由于苏联的伟大胜利，欧洲和亚洲的一系列国家已脱离了资本主义的体系，走上了向社会主义发展的道路，并与苏联一起结成了强大的和平民主阵营。在德国统一社会党的领导下，东德人民在一九四九年建立了德意志民主共和国，这是德国人民力量的伟大胜利和欧洲历史的转折点。在德国人民的努力和全世界人民的支持下，德意志民主共和国今天已成为全德国爱好和平力量的堡垒，它的力量与作用正在一天比一天增长。
    但是，由于美帝国主义所奉行的分裂德国与复活德国军国主义的政策，德国直到今天还一直被分裂着。美国统治集团和它的走狗波恩政府正在企图进行新的冒险，把德国民族重新引上战争的道路。这种冒险政策将不仅使德国人民而且也将使欧洲各国人民遭到更加深重的灾难。
    在这种情况下，德国工人阶级和德国人民，肩负着十分艰巨的历史任务，这就是：为实现德国的和平、民主、统一而斗争。在这个斗争中，德国人民得到了以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民的同情和支持。
    中国人民十分关心和全力支持德国人民的正义斗争。我国周恩来总理在最近举行的中央人民政府委员会上所作的外交报告中指出：“我们坚决反对美国复活德国军国主义和长期分裂德国的反动政策，并全力支持全德意志人民为要求和平统一德国的伟大斗争。”中国人民深信，曾经给人类贡献了马克思和恩格斯、贝多芬和海涅的德意志国家和德意志民族是决不允许，也决不可能被分裂的。在德国人民的努力和全世界人民的支持之下，德国问题最终必将在尊重德国民族利益的基础上得到和平的解决。法西斯匪帮和德国帝国主义杀害了德国工人阶级的伟大领袖台尔曼，但是它们却不可能扼杀台尔曼同志为之斗争到最后一息的伟大的德国工人阶级事业。恩斯特·台尔曼的事业已在德意志民主共和国取得了胜利，这一事业今天正在继续前进，并将取得最后的完全的胜利！（附图片）
