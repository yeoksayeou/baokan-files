Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 9th: Twenty-seven hydrological stations along the Yangtze River universally recorded simultaneous water level drops this morning. According to water situation reports from various stations, at 8:00 AM this morning, the water levels at twenty-seven stations along the Yangtze River, stretching over 2,000 kilometers from Lizhuang (about 50 li east of Yibin) in Sichuan Province to Datong (over 100 li east of Anqing) in Anhui Province, generally fell, except for minor rises at Hankou and Xindi stations. This is a rare new development since the start of the flood season this summer. The degree of water level drop varied: the Yangtze River's upper reaches, from Lizhuang to Cuntan, experienced a drop of about 1 to 2 meters; from Qingxichang in the upper reaches to Jianli in the middle reaches, the drop was about 2 to 4 decimeters; and from Huangshigang in the middle reaches to Datong in the lower reaches, the drop was 3 to 5 centimeters. Only Hankou rose by 1 centimeter, and Xindi by 4 centimeters.

Rainfall at various stations along the Yangtze River in early August was significantly less than in July. This is one of the important reasons for the simultaneous water level drops at these stations. According to statistics, the total rainfall at twenty-nine stations along the Yangtze River from Lizhuang to Jiangyin in July was 11,685 millimeters. In the first nine days of August, the total rainfall at thirty-three stations (including four newly established stations) was about one-eighth of the July figure. This situation will boost the confidence of the people along the Yangtze River, who are bravely fighting the floods, in finally overcoming this year's unusual flood.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 9th: This morning, the Yangtze River water level at the Wuhan Customs station once rose to 29.30 meters, but by 3:00 PM, it had fallen back to 29.28 meters. This is the third day that the water level has exceeded the historical high by more than one meter. Over one hundred kilometers of dikes in Wuhan City are still under the staunch defense of over 100,000 flood-fighting troops.

Since August 2nd, Wuhan City has experienced clear weather. So far, there has been a rare stretch of clear weather lasting more than a week since July, which is beneficial for accelerating the completion of flood control projects. However, due to the successive arrival of flood peaks from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the Han River, the water level in the Wuhan area has risen. The Wuhan Customs station water level has exceeded 29 meters since the morning of August 4th, and has continued for six days, with frequent winds of force four or five. In recent days, some dangerous situations have been detected in individual dike sections, but they were immediately addressed by the rescue teams. Wave-breaking wooden rafts outside the Zhanggong Dike have played a significant role in the heavy winds and waves. Currently, timber is also being transported to the dikes along the river to construct wave-breaking wooden rafts to reduce the threat of wind and waves.

### 长江二千公里沿线水位下降  武汉连日战胜风浪威胁水位稍有回落

    长江二千公里沿线水位下降  武汉连日战胜风浪威胁水位稍有回落
    【新华社武汉九日电】九日晨长江二十七个水文站，普遍同时落水。据各站水情报告，九日上午八时从四川省李庄（宜宾东约五十里）起到安徽省大通（安庆东约百余里）止，长江二千多公里沿线二十九个站的水位，除汉口和新堤两站微涨外，二十七个站的水位普遍下落。这是长江入夏以来少有的新情况。水位降落差度不一：长江上游从李庄到寸滩段落水一公尺到二公尺左右，从上游清溪场到中游监利段落水二公寸到四公寸左右，从中游黄石港到下游大通段落水三公分到五公分。仅汉口涨一公分，新堤涨四公分。
    八月上旬，长江各站降雨量比七月份大大减少。这是这次各站同时落水的重要原因之一。据统计：长江从李庄到江阴二十九个站七月份总降雨量为一万一千六百八十五公厘，八月上旬九天三十三个站（有四个新设站）总降雨量约为七月份的八分之一，这一情况将给英勇地和洪水搏斗的长江沿线人民，为最后战胜今年异常的洪水增强了信心。
    【新华社武汉九日电】九日清晨，武汉关的长江水位曾一度上涨到二九点三零公尺，下午三时又回落到二九点二八公尺。这已经是超过历年最高水位一公尺以上的第三天了。武汉市一百多公里的堤防，至今仍然在十多万防汛大军的坚决守卫中。
    武汉市自八月二日起天气晴朗，到目前为止，出现了从今年七月以来稀有的为时一周以上的晴朗天气，对于防汛工程争取加速完工很有好处。但由于长江上游和汉水相继出现洪峰，因而造成武汉地区水位上涨。武汉关水位自八月四日晨起超过了二十九公尺，至今已持续六天，并且经常有四、五级的大风。连日来在个别堤段曾发现若干险情，但立即为抢险队救护。张公堤外的防浪木排在大风浪中起了很大作用。目前沿江大堤也正在运送木材，准备架设防浪木排，以减轻风浪威胁。
