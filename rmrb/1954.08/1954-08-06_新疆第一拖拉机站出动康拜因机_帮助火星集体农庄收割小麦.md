    Xinjiang's First Tractor Station Sends Combine Harvesters to Help Mars Collective Farm Harvest Wheat
    Xinjiang's First Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station dispatched a combine harvester for the first time to help the Mars Collective Farm in Urumqi County harvest wheat.
    This year, the Mars Collective Farm had a bumper harvest of 1,655 mu of winter and spring wheat, with an average yield of more than 300 jin per mu, exceeding the original planned yield per unit area by more than 74 percent. The collective farm's horse-drawn wheat cutting team and the combine harvester cooperated well, and all harvesting has now been completed. During the harvest, about 2,000 farmers of all ethnic groups came from various places to visit.
    Simultaneous with the summer harvest, the tractor station also dispatched tractors to help the Mars Collective Farm reclaim more than 1,000 mu of wasteland and plow 3,000 mu of cultivated wasteland.

    新疆第一拖拉机站出动康拜因机
    帮助火星集体农庄收割小麦
    新疆第一农业机器拖拉机站首次出动一架康拜因自动收割机，帮助乌鲁木齐县火星集体农庄收割小麦。
    今年火星集体农庄一千六百五十五亩冬春小麦丰收，平均每亩产三百多斤，超过原计划单位面积产量百分之七十四以上。集体农庄组织的马拉割麦机队和康拜因收割机配合得很好，现已全部收割完毕。收割期间，从各处赶来参观的各族农民有两千人左右。
    和夏收同时，拖拉机站还出动拖拉机帮助火星集体农庄开生荒地一千多亩和翻犁熟荒地三千亩。
