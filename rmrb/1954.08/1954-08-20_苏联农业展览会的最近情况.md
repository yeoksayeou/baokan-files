    Recent Situation of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition
    Our reporter Li He reports from Moscow: On the 17th, I visited Academician N.V. Tsitsin, the General Director of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, and inquired about the situation of the exhibition visitors, the significance of the Maltsev new cultivation method, and its impact on the Williams theory.

    Tsitsin said: In addition to the numerous visitors, 18,500 organized agricultural laborers study at the exhibition every day. They come from collective farm members, machine tractor station and state farm workers, agronomists, etc., from all over the country. Each group studies for five days. These organized visitors stay in various hotels and clubs. Sixty hotels, each capable of accommodating 500 people, are under construction, so next year there will be 30,000 organized visitors every day. As of the 17th, 187 foreign delegations, including 2,800 people, have visited. The exhibition adopts methods such as guided tours, lectures, and screening of agricultural films to widely disseminate advanced agricultural experiences. After November, the exhibition will open short-term training courses in some exhibition halls, such as the "Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification" exhibition hall, to improve the technical level of agricultural personnel, training 10,000 people per term.

    Tsitsin said: Williams' theory of grass-arable rotation with perennial grasses was derived from research in non-black soil areas. It needs to be corrected that it has become a dogma and used everywhere in the Soviet Union. The Maltsev cultivation method is a kind of correction. The main content of this cultivation method is deep plowing with a non-moldboard plow. The land is plowed in the first year of a four-year cycle, and the soil is only loosened in the other three years. Using this cultivation method, a stable yield of about 2,000 kilograms of spring wheat can be guaranteed every year. This cultivation method will be experimented with according to local soil and climatic conditions, and it will be more advanced in the experiment.

    苏联农业展览会的最近情况
    本报记者李何自莫斯科报道：十七日我访问了苏联农业展览会总干事尼·维·齐津院士，询以展览会参观者的情况和马尔采夫新耕作法的意义和对威廉姆斯理论的影响。
    齐津说：除了许许多多参观的人们以外，每天有一万八千五百有组织的农业劳动者在展览会学习，他们是来自全国各地的集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场工作人员、农艺师等等。他们每批学习五天。这些有组织的参观者住在各旅馆和俱乐部。正在建筑着分别能够容纳五百人的旅馆六十座，所以明年每天有组织的参观者将达三万。截至十七日为止，已有一百八十七个外国代表团，包括两千八百人来参观过。展览会采取了引导参观、讲演、放映农业电影片子等等方法，广泛地传播农业先进经验。展览会到十一月后将在某些展览馆，如在“农业机械化和电气化”展览馆，开设短期训练班，以提高农业人员的技术水平，每期训练一万人。
    齐津说：威廉姆斯关于种多年生草的草田轮作制的理论，是研究非黑土地区得出来的。把它变成教条在全苏联到处用，这是需要改正的。马尔采夫耕作法就是一种改正。这个耕作法主要内容是用无铧板的犁深耕，四年中第一年犁地，其他三年只要松土。用这种耕作法每年保证春小麦取得两千公斤左右的稳定的丰产。这个耕作法将根据各地土壤和气候条件进行实验，在实验中当会更加进步。
