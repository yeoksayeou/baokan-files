    A Foot Higher Water, A Ten Foot Higher Dyke
    Hao Pu
    In late July, flood prevention on both sides of the Huai River entered a tense stage. In response to the call to "ensure the riverbanks," tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Huai River joined the ranks of flood prevention and rescue. Among these ranks was the strongest force, the commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Bengbu. Hearing the mobilization for flood prevention and rescue, and seeing the floodwaters about to breach the dikes, everyone felt deeply moved and felt that defeating the flood became their primary responsibility.
    The countless lives and properties on both sides of the Huai River, the fertile fields and thriving crops on both sides of the Huai River, inspired them to join this battle. They came to the dikes, and the tense battle began!
    During the earth carrying, the soldiers all competed to carry more, proposing: "Carrying one more basket of earth can protect one more point of happiness for the people!" The soldier Yan ChengGui carried a basket of earth equal to two, no, it seemed like three baskets carried by others. On the 26th, he broke the rope after only carrying a few baskets. Comrades advised him to carry less, but he said: "In this tense situation, earth is the weapon to defeat the flood." Some soldiers carried earth, one could not say they were walking, they were practically running! The soldier Xue XiaoZeng, from a place 150 meters away, could carry two baskets of earth on average every three minutes. Xu FengZhang carried two hundred loads in one day. Some soldiers, while carrying earth, ran and said: "The flood is big, but not as big as our determination; the flood is high, but not as high as the dike we build."
    Indeed, the flood was rising day by day, but the dikes built by the soldiers were getting higher day by day than the flood, just as the soldiers said: "Man will surely conquer nature; if the water rises a foot, our dike will rise ten feet."
    The 27th was the day the flood peak arrived, and also the most tense day. The flood rose sharply, and the storm blew the flood's spray onto the dikes. The sides of many riverbanks were being eroded by the flood, and the situation was extremely urgent.
    "We must block the flood!" Under a loud slogan, dozens of soldiers jumped into the river and used sandbags, sacks, tree stumps, doors, rotten cotton... in short, anything that could be used was used to block the flood. Other soldiers, in the storm, in waist-deep water, carried earth back and forth on the riverbanks. Some soldiers fell several times while carrying earth; some soldiers shivered from the cold in the river water, but at this time when the lives of millions of people were at stake, who would care about these things!
    The flood was rising, the dike body was being raised, and dangers were constantly appearing, but were constantly being overcome by the soldiers. The storm stopped, and the flood was finally conquered by the soldiers. When they were victorious, they proudly said their self-composed jingle to the rolling flood:
    On the banks north of the Huai River,
    It's like a big battlefield,
    This battlefield is different from usual,
    It uses shovels and earth to block the flood.

    水高一尺堤高一丈
    郝仆
    七月下旬，淮河两岸的防汛进入了紧张阶段，为了响应“确保河堤”的号召，淮河两岸成千上万的人投入了防洪抢险的行列，在这个行列中有一支最坚强的队伍，那就是驻在蚌埠市英勇的中国人民解放军某部的全体指挥员和战斗员们。他们听了防洪抢险的动员，他们看着就要越堤的洪水，一个个心里十分激动，都觉得战胜洪水成了他们的主要责任。
    淮河两岸无数的生命财产，淮河两岸的良田沃野和茁壮的庄稼鼓舞着他们投入这场战斗。他们来到了堤岸上，紧张的战斗开始了！
    在抬土中战士们都争着要多抬，他们提出：“多抬一筐土就能为人民多保住一分幸福！”战士严成贵他每次抬的一筐土就等于别人抬的两筐，不，就好像三筐似的，二十六号那天，他没抬几筐土就把绳子坠断了。同志们劝他少抬一点，他还说：“在这紧张的情况下，土，就是战胜洪水的武器。”有些战士抬土，就不能说他是在走，简直在跑！战士薛效曾在一百五十公尺以外的地方，平均每三分钟就能抬两筐土。许凤章在一天内就担了两百担。有的战士抬着土，一边跑一边还说：“洪水大，没有咱们的决心大；洪水高，没有咱们筑的堤岸高。”
    是的，洪水是一天天地在涨，可是战士们修的堤一天天比洪水高，正如战士们说的：“人，一定能胜天的；水高一尺，咱的堤就高一丈。”
    二十七号这天，是洪峰到来的一天，也是最紧张的一天，洪水骤涨，暴风把洪水的浪花都吹到堤上来了。很多河堤的堤边被洪水冲击的往下垮土，情况十分紧急。
      “一定堵住洪水！”在一声响亮的口号下，几十个战士跳到河里用沙包、麻袋、树桩、门板、烂棉絮……总之，能够用得上的东西都用来塞洪水了。其他的战士在暴风雨中，在齐腰的水里抬着土在河堤上来回奔跑。有些战士抬着土摔了几跤；有些战士在河水里冷的打颤，但就在这决定千百万人生命的时候，谁还顾及这些啊！
    洪水在上涨，堤身在加高，险情在不断出现，又被战士们不断克服。暴风雨停止了，洪水终于被战士们战胜了，在将近一千公尺长的一段淮堤上，九百多个战士在七小时内，用五万多筐土堵住了洪水，挡住了洪峰。
    一场紧张的战斗过去了，战士们战胜了洪水。当他们胜利的时候，他们对着滚滚的洪水骄傲地说着自己编的顺口溜：
    淮河北边堤岸上，
    好像一个大战场，
    这个战场不同往常，
    它是用铁锹，泥土把洪水挡。
