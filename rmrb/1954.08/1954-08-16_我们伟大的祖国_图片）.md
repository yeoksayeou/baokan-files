    Our Great Motherland
    Qiling Township in Yongding County, Fujian Province, is an old revolutionary base area that has persisted in revolutionary struggle for more than 20 years and has been devastated by the Kuomintang reactionaries for a long time. After liberation, the People's Government gave great care and helped the local people develop production and restore schools. These two farmers' children are both top students at the central primary school in Qiling Township.
