Why Gunfire Rang Out in Busan
	Yan Nan

On the evening of July 31st, gunfire suddenly rang out near the Busan Neutral Nations Supervisory Team (NNST) residence. South Korean secret service thugs opened fire, attempting to murder Czechoslovakian staff members of the inspection team. On the evening of August 1st, another group of secret service thugs threw three bombs at the Kunsan NNST residence, one of which exploded. These two terrorist incidents occurred immediately after the "statement" by the Lee Seung-man (Syngman Rhee) puppet government's "Military Police Commander" Won Yong-duk (Won Yong-deok), which aimed to sabotage the Korean Armistice Agreement. In his "statement," Won Yong-duk shamelessly threatened the Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the NNST to "immediately withdraw" from South Korea, otherwise they would face "inevitable, spontaneous disposal." Now, this so-called "spontaneous disposal" has begun, and according to a Seoul dispatch from United Press International on August 2nd, observers in Seoul "expect" that these "so-called 'spontaneous' mass demonstrations will increase along with violent incidents."

Just two days before Won Yong-duk made his "statement," Lee Seung-man delivered a frenzied, warmongering speech in the United States Congress. He not only clamored that the Korean Armistice Agreement was "dead," but also clamored for an attack on China with a fantasized "Asian army of over two million, aided by American artillery, aircraft, and ships." Lee Seung-man's wild clamor was applauded by American warmongers. Senator Wiley praised this clamor as "filled with American ideals." One can draw the same conclusion from this: the gunfire in Busan is also filled with the voice of America. Regarding the terrorist actions of the South Korean secret service thugs, the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, Taylor, actually expressed that he would "not give it public attention," and "the Allied Command has not said a word of protest" (United Press), indicating that these terrorist incidents occurred with the encouragement of the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles publicly slandered the NNST as "ineffective" at a press conference on August 3rd, and threatened to propose a suggestion to "dissolve" the NNST at the next United Nations General Assembly. This further demonstrates that the American aggressors and the Lee Seung-man gang are taking new steps to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Recently, in order to create international tension, the United States has been stepping up its activities to expand and train the Lee Seung-man puppet army. American warmonger Van Fleet has repeatedly "visited" South Korea and discussed plans to expand the Lee puppet army with Lee Seung-man. A few days ago, Lee Seung-man was summoned to Washington by U.S. President Eisenhower for talks. It is said that the United States agreed in the talks to provide Lee Seung-man with a large number of jet aircraft, ships, and other military equipment. "Aid" to South Korea has also increased from more than 800 million US dollars per year to more than 1 billion US dollars per year, and the plan to expand the training of the Lee puppet army has also been expanded. In order to transport these reinforcements to South Korea, they must pass through South Korean ports. However, there is an American "thorn in the side" in these ports - the NNST, monitoring the American behavior of undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement. Therefore, the United States encouraged the Lee Seung-man gang to hastily adopt rogue tactics and use pistols and bombs to threaten the work of the NNST.

After the United States broke off discussions on a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, it stepped up its conspiracy to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement. Recently, the U.S. side has continuously dispatched armed agents to intrude into the demilitarized zone under our control and our areas to carry out sabotage activities. On July 29th, U.S. military personnel illegally intruded into the demilitarized zone under our control and shot and wounded one of our civil police officers. On August 1st, a U.S. military aircraft intruded into the airspace near Kaesong, where the Korean-Chinese delegation is located, and the airspace above the headquarters of the Military Armistice Commission. These are all serious incidents that violate the Korean Armistice Agreement. These incidents, coupled with the clamor of Dulles, Lee Seung-man, and Won Yong-duk, as well as the sound of gunfire and bombs in Busan and Kunsan, clearly show that the American-Lee gang's actions to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement have become even more frenzied, and the American conspiracy to equip and expand the Lee puppet army in order to carry out new military adventures is even more exposed. This is something we must be vigilant about. The conspiracies and sabotage activities of the American-Lee gang must be defeated, and the Korean Armistice Agreement and peace in Korea must be maintained!

    釜山为什么响起了枪声
    燕南
    七月三十一日晚上，釜山中立国视察小组住所附近突然响起了枪声，南朝鲜的特务暴徒开枪谋杀视察小组的捷克斯洛伐克工作人员。八月一日晚上，另一群特务暴徒又向群山中立国视察小组住所里投了三颗炸弹，其中有一颗爆炸了。这两起恐怖事件，是在李承晚伪政府“宪兵司令官”元容德发表破坏朝鲜停战协定的“声明”之后，紧接着发生的。元容德在他的“声明”中无耻地威胁中立国监察委员会的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员“立即撤出”南朝鲜，否则就会遭到“不可避免的、自发的处置”。现在，这种所谓“自发的处置”已经开始了，而且据美国国际新闻社汉城八月二日电讯报道，汉城的观察家“预料”，这种“被称为‘自发的’群众示威将和暴力事件一道多起来”。
    就在元容德发表“声明”的前两天，李承晚在美国国会中作了一次疯狂的好战演说。他不仅叫嚣着朝鲜停战协定已经“寿终正寝”，而且叫嚣着要用幻想中的“一支两百多万人的亚洲军队，在美国的大炮、飞机和舰只的帮助下”进攻中国。李承晚的疯狂叫嚣，获得了美国好战分子的喝采，参议员维利赞扬这种叫嚣“充满了美国人的理想”。人们从这里可以得出同样的结论：釜山的枪声中也充满了美国的声音。对于南朝鲜特务暴徒的恐怖行动，侵朝美军第八军军长泰勒竟表示“不予公开注意”，“联军司令部未曾说过一句抗议的话”（合众社），这说明这种恐怖事件是在美国的怂恿下发生的。美国国务卿八月三日在记者招待会上公开诬蔑中立国监察委员会“不起作用”，并且扬言要在下届联合国大会上提出“解散”中立国监察委员会的建议。这更说明了美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮正在采取新的步骤来破坏朝鲜停战协议。
    最近一个时期，美国为了制造国际紧张局势，正加紧进行扩充和训练李承晚伪军的活动。美国好战分子范佛里特曾一再地“访问”南朝鲜，和李承晚商讨扩充李伪军计划。前些天，李承晚又被美国总统艾森豪威尔唤到华盛顿去举行会谈，据说美国在会谈中已经同意：给予李承晚大量的喷气式飞机、舰艇和其他的军事装备，对南朝鲜的“援助”也从每年八亿美元以上增加到每年十亿美元以上，并且扩大训练李伪军的计划。美国要把这些增援物资运到南朝鲜去，就得经过南朝鲜的港口，然而在这些港口上又有美国的“眼中钉”——中立国视察小组，监视着美国破坏朝鲜停战协定的行为。因此，美国就怂恿李承晚匪帮，急忙地采用了流氓无赖的手段，拿出手枪和炸弹来威胁中立国监察委员会的工作了。
    美国在日内瓦会议上破裂了和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论之后，加紧进行破坏朝鲜停战协定的阴谋活动。最近美方不断派遣的武装特务，侵入我方控制的非军事区和我方地区进行破坏活动。七月二十九日，美方军事人员又非法侵入我方控制下的非军事区，开枪击伤我方民政警察一名。八月一日，美方军用飞机一架，竟侵入朝中代表团所在地开城附近上空和军事停战委员会总部区上空。这些都是违反朝鲜停战协定的严重事件。这些事件再加上杜勒斯、李承晚和元容德的叫嚣，以及釜山和群山的枪声和炸弹声，很明显地说明美李匪帮破坏朝鲜停战协定的行动更加疯狂了，美国装备和扩充李伪军以便进行新的军事冒险的阴谋更加暴露了。这是我们必须加以警惕的。美李匪帮的这种阴谋和破坏行动必须击败，朝鲜停战协定和朝鲜的和平必须维护！
