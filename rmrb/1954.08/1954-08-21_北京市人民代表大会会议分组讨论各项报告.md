Xinhua News Agency report: The first session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress held a plenary meeting on the morning of the 19th. Mayor Peng Zhen delivered a report on the work of the Beijing Municipal People's Government on behalf of the Municipal People's Government. Over the past three days, five group meetings have been held to discuss the government work report, the report on the work of publicizing and discussing the draft constitution, and the report on financial revenue and expenditure budgets.

The representatives expressed their heartfelt support for the government's achievements over the past five years. The discussions unanimously reflected that the report showed the broad prospects for the capital's socialist construction and its infinitely beautiful future. The representatives also confidently expressed that they would jointly shoulder the major tasks of building the capital in the future.

The representatives had extremely enthusiastic discussions on the task of liberating Taiwan, as proposed in Mayor Peng Zhen's report, and unanimously expressed their determination to support the People's Liberation Army and liberate our territory of Taiwan, and rescue the Taiwanese compatriots in dire straits, with practical actions to step up production and work hard.

The representatives cited many vivid facts in their discussions to illustrate that the publicity and discussion of the draft constitution was a profound education in socialism and the people's democratic system. It not only furthered the understanding of the superiority of the people's democratic system, but also inspired the political enthusiasm for building socialism, promoted current work, and strengthened the people's awareness of abiding by the law and maintaining social public order. The representatives expressed that they would frequently conduct propaganda related to the draft constitution among the people.

In discussing the report on financial revenue and expenditure budgets, everyone felt that the report fully reflected that the socialist economy had been given priority in national construction and that the material and cultural life of the people had been further improved; this year's financial budget will also promote the further development of the national economy. Many representatives from factories and suburban areas, as well as representatives from industry and commerce, expressed that they would further increase production, increase income, practice strict economy, and support and implement the Beijing Municipal Financial Revenue and Expenditure Budget for 1954.
