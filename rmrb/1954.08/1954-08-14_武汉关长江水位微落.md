    Wuhan Customs Yangtze River Water Level Slightly Drops
    The Yangtze River water level at Wuhan Customs has slightly dropped by two centimeters from 1:00 AM to 10:00 PM on the 13th. From August 2nd, the Yangtze River water level at Wuhan Customs had been rising daily for the past eleven days, reaching 29.59 meters at 12:00 AM on the 12th. It dropped by one centimeter at 1:00 AM on the 13th, to 29.58 meters, and then to 29.57 meters from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM, still 1.29 meters higher than the highest water level in previous years. On the 13th, the water level of the Han River below Laohekou and the Yangtze River from Qingxichang in Sichuan to Nanjing was falling. In Huangshi City, the water level had dropped from 26.19 meters on the 12th to 26.09 meters by the afternoon of the 13th. The water level at Shashi had dropped to 43.19 meters by 11:00 AM on the 13th. However, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the upper reaches of the Han River, and the Min River and Jialing River are currently experiencing rising water levels again.

    The responsible persons of the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters and the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission jointly inspected the dike conditions along Zhanggong Dike and the dikes along the Yangtze River and Han River in Hankou on the 12th and 13th mornings. They promptly addressed issues related to dike heightening, reinforcement, and emergency repairs, and encouraged the city's flood control teams to continue fighting under the current exceptionally high water levels. They urged them to unremittingly continue heightening and reinforcing the dikes, and to tirelessly prepare for emergency repairs, especially for major emergencies.

    For more than ten days, Wuhan has experienced sunny weather. After repeated heightening and reinforcement, the city's dikes have consistently remained 50 centimeters to 1 meter higher than the water surface, despite the water level rising 28.7 centimeters in the past eleven days.

    武汉关长江水位微落
    武汉关长江水位从十三日晨一时起到下午十时已微落二公分。自八月二日起，过去十一天武汉关长江水位每天都在上涨，到十二日晚十二时曾涨到二九点五九公尺，到十三日晨一时下落一公分，为二九点五八公尺，晨七时到下午十时落到二九点五七公尺，比历年最高水位仍高出一点二九公尺。十三日汉水从老河口以下，长江从四川清溪场以下一直到南京水位都在下落。黄石市从十二日到十三日下午水位已由二六点一九公尺落到二六点零九公尺。沙市水位到十三日上午十一时已落到四三点一九公尺。但目前长江上游、汉水上游和岷江、嘉陵江又有涨势。
    武汉市防汛总指挥部和长江水利委员会的负责人在十二日和十三日上午一同到张公堤和汉口沿江沿河堤上沿堤检查了堤防情况，及时处理有关堤防加高加固和抢险的问题，并鼓励全市防汛队伍在当前异常高的水位下持续战斗，不间歇地把堤防继续加高加固，不懈地进行抢险特别是抢大险的准备。
    武汉十多天来，一直天晴。全市堤防经过一再加高加固，十一天来虽涨水八公寸七公分，但始终比水面高出五公寸到一公尺左右。
