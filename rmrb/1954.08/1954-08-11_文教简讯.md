    Education and Culture Briefs
    The Jishou National Middle School in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region of Hunan Province enrolled 300 new students this autumn, including 113 Miao students. When the school was established in 1952, there were only 60 Miao students among the 380 students in the school. After the autumn semester begins this year, Miao students will account for one-third of the total number of students. Jishou National Middle School is a well-equipped school in the autonomous region. In the past two years, it has built new teaching buildings, dormitories, libraries, and added physics and chemistry laboratories. Miao students enjoy scholarships at the school.
    In the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province, the number of school-age children from various ethnic groups is gradually increasing. This year, there are 8,247 primary school students and 114 middle school students in the region, an increase of approximately two times compared to 1951. Currently, there are 128 middle and primary schools in the region. Primary schools have been established in some areas inhabited by the Hani and Yi ethnic groups where schools had never been established historically. To meet the enrollment demands of children from various ethnic groups, the Autonomous Region People's Government will add more than 30 primary schools in remote areas this autumn and will establish a national middle school in Yuanyang County, the capital of the autonomous region.

    文教简讯
    湖南省湘西苗族自治区吉首民族中学今年秋季招生，共录取新生三百名，其中有一百一十三名苗族学生。一九五二年这所学校成立时，全校三百八十名学生中，只有六十个苗族学生。今年秋季开学后，苗族学生将占学生总数的三分之一。吉首民族中学是自治区一所设备完善的学校，两年来新建了教学大楼、宿舍、图书室并增设了理化实验室等，苗族学生在学校里都享有助学金待遇。
    云南省红河哈尼族自治区各族入学儿童逐渐增多。今年全区有小学生八千二百四十七人，中学生一百十四人，学生人数比一九五一年增加约二倍。现在，全区已有一百二十八所中、小学校，有些历史上从来没有设过学校的哈尼族、彝族聚居的地方，都已建立了小学校。为了适应各族儿童的入学要求，自治区人民政府今年秋季将在边远地区增设小学校三十多所，并将在自治区首府元阳县创办一所民族中学。　（新华社）
