Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The French people's movement against the revival of German militarism and in support of establishing a European collective security system is intensifying.

Democratic newspapers report that French Prime Minister Mendès France, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Secretariat of the National Assembly, and members of parliament have received numerous letters, telegrams, and resolutions demanding the rejection of the Paris Military Treaty and the Bonn Military Treaty, which threaten France's security and independence.

Throughout France, signatures are being collected for petitions against the ratification of the Paris Treaty. People are handing these petitions to the members of parliament elected in their constituencies.

The Peace Committee of the Seine region wrote to Mendès France, representing three million residents of the Seine region from all walks of life and holding various political views and religious beliefs, demanding the rejection of the "European Army" treaty and advocating for negotiations on collective security issues. Residents of Goussonville in the Seine-et-Oise region, in a letter to Mendès France, protested the ratification of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, and opposed any amendments that would facilitate the revival of West German militarism.

Many French enterprises have held meetings of various sizes, where working people expressed their determination to continue opposing the establishment of the "European Defense Community."

    [Xinhua News Agency, August 19th Dispatch] TASS, Paris: French Prime Minister Mendès France left for Brussels on the 18th to attend a meeting of the six Western European nations (France, Italy, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) on the 19th to discuss the "European Defense Community" issue. The meeting will discuss the French government's proposed amendments to the "European Defense Community" treaty, which France has signed but not yet ratified.

    The "European Defense Community" treaty is to be submitted to the French National Assembly for debate at the end of this month. This treaty stipulates the remilitarization of West Germany, rebuilding its military forces to serve the American imperialists. Despite strong pressure from the United States and Bonn, the French government has hesitated to put the ratification of this treaty on the parliamentary agenda, because the plan to arm West Germany and establish the "European Defense Community" has met with the broadest and strongest opposition in France.

    Mendès France recognizes that it is impossible for the French parliament to ratify the "European Defense Community" treaty in its current form, and he has drafted some "amendments." He hopes that if the other member states of the group agree to these amendments, some of those in France who oppose the treaty can be dissuaded from their opposition, thereby creating divisions among the treaty's opponents.

    Mendès France's proposals have not yet been formally published, but, according to newspaper reports, his "amendments" do not affect the essence of the treaty.

    Mendès France's proposals have been submitted in advance to the governments of the other five countries concerned. It is said that these proposals have caused "dissatisfaction" among some people in countries that have already ratified the treaty in their parliaments. An Agence France-Presse dispatch stated: "Abroad, there is condemnation of the French Prime Minister for taking an attitude against the establishment of the European Defense Community, and some even accuse him of wanting to obstruct the establishment of the European Army." Agence France-Presse said that these accusations are unfounded. It pointed out that when the French government adopted the French Prime Minister's
  "compromise proposals," the ministers who opposed the treaty resigned, while the supporters of the treaty supported these proposals.

    Agence France-Presse pointed out that the French Prime Minister's "compromise" proposals "do not involve the substance of the treaty."

    The right-wing "Le Figaro" also believes that the proposals that the French government will submit to the Brussels meeting "do not change the substance of the European Army treaty." The newspaper said that these proposals help to create the conditions "necessary for the French parliament to ratify the (European Defense Community) treaty."

    法国人民强烈反对巴黎条约和波恩条约
    据新华社讯：法国人民反对复活德国军国主义、拥护建立欧洲集体安全体系的运动日益加强。
    民主报纸报道：法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯、外交部、国民议会秘书处和议员们都收到很多信件、电报和决议，这些文件要求拒绝威胁法国的安全和独立的巴黎军事条约和波恩军事条约。
    法国全国各地在为反对批准巴黎条约的请愿书征集签名。人们把这些请愿书交给他们本选区选出的议员。
    塞纳省的和平委员会写信给孟戴斯—弗朗斯，它代表属于各阶层、抱着各种政治观点和宗教信仰的三百万塞纳省居民要求拒绝“欧洲军”条约，主张就集体安全问题进行谈判。塞纳—瓦斯省古塞维的居民在写给孟戴斯—弗朗斯的信中抗议批准波恩条约和巴黎条约，并且反对会促成西德军国主义复活的任何修正案。
    法国许多企业都曾举行大小集会，劳动人民在会上表示决心继续反对建立“欧洲防务集团”。
      【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯在十八日动身到布鲁塞尔去，出席在十九日举行的西欧六国（法、意、西德、荷、比、卢）讨论“欧洲防务集团”问题的会议。会议要讨论法国政府对法国已经签字但还没有批准的“欧洲防务集团”条约的若干修正建议。
       “欧洲防务集团”条约要在本月底提交法国国民议会辩论，这个条约规定让西德重新军国主义化，重建它的军事力量以便为美帝国主义分子效劳。法国政府尽管受到美国和波恩的强大压力，却一直犹豫不定，不敢把批准这个条约的问题列入议会议程，因为武装西德和成立“欧洲防务集团”的计划在法国遭到了最广泛和最强烈的反对。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯认识到要法国议会批准现有形式的“欧洲防务集团”条约是不可能的，他拟出了若干“修正”。他希望：如果这个集团的其他成员国同意了这些修正，就可以使法国反对这个条约的某些人打消他们的反对意见，这样，条约的反对者中间就会发生分裂。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯的建议还没有正式发表，但是，从报纸消息看来，他的“修正”并不影响条约的实质。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯的建议已经事先提交给有关的其他五国政府。据说这些建议使得那些已经在议会中批准了条约的国家的某些人士感到“不满”。法新社的一条电讯说：“国外都在谴责法国总理采取了反对成立欧洲防务集团的态度，甚至有些人指责他想阻挠欧洲军的成立。”法新社说，这些指责是没有理由的。它指出：在法国政府通过法国总理的
  “折衷建议”时，反对这个条约的部长们辞职了，而条约的拥护者却支持这些建议。
    法新社指出：法国总理的“折衷”建议“并没有涉及条约的实质”。
    右翼的“费加罗报”也认为法国政府要提交布鲁塞尔会议的建议“并没有改变欧洲军条约的实质。”这家报纸说，这些建议有助于创造“法国议会批准（“欧洲防务集团”）条约所必需的”条件。
