The large-scale water and soil conservation project in Pingliang Prefecture, Gansu Province – the Zhifanggou sediment retention dam in the suburbs of Pingliang City – officially commenced construction in late June.

This project is one of the projects to control the Yellow River's water hazards and is also an important project to protect Pingliang city and suburban farmland from flood damage. In past years, whenever there was a major rainstorm, floodwaters from the area of nearly twenty square kilometers above Zhifanggou near Pingliang City would overflow from the Zhifanggou riverbed into parts of the city and submerge many farmlands in the suburbs. Then, carrying large amounts of sediment, the water would flow into the Yellow River via the Jing River, becoming a factor in the Yellow River's water hazards.

After the completion of the Zhifanggou sediment retention dam project, it can store more than 1.6 million cubic meters of water. After the floodwaters are intercepted by the dam and properly discharged through culverts and other structures, it can prevent the floodwaters carrying large amounts of sediment from the mountains near Zhifanggou from flowing into the Yellow River via the Jing River.

In addition to the large amount of soil needed for the dam and some stone and sand, the culvert and spillway projects of this sediment retention dam project are almost entirely constructed with cement and stonework. In the culvert project, there is a 118-meter horizontal tunnel that must be dug through the mountain and needs to be constructed with stone and cement into a horseshoe-shaped tunnel with a diameter of 1.3 meters. Preliminary estimates indicate that the entire project will require a total of 168,000 workdays and can be completed before the rainy season in May 1955.

### 平凉纸坊沟留淤坝工程开工

    平凉纸坊沟留淤坝工程开工
    甘肃省平凉专区大型的水土保持工程——平凉市郊纸坊沟留淤土坝，已于六月下旬正式动工。
    这一工程，是根治黄河水患的工程之一；也是保障平凉市区及郊区农田减轻洪水危害的重要工程之一。历年来，每遇最大暴雨，平凉市纸坊沟附近山上方圆近二十平方公里面积的洪水，就会从纸坊沟河道溢入部分市区和淹没郊区许多农田；然后带有大量泥沙，由泾河再流入黄河，成为黄河水患的因素之一。
    纸坊沟留淤土坝工程修成后，可以蓄水一百六十多万立方公尺。洪水经过土坝的拦蓄和泄水涵洞等的适当排泄，就可以防止纸坊沟附近山上的带有大量泥沙的洪水由泾河流入黄河。
    这一留淤土坝工程，除土坝需要大量泥土和一部分石、沙以外，泄水涵洞和溢洪道工程，几乎大部都用的水泥和石砌。泄水涵洞工程中，有一百一十八公尺的横洞，还必须从山中挖洞通过；并需要用石头和水泥修成直径一点三公尺的马蹄形洞管。初步估计，全部工程共需工十六万八千个，到一九五五年五月雨季前可以竣工。
