    People's Representative Mr. Xu Lihua Talks About Democracy
    Song Bingyao
    In early July this year, during the first session of the First People's Congress of Qiqihar City, Mr. Xu Lihua, a city People's Representative, Deputy Director of the Provincial Health Workers Association, and an elderly gentleman, shared his thoughts on democracy based on his rich life experiences.
    The publication of the draft constitution evoked infinite感慨 from Mr. Xu Lihua. Recalling the dark days of the past, he said: "As far back as the Qing Dynasty, China suffered from imperialist aggression. The people hoped that the country would become strong and not be bullied by imperialists, and they demanded that the Qing government implement a constitution. The Empress Dowager Cixi, fearing a mass uprising, agreed on the one hand and killed many people on the other. At that time, there was no question of the people having any rights! The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing government, and Yuan Shikai became the President. Internally, he used force to suppress the people and bribed officials with money. Anyone who supported him as emperor could be given official titles and money. Externally, he betrayed the country and signed the Twenty-One Demands with the Japanese aggressors, which was simply selling China to them! At that time, the people hated Yuan Shikai very much, but they dared not speak out. Later, Yuan Shikai became emperor, calling himself 'Hongxian,' and collapsed in less than a hundred days. In those days, the people were slaves, not masters, and there was no question of democracy."
    The old gentleman talked about the so-called "democratic elections" at that time: Elections were subject to various restrictions, and women had no right to vote or be elected. One had to spend money to get elected; even a county councilor could not be elected without a large sum of money. However, some people spent money anyway, because it was a profitable business. Those elected were all bureaucrats, bullies, landlords, local tyrants, and evil gentry, with not a single worker or farmer. Electing provincial and central congressmen was the same as electing county councilors, except that it cost more money. When I was studying at Peking Union Medical College, I had the opportunity to attend a meeting of the Beijing Senate as an observer. The meeting had not been going on for twenty minutes when people started cursing on this side, and copper ink boxes flew over from that side. Originally a one-hour meeting, it took four hours of cursing and fighting because the price had not been agreed upon in advance. As for the army, police, courts, etc., they were all tools for oppressing the people. There was even less talk of democracy during the rule of the enemy, puppets, and the Kuomintang. The people were only enslaved, suffering from poverty and death.
    Mr. Xu Lihua spoke excitedly and happily about the publication of the draft constitution. He said: "Speaking for myself, something I have been looking forward to for decades has been realized under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The draft constitution stipulates that all power belongs to the people, which means that the people are the masters of the country. The process of drafting the constitution also fully demonstrates the democracy of our country.
    "I am an ophthalmologist and am already sixty years old, but the Communist Party and the People's Government value me very much. In 1950, I was specially invited to participate in the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Representative Conference as a representative. Frankly speaking, at first I doubted whether the people had the say in government affairs, but later the facts proved that this was indeed the case. Not only were correct opinions accepted by the government, but even if some representatives said something wrong, the government listened patiently and explained it. This is truly a full manifestation of democracy. The government's budget, final accounts, work plans, work summaries, etc., are all openly discussed at the People's Representative Conference. Such things were impossible in the past. Did the people dare to offer opinions to the government in the old society? Now the people can make suggestions to the government at any time and can also offer criticisms. Let me give a small example: For the sake of environmental sanitation in Qiqihar City, we suggested that the government build public toilets and that horse-drawn carriages should have manure bags; in order to strengthen the study of traditional Chinese medicine, we suggested that the government establish a training class for traditional Chinese medicine. These suggestions have been adopted and successfully implemented by the government. At a People's Representative Conference, I criticized a cadre of the Municipal People's Government Health Department. He was swayed by others and caused disunity between Western and traditional Chinese medicine. After investigation, the government found this to be true and immediately educated him and transferred him from his original job. Later, this cadre changed for the better and worked actively and responsibly. These facts truly show that in our country, the people are the true masters, and all power belongs to the people. The country's army, police, courts, etc., also protect the interests of the people, and they are the tools of our people's democratic dictatorship. Therefore, we should love our country, cherish our rights, abide by our obligations, and actively participate in the construction of our country, so that our country can steadily move towards a socialist society!"

    人民代表许理华老先生谈民主
    宋秉尧
    今年七月上旬，在齐齐哈尔市第一届第一次人民代表大会会议期间，市人民代表、省卫生工作者协会副主任、年迈的许理华老先生以丰富的生活经历，发表了对于民主的感想。
    宪法草案的公布，引起了许理华老先生的无限感慨。他回忆过去的黑暗年代说：“远在满清时代，中国受着帝国主义的侵略，老百姓希望国家富强，不受帝国主义欺负，纷纷要求满清政府实行立宪。西太后怕群众起来革命，一面答应，一面把老百姓杀了许多。那时候根本谈不到人民有什么权利！辛亥革命推翻了满清政府，袁世凯当上了大总统，他对内一面用武力压迫人民，一面用钱收买官吏，只要拥护他当皇帝就可以封官给钱；对外就卖国，和日本侵略者签订了二十一条，这简直就是把中国卖给人家啦！当时老百姓非常痛恨袁世凯，但是敢怒不敢言。以后袁世凯当上皇帝，号称‘洪宪’，不到一百天就垮台了。在那些年代，人民是奴才不是主人，根本谈不到什么民主。”
    老先生谈起了当时的所谓“民主选举”：那时候选举要受到种种限制，妇女更没有选举权和被选举权。当选都得花钱买，就是个县议员，没大批银元也当不上。可是有的人花钱也干，因为这是一本万利，当上议员就可以升官发财。所以当选的人都是官僚、恶霸、地主、土豪、劣绅，没有一个工人，也没有一个农民。当选省议员、中央议员也和县议员一样，不同的就是花钱更多。我在北京协和医科大学念书的时候，有机会列席了一次北京参议院的会议。会议没开到二十分钟这边就骂上啦，那边铜墨盒子就飞过来了。本来一个钟头的会，由于事先没讲好价钱，连骂带打四个钟头也没开完。至于军队、警察、法庭等，也都是压迫人民的工具。敌伪和国民党统治时代更谈不到什么民主了，人民只有被奴役，遭受贫困和死亡。
    许理华老先生兴奋愉快地谈起宪法草案的公布。他说：“以我个人来说，盼望了好几十年的事，在共产党、毛主席的领导下已经实现了。宪法草案规定了一切权力属于人民，这就是说人民是国家的主人。从宪法草案的制定过程也可以充分看出我们国家的民主。
    “我是眼科医生，已经六十岁啦，可是共产党、人民政府非常重视我，一九五零年就特邀我为代表参加黑龙江省人民代表会议。坦白地说，起初我怀疑政府的事情是否人民说了算，以后事实证明确实是这样，不但正确的意见，人民说了政府接受，就是有的代表说的不对，政府也耐心地听取，加以解释，真是充分发扬民主。政府的预算、决算、工作计划、工作总结等都在人民代表会议上公开讨论，这样的事情是过去根本谈不到的。旧社会里老百姓敢向政府提意见吗？现在人民可以随时向政府建议，还可以提出批评。我举一个小例子吧：为了齐齐哈尔市环境卫生，我们建议政府修公共厕所，马车要带粪兜；为了加强中医学习，建议政府成立中医进修班。这些建议都被政府采纳并完满地实现了。我在一次人民代表会议上，批评了市人民政府卫生科的一个干部，他受人的拉拢，造成西医和中医不团结，政府调查属实后，马上对他进行教育，并把他调离了原来的工作。以后这个干部转变好了，工作积极负责。这些事实，千真万确地说明了在我们国家里人民是真正的主人，一切权力是属于人民的。国家的军队、警察、法院等，也是保护人民利益的，它是我们人民民主专政的工具。所以我们应该热爱我们的国家，珍重权利，遵守义务，积极参加我们国家的建设事业，使我们国家稳步地走向社会主义社会！”
