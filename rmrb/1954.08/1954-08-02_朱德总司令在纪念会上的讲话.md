Comrades,

    Today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country are celebrating the 27th anniversary of the founding of our army.

    As we greet this glorious festival this year, our people are welcoming their first constitution and the upcoming National People's Congress, and are working and struggling heroically with full confidence to build our country into a great socialist nation. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, together with the people of the whole country, feel infinitely excited about the bright future of their motherland.

    As we greet this glorious festival this year, peace-loving people all over the world, following the realization of the Korean armistice, have also striven for an agreement on the Indochina peace issue. This is the result of the long-term and arduous struggle of the people and armies of the three Indochinese countries, and the result of the efforts of peace-loving people all over the world. This is another major victory for peace over war. This proves once again that all international disputes can be resolved through peaceful negotiation.

    As we greet this glorious "August 1st" festival this year, we will never forget that Taiwan, our country's inseparable and sacred territory, has not yet been liberated. At present, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is still entrenched in Taiwan, continuing to betray the country, selling out the rights and interests of the Chinese people and the Taiwan compatriots to American imperialism, intensifying harassment of our coastal areas and islands, massacring people, robbing fishermen, seizing fishing boats, and dispatching and air-dropping special agents to sneak into our mainland to carry out sabotage activities, implementing a policy of harming overseas Chinese, deceiving overseas Chinese youth into becoming Chiang bandit cannon fodder, plundering overseas Chinese property, and robbing and detaining merchant ships of various countries trading with our country. This series of bandit behaviors by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is aimed at attempting to restore the old order in China.

    The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has long been spurned by the Chinese people and is already exhausted. The reason why it can continue to be entrenched in Taiwan and continue to do evil is because it still has the protection of American imperialism. After its failures on the Korean battlefield and at the Geneva Conference, American imperialism is now stepping up its efforts to use the Chiang Kai-shek remnants entrenched in Taiwan to continue to plot to invade our country and subvert our people's regime. The American war-mongering group is now attempting to further conclude a so-called "bilateral common security treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitor, attempting to permanently turn Taiwan, our country's territory, into an American colony and a military springboard for invading our mainland in the form of a treaty, and to organize a so-called "Pacific anti-communist military group" including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan, in order to realize its sinister plot of having Asians fight Asians. The United States has always stubbornly stuffed the Chiang bandit representative into the Chinese seat in the United Nations, depriving the People's Republic of China of its legitimate status in the United Nations. The United States continues to supply the Chiang bandits with airplanes and warships, and sends a large military delegation to train the remnants of the Chiang bandit army. The United States instigates and supports the remnant Chiang bandits to engage in piracy. American warships and airplanes have also brazenly and repeatedly intruded into our country's airspace and territorial waters to provoke incidents. The incident on July 26, when American airplanes intruded into the airspace over Yulin Port and Lehui, Hainan Island, and attacked our patrol planes, shooting down two of our patrol planes, is the most recent direct armed provocation by American imperialism against our country. This series of aggressive crimes by American imperialism seriously threatens our country's security and peace in Asia and the world, which is intolerable to all Chinese people and peace-loving people around the world.

    Comrades: Taiwan has been our country's territory since ancient times, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. The compatriots in Taiwan are still suffering in dire straits. Unless the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is completely eliminated and Taiwan is liberated, our task of liberating all of China has not been completed. As long as Taiwan is not liberated, the people of the whole country, especially the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, will not have washed away the shame on their bodies, and we will have nothing to be proud of. Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is our country's internal affair, and no other country is allowed to interfere. Our people must unite as one and resolutely struggle to liberate Taiwan and return the Taiwan people to the embrace of the motherland, and resolutely struggle for the complete unification of the motherland and the complete victory of the cause of people's liberation.

    In order to accomplish this sacred mission, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces must strengthen political and military training, master the weapons in their hands and the coordinated operations of various arms, accelerate the modernization of national defense, raise vigilance, always maintain combat readiness, fight heroically on the front lines, and strive to liberate Taiwan and defend the motherland. The people of the whole country must strengthen unity, work actively, strive for production, practice thrift, and realize the country's socialist industrialization, in order to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

    The Chinese people love peace. We need a peaceful environment to build our country. We will continue to work with peace-loving people all over the world to resolve the Korean issue peacefully and to ensure and strive for the implementation of the agreement on the Indochina peace issue. Our policy of establishing and developing diplomatic relations with any country based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty has achieved success, and will continue to be a principle that our country consistently adheres to in the future.

    We firmly believe that our cause is just. We will gain the sympathy and support of people all over the world. We must build our country into a great socialist country. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, the People's Liberation Army will surely be able to gloriously complete the great task of liberating Taiwan and defending the motherland.

    Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the organizer and leader of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong!

### 朱德总司令在纪念会上的讲话

    朱德总司令在纪念会上的讲话同志们：
    今天，中国人民解放军和全国人民一道庆祝我军建军二十七周年。
    当我们今年迎接这个光荣节日的时候，我国人民正在迎接自己的第一个宪法和即将召开的全国人民代表大会会议，正在满怀信心地为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家进行着英勇的劳动和斗争。中国人民解放军和全国人民一起，为自己祖国的光明前途感到无限兴奋。
    当我们今年迎接这个光荣节日的时候，全世界爱好和平的人民，继朝鲜停战实现之后又争取到了印度支那和平问题达成协议。这是印度支那三国人民及其军队长期艰苦奋斗的结果，是全世界爱好和平人民努力奋斗的结果。这是和平战胜战争的又一次重大胜利。这再次证明了一切国际纠纷是可以经过和平协商的方法获得解决的。
    当我们今年迎接“八一”这个光荣节日的时候，我们绝对不会忘记我国不可分割的神圣领土——台湾还没有解放。目前，蒋介石匪帮还盘踞在台湾，继续卖国，把中国人民和台湾同胞的权益出卖给美帝国主义，加紧骚扰我国沿海地区和岛屿，屠杀人民，抢劫渔民，劫夺渔船，派遣和空降特务潜入我国大陆进行破坏活动，实行祸侨政策，欺骗华侨青年去当蒋匪炮灰，掠夺华侨财产，打劫和扣留各国与我国通商的商船。蒋介石匪帮的这一连串盗匪行为，其目的是企图在中国实行复辟。
    蒋介石匪帮早已为中国人民所唾弃，早已势穷力竭，它所以能够继续盘踞台湾，继续作恶，是由于它还有美国帝国主义的庇护。美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上和在日内瓦会议上失败之后，现正加紧利用盘踞台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮，继续阴谋侵犯我国，颠覆我国人民政权。美国的好战集团现在正企图更进一步与蒋介石卖国贼订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”，企图以条约形式把我国领土台湾永远变为美国的殖民地和侵略我国大陆的军事跳板，并组织包括日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾、泰国和台湾蒋匪在内的所谓“太平洋反共军事集团”，以实现其亚洲人打亚洲人的罪恶阴谋。美国一直硬把蒋匪代表塞在联合国中的中国席位上，剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位。美国不断地供给蒋匪飞机和军舰，派遣庞大的军事代表团训练残余的蒋匪军。美国嗾使和支持残余蒋匪从事海盗活动。美国军舰和飞机还悍然屡次侵入我国领空和领海寻衅。七月二十六日美国飞机侵入我海南岛榆林港和乐会上空，向我巡逻飞机攻击，并将我两架巡逻飞机击落的事件，就是最近发生的美国帝国主义仇视我国的直接武装挑衅。美帝国主义这一系列的侵略罪行，严重地威胁了我国的安全和亚洲及世界和平，这是全中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民所不能容忍的。
    同志们：台湾自古以来就是我国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。台湾的同胞还在水深火热中受着苦难。不彻底消灭蒋介石匪帮，不把台湾解放，我们解放全中国的任务就还没有完成。台湾一天不解放，我们全国人民，首先是人民解放军指战员，就一天没有洗清自己身上的耻辱，我们更没有什么值得骄傲的地方。解放台湾，消灭蒋介石残余匪帮，这是我国的内政，绝不容许别国来干涉。我国人民必须万众一心，为解放台湾、使台湾人民重归祖国怀抱而坚决奋斗，为祖国的完全统一和人民解放事业的彻底胜利而坚决奋斗。
    为了完成这一神圣任务，中国人民解放军陆、海、空军全体指挥员、战斗员必须加强政治、军事训练，熟练手中武器和诸兵种协同作战，加速国防现代化的建设，提高警惕性，经常保持战斗准备，在前线英勇作战，为解放台湾、保卫祖国而奋斗。全国人民要加强团结，积极工作，努力生产，厉行节约，实现国家的社会主义工业化，以支持中国人民解放军解放台湾。
    中国人民是热爱和平的。我们需要和平的环境来建设我们的国家。我们将和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，继续为和平解决朝鲜问题而努力，为保证与争取印度支那和平问题协议的实现而努力。我们根据平等、互利、互相尊重领土主权的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系的政策已经获得成就，今后仍将是我国始终如一地遵守的原则。
    我们坚信，我们的事业是正义的。我们将获得全世界人民的同情和拥护。我们一定要把祖国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家。人民解放军在中国共产党的领导下，在全国人民的支援下，一定能够光荣地完成解放台湾、保卫祖国的伟大任务。
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民解放军的组织者和领导者中国共产党和毛泽东主席万岁！
