    The Moscow newspapers published the Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR on Continuing to Reclaim Virgin and Fallow Land to Increase Grain Production.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR noted with satisfaction that the call of the Party and the Government to reclaim millions of hectares of previously unutilized virgin and fallow land to increase grain production in the Soviet Union has received a warm response and the support of the people of the whole country. In a short period, Party organizations, Soviet organs, and agricultural organs at all levels, male and female members of collective farms, staff members of machine tractor stations and state farms, and workers in industry and transportation have carried out immense work in reclaiming virgin and fallow land, ensuring the supply of machines, equipment, spare parts, seeds, and other necessary materials to the reclamation areas for machine tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms. One hundred and twenty-four new large-scale grain state farms equipped with modern agricultural machinery have been established on virgin and fallow land. More than 150,000 skilled workers, engineers, technicians, agronomists, and other agricultural experts from industrial departments, machine tractor stations, and state farms have voluntarily gone to the countryside and actively participated in the work of reclaiming virgin and fallow land.
    In the spring of 1954, 3.6 million hectares (15 mu per hectare) of wheat and other grains were sown on the newly reclaimed land, while the plan only stipulated 2.3 million hectares. Collective farms completed 156 percent of the grain sowing plan on virgin and fallow land, and state farms completed 176 percent.
    Due to the various measures taken, the total grain harvest in Western Siberia and the Kazakh Republic this year will greatly increase from the grain sown on the newly reclaimed virgin and fallow land. By August 10th of this year, 13.4 million hectares of virgin and fallow land had been reclaimed, reaching 103.2 percent of the plan. Machine tractor stations and collective farms in Omsk, Akmolinsk, Novosibirsk, Chkalov, Kurghan, Pavlodar, Tyumen, Kokchetav, Karaganda, Chelyabinsk, Chita, Aktyubinsk, North Kazakhstan, Irkutsk, Saratov, and other states and the Bashkir Autonomous Republic, as well as state farms in Stalingrad, Rostov, Chelyabinsk, and other states, and the Stavropol and Krasnoyarsk Territories, have overfulfilled the plan for reclaiming virgin and fallow land. In addition, some states in the Russian Federation and the Kazakh Republic did not have the task of reclaiming virgin and fallow land, but the machine tractor stations and collective farms there had also reclaimed 619,000 hectares of wasteland by August 10th. Among them, the collective farms in Amur State reclaimed 161,000 hectares, the collective farms in Stalingrad State reclaimed 129,000 hectares, and the collective farms in the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republic reclaimed 104,000 hectares. By August 10th of this year, the collective farms and state farms across the Soviet Union had reclaimed 14.1 million hectares of very fertile virgin and fallow land. At present, machine tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms in various regions are still continuing to reclaim virgin and fallow land in preparation for sowing in 1955.
   The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR consider the achievements made this year in the reclamation of virgin and fallow land in regions such as Kazakhstan, Siberia, and the Urals, to be only the beginning of the nationwide task of reclaiming unutilized fertile land to increase grain production in the Soviet Union. The task of reclaiming 13 million hectares of virgin and fallow land in 1954 has by no means exhausted the enormous potential that our country possesses to further expand the grain sowing area of collective farms and state farms, and to greatly increase grain production with minimal labor and material consumption.
    The Soviet state possesses all the conditions to rapidly reclaim large amounts of virgin and fallow land. In our country's agriculture, there is now a skilled army of workers and experts, and our industry is able to meet the needs of machine tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms for tractors, combine harvesters, automobiles, agricultural machinery, and other equipment and materials.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR decided:
    (1) That the reclamation of wasteland and the making of new land produce economic value by collective farms and state farms is a great contribution to the national cause of increasing food production. This cause is fully in line with the interests of the collective farms and collective farm members, because it helps to rapidly develop production in all sectors of agriculture, ensures the supply of feed for livestock, and greatly increases the economic income of collective farms and the physical and monetary income of collective farm members.
    It is precisely because of this that collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms overfulfilled the plan for sowing grain on virgin and fallow land this spring, and are now victoriously completing and overfulfilling the task of reclaiming virgin and fallow land for sowing in 1955.
    Based on the experience of reclaiming wasteland in 1954, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR believe that it is possible to further increase the national grain production by means of additional reclamation of virgin and fallow land. Therefore, it calls on collective farm members, staff members of machine tractor stations and state farms, local Party organizations, local Soviet organs, and agricultural organs to greatly overfulfill the stipulated land reclamation tasks in 1954, in order to ensure that in 1955, exceeding the original plan of 13 million hectares, at least 15 million hectares of newly reclaimed land can be sown with grain and other crops.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR believe that, based on the experience of reclaiming wasteland in the spring of 1954 and on the full utilization of machinery, the collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms in our country's eastern regions can, in the spring of 1955, in addition to sowing seeds on the fallow and autumn-plowed land reclaimed in 1954, also reclaim large areas of wasteland for sowing grain and other crops. To further expand the sowing area of grain and other crops, and to increase grain production by reclaiming wasteland, so that in 1956 the newly reclaimed sowing area of grain and other crops reaches 28 to 30 million hectares, is the most important task of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the Soviet Ministry of State Farms, the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, and the Party organizations, Soviet organs, and agricultural organs in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River Basin, the North Caucasus, and other regions of the country.
    The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the Soviet Ministry of State Farms, the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, and the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh Republic should do everything possible to help local Party organizations, local Soviet organs, and agricultural organs, as well as machine tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms, organize the utilization and reclamation of virgin and fallow land in preparation for sowing in 1955 and 1956, and should widely publicize and promote the experience of advanced collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms in reclaiming wasteland and increasing grain yield per unit area on the newly reclaimed wasteland.
    (2) Due to the great possibility of continuing to reclaim wasteland, and the need to fully mechanize the work of planting crops on these fields, the Soviet State Planning Committee, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the Soviet Ministry of State Farms, the Soviet Ministry of Procurement, and the Soviet Ministry of Automobile, Tractor, and Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing, should put forward suggestions on how to ensure the supply of sufficient tractors, combine harvesters, other agricultural machinery, automobiles, equipment, materials, and prefabricated houses to the machine tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms in the reclamation areas, and how to build granaries, warehouses, roads, and railway branch lines.
    (3) In the Siberian and Kazakh regions, the further reclamation of virgin and fallow land will mainly be done by establishing state farms. Therefore, the Soviet Ministry of State Farms, the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, and the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh Republic should formulate measures to establish grain state farms in these regions and to provide them with material and technical guarantees.
    (4) It is suggested that the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the Soviet Ministry of State Farms, the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh Republic, as well as the local Party organizations, local Soviet organs, and agricultural organs in the reclamation areas, strengthen their attention to the construction of housing and material welfare facilities for the workers and experts participating in the reclamation work, overcome the shortcomings existing in this area, and for this purpose, widely organize the construction of housing and buildings for cultural and welfare institutions in machine tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms, and do their best to encourage the staff of machine tractor stations and state farms to build private housing.
    The Soviet Ministry of Trade, the Central Union of Soviet Cooperatives, and their local institutions, should take measures to improve the work of trade organizations in the reclamation areas, ensure the uninterrupted supply of industrial products and food to the staff of machine tractor stations and state farms in these areas, and open a sufficient number of canteens, teahouses, small shops, stores, tailoring shops, and repair shops for them.
    The Soviet Ministry of Health, the Soviet Ministry of Culture, and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should establish a sufficient number of hospitals, clinics, medical stations, libraries, radio stations, film stations, and post and telecommunications branches in the reclamation areas.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR attach particular importance to strengthening the machine tractor stations and state farms reclaiming wasteland with cadres such as mechanics, engineers, technicians, agronomists, and leading staff, and are deeply convinced that, if needed, tens of thousands of skilled workers, agronomists, engineers, and technicians, especially our Soviet youth, will, as in the spring of this year, warmly respond to the call and voluntarily participate in the reclamation work.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR call on Party organizations, trade union organizations, and organizations of the Lenin Communist Youth League at all levels, as well as all collective farm members, staff members of machine tractor stations and state farms, and workers of industrial enterprises and the transportation industry to widely launch socialist competition, strive to complete the above-mentioned newly added nationwide task of reclaiming wasteland as soon as possible, continuously supply agriculture with tractors, agricultural machinery, spare parts, fuel, equipment, and other industrial products, and promptly send these machines and materials to the reclamation areas.

    苏共中央和苏联部长会议发布
    关于继续开垦生荒地和熟荒地以增加谷物生产的决议
    莫斯科各报公布了苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议关于继续开垦生荒地和熟荒地以增加谷物生产的决议。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议满意地指出，党和政府关于开垦以前没有利用的无数百万公顷生荒地和熟荒地以增加苏联的谷物生产的号召，得到了热烈的响应和全国人民的拥护。在短短的时期内，各级党组织，苏维埃机关和农业机关，集体农庄男女庄员，机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员，工业和运输业的工人已进行了巨大的开垦生荒地和熟荒地的工作，保证供给各开垦地区的机器拖拉机站、集体农庄、国营农场以机器、装备、备件、种子及其他必需的物资。在生荒地和熟荒地上建立了一百二十四个用现代农业机器装备起来的新的大型谷物国营农场。十五万以上工业部门、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的熟练工人、工程师、技术员、农艺师和其他农业专家自愿下乡并积极地参加了开垦生荒地和熟荒地的工作。
    一九五四年春天，在新开垦的土地上播种了三百六十万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）小麦和其他谷物，而计划只规定二百三十万公顷。集体农庄完成了在生荒地和熟荒地上谷物播种计划的百分之一百五十六，国营农场完成了百分之一百七十六。
    由于采取了种种措施，在新开垦的生荒地和熟荒地上播种谷物，今年西伯利亚西部和哈萨克共和国各地的粮食收获总量将大大地增加。到今年八月十日为止，已开垦了一千三百四十万公顷生荒地和熟荒地，即达计划的百分之一百零三点二。超额完成开垦生荒地和熟荒地计划的有：鄂木斯克、阿克摩林斯克、新西伯利亚、契卡洛夫、库尔干、巴夫洛达、邱门、柯克齐塔夫、卡拉干达、车里雅宾斯克、赤塔、阿纠宾斯克、北哈萨克、伊尔库次克、萨拉托夫等州和巴什基尔自治共和国的机器拖拉机站和集体农庄，以及斯大林格勒、罗斯托夫、车里雅宾斯克等州和斯塔夫罗波尔及克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区的国营农场。此外，俄罗斯联邦和哈萨克共和国某些州本来没有开垦生荒地和熟荒地的任务，但那里的机器拖拉机站和集体农庄到八月十日止也开垦了六十一万九千公顷的荒地。其中阿穆尔州的集体农庄开垦了一十六万一千公顷，斯大林格勒州的集体农庄开垦了十二万九千公顷，布利亚蒙古自治共和国的集体农庄开垦了十万零四千公顷。到今年八月十日止，苏联全国的集体农庄和国营农场开垦了一千四百一十万公顷非常肥沃的生荒地和熟荒地。现在，各地机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场还正在继续开垦准备在一九五五年播种的生荒地和熟荒地。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议认为，哈萨克、西伯利亚和乌拉尔等地区今年在开垦生荒地和熟荒地方面所取得的成就，只是开垦未利用的肥沃土地以增加苏联谷物生产这一全民任务的开端。一九五四年开垦一千三百万公顷生荒地和熟荒地的任务远没有用尽我国拥有的进一步扩大集体农庄和国营农场的谷物播种面积和以最小的劳动和物资消耗大大增加谷物生产的巨大潜力。
    苏维埃国家拥有一切条件来迅速开垦大量的生荒地和熟荒地。在我国的农业中，现在有一支熟练的工人和专家大军，我国工业能够满足机器拖拉机站、国营农场和集体农庄对拖拉机、收割联合机、汽车、农业机器以及其他设备和物资的需要。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议决定：
    （一）集体农庄和国营农场开垦荒地和使新土地产生经济价值，这是对增加粮食生产这一全国事业的重大贡献。这一事业是完全符合集体农庄和集体农庄庄员的利益的。因为，这有助于农业各部门生产的迅速发展，保证牲畜的饲料供应，大大提高集体农庄的经济和集体农庄庄员的实物和货币收入。
    正因为如此，各集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场才在今年春天超额完成了在生荒地和熟荒地上播种谷物的计划，现在并在胜利完成和超额完成开垦一九五五年播种的生荒地和熟荒地的任务。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议根据一九五四年开垦荒地的经验，认为有可能以额外开垦生荒地和熟荒地的办法来进一步增加全国谷物的产量。因此，号召集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员、地方党组织以及地方苏维埃机关和农业机关在一九五四年大量地超额完成规定的垦荒任务，以便保证在一九五五年超过原订计划一千三百万公顷至少可以在一千五百万公顷新开垦的土地上播种谷物和其他农作物。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议相信：我国东部地区各集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场根据一九五四年春季的开垦荒地的经验以及在充分地利用机器的情况下，一九五五年春除去在一九五四年开垦的休耕地和秋耕地上下种外，还可以额外开垦大片的荒地来播种谷物和其他农作物。进一步扩大谷物和其他作物的播种面积，以开垦荒地的办法来增加谷物产量，以便在一九五六年就使新开垦的播种谷物和其他农作物的播种面积达到二千八百万至三千万公顷，这是苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、俄罗斯联邦部长会议以及哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域、北高加索和全国其他地区的党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关的最重要的任务。
    苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、俄罗斯联邦部长会议和哈萨克共和国部长会议应尽一切办法帮助地方党组织、地方苏维埃机关和农业机关以及机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场组织，利用和开垦准备在一九五五年和一九五六年播种的生荒地和熟荒地，并应广泛地宣传和推行先进集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场开垦荒地和在新开垦的荒地上提高谷物单位面积产量的经验。
    （二）由于有极大的可能来继续开垦荒地，而且有必要使得在这些田地上种植农作物的工作完全机械化，苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、苏联采购部、苏联汽车、拖拉机和农业机器制造部，应就如何保证为开垦地区各机器拖拉机站、国营农场和集体农庄供应足够的拖拉机、联合机、其他农业机器、汽车、设备、材料和预装配房屋以及如何建造谷仓、仓库、道路和铁路支线提出建议。
    （三）在西伯利亚和哈萨克各地区将主要以成立国营农场的办法来进一步开垦生荒地和熟荒地，因此，苏联国营农场部、俄罗斯联邦部长会议和哈萨克共和国部长会议应当制订在这些地区成立谷物国营农场和为它们提供物质技术保证的措施。
      （四）建议苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、俄罗斯联邦部长会议、哈萨克共和国部长会议，以及开垦地区的地方党组织、地方苏维埃机关和农业机关加强注意为参加开垦工作的工人和专家建设住宅和物质生活福利设施，克服在这方面存在的缺点，为此应在机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场广泛组织住宅和供文化福利机构用的房屋的建设，并尽力鼓励机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员建筑私人住宅。
    苏联贸易部、苏联合作社中央联合会和它们的地方机构，应采取措施改进开垦地区的贸易机构的工作，保证对这些地区的机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员的工业品和食品的不间断的供应，为他们开办足够数量的食堂、茶馆、小店铺、商店、缝衣店和修理厂。
    苏联卫生部、苏联文化部和邮电部应在开垦地区建立足够数目的医院、诊疗所、医药站、图书馆、无线电站、电影站和邮电局分局。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议特别重视以机械师、工程师、技术人员、农艺师和领导工作人员等干部加强开垦荒地的机器拖拉机站和国营农场，并深信，只要需要，数万熟练的工人、农艺师、工程师和技术人员，特别是我们苏联的青年就会像在今年春天一样，热烈响应号召，自愿参加开垦工作。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议号召各级党组织、工会组织和列宁共产主义青年团组织，以及全体集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员及工业企业和运输业的工人广泛展开社会主义竞赛，争取尽速完成上述新增加的全民开垦荒地的任务，不间断地供应农业以拖拉机、农业机器、备件、燃料、设备和其他工业品，并及时把这些机器和物资送到开垦地区。
