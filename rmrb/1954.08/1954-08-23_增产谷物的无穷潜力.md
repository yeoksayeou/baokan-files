    Infinite Potential for Increasing Grain Production
    By our correspondent Li He
    The decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on further reclamation of virgin and fallow land to increase grain production has been met with enthusiastic support from the people of the Soviet Union. It also gives us, the Chinese people, tremendous encouragement. Through this decision, people see how much power the Soviet people have demonstrated in implementing the decisions of the Second and Third Plenums of the Central Committee of the CPSU in just five months; and how much infinite potential the Soviet Union has in increasing grain production.
    I remember this spring, at the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, I met many young workers from various factories who were ready to go. They were excitedly waiting to leave familiar Moscow and their relatives to go to the unfamiliar east to reclaim wasteland. I asked them, "What ideals do you have in going to the new land?" They answered straightforwardly, "For the motherland," "To increase grain production for the country." One seventeen or eighteen-year-old youth thoughtfully said, "So that when we are old, the younger generations will remember that we shed our sweat on the reclaimed new land."
    More than 150,000 such patriots went to the new land this spring. They are skilled workers, engineers, technicians, agronomists, and other agricultural specialists from factories, tractor stations, and state farms all over the Soviet Union. Tens of thousands of agricultural machines were sent. One hundred and twenty-six large grain state farms were established on the new land. As of August 10, state farms, collective farms, and tractor stations had reclaimed 13.4 million hectares of virgin and fallow land. Agricultural laborers in other areas, not included in the plan, have also reclaimed more than 700,000 hectares of new land. We know that before the October Revolution, only about 10 million hectares of land were cultivated in Siberia over three hundred years. Now, it has been greatly exceeded in one year.
    The Soviet patriotic forces have completed the task of reclaiming 13 million hectares of virgin and fallow land ahead of schedule!
    Soviet patriotism and the potential of Soviet land are infinite. Based on the existing achievements, higher requirements have been put forward. The new goal: instead of 13 million hectares, 15 million hectares of new land will be reclaimed in 1955 to increase grain and other crop production, and 28 million to 30 million hectares of new land will be reclaimed in 1956. That is to say, the existing 100 million hectares of grain fields will be expanded by more than a quarter by that time. If each hectare yields an average of 1,500 kilograms (which is entirely possible), then the Soviet Union will increase grain production by 450 million quintals!
    In recent days, the grain exhibition halls at the All-Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, especially the part on reclaimed new land, have attracted more visitors. People want to know how the harvests are on the reclaimed new land. They find the answers here. The Luzayev District Machine Tractor Station in the Kazakh Republic has reclaimed 118,000 hectares of new land for the eight collective farms it serves in recent years, with an average yield of 2,000 to 2,500 kilograms of wheat per hectare. Among them, the "Road to Light" collective farm harvested 2,900 kilograms of spring wheat per hectare from 716 hectares of virgin and fallow land. The grain harvest on the newly reclaimed land in Siberia and the Urals is also very high. The "Telman" collective farm in the Altai Territory of Siberia harvested 2,170 kilograms of wheat per hectare from 300 hectares of new land last year. The "Petropavlovsky" State Farm in Chelyabinsk Oblast harvested 2,037 kilograms of grain per hectare from 30,000 hectares of new land last year, including 2,200 kilograms of wheat per hectare from about 19,000 hectares of new land.
    The 3.6 million hectares of new land sown this spring will soon produce a large amount of grain. Collective farms and state farms in Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River Basin, and other regions of the Russian Federal Republic have sown more than 2 million hectares of wheat, millet, and other crops on the newly reclaimed land this spring, increasing the grain harvesting area in the Russian Federation this year by 2,316,000 hectares compared to last year. The Altai Territory of Siberia planted grain on about 1 million hectares of newly reclaimed land this spring. Now, hundreds of combine harvesters are harvesting 2,500 to 3,000 kilograms of grain from each hectare of land. The Kazakh Republic sowed wheat and millet on more than 1 million hectares of new land, increasing the republic's harvesting area this year by 20 percent compared to last year. The ninety-two state farms established on the new land in various states of Kazakhstan have sown 77,000 hectares.
    A good harvest is underway in many of the reclaimed new lands. Simultaneously with the harvest, the great work of reclaiming virgin and fallow land continues. The new decision of the Soviet Party and government has raised the national movement of reclaiming wasteland and increasing grain production to a new peak. A socialist competition to increase the area of reclaimed wasteland is unfolding everywhere in the new lands of the east and southeast. Due to wasteland reclamation, the Lusipoliang District of Omsk Oblast in Siberia will be able to deliver 6 million poods of commodity grain to the state this year. This district has reclaimed 104,000 hectares of virgin and fallow land this year and will continue to reclaim 130,000 hectares.

### 增产谷物的无穷潜力

    增产谷物的无穷潜力
    本报记者　李何
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议关于进一步开垦生熟荒地以增产谷物的决定，受到苏联全国人民欢声雷动的支持。它也带给我们中国人民以巨大的鼓舞。通过这个决定人们看到：苏联人民在短短五个月期间在实现苏共中央二、三月决定上表现了多么巨大的力量；苏联在增产谷物上含蓄着多么无穷的潜力。
    记得今年春天，在青年团市委会，遇到了许多整装待发的各工厂的青年工人。他们兴奋地等待当天离开熟悉的莫斯科和亲人到生疏的东部开荒去。我问他们：“你们抱着什么理想到新地去？”他们率直地回答：“为了祖国”，“为了给国家增产谷物”。有一位十七、八岁的青年深思地说：“为了年纪大时，年青的后辈记得我们在被开垦的新地上流过自己的汗。”
    十五万以上这样的爱国者在今年春天走到新地去了。他们是全苏联各地工厂、拖拉机站、国营农场的熟练工人、工程师、技师、农艺师和其他农业专门人材。成千累万的农业机器送去了。在新地上建立了一百二十六个大的谷物国营农场。截至八月十日，国营农场、集体农庄和拖拉机站已开垦了一千三百四十万公顷生熟荒地。其他各地不在计划以内的农业劳动者，还开垦了七十万多公顷新地。我们知道，在十月革命以前在西伯利亚三百年间只有约一千万公顷耕地。现在一年就大大超过了。
    苏维埃的爱国主义力量已经提前超计划地完成了开垦一千三百万公顷生熟荒地的任务！
    苏维埃爱国主义和苏联土地的潜力是无穷的。在已有成就的基础上提出了更高的要求。新目标：代替一千三百万公顷要为一九五五年增产谷物和其他作物开垦一千五百万公顷新地，在一九五六年要开垦到二千八百万到三千万公顷新地。这就是说，到那时现有的一亿多公顷谷物田地将扩大四分之一以上。如果每公顷平均收获一千五百公斤（那是完全可能的），那么全苏联将增产四亿五千万公担谷物！
    这些日子来，全苏农业展览会上展览谷物的各馆，特别是开垦新地部分，吸引着更多的参观者。人们想知道被开垦的新地的收成怎样。他们在这里找到了答案。哈萨克共和国卢札也夫区机器拖拉机站最近几年为所服务的八个集体农庄开垦了十一万八千公顷新地，每公顷平均收获了二千到二千五百公斤小麦。其中“光明之路”集体农庄从七百十六公顷生熟荒地上每公顷收获了二千九百公斤春小麦。在西伯利亚和乌拉尔被开垦的新地上，谷物的收成也是很高的。阿尔泰边疆“台尔曼”集体农庄去年从三百公顷新地上每公顷收获了二千一百七十公斤小麦。车里雅宾斯克州“彼得罗巴甫洛夫斯基”国营农场，去年从三万公顷新地上每公顷收获了二千零三十七公斤粮食，其中小麦在约一万九千公顷新地上每公顷收获了二千二百公斤。
    今年春天播种的三百六十万公顷新地即将增产一大批谷物。西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和俄罗斯联邦共和国的其他地区的集体农庄和国营农场，在开垦的新地上今年春天播种了二百多万公顷的小麦、粟子及其他作物，使俄罗斯联邦今年谷物收割面积比去年增多二百三十一万六千公顷。西伯利亚阿尔泰边疆今年春天在开垦的约一百万公顷新地上种了谷物。现在几百个联合收割机手从每公顷土地上收获着二千五百到三千公斤谷物。哈萨克共和国在一百多万公顷新地上播种了小麦和粟子，使共和国的今年收割面积比去年扩大百分之二十。哈萨克斯坦各州新地上建立的九十二个国营农场，播种了七万七千公顷。
    一场很好的收获在许多被开垦了的新地上进行。和收割同时，开垦生熟荒地的巨大工作继续着。苏联党和政府的新决定把开荒增粮的全民运动提到新的高峰。在东部和东南部新地到处展开了增加开荒面积的社会主义竞赛。西伯利亚鄂木斯克州露西波梁区由于开荒，今年能多交给国家六百万普特商品谷物。这个区今年开垦了十万零四千公顷生熟荒地，还将继续开垦十三万公顷。
