    Public Opinion in Various Countries Advocates Maintaining Peace in Asia and Opposes US Plotting of Southeast Asian Aggression Bloc
    Indonesian Minister of Information
    Indonesian Minister of Information, Tubin, told a reporter from "Social Messenger" that Indonesia will not participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization planned by the United States because doing so would violate Indonesia's active independent policy. He said that Indonesia hopes to contribute to the cause of world peace, especially in Southeast Asia. He believes that if the purpose is to discuss the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization issue, it is unnecessary to convene the Colombo countries conference. He also said that if the meeting is convened to discuss Asian issues to strengthen ties between Asian countries, it would be much more beneficial.
    Sri Lankan Parliamentarians
    The Sri Lankan Parliament held a debate on the issue of the US-planned "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" on the 4th. Many parliamentarians spoke, expressing their strong opposition to this aggressive "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."
    Parliamentarian and former Minister of Commerce and Trade, R.G. Senanayake, asked: Why propose the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" at a stage when the world has already achieved peace? He believes that the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" will be used to achieve "offensive purposes rather than defensive purposes."
    Parliamentarian and former Prime Minister, Dudley Senanayake, said that the main goal of Asia should be to "maintain peace."
    Parliamentarian K. Suntheralingam demanded that the Sri Lankan Prime Minister refuse to participate in the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" and clearly tell US Secretary of State Dulles that we will not participate in his anti-communist activities.
    Opposition leader in Parliament, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, said: Any country participating in the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" will have to "walk the American line." He requested that Sri Lanka use the five principles stated in the agreement signed between China and India on trade and transportation between China's Tibet region and India as a basis for concluding bilateral agreements with its neighbors.
    Sri Lankan Prime Minister Kotelawala stated in his reply at the meeting that he would keep Sri Lanka neutral and hold meetings with the Colombo conference countries to discuss joint actions.
    Indian Newspapers
    The Indian "Free Press" published an editorial on the 4th, saying: "When the United States first proposed the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Southeast Asia, it only recruited two countries - Thailand and the Philippines. Despite its threats and inducements, other free countries in the region have opposed it. They are convinced that this organization is of no benefit to the peace of the region; on the contrary, it is a conspiracy to undermine peace."
    An editorial in the "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published in Calcutta wrote that if India agrees to the US plan, it would be in "direct violation of the policy of peaceful coexistence declared by India, China, and Burma."
    The influential "National Herald," which supports the government, wrote that if "the participants of the Colombo Conference (India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan) insist on the position of the declarations they have passed, then there can be nothing in common between them and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. If India first refuses the British proposal not to attend the meeting to establish the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, it is only doing what everyone expected. If there was no need to establish the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization before the end of the Geneva Conference, then there is even less need for it after an agreement on the Indochina issue has been reached."
    The newspaper emphasized: "If the people of Asia are willing to work together to maintain peace in Asia, then what measures must be implemented are what they should consider." The newspaper believes that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization will undermine the achievements of the Geneva Conference. If Britain decides to follow the United States along with Australia, New Zealand, or any country participating in the Colombo Conference, then it should be responsible for any new instability and possible tensions in the relationship between Commonwealth countries in the future.
    Indonesian Newspapers
    Indonesian newspapers unanimously pointed out that the Southeast Asian aggression bloc that the United States is stepping up to piece together violates the independent policies of Asian countries.
    The Indonesian "People's Daily" said on the 5th that the call to oppose the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is growing. This call of opposition comes not only from Indonesia, but also from all over Asia. In pointing out the failure of the United States to piece together the Southeast Asian aggression bloc, the "People's Daily" said that any treaty on Asia without the participation of countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and the People's Republic of China is equivalent to an Asian treaty without Asian participation. The newspaper said that if the broad masses of the Asian people do not participate, and yet find the United States mixed in with a small group of countries participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, it is even more strange. In history, the United States has never been a part of Asia.
    The "Fountain" published an editorial on the 5th, saying that although the United States very much wants to and has made every effort to pull Indonesia into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the United States has been defeated in the face of Indonesia's independent policy. If Indonesia participates in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, it is tantamount to abandoning its independent policy and throwing itself into the US bloc. However, the independent policy is the factor that unites the Indonesian nation. The newspaper concluded: "If we still hope to maintain our political position in the world, especially in Asia, we must fully maintain our country's independent policy."
    The "Independence" also expressed opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization on the 4th. "Independence" said that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization would never be suitable for Indonesia's independent policy based on peace and international friendship. The newspaper went on to say that Indonesia does not trust the United States. The newspaper also pointed out that a Southeast Asian military treaty would certainly bring danger to the people of Asian countries.
    The "National Vanguard" said on the 4th that participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is not good for Indonesia. Indonesia hopes to build its own country, and this cannot be done if there is a lack of a peaceful atmosphere at home. The Southeast Asia Treaty plan is the product of the failure of US policy in Indochina, and it contains the seeds of harm to world peace, especially peace in Southeast Asia. The newspaper also pointed out that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization will become an obstacle to resolving the West Irian issue.

### 各国公众和舆论主张维护亚洲地区的和平  反对美国策划东南亚侵略集团

专栏：

    各国公众和舆论主张维护亚洲地区的和平
    反对美国策划东南亚侵略集团
      印尼情报部部长
    印尼情报部部长杜斌对“社会使者报”记者说，印尼不会参加美国所计划的东南亚公约组织，因为这样做将是违反印尼的积极的独立政策。他说，印尼希望对世界、特别是东南亚的和平事业有所贡献。他认为，如果目的是为了讨论东南亚公约组织问题的话，召开科伦坡国家会议是不必要的。他又说，假如召开会议是为了讨论亚洲问题以加强亚洲国家之间的联系的话，那就有益得多。
    锡兰国会议员
    锡兰国会四日就美国策划中的“东南亚公约组织”问题举行辩论。议员多人发言表示他们强烈反对这个侵略性的“东南亚公约组织”。
    国会议员、前商务贸易部长鲁·格·沈纳那亚克问道：为什么在这个世界已经得到和平的阶段要提出“东南亚公约组织”呢？他认为，“东南亚公约组织”将被利用来达到“进攻的目的而不是防御的目的”。
    国会议员、前总理杜德莱·沈纳那亚克说，亚洲的主要目标应该是“维护和平”。
    议员克·松舍拉林加姆要求锡兰总理拒绝参加
  “东南亚公约组织”，并明白告诉美国国务卿杜勒斯说：我们不参加他的反共活动。
    国会反对党领袖吴·鲁·德·班达拉纳克说：参加“东南亚公约组织”的任何国家都将不得不
  “走美国路线”。他要求：锡兰以中国和印度所签订的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定所说明的五项原则作为基础，来和邻国缔结双边协定。
    锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉在会议上作答复时表示，他将要使锡兰保持中立，并将同科伦坡会议国家举行会议来商讨共同的行动。
      印度报纸
    印度“自由新闻”四日发表社论说：“当美国首先在东南亚提出东南亚公约组织的建议时，它只网罗到两个国家——泰国和菲律宾。尽管它进行威胁利诱，这个地区的其他自由国家一直加以反对。它们深信这个组织对于这个地区的和平毫无好处，相反的，它是破坏和平的阴谋。”
    加尔各答出版的“甘露市场报”的社论写道，如果印度赞同美国的计划，那就“直接违反印度、中国和缅甸所宣布的和平共处政策”。
    支持政府的有势力的“国民先驱报”写道，如果“科伦坡会议的参加者（印度、印尼、缅甸、锡兰和巴基斯坦）坚持它们所通过的宣言的立场，那么它们和东南亚公约组织之间不可能有任何共同之处。如果印度首先拒绝英国的建议，不参加建立东南亚公约组织的会议，那也不过是做了大家意料之中的事。如果说在日内瓦会议结束之前并没有成立东南亚公约组织的必要，那么，在就印度支那问题达成协议之后就更没有必要了。”
    报纸强调说：“如果亚洲人民愿意共同努力来维持亚洲和平，那么必须实行怎样的措施，正是应当由他们考虑的事情。”报纸认为，东南亚公约组织会破坏日内瓦会议所达成的成就。如果英国决定和澳大利亚、新西兰或是参加科伦坡会议的任何国家一起跟着美国走，那么将来如果在英联邦国家的关系中造成新的不稳定和可能的紧张局势，它就应该负责。
      印尼报纸
    印尼报纸一致指出美国正在加紧拼凑中的东南亚侵略集团违犯亚洲国家的独立政策。
    印尼“人民日报”五日说，反对东南亚公约组织的呼声正在与日俱增。这种反对的呼声不仅来自印尼，而且来自亚洲各地。“人民日报”在指出美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团遭到的失败时说，任何关于亚洲的条约，如果没有印度、印尼、缅甸等国以及中华人民共和国的参加，那就等于是一个没有亚洲参加的亚洲条约。这家报纸说，如果广大亚洲人民没有参加，而却发现美国掺杂在一小撮参与东南亚公约组织的国家之中，那就更令人奇怪了。在历史上，美国从来就不是亚洲的一部分。
      “泉源报”五日发表社论说，尽管美国很想并且尽了一切努力，要把印尼拉入东南亚公约组织，美国已在印尼的独立政策面前遭到了失败。如果印尼参加东南亚公约组织，那就无异于放弃它的独立政策而投身于美国集团。但是，独立政策是使印尼民族团结一致的因素。这家报纸最后说：“如果我们仍然希望在世界上、特别在亚洲维持我们的政治地位，我们必须充分保持我国的独立政策”。
    “独立报”四日也表示反对东南亚公约组织。
  “独立报”说，东南亚公约组织是绝不会适合印尼的以和平和国际友谊为基础的独立政策的。这家报纸接着说，印尼不信任美国。报纸并指出，东南亚军事条约一定会给亚洲各国人民带来危险。
      “民族先锋报”四日说，参加东南亚公约组织对印尼没有好处。印尼希望建设自己的国家，而如果国内缺乏和平气氛的话，是无法进行这种建设的。东南亚公约计划是美国政策在印度支那遭到失败以后的产物，它包藏着危害世界和平、特别是东南亚和平的种子。这家报纸并指出，东南亚公约组织将成为解决西伊里安问题的一个障碍。
