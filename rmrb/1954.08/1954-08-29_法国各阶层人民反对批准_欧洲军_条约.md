Xinhua News Agency, August 27th, Paris Dispatch: On the eve of the French National Assembly's discussion of the "European Defense Community" treaty, the struggle of the French people of all strata against the ratification of the Paris Treaty is growing stronger, and many members of the French parliament and political figures also express a negative attitude towards the "European Defense Community."

    On the 25th, the Industrial Production Committee of the French National Assembly decided to oppose the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty. This is another committee within the National Assembly, following the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Defense Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Overseas Territories Committee, and the Finance Committee, to express its opposition.

    Fourteen French political figures, including Honorary Speaker of the National Assembly Édouard Herriot and General Weygand, former commander-in-chief of the French army, issued a statement on the 26th opposing the "European Army" treaty. The statement said that there are more satisfactory ways, both militarily and politically, to solve the German problem than the "European Army" treaty. The statement also said: "Rejecting the European Defense Community does not destroy our (referring to France and Western countries) alliance."

    General de Gaulle issued a declaration on the 26th opposing the "European Defense Community" treaty. He accused that the establishment of the "European Defense Community" is "a conspiracy to deprive France of its independence and its army, and to separate France from its overseas territories."

    Former Minister Paul Bastid, in a conversation with a delegation from the French Committee for a Peaceful Solution to the German Question, stated that he was "clearly" "opposed to the treaty."

    At the same time, a group of American agents in France who advocate the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty have also stepped up their activities. According to a Reuters report, they are "desperately wooing wavering members of parliament." The likes of Piddault, notorious for his pro-American activities, are gathering forces to launch a "Save the European Army" movement. The Socialist Party leadership also issued a statement reaffirming its support for the "European Army" proposal. There are also reports that some cabinet ministers who support the "European Army" treaty are threatening to "collectively withdraw from the government" when the parliamentary debate begins.

    Xinhua News Agency, August 28th, TASS Paris, August 27th: The Council of the French Union (an institution whose members are half representatives of the suzerain state and half representatives of the "overseas territories" and "member states" of the "Union," and which has the right to express opinions for consultation on bills of the French National Assembly or the government concerning the French Union) passed a resolution by a vote of 100 to 68 opposing the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty. In presenting a report on behalf of the various foreign relations committees, Berteaux said that the purpose and nature of the "European Defense Community" treaty were harmful to "the moral and material unity of the French Union and the maintenance of the Union." Berteaux recommended rejecting the treaty.

    Guyon, speaking on behalf of the Defense Committee, also recommended not ratifying the treaty on the grounds that accepting it would undermine the unity of the armed forces of the French Union.

    法国各阶层人民反对批准“欧洲军”条约
    【新华社二十七日讯】巴黎消息：在法国国民议会讨论“欧洲防务集团”条约的前夕，法国各阶层人民反对批准巴黎条约的斗争日益强大，法国许多议会议员和政界人士也对“欧洲防务集团”表示否定的态度。
    二十五日，法国民议会工业生产委员会决定反对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约。这是国民议会内继外交委员会、国防委员会、司法委员会、海外领地委员会以及财政委员会之后提出反对意见的又一个委员会。
    国民议会荣誉议长爱德华·赫里欧和曾任法军总司令的魏刚将军等十四名法国政界人士在二十六日发表声明，反对“欧洲军”条约。声明说：就解决德国问题来说，在军事上和政治上比“欧洲军”条约令人满意的办法是有的。声明又说：“拒绝欧洲防务集团并不是破坏我们的（指法国和西方国家的）联盟。”
    戴高乐将军二十六日发表宣言反对“欧洲防务集团”条约。他指责说：成立“欧洲防务集团”是
  “一种剥夺法国的独立和它的军队、把法国和它的海外领土分离开来的阴谋。”
    前部长保罗·巴斯迪在和法国和平解决德国问题委员会的代表团谈话时表示他是“明白地”“反对条约的。”
    与此同时，一批主张批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的美国在法国的代理人也加强了活动。据路透社报道，他们“正在拼命拉拢犹豫不决的议员。”以亲美活动而臭名远扬的皮杜尔之流正在纠集力量准备展开一个“挽救欧洲军”的运动。社会党领导机构也发表了一个声明，重申支持“欧洲军”的主张。另外还有消息说，一些拥护“欧洲军”条约的内阁部长扬言要在议会辩论开始时“集体退出政府”。
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十七日讯：法兰西联邦议会（这个机构成员中一半是宗主国代表，另一半是“海外领地”和“联邦成员国”的代表，议会对法国国民议会或政府有关法兰西联邦问题的法案有权表示意见以供咨询）以一百票对六十八票通过了一项决议，反对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约。贝尔多在代表各对外联系委员会做报告时说，“欧洲防务集团”条约的目的和性质对“法兰西联邦道义和物质的团结及联邦的维持”是有害处的。贝尔多建议拒绝这个条约。
    代表防务委员会发言的葛荣也建议不批准条约，理由是，接受这个条约会破坏法兰西联邦武装力量的统一。
