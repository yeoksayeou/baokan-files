Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th: The Czechoslovakian and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission submitted to the Military Armistice Commission on August 12 their investigation regarding the mutual rotations of personnel and replacement of materials in March of this year. The investigation once again proves that the U.S. side violated the Armistice Agreement by continuing to import reinforcement war materials from outside of Korea.

The investigation pointed out: "The military personnel rotations and war materials replacements carried out by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in March 1954 did not exceed the limits stipulated in the various clauses of the Armistice Agreement." This proves that the Korean-Chinese side strictly abided by the Armistice Agreement.

Commenting on the U.S. replacement of war materials, the investigation pointed out that the U.S. side did not replace warplanes in accordance with the "one-for-one of the same performance and type" provision. The investigation stated: The U.S. side "continued to fail to report on the replacement of all warplanes, and by the end of March 1954, the side had imported from outside Korea more of certain types and subtypes of warplanes than it had exported." According to the statistics made in the reports of various Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, by the end of March of this year, the U.S. side had violated the Armistice Agreement by importing more than a dozen types and subtypes of warplanes into Korea. These types and subtypes of warplanes were the main types and subtypes used on the Korean battlefield, such as F-86-F10, F-86-F30, RB-26-C, etc.

The investigation then pointed out: The U.S. side also "continued to import disassembled parts and components of war materials without reporting to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission." According to the reports of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, by the end of February 1954, the large number of disassembled parts and components of war materials imported by the U.S. side without reporting to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission could at least be assembled into 465 cannons and howitzers of various calibers, 1,365 machine guns of various calibers, 6,400 rocket launchers of various calibers, and 145 mortars of various calibers. In March, the U.S. side continued to illegally import war materials, including more than 630 cannon barrels of various cannons ranging from 37mm to 155mm in caliber, and more than 190 carbine rifles.

    中立国监察委员会捷、波委员的审定
    又一次证实美方非法运入增援性作战物资
    【新华社开城十九日电】中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员在八月十二日向军事停战委员会提交了关于今年三月份双方轮换替换的审定。审定又一次证明美方违反停战协定，继续从朝鲜境外运进增援性作战物资。
    审定指出：“朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面在一九五四年三月份所进行的军事人员轮换和作战物资替换，没有超过停战协定各条款所规定的限额。”这证明朝中方面是严格遵守停战协定的。
    审定在评论美方作战物资替换时指出，美方没有按照“同样性能同样类型的一件换一件”的规定进行作战飞机的替换。审定说：美方“继续未就全部作战飞机的替换提出报告，并且到一九五四年三月底为止，该方自朝鲜境外已运入的某些类型和副型的作战飞机多过它所运出的”。根据各中立国视察小组报告所作的统计，到今年三月底为止，美方违反停战协定超额运进朝鲜的有十几种类型和副型的作战飞机。这些类型和副型的作战飞机都是朝鲜战场上使用的主要的类型和副型，如F—86—F10、F—86—F30、RB—26—C等。
    审定接着指出：美方还“继续运入作战物资的拆散件和零件而不向中立国监察委员会提出报告”。根据中立国视察小组的报告，到一九五四年二月底为止，美方运入而未向中立国监察委员会报告的大量作战物资的散件、拆散件和零件，至少可以装配成各种口径的炮和榴弹炮四百六十五门，各种口径的机关枪一千三百六十五挺，各种口径的火箭炮六千四百门，各种口径的迫击炮一百四十五门。三月份，美方继续非法运进作战物资，其中有三七公厘至一五五公厘口径的各种炮的炮筒六百三十多个、卡宾枪铳一百九十多支。
