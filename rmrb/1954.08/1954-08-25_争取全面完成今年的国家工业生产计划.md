    Strive to Comprehensively Fulfill This Year's National Industrial Production Plan
    Lin Jun
    The performance of state-owned industrial enterprises in fulfilling the national production plan in the first half of this year was generally good. According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, enterprises under the five central industrial ministries completed 106% of their planned output value for the first half of the year, fulfilling 52% of the annual plan, with a total output value exceeding the same period last year by 37%. Among the 37 major products, 34 completed their production volume plans. The balance of plan execution has also improved. This shows that the leadership and management level of our enterprises has taken a step forward.

    Although the industrial production plan for the first half of the year was completed better than in any previous year, analyzing the economic and technical activities of various departments and enterprises reveals that many problems still exist: Many departments and enterprises only completed or exceeded the planned output value and production volume, but did not complete the variety plan, new product trial production plan, financial cost plan, labor wage plan, or other economic and technical quota targets. Although most departments and enterprises completed the half-year production plan, they did not complete the plan evenly every month; some enterprises did not even complete the half-year plan. For example, factories and mines under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry exceeded the total output value plan and profit delivery plan every month, but 15% to 20% of the factories and mines still failed to complete the state plan each month; among the 22 major products, five frequently failed to meet the state plan. The Central First Ministry of Machine Building, while completing the output value, profit, and cost reduction plans for the first half of this year, did not complete the variety plan and new product trial production plan; even in terms of output value, one-fifth to one-quarter of the factories failed to meet the target each month. For example, the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry analyzed the execution results of the first quarter's cost reduction plan and found that behind the figure of exceeding the cost reduction plan by 2.9%, some serious shortcomings were still concealed. The most important of these was that some factories and mines did not rely on improving efficiency, reducing raw material consumption, and reducing waste to complete the cost reduction plan, but instead relied on adopting higher-grade ore, suppressing wage levels, and reducing basic wage and additional expenses through improper means.

    Another problem existing in the production during the first half of this year was the low product quality and frequent production accidents. It is undeniable that many enterprises and relevant leading departments have paid attention to improving product quality, and have gradually formulated and promulgated quality standards, strengthened the leadership of technical work, and with the specific assistance of Soviet experts and the efforts of employees, the quality of many products has improved compared to the past, and some long-standing technical problems affecting quality have been initially resolved. However, because some enterprise leaders still do not pay enough attention to product quality, do not earnestly implement the technical responsibility system, do not earnestly implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and because some raw materials are of low quality and lack the necessary quality inspection tools and instruments, the quality of many products is still not good enough or stable enough, and the rejection rate, defect rate, and rework rate are still high. The casting rejection rate of some machinery factories is as high as 40% or more, the qualification rate of some steel materials is still very low, and the qualification rate of paper in the light industry sector did not meet the requirements of the national plan for most factories in April. The waste and losses caused by low product quality are enormous.

    The situation of major casualties in the first half of this year is very serious. According to statistics from the six central industrial ministries from January to May, although the accident mortality rate was lower than in the same period last year, the number of major casualties and the number of injuries and deaths were higher than in the same period last year. Equipment accidents are also very serious. The losses suffered by various industrial departments due to equipment accidents range from more than 20,000 machine-hours to more than 10,000 machine-hours. The reason why casualty accidents and equipment accidents are still very serious is mainly because some enterprise leaders have not earnestly implemented the policy of safe production, and some even regard production and safety as opposing each other. Therefore, they have not regularly conducted safety production education for employees to improve their vigilance against accidents; they have not earnestly implemented the safety responsibility system, and have not given education and criticism to individual employees who violate operating procedures, and have not seriously dealt with accidents of all sizes that have occurred.

    The balance between production, supply, and sales in the first half of the year has greatly improved, but to date, some departments and enterprises still cannot meet the needs of society due to the limited variety and specifications of products or insufficient raw material supply; and some products are stockpiled due to outdated specifications or poor quality.

    The above situation not only shows that the current management work of industrial enterprises is far from reaching the socialist management level, but also shows that to comprehensively fulfill this year's national plan, enterprises still need to do a lot of arduous work. First and foremost, it is crucial for cadres of factories and mines to prevent the growth of complacency. As the production achievements of factories and mines can be expressed in concrete figures, and many enterprises often exceed their plans under the efforts of the vast number of employees, such achievements easily breed complacency in those who cannot withstand the test of victory. They are satisfied with the completion of individual planned targets, especially output value and production volume targets, while ignoring the poor completion of other planned targets. They are satisfied with the temporary improvement of enterprise management and do not continue to consolidate and improve it, even allowing some of the shortcomings that have been overcome to reappear. They do not modestly learn from advanced Soviet experience, especially the advanced experience created by other units, so that problems that have long been solved in other units cannot be solved in the units they manage. Because of their complacency, they refuse to listen to users' opinions and reject criticism from subordinates or superiors. In practice, there are many examples of leaders of enterprises becoming complacent and causing losses to the state. For example, the state-owned Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory shifted from producing simple small generators to producing more technically complex electrical switches last year. With the help of the higher-level leading organs and the work team of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, it initially implemented operation plans and improved the management level of the enterprise, thus better completing the national plan for the first quarter of this year. However, the factory leaders were satisfied with this little progress and began to neglect the improvement of technical work, turning a blind eye to the phenomenon of arbitrary modification of product drawings and careless inspection, believing that "the poor product quality is because the factory's foundation is poor, and it cannot be required too strictly." From then on, the door to progress was blocked. As a result, by May, it only completed 74.5% of the planned output value; completed 16% of the commodity plan; none of the six products completed the quantity plan; the balance rate was only 10%; the quality was poor, and 17 ordering units requested returns. Such examples exist not only in various departments and regions, but also are not isolated. We should learn from their lessons and resolutely overcome complacency.

    While correctly assessing the achievements of the work, the leading cadres of each enterprise should simultaneously discover and propose methods to overcome the shortcomings and errors in the operation and management of the enterprise, and continuously improve the socialist level of the enterprise. To achieve a true socialist enterprise management level, the enterprise must: First, implement planned management, so that all production activities are carried out according to plan at all times; second, promote the production area management responsibility system and the factory director responsibility system, so that labor organization is more reasonable and that every department and every job has someone responsible; third, strengthen the leadership of technical work to stabilize, consolidate, and improve product quality, and to ensure the completion of the new product trial production plan; fourth, promote economic accounting, and resolutely overcome the remnants of the supply system ideology that only asks about production, does not ask about material supply and product sales, does not calculate production costs, does not calculate capital turnover, and does not calculate profits; fifth, strengthen the political work of the enterprise, continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the workers, overcome the influence of all non-socialist ideas among the workers, and at the same time carry out socialist labor competition to ensure the completion of the national plan. These tasks cannot be done well all at once in a short period of time. Each enterprise can improve the operation and management level of the enterprise at different periods by solving more prominent problems in production and taking them as the center of work. For example, at present, enterprises can improve the operation and management level of the enterprise by solving the problems of low product quality, frequent production safety accidents, and imbalance between supply, production, and sales. However, since the above five tasks are interconnected and inseparable, every factory and mine should determine and carry out the central work on the basis of arranging the overall work at any time, and should not isolate the central work from the overall work. Only in this way can the overall work be promoted through the central work of each period, and the operation and management of the enterprise can be gradually brought to the socialist level; and only in this way can the comprehensive and balanced completion of the national plan be effectively guaranteed.

    When striving to comprehensively complete the national plan, each production factory and mine must actively further overcome the imbalance of production, supply, and sales plans for certain products. For those products with a guaranteed supply of raw materials and no sales problems, efforts should be made to exceed the national plan; for those products with sales but with real difficulties in the supply of raw materials, raw materials should be used sparingly or substitutes should be used under the principle of ensuring quality to strive to exceed the national plan; for those products that have no sales, production should be reduced in accordance with the national plan to avoid stockpiling and waste.

    The completion of the national plan in the first half of the year has prepared favorable conditions for striving to comprehensively complete this year's national plan. There is no doubt that as long as the leading cadres and all employees of each enterprise guard against arrogance and rashness, and make persistent efforts, they will be able to comprehensively complete the second year's plan of the five-year construction plan.

    争取全面完成今年的国家工业生产计划
    林君
    今年上半年，国营工业企业完成国家生产计划的情况，基本上是好的。根据国家统计局的统计，中央五个工业部所属企业完成上半年产值计划的百分之一○六，完成全年计划的百分之五十二，总产值超过去年同时期百分之三十七。在三十七种主要产品中，有三十四种完成了产量计划。执行计划的均衡性也有所改进。这说明我们企业的领导与管理水平，已向前进了一步。
      上半年的工业生产计划虽然比已往任何一年都完成得好，但是如果对各部门各企业的经济、技术的活动进行分析，那就发现其中仍然存在不少问题：许多部门和企业单位，只完成或超额完成了产值计划和产量计划，而没有完成品种计划、新产品试制计划、财务成本计划、劳动工资计划或其他经济的和技术的定额指标。多数部门和企业虽然完成了半年的生产计划，但不是每一个月都均衡地完成了计划；有的企业甚至连半年计划也没有完成，例如中央重工业部所属厂矿，总的产值计划和上缴利润计划每月都超额完成了，但每个月仍有百分之十五到二十的厂矿没有完成国家计划；二十二种主要产品中也经常有五种完不成国家计划。中央第一机械工业部，今年上半年的产值、利润和降低成本计划虽然都完成了，但没有完成品种计划和新产品试制计划；即使是产值计划，每一个月也有五分之一到四分之一的工厂没有完成。又如中央重工业部有色金属工业管理局分析第一季度降低成本计划的执行结果，发现了在超额百分之二点九完成降低成本计划的数字后面，仍掩盖着一些严重的缺点。其中最主要的就是某些工厂和矿山不是靠提高效率、降低原材料的消耗、减少浪费等来完成降低成本计划，而是依靠采用较高品位的矿石，依靠压低工资水平、减少基本工资和附加费的开支等不正当的办法来完成的。
    在今年上半年生产中存在的另一个问题，就是产品质量低和生产事故多。不可否认，许多企业及有关的领导部门已经注意提高产品质量，并为此逐步制订和颁发了质量标准，加强了对技术工作的领导，再加上苏联专家的具体帮助和职工的努力，许多产品质量比以前已有所改进，一些长期没有解决的影响质量的技术问题也初步得到了解决。但是由于有些企业领导干部对产品质量仍不够重视，没有认真贯彻技术责任制度，没有认真贯彻苏联专家建议，再加上有些原材料质量低和缺乏必要的质量检验工具仪器等，所以许多产品的质量仍不够好，或不够稳定，废品率、次品率、返工率还很高。部分机械工厂的铸件废品率竟高到百分之四十以上，某些钢材的合格率还很低，轻工业方面的纸张的合格率，四月份大部分工厂都没有达到国家计划的要求。由于产品质量低而造成的浪费损失是巨大的。
    今年上半年重大伤亡事故的情况是很严重的。根据中央六个工业部一至五月的统计，虽然事故死亡率比去年同期的少了，但发生重大伤亡事故的次数和伤亡人数却比去年同期的多了。设备事故也很严重。各工业部门因设备事故而停工所受的损失，多的有二万多台时，少的有一万多台时。伤亡事故和设备事故所以还很严重，主要是由于有些企业的领导干部没有认真贯彻安全生产的方针，有的甚至把生产与安全对立起来。因此，他们没有经常对职工进行安全生产的教育，以提高职工对事故的警惕性；没有认真贯彻安全责任制度，对个别违反操作规程的职工也没有给以教育和批评，对已经发生的大小事故也没作严肃的处理。
    上半年的产供销平衡的情况已有很大的改善，但迄今还有些部门和企业的产品因产品的品种规格太少，或因原材料供应不足，不能满足社会的需要；且有部分产品因规格陈旧或质量不好而积压。
    上述情况不只说明了目前工业企业的管理工作远没有达到社会主义的管理水平，同时也说明了要全面地完成今年的国家计划，还需要各企业做很多很艰巨的工作。首先和最重要的，就是各厂矿企业干部应该防止骄傲自满情绪的滋长。由于厂矿企业的生产成就都是可以用具体数目字表现出来的，而很多企业在广大职工的努力下，又经常超额完成计划，这种成就，往往就容易使那些经不起胜利考验的人滋长骄傲自满情绪，他们满足于个别计划指标，特别是产值计划指标和产量计划指标的完成，而忽视其它计划指标完成得不好的情况。他们满足于企业管理工作一时的改进，而不继续加以巩固和提高，甚至使某些已经克服了的缺点又恢复起来。他们不虚心学习苏联先进经验，尤其不虚心学习别的单位所创造的先进经验，致使在别的单位早已解决了的问题，在他所管理的单位里还得不到解决。他们由于骄傲自满，就会拒绝听取用户的意见，拒绝来自下级或上级的批评。在实际生活中，由于企业的领导干部滋长了自满情绪而给国家带来损失的例子是很多的。例如国营沈阳高压开关厂去年由生产技术较简单的小发电机转为生产技术较复杂的电器开关等产品，并在上级领导机关和中共沈阳市委会工作组的帮助下，初步推行了作业计划，提高了企业的管理水平，因而较好地完成今年第一季度的国家计划。但该厂领导干部满足于这一点点的进步，开始忽视对技术工作的改进，对下面任意修改产品图纸和检查马虎的现象熟视无睹，认为“产品质量差是因为本厂基础差，不能要求过严。”从此把前进的大门堵住了。结果，到五月份，只完成产值计划的百分之七十四点五；完成商品计划的百分之十六；六种产品都没有完成数量计划；均衡率也只有百分之十；质量低劣，有十七个订货单位要求退货。这样的例子，在各部门、各地区不仅有，并且不是个别的。我们应该吸取它们的教训，坚决克服骄傲自满情绪。
    每一个企业的领导干部，在正确地估计工作的成就的时候，应同时发现并提出办法来克服企业的经营管理工作的缺点和错误，不断地提高企业的社会主义水平。企业要达到真正的社会主义企业管理水平，就要：一、实行计划管理，使一切生产活动时刻都按计划进行；二、推行生产区域管理责任制和厂长负责制，使劳动组织更加合理，使每一个部门、每一件工作都有人负责；三、加强对技术工作的领导，以便稳定、巩固和提高产品质量，以便保证新产品试制计划的完成；四、推行经济核算制，切实克服那种只问生产，不问材料供应和产品销售，不计算生产成本，不计算资金周转，不计算利润的供给制思想残余；五、加强企业的政治工作，不断地提高职工群众的社会主义觉悟，克服一切非社会主义思想在职工群众中的影响，同时要开展社会主义劳动竞赛，以保证国家计划的完成。这些工作是不可能在一个短时期内一下子都做好的。每个企业在各个不同时期都可以通过解决生产中比较突出的问题，并以之为工作中心来提高企业的经营管理水平。例如在目前，各企业可以分别通过解决产品质量低、生产安全事故多，以及供产销不平衡等问题来提高企业的经营管理水平。但是，由于上述五项工作是彼此联系着的，不可分割的，所以每一个厂矿企业在任何时候，都应该在安排全面工作的基础上确定和进行中心工作，而不应该把中心工作从全面工作中孤立起来。只有这样，才能通过各个时期的中心工作推动全面工作，一步一步地使企业的经营管理达到社会主义的水平；也只有这样，全面地均衡地完成国家计划才有切实的保证。
    各生产厂矿企业在争取全面完成国家计划的时候，必须积极地进一步克服某些产品的产供销计划不平衡状况。对那些原材料供应有保证，销路无问题的产品，应争取超额完成国家计划；对那些有销路，但原材料供应确有困难的产品，应在保证质量的原则下，节约原材料的使用或采用代用品，争取超过国家计划；对那些确实没有销路的产品，则应按照国家计划减产，以避免积压和浪费。
    上半年完成国家计划的情况，已给争取全面完成今年国家计划准备了有利条件。毫无疑问，只要每一个企业的领导干部和全体职工戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，定能全面地完成五年建设计划中的第二年的计划的。
