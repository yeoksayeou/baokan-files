    People's Assessor Yang Hong
    Zhao Weihou
    People's courts at all levels shall, in accordance with the law, implement a system of people's assessors in the trial of cases.
    ——Article 75 of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China

    Yang Hong, director of the Qianmen District Construction Industry Working Committee in Beijing, a representative of the Qianmen District People's Congress, and a painter, was recently elected as an assessor of the Qianmen District People's Court. After the draft constitution was announced, I had an opportunity to meet him and hear his thoughts on serving as a people's assessor.

    Yang Hong considers the implementation of the people's assessor system by the people's courts to be very important. He believes that the implementation of the people's assessor system can not only improve the handling of cases, but more importantly, this system fully demonstrates that the people are the masters of the country.

    Yang Hong is fifty-one years old this year. Like other working people, he suffered from the bullying of the reactionary rulers and their henchmen in the old society. At that time, the law was a shackle for the working people, and the courts were established solely to suppress the people. The people's human rights were violated at any time. Yang Hong started as a painter at the age of fifteen. At that time, working as a painter did not guarantee work every day. In good years, there were only seven or eight months of work a year; in worse years, one had to pawn or sell things during the holidays. During the year the Japanese invaders occupied Beijing, he had no work and pulled a rickshaw for three months. One day, as he was pulling the rickshaw across the road, a policeman said he was pulling too slowly and hit him on the shoulder with a wooden club. Police, military police, and secret agents beat people arbitrarily, which was a common occurrence at that time. In 1948, before the liberation of Beijing, Yang Hong was again out of work for a long time. He and his junior apprentice, Wang Wenbin, barely made a living selling fruit candies. One day, he was at the west entrance of Qifeng Building in Dongdan when he suddenly saw a crowd of people surrounding Wang Wenbin. He rushed over and saw a puppet soldier grabbing Wang Wenbin by the back of his collar, while another puppet soldier grabbed his arm, pushing and pulling him away. When Wang Wenbin saw Yang Hong, he felt like he had seen a relative and shouted anxiously, "Brother! Please send a message to my family!" Yang Hong wanted to find out what was going on, so he followed closely. Finally, he saw Wang Wenbin being taken into a large courtyard. Yang Hong was about to run back, but after only a few steps, a plainclothes secret agent blocked his way and asked him, "What are you doing!" He replied that he was selling candy and that the person who had been arrested was his junior apprentice, and he wanted to know what was going on. The secret agent, without explanation, took him into the courtyard as well. As soon as he entered the courtyard, he heard a commotion inside, with the sound of slaps. Wang Wenbin was calling out in a hoarse voice. He knew Wang Wenbin was being beaten. After a while, an officer-like person came out of the room, pointed at him, and asked, "Who is this?" The secret agent replied, "He's with him!" The officer said, "None of them are good! Beat him!" After the officer said this, he left, and another person came out, questioned him for a while, and then released him. Wang Wenbin was detained overnight, and his family spent money to bribe officials before he was released. When he was released, the secret agents even made him sign and stamp a statement to prove that he had not been beaten. What kind of organization was this that arbitrarily arrested and beat people? Yang Hong later heard that it was some kind of rear hospital of the Kuomintang army. Wang Wenbin was beaten, and he never knew why. In that demonic society where evil people ran rampant, many kind people had similar experiences, and the people's personal freedom was not guaranteed, let alone anything else.

    But now, this same Yang Hong, due to his upright character and enthusiasm for work, is respected by the people. He has taken on the work of a people's assessor. He cited a recent civil case he assisted in judging to illustrate his work. Before the trial, the court introduced the case. The plaintiff was the Beijing Automobile First Repair and Tire Repair Production Cooperative. This production cooperative accepted the repair work of a car belonging to the Xinshiqu District United Cooperative in this city. This production cooperative hired the defendant, Zhang Guiyun, to repair the engine cradle. Zhang Guiyun didn't know how to do it, and as a result, he did it badly. However, both the plaintiff and the defendant installed the engine cradle, trying to deceive the owner. After the owner found out, he had the plaintiff hire someone else to redo it. The plaintiff suffered losses and said that it was the defendant Zhang Guiyun's fault, and demanded that Zhang Guiyun compensate for this loss. After listening to the case, Yang Hong felt unsure and could not determine how to try the case. He thought that the assessor was not just a figurehead and could not be careless and irresponsible. If he did not understand the details of the case during the trial, he could not make a correct judgment. So he proposed to go down and investigate. The court issued a letter of introduction, and at twelve noon that day, he went to the plaintiff's location to conduct investigations and visits, and also looked at the scrap materials. At the time of the trial, the defendant Zhang Guiyun initially did not admit that he was responsible. Yang Hong said, "We workers cannot be sloppy in our work. If you do a bad job, of course you are responsible. If you don't know how to do it, you shouldn't take on the job." The defendant Zhang Guiyun was still unwilling to admit his mistake, saying, "I was just copying from others." Yang Hong retorted, "If you're not in this line of work, how can you copy it?" He also explained to Zhang Guiyun: We workers cannot be sloppy in our work. For example, if the engine cradle is made badly and the quality is very poor, you should not deliver the goods with the plaintiff and deceive the owner. Fortunately, it was discovered, otherwise, if an accident occurred with the car carrying people and goods, the responsibility would be even greater." After Yang Hong's patient explanation, Zhang Guiyun truly understood and admitted that he was indeed responsible.

    However, the plaintiff demanded that the defendant bear an equal share of the compensation for the loss, with each party paying 450,000 yuan of the 900,000 yuan loss. Yang Hong believed this was unreasonable. When discussing how to judge the case with the judge, he gave reasons, saying: "The plaintiff signed a contract with the owner, and the plaintiff hired an outsider to do the work, which is a major responsibility; knowing that it was not done well, but not redoing it, and still wanting to deceive the owner, this is even more to blame. It is wrong to have Zhang Guiyun compensate for half of the loss, as this would not distinguish the primary and secondary responsibilities." As a result of the discussion, it was jointly decided that Zhang Guiyun should compensate 250,000 yuan for the rework cost, about a quarter of the total. Finally, the judgment was written. But at that time, Yang Hong forgot to sign it, and the court specially sent someone back with the judgment for him to sign. Speaking of this, Yang Hong suddenly turned to me and asked, "Do you know where this right comes from?" He immediately and solemnly answered himself: "This is what the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to fight for!"

    人民陪审员杨宏
    赵威侯
    各级人民法院审判案件依照法律实行人民陪审员制度。
    ——中华人民共和国宪法草案第七十五条
    北京市前门区建筑业工作委员会主任、前门区人民代表大会代表、油漆工杨宏，在不久以前，被推选为前门区人民法院的陪审员。宪法草案公布以后，一个偶然的机会，我会见了他，并听他谈到担任人民陪审员以来的感想。
    杨宏把人民法院实行人民陪审员制度看得十分重要。他认为实行人民陪审员制度不但可以把案件审理得更好，特别重要的，是这种制度充分表现了人民是国家的主人翁。
    杨宏今年五十一岁。他和其他劳动人民一样，在旧社会受尽反动统治者及其爪牙的欺凌。在那时候，法律是劳动人民的枷锁，法院是专为镇压人民而设立的。人民的人权随时都会受到侵犯。杨宏从十五岁起就当了油漆工。那时候作这行手艺，并不是天天有工可做。好的时候，每年也不过有七、八个月的活，稍微差点，逢年过节，就要当卖东西。在日本侵略者占领北京的一年，他没有活干，拉了三个月的排子车。有一天，他正拉着车子穿过马路，警察说他拉得慢了，朝着他的肩上就是一木棍。警察、宪兵、特务，随便打人，那时是常有的事。一九四八年北京解放前夕，杨宏又长期没有活做。他和师弟王文斌靠卖水果糖勉强过日子，一天，他正在东单栖凤楼西口，忽然瞧见有许多人围起王文斌。他赶过去一看，只见一个伪军揪着王文斌的后领，另一个伪军捉着他的胳臂，连推带拉带走了。王文斌瞧见杨宏，像见了亲人，大声急喊道：“大哥！你快给我家里捎个信吧！”杨宏想弄清楚到底是怎么会事，就紧跟着走，最后看见王文斌被带到一个大院子里。杨宏刚要往回奔，才不几步，迎面一个便衣特务横道拦住，冲他问道：“干什么的！”他答说是卖糖的，刚才被捕的那人是师弟，想知道是怎么回事。那个特务不由他分说，把他也带进了大院。他一进院，就听见里屋吵吵嚷嚷，发出劈劈拍拍的打嘴巴的声音，王文斌哑着嗓子在呼唤。他知道王文斌挨打了。不多一会，一个军官模样的人从里屋出来，指着他问：“这是谁？”特务回答说：“是一道的！”军官说：“全不是好东西！给我打！”那个军官说完这话就走了，里面又出来一个人，盘问了他一阵，随后把他放走了。王文斌挨关了一夜，他家里花钱请了客，才被放了出来。释放时，那些特务还叫他签名盖章证明他没有挨打。这个随便捉人打人的机关是什么呢？杨宏后来听说，是国民党军队的一个什么后方医院。王文斌被打了一顿，以后他自己也不知道是为了什么。在那恶人横行的鬼蜮社会，多少善良的人们都有相同的遭遇，人民的人身自由毫无保障，更不用说其他了。
    可是现在，就是这同一个杨宏，由于他的正直的为人和对工作的热情，他受到人们的尊敬。他担任了人民陪审员的工作。他举出了一件他最近陪审的民事案件来说明他的工作情况。审判之前，法院先介绍案情。原告是北京市汽车第一修理补胎生产合作社。这个生产合作社接受了本市新市区区联社的一辆汽车的修理工作。这个生产合作社雇了被告张贵云来修理马槽部分。张贵云不会做，结果做坏了。但原被告双方把马槽装好，想蒙混车主。车主查出后，让原告另外雇工重新做过。原告受了损失，说这是被告张贵云做错的，要求张贵云赔偿这种损失。杨宏听了案情，心里没有底，不能确定如何审理这个案件。他想，陪审员不是摆设，不能马马虎虎不负责任。如果在审判时不了解详细的案情，就作不出正确的判决。于是他提出要下去调查研究一番。法院开了介绍信，当天中午十二点钟，他就到原告地点，进行调查访问，又看了看废料。到开庭时，被告张贵云起初不承认自己有责任。杨宏说：“咱们工人做事不能马虎。把工作做坏了，当然有责任。如果自己不会作，就不应当承担。”被告张贵云还不愿意承认错误，说：“我是照猫画虎。”杨宏反驳说：“你不是这一行的，怎能画得成呢？”他并且向张贵云解释说：我们工人作事情一点也不能马虎。比如把马槽作坏了，质量很差，就不应该随着原告交货，欺蒙车主。幸亏是发现了，不然的话，汽车装人载货，一旦发生事故，责任就更大了。”经过杨宏的耐心解释，张贵云真正想通了，承认自己确有责任。
    可是原告要求和被告平均负担赔偿的损失，九十万元损失费每方出四十五万元。杨宏认为这不合理。在和审判员共同讨论如何判决时，他提出理由说：“原告和车主订立了合同，而原告雇了外行人来承做，就有很大责任；明知道没有做好，而不返工重做，还想哄瞒车主，这更要负主要责任。让张贵云赔偿一半的损失，是不对的，那样就分不清责任的主要次要。”讨论结果，共同决定张贵云赔偿返工工价二十五万元，约四分之一强。最后，判决书写成了。但当时杨宏忘记了签名，法院还特地派人送回判决书请他签名。杨宏谈到这里，他突然朝我问道：“你知道这种权利是那里来的？”他立刻又严肃地自己回答说：“这是中国共产党和毛主席领导我们争取来的！”
