The people in the revolutionary cradle of the Jinggang Mountains are actively participating in the discussion and promotion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. As early as the end of June, farmer propagandists and rural theater troupe actors in the Jinggang Mountains area gathered at the location of the Jinggang Mountains District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to discuss the specific content of the Draft Constitution and its close relationship with every farmer in detail, line by line and word by word. Subsequently, the publicity campaign for the Draft Constitution gradually deepened in the four townships and twenty-seven natural villages under the jurisdiction of the Jinggang Mountains area. Farmers held various forms of discussion meetings on the Draft Constitution. Nine mutual aid teams in six natural villages, including Da, Xiao Wujing, and Jingzhushan in Dajing Township, have generally held more than ten discussions.

People's enthusiasm for participating in the discussion of the Draft Constitution is very high. Discussion meetings held by many mutual aid teams often lasted until late at night, and the speeches were always enthusiastic. Zou Shaogang, the captain of the Young Pioneers in Dajing Township during the Second Revolutionary Civil War and now the chairman of the Farmers' Association of Dajing Township, told reporters: The goals that the people of the Jinggang Mountains have strived for through decades of hard work have been explicitly written into the Draft Constitution, how can we not be happy? We must carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the people of the Jinggang Mountains, conscientiously participate in the discussion and publicity work of the Draft Constitution, and conscientiously do a good job in agricultural production and other rural work in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution after it is officially promulgated.

In the activities of discussing and promoting the Draft Constitution, many old Red Army soldiers and former workers of the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government during the Second Revolutionary Civil War showed great political enthusiasm. Together with the young farmers in the village, they disregarded the high mountains and long roads, and took time out of their work to go to their respective electoral districts to carry out publicity to elderly farmers who had difficulty moving in the deep mountains. Yu Zhenkun, a member of the mutual aid team in Jingzhushan electoral district of Dajing Township, who was a staff member of the former Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government, had to walk more than thirty miles of mountain road to attend a discussion meeting in the township. This revolutionary elder was always full of energy, and he was always the first to arrive at every meeting. Young people respectfully called him the "leader in discussing and promoting the Draft Constitution."

The discussion and publicity activities of the Draft Constitution greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the people of the Jinggang Mountains to organize and develop production. Zou Wengyao, an old Red Army soldier from Dajing Township, described the several major changes that the people of the Jinggang Mountains have experienced over the past few decades at a discussion meeting on the Draft Constitution jointly held by the mutual aid team he participated in and another mutual aid team. The facts experienced by many farmers personally inspired the members of the mutual aid team's confidence in building a socialist society. All members of the two groups of mutual aid teams unanimously agreed to merge these two mutual aid teams into an agricultural production cooperative after the autumn harvest. At present, more than 5,000 mu of late rice in the Jinggang Mountains area are budding and heading. Under the leadership of the mutual aid teams, the farmers are actively weeding, applying topdressing fertilizer, and preventing various natural disasters, striving to increase rice production by 10 percent this year on the basis of a 12 percent increase in late rice production last year.

In discussing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the people of Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province—the hometown of Chairman Mao—proposed to express their heartfelt support for the Draft Constitution with actions to increase grain production. On July 30, Shaoshan Township held its second township People's Congress meeting. At the meeting, the people's representatives discussed the Draft Constitution and made a resolution to support it. In order to express their support for the Draft Constitution, to support national construction, and to compensate for the losses in the flood-stricken areas, the meeting also passed a resolution to increase the township's rice production by another 101,000 jin. The proposal to increase grain production by 170,000 jin passed at the previous township People's Congress meeting was revised to increase production by 271,000 jin. Liu Xiuhua, a township People's Representative and the female director of the Shaoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative, said: "Our People's Government has always paid attention to protecting the rights of our women and has always encouraged our farmers to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Now these are all stipulated in the Draft Constitution, and I strongly support them. I am determined to implement the resolutions of the township People's Congress meeting and lead our agricultural production cooperative to overfulfill the production increase plan as a practical action to support the Draft Constitution." Su Fuquan, a township People's Representative and leader of a mutual aid team, said: The current country belongs to the people, and the Draft Constitution stipulates that all power belongs to the people. We must consolidate these achievements, and we can only do so by working hard to increase production. I fully support the resolution to increase grain production by another 101,000 jin. After the closing of the township People's Congress meeting, the farmers of Shaoshan Township discussed ways to complete the task of increasing grain production. They plan to apply a topdressing fertilizer to more than 500 mu of intercropped late rice fields, try planting more than 130 mu of continuous cropping late rice after the harvest of mid-season rice, and retain and plant regenerated rice in more than 300 mu of fields; in addition, they will increase the planting of rapeseed, buckwheat, and other crops by more than 400 mu. This will ensure that there is not a single mu of idle land in the autumn. Now, the early rice in Shaoshan Township is about to be harvested, and the farmers throughout the township are preparing to sell all the early rice to the state, except for the seeds to be retained, in order to support national construction.

    井冈山区人民受到了宪法草案的鼓舞
    韶山乡人民以增产粮食的行动拥护宪法草案
    革命摇篮井冈山区人民积极参加中华人民共和国宪法草案的讨论和宣传活动。早在六月底，井冈山区的农民宣传员和农村剧团的演员们就集中在中共井冈山区委员会所在地，逐条、逐句地讨论了宪法草案的具体内容和与每个农民群众的切身关系。随后，宪法草案的宣传活动便在井冈山区所属的四个乡、二十七个自然村逐步深入展开。农民们分别举行了各种形式的宪法草案讨论会。大井乡的大、小五井和荆竹山等六个自然村的九个互助组，大都已连续讨论了十次以上。
    人们参加讨论宪法草案的热情很高。许多互助组举行的讨论会常常进行到深夜，发言也始终很热烈。第二次国内革命战争时期的大井乡少年先锋队队长、现任大井乡农民协会主席的邹少垣对记者说：井冈山区人民艰苦奋斗几十年所争取的目标已经明文写在宪法草案上，我们怎能不高兴？我们一定要发扬井冈山区人民光荣的革命传统，认真参加宪法草案的讨论和宣传工作，并且在宪法正式公布后要按照宪法的精神认真做好农业生产和其他农村工作。
    在讨论和宣传宪法草案的活动中，许多第二次国内革命战争时期的红军老战士和前工农民主政府的工作人员都表现了极大的政治热情。他们和村里的青年农民一道，不顾山高路远，抽出工余时间到自己所属的选区，向深山里行动不便的老年农民进行宣传。大井乡荆竹山选区前工农民主政府的工作人员、六十多岁的互助组组员余振坤，到乡里参加一次讨论会往返要走三十多里山路，这位革命老人却始终精神饱满，并且每次开会都是他到得最早，青年人都尊敬地称呼他是“讨论和宣传宪法草案的带头人”。
    宪法草案的讨论和宣传活动，大大鼓舞了井冈山区人民组织起来发展生产的热情。大井乡红军老战士邹文耀在他所参加的互助组和另一个互助组联合举行的一次宪法草案讨论会上，叙述了井冈山区人民几十年来所经历的几次大变化。从许多农民亲身体验的事实中激发了互助组组员们建设社会主义社会的信心。两个组的全体互助组员一致同意在秋后把这两个互助组合并成立一个农业生产合作社。目前井冈山区五千多亩晚稻正在孕苞抽穗，农民群众正在互助组的带头下积极进行耘禾、施追肥、预防各种自然灾害的侵袭，争取在去年晚稻增产百分之十二的基础上今年增产稻谷百分之十。

    毛主席故乡——湖南省湘潭县韶山乡人民在讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案中，提出要以增产粮食的行动表达他们衷心拥护宪法草案的心情。七月三十日，韶山乡举行了第二次乡人民代表大会会议。会上，人民代表们讨论了宪法草案，并作出了拥护宪法草案的决议。为了表达对宪法草案的拥护，为了支援国家建设和补偿受水灾地区的损失，会议同时通过了全乡再增产稻谷十万一千斤的决议。把上一次乡人民代表大会会议通过的增产十七万斤粮食的议案，修改为增产二十七万一千斤。乡人民代表、韶山农业生产合作社女社长刘秀华说：“我们的人民政府一直注意保护我们妇女的权利，也一直鼓励我们农民走互助合作的道路。现在这些都在宪法草案中作了规定，我非常拥护，决心贯彻乡人民代表大会会议的决议，领导我们农业生产合作社超额完成增产计划，作为拥护宪法草案的实际行动。” 乡人民代表、互助组长苏福全说：现在的国家是人民的，宪法草案上规定一切权力属于人民。我们要巩固这些成果，就只有努力增产。我完全拥护再增产十万一千斤粮食的决议。在乡人民代表大会会议闭幕以后，韶山乡农民纷纷讨论完成增产粮食的办法。他们准备在五百多亩间作晚稻田中普遍追一次肥，并在中稻收割后，试种一百三十多亩连作晚稻，并在三百多亩田里留植再生稻；此外还增种油菜、荞麦等作物四百多亩。这就使秋季无一亩闲地。现在，韶山乡的早稻即将收割，全乡农民都准备除了留作种籽外，将全部早稻出售给国家，以支援国家建设。　（新华社）
