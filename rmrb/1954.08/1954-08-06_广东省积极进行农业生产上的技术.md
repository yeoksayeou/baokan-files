    Guangdong Province Actively Undertakes Technological Reform in Agricultural Production
    In order to increase the yield per unit area of farmland, Guangdong Province is preparing to actively carry out technological reforms in agricultural production on the basis of the development of the cooperative movement. In carrying out technological reforms, different measures are adopted according to different regions. In the Pearl River Delta paddy field area, the key to increasing production is to change double-cropping intercropping into double-cropping continuous cropping and to implement appropriate close planting. According to existing experience, paddy fields reformed in this way can double the yield per unit area. To this end, the province has established a Paddy Field Working Committee, specializing in the technical reform of paddy field agricultural production, so that the potential of the province's four million mu of paddy fields can be fully realized. In order to strengthen the guidance of agricultural production technology, agricultural technology extension stations will be generally established in each county this year. Next year, about 30 percent of districts are required to establish stations, and three to seven farmer technicians who do not leave production will be gradually trained in each agricultural production cooperative. The province will strengthen the leadership of eight intermediate agricultural technical schools to prepare cadres for the long-term construction of agricultural production. At present, four representative agricultural technology reform demonstration areas have been established throughout the province. Each demonstration area has a technology extension station, and each is equipped with 20 specialized technical cadres in grain, specialty products, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, and pest and disease control. It is required that on the basis of promoting the development of cooperation, the work of various agricultural technology reforms should be summarized, improved, and promoted.

    广东省积极进行农业生产上的技术改革
    广东省为了提高农田单位面积产量，准备在合作化运动发展的基础上积极进行农业生产的技术改革。在进行技术改革中，按照不同地区采取不同的措施。在珠江平原沙田水稻区的增产关键是把双季间作改为双季连作，并实行适当密植。根据已有经验，经过这样改革的沙田，单位面积产量可增加一倍。为此，该省已成立沙田工作委员会，专管沙田农业生产的技术改革工作，使全省四百万亩沙田的潜力得以充分发挥。为了加强农业生产技术的指导，今年各县将普遍建立农业技术推广站，明年要求有百分之三十左右的区建站，并将逐步训练每个农业生产合作社三个到七个不脱离生产的农民技术人员。该省将加强对八个中级农业技术学校的领导，为农业生产的长期建设准备好干部。目前，在全省建立了四个有代表性的农业技术改革示范区，各示范区均设立技术推广站，并均配备有粮食、特产、畜牧、兽医、病虫害防治等专门技术干部二十人。要求在促进合作化发展的基础上，总结提高并推广各项农业技术改革工作。
