Farmers in various parts of Shanxi Province are actively using floodwater to irrigate autumn crops this year. As of mid-August, incomplete statistics from 25 counties including Qingxu, Hongdong, Xin County, Xinjiang, and Fenyang show that a total of 800,000 mu of autumn crops have been irrigated. The irrigated autumn crops are growing particularly well. Based on past years' yields, it is estimated that crops irrigated with floodwater can increase grain production by an average of 80 jin per mu, resulting in a total increase of more than 64 million jin of grain. This year, the Jinzhong Fen River irrigation area also implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, with an average irrigation depth not exceeding two centimeters, completely changing the past method of flooding large areas. This not only avoids damaging the seedlings but also allows farmers to go to the fields for weeding and soil loosening four to five days after irrigation. Mountainous area residents have also begun to use mountain floods to irrigate fields. In Xiaoping Township, Lingchuan County, the Yuan Yingui and Qin Qunsong agricultural production cooperatives, which had never used floodwater for irrigation before, also used mountain floods to irrigate 288 mu of autumn fields this year. This also protected 1,600 mu of seedlings downstream from being washed away and submerged by mountain floods. At present, irrigation areas throughout the province and mountainous area residents are still working hard to continue using floodwater for irrigation to ensure the overfulfillment of the grain production increase plan.

    山西省农民利用洪水浇灌秋禾八十万亩
    山西各地农民今年积极利用洪水浇灌秋禾。到八月中旬止，据清徐、洪洞、忻县、新绛、汾阳等二十五县不完全统计，共已浇灌秋禾八十万亩。浇灌过的秋禾都长得特别好，按往年的产量估计，用洪水浇灌的庄稼每亩平均能增产粮食八十斤，共可增产六千四百多万斤粮食。晋中汾河浇灌区今年还贯彻了苏联专家的建议，平均灌洪不超过两公寸；彻底改变了过去大水漫浇的办法。这不但免除了淹害禾苗，而且灌后四五天就可以下地锄田松土。山地群众也开始利用山洪浇田。陵川县小坪乡袁银贵、秦群松两个农业生产合作社，过去从未有利用洪水浇田的习惯，今年也用山洪浇了二百八十八亩秋田。并且保障了下游一千六百亩禾苗免遭山洪冲毁和淹没。目前，全省各灌溉区及山地群众仍在紧张的继续利用洪水浇地，保证超额完成增产粮食的计划。（本报山西记者站）
