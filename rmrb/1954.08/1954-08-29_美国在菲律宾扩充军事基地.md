Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: U.S. military authorities, who are constantly expanding military bases in the Philippines, are preparing to expand San Fernando Airport, about 250 kilometers north of Manila, into a base for long-range bombers. Agence France-Presse, citing the Philippine News Agency on the 27th, said that in order to implement this aggressive military base expansion plan, the U.S. military authorities have requested a large amount of land near San Fernando town on the northwest coast of Luzon Island from the Philippine Magsaysay government. The Magsaysay government decided last week to meet the U.S. military authorities' land requirements for expanding military bases and is preparing to supply the land to the United States by means of a lease.

The report said that U.S. military authorities had surveyed a vast area including thirteen villages near San Fernando town. Residents now living within a radius of one mile centered on San Fernando Airport have received orders to move out.

The report also said that the airport expansion project is expected to begin soon. The expanded airport will be called Wallace Airport and will become an auxiliary airport to Clark Air Base (80 kilometers north of Manila), the main U.S. military airport in the Philippines.

    美国在菲律宾扩充军事基地
    【新华社二十八日讯】在菲律宾不断扩大军事基地的美国军事当局，正在准备把马尼拉以北约二百五十公里的仙彬兰洛机场扩建作长距离轰炸机的基地。法新社二十七日引菲律宾通讯社的消息说，美国军事当局为了执行这一项侵略性的扩充军事基地计划，已经向菲律宾麦格赛赛政府索取在吕宋岛西北海岸仙彬兰洛镇附近的大片土地。麦格赛赛政府上星期已决定满足美国军事当局关于扩建军事基地的土地要求，并准备用租让的方式将土地供给美国。
    消息说，美国军事当局曾经在仙彬兰洛镇附近测量了包括有十三个村庄的广阔地区。现在居住在以仙彬兰洛机场为中心的半径一英里范围内的居民，已经接到强制搬家的命令。
    消息并说，这项机场扩建工程预料不久就要开始。扩建后的机场将叫作华莱斯机场，它将成为美军在菲律宾的主要机场克拉克基地（在马尼拉以北八十公里）的辅助机场。
