    Indonesian Official Tells "Social Messenger" Reporter that Indonesia Refuses to Join the Southeast Asia Aggression Bloc Planned by the United States
      Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 3rd: A well-informed Indonesian official told a reporter from the "Social Messenger" on the 2nd that Indonesia's attitude of refusing to participate in any military pact remains unchanged. Because the "defense" pact for Southeast Asia proposed by the United States is of a military nature, Indonesia will refuse to participate in such a pact.
      The "Social Messenger" said in an editorial on the 2nd that the United States and its allies are pushing forward with the conclusion of a Southeast Asia military pact. Participation in such a pact would make them enemies of the Soviet Union and its allies. The newspaper warned the United States not to invite Indonesia, as Indonesia will refuse to participate in such a pact.
