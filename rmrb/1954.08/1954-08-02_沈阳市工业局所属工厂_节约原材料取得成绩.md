Factories under the Shenyang Municipal Industry Bureau have implemented savings on twelve types of raw materials, and it is estimated that they can save 2.55 billion yuan worth of wealth this year.

Since the second quarter of this year, after the Municipal Industry Bureau strengthened its leadership in material management in various factories, the factories began to pay attention to saving raw materials. For example, the Weighing Instrument Factory established a batching workshop in the material warehouse and implemented nesting cutting, which resulted in a decrease in product costs. The cost of a 100-ton rail scale was more than 50 million yuan lower than the planned cost. The shoe factory also implemented reasonable cutting, cutting large pieces first and small pieces later, without leaving any scraps, basically achieving the goal of using large materials for large purposes and small materials for small purposes. The cost in April was 1.55% lower than planned, and in May it was 3.14% lower. Since the Auto Repair Factory established a raw material requisition and return system and strengthened storage work, it has reduced the waste and loss of raw materials. The cost in May was 34% lower than the previous month.

At the same time, many factories have begun to use waste materials. The Small Hardware Factory used waste materials to replace specification steel and strip steel to make cotter pins. By making only three specifications of cotter pins, such as four, five, and six, it saved 1.42 billion yuan compared to using good materials. The Brewery used waste bark to make packaging boxes and scrap iron corners from the Enamel Factory to make bottle caps. In addition, boiler workers burned coal slime, eggshells, and straw, saving a total of more than 935 million yuan this year. The workers at the Plumbing Equipment Factory found that the furnace ash was too heavy when dumping it, so they washed it with water. In May alone, they washed out 40 tons of scrap iron.

    节约原材料取得成绩
    沈阳市工业局所属工厂已在十二种原材料上实行节约，预计今年可节省二十五亿五千万元的财富。
    从今年第二季度开始，市工业局加强对各厂的材料管理的领导以后，各厂就开始注意节约原材料。如衡器厂在材料仓库成立了配料车间，实行了套裁，结果产品成本下降，一台一百吨的轨道衡比计划成本降低五千多万元。制鞋厂也实行了合理剪裁，大件先裁，小件后裁，不剩零料，基本上做到大材大用，小材小用，四月份成本比计划降低百分之一·五五，五月份降低百分之三·一四。汽车修配厂自从建立了原材料的领退制度，加强保管工作以后，减少了原料的浪费和损失，五月份成本较前一个月降低了百分之三十四。
    同时，有很多工厂开始使用废料。小五金厂利用废料代替规格钢和带钢做插肖，仅做四、五、六等三种规格的插肖，就比用好料节省了十四亿两千万元。酿造厂利用废板皮做包装用的箱子，用珐琅厂的废铁角做瓶盖，再加上锅炉工人烧煤泥，烧鸡蛋壳和稻草等废物，今年共可节约九亿三千五百余万元。水暖器材厂的工人在倒炉灰时，发现炉灰过重，就用水洗，仅五月份就洗出四十吨碎铁来。
