Why is the Construction Preparation Work Not Done Well?
    Fan Rongkang

    At the beginning of this year, I visited the basic construction departments of several central industrial ministries and asked comrades from these departments to talk about their estimates for this year's basic construction work. At that time, their common refrain was: "This year, the construction preparation work is being done earlier and better than last year..."

    In July, I visited these basic construction departments again. Their language was still consistent, but the content had changed: "It seems that this year's construction preparation work is still not being done well..."

    What is the reason for this? Was the initial estimate wrong?

      "No," a comrade from the Basic Construction Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building explained to me: "This year's construction preparation work is indeed better than last year's. Let's recall what the situation was last year. Last year, we felt that our strength was insufficient, materials were lacking, blueprints couldn't arrive, and advance payments couldn't be obtained. How passive our work was! The situation is different this year. Our strength is generally sufficient. Except for individual projects, the arrival of blueprints, especially foreign design blueprints, is also relatively good. We also have materials and money. We can't deny that there has been great progress in construction preparation work. So, where is the problem? The problem lies in the fact that this year's project objects are different. Last year, we did more general civil construction projects. Even if we did some industrial construction projects, they were all foundation projects or relatively simple projects. This year is different. Investment is concentrated, project structures are complex, and they are all important industrial construction projects. For example, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant: last year, it was just the foundation work for a few workshops; this year, it is fully operational. In the face of such complex industrial construction projects, our construction preparation work is still not commensurate, hence the saying: it is still not being done well."

    Then, he talked about the chassis workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.

    The chassis workshop project accounts for 54% of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's planned workload for the first quarter. The detailed steel structure drawings for this project arrived last year. According to the supply department's inspection, the quantity and specifications of steel in stock in 1953 could meet the needs of the chassis workshop. One can imagine that there was optimism about the chassis workshop: "The drawings arrived early, and we have the steel. What else is there to worry about?"

    Later facts proved that, for an industrial construction project, such optimism was premature. They neglected an important stipulation in the detailed construction drawings: all steel must be made of open-hearth A-group steel. They did not check whether the steel in stock was open-hearth steel, and whether the grade and quality met the design requirements. On February 27th, the East China Steel Construction Plant, which contracted for the chassis workshop project, discovered that the steel in stock did not meet the requirements. On March 16th, they formally proposed a shortage of 156 tons of steel. Only then did the supply department temporarily go out to purchase it. The steel was bought back, but after testing, it still did not meet the specifications. Later, they rushed to find goods in Shenyang, Dalian, Qiqihar, and other places. The chassis workshop was delayed until May 4th before construction began. Because the chassis workshop did not start on schedule, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's construction plan for the first quarter fell short. Although six unplanned projects were temporarily added, only about 60% of the quarterly plan was completed.

    The fact that the chassis workshop could not start on schedule illustrates that, for an industrial construction project, merely having blueprints and materials, merely doing general construction preparation work, is not enough. Just this one steel problem not only disrupted the chassis workshop's plan, but also affected the progress of many projects at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.

    A deputy manager of the Central Construction Engineering Ministry's Directly Subordinate Engineering Company, which is undertaking the civil construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, also mentioned the steel problem that had been troubling them for a long time at a meeting. He said: "We have over 10,000 tons of steel in our warehouses. It seems that the preparation of steel is sufficient. However, the steel problem constantly makes us nervous, constantly forces us to take emergency measures, and constantly affects our construction. Last year, in June and July, we thought that the scientific testing of steel was at most a tensile test. But Soviet experts said that tensile tests alone were not enough; chemical and physical tests were also required. This testing delayed the construction of the reinforcing steel plant by a month. In February and March of this year, Soviet experts pointed out that steel that was not produced in batches and did not have ex-warehouse certificates could not be simply spot-checked; every piece had to be tested. This caused another round of tension. Five or six thousand pieces of steel were bought from the market and hardware companies, and each one had to undergo a chemical test and two physical tests. When would the testing be completed? Later, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee mobilized all the testing institutions in Shenyang, which were busy for a whole month. In April, the Soviet experts for the thermal power plant project requested open-hearth steel, but we didn't know which was open-hearth steel and which was Bessemer steel. The thermal power plant project had to be suspended for two weeks. Recently, it was discovered that the metal structure drawings for the pressing workshop stipulated that all steel must undergo cold bending tests. This was also the first time we had heard of it..."

    Steel is just one item in the material supply work, and the material supply work is only one part of the construction preparation work. However, just from this steel problem alone, one can see the complexity of industrial construction projects, and one can see that if we use the standards for measuring general civil construction to treat the construction preparation work for industrial construction projects, we will inevitably make mistakes.

    Regrettably, not only do some people ignore the complexity of industrial construction and treat the construction preparation work for industrial construction in the same way as civil construction, but also some people rush to construction when the construction conditions are not available. The open-hearth workshop project of the Daye Steel Plant of the Central China Iron and Steel Company is an example.

    The open-hearth workshop is the key project of the Daye Steel Plant this year. Many reports about this project have already appeared in the newspapers, and the slogan "Everything for the opening of the open-hearth furnace on June 1st" has also been put forward.

    The Central China Iron and Steel Company is well aware of the significance of this project and is determined to complete it well. However, because the Central China Iron and Steel Company is a newly formed unit and lacks experience in complex industrial construction, the construction preparation work was not well organized. By the end of May, the conditions for the opening of the open-hearth workshop were very strained, and the on-site facilities were not complete. The construction force was only gathered in the second half of April, and the construction organization design was rushed to completion on the eve of the start of construction. Problems such as transportation, drainage, water supply, and construction machinery were not completely solved. Taking the foundation project as an example, for the first step of excavation, light rails were not laid, and the excavated earth could not be transported out. If the first step of the process could be completed on schedule, the second step of pile driving would be delayed. For example, with the waterproofing problem, there was a shortage of waterway equipment, a shortage of waterproof steel plates, and a shortage of waterproof welders...

    Under these circumstances, just to realize the slogan that had been put forward, the construction of the open-hearth workshop of the Daye Steel Plant was barely started. If the on-site project had not been hindered by rainwater, delaying the progress and allowing the construction preparation work to catch up, the construction of the open-hearth workshop project would not have been able to continue.

    The start of construction of the open-hearth workshop of the Daye Steel Plant has been called a symbolic start. The Central China Iron and Steel Company has learned many lessons from this. These lessons are important for all basic construction cadres. Because examples like the open-hearth workshop of the Daye Steel Plant are by no means isolated. Some of our cadres often, in order to "overcome idling," disregard whether the construction preparation work is done well and whether the construction conditions are complete, and issue an order to break ground. As a result, construction is forced to stop after three or two days, and not only can idling not be overcome, but the chaos on the construction site, various wastes and losses all follow, which is not necessarily of much benefit to the progress of the project.

    We also have some cadres who take a passive waiting attitude towards construction preparation work, as if construction conditions are not to be created by the construction enterprise through effort, but should fall from the sky.

    The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is an example. The equipment installation project of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant accounts for 60.4% of the total investment for the year and is the main task for completing the annual plan. Initially, the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant estimated that its technical strength was insufficient and it lacked installation experience. Under the control of the idea of "outsourcing to save trouble," it contracted this project to the Installation Engineering Company of the Northeast Construction Engineering Bureau. Since it was to save effort, after outsourcing, the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant was at ease relying on the contractor. Later, it was discovered that this construction unit had never done machine tool installation projects and had difficulties in contracting. The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant then took back the project to manage it itself. However, they did not become active because of self-management, and began to wait for the support of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Long-term reliance and waiting made them relax the construction preparation work. They did not study the operating procedures and quality standards in advance, and after construction started, there was nothing to follow. The progress plan fell through, and quality accidents were also serious.

    Situations similar to that of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant are very common. They wait for the help of higher authorities, or push things out and wait for fraternal units to solve them. In waiting and reliance, they waste precious time.

    All these attitudes of being satisfied with general preparations in the face of complex industrial construction, all these hasty starts and dependent attitudes towards construction preparation work have all run into walls.

    Facts have proven that construction preparation work for industrial construction is just as complex and is just as arduous an organizational work as construction itself. The process of construction preparation is the process of investigating and studying construction conditions, the process of constantly discovering and breaking through weak links and creating construction conditions, the process of planning construction deployment, deciding on construction methods, site layout, and other major construction principles, and it is also the process of construction and installation enterprises carrying out all necessary ideological, organizational, and technical construction work. If construction preparation work is done well, it will pave a broad road for the entire construction process, and the normal order of construction, and the good, fast, economical, and safe basic construction can all be correspondingly guaranteed. Whoever neglects construction preparation work, starts construction hastily without doing construction preparation work well, whoever only grasps one part of construction preparation work, such as only grasping the organizational construction of construction and installation enterprises and neglecting the overall planning of construction, will inevitably cause chaos, delay progress, and inevitably cause accidents, resulting in irreparable waste.

    Experience tells us that we must recognize the complexity of industrial construction, overcome the ideas of rushing to start work regardless of conditions and waiting and relying without actively preparing, and especially overcome that kind of generalized leadership. Generalized leadership is like this: "Blueprints can arrive in May, and construction will start in July." This kind of generalized leadership that does not make specific analyses and does not carry out all-round balancing sows the seeds of disaster when determining the plan, and there is no possibility of carrying out construction preparation work seriously.

    However, we must not think that the only condition for doing construction preparation work well is to extend the time for construction preparation work and to postpone the start date. The cause of national socialist industrialization does not allow us to move slowly, and the reason why construction preparation work for many projects is not done well is not a matter of time, but a matter of the understanding of construction preparation work and the style of work.

    Can it be said that the construction preparation work for the chassis workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant was not done well because time was tight? No, the detailed construction drawings for the chassis workshop had arrived long ago. The steel problem could have been solved earlier. Although the start date of construction of the open-hearth workshop of the Daye Steel Plant ultimately became a matter worth considering, it would not necessarily have become a matter worth considering if the construction preparation work had been well organized. As for the fact that the operating procedures and quality standards for the equipment installation project of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant were not formulated for a long time, apart from the fact that they stagnated in waiting and reliance, they cannot be blamed on the lack of time.

    Also, we must not think that so-called doing construction preparation work well means solving all the problems in the entire construction process. Because the project has not yet started, and because the construction conditions will continue to change, it is impossible to foresee all the problems in the entire construction process during the construction preparation work stage. Therefore, we must not require construction preparation work to replace the organizational management work of the entire construction process and solve all the problems in the entire construction process.

    Finally, we cannot think that construction preparation work is only a matter of a few months, and we cannot think that we can abandon construction preparation work after a large number of projects have started, because basic construction projects are constantly starting, which requires us to constantly do a good job in the construction preparation work for new projects.

    为什么施工准备工作做得不好
    范荣康
    今年年初，我曾经访问过中央几个工业部的基本建设部门，请这些部门的同志谈谈对今年基本建设工作的估计。那时候，他们共同的语言是：“今年施工准备工作做得比去年早，也做得比去年好……”
    七月里，我再一次访问这些基本建设部门，他们的语言还是一致的，但内容变了：“看来，今年的施工准备工作还是做得不好的……”
    这是什么原因呢？难道年初的估计是错误的吗？
      “不，”第一机械工业部基本建设司的同志向我解释道：“今年的施工准备工作是比去年做得好的。可以回忆一下，去年是什么情况呢？去年，我们感到力量不足，材料不够，图纸来不了，预付款拿不到，工作是多么被动呵！今年的情况不同了。力量一般是够的，除了个别的工程外，图纸到达的情况，特别是国外设计图纸到达的情况也是比较好的，材料也有，钱也有，施工准备工作不能不说有很大的进步。那么，问题在什么地方呢？问题就在于今年的工程对象不同了。去年，我们做得多的，还是一般的民用建筑工程，即便做些工业建设工程，也都是基础工程，或者是比较简单的工程，今年不同了，投资集中，工程结构复杂，而且都是重要的工业建设工程。例如第一汽车制造厂，去年只是几个车间的基础工程，今年全面开工。在这样复杂的工业建设工程面前，我们的施工准备工作仍然是不相适应的，因而说：还是做得不好的。”
    接着，他谈起第一汽车制造厂的底盘车间。
    底盘车间的工程占第一汽车制造厂第一季度计划工作量的百分之五十四。这个工程的钢结构施工详图在去年就已经来到，据供应处的检查，一九五三年库存钢材的数量和粗细都能满足底盘车间的需要。可以想见，底盘车间曾经是令人乐观的：“图纸早到了，钢材也有了，还有什么问题呢？”
    后来的事实证明，对于一个工业建设工程，这种乐观还太早。他们忽略了施工详图的一项重要规定：全部钢材都要采用钢三平炉A组钢，他们没有去检查库存的钢材是否是钢三，是否是平炉钢，标号，质量是否合乎设计要求。二月二十七日，承包底盘车间工程的华东钢铁建筑厂，发现库存钢材不合要求，三月十六日正式提出缺少钢材一百五十六吨。供应处这才临时出外采买。钢材买回来了，但经过化验，还是不合规格。后来，又赶到沈阳、大连、齐齐哈尔等地找货，底盘车间就这样一直拖到五月四日才开工。由于底盘车间没有按期开工，第一汽车制造厂第一季度的施工计划落了空，虽然临时把六项计划外的工程补上来，也只完成季度计划的百分之六十几。
    底盘车间不能按期开工的事实说明：一个工业建设工程，仅仅有了图纸，有了材料，仅仅是一般地做了施工准备工作，是不够的。就这一个钢材问题，不仅打破了底盘车间的计划，而且影响过第一汽车制造厂许多工程的进行。
    承建第一汽车制造厂土建工程的中央建筑工程部直属工程公司的一位副经理，在一次会议上也曾谈起长期苦恼着他们的钢材问题。他说：“在我们的仓库里，积压了一万多吨钢材。看来，钢材的准备是很够了。可是，钢材问题却使我们不断的紧张，不断地采取紧急措施，并且不断地影响我们的施工。去年六、七月，我们以为钢材的科学试验顶多是拉力试验，但苏联专家说，光是拉力试验是不够的，还要进行化学试验和物理试验。这一试验，钢筋厂的建设拖了一个月。今年二、三月，苏联专家指出，不是成批出厂的，没有出库证件的钢材，光是抽查还不行，每一根都要进行试验。这一下又紧张了，从市面上和五金公司买来的钢材有五、六千根，每根都进行一次化学试验，两次物理试验，要试验到什么时候呢？后来，东北财政经济委员会动员了沈阳所有的试验机构，足足忙了一个月。四月里，热电站工程的苏联专家提出要平炉钢的钢材，可是我们不知道那是平炉钢，那是贝氏炉钢，热电站的工程不得不停工两个星期，最近，又发现压制车间金属结构图纸上规定，全部钢材都要经过冷弯试验，这又是第一次听说的事情……”
    钢材只是材料供应工作的一个项目，材料供应工作也只是施工准备工作的一个部分。但是，仅仅从这个钢材问题上，就可以看到工业建设工程的复杂性，就可以看到，如果用衡量一般民用建筑的标准，来对待工业建设工程的施工准备工作，就不可避免地要犯错误。
    遗憾的是，不仅有人忽视工业建设的复杂性，像对待民用建筑一样，来对待工业建设的施工准备工作。而且还有人在不具备施工条件的时候就仓促施工。华中钢铁公司大冶钢厂平炉车间工程就是一个例子。
    平炉车间是大冶钢厂今年的重点工程。关于这个工程，报纸上已经作了许多宣传，“一切为了六月一日平炉开工”的口号也提出去了。
    华中钢铁公司深知这项工程的意义，一心想把工程完成得很好。但是，由于华中钢铁公司是一个新组成的单位，对复杂的工业建设还缺乏经验，施工准备工作没有很好的组织，到五月底，平炉车间开工的条件是十分勉强的，工地的现场设施还不齐全。施工力量在四月下半月才聚集起来，施工组织设计到开工前夕才赶编成功，交通运输、排水、给水、施工机械等问题也没有完全解决。以基础工程做例子，第一步挖土，没有铺好轻便轨道，土方运不出去，如果第一步工序能按期竣工，第二步打桩，预装桩也来不及做。再如防水问题，缺少水道器材，缺少防水层钢板，缺少防水电焊工……
    在这种情况下，只是为了实现既经提出的口号，大冶钢厂平炉车间的工程才勉强开工，要不是现场工程受到雨水的阻碍延缓了进度，使施工准备工作获得新的时间赶上去，平炉车间工程的施工势将不能继续下去。
    大冶钢厂平炉车间的开工，被人称为象征性的开工。华中钢铁公司从这里得到很多教训。这些教训对所有的基本建设干部都是重要的。因为像大冶钢厂平炉车间这样的例子绝不是个别的。我们有一些干部常常为了“克服窝工”，不顾施工准备工作是否做好，施工条件是否齐备，就一纸命令，破土开工。结果是开工三两天就被迫停工，窝工不但不能克服，施工现场的混乱，各种浪费和损失反都随之而来，对工程的进展并不一定有多大的好处。
    我们也有这样一些干部，他们对施工准备工作采取消极等待的态度，仿佛施工条件不是由建筑企业去努力创造，而是应该由天上掉下来一样。
    沈阳第一机床厂就是一个例子。沈阳第一机床厂设备安装工程占全年投资总额百分之六十点四，是完成全年计划的主要课题。起初，沈阳第一机床厂估计到自己的技术力量不足，缺乏安装经验，在“外包省劲”的思想支配下，就把这项工程包给东北建筑工程局安装工程公司，既然是图省劲，外包之后，沈阳第一机床厂就心安理得地依赖着乙方。后来发现这个施工单位从来没有做过机床安装工程，承包困难，沈阳第一机床厂才把这项工程收回自营。但是，他们并不因为自营而积极起来，又开始等待鞍山钢铁公司的支援。长期的依赖等待使他们放松了施工准备工作，事先对操作规程，质量标准未加研究，开工后无所遵循，进度计划固然落了空，质量事故也很严重。
    类似沈阳第一机床厂这种情况是很普遍的，他们等待上级的帮助，或者把事情推出去，等待兄弟单位解决，在等待依赖中，虚度了宝贵的时间。
    所有这些在复杂的工业建设面前，满足于一般的准备的态度，所有这些仓促开工和对待施工准备工作的依赖态度都已碰了壁。
    事实证明：工业建设的施工准备工作和施工本身同样复杂，同样是一个艰巨的组织工作。施工准备的过程，就是调查和研究施工条件的过程，就是不断发现和突破薄弱环节，创造施工条件的过程，就是规划施工部署，决定施工方法，场地布置等各项施工重大原则的过程，也就是建筑安装企业进行各项必要的思想上，组织上，技术上的建设工作的过程。施工准备工作做好了，就为全部施工过程铺开一条康庄大道，施工的正常秩序，基本建设的好，快，省，安全都可以得到相应的保证。谁要是忽视施工准备工作，没有做好施工准备工作就仓促施工，谁要是只抓住施工准备工作的一个部分，例如只抓住建筑安装企业的组织建设，忽视了施工的总体规划，就必然造成混乱，推迟进度，就必然发生事故，造成不可弥补的浪费。
    经验告诉我们，一定要认识工业建设的复杂性，克服那种不看条件，急于开工和不积极准备的等待依赖思想，特别是要克服那种一般化的领导。一般化的领导是这样的：“图纸五月可到，工程七月开工”。这种不作具体分析，不进行各方面的平衡的一般化的领导，在确定计划时就埋下了祸根，就没有可能认真的进行施工准备工作。
    但是，决不能认为做好施工准备工作的唯一条件，就是延长施工准备工作的时间，就是推迟开工的日期。国家社会主义工业化的事业不允许我们步履迟缓，而且许多工程的施工准备工作做得不好，不是时间问题，而是对待施工准备工作的认识问题和工作作风问题。
    难道可以说第一汽车制造厂底盘车间施工准备工作做得不好是时间局促吗？不是的，底盘车间的施工详图早就来了。钢材问题是可以早一些解决的。大冶钢厂平炉车间的开工日期，虽然在最后成为一个值得考虑的问题，但如果施工准备工作组织得很好，也不一定成为一个值得考虑的问题。至于沈阳第一机床厂设备安装工程的操作规程，质量标准迟迟未能订出，除了他们在等待依赖中停滞不前外，更不能责怪时间短促。
    也决不能认为，所谓做好施工准备工作，就是要解决全部施工过程中的一切问题，由于工程还没有开始，由于施工条件还会不断变化，在施工准备工作阶段是不可能预见到全部施工过程中的一切问题的，因此，决不能要求施工准备工作去代替全部施工过程的组织管理工作，解决全部施工过程中的一切问题。
    最后，不能认为施工准备工作只是某几个月的事，不能认为大量开工后就可以放弃施工准备工作，因为基本建设工程是不断开工的，这就需要我们不断地作好新的工程的施工准备工作。
