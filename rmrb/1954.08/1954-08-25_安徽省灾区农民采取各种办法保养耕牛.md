Farmers in some disaster-stricken areas along the Huai River in Anhui Province, with the strong assistance of the People's Government, are organized to maintain draught cattle. Some disaster-stricken people in Fengtai, Huaiyuan, and other counties are preparing to organize 23,000 head of draught cattle to collectively graze in the Dabie Mountains, Fengyang Mountains, and other areas with abundant pasture. Currently, the first batch of 5,000 cattle has begun to be transferred. In addition, some disaster-stricken people are using the "mutual aid foster care" method to foster draught cattle in agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and farmers' homes in non-disaster areas. The People's Government is also organizing disaster-stricken people who are producing in non-disaster areas to bring draught cattle with them, which is not only conducive to cultivation but also provides conditions for raising draught cattle. Only a portion of the disaster-stricken people in Fengtai County who went to Feidong County for production brought 386 draught cattle with them. For disaster-stricken people who are really unable to raise draught cattle, the government adopts the method of purchasing them, collecting the draught cattle, and organizing grazing.

After some areas along the Huai River were hit by disasters, some farmers had difficulty feeding draught cattle. In order to protect draught cattle and restore production, the Anhui Provincial People's Government quickly instructed various localities to educate disaster-stricken people to try their best to maintain draught cattle, and mobilized state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid groups in non-disaster areas to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and share the burden of fostering draught cattle in disaster areas. At the same time, cadres were sent to find grass sources and organize the transfer of draught cattle to mountainous areas for grazing. Before the transfer, the government sent cadres to investigate and draw routes, set up grass stations along the way, and protect the safe transfer of draught cattle.

The Anhui Provincial People's Government is now organizing veterinarians to go to the concentrated locations of draught cattle to carry out epidemic prevention and hygiene work for draught animals. (Xinhua News Agency)

    安徽省灾区农民采取各种办法保养耕牛
    安徽省沿淮河部分受灾地区的农民，在人民政府大力协助下，有组织地保养耕牛。凤台、怀远等县部分灾民准备组织两万三千头耕牛到大别山、凤阳山等牧草丰富地区集体放牧。目前第一批五千头牛已开始转移。另外，有些灾民运用“互助寄养”办法，把耕牛寄养在非灾区的农业生产合作社、互助组和农民家里。人民政府并组织到非灾区生产的灾民随带耕牛，这样既利于耕种，又有条件饲养耕牛。仅凤台县到肥东县去生产的部分灾民即带去耕牛三百八十六头。对实在无力饲养耕牛的灾民，政府便采取收购的方法，把耕牛收集起来，组织放牧。
    沿淮河部分地区受灾后，部分农民喂养耕牛发生困难。为保护耕牛，恢复生产，安徽省人民政府迅速指示各地，教育灾民尽力设法保养耕牛，并发动非灾区的国营农场、农业生产合作社、互助组带动农民发扬互助互济精神，分担寄养灾区耕牛。同时，派出干部寻找草源，组织耕牛转移到山区放牧。在转移前，政府派干部调查绘制路线，沿途设立草站，保护耕牛安全转移。
    安徽省人民政府现正组织兽医，赴耕牛集中地点开展耕畜防疫卫生工作。　　　　　　（新华社）
