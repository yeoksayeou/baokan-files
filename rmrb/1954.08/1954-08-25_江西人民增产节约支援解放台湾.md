    Jiangxi People Increase Production and Practice Economy to Support the Liberation of Taiwan
    [This newspaper, Nanchang, August 24th] People from all walks of life in Jiangxi Province warmly support the joint declaration by various democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China for the liberation of Taiwan, and are determined to support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions.
    All the workers and staff of Jiangxi and Xin Sheng Textile Factories, after hearing the joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan on the radio, stated that they would economize on the use of cotton and increase production on the premise of ensuring quality, as a practical action to support the joint declaration and support the liberation of Taiwan.
    The members of the Wan Shaohe Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wanjia Village, Nanchang County, read the joint declaration and held a discussion on the 23rd at noon. Wan Tangpo, the deputy director of the cooperative, happily said: "That's great! The peasant brothers in Taiwan will also live a peaceful and happy life like us. Now, our cooperative has expanded the planting of more than 29 mu of double-cropping rice. We must guarantee to increase the yield per unit area and produce more grain to support the liberation of Taiwan."
    A certain company of the guard battalion of the Jiangxi Military Region Command held a forum for combat heroes and model learners of the whole company. Soldier Cai Rongsheng said: "Taiwan is our country's territory, and we must not tolerate the occupation by American imperialism and the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique." Deputy platoon leader and combat hero Gao Jingrong said: "I am a people's soldier and a defender of the motherland. Liberating Taiwan is our task. If the motherland needs us, we will pack our bags and set off immediately." All the officers and soldiers of the Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Corps stated that they would resolutely safeguard local public security, suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, vigilantly guard their posts, and strive to defend the great socialist construction cause of the motherland and support the liberation of Taiwan.
    The vast number of cadres, professors, doctors, nurses, veteran artists, actors, and scientific workers in Nanchang City unanimously supported the joint declaration and expressed their determination. Xu Fansun, the leader of the first batch of volunteer medical surgery team in Jiangxi to aid Korea, said: "We are fully confident of liberating Taiwan. If American imperialism insists on being an enemy of the 600 million Chinese people and interferes with and obstructs our people's liberation of Taiwan, it will suffer the same crushing defeat as it did in Korea. I am a medical worker, and when the motherland needs me, I am willing to serve the liberation of Taiwan."
    Family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, propagandists, representatives of ethnic minorities, and residents of Bamao Lane in the Second District of Nanchang City also held forums on the 23rd. Luo Defang, the leader of the military dependents' joint group in Dunzitang, First District, said: "This declaration represents the will of the people of the whole country. I will write to my son and tell him to learn modern military technology well and strive to make great contributions in the liberation of Taiwan."

    江西人民增产节约支援解放台湾
    【本报南昌二十四日电】江西省各阶层人民热烈拥护中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言，决心以实际行动支援解放台湾。
    江西、新甡两纺织厂全体职工从广播里听到为解放台湾联合宣言，都表示要节约用棉，在保证质量的前提下提高产量，作为拥护联合宣言、支援解放台湾的实际行动。
    南昌县万家村万绍鹤农业生产合作社的社员们二十三日中午阅读了联合宣言并进行了座谈。该社副社长万堂婆高兴地说：“这下可好了，台湾的农民兄弟也将要和我们一样过和平幸福的生活。现在，我们社里已扩种了二十九亩多双季稻，一定保证提高单位面积产量，多打粮食支援解放台湾。”
    江西军区司令部警卫营某连召开了全连战斗功臣、学习模范的座谈会，战士蔡荣生说：“台湾是我国的领土，决不能容忍美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团盘据。”副排长战斗功臣高景荣说：“我是人民的战士、祖国的保卫者，解放台湾是我们的任务。祖国需要我们，立刻就整装出发。”江西省公安总队全体指战员表示，要坚决保卫地方治安，镇压一切反革命活动，警惕地守住自己的岗位，为保卫祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业，支援解放台湾而奋斗。
