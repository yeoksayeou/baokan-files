Dear friends:

The Chinese youth warmly congratulate the opening of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council meeting in Beijing. Let me, on behalf of our country's 120 million youth, express my sincere respect to the youth peace envoys from various countries.

We are very happy to be able to welcome you in our own country. As you all know, our country was subjected to foreign imperialist aggression and enslavement for a long time. Only because our people carried out an indomitable struggle did they end the history of being oppressed and enslaved a few years ago. During the long years of struggle of the entire Chinese people, they received the sympathy and support of the people of the world. When the Chinese youth think of their motherland having gained true independence and freedom, they will never forget the noble and great friendship of hundreds of millions of international friends.

The Chinese people and youth cherish the national independence and freedom they have already gained and love their motherland. Now, besides vowing to liberate the sacred territory of Taiwan, the greatest wish of our people is to create a happier life with their peaceful labor. As you can see, our country, with the selfless help of the great Soviet Union and the strong support of various People's Democratic countries, has already started a huge project of building socialism. We deeply believe that the development of our country's peaceful construction is conducive to defending world peace, and it will surely continue to receive the sympathy and support of the people of the world. Peace is a necessary condition for building our country. Therefore, the Chinese people are particularly concerned about world peace, particularly cherish the friendship with the people of all countries, and sincerely wish to coexist peacefully with all countries. In order to safeguard world peace, we will spare no effort to contribute all our strength.

Now, we see the peace movement is surging, and the struggle for national independence is booming. The recent Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the Indochina issue. This is a victory for the forces of peace, a victory for the principle of consultation, and a victory for the will of the awakened people to strive for independence and freedom. This victory gave the U.S. warmongering group another heavy blow. It will greatly encourage the courage of the people all over the world to strive for peace, democracy, and national independence. In the great struggle for peace, we are excited to see that the youth of all countries have strengthened their unity and friendship and bravely stood at the forefront of the struggle. The Chinese youth are proud and honored to have their peace brothers all over the world.

At this meeting, we will focus on discussing the youth movement in colonial and dependent countries, which is indeed a very important and urgent issue. As everyone knows, since the Second World War, the vigorous national independence and liberation movement has fundamentally shaken the imperialist colonial system. However, the aggressive forces headed by the U.S. warmongering group are not willing to fail. They raise the banner of "anti-communism," establish military bases everywhere, coerce some countries to organize so-called "defense groups," and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. This sinful plan has brought endless disasters to the people of colonial and all oppressed countries, and seriously threatens international security and world peace. U.S. imperialism has become the most ferocious enemy of the people and youth all over the world. The youth of these countries understand that only by opposing U.S. imperialism, only by achieving peace and national independence, can the vital interests of the youth and their bright future be guaranteed. Now, we see that they are carrying out a heroic struggle. This is a sacred patriotic struggle and a struggle to safeguard world peace. The Chinese youth understand from their own experience that the road of struggle of the people of these countries, although arduous and tortuous, is the road to victory. The deep sympathy of the Chinese youth is on the side of the youth of the oppressed nations, on the side of those who are waging a tenacious struggle for the independence and freedom of their motherland.

The overall situation tells us that we will make greater achievements in the future struggle for peace. Everyone knows that the warmongering group is only a small handful of people, and a small handful of people cannot conquer the world. Therefore, they desperately deceive the youth, constantly rack their brains to undermine the unity among the youth, and spread hostile emotions among the youth in order to turn the youth into their tools of aggression. There are indeed different beliefs and different life interests among us youth, but they are all pure and enthusiastic. We all have noble ideals of creating happiness for mankind, and we all hope to have a bright future. There should not be any discrimination and hatred among the youth. Young people can completely be good friends and can completely live together in this world. The current meeting is a powerful proof. Representatives from dozens of countries present here have various skin colors, parties, religious beliefs, political views, and living habits, and represent countries with different systems. But we have found a common language, we stand shoulder to shoulder at the forefront of the struggle for peace, and we have established close friendship with each other. Friends! Strengthen unity, expand unity, and strive for more youth to join the ranks of peace. We can make greater contributions to the cause of peace and we will definitely be able to completely dismantle the war.

In the past few years, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has done a lot of work in this regard, and it is a glorious banner for the youth all over the world. We are confident that it will achieve greater success in attracting and inspiring millions of young men and women to fight for peace, democracy, national independence, and the bright future of the youth. The Chinese youth will always be loyal to the cause of unity of the youth all over the world and will always be the most loyal and reliable friends of the youth of all countries.

I wish the conference a complete success!

    中国青年和各国青年永远和平友好
    ——在世界民主青年联盟理事会北京会议开幕时的欢迎词
    中国青年代表团团长　胡耀邦亲爱的朋友们：
    中国青年热烈地祝贺世界民主青年联盟理事会北京会议的召开。让我代表我们国家的一万万二千万青年，向来自各国的青年和平使者表示由衷的敬意。
    我们能够在自己的国家里欢迎你们，感到十分高兴。各位知道，我们的国家曾经长期地受着外国帝国主义的侵略和奴役。只是由于我国人民进行了不屈不挠的斗争，几年前才结束了被压迫被奴役的历史。全中国人民长期奋斗的日子里，曾经得到全世界人民的同情和支持。当中国青年想到自己的祖国已经得到真正的独立和自由的时候，永远忘不了亿万国际友人这种崇高而伟大的友谊。
    中国人民和青年非常珍贵已经得到的民族独立和自由，热爱着自己的祖国。现在，我国人民除了立誓解放神圣的领土台湾而外，最大的愿望，就是用自己的和平劳动，创造更加幸福的生活。各位可以看到，我们的国家在伟大的苏联无私的帮助下，在各个人民民主国家的大力支援下，已经开始了建设社会主义的巨大工程。我们深深地相信，我国和平建设的发展，是有利于保卫世界和平的，它一定会继续得到全世界人民的同情和支持。和平，这是建设我们的国家的一个必要的条件。因此，我国人民特别关心世界和平，特别珍贵和各国人民的友谊，并真诚地愿意和一切国家和平共处。为了维护世界和平，我们将不惜贡献自己所有的力量。
    现在，我们看到和平运动日益高涨，争取民族独立的斗争正蓬勃开展。最近日内瓦会议就印度支那问题达成协议，这是和平力量的胜利，是协商原则的胜利，也是已经觉醒了的人民争取独立、自由的意志的胜利。这个胜利，给了美国好战集团又一次沉重的打击。它将大大地鼓舞全世界人民争取和平、民主、民族独立斗争的勇气。在为和平的伟大斗争中，我们兴奋地看到：各国青年都加强了自己的团结和友谊，英勇地站在斗争的前列。中国青年以自己的和平弟兄遍布全球而感到骄傲和自豪。
    在这次会议上，我们将着重地讨论殖民地附属国青年运动问题，这的确是非常重要和迫切的问题。大家知道，自从第二次世界大战之后，蓬蓬勃勃发展着的民族独立解放运动，已从根本上动摇了帝国主义的殖民制度。但是，以美国好战集团为首的侵略势力，是不甘心失败的，他们打起“反共”的幌子，到处建立军事基地，胁迫一些国家组织所谓“防御集团”，干涉他国内政。这种罪恶计划给殖民地和一切被压迫的国家的人民带来了无穷无尽的灾难，使国际安全和世界和平受到严重的威胁。美帝国主义已经成为全世界人民和青年的最凶恶的敌人。这些国家的青年都懂得，只有反对美帝国主义，只有取得了和平和民族独立，青年的切身权益和自己的美好前途，才有保证。现在，我们看到他们正在进行着英勇的斗争，这是神圣的爱国斗争，也是维护世界和平的斗争。中国青年从自己的切身经验中懂得：这些国家人民的斗争道路，尽管是艰苦曲折的，但这是通向胜利的道路。中国青年的深厚同情是在被压迫民族青年方面的，是在那些为了自己的祖国独立自由而进行着顽强斗争的战士方面的。
    整个的形势告诉我们在今后的和平斗争中将做出更大的成绩。谁都清楚好战集团只不过是一小撮人，一小撮人是不能征服世界的。因而他们就拼命欺骗青年，时刻处心积虑地破坏青年之间的团结，在青年当中散布敌视的情绪，以便把青年变成他们的侵略工具。我们青年之间固然有不同的信仰，不同的生活志趣，但都是纯洁的、热情的。我们都有为人类创造幸福的高尚理想，也都希望自己有一个美好的前程。青年之间不应该存在有任何的歧视和仇恨。青年人完全可以做好朋友，完全可以在这个世界上共同生活下去。眼前的会议就是一个有力的证明，在座几十个国家的代表，有着各种不同的肤色，党派，宗教信仰，政治见解和生活习惯，并代表不同制度的国家。但我们找到了共同的语言，我们肩并肩地站在和平斗争的前列，彼此间建立了亲密的友谊。朋友们！加强团结，扩大团结，争取更广泛的青年走进和平的行列，我们就可以对和平事业作出更大的贡献，就一定能够彻底把战争拆垮。
    几年以来，世界民主青年联盟在这方面做了很多工作，它是全世界青年一面光辉的旗帜。我们确信：它在吸引和鼓舞千百万的男女青年为和平、民主、民族独立、青年的美好将来而斗争的事业中，一定会获得更大的成就。中国青年永远忠实于全世界青年的团结事业，永远是各国青年最忠实可靠的朋友。
    谨祝大会圆满成功！
