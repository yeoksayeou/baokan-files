Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 18th: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 17th, the U.S. side's chief commissioner, Britton, again presented a fabricated list of U.S. prisoners of war in an attempt to evade responsibility for the U.S. side's forcible detention of a large number of captured Korean and Chinese personnel, and to cover up a series of U.S. violations of the armistice agreement.

Britton admitted that the prisoner of war list of 3,405 people previously submitted by the U.S. side was still full of loopholes despite repeated revisions. Britton admitted that some prisoners of war had already been repatriated and some had died. However, he then fabricated a "completely new" so-called prisoner of war list based on the U.S.'s crudely made old list, demanding that the Korean and Chinese sides provide an explanation. Britton also unreasonably stated that only after the Korean and Chinese sides had made an "explanation" of the U.S.'s fabricated prisoner of war list would the U.S. be prepared to submit explanatory materials regarding the 98,742 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war it had not yet accounted for.

General Li Xiangchao resolutely rejected the U.S.'s fabricated so-called prisoner of war list. General Li Xiangchao pointed out: "The fact is very clear, our side has been responsible for fulfilling all responsibilities related to prisoners of war that our side should fulfill in accordance with the agreement between the two sides. There are no captured personnel from your side for whom our side needs to provide any further explanation." General Li Xiangchao continued: "As for the materials that your side should submit to our side, that is a responsibility that your side should fulfill. There is no reason for your side to delay in submitting them, let alone put forward any conditions for fulfilling your due responsibilities."

As everyone knows, all sick and wounded prisoners of war and directly repatriated prisoners of war on the U.S. side have been fully repatriated. All U.S. prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated have been transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the U.S. prisoners of war who refused repatriation have been received by the Red Cross Societies of the Korean and Chinese sides, awaiting appropriate handling. However, the U.S. side has not yet provided a responsible account for the list of 98,742 prisoners of war submitted by the Korean and Chinese sides based on the lists submitted by the U.S. side in the past, the letters of the captured personnel, and the publicly published materials of the U.S. side.

Britton attempted to evade the responsibility for the U.S. side's forcible detention of prisoners of war by confusing right and wrong and diverting attention. He deliberately confused the talks between the Chinese delegation and the U.S. delegation at the Geneva Conference on the issue of the return of nationals of the two countries and the prisoner of war issue in the Korean War, and listed some U.S. military personnel who were not prisoners of war in the Korean War on the U.S.'s fabricated list, demanding that the Korean and Chinese sides provide an "explanation." General Li Xiangchao immediately replied to Britton, saying: Some of the military personnel from your side that you mentioned were detained by relevant authorities outside of Korea due to their actions, and the handling of them is not within the jurisdiction of the Military Armistice Commission. It is inappropriate to raise this irrelevant matter for discussion at the Military Armistice Commission.

General Li Xiangchao then questioned Britton: "In June 1953, your side perfidiously violated the agreement and forcibly detained more than 27,000 captured personnel from our side. Your commander-in-chief promised to make efforts to retrieve them. Have they all been retrieved now? When will they be returned to our side?" As soon as this substantive issue of the U.S. side's detention of prisoners of war was touched upon, Britton immediately evaded answering and hastily suggested an adjournment.

General Li Xiangchao pointed out that Britton had not given a responsible answer, and then questioned: "Regarding the more than 21,000 captured personnel from our side who were forcibly detained by your side in January 1954 in violation of the scope of authority, is your side prepared to give a responsible explanation?" Britton also avoided giving a direct answer to this question.

General Li Xiangchao pointed out that the U.S. side had consistently avoided giving a positive and responsible answer today (the 17th), and he stated at the meeting: The Korean and Chinese sides will definitely pursue to the end the crime of the U.S. side's forcible detention of a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in violation of the Geneva Convention, the Armistice Agreement, and the "scope of authority."

    美方又提出捏造的战俘名单企图逃避美方强扣战俘责任
    李相朝指出美方强扣战俘我方将追究到底
    【新华社开城十八日电】军事停战委员会美方首席委员布里敦十七日在军事停战委员会上又提出一份捏造的美方战俘名单，企图借此逃避美方强迫扣留大批朝中被俘人员的责任，并掩盖美方最近一系列的违反停战协定的行为。
    布里敦承认美方过去所提出的包括三千四百零五人的战俘名单虽然经过多次修改仍然是漏洞百出。布里敦承认其中有的战俘已经遣返，有的已经死亡。然而他却又根据美方粗制滥造的旧名单，捏造出一份“全新的”所谓战俘名单，要求朝中方面交代。布里敦并无理地表示，只有在朝中方面对美方的这份捏造的战俘名单作出“交代”的条件下，美方才准备就它至今没有向朝中方面交代的九万八千七百四十二名朝中战俘提出交代材料。
    李相朝将军断然拒绝了这份美方捏造的所谓战俘名单。李相朝将军指出：“事实很清楚，所有按照双方协议我方应该履行的有关战俘的责任，我方均已负责履行。没有任何你方被俘人员尚须我方另作交代。”李相朝将军接着指出：“至于你方应该向我方交代的材料，那是你方应该履行的责任，你方没有任何理由至今迟迟不交，更没有理由就履行你方应尽的责任提出任何条件。”
    大家知道，所有美方的病伤战俘和直接遣返的战俘，都已经全部遣返。不直接遣返的美方战俘已经全部移交中立国遣返委员会，其中拒绝遣返的美方战俘已经由朝中两国的红十字会接收，等待适当的处理。然而，对于朝中方面根据美方历次交来的名单、被俘人员的信件和美方公开发表的材料提出的九万八千七百四十二名战俘的名单，美方却至今还没有作出负责的交代。
    布里敦企图以混淆是非，转移视线的办法来逃避美方强迫扣留战俘的责任。他故意把出席日内瓦会议的中国代表团和美国代表团间举行的关于两国侨民返国问题的会谈和朝鲜战争中的战俘问题混为一谈，把一些并非朝鲜战争中战俘的美方军事人员列在美方捏造的名单中，要求朝中方面“交代”。李相朝将军当即回答布里敦说：你所说的某些你方军事人员，系由于他们的行动而在朝鲜境外被有关当局所拘留，对他们的处理不在军事停战委员会的职权范围之内。在军事停战委员会上提出这一不相干的事项来讨论是不恰当的。
    李相朝将军接着质问布里敦：“一九五三年六月你方背信弃义地违反协议所强迫扣留的二万七千余名我方被俘人员，你方总司令承诺将努力追回。现在是否已经全部追回？何时交还我方？”一接触到这个美方扣留战俘的实质问题，布里敦就立即支吾其词地逃避回答，匆忙地建议休会。
    李相朝将军指出布里敦没有作负责的答复，并接着质问：“对于一九五四年一月你方违反职权范围所强迫扣留的我方二万一千余名被俘人员，你方是否准备作负责的交代？”对于这个问题，布里敦也逃避作直接的回答。
    李相朝将军指出美方今天（十七日）始终回避作正面的负责答复，他并在会上声明：对于美方违反日内瓦公约、停战协定和“职权范围”强迫扣留大批朝中战俘的罪行，朝中方面必将追究到底。
