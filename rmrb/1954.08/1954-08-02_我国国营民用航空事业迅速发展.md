    China's State-Run Civil Aviation Undertaking Develops Rapidly
    Since the inauguration of state-run routes under the Civil Aviation Administration Bureau of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission on August 1, 1950, the state-run civil aviation undertaking has achieved rapid development over the past four years. The Beijing-Wuhan-Chongqing line, the Beijing-Xi'an-Chongqing line, the Chongqing-Wuhan-Shanghai line, the Chongqing-Kunming line, and the Kunming-Guangzhou line, which have been opened successively by the Civil Aviation Administration Bureau, have provided a certain transportation capacity for the country's urgent passenger and freight transport. Comparing June of this year with August of the fourth year since the opening of the routes, the route mileage has increased by 38.2 percent, the number of passengers has increased by 13.6 percent, the tonnage of cargo has increased by 445.9 percent, and the total turnover (ton-kilometers) has increased by 386.7 percent.
    Among the largest increase in cargo tonnage, the proportion of industrial equipment in all cargo has gradually increased from 13.7 percent in 1951 to 48.9 percent in the first half of this year. The volume of industrial equipment delivered has increased rapidly in recent years, increasing by more than 51 times in the first half of this year compared with 1951. The urgent equipment such as steel plates, bearings, and electric meters air transported from Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou to various places in Southwest China has strongly supported the industrial construction in Southwest China.
    In the past four years, in addition to operating passenger, freight, and mail transportation on its state-run routes, the Civil Aviation Administration Bureau has also made certain achievements in serving agricultural and forestry production. For example, it has dispatched aircraft for forest fire prevention patrols and alarms, locust control, and transportation of pesticides and livestock breeds. This autumn, the bureau also plans to cooperate with a state-owned farm to conduct a series of experiments on aerial fertilization, sowing, and pest control.
    In the past four years, the Civil Aviation Administration Bureau has also made great progress in technology. Now there are communication equipment and weather forecasting organizations along the line to ensure flight safety. The telecommunications department has successfully trial-produced high-frequency direction finders in accordance with Soviet specifications. Last year, a labor competition for 100,000 kilometers of safe flight was launched among flight personnel, and currently twelve flight groups have successfully completed the task of 100,000 kilometers of safe flight. Among them, the Liang Taishan group safely flew 150,000 kilometers in more than a year. The aircraft maintenance organization under the Civil Aviation Administration Bureau can now not only effectively undertake the maintenance tasks of various types of aircraft, but also undertake the task of major overhauls of aircraft fuselages.
    Since last year, the state-owned air transportation industry has carried out a series of reforms in production management and business operations. By learning from the advanced experience of Soviet civil aviation, various rules and regulations have been re-examined and established based on various Soviet civil aviation regulations. The mechanical department has reviewed and determined the man-hour quotas for various levels of maintenance of various types of aircraft, which has doubled work efficiency. On the basis of the successful trial production of high-frequency direction finders, the telecommunications department is trying to establish a ground-based direction finding network. (Peng Cheng)

    我国国营民用航空事业迅速发展
    中央人民政府革命军事委员会民用航空局所属国营航线自一九五○年八月一日开航，四年以来，国营民用航空事业获得了迅速的发展。民航局先后开辟的北京武汉重庆线、北京西安重庆线、重庆武汉上海线、重庆昆明和昆明广州线等，已经为国家的急要客货运输提供了一定的运输能力。如以今年六月份和四年前开航的八月相比较，航线里程增长了百分之三十八点二，旅客人数增长了百分之十三点六，货物吨数增长了百分之四百四十五点九，总周转量（吨公里）增长了百分之三百八十六点七。
    增长最多的货物吨数中，工业器材在全部货物中所占的比重已由一九五一年的百分之十三点七逐年增加到今年上半年的百分之四十八点九。几年来工业器材的交运量迅速增加，今年上半年较一九五一年增长了五十一倍多。由天津、上海、广州空运至西南各地的钢板、轴承、电表等各项急需器材，有力地支援了西南各地的工业建设。
    四年来，民航局除经营所属各国营航线的客货邮件运输外，在为农林业生产服务方面，也取得了一定的成绩。如派飞机为森林防火巡逻报警，灭蝗，运送农药、畜种等。今年秋天，该局还准备和某处国营农场合作，进行一系列的飞机施肥、播种、杀虫的试验。
    四年来，民航局在技术方面也有了很大的提高。现在沿线都有了为保证飞行安全的通讯设备和气象预报组织。电讯部门仿照苏联规格，试制成功了高频定向仪。去年在飞行人员中开展了十万公里安全飞行的劳动竞赛，目前已有十二个飞行组胜利完成了十万公里的安全飞行任务。其中梁泰山小组在一年多的时间中，安全飞行达十五万公里。民航 局所属的飞机维护机构，现在不仅能有效地担任各型飞机的维护任务，而且能够担任飞机机身大翻修的任务。
    去年以来，国营航空运输事业在生产管理和业务经营上进行了一系列的改革，通过学习苏联民航先进经验，根据苏联民航各种条令重新审定和建立了各项规章和制度。机务部门审定了各型飞机各级检修的工时定额，使工作效率提高了一倍。电讯部门在试制高频定向仪成功的基础上，正在试行建立地面定向网的制度。　（鹏程）
