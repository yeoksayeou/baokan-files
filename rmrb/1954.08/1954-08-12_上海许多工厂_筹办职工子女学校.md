    Many factories in Shanghai are actively preparing to establish schools for employees' children, in order to appropriately meet the enrollment and further education needs of the employees' children. At present, the Shanghai Motor Factory (state-owned), the Shanghai Turbine Factory (state-owned), the No. 1, No. 5, and No. 9 factories of the Shenxin Textile Company, and the Huacheng Cigarette Factory, among others, have the necessary conditions and have decided to open junior high schools. The Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 has decided to open primary schools. These factories have all established working groups to be responsible for carrying out the preparatory work. The issues of school funding, teachers, and school buildings have basically been resolved. The Shanghai Motor Factory (state-owned) and the Shanghai Turbine Factory (state-owned) are very close to each other and both factories have the need to establish schools, so it was decided to jointly open two first-year junior high school classes. The three factories of the Shenxin Textile Company will jointly open five first-year junior high school classes. Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 will first open one primary school class this year. In the process of preparing to establish schools for employees' children, the factories have received encouragement and assistance from the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Culture and Education Committee, the Education Bureau, and the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and other units.

    上海许多工厂
    筹办职工子女学校
    上海许多工厂积极筹办职工子女学校，以适当满足职工子女的入学和升学要求。目前，条件具备并已决定开办初级中学的有国营上海电机厂，国营上海汽轮机厂，申新纺织厂一厂、五厂、九厂，华成烟厂等；决定开办小学的有上海钢铁一厂。这些工厂都成立了工作组负责进行筹备工作。学校的经费、师资、校舍等问题基本上都已获得解决。国营上海电机厂和国营上海汽轮机厂距离很近，两厂都有办学需要，就决定联合开办初中一年级两个班级。申新纺织厂的三个厂共开办初中一年级五个班级。上海钢铁一厂今年先开办小学一个班级。各厂在筹办职工子女学校的过程中，得到上海市人民政府文化教育委员会、教育局和上海总工会等单位的鼓励和协助。　（新华社）
