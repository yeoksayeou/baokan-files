    Correcting Erroneous Behavior Violating the Grain Planned Supply Policy
    Editor's Note: The criticism of the Langxiang Forest Industry Bureau in Heilongjiang Province by reader Shi Quan regarding its stockpiling of grain is correct. It is necessary for forest areas, which are far from cities and have inconvenient transportation, to maintain a certain amount of grain reserves. However, the Langxiang Forest Industry Bureau has stored five to six times, even ten times, the amount of grain actually needed each month. This is no longer a reasonable reserve but a serious stockpiling. This erroneous behavior, which violates the grain planned supply policy, should be severely criticized. It is worth noting that similar situations are not isolated cases. According to readers' letters, some government agencies and enterprises, when reporting their grain demand plans, often only consider their own convenience and do not hesitate to falsely report the number of personnel to fraudulently claim or purchase food grain. Some units always want to "pad" their plans, exaggerating them as much as possible, exceeding actual needs. These practices not only undermine the planning of grain supply work, causing undue difficulties for grain supply departments and creating a negative impact among the masses, but also easily lead to undue losses of state grain. Therefore, all localities should attach importance to this phenomenon and seriously check and correct similar erroneous behavior.
    Reader Shi Quan writes: The Langxiang Forest Industry Bureau in Heilongjiang Province stockpiles large quantities of grain, undermining the state's grain planned supply policy. According to the state-stipulated supply standards, by the end of April, the bureau's inventory of coarse grains was sufficient to feed the current number of people for six months and five days, its inventory of flour was sufficient to feed the current number of people for thirteen months, its inventory of soybean oil was sufficient to feed the current number of people for six months and eighteen days, its inventory of sorghum (animal feed) was sufficient to feed the current number of horses for more than four years, and other grains were also stockpiled to varying degrees. According to the regulations of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government Forest Industry Administration Bureau, the maximum grain reserve for general forest industry departments should not exceed two months, but the grain stored by the Langxiang Forest Industry Bureau far exceeds this regulation.
    The grain stockpiled by the Langxiang Forest Industry Bureau mainly comes from two sources: First, when the grain planned supply system began in 1953, the bureau already had a large inventory of grain. For example, the flour inventory in December 1953, according to the state-stipulated supply standards, could feed the actual number of people at that time for three months and twenty-one days. However, the bureau not only failed to report this stock of grain at that time, but also continued to receive grain from the grain department each month, far exceeding actual needs. Second, Gao Yushan, deputy section chief of the bureau's materials section, added a large number of coarse grain plans without any basis when submitting the December grain demand plan at the forest area grain supply conference held by the Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Bureau in November 1953, which further aggravated the unreasonable stockpiling of grain.
    In January of this year, the Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Bureau's supply section stationed in the forest area repeatedly requested the bureau to provide inventory grain figures, but the bureau repeatedly refused to submit them, citing inaccurate inventory figures as an excuse. After the Northeast Administrative Committee Forest Industry Administration Bureau and the Grain Bureau issued a joint notice, the bureau did not report the inventory grain figures until April.
    The Langxiang Forest Industry Bureau's stockpiling of large quantities of grain not only violates the state's grain planned supply policy, creating a negative political impact, but also, because most of the stored grain is scattered in the mountains and remote areas, with poor storage conditions and inexperienced storage personnel, the moisture content exceeds the safety standard, and some of it has already become moldy or deteriorated.
    It is understood that such behavior of violating state policy and stockpiling grain also exists in other forest industry departments. Therefore, it is suggested that the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government Forest Industry Administration Bureau and other relevant departments should, on the one hand, strengthen education for relevant personnel and correct this illegal behavior to ensure the smooth implementation of the grain planned supply policy; on the other hand, they should take effective measures in a timely manner to strengthen the storage of grain stockpiled in the forest area to prevent these grains from suffering undue losses.

### 纠正违反粮食计划供应政策的错误行为

专栏：读者来信摘要

    纠正违反粮食计划供应政策的错误行为
    编者按：读者史泉对黑龙江省郎乡森林工业局积压粮食的批评是正确的。林区距离城市较远，交通不便，保持一定数量的粮食储备是必要的。但是，郎乡森林工业局竟存了每月实际需用量五、六倍到十几倍的粮食，这已经不是合理的储备，而是严重的积压了；这种违反粮食计划供应政策的错误行为，应该受到严厉的批评。值得注意的是：类似这样的情况还不是个别的。根据读者来信反映：某些机关和企业部门在造报需粮计划时，往往只顾本单位的方便，不惜用虚报人数的办法来冒领或冒购食粮。某些单位总想“宽打窄用”，尽量把计划造大，超过了实际需要量。这些作法，不仅破坏了粮食供应工作的计划性，使粮食供应部门的工作增加不应有的困难，在群众中造成了恶劣的影响，而且很容易使国家的粮食遭受不应有的损失。因此，各地应该对这种现象引起重视，认真检查和纠正类似的错误行为。
    读者史泉来信：黑龙江省郎乡森林工业局积压大批粮食，破坏了国家的粮食计划供应政策。按国家规定的供应标准计算，到四月底为止，该局库存粗粮可供现有人数食用六个月零五天，库存面粉可供现有人数食用十三个月，库存豆油可供现有人数食用六个月零十八天，库存高粱（牲口饲料）可供现有马匹饲用四年多，其他粮食也有程度不同的积压。根据黑龙江省人民政府森林工业管理局规定，一般森林工业部门的粮食储备最多不得超过两个月，而郎乡森林工业局储存的粮食则远远超过了这个规定。
    郎乡森林工业局积压的粮食主要是从两方面来的：一、当一九五三年开始实行粮食计划供应时，该局库存粮食已经很多，如一九五三年十二月份库存的面粉，按照国家规定的供应标准可以供当时实有人数食用三个月零二十一天。可是该局当时不但没有把这批存粮上报，并且仍然逐月向粮食部门领取远远超过实际所需的粮食。二、该局材料科副科长高玉山在一九五三年十一月份到黑龙江省粮食厅开林区粮食供应会议时，曾在提出十二月份需粮计划的同时，毫无根据地增加了大批粗粮计划，这就使不合理的粮食积压现象更加严重了。
    今年一月份，黑龙江省粮食厅驻林区供应科曾几次向该局要库存粮食数字，但该局一再以库存数不准为借口，拒不提报。东北行政委员会森林工业管理局、粮食局发出了联合通知后，该局直到四月份才将库存粮数上报。
    郎乡森林工业局积压大批粮食，不仅违背了国家的粮食计划供应政策，造成了恶劣的政治影响；而且由于大部分存粮分散在山上和偏僻地区，保管条件不好，保管人员又缺乏经验，所含水分都超过了安全标准，并且有一部分已经霉坏或变质。
    据了解，这种违反国家政策、积压粮食的行为，在其他森林工业部门也有。因此，建议黑龙江省人民政府森林工业管理局等有关部门，一方面要对有关人员加强教育，纠正这种不法行为，以保证粮食计划供应政策顺利地贯彻；另一方面要及时采取有效措施来加强森林区所积压的粮食的保管工作，免得使这些粮食受到不应有的损失。
