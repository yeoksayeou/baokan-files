Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 25th: According to a report from Deutsche Presse-Agentur, Dusseldorf: The Central Committee of the German Communist Party held its fifteenth plenary session from August 19th to 20th. Max Reimann, Chairman of the German Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting on "The National Significance of the West German People's Movement and the Tasks of the German Communist Party." The meeting discussed Reimann's report in detail.

The meeting also put forward the following main tasks for preparing for the convening of the German Communist Party Congress: (1) Strengthen the united action of the working class. The struggle of West German workers to increase wages and oppose the Adenauer's "European Defense Community" treaty policy has significant national significance. The Central Committee instructed all Communist Party members to pay extreme attention to the continued and victorious progress of the strike movement in Bavaria, and to strengthen the struggle of public utility workers, metalworkers, and miners in the Ruhr area, as well as workers in other industrial sectors, to increase wages. The Central Committee called on all workers, farmers, handicraftsmen, small business owners, and intellectuals to support the striking workers. (2) Fully support the popular referendum against the "European Defense Community" treaty and the "General Treaty," in favor of concluding a peace treaty and withdrawing the occupying forces, and expand the people's movement supporting the suggestions of the People's Chamber (of the German Democratic Republic). Combine the workers' wage struggle, the resistance against building explosive tunnels, the opposition to the seizure of farmland, the opposition to the occupying forces' exercises, and the struggle against stockpiling atomic cannons with the movement for a popular referendum. Explain the content of the Soviet notes and the People's Chamber's appeals to the people in order to launch a broad movement demanding the acceptance of these suggestions, and demanding that the German question be discussed at another European nations conference with German participation. These demands should be sent to the members of the Bonn Parliament by factories, trade unions, organizations, and mass meetings in the form of letters and resolutions. (3) Consolidate the Party ideologically, politically, and organizationally. In the preparation for the Party Congress, the Party's ideological work must be strengthened.
