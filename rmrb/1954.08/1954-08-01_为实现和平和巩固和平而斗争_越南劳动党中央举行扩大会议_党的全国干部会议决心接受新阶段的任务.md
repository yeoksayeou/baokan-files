Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 31st: According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, August 30th, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party held its sixth enlarged meeting in mid-July.

    The meeting heard a report by President Ho Chi Minh on the new situation and new tasks, as well as supplementary reports by Comrade Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and Comrade Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army.

    The Vietnam Workers' Party's official newspaper, "Nhan Dan," commented on the important significance of this meeting in a recent issue. "Nhan Dan" said: After analyzing the domestic and international situation, the Central Committee of the Party, in order to strive for and consolidate peace, and to realize national unification, independence, and democracy, decided to revise its strategic policy to suit the new situation. The Central Committee decided to continue to struggle for the realization of peace in Vietnam, as well as in Laos and Cambodia. Once peace is restored, it is necessary to consolidate peace and continue to complete the tasks that have not yet been achieved.

    "Nhan Dan" also said: Although many difficulties have been overcome and great victories have been achieved through the method of consultation to restore peace in Indochina, our people will still encounter some difficulties on the road ahead. Therefore, the entire Party, army, and people must be closely united in thought and action, and resolutely struggle to implement the new guidelines and policies formulated by our Party, in order to achieve greater victories. On the other hand, we should always maintain a high degree of vigilance.

    "Nhan Dan" pointed out that we have just achieved a major diplomatic victory at the Geneva Conference, but this is only the first step. All the people of our country must strengthen activities under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Party, exert greater strength, smash all the conspiracies of the warmongers, ensure the implementation of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities, and strive to resolve the political issues between Vietnam and France in order to realize the unification of the motherland and achieve the independence and democracy of the motherland.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 31st: According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, August 31st, the Vietnam Workers' Party held a national cadre conference from July 21st to 25th to discuss the new situation and new tasks, and to study the resolutions adopted by the sixth enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party in mid-July. At the meeting, President Ho Chi Minh analyzed the main characteristics of the current domestic and international situation, and put forward a new slogan for the entire Party and the people, namely, to struggle for peace, unification, independence, and democracy. President Ho Chi Minh also put forward three tasks and ten specific tasks for the Vietnam Workers' Party and the people. Comrade Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party, clearly explained the standards and content of each task.

    After five days of discussion, the delegates attending the meeting unanimously recognized the arduous and glorious tasks of the entire Party and all the people in this new stage of struggle after the great victory of signing the armistice agreement at the Geneva Conference.

    The Vietnam Workers' Party's official newspaper "Nhan Dan" commented on this meeting in a recent issue, saying: The sixth enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Party's national cadre conference have enabled the Party and the Vietnamese people to embark on a new stage of struggle. President Ho Chi Minh and the Central Committee of the Party have formulated new guidelines and policies. All cadres and members of the Party must further strengthen unity and strive to carry out new tasks and new work, especially to correctly implement the ceasefire orders and the regrouping area adjustment plan, and demand that the French government also strictly implement the terms of the armistice agreement. On the other hand, we must strengthen our forces and carry out land reform, etc., so that we can grasp the initiative and achieve complete victory in any environment.

      "Nhan Dan" continued: Whether in wartime or peacetime, in times of danger or victory, we must always improve our fighting spirit and not forget the qualities that President Ho Chi Minh taught us we should have, namely diligence, thrift, integrity, and incorruptibility.

    "Nhan Dan" concluded: This is the best way to win peace, consolidate peace, and realize unification, independence, and democracy in the whole country.

    为实现和平和巩固和平而斗争
    越南劳动党中央举行扩大会议
    党的全国干部会议决心接受新阶段的任务
   【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社北越三十日讯：越南劳动党中央委员会在七月中旬举行了第六次扩大会议。
    会议听取了胡志明主席关于新形势和新任务的报告，以及越南劳动党总书记长征同志和越南人民军总司令武元甲同志的补充报告。
    越南劳动党机关报“人民报”在最近一期中评论了这次会议的重要意义。“人民报”说：党的中央委员会在分析了国内和国际形势以后，为了争取和巩固和平，实现全国的统一、独立和民主，决定修改它的战略方针来适合新的形势。中央委员会决定继续为在越南以及老挝和柬埔寨实现和平而进行斗争。一旦恢复了和平，就必须巩固和平和继续完成还没有达成的任务。
    “人民报”又说：虽然通过协商恢复印度支那和平的方法已克服许多困难，并且取得了巨大胜利；但是，我们人民今后在前进的道路上仍会遇到一些困难。因此，全党、军队和人民必须在思想上和行动上紧密地团结一致，坚决地为实现我们党所制定的新方针和政策而斗争，以便取得更大的胜利。另一方面，我们应该始终保持高度的警惕。
   “人民报”指出，我们刚在日内瓦会议上取得了一个重大的外交胜利，但是这仅仅是第一步。我国全体人民必须在胡志明主席和党的领导下加强活动，发挥更大的力量，粉碎战争贩子们的一切阴谋，保证停止敌对行动协定的实施，争取解决越南与法国间的政治问题以便实现祖国的统一并取得祖国的独立和民主。
   【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社北越三十一日讯：七月二十一日到二十五日，越南劳动党举行了全国干部会议，讨论新的形势和新的任务，并研究了七月中旬越南劳动党中央委员会第六次扩大会议所通过的决议。胡志明主席在会议上分析了目前国内和国际形势的主要特点，为全党和人民提出了新的口号，即为和平、统一、独立和民主而斗争。胡志明主席并为越南劳动党和人民提出了三项任务和十项具体工作。越南劳动党总书记长征同志清楚地解释了每一项工作的标准和内容。
    经过五天的讨论以后，参加会议的代表们都一致认识到：在日内瓦会议上获得签订停战协定这一伟大胜利以后，全党和全体人民在这个新的斗争阶段里的艰巨而光荣的任务。
    越南劳动党的机关报“人民报”在最近一期中评论这次会议时说：越南劳动党中央委员会第六次扩大会议以及党的全国干部会议，已经使党和越南人民开始走上一个新的斗争阶段。胡志明主席和党的中央委员会已经拟订了新的方针和政策。党的全体干部和党员必须进一步加强团结，努力执行新的任务和新的工作，尤其是要正确地执行停火命令和集结地区调整计划，并要求法国政府也严格地执行停战协定的条款。另一方面，我们必须加强我们的力量，进行土地改革等等，这样，我们无论在什么环境之下都可以掌握着主动权和获得完全的胜利。
      “人民报”接着说：无论在战争时期或和平时期，在危险的时候或胜利的时候，我们都必须经常提高我们的战斗精神，不要忘记胡志明主席所教导我们应该具有的品质，即勤勉、节俭、正直和廉洁。
    “人民报”最后说：这是赢得和平与巩固和平以及在全国实现统一、独立和民主的最好的方法。
