    The Central Ministry of Internal Affairs, in Coordination with the Ministry of Railways and the China Native Produce Company, Transfers More Than 200,000 Straw Mats to Support Flood Prevention Efforts of the People of Wuhan.
    Jilin Province Cooperatives are Transporting 330,000 Straw Bags to Wuhan and Other Places.
      [This newspaper dispatch] The Central People's Government Ministry of Internal Affairs, in coordination with the Ministry of Railways, the China Native Produce Company and other departments, transported more than 200,000 straw mats in a little over a day to support the flood prevention and rescue efforts of the people of Wuhan.
    On the afternoon of August 3rd, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government telegraphed the Central People's Government Ministry of Internal Affairs requesting it to purchase some straw mats on their behalf for flood prevention and rescue. After receiving the call, the Ministry of Internal Affairs immediately contacted the Ministry of Railways, the Native Produce Company, and other departments. In order to do its utmost to support flood prevention, the Native Produce Company reduced its general supply volume and allocated all 210,000 straw mats it could spare to support flood prevention and rescue efforts in Wuhan. The Beijing Transportation Company dispatched more than 100 trucks and mobilized more than 300 transport workers to move all 210,000-plus straw mats to the railway station from 11:30 PM on the 4th to 1:00 PM on the 5th. Under the principle of "disaster relief first," the Ministry of Railways also gave strong support to this unplanned transport task, allocating a total of 80 rail cars to ensure immediate transport upon arrival. Thanks to the coordinated efforts of the above departments and their full support for the flood prevention and rescue efforts of the people of Wuhan, all 210,000-plus straw mats had been transported out by 6:00 PM on the 5th.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 4th] The Jilin Provincial Cooperative is currently loading and transporting 330,000 straw bags in batches to Wuhan, Bengbu, and other places to support flood prevention efforts in these areas. As of August 2nd, more than 160,000 bags have already been shipped. Weaving straw bags is one of the main sideline occupations of farmers in many counties (including the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture) in Jilin Province; straw bags are very important flood prevention materials. This year, cooperatives in various counties have vigorously expanded their procurement efforts, and have purchased more than five million bags to date.
