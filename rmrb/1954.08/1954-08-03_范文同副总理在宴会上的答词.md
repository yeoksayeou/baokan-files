Vice Premier, Friends, Comrades:

    Today, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is receiving a warm reception in Beijing. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party on behalf of the Vietnamese people.

    The Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party have always sympathized with and supported the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence. Today, the Vietnamese people are able to achieve victory in the eight-year war of resistance, and peace is able to triumph over war, which is inseparable from the sympathy and support of the Chinese people. Here, let me once again express my gratitude to the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party.

    Premier Zhou Enlai's speech was correct. The people of China and Vietnam are historically, geographically, and culturally closely related. The Chinese people have always sympathized with and cared for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. Premier Zhou's words will have a tremendous impact throughout Vietnam, thereby encouraging the Vietnamese people to continue to struggle for the cause of peace, for healing the wounds of war and restoring the national economy, and for continuing to consolidate and develop victory!

    The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is full of deep love and great strength.

    We believe that the friendship between the people of Vietnam and China will be as high as the mountains and as deep as the sea!

    Dear friends, comrades, let us raise our glasses to the great sun of the East—Chairman Mao Zedong, to the good health of Vice Chairmen Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai and other responsible comrades!

    范文同副总理在宴会上的答词总理，诸位朋友，诸位同志：
    今天越南民主共和国代表团在北京受到盛情招待，我特借此机会代表越南人民向中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党表示衷心谢意。
    中国人民和中国共产党一直就同情和支持越南人民的民族独立斗争。今天，越南人民能够取得八年抗战的胜利，和平能够战胜战争，是与中国人民的同情和支持分不开的。在此，让我向中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党再次表示感谢。
    周恩来总理的讲话说得对，中越两国人民在历史上、地理上和文化上休戚相关，中国人民对于越南人民的正义斗争，历来是同情和关怀的。周总理的话将在越南全国各地发生巨大的影响，从而鼓舞越南人民继续为和平事业，为医治战争创伤和恢复国民经济，为继续巩固胜利和发展胜利而斗争！
    以苏联为首的和平民主大家庭充满了深切的友爱和巨大的力量。
    我们相信，越中两国人民的友谊，将像山一样高，海一样深！
    亲爱的朋友们、同志们，让我们举杯敬祝东方的伟大的太阳——毛泽东主席，敬祝朱德、刘少奇副主席、周恩来总理和其他负责同志的身体健康！
