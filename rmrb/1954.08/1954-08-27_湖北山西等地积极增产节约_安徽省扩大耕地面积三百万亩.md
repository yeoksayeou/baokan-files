　　Hubei, Shanxi and Other Places Actively Increase Production and Practice Economy
　　Anhui Province Expands Cultivated Land by Three Million Mu

　　After some areas of Hubei Province suffered from floods, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, while engaged in tense flood prevention and disaster relief, successively issued instructions to exceed the target of increasing grain production by 2 billion catties in agriculture and to exceed the target of increasing production by 10% in local industry and transportation enterprises. Most areas have implemented the Provincial Party Committee's instructions and have achieved significant results. In order to comprehensively and deeply implement the increase in production and the practice of economy, the Provincial Party Committee convened the heads of the Party groups of provincial-level organs (various departments and bureaus) on August 18 for detailed research. Specific targets for increasing production and practicing economy were proposed: In terms of agricultural production increase, in addition to completing the increase of 2 billion catties of grain, it is also required that the people of the province work together to increase the production of nearly 10 billion catties of vegetables without affecting the increase in grain, cotton, and oil crops; local industry and transportation enterprises should increase production and practice economy by another 10% on top of this year's production plan, with a total increased value of 250 billion yuan; commercial departments are required to reduce operating and management expenses by more than 10% and accelerate commodity circulation. In terms of economy, the first is to save 12% from this year's fiscal budget for special districts and counties, and 16% for provincial-level directly affiliated organs; basic construction projects that can be postponed should be postponed. In addition, the people of the province and government cadres are mobilized to save two liang of rice per person per day.

　　Currently, all departments are formulating specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and are conducting in-depth ideological mobilization among cadres and the masses. The Industry Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial Industrial Department of the Provincial Government have held several meetings of factory and mine cadres to deploy the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy. Nearly 100 cadres have been dispatched to factories and mines to vigorously promote the development of this movement.

　　In order to support fellow countrymen affected by the disaster in the lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, farmers in Shanxi Province, according to the instructions of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the resolutions of the Provincial People's Congress, are striving to exceed the target of increasing grain production by 200 to 300 million catties on the basis of completing the 1954 production increase plan. At present, a widespread and in-depth agricultural surplus production movement has been launched throughout the province. Most of the Party and government leading organs at all levels convened emergency meetings in early August to discuss and deploy the targets and methods for surplus production. Some places have also sent cadres to provide specific guidance. Changzhi Special District alone, only five counties, including Lingchuan, Changzi, Tunliu, Huguan, and Qinyuan, and three districts of Pingshun and Wuxiang, had expanded the planting of late autumn crops by more than 1,000 mu, used small plots of land and field gaps to plant more than 16,000 mu of vegetables, and reclaimed more than 8,400 mu of wasteland by August 15. Under the leadership of 186 agricultural production cooperatives in Lingchuan County, 200 mutual aid teams have also launched a production increase movement. Two processing items, adding hoeing and increasing fertilizer application, have reached more than 106,700 mu. Farmers in Huguan County carried out artificial pollination and emasculation hybridization of corn on 14,860 mu and removed sorghum white hair disease from more than 40,000 mu. Farmers in mountainous areas are also actively fighting mountain disasters and striving for increased production.

　　The movement to expand cultivated land area in Anhui Province has been fully launched. According to statistics from only four special districts, namely Lu'an, Anqing, Wuhu, and Chuxian, as of August 14, nearly 3 million mu of cultivated land have been reclaimed. More than 1.27 million mu have been planted with late autumn crops such as sweet potatoes, corn, and beans.

　　In the movement to expand cultivated land, many areas have paid attention to seizing the season and achieving simultaneous reclamation and planting. As of August 14, Lu'an Special District had reclaimed more than 920,000 mu of land and planted more than 640,000 mu. Before August 5, the planting work in Anqing Special District did not progress quickly. After the Anqing Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party repeatedly instructed the importance of timely planting, this situation has been reversed. Now some areas are taking measures such as digging soil, breaking soil, sowing seeds, and digging holes for spot planting to improve sowing efficiency. Chuxian Special District also attaches great importance to simultaneous reclamation and planting. On August 12, more than 220,000 mu had been planted out of the newly reclaimed 360,000 mu. Cadres and farmers in Xizhang Township, Chihe District, Dingyuan County, fearing that the soil would be dry and cause planting difficulties, adopted the method of "plowing at night and planting while it's moist" and "plowing a piece, harrowing a piece, and planting a piece," and opened up all 1,600 mu of vacant land in the township and planted them in a timely manner.

　　A portion of the cultivated land reclaimed in various places is land that farmers were forced to abandon before liberation and has not been fully restored after liberation. It has water and grass and is extremely fertile. For example, in the Niutoushan, Qingliushan, and Dahongshan areas east of the Jinpu Railway in Chuxian County, there are no fewer than 10,000 mu of such abandoned land. Other general mountain land is also very fertile. The late corn planted on newly opened mountain land in Zhangshu Township, Zhide, is already a foot tall in some cases.

    湖北山西等地积极增产节约
    安徽省扩大耕地面积三百万亩
    湖北省部分地区遭受水灾后，中共湖北省委在紧张的防汛、救灾的同时，先后发出了农业上超额增产二十亿斤粮食、地方工业、交通运输企业超额增产百分之十的指示。大部分地区都贯彻了省委的指示，已收到显著成绩。为了全面深入地实行增产节约，省委在八月十八日召集省属机关（各厅、局）党组负责人详细进行研究。提出了具体的增产节约指标：在农业增产上，除了完成增产粮食二十亿斤外，还要求全省人民一齐动手在不影响粮、棉、油料增产的原则下，增产近百亿斤蔬菜；地方工业和交通运输企业在今年生产计划上再增产节约百分之十，其增产总值为二千五百亿元；要求商业部门降低经营管理费百分之十以上，并加速商品流转。在节约方面，首先是从今年财政预算上专、县节约百分之十二，省直属机关节约百分之十六；可以缓办的基本建设工程一律缓办。并动员全省人民和机关干部每人每天节约二两米。
    目前，各部门正拟定具体的增产节约计划，在干部和群众中进行深入的思想动员。中共湖北省委工业部和省府工业厅已召开数次厂、矿干部会议，把增产节约任务布置下去。并派近百名干部深入厂矿，努力推动这一运动的展开。

    为了支援长江淮河下游受灾同胞，山西省农民根据中共山西省委指示和省人民代表大会决议，争取在完成一九五四年增产计划的基础上，超额增产粮食二亿至三亿斤。目前全省已掀起了普遍深入的农业超额增产运动，各级党政领导机关大部均于八月上旬先后召开了紧急会议，讨论布置了超额增产指标与增产办法。有的地方并派出干部，具体指导。长治专区仅陵川、长子、屯留、壶关、沁源等五县及平顺、武乡的三个区，到八月十五日前即已扩大种植晚秋作物一千多亩，利用小块土地、田间空隙种植菜蔬一万六千多亩，开荒八千四百多亩。陵川县在一百八十六个农业生产合作社的带动下，二百个互助组亦开展了增产运动，仅加锄和增施肥料的两项加工即达十万六千七百多亩。壶关县农民进行玉米人工授粉去雄杂交一万四千八百六十亩，拔除谷子白发病四万多亩。靠山地区的农民也积极进行打山害，争取超额增产。

    安徽省扩大耕地面积运动，已全面展开，仅据六安、安庆、芜湖、滁县四个专区截至八月十四日的统计，垦出耕地已近三百万亩。并有一百二十七万多亩已种上红芋、玉米、豆类等晚秋庄稼。
    在扩大耕地运动中，不少地区都注意抓紧节令，做到边垦边种，六安专区截至八月十四日，垦地九十二万多亩，已下种六十四万多亩。安庆专区在八月五日以前播种工作进展不快，经中共安庆地委一再指示及时播种的重要性，已扭转这种情况。现在有些地区正采取边挖土、边碎土、边播种及挖穴点种等办法，提高播种效率。滁县专区对边垦边种也比较重视，八月十二日在新垦的三十六万多亩地中，已播种二十二万多亩。定远县池河区西张乡干部和农民怕土壤干燥，造成播种困难，采取了
  “连夜耕，趁潮种”、“耕一块、耙一块、种一块”的办法，把全乡一千六百多亩空白地全部开出，及时种上。
    各地垦出的耕地，有部分是解放前农民被迫抛荒、解放后尚未完全恢复的耕地，有水有草，极为肥沃，像滁县津浦路东牛头山、青流山、大洪山一带，这样的荒田就不下万亩。其他一般山地也很肥。至德樟树乡新开山地播种的晚玉米，高的已有尺把高。
