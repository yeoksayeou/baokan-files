The power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels. Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

Editor's Note: The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates that all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels. This provision fully demonstrates the democratic nature of our country and further consolidates the position of our people as masters of the country. In recent years, our people have gradually exercised the power to manage state and local affairs through people's representative conferences and people's congresses at all levels, supervised the work of the government and its staff, continuously improved various tasks, and also raised the people's awareness as masters of the country. The following articles use specific facts to illustrate the people's management of state affairs and the exercise of their power.

The founding of the People's Republic of China brought about a fundamental change in the political life of the Chinese people. In recent years, the broad masses of the people have participated in the management of state affairs through people's representative conferences and people's congresses at all levels.

Before the nationwide grassroots elections, the people participated in the management of state affairs through people's representative conferences at all levels. The people's representative conferences at all levels are composed of representatives elected by the people, democratic parties, organizations, institutions, and military units, and representatives invited by the people's governments at all levels. In recent years, the number of representatives directly and indirectly elected by the people in the people's representative conferences at all levels has gradually increased, generally reaching more than 80% of the total number of representatives, and in some cases more than 90%; the number of specially invited representatives has gradually decreased. Before the grassroots elections, there were a total of more than 13.6 million representatives to people's representative conferences at all levels across the country; the people's representative conferences in more than two-thirds of the provinces, more than two-thirds of the cities, more than one-third of the counties, and more than four-fifths of the townships have gradually exercised the functions and powers of the people's congresses.

The people, through the people's representative conferences, removed the shackles imposed on them by the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang. In recent years, various political movements and a series of democratic reforms launched throughout the country have mostly been organized and initiated through the people's representative conferences. The people's representative conferences in various places have also discussed the production and construction work of each period, made various resolutions, and organized the broad masses of the people to engage in the restoration and construction of the national economy. Through the people's representative conferences, the people supervised the work of the government and its cadres, reviewed the policies and work of the people's governments in each period, and criticized and even dealt with cadres who were unsatisfactory to the people. The implementation of the people's representative conferences in recent years has greatly raised the people's political consciousness, and many arduous tasks have been successfully completed with the full support of the people.

After this grassroots election, the people's congresses will soon universally replace the people's representative conferences throughout the country. During the grassroots election campaign, the broad masses of voters actively participated in the election, demonstrating the people's political enthusiasm and initiative in managing state affairs. After population census and registration, the total population of the country was 601,912,371, the total number of registered voters was 323,809,684, and 278,093,100 people participated in the voting, accounting for more than 85% of the total number of registered voters, with many areas reaching more than 90%, and some areas even reaching 100%. A total of 5,669,144 representatives to the grassroots people's congresses were elected nationwide, of which women representatives accounted for more than 17%. The elected representatives are all outstanding figures from all walks of life. Among the 1,200 representatives elected in the seven districts of Beijing, workers accounted for 32.8%, cadres accounted for 15.7%, cultural and educational circles and medical workers accounted for 15.2%, engineering and technical personnel accounted for 1.4%, cooperative workers accounted for 3%, private industrialists and businessmen accounted for 9.8%, religious professionals accounted for 1.6%, and street residents accounted for 20.5%. This fully reflects the unity and cooperation of the people of all classes and strata and the leading position of the working class.

Before the convening of the people's congresses in various places, the people's representatives visited and held discussions with the voters, earnestly listened to the opinions and demands of the masses, and widely collected proposals. Therefore, the people's congresses in various places have received many proposals. The four districts of Tianjin received 10,935 proposals. A large proportion of the proposals concerned the requirements and suggestions for implementing the general task of the state during the transition period and the opinions criticizing cadres, which fully reflected the ardent expectations of the broad masses of the people for realizing the state's general task and improving the work of state organs. All proposals have been carefully reviewed and handled in various places.

The people's representatives in various places, entrusted by the people, deeply felt the importance of their responsibilities and conscientiously discussed and reviewed the work of the government. For example, after listening to the government work report at the Jiangning County People's Congress in Jiangsu Province, the representatives put forward more than 130 opinions and criticisms. For example, they criticized the government for neglecting unified sales in the unified purchase and sale of grain; letting things take their own course in the mutual aid and cooperation movement; individual primary school teachers only take salaries and do nothing, teaching only seven lessons in a semester; some bank staff who go to the countryside to make loans do not understand the situation, and even lend to gamblers to gamble, and so on. The head of Jiangning County accepted the criticisms made by the people's representatives and made a sincere self-criticism, expressing that he would take concrete measures to gradually improve his work and overcome shortcomings. After listening to the county head's self-criticism, people's representative Wei Xiuzhen said: "After listening to the county head's self-criticism, I also feel ashamed. We, the people's representatives, have not seriously led the masses to do some of the work." In some places, when reviewing the government's work, they discussed the problems existing in the government's work and put forward solutions. For example, when the Hualian County People's Congress in Jilin Province discussed the problem that some farmers lacked seeds, it was decided to exchange them with each other by mutual aid groups, cooperatives, and villages; if they still could not be solved, they could be exchanged through the county agricultural section and grain storage and transportation company. Poor households can be given necessary assistance by the credit department.

The people's congresses in various places have made resolutions based on the requirements of the central work, the people's proposals, and the criticisms and suggestions of the people's representatives. For example, in the five industrial and mining districts of Fushun City, an average of more than 90% of the residents are workers and their families. In the past, the district people's government was not clear enough about the policy of serving production. At the people's congress held in the previous period, each district, based on the opinions of the people's representatives, decided that in the future, the mining area people's government should take effective measures to implement the policy of serving industrial production. Afterwards, each district organized cadres to go deep into the streets and workers' residential areas to inspect and rectify the mutual aid groups of workers' families, and organized new mutual aid groups of workers' families to ensure and promote production. The Lailong Township People's Congress in Luxian County, Sichuan Province, resolved to build five new ponds, repair seven ponds, and repair 24 embankment slopes, and resolved that the whole township should accumulate an average of 3,000 catties of fertilizer per person and develop 1,000 shares of cooperative funds. Afterwards, the number of newly built and repaired ponds and embankment slopes in the township exceeded the original resolution, and the cooperative funds increased by 1,230 shares. Once the resolutions of the people's congresses in various places are implemented, they quickly turn into mass actions.

The people show infinite concern for state affairs, manage and supervise all the work of state organs through various means. Every day, many people write letters or visit state organs, criticizing the shortcomings and errors in the work of state organs and providing suggestions for improving the work. According to statistics from 34 units in Tianjin in 1953, more than 90,000 letters from the people were received and people were received throughout the year. The people's letters and visits helped state organs improve their work, overcome shortcomings, combat bureaucracy, and educate cadres. Because state organs attached importance to the handling of the people's letters and visits, the number of letters and visits from the people in various places has gradually increased, and most of the letters are signed by the masses and delivered directly, and few are forwarded by higher authorities or delivered anonymously. This shows that the people's trust in state organs is also increasing.

Many regions have elected people's assessors to participate in the trial work of the people's courts. The assessor system is a fine tradition of the people's judicial work. The draft constitution consolidates and affirms it, which will further improve the people's democratic rule of law. In recent years, the trial work has been based on the convenience of the people and reliance on the people in terms of organizational form and working methods, thus creating and establishing mass line working methods and systems such as the people's assessor system, collective mediation, on-site trial, inquiry offices, and people's reception rooms, and absorbing the masses to participate in the work at any time according to the needs of mass movements. For example, the people's courts were established during the land reform and peasants were absorbed to participate. People's courts were established during the "Five-Anti" movement and workers and representatives of the Federation of Industry and Commerce were absorbed to participate, training a large number of workers and peasants to become excellent judges. In Shanghai alone, the "Five-Anti" people's courts absorbed 600 workers, shop assistants, and housewives to participate in the work. The broad masses of the people happily said: "Since the beginning of the world, there has never been a government like today's, handing over cases to the people!"

    人民群众广泛参加了国家事务的管理
    李仲海
    中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。中华人民共和国宪法草案第二条第一款
    编者按：中华人民共和国宪法草案规定中华人民共和国一切权力属于人民。人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。这种规定，充分说明了我们国家的民主性质，更加巩固了我国人民在国家中的主人翁地位。几年来，我国人民通过各级人民代表会议和各级人民代表大会，逐步行使了管理国家事务和地方事务的权力，进行了对于政府工作和工作人员的监督，使各项工作得到不断的改进，同时也提高了人民群众的国家主人翁的自觉。这里发表的几篇文章，就是用具体的事实，来说明人民管理国家事务、行使自己的权力的情形。
    中华人民共和国的成立，使中国人民的政治生活发生了根本的变化。几年来，广大人民群众通过各级人民代表会议和各级人民代表大会参加了国家事务的管理。
    全国基层选举之前，人民群众通过各级人民代表会议的形式，参加了国家事务的管理。各级人民代表会议是由人民群众、各民主党派、团体、机关、部队选举的代表和由各级人民政府邀请的代表组成的。几年来，各级人民代表会议中由人民直接选举和间接选举的代表逐渐增多，一般达到代表总数的百分之八十以上，有的达到百分之九十以上；特邀代表逐渐减少。进行基层选举以前，全国各级人民代表会议的代表共计达一千三百六十多万人；三分之二以上的省，三分之二以上的市，三分之一以上的县，五分之四以上的乡的人民代表会议并已逐步代行了人民代表大会的职权。
    人民群众通过人民代表会议解除了国民党反动势力强加在自己身上的束缚。几年来，在全国范围内掀起的各种政治运动和一系列民主改革工作，大都是通过人民代表会议组织和发动起来的。各地的人民代表会议同时也讨论了每一个时期的生产建设工作，作出了各种决议，组织广大人民投入了国民经济的恢复和建设工作。通过人民代表会议，人民群众实行了对政府工作和干部的监督，审查了每一时期人民政府的施政方针和工作情况，批评甚至处理了为人民群众所不满的干部。几年来实行人民代表会议的结果，人民的政治觉悟大大提高了，许多艰巨的任务，由于得到人民的充分支持而胜利完成。
    经过这次基层选举，全国即将普遍以人民代表大会来代替人民代表会议了。在基层选举运动中，广大选民都积极参加了选举，显示了人民群众的政治热情和管理国家事务的积极性。经过人口调查登记，全国人口总数是六亿零一百九十一万二千三百七十一人，登记选民总数为三亿二千三百八十万九千六百八十四人，参加投票的有两亿七千八百零九万三千一百人，占登记的选民总数的百分之八十五以上，很多地区高达百分之九十以上，有不少地区甚至达到百分之百。全国共选出基层人民代表大会的代表五百六十六万九千一百四十四人，其中妇女代表占百分之十七以上。当选的代表，都是各方面的优秀人物。北京市城内七个区当选的一千二百名代表中，工人占百分之三十二点八，干部占百分之十五点七，文教界、医务工作者占百分之十五点二，工程技术人员占百分之一点四，合作社工作者占百分之三，私营工商业者占百分之九点八，宗教职业者占百分之一点六，街道居民占百分之二十点五。这充分体现了各阶级、各阶层人民的团结合作和工人阶级的领导地位。
    各地的人民代表在人民代表大会会议召开以前，都在选民中进行了访问和座谈，认真地听取了群众的意见和要求，广泛地搜集了提案。因此，各地人民代表大会会议都收到很多提案。天津市四个区就收到一万零九百三十五件。提案中有关贯彻国家过渡时期总任务的要求、建议和批评干部的意见占了很大比重，充分反映了广大人民对于实现国家总任务和改进国家机关工作的热切期望。对所有提案，各地都进行了认真的审查和处理。
    各地人民代表受了人民的委托，深深感到责任的重大，都认真负责地对政府工作进行了讨论和审查。如江苏省江宁县人民代表大会会议听取了政府工作报告后，代表们提出了一百三十多条意见和批评。如批评政府在粮食统购统销中忽视了统销；对互助合作运动放任自流；个别地方的小学教员光拿薪不做事，一学期只教了七课书；有的银行人员下乡贷款不了解情况，甚至贷给赌钱的人拿去赌博等等。江宁县县长接受人民代表提出的批评并作了诚恳的检讨，表示将采取具体措施逐步改进工作，克服缺点。人民代表魏秀珍听了县长的检讨后说：
  “听了县长的检讨，自己心里也很惭愧，有好些工作我们人民代表都没有认真带动群众去作。”有的地方在审查政府工作时，对政府工作中存在的问题进行了讨论，提出了解决办法。如吉林省桦甸县人民代表大会会议在讨论某些农民缺少种籽的问题时，确定以互助组、合作社和村为单位，互相串换；如仍不能解决，可通过县农业科和粮食储运公司兑换。贫困户可由信贷部加以必要的扶助。
    各地人民代表大会会议都根据中心工作的要求和人民的提案，以及人民代表的批评建议，作出了决议。如抚顺市五个工矿区的居民，平均百分之九十以上是工人和工人家属。过去区人民政府对于为生产服务的方针不够明确。在前一时期召开的人民代表大会会议上，各区就根据人民代表的意见，决定今后矿区人民政府应该采取有效措施，贯彻为工业生产服务的方针。事后各区分别组织干部深入街道和工人住宅区检查和整顿了工人家属互助组，并组织了新的工人家属互助组，以保证和推动生产。四川省泸县来龙乡人民代表大会会议，决议新修堰塘五口、培修堰塘七口、修堰坎二十四条，并决议全乡每人平均积肥三千斤，发展合作社股金一千股。事后，全乡新修、培修的堰塘和堰坎已超过原决议的数目，合作社股金增加了一千二百三十股。各地人民代表大会会议的决议一经贯彻，就迅速变成了群众的行动。
    人民群众对国家事务表现了无限的关心，通过各种方式对国家机关的一切工作进行了管理和监督，每天都有许许多多的群众向国家机关写信或进行访问，批评国家机关工作中的缺点和错误，提供改进工作的建议。据一九五三年天津市三十四个单位的统计，全年接到人民来信和接待人民来访有九万多件。人民的来信来访，帮助国家机关改进了工作，克服了缺点，打击了官僚主义，也教育了干部。因为国家机关重视了人民来信、来访的处理，各地人民群众的来信、来访日渐增加，而且来信多是群众签署姓名直接投递的，由上级机关转交或匿名投递的已很少。这说明了人民群众对国家机关的信任也日益增强。
    许多地区选出人民陪审员参加了人民法院的审判工作。陪审员制度是人民审判工作的优良传统，宪法草案把它巩固、肯定下来，将使人民民主法治更加提高。几年来，审判工作在组织形式上和工作方法上都以便利人民和依靠人民为出发点，因而创造和建立了人民陪审制、集体调解、就地审判、问事处、人民接待室等群众路线的工作方法和制度，并随时根据群众运动的需要，吸收群众参加工作。如土地改革时成立人民法庭，吸收农民参加，在“五反”运动时成立人民法庭，吸收工人和工商联代表参加，培养了大批工农群众成为优秀的审判员。仅上海一地的“五反”人民法庭，就吸收了六百个工人、店员和家庭妇女参加工作。广大群众高兴地说：“开天辟地以来，从来没有像今天这样的政府，把案子交给老百姓办！”
