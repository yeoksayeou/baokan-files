    Swiftly Turning the Call for Over-Production into Mass Action
    The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    Effective Measures for Increased Production Must Be Taken

    In order to strive for over-fulfillment of increased production tasks, before August 12th, CCP prefectural committees and county committees in Zhejiang Province held emergency meetings. The vast majority of county and district committees then convened district and township cadre meetings to analyze local conditions and preliminarily propose targets and specific measures for over-production. However, the implementation varied across regions. The province can be roughly divided into three types of areas:

    First type of area: Some county committees and several district committees have initially created typical experiences and convened mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings at the township level. The masses are highly motivated, and over-production work has begun. For example, counties like Hangxian, Jinhua, and Xindeng completed county committee meetings, expanded county committee meetings, or county and district cadre meetings overnight or within a day, with clear goals and swift action. After such arrangements, the responsible cadres in these counties immediately went deep into the grassroots, focusing on key areas, creating typical experiences, and quickly implementing these experiences among the masses. For instance, after the Hangxian County Committee held an expanded meeting, it decided that each district committee secretary should leave their original location and go deep into the production cooperatives to create typical experiences and rapidly implement these experiences among the masses.

    Second type of area: Most county and district cadre meetings have just ended or have not yet ended, and the masses have not been mobilized. The main reason is that the leading cadres in these areas do not sufficiently recognize the urgency of the movement. They do not understand that if seeds are not sown before the end of the solar terms of "End of Heat" and "White Dew," the call for an additional harvest will fail. They are still using the usual step-by-step meeting method, which delays the process.

    Third type of area: Such as the Zhoushan Special District and some counties in the Wenzhou area, where meetings and implementation have been delayed due to inconvenient transportation.

    The general situation is that many regions do not sufficiently recognize the significant political and economic importance of over-fulfilling increased production tasks to support national construction and disaster-stricken people. Therefore, they have not been grasping the current increased production work tightly enough. The pressing issue now is to quickly turn increased production work into the action of the broad masses. In areas where the masses have been initially mobilized and leading cadres have preliminary experience, it is necessary to be wary of complacency and blind optimism among cadres. Timely summarize experiences, comprehensively promote them, and closely monitor to ensure that increased production work is fully unfolded and persistently implemented. Prevent the tendency to be satisfied with doing a good job in a few spots while neglecting overall leadership. In areas where county and district cadre meetings are being held, the content of the meetings should be streamlined, clear increased production goals and specific measures should be proposed, and the meetings should be quickly completed. Immediately focus on key points and create experiences for implementation. In areas where cadres and masses have not yet been mobilized, party committees at all levels should quickly send responsible cadres to assist them so that they can quickly take action.

    Great Potential for Production
    According to preliminary statistics, Zhejiang Province can over-produce a total of 1,147,810,000 jin of grain, and it is "higher and higher," with county and district increased production targets being higher than those set by the provincial and prefectural committees. This shows that the potential for agricultural production is great, and it is entirely possible to reach and exceed the targets set by the provincial committee. However, tapping potential and setting targets is easy, but realizing and exceeding these targets is still an arduous task. The central key to realizing over-production targets, in addition to strengthening the Party's leadership and fully carrying out political and ideological mobilization, is to implement the Party's guiding principle in rural work, namely, to carry out an agricultural increased production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation. The experiences of Shuanglin Township in Hangxian County, Zhenxi Township in Jiaxing County, and Xindeng, among others, all prove that it is necessary to first take agricultural production cooperatives as the center. On the basis of checking the implementation of the original production plan, educate cooperative cadres and members, overcome various ideological obstacles, tap potential, formulate plans, take the lead in action, and drive mutual aid teams and individual farmers to widely carry out the over-production movement. In Shuanglin Township, Hangxian County, taking the Jiang Hongyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative as the center, after detailed accounting and tapping potential, the conservative thinking that production has already been determined was broken. On average, each cooperative member household can strive for an additional 530 jin of production. After Jiang Hongyuan Cooperative's plan was introduced at the township mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting, many mutual aid team leaders could not sleep and held meetings overnight to discuss it. This not only greatly improved their confidence in increased production but also greatly improved their enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation. One hundred and sixty farmers in the township actively requested to join the cooperative. To over-produce, a series of problems must be solved: labor organization, mobilization of semi-able-bodied labor, solving material difficulties, and agricultural technology reform. These problems are relatively easy to solve only in agricultural production cooperatives. Mutual aid teams have certain difficulties, and individual farmers are weak and scattered, with even more difficulties. Therefore, only under the leadership of the cooperative can they be helped to overcome a series of difficulties in order to promote comprehensive increased production. At the same time, experience has proven that where the over-production movement forms a climax, a climax of cooperation will inevitably form. Therefore, the view of some cadres that puts over-production and the cooperation movement in opposition must be overcome.

    According to the experiences of Xindeng and Hangxian, a positive attitude should be taken toward farmers who request to join or establish cooperatives. All those who already meet the conditions should be allowed to join or establish cooperatives. However, in order not to affect the current production, production can be organized uniformly first, and the issues of joining procedures, land dividends, and the valuation of cattle and farm implements can be gradually resolved later during the production gaps. Among individual farmers, temporary mutual aid teams can be extensively developed to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor, cattle, and farm implements.

    Give Play to the Masses' Enthusiasm for Increased Production

    Striving to over-fulfill the increased production tasks is also an acute and complex class struggle in the countryside, as well as a struggle between advanced and conservative thinking, and a struggle between a global perspective and departmentalism. In short, it is a struggle between socialist and capitalist ideology.

    Based on the situation in various regions, the main ideological obstacles for cadres and the masses are that they believe that "the overall situation is set this year, and there is nothing that can be done," or that the season is late this year, there are many disasters, and the small-scale peasant economy still dominates, so there is no certainty of increased production. In order to overcome these erroneous ideas, in addition to relying on the masses to fully tap potential and recognize the possibility of increased production, cadres and the masses must be educated to fully recognize the serious significance of over-production. The main methods of education are to mobilize cadres and the masses to recall and compare, carefully calculate, and criticize erroneous ideas. Farmers in Qu County recalled the fact that they ate Guangdong rice after the local area was hit by disaster last year, which increased their sympathy for supporting disaster-stricken compatriots. Daqing Township in Fuyang County recalled the oppression suffered during the Kuomintang rule, which increased their enthusiasm for increasing grain production to support national construction. Hangxian County adopted four accounts: digging potential, supporting national industrialization, increasing income, and supporting disaster-stricken farmers, which also had good results. In the current increased production work, hired and poor peasants are highly motivated and act actively, but some people have difficulties such as lack of fertilizer and seeds, which urgently need to be solved. While middle peasants want to increase production, they also have some concerns, such as fearing increased taxes, and eating coarse grains if they increase coarse grain production, showing hesitation and wavering. Some rich peasants are passively resisting, storing seeds and not selling them, not applying fertilizer, and some are even carrying out sabotage activities. Therefore, to carry out the over-production movement, it is necessary to fully utilize the enthusiasm of the poor peasants, convene meetings of activists mainly composed of poor peasants, help them overcome difficulties, and make them the backbone of the movement. Patiently educate the middle peasants, so that they clearly understand that increased production is not only beneficial to the country, but first of all, it is beneficial to themselves, explain the policy of no tax increase for increased production, explain the state's reasonable price policy for unified purchase of grain, and the method of collecting both rice and coarse grains to eliminate their concerns and give play to their enthusiasm for increased production. The rich peasants should also be educated in the same way, criticize their passive resistance, and take necessary measures to stop those who can increase production but deliberately resist.

    To fully implement the Party's class line in the countryside, it is necessary to give play to the Party's leading role in the countryside, give play to the Youth League's active leading role, and fully mobilize men, women, and semi-able-bodied laborers to strive to over-fulfill the increased production tasks. The Party branch of Beizhuang Township in Siwei District, Hangxian County, after seeing the provincial committee's instructions published in the Zhejiang Daily, immediately discussed and deployed them. The Hangxian County Committee has called on all Party branches in the county to learn from them, discuss the provincial committee's instructions, and lead the local masses to over-fulfill the increased production tasks. The approach of the Party committees in these regions to attach importance to giving play to the Party's leading role is good. In the current increased production work, Party committees at all levels should attach importance to summing up the experience of giving play to the leading role of Party branches, and those with good Party branches and significant achievements should be commended in newspapers. The good experience of the Youth League in launching increased production should also be actively promoted.

    Solve the Difficulties in Increased Production Work

    There are many difficulties in striving to over-fulfill the increased production tasks, which must be solved quickly and effectively. According to reports from various regions in Zhejiang, there are many difficulties in seeds, fertilizers, labor, and technology. In particular, if the seed problem is not solved in time and the planting season is missed, the over-production task will not be completed. To solve these difficulties, it is necessary to take measures suitable to local conditions. There are basically two ways to solve the seed problem: one is that the local area does not lack seeds or has a surplus (such as Jinhua and Quzhou regions), the main thing is to mobilize the masses to carry out adjustments of what is available and what is not, and to support other regions as much as possible; the other is that the local area lacks seeds and needs to be adjusted from other places (such as Jiaxing region), which requires the active efforts of agricultural and forestry departments, grain departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels to ensure supply as much as possible, and to mobilize the masses as much as possible to find ways to purchase from other places on their own. If there are no high-yield crop seeds, lower-yield crops can also be planted when necessary. Secondly, all regions should strengthen their leadership over the cooperatives to ensure that the fertilizer supply is well done, and timely solve the farmers' needs for commercial fertilizers. At the same time, they should vigorously call on farmers to increase the application of local fertilizer. It must be recognized that increasing fertilizer application is a very important way to increase crop yields. According to a report from the Jiaxing Prefectural Committee, 1.2 million mu of late rice in this region did not receive topdressing last year. If fertilizer is applied once more this year, each mu can increase production by 50 jin, for a total increase of 60 million jin. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen technical guidance, especially for advanced production technologies, to rely on key points, set examples, organize visits, introduce them widely, and give full play to the role of technology promotion stations.

    When solving these difficulties, all regions should strive for self-reliance and overcome the idea of simply relying on others. At the same time, the provincial leading departments should also vigorously support all regions.

    迅速地把超额增产的号召变成群众的行动
    中共浙江省委员会
    必须采取有效的增产措施
    为了争取超额完成增产任务，八月十二日以前，浙江省各地中共地委、县委都召开了紧急会议，绝大多数县委、区委紧接着又召开了区乡干部大会，分析了本地的情况，初步地提出了超额增产指标和具体措施。但各地贯彻情况不平衡，全省大致上可分为三类地区：
    第一种类型地区：部分县委及若干区委已初步创造了典型经验，并以乡为单位召开了互助合作代表会议。群众情绪高涨，超额增产工作已初步展开。如杭县、金华、新登等县，都连夜或以一天时间开完了县委会、县委扩大会或县区干部大会，目标明确，迅速有力。经过这样布置以后，这些县的负责干部又立即深入基层，抓住重点，创造典型经验，推动全局。如杭县县委召开扩大会议后，决定各区区委书记均离开原驻地，深入生产合作社，创造典型经验，并把这些经验迅速贯彻到群众中去。
    第二种类型地区：大多数县区干部会议刚结束，或尚未结束，群众没有发动。主要原因是这些地区的领导干部对运动的突击性认识不足，不懂得在处暑、白露之前如果播不下种子，则增加一熟的号召，即将落空。他们仍采取平时的按部就班层层开会的方法拖迟了时间。
    第三种类型地区：如舟山专区及温州地区部分县，因交通不便，开会贯彻较迟。
    总的情况是不少地区对超额完成增产任务，对支援国家建设，支援灾区人民需要的重大政治意义与经济意义认识不足，因此对目前的增产工作抓得不够紧。当前的迫切问题是必须迅速地使增产工作成为广大群众的行动，凡群众已经初步发动，领导干部已经有了初步经验的地区，要警惕干部的盲目自满麻痹思想，及时总结经验，全面推广，抓紧检查，使增产工作全面展开并持久地贯彻下去，防止满足于搞好几个点，而放松全面领导的偏向；凡正在开县区干部会议的地区，要精简会议内容，提出明确的增产目标和具体措施，迅速把会开好，并立即抓重点，创造贯彻的经验；凡干部群众尚未动员起来的地区，各级党委要迅速派出负责干部，予以帮助，使之迅速行动起来。
    生产潜力很大
    根据初步统计，浙江全省共可超额增产粮食十一亿四千七百八十一万斤，而且“一层高一层”，县区增产指标均比省委，地委为高。这说明农业生产潜力是很大的，达到并超过省委提出的指标是完全可能的。但挖潜力、订指标是容易的，实现并超过这些指标还是一个艰巨的任务。实现超额增产指标的中心关键，除加强党的领导，充分作好政治思想动员外，主要是贯彻党在农村工作中的领导方针，即开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。杭县双林乡，嘉兴县镇西乡以及新登等地的经验都证明：必须首先以农业生产合作社为中心，在检查原定生产计划执行情况的基础上，教育社干部和社员，克服各种思想障碍，挖掘潜力，制订计划，带头行动，并带动互助组和单干农民广泛地开展超额增产运动。杭县双林乡，以江洪元农业生产合作社为中心，经过算细账，挖潜力，打破了认为生产已成定局的保守思想，平均每户社员可以争取超额增产五百三十斤。江洪元社的计划在乡的互助合作代表会议上介绍后，许多互助组长睡不着觉，连夜开会讨论，不仅大大提高了他们的增产信心，而且大大提高了他们的互助合作积极性。全乡有一百六十户农民积极要求参加合作社。要超额增产必须解决一系列的问题：劳力组织问题，半劳力发动问题，解决物质困难问题，农业技术改革问题。这些问题，只有农业生产合作社才比较好解决，互助组就有一定的困难，单干农民身单力薄，分散经营，困难更多。因此，只有在合作社的带动下，帮助他们克服一系列的困难，才能推动全面增产。同时经验证明，那里超额增产运动形成高潮，那里也必然形成合作化的高潮。因此，必须克服一部分干部把超额增产和合作化运动对立起来的看法。
    对要求入社或建社的农民，应根据新登、杭县的经验，采取积极的态度。凡是已经具备条件的，均应允许其入社或建社，但为了不影响当前生产，可先统一组织进行生产，对入社手续、土地分红、耕牛农具折价等问题，可留待以后在生产空隙中逐步解决。在个体农民中，目前可大量发展临时互助组，以解决劳力、耕牛、农具不足的困难。
    发挥群众的增产积极性
    争取超额完成增产任务，在农村中同样是一场尖锐的复杂的阶级斗争，也是先进思想和保守思想的斗争，全局观点和本位思想的斗争，总之，是社会主义思想和资本主义思想的斗争。
    综合各地情况，干部、群众的主要思想障碍是认为今年“大局已定，无能为力”，或者认为，今年季节已晚，灾害又多，小农经济还占优势，增产没有把握。为了克服这些错误思想，除依靠群众充分挖掘潜力认识增产的可能性外，必须教育干部、群众完整地认识超额增产的严重意义。教育方法主要是发动干部群众回忆对比，算细账，批判错误思想等。衢县农民回忆了去年本地受灾后吃广东大米的事实，提高了支援灾区同胞的同情心；富阳县大青乡回忆了国民党统治时期遭受的压迫，提高了增产粮食支援国家建设的积极性；杭县采取算四笔账——挖潜力账，支援国家工业化账，增加收入账，支援灾区农民账，收效也很好。在目前的增产工作中，雇贫农情绪高涨，积极行动，但有一部分人有缺乏肥料、种子等困难，亟需解决；中农一面想增产，一面又有若干顾虑，如害怕增产增税，增产杂粮吃杂粮等，表现犹豫动摇；富农有的消极对抗，存种不卖，有肥不施，个别还有进行破坏活动的。因此，开展超额增产运动，必须充分发挥贫农的积极性，召开以贫农为主的积极分子会议，帮助他们克服困难，使他们成为运动的骨干力量。耐心地教育中农，使他们明确增产不但对国家有利，而且首先是对他们自己有利，说明增产不增税的政策，说明国家统购粮食的合理价格政策，和水稻杂粮兼收的办法，消除他们的顾虑，发挥他们的增产积极性。对富农要同样进行教育，批评他们消极对抗的作法，对个别可以增产而故意对抗的应采取必要办法，予以制止。
    要完整地贯彻党在农村的阶级路线，必须发挥党在农村的领导作用，发挥青年团的积极带头作用，把男女整半劳力全面地动员起来，力争超额完成增产任务。杭县四维区北庄乡党的支部，看到浙江日报公布省委指示后，即自动讨论布置，杭县县委已号召全县党支部向他们学习，讨论省委指示，领导当地群众超额完成增产任务。衢县县委发出告全县农村党员书，号召党的组织响应上级号召，展开以互助合作为中心的超额增产运动。这些地区的党委重视发挥党的领导作用的作法是好的。在目前的增产工作中，各地党委应重视总结发挥党支部领导作用的经验，对好的党支部，有显著成绩的要登报表扬，对青年团发动增产的好经验也要积极推广。
      解决增产工作中的困难
    争取超额完成增产任务的困难是很多的，必须迅速切实加以解决。根据浙江各地反映，种子、肥料、劳力、技术等困难都很多，特别是种子问题，如不及时解决，错过播种季节，将使超额增产任务不能完成。解决这些困难，必须采取因地制宜的办法。解决种子的办法，基本上有两种：一种是本地不缺种或有多余（如金华、衢州等地区），主要是发动群众，进行有无调剂，并尽可能支援其他地区；一种是本地缺种，须从外地调剂（如嘉兴等地区），要依靠各级农林、粮食部门和供销合作社积极努力，尽可能保证供应，并尽量发动群众，自行设法从外地购买。没有高产量作物种子，必要时也可以播种较低产量作物。其次，各地应加强对合作社的领导，保证作好肥料供应工作，及时解决农民对商品肥料的需要，同时应当大力号召农民增施土肥。必须认识，增施肥料是提高农作物产量的一个很重要的办法。根据嘉兴地委的报告，这个区有一百二十万亩晚稻去年未施追肥，今年如多施一次肥，每亩可增产五十斤，共可增产六千万斤。此外，还必须加强技术指导，特别对先进的生产技术，要分段分期，依靠重点，作出样子，组织参观，广为介绍，充分发挥技术推广站的作用。
    在解决这些困难时，各地要力求自力更生，克服单纯依赖思想，同时省的领导部门也要大力给各地以支持。
