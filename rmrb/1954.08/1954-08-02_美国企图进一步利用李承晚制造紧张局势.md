Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch:
　　The talks between Eisenhower and Syngman Rhee concluded on the 30th, and a communique was issued stating that they would continue to implement the policy of "unifying" Korea by Syngman Rhee. The communique also announced that the military and economic advisors of the United States and South Korea would continue to conduct more detailed discussions on relevant issues. On the 29th, Syngman Rhee and Eisenhower held their second meeting, attended by top U.S. military and political officials. According to Syngman Rhee's announcement after the meeting, the talks discussed the military and economic problems of South Korea. Indications suggest that the United States is preparing to strengthen the position of the Syngman Rhee puppet from these two aspects and use this to instigate the Syngman Rhee gang to intensify its threats to the stability of the Korean armistice and create tension in Asia.
　　Under the direct encouragement of the U.S. authorities, Syngman Rhee has been issuing warmongering cries in Washington for days. The peace-hostile and mad nature of these cries fully exposes the conspiracy being plotted between the U.S. and Syngman Rhee. Immediately after his first meeting with Eisenhower on the 27th, Syngman Rhee told reporters that "it is impossible to unify Korea by peaceful means." He pointed out that achieving the "unified" Korea goal set by the United States would require resuming the Korean War. On the 28th, Syngman Rhee delivered a speech in the U.S. Congress, again clamoring that the "Korean armistice should be declared dead" and immediately expand the South Korean puppet army, preparing to launch an attack on Korea and China with the support of the U.S. Air Force and Navy. In his true colors as an American lackey, Syngman Rhee "guaranteed" his American master that with South Korean manpower acting as cannon fodder for the U.S. in its aggressive wars, "there would be no need for American soldiers to fight on the Korean battlefield." He also advocated launching a full-scale war of aggression in the Far East as soon as possible. He tried his best to echo the U.S. authorities' policy of "using Asians to fight Asians," advocating that the United States organize an "Asian army" to attack the People's Republic of China.
　　Syngman Rhee, who is trying his best to show loyalty to his American master, has been favored by Washington. Eisenhower called him a "true comrade-in-arms" of the United States. Senator Wiley, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised Syngman Rhee as being "filled with American ideals." News from American newspapers and news agencies shows that Syngman Rhee is using his flattery and service to the U.S. master to win more U.S. military and economic aid. According to columnist Allen, Syngman Rhee has received "definite guarantees" from Washington regarding the increase in U.S. military and economic "aid." Allen said that the United States currently spends more than $800 million annually on various expenses in South Korea, and according to the new plan, this total will increase to more than $1 billion. According to an Associated Press report, the U.S. and South Korea have reached an agreement on the U.S. strengthening South Korea's military strength, which will include jet aircraft, warships, and a reserve army.
　　The situation of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee talks shows that the U.S. authorities are arranging to further exploit Syngman Rhee to deepen the instability of the Korean armistice and increase the threat to the security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China. However, there is also another reaction in the U.S. Congress to Syngman Rhee's adventurous gambling. After listening to Syngman Rhee's war cries, Senator Case, a Republican member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, while praising him, also commented: "I am worried that the key points of the plan he put forward, although well spoken, are not so simple in reality."

    美国企图进一步利用李承晚制造紧张局势
    【新华社三十一日讯】艾森豪威尔和李承晚之间的会谈在三十日结束，发表了一个公报，表示仍要继续执行由李承晚来“统一”朝鲜的政策。公报并宣布美李双方的军事和经济顾问将继续就有关问题进行更详细的讨论。二十九日，李承晚和艾森豪威尔在美国最高负责军政官员参加下举行了第二次会议。据李承晚会后宣布，会谈讨论了南朝鲜的军事和经济问题。迹象表明，美国正准备从这两方面来加强李承晚走狗的地位，并借此唆使李承晚匪帮变本加厉地威胁朝鲜停战的稳定和制造亚洲的紧张局势。
    在美国当局的直接鼓励下，李承晚连日在华盛顿发出好战的叫嚣，这种叫嚣的敌视和平的疯狂性质，充分暴露了美李之间正在策划的阴谋。李承晚在二十七日和艾森豪威尔第一次会谈以后立即对记者表示，“以和平的方法统一朝鲜是没有可能的。”他指出，要实现美国所规定的“统一”朝鲜的目标就需要恢复朝鲜战争。二十八日，李承晚在美国国会中发表演说，又叫嚷着应该“宣布朝鲜停战已经寿终正寝”，并立即扩充南朝鲜伪军，准备在美国海空军支持下，对朝中两国发动进攻。李承晚以其美国走狗的本色，向美国主子“保证”：有了南朝鲜人力来充当美国进行侵略战争的炮灰，“就不再需要美国军人到朝鲜战场上去作战”。他还鼓吹在远东迅速发动全面的侵略战争。他竭力附和美国当局“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策，主张由美国组织一支“亚洲军队”来进攻中华人民共和国。
    竭力对美国主子表示忠诚的李承晚，受到了华盛顿的青睐。艾森豪威尔把他叫做美国的“真正的战友”。参议院外交委员会主席维利赞扬李承晚
  “充满了美国人的理想”。美国报纸和通讯社的消息显示，李承晚正以他对美国主子的献媚和效劳来博得美国给予更大量的军事和经济援助。据专栏作家艾伦透露，关于增加美国军事和经济“援助”一点，李承晚已得到华盛顿“肯定的保证”。艾伦说，目前美国每年花在南朝鲜的各种费用共达八亿美元以上，根据新的计划，这个总数将增加到十亿以上。另据美联社消息说，美李已达成了一项美国加强南朝鲜军力的协议，内容将包括喷气式飞机、军舰和一支后备陆军。
    美李会谈的情况说明，美国当局正在安排进一步利用李承晚来加深朝鲜停战的不稳定状态并增加对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中国的安全的威胁。但是对于李承晚的冒险的赌博，美国国会中也有一种另外的反应。美国参议院军事委员会委员、共和党参议员凯斯在听了李承晚的战争叫嚣之后，在称赞之余，还评论说：“我担心他所提出的计划要点说得虽然很好，真实却极不那么简单。”
