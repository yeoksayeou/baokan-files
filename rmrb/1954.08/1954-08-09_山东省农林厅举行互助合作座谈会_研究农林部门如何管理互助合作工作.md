    Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry Holds Mutual Aid and Cooperation Symposium
    To Study How Agricultural and Forestry Departments Can Manage Mutual Aid and Cooperation Work
    The Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry held a mutual aid and cooperation symposium from July 6th to 17th, focusing on how agricultural and forestry departments can manage mutual aid and cooperation work. Participants were cadres from various special districts and key counties responsible for mutual aid and cooperation work.
    In the past, agricultural and forestry departments at all levels in Shandong Province did not manage mutual aid and cooperation work very well. Although some special districts and counties had full-time personnel, they were mostly limited to collecting information from relevant departments and did not specifically grasp the business. After this symposium discussion, everyone believed that it is necessary to strengthen management work in order to consolidate and improve the existing more than 20,000 agricultural producer cooperatives and a large number of mutual aid teams. In terms of specific work: first, it is necessary to strengthen the guidance of financial accounting work of agricultural producer cooperatives and the training of accounting personnel. The province plans to hold an accounting instructor training class in the near future, and each county will strive to train the accountants of the existing cooperatives before the autumn harvest to prepare for the autumn harvest distribution. Where conditions permit, the experience of accounting exchange networks or accounting mutual aid networks will be tried out, and the method of taking on apprentices can also be used to train junior high school graduates within the cooperatives to become accountants. Secondly, we should unify the organization of forces, go deep into the base points originally set up by the Party committees, and help the groups and cooperatives to do a good job in production. And, in light of local conditions, grasp the key to increasing production, improve production technology, and solve the problem of surplus labor. At present, efforts should be concentrated on doing a good job in inter-tillage, weeding, accumulating manure, and fighting against various natural disasters. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen the connection between upper and lower levels. When agricultural and forestry departments at all levels report to the Party and government leaders at the same level and the agricultural and forestry departments at the higher level, they should include mutual aid and cooperation as one of the main contents.

    山东省农林厅举行互助合作座谈会
    研究农林部门如何管理互助合作工作
    山东省农林厅于七月六日到十七日举行了互助合作座谈会，着重研究农林部门如何管理互助合作工作，参加会议的是各专区及重点县负责互助合作工作的干部。
    山东省各级农林部门过去对互助合作工作没有很好管理，个别专区、县虽设有专职人员，也大都限于向有关部门搜集资料，没有具体掌握业务。经过这次座谈讨论，大家认为必须加强管理工作，以巩固、提高现有的两万多个农业生产合作社和大量的互助组。具体工作方面：首先要加强对农业生产合作社财务会计工作的指导和会计人员的训练，省里计划在最近举办会计辅导员训练班，各县在秋收前争取将现有社的会计普训一遍，为秋收分配作好准备。有条件的地方并准备试行会计交流网或会计互助网的经验，也可用带徒弟的办法，培养社内高小毕业生做会计。其次应统一组织力量，深入党委原设基点，帮助组、社搞好生产。并因地制宜地抓住增产关键，提高增产技术，解决剩余劳动力等问题。目前应集中力量搞好中耕、除草、积肥，和各种自然灾害作斗争。此外，还要加强上下联系，各级农林部门向同级党政领导和上级农林部门作报告时，应把互助合作列为主要内容之一。（高庄）
