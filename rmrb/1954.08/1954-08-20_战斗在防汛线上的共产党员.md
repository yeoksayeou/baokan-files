Communist Party Members Fighting on the Flood Control Line

    Intense Battle
    Communist Party member Luo Guangtian is a model soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He prominently demonstrated the noble quality of selflessness in the flood control work in Wuhan. On July 27, the unit braved the wind and rain to rush to Zhanggong Horizontal Embankment to repair a dangerous section. Luo Guangtian was in the water stacking sacks for eight hours. On the 29th, the wind and rain were even greater, and the waves were more than a meter high. At five o'clock in the morning, Luo Guangtian went to the Zhongwan Dike to work with his unit. At this time, a section of the dike collapsed severely. Luo Guangtian was the first to jump into the water and use his body to block the breach. The waves washed away the sacks on the dike, so he lay in the breach, blocking the impact of the waves on the breach. Then, more than 30 soldiers jumped into the water one after another, forming a wall with their bodies to protect the dike. When using sacks to block the breach, he insisted on plugging other breaches first, so that other comrades could get out of the water first. At noon, he only ate half a bowl of rice and went back to the dike. He found that the sacks in the breach had been washed away by the waves, so he used reeds to plug the breach himself, and then lay on the reeds to protect the dike. He persisted in this way until after 4 pm. The flood control headquarters transported bricks, and after he packed the bricks in sacks and filled the breach, it was already 6 pm. On this day, Luo Guangtian fought fiercely against the wind and waves for twelve hours, finally preventing the dangerous situation from expanding and maintaining the safety of the dike. His body was scraped by the reed stumps, and his bones were also bruised. When work was over in the evening, he was in pain all over and fainted on the road. He was sent back to the unit. On this day, he only ate half a bowl of rice. Because he was in pain all over, he didn't sleep all night. The next day, he still went to the dike with everyone.
    Guarding the Dike
    Communist Party member Wang Wancang, the company commander of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, is the captain of the fourth squad of the fourth section of the Hankou Flood Control Headquarters. The Mayang Street intersection dike in this section is one of the concentration points of flood impact. Guarding this section of the dike is a very arduous task. Wang Wancang guarded the dike vigilantly, regardless of dawn or dusk. Whenever there was a windy and rainy night, or when the water level rose, he personally went to check the dike body. When his clothes were soaked, he wrung them out and put them back on.
    The intense rescue and relief struggle began on July 29. In such a strong wind and rain, Wang Wancang forgot that he was suffering from a cold and jumped into the chest-deep water to pile stones against the waves. The waves knocked him down, and the water submerged the top of his head, but as soon as the wave passed, he got up and continued to pile stones. From 8 am to 1 pm, he was immersed in the water. After five hours of fighting, he finally blocked the flood. After the rescue, Wang Wancang accepted a new task: to repair the waterproof wall, and persisted from 7 pm to 3 am. Wang Wancang linked the flood control struggle with the past operations against the enemy, and said: "Not afraid of the thousand-mile snow in the Fortress North, why fear the cold water of the Yangtze River", fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of the people's soldiers.
    Cherishing Flood Control Materials
    Communist Party member Wang Maoshan is the stationmaster of the sixth transportation station of the Wuhan Transportation Company. During the flood control work in Wuhan, he led the transportation workers to undertake the task of protecting the dike from Longwang Temple to Jijiazui. He cherishes flood control equipment very much. He always mobilized the workers in his section to pick up, wash, and dry any unused sacks discarded nearby to save state property. On July 22, during the rescue at Siguan Temple, he mobilized the masses to take a batch of broken sacks discarded on the road by other units and use them in the flood control project, saving four or five hundred new sacks. He also paid great attention to publicizing the great significance of flood control work to the workers, improving everyone's ideological understanding; coupled with his own example of selfless and hardworking work style, he further encouraged and educated the workers who worked with him. He also created many heroic deeds in aspects such as carrying soil, building dikes, patrolling and rushing to repair dangerous areas. Once, when workers were inspecting the dike, they found a leak in the dike body near Siguan Temple. Wang Maoshan immediately reported it to the leaders of the work section, and led four workers to jump into the water to check the dangerous situation at 11 pm that day. This dangerous area was originally a toilet, with sewage up to their chests. They groped in it for three or four hours without finding the leak. At four o'clock the next morning, Wang Maoshan went down again and groped for more than an hour, but still to no avail. At this time, his legs had been swollen by the sewage and mud, and his toes were also festering, but he continued to jump into the sewage with another Communist Party member, Tan Qimao, to find the leak. In a deep water area, their feet slipped into the mud pit, and the sewage covered their heads. After they climbed out, they continued to look for the leak. Finally, they found the leak. After Wang Maoshan came out, he immediately drew a sketch based on his memory and handed it to the flood control section. The flood control section studied the rescue plan based on this drawing, turning the dike from danger to safety.
    Closely Unite the Masses
    Yuan Xiuzhen is an 18-year-old female Communist Party member and the township head of Hezuo Township in Huiji District, Wuhan City. During this flood control, she served as the deputy head of the Hezuo section of the Hankou First Flood Control Headquarters and also as the captain of the rescue brigade.
    During the flood control period, Yuan Xiuzhen often had to patiently mobilize 200 to 500 workers to go to the dike. Because the number of workers required on the dike varied, it caused dissatisfaction among some workers. Yuan Xiuzhen persuaded and explained to them. Yuan Xiuzhen cared very much about the lives and demands of the workers, so the workers were willing to raise their opinions to Yuan Xiuzhen.
    Yuan Xiuzhen fully demonstrated the spirit of friendship and cooperation in the flood control work. After the flood control organization of the Hezuo section was established, she took the initiative to introduce the situation of her township to the newly arrived cadres, so that everyone quickly became familiar with the situation and quickly carried out the work. She often said to the masses: "Since people have come to our place to do flood control work, we local people should do our best to help them so that we can do a good job in flood control together." When there were no lights for rescue at night, she took the initiative to run to the Hezuo Cooperative in Huiji District to borrow 18 catties of kerosene and made torches to solve the lighting problem. In order to find out the dangerous conditions and hidden dangers, the work section leaders needed to hold "old farmer symposiums". Yuan Xiuzhen personally connected with ten old farmers and held two "old farmer symposiums." The old farmers provided valuable information and suggestions on the history of the dike body, the weaknesses of the dike body, the key dangerous areas, and how to rescue them. These two meetings were of great help to the work section leaders and engineering technicians.
    In the flood control struggle, Yuan Xiuzhen demonstrated the noble qualities of disregarding herself and avoiding hardship. On June 25, there was a dangerous situation at the Jinkou Pumping Station. She persisted in the wind and rain for a day and a night to complete the rescue mission. From July 8 to July 11 was the most urgent time to build and protect the dike. Yuan Xiuzhen ran back and forth on the dike, leading everyone to work, regardless of the wind, rain, and darkness, for four consecutive days and nights without sleeping. Yuan Xiuzhen fell ill on July 21. The next day, her illness was not completely cured, and she went to work at the construction site again. She said: "A little illness doesn't matter." Her selfless work performance educated many cadres and the masses.
    Selflessly Rushing to Rescue
    Le Jinyuan is a construction worker and Youth League member of the Second Engineering Company of Central and Southern China. He participated in the diving team of the rescue team in the Wuhan flood control struggle and demonstrated the excellent qualities of heroism, tenacity, and selflessness. He has now become a glorious Communist Party member.
    On July 27, the Yangtze River water level was very high. There was a torrential rain and wind, and huge waves were churning, fiercely impacting the dike. The sacks and stones used to protect the dike were washed away by the waves. If they were not repaired immediately, the water would wash the cracks and holes in the dike, and flood into the dike. At this time, Le Jinyuan and the comrades of the diving team jumped into the water to rescue without hesitation. They were constantly knocked down by the waves in the water, and the torrential rain made it impossible to open their eyes. At this time, Le Jinyuan found that the mouth of a sack underwater had been washed open, the stones were gone, and the hole was exposed. He quickly tied up the mouth of the sack, and then lifted a large stone weighing more than one hundred catties with another comrade to press the sack. A large wave came over and knocked the comrade down. The large stone rolled down and pressed on Le Jinyuan's finger. At that time, Le Jinyuan felt a little pain, but in order to quickly press the sack, he ignored it and continued to move the stone. A comrade next to him saw it and shouted: "Le Jinyuan, your finger is broken!" Le Jinyuan raised his hand and saw that the front section of his middle finger was broken, but it had not fallen off, revealing a circle of white bones, and blood was flowing. The comrades next to him were stunned. At this time, the hole was washed even larger by the waves, and water was flowing straight in. Le Jinyuan thought: It doesn't matter if a section of my finger is broken. Many people still work the same way after their fingers are broken. The volunteers can sacrifice their lives to defend the motherland. What is my small injury? He said to his comrades: "It doesn't matter, it's okay!" Then he went to move stones to press the sacks and block the holes. Deputy Captain Ye Dunfu wanted to help him to the medical station, but Le Jinyuan insisted on pressing the sacks before going with him. Ye Dunfu was so moved that tears flowed down; he asked Le Jinyuan: "Does it hurt?" Le Jinyuan felt very painful, but he was afraid that everyone would feel uncomfortable if he said it, so he said: "It hurts a little!" During the operation at the clinic, Le Jinyuan was still thinking about the dangerous situation on the dike. He said to his comrades: "I don't hurt, you go to rescue! What is the loss of one finger, as long as Wuhan can be saved!"
    During the three days of rest in the workers' shed, Le Jinyuan kept asking to do some light work, but the organization did not approve it. In fact, his arms had been swollen very high for those two days, and the wound was still bleeding sometimes, and he could not sleep at night because of the pain. Le Jinyuan was afraid that the comrades would know about it and affect their work, so he endured the pain and said nothing. On July 31, the organization sent Le Jinyuan to the hospital. In the hospital, he remembered the situation in the past when he was cutting firewood for the landlord and got injured and no one cared, and he thought about the current care and love that the Party and comrades had for him, and he was determined to respond to the care of the Party and comrades with practical actions. After resting in the hospital for five or six days, he couldn't bear it any longer, so he ran back to the dike and asked to be assigned work. Because his injury had not healed, the organization asked him to return to the hospital, but he resolutely refused to go back and voluntarily participated in the dike patrol work.

    战斗在防汛线上的共产党员
    紧张的战斗
    共产党员罗光田，是中国人民解放军某部的模范战士，他在武汉市的防汛工作中，突出地表现了奋不顾身的高贵品质。七月二十七日，部队冒风雨赶到张公横堤抢修险工，罗光田一直在水里叠了八个钟头的麻包。二十九日，风雨更大了，浪头有一人多高。清早五点钟，罗光田随部队到了中湾堤防上工作。这时，有一段堤身崩垮得很厉害，罗光田第一个跳到水里用自己的身体堵住漏洞。浪头把堤上的麻包冲走了，他就躺在缺口里，阻挡住浪头对缺口的冲击；接着又有三十多个战士纷纷跳下水去，用身体筑成了一道墙，保护着堤防。在用麻包堵塞缺口时，他又坚持先塞别处的缺口，好让其他同志先出水。中午，他只吃了半碗饭就又上了堤，发现塞在缺口里的麻包又被浪头卷走了，他就一个人用芦柴塞住缺口，然后躺在芦柴上，保护着堤身。这样，一直坚持到下午四时多。防汛指挥部运来了砖块，等他又把砖块装在麻包里塞好了缺口以后，已是下午六点钟了。这天，罗光田和大风浪进行了十二个钟头的紧张的战斗，终于使险情没有扩大，保持了堤防安全。他的身体被芦柴树桩磨烂了，骨头也碰伤了，到晚上收工的时候，他浑身都痛，昏倒在路上，被人送回部队来。这一天，他只吃了半碗饭，因为浑身发痛，一夜也没有睡着，第二天，他仍跟大家一起到堤上去了。
    守卫着堤防
    中国人民解放军某部连长共产党员王万仓，是汉口第四防汛指挥部第四段抢险中队队长。这一段的麻阳街口堤防是洪水冲击的集中点之一，守住这一段堤防，是非常艰巨的任务。王万仓不管清晨、深夜，警惕地守卫着堤防。每逢风雨之夜，或者水位上涨的时候，他都是亲自去检查堤身。衣服淋透了，拧干了再穿上。
    七月二十九日展开了紧张的抢险斗争，在那样的大风雨里，王万仓忘记了自己正患着感冒，跳入齐胸深的水中，迎着大浪堆砌石头，浪头把他打倒了，水淹没了他的头顶，但浪头一过去，他又爬起来继续砌石头。从上午八时到下午一时，他一直浸在水里，经过五小时的搏斗，终于堵住了洪水。抢险之后，王万仓又接受了新的任务：抢修防水墙，从傍晚七时一直坚持到深夜三时。王万仓从防汛斗争，联想到过去的对敌作战，他说：“不怕塞北千里雪，何惧扬子江水寒”，充分表现了人民战士的英雄气概。
      爱护防汛器材
    共产党员王茂山，是武汉市搬运公司第六搬运站站长。这次在武汉市防汛工作中，他带领搬运工人，担负着从龙王庙到集稼嘴一带的护堤任务。他十分爱护防汛器材。别人在附近丢的一些不用的麻袋，他总是动员本段工人拾起来洗净晒干，以节省国家财产。七月二十二日，在四官殿附近抢险时，他发动群众把别的单位丢在路上的一批破麻袋，拿来用在防汛工程上，节省了四、五百条新麻袋。他还非常注意向工人宣传防汛工作的重大意义，提高大家的思想认识；加上他自己以身作则，不辞艰苦的工作作风，更加鼓舞和教育了和他一起工作的工人。他在挑土、筑堤、巡逻抢险等方面也创造了许多英雄事迹。有一次，工人巡查堤防时，发现四官殿附近堤身漏水，王茂山即刻报告了工段的领导，并于当天晚上十一时带领四个工人跳下水去检查险情。这一险地原是一座厕所，里面污水齐胸。他们在里边摸索了三四个小时也没有摸清漏洞在什么地方。第二天早上四时，王茂山自己又下去摸了一个多钟头，仍然没有结果。这时他的两腿已被污泥臭水泡肿了，脚趾也泡烂了，但他又继续和另一个共产党员谭起茂跳进污水里去寻找漏洞。在一个水深的地方，他们的脚滑进了烂泥坑，污水漫过了他们的头顶。他们爬出来后，继续寻找漏洞。最后他们终于摸清了漏洞。王茂山出来以后，凭着记忆立刻绘了一张图样交给防汛段上。防汛段根据这个图样，研究出了抢险的办法，使大堤转危为安。
    紧密地团结群众
    袁秀珍是一个十八岁的女共产党员，是武汉市惠济区合作乡乡长。这次防汛中，她担任了汉口第一防汛指挥部合作段副段长，并兼抢险大队队长。
    在防汛期间，袁秀珍要经常耐心地动员民工二百到五百人上堤。因为堤防上所需民工数量不一，曾引起某些民工的不满。袁秀珍便向她们进行说服解释。袁秀珍非常关心民工的生活和要求，因而民工有了意见都愿意向袁秀珍提出来。
    袁秀珍在防汛工作中，充分表现了友爱合作的精神，当合作段防汛组织机构建立后，她就主动地将本乡情况介绍给新来的干部，让大家很快地熟悉了情况，迅速地开展了工作。她经常对群众说：
  “人家到我们这里来做防汛工作，我们当地的人应该尽力帮助，才能一起搞好防汛工作。”晚上抢险没有灯，她就主动跑到惠济区合作社借了十八斤煤油，做成火炬，解决了照明问题。为了摸清险情隐患，工段领导上需要召开“老农座谈会”，袁秀珍亲自串连了十个老农民，开了两次“老农座谈会”。老农对堤身的历史、堤身的弱点、重点险区及如何抢救等问题都提供了可贵的资料和建议。这两次会议对工段领导和工程技术人员有很大帮助。
    在防汛斗争中，袁秀珍表现了不顾自己、不避艰苦的高贵品质。六月二十五日，禁口抽水机站有险工，她在风雨中坚持了一天一夜完成了抢险任务。从七月八日到七月十一日是筑堤和护堤最紧急的时候，袁秀珍不顾风雨和黑夜，在堤上跑来跑去领着大家干活，一连四天四夜没有睡觉。七月二十一日袁秀珍病了。第二天她的病还没有全好，就又到工地去工作了。她说：“一点小病不要紧”。她这种忘我的工作表现，教育了很多干部和群众。
    忘我地抢险
    乐金元是中南第二工程公司的建筑工人，青年团员。他在武汉市防汛斗争中参加了抢险队潜水组工作，表现了英勇、顽强、忘我的优良品质，现已成为一个光荣的共产党员。
    七月二十七日那天，长江水位很高，暴风骤雨，巨浪翻腾，凶猛地冲击着堤防。护堤用的麻包和石头都被大浪冲开了，如果不马上抢修，水就会把堤防的裂缝、洞口冲大，灌到堤内来。这时乐金元和潜水组的同志们毫不踌躇地跳进水里去抢险。他们在水中不断被大浪打倒，被暴风雨打得睁不开眼，这时乐金元发现水下有个麻包口被冲开了，石头也不见了，洞口已露在外面。他赶紧把麻包口扎好，又和另外一个同志抬了一块一百多斤重的大石头去压麻包，一个大浪打过来，把那个同志打倒了，大石头滚下去压着了乐金元的手指。当时乐金元觉得有点疼，但为了赶快把麻包压住，就没有去管它，继续搬石头。在他旁边的一个同志看见了，连忙喊起来：“乐金元，你的手指头压断了！”乐金元举起手来一看，中指前面的一节压断了，但还没有掉下来，露出一圈白骨头，鲜血直流。旁边的同志都吓呆了。这时洞口被浪冲的更大了，水直往里流，乐金元想：就是指头断一节也没关系，很多人指头断了还不是一样干活，志愿军为了保卫祖国，连生命都可以牺牲，我这点小伤算什么。他对同志们说：“不要紧，没关系！”接着又去搬石头压麻包、堵洞口。副队长叶敦福要扶他到医疗站去，乐金元坚持着要把麻包压好后才跟他去。叶敦福感动得眼泪都流出来了；他问乐金元：“疼不疼？”乐金元感到很疼，怕说出来了大家心里难受，他就说：“有点疼！”在医务所进行手术时，乐金元还是想着堤防上的险情，他对同志们说：“我不疼，你们快去抢险吧！少一个指头算什么，只要武汉能保住！”
    乐金元在工棚里休息的三天中，就不断要求干些轻便活，组织上没有批准。其实那两天他的臂膀已经肿得很高了，伤口有时还流血，夜晚疼得连觉都睡不着。乐金元怕同志们知道了要影响工作，就忍着疼不说。七月三十一日，组织上送乐金元进医院，他在医院里想起了过去给地主砍柴受了伤没人管的情形，又想到现在党和同志对自己的关心和爱护，决心要以实际行动来回答党和同志们的关怀。他在医院休息了五六天再也耐不住了，便跑回堤上要求分配他工作。组织上因为他的伤没好，叫他回医院，他坚决不愿意回去，自动参加了巡堤工作。
