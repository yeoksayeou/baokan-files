    The Role of Machine Tractor Stations Has Been Enhanced
    ——Notes from a Visit to Ukraine, Part 3
    By our correspondent Li He
    In early July, when we visited the countryside of Cherkasy Oblast, local agricultural workers were responding to the decisions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU, stepping up the care of crops and preparing for the harvest. This year, Ukraine's spring and summer weather was abnormal: the spring was relatively cold, and the summer encountered unprecedented heat in many years. Therefore, agricultural workers spent more effort than in previous years.
    Cherkasy Oblast was originally an advanced agricultural area in the southeast of Kyiv Oblast. Due to economic development, it was established as an oblast in January this year. The entire oblast covers an area of 21,000 square kilometers, with three oblast-level cities, seven district-level cities, thirty agricultural districts, four urban-type settlements, and seven hundred and twenty village Soviets. In Cherkasy, the newly established oblast center, various constructions are underway. First, the oblast newspaper "Cherkasy Pravda" was published, with a circulation of 60,000 copies.
    In Cherkasy, we first went to the Machine Tractor Station to understand how the resolution of the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU last year was implemented here.
    Machine Tractor Stations are the decisive force in the development of agriculture, but before September of last year, Machine Tractor Stations were limited to completing tasks such as cultivation, sowing, and harvesting on the fields of collective farms according to contracts signed with the collective farms. Now, Machine Tractor Stations are to take full responsibility for the overall leadership of agriculture, ensuring to increase the output of agricultural and livestock products of the collective farms they serve. Previously, we only heard that Machine Tractor Stations did so much work for collective farms with machines, and the collective farms produced so much. Now, it is put this way: Machine Tractor Stations and the collective farms they serve work together to harvest so much agricultural and livestock products on such a large land area. This shows that Machine Tractor Stations cannot be simple agricultural machinery rental offices; they must play the role of pillars of the state in the countryside leading agriculture. We saw this change very clearly at the Cherkasy Machine Tractor Station.
    As with all Machine Tractor Stations, a district committee secretary and a group of instructors led by him are stationed at this Machine Tractor Station, and the former deputy station director responsible for political work has been abolished. Previously, collective farms were led in production and organization by the agricultural science department of the district soviet, but now they are uniformly led by the Machine Tractor Station, and the district soviet has abolished the agricultural science department. Previously, agronomists and livestock technicians who belonged to the collective farms (some did not have them) are now cadres of the Machine Tractor Station, working in the collective farms, and technically and organizationally obeying the leadership of the chief agronomist and chief livestock technician of the Machine Tractor Station, consulting with the chairman of the collective farm when necessary. Previously, tractor drivers were only seasonal workers of the Machine Tractor Station, and traction engine drivers were members of the collective farm, but now tractor drivers have become regular workers of the station. All this, as well as the addition of agricultural machinery, has greatly developed the work of the Cherkasy Tractor Station.
    The Cherkasy Machine Tractor Station has expanded its staffing since September of last year, doubling the number of specialized technical personnel and supplementing many new machines. It now has eighteen tractor teams, using one hundred tractors, twenty-four combine harvesters, nineteen threshing machines, and a complete set of traction engines, serving fifteen collective farms. It is noteworthy that the agricultural machinery parking house, staff quarters, repair shop, and radio dispatch station are all newly built. At the radio dispatch station, the station director of the Machine Tractor Station picked up the telephone and talked to the captain of the tractor team in the distance, asking about the situation of the trial harvesting of barley. Station directors and other responsible cadres of the Machine Tractor Station have cars, and each tractor team captain has a motorcycle, but the fastest means of communication is still this dispatch station. The work of each tractor team scattered in dozens of kilometers, the requirements for machine repair and petroleum supply, etc., are reported to the station headquarters through the dispatch station at a certain time every day, and are resolved in a timely manner. In the repair shop, there are twelve various lathes and a diesel engine inspection room, with complete equipment, which can repair any problems of agricultural machinery. The repair shop uses 50 to 75 people when there is not much work, and increases to 120 when the work increases.
    We met Yakov Yakovlevich Gikvol. He was originally the chief agronomist of the district agricultural science department, and now he is the chief agronomist of the Machine Tractor Station, leading twenty-two agronomists working in various collective farms. According to him, the resolution of the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU has enabled the Machine Tractor Station to go deeper into agricultural production. In the same way that contracts are signed, those crops that need to use machines and advanced technology were previously mainly based on the collective farm's request. Now the Machine Tractor Station can learn about the situation from the agronomists who work in the collective farm and proactively give assistance to the collective farm. The chief agronomist of the Machine Tractor Station is now the state inspector, and he supervises the quality of the work stipulated in the contract. He is led by the director of the oblast agricultural bureau in agricultural technical issues, not by the station director. Previously, not every collective farm had an agronomist. Agronomists only gave instructions and opinions technically. Now, every collective farm has one or even two agronomists. Agronomists not only guide production technically, but also organize production. For example, if he sees that the forage crops are not growing well, he tries to mobilize people to cut weeds to make up for it.
    Tractor drivers are the central figures in the work of Machine Tractor Stations, but they were previously seasonal workers, collective farm members who were not part of the Tractor Station's establishment. They did not have fixed work in winter. Now they, like the tractor team captain, deputy captain, and combine harvester driver, are regular workers of the Tractor Station. Collective farm members who drive traction engines become seasonal workers and are under the command of the Tractor Station during a certain season. The labor remuneration of tractor drivers has been increased, not only according to the quantity and quality of labor, but also according to the results of the work—the amount of harvest. In addition to the fixed labor remuneration, the higher the harvest, the more reward remuneration the tractor driver receives. The collective farm pays the state purchasing station in kind for the work of the tractor station, and it also increases or decreases with the level of harvest, but does not exceed a certain quota, because the increase in harvest is due to the efforts of the collective farm in addition to the tractor station. In this way, the tractor station and its staff not only care about how much work they do, but also strive to increase the production of the entire collective farm. Station director Stepan Mikhailovich Grishchenko said: The sense of responsibility, discipline, and labor productivity of the mechanical staff of the tractor station have been significantly improved.
    We arrived at a field rest station of a tractor team. Inside a newly painted house are a rest room, club room, etc. Next to it is a row of carriages, which used to be inhabited, but are now used to store machine parts. It was noon break time, and the tractor drivers were still working tirelessly under the scorching sun. Captain Mitrofanov said: This tractor team has exceeded the work in all aspects of cultivation, sowing, and crop care. The tractor drivers who went to the countryside after September last year are working very well. In March this year, after receiving the call from the Party Central Committee to increase grain production, the entire team launched a competition. The team members all know that doing a good job is beneficial to the country and to themselves. What the whole team is thinking about is how to work in a timely, quick, and meticulous manner to ensure increased production. This captain received 1,200 workdays last year, with an income of 12,000 rubles and 3,600 kilograms of grain, which is much higher than in previous years.
    The role of Machine Tractor Stations has been enhanced. It powerfully guarantees the further development of Soviet agriculture.

    机器拖拉机站的作用提高了
    ——乌克兰访问记之三
    本报记者  李何
    七月初旬，我们访问切尔卡斯州的农村的时候，当地农业劳动者正在响应苏共中央六月全会的决定，加紧照料农作物和准备收割。今年乌克兰春夏气候都反常：春季比较寒冷，夏季又遇到多年未见过的炎热。所以农业劳动者比往年花费了更多气力。
    切尔卡斯州原来是基辅州东南的先进农业地区，因为经济的发展，在今年一月成立为州。全州面积二万一千平方公里，有州辖市三个，区辖市七个，农业的区三十个，市型的镇四个，村苏维埃七百二十个。在新成为州中心的切尔卡斯，进行着各种建设，首先是出版了州报“切尔卡斯真理报”，销数已达六万份。
    在切尔卡斯，我们先到机器拖拉机站，了解苏共中央去年九月全会决议在这里是怎样实现了的。
    机器拖拉机站是发展农业的决定性力量，但是在去年九月以前，机器拖拉机站只限于按照和集体农庄签订的合同，在集体农庄田地上完成耕作、播种、收割等工作。现在机器拖拉机站却要负起对农业的全盘领导责任，要保证提高它所服务的各集体农庄的农产品和畜产品的产量。以前只听说：机器拖拉机站用机器为集体农庄做了多少工作，集体农庄产量多少。现在却这样提：机器拖拉机站和它所服务的集体农庄共同努力，在多大的土地面积上收获了多少农产品和畜产品。这说明，机器拖拉机站不能是简单的农业机器出租处，它更要起着国家在农村中领导农业的支柱的作用。这个变化，我们在切尔卡斯机器拖拉机站看得很清楚。
    和在所有机器拖拉机站一样，在这个机器拖拉机站驻着一个区委书记和他所领导的区委会指导员组，取消了以前负责政治工作的副站长。以前集体农庄在生产和组织上受区苏维埃的农业科领导，现在统一由机器拖拉机站领导，区苏维埃取消了农业科。以前集体农庄所有（有些没有）农艺师和饲畜技师，现在都是机器拖拉机站的干部，在集体农庄工作，在技术和组织上听从机器拖拉机站总农艺师和总饲畜师的领导，遇事与集体农庄主席商量。以前拖拉机手只是机器拖拉机站的季节性工人，他和牵引机手都是集体农庄庄员，现在拖拉机手成为站的经常工人。这一切以及农业机器的添加，使切尔卡斯拖拉机站的工作大大发展了。
    切尔卡斯机器拖拉机站从去年九月以来扩大了编制，专门技术人员增加了一倍，补充了许多新式机器。它现有十八个拖拉机队，使用着一百台拖拉机、二十四台联合收割机、十九台打谷机和整套牵引机，为十五个集体农庄服务。令人注目的是：农业机器停放房、工作人员住舍、修理厂和无线电调度台，都是新盖的。在无线电调度台，机器拖拉机站站长拿起电话筒和远处的拖拉机队队长通话，询问试割大麦的情形。机器拖拉机站的站长等负责干部有小汽车，各拖拉机队队长有机器脚踏车，但是最迅速的联络工具还是这调度台。分散在几十公里地方的各拖拉机队的工作情况，机器修理和石油供应等等要求，每天都在一定时候经过调度台汇报站部，而得到及时解决。在修理厂，有十二台各式车床，有柴油机检查室，设备很周全，能够修理农业机器的任何毛病。修理厂在工作不多的时候使用五十到七十五个人手，在工作增多的时候增加到一百二十个。
    我们见了雅科夫·雅科甫列维奇·吉克沃尔。他原来是区农业科的主任农艺师，现在是机器拖拉机站的总农艺师，领导着在各集体农庄工作的二十二个农艺师。据他说：苏共中央九月全会的决议，使机器拖拉机站更深入到农业生产中去。同样是订合同，但是那些农作需要用机器和先进技术，以前主要凭集体农庄方面提出要求，现在机器拖拉机站方面可以从自己在集体农庄工作的农艺师那里了解情况，主动地给予集体农庄帮助。机器拖拉机站的总农艺师现在是国家的监察员，他监督实现合同所规定的工作质量。他在农业技术问题上不受站长而受州农业局局长的领导。以前不是每个集体农庄都有农艺师，农艺师只在技术上发指示，提意见；现在每一个集体农庄有一个甚至两个农艺师，农艺师不仅在技术上指导生产，而且是生产的组织者，例如他看到饲料作物长得不好，就设法动员人去割野草来补足。
    拖拉机手是机器拖拉机站工作中的中心人物，但以前是季节性工人，不属于拖拉机站编制的集体农庄庄员，冬天没有一定工作，现在他们和拖拉机队队长、副队长、联合收割机手一样，都是拖拉机站的经常工人，农闲时做修理机器、饲畜机械化或者拖拉机站的其他工作。驾驶牵引机的集体农庄庄员成为季节性工人，在一定季节内归拖拉机站指挥。拖拉机手的劳动报酬提高了，不但按劳动的数量和质量，还按工作的成果——收获量来决定。除了定额的劳动报酬以外，收获量愈高，拖拉机手所得的奖励报酬也愈多。集体农庄为拖拉机站的工作付给国家采购站的实物报酬，也随着收获量的高低而增减，但不超过一定的定额，因为收获量的提高除了拖拉机站以外，还有集体农庄的努力。这样，拖拉机站和它的工作人员不但关心自己做多少工作，而且努力提高整个集体农庄的生产。站长斯捷潘·米海依洛维奇·格里先科说：拖拉机站的机械人员的责任心、纪律性和劳动生产率显著地提高了。
    我们到了一个拖拉机队的田间休息站。一座油漆未干的新房子内分休息室、俱乐室等等。旁边一列车厢，原来住人的，现在用来装机器零件了。是中午休息的时候了，拖拉机手们还在炎日下不倦地工作着。队长米特罗法诺夫说：这个拖拉机队不论在耕地、播种和照料作物各方面都超额完成了工作。去年九月以后下乡的拖拉机手们工作得很好。今年三月接到党中央提高谷物生产的号召，全队展开了竞赛。队员们都知道，工作好，对国家对自己都有好处。全队所想的，是怎样及时、快当、精细地工作，以保证产量的提高。这位队长去年得到了
  一千二百个劳动日，收入了一万二千卢布和三千六百公斤粮食。比往年提高了很多。
    机器拖拉机站的作用提高了。它有力地保证着苏联农业的进一步发展。
