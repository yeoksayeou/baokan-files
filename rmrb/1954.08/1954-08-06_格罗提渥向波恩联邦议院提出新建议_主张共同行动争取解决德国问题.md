    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th – Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, delivered a statement at the plenary session of the People's Chamber on the 4th, "On the Significance of the Geneva Conference and the Soviet Government's Note of July 24 Regarding European Collective Security and the German Question."

    The statement first pointed out that the Geneva Conference proved that the resolution of international issues is possible, as long as the participating parties possess the good will to promote a policy of peace and understanding.

    The statement then pointed out that the international prestige of the People's Republic of China has grown by leaps and bounds. Today, there is no international issue that can be resolved without China's participation.

    The statement said: If it is possible to ease international tensions in Asia through consultation, then it is also possible to resolve European issues through consultation.

    The statement said: The results of the Geneva Conference and the Soviet note of July 24, 1954, brought new hope and encouragement to the German people, who are engaged in the just struggle to restore Germany's national unity. The German people know that their vital issues cannot be decided by wars of slaughter and civil wars, but can only be resolved and must be resolved through consultation, and should be resolved quickly.

    The statement said: The German people also know that the resolution of the vital issues of the German people not only requires the participation of the Four Powers, but they must participate in the resolution themselves, and help remove the difficulties existing in the understanding of the Four Powers through mutual understanding between Germans. These difficulties are the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community Treaty." These two treaties are incompatible with the restoration of German unity and the attainment of sovereignty by West Germany.

    The statement pointed out that if the representatives of both sides of Korea and Vietnam could meet together in Geneva after and during a bloody war, then the Germans of the eastern and western parts should also be able to meet together in order to reach an understanding before a bloody civil war begins.

    The statement then pointed out that there are currently two development trends in Germany, on the one hand, the democratic development in the German Democratic Republic, and on the other hand, the policies of oppression, threats, and preparation for new wars by the Bonn politicians. This policy has aroused the growing distrust and unease of the people of European countries. The policy of dividing Germany and dragging an armed West Germany into aggressive military pacts makes Germany a hotbed of unrest in Europe and a threat to the peace and security of all peoples. The German people demand peace and security, Germany must not and does not want to be destroyed, therefore, Germany does not want aggressive military alliances or war treaties but a peace treaty.

    The statement reiterated that the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union at the Berlin Conference for restoring German unity on the basis of peace and democracy; concluding a peace treaty; and withdrawing the occupying forces within six months are realistic steps on the road to resolving the German question. The statement expressed its heartfelt welcome to the Soviet government's proposal to convene a conference to establish a European collective security system, believing that this will open the way for the restoration of German unity, and make it possible for the withdrawal of occupying forces and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in the near future. The collective security system will prevent the revival of a hotbed of war in the heart of Europe by neutralizing Germany, and will eliminate the possibility of new wars and civil wars in Germany in Europe.

    The statement finally put forward two suggestions to the Bonn Federal Parliament: (1) Jointly issue an appeal to the Four Powers, requesting them to resume the interrupted negotiations on the German question, and the representatives of the two parts of Germany should participate with equal rights. Before this conference is concluded, the two parts of Germany shall not take any steps to join any military alliance whatsoever. (2) Request an urgent appeal to be made to the government of the Federal Republic, requesting it to appoint plenipotentiary representatives to hold negotiations with the representatives of the German Democratic Republic to determine the position of a common Germany, in order to resolve the vital issues of Germany within the scope of European security.

    格罗提渥向波恩联邦议院提出新建议
    主张共同行动争取解决德国问题
   【新华社柏林五日电】德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥四日在人民议院全体会议上发表了“关于日内瓦会议及苏联政府七月二十四日关于欧洲集体安全和德国问题的照会的意义”的声明。
    声明首先指出，日内瓦会议证明：国际问题的解决是可能的，只要参加的各方怀有推行和平政策和谅解的善良意愿。
    声明接着指出，中华人民共和国的国际威信已经飞跃地增长。在今天，已经没有任何国际问题可以不要中国参加而解决了。
    声明说：如果说，在亚洲可以通过协商使国际紧张局势缓和的话，那么，通过协商来解决欧洲问题也是可能的。
    声明说：日内瓦会议的成果以及一九五四年七月二十四日苏联的照会给正在进行争取恢复德国国家统一的正义斗争的德国人民带来了新的希望和鼓舞。德国人民知道，他们的切身问题不能通过屠杀的战争和内战来决定，而只有通过协商才能够解决和必须通过协商加以解决，而且应该很快地解决。
    声明说：德国人民也知道，德国人民切身问题的解决不仅仅需要通过四大国，他们必须自己参加解决，并且通过德国人彼此的谅解来协助扫除四大国谅解中所存在的困难。这些困难就是“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团条约”。这两个条约是和德国统一的恢复以及和西德主权的获得不相容的。
    声明指出，如果在日内瓦，朝鲜和越南的双方代表能够在流血的战争后和战争中聚会在一起，那么，东西两部分的德国人也应该能够聚会在一起，以便在一个流血的内战还未开始以前达成谅解。
    声明接着指出，目前在德国有两种发展趋势，一方面是在德意志民主共和国的民主发展，另一方面是波恩政客们的压迫、威胁和准备新战争的政策。这一政策引起了欧洲各国人民日益增长的不信任和不安。分裂德国和把一个武装起来的西德拉进侵略性的军事公约的政策使德国成为欧洲不安的策源地和对各国人民的和平和安全的威胁。德国人民要求和平和安全，德国决不能也决不愿毁灭，因此，德国决不要侵略性的军事同盟或战争条约而要和平条约。
    声明再度指出，柏林会议上苏联所提出的在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国统一；缔结和约；六个月内撤退占领军等建议是解决德国问题的道路上的现实步骤。声明表示衷心欢迎苏联政府关于召开建立欧洲集体安全制度的会议的建议，认为这将为恢复德国统一开辟道路，并使撤退占领军和缔结对德和约在不久的将来成为可能。集体安全制度将通过使德国中立化而阻止在欧洲心脏地带复活战争策源地，并将在欧洲排除新战争和德国的内战的可能性。
    声明最后向波恩联邦议院提出两点建议：（一）共同向四大国发出呼吁书，要求重新进行已中断的德国问题的谈判，并应由德国两部分的代表以平等权利参加。在这个会议未结束之前，德国两部分不采取任何步骤加入无论何种军事联盟。（二）要求向联邦共和国政府提出紧急呼吁，请它指派全权代表与德意志民主共和国代表举行谈判以决定一个共同的德国的立场，以便在欧洲安全的范围内解决德国的切身问题。
