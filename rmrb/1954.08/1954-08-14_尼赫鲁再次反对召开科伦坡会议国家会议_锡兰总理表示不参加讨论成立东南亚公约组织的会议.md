Xinhua News Agency, 13th. According to a Reuters dispatch from New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in response to Ceylon Prime Minister Kotelawala on the 12th, once again expressed his opposition to holding a conference of Colombo Conference nations to discuss the issue of the planned Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Kotelawala had originally suggested holding such a conference in Rangoon. After Nehru expressed his opposition to this suggestion, Kotelawala sent another letter to Nehru on the 10th, suggesting holding such a conference in New Delhi.

According to Reuters, Nehru reiterated his position in his reply to Kotelawala on the 12th, believing that holding a conference of Colombo Conference nations was unnecessary at this time. In his previous reply to Kotelawala's suggestion, Nehru considered that now was not an appropriate time to convene a conference of Colombo Conference nations, especially since the majority of these five nations had already expressed their opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th. According to a Reuters dispatch from Colombo: Ministerial figures say that the Ceylonese cabinet agreed on the 12th with Prime Minister Kotelawala’s opinion: Ceylon should not participate in the conference suggested by Western nations to discuss the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 12th. Nepal's Foreign Minister, Dilli Raman Regmi, reiterated his opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in a speech to the Nepalese Consultative Assembly in Kathmandu on August 9th. He said: "This kind of defense organization will endanger the achievements of the peace cause in Indochina. The Nepalese government will never be involved with war or defense organizations. It will pursue a policy of neutrality and support the cause of peace."

Regmi went on to point out that India, Burma, and Indonesia have expressed their opposition to this alliance. He also said that Nepal occupies a strategic position on the border between India and China, therefore he wished to clearly state Nepal's opinion on this issue.

Regmi, referring to the resolution unanimously passed by the Consultative Assembly regarding support for the struggle of the people of Goa to liberate Portuguese territories in India from colonial enslavement and to merge with India, said that the policy of the Nepalese government is to sympathize with the struggle of all colonial peoples against foreign rule. In today's world, colonialism is unacceptable.

According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from New Delhi: Indian newspapers have severely criticized the recent frequent activities of the United States to establish the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The "National Herald" said in its editorial on the 4th that "The Colombo Conference nations cannot have any relationship with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

The editorial further pointed out that "The purpose of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is less for the stability and security of Southeast Asia, and more for an alliance against China. The purpose that this organization proclaims is defense, but the policies of the United States have already sufficiently revealed its ambitious intentions. In addition to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the use of the Organization of American States in the Guatemalan incident has made the impression vividly clear that the long arm of the United States will aggressively insert itself into the interior of Southeast Asia through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. If more proof is needed, the proof has appeared in the form of the United States invading Chinese waters and repeatedly emphasizing that it not only intends to defend Taiwan, but also to turn Taiwan into a base against China."

The editorial said that what the security and stability of the Southeast Asian region needs most is the application of the Five Principals of the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India and the joint statement of Prime Ministers of China and Burma to other places.

    尼赫鲁再次反对召开科伦坡会议国家会议
    锡兰总理表示不参加讨论成立东南亚公约组织的会议
    【新华社十三日讯】据路透社新德里消息报道，印度总理尼赫鲁在十二日答复锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉，再一次表示反对举行一次科伦坡会议国家的会议来讨论筹组中的东南亚公约组织问题。科特拉瓦拉原先建议在仰光举行这样的会议，在尼赫鲁表示反对这个建议后，科特拉瓦拉在十日又致函尼赫鲁，建议在新德里举行这样的会议。
    据路透社报道，尼赫鲁在十二日给科特拉瓦拉的答复中重申了他的态度，认为现在举行一次科伦坡会议国家的会议是没有必要的。尼赫鲁在上次答复科特拉瓦拉的建议时就认为，现在不是召开科伦坡会议国家的会议的适当时候，特别是因为这五个国家中的大多数国家已经表示了它们反对东南亚公约组织的态度。
    【新华社十三日讯】据路透社科伦坡消息报道：部长级人士说，锡兰内阁十二日同意总理科特拉瓦拉的意见：锡兰不应参加西方国家所建议召开的讨论成立东南亚公约组织的会议。
    【新华社新德里十二日电】尼泊尔外交大臣迪利·拉曼·雷格米八月九日在加德满都向尼泊尔谘询议会发表演说，重申反对东南亚公约组织的主张。他说：“这种防御组织将使印度支那和平事业的成就受到危害。尼泊尔政府决不与战争或防御组织发生关系。它将奉行中立政策，支持和平事业。”
    雷格米接着指出，印度、缅甸和印度尼西亚已表示反对这种联盟。他又说，尼泊尔在印度和中国边界占有战略性的地位，因此他希望明确说明尼泊尔对这个问题的意见。
    雷格米谈到谘询议会一致通过的关于支持果阿人民争取使葡萄牙在印度的属地摆脱殖民奴役和并入印度的斗争的决议，他说，尼泊尔政府的政策是同情所有殖民地人民反对外国统治的斗争的。在今天的世界上，殖民主义是不容许存在的。
    据新华社新德里电：印度报纸严厉抨击美国最近为成立东南亚公约组织而进行的频繁活动。
    “国民先驱报”四日的社论说，“科伦坡会议国家不能同东南亚公约组织发生任何关系”。
    社论进一步指出，“东南亚公约组织的目的与其说是为求东南亚的稳定和安全，不如说是反对中国的联盟。这个组织所标榜的目的是防御，但是美国的政策已经足够明白地暴露了它的野心勃勃的意图。除了北大西洋公约组织以外，在危地马拉事件中利用美洲国家组织的行为已经使这样的印象显得真切：美国的长臂将通过东南亚公约组织气势汹汹地插入东南亚的内部。假如还需要更多的证明的话，证明已经以这样的形式出现了：美国侵入中国海面，并一再着重表明不仅要防守台湾，而且要把台湾变成对抗中国的基地。”
    社论说，东南亚地区的安全和稳定最需要的是把中印两国总理联合声明和中缅两国总理联合声明中的五项原则应用到别的地方去。
