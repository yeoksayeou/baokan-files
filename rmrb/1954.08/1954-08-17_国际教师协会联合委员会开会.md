Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: The 19th meeting of the Joint Committee of International Teachers' Associations was held in Moscow from the 8th to the 11th. Prominent educators from France, Britain, China, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Chile, Indonesia, the German Democratic Republic, and the Soviet Union participated in the meeting. Representatives from the United Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the International Bureau of Education attended the meeting as observers.

    Committee Chairman Gossart, Secretary-General Hombourger, and Deputy Secretary-General Chevalier issued a statement to the press, saying that the 19th meeting of the Joint Committee of International Teachers' Associations, with the unanimous agreement of the three founding organizations representing nearly seven million educators—the International Federation of Secondary School Teachers, the International Federation of Elementary School Teachers, and the International Federation of Teachers' Unions—adopted the Charter of Educators. This charter consists of fifteen articles, which stipulate the rights and obligations of educators, as well as the conditions necessary for improving education, so that education can effectively cultivate young people who can fulfill the task of building a peaceful and happy future. For the first time, educators from around the world have reached an agreement on such a document.

    The statement also said that the Joint Committee unanimously adopted two resolutions on expanding international contacts among teachers and expanding the relationship between the Joint Committee and several international organizations. The statement concluded that the achievements of the Joint Committee in professional planning and protecting education demonstrate that, despite differing political views, people of goodwill can always reach an agreement, because they consider the most important task to be safeguarding the interests and future of young people.
