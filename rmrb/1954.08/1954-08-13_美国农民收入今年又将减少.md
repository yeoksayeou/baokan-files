Xinhua News Agency, New York: Due to the impact of the economic crisis, American farmers' income will decrease again this year.

According to materials from "U.S. News & World Report," American farmers' income will decrease again this year. It is estimated that this year's income will decrease by $2 billion compared to 1953, $3.5 billion compared to 1952, and $4 billion compared to 1951. The magazine pointed out that farmers' incomes have declined, but the cost of living and production is even higher than before, making the farmers' situation increasingly difficult. The magazine expressed concern about this situation, worrying that the resentment of agricultural areas towards the U.S. government will cause the ruling Republican Party to lose more support in this year's elections.

　　美国农民收入今年又将减少
    【新华社讯】纽约消息：由于经济危机的影响，美国农民今年的收入又将减少。
    据“美国新闻与世界报道”的材料，今年美国农民的收入将再度减少。估计今年的收入将比一九五三年减少二十亿美元，比一九五二年减少三十五亿美元，比一九五一年减少四十亿美元。杂志指出，农民的收入下降了，但是生活与生产的支出反而比以前高昂，因而农民的处境已越来越困难。杂志对这种情况表示忧虑，它担忧农业区域对美国政府的怨愤不平，将使执政的共和党在今年选举中失去更多的支持。
