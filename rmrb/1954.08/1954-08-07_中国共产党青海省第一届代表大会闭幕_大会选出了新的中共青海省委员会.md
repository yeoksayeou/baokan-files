    The First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Qinghai Province successfully concluded on July 27th after lasting for ten days. Based on the Party's general line during the transition period, the general tasks concerning ethnic issues, and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, the congress, on the basis of fully promoting democracy and conducting criticism and self-criticism, reviewed and summarized the work of Qinghai region over the past four years, and discussed and determined the future work tasks. The congress elected a new Qinghai Provincial Committee of the CCP composed of Gao Feng and nineteen others.
    A total of 305 delegates attended this congress, including 41 party member representatives from ethnic minorities such as Tibetan, Hui, Mongolian, Tu, Salar, and Kazakh. This is a significantly different feature compared to the previous two Party Congresses, marking the gradual growth of communist-conscious cadres from ethnic minorities.
    The congress listened to the reports made by Gao Feng, Zhou Renshan, and Chen Sigong on behalf of the previous Qinghai Provincial Committee of the CCP, regarding the work of the Qinghai region over the past four years and future tasks, the work of Party building in the Qinghai region, and the work of Party discipline inspection in the Qinghai region over the past four years and future opinions, respectively. The congress discussed and approved these three reports.
    The congress believes that the leadership of the previous Qinghai Provincial Committee of the CCP was correct. Over the past four years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Provincial Committee has led the Party committees at all levels and all comrades in the Qinghai region, based on the actual situation in the Qinghai region, adhered to the principle of prudence and stability, closely united the people of all ethnic groups in the province, and conscientiously implemented the Party's various policies, especially the Party's policy of equality and unity among ethnic groups. As a result, it has achieved great successes in various tasks such as stabilizing social order, strengthening ethnic unity, promoting ethnic regional autonomy, and restoring and developing production, and has initially improved and raised the economic and cultural lives of the people of all ethnic groups. Over the past four years, industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production in the province has seen significant development, and the socialist components of the economy have grown. As of the end of 1953, a total of 3,471 ethnic minority cadres were trained and promoted in various tasks (accounting for more than 17% of the total number of cadres in the province), and 732 ethnic minority party members were recruited (93 of whom served as members of the Party's county committees, ministers, and district party secretaries, some of whom have been promoted to deputy secretaries of county committees). In areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, as of the end of June this year, eleven ethnic regional autonomous governments equivalent to special districts and county levels have been established successively, and leaders of all ethnic groups who have contact with the people have participated in the work of the people's government. All of these have created favorable conditions for gradually realizing the Party's general line during the transition period and the general tasks concerning ethnic issues in the province in the future.
    The congress pointed out that Qinghai is a multi-ethnic region, and in carrying out the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, it is necessary to fully consider and take care of the development characteristics of all ethnic minorities, and continue to implement the principle of prudence and stability; in work, it is necessary to further strengthen and consolidate the unity of all ethnic groups, continue to give play to the role of the ethnic democratic united front, and unite all those who can be united to do a good job together. In the future, the main task in agricultural areas should be to develop the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, and correspondingly do a good job in various economic and political tasks; in pastoral areas, the central task should be to continue to give play to the effectiveness of ethnic regional autonomy, train ethnic minority cadres, and do a good job in economic work focusing on the development of animal husbandry. The congress also made specific plans for training ethnic minority cadres and developing ethnic minority party members in the next three years, and adopted the "Resolution on Training Ethnic Minority Cadres."
    Based on the spirit of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, the congress reviewed and discussed the issue of Party unity in the Qinghai region, and adopted the resolution "On Continuing to Implement the 'Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity' of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party."

    中国共产党青海省第一届代表大会闭幕
    大会选出了新的中共青海省委员会
    中国共产党青海省第一届代表大会历时十天，已在七月二十七日胜利闭幕。大会根据党在过渡时期的总路线和在民族问题方面的总任务以及党的七届四中全会的精神，在充分发扬民主、开展批评和自我批评的基础上，检查和总结了青海地区四年多来的工作，讨论并确定了今后的工作任务。大会选出高峰等十九人组成新的中共青海省委员会。
    出席这次大会的代表共三百零五人，其中有藏、回、蒙、土、撒拉、哈萨克等少数民族的党员代表四十一人。这是和从前两次党代表会议显著不同的特点，它标志着少数民族具有共产主义觉悟干部正在逐渐成长。
    大会听取了高峰、周仁山和陈思恭三人分别代表前届中共青海省委员会所作的关于青海地区四年多来的工作和今后任务、关于青海地区党的建设工作、关于青海地区四年多来党的纪律检查工作及今后意见等报告，大会讨论和批准了这三个报告。
    大会认为：前届中共青海省委员会的领导是正确的。四年多来，省委在党中央、毛主席的正确领导下，领导着青海地区各级党委和全体同志，根据青海地区的实际情况，坚持慎重稳进的方针，紧密团结了全省各族人民，认真贯彻和执行了党的各项政策，特别是党的民族平等团结政策，因而在安定社会秩序、加强民族团结、推行民族区域自治、恢复和发展生产等各项工作中，都获得了巨大的成就，初步改善和提高了各族人民的经济和文化生活。四年多来，全省工、农、牧业生产有了显著的发展，社会主义成分的经济日益增长。截至一九五三年年底，在各项工作中共培养和提拔了脱离生产的少数民族干部三千四百七十一名（占全省干部总数的百分之十七多），吸收了少数民族党员七百三十二名（其中有九十三人担任了党的县委委员、部长及区委书记等职务，部分已被提为县委副书记）。在少数民族聚居的地区，截至今年六月底，先后建立了十一个相当于专区和县级的各民族区域自治政权，各民族中与人民群众有联系的领袖人物参加了人民政府的工作。所有这些，都为今后在全省逐步实现党在过渡时期的总路线和在民族问题方面的总任务创造了有利条件。
    大会指出：青海是多民族地区，在进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业中，必须充分考虑和照顾各少数民族的发展特点，继续贯彻慎重稳进的方针；在工作中要进一步加强和巩固各民族的团结，继续发挥民族民主统一战线的作用，团结一切可能团结的人共同作好工作。今后，在农业地区应以发展农业生产互助合作运动为主要任务，相应地作好各项经济工作和政治工作；在牧业地区应以继续发挥民族区域自治的效能、培养少数民族干部和作好以发展畜牧业为主的经济工作为中心任务。大会还作出了在今后三年内培养少数民族干部和发展少数民族党员的具体计划，通过了“关于培养少数民族干部”的决议。
    大会根据党的七届四中全会决议的精神，检查和讨论了青海地区党的团结问题，通过了为继续贯彻执行党的七届四中全会“关于增强党的团结的决议”的决议。　（新华社）
