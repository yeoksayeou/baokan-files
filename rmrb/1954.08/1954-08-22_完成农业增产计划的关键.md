    The Key to Completing the Agricultural Production Increase Plan
    Wang Yi
    In vast areas of the country that have not suffered from flooding, increased production plans for grain, cotton, and other agricultural crops have been formulated to compensate for the losses in agricultural production in disaster-stricken areas and to strive to complete the national agricultural production tasks according to plan. The Shanxi Provincial People's Congress resolved to increase grain production by another 200 to 300 million jin and cotton production by 40 million jin on top of the original plan to increase grain production by 500 million jin and cotton production by 130 million jin; Zhejiang Province originally planned to increase grain production by more than 600 million jin, but after discussions at all levels, this has been increased to more than 1.1 billion jin; non-disaster areas in Anhui Province decided to increase grain production by more than 1.4 billion jin; Shandong Province plans to increase grain production by 1 billion jin; the Fujian Provincial Committee called for an average increase in production of about 7 jin per mu on all 20 million mu of autumn crops; other provinces have also formulated similar agricultural production increase plans. These plans are both necessary and timely. The current task is to quickly turn these plans into practical actions by the broad masses of peasants. As long as this work is done well, a new upsurge of patriotic production increase will inevitably be set off in the vast rural areas, laying a reliable foundation for completing this year's agricultural production plan.

    It is entirely possible to increase agricultural production beyond the target. First of all, this year, the area of non-disaster areas across the country is vast, and these areas are mostly blessed with favorable weather and good growth of crops, which provides a reliable basis for increasing production beyond the target. Secondly, the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement has developed significantly since last winter. At present, the number of agricultural production cooperatives has increased from more than 10,000 last year to more than 100,000, and mutual aid teams have also grown significantly. These organized peasants have been, and will continue to be, an important force for increasing production. Thirdly, there is still strong potential in terms of farming methods and land use, which provides a reliable source for increasing production. According to a survey in the Northwest region, the wheat yield of seven agricultural production cooperatives in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, was more than 32% higher than that of the local masses this year; the Jiaojiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gansu increased production by more than 160% in two years; and the yield of many mutual aid teams was also about 10% higher than that of ordinary farmers. According to estimates in Yunnan Province, if field management and weeding can be stepped up, it is possible to achieve the task of increasing production by 10%; if the existing land fertility can be fully utilized, it may be possible to strive for another 10% increase. From this, it can be seen that as long as every production cooperative and mutual aid team is well-managed, and as long as all peasants can be mobilized to tap the potential of agricultural production as much as possible, then the manpower and land resources in the vast non-disaster areas will exert tremendous productivity, and the plan to increase production beyond the target will certainly be realized.

      However, the development of the increased production movement is currently uneven, and the speed and quality vary from region to region. Taking Zhejiang Province as an example, although they started to deploy this work relatively early, according to a recent report from the Zhejiang Provincial Committee, only Hang County, Jinhua, Xindeng and other counties have taken swift action. They have implemented the increased production plan among the masses and mobilized the broad masses of peasants to participate in this movement; many other areas are still at the level of general appeals. Of course, the situation in Zhejiang Province is not unique to that province. Why is there still a slow pace in dealing with such urgent and important work? The most important reason is that many cadres and peasants in non-disaster areas have blindly optimistic, conservative, and complacent ideas. Some believe that production has been increasing every year and has "reached the top"; others believe that a lot of effort has been put in this year, and there has already been a good harvest, so they should "take a break"; some admit that increasing production beyond the target is necessary, but believe that the "overall situation" of agricultural production is already "set and there is nothing that can be done"; even in some areas, after the summer harvest, they are satisfied with their existing achievements and have relaxed their leadership over mutual aid and cooperation organizations, causing the peasants to become disoriented. In Hancheng and Heyang, Shaanxi, 20% to 30% of the mutual aid teams have disbanded, and there is a fairly widespread phenomenon of poor labor organization in agricultural production cooperatives, leading to idleness and absenteeism, and some cooperatives are even in danger of collapsing. The situation in Hancheng and other places should arouse the vigilance of all rural work cadres, and they should quickly overcome various complacent ideas and shortcomings in their work; otherwise, not only will it be impossible to achieve increased production beyond the target, but this year's autumn harvest will also be affected.

    The key to achieving the agricultural production increase plan at present lies in leadership organs at all levels doing a good job in a series of organizational tasks. This means that it is necessary to implement the class line in rural areas and closely rely on rural mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Rural leadership organs at all levels must use their main strength to lead the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, and must vigorously consolidate and develop the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. Because a series of problems that need to be solved in order to increase production beyond the target, such as the improvement of labor organization, the mobilization of semi-labor force, the adjustment of seeds and farm tools, and the reform of agricultural technology, can only be better solved in mutual aid and cooperation organizations (especially agricultural production cooperatives), and at the same time, only under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, can we help individual farmers overcome difficulties and mobilize all farmers to participate in the struggle to increase production beyond the target. Some rural work cadres have opposed the increased production beyond the target and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, believing that only one of the two tasks can be grasped at a time, and that it is impossible to have both, which is completely wrong. Shuanglin Township, Hang County, Zhejiang Province, took the Jiang Hongyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative as the center, carefully calculated accounts, tapped potential, and broke the conservative idea that "production has been finalized," calculating that each member of the cooperative could increase their income by an average of 530 jin of grain. At the township's mutual aid and cooperation representatives' meeting, the Jiang Hongyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative introduced their experience, which made many mutual aid team leaders sleepless and held meetings overnight to discuss increased production plans. 160 farmers in the township actively requested to join the agricultural production cooperative. This shows that where a high tide of increased production movement is formed, a high tide of mutual aid and cooperation movement will inevitably occur. These two tasks are inseparable.

    In order to mobilize the broad masses of rural cadres and peasants and quickly turn the plan to increase production beyond the target into practical actions, it is necessary to carry out education in two aspects. On the one hand, we must explain the great political and economic significance of the movement to increase production beyond the target in supporting national construction and supporting compatriots in disaster areas. On the other hand, we must explain that time is currently tight. In areas where it is possible to plant another season of crops, if time is delayed and the season between the end of summer and the beginning of autumn is missed, the seeds cannot be sown; in other areas, now is also a tense time to strengthen field management. If we do not start immediately, the increase in autumn field production cannot be realized. In carrying out this education, Zhejiang Province has already had some good experiences that can be used as a reference for other places. For example, the peasants of Qu County recalled the fact that they ate Guangdong rice after suffering from disasters last year, which enhanced their sympathy for supporting compatriots in disaster areas; the peasants of Daqing Township, Fuyang recalled the suffering of natural and man-made disasters during the Kuomintang era, which enhanced their enthusiasm for increasing grain production to support national construction; Hang County adopted the method of calculating four accounts: potential digging account, supporting national industrialization account, increasing income account, and supporting disaster area farmers account, which also achieved good results. From these facts, it can be seen that as long as we recognize the great significance of increasing production beyond the target and adopt good mobilization methods, the broad masses of peasants will definitely take active action and create new achievements in increasing production.

    The people of cities and industrial and mining areas, industrial and commercial departments, and transportation organs must vigorously support the movement to increase production beyond the target by the broad masses of peasants. Farm implement and pesticide factories should actively meet the needs of peasants for means of production, commercial departments and cooperatives at all levels should better adjust and supply peasants with grain and other commodities, transportation departments should vigorously serve the movement to increase production beyond the target by peasants, and residents of cities and industrial and mining areas should conserve the use of daily industrial products to supply the needs of our peasant brothers. As long as the people of the whole country unite as one, support each other, we will certainly be able to ensure the realization of the plan to increase production beyond the target, further strengthen the consolidated alliance between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants, and overcome difficulties and achieve victory in agricultural production.

    Peasants across the country, take action quickly and strive to complete the plan to increase production beyond the target!

    完成农业增产计划的关键
    王揖
    全国广大没有遭受水涝灾害的地区，已纷纷订出超额增加粮棉和其它农作物的生产计划，以弥补受灾地区农业生产的损失，争取按计划完成全国农业生产任务。山西省人民代表大会决议要在原计划增产五亿斤粮食和一亿三千万斤籽棉的基础上，再增产二至三亿斤粮食和四千万斤籽棉；浙江省原计划增产六亿多斤粮食，经过层层讨论，已增至十一亿斤以上；安徽省非灾区决定增产粮食十四亿多斤；山东省计划超额增产粮食十亿斤；福建省委号召在全部二千万亩秋季作物的土地上，每亩平均增产七斤左右；其他各省也制订了类似的农业增产计划。这些计划都是十分必要而又切合时宜的。目前的任务，就是要迅速地把这些计划变成广大农民的实际行动。只要作好这项工作，就必然会在广大农村中掀起一个爱国增产的新高潮，为完成今年农业生产计划奠定可靠的基础。
    超额增加农业生产是完全可能的。首先是因为今年全国非灾地区面积广大，这些地区多是风调雨顺，农作物生长良好，这就为超额增产提供了可靠的基础。其次是农村互助合作运动去冬以来有显著的发展，目前农业生产合作社已由去年的一万多个增加到十万个以上，互助组也有了很大的发展，这些组织起来的农民，在过去和今后，都是提高生产的重要力量。再次就是在耕作方法和土地使用方面，目前都还存在着雄厚的潜力，这又为增加生产提供了可靠的源泉。根据西北地区的调查，陕西省大荔县七个农业生产合作社，今年小麦产量高出当地群众百分之三十二以上；甘肃焦家庄农业生产合作社，两年增加生产百分之一百六十多；许多互助组的产量，也比一般农户高出百分之十左右。又据云南省的估计，目前如能加紧中耕锄草，完成增产
  一成的任务是可以实现的；如能充分利用现有地力，还可能争取再增产一成。由此可见，只要把每一个生产合作社和互助组都办好，只要能发动全体农民尽量挖掘农业生产潜力，那末，以广大非灾地区的人力和地力，就将会发挥出巨大的生产力，超额增产计划就一定能够实现。
      但是，超额增产运动目前发展得是不平衡的，各地区快慢好坏是不一致的。以浙江省为例，虽然他们布置这项工作比较早，但是根据浙江省委最近的报告，目前只有杭县、金华、新登等县行动迅速，他们已把超额增产计划贯彻到群众中去，发动了广大农民参加这一运动；其它许多地区，则仍停留在一般号召上。当然，像浙江省的情况，其它省区也不会是没有的。对待这样紧迫而重要的工作，为什么还会有步履迟缓的现象呢？最主要的就是在不少非灾区的干部和农民中，存在着盲目乐观的保守自满思想，有的认为年年增产，“生产到顶”了；有的认为今年费劲很多，又已丰收，应该“歇一歇”了；有的虽然承认超额增产是必要的，但又认为目前农业生产的“大局已定，无能为力”；甚至有的地区在夏收之后，满足于已有的成就，放松了对互助合作组织的领导，使农民产生了涣散情绪。陕西韩城、郃阳等地互助组有百分之二十至三十散伙了，农业生产合作社也相当普遍地存在着劳动力组织不善以致窝工旷工的现象，个别社还有垮台的危险。韩城等地的情况，应该引起所有农村工作干部的警惕，迅速克服各种自满思想和工作中的缺点，否则，不仅超额增产无法实现，就是今年秋收也将受到影响。
    目前实现农业增产计划的关键在于各级领导机关，做好一系列的组织工作。这就是必须贯彻执行农村的阶级路线，紧密地依靠农村的互助合作组织。各级农村领导机关，必须以主要力量用来领导以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，必须大力巩固和发展农村的互助合作运动。因为超额增产所需要解决的一系列问题，例如劳动组织的改善、半劳动力的发动、种籽和农具的调剂、农业技术的改革等等，都只有在互助合作组织（特别是农业生产合作社）中才能得到较好的解决，同时也只有在互助合作组织的带动下，才能帮助单干农民克服困难，发动全体农民参加超额增产的斗争。有一部分农村工作干部，把超额增产和互助合作运动对立起来，认为两项工作只能抓紧一件，不可兼得，这是完全错误的。浙江省杭县双林乡，以江洪元农业生产合作社为中心，算细账，挖潜力，打破了认为“生产已成定局”的保守思想，平均每户社员计算可以超额增加收入五百三十斤粮食。在乡的互助合作代表会议上，江洪元农业生产合作社介绍了他们的经验，使得许多互助组长睡不着觉，连夜开会讨论增产计划，全乡有一百六十户农民积极要求参加农业生产合作社。这就说明那里的超额增产运动形成高潮，那里也就必然产生互助合作运动的高潮。这两项工作是不可分离的。
    为了把广大农村干部和农民动员起来，迅速地把超额增产计划变成实际行动，必须进行两方面的教育，一方面说明超额增产运动对支援国家建设、支援灾区同胞的重大政治意义与经济意义。一方面说明目前时间紧迫，在能增播一季作物的地区，如果拖延时间，错过了处暑白露之间的季节，就播不下种子了；在其它地区，目前也正是加强田间管理的紧张时机，如不即时动手，秋田增产也无法实现。在进行这项教育中，浙江省已出现了一些较好的经验，可供各地参考。例如衢县农民回忆了去年本地受灾后吃广东大米的事实，提高了支援灾区同胞的同情心；富阳大青乡农民回忆了国民党时天灾人祸的苦难，提高了增产粮食支援国家建设的积极性；杭县采取算四笔账：挖潜力账、支援国家工业化账、增加收入账、支援灾区农民账，也收到很好效果。从这些事实中可以看到，只要我们认识了超额增产的重大意义，又采取了良好的动员方法，广大农民就一定会积极行动起来，在增产中创造出新的成就。
    城市和工矿区人民，工业和商业部门，以及交通运输机关，都必须大力支持广大农民的超额增产运动。农具农药工厂，应该积极满足农民对生产资料的需要，各级商业部门和合作社，应该更好的调剂和供应农民的粮食及其它商品，交通运输部门，应该大力为农民的超额增产运动服务，城市和工矿区居民，应该节约使用日用工业产品，用以供应农民兄弟的需要。只要全国人民团结一致，互相支援，我们就一定能保证超额增产计划的实现，就一定能进一步加强城乡之间、工农之间的巩固联盟，也就一定能战胜困难，取得农业增产的胜利。
    全国农民们，迅速行动起来，为完成超额增产计划而奋斗！
