Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 24th: The autumn grain crops on over 70 million mu in Northwest China are generally growing well. Rice in southern Shaanxi is heading, and individual areas such as Xixiang County have already begun harvesting, with an estimated average yield of 580 jin per mu. In the Guanzhong area and southern Shaanxi, early corn has mostly formed cobs, late corn is heading, millet is over a foot tall, and late millet seedlings have emerged completely. In Shaanxi Province, millet, corn, and sorghum have generally been weeded two to three times, corn has been earthed up, and some areas have organized farmers to carry out artificial detasseling and pollination; topdressing of autumn fields has increased compared to last year. In the Tianshui, Pingliang, and Qingyang areas of Gansu, corn and sorghum are mostly three feet tall, and have generally been weeded twice, with some weeded three or four times. In Jingchuan, Lingtai, and other counties where planting was earlier, corn and sorghum are already five to six feet tall. In colder areas such as Tongwei, Longxi, and Zhangxian, the first weeding of autumn fields has also been completed. In Ningxia Province, over 600,000 mu of rice and over 1.1 million mu of millet and sorghum are growing well, with rice stalks about 1.5 feet tall, weeded two or three times. In Qinghai Province, seedlings of various autumn field crops have emerged completely, the soil moisture is good, and spring-sown potatoes in irrigated areas and some mountain areas have already blossomed. In most areas of Xinjiang, attention has been paid to planting autumn field crops, and cultivation techniques have improved compared to last year. For example, in Korla County, corn and rice have generally been weeded twice this year and fertilized with manure or oil residue. In Minfeng County, the work of land preparation, planting, and fertilization for corn has been more meticulous than in previous years. Now, early corn is over three feet tall, late corn is about one foot tall, and most have been watered two or three times. In more than ten counties and cities in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai Provinces, there has been an outbreak of armyworm damage, and various localities have mobilized the masses to swat and dig ditches for prevention and control.
    Overall, autumn crops are growing well in various places. If there are no unexpected disasters in the future, it is estimated that the region can overfulfill this year's planned output.
    Cotton is also growing very well. This year, because various localities have generally paid attention to seed treatment, coupled with good weather conditions before and after seedling emergence, and timely rainfall, cotton seedlings are generally not lacking. In the main cotton-producing area of Guanzhong in Shaanxi Province, each mu of cotton retains about 3,000 to 4,000 seedlings, 400 to 500 more than in the past. One-third of the cotton fields have been top-dressed, and weeding has generally been done three to four times. Now, cotton stalks in paddy fields are two feet four or five inches tall, with eleven or twelve fruit branches per plant, six or seven bolls, and more than twenty flower buds. Cotton stalks in dry land are one foot five or six inches tall, with seven or eight fruit branches per plant, five or six bolls, and fifteen or sixteen flower buds. Pruning, side-shoot removal, and pest control are in progress, and a good harvest is very promising. Cotton in the Yan'an area of northern Shaanxi, as well as in Xinjiang and Gansu, is also growing very well.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 24th: The major spring crops on over 100 million mu in Sichuan Province have mostly begun to be harvested. Many areas are reporting good harvests, and increased production is expected. The 51 million mu of rice, except for the western Sichuan Plain, which will only begin harvesting at the end of August, has entered a stage of intensive harvesting. In the Luzhou area, most of the rice has been harvested, and generally, production can increase by 7% compared to last year. In Weiyuan County, over 200,000 mu of rice have been harvested, an increase of about 10% compared to last year, with an increase of over 14 million jin of rice. Corn, sorghum, beans, and other miscellaneous grains have also been mostly harvested. The Jiangjin area has generally reported a 10% increase in corn production, and twelve agricultural production cooperatives in Changshou County have achieved a harvest of corn that is more than 20% higher than last year. Cotton in the Fujiang and Tuojiang River basins is bearing many bolls and has begun to open. The Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jianyang County will exceed the original plan of producing 45 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year.
    During the autumn harvest, various localities are paying special attention to reducing field losses and increasing the actual harvest volume. Farmers are united around mutual aid and cooperation organizations, rationally organizing labor, and carrying out technical innovation movements in threshing. Sixty percent of farmers in Zizhong County are adopting the experience of "transmitting hand millet threshing," which can reduce mold during harvesting. Various localities have also vigorously promoted improved threshing machines. The Nanchong area will promote more than 2,700 threshing machines, which are expected to reduce field losses by seven jin of rice per mu. In the entire area of five million mu of rice, an additional 30 million jin of rice can be threshed.

    西北区七千多万亩庄稼生长良好
    四川省许多地区喜报丰收农民紧张收割
    【新华社西安二十四日电】西北区七千多万亩秋粮作物普遍生长良好。陕南水稻正抽穗，个别地区如西乡等县现已开始收割，估计每亩平均产量可达到五百八十斤。关中地区及陕南地区早玉米多已出棒，晚玉米正抽穗，谷子一尺多高，晚糜子苗已出齐。陕西全省糜子、谷子、玉米一般锄草两次到三次，玉米已经培土，部分地区并组织农民进行了人工去雄授粉；秋田追肥比去年增加。甘肃的天水、平凉、庆阳等专区的玉米、高粱大部三尺来高，普遍锄了两遍草，部分锄了三遍或四遍，泾川、灵台等县播种较早的玉米、高粱已五六尺高，气候较寒的如通渭、陇西、漳县一带的秋田也已锄了头遍草。宁夏全省六十多万亩水稻和一百一十多万亩糜子、谷子都生长很好，稻子高有一尺五寸左右，薅过两三遍草。青海省各种秋田作物苗已出齐，地墒很好，川水地和一部分山地的春播马铃薯已经开花。新疆大部地区对秋田作物播种抓的较紧，耕作技术比去年有所改进，如库尔勒县今年的玉米、水稻普遍锄了两遍，上了粪土或油渣，民丰县玉米的整地、播种、施肥等工作都比往年细致；现在早玉米已三尺多高，晚的一尺来高，大多浇过两、三次水。甘肃、宁夏、青海三省有十多县市发生粘虫为害，各地已发动群众扑打和挖沟防治。
    总的来看，各地秋季作物生长较好，今后如无意外灾害，估计全区可超额完成今年计划产量。
    棉花同样生长很好。由于今年各地普遍重视了种子处理工作，加以幼苗出土前后气候条件较好，雨水适时，棉苗一般不缺。主要棉区的陕西关中地区每亩棉花约留苗三千到四千株，比以往多留四五百株，有三分之一的棉田施了追肥，一般锄草三次到四次；现在水田棉花株高二尺四五寸，每株有果枝十一二个，有桃六七个，花蕾二十多个；旱地棉花株高一尺五六寸，每株有果枝七八个，桃子五六个，花蕾十五六个，正进行整枝、打杈和治虫工作，丰收很有希望。陕北延安专区和新疆、甘肃的棉花也都生长十分好。
    【新华社成都二十四日电】四川省一亿多亩大春作物大部开始收割，许多地区喜报丰收，增产有望。五千一百万亩水稻，除川西平原在八月底才开始收割外，都已进入紧张收割阶段。泸州专区水稻已收割大半，一般可比去年增产百分之七。威远县二十多万亩水稻已收割完毕，约比去年增产一成以上，增产稻谷一千四百多万斤。玉米、高粱、豆类等杂粮也已收割大半，江津专区的玉米已普告增产一成，长寿县十二个农业生产合作社的玉米获得比去年增产二成以上的丰收。涪江、沱江流域的棉花，结桃累累，开始吐絮，早种的已经收花。简阳县高坎农业生产合作社将超额完成今年原订每亩产四十五斤皮棉的计划。
    在秋收中，各地特别注意减少田间抛撒，提高实际收获量。农民们团结在互助合作组织周围，合理组织劳动力，开展打谷技术革新运动。资中县百分之六十的农民都采用“打传手谷子”的经验，这种方法可以减少收割中的霉烂现象。各地并大力推广了改良打谷机，南充专区将推广打谷机二千七百多部，预计每亩田减少田间抛撒七斤稻谷，全专区五百万亩水稻，就可多打三千万斤稻谷。
