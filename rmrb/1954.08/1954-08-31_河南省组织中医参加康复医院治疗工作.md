Henan Province Organizes Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctors to Participate in Treatment Work at Rehabilitation Hospitals

In order to fully utilize the role of traditional Chinese medicine, the Henan Provincial Department of Health has organized traditional Chinese medicine doctors to participate in the treatment work at rehabilitation hospitals.

Starting in November of last year, the Provincial Department of Health mobilized thirteen practicing traditional Chinese medicine doctors from Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and rural areas to participate in the medical work at rehabilitation hospitals in stages. Each period of work lasts for three months, and the third medical team is about to finish its term.

The traditional Chinese medicine doctors participating in the medical team, having studied the general tasks of the state during the transition period, have raised their socialist awareness. In their work, they have all demonstrated the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the injured and sick. After arriving at the hospital, most of them chose diseases of the digestive, circulatory, and urinary systems as their treatment targets. During the treatment process, the attending physicians of the hospital gave them detailed introductions to the patient's condition and past treatment history. During this period, the number of patients treated by traditional Chinese medicine doctors belonging to the digestive system (chronic gastroenteritis) was twenty-two; the number of patients with circulatory system (heart valve insufficiency) diseases was four; and the number of patients with urinary system (chronic nephritis) diseases who had not been cured for a long time was seven, totaling thirty-three. In the treatment process, the traditional Chinese medicine doctors worked conscientiously and responsibly, always patiently and carefully diagnosing patients, identifying the important reasons why patients' past medications had not been effective, and then determining the correct treatment methods based on the condition. Many patients' conditions have shown significant improvement after treatment by traditional Chinese medicine doctors. The effect is particularly significant for diseases of the digestive system (chronic gastroenteritis). For example, patient Gao Zhiyong had suffered from chronic gastroenteritis for more than two years and always vomited after eating, had chest and abdominal pain, often had blood in his stool, and suffered from neurasthenia and spermatorrhea. He had not been cured after a long period of treatment. After careful examination and treatment by a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, Gao Zhiyong's illness was finally cured and he was discharged from the hospital.

Under the leadership of the Party and administration of the rehabilitation hospital, the traditional Chinese medicine medical team has always united and cooperated with the Western medicine doctors in the hospital and has established a good relationship with the injured and sick. The leaders and comrades of the rehabilitation hospital also respected them and expressed their desire to learn from them. Now, the Henan Provincial People's Government Health Department has accepted the request of the rehabilitation hospital and is actively organizing the fourth traditional Chinese medicine medical team to work at the hospital.

    河南省组织中医参加康复医院治疗工作
    为充分发挥中医作用，河南省卫生厅组织中医参加康复医院的治疗工作。
    去年十一月起，省卫生厅即动员了开封、郑州以及乡村中的部分开业中医师十三人，分期参加康复医院的医疗工作。每期工作三个月，现在第三期医疗组即将结束。
    参加医疗组的中医，由于学习了国家过渡时期的总任务，提高了社会主义觉悟，在工作中都表现了全心全意为伤病员服务的精神，他们到院后，大多选择消化系、循环系、泌尿系的病症为治疗对象。在治疗中，该院的主治医师都给他们详细地介绍病情和过去治疗的情况。这一时期中，经中医治疗者属于消化系（慢性肠胃炎）病患者二十二人；循环系（心脏瓣膜闭锁不全）病患者四人；泌尿系
  （慢性肾脏炎）病经久治不愈者七人，共计三十三人。在治疗过程中，中医们工作认真负责，总是耐心细致地为病人诊断，找出了病人过去用药不愈的重要原因，然后根据病情，确定了正确的治疗方法。许多病人经中医治疗后，病状都有了显著的起色。特别是对消化系的病（慢性肠胃炎）效果较大。如病员高智勇，患慢性肠胃炎已二年多了，总是食后呕吐，胸痛腹胀，大便常常带血，且合并神经衰弱，遗精等症，经长时期治疗未愈。后经中医的细心检查治疗，高智勇的疾病终于治好出院了。
    中医医疗组在康复医院的党和行政的领导下，始终和该院西医团结合作，并和伤病员建立了很好的感情。康复医院的领导上和同志们对他们也很尊敬，并表示要向他们学习。现在河南省人民政府卫生厅接受了康复医院的要求，正在积极组织第四期中医医疗组到该院工作。（王崑山、郭仁）
