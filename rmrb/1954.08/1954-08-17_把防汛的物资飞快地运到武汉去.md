At 9:20 PM on the 11th, a freight train, with each railcar displaying a "red note" indicating non-stop passage and priority shunting, departed from Beijing's Yongdingmen Station. Each railcar was loaded with flood prevention materials, another powerful support from the people of the capital to the flood fight in Wuhan. To date, 196 railcars of flood prevention materials have been transported from the capital to Wuhan, including large quantities of sacks, reed mats, water pipes, and grain.

The people of the capital have consistently supported the people of Wuhan fighting against the flood with great concern, and serve the flood prevention work in Wuhan with their selfless work. Starting at 5:00 PM on August 4th, people in the dispatch rooms and dispatch stations of the Beijing Transportation Company and the Beijing Railway Transportation Branch were working intensely through the night, dispatchers never taking the telephones from their ears. During the three days from August 4th to 6th, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives and other units in Beijing concentrated over 210,000 sacks and over 220,000 reed mats. In order to transport these flood prevention materials quickly, the Railway Bureau promptly dispatched over 100 railcars; the Beijing Transportation Company also allocated 89 trucks and over 300 loading and unloading workers to the intense transportation work. On August 4th, it was pouring rain. At this time, at 1:00 PM, the Beijing Transportation Company suddenly received the task of transporting 145,000 sacks concentrated from seventeen locations to the station, and at 11:00 PM, it received the task of transporting over 220,000 reed mats. Immediately, every transportation point was busy in the heavy rain. The Dachangmen Warehouse had a large loading capacity, so ten large trucks were immediately dispatched; the Huixiangting Warehouse did not have enough loading workers, so a team from the 8th Loading and Unloading Team was immediately dispatched to support; when it was discovered that the Yongdingmen Station had a weak unloading capacity, teams 12, 13, and 14 from the 9th Loading and Unloading Team rushed to help. Their actions were as coordinated as a single entity. When the truck drivers heard that they were to load materials to support the flood fight of the people of Wuhan, some had just returned to the factory from a trip, and some jumped back into the driver's seat without even having time to eat, released the parking brake, accelerated, and drove the trucks out again. Xu Da, a driver's assistant at the Beijing Transportation Company's motorcade, not only cranked his own truck to get it moving quickly, but also helped other trucks that had not started in time. Ni Lintang, the captain of the 4th Team, also drove a truck himself. The Xuanwu District Commercial Vehicle 9th Mutual Aid Group dispatched 94 vehicles to participate in the transportation, an increase of 5% over the usual report rate. Li Wende drove a six-wheeled truck, hauling sacks during the day and reed mats at night. Driver Meng Jirui and assistant Zhao Wenbin waited for dispatch in the truck carriage overnight, and the next day they were still energetic to transport reed mats.

The loading and unloading workers in the capital launched intensive labor to support the flood fight of the people of Wuhan. The 8th and 9th Teams of the 8th Loading and Unloading Team, with 27 people, were assigned 24 cargo positions, starting at 7:00 PM, with trucks arriving continuously. They unloaded reed mats until 2:00 AM the next morning; Team Leader Song Qicheng asked, "Are the comrades tired?" The answer was a single voice, "No, fire and water are unforgiving, the disaster of the people of Wuhan is our disaster, we won't be tired even if we work for another three nights." By 6:10 AM, they had completed the task of forty cargo positions. He Yulin, a 52-year-old loading and unloading worker, automatically acted as a dispatcher when the trucks lined up at the entrance of the station's freight yard, directing many trucks in an orderly manner - this one goes to the 6th line, that one goes to the 4th line. When he saw a truck carrying the most reed mats arrive, he happily directed it to unload to the 3rd line. In the Huang Yunrui Team at the Zhaogongkou Warehouse, they not only loaded trucks in the dark in conditions of poor lighting, being drenched in heavy rain, and stepping on mud, but also changed the reed mats from flat loading to vertical loading, increasing each truck from 17 bundles to 23 bundles, shortening the transportation time.

The flood prevention materials supported by Beijing to Wuhan were concentrated from various trade systems throughout the city. In order to transport them quickly and in a timely manner, the employees of the Beijing branch of the China Native Produce Company set out in the rain to inspect and collect the materials sent to Wuhan by various units. Che Zebo was not usually proficient at riding a bicycle, and the streets were muddy due to the rain, but tonight he rushed ahead of others as if flying, for some unknown reason. Qiu Zewu, 56, and three others from the Beijing Trust Company carefully checked the quality of the sacks, not allowing a single damaged sack to be used to support the flood fight of the people of Wuhan.

    把防汛的物资飞快地运到武汉去
    新华社记者　张瑾　周定舫
    十一日晚上九点二十分，有一列每节车皮上都挂着一枚表示沿途不停、优先挂车的“红笺”的货车，从北京的永定门车站开出了。列车的每节车皮都装满防汛物资，这是首都人民对武汉人民防汛斗争的又一次有力的支援。至此，由首都运往武汉的防汛物资已达一百九十六车皮，其中有大批的麻袋、芦席、水管和粮食。
    首都人民一直以极大关怀支援战斗在洪水面前的武汉人民，并且以自己忘我的工作为武汉防汛工作效力。从八月四日下午五时开始，在北京市运输公司和北京市铁路运输分局的调度室里和调度所里，人们通宵紧张地工作着，调度员的耳朵上一直没有离开过电话机。八月四日到六日的三天当中，北京市国营商业部门和合作社等单位就集中了二十一万多条麻袋、二十二万多领芦席。为了把这些防汛物资迅速地运送出去，铁路局便及时调来一百多个车皮；北京市运输公司也抽调了八十九辆汽车和三百多个装卸工人，投入紧张的运输工作中。八月四日，倾盆大雨。就在这个时候，北京市运输公司在下午一点钟突然接到从十七处集中十四万五千条麻袋运往车站的任务，夜间十一点又接到运输二十二万多领芦席的任务。顿时各个运输点上都在大雨中忙碌起来。大红门仓库装车能力大，一下就调来十辆大卡车；回香亭仓库装车工人不够用，立刻调装卸第八中队的一个小队来支援；刚发现永定门车站卸车能力薄弱，装卸第九中队的十二、十三、十四小队已赶来帮助。他们的动作协同的像一个整体。汽车司机们听说要装运支援武汉人民防汛斗争的物资，有的是刚刚出车回厂，有的是连饭也没来得及吃又跳上车座，倒上快闸，加大油门又把车子开出去了。北京市运输公司汽车场司机助手徐达为了使汽车尽快地驶出去，不但给自己的车子摇车，还给其他没能及时发动的汽车帮忙。四中队队长尼林堂也亲自开车。宣武区商车第九互助组发车九十四辆参加运输，比平时报班出车率增加百分之五。李文德驾驶一辆六轮大卡车，白天拉完麻袋，夜里又去运输芦席。司机孟继儒、助手赵文斌待命发车，在车厢里呆了一宵，第二天仍是精神勃勃地去运输芦席。
    首都的装卸工人为支援武汉人民防汛斗争，展开紧张劳动。装卸八中队第八、第九小队二十七个人，分配二十四个货位，从晚上七点开始，汽车无间断地驶来。卸芦席到第二天的清早二点钟；小队长宋启成问道：“同志们累吗？”回答的是一个声音，“不，水火不容人，武汉人民的灾害，就是我们的灾害，再来三个通宵也不累。”到六点十分他们竟完成了四十个货位的任务。五十二岁的老装卸工人何玉林，当汽车在车站货场门口插起来的时候，他就自动担任调度员，有秩序地把许多汽车加以指挥——这辆到第六线去，那辆到第四线去。当他看到一辆载着最多芦席的车来到时，他愉快地指挥它卸到第三线去。在赵公口仓库的黄云瑞小队，他们不但在照明设备很差、头上淋着大雨、脚下踩着污泥的情况下来摸黑装车，并且把芦席由平装改为立装，每车由装十七捆增加到二十三捆，缩短了运输时间。
    北京支援武汉防汛的物资，是从全市各个贸易系统集中来的。为了迅速而及时地运输出去，中国土产公司北京市公司的职工们冒雨出发，验缴各个单位送往武汉的物资。车泽波平时骑车子并不内行，再加下雨，街道泥泞，但今夜不知道为什么，他飞奔似的赶到别人前面。北京市信托公司五十六岁的邱则吾等四人，一直仔细地检查麻袋的质量。不让一个破烂的麻袋用去支援武汉人民的防汛斗争。
