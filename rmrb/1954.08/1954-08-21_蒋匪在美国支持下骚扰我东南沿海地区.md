(Xinhua News Agency, August 20th) The Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit troops entrenched in Taiwan, with the support of the United States, are intensifying their harassment and piracy activities against our southeast coastal areas.

In July, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant navy and bandit troops entrenched on the islands shelled our merchant ships and foreign ships trading with our country four times and attacked our coasts and coastal islands sixteen times. On the morning of July 18th, remnant bandits entrenched on Dadan Island shelled the British merchant ship "Jen Hsiu Hua" sailing outside Xiamen Port trading with our country. In July, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant air force bombed and strafed our coastal areas twice. On July 6th, four U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek F-47 aircraft raided our Zhoushan area, dropping two bombs and strafing our ships. At that time, our People's Air Force dispatched aircraft to strike the enemy planes, shooting down two enemy planes and damaging two enemy planes in fierce air combat.

Since August, the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops have been constantly harassing our southeast coastal areas. On August 1st, two Chiang Kai-shek remnant naval warships attacked our coastal defense troops in the sea near Chongwu, Fujian, and fled after one warship was damaged by our army. In addition, in the first half of August, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant navy and the remnant bandit troops entrenched on Jinmen Island shelled our coasts and coastal islands three times and ambushed our patrol boat team once. Chiang Kai-shek remnant air force planes harassed our coastal areas many times and bombed and strafed our Xiangshan and Nanding Island twice.

During this period, the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops constantly carried out piratical robbery and looting against our fishing boats at sea, disrupting our fishermen's production. According to incomplete statistics, in July, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops hijacked three of our fishing boats in the coastal areas of Zhejiang. In one and a half months from July 1st to August 15th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops hijacked sixteen of our fishing boats in the coastal areas of Fujian.

    在七月份内，蒋匪残余海军和盘踞在海岛上的匪军，炮击我商轮和同我国通商的外国船只四次，袭击我海岸和沿岸岛屿十六次。七月十八日晨，盘踞在大担岛上的残匪发炮轰击行驶在厦门港外同我国通商的英国商轮仁秀华号。蒋匪残余空军在七月份内，轰炸、扫射我沿海地区两次。七月六日，美造蒋匪F——四十七型飞机四架偷袭我舟山地区，投弹二枚，并扫射我船只。当时，我人民空军出动打击敌机，在激烈空战中击落敌机二架，击伤敌机二架。
    八月以来，残余蒋匪军更不断骚扰我东南沿海地区。八月一日，蒋匪残余海军军舰二艘在福建崇武附近海面袭击我海防部队，遭我军击伤军舰一艘后逃去。另外，蒋匪残余海军和盘踞金门岛的残余匪军在八月上半月内，曾炮击我海岸和沿海岛屿三次，偷袭我巡逻艇队一次；蒋匪残余空军飞机多次骚扰我沿海地区，并两次向我象山和南碇岛进行轰炸、扫射。
    在这个期间，残余蒋匪军不断对我海上渔船进行海盗式劫夺和抢掠，破坏我渔民生产。据不完全统计，在七月份内，蒋匪军在我浙江沿海劫走我渔船三只。在七月一日到八月十五日一个半月内，蒋匪军在福建沿海劫走我渔船十六只。
