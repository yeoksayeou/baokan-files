Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The first session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress continued its meeting on the 18th.

    The representatives discussed and examined in groups the report on the work of publicizing and discussing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. Wu Han, a member of the Beijing Draft Constitution Discussion Committee, gave a detailed explanation of the work of publicizing and discussing the Draft Constitution of China in Beijing in his report at the meeting on the 17th. After the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, the people of Beijing conducted large-scale publicity on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and now they have begun to discuss the Draft Constitution chapter by chapter and article by article. At present, 510,000 people have participated in the discussion (excluding the central government agencies). Through publicity and discussion, the broad masses of the people have further recognized the superiority of the people's democratic system, enhanced their consciousness and sense of responsibility as masters of the country, strengthened their confidence in striving to fulfill the general task of the country during the transition period, and have begun to become a driving force for promoting production, work, and study. The discussion of the Draft Constitution in Beijing will end in late August. During the period from the end of the discussion to the convening of the National People's Congress meeting, Beijing will still conduct publicity among the people through reading newspapers, broadcasting, and other methods.

    At the meeting, the representatives expressed their satisfaction with the achievements made by the Beijing Draft Constitution Discussion Committee in organizing the national discussion of the Draft Constitution. Many groups also discussed the Draft Constitution chapter by chapter and article by article at the meeting. Through this discussion, the meeting concentrated the opinions of the people of the city, expressed the feelings of the people of the city in support of the Draft Constitution, and their love for the motherland. They unanimously expressed that they would use practical actions to greet the upcoming First National People's Congress meeting and the birth of the first constitution of our country.

    The representatives also discussed and reviewed the report made by Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, on the final financial accounts of Beijing for 1953 and the financial budget for 1954 on the 17th. Because Beijing implemented the central government's instructions on increasing production, increasing income, practicing strict economy, and tightening expenditures on the basis of economic development, and carried out in-depth and extensive campaigns to increase production and practice economy in the city's enterprises, institutions, and administrative organs, vigorously increasing income and strictly tightening expenditures, the total income in 1953 exceeded the original budget by 31.89%, the actual expenditure was 90.89% of the original budget, and the surplus was 374.3 billion yuan. Regarding the financial budget for 1954, the total income increased by 1.96% compared with the actual income in 1953. Judging from the income situation in Beijing over the years, it has been rising year by year. For example, taking the actual total income in 1950 as 100, it was 238 in 1951, 355 in 1952, 634 in 1953, and 647 in the 1954 budget. Moreover, in the income over the years, the proportion of payments made by state-owned enterprises has become larger and larger, and the proportion of payments made by private industrial and commercial enterprises has gradually decreased. It can be said that the basis of the income budget is reliable and stable. In terms of expenditure, the vast majority of expenditures in 1954 are used for the development of local state-owned industry, agriculture, municipal construction, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings, that is, economic construction expenses account for 46.29% of the total expenditure, an increase of 14.64% over the actual expenditure in 1952; social, cultural, educational, and health expenses account for 34.65% of the total expenditure, an increase of 11.79% over the actual expenditure in 1953; and administrative management expenses account for 13.26% of the total expenditure. In order to accumulate funds for industrialization, Beijing's administrative management expenses have been decreasing year by year in the total expenditure. 1954 is 2.15% lower than 1953, 8.52% lower than 1952, and 16.12% lower than 1951. Other expenditures and reserve funds account for 5.74%. Judging from the implementation in the first half of the year, Beijing's 1954 financial budget is close to the actual situation. By the end of June, the total income has completed 44.97% of the original budget.

    When discussing the report on the financial budget and final accounts, the representatives felt that this report fully reflected the further improvement of the socialist economy in socialist construction and the further improvement of the people's material and cultural life. Many representatives from factories and suburbs, as well as representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, expressed that they would further increase production, increase income, practice strict economy, and support and implement Beijing's 1954 financial budget.

    北京市人民代表大会会议讨论宪法草案
    并讨论和审查了市政府去年财政决算和今年财政预算
    据新华社讯：北京市第一届人民代表大会第一次会议十八日继续举行会议。
    代表们分组讨论和审查了北京市宣传、讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案工作的报告。关于北京市宣传、讨论宪法草案的工作，北京市宪法草案讨论委员会委员吴晗在十七日会议上所作的报告中作了详尽说明。宪法草案公布后，北京市人民对中华人民共和国宪法草案进行了大规模的宣传，现在并已开始了对宪法草案的逐章逐条的讨论。目前参加讨论的已有五十一万人（中央直属各机关尚未统计在内）。经过宣传和讨论，广大人民群众进一步认识了人民民主制度的优越性，提高了人民群众的当家作主的自觉性和责任感，增强了为完成国家在过渡时期的总任务而奋斗的信心，并已开始成为推动生产、工作和学习的动力。北京市宪法草案的讨论工作，将在八月下旬结束。在讨论结束到全国人民代表大会会议召开这一期间，北京市仍将通过读报、广播等方式经常在人民群众中进行宣传。
    会议上，代表们对北京市宪法草案讨论委员会在组织全民讨论宪法草案中所取得的成绩，感到满意。许多小组还在会上对宪法草案作了逐章逐条的讨论。经过这个讨论，会议集中了全市人民讨论的意见，表达了全市人民拥护宪法草案的心情和对祖国热爱的感情。他们一致表示要用实际行动，迎接即将召开的全国人民代表大会第一次会议，迎接我国第一个宪法的诞生。
    到会代表也讨论和审查了北京市人民政府副市长张友渔十七日所作的关于北京市一九五三年度财政收支决算和一九五四年度财政收支预算的报告。北京市由于在经济发展的基础上贯彻执行了中央关于增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支的指示，在全市企业、事业部门和行政机关深入地、广泛地开展了增产节约运动，大力增加收入，严格紧缩开支，一九五三年度总收入超过原预算百分之三十一点八九，实际支出为原预算的百分之九十点八九，结余三千七百四十三亿元。关于一九五四年度财政收支预算，总收入比一九五三年实际收入增加百分之一点九六。从北京市历年的收入情况来看，是逐年上升的。如以一九五零年度实际总收入为一百，一九五一年度为二百三十八，一九五二年度为三百五十五，一九五三年度为六百三十四，一九五四年度预算为六百四十七。而且在历年收入中，国营企业缴纳所占的比重越来越大，私营工商业缴纳的比重逐渐下降。可以说收入预算的基础是可靠的，稳当的。在支出方面，一九五四年度支出的绝大部分是用在发展地方国营工业、农业、市政建设和文教卫生事业等，即经济建设费用占总支出的百分之四十六点二九，比一九五二年度实际支出增加百分之一十四点六四；社会文教卫生费用占总支出的百分之三十四点六五，比一九五三年实际支出增加百分之一十一点七九；行政管理费用占总支出的百分之十三点二六。为了积累工业化资金，北京市的行政管理费在总支出中逐年下降。一九五四年比一九五三年降低百分之二点一五，比一九五二年降低百分之八点五二，比一九五一年降低百分之十六点一二。其他支出及预备费占百分之五点七四。根据上半年的执行情况来看，北京市一九五四年度财政收支预算是接近实际的，到六月底为止，总收入已完成原预算的百分之四十四点九七。
    代表们在讨论财政收支预、决算的报告时，都觉得这个报告充分反映了社会主义经济在社会主义建设中有了进一步的提高，人民的物质和文化生活有了进一步的改善。许多来自工厂和郊区的代表以及工商界的代表都表示，今后要进一步增加生产，增加收入，厉行节约，支持和执行北京市一九五四年度财政收支预算。
