    Strive to comprehensively fulfill this year's basic construction plan
    Liang Da
    The eleven departments of the Central People's Government completed 35 percent of the annual basic construction plan in the first half of this year. Calculated based on the comparable nine departments, the amount of basic construction work completed in the first half of this year increased by 55 percent compared to the same period last year. This shows that this year's basic construction work has progressed a step further than last year.
    However, we must not ignore the fact that beneath the figures showing better completion of the basic construction plan in the first half of this year compared to last year, certain serious shortcomings in basic construction are still being concealed. From the perspective of progress: first, many departments have not completed their original plans. The Central First Ministry of Machine Building planned to complete 37.8 percent of the annual plan in the first half of the year, but actually only completed 29.2 percent. The Iron and Steel Industry Administration of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry planned to complete 30 percent of the annual plan in the first half of the year, but actually only completed 27.9 percent. Second, the progress of key projects lags behind the progress of general projects. Easier projects are completed more, complex projects are completed less. Key projects undertaken by state-owned construction enterprises under the Central Ministry of Construction only completed 17.44 percent of the annual plan in the first half of the year. The key projects of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry hardly completed their plans in any month during the first half of the year. Third, progress is uneven, and many construction enterprises still use rush tactics to catch up on progress.
    The quality of projects in the first half of the year is also unsatisfactory. According to statistics from only thirty construction enterprises under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, 390 quality accidents occurred in April alone, of which 252 required rework. Anshan Iron and Steel Company had a total of 447 quality accidents by May. Almost none of the key projects undertaken by the Central Ministry of Construction did not have quality accidents. For example, in the First Automobile Factory's thermal power plant project, 32 of the 79 column bases had quality accidents. Although installation projects have not yet been extensively launched, there have already been many quality accidents. After installing 123 machines in a workshop of the Shenyang First Machine Tool Factory, a review in June found that only eight were qualified. A spot check of 23 machines in the factory's tool workshop revealed that 20 were deformed.
    Not all construction enterprises have studied the task of reducing project costs proposed by the Central Committee and formulated specific measures plans; or although specific measures plans have been formulated, they have not been shared with the masses and have not aroused the enthusiasm of the vast number of employees to reduce project costs together. Some engineering companies have assigned the task of reducing costs to the finance department, and the engineering department has not taken action; some engineering companies have organized special committees, but have not combined with various business departments, and the work of reducing costs cannot be carried out; some engineering companies initially assigned the work of reducing project costs to the supervision office, then to the finance section, and then to the construction section, and reducing costs became a matter that no one managed and no one cared about.
    Work-related injuries in the first half of the year were also relatively serious. Fifteen major injury accidents occurred in Beijing in the first half of this year, which is more serious than the work-related injuries in the same period last year. Two more major injury accidents occurred in the first half of July.
    These shortcomings in basic construction in the first half of the year are most serious in industrial construction projects. In general, the preparation work for this year's industrial construction projects was better than last year's. Design drawings, especially foreign design drawings, arrived earlier, and the arrival of equipment and materials was also better. The technical strength was generally able to meet the needs. The construction conditions in all aspects were better than last year, but the progress of these industrial construction projects is not satisfactory. What is the reason?
    The main reason is that industrial construction is an extremely complex new job. Although the organizational leadership work of our construction and installation enterprises has greatly improved compared with the past when engaged in civil construction, it is still far behind the needs of large-scale and technically complex industrial construction. This is a prominent contradiction in the current basic construction work. The main characteristic of current basic construction is that the proportion of industrial construction is constantly increasing, and will continue to increase in the future. Taking the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry as an example, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry is the department that has built the most industrial projects in the past. Last year, it built complex industrial construction projects such as seamless steel pipe plants, large rolling mills, and the Seventh Blast Furnace. This year, the proportion of industrial construction projects of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry is even greater, and the technology is more complex. Factory building construction has increased by 69 percent compared with last year, metal structure engineering has increased by 45 percent compared with last year, and equipment installation engineering has increased by 60 percent compared with last year. These large-scale and technically complex industrial construction projects have posed many difficulties for us. In particular, the 141 projects that the Soviet Union is helping China build are all enterprises equipped with the world's most advanced technology, and thousands of new technical problems will be encountered during construction. More scientific organizational management is required, but our understanding and efforts in this regard are far from enough. In order to comprehensively complete this year's basic construction plan, and in order to improve the management level of our construction and installation enterprises, vigorously improve organizational leadership and adapt to the needs of industrial construction is an urgent task.
    The shortcomings in the organizational leadership work of construction and installation enterprises are multifaceted. For example, many departments have implemented specialization of construction, expanding some comprehensive engineering companies into several specialized engineering companies to jointly contract a project. This is necessary to ensure the progress and quality of industrial construction projects, to cultivate specialized technical forces, and to systematically accumulate experience. However, after specialization, the most important issue is how to organize the coordinated action of various specialized engineering companies. This requires an overall construction plan, it requires correct reflection of the construction relationship between various specialized engineering companies in the construction organization design (mainly in the arrangement of construction procedures and site configuration), in the operation plan, and in the frequent balancing work. This is a problem that has not been well resolved. Many civil construction engineering companies, acting as general contractors, have done a very poor job in organizing the construction of second-tier engineering companies because of their lack of experience and their inability to take care of themselves.
    For example, many engineering companies have adopted factory-based and mechanized construction methods, which is extremely important for ensuring the progress and quality of industrial construction projects and for reducing crowding at construction sites. However, although many engineering companies have established various processing plants and prefabrication plants, and although they have established mechanized supply stations, they have not led this work well. Some processing plants often have thousands of workers producing dozens of products, supplying the needs of dozens of units, but many of these processing plants have not yet seriously implemented operation plans, and the management system is extremely chaotic. Products can be arbitrarily transported by porters from various units. The maintenance and repair of mechanical equipment and the organization of the use of machinery are also poorly done. The limited mechanical equipment has not been able to exert its due effectiveness. The utilization rate of construction machinery generally only reaches about 25 percent. This shows that the leading cadres of these engineering companies have not truly recognized the important position of these affiliated enterprises in basic construction and have not taken various measures to strengthen the leadership of these affiliated enterprises. The backwardness of affiliated enterprises has caused serious obstacles to the progress of industrial construction projects.
    For example, many engineering companies have established scientific testing institutions for materials. Many important projects stipulate that the use of steel must undergo physical tests, chemical tests, tensile tests, and cold bending tests. Moreover, steel materials without factory certificates or non-batch steel materials must be tested one by one. These regulations are very important for ensuring construction quality. However, this work is also not well organized, and the testing content and methods are not clear enough. Either the testing content is incomplete, and problems are found after the materials are used; or the testing method is wrong, and usable materials are judged to be unusable, causing unnecessary waste.
    Improving the organizational leadership work of construction and installation enterprises is an arduous task that requires long-term unremitting efforts. First of all, it is necessary to strengthen the overall concept, the spirit of cooperation, and organization and discipline, and oppose departmentalism and local viewpoints. Industrial construction must have specialized division of labor, but it must also be unified and centralized. Only under unified and centralized leadership is specialized division of labor possible. Unified and centralized leadership must be built on the ideological foundation of the overall concept, the spirit of cooperation, and organization and discipline. Any departmentalism and local viewpoints will harm the overall situation.
    Secondly, it is necessary to prevent and overcome the one-sided leadership method. Large-scale industrial construction projects are constantly raising new issues for us. If we are limited to one corner and cling to one task, we will not be able to solve these problems and will not be able to move forward. We should not forget that grasping the central task is certainly necessary, but the purpose of grasping the central task is to promote the progress of the overall work. If we relax the other work that must be done well to achieve this goal and grasp the center in isolation, we will inevitably delay the progress of other work. Therefore, those one-sided practices of grasping progress and relaxing quality; grasping the construction site and forgetting the affiliated enterprises; grasping the grassroots and abandoning the overall plan are all wrong. In order to comprehensively grasp the work, we must give full play to the role of functional institutions and make them a powerful assistant to the leadership.
    Thirdly, we must oppose complacency. Industrial construction is an arduous and complex task. Our past experience is only the experience of civil construction and general industrial construction, and this experience is very little and very immature. In the face of new industrial construction, we must also study hard and diligently. Any complacency will bring losses to the country's construction cause. At present, it is necessary to criticize harmful arguments such as "it is a common rule to be loose at the beginning and tight at the end" and "last year's first half was worse than this year's, and it was all caught up, so there is nothing to be afraid of this year." It is necessary to educate all employees to maintain a humble and prudent style and a vigorous fighting spirit.
    In order to comprehensively complete this year's basic construction plan, in addition to improving the organizational leadership work of construction and installation enterprises, we must also pay special attention to preventing the tendency to neglect project quality and construction safety. It must never be thought that if the progress is tight, quality requirements can be relaxed and construction safety can be ignored. On the contrary, precisely because the progress is tight, rework is even more unacceptable. Any major quality accident will inevitably delay the progress of the project; precisely because the progress is tight, a higher attendance rate is required. Any major work-related injury accident will weaken the technical strength of the construction and thereby delay the progress of the project. Therefore, to ensure the completion of the progress plan, it is necessary to simultaneously ensure project quality and construction safety.
    Effective results must be achieved in reducing project costs in the next few months. If we allow various phenomena of wasting state property to continue to exist in this high tide of construction, we will not only fail to reduce project costs, but also be very likely to exceed the project budget and increase the country's financial expenditure.
    In order to complete this year's basic construction plan, various localities should organize construction in rainy weather and winter construction according to specific conditions, overcome the obstacles of natural conditions, and strive for more effective working days for construction.
    Basic construction is the main method for our country to realize socialist industrialization. The completion of each new factory and mine will increase the proportion of our country's total industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value. All basic construction cadres and employees, seize the time and strive to comprehensively complete this year's basic construction plan.

    争取全面完成今年的基本建设计划
    梁达
    中央人民政府十一个部今年上半年完成了全年基本建设计划的百分之三十五，按可比的九个部计算，今年上半年完成的基本建设工作量，比去年同期多了百分之五十五。这说明今年的基本建设工作比去年前进了一步。
    但是，我们绝不能忽视，在今年上半年基本建设计划完成得比去年好的数字下，还掩盖着基本建设中某些严重的缺点。从进度上看：首先是许多部门还没有完成原订的计划，中央第一机械工业部计划在上半年完成年计划百分之三十七点八。实际只完成百分之二十九点二，中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局计划在上半年完成年计划百分之三十，实际只完成百分之二十七点九。其次是重点工程的进度落后于一般工程的进度。易做的工程完成得多，复杂的工程完成得少，中央建筑工程部国营建筑企业承建的重点工程上半年只完成年计划百分之十七点四四。中央重工业部有色金属工业管理局各重点工程上半年几乎没有一个月完成计划。第三是进度不均衡，许多建筑企业仍然存在着用突击办法赶进度的现象。
    上半年的工程质量也是不能令人满意的。中央重工业部只就三十个建筑企业的统计，仅四月份就发生质量事故三百九十次，其中需要返工的就有二百五十二次，鞍山钢铁公司到五月份止，共发生质量事故四百四十七次，中央建筑工程部承建的重点工程几乎没有一项不发生质量事故。其中如第一汽车厂热电站工程七十九个柱基有三十二个发生质量事故。安装工程虽还没有大量展开，但质量事故已经不少。沈阳第一机床厂有一个车间安好一百二十三台机器，经六月份复查，只有八台合格，该厂工具车间抽查二十三台机器，发现变形的就有二十台。
    中央提出的降低工程成本的任务也不是所有的建筑企业都研究了，都制订了具体措施计划；或者虽然制订了具体措施计划，但并没有和群众见面，还没有激起千万职工群众一起来降低工程成本的热情。有的工程公司把降低成本的任务交给财务部门，工程部门没有行动起来；有的工程公司组织了专门委员会，但没有和各业务部门结合，降低成本的工作无法进行；有的工程公司始而把降低工程成本的工作交给监察室，继而交给财务科，再又转给施工科，降低成本就变成谁也管，谁也不管的事情。
    上半年的工伤事故也是比较严重的。北京市今年上半年发生重大伤亡事故十五起，较去年同一时期的工伤事故严重。七月份上半月又发生两件重大伤亡事故。
    上半年基本建设中的这些缺点，以工业建设工程最为严重。今年工业建设工程的施工准备工作一般是比去年做得好的，设计图纸，特别是国外设计图纸到达较早，设备和材料到达的情况也较好，技术力量一般也还能适应需要，各方面的施工条件都比去年好了，但是，这些工业建设工程进展的情况却并不令人满意，原因何在呢？
    主要原因就在于工业建设是一个极其复杂的新的工作，我们建筑安装企业的组织领导工作，比起过去从事民用建筑时虽大有改进，但仍远远落后于规模巨大、技术复杂的工业建设的需要，这是当前基本建设工作中一个突出的矛盾。当前基本建设的主要特点，在于工业建设的比重不断增长，而且在今后仍将继续不断地增长。以中央重工业部为例，中央重工业部是过去建设工业工程最多的部门，去年曾建设过无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂及七高炉等复杂的工业建设工程，今年中央重工业部工业建设工程的比重更大了，技术也更复杂了，厂房建筑比去年增加了百分之六十九，金属结构工程比去年增加了百分之四十五，设备安装工程比去年增加了百分之六十。这些规模巨大、技术复杂的工业建设工程在我们面前摆下了重重困难，特别是苏联帮助我国建设的一百四十一个项目，都是以世界上最先进的技术装备的企业，施工中更会遇到成千上万新的技术课题。要求有更科学的组织管理工作，而我们在这方面的认识和努力都是很不够的。为了全面完成今年的基本建设计划，为了提高我们建筑安装企业的经营管理水平，大力改进组织领导，适应工业建设的需要，乃是一个刻不容缓的任务。
    建筑安装企业的组织领导工作，所存在的缺点是多方面的。例如许多部门实行了施工的专业化，将一些综合性的工程公司扩大为几个专业工程公司，共同承包一个工程，这对于保证工业建设工程的进度和质量，对于培养专业的技术力量和系统地积累经验，都是必要的。但是专业化之后，一个最重要的问题就是如何组织各个专业工程公司协同动作，这就需要有整体的施工规划，需要在施工组织设计上（主要是在施工程序的安排和场地配置上），需要在作业计划上，需要在经常的平衡工作中，去正确地体现各个专业工程公司之间的施工关系，这却是一个没有很好解决的问题，许多作为总包单位的土木建筑工程公司由于他们缺乏经验，自顾不暇，组织二包工程公司施工的工作做得很差。
    再如许多工程公司采用了工厂化、机械化的施工方法，这对于保证工业建设工程的进度和质量，对于减少施工现场的拥挤，都是极其重要的。但是，许多工程公司虽然建立了各种加工厂和预制品厂，虽然建立了机械化供应站，却并没有很好的领导这项工作。有的加工厂往往有成千名工人在生产着数十种产品，供应数十个单位的需要，但是这些加工厂很多都还没有认真推行作业计划，管理制度极其混乱，产品竟可以听任各个单位的搬运工任意搬运。机械设备的维护检修工作和使用机械的组织工作也做得很不好，有限的机械设备远远没有能发挥应有的效能，施工机械的利用率一般只达到百分之二十五左右。这就说明这些工程公司的领导干部还没有真正认识到这些附属企业在基本建设中的重要地位，还没有采取各种措施去加强这些附属企业的领导。由于附属企业的落后，给工业建设工程的进展造成了严重的障碍。
    又如许多工程公司建立了材料的科学试验机构，许多重要工程上规定了使用钢材一定要经过物理试验、化学试验、拉力试验、冷弯试验，而且没有出厂证件的，非成批的钢材，还得一根一根的试验。这些规定，对保证建设质量都是十分重要的。但是，这项工作也是组织得不够好的，试验内容和方法都是不够明确的。不是试验的内容不全，材料使用后发现问题；就是试验的方法错误，可用的材料判为不可用，造成不必要的浪费。
    改进建筑安装企业的组织领导工作，是一个艰巨的任务，需要作长期不懈的努力。首先是要加强整体观念、协作精神和组织性、纪律性，反对本位主义和局部观点。工业建设必须分工专业，也必须统一集中，只有在统一集中的领导下，才有分工专业的可能，统一集中的领导必须建筑在整体观念、协作精神和组织性、纪律性的思想基础上，任何本位主义和局部观点都将贻害全局。
    其次，要防止和克服单打一的领导方法。规模巨大的工业建设工程无时无刻不向我们提出新的问题，如果我们局限于一隅，死抱着一项工作，就无法解决这些问题，就无法前进。我们不应该忘记，抓住中心工作固然是必要的，但抓住中心工作的目的是为了推动全盘工作的进展，如果我们放松了实现这个目的所必须做好的其他工作，孤立地抓中心，就必然会贻误其它工作的进展，因此，那种抓住进度，就放松了质量；抓住工地，就忘记了附属企业；抓住基层，就放弃了总体规划等等片面的做法都是错误的。为了全面地把工作抓起来，必须充分发挥职能机构的作用，使之成为领导的强有力的助手。
    再次，必须反对自满情绪，工业建设是一个艰巨的、复杂的工作，我们过去的经验，只是民用建筑和一般工业建设的经验，而且这些经验也是很少的，很不成熟的。在新的工业建设的面前，我们还必须刻苦钻研学习，任何自满情绪都会给国家建设事业带来损失。当前，就要批判那种“前松后紧是普遍规律”、“去年上半年比今年更糟，都给赶上了，今年不怕”等有害的论调，要教育全体职工保持谦逊谨慎的作风和旺盛的战斗精神。
    为了全面完成今年的基本建设计划，除了改进建筑安装企业的组织领导工作以外，还必须特别注意防止忽视工程质量和施工安全的偏向。决不能认为进度排得紧，就可以放松质量要求，就可以不注意施工安全。相反的，正因为进度排得紧，就更不允许返工，任何一件重大的质量事故必然会推迟工程的进度；正因为进度排得紧，就要求有更高的出勤率，任何一件重大的工伤事故，都将削弱施工的技术力量，从而推迟工程的进度。因此，要保证进度计划的完成，就必须同时保证工程质量和施工安全。
    降低工程成本的工作，在今后几个月内必须作出切实有效的成绩。如果在这大量施工的高潮里，听任各种浪费国家财产的现象继续存在，我们就不但不能降低工程成本，而且还极有可能超过工程预算，增加国家的财政支出。
    为了完成今年的基本建设计划，各地应该根据具体情况组织雨天施工和冬季施工，战胜自然条件的障碍，争取更多的施工有效工作日。
    基本建设是我们国家实现社会主义工业化的主要方法，每一个新的工厂和矿山的建成，都将增长我国工业生产总值在工农业生产总值中所占的比例。全体基本建设干部员工们，抓紧时间，争取全面完成今年的基本建设计划。
