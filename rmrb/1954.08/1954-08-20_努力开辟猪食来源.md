Since the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government issued instructions on developing hog production in April of this year, thanks to the attention of party and government leaders at all levels, and the efforts of all farmers, the number of pigs raised in various places has generally increased. According to a typical survey in Sichuan Province, the increase in general rural areas ranges from 14.4% to 20%; in the famous hog-producing area of ​​Jinhua Prefecture in Zhejiang Province, more than 1,050,000 farming households are currently raising more than 1,090,000 pigs, an increase of about 50% compared with February of this year; Wei County in Zhangjiakou Prefecture, Hebei Province, which had no habit of raising pigs in the past, had only 3,700 pigs in the entire county at the end of 1953, but has now increased to 6,209; six agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province originally had 215 pigs, which have recently increased to 711; the state-owned Zhangye Farm in Gansu Province currently raises more than 490 pigs, an increase of more than 300 compared to last year. Various organs, troops, and schools have also started pig farming. The direct food units of the Changzhi, Linfen, and Yuci prefectural offices in Shanxi Province raised 879 pigs; the direct food units of Jincheng, Qinyuan and other three counties raised 581 pigs.

However, there are still many problems in developing hog production, one of the main problems being the insufficient supply of feed; many regions have not paid enough attention to this point. Some cadres and the masses still rely solely on commercial feed and do not realize the importance of opening up multiple sources of pig feed for saving grain and increasing hog production.

In order to further develop hog production, it is necessary to educate cadres and farmers to actively open up multiple sources of pig feed. At present, the experience of using rice husk bran to feed pigs should be vigorously promoted. Now, experiments and mass practices in various places have proved that using rice husk bran to feed pigs not only makes the pigs willing to eat and grow, but also greatly reduces the cost of feeding pigs. According to the experience of Liao Shanyuan and Yang Shurong mutual aid teams in the Fourteenth District of Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, who have been using rice husks to feed pigs for three months, frying the rice husks until yellow, grinding them finely, and cooking them thick, properly mixed with oil cake (20 jin of rapeseed cake per 100 jin), feeding each large pig 3 jin per day, medium-sized pigs 2 jin, and piglets 1 jin, and intermittently feeding green feed, the effect is very good. The two mutual aid teams suffered a drought last year, and the corn kernels were not harvested. The original plan to raise 10 fat pigs this year felt that the feed was difficult, but since using rice husks to feed pigs, they have sold 12 fat pigs so far, and plan to raise 32 more fat pigs. The reason is that the cost of each jin of rice husks processed and mixed with oil cake is only 260 yuan. This reduces the cost of concentrate feed for pigs by two-thirds compared with feeding corn; and reduces the cost of rice bran by about 50%, thus greatly reducing the cost of pig raising. At present, some areas in Sichuan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Heilongjiang and other provinces are testing and promoting this experience. Guangdong Province also unifies the processing and manufacturing of rice husks by the grain department, and entrusts the cooperatives to promote it throughout the province. Li Zhaojian, secretary of the Fourteenth District Committee of Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, has successively held district and township cadre meetings since February this year to educate cadres, solve practical problems in promotion, and check and summarize experience from time to time, and promote it in a timely manner. At present, 10% of the farmers in the district use rice husks to feed pigs.

It is estimated that if all rice-producing areas in our country use rice husks to feed pigs, the existing number of pigs raised can be doubled, and millions of tons of grain can be saved for the country.

Because pigs are omnivorous animals, there are many items that can be used as feed. Generally, wild grass, pond weeds, vegetables, wild fruits, leaves, stems and leaves of melon vegetables, silage corn stalks, and sweet potato vines and leaves can all be used to feed pigs. These green feeds contain a large amount of protein, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which can promote the development of piglets and increase the fattening speed of large pigs. Xiaoshan, Xiangshan and other counties in Zhejiang Province held forums for women representatives and pig-raising experts, and found more than 40 kinds of wild feed; Pingshan County, Sichuan Province, Shaanxi, Shanxi and other provinces used corn cobs to feed pigs in individual places, and Hebei Province used peanut shells to feed pigs, with good results. This shows that there are many sources of pig feed. As long as we can educate the masses, tap the potential and collect a large amount, we can appropriately solve the difficulty of insufficient supply of commercial feed, which is conducive to the development of the pig industry.

Many areas have mobilized the masses to plant feed crops on the sides of fields and plots. Zhejiang Province plans to promote the planting of 9.8 million mu of alfalfa and milk vetch. In some areas of the South, they are seizing the opportunity to promote the planting of high-yield chard (each mu can harvest 20,000 to 30,000 jin) and planting "lazy sweet potatoes" (each mu can harvest 8,000 jin of vines). These are also good ways to open up multiple sources of pig feed.

While actively mobilizing the masses to increase feed production and advocating the use of substitutes to feed pigs, all localities should pay attention to promoting the method of refining coarse feed. In terms of refining coarse feed, the fermented feed promoted in Dalian City and the sweet potato vine silage of farmers in Sichuan Province are worthy of attention, utilization and promotion.

While opening up multiple sources of feed, all localities should also appropriately solve the problem of supplying miscellaneous grains. In places where new-type primary grain markets have been established, farmers should be facilitated to mutually adjust small amounts of miscellaneous grains as feed to increase hog feed. In addition, the supply and adjustment of commercial feed should also be strengthened. At present, some areas have not done enough to educate farmers to use various bean cakes and oil cakes for fertilizing fields to feed pigs, and some cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives still have the idea that "using cake fertilizer to feed pigs will affect the supply of commercial fertilizer," and have not fully understood the spirit of the instructions of the Central Financial and Economic Committee on developing hog production. This should be corrected quickly.

    努力开辟猪食来源
    赵长城　陈友仁
    自今年四月间中央人民政府财政经济委员会发出关于发展毛猪生产的指示以后，由于各地党政领导方面的重视，和全体农民的努力，各地养猪数量已普遍增加。据四川省典型调查，一般农村增加百分之十四点四到二十；浙江省著名毛猪产地金华专区一百零五万多农户，目前已养猪一百零九万多头，比今年二月份时增加了百分之五十左右；河北省张家口专区蔚县过去没有养猪习惯，一九五三年终全县仅有三千七百口猪，现已增至六千二百零九口；山西省六个农业生产合作社原有猪二百十五只，新近增加到七百一十一只；国营甘肃省张掖农场现养猪四百九十多头，比去年增加三百多头。各地机关、部队、学校也都开展了养猪业，山西省长治、临汾、榆次三专署直属伙食单位养了八百七十九头；晋城、沁源等三个县直属伙食单位养猪五百八十一头。
    但目前在发展毛猪生产方面还存在不少问题，其中主要问题之一，是饲料供应的不足；不少地区对这一点也重视不够。有些干部和群众还存在着单纯依赖商品饲料的思想，没有认识到多方面开辟猪食来源对节约粮食，增产毛猪的重要意义。
    为了进一步发展毛猪生产，必须教育干部和农民积极地多方面开辟猪食来源，目前首先应大力推广采用稻壳糠喂猪的经验。现在各地的试验和群众的实践都已证明，采用稻壳糠喂猪不但猪肯吃肯长，而且大大降低喂猪成本。据四川省江津县十四区廖善元、杨树荣两互助组三月来用稻壳喂猪的经验，把稻壳炒黄、碾细、煮浓，适当配合油饼（每百斤掺二十斤菜籽饼），每头大猪日喂三斤，架子猪二斤，仔猪一斤，并间喂青饲料，效果很好。两个互助组去年遭旱灾，玉米颗粒未收，原计划今年养肥猪十头都感到饲料困难，自使用稻壳喂猪后，迄今已出售肥猪十二头，还计划再养三十二头肥猪。原因是用稻壳加工后混合油饼，每斤的成本仅二百六十元。这样使喂猪的精料成本较用玉米喂猪减少三分之二；较用米糠成本减少约百分之五十，因此使养猪成本大大降低。现在四川、广东、浙江、黑龙江等省部分地区已在试验推广这个经验。广东省并由粮食部门统一加工制造稻壳，委托合作社向全省推广。四川省江津县十四区区委书记李昭见同志今年二月以来曾先后召开区乡干部会议，教育干部，解决推广中的实际问题，并随时检查，总结经验，及时推广，目前全区已有百分之十的农户用稻壳喂猪。
      估计我们全国水稻产区如果都用稻壳喂猪，即可将现有养猪数增加一倍，并为国家节约数百万吨粮食。
    由于猪是杂食性动物，可作饲料的物品很多。一般野生草、池塘水草、青菜、野果、树叶、瓜菜芋艿的茎叶，青贮玉米秸秆和红薯藤叶等，大都可以喂猪。这些青饲料多含有大量蛋白质、维他命及炭水化合物，可以促进小猪各部发育，增加大猪育肥的速度。浙江省萧山、象山等县召开妇女代表及养猪能手座谈会，就找出了四十多种野生饲料；四川省屏山县、陕西、山西等省个别地方采用玉米心喂猪、河北省采用花生壳喂猪，效果都很好。由此可见，可作猪食料的来源是很多的，只要我们能教育群众，挖掘潜力大量采集，就能适当解决商品饲料供应不足的困难，而有利于养猪业的发展。
    很多地区都已发动群众就田边地头种植饲料，浙江省计划推广种植苜蓿、金花菜九八○万亩，南方部分地区抓紧推广种植产量高的牛皮菜（每亩可收二、三万斤）和种植“懒人红薯”（每亩可收割藤蔓八千斤），这些也都是多方面开辟猪食来源的好办法。
    各地在积极发动群众增产饲料，提倡代用品喂猪时，应注意推广粗料精喂的办法。在粗料精喂方面，旅大市推行的醱酵饲料，四川省农民的薯蔓青贮，都是值得注意利用和推广的。
    各地在多方面开辟饲料来源的同时，还应适当地解决杂粮供应问题。在建立了新型的初级粮食市场的地方，应便利农民相互调剂少量杂粮充作饲料，以增加毛猪饲料。此外，对商品饲料的供应调剂也应加强。目前有些地区对教育农民用肥田的各种豆饼、油饼喂猪积肥还做得很不够，个别供销合作社干部还存在“饼肥喂猪影响商品肥料供应”的思想，对中央财政经济委员会的关于发展毛猪生产的指示的精神还领会不足。这是应该迅速纠正的。
