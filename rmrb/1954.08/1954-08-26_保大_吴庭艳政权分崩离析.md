    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Since the realization of peace in Vietnam, the Bao Dai-Ngo Dinh Diem regime, despised by the Vietnamese people, is increasingly falling into a state of disintegration.

    The Bao Dai puppet troops in North Vietnam are rapidly collapsing after the signing of the armistice agreement. According to reports from American and French news agencies, large numbers of puppet soldiers are laying down their arms, putting on civilian clothes, and going home. Some battalions have been reduced to half or a quarter of their original strength. A United Press reporter even said that this "is no longer a matter of desertion, but simply no army at all."

    The infighting within the Bao Dai group is also becoming more intense. Many elements who previously supported Bao Dai and Ngo Dinh Diem are now openly opposing them and demanding their resignation. This includes the leaders of the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao sects, which possess armed forces. United Press reported on the 17th that Saigon was filled with a growing sentiment demanding the resignation of the Ngo Dinh Diem government. Ngo Dinh Diem has become so isolated that he only works with his brothers, relatives, and a small number of supporters from North Vietnam. Recently, Tran Van Soai, the "Commander-in-Chief" of the Hoa Hao armed forces, publicly issued a statement attacking Ngo Dinh Diem, and Nguyen Thanh Phuong, the military leader of the Cao Dai sect, publicly announced that he no longer recognized Bao Dai as the "Head of State." Many people in the puppet regime are talking about ousting Bao Dai from the "throne."

    保大—吴庭艳政权分崩离析
    据新华社讯：越南的和平实现以后，为越南人民所唾弃的保大—吴庭艳政权，正日益陷于分崩离析的局面。
    北越的保大伪军在停战协定签订以后正在迅速瓦解。据美国和法国通讯社报道，大批大批的伪军士兵放下武器，穿上便衣，回家去了。有些营的人数已经减少得只剩下一半或四分之一。合众社记者甚至说，这“已经再不是什么开小差的问题了，而是根本没有军队了”。
    保大集团内部的倾轧，也越来越厉害了，许多过去支持保大和吴庭艳的分子，现在公开起来反对他们，要求他们下台，其中包括了拥有武装力量的教派高台教和和好教的首领。合众社十七日报道说，西贡充满了要求吴庭艳政府辞职的日益增涨的情绪，吴庭艳已经孤立到这样的程度，以致只有他的弟兄们、亲戚们和从北越来的支持他的少数人和他共事。最近，和好教的武装部队“总司令”陈文瑞公开发表声明攻击吴庭艳，高台教的军事首领阮性方公开宣布不再承认保大是“国家元首”。伪政权中有许多人在谈论要把保大从“皇座”上赶下去。
