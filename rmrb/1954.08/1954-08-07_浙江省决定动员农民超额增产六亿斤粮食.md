Zhejiang Province Decides to Mobilize Farmers to Increase Grain Production by 600 Million Jin
    The leading bodies of Zhejiang Province have decided to launch a campaign among farmers to increase grain production by 600 million jin.

    The expanded meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, held in late July, analyzed the province's agricultural production situation and various conditions for increasing production. The meeting considered that after more than 98% of the province's rice seedlings had been transplanted, most areas had already achieved a good harvest of early rice, a good harvest of mid-season rice was in sight, and late rice and miscellaneous grain crops were growing well. As long as measures such as increasing fertilizer application and strengthening field management are taken for the province's more than 18 million mu of late rice and late autumn crops, it is possible to strive for an additional increase of 10 jin of grain per mu. After the harvest of the province's more than 13 million mu of early and mid-season rice and dry-land early-maturing miscellaneous grain crops, in addition to the originally planned planting of more than 5 million mu, an additional 4.5 million mu of one-crop-a-year can be strived for, with each mu producing 100 jin of grain. By striving in these two aspects, the province can increase grain production by more than 600 million jin. Therefore, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to mobilize farmers throughout the province to strive for an increase of more than 600 million jin of grain. It also urgently instructed rural Party committees at all levels to immediately take measures to grasp mutual aid and cooperation as the center and quickly launch a campaign to increase grain production.

    At present, local committees and county committees of the Communist Party of China in Zhejiang Province are convening or have convened expanded meetings to comprehensively analyze the local production situation, identify key points for increasing production, formulate plans for increasing grain production, and study how to use agricultural producers' cooperatives as the center to drive mutual aid teams and individual farmers to carry out this movement. In Jinhua, Quzhou, and other special districts where the season is earlier and mostly three crops a year or two crops a year, 18 counties and cities have already formulated plans to increase grain production. Jinhua Special District plans to mobilize farmers to plant one more crop on more than 800,000 mu of idle land after the harvest of early and mid-season rice; and in the autumn harvest, it will mobilize farmers to harvest and thresh carefully, striving to harvest an additional 5 jin of rice per mu. The entire special district plans to increase grain production by more than 220 million jin. Tonglu, Lanxi, and other counties in this special district plan to expand the planting area of late autumn crops by more than double compared to last year, and will try to plant more corn, which has a higher yield. Thirty-five agricultural producers' cooperatives in Tonglu County have already led more than 200 mutual aid teams to formulate plans to increase grain production. The campaign to increase grain production throughout the province is about to begin in full swing. (Xinhua News Agency)

    浙江省决定动员农民超额增产六亿斤粮食
    浙江省领导机关决定发动农民超额增产六亿斤粮食。
    七月下旬召开的中共浙江省委员会扩大会议，分析了全省农业生产的情况和各项增产条件。会议认为：全省百分之九十八以上的水稻插下秧后，目前绝大部分地区早稻已经丰收，中稻丰收在望，晚稻和杂粮作物生长良好。全省一千八百多万亩晚稻和晚秋作物，只要采取增施肥料、加强田间管理等办法，每亩可争取再增产十斤粮食。全省一千三百多万亩早中稻和旱地早熟杂粮作物收割后，除原计划种植五百多万亩外，可再争取四百五十多万亩多种一熟作物，每亩能生产一百斤粮食。从这两方面努力，全省就能超额增产粮食六亿斤以上。因此，中共浙江省委员会决定动员全省农民为超额增产六亿斤粮食而奋斗。并紧急指示各级农村党委立即采取措施，掌握以互助合作为中心，迅速开展超额增产粮食的运动。
    目前中共浙江省各地方委员会和各县委员会正在分别召开或已经召开扩大会议，全面分析当地生产情况，找出增产重点，制订超额增产粮食的计划，并研究如何以农业生产合作社为中心带动互助组和单干农民开展这一运动。季节较早、大部为一年三熟制或两熟制的金华、衢州等专区，已有十八个县、市订出超额增产粮食的计划。金华专区准备在早中稻收割后，动员农民把八十多万亩休闲田多种一熟作物；并在秋收中发动农民细收细打，争取每亩多收五斤稻谷。全专区计划超额增产粮食两亿两千多万斤。这个专区的桐庐、兰溪等县准备晚秋作物种植面积比去年扩大一倍多，并将尽量多种产量较高的玉米。桐庐县三十五个农业生产合作社已经带动两百多个互助组订出超额增产粮食的计划。全省超额增产粮食的运动即将全面展开。（新华社）
