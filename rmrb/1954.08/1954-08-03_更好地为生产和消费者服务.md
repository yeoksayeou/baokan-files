Collecting Folk Pattern Designs
The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company recently sent two investigation and research teams to key cities and villages in Central South and East China to collect folk pattern designs as a basis for further improving the variety of fabric patterns.
Since October of last year, the station has designed more than fifty kinds of brightly colored patterns based on consumer preferences. More than half of these patterns have been made into beautiful floral fabrics and sold throughout the country. The "Peacock Spreading Its Tail" floral fabric processed by the station last year has been very popular because of its novel design and national characteristics. The sales volume has exceeded 600,000 bolts in just over a year, creating a record for the sales volume of a single pattern. It is expected that through this survey, the station will have a broader understanding of the needs of urban and rural people and will discover a batch of rich and colorful pattern designs.

Six Thousand New-Style Waterwheels
The Production Materials Supply Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Cooperative Union plans to supply farmers with 6,000 new-style waterwheels this year. As of early July, more than 5,040 units had been sent to more than 20 counties, including Chang'an, Hu County, and Fuping.
The vast majority of these 6,000 waterwheels are Liberation-style, with a small number being small five-wheel waterwheels. Along with the supply of waterwheels, more than 36,700 parts such as tubes, leather cushions, and leather coins have been prepared. In order to ensure the supply of a large number of waterwheels to help farmers strive for a bumper autumn harvest, the Northwest Administrative Committee's Water Conservancy Bureau has also prepared a batch of waterwheels that can be supplied flexibly.

New Ice Storage in Coastal Fishing Ports
Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company has decided to build eight ice storage facilities in fishing ports along the coast of eastern Guangdong, such as Pinghai and Aotou. Three ice storage facilities in Pinghai, Shenao, and Jiazi have been completed, and the rest can also be completed this year.
In the past, there were few cold storage facilities in the local fishing areas, and most of the aquatic products were immediately processed and salted on the spot, so that residents of industrial, mining, and urban areas could not eat many fresh marine aquatic products, and canned aquatic product factories sometimes felt that the raw material supply was insufficient. At the same time, the purchase price of aquatic products prepared for fresh sales is higher than the price of those prepared for salting, but due to the small number of cold storage facilities, most aquatic products can only be used for salting; in order to sell their fish fresh, fishermen often return to port immediately after catching some fish to "catch the first market," which does not fully utilize production time. The establishment of these ice storage facilities can increase the supply of fresh aquatic products and is conducive to fishery production.

Bouyei Farmers Light Up Kerosene Lamps
Fourteen of the twenty-one Bouyei families in the fourth group of Heizhai Township, Second District, Qinglong County, Guizhou Province, have lit kerosene lamps. Before liberation, the Bouyei farmers here could not light oil lamps at all, and relied on burning fires and other methods for lighting at night.
After liberation, the production of the Bouyei farmers developed, and they lit oil lamps at night. Recently, the supply and marketing cooperative of the Second District supplied them with kerosene lamps, and the situation is even better. They all happily said: If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the worker brothers, we wouldn't be able to use glass lamps. In the future, we must work hard to increase production and support national industrial construction. In the future, when we reach socialist society, we will also use electric lights!

Fresh and Cheap Garlic Sprouts All Year Round
Shenyang Municipal Cooperative General Office recently used cold storage to store more than one million catties of garlic sprouts, which can ensure that the city has fresh and cheap garlic sprouts all year round. This is the second time that garlic sprouts have been stored in such a large quantity. The first time was in May 1953, when the Vegetable Management Department of the Supply Department of the Shenyang Municipal Cooperative General Office used simple earthen ice cellars to cold store 730,000 catties of garlic sprouts in Kaiyuan County, and the local people could still buy cheap and fresh garlic sprouts until the Spring Festival this year.
Garlic sprouts are very popular food among the people of Northeast China, but their production season is too short. Every year when garlic sprouts come down, they cannot be sold in time, and farmers do not have the strength to store them, so they are often largely rotten; once the production season is over, consumers have to pay high prices but cannot buy them. Shenyang Municipal Cooperative General Office began studying garlic sprout cold storage methods in 1952. Last spring, it cold-stored a large number of garlic sprouts in Kaiyuan, the garlic sprout production area, and until the Spring Festival this year, residents of Kaiyuan County could buy a catty of fresh garlic sprouts for a maximum of 4,000 yuan. This batch of ice cellar-stored garlic sprouts also supplied the needs of cities such as Beijing, Anshan, and Changchun.

In the Flood-Stricken Areas
Due to excessive rainfall, some areas along the Yangtze River in Huanggang Special District, Hubei Province, have experienced flooding. The supply and marketing cooperatives of the special district promptly organized 76 wooden boats and more than 80 mobile supply teams to patrol and supply the needs of dike repair workers and the masses in the flooded areas. In addition to supplying oil, salt, rice, firewood, and other items, they also supply steamed buns, pickles, and other cooked foods, and purchase local and special products. The six delivery boats of the Lanxi District Cooperative in Xishui County have more than 40 kinds of daily necessities and more than 10 kinds of production materials; the health department has also sent cadres to participate and provide mobile medical treatment for the disaster victims. In the three days from June 21st to 23rd, they supplied daily necessities worth more than 9.4 million yuan and production materials such as seeds and fertilizers, and at the same time sold more than 6.6 million yuan worth of local and special products for the disaster victims, including more than 3,100 catties of scrap iron and more than 180 catties of broken rubber shoe soles.

Cadres Promoting New Farm Tools
The Northeast Regional Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives recently held a training class for cadres to promote new farm tools. More than 110 cadres from the entire region participated in this study. Technicians from the Northeast Administrative Committee's Agricultural Bureau and the Shenyang and Lingshan Farm Tool Factories combined physical objects to teach courses, so that the students became familiar with the construction, loading and unloading, operation methods, and storage and maintenance of new-style plows, harrows, sowing machines, harvesters, and hoeing machines and other new farm tools. The students also visited the Shenyang Farm Tool Factory to understand the manufacturing process of new farm tools. The students all pledged to do a good job in promoting new farm tools and help farmers improve production.

Construction Site Consumer Cooperatives in Luoyang City
The Luoyang Municipal Cooperative Union of Henan Province recently established consumer cooperatives for construction site workers, and has successively established six outlets at basic construction sites. At present, these six consumer cooperative outlets supply construction workers with daily necessities worth an average of more than 8 million yuan every day. The cadres of the consumer cooperatives not only implement a "linked work system" in the outlets so that workers can buy goods at any time, but also brave the heat to transport sweets, cigarettes, bread, etc. to the construction sites. The consumer cooperatives at the construction sites have to transport a large number of fresh vegetables and other foods from more than 20 miles away to the construction sites every day; the salespersons sometimes have to transport these goods in the rain or on foot. The outlet of a consumer cooperative at a certain basic construction site has also prepared a batch of books that workers can read after get off work.

    更好地为生产和消费者服务
      收集民间花样图案
    中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站最近派出两个调查研究小组，到中南、华东各重点城市和乡村，搜集民间花样图案，作为进一步改进布匹花色品种的依据。
    该站自去年十月以来，根据消费者的爱好，设计了五十多种色彩鲜艳的花样图案。其中已有半数以上的图案制成美丽的花布，行销全国各地。该站去年组织加工的孔雀开屏花布，由于花样新颖，又带有民族色彩，到现在不过一年光景，销出数量已超过了六十万匹，创造了一种花型销售量的最高纪录。预计通过这次调查，该站将更广泛地了解城乡人民的需要，并将发现一批丰富多采的花样图案。
    六千部新式水车
    陕西省合作社联合社生产资料供应经理部今年准备供应农民新式水车六千部，到七月初，即已发往长安、鄠县、富平等二十多个县五千零四十多部。
    这六千部水车绝大部分是解放式的，少部分是小五轮水车。在供应水车的同时，还准备了管炼、皮垫、皮钱等三万六千七百多件零件。为了保证有大量水车供应，以便帮助农民争取秋季作物丰收，西北行政委员会水利局还准备了一批可以机动供应的水车。
      沿海渔港的新冰库
    广东省水产供销公司决定在粤东区沿海的平海、澳头等渔港建筑八个冰库。平海、神澳、甲子等地的三个冰库已经完成，其余的也可在今年建成。
    过去当地渔产区冷藏设备很少，水产品大都立即就地加工腌制，以致工矿、城市居民吃不到很多鲜美的海洋水产品，水产罐头工厂有时也感原料供应不足。同时，水产品准备用来鲜销的收购价格比准备拿来腌制的价格为高，但是由于冷藏设备少，大部分水产品只能拿来腌制；渔民为了使鱼货能够作为鲜销出售，往往捕得一些鱼后就立即回港“赶头市”，这样就不能充分利用生产时间。这些冰库的建立，可以增加鲜美水产品的供应量，并有利于渔业生产。
    布依族农民点上了煤油灯
    贵州省晴隆县第二区黑寨乡第四组的二十一户布依族农民，已经有十四户点上了煤油灯。解放以前，这里的布依族农民根本点不上油灯，夜里只靠烧火等办法来照明。
    解放以后，布依族农民的生产发展了，夜里点上了油灯。最近，第二区供销合作社供应给他们煤油灯，情况就更好了。他们都高兴地说：要不是毛主席和工人老大哥，我们是用不上玻璃灯的。今后我们一定要努力增加生产，支援国家工业建设。将来到了社会主义社会，我们还要用电灯哩！
    四季都有新鲜便宜的蒜毫
    沈阳市合作总社最近用冷藏法储存了一百多万斤蒜毫，可以保证该市一年四季都有新鲜价廉的蒜毫。这样大量地储存蒜毫，已是第二次了。第一次是在一九五三年五月间，沈阳市合作总社供应处蔬菜经理部在开原县城用简易的土冰窖冷藏了七十三万斤蒜毫，直到今年春节，当地人民还能买到廉价的、新鲜的蒜毫。
    蒜毫，东北人民很喜欢食用，但是它的生产季节太短。每年蒜毫下来的时候，一时销售不了，农民没有力量储藏，便往往大批烂掉；产季一过，消费者花高价却也买不到。沈阳市合作总社从一九五二年就开始研究蒜毫冷藏办法，去年春天在蒜毫产地——开原冷藏了大批蒜毫，直到今年春节，开原县城的居民最多用四千元就能买到一斤新鲜蒜毫。这批冰窖冷藏的蒜毫还供应了北京、鞍山、长春等城市的需要。
      在水灾地区
    湖北省黄冈专区沿江部分地区因雨水过多，发生水灾。该专区供销合作社及时组织了七十六只木船、八十多个流动供应小组，巡回供应修堤民工和受水淹地区群众的需要。他们除供应油、盐、米、柴等物品外，还供应馒头、酱菜等熟食，并且收购土产和特产。浠水县兰溪区合作社的六只送货船上有四十余种生活资料，十余种生产资料；卫生部门也派干部参加，流动为灾民诊治疾病。他们在六月二十一日到二十三日的三天中，供应了价值九百四十多万元的生活用品和种籽、肥料等生产资料，同时为灾民推销了六百六十余万元的土产、特产等物品，其中包括三千一百余斤废铁，一百八十多斤破胶鞋底。　（王本直）
      推广新农具的干部
    中华全国合作社联合总社东北区办事处最近举办了一期推广新式农具干部训练班。全区一百一十多名干部参加了这一学习。东北行政委员会农业局、沈阳和灵山农具厂的技术员结合实物讲授课程，使学员们熟悉了新式犁、耙和播种机、收割机、铲?机等新式农具的构造、装卸、操作方法和保管保养等方面的基本知识和技术。学员们还参观了沈阳农具厂，了解了新式农具的制造过程。学员们都保证要作好新式农具的推广工作，帮助农民提高生产。
      洛阳市的工地消费合作社
    河南省洛阳市合作社联合社最近建立了建筑工地职工消费合作社，并先后在基本建设工地设立了六个门市部。目前，这六个消费合作社门市部，每天平均都供应给建筑工人价值八百余万元的生活日用品。消费合作社的干部们不仅在门市部实行“连带上班制”，让工人们能随时买到货物，还冒着炎热把糖果、纸烟、面包等运送到工地。建筑工地职工消费合作社每天要把大批新鲜蔬菜和别的食品，　　从二十多里路以外运到工地；营业员有时还要冒雨或者徒步来运送这些货物。某基本建设工地消费合作社门市部还准备了一批书籍，工人们下班以后，可以来阅览。
