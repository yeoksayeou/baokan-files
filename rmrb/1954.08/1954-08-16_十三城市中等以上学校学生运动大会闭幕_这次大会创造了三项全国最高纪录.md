The 1954 Thirteenth Cities Secondary and Higher Education Students’ Track and Field, Gymnastics Sports Meet victoriously concluded on August 14th after four days of intense competition.

This event fully demonstrated the spirit of unity, progress, and mutual learning among the student athletes, as well as the new sportsmanship of being humble in victory and undeterred in defeat. Three national records were created at this meet, including a new record in the men's javelin throw that broke the old record held for eighteen years. Five records broke the highest records created at the 1953 National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Sports Meet. Thanks to the arrival of the Soviet track and field team, Chinese student athletes learned many superior techniques and new sports ethics.

This event officially held competitions in gymnastics events such as uneven bars, balance beam, rings, and pommel horse. During the competition, some athletes had already relatively mastered the movements of Soviet first-class gymnasts.

Since the opening of the event, athletes and physical education teachers from all over the country have been exchanging experiences in dormitories, sports fields, and tree-lined avenues at any time and place. In every exhibition match involving Soviet athletes, the athletes carefully and enthusiastically learned the advanced techniques of the Soviet athletes.

At the closing ceremony held on the 14th, Li Nan, chairman of the conference and deputy mayor of the Lüda Municipal People's Government, delivered the closing speech. He said that the event had yielded great results, and he called on all athletes not to be complacent with their achievements. He urged all athletes to bring the spirit of the event back with them, so that mass sports activities in schools could be carried out more extensively and deeply, in order to further improve the health of students, improve learning efficiency, cultivate good qualities such as courage, perseverance, agility, optimism, and diligence, as well as the spirit of collectivism, and better prepare for labor and defending the motherland. At the closing ceremony, the twelve members of the presidium of the conference presented commemorative medals to the athletes of the Soviet track and field team, and representatives of Chinese athletes presented flowers to the Soviet athletes. Soviet athletes also presented the pennants they brought with them to the delegations from the thirteen cities. A. Gromadsky, the leader of the Soviet track and field team, warmly congratulated the achievements of the event at the meeting. Then, the conference presented awards to outstanding athletes and units.

After the closing ceremony, a friendly football match was also held.
