    The Longest Modern Highway Bridge on the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway
    The Xianyang Wei River Highway Bridge Completed and Opened to Traffic
    The longest modern bridge on the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway—the Xianyang Wei River Bridge—was officially completed and opened to traffic on August 1. On that day, the construction site was decorated with lanterns and colorful decorations, and a grand opening ceremony was held. More than 30,000 people from all walks of life attended the meeting.
    The Xianyang Wei River Bridge is the longest highway bridge built in the Northwest region since liberation. In the past, there was only one railway bridge spanning the Wei River in Xianyang, and cars could only use it for passage. After liberation, with the development of the national economy, this bridge could no longer meet the growing needs of transportation. According to recent estimates, each car has to wait an average of about 20 minutes to pass, which has seriously affected the exchange of materials. As for pedestrians, mules and horses, they all relied on wooden boats for transportation, which not only wasted time, but also had to stop during the annual flood season, cutting off traffic. After the opening of the Wei River Bridge, transportation efficiency can be greatly improved, and Xianyang, a newly emerging industrial city, and the Xi'an area will be more closely connected, greatly facilitating the exchange of industrial and agricultural products on both sides of the Wei River. The history of the "Xianyang Ancient Ferry" for thousands of years has also come to an end.
    During the construction of this bridge, it received guidance from Soviet experts and support from the local people and Tianjin and other places. The workers who participated in the construction of the bridge displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity. The piling team workers continued to work in the cold river water during the severe winter last year. Carpenter Yuan Quanfa created a construction method of pre-driving scaffolding piles, which ensured the safety of the lower foundation project and saved a lot of project costs; Youth League member Liu Zonghan created a stone chute, which doubled the working efficiency of the stone rolling machine; Shen Jiatai's group improved the operation method and labor combination of road surface gradation, which improved work efficiency. In the course of more than a year of construction, 58 people were named labor models and advanced workers.
    On the afternoon of the opening day, an exhibition of engineering pictures and technical innovation models was also held on the construction site; amateur peasant troupes also held celebratory performances.

    西兰公路最长的一座现代化公路大桥
    咸阳渭河公路大桥落成通车
    西（安）兰（州）公路上最长的一座现代化桥梁——咸阳渭河大桥已于八月一日正式落成通车。这一天，工地上悬灯结彩，举行了隆重的通车典礼。参加大会的有各界人民共三万多人。
    咸阳渭河大桥是西北地区解放以来修成的最长的公路桥。过去横跨咸阳渭河河面仅有一座铁路桥梁，汽车只能借用通行。解放后随着国民经济的发展，这一桥梁即不能满足交通运输日益增长的需要。据最近估计，每辆汽车平均约须等二十分钟左右才能通过，使物资交流受到严重的影响。至于行人和骡马大车往来全靠木船过渡，不仅耽误时间，而且每年洪水期间就要停渡，交通断绝。渭河大桥通车后，可使运输效率大大提高，并使咸阳这一新兴的工业城市和西安地区更密切地连成一片，大大便利渭河两岸工农业产品的交流。几千年来“咸阳古渡”的历史也就从此结束了。
    这座大桥在修建中得到了苏联专家的指导和当地人民群众和天津等地的支援。参加修建桥梁的职工们发挥了高度劳动热情和创造性。打桩队工人们在去年严冬仍继续在冰凉的河水中工作，木工元泉发并创造先打支架桩的施工方法，保证了下部基础工程的安全，节约了大量的工程费用；青年团员刘宗汉创造溜石槽，使轧石机的工作效率提高一倍；申家泰小组改进了路面级配的操作方法和劳动组合，提高了工作效率。一年多施工过程中，被评为劳动模范和先进工作者的就有五十八名。
    通车的当天下午，工地上还举行了工程图片、技术革新的模型展览；农民业余剧团等也举行了庆祝演出。
