    Ambassador Mononutu's Speech
    Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen:
    I am very grateful to have the opportunity to say a few words to you this evening.
    When I received the invitation from the People's Republic of China to send an art troupe to China, I felt that cultural exchange was very important between the two countries, in addition to economic and commercial relations.
    Currently, a Chinese trade delegation is in Indonesia negotiating with an Indonesian trade delegation to conclude a trade contract to supplement the trade agreement signed in Beijing on November 30th of last year between the Indonesian trade delegation and the Chinese trade delegation.
    I know that the trade negotiations in Jakarta have now reached their final stage and will be signed soon.
    The above two facts, namely: the Indonesian art troupe in China and the Chinese trade delegation in Indonesia, will certainly make a great contribution to consolidating the friendly relations between the two countries.
    As the representative of the Indonesian government in China, I express my pleasure at the above two facts. Let me express my gratitude to the Chinese government for now giving me such a good opportunity to consolidate the friendly relations between our two countries.
    I believe that cooperation between our two countries will not only enhance mutual understanding between China and Indonesia, but will also promote mutual understanding among all Asian nations. The friendly relations between our two countries will make a significant contribution to peace, especially in Southeast Asia and throughout the world.
    This, in my opinion, is the profound significance of the Indonesian art troupe's visit to China.

### 莫诺努图大使的讲话

专栏：

    莫诺努图大使的讲话阁下，女士们，先生们：
    我很感激，今晚得有机会同诸位说几句话。
    我接到中华人民共和国的邀请，派一艺术团前来中国的时候，我觉得文化的交流，在两国间是很重要的，除了经济和商业的关系之外。
    现在，在印度尼西亚有中国贸易代表团正在和印度尼西亚贸易代表团商洽，来订贸易合同，来充实去年十一月三十日印度尼西亚贸易代表团与中国贸易代表团在北京所签订的贸易协定。
    我知道，现在贸易谈判在雅加达已经达到了最后的阶段，不久就可以签字。
    以上这两个事实，就是：在中国的印度尼西亚艺术团和在印度尼西亚的中国贸易代表团，一定能在巩固两国的友好关系上有巨大的贡献。
    我以印度尼西亚政府在中国的代表的身分，对以上这两个事实表示快乐。让我向中国政府表示谢意，因为现在给了我这么好的机会来巩固我们两国的友好关系。
    我相信我们两国间的合作，不但能增进中国和印度尼西亚间的谅解，一定也能促进全亚洲各民族间的互相谅解。我们两国间的友好关系，特别对东南亚以及全世界的和平，将有重大的贡献。
    这在我看来是印度尼西亚艺术团来中国访问的深刻的意义。
