Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" published a political note on the 6th entitled "Thailand—U.S. Springboard in Southeast Asia." The article points out that the United States is stepping up the militarization of Thailand in preparation for launching new adventures in Indochina.

The article writes: "American military aircraft are rampaging across Thailand's rice paddies and forests. American officers are busily training young people in the Thai army to operate American machine guns to fire, and to drive American tanks to knock down obstacles such as bamboo houses and irrigation ditches. Many military supplies destined for Indochinese ports have been rapidly redirected to Bangkok, and American ships carrying these supplies are unloading their cargo."

The article asks why, when the flames of the Indochina War have been extinguished by the coordinated efforts of peaceful forces, and when the consolidation of friendly relations between Asian countries can be seen, has the interest of the American ruling clique in Thailand grown so much recently?

The article states: "Democratic public opinion in various countries, especially Asian countries, correctly notes that the intensification of American conspiracies in Thailand is precisely a continuation of the notorious 'strength' policy that has already suffered disastrous defeats in Korea and Indochina. It seems that some politicians who are accustomed to measuring Asian peoples with the old colonial yardstick have not benefited from the lessons of history." The article says that the American aggressor bloc, forgetting the enormous changes that have taken place in Asia, is trying desperately to suppress the national liberation movements of the awakened people. With this goal in mind, they are trying to piece together an aggressive alliance in Southeast Asia, an alliance that the Asian people resolutely reject.

The article points out: "In order to ensure the unimpeded implementation of American dictates, the Thai ruling clique has abolished the remaining civil rights and freedoms, is brutally dealing with all those concerned with democracy, and is creating intense anti-communist hysteria. The country's economy is being placed on a war footing."

The article concludes: "All these facts prove that those who dislike the termination of bloodshed in Indochina, the opponents of the Geneva Accords, have not given up the struggle. Facts show that the American aggressor bloc is attempting to turn Thailand into a base for launching new adventures into Indochina."

    泰国—美国在东南亚的跳板
    ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报的文章的摘要
    【新华社讯】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报六日发表题为“泰国——美国在东南亚的跳板”的政治扎记。这篇文章指出，美国正在为了准备在印度支那发动新的冒险而加紧把泰国军事基地化。
    文章写道：“美国军用飞机正在泰国的稻田和森林的上空横冲直撞。美国军官正在匆匆忙忙地训练泰国军队中的青年人开动美国机关枪来射击，坐着美国坦克来冲倒像竹屋子和灌溉渠那样的障碍物。以印度支那港口作为目的地的许多军需品已迅速地改以曼谷为目的地，装载这些军需品的美国船只正在卸货。”
    文章问道，为什么在和平力量通过协同的努力已经扑灭了印度支那战争的火焰，以及在可以看到亚洲国家之间友好关系的巩固的时候，美国统治集团对泰国这一方面的兴趣最近特别增长呢？
    文章说：“各国、首先是亚洲国家的民主舆论正确地注意到，美国在泰国的阴谋活动的加紧正是已经在朝鲜和印度支那遭到了惨败的恶名昭彰的‘实力’政策的延续。看来，若干惯于用古老的殖民的尺码来量度亚洲人民的政治家，并没有从历史教训中得到益处。”文章说，美国侵略集团，忘却了在亚洲已经有了巨大的变化，正在企图拚命来镇压已经觉醒起来的人民的民族解放运动。他们的心中抱着这一个目标来试图在东南亚拼凑一个侵略联盟，而这一个联盟是亚洲人民所坚决拒绝的。
    文章指出：“为了保证毫无妨碍地履行美国的绝对命令，泰国统治集团已经废除了残余的公民权利和自由，正在野蛮地对付一切关心民主的人，并制造激烈的反对共产主义的歇斯底里。国家的经济正被放在战争的基础上。”
    文章最后说：“这一切事实证明，那些不喜欢终止印度支那的流血的、日内瓦决议的敌对者们，并没有放弃挣扎。事实表明，美国的侵略集团正企图把泰国变为向印度支那发动新的冒险的基地。”
