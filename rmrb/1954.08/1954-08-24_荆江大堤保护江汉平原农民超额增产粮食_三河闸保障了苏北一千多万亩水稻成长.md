    Jingjiang Dike Protects Jianghan Plain Farmers, Achieving Over-Quota Grain Production
    Sanhe Sluice Guarantees Growth of Over Ten Million Mu of Rice in Northern Jiangsu

    In Hubei Province, on the Jianghan Plain protected by the Jingjiang Dike, the vast number of farmers, led by mutual aid and cooperation organizations, are striving to exceed their grain production quota by more than 500 million jin. In addition to expanding the cultivation of ratooning rice and intercropping buckwheat in green manure crop fields, farmers in various areas are also reclaiming more than 200,000 mu of vacant land and wasteland to plant various late autumn crops. Farmers in waterlogged areas are also vigorously draining water and replanting. To strive for a bumper harvest of late autumn crops, farmers in various areas are accumulating large amounts of fertilizer and improving agricultural techniques. Under the leadership of 99 mutual aid teams, farmers in Shengli Township, Tianmen County, accumulated more than 19,000 dan of fertilizer in three days. Construction departments, farms, and agricultural technology extension stations of various county people's governments are holding forums with elderly farmers, centered on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, to study and exchange advanced experiences in cultivating late autumn crops.

    Since the end of June, the people on the Jianghan Plain have organized a flood prevention army of more than 100,000 people to patrol the dikes and engage in flood control and rescue operations. At the same time, the people below the dikes have further intensified production. Up to now, thanks to the heroic and tenacious spirit displayed by the flood prevention army on the dikes and the full utilization of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the Jingjiang Dike has successfully weathered five dangerous flood peaks. In areas that have not been waterlogged or have been only slightly waterlogged, early rice has generally achieved a bumper harvest, and mid-season rice is ripening and will soon be harvested. Inspired by this great victory, the farmers on the Jianghan Plain actively responded to the call of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and decided to exceed their grain production quota by more than 500 million jin. In the past half month, county, district, and township expanded cadre meetings and representative meetings of mutual aid and cooperation organizations have been held in various areas. After full study and discussion, everyone further recognized the significant political and economic importance of carrying out the over-quota production movement. Mutual aid and cooperation organizations and the vast number of farmers in various areas have revised their original production increase plans and quickly plunged into the over-quota production movement.

    The Sanhe Sluice, built in the lower reaches of the Huai River as part of the Huai River harnessing project, has effectively controlled the Huai River flood during the Huai River flood season, ensuring the safe growth of over ten million mu of rice in more than ten counties, including Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Yancheng, and Jianhu, in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu Province. Currently, the mid-season rice in these areas is heading and flowering, and the early rice harvest has begun. This year, the rice in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu is growing better than last year in most areas, and it is estimated that the yield will increase by 10% to 20% compared to last year. In Xinghua County, the largest rice-producing area, the average rice yield this year is about 400 jin per mu; the highest can reach 600 jin, and it is estimated that the average yield per mu will be about 50 jin more than last year.

    The Sanhe Sluice is the largest sluice built in the Huai River harnessing project. The sluice body is more than 690 meters long, with a total of 63 openings. This year, when the exceptionally large flood of the Huai River flowed down from the upper and middle reaches, the huge Sanhe Sluice blocked a large amount of floodwater in Hongze Lake. The flood could only obediently follow people's commands and flow slowly downstream through the gates of the Sanhe Sluice. During the intense flood season of the Huai River, the Sanhe Sluice was always operated freely. In order to proactively meet the Huai River flood peak, the Sanhe Sluice fully opened all 63 gates before the flood peak arrived, discharging the water stored in Hongze Lake at a flow rate of 10,500 cubic meters per second. When the Huai River flood peak reached Hongze Lake, the discharge flow of the Sanhe Sluice was immediately reduced from 10,500 cubic meters per second to 9,800 cubic meters per second. Recently, in order to further ensure the dikes of the Grand Canal and protect the growth and harvest of over ten million mu of rice in northern Jiangsu, the discharge flow of the Sanhe Sluice has been controlled from 9,800 cubic meters per second to 8,000 cubic meters per second.

    荆江大堤保护江汉平原农民超额增产粮食
    三河闸保障了苏北一千多万亩水稻成长
    湖北省由荆江大堤保护着的江汉平原上，广大农民在互助合作组织带动下，正为超额增产粮食五亿多斤而努力。各地农民除扩大培育再生稻，在绿肥作物田里间种荞麦外，正在开垦二十多万亩空地和荒地，种植各种晚秋作物。受渍地区的农民也在大力排涝补种。为了争取晚秋作物丰收，各地农民都大量积肥，改进农业技术。天门县胜利乡农民在九十九个互助组的带动下，三天内就积肥一万九千多担。各县人民政府建设科、农场、农业技术推广站都以互助合作组织为中心，召开老年农民座谈会，研究交流了培育晚秋作物的先进经验。
    江汉平原上的人民六月底就组织十多万人的防汛大军，上堤防汛抢险，同时堤下的人们更进一步地加紧了生产。到目前为止，由于堤上的防汛大军发挥了英勇顽强的精神和充分运用了荆江分洪工程，荆江大堤已经胜利渡过五次险恶的洪峰。在没有受渍和受渍较轻的地区，早稻已普遍丰收，中稻正在黄熟，很快就可收割。在这一伟大胜利鼓舞下，江汉平原上的农民积极响应中共湖北省委员会的号召，决定超额增产粮食五亿多斤。近半月来，各地纷纷召开了县、区、乡扩大干部会和互助合作组织代表会等，经过充分研究讨论，使大家进一步认识了开展超额增产运动的重大政治意义和经济意义。各地互助合作组织和广大农民都修订了原来的增产计划，迅速投入了超额增产运动。　（新华社）

    淮河下游在治淮工程中修成的三河闸，在淮河防汛中有效地控制了淮河洪水，保障了江苏省北部里下河地区高邮、宝应、兴化、盐城、建湖等十多个县一千多万亩水稻的安全成长。现在这些地区的中稻正吐穗扬花，早稻已经开始收割。今年苏北里下河地区的水稻，大部分比去年长得好，估计产量可比去年增产一成到二成。产稻最多的兴化县，今年水稻产量每亩平均约有四百斤；最多的可达六百斤，估计平均每亩可比去年多收五十斤左右。
    三河闸是治淮工程中修建的最大的一个水闸。闸身长六百九十多公尺，共六十三孔。今年淮河特大的洪水从上、中游下泄时，巨大的三河闸把大量的洪水拦阻在洪泽湖里。洪水只能驯服地听从人们的指挥，通过三河闸的闸门，缓缓下泄。在淮河紧张防汛中，三河闸始终操纵自如。为了主动迎接淮河洪峰，在洪峰到来前三河闸即将六十三孔闸门全部开启，以一万零五百秒公方的流量排泄了洪泽湖的蓄水。当淮河洪峰到达洪泽湖时，三河闸下泄的流量又立即由一万零五百秒公方减缩到九千八百秒公方。最近为了进一步确保运河堤防，保障苏北地区一千多万亩水稻的成长和收割，三河闸洪水下泄的流量又从九千八百秒公方控制到八千秒公方。
