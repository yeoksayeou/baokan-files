Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 3rd: The Polish "People's Tribune" commented on the new destructive actions launched by the Syngman Rhee clique against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, saying: "The provocative actions against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission were planned by Syngman Rhee during his time in Washington, and this is not accidental. With the full support of his American protectors, Syngman Rhee openly clamored in his talks for 'strangling the armistice' and 'marching north.' The Washington and Syngman Rhee talks violated the armistice agreement and discussed the issue of the United States stepping up the supply of military equipment to South Korea."

The commentary said that in the past few months, the US military headquarters and the American-backed South Korean puppet have been trying to paralyze the activities of the Supervisory Commission, making it impossible for the commission to effectively supervise the implementation of the agreement, especially undermining the commission's supervision of the entry of US military equipment into South Korea. The recent provocative actions against the Supervisory Commission are just another link in the plan to undermine the armistice agreement and worsen the situation in Asia.

The commentary pointed out that all these provocative actions took place after the Geneva Conference, which is not accidental. The American aggressive bloc has not learned any lessons from their failures and is now trying at all costs to provoke war again in the Far East.

The "People's Tribune" said: "Just like the attempt to expand the war in Indochina some time ago, the American plan to undermine the Korean armistice has aroused public anger and resolute opposition. The provocative actions against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission exposed the true face of the Syngman Rhee gang's American protectors, and these actions will only lead to further isolation of the American aggressive bloc."

    波兰“人民论坛报”发表评论
    斥李承晚集团对中立国监察委员会的挑衅
     【新华社四日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙三日讯：“人民论坛报”评论李承晚集团对朝鲜中立国监察委员会发动的新的破坏行动说：对中立国监察委员会采取的挑衅行动是李承晚在华盛顿的时候策划的，这不是偶然的。李承晚在他的美国保护人的全力支持下，在他的谈话中公然叫嚣“扼杀停战”和“北进”。华盛顿和李承晚的会谈违反了停战协定，讨论的竟是美国加紧以军事装备供应南朝鲜的问题。
    评论说，在以往几个月中，美军司令部和美国扶植的南朝鲜傀儡一直在设法使监察委员会的活动陷于瘫痪，使委员会无法对协定的执行进行有效的监督，特别是破坏委员会对美国军事装备运入南朝鲜的监察。最近对监察委员会进行的挑衅行动只不过是破坏停战协定并使亚洲局势恶化的计划中的又一环节而已。
    评论指出，所有这些挑衅行动都发生在日内瓦会议之后，这不是偶然的。美国的侵略集团并没有从他们的失败中吸取任何教训，现在正不惜一切代价试图在远东再度挑起战争。
      “人民论坛报”说：正如在若干时候以前要扩大印度支那战争的企图一样，美国破坏朝鲜停战的计划已经引起了舆论的愤怒和坚决的反对。对中立国监察委员会进行的挑衅行动暴露了李承晚匪帮的美国保护人的真面目，这种行动只会导致美国侵略集团的进一步的孤立。
