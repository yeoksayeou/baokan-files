    The production internships for students of national higher industrial schools have basically concluded, and they are returning to their schools one after another.
    This year, over 49,000 students from national higher industrial schools participated in production internships, most of them starting in July and spending four to eight weeks in major factories, mines, and enterprises across the country. The content of the internships focused on specialized production, with some students also participating in introductory internships. Most of the students participating in production internships directly engaged in production operations and practical work as foremen, section chiefs, inspectors, and assistant shift engineers. During the internships, the students initially applied their learned technical and theoretical knowledge. Second-year students of the Welding Specialization Course at Tianjin University, interning at the Dalian Crane Factory, had the opportunity to comprehensively apply the arc welding, automatic welding, and structural inspection courses they had learned at school, further solidifying their theoretical knowledge. Second-year students of the Metalworking Tool Specialization Course at Jiaotong University consolidated their knowledge of mechanical manufacturing technology by learning to draft process regulations. Xiong Zhanyong, a student from Harbin Institute of Technology interning at the construction site of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, said, "In the past, our designs were limited by textbook knowledge. Seeing the construction of the carpentry workshop this time has inspired creativity in architectural design." Many students also completed individual assignments during their internships. Students from the Industrial Enterprise Electrification Specialization Course at Nanjing Institute of Technology, interning at Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, helped workers improve the automatic start-stop device of the double-gantry cylinder boring machine and successfully designed and trial-produced the machine tool's automatic tool retraction, rapid tool advance, and reverse cutting device. Although students from the Power Plant Distribution Network and Joint Transmission System Specialization Course at Tsinghua University had studied relevant power generation courses before the internship and participated in the installation internship of new power plants, they only had some concepts about the operation methods of power plants. After the operation internship at the Dalian Power Plant, each student learned the operation management methods. All three students they nominated passed the worker grade examination for operators. Some students from the Mineral Geology and Exploration Specialization Course at Beijing Mining College felt before the internship that the knowledge learned in the two years of the specialization course was too little to be competent for practical work, but they demonstrated a certain working ability during the internship and strengthened their confidence in participating in work in the future.
    During their internships, students from various schools also helped production units solve many practical problems. Second-year students of the Welding Specialization Course at Tianjin University, interning at the Dalian Crane Factory, completed the task assigned to them by the factory of formulating three process regulations, including the manufacturing of single-beam cranes and automated welding of oil tanks. Students from the Metalworking Specialization Course at Shandong Institute of Technology, interning at Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, assisted the factory in formulating more than 30 types of gear operation cards and modifying nearly 100 types of process cards, helping the factory improve some cutting tools and fixtures. Students from Chongqing University interning in the metalworking workshop of Chongqing Air Compressor Plant proposed a suggestion to simplify the planer process, which improved equipment utilization. Civil engineering students from Qingdao Institute of Technology, interning at a construction site of a certain engineering company in Beijing, assisted workers in overfulfilling production tasks and improving workers' labor productivity. Fourth-year students from Harbin Institute of Technology, interning in various work areas at the construction site of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, put forward 41 rationalization proposals in terms of construction technology and on-site management, of which 15 were adopted and 11 could be adopted. Yan Shichao, a student majoring in industrial and civil building structures at Tianjin University, served as an assistant to the bricklayer foreman at the construction site of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and put forward 17 rationalization proposals related to rainy season construction and wall paneling. Students from the Water Conservancy Technology and Construction Specialization Course at Wuhan University Water Conservancy College, interning at the Nanwan Reservoir, studied the problem of soil moisture content and proposed suggestions for reasonable coordination of various tasks such as digging, crushing, piling, transporting, and filling soil for earthen dams, so that the soil for filling the earthen dam reached the standard moisture content, saving a lot of man-hours and expenses for the production department.

    全国高等工业学校学生生产实习基本结束
    全国高等工业学校学生生产实习已基本结束，正陆续返回学校。
    今年全国高等工业学校参加生产实习的有四万九千多人，大部分从七月开始在全国各地重要厂矿企业单位进行了为期四周到八周的生产实习。实习内容以专业生产实习为主，还有一部分学生参加认识实习。参加生产实习的学生大部分以工长、工段长、检验员和值班工程师助手等身分直接参加生产操作和实际工作。在实习中学生们初步运用了所学技术理论知识。在大连起重机厂实习的天津大学焊接专修科二年级学生在校所学的电弧焊、自动焊、结构检验等课程，在实习中获得综合运用的机会，使理论知识更加巩固。交通大学金工工具专修科二年级学生通过学习拟订工艺规程，巩固了机械制造工艺学的知识。在第一汽车制造厂工地实习的哈尔滨工业大学学生熊占永说：“过去我们做设计，受着书本知识的限制。这次看到木工厂的建筑启发了对建筑设计的创造力。”不少学生在实习中还作了个人作业。南京工学院工业企业电气化专修科二年级在沈阳重型机器厂实习的学生，帮助工人改进了双杠式镗缸机的自动启闭器，设计并试制成功机床的自动退刀、快速进刀和反向吃刀装置。清华大学发电厂配电网及联合输电系统专修科的学生，在实习前虽然学过有关发电课程，并参加过新式发电站的安装实习，但对电厂的运行方法只有一些概念。经过在大连电厂的运行实习，每个学生都学会了运行管理方法。他们所推选的三个学生全都通过了运转员的工级考试。北京矿业学院矿产地质和勘探专修科有些学生在实习前，认为专修科二年学到的知识太少，不能胜任实际工作，但他们在实习中表现了一定的工作能力，坚定了将来参加工作的信心。
    各校学生在实习中还帮助生产单位解决了许多实际问题。天津大学焊接专修科二年级学生在大连起重机厂实习时，完成了工厂交给他们的制定制造单梁吊车和自动化焊接油罐等三项工艺规程的任务。山东工学院金工专修科在济南第一机床厂实习的学生，协助厂方制订了齿轮操作卡片三十多种，修改工艺卡片等近百种，帮助工厂改进了一些刀具和夹具。重庆大学在重庆空气压缩机厂金工车间实习的学生，提出简化刨床工序的建议，提高了设备利用率。青岛工学院在北京某工程公司建筑工地实习的土木系学生协助工人超额完成了生产任务，提高了工人劳动生产率。哈尔滨工业大学在第一汽车制造厂工地各工区实习的四年级学生，在施工技术与现场管理方面提出了四十一条合理化建议，其中十五条被采纳，十一条可以采纳。天津大学工业与民用建筑结构专业的学生严士超在第一汽车制造厂工地担任瓦工工长助手时，提出了有关雨季施工和砌墙板等十七项合理化建议。武汉大学水利学院水利技术建筑专修科在南湾水库实习的学生，研究了土壤含水量问题，提出了挖土、碎土、堆土、运土、填筑土坝各种工作之间的合理配合操作的意见，使填筑土坝的土壤达到标准含水量，为生产部门节省了大量的工时和费用。　（新华社）
