Among those who voted were labor models who had met Chairman Mao, young people who had just turned eighteen, writers and famous actors, and mothers with many children. Guo Shude, a national railway labor model and former driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive, attended the meeting today wearing a neat railway worker's uniform. Guo Shude had met Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao had traveled on the train he drove. Today, with boundless love for the leader, he elected Mao Zedong. Mr. Hua Nan Gui, a 78-year-old member and chief engineer of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Urban Planning Committee, was the oldest representative present. He remembered that Chairman Mao had called on the people of the capital to work hard to build the capital well at the first Beijing Municipal People's Congress in 1949. Hua Nan Gui said: After these years of efforts, this ancient city has been completely renewed. The old man said excitedly: Chairman Mao led the Chinese revolution to success, and with Chairman Mao's leadership, the construction of a socialist society will surely be successful. Hua Nan Gui also voted for Chairman Mao. Tian Fugui, director of the Women's Federation in the jurisdiction of Wei Ying Hutong Police Station, was so excited when she heard about the election that she didn't sleep all night. She got up at 5:30 on the 21st and was the first to enter the venue. She said: I came early just to vote for Chairman Mao.

During the election, Bai Yintai, director of teaching affairs at the Central Institute for Nationalities Affiliated Middle School and a Mongolian representative, braved illness to attend the congress to vote for Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people.

The voting ended at 10:30. The result of counting the ballots showed that none of the 539 representatives abstained.

At 3 p.m., the election results were announced. Comrade Mao Zedong was elected as a deputy to the National People's Congress with 100% of the votes.
