August 18th morning.

The first session of the First People's Congress of Shandong Province began to discuss the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China.

Amidst warm applause, the seventeenth person to step onto the podium to speak was a simple and robust farmer in his fifties. He was Zhang Benzhou, the father of Zhang Jihui, an air force hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

"The draft constitution says that all our people across the country should take the bright road of socialism; the major affairs of the country should be handed over to all the people to manage themselves. This is a happy event for all the people," Zhang Benzhou said excitedly:

	"Over the past few years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our farmers have been liberated, land has been distributed, and our living standards have been rising day by day. However, it is not enough to be satisfied with these. We must also listen to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao: take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. The people elected us as representatives to do good things for everyone. Therefore, we must actively lead the farmers to take this road, produce more grain, and at the same time sell more grain to the state to support the country's socialist construction and consolidate our national defense. Not only should our generation live well, but also our children and grandchildren, generation after generation, should enjoy this happiness."

Zhang Benzhou continued: "Comrade Xu Jianchun, who spoke just now, is still a young woman under twenty years old, but she has led everyone to organize agricultural production cooperatives and made great achievements. This is what we should learn from her. Although I am over half my life, my spirit is still very good. I want to compete with this young woman on the bright road of building a socialist society."

Thunderous applause shook the entire venue. The representatives expressed their respect for this energetic and forever forward-looking old man.

"The people of the whole country are concerned about our Chinese territory of Taiwan."

Zhang Benzhou said indignantly: "The evil creature Chiang Kai-shek is still entrenched there, and the people of Taiwan are suffering; if this scourge is not eradicated, we cannot build well and cannot get peace. The Central People's Government calls on us to fight for the liberation of Taiwan, and now we must take on this glorious task. Our heroic People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country must liberate Taiwan, and we will never give up until Taiwan is taken! We must write more letters to the People's Liberation Army comrades to encourage them to train well and prepare for the recovery of Taiwan. We must also step up preparations in the rear and actively support them."

The words of the air force hero's father touched the heartstrings of every representative, and warm applause resounded in the venue once again; his words not only expressed the wishes of all the representatives, but also showed the common demands and will of the 48 million people of Shandong.

Zhang Benzhou lives in Qiaoshang Village, Shidao County, on the east coast of the Shandong Peninsula. He said that before he came to attend the meeting, the farmers in this village were about to bring out the energy they used to support the People's Liberation Army during the Huaihai Campaign.

    一位英雄的父亲的话
    新华社记者　孙恩成　台旭
    八月十八日上午。
    山东省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议开始讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    在热烈的掌声中，第十七个走上主席台发言的，是一位五十多岁的朴实健壮的农民，他就是中国人民志愿军空军英雄张积慧的父亲张本周。
    “宪法草案上写着：咱们全国人民要走社会主义的光明大道；国家的大事要交给全体人民自己去管理，这是全国人民的喜事。”张本周兴奋地说道：
  “过去几年来，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，咱们农民翻了身，分了土地，生活水平一天天地上升。但是，光满足这些还不行。咱们还必须听共产党和毛主席的话：走互助合作的道路。人民选咱们当代表，就是让咱们为大家办好事。因此，咱们要积极带动农民，走这条道路，多打粮食，同时多卖粮食给国家，支援国家的社会主义建设，巩固咱们的国防。不但咱们这一辈要生活得好，还要使儿孙后代、辈辈世世享受这个幸福。”
    张本周接着说：“刚才讲话的徐建春同志，她还是一个不满二十岁的青年，可是她领导大家组织了农业生产合作社，做出了很大的成绩，这是咱们应该向她学习的。我虽然年过半辈，精神还很好，我要和这位青年在建设社会主义社会的光明大道上竞赛。”
    雷般的掌声震动了整个会场。代表们都为这位精力充沛而永远向前的老人表示敬意。
    “全国人民都关心着咱们中国的领土台湾。”
    张本周激愤地说下去：“蒋介石这个毒孽还盘踞在那里，台湾的人民正在受难；不拔除这个祸根，咱们就不能好好地建设，就得不到安宁。中央人民政府号召咱们要为解放台湾而奋斗，现在咱们要把这个光荣的任务担当起来。咱们英勇的人民解放军和全国人民一定要解放台湾，不打下台湾，誓不罢休！咱们要多多地写信给解放军同志，鼓励他们好好地锻炼，作好收复台湾的一切准备。咱们在后面也要加紧准备，积极支援他们。”
    这位空军英雄的父亲的话，打动了每个代表的心弦，会场上再一次地响起了热烈的掌声；他的话不仅说出了全体代表的心愿，而且显现出全山东四千八百万人民的共同要求和意志。
    张本周家住在山东半岛东海岸的石岛县桥上村。他说，在他来参加会议以前，这个村里的农民们又要把在淮海战役中支援人民解放军的那股劲头拿出来了。
