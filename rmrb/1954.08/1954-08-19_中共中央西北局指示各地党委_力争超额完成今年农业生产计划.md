    Editor's Note: Striving to fulfill this year's agricultural production plan is the primary task for rural workers and the broad masses of farmers in all regions. To this end, this newspaper published an editorial on August 8, pointing out the need to quickly adopt active and effective measures to combat rain, flooding, and flood disasters, and to continuously struggle to complete replanting and increased production plans. During this year's flood season, some areas in the Yangtze River and Huai River basins experienced heavy rainfall and flooding, resulting in significant damage. In recent months, local Party committees have issued resolutions or instructions to support industrial construction and disaster-stricken areas, calling on the broad masses of farmers to strive to overfulfill this year's agricultural production increase plan. Here, we publish the instruction issued by the CPC Central Committee Northwest Bureau on August 10, which calls on Party committees at all levels to immediately organize cadres, mobilize rural Party and League members, rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and strive to overfulfill the agricultural production plan. The methods mentioned in this instruction can be used for reference by other regions.

    This year, most areas in the Northwest achieved a bumper harvest of winter and spring wheat, with a total output of 8.1 billion jin, an increase of 1.1 billion jin compared to last year, exceeding the original planned output by more than 690 million jin. More than 70 million mu of autumn fields are generally growing well, and there is also hope for a bumper harvest. This is a favorable aspect of completing this year's production plan. However, it is still necessary to prevent and correct any blind optimism and slackening in cadres and the masses, and make them clearly recognize the current unfavorable factors. This year, the total autumn field sowing area in the region has decreased compared to last year. Grain in Shaanxi decreased by 12 percent, and corn decreased by nearly 5 percent. In Xinjiang, only 74 percent of the planned planting area for autumn fields has been completed. Currently, autumn fields in some areas have been attacked by floods, hail, insect pests, and other disasters, which may lead to reduced production. At the same time, after the summer harvest, some places have relaxed their leadership over mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and many mutual aid teams have disbanded. In Hancheng and Heyang in Shaanxi, 20 to 30 percent of the mutual aid teams have disbanded. Agricultural production cooperatives have widespread problems such as poor organization of labor, resulting in idleness and absenteeism, and some cooperatives even face the danger of collapse. If these objective difficulties and shortcomings in the work are ignored, the autumn fields, which account for 60 percent of the cultivated land area, will suffer reduced production, affecting the completion of the annual production plan. In addition, floods in the Jianghuai region have caused losses in some areas, which have a negative impact on the completion of the national production plan. The central government requires non-disaster areas across the country to overfulfill the agricultural production increase task in order to compensate for the reduced production in disaster areas. This is a very arduous and urgent task, and Party committees at all levels should conscientiously implement it. To this end, Party committees at all levels should immediately organize cadres, mobilize rural Party and League members, rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and lead all farmers to do the following:

    I.  Grasp the weeding of autumn fields, prevent rice lodging, and carry out "artificial pollination" of corn. Cotton should be pruned and topped in a timely manner. Fertilize autumn fields as much as possible where topdressing is still feasible. Continue to prevent and control pests in autumn fields and cotton fields. Supply and marketing cooperatives should promptly allocate insecticides and fertilizers to supply farmers. Agricultural technology guidance agencies should seize the main links of increasing production at the current time, and help and guide farmers to improve production technology. Mountainous areas should carry out hunting and field protection campaigns to reduce losses from animal pests.

    II. Since the beginning of summer, there has been more rain, and mountain floods have broken out in a few areas, causing riverbanks to collapse and creating disasters. In these areas, disaster relief and production should be regarded as the central task, and all forces should be concentrated on rescue, drainage, and replanting. There may be more continuous rain in the autumn, so more attention should be paid to flood and waterlogging prevention. Along both sides of rivers and in low-lying areas, embankments should be built, levees should be built, and drainage ditches should be dug. Medium-sized and large-scale flood prevention and drainage projects included in the plan should be completed as soon as possible to achieve "prevention is better than cure." However, most of the Northwest is arid, so don't relax drought prevention work just because of a temporary increase in rain. There are currently more than 35 million mu of irrigated land in the region, and attention should be paid to timely irrigation. The plan to build agricultural irrigation projects this year must be carefully checked to ensure that it is fully completed. This is an important condition for guaranteeing increased production.

    III. Doing a good job in preparing for autumn sowing is also one of the main tasks at present. Winter wheat areas have had bumper harvests for many years, and soil fertility has been greatly depleted. Fertilizer is generally lacking this year, so doing a good job in deep plowing and applying base fertilizer is particularly important. Areas where wheat fields have not yet been deep-plowed should give full play to the role of mutual aid and cooperation organizations to solve the difficulties of lacking draught animals and strive to achieve deep plowing once. Strip sowing has been successful in its promotion, and should be promoted as much as possible in Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other places where promotion is not yet widespread, and technology should be further improved in Shaanxi and other places where promotion is already established. Supply and marketing cooperatives should organize small handicraft workers to help farmers modify old seeders and supply new seeders. Before autumn sowing, counties, districts, and townships should summarize the experience of high-yielding in previous years and widely carry out autumn sowing technology training. In addition, the work of allocating high-quality varieties and insect-resistant varieties must also be prepared early.

    IV. Party committees at all levels below the prefectural committee must resolutely and quickly shift the focus of leadership to the agricultural production increase campaign centered on mutual aid and cooperation, in accordance with the spirit of the central government's instructions. Facts have proved that the increased production of mutual aid and cooperation organizations is very significant. According to statistics from 18 agricultural production cooperatives in Dali and other four counties in Shaanxi, wheat production this year is more than 25 percent higher than that of local people; seven cooperatives in Dali are more than 32 percent higher than that of local people; the Jiaojiazhuang agricultural cooperative in Gansu increased production by more than 160 percent in two years; and the output of many mutual aid teams in various places is generally about 10 percent higher than that of local people. However, the leadership level of many county party committees is far behind the objective situation of the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Some county party secretaries have never specifically led the work of running cooperatives, and even bypass cooperatives when they go to the countryside. Some district committees and township branches do not care about agricultural cooperatives, so the phenomenon of laissez-faire in the mutual aid and cooperation movement is still quite serious. If this situation is not changed quickly, it will miss the opportunity and cause serious mistakes, and agricultural production will not be able to keep up with the needs of national industrialization. To this end, the Northwest Bureau requires party committees in all regions to be very vigilant, change the general style of leadership, and properly arrange the overall work of each period. Party committees below the prefectural committee must resolutely implement the leadership of the agricultural production increase campaign centered on mutual aid and cooperation with more than 90 percent of their strength. The provincial and prefectural committees are responsible for checking the work of their subordinate county committees before the autumn harvest, specifically educating and helping them to truly value the agricultural production increase campaign centered on mutual aid and cooperation, and putting forward specific methods to promote it based on the local actual situation, in order to overfulfill this year's production plan.

    中共中央西北局指示各地党委
    力争超额完成今年农业生产计划
    编者按：力争完成今年农业生产计划，是各地农村工作者和广大农民当前的主要任务。为此，本报曾在八月八日发表社论，指出必须迅速采取积极有效的措施，战胜雨涝和洪水灾害，为完成补种和增产计划而作不断的斗争。今年汛期，长江、淮河流域等局部地区雨水较多，洪水为害，因而汛情严重，这些地区已受到损失。近月以来，各地党委为支援工业建设和遭受灾害的地区，已先后发布决议或指示，号召广大农民努力争取超额完成今年农业增产计划。在这里我们发表中共中央西北局八月十日发出的指示，它号召各级党委立即组织干部力量，动员农村党员、团员，依靠互助合作组织，争取超额完成农业生产计划。这个指示中所提办法可供各地参考。    
    今年，西北大部地区的冬、春小麦获得丰收，总产量达八十一亿斤，比去年增加十一亿斤，超过原计划产量六亿九千多万斤。七千多万亩秋田，一般生长良好，亦有丰收希望。这是完成今年生产计划的有利方面。但还必须预防和纠正干部、群众中的任何盲目乐观和松劲情绪，使他们清楚地认识到目前存在的不利因素。今年全区秋田播种面积比去年有所减少，陕西谷子减少百分之十二，玉米减少近百分之五；新疆秋田只完成计划种植面积的百分之七十四。目前，部分地区的秋田又遭洪水、雹雨、虫害等侵袭，可能要减产。同时，夏收之后，有些地方放松对互助合作组织的领导，不少互助组已经散伙。陕西韩城、郃阳等地的互助组散伙的达百分之二、三十，农业生产合作社相当普遍地存在着劳动力组织不善，发生窝工、旷工现象，个别社甚至有垮台的危险。如果忽视这些客观困难和工作中的缺点，将使占耕地面积百分之六十的秋田减产，影响全年生产计划的完成。加之，江淮洪水在一些地区造成损失，对全国生产计划的完成发生不利影响，中央要求全国非灾区超额完成农业增产任务，以弥补灾区减产损失。这是一项十分艰巨而又紧迫的任务，请各级党委认真贯彻执行。为此，各级党委应立即组织干部力量，动员农村党、团员，依靠互助合作组织，带动全体农民，做好以下几项工作：
    一、抓紧进行秋田锄草，防止水稻倒伏，进行玉米“人工授粉”。对棉花应适时整枝打卡。秋田还能增施追肥者，尽量扩大追肥面积。继续防治秋田、棉田虫害。供销合作部门应及时调拨防虫药械和化肥、植肥等供应农民。农业技术指导机关应抓住当前增产的主要环节，帮助指导农民提高生产技术。山区应开展打猎护田运动，减少兽害损失。
    二、入夏以来，雨水较多，少数地区山洪暴发，河堤溃决成灾。这些地区，应把救灾生产当成中心工作，集中一切力量进行抢救、排水、复种等工作。秋季霪雨可能增多，更要注意防洪防涝。凡河流两岸和地势低洼地带，均应培修堤坝、打埝、挖排水沟；列入计划的中型以上防洪、排洪工程，力争早日竣工，做到“防患未然”。但西北多系干旱地区，不要因一时雨多而放松防旱工作。全区现有三千五百余万亩的水地，应注意适时灌溉；今年兴修农田水利的计划，须认真检查一次，做到全部完成。这是保证增产的一个重要条件。
    三、做好秋播准备工作，也是目前主要工作之一。大部冬麦地区，连年丰收，地力消耗甚大，而今年肥料又普遍缺乏，做好深耕和增施基肥就显得特别重要。目前，麦地还未进行深耕者，应充分发挥互助合作组织的作用，解决耕畜缺乏的困难，争取做到深耕一次。条播推广已获成效，在推广还不普遍的甘肃、青海、新疆等地应尽力推行，推广已有基础的陕西等地应进一步提高技术。供销合作部门应组织小手工业者，帮助农民改装旧耧和供应新耧。秋播前，县、区、乡都应总结历年丰产经验，广泛进行秋播技术传授工作。此外，对调配优良品种和抗虫品种的工作亦须提早作好。
    四、地委以下各级党委务须遵照中央指示精神，坚决而迅速地将领导重心转移到以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动方面来。事实证明：互助合作组织的增产是很显著的，据陕西大荔等四县十八个农业生产合作社的统计，今年小麦产量高出当地群众的百分之二十五以上；大荔七个社则高出当地群众的百分之三十二还多；甘肃焦家庄农业社两年即增产百分之一百六十多；各地许多互助组的产量比当地群众一般高出百分之十左右。但目前很多县委的领导水平则远远赶不上群众互助合作运动发展的客观形势，有的县委书记从未具体领导过办社工作，甚至下乡还要绕过合作社；有的区委会和乡支部不管农业社，故互助合作运动中的放任自流现象仍相当严重。这种情况，如不迅速改变就要贻误时机，造成严重错误，农业生产就无法赶上国家工业化发展的需要。为此，西北局要求各地党委，必须十分警惕，扭转一般化的领导作风，妥当安排每一时期的全盘工作；地委以下的党委，必须坚决贯彻以百分之九十以上的力量领导以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。并责成各省委、地委，在秋收以前，检查一次所属县委的工作，具体教育帮助他们切实重视以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，根据当地实际情况提出具体办法去推行，以便超额完成今年的生产计划。
