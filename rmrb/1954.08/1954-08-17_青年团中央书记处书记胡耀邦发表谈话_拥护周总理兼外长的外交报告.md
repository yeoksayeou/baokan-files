    Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Speaks Out in Support of Premier Zhou's Foreign Policy Report
    Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, issued a statement supporting the foreign policy report made by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. The full text is as follows:
    Premier Zhou's foreign policy report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee and the resolution approved by the meeting represent the will of the people and fully express our country's fundamental foreign policy at present. All members of the Communist Youth League and youth in China will strive to realize all the policies put forward in this report and resolution.
    The Chinese delegation, headed by Premier Zhou, has consistently pursued our country's peaceful foreign policy at the Geneva Conference, making important contributions to world peace and adding favorable conditions for our country's socialist construction. This is a glorious page in our diplomatic history and unfolds a promising vision of successive victories for our peaceful foreign policy.
    Undoubtedly, the great diplomatic achievements made by our delegation are another major victory for the Chinese people under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, following the overthrow of the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique.
    However, the American aggressor group is not only unwilling to accept defeat but is intensifying its hostility towards the Chinese people. It is massively strengthening the military equipment of the Chiang bandit gang, plotting to conclude a so-called "bilateral common security treaty," and actively supporting this traitorous group in conducting harassment and destructive warfare against our mainland and coastal areas, in order to expand armed intervention and attempt to move this stinking Chiang Kai-shek corpse back to the Chinese mainland, thereby undermining Asian peace and creating a new world war. Chinese youth, with a glorious tradition of patriotism, will never allow the territorial sovereignty of their motherland to be incomplete, nor will they allow their elders and siblings to be trampled by the hooves of beasts. Chinese youth vow to stand at their posts, intensify work, intensify production, intensify study, and be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland, to contribute all their strength to liberate the sacred territory of the motherland—Taiwan, and to defend Asian and world peace.

    青年团中央书记处书记胡耀邦发表谈话
    拥护周总理兼外长的外交报告
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记胡耀邦发表谈话，拥护周恩来总理兼外交部部长的外交报告。全文如下：
    周总理在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上所作的外交报告和会议所批准的决议，代表全国人民的意志，充分地表达了我国当前外交的根本方针。全中国的青年团员和青年，必将为实现这个报告和决议所提出的全部方针而奋斗到底。
    以周总理为首的我国代表团，在日内瓦会议上坚持不懈地奉行我国的和平外交政策，已经为世界和平作出了重要的贡献，为我国社会主义建设增加了有利的条件，这是我国外交史上辉煌的一页，并展开了我国和平外交政策节节胜利的远景。
    毫无疑义，我国代表团所取得的外交上的巨大成就，是我国人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席领导下，继打倒蒋介石卖国贼集团之后又一次重大的胜利。
    但是，美国侵略集团不仅不甘心失败，反而加紧与我国人民为敌。它正在大量地加强对蒋匪帮的军事装备，策划订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”，积极支持这个卖国集团对我国大陆和沿海进行骚扰和破坏性的战争，以扩大武装干涉，妄图把这具臭气冲天的蒋介石僵尸搬回中国大陆来，并从而破坏亚洲和平和制造新的世界战争。具有光荣爱国主义传统的中国青年，决不允许自己祖国的领土主权残缺不全，决不允许自己的父老和兄弟姊妹被兽蹄践踏。中国青年发誓站住自己的岗位，加紧工作，加紧生产，加紧学习，随时准备响应祖国的召唤，为解放祖国的神圣领土——台湾，和保卫亚洲和世界和平，贡献出全部力量。
