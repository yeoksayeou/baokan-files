    Our Great Motherland
    The Ya'an Bridge, the longest modern highway bridge in Xikang Province, spanning the Qiang River, has officially opened to traffic. The opening of the Ya'an Bridge has created conditions for direct intermodal transportation on the Sichuan-Kang Highway and the Ya'an to Huili section of the Kang-Dian Highway, greatly accelerating the commodity turnover rate, and will further promote the exchange of goods between the Xichang and Ya'an regions and various places outside the province.
