    Children's Newspaper
    Mei Qing
    The China Children's Daily has a wide influence and high prestige among the children of the whole country. The children affectionately call it "an intimate teacher and friend." When the China Children's Daily calls for something to be done, or points out something that should not be done, the children always respond immediately or correct their shortcomings in a timely manner. Therefore, teachers, counselors, and parents regard it as a powerful assistant. For example, not long ago, the newspaper pointed out the disadvantages of playing marbles. Many teachers wrote to the newspaper saying that many children in their schools used to love playing marbles, and sometimes even gambled with marbles. After reading the China Children's Daily, they realized the disadvantages of playing marbles and stopped playing them voluntarily. Some children even exchanged their marbles for stationery and entrusted the newspaper to send them to Korean children. This spring, the China Children's Daily called for planting sunflowers, and students in many elementary schools across the country planted sunflowers under the guidance of their teachers.
    Opening the newspaper, children immediately come into contact with the thriving construction life of the motherland. The China Children's Daily mainly conducts patriotic education for children by reporting on the construction achievements of the motherland in various fields. It correctly grasps the characteristics and acceptance abilities of children, and uses various forms such as fairy tales, stories, poems, comics, and cartoons to carry out this education in a simple and easy-to-understand way. For example, when educating about the general task of the country during the transition period, stories were used such as car and horse races, tractor and old cow competitions in plowing, and carpenters using electric saws and carpenters using handsaws competing in sawing wood. These stories were accompanied by interesting illustrations, vividly illustrating the benefits of industrialization. The large painting "With Heavy Industry, Everything Can Be Made" drawn by cartoonist Mi Gu for the children clearly shows heavy industry factories manufacturing thousands of various machines, tanks, cars, airplanes, ships..., so that children can understand the meaning of industrialization at a glance and leave a deep impression. The fairy tales written by the young reporter "Flying All Over" about major events at home and abroad have been welcomed by the majority of children.
    Labor education is an important part of communist moral education. In addition to paying attention to daily labor education, the China Children's Daily has recently focused on labor education and socialist future education for graduating senior elementary school students engaging in labor production. In its reports, it has overcome the shortcomings of simply introducing the happy prospects of socialism in the past and one-sidedly emphasizing the establishment of children's personal lofty ideals. It tries to connect the ideals and lives of children, as well as how to develop good labor habits from an early age. Many stories, poems, and pictures are permeated with the idea of ​​labor being glorious and using hard work to build the motherland. The newspaper launched a discussion on labor production, which was welcomed by the majority of children and teachers. The newspaper received more than 2,700 letters from groups and individuals participating in the discussion, including letters from the remote Great Northern Wilderness, the Inner Mongolia grasslands, and the Northwest frontier. This discussion corrected many children's understanding of the issues of further education and engaging in labor production, and encouraged their confidence and determination to dedicate themselves to the construction of the great motherland through diligent labor.
    Children can learn about major international events from the China Children's Daily. They read frequently published reports on the lives of international children with great interest and receive vivid internationalist education. The happy lives of children in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries are very dear to our country's children; they read with admiration the stories of Vietnamese and Korean children bravely participating in the struggle; the tragic lives of children in capitalist and colonial countries arouse deep sympathy and concern among our country's children. The poem "Poem Sent to Toms River" movingly describes the persecution of the Rosenberg's children after their parents were killed by the American reactionary government. After reading it, the children were very moved and wrote to the newspaper, demanding to protest against the barbarous acts of American imperialism and asking to bring the persecuted brothers to China; some saved their pocket money to buy things to send to these two children.
    Children are very sensitive to everything in the objective world. They like to pursue the reasons for changes in things and crave knowledge. The China Children's Daily introduces many interesting and fresh knowledge according to children's level of understanding and acceptance ability to meet this requirement of children. The columns "Dr. Brain Teaser", "Small Scientific Experiments", and "Think, Why?" that often meet with readers are the most popular among children. Some children followed the production methods introduced in the newspaper to make microscopes, airplane models, etc., and gave them to the newspaper as gifts. Articles introducing new scientific inventions (such as glass wool, ice houses, colored wood) and the recently published poem "Entering the Atomic Energy Age" have all encouraged children to love science and learn scientific knowledge. After reading articles such as "The Letter from the Mask" and "What Two Glasses of Water Said," which introduce health and hygiene knowledge, many children corrected their bad habits. In coordination with labor education, in recent period the newspaper has continuously introduced knowledge of industrial and agricultural production and knowledge of weather changes, such as: "Soil - the factory that makes plants," "Three Moms of Crops - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium," "From Cotton to Cloth," and so on. These short and very interesting articles explain the principle that labor requires knowledge.
    The China Children's Daily often introduces the works of our country's writers for children to child readers. The names of writers such as Zhang Tianyi, Feng Xuefeng, Jin Jin, He Yi, Zuo Lin, Gao Shiqi, and Dong Junlun are not only familiar to young readers, but also intimate. Works with profound educational significance such as "The Story of Luo Wenyin," "They and Us," "Lu Xun and His Childhood Friends," and "The Story of Dong Cunrui" are cultivating the new moral qualities of children. In addition, the newspaper publishes hero and model stories in almost every issue. These works have an inestimable impact on the formation of the qualities of our generation of socialist new people.
    As the team newspaper of the China Young Pioneers, the China Children's Daily also frequently guides the work of the team and conducts education on loving learning, loving the organization, and the collective. Every winter and summer vacation, it always puts forward suggestions for spending a good holiday life in a timely manner to help children have a happy and meaningful holiday.
    Maintaining close contact with young readers is a fine tradition of the China Children's Daily. It cares about the lives of children like a dear teacher and friend, and it reflects their demands and wishes. For example, when it was discovered that many Young Pioneers and activists had too many concurrent jobs, and some schools allowed children to participate in too many social activities, which affected their studies and health, the China Children's Daily immediately criticized this phenomenon and published a commentary. The struggle of the China Children's Daily to care for the interests of children and against phenomena that endanger children's physical and mental health has been supported by the majority of children, teachers, and parents. The criticized schools conducted self-examinations. The children happily said: "The China Children's Daily is really our own newspaper!" The China Children's Daily receives an average of about 10,000 contributions, letters, and other submissions from readers every month. In addition to contributions, an average of about 200 letters and gifts entrusted to be forwarded to Chairman Mao, the Volunteers, and international children are received each month, with a maximum of more than 600; entrusting the purchase of books, newspapers, stationery, and daily necessities is even more common; there are also requests for help due to illness, and entrusting the search for fathers, brothers, and other relatives. Last year, a child named Huang Xunwu from Taohua Township, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, wrote to the newspaper, asking them to find his father, Huang Hejun, who had been away from home for more than three years and had no news. The letter only stated one thing about his father: three years ago, his father worked at the Ziqiang Bookstore in Beijing. The China Children's Daily tried various methods, contacted the district government, police station, etc., and finally found Huang Hejun, so that the father and son, who had not been in contact for more than three years, regained contact.
    The China Children's Daily is the most widely distributed and influential children's newspaper in our country. Its current circulation is more than 1.74 million copies. Undoubtedly, it has become a very powerful tool for educating children. Precisely because of this, we also have higher requirements for it. At present, the coverage of the China Children's Daily is not broad enough. For example, reports reflecting the lives of rural children are relatively few, and the work of specifically guiding the study and life of rural children according to rural characteristics is very little; the content of articles introducing scientific knowledge is not rich enough, and the form is not lively enough; sometimes, the newspaper does not do enough in closely linking children's thinking and real life. In terms of form, the drawing style is relatively monotonous, and sometimes the ideological content of the drawings is not clear enough; some articles are too long and written too stiffly and boringly. These shortcomings need to be improved. We hope and believe that the China Children's Daily will be better run with the care and concern of the majority of readers, so that it can better play its huge educational role.

    孩子们的报纸
    梅青
    中国少年报在全国少年儿童中有着广泛的影响和很高的威信。孩子们都亲切地称它为“亲密的老师和朋友”。中国少年报号召做什么，或者指出什么事情不应该做时，孩子们总是立刻响应或及时纠正缺点的，因此，教师、辅导员和家长都把它当作有力的助手。举例说，不久以前，报上指出了弹玻璃球的坏处，许多教师写信给报社说：他们学校许多孩子原先都爱弹玻璃球，有时还拿弹玻璃球来赌博，看了中国少年报，知道弹玻璃球的坏处，就自动不弹了。有些孩子还把玻璃球换成文具，托报社转送给朝鲜小朋友。今年春季，中国少年报号召种向日葵，全国许多小学校的同学在教师指导下种植了向日葵。
    打开报纸，孩子们立刻就接触到蓬蓬勃勃的祖国建设生活。中国少年报主要是通过报道祖国各方面的建设成就，来向少年儿童进行爱国主义教育的。它正确地掌握儿童的特点和接受能力，运用童话、故事、诗歌、漫画、卡通画等多种多样的形式，深入浅出地进行这种教育。例如：在进行国家在过渡时期的总任务的教育的时候，采用了汽车和马车赛跑，拖拉机和老牛比赛耕地，使用电锯的木匠和使用拉锯的木匠比赛锯木等故事体裁，配上有趣的插图，形象地说明了工业化的好处。漫画家米谷为孩子们画的“有了重工业就能制造一切”的大幅画，清晰明确地表现了重工业工厂制造出成千上万的各种机器、坦克、汽车、飞机、轮船……，少年儿童们一看就能明白工业化的意义，并且留下极深的印象。小记者“满天飞”游历各地所写的报道国内外大事的童话故事，受到了广大少年儿童的欢迎。
    劳动教育是共产主义道德教育的重要部分。中国少年报除了注意日常的劳动教育外，并在最近一个时期，就高小毕业生从事劳动生产问题，较为集中地进行了劳动教育和社会主义前途教育。它在报道中克服了过去单纯地介绍社会主义幸福远景和片面地强调树立少年儿童个人远大理想的缺点，尽量使少年儿童把理想和生活，以及如何从小养成良好的劳动习惯联系起来。许多故事、诗歌和图画贯穿着劳动光荣和用辛勤的劳动建设祖国的思想。报上发起了关于劳动生产的讨论，受到广大少年儿童和教师的欢迎。报社收到参加讨论的集体和个人的来信有二千七百多件，其中有从遥远的北大荒、内蒙古草原以及西北边疆的来信。这种讨论，端正了许多孩子对于升学和从事劳动生产问题的认识，鼓励了他们准备以勤奋的劳动献身于伟大祖国的建设事业的信心和决心。
    少年儿童们可以从中国少年报知道国际间发生的重大事件。他们怀着浓厚的兴趣阅读经常登载的介绍国际儿童生活的通讯，受到生动的国际主义教育。苏联和各人民民主国家儿童的幸福生活，对于我国少年儿童们是十分亲切的；他们怀着崇敬的心情阅读在战斗中的越南以及朝鲜儿童英勇地参加斗争的故事；资本主义国家和殖民地国家儿童的悲惨生活引起我国儿童深切的同情和关怀。诗歌“寄到汤姆斯河去的诗”，动人地描述了罗森堡夫妇被美国反动政府杀害后，他们的孩子又遭迫害的情景，孩子们读了以后很受感动，纷纷写信给报社，要求抗议美帝国主义的残暴行为，并要求把受迫害的兄弟接到中国来；有的省下零用钱买东西送给这两位小朋友。
    少年儿童对于客观世界的一切事物都是很敏感的，他们喜欢追求事物变化的原因，渴求知识。中国少年报根据儿童的认识水平和接受能力，介绍许多有趣和新鲜的知识，来满足孩子们的这种要求。常常和读者见面的“动脑筋博士”、“科学小实验”、“想一想为什么？”等专栏是最受儿童欢迎的。有些孩子照着报上介绍的制作方法，做成了显微镜、飞机模型等，并把它们作为礼物送给报社。介绍科学上新发明（如玻璃棉、冰房子、彩色的木料）的文章以及最近发表的“走进原子能时代”的诗歌，都鼓舞了孩子们热爱科学和学习科学知识的热情。许多孩子读了介绍健康卫生知识的“口罩的来信”
  “两杯水讲的话”等文章以后，改正了不好的习惯。配合劳动教育，最近一个时期又连续地介绍了工农业生产方面的知识和天气变化方面的知识，如：“土壤——制造植物的工厂”、“庄稼的三个妈妈——氮、磷、钾”、“从棉花到布”等，这些简短的、读起来十分有趣的文章，说明了劳动需要知识的道理。
    中国少年报常常把我国作家为孩子们的创作介绍给儿童读者。张天翼、冯雪峰、金近、贺宜、左林、高士其、董均伦等作家的名字，对于小读者们不仅是熟悉的，而且是亲热的。“罗文应的故事”、
  “他们和我们”、“鲁迅和他少年时候的朋友”、
  “董存瑞的故事”等有着深刻教育意义的作品，培养着孩子们的新的道德品质。此外，报纸几乎每期都有英雄模范故事，这些作品对于我们这一代的社会主义新人的品质的形成，有着难以估价的影响。
    作为中国少年先锋队的队报，中国少年报还经常指导队的工作，进行热爱学习、热爱组织和集体的教育。每到寒暑假，它总是及时提出过好假期生活的意见，以帮助儿童过个愉快而有意义的假期。
    和小读者们保持密切的联系，是中国少年报的优良传统。它像亲爱的老师和朋友一样关心着少年儿童们的生活，它反映着他们的要求和愿望。例如，当发现许多少先队员和积极分子兼职过多，某些学校让儿童参加过多的社会活动，以致影响了他们的学业和健康的时候，中国少年报马上对这种现象展开了批评，并且发表了评论。中国少年报这种关心儿童利益，和危害儿童身心健康的现象进行的斗争，受到广大少年儿童和教师、家长的拥护。被批评的学校进行了检讨。孩子们高兴地说：“中国少年报真是咱们自己的报纸！”中国少年报平均每月收到读者们的来稿、来信和其他各种来件约在一万件左右，除了稿件以外，委托代转给毛主席、志愿军和国际小朋友的信件和礼物平均每月有两百件左右，最高达到六百多件；委托代购书报、文具和日用品等更是常事；还有因生病要求帮助的，委托代找父亲、哥哥等亲人的。去年，湖南湘阴县桃花乡有个叫黄训武的小朋友，写信给报社，请他们代找他的离家三年多、渺无音讯的爸爸黄和钧。关于他爸爸的情况，信上只说明了一点：三年前，他爸爸在北京自强书局工作。中国少年报社多方设法，和区政府、派出所等联系，最后终于找到了黄和钧，使三年多不通音讯的父子又取得了联系。
    中国少年报是我国少年儿童报刊中发行最广影响最大的一份报纸，它现在的发行额是一百七十四万多份。无疑地，它已成为对少年儿童进行教育的极有力的工具。正因为如此，我们对它也有着更高的要求。目前，中国少年报的报道面还不够广，例如，反映农村儿童生活的报道就比较少，根据农村特点具体指导农村少年儿童的学习和生活的工作作得很少；介绍科学知识的文章，内容还不够丰富，形式不够活泼；有些时候，报纸在密切联系儿童思想和生活实际方面，还作得很不够。从形式上说，图画风格较单一，有时图画的思想性不够明确；有些文章太长，而且写得较生硬枯燥。这些缺点是需要改进的。我们希望，而且相信中国少年报在广大读者的爱护和关怀下，会办得更好的，从而能更好地发挥它的巨大的教育作用。
