To Comrades Li Shouyan, Wen Qiyuan, and He Kaixian of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army:

We have been apart for a long time, and as I pick up my pen, I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin. But I know that you are eager to know the news of the motherland's economic construction. Now, let me tell you a little about Fushun, the "coal capital," which is undergoing "overall transformation" according to socialist requirements! Comrades, speaking of which, the mining of the Fushun coal district has a history of more than 100 years, and its reserves of raw coal are among the largest in the world, with a coal seam as thick as 120 meters. Therefore, some people call it "Thousand Gold Village." But what was this "Thousand Gold Village" like during the Japanese rule? Please look at this folk song that was circulating at that time: "Once you arrive at Thousand Gold Village, you have to sell your bedding; new ones are exchanged for old ones, and old ones are exchanged for sacks." These limited words contain endless suffering; how many of our working brothers suffered here! And what about the coal mine itself? Due to the Japanese imperialists' "kill the chicken to get the eggs" method of mining, coupled with the massive destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, it was already scarred and battered at the time of liberation.

But, friends, our Party knows that coal is the real food of industry, "Without this food, industry has nowhere to use it." (Lenin: "Speech at the First All-Russian Congress of Representatives of Miners' Unions") Therefore, shortly after liberation, recovery work began here, and its appearance was changed in a very short period of time. The raw coal mined by the workers from underground is transported to various places to supply the needs of national industry and daily use; coking coal is also transported to Anshan Iron and Steel Company for steelmaking. In addition, the oil shale produced here provides a very rich raw material for kerosene for synthetic petroleum. However, what has been mined in the past is only a part of its entire coal seam, and most of the rest is still buried underground. To extract all of this coal, in addition to tapping the potential of existing mines, it is also necessary to improve equipment and transform certain mines in a planned way. Because some of the equipment is outdated, and the location of some of the mines is not scientific. Take the four major coal mines that have already been mined (Open-pit Mine, Shengli Mine, Longfeng Mine, and Laohutai Mine) as examples, its recoverable reserves are getting smaller and smaller, and the effective mining life does not exceed ten years. At the same time, the two pairs of vertical shafts of Shengli Mine have a history of nearly fifty years and are also located 60 meters north of the eastern end of the Open-pit Mine. This not only restricts the northward development of the Open-pit Mine, but also causes the shafts of Shengli Mine to be skewed, the coal pillars to be destroyed, and the ground in the northern part of the coal area to collapse due to the continued mining of the Open-pit Mine. The eastern part of the coal area is like this, and the western part is also caused by several rock slides during the Japanese puppet period, which submerged a large number of mining faces, reducing the mining area by two-thirds compared to the past.

Comrades, our country's industry is leaping forward at a rapid pace, and the amount of coal used by the people is also increasing day by day. Fushun, the coal capital, must also shoulder a more important task than in the past and must undergo a comprehensive transformation to meet the needs of socialist construction. For example, Shengli Mine has to move, the Open-pit Mine has to be expanded, and the mining and transportation methods have to undergo a reform.

Now, Fushun, the coal capital, has unveiled the prelude to the "overall transformation." On the ground and underground of the 30-mile-long mining area, a large number of workers are投入投入ing into the first batch of new construction, expansion, and reconstruction projects. The development project of the new mining area of Laohutai Mine is proceeding intensely, and the workers proposed to strive to put it into production on this year's National Day. The western shaft of Longfeng Mine is also undergoing equipment installation, and the Liushan inclined shaft of Shengli Mine, which has never produced coal, also held a groundbreaking ceremony on April 27. The Liushan inclined shaft is a nearly modernized new type of mine, and after its completion, its main production and auxiliary production processes will be mechanized. The coal transportation in the upper roadway will use a chain conveyor, the coal transportation on the uphill slope will use a belt conveyor, and electric locomotives will also be used in the roadway. On the ground, a new industrial zone will appear on the south side of the Open-pit Mine, with huge windlasses erected, modern coal preparation plants, coal storage bins that can hold more than 25,000 tons, independent substations, towering welfare buildings for miners, dense power transmission networks… Comrades, after the completion of this batch of projects, Fushun's power coal and coking coal will increase by more than 1.4 million tons compared to last year, and the output of oil shale will also increase by more than 1.3 million tons compared to last year!

In order to restore the youth of the Fushun Coal Mine as soon as possible and to ensure the smooth progress of the huge Liushan inclined shaft project, workers from all over the country and Fushun have given it strong support. Large hoists have been transported from Central and South China, and the Northeast Coal Mining Administration has also sent people to participate in this large and complex design work. In order to solve the transportation problem to the Liushan inclined shaft construction site, the relevant departments have also proposed to guarantee that the railway trunk line will be built to Liushan ahead of schedule. Others, such as the workers of the Open-pit, Longfeng, and Laohutai coal mines, are doing their best to assist the Liushan inclined shaft project in solving the difficulties of hoists, mine cars, and rare equipment, and some have also transferred cadres here. Their strong support has also inspired the labor enthusiasm of the workers of the Liushan inclined shaft project. The workers have put forward a strong slogan: to build the Liushan inclined shaft project well, economically, and quickly on the basis of safety, and strive to produce more industrial coal in advance to accelerate the country's industrialization and to strengthen the forces for defending world peace! Especially after studying our country's draft constitution, the workers' labor enthusiasm is even higher. The advanced masonry arch team of Gao Hongsheng promoted the "periodic masonry arch method" and continuously created new records. At present, they are also carrying out a technological innovation movement aimed at mechanizing masonry arches. They feel that the "building a prosperous and happy socialist society" stipulated in the draft constitution can only be realized in advance in this way.

Dear comrades, in the vast coal sea of Fushun Coal Mine, this is just the beginning of the transformation. The coal reserves in the currently mined areas alone, if calculated based on last year's annual output of the Fushun Mining Bureau, can be mined for more than 180 years. The miners of the motherland's coal capital, with infinite longing for socialism, with the tenacious fighting spirit of the Volunteer Army, use their labor and wisdom to build our coal capital Fushun, so that it can play a greater role in the cause of the motherland's socialist industrialization!

### 咱们的煤都在前进着

    咱们的煤都在前进着
    王失逸亲爱的志愿军某部李守延、文齐渊、何开贤同志：
    分别很久了，提起笔来，千言万语，不知从何说起。但是，我知道，你们急需要知道祖国经济建设的消息。现在，就让我告诉你们按着社会主义的要求进行“总体改造”的煤都抚顺的一点情形吧！同志们，说起来，抚顺煤区的开采已经有一百多年的历史了，它的原煤层蕴藏量也是世界上少有的，煤层有一百二十公尺那么厚，因此，有的人把它称为“千金寨”。但是这个“千金寨”在日本统治时期怎么样呢？请看当时流传着的这首民谣吧：“一到千金寨，就把铺盖卖，新的换旧的，旧的换麻袋。”这有限的字句，包含着无限的辛酸，我们多少劳动兄弟在这里受苦受难，受折磨啊！煤矿本身呢？由于日本帝国主义采取“杀鸡取卵”的开采方式，再加上蒋介石匪帮的大肆破坏，解放时，这里已经是遍地伤痕，体无完肤了。
    但是，朋友们，咱们的党懂得煤是工业的真正食粮，“没有这个食粮，工业就无用武之地了。”（列宁：“在矿工工会全俄第一次创立代表大会上的演说”）因此，解放后不久，就在这里开始了恢复工作，并在很短的时期内，改变了它的面貌。工人们从地下开采出来的原煤，被运到各地供应着全国工业和日用的需要；炼焦煤也被运到鞍山钢铁公司去炼钢。还有，这里出产的油母页岩，为人造石油提供了极丰富的煤油原料。然而，过去开采的还仅是它整个煤层的一部分，其余大部分还依旧埋藏在地下。要把这些煤都开采出来，除了发掘现有矿井的潜在力之外，还必须有计划地改进设备和改造某些矿井。因为有些设备陈旧了，有的矿井设置的地方也不科学。就拿已经开采的四个主要煤矿（露天矿、胜利矿、龙凤矿和老虎台矿）来说吧，它的可采量越来越小，有效的开采年限都不超过十年。同时，胜利矿的两对竖井都有近五十年的历史了，还打在露天矿东端北面六十公尺的地方，这就不光限制了露天矿的向北发展，还会因为露天矿的继续开采，使胜利矿的井筒歪斜，煤柱破坏，煤区北部的地面塌陷。煤区的东部是这样，西部也因为在日伪时期岩石几次滑落，淹没了大量的采煤面，开采面积比过去缩小了三分之二。
    同志们，咱们国家的工业在一日千里地飞跃前进着，人民的生活用煤量也在天天增加，煤都抚顺也必须担负起比过去任何时期更重要的任务，必须来一个全面的改造，以适应社会主义建设的需要。比如说，胜利矿要搬家，露天矿要扩大，开采和运输的方法也要来一次改革。
    现在，煤都抚顺已经揭开了“总体改造”的序幕。在三十多里长矿区的地面和井下，大批职工投入了第一批新建、扩建和改建工程。老虎台矿的新采煤区的开拓工程在紧张地进行着，职工们提出要争取在今年的国庆节投入生产。龙凤矿的西竖井也在进行装备工作，从来没有出过煤的胜利矿的刘山斜井，也于四月二十七日举行了开工典礼。刘山斜井是一个近乎现代化的新型矿井，建成后，它的主要生产和辅助生产的过程都是机械化的。上层巷道运煤将用链板运输机，上山斜坡运煤用皮带运输机，在巷道里也要用电机车。地面上，将在露天矿的南侧出现一片新兴的工业区，竖起巨大的卷扬机，近代化的选煤场，能容两万五千吨以上的贮煤仓，独立的变电所，巍峨耸立的矿工福利大楼，密集的电线运输网……。同志们，这一批工程完成后，抚顺的动力用煤和炼焦煤将比去年增产一百四十多万吨，油母页岩的产量也要比去年增加一百三十多万吨！
    为了使抚顺煤矿早日恢复它的青春，让刘山斜井的巨大工程顺利进行，全国各地和抚顺的工人们都给了它大力的支援。大型绞车从中南运来了，东北煤矿管理局也派人来参加这一庞大复杂的设计工作，为了解决通向刘山斜井工地的交通运输问题，有关部门也提出保证，要提前把铁路干线修到刘山。其他如露天、龙凤和老虎台煤矿的工人们，都极力协助刘山斜井工程解决绞车、矿车和稀有器材的困难，有的还输送干部到这里来。他们的有力支援也鼓舞了刘山斜井工人们的劳动热情，工人们提出了坚强的口号：要在安全的基础上，把刘山斜井工程建设得又好，又省，又快，争取提前出产更多的工业用煤来加速国家的工业化，来壮大保卫世界和平的力量！特别是学习了咱们国家的宪法草案以后，工人们的劳动热情更高了。高洪生先进砌碹小组推行“周期砌碹法”，连续创造了新纪录。目前，他们还在开展着以砌碹机械化为目的的技术革新运动。他们觉得宪法草案上规定的“建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会”，只有这样才能提前实现。
    亲爱的同志们，在抚顺煤矿这个浩瀚的煤海上，这还只是改造的开端。仅目前正在开采地区的煤藏量，要是以去年抚顺矿务局的年产量计算，就可以开采一百八十年以上。祖国煤都的矿工们，怀着对社会主义无限向往的心情，以志愿军的顽强战斗精神，用自己的劳动和智慧，来建设咱们的煤都抚顺，让它在祖国的社会主义工业化的事业中发挥更大的作用！
