    Infinite Joy, Heartfelt Support
    Gao Zhen
    In a group meeting of the Henan Provincial People's Congress, twenty-four people's representatives held a serious and enthusiastic discussion on the draft constitution. Each representative's face revealed an expression of infinite excitement and joy.
    Thinking about the past, comparing it to the present, and looking to the future, the representatives deeply felt today's happiness and saw tomorrow's even brighter prospects more clearly. Among the twenty-four representatives in this group, there were workers, farmers, engineers, university professors, literary and art workers, and people's county heads. Although their life experiences and work positions were different, they had a common understanding and feeling, that is, the people are truly the masters of their own affairs today.
    Zhang Taibang, the head of the Shandong Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gong County, is an ordinary farmer. Before liberation, he worked hard all year round but could not get enough to eat or wear. After liberation, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "get organized," he led the farmers of Shandong Township to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, shaking off poverty. Now, he is representing the broad masses of farmers here to speak. He said in a loud voice: Before liberation, farmers suffered generation after generation. In the countryside, power was in the hands of landlords and bullies. Farmers only had the right to be beasts of burden, not the right to speak or act as human beings. The working class brothers were also oppressed. Before liberation, people like us could never attend meetings in the provincial capital. Only today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, can honest people like us be elected as people's representatives to jointly discuss the fundamental law of the country with representatives from the entire province and review the work of the provincial people's government. This is democracy, this is the concrete manifestation of the people being the masters of their own affairs!
    There used to be a saying in the old society: "The government office opens its doors wide, but if you have reason but no money, don't come in." This sentence contains so much bitterness and pain of the working people! Cai Wanjin, the county head of Weishi County, who came from a peasant background, said: Before joining the revolution, my family of five cultivated eight mu of land. The crops harvested from the land were not even enough to pay the Kuomintang reactionaries' exorbitant taxes, leaving the whole family unable to even eat their fill. Once, because I didn't have money to pay miscellaneous taxes, the puppet Baojia chief arrested my wife, detained her for more than twenty days, and then I begged relatives and friends to borrow five silver dollars to redeem her. In the old society, the working people didn't even have the right to eat their fill, so how could they talk about other rights? Speaking of this, he raised his hand, and a look of joy replaced the gloomy expression on his face. He said: I can be the people's county head today, and I have also been elected as a representative to the provincial people's congress. This is something I never dreamed of in the past. Therefore, I have nothing more to say about the people's own draft constitution, except to follow the provisions of the draft constitution, be loyal to the people's democratic system, and be loyal to the people's revolutionary cause!
    Zhao Gengren, a young industrial labor model, said: The reactionary government and laws were entirely for the benefit of the rich and powerful. We workers were never able to eat our fill or keep warm, and we were always worried about our jobs. I started working at the age of fourteen. At that time, I didn't fully understand things, but I was already worried about what would happen when I got old, so I didn't have the heart to work. After liberation, the working class became the masters of the country. Workers not only have guaranteed employment and can participate in major national affairs, but also have a reliable life in their later years. The state has built many sanatoriums and convalescent homes throughout the country to provide workers with rest. Today, the draft constitution uses legislative procedures to fix the various rights enjoyed by the working people. I am fully in favor of it.
    Sitting in the middle of the east side of the venue, a representative wearing a light gray Lenin suit listened to the representatives' speeches with a smiling face. This was the patriotic artist and famous Henan Opera actress Chang Xiangyu. Before liberation, Chang Xiangyu's acting career was filled with hatred for the Kuomintang reactionaries' destruction of art and artists. For more than ten years, although she has been loyal to the art career, modestly learning, and achieving good results, she has suffered insults and persecutions from the ruling class everywhere in the old society. Since liberation, her life has undergone tremendous changes, and her artistic career has been cared for by the state and the people. Today, she has been elected as a representative to the provincial people's congress and is discussing state affairs with other representatives. Therefore, at the group meeting, she connected her own personal experiences, compared the tremendous changes in her life before and after liberation, and said excitedly: After liberation, I personally experienced that the people are truly the masters of their own affairs. Before liberation, women were restricted by layers of shackles. Old operas promoted that women should "not leave the front door, not step on the second door." Women were not even allowed to leave the gate, so how could they talk about democracy and freedom! Today is very different. The draft constitution clearly stipulates that women have equal rights with men; and marriage, family, mothers, and children are protected by the state. I personally can only work hard to study politics and culture, improve my ideological understanding, constantly study my profession, conscientiously cultivate the next generation, and resolutely ensure that art serves the workers and peasants!
    The discussion became more and more heated, and one speech followed another. When each representative talked about their current happiness, they naturally related it to the pain they encountered in their past lives; they felt infinitely excited about the various rights of the people affirmed in today's draft constitution, and expressed that they must fulfill their due obligations well. In the discussion, everyone also expressed with full confidence that they must be good masters of their own affairs and live up to the people's entrustment and trust.

专栏：广大人民热烈讨论宪法草案

    无限的欢欣，衷心的拥护

    在河南省人民代表大会会议的一个小组会上，二十四位人民代表对宪法草案进行了严肃、热烈的讨论。每一个代表的脸上都流露出无限兴奋和喜悦的神情。
    想想过去，比比现在，望望将来，代表们都深深感到今天的幸福，更清楚地看见明天更美好的前途。这一小组的二十四位代表中，有工人，有农民，有工程师，有大学教授，有文艺工作者，也有人民的县长。尽管他们的生活经历不同，工作岗位不同，但是他们却有一个共同的体会和感受，这就是人民今天真正当家作主了。
    巩县山东乡农业生产合作社社长张太邦是一位普通的农民。解放前，他一年累到头，得不到温饱。解放后，他遵照着毛主席的“组织起来”的指示，领导山东乡农民走互助合作的道路，摆脱了穷困。现在他又代表着广大农民在这里发言了。他用宏亮的声音说：解放前，农民世世代代受苦受罪，农村中大权掌握在地主恶霸手中，农民只有做牛做马的权，没有说话作人的权。工人老大哥也是一样受压迫。解放前，上省里开会那有咱这种人。只有今天，在毛主席的领导下，咱这老实人才能被选为人民代表，同全省的代表共同讨论国家的根本大法，审查省人民政府的各项工作，这就是民主，这就是人民当家作主的具体表现！
    旧社会里有句俗话：“衙门八字开，有理没钱莫进来。”这句话里包含了劳动人民多少辛酸痛苦啊！农民出身的尉氏县县长蔡万金说：参加革命前，我家五口人，种了八亩地，地里收的庄稼还不够交反动派的苛捐杂税，弄得全家大小连饭也吃不饱。有一次，因为我没钱交杂捐，伪保甲长就把我的女人抓走了，押了二十多天，以后求亲告友借了五块现洋，才把人赎回来。旧社会劳动人民连吃饱饭的权都没有，还能谈到其他权利吗？说到这里他把手一扬，阴沉的脸上转露了喜悦，他说：我今天能当上人民的县长，又当选了省人民代表，这是过去作梦也想不到的事情。因此对于人民自己的宪法草案，我没有更多的话可说，只有按着宪法草案所规定的，效忠于人民民主制度，效忠于人民革命事业！
    年轻的工业劳动模范赵庚任说：反动派的政府和法律，完全是给有钱有势的人办事的。我们工人，一天到晚吃不饱，穿不暖，整天还担心自己的职业。我从十四岁就开始作工，那时还不完全懂事，就耽心老了怎么办了，那有心思作工；解放后，工人阶级当了国家的主人，工人不仅劳动有保障，能够过问国家的大事，而且晚年生活也有依靠。国家在全国各地修建了许多休养所、疗养院，供给工人休养，今天宪法草案又通过立法的手续把劳动人民享受的各种权利固定下来，我万分拥护。
    坐在会场东头靠中间的一位代表，穿着浅灰色的列宁服，满脸笑容地听着代表们的发言，这是爱国艺人、豫剧名演员常香玉。解放前，常香玉的演戏生涯中，充满了对国民党反动派摧残艺术和艺人的仇恨。十多年来，她虽然一直忠实于艺术事业，虚心学习，获得良好的成就，但是在旧社会却到处遭受统治阶级的侮辱和迫害。解放以来，她的生活起了巨大的变化，她的艺术事业受到国家和人民的爱护。今天她又当选了省人民代表大会代表，和其他代表一道来商讨国家大事。因此，小组会上，她联系自己的切身体会，对比了解放前后生活的巨大变化，激动而兴奋地说：解放后，我是亲身体会到人民真正当家做主了。解放前，妇女受层层束缚。旧戏里面就天天宣传妇女要“头门不出，二门不踩”，大门都不准妇女出，那还能谈到什么民主、自由！今天就大不相同了。宪法草案就明确规定，妇女享有同男子平等的权利；并且婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童，都受到国家的保护。我个人只有努力学习政治和文化，提高思想认识，不断钻研业务，认真培养下一代，并坚决做到艺术为工农群众服务！
    讨论越来越热烈，发言一个接着一个。每个代表谈到目前的幸福时，都很自然的联系到以往生活所遇到的痛苦；对于今天宪法草案中肯定下来的人民的种种权利，感到无限兴奋，并表示一定要很好地尽自己应尽的义务。讨论中大家还信心百倍地表示，一定当好家做好主，决不辜负人民的付托和信任。
