    西南博物院主办的中国人民志愿军特级英雄、特等功臣黄继光烈士的生前事迹展览，从今年二月开始已先后在四川省成都、内江、自贡、宜宾、泸州、万县和重庆市等地巡回展出。各地共有三十多万人参观了这一展览。重庆市自七月十一日展出以来，赶来参观的有八万多人。在自贡市展出时，有的农民跑四十里路去参观。
    展出的共有二十四幅照片和描绘烈士童年、参军、出国作战和英勇牺牲情形的四十幅连环画，还有烈士参军前穿的棉衣、当民兵时使用的武器等遗物和各地追悼黄继光烈士的图片。展出的图片和遗物，显示了黄继光从一个普通农村青年，经过党的教育变成共产主义的先进战士的过程。参观的人们都受到了一次爱国主义和国际主义的教育。重庆市一字街小学少年先锋队第三中队的学生们在意见簿上写道：最亲爱的黄继光叔叔，从今以后，我们全中队队员的学习成绩一定要达到四分以上。自贡市新生农业生产合作社社长参观后，表示要以搞好生产合作社来纪念黄继光烈士。（新华社）
