    Further Help All Agricultural Production Cooperatives to Do a Good Job in Production
    The agricultural production cooperatives in various regions, as a result of spring plowing and production combined with political work, have made significant achievements in increasing production and consolidating organizations. The achievements of agricultural production cooperatives have created a relatively good impression among the broad masses and have prepared better conditions for large-scale development after the autumn harvest. This is undeniable. However, complacency and stagnation must be avoided. A careful analysis of the current agricultural production cooperatives reveals that problems still exist.
    According to the latest materials reflected by various regions, the general situation of agricultural production cooperatives is as follows: those with good production, good management, and consolidated organization account for only about 30% of the total number of cooperatives; those with a lack of advanced performance in production work, where various production measures and farming techniques are basically still at the level of mutual aid teams, and where there are still many problems in management that need to be improved, generally account for about 50% to 60% of the total number of cooperatives. The main shortcoming of these cooperatives is the lack of significant increase in production. In some places, after a preliminary estimate of the actual income of cooperative members, it has been found that a certain number of members will have reduced income (the reasons for the reduced income are various, but the lack of increased production is one of the fundamental reasons). Therefore, the good influence of these cooperatives among the masses has not been firmly established. In addition, there are about 10% (up to 20% in individual places) of cooperatives where production work is not done well, and if efforts are not made, there is a possibility of reduced production. Within these cooperatives, there are also many problems, such as confusion in the thinking of cooperative members and the occurrence of mid-term withdrawals. If a fundamental change cannot be achieved before the autumn harvest, there is a danger of collapse. Moreover, if attention is not paid to strengthening the leadership of the cooperative movement, the proportion of the third type of cooperatives will gradually increase. In the entire cooperative movement, the development of cooperatives will not be absolutely balanced, and the advanced, intermediate, and backward states of work will always exist; however, increased production and increased income for cooperative members should be the minimum conditions for the existence and development of any cooperative. The actual task of the leaders is to care about the production situation of each cooperative and help all cooperatives to increase production and change the backward state of each cooperative in production.
    It must be pointed out that the leading departments of the Party in many regions have shortcomings in helping agricultural production cooperatives improve production. The main shortcoming is the lack of consistency in work. After the spring plowing was over, the leadership relaxed somewhat, which contributed to the spontaneous state of some cooperatives. The reason for this is that many comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the difficulties and complexities that will be encountered in running this new type of economic organization, the agricultural production cooperative. They do not understand or do not fully understand that this new collective economy of agricultural production cooperatives is completely unfamiliar, unaccustomed, and inexperienced for farmers who were still engaged in individual operations not long ago. Agricultural production cooperatives are advancing in the process of gradually overcoming and transforming the conservative ideas of farmers who are content with the status quo. The production potential of the cooperative cannot be fully realized by one-time planning, and technical reforms cannot be solved by a single call. The habit of collective labor cannot be established all at once, but must be gradually enriched in content and improved in its shortcomings through practical struggles, and thus the production work and consolidation and improvement work of the cooperative must be carried out continuously and consistently. Secondly, the Party's leadership in many regions has grasped the few and relaxed the many, focusing only on helping the work of a few advanced cooperatives while relaxing the leadership of the majority of cooperatives. Too many cadres are stacked in advanced cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives, while general cooperative cadres are scarce and backward cooperatives are unattended. This has transformed the focus of work into isolated islands or academic research rooms isolated from the outside world, preventing a large number of intermediate cooperatives from being improved in a timely manner, and the backward ones continue to lag behind. This abnormal state of guidance must be corrected immediately. Some comrades also regard the Party's political leadership and policy guidance for cooperatives as unrelated to economic production work, and regard economic production work as purely technical work without questioning it, content with being laymen, and not understanding that in real life, politics and economics are inherently inseparable. If the Party does not care about the economic production work of the cooperatives, does not study the various technical measures related to increasing production, and does not study management, but only engages in empty talk about policy guidance, the result is tantamount to abandoning all leadership. In addition, some places have squeezed out the central task of agricultural cooperativization because they are busy with summer requisition and purchase, flood prevention, and waterlogging prevention. It must be understood that the agricultural cooperativization movement is the central link in promoting various rural tasks, and it is more advantageous to rely on mutual assistance and cooperation organizations to carry out summer requisition and purchase, flood prevention, and waterlogging prevention.
    It is now entirely necessary to call the attention of the leaders in various regions to these actual situations existing in the work of agricultural production cooperatives, and to quickly take effective measures to strengthen the leadership of the cooperatives in production. The specific requirements are: first, to strive for a significant increase in production in the majority of cooperatives; second, to universally change the face of backward cooperatives, reduce the backward areas to a minimum, and strive to consolidate all cooperatives. From the current agricultural season and rural work tasks, it is still an extremely favorable time. From now on, there are nearly two months left until the autumn harvest, and the tense season of summer production has not passed. For example, in the north, summer hoeing, weeding, and applying topdressing fertilizer are underway, and cotton is being pruned and topped; in the southern rice areas, early rice is being harvested, second-season rice is still being turned and transplanted, and late autumn crops are being prepared; disaster-stricken areas are fighting the most intense battle against floods, droughts, and insect pests. This is a critical juncture for deciding production. From the current overall rural work, the wheat pre-purchase and unified purchase tasks are proceeding relatively smoothly due to the bumper wheat harvest. The unified sales work has gradually become normal, and other work tasks after the autumn harvest have not yet arrived, which is convenient for concentrating efforts to lead the activities of agricultural production cooperatives. This opportunity should not be missed.
    In order to further increase the production of cooperatives and consolidate cooperatives, it is necessary to focus on the following aspects of work:
    1. Help all cooperatives find the secrets to further increase production based on the local agricultural season and the production conditions of each cooperative, and seize the important links of increasing production to make outstanding achievements. By region, in the Northeast region, more harrowing and harrowing is needed; in the North China region, more hoeing and application of topdressing fertilizer is needed; in the southern rice areas, more second-season rice and regenerated rice should be planted; in the flood-stricken areas, drainage and flood prevention should be actively carried out, and late-maturing crops should be replanted. According to the different conditions of each cooperative, some should focus on increasing fertilizer, some should focus on tidying up the land, and some should build water conservancy projects. In short, we should adapt to local conditions, adapt to the conditions of each cooperative, find the key, and seize the opportunity to carry out production. In terms of the scope of operations, in addition to concentrating the main force on doing a good job in agricultural production, diversified operations must be carried out, such as fishing and pig breeding. The development of fishery production is particularly important in the southern flood-stricken areas. After finding the secrets to increase production and seizing the key to increase production, the original production plan should be revised and supplemented, and specific methods should be formulated. The preparation of production materials (seeds, fertilizers, and tools, etc.), the allocation and deployment of labor, and technical measures and equipment must be specifically resolved. In order to give full play to the production enthusiasm of cooperative members, we can consider starting with a summary of the cooperative's production or a trial calculation of distribution to review the production plan. Taking this approach, for the vast majority of cooperatives that have already achieved production results, can specifically make cooperative members realize the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, thereby further increasing their confidence in striving to increase production; for a small number of cooperatives with poor production, can arouse their vigilance and further strive to increase production. Leading agencies should organize the exchange and evaluation of production experience between cooperatives. This work should be started now and should not be postponed until the autumn harvest. Party committees and governments at all levels should continue to assist cooperatives in overcoming various difficulties encountered in increasing production without slackening their efforts.
    2. In order to effectively carry out production and ensure the implementation of the cooperative's production plan, rationally organizing labor, giving play to the enthusiasm of labor, and improving labor efficiency so that land is used to its fullest and people are used to their talents, becomes a decisive link. Although various regions have made achievements in the organization of labor in cooperatives, the phenomenon of wasting work, no one being responsible, and restricting the full play of labor is still a common problem. To fundamentally solve this problem, it is necessary to universally implement the piece-rate system in cooperatives. However, due to the diversity and complexity of agricultural production and our lack of experience in this area, it is difficult to implement it immediately, and we must gradually seek solutions. At present, we should first universally promote the small-scale contracting system. This is to stipulate a certain quantity, quality, and work points in certain farm work in the production team as the unit and contracted to the cooperative collectively by the team. The existing experience in various regions proves that this is a simple and easy-to-implement and relatively reasonable method. Its advantages are: first, it is a simple and primary piece-rate system, more work more pay, which can improve the enthusiasm of labor; second, this method itself embodies the responsibility system, which can stimulate the initiative of cooperative members and eliminate the phenomenon of relying solely on the team leader to assign work, cooperative members being passive, resulting in wasted work and no one being responsible; third, it is simple and easy to implement, and can quickly achieve results in labor. After this collective small-scale contracting system with the team as the unit has gained experience, it will gradually transition to seasonal or year-round contracting system and the piece-rate system for cooperative members. After the agricultural production cooperatives implement the temporary contracting system and the piece-rate system, they should save the original records of various piece-rate systems to accumulate experience for the future piece-rate system and the contracting system of output. While implementing the contracting system, attention must be paid to the balance of labor and work between teams, and the uniform standard of work points; when entering production after contracting, attention must be paid to the inspection of work quality and the establishment of a reward and punishment system. The use of labor within the cooperative must adopt a reasonable division of labor and industries so that all kinds of labor have work to do and can be brought into play. It is necessary to expand the attendance rate of labor and use it for intensive farming and basic construction of production. At present, some cooperatives are not actively looking for ways out for labor from expanding production, leaving some labor idle; some cooperative members are afraid that if they invest more labor, they will share less, so they restrict the investment of labor. This conservative and selfish view must be educated and overcome.
    3. We must help agricultural production cooperatives establish financial management systems and accounting books. Chaotic accounting books have become the most prominent problem in the management of cooperatives. If this problem is not solved in time, it will become more serious as cooperatives develop on a large scale in the future. We must never regard the accounting work of the cooperative as a purely technical work and an unimportant matter. On the contrary, it is a major issue that concerns the entire economic planning, cost accounting, and rational distribution of the cooperative and is related to the vital interests of each cooperative member. The senior leading agencies in various regions must take various effective measures to solve this problem in general. First, a group of people familiar with accounting work should be concentrated to study a temporary, simple, and easy-to-use accounting book on the spot and issue it to various cooperatives for adoption; second, train the existing accounting personnel of cooperatives in the county or region as the unit. Those who have been trained should be regularly checked to help them apply what they have learned to practice in light of the specific situation of the cooperative; third, organize a group of people familiar with accounting business in the county as the unit, after learning, distribute them to the countryside to specifically help cooperatives establish the necessary accounting system; fourth, with the cooperative that has experience in accounting books as the center, carry out the mutual teaching and learning movement between cooperatives; fifth, if conditions permit, each county can transfer several people with accounting experience from the existing authorized quota to engage in the circulating guidance of financial accounting business of agricultural production cooperatives for a long time. Sixth, in areas where cooperatives have developed more, if conditions permit, a cadre can also be assigned to the agricultural technology extension station to guide the accounting work of cooperatives; seventh, the accounting work of supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions has a foundation and a large number of accounting personnel, and the distribution of the network in the countryside is also very wide. It should help agricultural production cooperatives to do a good job in accounting work as much as possible. This can not only help the development of agricultural cooperatives but also help supply and marketing cooperatives contact the masses of farmers and understand the rural economic situation. In short, the accounting work of agricultural production cooperatives must make certain achievements before the autumn harvest distribution, otherwise, it will encounter greater difficulties during the distribution.
    In order to ensure the effective realization of the above tasks, the key decision lies in the leadership of the Party. The Party's leadership center in rural areas must shift to the production movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has clearly stipulated this in the "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives." Now, the following points are emphasized for explanation: First, the rural work departments above the county level should first convene a meeting of cadres who are familiar with the current situation of agricultural production cooperatives, conduct an analysis and research work on the agricultural production cooperatives in their respective regions, find out where the problems lie, and formulate a solution; and then organize a large number of cadres to conduct a general inspection of all cooperatives as in the spring plowing production. Through inspection, solve existing problems, take production one step further, and push work forward. Second, specialized agencies for managing production cooperation must be established rapidly in the county and prefecture-level committees, and the responsibility system must be implemented in the use of cadres. Pay attention to the leadership work of the majority of general cooperatives and backward cooperatives to make a significant change in their production work. In particular, some stronger cadres should be sent to backward cooperatives to solve their problems. Third, the phenomenon of "counties running communities and not managing" and "districts running cooperatives and townships not managing" that has occurred in some areas must be changed. We should rely on the district committees and branches to run cooperatives and rely on the vast number of district and township cadres to run cooperatives and overcome the phenomenon of monopolizing and substituting. Fourth, we must give play to the driving role of cooperatives in the production of mutual aid groups and individual farmers to promote the progress of the entire agricultural production movement. In this regard, various regions have created a lot of experience, which should be carried forward. This year, the climate has been out of balance, and the floods in many areas are severe, and production has been damaged to a certain extent. This situation has put forward a serious task for the entire agricultural production front. It is necessary to raise the requirements for exceeding the completion of the production increase task in areas that have not been affected by the disaster to make up for this loss. In this sense, the driving role of agricultural production cooperatives is even more important. Fifth, we must engage in various preparatory work for large-scale development after the autumn harvest under the premise of running the existing cooperatives well. Otherwise, the new development work will lack the attractiveness to the masses and lack a solid ideological and material foundation. If these problems are all paid attention to and solved, then, on the basis of the cooperative building work from last winter to this spring and the production work and consolidation work in the past six months, it is entirely possible to strive to run the cooperatives better by making another effort.

    进一步帮助所有农业生产合作社做好生产工作
    各地农业生产合作社，经过春耕生产并结合生产进行政治工作的结果，在提高生产和巩固组织方面，已取得较大的成绩。农业生产合作社所表现的成就，已在广大群众中造成比较良好的印象，已为秋后大发展准备了较好的条件，这一点是不能怀疑的。但是决不可因此而发生自满情绪，故步自封起来。如果把现在的农业生产合作社仔细加以分析，并不是没有问题的。
    根据各地最近反映的材料来看，各地农业生产合作社的大体情况是：生产好、经营管理好、组织巩固的，只占总社数的百分之三十左右；生产工作尚缺乏先进表现，各种生产措施和耕作技术基本上还停留在互助组的水平，经营管理方面也还存在不少问题，需要加以改进的，一般占总社数的百分之五十到六十左右。这些社的主要缺点是增产成绩不显著，有些地方经过初步估算社员的实际收益后，已发现有一定数量的社员将要减少收入（减少收益的原因是各方面的，但增产不多是根本原因之一）。因此，这些社在群众中的良好影响，并未确立；此外还有百分之十左右（个别地方到百分之二十）的社，生产工作做的很不好，如果不加以努力，还有减产的可能。在这些社的内部，存在的问题也很多，社员思想混乱，中途退社的，已有发生。如秋收前不能根本取得转变，就有濒于瓦解的危险。而且，如果不注意加强对合作化运动的领导，第三类社所占的比例，还会逐渐增大。在整个合作运动中，社的发展固然是不会绝对平衡的，工作中的先进、中间与落后状态始终是会存在的；但生产增长和社员收入有所增加，应该是每个社都必须办到和可能办到的。这是任何一个合作社存在和发展的起码条件。领导者的实际任务，就在于关怀每个社的生产状况，帮助所有的社提高生产，改变各个社在生产上的落后状态。
    必须指出不少地区党的领导部门，在帮助农业生产合作社改进生产方面，是有缺点的。主要的缺点是工作缺乏一贯性。在春耕过去之后，领导一度松弛，曾助长了若干合作社的自流状态。其原因是由于许多同志，对办好农业生产合作社这种新型经济组织将遇到的困难与复杂性认识不足。他们不了解或不十分了解农业生产合作社这种新的集体经济，对不久以前还是个体经营的农民来讲，完全是陌生的、不习惯的、没有经验的。农业生产合作社是在逐步克服与改造农民安于现状的保守思想的过程中前进的。社的生产潜力不是一次计划可以充分发挥的，技术改革也不是一声号召所能解决的，集体劳动习惯不是一下子可以树立的，而必须是有领导地随着实践斗争逐步丰富其内容，改进其缺点，从而对社的生产工作与巩固提高工作，也必须连续进行，贯彻始终。其次是不少地区党的领导方面，抓紧了少数而放松了多数，只着重帮助少数先进社的工作，而放松对多数社的领导。先进社、基点社干部堆积太多、一般社干部稀少、落后社则无人照顾。这样使工作重点变成为与外界隔离的孤岛或学院式的研究室，使大量中间状态的社未能及时提高，落后的继续落后下去。这种指导上的不正常状态，是必须立即纠正的。还有些同志，将党对合作社的政治领导和政策指导，认为是与经济生产工作无关，把经济生产工作当作单纯技术工作，而不加过问，自安于外行，而不了解在实际生活中，政治和经济本来是密切不可分的。党不关心合作社的经济生产工作，不去钻研有关增产的各项技术措施，不研究经营管理，而空谈政策指导，其结果无异于放弃了全部领导。此外，有的地方，因忙于夏征夏购、防洪防涝等工作，而把农业合作化运动这项中心工作挤掉了。必须了解，农业合作化运动是推动农村各项工作的中心环节，依靠互助合作组织来开展夏征夏购、防洪防涝等项工作是更为有利的。
    现在完全有必要，提起各地领导上注意一下农业生产合作社工作中所存在的这些实际情况，并迅速地采取有效措施以加强对合作社生产的领导。具体要求是：第一，要争取大多数社有显著的增产；第二，要普遍地改变落后社的面貌，把落后面缩小到最低限度，争取全部社都巩固下来。从目前的农事季节和农村工作任务来说，也还是一个极为有利的时机。从现在算起，离秋收还有将近两个月时间，夏季生产的紧张季节还未过去。如北方正在夏锄、除草、施用追肥，棉花正在整枝打?；南方水稻地区，早稻正在收割，二季稻还在翻田插秧，晚秋作物正在准备；受灾地区正在和水旱虫灾进行最紧张的搏斗。这是决定生产的一个紧要的关头。从目前整个农村工作来说，小麦预购和统购任务因麦子丰收而进行得比较顺利。统销工作已逐渐趋于正常，秋后其他各项工作任务还未到来，正便于集中力量去领导农业生产合作社的活动。这个时机是不应该放过的。
    为了进一步提高合作社的生产，巩固合作社，必须抓紧以下几个方面的工作：
    一、帮助所有合作社根据当地的农事季节和各社的生产条件，寻找进一步增产的窍门，并抓住增产的重要环节，突出地做出成绩来。按地区说，在东北地区是要多铲、多埫，华北地区要多锄、多施追肥，南方水稻地区要多种二季稻和再生稻，水灾地区要积极排涝防水和改种晚熟作物等。按各社不同条件来讲，有的要用力于增肥，有的要用力于整理土地，有的要兴修水利等。总之应因地制宜，因社制宜，各找关键，抓紧进行。按经营的范围来说，除集中主要力量搞好农业生产以外，必须进行多种经营，如捕鱼、养猪等。发展渔业生产在南方水灾区尤为重要。在找到增产窍门、抓住增产关键之后，应修订与充实原来的生产计划并订出具体作法，对生产资料（种籽、肥料与工具等）的准备，劳力的调配与投放，技术措施与设备等问题必须具体解决。为了充分发挥社员的生产积极性，可考虑以总结本社生产或试算分配的方式入手，来审订生产计划。采取这种方式，对于绝大多数生产已有成绩的社来说，可以具体地使社员群众了解到农业生产合作社的优越性，从而进一步提高其努力增产的信心；对少数生产不好的社来说，可以引起他们的警惕，进一步努力增产。领导机关应组织社与社间的生产经验交流和评比工作，这种工作现在就应动手，不应推到秋收时才进行。各级党和政府应毫不松懈地继续援助各社克服在增产中所遇到的各种困难。
    二、为了有效地进行生产，保证合作社生产计划的实施，合理地组织劳动力，以发挥劳动的积极性，提高劳动效率，使地尽其利，人尽其才，就成为有决定意义的一环。在合作社的劳力组织方面，各地虽已取得成绩，但窝工浪费、无人负责、限制劳动力充分发挥的现象仍然是带有普遍性的问题。这一问题要求得根本的解决，就要在合作社中普遍实行定额计件制。但由于农业生产的多样性、复杂性以及我们在这方面还没有经验，现在还难以马上实行，必须有步骤地逐步求得解决。在目前应首先普遍地推行小包耕制。这就是以生产小组或生产队为单位，在一定农活中规定一定数量、质量和工分，由组、队向社集体包耕。各地已有的经验证明，这是一种简便易行而又比较合理的方法。它的优点在于：第一，它已是一种简单的初级的定额计件制，多劳多得，从而可以提高劳动的积极性；第二，这种办法本身就体现着责任制，可以激发社员的主动性，免除单靠社长派工，社员被动，以致窝工浪费而无人负责的现象；第三，简便易行，可以在劳动方面迅速取得效果。在这种以组或队为单位的集体的小包耕制取得经验之后，再逐步过渡到季节的或常年的包耕制和社员个人的定额计件制。农业生产合作社在实行临时包耕制和计件制之后，就应把各种计件的原始记录保存下来，为未来的定额计件制和包耕包产制积累经验。在实行包耕制的同时，必须注意到组与组、队与队之间劳力和活计的平衡，工分标准的统一；在包工后进入生产的时候，必须注意工作质量的检查并建立奖惩制度。社内劳力使用，必须采取合理的分工、分业，使各种劳力都有活做，都能发挥。必须扩大劳动的出勤率，使用于土地精耕细作和生产的基本建设方面。目前有些合作社，不积极从扩大生产方面为劳力寻找出路，使一部分劳力空闲着；有些社员则害怕劳力投放多了自己分益少，因而限制劳力投放。这种保守自私观点，必须进行教育，加以克服。
    三、必须帮助农业生产合作社建立财务管理制度和会计账目。会计账目混乱，已成为目前合作社经营管理方面一个最突出的问题。如果不及时加以解决，以后合作社大量发展，问题将会更严重。我们决不可把社的会计工作看作是一种单纯的技术工作和无关重要的事情。恰恰相反，它是关乎合作社整个经济规划、成本核算、合理分配并联系到每个社员切身利益的大事。各地高级领导机关，必须采取各种有力措施，使这个问题获得大体解决。第一、应集中一批熟悉会计工作的人材，就地取材，研究一种临时的简便易行的会计账目，发各社采用；第二、以县或专署为单位训练现有合作社的会计人员，已训练过的，应经常检查，帮助他们结合本社的具体情况，把所学到的东西运用到实际中去；第三、以县为单位组织一批熟悉会计业务的人，经过学习以后，分配下乡，具体帮助合作社建立必要的会计制度；第四、以会计账目已有经验的社为中心，开展各社间的互教互学运动；第五、如果条件允许，各县可以在现有的编制名额中，抽调若干有会计经验的人，长期专门从事对农业生产合作社财务会计业务的巡回指导工作。第六、在社的发展已经较多的区，如有条件也可以在农业技术推广站中配备一个指导合作社会计工作的干部；第七、各地供销合作社会计工作已有基础、有较多的会计人员，在农村中分布的面也很广，应该尽可能就近帮助农业生产合作社做好会计工作。这不仅可以帮助农业合作社的发展，而且有利于供销社联系农民群众，了解农村经济情况。总之，农业生产合作社的会计工作，务必在秋收分配前作出一定成绩，否则到分配时将会遇到更大的困难。
    为了保证以上任务的有效实现，决定的关键还在于党的领导。农村党的领导中心必须转移到以互助合作为中心的生产运动方面来。关于这一点，中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议中已有明白的规定。现再就下列几点着重加以说明：第一，县以上的农村工作部门，应首先召集熟悉目前农业生产合作社情况的干部举行会议，把自己所属地区的农业生产合作社作一番分析和研究工作，找出问题的所在，订出解决问题的方案；而后组织大批干部力量如同春耕生产时一样，认真地对所有合作社来一番普遍的检查工作。通过检查，解决现存问题，把生产提高一步，把工作推向前进。第二，县、地两级委员会内，管理生产合作的专门机构必须迅速建立，在使用干部力量上，必须执行责任制。注意到多数的一般社和落后社的领导工作，使他们的生产工作有一个显著的转变。特别是落后社，应派一些较强干部去解决他们的问题。第三，对目前一些地区所发生的“县办社区不管”和“区办社乡不管”的现象必须加以转变。应该依靠区委和支部办社，依靠广大区乡干部办社，克服包办代替现象。第四，必须发挥合作社对互助组和单干农民生产的带动作用，以推动整个农业生产运动的前进。在这方面，各地已创造了不少经验，应该加以发扬。今年气候失调，不少地区水灾严重，生产已受到一定程度的损失。这种形势已给整个农业生产战线提出一个严重任务，必须在未受灾的地区提高超额完成增产任务的要求，来弥补这个损失。在这个意义上讲，农业生产合作社的带动作用就更显得重要。第五，必须在办好现有合作社的前提下，来从事秋后大发展的各项准备工作。否则，新的发展工作就缺乏对群众的吸引力，缺乏思想的和物质的坚实基础。如果这些问题都注意到了，都解决了，那么，在去冬今春的建社工作与半年来的生产工作和巩固工作的基础上，再努一把力，争取把社办的更好，是完全可能的。
