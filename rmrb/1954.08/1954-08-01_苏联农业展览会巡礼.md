    A Visit to the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition
  　By维·叶尔朔夫 (Wéi Yè'ěrshuòfū)
    The car travels along Yaroslavl Street, passing through the Rostokino District of the capital. In the distance, above the dense linden trees, the golden spires of many buildings and glass-covered domes glittering in the sunlight appear. This is the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition.
    …At the entrance of the exhibition, on the majestic triumphal arch, stand statues of a tractor driver and a female collective farm member holding a bundle of golden wheat ears high. These statues are the symbol of the exhibition.
    A wide boulevard leads to the main pavilion of the exhibition. The pavilion is surrounded by double-layered columns, and the golden spire with a star on top of the building has been completed. The architect Shukov built this magnificent, towering building. Groups of statues, the national emblems of the sixteen republics, the national emblem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the four golden letters "CCCP" decorate this building.
    Visitors begin their tour of the exhibition from this main pavilion. The various halls of the exhibition display the strength of the Soviet state, the genius of the people, the wisdom of the Communist Party, and the great strength of the collective farm system. In the foyer of the pavilion, decorated with red marble and gold, is engraved the phrase "The Great October Revolution opened a new era in human history—the era of communism."
    Visitors enter the circular hall from the foyer, where several flags flutter on a pedestal in the center of the hall. The walls are adorned with excerpts from the Soviet Constitution and brightly colored murals. One of them depicts the unforgettable scene of the opening of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal: ships passing through the arches of the first lock amidst the cheers of the people. Another painting depicts the new buildings of Moscow University—a symbol of the world's most advanced Soviet science. The third painting is of the Black Sea coast: the bright southern sun, green palm trees, marble palaces, sanatoriums, and Soviet people at rest. The fourth is of the Moscow Kremlin: workers, collective farmers, scholars, and representatives of the people walking towards the hall of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The white dome of the circular hall is very beautiful. It is decorated with a golden star, and on the frieze is written a sentence from the Soviet national anthem: "Great Russia has forever united the free republics into a strong union."
    The branch pavilions showcase the great victories of the collective farm system. There are now ninety-four thousand collective farms and four thousand seven hundred state farms in the Soviet Union. On a giant map of the Soviet Union are marked more than nine thousand glowing dots, which are the machine tractor stations—the material and technical foundation of socialist agriculture. The platforms introducing the advanced collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations of the Soviet Union showcase the development of the grain economy, which serves as the basis for all agricultural production. In exquisite vases and artistic conical glassware are displayed abundant products: bundles of wheat, rye, barley, oats, corn, hemp stalks several meters long, snow-white cotton, fruits, and vegetables.
    The exhibition extensively reflects the close connection between advanced Soviet science and agricultural practice.
    Visitors leaving the main hall reach Central Square. Here are two fountains named "Friendship of the Peoples of the Soviet Union" and "Stone Flower." The square is surrounded by many display pavilions of various republics, border regions, and states. Looking out over Central Square, you can see a beautiful picture: in the bright sunlight, the richest folk carved patterns, gemstones, glittering azure, pottery, and marble present a colorful scene, all surrounded by the tender green of fruit trees and beautifying trees, and flower beds of various colors.
    A total of 36,000 large trees, nearly 450,000 shrubs, more than 40,000 superior varieties of roses, 400,000 perennial flowers, and 5 million annual horticultural crops have been planted in the orchards and gardens beautifying the exhibition.
    The exhibition introduces the typical landscaping of collective farms, state farms, machine tractor stations, and homesteads. Not far from the main entrance is the cultural and recreation park of the collective farm, including a sports field, boulevards, and tennis courts for relaxation. Each showroom points out the prosperity of the national cultures of the peoples of the Soviet Union, revealing the natural wealth of the republics, border regions, and states, and their dominant economic sectors.
    The pavilions of the various republics are decorated in national styles. The exhibition halls of the Novgorod Oblast, Pskov Oblast, Velikie Luki Oblast, and several other states in the northern Russian Federation adopt the ancient Russian architectural style. At the entrance of the Uzbek pavilion is a surprisingly light circular building with a fountain. In the foyer of the Far East pavilion are murals depicting the abundance and vastness of this vast border region: forest-covered hills, magnificent rivers, vast plains, bays, and lush Siberian taiga. In the pavilion of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, red granite columns are topped with a relief pediment made of Karelian pine. In one of the halls of this pavilion stands a statue carved from Karelian pine of an old man sitting on a stump and playing a musical instrument.
    Although the exterior decoration of the exhibition is very gorgeous, the exhibits displayed inside the halls are even more beautiful, and these exhibits are the crystallization of the heroic labor of Soviet agricultural workers.
    The Soviet Agricultural Exhibition reflects the achievements made by socialist agriculture in the post-war period and is like a glorious summary of the collective farm system, which has been in existence for twenty-five years. The exhibits displayed in more than 300 pavilions and other buildings on a 207-hectare site, in greenhouses and hotbeds, and in the open air, fully reveal the advanced experience gained in various agricultural production sectors.
    Some signs introduce the "Kirov" Collective Farm in the Korenovsky District of the Krasnodar Territory. This collective farm harvested an average of 23 quintals of winter wheat per hectare from 6,000 hectares of land last year; they also introduced the Verkhneuralsky District of the Chelyabinsk Oblast, which averaged 20 quintals of spring wheat per hectare from 60,000 hectares of land last year.
    The exhibition features 350 kinds of grain crops, including the world-famous Kuban, Altai, and Ukrainian wheat, high-yielding, strong pest-resistant wheat that is not afraid of drought and torrential rain—crested wheatgrass hybrids, perennial wheat developed by Academician Tsitsin, a new variety of wheat that can be harvested four times without transplanting.
    In the "Grain" Pavilion, the "State Farm" Pavilion, the "Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic" Pavilion, and the "Siberia" Pavilion, the exhibition on the work of reclaiming virgin and abandoned land occupies an important position. Millions of hectares of land have been reclaimed and sown this year, but this is only the beginning, and there is still a huge amount of work ahead. For this reason, the valuable experience gained by the Rukiniev Machine Tractor Station in the Kokchetav Oblast of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, the Petropavlovsk State Farm in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, and other machine tractor stations and state farms in the work of reclaiming virgin and abandoned land is particularly worthy of cherishing.
    A sharp rise in all sectors of animal husbandry is an urgent task. The exhibition attaches great importance to this very important economic sector. The achievements of advanced animal husbandry workers are displayed in seventy-nine specialized pavilions and showrooms. Soviet agriculture is the most mechanized agriculture in the world. In the center of the exhibition, in the square with a circular pool, the dome of the Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification Exhibition Hall, probably the largest building in the exhibition, rises. At the entrance are six strong men—six red "ДТ—54" tractors.
    About 800 kinds of the latest domestically produced machines and farm implements are displayed in the twenty-six halls of the exhibition hall. Among them are large tractors for reclaiming virgin land and uprooting stumps, smaller tractors for plowing, and very small tractors for planting vegetables, various brands of harvesting combines: "Stalinets-9", "Stalinets-8" self-propelled harvesting combines, harvesting combines for flax, potatoes, corn, and sugar beets, and various machines for cultivating plants and planting plants.
    Even a general overview of the exhibition is difficult to describe in one article. And our vast Soviet land is much richer than what is displayed here.
    In the hall of the North Caucasus exhibition pavilion under the shade of palm trees are piles of grain, wheat, amber-like golden corn, fragrant tobacco leaves, and long-fiber wool. There are also bundles of grapes, barrels of fragrant wine, and mountains of fruit.
    The Michurin Orchard, covering an area of six hectares, illustrates the selfless labor and firm ideas of the great innovator. In this orchard, you can collect the best fruits in the country—there are hundreds of kinds of fruit and berry plants here.
    The entire exhibition clearly confirms the Communist Party and the Soviet government's great concern for socialist agricultural workers and the further development of the collective farm system. Lenin once said these inspiring words: "Our country has abundant natural resources, sufficient manpower, and beautiful surroundings, and the great revolution will give these resources to the creativity of the people in order to build a truly strong and prosperous Russia." In this exhibition, people can see the great creative power of the Soviet people and the historical victories they have achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party extremely clearly.

    苏联农业展览会巡礼苏联
  　维·叶尔朔夫
    汽车沿着雅罗斯拉夫大街，驶过首都的罗斯托金区。远处，在浓密的菩提树梢上出现了许多建筑物的金色尖塔，和在阳光下闪闪发光的镶着玻璃的圆形屋顶。这里就是苏联农业展览会。
    ……在展览会入口处的雄伟的凯旋门上站立着一个拖拉机手和一个高举着一束金黄色麦穗的集体农庄女庄员的雕像。这一对雕像就是展览会的象征。
    宽阔的林荫道通向展览会的主馆。展览馆的周围环绕着双层列柱，建筑物上面，带星的金色尖顶业已完工。建筑师舒科建造了这所宏伟的、高耸的建筑物。一组组的雕像、十六个加盟共和国的国徽、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的国徽和“CCCP”四个金字，装饰着这所建筑物。
    参观的人们从这个主馆开始参观展览会。展览会的各个大厅显示了苏维埃国家的强大、人民的天才、共产党的英明以及集体农庄制度的伟大力量。在用红色大理石和金饰所装饰的展览馆前厅中镂刻着“伟大十月革命开辟了人类历史的新纪元——共产主义的纪元”的字样。
    参观的人们从前厅进入圆形大厅，大厅中央的台座上飘扬着几面旗帜。四围墙上是引自苏联宪法的条文和色泽鲜明的壁画。其中之一画着令人难忘的列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河通航的情景：在人民的欢呼声中轮船通过了第一号水闸的拱门。另一幅画则是莫斯科大学的新建筑——世界最先进的苏联科学的标志。第三幅画是黑海海滨：明朗的南方的太阳、绿荫的棕榈、大理石的宫殿、疗养所和休憩中的苏维埃人。第四幅是莫斯科的克里姆林宫：工人、集体农民、学者、人民的代表们走向苏联最高苏维埃的大厅。圆形大厅的白色圆顶是十分美观的。上面装饰着一颗金星，在壁带上写有从苏联国歌里引出来的一句话：“伟大的俄罗斯把各个自由共和国永远结成了坚强的联盟”。
    在分馆里展示了集体农庄制度的伟大胜利。苏联现在有九万四千个集体农庄，四千七百个国营农场。在巨大的苏联地图上标有九千多个发光的小点，这就是机器拖拉机站——社会主义农业的物质技术基础。介绍苏联的先进集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的台架上，展示了作为整个农业生产基础的谷物经济的发展。在精巧的花瓶里，在艺术的锥形玻璃器中盛着富饶的产品：一束束的小麦、裸麦、大麦、燕麦、玉蜀黍，长达数公尺的大麻干，雪白的棉花，果品和蔬菜。
    展览会上广泛地反映了先进的苏联科学与农业的实践两者之间的紧密联系。
    展览会的参观者从主厅出来就到达中央广场。这里有名为“苏联各族人民的友谊”和“宝石花”的两个喷泉。广场的四周围绕着各个加盟共和国、边疆区和州的许多陈列分馆。如果向中央广场眺望，你就可以看到一幅美丽的图画，在明亮的阳光中，最丰富的人民的雕刻的图案、宝石、金光灿烂的石青、陶器和大理石，呈现着五颜六色，所有这一切，都被果树和使景色优美的树木的嫩绿和各种颜色的花丛所包围。
    在美化展览会的果园和花园里，共种了三万六千株巨大的树木，近四十五万株灌木，四万多株优等品种的玫瑰，四十万株多年生花木和五百万株一年生园艺作物。
    展览会向参观者介绍了绿化集体农庄、国营农场、机器拖拉机站和宅旁园地的典型。离正门不远就是包括有运动场、林荫道、网球场的供休息用的集体农庄的文化和休息公园。每一个陈列室里都指出了苏联各族人民的民族文化的繁荣，揭示了各共和国、边疆区和州的自然财富和他们的经济的主导部门。
    各个加盟共和国的陈列馆都是用民族形式装饰起来的。诺夫哥罗德州、普斯科夫州、维里克鲁克州和俄罗斯联邦北部其他几个州的展览馆采用着古老的俄罗斯的建筑风格。在乌兹别克陈列馆的入口处是带有喷泉的轻巧得令人惊奇的圆形小建筑物。在远东陈列馆的前厅有描绘了这个广大边区的丰裕和辽阔的壁画：布满了森林的丘陵，壮阔的河流，广大的平原，海湾和葱绿的西伯利亚大密林。在卡累利阿—芬兰苏维埃社会主义共和国的陈列馆里，红色的花冈石圆柱上方，是用卡累利阿的松树所造的带有浮雕的山墙。在这个陈列馆的一个大厅里摆着一个用卡累利阿的松木雕刻的坐在断株上的弹琴老人的雕像。
    展览会的外部装璜虽然十分华丽，但大厅内部所陈列的展览品却更加优美，这些展览品是苏联农业劳动者们英雄劳动的结晶。
    苏联农业展览会反映了社会主义农业在战后所取得的成就，就像是对已有二十五年历史的集体农庄制度作了一次光荣的胜利总结。在建立在二百零七公顷场地上的三百多个陈列馆和其他建筑物里，在暖花房和温室里和在旷场上所陈列的展览品，充分地揭示出了在各个农业生产部门中所取得的先进经验。
      一些说明牌介绍了克拉斯诺达尔边疆区科伦诺夫区的“基洛夫”集体农庄。这个集体农庄去年从六千公顷的土地上，平均每一公顷土地收获了二十
  三公担的冬小麦；它们也介绍了车里雅宾斯克州上乌拉尔区，这个区去年在六万公顷土地上，平均从每公顷收获到二十公担春小麦。
    在展览会上，陈列着三百五十种谷物作物，其中有世界闻名的库班的、阿尔泰的和乌克兰的小麦，收获量高、防御害虫力强，不怕干旱和暴雨不倒的小麦——鹅冠杂种小麦，齐津院士研究成的多年生小麦，这是可以收获四次无需移植的新品种小麦。
    在“谷物”馆、“国营农场”馆、“哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国”馆和“西伯利亚”馆，关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地工作的展览，占据着重要的地位。今年已经开垦了和播种了几百万公顷的土地，但是这还仅仅是开始，前面还有着巨大的工作。正因为如此，哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国科克契塔夫州鲁金耶夫机器拖拉机站，车里雅宾斯克州的彼得罗巴甫洛夫国营农场及其他机器拖拉机站和国营农场，在开垦生荒地和熟荒地工作中取得的宝贵经验是特别值得珍视的。
    使畜牧业各部门急剧高涨是一项迫切的任务。展览会很重视这一非常重要的经济部门。在七十九个专门的展览馆和陈列室里陈列着畜牧业先进工作者的成就。苏联的农业是世界上最机械化的农业。在展览会的中央，在那片有一个圆形水池的广场上，大概是展览会最大的建筑物——农业机械化和电气化展览馆的圆顶耸立在那里。在入口处有六个壮士——六部红色的“ДТ—54”式拖拉机。
    在展览馆的二十六个大厅里陈列着约有八百种国产的最新的机器和农具。其中有开垦生荒地和拔根用的大型拖拉机，旁边是耕作用的较小的拖拉机和种植蔬菜用的非常小的拖拉机，各种牌子的收割联合机：“斯大林涅茨——9”、“斯大林涅茨——8”自动推进收割联合机，收割亚麻、马铃薯、玉蜀黍和甜菜用的收割联合机，以及培植植物和栽种植物用的各种机器。
    即使只谈谈展览会的概况也是在一篇文章里难以尽述的。而我们辽阔的苏维埃国土比这里所陈列的更富饶得多了。
    在棕榈绿荫下的北高加索展览馆的大厅里摆着大堆的谷物、小麦、像琥珀似的金黄的玉蜀黍、芬芳的烟叶、细长纤维的羊毛。这里还有一束束的葡萄，大桶芬香的酒和堆集如山的水果。
    拥有六公顷范围的米丘林果园，说明了伟大革新者的忘我的劳动和坚定的思想。在这个果园里可以采集国内最好的果品——这里有数百种水果和浆果植物。
    整个展览会明显地证实了共产党和苏联政府对社会主义农业劳动者，对集体农庄制度的进一步发展的巨大关怀。列宁曾经说过这样振奋人心的话：“我国拥有丰富的自然财富、充分的人力、优美的环境，而伟大的革命将把这些财富给予人民的创造，以便建立起真正强盛而富饶的俄罗斯”。在这个展览会里，人们可以极其明显地看到苏联人民巨大的创造力量，看到他们在共产党领导下所获得的历史性的胜利。（附图片）
