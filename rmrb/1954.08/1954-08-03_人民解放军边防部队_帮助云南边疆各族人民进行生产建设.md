The People's Liberation Army border troops stationed in the Yunnan border areas have been helping people of all ethnic groups carry out production and construction, and are loved by the people of all ethnic groups.

In the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, various places suffered from insect plagues in July and August last year. The border troops helped to put out the insect pests in disaster areas such as Mengsong. During the autumn harvest, the rainy season lasted more than half a month longer than in previous years, and the Dai people were very anxious when they saw that the heavy ears of grain would spoil in the fields if they were not harvested. After learning about this, the soldiers held a meeting to discuss and decided to rush the harvest of rice for the people of all ethnic groups. The soldiers took tarpaulins and raincoats to build temporary houses by the paddy fields, and rushed to harvest the rice in the wind and rain. In a few days, they rushed to harvest more than 1.8 million catties of rice. A certain company stationed on the Honghe River bank, which had repeatedly made military exploits, helped the Miao, Hani, and other ethnic groups carry 18,000 catties of firewood and 36,000 buckets of water in order to give the local minority people more time for production. Soldiers of a certain unit saved their allowances and bought iron hoes and other agricultural tools to give to the poor Yao people for production. Pan Shuxin, an old Yao man who had been farming with wooden hoes for many years, was so moved that he could not speak for a long time after receiving the iron hoe from the soldiers.

Some border troops choose areas where epidemics are prevalent to set up clinics, while others organize disease prevention teams and medical teams to go to various places to provide free treatment to people of all ethnic groups. In the past year or so, they have examined more than 23,000 people from all ethnic groups in the border areas. The veterinary hospitals set up by the border troops help farmers of all ethnic groups prevent and control livestock diseases. For example, when Tengchong County was transplanting rice this year, foot-and-mouth disease occurred in the working cattle. After six days and nights of intense work by the veterinary hospital of a certain unit, more than 580 working cattle were rescued. Combining medical work, the People's Liberation Army also publicizes the improvement of environmental sanitation and the prevention of diseases to the people of all ethnic groups. The Xin and Lao Safang villages in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region pay attention to cleaning indoor and environmental sanitation, and conduct a major cleaning every week, and the number of people suffering from diseases has decreased.

The people of all ethnic groups in the border areas love the People's Liberation Army, and a deep friendship has been established between the army and the people. In Xishuangbanna, whenever the troops are transferred from their驻地, Dai women tie red threads on the wrists of the soldiers according to national customs to bless them with health. During the New Year and festivals, people of all ethnic groups often travel over mountains and ridges to send the soldiers various gifts, banners and letters of condolences. Last year, the people of all ethnic groups in the Da Yao Mountain on the south bank of the Honghe River made a banner and sent it to the troops. They thought that it could not express their feelings after sending it twice, so they took it back and remade it. Finally, Zhao Dama, a Miao woman, carefully embroidered two peace doves on the banner, tied two beautiful flower balls, and then played the Lusheng and flute and happily sent it.

    人民解放军边防部队
    帮助云南边疆各族人民进行生产建设
    驻守云南边疆的中国人民解放军边防部队，帮助各族人民进行生产建设，受到各族人民的爱戴。
    在西双版纳傣族自治区，去年七、八月间各地发生虫灾，边防部队战士协助扑灭了勐宋等灾区的虫害；秋收时，因雨季比往年延长了半个多月，傣族人民眼看着沉甸甸的谷穗再不收割就要坏在田里，心里非常着急。战士们知道这件事后，开会商讨，决定要把各族人民的稻谷抢收回家，战士们带着油布、雨衣到水田边搭起临时住房，在风雨里抢割稻谷，一连几天，抢收了一百八十多万斤稻谷。驻守红河岸边曾经屡立战功的某连，为使驻地的少数民族人民有更多的时间进行生产，曾帮助苗、哈尼等族人民背烧柴一万八千多斤，挑水三万六千多桶。某部战士节省了津贴，买铁制锄头等农具送给贫苦的瑶族人民生产，多年来用木锄头耕种的瑶族老人潘树新，得到战士们送给的铁锄后，感动得半天说不出话来。
    边防部队有的选择疫病流行的地区设立门诊部，有的组织抗病队和医疗小组，深入各地为各族人民进行免费治疗；近一年多来，并给边疆各族人民两万三千多人检查了身体。边防部队所设的兽医院，帮助各族农民防治牲畜疫病。如腾冲县今年插秧时节耕牛发生口蹄疫，经某部兽医院六昼夜的紧张工作，抢救了五百八十多条耕牛。解放军结合医疗工作还向各族人民宣传改善环境卫生，预防疾病。西双版纳傣族自治区的新、老洒房寨，注意整理室内和环境卫生，每星期大扫除一次，患病的人已经减少。
    边疆各族人民热爱解放军，军民间已建立了深厚的友谊。在西双版纳，每当部队调离驻地时，傣族妇女们按民族习俗，在战士们手腕上拴上红线，祝福他们健康。每逢过年节的时候，各族人民常常翻山越岭送给部队战士各种礼品、锦旗和慰问信。去年，红河南岸大瑶山各族人民做一面锦旗送给部队，送去两次认为不能表达他们的心意，又取回来重做，最后由苗族赵大妈在锦旗上精心绣上两只和平鸽，结上两个美丽的花球，才吹起芦笙、笛子欢天喜地的送去。　（新华社）
