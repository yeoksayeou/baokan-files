Jiangxi, Yunnan and other places
Grain and cotton harvests are in sight

    In most parts of Jiangxi Province, cotton seedlings have generally blossomed and produced bolls, and a bumper harvest is in sight. In Yangsi Township, Second District, Fengcheng County, cotton plants are generally about two chi (Chinese foot, about 1/3 meter) tall, and are now blossoming and producing bolls. In Xingsheng Agricultural Cooperative, Zhaobu Township, Fourth District, Jinxian County, forty mu (Chinese acre, about 1/15 hectare) of cotton planted using advanced Soviet experience have seedlings that are generally more than two chi six cun (Chinese inch, about 1/30 meter) tall. The most productive plant has about seventy bolls, and most have sixty or so. Based on the cotton boll production in the past two years, the cooperative members predict that each mu will yield at least 200 jin (Chinese pound, about 1/2 kilogram) of ginned cotton this year.

    Although the cotton seedlings did not grow very well due to the excessive rain in spring and summer, after the cotton farmers actively protected and managed them, the cotton growth has taken a sharp turn for the better since July. At present, the cotton farmers are continuing to strengthen field management in order to obtain a better harvest.

    In the rural areas of Yunnan in mid-August, bountiful crops of rice and dryland crops are growing everywhere in the mountainous and plain areas, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

    In Simao Prefecture's Simao and other five counties and Mengzi Prefecture's Yuanjiang County, Honghe Hani Autonomous Region's Yuanyang and Jinping, and Eshan Yi Autonomous Region and other places, 200,000 mu of early rice has been harvested, with an average increase of more than 10%. For example, the Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Puer County harvested an average of 900 jin of rice per mu, an increase of 30% over last year. The mid-season rice in the province is nearing maturity, and most of the late-season rice seedlings cover the fields, with some beginning to bud and spike. The farmers are weeding and cultivating the rice fields. Generally, they have weeded twice, and some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have weeded three or four times. Top dressing has also been applied to the rice fields. Agricultural production cooperatives in Yiliang, Yuxi, Qujing and other places with the highest rice production have also used chemical fertilizers and insecticides. The characteristics of this year's seedling growth are generally high seedling frames and large clumps. The rice that has already spiked has long, large heads. The Wenquan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yiliang County estimates that it will increase production by 13.8% compared to last year.

    Farmers in the mountainous areas have also strengthened the work of "fighting against beasts and preventing disasters" to protect the corn that is about to be harvested. Various places are stepping up the field management of flue-cured tobacco. According to a survey in Huaning County, the early-planted flue-cured tobacco will increase production by 100% compared to last year. This year, the area planted with double-cropping rice in the province has increased by 5% to 10% compared to last year.

    At present, Party committees and people's governments at all levels in the province are leading farmers to thoroughly implement the patriotic production increase plan, carry out mid-tillage and summer hoeing, fight disasters and protect seedlings, and make the greatest efforts to overfulfill the production increase plan.

    江西、云南等地
    粮食棉花丰收在望
    江西省大部地区的棉苗，已普遍开花结桃，丰收在望。丰城县二区杨泗乡棉株一般高二尺上下，现已开花结桃。进贤县四区赵埠乡星胜农业社采用苏联先进经验播种的四十亩棉花，棉苗普遍有二尺六寸多高，棉桃最多的一棵有七十来个，一般都有六十来个，社员们根据过去两年棉花结桃情况，预测今年每亩起码要收皮棉二百斤。
    今年春、夏多雨，棉苗生长虽不很好，但经过棉农积极保护管理，自七月份以来，棉花生长急转良好。目前棉农们正继续加强田间管理，争取获得更好的收成。×××
    八月中旬的云南农村，在山区和平坝地区到处成长着丰盈的水旱庄稼，丰收在望。
    在思茅专区思茅等五县和蒙自专区的元江县，红河哈尼族自治区的元阳、金平，以及峨山县彝族自治区等地的二十万亩早稻已收割完毕，普遍增产一成以上。如普洱县燎原农业生产合作社每亩稻田平均收获量为九百斤，比去年增产百分之三十。全省中稻已接近成熟，绝大多数晚稻苗棵铺满了田野，其中有的开始含苞吐穗，农民们正在田里薅秧、闯谷花。一般已薅了两道，有的农业生产合作社和互助组已薅了三、四道；稻田还施了一道追肥，在产水稻最多的宜良、玉溪、曲靖等地的农业生产合作社还使用了化学肥料和除虫药剂。今年苗棵成长的特点，一般苗架高、发丛大，已抽穗的水稻则吊吊长，穗头大。宜良县温泉农业生产合作社估计将比去年增产百分之十三点八。
    山区的农民还加强了“打兽防灾”的工作，保住了即将收割的玉米。各地正加紧烤烟的田间管理，据华宁县调查，栽得早的烤烟将比去年增产一倍。今年全省种二季稻的面积已比去年增加了百分之五到百分之十。
    目前，全省各级党委和人民政府正领导农民深入执行爱国增产计划，开展中耕夏锄，抗灾保苗，尽最大的努力争取超额完成增产计划。　（荣隆）
