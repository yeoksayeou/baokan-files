    Speech by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej at the Celebration of the Tenth Anniversary of Romania's Liberation in Bucharest (Abstract)
    Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic, delivered a speech on August 22nd at the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Romania by the heroic Soviet army in Bucharest.
    Gheorghiu-Dej said that today we are here to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the liberation of our motherland by the heroic Soviet army. Ten years ago today, the patriotic forces of the people, led and organized by the Romanian Communist Party, overthrew the fascist dictatorship and opened a new era in the historical development of Romania.
    For centuries, the blood of the people fighting for freedom has stained the land of our motherland. The heroic sons and daughters of the people have more than once defeated the invaders who oppressed and plundered Romania. But each time the country was repeatedly occupied by foreigners, because the exploiting classes were always preparing to sell out the independence of the country. After shaking off the chains of Turkey, it was then chained by Western imperialists.
    The extent to which the Romanian ruled by the bourgeoisie and landlords was enslaved by imperialist monopoly capital can be illustrated by the following facts: foreign capital accounted for 91.9% of the petroleum industry, 74% of the metallurgical industry, 95% of natural gas and electricity production, 72% of the chemical industry, and 70% of the timber industry. The collusion of the Romanian bourgeoisie and landlords with German fascist imperialism further enslaved the country, plundered the national wealth to a greater extent, and pushed Romania onto the path of the criminal anti-Soviet war.
    Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that ten years ago, the economic characteristics of Romania were underdeveloped industry and backward agriculture. Imperialist monopoly capital had turned Romania into its agricultural appendage and supplier of raw materials. Gheorghiu-Dej continued: Such an era is gone forever. August 23rd is the great national day of the Romanian people, because this day marks a fundamental change in the life of the Romanian people: from a system of bourgeoisie and landlords—a system of oppression and barbaric exploitation of the working people, from a system in which the country suffered political and economic enslavement by imperialist powers to a people's democratic system. Under the people's democratic system, the liberated people have taken the fate of the country into their own hands, and they have become the only and true masters of the country.
    Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej said that the period after August 23, 1944, was a magnificent period in history. The working class, inspired by a huge revolutionary upsurge, became the leading force of the people. Under the banner of the working class's party, millions of working people in urban and rural areas joined the struggle.
    The bourgeoisie-landlord reactionaries' conspiracy to separate the peasants from the working class was crushed and defeated. The Party mobilized the working class to help the peasants and assist them in seizing the landlords' land by revolutionary means and distributing it to landless and land-poor peasants. The establishment of the worker-peasant alliance determined the future of the struggle for power: the democratic government was established on March 6, 1945, with the working class playing a leading role in this government.
    The reactionaries' repeated conspiracies to undermine the democratic system and attempt to restore the old order were crushed by the struggle of the masses. The struggle to expose, isolate, and crush the reactionary bourgeoisie-landlord parties continued until the end, and on December 30, 1947, the monarchy was abolished and the Romanian People's Republic was proclaimed.
    The Soviet Union's historic victory in World War II created conditions for our people to take their destiny into their own hands and establish a social and state system that conforms to the will of the people.
    Therefore, today, as we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the liberation of our motherland, we, the Romanian people, deeply thank the great Soviet people who liberated us, and thank the glorious Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government.
    After overthrowing the monarchy and proclaiming the establishment of the Romanian People's Republic, our Party and government began to implement the nationalization of the main means of production and the banking system of industry and transportation. As a result, a powerful socialist component emerged in our national economy, in which the new, socialist relations of production were adapted to the nature of the productive forces. In the socialist component, capitalist economic laws no longer apply, replaced by new laws inherent in the socialist system, such as the basic economic law of socialism and the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy.
    Thus, the period of building the socialist economic foundation of our country began. During this period, economic development was carried out under the conditions of the coexistence of three economic components—the socialist component, the private capitalist component, and the small commodity production component. The socialist component was fighting against the capitalist component. In the process of struggle, through socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, as well as bringing small commodity production into the socialist orbit, the socialist component in the national economy was developed and continuously consolidated. The way to build a socialist economic foundation is to continuously expand the socialist form in various sectors of the national economy. The economic policy of the Party and government is based on the basic economic law of socialism, and its purpose is to continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of our working people.
    In the era of the people's regime, socialist industry has been widely developed. In 1949, industrial production reached the pre-war level, and in recent years it has greatly exceeded this level: in 1953, industrial production had increased to two and a half times that of 1938. At the same time, the proportion of the socialist component in industry continued to increase, and it now accounts for about 99%, while the capitalist component in industry has dropped to 1%. That is to say, the question of who will win in industry has been completely and thoroughly resolved—socialism has won.
    In the first few years of implementing a planned economy (1949-1953), the proportion of the production of means of production greatly increased. From 1954 onwards, according to the resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party in August 1953, the speed of development of consumer goods production will catch up with the speed of development of the production of means of production. The same is true of the 1955 line.
    During this period, in addition to the vigorous development of the original industrial sectors, our country established new industrial sectors. The technical foundation of our industry has been consolidated and expanded, and it is now able to produce a large part of the machines, equipment, and hardware daily necessities needed by our country. At present, the production capacity of our machine-building industry has made it possible to supply most of the equipment and linkage machines necessary for the petroleum industry and the coal mining industry.
    Of particular significance is that our machine-building industry has the capacity to supply agriculture with a large part of the necessary agricultural machinery and farm implements.
    Due to the expansion of existing enterprises and the establishment of new enterprises in heavy industry, the food industry, and light industry, there is a huge potential to greatly increase the production of consumer goods. In order to expand the production of consumer goods and to improve the living standards of the working people, the use of this potential is an urgent task.
    Gheorghiu-Dej said that by the end of 1953, socialist industry produced more than 9 million tons of oil a year, about one and a half times that of 1938, produced about 6 million tons of coal, twice that of 1938, 720,000 tons of steel, two and a half times that of 1938, 450,000 tons of pig iron, about three and a half times that of 1938, 3.4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, three times that of 1938, and 3.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas, more than ten times that of 1938.
    The consumer goods industry produced two and a half times as much cotton yarn and cotton fabrics as in 1938, about two and a half times as much woolen fabrics, more than twice as many leather shoes, and two and a half times as much glassware.
    The food industry produced more than six times as much macaroni products as in 1938, about three and a half times as much vegetable oil, 1.1 times as much sugar, and about four times as much soap. In the past four years, new and powerful enterprises have been established in various production departments, and old enterprises have also been equipped with new machines.
    The technical assistance of the Soviet Union and cooperation with people's democratic countries have made it possible for our industry to be equipped with highly technical equipment. On this basis, labor productivity in industry in 1953 increased by 38% compared with 1950.
    Gheorghiu-Dej continued: Today, our agriculture has three components: the socialist component, the small commodity production component, and the capitalist component. Since 1949, the socialist component in agriculture has been continuously increasing, and it now accounts for more than 20% of the country's cultivated land area. In these years, the working peasants have voluntarily formed 2,048 collective farms, with a total land area of 850,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare), and 2,384 mutual aid teams, with a total land area of more than 270,000 hectares. The harvests of state farms, collective farms, and mutual aid teams are higher than those of the individual economies of working peasants.
    Gheorghiu-Dej said that the main efforts of the Party and government are to eliminate the backwardness of agriculture and increase the production of daily necessities, so as to improve the living standards of the working people. The draft instructions of the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party on developing agriculture in the next two or three years stipulate measures to identify and reclaim all unused land, so that the country's cultivated land area can be increased to 10 million hectares in 1956.
    The instructions also recommend consolidating collective farms and mutual aid teams organizationally, economically, and politically. It also stipulates that investment in the development of agriculture and animal husbandry will be increased, about 3 billion lei (Romanian currency) in 1955 and about 4 billion lei in 1956.
    All plans for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry are based on the principle of caring for the material interests of producers, so that after they have fulfilled their obligations to the state to deliver and fulfill the producer contract, they can sell their surplus products on the market.
    Gheorghiu-Dej continued that the state's implementation of the monopoly of foreign trade is of particular significance to Romania's economic development. In recent years, the volume of foreign trade has greatly increased, especially trade with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries has expanded. Trade treaties and trade agreements have now been signed with more than 40 capitalist countries. The Romanian People's Republic is willing to develop trade with any country on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit. Since the implementation of nationalization in 1948, national income has been increasing year by year, and in 1953 national income had increased to more than twice that of 1948.
    The distribution of national income has also undergone fundamental changes. Now the vast majority of national income is used to benefit the working people: directly, it is expressed as their personal income, and indirectly, it is expressed as financial allocations for the development of the national economy and for social and cultural undertakings. In all aspects of economic construction, we rely on the invaluable assistance of the Soviet Union.
    The Soviet Union's fraternal assistance to our socialist construction is a noble example of proletarian internationalism and an example of the new type of relationship established between socialist countries.
    Gheorghiu-Dej continued, all socialist production in our country is subordinate to the supreme goal of the people's democratic system—to create a happy life for the people. In the ten years since the liberation of our country, the material and cultural living standards of the working people in urban and rural areas have greatly improved. Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that since the establishment of the people's regime, science, culture, and art have also developed rapidly.
    Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that the achievements made by our people in all departments in these ten years are the result of the heroic labor of our working class, working peasants, and intellectuals, and are the result of the great development of the creativity of the people who have become masters of their own destiny. In summarizing the great achievements of the Romanian people and various ethnic minorities, we are also aware of the magnitude of the tasks facing us. Resolutely consolidating the worker-peasant alliance was and still is the primary task of the Party and government.
    We must mobilize all our forces to implement the plans for various measures to greatly increase agricultural production in the next two or three years, as stipulated in the draft instructions to be discussed at the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party.
    We must ensure that there are large quantities of agricultural and livestock products in order to better supply the working people with food and to supply industry with raw materials. We must work tirelessly to further develop industrial production, to fulfill the tasks of the Five-Year Plan in accordance with various indicators, and to increase labor productivity in various work departments.
    It is necessary to continuously consolidate and expand trade between urban and rural areas, improve the work of our state-owned and cooperative commerce, and develop domestic trade.
    Our task also lies in: continuously strengthening the people's democratic regime; ensuring strict observance of people's laws; striving to improve and streamline state organs; improving the work of state organs in order to eradicate bureaucracy; and tirelessly raising revolutionary vigilance against the enemies of the working people.
    One of the sources of strength of the People's Democratic Romania is the brotherly friendship between the Romanian people and ethnic minorities. We will always unswervingly implement the Leninist-Stalinist national policy, continuously consolidate the friendly ties between all the working people of the Romanian People's Republic (regardless of which ethnic group they belong to), and resolutely fight against chauvinism and bourgeois nationalism tendencies; educate the working masses with the spirit of fraternal unity of the working people of all nationalities and the spirit of proletarian internationalism; strengthen the unity of the working people of the Romanian People's Republic and fight for the prosperity of the motherland.
    Further consolidating the Party—the leader of the people in the struggle to build socialism and improve welfare—is the guarantee for the victorious realization of the major tasks facing us. The reason why our working people have been able to achieve all these achievements in the past ten years is because the people are led by a party that follows the Marxist-Leninist doctrine and the historical experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism, its ranks are inextricably united and maintain close ties with the masses, and its policies reflect the vital interests and heartfelt aspirations of the working people.
    When Gheorghiu-Dej talked about foreign policy, he said: The Romanian People's Republic, like other countries in the democratic camp, takes the principle of peaceful coexistence of two systems as a guide. Mutual cooperation, strengthening economic ties, and cultural exchanges in the cause of defending peace are the realistic foundations that can and should be based on in the current international relations system. The Soviet Union's proposal on organizing European collective security is a concrete embodiment of the principle of peaceful coexistence of two systems.
    The US aggressive bloc is constantly taking various provocative actions against the Soviet Union, People's China, and various people's democratic countries, and annually allocates large amounts of funds to subsidize sabotage activities in these countries. Its actions violate the most basic norms of international law and are unprecedented in the history of relations between independent sovereign states.
    Speaking of Romania, the matter is this: The US rulers, who call themselves "republican supporters," are accustomed to annually cursing the Romanian people for expelling the Hohenzollern dynasty, which, as everyone knows, faithfully served the interests of international capital.
    Only those who have lost their sense of reality would dream of putting such shackles on the Romanian people and the people of other countries who have forever freed themselves from the shackles of capitalist enslavement, and of benefiting the US monopoly capitalists and their lackeys such as the Hohenzollern group under their wings. The Romanian people realize that they are an integral part of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and this understanding is a source of strength, cultivating perseverance, and full of confidence in the future for them.
    The Romanian people regard the unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union as a guarantee of success in the struggle for the victory of socialism and as a guarantee of the independence and freedom of our motherland. Our people will strengthen the friendship between the Romanian People's Republic and the Soviet Union, strengthen the brotherly friendship between the Romanian people and their liberators and friends—the Soviet people. Our people will also strengthen the brotherly friendship with People's China and various people's democratic countries.
    The peaceful policy pursued by the Romanian government and the policy of cooperating with all countries regardless of political system are a natural reflection and logical development of the government's policy of peaceful construction at home and creating a happy life for the people.
    Today, anyone in our country who hopes for peace, loves their motherland, and expects its prosperity and happiness will see the results of this foreign policy. Romania has never had as many friends as it does now. On the tenth anniversary of Romania's liberation, we assure all friends of Romania, first of all, the Soviet people, our liberators, and the people of various people's democratic countries: We will stand unswervingly in our respective posts, and we will actively participate with full determination in the struggle of the people of all countries for peace and democracy, and for the victory of the principles of brotherly cooperation between all countries.
    Long live August 23rd—the great day of our motherland's liberation!
    May the Romanian People's Republic prosper, long live the Romanian People's Republic!
    Long live the Romanian Workers' Party, the leader and organizer of all the victories of the Romanian people!
    Long live the government of the Romanian People's Republic!
    Long live the eternal Romanian-Soviet friendship!
    Long live the great Soviet Union, the liberator and friend of our country!
    Long live the great and indestructible democratic and socialist camp!
    Long live international peace! (Stormy and lasting applause, all stand up).

    在布加勒斯特举行的罗马尼亚解放十周年庆祝大会上
    乔治乌——德治的讲话（摘要）
    罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席格·乔治乌—德治，八月二十二日在布加勒斯特举行的罗马尼亚解放十周年庆祝大会上发表了讲话。
    乔治乌—德治说，今天我们来庆祝英勇的苏联军队解放我们祖国十周年。十年前的今天，罗马尼亚共产党所领导和组织的人民爱国力量推翻了法西斯独裁统治，开创了罗马尼亚历史发展上的一个新时代。
      数百年来，为自由而战的人民的鲜血染红了我们祖国的大地。英勇的人民的儿女不止一次地战胜了压迫和掠夺罗马尼亚的侵略者。但是每一次国家都一再被外国人所强占，因为剥削阶级无时无刻地不在准备着出卖国家的独立。摆脱了土耳其的锁链之后，接着就带上了西方帝国主义者的锁链。
    帝国主义垄断资本对资产阶级和地主统治的罗马尼亚的奴役到什么程度，由这样一个事实就可以得到说明：外国资本在石油工业中占百分之九十一点九，冶金工业中占百分之七十四，在天然瓦斯和电力生产方面占百分之九十五，化学工业中占百分之七十二，木材工业中占百分之七十等。罗马尼亚的资产阶级和地主与德国法西斯帝国主义的勾结使国家受到更大的奴役，使国家财富遭到更大的掠夺，并把罗马尼亚推上了罪恶的反苏战争的道路。
    乔治乌—德治指出：十年前，罗马尼亚的经济特征是工业不发达和农业落后，帝国主义垄断资本把罗马尼亚变成了自己的农业附庸和原料的供应国。乔治乌—德治接着说：这样的时代是一去不复返了。八月二十三日是罗马尼亚人民的伟大的国庆节，因为这一天标志着罗马尼亚人民生活中发生了根本的变化：由资产阶级、地主的制度——压迫和野蛮地剥削劳动人民群众的制度，由国家遭受帝国主义列强的政治奴役和经济奴役的制度变成了人民民主制度。在人民民主制度下，解放了的人民把国家的命运掌握在自己手中，他们并且成为国家唯一的、真正的主人。　格·乔治乌—德治说，一九四四年八月二十三日以后的这段时期，是历史上轰轰烈烈的时期，由巨大的革命高潮鼓舞起来的工人阶级，成了人民的领导力量。在工人阶级的政党的旗帜下，千千万万城市和农村的劳动人民加入了斗争。
    资产阶级—地主反动派想使农民脱离工人阶级的阴谋被粉碎了，被打下去了。党动员工人阶级帮助农民，协助他们以革命的手段夺取了地主的土地，分配给无地和少地的农民。工农联盟的建立决定了争取政权的斗争的前途：一九四五年三月六日民主政府成立了，工人阶级在这个政府中起着领导的作用。
    反动派屡次破坏民主制度和企图复辟的阴谋，都被人民群众的斗争粉碎了。揭穿、孤立和粉碎反动的资产阶级—地主政党的斗争一直进行到最后，在一九四七年十二月三十日废除了君主制度，宣告了罗马尼亚人民共和国的成立。
    苏联在第二次世界大战中获得的历史性胜利为我们创造了条件，使我们人民能够把自己的命运掌握在自己的手中，并建立起符合人民意志的社会制度和国家制度。
    因此在今天，当我们庆祝我们祖国解放十周年的时候，我们罗马尼亚人民深深感谢解放我们的伟大的苏联人民，感谢光荣的苏联共产党和苏联政府。
    在推翻了君主制度以及在罗马尼亚人民共和国宣告成立后，我们党和政府就开始实行工业、运输的主要生产资料和银行系统的国有化。这一来，我们国民经济中就产生了强大的社会主义成分，在这种成分中，新的、社会主义的生产关系是和生产力的性质相适应的。在社会主义成分中，资本主义经济法则不再发生作用，代替它的是社会主义制度所固有的新的法则，如社会主义的基本经济法则和国民经济有计划、按比例发展的法则。
    于是，我国建设社会主义经济基础的时期开始了。在这段时期中，经济发展是在三种经济成分——社会主义成分、私人资本主义成分和小商品生产成分——并存的条件下进行的。社会主义成分在和资本主义成分进行着斗争。在斗争的过程当中，通过社会主义工业化和农业的社会主义改造，以及把小商品生产纳入社会主义轨道，国民经济中的社会主义成分得到了发展和不断巩固。建设社会主义经济基础的途径是不断扩大国民经济各部门中的社会主义形式。党和政府的经济政策是以社会主义基本经济法则为基础的，它的目的是不断提高我国劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平。
    在人民政权的年代里，社会主义工业得到了广泛的发展。一九四九年工业生产达到了战前水平，而最近几年又大大超过了这个水平：一九五三年工业生产已增为一九三八年的两倍半。同时，工业中的社会主义成分的比重继续不断增长，它到现在已约占百分之九十九的比例，而工业中的资本主义成分已降到百分之一。这就是说，工业中谁战胜谁的问题已完全彻底解决了——社会主义已经获得了胜利。
    实行计划经济的头几年（一九四九—一九五三年）生产资料生产的比重大大地增长了。从一九五四年起，根据罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会一九五三年八月全体会议的决议，消费品生产发展的速度将赶上生产资料生产发展的速度。一九五五年的路线也是这样。
    在这段时期中，除了原有的工业部门得到大力发展以外，我国建立了新的工业部门。我国工业的技术基础巩固和扩大了，它现在已有能力生产我国所需的很大一部分机器、装备和五金日用品。现在，我国机器制造工业的生产能力已有可能供给石油工业和采煤工业所必需的大部分装备和联动机。
    具有特别意义的是：我们的机器制造工业有能力供给农业以很大一部分必需的农业机器和农具。
    由于重工业、食品工业和轻工业中原有企业的扩展和新企业的建立，有了巨大的潜力来大力增加消费品的生产。为了扩大消费品的生产，为了提高劳动人民的生活水平，这种潜力的使用是一项迫不及待的任务。
    乔治乌—德治说，到一九五三年底，社会主义工业一年生产九百多万吨石油，约为一九三八年的一倍半，生产约六百万吨煤，为一九三八年的两倍，七十二万吨钢，为一九三八年的两倍半，四十五万吨生铁，约为一九三八年的三倍半，三十四亿瓩时的电力，为一九三八年的三倍，三十五亿立方公尺的天然瓦斯，为一九三八年的十倍多。
    消费品工业生产的棉纱和棉织品为一九三八年的两倍半，毛织品约两倍半，皮鞋两倍多，玻璃制品两倍半。
    食品工业生产的通心粉制品增为一九三八年的六倍多，植物油约三倍半，糖一点一倍，肥皂约四倍。最近四年来生产各部门都建立了新的强大企业，旧的企业也装备了新机器。
    苏联的技术援助以及与人民民主国家的合作使我国工业有可能用高度的技术装备起来。在这个基础上，一九五三年工业中的劳动生产率比一九五零年提高了百分之三十八。
    乔治乌—德治继续说：今天，我们的农业有三种成分：社会主义成分、小商品生产成分和资本主义成分。从一九四九年开始，农业中社会主义的成分不断在增加，现在占全国耕地面积百分之二十以上。在这些年代中，劳动农民在自愿的基础上组成了两千零四十八个集体农庄，土地总面积为八十五万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩），并组成两千三百八十四个共耕社，土地总面积为二十七万余公顷。国营农场、集体农庄和共耕社的收成都比劳动农民的个体经济为高。
    乔治乌—德治说，党和政府主要的努力是消除农业的落后现象和增加日用品的生产，以提高劳动人民的生活水平。罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会关于在最近两三年内发展农业的指示草案，规定了查明和开垦所有尚未使用的土地的措施，以使全国耕地面积在一九五六年能增加到一千万公顷。
    指示还建议在组织上、经济上和政治上巩固集体农庄和共耕社。并规定增加发展农业和畜牧业的投资，一九五五年约为三十亿列伊（罗币名），一九五六年约为四十亿列伊。
    发展农业和畜牧业的一切计划都以这样一个原则为基础：关心生产者的物质利益，以便使他们在向国家履行了义务交售和履行了生产者定购合同之后，可以把自己需要之外的多余产品在市场上出卖。
    乔治乌—德治接着说，国家实行对外贸易的垄断，对罗马尼亚的经济发展有特别重大的意义。最近几年来，对外贸易额大大增加，特别是和苏联以及各人民民主国家的贸易扩大了。现在已和四十多个资本主义国家签订了贸易条约和贸易协定。罗马尼亚人民共和国愿意在完全平等和互利的条件下和任何一个国家开展贸易。自从一九四八年实行国有化之后，国民收入一年一年地在增加，一九五三年的国民收入已增为一九四八年的两倍以上。
    国民收入的分配也发生了根本的变化。现在国民收入的绝大部都是用在为劳动人民谋福利上：直接的表现就是他们的个人收入，间接的表现就是发展国民经济和用在社会、文化事业方面的财政拨款。在经济建设的各方面，我们都依靠苏联的不可估价的援助。
    苏联对我国社会主义建设事业的兄弟援助是无产阶级国际主义精神的崇高范例，是社会主义阵营各国之间确立的新型的关系的范例。
    乔治乌—德治接着说道，我国的一切社会主义生产服从于人民民主制度的最高目的——创造人民的幸福生活。我国解放十年来，城乡劳动人民的物质文化生活水平大大地提高了。乔治乌—德治接着指出，自从人民政权建立以来，科学、文化和艺术也得到了迅速的发展。
    乔治乌—德治指出，我国人民在这十年当中，在所有各部门的活动中所取得的成绩是我国工人阶级，劳动农民和知识分子英勇劳动的成果，是已经成为自己命运主人的人民的创造力得到巨大的发挥的结果。在总结罗马尼亚人民和各少数民族所获得的巨大成就时，我们也意识到摆在我们面前的任务的重大。坚决不渝地巩固工农联盟，过去是现在仍然是党和政府的首要任务。
    我们必须动员一切力量去实现即将在罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会上讨论的指示草案中所规定的在最近两、三年内大大提高农业生产的各项措施计划。
    我们应当保证有大量的农产品和畜产品以便更好地供应劳动人民以食粮，供应工业以原料。我们应当不倦地努力，争取进一步发展工业生产，争取按照各项指标完成五年计划任务，争取提高各个工作部门的劳动生产率。
    必须不断地巩固和扩大城乡之间的贸易，改进我们的国营和合作社商业的工作，发展国内贸易。
    我们的任务还在于：不断加强人民民主政权；保证严格遵守人民法律；争取改善和精简国家机关；改善国家机关工作以便铲除官僚主义；并不倦地提高对劳动人民的敌人的革命警惕性。
    人民民主罗马尼亚的力量的泉源之一，就是罗马尼亚人民和少数民族之间的兄弟友谊。我们将始终不渝地执行列宁—斯大林的民族政策，不断巩固罗马尼亚人民共和国全体劳动人民（不问他们属于哪个民族）之间的友谊联系，并十分坚决地同沙文主义和资产阶级的民族主义倾向作斗争；以各民族劳动人民友爱团结的精神和无产阶级国际主义精神教育劳动群众；加强罗马尼亚人民共和国劳动人民的团结，为祖国的繁荣而斗争。
    进一步巩固党——人民为建成社会主义和增进福利而斗争的领导者，就是胜利地实现我们面临的重大任务的保障。我们劳动人民在过去十年中之所以能够取得这一切成就，这是因为领导人民的是这样一个党，它遵循着马克思列宁主义学说和苏联建成社会主义的历史经验，它的队伍是牢不可破地团结一致并和人民群众保持着密切的联系，它的政策反映了劳动人民的切身利益和衷心愿望。
    乔治乌—德治讲到外交政策问题时说：罗马尼亚人民共和国和其他民主阵营的国家一样，是以两种制度可以和平共处的原则为指针的。在保卫和平事业中相互合作、加强经济联系和文化交流，这就是当前国际关系体系中可以而且应当依据的现实基础。苏联关于组织欧洲集体安全的建议是两种制度可以和平共处这一原则的具体体现。
    美国侵略集团不断采取各种挑衅活动反对苏联、人民中国和各人民民主国家，每年都拨出大量的款项资助在这些国家中进行破坏活动，它的行动违背最起码的国际法准则，在独立主权国家关系史上是没有先例的。
    谈到罗马尼亚，事情是这样：自命为“共和制拥护者”的美国执政者们习以为常地每年都漫骂罗马尼亚人民驱逐了霍亨索伦王朝，大家知道，这个王朝是忠实为国际资本利益服务的。
    只有丧失现实感的人才会梦想再给罗马尼亚人民和永远摆脱了资本主义奴役枷锁的其他国家人民套上这种枷锁，而为美国垄断资本家和在他们卵翼下的霍亨索伦集团之类的仆从谋利。罗马尼亚人民认识到：他们是以苏联为首的伟大社会主义阵营的一个组成部分，这种认识对于他们就是产生力量、培养坚忍不拔精神和对前途满怀信心的泉源。
    罗马尼亚人民把和苏联结成的牢不可破的友谊看成是在为社会主义胜利斗争中取得成就的保证，是我们祖国的独立和自由的保证。我国人民今后还要加强罗马尼亚人民共和国和苏联之间的友谊，加强罗马尼亚人民和他们的解放者和朋友——苏联人民之间的兄弟友谊。我国人民还要加强和人民中国以及各人民民主国家的兄弟友谊。
    罗马尼亚政府所执行的和平政策以及不问政治制度如何而与各国合作的政策，就是政府在国内实行的和平建设和为人民创造幸福生活的政策的自然而然的反映和合乎逻辑的发展。
    今天，在我国只要是希望和平、热爱自己祖国并期望着它的繁荣和幸福的人就会看到这种外交政策的成果。罗马尼亚还从来没有过像现在这样多的朋友。在罗马尼亚解放十周年的时候，我们向罗马尼亚的所有的朋友们保证，首先是向我们的解放者苏联人民以及各人民民主国家的人民保证：我们将毫不动摇地站在我们的职责所在的岗位上，我们将以充分的决心积极地参加各国人民为和平和民主，为各国人民兄弟合作的原则的胜利而进行的斗争。
    八月二十三日——我们祖国解放的伟大的日子万岁！
    祝罗马尼亚人民共和国繁荣，罗马尼亚人民共和国万岁！
    罗马尼亚人民一切胜利的领导者和组织者——罗马尼亚工人党万岁！
