The grain departments in Anhui Province have basically ensured the safety of all stored grain during the past three months of rainy weather. The amount of rainfall in Huizhou Prefecture in May and June was very heavy, but because the staff of the grain warehouses had made adequate preparations in advance, no grain was lost. Wuhu City raised the warehouse floor three times during the floods, and none of the grain was affected by dampness. Many places transferred grain stored in low-lying areas to higher ground. According to statistics from July 12 to 25, more than 100 million jin of grain were moved from low-lying areas, ensuring that most of the province's stored grain was kept in safe areas. Whenever warehouses were hit by heavy rain, local Party and government organs, as well as the broad masses of workers and peasants, actively participated in rescue efforts, preventing grain losses.

At present, the grain departments in various parts of the province are further strengthening close ties with flood control, meteorological, transportation and other departments, clarifying the situation warehouse by warehouse, continuing to transport grain stored in low-lying areas to higher ground, and doing a good job in preventing mildew and insects, striving to ensure the safety of stored grain during the flood season.

    安徽省粮食部门在阴雨期间
    努力保证了库存粮食安全
    安徽各地粮食部门在近三个月来的阴雨期间，基本上保证了所有库存粮食的安全。徽州专区五、六月份雨量很大，但因粮食仓库工作人员事前准备工作比较充分，粮食没有损失。芜湖市在洪水期间把仓底垫高了三次，粮食全都没有受潮。不少地方把低洼地区的储粮往高地转移了，据七月十二日到二十五日的统计，从低处搬出的粮食有一亿多斤，使全省大部分的库存粮食保管在安全地带。各地每当仓库受到暴雨侵袭时，当地党、政机关和广大工人、农民都积极抢救，使粮食避免了损失。
    目前全省各地粮食部门更进一步加强和防汛、气象、交通运输等部门的密切联系，逐仓摸清情况，继续把存在低洼地区的粮食运往高地，并做好防霉、防虫工作，争取存粮安全渡过汛期。（新华社）
