Thanks to the help of the Chinese and Soviet people and peace-loving people of the world, and the united efforts of the Vietnamese people themselves, we have achieved a major victory in restoring peace in Indochina. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and in my own name, to the people and government of the People's Republic of China, who have consistently supported us in our struggle against resistance and for the restoration of peace.

In the future, the struggle to consolidate peace, achieve reunification, and complete independence and democracy in our country will be arduous and difficult. We believe that the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China will give us even greater support and encouragement.

We are willing to make greater efforts to consolidate the fraternal unity with the great Chinese people and to contribute our strength to defending peace in Asia and the world.

I wish you good health, Comrade Chairman.
