Dear Vice Premier, dear comrades and friends:

　　On behalf of the Central People's Government and the people of the People's Republic of China, I extend a warm welcome to you, Comrade Vice Premier, and the government personnel of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam accompanying you. And through you, I extend my highest respect and heartfelt congratulations to the heroic Vietnamese people who have won a great victory in the struggle for national independence and freedom.

　　Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people have persisted in eight years of arduous resistance, demonstrating an unparalleled spirit of heroism and indomitable struggle. This great patriotism and revolutionary heroism has won the admiration and love of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world.

　　At the Geneva Conference, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, based on the consistent peaceful proposition of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, played an important role in striving for the restoration of peace in Indochina. Thanks to the efforts of many national delegations, and overcoming various obstacles from the United States, the Geneva Conference finally reached an agreement. The eagerly awaited ceasefire in Indochina was achieved, and a principled agreement was reached on political issues. This is another major victory for the people of Indochina and peace-loving people all over the world. This victory further eased international tensions; this victory is a major contribution to consolidating world peace and security, and first and foremost to consolidating peace and security in Asia. This victory once again proves that international disputes can be resolved through peaceful negotiation, and that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully. Therefore, people all over the world, especially the people of Asia, are rejoicing for this.

　　The Chinese government and people express their full support for the agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina, and are willing to work together with all relevant countries to ensure the implementation of this agreement.

　　However, the warmongering group in the United States will not be reconciled to the failure of its "policy of strength." During the Geneva Conference and after the Geneva Conference, the words and deeds of the United States indicated that it will continue to maintain and create new tensions in Asia, especially stepping up the use of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang entrenched in Taiwan, using Taiwan as a military springboard to continue its aggression against our country, plotting to organize the so-called "Pacific Anti-Communist Military Group," and attempting to undermine the thorough implementation of the Indochina armistice agreement, in order to undermine peace in Asia and the world. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance against this.

　　Dear Vice Premier, the people of China and Vietnam are historically and geographically closely related. The Chinese people have always sympathized with and cared about the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. I firmly believe that in the days of restored peace, the Vietnamese people will achieve great success in healing the wounds of war and restoring the national economy, and will receive the deep concern and active support of the Chinese people.

　　Your friendly visit to China this time will undoubtedly further consolidate and deepen the friendship and unity between China and Vietnam.

　　Let us shout: Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of China and Vietnam! Long live President Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the Vietnamese people! Long live the forces of peace and democracy headed by the great Soviet Union! Long live world peace!

    周恩来总理在宴会上的欢迎词亲爱的副总理同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府和人民，向您——副总理同志和陪同您前来的越南民主共和国的政府人员表示热烈的欢迎。并通过您向在争取民族的独立和自由的斗争中获得伟大胜利的英勇的越南人民致以崇高的敬意和衷心的祝贺。
    越南人民在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的领导下，坚持了八年的艰苦抗战，表现了无比英勇、坚毅不屈的斗争精神。这种伟大的爱国主义和革命英雄主义的气概获得了中国人民及全世界爱好和平的人民的钦佩和敬爱。
    越南民主共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上，根据越南民主共和国政府一贯的和平主张，在争取恢复印度支那和平中起了重要的作用，由于许多国家代表团的努力，并克服了美国方面的种种阻挠，日内瓦会议终于获致了协议。举世渴望的印度支那的停战得以实现，政治问题获得了原则的协议，这是印度支那人民及全世界爱好和平的人民的又一重大胜利。这一胜利，进一步缓和了国际紧张局势；这一胜利，对巩固世界和平和安全，首先对巩固亚洲的和平和安全是一重大的贡献。这一胜利，再一次证明国际争端是可以通过和平协商获致解决的，不同的社会制度的国家是可以和平共处的。因此全世界人民特别是亚洲人民都为此欢欣鼓舞。
    中国政府和人民对日内瓦会议恢复印度支那和平问题获致的协议，表示完全的支持，并愿意与各有关国家共同努力保障这一协议的实现。
    但是，美国的好战集团是不会甘心它的“实力政策”遭受失败的。在日内瓦会议期间和在日内瓦会议之后，美国的言论和行为，表示它将继续在亚洲保持和制造新的紧张局势，特别是加紧利用盘踞台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮，把台湾作为继续侵略我国的军事跳板，策动组织所谓“太平洋反共军事集团”，并企图破坏印度支那停战协议的彻底实现，以破坏亚洲及世界和平。对此，我们必须保持高度的警惕。
    亲爱的副总理同志，中越两国人民在历史和地理上休戚相关，中国人民对于越南人民的正义斗争，历来是同情和关怀的。我深信，越南人民在恢复和平的日子里，在医治战争创伤和恢复国民经济的工作中，将获得巨大成就，并将得到中国人民的深切关怀和积极支持。
    这次您来中国的友好访问，毫无疑义，将会更进一步地巩固和加深中越两国间的友谊和团结。
    让我们高呼：中越两国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！越南人民的领袖胡志明主席万岁！以伟大的苏联为首的和平民主力量万岁！世界和平万岁！
