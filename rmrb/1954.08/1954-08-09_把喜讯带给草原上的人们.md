On the morning of July 19th, a car sped from Hailar City in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Amugulang in the New Barag Left Banner. In the car sat seven representatives attending the first session of the first People's Congress of the Hulunbuir League. They had just finished their meeting the day before and rushed back to their hometown this morning to participate in the Nadaam Festival.

The car sped across the vast Hulunbuir grassland. Along the way, the representatives were still excited by the joy of discussing the draft constitution these past few days. People's Representative Daolama thought: In the past, our women were often looked down upon. At that time, I had never even seen the Bagada (village head) and Sumuda (district head) of my own Baga (village), and I didn't even know where the Banner government was. Now, an ordinary working woman like myself has been elected as a member of the Banner People's Government, and this year I was also elected as a representative to the League People's Congress, sitting with the League government and the League leader to discuss the national law. What a great change this is! People's Representative Batu was also lost in thought. He thought that he used to be a herdsman, and at that time he regarded labor as a lowly thing, and he was insulted, beaten, and scolded everywhere. He had no political or economic rights. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government did he get rid of poverty and become a person with 192 livestock. Because he worked well, he was elected as a Banner labor model last year, received national awards, and this year he was elected as a people's representative of the League. He is respected everywhere, and labor has become a glorious thing. The representatives were eager to take advantage of the gathering of herdsmen to quickly tell the people of their hometown the good news of the promulgation of the draft constitution. They were extremely happy when they saw the colorful flags flying at the Amugulang Nadaam Festival venue in the distance. The people at the venue also swarmed up to shake hands with the representatives, asking about everything. Some herdsmen even pulled the representatives to drink and eat.

From this day on, the people's representatives launched a publicity campaign. They took advantage of the opportunity for the herdsmen to gather to watch movies at night, and used the gaps between the herdsmen's wrestling and horse racing to report the contents of the draft constitution to everyone. Sometimes they even went from door to door to yurts and tents to promote it.

Many herdsmen were moved after hearing the reports of the people's representatives. Sixty-nine-year-old old lady Tuogetaohao shed tears of excitement after hearing the report. She remembered that there was no hospital in this place in previous years, and she had given birth to many children, none of whom grew up. Now a hospital has been established in the Banner, and the children are growing up very healthy. Her nephew has become a cadre of the People's Government, and even her little niece Daoligeer has become an obstetrician in the Sumu (district) government. She said: "In the past, we had no freedom and no rights. Now it is completely different, and our people all have jobs. I fully support the draft constitution." Baga (village) cadre Lamuseleng said: "I used to be a herdsman, but now I have become a cadre of my own government. Today, the draft constitution has pointed out the direction for us to move forward, and I will have more confidence in my work in the future." The lamas of Dangbu Temple also expressed their support for the draft constitution. Lama Dagewa said: "During the Japanese rule, schools were only allowed to read and use Japanese, but now schools use our Mongolian language and script. Now, the draft constitution stipulates that all ethnic groups have the freedom to develop their own languages and scripts, and it also stipulates freedom of religious belief. We fully support it."

    把喜讯带给草原上的人们
    新华社记者　艾丁、阿·加那斯弟
    七月十九日早晨，一辆汽车由内蒙古自治区的海拉尔市驰往新巴尔虎左翼旗的阿木古郎。车上，坐着七位出席呼伦贝尔盟第一届第一次人民代表大会会议的代表。他们昨天才开完会，这天清早就赶回家乡参加那达慕大会去。
    汽车在辽阔的呼伦贝尔草原上急驶。一路上，代表们仍旧被这几天讨论宪法草案的喜悦所激动。人民代表道拉玛想到：过去我们妇女多被人轻视，那时候我连本巴嘎（村）的巴嘎达（村长）和苏木达（区长）都没见过，旗政府在什么地方也不知道。现在，自己这样一个普通的劳动妇女当选了旗人民政府的委员，今年又当选了盟人民代表大会的代表，到盟政府和盟长坐在一起讨论国家大法，这是多么大的变化呀！人民代表巴图也在沉思着。他想自己过去是一个牧工，那时候把劳动看成卑贱的事，自己到处受侮辱、挨打骂，政治上、经济上没有任何权利。只有在共产党和人民政府的领导下，自己才摆脱了贫困，成了一个有着一百九十二头牲畜的人，因为劳动好，去年被选为旗的劳动模范，受到国家奖励，今年又被选为盟的人民代表，到处受人尊敬，劳动成了光荣的事了。代表们都渴望趁着牧民们聚会的日子，把公布宪法草案的喜讯快些告诉给家乡的人。他们远远看到阿木古郎那达慕大会会场上飘扬着彩色缤纷的旗帜时，都高兴极了。会场上的人也蜂拥而上和代表们握手，问长问短，有的牧民还拉着代表去吃酒、吃饭。
    从这天起，人民代表们就展开了宣传活动。他们趁着晚上牧民聚集起来看电影的机会，利用牧民进行摔跤、赛马的空隙，向大家报告宪法草案的内容，有时还挨门逐户地到蒙古包和帐篷里去宣传。
    很多牧民听到人民代表的报告后，都受到了感动。六十九岁的老太太托格陶好，听了报告后，激动地流泪了。她想起往年这个地方没有医院，自己生了很多孩子，一个也没有长大。现在旗里设立了医院，孩子们都长得很健康，自己的侄儿当上人民政府的干部，连那个小侄女道里格尔也成了苏木
  （区）政府的接生员了。她说：过去我们没有自由、没有权利，现在完全不同了，我们的人都有了工作。我完全拥护宪法草案。巴嘎（村）干部拉木色楞说：我过去是个牧民，现在成了自己政府的干部，今天宪法草案又给我们指出了前进的方向，以后工作更有信心了。当布庙的喇嘛们也表示了对宪法草案的拥护，喇嘛达格瓦说：过去日本统治的时候，学校里只准念日文、用日语，现在学校都用我们蒙古人自己的语言文字了。现在，宪法草案上规定各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由，还规定了宗教信仰自由，我们是完全拥护的。
