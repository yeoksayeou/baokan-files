If You're Willing to Walk, There's a Road
The Story of Comrade You Hui, a Volunteer Army Wounded Soldier Who Lost His Hands and Learned to Write
衛翔

 (I)
 In November 1951, one evening, a heavily wounded Volunteer Army soldier was carried into an air-raid shelter on the front lines in Korea. He had been wounded by enemy aircraft while on his way to perform a task on the front lines. His name was You Hui.
 I don't know how long it was, but when the anesthetic wore off, You Hui awoke from his coma. He immediately felt a sharp pain all over his body. He felt that his right arm was much lighter, and his left arm, head, and face were all wrapped in bandages. A shadow of terror surged into his heart: "My right arm and left eye are completely gone, and only three fingers are left on my left hand. My head and face are also seriously injured. I will become a completely useless person, someone who can only eat but not work. I'm so young..." So he cried bitterly.
 More than ten days later, he returned to his mother's arms from the Korean front – to a hospital in the motherland. The only three fingers he had left were completely ulcerated because of the poisonous emergency bandages made by unscrupulous merchants on the front lines in Korea. His heart seemed to be broken. He thought, "The motherland is even more lovable, but I am finished. A person who can't do anything all day long, who relies entirely on others for eating, dressing, and urinating... what's the point of living?" The pain of his wounds often made him dizzy, but sometimes he would rather grit his teeth and endure the pain than let the doctor treat him.
 "Comrade You Hui, it is an honor for you to be wounded, it is for the cause of the Party, and for the happiness of all mankind. The Party and the people will never forget comrades like you, and will always take care of you. I hope you will not be pessimistic and should recuperate in peace, maintain and carry forward your glory..." This was the first conversation that Instructor Zhao from the hospital had with Comrade You Hui.
 He said: "Instructor, I'm not complaining about becoming disabled, nor do I think it's not an honor to be wounded, and I'm not afraid that the Party and the people won't take care of me. I just think that a young person like me, who is also a member of the Youth League, can't do anything all day long and needs care from others everywhere..."
 After studying You Hui's ideological situation, Instructor Zhao had another long conversation with him the next day. He said to You Hui: "It is unavoidable for a person who has become disabled and lost his health to be sad; but physical disability does not equal a person's disability. For example, you don't have a right arm, and your left eye has also lost its sight, but as long as you can strengthen yourself ideologically, you can still be an excellent propagandist for the Party, an excellent worker for the Youth League, and continue to serve the cause of the Party and the people!..."
 The instructor's words began to touch You Hui's heart. His pessimistic mood gradually lessened, and his injuries gradually improved. At this time, the leadership also specifically introduced him to the Soviet literary masterpiece "How the Steel Was Tempered," asking him to read it. Instructor Zhao also constantly went to talk to him, telling him the story of Meresyev from "A Real Man" who lost his legs and learned to fly a fighter plane. Slowly, his entire mind was occupied by the great heroic images of Pavel and Meresyev. Whenever his unhealthy thoughts were about to rise, he seemed to see a giant paralyzed all over and blind sitting beside him, holding his left arm tightly and saying: "The most precious thing a person has is life. Life is given to us only once. A person's life should be spent like this: When he looks back on the past, he will not regret wasting his years, nor will he be ashamed of his mediocrity."

 (II)
 The idea of living on, living like Pavel, living like Meresyev, gradually became stronger. He first considered how to handle his daily life problems independently. He thought: "I have to ask others to feed me three meals a day, and each meal takes twenty minutes, which means an hour a day. If I live for another thirty years, it will take up more than 10,000 hours of other people's time. If all this time were used for production, how much wealth would it produce for the country!" Thinking of this, he was suddenly taken aback and said to himself, "This is a sin, I can't continue like this!"
 To solve the problem of eating, the only way was to focus on his only left arm. He had raised this arm countless times, but had also lowered it countless times, sometimes full of confidence, sometimes losing courage. One day, he suddenly remembered an old story: when he was a child, he had seen an old teacher in his hometown holding a pen with the bend of his wrist to write. At that time, he was amazed by this. He thought: "Although I don't have hands and can't write like that old teacher, I can tie bandages to the tip of my arm, make two holes in the bandages, and then insert the spoon into the holes, one spoonful, one spoonful... It will work, it will definitely work!"
 The first experiment began. But the spoon's mouth was shallow and the handle was short, making it difficult to bring the food to his mouth as he wished. At the same time, the wound had not fully healed, and it was not convenient to swing his arm. He didn't eat much dinner that day, and most of it was spilled on the table and clothes. The nurse who helped him with the experiment was both sympathetic and anxious, and advised him not to experiment anymore. He resolutely refused.
 "Comrade You Hui," the nurse finally had to say seriously, "Do you have any objections to my work?" This sudden question surprised him. After a pause, he replied: "No, no objections!" "If you have no objections, you should let me feed you, because this is my duty!"...
 Although the experiment failed, he was not discouraged. Every night, after everyone else was asleep, he would find a fellow convalescent who agreed with him, help him tie on the bandages, insert the spoon, and practice lying in the quilt. Once, twice, one day, two days... He didn't know how long it took, but his movements became skillful, his arm no longer ached, and he felt confident. One night, when everyone was asleep again, he used a glass of cold boiled water left over from the daytime as food and drink, and made a practice run. He finished the glass of water in no time and was so happy that he almost jumped up!
 The next morning at breakfast, he asked the nurse several times to let him do the experiment again, and the nurse finally agreed. When the food was smoothly spooned into his mouth, the nurse smiled, and he smiled too. The convalescent comrades in the same room cheered for his victory!
 Since then, he was filled with greater confidence and hope in life, and began to practice putting on his hat, making his bed, sweeping the floor, urinating, carrying water... and other movements.

 (III)
 Life told him that he must continue to move forward and not stop for a moment. News of the achievements of the motherland's construction and the fact that Pavel, who was blind and paralyzed all over, wrote a novel made him feel more and more the meaning of his future life. He thought: "My right eye can still give me light, I must first learn to write!" How to write? Day and night, he was immersed in troubles and hopes. The first time, he practiced writing with the pen in his mouth, but he couldn't get the strength even. If he pressed too lightly, the writing would be blurry; if he pressed too hard, he would either tear the paper or accumulate a large blob of ink. He originally planned to write the five characters "the beginning of the battle," but he only wrote one character "战" (battle) and half of "斗" (fight), the paper was torn, and there were two or three drops of ink next to the character "战". When he tried to continue writing, his teeth began to ache, and as soon as he loosened his mouth, the pen also fell to the ground.
 The failure of the experiment made him a little discouraged, but when he thought of the encouragement from the Party leaders of the hospital: "Roads are made by people walking, as long as you are willing to walk, there will definitely be a road!" He seemed to see hope again. He focused again on his only left arm. He raised this arm and looked at it, and immediately lowered it weakly; as soon as it was lowered, he raised it again. "Can it also undertake the task of writing? Yes! ... No..." Finally, like a child who had discovered something precious, he stared at the place where he inserted the spoon: "Dig two more holes in front of it, a pen... and then... it will rotate regularly on the record like the stylus of a record player..." But the joy was quickly replaced by distress. After writing for more than half an hour, only two crooked characters the size of teacups appeared on the paper, and his arm and body felt sore, his head was dizzy, and his eyes were blurred. Looking at these two unpresentable characters, his whole body trembled uncontrollably.
 When the Party leaders of the hospital learned about this situation, in addition to advising him to pay attention to his health first, they also gave him great encouragement: "As long as you put in the effort, you can grind an iron bar into a needle. Although you don't write very well today, you have written two characters after all. Since you can write two, you can write two hundred, two thousand...; Since you can write them as big as teacups, you can also write them as small as mung beans. The key is whether you have the determination!"
 "The key is whether you have the determination!" He repeatedly chewed on this sentence of the responsible comrade. "Yes!... Besides, these difficulties of mine were caused by the enemy. If I am intimidated by these difficulties and retreat in the face of difficulties, it is tantamount to being conquered by the enemy. No, a member of the Youth League should treat the difficulties in front of him like an enemy, and use the determination to fight to overcome them, to eliminate them!" Therefore, without hindering his health and treatment, he began to practice hard. His arm felt bone-chilling pain time and time again, and sweat soaked his clothes time and time again. One day, two days, twenty days... One character, two characters, twenty characters..., his arm was actually not sore or painful, and he wrote the characters smaller and neater, and he could write more than two hundred characters in half an hour. When he effortlessly wrote the ten characters "天下无难事，只怕心不专" (Nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it) and pasted them on the wall above his bed, he smiled like a child.
 That night, when he was sleeping, he seemed to walk into a steel factory, and the superiors assigned him to do trade union work. The factory was carrying out a competition to learn from advanced Soviet experience, and it was a lively scene everywhere. The huge factory buildings, towering chimneys, and hot steel streams that he had seen on the screen and in pictorials before were now all displayed before his eyes. He felt both unfamiliar and cordial to all of this. On the second day of entering the factory, the superiors asked him to formulate a specific plan for the workshop's amateur cultural learning and recreational activities. He felt excited and unfamiliar. He, sitting at a new desk, began to work, concentrating on thinking, considering....
 A slight ringing sound interrupted his thinking. He drowsily opened his only right eye and found that he was still lying in the hospital bed, and the doctor had come to see the patient again. He looked at the hard-working doctor, looked at the ten characters he had written and pasted on the head of the bed, and a smile that flowed from the bottom of his heart appeared on his face. He asked the nurse on duty to insert the pen for him, and in one breath, he wrote down all the things he had just experienced in his diary, and finally wrote: "Roads are made by people walking, as long as you are willing to walk, there will definitely be a road!"
 This was the first diary he had written by hand after being wounded. From then on, his diary was filled with traces of his meaningful life every day. In June 1952, after he was elected as the propaganda committee member of the Youth League branch, he needed to write even more things. During the "August 1st" Army Day that year, he copied tens of thousands of characters of propaganda materials from the newspaper and carried out propaganda and mobilization work among the masses. In March 1953, after his wound had completely healed, he was transferred to the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Servicemen's Sanatorium. His diary continued, and he also took time to practice calligraphy. From April 1952 to May this year, he personally wrote more than 300,000 words of life diaries, various articles, letters, and work summaries!
 On one page of his diary, it is written: "...My life has been completely handed over to the Party, and I will fight for the complete realization of communism! I want to strive to be able to say, as Pavel thought, 'I have dedicated my entire life and all my energy to the most magnificent cause in the world—the struggle for the liberation of mankind' when I am about to die."

   肯走，就有路
   失去双手的志愿军伤员尤辉同志学会写字的故事
   卫翔
        （一）
    一九五一年十一月的一个傍晚，在朝鲜前沿的一个防空洞里，抬进来了一个受伤很重的志愿军战士，他是在来前沿执行任务的路上被敌机炸伤的，他的名字叫尤辉。
    不知道经过了多长的时间，当麻醉剂在尤辉的身上失去了效能，他才从昏迷中苏醒过来。顿时，浑身感到一阵剧烈的疼痛，他觉得右臂轻了许多，左胳膊、头和脸都被绷带包了起来。一阵恐怖的阴影涌上了他的心头：“右胳膊和左眼全完了，左手只剩下三个指头，头、脸也受了重伤，将来会成为一个完全无用的人，一个只会吃饭不能工作的人。我这样年轻……”于是，他痛哭了。
    十多天后，他从朝鲜前线回到了母亲的怀抱——祖国的一个医院里。仅有的三个指头，由于在朝鲜前线用了奸商代做的含毒的救急包，也全部溃烂了。他的心好像碎了一样。他想：“祖国是越发可爱了，可是我却完了。一个人成天什么都不能干，吃饭、穿衣、撒尿……都全靠别人，活着还有什么用呢？”伤口的疼痛，使他经常发晕，但有时他宁愿咬着牙忍受疼痛，也不愿医生给他治疗。
    “尤辉同志，你负伤是光荣的，是为了党的事业，是为了全人类的幸福。对于像你这样的同志，党和人民是永远不会忘记的，会永远照顾你的。希望你不要消极悲观，应该好好地安心休养，保持并发扬你的光荣……。”这是医院里的赵指导员对尤辉同志第一次的谈话。
    他说：“指导员，我并不是埋怨自己成了残废，也不是认为自己负伤不光荣，更不是害怕党和人民不照顾我。我只是想，像我这样年青的人，又是青年团员，整天什么也不能做，处处要别人照顾……。”
    赵指导员研究了尤辉的思想情况后，第二天又和他进行了长时间的谈话。他对尤辉说：“一个成了残废、失去了健康的人，免不了是要难过的；但是肉体的残废并不等于是一个人的残废，比如说吧，像你没有右臂，左眼也失去了光明，但是只要你能够从思想上坚强起来，还可以做一个党的优秀宣传员，做一个青年团的优秀工作者，继续为党为人民的事业效力啊！……”
    指导员的话开始打动了尤辉的心，他悲观的情绪渐渐减轻了，伤势也渐渐好转了。这时，领导上又专门给他介绍了苏联文学名著“钢铁是怎样炼成的”，要他读，赵指导员还不断地去和他谈话，给他讲“真正的人”里的密里席叶夫失掉双脚学会驾驶驱逐机的故事。慢慢地，他的整个心灵就被保尔和密里席叶夫的伟大英雄形象所占据。每当他不健康的思想意识要抬头时，他就仿佛看到了一位全身瘫痪、双目失明了的巨人坐在他的身旁，紧握住他的左胳膊说：“人最宝贵的东西是生命。生命属于我们只有一次。一个人的生命是应当这样度过的：当他回首往事的时候，他不因虚度年华而悔恨，也不因碌碌无为而羞耻。”
        （二）
    生活下去，像保尔，像密里席叶夫那样生活下去的念头逐渐坚强起来了。他首先考虑到如何来独自处理自己的日常生活问题。他想：“每天三顿饭都得叫别人来喂，每顿都要二十分钟，一天就需要一个钟头。比如，我再活三十年，就要占掉别人一万多小时的时间，假如把这些时间都用到生产上去，该会给国家增产多少财富啊！”他想到这里，不觉猛然吃了一惊，又自言自语地说：“这是罪过，不能再这样继续下去！”
    要解决吃饭问题，唯一的办法就是在自己仅有的左胳膊上打主意。他曾无数次举起这只胳膊，但又无数次地放了下去，忽而充满了信心，忽而丧失了勇气。一天，他陡然想起了一件往事：那还是在他童年的时候，在家乡曾看到了一位教书的老先生在手腕转弯的地方挟着笔写字的情景。当时他曾为此而惊奇。他想：“虽然我没有了手，不能像那位老先生一样地写字，但是要把绷带绑在胳膊的尖端，在绷带上挖两个孔，再把勺子插在孔里，一勺，一勺地……成，一定成！”
    第一次试验开始了。可是勺子口浅，柄也短，很难把菜饭如愿地送到口里，同时伤口还没有全部好，胳膊挥动起来也不方便。那天晚饭没有吃到多少，大都洒到桌子和衣服上了。帮助他试验的护士又是同情，又是着急，劝他不要试验了。他坚决不肯。
      “尤辉同志，”那位护士最后只得严肃地说，“你对我的工作有意见吗？”这句突然的问话，使他感到吃惊。停了一下，他回答：“不，没有意见！”“没有意见，就应该让我喂你吃饭，因为这是我的职责！”……
    试验尽管失败了，但他并没有灰心。每天晚上等别人睡着了，他就找赞同他这样做的同房休养员，帮他绑上绷带，插上勺子，躺在被窝里练习。一遍，两遍，一天，两天……不知道经过了多长的时间，动作熟练了，胳膊也不酸了，他觉着有了把握。一天晚上，大家又都睡着了，他把白天留下来的一杯冷开水当饭菜，做了一次实习，一杯水没有多久就叫喝完了，他高兴得几乎跳了起来。
    第二天早饭时，他好几次要求护士让他再做一次试验，护士最后还是答应了。当菜饭一勺勺顺利地送进了他的嘴里时，护士笑了，他也笑了，同房的休养员同志都为他的胜利而欢呼了起来！
    自此，他对生活充满了更大的信心和希望，开始练习戴帽子、铺叠被窝、扫地、解小便、提水……等动作。
            （三）
    生活告诉他必须继续前进，丝毫也不能停留。祖国建设成就的新闻，双目失明全身瘫痪的保尔写长篇小说的事实，使他越发感到他未来生活的意义。他想：“我的右眼还能给我光明，我首先得学会写字啊！”怎么样写呢？白天，黑夜，他都沉醉在烦恼和希望中。第一次，他用嘴咬着笔练习写，但是力量怎么也使不均匀。笔下轻了，字迹模糊不清；下重了，不是把纸划破，就是堆积一大块墨水。他本打算写出“战斗的开始”五个字，但只写了一个“战”字和半个“斗”字，纸被划破了，“战”字旁边还滴了两三滴墨水。再想写下去，牙齿酸疼起来，嘴一松劲，钢笔也掉在地上了。
    试验没有成功，使他有些灰心起来了，但当他想到了医院党的领导同志对他的鼓励：“路是人走出来的，只要肯走，一定会有路！”他好像又看到了希望。他又在自己仅有的左胳膊上打主意了。他举起这只胳膊看看，马上又无力地垂了下去；刚刚垂下去，接着又举了起来。“它，也能够担负起写字的任务吗？行！……不……”终于，他像孩子发现了什么珍奇的东西似地，凝视着那插勺子的地方：“在它的前面再挖两个眼，钢笔……然后……就会像留声机的唱针一样在唱盘上按照规律旋转……。”但是，喜悦很快又被苦恼所代替，写了半个多钟头，在纸上出现的只是歪歪斜斜的茶杯那么大的两个字，而且胳膊和全身都感到酸疼，头也晕了，眼也花了。他看着这两个不像样的字，全身都抑制不住地发起抖来。
    医院党的负责同志知道了这种情况，除了劝他必须首先注意养好身体外，又给了他很大的鼓励：“只要功夫深，铁梁磨绣针。今天你虽然写得不大好，但毕竟写出了两个字来。既然能写出来两个，就能写出两百个，两千个……；既然能够写成茶杯那么大，也就能够写成绿豆那么小。关键在于自己有没有决心！”
    “关键在于自己有没有决心！”他反复咀嚼着负责同志的这一句话。“是呀！……再说我这些困难都是敌人给造成的，如果我被这些困难所吓倒，在困难面前退却，那就等于被敌人征服。不，一个青年团员，对待面前的困难应该像对待敌人那样，用战斗的决心去克服它，去消灭它！”因此，在不妨碍健康和治疗的情况下，他开始艰苦的练习了。胳膊一次次地感到彻骨的酸疼，汗水一次次地浸透了他的衣衫。一天，两天，二十天……一个字，两个字，二十个字……，胳膊居然练得不酸也不疼了，字也写得又小又整齐了，半个钟头可以写两百多个字了。等他不很费力地写出了“天下无难事，只怕心不专”十个字，贴在自己的床头上的墙上时，他像孩子般地笑了。
    就在那天晚上睡觉的时候，他恍惚走进了一个钢铁工厂，上级指定要他做工会工作。厂里在开展着学习苏联先进经验的竞赛运动，到处都是热火朝天。以前，在银幕上，在画报上看到的巨大的厂房，高耸的烟囱，火热的钢流……，现在都展现在他的眼前了。这一切，他感到既陌生，又亲切。就在进厂的第二天，上级就要他拟订一个车间业余文化学习和文娱活动的具体计划。他感到兴奋，又感到生疏。他，坐在新的办公桌旁开始工作了，聚精会神地思索着，考虑着……。
    轻微的铃声，打断了他的思维。他矇眬地睁开了那只仅有的右眼，发现自己仍然躺在病床上，医生又来给病人看病了。他看看辛勤的医生，看看贴在床头上那亲笔写的十个字，一种由心底里流露出来的微笑，浮现在他的面庞上。他请值班护士给他插上了钢笔，一气把刚才经历过的事情全都写在了日记本上，最后这样写着：“路是人走出来的，只要肯走，一定会有路！”
    这是他负伤后第一次亲笔写的日记。从此，他的日记本上天天都留下了他有意义的生活痕迹。一九五二年六月，他被选为团支部的宣传委员后，需要写的东西就更多了。那年“八一”建军节时，他从报纸上抄写了好几万字的宣传材料，向群众进行宣传鼓动工作。一九五三年三月间，伤口完全好了以后，他就被调到了湖北省革命残废军人教养院，他的日记仍然继续着，还抽空练习写毛笔字。从一九五二年四月起，到今年五月止，他亲手写的生活日记、各种文章、信件和工作总结等，已达三十万言以上了！
    在他的日记一页上这样写着：“……我的生命已完全交给了党，我要为共产主义的彻底实现而奋斗！我要像保尔所想的那样，争取在临死时能够说：‘我整个的生命和全部的精力，都已献给世界上最壮丽的事业—为人类的解放而斗争。’”（附图片）
    这是尤辉同志练习写的毛笔字。
