    Bad Management Style and Work Attitude Must Be Corrected
    In the past year, the Shangqiu Branch of the China Food Company has continuously experienced a large number of pig deaths. In the fourth quarter of 1953, the mortality rate for short-distance collection and storage reached 6.41%, and the mortality rate during transportation was 3.07%. From January to April 1954, the mortality rate for short-distance collection and storage was 3.48%. The mortality rate during transportation in April was 6.05%, with deaths en route to Beijing accounting for nearly one-tenth of the total number transported, and the mortality rate for shipments to Shanghai being as high as 32%. Preliminary estimates place the total loss at over one billion yuan. If these pigs were processed into frozen meat for export, they could be exchanged for approximately twenty-five tractors or over one thousand two hundred tons of steel.
    Since its establishment, the Shangqiu Branch has played a role in promoting the purchase of pigs, facilitating the development of pig production, and supplying the needs of cities and exports. However, some leading cadres of the company have developed a sense of complacency and are indifferent to the deaths of pigs, believing that live pigs are commodities, and deaths are inevitable with large purchases. Or they believe that with large operations, some deaths are acceptable as they will not necessarily lead to losses. Therefore, they have not actively studied the business or improved management, resulting in continuous pig deaths and intentionally transporting sick pigs to shirk responsibility.
    Live pigs are living commodities, and under the current equipment conditions, long-term storage is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen purchasing and sales planning and overcome blindness in the work. Close cooperation with cooperatives, and clarifying mutual responsibilities through contracts, is an important part of strengthening operational planning and improving business management. However, the relationship between the Shangqiu Branch and the cooperatives is not close enough, and responsibilities are not clearly defined. The entrusted purchasing contracts did not specify phased collection plans, nor did they clearly define responsibility for deaths and injuries. As a result, some cooperatives have collected both good and bad pigs together. Some have even carried dead pigs to the company to meet quotas. Also, there was no dedicated person responsible for escorting the pigs during collection, but rather temporary workers were hired to drive them. To earn more money, some temporary workers disregarded the life and death of the pigs, drove them quickly en route, and did not feed them, resulting in significant casualties among the pigs. It is estimated that in the past six months, 738 pigs were injured or died due to being rushed, but the Shangqiu Branch turned a blind eye to this and failed to jointly study solutions with the cooperatives for a long time.
    Another important aspect of reducing pig losses is to strengthen feeding management, but the Shangqiu Branch has not paid enough attention to this. The pig pens did not have a set of management systems, and the entire feeding work has long been without anyone responsible. In late March, two pens of pigs were not fed for a day, and feeding was not timed or quantified. In particular, no attention was paid to the hygiene of the pig pens, which were not cleaned regularly, with manure and urine everywhere. In addition, the emergency slaughterhouse for sick pigs was located inside the warehouse gate, with dead pigs, rotten meat, bones, and internal organs scattered everywhere, making it easier for epidemics to occur and spread. The storage and transportation section chief believed that he was doing leadership work and disdained to ask about these "scattered trivial matters," so that no one knew in time when pigs died in the pens or feed rotted, and no one was responsible for managing sick pigs. Over one hundred feeders (mostly temporary workers) have also been without responsible leadership for a long time.
    Even worse, in the operation of pigs, the manager and some section chiefs of the Shangqiu Branch believed that adding the losses of dead pigs to the units to which they were transferred would prevent their own unit from losing money; and that once the sick pigs were shipped out, they would no longer be responsible after delivery. The deputy chief of the storage and transportation section often said: "Once weighed, the buyer is responsible, and we will just note the number of deaths." When sick and weak pigs were found during loading, and the workers raised objections about not loading them, they were not heeded. Sometimes, when weak pigs could not get on the truck, he would order the workers to carry them on their backs. In early April of this year, Shangqiu had a large inventory of pigs, but due to the discovery of an epidemic in the area and poor feeding management, there were many sick and weak pigs, and deaths were increasing daily. The Henan Provincial Company instructed to transfer the good pigs out and dispose of the sick pigs locally. On the morning of the 10th, manager Wu Donghai inspected the condition of the sick pigs in the warehouse. At that time, there were over one thousand three hundred pigs in the warehouse with signs of illness. Wu immediately decided to transfer as many as possible out, and over six hundred were shipped out that day and the next. On the afternoon of the 11th, he hurriedly came to the warehouse again and saw that most of the remaining five hundred pigs were unable to eat. Wu decided to select them again, "to select and load all pigs weighing over ninety jin." That night, twenty-four pigs died in the warehouse. On the morning of the 12th, two hundred and forty pigs were selected from the sick pigs. In order to prevent this batch of sick pigs from being inspected, manager Wu Donghai and deputy section chief Liu Shengzhe actually asked the quarantine station to inspect the good pigs stored in the Daonan warehouse to obtain a fake inspection certificate. After obtaining the inspection certificate through deception, they loaded the sick pigs, resulting in a large number of deaths during transportation, with a mortality rate as high as 37.7%.
    The Shangqiu Branch's bad management style and serious mismanagement are intolerable. In addition to the relevant departments conducting in-depth inspections, reaching conclusions, and proposing improvement suggestions, the company must learn from its lessons and thoroughly correct these errors and shortcomings.

### 恶劣的经营作风和工作态度必须改正

    恶劣的经营作风和工作态度必须改正
    中国食品公司商邱支公司近一年来不断发生大量毛猪死亡事故。一九五三年第四季度短途集中及圈存的死亡率达百分之六·四一，调运途中死亡率占百分之三·○七；一九五四年一至四月份短途集中及圈存死亡率占百分之三·四八；四月份调运途中死亡率为百分之六·○五，其中运北京途中的死亡数几占调运总数的十分之一，运上海的死亡率高达百分之三十二。以上几笔损失初步估算在十亿元以上。这些猪如果加工制成冻肉出口，约可换回二十五部拖拉机，或一千二百多吨钢材。
    商邱支公司自成立以来，对开展毛猪收购，促进毛猪生产的发展，供应城市需要及出口等方面都起到一定作用。但该公司某些领导干部却因此而产生了自满情绪，对毛猪死亡抱漠不关心态度，认为毛猪是活商品，买的多了就难免有死亡；或者认为经营量大、死一些也总不致于赔钱。因此，就没有积极钻研业务、改善经营管理，以至毛猪死亡事故不断发生，并且有意地把病猪外运，企图推卸责任。
    毛猪是活的商品，在目前设备的条件下，长期储存，困难较多，因此必须加强购销计划性，克服工作中的盲目性。与合作社的密切结合，并通过合同明确彼此的责任，是加强经营计划性、改善经营管理的重要一环。而商邱支公司与合作社之间关系是不够密切、责任也不够明确的。在委托代购合同中未规定分期分批集中计划，又未明确死亡伤耗责任，因此曾发生某些合作社有好猪坏猪一齐收的现象。甚至有的还把死猪抬到公司去交数。在集中时也没有专人负责押运，而是临时雇工赶运，部分临时工人为了多挣钱，却不顾猪只死活，在途中急赶，并不喂饲料，致造成毛猪的重大伤亡。计半年来因急赶而造成伤亡的就有七三八头，但商邱支公司对此却熟视无睹，长期未与合作社共同研究解决。
    减少毛猪损失的另一个重要环节是加强饲养管理工作，但商邱支公司对此不够重视。猪仓没有一套管理制度，整个饲养工作长期无人负责。三月下旬就有两圈猪一天没有喂食，喂养也没有定时、定量。特别是不注意猪圈环境卫生，不定时打扫，遍地粪尿，加以病猪急宰场设在仓库大门内，死猪、烂肉、骨头、内脏到处乱丢，就更使疫病容易发生和蔓延。而储运股长自认为是做领导工作的，不屑去过问这些“零星琐事”，以致圈内猪死了，饲料腐烂了，都没有人及时知道，病猪也没有人负责管理。一百多名饲养工人（大都是临时工人）也长期无人负责领导。
    更恶劣的是商邱支公司在经营毛猪中，经理和部分股长们竟认为把猪死了的损失加到外调的单位中去，本单位不会赔本；猪病了运出去，交货后就没有自己的责任。储运股副股长常说：“过磅后就归买方负责，死了给他们记住数。”装车时发现有病软猪，工人提出意见不能装运，也不采纳，有时软猪不能上车，他就叫工人硬往上背。今年四月初，商邱存猪较多，但因当地发现疫情，又由于饲养管理不善，病软猪很多，死亡日增；河南省公司指示好猪外调、病猪就地处理。十日上午，经理吴东海到仓库视察病猪情况，当时库内已有精神不振的猪一千三百多头，吴即决定尽量外调，当天和第二天就运出了六百多头；十一日下午又赶忙来到仓库，见挑剩下五百多头猪已大都不能吃食，吴又决定再挑，“把够九十斤以上的猪都挑出来装走”；这天晚上，仓库内的猪就死了二十四头，十二日上午从病猪内挑出了二四○头，为了这批病猪不能报验，吴东海经理和刘圣哲副股长竟叫检疫站去检验道南仓库存的好猪，来骗取检验证。把检验证骗到手后，就把病猪装走，结果造成运输中的大量死亡，死亡率高达百分之三七·七。
    商邱支公司的恶劣经营作风和严重的经营管理不善的情况是不能令人容忍的，除有关部门已深入检查，并作出结论，提出改进意见外，该公司必须记取教训，并彻底改正这些错误和缺点。（野夫）
