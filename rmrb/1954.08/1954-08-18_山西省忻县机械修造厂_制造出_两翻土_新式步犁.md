Shanxi Xin County Local State-Operated Mechanical Repair Factory

Manufactures New "Double Plow" Walking Plow

During a worker-peasant get-together in February of this year, the Xin County Local State-Operated Mechanical Repair Factory in Shanxi Province accepted the farmers' request to manufacture a new "double plow" walking plow and immediately began trial production. They have now successfully completed the trial production.

The advantages of the "double plow" walking plow are: easy to use, can be pulled by a single animal, suitable for use in mountainous areas and small plots; it can plow one inch deeper than the old plow, and the soil is turned evenly; the cost is low and the price is cheap. On the morning of July 1st, the factory demonstrated the first successfully trial-produced "double plow" walking plow at the first People's Congress meeting held in Xin County. Many representatives wanted to sign purchase contracts with the factory on the spot after hearing the introduction.

In order to ensure quality and suitability, the factory plans to make thirty "double plow" plows first, then send workers to the mountainous areas to demonstrate and teach farmers how to use them, and solicit farmers' opinions for further improvement, before mass production.

    山西省忻县机械修造厂
    制造出“两翻土”新式步犁
    山西地方国营忻县机械修造厂，在今年二月间进行工农联欢时，接受了农民提出制造“两翻土”新式步犁的要求后，即开始试制。现在已经试制成功了。
    “两翻土”步犁的好处：使用轻便，一个牲口就能拉动，适用于山地和小块地使用；比旧犁能深耕一寸，翻土均匀；成本低，价格便宜。七月一日上午，该厂将试制成功的第一部“两翻土”新式步犁，在忻县召开的第一次人民代表大会会议上进行了表演。不少代表听到介绍后，当场就要和工厂签订购买合同。
    该厂为保证质量、保证适用，计划做起三十部“两翻土”步犁后，派工人携带深入山区，为农民表演和教给农民使用，并征求农民意见继续改进，然后大量制造。
