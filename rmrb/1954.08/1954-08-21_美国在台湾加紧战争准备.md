Xinhua News Agency, August 19th: According to a report by Washington columnist Robert Allen published in the Tokyo "Mainichi Shimbun" on the 17th, US authorities are accelerating war preparations in Taiwan, attempting to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and to expand their aggression against China. Allen revealed that the United States has "already taken long-term military measures" in Taiwan. The US Navy has been ordered to patrol the "entire Chinese coast." The US military strength in the Taiwan Strait "has doubled" and is uniformly placed under the command of Admiral Kiewiet, commander of the US Seventh Fleet's Task Force 72. It is reported that Kiewiet has established headquarters in the Penghu Islands. At the same time, the United States has shipped weapons and war materials originally intended for the Indochina theater to Taiwan for storage. Allen also revealed that the former commander of the Seventh Fleet's Task Force 72, Heding, has been recalled to Washington to be responsible for planning the strategic plan for invading China under the leadership of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

    美国在台湾加紧战争准备
    【新华社十九日讯】据东京“每日新闻”十七日刊载的华盛顿专栏作家罗伯特·艾伦的一篇报道透露，美国当局正在台湾加速进行战争准备，企图阻挠中国人民解放台湾，并扩大对中国的侵略行动。艾伦透露，美国在台湾“已经采取了长远的军事措施”。美国海军已奉令在“整个中国海岸”进行巡逻。美国在台湾海峡的军事力量“已增加了一倍”，并统一置于美国第七舰队第七十二特遣舰队司令基维特的指挥之下。据悉，基维特已在澎湖列岛设立了总部。同时，美国已把原来准备用于印度支那战场的武器和作战物资运到台湾储存起来。艾伦并透露，前任第七舰队第七十二特遣舰队司令赫丁已被召回华盛顿，在参谋长联席会议的领导下负责策划侵略中国的战略计划。
