The flood control work in the northern Jiangsu Province of the lower reaches of the Huai River has achieved preliminary victory. After this year's extraordinarily large flood of the Huai River flowed into Hongze Lake, the Sanhe Sluice on the shore of Hongze Lake and a series of sluice and dam projects already completed in the Huai River downstream water control project effectively controlled the Huai River flood. As of the 14th, the water level of Hongze Lake was still controlled at 15.03 meters, which was 1.15 meters lower than the highest flood level in 1931. The water levels of Baoying Lake and Gaoyou Lake were still controlled at about 9.1 meters, which was more than 3 decimeters lower than the highest flood level in 1931.

At the beginning of this year's Huai River flood control, the Jiangsu Provincial Huai River Water Control Headquarters used the completed water control projects to discharge a large amount of floodwater in advance in order to meet the flood peak. The flood discharge flow through the Sanhe Sluice was increased from the original plan of 8,000 cubic meters per second to 10,500 cubic meters per second. The flood discharge flow into the Subei Irrigation Main Canal through the Gaoliangjian Water Inlet Sluice and discharged into the Yellow Sea was also increased from the original plan of 700 cubic meters per second to 780 cubic meters per second. In addition, 200 cubic meters per second of floodwater was discharged through the Zhangfu River and entered the sea through the abandoned Yellow River. In this way, the water level of Hongze Lake was greatly lowered before the arrival of the huge flood peak. In order to increase the flood discharge of the Huai River into the Yangtze River, the Jiangsu Provincial Huai River Water Control Headquarters also promptly rectified the waterway into the Yangtze River, successively dismantled the Guijiang dams and the Wugang and Xingang dams between Gaoyou Lake and Shaobo Lake, dredged the Maotang Port of Gaoyou Lake and the shallow sections of the canal with dredgers; and cleared the fish weirs and firewood from the lake surface, so that the flood discharge flow into the Yangtze River increased to more than 9,000 cubic meters per second, breaking the past saying that "the Yangtze and Huai Rivers support each other, and the Huai River cannot enter the Yangtze River." Now, the flood control workers in northern Jiangsu are vigilantly guarding the dikes of Hongze Lake, the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, and the canal, preparing to meet more severe tests and finally overcome the flood.

Since August, there has been widespread rainfall in the Yellow River basin. On August 6, the first flood peak entered Shandong Province. The second flood peak reached Anhui at 2:00 AM on the 9th. The two flood peaks converged below Sunkou, Shouzhang County, causing the water level at Sunkou to reach 47.63 meters on the 9th, exceeding 0.32 meters in 1949. The third flood peak arrived at 1:00 AM on the 11th, and the water level at Sunkou rebounded to 47.5 meters at 2:00 PM. At 3:00 AM on the 12th, the water level at Luokou had reached 29.83 meters and was still rising.

After the flood entered Shandong Province, the vast numbers of cadres and the masses along the river have urgently engaged in flood control. More than 2,000 responsible cadres and full-time flood control cadres from various regions and counties have successively gone to the dikes to direct the defense. The flood control army of more than 133,300 people, which has been reorganized, has prepared tools for patrolling the dikes, checking the water, and repairing leaks, and is vigilantly monitoring the changes in the water situation. The beach areas within the 540 li dike section in the Heze and Liaocheng areas, where the flood peak first arrived, have been generally flooded and are close to the dikes. Flood control and rescue have entered a tense stage. The entire region has prepared more than 17.9 million catties of willow branches and straw. More than 12,000 backbone team members, led by more than 1,000 cadres, are patrolling the dikes, checking the water, and repairing leaks day and night in the wind and rain. The Provincial Flood Control Headquarters once again telegraphed various localities, in addition to continuing to strengthen the defense against the current flood peak, also requested to seize the gaps between the flood peaks to strengthen the political and technical education of the cadres and the masses of the flood control team, raise vigilance a hundredfold, and prepare for long-term flood control.

    淮河下游防汛工作获得初步胜利
    山东人民正和黄河洪水紧张搏斗
    淮河下游江苏省北部地区的防汛工作已取得初步胜利。今年淮河的特大洪水下泄入洪泽湖后，洪泽湖畔的三河闸和淮河下游治淮工程中已做好的一系列闸坝工程都有效地控制了淮河洪水。洪泽湖的水位到十四日止，仍控制在十五点零三公尺，比一九三一年最高洪水位低一点一五公尺。宝应湖、高邮湖的水位仍控制在九点一公尺左右，低于一九三一年最高洪水位三公寸多。
    今年淮河防汛一开始，江苏省治淮指挥部为了迎接洪峰就利用已完成的治淮工程先期大量宣泄洪水。经三河闸下泄的洪水流量，由原计划八千秒公方增加到一万零五百秒公方。经高良涧进水闸流入苏北灌溉总渠，排入黄海的泄洪流量也由原计划七百秒公方增加到七百八十秒公方。另外又利用张福河排泄二百秒公方的洪水，经废黄河入海。这样在巨大的洪峰到达前，首先大大降低了洪泽湖的水位。为了增加淮河入江的泄洪量，江苏省治淮指挥部又及时整理了入江水道，先后拆除了归江各坝和高邮湖、邵伯湖之间的五港、新港两坝，用挖泥机船疏浚了高邮湖的毛塘港和运河的浅段；清除了湖面的鱼簖和柴草，使洪水入江下泄流量增加到九千多秒公方，打破了过去认为“江淮顶托，淮水不能入江”的说法。现在苏北防汛民工，正百倍警惕地坚守在洪泽湖、苏北灌溉总渠和运河的堤防线上，准备迎接更严重的考验，最后战胜洪水。

    黄河流域自八月以来普遍降雨，八月六日，首次洪峰进入山东境内，第二次洪峰九日二时到达安徽，两次洪峰在寿张县孙口以下汇为一流，使孙口九日水位高达四七点六三公尺，超过一九四九年零点三二公尺。第三次洪峰又于十一日一时到达，下午二时孙口水位回涨至四七点五公尺。十二日三时洛口水位已达二九点八三公尺。并仍在续涨中。
    洪水进入山东境内后，沿河广大干部和群众，已紧急投入防汛，各专区、县负责干部和专职防汛干部共二千余人，均先后上堤指挥防守。经过整顿组织起来的十三万三千三百余人的防汛大军，已准备好巡堤查水抢险堵漏的工具，警惕地监视着水情的变化。洪峰最先到达的菏泽、聊城地区五百四十华里的堤段内滩地已普遍漫水靠堤，防汛抢险已进入紧张阶段，全区已备好柳枝、秸等一千七百九十余万斤。基干班一万二千余人，在干部千余人的带领下，昼夜冒着风雨巡堤查水抢险堵漏。省防汛指挥部再次电示各地，除继续加强对目前洪峰的防守外，并要求抓紧洪峰间隙，加强对干部和群众防汛队伍的政治、技术教育，百倍地提高警惕，作持久防汛准备。　（窦守宽）
