Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 30th: According to TASS, French Prime Minister Mendès France spoke on the "European Army" issue on the 29th during a debate in the French National Assembly. He began by stating that his government had entrusted General Koenig and Boucher-Moroni to coordinate the differing views between the supporters and opponents of the "European Army" treaty, but without any result. He then discussed the compromise proposals put forward by the French delegation at the Brussels conference, saying that France's five "European Defense Community" partners did not agree to his suggestions.

Mendès France said that the talks in Brussels were not only difficult but often "humiliating."

Mendès France analyzed the discussions on various parts of the French proposals. When discussing military matters, he emphasized that not all aspects of this issue could be made public at present. He pointed out that the treaty stipulated the following balance of power: France, fourteen divisions; West Germany, twelve divisions. However, it was clear that the French divisions were at a significant disadvantage compared to the German divisions because the French divisions were understrength. He said he had sought to reach an agreement in the Brussels conference on maintaining the above-mentioned balance of power, but his proposal was rejected. He pointed out the danger of entrusting the military budget to the Council of Ministers of the "European Defense Community," because this would mean that the National Assembly would no longer be able to oversee this most important issue, and would only be approving the decisions made by the aforementioned body. He said he proposed amending this provision at the Brussels conference, but this proposal was rejected.

Mendès France, referring to the argument that a conference of relevant countries could be convened in the future to amend the treaty, emphasized that France only had the right to strive to convene a meeting, but could not guarantee that its proposed amendments to the treaty would be adopted.

Mendès France continued that France's "European Defense Community" partners disagreed with France's proposals on the issue of the right to withdraw from the "European Army," on the right to appeal against the decisions of the Standing Committee, on the economic and legal aspects of the issue, and on the issue of unified armed forces. "They asked me to adopt the suggestions they made at the Brussels conference, but I could not agree with their opinions, because that would exceed the limits that the majority of members of the National Assembly could accept."

Mendès France concluded by saying that the foundation of French foreign policy was the Atlantic Alliance and that the French government would never take any decision that contradicted the Atlantic Alliance. Mendès France said that the alliance between France and Britain must be maintained and that Franco-German "reconciliation" must be achieved.

After Mendès France's speech, the parliament immediately adjourned.

    在法国国民议会二十九日会议上
    法国总理就“欧洲防务集团”问题发言
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯二十九日在法国国民议会辩论“欧洲军”问题时发言。他首先说，他的政府曾委托柯尼格将军和布歇—莫诺里协调“欧洲军”条约的拥护者和反对者之间的不同观点，但是没有得到任何结果。接着他谈到法国代表团在布鲁塞尔会议上所提的折衷建议，他说，法国的五个“欧洲防务集团”伙伴不同意他的建议。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯说，布鲁塞尔的会谈不仅是困难的，而且常常是“屈辱的”。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯分析了就法国建议的各个部分所进行的会谈。在谈到军事问题时他着重指出，这个问题的一切方面并不是现在都可以公布的。他指出，条约规定了下面的力量对比：法国十四个师，西德十二个师。但是很明显，法国的师要比德国的师处于很劣势的地位，因为法国的师名额不足。他说他在布鲁塞尔会议曾力求就保持上述的力量对比达成协议，但是他的建议被拒绝了。他指出把军事预算交给“欧洲防务集团”部长理事会处理的危险性，因为这等于说，国民议会将不能再过问这个最重要的问题，而将仅是批准上述机构作出的决议，他说他在布鲁塞尔会议上提出了修改这项条款的建议，但是这个建议被拒绝了。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯提到关于有可能在将来召开有关国家的会议来修改这个条约的论调时着重说：法国仅只有权利争取召开会议，却不能保障它提出的修改条约的建议获得通过。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯继续说，法国的“欧洲防务集团”伙伴，无论在退出“欧洲军”的权利问题上，无论在对常务委员会的决议提出申诉的权利问题上，无论在问题的经济和法律方面，无论在统一武装力量的问题上，都不同意法国的建议。“他们要求我采纳他们在布鲁塞尔会议上提出的建议，但是我不能同意他们的意见，因为这就等于超出了国民议会大多数议员所能接受的范围。”
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯最后说，法国外交政策的基础是大西洋联盟，并且说法国政府永远也不会采取任何和大西洋联盟相矛盾的决定。孟戴斯—弗朗斯说，必须保持法国同英国的同盟和取得法、德的
  “和解”。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯发言后，议会随即休息。
