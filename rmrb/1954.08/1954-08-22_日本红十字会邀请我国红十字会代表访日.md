    The Japanese Red Cross Society Invites Representatives of the Chinese Red Cross Society to Visit Japan
    Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, recently received a telegram from Tadatsugu Shimazu, President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, formally inviting the Chinese Red Cross Society to send representatives to visit Japan in September. Li Dequan has replied to Tadatsugu Shimazu accepting the formal invitation of the Japanese Red Cross Society, but due to the busy schedules of the representatives of the Chinese Red Cross Society, it is suggested that the period for the visit to Japan be changed to early October. This suggestion has been accepted by Tadatsugu Shimazu in a reply telegram.
    As early as the beginning of last year, the Japanese Red Cross Society proposed inviting representatives of the Chinese Red Cross Society to visit Japan to express its gratitude for the Chinese Red Cross Society's enthusiastic assistance in the repatriation of Japanese nationals in China. Since then, the Japanese people have continuously passed resolutions at many gatherings, requesting the Japanese government to agree to the entry of representatives of the Chinese Red Cross Society, so as to realize this invitation as soon as possible. At the end of May this year, the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors of the Japanese Diet successively and unanimously passed resolutions requesting the Japanese government to agree to invite representatives of the Chinese Red Cross Society to visit Japan. On August 3rd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Japanese government finally expressed its agreement to invite representatives of the Chinese Red Cross Society to visit Japan.

    日本红十字会邀请我国红十字会代表访日
    【新华社二十日讯】中国红十字会总会会长李德全最近接到了日本红十字会会长岛津忠承的来电，正式邀请中国红十字会在九月间派代表访问日本。李德全已复电岛津忠承接受日本红十字会的正式邀请，但因中国红十字会的代表们工作繁忙，建议将访问日本的时期改在十月上旬。这个建议业经岛津忠承复电表示接受。
    早在去年年初，日本红十字会即提出邀请中国红十字会的代表到日本访问，以表示对中国红十字会热诚协助在华日侨回国的谢意。自此以后，日本人民在许多的集会上不断通过决议，要求日本政府同意中国红十字会代表入境，以早日实现这一邀请。今年五月底，日本国会众议院和参议院相继一致通过了要求日本政府同意邀请中国红十字会代表访问日本的决议。八月三日，日本政府外务省终于表示同意邀请中国红十字会代表到日本访问。
