    The American Senate and House of Representatives recently passed reactionary bills declaring the American Communist Party illegal. Ignoring all solemn protests, U.S. President Eisenhower signed this reactionary bill on August 24. The American government is attempting to strangle the freedom of the American people by imposing such barbaric oppression on the American Communist Party. This is clearly the darkest and most reactionary fascist measure in American history. Just as Hitler used the oppression of the German Communist Party as a step in implementing his overall fascist policy, today the American ruling clique's declaration of the American Communist Party as illegal is also a serious step in its oppression of all democratic forces in the United States. This is intolerable to all people who advocate peace and democracy.
    In recent years, in order to seek maximum profits for Wall Street's monopoly capital, the American ruling clique has painstakingly engaged in arms expansion and war preparations, and carried out aggression. However, with the realization of the Korean armistice and the agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina, the American ruling clique's aggressive policies have suffered major setbacks; the United States' attempts to create tension in various parts of the world have been met with increasing and stronger opposition; more and more countries in the world advocate peaceful coexistence. At the same time, the American people's call for peace and opposition to aggressive wars has risen; and the U.S. government's inability to solve the increasingly serious unemployment problem caused by the development of the economic crisis and the continuous decline in farmers' incomes has aroused widespread discontent among the people. Now, the American ruling clique's declaration of the American Communist Party as illegal is clearly aimed at further suppressing the American people's demands for peace and democracy and their growing dissatisfaction with the economic crisis.
    Thirty-five years of history have proven that the American Communist Party is the most loyal representative and defender of the interests of the American people and the national interests. Its action program and policies have always been formulated based on the wishes of the broad masses of the people and the requirements of social progress. During the economic crisis of the 1930s and on the eve of World War II, the American Communist Party waged a persistent struggle to win the people's right to life and democratic rights, and to oppose fascism and the threat of war. During World War II, the American Communist Party implemented a policy of uniting the people of the country to support the anti-fascist war, making no small contribution to the just cause of the world's people. Approximately 15,000 American Communists directly demonstrated special heroism in the war against German and Japanese fascism, and many received medals. After the war, because the American monopoly capital group attempted to dominate the world, creating a serious crisis of a new world war, the American Communist Party invested the greatest strength in the struggle to defend peace. Comrade Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, pointed out in a statement issued on May 22, 1949: "In the current critical world situation, the American Communist Party recognizes its great task, in cooperation with all other forces for peace, to awaken and unite the American people to resist the American rulers—the monopoly capitalists—who are leading the United States and the world into a devastating war catastrophe."
    In order to implement this general political line, the American Communist Party has stood together with the American people in recent years, resolutely opposing the war of aggression against Korea launched by the American ruling clique, opposing American interference in the Indochina war, and opposing the American policy of hostility and aggression towards the People's Republic of China. The American Communist Party advocates banning atomic and hydrogen bombs, ending American war propaganda and "Cold War" policies, advocating that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, and that all international disputes should be resolved through consultation. The American Communist Party has made unremitting efforts to achieve peaceful cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and the United States, China and the United States, and the people of all countries in the world, and to restore the United Nations to an agency for maintaining international peace and security. It is very clear that all of this is in line with the immediate requirements of the American people and the national interests of the United States, and also in line with the interests of the people of the world.
    Since there is a working class in the United States, there must also be a political party of the working class. The American Communist Party is the vanguard of the American working class. Like the Communist Parties of all countries in the world, the American Communist Party does not conceal its supreme political program, which is to establish the most happy communist society for mankind in the United States. But the Communist Party has always believed that revolution cannot be imported or exported. A new social system can only be realized through the will and action of the broad masses of the people.
    However, the frantic American ruling clique slanders the American Communist Party, composed of the most outstanding sons and daughters of the American people, as a "small organization of conspirators," and they slander the American Communist Party as "un-American." The only reason they can give is that the American Communist Party is part of the "world communist movement." The fact is that American Communists are not only American patriots, but also working-class internationalists. In solidarity with all peace-loving people, American Communists are faithful to the traditions of Jefferson and Lincoln. Lincoln said: "The strongest ties of human sympathy, apart from family relationships, should be the ties that bind together all working people of all nations, languages and races." Similarly, American Communists are faithful to Roosevelt's policy of friendly cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union, because this cooperation was, and still is, in the fundamental interests of the American people in the anti-fascist war.
    In the United States, there is indeed a small group of people who are disloyal to the United States and the American people. They are none other than the American ruling clique that serves those large trusts. They always place the interests of monopolies and cartels above the interests of the nation and the people. Who does not know that during the anti-fascist war, American big capitalists maintained cartel relationships with German and Japanese fascists, and often supplied important products and raw materials to the enemies of the American people? The world-known fact is that: Standard Oil kept the secret of the artificial rubber production process from the U.S. government, while handing the secret over to Farben, the trust that designed methods of killing for Hitler. Today, there is indeed a force in the United States that endangers the safety of the American people. It is none other than the American ruling clique, which represents the interests of Wall Street, rearming West Germany and Japan, carrying out aggression abroad, and engaging in bloody oppression at home.
    From the time the American reactionaries illegally arrested the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party four years ago, to today, when the American Congress passed the "bill" banning the Communist Party, the American and world people are constantly reminded of Hitler's anti-communist policy. History records that Hitler's anti-communist policy was nothing but a smokescreen to cover up the Nazi's deprivation of all rights of the German people and the launching of wars of aggression abroad. The American ruling clique has implemented the evil "loyalty investigation" for several years, trampling on more than three million American citizens. The American secret service agency, the "Federal Bureau of Investigation," claims to have collected fingerprints of more than 113 million people, placing every honest American in an atmosphere of terror. Hitler's old trick of burning books has been replayed in the United States. "McCarthyism" has invaded all aspects of American citizens' lives. The "Declaration of Human Rights" that the American people are proud of has been torn to shreds by the reactionaries and is completely corrupt. The decadent and rotten monopoly capital group has taken off all the cloaks of bourgeois democracy, completely throwing the democratic traditions of Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt to the winds.
    This fascist behavior of the American ruling clique has aroused resistance from many social groups and the broad masses of the American people, and has been resented by the people of the world. The American ruling clique's declaration of the glorious American Communist Party as "illegal" proves nothing but that the American ruling clique is afraid of the people, afraid of peace, hostile to the people, and hostile to peace.
    The Chinese people firmly support the just cause of the American people represented by the American Communist Party. Because this cause is in line with the interests of the American people and the peace-loving people of the world, it will not be destroyed by any force. The American reactionaries' heinous fascist policy will not have a better ending than that of the Nazis.
    This fascist measure of the American government once again proves the hypocrisy of the bourgeois democratic system, proving that the bourgeois democratic system is actually a bourgeois dictatorship disguised by constitutions and parliaments. There is no difference between the United States and other capitalist countries in this regard. The so-called "American exceptionalism" and the so-called "United States is the home of democracy and freedom" have now completely gone bankrupt. The United States, as the last pillar of capitalism, has now nakedly torn off its so-called "democracy and freedom" mask. What is the significance of this? This matter shows that the American ruling clique has lost confidence in tomorrow. It is the responsibility of the Communists to more resolutely lead the people to struggle for peace, for democracy and freedom, for the national liberation of oppressed nations, and for the realization of socialism.

### 美国统治集团的法西斯措施

    美国统治集团的法西斯措施
    美国参议院和众议院不久以前先后通过了宣布美国共产党为非法的反动法案，美国总统艾森豪威尔竟不顾各方的严正抗议于八月二十四日签署了这个反动法案。美国政府企图以对美国共产党实行这种野蛮的压迫，来绞杀美国人民的自由权利。这显然是美国历史上最黑暗、最反动的法西斯措施。正如当年的希特勒以压迫德国共产党作为他实行全盘法西斯政策的步骤一样，今天美国统治集团宣布美国共产党为非法，也正是它压迫美国一切民主力量的一个严重的步骤。这是一切主张和平民主的人们所不能容忍的。
    近几年来，美国统治集团为了替华尔街的垄断资本谋求最大限度的利润，处心积虑地实行扩军备战，进行侵略。但是，随着朝鲜停战的实现和日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议的达成，美国统治集团的侵略政策遭到了重大的挫折；美国企图在世界各处制造紧张局势，却日益受到更多人、更强烈的反对；世界上主张和平共处的国家越来越多了。同时，美国人民要求和平、反对侵略战争的呼声也日益高涨；由于美国政府对于经济危机的发展所形成的日益严重的失业问题和农民收入不断下降问题毫无解决办法，就引起了人民的普遍不满。现在美国统治集团宣布美国共产党为非法，它的目的显然是为了进一步压迫美国人民争取和平民主的要求和对于经济危机所表示的日益不满。
    三十五年的历史证明了，美国共产党是美国人民利益和民族利益的最忠实的代表者和保卫者。它的行动纲领和政策，始终是根据广大人民的愿望和社会进步的要求而制定的。在三十年代的经济危机时期和第二次世界大战前夕，美国共产党为了争取人民的生活权利和民主权利，为了反对法西斯主义和战争威胁，进行了坚持的斗争。在第二次世界大战期间，美国共产党实行了团结全国人民支持反法西斯战争的政策，对世界人民的正义事业作出了不小的贡献，约有一万五千美国共产党人直接在反对德日法西斯的战争中表现了特殊的英勇并有许多人得到了奖章。战后，由于美国垄断资本集团妄图称霸全世界，造成了新的世界战争的严重危机，美国共产党就用最大力量投入了保卫和平的斗争。美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特同志在一九四九年五月二十二日所发表的声明中就已指出：“美国共产党在目前危急的世界局势中，认定它和所有其他和平力量合作的巨大任务，就是要提醒和团结美国人民，反抗正在导引美国和世界进入毁灭性的战争灾难的美国统治者——垄断资本家们。”
    为了贯彻这个总的政治路线，几年来美国共产党和美国人民在一起，坚决反对美国统治集团发动的侵略朝鲜的战争，反对美国对印度支那战争的干涉，反对美国敌视和侵略中华人民共和国的政策。美国共产党主张禁止原子弹和氢弹，主张停止美国的战争宣传和“冷战”政策，主张社会制度不同的国家可以和平共处，一切国际争端应该协商解决。美国共产党为了争取苏美、中美以及世界各国人民之间的和平合作，为了把联合国恢复为维持国际和平与安全的机构，曾作了不懈的努力。十分明显，所有这一切都是符合美国人民的切身要求和美国的民族利益，也符合全世界人民的利益的。
    美国既然有了工人阶级，也就必然有工人阶级的政党。美国共产党正是美国工人阶级的先锋队。和世界各国的共产党一样，美国共产党并不掩盖它的最高政治纲领，是要在美国建立人类最幸福的共产主义社会。但是共产党一向认为，革命是不能输入或输出的。一个新的社会制度只有通过广大人民的意志和行动才能实现。
    然而，丧心病狂的美国统治集团却诬蔑美国人民最优秀的儿女所组成的正大光明的美国共产党是
  “阴谋的小组织”，他们诬蔑美国共产党为“非美”，其理由只能说美国共产党是“世界共产主义运动”的一部分。事实是，美国共产党人不仅是美国的爱国主义者，而且还是工人阶级的国际主义者。在与一切爱好和平的人民的团结中，美国共产党人是忠实于杰弗逊和林肯的传统的。林肯说过：“人类同情心的最坚强的纽带，除去家庭的关系外，应该是那联结着所有的民族的、语言的和血统的一切劳动人民的纽带。”同样，美国共产党人是忠实于罗斯福的美苏友好合作政策的，因为这种合作在反法西斯战争中曾经是、而且现在仍然是符合于美国人民的根本利益的。
    在美国，的确有一小撮不忠于美国和美国人民的人。他们不是别人，恰恰是服务于那些大托辣斯的美国统治集团。他们总是把独占和加迭尔的利益置于民族和人民的利益之上。谁不知道在反法西斯战争中，美国的大资本家们和德日法西斯保持着加迭尔的关系，并经常将重要的产品和原料供给美国人民的敌人呢？举世周知的事实是：美孚油公司对美国政府保守人造橡皮制作过程的秘密，而同时却把这个秘密交给替希特勒设计杀人方法的法本托辣斯。今天，在美国的确有一股危害美国人民安全的势力，它不是别人，正是那代表华尔街的利益、重新武装西德和日本，对外进行侵略，对内进行血腥压迫的美国统治集团。
    从四年前美国反动派非法拘捕美共十一个领导人的时候起，直到美国国会通过取缔共产党的“法案”的今天，随时随地都使美国和世界人民连想起希特勒的反共政策。历史记载着：希特勒的反共政策只不过是掩盖纳粹剥夺德国人民的一切权利、并向国外发动侵略战争的烟幕。美国统治集团几年来实行罪恶的“忠诚调查”，蹂躏了三百万以上美国公民。美国特务机关“联邦调查局”自称已收集了一亿一千三百多万人的手印，使得每一个正直的美国人都处于恐怖气氛中。希特勒焚书的故技，也在美国重演了。“麦卡锡主义”侵犯了美国公民生活的各个方面。美国人民引为骄傲的“人权宣言”已被反动派撕成碎纸了，腐朽透顶了的垄断资本集团已经脱去了一切可以称得起的资产阶级民主的外衣，把杰弗逊、林肯和罗斯福的民主传统完全抛到九霄云外去了。
    美国统治集团的这种法西斯行径，已经引起了美国许多社会团体和广大人民的反抗，并且遭到了全世界人民的愤恨。美国统治集团宣布光荣的美国共产党为“非法”，并不证明别的，而是证明美国统治集团害怕人民、害怕和平，仇视人民、仇视和平。
    中国人民坚决支持美国共产党所代表的美国人民的正义事业。由于这种事业符合于美国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的利益，它就将是任何力量所摧毁不了的。美国反动派的穷凶极恶的法西斯政策，其结局将不会比纳粹的结局更好些。
    美国政府的这一法西斯措施再一次证明资产阶级民主制度的虚伪性，证明资产阶级民主制度实际上只是用宪法和议会等掩盖着的资产阶级专政。在这一点上，美国与其他资本主义国家之间并无分别。所谓“美国特殊”的论调，所谓“美国是民主自由的家乡”的论调，现在是彻底破产了。作为资本主义最后一个支柱的美国，现在已经赤裸裸地撕破它的所谓“民主自由”的假面具了。这件事情有什么意义呢？这件事情说明，美国统治集团已经丧失了对明天的信心。共产主义者的责任，是更坚决地领导人民为和平、为民主自由、为被压迫民族的民族解放，为实现社会主义而奋斗。
