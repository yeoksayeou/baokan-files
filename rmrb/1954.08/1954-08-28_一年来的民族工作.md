Editor's Note: The preamble to the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China states: "All nationalities in our country have united into a free and equal national family. ... The state will take into account the needs of all nationalities in the process of economic and cultural construction, and will fully pay attention to the characteristics of the development of all nationalities in the matter of socialist transformation." The general program of the draft Constitution also stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a unified multi-ethnic state. All nationalities are equal. Discrimination and oppression against any nationality are prohibited, and acts that undermine the unity of all nationalities are prohibited. All nationalities have the freedom to develop their own spoken and written languages, and have the freedom to maintain or reform their customs and habits and religious beliefs. Regional autonomy is practiced in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities. All national autonomous areas are inseparable parts of the People's Republic of China." Section 5 of Chapter 2 further stipulates the autonomous organs of national autonomous areas.

The provisions in the draft Constitution are based on existing facts. For more than four years, our country has correctly implemented the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policies, and all nationalities in our country have united unprecedentedly on the basis of equality; the old appearance of various ethnic minority areas has gradually changed, and a new and prosperous atmosphere has emerged in politics, economy, and culture. The provisions in the draft Constitution precisely reflect the new ethnic relations and new atmosphere that have emerged since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and summarize and fix the experiences and achievements of ethnic work in the past four years in the form of legislation. From the following articles, we can see the many achievements our country has made in ethnic work in recent years.

    Ethnic Work Over the Past Year

In the past year, under the guidance and encouragement of the general task of the state during the transition period and the state's tasks in ethnic issues, which constitute an important part of it, ethnic work has made further progress. The economic construction of various ethnic regions has been elevated to an important position. The continued implementation of the policy of ethnic regional autonomy has achieved new successes. People of all ethnic groups in minority areas where universal suffrage was feasible enthusiastically participated in the election. The training of ethnic minority cadres and the construction of cultural, educational, and health undertakings in various ethnic regions have all achieved many successes. The unity of all nationalities in the country has become closer and more consolidated.

In the past year, under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, local people's governments have made great efforts to develop the economic undertakings of minority areas. In particular, agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry have seen even more significant results. The material and cultural lives of people of all ethnic groups have been correspondingly improved and enhanced.

The level of agricultural production in ethnic minority areas has generally recovered to pre-war levels, and some areas have exceeded the highest pre-war levels. Many areas that used to lack grain are now not only self-sufficient, but some even have surplus grain.

In order to help the people of ethnic minorities develop agricultural production, the People's Government has issued agricultural loans, production subsidies, supplied agricultural implements, built water conservancy projects, and, in some extremely backward areas, issued free iron farm tools. For example, the Southwest Region manufactured more than 1.3 million pieces of various agricultural implements last year, and more than 900,000 pieces had been distributed by the end of the year. In Guizhou Province alone, 140,000 ethnic minority farmers benefited. This year, the provinces in the Southwest Region will continue to distribute free agricultural implements worth 38 billion yuan, and ethnic minority farmers will continue to receive more than 1 million pieces of agricultural implements of various sizes. The distribution of free agricultural implements has greatly improved the backward farming techniques of ethnic minorities, triggering a series of changes in production in these areas; at the same time, it has greatly increased the enthusiasm of ethnic minority farmers for production.

In the minority agricultural areas where land system reform has been completed, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been widely carried out. By the end of 1953, 77.32 percent of farm households in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were organized, with 187 agricultural production cooperatives. In Xinjiang, about 30 percent of farm households were organized in 1953, with 10 agricultural production cooperatives. In the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi Province, 13 percent of farm households were organized. In the Miao, Dong, Buyi and other ethnic regions of Guizhou Province, the number of organized farm households generally reached 30 percent of the total number of farm households. In 1954, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in various regions was further developed. For example, in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the number of organized farm households has reached 55.8 percent of the total number of farm households by this summer.

The "Basic Summary of Animal Husbandry Production in Several Pastoral Areas in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan, Qinghai, Xinjiang and Other Places" published by the Government Administration Council played a great guiding role in the work of ethnic minority areas and animal husbandry production. In the past year, animal husbandry has developed greatly, and the number of livestock has increased rapidly. For example, the number of livestock in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region increased by nearly one and a half times by 1953 compared with the early days of liberation, an average annual increase of 14.5 percent.

The forests in ethnic minority areas account for a large proportion of the country's total forest reserves. The state has carried out large-scale forestry development in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; carried out subtropical forestry cultivation in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region; and provided assistance for afforestation in private forest areas in the Central South, Southwest and other ethnic minority areas.

Some ethnic minority areas have begun industrial construction. For example, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has more than 200 local state-owned and cooperative factories of various sizes, and some modern industries have also been newly built in Xinjiang Province. Some of the state's basic construction projects are located in ethnic minority areas. During the construction process, the local people of all ethnic groups gave great support.

In the past year, the policy of ethnic regional autonomy has been further implemented. The "Basic Summary of the Experience of Promoting Ethnic Regional Autonomy" published by the Third (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Government Administration Council in 1953 played a great role. As of the end of May this year, 26 ethnic autonomous regions at the county level or above have been established nationwide. Among them, eleven are equivalent to the special zone level. Together with the previous ones, 58 ethnic autonomous regions at the county level or above have been established nationwide.

Many autonomous regions have conducted universal suffrage, and some have also convened people's congresses at all levels of the autonomous regions, thereby further strengthening the connection between the autonomous organs and the people.

The various ethnic autonomous regions have made significant progress in realizing the nationalization of the organs of ethnic autonomy. First of all, a large number of local ethnic minority cadres have been trained and promoted, further enriching the autonomous organs. In the practice of actual work, these cadres are active, enthusiastic, and have promoted the advantages of connecting with the masses, and have made great progress. Autonomous organs in all autonomous regions that already have ethnic scripts have generally paid attention to using ethnic languages ​​as the main tools for exercising state power. In many areas, Han cadres have also actively learned local ethnic languages, which has been of great help in carrying out work. Some autonomous regions have paid attention to arranging the lives of the organs internally according to local ethnic characteristics. Some autonomous regions have stipulated the financial powers of the autonomous regions, and have implemented them after being approved by the central government. Under the leadership of the local party and government organs, some autonomous regions have established ethnic people's local armed forces. The leadership of the higher-level people's governments over the autonomous regions is generally paying more attention to ethnic characteristics than in the past. Due to the nationalization of the autonomous organs, the connection between the autonomous organs and the people has been strengthened, and they have received the love and support of the people of all ethnic groups.

In the past year, the cultural and educational work in ethnic minority areas has also developed. In terms of school education, primary school education has developed rapidly, and the number of ethnic minority students in secondary schools and universities is also increasing. Since their establishment, the seven national minority colleges across the country have graduated more than 7,600 students. In order to develop ethnic minority education, the state allocated 90.9 billion yuan in subsidies for ethnic minority education in 1953, an increase of six times compared with 1951. In addition, certain achievements have been made in social education and the publishing of ethnic minority texts.

The state is very concerned about the health work of ethnic minorities. There are now 51 hospitals in ethnic minority areas. More than 700 county health centers and many district health centers, epidemic prevention stations, and maternal and child health stations have been established in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities; the central government and relevant major administrative regions and provinces have successively organized 48 ethnic health work teams to conduct medical treatment in various ethnic minority areas. All regions have paid attention to training ethnic minority health workers. In 1953, the state allocated more than 227 billion yuan in subsidies for ethnic minority health undertakings, more than double that of 1952.

In addition to these tasks, people's governments at all levels have also done a lot of important work in strengthening and consolidating ethnic unity. In the period from September 1952 to October of last year, a general inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies was carried out in all regions of the country, focusing on criticizing the Han chauvinism that existed among some Han cadres and people, and also educating the cadres and people of ethnic minorities. In areas where disputes existed between and within ethnic groups, the relevant party committees and people's governments cooperated with local leaders and religious figures who had contact with the people to vigorously carry out persuasion and education and mediation of disputes. Some areas also negotiated unity and security conventions and established unity and security organizations to prevent or reduce the recurrence of disputes. Due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' cruel persecution, some Kazakh people who had been scattered for a long time in the border areas of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces and whose lives were extremely difficult have been resettled, and the people's government has helped them solve the necessary means of livelihood and means of production. These tasks have direct benefits and great significance for strengthening and consolidating ethnic unity.

The many achievements of ethnic work in the past year have been achieved under the deep concern and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of party committees and people's governments at all levels, through the close unity and joint efforts of the people of all ethnic groups and ethnic minority cadres and leaders who are connected with the people. All nationalities in our country have united into a free and equal national family. In the future, on the basis of promoting friendship and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups, opposing imperialism, opposing the people's enemies within all ethnic groups, and opposing Han chauvinism and local nationalism, the ethnic unity of our country will continue to be strengthened.

    编者按：中华人民共和国宪法草案序言中说：“我国各民族已经团结成为一个自由平等的民族大家庭。……国家在经济建设和文化建设的过程中将照顾各民族的需要，而在社会主义改造的问题上将充分注意各民族发展的特点。”宪法草案总纲中又规定：“中华人民共和国是统一的多民族的国家。各民族一律平等。禁止对任何民族的歧视和压迫，禁止破坏各民族团结的行为。各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由，都有保持或者改革自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰的自由。各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治。各民族自治地方都是中华人民共和国不可分离的部分。”第二章第五节又对民族自治地方的自治机关作了规定。
    宪法草案中的这些规定，是以已经存在的事实为根据的。四年多以来，我们国家正确执行了中国共产党的民族政策，我国各民族已经在平等的基础上空前地团结起来了；各个少数民族地区都逐渐改变了旧的面貌，在政治上、经济上和文化上出现了欣欣向荣的新气象。宪法草案中的规定，正是反映了中华人民共和国成立以后所出现的新的民族关系和新的气象，把过去四年多以来民族工作的经验和成果用立法形式总结起来，固定下来了。从下面发表的几篇文章中可以看出几年来我们国家在民族工作方面获得的许多成就。
    一年来的民族工作
    中央人民政府民族事务委员会宣传组
    过去一年，在国家过渡时期的总任务及其组成部分国家在民族问题方面的任务的指导和鼓舞下，民族工作有了更进一步的进展。各民族地区的经济建设工作，提到了重要的地位。民族区域自治政策的继续推行，获得了新的成就。在凡是有条件进行普选的少数民族地区的各族人民都热烈地参加了普选。各民族干部的培养和各民族地区文教卫生事业的建设，都获得许多成绩。全国各民族的团结更加亲密和巩固了。
    一年来，各有关地方人民政府在中央人民政府的正确领导下，对发展少数民族地区的经济事业，都作了极大的努力。特别是农业、牧业、林业方面，成绩更加显著。各民族人民的物质和文化生活相应地有了改善和提高。
    少数民族地区的农业生产水平一般已恢复到战前水平，有的地区已超过战前最高水平。不少的过去缺粮的地区，现在不但已能自足，有些并且有了余粮。
    为了帮助少数民族人民发展农业生产，人民政府发放了农业贷款，生产补助金，供应了农具，兴修了水利，并特别在一些生产极端落后的地区，发放了无偿的铁质农具。如西南区去年打制了各种农具一百三十多万件，到年底已发出九十多万件。受益的少数民族农民仅贵州一省即达十四万户。今年西南区各省将继续发放价值三百八十亿元的无偿农具，各少数民族农民将可继续得到一百多万件大小农具。无偿农具的发放，大大地改进了少数民族的落后的耕作技术，引起了这些地区生产上一系列的变化；同时大大地提高了少数民族农民的生产积极性。
    在完成了土地制度改革的少数民族农业区，已普遍地开展了互助合作运动。到一九五三年底止，内蒙古自治区组织起来的农户占总农户的百分之七十七点三二，有农业生产合作社一百八十七个。新疆一九五三年组织起来的农户约占农民总户数百分之三十以上，有农业生产合作社十个。广西省桂西僮族自治区组织起来的农户占总农户的百分之十三。贵州省苗、侗、布依等民族地区组织起来的农户，一般的已达到农民总户数百分之三十。一九五四年各地区互助合作运动又有了进一步的开展，如桂西僮族自治区到今年夏组织起来的农户已占总农户的百分之五十五点八。
    政务院公布的“中央人民政府民族事务委员会第三次（扩大）会议关于内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地若干牧业区畜牧业生产的基本总结”对少数民族地区工作和畜牧业生产起了很大的指导作用。一年来，畜牧业有很大发展，牲畜头数增加很快。如内蒙古自治区的牲畜头数，到一九五三年较解放初期增加了近一倍半，平均每年可增加百分之十四点五。
    少数民族地区的森林，在全国森林蓄积量中占很大比重。国家在内蒙古自治区进行了大规模的林业开发；在海南黎族苗族自治区进行了亚热带林业的垦植；在中南、西南等少数民族地区，对私有林区的造林也给予了扶助。
    有些少数民族地区已开始了工业建设，如内蒙古自治区已有地方国营及合作社经营的大小工厂二百多个，新疆省也新建了一些现代化的工业。国家基本建设工程有的就在少数民族地区。在工程进行中，当地各族人民给予了极大的支援。
    一年来，民族区域自治政策得到进一步的贯彻。一九五三年政务院公布的中央民族事务委员会第三次（扩大）会议关于推行民族区域自治经验的基本总结起了极大的作用。到今年五月底止，全国继续建立了县级以上的民族自治区二十六个。其中相当于专区级的十一个。连同以前，全国已建立了五十八个县级以上的民族自治区。
    许多自治区进行了普选，有的并召开了自治区的各级人民代表大会会议，因而更进一步加强了自治机关和人民群众的联系。
    各民族自治区在实现民族自治机关民族化方面，有了显著的进展。首先是大量培养和提拔了当地民族干部，更加充实了自治机关。这些干部在实际工作的锻炼中，积极、热情，发扬了联系群众的优点，有了很大的进步。凡是已有民族文字的自治区的自治机关，一般均已注意了运用民族语文作为行使政权的主要工具。在许多地区，汉族干部并积极地学习当地民族语文，对开展工作有很大帮助。有些自治区在机关内部注意到根据当地民族特点安排机关生活。有些自治区对自治区的财政权限已有所规定，经中央批准后并已付诸实施。有些自治区，在当地党政机关的领导下，建立了民族的人民地方武装。上级人民政府对自治区的领导，一般地比过去更注意了民族特点。由于自治机关的民族化，更加强了自治机关和人民群众的联系，得到各族人民的爱护和支持。
    一年来，少数民族地区的文化教育工作也有发展。在学校教育方面，小学教育发展较快，中等学校和高等学校的少数民族学生也在增加。全国七个民族学院自成立以来，已毕业的学生有七千六百多人。国家为发展少数民族教育事业，一九五三年拨发少数民族教育事业补助费九百零九亿元，比一九五一年增加了六倍。此外在社会教育和少数民族文字的出版事业方面也有一定的成绩。
    国家对少数民族的卫生工作是非常关怀的。现在少数民族地区有五十一所医院，在少数民族聚居的地区已建立了七百多个县卫生院和许多区卫生所、防疫站、妇幼保健站；中央和各有关的大行政区、省先后组织了四十八个民族卫生工作队深入各少数民族地区进行医疗。各地区都注意培养少数民族的卫生工作人员。一九五三年国家拨给少数民族卫生事业补助费两千二百七十多亿元，比一九五二年增加了一倍多。
    除了这些工作以外，各级人民政府在加强和巩固民族团结方面还做了许多重大的工作。从一九五二年九月到去年十月的一年多的时间中，在全国各地区普遍地进行了民族政策执行情况的检查，着重地批判了一部分汉族干部和人民中存在的大民族主义思想，同时也教育了少数民族的干部和人民。在存在着民族之间和民族内部的纠纷的地区，各有关党委和人民政府都协同当地与人民有联系的领袖人物和宗教界人士，大力进行了说服教育和调解纠纷的工作，有些地区并商订了团结治安公约，成立了团结治安组织，防止或减少了纠纷的再起。由于过去国民党反动派残酷的迫害，长期流散在甘、青、新三省边境地带，生活极端痛苦的一部分哈萨克族人民已得到安置，人民政府帮助他们解决了必要的生活资料和生产资料。这些工作对加强和巩固民族团结，都有着直接的利益和重大意义。
    一年来民族工作的这许多成绩，是在中国共产党、中央人民政府、毛主席的深切关怀和正确领导下，在各级党委和人民政府的直接领导下，经过各民族人民和各民族干部及与人民有联系的领袖人物紧密团结、共同努力而获得的。我国各民族已经团结成为自由平等的民族大家庭。今后在发扬各民族间的友爱互助、反对帝国主义、反对各民族内部的人民公敌、反对大民族主义和地方民族主义的基础上，我国的民族团结将继续加强。
