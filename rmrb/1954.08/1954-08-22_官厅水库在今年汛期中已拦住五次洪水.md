Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, August 21st: Since the beginning of the flood season, the Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River has held back five floods. As of the 17th, the reservoir has stored 130 million cubic meters of floodwater. The Guanting Gorge has become a wide lake. Currently, floods from the upper reaches of the Yongding River's tributaries continue to flow downstream, but after entering the Guanting Gorge, they are blocked by the majestic dam and intake tower, and the rapid floodwaters quietly settle in the reservoir.

From June 28th to the end of July this year, four floods occurred in the upper reaches of the Yongding River, with river flows ranging from 500 cubic meters per second to 1,115 cubic meters per second. However, each flood was blocked by the Guanting Reservoir. The flood on July 21st had a flow of 800 cubic meters per second rushing in, but with the control of the reservoir's structures, it was reduced to a flow of 25 cubic meters per second, passing slowly downstream through the aqueduct. On August 9th, another flood with a flow of 1,230 cubic meters per second slammed into the gorge. At this time, the eight steel gates of the intake tower were tightly closed, and the flood could only flow downstream through a small side tunnel at a flow of 67 cubic meters per second. This reduced the flood at Lugou Bridge and other areas downstream of the Yongding River from 700 cubic meters per second to 410 cubic meters per second, thereby ensuring the safety of the riverbank.

    官厅水库在今年汛期中已拦住五次洪水
    据新华社保定二十一日电：进入汛期以来，永定河官厅水库已拦住五次洪水。到十七日止，水库里已拦蓄了一亿三千万公方的洪水。官厅山峡成了一个宽阔的湖泊。目前，永定河上游各支流洪水仍继续下泄，但流入官厅山峡后便被巍峨的拦河坝和进水塔阻挡住，湍急而下的洪水静静地停留在水库里。
    今年六月二十八日到七月底，永定河上游各河曾发生四次洪水，河水流量由五百秒公方到一千一百一十五秒公方。但是每次洪水都被官厅水库挡住。七月二十一日的一次洪水有八百秒公方的流量汹涌而来，但遇到水库建筑物的控制，却把它变成二十五秒公方的流量，通过输水道，慢慢地向下流去。八月九日，又一次流量一千二百三十秒公方的洪水向山峡猛扑，这时进水塔的八个钢铁闸门紧闭，洪水只能通过一个小支洞以六十七秒公方的流量流向下游。这样，就使永定河下游芦沟桥一带的洪水由七百秒公方减到四百一十秒公方，从而保障了沿河堤岸的安全。
