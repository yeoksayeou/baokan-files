To meet the needs of the capital's large-scale infrastructure construction and the people in the new districts, China Department Store Beijing Company has recently added four temporary sales outlets in the new urban area, the eastern suburbs, and the northern suburbs. It is now stepping up the construction of houses and preparing to establish four stores.

Starting from July 20th, Beijing Department Store began building sales sheds in four locations: Guandongdian East of Dongdaqiao in the eastern suburbs, Hepingli in the northern suburbs, Shawocun in the new urban area, and Wanshoulu. Four temporary sales outlets are being established and have gradually begun operations.

Beijing Department Store supplies goods according to the different target groups in each district. In the Shawocun area of the new urban area and other areas in the eastern suburbs, which are areas where construction workers are concentrated, high-top rubber shoes, sneakers, flashlights, batteries, light bulbs, cigarettes, and candies are supplied. The eastern suburbs are areas where light industrial workers are concentrated, and many of them are female workers. The department store specifically supplies a large number of printed fabrics, floral shirts, cologne, talcum powder, mirrors, sock covers, and lightweight cloth shoes. In the northern suburbs and the new urban area, where cadres from government agencies and troops and students are more concentrated, daily necessities, knitwear, stationery, and candies of better quality are supplied.

Since the opening of each sales outlet, they have been welcomed by the masses. Many female comrades from the troops, who were originally planning to go to the city to buy things, bought children's clothing, printed fabrics, and towels as soon as they saw that the department store had come to the suburbs. Nearby farmers were also able to buy cloth and daily necessities. They all said: The department store has come to the countryside, saving us travel expenses and time for shopping. It is really thoughtful.

    中国百货公司北京市公司增设四个郊区临时售货处
    为了适应首都大规模基本建设和新建区人民的需要，中国百货公司北京市公司最近在新市区、东郊和北郊等区增设了四个临时售货处，现正加紧修建房屋，筹备设立四个门市部。
    从七月二十日开始，北京市百货公司就在东郊关东店东大桥东、北郊和平里、新市区沙窝村、万寿路四处修建售货棚，建立四个临时售货处，现已陆续开始营业。
    北京市百货公司根据各区不同的对象供应商品。在新市区沙窝村和东郊等地区，是建筑工人集中的地区，就供应高统胶鞋、球鞋、手电筒、电池、灯泡、纸烟和糖果等。东郊区是轻工业工人集中的地区，其中有很多是女工，百货公司特供应大批花布、花衬衣、花露水、爽身粉、镜子、袜套和轻便的布鞋等。在机关部队干部和学生较集中的北郊、新市区，供给质量较好的日用百货、针棉织品、文具和糖果等。
    各售货处自开始营业以来，已受到群众的欢迎。许多部队女同志，本来准备进城买东西，一看到百货公司到郊区了，就选购了童装、花布、毛巾。还有附近的农民，也能买到布匹和日用品。都说：百货公司下乡了，我们买东西又省车钱、又省时间，真是想得太周到了。
