International Public Opinion Supports Our People's Liberation of Taiwan
    Soviet "Pravda"
    "Pravda's" Beijing correspondent, M. Domogatskykh, stated in an article on August 27th about Taiwan being an inseparable part of Chinese territory that, after the Geneva Conference, the United States has been trying its best to piece together aggressive blocs in Asia. American generals are now paying special attention to Taiwan.
    There are now more and more articles in American newspapers revealing that the United States will never allow Taiwan to be handed over to the People's Republic of China. The American ruling class is unwilling to recognize the People's Republic of China's sovereignty over Taiwan. Besides military and strategic reasons, there is another reason. Because once they recognize this right, they will have to cut off all relations with the Kuomintang bandit gangs entrenched in Taiwan. This is not in line with the plans of the American reactionary forces, who intend to use Chiang Kai-shek to maintain tension in the Far East.
    Domogatskykh recalled that the Kuomintang army, supported by the American armed forces, has recently intensified its harassment activities on the southeast coast of China.
    The Chinese people know that peace is threatened by the Kuomintang bandit gangs, and for the Kuomintang bandit gangs, inciting a new world war has become a profession.
    The American imperialists' occupation of Taiwan Island has undermined the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the People's Republic of China and created tension in the Far East. Therefore, the Chinese people are unanimously determined to liberate Taiwan. No conspiracy by the enemies of peace will stop the Chinese people from completing this noble historical task.
    "Democratic Korea" and "Korean Minbo"
    Pyongyang newspapers published commentaries supporting the joint declaration by the democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China for the liberation of Taiwan.
    The "Democratic Korea," the organ of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, published a commentary on the 26th entitled "The Solemn Declaration of the Chinese People," saying, "All the Korean people and peace-loving people of the world express their full support and warm solidarity with this just demand of the Chinese people. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan will be another blow to the aggressive plans of American imperialism in Asia, and it will make a great contribution to the struggle of the Asian people for peace and independence."
    The "Korean Minbo," the organ of the North Korean Democratic Party, published an editorial on the 27th saying that the joint declaration by the democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China for the liberation of Taiwan not only shows the firm will of the great Chinese people to liberate Taiwan for the sake of China's security and territorial integrity and to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, but also shows the common desire of all Asian people who oppose imperialist aggression.
      "Berliner Zeitung"
      The "Berliner Zeitung" published a commentary in its weekly international review column on the 28th entitled "Taiwan Belongs to China," stating that the Chinese people demand the elimination of the den of traitors entrenched on Taiwan Island. This den also constitutes a threat to world peace. Eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is the natural right of the Chinese people, and liberating Taiwan is an internal affair of China, because Taiwan Island belongs to China politically and historically. The commentary said that the people of Taiwan have been persisting in the liberation struggle. The commentary cited the uprising of the people of Taiwan in February 1947, which proved to the world that they would never willingly submit to the rule of the American imperialist running dogs. The commentary said that millions of residents of Taiwan sympathize with the People's Government. "Chiang Kai-shek's reign of terror and the military machine equipped by the United States and trained by American officers cannot change this situation. The Chinese people deeply know that liberating Taiwan is their task and will help the residents of the island return to their motherland."
    Indian "New Age" Weekly
    The latest issue of the Indian "New Age" weekly published an editorial supporting the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. The editorial thoroughly exposed the American conspiracy of aggression in this region and accused the United States of undermining the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. The editorial pointed out that due to the Korean armistice and the Geneva Conference reaching an agreement on the ceasefire in Indochina, the aggressive activities of American imperialism and the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gangs have intensified.
    The editorial said that the United States has completely dominated Taiwan militarily, politically, and economically, attempting to use the Kuomintang lackeys to maintain a constant military threat against the People's Republic of China. The American aggressor bloc supports the piratical acts of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits.
    The editorial said: "All these activities are blatant provocations against the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of Asia and the world. The American aggressor bloc is undermining China's territorial integrity and sovereignty, interfering in China's internal affairs, and increasing the threat of war in the Far East, deepening international tension, and thus preventing China and other relevant countries from enjoying the benefits of peace through these activities and supporting Chiang Kai-shek."
    The editorial said that only by liberating Taiwan can peace in Asia and the world be guaranteed. The editorial expressed full support and sympathy for the Chinese people's struggle for the complete victory of the noble cause of national liberation and unification.
    British "Peace News"
    The British "Peace News" wrote about the Chinese people's desire to liberate China's Taiwan Island: "Without a doubt, the Allied countries once jointly passed a resolution stipulating that Taiwan Island should be returned to China after defeating Japan. At present, the fact that Chiang Kai-shek, supported by the United States, maintains armed forces in Taiwan and uses Taiwan as a base for hostile propaganda and possible military activities against the Chinese mainland is a serious provocation against the legitimate government of China."
    The newspaper called for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. The newspaper wrote: "We once again demand that the Beijing government be immediately allowed to join the United Nations as a member with full rights."

### 各国舆论支持我国人民解放台湾

专栏：

    各国舆论支持我国人民解放台湾
    苏联“真理报”
    “真理报”驻北京记者莫·多莫加茨基赫二十七日在一篇关于台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分的文章中说，在日内瓦会议以后，美国竭力在亚洲拼凑侵略集团。美国将领们现在特别注意台湾。
    在美国的报纸中现在有越来越多的文章透露，美国决不让台湾交给中华人民共和国。美国统治集团不愿意承认中华人民共和国对台湾的主权，这除了军事战略上的原因外，还有另外一个原因。因为一旦承认了这种权利，他们将不得不从此断绝和现在盘踞在台湾的国民党匪帮的一切关系。而这正是和美国反动势力的打算不符合的，他们打算利用蒋介石来保持远东的紧张局势。
    多莫加茨基赫追述道，由美国武装部队支持的国民党军队，最近加紧对中国东南沿海的骚扰活动。
    中国人民知道，和平遭受着国民党匪帮的威胁，对国民党匪帮来说，煽动新的世界大战已变成了一种职业。
    美国帝国主义者占领台湾岛，破坏了中华人民共和国的领土的完整和主权，并在远东造成紧张局势。因此，中国人民一致决心要解放台湾。和平敌人的任何阴谋，都将阻挡不了中国人民完成这个崇高的历史任务。
    “民主朝鲜报”和“朝鲜民报”
    平壤报纸发表评论，支持中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府机关报“民主朝鲜报”二十六日以“中国人民的严正宣言”为题发表评论说，“全体朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，对中国人民的这个正当的要求表示完全的支持和热烈的声援。中国人民解放台湾的斗争将是对美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略计划的又一打击，这将对亚洲人民争取和平和独立的斗争作出伟大的贡献。”
    北朝鲜民主党机关报“朝鲜民报”在二十七日发表社论说，中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言，不但表明了伟大的中国人民为了中国的安全和领土完整，为了保障亚洲及世界和平而一定要解放台湾的坚决意志，而且表明了反对帝国主义侵略的全体亚洲人民的共同愿望。
      “柏林日报”
      “柏林日报”二十八日在每周国际评论栏中以
  “台湾是属于中国的”为题发表评论说，中国人民要求消灭盘踞在台湾岛的卖国贼巢穴。这个巢穴同时也构成了对世界和平的威胁。消灭蒋介石匪帮乃是中国人民当然的权利，解放台湾是中国内部的事情，因为台湾岛在政治上和历史上都是属于中国的。评论说，台湾人民一直坚持着解放斗争。评论举出一九四七年二月台湾人民的起义，向全世界证明了他们决不甘心受美帝国主义走狗的统治。评论说，台湾数百万居民同情人民政府。“蒋介石的恐怖统治以及由美国装备和美国军官训练的军事机器也不能改变这种情况。中国人民深知解放台湾乃是他们的任务，并将帮助岛上的居民重返他们的祖国。”
    印度“新世纪”周报
    最新一期的印度“新世纪”周报发表支持中国人民解放台湾的一篇社论。社论彻底地揭露了美国在这个地区的侵略阴谋，并指责美国破坏开罗宣言和波茨坦公告。社论指出，由于朝鲜停战和日内瓦会议达成印度支那停火协定，美国帝国主义和台湾国民党匪帮的侵略活动已经加紧了。
    社论说，美国在军事、政治和经济上完全霸占了台湾，企图利用国民党走狗来保持针对中华人民共和国的经常的军事威胁。美国侵略集团支持蒋介石匪徒的海盗行为。
    社论说：“所有这些活动都是明显的反对中国人民以及亚洲和全世界的爱好和平的人民的挑衅活动。美国侵略集团正通过这些活动和支持蒋介石，来破坏中国的领土完整和主权，干涉中国的内政，并且在远东增加战争威胁，加深国际紧张局势，从而阻止中国和其他有关国家享受和平的利益。”
    社论说，只有解放台湾，亚洲和全世界的和平才能得到保障。社论表示完全支持和同情中国人民为争取全国解放和统一这一崇高事业的彻底胜利而进行的斗争。
    英国“和平新闻”
    英国“和平新闻”就中国人民要解放中国的台湾岛一事写道：“毫无疑问，盟国曾经共同通过一项决议，规定在击溃日本以后把台湾岛归还给中国。目前，美国支持的蒋介石在台湾保持着武装力量，并利用台湾作为对中国大陆进行敌意宣传和可能的军事活动的基地，这件事实是对中国合法政府的严重的挑衅行为。”
    报纸要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。报纸写道：“我们再一次要求立刻允许北京政府加入联合国作为享有全部权利的会员国。”
