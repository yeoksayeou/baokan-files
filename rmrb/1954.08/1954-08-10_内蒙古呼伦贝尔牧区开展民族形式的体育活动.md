    Inner Mongolia Hulunbuir League pastoral areas are widely developing ethnic sports activities. Since the beginning of July, various pastoral banners have successively held Nadaam festivals, carrying out activities such as wrestling, horse racing, archery, and equestrian performances. In Xin Barag Right Banner, Chen Barag Banner, and Solon Banner alone, more than 700 herders, cadres, and students participated in various competitions.
    This year, some banners have newly added events such as mounted archery, children's wrestling, and women's horse racing to the sports competitions. These newly added events are very popular among herders. In Xin Barag Right Banner, thirty-two children under the age of fifteen participated in wrestling. They were praised by the audience and veteran wrestlers during the competition. The women's horse race in Chen Barag Banner was both intense and exciting, and Mandula, a seventeen-year-old herding woman, won second place in the horse race. (Xinhua News Agency)

    内蒙古呼伦贝尔牧区开展
    民族形式的体育活动
    内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟牧区普遍展开民族形式的体育活动。从七月初旬以来，各牧业旗先后举行那达慕大会，进行了摔跤、赛马、射箭、马术表演等活动。仅新巴尔虎左翼旗、陈巴尔虎旗、索伦旗三地参加各项比赛的牧民、干部和学生，就有七百多人。
    今年有些旗在体育比赛中，新增加了骑射、儿童摔跤比赛和女子赛马等项目。这些新增加的项目都很受牧民的欢迎。新巴尔虎左翼旗有三十二个十五岁以下的儿童参加摔跤。他们在比赛时，得到观众和老摔跤手的称赞。陈巴尔虎旗的女子赛马既紧张又精彩，一位十七岁的牧民妇女满都拉，在赛马中荣获第二名。　　　（新华社）
