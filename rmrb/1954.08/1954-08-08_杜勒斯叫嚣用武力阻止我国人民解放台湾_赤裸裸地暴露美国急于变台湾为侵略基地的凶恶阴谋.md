Xinhua News Agency, 6th. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly stated at a press conference in Washington on the 3rd that the United States would use force to prevent the Chinese people from liberating their homeland's territory, Taiwan. In his speech, Dulles completely ignored the fact that Taiwan is an integral part of China's sacred territory and brazenly said, "The United States, through its navy and air force, undertakes the responsibility of protecting Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from attacks by the Communists." Dulles also reiterated that the United States is negotiating a bilateral military treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, and is also "studying" the issue of establishing an aggressive alliance composed of Taiwan's Chiang bandits, South Korea, and Japan.

Dulles's choice of this moment to issue this statement demonstrates that after the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, the U.S. ruling clique is eager to turn Taiwan, occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, into a major base for attacking the Chinese mainland and promoting its Far East aggression policy.

Anyone with a clear head cannot fail to see the enormous danger to peace in the Far East and the world contained in this policy, which is doomed to bankruptcy. This policy is that the U.S. ruling clique, on the one hand, uses its naval and air power to protect the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan; on the other hand, it intensifies military activities in Taiwan and uses the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang to constantly invade the Chinese mainland in an attempt to subvert our people's regime. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson nakedly stated at the beginning of this year that the U.S. policy is to continuously maintain a military threat to the new China from Taiwan, and ultimately restore the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang to power on the Chinese mainland. A July 27th editorial in the "Washington Post" pointed out that the military treaty that the United States is preparing to conclude with the Chiang bandits is "based on this policy concept." At present, the United States is accelerating its military deployment in Taiwan and intensifying its preparations for military aggression against China. According to a report by U.S. columnist Robert Allen on the 4th, the United States "has already taken significant military measures" in Taiwan. Allen revealed that the U.S. "Navy has been ordered to patrol the entire Chinese coast," and the U.S. military deployment in Taiwan "will extend to include the Penghu Islands—a string of islands between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland," and the United States "has established a combat command in this forward area." At the same time, the United States is storing weapons and military supplies originally designated for the Indochina battlefield in Taiwan. These sinister arrangements, with their spearhead pointed at China, prove that the U.S. ruling clique, after repeated setbacks, is willing to take the most ferocious measures to be forever hostile to the 600 million Chinese people.

The Chinese people have repeatedly stated that liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair and no country has the right to interfere. Taiwan is Chinese territory, which is not only determined by historical facts and previous international agreements, but also recognized by the whole world. Even the U.S. State Department had to admit in its propaganda instructions of December 23, 1949, that "Taiwan is politically, geographically, and strategically a part of China." Fair-minded public opinion around the world believes that liberating Taiwan, eliminating the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and restoring the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty are the sacred rights of the Chinese people. The U.S. ruling clique's attempt to overturn the fact that Taiwan is Chinese territory and interfere with the Chinese people's right to liberate Taiwan under any pretext is intolerable to justice and public opinion.

    杜勒斯叫嚣用武力阻止我国人民解放台湾
    赤裸裸地暴露美国急于变台湾为侵略基地的凶恶阴谋
    【新华社六日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯三日在华盛顿记者招待会上公开表示：美国将以武力阻止中国人民解放祖国的领土台湾。杜勒斯在谈话中根本不提台湾是中国神圣领土的一部分的事实，竟蛮横地说：“美国通过它的海军和空军承担保护台湾和澎湖列岛之责，使其不受共产党的攻击。”杜勒斯还再一次表明，美国正在和蒋介石残余匪帮谈判缔结双边军事条约，同时，也正在“研究”成立由台湾蒋匪、南朝鲜和日本组成的侵略联盟的问题。
    杜勒斯选择这个时机来发表这一声明，说明了美国统治集团在日内瓦会议就恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议以后，急于要把蒋介石残余匪帮盘踞下的台湾变成进攻中国大陆和推行其远东侵略政策的主要基地。
    一切头脑清醒的人，都不能不看到美国这个注定要归于破产的政策所包含的对远东和世界和平的极大危害性。这个政策就是，美国统治集团一方面利用它的海空力量庇护蒋介石匪帮，阻止中国人民解放台湾；另一方面，又在台湾加紧军事活动，利用蒋介石残余匪帮不断进犯中国大陆，妄图颠覆我国人民政权。美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊今年年初曾经赤裸裸地表示美国的政策就是要从台湾不断保持对新中国的军事威胁，最后使蒋介石卖国匪帮在中国大陆复辟。七月二十七日的“华盛顿邮报”社论指出，美国准备与蒋匪缔结的军事条约正是“以这种政策概念为基础”。目前，美国正在台湾加速军事部署，加紧准备对中国的军事侵略活动。据美国专栏作家罗伯特·艾伦四日报道，美国在台湾“已经采取了重大的军事措施”。艾伦透露，美国“海军已奉令到整个中国沿海进行巡逻”，美国在台湾的军事布置“要延伸到包括澎湖列岛——台湾和中国大陆之间的一串岛屿”，美国“已在这个前进地区成立了作战司令部”。同时，美国还把原来指定用于印度支那战场的武器和军需品储存在台湾。这些矛头指向中国的阴谋布置，证明美国统治集团在屡遭挫败之后，不惜采取最凶恶的措施，永远与六亿中国人民为敌。
    中国人民已一再申明：解放台湾，是中国的内政，任何国家，无权干涉。台湾是中国的领土，这不但为历史事实和历次国际协定所确定，而且为全世界所公认。甚至美国国务院在一九四九年十二月二十三日的宣传指示中也不得不承认“台湾在政治上、地理上和战略上都是中国的一部分”。全世界的公正舆论认为解放台湾、肃清卖国贼蒋介石、恢复中国领土主权的完整，是中国人民的神圣权利。美国统治集团不管在什么借口下企图推翻台湾是中国领土的事实，干涉中国人民解放台湾的权利，都是正义和公理所不容的。
