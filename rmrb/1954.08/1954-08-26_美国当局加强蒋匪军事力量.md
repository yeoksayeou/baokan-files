Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: U.S. authorities are taking various measures to strengthen the military forces of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

According to United Press, the United States has recently shipped "enough parts to build two hundred boats" to Taiwan. Shipyards under the control of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are accelerating the construction of vessels in an attempt to intensify harassment and destructive military operations against mainland China. U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Moev, Administrator of the Mariana Islands, and Brigadier General Kadala, Commander of the U.S. Third Air Division, arrived in Taiwan on the 22nd. It is revealed that they will "conduct important discussions" with the heads of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army and the U.S. military leaders stationed in Taiwan. At the same time, the U.S. Pacific Fleet Command will also dispatch senior officials to Taiwan to "complete" the conspiracy plotted between U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Stump and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang not long ago during Stump's visit to Taiwan.

    美国当局加强蒋匪军事力量
   【新华社二十三日讯】美国当局正采取各种措施加强蒋介石卖国集团的军事力量。
    据合众社报道，美国已在最近把“足供建造二百艘船艇之用的零件”运到了台湾，蒋匪帮控制下的造船厂正在加速建造船只，企图加强对中国大陆进行骚扰性和破坏性的军事行动。美国马里亚纳群岛行政长官墨弗海军少将和美国第三空军师师长卡达拉准将在二十二日从关岛到达台湾。据透露，他们将同蒋匪军头目和美国驻台湾的军事首脑“进行重要的讨论”。同时，美国太平洋舰队司令部也将派遣高级官员到台湾去，以“完成”不久以前去台湾的美国太平洋舰队司令斯图普和蒋匪帮之间策划的阴谋。
