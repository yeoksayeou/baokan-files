    The Soviet Agricultural Exhibition for Over a Week
    For over a week since the opening of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, millions of Soviet working people and foreign guests have visited this magnificent agricultural city located in the northern suburbs of Moscow. As of the 6th, 22 foreign delegations had visited the Agricultural Exhibition. Currently, the organized number of visitors in each visiting group to the exhibition exceeds 16,000 per day.
    Every day, the squares, boulevards, and exhibition halls of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition are crowded with visitors. They visit the "Grain Pavilion," the "Potato and Vegetable Pavilion," the "Livestock Pavilion," and the "Agricultural Electrification and Mechanization Pavilion" with great interest. In the first three days since the opening of the exhibition, over 40 visiting groups from other places visited the "Grain Pavilion" alone. In the "Grain Pavilion," the audience was very interested in an exhibition stand explaining Soviet grain varieties and breeding. The commentators explained to them that the Soviet Institute of Plant Cultivation has collected 70,000 kinds of grain seeds. Now, Soviet scientists are using these seeds to cultivate new varieties with high yields per unit area.
    Thousands of people visited the various exhibition rooms of the "Russian Federation Pavilion." Visitors often lingered in front of the exhibition stands for a long time to understand the industrial and agricultural growth of this largest republic of the Soviet Union. The exhibition also holds reports and seminars to help visitors learn advanced agricultural production experiences and new achievements in agricultural science. Representatives of various republics, many heroes of socialist labor, and advanced agricultural workers met each other at the exhibition and exchanged their production experiences. Farmers' delegations from Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and other republics carefully studied the cotton planting experience of advanced cotton-growing farms in the Uzbek Republic. In the "Uzbekistan Pavilion," they met the famous breeder and hero of socialist labor, Niyazov. This cotton-growing expert harvested an average of 78 quintals (one quintal equals 200 jin) of cotton per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu) in 1947 and 93 quintals of cotton in 1950. In the "Kazakhstan Pavilion," sugar beet growers from the Ternopol Oblast met with their counterparts from the "October" collective farm in the Dzhambul Oblast. Suleimanov, a hero of socialist labor and the leader of the field work team of the "October" collective farm, introduced his method of growing sugar beets. Last year, this collective farm planted a total of 240 hectares of sugar beets, with a yield of 514 quintals per hectare. After the conversation, the collective farmers in the two places also decided to launch a socialist labor competition with each other. (Xinhua News Agency)

    一个多星期以来的苏联农业展览会
    苏联农业展览会开幕一星期多来，千百万苏联劳动人民和外国的客人们已参观了这座位于莫斯科北郊的雄伟的农业城。截至六日为止，已有二十二个外国代表团参观了农业展览会。现在，每天到展览会去的各个参观团有组织的参观人数在一万六千人以上。
    每天，苏联农业展览会的各个广场上，林荫道上和展览馆里，都挤满了观众。他们以极大的兴趣参观“谷物展览馆”、“马铃薯和蔬菜展览馆”、“畜牧业展览馆”和“农业电气化和机械化展览馆”。在展览会开幕以来的头三天内，单是参观“谷物展览馆”的就有四十多个从外地来的参观团体。在“谷物展览馆”中，观众们对一个说明苏联谷物品种和育种情况的展览台很感兴趣。讲解员向他们说明，苏联植物培育研究所收集有七万种谷物种子。现在苏联科学家们正利用这些种子培育单位面积产量很高的新品种。
    数以千计的人参观了“俄罗斯联邦展览馆”的各个展览室。参观者在展览台前常常停留很久，以便了解苏联这个最大的加盟共和国的工农业增长情况。展览会上并举办报告会和座谈会，帮助参观者学习先进的农业生产经验和农业科学新成就。各个加盟共和国的代表们，许多社会主义劳动英雄和农业先进工作者们，在展览会上彼此会面，交流了自己的生产经验。塔吉克、吉尔吉斯、土库曼等共和国的农民代表团，仔细研究了乌兹别克共和国先进植棉农庄的植棉经验。他们在“乌兹别克展览馆”内会见了有名的选种家、社会主义劳动英雄尼雅佐夫。这位植棉能手一九四七年在每公顷（合十五市亩）土地上平均收获了七十八公担（一公担合二百市斤）棉花，一九五零年收获了九十三公担棉花。在“哈萨克展览馆”内，特尔诺波尔州的甜菜种植者和江布尔州“十月”集体农庄的同行会面。社会主义劳动英雄、“十月”集体农庄的田间工作组组长苏列曼诺夫向人们介绍了自己种植甜菜的方法。去年这个集体农庄共种了二百四十公顷甜菜，每公顷收获了五百一十四公担甜菜。经过交谈以后，两地的集体农民还决定彼此展开社会主义劳动竞赛。　（新华社）
