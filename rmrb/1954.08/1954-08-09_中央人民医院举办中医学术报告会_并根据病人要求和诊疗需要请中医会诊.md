    Central People's Hospital Holds Traditional Chinese Medicine Academic Conference, Invites TCM Consultations Based on Patient Requests and Treatment Needs

    The Central People's Hospital has successively held academic reports on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and acupuncture therapy, and invited TCM doctors to the hospital for consultations.

    On August 4th, the hospital held its first acupuncture therapy report meeting, with Sun Zhenhuan from the Beijing TCM Training School lecturing on acupuncture therapy operations. More than 200 doctors and nurses from the entire hospital participated in the report meeting. Acupuncture therapy report meetings will continue to be held.

    In order to learn from TCM, the Central People's Hospital began inviting Zhu Yan, the Director of Academic Affairs of the Beijing TCM Training School, to give academic reports on TCM in April. The report meeting has been held three times so far. The report content includes the general principles of syndrome differentiation and treatment in classical Chinese medicine, the theoretical basis of TCM, and TCM's understanding and treatment of neurasthenia, gastric ulcer, and other diseases. Zhu Yan's report analyzed the academic and treatment experience of TCM using scientific methods, which was well received by the listeners.

    The Central People's Hospital has begun inviting TCM doctors for consultations since January of this year, based on patient requests and treatment needs. Famous TCM doctors Kong Bohua and Li Zhensan have been invited to the hospital for consultations, and the consultation results have been quite good. Through consultations, medical staff have gradually attached importance to traditional Chinese medicine. The Central People's Hospital is now mobilizing all medical staff to further study TCM in a planned way and strengthen TCM work within the hospital.

    中央人民医院举办中医学术报告会
    并根据病人要求和诊疗需要请中医会诊
    中央人民医院陆续举办中医学术和针灸疗法报告会，并请中医到院会诊。
    八月四日，院里举办第一次针灸疗法报告会，由北京中医进修学校的孙振寰主讲了针灸疗法操作。全院有医师、护士二百多人参加了报告会。针灸疗法报告会还要连续举行。
    为了向中医学习，在四月间，中央人民医院就开始聘请北京中医进修学校教务主任朱颜作中医学术报告。到现在报告会已举行过三次，报告内容有中国古典医学中关于症候治疗的一般规律和中医的理论基础，中医对神经衰弱、胃溃疡病等症的认识和治疗。朱颜的报告用科学方法分析了中医的学术和治疗经验，很受听讲者的欢迎。
    中央人民医院根据病人要求和诊疗需要，从今年一月起已开始请中医会诊。著名中医孔伯华、李振三都曾被邀来院会诊，会诊效果相当好。经过会诊，医务人员已逐渐重视祖国医学。中央人民医院现正发动全院医务人员进一步有计划地学习中医，并加强院内中医工作。
