Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: Singapore dispatch: Mrs. Pandit, speaking in Singapore on the 15th, reiterated that the People's Republic of China should have its legitimate rights in the United Nations restored and that peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems is practically feasible.

Mrs. Pandit said that restoring China's legitimate position in the United Nations would help ease tensions. She said that as long as China is excluded from the United Nations, the United Nations will have many problems.

Mrs. Pandit said: Regardless of whether the government of the People's Republic of China is recognized by foreign countries and whether it is a member of the United Nations, it must be consulted on all issues concerning the future of Asia, just as in Geneva. She said: "Without China's participation, it would have been impossible to resolve the Indochina issue in Geneva."

Referring to India's refusal to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization conference, Mrs. Pandit said that India does not need foreign military "aid", but only non-aggression treaties and peaceful regions.

Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: TASS Cairo, August 16th: According to the "Rose el Yusuf" weekly, Yemeni Minister to London, Hassan Ibrahim, told the magazine's reporter that the Yemeni government "fully supports and heartily welcomes the proposal to recognize Communist China."

The Yemeni Minister said that the issue should be treated realistically, and since the Beijing government undoubtedly represents the majority of the Chinese people, this government cannot but be recognized.

The Yemeni Minister advocated that all Arab countries recognize the People's Republic of China.

    潘迪特夫人重申应恢复我在联合国的地位
    也门驻英公使主张一切阿拉伯国家都承认我国
    【新华社十七日讯】新加坡消息：潘迪特夫人十五日在新加坡发表谈话，再次表示中华人民共和国应恢复在联合国中的合法权利，并认为政治和社会制度不同的国家和平共处是实际可行的。
    潘迪特夫人说，恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位会有助于缓和紧张局势。她说，只要中国被排斥在联合国之外，联合国就会存在着许多问题。
    潘迪特夫人说：不管中华人民共和国政府是否为外国所承认，以及它是不是联合国的一个会员国，在有关亚洲前途的一切问题上，都必须和它商量，就像在日内瓦一样。她说：“如果没有中国参加的话，那么在日内瓦就不可能解决印度支那问题。”
    潘迪特夫人在谈到印度拒绝参加东南亚公约组织会议时说，印度并不需要外国的军事“援助”，只需要互不侵犯条约和和平地区。
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社开罗十六日讯：据
  “鲁兹·优素福”周刊报道，也门驻伦敦公使哈桑·易卜拉欣对这家周刊的记者说，也门政府“完全支持和衷心欢迎关于承认共产党中国的主张”。
    也门公使说，应当现实地对待这个问题，既然北京政府毫无疑义地代表大多数中国人民，那就不能不承认这个政府。
    也门公使主张一切阿拉伯国家都承认中华人民共和国。
