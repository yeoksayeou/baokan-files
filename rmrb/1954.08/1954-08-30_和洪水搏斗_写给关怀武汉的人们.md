    Fighting the Flood
    ——Written for People Concerned About Wuhan
    Li Rui
    As I write, the water level at Jianghan Customs is 29.63 meters. This is the highest water level in recorded history. The flood barrier wall along Yanjiang Avenue, which used to be only as tall as a person, has now become a high city wall. The trunks of the large trees on the embankment are buried under piled sandbags, and most of the branches have been sawed off to serve as anti-wave obstacles. Due to the continuous raising and thickening of the embankment, the streets adjacent to the embankment appear much narrower than before. The once smooth-as-a-mirror street surface along the embankment is now surrounded by many inverted filter wells, many inverted filter ditches have been dug, and it is filled with flood control and emergency equipment, and parked with trucks loading and unloading yellow earth, full of a fighting atmosphere.
    The people of Wuhan have suffered from the Yangtze River floods. The great flood of 1931 is a painful memory for the people of Wuhan. At that time, when the water level at Jianghan Customs was only 26.94 meters, the flood broke through the embankment from the Danshuichi area and submerged the three towns of Wuhan. People spent more than four months displaced in several feet of water. At that time, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang did not care about the lives of the people. The materials they invested in repairing the embankment were only "5,000 sacks, 1,000 bamboo baskets, 1,000 reed mats, and 20,000 catties of reeds." Moreover, they falsely reported and embezzled, with corruption at every level. The common people described the embankment repair at that time with four folk rhymes: "Cut the grass and remove the roots, skin and draw the tendons, no soil on the embankment, no pits under the embankment." These four sentences vividly depicted the Kuomintang's treating flood control as a child's play and taking the opportunity to plunder. At that time, when the flood broke through the embankment, reactionary leaders like He Chengjun and Liu Wendao were still playing mahjong at the Water and Electricity Company. After they caused the flood, they took the opportunity to rob the disaster-stricken people of their property, raise prices, and hoard goods for speculation, pushing people's lives into a more painful abyss. Mentioning the flood that year, many elderly people still have some unforgettable terror.
    This year's flood, compared to 1931, is even more frantic and ferocious. From late June to mid-July, it rained almost every day, and the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River also rose sharply at the same time. In mid-July, the water level at Wuhan Customs had already broken through the historical high water level of 28.28 meters. In early August, it continued to rise frantically, reaching 29.30 meters, which was more than two meters higher than the water level when the flood broke through the embankment in 1931. Under such a severe flood threat, how to completely defend the 138-kilometer-long embankment and ensure the safety of Wuhan is an extremely arduous task.
    However, the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the one and a half million people of Wuhan who have stood up will not bow to any difficulties. In order to defend this famous city of the motherland, and to defend this important base of socialist industrial construction, the Party and the People's Government issued a solemn call to the people in late June. The Flood Control Headquarters was quickly established, and an army of 140,000 flood fighters quickly went to the flood control front line, and the 138-kilometer-long embankment became a hot battlefield. PLA soldiers, public security forces, construction workers, porters, electrical workers, suburban farmers, young students, government cadres..., batches went to the flood control front line, organizing a steel army. "Resolutely defeat the flood!" "Run ahead of time!" was the unanimous action slogan of millions of people. Under their strong will, a force that could move mountains and overturn seas was generated, making our embankment a copper wall and iron wall.
    Let us see how the soldiers on the flood control front line are fighting the flood!
    On the Zhanggongdi line, we visited the soil-collecting soldiers at the Chenjiashan and Fenghuoshan soil collection sites. Chenjiashan is an isolated island surrounded by water, and Fenghuoshan is an uninhabited barren mountain with many poisonous snakes. The comrades who were ordered to collect soil here, in order to consolidate Zhanggongdi and run ahead of time, began fighting without having time to arrange food and accommodation. When they first came, they only ate one meal in a day and a night. At night, there were no sheds, so they slept back to back, with rain cloths over their heads, in the pouring rain. The digging soldiers on Fenghuoshan carried soil in the wind and rain during the day, and fought poisonous snakes at night. But they did not think it was bitter, and were full of optimism. They built their own tents and dug drainage ditches around the tents. They called the wet and uneven berths "unity beds", allowing people with poor health to sleep in them, and strong people sheltered them from the wind and rain. For several nights, there were storms and heavy rain, and the Zhanggongdi line was very tense. At that time, there were no electric lights, and more than a thousand people were digging and carrying soil in the dark night in the pouring rain. The boat boards were slippery and people could not get on. Many workers and students took off their clothes and put them on the boat boards. The stronger the wind and the heavier the rain, the higher their singing and the faster they carried. On stormy nights, they not only did not reduce their work efficiency, but also overfulfilled their tasks. A shock team usually carried 20 tons of soil every day, but on stormy nights, they carried 49 tons. Many of them had blood on their shoulders, so they padded them with towels. The towels and blood were stuck together, so they padded a piece of clothing on top. The straw sandals were stained with mud and fell off, so they simply threw them away and carried soil barefoot. They said: "Today we are fighting the flood, and soil is guns, cannons, and bullets. The more soil we dig, the more soil we carry, the more guaranteed the victory on the embankment." When the delegation visited them, they wrote letters of determination one after another, saying: "As long as the flood does not recede for a day, we will never withdraw our troops. We will flatten Chenjiashan and Fenghuoshan and move them to Zhanggongdi to stand guard for us."
    We went to Daijiashan to visit the soldiers at the drainage station. They came from all directions, some from the Guanting Reservoir, some from the Huai River project, some from the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and some from the Jingjiang flood area. These people who have been fighting floods for many years mostly received orders one day and arrived in Hankou the next day. Time was short, the task was urgent, and the machines and parts were pieced together from all directions, so there were a series of difficulties from machine installation to power generation and drainage. However, in order to drain the accumulated water in the suburbs, so that the 30,000 disaster-stricken farmers could return home to production as soon as possible, and to open up the road from the city to Daijiashan, so that the rear could support the front more quickly, they immediately united like a family, overcame various difficulties, and installed more than 300 water pumps. Many technicians, electricians, and porters worked in the wind and rain while sick. "Minor injuries do not rest, serious injuries do not leave the line of fire" became everyone's unanimous slogan. In order to rush to install the machine's inlet pipe, it was necessary to clear the weeds in the lake. Many elderly technicians and young workers jumped into the several feet of water, regardless of everything. When the task was urgent, young worker Wang Guangzheng stood in the water from 9:00 in the morning to 12:00 midnight in the pouring rain; Comrade Di Shangde insisted on working in the water for 16 hours. Their lips were frozen purple and their limbs were frozen numb, but they still gritted their teeth and persisted in their work. When visiting them, they said very modestly: "In order to drain the accumulated water and save tens of thousands of disaster-stricken farmers, Chairman Mao sent us train generators from thousands of miles away. If we relax for a minute or a second, we will be sorry for Chairman Mao!" With their selfless efforts, 336 water pumps with a total of more than 10,700 horsepower were quickly installed. Rows of water tanks, three clusters of one and five groups of faucets sucked the accumulated water onto the high embankment and poured it into the heart of the river like thousands of waterfalls.
    Our PLA soldiers always stand on the front line in any struggle. In this struggle against the flood, they have shown the spirit of revolutionary heroism even more highly. Late at night on July 26, the wind roared, the rain poured, and the waves rolled up four or five feet high, impacting the embankment. A leak occurred in a section of Jin'yintan, and most of the embankment was cut away. Soldier Chen Chiliang heard about the dangerous situation late at night, put on his clothes and ran to the embankment. Seeing that the situation was dangerous, he and squad leader Wang Wenju and soldier Wu Renzhong jumped into the water without hesitation, using their feet to step on and their hands to touch, and found three holes the size of bowls. At this time, the emergency rescue equipment had not yet arrived, and they could not stop them even if they took off their clothes. They used their bodies to block the holes without hesitation and persisted until the emergency rescue team arrived. On July 12, the embankment subsided in the lower section of Xujiapeng Railway Station. At that time, the wind was high and the waves were strong, and the river water was surging. For a while, the anti-wave rafts could not be transferred. Seeing that the embankment was about to collapse, Communist Party member Han Desheng and soldiers Wang Zai'ai, Le Shaolin, Xu Yuqing, Zhao Shangyi, Rao Chune and others jumped into the surging river water without hesitation, holding hands, lying on the embankment, hugging the embankment, and using their backs to resist the huge waves of the flood. They persisted in the water for two hours until a large number of sacks were transported to block the holes. Such examples have occurred in almost every work section and every unit. Volunteer soldier Wang Zhenlu, who returned home for recuperation, worked on the embankment. His shoulders were swollen and his legs were injured. Others advised him to rest, but he said: "When I was fighting on Shangganling, I was injured four times and never left the line of fire. We can defeat the American devils, and we will certainly be able to defeat the flood."
    Farmers in the suburbs and cadres in the countryside have played a huge role in the flood control struggle. Due to the long-term continuous rain, many villages and fields in the low-lying areas of the four suburbs were flooded. However, the awakened farmers are no longer pessimistic and disappointed people who succumb to disasters. While producing food under the leadership of the government to tide over the famine, they also signed up in large numbers to the flood control front line to repair the embankment. Yuan Xiuzhen, the female township head of the Cooperation Township and a Communist Party member, was only 18 years old. When the project started, she served as the commander of the section, leading three or four hundred farmers from the township to repair the leaks on the embankment in the rainstorm. At that time, there were no electric lights on the embankment. She ran to the cooperative late at night to borrow dozens of kilograms of kerosene and made torches out of bamboo tubes to start fighting overnight. At that time, she had not yet learned the experience. She took the initiative to hold several forums for old farmers, absorbed their experience, and solved many technical problems. At the most urgent time of the project, she did not sleep for four days and four nights. Her own home was flooded, but for the sake of the embankment, she did not even go back to take a look. Due to long-term combat, she became ill with a high fever, but she still insisted on working in the wind and rain. Such examples are not individual. The farmers of the Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Dongting Township, Wuchang Suburbs, and the farmers of the Tao Songbai mutual aid group proudly stated: For every inch the flood rises, they will raise the embankment by one foot. They said: "Now, our eyes are bright and we can see far. We will not only defend the embankment and protect the industrial base, but also expand the vegetable planting area to support the city and factories."
    On the soil collection sites, the flood barrier walls, and the drainage stations, one can encounter shock teams and service teams organized by young students everywhere. Students from Wuhan University and Central China Normal College invested in the work of digging and carrying soil by the hundreds and thousands. When they first arrived, some people did not even know how to wear straw sandals, and they could not walk steadily when carrying the loads. The worker comrades jokingly called them "white bumpkins". However, after a period of training, the work efficiency of many teams gradually caught up with the worker comrades. Some of them had blood on their shoulders, so they continued to carry them with towels. Some of their feet were cut by stones, so they tore their clothes and wrapped their feet to carry them. They are not only soil collectors and soil transporters, but also propagandists and mobilizers. The stronger the wind and the heavier the rain, the higher their singing and the louder their slogans. The shock team of Central China Normal College went to Chenjiashan to collect soil. The initial task was only ten days, but because the flood continued to rise and the task was urgent, they automatically extended it for more than twenty days and were unwilling to go back. They excitedly said: This vivid lesson in labor education is more effective for their ideological transformation than reading books in school for several years. Young female students from No. 1 Girls' Normal School, No. 1 Girls' Middle School, and No. 5 Girls' Middle School organized "service teams" to support the front, washing clothes, boiling tea, delivering water, and doing condolence work for the flood control army. They launched a five-good (wash well, dry well, repair well, fold well, place well) movement to challenge each other. In places where the sheds were scattered, they divided into groups and carried wooden basins to the sheds to wash. When they first arrived at the construction site, it took them half an hour to wash one piece of clothing. Later, they found tricks, thought of ways, and adopted a flow-line operation method. A group of eleven people could wash the clothes of three hundred workers. Some worker comrades thought that their clothes were "too dirty" and did not ask them to wash them, and secretly hid their clothes. But when they came back from work, their clothes were clean, neat, and placed on the berths, with a letter attached: "Big brothers! If you go to the construction site and there is work that you are not allowed to do, how would you feel?" In this way, the workers quickly regarded them as a family, as their own sisters. Many of them had swollen hands and bloodshot eyes, but they never complained, and sang songs all day long. Their service spirit greatly encouraged the morale of the flood control front line.
    On the more than 100-mile-long flood control front line, there are endless touching examples. Countless meritorious units and countless meritorious individuals are shining in people's eyes like thousands of flower trees. In this fight against the flood, the people have once again proved with their actions that the power of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party can move mountains and overturn seas, and have once again proved that our people's democratic dictatorship system can generate a huge force like a volcanic eruption.
    The city's 1.5 million people are supporting the front with all their strength. Street residents, government cadres, workers, and shop assistants have organized a huge reserve team that can go to the front at any time. Thousands of residents launched a movement to donate broken bricks and tiles. A delegation of nearly a thousand people went to the front line to express their condolences in the wind and rain. Various government agencies and organizations took the initiative to save electricity and send electricity to the flood control front line.
    The central government supports this struggle with a large amount of manpower and materials: when a large number of sacks were needed, it sent millions of sacks; when the power supply could not keep up, train generators were sent from thousands of miles away; in order to drain the accumulated water, a large number of technicians and hundreds of water pumps were transferred from all over the country; in order to effectively carry out emergency rescue, the air force sent planes to carry naval diving personnel; in order to quickly raise the embankment to block the flood peak that rises sharply every day, yellow earth from thousands of miles away in the north and south flew to Wuhan by train, and even Sichuan pickles, Henan melons and fruits... continuously supplied blood to the fighting Wuhan.
    Floods have not been seen in eighty or ninety years, but today, it has encountered new opponents. Such a huge force of "people" is also something that the Yangtze River has never encountered in its history? Comparing the two, the flood appears very small.
    Someone who has just arrived in Wuhan or has been away from Wuhan for a long time, if they come here to take a look, will be amazed by the huge scale of this battle. Look, the more than 100-kilometer-long embankment, which used to be riddled with holes, has now generally become wider and higher. Many sections can accommodate two cars side by side. In the past, the embankment was dark at night, with only a few fireflies, but now, tens of thousands of electric lights have turned the long embankment into a brilliant and dazzling sea of stars, illuminating every place as if it were daytime; hundreds of cars are running day and night, and countless barges are shuttling back and forth transporting materials; sections of tightly connected anti-wave log rafts protect the embankment like a long dragon, resisting the rapid winds and furious waves; emergency rescue teams and patrol teams are patrolling day and night, eliminating the flood wherever it sneaks in. On the other side, the drilling work of the Yangtze River Bridge continues, and a section of the steel bridge of the Han River Bridge will grow longer in a few days. In the past, there was a myth in ancient legends that "water keeps rising and mountains keep getting higher." That was just people's imagination, but today, "water keeps rising and embankments keep getting higher" has become a miracle created by people with their own hands. Anyone who participates in this battle will be full of confidence in "man will conquer nature" and full of pride in our heroic era and heroic people.
    Now, the water level of the flood is still quite high, and this struggle will continue for a considerable period of time. The 1.5 million people of Wuhan are fighting the flood to the end with the spirit of Wu Song fighting the tiger. People understand that the closer we get to the final victory, the more arduous the struggle will be. However, comrades who care about Wuhan can be comforted that there is an absolute guarantee of finally defeating the flood, because standing behind the embankment are people with socialist consciousness. "Never withdraw troops until the flood is finally defeated!" is the cry from the bottom of the hearts of millions of people. This voice and this power itself is a copper wall and iron wall that the flood will never break through. August 15

    和洪水搏斗
    ——写给关怀武汉的人们
    李蕤
    当我执笔的现在，江汉关的水位，是二九点六三公尺。这是有水文纪录以来历史上的最高水位。沿江大道的拦江墙，从前只不过一人高，如今变成高高的城墙了。堤上的大树的树干，被堆起的麻袋掩埋得看不见了，树枝也大半被锯掉了，成为防浪的鹿砦。由于堤不断加高加厚，临堤的街道显得比从前窄了许多。过去平滑如镜的沿着堤的街面，如今圈起了许多倒滤井，挖了许多倒滤沟，堆满了防汛和抢险的器材，停满装卸黄土的汽车，充满战斗的气氛。
    武汉市的人民，是受过长江洪水的灾难的。一九三一年的大水灾，武汉人民有惨痛的记忆。那时候江汉关的水位只有二六点九四公尺的时候，洪水便从丹水池一带破堤而入，淹没了武汉三镇。人民在几尺深的水里，过了四个多月流离失所的生活。当时国民党反动统治是不顾人民死活的，他们那时为修堤投入的物力，只有“麻袋五千条，畚箕一千挑，芦席一千条，芦柴二万斤。”而且是浮报贪污，层层舞弊。老百姓形容那时候的修堤，有四句歌谣，叫做“剪草除根，剥皮抽筋，堤上无土，堤下无坑。”这四句话，把国民党以防汛为儿戏，而且乘机搜刮的情形描写得淋漓尽致。当时洪水破堤的时候，反动头子何成浚刘文岛之流还在水电公司打麻将。他们在纵水成灾之后，更乘机抢掠灾民财物，高抬物价、囤积居奇，把人民的生活推入更加痛苦的深渊。提起那一年的水灾，许多老年人还有些难以忘掉的恐怖。
    今年的洪水，和一九三一年相较，是更加疯狂、更加凶猛了。从六月下旬到七月中旬，几乎天天在下雨，长江上下游的水也在同时暴涨。七月中旬，武汉关的水位已经突破二八点二八的历史最高水位，八月上旬，更连续疯狂的上涨，达到二九点三○公尺，和一九三一年洪水破堤时候的水位比较，高出了两公尺还多。在这样严重的洪水威胁下，如何把一百三十八公里的长堤完全守住，确保住武汉市的安全，这是万分艰巨的任务。
    但是，共产党、人民政府，和站起来的一百五十万武汉人民，是不向任何困难低头的。为了保卫这座祖国的名城，为了捍卫这社会主义工业建设的重要基地，党和人民政府在六月下旬便向人民发出庄严的号召。防汛总指挥部很快的成立了，十四万防汛大军，很快的开到防汛前线，一百三十八公里的长堤，变成了火热的战场。解放军战士，公安部队，基建工人，搬运工人，电业工人，郊区农民，青年学生，机关干部……，一批批开上防汛前线，组织起一支钢铁的队伍。“坚决战胜洪水！”“跑在时间前面！”是千万人一致的行动口号，在他们的坚强意志下，产生了移山倒海的力量，使我们的堤防成为一条铜墙铁壁。
    让我们看看，防汛前线的战士们，是怎样在和洪水作斗争吧！
    在张公堤一线，我们曾访问陈家山、烽火山两个采土场的采土战士们。陈家山是个四面临水的孤岛，烽火山更是没有人烟的荒山，山上还有不少的毒蛇。奉命到这里采土的同志们，为了巩固张公堤，为了跑在时间前面，没有来得及安排吃住的条件，便开始了战斗。他们刚来的时候，一天一夜只吃了一餐饭，晚上没有工棚，就背靠着背，头顶着雨布，在瓢泼一般的大雨中过夜。烽火山的掘土战士，白天冒着风雨挑土，晚上还要和毒蛇作斗争。但是他们不以为苦，充满乐观主义的情绪，他们自己搭起帐棚，在帐棚四围挖了排水沟。他们称既潮湿而又高低不平的铺位叫“团结床”，让身体不好的人睡在里面，身体强壮的人在四围替他们遮风挡雨。有好几夜，狂风暴雨，张公堤一线非常紧张，当时还没有装上电灯，一千多人，就在漆黑的夜色中冒着大雨挖土挑土。船板滑，人上不去，许多工人和学生就脱下自己的衣服，垫在船板上，风越大雨越大，他们的歌声愈高，挑得越快。在暴风雨的夜晚，他们不仅没有减低工作效率，反而超额完成了任务，一个突击小组，平日每天挑土二十吨，但暴风雨的夜晚，却挑了四十九吨。他们许多人肩膀磨得出了血，就用毛巾垫着，毛巾和血沾在一起，就在上面垫一件衣服，草鞋被泥沾掉了，就干脆扔掉草鞋，赤着脚挑土。他们说：“今天我们和洪水作战，土就是枪炮子弹，我们多挖一筐土，多挑一担土，堤上的胜利便多一分保障。”在慰问团访问他们的时候，他们纷纷写决心书表示：“只要一天洪水不退，我们就决不收兵，我们要把陈家山和烽火山铲平，把它移到张公堤上，让他替我们站岗。”
    我们曾到戴家山，访问排水站的战士们。他们是从四面八方赶来的，有些来自官厅水库，有些来自治淮工地，有些来自黄河上游，有些来自荆江洪区，这些长年和洪水决斗的人们，多半是头一天接到命令，第二天就赶到汉口来的。时间短，任务急，机器和零件又是四面八方拼凑来的，从机器安装到发电排水，有一系列的困难。但是，为了排出市郊的积水，为了使三万被灾的农民早日回家生产，为了打通从市区通到戴家山的公路，使后方更迅速的支援前方，他们立刻团结得像一家人一样，克服种种困难，把三百多架抽水机安装起来。很多技工、电工、搬运工带着病在风雨里工作。“轻伤不休息，重伤不下火线”，成为大家一致的口号。为了赶装机器的进水管，需要清除湖里的杂草，许多年老的技工，青年工人，不顾一切，跳到几尺深的水里。在任务紧急的时候，青年工人王光正，冒着大雨，从早晨九点钟站在水里，一直坚持到深夜十二点钟；狄尚德同志，一直在水里坚持了十六个小时。他们的嘴唇被冻紫了，四肢冻得失去知觉，但仍咬牙坚持着工作。慰问的时候，他们很谦逊的说：“为了排除积水，救几万受灾的农民弟兄，毛主席几千里外替我们派来了列车发电机，如果我们放松一分一秒的时间，可对不起毛主席呀！”在他们奋不顾身的努力中，拥有一万零七百多匹马力的三百三十六部抽水机很快的安装起来了，一排一排的水槽，三个一簇五个一组的水龙头，把渍水吸上高堤，像千百条瀑布一样，向江心里倾泄。
    我们的解放军战士，在任何斗争中，都是站在第一线的，在这次和洪水的斗争中，他们更高度表现了革命英雄主义的气概。七月二十六日深夜，狂风怒号，大雨倾盆，浪花卷起四五尺高，冲击着堤岸，在金银滩一段有一个地方出了漏洞，堤身被切下去大半。战士陈池亮，深夜听到发生险情，披着衣服便往堤上跑，看到情势危险，就和班长王文举战士伍仁仲奋不顾身的跳到水里，用脚踩，用手摸，找到了三个碗口大小的漏洞，这时抢险的器材还没有运到，他们脱下衣服来塞也塞不住，他们就毫不迟疑的用自己的身体，堵住漏洞，坚持到抢险大队赶来。七月十二日徐家棚车站下段一带，堤身下陷，当时风高浪大，江水汹涌，一时防浪排调不到，眼看堤防便要倒坍，共产党员韩德盛和战士王在才、乐少林、徐育卿、赵尚义、饶楚能等，就不顾一切，跳到波涛滚滚的江水里，手牵着手，伏在堤岸上，抱着堤岸，用他们的脊背抵挡住洪水的巨浪，一直在水里坚持了两个小时之久，一直坚持到大批的麻袋运来堵住漏洞。像这样的事例，几乎每一个工段，每一个部队里都曾发生过。归国休养的志愿军战士王振禄在堤上工作，肩膀压肿了，腿碰伤了，别人劝他休息，他说：“我在上甘岭作战的时候，曾受过四次伤也没下过火线。我们能打败美国鬼子，一定也能打败洪水。”
    城郊的农民，乡村的干部，在防汛斗争中发挥了巨大的作用。由于长时间的霪雨，四郊低洼的地方，不少村庄和田地被水淹没。但是已经觉悟了的农民，再也不是悲观失望，向灾荒屈服的人了，他们一面在政府领导下生产渡荒，一面还大批报名到防汛前线抢修堤防。合作乡的女乡长、共产党员袁秀珍，年纪才十八岁，在工程一开始的时候便担任该段的指挥，率领全乡三四百农民，冒着暴风雨，抢修堤上的漏洞，当时堤上还没有电灯，她深夜跑到合作社借煤油十几斤，用竹筒子做成火炬，漏夜开始战斗；当时还没有摸到经验，她主动几次召开老农座谈会，吸取他们的经验，解决很多技术问题；在工程最紧急的时候，她四天四夜没有睡觉，自己的家被积水淹了，为了堤防，连回去看看也没有。由于长期的战斗，她累病了，发着高烧，仍然风里来雨里去的坚持工作。像这样的例子，并不是个别的。武昌郊区东亭乡灯塔农业合作社的农民，陶松柏互助组的农民，都非常自豪地表示：洪水涨一寸，他们就把堤加高一尺。他们说：“如今，我们的眼睛亮了，看得远了，我们不但要守住堤防，保卫工业基地，还要扩大种菜面积，来支持城市和工厂。”
    在采土场上，拦江墙上，排水站上，随处都会碰到青年学生组织成的突击队和服务队。武汉大学、华中师范学院的学生们，成千成百的投入挖土挑土的工作。刚到的时候，有些人连草鞋还不会穿，担起挑子摇摇摆摆走不成路，工人同志开玩笑喊他们叫“白侉子”，但是，经过一个时间的锻炼，不少小组的工作效率，渐渐也赶上了工人同志。他们有的肩膀磨得出血了，就用毛巾垫着继续挑，有的脚被石块划破了，就撕破衣服把脚包起来挑。他们不仅是采土员和运土员，而且是宣传员和鼓动员，风越大，雨越大，他们的歌声就越高，口号就越响。华中师范学院的突击队到陈家山采土，最初任务只有十天，但是因为洪水不断涨，任务急，他们自动延长了二十多天，还不肯回去。他们兴奋地说：这一课活生生的劳动教育，对于自己的思想改造，抵过在学校读好几年书。一女师、一女中、五女中的年轻女学生们，组织了支援前方的“服务队”，到工地替防汛大军洗衣服、烧茶送水，做慰问工作。她们提出五好（洗好，晒好，补好，叠好，放好）运动互相挑战；在工棚分散的地方，就分成小组提着木盆到工棚去洗。她们刚到工地的时候，半点钟才能洗一件，以后她们找窍门，想办法，采用流水作业法，十一个人的小组，能洗三百工人的衣服。有些工人同志，嫌自己的衣服“太脏”不叫她们洗，把衣服暗暗藏起来，可是等他们下工回来，衣服干干净净、板板正正的放在铺位上，里面还夹着这样的信：“大哥哥们！如果你们到工地，有工作不叫你们做，你心里是什么滋味？”这样，很快的工人便把她们看成一家人，看成自己的亲姊妹。她们许多人的手磨肿了，眼睛熬红了，但却从不叫苦，一天到晚歌声不绝。她们的服务精神，大大鼓舞了防汛前线的士气。
    在一百多里的防汛前线上，动人的事例是写不尽的。无数的立功单位，无数的立功个人，像千万株花树一样耀着人的眼睛。在这一次和洪水的搏斗中，人民又一次用自己的行动证明，在共产党领导下人民的力量是可以移山倒海的，又一次证明，我们人民民主专政制度，可以产生出火山爆发般巨大的力量。
    全市一百五十万人民，以所有的力量支援着前方，街道居民、机关干部、工人店员，组织有庞大的后备队，随时可以开到前方。成千上万的居民展开献破砖烂瓦的运动。近千人的慰问团冒着风雨到前线慰问。各机关团体主动节约用电，把电力送到防汛前线。
    中央以大批的人力物力支援这个斗争：在大量需要麻袋的时候，送来了以百万计的麻袋；在电力供应不上的时候，从几千里外开来了列车发电机；为了排除积水，从全国各地调来了大批技工和几百架抽水机；为了有效的抢险，空军部队派飞机载来了海军部队的潜水人员；为了迅速加高堤防挡住每天猛涨的洪峰，南北千百里外的黄土都坐着火车飞到武汉，连四川的泡菜，河南的瓜果……都源源不断为战斗的武汉输血。
    洪水，是八九十年所没有的，但是，在今天，它碰到了新的对手，这样巨大的“人”的力量，也是长江有历史以来所从来没有遇到过的吧？两相比较，洪水便显得非常渺小了。
    一个初到武汉或者和武汉久别的人，如果到这里看一看，就会惊叹这场战斗规模的巨大。看吧，一百多公里的长堤，过去是千疮百孔，如今普遍变宽了，变高了，许多地段，都可以并行两辆汽车。过去，夜里堤上是黑漆漆的一片，只有点点萤光，如今，成万支的电灯，把长堤变成一个灿烂耀眼的星海，每一个地方都照耀得如同白昼；成百辆的汽车在日夜奔驶着，无数的驳船，穿梭般在来往运输；一节节紧紧连着的防浪木排，像一条长龙般护着堤身，抵挡着急风怒浪；抢险队巡逻队日夜不息地巡视着，洪水从哪里偷袭进来，就在哪里把它消灭。而在另一边，长江大桥的钻探工作，继续在进行，汉江大桥的钢桥，过几天便又长出了一节。过去古代传说里，有“水不断涨，山不断高”的神话，那只是人们的想像，而今天，“水不断涨，堤不断高”却成为人民用自己的手创造出来的奇迹，任何一个人只要参加这个战斗，就会充满“人定胜天”的信心，充满对我们英雄的时代、英雄的人民的自豪感。
    如今，洪水的水位还相当高，而且这一场斗争，也还要持续相当长的时间。一百五十万武汉人民，正以武松打虎的气魄和洪水最后决战。人们懂得越是接近最后胜利的时候，斗争越是艰苦。但是，可以告慰关心武汉的同志们，最后战胜洪水是有绝对保证的，因为站在堤防后面的，是具有社会主义觉悟的人民，“不最后战胜洪水决不收兵！”是千万人心底发出的呼喊，这声音、这力量的本身，就是一道洪水永冲不破的铜墙铁壁。　八月十五日
