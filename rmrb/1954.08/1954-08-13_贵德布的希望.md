It's been more than two years since I last saw that friend who lives deep in the mountains and forests. But as soon as I close my eyes, I think of his characteristic Oroqen wide, protruding cheeks, his sturdy build, and his calm, sharp eyes. This time, hearing that he—Guidebu—had come to Hohhot to represent the Oroqen people at the first session of the First People's Congress of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, I rushed to see him.

The first time I went to find him, he had hurried out to see the sights of Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

That night, I couldn't sleep for a long time. Many old memories flooded my mind, and I recalled the days I spent with my Oroqen friends two years ago.

The place where they lived was truly unforgettable. That place was so remote—on the border of the motherland, almost bordering the great Soviet Union, and yet it was extraordinarily beautiful. The towering mountains were covered with lush, straight trees; clear rivers and streams meandered inside and outside the forests, like crystal ribbons; in the late spring season, the snow on the mountains melted, and colorful wildflowers and exotic plants bloomed in the valleys. Our Oroqen brothers lived in such an environment, riding horses and carrying guns, chasing their prey.

However, what impressed me most was the people who lived there and their life experiences. In the Oroqen's umbrella-shaped "cuoluozi" (tipi) made of wooden poles and hides, I listened intently to people telling their lives and stories. Many of these stories sounded terrible, but that was already the Oroqen's past life.

Before liberation, the Oroqen people had been imprisoned in the mountains and forests by feudal rulers and imperialists for decades, almost isolated from the world. The rulers plundered their valuable furs and prey, giving them only meager coarse cloth and grains, as well as large amounts of drugs and strong alcohol. At that time, disease and death spread in the forests year after year, adults were poisoned, weakening day by day; children could not withstand the measles, and hundreds died. Tragedy, darkness, and death enveloped the entire mountain forest. There was not a trace of freedom or equality to be found there.

I remember one bright moonlit night, I sat beside the woods, quietly listening to an Oroqen old woman singing a song recalling the past. She sang: "Na—yo—yi, one horse after another disappeared, Na—yo—yi, 'bilitan' (hunting guns), and furs are old and broken, children die before they grow up…" Such encounters were common among the Oroqen people before liberation.

From that time on, I deeply fell in love with this fraternal nationality and cared about their fate. When I later heard that they had established an autonomous banner, that they were discussing cooperatives and health clinics at the People's Congress, or that in the capital of the motherland—Beijing—I heard Oroqen dance music being broadcast on the streets, and people asked me about their news, I felt happy and proud for my Oroqen friends.

Two or three years have passed. What changes has national regional autonomy brought to the Oroqen people? Do they hunt more deer, wild boar, and furs? How old are their children?… So many questions, I can only wait until tomorrow for Guidebu to answer me.

The next morning, I finally found Guidebu. The red ribbon of "People's Representative" fluttered on his broad chest, and he exuded a strong, familiar tobacco smell. His face was shining with excitement.

Before I could ask any questions, he began to speak. He said: "Last night I saw many new houses here, which is really gratifying… Our banner also has new constructions this year! Do you remember? We built some new houses a few years ago, but they were still not enough; this year the autonomous banner people's government will build dormitories; cooperatives and health clinics will also increase their buildings. More than ninety workers have already gone to our mountain gully… We also plan to build a highway from Gankui to Tuozhaming…”

He continued to tell me about their production situation. Although he did not give exact figures, he said very confidently: "We hunted more things last year than the year before, and even more this year than last year!" And I knew about their harvest situation the year before. In the winter of 1951 to the spring of 1952, the hunters hunted a total of thirty-eight deer and sable, more than nine thousand gray squirrels, more than five hundred marmot skins, as well as lynx, otter, fox, wolf, and other furs. This was already a considerable number. From this, I could fully imagine the scene of the hunters' harvest in the past two years.

Speaking of life, he said proudly: "In our place, every family has enough to eat and doesn't worry about clothing; in Gankui, people wear more than before. They can't make enough themselves, and they have even set up a tailor shop!" This was really unexpected. The Oroqen people have had their women make their own clothes for generations, and now they want a tailor shop to make clothes for them! What do their clever women do? Guidebu answered this question. He said: "Our men go out hunting, and the women are also busy going to the mountains to pick mushrooms, only the children are left in school to study." Speaking of children, he thought of the school again. He told me that there are now ninety-one students in the local primary school. This number, I remember very clearly, is three times the number of students when the Oroqen people established their school for the first time four years ago.

At this point, he had to go out to visit with other representatives, and I had to shake hands with him to say goodbye. I knew that a short conversation could not answer the many things I longed to know. From his words, I was completely convinced that in the two years of practice of regional autonomy, my Oroqen friends were living very well. They had obtained things they could not have dreamed of for hundreds of years, and they were working together with their Mongolian and Han brothers to build a great motherland and improve their own lives. Everything they have obtained will be recorded in the people's constitution and will be fully guaranteed by the constitution.

When I left our representative, I felt very happy. Goodbye, friend from the deep mountains and forests! One day, I will go to your beautiful place again and share the taste of hunting with you around the campfire. At that time, I will see you have more houses, roads, see you wearing newly sewn exquisite clothes, and groups of bright children.

    贵德布的希望
    胡志霄
    已经有两年多不见那生活在深山密林里的朋友了。可是，只要把眼一闭，我就会想起他那鄂伦春人特有的宽凸的面颊，粗壮的身材，和那沉着敏锐的眼神的。这回，听说他——贵德布已经来到了呼和浩特市，代表鄂伦春族人民出席内蒙古自治区首届第一次人民代表大会会议，我就急于跑去见他。
    当我第一次去找他的时候，他匆忙地上街去了，看一看内蒙古自治区首府呼和浩特市的景色。
    这天晚上，我好长时间不能入眠。许多旧事涌上了心头，我回忆起两年前和鄂伦春朋友们相处的日子。
    他们居住的地方实在叫人留恋。那地方是那么遥远——在祖国的边境，快和伟大的苏联的国土接壤了，而却又出奇的美丽。绵亘的高山峻岭上生长着茂郁的、笔直的树木；清澈的河流、小溪蜿蜒在森林内外，好像一条条水晶带子；在暮春的季节，山上的白雪化尽了，溪谷里开遍了各种颜色的鲜艳的野花奇卉。我们的鄂伦春弟兄们就生活在这样的环境里，骑马持枪，追逐着他们的猎物。
    然而，给我印象最深的，还是生活在那里的人们和他们的生活经历。在鄂伦春人的伞形的、用木杆和皮张搭起的“撮罗子”里，我曾经入神地听人们讲述他们的生活和故事。其中有许多故事，听来十分可怕，但那已是鄂伦春人过去的生活。
    解放前，鄂伦春族人民曾经几十年被封建统治者、帝国主义者禁闭在山林里，几乎与世隔绝。统治者掠夺了他们的贵重的皮张、猎物，给他们的只是不足温饱的粗布和杂粮，以及大量的毒品和烈酒。那时候，疾病和死亡长年地在森林里蔓延，成年人受着毒害，一天天衰弱下去；孩子们经受不住麻疹的侵袭，成百地死去。悲惨、黑暗和死亡笼罩着整个山林。在那里找不见一点自由、平等的影子。
    记得在一个月光皎洁的夜晚，我坐在树林的旁边，静听一位鄂伦春族老妇人唱着一支回忆过去的歌子。她唱道：“纳——哟——伊，一匹匹马儿不见了，纳——哟——伊，‘必力弹’（猎枪）、皮子都旧坏了呀，孩子不等长大就死去了……”。像这样的遭遇，解放以前，在鄂伦春族中间是很多的。
    从那时候起，我就深深地爱上这个兄弟民族，关心着他们的命运了。当我后来听说他们成立了自治旗的时候，听说他们在人民代表会议上讨论着合作社、卫生所的问题，或是在祖国的首都——北京，听见街道上播送着鄂伦春舞曲，人们向我打听他们的消息的时候，我为鄂伦春朋友们感到幸福和骄傲。
    两三年的时间过去了，民族区域自治给鄂伦春族人民带来了什么样的变化？他们打的鹿、野猪、皮子多不多？他们的孩子长的多大了？……许许多多的问题，只有等待明天，让贵德布来答复我了。
    第二天清晨，我终于找到了贵德布。他的宽阔的胸前飘着“人民代表”的红色小条子，身上散发着一股强烈的、我所熟悉的烟草气味。在他的脸上闪着兴奋的光芒。
    他没有等我提出问题，就说起来了，他说：“昨天晚上在这里看见很多新房子，真叫人高兴，……我们旗今年也有新的修建呢！你还记得么？前两年我们盖了一些新房子，但还是不够用的；今年自治旗人民政府要修建宿舍；合作社、卫生所也都要增加房子。九十多个工人已经到我们山沟里去了……。我们还计划从甘奎到托札明修一条公路……。”
    他继续告诉我关于他们的生产情况。他虽然没有提出精确的数目字，可是他十分肯定地说：“去年打的东西比前年多，今年又比去年多了！”而我是知道他们在前年的收获情况的。在一九五一年冬天到一九五二年春天，猎民们就一共打了三十八只鹿和猂、九千多张灰鼠、五百多张元皮，还有猞猁、水獭、狐、狼等皮张。这已经是一笔不小的数字了。从这里我就完全可以推想到这一二年猎民们的丰收的景象。
    谈起生活，他骄傲地说：“在我们那里，家家都有吃的，也不愁穿；在甘奎，人们穿的比以前多了，自己做不过来，还设立了一家成衣铺呢！”这真是想不到的事情，鄂伦春人世世代代都是由他们的妇女做衣裳穿的，而现在，他们要成衣铺给他们做衣裳！他们的心灵手巧的女人们做什么去呢？贵德布回答了这个问题，他说：“我们男人出去打猎，女人们也忙着上山采木耳，只有小孩子才留在学校里念书。”谈起小孩，他又想起了学校，他告诉我现在那里的小学校已经有九十一名学生了。这个数目字，我记得很清楚，正是四年前鄂伦春人第一天设立学校时候的学生的三倍。
    谈到这里，他要和其他代表们一齐出外参观去了，我只得和他握手告别。我知道，一次短时间的谈话，是没法回答我所渴望知道的许多事情的。从他的说话里，我已经完全确信，在两年区域自治的实践中，我的鄂伦春朋友们都生活得很好，他们已经得到了数百年所梦想不到的东西，他们正在和蒙汉弟兄们一齐为着建设伟大的祖国，改善自己的生活而劳动着。他们所得到的一切，都将记录在人民的宪法里，并将得到宪法的充分保证。
    当我离开我们代表的时候，我觉得非常愉快。再见吧，来自深山密林的朋友！总有一天，我会再跑到你们那美丽的地方，和你们围着篝火共尝猎味的。那时候，我将会看到你们有更多的房屋、公路，看到你们穿着新缝制的精致的衣裳，和一群群长得聪颖的孩子们。
