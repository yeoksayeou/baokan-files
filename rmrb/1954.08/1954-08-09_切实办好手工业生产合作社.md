Having convened the Third National Handicraft Production Cooperative Conference, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, convened handicraft work conferences or handicraft representative conferences at various levels across the country. Through these meetings, the situation of production and sales was further understood, production experiences were exchanged, work was examined and summarized, the general task of the country during the transition period and the policy of cooperation were further studied, and plans for the development of handicraft production cooperatives were formulated. Responsible cadres of the Party, government, and cooperatives in various places reached a consensus in their ideological understanding and unified their actions, and strengthened their leadership over the handicraft cooperation movement. The broad masses of handicraftsmen recognized the auxiliary role of handicrafts in the process of socialist industrialization, as well as the necessity of transforming existing handicrafts through the path of cooperation. Their enthusiasm for participating in production cooperation soared, and the cooperation movement gained vigorous development. At the end of 1953, there were 300,609 members of handicraft production cooperatives nationwide. In the first quarter of 1954 alone, 311,525 members were developed, equivalent to 101.6% of the total number of members in the past four years. In the first quarter of 1954, the total value of production completed was over 2 trillion yuan, approximately equivalent to 40% of the total value of production in 1953. This development is in line with actual needs and also meets the requirements of the country's socialist industrialization.

However, on the other hand, several new situations have emerged in the handicraft cooperation movement, bringing about many new problems. For example, while the production of handicrafts is in short supply, the planning of production is insufficient; the development of handicraft production cooperative organizations still has some blindness and spontaneity; some handicraft cooperative organizations rely solely on the state to supply raw materials, help promote sales, and provide loans. These issues need to be appropriately and reasonably resolved based on specific circumstances.

The CPC Central Committee recently approved the "Report on the Third National Handicraft Production Cooperative Conference." The Central Committee instructed that in order to realize the country's socialist industrialization, it is necessary to first concentrate major efforts on developing heavy industry, but it is also necessary to correspondingly develop light industry, local industry, and handicrafts to supplement the insufficiency of state-owned large-scale industrial production and meet the growing needs of the broad masses of people. This is very important and should be given attention by the entire Party. The Central Committee instructed relevant departments to provide necessary assistance to handicraft production cooperatives, take concrete measures, and effectively assist handicrafts in realizing socialist transformation. The Central Committee instructed that we should solve the problem of the Party's organizational leadership, establish administrative management agencies, establish federations of handicraft production cooperatives at all levels, strengthen political work, and dispatch and select capable cadres to participate in the work of handicraft transformation. The Central Committee also pointed out in its instructions that the most urgent and important task at present is to "conscientiously run existing handicraft production cooperatives well, gain experience, and set examples as a necessary preparation for widely carrying out the handicraft cooperation movement." The Party Central Committee's instruction is of great significance for the healthy and large-scale development of the handicraft cooperation movement in the future.

Consolidating and improving existing handicraft production cooperatives is not only for the present, but also for making preparations for larger-scale development in the future. It is necessary for us to vigorously publicize the superiority of handicraft cooperation, but handicraftsmen are very realistic. They will not easily believe or will be half-convinced simply based on our theoretical education and persuasion. Only by running existing production cooperatives well, with the facts in front of them, and using vivid examples to allow handicraftsmen to personally experience the benefits of cooperatives, will they consciously and actively participate in cooperatives.

Adhering to the principle of voluntariness and implementing democratic cooperative building lies in implementing the cooperative's charter. Production cooperatives should strengthen the education of the cooperative charter, because charter education is the foundation of collectivist thought. The work of production cooperatives must be carried out completely in accordance with the charter. For example, the board of directors and the supervisory board must be elected democratically. Only by electing good people who are just and selfless to handle affairs can the cooperative be run well; if the board of directors and the supervisory board are not elected democratically and the leadership of the cooperative falls into the hands of bad people, the cooperative will definitely not be run well and will collapse. The board of directors and supervisory boards of many production cooperatives were not elected by the members' congress, which does not conform to the basic principles of democratic cooperative building. In the rectification struggle in various places, it was absolutely necessary to purge some bad elements from the cooperatives, rectify the ranks, and purify the organization. The board of directors of many production cooperatives do not report to the members' congress and have not fulfilled their responsibilities; production plans are not discussed by the members' congress; the financial expenditure system is chaotic and wasteful; individual responsible persons of production cooperatives even engage in acts of using public office for private gain, embezzlement, and theft. These are serious violations of the principles of economic democracy and national laws. In order to run existing production cooperatives well, the cooperative's board of directors and supervisory board must first establish a work system, report to the members' congress regularly, listen humbly to the opinions of the members, accept the criticism and reasonable suggestions of the members, and actively improve their work. The cooperative's financial expenditures should also establish a system; the production plan should be discussed and approved by the members' congress. Only in this way can democracy be promoted, so that members are all concerned about the development of the cooperative and fight to overfulfill production tasks.

Existing handicraft production cooperatives must concentrate their efforts on doing a good job in production. This is the key to whether production cooperatives can be consolidated and developed. It is very wrong for some production federations to not pay attention to leading the production of grassroots cooperatives. Higher-level cooperatives should go to grassroots cooperatives at any time to check their work, check the degree of completion of the production plan, and improve the discipline and responsibility of production cooperatives in implementing the plan. Going to grassroots cooperatives to check work is not "seeing the flowers while riding a horse, just visiting casually," but to understand the situation, discover problems, solve problems, and improve work. Production cooperatives must improve production technology, ensure product quality, reduce non-production personnel, and reduce production costs. In carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, the Yangquan City Production Federation in Shanxi Province led 22 grassroots cooperatives to reduce 88 non-production personnel, transfer them to workshops to participate in production, which can save 17.5 million yuan in wages every month, and can also increase the production of products worth 88 million yuan. This approach is correct. Handicraft production cooperatives should strengthen business management, strengthen planning, overcome blindness, establish a production responsibility system, and oppose the phenomenon of no one being responsible; starting from the implementation of preliminary quota management work, accumulate experience, and continuously improve to achieve a complete economic accounting system.

In recent years, handicraft production cooperatives in various places have achieved many successes in improving production tools and inventing simple machines, which should be given attention. On the existing basis, improving tools and improving equipment in production cooperatives can promote the improvement of labor organization and operation methods, and can improve labor productivity; it can enable handicrafts to gradually develop towards semi-mechanization and even complete mechanization in the process of cooperation and in the practice of production struggles.

To consolidate and improve existing handicraft production cooperatives, it is necessary to strengthen political leadership and fight against capitalist spontaneous tendencies. In handicraft cooperatives, it is necessary to advocate abiding by credit, implementing contracts, and opposing capitalist business ideas. It is extremely wrong for some production federations to be obsessed with pursuing commercial profits and relax their production leadership over grassroots cooperatives. Some production cooperatives still have serious illegal acts of falsely reporting costs and cutting corners; some members come in the off-season and leave in the peak season, taking it for granted without being stopped. These bad phenomena are fundamentally incompatible with the requirements of the socialist transformation of handicrafts. Some production cooperatives stipulate excessively high wages, and the directors of some production cooperatives consciously pursue the highest wages, creating very unreasonable phenomena, which is also unfavorable to the development of the cooperatives. There are also some handicraft production cooperatives that do not pay attention to expanding public accumulation, and do not have enough socialist components, which is also not conducive to expanding reproduction. The above shortcomings and errors must be overcome in the future.

Production cooperatives are schools for carrying out socialist education. They must give play to the power of collectivism, gradually overcome the backward narrowness and selfishness of small producers, and educate cadres and members to establish an overall concept, oppose localism, and combine the interests of the entire country and all the people with the collective interests of the cooperative, and combine the personal interests of the members with the collective interests of the cooperative. In the process of development, production cooperatives should continuously increase socialist components, gradually change the ownership of the means of production, and change individual ownership into cooperative collective ownership, in order to achieve the goal of moving from individual to collective, from semi-socialist to completely socialist.

### 切实办好手工业生产合作社

    切实办好手工业生产合作社邓洁
    中华全国合作总社召开第三次全国手工业生产合作会议以后，在各级党委领导下，全国各地都召开了各级手工业工作会议或手工业代表会议。通过这些会议进一步了解了产销情况，交换了生产经验，检查和总结了工作，进一步学习了国家过渡时期的总任务和合作化的政策，制订了发展手工业生产合作社的计划；各地党、政和合作社负责干部，达到了思想认识上的一致和行动步骤的统一，并加强了对手工业合作化运动的领导，广大的手工业者认识了手工业在社会主义工业化过程中的助手作用，以及必须通过合作化的道路改造现有手工业的道理。他们参加生产合作的积极性空前高涨，合作化运动获得蓬勃开展。一九五三年底全国共有手工业生产合作社社员三十万零六千六百零九人，一九五四年第一季度内就发展了三十一万一千五百二十五人；相当于过去四年的社员总数的百分之一○一·六。一九五四年第一季度完成生产总值二万亿元以上，约相当于一九五三年全年生产总值百分之四十。这种发展是切合实际需要的，也是符合国家社会主义工业化要求的。
    但在另一方面，在手工业合作运动中，又出现了若干新的情况，带来了不少新的问题。比如，手工业生产一方面是供不应求，而生产的计划性不够；手工业生产合作组织的发展，还存在着若干盲目性和自发性；有一些手工业合作组织单纯的依赖国家供应原料、帮助推销产品和贷款。这些还需要我们根据具体情况加以适当合理的解决。
    中共中央最近批准了“关于第三次全国手工业生产合作会议的报告”。中央指示为实现国家社会主义工业化，应首先集中主要力量发展重工业，同时也必须相应地发展轻工业、地方工业和手工业，以补充国营大工业生产的不足，满足广大人民群众的日益增长的需要，这是非常重要的，应引起全党重视。中央指示各有关部门对手工业生产合作社进行必要的援助，采取具体措施，有效地协助手工业实现社会主义改造。中央指示规定我们要解决党的组织领导问题，设立行政管理机构，建立各级手工业生产联合社，加强政治工作，派遣、选择得力干部参加手工业改造工作。中央指示中并指出目前最为迫切和重要的任务，是要“切实办好现有的手工业生产合作社，取得经验，树立榜样，作为广泛开展手工业合作化运动的必要准备”。党中央的这个指示，对今后手工业合作化运动健康地大量地发展有重大意义。
    巩固和提高现有手工业生产合作社，不仅是为目前，也是为今后更大规模的向前发展做好准备工作。我们大张旗鼓地宣传手工业合作化的优越性是必要的，但手工业劳动者是很现实的，光凭我们从理论上来教育说服他们，他们还是不大相信或者是半信半疑的。只有办好现有的生产合作社，摆在那里，事实俱在，用生动活泼的实例，使手工业者亲身体验到合作社的好处，他们就会自觉地积极参加合作社。
    坚持自愿原则，实行民主建社的关键，在于贯彻执行合作社的社章。生产合作社应该加强社章教育。因为社章教育，是集体主义思想的基础。生产合作社的工作，完全要按照社章办事。例如理事会和监事会必须经过民主选举，只有选举公正无私的好人办事，合作社才能办好；理、监事会如果不经过民主选举，合作社的领导权落到坏人手里，合作社就一定办不好，要垮台。有不少生产合作社的理、监事会不是经过社员大会选举的，不符合民主建社的基本原则。各地在整社斗争中，清洗了一些坏分子出社，整顿了队伍，纯洁了组织，是绝对必要的。有不少生产合作社的理事会不向社员大会作报告，没有尽到自己的职责；生产计划不经过社员大会讨论；财务开支制度混乱，铺张浪费；个别生产合作社理事会负责人还有假公济私，贪污盗窃行为，这些都是严重违反经济民主原则和国家法纪的。为了办好现有生产合作社，合作社理、监事会就必须首先建立工作制度，要定期向社员大会作报告，虚心地听取社员的意见，接受社员的批评和合理化建议，积极地改进工作。合作社的财务开支也要建立制度；生产计划要经过社员大会讨论通过。只有这样，才能发扬民主，使社员都关心合作社事业的发展，为超额完成生产任务而斗争。
    现有的手工业生产合作社必须集中力量搞好生产。这是生产合作社能不能巩固与发展的关键。有些生产联合社不注意领导基层社的生产，是非常错误的。上级社要随时到基层社检查工作，检查生产计划完成的程度，提高生产合作社执行计划的纪律性和责任感。到基层社检查工作，不是“走马看花，随便参观”，而是了解情况，发现问题，解决问题，改进工作。生产合作社必须提高生产技术，保证产品质量，减少非生产人员，降低生产成本。山西阳泉市生产联合社在开展增产节约运动中，领导二十二个基层社减少八十八个非生产人员，转入车间参加生产，每月可以节省一千七百五十万元的工资开支，还能增产价值八千八百万元的产品，这种做法是正确的。手工业生产合作社应该加强经营管理，加强计划性，克服盲目性；建立生产责任制，反对无人负责现象；从实行初步的定额管理工作起，积累经验，不断提高，达到完整的经济核算制。
    几年来各地手工业生产合作社对于改进生产工具和发明简单机械获得不少成绩，应予以重视。生产合作社在现有基础上改进工具，改善设备，可以推动劳动组织和操作方法的改进，可以提高劳动生产率；可以使手工业在合作化的过程中，在生产斗争的实践中，逐步地向半机械化以至完全机械化发展。
    巩固和提高现有手工业生产合作社，必须加强政治领导，与资本主义自发倾向作斗争。在手工业合作社中应该提倡遵守信用，执行合同，反对资本主义经营思想。有些生产联合社醉心于追逐商业利润，放松对基层社的生产领导，是极端错误的。有的生产合作社还存在着虚报成本、偷工减料的严重违法行为；有的社员淡季来，旺季去，习以为常，不加制止。这些不良现象，是与手工业社会主义改造的要求根本不相容的。有些生产合作社规定工资偏高，有些生产合作社的理事会主任有意识地追求最高工资，造成很不合理的现象，对合作社的发展也是不利的。还有些手工业生产合作社不注意扩大公共积累，社会主义成分不多，也不利扩大再生产。以上这些缺点与错误，今后必须努力克服。
    生产合作社是开展社会主义教育的学校，必须发挥集体主义的力量，逐步克服小生产者落后狭隘和自私自利的毛病；教育干部和社员，建立整体观念，反对本位主义，把整个国家和全体人民的利益与合作社集体利益结合起来，把社员个人利益与合作社集体利益结合起来。生产合作社在发展过程中，要不断地增加社会主义成分，逐步地改变生产资料所有制，使个体所有制改变成为合作社集体所有制；以期达到从个体到集体，从半社会主义到完全社会主义的目的。
