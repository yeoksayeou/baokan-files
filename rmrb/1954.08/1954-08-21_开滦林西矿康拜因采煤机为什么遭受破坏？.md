    Why Was the Kailuan Linxi Mine's Combine Coal Mining Machine Damaged?

    On September 7 and December 14, 1953, the Linxi Mine, belonging to Kailuan Coal Mine, experienced consecutive incidents of counter-revolutionary element Zhong Yin sabotaging the combine coal mining machine. How did these incidents happen? Since Zhong Yin was a counter-revolutionary already sentenced to imprisonment, why was he still able to sabotage the combine coal mining machine without hindrance during his probation? Answering this question requires discussing Kailuan Coal Mine's attitude towards Zhong Yin.
    Zhong Yin was a counter-revolutionary element who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. When he was assigned to work at the Linxi Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine in 1949, the principal Party and government leaders of the Linxi Mine discovered that he was a core member of the M.M. group, a secret agent organization of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Andong City, and had maintained considerable vigilance against him. After an investigation by the public security department in 1952 confirmed his past counter-revolutionary activities in Andong and other places, the Tangshan People's Court sentenced him to two years of imprisonment with a suspended sentence. Kailuan Coal Mine still allowed him to work in the Electrical and Mechanical Section of the Linxi Mine. Logically, the Linxi Mine should have been very vigilant about such a person. But this was not the case. The principal Party and government leaders of the Linxi Mine consistently failed to notice or see Zhong Yin's sabotage activities, such as secretly spreading reactionary remarks. They were deceived by Zhong Yin's disguise, only seeing his superficial “active” work, and trusted him considerably.
    In the summer of 1953, the North China Coal Mining Administration notified Kailuan Coal Mine that two Soviet Donbass combine coal mining machines had been allocated to Kailuan Coal Mine, and they were required to send people to Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi to learn the technical operation of the combine machine. The adoption of the combine machine in China's coal mining industry was a significant event. However, the principal Party and government leaders of Kailuan Coal Mine did not pay attention to this event and did not personally oversee it; they only entrusted this important task to the Linxi Mine and rarely inquired or inspected it themselves. After discussion, the Linxi Mine Party Committee decided on the personnel to be sent to Datong for study, among whom the electrical and mechanical technician was Zhong Yin. The Linxi Mine Public Security Sub-bureau believed that it was inappropriate to send a counter-revolutionary who had been sentenced to study, and they had requested instructions from the负责人 (fuzeren, person in charge) of the Kailuan Public Security Office three times. The first two times, the Kailuan Public Security Office also disagreed with sending Zhong Yin to study; but the third time, because the Linxi Mine Party Committee had already made a decision and repeatedly insisted on their opinion, they agreed without principle. After this erroneous decision was made, the administrative department of the Linxi Mine consulted a deputy director of the Kailuan Coal Mine General Management Office, who also did not raise any objections. Neither the Linxi Mine Party Committee nor the Kailuan Public Security Office requested instructions or reported to the Kailuan Party Committee, and the Kailuan Party Committee was unaware of this matter. Only after the incident of the combine machine being sabotaged did the Kailuan Party Committee learn that the electrical and mechanical technician sent to Datong for study was Zhong Yin.
    After the people sent to Datong for study returned, two Soviet combine coal mining machines were transported to the Linxi Mine. The Linxi Mine Party Committee made another mistake by deciding to have Zhong Yin be responsible for the technical work of the combine machine, guiding workers in learning the technical operation of the combine machine. The Linxi Mine Party Committee also did not request instructions or report this erroneous decision to the Kailuan Party Committee, and the Kailuan Party Committee did not inquire or inspect it at all. Thus, the combine machine, which had just been transported from the Soviet Union, fell into the hands of a counter-revolutionary element who had been sentenced and harbored hostility towards the Soviet and Chinese people. On September 7, 1953, Zhong Yin, the "technician" who graduated from the mechanical department of a university, had more than four years of practical experience in mechanical work, and had specialized in studying at Datong, deliberately violated the disassembly sequence specified in the Donbass coal mining combine manual when commanding workers to disassemble the second-stage reduction gear of the coal cutting part of the combine machine training class. He deliberately violated the training class instructor He Daiwen's detailed instructions on disassembling in order, and unscrupulously ordered a dozen workers who did not understand the mechanical structure and operation technology of the combine machine to take turns hammering the center shaft with eight-pound hammers. Some workers tried to stop him, but he completely ignored them, hammering for an hour and a half until he believed the machine was indeed damaged. This was the first answer that the counter-revolutionary criminal Zhong Yin gave to those Kailuan Coal Mine and Linxi Mine Party and government leaders who were underestimating the enemy, paralyzed, and infected with bureaucratic bad habits.
    However, this major sabotage event did not awaken the responsible comrades of the Linxi Mine, and they did not even raise any suspicions. They unconditionally trusted Zhong Yin, completely affirmed that it was a responsibility accident, and did not handle it seriously in a timely manner (even responsibility accidents should be handled seriously. – Editor). Some responsible persons even insisted on their erroneous opinions repeatedly after the facts had been clarified and the superiors had approved the arrest of Zhong Yin. What was the attitude of the Kailuan Party Committee? According to a major responsible person of the Kailuan Party Committee, the main responsible persons of the Party Committee did not have the same completely affirmative view as the Linxi Mine, but they worried that no one could replace his work after Zhong Yin left, so they did not handle it in a timely manner. On September 27, the Linxi Public Security Sub-bureau submitted a report to the Kailuan Public Security Office. On October 30, after investigation, the Kailuan Public Security Office formally submitted a report to the Kailuan Party Committee, and some comrades below also requested the Kailuan Party Committee to convene a meeting to discuss this incident. However, the responsible comrades of the Kailuan Party Committee only discussed it individually and did not formally convene a meeting to study this incident, and they did not respond to the report from below for a long time. It was not until early December 1953, about three months after the occurrence of this sabotage event, that a major responsible person of the Kailuan Party Committee raised several points of suspicion about the report from below and instructed them to continue verifying the facts. At this time, the counter-revolutionary criminal Zhong Yin remained in his original important position, continuing to look for opportunities for sabotage. Before the verification work instructed by the Kailuan Party Committee had yielded results, on December 14, 1953, Zhong Yin once again used the workers' weakness of not understanding installation technology and deliberately adopted the wrong working method, damaging the combine coal mining machine, while commanding the workers to connect the coal cutting part and the electric part of the combine machine underground.
    It is not difficult to see from these circumstances before and after the incident that the serious underestimation of the enemy and paralysis in the leadership of the Kailuan Coal Mine and the Linxi Mine and the corrupt bureaucracy were the main reasons why the counter-revolutionary element Zhong Yin was able to continuously sabotage the combine machine without hindrance. This is a lesson that we should deeply remember.

    开滦林西矿康拜因采煤机为什么遭受破坏？
    本报记者  林洪
    一九五三年九月七日和十二月十四日，开滦煤矿所属的林西矿连续发生了反革命分子钟茵破坏康拜因采煤机的事件。这事件是怎样发生的呢？钟茵既然是一个早已被判处徒刑的反革命犯，为什么他还能在缓刑期间又无阻碍地破坏了康拜因采煤机呢？回答这一个问题，要从开滦煤矿对钟茵的态度谈起。
    钟茵是一个混进革命阵营的漏网反革命分子。一九四九年他被分配到开滦煤矿的林西矿工作时，林西矿的党政负责人发现他是蒋匪安东市秘密特务组织M·M·团的骨干分子，曾经对他保持着相当的警惕。一九五二年经公安部门调查，证实他以前在安东等地进行反革命活动的事实以后，唐山市人民法院曾经判处他有期徒刑二年，缓期执行。开滦煤矿仍然留他在林西矿机电科工作。按理说，对于这样的人，林西矿应该是很警惕的。但事实不是这样，林西矿的党政负责人一直不注意也看不见钟犯暗中散布反动言论等破坏活动，他们被钟茵的伪装所蒙蔽，只看见他表面上工作“积极”，对他就相当信任。
    一九五三年夏天，华北煤矿管理局通知开滦煤矿，说拨给开滦煤矿两台苏联顿巴斯康拜因采煤机，并要他们派人到山西大同煤矿学习康拜因机的技术操作。在我国的煤矿工业上采用康拜因机，这是一个富有重要意义的事件。但是开滦煤矿的党政负责人没有注意这一事件，也没有亲自掌握；他们只把这一重大工作交给林西矿，自己很少过问和检查。林西矿党委会经过研究，决定了派往大同学习的人员，其中机电技术人员就是钟茵。林西矿公安分处认为派一个已判徒刑的反革命犯去学习是不妥当的，他们曾三次向开滦公安处的负责人请示。前两次，开滦公安处也不同意派钟茵去学习；但到第三次时，他们因为林西矿党委已经决定并再三坚持意见，自己也就无原则地同意了。这一错误决定作出以后，林西矿的行政上曾请示开滦煤矿总管理处的一个副主任，这个副主任也没有提出反对意见。林西矿党委和开滦公安处都没有向开滦党委请示报告，开滦党委也不知道这件事。直到康拜因机被破坏的事件发生以后，开滦党委才知道派往大同学习的机电技术人员是钟茵。
    派往大同学习的人回来后，两台苏联康拜因采煤机运到了林西矿。林西矿党委又一错再错地决定，要钟茵来担任康拜因机的技术工作，指导工人学习康拜因机的技术操作。这一错误决定，林西矿党委也未向开滦党委请示报告，开滦党委也根本没有过问或检查。就这样，刚由苏联运来的康拜因机，便落到一个已判徒刑的、对苏联人民和中国人民都怀抱着敌意的反革命分子手里。一九五三年九月七日，这个在高等学校机械科毕业、有四年以上机械工作实际经验、并且在大同专门学习过的“技术人员”钟茵，就在康拜因司机训练班指挥工人拆卸康拜因机截煤部第二段减速装置时，故意违背顿巴斯采煤康拜因说明书所规定的拆卸顺序，故意违背训练班教员贺代文关于依顺序拆卸的详细嘱咐，肆无忌惮地叫工人颠倒顺序来拆卸。在机件拆不下来时，就明目张胆地命令十几个不懂康拜因机械构造和操作技术的工人轮番用八磅重的大锤捶打中心轴。有些工人阻止他，他完全不听，一直捶打了一个半小时之久，直到他认为机器确已损毁为止。这就是反革命犯钟茵给予那些轻敌麻痹、并且沾染了官僚主义恶习的开滦煤矿和林西矿党政负责人的第一个回答。
    但是这一重大破坏事件并没有惊醒林西矿的负责同志们，他们甚至没有提出任何怀疑。他们无条件地信任钟茵，完全肯定地认为这是责任事故，也没有及时地严肃处理（就是责任事故也应该认真处理。——编者）有的负责人甚至在最后事实已经查明、上级已经批准逮捕钟犯以后，还一再坚持自己的错误意见。开滦党委的态度怎样呢？据开滦党委的一个主要负责人说：党委会的几个主要负责人倒是没有林西矿那样完全肯定的看法，但是耽心钟茵离开以后没有人能代替他的工作，因此也没有及时处理。九月二十七日林西公安分处向开滦公安处提出报告，十月三十日，开滦公安处经过调查，正式向开滦党委提出报告，而且下面也有同志要求开滦党委开会讨论这一事件。但是开滦党委的负责同志只是个别商谈了一下，也没有正式开会研究这一事件，对于下面的报告也迟迟没有答复。直到一九五三年十二月初，距离这一破坏事件的发生大约有三个月了，开滦党委的一个主要负责人才对下面的报告提出几个怀疑之点，指示他们要继续查对事实。这时反革命犯钟茵仍然留在原来的重要岗位上，继续寻找破坏的机会。在开滦党委指示的查对工作还没有得到结果以前，在一九五三年十二月十四日，钟犯又在井下指挥工人进行连接康拜因机截煤部和电动部的工作时，利用工人不懂安装技术的弱点，第二次故意采用错误的工作法，破坏了康拜因采煤机。
    从事件发生前后的这些情况中不难看出：开滦煤矿和林西矿领导上的严重轻敌麻痹思想和腐朽的官僚主义，就是反革命分子钟茵能够毫无阻碍地连续破坏康拜因机的主要原因，这是我们应该深切记取的教训。
