    "Current Issues"
    The Chongqing Xinhua Daily has been running a "Current Issues" column since April 18th. This is a form of reporting for criticism and self-criticism in the newspaper. Based on the materials the newspaper has obtained or feedback from readers, it promptly raises criticisms and suggestions regarding various problems existing in current work or in the lives of the masses.
    In the April 23rd edition, this column raised the issue of the low quality of light industrial products produced by some factories in Chongqing. Based on the reflections of staff from state-owned commercial and cooperative departments at a conference, the newspaper criticized, "The wool yarn produced by the Chongqing China Wool Textile Factory is unevenly spun, the wool is hard and irritating to wear, the color is not bright, and the price is more expensive than Shanghai's wool yarn. Rural girls cannot afford it, female factory workers are unwilling to wear it, and state-owned stores have accumulated a lot of capital as a result." "Current Issues" also pointed out: The recycled rubber soles of shoes produced in Chongqing break easily; some electric fans produced by the Chongqing Motor Factory need to be pushed by hand to start.
    For more than three months, the "Current Issues" column has been published more than sixty times. It has conducted relatively broad criticisms targeting problems and shortcomings in real life. Among these, the newspaper also conducted continuous exposure and criticism of issues such as some factories not paying attention to summer cooling work and not paying attention to the combination of technological innovation and production. From the newspaper, it appears that some "Current Issues" have received the attention of those criticized and have specific improvement measures. For example, the June 1st newspaper reported that the Communist Party organization, administration, trade union, and Youth League leaders of the Chongqing Joint State-Private China Wool Textile Factory, based on the newspaper's criticism and the instructions of the Chongqing Municipal Industrial Bureau, conducted research and inspection. It was also decided to conduct a mass quality inspection throughout the factory to improve shortcomings and gradually establish and improve various quality inspection systems.
    The Northeast Daily also launched a "Current Issues" column on June 5th, raising issues such as passengers not being able to get boiling water on trains and primary school teachers not having enough preparation and rest time. Relevant units under the Harbin Railway Administration quickly took concrete measures after seeing the criticism about the water shortage problem on June 5th. In addition to strengthening mobile water sales on trains, the Shenyang Travel Service Station also set up an "unmanned water sales point." According to a reader's letter published in the Northeast Daily on July 10th, the phenomenon of passengers not being able to get boiling water has disappeared.
    The successful examples of the "Current Issues" columns in the Chongqing Xinhua Daily and the Northeast Daily prove that as long as newspapers can stand in the midst of the lives of the masses and use reporting formats sufficient to clarify those events and problems in order to solve the problems raised in the lives of the masses and current work, they can promote the advancement of work and life. From this point of view, the "Current Issues" reporting format is worth learning from. (Yi Ren, Hai Chun)

    “当前问题”
    重庆新华日报从四月十八日起，辟设了“当前问题”一栏。这是报纸进行批评和自我批评的一种报道形式。它根据报纸所掌握的材料或读者的反映，对当前工作或群众生活中所存在的各种问题及时地提出批评和建议。
    四月二十三日的这一栏，提出了重庆某些工厂生产的轻工业产品质量低劣的问题。报纸根据国营商业和合作社部门工作人员在一次会议上的反映，提出批评说，“重庆中国毛纺织厂的毛线，纺得松紧不匀，毛质又硬，穿在身上刺人，颜色又不鲜艳，价钱还比上海的毛线贵，农村姑娘买不起，工厂女工不愿穿，国营商店也因而积压了不少资金。”“当前问题”也指出：重庆出的再生胶底皮鞋的胶底容易断；重庆电机厂出产的电扇，有的要用手推一下才动一下。
    三个多月来，“当前问题”栏刊出在六十次以上。它针对现实生活中的问题和缺点，进行了比较广泛的批评。这当中，报纸还对某些工厂不重视暑期降温工作、不注意技术革新与生产的结合等问题，进行了连续性的揭露和批评。从报纸上看来，有的“当前问题”已经受到被批评者的重视，并且有了具体的改进措施。例如，六月一日的报纸报道说：重庆公私合营中国毛纺织厂的共产党组织、行政、工会、青年团的负责人，根据报纸的批评和重庆市工业局的指示，进行了研究和检查。并决定在全厂范围内进行一次群众性的品质大检查，改进缺点，逐步建立和健全品质检验的各种制度。
    东北日报也自六月五日起辟设了“当前的问题”一栏，先后提出了旅客在火车上喝不到开水、小学教师没有足够的备课和休息时间等问题。哈尔滨铁路管理局所属有关单位，见到六月五日关于缺水问题的批评后，很快就采取了具体措施。沈阳旅行服务站除在列车上加强流动卖水的工作外，还设立了“无人售水处”。据七月十日东北日报发表的读者来信说，旅客喝不到开水的现象已经没有了。
    重庆新华日报和东北日报“当前问题”栏收到效果的例子已可证明：报纸只要能够站在群众的生活当中，并且为了解决群众生活和当前工作中所提出来的问题，运用足以阐明那些事件和问题的报道形式，它就能够推动工作和生活前进。从这一点上来说，“当前问题”这一报道形式，是值得学习的。　（毅人、海椿）
