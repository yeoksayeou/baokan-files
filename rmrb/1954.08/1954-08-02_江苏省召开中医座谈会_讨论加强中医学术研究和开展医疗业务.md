The United Front Work Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Health Department jointly invited 59 people from the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and some from Western medicine in Jiangsu Province from July 10th to 15th to hold the first provincial symposium on TCM. The symposium fully promoted democratic spirit and solicited opinions on strengthening TCM work.

At the symposium, Comrade Sheng Li of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Health Department made a report on "The Situation of TCM Work in Jiangsu Province in the Past Four Years and Opinions on Future Work," summarizing the achievements of past work, criticizing the shortcomings and errors in past work, and putting forward preliminary opinions on future work.

The TCM and Western medicine practitioners attending the meeting broadly exchanged views on further strengthening TCM work. The TCM practitioners attending the meeting pointed out in their speeches that the Communist Party and the People's Government care about the people's health and attach importance to TCM work, which has further encouraged the confidence and enthusiasm of TCM practitioners. Everyone also unanimously stated that in order to promote the academic research of TCM and develop the medical practice of TCM, it is necessary to study modern scientific knowledge and advanced Soviet medicine, pay attention to summarizing and exchanging the practical experience of TCM, and develop Chinese medicine. Some people also suggested in their speeches that in order to strengthen the unity between TCM and Western medicine, we should establish the noble goal of serving the people's health together, break down sectarian prejudices, learn from each other, and learn from each other's strengths. At the symposium, valuable experiences of TCM were initially exchanged. Many TCM practitioners announced their ancestral medical experiences and various effective prescriptions.

The symposium put forward suggestions on improving the work of the Health Workers Association, on improving the work of TCM joint clinics, on strengthening the leadership of individual TCM practitioners, on improving the supply of Chinese herbal medicines, on improving TCM advanced studies, strengthening TCM academic research, strengthening TCM political and professional studies, on the establishment of a Provincial TCM College and a Provincial TCM Experimental Hospital, and on convening a provincial TCM representative conference. A preparatory committee for the Jiangsu Provincial TCM Academic Research Association was also established at the meeting.

Finally, Comrade Yu Minghuang, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and member of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Cultural and Educational Committee, made a concluding speech. In his speech, he repeatedly criticized the erroneous tendency of belittling and discriminating against TCM. He asked TCM practitioners throughout the province to further strengthen TCM academic research and actively carry out TCM medical practice, urged TCM and Western medicine practitioners throughout the province to strengthen unity and learn from each other, and required cadres at all levels throughout the province to value China's cultural heritage, strengthen TCM work, and always pay attention to guiding and helping TCM in academic research and medical practice.

Ke Qingshi and Leng Yu, Vice Chairmen of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government, held a reception after the symposium. At the reception, they encouraged the TCM and Western medicine practitioners attending the meeting to work together to promote China's cultural heritage and protect the people's health. The TCM practitioners attending the meeting said one after another that after returning, they would convey the care and instructions of the Party and the People's Government to the TCM community throughout the province.
