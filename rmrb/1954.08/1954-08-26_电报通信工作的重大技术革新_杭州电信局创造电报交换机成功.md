    Major Technological Innovation in Telegraph Communication Work
    Hangzhou Telecommunications Bureau Successfully Creates Telegraph Exchange
    The telegraph exchange collectively created by all employees of the telegraph room of the Hangzhou Telecommunications Bureau has recently undergone technical appraisal by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government. It has been confirmed as a major technological innovation in telegraph communication work and has been promoted and used in telecommunications bureaus in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Nanjing, where it has been further developed.
    In the past, telecommunications bureaus used one circuit, one set of machines, and one shift of personnel to send and receive telegrams; when there were no telegrams, people and machines were idle, resulting in a great waste of labor and equipment. The telegraph exchange collectively created by the employees of the telegraph room of the Hangzhou Telecommunications Bureau broke through the constraints of this outdated working method, concentrating the business scattered on various circuits to a few people and a few machines, overcoming the unevenness of workload in the past, and significantly improving labor productivity and equipment utilization. It also replaced manual machines with automatic machines for sending and receiving. According to measurements: In the past, the time when staff were without telegrams for more than five minutes accounted for 20% of the total production time, while now it only accounts for 2%. In the past, each staff member could only send 580 characters per hour, but now they can send 1,365 characters. The average time for a telegram has been shortened from 20.6 minutes to 14.8 minutes. After using the telegraph exchange, the number of staff in the telegraph room of the Hangzhou Telecommunications Bureau has been reduced by three-quarters, saving the country more than 180 million yuan annually. After the utilization rate of machinery and equipment increased, it also saved 20% of automatic sending and receiving machines, 80% of perforating machines, 60% of typewriters, and all manual machines.
    After using the telegraph exchange, it can also ensure accurate and rapid transmission and reception of telegrams. In the past, because the sending and receiving machines and circuits were scattered, when encountering telegrams with the same content, they had to be sent one by one; however many places it needed to be sent to, that many times it had to be sent. Now, with the telegraph exchange, only one sending machine is needed, and one person can send all telegrams with the same content in one go. The use of telegraph exchanges has also simplified the procedures for retransmission. For example, a telegram from Quzhou to Shanghai no longer needs to be retransmitted via the Hangzhou Telecommunications Bureau. In the past, retransmission required processing through four procedures, but now the telegraph exchange can connect the two circuits and allow both parties to communicate directly.

    电报通信工作的重大技术革新
    杭州电信局创造电报交换机成功
    杭州电信局报房全体职工集体创造的电报交换机，最近经中央人民政府邮电部进行技术鉴定，确认它是电报通信工作的重大技术革新，并已先后在北京、上海、沈阳、天津、南京等大城市的电信局推广使用中，得到进一步的发展。
    过去电信局都是利用一条电路、一套机器、一班人手来拍发电报；在没有电报的时候，人和机器都闲着，劳动力和机器设备有很大的浪费。杭州电信局报房职工集体创造的电报交换机，突破了这种陈旧的工作方法的束缚，把分散于各条电路上的业务集中到几个人和几部机器上，克服了过去忙闲不匀的现象，显著地提高了劳动生产率和设备利用率。并将人工机改用自动机收发。根据测定：过去工作人员五分钟以上的无报时间要占到总生产时间的百分之二十，而现在只占百分之二。过去每个工作人员每小时只能拍发五百八十个字，现在能拍发一千三百六十五个字。电报平均需时从二十点六分缩短到十四点八分钟。使用电报交换机后，杭州电信局报房的工作人员比前减少了四分之三，每年可为国家节省一亿八千多万元。机器设备利用率提高后，并节省了百分之二十的自动收发报机、百分之八十的凿孔机、百分之六十的打字机及全部人工机。
    使用电报交换机后，还能做到收发电报准确、迅速。过去因为收发报的机器和电路分散，遇到同文电报就要一个一个地拍发，发多少地方，就要拍多少次。现在使用电报交换机，只要用一部发报机，由一个人一次拍发，就能把同文电报全部发出；使用电报交换机后，也简化了转报的手续，如从衢州发到上海的电报，再不要由杭州电信局经转。过去转报要经过四道工序的处理，现在使用电报交换机就能把两条电路接通，使双方直接通报。
