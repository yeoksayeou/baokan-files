    The Chinese People Will Never Allow...
    Fu Rong
    A conspiracy to launch a new provocation against the 600 million Chinese people is being hastily concocted in Washington. Apparently, the U.S. ruling clique, unnerved by the Geneva Conference's agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, is pinning its hopes for undermining the restoration of peace in Asia and obstructing the easing of the international situation on provocative activities against the great People's Republic of China.
    On August 3, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a publicly provocative speech, bringing the provocative activities of the U.S. ruling clique in recent times to a climax. Dulles shamelessly stated that the U.S. government has the so-called responsibility to "defend" Taiwan, and its navy and air force will prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. Dulles also bluntly stated that the U.S. government is negotiating with the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang to establish a "formal common defense alliance," and is also planning to form a "single alliance" with Japan, South Korea, and the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang.
    It is beneficial to listen to Dulles' remarks. The U.S. ruling clique's policy of choosing to be enemies with the 600 million Chinese people for a long time has been fully confirmed by Dulles.
    Dulles said they want to "defend" Taiwan. Is Taiwan American territory? Dulles dared not mention that Taiwan is Chinese territory, yet arrogantly proclaimed to "defend Taiwan." This is tantamount to admitting that the U.S. ruling clique wants to occupy our territory Taiwan for a long time, to turn our territory Taiwan into an American colony and a military base for attacking our country forever, to continue to support the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique entrenched in Taiwan to wage a war against the Chinese people to sabotage the unification of the motherland, and to use this heinous war to carry out armed intervention, create new tensions, and disrupt peace in the Asian region.
    People know that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory. Long before Columbus discovered the American continent, Chinese ancestors had established their homes in Taiwan. The American occupation of our territory Taiwan is completely illegal. This act not only openly violates the United Nations Charter, but also perfidiously violates the international obligations stipulated in the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation" that it itself once promised. Its occupation of our territory Taiwan, turning Taiwan into its colony and military base, is a crime of intolerable and serious infringement upon the territorial sovereignty of the People's Republic of China.
    The U.S. ruling clique cannot deny that it has committed this crime of aggression with any excuse. As early as shortly after Japan's surrender, the U.S. ruling clique began its activities to occupy Taiwan. At that time, the United States replaced Japan and, through the traitorous government of the Kuomintang reactionaries, controlled Taiwan militarily, politically, and economically, turning Taiwan into an American colony and military base. In 1949, the Chinese people won the great victory of liberating mainland China, and Chiang Kai-shek and his traitorous clique fled to Taiwan under the protection of the United States, attempting to use Taiwan as their last struggling nest. From that time on, the U.S. ruling clique stepped up its military, political, and economic control of Taiwan, actively supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique entrenched in Taiwan to eke out a precarious existence. In June 1950, the U.S. ruling clique launched the war of aggression against Korea, and at the same time announced that it would use force to prevent our country from liberating Taiwan, occupying our territory Taiwan by means of open and direct armed occupation. From this time on, the U.S. ruling clique has intensified its activities to invade China, based on Taiwan.
    The Chinese people, tempered by long struggles, see very clearly that the American occupation of our territory Taiwan is not accidental. It is part of the U.S. ruling clique's entire plan to invade China, interfere in China's internal affairs, and subvert the Chinese people's regime. The U.S. ruling clique's consistent protection and support of the public enemy of the Chinese people—Chiang Kai-shek and his traitorous clique—proves this point. As early as during the Chinese People's Liberation War, the U.S. ruling clique openly stood on the side of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, using all its strength to support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in attacking the Chinese people. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the U.S. ruling clique, unwilling to accept its failure in China, has even more unscrupulously adopted a hostile attitude of war threats and armed intervention toward the 600 million Chinese people, implementing a criminal policy aimed at subverting the People's Republic of China. The U.S. ruling clique's protection of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to flee to Taiwan, supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to entrench in Taiwan, and directing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out traitorous activities to sabotage the unification of the motherland, aims to use the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique as a tool to attack mainland China, conspiring to support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's restoration in China, vainly attempting to turn China into an American colony again and thereby re-enslave and oppress the Chinese people. This is the policy that the U.S. ruling clique has consistently adopted towards the People's Republic of China.
    It must be pointed out that the U.S. ruling clique is intensifying its collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique precisely when the U.S.'s policy of aggression against the People's Republic of China is suffering a series of setbacks. The U.S. ruling clique launched the war of aggression against Korea, which included its aim to encircle China militarily, invade China, and subvert China. After three years of heroic resistance, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers won a great victory in defeating the American aggressors, driving the American aggressor army back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel where it launched the war, forcing it to accept and sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. Unwilling to accept its failure in Korea, the U.S. ruling clique strengthened its activities to interfere in the Indochina war after the Korean armistice. Its interference in the Indochina war also included its aim to encircle China militarily, invade China, and subvert China. At the Geneva Conference, the U.S. ruling clique played all sorts of conspiracies in an attempt to obstruct and sabotage the agreement reached at the Geneva Conference. Only because of the sincere consultation between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France, and the active assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and Britain, did the Geneva Conference finally break through the U.S.'s obstruction and sabotage and reach an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina. The achievements of the Geneva Conference were a major blow to the U.S. ruling clique's policy of aggression. The Geneva Conference encouraged all peace-loving people with the prospect of guaranteeing peace in Asia. The trend of easing international tensions began, the call for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems grew louder, and the influence and prestige of the People's Republic of China as a major power in international affairs were universally recognized. People see that it is precisely at this time that the U.S. ruling clique has intensified its activities to launch mad provocations against the People's Republic of China.
    Facts prove that it is precisely today, when the cessation of the Korean War and the restoration of peace in Indochina have been successively realized, that the U.S. ruling clique is pinning its hopes for invading China, creating new tensions, and preventing the restoration of peace in Asia on the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique entrenched in Taiwan, and on a "military group" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique participating, aimed at threatening China with war and expanding armed intervention. It is precisely for this purpose that the U.S. ruling clique is stepping up its "aid" to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, while strengthening the U.S. military forces occupying Taiwan, so that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can continue and expand its war against the Chinese people under the military protection of the United States. It is also for this purpose that the U.S. ruling clique is planning to conclude a so-called "bilateral common security treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to use such a military treaty to strengthen the front on Taiwan from which the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique launches attacks against the Chinese people, and to make Taiwan forever an American colony and a military base for attacking China. It is also for this purpose that the U.S. ruling clique is actively piecing together Asian military blocs. It is planning to organize Japan, South Korea, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique into a so-called "Northeast Asia Defense Alliance," and is also trying its best to impose an aggressive military bloc on some Southeast Asian countries. According to the U.S. plan, these military blocs will all organize an aggressive army commanded by the United States and using Asians as cannon fodder, in order to realize Eisenhower's strategy of "Asians fighting Asians." Needless to say, the People's Republic of China is the primary target of this strategy. All this cannot be hidden from the vigilant eyes of the Chinese people.
    The U.S. ruling clique's particular hatred of the Chinese people is well known. The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution overthrew the rule of the American imperialists and their running dogs in China, thereby inspiring the struggle of the oppressed peoples of Asian countries to win their national independence. The Chinese people have proven with their great victory that imperialism can be defeated; without the oppression of imperialism, Asian people can not only live, but can live better. Obviously, the U.S. ruling clique is by no means willing to accept its failure in China, let alone the disillusionment of its dream of dominating Asia, and therefore regards the Chinese people who have stood up as the most serious obstacle on its path to conquering China and dominating Asia.
    The Chinese people's current wishes are understandable to all peace-loving people. The Chinese people want to build their great motherland, to build their motherland into a great socialist country. While building their great motherland, the Chinese people will naturally never forget to liberate Taiwan from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the public enemy of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people must eliminate this public enemy. The Chinese people fully understand that only by liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can they achieve the complete unification of their motherland; only by liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can they achieve the complete victory of the cause of people's liberation; only by liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can they further guarantee peace in Asia and the world, and the attainment of guaranteed peace in Asia and the world is fully in line with the interests of the Chinese people's great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.
    Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the Chinese people's own business, it is our country's internal affair, it is the sacred right of our people to exercise sovereignty over their own territory. We will naturally never allow others to interfere in our country's internal affairs, in our country's territorial sovereignty and national rights, and in our people's own affairs. As Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said in his diplomatic report: "China has no intention of invading the territory of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries invading China's territory. China has no intention of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries infringing upon China's sovereignty. China has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries interfering in China's internal affairs. China will never threaten the security of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries threatening China's security." Our people's peaceful intentions are not allowed to be distorted. We have always advocated that the affairs of the world should be managed by the people of each country themselves, and the affairs of Asian countries should be managed by the people of Asian countries themselves, and should not be managed by the United States. Our people are willing to establish and develop peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. It would be a big mistake to understand our people's peaceful intentions as meaning that we are weak and can be bullied, and therefore to vainly attempt to bully us, interfere in our internal affairs, prevent our people from liberating Taiwan, and infringe upon our country's sacred right to exercise sovereignty over Taiwan.
    One should understand the Chinese people from the lessons of history. The Chinese people are not lambs; they are willing to accept any most arrogant provocation. The Chinese people love peace, but have never been and will never be afraid of resisting imperialist aggression. The Chinese people have endured many hardships, and they have experienced the tempering of a long struggle against imperialist oppression. The Chinese people cannot be touched. They have become stronger day by day in the struggle against American imperialist aggression. No matter how determined the U.S. ruling clique is to be enemies with the 600 million Chinese people, whether it occupies Taiwan for a long time, supports the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, or organizes a military bloc with aggression against China as its primary goal, it cannot prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The U.S. ruling clique must bear all the consequences of its occupation of our territory Taiwan, interference in our internal affairs, and prevention of our liberation of Taiwan. They must know that the Chinese people who have stood up know how to defend their sacred national rights and national dignity from any infringement.
    To Dulles' provocation, the answer of our 600 million Chinese people is only one sentence: We will never allow it!

    中国人民决不容许…………
    傅容
    一个对六亿中国人民进行新的挑衅的阴谋正在华盛顿赶紧制造中。显然，被日内瓦会议达成关于恢复印度支那和平的协议弄得心慌意乱的美国统治集团，正在把它们破坏亚洲和平的恢复和阻挠国际局势的缓和的希望，寄托在对伟大的中华人民共和国的挑衅活动上。
    八月三日，美国国务卿杜勒斯发表了公开挑衅的谈话，使最近时期美国统治集团的挑衅活动达到了顶点。杜勒斯毫不知羞耻地说，美国政府负有所谓“保卫”台湾的责任，它的海军和空军要阻止中国人民解放台湾和澎湖列岛。杜勒斯还直言不讳地说，美国政府正在和蒋介石残余匪帮谈判建立“正式的共同防御联盟”，并且还在策划成立一个有日本、南朝鲜和蒋介石残余匪帮参加的“单一的联盟”。
    听听杜勒斯的这番谈话倒是很有益处的。美国统治集团不惜采取长期与六亿中国人民为敌的政策从杜勒斯的口中得到了完全的证实。
    杜勒斯说它们要“保卫”台湾，难道台湾是美国的领土么？杜勒斯不敢提到台湾是中国的领土，而又狂妄地宣称什么“保卫台湾”，这就不啻招认美国统治集团要长期侵占我国领土台湾，要把我国领土台湾永远变成美国的殖民地和进攻我国的军事基地，要继续支持盘据台湾的蒋介石卖国集团对中国人民进行破坏祖国统一的战争，要利用这一罪恶战争来进行武装干涉，制造新的紧张局势和破坏亚洲地区的和平。
    人们知道，台湾是中国神圣领土的不可分割的部分。远在哥伦布发现美洲大陆以前，中国的先民就在台湾建立起自己的家园。美国侵占我国领土台湾是完全非法的。它的这种行为，不但公然违背了联合国宪章，而且背信弃义地破坏了它自己所曾经承诺的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”规定了的国际约束。它的侵占我国领土台湾，把台湾变成它的殖民地和军事基地，是对于中华人民共和国的领土主权的不可容忍的严重侵犯的罪行。
    美国统治集团用任何借口都不能抵赖它犯下了这个侵略罪行。早在日本投降后不久，美国统治集团就开始了侵占台湾的活动。还在那个时候，美国就代替了日本的地位，经过国民党反动派卖国政府，在军事上、政治上和经济上控制了台湾，把台湾变成了美国的殖民地和军事基地。一九四九年，中国人民取得解放中国大陆的伟大胜利，蒋介石及其卖国集团在美国的庇护下逃往台湾，企图把台湾当作它们最后挣扎的巢穴。从那时候起，美国统治集团就加紧从军事上、政治上和经济上控制台湾，积极支持盘据台湾的蒋介石卖国集团苟延残喘。一九五○年六月，美国统治集团发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，同时就宣布以武力阻止我国解放台湾，以公开的直接的武装占领的方式侵占了我国领土台湾。从这个时候起，美国统治集团就以台湾为根据地加紧进行它侵略中国的活动。
    久经斗争锻炼的中国人民看得很清楚：美国的侵占我国领土台湾不是偶然的，它是美国统治集团侵略中国、干涉中国内政、颠覆中国人民政权的整个计划的一部分。美国统治集团始终庇护和支持中国人民的公敌——蒋介石及其卖国集团就证明了这一点。早在中国人民解放战争期间，美国统治集团就公开站在蒋介石卖国集团方面，用一切力量支持蒋介石卖国集团进攻中国人民。中华人民共和国成立后，美国统治集团由于不甘心它在中国的失败，更不惜对六亿中国人民公开采取战争威胁和武装干涉的敌对态度，实行旨在颠覆中华人民共和国的罪恶政策。美国统治集团庇护蒋介石卖国集团逃往台湾，支持蒋介石卖国集团盘据台湾，指使蒋介石卖国集团进行破坏祖国的统一的卖国活动，其目的就在于把蒋介石卖国集团当作进攻中国大陆的工具，阴谋支持蒋介石卖国集团在中国复辟，妄想重新把中国变成美国的殖民地并从而重新奴役和压迫中国人民。这就是美国统治集团对中华人民共和国一贯采取的政策。
    必须指出这种情况：美国统治集团加紧它和蒋介石卖国集团的勾结正是在美国对中华人民共和国的侵略政策遭到一连串的挫败的时候。美国统治集团发动侵略朝鲜的战争，包含着它从军事上包围中国、侵略中国、颠覆中国的目的。经过了三年的英勇抵抗，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军取得了战败美国侵略者的伟大胜利，把美国侵略军打回了它发动战争的三八线附近，迫使它不得不接受和签订朝鲜停战协定。不甘心在朝鲜失败的美国统治集团在朝鲜停战后加强了它干涉印度支那战争的活动。它的干涉印度支那战争，也包含着它的从军事上包围中国、侵略中国、颠覆中国的目的。在日内瓦会议上，美国统治集团玩弄了一切阴谋诡计，企图阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议达成协议。只是由于越南民主共和国和法国的诚意协商，苏联、中国和英国的积极协助，日内瓦会议才终于打破了美国的阻挠和破坏而达成了恢复印度支那和平的协议。日内瓦会议的成就对于美国统治集团的侵略政策是一个重大的打击。日内瓦会议以保证亚洲和平的前景鼓舞了所有爱好和平的人民。国际紧张局势开始了缓和的趋势，社会制度不同的国家应该和平共处的呼声有了更大的增长，中华人民共和国作为一个大国在国际事务中的影响和威信也得到了普遍的承认。人们看见，正是在这样的时候，美国统治集团加强了它向中华人民共和国进行疯狂挑衅的活动。
    事实证明，正是在朝鲜战争的停止和印度支那和平的恢复相继实现的今天，美国统治集团更把它侵略中国、制造新的紧张局势和阻止亚洲和平恢复的希望寄托在盘据台湾的蒋介石卖国集团的身上，寄托在有蒋介石卖国集团参加的旨在对中国实行战争威胁和扩大武装干涉的“军事集团”身上，正是为了这个目的，美国统治集团正在加紧“援助”蒋介石卖国集团，同时加强美国侵占台湾的军事力量，以便蒋介石卖国集团能够在美国的军事庇护之下继续和扩大它进攻中国人民的战争。也正是为了这个目的，美国统治集团正在策划同蒋介石卖国集团订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”，企图用这样的军事条约来加强台湾这个蒋介石卖国集团据以进攻中国人民的战线，并使台湾永远成为美国的殖民地和进攻中国的军事基地。也正是为了这个目的，美国统治集团正在积极拼凑亚洲军事集团。它正在策划把日本、南朝鲜和蒋介石卖国集团组织成为所谓“东北亚防御联盟”，也正在千方百计要把一个侵略性的军事集团强加在东南亚某些国家身上。按照美国的计划，这些军事集团都要组织一支由美国指挥的以亚洲人为炮灰的侵略军队，以实现艾森豪威尔的“亚洲人打亚洲人”的战略，不消说，中华人民共和国是这一战略的首当其冲的目标。这一切都瞒不过中国人民的警觉的眼睛。
    美国统治集团特别仇视中国人民是人所共知的。中国人民革命的伟大胜利，推翻了美帝国主义者及其走狗在中国的统治，从而鼓舞了亚洲各国被压迫人民争取自己民族独立的斗争。中国人民以自己伟大的胜利证明了：帝国主义是可以被战胜的；没有帝国主义的压迫，亚洲人民不但可以生活，而且可以生活得更好。显然，美国统治集团绝不甘心它在中国的失败，更不甘心它的独霸亚洲的迷梦的幻灭，因而就把站起来了的中国人民视为它征服中国、独霸亚洲的道路上的最严重的障碍物。
    中国人民现在的愿望是一切爱好和平的人们都能够理解的。中国人民要建设自己的伟大祖国，要把自己的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。中国人民在建设自己伟大祖国的同时，自然一刻也不会忘记要把台湾从蒋介石卖国集团的统治下解放出来。台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。蒋介石卖国集团是中国人民的公敌，中国人民一定要消灭这个公敌。中国人民完全了解：只有解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，才能够实现自己祖国的完全的统一；只有解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，才能够取得人民解放事业的完全的胜利；只有解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团，才能够进一步保障亚洲和世界的和平，而亚洲和世界和平的获得保障，是完全符合中国人民的社会主义建设和社会主义改造这一伟大事业的利益的。
    解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，这是中国人民自己的事情，这是我们国家的内政，这是我国人民对自己的领土行使主权的神圣权利。对于我国的内政，对于我国的领土主权和民族权利，对于我国人民自己的事情，我们自然绝不容许别人来干涉。正如周恩来外交部长在他的外交报告中所说：“中国没有侵略别国领土的意图，也决不容忍别国侵略中国的领土。中国没有侵犯别国主权的意图，也决不容忍别国侵犯中国的主权。中国没有干涉别国内政的意图，也决不容忍别国干涉中国的内政。中国决不威胁别国的安全，也决不容忍别国威胁中国的安全。”我国人民的这种和平意愿是不容被歪曲的。我们一向主张世界各国的事务由各国人民自己来管，亚洲各国的事务由亚洲各国人民来管，而不应由美国来管。我国人民愿意在互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的原则基础上同一切国家建立和发展和平合作关系。把我国人民这种和平意愿了解为我们软弱可欺，因而妄想欺侮我们，干涉我国内政，阻止我国人民解放台湾，侵犯我国对台湾行使主权的神圣权利，那就大错而特错了。
    应当从历史的教训来了解中国人民。中国人民不是羔羊，她是敢于接受任何最狂妄的挑衅的。中国人民爱好和平，但是从不也永不害怕抵抗帝国主义的侵略。中国人民饱经忧患，它经历了反对帝国主义压迫的长期斗争的锻炼。中国人民是碰不得的，她在反对美帝国主义的侵略斗争中已一天比一天更加强大起来。不管美国统治集团怎样决心与六亿中国人民为敌，长期侵占台湾也罢，支持蒋介石卖国集团也罢，组织以侵略中国为首要目标的军事集团也罢，都阻止不了中国人民从蒋介石卖国集团的统治下把台湾解放出来。美国统治集团必须承担它侵占我国领土台湾、干涉我国内政、阻止我国解放台湾的一切后果。他们必须知道：站起来了的中国人民是知道怎样保卫自己的神圣的民族权利和民族尊严不受任何侵犯的。
    对于杜勒斯的挑衅，我们六亿中国人民的回答，只有一句话：我们决不容许！
