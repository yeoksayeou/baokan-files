Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 7th. From August 3rd to 4th, the area between Tongguan and Meng County in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, as well as parts of the Yi River, Luo River, and Qin River, experienced sudden heavy rainfall, causing a sharp rise in the Yellow River's water level. By 2:00 AM on August 5th, the water level at Qinchang, Henan (upstream of the Yellow River Iron Bridge), had risen to 97.61 meters, only 0.54 meters away from the guaranteed water level of 98.15 meters. The peak flood flow was approximately 15,000 cubic meters per second, creating the largest flood since 1942.

The Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters and the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters of Henan and Shandong provinces convened emergency meetings on the 4th, respectively, to study the characteristics of the rainfall and water situation and made specific arrangements for flood control in various areas along the river. Zhao Mingfu, Deputy Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Zhang Fang, Deputy Director of the Henan Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters, and Liu Xiqian, Deputy Director of the Henan Provincial Yellow River Affairs Bureau, and other responsible comrades have also gone to various dangerous sections of the Yellow River to personally guide flood control. Leading comrades at all levels along the river have also largely gone to the dikes. The Deputy Secretary of the Puyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Deputy Secretary of the Zhengzhou Prefectural Committee, the Commissioner of the Xinxiang Special Office, and the county heads of the counties along the river have also led a large number of cadres to the dikes to lead the masses in flood control. On the 5th, the peak flood was slowly advancing eastward within Henan Province. The powerful flood control force of 320,000 people, which has been formed in Henan and Shandong, is also prepared for flood control. Long-term flood control personnel and engineering teams in various river sections are distributed on the long dikes to check the water and protect the dikes, patrol day and night, and conduct strict defense.

    黄河中游水位陡涨
    强大队伍上堤防汛
   【新华社开封七日电】黄河中游潼关到孟县间和伊河、洛河和沁河等部分地区，在八月三日到四日突降暴雨，黄河水位陡涨。到八月五日晨二时，河南秦厂（黄河铁桥上边）水位就升达九七点六一公尺，距离保证水位九八点一五公尺只有零点五四公尺了。最高洪峰约有一万五千秒公方，造成了一九四二年以来的最大一次洪水。
    黄河防汛总指挥部和河南、山东两省黄河防汛指挥部，在四日即已分别召开了紧急会议，研究了此次雨情水情的特点，对沿岸各地防洪作了具体布置。黄河水利委员会副主任赵明甫、河南黄河防汛指挥部副主任张方、河南省黄河河务局副局长刘希骞等负责同志也已分赴黄河各险工地段，亲自指导防洪。沿河两岸的各级负责同志也已大部上堤。中共濮阳地委副书记、郑州地委副书记、新乡专署专员和沿河各县县长，也都率领大批干部上堤，领导群众防洪。五日，最高洪峰正在河南境内缓缓向东推进。河南和山东已组成的三十二万人的强大防汛队伍，也都作好了防洪准备。各个河段的长期防汛员、工程队正分布在漫长的大堤上进行查水护堤，昼夜巡逻，严密进行防守。
