The Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Union continues to develop its retail network in newly built areas. From late July to mid-August, it has established 23 new retail outlets, including four regional stores, five distribution points in factories, schools, construction sites, six regional sales sheds, one pancake stand, and one specialty vegetable stall. In the new urban area of Yongding Road, it has also set up a canteen, barbershop, laundry, sewing department, photo studio, and repair shop (for clocks, shoes, and bicycles). The Chaoyangmenwai Street Department Store of the East Suburban Supply and Marketing Cooperative has nearly two thousand kinds of goods, including general merchandise, clothing fabrics, shoes, sweets, porcelain, and local produce. The Chaoyangmenwai Street Non-staple Food Store, Xinmin Village, and Xidian stores also have a complete range of goods. In addition to supplying daily necessities, the sales sheds also have snack sections that provide pancakes, fried dough sticks, rice wine, and side dishes, as well as kiosks selling cigarettes, food, and sweets. To remedy the inadequacy of the retail network, fourteen mobile tricycle vending carts have been added in the eastern suburbs and new urban areas. At the same time, five existing regional stores and agency distribution points have been expanded.
