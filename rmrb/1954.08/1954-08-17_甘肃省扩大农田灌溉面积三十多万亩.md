Gansu Province Expands Irrigated Farmland by More Than 300,000 Mu

From January to late July of this year, Gansu Province expanded its irrigated farmland by a total of 320,000 mu, completing 80 percent of the annual plan.

This year, the vast majority of areas in the province learned from the drought disaster of 1953 and strengthened leadership over water conservancy work. After receiving education on the general line and participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for building water conservancy projects and developing production has also significantly increased. The Gansu Provincial People's Government issued nearly 10 billion yuan in water conservancy loans and dispatched more than 170 technical cadres to various places to help farmers solve technical difficulties. As a result, the construction and renovation of small-scale water conservancy projects in various places this year have not only been vigorously carried out, but the quality has also been improved compared to the past. As of early July, there were a total of 551 newly built and renovated main canals in the province, and 25 flood control projects were built. The Wuwei Special District dug more than 22,000 new and old springs this spring and installed 673 waterwheels. The key water conservancy projects under construction and renovation, numbering 47, have mostly been completed and have begun irrigating autumn crops. The Jiuquan Special District made full use of spring water to soak the wasteland and irrigate and store water in reservoirs, using low-lying areas to build water storage ponds, greatly increasing the amount of water storage so that various summer fields downstream of the canals could be irrigated in a timely manner. The Tianshui Special District put forward the slogan of "water going up the mountain," mobilizing farmers to build dams on mountain land to accumulate water. Many areas in the Hexi Corridor have improved irrigation management agencies and grassroots water conservancy organizations, implemented economic water use methods, and improved irrigation methods. In addition to ensuring water use for existing irrigated land, they have also appropriately increased the irrigated area. For example, Shandan County advanced spring irrigation by three to five days this year, increasing irrigation benefits by more than 30,000 mu; Gaotai County shortened one round of irrigation by five to six days; and Jiuquan County converted 80 percent of the large plots into small plots, improving irrigation efficiency.

    甘肃省扩大农田灌溉面积三十多万亩
    甘肃省各地自今年一月至七月下旬，共扩大农田灌溉面积三十二万亩，完成全年计划百分之八十。
    今年，全省绝大多数地区吸取了一九五三年的旱灾教训，加强对水利工作的领导；广大农民在接受总路线教育，参加互助合作组织后，兴修水利发展生产的积极性也显著提高；甘肃省人民政府发放近百亿元的水利贷款，并派了一百七十多名技术干部，到各地帮助农民解决了技术上的困难，因而，今年各地小型水利的兴修、整修工程，不仅能大力开展，而且质量也较以往有所提高。到七月上旬，全省新兴、整修的主要渠道，共有五百五十一条，修筑防洪工程二十五处。武威专区今春挖新旧泉二万二千多眼，安装水车六百七十三部；重点兴修和整修的水利工程有四十七处大部已完工，并开始灌溉秋季作物。酒泉专区充分利用春水泡槎地、灌蓄水库，用洼地修蓄水池，大大增加了蓄水量，使各渠道下游各种夏田，及时得到灌溉。天水专区提出“水地上山”口号，发动农民在山地筑坝积水。河西走廊许多地区，健全了灌溉管理机构和水利基层组织，实行了经济用水办法，改进了灌溉方法，除保证原有的水地用水外，并适当增加了灌溉面积。如山丹县今年春灌提前三天到五天，增加了灌溉效益三万多亩；高台县一轮水缩短了五、六天；酒泉县将百分之八十的大块地改为小畦，提高了灌溉效率。
