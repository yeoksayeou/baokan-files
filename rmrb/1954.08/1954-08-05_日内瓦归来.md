    Returning from Geneva
    By our reporter Wu Wentao

    I. Goodbye, Geneva!

    On July 23rd, we left Geneva in the radiant morning sun, flying to Berlin, the first stop on our way back home.

    From late spring to midsummer, the scenery of Geneva’s lakes and mountains was no different from previous years, but in these nearly three months, people from all corners of the world have been talking about Geneva, hoping that the Foreign Ministers' Conference held in Geneva would achieve positive results. People in Geneva were saying that although Geneva had been the seat of the League of Nations from 1918 to 1946, their city had never been so closely watched by the world as it was this year.

    Before I went to Geneva, what I knew about Geneva, besides it being the seat of the "League of Nations," was limited to its being a center of the famous Swiss watchmaking industry, its natural scenery praised by poets such as Goethe and Byron, and that it was a place that had not experienced war for over a hundred years....

    When I arrived in Geneva in early April, the city nestled against the mountains and lakes was still filled with wind and snow from time to time, and the plane trees by Lake Geneva had not yet sprouted, but Geneva's garden villas and lakeside hotels still attracted countless tourists. Because the flames of the two world wars had not extended to Switzerland, some bourgeois people and newspapers felt that whether there was war or peace, as long as Switzerland maintained its detached "neutrality" and had business to do, that would be enough.

    However, when I personally went to Switzerland, I found that the people were not so "detached." In the spring, when American imperialism used hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific to intimidate, the Geneva cantonal parliament unanimously passed a resolution banning the use of atomic weapons under the opposition of the people. Opening Geneva's newspapers, not only were there more and more articles opposing the United States' obstruction of East-West trade; more prominently, when American monopoly capital attempted to devour the Swiss watch market in the United States by doubling the import tax on Swiss watches, you could see voices from all walks of life calling for taxes to be increased on American imports as a protest. When the democratically elected legitimate government of Guatemala was overthrown by American invaders under the pretext of "anti-communism," the indignation of the Swiss people was almost nationwide. A car driver told me that on the famous "White Peak" bridge of Lake Geneva and other scenic spots, slogans of "Yankees, go home!" appeared from time to time. Thus, when the American "McCarthy" investigation team prepared to come to Geneva to "interrogate" Americans in the "United Nations European Office" about whether they were "communists and their sympathizers," the people reacted that it was an infringement on Swiss sovereignty!

    More and more Swiss people realized the threat of American imperialists to human security, and the increasing concern of the people of Geneva that the Foreign Ministers' Conference would not be sabotaged by the United States was also obvious. July 21st was the last plenary session of the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina, and it was also the day with the most rumors. In the morning, when people rumored that a daily newspaper had revealed news about the United States' final obstruction of reaching an agreement, that newspaper was snapped up shortly after its publication. In the afternoon, when the foreign ministers entered the conference hall of the "League of Nations Building" one after another, even American reporters admitted that the crowd crowded at the entrance gave Molotov, Zhou Enlai, Mendès-France, Pham Van Dong... warm applause, and only showed indifference to Mr. Smith, the American representative.

    At noon on the 21st, the signing ceremony of the final part of the armistice agreement was held. In the crowd at the entrance of the "League of Nations Building," I found an old white-haired man who used to work for the "League of Nations." I asked him about his impressions of this Geneva Conference. He said, "During the League of Nations era, how many meetings were held in this building, but never once was an agreement to stop the war reached under conditions conducive to world peace. Our people have never been so concerned about the Foreign Ministers' Conference held in this building as they are today, and regard its reaching an agreement as Geneva's glory!"

    Yes, people will not forget that the "League of Nations" lost its morality and authority in the eyes of the people of the world. As early as the San Francisco Conference in 1945, Foreign Minister Molotov's speech on the establishment of the "United Nations" took the failure of the "League of Nations" as a lesson for the United Nations organization: "When it unscrupulously tried to turn it (the League of Nations) into a tool exclusively for the use of certain reactionary forces and privileged countries, the authority of the League of Nations fell particularly low." And how long ago was it that today's United Nations organization has become a tool of American aggressors on the Korean and other issues!

    However, history ultimately does not repeat itself. The course of the Geneva Conference and the achievements on the Indochina issue once again show that the era of imperialism doing whatever it wants in Asia is gone forever.

    At the last press conference on July 21st, Comrade Ilyichev, the spokesman of the Soviet delegation, explained the historical achievements of the conference and said to the reporters: "As we are about to part, I will not use the word 'goodbye!', but 'see you again!'" When our plane rose over Lake Geneva, I seemed to feel that due to the achievements of the Geneva Conference, the beautiful city of Geneva appeared even more glorious. For it, I would like to borrow Comrade Ilyichev's words and say: "Goodbye, Geneva!"

    II. Envoys of the Chinese People

    Our plane left Geneva one hour after the plane carrying Premier Zhou and other comrades of the Chinese delegation took off. At the invitation of fraternal countries, the itinerary of the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou on the way back home was a visit to the German Democratic Republic, the Polish People's Republic, the Soviet Union, and the Mongolian People's Republic.

    At the "Cointrin" airport in Geneva, Premier Zhou shook hands with the well-wishers from various countries one by one, and pointed out in his statement the great significance of the achievements of the Geneva Conference: "It has once again powerfully proved that international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultation." Premier Zhou said: "The restoration of peace in Indochina has eased international tensions and opened up avenues for further consultation to resolve other major international issues. I firmly believe that as long as peace-loving countries and people persevere in their efforts, world peace can be guaranteed. The People's Republic of China is willing to work together with relevant countries to achieve this goal." He thanked the Swiss and Geneva authorities and people for their assistance to the Chinese delegation. Dozens of photography, film, and fax reporters from various countries scrambled to take pictures, and the Geneva Broadcasting Company recorded this statement and broadcast it to Geneva and the world....

    This scene reminded people of the situation on the eve of the opening of the Geneva Conference.

    What I remember most clearly is that at that time, US Secretary of State Dulles attempted to gather his "friendly nations" to issue a "joint warning to China." The purpose of this provocative plan was naturally to prevent China from attending the Geneva Conference, which had been decided at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to be attended jointly by the five major powers. Failing to realize this plan, the American rulers actively organized the Pacific aggressive bloc; American newspapers representing official opinion unanimously promoted that the Geneva Conference was doomed to failure. They said that consultation was unimaginable, only "policy of strength"; they even said that if the Geneva Conference had any results, the first would be the "isolation" of the People's Republic of China.

    However, how merciless the facts are! The nearly three-month Geneva Conference was three months of tortuous and complex struggle between the world peace forces headed by the Soviet Union and the forces of war. Although the part of the Geneva Conference on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue did not reach the due agreement due to the sabotage of the United States, many Western diplomats, such as British Foreign Minister Mr. Eden, declared that this issue had not been erased, and that the settlement of this issue could not but have the participation of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In the process of discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina, every important progress was achieved when world public opinion overcame the unreasonable obstruction of the American representatives. When all parts of the world cheered the agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina, the American President, Secretary of State, and some senators hid aside and expressed dissatisfaction and resentment.

    It is not the People's Republic of China that has been isolated, but precisely the American rulers.

    From the beginning of the Geneva Conference, many Western politicians and newspapers with insight realized that the position of the People's Republic of China in international affairs must deal with Premier Zhou Enlai, and many representatives of Western industries came to discuss trade and cultural exchanges with the Chinese delegation... Because Premier Zhou Enlai and the representatives of the Chinese delegation are none other than the envoys of the six hundred million Chinese people who have been liberated, are carrying out great peaceful construction, and have achieved the glorious victory of resisting America and aiding Korea!

    All told, from Premier Zhou and other representatives returning to Geneva after visiting India, Burma and meeting with President Ho Chi Minh, completing their due positive role in the Geneva Conference, to setting off to visit the fraternal countries of the Democratic Republic of Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic, it was only about twenty days. I personally heard praise from many reporters from various countries for Premier Zhou's hard work, his enormous efforts to seek world peace and the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.

    At noon on the 23rd, we flew to Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic. The plane Premier Zhou was on had already arrived an hour earlier. (To be continued)

### 日内瓦归来

    日内瓦归来
    本报记者  吴文焘
    一、再见吧，日内瓦！
    七月二十三日，在绚烂的朝阳中我们离开日内瓦，飞向回国途中的第一站——柏林。
    从春末到夏中，日内瓦的湖光山色和往年并没有什么两样，但在这将近三个月里，全世界各个角落的人们都在道念着日内瓦，盼望着在日内瓦举行的外长会议达成积极的结果。日内瓦的人们在说：虽然从一九一八年到一九四六年日内瓦曾是国际联盟的所在地，他们的城市却从没有像今年这样为全世界所关注。
    在我没到日内瓦以前，我所知道的日内瓦，除了它曾是“国联”的所在地以外，就只限于它是有名的瑞士制表业的一个中心，是它那为历代诗人如哥德、拜伦等所歌颂过的自然景色，是百余年来没有经过战争的一个地方……。
    四月初旬我到日内瓦时，这座依山傍水的城市虽还不时弥漫着风雪，莱蒙湖边的梧桐虽还没有发出芽儿来，但是日内瓦的园林别墅和湖滨旅馆，依然吸引着无数的游客。由于两次世界大战的火焰都没有延及瑞士，一些资产阶级的人们和报刊就觉得战争也好，和平也好，只要瑞士保持超然的“中立”，有生意可作，那就够了。
    但是，当我亲身到了瑞士，我发现人民并不是那样“超然”的。春天，美国帝国主义利用在太平洋试验氢弹进行恫吓时，在人民的反对下，日内瓦州的议会里就一致通过了禁止使用原子武器的决议。翻开日内瓦的报纸，不仅反对美国阻挠东西贸易的文章日益多起来；更突出的是：在美国垄断资本企图用提高瑞士钟表进口税一倍的方法来吞噬瑞士钟表在美国的市场中，你可以看到各阶层人士要求对美国进口货加税，以示抗议的呼声。当危地马拉民选的合法政府被美国侵略者以“反共”为借口而推翻之后，瑞士人民的愤激几乎是遍及全国的。一个汽车司机告诉我：就在有名的莱蒙湖“白峰”桥上和其他名胜地方，不时出现“美国佬，回家去吧！”的标语。这样，当美国的“麦卡锡”调查组准备到日内瓦来“审问”在“联合国欧洲办事处”中的美国人有无“共产党及其同情者”时，人民反映那是对瑞士主权的侵犯！
    日益众多的瑞士人体会到美国帝国主义者对人类安全的威胁，日内瓦人的日益关怀着外长会议不被美国所破坏，也是显而易见的。七月二十一日那天，是日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的最后一次全会，也是谣言最多的一天。上午，当人们传说一家日报透露了有关美国最后阻碍达成协议的新闻时，那家报纸出版后不久就被抢购一空。下午，当外长们先后进入“国联大厦”的会议厅时，连美国记者也承认：拥挤在门口的群众对于莫洛托夫、周恩来、孟戴斯—弗朗斯、范文同……都报以热烈的鼓掌，只有对美国代表史密斯先生表示了冷淡。
    二十一日中午，停战协定的最后一部分签字仪式举行了。在“国联大厦”门口的人丛中，我发现了一个原在“国联”服务的白发老翁。我问他对这次日内瓦会议的感想，他说：“在国联时代，这个建筑里开过多少次会，但从没有一次在有利于世界和平的条件下达成过停止战争的协议。我国人们从来没有像今天这样关心着在这所建筑里所开的外长会议，并以其达成协议为日内瓦的光荣！”
    是的，人们忘不了当年的“国联”是在世界人民心目中失去了道义和权威的。远在一九四五年的旧金山会议上，莫洛托夫外长关于“联合国”的成立的演说里，就曾把“国联”的失败作为联合国组织的殷鉴：当“毫无忌惮地力图把它（国际联盟）变为专供某些反动势力和特权国家利用的工具的时候，国际联盟的权威更是特别低落下去了。”而曾几何时，今天的联合国组织又在朝鲜和其他若干问题上成了美国侵略者的工具！
    可是，历史究竟是不重演的。日内瓦会议的经过和关于印度支那问题的成就，再一次说明帝国主义在亚洲为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了。
    在七月二十一日的最后一次记者招待会上，苏联代表团的发言人伊利切夫同志说明了会议的历史成就后，向记者们说：“当我们行将分手的时候，我不用‘别了！’二字，而用‘再见！’”当我们的飞机升到莱蒙湖的上空，我似乎也感觉：由于日内瓦会议的成就，秀丽的日内瓦城显得更加光彩了。对于它，我愿借用伊利切夫同志的话说：“再见吧，日内瓦！”
  二、中国人民的使节
    我们的飞机是在周总理和中国代表团其他同志所乘飞机起飞后一小时离开日内瓦的。由于兄弟国家的邀请，以周总理为首的中国代表团在归国途中的日程是访问德意志民主共和国、波兰人民共和国、苏联和蒙古人民共和国。
    在日内瓦的“昆特连”飞机场上，周总理和各国的欢送者们一一握手，并在他的声明中指出日内瓦会议成就的伟大意义：“它又一次有力地证明：国际争端是可以经过和平协商获得解决的。”周总理说：“印度支那和平的恢复，缓和了国际紧张局势，并为进一步协商解决其他重大国际问题开辟了道路。我深信，只要爱好和平的国家和人民坚持不懈地努力，世界和平是可以得到保障的。中华人民共和国愿意与有关各国为达到这个目的而共同努力。”他感谢了瑞士和日内瓦当局和人民对于中国代表团的协助，几十个从各国来的摄影、电影和传真记者争着拍照，日内瓦广播公司把这一声明录下来，广播到日内瓦和全世界……。
    这个场面使人想起日内瓦会议开幕前夕的情形来。
    在我的记忆中最清楚的，是当时美国国务卿杜勒斯企图纠合他的“友邦”发表一个“对中国的联合警告”。这个挑衅计划的目的，自然是想阻止中国出席已在柏林四国外长会议上决定由五大国共同参加的日内瓦会议的。没有实现这一计划，美国的统治者们就积极活动组织太平洋侵略集团；代表官方意见的美国报刊，一致宣传日内瓦会议是注定要失败的。它们说协商是不可想像的，只有“实力政策”；它们甚至说如果日内瓦会议有什么结果的话，那首先将是中华人民共和国的被“孤立”。
    然而，事实是多么无情啊！近三个月的日内瓦会议，是以苏联为首的世界和平势力和战争势力进行了曲折复杂的斗争的三个月。日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的部分，虽然由于美国的怠工和破坏而没有达成应有的协议，但很多西方的外交家们，像英国外交大臣艾登先生，都声明这个问题并未被勾销，而且这个问题的解决，不能不有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的参加。在讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的过程中，每一个重要的进展，都是在全世界舆论克服了美国代表的无理阻挠而获得的。当全世界各地欢呼恢复印度支那和平取得协议的时候，美国的总统、国务卿和一些参议员们却躲在一边表示了不满和怀恨。
    孤立了的不是中华人民共和国，恰恰是美国的统治者们。
    从日内瓦会议一开始，不少西方有见识的政治家和报纸就认识到中华人民共和国在国际事务中所占的地位，必须和周恩来总理打交道，不少的西方产业界的代表们来和中国代表团商谈贸易和文化交流问题……因为周恩来总理和中国代表团的代表们不是什么别人，而是解放了的、进行着伟大和平建设的、并取得抗美援朝的光辉胜利的六亿中国人民的使节！
    算起来，周总理和其他的代表同志们从访问印度、缅甸和与胡志明主席会谈回到日内瓦来、完成了自己对日内瓦会议所应起的积极作用，到动身访问民主德国、波兰、苏联和蒙古人民共和国各兄弟国家，只有二十来天光景。我亲自听到不少来自各国的记者们对于周总理风尘仆仆、为求世界和平、为求不同社会制度的国家间和平共处所作巨大努力的赞誉。
    二十三日的晌午，我们飞抵德意志民主共和国的首都柏林。周总理所乘的那一架飞机，已经先期一小时到达了。（未完待续）
