    Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 11th. The largest flood peak of the Huai River has passed Bengbu City, and water levels in the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River have generally decreased. At Wangjiaba, between Henan and Anhui provinces, the highest water level of the Huai River reached 29.43 meters, but has now dropped to 26.01 meters. The water level at Zhengyangguan, Anhui Province, has dropped from 26.41 meters to 24.61 meters. The water level in Bengbu City has also dropped from 22.14 meters to 21.85 meters. The floodwaters discharged from the middle reaches of the Huai River are being blocked and stored in Hongze Lake, which is controlled by the Sanhe Sluice. The water level of Hongze Lake is continuing to rise and is expected to reach its peak in the next few days. Flood control work in northern Jiangsu Province on the lower reaches of the Huai River has entered its most tense stage, with more than 200,000 local laborers working to defend the dikes of Hongze Lake, the Grand Canal, and the Subei Irrigation Main Canal. Currently, the Sanhe Sluice is discharging Huai River floodwaters at a flow rate of 9,800 cubic meters per second, and the Gaoliangjian Water Intake Sluice is discharging Huai River floodwaters at a flow rate of 780 cubic meters per second. Due to the control of the Huai River's discharge by the Sanhe Sluice, the Grand Canal water level in Gaoyou County, northern Jiangsu Province, has not yet exceeded the guaranteed water level, playing a significant role in ensuring the safety of the Grand Canal dikes.
    As the Huai River floodwaters are receding slowly, and the water level in many places remains above the guaranteed level for a relatively long time, the Huai River Flood Control Headquarters is calling on all Huai River flood control personnel to make persistent efforts, maintain high vigilance, overcome complacency, and fight for the final victory over the flood. Currently, the laborers participating in the Huai River flood control are taking advantage of the sunny weather to rush to build protective projects. To prepare for the upcoming flood peak, the people of Gaoyou, Baoying, Jiangdu, and other counties in northern Jiangsu Province have comprehensively repaired more than 200 li of the Grand Canal embankment and are continuing to rush to build wind and wave protection projects.

    淮河上中游水位下降最大洪峰已过蚌埠市
    淮河下游江苏省北部的防汛工作进入最紧张阶段
    【新华社蚌埠十一日电】淮河最大的一次洪峰已经过了蚌埠市，淮河上、中游的水位普遍下降。河南和安徽两省之间的王家坝，淮河最高水位曾达二十九点四三公尺，现已降到二十六点零一公尺。安徽省正阳关的水位已由二十六点四一公尺降到二十四点六一公尺。蚌埠市的水位也由二十二点一四公尺降到二十一点八五公尺。淮河中游下泄的洪水，都被拦蓄在由三河闸加以控制的洪泽湖里。目前洪泽湖的水位正在继续上涨，预料最近数日内可达最高峰。淮河下游江苏省北部的防汛工作已进入最紧张阶段，当地二十多万民工正全力扼守着洪泽湖、运河和苏北灌溉总渠的堤防。现在三河闸正以九千八百秒公方的流量排着淮河洪水，高良涧进水闸也以七百八十秒公方的流量排着淮河洪水。由于淮河下泄的洪水受到三河闸的控制，江苏省北部高邮县的运河水位至今没有超过保证水位，对保证运河堤防的安全起了重大作用。
    由于目前淮河洪水降落还很缓慢，很多地方水位仍在保证水位以上，高水位的时间又比较长。淮河防汛指挥机关号召全体淮河防汛人员再接再厉，百倍警惕，克服麻痹思想，为最后战胜洪水而斗争。现在，参加淮河防汛的民工正趁着天气放晴赶做防护工程。为了迎接即将到来的洪峰，江苏省北部高邮、宝应、江都等县人民已全面检修了二百多里长的运河大堤，并在继续赶做防风挡浪工程。
