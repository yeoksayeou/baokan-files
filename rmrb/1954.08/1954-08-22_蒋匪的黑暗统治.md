	Chiang Bandit's Dark Rule
	Extorting Military Expenses
Under the command of American bayonets, the Chiang Kai-shek gang is using the old methods of forcibly levying exorbitant taxes and issuing banknotes to extort military expenses from the people of Taiwan.

According to Taiwan's "China Economy" monthly, the amount of money Chiang's bandits extorted from the people of Taiwan through various exorbitant taxes increased more than 22 times in 1953 compared to 1949, and in the first five months of this year, it increased by 22.7% compared to the same period last year. Many factories and businesses in Taiwan are closing down in batches due to this exorbitant taxation. For example, Taiwan originally had 2,226 trading companies, but only 1,657 remained when they registered in June of this year. Unable to endure the extortion of Chiang's bandits, the people of Taiwan are constantly fighting against exorbitant taxes. Despite Chiang's bandits using all kinds of brutal means, they are still unable to achieve the extortion target of the annual budget. The amount of counterfeit Taiwan currency issued in 1954 also increased more than 15 times compared to 1949. Recently, Chiang's bandits are preparing to issue a new currency in order to further extort the people of Taiwan, just like they issued "Gold Yuan Certificates" in 1948. Chiang's bandits' indiscriminate printing of banknotes has caused serious inflation in Taiwan. According to the greatly suppressed figures published by Chiang's bandits, the purchasing power of counterfeit Taiwan currency in March 1954 decreased by 84.13% compared to June 1949. In other words, the actual value of the income of the people of Taiwan in March 1954 was more than 84% lower than in June 1949, and the actual figure is much larger than this.

The American "Economic Advisory Group" that recently arrived in Taiwan said that they were invited by Chiang's bandits "to help develop an economy that can sustain Taiwan's huge army." However, even a reporter from Japan's "Industrial Economic News" said that despite American "aid," expecting Taiwan's eight million people to support 600,000 remnant bandit troops is simply "absurd"!

It is precisely this "absurd" thing that Chiang's bandits do according to the wishes of their American masters that makes the lives of the people of Taiwan worse day by day.

	Terrible Diseases
According to Taipei dispatches from Agence France-Presse and Reuters on August 5: Tao Rongqin (transliteration), "Chairman of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association" of Taiwan, said at a press conference that there are currently 160,000 people in Taiwan suffering from lung disease, and one person dies from this terrible disease every 43 minutes. And there are only thirteen anti-tuberculosis clinics in the whole of Taiwan, with less than 3,000 beds. Tao Rongqin asked private individuals to help medical institutions more and to fund the families of poor patients.

It is not difficult to understand why Tao Rongqin appealed to private individuals instead of appealing to the remnant bandit authorities in Taiwan, because the remnant bandit authorities are busy training 100,000 new recruits every year according to the instructions of their American masters, so where is the money to increase clinics and beds!

From this incident, we can also see how deep the suffering of the people of Taiwan is!

    蒋匪的黑暗统治
    勒索军费
    在美国刺刀指挥下，蒋匪帮正在用强征苛捐杂税和滥发钞票的老办法向台湾人民勒索军费。
    据台湾“中国经济”月刊透露，蒋匪采用各种苛捐杂税向台湾人民勒索的款项，一九五三年比一九四九年增加二十二倍以上，今年头五个月又比去年同期增加百分之二十二点七。台湾许多工厂商行由于这种横征暴敛正一批批地倒闭。例如，台湾原有贸易商二千二百二十六家，但在今年六月登记时，仅剩一千六百五十七家了。台湾人民由于无法忍受蒋匪的勒索，正不断地进行抵抗苛捐杂税的斗争，尽管蒋匪用尽各种凶残手段，但仍无法达到每年预算的勒索目标。一九五四年伪台币的发行额也比一九四九年增加了十五倍以上。最近，蒋匪更准备发行一种新的货币，以便和一九四八年发行“金元券”一样，来进一步勒索台湾人民。蒋匪滥印钞票引起了台湾严重的通货膨胀，仅据蒋匪公布的大大压低的数字，一九五四年三月伪台币的购买力比一九四九年六月下降了百分之八十四点一三，也就是说，台湾人民一九五四年三月收入的实际价值比一九四九年六月要损失百分之八十四以上，而实际数字比这个还要大得多。
    最近到达台湾的美国“经济顾问团”说，他们被蒋匪请来，“是为了帮助发展一个能够维持台湾庞大军队的经济”。可是，就连日本“产业经济新闻”记者也说，尽管有美国的“援助”，期望台湾八百万人口支持六十万残匪军队简直是“荒唐”！
    正是蒋匪这种按照美国主子意旨干出来的“荒唐”事情，才使台湾人民的生活一天比一天坏下去。
      可怕的疾病
    据八月五日法新社和路透社的台北电讯报道：台湾“防痨协会主席”陶荣钦（译音）在记者招待会上说，台湾目前有十六万人患肺病，每四十三分钟就有一个人死于这种可怕的疾病。而全台湾总共只有十三个抗痨诊疗所，病床不到三千张。陶荣钦要求私人更多地帮助医疗机构，并资助穷苦病人的家庭。
    为什么陶荣钦不向台湾残匪当局呼吁，而向私人呼吁，不难理解，是因为残匪当局正按照美国主子的指使，为每年训练十万新兵而忙碌，那还有钱去增加什么诊疗所和病床呢！
    从这件事上也可以看出：台湾人民的疾苦是多么深重！
