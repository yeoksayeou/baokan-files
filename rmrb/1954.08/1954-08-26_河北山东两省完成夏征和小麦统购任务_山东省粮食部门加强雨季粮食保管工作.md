Hebei and Shandong Provinces Complete Summer Grain Tax and Wheat Unified Purchase Tasks
Shandong Province Grain Departments Strengthen Grain Storage Work During Rainy Season

The task of summer grain tax and unified purchase of wheat in Hebei Province has been completed. According to statistics up to August 6, the amount of wheat stored in the province exceeded the planned tax collection and purchase quantity by 6.8 percent.

The broad masses of peasants in Hebei Province showed great enthusiasm for paying summer grain tax and selling surplus wheat. The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Raoyang County, which had a bumper harvest, delivered all 35,000 jin of public grain to be paid and 37,000 jin of wheat to be sold to the state in one and a half days. In Jiamu Village, Xingtang County, under the publicity and leadership of party members and members of the Communist Youth League, the task of storing more than 64,000 jin of wheat was completed in one day. Peasants in Pang Village Township, Mancheng County, put forward the slogans of "sunbathe every moment the sun appears" and "sunbathe in small amounts and frequently," and promptly dried and cleaned more than 320,000 jin of wheat and sold it to the state.

After selling their wheat, the peasants, in addition to purchasing production and living supplies, actively returned overdue agricultural loans and deposited temporarily unused money in the State Bank. In July, the peasants in the province returned a total of 51.1999 billion yuan in agricultural loans to the state and saved 36.215 billion yuan. (Zhang Yaoxian)

Peasants in Shandong Province actively paid summer grain tax and sold surplus grain. According to statistics up to August 9, the province's summer grain tax task has been fully completed, and the amount of unified purchase of wheat stored in warehouses exceeded the original plan by 39.89 percent.

The summer grain tax and summer grain unified purchase work in Shandong Province started successively in mid-July, and by the beginning of August, most areas had basically completed the task. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams achieved "paying public grain first, selling surplus wheat first." Eight agricultural production cooperatives and fifty-eight mutual aid teams in Wantang Township, Juye County, took the lead in selling surplus grain, and the wheat sold to the state by the township exceeded the original plan by 30,000 jin. Four agricultural production cooperatives in Shanggao Township, Tai'an County, first dried and cleaned 50,000 jin of wheat and sold it to the state, driving the peasants in the township to quickly sell 293,000 jin of wheat and pay 92,000 jin of public grain. After selling their surplus grain, the peasants actively invested in expanding production. The Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhoumazhuang, the 13th district of Ju County, invested 90 percent of the proceeds from selling wheat into production. Many areas have also newly established credit cooperatives and credit mutual aid teams. (Wang Ruizhi)

The summer grain tax and unified purchase of wheat in Shandong Province are being stored in warehouses continuously, and the grain departments in various places are actively strengthening the grain storage work during the rainy season.

The Grain Department of the Shandong Provincial People's Government issued instructions in mid-July, requiring all localities to earnestly do a good job in checking warehouses, preventing insects, and sun-drying wet grain during the rainy season. L聊城, 菏泽, 德州, and 泰安 regions, where new wheat was stored in warehouses earlier, have successively held meetings to arrange grain storage work, and sent a large number of cadres to go deep into grassroots grain depots and supply and marketing cooperatives to understand the grain storage situation. The Grain Bureau of the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office, at the meeting of the heads of storage and transportation sections of the county grain bureaus held in mid-July, arranged to inspect all wheat once and to sun-dry all wheat exceeding the standard moisture content. The inspection team organized by the Dezhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office has gone to Dezhou City, Yucheng County and other places to specifically inspect the grain storage work. Liaocheng Prefecture has successively organized more than 9,600 people to participate in sun-drying grain. By the end of July, according to incomplete statistics from Liaocheng, Heze, Changwei and other regions, more than 260 million jin of grain had been sun-dried, and more than 210 million jin of grain had been sealed by airtight methods. In order to eliminate grain depot pests, the grain departments in various places also actively studied the experience of Yuhang County, Zhejiang Province, in storing grain.

    河北山东两省完成夏征和小麦统购任务
    山东省粮食部门加强雨季粮食保管工作
    河北省夏征和统购小麦的任务已经完成。据截至八月六日的统计，全省入库的小麦，超过计划征收和收购数量百分之六点八。
    河北省广大农民缴纳夏征公粮和出售余麦的热情很高。获得丰收的饶阳县五公村耿长锁农业生产合作社在一天半时间内，把应缴的三万五千斤公粮和卖给国家的三万七千斤小麦全部交给国家。行唐县第一区贾木村在党员、团员宣传、带动下，一天就完成了六万四千多斤小麦的入库任务。满城县庞村乡农民提出“太阳露一时，晒一时”和“零晒、勤晒”的口号，及时把三十二万多斤小麦晒干扬净缴售给国家。
    农民们卖出小麦以后，除了购买生产和生活用品，还积极归还到期农业贷款，把暂时不用的钱存入国家银行。七月份，全省农民共交还国家农业贷款五百一十一亿九千九百多万元，储蓄三百六十二亿一千五百多万元。（张耀先）

    山东省各地农民积极缴纳夏征公粮，出卖余粮，截至八月九日的统计，全省夏征任务已如数完成，统购小麦入库数量超过原计划百分之三十九点八九。
    山东各地夏征和夏季粮食统购工作从七月中旬相继展开，到八月初，绝大部分地区都基本上完成了任务。许多农业生产合作社和互助组作到了“缴公粮在先，卖余麦在前”。巨野县万堂乡八个农业生产合作社和五十八个互助组积极带头出卖余粮，全乡卖给国家的小麦，超过原计划三万斤。泰安县上高乡四个农业生产合作社首先把五万斤小麦晒干扬净卖给国家，带动全乡农民迅速出售小麦二十九万三千多斤，缴纳公粮九万二千多斤。农民们卖出余粮以后，积极投资扩大生产。莒县第十三区周马庄胜利农业生产合作社把百分之九十的卖麦款投入了生产。不少地区还新成立了信用合作社和信用互助组。（王瑞芝）

    山东省各地夏征和统购的小麦正在源源入库，各地粮食部门积极加强雨季粮食保管工作。
    山东省人民政府粮食厅在七月中旬曾经发出指示，要求各地切实做好雨季查仓、防虫、曝晒湿粮等工作。新小麦入库较早的聊城、菏泽、德州、泰安等专区，都先后召开会议，布置了粮食保管工作，并派出大批干部，深入基层粮库和供销合作社，了解粮食保管情况。聊城专署粮食局在七月中旬召开的各县粮食局储运股长会议上，就布置将所有小麦普遍检查一遍，并将超过标准水分的小麦普遍晒一遍。德州专署组织的检查组，已经到德州市、禹城县等地具体检查粮食保管工作。聊城专区已先后组织九千六百多人投入晒粮工作。到七月底，据聊城、菏泽、昌潍等专区的不完全统计，已曝晒粮食两亿六千多万斤，用密闭的办法密闭粮食两亿一千余万斤。为了消除粮仓虫害，各地粮食部门还积极学习浙江省余杭县保管粮食的经验。
