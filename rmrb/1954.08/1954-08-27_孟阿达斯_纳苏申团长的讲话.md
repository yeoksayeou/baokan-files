Your Excellency Premier of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Respected Leaders of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Dear Guests:

    At this very honorable meeting tonight, please allow me to say a few words on behalf of all members of the Indonesian Art Troupe.

    Your Excellency! Tonight, we have received the most precious respect from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. We have been in Beijing as state guests for nineteen days, and if nothing else interferes, we will leave Beijing on August 30, 1954, to go to other major cities in China.

    During our stay in Beijing, we have received very good hospitality from the leaders of the Central People's Government, and we have had the opportunity to visit several beautiful places, greatly increasing our understanding of China.

    Your excellent hospitality towards us and the respect shown for our work in introducing Indonesian art are unforgettable to us. On behalf of all members of the Indonesian Art Troupe, I express my deepest gratitude. I hope that the purpose of our work, which I have mentioned several times in public, namely, to further strengthen the ties in all aspects, especially in culture, between the People's Republic of China and its people and the Republic of Indonesia and its people, can be realized. Finally, let us drink to the security and happiness of Indonesia and China!

    在今晚这次非常荣幸的会见中，请允许我代表印度尼西亚艺术团全体团员讲几句话。
    阁下！今天晚上，我们受到中华人民共和国中央人民政府最珍贵的尊重。我们在北京作国宾已经十九天了，如果没有其他的事情耽搁，我们将于一九五四年八月三十日离开北京到中国其他的大城市去。
    在北京期间，我们受到中央人民政府首长们非常良好的款待，我们有机会参观几处优美的地方，大大地增进了我们对中国的了解。
    您们对我们非常良好的款待及对我们介绍印度尼西亚艺术的工作所表现的尊重，使我们一生难忘。我代表印度尼西亚艺术团全体团员深深地表示感谢。希望我几次在大会上所提出的我们的工作目的，这就是使中华人民共和国及其人民和印度尼西亚共和国及其人民之间在各方面，特别是在文化方面的联系更加密切的愿望能获得实现。最后，让我们为印度尼西亚和中国两国的安全和幸福干杯！
