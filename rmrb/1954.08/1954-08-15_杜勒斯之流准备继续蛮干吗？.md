Are the Dulles Clique Preparing to Continue Being Reckless?
　　Wu Fei

    In order to occupy Taiwan for a long time and use the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandits to continue opposing the Chinese people, the United States' planning and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits' conclusion of a military so-called "bilateral common security treaty" has reached its most intense stage recently.
    At the same time, American military aid to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits has reached its highest point since the Chiang Kai-shek gang was driven out of mainland China by the Chinese people. As everyone knows, when the Korean War stopped, American military aid to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits had already greatly increased; now, with the cessation of the war in Indochina, American military aid to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits is becoming increasingly intensified. According to Pan-Asia News Agency, which has close ties with Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the United States will allocate 80 million US dollars in "additional assistance" to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits from the strategic materials originally destined for the Indochina battlefield. Although not long ago the United States decided to increase the amount of "aid" to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits from 400 million US dollars to more than 500 million US dollars annually. It is particularly noteworthy that the United States has recently stepped up its expansion of Chiang Kai-shek's naval and air forces. According to the United States International News Service, the United States "will put more emphasis on the expansion of the Kuomintang Navy." Now the United States has sent naval officers to Taiwan to serve as chiefs of staff of the American "Military Advisory Group" which specializes in training Chiang Kai-shek's army. At the same time, the first batch of destroyers that the United States recently decided to aid Chiang Kai-shek's bandits will soon be shipped to Taiwan. According to Lieutenant Colonel Miller, deputy chief of the Naval Section of the American "Military Advisory Group," in the future, "American-aided warships will be handed over to the Kuomintang Navy." Not only that, after the incident of the U.S. aircraft provocation, according to Reuters, quoting "authoritative sources" in Washington, the United States will ship a batch of Sabre jet aircraft to Chiang Kai-shek's air force. Reuters also said that this was to "increase their (Chiang Kai-shek's bandits') attacks on (China's) mainland shipping and islands controlled by the Communists." According to a Reuters Taipei dispatch quoting a message from Chiang Kai-shek's "United Daily News," the United States will greatly expand the so-called "Military Assistance Advisory Group" stationed in Taiwan, thereby turning the "work of training the Kuomintang army" "from defensive training to offensive training."
    It should also be pointed out that senior American military personnel have been coming and going to Taiwan very frequently recently. Such as US First Fleet Commander Phillips, US Far East Air Force Commander Partridge, US Seventh Fleet Task Force 72 Commander Kivette, etc. are all about to or have already arrived in Taiwan. People can see at a glance that this group of black crows does not bring peaceful information.
    On August 3, US Secretary of State Dulles openly declared that "American planes and warships" would continue to occupy "Taiwan and the nearby Penghu Islands" to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. This shows that the Dulles clique is preparing to continue being reckless. But the Chinese people have repeatedly stated that the liberation of Taiwan is our country's internal affair, and no other country is allowed to interfere. Moreover, historical facts have also proved that the Chinese people are not to be insulted, and that being an enemy of the Chinese people is bound to suffer a terrible defeat. Didn't the United States once aid Chiang Kai-shek's bandits with six billion US dollars? The result was that the American aggressive forces were driven out of mainland China along with Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Didn't the United States also bet 20 billion US dollars and a large number of troops in Korea? As a result, the war had to stop in place. Didn't the United States spend nearly 3 billion US dollars and send a military advisory group to Indochina? The result was that Indochina restored the peace that the United States "disliked." Now the United States is increasing Chiang Kai-shek's bandits by 100 million US dollars a year, giving Chiang Kai-shek's bandits some planes and warships, plus some military advisory groups, can they occupy China's territory of Taiwan, can they "attack" the mainland? Isn't this daydreaming in broad daylight? Facts have proved that all these crazy activities of the Dulles clique cannot get the support of any sober-minded people in the world, including the United States, and cannot shake the sacred belief of the Chinese people in liberating their own territory of Taiwan to complete the cause of liberation!
    After the Indochina armistice, Dulles issued a statement saying: "The important thing is not to be sad about the past, but to seize future opportunities." However, if the "future opportunities" that the Dulles clique "seizes" are to be an enemy of the Chinese people to the end, the result will still be to "be sad about the past," because the result of greater adventures is greater failure, which is the inevitable end of all aggressors.

    杜勒斯之流准备继续蛮干吗？
  　吴非
    为了长期侵占台湾，利用残余蒋匪进一步与中国人民作对，近来美国策划和蒋匪缔结军事性的所谓“共同安全双边条约”的活动达到了最紧张的阶段。
    与此同时，美国对蒋匪的军事援助，已到达蒋匪帮被中国人民赶出中国大陆以来的最高潮。大家知道，当朝鲜战争停止时，美国对蒋匪的军事援助就已经大大增加；如今随着印度支那战火的停息，美国对蒋匪的军事援助愈益加紧起来。据和蒋匪有密切联系的泛亚社透露，美国将从原定运往印度支那战场的战略物资中，拨给蒋匪八千万美元的“额外援助”。虽然不久前美国已决定把给蒋匪的“援助”数目从每年四亿美元增加到五亿美元以上。特别值得注意的是，美国近来加紧扩充蒋匪的海空军力量。据美国国际新闻社报道，美国“将要更加着重国民党海军的扩充”，现在美国已派遣了海军军官到台湾去充任专司训练蒋匪军的美国“军事顾问团”的参谋长。同时，美国最近决定援助蒋匪的第一批驱逐舰即将运到台湾，据美国“军事顾问团”海军科副科长米勒中校透露，将来“还要有美国援助的军舰交给国民党海军”。不仅如此，在美机挑衅事件发生后，据路透社引华盛顿“权威人士”的话透露，美国将把一批佩刀式喷气飞机启运交给蒋匪空军。路透社并且说，这是为了“增加他们（蒋匪）对（中国）大陆航运和共产党控制下的岛屿的袭击”。又据路透社台北消息引蒋匪“联合日报”消息透露，美国将把美国驻在台湾的所谓“军事援助顾问团”大加扩充，从而把“训练国民党军队的工作”“从防御训练改为进攻训练”。
    还应该指出，美国的高级军事人员最近来去台湾非常频繁。如美国第一舰队司令菲利普斯、美国远东空军司令帕特里奇、美国第七舰队第七十二特遣队司令基维特等。都即将或已经到达台湾。人们一看便知，这群黑色的乌鸦所带来的决非和平的信息。
    八月三日，美国国务卿杜勒斯更公开宣称“美国飞机和军舰”要继续侵占“台湾和附近的澎湖列岛”，阻止中国人民解放台湾。这就表明杜勒斯之流是准备继续蛮干的。但是中国人民一再申明，解放台湾是我国的内政，绝不容许别国来干涉。而且历史事实也已经证明：中国人民是不可侮的，与中国人民为敌是必然要遭受惨败的。美国不是曾经援助过蒋匪六十亿美元吗？结果是美国侵略势力随着蒋匪被赶出了中国大陆。美国在朝鲜不也是投下了二百亿美元和大批军队的赌注吗？结果战争还不得不在原地停了下来。美国在印度支那不也是花了将近三十亿美元和派了军事顾问团吗？结果是印度支那恢复了美国所“不喜欢”的和平。现在美国给蒋匪每年增加一亿美元，给蒋匪一些飞机和兵舰再加上什么军事顾问团就可以霸占得住中国的领土台湾，就可以“进攻”大陆吗？这不是在那里白昼做梦吗？事实证明，杜勒斯之流的这一切疯狂活动，得不到全世界包括美国在内的任何头脑清醒的人的支持，更不能丝毫动摇中国人民解放自己领土台湾以完成解放事业的神圣信念！
    印度支那停战以后，杜勒斯曾经发表声明说：“重要的问题是不要悲伤过去，而要抓住未来的机会。”可是，如果杜勒斯之流“抓住”的“未来机会”是与中国人民为敌到底的话，结果还是不得不“悲伤过去”的，因为更大冒险的结果是更大的失败，这是一切侵略者的必然下场。
