Tianjin industrialists and businessmen have gained a lot from discussing the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China. During the discussion, many people believed that the provisions in the draft constitution were in line with the interests of the people of the whole country, and of course, also in line with the interests of industrialists and businessmen. In the future, the path for industrialists and businessmen to take has become clearer. Some people said: "As long as we love the country, abide by the law, and operate honestly, and accept socialist transformation, the future is bright." The capitalist agent of the private Guoguang Rubber Factory examined his past erroneous thinking of disregarding national interests and his attitude of passive management at the discussion meeting, and expressed that he would love the country, abide by the law, improve management and strive to embark on the advanced form of state capitalism in the future. More than 20 representatives of the sewing industry in the first district made a guarantee not to commit the "five poisons" at the discussion meeting on the draft constitution.

Some industrial and commercial figures also have a further understanding of the importance of obeying the leadership of the state-owned economy and accepting the supervision of the working masses. The private Tongheng Foreign Paper Firm used to have high costs and low quality when making cultural and educational instruments. With the guidance and assistance of the Tianjin branch of the China Department Store Company, it reduced costs and improved quality. The manager of this paper firm used this fact at the discussion meeting to illustrate the importance of obeying the leadership of the state-owned economy. During the discussion of the draft constitution, Li Zhongming, manager of the private Zhonghe Weaving Factory, adopted the suggestions of the staff and workers to improve the output and quality of cotton cloth, and prepared to establish a cotton yarn statistics system within the factory to create conditions for striving for joint public-private ownership.

    天津市工商业者讨论宪法草案有许多收获
    天津市工商业者讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案有不少收获。在讨论中，有不少人认为，宪法草案上的规定都是符合全国人民的利益的，当然也符合工商业者的利益，今后，工商业者应走的道路更加明确了。有的人说：“只要我们爱国守法，老实经营，接受社会主义改造，前途是光明的。”私营国光橡胶厂资方代理人在讨论会上检查了他过去不顾国家利益的错误思想和消极经营的态度，并表示今后要爱国守法改善经营管理，争取走上国家资本主义的高级形式。第一区缝纫业的二十多户代表，在宪法草案的讨论会上提出了不犯“五毒”的保证。
    部分工商界人士对服从国营经济的领导和接受工人群众的监督的重要性，也有了进一步的认识。私营同恒洋纸行过去做文教仪器时成本高、质量低，经过中国百货公司天津市公司的指导和帮助，降低了成本，改进了质量。这个纸行的经理在讨论会上用这个事实来说明服从国营经济领导的重要。私营中和织布工厂经理李仲明在讨论宪法草案期间采纳了职工的建议，提高了棉布的产量和质量，并准备在厂内建立棉纱的统计制度，为争取公私合营创造条件。　（新华社）
