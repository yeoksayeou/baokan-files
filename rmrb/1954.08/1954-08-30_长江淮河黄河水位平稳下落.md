Xinhua News Agency, August 28th:

    The nationwide flood control struggle has achieved its first-stage victory. Currently, the water levels of the Yangtze, Huaihe, and Yellow Rivers have all become stable, and some have begun to fall. The people of Wuhan and Huangshi, major industrial cities in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, have been fighting floods that exceeded historical high water levels for more than a month, and are still carrying out production and work normally. The Jingjiang Dam, which protects the lives and property of three million people on the Jianghan Plain, has withstood the test of five severe floods and still stands safely. In the areas north of the Jingjiang River that were not or were less affected by flooding, early rice has generally had a bumper harvest, and middle rice is ripening and will soon be harvested. In the Su County area of Anhui Province, in the middle reaches of the Huaihe River, which has suffered from severe waterlogging for many years, nearly 10 million mu of farmland have been spared or reduced from waterlogging disasters this year, thanks to the drainage projects carried out in the Huaihe River management project over the past few years, in the face of rainstorms unseen in decades. The Sanhe闸 (Sanhe Sluice Gate) in the lower reaches of the Huaihe River effectively controlled this year's exceptionally large flood in the Huaihe River, and a bumper harvest of more than 10 million mu of rice is expected in northern Jiangsu Province. In Xinghua County, the largest rice-producing area, some fields can yield 600 jin per mu, an average increase of about 50 jin per mu compared to last year.

    Since the main rain belt stagnated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River at the end of July and then moved north, the continuous rainstorms in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin have stopped developing. On August 9, along the 2,000-kilometer Yangtze River, except for slight increases in local areas of Hankou and Xindi, the other 27 hydrological stations reported that water levels were generally declining simultaneously. As of August 28, the water level in Yichang City, below the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, had fallen to 53.15 meters, a decrease of 2.58 meters from this year's highest water level. The water level in Shashi had fallen to 42.71 meters, a decrease of 1.95 meters from this year's highest water level. The water level in Jianli had fallen to 34.18 meters, a decrease of 2.39 meters from this year's highest water level. The water level in Chenglingji had fallen to 32.72 meters, a decrease of 1.64 meters from this year's highest water level. The water level in Hankou also began to fall on August 19, and had fallen to 29.39 meters by August 28, a decrease of 3.4 decimeters from this year's highest water level. The water level in Huangshi City had also fallen to 26.20 meters. However, the water levels of the Yangtze River in Jiujiang, Anqing, Nanjing and other places in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are still rising slowly due to the top-pushing effect of the sea tide.

    After August 6, the water level in the Huaihe River basin also began to slowly decline. As of August 28, the water level in Runheji had fallen to 23.77 meters, falling to 1.23 meters below the warning water level. The water level in Zhengyangguan had fallen to 23.44 meters, falling to 1.31 meters below the guaranteed water level. The water level in Bengbu had fallen to 20.20 meters, falling to 1.05 meters below the guaranteed water level. The water level of Hongze Lake has also begun to decline in recent days, while the water level of Gaoyou Lake remains at around 9.19 meters.

    The Yellow River basin has not been hit by continuous rainstorms this year, but there have been local rainstorms, and five floods have occurred from the beginning of August to now. The last flood passed through Luokou in Shandong Province at 4:00 a.m. on the 24th and flowed into the Bohai Sea. The people along the Yellow River have safely survived five floods. The crops in the areas on both sides of the lower reaches of the Yellow River are growing well and a bumper harvest is expected.

    At present, except for the Yellow River, where the flood season ends later, and the people along the river are continuing to step up prevention, the flood control situation in the Ziya River, Daqing River, Yongding River, Nanyun River, and Beiyun River in Hebei Province is becoming tense due to heavy rains in the middle and lower reaches. The people of Hebei Province and Tianjin are systematically repairing dikes and rushing to repair dangerous works, making multifaceted efforts to overcome the floods.

    长江淮河黄河水位平稳下落
    【新华社二十八日讯】全国规模的防汛斗争，已取得第一阶段的胜利。目前，长江、淮河和黄河的水位都已趋于平稳，有的并开始下落。长江中游工业重镇武汉市、黄石市人民，已和高出历史最高水位的洪水搏斗了一个多月，至今仍在正常地进行生产和工作。保卫着江汉平原上三百万人民生命财产安全的荆江大堤，经过五次险恶洪水的考验，现在仍安然屹立着。荆江北岸没有受渍和受渍较轻的地区，早稻已普遍丰收，中稻正在黄熟，很快就可收割。淮河中游历年内涝严重的安徽省宿县专区，由于几年来在治淮工程中做了除涝工程，今年在几十年来未有的大雨情况下，近一千万亩农田免除和减轻了内涝灾害。淮河下游三河闸，有效地控制了今年淮河特大的洪水，江苏省北部一千多万亩水稻丰收在望。产稻最多的兴化县，多的每亩可产六百斤，平均每亩可比去年多收五十斤左右。
    自七月底停滞在长江中游和下游的主要雨带北移后，长江中下游和淮河流域连续性的暴雨即停止发展。八月九日，长江二千公里沿线，除汉口、新堤局部地区稍有涨势外，据其余的二十七个水文站报告，水位普遍同时下降。到八月二十八日止，长江三峡以下的宜昌市，水位已落到五三点一五公尺，比今年的最高水位下落了二点五八公尺。沙市的水位已落到四二点七一公尺，比今年最高水位下落了一点九五公尺。监利的水位已落到三四点一八公尺，比今年最高水位下落了二点三九公尺。城陵矶的水位已落到三二点七二公尺，比今年最高水位下落了一点六四公尺。汉口的水位也在八月十九日开始下降，到二十八日已落到二九点三九公尺，比今年最高水位下落了三点四公寸。黄石市的水位也已落到二六点二零公尺。惟长江下游受海潮顶托，九江、安庆、南京等地长江水位仍在缓涨中。
    八月六日以后，淮河流域的水位也开始缓缓下落。到八月二十八日止，润河集的水位已落到二三点七七公尺，退到警戒水位以下一点二三公尺。正阳关的水位已落到二三点四四公尺，已退到保证水位以下一点三一公尺。蚌埠的水位已落到二零点二零公尺，已退到保证水位以下一点零五公尺。洪泽湖的水位，近日也开始下降，高邮湖水位仍维持在九点一九公尺左右。
    黄河流域今年未曾遭到连续性暴雨袭击，但局部地区也曾有过暴雨，从八月初到现在已发生五次洪水。最后一次洪水已在二十四日上午四时，过山东省的泺口，流入渤海。黄河沿岸人民已平安渡过五次洪水。黄河下游两岸地区，作物生长很好，丰收在望。
    目前，除汛期结束较晚的黄河，沿岸人民正继续加紧防范外，河北省境内的子牙河、大清河、永定河、南运河、北运河，由于中游和下游都下了大雨，防汛趋于紧张。河北省和天津市人民，正有计划地培修堤防、抢修险工，为战胜洪水作多方面努力。
