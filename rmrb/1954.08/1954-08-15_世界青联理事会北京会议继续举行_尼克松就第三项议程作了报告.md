Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council meeting in Beijing continued its general session on the afternoon of the 13th, proceeding with discussions on the second agenda item. At the meeting, Malcolm Nixon, Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, delivered a report on the third agenda item of the meeting, titled: On Preparing for the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship.

The afternoon session began at 3:40 PM. The full body of representatives first listened to speeches from eighteen representatives from seventeen countries regarding the second agenda item of the meeting. These countries and representatives were: Ilyas, observer from Pakistan; Monte Dinu, representative from Romania; Babacar Bâ, representative from Senegal; Otto Cesar Vargas, representative from Argentina; Jeanne Vautier-Morissette, representative from France; Mariano T.

In their speeches, the representatives of various countries unanimously supported the report made by Jacques Denis, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, on the second agenda item of the meeting. They unanimously supported the convening of the International Rural Youth Conference. The speeches of these country representatives were received with extremely warm welcome.

After the speeches by the country representatives, prolonged applause echoed in the hall, and all the representatives warmly welcomed Malcolm Nixon, Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, to give a report to the assembly on the third agenda item, titled: On Preparing for the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship.

Nixon said that exactly seven years ago, in 1947, in the years shortly after the Anti-Fascist World War, the first World Youth Festival was held. Today, young people see more and more clearly that the struggle for peace, national independence and rights, and the unity of youth in the struggle, are a basic condition for striving for a better future. They regard the festival as a great event serving these purposes. They recognize that the work of preparing the festival is inseparable from the pressing issues they care about, that is, the issues that inspire young people in every country and every industry to engage in struggle. The successive festivals organized by the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students have attracted young people from all walks of life into the preparatory work, making them more active in the struggle to maintain peace, strive for national independence, and defend economic and social rights. The previous festivals have shown the brilliant achievements of young people's united struggle, one session surpassing the previous one.

Nixon said that now, we are very pleased to announce on behalf of the Executive Committee that our Secretariat and the Executive Committee have received a kind and enthusiastic invitation from the Polish Youth Union to hold the next festival in their country. We are also very pleased to recommend that the Council accept this solemn invitation. The Fifth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship will be held at the end of July 1955 in Warsaw, the capital of the People's Republic of Poland, a magnificent heroic city.

After Nixon gave a detailed account of the powerful contributions that previous festivals have made to the general movement and to the struggle for peace, friendship, and peaceful coexistence among nations, he said that the characteristic of the Fifth Festival is that it will make a fundamental contribution to the cause of peace and international friendship. Therefore, we can proudly call the Fifth Festival the "Fifth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship." This festival should be a great festival of friendship, an unprecedented gathering of young people with the most representative tendencies, where they will show and express their desire and will to strive for peace and friendship among all countries in the world. Now we are organizing the Fifth Festival in the same way as we have organized several previous festivals and other international gatherings, and we take this opportunity to sincerely and earnestly invite other international organizations to prepare for and participate in this festival. We firmly believe that youth organizations will each occupy a place in the festival for their own benefit and for the benefit of the entire young generation.

Nixon said that the festival program is a great event in the life of young people. This embodies the feelings and desires of young people. This is an exhibition of the best cultural heritage of various countries, and it is the focus of the preparatory work for the festival. When we talk about the preparation for the festival, we always think of preparing some attractive programs that should show the interests and demands of young people, and should fully reflect the purpose of our festival. Nixon then submitted a draft program for the Fifth Festival to this Council meeting for discussion.

Speaking of preparatory work, Nixon said that the task of our member organizations in the preparatory work is to ensure the best results, and one of the most important things is to organize national, urban, rural, factory, and school preparatory committees. Local committees can greatly strengthen grassroots work. The preparatory committee can become a center of unified action, a center for cooperation among various youth organizations around the main goals of the festival. Each preparatory committee should unite the most diverse groups around itself. We should attract representatives of youth organizations with the most diverse natures, the best representatives of cultural, recreational and sports activities, the most respected trade union leaders, as well as scientists, writers, artists, dancers, actors, and all well-known people in our own country.

Nixon said that in order to ensure the success of the festival, the members of the International Preparatory Committee should be the best. In this committee, all activities related to youth and related to many countries will be represented, so the establishment of this committee is an important task in the preparation of the festival. We propose that the first meeting of the International Preparatory Committee for the festival be held in Warsaw in December this year. This is necessary to ensure that the festival movement is carried out within a certain period. We must make the greatest efforts in a relatively short period of time, mobilize all forces, and make the first meeting of the preparatory committee a success.

Nixon finally said that we should make full use of all the good opportunities of the Beijing meeting of the Council to lay the most solid, broadest and best foundation for the Fifth Festival. Only through this way can we achieve the established goals. In this way, we will be able to move vigorously together with hundreds of millions of young people around the world towards the victory of the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship in 1955.

At the end of Nixon's report, thunderous applause rang out in the hall for a long time.

    尼克松就第三项议程作了报告
    【新华社十三日讯】世界民主青年联盟理事会北京会议十三日下午继续举行大会，进行关于会议第二项议程的讨论。会上，并由世界民主青年联盟书记马尔科姆·尼克松作了关于会议第三项议程的报告，题目是：关于筹备第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节。
    下午的会议在三时四十分开始。全体代表首先听取了十七个国家的十八位代表关于会议第二项议程的发言。这些发言的国家和代表是：巴基斯坦列席代表伊利亚斯、罗马尼亚代表蒙特·丁努、塞内加尔代表巴巴卡尔·班居、阿根廷代表奥托·塞撒·瓦加斯、法国代表让娜·范伍特·莫里塞特、厄瓜多尔列席代表马里亚诺·特·阿尔瓦雷斯、丹麦代表格纳·克里斯坦逊、苏联代表尼·卡·基里钦科、黎巴嫩代表阿卜杜勒—卡德尔·穆罕默德·维德·巴哈什、法国列席代表埃伯哈德·保罗亨利·加布里尔、马提尼克代表奥古斯特·弗伦、匈牙利代表埃·霍洛斯、墨西哥特邀代表阿图罗·奥朗奈、挪威列席代表维加德·斯勒登、冰岛代表托罗尔弗·丹尼尔逊、德国代表玛丽雅·贝尔格、委内瑞拉代表卡洛斯·斐尔特斯和印度代表等。各国代表在发言中，一致拥护世界民主青年联盟总书记雅克·德尼所作的关于会议第三项议程的报告。一致拥护召开国际农村青年大会。这些国家代表的发言都受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    各国代表发言后，会场上响起了经久不息的掌声，全体代表热情欢迎世界民主青年联盟书记马尔科姆·尼克松向大会作第三项议程的报告，题目是：关于筹备第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节。
    尼克松说，整整七年以前，在一九四七年，即反法西斯世界大战结束后不久的年代中，举行了第一届世界青年联欢节。今天青年们越来越清楚地看到，争取和平、民族独立与权利的斗争，以及青年在斗争中的团结，是争取美好前途的一个基本条件。他们把联欢节当作为这些目的服务的一个伟大事件。他们认识到，筹备联欢节的工作，是与他们所关心的切身问题，即鼓舞着每一个国家每一个行业的青年从事斗争的问题分不开的。世界民主青年联盟与国际学生联合会所组织的历届联欢节，把极不相同的各界青年吸引到筹备工作中来，使他们在为维护和平、争取民族独立、保卫经济和社会权利的斗争中，更加积极起来。以往的联欢节一届比一届更显示了青年的团结一致的斗争的辉煌成就。
    尼克松说，现在，我们非常高兴地代表执行委员会宣布：我们书记处和执行委员会已经接到波兰青年联盟关于在他们国家举行下一届联欢节的盛意的热情的邀请。我们并非常高兴地建议理事会接受这个庄严的邀请。第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节将于一九五五年七月底在波兰人民共和国的首都、壮丽的英雄城市华沙举行。
    尼克松在详细的叙述了历届联欢节对于一般的运动，对于争取和平、友谊与各国和平共处的斗争所作的有力贡献以后说，第五届联欢节的特点是它对于和平事业和国际友谊将有基本的贡献。因此我们可以自豪地把第五届联欢节叫做“第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节”。这届联欢节应该成为友谊的伟大节日，成为各种最有代表性的倾向的青年的空前联欢会，届时他们将要显示出并表达出他们争取全世界各国和平友好的愿望和意志。现在我们像过去我们已经组织的几届联欢节和其他国际性的集会一样来组织第五届联欢节，我们并且借此机会衷心地诚恳地邀请其他国际组织筹备和参加这一届联欢节。我们深信，各青年组织为了自己的利益以及为了整个青年一代的利益，将在联欢节中各占一席。
    尼克松说，联欢节的节目是青年生活中一个伟大的事件。这体现着青年的感情和愿望。这是各国最优良文化遗产的展览，是联欢节筹备工作中的焦点。当我们谈起联欢节的筹备工作时，总是想到准备一些吸引人的节目，这些节目应该显示出青年的兴趣和要求，并应充分反映出我们联欢节的目的。尼克松接着把关于第五届联欢节的节目草案提交这次理事会会议讨论。
    谈到筹备工作，尼克松说，我们的会员组织在筹备工作中的任务，是保证获得最好的结果，其中最重要的事项之一，是组织全国性的、城市的、乡村的、工厂的、学校的筹备委员会。地方性的委员会可以大大地加强基层工作。筹备委员会可以成为统一行动的中心，成为围绕联欢节的主要目标的各种青年组织的合作的中心。各筹备委员会应当把极不相同的各种团体团结到自己的周围。我们应当在自己国内把性质最不相同的青年组织的代表人物、文娱体育的最优秀的代表人物、最受尊敬的工会领导人物以及科学家、作家、艺术家、舞蹈家、演员、一切很知名的人物都吸引过来。
    尼克松说，为了保证联欢节的成功，国际筹备委员会的组成人员应当是最优秀的。在这个委员会里面，将表现出与青年有关，与许多国家有关的一切活动，因此成立这个委员会，是联欢节筹备工作中一个重要的任务。我们建议今年十二月在华沙召开联欢节国际筹备委员会第一次会议。为了保证在一定时期开展联欢节的运动，这样做是必要的。我们必须在相当短的时间内作最大努力，动员一切力量，把筹备会第一次会议开好。
    尼克松最后说，我们应该充分利用理事会北京会议的一切良好的机会，为第五届联欢节打下最巩固、最广泛、最良好的基础。只有经过这一途径，我们才能达到既定的目标。这样，我们就能够和全世界千百万青年共同朝气蓬勃地向着一九五五年第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节胜利前进。
    尼克松报告结束时，会场上掌声雷动，经久不息。
