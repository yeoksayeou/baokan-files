Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: The Beijing meeting of the Council of the World Federation of Democratic Youth continued its plenary session on the morning of the tenth, and conducted group discussions in the afternoon.

Today, 213 youth representatives, observers, and guests attended the conference. Representatives from 13 countries spoke at the meeting.

Those who spoke at the morning session expressed their support for Benini's report; they unanimously agreed that opposing the US's policies of aggression and war and striving "for peace, national independence, and a bright future for youth" represents the wishes of all youth in colonial and dependent countries.

When the chairman announced the invitation to the representative of the Vietnamese delegation, which had achieved a historic victory in the anti-colonialist struggle, and to a young hero who had been imprisoned for five years for opposing the Spanish Franco fascist government supported by US imperialism, to speak, the entire audience rose and applauded continuously and warmly when they finished their moving speeches. When the French youth representative presented a baton symbolizing peace, friendship, and unity to the Vietnamese representative (Note: This baton contained a letter from the youth of the Pyrenees Mountains in southern France opposing the colonial war, and was inscribed with the names of Raymond Dien and Henri Martin, French youth peace fighters. During the French National Day this year, French youth held a celebration and the baton was passed from the Pyrenees to Paris), they embraced each other amidst thunderous applause.

During the meeting, the chairman announced a telegram that had just been sent from the Netherlands, stating that Piet van Stuivenberg, a young Dutch soldier who had refused to fight against the Indonesian people and had been sentenced to seven years in prison, had been released. This was a victory for Dutch and Indonesian youth. It is a symbol of the deep friendship between Indonesian and Dutch youth in their common struggle for freedom and independence, for peace, and for a better future for youth. This telegram caused excitement throughout the hall.

The morning session began at 9:15 AM. The first speaker was Sadoon Mustafa, the representative of Algeria. After denouncing the serious disasters caused by colonialism in their country and introducing the youth's anti-colonial struggle, he said that in the struggle, our youth are increasingly united, because we know that unity is strength, and unity is the guarantee of victory.

Next to speak was Ho Truc, the representative of Vietnam. He first expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people and youth for their fraternal assistance and support in the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence! He said:

Today, we are honored to report to you the glorious results of our eight-year struggle for independence and peace. "The Geneva Conference has made a decision to restore peace in Indochina on the basis of respecting the independence, national sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. This is the result of more than eight years of arduous resistance by the people of Indochina with the support of the peace forces of the world. Therefore, this brilliant victory belongs not only to the youth and people of Indochina, but also to the peace-loving youth and people of the world!" On behalf of the Vietnamese youth, he expressed deep gratitude to all the youth, all youth organizations, and the people of all countries who had warmly supported the Vietnamese people's resistance and had contributed to the restoration of peace in Indochina through their efforts. Ho Truc continued: The most precious aspirations of the Vietnamese people and youth have always been peace, independence, and unity. Those who participated in the Geneva Conference recognized these aspirations! France has announced its willingness to withdraw French troops from the three Indochinese countries. The Vietnamese people will conduct democratic and free elections in July 1956 to completely realize national independence and national unity. The results of the Geneva Conference clearly point out that if the people of a country eagerly desire independence and unity, no force can stop them from realizing their lofty and reasonable aspirations. The signing of the Indochina armistice agreement is clear proof that the forces of peace have triumphed over the forces of aggression, and also proves to the people of the world who love peace that they know how to strive for peace, thereby easing international tensions. After the signing of the Korean armistice agreement, the results of the Geneva Conference once again confirmed the following belief to the people of the world: that in the current international relations, there are no disputes that cannot be resolved through negotiation.

Ho Truc concluded by saying that Vietnamese youth will strengthen their friendly and united ties with the youth of Cambodia and Laos, the youth of France, the youth of Southeast Asian countries, and the peace-loving youth of the world, in order to defeat the plans of the warmongers and constantly maintain vigilance in order to strive for the complete realization of the Geneva Accords. Now, while working to consolidate the peace that has been established, Vietnamese youth and people have been able to engage in peaceful construction! We assure you that we will work hard to heal the wounds of war, and we believe that under the wise leadership of our Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and under the guidance of the valuable experience of the youth of the Soviet Union, China, the people's democratic countries, and the youth of the world, we can accomplish this task.

Next, Edgar Ponslet, the representative of Belgium, Hugh Elwyn Skinner, the representative of Trinidad, Edith Kovalivich, the representative of Canada, and David Rabinowici, the representative of Israel, also spoke. They all pointed out that the US imperialists are increasingly interfering in the affairs of other countries and increasingly suppressing the patriotic movements of other countries; US colonialism and war policies threaten the people of all countries and threaten the cause of peace. They said that colonialism must be stopped, war policies must be opposed, and the cause of peace must be defended. The Israeli representative shouted "Long live peace" at the end of his speech. This just call expressed everyone's common desire.

The Italian representative also spoke at the meeting.

The meeting continued after a fifteen-minute break. When the American representative, who was serving as the executive chairman, announced the invitation to Lopez Remondo, a Spanish anti-fascist fighter, to speak, the participants were all pleased that he could attend the meeting.

Next, F. Ericson, the representative of Sweden, Shigeo Suzuki, the Japanese observer, and Ramiro Puig Putter, the representative of Mexico, spoke in succession.

Hu Fengfu, the representative of Pakistan, spoke and pointed out that the people and youth of Pakistan firmly oppose the US-Pakistan military agreement. He said that this agreement seriously affects the security of the Pakistani people and will make the people's lives even poorer. The people and youth of Pakistan have unwavering confidence in the future of their motherland, until imperialism is driven out of the country, just like the great victories achieved by the great Chinese people, the Korean people, and the Vietnamese people.

After the executive chairman introduced Li Dequan, a guest attending the meeting and the representative of the International Democratic Women's Federation, Li Dequan went to the stage amidst warm applause to congratulate the meeting. She said that because our cause is common and our goals are consistent, I believe that all the resolutions and initiatives of the Beijing meeting of the Council of the World Federation of Democratic Youth will receive the active support of the International Democratic Women's Federation and its member organizations in various countries, as well as the broad masses of peace-loving women. She pointed out that the international situation has undergone fundamental changes, which are more conducive to the struggle of the people of colonial and dependent countries for national independence; the victory of the Chinese people's revolution marks the end of the era in which colonialists could do whatever they wanted. The people of colonial and dependent countries have the right to decide their own destiny, and they must obtain peace, democracy, national independence, and freedom! Finally, she said, let us unite more widely and closely, and strive for the collective security and peace of the people of the world, for further easing of international tensions, against the threat of war, against national enslavement, and for a better and happier life for all mankind! As long as we unite under this great goal, regardless of ethnicity or race, regardless of class, regardless of political and religious beliefs, regardless of gender, the final victory will be guaranteed!

The last speaker at the morning session was Otto Cesar Vargas, the representative of Argentina. He said that the youth of Argentina demand freedom and independence for their motherland, and demand to live a happy and beautiful life. For this purpose, they are waging an unyielding struggle.

The meeting was divided into two groups for discussion in the afternoon.

    世界青联理事会北京会议进行大会发言
    各国代表反对美国侵略政策和战争政策
   【新华社十日讯】世界民主青年联盟理事会北京会议十日上午继续进行大会发言，午后进行分组讨论。
    今天参加大会的青年代表、列席观察员和来宾有二百一十三人，在会上发言的有十三个国家的代表。
    在上午会议上发言的人们都表示拥护柏尼尼所作的报告；他们一致认为反对美国的侵略政策和战争政策，来“为和平、民族独立和争取青年美好未来而奋斗”是代表了一切殖民地附属国青年的愿望。
    当主席宣布邀请在反殖民主义斗争中取得历史性胜利的越南代表团代表和因反对在美帝国主义支持下的西班牙弗朗哥法西斯政府因而被监禁了五年的青年勇士先后发言，和当他们结束动人的发言时，全场起立，作持续而又热烈的鼓掌。当法国青年代表将一支象征着和平友谊团结的接力棒赠送给越南代表时，（按：这支接力棒中曾装有一封法国南部比利牛斯山中青年们的一封反对殖民战争的信件，棒上刻有法国青年和平战士雷蒙德·第安和亨利·马丁的名字，在今年法国的国庆节时，法国青年举行联欢，这支接力棒由比利牛斯山传至巴黎）他们在雷动掌声中互相拥抱。
    大会主席在会议进行中宣布了一份刚自荷兰拍来的电报，电报里说，一个拒绝向印度尼西亚人民作战的荷兰青年士兵被判处七年徒刑的派提·万·斯妥维尔已经获得自由，这是荷兰与印尼青年的一次胜利。它是在印尼与荷兰青年争取自由和独立、争取和平和青年美好的将来的共同斗争中的深厚友谊的象征。这封电报引起全场振奋。
    上午的会议在九点十五分开始，首先发言的是阿尔及利亚代表萨敦·穆斯塔法。他在控诉了殖民主义者造成他们国家严重灾难和介绍青年进行反殖民主义斗争后说，在斗争中我们的青年日益团结起来，因为我们知道，团结就是力量，团结是胜利的保证。
    接着是越南代表胡竹发言，他首先向给予越南人民民族独立斗争以兄弟般援助和支持的中国人民和青年表示感谢！他说：
    今天，我们很荣幸地来向你们报告我们争取独立与和平的八年斗争的光荣的成果。“日内瓦会议已经作出决定，在尊重越南、高棉、寮国三国的独立、国家主权、统一与领土完整的基础上，恢复印度支那的和平。这是印度支那人民在全世界和平力量的支持下，经过八年多的艰苦抗战所获得的结果。所以，这一辉煌胜利，不但属于印度支那的青年和人民，而且也属于全世界爱好和平的青年和人民！”他代表越南青年对曾经给越南人民抗战以热烈支持、曾经以他们的努力，为恢复印度支那的和平作出贡献的所有的青年，一切青年组织，以及各国人民，表示深厚的谢意。胡竹接着说：越南人民和青年最珍贵的愿望始终是和平、独立和统一。参加日内瓦会议的人士承认了这些愿望！法国已经宣布愿意从三个印度支那国家中撤出法国军队。越南人民将要在一九五六年七月进行民主自由的选举，以彻底实现民族独立和国家统一。日内瓦会议的结果明显地指出了：一个国家的人民如果热切地盼望得到独立和统一，就没有任何力量可以阻止他们实现其崇高的合理的愿望。印度支那停战协定的签订，是和平力量战胜侵略势力的明证，同时也证明了全世界爱好和平的人民知道怎样力争和平，从而缓和国际紧张局势。在朝鲜停战协定签订以后，日内瓦会议的结果再一次向全世界人民证实了下面的信念：在目前国际关系中，没有任何争端不能够通过协商来解决。
    胡竹最后说，越南青年加强他们与高棉和寮国青年、法国青年、东南亚各国青年以及全世界爱好和平的青年的友谊和团结联系，以击败战争贩子的计划并为争取日内瓦协定的彻底实现而不断地保持警惕。现在越南青年和人民在为巩固已建立的和平而努力的同时，已经可能从事和平建设了！我们向你们保证，要努力医治战争的创伤，我们相信，在我们的主席胡志明的英明领导下，在苏联、中国、人民民主国家青年以及全世界青年的宝贵经验的指导下，我们是可以完成这一工作的。
    接着，比利时代表爱德加·庞斯莱、特立尼达代表休·艾尔温·斯金纳、加拿大代表伊迪思·科瓦利韦奇、以色列代表戴维·拉比诺维西也相继发言。他们都指出，美帝国主义者越来越多地干涉别国人民的事务，越来越多地镇压别国人民的爱国运动；美国殖民主义和战争政策威胁着所有国家的人民，威胁着和平事业。他们说，殖民主义必须制止，战争政策必须反对，和平事业必须保卫。以色列代表在结束他的发言时，大声高呼“和平万岁”。这个正义呼声正表达了大家的共同愿望。
    意大利代表也在会上发了言。
    会议在休息十五分钟后继续进行。担任执行主席的美国代表宣布请西班牙的反法西斯战士洛佩兹·雷蒙多发言时，与会者都为他能出席会议而庆贺。
    接着，瑞典代表弗·埃里克逊、日本列席代表铃木重郎、墨西哥代表拉米罗·普奇·普特都相继发言。
    巴基斯坦代表胡丰福发言，他指出，巴基斯坦人民和青年坚决反对美巴军事协定，他说，这个协定严重地影响巴基斯坦人民的安全，使人民的生活将更加贫困。巴基斯坦的人民和青年有着对祖国未来的不可动摇的信心，直到把帝国主义赶出国境为止，就像伟大的中国人民、朝鲜人民和越南人民所取得的伟大胜利那样。
    执行主席向大会介绍了出席会议的来宾、国际民主妇女联合会代表李德全后，李德全在热烈掌声中上台向会议致词祝贺。她说，由于我们的事业是共同的，目标是一致的，因此，我相信世界民主青年联盟理事会北京会议的一切决议和倡议，将获得国际民主妇联及其各国会员团体，以及广大的爱好和平的妇女们的积极支持。她指出，世界局势已经起了根本的变化，更加有利于殖民地、附属国人民争取民族独立的斗争；中国人民革命的胜利，标志着殖民者可以任意为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了。殖民地、附属国的人民有权自己决定自己的命运，他们必须获得和平、民主、民族独立与自由！最后，她说，让我们更广泛更紧密地团结起来，为了全世界人民的集体安全与和平，为了进一步地缓和国际紧张局势，反对战争威胁，反对民族奴役，争取全人类的美好的幸福的生活而奋斗吧！只要我们在这一伟大目标下不分民族与种族、不分阶层、不分政治与宗教信仰、不分男女地团结起来，最后的胜利就有了可靠的保证！
    在上午的会议上，最后发言的是阿根廷代表奥托·塞撒·瓦加斯。他说，阿根廷的青年们要求自己祖国的自由、独立，要求能过幸福、美好的生活，为了这一目的，他们正在作着不屈的斗争。
    会议在下午分两个小组进行讨论。
