The Motherland's Concern for Returned Overseas Chinese Students
Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Students Supplementary School, Chen Huilian

    I read the draft constitution word by word, and my heart was filled with joy. I am a returned overseas Chinese student from Vietnam. When I returned to the motherland and personally received the education and cultivation of the motherland, I naturally recalled the various persecutions suffered by overseas Chinese students abroad.

    In May 1950, at the Fujian Middle School, a Chinese school in Dike (French-occupied area) in Vietnam, after the principal whom the students loved was deported, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents took control of the school and then attempted to gradually shut down the entire Fujian Middle School from the high school department to the junior high school department. At that time, in order to study, the students successively requested the school to resume classes. Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents colluded with the local colonial authorities and arrested nearly a hundred students on the charge of "attempting to demonstrate." They押送（yesong）these students to the police station, where secret agents forced them to kneel on the gravel in the hot sun until their knees bled, carrying out two hours of collective humiliation and punishment. Then the French police chief named them one by one according to the blacklist drawn up by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents. Regardless of whether they were male or female students, those who were "named" were first brutally beaten with fists and whips, and then subjected to water torture or electric shocks. Some students' eyes bled, some were beaten half to death, and some fainted five or six times from electric shocks. Among them, eight students were identified by the Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents who controlled the school, and they suffered even more cruel torture. I remember that at about 1:00 PM on May 12, 1950, Chen Peiji, a seventeen-year-old female student of excellent character and learning who was about to graduate from junior high school, was taken out for interrogation. She was tortured for an hour with a whip dipped in hot oil. She was covered in blisters and unable to move. When she was pushed back to the dark room, she didn't even have the strength to groan or shout. That afternoon, the police station sent the critically ill Chen Peiji to the so-called "public hospital," and that night, they operated on her and cut out her intestines. Chen died just like that. After poisoning Chen, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents and the local government, in order to cover up their crimes, even denied it, saying that she "committed suicide by taking poison," and forced her father to secretly bury the body. We still vividly remember this bloody fact today. This is just one example of how overseas Chinese students, out of their love for the motherland and their desire to study, were murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents who were fleeing abroad.

    After I left Dike, Vietnam, and returned to China, those dark years ended. A new life began in the motherland. The motherland has created good learning and working conditions for the younger generation, so that we returned overseas Chinese students, like domestic youth, have broad prospects.

    Due to the social environment abroad, overseas Chinese students cannot completely catch up with the level of domestic students in terms of curriculum, and the time of returning to China varies. These are the difficulties we encounter after returning to China. However, in order to help us apply for regular schools and solve our learning and living difficulties before enrollment, the motherland has established overseas Chinese student supplementary schools in Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Beijing, so that we can lay a foundation in the curriculum, improve our level, and prepare for the entrance examinations of regular schools through supplementary study. As the draft constitution stipulates, the state establishes and gradually expands various schools and other cultural and educational institutions to guarantee citizens' right to education, and it also stipulates that "the state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people." When I saw these provisions in the draft constitution, I deeply felt how happy, glorious, and proud it is to be a young person growing up in the Mao Zedong era!

    During the discussion of the draft constitution, I, like other newly returned overseas Chinese students, assured the motherland: we will actively strive to keep up with the ranks of domestic youth and move forward together. Before entering a regular school, I will work hard to make up for the courses in a realistic manner, and improve my cultural knowledge level one step further on the existing basis; in life, I will abide by the school's living system, work hard to exercise, and at the same time learn the domestic students' style of hard work and plain living; after being admitted to the entrance examination, I will resolutely obey the national education construction plan and obey the enrollment assignment. I am determined to work with other returned overseas Chinese students to repay the country's love and care for us with practical actions of "good health, good study, and good work," and will never fail the country's cultivation and expectations of us.

    祖国对归国华侨学生的关怀
    北京归国华侨学生中等补习学校　陈蕙莲
    我一字一句地阅读了宪法草案，内心充满着喜悦。我是一个来自越南的归国华侨学生，当我回到祖国，亲身受到祖国的教育和培养的时候，很自然的就会回忆起华侨同学在国外时身受的种种迫害。
    在一九五○年五月，越南堤岸（法占区）一所华侨学校——福建中学，同学们爱戴的校长被驱逐出境之后，蒋匪特务把持了学校，接着又企图一步一步地从高中部到初中部把福建中学全校停办。当时同学们为了要读书，先后向学校提出复课要求。蒋匪特务就勾结当地殖民当局，以“企图示威”的罪名，先逮捕了近百名同学。他们把这些同学押到警局，特务强迫同学们在炎热的太阳光下跪在沙石地上，直跪到膝部流血，进行了两个小时的集体侮辱和刑罚。接着法国警长就按照蒋匪特务开列的黑名单一一点名，不论是男同学、女同学，被“点”到名的都被先用拳头、鞭子毒打一顿，随即被灌水或受电刑。同学们有的眼睛出了血，有的被打得死去活来，有的受电刑昏去五六次。其中有八名同学，是把持学校的蒋匪特务亲到警局指认的，遭刑更为残酷。记得是在一九五○年五月十二日的下午一时左右，这八名同学之一，品学兼优、将要初中毕业的十七岁女生陈佩姬被提出拷问，被用浸过热油的鞭子拷打一小时，她通身起泡不能行动，在被推回暗房时，连呻吟叫喊都无力了。当天下午，警局把垂危的陈佩姬送入所谓“公立医院”，当晚就开刀割出肠脏，陈同学就这样离开我们了。蒋匪特务和当地政府毒害了陈同学以后，为掩盖他们的罪行，竟抵赖说她是“服毒自杀”的，并强迫她的父亲偷偷地把尸体埋葬。这一血淋淋的事实，我们今天记忆犹新。这只是华侨同学热爱祖国，要求学习，而遭到流窜在国外的蒋匪特务借刀杀人的一例而已。
    我离开越南堤岸回国以后，那阴暗的岁月结束了。在祖国开始了新的生活。祖国为青年一代创造了良好的学习和工作条件，使我们归国华侨同学和国内青年一样有着广阔的前程。
    由于国外的社会环境，华侨同学在课程上不能完全赶上国内同学的水平，回国的时间又有先有后，这就是我们回国之后遇到的困难。但是，祖国为了帮助我们投考正规学校，解决我们在入学前学习上、生活上的困难，在厦门、广州、北京建立了华侨学生中等补习学校，使我们通过补习，在课程上打下基础，提高水平，准备参加正规学校的考试。正如宪法草案上规定，国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，以保证公民享有受教育的权利，又规定了“国家特别关怀青年的体力和智力的发展”。当看到宪法草案上这些条文，我深深地感到生长在毛泽东时代的青年是多么幸福、光荣和值得骄傲！
    在讨论宪法草案的时候，我和其他新回国的华侨同学一样，向祖国提出保证：我们要积极努力跟上国内青年的队伍一道前进。在未进正规学校之前，我将以实事求是的态度，努力补习各科课程，在现有的基础上把文化知识水平提高一步；在生活上，遵守学校的生活制度，努力锻炼身体，同时学习国内同学艰苦朴素的作风；投考被录取后，坚决服从国家教育建设计划，服从入学分配。我决心和其他归国华侨同学共同以“身体好、学习好、工作好”的实际行动，答谢国家对我们的爱护和关怀，决不辜负国家对我们的培植和期望。
