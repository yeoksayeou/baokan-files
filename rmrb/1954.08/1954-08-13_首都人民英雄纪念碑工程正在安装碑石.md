The construction of the People's Heroes Monument in the capital is currently installing the stones for the monument. By the end of July, the eight layers of the pedestal's stone materials had been installed. The processing of the stone materials for the monument's body, core, and inscription is now underway, and installation will begin shortly. The white marble being mined in Fangshan County, Hebei Province, to supply the stone materials for the monument's reliefs, balustrades, and pillars has been verified by geologists to be pure in color and fine in texture, resistant to weathering, and durable for 800 to 1,000 years. It is expected that most of this mining project will be completed within the year.

The workers, experts, and cadres working at the construction site of the People's Heroes Monument in the capital have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. In the past two years, 80% of the workers have received awards. During the labor emulation campaign in June and July this year, many stonemason groups exceeded the new labor quotas and ensured the quality of the project. After discussing the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the staff became even more aware that the monument project is a great, glorious, and arduous task. Li Shanliang, deputy leader of the construction team, and engineer Hua Kezhuan both stated: "The draft Constitution records the fruits of the revolutionary struggle in legal form, and the monument we are building praises the achievements of the revolutionary martyrs with buildings, so that they will be immortal. Therefore, there can be no errors in any stone, any edge, or any mortar joint."

Since its groundbreaking in 1949, the construction of the People's Heroes Monument in the capital has brought together outstanding workers and technical personnel from across the country to carry out intensive preparation and design work. Construction began on August 1, 1952. After the start of construction, the Construction Committee of the People's Heroes Monument in the capital sent the design progress and photo patterns of the previous stage to the relevant departments of architecture, art and literature across the country in order to build the monument better, and also held an exhibition in Beijing to solicit opinions widely, receiving two or three hundred kinds of monument patterns and written opinions, which were of great reference value. At present, the shape of the monument's body has been initially determined, and the shape of the top of the monument and the subject matter of the reliefs are still being studied and solicited.

    首都人民英雄纪念碑工程正在安装碑石
    首都人民英雄纪念碑的兴建工程正在安装碑石。七月底，八层碑座石料已经安装完毕，现正进行碑身、碑心和碑文石料的加工，不日就可开始安装。在河北省房山县为供应纪念碑的浮雕、栏板和栏柱等石料的需要而开采的汉白玉，已经地质学家化验证明色纯质细，不易风化，能耐用八百年到一千年。预计这一开采工程年内就可以大部完工。
　　在首都人民英雄纪念碑工地工作的工人、专家和干部，都发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。两年来，百分之八十的工人受到了奖励。在今年六、七月间开展的劳动竞赛中，许多石工小组都超过了新的劳动定额，并保证了工程质量。职工们在讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案以后，更加认识到纪念碑工程是一个伟大、光荣而又艰巨的任务。施工组副组长李善樑和工程师华克专都表示：宪法草案是用法律形式记载了革命斗争的果实，我们兴建的纪念碑是用建筑物来歌颂革命先烈们的功绩，让他们永垂不朽。因此，无论是一块石料、一个棱角、一条灰缝，都不能有差错。
　　首都人民英雄纪念碑工程自一九四九年奠基以来，集中了全国优秀的工人和技术人材，进行紧张的筹备和设计工作，在一九五二年八月一日开工。开工后，首都人民英雄纪念碑兴建委员会为了把纪念碑建造得更好，将前一阶段的设计经过和图案照片寄发给全国建筑、美术和文艺等有关部门，并曾在北京举办展览会，广泛征求意见，收到碑型图案和文字意见二、三百种，很有参考价值。目前，碑身造型已经初步确定，碑顶造型、浮雕题材还在继续研究和征求意见中。　（新华社）
