Broad masses of people enthusiastically discuss the draft constitution

    The Voice of All the People of Shaanxi
    Zheng Dong
    On August 11th, the "Mass Hall" was filled with joy. All the representatives attending the first session of the First People's Congress of Shaanxi Province enthusiastically discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. A total of thirty representatives spoke at the meeting. They expressed their understanding and feelings about the draft constitution from various aspects, and represented the representatives of various groups in expressing their ardent support for the first people's constitution draft in the history of our country.
    Wang Sulan, a people's representative and female worker at the BaoHui Match Factory in Ningqiang County, walked onto the podium, and her first sentence moved everyone in the audience. She said:
    "Today I am especially happy, happy that I have become the master of the country." The feeling of happiness before her made her even more indignant at the painful experiences of the past. She said: "I started working in the match factory with my mother when I was eight years old. One day's wages were not enough for one person to live on, and we were often beaten by the capitalists. At that time, many workers had scars on their bodies. In 1947, the capitalists did not pay wages for two months, and the workers had to find some wild vegetables to fill their stomachs every day. My mother was arrested by the pseudo-police for representing the workers to demand wages from the capitalists. I ran to negotiate, and the capitalists said I was a Communist Party member and locked me up as well. Later, the workers supported us with a strike, and the capitalists ordered the pseudo-police to release us. In 1948, my mother died of illness. Three days after her death, my elderly grandmother also died. At that time, my father had been conscripted into the army by the Kuomintang reactionaries. My family only had me, a seventeen-year-old girl. How could I not be sad when two people died in three days? I cried all day long and ruined one of my eyes. The capitalists used this as an excuse to fire me from the factory." As she spoke, the audience couldn't help but focus their attention on her eye that had lost its sight. Seeing the sympathetic eyes of the audience watching her, she said excitedly: "In 1949, southern Shaanxi was liberated. The People's Government established a workers' resumption committee, and I returned to the factory. In the past, I was fired by the capitalists, but now I have returned to the factory as its master. In the past, the capitalists said I was a Communist Party member and locked me up, but now I have truly become a glorious Communist Party member, and the people have elected me as a people's representative. How can I not be grateful for the leadership of the Communist Party? In the future, I will definitely maintain close ties with the masses, work hard in production, and abide by the constitution in an exemplary manner, dedicating all my energy to the cause of socialism."
    People's Representative Zhang Mingliang, an agricultural labor model, believes that the promulgation of the draft constitution is a great happy event for the people. He expressed his desire to unite with the workers and protect the fruits of the people's revolution. He also recalled his past tragic history: he worked as a farmhand in the landlord's house for eighteen years before liberation. His family lived in a dilapidated temple, his mother lived by begging, and his father had nothing when he died. He borrowed a mat from someone to bury his father. He said: "Only after the Communist Party came did I truly see the light of day. We were allocated land and organized to produce, and each and every one of us changed from poor to rich." After briefly narrating the process of his leadership in developing agricultural production through mutual aid and cooperation organizations, he said: "The draft constitution stipulates that the state should eliminate poverty and exploitation and build a prosperous and happy socialist society through peaceful means. The worker elder brothers are leading the country to develop industry and realize the country's socialist industrialization, and they are also leading us farmers to carry out socialist transformation. Our farmers must take the road of mutual aid and cooperation."
    Every representative's mood was excited.
    People's Representative Fu Mengwu, a model family member of a revolutionary soldier, said excitedly: "The draft constitution expresses the wishes of the working people. In the past, most of the grain that we farmers produced was paid in exorbitant taxes. The Kuomintang reactionaries and the big and small bullies could do whatever they wanted, and no one dared to say a word. Now, we farmers, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have become people's representatives to manage the affairs of the country. How can we not love this people's constitution draft!" He talked about his experience of being persecuted by the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation, and quoted Article 103 of the draft constitution, "It is the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China to defend the motherland. It is the honorable obligation of citizens of the People's Republic of China to perform military service in accordance with the law," and said: "The people's country must be defended by the people. I have eight sons and four daughters-in-law, and seven of them have joined the army." Before his words could land, warm applause rang out throughout the venue. He continued:
    "People call my family a 'glorious family.' We receive many preferential treatments from the People's Government and the masses during festivals. I was also selected as a provincial-level model family member of a revolutionary soldier. Last April, I went to the People's Liberation Army to see my fourth son. At the Baoji Railway Station, people saw that I was a model family member of a revolutionary soldier and immediately asked me to line up with the People's Liberation Army to buy tickets. I felt very honored." The words of this glorious model family member of a revolutionary soldier won continuous applause from the audience.
    People's Representative Wang Zhenhua, Deputy Director of Academic Affairs of Northwest Agricultural College, has worked at Northwest Agricultural College for nearly twenty years. The stark contrast between before and after liberation made him deeply feel the provisions of the draft constitution regarding the basic rights and obligations of citizens, especially the provisions of Article 95 of the draft constitution. He said: "I have worked at Northwest Agricultural College for nearly twenty years. Before liberation, it was labor, and after liberation, it is still labor, but labor after liberation has become a glorious thing." He said with deep emotion: "In that old society, I was nominally a university professor, but because the reactionaries did not care about science and education at all, and because of the threat to life, no one could truly work. Some professors sold their favorite books to people to wrap peanuts in order to maintain their lives. My family only had three people, but I still couldn't afford to raise my child. For the survival of my child, I and others jointly raised a sheep, and I had to take the time to graze the sheep myself. At that time, someone ridiculed us like this: 'The more you professors teach, the thinner you get.' You can imagine how poor we were." Then, Wang Zhenhua excitedly talked about the development of Northwest Agricultural College after liberation. He said: "In the past five years, the new teaching equipment added to Northwest Agricultural College is equal to ten times that of the fifteen years before liberation. From this point, we can see how much the People's Government values the people's science and education." He also talked about the specific example of the successful cultivation of the "Bima No. 1" wheat variety by Northwest Agricultural College after liberation, proving that the People's Government had already done what the draft constitution stipulated regarding the state encouraging scientific workers to engage in creative labor. Wang Zhenhua expressed that he would abide by the constitution in an exemplary manner in the future and make the greatest efforts to cultivate more agricultural science and technology talents for the motherland who meet the requirements of the country.
    "Only male prefectures, no female counties," this old saying left over from the old society that belittled women has lost its realistic basis in New China. People's Representative Feng Shiguang, the female county head of Jingyang County, used the fact that she enjoyed the same political rights as men to explain the reasons why women especially support the draft constitution. Feng Shiguang said: "In the old society, women had no status at all. In the family and in society, anyone could oppress and discriminate against women. In the old society, some people described women as 'whipping cats.' They said that if women were not beaten for three days, they would 'go to the roof and tear off the tiles.' In order to fight for women's freedom and liberation, I joined the revolution very early. In the old liberated areas, I was very happy to see that women had gained freedom under the leadership of the Communist Party. Now that women across the country have been liberated, and the draft constitution stipulates that women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects, how can I not be happy! In the old society, it was impossible to dream of a woman becoming a county head." Finally, Feng Shiguang said that now that the country takes such good care of women, we women must work hard for the people in the socialist construction of the motherland, just like men, so that we can be worthy of being women of New China.
    In a short day, the representatives could not fully express their feelings of supporting the draft constitution. However, we have already heard the voices of the people's representatives, representing the will of the people of Shaanxi Province, cheering for the people's constitution draft. Hidden in this cheering sound is a new force that will promote the rapid advancement of the motherland's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation!

专栏：广大人民热烈讨论宪法草案

    陕西全省人民的声音
    征东
    八月十一日，“群众堂”里喜气洋洋。参加陕西省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议的全体代表，热烈讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案。在大会上发言的共有三十位代表。他们从各方面发表了自己对宪法草案的认识和感想，并且代表了各个小组的代表表达了对于我国有史以来第一部人民宪法草案的拥护热忱。
    人民代表、宁强县保惠火柴厂女工人王素兰走上了讲台，第一句话就感动了全场的人们。她说：
  “今天我特别高兴，高兴的是我做了国家的主人。”眼前幸福的感受，使她对于过去痛苦的遭遇更加激愤。她说：“我八岁就跟母亲到火柴厂做工，一天的工资，不够一个人生活，还要常常受到资本家的毒打。那时，很多工人身上都有伤痕。在一九四七年时，资本家两个月不发工资，工人每天只好找些野菜充饥。我母亲因为代表工人去要求资本家发工资，结果被抓到伪警察局去，我跑去交涉，资本家说我是共产党员，也把我关起来。以后工人用罢工的行动支持我们，资本家才叫伪警察局把我们放出来。一九四八年，我母亲病死了。在她死后第三天，我的年老的祖母也死了。那时，我父亲已被国民党反动派抓去当了兵。一家只有我一个十七岁的女孩子，三天死了两个人，怎能不叫我伤心呢？我一个人成天痛哭，把一只眼睛哭坏了。资本家就借口把我开除出厂。”她讲到这里，全场的视线不由地集中在她那一只已经失去了视觉的眼睛上。她看到全场同情的眼光注视她，随即兴奋地说：“到了一九四九年，陕南解放了。人民政府成立了工人复工委员会，我又回到了工厂。从前我被资本家开除出来，现在我以主人的身份回到了工厂。从前资本家说我是共产党员把我关起来，现在我真正成了一个光荣的共产党员，人民还选我当了人民代表，怎能叫我不感激共产党的领导呢？今后我一定要很好地联系群众，努力生产，模范地遵守宪法，把我的全部精力献给社会主义事业。”
    人民代表、农业劳动模范张明亮认为宪法草案的公布是人民的一件大喜事。他表示要和工人团结在一起，保护人民革命的胜利果实。他也追述了他过去的惨痛历史：解放前在地主家里当了十八年长工，一家住在个破庙里，母亲靠讨饭生活，父亲临死的时候什么都没有，借了人家一条席子才把父亲葬埋了。他说：“共产党来了以后，我才真正见到青天。我们分到了土地，组织起来生产，一个个由穷变富了。”他简要地叙述了他领导互助合作组织发展农业生产的经过后说：“宪法草案规定国家要通过和平的道路，消灭贫困和剥削，建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。工人老大哥领导着全国发展工业，实现国家社会主义工业化，还领导咱们农民实行社会主义改造，咱们农民就是要走互助合作的道路。”
    每个代表的心情都是激动的。
    人民代表、模范军属傅孟五激动地说：“宪法草案写出了劳动人民的心意。从前咱们这些农民打的粮食，大部分缴了苛捐杂税，国民党反动派、大小恶霸要怎样就怎样，谁也不敢说句话。现在还是咱们这些农民，在共产党领导下，却成了人民代表，来管理国家大事。我们怎么能不热爱这个人民宪法草案呢！”他谈了在解放前受国民党反动派迫害的经过，又引述了宪法草案第一百零三条“保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责。依照法律服兵役是中华人民共和国公民的光荣义务。”的条文后说：“人民的国家就要人民保卫。我有八个儿子、四个媳妇，就有七个参军了。”他的话音还没有落地，全场就响起了热烈的掌声。他接着说：
  “人家都叫我家是‘光荣人家’，逢年过节受到人民政府和群众的很多优待，我还被选为全省模范军属。去年四月我到解放军部队去看我的四儿子，在宝鸡火车站上，人家看我是模范军属，随时叫我和解放军排在一起买票，我感到很大的光荣。”这位光荣的模范军属的话，博得全场不住地鼓掌。
    人民代表、西北农学院副教务长王振华，在西北农学院工作了将近二十年。解放前后的鲜明对比，使他对于宪法草案关于公民的基本权利和义务的规定，特别是对宪法草案第九十五条的规定感受很深。他说：“我在西北农学院工作了将近二十年，解放前是劳动，解放后还是劳动，但是解放后劳动才成了光荣的事情。”他感慨万端地说：“在那个旧社会，说起来我是个大学教授，但是由于反动派根本不管什么科学教育，由于生活威胁，谁也不能真正地工作。有的教授为了维持生活把自己最心爱的书籍卖给人家包花生米。我一家只有三口人，但是我还养不起我的孩子，为了我的孩子的生存，我和其他人合养了一只羊，自己还要抽时间去放羊。那时有人这样挖苦我们：‘你们这些教授越教越瘦’，可以想像到我们贫困到什么样子。”接着，王振华兴奋地谈了西北农学院解放后的发展情况。他说：“五年来，西北农学院新添的教学设备，等于解放前十五年的十倍，从这一点就可以看出人民政府如何重视人民的科学教育。”他又谈了解放后西北农学院培育“碧蚂一号”小麦良种成功的具体事例，证明宪法草案中关于国家鼓励科学工作者从事创造性劳动的规定，人民政府早已这样做了。王振华表示今后要模范地遵守宪法，并且以最大的努力为祖国培养更多的合乎国家要求的农业科学技术人材。
    “只有男州没女县”，这句旧社会留下的轻视妇女的话，在新中国已经失去了现实的根据了。人民代表、泾阳县女县长冯世光，用她自己在政治上和男子享有同等的权利的事实，说明妇女对于宪法草案特别拥护的理由。冯世光说：“在旧社会妇女是没有任何地位的。在家庭里，在社会上，什么人都可以压迫和歧视妇女。旧社会有人把妇女说成是‘挨打猫’。说什么妇女‘三天不打，上房揭瓦’。为了争取妇女的自由解放，我很早就参加了革命。过去在老解放区里，看到妇女在共产党领导下获得了自由，心里就感到很高兴。现在全国妇女都获得了解放，宪法草案又规定了妇女在各方面和男子享有同等的权利，怎能不叫我高兴呢！在旧社会里，妇女当县长，做梦也是梦不到的事。”最后，冯世光说，现在国家这样照顾妇女，我们妇女就要和男子一样，在祖国社会主义建设中，努力为人民工作，才能不愧为新中国的妇女。
    在短短的一天时间里，代表们还不能完全地把拥护宪法草案的心情表达出来。但是，我们已经听到代表着陕西全省人民意志的人民代表欢呼人民宪法草案的声音。在这个欢呼的声音里潜藏着一种新的力量，它将推动祖国社会主义工业化、社会主义改造事业的迅速前进！
