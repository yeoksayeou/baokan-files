The China Artists Association, upon receiving a commission from the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations of the State Council of the Central People's Government in February of this year, is preparing six large-scale exhibitions of arts and crafts to be sent on tour to eleven countries in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. The China Artists Association immediately joined with the Central Academy of Fine Arts and other relevant units to organize a "Working Committee for the Overseas Exhibition of Arts and Crafts" to carry out preparatory work, sending people to key areas to directly order goods from artists and production units, and inviting artists to create art design drawings for various handicrafts.

After half a year of intense preparation, more than 10,000 exquisite and beautiful handicrafts have been completed, and have been successively transported to Beijing from various places. A preview was held in the auditorium of the Central Academy of Fine Arts on July 25th and 26th. Those invited to visit included responsible persons from various agencies in the capital and representatives from all walks of life, as well as many foreign guests.

Among the art and craft items for this overseas exhibition, porcelain accounts for the largest proportion, accounting for 30% of all exhibits, including many newly designed porcelain items produced in Jingdezhen. Other ceramic items include those from Shiwan in Guangdong, Dehua in Fujian, Cixian in Hebei, Yixing in Jiangsu, and Yunnan. There are lacquerware from Fuzhou and the Southwest Academy of Art, and carvings of ivory, jadeite, glass, stone, and wood from Beijing, Shanghai, Qingtai and Dongyang in Zhejiang, and Shoushan in Fujian. Also included are woven goods from Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Fujian, embroideries from Changsha, Suzhou, and Beijing, velvet embroideries from Shanghai, drawnwork and netting from Chaozhou and Yantai, inlays from Shandong, brocades from Chengdu and Nanjing, and printed cloth from Hubei and Anhui.

The artists in various regions regarded the production of exhibits for the overseas exhibition as a glorious task, and demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm. For example, Gong Yuzhang, from Zigong, Sichuan, who is famous for weaving delicate bamboo silk fans, is 60 years old. After accepting the task, he worked diligently day and night. The Provincial Department of Culture advised him not to overwork, but he still exceeded his task. Jiang Jiazo, a famous artist from Quanzhou, Fujian, who carves puppets, is over seventy years old and worked despite his illness, and could not be persuaded to stop. After completing their tasks, the flower-making artists in Fuzhou jointly wrote a letter to the China Artists Association saying: "By accepting and completing this glorious task, we have eliminated our previous pessimistic and negative emotions, broken down conservative sectarian ideas, and understood that we must exchange experiences and learn from each other in order to make progress and improve."

The close cooperation between art workers and artists in various regions is also a major factor in the successful completion of this work. Many art cadres went deep into various counties and towns to help artists with design and organize temporary production groups to produce various art and craft items. The Central Academy of Fine Arts also specially organized a working team to work in Jingdezhen for more than three months.

During the preview of the overseas exhibition of arts and crafts, the China Artists Association also invited representatives of artists and cadres engaged in arts and crafts from Jingdezhen, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Shanghai, Shiwan in Guangdong, Cixian in Hebei, and Shandong to Beijing to observe the products of various regions, and held five consecutive symposiums to report on the production and sales of art and craft items in various regions, exchange experiences, and discuss issues such as how to organize production and supply. The Art Service Department, which will soon be established by the China Artists Association, will regularly organize artists to cooperate with artists, and establish production and sales relationships with art and craft production units in various regions. The China Artists Association will also strongly assist the ceramic art research institute and art porcelain factory to be established in Jingdezhen.

After more than ten days of observation and symposiums, the artists and cadres who came to Beijing from various regions have excitedly left Beijing to return to their homes. They stated that after returning, they would transform the temporary production groups into permanent production cooperatives, and further reform, develop, and improve the quantity and quality of various art and craft items to meet the growing needs at home and abroad.

    中国美术家协会等单位筹办出国工艺美展
    中国美术家协会于今年二月间，接受中央人民政府政务院对外文化联络事务局的委托，筹办六个大规模的美术工艺品展览，分送苏联、东欧和东南亚十一个国家去流动展览。中国美术家协会当即会同中央美术学院和其他有关单位，组织了“出国工艺美展工作委员会”，进行筹备工作，派人分赴各重点地区向艺人和生产单位直接定货，并邀请美术家制作各种工艺品的美术设计图样。
    经过半年紧张的筹备工作，一万多件精巧美观的工艺品完成了，从各地陆续运到了北京，并于七月二十五、二十六两日，在中央美术学院大礼堂举行了预展，被邀参观的有首都各机关负责人和各界代表人士，还有许多外宾。
    这次出国展览的美术工艺品中，瓷器的比重最大，占全部展品的百分之三十，其中有景德镇出产的许多新设计的瓷器。其他还有广东石湾、福建德化、河北磁县、江苏宜兴以及云南等地区的陶瓷器，福州和西南艺专出品的漆器，北京、上海和浙江青田、东阳，福建寿山等地的各种象牙、翠玉、玻璃、石、木等雕刻品，以及四川、浙江、福建等地的编织物。另外，还有长沙、苏州、北京的刺绣，上海的绒绣，潮州、烟台的抽纱、网扣，山东的镶嵌，成都、南京的织锦，湖北、安徽的印花布等等。
    各地区艺人们把制作出国展品看作光荣任务，发挥了高度的劳动热情，如：四川自贡以编织纤细的竹丝扇闻名的龚玉璋，六十岁了，这次接受任务后，日夜不停地精心编制，省文化局劝他不要过度操劳，结果，他仍然超额完成了任务。福建泉州刻制木偶的著名艺人江加走，已经七十多岁了，抱病工作，怎么劝阻也没用。福州制花艺人们在完成任务后，联名写信给中国美术家协会说：“我们这次接受和完成了光荣的任务，消除了以往的悲观消极情绪，打破了保守的宗派思想，懂得要交流经验，互相学习，才能有所进步和提高”。
    各地美术工作者与艺人的密切合作，也是这次工作得以顺利完成的一个主要因素。好多地区的美术干部，深入各县、镇去，帮助艺人进行设计和组织临时性的生产小组，制作各种美术工艺品。中央美术学院还特地组织了一个工作队到景德镇去工作了三个多月。
    中国美术家协会在出国工艺美展举行预展时，还邀请了景德镇、杭州、苏州、扬州、上海和广东石湾、河北磁县以及山东等地区的艺人代表和从事工艺美术的干部，来京观摩各地的出品，并连续举行了五次座谈会，互相报告各地美术工艺品的产销情况和改革情况，互相交流经验，商谈了关于如何组织生产和供销等问题。中国美术家协会即将成立的美术服务部，将经常地组织美术家与艺人合作，并与各地美术工艺品生产单位建立产销关系。景德镇准备设立的陶瓷美术研究室和美术瓷厂，中国美术家协会也将大力予以协助。
    经过前后十多天的观摩和座谈等活动以后，各地来京的艺人和干部，都已兴奋地陆续离京回去。他们表示，回去后要把临时性的生产小组改成经常性的生产合作社，进一步改革、发展和提高各种美术工艺品的产量和质量，以满足国内外日益增长的需要。
