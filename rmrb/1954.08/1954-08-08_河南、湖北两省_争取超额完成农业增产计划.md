Henan and Hubei Provinces
Strive to Exceed Agricultural Production Increase Plans

    Henan Province is actively organizing forces to strive to exceed the autumn agricultural production increase plan. Sorghum is ripening throughout the province, spring grain is flowering, and late autumn crops are growing well. However, some areas will experience reduced production due to severe flooding in recent months. To ensure the needs of national construction, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has urgently instructed local Party committees to vigorously lead the masses in widely开展 a production increase, savings, and disaster relief movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation, to ensure the completion of the province's agricultural production increase plan for this year, and strive to exceed the plan. It is required that slightly affected areas strive for more than 50% of the autumn harvest; non-disaster areas, on the basis of ensuring the completion of this year's agricultural production increase plan, strive to increase production by another six jin of grain per mu and one jin of ginned cotton. It is estimated that non-disaster areas can increase autumn grain production by 630 million jin and ginned cotton by 12.5 million jin compared to the original plan. At the same time, it calls on all party members and cadres in the province to recognize the serious political significance of this task, and criticizes the negative emotions of some cadres who believe that "production has reached its peak" and that "the season is too late." At present, many areas have already made specific measures to increase production, and some have already taken action. The Xinyang Special District, which has been severely affected by the disaster, has achieved success in flood prevention, rescue, drainage, and replanting, and can complete this year's production plan; Zhengzhou Special District, which has not been greatly affected by the disaster, is striving to increase the production of 9 million mu of autumn crops by 72 million jin of grain and 44.28 million jin of oil crops such as peanuts and sesame.
    The representatives attending the first session of the First People's Congress of Henan Province also expressed their confidence and determination to mobilize the masses of the province to strive for autumn agricultural production increases when discussing the proposal made by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to the congress on "Striving for the Socialist Industrialization of the Country."

    Xinhua News Agency: The Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Hubei Provincial People's Government held an agricultural technology forum from July 22 to 24 to further study technical guidance for autumn crops in order to strive to complete this year's agricultural production increase plan.
    Hubei Province recently planned to increase grain production by 2 billion jin and ginned cotton by 26 million jin on the basis of the original production increase plan. Strengthening technical guidance is an important key to completing this task. For example, cultivating regenerated rice is one of the important measures for increasing production in the autumn. This year, various parts of the province plan to cultivate regenerated rice on an area of ​​more than 10 million mu, which is four or five times more than last year, and many areas do not have experience in this area. There has been too much rain this year, and cotton must also be strengthened in cultivation and management in order to strive for more harvests. According to these situations, the forum focused on studying the technical problems of multiple planting and more harvesting, cultivating regenerated rice, and cotton field management. After research and discussion, the symposium believed that there are more than three months from autumn harvest to winter sowing. The growth period of general late autumn crops is two to three months. As long as technical guidance is strengthened, planting late autumn crops will not damage the soil fertility and affect winter sowing. However, it is necessary to carry out appropriate close planting according to local conditions, according to the season, and according to the crop, applying sufficient base fertilizer, appropriate top dressing, and preventing insects and drought to promote early maturity. The symposium particularly focused on studying and summarizing the technology and experience of cultivating regenerated rice. It is believed that for those who want to cultivate regenerated rice, the first crop should be harvested three to five days earlier, and the rice stubble should be left slightly longer. After harvesting the rice, top dressing, weeding, and shallow irrigation should be carried out to promote early maturity of the regenerated rice. The symposium also studied how to prevent rice lodging and how cotton fields in disaster-stricken areas should be trenched, cultivated, hoeed, fertilized, and prevented from insects, and how cotton fields in non-disaster-stricken areas should be dewormed, trimmed, and topped.

    河南、湖北两省
    争取超额完成农业增产计划
    河南省积极组织力量，争取超额完成秋季农业增产计划。全省高粱将熟，春谷正在扬花，晚秋作物也长得很好。惟近月来部分地区将因遭受严重水灾而减产。为保证国家建设需要，中共河南省委紧急指示各地党委大力领导群众广泛开展以互助合作为中心的增产节约救灾运动，保证完成全省今年农业增产计划，并力争超额完成计划。要求在轻灾区争取秋季有五成以上收成；非灾区在保证完成今年农业增产计划的基础上，力争每亩再增产原粮六斤，皮棉一斤，预计非灾区可比原计划增产秋粮六亿三千万斤，皮棉一千二百五十万斤。同时号召全省党员干部认清这个任务的严重政治意义，批判了某些干部中存在着“增产到顶”和“季节已晚”的消极情绪。目前，不少地区已经做出了增产的具体措施，有的并已行动起来。灾情较重的信阳专区防汛抢救、排水补种等工作已获得成绩，可完成今年的生产计划；灾情不大的郑州专区正在力争九百万亩的秋禾超额增产原粮七千二百万斤，花生芝麻等油料作物超额增产四千四百二十八万斤。
    正在举行河南省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议的代表们，在讨论中共河南省委向大会提出“为国家社会主义工业化而奋斗”的建议时，也对动员全省群众争取秋季农业增产表示了信心与决心。

    湖北省人民政府农林厅在七月二十二日到二十四日召开农业技术座谈会，进一步研究对秋季作物的技术指导，以争取完成今年的农业增产计划。
    湖北省最近计划在原增产计划基础上共增产粮食二十亿斤和皮棉二千六百万斤。加强技术指导是完成这一任务的重要关键。如培植再生稻是秋季增产的重要措施之一，今年省内各地计划培育再生稻面积达一千多万亩，比去年多四、五倍，不少地区没有这方面的经验。今年雨水过多，棉花也必须加强培育管理，才能争取更多的收成。座谈会根据这些情况，着重研究了多种多收，培育再生稻，棉花田间管理等技术问题。座谈会经过研究、讨论，认为从秋收到冬播有三个多月的时间，一般晚秋作物的生长期为两个多月到三个月，只要加强技术指导，种晚秋作物是不会损伤地力和影响冬播的。但是必需因地制宜、因时制宜、因作物制宜进行适当密植，施足底肥，适当追肥，防虫防旱促其早熟。座谈会特别着重研究并总结了培育再生稻的技术和经验。认为凡要培育再生稻的，头谷最好提前三、五天收割，留谷桩要稍长。割谷后要追肥，薅草，灌浅水，以促使再生稻早熟。座谈会还研究了防止稻谷倒伏和受灾地区的棉田如何开沟、培土、锄草、施肥、防虫，未受灾地区的棉田如何除虫、整枝摘心等问题。
