Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Harbin and other cities: Graduates from Higher and Secondary Specialized Schools Begin Work Successively

This summer, graduates from universities and secondary specialized schools in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Harbin, and other cities are successively departing to take up work positions assigned by the state.  More than 5,400 graduates from fourteen universities in Shanghai began departing in batches on the 19th, with more than half being transferred to the Northeast, North China, and Northwest regions to participate in work related to relevant departments.  The vast majority of graduates transferred to various industrial departments have been directly assigned to work in factories and mines. The East China Administrative Council, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and various universities jointly held a farewell meeting on the 19th.  At the meeting, Jin Xuecheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the East China Administrative Council, Liu Jiping, Deputy Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Yao Nai, President of the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, and Zhu Tingqing, representative of the graduates' parents, spoke successively, hoping that the graduates would work hard in their positions, humbly learn from the masses, and become strong fighters engaged in the socialist construction of the motherland.

This summer, Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have more than 4,000 graduates from universities and secondary specialized schools participating in the country's construction work. Among them, more than 1,100 graduates from Sun Yat-sen University, South China Normal College, and South China Agricultural College, and more than 1,300 graduates from secondary specialized schools in Guangzhou have successively gone to Central South, Northeast, Northwest, and North China to participate in work in July and early August. The remaining graduates will also depart successively in August.

More than 230 of the 400-plus first graduates of the Huazhong Institute of Technology in Wuhan have been the first to leave the school and be assigned to various parts of the Northeast to participate in work. Graduates going to North China, Inner Mongolia, Northwest, Southwest and other places are also busy packing, and will soon depart.

Most of the more than 2,700 graduates from colleges and some secondary specialized schools in Harbin have taken up their work positions. Graduates from Northeast Agricultural College and Northeast Forestry College have gone to relevant agricultural and forestry departments in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as well as the Northeast State-owned Farm Administration Bureau and various forest industry departments in the Northeast to participate in work. More than 300 graduates from Harbin Normal College have gone to work in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Harbin, Shenyang, and other provinces and cities. Graduates from Harbin Foreign Language College have gone to work as translators in departments under the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry, Ministry of Geology, and other departments.
