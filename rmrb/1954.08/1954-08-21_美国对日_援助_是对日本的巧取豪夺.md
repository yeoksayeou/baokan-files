    US "Aid" to Japan is a Shameless Plunder
    The negotiations between the United States and the Japanese government regarding the repayment of post-war US "aid" to Japan are underway in Tokyo. The reason for the negotiations is that the United States wants Japan to treat the so-called "aid" the US gave Japan after the war as "debt" to be repaid. The United States has already carried out brutal plunder in Japan by using this "aid" after the war, and now it is attempting to extract a double price from Japan. This kind of shameless extortion has become one of the most unscrupulous methods in modern international relations.
    The so-called post-war US "aid" to Japan refers to the large quantities of surplus materials that the United States dumped on Japan under the guise of "Government Account for Relief in Occupied Areas" and "Government Account for Relief in Occupied Areas" from 1946 to 1951. Although the United States began to demand Japan to repay this "aid" after the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the United States has failed to produce any factual basis to prove that this "aid" is indeed a debt owed by Japan to the United States. The amount of "aid" is also a confused mess. Even when the formal negotiations on the repayment of "aid" began in May of this year, neither the United States nor Japan had a definite list of accounts. The US side estimates that the total amount of "aid" is about 2.044 billion US dollars, while the Japanese side believes that the US estimate has repetitions and is probably only 1.954 billion US dollars.
    Speaking of US "aid," especially the issue of repayment, Japanese people with a national conscience are heartbroken. The fact is very clear that US "aid" was not for "relief" purposes, but to promote its post-war aggression policy and ease its own economic crisis. Former US Under Secretary of the Army Voorhees admitted at the US 81st Congress Budget Committee while testifying for the US aid to Japan fee for the 1951 fiscal year: This "aid" was to "establish non-communist Germany and Japan," which in reality was to turn Japan into a US military base and colony for aggression in Asia. Former US occupation forces headquarters finance advisor Dodge also said very clearly: The materials "aided" to Japan "are all surplus materials, which have been bought by the US Commodity Credit Corporation, but this is because it must be bought according to current legislation. Precisely because of this, this kind of aid to Japan, whether now or in the future, does not mean an increase in (US) government spending. Eighty-five percent of the total aid to Japan in 1951 was to purchase and transport US surplus materials." Among these surplus materials, 50 to 80 percent were grains of extremely poor quality, and many were materials with no commodity value at all. The United States calculated these materials in the aid to Japan fee at extremely high prices. In order to ensure the high profits of American shipping capitalists, the transportation fee was calculated at the wartime freight rate of 15 to 20 US dollars per ton. The price of US "aid" wheat was as high as 110 to 120 US dollars per ton.
    For the United States, giving "aid" was a good deal with generous profits; however, for Japan, receiving "aid" was a deeply disastrous scourge. Whenever the United States transported "aid" materials, Japan immediately allocated the payment calculated according to the US price into the "Dollar Counterpart Fund" account, and used the taxes collected from the Japanese people and the money obtained from the compulsory sale of "aid" materials to offset this bill. The right to use the "Dollar Counterpart Fund" was in the hands of the United States. More than 90 percent of this money was used for investment in Japanese public and private enterprises and to strengthen financial capital. In the three years up to 1951, the United States used the "Dollar Counterpart Fund" to invest a total of 316.3 billion yen in Japan. These investments were concentrated in Japan's power, shipping, coal, and steel enterprises. In this way, the United States controlled the lifeline of the Japanese economy, supported Japanese industries related to military production, and paved the way for further economic militarization later.
    The US implementation of surplus material dumping in the form of "aid" to Japan also caused the Japanese economy to become dependent on the United States, destroying Japan's multilateral economic relations with other countries in the world, and replacing them with a unilateral economic relationship with the United States. Due to the large amount of grain dumping, the development of Japanese agricultural productivity was severely hit, and the crisis of food shortage was intensified. This also formed a factor in Japan's need to import a large amount of grain today, thereby deepening the foreign exchange crisis. On the other hand, the large import of grain also provided conditions for the Japanese ruling group to forcibly lower the price of grain collection from farmers, and also helped to implement a low-wage policy for workers.
    While paying for the high-priced "aid" materials, the Japanese people were also forced to pay "post-war settlement fees" (occupation fees) several times the amount of "aid." In the same period from 1946 to 1951, the "post-war settlement fees" paid by the Japanese people reached as much as 5 billion US dollars. This kind of "post-war settlement fee" far exceeded the scope of the occupation army maintenance fee stipulated in international agreements. The United States used it to build countless military bases in Japan. The United States also used "post-war settlement fees" to support the Japanese military industry monopoly capital that was in crisis after the war. Taking 1947 as an example, 22 percent of Japan's pig iron production, 37 percent of galvanized iron sheets, and 45 percent of cement were produced with "post-war settlement fees." At the same time, the heavy burden of "post-war settlement fees" made the poverty of the Japanese people even deeper, and the domestic consumer market was extremely reduced, causing the civilian industry to shrink.
    However, despite the fact that the US "aid" to Japan is actually such a shameless plunder, and the US has extorted from Japan in many ways over the years to an extent that is impossible to estimate, the Japanese government has affirmed from the beginning of the negotiations with the United States that this "aid" is a debt owed by Japan to the United States, and will continue to obtain similar "aid" through treasonous treaties such as the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement." According to Kyodo News, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida is prepared to accept the US proposal to repay 650 million US dollars in "aid," and he "expects that the Washington government will take steps to flow the paid money back to Japan in the future." This also confirms that the US is forcing Japan to repay "aid" in order to extort another sum of money from Japan and use the name of "aid" to Japan to urge Japan to step up its rearmament.

### 美国对日“援助”是对日本的巧取豪夺

    美国对日“援助”是对日本的巧取豪夺
    美国和日本政府之间关于偿还战后美国对日本的“援助”的谈判正在东京进行。谈判的原因是因为美国要日本把美国战后对日本的所谓“援助”当作“债务”来偿还。美国在战后利用这种“援助”已经在日本进行了残酷的掠夺，现在又企图向日本索取双倍的代价，这种巧取豪夺的手段已成为近代国际关系中最无耻的手法之一。
    所谓战后美国对日本的“援助”，是指从一九四六年到一九五一年间美国用“占领地区行政救济”和“占领地区紧急救济”的美名对日本倾销的大量剩余物资。虽然在旧金山单独对日和约签订以后美国就开始要日本偿还这些“援助”，美国却未能举出任何事实根据，证明这些“援助”确实是日本对美国的债务。“援助”的数额也是一笔糊涂账，甚至在今年五月间偿还“援助”的正式谈判开始时，美日双方都没有一份确实的账目清单。美方估计“援助”总额有二十亿四千四百万美元左右，日方认为美方的估计数字有重复，大概只有十九亿五千四百万美元。
    谈到美国的“援助”，特别是偿还问题，有民族良心的日本人莫不痛心疾首。事实很清楚，美国的“援助”并不是出于“救济”目的，而是为了推行它战后的侵略政策和缓和自己的经济危机。美国前陆军部副部长沃希斯在美国第八十一届国会预算委员会上为美国一九五一会计年度对日“援助”费作证时曾经承认：这种“援助”是为了“建立非共产主义的德国和日本”，实际上也就是为了把日本变成美国侵略亚洲的军事基地和殖民地。前美国驻日占领军总部财政顾问道奇也非常明白地说过：“援助”日本的物资“全是剩余物资，这些物资虽然已由美国商品信用公司买进，但这是根据现行立法非买不可的。正因为如此，这类物资的对日援助，不论现在或将来，都不意味着是增加（美国）政府的支出。一九五一年度对日援助总额中，百分之八十五是购买和运输美国的剩余物资。”这些剩余物资中有百分之五十到八十是质量极端恶劣的粮食，还有许多是根本没有商品价值的物资。美国以极高的价格把这些物资计算在对日“援助”费里。为了保证美国航运资本家的高额利润，运输费按照每吨十五到二十美元的战时运费计算。美国“援助”小麦每吨的价格高达一百一十到一百二十美元。
    对美国来说，给予“援助”是一笔利润优厚的好买卖；但是，对日本来说，接受“援助”却是一件灾难深重的祸根。每逢美国运来“援助”物资，日本就要立即将根据美国价格计算的货款拨入“美元对等资金”帐户，并且用从日本人民头上征收来的捐税和强制配售“援助”物资得来的钱来抵这笔账，“美元对等资金”的运用大权操在美国手中。这笔钱有百分之九十以上是用在对日本公私企业投资和加强金融资本上。在到一九五一年为止的三年中，美国利用“美元对等资金”在日本共投资三千一百六十三亿日元。这些投资集中在日本的电力、海运、煤、钢铁各个企业中。这样，美国就控制了日本经济的命脉，扶植了与军需生产有关的日本工业，并且为后来进一步的经济军事化铺平了道路。
    美国以“援助”的方式对日本实行的剩余物资倾销也造成了日本经济对美国的依赖，破坏了日本与世界上其他国家的多边的经济关系，而代以和美国的单方面的经济联系。由于大量的粮食倾销，日本农业生产力的发展受到了严重的打击，使粮食不足的危机尖锐化。这也形成了日本今天需要进口大量粮食从而加深外汇危机的一个因素。另一方面，粮食的大量输入也给日本统治集团提供了条件，便于他们对农民强行压低征粮的价格，也有助于实行对工人的低工资政策。
    日本人民在支付高价的“援助”物资的货款的同时，还被迫付出了数倍于“援助”额的“终战处理费”（占领费）。就在一九四六年到一九五一年的同一时期中，日本人民付出的“终战处理费”达五十亿美元之多。这种“终战处理费”远远超出了国际协议所规定的占领军维持费的范围，美国用它在日本修建了无数的军事基地。美国还用“终战处理费”扶植了在战后处于危机状态的日本军需工业垄断资本。以一九四七年为例，日本铣铁产量的百分之二十二、镀锌铁板的百分之三十七、水泥的百分之四十五都是靠“终战处理费”生产出来的。同时，“终战处理费”的沉重负担，使日本人民的贫困更为加深，国内民需消费市场极度缩小，使民用工业遭到萎缩。
    但是，尽管美国对日本的“援助”实际上是这样的巧取豪夺，美国几年来对日本的多方面的榨取已经多到无法估计的程度，日本政府在和美国举行的谈判中却自始就肯定这种“援助”是日本欠美国的债务，并且要通过美日“共同防御援助协定”之类的卖国条约来继续取得类似的“援助”。据共同社透露，日本首相吉田准备接受美国提出的偿还
  “援助”六亿五千万美元的计划，他“预料华盛顿政府以后将会采取步骤把支付的钱流回到日本”。这也就证实了美国迫使日本偿还“援助”，是要再从日本讹诈出一笔钱来又用对日“援助”的美名来促使日本加紧重整军备。（新华社）
