Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th (TASS dispatch)
    The Geneva Conference has shown that negotiations between the countries concerned on outstanding international issues can yield positive results. It provides important evidence that it is indeed possible to ease world tensions and consolidate peace. It opens the way for the countries concerned to resolve other outstanding issues, first and foremost the issue of safeguarding peace and security in Europe.

    In order to ease international tensions and strengthen peace, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of France, Great Britain, and the United States on July 24 regarding the issue of collective security in Europe. In this note, the Soviet Union proposed convening a meeting in the coming months with the participation of all European countries willing to attend, as well as the United States, and with a representative of the People's Republic of China attending as an observer, to discuss the issue of collective security in Europe.

    In order to discuss issues related to this conference beforehand, the Soviet government proposed on August 4 convening a meeting of the foreign ministers of France, Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet ambassadors in Paris, London, and Washington, acting on the instructions of the Soviet government, stated that the Soviet government emphasized that it considered it useful for the governments of France, Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to jointly discuss in advance the issues of convening the conference proposed in the Soviet note of July 24 and measures to ensure the success of the conference.

    The Soviet government proposed convening a meeting of the four foreign ministers in August and September of this year, at which the German question could also be further studied.

    The statement said: "In doing so, the Soviet government also takes into account the fact that agreement has not yet been reached on the main aspects of the German question, namely the restoration of Germany's unity and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, because so far all the necessary conditions for this have obviously not been established. Under these circumstances, the Soviet government believes that new efforts should be made to first reach agreement on certain aspects of the German question, regarding which solutions acceptable to the parties concerned can now be found."

    In its note of July 24 and its statement of August 4, the Soviet government put forward an absolutely timely proposal for studying all important European issues—the issue of European security and the issue of Germany. The maintenance of peace and security not only in Europe, but also in the world, depends to a large extent on the resolution of these issues. This is unanimously acknowledged by the vast majority of politicians in all countries of Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

    The French newspaper "Le Monde" emphasized the urgent need to discuss and resolve European issues, especially after the end of the Geneva Conference. Commenting on the Soviet note of July 24, "Le Monde" said: "In addition to the achievements already made, the Geneva Conference has undoubtedly greatly changed the situation. After many meetings had been held in the past without results, the Geneva Conference restored people's confidence in the benefits of consultation." The Czechoslovak newspaper "Rude Pravo" pointed out: "Peace-loving people believe that the situation arising from this cannot but be used to solve the problem of European security… and the German question."

    In the two weeks since the publication of the Soviet note, newspapers around the world have been discussing the issues raised in the Soviet note every day. The Soviet government's statement of August 4 is the subject of widespread commentary in newspapers of various countries. The London "Times" spoke in this regard of the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and the particular importance of great power talks, which are matters of great concern to the British public. The "Times" said: Experience reminds Britain that it is possible to reconcile conflicting interests through consultation and agreement. The "Times" said: Therefore, coexistence is more than just preventing war.

    In France, the Soviet proposal has attracted particular attention. French public figures of various political persuasions know that France is in a difficult situation due to the aggressive policy of the United States in Europe. France is once again facing the threat of the revival of its hereditary enemy—German militarism. France's opponents say that France has no third choice but to agree to either the "European Army" led by the Bonn revanchists or the direct restoration of the West German defense forces.

    However, the French public firmly believes that France can follow other methods to avoid the dangers caused by the revival of German militarism. The weekly "France Observateur" pointed out: "In view of the prospects opened up by the Soviet Union's recent note and the success of the Geneva Conference, is it not time for France to take the initiative to abandon its previous plans and put forward concrete proposals on European issues? We hope that the new French government will carry out this work and abandon the methods that have led us to failure."

    The Soviet proposal opens up concrete prospects for the quickest resolution of the German question, which is a matter of great concern to the people of Europe, especially the German people. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, embodying the interests of the entire German people, has decided to request the Federal Assembly in Bonn to jointly issue a solemn appeal to the four powers, suggesting the resumption of the interrupted negotiations on the German question, and that no steps be taken before the end of the meeting to include any part of Germany in any military alliance. The German Democratic Republic has expressed its support for the Soviet proposal to establish a European collective security system. The majority of the people in West Germany, as well as some political leaders, including Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer, also support this proposal to guarantee European collective security.

    Only those who openly recognize themselves as enemies of European security are unhappy with the Soviet proposal. The Soviet note of July 24, and especially the Soviet government's statement of August 4, has caused confusion and panic in their camp.

    However, it is worth noting that despite their vicious attacks and slanderous remarks, they have had to admit that the Soviet proposal is timely and of great significance for the continued development of international relations.

    The reactionary American newspapers admit that the Soviet Union put forward this proposal at a time when the ruling circles of the United States are deliberately trying to rebuild German militarism and establish an aggressive military alliance in Western Europe at any cost. The American newspapers, resenting that the Soviet proposal has hindered the realization of these plans, unintentionally said that the proposal is in line with the European people's desire to consolidate peace. According to the "New York Times," the Soviet note has once again touched on the issue of peace and security that is of great concern to the general public… The Russians are walking the road that leads to peace. In assessing the current positions of the United States and the Soviet Union in the world, this is very important, because it is a reflection of the general assessment of developments at the Geneva Conference on the European continent. … It is for this reason that a serious situation is forming for the United States. This newspaper said that all of America's plans in Europe are under threat.

    The more agitated and annoyed the American diplomats and propagandists are by the Soviet note, the more clearly the public in various European countries sees that this proposal is aimed at pursuing a clear goal—strengthening European security and international peace cooperation. The Soviet Union has been and is waging a persistent struggle against plans to prepare for a new war. Its struggle is receiving increasing support from all peace-loving humanity. The Soviet people are convinced that the Soviet government's recent proposals to establish an all-European collective security system and resolve the German question will contribute to further easing international tensions and strengthening peace.

    为了加强和平和缓和国际紧张局势
    ——苏联“真理报”七日社论
    日内瓦会议已经表明，有关国家之间就悬而未决的国际问题举行的谈判能够带来积极的结果。它提供了重要的证据，证明的确有可能缓和世界紧张局势和巩固和平。它为有关国家解决其他悬而未决的问题，首先是保卫欧洲和平和安全问题开辟了道路。
    为了缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平，苏联政府在七月二十四日就欧洲集体安全问题向法国、英国和美国政府提出照会。在这个照会中，苏联建议在今后几个月中召开一个有愿意出席的一切欧洲国家以及美国参加、并有一位中华人民共和国代表以观察员身分列席的会议，以讨论欧洲集体安全问题。
    为了先行讨论有关这个会议的问题，苏联政府在八月四日建议召开法国、英国、美国和苏联的外长会议。苏联驻巴黎、伦敦和华盛顿的大使奉苏联政府的命令提出的声明中说，苏联政府强调指出，它认为由法国、英国、美国和苏联政府先行共同讨论召开苏联七月二十四日的照会中所建议的会议的问题和促使会议获得成功的措施是有用处的。
    苏联政府建议在今年八九月间召开一个四国外长会议，这个会上还可以继续研究德国问题。
    声明说：“苏联政府在这样做的时候也考虑到这一事实：关于德国问题的主要方面，即恢复德国的统一和与德国缔结和约问题，到目前还未能达成协议，因为到目前为止关于这一点的一切必要条件显然还没有建立起来。在这种情况下，苏联政府认为应当进行新的努力，以便首先就德国问题的某些方面达成协议，关于这些方面，现在已能找到能为有关方面接受的解决办法。”
    苏联政府在七月二十四日的照会和八月四日的声明中，提出了一个关于研究所有重要的欧洲问题——欧洲安全问题和德国问题——的绝对切时的建议。不仅是欧洲的和平和安全的维护，同时是全世界的和平和安全的维护，在很大的程度上都要取决于这些问题的解决。这是欧洲、亚洲和美洲所有国家的绝大部分政界人士所一致承认的。
    法国报纸“世界报”强调指出迫切需要讨论和解决欧洲问题，特别是在日内瓦会议结束以后。“世界报”就苏联七月二十四日的照会发表评论说：“日内瓦会议除了已取得的成绩以外，无疑地还大大地改变了局势。过去曾经开过许多次会议而毫无结果，在这样的情况下，日内瓦会议恢复了人们对协商的好处的信心。”捷克斯洛伐克报纸“红色权利报”指出：“爱好和平的人认为由此而产生的局势不可能不用来解决欧洲安全问题……和德国问题。”
    自从苏联照会发表以来的两个星期中，全世界的报纸每天都在讨论苏联照会所提出的问题。苏联政府八月四日发表的声明是各国报纸广泛评论的对象。伦敦“泰晤士报”在这方面谈到不同社会制度的国家的和平共处的可能性和必要性，以及大国会谈的特别重要性，这些都是使英国广大公众非常关心的问题。“泰晤士报”说：经验提醒英国，利用协商和协议来调和互相冲突的利益是可能的。“泰晤士报”说：因此，共处不只是防止战争而已。
    在法国，苏联的建议吸引了特别的注意。不同政治倾向的法国公众人士都知道，由于美国在欧洲的侵略政策，法国处于一种困难的境地。法国再度面临着它的世仇——德国军国主义——复活的威胁。法国的对手们说，法国要么同意以波恩复仇主义者为首的“欧洲军”，要么同意直接恢复西德国防军，除此以外，没有第三条路可走。
    然而，法国公众坚决认为法国可以遵循别的方法来避免德国军国主义复活所引起的危险。“法兰西观察家”周刊指出：“由于苏联最近的照会以及日内瓦会议的成功所打开的前景，现在不正是法国采取主动撒开以前的各项计划而提出关于欧洲问题的具体建议的时候了吗？我们希望法国新政府进行这种工作，放弃已经把我们导向失败的方法。”
    苏联建议打开了最快地解决德国问题的具体前景，德国问题是一个对欧洲各国人民、首先是德国人民有重大关系的事情。德意志民主共和国人民议院体现德国全体人民的利益，已决定要求波恩的联邦议院联名向四国发出庄严的呼吁，建议恢复中断了的关于德国问题的谈判，并在会议结束前不得采取任何步骤把德国的任何一个部分包括在任何军事联盟之内。德意志民主共和国已表示赞成苏联所提出的建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。西德的大部分人民以及若干政治领袖，包括社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔在内，也支持这种保障欧洲集体安全的建议。
    只有直认是欧洲安全的敌人的人不高兴苏联建议。苏联在七月二十四日提出的照会、特别是苏联政府八月四日的声明，已在他们的阵营中引起了混乱和恐慌。
    然而，值得注意的是尽管他们发出恶毒的攻击和毁谤的言论，然而他们却不得不承认苏联建议是合时宜的，并且是对于继续发展国际关系有极重要的意义的。
    美国反动报纸承认苏联是在这样的时候提出这个建议的：美国的统治集团正在处心积虑地要不惜任何代价重建德国军国主义和建立西欧的侵略性军事联盟。美国报纸因苏联的建议使得这些计划的实现受到妨碍而表示恼恨，在无意中说出这个建议是符合于欧洲人民要求巩固和平的愿望的。据“纽约时报”说，苏联的照会再一次触到了一般人非常关心的和平和安全的问题……俄国人正在走着导向和平的道路。在估计目前美国和苏联在世界的地位的时候，这一点是十分重要的，因为这是欧洲大陆上对于日内瓦会议上的事态发展所普遍持有的估计的一种反映。……就是为了这个缘故，对美国来说，一种严重的局面正在形成中。这家报纸说，美国所有在欧洲的计划都受到了威胁。
    美国外交人员们和宣传人员们对苏联照会的反应越烦躁和恼怒，那末欧洲各国公众也越明显地看出，这个建议是为了追求一个明确的目的——加强欧洲的安全和国际和平合作。苏联过去和现在都在进行坚持不懈的斗争，反对准备新战争的计划。它的这个斗争得到全体爱好和平人类越来越多的支持。苏联人民深信，苏联政府最近为了建立一个全欧集体安全体系和解决德国问题而提出的建议将有利于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平。
