Early-season apples from the apple-producing areas of the Liaodong Peninsula, such as Gaiping, Xinjin, and Fuxian, as well as Dalian and Jin County, are entering the market in large quantities. It is estimated that the yield of early-season apples in these areas will increase by about 20 percent this year compared to last year. Currently, farmers in various apple-producing areas are continuously delivering various varieties of early-season apples to the purchasing stations of state-owned food companies and supply and marketing cooperatives. The Gaiping County Company of the China Food Company purchased more than 1,200 tons from July 2nd to July 30th.

The early-season apples already purchased in various places have mostly been sold to cities such as Dalian, Anshan, Shenyang, Fushun, Harbin, and Beijing, and another part will be exported. This year, apple-growing farmers have been carefully selecting the apples supplied for national export. (Xinhua News Agency)

    辽东半岛的伏苹果大量上市
    辽东半岛盛产苹果的盖平、新金和复县以及旅大市、金县等地的伏苹果大量上市。预计今年以上地区的伏苹果产量将比去年增加百分之二十左右。目前，各苹果产区的农民，每天络绎不绝地把各种品种的伏苹果，送到各国营食品公司和供销合作社的收购站出售，中国食品公司盖平县公司从七月二日到七月三十日就收购了一千二百多吨。
    各地已收购的伏苹果现已大部分销往旅大、鞍山、沈阳、抚顺、哈尔滨和北京等城市，另一部分将要出口。种苹果的农民今年对供应国家出口的苹果，都经过精心选择。（新华社）
