    Hunan Province's Intermediate Rice Generally Ripens
    Farmers Carefully Harvest to Ensure Every Grain Returns Home
    In Hunan Province, approximately three million mu of early rice in mountainous and hilly areas has now been basically harvested. Nearly forty million mu of intermediate rice throughout the province is nearing maturity. The Xiangdong region is expected to enter the full harvest stage in late August. During the early rice harvest, farmers in various regions generally paid attention to careful threshing and harvesting, beginning to change their rough harvesting habits. Some agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams arranged labor in advance of the harvest and added or improved tools. Some also held symposiums on harvesting techniques, resulting in a general reduction of waste by six or seven jin to ten or more jin of rice per mu compared to previous years. In Hejialong Township, Liling County, Xiangdong, over 20,000 jin of rice will be harvested from 3,300 mu of early rice this year. The mutual aid team led by Li Chenggui, a model rice producer, harvested over 400 jin more rice from just over 50 mu of early rice. Other vast areas are also actively making material and ideological preparations to welcome the full harvest of intermediate rice, ensuring that not a single grain of rice is lost.

    湖南省中稻普遍黄熟
    农民精细收割保证颗粒还家
    湖南省山区、丘陵区三百万亩左右的早稻，现已基本收割完毕，全省近四千万亩的中稻均近黄熟，湘东地区在八月下旬即可进入全面收割阶段。在早稻收割过程中，各地农民一般注意了细打细收，开始改变收割粗糙的习惯。有些农业社和互助组在收割前即安排好了劳力，并添置或改进了工具；还有的召开了收割技术座谈会，使每亩田一般比往年少浪费六、七斤至十来斤谷子。湘东的醴陵县何家垅乡在三千三百亩早稻田中，今年即能多收两万多斤稻谷；水稻丰产模范李呈桂领导的互助组，五十多亩早稻田即多收了四百多斤稻谷。其他广大地区为了迎接中稻的全面收割，也在积极作好物质和思想准备，保证不丢掉一粒稻谷。  （周三才　萧传京）
