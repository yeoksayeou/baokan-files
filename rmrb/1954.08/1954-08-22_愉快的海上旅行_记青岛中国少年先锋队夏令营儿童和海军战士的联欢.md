A Joyful Sea Voyage
    —A Record of the Get-Together Between Children of the China Young Pioneers Summer Camp in Qingdao and Naval Soldiers
    Ni Huanghe

    On August 5th, a ship of the People's Navy took the Young Pioneers of the China Young Pioneers Summer Camp on a "sea voyage."
    This was a day filled with happiness and joy.
    At eleven o'clock that morning, two hundred and twenty-four little guests boarded the ship. They came from all regions and ethnic groups of the motherland, including forty international little friends from Korea, Vietnam, and Bulgaria. Each of them wore a red scarf and a white hat, truly like a flock of little doves symbolizing peace and hope, flying together onto the warship, truly like clusters of beautiful flowers, blooming on the warship. The sailors were happy from the bottom of their hearts, they whispered to each other:
      "How beautiful, how lovely, this group of little angels!"
      "To protect them, I'd be willing to dive into water and jump into fire!"
    The naval soldiers and the Young Pioneers quickly merged together. They held hands, dancing and singing together. The resounding singing echoed on the sea. The warship carried songs and dances, carrying happiness and joy, sailing towards the beautiful ocean of the motherland.
    Cannons, machines, instruments, sailboats on the sea, faintly visible islands, and the seagulls swirling and dancing with the warship, all powerfully attracted the children. All kinds of questions were constantly raised, and the sailors patiently and enthusiastically explained them.
      "Uncle, what is that?" A child asked curiously, pointing to a buoy swaying on the sea.
      "That is the people's police on the sea!" Gao Quanfa, the squad leader of the No. 2 gun crew, replied with a smile. "Don't you often see people's police at intersections on land, extending their arms to direct the traffic? We have these buoys on the sea to take on the work of the people's police, giving us directions for navigation so that our ships don't run aground or encounter danger. Their contribution is great!"
    The children couldn't help clapping their hands together happily, they raised their hands to the top of their heads and shouted loudly:
    "People's police on the sea, we salute you!"
    Although the international little friends did not speak the same language, they still enthusiastically pulled the sailors aside, talking incessantly, using gestures and smiles to express their feelings. A little girl from Bulgaria named Lida pulled An Yulin, the fifth squad leader of the engine room, to her side, learned a few simple Chinese words from him, and then copied the words "Chinese People's Liberation Army" on his chest badge, stroke by stroke, into her small notebook. Li Guangyang, a thirteen-year-old little friend from Vietnam, was a hero of the youth guerrilla who had been arrested by the enemy three times but never yielded. Now, he raised two small fists and shouted, "Mao Zedong! Ho Chi Minh!" Then, he pressed his two fists tightly together and punched downwards with force. No more words were needed to supplement it. The naval soldiers were all moved by him.
    The sailor Wang Zheyan was explaining the cannon to a group of children. He leaned forward, pushed his hands upwards, and opened his mouth: "Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang..." just like a cannon. The children surrounded him, raising their small faces, with bright eyes, listening intently. A child named Xiang Jiajing put on a sailor's hat, climbed onto the gunner's seat, and held the cannon tightly, refusing to let go. He said:
    "I want to be a little gunner and fight the American devils!"
    These pure words made the sailors laugh.
    The warship was sailing against the wind and waves on the vast ocean of the motherland. On the command platform, Captain Song, surrounded by red scarves, watched the course, sometimes issuing an order to the duty officer, and sometimes waving to the Young Pioneers rotating on the deck. At this time, a high-pitched voice suddenly came from behind him: "Report Comrade Captain, may I come up?"
    Hey, that's interesting, a child was climbing on the edge of the command platform, trying to come up! He needed a hand! Captain Song quickly picked him up, and asked lovingly, "What's your name? How old are you?"
    The child broke free from the captain's arms, stood at attention, saluted, and said, "Report Comrade Captain! My name is Zhu Huimin, ten years and three months old, I want to join the navy and become a sailor in the future!"
    Captain Song nodded and said, "You will definitely be an excellent sailor in the future, come, let's have a practice now!" Saying this, he hung a pair of binoculars around the child's neck, and pointed and tested him kindly:
  "What do you see in front? What do you see on the left? What do you see on the right?"
    The child counted the sails one moment, and explored the islands in front the next, he answered the captain's questions, happily and joyfully jumping and saying, "So clear, so clear, my eyes have become brighter!"
    The Young Pioneers loved the ocean of the motherland, they loved everything on the sea, they really wanted to live on the sea! A Miao child named Yang Ximing from the plateau area of Guizhou, held a sailor's hand, and asked earnestly:
      "Uncle, what preparations do you need to make to be a sailor?"
    The sailor smiled and said, "Want to be a sailor? Well, you need to prepare these: a high degree of political awareness and cultural and scientific knowledge, a strong will, a healthy body, and lively emotions."
    The child quickly took out a small notebook from his pocket and wrote down the sailor's words word by word. At the same time, he muttered to himself, "It's really glorious to be a sailor, but it's also really not easy."
    The sailor quickly added, "Being a sailor requires a lot, it's indeed not easy; but, if you have determination..."
    Before the child could let the sailor finish speaking, he punched the small notebook with his small fist, and said repeatedly, "I have determination, I have determination, I will definitely prepare according to these conditions."
    The children all competed to tell the naval uncles about their ideals and aspirations, some wanted to be engineers, some wanted to be agriculturalists, some wanted to be national defense fighters, and one child named Tian Shaowen said: "I have three aspirations: the first is to be a steelworker; the second is to be a tractor driver; the third, when it is necessary to defend the motherland, to be a tank driver and rush towards the enemy!"
    Every naval soldier was deeply moved by the children's ideals and wishes. Gunner Yu Jingke pulled a group of Young Pioneers to his chest, he was so excited that he almost shed tears. He recalled his childhood, which he spent under whips and bitterness. He looked at the happy new generation of the motherland with kind eyes, and stroked the children's heads with his big and strong hands, saying emotionally:
    "Children, you can rest assured and boldly strive for your ideals! We are here to protect you!"
    Returning to port. After the warship docked, the sailors and the Young Pioneers danced a great unity dance, singing "Unity is Strength!" all the way from the deck to the dock. They separated, but the hearts of the naval soldiers and the Young Pioneers were forever linked together. The naval soldiers' souvenir books were filled with the children's gratitude and expectations.
    ——Dear naval uncles, it is you who guard the gate of the motherland, so that we can study with peace of mind, sleep sweetly every night, and eat heartily every meal!
    ——You are the pillar of happiness! You are our role models!
    ——Don't let the American devils come to destroy our happiness, you must be vigilant, no matter if a bird flies over from the air or a blade of grass floats over from the sea, please take a closer look, uncles!
   ——We hope that you will work hard to liberate Taiwan and save the millions of children in Taiwan!
    We must protect the future builders and defenders of the motherland! Protect the peace and happiness of the motherland! As the Young Pioneers waving their white hats gradually moved away, the naval soldiers' determination and belief became even firmer. (Attached pictures)
    Naval soldiers hold a ceremony on the deck of the warship to welcome the Young Pioneers. Wang Zaiming, Li Tao, and Li Shize photographed it.
    Naval soldiers and Korean, Bulgarian, and Chinese children are enjoying the vast and beautiful ocean. Wang Zhiyuan took the photo.

    愉快的海上旅行
    ——记青岛中国少年先锋队夏令营儿童和海军战士的联欢
    倪黄河
    八月五日，人民海军某舰载着中国少年先锋队夏令营的少先队员们去作了一次“海上旅行”。
    这是一个充满幸福和快乐的日子。
    这天上午十一时，两百二十四名小客人登舰了。他们来自祖国各个地区各个民族，其中还有四十名是来自朝鲜、越南和保加利亚的国际小友人。他们一个个围着红领巾，戴着小白帽，真像一群象征着和平和希望的小鸽子，一齐飞到军舰上来了，真像一簇簇美丽的鲜花，在军舰上开放了。水兵们一直乐到心底，他们低声地议论着：
      “多漂亮，多可爱，这一群小天使！”
      “为了保卫他们，我水里钻，火里跳，也都乐意！”
    海军战士们和少先队员们，迅速地融和在一起了。他们手拉着手，一齐跳舞、唱歌。嘹亮的歌声在海面回旋。军舰，就载着歌舞，载着幸福和欢乐，向祖国美丽的海洋进发。
    大炮，机器，仪器，海上的帆船，隐约可见的岛屿，随着军舰忽上忽下盘旋飞舞的海鸥，这一切，都有力地吸引着孩子们。各种各样的问题不断地提出来，水兵们耐心地热情地讲解着。
      “叔叔，那是什么？”一位小朋友指着在海面摇幌不停的浮标惊奇地问。
      “那是海上的人民警察！”主炮二班长高全发笑着回答。“你们在陆地上不是常看见十字路口有人民警察伸开两臂，指挥车辆行驶吗？我们海上就有这一个个浮标担负人民警察的工作，给我们指示航行的方向，使我们的舰船不致触礁，遇险，它的功劳可大哩！”
    小朋友禁不住高兴得一齐鼓起掌来，他们把手举到头顶，大声地呼喊着：
    “海上的人民警察，我们向你致敬！”
    国际小友人们，虽然言语不通，但是，他们还是热情地把水兵们拉到一边，滔滔不绝地讲述着，他们用手势用微笑来表达自己的感情。保加利亚的一位名叫莉达的小姑娘，她把轮机五班长安玉麟拉到自己身边，向他学习几句简单的中国话，然后又照着他的胸章，把
  “中国人民解放军”几个字一笔一划地抄在自己的小本子上。来自越南的十三岁的小朋友黎光养，是个曾经三次被敌人逮捕而始终不屈的少年游击队的英雄。现在，他举起两个小拳头，口里喊着：“毛泽东！胡志明！”然后，又把两个拳头紧紧地合在一起，用力往下打。再也不需要用言语来补充。海军战士们都被他感动了。
    水兵王者彦，正在给一群小朋友讲解大炮，他身子向前倾，两手往上一推，嘴巴张开：“嘡嘡嘡，嘡嘡嘡……”就活像一门大炮。孩子们围绕着他，抬起小脸，睁着乌亮亮的眼睛，听得出神。一位名叫向家经的小朋友，戴上一顶水兵帽，爬到炮手座位上，紧紧抱着大炮不肯放手，他说：
    “我要当一个小炮手，打美国鬼子！”
    这纯真的话，引得水兵们哈哈大笑。
    军舰在祖国辽阔的海洋上迎风破浪不停地前进着，指挥台上，围着红领巾的宋舰长，注视着航向，时而给值更长下达一个命令，时而又向着在甲板上旋转的少先队员们招手。这时候，他身后忽然传来一个尖细嗓子的声音：“报告舰长同志，我可以上来吗？”
    嘿，真有意思，一个小朋友正攀在指挥台的边沿上想上来哩！需要扶他一把啊！宋舰长连忙把他抱了起来，又疼又爱地问：“你叫什么名字？几岁啦？”
    小朋友挣脱了舰长的怀抱，拍的一个立正，行了一个队礼：“报告舰长同志！我叫朱惠敏，十岁零三个月，我将来要参加海军，当一名水兵！”
    宋舰长点点头说：“将来准是一名优秀的水兵，来，现在就来见习一下！”说着，就把一副望远镜挂到小朋友的胸前，慈爱地指点着，考问着：
  “你在前面看见什么？你在左面看见什么？你在右面看见什么？”
    小朋友一会儿数着片片渔帆，一会儿又探寻着前面的岛屿，他回答着舰长提出的各个问题，满意地快乐地跳跃着说：“真清楚，真清楚，我的眼睛也变亮啦！”
    少先队员们热爱祖国的海洋，他们喜爱海上的
  一切，他们真愿意生活在海上哩！一位来自贵州高原地带的苗族小朋友杨希明，拉着一位水兵的手，恳切地问道：
      “叔叔，当海军要做哪些准备？”
    那位水兵笑嘻嘻地、不慌不忙地说：“要当海军吗？那么，就要准备这些：高度的政治觉悟和文化科学知识，坚强的意志，健康的身体，活泼的情绪。”
    小朋友迅速从口袋里掏出一个小本子，把水兵说的话一字一句地记下来。一面又自言自语地说：“当海军真光荣，但也真不容易。”
    水兵连忙补充了一句：“当海军要求很高，这的确是不容易的；但是，如果有决心……。”
    小朋友还没等水兵把话说完，就用小拳头捶打着小本子，不住口地说：“我有决心，我有决心，我一定照着这些条件去准备。”
    小朋友们都争着向海军叔叔讲述自己的理想和志愿，他们有的想当工程师，有的想当农业家，有的想当国防战士，有一位名叫田绍文的小朋友说：“我有三个志愿：第一个是当炼钢工人；第二个是当拖拉机手；第三个，当需要保卫祖国的时候，当一名坦克手，一直向敌人冲去！”
    每一个海军战士都为孩子们的理想和愿望所深深感动。枪炮兵于敬课，把一群少先队员拉到自己的胸前来，他兴奋得几乎要冒泪花了。他回忆起自己的少年时代，他的少年时代是在鞭笞和辛酸中度过的。他用亲切的眼光注视着祖国新生的幸福的一代，并用他粗大健壮的手抚摸着孩子们的头，激动地说：
    “小朋友，你们放心大胆地去为自己的理想努力奋斗吧！这里，有我们保卫着你们！”
    归航了。军舰靠码头后，水兵们还和少先队员们跳了一个大团结舞，高唱着“团结就是力量！”从甲板上一直跳到码头上。分离了，但是，海军战士们和少先队员们的心是永远联结在一起的。海军战士们的纪念册上写满了小朋友们的感激和期望。
    ——亲爱的海军叔叔，是你们守卫着祖国的大门，使我们能安心学习，每晚上都睡得很甜，每顿饭都吃得很香！
    ——你们是幸福的靠山！你们是我们的榜样！
    ——别让美国鬼子来破坏我们的幸福，你们要提高警惕，不论是从空中飞过一只鸟，还是从海上飘过一根草，都请叔叔们仔细瞧一瞧！
   ——希望你们为解放台湾，拯救台湾千千万万的小朋友而努力！
    我们一定要保卫祖国未来的建设者和保卫者！保卫祖国的和平和幸福！当挥着小白帽的少先队员们渐渐远去的时候，海军战士们的这个决心和信念更加坚定了。（附图片）
