    An Outstanding Fighter for Peace, Democracy, and Socialism
    —Congratulations to Comrade Eugene Dennis on His Fiftieth Birthday
    Wu Zhang, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Today, August 10th, is the fiftieth birthday of Comrade Eugene Dennis, an outstanding fighter of the American working class and people, and General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States.
    Due to the illegal persecution by the reactionary authorities of the United States, Comrade Dennis is unable to celebrate his birthday among his comrades and friends, but instead spends this day in the gloomy federal prison in Atlanta, USA. However, the prisons of the American reactionaries cannot separate Comrade Dennis from the broad masses of the people. Today, the Chinese people, the people of the United States, and all progressive and kind people around the world are closely concerned about Comrade Dennis, warmly congratulating him on his fiftieth birthday, and extending to him heartfelt condolences and respect.
    Comrade Dennis was sentenced to five years in prison by the reactionary authorities of the United States in June 1951 under the fascist Smith Act. Before that, because he accused the "Un-American Activities Investigation Committee," which engaged in espionage activities, of violating the U.S. Constitution, he was charged with "contempt" of Congress and served nearly a year in the New York City Federal Detention Center. However, everyone knows that these charges against Comrade Dennis by the reactionary authorities of the United States are completely untenable. In fact, the only crime shared by Comrade Dennis and his comrades lies in their infinite loyalty to the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism; in their heroic opposition to the notorious McCarthyist fascist oppression in the United States; in their opposition to war propaganda and arms expansion and preparations for war, and in their opposition to American warmongers threatening the safety and happiness of other countries and all mankind.
    As an outstanding son of the American people, Comrade Dennis has dedicated his entire life to the struggle of the American working class and people. Comrade Dennis was born into a working-class family in 1904 and joined the ranks of the workers' movement very early. In his youth, he worked as a lumberjack, electrician, and dock worker. In order to fight for the living rights of the working class, he led the joint strike struggle of dock workers in California as early as 1920. In the dark days of the 1930s, despite the terrorist high-pressure tactics adopted by the American monopoly capital group against the workers' movement, Comrade Dennis steadfastly and successfully organized agricultural workers, sailors, and unemployed workers in Southern California. On March 6, 1930, he led a large demonstration of unemployed workers, writing a glorious page in the history of the American labor movement. During these arduous struggles, Comrade Dennis has always shown himself to be an outstanding organizer of the American Communist Party and the working class, and a propagandist of socialist theory.
    During World War II, Comrade Dennis implemented the party's policy and carried out a great deal of work to unite the people of the whole country and support the anti-fascist war. In 1945, under the leadership of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, headed by Comrade Foster, Comrade Dennis actively participated in the struggle to thoroughly liquidate the Browder revisionism of the anti-Party elements. Since then, Comrade Dennis has served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States.
    After World War II, the American monopoly capital group attempted to seize world hegemony, implement arms expansion and war preparations, carry out foreign aggression, instigate new wars, and at the same time promulgated a series of reactionary bills to strengthen the fascization of the United States, causing serious attacks on the democratic rights and living rights of the American working class and the broad masses of the people. Under such circumstances, the Communist Party of the United States and all peaceful democratic forces in the United States relentlessly exposed the extremely anti-people nature of the domestic and foreign policies of the American ruling group, and, together with the broad masses of the people, launched a just struggle to defend the cause of peace and democracy. It is precisely because Comrade Dennis and his comrades are at the forefront of this struggle that they have been subjected to the barbaric hatred and persecution of the American reactionaries.
    In 1949, the American reactionary group launched a nationwide persecution campaign against the American peaceful democratic forces. Judge Medina of the New York Federal Court illegally tried Comrade Dennis and other leaders of the American Communist Party, Benjamin J. Davis, John Gates, John Williamson, Henry Winston, Robert Thompson, Carl Winter, Jack Stachel, Gus Hall, Gilbert Green, and Irving Potash. They foolishly wanted to declare the theory of Marxism-Leninism illegal, and wanted to slander the just struggle of the Communist Party of the United States for peace, democracy, and social progress as a "treasonous" conspiracy, but this slander has long been refuted by the entire history of the Communist Party of the United States and countless facts. The American reactionary authorities threw Comrade Dennis and his comrades into prison on trumped-up charges, which only proves that this self-proclaimed "free" country and "leader of the free world" is inheriting Hitler's fascist mantle.
    Throughout the trial, Comrade Dennis and his comrades brilliantly defended the Party and the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and powerfully exposed the conspiracies of the American reactionaries against peace and the people in the reactionary court. Comrade Dennis pointed out that all the activities of the Communist Party of the United States in the more than 30 years since its establishment have been to defend the vital interests of the American people, especially the American working class, and to fight for occupational insurance, improve living standards, and oppose fascism. Therefore, the indictment cannot say the specific actions and exact dates of the so-called "treason" committed by the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States. The purpose of the American monopoly capital group and its agents in arranging this illegal trial is to seek a "'theoretical basis'—a 'theoretical basis' that serves Wall Street's 'Cold War,' 'tough policy toward the Soviet Union,' massive arms race, atomic diplomacy, and preparations for launching a new world war." Comrade Dennis exposed it sharply, giving the American reactionaries a serious blow, so that Judge Medina did not dare to include part of Comrade Dennis' defense in the trial record.
    Comrade Dennis has been illegally imprisoned for three years. In the United States, the status of political prisoners is not recognized. Comrade Dennis has suffered all kinds of torture in the Atlanta U.S. Federal Penitentiary, and even his freedom to read, meet guests, write, and write letters has been unreasonably restricted. Due to the harsh living conditions, Comrade Dennis's health has been seriously damaged. He has undergone two major operations, but the American reactionary authorities have refused to allow his private doctor to treat him, forcing him to live in the prison hospital with crude medical facilities. However, like countless communists and freedom fighters, Comrade Dennis stands tall and fearless in the reactionary prison. His heroism, his spirit of upholding the truth, and his firm belief in the inevitable victory of the cause of justice have given the American reactionary forces a relentless counterattack and given the American people who are fighting for peace and freedom a powerful encouragement. All upright people believe that justice belongs to Comrade Dennis and his comrades, and express their respect for them.
    Since illegally imprisoning Comrade Dennis and the other ten leaders of the Communist Party of the United States, the American ruling group has intensified its adoption of various fascist measures to persecute other communists and progressives, attempting to suppress the growing workers' movement and peace movement in the United States. The US Congress has formulated more and more reactionary fascist bills. The "Un-American Activities Investigation Committee," the "Federal Bureau of Investigation" and other police and judicial organs have become increasingly rampant in fabricating unfounded charges such as "subversive activities" and "espionage conspiracies" to persecute all people with democratic ideas and peaceful aspirations. Some states have declared the Communist Party illegal, and government agencies and enterprises have unreasonably fired all communists and those they consider sympathetic to communism. Not only have dozens of leaders of the American Communist Party been arrested and imprisoned, but also many upright writers, scientists, and artists have been subjected to various forms of political persecution.
    The American rulers believe that by using these fascist terror tactics such as investigation, arrest, imprisonment, deportation, and even electrocution, they can weaken the influence of the Communist Party among the masses, suppress the people's struggle for peace and democracy, and create all kinds of war propaganda to deceive the people, so as to launch a new war of aggression. However, the American ruling group has miscalculated. Their cruel persecution of the Communist Party of the United States and other peaceful democratic people has not achieved the results they hoped for. Although Comrade Dennis and other leaders of the American Communist Party are imprisoned, the Communist Party of the United States still adheres to the struggle; the American peace and democracy movement is growing. The heroic deeds of the glorious peace fighters, the Rosenbergs, who sacrificed heroically for peace, brilliantly demonstrate that the American people's will for peace and freedom is invincible.
    For several years, the American people have never stopped protesting against the US government's persecution of the leaders of the American Communist Party, and have never stopped the movement to rescue Comrade Dennis and other comrades. Dennis and other comrades in prison have won more and more widespread sympathy and support from the American people. The words of the famous American writer Rodell in a letter of condolence fully reflect the voice of the vast number of conscientious Americans. He wrote: "Your words and deeds are louder and more lasting than the slanders of those slanderers, and prove that you are the best patriots because you are fighting for all mankind... When the Foley Square trial was going on, I was one of the many silent people. Now, I express my protest for you. Many people—those Americans who still have faith in America's past and future—have been awakened by you. Please include me among these people." The American people have regarded the demand to restore the freedom of Comrade Dennis and other leaders of the American Communist Party as part of the struggle to defend democratic rights, and as the fascist rule in the United States intensifies, this struggle is becoming increasingly high.
    At the same time, the American workers' movement and peace movement are also constantly expanding and strengthening. In order to defend their vital rights, the American working class has launched more and more courageous strike struggles, and is more and more closely combining them with the struggle to defend peace. The ranks of the American people defending peace are constantly expanding and consolidating. Their struggle to demand an end to the Korean War and to oppose American intervention in the Indochina War has played a great role in combating American aggression. Now, they are continuing to fight against the American reactionary group's conspiracy to launch a new war, and to strive for friendly cooperation between the people of all countries and the peaceful coexistence of all countries in the world. As Comrade Dennis said in prison, the American people firmly believe that "the ending is not destined. The intervention of the people can still change reality and can still break through the greatest disaster for our people—another world war."
    Comrade Dennis and his comrades have always been deeply concerned about the revolutionary and construction cause of the Chinese people, and about the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people. A small handful of American reactionary ruling groups are frantically hostile to the Chinese people who have stood up, stubbornly pursue a policy of aggression against the People's Republic of China, and desperately obstruct and undermine the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and American people. This practice is fundamentally incompatible with the wishes of the American people. The Communist Party of the United States, all peaceful democratic forces, and millions of Americans unswervingly demand the continuous development and enhancement of the friendship between the Chinese and American people. This demand cannot be stopped by any reactionary force.
    The American people are not isolated. The Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world resolutely support the just struggle of the American people to strive for peace, democracy, and freedom, oppose the war and fascist policies of the American ruling group, demand the restoration of the freedom of Comrade Dennis and other leaders of the Communist Party of the United States, and stop all persecution of progressive forces in the United States. We believe that the joint efforts of the Chinese people, the American people, and the people of all countries will further strengthen the friendly relations between the people of all countries and contribute to the cause of world peace.

    为和平民主和社会主义而斗争的杰出战士
    ——祝贺尤金·丹尼斯同志五十寿辰
    中国共产党中央委员会委员　吴玉章
    今天——八月十日，是美国工人阶级和人民的杰出战士、美国共产党总书记尤金·丹尼斯同志的五十寿辰。
    由于美国反动当局的非法迫害，丹尼斯同志竟不能够在他的同志们和朋友们中间欢庆他的生日，而是在美国亚特兰大城的阴森森的联邦监狱中度过这一天。然而，美国反动派的监狱并不能把丹尼斯同志和广大人民分隔开。今天，中国人民，美国和全世界的一切进步的善良的人民，都在亲切地关怀着丹尼斯同志，热烈地祝贺他的五十寿辰，并向他致以衷心的慰问和敬意。
    丹尼斯同志是在一九五一年六月被美国反动当局根据法西斯的史密斯法判处五年徒刑的。在这以前，因为他指斥进行特务活动的“非美活动调查委员会”违反美国宪法，曾被加以“蔑视”国会罪，在纽约市联邦法院监狱受过近一年的徒刑。但是，谁都知道，美国反动当局迫害丹尼斯同志的这些罪名，是根本站不住脚的。事实上，丹尼斯同志和他的战友们所共有的唯一罪名就在于他们对和平、民主与社会主义事业的无限忠诚；就在于他们英勇地反对美国臭名远扬的麦卡锡主义的法西斯压迫；就在于他们反对战争宣传和扩军备战，反对美国战争贩子威胁其他国家和全人类的安全与幸福。
    作为美国人民的优秀儿子，丹尼斯同志把他的全部生活都献给了美国工人阶级和人民的斗争。丹尼斯同志在一九○四年出生于工人家庭，很早就参加到工人运动的行列里来。在青年时代，他当过伐木工人、电气工人、码头工人。为了争取工人阶级的生活权利，还在一九二○年，他就领导了加利福尼亚州码头工人的联合罢工斗争。在三十年代的黑暗日子里，尽管美国垄断资本集团对工人运动采取恐怖的高压手段，但是丹尼斯同志还是坚定而成功地把南加利福尼亚的农业工人、海员和失业工人组织了起来。一九三○年三月六日，他领导了失业工人的大示威，在美国劳工运动史上写下了光辉的一页。丹尼斯同志在这些艰苦斗争的日子里，一直表现出他是美国共产党和工人阶级的卓越的组织家和社会主义理论的宣传家。
    第二次世界大战期间，丹尼斯同志执行党的政策，为团结全国人民，支援反法西斯战争，进行了许多工作。一九四五年，在以福斯特同志为首的美国共产党全国委员会领导下，丹尼斯同志积极参加了彻底清算反党分子白劳德修正主义的斗争。从那时以后，丹尼斯同志便一直担任美国共产党的总书记。
    第二次世界大战以后，美国垄断资本集团妄图夺取世界霸权，实行扩军备战，进行对外侵略，挑拨新战争，同时颁布一系列的反动法案，加强美国的法西斯化，使美国工人阶级和广大人民的民主权利和生活权利遭到了严重的进攻。在这种情况下，美国共产党和美国一切和平民主力量，无情地揭露了美国统治集团内外政策的极端反人民的本质，并和广大人民一道，展开了保卫和平民主事业的正义斗争。正是因为丹尼斯同志和他的战友们是站在这个斗争的最前列，因而遭到了美国反动派的野蛮仇视和迫害。
    一九四九年，美国反动集团对美国和平民主力量发动了全国规模的迫害行动。美国纽约联邦法院麦迪纳法官对丹尼斯同志及其他美共领袖本杰明·杰·戴维斯，约翰·盖兹，约翰·威廉逊，亨利·温斯顿，罗伯特·汤普逊，卡尔·温特，杰克·斯塔彻，葛斯·霍尔，吉伯特·格林和欧文·鲍达希诸同志开始了非法审讯。他们愚蠢地想把马克思列宁主义的理论宣布为非法，想污蔑美国共产党为争取和平、民主与社会进步而进行的正义斗争为“叛国”阴谋，但是这种污蔑早就被美国共产党的全部历史和无数事实所驳倒了。美国反动当局以莫须有的罪名把丹尼斯同志和他的战友们投入监狱，不过证明了这个自命是所谓“自由”国家和“自由世界的领导者”，正在继承着希特勒的法西斯衣钵。
    丹尼斯同志和他的战友们在整个审讯过程中，光辉地捍卫了党和马克思列宁主义理论，并在反动派的法庭上，有力地揭露了美国反动派反和平反人民的阴谋。丹尼斯同志指出，美国共产党成立三十多年以来的一切活动，就是为保卫美国人民，首先是美国工人阶级的切身利益，为职业保险、改善生活水平，反对法西斯主义而奋斗。因此起诉状根本说不出美国共产党领袖们犯过所谓“叛国”罪的具体行动和确切的日期。美国垄断资本集团及其代理人所以要布置这个非法审讯的目的，是在于寻求一个“‘理论基础’——一个为华尔街的‘冷战’，‘对苏联采取强硬政策’，大规模的军备竞赛，原子弹外交以及发动新世界大战的准备工作服务的‘理论基础’”。丹尼斯同志一针见血的予以揭斥，给了美国反动派以严重打击，以致麦迪纳法官不敢把丹尼斯同志的一部分辩护词列入审讯记录。
    丹尼斯同志被非法监禁已经三年了。在美国，政治犯的地位是不被承认的。丹尼斯同志在亚特兰大美国联邦监狱中受尽了种种磨折，他连读书、会客、写作和写信的自由都横遭无理限制。由于生活条件恶劣，丹尼斯同志的健康受到严重损害，他曾施行过两次大手术，而美国反动当局竟不许他的私人医生为他诊病，强迫他住在医药设备鄙陋的监狱医院中。但是，正同无数共产党人和自由战士一样，丹尼斯同志在反动派的监狱中像巨人般昂然屹立而毫无畏惧。他所表现的英雄气概，坚持真理的精神和对于正义事业必然胜利的坚定信心，给了美国反动势力以无情的回击，给了为和平与自由而斗争的美国人民以有力鼓舞。一切正直人民都认为正义是属于丹尼斯同志和他的战友们一边，并对他们表示崇敬。
    美国统治集团自从把丹尼斯同志和其他十位美国共产党领袖非法监禁在狱中以后，又变本加厉地采取各种法西斯措施，以迫害其他共产党人和进步人士，企图镇压在美国国内日益增长的工人运动和和平运动。美国国会制定了一项比一项更反动的法西斯法案，“非美活动调查委员会”、“联邦调查局”等和其他警察、司法机关愈来愈猖獗地捏造什么“颠覆活动”、“间谍阴谋”等无稽的罪名，来迫害一切具有民主思想和和平愿望的人民。有些州宣布了共产党为非法，政府机关和企业无理解雇一切共产党人和被他们认为是同情共产主义的人。不仅是好几十位美共的领袖被捕下狱，而且许许多多正直的作家、科学家、艺术家也遭到各种各样的政治迫害。
    美国统治者以为使用这些调查、逮捕、监禁、驱逐出境甚至电刑等法西斯恐怖手段，就可以削弱共产党在人民群众中的影响，就可以压制人民争取和平与民主的斗争，就可以制造种种战争宣传来欺骗人民，以便发动新的侵略战争。但是，美国统治集团的算盘打错了。他们对美国共产党和其他和平民主人士进行的残酷迫害并没有收到他们所希望的效果。丹尼斯同志和其他美共领袖虽被监禁狱中，美国共产党仍然坚持着斗争；美国和平民主运动正在日益增长。光荣的和平战士罗森堡夫妇为和平而英勇牺牲的事迹，就光辉地表现了美国人民的和平自由意志是不可战胜的。
    几年以来，美国人民从来没有停止过抗议美国政府迫害美共领袖的罪行，没有停止过营救丹尼斯等同志的运动。丹尼斯和其他在狱中的同志获得了美国人民愈来愈广泛的同情和支持。美国名作家罗德尔在他的一封慰问信中的话，充分反映了广大有良心的美国人的心声。他写道：“你们的言辞和行动比那些诽谤者的造谣中伤更加响亮，更加持久，而且证明你们是最优秀的爱国者，因为你们是为全人类而战斗……当福莱广场审讯在进行的时候，我是许多沉默者之中的一个。现在，我为你们而表示我的抗议，许多人——那些仍旧对美国的过去和未来怀着信心的美国的人被你们唤醒了，请把我列在这些人的中间。”美国人民已把要求恢复丹尼斯同志和其他美共领袖的自由看作是保卫民主权利的斗争的一个部分，随着美国法西斯统治的日益加强，这一斗争是愈来愈高涨了。
    同时，美国的工人运动与和平运动也是正在不断地扩大和加强。美国的工人阶级为了捍卫自己的切身权利，掀起了愈来愈勇猛的罢工斗争，而且愈来愈紧密地和保卫和平的斗争结合起来。美国人民保卫和平的队伍不断地扩大和巩固，他们为要求停止朝鲜战争和反对美国干涉印度支那战争而展开的斗争，在打击美国侵略政策中起了很大的作用。现在，他们正在继续为反对美国反动集团发动新战争阴谋，为争取各国人民之间的友好合作与世界各国的和平共处而斗争。正如丹尼斯同志在狱中所说的，美国人民坚信“结局并不是注定了的。人民的干预仍然可以改变现实，仍然可以把我们人民最大的灾难——再一次的世界战争冲破。”
    丹尼斯同志和他的战友们一直深切地关怀着中国人民的革命事业和建设事业，关怀着中美两国人民之间的传统友谊。一小撮美国反动统治集团疯狂地仇视站起来了的中国人民，顽固地执行侵略中华人民共和国的政策，拼命阻挠和破坏中美两国人民之间的友好合作，这种做法是和美国人民的愿望根本不相容的。美国共产党、一切和平民主力量以及千百万的美国人民，坚持不渝地要求不断地发展和增进中美两国人民之间的友谊。这个要求是任何反动势力所不可能阻挡的。
    美国人民并不是孤立的，中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都坚决支持美国人民争取和平民主与自由，反对美国统治集团的战争和法西斯政策，要求恢复丹尼斯同志和其他美国共产党领袖的自由，停止对美国进步力量的一切迫害的正义斗争。我们相信，中国人民、美国人民、和世界各国人民共同努力，就会进一步加强各国人民之间的友好关系，并有助于世界和平事业。
