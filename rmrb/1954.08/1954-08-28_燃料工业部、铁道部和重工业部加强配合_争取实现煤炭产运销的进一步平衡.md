    Fuel Industry Ministry, Railway Ministry, and Heavy Industry Ministry Strengthen Cooperation
    Striving for Further Balance in Coal Production, Transportation, and Sales
    The Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the major coal users under the Central People's Government, have strengthened cooperation, playing a significant role in ensuring further balance in the national coal production, transportation, and sales.
    In the past, the national coal production, transportation, and sales were basically balanced, but instances of untimely railway car supply or coal mines failing to produce according to plan, as well as coal users failing to unload cars on time, still occurred frequently. This not only caused coal stockpiles but also often affected railway transportation plans and user coal consumption plans. In light of this situation, the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Ministry of Railways signed the "Agreement on Resolving Coal Transportation Issues" in May of this year and established a joint office to directly oversee the coal transportation work of their respective mining bureaus and stations. The Ministry of Heavy Industry also participated in the work of the joint office to negotiate solutions to unloading issues. After the establishment of the joint office, the three departments promptly exchanged information on coal production, transportation, and usage, and understood each other's work characteristics, so that many disputed issues could be resolved quickly, effectively eliminating certain disconnects in coal production, transportation, and sales. For example, in mid-May, the Hegang Mining Bureau experienced a large backlog of coal due to insufficient car supply. After the joint office studied the situation, the railway department allocated an additional batch of cars, resolving the issue in a timely manner. In the past, Anshan Iron and Steel Company was often late in unloading cars, often occupying a large number of cars. After joint research by the joint office, the Ministry of Heavy Industry instructed Anshan Iron and Steel to improve the unloading work, significantly reducing the phenomenon of car congestion.

    燃料工业部、铁道部和重工业部加强配合
    争取实现煤炭产运销的进一步平衡
    中央人民政府燃料工业部、铁道部和主要用煤户重工业部加强了相互间的协作，对于保证全国煤炭生产、运输、销售三方面的进一步平衡起了很大作用。
    过去，全国煤炭生产、运输、销售三方面基本上是平衡的，但铁路车皮供应不及时或煤矿不按计划生产，以及用煤户不按时卸车等情形还是经常发生。这样不仅使煤炭积压，也常常影响铁路运输计划和用户用煤计划。根据这一情况，中央燃料工业部和铁道部今年五月间签订了“关于解决煤炭运输问题的协议书”，并成立了联合办公室，直接指挥所属矿务局和车站有关煤炭运输的各项工作。中央重工业部也参加了联合办公室的工作，以便协商解决卸车方面的问题。成立联合办公室后，三个部门及时交流煤炭生产、运输、使用方面的情况，了解彼此工作上的特点，因而许多争执的问题都能迅速得到处理，有效地消除了煤炭生产、运输和销售三方面某些脱节现象。如鹤岗矿务局五月中旬因车皮供应不足，使煤炭大量积压。联合办公室研究了这一情况后，由铁路部门增拨了一批车皮，及时解决了这一问题。鞍山钢铁公司过去卸车不及时，常常占用大量车皮。经过联合办公室共同研究，由重工业部指示鞍钢改进了卸车工作，使车皮堵塞的现象显著减少。　（新华社）
