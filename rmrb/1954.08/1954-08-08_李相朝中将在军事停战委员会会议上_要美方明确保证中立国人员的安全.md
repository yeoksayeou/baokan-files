Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. At the suggestion of the Korean and Chinese side, the Military Armistice Commission held its 46th meeting on August 6 to discuss new developments in a series of serious violations of the armistice agreement in South Korea under US military control, endangering and threatening the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) personnel and their work. It also addressed the August 4 letter from the NNSC to the Military Armistice Commission requesting relevant guarantees from the US side.

At the meeting, Li Xiangchao pointed out: When the Korean and Chinese side strongly protested in the Military Armistice Commission meeting on August 3 against the above-mentioned series of threats and violent acts by the US side against the NNSC personnel, the US side claimed that it was willing to fulfill its responsibilities to the NNSC. However, at the same time, the US side was conducting open threats against the NNSC in Daegu, South Korea. On August 4, all members of the NNSC jointly sent a letter to the Military Armistice Commission, requesting the US authorities to take full and effective measures to ensure the safety of the NNSC personnel and the normal work of the NNSC inspection teams, and to punish the masterminds and murderers in each incident. However, in its letter to the NNSC on August 4, the US side still refused to give a clear and affirmative reply. It is especially noteworthy that US Secretary of State Dulles publicly slandered the NNSC on August 3, supported the illegal violent actions currently taking place in areas under US control, and clamored for the abolition of the NNSC. Subsequently, the police authorities in the US-controlled areas openly threatened to take further persecutory actions against the NNSC inspection team personnel. This not only demonstrates the seriousness of the current situation developing in the US-controlled areas, but also fully exposes the US side as a direct accomplice in these violent acts. While paying lip service to protecting and assisting the NNSC, it actually does not take effective measures and practical actions to fulfill its obligations clearly stipulated in the armistice agreement to stop such illegal acts. The US reply to the NNSC on August 4 also contained no specific responsible statement.

Li Xiangchao then pointed out: In order for the NNSC to be able to perform its duties and tasks stipulated in the armistice agreement, the Military Armistice Commission, as the body supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement, should immediately give a responsible reply to the NNSC's letter of August 4. The US side should specifically and clearly guarantee: immediately take full and effective measures to stop all threats and violent actions to ensure the safety of the NNSC personnel in the US-controlled areas, and that the NNSC can perform its duties and tasks without threat or hindrance; immediately severely punish all masterminds and murderers in each incident, and effectively ensure that no such incidents occur again in the US-controlled areas, and thoroughly implement all provisions of the armistice agreement relating to the NNSC.

At the meeting on August 6, the US side only once again claimed that it was willing to fulfill its obligations stipulated in the armistice agreement, but groundlessly refused to make specific and clear guarantees to the NNSC.

Li Xiangchao immediately pointed out: Now, the NNSC is encountering great difficulties in performing its duties and tasks in the US-controlled areas. Disregarding the legitimate demands put forward by the NNSC, the US side refuses to fulfill all the obligations stipulated in the armistice agreement, and stubbornly refuses to take effective measures and provide clear guarantees regarding the serious situation in the US-controlled areas, which fully shows that the US side is determined to continue these threats and violent acts, attempting to use this to undermine the provisions of the armistice agreement concerning the NNSC, freely, massively, and illegally bring in military reinforcements, deepen the instability of the Korean armistice, and create tension in Asia. This attitude and action of the US side, and the above-mentioned remarks by US Secretary of State Dulles, which were hostile to the NNSC and openly clamored for the abolition of the NNSC, are closely echoing and planned actions.

Li Xiangchao finally pointed out: The various clauses concerning the NNSC are an inseparable part of the armistice agreement and must not be undermined in any way. The US side has an unavoidable responsibility to provide clear guarantees regarding the safety of the NNSC and the performance of its duties and tasks in the US-controlled areas. Regarding the current serious situation in the US-controlled areas, the Korean and Chinese side is still closely watching every step of its development.

    李相朝中将在军事停战委员会会议上
    要美方明确保证中立国人员的安全
    【新华社开城七日电】军事停战委员会八月六日在朝中方面建议下举行第四十六次会议，讨论在美方军事控制下的南朝鲜各地最近发生的危害及威胁中立国监察委员会人员及工作的一系列严重违反停战协定的事件的新的发展，以及八月四日中立国监察委员会就此致函军事停战委员会要求美方提出有关的保证的问题。
    李相朝中将在会上指出：朝中方面在八月三日军事停战委员会会议上强硬抗议上述美方对中立国监察委员会人员所进行的一系列威胁与暴力行为时，美方曾声称愿履行其对于中立国监察委员会所已承担的责任。但与此同时，美方却在南朝鲜的大邱进行对中立国监察委员会的公开威胁的行动。八月四日，中立国监察委员会全体委员联名致函军事停战委员会，要求美方当局采取充分有效措施，保证中立国监察委员会人员的安全以及中立国视察小组的正常工作，并惩罚各该事件中的主谋和凶手，但美方在八月四日给中立国监察委员会的信中却仍拒绝给予明确的肯定的答复。尤其值得注意的是：美国国务卿杜勒斯在八月三日公开对中立国监察委员会进行诬蔑，支持目前正在美方控制地区内进行着的那些非法暴力行动，并叫嚣取消中立国监察委员会。接着美方控制地区内的警察当局又公开恫吓，要对中立国视察小组人员采取进一步的迫害行动，这不仅说明了目前正在美方控制地区发展着的局势的严重性，而且充分暴露了美方是这些暴力行为的直接同谋者。它虽空谈保护与协助中立国监察委员会，而实际并不采取有效措施和实际行动来履行停战协定所明文规定的义务，停止这种非法的行为。而八月四日美方答复中立国监察委员会的信里也没有任何具体的负责表示。
    李相朝中将接着指出：为使中立国监察委员会能够执行停战协定所规定的职司与任务，作为监督停战协定实施的机构的军事停战委员会，应立即对中立国监察委员会八月四日的来信作负责的答复，由美方具体而明确地保证：立即采取充分有效的措施停止一切威胁和暴力行动，以保证在美方控制地区内的中立国监察委员会的人员的安全和中立国监察委员会能够不受威胁和不受阻碍地执行其职司与任务；立即严惩各该事件中所有的主谋和凶手，切实保证美方控制地区内不再发生任何此类事件，彻底执行停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的全部条款。
    美方在八月六日会议上，仅又一次声称它愿履行停战协定所规定的义务，但又说不出任何理由地始终拒绝向中立国监察委员会提出具体的、明确的保证。
    李相朝中将当即指出：现在，中立国监察委员会在美方控制地区内执行其职司与任务时，正遭遇到极大的困难。美方竟不顾中立国监察委员会所提出的正当要求，拒绝履行停战协定所规定的全部义务，对目前在美方控制地区内的严重情况，固执地拒绝采取有效措施和提供明确的保证，这充分说明了美方决心继续这种威胁和暴力行为，企图借此破坏停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的条款，放手、大量、非法地运进军事增援，加深朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，制造亚洲的紧张局势。美方这种态度和行动，和美国国务卿杜勒斯上述敌视中立国监察委员会并公开叫嚣取消中立国监察委员会的谈话是紧密地相互呼应的、有计划的行动。
    李相朝中将最后指出：有关中立国监察委员会各条款是停战协定中的不可分割的一部分，绝不容许任何破坏。美方有不可避免的责任就中立国监察委员会在美方控制地区的安全和执行职司与任务提供明确的保证。对于目前美方地区内的严重情况，朝中方面仍在密切注视其每一步的发展。
