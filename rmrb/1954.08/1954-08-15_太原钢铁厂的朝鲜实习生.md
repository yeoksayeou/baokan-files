Taiyuan Steel Plant's Korean Interns

The second group of interns from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, who recently arrived at the Taiyuan Steel Plant for training in our country, have now been assigned to departments such as steelmaking, sheet metal, and cold casting for their internships. Although the Chinese and Korean workers do not speak the same language, they have demonstrated a spirit of internationalism, uniting in friendship and cooperation. Kim Kyung-man, the representative of the interns, stated that the interns will humbly learn from the Chinese workers. The staff of the Taiyuan Steel Plant view assisting the interns in learning technology as a concrete contribution to the "Resist America, Aid Korea" campaign and have developed a plan accordingly. Gao Deshan, the production team leader of the sheet metal department, said: "I will teach the Korean comrades the technology without reservation." This group of interns is the second to intern at the Taiyuan Steel Plant. The previous group has already returned to their homeland, and most of them have risen from People's Army soldiers, farmers, and students who originally lacked technical knowledge to workers with technical levels of grade five or six. Furthermore, nine have reached the technical level of grade seven or eight, and two have reached the level of a grade five technician. (Li Anda)

    太原钢铁厂的朝鲜实习生
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国派来我国实习的、最近到达太原钢铁厂的第二批实习生，现已分配到炼钢、薄板、冷铸等部实习。虽然中朝两国工人语言不通，他们却表现了团结友爱的国际主义精神。实习生代表金京万表示实习生将虚心向中国工人学习。太原钢铁厂职工把帮助实习生学习技术，看作是抗美援朝的具体工作，并订了计划。薄板部生产组长高德山说：我要毫不保留地把技术教给朝鲜同志。这批实习生是第二批到太原钢铁厂实习的。前一批已返回他们的祖国，他们大多由原来不懂技术的人民军战士、农民、学生，提高为五、六级技术水平的工人，且有九名达到七、八级技术水平，两名达到五级技术员水平。　（李安达）
