Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 24th (TASS): N. Polyanov commented on the US economic situation in the "Izvestia" international review column with an article entitled "Unfounded Optimism."

Polyanov wrote that American newspapers published a statement by US President Eisenhower on US economic activity, which, like other recent official documents of this nature published by the United States, was worded very optimistically. The statement even exceptionally emphasized that "the recent decline in economic activity" "has stopped" and that the "propaganda" about this decline is unfounded.

However, the President's deliberately reassuring tone is inconsistent with the facts contained in his statement, and even more inconsistent with the materials published in the American newspapers. Facts prove that the decline in industrial production that began in the summer of 1953 is still continuing. American newspapers have many indications that the President's statement is less an attempt to estimate the current state of the American economy, and more a "propaganda document" drafted by the Republican Party for the upcoming Congressional elections.

Polyanov went on to say that the head of the Economic Policy Committee of the Industrial Union Federation described the President's statement as an example of deliberate optimism, and cited many significant figures to refute his optimistic conclusions.

Polyanov said that in the past eleven months, the number of workers employed in manufacturing has been declining continuously, and is now nearly two million less than a year ago. By the end of July, 800,000 unemployed had exhausted their unemployment benefits. Currently, US steel production is 30% lower than last year's level, and the steel industry's operating rate is only 63% of its production capacity. The industrial production index fell from 124 in June to 117 in July.

Polyanov pointed out that an objective assessment of the US economic situation not only cannot be consistent with the "reassuring conclusions" of the US official statement, but is completely opposite to these conclusions. The American people are beginning to see that the militaristic foreign policy of the American ruling group not only cannot alleviate the signs of crisis in the American economy, but will make these signs even more serious.

    毫无根据的乐观
    ——苏联“消息报”评论美国经济状况的文章的摘要
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：纳·波利扬诺夫在“消息报”国际述评栏中以“毫无根据的乐观”为题评论美国的经济情况。
    波利扬诺夫写道，美国报纸刊载了美国总统艾森豪威尔关于美国经济活动的声明，像美国最近发表的其他这种性质的官方文件一样，措词非常乐观。这个声明竟然破格地强调指出：“最近经济活动的下降”“已经停止”，对这种下降的“宣传”是毫无根据的。
    但是，总统的这种故意安慰人心的语调和他声明中所包含的事实不相符合，更和美国报纸上所刊登的材料不相符合。事实证明，从一九五三年夏季开始的工业生产的减退仍在继续中。美国报纸上有着不少的暗示说明，总统的这个声明，与其说是企图对美国的经济现况作一个估计，还不如说是共和党为了即将举行的国会选举而拟就的“宣传文件”。
    波利扬诺夫接着谈到，产业工会联合会经济政策委员会的负责人把总统的声明说成是一个故意表示乐观的例子，并举出了许多很有意义的数字来驳斥他所下的乐观的结论。
    波利扬诺夫说，在过去十一个月中，制造业所雇用的工人数目不断下降，到现在已比一年前少了将近二百万。到七月底，八十万失业者已经用尽了他们的失业津贴。目前，美国的钢铁生产量比去年的水平降低了百分之三十，炼钢工业的开工率只为生产能力的百分之六十三。工业生产指数从六月的一百二十四降到了七月的一百一十七。
    波利扬诺夫指出，对美国经济状况的客观估计非但不能和美国官方声明的“安慰人心的结论”一致，而且是和这些结论完全相反的。美国人民正在开始看到，美国统治集团的军国主义外交政策非但不能减轻美国经济中的危机迹象，反而会使危机迹象更趋严重。
