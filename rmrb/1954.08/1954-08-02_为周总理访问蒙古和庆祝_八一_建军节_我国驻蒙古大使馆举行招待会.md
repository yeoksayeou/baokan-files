Under the wise leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government of the Mongolian People's Republic, with the assistance of the great Soviet Union, the Mongolian people have made great achievements in politics, economy, and culture in the past thirty years. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the great achievements made by their close neighbor, the Mongolian People's Republic, in all aspects.

The long-standing friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples has gained new development since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Now, economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two countries are becoming increasingly close. I am deeply convinced that the friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples will surely develop from generation to generation.

Please allow me to propose a toast:

To the prosperity and strength of the Mongolian People's Republic, to the health of Comrade Tsedenbal, Premier of the Mongolian People's Republic!

Mongolian Premier Yu. Tsedenbal delivered a speech, saying: Respected Premier Comrade! Dear Comrades and Friends!

At this grand banquet held in honor of your visit to Ulaanbaatar and the glorious 27th anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, please allow me, on behalf the government of the Mongolian People's Republic and the Central Committee of the Mongolian People’ Revolutionary party, and on behalf of the Mongolian people, to warmly and sincerely congratulate you, and through you, warmly and sincerely congratulate the great Chinese people and their government, to congratulate you on the great victories achieved in the cause of building a new, strong, people's China, to congratulate you on the glorious anniversary of the People's Liberation Army, to congratulate you on the new victory of the peaceful policy of the People's Republic of China. The convincing proof of the new victory of the peaceful policy of the People's Republic of China is its participation in the Geneva Conference and its significant contribution to the conference.

The Mongolian people, together with all progressive humanity, are heartily excited by the growth of the strength of their great neighbor, the People's Republic of China. Our people jubilantly celebrate the glorious anniversary of the People's Liberation Army, which faithfully defends the historical achievements of the Chinese people. A new type of relationship has been established between our two peoples, a new type of relationship between countries that originated from the great October Socialist Revolution and has been established among the peoples of the democratic camp.

The mutual assistance and cooperation between our two peoples is becoming increasingly strengthened. Due to the historical achievements made by our two peoples, the era in which our two peoples were deprived of their rights, suffered oppression, and lived in poverty is gone forever. The friendship between our two peoples is solid and unbreakable. Our two peoples, with the strong assistance of our great friend, the Soviet people, are confidently marching along the road to socialism.

We will always remember the solemn, warm, and sincere hospitality given to our government delegation during its visit to the People's Republic of China by the great Chinese people, the Chinese government headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, and you yourself, respected Premier Comrade.

We are sincerely pleased to see the great historical changes that have taken place in the lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese people due to the victory of the Chinese revolution.

We see everywhere in China the high enthusiasm of the powerful people and their huge potential strength, and we see many facts of their establishment of labor merits for the prosperity of the motherland and for the consolidation of world peace.

In celebrating the anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, it must be pointed out its long and heroic struggle, the struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party against our common enemy, Japanese imperialism, which struggle was a major support for consolidating the revolutionary fruits of our people.

Respected Premier! Your visit to our capital has great significance for the further development of the constantly strengthening friendly relations between our two peoples.

Please allow me to raise a glass in celebration of the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples, to celebrate the great Chinese people and their government, to celebrate the Chinese Communist Party, to celebrate the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army, to celebrate Comrade Mao Zedong, the long-tested leader of the Chinese Communist Party and a friend of our people!

During the reception, the guests and hosts frequently exchanged toasts. The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. (Attached picture)
