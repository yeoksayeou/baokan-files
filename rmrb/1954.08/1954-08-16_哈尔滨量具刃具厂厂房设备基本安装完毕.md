Installation of equipment in the measuring tool workshop of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory is now basically complete, with the exception of a small number of pieces of equipment that have yet to arrive. Test runs and acceptance procedures are about to begin.

The measuring tool workshop is one of the two main workshops of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory. This workshop, which has both gauge and universal measuring tool workshops, specializes in the manufacture of various precision measuring tools and inspection instruments for the machine manufacturing industry that China was previously unable to produce. One of the most precise instruments, the thousandth-inch feeler gauge, can detect differences as small as one-thousandth the thickness of a human hair. The measuring tool workshop has a high proportion of precision and valuable machine tools, so the transport and installation of the equipment is subject to strict and special requirements. The installation team of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory Construction Project Office began preparing for the special characteristics of the measuring tool workshop's equipment installation as early as the end of last December. During the installation process, crane operators and movers were especially careful when moving machines to avoid damage or vibration. When moving the precision coordinate boring machine, key responsible cadres of the installation team, including the captain and engineer, were on site to provide guidance. Old worker Wu Zhensheng sat in the winch room, skillfully operating the vertical transport device created by section chief Zhao Qiwu, slowly lowering the coordinate boring machine to the installation site and gently placing it down. The workers also tried every means to speed up the installation. The section chiefs and workers of the initial leveling and precision leveling sections came up with a method of first drawing two center lines on the foundation and machine base. This way, during installation, it was easy to determine the position of the machine tool simply by aligning the two lines. When leveling the machine tools, the progress was also faster because the foundation was very flat and the installation workers had accumulated rich experience in the installation project of the cutting tool workshop. Three people using one level could level an average of ten machine tools per day, with a maximum of fifteen. When encountering problems that could not be solved during the installation process, the employees consulted Soviet experts and found solutions. The installation work progressed rapidly, starting on June 21 and basically ending by the end of July. (Xinhua News Agency)

    哈尔滨量具刃具厂厂房设备基本安装完毕
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂量具厂房的设备安装工程，除少数设备还没到达外，到达的设备已经基本上安装完毕。试车、验收的工作就要开始。
    量具厂房是哈尔滨量具刃具厂两大主要厂房之一。这个厂房，设有量规和万能量具两个车间，专门制造我国过去不能制造的供机器制造工业用的各种精密量具和检查仪器。其中一种最精密的千分垫，可以检查出一根头发的千分之一粗细的差异。量具厂房精密贵重机床的比重很大，因此，对设备的搬运、安装，都有严格的特殊的要求。哈尔滨量具刃具厂建厂工程处安装工程队早在去年十二月底就针对量具厂房设备安装的特点，开始做准备工作。在安装过程中，起重搬运工人在搬运机器时，都特别小心，不让机器受到损伤或震动。在搬运精密的坐标镗床时，安装工程队的主要负责干部包括队长和工程师都到现场指导。老工人武振生坐在卷扬机房内，熟练地操纵着工段长赵其武创造的垂直运输装置，将坐标镗床慢慢地送到安装地点又轻轻地放下。工人们并想尽办法来加快安装速度。初平、精平工段段长和工人想出一种方法，先在基础和机床底座上划出两道中心线，这样在安装时只要把两道线对准，便很容易确定机床的位置。在机床找平时，由于基础做得很平，同时，安装工人在刃具厂房的安装工程中又积累了丰富的经验，因而进度也较快。三个人用一部水平仪，平均一天可以找平十台机床，最高达到十五台。职工们在安装过程中碰到不能解决的问题，请教苏联专家后都得到解决。安装工程进展很快，从六月二十一日开始，到七月底就基本结束。　　（新华社）
