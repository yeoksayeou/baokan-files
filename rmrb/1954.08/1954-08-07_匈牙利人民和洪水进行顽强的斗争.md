Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 5th: Due to heavy rain in Central Europe, the Danube River's water level has risen rapidly. The Hungarian people (located in the middle reaches of the Danube), under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the government, have been valiantly fighting the Danube's floods for over three weeks now. As early as mid-July, the water level in Budapest had risen to eight meters, and the water level in the Tiszazug region had exceeded the previous highest level. This is the worst flood in Hungary since 1838. Along the Danube River west of the Hungarian capital Budapest, the floodwaters are level with the riverbanks and are continuing to rise. Workers have been raising the dikes and using waterproof wooden rafts and branches to protect the new dikes. Local residents and farmers are also helping workers by piling earth, cutting branches, and transporting them. After the rescue efforts, Budapest and the villages and towns along the Danube River near it have not suffered from the flood; even in the lowest-lying areas, the river water has not seeped in, and residents have not had to leave their homes. In some areas of the Tiszazug region, the dikes have been submerged due to the rapidly rising water level. However, according to the Hungarian Water Conservancy Bureau, due to the high level of organization among the residents, the affected areas were evacuated in a timely manner, avoiding any deaths. Except for the section west of Tiszazug, the crops flooded elsewhere have been rescued.

According to a report by the Hungarian government's Flood Prevention Committee, the danger of flooding has not yet passed. The people and army in various regions are being mobilized under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the government to actively carry out flood prevention work, consolidating and raising the dikes. The Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic requested the Soviet Army Command to send the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary to help with flood prevention. The Soviet Army Command immediately agreed to the Hungarian government's request, and the Soviet troops equipped with the necessary equipment have been actively assisting in flood prevention work in various sections of the Danube River, demonstrating selfless spirit.

The people affected by the floods have received the deep concern and help of the government and the people of the whole country. The Hungarian Council of Ministers recently passed a resolution to provide relief to flood-affected residents. 10 million forints have been allocated from the relief funds to repair the houses in the Tiszazug region, which was the most severely affected by the floods. Another 10 million forints have been allocated from the state budget as interest-free loans to the flood-affected residents, to be repaid after ten years. In addition, the Hungarian government is also providing assistance to the residents of the affected areas in terms of building materials, seeds, and agricultural tools. At the same time, many food factories across the country are transporting food to the residents who have been evacuated from the flooded areas. This Danube flood has not been able to disrupt the normal life of the People's Hungary.

    匈牙利人民和洪水进行顽强的斗争
    【新华社五日讯】布达佩斯消息：多瑙河的水位由于中欧各地下暴雨而迅速上涨，匈牙利（位于多瑙河中游）人民在劳动人民党和政府领导下跟多瑙河的洪水进行顽强的斗争，到现在已经有三个多星期了。早在七月中旬，布达佩斯的水位就已上涨到八公尺，提厄州的水位已超过过去的最高水位。这是一八三八年以来匈牙利从未有过的洪水。从匈牙利首都布达佩斯往西的多瑙河沿岸，洪水已经与河堤齐平，而且还在继续上涨。工人们进行了加高堤岸的工作，并且用防水木排和树枝来防护新堤。当地居民和农民也帮助工人进行培土，砍伐树枝并把树枝运来。经过抢救之后，布达佩斯及其附近的多瑙河两岸的村镇都没有遭受到洪水的灾害；甚至在地势最低的地区，河水也渗不进来，居民都没有离开自己的家宅。在提厄州的一些地区，由于水位暴涨堤坝已被淹没。但是，据匈牙利水利局的消息，由于居民具有高度的组织性，受灾地区及时进行疏散，避免了死亡事件。除提厄以西的地段外，各处被洪水淹没的庄稼都抢救出来了。
    据匈牙利政府防汛委员会报道，目前水灾的危险还没有过去。各地区的人民和军队正在劳动人民党和政府的领导下动员起来积极进行防汛工作，巩固和加高堤防。匈牙利人民共和国部长会议曾请苏军司令部派遣驻匈牙利的苏联军队来帮助防汛。苏军司令部当即答应匈牙利政府的要求，配备有必要设备的苏联军队就积极帮助多瑙河各段的防汛工作，而且表现了忘我的精神。
    遭受水灾的人都得到了政府和全国人民深切的关怀和帮助。匈牙利部长会议最近已通过了一项救济受灾居民的决议。已从救济金中拨出了一千万福林来修复遭受水灾最严重的提厄州的住宅。又从国家预算中，拨出一千万福林免利贷给遭受水灾的居民，十年以后还本。另外，匈牙利政府还在建筑材料、种子、农具等方面给予受灾地区的居民以帮助。同时，全国各地的许多食品工厂正把食品运给由水淹地区撤退出来的居民。多瑙河这次的洪水，并没有能够破坏人民匈牙利的正常生活。
