Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Under the stern condemnation of world opinion regarding the United States' provocative crimes in the Hainan Island region, the American authorities, who have been desperately trying to deny their guilt and mislead the public, have run out of arguments and justifications. US Secretary of State Dulles avoided discussing the US's provocative incident at a press conference in Washington on August 3.

After the US Air Force's provocative incident, the United States mobilized many official agencies and officials to distort the facts and evade responsibility. However, their excuses were full of loopholes and only served to highlight their guilt. For example, on July 26, the US Department of Defense issued a statement saying that the incident in which the US Air Force shot down Chinese aircraft "occurred twelve miles off Hainan Island." On July 27, the US State Department stated that "the incident occurred in international airspace approximately thirteen miles from Hainan Island." On July 31, US First Fleet Commander Phillips, who directed the provocative crime, said: "The conflict occurred fourteen and a half miles from Hainan Island." On August 1, the Associated Press reported from Tokyo that Phillips said the incident occurred fifteen miles east of Hainan Island. This increasingly distant portrayal of the incident's location from Hainan Island proves that the US government is lying through its teeth, and is desperately trying to cover up the crimes of the US Air Force. But this is futile. The location of the incident was not at some distance from Hainan Island, but directly over Lehui, Hainan Island.

The US authorities have also tried to conceal the premeditated nature of the US's aircraft provocation incident. After the US government directly ordered two aircraft carriers to sail to the waters near Hainan Island to provoke trouble, it was revealed for the first time that the US First Fleet had been transferred to the Far East, bringing the total to two fleets in the Far East, along with the Seventh Fleet already operating there. The US authorities had kept this a secret until now. Later, the US authorities felt that such a large-scale troop deployment would expose the US's conspiracy of planned provocation. Therefore, they again used the Associated Press to cover up the fact, saying: "The navy's use of the word 'fleet' sometimes causes widespread misunderstanding. In fact, the First Fleet now in the South China Sea is composed of the same ships that were stationed in the Western Pacific a few months ago. The only addition is a three-star Navy Lieutenant General and his staff, which makes it a 'fleet.'" This explanation is truly clumsy and laughable. Since the First Fleet had already been transferred to the Far East, and since the First Fleet Commander was recently specially sent over, this further proves that the US's provocative action was deliberately arranged. Even US news agencies admit that putting two fleets in the Far East is "an unusual move," because even during the Korean War, two fleets were not stationed in Asian waters. The US First and Seventh Fleets are still continuing to conduct "exercises" in the Far East, and it is clear that the US is plotting new provocative incidents.

### 在全世界舆论严正谴责下  美国官方无法抵赖在海南岛的挑衅罪责

    在全世界舆论严正谴责下
    美国官方无法抵赖在海南岛的挑衅罪责
    【新华社六日讯】在全世界舆论严正谴责美国在海南岛地区的挑衅罪行下，竭力想抵赖罪行、蒙混视听的美国官方，已词穷理屈。美国国务卿杜勒斯八月三日在华盛顿记者招待会上，已避免再谈论美国的这次挑衅事件。
    在美国空军挑衅事件发生后，美国曾动员许多官方机构及官员出来颠倒黑白，狡赖罪责。但是破绽百出，欲盖弥彰。例如，七月二十六日，美国国防部发表声明说，美国空军击落中国飞机的事件是“发生在海南岛外十二英里的地方”。七月二十七日，美国国务院声明中说，“这次事件是在距海南岛十三英里左右处的公海上空发生的。”七月三十一日，指挥这次挑衅罪行的美国第一舰队司令菲利普斯说：“这次冲突发生在离海南岛十四英里半的地方。”八月一日，美联社从东京发出的电讯又说，菲利普斯说，这个事件发生在海南岛以东的十五英里处。这种把肇事地点和海南岛的距离越说越远的说法证明，美国政府在彻头彻尾地撒谎，美国政府竭力想这样来掩饰美国空军的罪行。但是，这是徒然的。这个事件发生的地点，完全不是在离海南岛多少英里的地方，而正是在海南岛乐会的上空。
    美国当局还力图掩饰美国预谋制造这次飞机挑衅事件。在这次美国政府直接命令两艘航空母舰驶到海南岛附近海面寻衅以后，第一次公开透露出美国第一舰队已调到远东地区，连同原来在远东活动的第七舰队，共有两个舰队在远东海面上。这是在此以前美国当局一直秘不宣布的。美国当局后来感到这样大规模地调兵遣将无异暴露了美国有计划挑衅的阴谋，因此又通过美联社来掩饰说：“海军用‘舰队’这个字眼有时候引起了普遍的误解。实际上，现在南中国海的第一舰队是由几个月以前驻在西太平洋的同一些舰只组成的。所增加的不过是一位三星海军中将和他的幕僚，使它成为一个‘舰队’。”这种辩解实在是拙劣可笑。既然第一舰队早已调到远东海面，既然最近又特别把第一舰队司令派来，这就更加证明美国的挑衅行动是蓄意布置的。连美国通讯社也承认：把两个舰队放在远东海面上是“不寻常的行动”，因为甚至在朝鲜战争期间也没有把两个舰队摆在亚洲海面上。美国现在第一和第七两个舰队还继续留在远东海面上进行“演习”，显然，美国在阴谋制造新的挑衅事件。
