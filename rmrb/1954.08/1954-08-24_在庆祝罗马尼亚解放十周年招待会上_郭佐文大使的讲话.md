Comrade Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, Distinguished Heads of the Diplomatic Corps, Comrades and Friends:

    Please allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for attending this reception celebrating the tenth anniversary of Romania's liberation.

    Ten years ago, the glorious Soviet army liberated the Romanian people from the tyranny of Hitler. This enabled the patriotic forces, organized and led by the Romanian Communist Party, to overthrow the fascist dictatorship in their own country.

    August 23, 1944, was a decisive turning point in the lives of the Romanian people. For the first time in their history, the Romanian people gained freedom, the right to be masters of their own destiny, and the right to embark on the bright path of true democracy and socialist construction.

    For ten years, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, with the generous and multifaceted assistance of the Soviet Union, the Romanian people have achieved significant successes in all sectors of work. Currently, industrial output is approaching three times that of 1938. New industrial sectors such as machine manufacturing, electrical engineering, oil and mining equipment, trucks, tractors, and agricultural machinery manufacturing have been established.

    The state provides substantial assistance to the working peasants to increase production. Strong socialist components have been established in agriculture. Currently, the broad masses of people are enthusiastically completing the tasks assigned to them by the Party and the government to continuously develop agriculture and the consumer goods manufacturing industry; in this way, the living standards of the masses are steadily improving.

    The Romanian People's Republic, within the peace and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, together with all peace-loving peoples of all countries, is fighting to realize the principles of the great international policy initiated by the Soviet Union, which are: to resolve disputes between countries through negotiation in order to ease international tensions; to strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems; to strive for close economic and cultural relations between countries; and to strive for collective security in Europe and peace throughout the world.

    Our government and people congratulate with excitement the achievements of the Geneva Conference and the great victory of the Indochinese people in their struggle for peace, freedom, and national independence. Thanks to the efforts of the Soviet and Chinese delegations, the Geneva Conference made extremely important resolutions; this is a great victory for the forces of peace and a serious defeat for the forces of war. The Geneva Conference clearly demonstrated the increasing international isolation of the U.S. aggressive bloc, which did not contribute to the success of the common cause of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the French Republic, the United Kingdom, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam aimed at restoring peace in Indochina; instead, they conspired to undermine the restoration of peace.

    The Geneva Conference fully demonstrated the importance and role of the great Chinese people as a positive factor in solving international problems and consolidating world peace; it showed how necessary and meaningful it is to recognize the true representatives of the Chinese people to participate in the United Nations.

    The Romanian people are pleased with the successes achieved by the People's Republic of China in international politics and with the achievements made by the People's Republic of China in developing the national economy in order to transform itself into a powerful socialist country.

    The relations between the Romanian people and the great Chinese people are developing and consolidating daily, which is one of the foundations of the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples.

    Today, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Romania's liberation, the Romanian people express their gratitude and love to the Soviet Union. They also sincerely pay tribute to the great Chinese people, the people of the People's Democratic countries, and all the people of all countries who are fighting for peace, freedom, and progress.

    Long live the Romanian People's Republic!

    Long live the fraternal friendship and cooperation between Romania and the great Chinese people!

    Long live the great peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    Long live world peace!

    在庆祝罗马尼亚解放十周年招待会上
    郭佐文大使的讲话尊敬的中央人民政府副主席同志，高贵的外交使团首长们，同志们和朋友们：
    请允许我对你们参加这次罗马尼亚解放十周年庆祝会，表示衷心的感谢。
    十年以前，光荣的苏联军队把罗马尼亚人民从希特勒暴政之下解放出来。这样，就使在罗马尼亚共产党的组织和领导下的爱国力量得以推翻本国的法西斯专政。
      一九四四年八月二十三日是罗马尼亚人民生活中的一个决定性的转折点。罗马尼亚人民在他们的历史上第一次获得了自由，获得了成为他们自己命运的主人的权利，以及走向真正民主和建设社会主义的光明大道的权利。
    十年来，罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，在苏联的多方面的慷慨的援助下，已经在所有工作部门中获得了重大的成就。目前，工业产量已接近一九三八年的三倍。新的工业部门如机器制造、电工、石油和采矿装备、卡车、拖拉机、农业机器制造等工业已经建立起来。
    国家给予劳动农民大量的帮助以增加生产。强大的社会主义的成份已经在农业中建立起来。目前，广大人民正在热情地完成党和政府为不断发展农业和消费品制造工业而给予他们的任务；这样，群众的生活水平正在稳步地提高。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国在以苏联为首的和平、民主阵营内，与所有爱好和平的各国人民一起，正在为实现苏联所创议的伟大的国际政策的原则而斗争，这些原则是：通过协商方式，解决各国间的争端，以缓和国际紧张局势；争取不同社会制度的各国之间的和平共处；争取各国间经济上和文化上的密切关系；争取欧洲的集体安全和全世界的和平。
    我国政府和人民以兴奋的心情，祝贺日内瓦会议的成就，祝贺印度支那人民在他们争取和平、自由和民族独立的斗争中所获得的伟大胜利。由于苏联和中华人民共和国代表团的努力，日内瓦会议作出了极其重要的决议；这是和平力量的伟大胜利，也是战争力量的严重失败。日内瓦会议清楚地说明了美国侵略集团在国际上更加陷于孤立，它们并没有为苏联、中华人民共和国、法兰西共和国、联合王国和越南民主共和国的旨在恢复印度支那和平的共同事业的成功出过力量；反而阴谋破坏和平的恢复。
    日内瓦会议充分表明了作为解决国际问题和巩固世界和平的积极因素的伟大的中国人民的重要性及其作用；它表明了承认中国人民的真正的代表参加联合国多么必要，多么有意义。
    罗马尼亚人民为中华人民共和国在国际政治方面所获得的成功，为中华人民共和国在发展国民经济，以便转变成为一个强大的社会主义国家方面所获得的成就，而感到高兴。
    罗马尼亚人民与伟大的中国人民之间的关系，正在日益发展和巩固，这是我们两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊的基础之一。
    今天，值此罗马尼亚解放十周年之际，罗马尼亚人民向苏联表达感激和热爱的心情。他们也衷心地向伟大的中国人民、人民民主国家的人民，和所有为争取和平、自由与进步的各国人民致以敬意。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国万岁！
    罗马尼亚和伟大的中国人民之间的兄弟般的友好与合作万岁！
    以苏联为首的伟大的和平、民主阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
