    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 27th (via Polish Press Agency): On August 25th, Stanisław Gajewski, Ambassador of the Polish People's Republic to France, delivered a note to French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Gilbert de Bourbon Busset. The full text of the note is as follows:

    The Government of the Polish People's Republic has repeatedly notified the relevant countries and countries bordering Germany, particularly France, of the immense danger to peace that would arise from the revival of German militarism. Today, attempts to revive German militarism appear under the guise of the so-called "European Defense Community." The "European Defense Community" will inevitably lead to the revival of the German Wehrmacht under the command of Nazi generals. This group is conducive to strengthening the most aggressive imperialist elements in West Germany, whose aim is to turn the country into the dominant military power in Western Europe. It is well known that the ruling clique in Bonn and the forces supporting them are striving to implement the "European Defense Community" treaty, not for defensive purposes, but solely to begin the conquest of Europe as quickly as possible. These plans are the subject of public statements by West German political and military leaders, openly speaking of the deprivation of Poland's western territories; the aggressive nature of these plans, goals, and schemes for Germany's neighbors—especially Poland and France—cannot give rise to the slightest illusion. The so-called defensive nature of the European Defense Community cannot withstand scrutiny under a strict analysis of the facts, because the countries drawn into this agreement are not threatened by any danger from anywhere. The only real danger that threatens them is the release of German revanchists, militarists, and Nazis.

    In this situation, the Polish and French governments should take steps to reverse this dangerous course of events and work together to strengthen the security of both countries.

    Therefore, in order to strengthen the security of Poland and France and to strengthen the general security of Europe, the Government of the Polish People's Republic proposes to the French Government to conclude a treaty of alliance and mutual assistance and to begin detailed talks on this issue as soon as possible.

    The conclusion of a treaty of alliance and mutual assistance between Poland and France will contribute to a pan-European collective security system, the principles of which have already been put forward in the Soviet Government's proposal of February 10, 1954, and the note of July 24, 1954. By strengthening collective security in Europe, the Franco-Polish treaty of alliance and mutual assistance is in line with both the principles of the general universal security system and the basic intentions of the United Nations Charter.

    In making this proposal, the Government of the Polish People's Republic deems it necessary to emphasize that any form of the "European Defense Community" will inevitably lead to the establishment of a new German Wehrmacht, to the complete domination of the West German state by the most aggressive revanchist Nazis, to complete domination of its economic and political life, its military, and the entire public life. The "European Defense Community" also means the hegemony of these Nazis in Western Europe, meaning the loss of decision-making power of the countries that make up this "group," which will ultimately lead to a new world war. With this danger, the situation will arise in which France will be dragged by the organizers of the so-called "European Defense Community" onto the road leading to a war against Eastern European countries, which is contrary to the national interests of France.

    The security, peace, and independence of every European country, regardless of its political system, can be guaranteed by the pan-European treaty on European collective security proposed by the Soviet government. A collective security treaty would facilitate the solution of the German problem, facilitating the restoration of the unity and sovereignty of the German people based on the principles of peace and democracy. At the same time, this treaty will give all countries a sense of stability and security, enabling them to concentrate on peaceful construction without fear of aggression or interference in the affairs of any sovereign state.

    In Geneva, the possibility was reaffirmed that important international issues could be resolved by gradually eliminating the difficulties that currently exist between countries. In Geneva, while blood was flowing on the battlefield, a painful political and military conflict that had lasted for many years was resolved. The representatives of France and the Soviet Union played a leading role in resolving these issues.

    A peaceful solution to the German problem is a matter of paramount importance to the national survival of both Poland and France. It is well known that the choice of the correct path to ensure European security now depends to a considerable extent on the decision of France. The attitude taken by France can prevent the revanchist Wehrmacht from being restored and gaining power within the framework of the "European Defense Community" or in any other form.

    Poland raises this issue out of friendship for France, out of concern for the security of our two countries; Poland remembers the long and glorious tradition of cultural relations between our two countries, remembers the combat friendship of Polish and French soldiers, remembers the blood shed by Polish soldiers alongside French soldiers in the fight against German aggressors in France during the years of the First World War, the blood shed by Polish combatants in 1939-40, and the blood shed by tens of thousands of Poles in the French Resistance during the Second World War. Poland, at this important historical moment, expresses its attitude, reminding the fraternal French people that the same forces that brought tragic fate to the people of our two countries in the last war are now being allowed to revive and gain power under the "European Defense Community."

    History shows that the security and independence of France, as well as its position as a great power, are of the most immediate interest to Poland, and similarly, the independence of Poland and the development of its strength are also beneficial to France.

    This is why a treaty of alliance and mutual assistance that will link the Polish and French people together with new ties can play a special role.

    The Government of the Polish People's Republic proposes that the contracting parties undertake the following obligations in this treaty:

    1.  Not to participate in any alliance or agreement directed against either contracting party;

    2.  To consult with each other if either contracting party is threatened by an attack by German militarist revanchist forces;

    3.  To support each other's efforts aimed at consolidating European collective security and peacefully resolving the German problem;

    4.  To immediately provide all assistance and support to the party that is attacked by German forces;

    5.  To promote economic and cultural cooperation in order to strengthen friendly relations between the two countries;

    6.  To fulfill the obligations arising from the treaty in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.

    The conclusion of the treaty proposed by the Government of the Polish People's Republic will strengthen the ties between France and Poland, it will strengthen the security of the French Republic and Poland, thereby contributing to strengthening the security of all of Europe.

    波兰人民共和国政府照会法国政府
    建议缔结波法同盟互助条约
    防止德国军国主义的威胁保障两国安全
    【新华社二十八日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙二十七日电：八月二十五日，波兰人民共和国驻法大使斯坦尼斯瓦夫·加耶夫斯基将照会一件递交给法国外交部国务秘书吉兰·德波蒙。照会全文如下：
    波兰人民共和国政府曾不止一次地知照有关国家和同德国相邻的国家，特别是法国，指出一旦德国军国主义复活，将会有多么巨大的危险威胁和平。今天，复活德国军国主义的尝试以所谓“欧洲防务集团”为面具而出现。“欧洲防务集团”必不可免地会导致德国国防军在纳粹将领指挥下复活，这个集团有利于加强西德最具有侵略性的帝国主义分子，其目的是要把这个国家变为西欧支配性的军事力量。大家知道，波恩的统治集团和支持他们的势力在竭力要求履行“欧洲防务集团”条约，决不是为了防御目的，而只是为了尽速着手完成征服欧洲的计划。这些计划是西德政治和军事首脑发表公开谈话的主题，这些计划公开讲到要剥夺波兰西部的领土；这些计划讲到的目标与图谋对于德国的邻国——特别是波兰和法国——所具有的侵略性质是不能引起丝毫错觉的。所谓欧洲防务集团的所谓防御性质是经不起在严格分析事实的情况下所作的考察的，因为被拉进这个协定的国家并没有受到来自任何地方的任何危险的威胁。而唯一真正使他们受到威胁的危险是在于释放德国的复仇主义分子、军国主义分子和纳粹分子。
    在这种情况下，波兰政府和法国政府应采取步骤扭转这种危险的事态发展趋势，并同心协力加强两国的安全。
    因此，波兰人民共和国政府，为了加强波兰和法国的安全以及为了加强欧洲的普遍安全，向法国政府建议缔结一个同盟互助条约。并尽早就这个问题开始进行详细的会谈。
    波兰和法国缔结同盟互助条约将有助于全欧集体安全体系，关于这个体系的原则，苏联政府一九五四年二月十日的建议和一九五四年七月二十四日的照会中已经提出。由于加强欧洲的集体安全，波—法同盟互助条约既符合总的普遍安全体系的原则，也符合联合国宪章的基本意旨。
    波兰人民共和国政府在提出这个建议的同时，认为有必要着重指出，任何形式的“欧洲防务集团”必定导致一支新的德国国防军的建立，导致最侵略成性的复仇主义的纳粹分子完全支配西德国家，完全支配它的经济和政治生活，完全支配它的军队和整个公众生活。“欧洲防务集团”还意味着这些纳粹分子在西欧的霸权，意味着组成这个“集团”的国家丧失决定权，而这最终将导致新的世界大战。随着这种危险，将发生这样的情况：法国将被所谓
  “欧洲防务集团”的组织者拖上引向对东欧国家发动战争的道路，而这是违反法国的民族利益的。
    每一个欧洲国家，不论其政治制度如何，它的安全、和平和独立都能由于苏联政府建议的关于欧洲集体安全的全欧条约而得到保障。集体安全条约将有利于德国问题的解决，有利于根据和平和民主的原则恢复德国人民的统一和主权。这个条约同时将给予一切国家稳定和安全的感觉，使得它们能集中精力于和平建设，而不必担心侵略，或是担心对于任何主权国家事务的干涉。
    在日内瓦，重新肯定了这样一个可能性：可以用逐渐消除目前各国之间存在的困难的办法来解决重要的国际问题，在战场上正在流血的时候，在日内瓦解决了进行了许多年的一场痛苦的政治和军事的冲突。法国和苏联的代表在解决这些问题方面起了主导作用。
    和平解决德国问题是一件对波兰和法国的民族生存都至为重要的事情。大家都知道，选择正确的道路来保障欧洲的安全，现在在相当大的程度上要取决于法国的决定。法国所采取的态度能够防止复仇主义的国防军在“欧洲防务集团”范围内，或是在任何其他形式下恢复。
    波兰提出这个问题，是出于对法国的友谊，出于对我们两国安全的关怀；波兰记得我们两国之间的文化关系的悠久的、光荣的传统，记得波兰和法国军人的战斗友谊，记得波兰兵士在第一次世界大战的年代里，在法国和法国兵士并肩抵抗德国侵略者的战斗中流的鲜血，波兰战斗员在一九三九—四○年流的鲜血，以及第二次世界大战期间成千成万波兰人在法国的抵抗运动中流的鲜血。波兰在这个重要的历史时刻表明自己的态度，提醒兄弟般的法国人民：在上次战争中使我们两国人民遭到悲惨命运的同一力量，现在将被容许在“欧洲防务集团”之下复活并得势。
    历史显示，法国的安全和独立以及它作为大国的地位，对于波兰有最切身的利害关系，同样的，波兰的独立和它的力量的发展对于法国也是有利的。
    这就是为什么将以新的联系把波兰和法国人民连结在一起的同盟互助条约能够发挥特殊作用的原因。
    波兰人民共和国政府建议，在这个条约中缔约双方承担如下义务：
    一、不参与针对缔约一方的任何同盟或任何协定；
    二、缔约一方有受到德国军国主义复仇势力进攻的威胁时，彼此即进行磋商；
    三、互相支持旨在巩固欧洲集体安全和和平解决德国问题的努力；
    四、对受到德国军队进攻的一方立即给予一切援助和支持；
    五、促进经济和文化合作，以加强两国之间的友好关系；
    六、本联合国宪章的精神履行条约所产生的义务。
    缔结波兰人民共和国政府建议的条约将加强法国和波兰之间的联系，它将加强法兰西共和国和波兰的安全，从而有助于加强全欧洲的安全。
