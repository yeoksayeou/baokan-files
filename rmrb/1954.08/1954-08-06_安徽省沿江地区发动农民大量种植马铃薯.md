Anhui Province's Wuhu and Anqing Special Districts have mobilized farmers to open up wasteland in mountainous and hilly areas to plant potatoes. Wuhu Special District plans to plant one million mu, and Anqing Special District plans to plant 500,000 to 600,000 mu, requiring all planting to be completed by mid-August.

Both special districts convened meetings of responsible cadres and technicians from various counties around July 20th to study cultivation, management techniques, and issues to be aware of during planting. They were required to pay attention to soil and water conservation when opening up wasteland, ensuring that they could increase income without causing soil erosion.

Various localities also made early preparations for potato seeds and tools needed for land reclamation. In addition to purchasing a batch of potato seeds in Nanling, Guangde, and other areas of Wuhu Special District, the province also purchased more than 50 million jin from Henan, Shanxi, and other places to supply their needs. About 70,000 pieces of tools such as furrowing hoes, rakes, sickles, and machetes needed by Anqing Special District were contracted and supplied by local supply and marketing cooperatives. The county cooperative headquarters have made more than 26,000 pieces of large and small tools, and the rest can be completed soon. (Mo Rutang, Zhang Xuewen)

    安徽省沿江地区发动农民大量种植马铃薯
    安徽省芜湖、安庆两专区发动农民在山区和丘陵地带开荒种植马铃薯。芜湖专区计划种植一百万亩，安庆专区计划种植五、六十万亩，要求在八月中旬全部种植完毕。
    两专区都在七月二十日前后，分别召开了各县负责干部和技术人员会议，研究了栽培、管理技术和种植中所应注意的问题。要求在开荒时要注意水土保持，做到既能增加收入，又不使水土流失。
    在马铃薯种子和开荒时所需工具的准备方面，各地也及早进行。芜湖专区除在南陵、广德一带购买一批马铃薯种外，省里还从河南、山西等地购买了五千多万斤，供应他们需要。安庆专区所需的条锄、钉耙、镰刀、砍刀等共约七万件，统由各地供销合作社包制包供，各县合作总社已制成大小工具二万六千余件，其余在最近亦可全部完成。（莫儒棠、张学文）
