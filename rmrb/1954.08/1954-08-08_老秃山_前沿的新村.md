    New Village on the Front Lines of "Old Baldy Mountain"
    Zhou Chengxin
    It has been a year since the Korean armistice. Today, one year after the ceasefire, when people step back onto Korean soil, they can see the cities and villages destroyed by the American bandits being rapidly and intensely rebuilt everywhere. The heroic Korean people are creating a new life with their hard work. Not long ago, I visited a new village rebuilt from the ruins by the joint efforts of volunteer soldiers and the Korean people near the front line of "Old Baldy Mountain" – Saengnyeong-ri. Saengnyeong-ri is located on the largest plain in western Cheorwon County, a scenic area in Cheorwon County. Not far south of the village stands the beautiful Geum Mountain, and the Imjin River flows beneath it, forming a wide plain from east to west. Before the war, more than 400 households, totaling over 2,000 people, lived here, cultivating more than 900,000 pyeong of land. The village also had a middle school and two elementary schools.
    During the war, more than 700 houses here were bombed by the American invaders, and more than 900,000 pyeong of land became barren. On one occasion, the enemy massacred more than 30 civilians here. However, the enemy's shells could not destroy the strong will of the Korean people. In 1951, the people of Saengnyeong-ri and the people of nearby villages organized a guerrilla force of more than 600 people, and under the leadership of Nam Gung-jang, the local Workers' Party chairman, launched a struggle against the enemy. In the four months of the second half of 1951 alone, they engaged the enemy in more than 23 large-scale battles, annihilating more than 800 enemy soldiers, destroying 23 enemy tanks, and shooting down 9 enemy planes. Among them, four people were awarded the title of Hero of the Republic, and more than 20 people were awarded various medals and awards. In 1952, under the enemy's artillery blockade, they rushed to plant more than 600,000 pyeong of land, and in production, six people were awarded the Order of Labor of the Republic. During the fierce battle of "Old Baldy Mountain," they organized a support team of more than 120 people, who were responsible for transportation, stretcher-bearing, and rescue work during the battle.
    When we arrived here, more than 100 neat houses had been built in the village, and 123 households had moved into new homes. They also formed the "Baeknosan Agricultural Production Cooperative" with the original guerrilla force as its core.
    We walked into the office of the cooperative, where Nam Gung-jang, who led them during the war and is now the labor party chairman of this new village, greeted us and excitedly told us about the changes and growth of this new village. He said:
    "How painful it was for us to return to our shattered hometown destroyed by the enemy. However, no one said anything. We held a meeting together, made a plan, and immediately started working.
    "The more severely the enemy destroyed, the deeper our hatred became. Hatred made everyone forget all difficulties. In a very short period, we cleared the rubble from the village ruins, filled in more than 400 large bomb craters around the village, and with the help of the state's tractors, we reclaimed nearly 400,000 pyeong of wasteland and quickly planted seeds."
    People who have been tempered by war understand the power of the collective and the benefits of mutual assistance and cooperation. Now, all the families in the village have joined the agricultural production cooperative. Chairman Nam Gung-jang said with a smile: "The three years of war have made all the people in our village of one mind, and the whole village has become one family."
    He added: "Now, everyone's work is almost always completed with a spirit of blitzkrieg every day, and labor efficiency often exceeds the original plan by two or three times. At present, we have completed more than 200 tons of fertilizer application, and all wheat, millet, and potatoes have been hoeed two or three times. Everyone unanimously proposed to over fulfill this year's production plan of 128 tons."
    When Chairman Nam Gung-jang talked about the restoration of this village, he especially mentioned the help of the volunteer soldiers. He said that the volunteer soldiers had given them great help and care in terms of food, clothing, and labor. At the most difficult time of construction, the volunteer soldiers provided them with more than 6,000 kilograms of grain. Starting in March of this year, the volunteer soldiers personally participated in the construction of houses in their village. In the thawing month of March, the soldiers braved heavy rain to cross the Imjin River to bring back building materials, and in more than a week, they built 106 houses, followed by a 24-room democratic propaganda room and a school classroom. In addition, the soldiers also helped them build five dams and two canals, and helped them transport manure with carts.
    Chairman Nam Gung-jang led us to visit their new village. Every house in the village was inhabited, and although the furniture in the houses was still very simple, it was all clean and tidy. Many families had woven sorghum stalk fences in front of their doors, and pumpkin vines were climbing up the roofs along the fences. There was an old lady named Kim whose son had sacrificed in the guerrilla team, and only her daughter-in-law and two grandsons were left in the family. The eldest grandson was just sixteen years old and was a production team member of the agricultural production cooperative. The disaster of the war did not destroy the old lady's will to live at all. When we walked to her door, the old lady was sitting under a small tree twisting straw ropes. She pointed to the new house and said to us: "This was done by the volunteer comrades!" Then she pointed to a pile of broken rubble next to the house and said: "This was done by the American devils!" The old lady said many more words, and although I didn't understand them, I knew that the war experience had made this old lady understand what truth really is.
    In the new village, we also visited the cooperative's clinic, barber shop, blacksmith group, and tailor group. The clinic and barber shop provide free services to the members, and the blacksmith group and tailor group are the sideline production of the cooperative. Chairman Nam Gung-jang said that in addition to these, the whole cooperative also raises more than 200 chickens, more than 100 ducks, and more than a dozen pigs. It is estimated that the sideline production will generate more than 3 million won this year.
    In the democratic propaganda room built by the volunteer soldiers, the four walls are decorated very beautifully. The members spend some time here every night to study culture and current affairs policies. We saw a series of cartoons titled "Remember the Blood Debt" posted on the wall along with many propaganda posters, which collected the atrocities committed by the American robbers in their village and nearby. Chairman Nam Gung-jang said: "We will never forget the deep blood feud. In order to avenge it, we must quickly restore peaceful life!"
    In the evening, when we walked out of the village, the setting sun had already reddened the beautiful Geum Mountain. Several wisps of smoke were rising from the village, and the elementary school students had just walked out of the school singing songs. On the roads near and far, there were songs and laughter of male and female production team members returning home from the fields. We stood on the hillside behind the village and looked back at this thriving village. Who could tell that a year ago this was still the front line of Old Baldy Mountain where fierce battles were taking place! Who could not be deeply moved by the infinite creative power of the heroic Korean people! (Attached picture)

    “老秃山”前沿的新村
    周诚信
    朝鲜停战已经一年了。在这停战一年后的今天，当人们重新踏上朝鲜土地的时候，可以到处看见那些被美国强盗破坏的城市、村庄都在迅速地、紧张地恢复着。英雄的朝鲜人民正用自己辛勤的劳动创造着新的生活。不久以前，我在靠近“老秃山”前沿访问了志愿军战士和朝鲜人民共同从废墟上重建起来的一个新村——朔宁里。朔宁里位于铁原郡西部一个最大的平川上，这个平川一向是铁原郡的风景区。村南不远耸立着美丽的金山，山下奔流着临津江，东西形成一道宽阔的平川。战争以前，这里曾住着四百多户人家，共两千多人口，种着九十多万坪田地。村庄上还有一个中学和两个小学。
    战争中，这里的七百多间房子被美国侵略者炸平了，九十多万坪土地也荒芜起来。一次，敌人就在这里枪杀了三十多个老百姓。但是，敌人的炮弹并不能摧毁朝鲜人民的坚强意志。一九五一年，朔宁里的人民就和附近村庄的人民组织了一支六百多人的游击队，在当地劳动党委员长南宫场的领导下，和敌人展开了斗争。仅在一九五一年下半年的四个月中，他们就和敌人进行了二十三次规模较大的战斗，歼敌八百多名，击毁了敌人坦克二十三辆、击落敌机九架。他们当中四人获得了共和国英雄的称号，二十多人获得了各种勋章和奖章。一九五二年，他们在敌人炮火封锁下，又抢种了六十多万坪土地，在生产中，又有六人获得了共和国劳动勋章。在激烈的“老秃山”战斗中，他们曾组织了一百二十多人的支前队，担任了战斗中的运输、担架、救护等工作。
    当我们来到这里的时候，村庄上已经修起了一百多座整齐的房舍，一百二十三户人家已经搬进了新的住宅。他们还以原先的游击队为核心组成了“白露山农业生产合作社”。
    我们走进了合作社的办公室，在战争中领导他们，现在又成了这个新村的劳动党委员长南宫场来迎接我们，并兴奋地给我们讲述了这个新村的变化和成长。他说：
    “回到被敌人毁坏得破碎的家乡，我们的心是多么难受呀。可是，大家谁也没有说什么，我们在一起开了会，作了计划，就马上动手干起来了。
    “敌人破坏得越惨重，我们的仇恨也越深刻。仇恨使大家忘记了一切困难。在很短期间内，我们便清除了村庄废墟上的残砖碎瓦，填平了周围四百多个大炸弹坑，在国家的拖拉机帮助下，开垦了近四十万坪荒地，并且很快下了种。”
    经过战争锻炼的人们，是懂得集体的力量、互助合作的好处的。现在，村里的人家已全部参加了农业生产合作社。南宫场委员长笑着说：“三年的战争使我们全村人成了一条心，全村成了一家人。”
    他又说：“现在大家的工作，几乎每天都用突击精神来完成，劳动效率经常要超出原计划的两、三倍。目前，我们已经完成了二百多吨的施肥工作，所有麦子、谷子和马铃薯都锄过了两、三遍，大家一致提出要超额完成今年一百二十八吨产量的生产计划。”
    南宫场委员长讲起这个村子的恢复时，特别提到了志愿军战士对他们的帮助。他说，志愿军从吃的粮食、穿的衣服和劳动力各方面，都给了他们极大的帮助和照顾。在开始建设最困难的时候，志愿军救济了他们六千多斤粮食。从今年三月开始恢复起，志愿军就亲自参加了他们村庄房舍的修建工程。战士们在那刚解冻的三月天里，冒着大雨淌过临津江去搬回修建的木料，在一个多星期中，盖起了一百零六间住宅，接着又修起了一座二十四间房子大的民主宣传室和一座小学校的教室。另外，战士们还帮助他们修起了五个水坝和两条水渠，用大车帮助他们送粪。
    南宫场委员长领我们参观了他们的新村。村里的每一座房舍都住上了人家，屋子里的家具虽然还很简单，但是都收拾得干净整齐。许多人家门口都编起了秫秸篱笆，南瓜蔓正顺着篱笆爬上屋顶。有一位姓金的老大娘，她的儿子在游击队中牺牲了，家里只剩下儿媳妇和两个孙子。大孙子刚十六岁，是农业生产合作社的生产队员。战争的灾难并没有丝毫摧毁这位老人家的生活意志，当我们走到她的门前，老人家正坐在小树下拧草绳，她指着新房子对我们说：“这是志愿军同志干的！”又指着屋旁一堆破碎的瓦砾说：“这是美国鬼子干的！”老人家还说了许多话，我虽然没有听懂，但是，我知道战争经历使这位老人懂得了真理究竟是什么。
    在新村里，我们还参观了合作社里的诊疗所、理发室、铁匠组和裁缝组。诊疗所和理发室都是免费为社员服务的，铁匠组和裁缝组都是社里的副业生产。南宫场委员长说，他们的副业生产除了这些以外，全社还分别养了二百多只鸡、一百多只鸭子和十多口猪。预计今年副业生产还要收入三百多万元。
    在志愿军修起的民主宣传室里，四壁都布置得十分美观，社员们晚上都要抽出一定时间在这里学习文化和时事政策。我们看见墙壁上和许多宣传画贴在一起的有一副标题为“记住血债”的连环画，画里收集了美国强盗在他们这里和附近的暴行。南宫场委员长说：“血海深仇我们永不会忘记，为了报仇，就要迅速恢复起和平生活！”
    傍晚，当我们走出村庄，夕阳已经照红了美丽的金山。村庄上空几道炊烟缕缕升起，小学生们刚从学校里唱着歌走出来，远近的路上，都有从田间回家的男女生产队员的歌声和笑声。我们站在村后的山坡上，回头看着这个欣欣向荣的村庄。谁能看出一年以前这里还是进行着激烈战斗的老秃山前沿呢！谁能不为英雄的朝鲜人民这种无穷的创造力量深深感动呢！（附图片）
