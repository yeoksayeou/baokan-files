    Returning from Geneva
　  By Our Correspondent　Wu Wentao
    8. Two Days of Flight
    After the heavy rain of the afternoon and night, when we left Moscow on the morning of July 30th, the clouds were light and the wind was gentle, a relatively rare good weather during the past week's visit. Due to the special weather conditions, Europe has had an unusually large amount of rain this year. In Geneva, we heard about the flood warning for the Danube River basin, the largest river in Europe; it is said that the water level in the riverside cities is the highest in over a century. When we arrived in Berlin, we heard news of floods in the Elbe River and other rivers. Even when we flew to Ulaanbaatar in Asia on July 31st, the comrades there said that it had been raining heavily on the grasslands every day, and the rainfall this year was greater than in previous years!
    During the two-day journey from Moscow to Ulaanbaatar, the Soviet comrades made careful and thoughtful arrangements for the delegation in advance, including where to have breakfast, where to have lunch and rest, so there was no feeling of fatigue like that of continuous flights.
    Kazan was the first stop we landed on the way. As soon as the plane landed, the comrade in charge of the station brought a female doctor in her forties to the plane, repeatedly asking who was feeling unwell, who was airsick..., and only stopped when she understood that everyone was fine. His kind and amiable attitude reminded me of an incident on a Siberian train in the winter of 1952 when I was an ordinary passenger.
    At night, our child developed a high fever. After the doctor on the train checked him, he thought it was necessary to have a pediatrician re-diagnose him. He looked at his watch, it was already one o'clock in the night. He told me: in two hours, there will be a station where the train will stop for more than ten minutes, and a telegram can be sent to notify the experts in the nearby towns; as he spoke, he left a few pills and left. Two hours later, as soon as the train stopped, a female comrade, who was not yet thirty years old, took off her snow-covered headscarf and coat, walked into our small compartment, and immediately conducted an examination, gave an injection, and instructed us on how to take care of him. She patted the child's flushed face with a smile and said, "Baby, you will get well soon!" She also wished us a safe journey. Before we could express our heartfelt thanks to her, she hurried off the train, and the train slowly started again. By the light of the station, I saw that in the snowy night, the respectable and lovely female comrade left the station alone carrying her handbag.
    This is just an isolated example, but it shows the noble qualities of Soviet citizens who are loyal to their duties. This quality is common to all the Soviets I have come into contact with, although most of them are just passing acquaintances.
    On the section from Irkutsk to Ulaanbaatar, the weather suddenly became overcast and the plane was sometimes bumpy. Comrade Yeltsin, the attendant, explained to us why the plane sometimes felt like it was falling into an abyss, and said that this was a normal phenomenon, so as to avoid anxiety for comrades with little flying experience.
    At six o'clock in the afternoon, we landed in Ulaanbaatar. The leaders of the Mongolian People's Republic government, led by Prime Minister Tsedenbal, and representatives of mass organizations had been waiting in the rain to welcome Premier Zhou, but Premier Zhou's plane did not appear from the clouds until more than an hour later.
    9. In the City of "Red Hero"
    After getting off the plane, Premier Zhou and several comrades of the delegation went to Marshal Choibalsan's former summer villa, which was backed by mountains and full of trees, for a short rest. We stayed in a new-style "country house" far from the city. In this two-story guest house, the comrades of the Mongolian People's Republic had prepared for us with unimaginable thoughtfulness: from chocolates to mineral water and wine, from face towels to toothbrushes and perfume, from radios to stationery and telegraph paper.... A dedicated hairdresser comrade seemed a little disappointed in us, because no one had taken the time to get a haircut even after she had repeatedly urged us; the comrade in charge of receiving us, fearing that we would not eat well due to the tight schedule, looked at his watch and said, "It doesn't matter, there are still five minutes, eat more, drink more!"
    That evening, Premier Zhou first called on Prime Minister Tsedenbal and Comrade Sambuu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Khural. Everyone then followed Premier Zhou to visit the tomb of Sukhe-Bator, the revolutionary teacher of the Mongolian people, and Marshal Choibalsan, and laid wreaths to pay their respects. The mausoleum is in front of the Council of Ministers Building, flanked by the magnificently built People's Opera House and Cinema.... Looking out over the Tuul River valley, the lights twinkled, which was quite spectacular. The people of the Mongolian People's Republic named their capital Ulaanbaatar (meaning "Red Hero"), which has a profound meaning of commemorating revolutionary martyrs.
    After that, there was a grand banquet and song and dance evening held by Prime Minister Tsedenbal for Premier Zhou and the Chinese delegation. In all these activities, as well as in the visit on the morning of the next day (August 1), Prime Minister Tsedenbal was inseparable from Premier Zhou, and they were exceptionally close. At the banquet, everyone repeatedly toasted the health of Chairman Malenkov, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Prime Minister Tsedenbal, and wished that our compatriots in Taiwan would be liberated soon.
    Before the delegation set off for a visit on the morning of August 1, Chairman Sambuu, accompanied by Prime Minister Tsedenbal, came to Premier Zhou's residence to present "Hada" and used a golden bowl to hold mare's milk (it is said that this is a traditional and most respectful national etiquette of the Mongolian people) as a gift to Premier Zhou. Premier Zhou immediately drank it all and shook hands with Comrades Tsedenbal and Sambuu to express his gratitude.
    The first place the delegation visited was a large textile and shoe-making joint factory. It is said that the various sizes of leather boots and felt boots produced there can meet the needs of the country's one million people. The comrades who received us told us: on the green hillside opposite, there is a new large-scale comprehensive meat and oil factory, the products here not only meet the needs of the domestic people, but also can be exported in large quantities. Unfortunately, due to the short time, we were unable to go.
    The delegation then visited the National Resources and Culture Museum. This museum displays cultural relics of past dynasties, which is very educational. The specimens of animals, plants, and minerals produced throughout the country are listed in an orderly manner, making it easy for people to see the abundant resources within the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic.
    The Revolutionary History Museum was the last item visited by the delegation. The museum is the place where Marshal Choibalsan used to live and work. I saw that Premier Zhou and the comrades of the delegation attached great importance to every relic and photo of the revolutionary martyrs. In particular, the Soviet-Mongolian Treaty and the Chinese-Mongolian Treaty displayed in the glass box further illustrate how the government and people of the Mongolian People's Republic cherish their eternal friendship with the great Soviet Union and with the People's Republic of China.
    10. Returning from Thousands of Miles
    At noon on August 1, when the reception held by our embassy in the Mongolian People's Republic was still in progress, in order to adapt to the climate, we were notified in advance to board the plane and fly back to the capital of the motherland—Beijing, which had been nearly four months away. At this time, the comrades on the same plane naturally had their own feelings. As a reporter, I was wondering: what should I report to my compatriots and comrades?
    I felt that a series of unforgettable and fraternal images of friendship from Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow to Ulaanbaatar appeared before me again. I wish I could understand the language of every country, so that I could deeply understand and write about the full content of their peaceful construction and their shared interests with us in international affairs, rather than the above bits and pieces....
    I recalled Geneva. From the cheers of the people all over the world for the agreement reached on the Indochina issue, it can be seen how deeply the principle of peaceful consultation to resolve international disputes has penetrated the hearts of the people. I also thought of Foreign Minister Molotov, who had worked so hard. He said as soon as he got off the plane in Geneva: "It is impossible not to point out this important fact, namely: the representatives of all major powers—France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union—have recently participated in an international conference together for the first time in recent years." Today, only a small group of people like Dulles, who are obsessed with international division and war, are unwilling to recognize the great role played by the great People's Republic of China in international affairs. I also thought of Premier Zhou and the Chinese delegation who correctly implemented the peaceful foreign policy of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao Zedong in Geneva. From the huge repercussions caused by Premier Zhou's words and deeds internationally, it can be seen how we are "supported by justice" internationally, and how the world peace camp led by the Soviet Union is strengthening its strength every day.
    In the opening speech of the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong predicted: "...Our nation will henceforth be included in the big family of all nations in the world who love peace and freedom, working with courage and diligence, creating its own civilization and happiness, and at the same time promoting world peace and freedom. Our nation will no longer be a nation that is insulted. We have stood up. ...Our friends are all over the world."
    The development of history has proved how correct Chairman Mao Zedong's prediction is!
    On the afternoon of August 1, we returned to the embrace of the capital of the motherland, and Premier Zhou also returned safely two hours later. (To be continued)

### 日内瓦归来

    日内瓦归来
　  本报记者　吴文焘
    八、两天的飞行
    经过下午和夜里的大雨，到七月三十日早晨我们离开莫斯科时，云淡风轻，是以往一星期访问旅行中比较少有的好天气。由于气象的特殊，今年欧洲雨水奇多。在日内瓦，我们就听到欧洲第一大河——多瑙河流域的洪水警报；据说沿河城市水位之高，为百余年来所仅有。到了柏林，又听说易北河等泛滥成灾的消息。直到七月三十一日我们飞抵亚洲的乌兰巴托，那里的同志们也说草原上天天淫雨，今年雨水大过往年呢！
    从莫斯科到乌兰巴托这两天的行程里，苏联的同志们事先就为代表团妥善周到地安排好在那里吃早点，那里吃正餐和休息等，因之并无平时连续飞行的那种疲劳的感觉。
    卡桑是我们途中降落的第一站。当飞机一着陆，站上的负责同志就带着一位四十来岁的女医师到飞机上来，再三询问谁有什么不舒适，谁晕飞机……，直到了解每个人都没有问题才罢。他那和蔼可亲的态度，使我想起一九五二年冬天作为一个普通旅客在西伯利亚火车上的一件事来。
    夜里，我们的孩子发了高烧。列车上的医生同志检查后，认为有请小儿科专家再次诊断的必要。他看了看表，已经是夜里一点钟了。他告诉我：再过两个小时，就有一个停车十几分钟的车站，可以用电报通知附近市镇上的专家；说着，留下了几个药片，他就走了。两个小时以后，车子刚刚停稳了，果然一位不到三十岁的女同志把那满披雪花的头巾和大衣脱下来，走进我们的小车间，立即进行检查、打针、嘱咐如何照料等。她含笑地拍了拍孩子的通红的脸说：“宝宝，你很快就会好了！”又祝福我们一路平安，没等我们表示对她的衷心感谢，她就匆匆跳下车去，车子又徐徐开动了。借着站上的灯光，我看到在风雪交加的深夜里，那位可敬可爱的女同志一个人提着皮包离开了车站。
    这只是一个偶然的事例，却表现了苏维埃公民们忠于自己职责的高贵品质。这种品质是普遍于一切我所接触到的苏维埃人身上的，虽然我和他们大多数都是萍水相逢的。
    在伊尔库斯克到乌兰巴托这段路上，天气忽又阴霾四合，飞机时有颠簸。招待员叶利钦同志给我们解释为什么飞机会有时像坠入深渊一样，并说这是一种普通现象，免使飞行经验少的同志们有所忧虑。
    下午六点钟的时候，我们在乌兰巴托降落了。以泽登巴尔总理为首的蒙古人民共和国政府首长和群众团体的代表们，早已冒着雨在等候欢迎周总理，可是周总理的飞机在一小时多以后才从云层里出现。
    九、在“红色英雄”城
    下了飞机，周总理和代表团的几个同志就到背靠着山、满院树木的前乔巴山元帅的夏季别墅去小憩。我们住在离市区较远的一个新式的“乡庄”里。在这所两层楼的招待所里，蒙古人民共和国的同志们为我们准备得有想像不到的周到：从巧克力糖到矿泉水和酒，从面巾到牙刷、香水，从无线电收音机到信纸、电报纸……。一位专职的理发员同志怕是对我们有些感到失望了，因为同志们在她再四催促之下，还没有人抽时间去理发；负责招待我们的同志，唯恐我们因时间紧迫吃不好饭，就看着表说：“不要紧，还有五分钟，多吃些、多喝点吧！”
    当天晚上，周总理先拜会了泽登巴尔总理和大人民呼拉尔主席团主席桑布同志。大家接着随同周总理往谒蒙古人民的革命导师苏赫·巴托尔和乔巴山元帅墓，并献花圈致敬。陵墓在部长会议大厦前面，两侧是修得富丽堂皇的人民歌剧院和电影院……远望陶拉河谷，灯火闪闪，颇为壮观。蒙古人民共和国人民把自己的首都取名乌兰巴托（即“红色英雄”之意），是具有怀念革命先烈的深刻意义的。
    这以后，就是泽登巴尔总理为周总理和中国代表团所举行的盛大宴会和歌舞晚会。在所有这些活动里，以及第二天（八月一日）上午的参观里，泽登巴尔总理一直和周总理形影不离，异常亲密。在宴会上，大家连连为马林科夫主席、毛泽东主席和泽登巴尔总理的健康干杯，并祝我们台湾的同胞们早日得到解放。
    八月一日上午代表团出发参观前，桑布主席由泽登巴尔总理陪同到周总理的寓所来献“哈达”，并用金碗盛着马乳（据说这是蒙古人民的一种传统的最尊敬的民族礼节的表示），作为对周总理的礼物。周总理当即一饮而尽，并向泽登巴尔和桑布同志握手致谢不已。
    代表团首先参观的，是一个规模很大的纺织和制鞋的联合工厂。据说那里出产的各种尺寸的皮靴和毡靴，即可供应全国百万人民的需要。招待的同志们告诉我：在对面绿油油的山坡上，是一座新式的大型综合肉类和油脂工厂，这里的出品不仅供应着国内人民的需要，而且还能大量出口。可惜由于时间短促，我们没得前往。
    代表团接着参观的，是国家的资源文化馆。这里陈列着历代文物，颇富教育意义。这里把全国各地出产的动、植、矿物标本，井井有条地罗列起来，使人对蒙古人民共和国境内的丰富资源一目了然。
    革命历史博物馆是代表团参观的最后一个项目。博物馆就是原先乔巴山元帅居住和工作的地方。我看到周总理和代表团的同志们对革命先烈们的每
  一件遗物和遗照，都表示极其重视。特别是那陈列在玻璃盒中的苏—蒙条约和中—蒙条约，更说明蒙古人民共和国政府和人民是如何珍重他们与伟大苏联间、与中华人民共和国间的永恒的友谊的。
      十、万里归来
    八月一日中午，当我驻蒙古人民共和国大使馆所举行的招待会还在进行着的时候，为了适应气候的情况，我们就先期被通知登机，飞返别近四月的祖国首都——北京。这时，同机的同志们自然都有他们的感触的。作为一个记者，我在盘算着：我将向我的同胞们，同志们报道一些什么呢？
    我觉得面前又出现了从柏林、华沙、莫斯科直到乌兰巴托一系列令人难忘的、情同手足的友谊形象。我恨不能懂得每个国家的语言，以便深刻体会并写出他们在进行和平建设中、在国际事务上和我们休戚相关的全面内容，而不是上面的一鳞半爪……。
    我回忆起日内瓦，从全世界人民对于印度支那问题所达成的协议的欢呼中，可以看出和平协商解决国际争端的原则，是怎样地深入人心。我又想到劳苦功高的莫洛托夫外长来。他在日内瓦一下飞机就说：“不能不指出这一重要事实，即：所有的大国——法国、英国、美国、中华人民共和国和苏联的代表最近几年来首次共同参加一个国际会议。”今天，只有像杜勒斯那种醉心于国际分裂和战争的一小撮人，才不愿承认伟大中华人民共和国在国际事务上所起的巨大作用。我也想到在日内瓦正确执行中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的和平外交政策的周总理和中国代表团。从周总理的言论和行动在国际范围内所引起的巨大反响，可以看出我们在国际上是怎样的“有道多助”，以苏联为首的世界和平阵营，是怎样在天天增强自己的力量。
    在一九四九年中国人民政协第一届全体会议的开幕辞里，毛泽东主席曾预言说：“……我们的民族将从此列入爱好和平自由的世界各民族的大家庭，以勇敢而勤劳的姿态工作着，创造自己的文明和幸福，同时也促进世界的和平和自由。我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了。……我们的朋友遍于全世界。”
    历史的发展证明了毛泽东主席的预言是何等正确！
    八月一日的下午，我们回到祖国首都的怀抱，周总理也于两小时后安然归来了。　（续完）
