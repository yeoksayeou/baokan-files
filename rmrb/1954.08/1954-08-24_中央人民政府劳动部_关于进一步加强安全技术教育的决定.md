    Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government
    Decision on Further Strengthening Safety Technology Education
    As the nation enters a period of planned economic construction, production technology will continuously improve, newly built and expanded factories and mines will successively go into production, and new workers will continue to increase in large numbers. In order to guarantee the completion of production and construction tasks, avoid or reduce casualties, and implement the policy of safe production, it is extremely important for all factories and mining enterprises to strengthen safety technology education for cadres and workers, especially for new workers. Therefore, the following provisions are hereby made:
    I. Each factory, mine, and construction site must designate one of its main leading cadres to seriously take charge of leadership; and must establish a regular safety education system, formulate practical safety education plans, and clarify the responsibilities and work scope of all relevant parties in the factory, mine, or construction site for safety technology education, in order to ensure that this work can be carried out in a planned manner.
    II. Factories, mines, and construction sites should, according to the nature of production and technical equipment, and in combination with mass experience, formulate practical safety operation regulations for different types of work and procedures as one of the main contents of safety education.
    III. New workers must undergo safety education (factory entry education, workshop education, team/group education, etc.; team/group education should adopt the method of "responsible for teaching, responsible for learning"), and only after passing the examination are they allowed to operate independently.
    IV. When new production methods are adopted, new technical equipment is added, new products are manufactured, or workers are transferred to new jobs, workers must be given safety education on the new job positions and new operating methods.
    V. For existing workers, the emphasis should be on education about the safety operation regulations for their respective positions and other relevant safety regulations and systems.
    VI. Those engaged in hazardous work (such as blasting and electrical workers), in addition to the above education, must also undergo relevant special safety operation training before being allowed to operate.
    VII. For administrative and technical management cadres, the main focus should be on education about labor protection policies, laws and regulations, safety technology knowledge, and safety production work experience and lessons learned, generally adopting the method of leaders taking charge of organizing study.
    VIII. In order to ensure the effective implementation of safety education, each enterprise should, depending on the circumstances, stipulate that regular examinations or tests be held.
    The central industrial departments in charge should, in accordance with this decision, formulate safety education systems and measures suitable for the specific circumstances of each industry.
    The above points should be followed for reference by local state-owned, joint state-private, and private enterprises.

    在国家进入有计划的经济建设时期，生产技术将不断改进，新建、扩建的厂矿将陆续投入生产，新工人也将继续大量增加，为了保证生产和建设任务的完成，避免或减少伤亡事故，贯彻安全生产方针，各厂矿企业加强对干部和工人，特别对新入厂工人的安全技术教育是十分重要的。因此，特作下列规定：
    一、各厂矿、工地必须在主要领导干部中指定一人认真负责领导；并须建立经常的安全教育制度，制订切实的安全教育计划，明确厂矿、工地中各有关方面对安全技术教育的职责与工作范围，以保证这一工作能有计划地进行。
    二、厂矿、工地应根据生产性质及技术设备，结合群众经验，分别工种、工序订切合实际的安全操作规程，作为安全教育的主要内容之一。
    三、对新工人必须进行安全教育（入厂教育、车间教育、班组教育等，班组教育应采取包教包学的方法进行），在考试合格后方准独立操作。
    四、采用新的生产方法、添设新的技术设备、制造新产品或调换工人工作时，必须对工人进行新工作岗位和新操作法的安全教育。
    五、对原有工人应着重进行本岗位安全操作规程和其他有关的安全规程制度的教育。
    六、对从事危险性工作者（如爆破、电气等工人），除上述教育外，还必须进行有关的特殊安全操作训练后，始准操作。
    七、对行政、技术管理干部，主要应进行劳动保护政策法令、安全技术知识和安全生产工作经验教训等教育，一般可采用领导负责组织学习的方式进行。
    八、为使安全教育切实贯彻，各企业应斟酌情况，规定举行定期考试或测验。
