Chairman, fellow members:

According to the agreement reached at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference in February 1954, representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, and other relevant countries convened in Geneva starting April 26, 1954, to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina separately. Our Central People's Government supported this agreement and appointed me to lead the delegation to participate in this conference. The Geneva Conference concluded on July 21st. Now, I would like to report to the Central People's Government Committee on the results of the Geneva Conference and our country's current foreign policy.

(I)

Since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has repeatedly declared its willingness to establish and develop diplomatic relations with any country based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, and to consistently strive for the noble goals of world peace and human progress in international affairs. However, the American aggressive bloc is not reconciled to the fact that the Chinese people have overthrown the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique that it supported, and has consistently adopted a hostile attitude of war threats and armed intervention towards the 600 million liberated Chinese people.

In pursuit of world hegemony, the American aggressive bloc has consistently pursued a policy of strength through arms expansion and war preparation, and has continuously instigated the organization of various opposing military blocs with aggressive intent in Asia and Europe, in order to create international tensions and profit from them. Especially in Asia, their aggressive activities are even more blatant. The American aggressive bloc launched the war of aggression against Korea, intensified its intervention in the war in Indochina, and at the same time, occupied our territory of Taiwan. Now, the Korean War has long been stopped, and peace in Indochina has also been restored. The outcome of the Geneva Conference proves the victory of peaceful forces and the failure of war forces. However, the American aggressive bloc is not reconciled to this failure. They are stepping up their instruction and aid to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, conducting more rampant harassing and destructive warfare against the Chinese mainland and coastal areas, actively reviving Japanese militarism, and intensifying plans to organize the "Pacific Anti-Communist Military Alliance" and aggressive blocs in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, in an attempt to create new tensions in various regions of Asia. This aggressive policy of the American aggressive bloc is the root cause of the constant threats to peace in Asia and the world.

Therefore, in order to ensure peace and security in Asia and the world, it is necessary to shatter the American aggressive bloc's conspiracy to create new tensions and ensure that their aggressive policies continue to suffer failures. The tasks now before us are: to work hard with relevant countries to jointly ensure the thorough implementation of the Geneva Conference's agreements on restoring peace in Indochina, and to continue to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue; to resolutely liberate Taiwan and safeguard our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity; to consolidate and develop our country's peaceful and cooperative relations with various countries based on the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, and to strive to establish collective peace in Asia.

(II)

The outcome of the Geneva Conference has promoted the further easing of international tensions, but the conference encountered many obstacles and difficulties during its proceedings. These obstacles and difficulties mainly came from the United States government. The United States government and its puppet Syngman Rhee clique have consistently adopted a brutal and unreasonable attitude of sabotage towards the conference discussing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Finally, the United States government manipulated some of the countries participating in the conference to issue a so-called "Joint Declaration," which caused the conference to be interrupted, so that the task of peacefully resolving the Korean issue could not be achieved. In the conference discussing the Indochina issue, thanks to the joint efforts of most of the participating countries, the various obstacles created by the United States were overcome, and the agreement on restoring peace in Indochina was reached. Although there are still some areas in these agreements that are not entirely satisfactory, the achievements of the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina are significant. The failure to reach an agreement on the Korean issue does not diminish the importance of this achievement.

The Geneva Conference's agreements on restoring peace in Indochina were reached on the basis of France's recognition of the national rights of the Indochinese people. These agreements not only stipulate concrete methods for ending hostilities in the three Indochinese countries to end the eight-year war in Indochina and bring peace to the people of Indochina and the people of France, but also stipulate the principles for resolving the political issues of the three Indochinese countries. The principle of guaranteeing respect for the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia and not interfering in their internal affairs has also been recognized by the participating countries.

According to the Geneva Conference's agreement on the cessation of hostilities in the three Indochinese countries, after the ceasefire, the three countries of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia will not allow the entry of reinforcing foreign troops and military personnel as well as various weapons and ammunition from outside their borders, with the exception of weapons and ammunition needed for self-defense by Laos and Cambodia. The strict implementation of these agreements will ensure the stability of the Indochina ceasefire. The participating countries also unanimously agreed to invite India, Poland, and Canada to organize an international commission to monitor the implementation of the agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

According to the principles of the Geneva Conference on resolving political issues in Indochina, the three countries of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia will hold nationwide free elections within their respective prescribed time limits to achieve the unification of each country on a democratic basis. Vietnam will hold nationwide free elections in July 1956; Laos and Cambodia will hold nationwide free elections in 1955. The three Indochinese countries, based on the obligations undertaken at the Geneva Conference, will prohibit any foreign country from establishing military bases on their respective territories. These three Indochinese countries also undertake not to participate in any military alliances and not to allow themselves to be used to resume hostilities or serve aggressive policies. In this way, the people of the three Indochinese countries will be able to live peacefully and engage in peaceful construction on the land of their respective homelands.

At the same time, if these three Indochinese countries can develop friendly relations among themselves and between them and France on the basis of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, and establish peaceful and cooperative relations with their neighbors, then it will be possible to establish a region of collective peace in Indochina and its surrounding countries. If international conditions are favorable, such a region of collective peace will continue to expand, so that Southeast Asian and Asian countries can coexist peacefully without foreign interference.

The Geneva Conference was able to achieve such significant success as a result of the joint efforts of the people of Indochina and France, as well as peace-loving countries and people around the world, and primarily as a result of the long-term struggle of the Vietnamese people under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Soviet government's consistent policy of maintaining world peace and international cooperation played an important role in the Geneva Conference. The spirit of reconciliation shown by France and the United Kingdom at the Geneva Conference, and the efforts made by the countries participating in the Colombo Conference, especially India, in promoting the Indochina ceasefire, all contributed to the achievements of the Geneva Conference. The role played by the People's Republic of China in the Geneva Conference is universally recognized, and this role cannot be erased by the American aggressive bloc.

The reaching of the Geneva Conference's various agreements on restoring peace in Indochina does not equate to the implementation of these agreements. The United States government, even after the agreements had been reached at the Geneva Conference, still stated its unwillingness to join the participating countries in the common task of guaranteeing the restoration of peace in Indochina. It is clear that the American aggressive bloc will not allow the agreements reached at the Geneva Conference to be smoothly and thoroughly implemented. Recently, the American aggressive bloc has actively instigated Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and the Philippines, and has wooed the United Kingdom and France, and even attempted to persuade the Colombo countries, to organize the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group." It is not difficult to understand that the organization of this group is aimed primarily at China as its main enemy, and is intended to undermine the collective cooperation of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue. If certain relevant countries participate in this divisive action of the American aggressive bloc, this will endanger the common task of guaranteeing the restoration of peace in Indochina, and may undermine the implementation of the Indochina ceasefire agreement.

Therefore, we resolutely advocate that relevant countries must jointly guarantee the thorough implementation of the various agreements on restoring peace in Indochina, and resolutely oppose the American aggressive bloc's conspiracy to organize the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group" to undermine the Geneva agreements.

(III)

The achievements of the Geneva Conference prove that international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultation. Now, there are more and more people in the world who support the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, and the policy of strength through arms expansion and war preparation pursued by the American aggressive bloc has become increasingly unpopular. If all countries and people who desire peace adhere to peace and cooperation, oppose war and oppose the organization of opposing military blocs, international tensions can continue to be eased.

During the Geneva Conference, the relationship between the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom improved. This improvement will help increase the possibility of establishing normal relations between our country and Western countries. During this period, there have also been new developments in trade and cultural exchanges between our country and Western countries.

The Geneva Conference, having reached a principled agreement on resolving political issues in restoring peace in Indochina, has brought new hope for a political solution to the Korean issue. The reason why the Korean issue conference was interrupted was not because the Geneva Conference had no possibility of reaching a consensus on a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but because the United States government and its puppet Syngman Rhee clique refused consultation and feared reaching any agreement. Recently, they openly clamored for the dissolution of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and conspired to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, which further demonstrates that the United States has no intention of peacefully resolving the Korean issue. However, in any case, the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue has not been removed from the agenda. We firmly believe that it is entirely necessary to solve the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea as soon as possible under the conditions that guarantee the unification of Korea, and that guarantee peace in Asia and the world.

The American aggressive bloc is not only undermining peace and creating division on the Korean and Indochina issues, but also instigating the organization of opposing military blocs in the Far East, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, creating new tensions in Asia. However, what the people of Asian countries need is peace and cooperation, not war and hostility. At the Geneva Conference, the delegation of the People's Republic of China proposed that Asian countries should consult with each other and jointly strive to maintain peace and security in Asia by mutually undertaking corresponding obligations. This proposition of ours does not exclude any country.

During the recess of the ministerial meeting of the Geneva Conference, I was honored to accept the invitations of the Indian and Burmese governments and visited India and Burma, where I held talks with Prime Minister Nehru and Prime Minister U Nu, respectively. Joint statements were issued by China and India and China and Burma on June 28 and 29, 1954, respectively. In these two joint statements, the three governments unanimously agreed to use the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence as the basic principles guiding relations between China and India and China and Burma. We believe that these five principles of peaceful coexistence should equally apply to relations between all countries and to general international relations. When I met with President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the Sino-Vietnamese border to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, President Ho Chi Minh expressed that these five principles are fully applicable to consolidating and developing friendly relations among Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. We believe that if these five principles are endorsed by more countries, then even countries that were previously opposed to each other, the fear and suspicion existing among them will possibly be replaced by a sense of security and mutual trust. In this way, it will be possible to establish more and wider regions of peace in Asia; these regions will not become hotbeds for the American aggressive bloc to create wars and organize opposing military blocs. Our Central People's Government will adhere to this policy and make unremitting efforts to establish collective peace in Asia.

The Chinese people care about peace in Asia and are equally concerned about peace in Europe. After the Geneva Conference, the delegation of the People's Republic of China visited the German Democratic Republic. A communiqué on the talks between the Premiers of China and Germany was issued on July 25, 1954. In the talks, both sides unanimously held that the American rearmament of West Germany and Japan was not for the purpose of establishing the self-defense forces of Germany and Japan, but to threaten peace in Europe and Asia. Therefore, the struggle against the rearmament of West Germany and Japan has become the common task of all peace-loving people. As far as the European situation is concerned, the issue of the peaceful reunification of Germany is an extremely important issue. We resolutely oppose the American reactionary policy of reviving German militarism and long-term division of Germany, and fully support the great struggle of the entire German people for the peaceful reunification of Germany.

In order to ensure peace in Europe and create favorable conditions for the peaceful resolution of the German issue, the Soviet government proposed on July 24, 1954, to convene a conference of European countries to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. On August 4, the Soviet government also suggested holding a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States in August and September of this year to consult on convening a conference of European countries and the German issue. The government of the People's Republic of China fully supports these two proposals of the Soviet government. The American aggressive bloc's aggressive policy of creating opposing military blocs in Europe is completely contrary to the interests of European collective security. We hope that the people of European countries, after suffering the disasters of two world wars, will be able to enjoy a peaceful life. If a European collective security system can be established, it will not only be conducive to ensuring peace in Europe, but also conducive to ensuring peace in Asia and the world.

After visiting the German Democratic Republic, the delegation of the People's Republic of China also visited the Polish People's Republic, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Mongolian People's Republic. During the visit to these four fraternal countries, we deeply felt the growing strength of the fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and their strong unity; we saw with our own eyes the people of these fraternal countries building their own countries with unparalleled enthusiasm and selfless labor, and strengthening the forces for defending world peace. We firmly believe that with the increasing strength of the fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, with the strong unity among the fraternal countries, and with the joint efforts of peace-loving countries and people in the world, any act of aggression and threat of war can certainly be defeated.

(IV)

As mentioned earlier, the American aggressive bloc has always been hostile to the People's Republic of China. They have constantly attempted to carry out armed intervention and threats of war against China from the three fronts of Taiwan, Korea, and Indochina. Now, the armistice in Korea and the restoration of peace in Indochina have gradually eased tensions in Asia. Precisely because of this, in order to create new tensions, the American aggressive bloc is stepping up its efforts to use the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique that has fled to Taiwan to carry out harassing and destructive warfare against our mainland and coastal areas, in order to expand armed intervention.

Chiang Kai-shek, the public enemy of the Chinese people, and his traitorous clique are now entrenched in Taiwan, exploiting our Taiwanese compatriots, and colluding with American aggressors to carry out shameless traitorous activities. Under the instructions and with the assistance of American aggressors, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is increasingly rampantly carrying out harassing and destructive warfare against our southeastern coastal areas and islands, massacring our compatriots, plundering coastal fishermen, and dispatching and airdropping special agents to our mainland to carry out assassination work. This traitorous clique deceives and persecutes our overseas Chinese, plunders overseas Chinese property, and lures our overseas Chinese youth to serve as cannon fodder for them. This traitorous clique is looting and detaining ships from various countries coming to our country for trade, just like pirates. Relying on the protection of the American naval and air forces and the training of the American "Military Assistance Advisory Group," this traitorous clique is still reorganizing its troops and clamoring to prepare to attack the mainland,妄想 thereby restoring their heinous fascist rule and turning the whole of China into an American colony.

Since occupying Taiwan, the United States government has controlled Taiwan's military, political, and economic affairs, turning Taiwan into an American colony and a military base for attacking our country. The United States government forcibly stuffed the representative of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique into the United Nations to serve as the so-called representative of China. Recently, the American aggressive bloc and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are simultaneously conducting negotiations in Washington and Taipei, planning to conclude a so-called "Bilateral Treaty of Common Security." At the same time, the American aggressive bloc is attempting to piece together Japanese reactionary forces, the Syngman Rhee clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to organize the so-called "Northeast Asia Defense Alliance." The American aggressive bloc is even dispatching naval and air forces to constantly demonstrate and provoke incidents on our borders, supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's blockade of our coastal areas. On July 26 of this year, American military aircraft openly attacked our patrol aircraft over Hainan Island and shot down two of our planes. All this proves that after suffering repeated setbacks, the American aggressive bloc is resorting to desperate measures to be a long-term enemy of our 600 million people. These activities are clearly extremely serious provocative acts against the Chinese people and against peace-loving people in Asia and the world.

The government of the People's Republic of China once again declares: Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory, and will never allow the United States to occupy it, nor will it allow it to be placed under United Nations trusteeship. The liberation of Taiwan is China's sovereignty and internal affair, and no other country is allowed to interfere. Any treaty concluded by the United States government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique entrenched in Taiwan is illegal and invalid. If foreign aggressors dare to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, dare to infringe upon our country's sovereignty and undermine our country's territorial integrity, and dare to interfere in our country's internal affairs, then they must bear all the serious consequences of this act of aggression.

The countries participating in the Geneva Conference, in their relations with the three Indochinese countries, guaranteed to respect their respective sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity and not to interfere in their internal affairs. We believe that these principles should apply to the relations between all countries. China has no intention of invading the territory of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries invading China's territory. China has no intention of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries infringing upon China's sovereignty. China has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries interfering in China's internal affairs. China will never threaten the security of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries threatening China's security.

It should be pointed out that the American aggressive bloc's continued occupation of Taiwan, sheltering of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and carrying out armed intervention not only infringe upon our country's territorial sovereignty and interfere in our country's internal affairs, but also increase the threat of war in the Far East, intensify the international situation, and prevent China and other relevant countries from enjoying the benefits of peace. The recent unfortunate accident in which a British civilian aircraft was mistakenly shot down occurred in the environment of the American aggressive bloc continuing to create tensions in the Far East and sheltering the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's warfare against our coastal areas and islands. We sympathize with the victims of this unfortunate accident, and we believe that it is even more necessary to oppose the American provocative actions of armed intervention and threats of war in the Far East, because the American policy of aggression and the policy of war are the root cause of all disasters and misfortunes.

It should be pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique makes it their business to conspire to provoke a world war. This small handful of traitors are not only the public enemy of the Chinese people, but also the public enemy of all peace-loving people in Asia and the world. In order to further ease international tensions, in order to consolidate and expand the peaceful situation created by the Indochina ceasefire, and in order to implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the People's Republic of China must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a struggle to defend world peace.

Liberating Taiwan is the glorious historical task of our people. Only by liberating Taiwan from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitors, only by completing this glorious task, can we realize the complete unification of our great motherland, can we achieve the complete victory of the great cause of liberation of the Chinese people, and can we further guarantee peace and security in the Far East and the world.

All the people of our country and the People's Liberation Army must strengthen their work in all aspects, enhance vigilance, prevent complacency, overcome difficulties, and struggle to the end to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan and defending world peace!

### 在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上  周恩来总理兼外长的外交报告  一九五四年八月十一日

    在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上
    周恩来总理兼外长的外交报告
    一九五四年八月十一日主席、各位委员：
    根据一九五四年二月柏林四国外长会议的协议，由苏联、美国、法国、英国、中华人民共和国和其他有关国家的代表，从一九五四年四月二十六日起在日内瓦举行会议，分别讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题。我中央人民政府支持这一协议，并委派我率领代表团前往参加这一会议。日内瓦会议已在七月二十一日结束。现在，我就日内瓦会议的结果和目前我国的外交政策，向中央人民政府委员会提出报告。（一）
    中华人民共和国自成立以来，屡次宣布愿意根据平等、互利、互相尊重领土主权的原则，同任何国家建立和发展外交关系，并在国际事务中，坚持为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。但是，美国侵略集团，却不甘心中国人民推翻了它所支持的蒋介石卖国集团的反动统治，对获得解放的六万万中国人民一贯地采取战争威胁和武装干涉的敌对态度。
    为了追求世界霸权，美国侵略集团一贯地执行扩军备战的实力政策，并不断在亚洲和欧洲策动组织各种各样的以侵略为目的的对立的军事集团，以制造国际的紧张局势，便于从中取利。尤其是在亚洲，他们的侵略活动更加露骨。美国侵略集团发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，加紧干涉了印度支那的战争，同时，并侵占了我国的领土台湾。现在，朝鲜的战争早已停了，印度支那的和平也恢复了。日内瓦会议的结果，证明了和平力量的胜利，战争势力的失败，但是，美国侵略集团却不甘心于这一失败。他们正在加紧指使和援助蒋介石卖国集团，对中国大陆和沿海更加猖獗地进行骚扰性的和破坏性的战争，积极复活日本军国主义，加紧策划组织“太平洋反共军事同盟”及东南亚和中东的侵略集团，以图在亚洲各地区造成新的紧张局势。美国侵略集团的这种侵略政策，就是亚洲及世界的和平不断遭受威胁的根源。
    因此，为了保障亚洲及世界的和平和安全，必须击破美国侵略集团制造新的紧张局势的阴谋，使他们的侵略政策继续遭受失败。现在放在我们面前的任务就是：努力与有关国家共同保证彻底实现日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的各项协议，并继续谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决；坚决解放台湾，保障我国主权和领土的完整；根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，巩固和发展我国与各国的和平合作关系，并努力建立亚洲的集体和平。（二）
    日内瓦会议的结果，促进了国际紧张局势的进
  一步和缓，但是，会议在进行中却遭遇了不少的障碍和困难。这些障碍和困难主要地是从美国政府方面来的。美国政府和它的傀儡李承晚集团，对于讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的会议，一贯采取了横蛮无理的破坏态度。最后，美国政府更操纵参加会议的一部分国家，发表了一个所谓“共同宣言”，使会议陷于中断，以致未能实现和平解决朝鲜问题的任务。在讨论印度支那问题的会议中，由于大多数与会国家的共同努力，克服了美国方面所造成的种种阻挠，关于恢复印度支那和平的协议才得以达成。在这些协议中，虽然还有某些地方不能完全令人满意，但是，日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的成就是很大的。朝鲜问题没有达成协议并不能减低这一成就的重要性。
    日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议是在法国承认印度支那人民的民族权利的基础上达成的。这些协议不仅规定了印度支那三国停止敌对行动的具体办法，以结束印度支那的八年战争，将和平带给印度支那人民和法国人民，而且也规定了解决印度支那三国政治问题的原则。保证尊重越南、老挝和柬埔寨三国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整并对它们的内政不予任何干涉的原则，也获得了与会各国的承认。
    根据日内瓦会议关于停止印度支那三国敌对行动的协定，越南、老挝和柬埔寨三国在停战后将不从境外进入增援性的外国军队和军事人员以及各种武器和弹药，仅老挝和柬埔寨为自卫所需的武器和弹药不在此限。这些协议的严格实施将保证印度支那停战的稳定。与会各国并一致同意邀请印度、波兰和加拿大三国组织国际委员会，负责监察越南、老挝和柬埔寨停止敌对行动协定的实施。
      根据日内瓦会议关于解决印度支那政治问题的原则，越南、老挝和柬埔寨三国将在分别规定的期限内举行全国的自由选举，以实现各该国在民主基础上的统一。越南将在一九五六年七月内举行全国自由选举；老挝和柬埔寨则将在一九五五年内举行全国的自由选举。印度支那三国，基于在日内瓦会议上所承担的义务，将禁止任何外国在它们各自的领土上建立军事基地。这三个印度支那国家并承担义务不参加任何军事同盟，不容许被利用来恢复敌对行动或服务于侵略政策。这样，印度支那三国的人民就有可能在他们各自的祖国的土地上过和平生活并从事于和平建设。
    同时，这三个印度支那国家如果能在互相尊重领土主权的基础上发展它们之间的以及它们与法国之间的友好关系，并与它们的邻邦建立和平合作关系，那么，在印度支那以及它的周围的国家就有可能建立一个集体和平的地区。如果国际条件有利，像这样一种集体和平的地区就会继续扩大，使东南亚及亚洲国家都能和平共处，而不受外来的干涉。
    日内瓦会议能够获得如此重大的成就，是由于印度支那人民和法国人民以及全世界爱好和平的国家和人民从各方面共同努力的结果，并且首先是越南人民在越南民主共和国胡志明主席领导下长期奋斗的结果。苏联政府一贯坚持的维护世界和平和国际合作的政策在日内瓦会议中起了重要的作用。法国和英国在日内瓦会议上所表现的和解精神，参加科伦坡会议的国家、特别是印度在推动印度支那停战方面所作的努力，对于日内瓦会议所获得的成就，都是有贡献的。中华人民共和国在日内瓦会议中所起的作用是人所公认的，这种作用决不是美国侵略集团所能抹煞的。
    日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的各项协议的达成，并不等于这些协议的实现。美国政府在日内瓦会议已经达成协议时，还声明不愿同与会各国一起参加保证恢复印度支那和平的共同工作。很显然，美国侵略集团是不会让日内瓦会议所达成的协议顺利地彻底地付之实施的。最近美国侵略集团积极策动澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国和菲律宾，并拉拢英国和法国，甚至还企图劝说科伦坡国家，组织所谓“东南亚防御集团”。不难了解，组织这个集团是以中国为主要的敌对目标的，是为了破坏日内瓦会议与会各国在印度支那问题上的集体合作的。如果某些有关国家竟参加美国侵略集团的这个分裂行动，这就将使保证恢复印度支那和平的共同工作遭受危害，并将使印度支那停战协定的实施有被破坏的可能。
    因此，我们坚决主张有关国家必须共同保证彻底实现恢复印度支那和平的各项协议，坚决反对美国侵略集团策动组织所谓“东南亚防御集团”来破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋。（三）
    日内瓦会议的成就证明：国际争端是可以用和平协商的方法求得解决的。现在世界上赞成不同社会制度的国家和平共处的人已经越来越多，美国侵略集团所坚持的扩军备战的实力政策已经日益不得人心。如果一切愿意和平的国家和人民坚持和平和合作，反对战争和反对组织对立的军事集团，国际紧张局势是可以求得继续和缓的。
    在日内瓦会议期间，中华人民共和国和英国的关系得到了改进。这种改进，将有助于我国和西方国家建立正常关系的可能性的增长。在此期间，我国和西方国家间的贸易来往和文化交流，也有了新的发展。
    日内瓦会议在恢复印度支那和平的问题上，既已达成了解决政治问题的原则协议，这就为朝鲜问题的政治解决带来了新的希望。朝鲜问题会议之所以陷于中断，并非由于日内瓦会议没有可能对和平解决朝鲜问题取得一致意见，而是由于美国政府和它的傀儡李承晚集团拒绝进行协商，害怕达成任何协议。最近，他们公开叫嚣解散中立国监察委员会，阴谋破坏朝鲜停战协定，这就更加表明美国无意于和平解决朝鲜问题。但是，无论如何，和平解决朝鲜问题并没有从议程上抹掉。我们坚决认为，在保证有利于朝鲜的国家统一、有利于保障亚洲及世界和平的条件下从速解决朝鲜的和平统一问题，是完全必要的。
    美国侵略集团不但在朝鲜和印度支那问题上破坏和平，制造分裂，而且还在远东、东南亚和中东策动组织对立的军事集团，制造亚洲新的紧张局势。但是，亚洲各国人民所需要的，是和平和合作，而不是战争和敌对。在日内瓦会议上，中华人民共和国代表团曾经提出，亚洲国家彼此之间应该进行协商，以互相承担相应的义务的方法，共同努力维护亚洲的和平和安全。我们这一主张是不排斥任何国家的。
    在日内瓦会议的部长级会议休会期间，我奉命接受了印度政府和缅甸政府的邀请，访问了印度和缅甸，与尼赫鲁总理和吴努总理，分别举行了会谈。中印两国和中缅两国分别在一九五四年六月二十八日和二十九日发表了联合声明。在这两个联合声明中，三国政府一致同意以互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则作为指导中印和中缅之间的关系的基本原则。我们认为，这个和平共处的五项原则应该同样适用于各国之间和一般的国际关系之中。当我在中越边境会见越南民主共和国胡志明主席商谈恢复印度支那和平问题的时候，胡志明主席表示，这五项原则完全适用于巩固和发展越南、老挝和柬埔寨三国之间的友好关系。我们相信，如果这五项原则获得更多的国家的赞同，那么，即使是过去互相对立的国家，在它们中间存在着的恐惧和疑虑，也将有可能为安全感和互信所代替。这样，在亚洲就有可能建立起更多的和更广大的和平地区；这些地区就不致沦为美国侵略集团制造战争和组织对立的军事集团的温床。我中央人民政府将本此方针为建立亚洲的集体和平而作坚持不懈的努力。
    中国人民关心亚洲和平，同样关心欧洲和平。日内瓦会议结束后，中华人民共和国代表团访问了德意志民主共和国。中德两国总理在一九五四年七月二十五日发表了会谈公报。在会谈中，双方一致认为，美国重新武装西德和日本并非为了建立德国和日本的自卫力量，而是用以威胁欧洲和亚洲的和平。因此，反对重新武装西德和日本的斗争，成了所有爱好和平的人民的共同任务。就欧洲局势来说，和平统一德国问题是一个极为重要的问题。我们坚决反对美国复活德国军国主义和长期分裂德国的反动政策，并全力支持全德意志人民要求和平统一德国的伟大斗争。
    为了保障欧洲的和平，并为和平解决德国问题创造有利的条件，苏联政府在一九五四年七月二十四日提出召开一个欧洲国家会议，来讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。八月四日苏联政府又建议在今年八、九月间举行苏、法、英、美四国外长会议，就召开欧洲国家会议和德国问题，进行协商。中华人民共和国政府完全支持苏联政府这两个建议。美国侵略集团在欧洲制造对立的军事集团的侵略政策是与欧洲集体安全的利益完全背道而驰的。我们希望，欧洲国家的人民在遭受两次世界战争的灾难之后，能够享受和平生活。欧洲集体安全体系如能建立，将不仅有利于保障欧洲的和平，而且也将有利于保障亚洲及世界的和平。
    中华人民共和国代表团在访问了德意志民主共和国之后，还访问了波兰人民共和国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和蒙古人民共和国。在访问这四个兄弟国家的期间，我们深深地体会到以苏联为首的各兄弟国家的力量的壮大和它们之间的坚强团结；我们亲眼看到这些兄弟国家的人民以无比的热情和忘我的劳动在建设自己的国家，并加强保卫世界和平的力量。我们深信，有了以苏联为首的各兄弟国家的日益强盛，有了各兄弟国家间的坚强团结，有了世界上爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力，任何侵略行为和战争威胁是一定可以击败的。（四）
    如前所述，美国侵略集团一向是敌视中华人民共和国的。他们曾经不断企图从台湾、朝鲜、印度支那三个战线上进行对中国的武装干涉和战争威胁。现在，朝鲜的停战和印度支那和平的恢复已经使亚洲的紧张局势逐步趋于和缓。正因如此，美国侵略集团为了制造新的紧张局势，就更加加紧利用逃在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团，对我国大陆和沿海进行骚扰性的和破坏性的战争，以扩大武装干涉。
    中国人民的公敌蒋介石和他的卖国集团现在盘据台湾，压榨我台湾同胞，勾结美国侵略者，进行无耻的卖国活动。蒋介石卖国集团，在美国侵略者的指使和援助之下，对我国东南沿海地区和岛屿日益猖獗地进行骚扰性的和破坏性的战争，屠杀我国同胞，劫掠沿海渔民，并派遣和空投特务到我国大陆进行暗害工作。这个卖国集团对我海外华侨实行欺骗和迫害，掠夺华侨财产，引诱我华侨青年充当他们的炮灰。这个卖国集团完全像海盗一样劫掠和扣留各国前来我国通商的船舶。这个卖国集团依靠美国海空军的庇护和美国“军事援助顾问团”的训练，还在进行整编军队，叫嚣准备进攻大陆，妄想借此恢复它们的万恶的法西斯统治，把全中国变为美国的殖民地。
    美国政府自侵占台湾以来，就控制了台湾的军事、政治和经济，把台湾变成美国的殖民地和进攻我国的军事基地。美国政府把蒋介石卖国集团的代表硬塞在联合国里充当所谓中国代表。最近，美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团正在华盛顿和台北同时进行谈判，策划订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”。同时，美国侵略集团又在企图拼凑日本反动势力、李承晚集团和蒋介石卖国集团组织所谓“东北亚防御联盟”。美国侵略集团更出动海军和空军，不断在我国边境示威寻衅，支持蒋介石卖国集团对我国沿海的封锁。在本年七月二十六日，美国军用飞机竟公然在我海南岛上空攻击我巡逻飞机，并击落我机两架。这一切证明，美国侵略集团在受到了屡次挫败之后，竟不惜采取绝望的措施，来与我国六万万人民长期为敌。这些活动，显然是对中国人民和对亚洲及世界爱好和平的人民的极端严重的挑衅行为。
    中华人民共和国政府再一次宣布：台湾是中国神圣不可侵犯的领土，决不容许美国侵占，也决不容许交给联合国托管。解放台湾是中国的主权和内政，决不容许他国干涉。美国政府和盘据台湾的蒋介石卖国集团无论订立什么条约都是非法的，无效的。如果外国侵略者敢于阻止中国人民解放台湾，敢于侵犯我国主权和破坏我国领土完整，敢于干涉我国内政，那么，他们就必须承担这一侵略行为的一切严重后果。
    日内瓦会议与会各国在对印度支那三国的关系上，保证尊重它们各自的主权、独立、统一和领土完整并对它们的内政不予任何干涉。我们认为，这些原则应该适用于一切国家的关系之中。中国没有侵略别国领土的意图，也决不容忍别国侵略中国的领土。中国没有侵犯别国主权的意图，也决不容忍别国侵犯中国的主权。中国没有干涉别国内政的意图，也决不容忍别国干涉中国的内政。中国决不威胁别国的安全，也决不容忍别国威胁中国的安全。
    应该指出，美国侵略集团继续侵占台湾，庇护蒋介石卖国集团，进行武装干涉，不仅是侵犯我国领土主权，干涉我国内政，而且是增加远东战争威胁，紧张国际局势，使中国和其他有关国家不能享受和平利益。最近英国民用飞机误被击落的不幸事故，就是在美国侵略集团在远东继续制造紧张局势和庇护蒋介石卖国集团对我国沿海地区和岛屿进行战争的环境中发生的。我们同情这一不幸事故的遇难者，我们认为更有必要反对美国在远东进行武装干涉和战争威胁的挑衅行动，因为美国的侵略政策和战争政策是一切祸害和不幸的根源。
    应该指出，蒋介石卖国集团是以阴谋挑拨世界大战为他们的职业的。这一小撮卖国贼不仅是中国人民的公敌，而且是亚洲及世界各国一切爱好和平的人民的公敌。为了进一步和缓国际紧张局势，为了巩固和扩大由于印度支那停战而产生的和平局面，为了贯彻和平共处的五项原则，中华人民共和国必须解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。
    中国人民解放台湾的斗争就是保卫世界和平的斗争。
    解放台湾是我国人民光荣的历史任务。只有把台湾从蒋介石卖国贼的统治下解放出来，只有完成这个光荣的任务，才能实现我们伟大祖国的完全的统一，才能获得伟大的中国人民解放事业的完全的胜利，才能进一步地保障远东及世界的和平和安全。
    我全国人民和人民解放军必须从各方面加强工作，提高警惕，防止骄傲，克服困难，为完成解放台湾、保卫世界和平的光荣任务而奋斗到底！
