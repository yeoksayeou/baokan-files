Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 5th: Indian newspapers report that India has rejected invitations to attend meetings regarding the so-called "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" issue. Newspapers cited a statement made by an Indian government spokesman on the 2nd, saying that the Indian government's policy regarding the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" has been repeatedly and unequivocally stated publicly, and India remains opposed to "collective security treaties" like the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

Indian newspapers, in discussing India's reasons for refusing to participate in the establishment of a Southeast Asia group, pointed out that the planned "defense organization" might not actually be "defensive" but could be used for offensive purposes. Newspapers said that India believes the Western countries' efforts to establish such an organization in Asia will only exacerbate international tensions.

The "Times of India" wrote on the 3rd that India does not want the peaceful atmosphere generated after the Indochina armistice at the Geneva Conference to be threatened by any threats, force, or negotiations about force.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 5th: The Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, Sidik Djojosukarto, said in a speech on the 3rd that the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty is essentially a war preparation treaty, and Indonesia will not accept or participate in such an organization.

He said that the Indonesian Nationalist Party is very happy to welcome the Indochina ceasefire, as it is a step towards the cessation of hostilities, while the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization may go in the opposite direction.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 5th: Indonesian public opinion is fiercely criticizing the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization that the United States is stepping up its planning for.

The "Indonesian Torch" newspaper said in an editorial on the 4th that Indonesia will not participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization because if it joined, Indonesia would have to abandon its independent policy. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a tool of the United States to encircle its enemies in Asia, especially the People's Republic of China. Becoming a signatory to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization would mean joining the American bloc.

The "Indonesian Torch" went on to say, "Obviously, the goals of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are completely different from the goals of the Colombo Conference and are incompatible with the spirit of the resolution passed by the conference on May 2nd."

"Abadi" newspaper said on the 4th that all Indonesian political parties unanimously oppose joining any military treaty that violates Indonesia's independent policy, and Indonesia must refuse to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The newspaper said that the first consideration for Southeast Asian countries will be how to develop their countries economically. What they need most is not cannons, tanks, and bombers, but tractors, agricultural tools, etc., to build their countries and cultivate their land.

"Observer" newspaper welcomed Indonesia's refusal to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization on the 4th. It said that if Indonesia joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, it would have to abandon its independent policy. The newspaper believes that for the sake of Indonesia's interests, this independent policy must be firmly pursued.

An editorial in the "Indonesian News" commenting on the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc planned by the United States pointed out that the Indonesian people, like the people of other Asian countries, "are very familiar with the Americans' methods. It is clear that this bloc hides a serious danger to the Asian people. It is an aggressive bloc."

"Indonesian News" rejected the US proposal regarding Indonesia's participation in the Southeast Asia military bloc. It emphasized that Indonesia has another path: the friendly declaration between China, India, and Burma can serve as its model.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" said on the 4th that the United States' desire to restore the war is becoming increasingly frenzied. The newspaper said that our response should be to consolidate the achievements of the Geneva Conference, defeat every aggressive conspiracy of the warmongers, and defend and strengthen the cause of peace.

    印度政府发言人表示反对建立东南亚集团
    印尼舆论猛烈抨击美国拼凑战争集团的活动
    【新华社新德里五日电】印度报纸报道，印度已经拒绝要它参加关于所谓“东南亚公约组织”问题的会议的邀请。报纸引述印度政府发言人二日发表的话说，印度政府对于“东南亚公约组织”的政策已经屡次使人们无可怀疑地予以公开说明，印度仍然反对像“东南亚公约组织”这样的“集体安全条约”。
    印度报纸论述印度拒绝参加关于设立东南亚集团的理由时指出，策划中的这种“防御组织”也许实际上不会成为“防御性”的，而可能被用来达到进攻的目的。报纸说，印度认为，西方国家在亚洲竭力进行建立这种组织只会加剧国际紧张局势。
  “印度时报”三日写道，印度不希望在日内瓦会议达成印度支那停战以后所产生的和平气氛遭到任何威胁、武力或关于武力的谈判所破坏。
    【新华社雅加达五日电】印尼国民党主席西迪克·约约苏卡托在三日的谈话中说，所谓东南亚公约本质上是一个备战公约，印尼是不会接受或是参加这种组织的。
    他说，印尼国民党非常高兴地欢迎印度支那停火，因为这是走向敌对行动停止的一个步骤，而东南亚公约组织可能走相反的方向。
    【新华社雅加达五日电】印尼舆论猛烈抨击美国加紧策划中的所谓东南亚公约组织。
    “印尼火炬报”四日的社论说，印尼不会参加东南亚公约组织，因为要是加入了东南亚公约组织，印尼就不得不放弃它的独立政策。东南亚公约组织是美国的工具，为的是包围它在亚洲的敌人，特别是中华人民共和国。成为东南亚公约组织的签字国将意味着加入美国集团。
      “印尼火炬报”接着说，“显然，东南亚公约组织的目标是和科伦坡会议的目标完全不同的，而且是和会议在五月二日通过的决议的精神不相容的。”
      “永恒报”四日说，印尼各政党一致反对加入任何违反印尼独立政策的军事公约，印尼一定要拒绝参加东南亚公约组织。这家报纸说，东南亚国家首先考虑的将是如何在经济上发展它们的国家。它们最需要的不是大炮、坦克和轰炸机，而是拖拉机、农具等来建设它们的国家，耕耘它们的土地。
    “观察报”四日对印尼拒绝参加东南亚公约组织一事表示欢迎。它说，要是加入了东南亚公约组织，印尼就不得不放弃它的独立政策。这家报纸认为，为了印尼的利益，必须坚决奉行这种独立的政策。
    “印尼新闻”的社论在评论美国策划的东南亚侵略集团时指出，印尼人和亚洲其他国家人民一样，“很熟悉美国人的作法。很明显，这个集团隐藏着对亚洲人民的严重危险。它是一种侵略性集团”。
    “印尼新闻”拒绝美国所提关于印尼参加东南亚军事集团的建议。它着重指出，印尼有另一条道路：中国、印度和缅甸之间的友好声明可以作为它的榜样。
    印尼“人民日报”四日说，美国想恢复战争的愿望越来越疯狂了。报纸说，我们的答复应该是巩固日内瓦会议的成就，击败战争贩子的每一个侵略阴谋，并保卫和加强和平事业。
