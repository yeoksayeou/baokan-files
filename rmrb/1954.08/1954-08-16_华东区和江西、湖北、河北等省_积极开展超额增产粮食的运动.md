East China region's Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong and other provinces have suffered from natural disasters in some areas. After vigorous rescue efforts, most of the flooded areas have been saved. 30 percent of disaster areas in Anhui Province have begun replanting and changing planting, and more than 2 million mu of late rice crops in Jiangsu Province have been replanted. All 210,000 mu of disaster-stricken farmland in Zhejiang Province have been replanted. At present, these areas are taking disaster relief through production as the main task. The CPC Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu provincial committees issued instructions one after another from the end of July to the beginning of August to overcome disasters and strive for overproduction. The CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee called on farmers in the province to strive for overproduction of 600 million jin of grain. Many non-flooded areas in the province are under the leadership of party and government organs and cadres, launching a large-scale overproduction movement. The autumn season in non-disaster areas of Anhui Province, with mutual aid and cooperation as the center, launched an overproduction movement of 1.49 billion jin of grain. The Fujian Provincial Party Committee called on party organizations at all levels in the province to quickly mobilize the broad masses of farmers to carry out overproduction, striving to increase the yield per mu of autumn crops by about 7 jin compared with the original plan. Jiangsu Province's summer harvest has exceeded 700 million jin, and cadres and the masses still have great confidence in continuing to increase production by 120 million jin of grain. Shandong Province initially proposed an overproduction of 920 million jin in autumn. The above figures are estimated to increase further. In the overproduction movement, all localities are completing the task of increasing production by doing a good job in processing and fertilizing autumn fields, increasing the yield per unit area, expanding the planting area, planting more short-term crops, and careful harvesting. More than 120 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 28,000 mutual aid groups in Liu'an, Jinzhai, and Huoqiu counties in Liu'an Special District of Anhui Province, led individual farmers to intercrop corn, soybeans and other late autumn crops on more than 115,000 mu of soybean fields and sweet potato fields. As of August 6, three special districts of Anqing, Wuhu, and Liu'an have reclaimed wasteland and used blank land and fallow fields, totaling more than 1.28 million mu, to expand the planting area of late autumn crops.

The movement of increasing production and practicing economy and disaster relief through production has been widely launched throughout Jiangxi Province. In the disaster areas, farmers are vigorously fighting against water to seize land and rush to plant late autumn crops. In non-disaster areas, double-cropping rice is widely expanded and regenerated rice is cultivated to ensure overproduction of grain to support national economic construction and the people in the disaster areas. Guixi County, Shangrao Special District, proposed "replanting wherever the flood recedes in the disaster area, and strive to reduce production losses." The 7th district of Guixi County launched and organized farmers to launch a "shock rush planting week" in the whole district, and rushed to plant more than 160,000 mu of late rice in five days. Preliminary statistics from 13 counties including Nanchang and Gao'an in Nanchang Special District show that expanding double-cropping late rice, cultivating regenerated rice, and replanting and changing late rice can increase production by more than 368 million jin, which greatly compensates for the losses in agricultural production in the disaster areas. Farmers in Xingan County, Ji'an Special District, a non-disaster area, sent people to Ganzhou to negotiate the transportation of 30,000 jin of late-planted and fast-growing "Honggu seeds" to help farmers in waterlogged areas. Yugan County, Shangrao Special District, supported Yujiang County, a disaster area, with late rice seedlings that can be planted on 50,000 mu. At present, the broad masses of farmers in the province are striving to continue to implement the resolution on launching a campaign to increase production, practice economy and provide disaster relief adopted at the first meeting of the first People's Congress of the province.

The mutual aid and cooperative organizations in non-disaster areas of Hubei Province led the broad masses of farmers to respond to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, tap production potential, revise and re-formulate production plans, and launch a production increase campaign. All agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups have revised and re-formulated their plans based on their specific conditions by finding tricks and making detailed calculations. The mutual aid and cooperation organizations in Tumen Township, Yichang County, led the farmers in the township to calculate an increase in production. The township can cultivate more than 1,100 mu of regenerated rice, which can harvest more than 68,000 jin of grain, calculated at 60 jin of grain per mu. All agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups not only formulate their own plans to ensure the over-fulfillment of production increase tasks, but also help individual farmers formulate plans to strive for increased production and bumper harvests. After the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Suntian Township, Xianning County, formulated a plan to increase production by another 20%, it introduced its experience in tapping potential and formulating plans at the mutual aid and cooperation representatives meeting in the township. According to the situation in the township, the representatives formulated a plan to increase grain production by another 905,000 jin. Many mutual aid groups put forward the slogan of "do a good job in production and strive to transfer to the cooperative" and actively strive for a bumper harvest. The Xiejiayuan mutual aid group and the Yao Dahuai mutual aid group in Lianhe Township, Yidu County, have merged into a joint group. They originally planned to sell more than 8,000 jin of grain to the state after the autumn harvest. Now, in order to strive to transfer to the cooperative, they strive to increase production and plan to add another 4,000 jin of grain to sell to the state to support national industrial construction and the people in the disaster areas. In order to strive for increased production, many mutual aid and cooperative organizations have also taken the lead in launching challenge competitions to promote the production increase campaign. In Enshi Special District, seven counties and eight agricultural production cooperatives have launched challenge competitions to all agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in the special district. Farmers in various cotton-producing areas actively responded to the call of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to overproduce 260,000 dan of ginned cotton. Under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in various places, the management of cotton fields has been generally strengthened. Farmers in many cotton-producing areas have rationally applied top dressing to cotton fields. Cotton topping and pruning have also been promoted in many areas. Farmers in various cotton-producing areas have also purchased a large number of pest control drugs and machinery, and have generally launched pest control campaigns. Farmers in various cotton-producing areas are continuing to work hard to complete the task of overproduction.

In order to implement the emergency instructions of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to strive to overproduce 680 million jin of grain, 42 million jin of ginned cotton, and 22 million jin of oil crops, the Communist Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province and the people's governments at all levels in Hebei Province transferred more than 200 cadres, led by Ma Aimu, deputy director of the Rural Work Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Li Hengfu, deputy director of the Hebei Provincial People's Government Agricultural and Forestry Department, to Handan, Zhangjiakou and other special districts. In addition to holding emergency meetings to study and arrange work, the local committees and special offices of the Communist Party of China also transferred many cadres to the countryside to assist county and district cadres in helping farmers find ways to formulate plans. All counties have formed work groups composed of county and district cadres to divide up villages and contract to mobilize farmers. The supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Hebei Province are supplying farmers with more than 100 million jin of fertilizer and more than 400,000 jin of pesticides. The fertilizer supplied by the supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels can be used for nearly 6 million mu of crops for one top dressing, calculated at an average fertilization of 20 jin per mu (including chemical fertilizer). More than 400,000 jin of pesticides sold to farmers can be used by farmers to timely prevent and control pests during the flowering and boll-forming of cotton and the tasseling and seed-setting of corn and millet. The supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in the province have recently purchased a large number of late autumn vegetable crop seeds to supply farmers to replant late fields.

    华东区和江西、湖北、河北等省
    积极开展超额增产粮食的运动
    华东地区安徽、江苏、浙江、山东等省部分地区遭受自然灾害侵袭，经过大力抢救，绝大部分水灾地区已得到挽救。安徽全省受灾地区百分之三十开始补种和改种，江苏省两百多万亩晚稻作物已补种完毕，浙江省二十一万亩遭灾田地已全部补种停当。目前这些地区正以生产救灾为当前主要工作。中共浙江、安徽、福建、江苏等省委会都于七月底到八月初先后发出战胜灾害、争取超额增产的指示，中共浙江省委号召全省农民为超额增产六亿斤粮食而奋斗，该省不少非涝地区农民正在党政机关和干部领导下，展开大面积超额增产运动。安徽省非灾地区秋季以互助合作为中心，展开超额增产十四亿九千万斤粮食运动。福建省委号召全省各级党组织迅速动员广大农民开展超额增产，力争全省两千万亩秋季作物比原订计划每亩增产七斤左右。江苏省夏收已超过七亿斤，干部和群众对于继续增产一亿二千万斤粮食仍有很大信心。山东省初步提出秋季超额增产九亿二千万斤。以上数字估计还有增加。各地在增产运动中，都以作好秋田加工施肥、提高单位面积产量和扩大播种面积，多种短期作物以及细收细打等办法完成增产任务。安徽省六安专区的六安、金寨、霍邱三县一百二十多个农业生产合作社和两万八千多个互助组带动单干农民，在豆田、山芋田里间种玉米、?豆等晚秋作物十一万五千多亩。安庆、芜湖、六安等三个专区到八月六日为止，已开垦荒地和利用空白地、休闲田共一百二十八万多亩，以扩大晚秋作物的播种面积。

    增产节约生产救灾运动，在江西全省范围内广泛地展开了。在水灾区农民们正大力地与水争田抢种晚秋作物，在非灾区进行了广泛扩种双季稻和培育再生稻，保证超额增产粮食支援国家经济建设和水灾区人民。上饶专区贵溪县提出“灾区水退到那里就补种到那里，争取少减产”。贵溪县七区发动和组织农民在全区掀起了一个“突击抢种运动周”，五天时间就抢种了一万六千多亩晚稻。南昌专区的南昌，高安等十三个县的初步统计：从扩种双季晚稻，培育再生稻，改种补种晚稻就可以增产三亿六千八百多万斤，这样就大大的弥补了灾区农业生产上的损失。非灾区的吉安专区新淦县农民派人去赣州洽运晚栽快熟的“红谷种”三万斤，帮助水涝地区农民，上饶专区余干县以可栽五万亩的晚稻秧苗支援了水灾区余江县，目前全省广大农民为继续贯彻省首届第一次人民代表大会会议关于开展增产节约生产救灾决议而努力奋斗。

    湖北省非灾区的互助合作组织，带动广大农民群众，响应省委号召，挖掘生产潜力，修订和重订生产计划，开展增产运动。各农业生产合作社和互助组都根据自己的具体条件，通过找窍门算细账，修订和重订计划。宜昌县土门乡的互助合作组织带动全乡农民，算了一个增产账，全乡可以培育再生稻一千一百多亩，以每亩收谷六十斤计算，共可收六万八千多斤谷。各农业生产合作社和互助组，不仅把自己的计划订好，保证超额完成增产任务，并且帮助单干农民订好计划，争取增产丰收。咸宁县孙田乡先锋农业生产合作社订了再增产二成的计划后，在全乡的互助合作代表会上，介绍了他们挖潜力订计划的经验。代表们根据全乡的情况，订出再增产九十万零五千多斤粮食的计划。有很多互助组，提出了“搞好生产争取转社”的口号，积极争取丰产。宜都县联合乡谢家元互助组和姚大淮互助组，已合并成一个联组，他们原计划秋收后卖谷八千多斤给国家，现在为了争取转社，力争超额增产，计划再加四千斤谷卖给国家，以支援国家工业建设和灾区人民。为了力争增产，不少互助合作组织还带头发起挑战竞赛推动增产运动。在恩施专区，已有七个县八个农业生产合作社向全专区各农业生产合作社和互助组发起挑战竞赛。各产棉区农民积极响应中共湖北省委员会超额增产二十六万担皮棉的号召。各地在互助合作组织的带动下，普遍加强了对棉田的管理。很多产棉区农民对棉田合理施用追肥。棉花的整枝打杈也已在很多地区推行。各产棉区农民还购买了大批治虫药械，普遍开展了治虫运动。各产棉区农民正在继续努力，以完成超额增产的任务。

    为执行中共河北省委员会的力争超额增产六亿八千万斤粮食、四千二百万斤皮棉、两千二百万斤油料的紧急指示，中共河北省各级党委和河北省各级人民政府抽调二百多名干部，由中共河北省委员会农村工作部副部长马艾木、河北省人民政府农林厅副厅长李衡甫等率领，分赴邯郸、张家口等专区。各中共地方委员会、专署除召开紧急会议研究布置外，也抽调不少干部下乡，协助县、区干部具体帮助农民想办法订计划。各县都由县、区干部组成工作组，分片分村，包干发动。河北省各级供销合作社正把一亿多斤肥料，四十多万斤农药供应农民。各级供销合作社供应的肥料，按每亩平均施肥二十斤（其中有化学肥料）计算，可供近六百万亩农作物施一次追肥。将卖给农民的四十多万斤农药可供农民及时地防除在棉花开花结铃和玉米、谷子吐穗结籽时的虫害。全省各级供销合作社最近并采购了大批晚秋蔬菜作物种籽供应农民补种晚田。
