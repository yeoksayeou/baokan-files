Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 10th. The water level at Wuhan Customs rose again on the 10th, reaching 29.41 meters at 5:00 PM, an increase of 13 centimeters compared to the same time yesterday. After the water level dropped from 29.31 meters to 29.28 meters yesterday morning, it remained stable for eight hours before rising again in the evening. There were also temporary periods of stability lasting three to five hours this morning and afternoon, with a rise of 3 centimeters between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM. This rise is mainly due to the arrival of the fifth flood peak of the Han River in Wuhan, as well as the rising water in the new levee section above Wuhan on the Yangtze River yesterday. At 8:00 AM today, the water level generally fell from Lizhuang in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to Jianli in the middle reaches. The new levee also began to fall today, dropping by 1 centimeter compared to the same time yesterday. In addition, there is a downward trend in water levels from Wuxue in the middle reaches to Datong in the lower reaches. Only Wuhan and Huangshi reported rising water levels in the entire Yangtze River basin today.

    The levees of Wuhan have been continuously raised and reinforced. Despite today's high water level, the elevation of the levees still remains 5 decimeters to about 1 meter above the water surface, and further reinforcement and raising projects are continuing. The city's 100,000-strong flood prevention army is launching a large-scale campaign for merit to finally defeat the flood. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on the 6th to carry out a campaign for merit in the flood prevention struggle, and the Wuhan Municipal Flood Control Headquarters promulgated regulations on rewards and punishments for flood prevention workers, which have been warmly supported by the vast majority of flood prevention workers. Flood prevention organizations at all levels, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and active elements participating in flood prevention have expressed their determination to the Party and the people of the city to overcome the flood and have set out plans for merit. Many flood prevention sections also solemnly held rallies to strive for the final victory in flood prevention, and some units have also established "merit books" with designated personnel responsible for recording merits. The vast number of residents of the city and various organizations, troops, factories, and schools are also actively supporting the flood prevention front, demonstrating a high degree of socialist spirit.

    武汉水位上涨到二十九点四一公尺
    十万防汛大军开展规模壮大的立功运动
   【新华社武汉十日电】十日武汉关的水位再次上涨，到下午五时已涨到二九点四一公尺，比昨天同一时间涨了一公寸三公分。当昨天上午水位由二九点三一公尺回落到二九点二八公尺以后，曾经平稳了八个小时，到了晚上又开始上涨。在今天早晨和午后也曾出现连续三、五小时暂时的平稳，下午三时至五时连涨了三公分。这次涨水主要是由于汉水第五次洪峰到了武汉，长江武汉以上新堤段昨日涨水也来到了。今天上午八时，从长江上游李庄起至中游监利段仍普遍落水。新堤今天也开始由涨转落，较昨日同一时间落一公分。另自中游武穴至下游大通也呈落水趋势。长江全流域今天只有武汉、黄石市两站水位报涨。
    武汉市的堤防经过连续的加高加固，虽出现了今天的高水位，但堤防的标高仍保持着高出水面五公寸以上至一公尺左右，进一步加固加高的工程也还在继续进行着。全市十多万防汛大军为了最后战胜洪水，正在开展规模壮大的立功运动。中共武汉市委员会已在六日发出了在防汛斗争中开展立功运动的指示，武汉市防汛总指挥部颁布了防汛员工奖惩条例，都得到了广大防汛员工的热烈拥护。各级防汛组织和参加防汛的共产党员、青年团员以及群众积极分子，纷纷向党和全市人民表示战胜洪水的决心，订出了立功计划。许多防汛工段还隆重举行了争取防汛最后胜利的誓师大会，有些单位还建立了“记功簿”，设有专人负责记功。全市广大居民和各机关、部队、工厂、学校也都踊跃支援防汛前线，表现了高度的社会主义精神。
