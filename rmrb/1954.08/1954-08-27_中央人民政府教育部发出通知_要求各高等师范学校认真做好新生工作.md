    The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, with particular concern that new students of higher normal schools can report and enroll on time, issued a notice on the 21st, requiring all higher normal schools to conscientiously carry out new student work. The notice emphasized: Doing a good job in new student work is a necessary measure to stabilize the learning mood of new students and smoothly carry out teaching work. All schools must, based on past experience in welcoming new students and in light of the specific situation of this year's new students, make various preparations before the new students enroll, and promptly launch the work of welcoming new students after enrollment, especially focusing on properly arranging the lives of new students and strengthening political and ideological education and professional ideological education, so that the mood of new students can quickly stabilize and enter normal learning as soon as possible. The notice pointed out: The administrative负责人 (responsible people) of each school must personally lead, organize a certain amount of manpower, and, in close coordination with the CCP organization, the Communist Youth League, the trade union, and the student union in the school, mobilize all teachers, students, and staff in a planned and led manner to warmly welcome new students through various forms, and give them sufficient care in their lives, so that new students can feel the warmth of the school family. The notice also required that through the work of welcoming new students, new students should be inspired to correctly understand the position and role of higher normal education in national construction, and the erroneous ideas of belittling being a teacher should be criticized to initially establish professional ideology.
    The notice also pointed out that each school should help new students overcome learning difficulties and improve learning effectiveness, in order to strengthen their learning confidence. In particular, necessary assistance should be given to graduates of worker-peasant rapid middle schools, social educated youth, on-the-job cadres, and elementary school teachers in their studies.
