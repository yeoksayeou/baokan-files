    When Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, spoke, the audience applauded warmly.

    Liao Chengzhi said: Chinese youth are very happy that so many peace-loving young friends have come to our country, allowing us to express our friendly feelings towards the youth of all countries. We Chinese youth feel happy and proud to have friends all over the world.

    Liao Chengzhi said that Chinese youth will always be loyal to the cause of peace and to solidarity and friendship with the youth of all countries. For the sake of peace and friendship, Chinese youth never spare their energy. Any cause that is beneficial to peace and to the unity and friendship of youth is a cause to which Chinese youth will devote all their efforts.

    Liao Chengzhi said that Chinese youth resolutely support all the resolutions of this meeting and will make unremitting efforts to realize them. Dear friends, please believe that Chinese youth will surely hold even higher the banner of peace and friendship, strive to enhance friendship with the youth of all countries, and resolutely, together with the people of the whole country, liberate the sacred territory of our motherland, Taiwan, and work hard in production, work, and study in different posts to strengthen the forces of world peace.

    When Liao Chengzhi finished his speech, the whole audience stood up and applauded enthusiastically, shouting "Long live peace and friendship!" for a long time.

    When Bruno Bernini, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, was invited to speak, the venue resounded with applause, expressing a warm welcome. Bernini said that the resolutions passed and the declarations issued at our Council meeting are in line with the aspirations of the broad masses of young people in all countries to strive for a better life. We call on all youth organizations and young people around the world to unite and strive for the thorough realization of these resolutions. Bernini said that Chinese youth have made significant contributions to the common cause of peace and friendship for youth all over the world. The unforgettable days we have spent with you in Beijing have left us with extremely deep impressions, which we will take back to our countries. We once again express our gratitude to you and promise that after returning home, we will work and fight even better.

    Bernini's speech was constantly interrupted by thunderous applause. When he finished speaking, the whole audience, in rhythmic applause, once again cheered "Long live peace and friendship!"

    Next, the audience warmly welcomed Soviet youth representative Romanovsky's speech with prolonged applause. He said that the three resolutions passed and the declarations issued by the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council meeting in Beijing have great significance for youth organizations and all young men and women in all countries. The purpose is to unite a broader mass of young people to fight for peace, for friendship between the people of all countries, and for national independence. The task now is to do everything possible to absorb more young people to implement and realize these resolutions. Romanovsky said that a great, unbreakable, and eternal friendship connects the youth of the Soviet Union and China. Soviet youth will always be loyal to the friendship with the great, peace-loving, and hardworking Chinese youth, and will continue to develop and consolidate this fraternal friendship. We know that the more consolidated our friendship is, the greater contribution we can make to the struggle of the younger generation for peace and a bright future.

    Vietnamese youth representative Ho Truc spoke. He said: The unity and friendship between peace-loving people and youth of the world is like a steel wall, and any saboteur who dares to touch it will be defeated. Vietnamese youth will unite more closely around President Ho Chi Minh and strive to consolidate peace and complete the independence, unification, and democracy of the motherland.

    A French youth representative said in his speech that in the eyes of the people of the world, New China is a tremendous force for peace. French youth demand to live a happy life in an independent, prosperous, and peaceful France, and they are fighting for these legitimate demands. He said that the armistice in Indochina once again proves that all international problems can be resolved through negotiation.

    Korean youth representative Kim Sa-yun spoke. He said that Korean youth can say through their own personal experience: without national independence, there is no right and happiness for youth. To win the rights and happiness of youth, it is necessary to obtain the true independence of one's own country, and for this, it is necessary to carry out the struggle against the forces of aggression. All of us Korean youth are convinced that the youth of colonial and dependent countries will also defeat imperialism and achieve brilliant victories.

    British representative Robert Dowell McInnes said in his speech that all of us in the delegation are committed to taking the truth about New China back to our own country. There are new things everywhere here, everywhere there is construction, reconstruction, planning, and progress, creating a rich, peaceful, and safe life for the Chinese people.

    An Indian youth representative said in his speech that for Indian youth, Beijing is a symbol of victory against foreign rule. Beijing symbolizes freedom, symbolizing the freedom achieved after shaking off the suffering, backwardness, and terror imposed on the Chinese people in the past. Beijing symbolizes the strong and unremitting heroic fighting will against foreign rule. We believe that the friendship between the 400 million people of India and the 600 million people of China and the peace-loving people of the world will shatter the evil attempts of American warmongers and will open a path to a bright future for our younger generation.

    An American representative said in his speech that we have not had time to visit Beijing more extensively, but the busy streets, the construction of new houses and new hospitals, have already left us with a powerful impression – you are a people working for peace. Our youth assure you that we are working for a democratic America, an America that will live in a peaceful world with all nations.

    German representative Werner Lamberz said that in our struggle, we are proud to have the support of peace-loving youth all over the world, especially the youth of the Soviet Union and the so powerful Chinese youth.

    Also speaking at the celebration were Chilean representative Napoleon Toler Arasonna, Iranian representative Tehrani, Senegalese representative Babacar Bangura, Spanish representative Raimundo, etc. They repeatedly thanked the Chinese people for their hospitality, were inspired by the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people, and cheered for peace. Their speeches were warmly welcomed.

    Next, Jacques Denis, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, spoke. At this moment, the whole audience stood up and applauded warmly. Denis said that we are about to return to our respective countries, and what we are taking back is an even more determined will to win the victory of our common cause, so that the people of all countries can live freely and equally in peaceful coexistence, and so that young people can have a bright future. Among us, among the guests you have entertained, there are young people with various different views. I believe everyone will sincerely say: here live outstanding young people, who have broad prospects for development and love the friendship of all the people of the world.

    The last to speak at the celebration was Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. He said, our respected friends from various countries, have given us tremendous encouragement. We know that the encouragement of our friends from various countries is their hope for us. We Chinese youth will certainly contribute all our strength to our common cause. We Chinese youth love peace, let us once again express to our friends from various countries that Chinese youth will fight to the end for the cause of world peace. We Chinese youth love the youth of all countries, let us once again express to our friends from various countries that Chinese youth will fight to the end for the cause of unity of the youth of the world.

    During Hu Yaobang's speech, the audience continuously applauded enthusiastically and cheered. At this moment, 350 Young Pioneers ran onto the stage and presented flowers to the representatives of various countries. Countless waving flowers on the venue formed an ocean of flowers, and countless peace doves flew in the azure sky. Huge balloons with the emblem of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, with huge banners "Celebrating the successful conclusion of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council meeting in Beijing" and "Long live the great unity of the youth of the world" rose into the sky. At this moment, the audience was in jubilation, and in rhythm with the applause, the whole audience sang the song "People of the World are of One Heart".

    The enthusiastic celebration, full of youthful friendship, showed that Chinese youth will always be loyal to the cause of unity of the youth of the world and will always be the most loyal and reliable friends of the youth of all countries.

    美国代表在讲话中说，我们还没有来得及更多地参观北京，但是忙碌的每一条街道，都在建造新房子、新医院，这已经给我们留下了强有力的印象——你们是为和平而进行工作的人民。我们的青年向你们保证，我们努力为一个民主的美国而工作，这个美国会与所有的国家一起相处在和平的世界里。
