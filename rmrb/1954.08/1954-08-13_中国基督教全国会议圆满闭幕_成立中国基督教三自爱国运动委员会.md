Xinhua News Agency, August 12th—The Chinese National Christian Conference was held from July 22nd to August 6th at the Beijing Congregational Church. At this conference, 232 representatives from 62 Chinese Christian churches and organizations gathered together to summarize the achievements of the past four years of the Chinese Christian Three-Self (self-governance, self-support, self-propagation) patriotic movement against imperialism, discussed future guidelines and tasks, and established a national leading body for the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Chinese Christianity. At the meeting, all Christian attendees were jubilant about the unprecedented unity within Chinese Christianity and the achievements made by Chinese Christians in breaking away from imperialist control and building their own religious endeavors.

Prior to the opening of the conference, the representatives held an opening worship service, praying for the smooth progress of the conference. At the opening ceremony, all the representatives elected Wu Yaozong, Chen Jianzhen, Wu Yifang, Chen Chonggui, Jiang Changchuan, Cui Xianxiang, Ding Yuzhang, Zhu Guishen, Xie Yongqin, Qi Qingcai, Bao Zheqing, Tu Yuqing, Deng Yuzhi, Jia Yuming, Li Chuwen, Yu Yun, Xiong Zhenpei, Jiang John, Wang Zizhong, Jiang Yizhen, and 15 others to form the presidium. Liu Liangmo, the Deputy Secretary-General of the conference, read out congratulatory letters and telegrams from Christian churches and organizations in various regions to the conference; the representatives also welcomed and celebrated the news of the agreement reached on the Indochina peace restoration issue with enthusiastic applause.

At this conference, the representatives listened to Wu Yaozong's work report on the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Chinese Christianity over the past four years and conducted thorough discussions. The conference unanimously affirmed the achievements of the anti-imperialist patriotic movement carried out by Chinese Christians over the past four years. The conference emphasized that the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Chinese Christians over the past four years has dealt a major blow to the forces of imperialism, especially American imperialism, which used Christianity for cultural and political aggression in China. Chinese Christianity is now transforming into a religious undertaking managed by Chinese Christians themselves. Facts have proven that various denominations of Chinese Christianity have united under the common goal of anti-imperialism and patriotism. Chinese Christian churches and organizations have basically shaken off the control of imperialism and are gradually becoming religious organizations presided over by Chinese Christians themselves. A total of more than 410,000 Christians across the country signed a declaration entitled "The Path of Chinese Christianity's Efforts in the Construction of New China." Foreign missions have ended, imperialist elements have left the country, and foreign subsidies previously received by domestic Christian churches and organizations have been largely cut off; church schools, hospitals, and relief agencies run by imperialists have been taken over. The vast number of Christians have received patriotic education, increased their awareness of anti-imperialism and patriotism, and participated in various anti-imperialist patriotic movements and movements to defend world peace. The unity among various denominations, pastors, and believers within the church has been increasing day by day, and the church has shown a new atmosphere. In recent years, many model workers and other patriotic individuals have emerged among Christians, and many Christians have also been elected as representatives to people's congresses at all levels. The conference unanimously agreed that the ability of representatives from more than 60 churches and organizations across the country to gather together fully demonstrates the unprecedented unity within Chinese Christianity.

After thorough discussions, the conference believed that all denominations of Chinese Christian churches should further unite under the banner of the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, continue to carry out and deepen the anti-imperialist patriotic Three-Self movement, and, together with the people of the whole country, abide by the constitution and laws, implement the general task of the country's transition period, and actively participate in various national construction undertakings and various patriotic movements and movements to defend world peace. The representatives unanimously stated that they would heighten their vigilance and combat all conspiracies by imperialism, especially American imperialism, to continue to use Chinese Christianity for aggression. At the meeting, Jiang Changchuan, Sun Pengxi, Jiang Yizhen, Cui Xianxiang, Xie Yongqin, Wu Yifang, Shan Letian, Qi Qingcai, Zhu Guishen, and 13 others spoke successively. They unanimously supported the convening of this conference and felt excited about the achievements of the anti-imperialist patriotic movement over the past four years; they expressed particular satisfaction with the spirit of democracy and unity reflected in this conference.

At the meeting, after full deliberation and discussion, the representatives unanimously agreed to establish a leading body named the "Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Chinese Christianity," and elected Wu Yaozong, Chen Jianzhen, Wu Yifang, Chen Chonggui, Jiang Changchuan, Cui Xianxiang, Ding Yuzhang, and 132 others as members. The conference also passed the "Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao," the "Resolution on Supporting the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China," the "Resolution Condemning American Imperialism for Aggressing Against China and Disrupting Peace," and four other resolutions.

Chen Qiyuan, leader of the Religious Affairs Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and He Chengxiang, Director of the Religious Affairs Department of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, were invited to attend the conference. Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, was invited to give a political report to the conference. Zhang Bojun, Standing Committee Member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, gave a report on the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, and He Chengxiang gave a speech on issues related to religious policy.

During the conference, the representatives engaged in short periods of spiritual reflection every day. After the closing of the conference, all the representatives held a thanksgiving worship service with joyful hearts.

    会议经过充分讨论，认为今后中国基督教会所有教派应在反帝爱国运动的旗帜下进一步团结起来，继续开展和深入反帝爱国三自运动，和全国人民一道，遵守宪法和法律，实行国家过渡时期总任务，积极参加国家各项建设事业和各种爱国运动及保卫世界和平运动。到会代表一致表示：要提高警惕，打击帝国主义特别是美帝国主义企图继续利用中国基督教来进行侵略的一切阴谋。会上，江长川、孙鹏翕、蒋翼振、崔宪详、谢永钦、吴贻芳、单乐天、戚庆才、竺规身等二十二人先后发言，他们一致拥护这次会议的召开，并为四年来反帝爱国运动的成绩而感到兴奋；特别对这次会议所体现的民主团结的精神表示满意。
