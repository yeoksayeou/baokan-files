    Actively Carry Out Construction in Rainy Weather
    Most basic construction projects are outdoor operations, subject to the limitations of natural conditions. Rainy days and winter prevent construction. In recent years, the implementation of factory-based construction has moved a large portion of the work indoors for pre-fabrication, reducing the amount of outdoor work and accelerating project progress. Some regions have organized winter construction, which has also gained a significant number of workdays. However, rainy-day construction has remained an unresolved issue. Whenever it rains, construction has to stop, and after the weather clears, there is a rush to catch up, which affects the balance of construction, delays the progress of basic construction, and causes serious losses of national manpower and resources.
    According to meteorological data from 1953, the average annual rainy period in forty-seven cities across the country is one hundred days. In eighteen cities south of the Yangtze River, the average annual rainy period is about one hundred and sixty-four days. In Beijing, the rainy period reaches sixty-five days annually. It is clear that if work is completely stopped on rainy days, a great deal of construction time will be lost. Especially since this year's basic construction tasks are more demanding than last year's, and rainfall is higher than in previous years, many units have not completed their original plans for the first half of the year. The third quarter has become the most critical construction season, and the third quarter is also a rainy season. If the progress of construction continues to be constrained by rain, it is very likely that this year's basic construction plan will not be completed.
    Our basic construction workers have never shown fear of rainy weather, and stories of working in the rain are common. The Changsha Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Changsha Municipal Construction Party Committee saw the possibility of organizing rainy-day construction from the stories of some construction workers working in the rain. They actively organized and led it, affirmed rainy-day construction, and summarized some experiences for promotion, which secured a significant number of effective construction workdays. Recently, the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering issued a notice to promote rainy-day construction based on the experience of Changsha. Changchun, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places have begun to organize rainy-day construction. The results of these places' practices prove that Changsha's experience is practical and feasible. In order to gain more construction time in the third quarter and lay a solid foundation for the completion of the annual plan, the Party committees and construction enterprises in other places should also quickly learn from this experience and actively promote rainy-day construction.
    Rainy-day construction is a new topic for construction enterprises, and the Party organizations in various localities and enterprises must strengthen political and ideological work to eliminate the doubts and concerns of some cadres and employees. Some cadres now adopt a negative attitude because rainy-day construction requires the addition of rain protection equipment, which will increase costs. It should be explained to them that although rainy-day construction increases some costs, it accelerates progress, reduces idle time, and is completely in line with the principles of economic accounting. Some people dislike the trouble of rainy-day construction. These people should be educated to recognize that doing anything well is troublesome, and that stopping work on rainy days and rushing to catch up on sunny days is even more troublesome. Some workers believe that it is not easy to meet the quotas in rainy weather, or even think that they can get 75% of their allowance for not working in the rain, and are happy to rest. This is an erroneous individualistic idea that must be strengthened through education to raise their class consciousness.
    It is necessary to ensure project quality and construction safety in rainy-day construction. Working conditions are more difficult in rainy weather. If precautions are not taken, quality accidents and work-related injuries are very likely to occur, resulting in losses of manpower and resources. When promoting rainy-day construction, all localities should identify the key to ensuring project quality and construction safety based on the specific construction projects, formulate specific measures, and educate all employees to strictly abide by them. Certain projects that are not easy to carry out in rainy weather, such as foundation backfilling, should be avoided. Construction must be resolutely stopped when strong winds affect construction safety.
    Time is now pressing. Those who have not started to promote rainy-day construction should do so immediately. Those who have already implemented rainy-day construction should also conduct an inspection and take necessary improvement measures to prevent accidents and strive for more effective construction workdays.

    积极进行雨天施工
    基本建设工程大部分是露天作业，受着自然条件的限制，雨天和冬季都不能施工。近年来，各地推行了工厂化施工，很大一部分工作物移然室内预先制造，减少了露天作业的工作量，加快了工程进度；某些地区组织了冬季施工，也争取了很大一部分工作日。但是，雨天施工还始终是一个没有解决的问题。每逢雨天，不得不停止施工，天晴后又不得不赶工突击，既影响施工的均衡性，延缓了基本建设的进度，也造成国家人力物力的严重损失。
    根据一九五三年气象资料的记载，全国南北四十七个城市平均全年雨期占一百天，长江以南十八个城市全年平均雨期约有一百六十四天，北京雨期全年也达六十五天。由此可见，如果雨天一概停工，将会耽误多少施工时间。特别是今年的基本建设任务比去年繁重，雨量又比往年多，很多单位上半年没有完成原订的计划，第三季度已成为最紧张的施工季节，而第三季度恰是多雨的季节，如果继续让雨水束缚施工的进展，就极有可能无法完成今年的基本建设计划。
    我们的基本建设工人，从来没有对雨天表示过畏惧，冒雨施工的事迹屡见不鲜。中共长沙市委、中共长沙市建筑党委从一些建筑工人冒雨施工的事迹中，看到组织雨天施工的可能性，积极去组织它，领导它，把雨天施工肯定下来，并总结出一些经验，加以推广，争取了很大一部分施工有效工作日。最近，中央建筑工程部根据长沙市的经验，发出了推行雨天施工的通报，长春、上海、南京等地已开始组织雨天施工。这些地方实践的结果，证明长沙市的经验是切实可行的。为了争取第三季度有更多的施工时间，以便在第三季度给全年计划的完成打下巩固的基础，其他地方的党委及建筑企业也应当迅速学习这个经验，积极推行雨天施工。
    雨天施工是建筑企业一个新的课题，各地方和企业的党组织必须加强政治思想工作，消除某些干部职工的怀疑和顾虑。现在有些干部因为雨天施工要添置防雨设备，会增大成本，因而采取消极态度。应该向他们说明：雨天施工虽然增加一部分费用，但雨天施工加速了进度，减少了窝工，是完全合乎经济核算原则的。有的人嫌雨天施工麻烦，对这些人应教育他们认识把任何一件事情做好都是麻烦的，而且雨天停工，造成晴天赶工突击更要麻烦。有的工人认为雨天不易达到定额，甚至认为雨天不做工，反正可拿百分之七十五的津贴，乐得歇歇。这更是一种错误的个人主义的想法，必须加强教育，提高他们的阶级觉悟。
    在雨天施工中必须保证工程质量和施工安全。雨天施工的作业条件是比较困难的，如果不防患于未然，就极有可能发生质量事故和工伤事故，造成人力物力的损失。各地在推行雨天施工时，应该根据具体工程对象，找出保证工程质量和施工安全的关键所在，订出具体措施，教育全体职工严格遵行。某些不易在雨天施工的工程，如基础回填土工程等，应该避免雨天施工，遇有大风过境影响施工安全时必须坚决停止施工。
    现在时间已经紧迫，没有着手推行雨天施工的应立即推行，已实行雨天施工的也应进行一次检查和采取必要的改进措施，以防止发生事故，和争取更多的施工有效工作日。
