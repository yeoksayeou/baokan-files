(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 24th) "Pravda" correspondent I. Filippov today published a commentary on the bill passed by the U.S. Congress on August 19th to ban the activities of the American Communist Party.

　　Filippov said: This bill was passed in an atmosphere of unbridled anti-communist hysteria. Throughout the past week, while the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives were busy debating this bill, the congressmen, acting on the orders of their masters—the American monopoly capitalists—fully demonstrated their eagerness to be the first to strike at everything progressive and advanced in the United States. Democratic and Republican congressmen, one after another, proposed amendments and supplements to this reactionary bill, wanting to compete with each other in the movement to suppress the civil rights of the American people. During the debate, even the most basic parliamentary procedural rules were disregarded.

　　Filippov said: U.S. congressmen were in such a hurry to pass this reactionary bill that they held meetings to discuss the first draft of the bill before they even received the printed version of the bill. The final version of the bill on August 19th was put to a vote in the House of Representatives without any debate. When this bill was passed in the U.S. Senate, the atmosphere of hysteria and fanaticism was the same. Filippov emphasized that this new "legislative action" by the U.S. Congress has indeed broken all records of lawlessness and arbitrary rule. Even some U.S. congressmen had to admit this. For example, Senator Kefauver said that in American history, no one has ever been banned from activity because of his political beliefs.

　　Filippov continued that the passage of this latest pro-fascist bill by Congress has aroused the anger of all sectors of American public opinion, who believe that this is a threat to the civil rights of all the American people.

　　For example, the American Labor Party issued a statement stating that the anti-communist and anti-union bill is a measure aimed at establishing a trade union exactly like Hitler's "Labor Front."

　　Some groups hostile to the Communist Party also criticized the bill. The American Civil Liberties Union said in a letter to Congress that the passage of this bill by Congress is very harmful to the civil rights of Americans.

　　The "Daily Worker" pointed out in an editorial that the bill passed by Congress is not only aimed at the Communist Party and the American labor movement, but also at all Americans whose opinions are inconsistent with McCarthy and other American reactionaries.

    “真理报”记者评美国国会通过法西斯法案
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日电：“真理报”驻纽约记者伊·费利波夫今天就美国国会八月十九日通过的禁止美国共产党活动的法案发表评论。
    费利波夫说：这个法案是在肆无忌惮的反共歇斯底里气氛中通过的。在整个上星期中，当美国参众两院忙于辩论这个法案时，依照他们的主子——美国垄断资本家——的吩咐办事的议员们十足地表现出他们要争先恐后地打击美国一切前进和进步的东西。民主党和共和党议员们一个接一个地对这个反动法案提出修正和补充，要在压制美国人民的公民权利的运动中互相竞争。在辩论过程中，甚至连最基本的议会程序规则也不顾了。
    费利波夫说：美国议员们急急忙忙地要通过这个反动法案，因此他们还没有接到这个法案的印本前就开会讨论这个法案的初稿。八月十九日的法案最后定稿在众议院中没有进行任何辩论就提付表决了。当这个法案在美国参议院中通过时，歇斯底里和狂热的气氛也是一样。费利波夫强调说，美国国会的这种新的“立法行动”的确打破了无法无天和专横统治的一切纪录。连某些美国国会议员也不得不承认这一点。例如，参议员克弗维尔说，在美国历史上，从来没有一个人由于他的政治信仰而被禁止活动。
    费利波夫继续说，国会通过这个最近的亲法西斯法案后已引起了美国各阶层舆论的愤怒，他们认为这是对美国全体人民的公民权利的威胁。
    例如，美国劳工党发表一项声明，认为反共和反工会法案是一个目的在于成立跟希特勒的“劳工阵线”一模一样的工会的措施。
    敌视共产党的某些团体也批评这个法案。美国民权保障联盟在给国会的信中说，国会通过这个法案对于美国的公民权利是非常有害的。
    “工人日报”在社论中指出，国会通过的这个法案不但针对共产党和美国工会运动，而且针对一切意见跟麦卡锡和美国其他反动分子不一致的美国人。
