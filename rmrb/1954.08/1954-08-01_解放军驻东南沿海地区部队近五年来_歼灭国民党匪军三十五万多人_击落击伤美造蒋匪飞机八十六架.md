Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch: After the liberation of mainland China, the remnant Kuomintang bandit gangs who were driven out of the mainland entrenched themselves on Taiwan Island and certain other islands, and continued to be enemies of the people of the whole country under the protection of the United States. In June 1950, the U.S. government launched a war of aggression against Korea, threatening China's security; at the same time, it openly sent armed forces to invade China's territory of Taiwan, obstructing the Chinese people from liberating their own territory; and using Taiwan as a military base, it stepped up the equipment and training of the remnant Kuomintang army, preparing for armed aggression. In the past five years, under the equipment, training, and instigation of American military personnel, the remnant Kuomintang land, sea, and air forces have continuously harassed coastal areas, looted foreign merchant ships trading with China, and sent armed agents to infiltrate the mainland for sabotage. The People's Liberation Army stationed in the southeast coastal areas has resolutely defended the safety of the motherland and the people in the past few years, continued to liberate the islands entrenched by the remnant Kuomintang bandit troops, annihilated a large number of enemies, and dealt a heavy blow to the remnant Kuomintang bandit troops. According to incomplete statistics, the comprehensive results of the past five years are as follows:
	From October 1949 to June 1954, in our army's operations in the southeast coastal area, we wiped out the remaining bandits in the coastal provinces, and liberated important strategic islands such as the Zhoushan Islands, Shengsi Islands, Xiamen Island, Hainan Island, and Wanshan Islands, as well as 46 other islands, annihilating Kuomintang bandit troops (including remnant Kuomintang land, sea, and air forces, as well as airborne and landed armed agents, paratroopers, etc.) totaling 352,526 people, including 50,410 killed and wounded, 224,727 captured, and 77,389 bandit troops who surrendered; shot down or damaged 86 American-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes, including 48 American-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes shot down, 38 American-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes damaged, and 4 Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes that defected or revolted; sunk or damaged 36 Chiang Kai-shek bandit ships, and captured 307 ships; our army also seized some other materials from the remnant bandit troops.

   【新华社三十一日讯】全国大陆解放后，被人民赶出大陆的国民党残余匪帮，盘踞台湾岛和其他某些岛屿，在美国庇护下继续与全国人民为敌。一九五零年六月，美国政府一面发动侵略朝鲜的战争，威胁我国的安全；一面公然派遣武装力量侵占我国领土台湾，阻挠我国人民解放自己的国土；并以台湾作为军事基地，加紧装备、训练国民党残余军队，准备武装侵略行动。近五年来，在美国装备、训练和美国军事人员指使下，国民党残余陆、海、空军，不断侵扰沿海地区，劫掠与我国通商的外国商船，并派遣武装特务潜入大陆进行破坏。中国人民解放军驻东南沿海地区的陆、海、空军，几年来坚决地保卫祖国大陆和人民的安全，继续解放国民党残余匪军盘踞的岛屿，歼灭了大量敌人，给予国民党残余匪军沉重打击。据不完全统计，五年来综合战绩如下：
    自一九四九年十月到一九五四年六月，我军在东南沿海的作战中，肃清了沿海各省残匪，并解放了舟山群岛、嵊泗列岛、厦门岛、海南岛、万山群岛等重要战略岛屿和其他岛屿共四十六处，歼灭国民党匪军（包括国民党残余陆、海、空军以及空降和登陆的武装特务、伞兵等）三十五万二千五百二十六人，内毙伤五万零四百一十人，俘掳二十二万四千七百二十七人，匪军投诚七万七千三百八十九人；击落击伤美造蒋匪飞机八十六架，内击落美造蒋匪飞机四十八架，击伤美造蒋匪飞机三十八架，蒋匪飞机投诚和起义四架；击沉击伤蒋匪舰艇三十六艘，俘获船艇三百零七艘；我军并缴获残余匪军其他物资一部。
