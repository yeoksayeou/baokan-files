    Sichuan Province Issues Autumn Harvest and Autumn Planting Loans
    People's Banks in various parts of Sichuan Province issued more than 35 billion yuan in agricultural loans for the autumn harvest and autumn planting in July. Suining and Jiangjin Prefectures, after issuing a batch of summer famine relief loans in June, issued another 10 billion yuan in loans in July to help farmers purchase farm tools and draught cattle. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Luxian and Longchang Counties received loans from the state bank to purchase improved threshing machines. In the second district of Rong County, more than 200 farmer households received loans from the state bank and bought back 53 head of draught cattle in addition to a batch of farm tools. Many farmers are planning to feed their cattle well and sell more grain to the state.

    四川省发放秋收秋耕贷款
    四川省各地人民银行在七月份发放了三百五十多亿元秋收秋耕农业贷款。遂宁、江津两专区在六月份发放了一批夏荒贷款以后，七月份又发放一百亿元贷款，帮助农民购买农具、耕牛。泸县、隆昌不少农业生产合作社和互助组得到国家银行贷款，购买了改良打谷机。荣县第二区有二百多户农民得到国家银行的贷款，除买了一批农具以外，还买回耕牛五十三头。许多农民计划着要把耕牛喂好，多打粮食卖给国家。
