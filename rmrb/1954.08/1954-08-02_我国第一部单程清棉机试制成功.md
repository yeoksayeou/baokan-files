China's first single-process cotton opener has been successfully trial-produced by the state-owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, based on Soviet blueprints. The single-process cotton opener is smaller in size and requires less floor space than the old-fashioned two-process cotton opener, which can save a lot of capital construction investment for newly-built cotton textile factories. Its production efficiency is also higher than the old-fashioned cotton opener. The cotton laps produced are more uniform than those of the old-fashioned cotton opener, and the dust and debris are removed more cleanly.

Starting in August, the factory will produce this machine in batches according to plan. Soon, China's own manufactured single-process cotton openers and complete sets of single-process cotton opening systems will be installed in the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, and other newly-built cotton textile factories in China.

    我国第一部单程清棉机试制成功
    国营郑州纺织机械厂根据苏联的图样，试制我国第一部单程清棉机成功。单程清棉机比旧式的二道清棉机体积小，占地面积小，可以给新建棉纺织厂节省很多基本建设投资；它的生产效率也比旧式清棉机高，出的棉卷比旧式清棉机的均匀，尘土杂物除的也干净。
    从八月份起，该厂就要有计划地成批生产这种机器。不久以后，在国营郑州第三棉纺织厂、国营北京第二棉纺织厂和我国其他新建棉纺织厂中，将安装起我国自己制造的单程清棉机和单程清棉系统的全套设备。
