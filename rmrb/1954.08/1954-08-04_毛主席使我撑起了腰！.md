    "Chairman Mao Enabled Me to Stand Upright!"
     Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xu Ben
    When ships from Shanghai or Chongqing arrive at the Wuhan docks, the first thing that catches the attention of passengers is the huge clock tower of the Wuhan Customs House, standing on the bank of the Yangtze River in Hankou. People clearly remember that inside this clock tower, imperialists, with the support of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, once controlled our inland river navigation rights for a long time, carrying out the thieving activities of plundering the wealth of our people. An old man of about fifty, with white hair and beard, said to the reporter with a face full of excitement: "These fellows have finally been driven away by us!" He was obviously very pleased by the consolidation of the achievements of the people's revolution mentioned in the "Preamble" of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.
    This old man is called Zhou Junchen. He has been working as a "messenger" in this building since 1926. We walked onto a veranda facing the rolling river, and he said with great emotion: "In the past, how could someone like us come to this veranda!"
    The Wuhan Customs House (formerly known as the Jianghan Customs House) used to be controlled by imperialists. For more than 20 years, imperialists endlessly dumped their countless luxuries and large quantities of rotten waste into our inland areas, while looting and transporting away our important materials. At that time, ships flying the flags of imperialist countries sailed domineeringly on the Yangtze River, strangling our inland river shipping industry. This semi-colonial picture of that year left a painful impression on Zhou Junchen, who came from a poor peasant background. He told me about the scenes of that year and his own suffering experiences. In his life as a "messenger," he endured year after year the rude scolding of "beast," "pig," and other terms that should not be uttered by people in any civilized country; he was also beaten many times by "civilized canes." Once, he was innocently injured by these "foreigners" and wanted to ask for leave to recuperate, but not only was it impossible, but he also had to pay a fine of two silver dollars and face the threat of "dismissal." Zhou Junchen said: "There is no end to such suffering."
    Life since the founding of New China has given Zhou Junchen great comfort in both spirit and material terms. Because of his hard work, he was promoted to a national cadre in 1952. He originally did not know many characters, but now he has become an excellent student. He happily told me about his learning progress and said that he would be studying algebra in the next semester. He has many children; his wife has given birth to eleven children. Before liberation, some of these children starved to death, and some were sent to Catholic churches run by imperialists and then disappeared. Now, the seven remaining children are all doing well. In order to take care of him, the state moved his whole family from dilapidated shacks to the new customs dormitory. He said:
  "Comrade, what can I say? These houses used to be only for 'foreigners' and 'senior staff' to live in!" In recent years, Zhou Junchen has received a lot of subsidies from the state, such as subsidies for families with many children, education subsidies, and medical subsidies, which he cannot even count. Now, Zhou Junchen's children are also in school, and his eighteen-year-old son graduated from Nanjing Geological School last year and has been assigned to work in a certain place in Gansu. He was particularly happy when he mentioned this. He said: "Chairman Mao enabled us to stand upright, and gain freedom and happiness. The draft constitution stipulates the construction of a socialist society, which will make our lives even happier. I am very happy to dedicate my child to the state's geological work, and I will hand over my children to the state one by one." When he talked about himself, he said: "Although my work is small, it is also part of building socialism. I do not want to rely solely on the state's care. For the sake of socialism, I will work hard in my own work and fulfill my responsibilities as a citizen."

    “毛主席使我撑起了腰！”
     新华社记者　徐奔
    当来自上海或重庆的轮船驶抵武汉码头时，最先引起旅客们注意的是矗立在汉口江边上的武汉关巨大的钟楼。人们清楚地记得，就在这座钟楼里面，帝国主义者在蒋介石卖国集团的支持下，曾经长期控制我国内河航行权，进行掠夺我国人民财富的强盗勾当。一位年约五十岁的须发花白的老人满脸兴奋地对记者说：“这班家伙终于被我们撵跑了！”中华人民共和国宪法草案“序言”里所说的巩固了人民革命的成果显然使他十分愉快。
    这位老人叫做周俊臣。从一九二六年起，他就在这座大楼里当“信差”。我们走上一个面对着滚滚江水的洋台上，他很感慨地说：“早先，我们这样的人哪能到这个洋台上来啊！”
    武汉关（原名江汉关）过去是被帝国主义控制的。二十多年来，帝国主义者把他们无数的奢侈品和大宗霉烂的废物无休止地倾销到我国内地，而把我国重要的物资劫运出去。那时长江江面上飘扬着帝国主义国家旗帜的船只，横行霸道地来往行驶，扼杀了我国内河航运事业。当年这幅半殖民地的图画，在这位贫农出身的周俊臣的脑海里留下了痛苦的印象。他向我诉说了当年的景象和自己的苦难的经历。在他当“信差”的生活里，他长年累月地忍受了丝毫不是文明国家里的人所应该说得出口的
  “畜生”、“蠢猪”一类粗鲁的责骂；他也曾多次挨过“文明棍子”的毒打。有一次，他无辜地被这班“洋人”打得受了伤，想要请假休养，不但不可能，而且还要罚两块现洋，并受到“开除”的威胁。周俊臣说：“像这样的痛苦是说不完的。”
    新中国成立以来的生活使周俊臣在精神上和物质上都得到很大的欣慰。由于他努力工作，在一九五二年就被提拔为国家的干部。他原来识字不多，现在却已成为一个优秀的学员。他很高兴地告诉我关于他的学习进度，并且说他将在下学期学习代数。他是一个多子女的人，他的爱人曾生下了十一个孩子。解放前，这些孩子有的饿死，有的送到帝国主义办的天主堂里以后，就没有了下落。现在，留下的七个孩子都过得很好。国家为了照顾他，把他的全家从破烂的茅棚里搬到海关新宿舍。他说：
  “同志，这叫我怎么说呢？这些房子以前都只是‘洋人’、‘上等职员’才能住的！”这几年来，周俊臣得到国家不少的补助，什么多子女困难补助、教育补助、医药补助等，连自己也说不清。现在，周俊臣的子女也上了学，他的一个十八岁的男孩去年已在南京地质学校毕了业，并已被分配到甘肃某地工作。提起这件事，他特别高兴。他说：“毛主席使我们撑起了腰，得到了自由和幸福。宪法草案规定建设社会主义社会，这将使我们的生活更幸福。我把我的小孩献给国家的地质工作很高兴，我还要把我的小孩一个个都交给国家。”当他谈起自己的时候，他说：“我的工作虽小，可也是建设社会主义的一部分。我不希望光靠国家的照顾。为着社会主义，我要在自己的工作中下劲干，尽一个公民的责任。”
