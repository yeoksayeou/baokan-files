Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee was held in an expanded session on the afternoon of the 11th. Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai delivered a diplomatic report at the meeting (full text to be published separately). The meeting then discussed the diplomatic report. Those who spoke were Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Bojun, Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Guo Moruo, Chen Qiyou, Zhou Jianren, Xu Deheng, and Luo Longji. In their speeches, they unanimously agreed with and supported Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report, believing that the peaceful foreign policy consistently pursued by our country and the task of liberating Taiwan, as proposed in the report, are completely correct, and the people of the whole country should unite and work together for this.

    Zhang Zhizhong pointed out in his speech that the diplomatic history of old China is a history of shame and pain. The great diplomatic achievements made by our country's delegation, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, at the Geneva Conference have completely changed the past situation of being bullied. The status and role of the new China as a major power have been recognized by the world. Therefore, the people of the whole country are immensely delighted. Regarding the issue of liberating Taiwan, Zhang Zhizhong said that this is entirely China's internal affair. The traitorous and reactionary clique headed by Chiang Kai-shek, in collusion with the American aggressors, has usurped Taiwan, which is intolerable to the Chinese people. For this reason, the people of the whole country must strengthen all aspects of their work and fight for the liberation of Taiwan and the defense of national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

    Zhang Bojun said that continuing to implement the peaceful foreign policy and liberating Taiwan are the glorious tasks that the Chinese people must resolutely accomplish. In the past, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people achieved victory in the revolutionary struggle and great achievements in national construction. In the future, as long as the people of the whole country are of one heart and one mind, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, further strengthening unity and vigilance, they are fully confident and have the strength to liberate Taiwan and safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

    Li Jishen said that the various achievements made at the Geneva Conference were a great victory for peace over war, and also another great victory for the Chinese people after overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek's criminal rule, driving out foreign aggressors, and achieving victory in the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by our government have taken root in the hearts of the people. We will continue to consolidate and develop our peaceful and cooperative relations with countries around the world based on the above-mentioned five principles, and strive to work with relevant countries to ensure the complete implementation of the various agreements of the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina. Li Jishen continued, now, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is still colluding with the American aggressors, occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan, and constantly harassing our coastal areas, which is intolerable to the liberated Chinese people. In order to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we must resolutely liberate Taiwan.

    Huang Yanpei said that the successful conclusion of the Geneva Conference has given the peace forces an advantage, and the aggressive forces are becoming increasingly isolated. The principle of peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems has become the common demand of the people of the world. After the Geneva Conference, the people of our country will resolutely work with relevant countries to completely implement the various agreements reached at the Geneva Conference. We must resolutely oppose the American aggressors' conspiracy to instigate the organization of opposing military blocs; at the same time, in order to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we must resolutely liberate Taiwan. This is an acute struggle, and the people of the whole country should heighten their vigilance, strengthen unity, and do a good job in all aspects to win the final victory of the liberation war.

    Guo Moruo said that the Geneva Conference overcame various obstacles from the US side and finally achieved great success. Through this conference, our country's international status has been increasingly enhanced, and the peace-loving people of the world have even greater expectations of our country. This is a glorious thing, and at the same time, it has increased our country's responsibility in international affairs. We should guard against arrogance and rashness, strengthen domestic and international unity, work hard to build our country, and enhance our strength in order to make more contributions to safeguarding world peace. In order to finally complete the national liberation cause, liberating Taiwan is the historical task incumbent upon the people of our country. We firmly believe that with the active support of the people of the whole country, the ever-victorious and invincible Chinese People's Liberation Army will surely be able to successfully complete this glorious task.

    Chen Qiyou said that the Geneva Conference has successfully concluded, but the American aggressors are not reconciled to failure. They continue to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandits to occupy our territory of Taiwan, and instigate the organization of various opposing military blocs, creating international tension. For this reason, the people of the world must heighten their vigilance and resolutely oppose the American conspiracy to undermine peace. The Chinese people should continue to unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely liberate Taiwan, in order to realize the final victory of the liberation cause and safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

    Zhou Jianren, in his speech, congratulated the achievements of the Geneva Conference and the efforts of our country's delegation. He then said that liberating Taiwan is the common will of the people of the whole country. If the American aggressors are determined to interfere in our country's internal affairs, they will eat their own bitter fruit. In order to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan, the people of the whole country should unite more closely and do a good job in all aspects.

    Xu Deheng, in his speech, first congratulated the victory of the Geneva Conference. When talking about the issue of liberating Taiwan, he said that this is a historical task to be completed by the people of our country. The government's decision on liberating Taiwan is completely reasonable and timely. The people of the whole country will surely resolutely support the government's decision and do a good job in their respective posts.

    Luo Longji said that the victory of the Geneva Conference and the decision to liberate Taiwan made him deeply excited. He then analyzed the various weaknesses, lack of popular support, and unpopularity of the American aggressors, and said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, relying on the close unity of the people of the whole country, we firmly believe that we will be able to defeat the American aggressors' conspiracy to be hostile to the Chinese people and undermine peace, and victoriously liberate Taiwan.

    After discussion, the meeting unanimously adopted the resolution on approving the diplomatic report of Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai (full text to be published separately).

    The meeting then unanimously adopted the resolution on convening the first session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China (full text to be published separately), and adopted various appointment and removal proposals.

    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议在十一日下午扩大举行。中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来在会上作了外交报告（全文另发）。会议接着就外交报告进行了讨论，发言的有张治中、章伯钧、李济深、黄炎培、郭沫若、陈其尤、周建人、许德珩、罗隆基。他们在发言中，一致赞同和拥护周恩来总理兼外长的外交报告，认为报告中所提出的我国所一贯奉行的和平外交政策与解放台湾的任务，是完全正确的，全国人民应团结一致地为此而共同努力。
    张治中在发言中指出，旧中国的外交史是一部耻辱、惨痛的外交史。这次以周恩来总理为首的我国代表团在日内瓦会议上所取得的外交上的巨大成就，已经把过去受人欺凌的情况完全改变了。新中国的大国地位和作用，已为世人所公认。因此，全国人民的心情是无比欢欣的。关于解放台湾问题，张治中说，这完全是我国的内政问题。以蒋介石为首的卖国的反动集团勾结美国侵略者窃踞台湾，是中国人民所不能容忍的。为此，全国人民必须加强各方面的工作，为解放台湾、保卫国家的主权和领土的完整而斗争。
    章伯钧说，继续贯彻和平外交政策与解放台湾，是中国人民所要坚决完成的光荣任务。过去，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，取得了革命斗争的胜利和国家建设的巨大成就。今后，只要全国人民万众一心，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，进一步地加强团结，提高警惕，是完全有信心、有力量解放台湾，保卫亚洲及世界和平的。
    李济深说，在日内瓦会议上所取得的各项成就是和平战胜战争的巨大胜利，也是我国人民继推翻蒋介石的罪恶统治、赶走外国侵略势力和取得抗美援朝胜利之后的又一伟大胜利。我国政府主张的和平共处的五项原则，已深入人心。我们将继续根据上述五项原则，巩固和发展我国与世界各国的和平合作关系，努力与有关国家共同保证彻底实现日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的各项协议。李济深接着说，现在，蒋介石卖国集团还勾结美国侵略者盘踞着我国神圣的领土台湾，不断骚扰我国沿海地区，这是解放了的中国人民所不能忍受的。为了保障我国主权和领土的完整，必须坚决解放台湾。
    黄炎培说，这次日内瓦会议的胜利结束，已使和平力量占了优势，侵略势力日益孤立。不同社会制度的各国和平共处这一原则，已成为全世界人民的共同要求。日内瓦会议后，我国人民将坚决与有关各国为彻底实现日内瓦会议所达成的各项协议而共同努力。我们要坚决反对美国侵略者策动组织对立的军事集团的阴谋；同时，为了保障我国的主权和领土的完整，必须坚决解放台湾。这是一个尖锐的斗争，全国人民应提高警惕、加强团结，作好各项工作，以争取解放战争的最后胜利。
    郭沫若说，日内瓦会议克服了美国方面的种种阻挠，终于取得了很大成就。通过这次会议，我国的国际地位已愈益提高，全世界爱好和平的人民对我国的期待更为殷切，这是光荣的事，同时，也加重了我国在国际事务中的责任。我们应戒骄戒躁，加强国内、国际的团结，努力建设，增强我国的力量，以便为保卫世界和平作更多的贡献。为了最后完成全国的解放事业，解放台湾是我国人民责无旁贷的历史任务。我们深信，在全国人民的积极支持之下，攻无不克，战无不胜的中国人民解放军一定能够胜利完成这一光荣的任务。
    陈其尤说，日内瓦会议是已经胜利结束了，但是美国侵略者还不甘心失败，它还继续勾结蒋介石卖国贼侵占着我国领土台湾，并策动组织各种对立的军事集团，制造国际紧张局势。为此，全世界人民必须提高警惕，坚决反对美国破坏和平的阴谋活动。中国人民应继续团结在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，坚决解放台湾，以实现解放事业的最后胜利和保卫亚洲及世界的和平。
    周建人在发言中，对日内瓦会议的成就与我国代表团的努力致贺，接着说，解放台湾是全国人民的共同意志。美国侵略者如决心干涉我国内政，将自食恶果。为了完成解放台湾这一光荣任务，全国人民应更紧密地团结起来，作好各项工作。
    许德珩在发言中，首先祝贺日内瓦会议的胜利。在谈到解放台湾的问题时，他说，这是有待我国人民去完成的历史任务。政府关于解放台湾的决策，是完全合理的、适时的。全国人民必将坚决拥护政府这一决策，在本岗位上作好工作。
    罗隆基说，日内瓦会议的胜利和解放台湾的决策，使自己深为兴奋。他接着在分析了美国侵略者的种种弱点、失道寡助和不得人心之后说，我们在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，依靠全国人民的紧密团结，深信一定能够击败美国侵略者敌视中国人民、破坏和平的阴谋，胜利地解放台湾。
    会议经过讨论后，一致通过了关于批准政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来的外交报告的决议（全文另发）。
