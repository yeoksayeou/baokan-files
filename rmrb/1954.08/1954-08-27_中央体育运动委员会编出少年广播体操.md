    Central Sports Commission Compiles Juvenile Radio Calisthenics
    The Central Sports Commission has compiled a set of juvenile radio calisthenics and decided to promote it in primary schools nationwide starting from the fall semester of 1954. The Central People's Broadcasting Station has already begun teaching it on the radio since August 22nd, and local people's broadcasting stations across the country will also launch this program successively.

  　In recent years, sports activities for children and adolescents nationwide, especially primary school students, have greatly developed, and their health levels have gradually improved. However, our country still lacks a complete set of juvenile calisthenics suitable for the physical development of children and adolescents that can be practiced regularly. Many primary schools use adult radio calisthenics as a substitute. In response to this situation, in March of this year, the Central Sports Commission, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau of the Government Administration Council's Culture and Education Committee, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and some physical education teachers from Beijing primary schools, with the help of Soviet expert Comrade Kailoshev, jointly compiled the juvenile radio calisthenics. This set of radio calisthenics is compiled according to the physiological characteristics of children aged nine to twelve, including movements for all major parts of the body, with appropriate amounts of exercise, and has the function of promoting the normal physical development of children.
    The Chinese Musicians Association has preliminarily composed music for this set of radio calisthenics. The People's Sports Publishing House will also publish an illustrated guide to juvenile radio calisthenics in the near future. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央体育运动委员会编出少年广播体操
    中央人民政府体育运动委员会已经编出一套少年广播体操，并决定自一九五四年度上学期起在全国各小学推行。中央人民广播电台已从八月二十二日开始在广播中教授，全国各地人民广播电台也将陆续举办这个节目。
  　几年来，全国少年儿童特别是小学学生的体育活动有了很大开展，健康水平得到逐渐改善。但是，我国还没有一套完善的适合于少年儿童身体发展而可以经常进行锻炼的少年体操，很多小学校都采用成人广播体操代替。根据这一情况，今年三月间中央人民政府体育运动委员会、教育部、卫生部、政务院文化教育委员会广播事业局、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和一部分北京市小学体育教师，在苏联专家凯洛舍夫同志的帮助下，共同编制了少年广播体操。这套广播体操是根据九至十二岁少年儿童的生理特征编制的，包括全身各主要部分的动作，有适当的运动量，具备着促进少年儿童身体正常发育的功能。
    中国音乐家协会已初步为这套广播体操编制乐曲。人民体育出版社也将在最近期间出版少年广播体操图解。（新华社）
