The Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!," the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, Issues 29 and 30 of 1954, have been published successively.

These two issues devoted considerable space to editorials, articles, and activities related to the celebration of the 10th anniversary of Poland's National Rebirth Day. Issue 29 published an editorial entitled "The Great Vitality of the People's Democratic System," which discussed the great achievements made by the Polish people over the past decade and the superiority of the people's democratic system. This issue also contained an article entitled "Ten Years of People's Poland" by Jozwiak-Witold, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. In addition to reporting on the Polish people's celebration of National Rebirth Day, Issue 30 also contained reports and speeches made by Bolesław Bierut, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and Nikolai Bulganin, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, at the celebration of the 10th anniversary of National Rebirth Day held in Warsaw, the capital of Poland.

Issue 30 published an editorial entitled "The Will of the Peoples of All Countries to Safeguard and Consolidate Peace Is Invincible." The editorial pointed out: Peace-loving people all over the world have learned with joy that the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has achieved its main objective and that the main task of restoring peace in Indochina has been successfully completed. This is another major victory for the forces of peace and a major step towards easing international tensions. At the same time, the Geneva agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia mark a major victory for the national liberation struggles of the people of Indochina to win national honor, independence, and freedom, and to oppose the French colonialists' attempts to maintain the colonial system by force. The success of the conference once again proves that in the current international situation, there are no disputes or major issues that cannot be resolved through peaceful negotiations. One of the important reasons for the success of the conference is that the People's Republic of China participated in the Geneva Conference together with other major powers. Today, without the participation of the true representatives of the peoples of Asia, without the participation of the People's Republic of China, no major issues related to the establishment of international peace can be resolved. The editorial emphasized that the enemies of peace have suffered a defeat in Geneva, but they have not abandoned their plans to endanger the vital interests of the peoples of all countries. The forces of peace and all honest people must be more vigilant, unite more closely to oppose the conspiracies of the US imperialists, and take more active action to strive for the rapid resolution of international issues that have not yet been resolved.

Issue 30 also contains an important article, "The Situation in Greece and the Struggle of the Greek People" by Joe Gusias, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party. The article emphasizes that the characteristic of the Greek situation in recent months is that anti-American and anti-government sentiments have gradually turned into active actions to fight for the vital interests of the masses. This transformation is taking place in all strata of residents. Therefore, the conditions for establishing a patriotic united front are becoming more and more mature. The progressive forces of the country are working hard to strengthen the unity of workers, staff, farmers, handicraftsmen, and working people of all strata, and are tirelessly working to turn the idea of ​​unity and cooperation among patriots into action. In the process of organizing and leading our people in economic and political struggles, the Greek Communist Party will further develop its organization so as to become the core of the new patriotic struggle of the Greek people.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第二十九、三十两期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年中文版第二十九、三十两期已先后出版。
    这两期以大量篇幅刊载了有关庆祝波兰国家复兴节十周年的社论、文章和活动。第二十九期发表了题为“人民民主制度的伟大生命力”的社论，论述波兰人民十年来所取得的巨大成就和人民民主制度的优越性。这一期还刊载了波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员约兹维亚克—韦托德的题为“人民波兰十周年”的文章。第三十期除报道了波兰人民欢庆国家复兴节的情况外，还刊载了波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记贝鲁特和苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、苏联部长会议第一副主席布尔加宁在波兰首都华沙举行的国家复兴节十周年庆祝大会上所作的报告和演说。
    第三十期以“各国人民维护并巩固和平的意志是不可战胜的”为题发表社论。社论指出：全世界爱好和平的人士欢欣鼓舞地获悉日内瓦外长会议已经达到了它的主要目的，恢复印度支那和平的主要任务已经胜利地完成了。这是和平力量的又一次重大的胜利，是朝着缓和国际紧张局势的方向迈进了一大步。同时，日内瓦会议关于在越南、老挝、柬埔寨停止敌对行动的协议，标志着印度支那各国人民争取民族荣誉、独立和自由，反对法国殖民者企图用武力保持殖民制度的民族解放斗争的重大胜利。会议的成就再一次证明，在目前的国际局势中没有任何争端和重大问题是不可以通过和平协商方式来解决。会议获得成功的重要原因之一是中华人民共和国同其他大国一起参加了日内瓦会议。在今天，如果没有亚洲各国人民的真正代表参加，没有中华人民共和国参加，任何有关建立国际和平的重大问题都是不能解决的。社论强调说：和平事业的敌人在日内瓦遭到了失败，但它们还没有放弃它们危及各国人民切身利益的计划。爱好和平的力量和一切正直的人们必须加倍警惕，更加团结起来反对美帝国主义者的阴谋，必须更加积极地行动起来，争取迅速解决仍未解决的国际问题。
      第三十期刊载的重要文章还有希腊共产党中央委员会书记乔·古齐亚斯的“希腊的局势和希腊人民的斗争”。文章强调指出：最近几个月来希腊局势的特点是反美和反政府的情绪已日渐转变为争取群众切身利益的积极行动。这种转变发生在所有的居民阶层中。因此，建立一个爱国联合阵线的条件一天比一天成熟了。全国进步力量正在努力加强工人、职员、农民、手工业者以及各阶层劳动人民的团结，并且正在不倦地努力使爱国人士团结合作的思想变为行动。希腊共产党在组织和领导我国人民进行经济和政治斗争的过程中，将进一步发展自己的组织，以便成为希腊人民的新的爱国斗争的核心。
