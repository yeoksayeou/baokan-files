As I bid farewell to Helsinki, I sincerely thank the Finnish government and Finnish friends for their thoughtful hospitality and the Finnish people for their warm welcome.

During my short seven-day stay in Finland, I saw Finland's abundant forests, beautiful lakes, and many new buildings in the cities; I visited Finland's large-scale paper mills, shipyards, and metal products factories, which convinced me that there are broad prospects for trade between China and Finland. I came into contact with the hardworking Finnish people and felt their sincere friendship towards the Chinese people. Although the visit was short, it left me with an indelible impression. I am convinced that the friendship between the Chinese and Finnish people is profound.

During my visit, I held discussions with the Finnish government authorities on the issue of expanding Sino-Finnish trade. Both sides agreed to negotiate a supplementary trade agreement in addition to the 1954 Sino-Finnish trade agreement and to begin discussions on specific issues as soon as possible.

On this occasion of parting, I wish the friendship between the governments and peoples of China and Finland will grow day by day!

    我在芬兰停留了短短的七天，我看到了芬兰丰饶的森林，美丽的湖泊，以及城市中不少新兴的建筑；我参观了芬兰规模宏大的造纸厂、造船厂以及金属制品厂，使我相信中芬两国的贸易是有广阔的前途的。我接触了勤劳的芬兰人民，从他们那里体会到他们对中国人民诚挚的友谊。虽然访问时间很短促，但已留给我一个不可磨灭的印象。我深信，中芬两国人民的友谊是深厚的。

    值此临别之际，我愿祝中芬两国政府和人民的友谊日益增进！
