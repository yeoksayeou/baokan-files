    More than 9,100 newly admitted university students in the Southwest are actively preparing for enrollment this year. Among them, more than 1,500 cadres and demobilized soldiers have mostly left their original posts and are heading to various schools to enroll. More than 160 ethnic minority students admitted to schools such as Renmin University of China, Beijing Institute of Geology, and Beijing Medical College have also begun their journeys. Many students admitted to various universities outside the region have gathered in Chongqing and Chengdu, preparing to go to their respective schools.
    Currently, Northeast Normal University, Dalian Institute of Technology, Nankai University, and other schools have sent people to the Southwest to welcome new students. Relevant government departments have established work stations in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places to arrange accommodation and transportation for the new students.

Xinhua News Agency:

    Major universities, middle and high schools in Shenyang have hung eye-catching banners with large characters reading "Welcome New Students" at their school gates, and preparations for welcoming new students are actively underway. Dormitories prepared for new students have been tidied up and improved. The welcoming committees established by each school have also begun their work. Schools are now planning to set up new student reception stations at the railway station. More than 400 students from China Medical University are participating in the new student reception work. Shenyang Normal College has sent more than 300 congratulatory letters to newly admitted students, welcoming them to register at the school as soon as possible. This year, many schools in Shenyang have expanded their enrollment quotas. All schools guarantee that students will have a comfortable learning environment. China Medical University is currently expanding a library, which will be renovated into three student reading rooms and one faculty reading room. Northeast Pharmaceutical College has recently moved into a new school building. The Northeast Conservatory of Music has built 102 piano practice rooms and performance classrooms, and the large performance classroom covers an area of 600 square meters, which will allow students to get sufficient performance practice. This year, the state has also increased the construction funds allocated to ordinary middle schools in Shenyang. The city will add five middle schools, four of which will be built entirely according to new designs, with campuses, teaching buildings, laboratories, dormitories, and gymnasiums.
