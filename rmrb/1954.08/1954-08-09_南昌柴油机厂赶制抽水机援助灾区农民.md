    Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory Rushes to Produce Water Pumps to Aid Farmers in Disaster Areas

    The first batch of water pumps produced by the workers of the state-owned Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory were shipped to flood-stricken areas on July 26th to play a role in drainage. The second batch of water pumps manufactured by the factory is currently being packed for shipment. These water pumps are complete sets of machinery and can be used immediately upon arrival. The factory workers have also manufactured additional easily consumable parts for these water pumps for timely replacement.

    In order to assist the farmers, the workers of the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory engaged in selfless labor during the production of these water pumps. Jiang Jiatong, the model section chief of the factory, worked for more than ten hours while ill and refused to rest despite repeated persuasion from the leadership. Some section chiefs persisted in working for more than twenty hours straight. On a rainy Sunday, more than ten Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and young workers spontaneously organized a shock team to carry out voluntary labor. The factory's Communist Youth League organization also organized youth shock teams at the request of young workers, serving as a shock force in production. Leaders at all levels in the factory, tool custodians, recorders, statisticians, and medical personnel all went deep into the workshops to coordinate production. The local state-owned Jiangxi Textile Factory, the local state-owned Jiangxi Machinery Factory, and the state-owned Nanchang Power Plant also sent more than twenty outstanding workers to provide support. In order to strive to complete the task ahead of schedule, many workers actively improved equipment and promoted advanced Soviet experience. Labor model Gong Lagen began researching the modification of a planer into a milling machine in May, but after more than ten experiments, he had not been successful. However, when he heard that water pumps were needed urgently to support the people in flood-stricken areas in overcoming the flood, his enthusiasm grew, and he resolved to continue his research. With the enthusiastic support of the workshop leadership and the help of veteran workers and engineers, he finally succeeded in the experiment on July 20th, increasing work efficiency threefold. With the active efforts of all employees, the two batches of water pumps were completed two days ahead of the time required by the higher authorities. After testing, the quality met the standards.

    南昌柴油机厂赶制抽水机援助灾区农民
    国营南昌柴油机厂职工赶制出来的第一批抽水机，已在七月二十六日运往遭受水灾的地区发挥排水的作用。这个工厂制造出来的第二批抽水机正在装箱待运。这些抽水机都是成套的机械，运到以后立刻就能应用。这个工厂职工还为这些抽水机多制了一部分容易损耗的机件，以便随时调换。
    南昌柴油机厂职工为了援助农民，在生产这些抽水机中进行了忘我的劳动。这个工厂的模范工段长姜家通带病工作了十多小时，经领导方面再三劝告也不肯休息。有的工段长一直坚持工作二十多个小时。在一个下着大雨的星期天，有十多个共产党员、青年团员和青年工人自动地组织了一个突击队进行义务劳动。这个工厂青年团组织还根据青年工人的要求组织了青年突击队，做为生产中的突击力量。厂里各级领导干部、工具保管员、记录员、统计员和医务人员等都深入车间配合生产。地方国营江西纺织厂、地方国营江西机械厂和国营南昌电厂也派了二十多个优秀的工人前来支援。为了争取提前完成任务，许多工人积极地改进设备和推广苏联先进经验。劳动模范龚腊根在五月份就开始研究改龙门刨床为铣床，但经过十多次试验，一直没有成功。但当他听到要赶制抽水机来支援受水灾地区人民战胜洪水时，劲头又大了起来，下决心继续研究。在车间领导方面的热情支持和老工人、工程师们的帮助下，终于在七月二十日试验成功，工作效率提高三倍。在全体职工积极努力下，两批抽水机已比上级要求的时间提前两天赶制完毕。经过试验，质量合乎标准。　（新华社）
