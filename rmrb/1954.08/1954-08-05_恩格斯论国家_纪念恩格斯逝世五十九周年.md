Engels on the State
    —Commemorating the Fifty-Ninth Anniversary of Engels' Death
    Wang Ruoshui

    I
    The question of the state is the fundamental question of all politics. For a long period in the past, the question of the state was thrown into confusion by bourgeois scholars. Only Marx and Engels made a scientific analysis of the origin and essence of the state for the first time, refuted the fallacies and deceptions of the bourgeoisie, and established the historical materialist theory of the state.
    The work of historical analysis of the state was mainly undertaken by Engels after Marx's death. In his book "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State," Engels, based on vast historical materials, profoundly analyzed the causes and conditions for the emergence of the state, convincingly proving the following principles: the state is not something that has existed since ancient times; in primitive society, people simply did not know what the "state" was; the state only emerged after society was divided into antagonistic classes. The state is an instrument for the ruling class to oppress the ruled class. The class that occupies the dominant position economically becomes the class that occupies the dominant position politically with the help of the state. The state is a means of mitigating class conflict, but its very existence proves the irreconcilability of class contradictions. The characteristics that distinguish the state from the old clan organization are, first, that it divides the people under its rule according to territorial standards, and second, that it establishes a special social power—armed forces and prisons, etc. To support this social power, taxes and public debt are needed. This power is held by officials, forming an organ that is above society. The state will not exist forever. In the future, with the elimination of classes, the state as an instrument of class struggle will also lose its need. At that time, the entire state machine will be placed in the museum of antiquities, alongside the spinning wheel and the bronze axe.
    Marxism believes that the state is a superstructure of society at a certain historical stage. It is determined by the base—the socio-economic system—changes with the changes of the base, and serves the base. The state does not merely passively reflect the base, but also has a reaction to the base. Engels pointed out that the reaction of state power on economic development can take three forms: it can follow the same direction as economic development, accelerating economic development; it can also hinder economic development, in which case state power will perish; finally, it may cut off a certain direction of economic development and prescribe another direction, which in the end will be reduced to one of the first two situations. (Letter to Schmidt, October 27, 1890)
    In this way, Marxism clarifies the dual nature of the state—historicity and class character—and clarifies the position and role of the state in the entire society. This point of view was later developed and elaborated in the writings of Lenin and Stalin, thus forming a complete system of Marxist-Leninist theory of the state.

    II
    There are different historical types of states: slave states, feudal states, bourgeois states—all these states are states of exploiters, instruments of oppression of the majority by the minority; in addition, there is a new type of state, which Engels once called "not a state in the original sense," that is, the proletarian state, a socialist type of state.
    Bourgeois scholars still claim that the bourgeois state is a "national" and "free and equal" state. In fact, as early as the "Communist Manifesto" in 1848, Marx and Engels revealed the class essence of the bourgeois state in simple and clear terms. They said that the government of a capitalist country is "but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie." Of course, bourgeois democratic republics, bourgeois parliaments, and universal suffrage once had great progressive significance in history. It broke the decadent feudal forces, developed the productive forces of large industry, and indirectly promoted the awakening of the proletariat and promoted class struggle. However, the bourgeois state, whether it takes the form of a constitutional monarchy or a democratic republic, is essentially a bourgeois dictatorship. The so-called democracy of the bourgeoisie is only a democracy enjoyed by a minority of people, a formal and false democracy. Engels said: "In a democratic republic, wealth exercises its power indirectly, but therefore all the more surely." First, by "direct bribery of officials," like the United States; second, by "alliance of government and stock exchange," like the United States and France. As for universal suffrage, although it marks the maturity of the working class, "in the present state, universal suffrage cannot and never will give more than this" (ibid.). "The state is nothing but a machine for the oppression of one class by another, and indeed in the democratic republic no less than in the monarchy." (Introduction to "The Civil War in France")
    Marx and Engels exposed the hypocrisy of its democracy long ago regarding the then newly emerging bourgeois state of the United States. Engels said that there is no place in the world like the United States where political speculators of the two major parties (Republican and Democratic) "alternately occupy the power, using this power in the dirtiest way for the most despicable purposes. - And the entire nation is powerless to rise up against this coalition of two major politicians, who ostensibly serve the nation, but in reality exploit and rule them." (Introduction to "The Civil War in France") "For a long time, the United States has been proving to the world that the bourgeois republic is a republic of capitalist merchants, in which politics, like everything else, is a business transaction" (Letter to Sorge, December 31, 1892).
    These words that Engels said sixty years ago do not need to be changed by even one word for today's United States. From 1857 to the present, over nearly a hundred years, the Democratic and Republican parties have alternately manipulated the U.S. government. These two parties have in fact long been indistinguishable. They are both loyal followers of the American financial oligarchy. Whether in Congress, in the government, or in the courts, those who hold real power are bank directors, managers of large companies, factory shareholders, and lawyers. These people are either capitalists or agents of capitalists, and they directly use state power to increase profits for their enterprises. As everyone knows, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles is a director of an arms company and a shareholder of the "United Fruit Company," which manipulates the lifeline of the national economy of Guatemala. When Dulles speaks of the need to oppose the democratic forces of Guatemala for the sake of "American" interests, it is not necessary to specify whose interests he is actually referring to. The business that Dulles does in his Wall Street "Sullivan & Cromwell Law Firm" and the deals he plays in the State Department are merely different in form.
    Although the bourgeois constitution proclaims to grant the people freedom and equal rights, it is always an unfulfilled empty promise on paper. Just as Marx said when discussing the French constitution, "Freedom is prescribed in general terms, but canceled in the annotations." (The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte) Regarding the U.S. Constitution, Engels once wrote sarcastically:
   "The special bourgeois nature of these rights of man can be proved by the fact that the American Constitution, which first recognized human rights, simultaneously confirmed the slavery of black people in the United States" (Anti-Dühring). As everyone knows, racial discrimination in the United States is still a serious social problem.
    In his article "The English Constitution," written in 1844, Engels sharply criticized the bourgeois constitutionalism and the principle of checks and balances of power. He pointed out that in England, it is actually property ownership that rules: the aristocracy dominates the election of representatives in rural areas and small cities; merchants and factory owners determine the representatives of large cities and some small cities; and the two jointly expand their power through bribery. In addition, in the election law, the working class, which constitutes the majority of the population, is excluded due to restrictions on property qualifications and residency conditions. The proposition of mutual checks and balances between various powers is laughably unreasonable and impossible to implement. Engels wrote: "The entire English constitution and the entire constitutionalist public opinion are nothing but a huge lie."
    Capitalism has now developed to its final stage—the stage of imperialism. In the economy, monopoly capital has replaced free competition; correspondingly, political reaction has replaced the initial democracy. The instruments of bourgeois state power—the army, police, gendarmes, intelligence agencies, courts, prisons—have become huge and bloated, and are intensifying the sucking of the blood and sweat of the working people. Especially in the United States, the ruling bourgeoisie has abandoned the remaining bit of democracy and freedom and is increasingly moving towards the path of open terror dictatorship of fascism.
    The development history of the bourgeois state proves the law of dialectical materialism: the progressive capitalist political system that originally promoted social and economic development has now become a shackle hindering the development of productive forces and a tool for maintaining the decadent forces in society. Thus, it is doomed to its own demise.

    III
    In the "Communist Manifesto," Marx and Engels put forward the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They believed that the first step in the proletarian revolution is to overthrow the bourgeoisie by force, establish its own rule, and then gradually seize all the capital of the bourgeoisie, concentrate all the instruments of production in the hands of the state, and concentrate them in the hands of the proletariat organized as the ruling class.
    The ultimate goal of the proletariat is to eliminate classes and also eliminate the state as an instrument of class struggle. However, Marxism is different from anarchism. Anarchists advocate the complete elimination of the state within twenty-four hours and deny the dictatorship of the proletariat, while Marxists firmly believe that after overthrowing the bourgeois regime, the proletariat should temporarily preserve the state, consolidate its rule, and gradually create conditions for the state to naturally disappear.
    On this issue, Marx and Engels once engaged in a debate with the Proudhonists in 1873. Marx and Engels refuted the anarchists' political position, emphasizing that in order to break the resistance of the bourgeoisie, the working class should establish its own revolutionary dictatorship to replace the bourgeois dictatorship, and should not abolish the state, but give the state a "revolutionary temporary form." Engels said in his article "On Authority": Revolution is precisely the most authoritative thing in the world. If the victorious party does not want the struggle to be fruitless, it must use weapons to intimidate the reactionaries in order to maintain its rule.
    However, the question of the state form of the proletariat had not and could not be resolved when the "Communist Manifesto" was published.
    The French Revolution of 1848, especially the heroic struggle of the "Paris Commune" in 1871, provided new experience for the world working class. This experience enabled Marx and Engels to further specify the method for the proletariat to solve the state problem. Marx pointed out in his "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" in 1852, "The Civil War in France" in 1871, and in the preface to the 1872 German edition of the "Communist Manifesto," co-signed with Engels, that the working class cannot simply seize the ready-made state machine, but must destroy it.
    In "The Civil War in France," Marx pointed out the characteristics of the Paris Commune, this new type of "a definite form of republic system": abolishing the standing army and police as old state tools, and replacing them with the armed forces of the people; electing representatives by universal suffrage (mostly workers), who can be replaced at any time; abolishing the privileges enjoyed by old-style state officials, and making all public officials receive salaries equal to workers' wages; the commune should not be a parliamentary-style institution with only legislative power, but a working group that combines legislative and administrative work, etc. Marx emphasized: "The true secret of the Commune was this. It was essentially a working class government, the produce of the struggle of the producing against the appropriating class, the political form at last discovered under which to work out the economic emancipation of labor."
    In this way, Marx discovered the state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat to replace the bourgeois state.
    However, this principle, once indicated by Marx, was not further developed in his later works and was finally forgotten. In his critique of the "Erfurt Program" written in 1891, Engels still proposed that the democratic republic is a "specific form of the dictatorship of the proletariat." Of course, what Engels meant here was not the bourgeois parliamentary republic, but a parliamentary republic with new class content; as for the former, Engels said, "We hate it as we hate the monarchy."
    Engels' formula has been a guideline followed by Marxists in various countries for a long period of time, until Lenin put forward a new formula.

    IV
    The question of the state form of the proletariat was fully resolved in the Russian Revolution and in Lenin's works.
    In the Russian Revolution of 1905, especially in the February Revolution of 1917, the revolutionary laboring masses created a new political form—the Soviet. Lenin studied the experience of the two Russian revolutions and concluded that the best political form of the dictatorship of the proletariat is not a parliamentary democratic republic, but a Soviet republic. This form is suitable for the task of liberating the laboring masses, and it is the development and completion of the Paris Commune. In this way, Lenin creatively promoted Marxism and enriched the theory with new experience.
    Since the emergence of the Soviet regime in 1917, the era of bourgeois republics has ended, and the era of proletarian revolution and the era of socialist democracy have begun.
    The dictatorship of the proletariat is the highest form of democracy in class society. It gives democracy to the laborers who constitute the majority of the population (mainly workers and peasants who implement alliances), and only implements dictatorship over a very small number of exploiters, thereby ensuring the transition to a classless society. In the Soviet Union, the state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the Soviet. The characteristics of the Soviet regime are: it is the most mass-based and most democratic state organization in class society, and it is also the most international organization. It facilitates the proletariat to realize its leadership, and it combines legislative power and administrative power.
    After the victory of the October Revolution, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union smashed the old bourgeois state machine and established the dictatorship of the proletariat. From the October Revolution to the elimination of the exploiting classes, the socialist state performed two basic functions: first, suppressing the overthrown exploiting classes at home; second, defending the country and preventing foreign aggression. In addition, there is a third function, which is the organizational work and cultural and educational work of the state organs. From the elimination of the exploiting classes to the complete victory of the socialist economy and the passage of the new constitution, the aforementioned first function disappeared, replaced by the function of preventing the embezzlement of people's wealth and protecting socialist public property. The second function is still preserved, and the third function has been greatly developed and has become the basic task of the state at home.
    In this way, the Soviet state, as the socialist superstructure, relied on objective economic laws to eliminate the old economic base and created a new socialist economic base, achieving the complete victory of the socialist revolution: there is no system of exploitation, no antagonistic classes, and the socialist economy has become the sole economic system of the entire society.
    Then, real life raised the theoretical question: Under these conditions, is it still necessary to preserve the state?
    In the 1870s, Engels published a famous principle on this issue in "Anti-Dühring." Engels believed that when the opposition of classes disappears and when the socialist revolution is victorious, the state will become superfluous and die out on its own. Engels' formula is correct, but he only referred to the victory of socialism in all countries or most countries. He did not answer the specific question of whether the state should still be preserved if socialism is only victorious in one country and that country is still surrounded by capitalism.
    In 1939, Stalin gave an affirmative answer to this question in his summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the Eighteenth Party Congress. Stalin pointed out that if a victorious socialist country does not want to be defeated by the encirclement of capitalism, it should not weaken its own state, but should strengthen it. Stalin further pointed out that as long as the capitalist encirclement has not been eliminated, the state will still need to be preserved even in the communist era.

    V
    The question of the state is also one of the fundamental questions of the Chinese revolution. This question had not been resolved in China for a long time. From the Opium War in 1840 to 1917, many advanced people in China had been looking for solutions to this problem from Western countries. They accepted the influence of bourgeois democracy and believed that China should establish a bourgeois democratic republic. But China was a country oppressed by imperialism, and the national bourgeoisie was very weak, so all revolutions aimed at establishing a bourgeois dictatorship republic failed. People saw no way out. At this time, the October Revolution broke out, and the first socialist country in the world—Soviet Russia—appeared. Then Marxism-Leninism was introduced to China, triggering the May Fourth Movement. From then on, the period of the New Democratic Revolution began. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, after decades of heroic struggle, finally achieved a great victory, overthrew the old state of feudal comprador-fascist dictatorship, and established a new state of people's democratic dictatorship.
    The history of the founding of the People's Republic of China is the history of the bankruptcy of the bourgeois republic plan, and at the same time, it is the history of the victory of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state and revolution. The facts are just as Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Bourgeois democracy gives way to people's democracy led by the working class, and the bourgeois republic gives way to the people's republic."
    Comrade Mao Zedong, according to the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state, combined with China's historical conditions and revolutionary experience, in his many works, especially in "On New Democracy," "On Coalition Government," "On People's Democratic Dictatorship," and in the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China drafted under his leadership, solved the state problem of the Chinese revolution. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people smashed all the state machines of the Kuomintang reactionaries, established and strengthened the people's state machine, so as to suppress and transform the overthrown classes, defend national defense and protect the fruits of the revolution, and organize economic construction and cultural construction, leading the people to steadily transition to socialism.
    According to the provisions of the draft constitution, our country is a state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. All power belongs to the people, and the basic system of the state is the people's congress system of democratic centralism. The deputies to the people's congresses are elected by universal suffrage and can be replaced by voters at any time in accordance with the procedures prescribed by law; the National People's Congress unifies legislative power and administrative power. All state organs must maintain close ties with the masses at all times and strive to serve the people. All this shows that our state form is fundamentally different from the bourgeois republic, but belongs to the same type as the Paris Commune and the Soviet system. Our system is a truly democratic system, and the achievements of nearly five years have fully proved the superiority of this system.
    As early as a hundred years ago, Marx and Engels predicted that the reactionaries of Europe would encounter the words "Chinese Republic—Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" on the Great Wall of China ("Marx and Engels on China"). At that time, China was at the beginning of the old-style bourgeois democratic revolution, and the Chinese proletariat had not yet appeared on the historical stage, so Marx and Engels only predicted that a progressive bourgeois democratic republic would emerge in China. Now, we can tell them with comfort: we have not only lived up to but exceeded their expectations. Under the brilliant light of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state, we have established a people's democratic republic led by the proletariat and are striving to transition to a socialist society.

    恩格斯论国家
    ——纪念恩格斯逝世五十九周年
    王若水
    一
    国家问题是全部政治的根本问题。在过去很长时期内，国家问题被资产阶级的学者弄得混乱不堪，只有马克思和恩格斯才第一次对国家的起源和实质作了科学的分析，驳倒了资产阶级的谬论和欺骗，确立了历史唯物主义的国家学说。
    关于国家的历史分析这一工作，主要是在马克思逝世以后由恩格斯担负起来的。恩格斯在“家族、私有财产及国家的起源”一书中，根据浩繁的历史材料，深刻地分析了国家发生的原因和条件，令人信服地证明了下面的原理：国家不是自古就有的，在原始社会中，人们根本就不知道“国家”为何物；只在社会分裂为对立的阶级后，才产生了国家。国家是统治阶级压迫被统治阶级的工具。在经济上占统治地位的阶级，借助于国家，就成为在政治上也占统治地位的阶级。国家是缓和阶级冲突的手段，但它本身的存在，却正证明了阶级矛盾的不可调和。国家与旧的氏族组织不同的特征，第一在于它按地域标准来区分其管治下的人民，第二在于特殊社会权力的建立——武装队伍和监狱等等。为供养这种社会权力，就需要赋税和公债。这种权力被官吏掌握着，形成高居于社会之上的机关。国家是不会永远存在的，在将来，随着阶级的消灭，作为阶级斗争的工具的国家也将失去其需要，那时候，就将把全部国家机器放在古物博物馆里，而与纺车和青铜斧并列。
    马克思主义认为，国家是社会在一定历史阶段中的上层建筑，它是由基础——社会经济制度——所决定，随基础的变化而变化，并为基础服务的。国家不只是消极地反映基础，而且对基础有反作用。恩格斯曾指出国家权力对于经济发展的反作用可以有三种情形：它会和经济发展遵循同一方向，加速经济的发展；它也会阻碍经济的发展，这样，国家权力就会灭亡；最后，它可能把经济发展的一定的方向切断，而规定出另外的方向，这种情形最后又会还原成前面两种情形之一。（一八九○年十月二十七日给史密特的信）
    这样，马克思主义就阐明了国家的两重性质——历史性和阶级性，阐明了国家在整个社会中的地位和作用。这种观点以后在列宁和斯大林的著作中得到了发展和发挥，从而构成了马克思列宁主义关于国家学说的完整体系。二
    国家有不同的历史类型：奴隶制国家、封建国家、资产阶级国家——所有这些国家都是剥削者的国家，是少数人压迫多数人的工具；此外还有一种新型的国家，恩格斯曾经称之为“不是原来意义上的国家”，这就是无产阶级国家，社会主义类型国家。
    资产阶级学者直到现在还宣称资产阶级的国家是“全民”的、“自由平等”的国家，其实，早在一八四八年的“共产党宣言”中，马克思和恩格斯就以简单明了的词句揭露了资产阶级国家的阶级本质，他们说，资本主义国家的政府“不过是管理整个资产者阶级共同事务的委员会”而已。当然，资产阶级民主共和国，资产阶级的国会和普选制，在历史上曾经有过巨大的进步意义。它打破了腐朽的封建势力，发展了大工业的生产力，也间接促进了无产阶级的觉醒，推动了阶级斗争。然而，资产阶级的国家，不论它采取的形式是君主立宪制或民主共和制，实质上都是资产阶级专政。资产阶级的所谓民主，只是供少数人享受的民主，只是形式的、虚伪的民主。恩格斯说：“在民主共和国内，财富运用自己的权力，是间接的，但因此是更可靠的”。第一，是用“直接收买官吏”的方法，像美国；第二，是用“政府与交易所联盟”的方法，像美国和法国。至于普选制，虽然它标志着工人阶级的成熟，但“在现今国家中，普选制是不能而且始终不会给出更多的东西的”（同上书）。“国家无非是这一阶级镇压另一阶级的机器，即令在民主共和制下也丝毫不弱于在君主制下。”（“法兰西内战”引言）
    对于当时的美国这个新兴的资产阶级国家，马克思和恩格斯早就揭露了它的民主的虚伪性。恩格斯说，在世界上没有一个地方像美国那样，两大政党（共和党和民主党）的政治投机家“轮换地占据政权，用最肮脏的方法，为最卑鄙的目的来运用这一政权。——而全国国民，则无力起来反对这两大政客的联合，这些人表面上是给国民服务，实际上却是剥削他们与统治他们的。”（“法兰西内战”引言）“许久以来美国在向世界证明，资产阶级共和国就是一个资本主义商人共和国，在这一个国家内，政治像别的东西一样，也是一种买卖行为”（一八九二年十二月三十一日致索尔治函）。
    恩格斯在六十年前说的这些话，对今天的美国来说，是连一个字也不需要更改的。从一八五七年到现在，在将近一百年的长时期中，民主党和共和党交替操纵着美国政府，这两个政党实际上早已没有什么区别，它们同是美国金融寡头的忠顺走卒。不论在国会中，在政府中，在法院中，把持着实权的都是银行董事，大公司的经理，工厂股东和律师。这些人不是资本家就是资本家的代理人，他们直接运用国家权力来为他们的企业增加利润。大家知道，美国国务卿杜勒斯是军火公司的董事，又是操纵危地马拉的国民经济命脉的“美国联合果品公司”的股东，当杜勒斯开口闭口说为了“美国”的利益而必须反对危地马拉的民主势力的时候，他实质上是指谁的利益，那是不需要指明的。杜勒斯在他的华尔街“苏利文与克朗威尔律师事务所”里所做的生意和他在国务院所玩的勾当，不过是形式不同而已。
    尽管资产阶级宪法宣布赋予人民以自由平等的权利，但它却始终是不兑现的纸上空文。正像马克思在论到法国宪法时说，“在一般词句上规定着自由，而在注解中却取消了自由。”（拿破仑第三政变记）关于美国宪法，恩格斯曾经讽刺地写过：
  “这种人权的特殊资产阶级性质，可由下述事实来证明，即：最先承认人权的美国宪法，同时确认了存在于美国的黑人的奴隶制”（反杜林论）。大家知道，美国的种族歧视，至今是一个严重的社会问题。
    在一八四四年写的“英吉利宪法”一文中，恩格斯尖锐地批判了资产阶级的宪政和权力制衡原则。他指出，在英格兰，实际上是财产占有在统治着：贵族支配了乡村和小城市的代议士的选举；商人和厂主决定了大城市和一部分小城市的代表；而两者又共同通过贿赂扩大它们的势力。此外，在选举法中，由于财产资格和居住条件的限制，占人口大多数的工人阶级便被排斥。所谓各种权力间的相互制衡这个命题，是可笑地不合理，并且不可能实行。恩格斯写道：“全部英吉利宪法和全部立宪主义的舆论，都不外是一个巨大的谎言。”
    资本主义现在已经发展到它的最后阶段——帝国主义阶段，在经济上，独占资本代替了自由竞争；与此相适应，政治上的反动也代替了初期的民主。资产阶级国家权力的工具——军队、警察、宪兵、侦察机关、法庭、监狱，已经变得庞大臃肿不堪，并加紧吮吸劳动人民的血汗。特别是在美国，统治的资产阶级已经把剩余的一点民主和自由毁弃无余，日益走上了法西斯主义的公开恐怖专政的道路。
    资产阶级国家的发展历史证明了辩证唯物主义
  的规律：原先促进了社会经济发展的进步的资本主
  义的政治制度，现在成了阻碍生产力发展的桎梏，
  成了维持社会上腐朽势力的工具，这样，它就注定
  了自己的灭亡。三
    马克思和恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中，已经提出了无产阶级专政的思想。他们认为，无产阶级革命的第一步是用强力推翻资产阶级，建立自己的统治，然后一步一步地夺取资产阶级所有的全部资本，把一切生产工具集中在国家手中，集中在已组织成为统治阶级的无产阶级手中。
    无产阶级的最后目的是消灭阶级，同时也消灭作为阶级斗争的工具的国家。但是，马克思主义与无政府主义不同。无政府主义者主张在二十四小时内便完全消灭国家，否认无产阶级专政，而马克思主义者则坚决认为，在推翻资产阶级政权以后，无产阶级应当暂时保存国家，巩固自己的统治，并逐渐创造条件，使国家很自然地归于消灭。
    在这个问题上，马克思和恩格斯曾经在一八七三年与普鲁东派作过论战。马克思和恩格斯驳斥了无政府主义者的政治立场，强调指出为了打破资产阶级的反抗，工人阶级应当建立自己的革命专政来代替资产阶级专政，应当不废除国家，而赋予国家以“革命的暂时的形式”。恩格斯在“论威权”一文中这样说：革命正是世间最有威权的东西，获得胜利的政党如果不愿使斗争毫无结果，就必须用武器威吓反动派，来维持自己的统治。
    但是，关于无产阶级的国家形式的问题，在“共产党宣言”发表时还没有也不可能得到解决。
    法国一八四八年的革命，特别是一八七一年的
  “巴黎公社”的英勇斗争，向世界工人阶级提供了新的经验，这个经验使得马克思和恩格斯能够进一步具体指出无产阶级解决国家问题的方法。马克思在一八五二年的“拿破仑第三政变记”，一八七一年的“法兰西内战”中，以及在和恩格斯共同署名的一八七二年“共产党宣言”德文版序中，都指出了：工人阶级不能简单地掌握现成的国家机器，而是要把它摧毁。
    马克思在“法兰西内战”中指出了巴黎公社这种新型的“共和国制度一定形式”的特点；废除作为旧国家工具的常备军和警察，而代之以人民的武装力量；按普选制选举代表（大多数是工人），这些代表随时可以撤换；取消旧式国家官吏所享有的特权，使一切公务人员都领等于工人工资的薪水；公社应当不是国会式的那种只有立法权的机关，而是兼任立法和行政的工作团体，等等。马克思着重指出：“公社的真正秘密，就在于它实质上是工人阶级的政府，是生产者阶级反对占有者阶级之斗争的结果，是终究发现了的可以使劳动在经济上获得解放的政治形式。”
    这样，马克思就发现了代替资产阶级式的国家的无产阶级专政的国家形式。
    但是，这个马克思一度指示的原则在他以后的著作里没有被继续发挥，而终于被人遗忘了。恩格斯在一八九一年所写的对“爱尔福特纲领”的批评中，依然提出民主共和国是适用于“无产阶级专政的一种特有形式”。当然，恩格斯在这里所指的，并不是资产阶级的国会制共和国，而是具有新的阶级内容的国会制共和国；至于对前者，恩格斯说，
  “我们仇视它就像仇视君主制一样”。
    恩格斯的这个公式，曾经在一个长时期内成为世界各国马克思主义者奉行的准则，一直到列宁提出了新的公式为止。四
    无产阶级的国家形式问题，是在俄国革命中，在列宁的著作中，得到了圆满解决的。
      在一九○五年的俄国革命中，特别是在一九一 七年二月革命中，革命的劳动群众创造了新的政治形式——苏维埃。列宁研究了两次俄国革命的经验，得出结论说：无产阶级专政的最好政治形式，不是国会制的民主共和国，而是苏维埃共和国。这种形式正适合于解放劳动群众的任务，它是巴黎公社的发展和完成。这样，列宁就创造性地推进了马克思主义，用新的经验丰富了这个理论。
    从一九一七年苏维埃政权出现以后，资产阶级共和国的时代就结束了，从此开始了无产阶级革命的时代，社会主义民主的时代。
    无产阶级专政是阶级社会中最高形式的民主，它把民主给予占社会人口大多数的劳动者（主要是实行联盟的工人和农民），而只对极少数的剥削者实行专政，从而保证过渡到无阶级的社会。在苏联，无产阶级专政的国家形式就是苏维埃。苏维埃政权的特点在于：它是阶级社会中最具有群众性和最民主的国家组织，也是最有国际性的组织，它便于无产阶级实现自己的领导，它把立法权和行政权合并在一起。
    苏联共产党在十月革命胜利以后，粉碎了旧的资产阶级国家机器，建立了无产阶级专政。从十月革命起到消灭剥削阶级为止，社会主义国家执行了两个基本职能：第一，镇压国内已被推翻的剥削阶级；第二，保卫国家，防止外来侵犯。此外还有第三个职能，就是国家各机关的组织工作和文化教育工作。从消灭剥削阶级到社会主义经济完全胜利而通过新宪法时为止，前述的第一个职能消失了，代之以防范窃夺人民财富和保护社会主义公产的职能，第二个职能仍然保存着，第三个职能则得到了大大的发展，成为国家在国内的基本任务。
    这样，作为社会主义上层建筑的苏维埃国家，就依靠着客观经济法则而消灭了旧的经济基础，创立了新的社会主义经济基础，达到了社会主义革命的完全胜利：没有剥削制度，没有对抗的阶级，社会主义经济成为全社会的唯一经济体系。
    于是现实生活就提出了这样的理论问题：在这种条件下，是不是还需要保存国家呢？
    在十九世纪七十年代，恩格斯在“反杜林论”中曾对这个问题发表过一段有名的原理。恩格斯认为，当阶级的对立消灭以后，当社会主义革命胜利以后，国家就会成为多余的东西而自行消亡。恩格斯这一个公式是正确的，但他只是指社会主义在一切国家或大多数国家获得了胜利时说的。他并没有回答下面这个具体的问题，就是：如果社会主义仅仅在一个国家获得胜利，并且这个国家还处在资本主义的包围之中，国家是不是还应当保存？
    一九三九年斯大林在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告中，对这个问题给了肯定的答复。斯大林指出，胜利了的社会主义国家如果不愿被资本主义的包围所击溃，就不应当削弱自己的国家，而且应当加强它。斯大林并且进一步指出，只要资本主义包围没有消灭，即使在共产主义时期，国家也仍然需要保存。五
    国家问题也是中国革命的根本问题之一。这个问题，在中国曾长时期没有得到解决。从一八四○年鸦片战争起到一九一七年止，中国许多先进的人，是一直向西方国家寻找解决这个问题的方案的，他们接受了资产阶级民主主义的影响，相信中国应该建立一个资产阶级式的民主共和国。但是中国是一个受帝国主义压迫的国家，加上民族资产阶级又是非常软弱，因此历次以建立资产阶级专政共和国为目的的革命都失败了。人们看不到出路。这时爆发了十月革命，世界上出现了第一个社会主义国家——苏维埃俄罗斯。于是马克思列宁主义被介绍到了中国，掀起了五四运动。从此开始了新民主主义革命的时期。在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民经过了几十年的英勇斗争，终于取得了伟大的胜利，推翻了封建买办法西斯专政的旧国家，建立了人民民主专政的新国家。
    中华人民共和国成立的历史也就是资产阶级共和国方案破产的历史，同时也就是马克思列宁主义关于国家与革命的学说胜利的历史。事实正像毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中所说的那样：“资产阶级的民主主义让位给工人阶级领导的人民民主主义，资产阶级共和国让位给人民共和国。”
    毛泽东同志根据马克思列宁主义关于国家的学说，结合中国的历史条件和革命经验，在他的许多著作中，特别是在“新民主主义论”“论联合政府”“论人民民主专政”以及在他领导下起草的中华人民共和国宪法草案中，解决了中国革命的国家问题。在共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，中国人民粉碎了国民党反动派的全部国家机器，建立了和强化了人民的国家机器，借以镇压和改造被推翻的阶级，保卫国防和保护革命的成果，并组织经济建设和文化建设，领导人民稳步地向社会主义过渡。
    根据宪法草案的规定，我国是工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的国家，一切权力属于人民，国家的基本制度是实行民主集中制的人民代表大会。人民代表大会的代表由普选产生，并可随时由选民按照法律规定的程序来撤换；全国人民代表大会把立法权和行政权统一起来。一切国家机关必须经常同群众保持密切联系，努力为人民服务。这一切都说明了，我们的国家形式和资产阶级共和国根本不同，而是和巴黎公社、和苏维埃制度属于同一类型的。我们的制度是真正民主的制度，将近五年来的成就，已充分证明了这种制度的优越性。
    早在一百年前，马克思和恩格斯就预言过：欧洲的反动派，将来会在中国的万里长城碰到“中华共和国—自由、平等、博爱”这几个大字（“马克思恩格斯论中国”）。在那时，中国正处在旧式资产阶级民主革命的开端，而且中国无产阶级也没有登上历史舞台，所以马克思和恩格斯只是预言在中国将出现一个进步的资产阶级性质的民主共和国。现在，我们可以告慰他们说：我们不但没有辜负而且超过了他们的期望。在马克思列宁主义国家学说光辉的照耀下，我们已经建立了一个无产阶级领导的人民民主共和国，并正在为过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。
