Ambassador Rocha's Speech at the Reception

Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen:

Today we celebrate the seventh anniversary of the achievement of independence. On this day, every Pakistani is reviewing the achievements of their country in order to examine the work that has been completed and the work that remains to be done. Therefore, this day is a day of reflection for us, and also a very pleasant day.

Today, as we look back on the struggles we have made in the past seven years to consolidate and build (our country), we find ample encouragement in our achievements. But our achievements are indeed incomplete, and much remains to be done. Our country is well aware of this. As she enters the eighth year since independence, she faces the future with confidence, hope, and determination in order to realize her destiny among the nations of the world.

China is a great Asian country. We regard her as a great neighbor, and therefore we feel that her achievements in all aspects of national activity are a great source of pride and happiness for her people. Like Pakistan, China must also face many difficulties, but we are pleased to see that these difficulties are being overcome. We are pleased to note that New China has successfully restored her economy in a short period of time and put the country on the path of construction. We hail China's achievements with admiration and sincerely hope that she can successfully complete all her national construction plans.

Not long ago, Asia experienced many developments of great significance. After a long and arduous struggle aimed at achieving peace in Korea, the bloodshed finally stopped. Similarly, in Indochina, an armed conflict was still raging until recently. Everyone is eager for the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of a peaceful environment in this unfortunate land. But for some reason, the parties concerned failed to reach an agreement.

It was in this situation that the Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan held a meeting in Colombo at the end of April this year. They exchanged views and discussed issues of common interest and concern to them. Among these issues, they also discussed the Indochina issue and expressed their views in a joint communique. Their hopes were not dashed, and after a series of continuous negotiations, the Geneva Conference finally succeeded in achieving a peaceful resolution in Indochina.

I feel that I should mention here that the delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Geneva Conference, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, played a very prominent role in the negotiations and made a great contribution to the peaceful resolution of Indochina. I believe that I should express my heartfelt congratulations to His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai for this achievement. The Government and people of Pakistan express their sincere joy at the signing of the Indochina ceasefire agreements, and hope that the spirit of mutual reconciliation that permeated the negotiation process will also be used to implement these agreements.

Pakistan has always longed for the progress of peace and understanding throughout the world, especially in Asia. To achieve this goal, Pakistan is eager to cooperate with the whole world, especially with Asian countries. Faced with the enormous problems of consolidating and building the country, she is willing to obtain peace at any cost. Pakistan believes that peace is often the result of a "give and take policy" between countries based on equality, mutual respect for security, sovereignty, and independence. Based on this belief, Pakistan holds the most friendly feelings towards all countries.

Pakistan has no reason or justification to adopt a hostile attitude towards any country, especially towards her Asian neighbors. Thus, from the very beginning, Pakistan has strived to cultivate and develop the most pleasant and friendly relations with the People's Republic of China. She is wholeheartedly committed to further developing the pleasant and harmonious relations that already exist between the two countries. In this spirit, on the occasion of celebrating the achievements of Pakistan's independence, I would like to express my gratitude to our guest of honor, His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for attending. I have just returned from a vacation in my country, and I have brought with me the respect of the Government and people of Pakistan for the Government and people of China.

Please allow me to ask everyone to join me in raising a glass to the pleasant relations between Pakistan and China and to the health and happiness of His Excellency Chairman Mao Zedong. (Summary according to Xinhua News Agency)

### 罗查大使在招待会上的讲话

    罗查大使在招待会上的讲话阁下、女士们、先生们：
    今天我们庆祝实现独立的第七周年。这一天每个巴基斯坦人都在回顾他们国家的成就，以便检查一下已经完成的和留待以后去完成的工作。因此这一天对我们来说是需要深思熟虑，同时也是非常愉快的一天。
    今天，当我们回顾在过去七年中我们为巩固和建设（我们国家）所作的斗争时，我们在我们的成就中找到了充分的鼓励。但是我们的成就确实是不完备的，还有很多事情留待要做。我国对此点是很了解的。当她进入独立以来的第八个年头的时候，她满怀着信心，希望与决心来面对将来，以便实现她在世界各国之中所处的命运。
    中国是一个伟大的亚洲国家。我们把她看作一个伟大的邻邦，因而我们体会到她在国家活动各方面的成就便是其人民极大的骄傲与幸福。像巴基斯坦一样，中国也必须面对许多困难，但我们高兴地看到这些困难正被克服中。我们愉快地注意到：新中国在短时期内已成功地恢复了她的经济，并且使国家走上了建设的道路。我们怀着敬佩的心情欢呼中国的成就并且诚恳地希望她能成功地完成其全部国家建设计划。
    不久以前亚洲经历了许多具有重大意义的发展。经历了一个长期艰巨的旨在朝鲜获致和平的斗争之后，流血终于停止了。相似地，在印度支那一场武装冲突直至最近还在厮杀。每个人都切望在这不幸的土地上敌对行为应予终止，和平的环境应予恢复。但是由于某些原因有关方面未能获致协议。
    就在这种情况之下，缅甸、锡兰、印度、印尼和巴基斯坦总理于今年四月底在科伦坡举行了会议。他们交换了意见，讨论了与他们有共同利益及关系的问题。在这些问题中，他们也讨论了印度支那问题并在联合公报中发表了他们的意见。他们的希望并没有落空，在经过一系列持续的谈判之后，日内瓦会议终于使印度支那的和平解决得到成功。
    我觉得应该在这里提到出席日内瓦会议的以周恩来总理为首的中华人民共和国代表团，周总理在谈判中曾起了非常卓越的作用，并对印度支那获得和平解决作了巨大的贡献。我认为由于这一成就我应向周恩来总理阁下表示衷心的祝贺。巴基斯坦政府和人民对印度支那停战协定的签订表示真诚的喜悦，并希望贯串于谈判过程中的相互和解精神亦将用以实施这些协定。
    巴基斯坦一向渴望全世界，特别是亚洲的和平与谅解能够得到进展。为了达到这一目的，巴基斯坦迫切希望与全世界，特别是亚洲各国相互合作。面对着巩固及建设国家的巨大问题，她愿以任何代价取得和平。巴基斯坦认为和平往往是世界各国间以平等、互相尊重安全、主权与独立为基础的“给与取政策”的结果。基于对这一原则的信念，巴基斯坦对一切国家都抱着最友好的情感。
    巴基斯坦没有原因及理由对任何国家尤其是对她的亚洲邻国采取敌对态度。这样，巴基斯坦从一开始就努力栽培及发展与中华人民共和国间最愉快与最友好的关系。她一心一意地要进一步发展已经存在于两国之间的愉快与融洽的关系。基于这种精神，在庆祝巴基斯坦独立的成就的佳节时，我谨向我们的主宾周恩来总理阁下表示谢意，并感谢阁下、各位女士、先生光临参加。我刚从国内休假归来，我并带来了巴基斯坦政府与人民对中国政府及人民的敬意。
    请允许我请求大家和我一同举杯祝巴基斯坦与中国间的愉快的关系并祝毛泽东主席阁下的健康与幸福。　（据新华社的摘要）
