    East China Region Provinces and Cities Secondary Schools
    Increase Enrollment Quotas This Autumn
    The East China region's provinces and cities have increased enrollment quotas for secondary schools this autumn. This year, regular secondary schools across the region will enroll over 379,000 new senior and junior high school students, an increase of nearly 110,000 compared to last year. Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools will enroll over 9,600 new students, an increase of over 6,800 compared to last year.
    To welcome the large number of new students this year, the construction of 494 newly built and expanded regular secondary schools in various provinces and cities is currently underway, with most expected to be completed before the autumn semester begins. The total construction area of these schools is over 452,000 square meters. According to statistics from Shandong, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, the completion of newly built and expanded school buildings in various schools will add over 1,500 classrooms, as well as many new laboratories, libraries, and student dormitories. In Fujian, Shanghai, and other places, many schools are also actively adjusting classes and implementing a "two-shift system" to maximize the opportunity for primary and junior high school graduates to continue their education. After some public and private secondary schools in Shanghai implemented the "two-shift system" of teaching, they can enroll over 11,000 more new junior high school students and over 4,400 more new senior high school students. In Shanghai, two secondary remedial schools have also been converted into regular secondary schools, and six remedial schools have added junior high school classes. The people's governments of various provinces and cities have adopted measures such as transferring cadres suitable for teaching work, promoting primary school teachers, and recruiting and training new teachers to strengthen the teaching staff of newly built, expanded, and expanded-class schools.
