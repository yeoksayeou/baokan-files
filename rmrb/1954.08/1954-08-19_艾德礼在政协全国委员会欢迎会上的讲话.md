Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:

I thank you for your kind words of welcome. We are very pleased to be able to meet with you all. Our purpose in coming to China is to get to know you better and to enhance understanding between the British and Chinese people. During the long struggle of the Chinese people against Japanese imperialism and against internal reactionary forces in China, we sympathized with the Chinese people. We sincerely wish the new China prosperity. You have a culture far older than ours, and now you are engaged in the work of making tremendous changes in accordance with modern needs.

For our relatively young culture with different traditions, our Labour Party has made extensive changes to realize the aspirations of the working masses in our country. We are fortunate to be able to do this through peaceful and constitutional means. We must not only deal with domestic problems, but also deal with the foreign problems faced by Britain standing in the historical position of a world power. Because we recognize the right of all nations to govern themselves, we recognize the equal rights of the Asian people. We are very happy today that India, Pakistan, and Ceylon are cooperating with us and the older Commonwealth members on a free and equal basis. Our Burmese friends have chosen an independent path outside the Federation, but we remain good friends. The same thing is happening in other parts of the world, especially in West Africa. Freedom is important, but not enough. It is precisely because we want to improve the living standards of our own people that we are willing to help other countries do the same.

We would like to see the scientific knowledge and technology developed in the West be available to all people.

We know how enormous are the tasks facing the Chinese People's Government, which controls the destiny of more than 600 million people. Part of our philosophy is that all these people have the right to the richest life. The purpose of the government is not the power of the country, but the happiness of everyone.

The differences between the Chinese people and the British people in their history and way of life are very great, but we are willing to try to often think of what we have in common rather than our differences. First and foremost is the desire for peace. We know the suffering China has endured in war. We suffered in both World Wars, and our best young people were sacrificed in these two wars. We endured many days and nights of bombing, and many men, women, old, and young were killed. We firmly advocate that war must stop.

This will allow for a simple family life. When we see Chinese fathers, mothers, and children here, we think of our own families at home.

The task of those who hold responsible positions in the world is to create conditions so that these families, regardless of race, can live happily, free from the threat of war, free from the threat of hunger, and enjoy freedom of thought and action, while respecting the rights of others. We do not want to offer you opinions on how to handle your problems, but you can be sure of this: if at any time our assistance and experience can be of help to you, we will provide it without compensation. On our part, we also hope to learn from you.

On behalf of the British Labour Party delegation, I would like to express our respect to the people we represent.

It is unnecessary to spend time on formal greetings. Our coming here is sufficient to show our support for the Chinese people's revolution. As Mr. Attlee said, the Labour movement's response to the Chinese revolution is the same as the support given to the Russian revolution after the First World War. The struggle of British workers against capitalist forces in their own country naturally makes them immediately sympathetic to the struggles of workers in other countries.

This struggle takes various forms because it is carried out under different historical conditions. These conditions do not determine the ultimate goal of socialism, but they affect the methods of achieving socialism and the process of change. There is no universally applicable formula for social progress. If there were such a formula, our task would be easy. In every political environment, there are two factors: the nature of the goals we set for ourselves, and the traditions upon which we must rely in pursuing these goals. When we ignore national and historical traditions in our struggle for our goals, then we run the risk of not understanding the attitude of the masses we represent. Therefore, socialism is by no means empty preaching of principles, but a living reality that must find vitality in the actual struggle environment.

I say this because some people often judge the European situation by Asian standards, just as there are also those who judge Europeans by the situation in Asia or elsewhere. Only by studying the specific circumstances of each event can we obtain reliable insights. If socialist tactics are formulated like rigid dogmas, then they lack relevance to the needs of the time and place.

For example, the situation in many European countries differs from the past and present situation in Asia in two important aspects. First, most European societies have fully developed democratic constitutions that provide the possibility for a more peaceful and orderly transformation of society. Decentralizing political power among the masses and obeying the decisions of the majority through parliament have turned the right to participate in government into a tool of revolution, if we resolutely and forcefully use the above methods. We have no illusions that reactionary forces will obstruct when the people use their political power to achieve socialism. If we do not recognize that political democracy itself is a political force, then we think it is naive and useless. British socialists believe that some people who call themselves revolutionaries do not recognize the progressive nature of parliamentary representation, thus rendering themselves politically useless.

The second aspect in which we differ from you and many countries in your region is that your struggle is also a struggle for national independence against imperialism. This has resulted in the fact that the emotions arising from national self-consciousness and the desire for liberation exceed the social struggle. Therefore, you have a emotional impetus that we do not have. This situation enables your country to mobilize some sections of the population to fight for socialism, and these people, we cannot mobilize to the same extent. People who differ from you in many political and economic goals are still prepared to work with you because you have provided and are still providing the only way to liberate your country from foreign control. This is supported by increasingly deep and lasting emotions in your struggle. This gives your struggle a sharper weapon, allowing you to break away from traditional forms of struggle more deeply and quickly.

The main source of differences between us is precisely this combination of national struggle and social struggle. If we do not understand this, then we will not be able to understand each other's positions. It is the reason why our movement has progressed more slowly. At the same time, it also explains why we can avoid many of the sacrifices that you have had to make. We hope that our visit and this discussion can enable us to better understand each other's positions.

There is one factor that may appear before us that will immediately raise the political temperature in Europe, and that is the threat of war. The consequences of a war fought with modern weapons are so terrible for all mankind that preventing such a war has now become the primary consideration for the people of all countries. How to have both progress and maintain peace - this is the task of our generation. A state of stagnation cannot be the basis for peace. This is what the maintainers of the old order cannot see.

Collective security cannot be based on the social status quo. People must be allowed to improve their destiny, and their efforts in this regard should not be condemned as part of a conspiracy to impose a certain ideology on others. At the same time, it must be recognized that modern war no longer makes it possible to produce successful social revolutions. Just as modern scientific industrial technology has made political enslavement impossible, modern war may lead us all to destruction. Therefore, it must be made possible for people to realize their legitimate national and social aspirations without war or the threat of war.

Therefore, accepting peaceful coexistence is not only a condition for human survival, but must also have its positive role. In addition to coexistence, we must add cooperation, including cultural, commercial, and economic exchanges. Our policy should not be based on the leadership of this or that country, no matter how powerful that country may be, but on the basis that all countries, large and small, are equal. It should not be based on seeking a group of countries that agree on everything, but on allowing various differences to exist and being able to express those differences to each other. Every country's revolution is based on previous revolutions, learning from previous revolutions, but not necessarily imitating them in every aspect. It is in this spirit that we are visiting your country. I am sure we will also leave your country in the same spirit. We believe that your future is brighter than the experience of your long and courageous struggle, and that the Chinese people will reap the fruits of their sacrifices in peace.

### 艾德礼在政协全国委员会欢迎会上的讲话

    艾德礼在政协全国委员会欢迎会上的讲话主席先生、诸位女士、诸位先生：
    我感谢您的亲切的欢迎词。我们能和你们诸位见面，非常愉快。我们来中国的目的，是要想更好地认识你们，和增进英国人民与中国人民之间的了解。在中国人民反对日本帝国主义和反对中国内部反动势力的长期斗争中，我们是同情中国人民的。我们衷心祝望新中国的昌盛。你们有远较我们古老的文化，现在你们正从事于按照现代需要进行巨大变革的工作。
    对于我们具有不同传统的比较年轻的文化，我们工党进行了广泛的变革，以实现我国劳动群众的愿望。我们很幸运，能够通过和平的与宪法的办法来做这件工作。我们不但要处理国内问题，而且要处理英国站在一个世界大国的历史地位所面临的对外问题。由于我们承认一切民族应有管理他们自己的权利，我们承认亚洲人民的平等权利。我们今天很高兴印度、巴基斯坦和锡兰在自由和平等的基础上和我们以及较老的英联邦成员国合作。我们的缅甸朋友选择了在联邦以外独立的道路，但是我们仍然是好朋友。同样的事情在世界的其他地区也在进行着，特别是在西非洲。自由是重要的，但是不够的。正是因为我们要提高本国人民的生活水平，所以我们愿意帮助其他国家进行同样的工作。
    我们愿意看到西方所发展的科学知识和技术能够为各国人民所利用。
    我们知道掌握着六亿多人民的命运的中国人民政府所面临的任务是如何的巨大。我们的哲学的一部分就是所有这些人都有要求最丰富的生活的权利。政府的目的不是国家的权利，而是每个人的幸福。
    中国人民和英国人民在他们的历史和生活方式方面的差别是很大的，但是我们愿意设法常常想到我们之间的共同点而不是不同点。首先就是和平的愿望。我们知道中国在战争中受到的苦难。在两次大战中我们是受过苦难的，我们最好的青年都在这两次大战中牺牲了。我们忍受过许多日夜的轰炸，许多男女老幼被炸死了。我们坚决主张：战争必须停止。
    这样就可以有简朴的家庭生活。当我们在这里看到中国的父亲、母亲和孩子们的时候，我们想起了我们国内自己的家庭。
    在世界上担任负责职位的人的任务就是创造条件，使这些家庭不论是什么种族，都可以幸福地生活，不受战争恐惧的威胁，不受饥饿恐惧的威胁，并且享受思想与行动的自由，而同时尊重别人的权利，我们并不要向你们提出关于怎样处理你们的问题的意见，但是你们可以肯定这样的一点，那就是：如果在任何时候我们的协助和经验能够对你们有帮助的话，我们将无代价地提供出来。在我们这方面，我们也希望向你们学习。
    我谨代表英国工党代表团，向你们表示我们所代表的人们的敬意。
    为正式的致意而花费时间是不必要的。我们到这里来，本身就足以表示我们对中国人民革命的支持。正如艾德礼先生所说的，工党运动对中国革命的反应，是和在第一次世界大战后对俄国革命所给予的支持一样的。英国工人在他们自己国内反对资本主义势力的斗争，使他们很自然地对其他国家工人的斗争立即给予同情。
    这个斗争采取着各种不同的形式，因为是在不同的历史条件下进行的。这种条件并不决定社会主义的最终目的，但是它影响着达到社会主义的方法以及变化的进程。对社会进步来说，并没有一种普遍适用的公式。如果有这种公式的话，我们的任务就容易了。在每个政治环境中，都有两个因素，那就是我们自己决定的目标的性质，和在追求这些目标时所必须依据的传统。当我们为我们的目标斗争的时候，忽视了民族的和历史的传统，那么，我们就会使我们有不了解我们所代表的群众的态度的危险。因此，社会主义决不是空洞的原则说教，而是活生生的现实，这个活生生的现实要在实际的斗争环境中找到生命力。
    我这样说，是因为某些人常以亚洲的标准来判断欧洲情况，正如也有一种按亚洲或其他地方的情况来判断欧洲人。只有研究每个事件的具体情况，我们才能得到可靠的见解。如果把社会主义策略制定得像死板的教条一样，那么，它就和当时当地的需要缺乏关联。
    比如，许多欧洲国家的情况，在两个重要方面与亚洲过去和目前的情况都是不同的。首先，大多数欧洲社会都有了充分发展的民主的宪法，这些宪法为较为和平而有秩序地改造社会提供了可能性。将政治权力分散于群众当中，和通过议会服从大多数人的决议，这样就把参政权变成了革命的工具，假如我们坚决有力地运用上述方法的话。当人民为达到社会主义而运用他们的政治权力的时候，反动势力会加以阻挠，对这一点，我们并没有错觉。假如，不承认政治民主本身是一政治力量，那我们认为就是幼稚而无用的。英国社会主义者认为，有些自称为革命家的人，不承认议会代表制的进取性，因而就造成这些人在政治上的无用。
    我们与你们以及在你们地区中许多国家不同的第二方面，就是你们的斗争同时也是反对帝国主义的民族独立斗争。这就产生了一种结果，就是由于对民族自觉和要求解放的愿望而生的感情超过了社会斗争。因此，你们有了一种我们所没有的感情动力。这种情况使你们国家能够动员人口中一些部分为社会主义而奋斗，而这些人，我们就不能动员到同等程度。与你们许多政治和经济目标不同的人，仍准备与你们一起工作，因为你们提供了而且还在提供使你们国家从外国控制中获得解放的唯一方法。这就有着日益加深的持久感情来支持你们的斗争。这就使你们的斗争有了更尖锐的武器，从而使你们能够更深刻更迅速地摆脱传统的斗争形式。
    我们之间的主要不同的来源正是这种民族斗争与社会斗争的结合。假使不了解这一点，那么我们将不能互相了解双方的立场。它是我们的运动进展得比较迟缓的原因。同时它也说明了为什么我们可以不作许多你们不得不作的牺牲。我们希望我们的访问与这次讨论可以使我们更好地了解相互的立场。
    有一种因素可能会出现在我们的面前，这个因素会立即使欧洲的政治热度上升，这就是战争的威胁。用现代化武器进行的战争的后果对全人类都是如此的可怕，以至于防止这样的战争现在已经成为各国人民的首要的考虑了。怎样才能又有进步，又能维持和平——这就是我们一代的任务。停滞不前的状态不能成为和平的基础。这就是旧秩序的维护者所不能看到的事情。
    集体安全是不能以社会现状为基础的。必须让人民能够改善他们的命运，同时他们在这方面所作的努力不会被谴责为把某种思想强加于别人的阴谋的一部分。同时也必须承认，现代化战争不再有可能产生成功的社会革命。正如现代科学的工业技术已使政治上的奴役成为不可能一样。现代化的战争可能会使我们全都趋于毁灭。因此，必须使人民有可能不经过战争或战争威胁就可以实现他们的正当的民族愿望和社会愿望。
    因此，接受和平共处不仅仅是人类生存的条件，而且也必须有其积极的作用。共处之外，我们必须加上包括文化、商业和经济交流在内的合作。我们的政策不应建立在这一个或那一个国家领导权的基础上，不论那个国家多末强大，而应建立在所有大大小小的国家都平等的基础上。不应建立在寻求事事一致的国家集团上，而应建立在容许各种分歧存在而且能相互表示分歧的基础上。每一个国家的革命都是以以前的革命为依据的，向以前的革命学习，但却不一定要在每一方面都去仿效。我们就是以这样的精神来访问贵国的。我确信我们也将本着同样的精神离开贵国。我们相信你们的前途比起你们长期勇敢的斗争的经历来得光明，中国人民将会在和平中收获他们的牺牲结成的果实。
