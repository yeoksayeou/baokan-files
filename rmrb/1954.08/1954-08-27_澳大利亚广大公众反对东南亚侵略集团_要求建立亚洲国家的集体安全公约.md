Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: The Australian "Tribune" reported on the 18th under the title "Workers Oppose Southeast Asia Treaty Organization": The recent national annual meeting of the Building Workers' Industrial Union in Sydney passed a resolution expressing firm opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and supporting "the development of trade and the maintenance of friendly relations with all Asian countries." The resolution believes that this is the road to peace, and argues: "Any proposed convention should be a collective security convention including all Asian countries, including People's China."

The Railway Factory Committee Council unanimously passed a resolution at a meeting held in the Sydney area on August 15, accusing the Menzies government of supporting the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, saying that this action betrayed those who sacrificed their lives in World War II for lasting peace in the Pacific. The resolution opposes the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, accusing it of being "a conspiracy to launch a war of aggression against the people of Asia." The resolution states: "We do not want aggressive actions like the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization; we need a policy of friendly relations."

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: Australian figures oppose the US-orchestrated Southeast Asia Aggression Bloc.

The Australian "Tribune" reported on the 18th: Labor parliamentarians Calwell and Ward criticized the government's plan to drag Australia into the war-mongering Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Calwell said: "What the world needs today is a new order that was promised after the war but has never been fulfilled. Asians are unwilling to fight to maintain the old order, for hunger, bloodshed and tears."

Ward accused the Menzies government of wanting to completely sacrifice Australia's national independence in its relationship with the United States.

Former Australian Secretary of the Department of External Affairs, John Burton, recently pointed out in a letter to the "Canberra Times" that the proposed Southeast Asia Treaty Organization violates the UN Charter. Burton said that Chapter VIII of the UN Charter deals with the issue of regional institutions, but by no means supports military alliances. The addition of this chapter to the UN Charter was entirely intended to prevent the formation of such power blocs. In his recently compiled book "Another Road," Burton pointed out that the road of "following the United States" means: "When the 'following the United States' line overrides consideration of Australia's vital interests, a truly dangerous situation will arise in Australia." Burton also pointed out that the US, Australia, and New Zealand "Security Treaty" is a threat to Australia's security, as it makes Australia involved in any war actions that the United States may take.

    澳大利亚广大公众反对东南亚侵略集团
    要求建立亚洲国家的集体安全公约
  【新华社二十五日讯】澳大利亚“论坛报”十八日以“工人们反对东南亚公约组织”为标题报道说：最近在悉尼举行的建筑工人工会全国年会通过决议，表示坚决反对东南亚公约组织，支持“和一切亚洲国家发展贸易并保持友好关系”。决议认为，这是走向和平的道路，并且主张：“拟议中的任何公约都应该是包括人民中国在内的所有亚洲国家都参加的集体安全公约”。
    铁路工厂委员会理事会八月十五日在悉尼地区举行的大会上一致通过了一项决议，指责孟席斯政府支持东南亚公约组织的行动，说这种行动辜负了那些为了太平洋的持久和平而在第二次世界大战中献出了自己的生命的人们。决议反对东南亚公约组织，指责这种组织是“对亚洲人民发动侵略战争的一个阴谋”。决议说：“我们不要东南亚公约组织之类的侵略行动，我们需要友好关系的政策”。
   【新华社二十六日讯】澳大利亚人士反对美国策划中的东南亚侵略集团。
    澳大利亚“论坛报”十八日报道：工党议员卡尔韦尔和华德对政府的把澳大利亚拖入制造战争的东南亚公约组织的计划提出了指责。卡尔韦尔说：“今天的世界需要的是战后许诺过的但是一直没有兑现的新秩序。亚洲人是不愿意为保持旧秩序、为饥饿、流血和眼泪而作战的。”
    华德指责孟席斯政府在对美国的关系中，想完全牺牲澳大利亚的民族独立。
    前澳大利亚外交部秘书长约翰·博尔顿最近在给“堪培拉时报”的一封信中指出，拟议中的东南亚公约组织是违反联合国宪章的。博尔顿说，联合国宪章第八章谈到了区域机构问题，但是决不是支持军事联盟，联合国宪章中加上这一章完全是有意阻止成立这种势力集团的。博尔顿在他最近编的一本叫做“另一条道路”的书中指出，“追随美国”路线的道路意味着：“当‘追随美国’路线压倒了对澳大利亚重大利益的考虑时，在澳大利亚将产生一种真正危险的形势”。博尔顿并指出，美、澳、新三国“安全条约”对澳大利亚安全是一个威胁，它使澳大利亚受到美国可能采取的任何战争行动的牵连。
