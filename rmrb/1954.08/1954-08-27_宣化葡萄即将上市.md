	Xuanhua Grapes About to Hit the Market

	Although Xuanhua City, Hebei Province's grapes suffered from wind, hail, black spot disease, sunburn and other disasters this year, it is estimated that production will still increase by 700,000 jin compared to last year. The people of Xuanhua have cultivated grapes for more than 200 years. Since liberation, the people's government has vigorously supported and helped the people develop grape cultivation, promptly issuing fertilizer and trellis loans, and providing technical guidance, grape production has increased year by year: last year, production was 2.3 million jin, exceeding the pre-liberation annual output by 25 percent. At present, early-maturing grapes have begun to enter the market. The Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative and Food Company are signing purchase contracts with local agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and farmers are also making preparations before leaving the orchard. Xuanhua grapes will soon be available in large quantities. (Chen Guohua)

    宣化葡萄即将上市
    河北省宣化市的葡萄，今年虽然遭受了风、雹和黑痘病、曝病等灾害的侵袭，估计仍可比去年增产七十万斤。宣化人民栽培葡萄已有二百余年的历史。解放以后，人民政府大力扶植，帮助人民发展葡萄种植业，及时发放肥料和架杆贷款，并给予技术上的指导，葡萄产量已逐年增加：去年生产二百三十万斤，超过解放前年产量百分之二十五。目前，早熟葡萄已开始上市，北京市供销合作社和食品公司正与当地农业社和互助组签订收购合同，农民也在进行出园前的准备工作。宣化葡萄不久即可大量上市。　（陈国华）
