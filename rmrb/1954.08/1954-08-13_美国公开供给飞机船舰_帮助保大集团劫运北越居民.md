Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: U.S. imperialists are openly using airplanes and ships to help the Ngô Đình Diệm Group forcibly transport North Vietnamese residents to the South. According to U.S. news agency reports, in order to accelerate the forced relocation, the U.S. has allocated four DC-4 transport planes and fifteen DC-3 transport planes to the Ngô Đình Diệm Group. Simultaneously, a transport fleet belonging to the U.S. Western Pacific Amphibious Force arrived at Haiphong Port in North Vietnam on the 9th, preparing to participate in the forced relocation. The commander of this force, Sabin, is currently active in North Vietnam, inspecting the dock facilities in Haiphong, and is discussing forced relocation plans in Hanoi with French and Bảo Đại officials, along with O'Daniel, the head of the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in Indochina. In addition, the U.S. has transferred two "refugee problem experts" stationed in West Germany and Hong Kong to Saigon to participate in the forced relocation activities.

The U.S. participation in the forced relocation activities has become more active after the U.S. State Department issued a note to the Bảo Đại regime on August 8th. In this note, the U.S. State Department openly stated that it would "closely cooperate" with the Bảo Đại regime in the work of forcibly relocating residents. U.S. Ambassador to Indochina, Heath, also notified the Bảo Đại Foreign Ministry, expressing willingness to bear the costs required for the forced relocation. Encouraged by the U.S., Bảo Đại's Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm personally flew to North Vietnam to arrange deceptive propaganda and appointed the puppet Minister of Information to preside over the forced relocation work.

Despite the Ngô Đình Diệm Group's intensified threats and deceptive activities, most North Vietnamese residents are unwilling to leave their homes, which are about to be fully liberated. Their strong desire to live a happy life under the leadership of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam cannot be concealed even by French and American reporters. "France Soir" reporter Bodard, in a dispatch from Hanoi on the 9th, said: "People in the Tonkin Delta are increasingly unwilling to leave. Even the Catholics are not moving." Bodard attacked the Ngô Đình Diệm puppet regime's "incompetence" in the message, saying that it was "completely unable to organize the general retreat from the communist North to South Vietnam." An Associated Press reporter also acknowledged in a report on the 9th that "even among the Catholics in the Delta, many have decided to stay, and their Vietnamese bishop is no longer urging them to leave. The Bishop of Bắc Ninh announced: 'I am determined to stay in my parish, and I wish my parishioners to stay as well.'" An Associated Press reporter said in another telegram: "French observers" are worried that only Bảo Đại government officials, military officers, and a relatively small number of other people will leave.

### 美国公开供给飞机船舰  帮助保大集团劫运北越居民

　　美国公开供给飞机船舰
    帮助保大集团劫运北越居民
    【新华社十二日讯】美帝国主义者正公开以飞机、船舰帮助吴庭艳集团向南劫运北越居民。据美国通讯社消息，为了加速劫运工作，美国已将四架DC—4型运输机和十五架DC—3型运输机拨给吴庭艳集团。同时，属于美国西太平洋两栖部队的一队运输舰已在九日开抵北越海防港，准备参加劫运。该部队司令萨宾目前正在北越活动，视察海防的船坞设备，并和美国驻印度支那“军事援助顾问团”团长奥丹尼尔一起在河内与法国及保大官员商谈劫运计划。此外，美国已将驻在西德和香港的两个“难民问题专家”调往西贡，参加劫运活动。
    美国参与劫运活动是在美国国务院于八日发表致保大政权的照会后更加积极起来的。美国国务院在这一照会中，公开表示要在劫运居民的工作中与保大政权“密切合作”。美国驻印度支那大使海斯并曾通知保大外交部，表示愿负担劫运所需的费用。在美国的鼓励下，保大政府总理吴庭艳曾亲自飞往北越，布置欺骗宣传，并任命伪情报部部长主持劫运工作。
    尽管吴庭艳集团加紧威胁和欺骗活动，大多数北越居民都不愿意离开他们即将全部解放的家园。他们盼望在越南民主共和国政府领导下过幸福生活的强烈意愿，连法国和美国的记者们也无法掩饰。“法兰西晚报”记者波达尔九日从河内发出的消息说：“东京三角洲的人越来越不愿意离开。甚至那些天主教徒们也没有动静了。”波达尔在消息中攻击吴庭艳傀儡政权的“无能”，“完全无力组织从共产党的北方到南越的总撤退的工作”。美国合众社记者在九日的报道中也承认，“甚至在三角洲的天主教徒中，有许多人都已决定留下，他们的越南籍主教也不再敦促他们离开了。北宁的主教宣布：‘我决心留在我的教区内，愿我的教徒们也留下。’”合众社记者在另一则电讯中又说：“法国观察家”担心，离开的将只有保大政府官员、军官以及数目相当少的其他一些人。
