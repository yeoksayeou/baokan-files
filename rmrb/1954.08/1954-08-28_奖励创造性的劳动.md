Rewarding Creative Labor

The creative talents of the working people of our country are receiving the greatest attention and care. Mass inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals have become important factors in developing our national economy. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government constantly educate and urge leading cadres and Party organizations in enterprises to value the wisdom of the masses and be good at bringing it into play, and to conduct serious criticism and struggle against bureaucrats who suppress the initiative and creativity of the masses. The Party and the government bestow the highest honor on innovators among the masses, publicize and promote their achievements, and stimulate and reward their creative labor materially.

In August 1950, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Rewarding Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production." This decision powerfully promoted the nationwide rationalization proposal movement. In recent years, under the call and support of the Party and the government, the broad masses of workers and staff across the country have put forward many proposals, solved many key problems in production, and played a major role in improving technology, increasing production, improving product quality, reducing costs, improving operating conditions, and ensuring production safety, creating a large amount of wealth for the country. According to incomplete statistics, in 1950, 24,875 suggestions made by workers and staff in thirteen cities across the country were adopted. According to statistics from six major administrative regions in nine months of 1951, the number of rationalization proposals adopted reached 100,8528. In 1950, the value saved by the railway system through the adoption of various suggestions was 23.2 billion yuan; in the year from October 1951 to September 1952, the units under the Ministry of Heavy Industry saved 309 billion yuan due to the adoption of employee suggestions; in 1953, state-owned cotton mills in Tianjin increased the country's wealth by more than 3.99 billion yuan due to the adoption of suggestions.

However, because the reward standards and calculation methods in various regions and industries in the past were often inconsistent, the sources of bonuses were also different, and there was no special management agency or the special management agency was not sound, the bonuses given for suggestions of similar value often varied greatly, and there were phenomena such as the accumulation of mass suggestions or untimely rewards. This situation hindered the further development of the mass invention, technical improvement, and rationalization proposal movement. At present, due to the recovery of the national economy and the start of planned construction, in order to further increase output and quality on the already achieved production level, increase new products, improve labor productivity and reduce costs, and overcome new difficulties in the construction process, it is necessary to carry out mass technical innovation movement on the basis of promoting advanced experience and rationalization proposal mass movement, further tap the potential strength of enterprises, and raise labor productivity higher. This requires further effective play to the creative labor of the broad masses of workers and staff. Under such circumstances, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Rewarding Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production" in a timely manner, which is a very important measure.

Undoubtedly, the promulgation of this regulation will powerfully stimulate and concentrate the wisdom hidden in the masses, overcome the difficulties in the construction process, better complete the country's plans, and accelerate the speed of our country's national economic development. The regulations stipulate that workers, engineering technicians, and staff who actively assist others in realizing suggestions should also be given appropriate rewards. This provision will encourage all employees, especially enterprise leaders and engineering technicians, to vigorously support and assist suggesters, greatly promote the collective creative spirit of the working masses, and promote mutual assistance and cooperation between engineering technicians and workers. The regulations also stipulate specific and scientific calculation methods to ensure that each suggestion will receive corresponding and reasonable rewards based on the size of its contribution to the country, avoiding the phenomenon of disproportionately light or heavy rewards for large contributions versus small rewards, as well as egalitarian rewards regardless of the size of the contribution. This strict calculation can also prevent bad behaviors such as falsely reporting achievements and fraudulently obtaining bonuses.

In order to correctly implement this regulation, it is necessary to correct some incorrect views on the country's reward policy. Some management cadres in enterprises do not understand the importance of the reward policy, believing that as long as political and ideological work is carried out to improve the political and ideological awareness of employees, there is no need for material rewards; implementing material rewards will only encourage economism among employees. These people do not understand that it is not enough to rely solely on political and ideological work to encourage their creative enthusiasm, not only among highly conscious advanced elements, but also among millions of ordinary people; it is also necessary to stimulate people's concern for their own labor results from the perspective of material interests. Doing so not only does no harm, but can also make the broad masses of working people more deeply understand the superiority of our social system, understand the socialist principle of "to each according to his work," recognize the unity of national interests and individual interests, and further enhance their thinking of struggling for collective welfare.

Of course, it is also wrong to think that material reward is the only method, thus neglecting the huge role of political work. If it is believed that with this regulation, political work can be abandoned, and workers' inventions and creations can be stimulated purely with economic benefits, without educating them to understand the political significance of inventions and creations, and enlightening and improving their socialist consciousness, then the role of the regulations cannot be brought into play, and it may even promote the development of backward consciousness among the masses, causing some employees to generate bad thoughts and behaviors such as conservatism, jealousy, fraud, and harming others for their own benefit, making them unable to see the great future of the working class, only caring about personal material interests. This will not only fail to vigorously develop creative labor, but will also weaken the combat effectiveness of the working class and cause losses to the country's construction undertakings. We must combine the implementation of the reward regulations with educating employees to recognize the consistency of national interests and individual interests, recognize that only on the basis of continuous improvement in production can their lives be continuously improved, and recognize that in order to realize socialism as soon as possible, creative labor must be carried out and work must be treated with a spirit of innovation. Only in this way can the country's reward policy play a greater role.

We must also never think that, with the promulgation of this reward regulation by the Government Administration Council, the mass technological innovation movement will naturally develop without leadership. This idea is very wrong. The reward regulation can only be one of the factors that promote the creative labor of the masses, but it cannot replace leadership over it. To fully utilize the wisdom and creative spirit of the masses and make the technological innovation movement mass-based, it is also necessary to carry out a series of organizational and educational work. It is necessary to strive to improve the management level of enterprises and the leadership level of labor competitions, strengthen technical work and technical education in enterprises, and, in particular, tirelessly struggle against bureaucracy that does not believe in and does not value the wisdom of the masses and blocks the creative spirit of the masses, create conditions for carrying out rationalization proposals and technological innovation movements from all aspects, and improve labor competitions. Only in this way can this reward regulation promulgated by the Government Administration Council be well implemented and play its due role.

In order to respond to the support and care of the Party and the government for the creative labor of the masses, the broad masses of workers and staff should participate in the ranks of technological innovation with greater enthusiasm, and strive to fully utilize existing production equipment capacity, continuously improve labor productivity, continuously reduce costs, and continuously improve the technical level of employees. Administrative leaders and Party organizations in enterprises, as well as trade union and youth league organizations, must correctly use and implement this regulation of the Government Administration Council, fully promote the creative spirit of the masses, and concentrate the wisdom of the masses, so that it becomes a driving force for completing national plans.

    奖励创造性的劳动
    我国劳动人民的创造才能受到最大的重视和关怀。群众性的发明、技术改进和合理化建议，已成为发展我国国民经济的重要因素。中国共产党和人民政府经常教育和督促企业中的领导干部和党的组织，要重视群众的智慧和善于发挥群众的智慧，并向压制群众的积极性和创造性的官僚主义者进行严肃的批评和斗争。党和政府把最高的荣誉给予群众中的革新者，宣扬和推广他们的成就，并且从物质上激发和奖励他们的创造性劳动。
    一九五○年八月，中央人民政府政务院曾颁布了“关于奖励有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的决定”。这个决定，有力地推动了全国的合理化建议运动。几年来，在党和政府的号召和支持下，全国广大职工群众提出了很多建议，解决了生产中的许多关键问题，对改进技术、增加生产、提高产品质量、降低成本、改善作业条件、保障生产安全等方面起了重大作用，给国家创造了大量财富。根据不完全的统计，一九五○年全国十三个城市的职工提出的建议被采用者有二万四千八百七十五件。一九五一年六个大行政区九个月的统计，被采纳的合理化建议达到了十万零八千五百二十八件。一九五○年铁路系统采用各项建议节约的价值为二百三十二亿元；重工业部所属各单位自一九五一年十月至一九五二年九月的一年中，由于采纳职工建议，节约了三千零九十亿元；一九五三年天津市各国营棉纺厂由于采纳建议，为国家增加了三十九亿九千多万元的财富。
    但是，由于过去各地区各产业的奖励标准和计算方法多不一致，奖金来源亦各不相同，又没有专管机构或专管机构不健全，往往就发生价值相近的建议所给奖金悬殊，以及积压群众建议或奖励不及时的现象。这种状况妨碍着群众的发明、技术改进及合理化建议运动的进一步开展。目前，由于国家经济的恢复和有计划建设的开始，要在已经达到的生产水平上进一步提高产量和质量，增加新产品提高劳动生产率与降低成本，克服在建设过程中的新的困难，就必须在推广先进经验与合理化建议的群众运动基础上，开展群众性的技术革新运动，进一步挖掘企业的潜在力量，把劳动生产率提得更高。这就需要进一步有效地发挥广大职工的创造性劳动。在这种情况下，中央人民政府政务院适时地颁布了“有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”，这是一项十分重要的措施。
    无疑的，这一条例的公布，将有力地把群众中蕴藏的智慧激发出来，集中起来，克服建设进程中的困难，更好地去完成国家的计划，加速我国国民经济发展的速度。条例中规定，凡积极协助他人实现建议的工人、工程技术人员和职员，也应给以适当的奖励。这个规定将鼓励所有职工，特别是企业领导人员和工程技术人员大力支持和协助建议者，将大大发挥职工群众集体主义的创造精神，促进工程技术人员和工人的互助合作。条例中还规定了具体的科学的计算方法，保证每一个建议将因其对国家贡献的大小而得到相应的合理的奖励，避免了贡献大奖励少或贡献小奖励多的畸轻畸重现象，以及不论贡献大小，一律采取平均主义的奖励办法。这种严格的计算还可防止虚报成绩、骗取奖金的恶劣行为。
    为了正确地贯彻这一条例，必须纠正对国家奖励政策的某些不正确的看法。有一些企业的管理干部不了解奖励政策的重要性，认为只要进行政治思想工作，提高职工的政治思想觉悟就行了，不必进行物质奖励；实行物质奖励只会助长职工中的经济主义意识。这些人不了解，不仅仅在有高度觉悟的先进分子中间，而且要在千百万普通群众中间鼓舞他们的创造热情，只依靠政治思想工作是不够的，还必须从物质利益上激发人们关心自己的劳动成果。这样做，不仅没有坏处，反而可使广大的劳动群众更加深刻地认识我国社会制度的优越性，认识按劳取酬的社会主义原则，认识国家利益和个人利益的一致，更加增强他们为集体福利而奋斗的思想。
    当然，认为物质奖励是唯一的方法，因而忽视政治工作的巨大作用，也是错误的。如果认为有了这个条例就可以放弃政治工作，单纯以经济利益来刺激工人发明创造，而不教育他们认识发明创造的政治意义，启发和提高他们的社会主义觉悟，那也不能发挥条例的作用，甚至会助长群众中落后意识的发展，使某些职工产生保守、嫉妒、弄虚作假、损人利己等不良思想和行为，使他们看不到工人阶级的远大前途，只计较个人的物质利益。这样就不但不能使创造性的劳动蓬勃地开展起来，而且会削弱工人阶级的战斗力，使国家的建设事业受到损失。我们必须结合奖励条例的实行，教育职工认识国家利益和个人利益的一致性，认识只有在生产不断提高的基础上才能不断改善自己的生活，认识要早日实现社会主义，必须进行创造性的劳动，用革新精神来对待工作。这样才能使国家的奖励政策发挥更大的作用。
    我们也决不能以为，有了政务院发布的这个奖励条例，群众的技术革新运动就会自然地开展起来，而可以不加领导。这种想法是很错误的。奖励条例只能是推动群众创造性劳动的因素之一，而不可能代替对于它的领导。要把群众的智慧和创造精神充分发挥出来，使技术革新运动具有群众性，还必须进行一系列的组织工作和教育工作。必须努力提高企业的管理水平和对劳动竞赛的领导水平，必须加强企业中的技术工作和技术教育，特别是必须向不相信和不重视群众的智慧、堵塞群众创造精神的官僚主义进行不倦的斗争，从各方面为开展合理化建议和技术革新运动创造条件，把劳动竞赛提高一步。只有这样，政务院所颁布的这个奖励条例才能够很好地贯彻并发挥其应有的作用。
    为了回答党和政府对群众创造性劳动的支持和关怀，广大的职工群众应该以更大的热忱参加到技术革新的行列中来，为充分发挥现有生产设备能力，不断提高劳动生产率，不断降低成本，不断提高职工的技术水平而奋斗。企业中行政领导干部和党组织以及工会、青年团的组织，必须正确地运用和贯彻政务院的这一条例，充分发扬群众的创造精神，集中群众的智慧，使之成为完成国家计划的一种动力。
