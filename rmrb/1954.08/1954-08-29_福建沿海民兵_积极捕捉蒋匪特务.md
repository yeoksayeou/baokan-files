    Actively Capture Chiang Kai-shek Bandits and Special Agents
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th - The militiamen in the coastal areas of Fujian Province are actively assisting the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense troops and public security forces in capturing Chiang Kai-shek's special agents who have infiltrated the mainland to carry out sabotage activities. In the past six months, the militiamen of Hujiang Township in Lianjiang County have captured two Chiang Kai-shek special agents, and the militiamen of Daxiaozuo in Hui'an County have cooperated with the public security departments to solve two special agent cases. In July of this year, the militiamen in the coastal areas of Tong'an County assisted the army in annihilating two battalions of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. The militiamen of Xiaodeng in Nan'an County have captured more than 30 Chiang Kai-shek special agents. The militiamen in the coastal areas of Fujian Province are also actively standing guard and keeping watch, assisting the People's Liberation Army troops in consolidating coastal defense and conducting political propaganda to the remaining Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on the islands, and persuading Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers to abandon the dark and turn to the light. The militiamen of Hui'an County once persuaded four Chiang Kai-shek soldiers entrenched on the island to surrender to our army.
