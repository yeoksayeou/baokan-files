    Volunteer Army Units Continue In-Depth Discussions on Draft Constitution

    The organs and units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are continuing to conduct in-depth discussions on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    Cadres and soldiers of the organs and units of the Volunteer Army stationed on the east coast of Korea have listened to three to four reports on the Draft Constitution from early July to mid-August and have seriously conducted seven to ten discussions. When the Sixth Company of a certain unit held group discussions on the provision in the Draft Constitution that "The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people; their task is to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction and defend the security of the country and the completeness of its territorial sovereignty," more than 100 people spoke at the meeting, warmly supporting this provision. During the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution, a certain regiment also held tests, and more than 80% of the company and platoon-level cadres in the regiment achieved excellent scores. Volunteer Army units stationed in the central, western, and western coastal areas of Korea have also conducted many in-depth discussions. During the discussions, cadres and soldiers unanimously expressed their support for the Draft Constitution. They expressed many feelings and insights about the Draft Constitution and offered opinions on modifying and supplementing certain provisions.

    The publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution have greatly enhanced the strong will of the vast numbers of commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army to defend the motherland and peace. The soldiers of the reconnaissance platoon of a certain unit, which has been awarded the collective second-class merit twice, unanimously expressed: We must continue to maintain our honor, carry forward our honor, and vigilantly defend the victorious results of the Korean armistice and defend the security of the motherland. After discussing the Draft Constitution, the soldiers of the Third Squad of a certain unit seriously made a plan to help each other and strive to improve their military skills. A driver of a certain unit's motor vehicle company wrote Article 101 of the Draft Constitution on a large piece of paper and pasted it in the cab. They said: It is the duty of every citizen to cherish and protect public property. We must support the Draft Constitution by ensuring safe driving and conscientiously learning from Lu Yaowen's experience in saving gasoline, cherishing, and conserving the motherland's materials. From June 15th to the end of July, this motor vehicle company saved 20,489 kilograms of gasoline and more than 32.2 million yuan worth of automotive equipment. Ma Long, a driver who has driven 50,000 kilometers safely, has saved more than 400 kilograms of gasoline for the country since the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. He said: "This car was given to me by the people of the motherland. If I don't maintain it well, I will not have fulfilled the duties that a citizen should." After discussing the Draft Constitution, the soldiers of the Sixth Group of the technical company of a certain railway soldier unit of the Volunteer Army, who are helping the Korean people carry out reconstruction work at a certain construction site, launched a heated labor competition with other groups. Since the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, cadres and soldiers of various units have also written letters to their families and relatives, encouraging them to work hard to increase production and actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.

    志愿军各机关部队继续深入讨论宪法草案
    中国人民志愿军各机关各部队继续深入地讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    驻在朝鲜东海岸志愿军各机关、部队的干部和战士，自七月上旬到八月中旬已经先后听过三次到四次关于宪法草案的报告，并认真地进行了七次到十次的讨论。某部第六连在分组讨论宪法草案关于“中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整”的条文时，有一百多人在会上发了言，热烈拥护这一条的规定。某团在宪法草案的宣传和讨论中还举行了测验，全团百分之八十以上的连、排级干部都得到了满分的优良成绩。驻在中线、西线和西海岸的志愿军各部队也都进行了多次深入的讨论。在讨论中，干部和战士们一致表示拥护宪法草案。他们发表了许多对宪法草案的感想、心得，并对某些条文提出了修改和补充的意见。
    宪法草案的宣传和讨论，大大地增强了志愿军广大指挥员、战斗员保卫祖国、保卫和平的坚强意志。某部立了两次集体二等功的侦察排的战士们一致表示：要继续保持荣誉，发扬荣誉，警惕地保卫朝鲜停战胜利的成果，保卫祖国的安全。某部第三班的战士们在讨论了宪法草案后，认真地订了相互帮助，努力提高军事技术的计划。某部汽车连司机把宪法草案第一百零一条写在大纸上，贴在驾驶室里。他们说：爱护和保卫公共财产是每一个公民的义务。我们要以保证安全行车，认真地学习卢耀文节省汽油的经验，爱护和节约祖国的物资来拥护宪法草案。从六月十五日到七月底，这个汽车连节约了两万零四百八十九公斤汽油和价值三千二百二十多万元的汽车器材。安全行车五万公里的司机马龙自宪法草案公布以来，为祖国节省了四百多公斤汽油。他说：“这辆车是祖国人民交给我的，我如保养不好，就是没尽到公民应尽的义务。”在某工地上帮助朝鲜人民进行恢复建设工作的志愿军铁道兵某部技术连第六组的战士们，在讨论宪法草案后和其它各组展开了热烈的劳动竞赛。在宪法草案公布以来，各部队的干部和战士还纷纷写信给自己的家属和亲友，鼓励他们努力提高生产，积极参加祖国的社会主义建设事业。（新华社）
