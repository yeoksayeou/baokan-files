    Zhejiang's local industries are manufacturing one thousand two hundred new-style rice threshers. The advantages of this batch of rice threshers are their simple structure, robust quality, and ease of use. Each rice thresher is also equipped with instructions and simple repair and maintenance tools such as wrenches and oil cans. One rice thresher can be operated by two people, and can thresh up to more than three thousand catties of rice per day. This is one to two times more efficient than manual threshing, and the grain removal is relatively clean. It is estimated that each mu of land can yield five more catties of grain than with manual labor. Now, this type of rice thresher has been successfully trial-produced and is being manufactured by the local state-owned Hangzhou Iron Factory, Processing Iron Factory, and Jiaxing Farm Implement Factory. Before the late rice harvest, batches of new-style rice threshers will be continuously sent to the rural areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, to help farmers with the autumn harvest.

    浙江制造一批新式打稻机
    浙江省的地方工业正在制造一千二百台新式打稻机。这批打稻机的优点是构造简单，质地牢固，使用方便。每台打稻机上并附有说明书和扳头、油壶等简单的修理保养工具。一台打稻机两个人使用，每天最多能打三千多斤谷子，比人力打稻效率高一至两倍，而且脱谷比较干净，估计每亩田可以比人力多打五斤粮食。现在，这种打稻机已经试制成功，正由地方国营杭州铁工厂、加工铁工厂和嘉兴农具厂制造。晚稻收割前，一批批新式打稻机将源源送到杭、嘉、湖地区的农村里，帮助农民秋收。
