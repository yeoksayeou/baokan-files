Wang Xicheng is a master at raising and transporting live pigs. From January 1953, when he joined the Xuchang branch of the China Food Company, to June of this year, he has transported a total of 57 train cars of live pigs. He has transported over 6,000 pigs, with the longest journey being over 4,000 li and the shortest over 900 li. During the transport, not a single pig has died, earning him the title of model worker in the company.

When Wang Xicheng first came to the Xuchang branch, he lacked a strong sense of responsibility towards state property. He was also impatient when looking after the pigs. If a disobedient or strong pig ran around and bit others in the pen, he would beat it severely. Sometimes, when he was in a good mood, he would show off his strength by lifting the pig's hind legs and spinning it around a few times. Later, through the education and help of the leadership, his class consciousness gradually increased, and he changed his past work attitude. He said, "I would rather suffer myself than let the pigs suffer. If a pig dies, the state will suffer a loss!"

After his thinking changed, he was also willing to delve deeper into business matters. He learned the penning and feeding method of pigs from the No. 1 Warehouse of the Livestock Store of the Changchun City Native Produce Company in Northeast China, and combined the wisdom of his fellow workers to raise the pigs in separate pens according to size, health, and weakness, avoiding the past phenomenon of large pigs bullying small ones and strong pigs bullying weak ones in the pens. During transportation, before loading the pigs onto the train, he first carefully inspected each pig after it was weighed. If he found a weak pig, he would immediately pick it out. If it had to be transported, he would remember it and take special care of it on the train. He also provided a certain amount and quality of feed based on the distance and weather conditions, without overfeeding the pigs, to prevent them from bloating and dying on the train. He also paid attention to the cleanliness of the train cars used to transport the pigs. If the cars had been used to transport gasoline or kerosene, he would sweep them clean and then spread a layer of fresh soil. If they had been used to transport lime or coal, he would rinse them with water. This way, the pigs would not smell the odor of kerosene or gasoline in the cars, and no lime or coal dust would get into their eyes or noses. In the summer, when loading the pigs, he also paid attention to nailing the rafters properly and putting up the shed covers as early as possible, and spraying the car sides with cool water to prevent the pigs from feeling hot on the train, reducing the incidence of illness and death due to heat. Within the first hundred li after the train started, the pigs were easily frightened. At this time, he took careful care, especially of the timid pigs, so that they quickly calmed down. He also carefully checked the nets to prevent the pigs from jumping off the train and causing injury or death. After the first hundred li, he constantly paid attention to the pigs' eating, lying down, movement, and stillness, as this was the time when the pigs were most likely to get sick. If he found sick or weak pigs, he would take individual care of them, feeding them more feed or giving them treatment.

    运送活猪的好手王喜成
    刘华珍　王静
    王喜成是饲养毛猪、运送活猪的好手。从他一九五三年一月参加中国食品公司许昌支公司工作，到今年六月这一年半中，共押运了五十七个车皮的活猪，前后共押运过六千多头毛猪，押运旅程最远达四千多里，最近亦有九百多里，但在押运途中从没死过一头猪，因而被评为该公司的模范工作者。
    王喜成初到许昌支公司时，对国家资财的责任心是很差的。对毛猪的看管也不耐心，遇有乖、强猪入圈后乱跑乱咬，他就狠狠地打它一顿；有时高兴了，还恃自己有劲，把猪后腿提起，转它几圈。后来，经过领导上的教育和帮助，阶级觉悟逐步提高，他改变了过去的工作态度。他说：“宁肯自己吃苦，不能叫猪受罪，如果死了一头猪，国家就要受到损失啦！”
    思想转变后，在业务方面也肯深入钻研了。他学习了东北长春市土产公司畜产商店第一仓库的分圈养猪法，并综合了工人同志们的智慧，将入库的活猪按大、小、病、弱分圈饲养，避免了过去猪圈中大压小、强欺弱的现象。在押运时，每逢装车前，他首先把过了磅的毛猪详细检查一遍，发现弱猪，马上挑出，如须运出时，就牢牢记住，以便在车上特别照顾。并根据路途远近、天气冷热给以一定分量和质量的饲料，不使猪吃的过饱，以免在车上涨肚死亡。对装运猪只车厢的清洁也很注意。如装过汽油、煤油的车厢，打扫干净后还要铺上一层新土；装过石灰或煤的，就用水冲刷一遍。这样，猪在车中既闻不到煤油、汽油的臭味，也没有石灰或煤屑扑眼扑鼻。在夏季装车时，他还注意把棚杆钉好，及早搭好棚盖，并把车梆用凉水洒一遍，使猪在车上不致感到炎热，减少毛猪因热生病、死亡情况。开车后百里以内，猪在车上很易惊慌，这时他就小心照顾，特别招呼胆小怕惊的毛猪，使其很快恢复安静，并细心检查网子，以免猪只跳车，发生伤亡事故。过了百里以后，他时刻注意猪的吃、卧、动、静，因为这是猪只最容易生病的时候。如发现病猪、弱猪，就个别照顾，加喂饲料，或给予治疗。
