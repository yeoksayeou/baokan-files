Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit clique's traitorous rule in Taiwan is causing increasingly strong resistance from Taiwanese compatriots. In order to maintain its desperate rule, it is increasingly frantically carrying out bloody suppression of Taiwanese compatriots through special agent surveillance, prisons, concentration camps, torture, and massacres.

The many prisons and concentration camps set up by the Chiang bandit gang in Taiwan and nearby islands are already overcrowded. Chiang's Central Daily News recently admitted: "Taiwan's prisons have been overcrowded with criminals in recent years." Therefore, the Chiang bandits are constantly expanding special agent agencies, prisons, and concentration camps. With American aid, the Chiang bandits recently built a new "Criminal Experiment Building," which contains American-style equipment and instruments of torture for harming the people, such as showrooms, fingerprint rooms, electrical rooms, chemical rooms, and darkrooms. In addition to supplying the pseudo-Taiwan Provincial Police School, which trains Chiang bandit special agents, for "criminal experiment teaching," this torture building will also be directly supplied to all the special agent agencies of the Chiang bandits. On June 17, Yan Jia-gan, chairman of the bandit Taiwan Province, said triumphantly at the building's completion ceremony: In Taiwan, "not only is the police network densely covering all corners of the province," but there is also "scientific equipment" supplied by the United States, which will make it more convenient to harm the people of Taiwan in the future.

In addition to setting up many prisons in various parts of Taiwan, the Chiang bandits also established a large-scale concentration camp on Huoshao Island in southeastern Taiwan by the bandit Taiwan Provincial Security Command. This concentration camp has harmed countless patriotic people and innocent people in recent years. According to a Chiang bandit publication in Hong Kong in June, there are currently 3,678 people imprisoned and tortured in the Huoshao Island concentration camp by the Chiang bandit gang. Most of these people are local Taiwanese, and most of them are young people. Many of them are patriots who actively participated in resisting the American aggressors and the Chiang bandit gang. Some were arrested and implicated by Chiang bandit special agents because their relatives, friends, and classmates participated in patriotic movements. There were also Chiang bandit officers and soldiers who were sent to the concentration camp simply because they were at odds with the special agent "political instructors" in the bandit army. The news revealed the extremely vicious face of the Chiang bandits' persecution of Taiwanese compatriots: Chiang bandit special agents do not need any "evidence." As long as they "judge" who should be arrested, they will be charged with "criminal crimes of rebellion" and "suspects of security" and thrown into concentration camps, and then subjected to mental and physical torture, devastation, and even massacre.

In the Chiang bandit gang's internal strife, some appalling crimes of harming Taiwanese compatriots with special agent terrorist rule have also been exposed. Wu Guozhen, the former bandit governor of Taiwan Province who broke with Chiang and ran to the United States, published an article scolding Chiang in the American "Outlook" magazine on June 29. In this article, he talked about the Chiang bandit's special agent rule and said: "Taiwan has become a police state." Chiang bandit special agents "can often arrest people without asking clearly. They will break into an office, holding a revolver, and ask a panicked person sitting across the table: 'Are you that guy surnamed Wang?' Then they take him away." Li Zongren, the former bandit "Acting President" who was "dismissed" by Chiang bandits, also said in an open letter to Chiang bandits published in the United States in February this year:
"Countless innocent people are arrested in the middle of the night and secretly sent to Green Island near Taiwan (the Chiang bandit gang renamed Huoshao Island as Green Island – editor's note). Since then, their voices have disappeared, and their bones have nowhere to return. How many are there more than a thousand? All the tyrannies, those who talk about it change their color."

However, the Chiang bandit gang's special agent rule and bloody suppression cannot eliminate the Taiwanese compatriots' will to resist, but are arousing more and more people's increasingly strong resistance. The fact that the Chiang bandits have to constantly expand prisons and concentration camps is proof of this.

### 蒋匪卖国集团加紧特务统治和血腥镇压  激起台湾同胞的越来越强烈的反抗

    蒋匪卖国集团加紧特务统治和血腥镇压
    激起台湾同胞的越来越强烈的反抗
    【新华社二十日讯】蒋介石卖国集团在台湾的罪恶统治正引起台湾同胞日益强烈的反抗。为了维持它的日暮途穷的统治，它正日益疯狂地通过特务监视、牢狱、集中营、酷刑和屠杀对台湾同胞进行血腥的镇压。
    蒋匪帮在台湾及附近岛屿上设立的许多监牢和集中营已有人满之患。蒋匪中央日报最近承认：“台湾监所近年人犯拥塞”。因此，蒋匪正不断扩充特务机构、监狱和集中营。在美国的援助下，蒋匪最近又新建了一座“刑事实验大楼”，里面有陈列室、指纹室、电气室、化学室、暗室等残害人民的美式设备和刑具。这座酷刑大楼除了供给培养蒋匪特务的伪台湾省警察学校作“刑事实验教学”之用外，还将直接供给蒋匪所有的特务机关使用。匪台湾省主席严家淦六月十七日在该楼落成典礼上得意地表示：在台湾，“不但警网密布全省各角落”，而且又有了美国供给的“科学化设备”，今后对于残害台湾人民将更为便利。
    蒋匪除了在台湾各地设立了许多监狱之外，还由匪台湾省保安司令部在台湾东南的火烧岛上设立了一个大规模的集中营。这个集中营几年来残害了无数的爱国志士和无辜的人民。据在香港的蒋匪帮刊物在六月间透露，目前被蒋匪帮囚禁在火烧岛集中营中被折磨的还有三千六百七十八人。这些人大部分都是台湾本地人，而且大部分是青年，其中有许多是积极参加反抗美国侵略者和蒋匪帮的活动的爱国者，也有因为自己的亲属、朋友、同学、教师等参加爱国运动而被蒋匪特务株连滥捕的，也有蒋匪军官兵仅仅因为与匪军中的特务“政治教官”不睦而被押到集中营的。消息透露了蒋贼残害台湾同胞的穷凶极恶的面目：蒋匪特务不需要什么“证据”，只要“判断”谁应当被拘捕，谁就会被加上“触犯叛逆刑事罪”和“安全嫌疑犯”的罪名并被投进集中营，然后施以精神上和肉体上的折磨、摧残，以至于屠杀。
    在蒋匪帮的内哄中，也暴露了若干以特务恐怖统治残害台湾同胞的令人发指的罪行。和蒋贼闹翻后跑到美国的前匪台湾省主席吴国桢，在六月二十九日美国“展望”杂志上发表了一篇大骂蒋贼的文章，其中谈到蒋匪的特务统治时说：“台湾已经变成一个警察国家”，蒋匪特务“甚至可以经常不问清楚他们所要逮捕的人，他们会闯入一个办公室，手里拿着左轮，对一个坐在桌子对面的惊惶失措的人问道：‘你是姓王的那个家伙吗？’接着就把他带走了。”被蒋匪“罢免”的前匪帮“代总统”李宗仁今年二月间在美国发表致蒋匪的公开信中也说：
  “不知名之无辜人民，深夜被捕，密送台湾附近之绿岛（蒋匪帮把火烧岛改名为绿岛——编者注），从此形音消沉，骸骨无归者，何止千百？凡兹暴政，谈者色变”。
    但是，蒋匪帮的特务统治和血腥镇压，不但不能消灭台湾同胞的反抗意志，而且正激起更多人的日益强烈的反抗。蒋匪要不断扩充监狱和集中营，这就是明证。
