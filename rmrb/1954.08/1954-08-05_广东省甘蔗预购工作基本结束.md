The sugarcane pre-purchase work in Guangdong Province has basically concluded. As of July 5th, the pre-purchased sugarcane area in the province reached over 311,000 mu, completing 108% of the plan. This sugarcane will basically meet the raw material needs of the five state-owned sugar factories in Shunde, Zini, Dongguan, Shitou, and Jieyang during the 1954-1955 sugar production season. Compared with the previous season, the sugarcane crushing volume of these five state-owned sugar factories will increase by 26.4%, and the sugar production will increase by 62.31 million jin.

The state's pre-purchase of sugarcane in Guangdong this time issued over 44 billion yuan in deposits, which is a great support for sugarcane farmers' production. Sugarcane farmers in Wanqingsha, Zhuhai County, proposed to increase production by 20% this year. The Wu Mei Agricultural Production Cooperative in the 8th District of Shunde County stated that they would strive to increase the average yield of sugarcane per mu from 6,000 jin last year to 9,000 jin. The Cen Guinan Agricultural Production Cooperative stated that they are confident in increasing the yield of sugarcane per mu from 7,500 jin last year to 12,000 jin.

    广东省甘蔗预购工作基本结束
    广东省的甘蔗预购工作已经基本结束。截至七月五日止，全省预购的甘蔗，面积达三十一万一千多亩，完成计划百分之一百零八。这些甘蔗基本上能满足顺德、紫坭、东莞、市头、揭阳等五个国营糖厂在一九五四年到一九五五年榨糖季节的原料需要；和上一榨季比较，这五个国营糖厂的榨蔗量将增加百分之二十六点四，产糖量将增加六千二百三十一万斤。
    国家这次在广东预购甘蔗，发放了四百四十余亿元的定金，对蔗农的生产是很大的支持。珠海县万顷沙蔗农提出今年要增产二成；顺德县第八区吴妹农业生产合作社表示争取将甘蔗的每亩平均产量，由去年的六千斤增加到九千斤；岑桂南农业生产合作社表示有把握使甘蔗的每亩产量，由去年的七千五百斤增加到一万二千斤。
