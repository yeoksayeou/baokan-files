    Various Locations Actively Allocate Grain Seeds and Flood Control Equipment to Support Flood-stricken Areas in Flood Prevention, Drainage, Production and Disaster Relief Efforts
    Grain departments of local people's governments are transferring large quantities of late autumn crop seeds to help farmers in flood-stricken areas of Hubei Province replant late autumn crops. According to incomplete statistics as of early August, 12.19 million jin of buckwheat seeds have been transferred from Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, Shandong, Shanxi, Beijing, Tianjin, Henan and other provinces and cities. In addition to the 6.45 million jin that have already been transported, the remainder are being rushed for transport and are expected to arrive by the end of the month. Grain departments in various locations have demonstrated a high degree of class comradeship in the transfer of grain seeds. In addition to finding ways to overcome various difficulties to complete the planned quotas assigned to them by the central grain department, they also tried to offer the disaster area masses favorable prices.

    On August 2, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative received an urgent telegram from the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters requesting support for flood control equipment such as reed mats and grass bags. The cooperative immediately organized manpower and prepared 210,000 mats and 45,000 grass bags that afternoon. In order to borrow some of the grass bags stored in Anshan City, they sent an urgent telegram to the relevant departments in Anshan City to contact them. The prepared reed mats and grass bags required dozens of train cars for transport, and the railway transport department also actively sought ways to support this. This batch of flood control equipment was transported to Wuhan City that evening.

    After accepting the task of purchasing late autumn crop seeds to support the replanting efforts in the flood-stricken areas of Anhui, Jiangsu, and Hubei provinces, the Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Office quickly organized its forces and launched purchasing operations in ten special districts, including Wendeng, Laiyang, and Jiaozhou. Responsible cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives in various locations personally took charge of this work. In Linyi Special District alone, the joint cooperatives of four counties dispatched 29 cadres at the level of directors and section chiefs to assist in the seed purchasing at the grassroots cooperatives.

    The broad masses of farmers, upon hearing the news that the cooperatives were purchasing seeds to support the flood-stricken areas, actively sold late autumn crop seeds in the spirit of "all farmers under heaven are one family." In Pingdu County, many farmers voluntarily delivered potatoes and other items to the supply and marketing cooperatives, and some even refused to accept payment.

    As of August 6, according to incomplete statistics, the province had purchased more than 12.8 million jin of late autumn crop seeds such as potatoes and carrots, exceeding the original purchase plan; more than 7.6 million jin had already been transported. (Xing Guanwu)

    Sichuan and Guizhou provinces transferred more than 33 million jin of surplus grain to support the flood-stricken areas of Hunan Province. This grain began to be transported from Tongren and Zhenyuan in Guizhou Province and Xiushan and other places in Sichuan Province into Hunan Province in late July. The Director of the Grain Department of Sichuan Provincial People's Government and the Commissioner of the Fuling District Commissioner's Office personally went to the grain distribution locations to direct and supervise the grain transportation work. The Communications Department of the Hunan Provincial People's Government instructed its Transport and Storage Bureau to dispatch 280 trucks to transport this batch of grain. Party committees, government departments, and the broad masses in all relevant areas actively participated in the grain transportation work.

    各地积极调拨粮食种籽和防汛器材
    支援水灾地区防汛排涝生产救灾的斗争
    各地人民政府粮食部门调运大批晚秋作物种籽，帮助湖北省水灾地区的农民补种晚秋作物。截至八月上旬不完全统计，从内蒙古、东北、山东、山西、北京、天津、河南等省市调运的荞麦种籽有一千二百一十九万斤。除已经运到的六百四十五万斤外，其余均在陆续赶运，估计月底以前可以全部运到。各地粮食部门在调运粮食种籽中都发挥了高度的阶级友爱精神。他们除设法克服各种困难以完成中央粮食部分配给自己的计划数字外，在价格上也尽量予灾区群众以照顾。

    山东省合作总社接受了收购晚秋作物种籽，支援安徽、江苏、湖北三省水灾区补种的任务以后，迅速组织力量，在文登、莱阳、胶州等十个专区展开收购工作。各地供销合作社的负责干部都亲自掌握这项工作。临沂专区仅四个县合作社联合社就抽出主任、科长级干部二十九人，到基层合作社协助收购种籽。
    广大农民听到合作社要收购种籽支援水灾区的消息，都本着“天下农民是一家”的精神，积极出卖晚秋作物种籽。平度县就有不少农民主动把马铃薯等送到供销合作社去，有的还不肯要钱。
    到八月六日，根据不完全的统计，全省已经收购马铃薯、胡萝卜等晚秋作物种籽一千二百八十多万斤，超过了原订的收购计划；已经运出去的，有七百六十多万斤。　　（邢冠五）
