Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: The Indonesian Art Troupe held a song and dance evening at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall on the evening of the 29th to entertain workers from various industries in the capital, students from major universities and middle schools, and foreign guests in Beijing. This was the last public performance of the Indonesian Art Troupe in Beijing this time. After that, the art troupe will leave Beijing to visit and perform in various places.

More than 3,000 people attended the evening's event.

Every performance by the art troupe was warmly welcomed by the audience. The venue was repeatedly filled with enthusiastic cheers and thunderous applause. The atmosphere in the venue was even more enthusiastic, especially when the young artists performed "Srikandi—Gandrung and Wot Dance." This is a dance that describes the resolute resistance against the oppressors. It depicts the battle between the hero Srikandi and the demon Gandaruwo. When Srikandi defeated the powerful demon in the battle, a burst of warm and loud applause immediately erupted in the venue to congratulate her victory. The audience was also deeply attracted by the "Mahabharata – Morya Vivaha Dance." This dance depicts the horror of war; it tells people in a beautiful dance form that peace is the most precious thing in the world.

The audience also appreciated with great interest the Indonesian artists' newly created dance "Surinditan Dance," the folk dance "Taya U Gel Dance," the folk instrument "Angklung Music," and the folk song "Aloi Ma Dudu Song" and other wonderful programs. These programs all reflect that the Indonesian people are beautiful, love freedom, love peace, and are brave. Many of the programs performed by the art troupe were often danced and sung again and again amidst the enthusiastic welcome of the audience.

During the intermission, a student from the Beijing Hydraulic Power School enthusiastically presented a commemorative badge and a congratulatory message to Mengadas Natsushin, the head of the art troupe, saying: "Congratulations on the outstanding achievements of the Indonesian Art Troupe."

The evening was filled with a warm, friendly, and joyful atmosphere.

In addition to performances during their stay in Beijing, the art troupe also held gatherings with students of all ethnic groups from the Central Institute for Nationalities on the 25th, and with members of the Inner Mongolia National Song and Dance Troupe and students of the Beijing Dance School on the 27th.

They also repeatedly participated in literary and artistic evenings and receptions held by literary and art circles in the capital for them, and watched many Chinese songs and dances, Peking operas, dramas, acrobatics, and movies.

In addition, they successively visited the Institute of National Music of the Central Conservatory of Music, the Central Institute for Nationalities, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Beijing Film Studio, and other places, visited the construction site of the Western Suburbs Cultural and Educational District, and toured various scenic spots in the capital.

    度尼西亚艺术团
    举行歌舞晚会招待首都工人和学生
    【新华社二十九日讯】印度尼西亚艺术团二十九日晚在中山公园音乐堂举行歌舞晚会，招待首都各业工人和各大、中学校学生及在京的各国外宾。这是印度尼西亚艺术团此次在京最后一次公演。此后，艺术团即将离京去各地作访问演出。
    参加今晚晚会的观众有三千多人。
    艺术团演出的每一个节目，都受到观众最热烈的欢迎。会场一再响起热情的欢呼声和雷动般的掌声。尤其当年轻的艺术家们演出“西里干地——干地和渥舞”时，会场情绪更为热烈。这是一个描述对压迫者进行了坚决反抗的舞蹈，它描述了英雄西里干地和恶魔干地和渥之间的战斗。当西里干地在战斗中打败了强大的恶魔的时候，会场上立即迸发了一阵热烈而响亮的掌声，祝贺她的胜利。观众也深深地为“马罕德拉达萨——莫利亚维瓦安舞”所吸引。这个舞蹈描写了战争是如何的恐怖；它以优美的舞蹈形式告诉了人们：和平在世界上是最宝贵的东西。
    观众并以极大的兴趣欣赏了印度尼西亚艺术家新创作的舞蹈“苏琳丹舞”、民间舞蹈“塔雅·乌·格尔舞”、民间乐器“安格隆音乐”和民歌
  “阿罗依·玛·都都歌”等精采节目。这些节目都反映了印度尼西亚人民是爱美、爱自由、爱和平的，并且是勇敢的。艺术团演出的很多节目，还常常在观众的热情欢迎下，跳了又跳，唱了又唱。
    会中休息时，北京水力发电学校的一个学生热情地把一个纪念章和一首贺词敬献给艺术团团长孟阿达斯·纳苏申；表示：“祝贺印度尼西亚艺术团的卓越成就”。
    晚会充满了热烈、友好和欢乐的空气。
    艺术团在京期间除进行了演出外，并曾在二十五日和中央民族学院各族学生，在二十七日和内蒙古民族歌舞团团员及北京舞蹈学校学生先后举行联欢。
    他们还多次地参加了首都文艺界人士为他们举行的文艺晚会和招待会，观看了中国的很多歌舞、京剧、话剧、杂技和电影等节目。
    此外，他们并先后访问了中央音乐学院民族音乐研究所、中央民族学院、中央美术学院、北京电影制片厂等处，参观了西郊文教区工地，游览了首都各名胜。
