Xinhua News Agency, August 25th - According to Taiwanese newspapers, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is carrying out large-scale layoffs, pushing more Taiwanese compatriots into the ranks of the unemployed. The puppet government announced this year that all levels of institutions should cut staff by one-tenth. The puppet Taiwan Sugar Corporation has already laid off 3,700 people this year, the puppet China Merchants Bureau laid off more than 1,300 people, and the puppet Taiwan Power Company laid off 5,000 people. In fact, these civil servants working for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique have long been impoverished due to meager salaries. The manager of a pawnshop in Taiwan reported to the puppet Kaohsiung City Council on March 5th that civil servants account for the largest number of people pawning their belongings, accounting for 28 percent. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is now laying them off on a large scale, which will undoubtedly put their lives in complete despair.
From some scattered news revealed by Taiwanese newspapers, we can see the tragic situation of the lives of Taiwanese compatriots. In Taipei, many unemployed people are displaced, and the number of people living in shacks along the sidewalks is increasing day by day. Many of them make a living by donating blood, and many women are forced into prostitution. Taiwanese newspapers admit that there are more than 10,000 prostitutes in Taipei City alone, averaging one in every ten adult women. Many families with financial difficulties sell their daughters to others as "adopted daughters," and most of these "adopted daughters" are bullied and abused, and eventually forced into prostitution. As a result of their tragic lives, the number of people dying from lung disease is staggering. The Taiwan bandits admit that there are as many as 160,000 people suffering from lung disease in Taiwan, and more than 11,000 people die from it every year.
Xinhua News Agency, August 25th - The Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits use various means to cruelly exploit Taiwanese farmers, one of which is to use American fertilizer to plunder farmers' grain.
Because the United States monopolizes the source of fertilizer in Taiwan and uses fertilizer to exchange for Taiwan rice at unequal value, the price of fertilizer in Taiwan has soared. From June 1949 to June 1953, the average price of goods in Taiwan increased sixfold, while the price of fertilizer increased tenfold, making it impossible for Taiwanese farmers to buy fertilizer. Now the amount of fertilizer applied to Taiwan's cultivated land is half of what it was in 1938. The Chiang bandits' grain bureau took the opportunity to use the method of "exchanging fertilizer for grain" to plunder farmers' rations for export. They forced farmers to "lend" American fertilizer, stipulating that 30 percent of the fertilizer price must be paid in rice at that time, and 70 percent must be "repaid" in rice after the harvest, and interest is calculated at 10 percent per month.
The example of farmers in Yilan County, Taiwan, clearly shows that "exchanging fertilizer for grain" is a vicious means for the Chiang bandits to dump surplus fertilizer from the United States and exploit Taiwanese farmers with high interest rates. Yilan County suffered a natural disaster last year, and the harvested grain has been exhausted by the Chiang bandits, and farmers can no longer pay the "fertilizer grain." According to statistics, as of June this year, farmers in the county "owed" 960,000 catties of the first phase of "fertilizer grain" last year. At a monthly interest rate of one cent, 130 catties should be added to every 100 catties; "owed" 2.24 million catties of the second phase of "fertilizer grain" last year, and 73 catties should be added to every 100 catties; in total, 3.2 million catties of "fertilizer grain" from last year plus 2,883,200 catties of "interest" must be "repaid" to the bandit grain bureau.

### 台湾同胞的生活处于水深火热之中

    台湾同胞的生活处于水深火热之中
   【新华社二十五日讯】据台湾报纸透露，蒋介石卖国集团正在大批裁员，将更多的台湾同胞推入失业的队伍。伪政府今年宣布各级机构都要裁员十分之一。伪台湾糖业公司今年已裁员三千七百名，伪招商局裁员一千三百多人，伪台湾电力公司裁员五千人。而事实上，这些替蒋介石卖国集团工作的公务人员由于待遇菲薄，早已吃穷当光。台湾某一典当铺经理三月五日在伪高雄市议会报告说，目前典当财物者以公务员为最多，占百分之二十八。蒋介石卖国集团现在将他们大批裁去，无疑将使他们的生活完全处于绝境。
    从台湾报纸透露的一些零星的消息中，可以看出台湾同胞生活悲惨的情形。在台北市，许多失业者流离失所，栖身在人行道旁棚屋内的人数日益增加。他们有许多人以输血为生，而许多妇女则被迫为娼。台湾报纸承认，仅台北市一地就有娼妓一万多人，平均每十名成年妇女中就有一人。许多生活困难的家庭将自己的女儿出卖给人做“养女”，而这些“养女”大部分受到欺凌和虐待，最后被迫为娼。生活悲惨的结果，患肺病而死亡的人为数惊人。台湾匪帮承认台湾患肺病的人有十六万人之多，每年因此死亡的达一万一千多人。
   【新华社二十五日讯】蒋介石残余匪帮使用种种手段残酷剥削台湾农民，其中手段之一就是利用美国肥料来掠夺农民的粮食。
    由于美国垄断了台湾肥料的货源，利用肥料与台湾大米进行不等价交换，台湾肥料价格高涨。从
  一九四九年六月到一九五三年六月期间，台湾物价平均上涨为六倍，而肥料的价格上涨为十倍，使台湾农民无力购买肥料。现在台湾耕地的施肥量比一九三八年减少了一半。蒋匪粮食局趁机用“以肥换谷”的办法来掠夺农民的口粮供给出口，他们强向农民“贷放”美国肥料，规定肥料款价百分之三十要当时缴纳稻谷，百分之七十要在收割后“偿还”稻谷，并按百分之十计算月息。
    台湾宜兰县农民的例子清楚地说明：“以肥换谷”是蒋匪帮替美国倾销剩余肥料和以高利贷剥削台湾农民的毒辣手段。宜兰县去年遭受天灾，歉收的粮食也已被蒋匪帮征敛殆尽，农民无法再缴纳
  “肥料谷”。据统计，到今年六月为止，全县农民“积欠”去年第一期的“肥料谷”九十六万市斤，以月息一分计算，每百斤应加“利息”一百三十斤；“积欠”去年第二期的“肥料谷”二百二十四万市斤，每百斤应加“利息”七十三斤；合计要向匪粮食局“清还”去年“肥料谷”三百二十万市斤，外加“利息”二百八十八万三千二百市斤。
