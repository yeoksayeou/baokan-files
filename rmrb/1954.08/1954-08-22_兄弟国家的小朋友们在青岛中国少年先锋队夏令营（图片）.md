　　On the evening of August 15, the entire camp held a banquet to celebrate the 9th anniversary of the liberation of Korea. At the banquet, the children raised glasses full of soda to congratulate the Korean children.
　　The Chinese New Democratic Youth League Central Committee's Chinese Young Pioneers summer camp is located in Qingdao, a famous and beautiful city in our country. In addition to the 182 Chinese Young Pioneers from all over the country, the summer camp also has little friends from fraternal countries such as North Korea, Vietnam, and Bulgaria. These little guests are warmly welcomed by our country's children. During these days at the summer camp, the children from the four countries have established sincere feelings and become the closest of friends. Everyone is having a pleasant and happy summer vacation. The picture shows Chinese Young Pioneers welcoming little friends from fraternal countries such as North Korea, Vietnam, and Bulgaria into the camp. All photos in this issue of the pictorial are taken by Wang Zhiyuan of this newspaper, unless otherwise credited.
　　The summer camp has groups for biology, dance, embroidery, model boats, etc., and children can freely choose to participate. This is the first test flight of a "destroyer" made by the model boat group.
　　Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, came to the seaside bath to visit the children.
　　Everywhere is full of interesting conversations. Look, Chinese Young Pioneer Gan Shuhua and Vietnamese child Nong Shi Xian are gesturing and talking heart-to-heart next to the Chao Yin Waterfall in Laoshan. Vietnamese August Children's Team member Le Quang Duong is a very respected child. In 1953, he was named the number one young guerrilla fighter in Ha Nam province, Vietnam. He was arrested three times and remained heroically unyielding in the face of the enemy. This is the children listening to him tell the story of the Vietnamese guerrilla war.
　　The children of the summer camp became honored guests of the naval uncles, who accompanied them on a sea trip and had a party with them on the warship.
　　The summer camp has prepared a comfortable life for the children. This is the children from various countries enjoying a hearty lunch in the dining hall.
　　The children from various countries are greatly interested in visiting the scenic Qingdao city. This is them visiting Zhanqiao Pier. It's even more fun for two people to swim in one swimming ring.

    八月十五日晚上，全营举行宴会庆祝朝鲜解放九周年。宴会上孩子们举着满盛汽水的玻璃杯向朝鲜小朋友祝贺。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会举办的中国少年先锋队夏令营，设立在我国著名的风景秀丽的城市——青岛市。参加夏令营的除了来自全国各地的一百八十二位中国少年先锋队队员外，还有朝鲜、越南和保加利亚等兄弟国家的小朋友们，这些小客人，受到我国小朋友们的热烈欢迎。在夏令营的这些日子里，四个国家的小朋友们相互间建立了真挚的感情，成为最亲密的朋友。大家愉快、幸福地过着暑假生活。图为中国少年先锋队队员们迎接朝鲜、越南和保加利亚等兄弟国家的小朋友们入营。本期画刊照片除署名者外均为本报王志渊摄
    夏令营里有生物、舞蹈、刺绣、船模等小组，孩子们可以自由选择参加。这是船模小组的一艘“驱逐舰”作第一次试航。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡克实到海水浴场来看望孩子们。
    到处都是有趣的谈话。你看，中国少年先锋队队员干淑华和越南小朋友农氏苋在崂山潮音瀑布旁边做着手势谈心。越南八月少年儿童队队员黎光养是挺受人尊敬的一位小朋友。他曾在一九五三年被评选为越南河南省第一名少年游击战士。他曾三次被捕，在敌人面前英勇不屈。这是孩子们在听他讲越南游击战争的故事。
    夏令营的孩子们成了海军叔叔的贵宾，海军叔叔陪他们在海上旅行，和他们在军舰上联欢。
    夏令营里为孩子们预备了舒适的生活。这是各国的小朋友在餐厅里用丰盛的午餐。
    各国的小朋友对游览风景优美的青岛市区感到莫大的兴趣。这是他们在游览栈桥。两个人套着一个游泳圈游泳更有趣。
