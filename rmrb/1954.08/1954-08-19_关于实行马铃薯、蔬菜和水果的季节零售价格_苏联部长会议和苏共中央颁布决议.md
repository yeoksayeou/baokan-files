Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 13th (TASS dispatch): The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have issued a resolution on implementing retail prices for potatoes, vegetables, and fruits that vary according to the season, as well as reducing state retail prices for vegetable oil and canned vegetables.

The resolution pointed out that the retail prices of late-maturing potatoes, vegetables, and fruits were previously the same throughout the year, regardless of the sales season or storage costs. This failed to guarantee the collective farms, state farms, and trade organizations that stored these products for winter and spring needs, and sold these products evenly throughout the year, with due material benefits. This weakened the economic influence of state trade on collective farm market prices, and failed to encourage consumers to store potatoes, vegetables, and fruits that required conditional storage for winter use.

In order to make collective farms, state farms, and trade organizations concerned about storing potatoes, vegetables, and fruits for winter and spring needs and selling these products evenly throughout the year, and at the same time to encourage consumers to store these products that require conditional storage for winter use, the USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the CPSU decided to implement new retail prices for potatoes, vegetables, and fruits harvested in 1954 that vary according to the season.

The resolution listed the seasonal prices for potatoes, onions, cabbage, cucumbers, tomatoes, apples, pears, grapes, citrus fruits, bananas, pineapples, watermelons, and melons sold in the second zone. For example, top-quality late-maturing potatoes would sell for 45 kopecks per kilogram from September 20th to November 1st, 60 kopecks per kilogram from November 1st to March 1st of the following year, and 80 kopecks per kilogram after March 1st.

The price of top-quality apples (per kilogram) was set as follows: 3 rubles 90 kopecks before October 15th, 6 rubles from October 15th to December 1st, 6 rubles 50 kopecks from December 1st to February 1st of the following year, and 7 rubles after February 1st.

The seasonal retail prices of potatoes, vegetables, and fruits in other zones were also set to be the same as the prices in the second zone.

The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the CPSU decided to reduce the state retail prices of vegetable oil, canned vegetables, and fresh and frozen green beans by an average of 12.5 percent starting from October 1, 1954, to compensate for the possible losses to residents caused by the implementation of seasonal retail prices for potatoes, vegetables, and fruits.

    关于实行马铃薯、蔬菜和水果的季节零售价格
    苏联部长会议和苏共中央颁布决议
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会颁布了关于按季节不同实行的马铃薯、蔬菜和水果的零售价格以及减低植物油和蔬菜罐头的国家零售价格的决议。
    决议指出，以前晚熟的马铃薯、蔬菜和水果的零售价格是全年一样的，不分销售季节的差异，也不考虑储存的费用，因而不能对那些为冬季和春季需要储存这些产品和全年均匀地销售这些产品的集体农庄、国营农场和贸易机构保证应有的物质利益。这样就削弱了国家贸易对集体农庄市场价格的经济上的影响，同时也不能鼓励那些为着冬季需用有条件储存马铃薯、蔬菜和水果消费者去储存这些产品。
    为了使集体农庄、国营农场和贸易机构关心为冬季和春季需要储存马铃薯、蔬菜和水果和全年均匀地销售这些产品，同时为了鼓励那些为着冬季需用有条件储存这些产品的消费者去储存这些产品，苏联部长会议和苏共中央决定对一九五四年收的马铃薯、蔬菜和水果按季节不同实行新的零售价格。
    决议开列了按季节不同而对第二地带销售马铃薯、葱、甘蓝、黄瓜、番茄、苹果、梨、葡萄、柑橘、香蕉、凤梨、西瓜、甜瓜的价格。如晚熟的上等马铃薯从九月二十日到十一月一日售四十五戈比一公斤，从十一月一日到次年三月一日售六十戈比一公斤，从三月一日以后售八十戈比一公斤。
    上等苹果的价格（按一公斤计）规定为：在十月十五日以前售三卢布九十戈比，从十月十五日到十二月一日售六卢布，从十二月一日到次年二月一日售六卢布五十戈比，从二月一日以后售七卢布。
    其他地带的马铃薯、蔬菜和水果的季节零售价格也规定和第二地带的价格相同。
    苏联部长会议和苏共中央决定从一九五四年十月一日起平均减低植物油、蔬菜罐头和新鲜、冷藏青豆的国家零售价格百分之十二点五，以弥补由于按季节不同实行马铃薯、蔬菜和水果的零售价格而可能引起的居民的损失。
