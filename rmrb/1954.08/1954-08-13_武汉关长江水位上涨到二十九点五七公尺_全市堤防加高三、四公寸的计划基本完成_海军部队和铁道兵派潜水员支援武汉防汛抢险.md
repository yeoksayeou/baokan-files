After the water level rose to 29.56 meters at 3:00 AM on the 12th, it remained stable for eleven hours until 2:00 PM. From 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, it rose another one centimeter. According to reports from various hydrological stations along the Han River at 8:00 AM on the 12th, the Han River's water level from Ankang in southern Shaanxi Province downstream was declining.

At 8:00 AM on the 12th, the water levels of the Yangtze River from Chongqing to Chenglingji were also reported to be falling uniformly.

For more than a month, the Wuhan flood control army of over 100,000, which has been ahead of the flood, has basically completed the plan to universally raise the dikes by another 30-40 centimeters on top of the original reinforced and heightened base by the afternoon of the 12th, and has begun to continue reinforcing them both inside and outside the dikes. Many rescue teams have generally conducted large-scale rescue drills, with very good results.

The Wuhan Municipal Flood Control Committee of the CPC announced today a decision to strengthen the leadership structures at all levels of the Party committee. The Yangtze River Daily announced today the list of 52 collective award-winning units and 127 individuals who have been awarded for meritorious service in the Wuchang District by the Wuhan Municipal Flood Control Headquarters.

The highest indoor temperature in Wuhan today reached 96 degrees Fahrenheit, the hottest day since the beginning of summer this year.

(This newspaper, Wuhan, 12th) The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, Railway Engineering Corps, and Air Force units have been ordered to actively support the flood control and rescue struggle in Wuhan. The first batch of divers dispatched by the Navy troops arrived in Wuhan on the afternoon of the 11th aboard Air Force aircraft. The divers dispatched by the Railway Engineering Corps arrived in Wuhan the day before yesterday. On the evening of their arrival in Wuhan, a team of divers from the Railway Engineering Corps participated in the rescue operation near Wuhan Guanshui. They explored the dangerous situation underwater and filled sacks and steel plates in the places where the danger occurred. They worked continuously for six hours, setting a new record for underwater working time for divers in Wuhan. The Railway Engineering Corps divers were fully mobilized again on the 11th, and participated in the rescue work in places such as Luojiadun and Aijiazui.

    【新华社武汉十二日电】十二日下午五时，武汉关长江水位已到二九点五七公尺，比历年最高水位（一九三一年的二八点二八公尺）高出一点二九公尺。从十二日晨三时水位涨到二九点五六公尺后，到同日下午二时，曾持续十一小时没有上涨，从下午三时到五时又涨了一公分。据汉水沿岸各个水文站十二日上午八时报告，汉水从陕西省南部安康以下沿线水位都在下落，近两天磁盘山、岳口、仙桃等地水位都下降一公尺多。十二日八时，长江从重庆到城陵矶各地水位也一致报落。
    一个多月来，一直走在洪水前面的武汉十多万防汛大军，已在十二日下午基本完成堤防在原来加固加高的基础上再普遍加高三、四公寸的计划，并已开始继续在堤内外加固。许多抢险队伍已普遍进行抢大险的演习，效果很好。
