Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 14th dispatch from TASS: French National Peace Council Chairman Fajon and Council members Vigier and Boullier recently visited Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation attending the Sixth Session of the United Nations in Paris, to express the French people's desire for peace. In receiving the representatives of the French National Peace Council, Vyshinsky emphasized that the U.S.'s aggressive plans have suffered major setbacks in the United Nations. Vyshinsky said: There was originally a core in the United Nations, headed by the United States, that did not want peace, so the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France have always been able to handle problems as they pleased in the United Nations. However, at this session of the United Nations General Assembly, this core has split. Now some people are beginning to resist the U.S.'s war plans, although it is still "resistance on their knees," it is still resistance. This is clearly manifested in the deliberations of the U.S.'s proposal on so-called "collective measures" in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. The purpose of this proposal is actually to force countries that accept the "collective measures" plan to hand over their armed forces to the command of the U.S.'s Eisenhower. However, this U.S. plan met with strong resistance: initially from representatives of Arab countries, and then even Latin American countries such as Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Guatemala, and Ecuador began to resist, while the representatives of India, Indonesia, and Burma resisted even more resolutely. The representatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, of course, firmly opposed these so-called "collective measures." This situation finally forced the U.S. to greatly revise this proposal, and finally to revise it according to the suggestions of Arab and most Asian countries, so that it could not force other countries to participate in U.S. military adventures, and then it could be passed in the Political Committee. The Political Committee also did not pass the report of the so-called Collective Measures Committee. In this way, the adventurous plan of the U.S.-British bloc suffered a complete defeat.

Vyshinsky then pointed out that the achievements of the United Nations General Assembly were largely facilitated by peace fighters from various countries. Fighting for peace in the United Nations requires great strength and firm confidence, so the support of countries around the world, especially the French people, is very important to us. This session of the United Nations General Assembly was held in Paris, which is conducive to us and other delegations fighting for peace to complete our common task, so it is said that the Americans are opposed to holding the next session in Paris.

Fajon spoke to Vyshinsky about the achievements of the French "National Congress for Peace and Disarmament" held last December. Vigier cited a significant fact to illustrate the scale of the French peace movement, saying: Previously, whenever a government crisis occurred, when the president summoned leaders of various political parties to discuss the organization of the government, he was mainly concerned about the attitudes of various political parties and the attitudes of various political parties towards other political parties. However, in this current crisis, the president only asked: What are your views on rearming West Germany and continuing the war in Vietnam? This shows that the French people's struggle for peace and national independence has had a significant impact, making the unanimous attitude of the parliamentary majority on the above two issues no longer exist.

    法国全国和平理事会代表访问苏联代表团
    维辛斯基指出美国在联大大受挫折
    美国所谓“集体措施”计划受到各国强烈反抗
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：法国全国和平理事会主席法奇和理事维热里、布利埃等，最近访问了在巴黎出席联合国第六届大会的苏联代表团团长维辛斯基，向他表达法国人民的和平愿望。维辛斯基在接见法国全国和平理事会的代表时着重指出：美国的侵略计划在联合国内已大受挫折。维辛斯基说：联合国中本来有一个以美国为首的不希望和平的核心，因此美国、英国和法国的统治集团在联合国中一向可以随心所欲地处理问题。但是，在联合国大会这一届会议上，这个核心分裂了。现在有人开始反抗美国的战争计划了，尽管到现在为止还是“跪着的反抗”，但毕竟是反抗。这一点明显地表现在联合国大会政治委员会讨论美国关于所谓“集体措施”的提案的情形上。这个提案的目的，实际上就是硬要那些接受“集体措施”计划的国家把它们的武装部队交给美国的艾森豪威尔去指挥。但是，美国这个计划遇到了强烈的反抗：起初是阿拉伯国家的代表反抗，接着连墨西哥、智利、哥伦比亚、阿根廷、危地马拉和厄瓜多尔等拉丁美洲国家也开始反抗了，而印度、印尼和缅甸的代表就反抗得更加坚决。苏联和各人民民主国家的代表当然是坚决反对这种所谓“集体措施”的。这种情况终于迫使美国把这个提案大加修改，最后还根据阿拉伯和大多数亚洲国家的建议来修改这个提案，使它无法强迫他国参加美国的军事冒险，然后才能够在政治委员会上通过。政治委员会也没有通过所谓集体措施委员会的报告。这样，美英集团的冒险计划就遭到了彻底的失败。
    维辛斯基接着指出：联合国大会所获得的成就，在很大程度上是由各国的和平战士们促成的。在联合国中为和平而斗争，需要很大的力量和坚定的信心，因此，世界各国，尤其是法国人民的支持，对我们是很重要的。联合国大会这届会议是在巴黎举行的，这一点有利于我们和其他为和平而奋斗的代表团完成我们共同的任务，因此，据说美国人反对在巴黎召开下届会议。
    法奇对维辛斯基谈到了去年十二月举行的法国“全国争取和平和裁减军备大会”的成就。维热里则举出一件意义重大的事实，来说明法国和平运动的规模，他说：以前，每逢政府发生危机，总统召见各政党领袖讨论组织政府事宜时，主要是关心各政党的态度和各政党对别的政党的态度。但是，在现在这次危机中，总统只问：你对于重新武装西德和继续在越南进行战争有什么意见？这就表明法国人民为和平和民族独立而进行的斗争已发生了重大影响，使议会多数派对上面两个问题的一致态度已经不再存在了。
