Making Masks for the Volunteer Army Uncles
    First and Third Squads, Second Brigade, Children's Team, Beijing Fifth Girls' Middle School

    The afternoon of December 8th last year was particularly sunny. Sunlight streamed through the windows onto us, each child's face glowing with a rosy light, the red scarf around our necks appearing especially vibrant. We, a group of Children's Team members, happily gathered in a circle, making masks for the Volunteer Army uncles.

    This was a lovely "Team Day." A few days before, the team members had all been thinking about how to make this "Team Day" more meaningful. When the children occasionally encountered Volunteer Army uncles on the street, they carefully examined what they still lacked, guessing what they needed on the battlefield. Gloves? They had them. Socks? They had those too. The children thought of masks, which could both keep out the cold and prevent sand from entering the mouth. If the Volunteer Army uncles wore the masks we made ourselves, they would know that the children of the motherland were supporting them, and they would be especially happy.

    More than a dozen small hands were constantly moving. Liu Tongwen was a girl who had never touched a needle and thread before. At first, her stitches were not even enough. She said: Volunteer Army uncles can overcome difficulties, and I want to learn their spirit. She did not hesitate to take apart the mask she had made and start over, until she sewed it evenly and neatly, then she smiled happily. He Baoling usually did not do a good job of mending socks, but this time she was particularly careful and earnest, and the mask she sewed was excellent. She said, "We want to sew our love for the Volunteer Army uncles into the masks, stitch by stitch."

    Everyone was not only moving their hands, but also thinking. We thought: Let the Volunteer Army uncles wear the masks we made ourselves, kill more American devils, so that victory will come sooner, accelerate the construction of the motherland, so that we can live a better and happier life, just like the Soviet children! Li Yinghui expressed her admiration and love for the Volunteer Army from the bottom of her heart, she said:

    "How glorious it would be if I were a Volunteer Army soldier, with so many people supporting me and thinking of me so thoughtfully." Another team member said, "We are not Volunteer Army soldiers now, but we must study hard and exercise diligently, preparing for the uncles to return victoriously, so that we can build a new China faster and build it into a big garden, how wonderful!"

    Thinking and saying this, everyone couldn't help but grin and laugh. After a burst of laughter, everyone sang aloud. "Valiantly and spiritedly..." This majestic song filled every corner of the classroom. We had never been so happy before.

    The sun was setting, and only then did everyone reluctantly return home. For some reason, Wang Fengqin was still smiling in her dreams; He Baoling dreamed that the mask she made had been sent to Volunteer Army Uncle Guo Zhongtian, who shook her hand tightly and said: "The happiness of the children will never be destroyed by American imperialism!"

    给志愿军叔叔做口罩
    北京市立第五女子中学校少年儿童队第二大队二中队一、三小队
    去年十二月八日的下午，天气格外晴朗。阳光透过窗户照射在我们的身上，每个小朋友的面庞上呈现出绯红的光彩，脖子里的红领巾显得分外鲜艳。我们一群少年儿童队队员们，快乐地围成一圈，在给志愿军叔叔做口罩。
    这是一个可爱的“队日”。几天前，队员们都在酝酿着怎样把这个“队日”过得更有意义些。小朋友们偶尔在街头上碰到了志愿军叔叔，都细心地打量着他们身上还缺少什么，猜想着他们在战场上需要什么。手套吗？有了。袜子吗？也有了。小朋友们想到又能御寒又能防止风沙入口的口罩，让志愿军叔叔戴上我们亲手做出来的口罩，志愿军叔叔知道祖国的孩子们都在支援他们，他们一定会特别高兴的。
    十多双小手都在不停地动着。刘铜文是一个没有摸过针线的女孩子，开始她缝得不够均匀，她说：志愿军叔叔都能克服困难，我要学习他们的精神。她毫不犹豫地把做好的口罩拆掉，重新开头，直到把它缝得又均匀又整齐，才快乐地笑了。何宝铃平常补袜子，做得不好，因为这次格外仔细认真，她缝的口罩顶棒。她说：“我们要把对志愿军叔叔的热爱，一针一针地缝到口罩上。”
    大家不但手在动，思想也在动啊。我们想：让志愿军叔叔们戴上我们亲手作的口罩，多杀美国鬼子，使胜利早日到来，加速建设祖国，使我们生活得更美好更幸福，像苏联小朋友那样多好啊！李颖慧从心眼里发出了对志愿军的羡慕和热爱，她说：
    “我要是一个志愿军多光荣，这么多的人都在支援着我，而且还想得这样周到。”另一个队员说：“现在咱们没当志愿军，咱们要好好学习，努力锻炼身体，准备着叔叔们胜利回来，我们好更快地建设新中国，把她建设成一个大花园，多好呀！”
    这样想着说着，大家都不由得咧着嘴笑起来，一阵欢笑过去了，大家又高声唱起来。“雄纠纠，气昂昂……”这支雄壮的歌声，充满教室里每一个角落。我们的心里从来没有这样高兴过。
    太阳偏西了，这时大家才恋恋不舍地回到家里。不知怎么回事，王凤琴睡入梦中还在笑；何宝铃梦到自己做的口罩已送给了志愿军叔叔郭忠田，他紧紧地握着她的手说：“孩子们的幸福，绝不让美帝国主义来破坏！”（少年儿童队员王凤琴执笔）
