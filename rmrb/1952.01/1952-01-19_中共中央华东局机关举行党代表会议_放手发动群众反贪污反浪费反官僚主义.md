    The CPC Central Committee East China Bureau's organ held a Party Representative Conference, which played a mobilizing and demonstrative role in how to vigorously and thoroughly carry out a mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy within the organs, and to unleash the masses in a guided manner. It also powerfully promoted the development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the East China level organs.

    Participating in this conference were 196 party member representatives from 38 CPC branches of the CPC Central Committee East China Bureau organs, East China level people's organizations, and Jiefang Daily, Xinhua News Agency East China Branch, and Labor Daily, among others. In addition, 44 party members, 47 Communist Youth League members, and 9 non-Party activists attended as observers. At the beginning of the conference, Rao Shushi, Secretary of the CPC Central Committee East China Bureau, came to give instructions. He repeatedly explained to all representatives the great significance of this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, emphasizing the ideological boundaries between the proletariat's selflessness and the bourgeoisie's selfishness. He severely criticized the shameful behavior of those who pursue personal enjoyment, disregard the overall social production conditions and the living standards of the working people, and engage in extravagance and waste, even to the point of corruption and theft of people's property. He called on the representatives to bravely throw themselves into this great battle between proletarian and bourgeois ideology with a spirit of responsibility to the Party and the people, and to launch a fierce attack on corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, so that this conference would not only be a mobilization conference for battle but also a conference for universal review and exposure. He repeatedly expressed the East China Bureau's determination to fully support this struggle. Wei Wenbo, Secretary-General of the East China Bureau, and Wu Zhongchao, Deputy Secretary-General, respectively conducted self-criticisms regarding the preliminary corruption and waste found in the entire organ and their own ideological style.

    The spearhead of the Party Representative Conference's struggle first focused on the widespread extravagance and waste. Many serious instances of extravagance and waste in various units were exposed one by one, such as damaging the supply system, blindly constructing and leasing houses, arbitrarily increasing personnel, adding equipment, and excessive spending on meeting receptions, banquets, and gifts. Then, the focus shifted to exposing corruption and investigating bribery. Many representatives sharply criticized the wasteful behavior of certain responsible cadres at the meeting, the most prominent of which was the criticism of Zhao Yuhua, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions East China Office and Deputy Director of the Labor Department of the East China Military and Political Committee. After entering Shanghai, Zhao Yuhua pursued personal enjoyment and lived extravagantly. For example, he was not satisfied with having one car and misappropriated 130 million yuan from the East China Trade Union Cadre School to buy another "Buick" car equipped with heating, air conditioning, and a radio; he moved to better houses even when he already had good ones; he was usually arrogant and did not humbly accept criticism. At the beginning of this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he still adopted a passive attitude. After the representatives of the CPC branches of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions East China Office and other organs exposed these facts at the meeting, all the representatives were extremely indignant and unanimously demanded that Zhao Yuhua come to the Party Representative Conference to make a self-criticism. This request was immediately approved and supported by the East China Bureau. On January 9, Zhao Yuhua made a profound self-criticism at the Party Representative Conference. The representatives launched a discussion on his self-criticism and conducted repeated reviews, making severe criticisms of his extravagant and wasteful style. In addition to expressing sincere acceptance of criticism, Zhao Yuhua also assured the conference that he would correct his mistakes. Through the discussion of this typical case, Zhao Yuhua was profoundly educated, and all the representatives were also educated, making everyone further realize the harmfulness of the bourgeois reactionary ideological erosion, thereby further strengthening their determination to struggle.

    This Party Representative Conference is closely linked to and mutually promotes the activities of the various branches. After the Party Representative Conference adjourned each day, the representative groups went separately to convey and organize discussions with the party members of their respective branches, and used blackboard bulletins and cafeteria broadcasts to spread the spirit of the conference more widely among the masses. In addition to maintaining close contact with the heads of the representative groups, the Presidium of the conference also set up an opinion box for the Party Representative Conference in various organs to collect mass opinions at any time. If any suppression of criticism or refusal to conduct self-criticism was discovered, or if the unit had problems that could not be solved, they could be submitted to the Presidium for attention and resolution. Important matters were submitted to the Representative Conference for discussion and resolution by the Presidium.

    This Party Representative Conference will not close until the end of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. During the entire movement, large meetings will be held when there are problems, and temporary recesses will be held when there are no problems, so that the representatives can return to their units to lead the struggle in various units through the branch and collect materials. This approach, on the one hand, powerfully promoted the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle in various units, and on the other hand, after the struggle in various units was deepened, it in turn strengthened the momentum of the Party Representative Conference's struggle, thus achieving great results.

    中共中央华东局机关举行党代表会议
    放手发动群众反贪污反浪费反官僚主义
    从一月五日开始的中共中央华东局机关党代表会议，对于如何在机关内部大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地进行群众性的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争，有领导地放手发动群众，起了动员和示范的作用，并有力地推动了华东一级各机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的开展。
    参加这次会议的有中共中央华东局机关和华东一级人民团体以及解放日报社、新华社华东总分社、劳动报社等三十八个中共支部的党员代表一百九十六人，另有党员四十四人、青年团员四十七人和非党积极分子九人列席。会议开始时，中共中央华东局书记饶漱石曾到会指示。他向全体代表反复阐明这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的伟大意义，着重指出无产阶级的大公无私和资产阶级自私自利的思想界限，严肃地批判了那些不顾整个社会生产条件与劳动人民生活水平而追求个人享受，以致铺张浪费甚至贪污、盗窃人民财产的可耻行为。他号召代表们以对党对人民负责的精神，勇敢地投入这一场无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想的大战斗中，向贪污、浪费、官僚主义展开猛烈的进攻，使这次会议不仅成为一个战斗的动员会议，而且要成为一个普遍检讨、检举的会议。他再三表示了华东局全力支持这个斗争的决心。华东局秘书长魏文伯、副秘书长吴仲超则分别就全机关中初步检查出来的贪污、浪费情况，以及对他们本人的思想作风，首先进行了自我检讨。
    党代表会议斗争的锋芒，首先集中于普遍存在的铺张浪费方面。各单位中许多破坏供给制度、盲目修建与租赁房屋、随便增加人员、添置设备以及会议招待、请客送礼等等严重的铺张浪费现象，都被逐一揭发。然后转向检举贪污、调查受贿等方面。不少代表在会上对某些负责干部的浪费现象进行了尖锐的批评，其中比较突出的是对中华全国总工会华东办事处副主任、华东军政委员会劳动部副部长赵毓华的批评。赵毓华在进入上海之后，为追求个人享受，生活上铺张浪费，例如他有一部汽车还嫌不好，又挪用华东工会干部学校的经费一亿三千万元另买一部有暖气、冷气及收音机设备的“别克”汽车；有好的房子还要搬更好的房子；平时自高自大，不虚心接受别人批评，在此次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，仍采取消极态度。中华全国总工会华东办事处等机关的中共支部代表在会上揭发了这些事实后，全体代表极为愤慨，一致要求赵毓华到党代表会议上来进行检讨，这一要求立即得到华东局的批准和支持。一月九日，赵毓华到党代表会议上作了沉痛的检讨。代表们对他的检讨展开了讨论，并进行了反复的审查，对他的铺张浪费作风提出严厉的批评。赵毓华除表示诚恳接受批评外，并向会议保证改正错误。通过这次典型事例的讨论，深刻地教育了赵毓华，同时也教育了全体代表，使大家进一步认识到资产阶级反动思想侵蚀的危害性，从而更加坚定了斗争的决心。
    这次党代表会议是与各支部的活动密切结合、互相推动的。每天党代表会议散会之后，各代表组即分头向本支部的党员进行传达和组织讨论，并利用黑板报和饭厅广播，把会议精神更广泛地传布到群众中去。会议主席团除与各代表组组长经常保持密切联系外，并在各机关中专设党代表会议意见箱，随时搜集群众意见。如果发现有压制批评、拒绝检讨的现象，或者本单位有不能解决的问题，都可以提交主席团注意解决，重要者由主席团提交代表会议讨论解决。
    这次党代表会议要到反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动结束后始行闭幕。在整个运动期间，有问题时就举行大会，无问题时就暂行休会，使各代表能返回各单位通过支部领导各单位展开斗争，并收集材料。这样做法，一方面有力地推动了各单位的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，另一方面，各单位的斗争深入开展起来以后，又反过来壮大了党代表会议的斗争声势，因此收效极大。（新华社）
