Comrades! At such a struggle meeting today, I share the same feelings as everyone else. I feel extreme indignation and hatred towards the major embezzlers Song Degui, Liu Yuze, the profiteer Zhao Xiqiao, and other criminals who have stolen a large amount of state property! People like Song Degui and Liu Yuze, although they were once revolutionary cadres and even Communist Party members, have completely degenerated to the point of being beyond redemption, going down the same path as the profiteers. They colluded with profiteers, stealing large amounts of state and people's property, disregarding the interests of the state and the people at all costs. Everyone's speeches just now were very good, and the facts that everyone exposed and accused are absolutely true. Song Degui and others have completely become traitors to the Communist Party, traitors to the country, and traitors to the people. Moreover, they are not ordinary traitors; they are traitors with serious crimes who have harmed the interests of the state and the people to the most serious extent. Comrades have demanded that they be expelled from the Party, which is no longer a question. They have already been expelled. Can our proletarian ranks still allow such traitors? If we allowed them, what would become of us! We must not only expel them, but also punish them according to the law. The demands of the comrades are just and reasonable, and we demand that they be immediately sent to the People's Court for the most severe punishment.

From the fact that the profiteer Zhao Xiqiao colluded with Song Degui, Liu Yuze, and others to steal a large amount of state property, we can see how rampant the bourgeoisie's offensive against us is. The sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie, as pointed out by Chairman Mao at the Second Plenary Session of our Party, have indeed penetrated our Party and our Ministry of Public Security. Some people were revolutionary in the past, and perhaps were even heroes, but they were defeated in the face of sugar-coated bullets, and some were injured. Eighty percent of the people in the Administrative Department of our Ministry of Public Security are unclean (of course, none are as serious as Song Degui, etc.). Under the attack of sugar-coated bullets, they lost their ability to resist. People like Song Degui, Liu Yuze, Xiao Shunhe, etc., were completely destroyed in front of the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets! Therefore, we can no longer fail to be vigilant, and we can no longer fail to follow Chairman Mao's instructions to be vigilant against the bourgeoisie's reactionary offensive. We must beat down and suppress this reactionary offensive of the bourgeoisie! We must demand that the profiteer Zhao Xiqiao be punished and that all the state property stolen by Zhao Xiqiao be recovered. Such criminal behavior of profiteers cannot be allowed in a new democratic society under the People's Government. We demand that the People's Court immediately punish him!

Comrades! We must not tolerate the criminal behavior of Song Degui, Liu Yuze, and Zhao Xiqiao. If we tolerate these crimes, we will be in trouble. From an economic point of view, as Comrade Bo Yibo said in his report "Strive for a Thorough and Universal Campaign Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy," if we tolerate them, our country will never be industrialized, let alone think about the socialist future. From a political point of view, if we tolerate them, the Communist Party will be in danger of being corrupted. What if there were many Communist Party members like Song Degui in our ranks? If that were the case, we would be in danger of losing the Party. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. If the Communist Party were to perish, we would be in danger of losing the country! Therefore, we must demand that the government treat them with the most resolute and severe attitude! If we are kind to them, it would be extreme cruelty to the people! Song Degui and Liu Yuze have completely degenerated and deteriorated. Their activities in collusion with the profiteer Zhao Xiqiao are heinous counter-revolutionary activities. In a certain sense, their harm to the state and the people is even greater than that of some counter-revolutionaries. We cannot be kind to counter-revolutionaries. In order to safeguard the interests of the state and the people, we must not be kind to them.

Our Ministry of Public Security has been engaged in a fierce battle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy for the past half month under the supervision and guidance of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Today, it can be said that some major battles have been resolved, but not completely. Therefore, comrades must unite, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, continue to work hard, and strive for a complete resolution of all battles. All corruption is shameful and illegal. We must continue to work hard to thoroughly investigate all large, medium, and small cases of corruption in the Ministry of Public Security. We will never stop until they are all thoroughly investigated! All waste is also shameful, and serious waste is also illegal. We have already made some revelations in this regard, but it is not enough. We must thoroughly investigate all large, medium, and small cases of waste. We will never stop until they are all thoroughly investigated! All bureaucracy is also shameful, and serious bureaucracy should also be subject to legal and disciplinary sanctions. We must resolutely oppose bureaucracy!

How should we deal with those guilty of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy? Should we educate and reform them, impose administrative sanctions, or impose legal sanctions? Comrade Bo Yibo's report has made it very clear, and I also spoke about it at the last meeting of all staff. The principle of handling the situation depends on the severity, magnitude, and extent of the problem, as well as the degree of honesty and awareness. Major embezzlers Song Degui and Liu Yuze must be severely punished. Minor corruption is also shameful and illegal, but if they confess and become aware of their mistakes, we should pull them out of the water. If they are truly aware and confess thoroughly, they may not be punished; but if they commit the same offense again, the punishment will be heavier. Like Sun Zhiwei, who spoke at today's meeting, he was a minor embezzler dragged down by Song Degui. If it is found that the circumstances are indeed not serious, the confession is thorough, and there is a real change, we may not punish him. Waste and bureaucracy should also be analyzed according to the circumstances and dealt with appropriately. Like Comrade Liu Fuzhi, who spoke at today's meeting, he was the direct leader of the Administrative Department and committed serious and egregious bureaucratic errors, and should be punished. Of course, his reflection is very profound, and he has made a serious self-criticism, and there are some objective reasons for his mistakes. However, we still need to deal with him appropriately. I am the person in charge of the Ministry of Public Security, and of course I have a serious responsibility for so many problems in the Ministry of Public Security. I have already made a review at the last meeting of all staff. Speaking of this, I feel very heavy-hearted. The Party and the people trusted me and entrusted me with the responsibility of such an important department. The bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets exploded in our Ministry of Public Security, destroying people and hurting people. In the past, I was almost completely unaware. This incident has had a great shock to me. In the past, I could say that I had no vigilance against the bourgeoisie's offensive. Even if I had some vigilance, it didn't count because it didn't solve the problem. In the future, I am determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, correct my mistakes, and ask everyone to supervise and criticize me.

In this movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, we must, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, make every responsible cadre conduct a sincere, profound, and not perfunctory or reluctant self-criticism in front of the masses, and listen to the criticisms of all comrades. We must boldly promote democracy and mobilize the masses. Those who do not boldly promote democracy and mobilize the masses will be given the punishment of dismissal in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. Because such people are either not clean or have serious bureaucracy. Everyone must see clearly such people and fire at them first. Now, some cadres above the section chief level have made self-examinations, and some have not; some have done well, and some have not done well. Today, it is announced again that all those who have not done so must do so, and not doing so is resisting the Central Committee's policy; those who have not done well are asked to reflect again; all those who do not do so or are perfunctory will be punished. Today, with Chairman Mao supporting us, what is there to be afraid of! Could it be that a few bureaucratic or corrupt elements can scare people? We must boldly criticize and boldly expose all corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

Comrades! We must carry out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy vigorously and thoroughly to the end. We must thoroughly investigate all corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. We must wash away all the filth left over from the old society, no matter where this filth is, on whom it is, and we will not stop until it is cleaned up!

Comrades! Let people like Song Degui and Liu Yuze go down the same path as the profiteers! Let these people who are willing to destroy themselves destroy themselves! They take their own path of destruction, and we take our own path of victory. We firmly believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will definitely be able to wash away all the filth brought about by the old society, eliminate the corruption and influence of the bourgeoisie on us, and defeat the reactionary offensive launched by the bourgeoisie against us. We firmly believe that we will definitely be able to build an industrialized New China! Let us all unite and, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, move towards an industrialized New China! Move towards the future of socialism and communism!

    罗瑞卿部长一月十六日在中央公安部反对大贪污犯宋德贵等的斗争大会上的讲话摘要
    同志们！在今天这样一个斗争大会上，我同大家的心情一样，对于大贪污分子宋德贵、刘玉泽，奸商赵溪桥等大量盗窃国家财产的罪犯，感到极端的愤慨，极端的憎恨！像宋德贵、刘玉泽这样的人，他们虽然曾经是革命干部，并且都曾经是共产党员，但是他们已经完全堕落到不可救药的地步，同奸商走上一条道路上去了。他们和奸商勾结在一起，大量地盗窃国家和人民的财产，不顾一切地破坏国家和人民的利益。刚才大家的发言很好，大家所揭发和控告的事实是千真万确的。宋德贵等人已经完全成为共产党的叛徒，国家的叛徒，人民的叛徒，而且还不是一个普通的叛徒，他们是有严重罪恶、损害国家和人民利益到了最严重程度的叛徒。同志们要求开除他们的党籍，这已不成问题了，而且早已经开除了。我们无产阶级队伍里还能允许这样的叛徒吗？如果允许了他们那还得了！我们不仅要开除他们，而且要依法惩办他们。同志们的要求是正义的、合理的，我们要求立即把他们送到人民法院，予以最严厉的惩办。
    从奸商赵溪桥勾结宋德贵、刘玉泽等大量盗窃国家财产的事实中，我们可以看到资产阶级向我们所举行的进攻是如何猖狂。毛主席在我们党的二中全会上所指出的资产阶级的糖衣炮弹，确确实实是打进我们党内来了，也打进我们公安部内部来了。有些人过去是革命的，也许还曾经是英雄，但他们在糖衣炮弹面前打了败仗，有些人受了伤。我们公安部的行政处有百分之八十的人是不干净的（当然都不像宋德贵等那样严重），他们在糖衣炮弹的攻击下，失去了抵抗能力。像宋德贵、刘玉泽、萧顺和等，更是在资产阶级糖衣炮弹前面毁灭了！因此，我们再也不能不警惕了，再也不能不遵照毛主席的指示对资产阶级的反动进攻提高警惕了，我们要把资产阶级的这种反动进攻打下去，压下去！我们必须要求惩办奸商赵溪桥，要求追回赵溪桥盗窃国家的全部财产。这种奸商的犯罪行为在新民主主义社会里，在人民政府下，是不能允许的，我们要求人民法院立刻惩办他！
    同志们！我们对宋德贵、刘玉泽、赵溪桥的犯罪行为决不能容忍，如果容忍了这些罪行，我们就不得了。从经济上看，正如薄一波同志在“为深入地普遍地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动而斗争”的报告中所说的，容忍了他们，我们的国家就永远不能工业化，更不要想社会主义前途了。从政治上看，容忍了他们，共产党就有被腐蚀的危险。我们内部如果有很多像宋德贵等这样的共产党员，还得了吗？如果这样，我们就有亡党的危险。没有了共产党，也就没有新中国。要是共产党亡掉了，我们就有亡国的危险！因此我们必须要求政府用最坚决最严厉的态度对待他们！如果对他们仁慈了，就是对人民极大的残忍！宋德贵、刘玉泽是完全堕落蜕化了。他们与奸商赵溪桥互相勾结所进行的活动是罪恶的反革命活动。就一定意义上说，他们对于国家和人民的危害，比之某些反革命分子还要大得多。我们对反革命是不能讲仁慈的。我们为了维护国家和人民的利益，就决不能对他们讲仁慈。
    我们公安部最近半个月以来，在中央和毛主席的督促和指示下，对于反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义已经进行了一场激烈的战斗。今天可以说，有些主要战斗已经解决了，但是还没有完全解决。因此，同志们要团结起来，在毛主席的领导下，继续努力，必须求得全部战斗的彻底解决。一切贪污都是可耻的，都是犯法的，必须继续努力，把公安部所有大、中、小贪污彻底追查干净，不追查干净就决不停止！一切浪费也是可耻的，严重的浪费也是犯法的，在这方面我们已经有了些揭发，但还不够，必须把大、中、小浪费彻底追查干净，不追查干净就决不停止！一切官僚主义也都是可耻的，严重的官僚主义也要受到法纪的制裁，我们必须坚决反对官僚主义！
    对于贪污、浪费、官僚主义分子应该怎么处理呢？是教育改造、行政处分，还是法律制裁呢？薄一波同志的报告已经说得很清楚，我在上次全体工作人员大会上也已经讲过了，处理的原则要看问题的轻、重、大、小及坦白和觉悟的程度如何来决定。大贪污犯宋德贵、刘玉泽一定要受到严厉的惩办。小贪污也是可耻的、犯法的，但是如果他坦白了，觉悟了，我们就要把他从水里捞出来。确实觉悟，坦白彻底的，还可以不予处分；但如果再犯，就要加重处罚。像在今天大会上发言的孙志伟，就是被宋德贵拖下水去的一个小贪污分子，如果查清确实情节不重，坦白彻底，确有转变，我们就可以不处分他。对于浪费和官僚主义也要根据情况，加以分析，给以适当处理。像今天在大会上发言的刘复之同志，他是直接领导行政处的，犯了严重的、恶劣的官僚主义的错误，应该受到处分。当然，他的反省很深刻，作了认真的自我检讨，而且他的错误的造成还有一些客观原因，但是，我们仍然要加以适当的处理。我是公安部的负责人，公安部发生了这样许多问题，当然我是要负严重责任的，我已经在上一次全体工作人员大会上做了检讨。说到这里，我心里很沉重，党和人民信任我，把这样一个重要部门交给我负责，资产阶级的糖衣炮弹在我们公安部爆炸了，毁灭了人，伤害了人，我过去差不多毫无觉察。这次事件对我有很大震动，过去对资产阶级的进攻可以说毫无警惕，即使有些警惕，也不算数，因为没有解决问题。今后，我有决心，遵照毛主席的指示，改正我的错误，并要求大家督促、批评。
    在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动中，我们一定要按照毛主席的指示，使每一个负责干部都在群众面前进行诚恳的深刻的不是敷衍的勉强的自我检讨，听取所有同志的批评。必须放手发扬民主，发动群众。那一个不放手发扬民主，不发动群众的，就按毛主席的指示给予撤职处分。因为这样的人不是手上不干净就是有严重的官僚主义。大家要看清这种人，首先向他们开火。现在科长以上的干部，有的做了自我检查，有的还没有做；有的做得好，有的做得不好。今天再次宣布，凡是没有做的都必须做，不做就是抵抗中央的方针；没有做好的就要求他再次反省；凡是不做或敷衍的都要受到处分。今天有毛主席给我们撑腰，还怕什么！难道几个官僚主义分子或者贪污分子还能吓倒人吗？我们一定要放手批评、放手揭发一切贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象。
    同志们！我们一定要把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地进行到底，一定要把所有的贪污、浪费、官僚主义都追查干净，一定要把旧社会遗留下来的污毒都洗干净，不管这些污毒在什么地方，在什么人身上，不搞干净就不停止！
    同志们！让宋德贵、刘玉泽这种人走到和奸商同一条道路上去吧！让这些自甘毁灭的人去毁灭自己吧！他们走他们自己毁灭的道路，我们走我们自己胜利的道路。我们坚决相信在毛主席的领导下，我们一定能够洗清旧社会带来的一切污毒，肃清资产阶级对我们的腐蚀和影响，打败资产阶级向我们举行的反动进攻。我们坚信我们一定能够建设一个工业化的新中国！我们大家团结起来，在毛主席领导下，向工业化的新中国迈进！向社会主义、共产主义的前途迈进！
