    A Grafting Element Actually Received "Escape Money"
    ——A Typical Case of Bureaucracy in the East China Industrial Department
  　Wang Jian
    Sun Xianglong, a clerk in the Transportation Group of the Management Office of the East China Industrial Department, stole and sold ten boxes of files, causing a loss of 60 million yuan to state property. However, Sun Xianglong even received 12 million yuan of "escape money" in a dignified manner and absconded safely. Why was Sun Xianglong, this criminal who stole state property, able to steal state property so freely and escape so easily? In a word: There is a serious bureaucratic work style within our organization.
    In July 1949, less than two months after the liberation of Shanghai, when various organizations applied to the Military Control Commission's Materials Management Office for materials, they were obtained by the Materials Management Office issuing material allocation vouchers. The Materials Management Office issued a material voucher to the East China Industrial Department (then the Heavy Industry Department of the Military Control Commission), which included one box of laboratory chemicals, one box of electrical instruments, one box of radio switches, ten boxes of large files, one box of silicon blocks, and one box of thermometers. The Management Office of the East China Industrial Department sent Sun Xianglong to the "Mitsubishi" warehouse under the Materials Management Office to collect these six items. According to regulations, after collection, the material issuance situation must be signed on the triplicate form, and the second copy should be returned to the requisitioning organization for settlement. When the "Mitsubishi" warehouse issued the materials, it did not specify the actual quantity issued for the large files on the second copy, probably thinking that the first and third copies were already filled, and that this could "serve as proof." Little did they know that this "loophole" was exploited by Sun Xianglong. After Sun returned with the materials, he drew a line on the second copy (indicating that it was not received) and reported to his superiors: "The large files were not received because the warehouse had no stock." In this way, ten boxes of files worth 60 million yuan were safely stolen and sold by the thief.
    On January 25, 1950 (more than five months after Sun Xianglong's theft and sale of files, and the Materials Management Office had also been renamed the East China Branch of the National Warehouse Materials Allocation Committee), the East China Branch of the National Warehouse Materials Allocation Committee issued an invoice after the material was received and sent it to the Industrial Department for settlement. This invoice went through the verification of the statistics, finance, and warehousing groups, and it took nearly seven months, until August 17, for the warehousing group to verify that "these files were indeed not received." Because they were not received, they thought that the invoice issued by the East China Branch of the National Warehouse Materials Allocation Committee did not match the "facts," and they wrote to the East China Branch of the National Warehouse Materials Allocation Committee to "correct" it. When the East China Branch of the National Warehouse Materials Allocation Committee wrote back stating that the files had indeed been "received with the seal of Sun Xianglong from your department," the warehousing group forwarded the letter to the transportation group. The head of the transportation group "as usual" handed this letter to the business department to "investigate," and the business department, also "as usual," handed it to Sun Xianglong himself to "reply." This was undoubtedly sending a letter to the grafter. So, Sun Xianglong locked the letter in his drawer, looking for an opportunity to escape.
    Nearly two more months passed. During this period, Sun Xianglong could not "reply," and the transportation group did not "investigate" again. On October 20, the opportunity that Sun Xianglong was waiting for arrived. The Management Office sent Sun to Shijingshan in Beijing to pick up pig iron. The criminal Sun then received 12 million yuan of "travel expenses" as "capital" for his escape. When the criminal Sun arrived in Beijing, all the preparations for his escape were roughly ready, except that he did not bring his family. So, on November 17, he sent a telegram to the Transportation Group of the Management Office saying: "The material collection task is completed, but there are still outstanding procedures to be completed, and I cannot return immediately." Taking advantage of this gap, Sun Xianglong returned to Shanghai, brought his family members, and escaped safely.
    In mid-December, half a month after the criminal Sun absconded, the transportation group did not see Sun return to Shanghai and wrote several letters to Beijing urging him to return, but the letters sent were returned by the post office. At this time, the head of the transportation group began to suspect that something was "a bit strange" and wrote to the Public Security Bureau requesting investigation. By that time, Sun's residence was already empty. But they still did not know the reason for Sun's escape and thought that he had only taken 12 million yuan of travel expenses and escaped.
    It was not until January 15 last year that the transportation group checked the events handled by Sun and, after seeing the document about receiving ten boxes of files, realized the real reason for Sun's escape. At this time, eighteen months had passed since the criminal Sun received the files, nearly five months had passed since the East China Branch of the National Warehouse Materials Allocation Committee sent the second letter, and one and a half months had passed since the criminal Sun absconded.
    From this specific fact, it can be seen that the bureaucratic work style of the Management Office of the East China Industrial Department has become seriously unreasonable. In order to eliminate the obstacles to building the motherland, we must wage a merciless struggle against this bad work style. (Originally published in the Liberation Daily on January 10)

    贪污分子竟领到了“逃逸费”
    ——记华东工业部的一件官僚主义的典型事例
  　王坚
    华东工业部经理处运务组职员孙祥龙盗卖了十箱锉刀，使国家财产损失达六千万元。可是孙祥龙却还堂堂皇皇地领了一千二百万元的“逃逸费”，安然潜逃了。孙祥龙这个盗窃国家财产的罪犯为什么能够这样自由地盗窃国家财产并从容地逃逸呢？一句话：我们机关内部存在着严重的官僚主义作风。
    一九四九年七月，上海解放还不到两个月，当时各机关向军管会物资管理处请领物资时，是由物资管理处签发实物拨付凭证而领取的。物资管理处当时有一张实物凭证签发给华东工业部（当时为军管会重工业处），这张实物凭证中有化验药品一箱，电工仪器一箱，无线电开关一箱，大锉刀十箱，矽块一箱，温度计一箱。华东工业部经理处就派孙祥龙到物资管理处所属“三菱”仓库，提领这六项物资。按照规定，提领后须在三联单上签注发料情形，其中第二联则退还领料机关以便结算的。“三菱”仓库发料时对大锉刀一项没有在第二联上填明实发量，大概以为一、三联已填，可以“以此为证”了，却不知这一“空子”，就给孙祥龙钻进去了。孙在领料回去后，即在第二联上划了横线（表示未领），向领导上报告说：“大锉刀因库无存料，没有领来。”就这样，价值六千万元的十箱锉刀就被盗窃者安然窃去变卖了。
    一九五○年一月二十五日（离开孙祥龙盗卖锉刀的事已经五个多月了，物资管理处也已改为全国仓库物资调配委员会华东分会），全国仓库物资调配委员会华东分会开了领料后的发票，到工业部算账。这张发票经过统计、财务、仓储各组的查核，竟经历了近七个月，到八月十七日才由仓储组查明“此项锉刀确未收到”。因为没有收到，就以为全国仓库物资调配委员会华东分会所开发票不符“事实”，又去信要全国仓库物资调配委员会华东分会“更正”，等到全国仓库物资调配委员会华东分会又来信说明锉刀确已由“你处孙祥龙盖章领讫”时，仓储组就把信转给运务组，运务组长却“照惯例”将此信交给业务部门“查明”，业务部门也“照惯例”，将它交给孙祥龙本人去“查复”。这无疑是给贪污分子送了一个信。于是，孙祥龙把信往抽屉内一锁，寻觅他逃逸的机会了。
    又隔了近两个月，在这期间，孙祥龙既不可能“查复”，运务组再也没有去“查明”。十月二十日，孙祥龙等待着的机会却到了。经理处派孙去北京石景山提运生铁，孙犯当时就领了一千二百万元的“旅运费”，作为他潜逃的“资本”。孙犯到了北京，潜逃的一切准备工作，大致已就绪，只是没有携带家属。于是在十一月十七日打了一个电报给经理处运务组说：“领料任务完毕，但还有未了手续待办理，不能立即回来。”趁这个空隙，孙祥龙即回到上海，携带了他的家眷，安然逸去。
    十二月中旬，离开孙犯潜逃已经半月，运务组没有看到孙回上海，几次写信去北京催促，但送去的信被邮局退了回来。这时候，运务组长才开始怀疑，觉得“有些奇怪”，才去信公安局请求侦查，那时，孙的住处早已人去楼空。但还不知道孙潜逃的原因，只以为他只是拿了一千二百万元旅运费而逃走的。
    直到去年一月十五日，运务组才去检查孙经办的事件，在看到关于领取十箱锉刀的文件后，方才明白孙犯潜逃的真正原因。这时候，距离孙犯领取锉刀的时间已有十八个月，距离全国仓库物资调配委员会华东分会第二次来信时间已近五个月，距离孙犯潜逃的时间也有一个半月了。
    从这一具体事实中，可以看出，华东工业部经理处的官僚主义作风已严重到岂有此理的程度。为了扫除建设祖国的障碍，对这种恶劣的作风，必须进行无情的斗争。（原载一月十日解放日报）
