    Heroic Sisters of the Motherland
  　Sun Yuzhi
    Among the delegates of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning home, there are twenty-nine female comrades. Their heroic deeds, and those of their female comrades-in-arms, are something the people of the motherland can be proud of.

    On the medical front, female soldiers run dozens, even hundreds, of miles a day, from one mountain gully to another, to care for the wounded. In the bitter cold blizzards, in the rainy season of torrential mountain floods, they sometimes work selflessly for days and nights without rest. Under the fire of artillery and enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, they bravely rescue the lives of the wounded. Female delegate Yu Xiangui, who was awarded the Military Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, did not close her eyes for five consecutive days and nights during the Second Campaign in order to care for the wounded. Overwork caused her malaria to recur, and she fainted. When she woke up in bed, as soon as her high fever subsided, she ran to the ward to work. When comrades advised her to rest, she said, "I can't lie down when I think of the wounded comrades." During the Third Campaign, it was bitterly cold and snowy. Liu Jianhui (one of the returning delegates) was so tired from caring for the wounded day and night that she was afraid of dozing off while on night duty, so she stood at the door of the ward and used the cold wind to wake herself up. Wang Zihou from a certain unit saw a severely wounded soldier with a large hole in the back of his hand, and the wound was difficult to heal for a while. She asked to cut off her own skin to patch the wound for him. But the wounded soldier argued with her: "No, I've already shed blood, I can't let you shed blood for me again." She replied: "Comrade, I am a Communist Party member, we are class brothers, my flesh is your flesh!" "I'm cutting my flesh to patch your wound, not only for you personally, but so you can get better quickly and make more contributions to the people!" When the wounded soldier was finally persuaded by her, his eyes were filled with sparkling tears.

    The upper right arm of female delegate Xie Xiumei's cotton coat still has a copper-sized hole. This hole was left when she was injured while shielding a wounded soldier with her body. That was one morning two months ago. She was returning from collecting firewood on the mountain when suddenly nine enemy planes came and, before they had finished two turns in the air, began to drop bombs with a deafening roar near the ward. An incendiary bomb set the ward on fire. At this time, she remembered that there was still a severely wounded soldier in the room. She immediately braved the smoke and fire and rushed in, feeling for the wounded soldier and carrying him out. Across from the door was a small hill. Just as she carried him halfway up the hill, a bomb exploded beside them, and the blast threw them down. She looked up and saw two enemy planes diving towards them again, so she quickly lay on top of the wounded soldier to shield him. The wounded soldier said, "Comrade Xie, hurry up and go hide, don't get hurt again because of me." She said, "Comrade, I am a member of the Communist Youth League, I can't let you get wounded again." As she spoke, another bomb fell, and the overturned soil almost buried her. The first thing she did when she woke up was to check if the wounded soldier had been hit. But at this time, her right arm was already injured, and her hands were covered in blood.

    Female comrades who love the wounded are equally loved by the wounded. Some severely wounded soldiers insisted on asking their instructor to come and personally request a commendation for them.

    Female members of the army's cultural troupes, when marching, have to keep up with the male comrades and rush to the front of the troops to carry out propaganda and mobilization work along the way. In battle, they go deep into the front lines, representing the leaders and the wishes of the people of the motherland, to comfort and encourage the soldiers. Their songs and performances became a force on the front lines to inspire combat. One cultural troupe climbed several large and small mountains in a single day, taking turns performing eight shows for the troops. The soldiers were moved to see some young female comrades, only twelve or thirteen years old, had also come and said, "They don't need to perform for us, just seeing them gives us the energy to kill American devils." When they went to the positions, they not only sang and danced for the soldiers, but also carried needles and thread to mend clothes for the soldiers. As long as the soldiers saw the female comrade carrying a huqin in the distance on the front lines, their morale immediately soared. The soldiers used the heroic spirit of the female comrades on the front lines to encourage themselves to kill more enemies. The soldiers took out the biscuits sent by the motherland, which they were reluctant to eat themselves, and offered them to the female comrades.

    Female comrades engaged in telegraph work stay at their communication machines day and night, closely linking the victories on the Korean battlefield with our great motherland. They work in the bitter cold of minus ten degrees Celsius. When their fingers are frozen, they use their fists to send messages. Female telephone operator Ding Shufen (returning delegate) of a model telephone station of the Chinese People's Volunteers Railway Corps, continued to work beside the telephone switchboard even when enemy planes had collapsed half of their studio and the room was filled with smoke and fire.

    Female comrades in the political work departments have to do the work of two or three people alone. They write, carve, and print in small air-raid shelters where they cannot straighten their backs. It is very common for them to not sleep for several nights. Female delegate Xi Ning, who works as a newspaper editor, said, "Sometimes I am so sleepy that I can't keep my eyes open, but when I see that I am holding a manuscript written on a cigarette box by a soldier from the front line, covered in mud and oil, my spirits immediately lift."

    Female delegate Zhang Weimin is a propaganda officer of a certain artillery regiment. She left her child to go to Korea to fight in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea before her child was even a month old. During the long march, she went deep into the companies to help with work. Later, she was wounded in the head by enemy planes and her body gradually became weak, but she still worked tenaciously and never complained. Sometimes when others asked about her child, she always said: "Which mother doesn't love her own child, but I came to Korea to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in order to protect my own children and the children of other mothers!"

    Among the female soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, many are members of the Communist Youth League, and their heroic deeds are unforgettable. Once, a Communist Youth League member, nurse Chen Fengying, braved enemy bombing to rescue the wounded from the ward and settle them properly. As soon as she entered the air-raid shelter, she heard a shout from an old Korean woman outside the shelter. She quickly ran out and saw the old woman pointing at her house, which had just been set on fire by enemy planes. Chen Fengying did not hesitate to brave the enemy bombing, climbed onto the house, quickly tore off the burning thatch, and put out the fire. During the Fifth Campaign, a nineteen-year-old female member of the Communist Youth League in a certain unit had both legs broken by enemy planes during the march. When passing through an intense and dense enemy artillery blockade line, she refused to let her comrades carry her any further. She said, "You are all useful people, don't suffer losses because of taking care of me." As she spoke, she was about to roll off the stretcher, but how could the comrades let her? Several people went up and held her down. After passing through the enemy blockade line, she finally gave her young and beautiful life due to excessive blood loss. After her mother learned of her daughter's sacrifice, she wrote a letter to the comrades who had worked with her during her lifetime. The letter said: My daughter has sacrificed herself. Although I am extremely sad in my heart, I did not cry, because she sacrificed herself to protect peace. I am proud to have such a daughter.

    After reading this letter to all the comrades, everyone was extremely moved. Some comrades said, "Only a heroic mother can raise such a heroic daughter!" Then another comrade said, "Let me add another sentence—our motherland is a heroic country, only then can it raise such heroic sisters as us!"

    祖国的英雄姊妹们
  　孙浴之
    在志愿军归国代表团的代表里，有二十九位女同志。她们和她们的女战友们的英勇事迹，是值得祖国人民引以自豪的。
    在医务战线上的女战士们，一天跑几十里以至百多里的路，从一个山沟到另一个山沟去护理伤员。在严寒的大风雪里，在山洪暴发的雨季里，她们有时忘我地工作几天几夜不休息。在炮火和敌机轰炸、扫射之下，她们奋不顾身地救出伤员的生命。荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国军功章的女代表于宪桂，在第二次战役时，为了护理伤员，曾连续五昼夜未合眼，过度的疲劳使她的疟疾复发，她昏倒了。当她在床上醒过来，身上高热刚一退，她又跑到病室去工作。同志们劝她休息，她说：“我一想到负了伤的同志，再也躺不下了。”第三次战役时正是冰天雪地的严寒时节，刘剑辉（归国代表之一）因为昼夜护理伤员太疲劳了，她值夜班时怕自己打瞌睡，就站在病室门口用冷风来吹醒自己。某部王子厚看到一个重伤员的手背上打了个很大的洞，伤口一时很难愈合，她就要求割自己的皮去给他补伤口。可是伤员和她争执起来了：“不，我流了血，不能让你再为我流血。”她回答说：“同志，我是个共产党员，我们是阶级兄弟，我的肉就是你的肉！”“我割肉给你补伤口，不光是为了你个人，你快点好起来，可以更多地为人民立功！”这个伤员最后被她说服时，眼睛里噙满了晶莹的热泪。
    女代表解秀梅的棉衣右上臂，直到现在还留有一个铜元大的窟窿。这个窟窿是她在以自己的身体掩蔽伤员时受伤留下的。那是在两个月前的一天上午，她正从山上打柴回来，突然来了九架敌机，在空中两个旋还没打完，就轰轰隆隆在病房附近投炸弹。燃烧弹把病房烧着了。这时她记起了屋里还有一个重伤员，她立刻冒着烟火冲进去，摸着伤员便往外背。门对面是个小山，刚背到山半腰，一颗炸弹在他们身旁爆炸，气浪把他们冲倒了。她抬头一看两架敌机又朝着他们俯冲下来，她就很快地伏在伤员身上掩蔽他。伤员说：“解同志，你赶快走开隐蔽吧，别因为我再伤了你。”她说：“同志，我是个青年团员，我不能让你再负一次伤。”正说着一颗炸弹又落了下来，炸翻的土块几乎把她埋起来。她醒过来第一件事就是先摸摸炸着伤员没有。但这时候，她的右臂已经受伤，手上流满了鲜血。
    热爱伤员的女同志们，同样为伤员们所热爱。有的重伤员一定要把她们的指导员请来，亲自给她们请求记功。
    部队里的女文工队员们，在行军时要和男同志一起，赶到部队的前头，去做沿途的宣传鼓动工作。在战斗中，她们深入到前沿阵地，代表着首长，代表着祖国人民的心意去慰问和鼓励战士们。她们的歌声和演出，成为火线上鼓舞战斗的力量。有一个文工队，曾在一天中连爬好几个大小山，轮番给部队演出八场。战士们看到有些十二三岁的年幼的女同志也来了，感动地说：“她们不要演戏给我们看，只要看到她们，我们杀美国鬼子那股劲就来了。”她们到阵地上不仅给战士歌唱和舞蹈，还随身带着针线给战士们缝补衣服。在前沿阵地上只要远远地望见背胡琴的女同志，战士们的情绪立刻高涨起来。战士们以女同志上火线的英勇精神来鼓励自己更加多杀敌人。战士们把祖国寄来的自己舍不得吃的饼干，拿出来请她们吃。
    从事报务工作的女同志，日日夜夜守在自己的通讯机面前，把朝鲜战场上的胜利和我们伟大祖国紧紧地联在一起。她们在零下十几度的严寒里工作，手指冻僵了，就用拳头发报。志愿军铁道兵团指挥部某模范电话所女电话员丁淑芬（归国代表），在敌机把她们的工作室炸塌了一半，屋里充满了烟火时，仍然坚守在电话交换机旁工作。
    政治工作部门的女同志，一个人要做两个人，三个人的工作。她们在伸不直腰的小防空洞里，写着、刻着、印着，几夜不睡在她们是很平常的事。女代表洗宁是做报纸编辑工作的，她说：“有时困的实在睁不开眼了，可是一看到自己手上拿着的是战士从火线上寄来的用纸烟盒写成的稿子，上边还沾满了泥和油时，精神马上又抖擞起来了。”
    女代表张慰民是某部炮兵团的宣传干事。她生了孩子还没满月，就丢下小孩出国到朝鲜作战。在长途行军中她深入到连队去帮助工作。后来她被敌机打伤了头部，身体逐渐瘦弱了，但是她仍是顽强地工作着，从不叫一声苦。有时别人问起关于她孩子的事来，她总是说：“当母亲的谁不疼爱自己的孩子，但我到朝鲜来抗美援朝，就是为了保卫我自己和其他当母亲的人的孩子！”
    在志愿军的女战士里面，有许多是青年团员，她们的英勇事迹是使人难以忘却的。有一次，青年团员护士陈凤英，冒着敌机的轰炸从病室里把伤员抢救出来并安置妥当之后，刚走进防空洞，又听到洞外一个朝鲜老大娘的呼喊声，她赶快跑出来一看，老大娘正在指划着她自己刚被敌机打燃了的房子，陈凤英毫不犹豫地冒着敌机轰炸爬上了房屋，迅速地将燃着的茅草扯下来，把火扑灭了。在第五次战役的时候，某部一个十九岁的女青年团员，在行军中被敌机打断了两条腿。当通过敌人激烈而又密集的炮火封锁线时，她怎么也不让同志们再抬她了，她说：“你们都是些有用的人呀，别因为照顾我再受了损失。”她说着就要往担架下边滚，同志们那能让呢，上去几个人才把她按住了。通过敌人封锁线后，她因为流血过多，终于献出了她的年青而美丽的生命。她的母亲知道了自己的女儿牺牲之后，写了一封信给和她生前一起工作的同志。信上说：我的女儿牺牲了，虽然我心中极度难过，但我没有哭，因为她是为了保卫和平而牺牲的。我为我能有这样的女儿而感到骄傲。
    当把这封信给全体同志宣读了之后，大家感动极了，有的同志说：“母亲是英雄，才能教养出这样英雄的女儿！”接着另一个同志说：“让我再补充一句——我们祖国是英雄的国家，才能教养出我们这样英雄的姊妹！”（附图片）
