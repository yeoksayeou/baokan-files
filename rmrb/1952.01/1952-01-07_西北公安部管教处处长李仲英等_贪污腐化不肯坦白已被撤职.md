Li Zhongying, Director of the Reform-Through-Labor Bureau of the Northwest Public Security Department, and three others have been dismissed by the People's Supervisory Committee of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee for corruption, degeneration, violation of laws and regulations, and refusal to confess their mistakes.

Li Zhongying, Director of the Reform-Through-Labor Bureau of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Public Security Department, joined the revolution in 1934 and successively held important positions such as regiment commander, army commander, and military sub-district commander in the Red Army and the People's Liberation Army. When he was the commander of the Linxia Military Sub-district in Gansu, he was transferred due to errors in implementing ethnic policies. However, he failed to learn from this mistake and remained passive in his work and lax in his studies after assuming his current position as Director of the Reform-Through-Labor Bureau of the Public Security Department. He also smoked opium dozens of times, established extremely abnormal personal relationships with unscrupulous merchants, and privately lent over 200 million yuan of labor reform funds managed by the Reform-Through-Labor Bureau to unscrupulous merchants, which has not yet been fully recovered. In June 1951, he instructed Lu Shenggen, the finance section chief of the Reform-Through-Labor Bureau, to tell his younger brother to purchase 200,000 yuan worth of opium on his behalf.

Zhu Mingxiao, Political Commissar of the Public Security Regiment of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Public Security Department, joined the revolution in 1932 and served as chief of the county security section, section chief of the public security sub-office, and battalion commander of the security battalion. Despite holding the position of political commissar of the People's Public Security Forces regiment, he failed to lead by example and maintain the glorious tradition of hard work of the People's Army, becoming a role model for soldiers and cadres. Instead, he was corrupt, arbitrarily violated the discipline of the People's Army. In August 1951, he became acquainted with Huang Weiyuan, manager of the Xi'an Huada Commercial Firm, and Hui Kunsheng, of the Qin Feng Commercial Firm. Under the inducement of these unscrupulous merchants, he smoked opium dozens of times and accepted bribes from them on several occasions. In February of the same year, he exchanged a public bicycle for a six-round pistol, and in April, he exchanged another public bicycle for a carbine. Particularly serious was the fact that the unscrupulous merchant Huang Weiyuan asked Zhu to borrow two sets of military uniforms, obtain a military pass, and borrow a car to transport two large packages of opium to the train station. Zhu agreed without any hesitation, but fortunately, other comrades objected, and it did not happen.

Lu Shenggen, Finance Section Chief of the Public Security Department's Reform-Through-Labor Bureau, joined the revolution in 1935 and served as district chief, security section chief, and supply director of the public security regiment. He had also received years of revolutionary training, but he failed to maintain a hard-working style and was unwilling to work loyally. He was corrupt and violated laws and regulations. In July and August 1950, he became acquainted with some unscrupulous merchants from the Xi'an Qin Feng Commercial Firm, Hong Feng Stationery Store, and Qing Yuan Commercial Firm, and smoked opium over thirty times. He also purchased opium on behalf of Zhu Mingxiao, Political Commissar of the Public Security Regiment, four times. When Li Zhongying, Director of the Reform-Through-Labor Bureau, lent 200 million yuan of public funds to unscrupulous merchants, Lu assisted him. When the Public Security Regiment sold old military uniforms, Lu embezzled a watch and privately exchanged a Mauser C96 pistol for a ten-round pistol.

Liang Jianhua, Director of the General Affairs Office of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Finance Department, was irresponsible, did not seek progress, lived a corrupt life, and behaved improperly. Preliminary investigations have revealed that he accepted bribes from unscrupulous merchants totaling more than 10.7 million yuan, embezzled 15 million yuan of public funds by smoking opium, and privately misappropriated public funds and lent 276 million yuan of public funds to unscrupulous merchants.

The above four individuals are corrupt and degenerate elements in the revolutionary ranks. After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy rectification movement, they still failed to confess their mistakes and correct their errors. It was only after being reported and exposed by others that they superficially admitted their wrongdoings.

The Northwest Public Security Department and the Finance Department are continuing to investigate their crimes.

    西北公安部管教处处长李仲英等
    贪污腐化不肯坦白已被撤职
    西北军政委员会公安部管教处处长李仲英等四人贪污蜕化，违法乱纪，不肯坦白认错，已被西北军政委员会人民监察委员会撤职。
    西北军政委员会公安部管教处处长李仲英，一九三四年参加革命，曾历任红军和人民解放军的团长、军长、军分区司令员等要职。在他任甘肃临夏军分区司令员时，因执行民族政策犯了错误而被调职。但他未能很好接受这次错误的教训，在新任现职——公安部管教处处长后，仍是工作消极，学习松懈，并曾前后吸食毒品数十次，和奸商建立极不正常的私人关系，把管教处主管的劳动改造经费两亿多元私自借给奸商，至今尚不能全部收回。一九五一年六月他曾令管教处财务科长卢生根转告他弟弟代买了二十万元的毒品。
    西北军政委员会公安部公安团政治委员朱明晓，一九三二年参加革命，历任县保安科长、公安分处股长、保卫营营长等职。他虽身任人民公安部队的团政治委员，但不能以身作则，保持人民军队艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，成为战士、干部表率，反而贪污腐化，任意破坏人民军队纪律。一九五一年八月，结识了西安华达商行经理黄维元、秦丰商行惠崐生。在这些奸商的引诱下，他数十次地吸食毒品，并接受奸商贿赂多次；同年二月，他以公家自行车一辆换取别人六轮手枪一支，四月又以公家自行车一辆换取别人卡宾枪一支。特别严重的是：奸商黄维元曾要求朱借给军衣两套，开军人护照一张，并借用汽车一辆，将两大包毒品送至火车站。朱竟毫无立场地答应了，幸经其他同志反对，未成事实。
    公安部管教处财务科长卢生根，一九三五年参加革命，曾任区长、保卫科长、公安团供给主任等职。他也曾受过多年的革命培养，但不能保持艰苦作风，也不肯忠诚地工作，他贪污腐化，违法乱纪。一九五○年七、八月间，即与西安秦丰商行、鸿丰文具店、庆元商行等部分奸商结交，前后吸食毒品三十余次，又为公安团政治委员朱明晓代买毒品四次。管教处长李仲英把公款两亿元借给奸商时，卢为协助者。在公安团出卖旧军衣时，卢贪污手表一只，又以三号驳壳枪一支私自换取别人十子连手枪一支。
    西北军政委员会财政部总务处处长梁建华，不负责任，不求进步，生活腐化，行为不轨，经初步检查，已发现接受奸商贿赂一千零七十余万元，因吸食毒品侵吞公款一千五百万元，私自挪用公款和借给奸商公款二亿七千六百余万元。
    上述四人，都是革命队伍中的贪污蜕化分子。在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的整风运动开展后，他们仍不能坦白认错，痛改前非，直至被别人检举揭露，才肤浅承认。
    西北公安部、财政部对他们的罪行现仍在继续调查中。
