Comrades,
    The great anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has gradually unfolded in Beijing and throughout the country. This is a new revolutionary movement of historical significance, just as important as the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, land reform, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Because our country was newly established on the ruins of thousands of years of feudal rule, in order to guarantee the victory of the revolution and meet the historical tasks of national construction, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has become an absolutely indispensable revolutionary movement. I am not yet able to report to you on the national situation regarding corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, but just looking at the preliminary findings of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy within the central-level military and government organs directly under the Central People's Government from December 10th to the present, one can fully understand the necessity of Chairman Mao's call to the nation last December to launch an anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.
    I. The Situation of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement in Central Government Organs
    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the central organs in Beijing began around December 10th of last year, and it has been almost a month now. Before December 31st of last year, the movement generally made some progress, and a few departments mobilized the masses relatively well; however, as far as the overall situation is concerned, most units still did not sufficiently recognize the important significance of this movement, and therefore, the guidance for the movement has not been able to implement the policy of vigorous and swift action. After Chairman Mao's instructions, the situation of insufficient attention to the movement and insufficient freedom in mobilizing the masses has fundamentally changed since New Year's Day this year. Now it can be said that this great mass movement in the central organs in Beijing has been vigorously and swiftly launched, and in some units it has already gone deep.
    Judging from the materials discovered in a month of movement, the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are no longer isolated problems, and have already aroused the indignation of the broad masses. According to incomplete preliminary materials, the number of corrupt individuals discovered in 27 units in the government system totaled more than 1,670. Song Degui, the director of the Administrative Office of the Central Public Security Department, embezzled 700 million yuan alone by forging fake receipts. Liu Yuze, the deputy director of the office, accepted bribes of over 140 million yuan. Man Yan, the deputy director of the Health Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways, colluded with others to privately purchase opium and privately manufacture 100 catties of morphine. The three criminals Song, Liu, and Man have now been arrested and dealt with according to law. More instances of waste have been discovered. Within the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission and the railway system, a total of 5,000 tons of gasoline were lost in 1951 alone due to improper handling of oil tank cars. In addition, 2,000 tons of gasoline were rendered completely ineffective due to carelessness and lack of knowledge in mixing different types of oil. The Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, under the Central Ministry of Textile Industry, has received a total investment of over 400 billion yuan from the government. The main factory building covers an area of 45 mu. Due to inadequate design and poor construction, 280 of the 289 columns in the factory building have subsided unevenly before the project was even completed, and remedies are now being sought. When the inspection team of the People's Bank of China headquarters inspected work in Henan Province, the Henan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank spent over 250 million yuan on hospitality expenses, entertaining more than 100 people with over 1 million yuan worth of firecracker cigarettes, and over 1,000 catties of apples, 1,600 catties of bananas, pears, sugar, melon seeds, and so on. Violations of financial discipline are also very serious. First of all, the phenomenon of turning public funds into small public funds is quite common, reaching 73 billion yuan in the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry alone. Although most of this was used for legitimate purposes, this action was illegal. The phenomenon of creating false accounts based on departmentalism has also been discovered a lot. Lu Da, the deputy director of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, fabricated 50.3 billion yuan in expenses for the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Factory. Lu Da has been dismissed as a result. In the past, engaging in production by organs had a certain role, but now it has become an important factor in undermining finances and corrupting cadres. The reason why Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were able to unscrupulously carry out corruption and waste is because the production activities of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee were a cover for their malfeasance and a breeding ground for filth. As for the misuse of special funds, ambushing superior financial organs, and the lack of distinction between public and private in daily life, these are even more common phenomena.
    The relatively widespread existence of corruption, waste, and violations of financial discipline is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of leading comrades in various units. Bureaucracy is a breeding ground for corruption and waste. Wherever bureaucracy is serious, corruption and waste are also most rampant. Some leading comrades, infected with a bureaucratic work style, are high above the masses all day long, formalistically "signing" and "stamping," and do not understand or study the actual work and the situation of the masses. This work style is of course the most favorable condition for corruption and waste. Other comrades, on the other hand, are busy and hardworking all day long, but they expend their energy on some secondary and trivial matters, and cannot grasp the center of their work and the essence of the problem. As a result, they still lack understanding of the actual work and the real situation of the masses, and cannot correctly guide the masses forward. For example, last year the Central Ministry of Trade ordered "three" tons of medicine from the Soviet Union to treat foot-and-mouth disease, but due to the bureaucracy of the drafter, it was mistakenly written as "three hundred" tons. Responsible cadres at all levels who reviewed, verified, and approved the draft did not think twice, but signed and stamped it as usual, resulting in the purchase of 297 tons more. As another example, the Central Ministry of Finance approved 27,000 more people in the national workforce than needed, resulting in an overpayment of 44.8 billion yuan. As another example, for a certain section of the Tianlan Railway, the design engineers designed 13 routes and argued for a year without any result, delaying the construction period and preventing timely construction.
    Due to the education of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, some corrupt elements have begun to awaken, and the confession movement has gradually unfolded in Beijing. According to incomplete statistics from 24 units in the government system, 556 people have already confessed voluntarily, and 250 people in the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission have already confessed voluntarily. Xia Maoru, an engineer of the Central Ministry of Finance, has voluntarily confessed that five people collectively embezzled 340 million yuan, and he himself received 110 million yuan. The confession movement in the industrial and commercial circles of Beijing and Tianjin is also underway.
    Many staff who have indulged in extravagance and waste, or violated financial discipline have, for the most part, already carried out, or are in the process of carrying out, public self-criticism. The self-criticism of leading comrades in most units regarding their bureaucratic work styles has been unprecedentedly widespread and unprecedentedly thorough.
    The masses' enthusiasm for anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy has also begun to be mobilized. According to preliminary statistics from 18 units in the government system, 823 people have already participated in making accusations, and the number of people accused, according to incomplete statistics from 20 units, is 322. According to preliminary statistics from the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission, 566 people participated in making accusations, and 37 people were accused. The supervisory correspondents of the People's Supervisory Committee of the State Council have also begun to be active during this period. The aforementioned case of Man Yan was exposed by supervisory correspondent Comrade Shi Xinen. Xu Yizhou, a supervisory correspondent of the Central Ministry of Labor, accused a person in charge of the ministry of falsely claiming over 240 million yuan in expenses for the improvement of equipment and living conditions of the unit. The mass accusation movement must be developed in every way possible in the future.
    II. The Nature of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement
    From the above situation, it appears that the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are serious within the Chinese Communist Party organizations, within the People's Government, within the system of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and within the people's mass organizations. If these phenomena are not opposed and overcome, they will pose a great danger to the Chinese Communist Party and all democratic parties, to the Central People's Government and all levels of local governments, to the entire People's Liberation Army, to our country's economic and cultural undertakings, and to all people's organizations.
    This danger is manifested in both economic and political aspects. What everyone can feel most easily is first in the economic aspect. The greatest harm of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to us in the economic aspect is that they massively waste the most valuable funds for building our country and corrupt our country's economic construction endeavors. Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, a very large amount of our country's funds has already been embezzled and wasted. And a very large amount of funds is still being embezzled and wasted. If this situation cannot be fundamentally changed, even more funds will inevitably be embezzled and wasted. What is the role of funds for our country? After the victory of the revolution, after the political conditions for building the country have been met, funds are the basic condition for building the country. Without sufficient funds, our country can never be industrialized. That is to say, even though the revolution has been victorious, if we do not have the necessary funds, we cannot build a new democratic economy, let alone talk about the future of socialism and communism. The source of funds for our country is still very difficult at present. The old China ruled by imperialism, the landlord class, and the bureaucrat-capitalist class was a backward agricultural country. Therefore, our current accumulation of funds for industrialization can only be accumulated primarily from agriculture first, and then gradually increase the accumulation from industry. Accumulating funds from agriculture is much slower than accumulating them from industry. Therefore, the contradiction between our country's existing funds and the needs of national economic construction is very large. That is to say, the amount of funds that our country can now accumulate and use for economic construction is far behind the needs of national construction and must be used very carefully and very economically. In this situation, a large amount of funds has been embezzled and wasted. What is the result? There is no other result than inevitably delaying the progress of our country's construction. The economic losses caused by corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are not only in terms of funds, but also often cause serious damage to many construction projects that have already been carried out. Many industrial and mining enterprises have thus weakened their production capacity or shortened their lifespan.
    The political danger of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy lies in gradually corrupting our party, government, military, and civilian cadres, thereby alienating them from reality, alienating them from the masses, and even alienating them from the revolution. This situation will inevitably create a great gap for counter-revolutionaries. Historical experience proves that wherever corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are serious, it is inevitably a place where counter-revolutionaries can easily hide. And once revolutionary cadres degenerate into corrupt and degenerate elements, they are also in political danger of being utilized and bought by counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, the problem of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy is not an ordinary problem, but a fundamental big problem that concerns the success or failure of the revolution, and concerns the entire party, the entire army, all government personnel, and the entire people. If we cannot achieve a decisive victory on this front, we cannot guarantee the victory of the revolution, nor can we guarantee the smooth progress of national construction. This is a great political and economic struggle that concerns the overall situation. In the face of this struggle, any locality, any department, any individual, if they adopt a bureaucratic attitude of paralysis and wait-and-see, will inevitably commit a serious mistake.
    Of course, the current phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy nationwide are not comparable to those during the reactionary Kuomintang government period. The reactionary Kuomintang government itself was a large group of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Under that reactionary government, corruption, waste, and bureaucracy would only develop and could never be eliminated. And our central and all levels of people's governments are unprecedentedly clean governments in the history of our country, and the vast majority of our staff live a hard life and serve the people wholeheartedly. But why are the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy still more serious in our party, within the People's Government, within the People's Liberation Army, and within people's organizations than during the liberated areas before the victory of the revolution? Has the quality of our party, government, army, and people's organizations deteriorated after victory? Is it that the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in our country cannot be eradicated even by us? Without a doubt, we have not regressed, but have progressed. The phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy have not expanded compared to the Kuomintang rule, nor are they the same as then, but have been reduced much more, but they have developed compared to the liberated areas before the victory of the revolution. The seriousness of the problem lies here.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, have united the people of the whole country and achieved brilliant and great victories on all fronts of politics, military affairs, economics, culture, and diplomacy. Up to now, the feudal system of thousands of years in China has been basically overthrown; the vast remaining counter-revolutionary forces spread by imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits have been basically destroyed; the last powerful American imperialism in the world, the war of aggression launched in Korea with the primary purpose of aggression against Korea and China, has been basically defeated; the inflation and price fluctuations left to us by the Kuomintang reactionary rule have been overcome; and the declining industrial and agricultural production has generally approached the highest level in the past, and has partially exceeded it. These are undeniable historical victories. If our party, our government, our People's Liberation Army, our People's Democratic United Front were not basically clean, healthy, strong, and correct, it would not have been possible to achieve these victories. The reason why we are now able to resolutely launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the nationwide, in all systems of the party, government, military, and civilian sectors, is because our party, our government, our army, and our People's Democratic United Front are basically clean, healthy, strong, and correct.
    The reason why the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy still exist in our revolutionary ranks, and have developed more than in the liberated areas before the victory, is due to two aspects. On the one hand, it is because after the victory of the revolution, a large number of old reactionary government personnel who held old ideas and old work styles and had not had time to be transformed joined the People's Government and state-owned enterprises. On the other hand, and more importantly, it is because after the victory of the revolution, in a peaceful environment, many comrades in our party, in the government, in the army, in the People's Democratic United Front, especially many leading comrades, did not fully guard against the erosion of bourgeois ideology on the revolution. During the period of the New Democratic Revolution, the national bourgeoisie had a considerable position in politics and economics and played a certain role. This class existed legally under the leadership of the working class. During the New Democratic period, it was also permissible for the national bourgeoisie to obtain certain profits in their operations under the principle of acknowledging the leadership of the working class and acknowledging the leadership of the state-owned economy. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese bourgeoisie has made considerable efforts in supplying the country and the people with necessities, in resisting America and aiding Korea, and in donating airplanes and artillery, and this should also be acknowledged. However, the bourgeois ideas of exploiting the masses, living without labor, benefiting oneself at the expense of others, prioritizing profit, seeking private gain at public expense, engaging in speculation, being extravagant and wasteful, and prioritizing enjoyment, are extremely harmful to the revolutionary and construction undertakings. Within the People's Democratic United Front, the above-mentioned bourgeois ideas can only be the object of criticism and transformation, and cannot be allowed to spread freely and harm the country. In particular, this corrupt and degenerate thinking must not be allowed to spread within the Communist Party, within the working class, within the People's Government, within the People's Liberation Army, within state-owned enterprises, and within the leadership departments of the People's Democratic United Front. Only in this way can the purity of the leadership departments and the revolutionary ranks be maintained. In society, this corrupt and degenerate thinking should also be severely criticized. Because only in this way can the working class further lead the revolution towards socialism through the reforms and construction of the New Democratic period.
    Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee had foreseen the danger of bourgeois corrupt and degenerate thinking to the revolution long ago. When the nationwide revolutionary victory was about to come in March 1949, Chairman Mao pointed out: "There may be some communists who have not been conquered by the enemies with guns, and they are worthy of the title of heroes in the face of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attacks of shells wrapped in sugar coating, and they will be defeated in front of the sugar shells. We must prevent this situation." However, many comrades did not carefully appreciate Chairman Mao's wise instructions on this issue. In the party organizations, armies, government organs, state-owned enterprises, and people's organizations they led, they allowed the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets to attack everywhere. They even regarded sugar-coated bullets as tonic medicine. As a result, under their leadership, some cadres were corrupted, some organizations were demoralized, and even some leading comrades themselves were hit by bourgeois sugar-coated bullets to varying degrees. People like Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were completely destroyed by sugar-coated bullets. After entering the city, some other people also learned from the bad habits of the bourgeoisie in many aspects. For example, in construction issues, they pursued appearance and paid attention to form, instead of advocating a simple, economical, solid, and durable style; in trade, they did not consider policies and cherish resources, but paid attention to entertaining guests, giving gifts, and private connections; in life, they did not advocate simplicity and hardship, but learned extravagance and enjoyment. Individual senior cadres even said: "Eat well, sleep well, and complete the task!" Therefore, the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is essentially a struggle against bourgeois corrupt and degenerate thinking. It is also a resolute counterattack against the rampant offensive launched by the bourgeoisie against the working class and the Chinese Communist Party in the past three years, suppressing this reactionary offensive, and giving political transformation and legal sanctions to this reactionary ugly thinking and behavior of the bourgeoisie. Only in this way can the victory of the revolution be guaranteed. This is a serious class struggle, and we must win victory in this struggle.
    III. The Guidelines and Policies of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement
    Generally speaking, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the central organs in Beijing has now basically been launched. The vast majority of leaders have made self-criticisms, and the confession and accusation movement has been initially launched. Especially in the week after the New Year, the movement has developed more rapidly. This is a very good phenomenon. However, the development of the movement is still very uneven. The movement has not yet gone deep in most units, nor is it widespread enough. The self-criticism of the leading comrades in a small number of units is still not thorough enough, and therefore they have not been able to effectively mobilize the masses. In some units, although the leaders' self-criticism is relatively thorough, the middle-level leading cadres have not made serious self-criticisms. There are also a small number of units that have kept the self-criticism movement from top to bottom within the party, and have not quickly met with the broad masses. In addition, there are a small number of units, or a small number of departments in a unit, that feel that there is no possibility of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in their areas, and they do not have a deep understanding of the great significance of this movement. All these unsatisfactory phenomena must be thoroughly corrected. The responsible comrades and communist organizations in each unit must ensure that the masses are fully mobilized within the shortest possible time, and must ensure that this movement penetrates into every corner. Every Communist Party member, every People's Government staff member, every commander, fighter, political worker, and logistics worker of the People's Liberation Army, and every component of the People's Democratic United Front, must be tempered and educated by this revolutionary movement. Anyone who resists this movement should be immediately dismissed, just like Zhang Wen'ang, the director of the General Office of the Central Ministry of Transportation.
    According to a month of experience, the key to whether the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement can be carried out and deepened lies first in whether the leaders of each unit can set an example and take the lead in self-criticism. As long as the leaders do a good job of self-criticism in front of the masses, the masses will definitely be able to mobilize quickly and enthusiastically. After the leaders' self-criticism, responsible cadres at all levels should make self-criticisms in front of the masses level by level, without any exceptions. The self-criticism of responsible cadres at all levels should meet with the masses as quickly as possible, guiding and concentrating the spearhead of mass struggle to anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, and should not turn small circles within the party. Because the problem of opposing corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is not only a problem within the Chinese Communist Party, but a common demand of the entire people. Communists have only more strict responsibilities on this issue. Party members should not only be supervised by the party, but also by the masses. In the movement in individual units, the phenomenon of disunity among leading cadres has occurred. Individual responsible cadres have added some personal feelings to this serious revolutionary struggle, so that the self-criticism of leading comrades cannot play a powerful exemplary leading role among the masses, but instead affects the emotions of the masses and confuses the goals of the mass struggle. This phenomenon must be corrected immediately, otherwise the cadres who should be responsible for this problem will be subject to organizational discipline. In order to fully mobilize the masses, under the general guideline of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, the leading comrades of each unit should not subjectively limit the scope of the mass movement. The situations of each unit are different, and the focus of the movement may be different in some parts, but whatever shortcomings there are, they should be opposed. Whatever shortcomings are most prominent, the masses will naturally demand to oppose them first. There must be absolutely no restriction on the struggle of the masses here. Some units are clearly the most serious in bureaucracy, but the leading comrades only allow the masses to oppose corruption and waste; some units are clearly the most serious in corruption, but only allow the masses to first oppose waste; and some units currently only allow the masses to oppose corruption, but do not allow the development of the struggle against waste and bureaucracy; all these are wrong. All responsible persons who attempt to restrict the masses and avoid struggle should immediately make public self-criticisms in front of the masses and publicly correct their wrong practices.
    All acts of corruption are illegal and should be appropriately punished according to the severity of the circumstances. However, all corrupt elements, except those who are guilty of heinous crimes, if they can make voluntary and thorough confessions, can be given a lighter sentence at the discretion of the court, and those who have committed minor crimes can be exempted from punishment. If, in addition to their own confession, they can also accuse other corrupt elements, they can be credited for their meritorious service depending on the circumstances. In general, corrupt elements should quickly distinguish between right and wrong, eliminate concerns, and should not think that they will lose their political future after confession. Because the act of corruption itself has already caused the corrupt elements to lose their future. If they confess and start anew, they still have a certain future. Some people are afraid of being punished after confessing. They do not know that corruption will definitely be punished, and that confession may be given a lighter sentence or be exempted from punishment depending on the circumstances. Some people are afraid of recovering stolen goods. Of course, stolen goods must be recovered, but the method of returning stolen goods for confessors can be handled at the discretion of the situation.
    All law-breaking industrialists and businessmen should confess to the government within a limited time. A struggle against bribery, against tax evasion, against theft of state property, against shoddy work and materials, and against theft of state economic intelligence should be launched in the industrial and commercial circles. It must be known that bribery of state personnel, tax evasion, using various fraudulent methods to steal state property in transactions with the state, reducing labor and materials when undertaking commissioned processing, accepting orders, or undertaking construction projects, reporting low prices as high prices, using bad products as good products, and stealing economic intelligence from state personnel are all despicable habits left over from the old society, are criminal acts that violate the laws and disciplines of the new China, and are absolutely intolerable to the People's Government. All industrialists and businessmen who have committed the above-mentioned illegal acts should truthfully confess to the government, publicly declare repentance, and guarantee that the same mistakes will not occur again in the future. The government may, at its discretion, reduce or exempt the punishment for industrialists and businessmen who have committed the above-mentioned illegal acts, except for those who are guilty of heinous crimes, if they can voluntarily and thoroughly confess. All acts of tax evasion must be stopped. Those who have evaded taxes should pay them back, and those who do not confess should not only pay back but should also be punished.
    All personnel who violate financial discipline, whether it is turning public funds into small public funds, falsely reporting expenses, ambushing superior financial organs, misusing special funds, exceeding system expenditures, or failing to distinguish between public and private, should quickly conduct a review, faithfully and in detail explain the situation, and await handling. If there is any act of corruption among them, it will be handled as corruption. All organ production should quickly clear accounts and await handling. In the process of clearing, destructive, theft, dispersion of property, and removal of manpower are absolutely prohibited.
    All staff who have engaged in extravagant and wasteful behavior should make a public self-criticism in front of the masses. Not only should the facts of waste be exposed, but also the ideological roots of waste should be explained, and a guarantee should be given that it will not be committed again.
    All staff who have committed bureaucratic errors should make a public self-criticism in front of the masses. Those whose circumstances are serious may have their punishment reduced if their self-criticism is thorough.
    In order to quickly and thoroughly expose the serious phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, in addition to calling on corrupt elements to confess and those who have made mistakes to make self-criticisms, a mass accusation movement should be launched across the country. Only by fully developing the accusation movement can all acts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy lose their place to hide. Only by cultivating the habit of accusation among the people of the whole country and among all staff can people with acts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy have some fear. Accusation of acts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is a patriotic act, just like accusation of counter-revolutionaries. All patriots should not adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards acts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. For the common interests of the country and the people, all patriots should bravely undertake the task of accusation. The government will definitely give spiritual and material rewards to personnel who actively participate in accusation and achieve remarkable results. The method of accusation can be based on the accuser's voluntary choice: oral, written, signed, and anonymous, public and secret are all acceptable. It is of course good to have complete materials for the content of the accusation, but partial materials, or even just some clues, are also acceptable. The government will be responsible for investigating all accusation materials, and then decide on the handling method based on accurate facts, and will never falsely accuse good people. The government guarantees the safety of accusers and absolutely does not allow anyone to take retaliatory action. Anyone who retaliates against accusers will be strictly punished. The people's supervisory organs in all parts of the country should set up people's accusation reception rooms, and all organs should set up suggestion boxes to facilitate the development of the accusation movement.
    IV. Struggle for the Victory of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement
    Comrades! I have spoken about the situation of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the nature of this movement, and our guidelines and policies for this movement. I will now answer another question, that is, whether this movement can truly achieve victory. Some people believe that corruption, waste, and bureaucracy have "always been the case since ancient times" and are the prevailing ethos of old China and cannot be reversed in the short term. Without a doubt, we acknowledge that the ideological style of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has a broad social foundation. Precisely because of this, we treat the problem of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy as a serious political problem. The reason why Chairman Mao launched this movement is not only based on necessity, but also fully estimated the possibility of thoroughly solving this problem. The first favorable condition is the support of the people. After the people became the masters of the country, after the interests of the people and the interests of the country were unified, according to more than two years of experience, the majority of people across the country not only expressed dissatisfaction with the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, but also were willing to resolutely fight against this phenomenon. In the new China, corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are not like in the reactionary regime, where the people cannot have the freedom to oppose them. From more than two years of experience, the people have increasingly believed that the People's Government stands on the side of the people and is determined to eliminate the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Therefore, before Chairman Mao issued the call last December, many masses had spontaneously begun to fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in various ways. In the past two years, the national supervisory organs have been increasingly supported by the masses in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and the proportion of readers' letters to national newspapers has gradually increased in this regard, which are all manifestations of the broad masses of people's intolerance of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The Northeast Administrative Region began peaceful construction a year earlier than Guan Nei. The people have a particularly deep feeling about the harm caused by corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to the country, that is, to the people themselves. Therefore, the organized and led anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched several months earlier than Guan Nei. The complete consistency of the people's regime and the people is the most important foundation for the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to succeed. It is completely wrong to fail to see the changes in the political attitudes of the broad masses of people after the victory of the revolution, and to look at new problems with conservative and vulgar old views.
    Secondly, there are the conditions of the cadres. Without a doubt, before the launch of this movement, a considerable number of cadres were eroded by bourgeois ideology to varying degrees. They did not remember Chairman Mao's instructions, and did not pay enough attention to the erosive effect of bourgeois ideology in the new stage of historical development. However, apart from a very small number of irredeemable degenerate elements like Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, the vast majority of party members and cadres and democratic figures have always been loyal to the great motherland and to the people's cause. After Chairman Mao rang the alarm, pointed out the dangers, and explained the interests, they have all been or are being mobilized. The fact that the vast majority of responsible leaders of the central organs in Beijing have publicly and sincerely reviewed their work, criticized their shortcomings or mistakes, and expressed their determination to improve their work in front of the masses is the most powerful proof. With the support of the broad masses and the absolute support of responsible cadres at all levels, this great struggle will definitely be victorious.
    Now this great struggle is still beginning on a nationwide scale. All Communist Party members, all People's Government staff, all commanders, fighters, political workers, and logistics workers of the People's Liberation Army, all components of the People's Democratic United Front, and all patriotic compatriots across the country should unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao, fight in a combat posture, bravely and confidently struggle to completely eliminate the dirty poison left over from the old society such as corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    为深入地普遍地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动而斗争
    （一九五二年一月九日在中央、华北和京津两市的干部大会上所作的报告）
    中央人民政府节约检查委员会主任  薄一波同志们：
    伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，已经在北京和全国逐步开展起来了。这是和抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命同样重要的一个新的有历史意义的革命运动。由于我们的国家是在几千年的封建政权的废墟上新建立起来的，为着保证革命胜利和迎接国家建设的历史任务，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，就成为一个绝不可少的革命运动。我现在还没有可能向同志们报告全国的贪污、浪费和官僚主义的情况，但是，只要看一看中央人民政府所属中央一级的军、政机关从十二月十日到最近为止所初步发现的贪污、浪费、官僚主义的情况，就完全可以明白毛主席在去年十二月向全国号召开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的必要了。
    一、中央各机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的情况
    北京中央机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，是去年十二月十日左右开始的，现在差不多一个月了。在去年十二月三十一日以前，运动一般有了些进展，少数部门发动群众的情况比较良好；但是，就整个情况说来，多数单位对于这个运动的重要意义还是认识不足的，因而对于运动的指导，还没有能够贯彻大张旗鼓、雷厉风行的方针。经过毛主席的指示，从今年元旦起，对于运动不够重视和对于发动群众不够放手的情况才根本转变过来。现在可以说，这个伟大的群众运动在北京中央各机关已经大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地开展起来了，在有些单位已经深入下去了。
    从一个月的运动所发现的材料看，贪污、浪费、官僚主义的现象已经不是个别问题了，已经引起广大的群众的愤慨了。根据不完全的初步材料，在政府系统二十七个单位中发现的贪污人数，共一千六百七十余人。中央公安部行政处处长宋德贵一个人即用造假条子的方法，贪污七亿元，该处副处长刘玉泽受贿一亿四千余万元。中央铁道部卫生局副局长蔓焰与人合伙私买鸦片、私造吗啡一百斤。现宋、刘、蔓三犯均已逮捕法办。浪费的现象发现更多。军委后勤系统和铁路系统一九五一年一年内，因对油槽车处理不当，先后共损失了五千吨汽油，另有二千吨汽油，则因粗枝大叶、缺乏知识把不同的油类混淆了，因而完全失效。中央纺织工业部所属经纬纺织机器厂，政府共投资四千余亿元，主要厂房面积达四十五亩，由于设计不周、施工不善，在工程尚未完成时，该厂房二百八十九根柱子中已有二百八十根不平衡地下沉，现正谋补救办法。人民银行总行视察团到河南视察工作时，人民银行河南省分行用了二亿五千多万元的招待费，招待人员一百多人，用了一百多万元的炮台烟，和一千多斤苹果，一千六百多斤香蕉、梨、糖、瓜子等。违反财政纪律的现象也十分严重。首先是化大公为小公的现象相当普遍，单是中央燃料工业部即达七百三十亿元，虽然其中大部分的用途是正当的，但这种行动却是违法的。从本位主义出发造假账的现象也发现很多。中央重工业部钢铁工业局副局长陆达为太原钢铁厂假造五百零三亿元的开支，陆达已因此被撤职。机关生产在过去曾经有一定的作用，现在则成为破坏财政、腐蚀干部的重要因素之一。刘青山、张子善之所以能够肆无忌惮地实行贪污浪费，天津地委的机关生产就是他们营私舞弊、藏垢纳污的掩护工具。至于专款不专用，对上级财政机关打埋伏，在生活细节上公私不分等，更是常见的现象。
    贪污、浪费和违反财政纪律现象之所以相当普遍存在，是和各单位领导同志的官僚主义作风分不开的。官僚主义是贪污浪费的温床。凡是官僚主义严重的地方，也多半是贪污浪费最厉害的地方。有些领导同志，沾染了官僚主义作风，整天高高在上，形式主义地“签名”“盖章”，对于实际工作和群众情况，既不了解，也不研究。这种作风，对于贪污浪费当然是最有利的条件。另外一些同志，终日忙忙碌碌，辛辛苦苦，但是把自己的精力消耗在一些次要的枝节问题上面，不能掌握住工作的中心、问题的本质，因而仍然对于实际工作和群众生活的真实状况缺乏了解，也就不能够正确地引导群众前进。例如中央贸易部去年向苏联订购治口蹄疫的药品“三”吨，由于拟稿者的官僚主义，误写为“三百”吨，各级审稿、核稿、批准的负责干部，也不加思索，照例签名盖章，结果多买了二百九十七吨。又如中央财政部对全国编余人员多批了二万七千人，结果多付了四百四十八亿元。再如天兰铁路某一段的定线设计，设计工程师们设计了十三条线路，争执了一年之久，没有结果，延误工期，不能及时施工。
    由于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的教育，有些贪污分子已开始觉悟过来，坦白运动已逐渐在北京开展起来。根据政府系统二十四个单位不完全统计，已经有五百五十六个人自动坦白，军委后勤系统已有二百五十人自动坦白。中央财政部工程师夏茂如已自动坦白出五人集体贪污三亿四千万元，他一个人分了一亿一千万元。北京、天津工商界的坦白运动，也正在开展。
    许多铺张浪费、违反财政纪律的工作人员，大多数已经或正在公开进行自我检讨。大多数单位负责同志对于官僚主义作风的检讨，则是空前地普遍，也是空前地深入。
    群众对于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的积极性，也开始发动起来。根据政府系统十八个单位的初步统计，已经有八百二十三人参加检举，被检举的人数，根据二十个单位的不完全统计，共三百二十二人。又根据军委后勤系统初步统计，参加检举者五百六十六人，被检举者三十七人。政务院人民监察委员会的监察通讯员，在这个时期也开始活跃，前说的蔓焰案就是监察通讯员石新恩同志检举的。中央劳动部的监察通讯员许义舟同志检举了该部一个负责人曾冒领经费二亿四千余万元，作为本机关改善设备和生活之用。群众性的检举运动，今后必须用一切方法开展起来。
    二、反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的性质
    从上面的情况看来，贪污、浪费、官僚主义的现象，在中国共产党组织内、在人民政府内部、在人民革命军事委员会系统内部、在人民群众团体内部，都是严重的。这种现象如果不加以反对和克服，对于中国共产党和各民主党派，对于中央人民政府和各级地方政府，对于整个人民解放军，对于我们国家的经济、文化事业，对于一切人民团体，都是很大的危险。
    这种危险，表现在经济和政治两个方面。大家最容易感觉到的，首先是在经济方面。贪污、浪费、官僚主义在经济方面对于我们最大的危害，是大量地浪费我们建设国家最宝贵的资金，和败坏我们国家的经济建设事业。从中央人民政府成立以来，我们国家已经有很大量的资金被贪污被浪费了。现在也还有很大量的资金被贪污和浪费着。这种情况，如果不能彻底改变，必然还有更大量的资金被贪污掉和浪费掉。资金对于我们的国家有什么样的作用呢？在革命胜利之后，在建设国家的政治条件已经具备之后，资金就是建设国家的基本条件。没有足够的资金，我们的国家是永远不可能工业化的。就是说，革命虽然胜利了，如果没有必要的资金，我们就不可能建设新民主主义的经济，更谈不到社会主义和共产主义的前途。我们国家资金的来源，在目前还是很困难的。帝国主义、地主阶级和官僚资产阶级所统治的旧中国，是一个落后的农业国家。因而我们现在积累工业化的资金，也只能首先主要由农业来积累，然后逐步增加工业的积累。由农业来积累资金，比工业积累要迟缓得多。因此，我们国家现有的资金和国家经济建设的需要，矛盾是很大的。就是说：我们国家现在所能积累起来的、使用于经济建设的资金的数量，远远落后于国家建设的需要，必须十分珍惜地十分节约地使用。就在这种情况下面，大量的资金被贪污掉了，被浪费掉了。其结果是什么呢？没有别的，就是必然推迟我们国家建设的进行。贪污、浪费、官僚主义所造成的经济方面的损失，不仅在于资金方面，而且往往使许多已经进行的建设事业，遭受严重的损伤。许多工矿企业因此减弱了生产能力，或者缩短了寿命。
    贪污、浪费、官僚主义在政治方面的危险，就在于使我们党、政、军、民的干部，逐渐被腐蚀，因而脱离实际，脱离群众，直至脱离革命。这种情况，也必然为反革命分子造成极大的空隙。历史经验证明：凡是贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象严重的地方，必然是反革命分子容易隐藏的地方。而且革命干部一旦蜕化成为贪污腐化分子的时候，在政治上也就发生了被反革命分子利用、收买的危险。所以，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的问题，不是一个普通的问题，而是关系于革命成败，关系于全党、全军、全体政府工作人员和全体人民的根本大问题。如果在这个战线上面我们不能够取得决定性的胜利，我们就不能保证革命的胜利，就不能保证国家建设事业的顺利进行。这是一场关系全局的伟大的政治斗争和经济斗争。在这一个斗争面前，任何地方、任何部门、任何个人，如果采取麻痹观望的官僚主义态度，必然要犯严重的错误。
    当然，目前全国的贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象，和国民党反动政府时期是不能同日而语的。国民党反动政府本身就是一个贪污、浪费、官僚主义的大集团。在那个反动政府下面，贪污、浪费、官僚主义是只会发展而永远不可能消灭的。而我们的中央和各级人民政府，却是我国历史上空前廉洁的政府，我们的绝大多数工作人员，都是过着清苦的生活，忠心耿耿地为人民服务的。但是为什么贪污、浪费、官僚主义的现象在我们党内、人民政府内部、人民解放军内部和人民团体内部，仍然比革命胜利以前的解放区时期严重了呢？是不是我们的党、政府、军队和人民团体的质量在胜利以后反而退步了呢？是不是我国的贪污、浪费、官僚主义的现象就连我们也不能扑灭呢？毫无疑问，我们不是退步了，而是进步了，贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象，不是比国民党统治时期扩大，也不是和那时一样，而是缩小得多，只是比革命胜利以前的解放区却是发展了。问题的严重性，也就在这里。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，中国共产党和中央人民政府在毛主席的英明领导下，曾经团结全国人民在政治、军事、经济、文化、外交各个战线上取得了辉煌的、伟大的胜利。到现在为止，中国几千年来的封建制度，基本上被推翻了；帝国主义和国民党匪帮所散布的数量庞大的残余的反革命势力基本上被摧毁了；世界上最后一个强大的美帝国主义，在朝鲜所发动的、首先以侵略朝鲜和中国为目的的侵略战争，已经基本上被击败了；国民党反动统治遗留给我们的通货膨胀、物价波动，已经被克服了；衰败的工农业生产，已经大体接近过去最高的水平，并且部分地超过了。这些，是无可争辩的历史性的胜利。如果我们的党、我们的政府、我们的人民解放军、我们的人民民主统一战线，基本上不是廉洁的、健康的、强大的、正确的，就不可能取得这些胜利。我们现在之所以能够在全国范围内，在党、政、军、民各个系统中，坚决地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，也就是因为我们的党，我们的政府、我们的军队、我们的人民民主统一战线基本上是廉洁的、健康的、强大的、正确的的原故。
    在我们的革命队伍中，贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象之所以仍然存在，而且比胜利以前的解放区时期有了发展，有两方面的原因。在一方面，是因为在革命胜利之后，大量抱着旧思想、旧作风而又没有来得及改造的旧的反动政府的工作人员加入到人民政府和国营企业中来了。在另一方面，也是更重要的一方面，却是因为在革命胜利之后，在和平环境中，我们党内、政府内、军队内、人民民主统一战线内，许多同志，特别是许多领导同志没有充分警惕资产阶级思想对于革命的侵蚀作用。在新民主主义革命时期，民族资产阶级在政治上和经济上都有相当的地位，起着一定的作用，这个阶级是在工人阶级领导之下合法存在的。民族资产阶级在新民主主义时期，在承认工人阶级领导，承认国营经济领导的原则下，在自己的经营中取得一定的利润，也是允许的。中国资产阶级在中华人民共和国成立以来，在供给国家和人民以必需品、在抗美援朝和捐献飞机大炮、在纳税等方面，曾经作了相当的努力，也是应当承认的。但是，资产阶级的剥削群众、不劳而食、损人利己、唯利是图、假公济私、投机取巧、铺张浪费、享乐至上等腐化堕落思想，对于革命和建设事业，却是极端有害的。在人民民主统一战线内，上述的资产阶级思想，只能是批评改造的对象，而不能听其自由传播，为害国家。特别不能允许这种腐化堕落的思想在共产党内、在工人阶级内部、在人民政府内部、在人民解放军内部、在国营企业内部、在人民民主统一战线的领导部门内传播，只有这样，才能保持领导部门和革命队伍内部的纯洁。在社会上，这种腐化堕落思想也应受到严正的批判。因为只有这样，才能使工人阶级通过新民主主义时期的改革和建设，进一步领导革命走向社会主义。
    资产阶级腐化堕落思想对于革命的危险性，毛主席和党的中央早已预先见到了。当一九四九年三月全国革命胜利快要到来的时候，毛主席曾经指出：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”但是，有不少的同志，没有细心体会毛主席在这个问题上的英明指示，他们在自己所领导的党组织内、军队内、政府机关内、国营企业内、人民团体内，放任资产阶级的这种糖衣炮弹到处进攻。甚至把糖衣炮弹作为滋补的圣药。结果，在他们的领导下，某些干部被腐蚀了，某些组织被涣散了，甚至于某些领导同志本身，也在不同的程度上被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹打中了。像刘青山、张子善这种人，就被糖衣炮弹彻底毁灭了。其他的一些人，在入城以后，也在许多方面向资产阶级的坏作风学习。例如在建筑问题上，追求外表，讲究形式，而不提倡朴素、经济、坚固、耐久的作风；在贸易方面，不是考虑政策、爱护资材，而是讲究请客、送礼、私人拉拢；在生活上，不是提倡简朴刻苦，而是学习铺张享乐。有个别高级干部甚至于说：“吃饱、睡好，完成任务”！因此，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，本质上就是反对资产阶级腐化堕落思想的斗争，也就是对于资产阶级在三年以来向着工人阶级和中国共产党所举行的猖狂进攻，来一个坚决的反攻，把这种反动的进攻压下去，并把资产阶级的这种反动的丑恶的思想和行为给以政治上的改造和法律上的制裁。只有这样，革命胜利才能有保证。这是一场严重的阶级斗争，我们必须在这场斗争中取得胜利。
    三、反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的方针和政策
    北京中央各机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，大体说来，现在基本上已经发动起来了，绝大部分首长们都作了检讨，坦白和检举运动已初步发动起来。特别在新年以后一周内，运动发展更为迅速。这是很好的现象。但是，运动的发展还是很不平衡的，多数的单位运动还没有深入，也还不够普遍。有少数单位的领导同志自我检讨还很不深刻，因而还没有能够有效地发动群众。有些单位领导的检讨，虽然比较深刻，但中层领导干部还没有认真的自我检讨。也有少数单位，把自上而下的检讨运动停留在党内，还没有迅速和广大群众见面。另外，有少数单位、或者一个单位中的少数部门，他们觉得他们那里没有发生贪污、浪费、官僚主义的可能，他们还没有深刻了解这个运动的伟大意义。所有这些不能令人满意的现象，必须彻底改正。各单位的负责同志和共产党的组织必须保证于最短期内把群众充分发动起来，务必使这一运动深入到每一个角落。要使每一个共产党员、人民政府工作人员、人民解放军的指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员，和后勤工作人员、人民民主统一战线每一个组成部分，都受到这个革命运动的锻炼和教育。凡是抵抗这个运动的人，应当和中央交通部办公厅主任张文昂一样，立即给以撤职处分。
    根据一个月来的经验，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动能否开展和深入的关键，首先在于各单位的首长们能否以身作则，带头检讨，只要首长在群众面前的检讨作好了，群众就一定能够很快地热烈地发动起来。首长检讨之后，各级负责干部，均应逐级地在群众面前检讨，不能有任何例外。各级负责干部的检讨，应当尽可能迅速地和群众见面，把群众斗争的锋芒，引导到、集中到反贪污、反浪费和反官僚主义上去，不应当在党内转小圈子。因为反对贪污、浪费、官僚主义的问题，不仅仅是中国共产党党内的问题，是全体人民共同的要求，共产党员在这个问题上只有更加严格的责任。党员不仅应当受党内的监督，还应当受群众的监督。个别单位在运动中发生了领导干部不团结的现象，个别负责干部对这样严肃的革命斗争加了一些私人意气进去，因而使领导同志的检讨不能在群众中起有力的模范的带头作用，反而影响了群众的情绪，混乱了群众斗争的目标。这种现象必须立即纠正，否则对这种问题应该负责的干部，就要受到组织纪律的处分。为了充分发动群众，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的总方针下，各单位的领导同志不应该主观地限制群众运动的范围。各单位的情况不同，运动的重点在某些部分可能是不一样的，但有什么弊病就应当反对什么，什么弊病最突出，群众自然要求首先反对什么，这里绝对不能限制群众的斗争。有些单位明明是官僚主义最严重，但领导同志却只许群众反贪污、反浪费；也有些单位，明明是贪污最严重，却只许群众首先反浪费；也有些单位，目前只准群众反贪污，不准开展反浪费和反官僚主义的斗争；所有这些，都是错误的。所有企图限制群众、躲避斗争的负责人，都应当立刻在群众面前作公开的检讨，并公开纠正自己的错误作法。
    一切贪污行为，都是犯法的，都应当按情节轻重分别受到适当处分。但是一切贪污分子，除罪大恶极者外，如能作自动的彻底的坦白，则重者可以酌予减罪，轻者可以免予治罪。如果在自己坦白之外，还能检举其他贪污分子，则可视其情况将功折罪。一般贪污分子应当迅速分清是非，消除顾虑，不应当以为坦白之后即丧失了政治前途。因为贪污的本身已经使贪污分子失去了前途，如果坦白自新，仍有一定的前途。有些人怕坦白之后受处分。他们不知道贪污必受处分，坦白则视其情况可以酌予减罪或免罪。有些人怕追赃。当然，贪赃必须追还，但对坦白者的退赃办法，可以视情况酌量办理。
    一切犯法的工商业者，应当限期向政府坦白。应当在工商界中开展一个反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗窃国家资财、反对偷工减料和反对盗窃国家经济情报的斗争。必须知道：贿赂国家工作人员，偷税漏税，在和国家进行交易时用各种欺骗方法盗窃国家资财，在承受国家委托加工、承受订货或承受修建工程时偷工减料，以贱报贵，以坏作好，以及从国家工作人员手中盗窃经济情报等等，都是旧社会遗留下来的卑劣作风，是违反新中国法纪的罪恶行为，是人民政府所绝对不能容许的。凡属有上述犯法行为的工商业者，应当据实向政府坦白，公开声明悔过，保证以后不再发生同样的错误。政府对于犯法的工商业者，除罪大恶极者外，凡能自动彻底坦白的，也可以视情况酌予减罪或免罪。一切偷税漏税的行为，必须制止。已偷漏者应补交，不坦白者补交之外，并应受罚。
    一切违反财政纪律的工作人员，无论是化大公为小公、虚报浮领、对上级财政机关打埋伏、专款不专用、超制度支出、公私不分等，应一律迅速进行清理，忠实地详细地说明情况，听候处理。其中如有贪污行为者，按贪污办理。一切机关生产，应迅速清理账目，听候处理。在清理过程中，绝对不许有破坏、偷盗、分散资财、抽走人力等行为。
    一切有铺张浪费行为的工作人员，应当在群众面前进行公开检讨。不仅应当揭露浪费的事实，而且应当说明浪费的思想根源，保证不再犯。
    一切犯官僚主义错误的工作人员，应当在群众面前进行公开检讨。情节重大者，如检讨深刻，可以减轻处分。
    为了迅速地彻底地揭露贪污、浪费和官僚主义的严重现象，除了号召贪污分子进行坦白、犯错误分子进行检讨外，应当在全国开展一个群众性的检举运动。只有充分地开展了检举运动，才能使一切贪污浪费和官僚主义的行为失去隐避的地方。也只有在全国人民中、在所有工作人员中培养成功了检举的习惯，才能使具有贪污浪费和官僚主义行为的人们有所戒惧。检举贪污、浪费和官僚主义的行为，和检举反革命分子一样是一种爱国的行为。一切爱国者对于贪污浪费和官僚主义的行为，不应采取自由主义的态度。为了国家和人民的共同利益，一切爱国者应该勇敢地担负起检举的任务。政府对于积极参加检举并卓著成效的人员，决给以精神和物质的奖励。检举的方法，可以根据检举者的自愿，口头的、书面的、具名的和不具名的，公开的和秘密的，都可以。检举的内容，能有完全的材料固然好，有部分的材料、甚至只有若干线索，也可以。对于一切检举的材料，政府当负责加以调查，然后根据确切的事实，决定处理办法，决不诬害好人。政府保证检举者的安全，绝对不许任何人采取报复的行动。凡对检举人员进行报复者，应受严格的处分。全国各地的人民监察机关，均应当设立人民检举接待室，各机关均应设立意见箱，便利检举运动的开展。
    四、为反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的胜利而斗争
    同志们！关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的情况、这个运动的性质、和我们对于这个运动的方针和政策，我都讲过了。我现在来回答另外一个问题，就是这次的运动能不能真正取得胜利的问题。有人认为：贪污、浪费和官僚主义“自古已然”，是旧中国普遍的风气，决不可能在短期内反掉的。毫无疑问：我们是承认贪污、浪费、官僚主义的思想作风，是有广泛的社会基础的。正是因为这样，我们才把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义问题，作为一个严重的政治问题来处理。毛主席之所以发动这个运动，不但是从必要性出发，而且是充分地估计了彻底解决这个问题的可能性的。首先一个有利的条件，就是人民的支持。人民作了国家主人之后，人民的利害和国家的利害统一之后，根据两年多的经验，全国大多数人民对于贪污、浪费和官僚主义的现象不但表示不满，而且愿意和这种现象作坚决斗争了。在新中国，贪污浪费和官僚主义，不是像在反动政权下面那样，人民不能够有反对的自由。人民从两年多的经验中，已经日益相信：人民政府是站在人民方面，决心要铲除贪污浪费和官僚主义现象的。所以，在去年十二月毛主席发出号召以前，已有许多群众用各种方法，自发地开始了反对贪污、浪费和官僚主义的斗争。两年来，国家监察机关在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中日益受到群众的拥护，全国报纸的读者来信逐渐地增加了这一方面的比重，都是广大的人民群众对于贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象不能容忍的表现。东北大行政区比关内早一年开始和平建设，人民对于贪污、浪费、官僚主义所给予国家、也就是人民本身的危害，感觉也特别深切，因而有组织有领导的反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动，也比关内早几个月开展起来。人民政权和人民的完全一致，是反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动一定能够成功的最主要的基础。看不到革命胜利以后广大人民政治态度的变化，用保守的庸俗的旧观点来看新的问题，是完全错误的。
    其次，是干部的条件。毫无疑问，在这一运动发动以前，有相当多的一部分干部是在不同程度上受了资产阶级思想侵蚀的，他们没有记住毛主席的指示，没有在历史向前发展的新阶段中，对资产阶级思想的侵蚀作用，加以足够的警惕。但是，除了极少数的像刘青山、张子善那样的不可挽救的堕落分子而外，绝对大多数的党员和干部以及民主人士对于伟大的祖国、对于人民事业，从来是忠心耿耿的。在毛主席敲了警钟，指出危险，说明利害之后，他们都已经或正在动员起来了。北京中央各机关绝对大多数负责首长都在群众面前公开地诚恳地检讨了自己的工作，批评了自己的缺点或错误，表示了改进工作的决心，就是最有力量的证明。有了广大群众的拥护，又有各级负责干部的绝对支持，这一伟大斗争是一定能够胜利的。
    现在这一伟大斗争在全国范围内还正在开始。全体共产党员，全体人民政府工作人员，全体人民解放军的指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员，人民民主统一战线的一切组成部分，全国的一切爱国同胞，都应当团结起来，在毛主席领导下，以战斗的姿态，勇敢地充满信心地为彻底消灭贪污、浪费、官僚主义这些旧社会遗留下来的污毒而斗争。
