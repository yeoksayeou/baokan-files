    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Wang Canwen, an employee of the Managerial Office of the East China Industrial Department, colluded with other employees (such as Wang Er’ye, a staff member of the procurement section of the supply group; Yang Guangyuan, a staff member of the Shanghai operations group stationed at the Managerial Office of the Central South Industrial Department; and Lu Kang, an engineer from the East China Regional Company of the China Grain Company) and illegal merchants Li Jiping and Wang Chunping (Wang Canwen’s elder brother, who once served as a lieutenant of the transport vehicle company of the pseudo-Kuomintang army), to conduct organized embezzlement activities, with a total of 2 billion yuan embezzled. In the spring of 1951, this matter was discovered by the East China Industrial Department and solved by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau. The East China and Central South People's Supervisory Committees and relevant departments organized a joint inspection and proposed a handling plan: dismiss Wang Canwen, Song Liansheng, Yang Guangyuan, and Wang Er’ye from their positions and transfer them to the judicial organs for handling according to law; and give the relevant illegal merchants the punishment they deserve. The Central People's Government Government Administration Council People's Supervisory Committee has approved the handling opinions of East China and Central South.

    Wang Canwen comes from a landlord family, was trained in the Kuomintang Foreign Affairs Bureau translator training class, and worked as a translator for the U.S. military. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as an engineer in the Electrical Industry Management Office of the Kuomintang Resources Committee. He was retained after liberation.

    In the autumn of 1950, in order to improve the quality standards of products from various electrical and mechanical factories in East China, the East China Industrial Department designated the Managerial Office to set up a Diamond Testing Institute and transferred Wang Canwen to be in charge of electrical inspection. The main equipment and materials of the Diamond Testing Institute were mostly allocated at a discounted price by the East China Branch of the National Materials Clearing and Distribution Committee, and some were purchased from the market. At this time, Wang Canwen, relying on his technical knowledge and familiarity with the material situation of the East China Branch, colluded with Wang Er’ye, a staff member of the procurement section of the Managerial Office’s supply group, and some illegal hydro-electrical firms to embezzle and steal state property. His main crimes are as follows:

    After Wang Canwen extracted a complete set of equipment from the East China Branch of the National Materials Clearing and Distribution Committee, he stole and disassembled important parts, disguised them, and then sold them to his own organization at high prices. For example, he removed eleven overload relays, five power factor meters, one frequency meter, and one resistance-inductance phase splitter from the distribution board box, colluded with Hua’an Electric Firm, and sold them to the Managerial Office, stealing 87 million yuan. He colluded with Suixing Hydro-electrical Firm to sell thirty stolen cast iron cable connectors to the Managerial Office, stealing 43.5 million yuan. These two items alone amounted to 130.5 million yuan in stolen state property. After that, Wang Canwen became even more daring and, when looking at materials in the branch warehouse based on the Managerial Office's material application form, he would privately purchase those with excellent quality and low price and conceal the receipts. For example, he secretly purchased three sets of 3,000 kVA new lightning arresters and two sets of 3,500 kVA lightning arresters, as well as one current transformer iron ring, spending only 3.6 million yuan, while the market value was 95 million yuan.

    After Wang Canwen used the above methods and other means to steal a large amount of state property, he further engaged in organized and large-scale embezzlement and theft. First, he joined forces with Yang Guangyuan (from a landlord family, once an assistant engineer at the Xijing Power Plant of the pseudo-Resources Committee), a staff member of the Shanghai operations group stationed at the Managerial Office of the Central South Industrial Department, and illegal merchants Wang Chunping and Li Jiping, an auctioneer and dentist, to buy four bungalows at No. 3, Lane 1208, Liyang Road, Shanghai, as an embezzlement agency and warehouse. Wang Chunping acted as "manager," and Wang Canwen and Yang Guangyuan acted as "technical directors." They bought a large number of used electrical goods from Ruihe Auction House and Qingdao and other places, designed and modified them, impersonated new goods, and sold them to the East China and Central South Industrial Departments at high prices (the materials sold to the Central South Industrial Department involved another case). For example, Wang Canwen sold a single-phase oil-immersed transformer to the East China Industrial Department for 24 million yuan, while the purchase price of the used goods, including painting and repair costs, was only 5.26 million yuan. This one item alone generated a profit of 400 percent. In addition to Wang Er'ye and Lu Kang from the China Grain Company East China Regional Company (who had served as a commissioner of the pseudo-Civil Food Adjustment Committee), Wang Zhiwen, the head of the processing section of the same enterprise (who had served as deputy manager of the pseudo-Shanghai Cereals Company and commissioner of the pseudo-Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee), and several people from Wansheng Iron Factory and China Diesel Engine Company participated in this theft organization. Yang Guangyuan also colluded with Song Liansheng, the manager of the Nanchang Hydroelectric Company under the Central South Industrial Department, and more than ten others to engage in theft activities. For example, Yang Guangyuan and Song Liansheng used 60 million yuan of public funds to buy thirty-six 3,000 kVA lightning arresters from Shenchang Foreign Firm and then sold them to the Nanchang Hydroelectric Company at fifteen times the price. Together with another two sets of purchased equipment, they stole a total of 600 to 700 million yuan. Lu Kang colluded with the head of the processing section, Wang Zhiwen, and unscrupulous merchants to steal and sell materials, embezzling 42 taels of gold and 35 million yuan in RMB.

    The illegal activities of embezzlers like Wang Canwen are extremely vile and shameless. They adopted the method of "four-party joint venture" and "clearing accounts each time." For each embezzlement transaction, Wang Canwen, Yang Guangyuan, Wang Chunping, and Li Jiping each contributed one share, and each received a share of the profits from the embezzlement. They embezzled and sold once, and divided the spoils once. The conspiracy behind their adoption of this method was to "act quickly to avoid leaks" and "in case of discovery, some (loot) could be retained." In addition to this, Wang Canwen and Yang Guangyuan each developed their own embezzlement "routes," which were unrelated to the "four-party joint venture."

    When Wang Canwen's embezzlement was discovered, the higher authorities talked to him, but he escaped and was later captured by the Public Security Bureau. Important stolen goods were found in Wang Canwen's home at No. 4, Lane 1208, Liyang Road, and in four other secret warehouses, such as twenty pieces of power generation equipment (totaling 120 kilowatts, equivalent to the power generation capacity of a medium-sized city), a large number of electrical equipment, 63 taels of gold, 50 U.S. dollars, and nearly 200 million yuan in cash, with stolen money deposited in seven accounts in four banks under assumed names. Together with the above-mentioned embezzled funds of Wang Canwen, the total value was 2 billion yuan in RMB.

    The main reason why Wang Canwen and others committed the above-mentioned crimes of embezzlement is that they mostly came from exploiting classes and had long worked in Kuomintang reactionary organs, which cultivated their strong bourgeois exploitative ideology and stealing habits. For example, when Wang Canwen worked as a translator for the U.S. military, he met auctioneer Li Jiping and jointly stole and sold materials with American soldiers; when he was at the Joint Office of various Shanghai power plants, he fraudulently claimed materials from the Maigen Road warehouse. After he was retained, he appeared outwardly active, often voluntarily doing other people's work and not taking overtime pay for working night shifts. In secret, however, he was systematically and deliberately carrying out embezzlement. For example, the Diamond Testing Institute was originally scheduled to be completed in November 1950, but Wang Canwen deliberately delayed it until March 1951 in order to arrange embezzlement and theft schemes, delaying the inspection work by four months, and the losses were incalculable. During the testing period, he systematically colluded with illegal manufacturers. For example, the motor from Hua’an Factory was originally unqualified, but he changed it to qualified as an exchange condition for Hua’an Factory to issue invoices when stealing equipment. In order to cover up his embezzlement and theft activities, he did not immediately indulge in extravagant spending with his ill-gotten gains but instead constantly pretended to be poor. For one month, he deliberately did not pay half a month's worth of meal expenses, saying that he was short on cash. He was thus deliberately carrying out illegal activities to fulfill his shameless ambitions. As he confessed to the Public Security Bureau, "I embezzled in order to lay a foundation for my own career (!)."

    Another reason why Wang Canwen embezzled was that he misinterpreted the government's policy of respecting and uniting technical personnel, mistakenly believing that "I am indispensable" and that it would be okay to do some bad things, which led to the point where he used his technology to commit anti-people crimes. For example, when he was at the Diamond Testing Institute, he deliberately designed complex circuits and was unwilling to hand over the drawings when he was transferred, in order to boast of his abilities. When he was arrested, he blindly and arrogantly argued, "I am a graduate of Jiaotong University, an engineer, and have been working in society for many years. You should be careful with technical personnel and not make mistakes, otherwise the political impact will be bad!" Later, when the evidence was conclusive and he could not deny it, he still said, "Although I embezzled, I am still good at technology."

    The bureaucratic work style of the leadership and some serious loopholes in the work system also gave Wang Canwen and others an opportunity to take advantage of. The material extraction forms from the warehouse of the East China Materials Clearing and Distribution Committee lacked precise specifications. For example, the extraction form only stated "one set of distribution board box, incomplete," etc., without specifying the extent of incompleteness. As a result, no one knew that Wang Canwen had stolen eleven overload relays from the distribution board box and sent it to the Managerial Office. For example, some personnel of the Diamond Testing Institute handed over all the work of viewing materials, extracting materials, delivering materials, and accepting goods to Wang Canwen alone to "do it for them." Wang Canwen was able to take advantage of the opportunity to go to the warehouse to view materials, stealing and selecting goods of excellent quality and low price, and was able to deliver important equipment to his own home or secret warehouse after extracting them. In this way, the theft was unimpeded. The person in charge of the Diamond Testing Institute and the person in charge of the inspection team of the Managerial Office, who were responsible for leading the Diamond Testing Institute, did not understand the situation of Wang Canwen's purchase, extraction, and acceptance of materials beforehand and did not inspect afterwards, simply "stamping" the documents, which also showed a very serious bureaucratic work style. In particular, after the person in charge of the Diamond Testing Institute noticed Wang Canwen's illegal behavior, he neither stopped it nor reported it, adopting an attitude of "being a good person" and "his embezzlement has nothing to do with me," ignoring it. As a result, Wang Canwen dared to use the institute's cars and drivers on Sundays or after work to move machines in and out on a large scale, stealing materials.

    华东、中南工业部经理处职员王灿文等
    集体贪污廿亿元已撤职依法严惩
    中央人民监察委员会同意华东、中南监察机关处理方案
    【本报讯】华东工业部经理处职员王灿文勾结其他职员（如供应组采购股职员王尔烨，中南工业部经理处驻沪营运组职员杨光远，中国粮食公司华东区公司工程师卢康）和不法商人李寄萍、王纯平（王灿文的胞兄，曾任伪国民党军辎重汽车连连长）等，有组织地进行贪污活动，贪污所得共值二十亿元。一九五一年春天，这件事经华东工业部发觉，上海市人民政府公安局侦讯破获。业经华东、中南人民监察委员会和有关部门组织联合检查，并提出处理方案：撤消王灿文、宋廉生、杨光远、王尔烨的职务，并移交司法机关依法处理；对有关不法商人等也给以应得处罚。中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会已同意华东、中南的处理意见。
    王灿文是地主成份，曾受国民党外事局翻译人员训练班训练，当过美军翻译。抗日战争结束后，任国民党资源委员会电业管理处工务员。解放后留用。
    一九五零年秋天，华东工业部为提高华东各电器机械厂产品的品质标准，指定经理处筹设金刚试验所，调王灿文为电气检验主管人。金刚试验所主要设备器材，大部是由全国物资清理调配委员会华东分会折价拨给，部分从市上购买。这时，王灿文凭自己懂得技术，对华东分会物资情况较为熟悉，就勾结了经理处供应组采购股职员王尔烨和一些不法水电行，贪污舞弊，窃取国家资财。其主要罪行如下：
    王灿文向全国物资清理调配委员会华东分会提取整套器材后，盗拆重要零件，改头换面，再以高价卖给本机关。如把配电表板箱上的过载继电器十一只，电力因数表五只，周率表一只，电阻电感分相器一只拆下，串通华安电器行，卖给经理处，盗得八千七百万元。串通燧兴水电行，把盗窃的生铁电缆结合器三十只卖给经理处，盗得四千三百五十万元。这两项，就窃取了国家资财一亿三千零五十万元。之后，王灿文贼胆更大，凭经理处物资申请单到分会仓库看料时，发现品优价廉的，就自己出钱窃购，把回执隐没。如窃购三千伏安新避雷器三套，三千五百伏安避雷器两套，量流体铁环一只，只出了三百六十万元，而市价值九千五百万元。
    王灿文运用上述方式和其他办法窃取国家大量资财后，就进一步有组织地、大规模地贪污盗窃。首先和中南工业部经理处驻沪营运组职员杨光远（地主成份，曾任伪资源委员会西京电厂助理工程师）、不法商人王纯平、拍卖商兼牙医生李寄萍三人，合伙在上海市溧阳路一二○八弄三号买了平房四间，作为贪污机构和货栈，并由王纯平作“经理”，王灿文、杨光远作“技术指导”。他们从瑞和拍卖行和青岛等地，买进大批电器旧货，设计改装，冒充新货，高价卖给华东和中南工业部（卖给中南工业部的物资，涉及另外一个案件）。如王灿文把单相油浸变压器一只卖给华东工业部，价为两千四百万元，其买进的旧货价格连喷漆修装费在内，只有五百二十六万元。只这一项就获暴利达百分之四百。这个盗窃机构除王尔烨、中国粮食公司华东区公司卢康（曾任伪民食调剂委员会专员）参加外，卢康又勾结了本企业的加工科科长王志文（曾任伪上海中粮公司副经理及伪粮食紧急购储委员会专员）和万盛铁工厂，中国柴油机公司的若干人员。杨光远也串通了中南工业部所属南昌水电公司经理宋廉生等十多人进行盗窃活动。如杨光远和宋廉生以公款六千万元，向慎昌洋行买得三千伏安避雷器三十六只，以十五倍高价再卖给南昌水电公司，连同另外二件套买器材，前后共窃得人民币六、七亿元。卢康和加工科长王志文勾结奸商盗卖资材，贪污黄金四十二两、人民币三千五百万元。
    王灿文等贪污分子的非法活动是极端恶劣和无耻的，他们采取了“四股联营”、“次次清账”的办法。作一次盗窃买卖，王灿文、杨光远、王纯平、李寄萍四人就各出一股，盗卖获利各得一份。盗卖一次，分赃一次。他们采取这一办法的阴谋是“迅速行事，避免走漏”，“万一发觉，也可保留一部（赃物）”。除此以外，王灿文、杨光远又各人发展贪污“路线”，与“四股联营”不发生关系。
    当王灿文贪污事实被发觉时，上级找他谈话，他竟逃跑，后被公安局捕获，并在溧阳路一二○八弄四号王灿文家里及其他四处秘密仓库中抄出重要赃物；如发电设备等机器二十部（合计动力一百二十瓩，相等于一个中等城市的发电量），大批电机器材，黄金六十三两，美钞五十元，现钞近二亿，分存四个银行的化名存户赃款七户。连同上面王灿文贪污资财总计值人民币二十亿元。
    王灿文等产生上述贪污罪行的原因，主要因为他们大都是剥削阶级出身，过去长期在国民党反动派机关里作事，养成了浓厚的资产阶级剥削思想意识和盗窃习惯。如王灿文在美军做翻译时，就结识了拍卖商李寄萍，和美国兵共同盗卖物资；在伪上海各电厂联合办事处时，向麦根路仓库冒领物资。在他被留用以后，表面上装得积极，经常主动地代作别人的工作，作夜班不拿加班费。暗地里却有计划有步骤地进行贪污勾当。如金刚试验所原定一九五零年十一月筹备完成，但王灿文为布置贪污和窃取阴谋，故意拖迟到一九五一年三月，使检验工作迟延四月，损失无法计算。试验期间，有计划地勾结不法厂商，如华安厂的马达本来不合格，他就改为合格，作为盗窃器材时要华安厂代开发票的交换条件。为了掩盖贪污盗窃活动，他把贪污所得，不立刻滥吃滥用，反而处处哭穷，有一个月，他故意不付半月的饭钱，说是手头紧。他是这样处心积虑地进行非法活动，以遂其无耻的野心。正如他在公安局招供时说：“我贪污就是为了想替自己的事业（！）打下一个基础。”
    王灿文产生贪污的另一个原因，是他曲解了政府尊重和团结技术人员的政策，错误地认为“非我不可”，作点坏事也没有关系，以致发展到利用技术进行反人民罪行。如他在金刚试验所时故意设计复杂路线，调动工作时不愿交出图样，借以夸耀自己本领。被捕时还盲目自大地抗辩说：“我是交通大学毕业生，工程人员，在社会上已服务了好几年，对技术人员你们要慎重些，不要弄错了，否则政治影响不好啊！”后来罪证确凿，无法抵赖时，他还说：“虽然我贪污，但在技术上我还是不错的。”
    领导方面的官僚主义作风和工作制度中的若干严重的漏洞，也给王灿文等以可乘之机。华东物资清理调配委员会仓库，提取物资单无精确规格，如提单中只写着“配电表板箱一具，不全”等等，不全到如何程度，却没有写明。因之，王灿文把配电表板箱上的过载继电器盗拆十一只后送给经理处，也没有人知道。如金刚试验所的若干人员，把看料、提料、送料、验收等工作，全部交给王灿文一人“代劳”，王灿文就能假借到仓库里看料的机会，偷盗选择品优价廉的货品，就能把重要器材提取后送到自己家里或秘密仓库。这样，使盗窃行为，通行无阻。而金刚试验所的负责人和负责领导金刚试验所的经理处检验组负责人，对王灿文请购、提料、验收情况，事先不了解，事后不检查，“盖章”了事，也有十分严重的官僚主义作风。尤其是金刚试验所负责人察觉王灿文有不法行为后，既不制止，也不报告，以“作好人”，“他贪污同我无关”的态度置之不理。致使王灿文胆敢在星期日或下班后，利用所里的汽车和司机，大规模地把机件装进装出，盗窃物资。
