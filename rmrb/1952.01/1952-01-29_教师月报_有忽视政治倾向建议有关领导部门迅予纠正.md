    "Teacher's Monthly" Neglects Political Tendencies; Suggests Relevant Leadership Departments Promptly Rectify

    Editor: After reading the first issue of the 1952 "Teacher's Monthly" distributed by the Beijing Dazhong Bookstore, I feel that this publication, which has a considerable circulation, does not pay enough attention to serious political struggles.

    Currently, a great anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is being carried out throughout the country. This is the central task that overrides all others for the people of the whole country, and it is also a political and ideological struggle of great historical significance. In the face of this fierce struggle, all newspapers and publications, large and small, across the country are using their utmost strength to promote this movement and push it towards continuous deepening and victory. However, in the thirty-eight pages of this issue of "Teacher's Monthly," there are less than four pages of articles related to this movement. If we compare the content of these articles with the vigorous struggle situation in various schools in Beijing, it is also extremely disproportionate.

    The erroneous tendency of "Teacher's Monthly" to neglect serious political struggles is not new. "Teacher's Monthly" has consistently lacked due enthusiasm for large-scale political movements such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries in 1951. I have calculated that in the eleven issues of this publication that have been published, there is only one article on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and there are no articles on suppressing counter-revolutionaries at all. I think this deserves serious attention. I hope the relevant leadership departments will quickly rectify this.

### “教师月报”有忽视政治倾向建议有关领导部门迅予纠正

    “教师月报”有忽视政治倾向建议有关领导部门迅予纠正
    编辑同志：我看到北京大众书店发行的一九五二年第一期“教师月报”后，觉得这个具有相当发行规模的刊物，对于严重的政治斗争是重视得不够的。
    目前在全国范围内，正开展着伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。这是全国人民目前压倒一切的中心任务，也是一个有着重大的历史意义的政治斗争和思想斗争。在这个激烈的斗争面前，全国各大小报纸和刊物无不以最大的力量进行宣传，以推动这个运动不断深入和走向胜利。但是，在这期“教师月报”三十八页的篇幅中，有关这个运动的文章却不到四页。如把这些文章的内容和北京市各学校所进行的轰轰烈烈的斗争情况对照一下，也是极不相称的。
    “教师月报”忽视严重的政治斗争的错误倾向，已经不是一次了。“教师月报”在一九五一年对抗美援朝、镇压反革命等大规模的政治运动也一贯缺乏应有的热情。我统计了一下，在这个刊物已经出版的十一期中，关于抗美援朝的文章只有一篇，关于镇压反革命的文章则根本没有。我认为这是值得严重注意的。希望有关领导部门迅速纠正。
