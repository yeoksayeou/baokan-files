    Strengthen Vigilance, Prevent Fire, Prevent Special Agents, Prevent Theft
    ——Reader Letters and Commentary

    Strengthening vigilance and doing a good job in preventing fire, special agents, and theft is extremely important. However, some areas and units still have staff who do not sufficiently recognize the importance of this work. They are satisfied with the achievements in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, believing that "there will be no problems," and that "even if doors are left unlocked at night, nothing unexpected will happen."

    But what are the facts? We can answer this question from the recent reader letters from various places. In December of last year alone, eleven fire incidents occurred in cotton processing factories in only four areas of Jin County, Zhengding, and others in Hebei Province, resulting in a loss of 4,000 jin of cotton. The Potou Township Cooperative in Lingbao County, Henan Province, had a fire in its cotton warehouse in December of last year, burning down three warehouses and 5,000 jin of cotton stored in the warehouses, the cause of the fire is unknown. The Handan Textile Company in Hebei Province had forty bolts of cotton cloth stolen in mid-December of last year. Although the grain warehouse in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, established a warehouse protection organization, it was mostly a formality. Some warehouses had only two or three militiamen on duty each night, simply "inquiring" as if it were the end of the matter. A certain warehouse keeper even used a lottery method to select some ne'er-do-wells and landlords to "protect the warehouse," thus giving special agents and counter-revolutionaries an opportunity to exploit. There are many similar examples to the above. These facts show that some cadres have developed complacency after achieving some success in suppressing counter-revolutionary work.

    Experience tells us that wherever counter-revolutionary elements succeed in their conspiracies, it is often because the local leading cadres lack vigilance and preparedness. All parts of the country must increase vigilance a hundredfold, mobilize the masses, strengthen and earnestly check security work, and must ensure that those hidden counter-revolutionary elements have no opportunity to exploit.

### 加强警惕，防火、防特、防盗——读者来信述评

    加强警惕，防火、防特、防盗
    ——读者来信述评
    加强警惕，做好防火、防特、防盗工作是十分重要的。但目前还有些地区和单位的工作人员，对这一工作的重要性认识不足。他们满足于镇压反革命的成绩，认为“不会有问题了”，“即使夜不闭户，也不致于发生什么意外”。
    但事实是怎样呢？从最近各地读者来信当中，可以回答这一问题。在去年十二月份，只河北省晋县、正定等四个地区的棉花加工厂，就发生失火事件十一起，共损失棉花四千斤。河南省灵宝县坡头乡合作社在去年十二月份棉花仓库着火，烧毁库房三间和存在库房内的棉花五千斤，着火原因不明。河北省邯郸花纱布分公司在去年十二月中旬被盗棉布四十匹。湖南省衡山县粮食仓库虽然成立了护仓组织，但大都流于形式。有的仓库每晚只有两三个民兵，“打听”一下就算了事。某仓库保管人员竟用抽签办法，抽出一些二流子和地主来“护仓”，因此给特务和反革命分子以可乘之机。类似上面的例子还有不少。这些事实说明有些干部在镇压反革命工作取得一些成绩以后，又滋生了麻痹自满情绪。
    经验告诉我们：凡是反革命分子阴谋得逞的地方，往往是当地领导干部缺乏警惕和戒备的。全国各地，必须百倍地提高警惕，发动群众，加强并切实认真地检查保卫工作，必须作到让那些暗藏的反革命分子无隙可乘。
