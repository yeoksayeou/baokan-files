    To accelerate the elimination of illiteracy, the General Political Department recently decided to promote the "Accelerated Literacy Method" throughout the army.

    The "Accelerated Literacy Method" was first created by Comrade Qi Jianhua, a cultural instructor from a certain army unit in the Southwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. Its main spirit is: to use phonetic symbols as an auxiliary tool for literacy, to give play to our army's mass line teaching experience, to adopt practical teaching methods, and to launch a mass literacy campaign. Using the "Accelerated Literacy Method," in about 150 hours of teaching time, general illiterate people and those with limited literacy can initially recognize and speak 1,500 to 2,000 Chinese characters (without phonetic symbols) as a step in language learning. Then, textbooks are taught, reading and writing are organized to gradually consolidate and familiarize themselves with the characters they have learned, further understand the meaning of the words, and improve reading and writing skills to achieve the goal of "four abilities" (recognizing, speaking, writing, and using), striving to be able to read popular publications, write simple application documents, and basically complete the task of eliminating illiteracy.

    According to existing experience, the entire teaching process of the "Accelerated Literacy Method," in addition to ideological mobilization work, can generally be divided into three steps:

    The first step is to learn phonetic symbols and pinyin, and master the auxiliary tools for literacy (soldiers call phonetic symbols "literacy crutches"). Here, the original phonetic symbols are basically used, starting from easy to difficult, first teaching the medial sounds "一 (yi), × (wu), ㄩ (yu)," then teaching the single vowel sounds, then the double vowel sounds, and finally the final sounds. In order to take care of local dialects, the teaching of phonetic symbols does not demand "standard pronunciation" and "four tones," but puts the four tones into "word linking" and the use of words to gradually solve (such as "迂, 鱼, 雨, 遇" all use a "ㄩ" phonetic symbol. It is not easy to distinguish the "four tones" when reading individually, but when linked to "迂回, 捕鱼, 下雨, 遭遇", the meaning of the word is very clear, and there will be no misunderstanding). If taught well, this step can be completed in only 20 to 30 hours.

    The second step is to intensively learn single characters, first seeking to be able to read and initially speak them. Here, we use a "phonetic single-character table" of 2,000 characters as teaching material. This single-character table is composed of all the new words in the first, second, third, and fourth volumes of the primary school Chinese textbooks compiled and printed by the General Political Department, plus several hundred daily-use characters other than the textbooks. Dozens of characters can be taught per hour. If studying all day, about one to two hundred characters can be taught every day, focusing on reading. The explanation of the meaning of the words should be as concise as possible, linking it to things familiar to the students in their actual lives, striving to make the explanation vivid, and vigorously organizing review and mutual assistance, strengthening individual tutoring, so as to gradually get rid of phonetic symbols and recognize the words learned (soldiers call it "dropping crutches" or "moving house"). This step takes about 100 hours.

    The third step is to teach and learn language textbooks, and at the same time carry out a large number of reading, writing, and speaking activities to consolidate the characters learned, and expand the scope of understanding the meaning of the words, so as to be able to write and use them. Here, we should focus on explaining the texts of the first, second, third, and fourth volumes of the primary school Chinese textbooks, conduct specific reading guidance, teach writing, correct wrong characters and typos, learn to use dictionaries, revise compositions, and do the homework stipulated in the textbooks, until basically achieving the requirements for eliminating illiteracy (equivalent to the Chinese language level of an average junior primary school graduate). Since the students already have a foundation of being able to initially recognize and speak 1,500 to 2,000 single characters, this stage of teaching should be enough with about 150 hours of teaching time.

    Over the past year, the practical teaching experience of many units of the People's Liberation Army and some factories has proved that using such a literacy method can accelerate the elimination of illiteracy.

    For example, in the second phase of the accelerated literacy teaching experimental class in the Southwest Military Region, in 30 days of teaching, 73 people who originally recognized an average of 1,009 characters were able to improve to an average of 2,327 characters initially recognized, each person roughly read 30 popular publications and 32 newspapers (approximately 265,000 words), and wrote 22 short articles; 67 people who originally recognized an average of 325 characters were able to improve to an average of 2,084 characters initially recognized, of which 17 people, including Hua Yanlin, who originally recognized 200 characters, initially recognized 2,300 characters, reading political common sense textbooks with only nine new words; 33 people who originally recognized an average of 96 characters were able to improve to an average of 1,395 characters initially recognized.

    The Guizhou Military Region simultaneously used the "Accelerated Literacy Method" for teaching in five companies. In just 15 days, all officers and soldiers, including 144 ethnic minority soldiers (Miao, Yi, Tu, Dong, Shui, and other nine ethnic groups), initially recognized an average of more than 1,500 characters, were able to read the first, second, and third volumes of the primary school Chinese textbooks, and each wrote three short articles.

    After a short period of study, the soldiers began to read ordinary books and newspapers. When they were able to read the news from the Korean front by themselves, their joy was indescribable. Some soldiers, after reading "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," excitedly said: "Now I can even read Chairman Mao's articles!"

    Yang Shaoqing, a worker in Chongqing, shed tears of excitement when he picked up his pen to write a letter. He said: "I haven't studied culture for more than 20 years. I never thought that I could write a letter after studying here (in the accelerated literacy experimental class) for three weeks. I really don't know how to repay Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's kindness!"

    Some comrades ask: Can the characters recognized using this method be consolidated? We say: Yes, there is a danger of not being consolidated. If, after intensively recognizing single characters, the teacher does not organize reading and writing, and does not continue to carry out language teaching with greater effort to further improve reading and writing skills, it cannot be consolidated. However, as long as you read and write often, the single characters recognized intensively can be consolidated. Soldiers have the basis for initially recognizing 1,500 to 2,000 characters, so they can often read books, newspapers, write letters, and write articles, and things that are commonly used are not easy to forget. What is easy to forget are the characters that are not commonly used.

    Comrade Qi Jianhua believes that there is a "three-five concept" in some units' literacy education, where soldiers are only taught three to five characters a day. Although it is easy to learn, it is also easy to forget. The reason is that few new characters are learned, they cannot be used by themselves, and they are forgotten as they are learned, so they become less and less confident, retreat in fear of difficulties, and stop moving forward. Comrade Qi Jianhua advocates first "gobbling up" and then gradually "digesting." He said: "Learning a lot, high morale, able to use, will not forget; learning less, unable to use, less confidence, paralyzed." That is to say: learning a certain number of commonly used characters is easy to apply, so it is not easy to forget; conversely, learning too few characters, you can't read and write at all, hard memorization, you will forget it. He also said: "Teaching more, learning more, remembering more, forgetting a part is certain, but the achievement is definitely great." The "Accelerated Literacy Method" enables students to first intensively recognize 1,500 to 2,000 commonly used characters, which not only meets the soldiers' thirst for learning, but also meets the actual law of enhancing learning effectiveness.

    Comrade Qi Jianhua advocates changing the practice of immediately requiring simultaneous possession of the sound, meaning, and form of a character and being able to apply it when teaching each character. In fact, the foundation of "four abilities" should first lie in recognizing enough single characters and a large number of vocabulary. It is extremely difficult to require mastery and application within the scope of recognizing dozens or hundreds of characters, being able to read, speak, and apply them freely. The "Accelerated Literacy Method" is different. It first enables students to learn a large number of characters "to recognize" and initially learn "to speak", which opens up a broad path for further improving reading and writing skills. On the basis of being able to initially recognize and speak, achieving the goal of "four abilities" can accelerate the progress of "four abilities." Disperse the difficulties of learning writing such as sound, meaning, and form, break them down one by one, and gradually possess them. That is: first rely on phonetic symbols, pinyin, and simple explanation of the meaning of the words, focusing on enabling students to read, and initially speak and familiarize themselves with the form of the characters; then, in teaching language textbooks and widely organizing reading and writing, more firmly possess the sound of the words, more fully understand the meaning of the words, and further achieve writing, and gradually improve the ability to apply them, to meet the requirements of "four abilities". Comrade Qi Jianhua said: "When learning new characters, recognition should be the main thing (not that we don't pay attention to 'four abilities', it's a matter of priority), and 'speaking' and 'writing' are secondary. It's like introducing you to a dozen people at once, you may not remember them all, but you will become familiar with them after seeing them a few more times. After recognizing and speaking many characters, these characters have been seen many times in your eyes, so it will be easier to write them."

    Comrade Qi Jianhua attaches great importance to the consciousness of workers, peasants, revolutionary soldiers in learning, and is good at giving play to the advantages of adults in learning. He knows the soldiers' urgent desire to learn culture, and trusts their courage to overcome difficulties and their combat spirit of hard study and hard practice. He believes that adults have a rich life, a rich language, strong comprehension, and strong association.

    Although individual character shapes are unfamiliar to illiterate adults, in struggle and life, they can easily understand the meaning they represent. The difficulty lies only in their inability to connect the words spoken orally with the words written on paper. Most commonly used characters can be initially understood as long as the sound of the character can be read. With phonetic symbols as "crutches" to assist self-study, with practical teaching methods and mass mutual assistance and tutoring work, it is convenient to memorize and overcome the weakness of "easy to forget," so you can learn more and learn faster. Therefore, in teaching, Comrade Qi Jianhua, while exploring accelerated methods suitable for the characteristics of adults, also paid special attention to carrying out a series of mobilization work on the two questions of "why can it be accelerated" and "how can it be accelerated", to establish learning confidence, and greatly promote the enthusiasm and consciousness of the students.

    Comrade Qi Jianhua avoided the teaching methods of simply injecting and separating from reality, vividly displayed our army's mass line teaching experience, and firmly grasped the teaching principle of linking to reality. This spirit runs through the entire teaching process of the "Accelerated Literacy Method." Comrade Qi Jianhua attaches extreme importance to learning mobilization work. He often said: "If the ideology is clear, the morale is high!" "How to teach, how to learn, listen to learning guidance, the teacher makes guarantees, the learner naturally becomes energetic, determined to study hard, teach where to learn, the thoughts of the teacher and the student must be completely consistent." He can teach from easy to difficult, from shallow to deep, according to the level of the masses, such as he first teaches "－, ㄨ, ㄩ". He does not demand "standard pronunciation" in education, nor does he emphasize immediately solving the "four tones," based on the actual teaching situation and taking care of local dialects. His explanation of the meaning of the words pays attention to linking the vocabulary and things that the soldiers are most familiar with, requiring simplicity and specificity (such as when explaining the word "径" to the soldiers, it is easier to remember when talking about "caliber of the cannon" than talking about "the path of the path"). His explanation strives to be lively and vivid and visual, which can help memory. In the entire teaching process, he can continuously carry out mobilization and encouragement, commend models, promote revolutionary heroism in learning, formulate personal learning plans, organize mutual assistance, go deep into classes and platoons, conduct individual tutoring, and carry out reading, writing, and speaking movements, using oral broadcasting, wall newspapers, singing, literacy games, and other auxiliary teaching.

    The "Accelerated Literacy Method" created by Comrade Qi Jianhua still needs to be developed and improved in many aspects, especially in the language teaching stage after a large number of intensive recognition of single characters, our experience is still very limited. However, repeated practice has proved that there is no doubt about the effect of using the "Accelerated Literacy Method" to accelerate the elimination of illiteracy.

    介绍“速成识字法”
    中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会  总政治部宣传部
    为加速消除文盲，总政治部最近决定在全军推行“速成识字法”。
    “速成识字法”为人民解放军西南军区某军文化教员祁建华同志所首创。其主要精神是：借注音符号为辅助识字的工具，发挥我军群众路线的教学经验，采用联系实际的教学方法，展开群众性的识字运动。运用“速成识字法”，约在一百五十小时左右的教学时间内，可使一般文盲和识字不多的人初步会认、会讲一千五百到两千个汉字（离开注音符号），作为语文学习的一个步骤；尔后再教课本，组织阅读、写作，逐渐巩固与熟练所识的字，进一步了解字义，提高阅读和写作能力，达到“四会”（认、讲、写、用）的目的，求得能阅读通俗读物，写简单的应用文，基本上完成消除文盲的任务。
    根据已有的经验，整个“速成识字法”的教学过程，除思想动员工作外，一般地可分为三个步骤来进行：
    第一步，学会注音符号和拼音，掌握识字的辅助工具（战士称注音符号为“识字拐棍”）。在这里，基本上沿用原有的注音符号，从易到难，先教介符“一（一）、×（屋）、ㄩ（鱼）”，然后教单音声符，再教双音声符，最后教韵符。为照顾各地方言，教注音符号不苛求“标准音”和“四声”，而把四声放到“词儿连读”与字的运用中逐渐去解决（如“迂、鱼、雨、遇”都用一个“ㄩ”字注音，单个地读，不易区别“四声”，但连成“迂回、捕鱼、下雨、遭遇”，词意就很明显，不致于有误会）。如果教得好，这一步骤只需二、三十个小时，就能完成。
    第二步，突击学单字，先求会读与初步会讲。在这里，我们用两千个字的“注音单字表”作教材，这个单字表是以总政治部编印的部队小学国语课本第一、二、三、四册的全部生字，加上课本以外的几百个日常用字组成的。每小时可教几十个字，如果是整天学习，每天可教一、二百字左右，重点在于读。讲解字义则力求简明，联系学员实际生活中熟悉的事物，力求讲解的形象化，并大力组织复习和互助，加强个别辅导，作到逐渐能脱离注音符号，认识所学的字（战士称之为“丢拐棍”或“搬家”）。这一步约需一百多小时的时间。
    第三步，教、学语文课本，同时开展大量的阅读、写字、写话活动，巩固所识的字，并扩大了解字义的范围，作到会写、会用。在这里，应当有重点地讲解部队小学国语课本第一、二、三、四册的课文，进行具体的阅读指导，教写字，纠正错字、别字，学会查字典，修改作文，作好课本所规定的作业，直到基本上达成消除文盲的要求（相当于一般初级小学毕业的语文程度）。由于学员已经具有初步会认、会讲一千五百到二千个单字的基础，这一段的教学，大约再有一百五十小时左右的教学时间就够了。
    一年来，人民解放军不少部队及某些工厂实际教学的经验，证明了运用这样的识字方法，是可以加速消除文盲的。
    例如：西南军区第二期速成识字教学实验班，在三十天教学中，就能使原来平均识一千零九个字的七十三人，提高到平均初步识字二千三百二十七个，每人粗读了三十本通俗读物，三十二份报纸
    （约二十六万五千多字），写话二十二篇；使原来平均识三百二十五个字的六十七人，提高到平均初步识字二千零八十四个，其中原识二百字的华宴林等十七人，初步认识了二千三百个字，阅读政治常识课本，只有九个生字，使原来平均识九十六个字的三十三人，提高到平均初步识字一千三百九十五个。
    贵州军区在五个连队中同时用“速成识字法”进行教学，只十五天的时间，全体干部战士，包括一百四十四个少数民族战士（苗、彝、土、侗家、水家等九族），平均初步识字在一千五百个以上，能读部队小学国语课本第一、二、三册，每人写短稿三篇。
    战士们经过短期的学习，就开始阅读普通书报。当他们自己能够看朝鲜前线的新闻时，他们那种愉快的心情是无法形容的。有的战士读过“论人民民主专政”之后，兴奋地说：“这一下连毛主席的文章我都能读了！”
    重庆的工人杨少卿在提笔写信时，兴奋地流下泪来，他说：“我二十多年没有学过文化，想不到在这里（速成识字实验班）学了三个星期就能写信了，我真不知道怎样报答毛主席、共产党的恩情！”
    有些同志问：用这样的方法所识的字，能巩固吗？我们说：是的，有不巩固的危险。如果突击认识单字之后，教的人不去组织阅读、写话，不用更大的努力去继续进行语文教学，进一步提高阅读写作能力，便不能巩固。但，只要常读、常写，突击认识的单字是可以巩固的。战士们有了初步认识一千五百字到二千字的基础，就能够经常看书、看报、写信、写稿，而常用的东西，是不容易忘的，容易忘的是不常用的字。
    祁建华同志认为有些部队中的识字教育，有一种
    一天只学三、五个字的“三、五观念”，每天只叫战士啃那一两个字，虽然容易学会，但也容易忘掉。原因是学的生字少，自己用不上，边学边忘，就越来越没有信心，畏难退缩，裹足不前。祁建华同志主张先“狼吞虎咽”，再逐渐“消化”。他说：“学的多，情绪高，能够用，不会忘；学的少，无法用，信心少，麻痹了。”就是说：学会一定数量的常用字，便于应用，才不易忘；反之，学的字太少，根本不能阅读和写作，硬记，就硬忘。他又说：“教的多，学的多，记的也多，忘掉一部分是肯定的，但成绩也肯定是大的。”“速成识字法”能使学员首先突击认识一千五百到二千个常用字，这既符合于战士的如饥如渴的学习要求，也符合于增强学习效果的实际规律。
    祁建华同志主张改变那种每教一字便立即要求同时占有字音、字义、字形，并能应用的作法。事实上，“四会”的基础，首先应在于认得足够的单字和较多的词汇。要求在认得几十个或几百个字的范围内，运用自如，既能读讲，又能应用，是极为困难的。“速成识字法”则不同，它首先使学员大量地学会了“认”，并初步学会了“讲”，就为进一步地提高阅读和写作能力，开辟了宽广的道路。在初步会认、会讲的基础上，达到“四会”的目的，正可以加速“四会”的进度。把音、义、形等等学习文字的难点分散开来，各个击破，逐步占有。即：先行依靠注音、拼音和简单地讲解字义，重点使学员达到会读，并初步地会讲与熟悉字形；然后在教学语文课本和广泛地组织阅读、写作中更巩固地占有字音，更丰富地了解字义，并进一步地作到会写，逐渐提高应用的能力，达到“四会”的要求。祁建华同志说：“学生字，首先以认为主（不是不注意‘四会’，是先后问题），‘讲’、‘写’为次。好比一次给你介绍十几个人，你可能都记不住，但多见几次面就全熟悉了。许多字会认会讲以后，这些字在自己眼里已看多少遍，这时来写也就容易了。”
    祁建华同志十分重视工农群众、革命战士学习的自觉性，善于发挥成年人在学习上的优点。他深知战士迫切地要求学习文化的心理，并信赖他们克服困难的勇气与苦学苦练的战斗精神。他认为成年人生活丰富，语言也丰富，理解力强，联想力也强。
    一个个的字形，对于成年人中的文盲，虽然是生疏的，但在斗争中、生活中，他们却容易了解它所代表的意思，困难只在于他们不能把口说出来的字与写在纸上的字联系起来。大多数常用字，只要能读字音，就可以初步地了解字义。有了注音符号作辅助自学的“拐棍”，有了联系实际的教学方法和群众性的互助辅导工作，就可以便于记忆，克服“易忘”的弱点，因而学得多，学得快。所以祁建华同志在教学中，一面摸索着适合成人特点的速成方法，一面还特别注意在“为什么能够速成”与“怎样才能速成”这两个问题上，进行一系列的动员工作，树立学习信心，极大地发扬学员的积极性与自觉性。
    祁建华同志避免了那种单纯注入与脱离实际的教学方法，十分生动地发挥了我军群众路线的教学经验，紧紧地掌握联系实际的教学原则。这种精神贯彻了整个“速成识字法”的教学过程。祁建华同志极端重视学习的动员工作。他常说：“思想打通，情绪高涨！”“怎样教，就怎样学，听从学习指导，教者提出保证，学的自然也就振起精神，下定苦学的决心，教到那里学到那里，教员与学员的思想要完全取得一致。”他能够根据群众的水平，由易到难，由浅入深地教，如他先教“－、ㄨ、ㄩ”。他依据教学的实际情况和照顾各地方言，在教育中不苛求“标准音”，也不强调马上解决“四声”。他讲解字义注意联系战士最熟悉的语汇、事物，要求简单、具体（如给战士讲“径”字，讲“大炮口径”就比讲“途径的径”好记）。他的讲解更力求生动活泼与形象化，能够帮助记忆。在整个教学过程中，能不断地进行动员鼓励，表扬模范，发扬学习上的革命英雄主义，订个人学习计划，组织互助，深入班排，个别辅导，开展阅读、写字、写话运动，用口头广播、墙报、唱歌、识字游戏等辅助教学。
    祁建华同志所创造的“速成识字法”，在许多方面还待发展与提高，特别对大量突击认识单字以后的语文教学阶段，我们的经验还很少。但多次实践证明：运用“速成识字法”加速消除文盲的效果，是没有疑问的。    （新华社）
