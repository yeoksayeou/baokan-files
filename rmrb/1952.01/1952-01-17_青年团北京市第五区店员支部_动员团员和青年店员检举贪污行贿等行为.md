The Youth League Beijing Fifth District Shop Assistant Branch, in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, closely cooperated with the shop assistant's trade union to mobilize League members and the broad masses of young shop assistants to boldly report incidents of corruption, bribery, and tax evasion. As of January 10th, the district's shop assistants had submitted over eighty pieces of reporting material, of which more than two-thirds were reported by League members and young shop assistants.

After the start of this movement, the Youth League branch cadres listened to the mobilization reports of higher-level responsible cadres and clearly recognized that shop assistants are a part of the working class. They are distributed in every corner and have connections with all industries and all strata. They are also familiar with the inside information of the shops. Fully mobilizing them can make them an important force in reporting illegal acts such as corruption, bribery, and tax evasion. The youth among the shop assistants are a relatively active and positive part. Therefore, mobilizing young shop assistants to participate in the struggle through the League organization is an extremely important task for the shop assistant's League branch in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The Youth League Beijing Fifth District Shop Assistant Branch actively undertook this task.

The League branch first mobilized within the League, criticized the indifferent attitude of League members towards the movement, and emphasized that shop assistant League members should recognize that today's Chinese national bourgeoisie has its positive and progressive side, but also its dark and decadent side of seeking profits at the expense of others, harming others to benefit oneself, and speculation. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly draw a line ideologically, firmly stand on the position of the working class, and actively participate in the struggle. The League branch also specifically stipulated three tasks for League members: (1) Examine your own thoughts, recognize the significance of the movement, and stand firm on the class stand; (2) Report illegal acts such as bribery and tax evasion; (3) Carry out propaganda to the surrounding masses and unite the broad masses of young shop assistants to participate in the movement together. The League branch also specifically assigned each League member to do social work in a specific way according to the different situations of the League members. League branch cadres also had specific divisions of labor. The League group leaders guided the specific activities of League members and paid attention to solving the demands of the surrounding young masses. In this way, the League members were organized to move.

However, the Fifth District Shop Assistant Branch only has twenty-one League members, and they are distributed in fifteen units. To mobilize the broad masses of young shop assistants, it is necessary to first do a good job in the work of young activists. The League branch cooperated with the shop assistant's trade union to hold a forum for young shop assistants, explaining the great significance of this movement to them and calling on them to stand at the forefront of the struggle with the attitude of masters of the country. The League branch also organized League members to conduct propaganda and education work to young shop assistants who had concerns. At that time, the most common concerns of young shop assistants were fear of unemployment, fear of letting down friends, fear of not being able to get dividends, etc. For example, after some shop owners evaded taxes, they also distributed some extra "dividends" to the shop assistants in order to win them over. Some shop assistants were afraid of not getting these benefits and refused to report. League members pointed out to them that this was stolen property obtained by illegal merchants stealing national income; as a member of the working class, it is shameful to take advantage of this. In order to prevent the loss of national construction funds, they should resolutely report it. After breaking these concerns, many young shop assistants bravely reported. Young shop assistant Zhang Ruibin reported the matter of his shopkeeper colluding with cadres to steal and sell gasoline. The League branch immediately convened a branch meeting, widely absorbing activists to participate. Zhang Ruibin reported the struggle process, which encouraged the courage of the shop assistants present.

The League branch is very concerned about the struggle between League members and young shop assistants and illegal merchants, and is always ready to help and support them. For example, a young shop assistant in an electrical appliance store wanted to report his shopkeeper's tax evasion. The shopkeeper tried to lure him by offering to find him a wife. He hesitated. After learning about this, League branch secretary Bai Zhenxing went to talk to him, exposed the shopkeeper's conspiracy, and said to him: "This is the time to test us. We must stand firm, boldly report, the Communist Party, the People's Government, the trade union, the Youth League, and the broad masses of the people all support you!" Finally, he overcame his ideological obstacles and exposed his shopkeeper's tax evasion.

Now, there are more than 150 young shop assistants united around the Fifth District Shop Assistant League Branch. The League branch is continuing to closely cooperate with the shop assistant's trade union, relying on these activists to fully mobilize the district's more than 1,700 shop assistant masses and devote themselves to the reporting struggle.

    青年团北京市第五区店员支部
    动员团员和青年店员检举贪污行贿等行为
    青年团北京市第五区店员支部在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，密切配合店员工会，发动团员和广大青年店员大胆检举贪污、行贿和漏税事件。到一月十日为止，全区店员检举材料已经有八十多件，其中团员和青年店员检举的占三分之二以上。
    在这一运动开始以后，团支部干部听了上级负责干部的动员报告，明确地认识了店员是工人阶级的一部分，他们分布在各个角落，和各行业、各阶层都有联系，又熟知商店内情，把他们充分发动起来，就能成为检举贪污、行贿、漏税等非法行为的一支重要力量。店员中的青年又是比较活跃、积极的一部分。因此，通过团的组织去发动青年店员参加斗争，是店员团支部在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中的一项极重要的工作。青年团北京市第五区店员支部就积极地担负起了这项工作。
    团支部首先在团内进行动员，批判了团员中对运动漠不关心的态度，强调指出：店员团员应当认清今天中国的民族资产阶级有它积极进步的一面，但也有它唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧等黑暗腐朽的一面，因此必须从思想上明确地划清界限，坚定地站在工人阶级立场上，积极地参加斗争。团支部并具体规定了团员的三项任务：（一）检查自己思想，认清运动意义，站稳阶级立场；（二）检举行贿、偷税等不法行为；（三）向周围群众进行宣传，团结广大青年店员共同参加运动。团支部并按团员不同情况，采取自报公议的方式，具体地分配每个团员做社会工作。团支部干部也有具体分工。团小组长则指导团员的具体活动，注意解决周围青年群众的要求。这样，团员们就有组织地动起来了。
    但五区店员支部只有二十一个团员，而且分布在十五个单位中，要发动广大青年店员，还必须先做好青年积极分子的工作。团支部就协同店员工会召开了一次青年店员座谈会，向他们说明这次运动的伟大意义，号召他们以国家主人翁的态度站在斗争的前列。团支部又组织团员去向有顾虑的青年店员进行宣传教育工作。当时一般青年店员最普遍的顾虑是怕失业，怕对不起朋友，怕分不到红利等等。如某些商店的老板在偷税漏税以后，为了笼络店员，也分给他们一些额外的“红利”，有的店员怕得不到这点好处，不肯检举。团员们就向他们指出：这是不法商人偷盗国家收入得来的赃物；作为工人阶级一分子，要在这上面占便宜是可耻的，为了使国家建设资金不受损失，应该坚决检举。打破了这些顾虑以后，许多青年店员就勇敢进行检举。青年店员张瑞斌检举了自己掌柜勾结干部盗卖汽油的事，团支部立即召开支部大会，广泛吸收积极分子参加，由张瑞斌报告斗争经过，鼓舞了到会店员的勇气。
    团支部对于团员和青年店员与不法商人的斗争十分关心，随时去帮助和支持他们。如某电料行有个青年店员想检举自己掌柜的漏税行为。掌柜用给他说媳妇的办法来引诱他。他犹豫起来，团支部书记白振兴知道后就去找他谈话，揭穿了掌柜的阴谋，对他说：“这正是考验我们的时候，要站稳立场，大胆检举，共产党、人民政府、工会、青年团和广大人民都是支持你的！”最后终于使他克服了思想障碍，揭发了他掌柜的漏税行为。
    现在，团结在第五区店员团支部周围的青年店员已有一百五十多人。团支部正继续密切地配合店员工会，依靠这些积极分子，把全区一千七百多店员群众全面发动起来，投入检举斗争。（新华社）
