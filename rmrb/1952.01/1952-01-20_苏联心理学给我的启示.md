    In the realm of natural science, many natural scientists still harbor doubts about the relationship between Marxism-Leninism and natural science, as well as the superiority of Soviet natural science. Personally, I study psychology, and I won't delve into the relationship between Marxism-Leninism and psychology here; I'll only discuss the inspirations and encouragement I've received from Soviet psychology.
    I graduated from the Psychology Department of Tsinghua University. At that time, all the teaching content in the Psychology Department of Tsinghua University was American-style. So-called psychology was merely messing around with white mice in the laboratory and doing some "intelligence tests" in primary and secondary schools. Although I "diligently studied" and got very good grades in exams, I felt inwardly distressed: psychology couldn't solve any problems. Later, I "traveled far" and entered Cambridge University in England. In the psychology department there, I saw research on perceptual psychology related to radar signals commissioned by the British military (Navy, Army, Air Force), research on work efficiency under hot and cold conditions, and other wartime psychological studies; in theory, I listened to McDugall's "Theory of Emotion," Bartlett's elusive "Schema" theory, and Farmer's "Industrial Psychology" which suggested "workers can only do mechanical work." In this "classical" university, I earned a Ph.D. in psychology, but I didn't find the path of psychology!
    I didn't find the path of psychology until I went to the Soviet Union this summer!
    There are three large-scale psychology research institutes in the Soviet Union, as well as many psychology research departments attached to relevant research institutions. The psychological community is studying, in addition to language and thought, the neural and physiological processes of the psyche, the psychological development of children, and other major theoretical and applied problems, two central problems that have given me even greater inspiration and encouragement. One is the study of individual abilities. The goal of this research is to maximize the development of individual abilities in education and to maximize the utilization of individual abilities in work. This is in line with the principle of "from each according to his ability" in socialist construction. Another central problem is the study of the labor process. Here, labor does not only refer to mechanical muscle work, but to all physical and mental activities. The research is not on mechanical muscle work, but on the combination and consistency of physical and mental labor – how to strengthen the intellectual component in physical labor and improve its ideologically; how to make physical labor strengthen intellectual labor and enrich its content; and how to improve the efficiency of physical and mental labor, and ultimately eliminate the distinction between physical and mental labor. As everyone knows, eliminating the distinction between physical and mental labor is one of the important conditions for the realization of communism. In a communist society, the distinction between physical and mental labor will inevitably disappear. From this, we can see how Soviet psychology practically serves socialist construction and the realization of communism.
    The Soviet psychological community has pointed out a bright path for the global psychological community. Under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, Soviet psychology workers are working enthusiastically, full of confidence in victory, and are our role models!

    苏联心理学给我的启示
    中国科学院心理学研究所所长　曹日昌
    今天还有不少的自然科学工作者对于马克思列宁主义和自然科学的关系与苏联的自然科学的优越性，在思想上存着不少的疑问。我个人是学心理学的，关于马克思列宁主义与心理学的关系，这里不谈；只谈一点苏联的心理学给我的启示与鼓励。
    我是清华大学心理学系毕业的。那时清华大学心理学系内一切教学的内容都是美国式的。所谓心理学也就是在实验室里弄弄白鼠，走到中小学做点
    “智力测验”而已。那时虽然也“孜孜为学”，弄得考试的分数很不错，但内心是苦闷的：心理学解决不了什么问题。后来又“负笈长征”，进了英国的剑桥大学。在那里的心理学系，看到了受英国军部（海、陆、空）委托的关于雷达信号的知觉、关于在炎热与冰寒情况下的工作效率等等备战心理学的研究；在理论方面听了麦可狄的“情绪决定论”，巴特莱的不可捉摸的“图式”学说，以及法莫耳的“工人只可做机械工作”的“工业心理学”。在这个“古典”的大学内，得了心理学的哲学博士学位，但没有找到心理学的路子！
    心理学的路子，直到今年夏天我到了苏联，才找到了！
    全苏联有三个规模宏大的心理学研究所，还有许多有关的研究机关中附设的心理学研究部门。心理学界所研究的，除了语文与思想，心理的神经、生理历程，儿童心理发展等在理论与应用上都是重大的问题以外，两个中心问题给我的启示与鼓舞更大。一个是个人能力的研究。这方面研究的目标是使个人在教育上尽量发展其能力，在工作中尽量发挥其能力。这是和社会主义建设中实现“各尽所能”的原则相适应的。另一个中心问题是劳动过程的研究。这里所谓劳动不是仅指机械的肌肉工作，而是指全部身心活动的劳动。所研究的不是机械的肌肉工作，而是体力劳动与智力劳动的结合与其一致性——如何加强体力劳动中的智力活动的成分，提高其思想性；如何使体力劳动加强智力劳动，丰富其内容；提高体力劳动与智力劳动的效率，最后消灭体力劳动与智力劳动的区别。大家知道，消除体力劳动与智力劳动的区别是实现共产主义的重要条件之一，在共产主义社会中体力劳动与智力劳动的区别也必然消灭。由这里可以看出来，苏联的心理学如何切实地服务于社会主义的建设与共产主义的实现。
    苏联的心理学界给全世界的心理学界指出了一条光明的大路。苏联的心理学工作者，在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，热情地工作着，充满了胜利的信心，是我们的榜样！
