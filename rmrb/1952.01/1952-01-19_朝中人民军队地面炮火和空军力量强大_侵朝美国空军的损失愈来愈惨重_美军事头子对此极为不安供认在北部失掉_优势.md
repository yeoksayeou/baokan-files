Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch: Under the blows of the ground artillery and the People's Air Force of the Korean and Chinese People's Army, the losses of the invading American Air Force in Korea are becoming increasingly heavy.

According to a United Press dispatch from the headquarters of the Fifth Air Force on the 12th, "Since the ground war has turned to be eased and the Allied offensive actions have been taken over by the air force, weekly losses have been gradually increasing."

The Korean and Chinese People's Army shot down or damaged a total of 275 enemy aircraft in November of last year, an average of 68.7 per week. In December, 309 enemy aircraft were shot down or damaged, and the weekly average number increased sharply to 77.2. Since January of this year, the situation of American aircraft losses has become even more serious. According to the same United Press report: In the week from January 6 to January 12, "the Allies suffered the greatest losses in air force aspect in the Korean War." Although the cable used greatly reduced figures in an attempt to conceal the defeat, it still had to admit: "Allied losses far exceeded the recent weekly average of aircraft losses."

The increasing losses of the American Air Force have made American generals extremely uneasy. Finley, the United States Secretary of the Air Force, and Vandenberg, the Air Force Chief of Staff, have recently expressed serious concern about this. Even Van Fleet, the commander of the Eighth Army of the invading US forces in Korea, who has always shamelessly boasted of the "military strength" of the US, admitted on the 13th: "In the area near the Yalu River, our air force does not have the kind of advantage it used to have."

    朝中人民军队地面炮火和空军力量强大
    侵朝美国空军的损失愈来愈惨重
    美军事头子对此极为不安供认在北部失掉“优势”
    【新华社十八日讯】在朝中人民军队地面炮火和人民空军的打击下，侵朝美国空军的损失愈来愈惨重。
    据美联社第五航空队司令部十二日电透露：“自从地面战争转趋缓和以及联军攻势行动转由空军进行以来，每周损失一直逐渐在增加着。”
    朝中人民军队在去年十一月份共击落击伤敌机二百七十五架，平均每周为六十八·七架。十二月份，击落击伤敌机三百零九架，每周平均数字即激增到七十七·二架。今年一月份以来，美机损失的情况就更加严重。据美联社同一消息承认：在一月六日到十二日的一周中，“联军遭受到朝鲜战争中空军方面的最大损失”。该电虽用大大缩小了的数字以图掩饰败绩，但仍不得不承认：“联军损失远远超过近来每周飞机平均损失的数目。”
    美国空军愈来愈大的损失，已使美国的将军们极为不安。美国空军部长芬立脱、空军参谋长范顿伯最近都对此表示严重忧虑。甚至一向厚颜无耻地吹嘘美方“军事力量”的侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特也在十三日承认：“在鸭绿江附近地区，我们的空军并没有它以前所有的那种优势了。”
