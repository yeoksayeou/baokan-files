    Vigorously and Resolutely Oppose Corruption and Waste
    Xi'an Holds a Rally of 70,000 People to Pronounce Sentences on Corrupt Criminals
    On January 4th, the Xi'an Municipal People's Government held a rally to pronounce sentences on corrupt criminals. Participating in the rally were all staff members of Party, government, and military units and affiliated enterprises at the Northwest Region, Shaanxi Province, and Xi'an Municipality levels, all staff members of people's organizations, representatives of major universities and middle schools, the industrial and commercial circles of Xi'an, staff members of the Xi'an municipal district governments, and representatives of people from all walks of life, totaling more than 70,000 people. This was the first large-scale rally to pronounce sentences on corrupt criminals in the movement to vigorously oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, on the same scale as suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The Xi'an Municipal People's Court announced the crimes of fourteen corrupt criminals (three of whom were sentenced in Lanzhou).
    The rally began at 10:30 AM. When the eleven corrupt criminals were escorted to the scene, the crowd angrily shouted anti-corruption slogans that lasted for a long time.
    Mayor Fang Zhongru, Northwest Judicial Department Minister Yang Zilian, Northwest People's Supervisory Committee Deputy Director Shi Zijing, Shaanxi Provincial People's Government Vice Chairman Han Zhao'e, Xi'an Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee Vice Chairman Kang Xinzai, and Supreme People's Court Northwest Branch President Ma Xiwu spoke successively at the rally. They unanimously called on all cadres and the masses of the city to immediately and urgently take action to expose and denounce all corrupt and wasteful elements, expose the bad work style of bureaucracy, and resolutely eliminate obstacles to the production increase and frugality movement. They also called on corrupt elements to immediately repent, confess voluntarily, and start anew. If they refuse to repent, persist in betraying the people's stand, and attempt to conceal their crimes, their fate will inevitably be the same as the corrupt elements sentenced this time.
    During the rally, more than 30 letters were received from people from all walks of life, organizations, groups, schools, and individuals inside and outside the venue who listened to the live broadcast. These letters were written by workers, government staff, school teachers and students, people, youth representatives, propagandists, and radio listeners. The letters unanimously expressed support for the people's government punishing corrupt elements; expressed their willingness to help the government expose corruption, waste, and bureaucratic elements, and respond to the ideological remolding movement.
    At 12:00 PM, the President of the Xi'an Municipal People's Court, Ren Fuzhong, amid enthusiastic applause from the audience, announced the crimes and sentences of this group of corrupt elements. Zhang Huaiwu, who was sentenced to death, was immediately escorted to the execution ground and executed by shooting.
    The criminal facts of the fourteen corrupt criminals are as follows: Zhang Huaiwu, Wang Dewu, Zhao Shiwu, Dong Zhengping, Wei Zheng, Fan Xinghua, Zhang Yonghe and other seven criminals collectively stole a large quantity of military supplies. Zhang Huaiwu, formerly the captain of a motorcade in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, deserted his post in June 1950. Later, he impersonated an escort officer and, in July 1950, took the opportunity to collude with unscrupulous merchants to steal three tons of military homespun cloth (a total of one hundred and twenty rolls, each roll thirty bolts) from the logistics department of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, embezzling huge amounts of state funds, and then absconded with the money to sell drugs and gold and silver, disrupting finance, and his crime was extremely heinous. After he was arrested, he remained stubborn and refused to confess his mistakes. Wang Dewu was the freight director of the Xi'an office of the Lanzhou Hongyuan Trade and Transportation Company. Instead of delivering state goods to the receiving agency, he colluded with Zhang Huaiwu and other illegal merchants such as Zhao Shiwu to steal military supplies. Zhao Shiwu, manager of Lixing Trading Company, accountant Dong Zhengping, and machine affairs director Wei Zheng hid military supplies; after they conspired with Zhang Huaiwu, Wang Dewu and others to steal military supplies, Zhao Shiwu instructed Zhang Yimin to sell them at a low price. Zhang Yonghe and Zhang Huaiwu jointly sold drugs. Fan Xinghua was the manager of the Xi'an office of Hongyuan Trade and Transportation Company. He was responsible for transporting military supplies and shielded Zhang Huaiwu, falsely claiming that Zhang Huaiwu was an escort officer, allowing Zhang Huaiwu to escort military supplies; later, he knew that Zhang Huaiwu was hiding military supplies and colluding with Wang Dewu and others to steal and sell them, but he did not report it to the First Field Army Logistics Department. This group of criminals, except for Zhang Yimin who absconded, were all arrested in 1951. After interrogation and judgment by the Xi'an Municipal People's Court, the judgment was submitted to the Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee for approval. The sentences were: Zhang Huaiwu, death penalty, to be executed immediately; Wang Dewu, life imprisonment; Zhao Shiwu and Dong Zhengping, nine years imprisonment each; Wei Zheng, eight years imprisonment; Fan Xinghua, five years imprisonment; Zhang Yonghe, three years imprisonment; Zhang Yimin, wanted for arrest and dealt with according to law.
    Wang Baoxuan, a probationary employee of the West Avenue office of the Xi'an Branch of the People's Bank of China, Dou Jicong, an accountant of the Xi'an Branch Cooperative, Lü Chengqun, a trainee of the North Guan office of the Xi'an Branch, Li Hanmin, a probationary employee of the Xi'an Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, Wang Shijie, an affairs clerk of the Northwest Opera Research Institute, Wang Xinkang, a section member of the Northwest Petroleum Administration Bureau, and Yang Guangshi, the manager of the Heyang branch of Xinhua Bookstore, were all sentenced to varying terms of labor reform and imprisonment of one, three, and ten years for embezzlement or misappropriation of public funds.

    大张旗鼓雷厉风行反对贪污浪费
    西安七万人集会宣判贪污罪犯
    一月四日，西安市人民政府举行了宣判贪污罪犯大会。参加这个大会的有西北区、陕西省、西安市三级党政军各单位和附属企业单位的全体工作人员，人民团体全体工作人员，各大、中学校代表，西安市工商界，西安市各区政府工作人员，各界人民代表等共七万多人。这是在大张旗鼓地反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动中，像镇压反革命一样的大规模地宣判贪污罪犯的第一个大会。由西安市人民法院宣判了十四名贪污罪犯（有三名是在兰州受判处）的罪行。
    大会在上午十时半开始。当十一名贪污罪犯被押解到场时，全场群众愤怒地高呼反对贪污的口号，经久不息。
    大会由方仲如市长、西北司法部杨子廉部长、西北人民监察委员会师子敬副主任、陕西省人民政府韩兆鹗副主席、西安市各界人民代表会议协商委员会亢心栽副主席、最高人民法院西北分院马锡五院长相继讲话。他们一致号召全体干部和全市人民群众，立即紧张地行动起来，检举和揭发一切贪污浪费分子，揭发官僚主义的恶劣作风，坚决扫除增产节约运动的障碍；他们并号召贪污分子立即悔悟，自动坦白，重新做人。如果拒不改悔，坚持背叛人民的立场，企图隐瞒，他们的下场必然会和这次宣判的贪污分子一样。
    大会进行中，收到了会场内及在会场外收听实况广播的各界人民群众、机关、团体、学校、个人等写给大会的信三十多件，这些信是工人、机关工作人员、学校师生、人民群众、青年代表、宣传员、广播收音站听众写来的。这些信件一致表示拥护人民政府惩办贪污分子；表示要帮助政府检举贪污浪费和官僚主义分子，响应思想改造运动。
    十二时，西安市人民法院任扶中院长在全场热烈鼓掌声中宣读了这批贪污分子的罪行和判刑。判处死刑的张怀武立即被押赴刑场执行枪决。
    十四名贪污犯犯罪事实如下：张怀武、王德武、赵世五、董正平、魏征、范兴华、张永合等七犯集体大量盗窃军用物资。张怀武，原是人民解放军某部汽车队长，在一九五○年六月弃职逃跑。后又冒充押车员，在一九五○年七月，乘机勾结奸商，盗取人民解放军第一野战军后勤部军用土布三吨（共一百二十卷，每卷三十匹），侵吞国家巨款，又带款潜逃，贩卖毒品和黄金白银，扰乱金融，罪大恶极。他被逮捕后始终顽抗，不肯坦白认错。王德武是兰州宏远贸易运输公司西安办事处运货主任，他不把国家货物交送接受机关，反而勾结张怀武，伙同赵世五等不法奸商，盗取军用物资。力行商行经理赵世五、会计董正平、机务主任魏征等三犯窝藏军用物资；他们与张怀武、王德武等合谋盗取军用物资后，赵世五又指使张毅民低价盗卖，张永合和张怀武共同贩卖毒品。范兴华是宏远贸易运输公司西安办事处经理，承运军用物资，包庇张怀武，诈称张怀武是押车员，使张怀武得以押运军用物资；以后他明知张怀武隐藏军用物资，并和王德武等伙同盗卖，但不报告一野后勤部。这批罪犯，除张毅民潜逃外，其余都在一九五一年内先后就捕，经西安市人民法院审讯判决，并呈报西北军政委员会主席批准。判处：张怀武死刑，立即执行；王德武无期徒刑；赵世五、董正平各徒刑九年；魏征徒刑八年；范兴华徒刑五年；张永合徒刑三年；张毅民通缉归案法办。
