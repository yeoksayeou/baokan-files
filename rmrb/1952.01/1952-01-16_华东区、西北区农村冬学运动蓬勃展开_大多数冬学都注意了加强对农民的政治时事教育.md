    The winter study movement in rural areas of East China has flourished, with over ten million farmers participating. Most of the winter schools in rural East China started in December of last year. This year, farmers are attending winter school with unprecedented enthusiasm. The original plan for the entire region was to mobilize 13 to 15 million farmers to attend winter school; currently, in Shandong and Fujian provinces, and northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu regions alone, the number of farmers attending winter school exceeds ten million. Among them, over two million farmers in northern Jiangsu are attending winter school, tripling the number of students from last year. Enrollment in other regions has also more than doubled compared to last year. In the third village of Liubao Township, Danyang County, southern Jiangsu, where land reform was completed last spring, sixty-two out of one hundred and thirty-five households, excluding children and the elderly, have all enrolled in winter school. Many enrolled farmers use income from their sideline production to solve the funding problem for winter schools. The winter study movement has greatly helped the development of rural work. For example, after farmers in Lian Si Village on the outskirts of Jinan City, Shandong Province, learned the principles of increasing production and practicing economy, every household in the village formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy.

    The vigorous development of the winter study movement in rural East China is inseparable from the serious preparation work done by governments at all levels in East China. As early as mid-September of last year, the Education Department of the East China Military and Political Committee convened a meeting to discuss the guidelines, tasks, teachers, and teaching materials for carrying out rural winter studies. In early October of last year, the East China Military and Political Committee issued "Instructions on the Work of Winter Studies in 1951"; at the same time, the Education Department of the East China Military and Political Committee issued an "Implementation Plan for Winter Studies in the East China Region in 1951". After receiving the above instructions and plans, local governments convened meetings one after another to formulate plans for carrying out rural winter studies in each province and region. In November of last year, various places trained winter school teachers on a large scale in a planned and step-by-step manner. Those participating in the training were local original private school teachers and rural intellectuals who had been selected. For example, in Shandong Province, forty-three counties in only four special districts including Tai'an, Yishui, Laiyang, and Linyi trained more than 33,000 winter school teachers; in Fujian Province, in October of last year, there were more than 40,000 rural intellectuals working as winter school teachers, and more than 10,000 of them were specially trained as the backbone of winter school teachers. Local cultural and educational departments also compiled and printed unified winter school teaching materials.

    In leading winter studies, governments at all levels in East China have paid special attention to strengthening political and current affairs education for farmers, instilling patriotism in farmers, and making ideological preparations for the large-scale production movement this year. In order to improve the quality of political teachers in winter schools and strengthen political and current affairs education in winter schools, northern Jiangsu established a "Winter School Political and Current Affairs Transmission System" throughout the region, with the county establishing a "Transmission Headquarters" and the district establishing a "Transmission Branch". The heads and deputy heads of each headquarters were respectively the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee and the Director of the County People's Government's Culture and Education Section, with a number of transmitters under them. The Transmission Headquarters periodically determined the teaching content and transmitted political current events to winter school teachers through transmitters and branches. In addition, many regions have established winter school committees or winter school working groups, which regularly inspect the progress of winter schools in various places.

    The winter study movement has been widely launched in the vast rural and pastoral areas of Northwest China. According to preliminary statistics, the number of male and female farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups attending winter school accounts for more than 12% of the total population of the agricultural and pastoral areas in Northwest China, totaling more than 3.54 million people, an increase of more than one and a half times compared with the number of winter school students in 1950.

    This year, most winter schools in Northwest China have paid attention to strengthening political and current affairs education in conjunction with various central tasks. Winter schools in land reform areas such as Jiuquan Special District in Gansu Province, Jinji County in Ningxia Province, and Xunyang County in Shaanxi Province have actively publicized land reform policies and related laws and regulations, and launched a "cultural bitterness" movement among winter school students to further expose the crimes of the landlord class in oppressing farmers. After many liberated farmers entered winter school, they revised their patriotic pacts; some also formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy. After hearing the principles of "increasing production and practicing economy," winter school students in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County in Gansu Province spontaneously formed more than a dozen forest protection groups to protect forests. Reading groups have also greatly developed in winter schools in various places. Ninety-nine winter schools in Pingluo County, Ningxia Province alone have newly established one hundred and fifty-four reading groups.

    This year, farmers and herdsmen in Northwest China are very enthusiastic about learning, and the number of people attending winter school generally exceeds the original quota. The Aksu Special District in Xinjiang Province originally planned to recruit 45,000 winter school students, but it has now exceeded twice that number. In individual regions, such as Xinjian Township in Xunyang County, Shaanxi Province, all men and women, young and old, except for children under seven years old and the deaf or blind elderly, participated in winter school learning. The masses in various places have also spontaneously come up with many ways to overcome learning difficulties, such as making chalk from white soil, inkstones from red soil, and pencils from willow branches. In some places, the masses used temples as winter school classrooms. Some villages have also set up temporary nurseries to solve the problem of women entering school.

    In order to implement the principle of "educating the people by the people," local cultural and educational departments have promoted a large number of mass teachers and conducted centralized training for them for one week to ten days before the start of winter school. According to statistics from Shaanxi Province, mass teachers in each county generally account for more than 50% of the total number of winter school teachers, with the highest reaching 80%; many of them are excellent students who transferred from past winter schools to farmers' spare-time schools. All localities have established guidance organizations centered on complete primary schools, private schools, etc., to strengthen the leadership of mass teachers and gradually improve their teaching quality, laying the foundation for winter schools in various places to transition to regular private schools this year.

    华东区、西北区农村冬学运动蓬勃展开
    大多数冬学都注意了加强对农民的政治时事教育
    华东地区的农民已有一千多万人参加了冬学学习。华东各地农村的冬学，大部分在去年十二月内开学。今年农民上冬学的情况空前热烈。全区原计划动员一千三百万到一千五百万农民入冬学；现仅山东、福建两省和皖北、苏北两区上冬学的农民就超过了一千万人。其中苏北地区入冬学的农民有二百多万，超过去年入学人数的三倍。其他地区入学人数也超过去年一倍以上。去春完成土地改革的苏南丹阳县留堡乡第三村一百三十五户农民中，就有六十二户农民除小孩和老年人外全都上了冬学。许多入学农民用自己副业生产的收入，解决冬学的经费问题。冬学运动对农村工作的开展有很大帮助。如山东省济南市郊连四村的农民，上冬学知道了增产节约的道理以后，全村家家户户都订出增产节约的计划。
    华东农村冬学运动的蓬勃开展，是和华东各级人民政府认真作好冬学的准备工作分不开的。华东军政委员会教育部早在去年九月中旬就召开会议，商讨开展农村冬学的方针、任务、师资和教材等问题。去年十月初，华东军政委员会发布“关于一九五一年冬学工作的指示”；同时，华东军政委员会教育部发出了“关于华东区一九五一年冬学实施计划”。各地人民政府接到上述指示和计划后，先后召开会议，制订了各省、区开展农村冬学的计划。去年十一月，各地都有计划、有步骤地、大规模地训练了冬学教师。参加受训的都是经过选择的当地原有的民校教师和乡村知识分子。例如山东省仅泰安、沂水、莱阳、临沂等四个专区的四十三个县，就训练了三万三千多名冬学教师；福建省在去年十月间就有四万多农村知识分子作冬学教师，并专门训练了其中的一万多人作为冬学教师中的骨干分子。各地文教部门并编印了统一的冬学教材。
    华东各地人民政府在领导冬学中，特别注意加强对农民的政治时事教育，向农民灌输爱国主义思想，为开展今年的大生产运动作好思想准备工作。苏北区为了提高冬学政治教师的质量，加强冬学中的政治时事教育，全区各地都建立了“冬学政治时事传授制度”，县设立“传授总站”，区设“传授分站”。各总站由中共县委宣传部长和县人民政府文教科长分任正、副站长，下设若干传授员。传授总站按期确定教学内容，通过传授员和分站向冬学教师传授政治时事。此外，许多地区成立了冬学委员会或冬学工作组，定期到各地巡回检查冬学的进行情况。　　　　　（新华社）
    西北广大农村和游牧区的冬学运动已普遍展开。据初步统计，各民族男、女农民和牧民上冬学的人数占西北农牧地区人口总数的百分之十二以上，共达三百五十四万多人，比一九五○年冬学人数增加了一倍半以上。
    今年西北区各地冬学大多数都注意了结合各项中心工作，加强了政治时事教育。甘肃省酒泉专区、宁夏省金积县和陕西省洵阳县等实行土地改革地区的冬学，都积极宣传土地改革政策和各项有关法令，并发动冬学学员开展了“文化诉苦”运动，以进一步揭露地主阶级压迫农民的罪恶。许多翻身农民进冬学后纷纷修订了爱国公约；有的还订出了增产节约计划。甘肃省天祝藏族自治区的冬学学员听了“增产节约”的道理后，便自动成立了十多个护林小组保护森林。在各地冬学中，读报组也有了很大发展，仅宁夏省平罗县九十九个冬学就新成立了读报组一百五十四个。
    今年西北区的农、牧民要求学习的情绪非常热烈，上冬学的人数一般都超过了原订名额。新疆省阿克苏专区原计划吸收冬学学员四万五千名，现已超过了一倍。个别地区如陕西省洵阳县新建乡除了七岁以下幼童和耳聋或眼睛失明的老人以外，全乡男女老少都参加了冬学学习。各地群众并自动想出了很多办法来克服学习上的困难。如把白土制成粉笔，红土制成墨砚，柳木条烧成铅笔等。有些地方的群众利用庙宇作冬学教室。有些村并设立了临时托儿所，解决了妇女入学的困难。
    为贯彻“以民教民”的方针，各地文教部门曾大批提拔群众教师，并在冬学开始前对他们进行了一周至十天的集中训练。据陕西省的统计，各县群众教师一般占冬学教师总数的百分之五十以上，最高的达到了百分之八十；其中很多是过去冬学转入农民业余学校的优秀学员。各地都设有以完全小学、民校等为中心的辅导组织，以加强对群众教师的领导和逐步提高他们的教学质量，为今年各地冬学转入常年民校打下基础。　　　（新华社）
