    At the Mobilization Meeting Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy
    Minister of Justice Shi Liang Makes Self-Criticism
    The Chinese Communist Party Branch of the Ministry of Justice of the Central People's Government, in order to better carry out the mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, held a meeting of Party members at the section chief level and above on New Year's Day for self-criticism. Minister Shi Liang attended this meeting. At this meeting, Deputy Minister Li Mu'an examined how, in his private life regarding food, clothing, housing, and transportation, he had unknowingly developed a dangerous tendency towards enjoyment and forgetting his origins. In handling family affairs, he focused on personal warmth and emotions, retaining feudal remnants. In his work, he exhibited a bureaucratic attitude of relying on his seniority and getting by. Wang Huaian, Director of the General Office, also confessed to the growth of certain hedonistic ideas in his private life. In his work, because he opposed judicial business to institutional administration, he neglected the care of state property, resulting in a serious bureaucratic attitude towards institutional financial expenditures.
    On January 2nd, the Ministry of Justice of the Central Government held a mobilization meeting for all staff members. Minister Shi Liang first delivered a mobilization report. Minister Shi pointed out that everyone should respond to Chairman Mao's call and launch a mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in a vigorous and decisive manner. In the movement, democracy must be fully developed, and each should conduct self-examinations and mutual examinations from top to bottom and from bottom to top. She pointed out that carrying out this movement can promote increased production and savings economically, maintain and promote the fine tradition of hard work and plain living of revolutionary cadres politically, and prevent corruption by the bourgeois way of life; historically, it can eliminate the corrupt practices of thousands of years, especially during the Kuomintang rule, and change the social atmosphere. She then criticized the concerns currently existing in the minds of cadres, such as fear of losing face, fear of punishment, and taking chances (thinking they can get away with it). Finally, she encouraged everyone to make accusations and announced: "Those who speak are not guilty, those who accuse are not investigated, and those who suppress democracy must be dealt with." In her speech, she also emphasized self-criticism. She said: After participating in yesterday's meeting of Communist Party members for self-criticism, she was deeply moved and clearly realized the seriousness of her extravagant and wasteful habits. She also said that she originally came from a poor background, but after becoming a lawyer in the old society, her income was rich, and the income belonged to her, so her life gradually rose to the level of the petty bourgeoisie and even the bourgeoisie. After becoming the Minister of Justice of the Central People's Government, she still followed her past living habits and used her past living standards to handle her private life. For example, the equipment and arrangement of her residence were more elaborate; and for the comfort of life, she spent more than 700,000 yuan to transport an electric refrigerator from Shanghai. This excessive expenditure was unnecessary and superfluous, and therefore wasteful. Similarly, in dealing with some problems in the Ministry of Justice, she often proceeded from the point of view of saving face and doing favors, rather than from the point of view of changing customs and habits. For example, in order to decorate the Ministry of Justice, she paid for some flowers and plants herself. When cadres raised opinions that it was not appropriate to waste money, she felt that she paid for the flowers and plants herself and that it was for the good of the public, so she did not realize that this was waste. Also, every year during festivals, she advocated giving gifts to cadres in the ministry; although some cadres raised objections, she still disagreed in her mind. She analyzed that the main ideas that caused this extravagance and waste were, first, being satisfied with her inherent petty-bourgeois and bourgeois way of life, and defending it with the reason that "I am one of the four classes protected by the Common Program, so my way of life is legal." Second, emphasizing the ownership of personal property, thereby opposing her own property to social property, without knowing that since she is one of the masters of society, her property is also a part of social property, and wasting her own property is also wasting social property. The result is wasting her own money and also contributing to the waste in the ministry. It is precisely because of these wrong ideas that "brave and happy" extravagance and waste are formed. Therefore, she deeply felt that as a revolutionary cadre of the People's Government, especially as a minister of the Central People's Government, it was wrong to still inherit the habits of the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie in her way of life, and she should carefully examine herself and learn the style of hard work and plain living; and this examination and improvement must be achieved through everyone's help and constant supervision. Finally, she called on the national judicial organs to first carry out a mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy within the organs, and then raise the judicial weapon to serve the national mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and use state law to punish corrupt and wasteful elements. Therefore, the Ministry of Justice of the Central Government and the judicial organs at all levels throughout the country should take the promotion of this movement as the central task at present.
    Li Mu'an, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Justice, Wang Huaian, Director of the General Office, and Wang Yuechen, Director of the First Department, also made self-criticisms at the meeting. The atmosphere at the meeting was tense throughout. The frankness and accusation movement in the Ministry of Justice is currently underway.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义动员大会上
    中央司法部史良部长作自我检讨
    中央人民政府司法部中国共产党支部为了更好地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的群众运动，曾在元旦召开科长以上党员会议进行检讨；史良部长曾列席这次会议。在这次检讨会上，副部长李木庵同志检查他自己在私生活的衣食住行方面，不知不觉中，发生了意在享受、忘其所以的危险趋势。在处理家庭人事方面，着重于私人的温暖情感，保有封建余习；而在工作方面则有倚老卖老得过且过的官僚主义态度。办公厅主任王怀安同志也检讨出在私生活中滋长了某些享乐思想。在工作中，因为把司法业务和机关行政相对立，忽视对于国家财产的爱护，以致对于机关财政开支采取了严重的官僚主义态度。
    本月二日，中央司法部召开了全体工作人员的动员大会，首由史良部长作动员报告。史部长指出，大家要响应毛主席的号召，大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的群众运动。在运动中，必须充分发扬民主，进行从上到下和从下到上的各自检查与互相检查。她指出开展这一运动，在经济上可以促进增产节约，在政治上可以保持和发扬革命干部艰苦朴素的优良传统，不受资产阶级生活方式的腐蚀；在历史上则可肃清几千年来的、特别是国民党统治时期的贪污恶习，移转社会的风气。她接着对目前干部思想中所存在的顾虑，如怕丢面子、怕处罚和图侥幸（以为可以混过去）等，进行了批判。最后鼓励大家实行检举，并宣布：“言者无罪，告者不究，压制民主者必办。”她讲话中又着重做了自我批评。她说：参加了昨天中国共产党党员的检讨会后，深受感动，因而清楚地认识到自己的铺张浪费习气的严重性。她又说，她本来出身清苦，但自在旧社会做律师后，因收入丰富，而收入又是属于自己的，于是就使自己的生活逐渐地上升到小资产阶级甚至资产阶级的生活水平；及至做了中央人民政府的司法部部长后，仍一本过去的生活习惯，以过去的生活水平来处理私生活。例如住宅设备和布置较讲究；又如为了生活的安适，以七十多万元的运费把电气冰箱从上海运来。这种过高的开支是不必要的，是多余的，因而是铺张浪费。同样地，在处理司法部的一些问题上也往往从好面子、做人情的观点出发，而不从移风易俗的观点出发。例如为了装饰司法部，她自己掏钱买了一些花草。干部向她提出不宜浪费的意见，她觉得买花草是自己掏的钱，又是为公家好，就没认识这是浪费。又如每逢年节，她主张给部内干部送礼；虽经某些干部提出劝阻意见，她在思想上仍不同意。她分析造成这种铺张浪费的主要思想，一是满足于自己所固有的小资产阶级与资产阶级生活方式，并且以“自己是共同纲领所保护的四个阶级之一，因而自己的生活方式是合法的”这一理由为辩护。二是强调个人财产的所有权，因而把自己的财产和社会财产对立起来，而不知自己既是社会主人之一，自己的财产也是社会财产的一部分，浪费了自己的财产也就是浪费了社会的财产，其结果是浪费了自己的款项，也助长了部里的浪费现象。正因为有这些错误思想，也就形成“勇敢的、快乐的”铺张浪费。因而她深深地感到做为一个人民政府的革命干部，尤其作为中央人民政府的一个部长，在生活方式上仍因袭着过去小资产阶级和资产阶级的习惯，是错误的，应好好检查自己，并学习艰苦朴素作风；而这一检查和改进必须通过大家的帮助和经常的监督。最后，她号召全国司法机关首先进行机关内的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的群众运动，从而举起司法武器为全国的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的群众运动服务，并以国法制裁贪污浪费分子。因此，中央司法部和全国各级司法机关都应以推进这一运动为当前的中心工作。
    中央司法部副部长李木庵、办公厅主任王怀安和第一司司长王悦尘也相继在会上作了检讨。会上情绪始终很紧张。现司法部的坦白、检举运动正在开展中。
