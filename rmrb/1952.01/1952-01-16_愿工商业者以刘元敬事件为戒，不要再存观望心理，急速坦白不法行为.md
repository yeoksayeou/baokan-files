May industrialists and businessmen take the Liu Yuanjing incident as a warning, abandon their wait-and-see attitude, and rapidly confess illegal activities
北京市工商业联合会主任 Fu Huating

    The Beijing Municipal Committee for Economy and Thrift Inspection began a comprehensive inspection of the industrial and commercial sectors on January 12th. On that day, it uncovered a major case involving Jingye, Yuxing, and other construction companies who, in pursuit of exorbitant profits, colluded with cadres, engaged in bribery, cut corners, and collectively stole over 8 billion yuan of state assets in contracted national defense construction projects. The principal offenders, Liu Yuanjing, Li Shanzhang, and others, committed serious crimes and have been arrested and brought to justice by the government. The exposure of such a massive case at the beginning of the inspection has advanced the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in the industrial and commercial sectors and provided a more practical and profound education for the broad masses of industrialists and businessmen. For me, the lesson is extremely painful, and the responsibility I should bear is extremely heavy.
    Liu Yuanjing was an executive committee member of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the chairman of the Construction Industry Association. In his usual work, he feigned enthusiasm; in the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in the industrial and commercial sectors, he also deliberately pretended to be concerned and attentive to this great movement. At the People's Representative Conference, he loudly appealed to construction industry operators to sincerely confess and bravely report. But he himself was a criminal who resolutely refused to confess, pretended to be enthusiastic, and seriously stole state property. I was deceived by his long-term mask. If the government had not previously possessed sufficient, specific materials and concrete evidence, it would have been easy to be fooled by his cunning demeanor.
    However, in the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the government correctly grasped the key to mobilizing the masses. The masses have raised their political enthusiasm and patriotic fervor and, with the attitude of masters of the country, boldly and resolutely reported all acts of corruption and theft, leaving no hiding place for anyone engaging in corruption and theft. The major case of Liu Yuanjing and others stealing state property was exposed because their theft could not escape the eyes of the masses. No matter how calm and cunning they were, they were eventually arrested and brought to justice. Therefore, as Mayor Peng instructed: "In the world of the People's Government, even the slightest corruption is absolutely not allowed; only sincere confession can obtain lenient treatment from the government." Liu Yuanjing and others did not believe in the great power of the people, did not believe in the prestige of the People's Government, and did not believe in Mayor Peng's saying that "words must be believed and actions must be resolute." As a result, he was imprisoned under the government's policy of matching words with deeds.
    The People's Government has always been lenient towards all illegal merchants, giving them ample opportunity to confess and repent. In the vigorous and sweeping anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement, the People's Government repeatedly called on them to confess, repeatedly explaining the policy of "leniency for those who confess, severe punishment for those who refuse to confess," and repeatedly extended the inspection period, which was truly the utmost benevolence and righteousness. However, illegal merchants like Liu Yuanjing harbored illusions, regarded the policies of the People's Government as deceptive, insisted on testing the law with their own bodies, and were determined to be enemies of the people to the end. Although the Federation of Industry and Commerce had repeatedly mobilized him individually, asking him to make a typical speech and take the lead in explaining his illegal activities, he kept procrastinating and confessing incompletely. For the benefit of the broad masses of the people, the government was completely correct to arrest him. We wholeheartedly support such measures.
    Since the launch of the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in the industrial and commercial sectors, I have repeatedly called on all industrialists and businessmen to confess and repent, hoping to save a portion of those who can be saved; on the one hand, I mobilized all trades and industries to ensure that everyone knows the situation, and on the other hand, I asked the Mayor to repeatedly extend the period of leniency. However, I did not discover such a massive theft case as Liu Yuanjing's in advance, nor did I succeed in awakening him to confess consciously, for which I bear a heavy responsibility. From a personal perspective, I failed to help him embark on the path of self-renewal. From a public perspective, I failed to fulfill the task entrusted to me by the government. I can only express my deep pain when Comrade Liu Ren calls a meeting, and I am extremely ashamed of the industrial and commercial sectors. Within the organization, such an unforgivable "committee member" was concealed. I was completely unaware of his serious crimes, which caused such a huge loss to the country, and I should first ask for punishment.
    The major case of Liu Yuanjing and others stealing state property is worthy of vigilance by all of us in the industrial and commercial sectors. As Premier Zhou pointed out: Today, the national bourgeoisie still has its dark and corrupt side, with the essence of pursuing profit, harming others and benefiting oneself, and engaging in speculation. After liberation, some people often steal state property, harm the interests of the people, and corrupt state personnel through illegal activities such as bribery, fraud, exorbitant profits, and tax evasion, in order to achieve the private interests of a few. We can only achieve transformation by thoroughly eliminating such dark and corrupt behaviors. I sincerely hope that everyone will take Liu Yuanjing and others as a warning, abandon their wait-and-see attitude, quickly confess, bravely report, and properly carry out the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement, rescue themselves from the abyss, and never engage in illegal activities again, so as to win glory for the entire industrial and commercial sectors.

    愿工商业者以刘元敬事件为戒，不要再存观望心理，急速坦白不法行为
    北京市工商业联合会主任 傅华亭
    北京市节约检查委员会自一月十二日起开始在工商界中进行全面检查，当天就查出敬业、裕兴等营造厂为贪图暴利，在承包国防建设工程中，勾引干部，施行贿赂，偷工减料，结伙盗窃国家资财八十多亿元的巨案。主犯刘元敬、李善长等罪恶严重，已被政府逮捕法办。在开始检查时就查获了这样的巨大案件，把工商界反贪污、反行贿运动推进了一步，对广大工商业者的教育更为实际，更为深刻。对于我来说，教训是十分惨痛的，我所应负责任是十分沉重的。
    刘元敬是北京市工商业联合会的执行委员、营造业公会的主任委员，平时工作上伪装积极；在工商界的反贪污反行贿的运动中，也故意表现他对这一伟大的运动似乎很关心和重视。在各界人民代表会议上，他又大声疾呼号召营造业者真诚地坦白，勇敢地检举。但他本身就是一个坚决不肯坦白、伪装积极、罪恶严重的盗窃国家财产的罪犯。我被他长期的假面具所蒙蔽，如果政府事先没有掌握充分具体材料和确切证据，也就很容易被他狡猾的作风蒙混过去。
    但是，政府在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争中，正确地掌握了发动群众的关键。群众提高了政治积极性和爱国热情，用主人翁的态度，大胆地坚决地检举一切贪污盗窃行为，使一切有贪污盗窃行为的人无藏身之所。刘元敬等盗窃国家财产的巨案，就是因为他们的盗窃行为不能避开群众的眼睛而被检举出来了。无论他们怎么镇静狡猾，结果还是被逮捕归案了。所以，正如彭市长指示的：“在人民政府的天下，连一点点的贪污，都是绝对不能允许的；只有真诚的坦白，才能获得政府的宽大处理。”刘元敬等不相信人民的巨大力量，不相信人民政府的威信，不相信彭市长说的“言必信，行必果”，于是，他就在政府言出法随的处理下而铃铛入狱了。
    人民政府对待一切不法商人，曾经宽大为怀，给他们以充分坦白悔过的机会。在大张旗鼓雷厉风行的反贪污反行贿运动中，人民政府曾一再号召他们坦白，反复说明“坦白者从轻发落，拒不坦白者依法严惩”的方针，并且把检查期限一再延展，这真是仁至义尽了。可是，刘元敬之流的不法商人，却意存侥幸，视人民政府的政策为可欺，硬要以身试法，决心和人民作对到底。虽经工商业联合会数次对他进行个别动员，要他作典型发言，带头把自己的违法行为交代清楚，他却一味拖延，坦白得很不彻底。政府为着广大人民的利益，把他逮捕起来，是完全正确的。我们衷心拥护这样的措施。
    我在工商界展开反贪污、反行贿运动以来，曾一再向全体工商业者号召坦白悔过，希望挽救一部分可以挽救的人；一方面动员各行各业务必作到家喻户晓，另一方面要求市长一再展期宽大，但我事先却没有发现如刘元敬等的巨大盗窃案，更未能促醒他自觉坦白，是有沉重责任的。就私的方面而论，未能帮助他走向自新之路，就公的方面而论，未能尽到政府所赋予我的任务，只能在刘仁同志召集会议时，表示深刻的痛苦，对工商界而言，也是万分惭愧的。在组织的内部，隐蔽着那样罪不可赦的
    “委员”，我毫未意识到他的严重罪行，使国家遭受到这样巨大的损失，更是首先应该自请处分的。
    刘元敬等盗骗国家财产的巨案，是值得我们全体工商业者警惕的。正如周总理所指出的：今天民族资产阶级还有其黑暗腐朽的一面，具有唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的本质，解放后有一部分人常常以行贿、欺诈、暴利、偷漏等犯法行为，盗窃国家财产，危害人民利益，腐蚀国家工作人员，以遂其少数人的私利。我们惟有彻底肃清那种黑暗腐朽行为，才能获得改造。深盼大家以刘元敬等为戒，不要再存观望心理，赶快坦白，勇敢检举，好好开展反贪污反行贿运动，把自己从深渊中拔救出来，并永远不再有犯法行为，为整个工商业者争取光荣。
