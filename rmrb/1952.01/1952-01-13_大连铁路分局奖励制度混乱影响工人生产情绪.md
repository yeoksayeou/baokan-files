    Dalian Railway Sub-bureau’s Chaotic Reward System Affects Workers' Production Morale
    Editor: The reward system of the Dalian Railway Sub-bureau under the Sino-Soviet Railway Administration is very chaotic. Leading cadres are accumulating award application materials and mishandling bonuses. The Dalian Telegraph Section submitted an award application report in August of last year, but it has not been processed until now due to mutual buck-passing between the Labor and Wages Section and the Personnel Section of the bureau. The award application reports for the Wafangdian Locomotive Depot for July, August, and September were not approved by the bureau until November 16th. Leading cadres of the sub-bureau also often delay handling reward matters designated by the Sino-Soviet Railway Administration. For example, the Administration instructed the sub-bureau director, Hu Yiping, to give appropriate rewards because of the Dalian Sub-bureau's significant achievements in the locomotive dispatching competition; the chairman of the trade union and the director of dispatching also repeatedly urged him, but the sub-bureau has not yet dealt with the matter. The sub-bureau's 47.16 million yuan in Red Banner bonuses for October and regular bonuses for the fourth quarter were handled by the leading cadres without consideration. They ordered Zhang Weitong, an engineer in the Labor and Wages Section, to handle it. Zhang Weitong, without obtaining specific instructions from the leadership or the consent of the trade union, and without cooperating with other sections, subjectively allocated the figures to each section and set a deadline for submission. Due to the urgency of the time, each section and each on-site unit did not have time to evaluate and submitted the numbers indiscriminately, regardless of merit. However, a few units still did not submit the full amount. This resulted in many errors: for example, the Traffic Section reported twenty people but added twelve more; the Personnel Section was given awards even though they did not report any; the Labor and Wages Section, with a total of four people, did not distribute bonuses according to the standards. When the Personnel Section and the sub-bureau's trade union discovered this, they suggested forming a committee to study corrective measures. The leading cadres of the Labor and Wages Section thought that the director's order had already been issued and it would be difficult to overturn it completely, so they only corrected a part of it. Wang Ping, chairman of the trade union, consulted with Director Hu again, who retorted, "Why didn't you say so earlier?" He did not investigate the matter thoroughly. The Labor and Wages Section also made mistakes such as rewarding cadres who had no achievements and giving duplicate awards. These chaotic phenomena in the reward work have affected the production enthusiasm of the workers.

    大连铁路分局奖励制度混乱影响工人生产情绪
    编辑同志：中长铁路管理局大连铁路分局的奖励制度很混乱，领导干部有积压请奖材料和错乱处理奖金的情况。大连电务段在去年八月份呈报了请奖报告，但因局里劳动工资科和人事科互相推诿，拖到现在仍未处理。瓦房店机务段七、八、九三个月份的请奖报告，局里拖到十一月十六日才批下来。分局领导干部对中长铁路管理局指定的奖励事项也常常拖延不办。如管理局因大连分局机车调度竞赛成绩显著，责成分局长胡逸平给予适当奖励；工会主席和调度主任也再三催促，但分局到现在也没有处理这件事。分局十月份的红旗奖金和第四季的经常奖金共四千七百十六万元，领导干部没有考虑，就命令劳动工资科张维桐工程师处理。张维桐既未取得领导方面的具体指示和工会的同意，也不和各科配合，就主观地向各科分配了数字，并限期呈报。由于时间急迫，各科和现场各单位都没有来得及评定，就不分好坏地凑齐数目呈报上去。但是，仍有少数单位没有报齐。这样就发生了很多错误：如车务科报二十名，结果添上十二名；人事科没报也给了奖；劳动工资科共四人，都不按标准发给奖金。人事科和分局工会发觉这件事，就建议组成委员会研究纠正办法。劳动工资科领导干部以为局长命令已发，不好全部推翻，只纠正了一部分。工会主席王萍再找胡局长研究，他反说：“你怎不早说？”对此事仍不深究。劳动工资科还发生过奖励没有成绩的干部，以及重复给奖的错误。这些奖励工作中的混乱现象，已影响了职工的生产积极性。
