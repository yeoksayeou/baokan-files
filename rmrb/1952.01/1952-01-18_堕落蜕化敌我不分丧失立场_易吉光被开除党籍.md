Degenerate and Depraved, Confusing Friend and Foe, Abandoning Principles
Yi Jiguang Expelled from the Party

Yi Jiguang, a member of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and former Deputy Mayor of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, was exposed by the masses for his corruption, extravagance, suppression of democracy, inability to distinguish between friend and foe, and abandonment of principles. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Central South People's Supervision Committee, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPC, and the Wuhan Municipal People's Supervision Committee jointly organized an inspection team to investigate. The investigation is now complete. The results of the investigation indicated that Yi Jiguang's errors were serious, and the Wuhan Municipal Committee has decided to expel him from the Party. At the Second Session of the Second Wuhan Municipal People's Representative Conference held from December 25th to 28th last year, Yi Jiguang was removed from his positions as Deputy Mayor, Government Committee member, and Secretary-General.

Yi Jiguang was a Communist Party member with over 20 years of party membership, holding significant responsibilities within the Party and in administrative roles. Under the leadership of the Party, he contributed to the revolution and the people. However, after the victory of the revolution, unable to resist the corruption of bourgeois ideology, he became arrogant, complacent, lax, corrupt, and suppressed criticism, completely losing the principles and qualities of a Communist Party member.

During his long tenure as Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, Yi Jiguang directly led the work of the Production and Education Center. Due to his personal plans, he mistakenly gave 10,000 articles of clothing, two large truckloads of shoes, assets from the Shantang Guild worth 400 million yuan (including 15,000 jin of grain), four weaving machines, and ten towel machines, which were raised to relieve victims of the fire in the Wuhan Municipality reconstruction area, to the Production and Education Center without any reason.

Yi Jiguang could not distinguish between friend and foe, and he greatly trusted and heavily employed individuals with political problems and unclear histories. Jiang Ming, a Kuomintang secret agent who had served as a puppet commissioner and puppet mayor, suppressed peasant movements, and had blood debts, was appointed by Yi Jiguang as Acting Section Chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and later promoted to Secretary-General of the Relief Branch, and sent to Shanghai to attend the national relief and welfare conference convened by the central government (Jiang Ming has been arrested in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve). Xu Shiyin had served as a puppet county magistrate and puppet tax bureau director, and suppressed student movements. Yi Jiguang also allowed him to serve as the head of the document group in the Civil Affairs Bureau, drafting important documents, and later promoted him to administrative secretary of the Production and Education Center (Xu Shiyin was arrested in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve). Wang Yongcheng was originally a code clerk for the "Central China剿匪 Headquarters" in Huangchuan, and was promoted by Yi Jiguang from clerk to factory director of a factory in the Production and Education Center, and later promoted to acting secretary-director of the Production and Education Center. Yi Zichao (Yi Jiguang's younger brother) was a local bully in Yichang and had served as the deputy captain of the criminal police team of the puppet police station. Regarding such a reactionary element, Yi Jiguang first requested the Wuhan Municipal People's Government to write a letter to the Yichang Municipal People's Government to take care of him. Last year, after Yi Zichao came to Hankou, Yi Jiguang introduced him to a job, but Yi Zichao resigned because he felt the position was too low. Yi Jiguang then took 2 million yuan from public funds to give him to return home to do business. Soon, Yi Zichao came to Hankou again, and Yi Jiguang gave him another 300,000 yuan. Later, Yi Zichao was also arrested in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. In addition, Yi Jiguang and Lang Qinxiang also heavily used bad elements as backbone cadres of the United Association of Guilds and Shantangs, resulting in corruption and other problems. Yi Jiguang had an improper relationship with a female doctor surnamed Wu. Wu's father was a member of the Kuomintang district branch, and when he was placed under our control last February, Yi Jiguang personally wrote a letter to the Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau to prevent the control. In April, during the high tide of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Wu's father committed suicide out of fear of punishment. Yi Jiguang took a car to the funeral home with Wu's relatives to take care of the arrangements, and sent two cadres to transport the coffin to the Shekou cemetery in a truck from the Production and Education Center. The above situation fully illustrates that Yi Jiguang could not distinguish between friend and foe in politics and completely lost the principles and qualities of a Communist Party member. Yi Jiguang's erroneous behavior has created a very bad influence among cadres and the masses, causing great losses to the work of the Party.

Yi Jiguang's ideas of corruption and enjoyment were extremely serious. When he was the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau and Deputy Mayor of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, he abused his power and squandered public funds, spending more than 22 million yuan for his own use, most of which was used to purchase food, cigarettes, and clothing. The cigars he smoked were worth 2,000 to 5,000 yuan each. He was also very particular about the house he lived in. After he became Secretary-General, he and Deputy Mayor Zhou Jifang found a good house, with monthly expenses of about 9 million yuan for rent and utilities. They also set up a separate guard squad and work group, plus their original guards and clerks, for a total of 43 people to serve them. But Yi Jiguang was not satisfied with such a life, still considered life "hard," and scolded the clerks for "not taking care of the leaders." Because Yi Jiguang had completely degenerated, he disregarded the national financial system and made excessive expenditures. For example, during his long tenure as Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, he withdrew more than 29.43 million yuan from social welfare funds over the course of more than a year, which was excessively used to repair cars, decorate buildings, for the Civil Affairs Bureau cadres to collectively watch plays, to reissue food allowances, and for cadre subsidies. In addition, Yi Jiguang privately used more than 50 million yuan of public funds from the Production and Education Center without anyone's approval to buy a small jeep for his wife, Liu Jing. He also privately distributed more than 2 million yuan in subsidies from the city-wide cadre family subsidy grain from the previous and current years to the families of his bully brother and sister. Yi also sent a grand-nephew (Yi Zichao's son) to Wuhan Municipal No. 2 Boys' Middle School without the approval of the personnel department of the Wuhan Municipal Government, enjoying cadre children's treatment, and receiving contracted fees in the Civil Affairs Bureau.

In addition, under the guidance of a strong profit-seeking perspective, Yi Jiguang misappropriated the funds of the Shantang Guild and blindly established a yarn factory. Because prior consideration was insufficient, the yarn spinning machines were stored in the warehouse for a year after being transported to Wuhan without being used for production. The original 80 factory workers were still paid their salaries without working, resulting in a total loss of more than 2 billion yuan. At the same time, it affected the promotion of the Shantang Guild's relief and welfare undertakings. Liu, the daughter of a former mayor of Changsha, was rescued after attempting suicide by jumping into the river due to a love affair. Yi Jiguang excused her as an intellectual with a future, and kept her in the bureau to live with the female cadres, and allowed her to enter and exit Yi's office at will, and asked cadres to accompany her to dance and watch movies.

Yi Jiguang was also prominent in suppressing democracy and criticism. He falsely accused the criticism of the masses as "deliberate revenge," "impure motives," "bad people taking advantage of loopholes," and "undermining the prestige of the leadership," and even slandered workers who offered opinions as "hooligan workers." Yi Jiguang often used the pretext of opposing "liberalism," "egalitarianism," and "extreme democracy" to oppose democracy and criticism.

The cadres of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government had many opinions about Yi Jiguang, but Yi never listened to these opinions. For example, at the heart-to-heart talk meeting held by the Civil Affairs Bureau in December 1949, everyone raised many opinions about Yi Jiguang's bureaucratic style. In the year-end work summary report, Yi Jiguang severely criticized those who offered opinions, saying that everyone was "liberal," "egalitarian," "extremely democratic," "stirring up trouble," and "afraid that the world would not be in chaos." After that, Yi Jiguang continuously retaliated against those who offered opinions. Qiao Quande was disqualified from the Party branch committee because he offered many opinions, and his job was transferred. Hu Zemin was also attacked by Yi Jiguang because he often offered opinions. Yi Jiguang also publicly scolded Hu Zemin for having a "hooligan style" and being a "roaming hustler."

Yi Jiguang's mistakes are serious. After the victory of the revolution, under the influence of bourgeois ideology, he forgot the Party's tradition of hard struggle, left the position of the working class, and thus degenerated and deteriorated, completely losing the class position and noble qualities that a Communist Party member should have. The decision of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPC to expel him from the Party is completely correct.

Yi Jiguang himself should bear the main responsibility for Yi Jiguang's mistakes; in the past, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPC and the Wuhan Municipal People's Government did not conduct strict struggles against Yi Jiguang's mistakes, and should also conduct inspections.

### 堕落蜕化敌我不分丧失立场  易吉光被开除党籍

    堕落蜕化敌我不分丧失立场
    易吉光被开除党籍
    中共武汉市委员会委员、原武汉市人民政府副市长易吉光，腐化堕落，铺张浪费，压制民主，敌我不分，丧失立场的错误被群众揭发后，中共中央中南局纪律检查委员会、中南人民监察委员会、中共武汉市委纪律检查委员会、武汉市人民监察委员会等单位曾联合组织检查组前往检查，现已检查完毕。检查结果指明，易吉光错误严重，武汉市委已决定开除其党籍。去年十二月二十五日至二十八日举行的武汉市第二届第二次各界人民代表会，罢免了易吉光的副市长、政府委员和秘书长等本兼各职。
    易吉光是有二十多年党龄的共产党员，在党内和行政方面都负有相当重要的责任。他在党的领导下为革命为人民出过力；但在革命胜利后，因经不起资产阶级思想的腐蚀，骄傲自满，麻痹松懈，腐化堕落，压制批评，已完全丧失了共产党员的立场和品质。
    易吉光在任武汉市人民政府民政局长期内，直接领导生产教养院的工作。由于他有个人打算，曾错误地把募集救济武汉市重划区火灾区灾民的衣服一万件，鞋子两大卡车，以及善堂会馆的资产四亿元
    （内粮食一万五千斤折款）及织布机四部，毛巾机十部等等，都毫无理由地给了生产教养院。
    易吉光敌我不分，对有政治问题、历史不清的分子非常信任，加以重用。曾充当过伪专员、伪市长、镇压过农民运动，血债累累的军统特务蒋铭，就被易吉光任为民政局民政科代理科长，后提升为救济分会的秘书长，并派到上海去参加中央召开的全国救济福利会议（在镇压反革命中，蒋铭已被捕，判处死刑，缓期二年执行）。徐石音曾充当过伪县长及伪税务局局长，镇压过学生运动，易吉光也让他担任民政局文书组组长，起草重要文电，后又提升他为生产教养院行政秘书（徐石音在镇压反革命运动中被捕，判处死刑，缓期二年执行）。王永成原是“华中剿总”潢川小组译电员，也由易吉光从办事员提升为生产教养院的一个厂的厂长，后又提升为生产教养院的代理秘书主任。易子超（易吉光的胞弟）是宜昌的一个恶霸，曾充当过伪警察局刑事队队副。对这样一个反动分子，易吉光先是要求武汉市人民政府写信给宜昌市人民政府予以照顾；去年易子超来汉口后，易吉光又给他介绍工作，而易子超则嫌地位低而辞职。易吉光遂从公款中拿出二百万元给他回家作生意。不久，易子超又来汉口，易吉光又送给他三十万元。后易子超在镇压反革命中也被捕。此外，易吉光和郎勤襄又重用坏分子为会馆善堂联合会骨干干部，因而发生了贪污等问题。易吉光和一个吴姓女医生有暧昧关系，吴的父亲是国民党区分部委员，去年二月被我管制时，易吉光曾亲自写信给武汉市公安局，不让管制。四月间，正值镇压反革命运动高潮时，吴父畏罪自杀，易吉光乘汽车协同吴的亲属到殡仪馆去照料，并派两个干部用生产教养院的卡车运送灵柩至滠口墓地。上述情况已充分说明易吉光在政治上敌我不分，完全丧失了共产党员的立场和品质。易吉光的这种错误行为，在干部和群众中造成了极坏的影响，使党的工作受到了极大的损失。
    易吉光的腐化享乐思想极为严重。他在任武汉市人民政府民政局长、副市长时，利用职权滥用公款，仅其自用的就有二千二百多万元，这些钱多数用于购买食品、香烟、衣服之类。他吸的雪茄烟，每支值二千到五千元。他住的房子也很讲究。他在担任秘书长后，就和周季方副市长找了一幢好房屋，每月开支房租、水电费九百万元左右。他们并单设警卫班、工作组，加上他们原来的警卫员、公务员等等，两个人就有四十三个人来伺候。但是易吉光对这样的生活还不满足，还认为生活“苦”，斥责事务员“不会照顾首长”。易吉光由于已完全蜕化，无视国家财政制度，滥行开支。如易在任民政局长期内，在一年多的过程中曾提取社会事业费二千九百四十三万多元，滥用于修理汽车、修饰楼房、民政局干部集体看戏、补发伙食费、干部补助费等。另外，易吉光未经任何人批准，私自动用生产教养院公款五千多万元为自己的妻子刘静买了一辆小吉普车。私自从前年、去年的全市干部家属补助粮内，发给自己的恶霸兄弟、姐姐的家属补助费二百多万元。易又未经武汉市政府人事处的批准，将一个大侄儿（易子超之子）送入武汉市立第二男中上学，享受干部子弟待遇，在民政局内领取包干费。
    此外，易吉光又在浓厚的营利观点的指导下，挪用善堂会馆的经费，盲目举办纱厂。因事先考虑不周，纱锭机器运武汉后，堆在仓库达一年之久未用于生产，原厂职工八十余人未作工作而仍照发工薪，共计损失达二十亿元以上。同时影响了善堂会馆救济福利事业的推进。伪长沙市长刘某之女，因失恋投江被救，易吉光藉口她是知识分子，有前途，便留在局内和女干部住在一起，并任其随意出入易的办公室，并叫干部陪她跳舞、看电影等。
    易吉光在压制民主、压制批评方面也很突出。他把群众的批评诬为“有意报复”，“动机不纯”，“坏人钻空子”，“破坏领导威信”，甚至诬蔑提意见的工人为“流氓工人”。易吉光常常藉口反对“自由主义”“平均主义”“极端民主”来反对民主，反对批评。
    武汉市人民政府民政局的干部对易吉光的意见很多，但易从来不听取这些意见。例如在一九四九年十二月民政局召开的谈心会上，大家对易吉光的官僚主义作风提出了很多意见，易吉光在年终工作总结报告中，就对提意见的人大骂一顿。说大家是“自由主义”“平均主义”“极端民主”“兴风作浪”“唯恐天下不乱”等。此后易吉光对提意见的人不断地施行报复。乔全德因为提意见多就被易吉光取消了党总支委员的资格，并调动了工作。胡泽民也因为常提意见，遭到易吉光的打击。易吉光并公开骂胡泽民有“流氓作风”，是“跑江湖的”。
    易吉光的错误是严重的。在革命胜利后，在资产阶级思想影响下，他已经忘记了党的艰苦奋斗的传统，离开了工人阶级的立场，因而蜕化变质，完全丧失了共产党员所应有的阶级立场和崇高的品质，中共武汉市委决定开除其党籍是完全正确的。
    易吉光的错误，他本人应该负主要责任；过去，中共武汉市委会和武汉市人民政府对易吉光的错误未进行严格斗争，也应该进行检查。
