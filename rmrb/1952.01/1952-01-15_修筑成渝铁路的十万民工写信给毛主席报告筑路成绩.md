Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 14th: The 100,000 workers building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway wrote to Chairman Mao in the New Year, reporting on their construction achievements over the past year. In their letter, they said:

    We, the 100,000 Chengdu-Chongqing Railway construction workers, have victoriously completed nearly all of the roadbed engineering by the end of 1951. On this New Year's occasion, we would like to offer this achievement as a gift to you.

    The letter, after describing how they came from rural areas of Sichuan to the construction site to build the road in response to the call of the People's Government, said: The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway line was originally full of hills and deep gullies, but in the past year, we farmers, who were used to sickles and plows, have transformed it into a flat avenue. We have universally received education in speaking out bitterness and patriotic education in resisting America and aiding Korea, and launched a "five comparisons movement" comparing engineering, work efficiency, safety, savings, and progress. We have also gradually become familiar with the technology and progressed from a scattered and disorganized state to unity and mutual assistance, and discipline. We have never bowed our heads under any difficult conditions. Mountains have been cut in half, gullies have been filled, and difficulties have been overcome.

    The letter also said: In the past year or so, under the slogan of "learning from the spirit of the Volunteers in overcoming difficulties," we have launched a movement to study technology and improve tools, creating and improving hundreds of tools and work methods, increasing work efficiency from the standard of 0.8 standard work units per person per day to 1.8 standard work units. Yan Shaogui, a civilian worker from northern Sichuan who attended the National Railway Labor Model Conference, improved the form of the drill bit and created a single-person drilling method, increasing work efficiency from the original ten meters of drill holes per day for two people to twenty-eight meters per day per person, and now even forty-nine meters of drill holes per day per person. Because we adopted the Soviet advanced soil-filling and ramming road construction method, Li Huimin, a civilian worker from southern Sichuan, created a lever-type ramming machine, changing the original four people ramming one tamp to one person ramming one tamp. These creations have enabled us to build the roadbed quickly and well, and also saved the country more than 10 billion yuan in wealth.

    The letter reported to Chairman Mao on their living conditions, saying: In the past year or so, very few of us have been sick. People who were pale and thin before have now become strong, and people who used to wear ragged clothes are now wearing new cotton-padded clothes inside and out. Most people have savings of more than several hundred thousand yuan. Before returning home, everyone purchased farm tools and draft animals. During the road construction period, our families also received preferential treatment. Mutual aid groups helped with farming, and neighbors came to visit and express their regards during festivals. During the New Year, neighboring farmers brought sheep and wine to the construction site to celebrate with us. They said: "Hurry up and build the railway so that we can get some machines to the village to farm the land in the future." These cares and words made us realize even more that we are building a railway to a happy paradise for everyone!

    The letter concluded: Now, except for the civilian workers in western Sichuan who still have some projects to continue to complete, and 8,000 people who have been approved by the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau to be retained as formal railway workers, most of us have returned to our hometowns to engage in agricultural production. We have agreed that no matter where we work, we must resolutely implement your instructions, increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers. Those who stay in the railway work should strive to be industrial labor models, and those who return to the countryside should strive to be agricultural labor models.

    修筑成渝铁路的十万民工写信给毛主席报告筑路成绩
    【新华社重庆十四日电】修筑成渝铁路的全体十万民工，在新年上书毛主席，报告他们一年多来筑路的成绩。他们在信中说：
    我们成渝铁路十万筑路民工，已经在一九五一年年底，胜利地完成了将近全部的路基工程，当此新年之际，我们愿把这个成绩作为对你的献礼。
    这信在叙述他们为响应人民政府号召从四川各地农村来到工地筑路的情形后说：成渝铁路沿线原来都是山丘和深沟，但是，一年来，我们这些使惯了镰刀和犁头的庄稼人，已经把它修成了一条平坦大道。我们普遍地受到了诉苦和抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，开展了比工程、比工效、比安全、比节约、比进步的“五比运动”。我们也就逐渐熟悉了技术，并从散漫无组织状态进步到团结互助，遵守纪律了。在任何困难条件下我们都没有低过头。山被腰斩了，沟被填平了，困难都被克服了。
    这信又说：一年多来，我们还在“学习志愿军克服困难的精神”的口号下，展开钻研技术、改进工具的运动，创造和改进了几百种工具和工作方法，使工作效率从每人每日只能做零点八的标准工提高到一点八的标准工。曾出席全国铁路劳动模范会议的川北民工颜绍贵改进炮钎形式，创造单人打炮法，使工作效率从原先每两个人每天打炮眼十多公尺提高到每人每天打二十八公尺，现在甚至一个人一天能打炮眼四十九公尺。由于我们采用了苏联先进填土打夯筑路法，川南民工李惠民又创造了杠杆式打夯机，原先四个人打一个夯，后来就改成一个人打一个夯了。这些创造，使我们把路基修筑得又快又好，还为国家节省了百亿元以上的财富。
    这信向毛主席报告他们的生活情况说：一年多来，我们很少有人生过病，从前面黄肌瘦的人现在也都变得结实了，过去穿着拖一块吊一片的破旧衣服的人也都穿上里外三新的棉衣了。一般人都有了几十万元以上的储蓄，在返乡前大家都购置了农具和耕畜。筑路期中，我们家里也受到了优待，互助组帮助耕种，逢年过节时左邻右舍还登门慰问。年节里，附近农民兄弟牵羊挑酒来工地和我们联欢。他们说：“赶快修好铁路，将来好运几架机器来庄上耕田。”这些照顾和话语，更使我们了解到：我们是在为大家修筑一条通往幸福乐园去的铁路啊！
    这信最后说：现在，除川西的民工还有一部分工程需要继续完成，有八千人经西南铁路工程局批准已留作正式铁路工人外，我们大都返乡搞农业生产去了。我们已经约定，不管是在那里工作，都要坚决执行你的指示，增加生产，厉行节约，支援人民志愿军。留在铁路工作的要争取当工业劳动模范，回到农村的要争取当农业劳动模范。
