    To the Editor: The entire school building project of Beijing Municipal Eighth Middle School was contracted to the Beijing Construction Engineering Company. Not long after these projects were completed, we discovered many problems. For example, the dormitory foundations are sinking; the walls connecting the rooms have cracks as wide as a finger; there are countless large potholes in the concrete pavement of the walkways; the most serious problem is that the entire roof leaks, and the plaster ceiling of the teachers' dormitory has even fallen down. This company also cut corners on materials. For example, the copper hooks used on the window frames are all of inferior quality. After the Eighth Middle School discovered these problems, it sent Deng Congzheng to negotiate with the company. Deng first went to the design department under the company, but Sun Chunyuan, the director of the design department, said, "We don't handle construction problems, that's the business of the construction department." Deng then went to the department in charge of construction, where Zhang Xianqiao, the office director of the construction department, said that he was new and didn't know the details, and told Deng to find Shen Rusong, the construction site director of the Eighth Middle School. Deng found Shen Rusong, who actually said, "This is a problem with the design, we'll see about it later." He also ignored the allegations of cutting corners on materials. This back-and-forth passing of responsibility made it impossible to resolve the issue. I believe that the Beijing Construction Engineering Company should be responsible for the warranty of the projects it contracts, and I hope they will thoroughly investigate the wastefulness at the Eighth Middle School construction site.

    北京市建筑工程公司应检查承包的第八中学的工程
    编辑同志：北京市立第八中学全部校舍修建工程是由北京市建筑工程公司承包的。这些工程完工不久，我们就发现了很多毛病。如宿舍房基下沉；房和房相接的墙裂了一指头宽的大缝；甬道洋灰地有数不清的大坑；最严重的是全部房顶漏雨，教职员宿舍的灰顶竟掉下来了。这个公司也偷工减料。如窗户口的铜钩用的都是劣货。第八中学检查出这些问题后，就派邓从政到公司交涉。邓先到公司所属的设计部门，但设计部门的主任孙春元说：“施工问题我们不管，这是施工部的事。”邓又到管施工的部门，施工部门办公室主任张仙桥说，他是新来的，不知道内情，叫邓去找第八中学工地主任沈汝松。邓找到了沈汝松，沈汝松竟说：“这是设计上的毛病，等将来看了再说。”他对所提偷工减料事，也不加理睬。这样推来推去，使问题没法解决。我认为北京市建筑工程公司应对所包的工程负保固责任，并希望他们彻查第八中学工地的浪费情形。
