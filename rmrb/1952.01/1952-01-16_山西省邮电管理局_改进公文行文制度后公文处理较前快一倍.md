    Public Document Processing Speed Doubles After Improving Official Document Procedures
    To the Editor: In response to the call for "increasing production and practicing economy," the staff of the Shanxi Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration improved the official document procedures, and the processing of public documents is more than twice as fast as before.
    In the past, the bureau's processing of official documents, regardless of their nature, had to go through twelve procedures before they could be completed. Section chiefs were mostly trapped in the circle of事務ism, and sometimes rarely considered major issues.
    In view of the above situation, the General Office of the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration has improved the official document procedures and system, stipulating that three types of public documents—A, B (bearing policy and directional nature), and C (ordinary)—should be processed separately. Documents of type A and B should be handled with caution, while documents of type C should be directly received and sent by the section and handed over to the person in charge. After one review by the section chief, they will be transcribed and issued. After this implementation, in general, incoming documents can be processed on the same day, which is more than twice as fast as before.

    山西省邮电管理局
    改进公文行文制度后公文处理较前快一倍
    编辑同志：山西省邮电管理局职工为了响应“增产节约”的号召，改进了公文行文制度，公文的处理较前快了一倍多时间。
    局里过去处理公文，不论什么性质，必须经过十二道手续，才能处理完毕。科长们多半陷入了事务主义的圈子，有时对大的问题反而很少考虑。
    根据上述情形，省邮电管理局办公室已经改进了行文手续和制度，规定：甲、乙（带方针、政策性的）、丙（普通的）三种公文分别处理，对甲、乙两种公文应慎重办理，对丙种公文，就直接由科收发送交承办人办理。科长一次审查后，就缮写发出。这样实行后，一般的都能作到当天来文，当天处理，比较以前快一倍多时间。
