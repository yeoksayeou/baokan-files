Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, January 10th: TASS reports that the purely Catholic Social Party government of Belgium resigned on the 9th. The resignation of this government, headed by Pholien, was not due to a vote of no confidence in parliament, but because of divisions within the ruling Catholic Social Party. These divisions arose from the serious economic and financial difficulties encountered by the Belgian government in pursuing the arms expansion policy assigned by the rulers of the Atlantic aggressive bloc.

The infighting within the Belgian Catholic reactionaries reflects the growing dissatisfaction of the Belgian working masses with the government's current policies. This friction became more acute after the widespread wave of strikes by Belgian workers in October of last year. At that time, the Pholien government, under pressure from the striking workers, had to make some insignificant concessions, somewhat increasing wages and social benefits. However, despite the fact that the wage increases lagged far behind the sharp rise in the prices of necessities, the right wing of the Catholic Social Party still attacked the Pholien government, accusing it of being too "soft" and too "compliant" with the workers. The policy of the extreme right wing of the Belgian Catholic Social Party is not to alleviate the economic oppression of the workers.

Brussels democrats also believe that the resignation of the Pholien government is directly related to disagreements within the ruling group over the implementation of the United States' order for Belgium to increase its military spending. It is known that the Belgian government had to reject this demand from the United States because of economic difficulties.

    执行备战政策遭到严重困难
    比天主教社会党政府垮台
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社布鲁塞尔十日讯：比利时清一色的天主教社会党政府已于九日辞职。以福廉为首的这个政府的辞职，不是因为议会投不信任票，而是因为执政的天主教社会党内部发生了分歧。这种分歧，是因为比利时政府在奉行大西洋侵略集团统治者所指派的扩张军备政策方面碰到了严重的经济财政困难而产生的。
    比利时天主教反动派内部的倾轧，反映了比利时劳动大众对政府现行政策的日益不满。在去年十月，比利时工人鼓起广泛的罢工浪潮以后，这种摩擦越发尖锐了。当时福廉政府在罢工工人的压迫下，不得不作了一些微不足道的让步，多多少少提高了工资和社会补助费。可是尽管工资的提高远远赶不上生活必需品价格的剧烈上涨，天主教社会党的右翼仍然攻击福廉政府，指责它对工人太“软弱”、太“顺从”。比利时天主教社会党极右翼的方针是不减轻对工人的经济压迫。
    布鲁塞尔民主人士也认为，福廉政府的辞职，和执政集团在执行美国要比利时增加军事拨款的命令一事上发生分歧有直接的关系。大家知道，比利时政府因为碰到经济困难，不得不拒绝了美国的这种要求。
