    After Reading Stalin's "The International Character of the October Revolution"
    Li Jinxi, Head of the Chinese Department, Beijing Normal University, Central Director of the Jiusan Society
    This is an article that clearly explains the fundamental transformation of the objective world. After reading it, we must first thoroughly review our past erroneous views on the Chinese revolution: In the past, some regarded the nature of the Chinese revolution as "changing dynasties," some regarded it as reforming the political system (during the Xinhai Revolution) or overthrowing feudal culture (during the May Fourth Movement), and there was a failure to recognize the anti-imperialist and anti-fascist nature of the War of Resistance Against Japan. This series of erroneous views must be fundamentally eliminated. It must be recognized that the Chinese revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party over the past thirty years has the same "international character" as the October Revolution, and is a great practical activity to transform the objective world based on the scientific truth of Marxism-Leninism.
    By carefully studying this article, we must thoroughly "transform our cognitive abilities and transform the relationship between the subjective world and the objective world" (On Practice) rationally.
    In order to demonstrate the impact of the October Revolution on the development of revolutionary movements worldwide, this article points out four basic issues, and we can review our past (most recent past) views point by point:
    (1) The October Revolution broke through the world imperialist bourgeoisie's front line and successfully established and consolidated a socialist proletarian regime, deprived landlords and capitalists of the means of production and materials, and turned them into social public property. This specifically shattered the "old theory" that "the exploited cannot do without the exploiters, just as the brain and other limbs cannot do without the stomach." Although we used to believe that the world would be socialist in the future, we always regarded it as an ideal world and did not positively value the new regime established and consolidated after the Soviet October Revolution, and could not truly recognize that it was a concrete manifestation of this ideal world. Therefore, we were always in a state of bewilderment and confusion regarding the "deceptive" old theory that had been "fatally hit." Now that we have our own new regime, the scientific truth of the October Revolution has been further confirmed, and we can no longer lack firm confidence.
    What is the fundamental difference between the October Revolution and all previous revolutions? "Its purpose is not to replace one form of exploitation with another, to replace one group of exploiters with another, but to eliminate the phenomenon of anyone exploiting anyone else, to eliminate all groups of exploiters, and to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. ..." Now that we have also established our own new regime, we must consolidate it, and we must be especially vigilant: The world imperialist bourgeoisie's front in the Far East has been "broken through," and they will never be reconciled to this; therefore, we should have no doubts about "suppressing counter-revolutionaries." The primary task of the new regime itself is to gradually "eliminate the phenomenon of anyone exploiting anyone else," and we should have no doubts about "land reform."
    (2) The October Revolution struck the rear and outer vassals of imperialism, and shook the rule of imperialism in various colonies and dependent countries; it took the lead in "setting an example" by "carrying out national colonial revolutions" domestically. The Soviet Union "was not for nationalism, but for internationalism," and "the proletariat cannot liberate itself unless it also liberates the oppressed nations," so it first gave all nationalities within the country genuine freedom and equality, mutual trust and closeness, which greatly influenced the development of revolutionary movements among oppressed nations in colonies and dependent countries around the world, and ended the era of imperialism's "safe exploitation and safe oppression of colonies and dependent countries." The misunderstandings and doubts that ordinary Chinese people had about a series of factual issues in the Soviet Union in the past should be fundamentally "dissipated" after reading this article.
    Here, we can also discuss a question about the current international situation, that is, we should have a clear and concrete understanding of the "peaceful coexistence of the socialist state system and the capitalist state system." Since the October Revolution "opened up a new era, namely the era of colonial revolution in which all oppressed countries of the world united with the proletariat and were carried out under the leadership of the proletariat," and this era has extended to the present, the revolutionary struggles in the colonies on which capitalist countries rely have become more acute. Under the current international situation, how is "peaceful coexistence" between the two systems possible? At the "Second Session of the World Peace Council" held in Vienna last November, five of the eight political resolutions were to solve this critical "regional issue," and two principles were resolved, namely "national self-determination" and "withdrawal of foreign troops," and it was advocated that "peaceful negotiations should be used to resolve" it. When we study Stalin's "The International Character of the October Revolution" and read this article, it seems that we can discuss this international dispute, which is the most numerous and related to the principles of world revolution, in conjunction with relevant documents, and at the same time, we can have a clearer and more concrete understanding of the conditions under which the two systems can "peacefully coexist."
    (3) The October Revolution brought the entire existence of world capitalism into question, because the unbalanced development of capitalism led to the First World War—the imperialist massacre. The development of capitalism has turned from its peak to a downward path, and is on the process of decay and decline. At this moment, a major country concretely demonstrated the fact of breaking away from the capitalist world system, which accelerated this process; at the same time, on the one hand, it established a strong and open central base for the world's anti-imperialist revolutionary movement, enabling the world's proletariat and oppressed nations to unite around this center and form a revolutionary united front against imperialism, so the foundation of the entire world capitalism—imperialism—was fundamentally shaken from then on, and it could no longer be "peaceful" and "stable," "patching" was ineffective, and its "weight" gradually lightened. The October Revolution really opened a new era for the demise of capitalism. Those of us who have studied Lenin's "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism" should be able to have an in-depth and detailed understanding of this article. However, since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in August 1950, the general public still has wrong perceptions of the United States. Although those who had pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American thoughts and were unwilling to "hate" it have decreased, there are still some doubts about "despising" and "scorn," and they have not yet recognized that it is already on a downward path. Looking back further to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our understanding of the United States was even more completely wrong, and our understanding of the two major camps formed by the two basic directions in post-war international politics was too insufficient. In fact, these two camps have been analyzed very clearly in the third article of this article. This article was published as early as 1927, and we had seen it at the latest during the War of Resistance Against Japan (after 1937), but we were indifferent at the time, so that when the War of Resistance Against Japan was won, it was as Chairman Mao said, "It would be a great mistake to underestimate the significance of the victory of the Second World War." (See "Unite All Revolutionary Forces of the World to Oppose Imperialist Aggression") We are in the process of the Chinese revolution over the past thirty years, precisely because we did not understand the fundamental nature of these two major camps and their relationship with us, and did not decide which position we should take, which blurred the distinction between the enemy and ourselves, and we had already committed a "great mistake"; by the time of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the erroneous views became even more serious. It was not until after liberation, when the Resist America, Aid Korea movement was launched, that we gradually woke up from our studies. Now that we read this article, we should be more keenly aware.
    (4) This point is even more important, namely: Marxism has triumphed over reformism. This "is another revolution in 'wisdom,'" and in the Soviet Union at that time, it was a revolution in the thinking of the working class. Ordinary reformists can also wave the banner of Marxism, but they do not conduct revolutionary struggles against the reactionary class, and they are unwilling to find ways to promote the realization of the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Like the Social Democratic Party at that time, it could superficially "mix with Marxism," but for the class enemies of Marxism, it "is not dangerous at all." When the October Revolution sounded, the dictatorship of the proletariat triumphed, and there was a "deep abyss" between them, and they gradually ran into the enemy's camp and became the "ideological pillars" of the reactionaries. Therefore, Lenin scolded the Social Democratic Party "politicians" at the time as "the real running dogs of the bourgeoisie in the workers' movement, the agents of the capitalist class among the workers"; "in the proletarian anti-bourgeois civil war," they would inevitably stand "on the side of the Versailles faction against the members of the Paris Commune."
    The Chinese Communist Party, which has led the Chinese revolution for the past thirty years, was established after the Soviet October Revolution. From the very beginning, it followed Lenin's principles, and until now, its ideology and organization have not been influenced by the Second International of the European Social Democratic Party, nor has it gone through a period of peaceful struggle in parliament like in Europe, nor has it had a class of labor aristocracy like in Europe (according to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's 1941 discussion of intra-party struggle). When the country was basically liberated, the revolution was victorious, and the reactionary regime was overthrown, there were still a group of intellectuals in society who stood on the position of the reactionary class—reformists. When we have not carefully studied this article, we cannot feel that we are exactly the kind of people in the fourth point that Comrade Stalin said, although the situation is not exactly the same as that of the Social Democratic Party of the Soviet Union. Lenin also said: "The essence of general reformism is to only advocate the implementation of changes that do not necessarily eliminate the main foundations of the old ruling class, changes that are compatible with the preservation of these foundations." (See Lenin's "Several Controversial Issues") Like me, who thought that I had been concentrating on the "Chinese character reform movement" for more than thirty years, it has always played a certain progressive role in social development, setting aside the political position and isolating "revolution" and "reform" for use in technology and social movement methods and plans; after learning, I confirmed that I was able to "peacefully coexist" and carry out the character reform movement under the reactionary rule of the Northern Warlords and the Kuomintang over the years, and I am really an "unadulterated reformist" from beginning to end: knowing that this kind of "change" is not successful, then that is "defeatism"; if this kind of "change" is really successful, then it is even further "accomplice." Especially having taught and worked at Beijing Normal University for more than thirty years, before participating in the activities of the Jiusan Society, it can be said that I was completely serving the reactionary ruling class, and had many bad effects and influences on young people, which is even beyond "reformism." Now we should deeply realize that the liberation of China is the victory of Marxism over reformism, which is not only a revolution in economic relations and socio-political relations, but also a revolution in "wisdom."
    Why did the Chinese revolution turn into a new democratic revolution after the "October Revolution"? Because "the victory of the October Revolution is a fundamental transformation in human history, ... a fundamental transformation in the methods and forms of organization of struggle, lifestyles and traditions, culture and ideological system of the exploited masses of the world." And "the Chinese revolution is a part of the world revolution," and the new democratic revolution is based on the scientific truth of Marxism-Leninism, following this fundamental transformation of the world and adapting to China's national conditions.
    In the past, our understanding of the nature of the October Revolution was vague, so our understanding of the correct direction of the Soviet Union and the Chinese revolution over the past thirty years has also been vague. We did not understand or did not believe in the scientific truth of transforming the objective world, and in the process of these thirty years of revolution, we did not distinguish between the enemy, ourselves, and our friends, fell into reformism, and stood on the reactionary class position without realizing it. Now, we can only learn from scratch, thoroughly review, and recognize that the "me" of the past is the "enemy" of today!

    读了斯大林“十月革命底国际性质”以后
    北京师范大学中文系主任  九三学社中央理事  黎锦熙
    这是一篇明确地说明客观世界根本转变的文章。读过之后，首先要把我们过去对于中国革命的错误看法从头检讨一番：过去对于中国革命的性质，有的认为是“改朝换代”，有的认为是改革政体（辛亥革命时）或打倒封建文化（五四运动时），以及没有认识抗日战争的反帝国主义反法西斯战争的性质，这一连串错误的看法，都应该根本清除。必须认识三十年来中国共产党领导的中国革命就是和十月革命有同样的“国际性质”的，就是根据马克思、列宁主义的科学真理来改造客观世界的一个伟大的实践活动。
    我们精读这篇文章，就是要从理性上彻底“改造自己的认识能力，改造主观世界同客观世界的关系”（实践论）。
    这篇文章为着表明十月革命对于全世界革命运动发展的影响，指出了四个基本问题，我们可以把自己过去的（最近的过去）看法逐条检讨：
    （一）十月革命冲破了世界帝国主义资产阶级的战线，而顺利地建立和巩固了一个社会主义无产阶级的政权，剥夺了地主资本家的生产工具和资料，使变成社会公有财产。这就具体地击破“被剥削者非有剥削者不行，正如头脑和其他肢体非有胃部不行一样”的“旧理论”。我们过去虽相信将来是社会主义的世界，但总当它是理想世界，并不正面地重视苏联十月革命后所建立和巩固的新政权，不能真正地认识它就是这种理想世界的具体表现。因之对于那种已受“致命的打击”的“骗人的”旧理论总在徬徨迷惑中。现在我们有了自己的新政权，对于十月革命的科学真理更加证实，不能再没有坚定的信心了。
    十月革命和以前所有的革命究竟有什么根本不同呢？“它的目的并不是以一种剥削形式代替另一种剥削形式，用一个剥削者集团代替另一个剥削者集团，而是要消灭任何人剥削人的现象，消灭所有一切剥削者集团，建立无产阶级专政。……”我们现在既也建立了自己的新政权，就得巩固起来，特别要警惕：世界帝国主义资产阶级在远东的战线被“冲破”了，它们是决不甘心的；因此，我们对于“镇压反革命”应该毫无疑义。新政权自身的任务，首先就在逐步“消灭任何人剥削人的现象”，我们对于“土地改革”就应该毫无疑义。
    （二）十月革命打击了帝国主义后方和外藩，震撼了帝国主义在各殖民地和依赖国里的统治；先自己“以身作则”地在国内“实行了民族殖民地革命”，苏联“不是为着民族主义，而是为着国际主义”，“无产阶级除非同时解放被压迫民族，就不能解放自己”，所以先使国内各民族得到真正的自由和平等，互相信任和亲近，这就大大地影响全世界殖民地和依赖国里被压迫民族革命运动的发展，截止了帝国主义“安然剥削和安然压迫殖民地依赖国的纪元”。过去一般中国人对于苏联一连串事实问题的误解和怀疑，只要读破此条，应该从根本上“涣然冰释”。
    在这里，我们还可以就目前国际形势讨论一个问题，就是对于“社会主义国家制度和资本主义国家制度的和平共存”应当有个明确的具体的理解。十月革命既然“开辟了一个新时代，即世界各被压迫国家中与无产阶级联盟并在无产阶级领导下所进行的殖民地革命底时代。”这个时代延展到现在，资本主义国家所倚靠的殖民地，其革命斗争更加尖锐化了；在目前国际形势下，两种制度要怎样才有“和平共存”的可能呢？去年十一月在维也纳开的“世界和平理事会第二届会议”，在八项政治性的决议中，就有五项是解决这种症结的“区域问题”，议决了两项原则，就是“民族自决”和“撤退外国军队”，并主张“以和平谈判的方式来解决”。我们学习斯大林的“十月革命的国际性质”，读到这一条，似乎可以把这个国际纠纷最多而又关系世界革命原则性的问题，结合有关文件作个讨论，同时对于两种制度在什么条件下才可能“和平共存”，可以获得较明确而具体的理解。
    （三）十月革命使整个世界资本主义存在本身都发生了问题，因为资本主义发展不平衡而发生第一次世界大战——帝国主义大屠杀，资本主义的发展，已由最高峰转入下坡路，走上腐朽和衰亡的过程，正当此时，一个大国把脱离资本主义世界体系的事实具体表现出来，就加速了这个过程；同时一方面给世界反对帝国主义的革命运动建立了一个强大的公开的中心基础，使全世界无产阶级和被压迫民族围绕着这个中心团结起来，组成革命统一战线来反对帝国主义，所以，整个世界资本主义——帝国主义的基础从此根本动摇，不再能“安宁”和“稳固”，“补缀”无效，“比重”渐轻。十月革命实在是开了资本主义灭亡的新纪元。我们学习过列宁的“帝国主义论”（帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段）的，对于这条应当能有深入而翔实的理解。但从一九五○年八月抗美援朝运动展开的时候起，一般人对于美国仍存在着错误的认识，那些因有亲美、崇美、恐美的思想而不愿“仇视”的现虽减少，但对“蔑视”和“鄙视”总还有些怀疑，还没有认清它已在走下坡路。再往前回忆抗日战争胜利时，我们对于美国的认识更完全错误，对于战后国际政治中两个基本方向形成的两大基本阵营的了解太不够，其实这两个阵营在这篇文章的第三条中已经分析得很清楚。这篇文章是早在一九二七年发表的，我们至迟在抗日战争时期（一九三七年以后）也曾看到的，当时竟漠然无动于中，以致到了抗日战争胜利时，竟如毛主席所说，“对于第二次世界大战的胜利的意义估计不足，将是一个极大的错误。”（见“全世界革命力量团结起来反对帝国主义侵略”）我们处在三十年来中国革命的过程中，就因为不了解这两大基本阵营的根本性质和对于我们的关系，不决定自己应站的立场，以致模糊了敌我的区别，早就犯了“极大的错误”；到抗日胜利时，错误的看法更加严重。直到解放后，抗美援朝运动展开，才从学习中渐次觉醒过来，今读此文，更该猛省。
    （四）这一点更重要，即：马克思主义战胜了改良主义。这“又是‘智慧’中的革命”，在当时的苏联，则是工人阶级思想中的革命。一般改良主义者也可以打着马克思主义的旗帜，但对于反动阶级并不进行革命斗争，丝毫不肯设法促进无产阶级专政思想的实现。像当时的社会民主党，表面上可“与马克思主义混合着”，但对于马克思主义的阶级敌人
    “是没有任何危险的”。等到十月革命一声炮响，无产阶级专政胜利了，他们的面前就隔着一道“深渊”，而且逐渐地跑入敌人的阵营，做了反动派的
    “思想支柱”。所以列宁当时骂社会民主党“政治家”，是“资产阶级在工人运动中的真正走狗，是资本家阶级在工人中间的代办”；“在无产阶级反资产阶级的国内战争中”，他们是必然会站在“凡尔赛派方面反对巴黎公社社员”的。
    三十年来领导中国革命的中国共产党，建立在苏联十月革命以后，一开始就照着列宁的原则，直到现在，思想上和组织上都没有受到欧洲社会民主党第二国际的影响，也没有经过欧洲那样的资本主义和工人阶级在议会里和平斗争的时期，也没有欧洲那样的工人贵族阶级（据刘少奇同志一九四一年论党内斗争）。到了全国基本解放，革命胜利，反动政权被打垮的时候，社会上却留下一批站在反动阶级立场的知识分子——改良主义者。当我们没有精读这篇文章时，还不能感觉到自己正是斯大林同志所说的这第四点里头一路的人，虽然情况跟苏联的社会民主党之类不尽相同。列宁也说过：“一般改良主义底实质，就是只去鼓动实行那些不必消灭旧有统治阶级主要基础的变更，可与保存这些基础相容的变更。”（见列宁的“几个争论问题”）像我自以为三十多年来专心搞“中国文字改革运动”的，对于社会发展总起了些一定的进步作用，撇开了政治的立场而把“革命”和“改良”孤立地用在技术上和社会运动方式计划上；经过学习，才确认自己在历年的北洋军阀和国民党反动统治下，居然能够“和平相处”地进行文字改革运动，真是从头至尾不折不扣的“改良主义者”：明知这种“变更”是不成功的，那就是“失败主义”；假如这种
    “变更”果然成了功，那就更是进一步的“帮凶”。特别是在北京师范大学任教任职也继续了三十多年，在九三学社组织活动以前，可以说，完全是替反动统治阶级服务，对于青年们起了很多的坏作用、恶影响，这是连“改良主义”都说不上的。现在我们应当深切地认识：中国的解放，就是马克思主义战胜了改良主义，这不仅是经济关系和社会政治关系方面的革命，同时也是“智慧”中的革命。
    为什么中国革命在“十月革命”以后就变成了新民主主义的革命？因为“十月革命的胜利是人类史中的根本转变，……是全世界被剥削群众底斗争方法和组织形式、生活方式和传统、文化和思想体系中的根本转变。”而“中国革命是世界革命的一部分”，新民主主义的革命就是根据马列主义的科学真理，顺着全世界的这个根本转变而又适合中国国情的。
    我们过去对于十月革命的性质认识模糊，因之三十多年来对于苏联和中国革命的正确方向认识也模糊，不了解或者不确信改造客观世界的科学真理，处在这三十多年的革命过程中，竟不分清敌、我、友，堕入改良主义，站到反动的阶级立场而不自知。现在惟有从头学习，彻底检讨，认清昔日之“我”就是今日之“敌”！
