    Many Redundant and Wasteful Phenomena in Publications of Governments and Organs at All Levels

    Comrade Editor: Currently, there are many internal publications issued by governments and organs at all levels (estimated to be about five or six hundred or more). Many publications reprint each other's content, resulting in redundancy and reflecting blindness in publishing work.

    According to inspections, the content of general "Government Gazettes" mostly consists of reprinted articles, often accounting for more than 50 percent. For example, the "Government Gazette" and "Administrative Gazette" published by the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government had 126 identical articles within nine months. In Fujian, the "Government Gazette" had an average of over 74 percent reprinted material per issue within eight months. Jiangxi Province printed a "Compilation" of the People's Representative Conference from all walks of life, which contained more than 20 pages of photos and made more than 800 inches of copper plates, which is also a significant waste. I believe that the publications issued by governments and organs at all levels are in great need of a unified regulation and appropriate reorganization. Publish what should be published, and discontinue what should not.

    In the anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign, I hope this matter will attract the attention of people's governments and organs at all levels.
                                                                                                    Liu Deling

    各级政府、机关出版的刊物有许多重复浪费现象
    编辑同志：目前各级政府、机关出版的内部刊物很多（估计约五、六百种以上）。许多刊物互相转载，内容重复，表现了出版工作的盲目性。
    据检查，一般“政报”的内容，转载的篇幅多占百分之五十以上。如同属平原省人民政府出版的“政报”和“行政公报”，在九个月内，就有一百二十六篇稿子是一样的。福建的“政报”，在八个月内，平均每期有百分之七十四以上是转载的材料。江西省印一本各界人民代表会议的“汇刊”，刊载了二十多页照片，制了八百多吋铜版，这也是一种很大的浪费。我认为，各级政府、机关出版的刊物，很需要一个统一规定，并加以适当整理。该出的出，不该出的停刊。
    在反贪污反浪费运动中，我希望这件事能引起各级人民政府和机关的注意。    刘德龄
