Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd: According to TASS, for the average American, 1951 was a year of further intensifying the struggle for peace and against war, a year of growing peace ranks, and a year of consolidating the peace movement in the United States. In June 1951, the National Peace Conference was held in Chicago, where it adopted a program for the struggle for peace in the United States and established a national committee to lead the peace movement; central organizations of the peace movement such as the "American Peace Crusade" and the "American Youth Peace Crusade" were established; organizing committees of peace advocates were established in almost every state—all of which proved that the scope of the American peace movement had expanded.

One characteristic of the American peace movement in 1951 that distinguished it from the past was that not only workers from progressive independent unions, but also workers from AFL and CIO unions, actively participated in and led the organized struggle for peace. The magazine "Labor's Advance" wrote: "We are pleased that workers are beginning to take the lead on the issue of peace." The magazine pointed out that some large unions have recently openly expressed their active participation in the struggle against war. Some progressive leaders of AFL and CIO unions called on the ranks of the American proletariat to unite and fight for peace. Max O'Na, the assistant editor of the "Colorado Labor Advocate" (the organ of the Colorado AFL-CIO), in his open letter to members of national unions, called for a national labor peace conference. This call received widespread support among the leading bodies of progressive unions. In some large cities, leaders of progressive unions and progressive leaders of AFL and CIO unions have respectively established preparatory committees for "Labor Peace Conferences." Although the reactionary heads of AFL and CIO unions have tried their best to oppose it, ordinary members and progressive union workers are increasingly intensifying their struggle to establish a united front of workers for peace in the United States.

The peace movement among American farmers and agricultural workers is also growing. The Eastern States divisions of the National Farmers Union passed the following peace program at its annual meeting: withdraw American troops from Korea, admit the People's Republic of China to the United Nations, return Taiwan to China, eliminate international tensions, and establish genuine democracy in political, social, and economic aspects.

The American struggle for peace and to prevent another world war is particularly related to the struggle to stop the Korean War. The American people's desire to end military operations in Korea as soon as possible is reflected in the resolution of the Chicago National Peace Conference calling for "complete peace in Korea." Peace conferences held in various places and many letters from the people to members of Congress, the State Department, and President Truman have made this demand. The grand peace demonstration held in New York said in a resolution to Truman: "Not another person must die. We demand an immediate armistice agreement in Korea." A reader in a certain city in Oregon wrote to the "Oregon Daily Journal": "The so-called inevitability of war is an insult to all people. The people of the world want peace and demand peace. ... Please demand an end to the Korean War and withdraw American troops back to their country, and don't let them be sent abroad as aggressors anymore." Some influential social figures in Chicago wrote to the State Department: "Negotiations must not be allowed to be interrupted..."

American laborers closely link the struggle for peace with the struggle for good living conditions and a bright future for their children. The New York City Committee of the "National Labor Peace Conference" wrote in its appeal for a national labor peace conference: "The impact of the war economy on the living standards of ordinary Americans is becoming increasingly clear. Although billions of dollars have been consumed by military orders, unemployment has become a common phenomenon in many industrial sectors across the country. People in employment are faced with endless wage freezes, and wages are increasingly unable to keep up with the ever-rising cost of living. The ever-increasing tax burden is weighing on the shoulders of workers, who are the least able to afford it among the residents. But at the same time, large corporations and monopolies are reporting unprecedentedly huge profits, and they enjoy privileges in terms of taxation. The American people are increasingly convinced that the policy of expanding armaments and launching war adventures pursued by the American ruling group will further reduce their living standards and eliminate basic freedoms."

A member of a local union said: "The war economy can never eliminate unemployment and the sweatshop system. ... Only peace can maintain our living standards. For Americans, peace is bread and butter."

The American people know that the most solid and reliable foundation for guaranteeing peace in the world is to resolve the differences between the five major powers and conclude a five-power peace pact. The "American Peace Crusade" has launched a campaign to collect one million signatures nationwide for a declaration for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact.

The work of collecting signatures for the appeal for holding a five-power conference, as the leader of the American Progressive Party said, is the first step of the American Progressive Party in the election campaign. A recent Gallup poll showed that 70 percent of Americans surveyed supported the idea of holding a five-power conference.

The past year has proved that the American peace movement is a force that the American ruling group cannot ignore.

    一年来美国和平运动范围日渐扩大
    进步工会工作者争取建立工人争取和平的统一战线大多数美国人民要求停止侵朝战争举行五大国会议
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：一九五一年对于美国普通人说来，是进一步加紧争取和平反对战争的一年，是和平队伍壮大的一年，是和平运动在美国巩固的一年。一九五一年六月，全国和平大会在芝加哥举行，会上通过了在美国争取和平的斗争的纲领，成立了领导和平运动的全国委员会；像“美国和平十字军”、“美国青年和平十字军”这样的和平运动中央组织成立起来了；几乎在各州都成立了和平拥护者的组织委员会——所有这一切，都证明美国和平运动的范围扩大了。
    一九五一年美国和平运动与过去不同的一个特色，是积极参加有组织的争取和平的斗争和积极领导这一斗争的，不仅有进步的独立工会的工人，而且也有劳联、产联工会的工人。“劳工进军”杂志写道：“我们高兴的是：工人开始在和平的问题上起带头作用了。”这个杂志指出，最近有一些大工会公开表示积极参加反对战争的斗争。劳联、产联所属工会的一些进步领袖号召美国无产阶级的队伍团结起来，为和平而斗争。“科罗拉多劳工呼声报”
    （科罗拉多州劳联工会机关报）的副主编麦克斯·奥纳在他致全国工会会员的公开信中呼吁召开全国劳工和平大会。这个呼吁在进步工会领导机关中间得到了广泛的支持。在一些大城市，进步工会的领袖以及劳联、产联工会的进步领袖分别成立了“劳工和平会议”筹备委员会。虽然劳联、产联工会的反动头子竭力予以反对，可是普通会员和进步工会工作者正日益加紧为在美国建立工人争取和平的统一战线而进行斗争。
    美国农场主和农业工人中间的和平运动也日见壮大。全国农民联盟东部各州的分会在年会上通过下列和平纲领：把美国军队撤出朝鲜，接纳中华人民共和国出席联合国，把台湾归还中国，消除国际紧张局势，在政治、社会与经济各方面建立真正的民主。
    美国争取和平、防止另一次世界战争的斗争，特别与制止朝鲜战争的斗争有关联。美国人民要求尽速停止在朝鲜的军事行动的愿望，表现在芝加哥全国和平大会要求“在朝鲜建立完全的和平”这一决议中。各地举行的和平会议以及人民致国会议员、国务院与杜鲁门总统的许多信件都提出了这种要求。在纽约举行的盛大的和平示威大会在致杜鲁门的决议中说：“决不可再死一个人。我们要求立即缔结朝鲜停战协定。”俄勒冈某城一个读者致函“俄勒冈日报”说：“所谓战争不可避免的说法，对所有的人都是一种侮辱。世界各国人民都希望和平，要求和平。……请你们要求停止朝鲜战争，把美国军队撤回本国吧，不要再让人把他们派到国外当侵略者了。”芝加哥一些有势力的社会名流致函国务院说：“决不能容许谈判中断……”
    美国劳动者把争取和平的斗争和争取良好的生活条件、争取自己孩子的光明前途的斗争密切地联系在一起。“全国劳工和平会议”纽约市委员会在要求召开全国劳工和平大会的呼吁书中写道：“战争经济对美国一般人生活水平的影响越来越显明了。虽然因军事订货消耗了数以十亿计的美元，然而失业已成了全国各地许多工业部门的普遍现象。在职的人们碰到漫无尽期的工资冻结，工资越来越无法赶上一直上升的最低生活费。日益增加的赋税负担压在工人的肩头上，而工人却是居民中最出不起钱的一部分。但同时，大公司和垄断公司则报告着它们获得空前庞大利润的情形，它们在纳税方面享有特权。美国人民愈益相信，美国统治集团执行的扩张军备和发动战争冒险的政策，将使他们的生活水平进一步降低，将使基本自由荡然无存。”
    有一个地方工会的会员说：“战争经济永远不能消灭失业和血汗制。……只有和平才能维持我们的生活水平。对于美国人，和平就是面包和牛油。”
    美国人民知道，保证全世界和平的最牢固和最可靠的基础是解决五大国的分歧和缔结五大国和平公约。“美国和平十字军”发动的为缔结五大国和平公约宣言征集一百万签名的运动已在全国各地展开。
    为要求举行五大国会议的呼吁书征集签名的工作，如美国进步党的领袖所说，是美国进步党在竞选运动中的第一个步骤。最近举行的盖洛普民意测验表明：被征询过意见的美国人中有百分之七十支持召开五大国会议的意见。
    过去的一年证明：美国的和平运动已是美国统治集团不能忽视的力量了。
