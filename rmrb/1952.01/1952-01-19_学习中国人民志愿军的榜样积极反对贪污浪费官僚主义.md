    Learn from the Example of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and Actively Oppose Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy
    Editor: The call made by the CCP Committee of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on January 12th to the entire army to practice strict economy and oppose waste is a great encouragement to the people living peacefully in the motherland.
    Everyone knows that the Volunteer Army is in a very difficult situation on the Korean front. But even in such a difficult environment, they are still carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy together with the people of the motherland. Therefore, I think each of us should ask ourselves: What is our attitude towards this great movement? Are we worthy of our most beloved people?
    In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, some people think that this movement is "irrelevant" to them. Therefore, they adopt a liberal attitude towards the movement and turn a blind eye to the "rats" who steal state property. Most of these people have an excuse: "A little waste doesn't matter" or "Corruption doesn't concern me," not knowing that this kind of excuse is a medium for accepting bourgeois ideology! They should immediately see that even in the environment of "a mouthful of fried noodles and a mouthful of snow," the Volunteer Army believes that "increasing production and practicing strict economy" is related to them, and they have enthusiastically launched the economy movement. They must wake up in this movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, strictly examine themselves ideologically and in their daily lives, criticize the idea of ​​disregarding national wealth, and establish a style of hard work and simplicity. Otherwise, anyone who fails to overcome the above-mentioned wrong ideas in this movement will embark on the path of degeneration and become an enemy of the people!
    I hope that every patriotic person will learn from our most beloved people and more actively rise up and wage an irreconcilable struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, so as to further complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy as our gift to the most beloved people in 1952!

    学习中国人民志愿军的榜样积极反对贪污浪费官僚主义
    编辑同志：一月十二日人民日报登载了中共中国人民志愿军党委对全军提出的厉行节约、反对浪费的号召。这一伟大的号召，对于在祖国过着和平生活的人们，应该是一个莫大的鼓舞。
    大家都知道，志愿军在朝鲜前线是十分艰苦的。但就在这样艰苦的环境下，他们还同祖国人民一道开展增产节约的运动。因此，我认为我们每个人都应该扪心自问：自己对这一伟大运动所采取的是什么态度？自己是否对得起我们的最可爱的人？
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动中，有的人认为这个运动和自己“无关”，因之，就对运动采取自由主义的态度，对盗窃国家财产的“老鼠”熟视无睹。这些人，大都有一种借口：“浪费点不算什么”、“贪污与我不沾”，而不知这种借口就是接受资产阶级思想的媒介！他们应该马上看一看，志愿军在那种“一口炒面一口雪”的环境下，都认为“增加生产，厉行节约”与自己有关，热烈展开了节约运动。他们必须在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动中猛醒过来，从思想上生活上严格检查自己，批判漠视国家财富的思想，树立坚苦朴素的作风。否则，谁如果不在这个运动中克服上面所说的错误思想，谁就会走上堕落的道路，成为人民的敌人！
    希望每一个爱国的人民，都向我们最可爱的人看齐，更积极地起来和贪污、浪费、官僚主义作不调和的斗争，以进一步完成增产节约的任务，来作为我们一九五二年对最可爱的人的献礼！
