Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 4th: Our front-line reporter reports: In the six days from December 25th to 30th, 1951, the American aggressor troops and their accomplice forces expanded their incursion force and the number of attacks in many places. The fighting was much more intense than in the past twenty-odd days. However, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army resolutely struck the invading enemy everywhere, causing the enemy to suffer more and more casualties under our heroic resistance and counterattacks.

	On the Eastern Front, our army engaged in fierce mountain battles with the invading enemy for four days from the 25th to the 28th. On the 25th, a unit of our army recovered a high ground west of Mundung-ri in a single counterattack, annihilating an entire platoon and most of two platoons of the defending enemy, the puppet Rhee army's 7th Division. On the morning of the 26th, the enemy launched a frantic counterattack on the area with a force of one to two companies. Our few defending troops fought this enemy force for seven hours, inflicting heavy casualties before withdrawing from the position. However, two hours later, our army regained the position with an irresistible counterattack, and the remaining enemy fled in panic. On the morning of the 27th, an enemy company continued to frantically attack the high ground, but successive charges were repelled by our fierce firepower. In the afternoon, the enemy increased to a battalion and launched five fierce attacks, but were still repelled. At dusk, the enemy was forced to retreat due to heavy casualties. That afternoon, another unit of our army in the area recovered another high ground with swift and courageous action. On the 28th, the enemy continued to attack the two high grounds, regardless of heavy losses. Our army killed and wounded more than 100 enemy soldiers before temporarily withdrawing from the two high grounds. In these four days of fierce fighting, our army annihilated more than 600 enemy soldiers on these two high grounds.

	On the Western Front, our army also severely damaged the invading enemy with a strong defensive battle, inflicting heavy casualties at a small cost. On the 29th, an enemy company attacked the Chengsan area west of Tieyuan and was repelled by our dense artillery fire, with more than 50 enemy soldiers killed. North of Changdan, an enemy battalion, under the cover of seven tanks, eight aircraft, and several artillery groups, launched a frantic counterattack on our army's position on North Mountain of Chiryeong-dong, encountering strong resistance from our army. After suffering more than 100 casualties, they retreated south. On the morning of the 30th, the enemy again attacked a certain high ground with a battalion of troops under the cover of seven tanks and several artillery groups, and successive charges were repelled six times. This enemy force was also subjected to fierce bombardment by our artillery fire during its retreat. On this day, our army killed and wounded a total of more than 440 enemy soldiers. On the same morning, an enemy company attacked Guangdae west of Tieyuan four times, but was repelled by a unit of our army, with more than 40 enemy soldiers killed and wounded, and no casualties on our side.

	In the central region, our army has repeatedly repelled attacks by small groups of enemy troops in recent days.

	On the west coast, our coastal defense forces crossed the sea on the 26th to counterattack Great Sleeping Duck Island and Small Sleeping Duck Island, completely annihilating more than 100 defending enemies, and seizing 170 rifles and 4 machine guns.

    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】本社前线记者报道：在一九五一年十二月二十五日到三十日的六天中，美国侵略军和它的帮凶军在许多地方扩大了进犯的兵力和攻击的次数，战斗比过去的二十多天激烈得多了。但朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军无论在那个地方都予犯敌以坚决的打击，使敌军在我英勇的阻击和反击下遭到愈来愈多的伤亡。
    在东线，我军在二十五日到二十八日的四天中，和犯敌进行了激烈的山地争夺战。二十五日，我军某部在反击战中一举收复文登里以西的一个高地，歼灭守敌李伪军第七师的一个整排及两个排的大部。二十六日晨，敌军用一个连到两个连的兵力，向该地疯狂反扑。我少数守军和这股敌军打了七个小时，杀伤大量敌军后撤离了这个阵地。但在两小时后，我军又以不可阻挡的反击夺回了这个阵地，残敌仓皇逃窜。二十七日上午，敌军一个连继续向该高地疯狂进攻，但连续三次的冲锋都被我炽烈的火力所击退。下午，敌军增至一个营，猛扑五次，但仍然都被击退。黄昏，敌军因为伤亡惨重，被迫后撤。那天下午，该地我军另部以迅速而勇猛的动作夺回另一个高地。二十八日，不顾惨重损失的敌军继续向那两个高地进攻。我军又毙伤敌一百多人后，暂时撤出这两个高地。在这四天的激战中，我军在这两个高地上一共歼灭了敌军六百多人。
    在西线，我军也以坚强的阻击战痛击进犯的敌军，以微小的代价杀伤大量敌军。二十九日，敌军一个连向铁原以西城山地区进攻，被我密集炮火击退，敌军被击毙五十多人。在长湍以北，敌军一个营在七辆战车、八架飞机和几个炮群的掩护下，向智陵洞北山我军阵地疯狂反扑，遭到我军坚强的阻击，伤亡一百多人后向南退去。三十日上午，敌又以一个营兵力在战车七辆及数个炮群的掩护下，向某高地进犯，连续冲锋六次都被击退。这股敌军在退却时又遭到我炮火的猛烈轰击。这天，我军共毙伤敌军四百四十多人。同日上午，敌军一个连向铁原以西的光大岱进攻四次，都被我军某部击退，敌军伤亡四十多人，我军无一伤亡。
    在中线地区，我军连日击退小股敌军的进攻。
    在西海岸，我海防部队在二十六日渡海反击大睡鸭岛、小睡鸭岛，全歼守敌百余人，缴获步枪一百七十枝、机枪四挺。
