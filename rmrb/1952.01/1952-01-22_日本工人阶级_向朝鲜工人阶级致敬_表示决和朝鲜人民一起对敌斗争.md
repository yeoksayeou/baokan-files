Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 21st. The Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions recently received letters of tribute from Watanabe Michio, alternate member of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council and representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions Japan Liaison Office, and the All-Japan Metalworkers' Union.

Watanabe Michio, on behalf of the Japanese working class, extended warm greetings to the heroic Korean working class and all the people. He wrote in his letter: Japan has become a colony due to the indefinite occupation by American imperialism. The American aggressors are reviving Japanese militarism, attempting to drive the Japanese people as cannon fodder for aggression. They are laying off workers in large numbers, oppressing working people into forced labor. Prices are soaring, but wages are decreasing. Electricity and coal are mostly used for military production, and peaceful industries and small and medium-sized enterprises are closing down one after another. We workers oppose this enslavement and exploitation by the aggressors. Two and a half million organized workers have gone on strike or slowdowns demanding wage increases and opposing layoffs. At the same time, we have also bravely launched a struggle against the separate peace treaty with Japan and the US-Japan "Security Treaty." The demands for a ceasefire in Korea, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and support for the Korean people's call are also growing louder. Watanabe Michio concluded by saying: We, the Japanese working class, regardless of all suppression, are determined to fight alongside the Korean people against the enemy until final victory. We believe that our struggle for peace, liberation, and happiness is linked to the struggle of the working class and people of all of Asia and the world. As long as we unite as one, we can achieve victory.

The All-Japan Metalworkers' Union, in its letter, represented 1.2 million metalworkers across Japan in extending greetings to the Korean working class and expressed its determination to further strengthen the friendship and unity between the workers of Japan and Korea, and to jointly strive to defend lasting peace in Asia and the world.

    表示决和朝鲜人民一起对敌斗争
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会最近接到世界工会联合会理事会候补理事、世界工联日本联络事务局代表渡边三知夫和全日本金属工人工会的致敬信。
    渡边三知夫代表日本工人阶级，向英勇抗战的朝鲜工人阶级和全体人民热烈致敬。他在信中写道：日本因美帝国主义无限期的占领而变为殖民地。美国侵略者正使日本军国主义复活，妄图驱使日本人民作为侵略炮灰。他们大批解雇工人，压迫劳动人民作苦役似的劳动。物价高涨，但工资却在减少。电力和煤大都用于军需生产，和平产业及中小企业纷纷倒闭。我们工人都反对侵略者这种奴役和剥削。二百五十万有组织的工人要求增加工资和反对解雇，进行了罢工或怠工斗争。同时，我们还英勇地展开了反对单独对日和约和美日“安全条约”的斗争。要求朝鲜停战，从朝鲜撤退外国军队，支持朝鲜人民的呼声，也日益响亮。渡边三知夫最后说：我们日本工人阶级不顾一切镇压，一定要和朝鲜人民一起和敌人斗争到取得最后胜利时为止。我们相信：我们争取和平、解放和幸福的斗争，是和全亚洲全世界的工人阶级和人民的斗争联系在一起的。只要团结一致，就能取得胜利。
    全日本金属工人工会在信中代表全日本一百二十万金属工人，向朝鲜工人阶级致敬，并表示要进一步加强日、朝两国工人的友谊团结，共同为保卫亚洲和世界的持久和平而奋斗。
