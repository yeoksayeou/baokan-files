Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 7th dispatch: New Year's Day 1952 on the Kaesong front was filled with festive joy. Many bunker entrances were decorated with colorful arches made of pine branches, flanked by various New Year couplets such as "Celebrate the victory of 1951 and strive for the glory of 1952." When the New Year's comfort delegation from the leadership of a certain unit arrived at the Dadeshan frontline with Commander Peng Dehuai's New Year's congratulatory letter, the congratulatory letter and commendation letter from the unit's leaders, and a large number of comfort items, the soldiers were extremely happy. The soldiers of the "Tieyuan Special Merit Company," who had made outstanding achievements in the New Year's battles, happily reported their victorious deeds to the comfort delegation, and expressed their determination to strive for greater victories in 1952 to thank their superiors for their concern. Commander Peng's letter spread quickly through the trenches. Every soldier deeply realized from their own experience the invincible strength of our army, which grows stronger with each battle, and everyone was filled with unparalleled confidence in achieving greater victories this year. In the Tieyuan blocking battle last year, the company eliminated more than 700 American soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division and was collectively awarded a special merit; more than 20 individuals were commended. In the battles before the New Year, the company eliminated another 630 enemies, for a total of 1,330 enemies eliminated throughout the year. They plan to eliminate more enemies in this year's battles, and the entire company will strive for another special merit. Squad leader Miao Shikuan, who had been awarded two major merits, said: "If the enemy wants to continue fighting this year, I will definitely strive for a special merit in battle."

　　The volunteer soldiers on the Dadeshan front had wiped out more than 800 enemies in three days not long ago, and they presented this victory as a New Year's gift to Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland. After receiving Commander Peng's New Year's letter, their confidence in victory soared a hundredfold. On January 3, after two days of preparation, the Li Chengwan troops assembled a regiment-sized force, supported by aircraft, artillery, and tanks, and launched an attack on the Dadeshan position. The soldiers defending the position repelled the enemy's repeated attacks, killing and wounding more than 600 enemy soldiers and destroying and damaging three enemy tanks in one day. During the battle, the soldiers put forward the resounding slogan: "Fight the first battle well in 1952!" "We are the glorious fighting team against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and we must strive for greater glory in 1952!" Deputy Platoon Leader Wu Xiushan continued to direct the battle after one arm was injured, and threw grenades with his other arm. Communist Party member Lai Jiaqin held more than 30 grenades and threw them continuously at the enemy. He was wounded in two places but refused to leave the front line, and finally gave his life. Under the brave warriors' strong blows, the invading enemy retreated in defeat.

　　At the position of the Third Artillery of a certain artillery unit, piles of artillery shells, polished to a brilliant shine, were stacked. The gunners sat at their gun positions, ready to bombard the enemy at any time. On the wall of the artillery position hung a wooden plaque recording the glorious achievements of this gun in 1951. In the blocking battle under Yueyue Mountain in Tieyuan, this gun fired fifteen shells, killing and wounding more than 300 American soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division and destroying eleven enemy vehicles transporting ammunition. Therefore, the gunners specially wrote a doggerel for this gun: "Made merit under Yueyue Mountain, defending Kaesong is even more glorious; Aim accurately and fire fiercely, the enemy's tricks are all in vain; Fight a victorious battle to repay the motherland, add glory in the year of fifty-two."

　　In the various bunkers on the front line, the soldiers held small New Year's celebration meetings. The tables were filled with cigarettes, candies, and comfort bags sent by the people of the motherland. The soldiers used quick-board dramas they wrote themselves, singing of the great victory of 1951 and their determination to kill the enemy and perform meritorious deeds in 1952. They kept in mind Commander Peng's words in his New Year's congratulatory letter: "Continue to annihilate the enemies who dare to continue invading, and strive for the final victory in the anti-aggression war."

    开城前线志愿军战士欢度新年
    战士们对争取今年更大的胜利充满无限信心
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】一九五二年新年，在开城前线的阵地上，到处充满了节日的欢乐。许多掩蔽部的洞口上，有着用松枝扎成的彩门，两旁挂着“庆祝一九五一年的胜利，争取一九五二年的光荣”等各式的新年对联。当某部领导机关的新年慰问团带着彭德怀司令员元旦的贺年信，和该部首长的贺年庆功信，以及大批慰劳品来到大德山一线阵地上时，战士们高兴极了。在新年战斗中功绩卓著的“铁原特功连”的战士们，愉快地向慰问团报告了他们的胜利事迹，并纷纷表示要在一九五二年中争取更大的胜利，来答谢上级首长对他们的关怀。彭司令员的信在战壕里迅速地传开了。每一个战士都从自己的经历中深深体会到我军愈战愈强的无敌力量，每个人对争取今年更大的胜利充满无比的信心。该连在去年铁原阻击战中，曾消灭了美军骑一师七百多人，全连集体立了特等功，个人立功的有二十多人。在年前的战斗中，该连又消灭敌人六百三十人，全年共消灭敌人一千三百三十人。他们计划在今年的战斗中要消灭更多的敌人，全连争取再立一个特等功。曾经立过两次大功的班长苗时宽说：“今年敌人如果还要打下去，我一定争取在战斗中立个特等功。”
    大德山阵地上的志愿军战士们曾在不久前的三天中共歼敌八百多人，并拿这个胜利作为向毛主席和祖国人民拜年的礼物。他们在接到彭司令员的贺年信后，胜利信心更加百倍高涨。一月三日，李伪军在经过两天准备后，又凑了一个团的兵力，配合着飞机、大炮、战车向大德山阵地发动进攻。守卫在阵地上的战士们击退了敌人的轮番攻击，在一天中又毙伤敌军六百多人，击毁击伤敌人战车三辆。在战斗中，战士们提出了响亮的口号：“打好一九五二年第一仗！”“我们是抗美援朝光荣的战斗队，要在一九五二年争取更大的光荣！”副排长吴秀山一只胳膊被打伤了，他仍继续指挥作战，并用另一只胳膊投手榴弹。共产党员赖家勤抱着三十多个手榴弹，连续地投向敌人，他身上两处负伤仍不下火线，最后献出了自己的生命。在勇士们坚强的锤击下，进犯敌军溃退下去了。
    在某炮兵部队第三炮的阵地上，堆满了一发发擦得雪亮的炮弹。炮手们坐在炮位上随时准备着轰击敌人。该炮阵地的墙上，挂着一个木牌，记录着这门炮在一九五一年中的光辉战绩。在铁原夜月山下的阻击战中，这门炮发出十五发炮弹，曾杀伤美军骑一师一个营的三百多人，并击毁敌人运输弹药的汽车十一辆。因此，炮手们特意给这门炮写了一首快板：“夜月山下立了功，保卫开城更光荣；瞄的准来打的猛，敌人诡计都落空；打个胜仗报祖国，五二年里增光荣。”
    在前沿的各个掩蔽部里，战士们都开了小型的庆祝新年座谈会。桌上摆着祖国人民送来的香烟、糖果和慰问袋。战士们用自己编写的快板剧，演唱着
    一九五一年的伟大胜利，和一九五二年杀敌立功的决心。他们牢记着彭司令员在元旦贺年信中的一句话：“不断地歼灭敢于继续侵犯的敌人，争取反侵略战争的最后胜利。”
