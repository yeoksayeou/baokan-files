　　Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: American imperialism is now actively supporting Kuomintang remnant bandits in activities along the Sino-Burmese border, threatening the security of our border. TASS, London: According to a report by Knox, the "Observer" correspondent in Rangoon, Americans are supporting the activities of Kuomintang bandits on the Sino-Burmese border. Chiang Kai-shek's elite battalion has recently been transferred from Taiwan to reinforce Li Mi's 93rd Division of the Kuomintang, which is based in Kentung Province, Burma. The division headquarters and about 4,000 of its soldiers are now stationed in Mong Sha, about 25 miles from the Thai border. Their airfield is now being expanded. Not far away, there are another 2,000 soldiers of the division stationed. In addition, about 3,000 people are stationed on the Yunnan border, and the same number are stationed along the east bank of the Salween River. Surrendered Kuomintang soldiers said they were helped into Burma by an American organization in Bangkok.
　　Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: TASS, London: The British-Soviet Friendship Society issued the following statement on January 21:
　　A Rangoon dispatch of January 20 stated: Chiang Kai-shek's troops are being transported from Taiwan to northern Burma in preparation for an attack on South China. This news clearly confirms the sharp warning issued on January 3 by Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. Vyshinsky urged everyone to pay attention to the fact that American ships were being used to transport Chiang Kai-shek's troops from Taiwan to Thailand and northern Burma to fight against China. This warning has received little attention in Britain. The British people—for whom war against China can only bring more sacrifices and disasters—should heed Vyshinsky's warning at the United Nations General Assembly, which has now been confirmed by direct news from Burma; this news says that a cruel conspiracy is underway to drag the Western world into a war against China.

    美帝国主义现正积极支持国民党残匪在中缅边界进行活动威胁我边境安全
    【新华社二十四日讯】美帝国主义现正积极支持国民党残匪，在中缅边界进行活动，威胁我国边境的安全。塔斯社伦敦消息：据英国“观察家报”驻仰光记者诺克士报道美国人支持中缅边界上的国民党匪徒的活动说：蒋介石的一营精锐部队最近已由台湾调去加强以缅甸的肯东省为基地的国民党李弥的第九十三师。该师师部和该师四千名左右的兵士现驻留在离泰国边境约二十五哩的蒙沙。他们的机场现在正在扩大。在不远的地方，驻有该师的另外两千名兵士。此外，大约有三千人驻在云南边界上，相同数目的人沿着萨尔温江东岸驻留着。投降的国民党兵士说，他们是受到曼谷美国组织的帮助进入缅甸的。
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：英苏友好协会在一月二十一日发表声明如下：
    一月二十日仰光消息说：蒋介石的军队正在从台湾被运到缅甸北部去，准备进攻华南。这一消息明显地证实了苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长维辛斯基在一月三日提出的尖锐警告。维辛斯基曾促请大家注意美国船只被用来从台湾运输蒋介石军队到泰国和缅甸北部去对中国作战。这个警告在英国几乎没有受到注意。英国人民——对中国作战，对他们说来只有带来更多的牺牲与灾祸——应该注意维辛斯基在联合国大会上的警告，现在这一警告已由直接来自缅甸的消息所证实；这个消息说，把西方世界卷入对中国战争中的残忍阴谋正在进行之中。
