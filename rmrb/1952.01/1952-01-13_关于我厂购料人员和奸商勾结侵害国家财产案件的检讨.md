    A Review of the Case of Collusion Between Purchasing Personnel and Unscrupulous Merchants in Our Factory, Infringing on State Property
    Cui Baotang, Director of Wuchang Material Factory, Hengyang Railway Bureau
    Since 1949, our factory has been purchasing railway equipment in Wuhan. Because I have a serious bureaucratic style of work and do not pay attention to the procurement work, nor do I deeply understand the ideological situation of the staff, the embezzlement cases of white alloy, paint, etc., were not discovered until October 1950. The review is as follows:
    First, in the past, when purchasing materials, the purchasing department would first open bids and compare prices within the factory. The merchants would copy the various materials listed in the bids and return the next day with quotations. Our factory would then compare the prices quoted by the merchants, and sometimes we would blindly reduce prices. This method not only gave unscrupulous merchants the opportunity to collude, but also allowed them to raise prices drastically, anticipating our price reductions. I failed to analyze and study this unreasonable way of working at the time and allowed it to develop.
    Second, on December 25, 1949, the Wuhan Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce published an announcement in the Yangtze River Daily stating "that agencies and troops must go through the Administration for Industry and Commerce for processing or ordering goods in private factories in this city," but I did not pay attention to this announcement.
    Third, the acceptance of materials is an important task. However, in the past, every time a large batch of materials was accepted, I simply relied on the acceptance personnel. I did not realize that the acceptance of materials was an important task of the materials factory.
    Fourth, the former inspector of our factory, Wang Huian, was originally an apprentice in the hardware industry in Hankou. Before liberation, although he had participated in railway work, he often colluded with merchants. After the liberation of Wuhan, Wang pretended to be active. I did not detect these situations in time and still assigned him to the acceptance work, resulting in the white alloy embezzlement case.
    Fifth, in response to the above shortcomings, I have proposed and partially implemented the following improvements:
    1.  When purchasing materials, it is necessary to go through the industrial and commercial administration authorities and carefully study the quality; if it is necessary to test, it must be tested first, and then its cost and price must be calculated.
    2.  The purchasing department holds a departmental meeting once a week to use criticism and self-criticism as weapons to check each other's work and exchange experience.
    3.  In order to strengthen contact with the materials department, a telephone reporting system has been established, and market information has been established. In this way, it is possible to contact the purchasing units of this road in time to exchange experience and understand the situation.
    4.  In terms of acceptance, we must regularly review and understand, and conduct ideological education for staff at any time. For important or large-scale receipts, we must personally go down to understand.
    Sixth, because I had a serious bureaucratic style in my previous work, and the work was rough and careless, the property of the state suffered a major loss. In addition to sincerely accepting the instructions and criticisms of the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee, thanking the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee and the Wuhan organs for their help, and conducting self-examination, I guarantee to accept the lessons of this incident, strengthen vigilance in future work, check shortcomings at any time, improve working methods, and run the people's railway cause well.

### 关于我厂购料人员和奸商勾结侵害国家财产案件的检讨

    关于我厂购料人员和奸商勾结侵害国家财产案件的检讨
    衡阳铁路局武昌材料厂厂长  崔保堂
    我厂自一九四九年起在武汉市采购铁路所用器材。因为我有严重的官僚主义作风，对采购工作不重视，不深入了解工作人员的思想情况，因而对白合金、油漆等贪污案，到一九五○年十月间才发觉。现在检讨如下：
    第一、以往购买材料时，都是先由采购股在厂内开标比价，由商人把标出的各种材料抄去，第二天再来报价。我们厂再把商人所报的价格比较一下，有时我们也盲目减价。这种方式不但给奸商以串通的机会，而且奸商可以大肆抬价，预先准备着我们减价。这种不合理的工作方式，我当时没有能够加以分析研究，竟任其发展。
    第二、武汉市工商局在一九四九年十二月二十五日曾在长江日报登载“关于机关部队在本市各私营工厂代为加工或定货必须通过工商局”的公告，但我对这个公告并没有重视。
    第三、验收材料是一项重要工作。但以往每次验收大批材料，我都只是单纯依靠验收人员。我没有认识到验收材料是材料厂的重要工作。
    第四、本厂前验收员汪惠安原是汉口市五金业的学徒。在解放前他虽已参加铁路工作，但常和商人勾结。武汉市解放后，汪犯假装积极。这些情况我都没有及时察觉，仍派他担任验收工作，致发生白合金贪污案。
    第五、针对以上的缺点，我提出并已经部分地实行了如下的改进办法：
    一、采购材料时必须经过工商管理机关，并认真研究质量；需要化验的必须先化验，然后再计算它的成本和价格。
    二、采购股每星期召开股务会议一次，以批评和自我批评的武器互相检查工作，并交流经验。
    三、为和材料处加强联系，订立了电话汇报制度，并建立了行情通报。这样就能和本路各采购单位及时取得联系，交流经验，了解情况。
    四、验收方面，要经常审查了解，并随时向工作人员进行思想教育。重要的或大批的收料，必须亲自下去了解。
    第六、因为我以往在工作中有着严重的官僚主义作风，工作粗枝大叶，所以使国家财产遭受了重大损失。我除诚恳地接受中南人民监察委员会对我们的指示和批评，感谢中南人民监察委员会及武汉各机关对我们的帮助，并进行自我检讨以外，保证接受这次事件的教训，在今后工作中加强警惕，随时检查缺点，改进工作方法，办好人民铁道事业。
