    I Want to Overcome the Decadent Thoughts Bred After Entering the City in This Ideological Remolding Movement
    To the Editor: After studying the documents on the ideological remolding of intellectuals, I realize that as an intellectual who has moved from the countryside to work in the city, my thinking has become somewhat decadent, and therefore I also need to be remolded.

    I am a person who grew up in the countryside. When I first joined the revolution, I was very capable of enduring hardship. But after moving from the countryside to a prosperous big city, I thought: Now things are going to be alright, after living in the mountains for these past few years, it's time to enjoy life! Therefore, I demanded that my living conditions be improved as much as possible and my workload reduced as much as possible; all I thought about all day long was not how to improve my work, but some private small calculations. I disliked the uniforms issued by the public, wanting to buy fashionable ones from clothing stores; I didn't want to wear shoes with patches, fearing that people would laugh at me; I considered those comrades who were hardworking and simple in their lifestyle to have a "peasant mentality," not "generous" enough, and "embarrassing" in the city; I praised those comrades who were extravagant and wasteful, calling them "generous" and having enough "city style"; I also looked forward to the implementation of the salary system, bringing my wife over, and establishing a happy small family; in learning, I neglected politics, thinking that having a set of "professional skills" would be enough to get by, I neither wanted to read newspapers nor did I often read the documents issued by the Party; when forced to read them, I just skimmed through them perfunctorily.

    In short, my thinking is regressing, and I am being eroded by bourgeois ideology. I am gradually heading towards the dangerous situation of degeneration, deterioration, luxury, and corruption!

    Why did I develop such thoughts? The main reason is that I come from the petty bourgeoisie and have a strong bourgeois selfish and individualistic ideology, and I cannot withstand the test under the victorious situation. Therefore, I am now determined to wash away these shortcomings in this great ideological remolding movement, devote myself to the great construction cause of the motherland, and earnestly temper myself and remold myself, so as to become a soldier with high revolutionary qualities, and fight to the end for the interests of the Party and the people.
                                                                                                        Wang Shutang

    我要在这次思想改造运动中克服进城后滋生的蜕化思想
    编辑同志：学习了关于知识分子思想改造的文件，我认识到我这个知识分子，从农村转到城市工作以来，思想已经有些蜕化，因而我也有改造的必要。
    我是一个生长在农村的人，刚参加革命时很能吃苦。但从农村转到繁华的大城市，就这样想：这下子可行了，住了这几年的山沟，可到了享福的时候了！于是，我要求生活尽量改善，工作尽量减少；脑子里整天所考虑的，不是如何搞好业务，而是些私人小打算。我嫌公家发的制服不好，要到服装店去买时样的；鞋子有了补绽不愿穿，怕人家见笑；对那些在生活作风上艰苦朴素的同志，认为他们有“农民意识”，不“大方”，在城市“丢人”；对那些铺张浪费的同志，反称赞他们“大方”，够得上“城市派头”；又盼望实行薪金制，把老婆接来，建立个美满的小家庭；在学习上，是忽视政治，认为有套“业务能力”就吃得开，对报纸既不愿读，党内发给的文件也不常看；逼着看时，就走马观花地应付应付。
    总之，我的思想是在后退，是被资产阶级思想所侵蚀了。我是逐渐走向蜕化变质、奢侈腐化的危境了！
    我为什么会产生这样的思想呢？主要就是因为我出身于小资产阶级，有着浓厚的资产阶级自私自利、个人主义的思想，在胜利的形势下经不起考验。因此，我现在决心在这个伟大的思想改造运动中，洗刷这些毛病，投身到祖国伟大的建设事业中去，认真锻炼自己、改造自己，以使自己成为一个具有高度革命品质的战士，为党和人民的利益奋斗到底。                    王淑唐
