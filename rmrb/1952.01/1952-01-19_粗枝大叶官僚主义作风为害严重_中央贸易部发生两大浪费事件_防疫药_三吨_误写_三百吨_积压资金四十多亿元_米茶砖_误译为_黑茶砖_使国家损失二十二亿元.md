The careless and bureaucratic work style is extremely harmful.

Two Major Wasteful Incidents in the Central Trade Department

"Three Tons" of Epidemic Prevention Medicine Mistakenly Written as "Three Hundred Tons," Resulting in Over 4 Billion Yuan in Frozen Funds; "Rice Tea Brick" Mistranslated as "Dark Tea Brick," Causing a National Loss of 2.2 Billion Yuan

Last year, the Central People's Government Ministry of Trade ordered foot-and-mouth disease prevention medicine from the Soviet Union. Due to the careless and bureaucratic work style of the cadres, "three tons" was mistakenly written as "three hundred tons." As a result, 297 tons were purchased in excess, causing a serious waste of over 4 billion yuan in frozen funds. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administrative Council has issued a circular giving the personnel involved the punishment they deserve.

In January of last year, foot-and-mouth disease broke out among cattle and sheep in Xinjiang Province. The Northwest Military and Political Committee telegraphed the Administrative Council requesting the purchase of three tons of the epidemic prevention medicine "Gialin" from the Soviet Union. After receiving the telephone notification about this matter, Lu Hong, the chief of the Export Section of the Soviet Union Department of the Foreign Trade Bureau of the Central Trade Department, inquired about this telegram from the relevant departments. However, because the Administrative Council had already directly approved the telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it could not be found. Lu Hong felt the matter was urgent. After consulting with Yang Jintao, the deputy director of the Soviet Union Department of the Foreign Trade Bureau, he went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to transcribe the telegram. When Lu Hong transcribed the telegram, he mistakenly copied "three tons" as "three hundred tons" and used this figure to place an order with the Soviet Commercial Representative Office. By February and March of last year, all 300 tons of this medicine had been shipped to Xinjiang. This resulted in the purchase of 297 tons more than originally needed. Although the extra medicine could be used later, the error was too great, freezing over 4 billion yuan of capital and causing a serious waste of state property.

The reason for this waste was, on the one hand, due to Lu Hong's serious careless work style. On the other hand, it also shows that the leading cadres of the Ministry of Trade have a serious bureaucratic work style, and have not established a strict work system. Therefore, when dealing with payments, orders, budgets and other matters, a review and verification system was not established. This prevented Lu Hong's mistake from being discovered and corrected in time.

After this incident occurred, the Ministry of Trade reported to the Administrative Council. Premier Zhou approved it to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Administrative Council for handling. Now, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Administrative Council has issued a circular deciding to give Lu Hong a major demerit; and to give the leading cadres of the Ministry of Trade a criticism and punishment. It is also stipulated that in the future, all financial and economic departments must write clearly when writing payment, order, budget and other related figures, and must go through review, verification and other procedures before they can be approved. (Reported by the Central Financial and Economic Committee Reporting Group)

The translators of the Central People's Government Ministry of Trade have a serious careless work style, mistranslating "rice tea brick" as "dark tea brick." The leading cadres of the China Tea Company failed to correct this mistake in time, resulting in overproduction of dark tea bricks and a national loss of 2.2 billion yuan.

This happened in 1950: The Soviet Union requested a large supply of rice tea bricks from our country, but the translators of the Central Trade Department mistranslated it as dark tea bricks. The China Tea Company then arranged a large production task for dark tea bricks. During the period of purchasing raw tea, Huang Guoguang, the deputy manager of the China Tea Company, and Hu Haochuan, the chief technician, had noticed this, but because they were irresponsible for state property, they did not correct it. Later, after repeated requests from the Hangzhou branch of the Tea Company and repeated proposals from comrades, Huang Guoguang and Hu Haochuan replied to the Hangzhou branch: "The Soviet Union initially wanted dark tea bricks, but later changed to rice tea bricks. The factory construction will be temporarily suspended, and the machines will be installed as usual." However, this error was not corrected in other regions. This resulted in overproduction of dark tea bricks, which could not be sold. The current inventory of dark tea bricks can still be supplied for two years. The loss of interest alone on the frozen funds is as high as 2.2 billion yuan.

### 粗枝大叶官僚主义作风为害严重  中央贸易部发生两大浪费事件  防疫药“三吨”误写“三百吨”积压资金四十多亿元“米茶砖”误译为“黑茶砖”使国家损失二十二亿元

    粗枝大叶官僚主义作风为害严重
    中央贸易部发生两大浪费事件
    防疫药“三吨”误写“三百吨”积压资金四十多亿元“米茶砖”误译为“黑茶砖”使国家损失二十二亿元
    中央人民政府贸易部去年向苏联订购防治口蹄疫药品，由于干部有粗枝大叶和官僚主义作风，把“三吨”误写成“三百吨”，结果多买了二百九十七吨，造成积压资金四十多亿元的严重浪费现象。中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会已发出通报，给有关人员以应得的处分。
    去年一月间新疆省发生牛羊口蹄疫，西北军政委员会曾电请政务院向苏联订购防疫药品“吉阿林”三吨。中央贸易部国外贸易司苏联处出口科科长陆红在接到关于这件事情的电话通知以后，就向有关部门查询这份电报；但因政务院已经把电报直接批给外交部，所以没有查着，陆红因为感到事关急要，经请示国外贸易司苏联处副处长杨金涛后，就前往外交部摘抄电报。陆红在抄电文时，把“三吨”误抄为“三百吨”，就用这数字向苏联商务代表处提出定货。到去年二、三月间，这项药品三百吨便全部运到新疆。这样就比原来需要量多买了二百九十七吨。虽然多买的药品以后还可以使用，但因差错太大，积压资金人民币四十多亿元，造成国家资财的严重浪费。
    发生这种浪费的原因，一方面是由于陆红有严重的粗枝大叶作风；另一方面也说明了贸易部领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，没有建立严密的工作制度，因而在处理支付、定购、预算及其他事项时，并没有建立起复核校对等制度。这就使陆红的错误不能及时被发现和纠正。
    这事发生后，贸易部曾呈报政务院，经周总理批交政务院财政经济委员会处理，现在政务院财政经济委员会已发出通报，决定给陆红记大过一次；给贸易部领导干部以批评处分。并规定：今后财政经济各部门在书写支付、定购、预算及其他等有关数字时，都要写清楚，并且要经过复核、校对等手续，才能批发。（中央财政经济委员会报道组）
    中央人民政府贸易部翻译人员，工作上有严重的粗枝大叶作风，将“米茶砖”误译成“黑茶砖”，中国茶业公司领导干部没有能够及时纠正这个错误，以致黑茶砖生产太多，使国家损失二十二亿元。
    这是一九五零年的事情：苏联要求我国供应大量米茶砖，中央贸易部翻译人员误译成黑茶砖，中国茶业公司就布置了大量生产黑茶砖的任务。在收购毛茶期间，中国茶业公司副经理黄国光、总技师胡浩川已察觉，但由于他们对国家财产不负责任，毫不加纠正。后经茶业公司杭州分公司迭次请求和同志们一再提出，黄国光、胡浩川才答复杭州分公司：“苏联先要黑茶砖，后改要米茶砖，现在厂房暂缓建设，机器照常设置。”但对其他地区则没有纠正这一错误。这就使黑茶砖生产太多，无法销售。现在积存的黑茶砖，还可供销两年。仅积压资金利息一项损失，就有二十二亿元之多。
