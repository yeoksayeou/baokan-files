    Tianjin People from All Walks of Life Hold a Rally of Over 30,000 to Expose and Accuse, Concentrating Firepower to Suppress Corrupt and Bribery-Giving Elements
    The Rally Received Over 30,000 Cases of Expose and Confessions
    The Tianjin Municipal People from All Walks of Life held a confession and accusation rally against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy on the 16th. Over 30,000 people from all walks of life attended, and over one million people from all walks of life listened to the live broadcast of the rally. This marks a great march by the broad masses of the people in Tianjin against corruption, waste, bureaucracy, and acts of bribery, tax evasion, and fraud against state property. It signifies that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Tianjin has entered a new high tide.
    The rally began with a speech by Huang Huoqing, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Thrift Examination Committee. He pointed out: The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Tianjin has been launched vigorously. Its content has also become richer as it has moved from internal reform within organizations to social reform. This battle has begun to enter a basic defense line, and firepower will be concentrated on departments with greater and more corruption and on the acts of capitalists who bribe, evade taxes, and commit fraud. This is a serious revolutionary struggle. He called on people from all walks of life to actively participate in this struggle and, through today's rally, push the movement to a new high tide and achieve a new and complete victory!
    Then came the confession and accusation. Wang Shili, a cadre of the Eighth Branch of the Tianjin Tax Bureau, confessed at the meeting that he could not resist the temptation of奸商 (crafty merchants) and engaged in corruption and bribery. He joined the revolution in his teens and served as a platoon leader in the People's Liberation Army. After the liberation of Tianjin, he was sent to a slaughterhouse in Tianjin to work as a cattle inspector. At that time, he was commended by his superiors for refusing bribes from奸商 (crafty merchants). He said: Later, the奸商 (crafty merchants) surrounded me, took me out to eat and watch plays, gave clothes to my children, and gave rings to my wife, attacking me step by step. I gradually became corrupt and degenerate, and later even partnered with奸商 (crafty merchants) such as Mu Xiangren in business. I used my position to accept bribes from奸商 (crafty merchants) amounting to more than two million yuan, and I became much more lenient when inspecting cattle for slaughter. In the past six months, they slaughtered a total of three to four thousand cattle that should not have been slaughtered, causing incalculable losses to the country's production and construction. Xu Demeng, a cadre of the Tianjin Branch of the China National Import and Export Corporation, confessed at the meeting that he was seduced by奸商 (crafty merchants) from Yutai Foreign Firm into accepting bribes, allowing the奸商 (crafty merchants) to steal a large amount of state assets. Zhang Jinzhou, Deputy Manager of the private Northeast Construction Wood Factory, and Cui Shukun, Manager of the Central Pharmacy, confessed at the meeting to their crimes of using despicable means to bribe cadres in order to illegally seek exorbitant profits. Zhang Jinzhou said: I didn't want to confess a few days ago and even made a "defense alliance" with the cadres who accepted bribes, but in recent days I felt "besieged on all sides," and even my children repeatedly mobilized me to confess, saying, "If you don't confess, I will expose you!" Under the pressure of the masses, I began to repent. Then, Zhang Wenrui, a clerk at the private Tongtai Trading Company, publicly accused Zhang Lianke and Wang Shanji, the managers of the company, of using codes in telegrams to exchange market information and trade gold, evading a total of 2.98 billion yuan in RMB. Chen Shuhua, a representative of the clerks from the Sixth District of Tianjin, took the stage to accuse. He accused Jia Shoushan, manager of Changji Wood Firm, and Zhao Qinzhen, deputy manager, of undermining the anti-bribery movement and forcing the clerk Zhang Yuting, who exposed him, to death. He said: Comrade Zhang Yuting publicly accused Jia Shoushan and others of illegally bribing cadres and defrauding state property on January 9. These two奸商 (crafty merchants) held a grudge. On the evening of the 14th, they summoned Zhang Yuting to a meeting under the pretext of checking the firm's accounts. This meeting was arranged by them in advance. At the meeting, they attacked Zhang Yuting together, distorted the policies of the People's Government, and threatened him, saying, "You have exposed me, you can't escape either!" After a night of meetings, Zhang Yuting was forced to the point of no return and committed suicide the next day. Chen Shuhua demanded that the government severely punish these two奸商 (crafty merchants). After his accusation, many people called and wrote to the conference, demanding that the government immediately arrest the two奸商 (crafty merchants) Jia Shoushan and Zhao Qinzhen and give them severe punishment. At this time, the conference announced: The two奸商 (crafty merchants) Jia Shoushan and others have been arrested by the People's Government and will be publicly tried soon. The participants responded with warm cheers and applause.
    Following this, representatives from all walks of life spoke. Liu Ya, a worker representative, said: In the past ten days, shop assistants throughout the city have exposed more than 18,000 cases of corruption and bribery. Many shop assistants in private shops, unafraid of the threats from the capitalists, have unreservedly exposed the criminal acts of illegal private merchants. In the future, we must continue to participate in this struggle. Li Zhuchen, a representative of the industrial and commercial sector, said: All industries and trades in Tianjin have held mobilization meetings, and many merchants have successively confessed. However, there are still many merchants who are waiting and watching, avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial, and even adopting a passively resistant attitude. He called on the industrial and commercial sector to make the greatest and final determination to thoroughly confess illegal acts such as bribery, tax evasion, theft, and fraud, and to eradicate the corrupt and degenerate thoughts of the bourgeoisie! Fan Shuzhen, a women's representative, Yan Chengzong, a youth representative, and Mu Zhifang, a Hui Muslim representative, also unanimously expressed their determination to continue to deepen the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle.
    Finally, Mayor Huang Jing made a concluding speech. He said: The conference received a total of more than 30,000 cases of accusations and confessions. This shows that the people of the city hate corrupt elements, hate bribery-givers, and hate illegal merchants. With such enthusiasm and a clear understanding of right and wrong, we have the confidence and assurance to completely eliminate these phenomena. Huang Jing demanded that the industrial and commercial sector undergo a thorough transformation and completely oppose all bad habits and immoral behaviors. He emphasized: Industrial and commercial operators are only allowed to engage in legitimate business, not illegal activities; they are only allowed to have legitimate profits, not to secretly collude with cadres for personal gain. Otherwise, it will be detrimental to the country, the people, and the industrial and commercial operators themselves. The industrial and commercial sector should consciously launch a movement against bribery, tax evasion, and fraud against state property. In this way, the government's staff can maintain their purity, give full play to the role of the People's Government, and enable the industrial and commercial sector to embark on a healthy and normal track.
    During the conference, the masses listening to the broadcast were in high spirits. Many people wrote letters and made phone calls to the conference, requesting to confess or accuse at the conference. Shen Jiaxiu, Assistant Manager of the China Industrial Bank, expressed his determination to confess his past illegal activities. All the clerks in the Seventh and Tenth Districts pledged to the conference to wage a resolute and merciless struggle against the illegal merchants who refused to confess. After listening to her father's confession, Zhang Lanxiang, the daughter of Zhang Jinzhou, Deputy Manager of the Northeast Construction Wood Factory, wrote a letter to the conference reporting the process of her mobilizing her father to confess, and said: For all those who engage in corrupt acts, whether they are fathers, husbands, or brothers, we must mobilize them to confess. If they do not confess, in order to love our country, we must break through all considerations and expose them. Various receiving units continuously called the conference to report on the situation of confession and accusation. By the end of the conference, more than 26,000 people had confessed and accused a total of 34,840 cases of corruption and bribery.

    天津各界人民三万多人举行检举大会
    集中火力围剿贪污行贿分子
    大会收到三万多件检举和坦白出的案件
    天津市各界人民反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义坦白检举大会在十六日举行。到会的有各界人民三万余人，收听大会广播实况的各界人民有一百多万人。这是天津市广大人民向贪污、浪费、官僚主义以及行贿、偷税、欺诈国家财产等行为的大进军。它标志着天津市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动进入一个新的高潮。
    大会首由天津市节约检查委员会副主任黄火青讲话。他指出：天津市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，已经轰轰烈烈地发动起来了。它的内容也因从机关内部改造走向社会改造而更丰富。这个战斗已经开始进入一条基本防线，火力将集中到贪污更大更多的部门和资本家行贿、偷税、欺诈的行为上。这是一场严重的革命斗争。他号召各界人民积极参加这个斗争，并通过今天的大会把运动推向新的高潮，使运动取得新的彻底的胜利！
    接着就进行坦白检举。天津税务局第八分局干部王世礼在会上坦白了自己经不起奸商的引诱而贪污受贿的行为。他从十几岁就参加了革命，做过解放军的排长。天津解放后，他被派到天津市某屠宰场做验牛工作，当时曾因为拒绝奸商的贿赂受到上级的表扬。他说：后来奸商包围了我，拉我吃饭看戏，给小孩送衣服，给我老婆送戒指，一步一步向我进攻，我就逐渐地腐化堕落起来，后来竟和奸商穆祥仁等合股作生意。我利用职权接受奸商们的贿赂二百多万元，而我在检验宰牛的时候就对他们放松多了，很好的耕牛也允许他们宰杀。半年来，他们共宰了三四千头不该宰的耕牛，使国家生产建设受到难以计算的损失。中国进出口公司天津分公司干部徐德孟，在会上坦白了他被裕泰洋行奸商勾引受贿，因而使奸商得以大量偷盗国家资财的事实。私营东北建筑木厂副经理张锦洲和中央药房经理崔书琨在会上坦白了他们利用卑鄙手段贿赂干部非法牟取暴利的罪行。张锦洲说：我前几天还不想坦白，并且和受贿干部订立了“攻守同盟”，但是近几天来觉得“四面楚歌”，连自己的儿女也屡次动员我坦白，并且说：“你不坦白我就检举你！”在群众的压力下，我才开始悔悟。接着私营同泰贸易行店员张文瑞当众检举了该行经理张连科、王善继在电报中用暗号互通行情，买卖黄金，先后逃汇计合人民币二十九亿八千多万元。天津市六区店员代表陈树华登台控诉。他控诉长记木行经理贾寿山、副经理赵勤珍破坏反行贿运动，逼死检举他的店员张玉亭的罪行。他说：张玉亭同志在一月九日当众检举了贾寿山等二人贿赂干部、欺诈国家财产的非法行为后，这两个奸商就怀恨在心，十四日晚他们借检查本号账目为名，找张玉亭开会，这个会是他们布置好了的。会上他们一齐向张玉亭进攻，歪曲人民政府政策，威胁他说：“你检举了我，你也跑不了！”开了一夜会，张玉亭被他们逼得无路可走，第二天就自杀了。陈树华要求政府严厉制裁这两个奸商。他控诉以后，很多人向大会打电话、写信，要求政府马上逮捕贾寿山、赵勤珍两个奸商，并给予严惩。这时，大会宣布：贾寿山等两个奸商已被人民政府逮捕，并将在最近举行公审。与会群众报以热烈的欢呼和掌声。
    继有各界代表讲话。工人代表刘亚说：过去十天中全市店员已检举了贪污行贿事件一万八千多起。许多私营商店的店员不怕资方威胁，毫不顾虑地检举不法私商的罪恶行为。今后我们一定要继续参加这一斗争。工商界代表李烛尘说：天津市工商界各行业都召开了动员大会，许多商户相继坦白。但是还有不少商户存在着等待观望、避重就轻、说小不说大甚至消极抵抗的态度。他号召工商界必须下最大最后的决心，把行贿、偷税、盗窃、欺诈等非法行为彻底坦白出来，把资产阶级腐化堕落思想挖掉！妇女代表范淑贞、青年代表阎承宗、回民代表穆芝房也一致表示：继续深入开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。
    最后，由黄敬市长作结论。他说：大会收到检举、坦白案件共三万多件。这说明全市人民痛恨贪污分子，痛恨行贿分子，痛恨不法商人。有了这样的热情和认清是非的态度，就使我们有信心、有把握来彻底肃清这些现象。黄敬要求工商业界进行彻底的改造，把一切坏习气、不道德的行为彻底反对掉。他着重地说：工商业者只许作正当营业，不许作非法勾当；只许有正当利润，不许偷偷摸摸勾引干部营私舞弊。不这样，对国家、对人民、对于工商业者本身都是不利的。工商业界应该自觉地来开展反行贿、反偷税、反诈骗国家财产的运动。这样，才能使政府机关的工作人员保持住纯洁，发挥人民政府的作用，并使工商业界走上健康、正常的轨道。
    在大会进行当中，收听广播的群众情绪高涨。很多人给大会写信、打电话、要求到大会上坦白或检举。中国实业银行襄理沈家修表示决心坦白过去的非法行为。七、十区全体店员向大会保证和拒不坦白的不法商人作坚决无情的斗争。东北建筑木厂副经理张锦洲的女儿张兰湘在听了她父亲的坦白后，给大会写信报告她动员她父亲坦白的经过，并且说：对于一切贪污行为的人，不管他是父亲、丈夫或兄弟，都要动员他坦白。他要是不坦白，为了爱我们的国家，我们就要打破一切顾虑把他检举出来。各收听单位不断给大会打电话报告坦白检举情况，截至大会结束前，有两万六千多人坦白、检举了贪污行贿的案件共三万四千八百四十件。
