Dearest compatriots and comrades of the motherland:

It has been two and a half months since I left you and returned to the Korean front! In these two and a half months, I have made 43 reports to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army comrades who are fighting on the front lines. Recently, I went to the familiar Third Company of a certain regiment – the Yang Gensi Company – named after the immortal hero Comrade Yang Gensi, and gave a report. On the distant Korean front, I reported to you with great excitement about the situation of the Yang Gensi Company, which you care about and love.

On the morning of December 6th, Comrade Zheng Guanghong, Political Commissar of a certain regiment of the Volunteer Army, personally accompanied me to the heroic Yang Gensi Company to give a report. It was 20 li from the regimental headquarters to the Yang Gensi Company's station, and we had to cross a high mountain with an altitude of 1,000 meters. The mountain was covered with snow. After crossing this mountain, not far away was the position guarded by the heroic Yang Gensi Company. The comrades of the Yang Gensi Company were engaged in intense military training in the intervals between battles, and were building air-raid shelters, collecting firewood, and preparing for the winter. A large air-raid shelter that could accommodate the entire company for meetings and classes, with hot kang (heated brick bed) facilities, was under construction. They vigilantly guarded their positions, constantly strengthening fortifications, and were ready to give the invading enemy a severe blow at any time. Excavating fortifications on a completely rocky mountain, with inadequate tools, was a very difficult project. The soldiers overcame the difficulties they encountered with a tenacious fighting spirit and hard work. Once, Comrade Chen Jun of the Sixth Squad, when encountering a hard boulder, stood up and said: "We must treat the stone as an enemy, we must defeat the enemy." Communist Party member Lei Yongguang said: "We can defeat living enemies, we can definitely defeat dead stones!" They came up with many ways to deal with the stones, and even compiled a jingle: "Burn it with fire and pour cold water on it, hammer it with a hammer and knock it with an iron bar, use a pickaxe to find a crack, dig it out and bury it." Once, they dug a 200-meter-deep "cave room fortification". All the pickaxes of the entire company were worn down by two-thirds, and there was not a single comrade whose hands were not blistered. When they first arrived at the position, life was very hard for a while. There were no vegetables, and there was a lack of oil and salt. They sent eight comrades to help the people dig radishes, and brought back the radish leaves that the people did not want to eat as vegetables. The eight people picked more than 4,000 radish leaves. They were reluctant to eat them all at once, and some are still pickled there. The soldiers of the Yang Gensi Company said: "During the Fifth Battle, we once went three days without food, and captured five hilltops on empty stomachs. What's a little less oil, salt, and vegetables?" The soldiers of the immortal hero Yang Gensi Company, with the glorious tradition of being brave, tenacious, and hardworking, are always victors in the face of hardship and difficulty.

Every soldier in the Yang Gensi Company is familiar with the heroic deeds of the martyr Yang Gensi. Every soldier considers it an unparalleled honor to be a soldier in the Yang Gensi Company. Learning from Comrade Yang Gensi's brave and tenacious fighting spirit based on a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and avenging Comrade Yang Gensi, has become the responsibility of every comrade. This sense of responsibility is implemented in all their practical actions in combat, work, and study. In the Third Battle, the entire Yang Gensi Company was awarded a collective First Class Merit, and the Second Squad, Third Squad, and Seventh Squad were also awarded collective merits. Once, they were conducting military training in the position. Fan Zisan, an old soldier of the Yang Gensi Company, hypothesized a situation to another new soldier, saying: "You and two other comrades are going to carry out the task of blasting the enemy's forward position. If two comrades are killed or wounded on the way, what will you do?" The new soldier replied: "I will continue to charge forward!" He was asked again: "You will still charge forward alone? What gives you such courage?" He replied: "It is my firm determination to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country!" He also said: "As long as the blasting mission can be completed, even if I sacrifice, the whole squad, the whole platoon, and the whole company can charge in, and I will avenge the hatred of the martyr Company Commander Yang Gensi!"

On the afternoon of December 6th, all the comrades of the Yang Gensi Company listened enthusiastically to my four-hour report in a mountain gully. The great achievements of the motherland's various construction undertakings in the past year, the determination of the people of the motherland to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, and their love for the Volunteer Army, greatly encouraged the comrades of the Yang Gensi Company!

Comrade Qi Lidian of the Seventh Squad said: "After hearing the report from the returning representative, I have a clear picture of the situation in the motherland. Hearing the many vivid examples in the report makes me very excited. The old ladies in the motherland are afraid that we will lose weight. I will never forget the deep concern of the people of the motherland for us." Comrade Zeng Fanhe said: "The people of the motherland are supporting us with all their strength, hoping that we will fiercely strike the invading U.S. imperialist aggressor troops. In order to protect the people of the motherland and have a good life forever, even if I sacrifice in battle, it is glorious!" Xiong Yuanqing, the former comrade-in-arms of Yang Gensi, and now the Deputy Platoon Leader of the Third Platoon named after the hero Yang Gensi, said: "The examples of the deep concern and love of the compatriots and comrades of the motherland for our Volunteer Army make me deeply feel that it is an unparalleled honor to be a Volunteer Army soldier – especially a soldier of the heroic Yang Gensi Company! I want to learn and carry forward Comrade Yang Gensi's tradition of brave and tenacious fighting, lead the comrades of the entire platoon well, strive for greater merits, and create greater honor for the people of the motherland!" In order to thank the compatriots and comrades of the motherland for their support, all the comrades of the Yang Gensi Company unanimously decided to write a letter to the General Association of the Chinese People's Resistance Against America and Aid Korea and to the people of the whole country. In their letter, they wrote: "After hearing the report of Comrade Dong Lefu, the returning representative, we heard the voices of the 500 million people of the motherland, and we know that the motherland is in a period of rapid progress. We feel that the motherland is great and lovable, so we hate the enemy even more, and we have strengthened our determination and confidence to defend the motherland and completely defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors! ... We are a company named after the glorious name of the hero Company Commander Yang Gensi. In the arduous and tense battle and work, everyone gains strength when they think of our hero Company Commander Yang Gensi. After listening to the report of the returning representative, all our comrades unanimously expressed that we will work harder to improve our combat skills, eliminate more enemies in battle, and strive for greater glory to answer the love of the people of the motherland for us. ..."

All the comrades who have heard our reports on the front lines, like the comrades of the Yang Gensi Company, sincerely thank the people of the motherland! Many comrades said with emotion: "The people of the motherland are so lovable and care about us so much!" Thousands of Volunteer Army soldiers said in unison: "We will only work harder to improve our combat skills, resolutely eliminate the invading aggressor troops, and strive for a complete victory in resisting America and aiding Korea to answer the people of the motherland!"

    英雄杨根思连队感谢祖国人民深切的关怀
    ——中国人民志愿军归国代表团代表董乐辅给祖国人民的一封信亲爱的祖国同胞、同志们：
    离开你们重返朝鲜前线已经两个半月了！两个半月时间中，我在前线向正在战斗着的中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军同志们作了四十三次报告，最近我到了你们所熟悉的，以不朽的英雄杨根思同志的名字命名的某团三连——杨根思连作了一次报告。我在遥远的朝鲜前线战地上，以十分兴奋的心情，向你们汇报你们所关怀与热爱的杨根思连的情况。
    十二月六日清早，志愿军某团政治委员郑光宏同志亲自陪同我到英雄杨根思连作报告，从团部到杨根思连驻地有二十里路，中间要翻越一座海拔一千公尺的高山，山上积满了皑皑白雪，翻过这座山，不远就是英雄杨根思连队扼守的阵地。杨根思连的同志们在阵地上利用战斗间隙时间进行着紧张的练兵，和构筑防空洞、打柴火、准备过冬。一个可以容纳全连开会上课的、里面有热炕设备的大防空洞正在建造中。他们警惕地守卫在自己的阵地上，不断加强工事，随时准备给予进犯的敌人以严重的打击。在完全是岩石的山上挖掘工事，工具又不齐备的情况下，是一件十分艰巨的工程，战士们以顽强的战斗精神和艰苦的劳动，终于克服了他们曾遇到的困难。有一次六班战士陈钧同志，在遇见坚硬的大石块时，站起来说：“要把石头当敌人，我们一定要战胜敌人。”共产党员雷永光说：“活的敌人我们都能战胜它，死的石头我们一定可以战胜它！”他们想出了很多对付石块的办法，并且编成了顺口溜：“火烧冷水浇，铁锤打啦铁棒敲，十字镐来找条缝，弄出来挖个坑来埋掉它。”一次，他们挖成一个二百公尺深长的“洞穴室工事”，全连所有十字镐都磨短了三分之二，没有一个同志手上不起血泡的。初到阵地上有一个时期生活很艰苦，没有菜蔬，缺乏油盐，他们便派出八个同志去帮助老百姓挖萝卜，把老百姓不要的萝卜叶子拿回来做菜吃，八个人摘回来四千多个萝卜叶子，他们舍不得一下子全部吃光，现在还有一部腌在那里。杨根思连的战士说：“第五次战役中，有一次我们曾经三天吃不上饭，饿着肚子拿下了五个山头，少吃点油盐菜蔬有啥。”有着英勇顽强、艰苦奋斗的光荣传统的不朽的英雄杨根思连的战士们，在艰苦与困难面前永远是胜利者。
    杨根思连每一个战士都熟知先烈杨根思英雄的事迹，每个战士都把在杨根思连当一名战士引为无尚光荣，学习杨根思同志以高度的爱国主义国际主义思想为基础的英勇顽强的战斗精神，为杨根思同志报仇，成为每一个同志应有的责任。这种责任感贯彻在他们一切战斗、工作和学习的实际行动中。第三次战役中，杨根思连全体立了一次一等功，二班、三班、七班也都立了集体功。一次，他们在阵地上进行练兵，杨根思连老战士范子三假设了一个情况向另外一个新战士说：“你和另外两个同志一块儿去执行爆破敌人前沿阵地的任务，如果半路上二个同志都伤亡了，你怎么办？”这位新战士答：“我继续冲上去！”又问他：“剩下你一个人还冲上去？凭什么你有这么大的勇气？”答：“凭我抗美援朝保家卫国的坚强决心！”他又说：“只要爆破任务能完成，即使我牺牲了，全班全排全连就能冲进去，我和先烈杨根思连长的仇也报了！”
    十二月六日下午，杨根思连全体同志在一条山沟里，满怀热情的静听了我四个小时报告，祖国一年来各项建设工作巨大的成就，祖国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的决心，与热爱志愿军的心情，大大鼓舞了杨根思连的同志们！
    七班战士戚黎点同志说：“祖国情况经归国代表一报告心里就明亮了，听了报告中许多生动事例心里真兴奋，祖国老太太们怕我们瘦了，我永远不能忘记祖国人民对我们这样深切的关怀。”曾凡和同志说：“祖国人民拿一切力量支援我们，希望我们狠狠地打击进犯的美帝国主义侵略军队，为保卫祖国人民永远过好日子，我即使在战斗中牺牲了也是光荣的！”杨根思同志生前的战友，现任以杨根思英雄的名字命名的第三排副排长熊原清同志说：“祖国同胞同志们对我们志愿军的深切关怀与热爱的事例，使我深深地感到，作为志愿军——尤其是作为英雄杨根思连队的一个战士真是无尚光荣！我要学习与发扬杨根思同志英勇顽强战斗的传统，带好全排同志，争取立更大的功，为祖国人民创造更大的荣誉！”为了感谢祖国同胞同志们的支援，杨根思连全体同志一致通过给祖国抗美援朝总会及全国人民写一封信。他们在信里写道：“当我们听到了归国代表董乐辅同志的报告后，我们听到了祖国五万万人民的声音，知道祖国是在飞跃的进步中。我们感到祖国的伟大可爱，就更加仇恨敌人，增强了我们保卫祖国彻底打败美帝国主义侵略者的决心与信心！……我们是以英雄杨根思连长的光荣的名字命名的连队，在艰苦紧张的战斗和工作中，大家一想到我们的英雄连长杨根思同志就增加了力量，听了归国代表的报告，我们全体同志一致表示要更加倍努力提高作战本领，战斗中歼灭更多的敌人，争取更大的光荣，回答祖国人民对我们的热爱。……”
    在前线所有听过我们报告的同志们，都和杨根思连队的同志一样，衷心地感谢祖国人民！很多同志都感动地说：“祖国人民太可爱了，对我们太关切了！”千万个志愿军的战士同声地说：“只有更努力提高作战本领，坚决消灭进犯的侵略军，争取抗美援朝的彻底胜利来回答祖国的人民！”
