    On the Issue of Holding Social Dances in Government Agencies

    Editor: Social dancing is very popular in some government agencies in Kaifeng. Certain responsible comrades, after attending meetings in large cities such as Hankou, bring back music records, record players, and amplifiers, and promote the benefits of dancing in various ways, which makes the trend of dancing popular. Some agencies dance two or three times a week, each time for five or six hours, until late at night. Various holidays are never missed. The participants are very mixed. Some agencies sometimes use the excuse of entertaining international friends, hire famous chefs, host Western-style meals, and hold dances for over a hundred people, spending a lot on refreshments, fruits, and gasoline (to pick up some women who can dance), which is a considerable waste of financial resources. The music used for accompaniment at the dances is also problematic, sometimes being yellow music.

    What attitude should we take towards this issue?

    Editor's Note: We have recently received letters from readers in Guiyang, Kaifeng, and other places criticizing the social dances held in some government agencies. The letter published above is one of them. In addition to the shortcomings of the dances pointed out in this letter, many other readers have also pointed out in their letters that some dances last too long, disturbing the sleep of the surrounding neighbors and hindering work the next day. The use of yellow music and allowing non-working people to participate are particularly wrong. As for the waste of manpower and material resources, it is even more contrary to the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. We believe that these opinions are basically correct. Social dancing should be one of the legitimate forms of entertainment, but it must be treated with a proper attitude, and various malpractices should be prevented.

### 关于机关里举行交际舞会的问题

    关于机关里举行交际舞会的问题
    编辑同志：开封有些机关，非常流行交际舞。个别负责同志到汉口等大城市开会，带回音乐唱片、电唱机和扩音器，并多方宣传跳舞的好处；这就使得跳舞之风流行起来。有的机关，一星期跳两三次，每次五、六小时，直到深夜始散。各种节日，绝不放过。参加的人很杂。有的机关有时假借宴请国际友人名义，请了名厨，大办西餐，开百余人的舞会，耗费了不少茶点、水果和汽油（接一些能跳舞的女性），浪费的财力是可观的。舞会上用来伴奏的音乐也是有问题的，有时是黄色音乐。
    我们应该用什么态度来看这一个问题？
    叶年娟
    编者按：我们最近收到贵阳、开封等地一些读者来信，批评某些机关里举行的交际舞会。上面所刊登的是其中的一封信。除了这封信中所指出的舞会的缺点以外，其他许多读者在来信中还指出：有些舞会时间过长，既扰乱周围邻居安眠，更妨碍了次日的工作。采用黄色音乐和容许非劳动人民参加，尤其不对。至于浪费人力物力，更违背了增产节约的精神。我们认为，这些意见基本上都是对的。交际舞应该成为正当的娱乐之一，但必须用正当的态度来对待它，并应防止各种流弊。
