Hong Sun-cheol first explained that the mission of the Korean People's Delegation to China is to report to the Chinese people on the heroic struggle and combat deeds of the Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers in opposing the American aggressors, and to convey the Korean people's deep gratitude to the Chinese people for the great assistance given in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement.

Hong Sun-cheol praised the high prestige of the Chinese People's Volunteers among the Korean people. He said: The Volunteers not only fought the enemy bravely in the front, greatly encouraging the Korean people and army's confidence in victory, but also established a deep friendship with the Korean people like family members. It has become common for the Volunteer comrades to bravely rescue women, children, grain, and property under enemy bombing, and to help local people with labor. Therefore, the Korean people cherish the Volunteers as they cherish their own children. They automatically help the Volunteers with transportation, guiding the way, and sewing and washing clothes. Many Korean nurses eagerly donate blood to wounded Volunteer soldiers. The Korean people have generally recognized the Chinese People's Volunteers as a valiant, battle-skilled, and disciplined force that combines patriotism and internationalism.

    朝鲜人民代表团举行记者招待会
    洪淳哲团长报告访华任务并盛赞志愿军英勇善战
    【新华社二十日讯】朝鲜人民访华代表团二十日在此间举行记者招待会。该会由朝鲜人民访华代表团团长洪淳哲、副团长金朝奎主持。到会的有首都新闻工作者三十多人。朝鲜中央通讯社驻华总分社社长金圣容及朝鲜人民访华代表团中的朝鲜各通讯社、报社记者七人也参加了招待会。
    洪淳哲首先说明朝鲜人民访华代表团的任务是向中国人民报告朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军为反对美国侵略者而作的英勇斗争和战斗事迹，并将传达朝鲜人民对中国人民在抗美援朝运动中所给予的伟大援助的深切感谢；同时，代表团还要认真学习目前正在全中国轰轰烈烈地进行着的增产节约、反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，以便回到朝鲜后进行传达，更进一步提高朝鲜人民的胜利信心。
    洪淳哲盛赞中国人民志愿军在朝鲜人民中的崇高威信。他说：志愿军不仅在前方英勇无比地打击了敌人，极大地鼓舞了朝鲜军民的必胜信心，而且和朝鲜人民已经建立起亲如家人的深厚情谊。志愿军同志们英勇地抢救在敌机轰炸下的妇女儿童、粮食和财物，帮助驻地群众劳动，已成为常事。因此，朝鲜人民也像爱护自己的子弟一样爱护志愿军。他们自动地帮助志愿军运输、带路、缝洗衣服，很多朝鲜护士踊跃地给志愿军伤员输血。朝鲜人民已公认中国人民志愿军是一支爱国主义和国际主义结合的英勇善战的纪律严明的部队。
    副团长金朝奎也作了简短发言。
    会上，首都新闻工作者曾对朝鲜人民访华代表团和代表团中的朝鲜新闻工作者表示热烈的欢迎。会后，朝鲜的和首都的新闻工作同志又作了亲密的交谈。
