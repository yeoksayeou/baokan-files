Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: China People's Volunteer Army returning delegate Dong Lefu, after returning to the Korean front, wrote a letter to the China People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and the people of the motherland, reporting on the work situation at the front and the heroic fighting deeds of the Chinese and Korean soldiers.

In his letter, Dong Lefu said: After we returned to the Korean front, we went separately to the various units of the Volunteer Army and the People's Army to make reports, publicizing the victory of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in the motherland, the achievements of national defense construction and economic construction, and conveying the love, support, and hopes of the people of the whole country for the Volunteer Army and the People's Army. Our reports were also warmly welcomed as they were in the country. Every time we went to a unit, that unit would hold a welcome meeting, and the hero models and cadres and soldiers of the unit would send representatives to travel over mountains and ridges to participate. Gao Qujin, a platoon leader of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, traveled for a day and a night from the front line to listen to the report. He said to me, "Listening to the report of people from the motherland is like returning to the motherland itself." At each meeting, I reported for a total of three or four hours, but the listeners always felt it was not enough. At a welcome meeting of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, I reported for five and a half hours. At the end of the report, I thought that the comrades had come a long way from the front line to attend the meeting, and they had been sitting in the cold wind for more than five hours, which should be tiring enough, but who knew that they still wanted me to talk more. The soldiers on the front line care so much about everything in the motherland.

Dong Lefu continued: Those who participated in the meeting were all the most heroic comrades selected by the troops in battle; therefore, when I made reports in various troops, I also heard many rich and moving battle stories. Platoon Leader Gao Qujin, in a battle on a certain highland in the eastern part of the central front, led three combat teams to resist the attacks of enemy platoons and companies under the cover of more than 20 tanks and dense artillery fire. After three days and three nights of fierce fighting, he killed or wounded more than 140 enemies, shattered the enemy's offensive, and I only had five minor injuries and one death.

The first company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, guarding the 938.2 Highland on the eastern front, fought fiercely with the enemy for five days and four nights from 3:00 p.m. on October 15th, annihilating more than 1,800 enemies, creating a brilliant example of annihilating a large number of enemies in the blocking battle. On the first day, an enemy battalion repeatedly attacked a group of our second platoon eight times on the front line of the highland, all of which were repelled, and more than 120 enemies were killed or wounded. On the second day, from dawn to dusk, the enemy attacked us in three routes with an entire battalion, launching as many as twelve charges. Under the calm and heroic counterattack of our army, the enemy left more than 200 bodies in front of our position. On the third day, the enemy投入的兵力多到一个团,并有许多架飞机助战。Enemy officers drove his soldiers like sheep in more than a dozen routes to our positions like a flock of sheep. The battle was unprecedentedly fierce. The entire hilltop was filled with smoke, and the shouts of killing shook the valley. The enemies fell one after another, and many of our fortifications were also destroyed. The soldiers turned over from the soil, jumped into the craters, and continued to shoot at the enemy. Zhao Defu, the third platoon leader, was wounded in three places on his chest, face, and hands, with blood all over his face. He only opened one eye, but still insisted on commanding the troops. Zuo, a machine gun shooter of the fourth squad, had his left arm broken, and he used one hand to shoot at the enemy. On the fourth day of the battle, the battalion commander called to ask about the situation. Company Commander Gao Chengshan reported, "It doesn't matter. Although we have fewer people, our strength is not small at all. We must hold the position!" Our soldiers thus overcame the enemy with unparalleled heroism.

A commander of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army on the eastern section of the central front told me that from October 7th to the end of the month, the unit annihilated more than 8,000 enemies. Another unit annihilated a total of 12,135 enemies from October 16th to the end of November.

The Korean People's Army on the eastern front also achieved brilliant victories in the battle to smash the enemy's autumn offensive. A commander of the People's Army told me that the enemy suffered more than 3,000 casualties in front of the 1211 Highland, which was guarded by only one of their units. An enemy captured by the People's Army said, "We can go up to the 1211 Highland, but after going up, we either die or become prisoners." In mid-September, a certain unit of the People's Army guarded the 854.1 Highland and annihilated more than 5,000 of the Li puppet army.

Our report gave great encouragement to the Chinese and Korean soldiers. Everyone is determined to use greater victories to answer the love and hope of our people in the motherland. Zhao Fapan, a second-class meritorious citizen of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, said after listening to the report: "The people of the motherland have placed their hopes on us. We must use practical actions to repay the people of the motherland in the future." Cui Tianfang, a "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" of a certain unit of the People's Army, said: "After listening to the report, we further understand the great strength of our great neighbor—the Chinese people, and feel that our reserve strength is incomparably strong, which greatly improves our confidence in victory. We sincerely thank the Chinese people for their love and support for us."

    志愿军归国代表返回前线后写信给抗美援朝总会
    向祖国人民报告志愿军英勇战绩
    志愿军战士们热情地关怀祖国建设成就
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民志愿军归国代表董乐辅回到朝鲜前线后，写信给中国人民抗美援朝总会和祖国人民，报告在前线工作的情况和中朝战士英勇作战的事迹。
    董乐辅在信上说：我们回到朝鲜前线后，就分头向志愿军和人民军各部队作报告，宣传祖国抗美援朝运动的胜利，国防建设和经济建设的成就，以及传达全国人民对志愿军、人民军的热爱、支援和希望。我们的报告也像在国内一样受到热烈的欢迎。我们每到一个部队，那个部队就举行欢迎会，部队的英雄模范、干部战士都派代表翻山越岭赶来参加。志愿军某部排长高取金，从前沿阵地上赶了一天一夜的路来听报告。他对我说：“听了从祖国来的人的报告，就像自己回到了祖国一样。”每次会上，我作报告的时间总有三、四小时，但听的人总嫌不够。在志愿军某部的一个欢迎会上，我报告了五个半钟头，报告结束时，心里想同志们都是从前线阵地上赶了不少路来参加开会的，在冷风中坐了五个多钟头，该够累了，那知他们还要我再多讲一些。前线的战士们就是这样地关怀着祖国的一切。
    董乐辅接着说：参加开会的都是部队推选出来的在战斗中最英勇的同志；因而我在各个部队作报告时，也听到了许多丰富的动人的战斗故事。高取金排长在中线东部某高地上的一次战斗里，率领三个战斗小组，抗击着成排成连的敌人在二十多辆战车和密集炮火掩护下的进攻，经过三天三夜的激战，杀伤敌人一百四十多名，粉碎了敌人的攻势，我仅轻伤五人、牺牲一人。
    守卫在东线九三八点二高地的志愿军某部一连，从十月十五日下午三时起，和敌人激战五天四夜，歼敌一千八百多名，创造了阻击战中大量歼灭敌人的光辉范例。第一天，敌人一个营的兵力向高地前沿我二排一个组轮番进攻八次，都被击退，敌人被杀伤一百二十多名。第二天，从拂晓到黄昏，敌人又以整营的兵力分三路向我进攻，先后冲锋达十二次之多。在我军沉着英勇的反击下，敌人在我阵地面前遗尸二百多具。第三天敌人投入的兵力多到一个团，并有许多架飞机助战。敌人军官发了疯似地驱赶着他的士兵分十几路像赶羊群一样向我阵地蜂拥而来，战斗空前激烈。整个山头上硝烟弥漫，杀喊声震撼山谷。敌人一批一批地倒下去了，我们的工事也有许多被摧毁，战士们从泥土中翻身出来，跳到弹坑里，继续向敌人射击。三排长赵德福的胸、脸、手三处负伤，血流满面，只睁着一只眼睛，但仍坚持指挥部队。四班机枪射手左胳膊被打断，他用一只手射击敌人。战斗到第四天，营指挥员打电话来问情况，连长高成山报告说：“不要紧，我们的人虽然少了，但我们的力量一点也不小，阵地一定守住！”我们的战士就这样用无比的英雄气概战胜了敌人。
    中线东部志愿军某部指挥员告诉我，从十月七日到月底，该部歼灭敌人八千余名。另一支部队从十月十六日到十一月底，共歼灭敌人一万二千一百三十五名。
    东线朝鲜人民军在粉碎敌人秋季攻势的战斗中，也同样取得了辉煌的胜利。人民军某指挥员告诉我，仅在他们一个部队守卫的一二一一高地前，敌人就伤亡了三千多人。被人民军俘掳的敌人说：“一二一一高地我们可以上去，可是上去之后，不是死亡就是当俘虏。”在九月中旬，人民军某部守卫在八五四点一高地上，歼灭李伪军五千多人。
    我们的报告，给了中朝人民战士极大的鼓舞，大家都下定决心，用更大的胜利来回答我们祖国人民的热爱和希望。志愿军某部二等功臣赵发盘听了报告以后说：“祖国人民把希望寄托在我们身上，我们今后一定用实际表现来报答祖国人民。”人民军某部“朝鲜人民共和国英雄”崔天方说：“听了报告后，我们进一步了解了我们伟大的友邻——中国人民雄厚的力量，感到我们的后备力量强大无比，大大地提高了我们的胜利信心。我们衷心地感谢中国人民对我们的热爱和支援。”
