Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 19th: Our front-line reporter reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continue to repel small-scale enemy attacks in many areas along the entire front.

	On the 11th, an enemy battalion, under the cover of tanks, attacked a high ground near Mugwandong, northwest of Tieyuan. Three consecutive assaults were repelled by a certain unit of our army, resulting in dozens of enemy casualties. On the morning of the 12th, a company of the US 45th Division invaded our army's position in the Chengshan area west of Tieyuan, and was repelled by our intensive firepower, resulting in dozens of enemy casualties. On the same day, an enemy company on the eastern front invaded a high ground east of Shatali and positions in the Wuxianggou area, and retreated after suffering more than 50 casualties inflicted by our forces.

	In the area northeast of Panmunjom, the First Division of the Li Pseudo-Army, which had suffered more than 2,700 casualties in twelve consecutive days of attacks, continued to harass the area with two platoons on the 13th, and more than 30 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded by our army.

	It is particularly noteworthy that in the eastern front area, the enemy has been shelling our army's positions with artillery for days, and concentrating a large number of aircraft to indiscriminately bomb and strafe the peaceful residents of Korea. On the 13th, enemy aircraft dropped more than 100 bombs north of Mundung-ri. On the 15th, the enemy fired more than 8,000 shells at our army's positions in an area approximately 20 kilometers wide near Mundung-ri; and dispatched 88 aircraft to carry out frantic bombing and strafing of the area. Linking the above facts with the recent atrocities of American aircraft indiscriminately bombing Pyongyang and other places, it is clear that the American aggressors are systematically using threats and provocative actions to continue to delay and obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations.

    美国侵略者图用威胁和挑衅行动拖延朝鲜谈判
    朝中部队继续打退敌军的小规模进攻
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军继续打退敌军在全线许多地方的小规模进攻。
    十一日，敌军一个营在战车掩护下向铁原西北牧馆洞附近一个高地进攻，一连三次冲锋都被我军某部击退，敌伤亡数十人。十二日晨，美军第四十五师一个连进犯铁原以西城山地区我军阵地，被我密集火力击退，敌伤亡数十人。同日，东线敌军一个连向沙汰里以东一个高地和乌项谷一带阵地进犯，遭我杀伤五十多人后溃退。
    在板门店东北地区，在连续十二天的进攻中伤亡二千七百多人的李伪军第一师，十三日继以两个排兵力向该地窜扰，又被我军杀伤三十多人。
    特别值得注意的是，在东线地区敌军连日用大炮轰击我军阵地，并集中大量飞机滥施轰炸和扫射朝鲜的和平居民。十三日，敌机在文登里以北投弹一百多枚。十五日，敌军向文登里附近约二十公里宽的我军阵地发射了八千多发炮弹；并出动飞机八十八架，对该地区进行疯狂的轰炸与扫射。把上面的事实和最近美机滥炸平壤等暴行联系起来，显然可以看出，美国侵略者是在有计划地用威胁和挑衅行动来继续拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判。
