Xinhua News Agency, December 31st, Moscow Dispatch: According to TASS, on the eve of the New Year, Solovyov, head of the Soviet People's Observation Delegation, and Obalin, a member of the delegation, who participated in the celebrations of the National Day of the People's Republic of China this year, and Gerasimov, a famous Soviet director who participated in the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation to China two years ago, spoke to TASS reporters, extending New Year's greetings to the great Chinese people.

Solovyov, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, said: Visiting China and participating in the National Day celebrations of the People's Republic of China was the most pleasant event that impressed me this year. The Soviet people are very concerned about the life and work of the heroic Chinese people and are truly happy for their achievements. The working people of the Soviet Union and China not only enthusiastically support peace, but are also active fighters for peace and friendship between nations. We are jointly striving for peace through labor, which has greatly strengthened the forces of the world peace camp. I wish the Chinese working people new achievements in realizing the historical tasks set by Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people.

Obalin, Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, described his impressions of visiting new Chinese educational and research institutions, and pointed out the major achievements in Chinese biology and other fields. He said: What pleases me is that the Chinese scientific and educational circles have taken decisive steps in the past year to get rid of all the harmful effects left by the anti-people policies implemented by American and Japanese imperialism in China. Like Soviet scientists, Chinese scientists are contributing their creative efforts to the cause of peace. I wish Chinese scientists new victories in the struggle for peace and progress.

Gerasimov, a People's Artist of the Soviet Union, said: I will always remember the days when I co-directed the feature film "Liberated China" with Chinese film workers in New China. In the past period, the Soviet people have been eager to appreciate Chinese film art and have gradually developed a deep love for it. The films produced by the young Chinese film industry are very moving, with clear political content and realistic forms, and clearly demonstrate the universal progress of Chinese people's culture and the development of creative power. I wish all Chinese film workers further success in their creative endeavors.

    苏联索洛维耶夫、奥巴林、格拉西莫夫向我国人民贺年并祝我获得新胜利
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：曾在今年参加中华人民共和国国庆节庆祝典礼的苏联人民观礼代表团团长索洛维耶夫、团员奥巴林，和曾在前年参加苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团访问中国的苏联名导演格拉西莫夫，在新年前夕对塔斯社记者发表谈话，向伟大的中国人民祝贺新年。
    全苏工会中央理事会书记索洛维耶夫说：访问中国和参加中华人民共和国国庆节庆典，是一年中给我留下最愉快的印象的事件。苏联人民十分关怀英雄的中国人民的生活和工作，并且对他们的成就感到真正的高兴。苏中两国的劳动人民不但热情地拥护和平，而且还是争取和平和各民族间友谊的积极战士。我们共同以劳动来争取和平，这种劳动已大大地增强了世界和平阵营的力量。谨祝中国劳动人民在实现中国人民领袖毛泽东同志规定的历史任务中获得新的成就。
    苏联科学院院士奥巴林叙述了他参观新中国教育和研究机关的印象，并指出了中国生物学等方面的重大成就。他说：使我高兴的是中国科学和教育界一年来已采取了决定性的步骤，来摆脱美、日帝国主义在中国实行的反人民的政策所留下的一切有害影响。中国科学家和苏联科学家一样以创造性的努力贡献给和平事业。祝中国科学家在争取和平和进步的斗争中获得新的胜利。
    苏联人民艺术家格拉西莫夫说：我永远记得我在新中国和中国电影工作者共同导演艺术片“解放了的中国”的日子。在过去一个时期中，苏联人民都争先恐后地欣赏中国的电影艺术，并逐渐对它有深切的爱好。年轻的中国电影事业所出产的电影都是很动人的，它们具有鲜明的政治内容和现实主义的形式，而且明白地表明了中国人民文化的普遍进步和创造力量的发展。谨祝中国全体电影工作者在他们的创造性努力中获得进一步的成功。
