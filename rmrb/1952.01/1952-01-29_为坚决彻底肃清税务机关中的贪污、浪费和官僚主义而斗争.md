Struggle to Thoroughly Eliminate Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy in Tax Authorities
Li Yu'ang, Director of the State Taxation Bureau of the Central Ministry of Finance

    Tax Authorities Should Be a Key Focus for Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy

    Launching an anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in tax authorities is of particular importance. This is because tax authorities are distributed throughout the country, with a large number of staff who interact with a broad range of taxpayers – businesses – every day, and who handle money. If someone's position is even slightly unstable, they will be tempted by the surrounding negative influences, accepting bribes and engaging in corruption. This will inevitably lead to a corrupt lifestyle and the protection of smuggling. As a result, it will cause losses in national tax revenue, hinder the progress of the Resist America, Aid Korea and national construction efforts, and ruin the future of these individuals.

    Since the founding of New China, people's tax work has achieved considerable success in terms of establishing laws and regulations, formulating systems, setting up institutions, assigning cadres, and completing tasks. The increase in tax personnel has been even more rapid. The newly added components are quite complex, and after being recruited, most of them were sent to work without being trained and assessed. It should be pointed out that over the past two years, most of the new employees have been willing to make progress, and some have indeed made progress. However, it should also be pointed out that over the past two years, tax authorities in various regions have conducted anti-corruption struggles more than once, and the number of corrupt elements is alarming. There exists in our tax workforce a group (a considerable group) of hidden, shameful corrupt elements who, to satisfy their personal gain, do not hesitate to harm the interests of the state. Among them are some veteran cadres who have failed to withstand the test and have become degenerate and transformed by the erosion of bourgeois decadent ideology. This is a very serious phenomenon. This is the result of our people's tax staff being eroded and fiercely attacked by bourgeois ideology.

    As for the phenomenon of waste in tax authorities, it is also very serious. For example, the printing of receipts and forms, due to lack of experience and inaccurate estimations, has led to blind printing and a large backlog of inventory. In some areas, the receipts and forms printed are enough for a year, in some areas tax bills could last for ten years, and some are even discarded without being used. Cases of loss and theft occur constantly in various regions. Most of these are caused by a lack of responsibility for state property. Lavish spending on banquets, gifts, and conferences is also very serious. In terms of personal life, leading cadres at all levels of tax authorities, especially at higher levels, have become complacent, extravagant, and wasteful, which is no longer an isolated phenomenon. Those below follow the example of those above, pursuing enjoyment, and many people are affected. Some cadres with weak willpower have thus lost their footing and further fallen into the abyss of corruption.

    The most prevalent bureaucratic phenomenon in tax authorities, in addition to the commandism criticized in 1950, is the lack of a mass perspective. This manifests in complicated procedures and slow processing, often causing taxpayers to wait for many days just to fill out a tax bill, consuming ships, trucks of goods, transportation tools, and manpower in the process of waiting for tax procedures to be completed (of course, tax certificates are still needed). This irresponsible bureaucracy that does not care about the interests of the masses is relatively widespread among tax personnel.

    Secondly, many responsible comrades in tax bureaus are trapped in the circle of red tape, spending most of their time sitting indoors approving official documents, but turning a deaf ear to the waves stirred up by corrupt elements below. Bureaucrats slowly waste time and delay taxpayers' operations, yet they are not ashamed of it.

    Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for tax authorities at all levels across the country, under the unified leadership of party and government organs at all levels, to conduct a vigorous, swift, resolute, and merciless struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Eradicating and eliminating the shameful toxins left over from the old era in the people's tax authorities and personnel is the central political task at present. No comrade can be allowed to stand outside the movement; all tax personnel must guarantee that the movement will be carried out to victory.

    Combining Internal and External Efforts Is the Most Effective Way to Carry Out the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Struggle

    According to the analysis of existing materials, most of the corruption of tax personnel is inseparable from the bribery and enticement of merchants. Therefore, generally speaking, there is less corruption among internal staff and the most corruption among field staff. This determines that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in tax authorities must be combined with the vigorous anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-fraud struggle in the business community.

    Special attention should be paid to education and enlightenment work to break the "alliance of offense and defense" between bribers and bribe-takers; to break the various concerns about speaking out about those who accept and offer bribes; and to encourage those who are enlightened first to bravely take the lead in confessing and reporting. The recent confessions and self-criticisms of Zhu Jisheng, Bi Mingqi, Yang Jian'an and other responsible persons in the Tianjin business community are good. But are they the only ones? Is it just Tianjin? Absolutely not. In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, the vast number of shop assistants in Tianjin reported 11,087 cases of bribery, tax evasion, and embezzlement of state assets in six days. Mr. Sheng Pihua, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, pointed out that the severity of bribery, fraud, tax evasion, and the pursuit of exorbitant profits in Shanghai's business community may exceed that of Beijing and Tianjin. The recent investigation of Shanghai Minfeng and Huafeng Paper Companies, which evaded taxes of 11.822 billion yuan, proves that the estimation is not wrong. We hope to quickly capture this largest fortress in the country. This is a toxin left over from history and is also determined by the nature of the bourgeoisie. They are profit-seeking and, as long as it benefits them personally, they dare to do all kinds of bad things that harm others and the state, such as illegal activities, tax evasion, bribery, and fraud. This is something we must be highly vigilant about.

    In the first half of 1951, there were more than 570,000 tax evasion cases across the country. What an alarming figure! For example, when Tianjin investigated tax sources last year, more than 36,000 of the city's 58,000 industrial and commercial households were required to pay supplementary taxes, accounting for 62% of the total number of households, which shows the high proportion of tax evaders. This situation is no exception in cities across the country. We have made calculations and believe that the estimate that tax evasion accounts for 20% to 25% of the taxes already paid is by no means an exaggeration. Therefore, we ask the business community across the country to earnestly participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. Those business operators who have evaded taxes from the time of liberation to the end of 1951 must thoroughly explain the situation to the tax bureau. Those who do so voluntarily may pay supplementary taxes without penalty; those who are reported by others or discovered later will definitely be penalized and severely punished without leniency. It must be understood that paying supplementary taxes without penalty is a lenient treatment by the government for those who confess; however, the government will still investigate the issue of tax evasion, bribery, and fraud at any time, even if the confession is not thorough.

    Under the New Democratic regime, the business community is allowed to obtain legitimate profits, but shameful crimes such as bribery, tax evasion, and fraud are never allowed to continue to exist. Those in the tax authorities who have confessed but the bribing merchants have not confessed must be investigated; those merchants who have confessed but the tax authorities have not confessed must be dealt with. From the inside out, from the outside in, tracing back to the root, until it is completely cleaned up.

    It must be pointed out that the leading comrades of tax authorities in some cities are satisfied with "completing the task" and are paralyzed and negligent regarding the serious tax evasion phenomenon in the business community; they even fear harming the enthusiasm of industry and commerce and are unwilling to thoroughly investigate tax sources and check for evasion. This is serious bureaucracy. If they cannot promptly correct this and deeply transform their work in this great campaign, then the root causes of corruption, bribery, tax evasion, and bureaucracy will inevitably not be eliminated, which will cause continued losses in national tax revenue, and they will commit even greater mistakes. For example, after visiting Tianjin, Shanghai, and other cities, the Chongqing business community shouted that Chongqing's taxes were too heavy; however, after a joint sample survey of 817 industrial and commercial enterprises by the business community and the tax bureau, it was found that 535 of them were evading taxes, while there were no businesses that were taxed above the tax rate. This shows that it is not that Chongqing's taxes are too heavy, but that some cities are collecting less tax. Therefore, we ask leading comrades and all working comrades of tax authorities at all levels to face this fact squarely.

    This anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign is being carried out in conjunction with the business community's anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-fraud struggle. Therefore, the development of the movement is a pincer attack from both inside and outside, which is swift and fierce. The experience of the tax authorities in Beijing and Tianjin in carrying out this work is:

    First, it is necessary to implement the principle that "the fortress is most easily broken from within," and widely mobilize employees, shop assistants, and accountants to report the illegal acts of corruption and tax evasion by some tax personnel and illegal merchants. In this movement, some corrupt elements in the tax personnel and illegal merchants have formed an "alliance of offense and defense," attempting to undermine the movement. However, the vast number of employees, shop assistants, and accountants are most aware of their various criminal acts. In this movement in Beijing and Tianjin, great achievements have been made due to the widespread mobilization of employees, shop assistants, and accountants to report. In six days, the shop assistants in Tianjin reported more than 10,000 facts of corruption, bribery, and tax evasion, which is the most powerful proof of this.

    In the current anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement, I would like to express a sincere hope to the leading comrades of trade unions and grassroots trade unions in all parts of the country, please join with the local tax authorities to call on all industrial and commercial employees, shop assistants and accountants to conduct a universal, serious and courageous movement to report bribery and tax evasion, and help industry and commerce and tax authorities to thoroughly and deeply carry out this movement and continue it to victory. This is an extremely important task.

    Secondly, tax personnel must undergo a major cleansing (registering the business names or merchants with whom they have had relationships and dealings). This is because the corruption of some tax cadres and the tax evasion of illegal merchants are often carried out in collusion, working together from the inside and outside; breaking through one point will also promote the overall situation. Within the tax authorities, first mobilize tax personnel to confess and report, calling for them to atone for their crimes. The confession of corrupt acts by tax personnel also exposes the facts of bribery and tax evasion by illegal merchants. On the other hand, the confession and reporting by enlightened industrialists and businessmen also exposes the corruption of tax personnel. In this way, combined with the reporting of employees and shop assistants, it is not difficult to find out everything about the cases.

    Third, the tax authorities must participate in leading the confession and reporting work of the business community, and the responsible comrades must go to the front line in person, and cannot let things drift. Some illegal merchants, under strong pressure and education, know that they cannot get away with it and cannot hide it, so they confess to acts of bribery and tax evasion. For example, Li Zhouhang, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Taxation Bureau, participated in leading the mobilization meeting for confession and reporting convened by the business community. At the meeting, 252 people signed up, willing to vigorously promote the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement; 121 people signed up to confess their own or report others' bribery, corruption, and other acts.

    Fourth, systematically implement employee and shop assistant supervision of production and commodity sales, and break the traditional so-called "commercial secrets." Some illegal merchants often use so-called "commercial secrets" to prevent employees and shop assistants from improving business suggestions, and use this to deceive the tax authorities and engage in tax evasion and other illegal acts, causing huge losses to national tax revenue. In this movement, the tax authorities must cooperate with employees and shop assistants to strengthen external inspections and crack down on all illegal acts that use so-called "commercial secrets" to evade taxes.

    Only by Carrying Out the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement to the End Can Tax Work Make Great Strides Forward

    After summarizing its experience, the Third National Tax Conference in April 1951 stipulated four work guidelines: "(1) Study the economy and understand the tax base; (2) Handle affairs according to law and calculate and collect taxes according to rates; (3) Strengthen the organization and improve cadres; (4) Collect all taxes in full and complete the task." Over the past year, some achievements have been made in these areas, but it must be pointed out that due to the existence of corruption, waste, and serious bureaucracy in our tax workforce, it is absolutely impossible to fully achieve the goals required by these four work guidelines. The reason is very clear: corrupt elements are unwilling to tell the organization about the true tax base, and bureaucrats will not conduct in-depth investigations and research, so naturally they cannot understand the true tax base. As long as corrupt elements and bureaucrats exist, there is no talk of handling affairs according to law, nor is there any talk of calculating and collecting taxes according to rates. With corrupt elements, waste, and bureaucrats in our ranks, what is there to say about "strengthening the organization and improving cadres"? In general, before corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are eliminated, there is no talk of "collecting all taxes in full and completing the task."

    Chairman Mao called on all the people and all staff in our country to unite and vigorously and swiftly launch a large-scale struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and wash away these toxins left over from the old society. It must be recognized that this movement is a movement of the same important political significance as the Resist America, Aid Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries. All comrades in the tax authorities, especially the leading comrades, should immediately take action, deeply examine themselves and their surroundings in a spirit of combat, vigorously mobilize the masses, organize internal and external forces, and deeply carry out this movement; every tax worker must be required to provide a guarantee that they will dig out the roots of bourgeois ideology in their minds, draw a clear line, and recognize all the ugly acts of the bourgeoisie and give them a powerful counterattack.

    In this great movement, all tax personnel should unanimously recognize that: "Anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy is essentially a struggle against bourgeois corrupt ideology, that is, a resolute counterattack against the rampant attack launched by the bourgeoisie against the working class and the Chinese Communist Party in the past three years, to suppress this reactionary attack, and to give the bourgeoisie's reactionary ugly thoughts and behaviors political transformation and legal sanctions. Only in this way can the victory of the revolution be guaranteed. This is a serious class struggle, and we must win in this struggle."

    为坚决彻底肃清税务机关中的贪污、浪费和官僚主义而斗争
    中央财政部税务总局局长　李予昂
    税务机关应该是反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的重点之一
    在税务机关中开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，具有特殊重要的意义。因为，税务机关分布全国，工作人员众多，每日每时都和广大的纳税人——工商界往来，并接触着钱财；如果有人立场稍有不稳，便会接受周围恶劣思想的引诱，受贿、贪污之后，势必生活腐化，包庇走私；其结果就要造成国家税收的损失，妨害抗美援朝与国家建设事业的进展，并葬送了这些人自己的前途。
    新中国成立以来，人民税务工作，不论从创立法规、订定制度、建立机构、配备干部及完成任务等方面来说，都有相当的成绩。税务人员的增加，更为迅速。新增加的成分相当复杂，而且在录用之后，大部没有来得及进行训练和考察，即被派到工作岗位去了。应该指出，两年多来，大多数新参加工作的人员是愿意进步的，而且确有好些人是进步了。但是更应该指出，两年多来，各地区的税务机关，曾不止一次地进行了反贪污斗争，贪污分子数目之多是惊人的。我们的税务工作队伍中，存在着一批（不少的一批）隐蔽的可耻的为满足私利不惜损害国家利益的贪污分子；其中还有一些是经不起考验，受了资产阶级腐朽思想侵蚀而堕落蜕化的老干部。这是十分严重的现象。这是我们人民税务工作人员，被资产阶级思想侵蚀和猖狂进攻的结果。
    至于税务机关的浪费现象，亦是很严重的。如印制票照、表格，由于经验不足，估计不实，盲目印制，积压数量是很大的；有些地方的票照、表格，可用一年不需再印，有些地区的税票，可用十年，有的甚至没有使用就作废了。遗失盗窃情事，各区不断发生。其中大多数都是对国家财产不负责任所致。请客送礼和会议的铺张浪费也是很严重的。个人生活方面，各级税务机关，特别是较高级的税务机关的领导干部，居功自满，铺张浪费，已不是个别现象。上行下效，追逐享受，有不少的人受了影响；某些意志不坚定的干部，因此而失足，进一步堕入贪污的深渊。
    税务机关存在的最普遍的官僚主义现象，除一九五○年所批判过的命令主义之外，就是缺乏群众观点，表现在手续繁、办事慢，常常使纳税人因填一张税票等候好多天，使成船成车的货物、运输工具、人力消耗在等待纳税手续的过程中（当然纳税证件还是需要的），这种不负责任、不关心群众利益的官僚主义，在税务工作人员中是比较普遍地存在着的。
    其次，税局很有一些负责同志，陷在文牍主义的圈子内，以大部时间坐在屋内批办公文，对下边贪污分子的兴风作浪，却充耳不闻；官僚主义者在慢吞吞地消磨时间，耽误纳税人的经营，反恬不为怪。
    因此，全国各级税务机关，在各级党政机关统一领导下，进行一次大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地、坚决地、无情地反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，是万分必要的。把旧时代遗留在人民税务机关和人员当中的可耻的污毒，予以根绝和肃清，这是目前的中心政治任务。决不能容许有一个同志站在运动之外；全体税务工作人员，必须保证将运动进行到胜利。
    内外结合是进行反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争最有效的办法
    根据现有材料分析，税务人员的贪污，大部分是和商人的行贿拉拢分不开的。因此，一般地说，内勤人员贪污较少，外勤人员贪污最多。这就决定了税务机关开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，必须和轰轰烈烈的工商界的反行贿、反偷税、反诈欺斗争结合进行。
    要特别注意教育启发工作，打破行贿人和受贿人的“攻守同盟”；要打破怕说出受贿、行贿者的各种顾虑；要鼓励先觉悟的人，勇敢带头坦白、检举。最近天津市工商界负责人士朱继圣、毕鸣岐、杨健庵等带头坦白检讨是好的。但是否就是他们几位呢？是否仅是天津一市呢？绝对不是的。天津市广大店员在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中，六天里就检举行贿、偷税、诈骗国家资产案件一万一千零八十七件。上海市工商业联合会主任委员盛丕华先生指出：上海市工商界的行贿欺诈、偷税漏税、追求暴利的严重程度，可能超过北京和天津。最近查获的上海民丰、华丰两造纸公司，逃税即达一百十八亿二千二百余万元，可以证明估计不差。我们希望迅速攻开全国这个最大的堡垒。这是历史上遗留下来的污毒，也是资产阶级本质所规定了的。他们唯利是图，只要对个人有利益，一切损害别人、损害国家的违法、逃税、行贿、诈欺等坏事都敢干出来。这是我们必须高度警惕的。
    一九五一年上半年全国偷税案件达五十七万余件，这是何等惊人的数字！再如天津市去年调查税源时，全市五万八千户的工商业中，补税三万六千余户，占总户数百分之六十二，可以看出逃税户的比重之大。这种情况，全国各城市无一例外。我们曾作过推算，认为全国逃税漏税占已纳税款百分之二十到百分之二十五的估计，是决不夸大的。因此，我们要求全国工商界认真参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。从解放以来至一九五一年底，凡偷漏了税款的业户，要干净彻底地向税局交代清楚，自动办理者可以补税不罚；被人检举或以后查出者，必定加倍处罚，从重处罚，决不宽贷。必须明白，补税不罚是政府对坦白者的宽大处理；但是，政府对坦白不彻底的逃税问题、行贿问题、诈欺问题，任何时候发觉，一定还要追究。
    在新民主主义政权下，工商界获得合法利润是允许的，但是，决不允许行贿、逃税、诈欺等可耻的罪恶行为继续存在。凡是税务机关人员已坦白而行贿商人不坦白者，必须追究商人；商人已坦白而税务人员不坦白者，必须处办税务人员。由内及外，由外及内，从根追起，不净不止。
    必须指出，某些城市税务机关的领导同志，满足于“完成任务”，对工商界的严重偷漏现象，麻痹忽视；甚至因害怕伤害工商业的积极性而不愿将调查税源和检查偷漏的工作办得彻底。这是严重的官僚主义。如果在这次巨大的运动中，不能急起纠正，深入转变工作，则贪污、行贿、偷漏和官僚主义病根必然不能肃清，将使国家税收继续遭受损失，自己亦将要犯更大的错误。举例来说，重庆市工商界参观天津、上海等城市归去之后，大喊重庆市税重了；但是经过工商界和税局共同对八一七户工商业典型抽查的结果，其中偷税漏税的有五百三十五户，而超过税率征收的业户则是绝无仅有的。这就说明了并不是重庆市税重了，而是有些城市的税少收了。因此，要求各级税务机关领导同志和全体工作同志，一致正视这一事实。
    这一次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，是和工商界的反行贿、反偷税、反欺诈斗争结合起来进行的。所以，运动的发展是内外夹攻，迅猛异常。北京、天津两市税务机关进行这一工作的经验是：
    首先，必须贯彻“堡垒最容易从内部攻破”的方针，广泛地发动职工店员和会计人员，检举部分税务人员和不法商人的贪污、偷税的非法行为。在这一运动中，不少税务人员中的贪污分子和不法商人订立了“攻守同盟”，妄图破坏运动。但是，他们的各种罪恶行为，广大的职工店员和会计人员是最了解的。北京、天津在这次运动中，由于广泛地发动了职工店员和会计人员检举，已经获得极大的成绩。天津市店员在六天中，即检举了一万多件贪污、行贿、偷税的事实，这一事实，最有力地证明了这一点。
    在目前的反贪污、反行贿运动中，我愿向全国各地店员工会基层工会的领导同志提出一个热诚的希望，请你们和当地税务机关共同号召所有工商业的职工店员和会计人员，进行一次普遍地认真地勇敢地检举行贿、偷税运动，帮助工商业和税务机关把这一运动彻底、深入地开展起来，一直进行到胜利。这是一件极端重要的任务。
    其次，必须对税务工作人员进行一次大洗澡（登记和本人有过关系和有过往来的商号或商人）。因为部分税务干部的贪污和不法商人的偷税，往往是互相勾结，里应外合进行的；突破了一点，也就推动了全面。在税务机关内部，首先发动税务人员坦白检举，号召立功赎罪。税务人员坦白了贪污的行为，同时也就暴露了不法商人行贿、偷税的事实。另一面，先觉悟的工商业者的坦白检举，也就揭发了税务人员的贪污行为。这样内外结合，加上职工店员的检举，就不难把一切案件弄得水落石出。
    第三，税务机关必须参加领导工商界的坦白检举工作，负责同志亲自上前线，不能放任自流。一些不法商人在强大的压力和教育下，自知混不过去，欺瞒不住因而交代行贿、偷税等行为的，也不在少数。如天津市税务局李周行局长参加领导了工商界召开的坦白检举动员大会，会上就有二百五十二人报名，愿意大力推动反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动；有一百二十一人报名，要坦白自己或检举别人的行贿、受贿等行为。
    第四，有计划地实行职工店员对生产和商品买卖的监督，击破传统的所谓“商业秘密”。一些不法商人往往利用所谓“商业秘密”，阻止职工店员改善经营的建议，并以此来蒙蔽税务机关，进行偷税等不法行为，使国家税收造成巨大损失。在这次运动中，税务机关必须配合职工店员，加强对外检查，击破一切利用所谓“商业秘密”来进行偷税的不法行为。
    只有把反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动进行到底，税务工作才能大步前进
    一九五一年四月，第三届全国税务会议总结经验之后，曾规定四条工作方针：“（一）研究经济，摸清税源；（二）依法办事，依率计征；（三）加强组织，提高干部；（四）十足收齐，完成任务。”一年以来，在这些方面是获得了一些成绩的，但必须指出，由于我们税务工作队伍中有贪污、浪费和严重的官僚主义现象存在，就绝对不可能完满地达到这四条工作方针所要求的目的。道理是很明白的，贪污分子是不肯将真实税源告诉组织的，官僚主义者是不会深入调查与研究的，自然也摸不清真正税源。贪污分子、官僚主义分子存在一天，就谈不到依法办事，也谈不到依率计征。有贪污、浪费、官僚主义者存在我们的队伍中，还说什么“加强组织和提高干部”呢？总起来说，贪污、浪费、官僚主义没有肃清之前，也就谈不到“十足收齐、完成任务”了。
    毛主席号召我国全体人民和一切工作人员团结起来，大张旗鼓地，雷厉风行地，开展一个大规模的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争，将这些旧社会遗留下来的污毒洗干净。必须认识，这一次运动，是和抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命有同样重要政治意义的运动。所有税务机关的同志，特别是领导同志，应该立即行动起来，以战斗的精神深刻检查自己、检查周围、大力发动群众，组织内外力量，深入开展这一运动；必须要求每一个税务工作人员提出保证，要在思想里挖去资产阶级思想的根子，划清界限，并要认清资产阶级的一切丑恶行为，给以有力的反击。
    在这一次伟大的运动中，全体税务工作人员，应该一致认识：“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义，本质上就是反对资产阶级腐化思想的斗争，也就是对于资产阶级在三年以来向着工人阶级和中国共产党所举行的猖狂进攻，来一个坚决的反攻，把这种反动的进攻压下去，并把资产阶级的这种反动的丑恶的思想和行为给以政治上的改造和法律上的制裁。只有这样，革命胜利才能有保证。这是一场严重的阶级斗争，我们必须在这场斗争中取得胜利。”
