    The Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic League held a meeting last month and adopted the "Instructions on Launching the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy, Oppose Corruption, Oppose Waste, and Oppose Bureaucracy." The instructions made the following specific provisions for carrying out this movement:
    "1. All levels of organizations should establish committees for the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement (the name will be determined according to local conditions), closely cooperate with local governments, various democratic parties, and mass organizations to promote the movement to increase production and practice economy, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy, widely publicize it, and mobilize members to actively participate. At the same time, all levels of organizations should conduct internal inspections (inspecting the understanding of this movement, inspecting whether there are any acts of corruption, waste, or bureaucracy, and inspecting work efficiency), and based on the results of the inspection, formulate plans to improve work, increase work efficiency, and prevent corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.
    2. The district branches or groups in institutions (government, schools, enterprises, and other departments) must, under the unified leadership of the administration and in close cooperation with various democratic parties, actively assist the administration in promoting the movement to increase production and practice economy, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy, and must mobilize members to actively participate in inspection work, unreservedly exposing and denouncing acts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. At the same time, mobilize members to take the lead in self-examination, examining their own thoughts, behaviors, and work, and should sincerely help comrades inside and outside the League who work together to conduct self-examination.
    3. All levels of organizations should call on members to promote the masses they can connect with in their respective work positions to actively participate in the formulation of plans to increase production and practice economy, and should guarantee and promote the masses they connect with to work hard to achieve the plan; they must improve their work efficiency in their daily work. Comrades in leadership positions in institutions should pay more attention to overcoming bureaucracy and take the lead in launching criticism and self-criticism.
    4. All levels of organizations should conduct timely inspections on members' participation in the movement to increase production and practice economy, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy, commend those who actively participate, and criticize those who do not participate enthusiastically.
    5. All levels of organizations should, at an appropriate time, summarize the experiences, understandings, and problems in promoting the movement from bottom to top, and report them to the higher-level organization and report to the headquarters."

    民主同盟中央常务委员会指示各级组织
    为开展增产节约反贪污浪费运动而斗争
    中国民主同盟中央常务委员会上月曾举行会议，通过“关于开展增产节约反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动的指示”。该指示对开展这一运动作出了下列具体规定：
    “一、各级组织应成立增产节约运动委员会（名称根据地方情况决定之），与地方政府，和各民主党派，各群众团体密切配合，推动增产节约、反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，广泛宣传，发动盟员积极参加。各级组织，亦应同时进行内部检查（检查对于这一运动的认识，检查有无贪污、浪费、官僚主义的行为，检查工作效率），并根据检查结果，拟定改进工作、提高工作效率的计划和防止贪污、浪费、官僚主义的办法。
    二、在机关中（政府、学校、事业、企业等部门）的区分部或小组，必须在行政的统一领导下，和各民主党派密切配合，积极协助行政上推动增产节约、反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，并须发动盟员积极参加检查工作，毫无保留地检举揭发贪污、浪费和官僚主义的行为。同时发动盟员首先带头进行自我检查，检查自己的思想、行为和工作，并应热诚地帮助共同工作的盟内外同志们进行自我检查。
    三、各级组织应号召盟员各就其工作岗位推动其所能联系的群众，积极参加制订增产节约计划，并应保证和推动其所联系的群众，为实现计划而努力；在日常工作中必须提高自己的工作效率。在机关中负领导责任的同志，更应注意克服官僚主义，首先带头展开批评与自我批评。
    四、各级组织，对于盟员参加增产节约、反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，需要随时检查，对积极参加者予以表扬，对不热心参加者予以批评。
    五、各级组织应于适当时期，需要自下而上地将推进运动的经验、体会与问题作成总结，报告上级组织，汇报总部。”
