Clearing Assets and Verifying Funds is an Important Part of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
Fan Yiping

State-owned enterprises are the most important link in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. To achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy, it is necessary to carefully clear assets and strictly verify funds.

The Basic Situation of Clearing Assets and Verifying Funds in National State-Owned Enterprises

The work of clearing assets and verifying funds in state-owned enterprises is generally carried out in five stages. These five stages are: inventory registration, appraisal and valuation, formulation of quotas, preparation of plans, and verification of funds. The work of various departments and regions is not very balanced in terms of development and progress. A large number of enterprises have basically completed or are close to completing the work of clearing, reviewing, registering, appraising, and valuing assets, and are in the process of formulating quotas, preparing plans, studying the use of funds, and preparing for verifying working capital; a few units have initially verified the funds; some enterprise units have completed the work of clearing assets and are in the process of valuation; and a few departments have prepared for inventory of assets, or have started typical experiments to promote the overall work.

The experience of this stage of work proves that enterprise units that attach importance to and grasp this work have made significant achievements. The main manifestations are: First, various units have exposed serious phenomena of fund backlog and waste, cleared out a large number of off-book materials, and overcome the chaotic phenomena of having accounts without goods and having goods without accounts. For example, the Huainan Mining Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department found off-book materials worth 10.15 billion yuan; the off-book materials of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration were worth 19.5 billion yuan; and the off-book materials of Factory 101 under the Industrial Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee were estimated to reach about 10,000 tons if all were cleared out. A large number of usable materials were also cleared out of "waste products." For example, the State-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory picked out a 1,000 kW generator from the waste materials. The phenomenon of backlog of materials is also very serious. The State-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory has a backlog of steel rings that can be used by the factory for 152 years; before the asset clearing of various state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai, inspections revealed waste totaling 150 billion yuan. Such situations were very common before the clearing of assets and verification of funds in state-owned enterprises. Second, through the clearing of assets and verification of funds, the leading cadres of many enterprises have basically gone from being ignorant to being knowledgeable, recognizing that the past problem was not insufficient funds, but slow capital turnover; criticizing the attitude of not paying attention to production management and financial management, and recognizing the conservatism of allowing a wide margin for error, preparing for emergencies, not calculating costs, and the harm of departmentalism to the overall interests of the country and enterprise management. Third, some factories and mines have begun to establish relatively complete systems in the process of clearing assets, such as asset management systems and raw material testing systems, consolidating the results of the inventory. Fourth, the political awareness of the workers and masses has been further improved in most factories and mines in this work; and on this basis, the enterprise production has been further advanced. Some units have held anti-waste exhibitions and launched ideological struggles against waste, making all employees consciously establish the concept of cherishing state property.

However, there are also many shortcomings in the process of clearing assets and verifying funds. For example, a cadre in a fine spinning workshop of the State-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory hoarded 4,000 spindles during the asset clearing, planning to use this batch of off-book materials to "reduce costs" after independent operation next year. The leading cadres of the Dongjiao Brewery of the Beijing Monopoly Company did not earnestly mobilize the masses during the asset clearing and verification of funds, believing that the workers were backward and uneducated, so they did not allow the workers to participate in the asset clearing and verification of funds. The workers also believed that this was a matter for the administrative side and had nothing to do with them. For example, the leading cadres of a factory in the Southwest region believed that the clearing had been completed and were unwilling to conduct a review; after inspection by the higher authorities, tens of thousands of tons of materials were cleared out again. Some units also did not establish systems at the same time during the asset clearing, resulting in "chaos after clearing" and "chaos as you clear," causing rework and unnecessary waste. There are also individual high-level leading organs that have not yet issued the decision and methods for clearing assets and verifying funds in state-owned enterprises to their subordinate departments. In short, there are still some enterprise leading cadres who do not attach importance to the work of clearing assets and verifying funds; this needs to be corrected urgently.

Without Clearing Assets and Verifying Funds, the Goal of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy Cannot be Achieved

A large-scale campaign to increase production and practice economy is now being launched throughout the country. Some enterprise leading cadres believe that assets should be cleared and funds verified first, and then production should be increased and economy practiced; others believe that since increasing production and practicing economy is the current central political task, they do not earnestly clear assets and strictly verify funds; both of these views are incorrect.

To transform a backward agricultural country into a strong industrial country, a large amount of funds is needed. Increasing production and practicing economy is the basic source of national capital accumulation; saving funds is an important part of increasing production and practicing economy. To save funds, it is first necessary to verify funds, thereby strengthening capital management, so as to use funds most effectively and rationally.

Clearing assets and verifying funds can save a lot of working capital. At present, the backlog and waste of funds in state-owned enterprises is a common phenomenon and a serious problem. From the asset clearing of some enterprises, it has been proven that the past funds of enterprises were surplus rather than insufficient. For example, after clearing assets and verifying funds, the Huainan Mining Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department initially decided to hand over materials totaling 21.9 billion yuan; the North China Textile Administration cleared out stagnant materials, overstocked materials, and working capital to be handed over, totaling 200 billion yuan; after the Central Railway Department implemented the economic accounting system after clearing assets and verifying funds, it planned to hand over materials with a total value of 4 trillion yuan to the state. The total number of working capital saved after the verification of funds in national state-owned enterprises will be a considerable amount. Therefore, verifying funds is the most important link for enterprises to increase production and practice economy.

Correctly verifying funds is the only way to correctly formulate a plan to increase production and practice economy. At present, some state-owned enterprises have reviewed the use of working capital in 1951 and the actual implementation of consumption quotas during the asset clearing and verification of funds, and then formulated a plan to increase production and practice economy based on the control figures for 1952. The Central Trade Department plans to save 25% of commodity circulation expenses in 1952. The units under the Industrial Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee plan to increase production by 8% and reduce costs by 10% in 1952.

Grasp the Main Links and Thoroughly Complete the Work of Clearing Assets and Verifying Funds

In order to carry out the work of verifying funds in a guided and step-by-step manner in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, all state-owned enterprises should grasp several key points.

In the process of clearing assets and verifying funds, several basic systems should be established; otherwise, there will be chaos while clearing, resulting in the phenomenon of new backlog of funds. These systems should include asset management systems, independent accounting systems and financial systems, contract systems, reward systems, and construction procedures for basic construction. When formulating these systems, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to discuss. Only the systems established through the discussion of the workers and masses can the workers consciously abide by.

Determining advanced economic quotas is the prerequisite for establishing working capital indicators. The organization of working capital is determined based on the nature of the enterprise's production and the actual required raw materials, fuels, auxiliary materials, spare parts, low-value consumables, work-in-progress, products, prepaid expenses, and inventory cash. To establish working capital indicators, all technical personnel, financial personnel, management personnel, and sales personnel of the enterprise must jointly study the enterprise's supply and sales situation and formulate a working capital use plan. The provisions of working capital quotas should be very specific and practical, and should be coordinated with the enterprise's supply situation, raw material reserve quotas, and consumption quotas, and cannot be estimated hastily. The determination of working capital quota indicators should adapt to the changes in the production process and production scale; and should consider the further improvement of labor efficiency. The determination of working capital quotas must be based on advanced standards, not on conservative and backward standards. In the process of saving working capital, ideological struggles should be carried out for saving raw materials, materials, fuels, and electricity consumption. In the past, enterprises generally lacked complete statistical data and detailed analysis in terms of quotas, so unreasonable phenomena occurred in reserve quotas; the determination of working capital control figures did not have reliable basis. In this way, the enterprise's control figures showed excessively high or excessively low phenomena. This situation needs to be improved urgently after clearing assets and verifying funds.

Due to the lack of quotas for raw material reserves in the past, and the disconnection between production plans and material supply plans, and product sales plans, funds cannot be reasonably adjusted in the production and circulation process. Due to the high cost and low quality of products, or non-compliance with specifications, due to some blindness in production, products are out of touch with market needs; coupled with the failure to earnestly implement production and sales contracts and correct price policies, products are backlogged, affecting capital turnover. This is a problem that needs to be solved urgently in the clearing of assets and verification of funds. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the disposal of excess reserves and stagnant materials at present.

For excess reserves and stagnant materials, the responsible cadres of the enterprise should personally take action, equip full-time cadres, and establish temporary disposal institutions to ensure that these materials can be reasonably adjusted and used. For the state's reserve materials, they should be handed over to the state reserve agency according to certain procedures. For valuable cultural relics, they should be reported level by level and requested for disposal. For the materials needed for the enterprise's future production, opinions can be put forward and sent to the higher-level leading organs for approval, and contracts can be signed with the material management department for payment in installments. Some valuable equipment is not needed for the enterprise's current production, but will still be needed after a certain period; for this part of the equipment, a special excess reserve plan should be formulated and submitted to the higher-level leading organs for approval. All materials needed by other departments can be transferred and sold at a price, and reasonably allocated, and the proceeds should be handed over to the state treasury level by level. Those that are neither state reserve materials, nor needed by the enterprise or other departments, the enterprises can establish close contact with state-owned trading departments, trust departments, and material management departments, and sell them in an organized, planned, and step-by-step manner; attention should be paid to the impact on the market when selling.

In the process of handling excess reserves and stagnant materials, valuation should be carried out seriously and strictly, with a realistic attitude, and prevent unprincipled price reductions or increases. Leading cadres should be responsible for reviewing and conducting necessary inspections and supervision. For backlogged products, they should be promoted in a planned manner, and prices can be appropriately reduced when necessary. In promoting products, they should also actively contact relevant departments, exchange information, or entrust sales.

How to Implement the Decision of Clearing Assets and Verifying Funds to the End

The purpose of clearing assets and verifying funds is to implement the economic accounting system, so that the production plan and financial plan for 1952 can be further improved. The production plan for 1952 of each state-owned enterprise should not be formalistic and lifeless, but should be practical and full of fighting spirit. Otherwise, it will be impossible to establish a truly consolidated economic accounting system, and the goal of increasing production and practicing economy will not be achieved. The administrative leading cadres of each state-owned enterprise should become more tense, closely cooperate with the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, rely on and mobilize the workers and masses, criticize various erroneous ideas, formulate action plans to increase production and practice economy, conduct thorough technical preparations, and combine the clearing of assets and verification of funds well with the current central work. The leading cadres should pay special attention to and strongly support the basic systems established after clearing assets and verifying funds, and regularly inspect them. Criticisms or sanctions should be given to phenomena and personnel who violate the system in a timely manner; those who implement the system well should also be rewarded in a timely manner. The supply departments of state-owned enterprises should immediately determine the supply scope of the upper and lower departments, verify the funds of the supply units, shorten the time for purchasing, inspecting, storing, and receiving and issuing raw materials, and formulate raw material consumption quotas. The sales department should expand sales business, strengthen publicity, implement the contract system, and reduce commodity circulation expenses. In terms of financial accounting and settlement, a strict bank settlement system should be established, cash management methods should be observed, and creditor's rights and debts should be quickly cleared.

Clearing assets and verifying funds is a central part of the patriotic increase in production and economy in state-owned enterprises at present, and it is the basic requirement of the state for state-owned enterprises. On the basis of clearing assets and verifying funds, we must make the funds used reasonably, make the sense of responsibility of leading cadres even higher, make the enthusiasm of employees even greater, and push the operation and management of state-owned enterprises one step further, opening up a wider road for our country's economic construction.

    清理资产核定资金是增产节约的一个重要内容
    樊一萍
    国营企业是增产节约运动中最重要的环节。要达到增产节约的目的，必须认真地清理资产、严格地核定资金。全国国营企业清理资产核定资金的基本情况
    国营企业的清理资产核定资金工作，一般的是分五个阶段进行的。这五个阶段就是：清点登记，鉴定估价，制定定额，编制计划，核定资金。各部门各地区的工作，在发展和进度上是不大平衡的。有
    一大部分企业的清理、覆查、登记、鉴定、估价工作已基本上完成或接近完成，正在进行制定定额、编制计划，研究资金的运用情况，进行核定流动资金的准备；有少数单位已初步地核定了资金；还有
    一些企业单位清理资产工作已经结束，正在进行估价；还有少数部门已经做好清点资产的准备工作，或已开始进行典型试验，以推动全盘。
    这一阶段的工作经验证明，凡是重视和抓紧这一工作的企业单位，就做出了显著的成绩。主要表现在：第一、各单位揭发了严重的资金积压浪费的现象，清理出大批账外物资，克服了有账无物、有物无账的混乱现象。像中央燃料工业部淮南矿务局查出账外物资共值一百零一亿五千万元；郑州铁路管理局的账外物资就值一百九十五亿元；西南军政委员会工业部所属一○一厂的账外物资，估计如全部清出，可达一万吨左右。在“废品”中也清出大量可用的器材。如国营天津第二棉纺织厂在废料中拣出一部一千瓩的发电机。积压材料的现象，也非常严重。国营天津第一棉纺织厂积压的钢领可供本厂使用一百五十二年；上海各国营棉纺织厂，在清理资产以前，检查出浪费总值达到一千五百亿元。像这样的情况，在国营企业清理资产核定资金以前，是很普遍的。第二、通过清理资产核定资金，许多企业的领导干部，基本上从心中无数做到了心中有数，认识到过去不是资金不足，而是资金周转迟缓；批判了不重视生产管理和财务管理的态度，认识了宽打窄用、有备无患、不计成本的保守思想和本位主义，对国家整体利益和企业经营的危害性。第三、有的厂矿在清理资产过程中，开始建立了比较完整的制度，像资产管理制度、原材料化验制度等，巩固了清点的成果。第四、大部分厂矿在这个工作中更加提高了工人群众的政治觉悟；并且在这个基础上，使企业生产更加前进一步。有的单位曾举办了反浪费展览会，展开了反浪费的思想斗争，使全体职工自觉地树立了爱护国家财产的观念。
    但在清理资产核定资金过程中，也有不少的缺点。如国营天津第二棉纺织厂一个细纱间的干部在清理资产中打埋伏隐藏了四千枚锭子，预备明年独立经营后，拿这批账外物资来“降低成本”。北京市专卖公司东郊酿造厂的领导干部在清理资产核定资金过程中，没有认真发动群众，认为工人落后，没有文化，所以清理资产核定资金就不让工人参加。工人也认为这是行政方面的事，与自己无关。再如西南区某厂的领导干部，认为已经清理好了，不愿进行覆查；后经上级检查，又清出了上万吨的物资。也有一些单位在清理资产过程中，不同时建立制度，以致“前清后乱”和“随清随乱”，造成返工和不应有的浪费。也还有个别高级领导机关，到现在为止，还没有把国营企业清理资产核定资金的决定和办法下达到所属部门。总之，现在还有一些企业的领导干部没有重视清理资产核定资金工作；这是急须加以纠正的。
    不清理资产核定资金，就不能达到增产节约的目的
    全国现正展开一个大规模的增产节约运动。有一些企业领导干部认为应当先清理资产核定资金，然后再搞增产节约；也有的认为增产节约既是目前的中心政治任务，就不认真地清理资产和严格地核定资金；这两种看法都是不正确的。
    我们要把落后的农业国变为强大的工业国，需要大量的资金。增产节约是国家积累资金的基本源泉；节约资金是增产节约的一个重要部分。要节约资金，首先必需核定资金，从而加强资金管理，以便最有效而合理地使用资金。
    清理资产与核定资金可以节省大量的流动资金。目前国营企业的资金积压和浪费，是一个普遍的现象和严重的问题。从有些企业清理资产中，证明了过去企业的资金是多余的而不是不足的。如中央燃料工业部淮南矿务局，清理资产核定资金以后，初步决定上缴物资共达二百一十九亿元；华北纺织管理局清出的呆滞物资、超储材料和准备上缴的流动资金达两千亿元；中央铁道部清理资产核定资金实行经济核算制以后，计划把四万亿元的材料总值上缴给国家。全国国营企业核定资金以后，所节约的流动资金的汇总数字，将是一个可观的数目。因之，核定资金对企业的增产节约是一个最重要的环节。
    正确地核定资金，才能正确地制订增产节约计划。目前，有些国营企业在清理资产核定资金中，检查了一九五一年流动资金的运用情况以及消耗定额的实际执行情况，然后，根据一九五二年的控制数字，制订了增产节约计划。中央贸易部拟于一九五二年节约商品流转费用百分之二十五。西北军政委员会工业部所属各单位拟于一九五二年增加生产百分之八，降低成本百分之十。
    抓住主要的环节，彻底完成清理资产核定资金工作
    为了在增产节约运动中有领导有步骤地进行核定资金工作，所有国营企业应该抓住几个关键。
    在清理资产核定资金过程中，应建立几种基本制度；否则就会一面清，一面乱，造成新的积压资金的现象。这些制度应该包括资产管理制度、独立的会计制度和财务制度、合同制度、奖励制度、基本建设的施工程序等。制订这些制度时，必须发动群众讨论。只有通过工人群众的讨论而建立起来的制度，工人才能自觉地遵守。
    确定先进的经济定额，是订立流动资金指标的前题。流动资金的组织是依据企业生产性质及实际所需的原材料、燃料、辅助材料、备品、低值易耗品、在制品、产品、预付费用和库存现金而决定的。订立流动资金指标，必须由企业所有的技术人员、财务人员、管理人员和供销人员共同研究企业的供销情况，制订流动资金使用计划。流动资金定额的规定，应非常具体、实际，要和企业的供应情况、原材料储备定额、消耗定额相配合，不能草率估计。制定流动资金定额指标，要适应生产过程和生产规模的变化；并且要考虑劳动效率的进一步提高。流动资金定额的确定，一定要按先进的标准，而不是按保守落后的标准。在节约流动资金过程中，要为节约原料、材料、燃料和电力消耗而进行思想斗争。过去各企业单位在定额方面，一般地说都缺乏完整的统计资料和详细的分析，因此在储备定额上发生不合理的现象；流动资金控制数字的确定没有可靠的根据。这样，企业的控制数字就发生了偏高或偏低的现象。清理资产核定资金后，急须改进这种情况。
    由于过去原材料储备没有定额，以及生产计划和物资供应计划、产品销售计划的某些脱节，资金在生产流通过程中，不能受到合理的调剂。由于产品的成本高、质量低，或不合规格，由于生产中的一些盲目性，产品与市场需要脱节；加以没有认真地执行产销合同和正确的价格政策，产品就被积压起来，影响到资金的周转。这是在清理资产核定资金中亟须解决的问题。因此，对超额储备和呆滞材料的处理，目前应当特别注意。
    对于超额储备和呆滞材料，企业的负责干部应亲自动手，配备专职干部，建立临时处理机构，使这些物资能被合理地调剂和运用。对于国家的储备物资，应按一定手续上缴给国家储备机构。对于有价值的文物，应逐级上报，请求处理。对于本企业今后生产上需要的物资，可提出意见，送请上级领导机关批准后，与物资管理部门订定合同，分期付款。有些贵重器材是目前本企业生产上不需要，但经过一定时期仍然需要的；对于这一部分器材应制订特殊超额储备计划，报请上级领导机关批准。凡是其他部门需要的材料，可以作价转售，予以合理地调配，并且把价款逐级上缴国库。那些既不是国家储备物资，也不是本企业或其它部门需要的，各企业可和国营贸易部门、信托部门、物资管理部门取得密切联系，有组织有计划有步骤地出售；出售时应注意对市场的影响。
    在处理超额储备和呆滞材料的过程中，要认真地严肃地进行估价，以实事求是的态度，防止无原则地压低或抬高价格。领导干部应负责审查，并进行必要的检查和监督。对积压的产品，应进行有计划地推销，必要时可适当地降低价格。在推销产品中，也应主动地和有关部门取得联系，交换情况或委托推销。
    怎样把清理资产核定资金的决定贯彻到底
    清理资产核定资金的目的，就是为了实行经济核算制，使一九五二年的生产计划和财务计划更加提高一步。各个国营企业一九五二年的生产计划，不应是形式主义的、毫无生气的，而应是切合实际的富有战斗性的。否则，就不可能建立起真正的巩固的经济核算制，也就达不到增产节约的目的。各个国营企业的行政领导干部应该更加紧张起来，和党、工会、青年团密切配合，依靠和发动工人群众，批判各种错误思想，拟定增产节约的行动计划，进行周密的技术准备，把清理资产核定资金和当前的中心工作很好地结合起来。在清理资产核定资金以后所建立的基本制度，领导干部要特别重视和大力支持，经常地加以检查。对违犯制度的现象和人员，要适时地进行批评或处分；对执行制度好的，也要及时地奖励。国营企业的供应部门，应即确定上下部门的供应范围，核定供应单位的资金，缩短采购、检验、保管、收发原材料的时间，制定原材料消耗定额。销售部门应展开销售业务，加强宣传，执行合同制度，减低商品流转费用。在财务会计结算方面，要严格地建立银行结算制度，遵守现金管理办法，迅速清理债权债务。
    清理资产核定资金是目前国营企业爱国增产节约的一个中心内容，是国家对国营企业的基本要求。要在清理资产核定资金的基础上，使资金得以合理地运用，使领导干部的责任心更加提高，使职工的积极性得以更大地发挥，把国营企业的经营管理工作推进一步，为我们国家的经济建设，开辟更广阔的道路。
