Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th - The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the four major systems of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau, the South China Branch of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, and the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government has unfolded vigorously. On January 2nd, the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau held an expanded meeting of its Standing Committee to review the progress of the past movement, and the members of the Sub-bureau took the lead in making self-criticisms at the meeting. On the 3rd, Ye Jianying, the First Secretary of the Sub-bureau, personally wrote a circular instructing leaders at all levels to take the lead in self-criticism and personally lead the struggle at the front line. In the past ten days or so, the weak and ineffective state of the movement in December of last year, where the masses were not mobilized, has been completely reversed. The movement is now being carried out vigorously in the directly subordinate organs of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau, the South China Branch of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, and the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government. The vast majority of leaders at all levels in these four systems have already made self-criticisms. A mass movement of confession and denunciation against corruption and waste has begun to take shape.

At the various meetings held one after another, many corrupt elements have confessed, and some who were unwilling to confess have been denounced by others. For example, Wang Jianpeng, Director of the Municipal Enterprise Bureau, was denounced for multiple acts of corruption, with embezzled funds amounting to 200 million yuan. Cultural and educational organs, which were previously thought to have no access to corruption or power to waste, have also uncovered serious facts of corruption and waste. For example, the South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles spent a total of 1.5 billion yuan in operating expenses over the past two years, of which about 400 million yuan was wasted or used for extra-budgetary expenses for a small number of people. In the past, extravagance and waste were prevalent in Guangzhou, and many people were not ashamed of damaging state wealth, but instead regarded it as a sign of local affluence. This erroneous thinking has now been severely criticized. The movement also revealed that many cadres in the past had an extremely erroneous view of worshiping the "material civilization" of imperialism, such as using foreign materials to build houses, buying foreign furniture such as tables and chairs, and being satisfied only with using British and American goods for everything from shirts and underwear to handkerchiefs and toothpaste. These erroneous views have also been severely criticized.

In the past ten days or so, the ideological struggle against the poisons of the old society has been carried out fiercely in every branch of the Communist Party. Although the movement has not yet been fully extended to the masses of the people, the people have expressed their support and praise. They said, "We have never seen such a responsible government and cadres in our lives!" "The Kuomintang was full of corruption, officials protecting each other, and covering up at every level. The People's Government is truly a clean and wise government, and cadres correct their mistakes immediately."

The reason why the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Guangzhou was able to quickly correct its weaknesses and unfold vigorously is primarily because, after repeated mobilization, the cadres changed their understanding and attitude towards the movement. In the past twelve days, Ye Jianying made several mobilization reports at various meetings, repeatedly explaining that this movement is a profound ideological struggle and a serious political struggle. He particularly pointed out that South China is a region that has been influenced by imperialist ideology for the longest and deepest time, and where the poisons of the old society are the most concentrated. We must be especially vigilant against the enemy, who has been defeated on the battlefield, and is now using the method of corrupting our cadres to fight us. In this way, the cadres of various organs changed their understanding of this movement, resolutely implemented the policy of "bathing at each level" and "personally commanding the front line," thus enabling the mass movement of confession and denunciation against corruption and waste to develop smoothly. Secondly, it was because discipline was announced in the movement, and the bad style of suppressing democracy was resolutely stopped. When some people with unclean hands refused to confess and suppressed democracy, the higher-level leading organs immediately went down to work themselves. For example, when Ren Haishan, manager of the Provincial Department Store, only moved the lower levels and not the upper levels in the movement, and made false reports to the higher authorities, saying: "There is no corruption in the company," "The movement has been launched, and the masses are in high spirits," Zhu Jingzhi, Director of the Provincial Department of Commerce, went directly to the company to mobilize the masses and transferred Ren Haishan from his post to await processing.

The people of all walks of life have begun to actively participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. After the Southern Daily published an editorial calling on the people of the city to denounce corrupt elements, it received a total of 161 letters of denunciation from the people of all walks of life from the 7th to the 13th, and people went to the newspaper office to make oral denunciations every day. On the industrial and commercial front, a mobilization meeting against bribery, profiteering, tax evasion, and waste was held on the 11th, with more than 1,200 representatives from more than 100 industries participating. This movement will soon be launched in the industrial and commercial circles of the city.

    中共中央华南分局等系统的领导干部带头检讨
    反贪污反浪费的斗争猛烈展开
    广州工商界发动反对贿赂漏税等行为
    【新华社广州十五日电】中共中央华南分局、中南军政委员会财政经济委员会华南分会、广东省人民政府和广州市人民政府四大系统的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动已大张旗鼓地展开。一月二日中共中央华南分局举行常委扩大会议，检查过去运动的情况，分局委员带头在会上作了自我检讨。分局第一书记叶剑英在三日亲自写出通报，责成各级首长必须层层带头检讨和亲上前线领导斗争。十多天来，已完全扭转去年十二月间运动软弱无力、群众没有发动的局面。现在运动已经在中共中央华南分局各直属机关、中南军政委员会财政经济委员会华南分会、广东省人民政府和广州市人民政府各机关雷厉风行地展开。这四个系统的各级首长绝大部分都已做了自我检讨。群众性的反贪污浪费的坦白、检举运动业已开始形成。
    在接连举行的各次会议上，已有不少贪污分子进行了坦白，有些不愿坦白的被别人检举出来。如市企业局局长王剑朋被检举出贪污事实多件，贪污款项达二亿元。一向被认为贪污无门、浪费无权的文教机关也检查出严重的贪污浪费事实。如华南文学艺术界联合会两年来共用去十五亿元的事业费，其中约四亿元被浪费掉或用于少数人员的超制度开支。过去广州市铺张浪费，相竞成风，不少人不以损耗国家财富为耻，反认为这是地方富庶的表现。这种错误思想现已受到严厉的批评。在运动中并发现过去有不少干部存在着崇拜帝国主义“物质文明”的极端错误观点，如修房子要用外国材料，桌椅沙发要买外国货，小而至衬衣、衬裤、手帕、牙膏都要用英美货才能满足。这些错误观点也已受到严厉的批评。
    十多天来，反对旧社会的污毒的思想斗争已在共产党内每一个支部中猛烈进行。目前运动虽还未全面地推广到社会群众中去，但人民群众已纷纷表示拥护和赞扬。他们说：“有生以来未见过这样负责任的政府和干部！”“国民党贪污满天下，官官相卫，层层包庇。人民政府真正是廉洁英明的政府，干部有了错误就马上纠正。”
    广州市的反贪污浪费和官僚主义运动能够迅速纠正弱点，雷厉风行地展开，首先是因为经过反复动员，干部改变了对运动的认识和态度。十二天来，叶剑英曾在各种会议上做了多次动员报告，反复说明这个运动是一场深刻的思想斗争，一场严重的政治斗争。他特别指出华南是一个受帝国主义思想影响最久最深，旧社会的污毒最浓厚的地方，必须特别警惕在战场上已被打败的敌人正在用腐化我们干部的方法来作斗争。这样，各机关的干部就改变了对这一运动的认识，坚决执行了“逐级下水洗澡”和“亲上前线指挥”的方针，因而使群众性的反贪污、反浪费的坦白检举运动顺利开展起来。其次是因为在运动中宣布了纪律，坚决制止压制民主的恶劣作风。当某些手上不干净的人拒不坦白，压制民主时，上级领导机关就立即亲自下去动手。如省百货公司经理任海山在运动中只动下面、不动上面，向上级作假报告说：“公司里没有什么贪污”，“运动已经开展，群众情绪高涨”。省商业厅厅长朱竟之就直接到公司去发动群众，并将任海山调职听候处理。
    各界人民群众对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已开始积极参加。南方日报发表号召全市人民检举贪污分子的社论后，从七日到十三日已共收到各界人民的检举信一百六十一封，每天都有人到报社去口头检举。工商界方面已在十一日举行了一百多个行业代表共一千二百多人参加的反贿赂、反暴利、反漏税、反浪费动员大会，这一运动即将在全市工商界中展开。
