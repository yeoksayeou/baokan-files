　　Xinhua News Agency, Antung, January 24th: While the American aggressors are dragging out the Korean armistice negotiations, American planes continue to intrude into our Northeast airspace for bombing. At 7 p.m. on the 19th, an enemy plane intruded into the territory of Ji'an County, Liaodong Province, dropping seven bombs in Maxian Gou, destroying three civilian houses and wounding three oxen and one horse. At 2 p.m. on the 20th, an enemy plane intruded 10 kilometers into our territory from the direction of Biktong, Korea. At 9 a.m. on the 21st, nineteen enemy planes intruded into Siping Street, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, for reconnaissance; on the same day, another batch of eight enemy planes intruded into the airspace over Antung City, Liaodong Province, and were repelled by our anti-aircraft artillery units.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 24th: Our front-line reporter reports: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has once again seized military aviation maps printed with places such as our capital, Beijing, from an American Air Force pilot prisoner. This prisoner is Second Lieutenant Swit, a pilot of the 67th Squadron of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing of the U.S. Air Force in Korea. He was shot down by our ground anti-aircraft fire while piloting a P51 fighter plane to attack a certain place in northern Korea on January 1st of this year, and was captured after parachuting. He was carrying four silk military aviation maps with a scale of 1:1,000,000, printed with Beijing, Shenyang, Lushun, Dalian, and Vladivostok. According to Swit, he had to carry these maps every time he flew in order to receive the squad leader's orders to carry out specific tasks. It is not the first time that American Air Force pilots in Korea have carried military aviation maps of our Beijing and other places during flights; nor is it the first time since the beginning of this year that the American Air Force in Korea has invaded our Northeast airspace. This action of the American aggressors deserves serious attention from our people.

    我国人民应严重注意美国侵略者的挑衅
    美机竟继续侵入我东北领空轰炸
    我又一次缴获美机携带的我北京等地军用航空地图
    【新华社安东二十四日电】在美国侵略者拖延朝鲜停战谈判期间，美国飞机继续侵入我东北领空轰炸。十九日下午七时，敌机一架侵入我辽东省辑安县境，在麻线沟投弹七枚，炸毁民房三间，炸伤耕牛三头及马一匹。二十日下午二时，敌机一架由朝鲜碧潼方向侵入我国境十公里。二十一日上午九时，敌机十九架，侵入我辽东省宽甸县四平街进行侦察；同日另批敌机八架侵入我辽东省安东市上空，被我高射炮部队击退。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】本社前线记者报道：中国人民志愿军部队从一个美国空军驾驶员俘虏身上，又一次缴获印有我国首都北京等地的军用航空地图。这个俘虏是侵朝美国空军第十八战斗轰炸机联队十八大队六十七中队的少尉驾驶员斯瑞特。他是在今年一月一日驾驶一架P51型战斗机袭击朝鲜北部某地时被我地面高射炮火击中，跳伞后被俘的。他随身携带着印有北京、沈阳、旅顺、大连及海参崴的百万分之一的绢质军用航空地图四幅。据斯瑞特说，他在每次飞行时都要带着这些地图，以便接受小队长的命令执行具体的任务。侵朝美国空军驾驶员在飞行时，携带我国北京等地军用航空地图的事情，已经不只一次；今年以来侵朝美国空军侵袭我国东北领空的事件，也已不只一次，美国侵略者的这种行动值得我国人民严重注意。
