    I Examine My Bureaucratic Work Style
    Comrade Editor: With the unfolding of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement across the country, our Taiyuan South Station Locomotive Section has also launched an inspection. Initially, I thought our section wasn't a financial department, so there wasn't much to investigate. The inspection revealed serious waste caused by the bureaucratic work style of leading cadres.
    I always believed that the workers could complete their tasks on time, so there was no need to pay too much attention to small details. As a result, after the workers finished studying, they didn't immediately start working. Some drank water, some had snacks, some chatted and laughed, and some even ate or rested before the designated time. These situations caused a serious waste of working time. The entire section now has more than 460 employees, and after subtracting the train crew, there are still about 300 people. I calculated that due to insufficient working hours for each person, approximately 37.5 labor units are wasted each day. The monthly expense for 37.5 people is 8,474 points, which amounts to 101,688 points per year, equivalent to more than 229 million yuan in Renminbi. The harm of bureaucratic work style to the people's property is so serious!

        Taiyuan South Station Locomotive Section Chief Li Yue

    我检查了我的官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：随着全国各地反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的展开，我们太原南站机务段也展开了检查。起初，我认为我段不是财经部门，没有什么可查的。检查结果，发现了因领导干部官僚主义作风造成的严重浪费现象。
    我一向以为职工们都能按期完成任务，不必太注意小地方。这样，职工学习完后，就不立刻工作，有的喝水，有的吃点心，有的说笑，甚至有的不到点就吃饭或休息。这些情况，造成了工作时间的严重浪费。全段现在有职工四百六十多人，减去乘务员，还有三百人左右。我计算一下，由于每人工作时间不足，每天约浪费三十七个半人力。三十七个半人每月开支需八千四百七十四分，一年就要十万零一千六百八十八分，折合人民币两亿二千九百多万元。官僚主义作风对人民财产的危害，竟是这么严重！　　　太原南站机务段长　李岳
