The announcement by this newspaper on December 30th of last year regarding the crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in stealing state property, engaging in corruption and bribery, violating laws and regulations, and betraying the Party and the people, as well as the announcement of the decision by the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP to expel Liu and Zhang from the Party, has been met with unanimous support from Party members and non-Party members.

The first-level organs and organizations in the North China region have all launched discussions on the Liu and Zhang incident. It is unanimously believed that the exposure of the Liu and Zhang incident is a great victory for our Party. It proves that Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction on increasing production and practicing economy, opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy is great, correct, and perfectly timely. Many cadres in the Political Department of the North China Military Region have deeply realized the seriousness of the corrosion of bourgeois ideology on the revolutionary troops from the Liu and Zhang incident, and have conducted self-examination in connection with their own thoughts. Some people said, "In the past, I thought there was nothing wrong with my arrogance and complacency. Today, seeing the seriousness of the mistakes made by Liu and Zhang, I am shocked. We should always be vigilant." Comrades in the Confidential Section of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the CCP, after discussion, realized that Liu and Zhang not only committed corruption crimes, but more seriously, Liu and Zhang used their positions and used the organization to corrupt the Party and disintegrate the Party, wanting the Party to serve their despicable purposes. This is a political crime of betraying the Party.

Party members of the Party School of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP believe that the measures taken by the Provincial Committee on the Liu and Zhang incident are completely correct and express unanimous support. Trainee Zhang Wenmao (Head of the Propaganda Department of the Wanping County Party Committee) said: "Judging from the criminal facts of Liu and Zhang, they are completely at odds with the Party and have completely deteriorated. I completely agree with the Provincial Committee's handling of Liu and Zhang." At the second Party Congress convened by the Ding County Party Committee, 744 Party members wrote to the Provincial Committee expressing their firm support for the Provincial Committee's expulsion of Liu and Zhang from the Party. Some new cadres in the Hebei Provincial People's Government also reacted: "The Communist Party can openly expose its own mistakes, and even old cadres like Liu and Zhang will be dealt with seriously if they make mistakes. The Communist Party is truly great!"

The Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the CCP convened a plenary meeting of all Party members at the prefectural level on December 17 to convey and discuss the Provincial Committee's decision on the Liu and Zhang incident. All Party members further exposed the crimes of Liu and Zhang and expressed their heartfelt support for the Provincial Committee's decision to expel Liu and Zhang from the Party. They said: "Through this struggle against the crimes of Liu and Zhang, our ideological level has been raised, and the boundaries between the proletariat and the decadent bourgeois ideology have been initially clarified." After discussing this incident, most Party members in Party and government agencies, schools, and organizations at all levels in Tianjin recognized that if the erosion of bourgeois ideology is not extinguished in time, it may lead to the danger of "the Party's destruction, the country's destruction, and the individual's demise." Therefore, they further realized the importance of the current anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle. Many Party members have issued warnings to themselves, saying: "Liu and Zhang did not waver or defect in the harsh environment, but after the victory, they were tempted by the world of pleasure, resulting in the crime of betraying the Party and the people. The bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets must be guarded against!"

The personnel of the above-mentioned agencies and organizations expressed unparalleled anger at the crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan. They unanimously proposed: convene a meeting, hold a public trial, and severely punish them according to the law of the country, so as to educate Party members and the masses and to recover the bad influence they have left on the Party and the People's Government in the minds of the people. The workers and masses in Tianjin believe that the crimes of Liu and Zhang are serious, and they unanimously support severely punishing these two big embezzlers. There are also a few individuals who believe that Liu and Zhang "have been revolutionizing for more than 20 years and have made contributions to the revolution, so it is a pity to expel them." This erroneous attitude was immediately severely criticized. Comrades in the Confidential Section of the North China Bureau sharply pointed out: The Communist Party is selfless and deals with matters, not people. Since Liu and Zhang have committed the crime of betraying the Party and the people, they must be dealt with in accordance with Party discipline and national law and cannot be accommodated.

Generally, Party members and the masses expressed dissatisfaction with the bureaucratic style of the leadership of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP. Everyone questioned, "Why didn't the Hebei Provincial Committee discover this matter for a long time?" "Someone reported to the Provincial Committee beforehand, why didn't the Provincial Committee deal with it for a long time?" "Is anyone protecting them?" Chen Dian, a resident member of the Hebei Provincial Consultative Committee, said: "The Liu and Zhang incident is so big, the time is so long, and there are so many leading organs, why doesn't anyone know?" Party members in various places also unanimously believe that the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP must conduct a serious and in-depth review and make a public reply in the newspaper.

    广大党内外群众
    一致拥护开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决定
    本报去年十二月三十日公布了刘青山、张子善盗窃国家资财，贪污行贿，违法乱纪，叛党叛人民的罪行，并公布了中共河北省委开除刘、张党籍的决议，获得党内外群众一致拥护。
    华北区一级机关、团体都对刘、张事件展开讨论。一致认为：这次刘、张事件的揭发，是我党一个很大的胜利。证明了毛主席提出的增产节约、反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的英明指示，是伟大的，正确的，完全适合时宜的。华北军区政治部的许多干部，从刘、张事件中，深深体会到资产阶级思想对革命部队腐蚀的严重性，都联系自己的思想，进行了检讨。有人说：“过去认为我的居功自傲思想没有什么，今天看到刘、张所犯错误的严重性，自己大吃一惊，我们应该时时警惕自己。”中共中央华北局机要处的同志们，经过讨论，认识到刘、张不仅仅是犯了贪污罪行，更严重的是刘、张利用职权，利用组织腐蚀党、瓦解党，要党为他们的卑鄙目的服务，这是一种叛党的政治罪恶。
    中共河北省委党校的党员，认为省委对刘、张事件采取的措施是完全正确的，表示一致拥护。学员张文茂（宛平县委宣传部长）说：“从刘、张二人的犯罪事实看，他们和党完全是两条心，已经完全变质啦，省委对刘、张的处理，我完全同意。”定县县委召开的第二次党的代表会议上，七百四十四名党员给省委写信表示：坚决拥护省委开除刘、张的党籍。河北省人民政府有些新干部也反应：“共产党能够公开揭发自己的错误，甚至对刘、张这样老的干部，犯了错误也一样认真处理，共产党真是伟大！”
    中共天津地委在十二月十七日召开了专区级全体党员大会，传达和讨论省委对刘、张事件的决议。全体党员进一步揭发了刘、张的罪行，对省委开除刘、张党籍的决议，表示衷心的拥护。他们说：“经过这次反对刘、张罪行的斗争，使我们的思想水平提高了，初步划清了无产阶级和腐朽的资产阶级思想的界限”。天津市各级党政机关及学校、团体，多数党员经过对这一事件的讨论，认识到资产阶级思想的侵袭，如不及时扑灭，可能招致“亡党亡国亡头”的危险。因而也进一步认识到目前开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的重要意义。很多党员都对自己提出了警告，表示：“刘、张二人在残酷的环境中，没有动摇变节；胜利后却被花花世界所诱惑，造成叛党叛人民的罪恶，资产阶级的这种糖衣炮弹是必须警惕的！”
    上述各机关、团体的人员，对刘青山、张子善的罪行，表示无比的愤怒。一致提议：召开大会，举行公审，依照国法，严厉惩办。以便教育党员和群众，并挽回他们给党和人民政府在人民群众中所留下的恶劣影响。天津市职工群众认为刘、张的罪恶是严重的，他们一致拥护严厉惩办这两个大贪污分子。也有个别的人认为刘、张“革命二十多年了，对革命有贡献，开除了太可惜”。这种错误态度，立即受到了严厉的批判。华北局机要处的同志们尖锐地指出：共产党是大公无私的，对事不对人，刘、张既然犯了叛党叛人民的罪行，就必须按照党纪国法来处理，不能迁就。
    一般党员和群众，对中共河北省委领导方面的官僚主义作风，表示不满。大家纷纷质问：“河北省委为什么长期没有发觉这件事情？”“事前有人向省委反映，省委为什么长期没有处理？”“是否有人包庇他们？”河北省协商委员会驻会委员陈迪安说：“刘、张事件这样大，时间这样长，领导机关这样多，为什么都不知道？”各地党员也一致认为：中共河北省委必须认真地深刻地进行检查，并在报纸上作公开答复。
