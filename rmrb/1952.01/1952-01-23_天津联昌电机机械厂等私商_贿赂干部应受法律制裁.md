    Private Merchants such as Tianjin Lianchang Electrical Machinery Factory
    should be Punished by Law for Bribing Cadres
    Editor: The bosses of private Tianjin Lianchang Electrical Machinery Factory and Juxingcheng Zhongji Hardware Store in Tianjin have committed the crime of bribing cadres of the Taiyuan Water Company.

    In October 1950, Mao Changwen, the business director of Lianchang Electrical Machinery Factory, bribed Wei Zhiming, the deputy manager of Taiyuan Water Company, with one million yuan, and bribed Yang Jiyun and Shen Chang, two purchasing agents, with one million yuan. Mao Changwen wined and dined with them, and even gave Yang and Shen Zhonghua cigarettes as parting gifts. Last year, during business transactions, Mao also gave Wei and Yang two pairs of wool pants and Zhonghua cigarettes. The water meters sold by Lianchang Electrical Machinery Factory to the Water Company were of such poor quality due to shoddy workmanship that the best ones needed to be repaired every three months, and the worst ones every ten days. Last October, the Water Company sent Wei and Yang to Lianchang Electrical Machinery Factory to pre-order a batch of water meters worth more than 120 million yuan, and paid a deposit of
    100 million yuan, specifying that the delivery date was November 15th. However, this factory was not trustworthy and was more than two months overdue, with more than 80 million yuan worth of water meters still undelivered.

    The capitalists of Juxingcheng Zhongji Hardware Store also used this method to corrupt our cadres. In October 1950, Wang Shengwu of Juxingcheng bribed Yang Jiyun and Shen Chang, purchasing personnel sent by the Water Company, with 500,000 yuan, and successively bribed Wei Zhiming with 2.08 million yuan. Last July, the Water Company sent these purchasing personnel to Shanghai, Nanjing and other places to purchase 3.5-inch white lead pipes. However, these corrupt elements who were bought off by unscrupulous merchants claimed that they could not be bought elsewhere, and as a result, they bought 800 feet from Juxingcheng at a high price of 210,000 yuan per foot. If such unscrupulous merchants cannot confess thoroughly, they should be punished by the law of the country. Zhao Yiping

### 天津联昌电机机械厂等私商  贿赂干部应受法律制裁

    天津联昌电机机械厂等私商
    贿赂干部应受法律制裁
    编辑同志：天津市私营联昌电机机械厂和聚兴诚仲记五金行的老板，有贿赂太原市自来水公司干部的犯法行为。
    联昌电机机械厂业务主任毛长文，在一九五○年十月，向太原市自来水公司副经理魏志明行贿一百万元，向采购员杨际云、申畅两人行贿一百万元。毛长文和他们吃饭跳舞，临别时还送给杨、申两人前门牌香烟。去年在往来交易时，毛又送魏、杨两人绒裤两条和前门牌香烟。联昌电机机械厂卖给自来水公司的水表，因偷工减料，质量太坏，最好的走三个月就得修一次，坏的走十天就要修一次。去年十月，自来水公司派魏、杨两人向联昌电机机械厂预定水表一批，共值一亿二千多万元，预付现款
    一亿元，当时言明交货日期为十一月十五日。但这个厂不讲信用，过期两个月，还有八千多万元的水表未交。
    聚兴诚仲记五金行的资方也用这种手段腐蚀我们的干部。一九五○年十月，聚兴诚王绳武向自来水公司派出的采购人员杨际云、申畅行贿五十万元，并先后向魏志明行贿二百零八万元。去年七月，自来水公司派这些采购人员到上海、南京等地购买三吋半的白铅管。但这些被奸商收买的贪污分子，竟说别处买不到，结果，以每呎二十一万元的高价，在聚兴诚买进八百呎。像这样的奸商，如果不能彻底坦白，应该给以国法制裁。　赵乙萍
