The North China Region has drafted plans for carrying out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and has universally begun mobilization; some areas have extended it to the prefectural and county levels, and individual units that started earlier have entered the stage of democratic review.

Responding to Chairman Mao's call, Party and government leading organs in North China's provinces and cities made arrangements and mobilized for increased production and thrift in November of last year, and conducted preliminary inspections in conjunction with studying documents. The inspections revealed that corruption and waste were quite prevalent in various organs and organizations. In mid-December, provinces and cities convened various meetings to conduct extensive mobilization against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Responsible comrades from Party and government organizations in various places personally delivered reports, explaining the important significance of carrying out this movement, calling on Party members and non-Party members, superiors and subordinates, to act in unison and vigorously launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. After the Hebei Province convened a Party representative meeting and a people's representative meeting, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting of more than 8,000 Party member cadres from provincial-level organs on December 18, with Deputy Secretary Ma Guorui giving a mobilization report. The five people's organizations of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, the Student Union, the Democratic Women's Federation, and the Democratic Youth Federation also jointly issued a notice on the 18th, calling on workers, youth, women, and students throughout the province to actively participate in this movement. After the Chahar Province held a provincial consultative committee meeting on the 19th, it convened a cadre mobilization meeting of more than 1,000 people on the 20th. Yang Gengtian, secretary of the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, called on all organs and organizations throughout the province to carry out this movement without exception. Shanxi and Pingyuan provinces also convened enlarged cadre meetings, Party and League member meetings, and people's representative meetings. Suiyuan Province, which started the movement earlier, put forward a plan to continue carrying out the movement on the basis of initial achievements. Huang Jing, the Mayor of Tianjin, also gave a mobilization speech at a cadre meeting of nearly 10,000 people on December 15 of last year. In addition, medium and small cities and towns such as Taiyuan, Baoding, and Xuanhua, as well as prefectures such as Xinxiang, Anyang, and Tongxian, have also carried out mobilization, study, and preliminary inspections against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Such large-scale, widespread appeals and mobilization have given the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement a grand scale and momentum from the very beginning throughout the region.

The mobilization reports of responsible comrades in various places, because they were all linked to serious cases of corruption and waste found in preliminary inspections, made Party member cadres and non-Party figures more clearly understand the great political significance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and the major relationship of this movement to increasing production and practicing thrift for national economic construction and improving cadres' thinking and work style, breaking the idea that "there's nothing here." After awakening, many Party member cadres said with emotion, "Fortunately, Chairman Mao sounded the alarm in time." For example, before the mobilization report in Shanxi Province, many Party member cadres believed that Shanxi was known for its thrift and simplicity, that there were many veteran cadres, that they had undergone the "Three Checks" and rectification, and that some corrupt elements had been punished in the past two years, so the problem should not be too big. After the leaders pointed out the facts of corruption and waste, everyone felt that the problem was serious. When more than 2,000 cadres from 25 non-financial and economic departments at the provincial level in Shanxi began centralized rectification, they also thought, "Our organs are clean and have no problems," but after preliminary study and inspection, it was found that there were many cases of corruption in these so-called "no problem" organs, which surprised everyone. These mobilizations and reports also made the broad masses of non-Party figures realize the important significance of carrying out the current struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and the brilliance of Chairman Mao's leadership. At the enlarged meeting of the Shanxi Provincial Consultative Committee, some representatives reflected: "Vigorously suppressing the counter-revolutionaries, and vigorously opposing corruption, removing the rotten things inside and outside, will make national affairs easier to handle." Some representatives exposed the phenomena of corruption and waste existing in certain organs and organizations on the spot, and expressed their active participation in this mass movement. This widespread and in-depth ideological mobilization has made the broad masses of cadres and the masses of the people at home and abroad clearly understand the serious significance of this movement, and has made a good start for further carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

In order to lead this large-scale mass movement well, provinces, cities, and some prefectures have established streamlined thrift inspection committees that include responsible cadres and activists from both inside and outside the Party. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also established an office to specifically study and guide the movement. Various localities have put forward methods and principles for carrying out the movement according to local conditions, and have formulated detailed steps and plans for carrying out this movement. Provincial-level organs and organizations in Shanxi, Hebei, and other places are conducting the movement in the form of rectification. The general steps are determined as: making plans, studying documents, linking to reality, reflecting on and confessing, exposing and reporting, boldly developing democracy, and handling cases separately. The provinces have also proposed to achieve responsibility of the top leaders, personal involvement, leadership at all levels, and in-depth work at each level. State-owned and public-owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province will conduct inspections in conjunction with clearing up assets and verifying funds. Prefectures and counties will convene one or two people's representative meetings before March 1952 to extensively mobilize the masses to expose and report problems. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also formulated four disciplines for carrying out this movement: 1. No suppression of democracy; 2. No taking revenge, attacking others, and elevating oneself; 3. No falsifying evidence to deceive the organization; 4. No leaving rectification for excuses without approval. Pingyuan, Chahar, Suiyuan and other provinces have also formulated steps and plans for carrying out the movement according to the situation in their provinces.

Now this large-scale movement has gradually unfolded throughout the region. In addition to Shanxi Province, which has concentrated more than 2,600 cadres from 25 provincial-level units for rectification, Party member cadres in various organs and organizations in various provinces and cities are mostly conducting the movement in their original organs in conjunction with their work. Currently, most areas are starting to study documents, link to reality, carry out ideological brewing, and conduct preliminary inspections. It is expected that in early 1952, a vigorous and decisive anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement will be widely and deeply carried out throughout the region.

    确定步骤制出计划进行广泛动员
    华北区反贪污浪费运动初步展开
    华北各省市都已做出开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的计划，并已普遍开始动员；部分地区已推展至专区和县，个别开始较早的单位已进入民主检查阶段。
    华北各省市党政领导机关响应毛主席的号召，在去年十一月份即先后进行了增产节约的布置和动员，并结合学习文件进行了初步检查。检查中，发现贪污浪费现象在各机关团体相当普遍地存在着。十二月中旬，各省市先后召开各种会议，进行了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的大动员。各地党政负责同志都亲自作报告，说明开展这一运动的重要意义，号召党内党外、上上下下一致行动起来，大张旗鼓地开展反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动。河北省召开党代表会议、各界人民代表会议之后，中共河北省委员会在十二月十八日举行了省级各机关党员干部八千多人的大会，副书记马国瑞作动员报告。河北省总工会、青年团、学生联合会、民主妇女联合会、民主青年联合会五个人民团体也在十八日联合发出通知，号召全省工人、青年、妇女、学生积极参加这一运动。察哈尔省在十九日举行省协商委员会之后，二十日又召开了一千多人的干部动员大会。中共察哈尔省委员会书记杨耕田号召全省各机关、团体无例外地开展这一运动。山西、平原两省也分别召开了扩大干部会、党团员会、各界人民代表会等。运动开始较早的绥远省，则在取得初步成绩的基础上提出了继续开展这一运动的计划。天津市黄敬市长，去年十二月十五日也在近万人的干部大会上作了动员。此外，太原、保定、宣化等中小城镇以及新乡、安阳、通县等专区，也已进行了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的动员、学习和初步检查。这样大规模的普遍广泛的号召和动员，使反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，在全区范围内开始即显示了规模宏伟、声势浩大的特点。
    各地负责同志的动员报告，因为都联系了当地在初步检查中所发现的严重贪污浪费事例，使党员干部以及党外人士更明确地认识了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的重大政治意义，以及这一运动对增产节约进行国家经济建设和提高干部思想、改进作风等的重大关系，打破了“没有啥”的思想。不少党员干部在警觉起来之后感动地说：“亏着毛主席及时地敲响了警钟”。如山西省在动员报告之前，不少党员干部认为山西素以俭朴闻名，且老干部居多，又多经过三查、整风，近二年来又不断地惩处了一些贪污分子，问题不致于很大吧。待领导者指出了贪污浪费的事实之后，大家才感到问题严重。山西省级二十五个非财经部门的二千多干部开始集中整风时，也认为：“我们这些机关是清水衙门，没整头”，经过初步学习检查，却发现在这些所谓
    “没整头”的机关里，贪污现象也不少，使大家大吃一惊。这些动员和报告，也使广大党外人士认识到当前开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的重要意义和毛主席领导的英明。山西省协商委员会扩大会上，有些代表反映：“大张旗鼓镇压了反革命，又大张旗鼓反贪污，把里里外外的烂东西都去掉了，国家事就更好办了。”有些代表当场揭发了某些机关团体中存在的贪污浪费现象，并表示积极地参加这一群众性的运动。这种普遍深入的思想动员，使党内外广大干部群众明确认识了这一运动的严重意义，为进一步开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动作了良好的开端。
    为领导好这个规模广大的群众运动，各省市和部分专区都成立了包括党内外负责干部和积极分子的精简节约检查委员会，中共山西省委员会并成立了专门研究和指导运动的办公室。各地根据当地具体情况提出开展运动的方法、原则，详细制订了开展这一运动的步骤和计划。山西、河北等地省级机关、团体都是以整风的方式进行。一般确定步骤为：作出计划，学习文件，联系实际，反省坦白，揭发检举，放手发扬民主，分别处理。各省并提出做到首长负责，亲自动手，层层带头，逐级深入。山西省国营公营厂矿将结合清理资产，核定资金，开展检查。各专区和县，一九五二年三月份以前都将召开一至二次各界人民代表会议，广泛发动群众检举揭发。中共山西省委员会并订出开展这一运动的四条纪律：一、不得压制民主；二、不得挟嫌报复，打击别人，抬高自己；三、不得假造证据欺骗组织；四、未经批准不得借故离开整风。平原、察哈尔、绥远等省也都依据本省情况拟订开展运动的步骤和计划。
    现在这一规模巨大的运动已在全区逐步展开，除山西省已集中省级二十五个单位的两千六百多干部进行整风外，各省市各机关、团体的党员干部，多以原机关为单位结合工作进行。现大部地区正开始学习文件、联系实际，进行思想酝酿和初步检查。预计一九五二年初，一个大张旗鼓、雷厉风行的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，将在全区广泛深入地展开。
