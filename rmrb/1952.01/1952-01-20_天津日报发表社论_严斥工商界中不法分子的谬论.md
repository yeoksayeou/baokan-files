Tianjin Daily Publishes Editorial
Sternly Criticizing Erroneous Arguments of Illegal Elements in Business and Industry

Tianjin Daily published an editorial on the 15th entitled "The City's Industrial and Commercial Circles Actively Mobilize to Launch a Movement Against Bribery, Tax Evasion, and Fraudulent Seizure of State Property." This editorial severely refuted several fallacies fabricated by some illegal elements in Tianjin's business and industry circles to resist this movement.

The mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in Tianjin has now entered a high tide, with a very large scale and increasingly fierce momentum. More than 50,000 staff members of government organizations are participating in the movement, and many with unclean hands have already confessed their problems. Hundreds of thousands of workers have bravely taken action, and shop assistants have reported more than 14,000 cases of illegal merchants bribing, evading taxes, and defrauding state property in just a few days. Citizens and students have also begun to join the battle, and many moving deeds have emerged, such as wives mobilizing their corrupt husbands to confess and sons persuading their bribing fathers to confess. A movement against bribery, tax evasion, and fraudulent seizure of state property has also been launched in business and industry circles, and many people have taken the lead in self-criticism. However, there are still many illegal merchants who are snooping around, listening for news, still trying to play tricks, and putting on a show. Some are even creating various "theories" and spreading them around, attempting to create a kind of "public opinion" to cover up their mistakes, prevent others from confessing, and undermine this movement.

One fallacy in business and industry circles is: "The 'Three-Anti' movement is an internal affair of the Communist Party and the People's Government. How can it 'anti' us?" The editorial refuted this argument, saying: If we don't oppose you, then we must oppose you. This is because you are not only closely related to corruption and waste, but are often directly responsible for these criminal acts. As everyone knows, corruption, waste, and bureaucracy will not arise in the proletariat itself. The reason why they have arisen today is the result of the influence of bourgeois ideology. Therefore, to completely eradicate corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, we must use the method of "drawing firewood from under the cauldron" to eliminate the corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie. The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is essentially a resolute counterattack against the rampant attacks launched by the bourgeoisie against the working class and the Chinese Communist Party, and against revolutionary workers over the past three years.

"The policy of the People's Democratic United Front has changed!" The editorial said in refuting this fallacy: The policy has not changed. The united front between the working class and the bourgeoisie has always been a policy of both unity and struggle. In economics, we have a policy of uniting with the bourgeoisie's enthusiasm for developing production; at the same time, we have a policy of struggling against the bourgeoisie's speculation, manipulation, and sabotage of government decrees and economic plans. Ideologically, we recognize the legitimate status of bourgeois ideology in the period of New Democracy. At the same time, we must criticize the backward and corrupt parts of its ideology, point out its harm to the cause of people's democracy, and strive for and consolidate the leading position of working-class ideology. If there is any difference between today and the past three years, it is only that we have become vigilant against the corrosive effect of bourgeois corrupt ideology, and at the same time, we hope that they will consciously carry out self-transformation in order to develop smoothly in the New Democratic society.

"Cadres are revolutionary, and business and industry people have less education, so they can only implement policies to 60%, and it cannot be required of business and industry circles to implement policies 100%." Regarding this so-called "special theory of business and industry circles," the editorial criticized: Obeying the leadership of the working class, cherishing public property, severely punishing corruption, and banning speculation are all clearly stipulated in the Common Program, and the Common Program was jointly passed by the representatives of the four revolutionary classes and unanimously supported by everyone! Government cadres must earnestly implement the policies and decrees of the People's Government, and all citizens must also implement them 100%. No one can be an exception. It is a fact that some people in business and industry have less political education. Precisely because of this, we hope that they can be educated and transformed in this movement.

"Bribery is a custom, it has been like this since ancient times." This is another fallacy. The editorial sharply pointed out: This is a bad habit brought by the exploiting classes from the old society. The purpose of this "habit" is nothing else but to harm others and benefit oneself, engage in embezzlement, and seek exorbitant profits. Therefore, today we must reverse this bad habit that harms the country and the people and corrupts revolutionary cadres.

"Bribery is compelled, and bribery and accepting bribes cannot be equated." Tianjin Daily analyzed: Most bribery is done proactively by illegal merchants. Because everyone knows that in the old liberated areas, ordinary people did not have bad ideas and bad styles of corruption, but after entering the city, some cadres became corrupted because of the attacks by illegal merchants using sugar-coated bullets. The purpose of these illegal merchants' bribery is to entice cadres to steal a large amount of state property. "If you want to take something, you must first give something," this is the basic method of illegal merchants to make a fortune.

"Officials don't punish those who give gifts, and it's really difficult to do business today." This absurd statement maliciously confuses the People's Government with the reactionary governments of the past. Tianjin Daily solemnly pointed out: During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, corruption was inseparable from politics. At that time, "officials" not only did not punish those who gave gifts, but those who did not give gifts would definitely be "punished" by the "officials." The staff of the People's Government are servants who serve the people. Cleanliness, simplicity, and hard work are their proper qualities. Giving gifts and bribes to them is illegal. "It's really difficult to do business today" is indeed the case for those illegal merchants who are accustomed to bribery and use it to defraud money, but for legitimate business and industry people, business will be even better in the future.

In addition, there are some rumors, such as the "conviction for offering tea" theory, etc. Some people say: "If a cadre comes to you to buy goods, and you offer him tea and cigarettes, it is considered bribery and you will be punished." The editorial rebuked this statement. The editorial pointed out: Those who say these things are either suffering from naivety or are ambitious people trying to disrupt people's minds. The editorial said: Offering tea and cigarettes is a normal social courtesy and should not be regarded as bribery. Even if there is a small amount of bribery, the purpose is only to win over customers, not to defraud state property. As long as they reform these bad habits, they will no longer be investigated. In short, the People's Government has a policy of uniting with upright business and industry people; for those who have some shortcomings, as long as they can recognize their mistakes and are determined to correct them, the People's Government is willing to help them transform happily; only those illegal merchants who insist on their mistakes are the targets of resolute attack.

Finally, the editorial wrote: Now the confession and reporting movement of the Communist Party organizations, the People's Government, people's organizations, and various enterprise departments has entered a high tide, with an unstoppable momentum. Tens of thousands of confession and reporting materials are all related to business and industry circles. The current question is: Should the business and industry circles deeply carry out the confession and reporting movement, happily and actively wash away the dirt on their bodies, and carry out a profound self-transformation? Or should they insist on their mistakes and be spurned by the people? There is no third way to go. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 天津日报发表社论  严斥工商界中不法分子的谬论

    天津日报发表社论
    严斥工商界中不法分子的谬论
    天津日报十五日发表了一篇题为“全市工商业者积极行动起来，开展反行贿、反偷税、反诈骗国家财产运动”的社论。这篇社论严厉驳斥了天津工商界中一部分不法分子为了抗拒这一运动而制造出来的几种谬论。
    天津市群众性的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动现在已开始进入高潮，规模十分宏大，气势日趋猛烈。参加运动的机关工作人员有五万多人，其中许多手脚不净的分子已经交代了自己的问题。数十万工人已经勇敢地行动起来，店员们在几天之内就检举了一万四千多件不法商人行贿、偷税、诈骗国家财产的行为。市民和学生也开始投入战斗，出现了许多动人的事迹，如妻子动员贪污的丈夫坦白，儿子劝告行贿的父亲坦白等等。工商界中也开展了反行贿、反偷税、反诈骗国家财产的运动，许多人已带头进行了自我检讨。但是目前仍有不少不法商人到处探头探脑，打听风声，犹图玩弄阴谋，装模做样，有些人更制造出各式各样的“理论”，传播出去，企图造成一种“舆论”，用以掩盖自己的错误，阻挠别人坦白，来破坏这一运动。
    工商界中的一种谬论是：“‘三反’运动是共产党和人民政府内部的事，怎么‘反’到我们头上来了？”社论驳斥这种论调说：不反则已，要反一定要反到你们头上。这是因为你们不但与贪污浪费行为有密切的关系，而且常是这些犯罪行为的直接责任者。如大家所知道的，贪污、浪费及官僚主义，在无产阶级自身是不会产生的，今天所以产生了，是资产阶级思想影响的结果。因此，要彻底铲除贪污、浪费和官僚主义，就必须以“釜底抽薪”的办法，连同资产阶级这种腐朽思想一齐反掉。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，本质上就是对于资产阶级在三年以来向着工人阶级和中国共产党，向着革命的工作人员所举行的猖狂进攻，来一个坚决的反攻。
    “人民民主统一战线的方针变了！”社论在驳斥这种谬论时说：方针并没有变。工人阶级和资产阶级的统一战线从来就是又团结又斗争的政策。在经济上，我们对于资产阶级的发展生产的积极性，是联合的政策；而对资产阶级投机操纵、破坏政府法令与经济计划的行为，则又是斗争的政策。在思想上，我们承认资产阶级思想在新民主主义时期内的合法地位，同时，必须批判其思想中落后的腐朽的部分，指出它对于人民民主事业的危害性，并力争与巩固工人阶级领导思想的地位。如果说今天与过去三年有什么不同，只是我们对资产阶级腐朽思想的侵蚀作用警惕了起来，同时希望他们自觉地进行自我改造，以便在新民主主义社会中顺利发展。
    “干部是革命的，工商业者受的教育少，只能百分之六十地执行政策，不能要求工商界百分之百地执行政策。”对于这种所谓“工商界特殊论”，社论批驳道：服从工人阶级的领导、爱护公共财产、严惩贪污、取缔投机等等，在共同纲领中都有明文规定，而共同纲领是四个革命阶级的代表人物共同举手通过的，大家一致拥护的！人民政府的政策法令，工作干部固然要认真执行，全体国民也必须百分之百去执行，任何人也不能例外。有的工商业者受的政治教育少，这是事实，正因为这样，所以更希望他们在这一运动中，能够得到教育，得到改造。
    “行贿是习惯，自古已然。”这是另一种谬论。社论尖锐地指出：这是剥削阶级从旧社会带来的坏习惯，这个“习惯”的目的不是为了别的，只是为了损人利己，营私舞弊，牟取暴利。因此，今天我们必须将这种祸国殃民、腐化革命干部的坏习惯反掉。
    “行贿是迫不得已，行贿与受贿不能同等论罪。”天津日报分析道：绝大部分的行贿是不法商人主动作的。因为大家知道：在老解放区，一般人员并没有贪污腐化的坏思想、坏作风，而是在入城以后，由于不法商人用糖衣炮弹来攻击，某些干部才腐化了的。这些不法商人行贿的目的，是为了勾引干部大量窃取国家财产。“将欲取之，必先予之”，这正是不法商人发横财的基本手法。
    “官不打送礼的，今天做生意真难。”这种荒唐的说法是把人民政府和过去的反动政府恶意地混淆了起来。天津日报严正指出：在国民党反动统治时期，贪污与政治密不可分。那时的“官”不仅不打送礼的，而且谁要是不送礼，必定受到“官”打。人民政府的工作人员是为人民服务的勤务员，廉洁、朴素、刻苦奉公是他们应有的品质。向他们送礼行贿是非法的。“今天做生意真难”，对那些惯于行贿、借以诈财的不法商人来说，确是如此，但对正当的工商业者来说，今后的生意则是更好做了。
    此外还有一些流言，如“敬茶处罪论”等等。有人说：“干部到你这里买货，你如敬以烟茶，就算做行贿、就要治罪。”社论斥责了这种说法。社论指出：讲这些话的人，如果不是幼稚病患者，就是野心分子企图扰乱人心。社论说：敬茶敬烟是属于普通应酬性的，不应以行贿论。即使有小量的行贿，其目的只是为了拉拢主顾，并非要诈骗国家财产，只要他们改革此类陋规，也可不再追究。总之，人民政府对正派的工商业者，是团结的方针；对那些有些缺点的人，只要他们能认识错误，决心改正错误，人民政府愿意帮助他们愉快地进行改造；只有那些坚持错误的不法商人，才是坚决打击的对象。
    最后，社论写道：现在共产党的组织、人民政府、人民团体、各个企业部门的坦白检举运动已经进入高潮，气势猛不可当，上万件的坦白、检举材料，都牵连到工商界身上。目前的问题是：是工商业界深入地开展坦白检举运动，愉快地主动地洗掉身上的肮脏，进行一次深刻的自我改造呢？还是要坚持错误，遭到人民的唾弃呢？再也没有第三条路可走了。（新华社）
