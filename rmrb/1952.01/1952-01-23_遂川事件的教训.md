    Lessons from the Suichuan Incident

    The serious incident of the majority of members of the Chinese Communist Party's Suichuan County Committee in Jiangxi Province degenerating and becoming corrupt demonstrates that the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets can not only conquer individual party cadres with weak wills, but can also transform a county-level leading organ of the Party into a corrupt clique. This is something we must be seriously vigilant about.

    Under the control of degenerates like Jiao Ergong, the CCP Suichuan County Committee openly stole state property, violated policies and decrees, and even shielded counter-revolutionaries, causing the Party organization to become disorganized and fall apart. In this situation, the rogue speculator Wang Zhirong acted recklessly and unscrupulously. There was not a trace of the Communist Party spirit left! According to Article 64 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China, such a corrupt group controlled by wreckers must be immediately "removed from its leading organ." If such a rotten abscess as the Suichuan County Committee is not resolutely cut off and allowed to spread, it will cause even greater losses to the Party and the people. Lenin said in "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" that "the strictest discipline of the proletariat is one of the fundamental conditions for the proletariat to defeat the bourgeoisie." Therefore, strictly enforcing Party discipline and resolutely removing alien elements and incorrigible opportunists from our ranks in order to maintain the Party's ideological and political purity and unity is a revolutionary measure that must be resolutely taken to smash the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive, consolidate the Party's organization, and consolidate the victory of the revolution.

    The fact that most of the members of the Party's leading organ in Suichuan County have fallen to such an irreparable level is, of course, primarily due to the impurity of the county committee's organization and the poor quality of some cadres; but on the other hand, it is also caused by the bureaucratic work style of the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Committee, especially the Ji'an Prefectural Committee. Therefore, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee and the Ji'an Prefectural Committee should bear certain responsibility for the errors of the Suichuan County Party organization. As early as two years ago, some cadres sent to work in Suichuan had impure motives, saying, "We came from the Northeast, so far away, what is it for? What does it matter if we eat and drink a little." Why didn't the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Committee, especially the CCP Ji'an Prefectural Committee, prevent and correct this serious corrupt thought in advance? Since the CCP Ji'an Prefectural Committee had already discovered some errors of the Suichuan County Committee last March, why didn't it conduct in-depth inspections and timely handling? These lessons are very painful, and it is hoped that the relevant Party leading organs will seriously summarize this lesson, conduct a profound self-examination, and struggle to cleanse all bourgeois filth.

    遂川事件的教训
    中共江西遂川县委员会大部分成员蜕化变质的严重事件说明，资产阶级的糖衣炮弹，不仅可以征服个别意志不坚定的党员干部，而且可以使党的一个县级领导机关变成为腐化集团，这是值得我们严重警惕的。
    中共遂川县委员会在蜕化变质分子焦尔恭等把持下，公然盗窃国家财产，违反政策法令，甚至包庇反革命分子，使党的组织涣散，四分五裂。在这种情况下，流氓投机分子王志荣就肆无忌惮，胡作乱为。这那里还有一点点共产党的气味！对于这种破坏分子所把持的腐朽集团，根据中国共产党党章第六十四条规定，必须立即“撤销其领导机关”。对于像遂川县委这样腐烂的脓疮，如果不坚决割掉，而任其蔓延，则将会给党和人民造成更大的损失。列宁在“左派幼稚病”中说过“无产阶级底最严格的纪律，乃是无产阶级战胜资产阶级的基本条件之一”。因此，严肃党的纪律，坚决清除自己队伍中的异己分子及不可救药的机会主义分子出党，以保持党在思想上政治上的纯洁和统一，是粉碎资产阶级的猖狂进攻，巩固党的组织，巩固革命胜利所必须坚决采取的革命措施。
    遂川县党的领导机关的大部分成员堕落到如此不可救药的地步，当然首先是因为县委员会组织不纯，部分干部品质恶劣；但另一方面，也是由于中共江西省委特别是吉安地委的官僚主义作风所造成的。因此江西省委和吉安地委应对遂川县党组织的错误负一定的责任。早在两年以前，派往遂川工作的某些干部就存在着不纯的动机，说“我们从东北来，这末远，是为的什么，吃点喝点有什么关系。”对于这种严重的腐朽的思想，为什么中共江西省委特别是中共吉安地委不预为防止、及时纠正呢？前年三月，中共吉安地委既然已经发现了遂川县委的一些错误，又为什么不深入检查及时处理呢？这些教训是十分令人沉痛的，希望有关的党的领导机关认真总结这一教训，深刻地进行检讨，为清洗一切资产阶级的污毒而斗争。
