    Yingkou Knitting Factory
    Leading Cadres Did Not Rely on Workers; Production Increase and Economy Drive Results Decline Month by Month

    Editor: The leading cadres of the Yingkou Knitting Factory did not rely well on the worker masses, resulting in a month-by-month decline in production increase and economy drive results. After the production increase and economy drive movement was launched in the Yingkou Knitting Factory, the workers put forward specific suggestions, raising the monthly production increase and economy target from the equivalent of fifty tons of grain to seventy tons. Later, the factory's leading cadres, without consulting the workers, further raised the production increase and economy target to more than one hundred and thirty tons. As a result, the workers lost a clear goal to strive for. The factory's leading cadres also did not rely on the trade union. For example, the factory director once restricted trade union committee members from attending trade union meetings; while the administration, occupying production time, convened a workers' congress, but then required the workers to make up for the lost work hours afterward. It should be particularly pointed out that the administrative leading cadres completely disregard the welfare of the workers. The factory's dormitories are very small, and only some veteran workers can live in them. Other workers have to live far away from the factory, which is very inconvenient when it rains. The trade union chairman said to the factory director regarding this matter, "Our housing problem should be resolved as soon as possible." The factory director replied, "You, the trade union chairman, are really a problem. Can you find any houses?" The factory also does not run a nursery, and the workers' children sleep in a drafty little room, often catching colds and falling ill, which affects the workers' production enthusiasm. At the end of last November, the inspectors from the Labor Insurance Department of the Yingkou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions said to the factory director, "If there are enough of ten children, a nursery should be established." But the factory director deliberately concealed two children, claiming that there were nine instead of eleven. These unreasonable measures have greatly dampened the workers' enthusiasm for production. For example, in August of last year, the production increase and economy drive completed the equivalent of one hundred and eighty-nine tons of grain's worth of wealth, in September, more than eighty-nine tons were completed, but in October, only more than forty-eight tons were completed, causing great losses to state property.

### 营口针织厂  领导干部没有依靠工人增产节约成绩逐月下降

    营口针织厂
    领导干部没有依靠工人增产节约成绩逐月下降
    编辑同志：营口针织厂领导干部没有很好地依靠工人群众，致增产节约成绩逐月下降。增产节约运动在营口针织厂展开后，职工们纷纷提出具体意见，把每月增产节约相当于五十吨粮食的财富的计划提高到七十吨。后来厂里的领导干部不通过职工，又把增产节约计划提高到一百三十多吨。因此，工人们心中就没有了明确的奋斗目标。厂里领导干部也不依靠工会。比如，厂长曾限制工会委员参加工会会议；而行政方面占用生产时间，召开了职工大会后，却要职工在事后补工。应该特别提出的是，行政领导干部根本漠视职工的福利。这个厂的宿舍很小，能住宿舍的只是些老工人，其他工人只好住在离工厂很远的地方，每逢下雨，上班下班很不方便。工会主席为这件事对厂长说：“咱们的房子问题应该赶早解决。”厂长却回答说：“你这个工会主席真成问题，能找得着房子吗？”这个厂也不办托儿所，工人的小孩就睡在一间露风的小房子里，常常受凉生病，影响了工人的生产情绪。去年十一月底，营口市总工会劳动保险部检查人员曾对这个厂的厂长说：“如果够十个小孩，就应当成立托儿所。”但厂长故意隐瞒了两个小孩，把十一个说成九个。这些不合理的措施，大大打击了职工的生产热情，如去年八月份完成增产节约相当于一百八十九吨粮食的财富，九月份完成八十九吨多，十月份却只完成四十八吨多，使国家财产受到很大损失。
