Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 5th - The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa, including all commanders, fighters, and staff, have launched a large-scale production campaign and have now completed the first stage of their mission ahead of schedule. They have reclaimed over 2,300 mu of wasteland and chopped over 800,000 jin of firewood.

When the land reclamation teams first arrived at the construction site on the banks of the Lhasa River, the weather suddenly turned cold. The veterans, hardened by years of hardship, worked diligently in the open field, wielding hoes and shovels in temperatures of minus 15 degrees Celsius before dawn each day. Competition was organized between squads and individuals. The amount of land dug per person per day rapidly increased from two and a half fen to five and a half fen. In order to complete the task ahead of schedule, they worked about ten hours a day. Some worked from eight o'clock in the morning until twelve o'clock at night. The wasteland along the Lhasa River, which had been barren for many years, echoed with the labor songs of the People's Liberation Army from dawn to dusk. They successfully completed a month's plan in twelve days.

On the mountains over a hundred li east of Lhasa, firewood cutting teams cut firewood in the heavy wind and snow all day long. Even with their shoes and socks torn and their clothes ripped by branches and rocks, they remained undeterred by the wind and snow, carrying over a hundred jin of firewood down the mountain each day.

The news of the People's Liberation Army's labor and production quickly spread among the broad masses of Tibetan people. On the first day of land reclamation, groups of monks and laypeople surrounded the construction site to watch. When soldiers of a certain unit carried the mud that had accumulated for years in front of their residence to the fields as fertilizer, and transported stones from the fields back to pave the road in front of their residence, many Tibetan people were so moved that they voluntarily helped the People's Liberation Army carry mud and pave the road. Now, everywhere in Lhasa, one can hear monks and laypeople happily saying, "The People's Liberation Army is truly implementing the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet; in order to reduce our burden, they are producing as they said they would."

    驻拉萨的人民解放军
    完成第一步生产任务
    【新华社拉萨五日电】驻拉萨的人民解放军全体指挥员战斗员和机关工作人员展开大规模生产运动，现已提前完成第一步的任务。他们已开垦了两千三百多亩荒地和砍木柴八十多万斤。
    在开荒队伍刚到拉萨河畔的工地时，气候突然转寒。久经风霜的战士们，每天天还未亮就在摄氏零下十五度的旷野里，挥动锄锹紧张地劳动着。班与班、个人与个人互相展开竞赛。每人每天掘地由二分半迅速增加到五分半。为了提前完成任务，他们每天劳动十小时左右。有的从早晨八点钟一直工作到夜晚十二点钟。拉萨河畔荒芜了多年的土地上，从黎明到夜晚都响喨着解放军的劳动歌声。他们胜利地把一个月的计划在十二天内完成了。
    在拉萨以东一百多里的山上，砍柴队整天在大风雪中砍柴。鞋袜踏破了，衣服也被树枝崖石撕破了，他们仍然风雪无阻，每人每天把一百多斤重的柴背下山来。
    人民解放军劳动生产的消息，迅速在广大藏族人民中传播。开荒的第一天，就有成群的僧俗人民围着工地观看。当某部战士们把驻地门前成年累月积着的污泥，当作肥料，背到田里，并把田里的石子运回铺平门前的道路时，许多藏族人民被感动得自动帮助解放军挑泥铺路。现在在拉萨可以到处听见僧俗人民这样欢喜地说：“解放军真是完全执行和平解放西藏办法的协议的，为了要减轻我们的负担，说生产就生产。”
