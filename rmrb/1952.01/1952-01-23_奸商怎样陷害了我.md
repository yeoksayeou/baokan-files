    How a Cunning Merchant Framed Me
    Fan Ximing, Public Security Officer, Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau

    I am a public security officer from the Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, twenty-five years old this year, from a poor peasant background, joined the revolution in 1947, and am a Communist Party member. Since arriving in Shenyang, because my class consciousness was not high and I could not resist the bourgeoisie's corruption and decadent, licentious lifestyle, I was lured by cunning merchants using despicable means, and embarked on a path of corruption and degeneration, even to the point of once abandoning the revolution.

    In the past, I was a farmer. In 1947, during the land reform, my family was allocated three houses and four *qing* of land. Under the education and leadership of the Party, I joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In battles with the enemy, I always bravely advanced. At that time, I hated the enemy and was not afraid of death, let alone hardship. I still remember in one ambush battle in Xi'an County, our platoon was surrounded by a company of enemies. We charged forward and fought the enemy with bayonets. I stabbed three Chiang Kai-shek soldiers to death or wounded, and carried the injured platoon leader out of the encirclement. Thus, I had been awarded one major merit and two minor merits. In study and work, I was always conscientious and responsible. In June 1948, in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and the Party flag, I raised my hand and swore: to fight for the cause of communism to the end! However, under the bourgeoisie's frantic attack, and tempted and framed by cunning merchants, I failed to maintain my glorious revolutionary history and instead embarked on a path of corruption and degeneration.

    Last year, I was assisting with the inspection of vehicles and issuing licenses in the Traffic Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. I was often in contact with merchants and began to envy their decadent and hedonistic lifestyle. During the vehicle inspection work, I met Ren Fengtong, the captain of a private transportation motorcade. His three vehicles were dilapidated and, according to regulations, unqualified. Ren Fengtong then used the despicable means typical of cunning merchants, flattering me, fawning over me, and trying to soften me up, asking me to issue him licenses. Initially, he would take me to teahouses to listen to storytellers during my work breaks. When it got dark, he would tug at my sleeve and say, "Let's go, brother, let's go to a small restaurant to eat something, it's nothing!" Once, he ran into me on the street and insisted on taking me to eat. At first, I didn't want to go, but he dragged me along and even hired a rickshaw. At that time, I was a little hesitant, but then I thought: It's okay to eat a meal, as long as I don't take bribes. If the organization finds out, at most I'll get a scolding. So I went half-willingly.

    From then on, the cunning merchant Ren Fengtong seized my weakness and intensified his efforts to win me over, inviting me to watch operas, take baths, listen to *dagu* (a form of Chinese narrative singing), and visit Beiling Park. When he learned that I was not yet married, he even offered to introduce me to someone. Thus, from ordinary restaurants, I was taken to restaurants with female waitresses, all paid for by Ren Fengtong. He said, "Good friends, it doesn't matter who pays." This blinded me, and I regarded him as a "good friend." Once, he invited me to a restaurant with female waitresses in the North Market. After eating, he pulled a trick, hiring three cars to take me and the female waitresses to his house, and cleared out a room for me. At that time, I was blinded by this extravagant bourgeois lifestyle and fell into the trap of the cunning merchant. Then, Ren Fengtong asked me to issue licenses for his unqualified vehicles, and I quickly issued them to him.

    Under the cunning merchant's enticement and bribery, I was severely infected with bourgeois corruption and hedonistic thinking, and I was constantly muddled and my head was full of eating, drinking, and having fun. I even felt that revolutionary work was "tense" and "too hard," and that criticism and self-criticism were not "free." I had no interest in work, couldn't talk to my comrades, and was half-hearted about the revolution, not at ease in my work. When others criticized me, I just gave perfunctory replies. I thought, I should buy a car myself, and since I know how to drive, I could become a businessman like Ren Fengtong, with money and enjoyment, how wonderful!

    Because I had done something "wrong," I was always feeling guilty, and I felt as if my secret had been discovered by the organization. I also heard that Party rectification was about to begin, and I was a little flustered. I was afraid of being expelled from the Party, afraid of losing face, afraid of being punished, and afraid of being sentenced. When comrades talked, I became suspicious: "Are they talking about me?" When there was a group meeting, I felt guilty and thought: "Is it probably to discuss my problem?" At this time, the internal struggle was very intense, and sometimes I even thought about committing suicide in the Hun River. Then, the cunning merchant Ren Fengtong said to me again, "If the superiors know about what we did, they will definitely punish us!" (He hinted that I should find another way out.) I felt that he was truly "helping" me like an "old friend," so I made up my mind. Then, the Public Security Bureau held a large meeting, which all officers had to attend. I was extremely afraid and couldn't sleep all night, tossing and turning. I figured that this meeting must be held for me. I thought I couldn't stay here any longer, so I put on plain clothes and deserted, going from wavering to abandoning the revolution.

    My plan at that time was to go home and sell my house and land to buy a car and become a businessman. But after I escaped home, I saw my elderly parents living a happy life, and the farmers in the whole village were also actively engaged in production. At this time, I felt extremely pained. I thought of the Party's education of me over the past four years, and of my glorious fighting history in the Liberation War! The more I thought about it, the more I felt that taking the cunning merchant's path was a dead end! I regretted that I had made an unforgivable mistake in the past, and I realized that I had been framed by the cunning merchant. If it hadn't been for Ren Fengtong's enticement and bribery, I would not have made such a mistake. But then I thought: It's too late to regret it, and I don't dare to go back to the Public Security Bureau. At this time, I hated the cunning merchant Ren Fengtong for framing me. I thought: If I don't go back, I can't run away anywhere. There is only one way to confess and repent, to start over! Thinking further into the future, I realized that only revolution is the only bright path. So, after a fierce ideological struggle, I ran back to the Public Security Bureau and confessed this ugly sin of betraying the people to the organization from beginning to end. I turned back from the abyss and climbed ashore. The revolution gave me a new life.

    Today, I am determined to confess my sins to the people, eliminate the dirty thoughts of the bourgeoisie, and ask the superiors to give me the punishment I deserve. I also want to tell everyone this painful lesson: In order to pursue huge profits, the bourgeoisie uses all despicable means to harm us and attack us. I earnestly hope that all comrades will be fully vigilant and resolutely fight back against this base attack by the bourgeoisie, and quickly report grafters and bribers!

    奸商怎样陷害了我
    沈阳市人民政府公安局公安员　范喜明
    我是沈阳市人民政府公安局的公安人员，今年二十五岁，贫农出身，一九四七年参加革命，是共产党员。我自从到了沈阳以后，因为自己阶级觉悟不高，经不起资产阶级的腐化、堕落、淫靡生活的诱惑，在奸商以卑鄙手段拉拢下，走上了腐化堕落的道路，甚至一度脱离了革命。
    过去我是一个农民。一九四七年土地改革时，我家分了三间房子、四垧地。在党的教育领导下，我参加了中国人民解放军，在和敌人作战中，我每次都是勇敢地前进。那时，我仇恨敌人，连死都不怕，更不怕吃苦了。我还记得在西安县一次堵击战中，我们一排人被一连敌人包围住。我们就冲上去和敌人拚刺刀，我一连挑死、挑伤了三个蒋匪军，背着受伤的排长冲出重围。这样，曾经立过一大功，两小功。在学习上、工作上，从来是认真负责的。一九四八年六月，我在毛主席像前，在党旗前面，举手宣誓：要为共产主义事业奋斗到底！但是，在资产阶级疯狂进攻下，受到奸商的引诱和陷害，我没有保持住自己光荣的革命历史，竟走上了腐化堕落的道路。
    去年我在市公安局交通科帮助作检查车辆，发放牌照的工作，经常和商人接触，就开始羡慕他们腐朽享乐的生活。在车辆检查工作中，认识了私营搬运汽车队队长任凤同。他的汽车有三辆破烂不堪，按规定是不合格的。任凤同就使出他们奸商惯有的卑鄙手段，恭维我，奉承我，软化我，叫我给他发牌照。最初，他趁着我工作休息时间，拉我到茶社去听说书，天黑了，他就拉着我的衣袖说：“走吧，兄弟，到小馆去吃点，没啥！”有一次他在街上碰见我，硬拉着我去吃饭，我起初想不去，他硬拉我去，还雇了三轮车。当时我有点犹豫不定，又一想：吃点饭也没什么，我不受贿就行，组织上知道了，顶多是批评一顿。就半推半就地去了。
    从这以后，奸商任凤同抓住了我的弱点，就越发进行拉拢，请我看戏、洗澡、听大鼓、逛北陵。当他知道我还没有结婚时，还要给我介绍对象。这样，从普通饭馆子，走进女招待饭馆子，都是任凤同花钱。他说：“好朋友，谁花谁的，都没有关系。”这样蒙蔽了我的眼睛，拿他当作“好朋友”。有一次他请我到北市场有女招待的饭馆去吃饭，吃完后他使出个花招，雇了三辆车，把我和女招待都拉到他家去住，并给我腾出一间房子来。我当时被这花天酒地的资产阶级生活给迷瞎了眼睛，上了奸商的圈套。这时，任凤同要我给他的不合格的汽车发牌照，我就很快地给他发了。
    在奸商的拉拢、利诱下，我已严重地沾染了资产阶级的腐化享乐思想，成天昏昏沉沉，满脑袋是吃喝玩乐。我竟感到革命工作“紧张”、“太苦”，还有批评与自我批评，不“自由”。我无心思工作，和同志们说不来，对革命抱着两条心，工作不安心。别人批评我，我就应付。我想，我也买上一辆汽车，自己又会开，和任凤同一样当个商人，又有钱，又享乐，有多好啊！
    因为自己做了“亏心事”，心里老是发虚，我感到好像自己的秘密被组织上发觉了。又听说要开始整党，我的心里有点着慌，我怕被开除党籍，怕丢人，怕受处分，怕判徒刑。同志们谈话，我就发疑：“是不是在议论我呢？”要开小组会，我心虚地想：“恐怕是讨论我的问题吧？”这时心里斗争的非常激烈，有时又想到浑河去自杀。这时，奸商任凤同又对我说：“咱俩过去的事，上级若是知道了，非处分不可呀！”（他暗示我另找出路）我觉得他真像“老朋友”一样地“帮助”我，我就把主意打定了。接着公安局开大会，全体员警都得参加，我害怕极了，翻来复去一晚上也没有睡着觉，我捉摸这个大会一定是为我开的。我想我再也不能在这里待下去了，于是我穿上便衣，开了小差，由动摇到脱离了革命。
    我那时的打算是回家卖房子、卖地来买汽车当商人。但是我逃回家以后，看到了年迈双亲过着快乐的生活，全村农民也在积极生产。这时，我痛心极了。我想到四年来党对自己的教育，想到自己在解放战争中的光荣斗争历史！越想越觉得：走奸商的路是一条死路！自己后悔过去不该犯了不可饶恕的错误，也就认识到自己是受了奸商的陷害。如果没有奸商任凤同的拉拢利诱，我不会犯这样的错误。但这时又想：后悔也晚了，不敢回到公安局来。我这时十分痛恨奸商任凤同陷害了我。我想：不回去，到那里也跑不了，只有坦白悔过的一条路，重新作人！再往将来一想：只有革命才是唯一的光明出路。于是，在激烈的思想斗争后，我就跑回公安局，把这段背叛人民的丑恶罪过，从头到尾向组织上坦白了。我从万丈深坑里回过头来，爬到岸上。革命使我得到了新生。
    今天，我痛下决心向人民坦白我的罪过，清除资产阶级的肮脏思想，请求上级给我以应得的处分。我还要把我这段沉痛的教训，告诉给大家：资产阶级为了追求暴利，他们采用一切卑鄙的手段坑害我们，向我们进攻。我恳切地希望全体同志都要充分警惕起来，把资产阶级这种卑劣的进攻坚决打下去，赶快检举贪污分子和行贿分子！（原载东北日报）
