Respected Chairman Mao:
    Now, I am reporting to you the situation after returning from Beijing, as a gift to celebrate the New Year for you. After participating in the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I left Beijing and returned to Ping顺 [Píngshùn] County, Shanxi. Based on the various reports of this meeting, especially your opening remarks, I gave twelve reports in Taiyuan, Taigu, and Ping顺, one after another. Approximately 18,000 cadres, workers, peasants, students, citizens, and industrialists and businessmen heard my reports. After hearing my reports, everyone unanimously expressed that they would resolutely respond to your call for increasing production and practicing economy. More than 1,000 mutual aid teams in Ping顺 County have formulated specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy; and more than 100 mutual aid teams have challenged the agricultural production cooperative I lead to launch a patriotic production increase and economy competition.
    After returning to the village, I started to reorganize the mutual aid group I led, upgrading the mutual aid group to an agricultural production cooperative, further utilizing the potential capabilities of labor, animal power, and land to expand reproduction; at the same time, I formulated a plan for increasing production and practicing economy. We had been brewing the issue of upgrading the mutual aid group to an agricultural production cooperative last spring, and this time it was discussed for another half month. Under the general demand of the masses, we learned from the experience of Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in 川底 [Chuāndǐ] Village, and invited labor model Guo Yu'en to give a report. Everyone felt very good after listening to the report, and unanimously believed that only by organizing agricultural production cooperatives can agricultural production be further developed. We adopted a voluntary participation method, and now 21 households have joined, accounting for 42 percent of the total number of households in the village. The land contributed to the cooperative is 162.5 mu, and there are 26 male and female laborers. Among the members who joined the cooperative, there are 9 party members, 4 members of the Communist Youth League, and 7 village cadres. We held the first meeting of the participating households on December 10 and formally established the agricultural production cooperative. In order to respond to your call to "increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," we held a general meeting of all members of the cooperative on December 11. After discussion, the entire cooperative unanimously agreed to launch a production increase and economy campaign on the basis of the bumper harvest in 1951. We have formulated a production increase and economy plan. We require that the average yield of grain per mu in 1952 be 395 jin, an increase of 25 jin per mu compared to 1951, exceeding 117 percent of the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan production level per mu. We will also strive to have 15 mu of high-yield land in the entire cooperative: 10 mu planted with Golden Queen corn, requiring a yield of 1,000 jin per mu; and 5 mu planted with millet, requiring a yield of 600 jin per mu, creating a collective high-yield record. According to the characteristics of the mountain economy, we must vigorously develop forestry and animal husbandry production. This is the main direction of our efforts in the future. We plan to buy a breeding livestock and 30 sheep for the entire cooperative in 1952, and to breed 8 heads of livestock and 20 sheep to solve the fertilizer shortage. At the same time, we plan to replant alfalfa in some sloping terraces to solve the forage shortage. In addition, we will plant 1,000 dry fruit trees such as walnuts, apricots, and mountain peaches, 500 timber trees, and afforest 100 mu. We plan to extract five surplus laborers from the entire cooperative in 1952 to work as mud and water workers outside, which can earn 8,000 jin of millet. In winter, we mainly focus on doing all the preparatory work.
    In terms of economy: everyone has formulated six economy plans: 1. Cooperative members should spend less money on weddings and funerals, and reduce the amount of money spent on entertaining guests and giving gifts. 2. Pay attention to the storage of seeds and grains and prevent rats from eating and insects from eroding. 3. Invest surplus grain in reproduction or save it in the bank. 4. Prepare for meetings, overcome the phenomenon of lengthy meetings that do not solve problems and waste labor. 5. Overcome the phenomenon of wasting labor and animal power, and strictly implement the work evaluation and work point system. 6. Promote diligence and thrift, and manage household affairs in a planned way.
    After the plan was formulated, 12 cooperative members have requested to invest 1,176 jin of grain in the cooperative to expand reproduction. Cooperative member Wang Shize originally planned to hold a big full moon celebration for his little grandson, spending three shi of millet. After this production increase and economy plan was formulated, he only used 14 jin of white flour to get things done, saving two shi and two dou of millet.
    Chairman Mao, I guarantee that under your wise leadership, I will redouble my efforts in production, humbly learn from the masses, strive to play a model role in various tasks, and strive for a bumper harvest in 1952. I must maintain the glorious title of "Labor Model."
                    Respectfully wishing
    You good health
            Respectfully,
            Li Shunda, Labor Model of Ping顺 [Píngshùn] County, Shanxi Province
                    December 25, 1951
                            (Written on behalf of by Shen Yuanze and Niu Manhui)

    一定按照山地经济特点发展林牧业
    ——农业劳动模范李顺达给毛主席的贺年信敬爱的毛主席：
    现在，我把赴北京回来后的情况，报告给您，作为我向您庆贺新年的献礼。我参加中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议后，即离北京返回山西平顺。我根据这次会议的各项报告，特别是您的开会词，先后在太原、太谷、平顺作了十二次传达报告。听到我传达的干部、工人、农民、学生、市民、工商业者约有一万八千余人。听了我的传达后，大家一致表示要坚决响应您的增产节约的号召。平顺县已有一千多个互助小组，订出了增产节约具体计划；并有一百多个互助组，向我所领导的农业生产合作社应战，要展开爱国增产节约竞赛。
    我回到村里后，就着手改组我领导的互助组，使互助组提高为农业生产合作社，进一步发挥劳力、畜力和土地的潜在能力，扩大再生产；同时订立了增产节约计划。对互助组提高为农业生产合作社的问题，我们今年春天就曾经酝酿过，这次又经过半个月讨论。在群众普遍要求下，我们学习了川底村郭玉恩农业生产合作社的经验，并请劳动模范郭玉恩作了报告。大家听了报告，都感到很好，一致认为只有组织农业生产合作社，才能使农业生产更向前发展一步。我们采取自愿入社的方式，现在入社的已有二十一户，占全村总户数的百分之四十二。入社土地一百六十二亩五分，男女劳力二十六个。入社的成员中，有党员九人，团员四人，村干部七人。我们在十二月十日召开了首次入社户会议，正式成立了农业生产合作社。为了响应你“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，十二月十一日召开了全体社员大会，经过讨论，全社一致通过要在一九五一年丰产基础上，开展增产节约运动。我们已经制订了增产节约计划。我们要求一九五二年每亩平均产粮三百九十五斤，比一九五一年每亩增产二十五斤，超过抗日战争前每亩生产水平的百分之一百一十七。并争取全社有十五亩丰产地：十亩种金皇后玉茭，要求每亩产一千斤；五亩种谷子，每亩产六百斤，创造集体丰产纪录。根据山地经济的特点，我们要大力发展林牧业生产。这是我们今后努力的主要方向。我们计划在一九五二年全社合伙购买种畜一头，羊三十只，要繁殖牲畜八头，羊二十只，解决肥料困难。同时计划在一部分坡地梯田中改种苜蓿，解决牧草困难。此外，要种核桃、杏、山桃等干果树一千株，木材树五百株，造林一百亩。我们计划在一九五二年全社抽出五个剩余劳力，出外做泥水工，可赚小米八千斤。在冬季我们主要是做好一切准备工作。
    在节约方面：大家订出了六项节约计划：一、社员办红白喜事要少花钱，请客送礼要减少。二、重视保管种籽和粮食、防止鼠吃虫蚀。三、把余粮投入再生产或储蓄到银行。四、开会要有准备，克服会议拖拉，不解决问题的浪费劳力现象。五、克服浪费劳、畜力的现象，严格评工折工制度。六、提倡勤劳节俭，有计划地经营家务。
    计划订出以后，已有十二户社员要求把一千一百七十六斤粮食投资到社内扩大再生产。社员王狮则原来计划给他小孙子办大满月，花费小米三石。在这次订增产节约计划后，他只用了十四斤白面，就把事情办过了，节约了小米二石二斗。
    毛主席，我保证在您的英明领导下，加倍积极生产，虚心向群众学习，争取在各种工作中起模范作用，争取一九五二年丰收。我一定要保持住“劳动模范”的光荣称号。
                    敬祝
    您身体健康
            山西省平顺县劳动模范李顺达敬上
                    一九五一年十二月二十五日
                            （申元则、牛满会代笔）
