The Experience of Zhejiang Province in Investigating the Major Embezzlement Case of Fang Lantian and Others Proves That the Anti-Corruption Movement Must Deeply Mobilize the Masses.
The combination of top-down inspection and mass reporting ultimately brought the embezzlement elements who attempted to conceal themselves to justice.
The People's Supervision Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government, in its inspection of the Zhejiang Construction Company Timber Mill, a state-owned enterprise, uncovered a major case of embezzlement, dereliction of duty, and theft of state property by Fang Lantian, Zhang Xiufeng, and Teng Shaoqing, three individuals from the Tonglu Purchasing Office of the mill, through extensive mobilization and reliance on the masses. This fact fully demonstrates that combining top-down organized inspections with widespread mobilization of the masses for bottom-up reporting is a crucial key to carrying out the anti-corruption movement.

Early Inspections Separated from the Masses Yielded Little Results
When the inspection team of the People's Supervision Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government initially arrived at the Zhejiang Construction Company and its affiliated timber mill, they were not very clear about the policy of mobilizing and relying on the masses. At that time, due to poor coordination between the inspection team and the organizational and administrative leadership of the inspected agency, as well as a lack of close contact with the mill's employees, and the fact that some of the timber mill's staff members viewed "their own mill" as separate from the state, not understanding how to be responsible to the state, and failing to recognize that corruption and waste were the biggest enemies of the production increase and conservation movement, the work encountered many obstacles. Some people wanted to safeguard the "face" of their own unit, or were unaccustomed to the word "inspection," adopting an irresponsible or impatient attitude towards this struggle. For example, Sun Tongmao, the deputy chief of the mill's business section, had been working at the mill since its establishment in June 1950 and was relatively familiar with the situation, but he adopted an evasive attitude towards the inspection team, thinking, "I am not corrupt, I don't need to worry about other people's affairs." Deputy Director Shen Pengcai also impatiently said, "Why hasn't the inspection team left yet?" Some staff members who felt they had problems with their thinking, work style, and other aspects adopted a confrontational attitude, attempting to "surround" and "blockade" the inspection team. For example, after worker Shi Baicai reported a situation to the inspection team, he was called for a "private conversation" by a certain section chief, who said to Shi Baicai, "If you have opinions, talk to our leaders, why report to the inspection team?" This created a phenomenon where ordinary employees dared not approach the inspection team. Employees had three concerns when reporting situations to the inspection team: first, fear of losing their jobs; second, fear of offending the leaders and having their salaries reduced; and third, probationary employees feared not being hired. Therefore, the inspection work was greatly hindered, and no results were achieved for half a month.

Mobilizing Employees to Report Led to the Discovery of Case Leads
Based on the above situation, the inspection team re-examined the inspection work and clarified the policy: to maintain close contact with the relevant agencies, conduct extensive publicity and education among employees, and mobilize and rely on employees to discover problems. The inspection team and the leaders of the Construction Company re-examined the inspection work and absorbed three comrades from the Construction Company to assist in the inspection. Liu Shaowen, the deputy manager of the Construction Company, gave a special mobilization report to the Timber Mill, calling on all employees to assist in doing a good job in the inspection work. He explained the policies to everyone, initially breaking the employees' fear of being retaliated against for reporting situations. At the same time, they cooperated well with the leadership of the Timber Mill. Further patriotic education was conducted among the employees, and the employees were mobilized to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and a democratic inspection was conducted. The previously monopolized trade union was reorganized. In this way, the employees were mobilized, and they put forward more than 40 rationalization proposals and actively reported situations to the inspection team, such as workers Zhang Quanyuan and Qian Wennan, who took the initiative to report situations such as "embezzlement," "selling finished products as waste materials," "wood rot," and "theft of public property." The embezzlement case of Fang Lantian and others in the Tonglu Purchasing Office was also traced from the information reflected by the employees. This was also a practical education for the leaders of the Timber Mill, who realized the importance of the inspection work and cooperated with the inspection in all aspects. Shen Pengcai, the deputy director of the mill, personally assisted the inspection team in conducting inspections at the Tonglu Purchasing Office, conducting in-depth visits with farmers in the countryside, and helping the inspection team solve difficulties in business, accounts, and procedures.

When inspecting the Tonglu Purchasing Office, the previous experience was accepted, and attention was paid from the beginning to cooperating and contacting all relevant parties, and mobilizing the staff in the organs to report. In the first two weeks, a general inspection was also carried out: "checking accounts," "looking at files," and "turning over invoices." Because Fang Lantian, Zhang Xiufeng, and Teng Shaoqing had already made false accounts and false invoices, very few problems were discovered. Only three blank receipts of Teng Shaoqing and four blank invoices of Zhang Xiufeng, as well as vague and chaotic phenomena in the accounts, were found in the account checking and invoicing. Nothing was found in Fang Lantian's accounts. However, after breaking the ideological concerns of the general staff of the Purchasing Office and mobilizing everyone to report, many problems were discovered. For example, Xu Helin, a buyer from the Zhixia Purchasing Team, knew a lot of Zhang Xiufeng's embezzlement facts, but he had ideological concerns: he thought he had done things for Zhang Xiufeng before and was afraid of implicating himself; he was also afraid that he would not be able to keep his "rice bowl" after the inspection team left, so he dared not talk. After the inspection team educated him, explaining that corruption was the most vicious enemy of increasing production and practicing economy to build the country, and everyone should report it; it also explained the policy: the state loves honest and law-abiding staff, and only corrupt elements will be punished. He understood the truth, cleared his mind, and said, "I would be sorry to the country if I didn't report the situation," and revealed twelve cases of Zhang Xiufeng's embezzlement behavior, such as using large-sized measures to measure farmers' wood when buying wood at Zhangjiabu. Guo Zihai also reported Fang Lantian's embezzlement behavior of putting public funds in the home of his mistress, Yang Xuemei, and letting Yang Xuemei use public funds to do wood business in the Yangxi area. Five of the nine staff members of the Jiande Purchasing Team reported Fang Lantian's embezzlement behavior.

Deeply Mobilizing the Masses Led to the Full Exposure of the Case
After mobilizing the staff within the organs to report, the embezzlement behavior of the corrupt elements was initially exposed. Then the inspection team mobilized workers and farmers outside the factory to report, and as a result, the embezzlement behavior of these three corrupt criminals was fully discovered. Before mobilizing workers and farmers to report extensively, the inspection team first contacted the local Tonglu, Jiande and other county people's governments and the Jiuling, Hengcun, Dazhou, Yangxi and other district and township people's governments and mass organizations to strive for the assistance of all parties. The Tonglu and Jiande County People's Governments specifically instructed each district and relevant departments to assist, and each district also instructed the township governments and mass organizations to closely cooperate and assist in mobilizing the masses and understanding the situation. The district and township cadres knew a lot about Fang Lantian's embezzlement behavior, and in addition to mobilizing workers and farmers to report, they also actively reflected the situation, which played a great role in the progress of the inspection work. For example, the director of the Dazhou Township Farmers Association assisted day and night, conducted in-depth investigations, and revealed on the spot that the timber merchant Wang Changjin (a controlled counter-revolutionary element) who colluded with Fang Lantian tried to deceive with false accounts. Zheng, the deputy district chief of Qiantan District, personally accompanied the inspection team to Xukou, ten miles away, to understand the situation. Zhang, the township chief (female) of Langyuan Township, Jiuling District, Tonglu County, assisted the inspection team in going to various villages and households to investigate, and learned a lot of information through women.

With the close cooperation of district and township cadres, the inspection team took suspicious receipts and invoices to Yangxi, Xucun, Dazhou, Zhixia, Jiuling and other wood-producing areas to mobilize the masses to report. When mobilizing, they first learned about the situation in depth, and then used typical demonstrations to educate the masses and clear their minds. For example, in Xucun Township, it was found that Fang Lantian and others forged a contract for farmer Ye Tianshun, which stated that the price of each liang of fir wood was 310,000 yuan. In fact, Ye Tianshun's fir wood was purchased by private merchant He Yukun under Fang Lantian's instructions. The price of each liang of mountain was 130 jin of rice, plus 110 jin of rice for cutting and transportation, totaling 240 jin of rice per liang (equivalent to 240,000 yuan at that time), and no contract had been signed. Through this fact, the inspection team explained to Ye Tianshun that the embezzlement behavior of corrupt elements not only infringes on the interests of farmers, but also infringes on the interests of the country, and the interests of the country are the interests of all the people. In order to eliminate this behavior, we must rise up and fight resolutely against this behavior. To this end, Ye Tianshun was educated to reveal it publicly. At first, Ye Tianshun still held the incorrect understanding of "let it go," "why bother," "it's already passed," and "officials to officials, people to people." After patriotic ideological education and after explaining the policy, his patriotic awareness was raised, his concerns were eliminated, and he bravely revealed Fang Lantian's fraudulent behavior in public. The inspection team then held mass meetings in succession, widely introducing Ye Tianshun's example to everyone, calling on everyone to eliminate ideological concerns and rise up together to expose the crimes of corrupt elements. At this point, the masses rose up one after another to expose Fang Lantian, Zhang Xiufeng, and Teng Shaoqing's crimes of corruption. For example, farmer A Da Mei revealed that Fang Lantian colluded with private merchant He Yukun to forge the 16 liang of fir wood he sold into a receipt of 120 liang of pine wood. A women's committee member in a village revealed that after the inspection team arrived, the wife of private merchant He Yukun tried to buy her off, asking her not to report He Yukun's illegal behavior. Thirty-six households in four villages in Dazhou Township who sold wood unanimously rose up to report Fang Lantian and others' behavior of colluding with private merchants to forge receipts. Many farmers also rushed from 30 miles away to expose and check receipts after hearing the news of the inspection team's arrival. Boatmen in Yangxi, Shilibu, Xiayabu, Xukou and other places also spontaneously organized to calculate the amount of wood transported and exposed Fang Lantian, Zhang Xiufeng, and Teng Shaoqing's crimes of stealing public property. For example, boatmen in Shilibu revealed that of the 500 liang of wood transported for Fang Lantian, 140 liang were transported to private merchant Wang Kaichao in Shanghai. Li Huabao, a farmer in San Village, Xiaba Township, Zhixia Town, reported that Zhang Xiufeng bought 48 liang and 7 qian of wood from farmers in the village, and had already deducted the transportation costs from the farmers, but later reimbursed the transportation costs from the Zhejiang Construction Company, embezzling 1,176,000 yuan from it. Chen Yuli, a farmer in the Second Village, revealed that Zhang Xiufeng bought 70 liang of fir wood in the village, deducted more than 1,320,000 yuan in taxes from the farmers, and later reported all the taxes to the Zhejiang Construction Company, a crime of embezzling national taxes. When exposing the crimes of corrupt elements, the masses were very enthusiastic. Farmer Fang Guanjin said, "The People's Government is really honest. When someone embezzles when we sell wood, they immediately send someone to check." An old lady in her 60s said, "When Chairman Mao's people come down to investigate, we must report everything we know." Because almost all the boatmen and farmers who sold wood participated in this anti-corruption movement, Fang Lantian, Zhang Xiufeng, Teng Shaoqing, and others' crimes of seeking private interests, engaging in corruption, and dereliction of duty, causing the state to lose more than 739 million yuan, could no longer be concealed, and all their tricks were exposed.

    浙江省查获方蓝田等贪污巨案的经验证明
    反贪污运动必须深入发动群众
    自上而下的检查结合广大群众的检举，终使妄图隐瞒的贪污分子，落入人民的法网。
    浙江省人民政府人民监察委员会检查国营浙江建筑公司木料厂工作中，由于广泛发动和依靠群众，查获了该厂所属桐庐采购处方蓝田、章秀峰、滕绍青三人贪污渎职、盗窃国家财产的巨大案件。这一事实充分证明了：自上而下组织检查结合广泛发动群众自下而上进行检举，是开展反贪污运动的重要关键。
    初期检查脱离群众收获很少
    浙江省人民政府人民监察委员会检查组开始到浙江建筑公司及所属木料厂检查时，对发动群众、依靠群众的方针是不很明确的。当时由于检查组与被检查机关的组织和行政领导上配合不好，与厂内职工的联系也不密切，更加上木料厂的部分工作人员，把“自己的厂”和国家分开来认识，不明白应该怎样才是为国家负责，也没有认识到贪污、浪费是我们开展增产节约运动的最大的敌人，因此，工作中遇到许多阻碍。有的人要顾全自己单位的“面子”，或对“检查”两字听不惯，对这一斗争采取不负责任或不耐烦的态度。如该厂业务股副股长孙桐茂，从一九五○年六月该厂开办时就进厂工作，厂内情况比较熟悉，但他对检查组采取躲避的态度，认为“我不贪污，别人的事我可以不管”。副厂长沈鹏才也曾不耐烦地说：“检查组为什么还不走？”个别感到自己思想、作风和其他方面有问题的工作人员，则采取对抗态度，企图“包围”“封锁”检查组。如工人施百才向检查组反映一次情况后，便被某股长叫去“个别谈话”，对施百才说：“有意见向我们领导上谈，为什么向检查组反映？”造成了一般职工不敢接近检查组的现象。职工向检查组反映情况有三种顾虑：一、怕失业；二、怕得罪了领导人，要降低薪水；三、试用职工怕不录用。因此，就使检查工作受到了很大的阻碍，半个月时间没有搞出个结果。
    发动职工检举发现案件线索
    根据以上情况，检查组重新研究了检查工作，明确了方针：密切联系当事机关，对职工进行广泛宣传教育，发动和依靠职工发现问题。检查组和建筑公司领导上重新研究了检查工作，吸收建筑公司三个同志协助检查。建筑公司副经理刘绍文专门向木料厂作了动员报告，号召全体职工协助做好检查工作。他向大家说明政策，初步打破了职工怕反映情况受打击的思想顾虑。同时和木料厂领导方面配合好。向职工进一步进行爱国主义教育，发动职工开展批评和自我批评，进行民主大检查，领导改选了以前包办代替的工会。这样职工才发动了起来，职工们提了四十余条合理化建议，并积极向检查组反映情况，如工人张泉源、钱文楠等主动找检查组反映了“贪污”、“成品当废料卖”、“木材霉烂”、“盗卖公物”等情况。桐庐采购处方蓝田等贪污案件，也从职工反映的情况中得到了线索。这对木料厂领导上也是一次实际的教育，认识到检查工作的重要性，从各方面配合检查。该厂副厂长沈鹏才亲自协助检查组到桐庐采购处进行检查，深入农村向农民访问，并帮助检查组解决业务、账目、手续中的困难。
    检查桐庐采购处时，接受了以前的经验，一开始就注意同各有关方面配合联系，发动机关里的工作人员检举。在开始的两个星期中，也进行了一般的检查：“查账目”、“看卷宗”、“翻票据”等。因方蓝田、章秀峰、滕绍青早已把假账目、假票据造好，发现问题很少。只在查账目和票据中，发现了滕绍青三张空白单据；章秀峰四张空白发票，及账内模糊混乱等现象。从方蓝田的账目中没有查出什么问题。但经打破采购处一般工作人员的思想顾虑，发动大家起来检举后，便发现了很多问题。如芝厦采购组采购员徐荷林，明知章秀峰的很多贪污事实，但思想上存在顾虑：认为自己曾替章秀峰办过事，怕连累到自己；又怕检查组走后“饭碗”保不住，因此不敢谈。经检查组向他进行教育，讲明贪污行为是实行增产节约建设国家最凶恶的敌人，人人应该检举；又讲明了政策：国家爱护廉洁奉公的工作人员，只有贪污分子才会受到惩办。他明白了道理，打通了思想，表示“我不反映情况就对不起国家”，揭发了章秀峰在张家埠买木材时用大尺码量农民木材等贪污行为十二件。郭子海也检举了方蓝田把公款放在姘妇杨雪梅家里，让杨雪梅在洋溪一带用公款做木材生意的贪污行为。建德采购组九个工作人员，有五个检举了方蓝田的贪污行为。
    深入发动群众案件全部揭发
    经过机关内部发动职工进行检举，已使贪污分子的贪污行为初步暴露。接着检查组就发动厂外的工人、农民进行检举，结果，这三个贪污犯的贪污行为便被全部发现。在发动工人、农民广泛检举前，检查组首先和所在地桐庐、建德等县人民政府和九岭、横村、大州、洋溪等区乡人民政府和群众团体密切联系，争取各方面力量协助。桐庐、建德县人民政府为此专门指示各区及有关部门进行协助，各区也指示乡政府及群众团体密切配合，协助发动群众，了解情况。区、乡干部因对方蓝田等贪污行为很了解，除了发动工人、农民检举，自己也积极反映情况，对检查工作的进展起了很大作用。如大州乡农会主任，日夜协助，深入调查，与方蓝田勾结的木商汪昌金（被管制的反革命分子），企图用假账瞒骗，他就当场揭破。乾潭区郑副区长，亲自陪检查组到十里路外的胥口了解情况。桐庐县九岭区阆苑乡张乡长（女）协助检查组到各村深入各户调查，通过妇女了解了很多情况。
    在区、乡干部的密切配合下，检查组便带了可疑单据发票到洋溪、许村、大州、芝厦、九岭等产木地区发动群众检举。发动时先深入了解情况，再以典型示范向群众进行教育，打通群众思想。如在许村乡，发现方蓝田等假造了农民叶田顺合约一个，上面注明每两杉木价三十一万元，实际上叶田顺的杉木是方蓝田指使私商何玉琨购买的，每两山价一百三十斤米，加上砍工、运工、出水一百十斤米，合计每两只需二百四十斤米（当时合二十四万元），并且未曾订过合约。检查组通过这件事实，向叶田顺说明：贪污分子的贪污行为，不仅侵犯了农民的利益，而且侵犯了国家的利益，而国家的利益也就是全体人民的利益。为了要肃清这种行为，就要起来和这种行为进行坚决斗争。以此教育叶田顺当众进行揭发。起初叶田顺还抱着“算了吧”、“何必呢”、“已经过去了”及“官向官，民向民”的不正确认识，经过爱国主义的思想教育，并经讲清政策后，提高了他的爱国觉悟，解除了顾虑，勇敢地当众揭发了方蓝田的舞弊行为。检查组紧接着又连续地召开了群众大会，以叶田顺的例子向大家广泛介绍，号召大家解除思想顾虑，一齐起来揭发贪污分子的罪行。至此，群众纷纷起来揭发方蓝田、章秀峰、滕绍青的贪污罪行。如农民阿大妹揭发了方蓝田勾结私商何玉琨，把他卖出的十六两杉木假造成一百二十两松段的单据。某村妇女委员揭发了私商何玉琨的老婆在检查组到后，企图收买她，要她不反映何玉琨等的违法行为。大州乡有四个村三十六户卖过木材的农民，一致起来检举方蓝田等勾结私商造假票据的行为。还有很多农民听到检查组来检查的消息后，从三十里路外赶来揭发，核对票据。洋溪、十里埠、下涯埠、胥口等地船工，也自动组织起来计算了运木材数量，揭发了方蓝田、章秀峰、滕绍青盗卖公物罪行。如十里埠船工揭发了在给方蓝田运的五百多两木材中，有一百四十两是运给上海私商汪开朝的。芝厦镇下宝乡三村农民李华宝检举章秀峰向该村农民买木材四十八两七钱，本来已从农民中扣出运费，但后来又向浙江建筑公司报销运费，从中贪污一百十七万六千元。第二村农民陈郁立揭发章秀峰在该村买杉木七十两，向农民扣收税款一百三十二万余元，后来又向浙江建筑公司报了全部税款的侵吞国税的罪行。在揭发贪污分子的罪行时，群众情绪很高，农民方关金说：“人民政府真清廉，我们卖木材时有人贪污就马上派人来检查。”六十多岁的一个老太婆说：“毛主席的人下来查问，我们都要把知道的报出来。”由于全体船工和卖过木材的农民几乎全部参加了这一反贪污运动，方蓝田、章秀峰、滕绍青等营私舞弊、贪污渎职，使国家受到七亿三千九百余万元损失的罪恶，再也没法掩盖，所有诡计全都被揭穿了。
