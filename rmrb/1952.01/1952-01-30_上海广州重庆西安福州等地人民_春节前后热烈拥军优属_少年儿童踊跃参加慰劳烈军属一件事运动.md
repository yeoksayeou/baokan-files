Xinhua News Agency, January 29th - People in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Fuzhou, and other places are enthusiastically carrying out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers around the Spring Festival.

The East China Military and Political Committee, the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shanghai Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, the Shanghai Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Shanghai local organizations of various democratic parties, and various people's organizations organized慰问团(comfort groups), respectively, to extend cordial greetings to the wounded and sick members of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army who were recuperating in Shanghai on the 24th and 25th. The comfort teams organized by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and people from all walks of life visited the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers before the Spring Festival, and solicited their opinions on preferential treatment work. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government distributed 400,000 jin of preferential grain and 500 million yuan of preferential allowance to poor families of martyrs and soldiers throughout the city. People from all walks of life also spontaneously launched a donation campaign for comfort, with donations in嵩山区 (Songshan District) reaching 200 million yuan and榆林区 (Yulin District) exceeding 120 million yuan.

Each district and street (village) in Chongqing established Spring Festival Preferential Treatment Work Inspection and Promotion Committees to inspect the implementation of preferential treatment regulations, discuss the preferential treatment work plan for 1952, and revise the Patriotic Pact.

Xi'an's Spring Festival activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers began on the 22nd. The city also plans to convene a representative conference of families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers after the Spring Festival to elect model families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers and give them awards or commendations.

Two days before the Spring Festival, the Fuzhou Municipal People's Government distributed 220,000 jin of rice and 100 million yuan in Renminbi to poor families of martyrs and soldiers. Twenty-two industries throughout the city, including barbershops, bathhouses, photography studios, and theaters, gave away more than 27,000 free tickets and discounted preferential tickets to families of martyrs and soldiers in the ten days before the Spring Festival.

Young Pioneers in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Fuzhou, and other cities actively participated in the "doing one good deed to comfort families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers" campaign during the Spring Festival. Nearly 110,000 Young Pioneers in Shanghai formed more than 9,700 teams. The Young Pioneers not only gave Spring Festival gifts to the glorious families of martyrs and soldiers but also enthusiastically helped them clean their houses and wash their clothes. More than 10,000 Young Pioneer members and primary school students in Guangzhou participated in this work. The Young Pioneers in Fuzhou organized 386 squadrons to visit families of martyrs and soldiers separately.
