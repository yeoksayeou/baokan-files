    The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Decision on Eliminating the Influence of Bourgeois Ideology Brought to the Party by Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan

    (1) The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC fully agrees with and supports the resolution of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC to expel Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party. The criminal acts of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in betraying the Party and the people, and the corrupting influence of the bourgeoisie they brought to the Party, have seriously damaged the health of the Party organizations in the Tianjin area, and have also seriously damaged the interests of the masses in the Tianjin area and the relationship between the Party and the masses. In order to victoriously carry out the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, the entire region must first carry out an anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign with the main content of eliminating the serious influence of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's crimes within the Party, so that every comrade can be educated from the Liu and Zhang major corruption case, thoroughly eliminate the corrupting influence of the bourgeoisie from the Party, and further consolidate the Party organization in the Tianjin area politically, ideologically, and organizationally under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.
    (2) The struggle to eliminate the ideological influence of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan is a highly principled struggle, a struggle to protect the health of the Party, maintain the Party's fine work style and glorious traditions. The Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan corruption case has warned us: Now is a crucial time for the entire Party to mobilize and resolutely struggle against all bourgeois ideological influences that have invaded the Party. If we do not immediately, resolutely, and systematically carry out this struggle, we will make serious mistakes. Therefore, in this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, every comrade is required to consciously, actively, and resolutely participate, and ideologically draw a clear line between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. The vast majority of Party members and cadres in the Tianjin area have in the past been dissatisfied with and some have resolutely opposed the crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan. Therefore, the vast majority of comrades are active in this struggle. We ask comrades who have fought against the criminal acts of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in the past to further clarify the principles of the struggle, stand at the forefront of safeguarding the interests of the Party, and further temper themselves in the struggle. Some comrades still have concerns and dare not boldly expose their mistakes. Now they must dispel their concerns and quickly and bravely join this struggle. There are also some comrades who think it has nothing to do with them and are not concerned or active in this struggle. This idea is wrong. This is due to insufficient understanding of the seriousness of the Liu and Zhang corruption case, and failure to realize that this struggle is of historical significance, is a major issue related to the construction of the Party, the construction of the country, and the interests of millions of people. Every comrade must learn a lesson from this incident. As for comrades who have been deeply influenced by Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan or have some involvement in their crimes, they should be determined to put down their "burdens" and bravely expose past mistakes. The Party organization will not treat these comrades the same as Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, because there is a distinction between the mistakes of these comrades and their crimes. These comrades should draw a line between themselves and the degenerate thinking of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, seriously expose and report, thoroughly eliminate the influence of Liu and Zhang on themselves, stand on the correct side, and frankly explain the problem to the Party and the people, and seriously conduct self-criticism. Those who can do this can have their punishment reduced if the mistake is serious, or be exempted from punishment if the mistake is minor. If they persist in their mistakes, remain unrepentant, and do not actively confess or expose, and are exposed by others, they will inevitably be severely punished by Party discipline.
    (3) In order to ensure that every comrade is truly educated and improved in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign with the elimination of the ideological influence of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan as the main task, we must adopt a method of implementing from within the Party to outside the Party, from top to bottom, level by level. First, carry out a rectification campaign for cadres at the special district level, and at the same time, counties should prepare for learning, and then launch a rectification campaign for cadres in various counties and towns. After the Party representative meeting of each county is over, it will be carried out at the district level. In terms of implementation methods, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, extensively promote democracy, the leading cadres are responsible, personally take action, and deeply carry out criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom and from bottom to top. First, study the relevant documents to improve understanding. Then expose and report, and confess the facts of corruption and waste. Finally, mobilize every cadre and every department to formulate plans, stipulate systems, and discuss the handling of the problems exposed. Ensure that the bourgeois ideological influence within the Party is eliminated, corrupt elements are punished as they deserve, and comrades who are honest and law-abiding and can conduct a just struggle against bad tendencies should be commended.
    (4) With regard to the state property illegally stolen by Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in violation of laws and disciplines, as well as the relief grain, subsidies for family members of cadres, local grain, special water conservancy funds that they privately misappropriated, and the exploitation of river workers, deduction of subsidies for airport repair workers and workers' wages, etc., must be handled separately in accordance with the decision of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and a special agency should be established to listen to the decisions of the higher authorities to clean up the production of the local committee agencies.
    (5) The reason why the criminal acts of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in violating laws and disciplines, corruption, and degeneration were not exposed and corrected earlier, causing great damage to the Party's influence among the people and to state property, is inseparable from the serious liberalism among the members of the local committee in the past. Therefore, the local committee must conduct strict inspection and self-criticism. Party members and cadres in the entire region should also fully provide opinions to help the local committee check past mistakes, so as to improve leadership, correct mistakes, and smoothly carry out the patriotic production increase and economy campaign. At the same time, from the lessons of the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan corruption case, Party organizations at all levels and all comrades should deeply recognize the serious harm of bourgeois corrupting influence to the Party, be highly vigilant, earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, improve our political awareness and theoretical level, and maintain the proletarian purity of the Party. This requires us to improve the democratic life and democratic system within the Party, and earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism. All Party members must be placed under the education and supervision of the Party and the supervision of the masses, work more closely with the broad masses of the people, and victoriously promote the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, so as to strive for victory in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea and to welcome the arrival of large-scale economic construction tasks.

    中国共产党天津地方委员会
    关于肃清刘青山张子善带给党内的资产阶级思想影响的决定
    （一）中共天津地委完全同意和拥护中共河北省委关于开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决议。刘青山、张子善这种背叛党、背叛人民的罪恶行为，和他们带给党内的资产阶级的腐化影响，已严重地损害了天津地区党组织的健康，也严重地损害了天津地区的群众利益和党与群众的关系。为了胜利地开展爱国增产节约运动，全区首先必须开展以肃清刘青山、张子善罪行在党内的严重影响为主要内容的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，务使每个同志从刘、张大贪污事件中得到教育，把资产阶级的腐化影响从党内彻底清除出去，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，以进一步从政治上、思想上、组织上巩固天津地区党的组织。
    （二）肃清刘青山、张子善思想影响的斗争，是
    一个高度原则性的斗争，是保护党的健康、保持党的优良作风和光荣传统的斗争。刘青山、张子善的贪污案件，向我们提出了警告：现在是全党动员向
    一切侵入党内来的资产阶级思想影响进行坚决斗争的紧要时候了，如不立即坚决地有系统地开展这一斗争，我们就会犯严重的错误。因此，在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，要求每个同志都自觉地、积极地、坚决地参加，从思想上划清无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想之间的界限。天津地区的党员干部，过去绝大部分是不满并有些是坚决反对刘青山、张子善这种罪行的，因此，绝大多数同志在这一斗争中是积极的。我们要求过去对刘青山、张子善罪恶行为进行过斗争的同志，更要明确斗争的原则性，站在维护党的利益的前锋，进一步从斗争中锻炼自己。有些仍有顾虑，不敢大胆揭发他们的错误的同志，现在要解除顾虑，迅速勇敢地投入这一斗争。还有一些同志认为与自己无关，对这一斗争不关心、不积极，这种想法是错误的。这是对刘、张贪污事件的严重性认识不足，没有认识到这一斗争是带有历史意义的，是关系到党的建设、国家建设和千百万人民利益的重大问题，每个同志都必须从这个事件中得到教训。至于受刘青山、张子善影响较深或与他二人的罪行有些牵连的同志，应决心放下“包袱”，勇于揭发过去的错误，党的组织是不会把这些同志和刘青山、张子善一律看待的，因这些同志的错误和他二人的罪行，是有区别的。这些同志，应和刘青山、张子善的蜕化堕落思想划清界限，认真地进行揭发、检举，彻底肃清刘、张二人对自己的影响，站到正确的方面来，坦白地把问题向党向人民交代清楚，认真地进行检讨。能够这样做的，错误大的可减轻处分，错误小的可免予处分；如果坚持错误，仍不觉悟，不积极坦白、揭发，而被他人检举出来，必然要受到党纪的严厉处分。
    （三）为了使每个同志在以肃清刘青山、张子善思想影响为主的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中真正得到教育提高，必须采取由党内到党外、由上到下、逐级贯彻的方法。首先进行专区级的干部整风，同时县级进行学习准备，然后展开各县镇的干部整风。各县党的代表会议结束后，再在区级进行。在进行方法上，要充分发动群众，广泛发扬民主，领导干部负责，亲自动手，自上而下和自下而上地深入开展批评与自我批评。首先学习各有关文件，提高认识。然后再揭发、检举，坦白贪污、浪费的错误事实。最后发动每个干部和每个部门，订立计划，规定制度，讨论对揭发出来的问题的处理。作到使党内的资产阶级思想影响得以肃清，贪污分子受到应有的惩处；而廉洁奉公、遵守法纪、并能和不良倾向进行严正斗争的同志，则应受到表扬。
    （四）对于刘青山、张子善违法乱纪盗窃的国家资财与其私自动用的救济粮、干部家属补助粮、地方粮、水利专款和剥削治河民工、克扣修理飞机场民工补助粮及工人工资等，必须依据河北省人民政府的决定进行分别处理，并成立专门机构听候上级决定清理地委机关生产。
    （五）刘青山、张子善违法犯纪贪污腐化的罪恶行为，所以没有及早揭发和纠正，使党在人民中的影响和国家财产遭受很大损害，这和过去地委委员之间严重的自由主义是分不开的，因而地委会必须进行严格的检查和检讨。全区的党员干部，亦应充分提供意见，帮助地委检查过去的错误，以便改进领导，纠正错误，顺利开展爱国增产节约运动。同时，从刘青山、张子善贪污事件的教训中，各级党的组织和全体同志应深刻认识到资产阶级腐化影响对党的严重危害，高度警惕起来，提高政治敏感性，认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，提高我们的政治觉悟和理论水平，保持党的无产阶级的纯洁。这就必须要健全党内的民主生活和民主制度，认真地开展批评与自我批评。一切党员，均须置于党的教育、监督和群众监督之下，更加紧密地和广大人民一起，胜利地推进爱国增产节约运动，以争取抗美援朝斗争的胜利和迎接大规模经济建设任务的到来。一九五一年十二月二十日
