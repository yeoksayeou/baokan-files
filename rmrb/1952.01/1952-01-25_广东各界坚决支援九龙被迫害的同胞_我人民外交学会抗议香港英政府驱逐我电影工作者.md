    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd. All circles in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City continue to support and provide relief to the more than 16,000 Chinese compatriots in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, who suffered a major fire and are constantly subjected to barbaric persecution by the British government in Hong Kong. The Guangdong Provincial Branch and Guangzhou City Branch of the China People's Relief Association jointly invited representatives of people's organizations from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City on the 17th to hold a symposium to discuss how to actively carry out the work of supporting the disaster-stricken compatriots in Tung Tau Tsuen. At the meeting, Li Zhangda, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Relief Association, announced on behalf of the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou City Relief Associations that RMB 200 million would be allocated to provide relief to the disaster-stricken compatriots in Tung Tau Tsuen. Representatives of overseas Chinese returning from Indonesia also immediately donated RMB 20 million in relief funds. Representatives of people's organizations unanimously stated in their speeches that they would mobilize people from all walks of life to carry out support and relief work. The Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions issued a letter to workers throughout the province on the 20th, exposing the Hong Kong British government's atrocities against the disaster-stricken compatriots in Tung Tau Tsuen, calling on workers throughout the province to promote the spirit of fraternity, vigorously donate funds for relief, and resolutely support the just struggle of the disaster-stricken compatriots in Tung Tau Tsuen against the Hong Kong British government's barbaric persecution!
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement protesting the Hong Kong British government's unreasonable expulsion of our film workers:
    The Hong Kong British government used barbaric means to unreasonably arrest our film workers Sima Wensen, Ma Guoliang, Qi Wenshao, Liu Qiong, Shu Shi, Yang Hua, Shen Ji, Di Fan and others on January 10 and expelled them from the country. We express our utmost indignation at this shameless atrocity by the Hong Kong British government and lodge a serious protest.
    This atrocity by the Hong Kong British government is a planned part of the British imperialists' consistent pursuit of the US imperialists' policy of aggression and hostile measures against the Chinese people, and it is also a blatant manifestation of the Hong Kong British government's further sabotage and suppression of the great and just patriotic actions of our compatriots in Hong Kong. This sinful act of the Hong Kong British government is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.
    We solemnly declare that the Chinese people are not afraid of any provocation by imperialism, and the Chinese people's freedom and rights are inviolable. The Hong Kong British government must bear full responsibility for the consequences of this barbaric atrocity.

    我人民外交学会抗议香港英政府驱逐我电影工作者
    【新华社广州二十二日电】广东省和广州市各界继续支援和救济九龙城东头村遭受大火浩劫并不断受到香港英国政府横蛮迫害的一万六千多我国同胞。中国人民救济总会广东省分会和广州市分会在十七日联合邀请广东省和广州市各人民团体代表举行座谈会，讨论如何积极展开支援东头村受灾同胞工作问题。会上，广东省救济分会副主席李章达代表广东省和广州市救济分会宣布拨人民币二亿元救济东头村受灾同胞，印尼归国华侨代表也即席捐出救济款二千万元。各人民团体代表在发言中一致表示要发动各阶层人民展开支援和救济工作。广东省总工会筹备委员会已在二十日发出告全省工人书，向全省工人揭露香港英国政府迫害东头村受灾的同胞的暴行，号召全省工人发扬友爱精神，大力捐款救济，并坚决支援东头村受灾同胞反对香港英政府横蛮迫害的正义斗争！
    【新华社十九日讯】中国人民外交学会为抗议香港英国政府无理驱逐我电影工作者的暴行，发表声明如下：
    香港英国政府使用横蛮手段，于一月十日无理逮捕我电影工作者司马文森、马国亮、齐闻韶、刘琼、舒适、杨华、沈寂、狄梵等八人，并驱逐其出境。我们对香港英国政府这种无耻的暴行，表示万分愤慨，特提出严重抗议。
    香港英国政府这一暴行是英帝国主义者一贯追随美帝国主义者侵略政策、敌视中国人民的各项措施中有计划的一部分，同时也是香港英国政府进一步破坏、压制我国在港同胞伟大正义的爱国行动的露骨表现。香港英国政府的这种罪恶行为，是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    我们严正地声明：中国人民是不怕帝国主义任何挑衅的，中国人民的自由权利是不容侵犯的。香港英国政府应对这种横蛮暴行的后果负完全的责任。
