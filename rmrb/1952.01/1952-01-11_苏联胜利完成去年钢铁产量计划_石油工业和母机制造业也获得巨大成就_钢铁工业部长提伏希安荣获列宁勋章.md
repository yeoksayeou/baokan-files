    Xinhua News Agency, 7th. (Dispatch from TASS, Moscow) Moscow newspapers published on the 4th a report from Tevosyan, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Minister of the Steel Industry, to Stalin, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, reporting that the 1951 pig iron production plan was completed ahead of schedule on December 27th of last year, and the steel production plan was victoriously completed on December 31st. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, in order to commend Tevosyan's outstanding contributions to promoting the development of the Soviet metallurgical industry, specially awarded him the Order of Lenin; the newspapers all published the awarding decree.
    Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The Soviet petroleum industry and machine tool manufacturing industry made great achievements in 1951. According to TASS: Soviet oil workers completed the annual production plan for petroleum, petroleum products, and lubricants on December 28, 1951. Last year's oil production greatly exceeded the previous year. Throughout the year, the Soviet Union discovered rich new oil deposits. In terms of technology, high-speed well drilling methods have been further developed, and the widespread use of turbo-drilling has greatly accelerated the drilling of oil wells, especially in hard rock areas. Workers' technical indicators and conservation indicators have also been greatly improved. The output per worker in enterprises under the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry was 2 percent higher than planned and 8 percent higher than in 1950; in construction projects, the output per worker was 6 percent higher than planned and 8 percent higher than in 1950. In terms of equipment, the total output of machine-building factories under the Soviet Ministry of the Petroleum Industry in 1951 was 22 percent higher than in 1950. Not only were the latest equipment widely used in various departments of the original petroleum industry, but also new refineries equipped with various new equipment were opened. In the postwar years, innovators and rationalization proposers have put forward more than 150,000 suggestions and inventions. More than 200 advanced oil workers have received Stalin Prizes.
    The Soviet machine tool manufacturing industry has made great progress. Now, the equipment manufactured by each giant machine tool factory in the Soviet Union every year can fully equip six to eight new factories. In 1950, Soviet machine tool manufacturing workers refined 117 new types of machine tools, four automatic continuous production devices, and established the famous automatic piston factory. Of the 400 new types of machines and equipment manufactured by the Soviet Union in 1951, more than 150 were products of machine tool factories. The movement for high-speed metal cutting has promoted the further improvement of the Soviet machine tool manufacturing industry. Now the "Red Proletarian" factory is producing lathes that rotate 3,000 times per minute. This year, the high-speed cutting method will be promoted in the work of manufacturing large parts of machine tools. The great communist construction projects have stimulated the development of the Soviet machine tool industry. Now, the Soviet machine tool manufacturing industry is designing and manufacturing various new types of lathes for mechanical factories that manufacture giant turbines, generators, transformers, and other equipment for communist construction projects. For example, the Kolomna factory has now begun to design and continuously manufacture a vertical lathe capable of manufacturing parts with a diameter of 3,200 mm (i.e., 3.2 meters), and is starting to organize the manufacture of another vertical lathe that will be able to manufacture parts with a diameter of 5,250 mm.

    苏联胜利完成去年钢铁产量计划
    石油工业和母机制造业也获得巨大成就
    钢铁工业部长提伏希安荣获列宁勋章
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科各报在四日刊载了苏联部长会议副主席、钢铁工业部长提伏希安给苏联部长会议主席斯大林的报告书，报告一九五一年生铁产量计划已在去年十二月二十七日提前完成，钢的产量计划已在十二月三十一日胜利完成。苏联最高苏维埃主席团为了表彰提伏希安在促进苏联冶金工业的发展方面的卓越贡献，特授以列宁勋章；各报都发表了授勋令。
    【新华社九日讯】苏联石油工业和母机制造业在一九五一年获得了巨大成就。据塔斯社消息：苏联石油工人在一九五一年十二月二十八日完成了全年石油、石油产品和滑润油的生产计划。去年石油产量大大超过了前年。一年来，苏联发现了丰富的新的石油矿藏，在技术方面，高速凿井的方法已有进一步的发展，透平钻掘法的广泛使用大大加速了油井的开凿，特别是硬石地区油井的开凿。工人的技术指标和节约指标也大大提高了。石油工业部所属各企业的每一工人的产量比计划高出百分之二，比一九五○年高出百分之八；在建筑工程方面，每一工人的产量比计划高出百分之六，比一九五○年高出百分之八。在设备方面，一九五一年苏联石油工业部所属各机器制造厂的总产量比一九五○年高百分之二十二。不仅原有石油工业各部门广泛使用了最新式的装备，而且还开设了用各种新式设备装备起来的新炼油厂。战后数年中，革新者和合理化建议者提出了十五万件以上的建议和发明。有二百多先进石油工人得到了斯大林奖金。
    苏联母机制造业已有了巨大进步。现在苏联每一所巨型母机工厂每年制造的设备，可以充分装备六所到八所新工厂。在一九五○年，苏联母机制造工人曾精制了一百一十七种新式母机，四种自动连续生产装置，并建立了著名的自动活塞工厂，一九五一年苏联制造的四百种新式机器和装备中，有一百五十种以上是母机工厂的出品。高速切削金属的运动促进了苏联母机制造业的进一步改善。现在“红色无产者”工厂正生产每分钟旋转三千次的车床。今年将在制造母机的大零件的工作中推广高速度切削法。伟大的共产主义建设工程刺激了苏联母机工业的发展。现在苏联母机制造业正在设计和制造各种新式的车床，供那些为共产主义建设工程制造巨型涡轮、发电机、变压器等设备的机械工厂之用。例如科洛姆纳工厂现在已开始设计和连续制造一种能制造直径三千二百公厘（即三点二公尺）的零件的垂直车床，并着手组织制造另一种垂直车床，它将能制造直径有五千二百五十公厘的零件。
