The Beijing Municipal Trade Union Federation's Economy and Austerity Inspection Committee held a general meeting of all staff at the Cultural Palace on the morning of the 10th of this month. Over 400 people attended from the Municipal Trade Union Federation, district offices, and affiliated units of the Municipal Trade Union Federation. The meeting announced the crimes of corrupt elements Zhang Fengming and Huang Jinhuan. The Public Security Bureau arrested the two criminals on the spot and sent them to the court for legal action. Those present were in high spirits, expressing their determination and confidence in successfully promoting this movement until corruption is completely eliminated.

Li Chen, Secretary-General of the Municipal Trade Union Federation, and Zhang Zirong, Director of the Administrative Office, reported on the crimes of Zhang and Huang at the meeting. Zhang Fengming was the director of the Materials Department of the Xinsheng Construction Company. He joined the Communist Party in Shen County in 1939 in the liberated area. In 1944, he embezzled several hundred catties of grain coupons and fled in fear of punishment, coming to Beijing as a laborer. In 1947, he infiltrated the Party again. In 1950, he was transferred to the Xinsheng Construction Company, a production unit of the Beijing Municipal Trade Union Federation. In the year and a half that Zhang was in the Xinsheng Company, he embezzled, took bribes, and stole a total of 28 million yuan. He also misappropriated more than 20 million yuan of public funds. In terms of waste, the loss of timber alone in the first half of 1951 was nearly 20,000 feet (worth about 200 million yuan). Zhang lived extravagantly. He spent more than one million yuan for his child's full-month celebration three times. Workers were usually reluctant to go to the Materials Department, calling it a "small yamen." Huang Jinhuan was the former head of the Cashier Section of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Trade Union Federation, and was consistently corrupt. In addition to regularly embezzling the odd amounts of staff living expenses, he deposited more than 20 million yuan of public funds in private money shops in 1949, embezzling interest of nearly 2 million yuan. In early 1950, when grain prices were rising, Huang misappropriated public funds to hoard and speculate for unscrupulous merchants, profiting 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. The unscrupulous merchant also gave him a watch worth 280,000 yuan. In addition, he embezzled food and meal expenses and stole trade union dues, totaling 5.3 million yuan that has been verified. During the study sessions, the leadership repeatedly explained the significance and policies of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement through general meetings, small meetings, Party member meetings, and individual talks. The two criminals not only did not confess their corruption problems, but also actively engaged with cadres and unscrupulous merchants, attempting to cover up their actions. Zhang Fengming even suppressed democracy, asking those who wanted to report him, "Do you have evidence?" "Can you be responsible for what you say?" During the general staff meeting on December 25th, the leadership asked Huang to publicly confess his corrupt behavior, but he not only did not attend the meeting, but also attempted to escape. When he was brought back by his comrades, he said, "I would rather die by the knife than by words." The leadership had done everything possible for Zhang and Huang, but they still refused to confess and were willing to betray the Party and the people to the end.

After the reports by Li Chen and Zhang Zirong, Liu Zhemin, Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch Committee, spoke on behalf of the General Branch, pointing out that Zhang and Huang's corruption crimes were serious. Despite repeated education by the Party, they consistently showed dishonesty and adopted an antagonistic attitude towards the Party and the people, thus losing the basic qualifications of a Communist Party member. Liu Zhemin, on behalf of the General Branch, announced: The General Branch Committee agreed with the opinions of the First Branch and the Xinsheng Construction Company Branch and had submitted a request to the Municipal Party Committee's Work Committee to approve the expulsion of Zhang Fengming and Huang Jinhuan from the Party.

At this time, the atmosphere at the meeting was high, and everyone spoke up, unanimously supporting the decision of the Party General Branch. They believed that Zhang and Huang's crimes of stealing state property, hoarding and speculating, and betraying the people were serious, and suggested that the two criminals be immediately arrested and sent to the People's Court for severe punishment according to law. The leadership immediately accepted the request of all the comrades present, and the Public Security Bureau arrested the two criminals on the spot. All the comrades present stood up and shouted "Severely punish corrupt elements!" "Report dishonest corrupt elements!" "Welcome corrupt elements to confess!" The shouts lasted for a long time.

Finally, Liu Laifu and Zhang Hongshun, Vice Chairmen of the Municipal Trade Union Federation, gave concluding speeches, explaining that the leadership bore a great responsibility for the growth of these corrupt elements. They had not provided enough ideological education for the cadres, who were corroded by bourgeois ideology. The management system was also not strict, creating favorable opportunities for corrupt elements. Our leading comrades must conduct a deep self-criticism. They also pointed out: Some corrupt elements have not yet thoroughly confessed and are even attempting to hide to the end. For these people, there are only two paths: one is to refuse to confess and face heavier punishment; the other is to confess and make amends, which can reduce or exempt punishment. The first path is impassable because the power of the masses is great. (Office of the Economy and Austerity Inspection Committee of the Beijing Municipal Trade Union Federation)

    北京市总工会贪污分子
    张凤鸣等不肯坦白错误被逮捕送交法院
    北京市总工会节约检查委员会本月十日上午在文化宫召开了全体工作人员大会，到有市总工会机关、各区办事处、及市总工会附属单位人员四百多人。会议上公布了贪污分子张凤鸣、黄金桓的罪行，当场由公安局把二犯逮捕，送交法院，依法处理。到会的人情绪高涨，纷纷表示有决心也有信心把这一运动胜利地推进，直到把贪污现象彻底消灭为止。
    市总工会秘书长李晨、行政处长张子荣在会上报告了张、黄的罪行。张凤鸣是新生建筑公司材料部主任，在解放区时曾于一九三九年在深县加入共产党，一九四四年因贪污粮票数百斤而畏罪潜逃，来北京当小工。一九四七年又混进党来。一九五○年调到北京市总工会的机关生产单位新生建筑公司工作。张在新生公司一年半来，曾先后贪污、受贿、偷窃等达二千八百万元。并曾挪用公款二千多万元。在浪费方面，仅木材一项，一九五一年上半年就亏损了将近二万尺（约值二亿元）。张平日生活铺张，给小孩办满月三次就用了一百多万元。平时工人不愿去材料部，管材料部叫小衙门。黄金桓是前市总工会总务科出纳股长，一贯贪污腐化。他除经常贪污工作人员生活费的尾数，一九四九年在私人钱庄存放公款二千多万元，贪污利息将近二百万元。一九五○年初，正当粮价上涨之际，黄挪用公款给奸商囤积倒把，从中取利七、八十万元。该奸商还送他手表一只，二十八万元。另外他还贪污伙食客饭费，偷工会会费，现已查明的总计有五百三十万元。在学习中，领导上曾通过开大会、小会、党员大会，个别谈话再三说明反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的意义和政策，二犯非但对贪污问题不坦白交代，反在干部及奸商中积极活动，企图掩遮蒙混过去。张凤鸣并压制民主，向要检举他的人讲“你说的有证据吗？”“你说的能负责任吗？”在十二月二十五日全体工作人员大会时，领导方面曾要黄当众检讨自己的贪污行为，他不但没参加会，并企图逃跑。后被同志们找回时，他说：“我宁死刀下，不死话下。”对于张、黄二人，领导方面已仁至义尽，而他们仍拒不坦白，甘心背叛党、背叛人民到底。
    李晨及张子荣报告后，由党总支委员会副书记刘哲民代表总支发言，指出张、黄贪污罪行严重，虽经党再三教育，他们仍一贯表现不老实，对党及人民采取对立的态度，因此已丧失共产党员的起码条件。刘哲民代表总支宣布：总支委员会同意第一支部及新生建筑公司支部意见，已呈请市委机关党委批准，开除张凤鸣、黄金桓二人的党籍。
    这时会场情绪高涨，大家纷纷发言，一致拥护党总支的决定，并认为张、黄二人盗窃国家财产，囤积倒把，背叛人民，罪行重大，建议立即将该二犯逮捕送交人民法院依法严惩，领导方面立即接受全体到会同志的要求，当场由公安局将二犯逮捕。到会同志全体起立高呼“严惩贪污分子！”“检举不老实的贪污分子！”“欢迎贪污分子坦白！”历久不息。
    最后由市总工会副主席刘莱夫、张鸿舜总结发言，说明这些贪污分子之所以能滋长，领导上要负很大责任，平时对干部的思想教育不够，被资产阶级思想所腐蚀，制度管理又不严格，给贪污分子造成有利机会，我们领导同志要深刻检讨。并指出：有些贪污分子现仍未彻底坦白，甚至企图隐瞒到底，对于这些人只有两条道路：一条路是死不坦白，要加重处分；一条路是坦白立功，则可减轻或免予处分。而第一条路是走不通的，因为群众力量是伟大的。（北京市总工会节约检查委员会办公室）
