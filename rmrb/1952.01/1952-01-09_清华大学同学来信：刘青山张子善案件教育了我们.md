    Tsinghua University Students' Letter: The Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan Case Educated Us
    Editor: The embezzlement crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, and the decision of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to expel Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party, have attracted great attention from the students of Tsinghua University. This event is of great educational significance to the students. It made everyone clearly realize the serious significance of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and further experienced the brilliance and correctness of the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Zou Pixian, a student in the fourth grade of the Department of Aeronautics, said: "Last year we worked hard and accumulated 400 million yuan in donations, while Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan embezzled so much at once." Some students said: "If the phenomena of corruption and waste are not eradicated, the increase production and practice economy movement cannot be launched!" One student said: "In the past, I only recognized the economic significance of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Today, I further understand its political significance." Zhou Yuhui said: "The Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan incident educates us that we must always be vigilant against the erosion and temptation of bourgeois ideology!" Ning Zhonglin, a student in the Department of Construction Engineering, said: "The Chinese Communist Party is great, it dares to conduct self-criticism in front of the people." In the past few days, the students have paid close attention to the articles published in the People's Daily related to the embezzlement case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, and have studied in connection with their own thoughts.

    清华大学同学来信：刘青山张子善案件教育了我们
    编辑同志：刘青山、张子善的贪污罪行和中国共产党河北省委员会关于开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决定，引起了清华大学同学的极大注意。这一事件对同学们是有很大教育意义的。它使大家清楚地认识了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的严重意义，进一步体验到毛主席、共产党领导的英明正确。航空系四年级邹丕先同学说：“去年我们辛勤劳动，积累了四亿元的捐献金，而刘青山、张子善一下就贪污了那么多。”有的同学说：“贪污浪费的现象若不根绝，增产节约运动是不可能展开的！”一位同学说：“从前我只认识到反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的经济意义，今天我进一步了解了它的政治意义。”周煜辉同学说：“刘青山、张子善事件教育我们：必须随时警惕资产阶级思想的侵蚀和引诱！”营建系宁钟琳同学说：“中国共产党是伟大的，它敢于在人民大众面前进行自我批评。”几天来同学们都很注意人民日报上发表的有关刘青山、张子善贪污案件的文章，联系自己思想进行学习。    清华大学宣传通讯组
