    Tianjin Tax Bureau and Federation of Industry and Commerce Jointly Hold Meeting
    To Mobilize Business Community to Confess and Report Tax Evasion
    Bi Mingqi, Zhu Jisheng, and Others Confessed Their Mistakes on the Spot
    In order to further promote the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in Tianjin's business community, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Tax Bureau and the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly convened a mobilization meeting for confession and reporting in the business community on the 9th. At the meeting, Bi Mingqi, deputy director of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, took the lead in confessing tax evasion and avoidance. 121 people signed up to confess or report on the spot.
    The meeting began with a report by Li Zhouxing, director of the Municipal Tax Bureau. He pointed out that bribery and tax evasion are very serious in Tianjin's business community. In September of last year, when the Tax Bureau investigated tax sources, 47.41% of industrial and commercial households in the city were found to be evading or avoiding taxes. If this situation is not changed, the country will suffer losses, the development of legitimate industry and commerce will be hindered, and the country's economic construction and national defense construction will be damaged. Therefore, industrialists and businessmen should enthusiastically participate in the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-fraud movement in the business community, and confess their mistakes. Whether industrialists and businessmen are willing to make progress is a serious test for this movement. He said: Some tax officials have already confessed to accepting bribes, and industrialists and businessmen who have engaged in bribery will not be able to hide it even if they do not talk about it.
    Then, Bi Mingqi, deputy director of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, made a mobilization report. In his report, he pointed out that although the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-fraud movement in Tianjin's business community has already begun, the actual actions are not enough, and many people are still waiting and watching. The main reason is that the leaders of the business community have not played an active leading role. He conducted a self-criticism at the meeting, confessing to tax evasion, hoarding, and speculation, and exposing his profiteering ideology. He confessed that in 1950, his company had a batch of imported goods with sales of 53.63 million yuan, and no business tax was paid on the invoices issued. In 1951, his Xinmin Chemical Plant sold more than 80 million yuan worth of raw materials, of which more than 45 million yuan was not reported for business tax. Bi Mingqi called on industrialists and businessmen to take active action and confess their bribery, tax evasion, and other behaviors.
    After the report, 121 people signed up on the spot to confess their own bribery, corruption, and other behaviors or to report on others. Zhu Jisheng, deputy director of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and general manager of Renli Industrial Company, Yang Jian'an, chairman of the Municipal Tobacco Industry Association, and Cui Shukun, chairman of the New Drug Commercial Association, made confessions at the meeting. Zhu Jisheng confessed that Renli Company underreported the price when reporting wool yarn tax, and also evaded taxes. He believes that this is an act that harms the interests of the country and the people. He hopes that everyone will be law-abiding merchants. Yang Jian'an said: Since liberation, due to his old industrial and commercial decadent ideas, selfishness, only caring about his own accumulation of wealth, and ignoring the interests of the country and the people, he has committed illegal acts of evading more than 800 million yuan in taxes. He expressed his willingness to hand over this money to the government and listen to the government's decision.
    More than 2,000 people attended the meeting, including standing committee members and executive committee members of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, directors of various industries, representatives of the business community, tax officials, and representatives of shop employees.

    Xinhua News Agency:
    Tianjin's vast number of shop employees have actively joined the struggle against corruption and bribery. According to incomplete statistics for the four days of the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th: approximately 6,460 shop employees participated in various confession and reporting meetings, and a total of 6,115 cases of corruption, bribery, tax evasion and fraud against state property were reported. On the 9th alone, 2,206 cases were reported. At the meeting, shop employees fully exposed the various despicable means used by unscrupulous merchants to bribe revolutionary cadres, and some shop employees also revealed the "back accounts" used by shops to evade taxes. These reported cases are currently being studied and processed by the Municipal Savings Inspection Committee. The large-scale reporting has made some lawless merchants and corrupt elements realize the power of the people and convinced them that failure to confess will inevitably lead to being reported, thus forcing them to quickly confess their illegal activities.
    The preliminary experience of holding successful reporting meetings includes the following: First, the responsible cadres of the shop employee unions personally preside over the meetings to eliminate the ideological concerns of the shop employees. Second, ideological preparation and deliberation work should be done before the meeting to avoid the shortcomings of shop employees feeling "sudden" and "thinking on the spot". At the first two meetings, because of the lack of prior deliberation, although many cases were reported, some shop employees regretfully said when reporting: "I didn't know that I had to report beforehand. If I knew, I would have reported more, and the situation would be more specific." Third, attention should be paid to mobilizing shop employees who know more about the inside story of corruption and bribery to participate. The Hardware Industry Union's reporting meeting reported more than 1,000 cases of corruption, bribery, etc. in one morning, mainly because most of the shop employees who participated were accounting staff and outside sales staff. When mobilizing these shop employees to participate, special attention should be paid to strengthening class education and eliminating ideological concerns.
    At present, shop employees in the 11th District and the 7th District have formed inspection teams and grassroots inspection groups by industry, with activists as the backbone, to go deep into the grassroots and vigorously mobilize members to launch a wider reporting movement.

    天津市税务局和工商联联合开会
    动员工商界坦白检举偷漏税行为
    毕鸣岐朱继圣等当场坦白了自己的错误
    为了进一步开展天津市工商界反贪污反行贿运动，天津市人民政府税务局、天津市工商业联合会在九日联合召开工商界坦白检举动员大会。会上，市工商业联合会副主任委员毕鸣岐带头坦白了偷税、漏税行为。当场有一百二十一人报名坦白或检举。
    大会首先由市税务局长李周行作报告。他指出：天津市工商界中行贿、偷税等现象十分严重。去年九月税务局调查税源时，就有占全市工商业户总数百分之四十七点四一的工商业户偷税、漏税。这种情况如不改变，国家要受到损失，正当的工商业的发展要受到阻碍，国家的经济建设和国防建设也会受到破坏。因此，工商业者应该热烈地参加工商界的反行贿、反偷税、反欺诈运动，坦白交代自己的错误。工商业者愿不愿意进步，这个运动是一个严重的考验。他说：有些税务工作干部已经坦白了受贿的事情，工商业者有行贿行为的不谈也藏不住的。
    接着由市工商业联合会副主任毕鸣岐作动员报告，他在报告中指出：天津市工商界的反行贿、反偷税、反欺诈运动虽已开始，但是实际行动还不够，许多人还在观望、等待，主要的原因是工商界负责人没有起积极的带头作用。他在会上进行了自我检讨，坦白了偷税、囤积、投机的事实，并揭露了自己的暴利思想。他坦白：一九五○年，他的公司有一批进口货，销货营业额是五千三百六十三万元，发货票开出，没有上营业税。一九五一年，他的新民化工厂售卖原料八千多万元，其中四千五百多万元未报营业税。毕鸣岐号召工商业者积极行动起来，坦白交代自己的行贿、偷税等行为。
    报告后，当场有一百二十一人报名要坦白自己或检举别人的行贿、受贿等行为。市工商业联合会副主任委员、仁立实业公司总经理朱继圣，市烟草业同业公会主任委员杨健庵，新药商业同业公会主任委员崔书琨等在大会上作了坦白。朱继圣坦白仁立公司在报毛纱税时报低了价格，也偷过税。他认为这是损害国家和人民利益的行为。他希望大家做守法商人。杨健庵说：解放以来，由于自己存在旧工商业者的腐朽思想，自私自利，只顾本身积累财富，忽视国家和人民的利益，以致发生偷税八亿多元的犯法行为。他表示愿意把这笔钱交给政府，并且听候政府的处分。
    出席大会的有市工商业联合会常务委员和执行委员、各行业主任委员、工商界代表、税收工作干部和店员代表等二千多人。　（新华社）
    天津市广大店员已积极投入反贪污、反行贿的斗争中。据六、七、八、九四天的不完全统计：参加各种坦白检举大会的店员约六千四百六十多人，共检举出各种贪污、行贿、偷税和诈骗国家财产案件达六千一百一十五件。仅九日一天内检举出的案件就有二千二百零六件。店员们在会上尽情揭发了奸商们贿赂革命干部的种种卑鄙手段，有些店员并讲出商店偷税用的“后账”。这些检举出来的案件现正由市节约检查委员会研究处理中。大张旗鼓的检举，使某些不法商人和贪污分子认识到人民的力量，信服了不坦白必被检举的道理，因而被迫赶快坦白了他们的不法行为。
    开好检举大会的初步经验有以下几点：首先是店员工会负责干部亲自主持，解除店员思想顾虑。其次，会前做好思想准备和酝酿工作，以免发生店员感到“突然”以及“临时想”等缺点。在最初召开的两次大会上，因为事前缺乏酝酿，虽然检举出不少案件，但有些店员在检举时惋惜地说：“事前不知道要检举，要知道的话，检举的会更多，情况也会更具体。”第三、要注意动员了解贪污行贿内幕较多的店员参加。五金业工会检举大会在一个上午就检举一千多件贪污、行贿等案件，主要是参加会的店员大部是会计人员和外勤售货员的缘故。动员这些店员参加，要特别注意加强阶级教育，解除思想顾虑。
    目前第十一区和第七区的店员已按行业组成了检查组和基层检查小组，以积极分子为骨干，深入基层，大力动员会员更广泛地展开检举运动。
