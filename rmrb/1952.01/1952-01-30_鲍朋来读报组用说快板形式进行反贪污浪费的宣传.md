    Bao Penglai Reading Group Uses Clapper Talk to Publicize the Fight Against Corruption and Waste

    Editor: In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, our reading group, in light of our own specific circumstances, selects materials from the newspaper to read and promptly composes clapper talks for publicity. In other words, we closely integrate our reading group activities with this great movement.

    After the movement began, there were three types of ideological situations within our group:

    (1) Those with relatively large acts of corruption were determined to refuse to confess, or only talked about small things and not big ones, distant things and not recent ones; (2) Those whose hands were a little dirty wavered between confessing and not confessing; (3) Those who had no corruption and considered themselves "clean" adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards the movement. The first type included Tan Jichang, Jiang Xurong, Lin Yizu, and others from the Repair Shop. After liberation, they stole a large number of national telecommunications equipment, gasoline, and parts, and also engaged in illegal activities such as reselling gold and silver. After the movement began, they either pretended nothing had happened or tried to soften everyone by crying. In response to these people's ideological situation, we focused on explaining the policies to them, mobilizing them to confess thoroughly, and explaining to them the two ways the Ministry of Railways dealt with corrupt elements as published in the newspaper: leniency for those who confess, and immediate arrest for those who refuse to confess. At the same time, based on the facts of their theft, we composed clapper talks to encourage them to confess. For example: "The Repair Shop is not simple, it has all kinds of tricks, reselling gold and silver, colluding with the 'gold devils,' refusing to confess when there are problems, trying to hide by crying"; "Comrades, it's really strange, the warehouse manager has problems, changing tires and bearing shells, exchanging old cars for new ones; some people still want to be slippery, stealing equipment and gasoline, if you don't confess, I'll report you, don't say I'm picking on you." For some people who talked about problems haltingly and incompletely, we composed clapper talks saying: "Talk about problems thoroughly, the organization will definitely be lenient with you, please think about it, can the eyes of the masses be blind?" Stubborn elements Tan Jichang, Jiang Xurong, and Lin Yizu have been dismissed and sent to the court for handling, even after repeated enlightenment education, they still refused to confess. For the second type of people, our propaganda and mobilization played a significant role. Zhang Jiahe and Sun Guilin were both people who confessed relatively thoroughly. At the beginning of the movement, they had agreed with merchants to not confess to each other, trying to muddle through. After reading and studying the newspaper and ideological education, and under the pressure of the mass movement, they changed. They said, "The things published in the newspaper always seem to be talking about us. Especially when we heard that the industrial and commercial sectors were also carrying out an anti-bribery movement, and shop assistants were exposing a large number of corrupt officials, we became even more worried, thinking that we might be reported by others." Therefore, they confessed to the masses. Facts have proved that only after they confessed thoroughly could they feel at ease.

    The third type of people thought they were "clean," and even if there was some waste, it was not a big deal. In response to this ideological situation, we composed some clapper talks in the voice of discarded materials to awaken them. A very vivid clapper talk popular in our bureau called "Telephone Complains" says: "My name is Telephone, in the 'Three Antis' movement, I want to expose, the transportation comrades are really damaging, grabbing my neck with one hand, we are inherently weak, our skin is smooth and slippery, my eldest brother was killed for no reason, my second brother is climbing up, only I am lucky, my back aches and my legs are numb from the fall, they don't cherish telecommunications equipment, they are letting down the people and the country, vigorously oppose waste, I hope everyone will criticize him." There are other similar clapper talks that are very vivid. Using these clapper talks for publicity has basically reversed everyone's erroneous idea of not valuing the struggle against waste.

    The Spring Festival is approaching, and our reading group is using spare time to write a "Shadow Play" about the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle in our group (the content includes scenes of activists fighting against corrupt officials and corrupt officials refusing to confess and being brought to justice, as well as proposing plans to increase production and practice thrift), and plans to perform it at the bureau's Spring Festival evening party.

    鲍朋来读报组用说快板形式进行反贪污浪费的宣传
    编辑同志：我们读报组在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，针对本组的实际情况，选读报纸上的材料，并及时地编写快板，进行宣传。这就是说，把读报组的活动和这个伟大运动密切地配合起来了。
    运动开始后，我们组内存在着三种思想情况：
    （一）有比较大的贪污罪行的人，抱定拒不坦白的态度；或谈小不谈大，谈远不谈近；（二）手脚有点不干净的人，动摇在坦白和不坦白之间；（三）没有贪污行为，自认“清白”的人，对运动采取自由主义的态度。第一种人像修机室的谭继昌、姜绪荣、林翼祖等，他们在解放后偷了国家大批电讯器材、汽油和零件，还进行捣卖金银的非法活动。他们在运动开始后，或装着若无其事，或哭哭啼啼地想来软化大家。我们针对这些人的思想情况，着重地向他们讲解政策，动员他们彻底坦白，向他们解释报纸上登载的铁道部对贪污分子处理的两种方式：坦白者从轻处理；拒不坦白者当场逮捕。同时，根据他们的偷盗的事实，编出快板，启发他们坦白。像“修机室不简单，五行八招都齐全，捣卖黄金和银元，跟‘金鬼子’相串联，有问题不交代，哭哭啼啼想隐瞒”；“同志们，真稀奇，管仓库的有问题，换车带和轴皮，旧车换辆新车骑；有人还要耍滑头，器材汽油他都偷，你不坦白我检举，别说我和你过不去”。对某些谈问题吞吞吐吐不彻底的人，就编快板说：“谈问题，要彻底，组织一定宽大你，请想一想，群众的眼睛能不亮？”顽固分子谭继昌、姜绪荣、林翼祖虽然经过多次启发教育，仍不坦白，已被撤职，送往法院法办。对于第二种人，我们的宣传鼓动起了很大的作用。张嘉和、孙贵林都是坦白得比较彻底的人。他们在运动刚开始时，曾和商人约定，互不交代，企图混过这一关。经过读报学习和思想教育，并在群众运动的压力下，他们转变了。他们说：“报纸上登的事，总像是说我们似的。尤其是听到工商界也在开展反行贿运动，店员大量揭发贪污犯时，更提心吊胆，说不定自己就被别人检举了。”因此，他们向群众作了交代。事实证明，他们只有在彻底坦白以后，才可能安下心来。
    第三种人以为自己“清白”，即使有些浪费，也不是什么大不了的事情。我们针对着这种思想情况，编出了一些废料自述的快板来唤醒他们。本局流行的一首“电话告状”的快板很生动：“我的姓名叫电话，‘三反’运动中我要来揭发，搬运的同志真叫损，一手把我的脖子搯，我们身体本来弱，皮肤又光还又滑，大哥无故被摔死，二哥正在往上爬，只有我还算侥幸，跌得腰酸腿又麻，电讯器材他不爱护，对不起人民和国家，大张旗鼓反浪费，希望大家批评他。”还有一些类似的快板，都非常生动。用这些快板作宣传，基本上扭转了大家不重视反浪费斗争的错误思想。
    春节快要到了，我们读报组正在利用空闲时间，把本组反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争情况编写成“拉洋片”（内容包括积极分子向贪污犯进行斗争及贪污分子拒不坦白俯首就擒等场面，并提出增产节约的计划），准备在本局的春节晚会上演出。
