    The Xuzhou Electric Power Bureau Should Not Disregard Collective Contracts
    To the Editor: The Xuzhou Electric Power Bureau's lack of attention to already-signed collective contracts has affected the production morale of its employees. The Jiawang Power Plant of the Xuzhou Electric Power Bureau submitted the safe operation and maintenance contract signed by the administration and the trade union in the fourth quarter of 1950 to the Electric Power Bureau for approval. The Electric Power Bureau delayed approval for a long time, eventually replying: "The content of the contract is not specific enough; revise it and resubmit." By the time it was revised and resubmitted, it was already December, and the contract never took effect. In September 1951, when the power plant overhauled Boiler No. 1, the administration and the trade union signed another collective maintenance contract, and the employees completed the task on time. Afterwards, the administrative side of the Electric Power Bureau said: "The summary content is not specific or clear; the power plant should rewrite it and resubmit it." This collective contract also fell through. In the same month, when the power plant overhauled Units No. 6 and No. 8, the administrative and trade union sides signed a collective contract and filed it with the Labor Bureau. The plant's administration and trade union also guaranteed the employees that the contract would be implemented. At that time, due to insufficient electricity in Xuzhou City at night, diesel engines had to be started, consuming three extra barrels of diesel fuel each day. In order to repair Unit No. 6, deliver electricity earlier, and save diesel fuel, the workers completed the originally scheduled fifteen-day rush repair task in twelve days. However, the Xuzhou Electric Power Bureau still did not implement the contract, again saying that the summary material was not practical, lacked content, and that safe operation was not guaranteed, and rejected the contract. Other collective contracts, such as the overhaul of Boiler No. 3, Boiler No. 7, and Unit No. 2, were also signed, and the employees completed the tasks on time or ahead of schedule, but the Xuzhou Electric Power Bureau did not fulfill the contracts. Subsequently, because the signed contracts repeatedly could not be honored, the administration and trade union of the Jiawang Power Plant dared not sign any more contracts. This situation has seriously affected the production morale of the employees, who have repeatedly asked the Xuzhou Electric Power Bureau to express its attitude on this issue. I believe that the Xuzhou Electric Power Bureau should pay attention to the opinions of the employees.    Zhao Ruixiang

### 徐州电业局不应忽视集体合同

    徐州电业局不应忽视集体合同
    编辑同志：徐州电业局不重视已签订的集体合同，影响了职工的生产情绪。徐州电业局贾汪发电厂把行政和工会在一九五○年第四季签订的安全运转和检修合同，送到电业局批准，电业局拖了很久才批下来说：“合同内容不具体，从新修订后再送。”等到修订后再送去，时间已到了十二月，合同根本没有生效。一九五一年九月，发电厂大修一号炉，行政和工会又签订了检修集体合同，职工按时完成了任务。事后，电业局行政方面却说：“总结内容不具体、不明确，发电厂应重写后送去。”这次集体合同又落了空。同月，发电厂大修六号机和八号机，行政和工会方面签订了集体合同，并向劳动局备案，厂里的行政和工会并向职工保证执行合同。当时，因徐州市晚上电力不足，需开柴油机，每天多费柴油三大桶。工人们为了修好六号机，提早送电，节约柴油，把原定十五天的抢修任务，在十二天内就完成了。但徐州电业局仍不执行合同，又说总结材料不实际，没有内容，安全运转没有保证等，把合同批驳了。其他如大修三号炉、七号炉、二号机等，都签订了集体合同，职工按期或超额完成了任务，但徐州电业局却没有履行合同。以后，由于签订的合同屡次不能兑现，致使贾汪发电厂的行政和工会不敢再订合同了。这种情况严重地影响了职工的生产情绪，他们纷纷要求徐州电业局对这个问题表明态度。我认为徐州电业局应重视职工的意见。    赵瑞祥
