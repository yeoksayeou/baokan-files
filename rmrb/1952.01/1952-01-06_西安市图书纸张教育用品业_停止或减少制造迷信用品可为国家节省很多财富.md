To the Editor: In order to respond to Chairman Mao's great call for increasing production and practicing economy, our Xi'an Books, Paper, and Educational Supplies Trade Association held an industry conference on November 19th and 20th, 1951. According to the demands of the members, the conference unanimously passed a resolution to stop manufacturing superstitious items, such as yellow paper, tin foil, "dazhi" paper, ghost money, and various god statues and spirit money, and to use this part of the funds and manpower in legitimate business.

The annual consumption of these superstitious items is quite staggering. According to incomplete statistics in Xi'an, the annual consumption of just six superstitious items, including yellow paper, tin foil, five-color soft paper, five-color waxed pointed paper, various god statues, and ghost money, amounts to 12.15 billion yuan. If we were to tally the figures for the consumption of superstitious items in provinces, cities, and counties across the country, the number would be even more astonishing.

We hope that colleagues across the country will work together to reduce or even stop manufacturing these superstitious items, in order to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to support the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    停止或减少制造迷信用品可为国家节省很多财富
    编辑同志：为了响应毛主席增产节约的伟大号召，我们西安市图书纸张教育用品业公会在一九五一年十一月十九、二十两日，召开了行业会议。会议根据会员的要求，一致通过停止制造迷信品，如黄表、锡箔、打纸、冥票和各种神像、神钱等，而把这部分资金和人力用在正当业务上。
    这种迷信品每年的消耗数字是相当惊人的。据西安市不完全的统计，只黄表、锡箔、五色软纸、五色腊尖纸、各种神像和冥票等六项迷信品，全年消耗就有一百二十一亿五千万元。如果把全国各省、市、县消耗于迷信品的数字统计起来，就更加惊人了。
    我们希望全国同业，共同努力减少以至停止制造这些迷信品，以增加生产，厉行节约，为支持中国人民志愿军而努力。
        西安市图书纸张教育用品商业同业公会
