The Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 124 has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Strengthen the Struggle Against the Militarization of the Economy and the Impoverishment of the Working People in Capitalist Countries," which states: The US-British imperialist aggressive bloc is frantically preparing for a new world war. The unprecedented large-scale militarization of the economy in capitalist countries has caused a sharp decline in the living conditions and wages of workers. The profits of monopoly capitalists are appalling. Truman reported to the US Congress that US companies' profits in 1951 would reach 50 billion US dollars, more than double the average during World War II. Imperialist ruling oligarchs want to deceive the people by portraying militarization and war as the road to economic prosperity and full employment. But in 1950, 15.2 million people in the United States were completely or partially unemployed, and in September 1951 alone, the number of unemployed increased by one million. In 1950, the number of people completely or partially unemployed in capitalist countries totaled 45 million. US and British war propagandists are touting the theory of "overpopulation," but the countries participating in the Atlantic aggressive bloc will spend a total of 190 billion US dollars in the fiscal year 1951-1952, which is enough to maintain the lives of all the unemployed and their families in the entire capitalist world. The editorial continues: The development of military industries in capitalist countries inevitably leads to an increase in the cost of living. In the year of the aggression against the Korean War, the cost of living in the United States increased by 14 percent, and in Britain by 25 percent. Economic militarization and the impoverishment of the masses have led to a growing organized resistance from the working people. According to official US materials, the average number of strikes per year during the five years after the war increased two-fold compared to a period between the two world wars. Many strikes have taken place in Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Austria and other countries. The struggle of the working people in capitalist countries for their lives is closely linked with the worldwide movement for peace. All laboring and honorable people, righteous and progressive people, demand an end to the war of aggression against Korea. The vanguard of the working class, the Communist Party, leads the masses to fight for their vital interests, and they will surely defeat the conspiracies of the new war makers.

This issue publishes a lengthy essay by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, entitled "The Only Correct Road for Humanity," discussing the world situation after the October Revolution. Togliatti said: The October Revolution took place in one of the darkest periods in modern human history. After power was transferred to the hands of the exploited and oppressed people, they began to build a new state, using this state as a tool for building a new society. After the October Revolution, the Soviet economy continued to progress, and there has been no crisis for more than 30 years. Industry has been established, agriculture has been transformed, unemployment, poverty, illiteracy and ignorance have been eliminated, and two invasions have been repelled and two victories won. What is particularly important is that the people who have seized power are their own masters, cultivating their civic consciousness by constantly discussing, learning, and collectively solving all production problems. Labor has for the first time become something glorious and the source of all benefits. Women enjoy equal rights with men. Young people are full of confidence in their future, free from the threat of violence, economic crises, and being used as cannon fodder. But on the other hand, outside the Soviet Union and countries that have learned from the Soviet Union, there are no other places in the world that have implemented profound democratic reforms. Togliatti emphasized that democracy and socialism have already triumphed in vast parts of the world. Today, as at all the crucial moments in this historical period since the victory of the October Revolution, the only correct road for humanity is the road pointed out to the world by the Soviet Union and Stalin.

This issue publishes an article by Petru Groza, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic, entitled "The People's Councils of the Romanian People's Republic." Groza pointed out that the People's Councils are the most democratic local organs of power in Romania, guaranteeing the participation of the masses, who enjoy full rights, in the administration of the country. The creative suggestions of the representatives of the People's Councils and the activists in social activities are a great force in promoting the realization of the plans for national industrialization and the transformation of the countryside according to the socialist path. However, the People's Councils have not yet fully utilized the infinite creativity of the masses. Therefore, absorbing all the representatives to participate in more active work, and absorbing more activists from the ranks of workers, peasants and intellectuals - this is the urgent task of the People's Councils.

This issue also publishes an article by Rodney Arismendi, a Central Committee member of the Communist Party of Uruguay, entitled "Latin America Under the Iron Heel of US Monopoly Capital." The author says that after World War II, the US government used a series of agreements to implement military control over Latin American countries and manipulate their state machines. The Latin American landlords and big bourgeoisie colluded with US monopoly capitalists to turn their countries into dependent countries that supply the United States with agricultural products and raw materials. Under their cruel exploitation, most workers and peasants in Latin America live in slavery, working fifteen to twenty hours a day. The proletariat and peasants of Latin American countries are fighting for peace, democracy and independence. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二四期介绍
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二四期已经出版。
    本期发表题为“加强斗争反对资本主义国家经济的军事化和劳动人民的贫困化”的社论说：美英帝国主义侵略集团正在疯狂地准备新的世界大战。资本主义国家经济的空前大规模的军事化，已经引起工人生活条件和工人工资的急剧下降。垄断资本家的利润是骇人听闻的，杜鲁门向美国国会报告说：一九五一年美国各公司的利润将达五百亿美元，超过了第二次世界大战期间的平均数一倍以上。帝国主义统治寡头想把军事化和战争说成是走向经济繁荣和充分就业的道路，以蒙蔽人民。但是一九五○年美国有一千五百二十万人完全失业或部分失业，一九五一年单是九月份失业人数就增加了一百万。一九五○年资本主义国家完全失业或部分失业的人数共计四千五百万。美英战争宣传家正在鼓吹“人口过剩”论，但参加大西洋侵略集团的国家，在一九五一到一九五二这个财政年度共将花费一千九百亿美元，这个数目足够维持全资本主义世界的一切失业者和家庭的生活。社论接着说：资本主义国家军事工业的发展不可避免地引起了生活费用的增加，在侵略朝鲜战争的一年中，美国生活费用增加了百分之十四，英国增加了百分之二十五。经济军事化和人民群众的贫困，已使劳动人民的有组织的反抗日益增长。根据美国官方材料，战后的五年期间和两次世界大战之间的一个时期比较，每年平均罢工人数增加了两倍。英、法、意大利、日本、奥地利和其他国家都举行了很多次罢工。资本主义国家劳动人民为生活的斗争，和全世界争取和平的运动密切结合。一切劳动和光荣的人民，正义和进步的人民，都要求停止侵略朝鲜的战争。工人阶级的先锋队共产党领导群众为他们的切身利益而斗争，他们一定能战败新战争制造者的阴谋。
    本期刊载了意大利共产党总书记托里亚蒂的长篇论文“人类的唯一正确道路”，论述十月革命以后的世界形势。托里亚蒂说：十月革命发生在人类近代历史上的一个最黑暗的时期。政权转入受剥削和受压迫的人民的手中后，他们就开始建设新国家，用这个国家作为建设新社会的工具。十月革命后，苏联经济不断进步，三十多年来一直没有危机，工业建立了，农业改变了，失业、贫穷、文盲和愚昧消灭了，击退了两次侵略，打了两次胜仗。尤其重要的是：掌握了政权的人民自己当家作主人，以经常讨论、学习和集体解决一切生产问题的办法来培养他们的公民意识。劳动第一次成为光荣的东西和一切利益的泉源。妇女享有和男子平等的权利。青年对自己的前途满怀信心，既不受暴力的威胁，也不受经济危机和当炮灰的威胁。但在另外一面，在苏联以及学习苏联榜样的国家以外，世界上没有其他地方实行了深刻的民主改革。托里亚蒂强调说：民主和社会主义已经在世界上的广大地方取得了胜利。今天，正如十月革命胜利以来这段历史时期的一切决定关头一样，人类唯一正确的道路就是苏联和斯大林向世界指出的道路。
    本期发表了罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席格罗查的“罗马尼亚人民共和国的人民委员会”一文。格罗查指出：人民委员会是罗马尼亚最民主的地方政权机关，保证享有充分权利的群众参加国家的管理工作。人民委员会的代表和社会活动中的积极分子的创造性建议，是促使国家工业化和按照社会主义方针改造农村的计划付诸实现的伟大力量。但是，人民委员会还没有充分利用群众的无限创造力。因此，吸收所有的代表参加更积极的工作，从工人、农民和知识分子的行列中吸收更多的积极分子——这就是各人民委员会的迫切任务。
    本期还刊载了乌拉圭共产党中央委员阿里斯孟第的“在美国垄断资本铁蹄下的拉丁美洲”一文，作者说：第二次世界大战以后，美国政府利用一连串的协定，使美国政府在拉丁美洲各国实行军事控制，并且操纵它们的国家机器；拉丁美洲的地主和大资产阶级与美国垄断资本家勾结在一起，把自己的国家变成供给美国以农产品和原料的附属国。在他们的残酷剥削下，拉丁美洲大多数工人和农民生活在奴隶状况中，每日劳动十五到二十小时。拉丁美洲各国的无产阶级和农民正在进行斗争，争取和平、民主和独立。（新华社）
