Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th. Cultural circles in South China and Guangzhou held a grand meeting on the 13th to strongly protest the Hong Kong British government's unreasonable and barbarous action of expelling eight Chinese film artists, including Sima Wensen, Qi Wenshao, Ma Guoliang, Liu Qiong, Shu Shi, Yang Hua, Shen Ji, and Di Fan. At the meeting, Ouyang Shan, Chairman of the South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, first extended a warm welcome and cordial greetings to the eight film artists who had been persecuted. Ouyang Shan pointed out: The fact that the Hong Kong British government expelled Chinese film artists proves that the Hong Kong British imperialists are attempting to use brutal means to undermine and suppress the patriotic movement of our compatriots. However, their conspiracy will surely be bankrupted by the just struggle of our Hong Kong compatriots, who are supported by the people of the whole country. Ouyang Shan, on behalf of the cultural circles in South China, lodged a stern protest against this crazy act of violence by the Hong Kong British government. Subsequently, the eight persecuted film artists reported on their arrest and deportation from Hong Kong. All those present expressed extreme anger at the Hong Kong British government's barbarity and unreasonableness.

At the meeting, a letter of protest from the cultural circles of South China against the Hong Kong British government's unreasonable persecution of patriotic Chinese film artists was adopted. The protest letter pointed out: We cannot tolerate this crazy and shameless behavior of British imperialism. British imperialism must bear all the consequences and responsibilities for this unreasonable act.
