Correct the "Padding Budgets for Flexible Use" Mentality in Capital Construction, Launch a Production Increase and Economy Campaign
    Wang Xijun

    I.
    Strictly and accurately preparing project budgets is a very important issue in carrying out the production increase and economy campaign and eliminating waste in capital construction. At present, the project budgets prepared by some public and private construction enterprises greatly exceed the actual needs of the project, thus causing or contributing to the accumulation and waste of funds and materials.
    For a project built in Beijing in 1950, a certain construction company prepared a budget of 738,038,000 yuan. After careful review by the competent authority, the budget was changed to 585,608,100 yuan, and the construction was still contracted to the same construction company. Because new project items were added to the revised budget, the budget prepared by the company was actually 31 percent higher than the later contract price. For a new office building project with a total construction area of 3,000 square meters that started in June 1951, the budget of a certain construction company was 323,846,393 yuan higher than the contract price it later undertook. Because some project items in the contract price were increased compared with the original budget, the original budget was about 15 percent higher than the contract price.
    Even these budgets, which have been strictly reviewed and greatly reduced as contract prices, are still higher than actual needs. Taking the above-mentioned new office building project as an example, the surplus of blue four-ding bricks (laying four bricks vertically with a horizontal brick on top to form a "T" shape) alone was more than 60,000 pieces, with a value of about one-tenth of the original budget.
    The discrepancy between these two project budgets and actual needs is not the most prominent situation in the projects I have encountered. These two projects and their budgets were made by the two largest state-owned construction companies in the capital, so they are representative to a certain extent.
    This "padding budgets for flexible use" style of budget preparation has caused the project costs of new construction projects in the capital in 1951 to greatly exceed the cost stipulated uniformly by the competent department. For example, the new construction project of a certain school had the same start date and total budget as the new office building project mentioned above, but the completed construction area was one-sixth less and the quality was lower.
    This is a serious problem. If the average of our project budgets exceeds the actual needs by 10 percent, then hundreds of billions or even trillions of wealth will be accumulated and wasted every year.

    II.
    Project budgets that exceed actual needs are usually caused by the following situations:
    (1) Increasing the quantity of work. Add some so-called "safety quantities" to the calculated actual quantity of work to prevent "underestimation." However, when calculating the actual quantity of work, the amount that should be deducted is not deducted. For example, when calculating the number of bricks for a brick wall, many empty spaces such as doorways, window openings, and tie beams are not deducted, saying that this is a "convention" or "old rule." For walls with different thicknesses at the top and bottom, they are not calculated separately, but are calculated according to the thickest part, or only a little is deducted after the calculation is completed. Such a calculation method will naturally only result in more.
    (2) Increasing the unit consumption of labor and materials: For example, the amount of bricks used for each square meter of brick wall is increased to 500 or more (generally 300).
    (3) Increasing the material loss rate. Each cubic meter of logs is calculated at only 250 feet or less of finished timber, with a loss rate of more than 40 percent (the general loss rate is 33 percent). When using finished timber, a loss rate of 20 percent is still calculated. The loss rate of other materials is also often set at about 10 percent.
    (4) Increasing the unit price of labor and materials. In the aforementioned construction project, in the budget prepared by a certain construction company, the price of wired glass required for the project was quoted at 50,000 yuan per square foot, but it was purchased at 18,000 yuan per square foot. Recently, the quotation submitted by a certain construction company quoted 250,000 yuan for a "tapula" (likely a transliteration of a heating part) of heating parts, but the market price was less than 70,000 yuan. Although the unit price of major materials such as bricks, wood, cement, and reinforcing steel is less different, a slight increase has a great impact on the budget because of the large demand.
    (5) Increasing management expenses. The expenses for management fees, taxes, tool miscellaneous fees, and other items other than project labor and materials are increased to more than 15 percent of the direct expenses of the project.

    III.
    From the above specific situations, since some surplus materials and labor have been included in the budget, any behavior that wastes materials and labor will become legal. Raising the unit price of labor and materials encourages the phenomenon of rushing to purchase and hoard materials in procurement and supply work, and even encourages the corrupt behavior of some people. Also, because it is easy to obtain profits and "savings" results with an oversized budget, it hinders the comrades from doing a better job of careful calculation. Budgets that exceed actual needs will inevitably cause the state's funds and materials to be accumulated for a long time; it will inevitably lead to the sluggishness, abuse, or traveling phenomenon of bulk building materials.
    Accurate project budgets, in addition to saving project investment and limiting wasteful behavior, also have a more positive effect on the project. Because from an accurate budget, we can see whether the selection of project materials is economical and whether the specific project practices and configurations are appropriate. In this way, there will be a certain inspection effect on the project design. In addition, accurate budgets can also provide reliable data for project design, making project design more economical and perfect. For example, the houses constructed uniformly in the capital in 1951 stipulated that brick-wood structures should be mainly used, but some units found that steel-concrete structures were cheaper than brick-wood structures after accurate calculation and valuation. The aforementioned new office building project is one example of this. After this step, the roof, floor, girder, beam, column, lintel, etc. were all made of steel-concrete structure, which improved the quality of the project.

    IV.
    Some comrades say: "Under our current conditions, there are no standard labor and material quotas, and the material specifications are inconsistent, so the budget cannot be accurate." This is not the case. Inaccurate budgets are produced under the work style of "padding budgets for flexible use" and "almost." Preparing and tolerating project budgets that exceed actual needs are concrete manifestations of irresponsibility to the people's wealth.
    When I was studying and revising the budget of the new construction project mentioned above with an engineer from a certain construction company, and pointed out some parts that exceeded the actual needs, the answer I got was: "Padding budgets for flexible use, estimating a little more, just in case." I have encountered several similar situations and heard similar statements. This makes me feel that the comrades who prepared the "padding budgets for flexible use" budgets have not taken responsibility for their work.
    Some comrades also said: "The budget should be wider, it's all public funds, we can 'reimburse actual expenses,' and the rest belongs to you." In fact, "reimbursing actual expenses" without accurate budgets and strict management will inevitably lead to a situation where we spend as much as we count, resulting in waste. In addition, some comrades said: "The meat is rotten in the pot, we earn money for the public anyway, and it doesn't go into our personal pockets!" So they righteously asked the person who was studying the budget with him: "Why are you still arguing about this little bit of numbers?" This mentality is the main reason why the budget exceeds actual needs. Coupled with the mentality of "not accounting after completing the task" and the purely profit-oriented view of some leading cadres of enterprises, it has also fueled the trend of "padding budgets for flexible use" in the preparation of project budgets.
    Of course, preparing an accurate or nearly accurate project budget is more difficult than preparing a "padding budgets for flexible use" budget. It requires a series of scientific and careful work; it requires mastering more specific materials, such as the performance, specifications, and prices of materials, and the work quotas of workers; it requires improving and doing a good job of procurement and supply work; it requires accurate or relatively accurate project cost accounting; and it requires a more reasonable organization of on-site construction manpower, and improving management methods, etc. Therefore, the process of seriously preparing project budgets and striving for budget accuracy is also a process of construction enterprises themselves improving their work and making their operations more scientific. In this way, we can not only avoid wasting state investment, but also promote the progress and development of the enterprise itself.
    Therefore, the comrades responsible for this work, especially the leading cadres of enterprises, should realize the huge impact of project budgets on the project itself and the entire national economic construction; correct the purely profit-oriented view of relying on large budgets to obtain profits and the irresponsible work style; and seriously and carefully prepare project budgets. At the same time, the departments in charge of project budgets must also seriously review project budgets, correct the "padding budgets for flexible use" style in project budgets, and promote the production increase and economy campaign in capital construction.

    纠正基本建设中编造预算的“宽打窄用”思想，开展增产节约运动
    王希浚
    一
    严格地准确地编造工程预算，是在基本建设中开展增产节约运动、消灭浪费的一个很重要的问题。目前，某些公私营建筑企业所编造的工程预算，大大地超出工程的实际需要，因而造成了或助长了资金、材料的积压和浪费。
    一九五○年度在北京修建的某项工程，某建筑公司编造的预算是七亿三千八百零三万八千元。主管机关认真审查后，把预算改为五亿八千五百六十万八千一百元，仍由这个建筑公司包工承建。因为在修改了的预算中，还增加了新的工程项目，所以，某公司编造的预算实际上超出它后来包价的百分之三十一。一九五一年六月开工的总建筑面积三千平方公尺的某机关新建工程，某建筑公司的预算，也比它后来承作的包价高出三亿二千三百八十四万六千三百九十三元。因为在包价中工程项目比原来预算的增加了一些，所以原预算高出包价约百分之十五。
    就是这些经过严格审查，大大地减缩了的作为包价的预算，仍是比实际需要高的。就以上面所说的某机关新建工程来说，只蓝四丁砖（砌砖时把四块砖竖立，上面加一块横砖，成丁字形）一项，就剩余了六万多块，价值约为原预算数的十分之一。
    上面举出的这两个工程预算和实际需要出入的情况，在我接触的工程中，并不是最突出的。这两项工程和它们的预算，都是首都两家最大的公营建筑公司作的，因此有一定的代表性。
    这些“宽打窄用”的编造预算的作风，使一九五一年首都新建工程的工程造价，都大大地超过了主管部门统一规定的造价。如某学校的新建工程，它的开工日期，总预算和前面所说的某机关的新建工程相同，但完成的建筑面积却少了六分之一，质量也比较低。
    这是一个严重的问题。假使我们的大部分工程预算平均超过实际需要的百分之十，那每年将有成百亿、成千亿的财富，被积压和浪费。
    二
    超出实际需要的工程预算，通常是在下面的这些情形下造成的：
    （一）增加工程数量。在已算好的实际工程数量上，再加上若干所谓“安全数量”，以防“估漏了”。但在计算实际工程数量时，该减的也不减去，如算砖墙用砖数量时，很多的门洞、窗洞、交圈梁等空心地方，都不减去，说这是“惯例”“老规矩”。对上下厚度不同的墙，也不分别计算，一律按厚的部分计算，或者只在算好后减去一点。这样的算法，自然是只多不少。
    （二）提高单位工料用量：比如把每一平方公尺砖墙的用砖数量，提高到五百块或五百块以上（一般是三百块）。
    （三）加大材料损耗率。把每一立方公尺的原木，只按出成材二百五十呎或更少的来计算，损耗率达百分之四十以上（一般的损耗率是百分之三十三）。在使用成材木料时，仍计算百分之二十的损耗率。把其它材料的损耗率，也常订为百分之十左右。
    （四）提高工料单价。在前述的修建工程中，某建筑公司编造的预算中，曾把工程中所需的铅丝玻璃，每方呎开价五万元，但一万八千元一呎就买到了。最近某建筑公司开出的估价单，把暖气零件“搭拉浦”开价二十五万元一支，但市价还不到七万元。在砖、木、水泥、铁筋等主要材料方面，虽然单价出入较小，但因需要量多，所以稍一抬高，对预算的影响是很大的。
    （五）增加管理费用。把工程工料以外的管理费、税款、工具杂费等项开支，提高到工程直接开支的百分之十五以上。
    三
    从上面的这一些具体情况来看，既然把一些多余的材料和人工都编进了预算，那么，就会使一切浪费材料和人工的行为，成为合法的了。提高工料的单价，助长了采购供应工作中抢购、囤积材料的现象，甚至助长了某些人的贪污行为。又因为预算做得过大，利润和“节约”成绩，是容易取得的，因而就妨碍了工作同志们更好地精打细算。超出实际需要的预算，必然使国家资金、材料遭受长期积压；必然造成大宗建筑材料的呆滞、滥用或旅行的现象。
    准确的工程预算，除了可以节约工程投资和限制浪费行为以外，对工程还有更积极的作用。因为从准确的预算中，我们可以看出，工程材料的选用，是不是经济；具体工程的作法、配置，是不是恰当。这样，对于工程设计，会有一定的检查作用。另外，准确的预算，还可给工程设计提供可靠的资料，使工程设计更加经济完美。像一九五一年度首都统一建筑的房屋，曾规定主要采用砖木结构，但有的单位，在精确地计算和估价之后，发现铁筋水泥结构的建筑比砖木结构的省钱。如前面所说的某机关新建工程，就是经过了这一个步骤，把屋面、楼板、柁、梁、柱、过梁等全部采用了铁筋水泥结构，而提高了工程质量。
    四
    有的同志说：“在目前我们的条件下，标准的工料定额还没有，材料规格又不一致，因此预算不可能准确。”事实不是这样。不准确的预算是在“宽打窄用”、“差不多”的工作作风下产生的。编造和容忍超出实际需要的工程预算，都是对人民财富不负责任的具体表现。
    我在和某建筑公司的某工程师研究修改前面提出的那个新建工程的预算，并指出其中某些超出实际需要数量的部分时，得到的回答是：“宽打窄用，估富裕点，以防万一。”我曾遇到若干类似这样的情况，并听到类似的说法。这使我感到编造“宽打窄用”预算的同志，他们并没有对他们自己的工作负起责任来。
    又有的同志说：“预算应该宽点，都是公家的，我们可以‘实报实销’，剩下的归你们。”其实，离开准确的预算和严格的管理的“实报实销”，必然形成花多少算多少的局面，而造成浪费。另外还有的同志说：“肉烂在锅里，我们赚钱也是公家的，并不入个人腰包！”于是他们理直气壮地斥问和他研究预算的人：“您为什么还在这一点数字上斤斤计较呢？”这种思想是预算超出实际需要的主要原因。加上若干企业的领导干部，也有“完成任务不算账”的思想和单纯利润观点，也就助长了编造工程预算中“宽打窄用”的风气。
    固然，要编造一个准确或接近准确的工程预算，比起编造一个“宽打窄用”的预算是困难一些的。它需要有一系列的科学的认真的工作；需要掌握更多的具体材料，如材料的性能、规格、价格、工人的工作定额等；需要改进并作好采购和供应工作；需要精确或比较精确的工程成本计算；并且要更合理地组织现场施工人力，改进经营的方法等等。因此，严肃地编造工程预算，争取预算准确的过程，也就是建筑企业本身改进工作，使经营更科学化的过程。这样，不仅可以避免浪费国家投资，并且可以推动企业本身进步和发展。
    因此，负责这个工作的同志，尤其是企业的领导干部，应认识到工程预算对工程本身及整个国家经济建设所起的巨大影响；纠正依靠大预算取得利润的单纯营利观点，和不负责任的工作作风，严肃地认真地编造工程预算。同时，主管工程预算的部门，也必须严肃地审查工程预算，纠正工程预算中的“宽打窄用”作风，推动基本建设中的增产节约运动。
