    Resolutely Repulse the Wild Onslaught of the Bourgeoisie
    —Worker's Daily Editorial on the 18th

    On the 14th of this month, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held another meeting of all staff members of its directly affiliated organs. Vice-Chairman Liu Ningyi summarized the recent anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement within the various units of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and further clarified the nature and direction of the movement. This meeting will not only mobilize the staff of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, pushing the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the organs of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to a deeper and fuller stage, but will also further mobilize the masses of workers across the country to launch a serious struggle against the reactionary, ugly thoughts and behaviors of the bourgeoisie.

    Comrade Bo Yibo clearly pointed out in his report on January 9th: "The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is essentially a struggle against the decadent and degenerate thinking of the bourgeoisie. It is a resolute counter-offensive against the wild onslaught launched by the bourgeoisie against the working class and the Chinese Communist Party over the past three years, to suppress this reactionary offensive, and to give the bourgeoisie's reactionary, ugly thoughts and behaviors political reform and legal sanctions. Only in this way can the victory of the revolution be guaranteed. This is a serious class struggle, and we must achieve victory in this struggle." In Vice-Chairman Liu Ningyi's report, many serious facts were profoundly revealed about the bourgeoisie's offensive against our working class over the past three years. In order to achieve their selfish and despicable goals, the bourgeoisie dared to restrict the activities of our trade unions, divide the unity of our working class, and even send their lackeys into our trade unions to buy off, entice, and threaten... They feared that the trade unions would unite and educate the working masses to expose their despicable and filthy crimes, and launched a wild onslaught against us. Our working class masses across the country must recognize the historical significance of the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, recognize the ugly face of the bourgeoisie, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, actively and bravely carry out this serious class struggle.

    Based on the existing materials, there are indeed many phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the current trade union organs and among trade union cadres. Why are there still phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy among the working class masses and their trade union leading organs? Is this because our working class and trade union organs were originally so bad? No, it is not. As Comrade Bo Yibo pointed out in his report, the emergence of this phenomenon is "on the one hand, because after the victory of the revolution, a large number of old reactionary government personnel with old ideas and styles who had not had time to be reformed joined the People's Government and state-owned enterprises." There are also such retained personnel in our trade union organs who have not yet undergone ideological reform. They are still the same, and they engage in corruption and waste whenever they have the opportunity. "On the other hand, and more importantly, it is because after the victory of the revolution, in a peaceful environment, many comrades within our Party, government, army, and the people's democratic united front, especially many leading comrades, did not fully guard against the corrosive effects of bourgeois ideology on the revolution." Many comrades in our trade union organs have been more or less corroded by bourgeois ideology!

    Workers across the country should all understand that corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are not the thoughts and behaviors of the working class, but the thoughts and behaviors of the bourgeoisie. The working class relies on its own labor for a living. The essence of the working class is diligence, simplicity, selflessness, loyalty, firmness, and a glorious tradition of revolutionary history. Our working class has always been under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, becoming the leading class of the Chinese revolution. Our trade unions have also always been under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, becoming the Party's loyal assistant, and after the national victory, even more so, an important pillar of the people's democratic regime. We not only bear the responsibility of leading the Chinese revolution to victory, but also bear the major historical mission of leading the people of the whole country to complete the new democracy and further move towards socialism.

    What is the essence of the bourgeoisie? Although "the Chinese national bourgeoisie today has its positive and progressive side... some of their representatives participated in or sympathized with the people's liberation struggle to a certain extent during a certain period. After liberation, they gradually participated in the construction of the people's China and played a certain positive role under the leadership of the state; but the Chinese national bourgeoisie also has its dark and corrupt side, that is, because they have inextricable links with imperialist, feudal, and bureaucratic-comprador economies. At the same time, the Chinese bourgeoisie itself, like the bourgeoisie of all countries in the world, has the essence of being profit-oriented, harming others to benefit oneself, and engaging in speculation and opportunism." (Report by Vice-Chairman Zhou Enlai at the 34th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) The masses of workers and staff across the country must understand that the bourgeoisie is an exploiting class, and must understand the essence of the class pointed out by Premier Zhou and Comrade Bo Yibo. After liberation, some people in the bourgeoisie, in order to achieve their selfish and self-interested goals, often steal state property and endanger the interests of the people through illegal behaviors such as bribery, deception, and tax evasion. What is especially hateful is that they do not hesitate to use all despicable and shameless means to seduce and corrupt our cadres, and drag our staff into the water. Many of our comrades with weak will have become their prisoners and have been harmed by them.

    Workers across the country all understand the truth that labor creates the world. All the material civilization in the world is created by our working people, not by those bourgeoisie who exploit the masses, do not work for a living, and are selfish and self-interested. Our happiness is created by our own labor. And the bourgeoisie, according to its class essence, relies on exploiting the surplus labor of the working class and other methods of harming others to benefit themselves in order to achieve their personal enjoyment. This is a truth that human history has already proven. We must not only understand this truth ourselves, but also openly tell the bourgeoisie that they must also understand this most basic and most realistic truth: You are an exploiting class, you are unearned, you are selfish and self-interested, and everything you eat, wear, live in, and use is created by us laborers! After our liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we are working hard to increase production and practice economy, constantly creating and accumulating a large amount of wealth for the country, for the benefit of the entire people, and in order to transform China from an agricultural country into a rich and strong industrial country, from new democracy to socialism. We are working, accumulating wealth, but you are trying every possible means to steal, waste, and damage the interests of the country and the people. Is this still a world? If you want to develop legally and have a bright future, you must honestly and obediently develop under the leadership of our working class and our Communist Party, in accordance with the direction of the Common Program, abide by national policies and laws, and obey the leadership of the state-owned economy and the state production plan, and you must not engage in those behaviors of harming others to benefit oneself, speculation and opportunism, and stealing state property. Those who have already done so must quickly confess to the government, repent, and guarantee that they will never dare to do this again. The government should deal with capitalists who violate the law according to the size of their crimes and the degree of their confession. Those capitalists who violate laws and regulations and refuse to confess must be severely punished by state law.

    Workers across the country should be vigilant and act: Defend our country, defend our Party, defend the purity and excellent traditions of our class, eliminate bourgeois ideology in our class ranks, and resolutely repulse the wild onslaught of the bourgeoisie! Within our working class and within our trade unions, we must first straighten ourselves out, strengthen ourselves, and eliminate all phenomena of corruption and waste and bureaucratic work styles that are affected by bourgeois ideology. All corrupt elements should quickly wake up and turn back, and quickly confess how you have been corrupted by bourgeois ideology and directly enticed and bought off by the bourgeoisie, which led to corrupt behavior. You have already been deceived, so don't hesitate and be stubborn anymore. As long as you confess voluntarily, serious crimes can be reduced to light crimes, and light crimes can be exempted from punishment; those who refuse to confess will only be subjected to heavier punishment. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we can and will certainly win this serious battle. Those who have been captured should quickly return to their own ranks, and they can also atone for their crimes and fight against bourgeois ideology and behavior together with their comrades.

    We must draw a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie in terms of ideology and behavior, straighten out the ranks of our working class, raise the awareness of our working class, and under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, expose the ugly behaviors of those illegal merchants, eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology, and resolutely repel the wild onslaught of the bourgeoisie.

    坚决打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻
    ——工人日报十八日社论
    本月十四日，中华全国总工会又召开了一次直属机关全体工作人员大会，由刘宁一副主席总结了最近几天全国总工会各单位反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的情况，并进一步明确地指出这个运动的性质和方向。这次会议将不仅动员全国总工会机关工作人员，使全国总工会机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动向更深入、更饱满的阶段发展，而且将进一步发动全国工人群众，向资产阶级的反动的丑恶的思想和行为，展开严重的斗争。
    薄一波同志在他一月九日的报告中向我们明确地指出：“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，本质上就是反对资产阶级腐化堕落思想的斗争，也就是对于资产阶级在三年以来向着工人阶级和中国共产党所举行的猖狂进攻，来一个坚决的反攻，把这种反动的进攻压下去，并把资产阶级的这种反动的丑恶的思想和行为给以政治上的改造和法律上的制裁。只有这样，革命胜利才能有保证。这是一场严重的阶级斗争，我们必须在这场斗争中取得胜利。”在刘宁一副主席的报告中，深刻地揭发了资产阶级三年来向我们工人阶级进攻的许多严重事实。资产阶级为了达到他们自私自利的卑鄙的目的，竟敢限制我们工会的活动，分化我们工人阶级的团结，甚至派出他们的走狗到我们工会中来，收买、利诱、威胁，……害怕工会团结教育工人群众来揭发他们那些卑鄙龌龊的罪行，猖狂地向我们进攻。我们全国工人阶级群众，必须认识反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义斗争的历史意义，认识资产阶级的丑恶面目，在共产党的领导之下，积极地勇敢地、来进行这一场严重的阶级斗争。
    根据已有的材料看来，现在的工会机关和工会干部中，的确存在着不少贪污、浪费和官僚主义的现象。为什么在工人阶级群众及其工会领导机关中，还会有贪污、浪费和官僚主义的现象发生呢？这是不是我们工人阶级和工会机关原来就这样糟糕呢？不是的。这正如薄一波同志在他的报告中所指出的这种现象的产生，“在一方面，是因为在革命胜利之后，大量抱着旧思想、旧作风而又没有来得及改造的旧的反动政府的工作人员加入到人民政府和国营企业中来了。”我们工会机关中也正是有这样一批还未经过思想改造的留用人员，他们本身还是那一套，
    一有机会就进行贪污浪费。“在另一方面，也是更重要的一方面，却是因为在革命胜利之后，在和平环境中，我们党内、政府内、军队内、人民民主统
    一战线内，许多同志，特别是许多领导同志没有充分警惕资产阶级思想对于革命的侵蚀作用。”我们工会机关中的许多同志，正是或多或少地受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀的！
    全国工人同志们都应该懂得：贪污、浪费和官僚主义都不是工人阶级的思想和行为，而是资产阶级的思想和行为。工人阶级是依靠自己的劳动为生的，工人阶级的本质是勤劳朴素的，大公无私的，忠诚的，坚定的，有着光荣的革命历史传统的。我们工人阶级一直是在中国共产党的领导下，成为中国革命的领导阶级。我们的工会，也一直是在中国共产党的领导下，成为党的忠实助手，在全国胜利后更是人民民主政权的重要柱石。我们不但担负着领导中国革命胜利的责任，而且担负着领导全国人民完成新民主主义进一步走向社会主义的重大历史使命。
    资产阶级的本质是什么呢？虽然，“今天的中国民族资产阶级有其积极进步的一面，……他们中间
    一部分代表人物，在一定时期，一定程度上参加过或同情过人民解放斗争，解放后，他们逐渐参加了人民中国的建设，并在国家的领导下，发挥着一定的积极作用；但是中国民族资产阶级还有其黑暗腐朽的一面，那就是由于他们与帝国主义的、封建的、官僚买办的经济有着千丝万缕的联系，同时，中国资产阶级本身也同世界各国的资产阶级一样，具有唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的本质。”（周恩来副主席在人民政协全国委员会常务委员会第三十四次会议上的报告）全国工人职员群众必须懂得资产阶级是一个剥削阶级，必须了解周总理和薄一波同志所指出的阶级的本质。解放后，资产阶级中间的某些人，为了达到他们少数人的自私自利的目的，常常以行贿、欺骗、偷税漏税等犯法行为，盗窃国家财产，危害人民利益。尤其可恶的是：他们不惜使用一切卑鄙无耻的手段，来勾引和腐蚀我们的干部，拖我们的工作人员下水。我们有许多意志不坚定的同志，就变成了他们的俘虏，受到了他们的伤害。
    全国工人同志都懂得劳动创造世界的真理。世界上的一切物质文明都是我们劳动人民创造的，不是那些剥削群众、不劳而食、自私自利的资产阶级所创造的。我们的幸福是靠自己的劳动创造起来的。而资产阶级，按照它的阶级本质说来，则是依靠剥削工人阶级剩余劳动和其他损人利己的方法来达到他们个人享乐的目的的。这是人类历史已经证明了的真理。我们不但自己要懂得这个真理，而且要公开地告诉资产阶级也要懂得这条最起码最现实的真理：你们是剥削阶级，你们是不劳而获的，你们是自私自利的，你们吃的、穿的、住的、用的，没有那一件不是我们劳动者创造出来的！我们解放以后，正在毛主席和共产党的领导下，努力增产节约，为国家不断地创造着和积累着大量的财富，目的是为了
    全体人民的利益，为了使中国由农业国变成富强的
    工业国，由新民主主义走向社会主义。我们在劳动，在积累着财富，你们却想尽千方百计在盗窃、在浪费、在破坏着国家和人民的利益。这还成个世界吗？你们要想合法地发展，要想有光明的出路，就必须老老实实、规规矩矩地在我们工人阶级和我们的共产党的领导之下，按照共同纲领的方向发展，遵守国家政策法令，服从国营经济和国家生产计划的领导，而不准再有那些损人利己、投机取巧、盗窃国家财产的行为。已经作了的，必须赶快向政府坦白、悔过，并且保证以后再不敢干这一套勾当了。政府对于犯法的资本家，要根据他的罪恶大小、坦白程度来处理，对于那些违法乱纪又拒不坦白的资本家，就必须用国法来严厉制裁他们。
    全国工人同志们应当警惕起来，行动起来：保卫我们的国家、保卫我们的党、保卫我们的阶级的纯洁和优良的传统，在我们的阶级队伍中肃清资产阶级的思想，坚决打退资产阶级的进攻！在我们工人阶级内部、在我们工会内部，首先要整齐起来，坚强起来，肃清一切受到资产阶级思想影响的贪污、浪费现象和官僚主义作风。一切贪污分子赶快觉悟回头吧，赶快坦白你们是怎样受了资产阶级思想的腐蚀和资产阶级的直接引诱、收买，因而产生了贪污行为。你们已经上了当了，就不要再瞻前顾后，执迷不悟了。只要是自动坦白的，重罪的可以减为轻罪，轻罪的可以免罪；拒不坦白的就只有遭到加重治罪的处罚。我们在共产党和毛主席的领导下，就能够而且一定使这场严重的战斗获得胜利。当了俘虏的赶快回到自己的队伍中来，还可以将功赎罪，和同志们一道与资产阶级的思想行为作战。
    我们必须从思想上到行为上划清工人阶级和资产阶级的界限，整齐我们工人阶级的队伍，提高我们工人阶级的觉悟，在毛主席和共产党的英明领导之下，揭露那些不法商人的丑恶行为，肃清资产阶级思想的影响，坚决打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻。
