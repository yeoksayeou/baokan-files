    Henan Lingbao County Jianhua Packing Plant
    Loss of Over 9,000 Jin of Cotton Due to Bureaucratic Leadership Cadres
    Editor: The leadership cadres of the Jianhua Packing Plant in Lingbao County, Henan, have serious bureaucracy, resulting in the loss of 9,710 jin of cotton. Originally, the plant's fire-fighting equipment was very complete, with a 60-ton water tower, water pipe connections in front of the workshop, as well as canvas belts, fire extinguishers, fire trucks, and fire rakes. In terms of security organization, the plant had a security section, a safety committee, a fire brigade, guards, and worker-organized safety groups. However, the leadership cadres of this plant had never inspected the fire protection work. On December 19th last year, when workers in the No. 4 cotton picking room were ginning cotton, a fire suddenly broke out. One worker hastily used a bundle of straw to beat the fire, which instead helped spread the fire. At that time, the plant's manager, Guo, and the person in charge of the cotton picking room had gone out, but the security section chief hid in his room and did not come out. When some people went to put out the fire, they were blocked by the guards, who even tore off their badges. Some workers were unable to release water because the main switch of the water pipe was closed, so they went to the machine room to open the main switch, but the door had been locked. By the time the person with the key was found, no one knew how to open the water gate. Due to repeated delays in rescue time, the fire became uncontrollable. The fire-fighting equipment that had cost a lot of money to purchase could not play any role at the time of the accident. In this way, the state lost 9,710 jin of cotton. I think the leadership cadres of this plant should make a deep self-criticism of this bureaucratic style. Hu Binghong

    河南灵宝县建华打包厂
    领导干部官僚主义造成损失棉花九千多斤的事件
    编辑同志：河南灵宝县建华打包厂领导干部有严重的官僚主义，造成九千七百一十斤棉花的损失。本来，这个厂的消防设备很完善，有六十吨容量的水塔一座，工房门前有水管接口，还有帆布带、灭火机、消防车以及火耙子等。在保安组织方面，厂里除了有保卫股、安全委员会、消防队、警卫员，还有工人组织的安全小组。但是，这个厂的领导干部对消防工作从来没有检查过。去年十二月十九日，四号拣花房工人正在打花时，突然发现起火。有一个工人急忙用一束稻草打火，反助长了火势蔓延。当时，这个厂的郭经理和拣花房的负责人都已外出，保卫股长却躲在房内不出来。有人前往救火，竟为警卫员阻拦，并撕去他的徽章。有些工人因水管的总开关被关闭，放不出水来，就到机器房开总开关，但房门已被上了锁。等到找到开锁的人，大家又不会开水门。由于一再拖延抢救时间，火势遂致不可收拾。花了许多钱添置的消防设备，在出事时却不能起一点作用。就这样，使国家损失了九千七百一十斤棉花。我觉得这个厂的领导干部对这种官僚主义作风应作深刻检讨。　胡秉洪
