Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 6th: During the subcommittee meeting on the third item of the agenda of the Korean armistice talks on the 6th, the other side continued to threaten to disrupt the armistice talks, attempting to force our side to accept their unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs and restrict equipment within Korea. The other side openly stated: "Unless you accept our plan, we are prepared to let cannons, bombs, and bullets continue the debate." Our representative sternly pointed out: "You have been attempting to close the door to negotiations for days, using war to threaten our side, and attempting to force our side to accept your unreasonable demands. However, your so-called military pressure cannot intimidate anyone. We have resolutely opposed any unreasonable demands that interfere in our internal affairs, and we will always resolutely oppose them. Based on our consistent sincerity for a Korean armistice and our position of thoroughly peacefully resolving the Korean issue, our side has repeatedly proposed plans that fully guarantee a stable and effective armistice. However, you arrogantly boast of military pressure. Since the negotiations began, you have never abandoned military pressure and have tried to use your so-called military pressure several times. You should have gained sufficient experience and lessons from these attempts."
    During the subcommittee meeting on the fourth item of the agenda, the other side delivered a lengthy explanation of its absurd proposal of January 2nd. Our representative pointed out: The other side's lengthy speech not only failed to explain the contradictions in the other side's proposal, but also further affirmed our side's repeated comments on the other side's proposal. The essence of the other side's proposal is to demand that our side release and repatriate all enemy prisoners of war in a barbaric one-for-one exchange, while detaining the vast majority of our prisoners of war as hostages, and attempting to hand over our prisoners of war to the Li Chiang bandit gang under the despicable pretext of so-called "non-repatriation." Our representative solemnly declared again that our side resolutely rejects the other side's absurd and outrageous plan. In order to resolve the fourth item of the agenda, both sides should immediately adopt the principle of rapidly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the signing of the armistice agreement.

    我方严斥美方用战争相威胁的狂妄企图
    再次郑重声明断然拒绝美方关于俘虏问题的荒谬方案
    【新华社开城六日电】在六日的朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方继续以破坏停战谈判为威胁，妄图强迫我方接受其干涉我方内政，限制朝鲜境内设备的无理要求。对方公然声称：“除非你们接受我们的方案，否则我们准备让大炮、炸弹和子弹去继续辩论。”我方代表严词指出：“你方连日来企图关闭谈判之门，用战争来威胁我方，企图强迫我方接受你方的无理要求。但是，你方的所谓军事压力是吓不倒人的。任何属于干涉我方内政的无理要求我们已经坚决地反对，我们并将永远坚决地反对。根据我方一贯对朝鲜停战的诚意和我方彻底和平解决朝鲜问题的立场，我方已经历次提出了充分保证稳定和有效的停战的方案。但你方却狂妄地吹嘘军事压力，自从谈判以来，你方从未放弃军事压力，并且几次尝试使用你方所谓军事压力。你方在这种尝试中应该已经获得了充分的经验和教训。”
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方对其一月二日的荒谬提案发表长篇的解释。我方代表指出：对方的长篇发言不但不能解释对方提案的自相矛盾，而且更加肯定了我方一再提出的对于对方提案的评论。对方提案的实质就是在一对一交换的野蛮方式下，要求我方释放与遣还全部对方被俘人员，但却扣留我方绝大部分的被俘人员作为人质，并在所谓
    “不愿遣返”的卑鄙藉口下，企图将我方的被俘人员送交李蒋匪帮。我方代表再次郑重声明我方断然拒绝对方的荒谬绝伦的方案。为了解决第四项议程，双方应该立即通过停战协议签字后迅速释放与遣返全体战俘的原则。
