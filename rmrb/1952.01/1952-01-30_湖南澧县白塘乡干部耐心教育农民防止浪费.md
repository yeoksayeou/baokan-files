    Cadres in Baitang Township, Lixian County, Hunan Province, patiently educate farmers to prevent waste
    In mid-January of this year, Xi Shipu, a farmer in Baitang Township, Fifth District, Lixian County, Hunan Province, lost his wife. The villagers all said that she was a good person and deserved to have a Daoist ceremony performed for her. So Xi Shipu hired a Daoist priest and prepared to hold the ceremony. Li Daojun, the village farmers' association chairman, and Hu Huajing, a district cadre, heard the news and went to Xi's house to patiently persuade Xi Shipu, explaining that superstitious waste was not only useless to the deceased but also hindered production. Xi Shipu's eldest son, who was a cadre in the district government, also wrote to persuade his father to save the money for the Daoist ceremony and use it for production. Xi Shipu's thinking was finally straightened out, and he sent the Daoist priest away. Xi Shipu saved the seven *shi* of grain he had prepared for the ceremony and invested it in production. I believe that rural cadres in all regions should educate farmers in this way.

    湖南澧县白塘乡干部耐心教育农民防止浪费
    今年一月中旬，湖南澧县五区白塘乡农民习世普死了老婆。村里人都说她的为人好，应该做道场。习世普就请了道士，准备做道场。村农会主席李道峻和区干部胡化景听到这个消息，就跑到习家，耐心劝说习世普，说明迷信浪费不但对死人无益，而且妨害生产。习世普在区政府当干部的大儿子，也写信劝他父亲，把做道场的钱，节省下来搞生产。习世普的思想终于搞通了，把道士送出了门。习世普把准备作道场的七石谷子节省了，投进了生产。我认为各地农村干部，都应该这样教育农民。
