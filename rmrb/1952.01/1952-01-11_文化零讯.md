    ▲ More than 200 theatrical workers from the Southwest District held a theatrical work conference from December 5th to 10th last year. The conference decided to focus on local operas popular with the people of Southwest China, such as Sichuan Opera, Yunnan Opera, and Flower Lantern Opera, as the key areas for theatrical reform. It also aimed to review and adapt more than 70 Sichuan Opera scripts and more than 30 Yunnan Opera and Flower Lantern Opera scripts in 1952. It called on artists and people's cultural workers to cooperate and vigorously create new opera scripts. It will continue to run training classes for artists and carry out the ideological remoulding movement of theatrical workers in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    ▲ The sixth passenger crew of the Liuzhou Train Section of the Liuzhou Railway Sub-bureau projects slides on the train to carry out propaganda to passengers, which has achieved good results. Since the group began projecting slides on August 19th last year, it has attracted more than 50,000 viewers by the end of November. The method of projecting slides on trains has been adopted on some trains of the Hengyang Railway Administration.
    ▲ Since its inception on January 16th last year, the Tibetan-language newspaper in Qinghai Province has been loved by the vast Tibetan people and Mongolian people who know the Tibetan language. Tibetan and Mongolian people in various places have requested subscriptions. In order to further meet the requirements of the Tibetan and Mongolian people, the newspaper has been changed from a quarto-sized two-page publication to a quarto-sized four-page publication since May last year, and from a ten-day publication to a weekly publication since December. At present, the newspaper's circulation per issue has increased from 1,000 copies at the time of its launch to 2,000 copies.
