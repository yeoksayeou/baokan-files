    The CCP Volunteer Army Committee Calls on the Entire Army to Practice Thrift and Oppose Wasteful Practices
    [Reported by this newspaper] To respond to Chairman Mao's call, the Chinese Communist Party's Chinese People's Volunteer Army Committee issued instructions on December 14th of last year, requiring the entire army to launch a movement against corruption, waste, and for practicing thrift. The instructions first pointed out: The Volunteer Army is in a war environment, and the most important problems are waste and losses of non-combat materials. Some comrades mistakenly believe: "The motherland is vast and rich in resources, and has everything we need, so wasting a little doesn't matter." Therefore, there are phenomena of discarding, abusing, and not cherishing materials. For example, some units have suffered losses of vehicles and materials due to a lack of responsibility. Also, in daily life, there are extravagant and wasteful phenomena due to lax systems. In addition to criticizing these phenomena, the instructions pointed out that opposing waste is an important part of the Volunteer Army's campaign against corruption, waste, and for practicing thrift, requiring Party committees at all levels to mobilize Party members, Youth League members, commanders, and combatants throughout the army to conduct strict reviews and self-examinations, thoroughly expose wasteful phenomena, strictly investigate corruption cases, and formulate specific plans based on the different conditions of each unit.
    Regarding practicing thrift, the instructions pointed out that, under the principle of taking care of the soldiers' lives, careful calculations should be made to save on possible expenses. In this way, not only can the country's financial and material resources be saved and used for the construction of modern national defense and industry, but also the difficulties of transportation and supply can be reduced. The CCP Volunteer Army Committee's instructions also put forward some specific thrift measures. In terms of clothing, it was proposed that each person save a set of shirts and a pair of shoes. Rear personnel, based on their individual circumstances and on a voluntary basis, should strive to save an extra set of clothes and a pair of shoes. It was suggested that everyone cherish their overcoats and strive to wear them for another winter. In terms of funds, it was proposed to save on heating expenses (the fuel for the troops' heating is mostly obtained through the soldiers' labor), with companies saving two-thirds, and agencies and the rear saving half. Other expenses should also be saved as much as possible, and it was suggested that each unit donate half to two-thirds of their own savings and accumulations, along with the savings from funds, to purchase airplanes. In terms of grain, supply should be guaranteed, and there should be no loss or waste. Personnel in the second line and the rear should strive to save five qian to one liang of grain per person per day to help Korean refugees. Grain bags, gasoline barrels, etc. should all be properly stored and handed over.
    The Party committee's instructions especially called on Party committees at all levels in the Volunteer Army to carry out criticism and self-criticism in the movement against corruption, waste, and for practicing thrift, to examine their own leadership, criticize various erroneous viewpoints, and correct the indifferent or even tolerant attitude of some cadres towards corruption and waste. Cadres should lead by example at all levels, strictly abide by the system, promote a hard-working and simple style, and go deep into the lower levels to closely contact and mobilize the masses.

    中共志愿军党委号召全军
    厉行节约反对浪费现象
    【本报讯】为了响应毛主席的号召，中国共产党中国人民志愿军党委，已在去年十二月十四日发出指示，要求全军开展反贪污、反浪费、厉行节约运动。指示首先指出：志愿军处在战争环境中，最主要的问题是浪费和非战斗物资的损失。有些同志错误地认为：“祖国地大物博，要什么有什么，浪费一点不算什么。”因此，有乱丢、滥用、不爱惜物资的现象。例如有些单位由于责任心不强，使车辆物资曾遭受损失。又如在日常生活中，由于制度松懈，也有铺张浪费的现象。指示除了对于这些现象提出批评外，并指出反对浪费是志愿军开展反贪污、反浪费、厉行节约运动的重要环节，要求各级党委动员全军中的党员、青年团员、指挥员和战斗员进行严格的检讨反省，彻底揭发浪费现象，严格追查贪污案件，并根据各部队的不同情况，订出具体计划。
    关于厉行节约，指示中指出，应在照顾战士生活的原则下，精打细算，节约一些可能的开支。这样，不仅可以节约祖国的财力、物力，使它们用在建设现代化国防与工业方面，而且可以减轻运输供应的困难。中共志愿军党委的指示中同时提出了一些具体的节约办法。在被服方面，提议每人节约一套衬衣、一双鞋子，后方人员根据个人情况，在自愿的原则下争取多节约一套衣服、一双鞋子，建议大家爱惜大衣，争取再穿一冬。在经费方面，提议节约烤火费（部队烤火的燃料多由战士劳动得来），连队节约三分之二，机关和后方节约一半，其他开支也应尽量做到节约，并建议各单位把自己的家务和积存捐献出一半到三分之二，连同经费的节约，用来购买飞机。在粮食方面，应保证供应，并且不损失、不浪费。第二线和后方的人员每人每天应争取节约五钱到一两粮食，救济朝鲜难民。对粮袋、汽油桶等都应设法妥为保存并上交。
    党委的指示特别号召，在反贪污、反浪费、厉行节约运动中，志愿军中各级党委应该开展批评与自我批评，检查自己的领导，批判各种错误观点，纠正有些干部对贪污浪费现象的麻痹大意甚至姑息的态度。干部应该以身作则，层层带头，严格遵守制度，发扬艰苦朴素作风，并深入下层密切联系和发动群众。
