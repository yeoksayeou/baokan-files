    The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is the central political task at present. People's Supervision Committees at all levels of the People's Government must participate with all their strength and cooperate with various departments to vigorously lead this struggle. All supervision personnel must participate in practical work to conduct supervision and inspection. People's Supervision organs at all levels should set up People's Complaint Reception Rooms to receive the people's complaints and, through supervision correspondents and "People's Opinion Boxes," mobilize the broad masses of the people to report corrupt elements, expose phenomena of waste and bureaucracy, and accuse those unscrupulous merchants who collude with public officials through bribery, fraud, exorbitant profits, tax evasion, and other behaviors to steal state property.

    Supervision Committees at all levels should assist government organs and enterprise departments at all levels to highly promote democracy, launch criticism and self-criticism, with leading cadres taking personal responsibility and conducting inspections from top to bottom. In the early stages of the movement, we must pay close attention to correcting those organs and personnel who superficially comply but secretly resist and suppress democracy. When the masses have been mobilized, we must assist in conducting in-depth inspections, clarify right and wrong, and promptly handle cases accordingly.

    Supervision Committees at all levels should use this struggle to improve the supervisory institutions and absorb activists from various organs and departments as supervision correspondents to extensively establish a supervisory communication network.

    Supervision Committees above the provincial (municipal) level should report the dynamics of their work to this Committee at any time.

    (This instruction will not be issued separately.)

    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会
    关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的指示
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，是当前中心的政治任务。各级人民政府人民监察委员会必须以全力参加并配合各部门大力领导这一斗争。所有监察工作人员都要参加到实际工作中进行监督与检查，各级人民监察机关应设置人民检举接待室，接待检举的人民，并通过监察通讯员和“人民意见箱”，使广大人民群众都起来检举贪污分子、揭发浪费和官僚主义的现象及控告那些以行贿、欺诈、暴利、偷漏等行为勾结公务人员盗窃国家财产的奸商。
    各级监委应协助各级政府机关、企业部门高度地发扬民主，展开批评和自我批评，首长亲自负责，自上而下进行检查。在运动刚刚开始的时期，应切实注意纠举那些阳奉阴违压制民主的机关和人员。当群众已经发动起来，就要协助进行深入检查，弄清是非，并及时分别加以处理。
    各级监委应通过这一斗争，把监察机构健全起来，并在斗争中吸取各机关部门的积极分子为监察通讯员，广泛地建立监察通讯网。
    省（市）以上监委应将工作中的动态，随时报告本委。
    （此指示不另行文）
