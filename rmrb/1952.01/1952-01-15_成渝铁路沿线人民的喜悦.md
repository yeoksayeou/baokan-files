The farmers along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway all say that they encountered three happy events last year. These three happy events are: land reform, bumper agricultural harvests, and the train reaching Neijiang.

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, from Chongqing to Neijiang, is 284 kilometers long and passes through rich counties in the Sichuan Basin. This area is rich in grain, sugarcane sugar, cotton, and various other famous local products. Now, the trains are full of large quantities of materials. The towns along the railway are prospering. For example, last year Neijiang's sugarcane sugar production increased by 36% compared to the previous year; Longchang's ramie cloth production increased by 120% compared to the previous year. Many coal mines that had been shut down have now resumed operation. The Yida Coal Mine in Longchang almost dismissed all its workers the year before last due to the stockpiling of coal; now, coal is transported cheaply by train, and production is thriving. Many new factories have also been established along the railway. For example, Longchang has already established a factory producing carbon black; the Neijiang Special District has also made plans to establish local industries, and thousands of workers are working hard to open the foundations and build houses for the new factories.

Yongchuan is the first small city on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to have train service. This small city has become particularly prosperous due to convenient transportation and last year's bumper harvest. It has become a gathering place for grain from the grain-producing areas of Tongliang and Dazu. Long pack trains transport grain and coal to the station for railway transport. The freight rate for transporting 100 tons of goods to Chongqing by rail is only about 60,000 yuan, which is more than three-quarters lower than the cost of manual transport in the past. The regional price difference between industrial products from Yongchuan and industrial products from Chongqing is also one-third lower than before. Last year, farmers in Yongchuan received much more cotton cloth and general merchandise than before. The county has also increased many new industries. Compared to June before the railway opened, in October of last year the number of brick and tile businesses increased from five to eighteen, the number of oil presses increased from twenty-three to thirty-one, and the handmade paper industry also increased by fifty.

Recently, a new urban area has been designated near the railway station. Citizens have purchased land here and are preparing to build houses.

The market in Yongchuan City is also much more lively than before. For the convenience of pedestrians coming and going to the market, the residents of the city recently thoroughly renovated the streets. The farmers say it well: "In the past, road repairs only benefited bandits and soldiers, but now wherever transportation is convenient, it prospers." The highway from Yongchuan to Luxian is also being planned, and the farmers have decided to contract the construction themselves. Some towns along the railway have also widened small roads into avenues. Now there are five or six avenues connecting Yongchuan City with the railway.

The farmers express infinite concern for the completed railway. Along the road, there is a track maintenance outpost every one or two kilometers. The farmer track maintenance team members, wearing red armbands, protect the safety of the railway day and night. Landlords and local bullies have tried to sabotage the railway several times, but they have all been discovered by the farmers in advance. The farmers in charge of each section of track remember the number of spikes and sleepers they are responsible for. Farmers maintaining the track near Yongchuan have also made white marks on the spikes for easy inspection at night.

The farmers talked about the railway that they had been calling for for forty years in the old society but had not been built. They were all overjoyed that it had been built in just over a year after liberation. On the many silk banners they sent to the railway builders, they wrote: "Chairman Mao has come, and the train has also come!" "The People's Government has built our road to happiness!"

    成渝铁路沿线人民的喜悦
    新华社记者　李楠　许上遴
    成渝铁路沿线的农民都说，他们去年遇到了三重喜事。这三重喜事就是：土地改革、农产丰收和火车通到了内江。
    成渝铁路由重庆到内江，共长二百八十四公里，所经过的地方，都是四川盆地富饶的县份。这一带地区，盛产粮食、甘蔗糖、棉花和其他各种著名的土特产。现在，来往的火车都满载着大批物资。铁路沿线的城镇正在繁荣起来。举例来说，去年内江的甘蔗糖产量，就比前年增加了百分之三十六；隆昌的夏布产量，比前年增加了百分之一百二十。曾停顿了的许多煤矿，都已经开工了。前年，隆昌义大煤矿因存煤堆积如山，几乎遣散了全部工人；现在煤炭由火车廉价运输，生产蒸蒸日上。铁路沿线并已开办了不少新的工厂，如隆昌已经开办了生产炭黑的工厂；内江专区也做出了兴办地方工业的计划，上千的工人正在为新厂开辟地基和建筑房屋而紧张地工作着。
    永川是成渝铁路最先通车的一座小城，这座小城已因交通便利和去年丰收显得特别繁荣。这里已成了铜梁、大足一带粮产区粮食的集中地，漫长的驮马队把粮食和煤运到车站去，再经过铁路外运。每百吨货物由铁路运到重庆的运价只需六万元左右，比过去用人力运输减低四分之三以上。永川工业品和重庆工业品的地区差价也比以前减低三分之一。去年永川的农民得到的棉布和百货比以前多得多了。这个县也已增加了许多新的工业，以去年十月份和通车前六月份相比，砖瓦业由五户增加到十八户，油房由二十三户增加到三十一户，手工造纸业也增加了五十户。
    在火车站附近，最近已划成了新市区。市民们在这里购买了地基，准备兴修房屋。
    永川城的市集也比从前热闹多了。城里的居民为了赶集时来往行人的便利，最近把街道都彻底翻修了一次。农民们说得好：“过去修道路只便利了土匪和官兵，现在那里交通便利，那里就繁荣。”永川到泸县的公路也已经在筹划了，农民们并决定自己来包修它。沿着铁路的乡镇，有的也已把小路开拓成大道，现在永川城附近和铁路联系起来的大道已有五、六条了。
    农民们对已修成的铁路表示无限关心，沿路每隔
    一、二公里就有一个护路哨棚，带着红臂章的农民护路队员们，日夜保卫着铁路的安全。地主、恶霸有好几次想破坏铁路，都被农民们事先发现了。各段护路的农民，都记得清自己所管道钉和枕木的数目。永川附近护路的农民，还在道钉上做上了白色的标志，以便晚上查看。
    农民们谈起在旧社会喊叫了四十年没有修成的铁路，解放后只修筑一年多就有了这样大的成就，个个都兴高采烈。他们在送给筑路工人的许多锦旗上写着：“毛主席来了，火车也来了！”“人民政府把我们的幸福的道路修通了！”
