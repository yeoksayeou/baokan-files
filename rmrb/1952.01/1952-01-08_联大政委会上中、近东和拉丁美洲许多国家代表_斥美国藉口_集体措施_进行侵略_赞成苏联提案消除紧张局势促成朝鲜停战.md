Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 7th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the 4th to continue discussing the report of the so-called "Collective Measures Committee."

    Czechoslovakian delegation head Sekaninova spoke, fiercely attacking the U.S.'s so-called "collective measures" system. She pointed out that this system violates the fundamental principles and aims of the UN Charter, and its purpose is to legitimize the aggressive plans and actions of the U.S. and the NATO bloc led by the U.S. Therefore, the Czechoslovakian delegation disagrees with the report of the "Collective Measures Committee" and the proposal submitted by the eleven nations including the U.S., Britain, and France to adopt this report. The Czechoslovakian delegation welcomes and will vote in favor of the Soviet proposal, which recommends abolishing the "Collective Measures Committee" and suggests that the Security Council immediately convene regular meetings to consider measures sufficient to eliminate the tensions currently existing in international relations and establish friendly relations between countries, first examining the measures the Security Council should take to help the Korean armistice negotiations achieve a successful conclusion.

    Representatives from France, Brazil, the Netherlands, and the Philippines supported the "Collective Measures Committee" report and the eleven-nation proposal. These representatives attempted to justify their demands to deprive the Security Council of its power and transfer this power to the General Assembly, therefore stubbornly claiming that the Security Council had been paralyzed because of its adherence to the principle of great power unanimity. Although, in fact, the reason the Security Council has been unable to take action on many events is only because the U.S. has consistently attempted to use arbitrary methods to force the Security Council to adopt proposals that support the aggressive plans of the U.S. and the NATO countries.

    At the same time, the discussions at the 4th meeting proved that many countries are unwilling to participate in the U.S.'s so-called "collective measures" system; the true task of this system is to force other countries to use their resources and armed forces to realize the aggressive plans of U.S. monopoly capitalists. This opposition, although not thorough and firm enough, can be seen from the many amendments proposed to the eleven-nation proposal, and can be seen from the fact that some countries support several important points in the Soviet proposal.

    For example, the Colombian, Mexican, and Chilean delegations suggested removing the paragraph adopting the so-called "Collective Measures Committee" report from the eleven-nation proposal and suggesting only that the report be placed on record. The amendments proposed by the three countries are also intended to prevent the U.S. from arbitrarily using the resources and armed forces of other countries to realize its military plans under the flag of the United Nations. The Mexican representative said in explaining this amendment that Mexico, Colombia, and Chile cannot fully agree with the conclusions in the so-called "Collective Measures Committee" report. UN member states should have the right to independently decide the extent to which they contribute to these measures. He also said that it is unacceptable to force UN member states to make their laws and constitutions comply with the report's requirement to participate in "collective measures" as much as possible. The Peruvian representative also said that it is impossible to demand "contributions" from UN member states regardless of the laws and constitutions of one country or another. The suggestion to hand over the command and leadership of collective measures of UN member states to any one country should be given more consideration. The Peruvian representative stated that he could not accept the inference and conclusions of the eleven-nation proposal that suggested adopting the "Collective Measures Committee" report.

    The delegations of Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria also proposed amendments to the eleven-nation proposal out of the same desire to avoid being forced to participate in the U.S. system of so-called "collective measures." This amendment said that nothing in the eleven-nation proposal can be interpreted as allowing any measures to be taken within any country without the free and affirmative consent of that country.

    This group of countries, except for Afghanistan, supported the point in the Soviet proposal that stipulates that the Security Council should immediately convene regular meetings to consider measures sufficient to eliminate the tensions currently existing in international relations and establish friendly relations between countries. These countries also agreed with another point in the Soviet proposal, which stipulates that at regular meetings, the Security Council must first examine the measures it should take to facilitate the successful conclusion of the Korean armistice negotiations.

    Syrian representative El-Gouri spoke, explaining the attitude of the Middle Eastern countries on this issue. He said that the "United Action for Peace" resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly and the report of the "Collective Measures Committee" are irreconcilable with the United Nations Charter, because this resolution and report both stipulate that the power to maintain peace and security be granted to the United Nations General Assembly, while the Charter stipulates that these powers can only be granted to the Security Council. El-Gouri said that he agreed with the speeches of the Soviet and Czechoslovakian representatives that, according to the Charter, only the Security Council has the right to pass resolutions to stop and oppose aggression when aggression occurs.

    El-Gouri also said: However, there have been times when facts have proven that the Security Council has not been able to take the necessary decisions. Some people believe that the only way to solve this problem is to violate the Charter and abolish the principle of unanimity among the great powers in the Security Council. He said that it is unacceptable to take this path, because it would mean abolishing the United Nations. To enable the United Nations to fulfill its responsibilities, the correct way should be to restore harmony among the great powers. If this harmony can be restored, if the major powers can act unanimously in accordance with the requirements of the Charter, then the world will never again be threatened by war. Therefore, Syria and other Arab countries support the Soviet proposal's suggestions in this regard, namely, restoring harmony among the major powers, so that the Security Council can fulfill its tasks.

    El-Gouri then talked about the eleven-nation proposal. He said that there are many places in this proposal that stipulate that the United Nations can use the resources and armed forces of its member states without obtaining their consent; the Arab countries and Chile, Colombia, and Mexico believe that these provisions should be removed from the proposal. He said that these suggestions remind us of how Western countries attempted to establish the so-called Middle East Command without obtaining the consent of the Middle Eastern countries, without consulting them, and even without notifying them. The Arab countries can never agree to such suggestions. Independent countries cannot accept this arbitrary approach.

    The Syrian representative said to the representatives of those Latin American countries who support the U.S.'s so-called "collective measures" system: What would you do and what would be your reaction if a certain country suddenly said to you, "We have decided to defend you" without consulting you, without obtaining your consent, and even without notifying you in advance? This is exactly the approach that Western countries used when they proposed that we participate in their plan to establish the so-called Middle East Command.

    Egyptian representative Aidin said: The Arab countries cannot allow others to speak to them so arbitrarily, as Western countries intended to do when they planned to establish the Middle East Command. He also said that the United Nations' collective measures should be to ensure peace. However, can aggressive acts like those of Britain, which, with the support of some other countries, illegally stationed troops in the Nile River Basin against the will of the local residents, regarded the entire Middle East region as its base, regarded it as an area for implementing its military strategic plans, and regarded it as an object of exploitation, be compatible with the principles of the United Nations?

    The Lebanese representative also supported the above-mentioned position of the Arab countries.

    联大政委会上中、近东和拉丁美洲许多国家代表
    斥美国藉口“集体措施”进行侵略
    赞成苏联提案消除紧张局势促成朝鲜停战
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会政治委员会四日举行会议，继续讨论所谓“集体措施委员会”的报告。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长塞卡尼诺娃发言猛烈抨击美国的所谓“集体措施”制度。她指出：这个制度是违反联合国宪章的基本原则和宗旨的，它的目的，是要使美国和以美国为首的北大西洋侵略集团的侵略计划和行动合法化。因此，捷克斯洛伐克代表团不同意“集体措施委员会”的报告以及美、英、法等十一国所提出的通过这个报告的提案。捷克斯洛伐克代表团欢迎并将投票赞成苏联的提案，这提案建议取消“集体措施委员会”，并建议安全理事会立刻召开定期会议，考虑足以消除目前存在于国际关系中的紧张局势并建立各国之间友好关系的措施的问题，首先审查安全理事会为帮助朝鲜停战谈判获得顺利结束而应当采取的措施。
    法国、巴西、荷兰和菲律宾的代表支持“集体措施委员会”的报告和十一国提案。这些代表企图为他们想剥夺安全理事会的权力并且将这种权力移交给大会的要求辩护，因此硬说安全理事会已经因为遵守大国一致原则而瘫痪。虽然，事实上安全理事会之所以在许多事件上不能采取行动，只是由于美国一贯企图用专横的办法，强要安全理事会通过支持美国和北大西洋集团国家的侵略计划的提案。
    同时，四日会议上的讨论证明了有很多国家不愿意参加美国的所谓“集体措施”制度；这个制度的真正任务，是强迫其他国家把它们的资源与武装部队用来实现美国垄断资本家的侵略计划。这种反对，虽然不够彻底和坚定，但是可以从对十一国提案提出的许多修正案中看出来，并且可以由一些国家赞成苏联提案中的若干重要之点一事看出来。
    例如，哥伦比亚、墨西哥和智利代表团建议把通过所谓“集体措施委员会”的报告这一段从十一国提案中取消，并建议只把这个报告载入记录。三国提出的修正案也是打算防止美国随意利用其他国家的资源和武装部队在联合国的旗帜下实现它的军事计划。墨西哥代表在解释这修正案时说：墨西哥、哥伦比亚和智利不能全部同意所谓“集体措施委员会”报告中的结论。联合国会员国应该有权自行决定它们对于这些措施提出贡献的程度。他又说，强迫联合国会员国使它们的法律和宪法符合于报告中所规定的尽可能参加“集体措施”一点，也是不能容许的。秘鲁代表也说：不顾这一国家或另一国家的法律和宪法而要求联合国会员国提出“贡献”，那是不可能的。要把联合国会员国集体措施的指挥与领导权交给任何某一个国家的建议，应该多加考虑。秘鲁代表表示不能接受十一国提案中建议通过“集体措施委员会”报告的推论和结论这一点。
    阿富汗、埃及、伊拉克、伊朗、也门、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚各国代表团对十一国提案提出修正案，也是出于同一种愿望，即避免被迫参加实行所谓“集体措施”这个美国制度。这个修正案说，在十一国提案中，没有一点能够解释为：如果没有得到任何国家自由地和肯定地表示的同意，即不得在这个国家内采取任何措施。
    这一批国家，除阿富汗外，都拥护苏联提案中规定安全理事会立即召开定期会议以考虑足以消除目前国际关系中的紧张局势并建立各国间友好关系的措施这一点。这些国家也同意苏联建议中的另一点，这一点规定在定期会议上必须首先审查安全理事会为促成朝鲜停战谈判获得顺利结束而应当采取的措施。
    叙利亚代表埃尔—古里发言，解释近东国家对这个问题的态度。他说：联合国大会通过的“保障和平的联合行动”决议案以及“集体措施委员会”的报告，是不可能和联合国宪章调和的，因为这项决议和报告都规定把维持和平与安全的权力授予联合国大会，而宪章规定这些权力只能授予安全理事会。埃尔—古里说，他同意苏联和捷克斯洛伐克代表的发言，按照宪章，唯有安全理事会有权在侵略发生时通过制止侵略和反对侵略的决议。
    埃尔—古里又说：但是，有些时候，事实证明安全理事会没有能够采取必要的决定。有些人便认为，要想解决这个难题，唯有破坏宪章，废除安全理事会大国一致的原则。他说，走这条路是不能容许的，因为这就意味着取消联合国。要使联合国能够履行它的职责，正确的方法应该是恢复大国间的和谐。如果这种和谐能够恢复，如果各大国能够按照宪章的要求一致行动，那么，世界就永远不会再受到战争的威胁了。因此，叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家支持苏联提案中关于这一方面的建议，即恢复各大国间的和谐，从而使安全理事会能够履行它的任务。
    埃尔—古里接着谈到十一国提案。他说，这个提案里有许多地方规定联合国无须取得各会员国的同意就使用它们的资源和武装部队；阿拉伯国家和智利、哥伦比亚与墨西哥认为，应该把这些规定从提案中取消。他说，这些建议使我们记起了西方国家如何没有取得近东国家的同意，也没有和它们商量，就企图设立所谓近东司令部。阿拉伯国家是决不能同意这样一类建议的。独立国家不能接受这种专横的手段。
    叙利亚代表向支持美国所谓“集体措施”制度的那些拉丁美洲国家代表团说：假如某个国家没有跟你们商量，没有取得你们的同意，甚至没有事先通知你们，而忽然对你们说：“我们已经决定保卫你们了”，那么你们会怎么办，你们会产生什么反应呢？西方国家提出要我们参加它们建立所谓近东司令部的计划的建议时，用的正是这种办法。
    埃及代表艾丁说：阿拉伯国家不能允许别人那样专横地向它们说话，像西方国家打算建立近东司令部时所表现的那样。他并且说，联合国的集体措施应该是为了保障和平。但是，像英国那样的侵略行为，像它那样在某些其他国家的支持下，不顾当地居民的意志，非法地驻军在尼罗河流域，把整个近东地区视为它的基地，视为实现其军事战略计划的地区，并把它视为剥削的对象，这难道是能够和联合国的原则相容的吗？
    黎巴嫩代表也支持上述阿拉伯国家的态度。
