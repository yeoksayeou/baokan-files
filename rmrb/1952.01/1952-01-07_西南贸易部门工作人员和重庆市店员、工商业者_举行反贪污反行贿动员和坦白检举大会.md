(Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 6th) More than 10,000 staff members from various specialized companies under the Trade Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, shop assistants from various industries in Chongqing, and representatives from various industries in the industrial and commercial sectors jointly held an anti-corruption and anti-bribery mobilization and confession-exposing meeting on the 3rd. The meeting was also broadcast live to allow industrial and commercial households and ordinary residents throughout the city to listen. At the meeting, Liu Zhuofu, Deputy Minister of the Trade Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, and Pan Daizhong, Deputy Director of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees Union, spoke successively, calling on trade workers and shop assistants throughout the city to take the attitude of masters of the country to wage a merciless struggle against corrupt and bribery elements who steal state property. Hu Ziang, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said in his speech: The corrupt behavior of a few staff members is mostly related to bribery by illegal merchants. Therefore, anti-corruption and anti-bribery is a struggle between legitimate industrialists and businessmen and illegal merchants who engage in bribery. Every industrialist and businessman must participate in this movement. Subsequently, four people, including Si Huaxuan, Wang Zunze, and Wang Yingbin, corrupt elements of the trade department, confessed their crimes of corruption on the spot. Si Huaxuan was an employee of the Southwest District Company of the China Native Produce Company, responsible for copper collection work. He had colluded with four copper-selling merchants to embezzle money twenty-seven times. The corrupt element Ge Zunfu was the Deputy Section Chief of the Hardware Section of the Southwest District Company of the China Equipment Company. He confessed that in the procurement of materials, he had told private merchants the quantity, specifications, and minimum bid price in advance in exchange for bribes from illegal merchants. These facts of corruption and bribery aroused the indignation of all the people present, and they kept requesting to go on stage to expose corrupt and bribery elements. Xia Shangwen, a shop assistant in the hardware industry, exposed the crimes of Huang Kang and Ou Yingtang, employees of the Southwest District Company of the China Equipment Company, who colluded with private merchants to embezzle money. Yang Jinong, a shop assistant in the import and export trade industry, exposed Xu Shibang, the leader of the mountain goods group of the Southwest District Company of the China Native Produce Company, and Xie Enshi, a member of the group, who used their positions to collude with merchants to purchase moldy and spoiled goods at high prices, embezzling six million yuan. After confessing his crimes, the corrupt element Si Huaxuan exposed two other corrupt elements on the spot.
