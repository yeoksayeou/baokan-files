    Kaifeng City Warehouse First Branch Li Jinbang and Others
    Punished for Stealing State Public Grain
    Li Jinbang, director of the Kaifeng City Warehouse First Branch, and others have been dismissed and handed over to the court for stealing state public grain.
    In 1949, Li Jinbang, director of the Guanfang Street Warehouse in Kaifeng City, and Jiang Chunren (retained personnel), a warehouse clerk, colluded in advance to steal and sell more than 2,000 catties of wheat under the guise of borrowing (Jiang wrote an IOU, Li approved it), earning 700,000 yuan, which they split between themselves. In the autumn grain collection of the same year, due to the mutual conversion between new and old scales, the grain was increased by more than 2,000 catties, which was divided equally among more than ten people in the warehouse. At the loot-sharing meeting, Li Jinbang proposed: "No one is allowed to talk about this outside; whoever talks will be held responsible." Warehouse clerk Tang Weizhong even forced everyone to sign and stamp their seals on the spot. Once, Tian Jinming and Nie Xincai (both retained personnel) stole more than 1,490 catties of wheat, and Li Quanshan (retained personnel) also stole 500 catties of wheat. In addition, flour, soybeans, rice, mung beans, and other grains in the warehouse were often stolen or used casually to "improve meals." Nie Xincai trafficked large quantities of opium and "laohai" (more than fifty taels each time), which were sold by Jiang Chunren, who also regularly used drugs. Li Jinbang not only did not investigate these illegal phenomena but colluded with them to carry out collective embezzlement. According to the investigation results, this warehouse had a total of more than 8,000 catties of grain and public property stolen and embezzled by individuals or collectively. In October last year, the People's Supervision Committee of the Henan Provincial People's Government and relevant departments jointly inspected the illegal acts of Li Jinbang and others and decided to dismiss Li Jinbang, Nie Xincai, Jiang Chunren, Tian Jinming, Li Quanshan, and others from their posts and hand them over to the court for legal action.

    开封市仓库第一分库李金榜等
    盗窃国家公粮受到处分
    开封市仓库第一分库主任李金榜等盗窃国家公粮，已受到撤职处分并送法院法办。
    一九四九年，开封市官房街仓库主任李金榜、库员蒋纯仁（留用人员）事先商妥，用外借名义（蒋写借条、李批准），盗卖小麦两千多斤，得款七十万元，两人分赃。同年秋季收粮时，因新秤老秤互折，计涨高粮两千多斤，仓库十多人平分了。李金榜在分赃会议上提出：“任何人不准外谈，谁谈谁负责任。”库员唐维中并强迫大家当场签字盖章。一次，田金铭、聂新才（均系留用人员）两人，偷了小麦一千四百九十多斤，李泉山（留用人员）也偷过小麦五百斤。此外，仓库的面粉、黄豆、大米、绿豆等粮食，经常被偷，或被随便动用“改善伙食”。聂新才大批贩卖大烟、老海（每次都在五十两以上），都由蒋纯仁负责出卖，蒋本人还经常吸毒品。李金榜对这些违法现象不但不加追问，反和他们伙同一起，进行集体贪污。据调查结果，这个仓库前后被个人或集体偷盗与贪污的粮食、公物，共计小麦八千多斤。去年十月间，河南省人民政府人民监察委员会和各有关部门联合检查了李金榜等的犯法行为，决定给李金榜、聂新才、蒋纯仁、田金铭、李泉山等以撤职处分，并送法院法办。
