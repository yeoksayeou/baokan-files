    Notice from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council
    (52) Finance and Economics Plan (Transportation) No. 90 (No separate document will be issued)
To all ministries, administrations, and bureaus of the Central Government, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, all major administrative regions, and the Financial Committees of the five provinces and two cities of North China: From January 1st to 3rd, 1952, the national railway (excluding narrow-gauge) loading plan only completed 83.5%. The main reason is that the consignment departments did not consign goods according to the plan. If this is not corrected, it will cause a significant waste of national transportation capacity. Now that the Spring Festival is approaching, it is hoped that all departments will strictly consign goods according to the original plan based on the Notice No. Finance and Economics 2677 issued by this committee on December 26, 1951, establish a duty system for transportation personnel at all levels, and ensure that the loading plan proceeds as usual. Employees performing loading and unloading duties during the Spring Festival should be paid double wages.
