    Volunteer Army Representatives Visited Our "Anti-Waste Exhibition"
    Comrade Editor: On January 24th, a group of representatives from the Volunteer Army returning home came to give us a report. The student union asked me to lead them on a visit to the "Anti-Waste Exhibition" held by our school. During the visit, I thought: the Volunteer Army brought back to us inspiring stories of bravely fighting the enemy and cherishing the motherland's resources, but what we are showing them today are wasted items worth more than 1.5 billion. The more I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I felt. When I asked them to give suggestions for the exhibition, I was so ashamed that I almost cried. Comrade Zhao Xiaoyun wrote in the comments book: "After seeing this anti-waste exhibition, my confidence in protecting the property of the motherland has been strengthened."
    After this incident, I further understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and I am determined to: more actively participate in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    志愿军代表参观了我们的“反对浪费展览会”
    编辑同志：一月二十四日志愿军归国代表团的一部分代表来给我们作报告。学生会让我领着他们去参观我校举办的“反对浪费展览会”。在参观过程中，我想：志愿军给我们带回来的是前方英勇杀敌和爱护祖国资财的感人事迹，而我们今天给他们看的却是价值超过十五亿以上的浪费物品。我越想心中越感到不自在。当我请他们给展览会提意见时，我简直惭愧的哭了起来。赵霄云同志在意见簿上写着：“看了这个反浪费展览，加强了我保护祖国财产的信心。”
    我在这件事情以后，更进一步地了解了毛主席关于增产节约号召的伟大意义，下定决心：更积极地投入反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动。
