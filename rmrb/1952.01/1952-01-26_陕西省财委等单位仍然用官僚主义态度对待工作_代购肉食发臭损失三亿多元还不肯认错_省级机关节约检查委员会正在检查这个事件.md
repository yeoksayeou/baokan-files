    As the people of the whole country vigorously launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, leading cadres of the Shaanxi Provincial Finance and Economics Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Provincial Finance Committee), the Commerce Department, the Trade Corporation, the Meat Company, and the Cooperative Bureau still treat their work with a bureaucratic attitude, resulting in the spoilage of meat purchased on behalf of a certain department at the end of last year, with a loss of over 300 million yuan. In December of last year, these units purchased pork and chicken on behalf of a certain department. In the process of this purchase, the leading cadres of these units did not carefully study the actual situation or the temperature, and they neglected to inspect their work, causing 80,000 catties of the purchased pork to rot, resulting in an estimated loss of nearly 200 million yuan, excluding the portion that could be sold cheaply; the loss of chicken due to spoilage and the difference between purchase and sales prices was about 150 million yuan.
    In December of last year, the department decided to purchase 10,000 pigs and 100,000 chickens, and specified the dates, packaging standards, and specifications, also pointing out that the meat had to be frozen before shipment. After the manager of Shaanxi Meat Company, Cheng Hongli, brought back the task, the Northwest Military and Political Committee Trade Department instructed the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Commerce to complete it. The Provincial Department of Commerce, under the leadership of the Provincial Finance Committee, coordinated with the Provincial Trade Corporation, the Meat Company, and the Cooperative Bureau to study and arrange the work. The Provincial Finance Committee issued two telegrams to the finance committees of Baoji, Weinan, Xianyang, and Nanzheng Special Districts on December 8th and 9th, requiring them to complete 25 percent by December 20th, 35 percent by the end of December, and 100 percent by January 15th, 1952. Regarding specific methods and related issues, the instructions only stated that "the Provincial Trade Corporation will send someone to discuss it in person." The issue of the meat needing to be frozen before shipment was not mentioned at all. The task of buying 100,000 chickens was contracted to the Cooperative Bureau. When the director of the Cooperative Bureau, Liu Jinfang, convened a meeting of local cooperatives to arrange the task, he also did not mention the issue of the meat needing to be frozen before shipment. At that time, the leading cadres of the Department of Commerce and related departments did not carefully study and actually test the climate of Northwest China this year, and blindly believed that "meat can probably freeze in winter," so they did not make any arrangements in this regard. After receiving the instructions, various localities quickly purchased large quantities. The masses in various localities, especially the people in areas where land reform had been completed, actively assisted the government in completing the task on time. When the people in a certain area of Weinan heard that the department was buying chickens, they were unwilling to take money and even performed Yangko dances to send them to the government. By December 15th of last year, more than 4,000 pigs and more than 50,000 chickens had been purchased. At that time, the department sent someone to receive them, but because the meat was not thoroughly frozen and could not be shipped, they refused to accept them. The Shaanxi Provincial Trade Corporation only consulted the Department of Commerce on December 18th of last year, and the Department of Commerce only consulted the Provincial Finance Committee on December 22nd about how to handle it. At this time, the Provincial Finance Committee and the Department of Commerce were still hesitant and did not immediately decide on a solution. It was not until December 31st of last year that the Department of Commerce officially notified various localities to stop buying and sell the purchased pigs and chickens locally. But at that time, more than 5,300 pigs and more than 70,000 chickens had been purchased. The pork purchased in Nanzheng Special District was not packaged according to regulations, and about 80,000 catties of the more than 90,000 catties transported to Baoji were rotten; excluding the portion that could be sold cheaply, the estimated loss was 200 million yuan. The deputy manager of the Meat Company, Mr. Li, said: "Comrade Zhang Chengren said when he returned from Nanzheng: When the meat was loaded onto the truck by the Nanzheng Trade Corporation, a truck driver found that a truckload of meat was rotten. But when the driver reported this situation, a responsible cadre of the company said: 'Just transport it anyway!'" Zhao Mingde, the manager of the Nanzheng Trade Corporation, already knew that the meat was rotten when he returned to Nanzheng from a meeting in Xi'an via Baoji, but he did not actively check and deal with it, and was later forced to go by others. These people are so irresponsible towards state property. Because the instructions from the higher authorities were not unified, when the masses delivered meat to the Nanzheng Trade Corporation, the staff of the company said that they "had not received instructions from the higher authorities" and refused to purchase it. The masses were very dissatisfied with this and said that they were "simply eating the people's grain for free." According to preliminary statistics from the Cooperative Bureau, the 70,000 chickens purchased in Nanzheng Special District suffered a total loss of 150.93 million yuan due to weight loss and purchase and sales price differences. According to preliminary statistics, the loss from pigs and chickens amounted to 350.93 million yuan in total (losses in other areas, such as live pigs eating grain and pigs dying during transportation, have not yet been counted). After this problem occurred, when a reporter from the Xi'an Masses Daily interviewed Tian Yuan, a person in charge of the Department of Commerce, on the afternoon of January 7th, Tian actually said: "If it is published in the newspaper, it is best to give the masses more explanation, the problem occurred because the climate was too warm this year." On January 10th, a reporter from the Masses Daily interviewed Cheng Hongli, the manager of the Meat Company, who said: "If I wanted to avoid today's losses, I would not have accepted the task." On January 11th, a reporter from the Masses Daily interviewed Li Weixin, the director of the Department of Commerce, who similarly attributed the loss to "the climate in Shaanxi being too warm this year." On the same day, when a reporter from the Masses Daily visited the Shaanxi Provincial Finance Committee, Gao Wanying, the director of the office who signed the purchase order sent to various localities, still did not know that the purchase of meat had caused such a serious loss. As of January 11th, none of the responsible cadres of the relevant units had made a review of this serious problem. The Shaanxi Provincial-Level Organization Thrift Inspection Committee is currently investigating this issue.

    陕西省财委等单位仍然用官僚主义态度对待工作
    代购肉食发臭损失三亿多元还不肯认错
    省级机关节约检查委员会正在检查这个事件
    正当全国人民大张旗鼓地展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动时，陕西省财政经济委员会（下简称省财委）、商业厅、贸易公司、肉业公司、合作局的领导干部，仍以官僚主义态度对待工作，以致去年年底为某部代购的肉食发臭，损失三亿多元。去年十二月间，这几个单位给某部代购猪肉和鸡。在代购工作中，这些单位的领导干部对实际情况、气候冷热没有认真地研究，对工作又疏于检查，使所购猪肉臭了八万斤，估计除部分可以廉价出售外，损失近二亿元；鸡肉耗损及买卖差价亏损约一亿五千多万元。
    某部去年十二月间决定购猪一万头，鸡十万只，对于日期、包装的标准、规格等都有决定，并指出肉要冻了以后才能起运。陕西省肉业公司经理成红黎把任务带回后，西北军政委员会贸易部责成陕西省商业厅完成。省商业厅在省财委领导下，协同省贸易公司、肉业公司、合作局研究布置工作。省财委在十二月八、九日两次向宝鸡、渭南、咸阳、南郑各专区财委发出电示，限于一九五一年十二月二十日完成百分之二十五，十二月底完成百分之三十五，一九五二年一月十五日全部完成。关于具体作法和有关问题，指示中只说是“省贸易公司派人前来面洽”。肉不冻不能起运的问题根本没有谈。买十万只鸡的任务交由合作局包干完成。合作局局长刘进芳召集各地合作社会议布置任务时，也根本没有讲肉不冻不能起运的问题。当时商业厅及有关部门领导干部，对今年西北的气候没有认真的研究和实际的试验，盲目地认为“冬季肉大概可以冻”，就没有作关于这方面的布置。各地接到指示后，就迅速地大量收购。各地群众，特别是土地改革完成地区的人民，更是积极协助政府按时完成这个任务。渭南某地群众听说某部买鸡，都不肯要钱，并且扭起秧歌向政府送。到去年十二月十五日，已购得猪四千多头、鸡五万多只。当时某部派人来接收，但因肉没有冻透不能起运，拒绝接收。陕西省贸易公司在去年十二月十八日才请示商业厅，商业厅二十二日才请示省财委怎样处理。这时省财委和商业厅仍然犹豫不决，没有立即决定处理办法。直到去年十二月三十一日，商业厅才正式通知各地停购，并把已购的猪、鸡就地抛售。但当时已购猪五千三百多头、鸡七万多只。南郑专区购得的猪肉因包装不合规定，运到宝鸡九万多斤大约臭了八万斤；除部分可以廉价出售外，估计损失二亿元。肉业公司李副经理谈：“张成仁同志从南郑回来说：肉从南郑贸易公司装车起运时，一个汽车司机就发现一车肉臭了。但司机反映这个情况时，这个公司的一个负责干部却说：‘你运着走你的吧！’”南郑贸易公司经理赵明德，由西安开会返南郑路经宝鸡时，已经知道肉臭了，却不去积极查看处理，后来还是被别人硬叫着去的。这些人，对国家财产就是这样不负责任。由于上级指示不统一，当群众给南郑贸易公司交肉时，这个公司的职员说“没接到上级指示”，不肯收购。群众对这非常不满，说他们“简直是白吃人民的粮食”。南郑专区买的七万只鸡，据合作局初步统计，重量耗损和买卖差价亏损，共计损失一亿五千零九十三万多元。猪、鸡两项损失，据初步统计，共三亿五千零九十三万多元（其他地区损失，如活猪吃粮、运输中死了的猪等还没统计）。这个问题发生后，西安群众日报的记者一月七日下午访问商业厅的一个负责人田园时，田竟然说：“如果报上发表，最好多给群众解释，问题的发生是因为今年气候太暖。”一月十日，群众日报的记者又访问肉业公司成红黎经理，成竟说：“如果要避免今天的损失，我就不要接受任务。”群众日报的记者十一日又访问商业厅厅长李维新，李同样地把这次损失归咎于“今年陕西气候太暖”。同一天，群众日报的记者访问陕西省财委时，曾在发往各地的购肉指示电稿上签字的办公室主任高万英竟然还不知道购肉已造成了这样严重的损失。直到十一日为止，各有关单位的负责干部还没有一个人对这个严重问题作过检讨。现在陕西省级机关节约检查委员会，对这一问题正在进行检查中。
