To the Editor:

The lime produced by the Zhoukoudian Lime Factory, affiliated with the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Property Custody Bureau's Construction Materials Factory, has always been transported to Beijing by train for use in the construction of public housing in the capital. In October of last year, the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau approved the allocation of sixty wagons to the Lime Factory, but only fifteen wagons were actually allocated. In November, another sixty wagons were approved, but only two were allocated. In December, fifty wagons were approved, but to date, not a single one has been allocated. For more than two months, the Materials Factory has had to use trucks for transportation due to the urgent need for lime in construction projects. The truck freight cost per ton of lime is 117,000 yuan higher than the train freight cost. The Materials Factory has transported a total of 263 tons of lime by truck, resulting in a waste of over 30 million yuan in transportation costs. Furthermore, because truck transportation of lime is insufficient to meet the needs of the construction site, the Materials Factory has had to purchase lime from private merchants. The price of lime from private merchants is higher, resulting in another loss of over 28 million yuan for the Materials Factory. On the factory side, 3,600 tons of lime have accumulated due to the lack of wagons to transport the products. Because this lime has been stored for too long, some of the lime blocks have gradually turned into powder, resulting in a loss of approximately 1,064 tons. With a cost of 140,000 yuan per ton, the total loss is over 148 million yuan. At the same time, the factory's stockpiling of 3,600 tons of lime is equivalent to the immobilization of 504 million yuan in capital. I hope that the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau will seriously study the problem of its inability to allocate wagons in order to overcome the resulting waste.

Editor's Note: The Beijing Railway Sub-bureau has already reviewed the criticism raised by Comrade Lu Zhongshu and is studying ways to improve the allocation of wagons.

### 北京铁路分局  不调拨已批准的车皮造成清管局工厂很大浪费

    北京铁路分局
    不调拨已批准的车皮造成清管局工厂很大浪费
    编辑同志：北京市人民政府公逆产清管局建筑材料厂所属周口店制灰厂生产的石灰，向来由火车运到北京，供应首都公产房屋修建应用。去年十月份，北京铁路分局虽批准拨给制灰厂车皮六十辆，但实际上只拨了十五辆；十一月份，又批准拨六十辆，结果只拨给两辆；十二月份又批准拨五十辆，但到目前为止，连一辆也没有拨给。两个多月来，材料厂因工程上急需使用石灰，不得不用卡车运输。每吨石灰的卡车运费比火车运费多十一万七千元。材料厂用卡车共运二百六十三吨石灰，就浪费了三千多万元运输费。又因为用卡车运石灰不够工地需要，材料厂不得不向私商购买石灰。私商的石灰价格较高，材料厂又损失了二千八百多万元。在制灰厂方面，因无车皮运出产品，积存了石灰三千六百吨。这些石灰因积存时间过长，部分灰块逐渐变成粉末，约损失一千零六十四吨，每吨的成本以十四万元计算，共损失一亿四千八百多万元。同时，厂方堆积了三千六百吨的石灰，就相等于积压了五亿零四百万元的资金。我希望北京铁路分局认真地研究不能调拨车皮的问题，以便克服由此而来的浪费。　路仲舒
    编者按：北京铁路分局已经对路仲舒同志提出的批评作了检讨，并研究了改进调拨车皮的办法。
