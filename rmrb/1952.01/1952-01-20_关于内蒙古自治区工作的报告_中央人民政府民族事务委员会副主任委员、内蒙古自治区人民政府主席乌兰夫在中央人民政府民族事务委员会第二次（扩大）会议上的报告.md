Comrades Members, Representatives and Comrades,

I agree with Deputy Premier Dong’s political report and Vice Chairman Liu’s report on the work of nationalities over the past two years. I will only give a report on the work of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in recent years.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established four and a half years ago—on May 1, 1947—based on Chairman Mao's policy of national equality and national regional autonomy.

Since then, the people of Inner Mongolia have realized their long-cherished desire to eliminate foreign national oppression and internal feudal oppression and to implement national equality and democracy. In the past four years, especially since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the construction undertakings of the people of Inner Mongolia have achieved great development under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government.

The current Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region: the agricultural areas have completed land reform and launched a large-scale bumper harvest movement; the pastoral areas have also carried out steady democratic reform and launched a livestock increase and protection movement; people's armed forces have been built, and the language, writing, culture, and education of the Mongolian nationality have been developed... In the past year, patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries have been carried out more systematically. After several years of work, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has moved from a backward social situation into a new democratic society. Whether in politics, economy, or culture, it has changed its past appearance and presents a prosperous atmosphere; the people's lives have been greatly improved, national oppression and discrimination have been eliminated, and a new relationship of equality, friendship, unity, and mutual assistance between nationalities has been established and is becoming increasingly consolidated.

In the past few years, the Mongolian and Han people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have personally experienced a truth: Without the wise and great ethnic policies of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government: national equality and regional autonomy, and if they were not closely united under the leadership of Chairman Mao and united in the big family of the motherland, all these changes, developments, and progress would be absolutely impossible.

In the past few years, we have done the following major tasks:

First, we implemented national regional autonomy, mobilized the masses of the people, broadly united all classes, and steadily carried out social reforms.

In the past, imperialism and its running dogs—the Northern Warlords, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the Mongolian traitors Demchugdongrub and Li Shou-hsin and their ilk—created hatred and antagonism between the Mongolian and Han nationalities in Inner Mongolia, causing the vast number of people to live a life of slavery for a long time.

Although the Inner Mongolian people had waged a long struggle for national liberation throughout history, the results were all failures.

Only under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese People's Liberation Army could the people of Inner Mongolia organize themselves, bravely participate in the struggle against Japanese imperialism and against U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and implement national regional autonomy to achieve victory.

Among the Mongolian nationality, some once believed that regional autonomy could not solve the national question and could not enable the nationality to develop and progress, advocating "independent autonomy"; others believed that regional autonomy was autonomy for the Han nationality, thus not recognizing national equality within the autonomous region; and still others believed that regional autonomy was completely unrelated to democracy and progress, thus opposing the implementation of any degree of democratic reform in the autonomous region. Today's facts prove that all these are wrong.

The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was elected by the people's congress of Inner Mongolia itself. After the establishment of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, according to the demands of the people of Inner Mongolia, land reform was carried out in the agricultural areas, feudal privileges were abolished in the pastoral areas, the masses were mobilized, and at the same time, all ethnic groups and strata of people who opposed U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries and supported the implementation of democratic autonomy were united, and the counter-revolutionary forces were victoriously opposed. After transformation from top to bottom and then from bottom to top, governments at all levels have been transformed into governments of the people themselves.

The connection between the people's government and the broad masses of the people has become closer year by year. Since last year, people's representatives conferences of all ethnic groups and circles have been held three to four times in each league, banner, county, and city, and nearly 2,000 gacha (administrative villages) governments have implemented democratic elections. The representatives of the people's representatives conferences include workers, peasants, herdsmen, business circles, women, intellectuals, lamas, and also past princes. At the people's representatives conferences, representatives of all ethnic groups and strata unite and intimately discuss solving their own internal problems and the major tasks of building a new Inner Mongolia.

According to the principle of national regional autonomy, areas where ethnic minorities such as the Oroqen people live in concentrated communities have established their own banner or nutuk (district) autonomous governments, and under the unified leadership of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, they manage their own affairs. In areas where there are particularly many Han people, national democratic joint governments have been realized. For example, among the 1,272 representatives of the People's Representatives Conferences in various banners, counties, and cities of the Hinggan League, Mongolian representatives accounted for 47.4 percent, Han representatives accounted for 51.6 percent, and Korean and Hui representatives accounted for 1 percent. Among the 2,600 people's representatives in the fourteen banners, counties, and cities of the Hulunbuir, Jirem, and Hinggan Leagues, representatives of ethnic minorities other than Mongolian and Han accounted for more than 3 percent. All ethnic groups fully enjoy equal rights, and the customs and habits of all ethnic groups are respected.

Without the unity and cooperation and mutual assistance of the Mongolian and Han nationalities, the construction and development of Inner Mongolia would be impossible.

The process of implementing regional autonomy, national equality, democratic reforms, and fighting against the counter-revolutionary forces of U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries is also the process of enhancing the patriotism and national consciousness of the Mongolian people.

In carrying out various democratic reforms, we must first pay attention to transforming the old armed forces to make them the people's armed forces. Under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we actively and steadily relied on cultivating progressive youth, establishing and strengthening political work in the troops, and carrying out ideological transformation to transform and establish an Inner Mongolia People's Cavalry.

This Inner Mongolia People's Force, in the Liberation War, cooperated with fraternal troops to defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries' offensive and wiped out bandits in Inner Mongolia, annihilating more than 22,000 enemies and seizing more than 22,000 war horses. In combat training, it learned from the Chinese People's Liberation Army in all aspects, developed and grew stronger, and became a part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the unified command and unified system of the state. It is now vigilantly defending the production and construction and local order of Inner Mongolia together with the Inner Mongolia Public Security Forces and the militias in various parts of Inner Mongolia, and is actively participating in national construction to consolidate national defense.

Second, in the economic field, various productions were rapidly restored and developed, and people's lives were improved, thereby encouraging the patriotic enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the working people of Inner Mongolia, who are gradually overcoming the backward state left over from history.

In the past, the Inner Mongolian nationality and the people of Inner Mongolia were subjected to the economic exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Before liberation, production shrank, disasters continued, epidemics spread, and bandits rose up, and the people were in a state of hunger and cold. Now they have turned themselves over, social order is stable, various productions have been rapidly restored and developed, and people's lives have been greatly improved. The Communist Party of China has brought a happy life to the vast number of working people in Inner Mongolia.

After the establishment of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, based on the different conditions of agriculture, animal husbandry, and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia, it formulated and implemented different guidelines for developing production. In the agricultural areas, land reform was implemented, and all ethnic groups were equally distributed a piece of land, thus the peasants' enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly improved. Since 1948, a large-scale production movement has been launched throughout Inner Mongolia. In the past, cultivation was rough, and little fertilizer and seed selection were done. Now, the average fertilizer application area in the region will reach 30 percent of the cultivated area, and seed selection and seed disinfection are implemented in most areas to prevent diseases and insect pests. In order to prevent floods, in 1950, the People's Government mobilized more than 4.2 million laborers and a part of the troops to build the Liaohe Dike, which was more than 2,000 li long, reducing the disaster-stricken area from 137,000 hectares in 1949 to more than 4,000 hectares in 1950. Due to the promotion of labor mutual assistance, the awarding of labor models, the expansion of cultivated area, the awarding of intensive farming, the use of new agricultural implements, and the issuance of agricultural loans, drought relief, and other measures to increase grain production, the grain output of Inner Mongolia has exceeded the pre-liberation level. Taking Hulunbuir League as an example: before land reform, the average yield per hectare was 1,200 jin, and in 1950, the average yield per hectare increased to 1,600 jin to 1,700 jin. Although Inner Mongolia suffered a fairly widespread and severe drought this year, with an average harvest of only 45 percent in the region, we are confident that we can save ourselves through production and tide over the disaster, given that most of the masses have some savings and are actively developing sideline businesses.

In the pastoral areas, feudal privileges were abolished, and a policy of free grazing, increasing livestock, and protecting livestock was implemented. We vigorously advocated and promoted epidemic prevention, wolf eradication, regulation of breeding livestock, improvement of livestock methods, grass cutting, well digging, and shed construction, and issued a large number of loans, thus the livestock breeding rate generally increased. This year, the breeding rate in various places has exceeded 70 percent, and the survival rate of young livestock has reached more than 90 percent. The increase in the number of livestock in recent years is considerable. In 1950, the total number of livestock increased by 10.7 percent compared with 1949, and by 14 percent compared with 1948, and this year it can exceed the plan to increase by 11.7 percent on the basis of last year. If we compare the number of livestock in the pastoral areas this year with the number when it was just liberated in 1945, some areas have more than doubled, and each herdsman in New Barag Right Banner has an average of 70 livestock. The vast number of herdsmen are unprecedentedly rich, and a thriving new scene is presented everywhere on the vast grasslands.

Based on the needs of national economic development, as well as the specific conditions of local natural conditions, people's lives, and production outlets, a policy of "prohibiting reclamation and protecting pastures" was clearly put forward for the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas this year. The experience of the past year has proved that this policy not only solves the problem of the direction and steps of production development in this region, but also gradually solves the contradictions between the Mongolian and Han people caused by the conflict of interests on land issues in agricultural and animal husbandry production. In some areas, due to inconvenient transportation, it is difficult to transport agricultural grain out; in some areas, the climate and soil are suitable for animal husbandry, and the local people feel that "it is better to raise a cow than to cultivate a hectare of land." The proportion of animal husbandry兼营 by farmers in their economic life has increased day by day. Therefore, protecting pastures has gradually become a common requirement of the Mongolian and Han people, and the unity and mutual assistance of the Mongolian and Han people has been strengthened on the basis of common production and life.

The reason why the agricultural and animal husbandry production of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been restored and developed so rapidly, in addition to the implementation of land reform, the abolition of feudal privileges, and a series of policies to develop production, is that there is also a very important experience, that is, the universal establishment of state-owned trade organizations and cooperatives serving the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production, which rapidly and systematically changed the past serious unequal exchange in order to ensure the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production, thereby accumulating funds and establishing industrial production. While carrying out land reform, we first vigorously built state-owned trade undertakings; through the assistance of state-owned trade, we systematically organized cooperatives universally on the basis of mass movements. Now, state-owned trade organizations and cooperatives have been universally established in various parts of Inner Mongolia, and the number of cooperative members will soon reach one-third of the total population. In this way, the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas has been effectively strengthened, the scissors difference between the prices of industrial, agricultural, and animal products has been greatly reduced, the unequal exchange that existed in history has been basically eliminated, and the agricultural and animal husbandry contradictions have been turned into agricultural and animal husbandry mutual assistance, effectively stimulating the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production, and providing conditions for the establishment of industry. Due to the above, the masses' lives have indeed improved. In 1950, the masses' purchasing power was 460.4 percent of that in 1948, an increase of more than three times.

The Central People's Government and the Northeast People's Government helped various constructions in Inner Mongolia through trade work, and the Central People's Government also allocated a fairly broad financial authority to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region under the unified financial system, which is an important measure to enable the people of Inner Mongolia to carry out some construction work.

With the help of the Central and Northeast People's Governments, the operation of forestry production has also been progressing year by year, and especially the work of fire prevention and forest protection has achieved great results this year. The establishment of the Oroqen Banner has more effectively promoted fire prevention work.

Third, actively develop cultural and health undertakings.

In the past, the Inner Mongolian nationality and the people of Inner Mongolia, under the rule of internal and external reactionary forces, were pushed into the abyss of ignorance, superstition, disease, and disaster, and driven towards the road of destruction. After the establishment of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, with the improvement of the people's economic life, the people's cultural, educational, and health undertakings have been developed in a planned way. The government clearly stipulates that important official documents should be written in both Mongolian and Han languages, guarantees freedom of religious belief, and promotes and publicizes scientific knowledge. In the development of culture and education, the first is to rectify schools and popularize education. Now, the number of children enrolled in Inner Mongolia accounts for more than 61 percent of the total number of school-age children, an increase of about three times compared with the puppet Manchukuo period; there are more than 3,800 middle school students. In order to overcome the difficulties for Mongolian children to attend school, the treatment of state-funded students has been set up. In terms of the school system and teaching materials, the problem of developing the Mongolian language and writing has been resolved. All of the primary and junior high school teaching materials and a part of the senior high school teaching materials have been translated into Mongolian textbooks; in 1950 alone, 45 kinds of Mongolian textbooks were published and printed more than 300,000 copies. In addition, many theoretical works (mainly Chairman Mao's works) and popular reading materials were translated, Mongolian newspapers were published, and Mongolian radio broadcasts were established. The tendency to neglect the development of the Mongolian language and writing that once occurred has been basically corrected.

Regarding health undertakings, the People's Government has determined the policy of "prosperity for both people and livestock." With the help of the Central and Northeast People's Governments, after five years of efforts, the principles of "prevention is more important than treatment" and "combining technology and the masses" have been correctly implemented, thus effectively controlling the plague. For example, in 1947, more than 17,000 people suffered from the plague and more than 13,000 people died. In 1948, more than 2,000 people suffered from the plague. In 1949, more than 200 people suffered from the plague. From 1950 to February this year, a total of 77 people suffered from the plague. The number of patients has gradually decreased year by year, and the mortality rate has also been greatly reduced. Now it is possible to put out the plague on the spot as soon as it occurs. Syphilis is extremely common in Inner Mongolia. Statistics in the pastoral areas show that patients account for 60 percent of the total population, and many men and women cannot have children. Since 1950, syphilis eradication work has begun in Hulunbuir League, and it has now been promoted to Xilin Gol League. Significant results have been achieved in inspection and treatment. According to statistics, universal treatment has been carried out in six nomadic banners, and 30,973 syphilis patients have been inspected, accounting for 69.5 percent of the total population of the six banners; 12,762 people have been treated, accounting for 41.2 percent of the total number of syphilis patients. The population in some areas has relatively increased. For example, in Chen Barag Banner, before syphilis prevention and treatment, the average annual population decrease was 43 people in the four years from 1945 to 1949. After the banner started syphilis eradication work, 50 babies were added in 1950 alone, and 36 were added from January to May 1951. The population of Inner Mongolia has not only stopped declining, but has also begun to increase. In the past few years of epidemic prevention and control and more than a year of syphilis eradication, a group of Mongolian health cadres have been trained. In the syphilis eradication work alone, 746 grassroots health workers have been trained; four banners have established health centers, 21 sumu (districts) have established health stations, and mass prevention and treatment committees at all levels have laid the foundation for health and medical work in Inner Mongolia.

Fourth, due to the realization of regional autonomy, the implementation of democratic reforms, and the development of production, it is more convenient to universally carry out patriotic education, especially in the past year. Combined with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, patriotic education has been deepened among the broad masses of the people. The patriotism of the people of Inner Mongolia is extremely high, not only manifested in actively participating in the peace signature campaign and the "May Day" Grand Demonstration, but also manifested in actively donating weapons. Even in the case of disaster, the payment of the Inner Mongolia donation movement reached more than 34 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan by 47 percent. In addition, there were more than 30,000 jin of meat floss and 12,000 yellow sheep.

Now, patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is being further deepened in various places, and a movement to increase production and practice economy is being launched.

Fifth, vigorously train cadres and strengthen the unity of cadres of all ethnic groups. This is the decisive key to smoothly implementing the various policies of the Central People's Government and promoting various tasks.

As early as the Great Revolution of 1925-1927, the Communist Party of China paid great attention to helping train cadres of ethnic minorities. During the Anti-Japanese War, it ran the Nationalities Institute and other schools in Yan'an to vigorously train ethnic cadres, including many Mongolian cadres. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it also ran the Inner Mongolia Military and Political College, the Autonomous College, and other schools. After the establishment of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, it also established the Inner Mongolia Military and Political University, the Administrative Cadre School, as well as health cadre schools, cooperative cadre training classes, animal epidemic training classes, and accounting training classes to train various working cadres, and successively sent 485 people to study in universities and specialized schools in other regions. In 1950, it also established the Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle School and the Workers' and Peasants' Cultural Supplementary School to improve the cultural level of Mongolian and Han cadres. In this way, through school training and cultivation in work, Inner Mongolia has trained more than 25,000 cadres of all ethnic groups in recent years. Among them, Mongolian people accounted for more than 11,000 people. This is an important guarantee for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to promote and complete various tasks. They not only do general work, but also a group of them have assumed guidance work. Among the 18 members of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, Mongolian members accounted for 15. Among the 31 directors and deputy directors of departments and bureaus, Mongolian cadres accounted for 17. Among the 12 directors and deputy directors of the six leagues, Mongolian cadres accounted for 7. There are 43 Mongolian cadres serving as banner directors and deputy directors. A large number of Mongolian cadres are also working in other party organs, governments, mass organizations, postal and telecommunications, taxation, forestry, trade, financial institutions, and cultural institutions.

Experience has proved that Mongolian young intellectuals are eager for the liberation of their own nationality and are easy to accept progressive ideas. However, due to the extremely cruel oppression of ethnic minorities by Han chauvinism in history, ethnic minorities (including the Mongolian nationality) are prone to distrust and narrow-minded nationalism towards the major nationality. At first, they often proceed from the national standpoint, and their class standpoint is vague. Their support for the Communist Party also proceeds from the "national standpoint." It is necessary to patiently educate them so that they can gain experience and improve their awareness in actual struggles, gradually integrate with the workers and peasants, and be transformed. Practice has proved that they can be transformed. In recent years, after in-depth ethnic policy education, the struggle against the enemies of the people within their own nationality who colluded with U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the land reform movement, most Mongolian cadres have been able to look at national issues from a class standpoint. Their internationalist consciousness has been raised, and their patriotic consciousness has also been raised, thus narrow-minded nationalism has been gradually overcome. For example, they used to be suspicious of Han working cadres. Now they have personally experienced the importance of Han assistance. They welcome Han cadres to serve the people of Inner Mongolia. Most of them have been armed with Mao Zedong Thought and are national and state cadres.

Experience has also proved that to carry out work in ethnic minority areas, including the work of training ethnic minority cadres, there must be a group of high-quality old cadres as the backbone, which is especially necessary when starting to establish work. Since most of the old cadres are Han cadres, when they first came to work in Inner Mongolia, some comrades inevitably had a sense of superiority of the major nationality and easily looked down on or did not trust Mongolian cadres, feeling that Mongolian new cadres had not been tested, and therefore were not good at adopting a humble attitude of consulting and patiently helping when encountering things, and often had a paternalistic style. In addition, some comrades inevitably had a "sojourner mentality," not making long-term plans, and were prone to committing "impatience" and "copying" mistakes in work, not concentrating on studying the Mongolian situation, and not willing to learn the Mongolian language and writing, and not able to subtly understand the psychology and feelings of Mongolian comrades, and therefore could not actively communicate with Mongolian comrades. For these comrades, the leadership must patiently persuade them, help them sum up experience, eliminate the "sojourner" mentality, serve the people of ethnic minorities wholeheartedly, pay attention to ethnic forms, deeply understand the feelings of the Mongolian masses, study and analyze the social situation in Inner Mongolia, patiently help Mongolian comrades, and humbly learn from Mongolian comrades in order to do a good job. This is an arduous task, but under the education of the Communist Party of China, they now have deep feelings for the broad masses of the people of Inner Mongolia and are wholeheartedly working in the Autonomous Region.

Strengthening the unity of Mongolian and Han cadres is the key to the unity of the Mongolian and Han people. We constantly pay attention to this work. In the Autonomous Region, we have adopted the method of criticism and self-criticism to educate the Mongolian people, especially Mongolian cadres, to overcome and prevent narrow-minded nationalist tendencies; at the same time, we educate the Han people, especially Han cadres, to conscientiously respect the equal rights of ethnic minorities from all aspects, respect the opinions of ethnic minority people, and eliminate Han chauvinist tendencies.

From the above facts, it can be fully seen that the people of Inner Mongolia have been liberated, not only enjoying the equal rights of nationality in politics, but also carrying out a series of appropriate social reforms within themselves, thereby enabling their construction in various aspects to develop rapidly and consolidating the brotherly new relationship between ethnic groups.

The people of Inner Mongolia fully understand that only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, only under the conditions that the people of Inner Mongolia organize themselves to be masters of their own affairs, can they get all these benefits. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia increasingly love Chairman Mao, increasingly trust and support the Central People's Government, and their national consciousness and enthusiasm for people's construction are getting higher and higher. This fully proves that the implementation of national regional autonomy is indeed the most suitable and reasonable policy for solving the national problems in China, is the central link in promoting various tasks in ethnic minority areas, and is a major measure to realize the various policies of new democracy through ethnic forms.

The people of Inner Mongolia fully understand that the development of the Mongolian nationality in politics, economy, and culture must have the cooperation of the Han nationality in the Autonomous Region and the great help of the Han people throughout the country. The Han nationality is the main ethnic group in the Chinese ethnic family, and it is an advanced ethnic group compared with other ethnic groups in China. Unity and cooperation with the Han nationality and other ethnic groups in China and striving for their help are important conditions for the smooth development of the Mongolian nationality.

In the past few years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, and with the joint efforts of the Mongolian and Han people and Mongolian and Han cadres in Inner Mongolia, the work of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved certain results. However, due to the lack of work experience of cadres, especially leading cadres, and the low level of policy, some mistakes have also been made, and many shortcomings have occurred. I believe that in the future, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, and through the active efforts of the Mongolian and Han people and cadres, the work will surely be able to move forward further and make more achievements.

I have briefly introduced the situation in Inner Mongolia, and I hope that the members and representatives attending the meeting will give criticism and corrections.

Long live the unity of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people of all nationalities!

    关于内蒙古自治区工作的报告
    ——中央人民政府民族事务委员会副主任委员、内蒙古自治区人民政府主席乌兰夫在中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次（扩大）会议上的报告各位委员、各位代表、各位同志：
    董副总理的政治报告和刘副主任委员关于两年来民族工作的报告，我都同意。我仅就内蒙古自治区几年来的工作作一个报告。
    内蒙古自治区是在四年半以前——一九四七年五月一日，根据毛主席的民族平等和民族区域自治的政策而成立的。
    从此，内蒙古人民实现了多年来的扫除外来的民族压迫和内部的封建压迫、实行民族平等和民主的愿望；四年来特别是中华人民共和国成立以来，在中央人民政府统一领导下，内蒙人民的建设事业得到巨大的发展。
    现在的内蒙古自治区：农业区已完成了土地改革，开展了大规模的丰产运动；牧业区也进行了稳当的民主改革，开展了增畜保畜运动；建设了人民武装，发展了蒙古民族的语言文字和文化教育事业……。近一年来，更系统地进行了抗美援朝爱国主义教育和镇压反革命运动。内蒙古自治区经过几年的工作，已从落后的社会状况，进入到新民主主义社会；无论在政治上、经济上、文化上，都改变了过去的面貌，呈现着欣欣向荣的气象；人民生活极大地改善了，民族间的压迫和歧视消除了，民族间平等、友爱、团结、互助的新关系已经建立并日益巩固了。
    几年来内蒙古自治区的蒙、汉各族人民已亲身体验了一个真理：如果没有中国共产党、毛主席、中央人民政府的英明和伟大的民族政策：民族平等和区域自治，如果不是紧密地团结在毛主席的领导下，团结在祖国的大家庭中，所有这一切变化、发展和进步，都是绝对不可能的。
    几年来，我们作了以下几件主要的工作：
    第一、实行了民族的区域自治，发动了人民群众，广泛地团结了各阶层，稳步地进行了社会改革。
    过去帝国主义及其走狗——北洋军阀、蒋介石匪帮和蒙奸德穆楚克、李守信之流，在内蒙制造蒙、汉民族间的仇恨对抗，使广大人民长期过着奴隶式的生活。
    历史上内蒙民族虽曾长期进行斗争，争取民族解放，但结果都失败了。
    只有在中国共产党和中国人民解放军的领导和帮助之下，内蒙人民组织起来了，英勇地参加了反对日本帝国主义，反对美帝国主义和国民党反动派的斗争，实行了民族区域自治，才取得了胜利。
    在蒙古民族中，曾经有人认为区域自治不能解决民族问题，不能使民族获得发展和进步，主张“独立自治”；又有人认为区域自治是对汉族自治，因而不承认自治区内的民族平等；又有人认为区域自治与民主、进步是完全无关的，因而反对在自治区内实行任何程度的民主改革，今天的事实证明，所有这些，都是错误的。
    内蒙古自治区人民政府是经过内蒙人民自己的代表大会选举的。自治区人民政府成立后，根据内蒙人民的要求，在农业区进行了土地改革，在牧业区废除了封建特权，发动了群众，同时团结了一切反对美帝国主义和国民党反动派、赞成实行民主自治的各民族各阶层人民，胜利地反对了反革命势力。经过自上而下，然后又自下而上的改造，各级政权，已经改造成为人民自己的政权。
    人民政府与广大人民的联系一年比一年密切了，自去年起，各盟、旗、县、市都召开过三次至四次各族各界人民代表会议，近二千个嘎查（行政村）政府实行了民主选举。人民代表会议的代表有工人、农民、牧民，有工商界，有妇女，有知识分子，有喇嘛，也有过去的王公。在人民代表会议上，各民族各阶层的代表，都团结一致亲密地商量着解决自己内部的问题及建设新内蒙的大事。
    根据民族区域自治原则，内蒙境内的少数民族如鄂伦春等族的聚居区域都建立了他们自己的旗或努图克（区）自治政府，在内蒙自治区人民政府统一领导下，由他们自己来管理自己的事情。在汉族特别多的地区，则实现了民族民主联合政府，如：兴安盟各旗、县、市人民代表会议一千二百七十二名代表中，蒙族代表占百分之四十七点四，汉族代表占百分之五十一点六，朝鲜族、回族代表占百分之一。呼、昭、兴三盟十四个旗、县、市的二千六百个人民代表中，蒙、汉族以外的少数民族代表占百分之三强。各民族充分享受了平等权利，各民族风俗习惯均受到尊重。
    没有蒙、汉各民族的团结合作，互相帮助，内蒙建设与发展是不可能的。
    实行区域自治、民族平等、民主改革及与美帝国主义和国民党反动派的反革命势力进行斗争的过程，也就是提高蒙古人民的爱国主义与民族觉悟的过程。
    在进行各项民主改革中，必须首先注意改造旧的武装，使之成为人民的武装。在中国共产党及中国人民解放军的领导和帮助下，我们曾积极而稳重地依靠培养进步青年，建立并加强部队中的政治工作，进行思想改造等办法改造并建立了一支内蒙人民骑兵。
    这一支内蒙人民部队，在解放战争中，配合兄弟部队打垮了国民党反动派的进攻，在内蒙境内剿灭了土匪，先后共歼敌两万二千余人，缴获战马二万二千余匹。在战斗锻炼中，从各方面向中国人民解放军学习，使自己发展壮大，成为国家统一指挥、统一制度下的中国人民解放军的一部分，现在正和内蒙公安部队及内蒙各地民兵警惕地保卫着内蒙古生产建设及地方秩序，并积极参加国家建设工作，以巩固国防。
    第二、在经济方面，迅速恢复和发展了各项生产，提高了人民生活，因而鼓舞了内蒙古劳动人民的爱国主义热情与劳动积极性，他们正在逐步地克服历史上遗留下来的落后状态。
    内蒙古民族和内蒙人民，过去长期地受着帝国主义的、封建的、官僚资本的经济剥削，解放前生产萎缩，灾荒不断，疾疫流行，土匪蜂起，人民处于饥寒交迫之中；现在翻过身来了，社会秩序安定，各项生产得到迅速恢复和发展，人民生活得到很大改善。中国共产党给内蒙广大劳动人民带来幸福的生活。
    自治区人民政府成立后，根据内蒙所存在的农业、牧业、半农半牧等不同地区情况，制订和执行了不同的发展生产的方针。在农业区实行了土地改革，各族人民都以同等权利分得了一份土地，因而农民的生产积极性空前提高了。自一九四八年以来，全内蒙展开了大规模的生产运动。过去耕作粗糙，很少施肥选种，现在全区平均施肥面积将达耕地面积的百分之三十，大部地区实行了选种及种籽消毒，防止病虫害。为了防止洪汛成灾，一九五○年人民政府动员四百二十余万民工和一部分部队建筑辽河堤，堤长达二千余华里，使受灾地由一九四九年的十三万七千垧减至一九五○年的四千多垧。由于提倡劳动互助，奖励劳动模范，扩大耕地面积，奖励精耕细作，采用新式农具，并发放农业贷款，抗旱救灾，用种种措施来增产粮食，结果内蒙粮食的产量已超过解放以前水平。以呼纳盟为例：土地改革前每垧地平均产量一千二百斤，一九五○年每垧地平均产量提高到一千六百斤至一千七百斤。今年内蒙虽然遭受了相当普遍的严重的旱灾，全区平均只有四成五的收成，但由于大部群众稍有积蓄，并在积极发展副业的情况下，我们有信心生产自救，度过灾荒。
    在牧业区废除了封建特权，实行自由放牧、增畜保畜的政策，大力提倡并推动防疫、打狼、调剂种畜、改善牧畜方法，打草、打井、搭圈棚，发放大量贷款，因而使牲畜繁殖率普遍上升。今年各地繁殖率已超过百分之七十，幼畜成活率达百分之九十以上。几年来牲畜的增加数字是可观的，一九五○年牲畜总数较一九四九年增加百分之十点七，比一九四八年增加百分之十四，而今年则可超过在去年基础上增殖百分之十一点七的计划。如果拿今年牧业区牲畜数字与一九四五年刚解放时的数字来比较，则有些地区已增加了一倍以上，新巴尔虎右旗每一个牧民已平均拥有七十头牲畜。广大牧民空前的富裕起来了，辽阔的草原上，到处呈现着欣欣向荣的新景象。
    根据全国经济发展的需要，以及当地自然条件、人民生活及生产品出路等具体情况，对于半农半牧区，今年又明确提出“禁止开荒、保护牧场”的政策。一年来的经验证明，这个政策不仅解决了这个地区的生产发展方向与步骤问题，而且可以逐步解决由于农业牧业生产在土地问题上的利益矛盾而产生的蒙汉人民间的纠纷。有的地区由于交通不便，农产粮食很难外运；有的地区，气候土质都适于牧业，当地人民感到“种一垧地不如喂一头牛”，农民兼营的牧业，在其经济生活中的比重日益增加了，因此保护牧场已逐渐成为蒙汉人民共同要求，蒙汉人民的团结互助在共同的生产生活的基础上增强起来了。
    内蒙古自治区农业牧业生产之所以得到如此迅速恢复和发展，除了实行土地改革，废除封建特权以及一系列的发展生产的政策而外，还有一条很重要的经验，就是普遍建立了为发展农业、牧业生产服务的国营贸易机构和合作社，迅速而有步骤地改变了过去严重的不等价交换，以保证农业牧业生产的发展，从而积累资金，建立工业生产。与进行土地改革的同时，我们首先曾大力建设国营贸易事业；通过国营贸易的扶助，在群众运动的基础上有步骤地普遍地组织了合作社。现在内蒙各地已普遍设立了国营贸易机构及合作社，合作社社员即将达到总人口的三分之一。这样就有力地加强了城乡物资交流，大大缩小了工、农、牧产品价格的剪刀差，基本上消灭了历史上存在的不等价交换，且使农牧矛盾变成农牧互助，有效地刺激了农业牧业生产的发展，并为建立工业提供了条件。由于上述这些，群众生活确实改善了。一九五○年群众购买力为一九四八年的百分之四百六十点四，提高了三倍多。
    中央人民政府和东北人民政府通过贸易工作帮助了内蒙各项建设，中央人民政府并在统一的财政制度之下，在财政上划给内蒙自治区以相当宽广的财政权限，这是使内蒙人民得以进行若干建设工作的重要措施。
    在中央和东北人民政府帮助下，林业生产的经营也在一年比一年进步，特别防火护林的工作，今年取得很大成绩。鄂伦春旗建立后，更有力的推动了防火工作。
    第三、积极发展文化、卫生事业。
    过去，内蒙民族和内蒙人民，在内外反动势力的统治下，被推入愚昧、迷信、疾病、灾难的深渊，被驱向毁灭的道路。自治区人民政府成立后，随着人民经济生活的提高，有步骤地发展了人民文化教育卫生事业。政府明令规定重要公文用蒙、汉两种文字，保障宗教信仰自由，提倡并宣传科学知识。在文化教育发展上，首先是整顿学校，普及教育。现在内蒙入学儿童占学龄儿童总数的百分之六十一以上，较伪满时增加了约三倍；有中学生三千八百余人。为克服蒙古人民子弟入学的困难，设置了公费生的待遇。在学制、教材等方面，已在解决发展蒙古语言文字问题。初小高小教材的全部及初中教材的一部，均已译出蒙文课本；仅一九五○年即出版了四十五种蒙文教科书，印行了三十余万册，此外还翻译了不少理论著作（主要是毛主席的著作）及通俗读物，出版了蒙文报纸，建立了蒙语广播，曾经一度发生过的忽视发展蒙古语言文字的偏向，已得到基本上纠正。
    关于卫生事业，人民政府确定“人畜两旺”的政策，在中央、东北人民政府的帮助下，经过五年来的努力，正确执行了“防重于治”、“技术和群众结合”的方针，因而有力的控制了鼠疫。例如一九四七年患鼠疫者一万七千余人，死亡一万三千多人，一九四八年患者二千多人，一九四九年患者二百余人，一九五○年至今年二月，患者共有七十七人，患病人数逐年渐少，死亡率也大大的降低了。现在能够作到一旦鼠疫发生即就地扑灭。梅毒在内蒙极为普遍，牧业区统计患者占总人口百分之六十，许多男女都不能生小孩子。自一九五○年起在呼纳盟开始了驱梅工作，现已推向锡林郭勒盟，在检查、治疗方面都有了显著成绩：据统计，有六个游牧旗已进行了普遍治疗，给三万零九百七十三人的梅毒患者作了检查，占六个旗人口总数的百分之六十九点五；给一万二千七百六十二人进行了治疗，占梅毒患者总数的百分之四十一点二。部分地区的人口已相对增加。如陈巴尔虎旗在未进行梅毒防治前，一九四五年到一九四九年的四年内，每年平均减少人口四十三人。该旗开始驱梅工作后，一九五○年一年内即增加了婴儿五十名，一九五一年一月到五月增加了三十六名。内蒙人口不仅停止了下降，而且开始增加了。在这几年防疫斗争和一年多的驱梅工作中，培养出一批蒙族卫生干部，仅在驱梅工作中就训练出七百四十六个基层卫生人员；有四个旗建立了卫生院，有二十一个苏木（区）设立了卫生所以及各级群众性的防治委员会，给内蒙古卫生医疗工作打下了基础。
    第四、由于实现了区域自治，进行了民主改革，发展了生产，就更加便利于普遍进行爱国主义教育，特别是最近一年来，结合镇压反革命运动和抗美援朝运动，使爱国主义教育更加深入到广大群众中去。内蒙人民爱祖国的热情极为高涨，不仅表现在踊跃参加和平签名和“五一”大示威，而且表现在踊跃捐献武器上。虽在灾荒情况下，内蒙捐献运动缴款竟达三百四十多亿元，超过原定计划百分之四十七，另外还有肉松三万余斤，黄羊一万二千只。
    现在各地正进一步深入抗美援朝爱国主义教育，开展增产节约运动。
    第五、大力培养干部，加强各族干部的团结。这是顺利执行中央人民政府各项政策、推动各项工作的决定关键。
    远自一九二五——一九二七年大革命时代起，中国共产党即十分注意帮助培养少数民族干部，抗战中在延安开办民族学院等学校，更大力培养民族干部，其中包括很多蒙古族干部。而在抗日战争胜利后，又开办了内蒙军政学院、自治学院等学校。自治区人民政府成立后，又举办了内蒙军政大学、行政干部学校，以及卫生干部学校、合作干部训练班、兽疫训练班、会计训练班等，以培养各种工作干部，并先后送到外区进大学及专科学校学习者有四百八十五名。一九五○年又开办了工农速成中学及工农文化补习学校，以提高蒙汉干部的文化水平。就这样经过学校训练，以及工作中的培养，几年来内蒙共培养了各民族脱离生产的干部两万五千余人。其中蒙族占一万一千多人。这是内蒙自治区推动、完成各项工作的重要保障，他们不仅作一般工作，而且有一批已担任指导工作。在自治区人民政府十八名委员中蒙族委员占十五名，三十一名正副部长、局长中，蒙古族干部占十七名。六个盟十二名正副盟长中蒙族干部占七名，有四十三名蒙族干部担任着正副旗长的职务，其他党的机关、政府、群众团体、邮电、税务、林业、贸易、金融、文化机关都有大批蒙族干部担任工作。
    经验证明：蒙古青年知识分子，是迫切要求自己民族解放的，而且易于接受进步思想。但由于历史上大汉族主义对少数民族的压迫极其残酷，少数民族（蒙古民族也一样）对大民族就容易有不信任心理及狭隘民族主义思想，最初他们往往从民族立场出发，表现阶级立场模糊，他们拥护共产党也是从
    “民族立场”出发。这就必须十分耐心的进行教育，使他们在实际斗争中取得锻炼并提高觉悟，逐渐与工农群众相结合，得到改造。实际证明他们是能够改造的。数年来，经过深入的民族政策教育以后，又经过反对本民族内部的勾结美帝国主义和国民党反动派人民公敌的斗争及土地改革运动，蒙族干部大部已能从阶级立场出发来看民族问题了，他们的国际主义觉悟提高了，爱国主义的觉悟也提高了，因而狭隘民族主义也逐步得到了克服。比如他们过去对汉族工作干部是有怀疑的，现在他们亲身体验到汉民族帮助的重要了，他们欢迎汉族干部为内蒙人民服务，他们大部已是被毛泽东思想所武装起来的民族的和国家的干部了。
    经验也同时证明：开展少数民族地区的工作，包括培养少数民族干部的工作在内，必须有一批质量适当的老干部作骨干，这在开始建立工作时尤其必要。由于老干部多是汉族干部，他们开始到内蒙工作时，有的同志不免有大民族优越感，容易看不起或不相信蒙古干部，觉得蒙古新干部未经过考验，因之不善于采取遇事虚心商量和耐心帮助的态度，往往有包办代替的作风。此外，有的同志也不免有
    “作客思想”，不作长期打算，在工作上容易犯
    “急躁”“搬套”毛病，不能专心一意研究蒙古情况，也不愿学习蒙古语言文字，不能细致体会蒙古同志的心理感情，因此就不能积极沟通与蒙古同志的关系。对于这些同志，领导上必须耐心地说服他们，帮助他们总结经验，去掉“作客”思想，一心一意为少数民族人民服务，注意民族形式，深刻体会蒙古群众感情，研究分析内蒙的社会情况，耐心帮助蒙古同志，并向蒙古同志虚心学习，以便把工作做好。这是一个艰苦工作，但是在中国共产党的教育下，现在他们已经和广大内蒙人民有了深厚的感情，专心一意的在自治区工作了。
    加强蒙、汉干部团结，是蒙、汉人民团结的关键。对这一工作，我们是经常加以注意的。在自治区采取了批评和自我批评的方法，教育蒙族人民，尤其是蒙族干部克服和防止狭隘民族主义倾向；同时教育汉族人民，尤其是汉族干部，从各方面切实尊重少数民族的平等权利，尊重少数民族人民的意见，消除大民族主义倾向。
    从上述这些事实，可以充分看到：内蒙人民是解放了，不仅在政治上享受了民族的平等权利，而且在自己内部也进行了一系列适当的社会改革，从而使自己各方面的建设得到迅速发展，巩固了各民族之间兄弟般的新关系。
    内蒙人民充分了解：只有在中国共产党领导之下，只有在内蒙人民自己组织起来当家作主的条件之下，才能得到这一切好处。所以，内蒙各民族人民越来越爱戴毛主席，越来越信任和拥护中央人民政府，民族觉悟和人民建设的积极性越来越高。这就充分证明了，实行民族区域自治的确是解决中国国内民族问题的最适宜最合理的政策，是推动民族地区各项工作的中心环节，是通过民族形式实现新民主主义各项政策的重大措施。
    内蒙古民族充分了解：蒙古民族在政治、经济、文化各方面的发展，必须有自治区内汉族的合作，有全国汉族人民的伟大帮助。汉族是中国民族大家庭中的主体民族，它与中国其他民族来比较是先进的民族，和汉族及中国各民族团结合作，并争取他们的帮助是内蒙古民族顺利地向前发展的重要条件。
    内蒙古自治区几年来在毛主席、中国共产党、中央人民政府领导下，在内蒙古蒙、汉人民和蒙、汉干部共同努力下，工作上取得了一定的成就。但是，由于干部特别是领导干部工作经验缺乏，政策水平不高，曾经也犯了若干错误，发生了不少缺点。相信今后在毛主席、中国共产党、中央人民政府正确领导下，经过蒙汉人民和干部的积极努力，工作一定能够更向前迈进，做出更多的成绩。
    我简单地介绍了内蒙情况，希望到会的委员及代表同志们予以批评指正。
    中华人民共和国各民族团结万岁！
    中国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
