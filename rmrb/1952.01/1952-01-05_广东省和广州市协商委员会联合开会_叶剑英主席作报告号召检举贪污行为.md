Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 3rd: Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City will, in 1952, increase production and practice economy to the tune of 7,000 billion yuan for the country, and at the same time strive to increase grain production by 1.5 billion jin, based on the fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. This was announced by Ye Jianying, Chairman of Guangdong Province and Mayor of Guangzhou City, at the joint meeting of all members of the Second Guangdong Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee and the Fourth Guangzhou Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, held from December 21st to 29th.

Ye Jianying delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Increase Production and Practice Economy on the Basis of Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy." Ye Jianying said: We must resolutely punish corrupt officials, and at the same time, combine this with the "Five Loves" education stipulated in the Common Program to effectively overcome the phenomenon of corruption. People's governments at all levels and people's organizations must cooperate closely to vigorously expose corrupt behavior and create an atmosphere of moral resistance and hatred towards corrupt elements among all cadres and the masses. Ye Jianying pointed out: In order to vigorously and thoroughly oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, leading cadres must take responsibility, take action personally, mobilize the masses, and promote democracy. We must reward model units and individuals, drawing a clear line between these units and individuals and those who are corrupt, wasteful, and bureaucratic. Ye Jianying particularly pointed out: The current extremely chaotic phenomenon in various regions where township governments arbitrarily add to the public grain quota, stipulate tax items, arbitrarily apportion expenses, and collect and spend money indiscriminately, seriously damages the relationship between the government and the people. It is imperative to take the rectification of local finances to reduce the burden on the masses and increase state revenue as an important link in implementing the movement to increase production, practice economy, and oppose corruption and waste.

After discussion, all attending representatives unanimously agreed with Ye Jianying's report. In his summary, Ye Jianying emphasized: It is necessary to combine the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, increasing production and practicing economy, with other tasks such as land reform in rural areas, democratic reform in cities, ideological education for cadres, and improving the efficiency of organizational work. Grasp the time and complete the urgent and arduous tasks.

    广东省和广州市协商委员会联合开会
    叶剑英主席作报告号召检举贪污行为
    【新华社广州三日电】广东省和广州市一九五二年将在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的基础上，为国家增产节约七千亿元，同时争取增产粮食十五亿斤。这是广东省主席兼广州市市长叶剑英在十二月二十一日到二十九日举行的广东省第二届各界人民代表会议协商委员会和广州市第四届各界人民代表会议协商委员会全体委员联合会议上宣布的。
    叶剑英在会议上做了“在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的基础上，厉行节约，增加生产”的报告。叶剑英说：我们必须坚决惩治贪污犯，同时要结合进行共同纲领中规定的“五爱”教育，有效地克服贪污现象。各级人民政府、各界人民团体必须通力合作，大张旗鼓地检举贪污行为，并在全体干部和群众中造成对贪污分子的道德的抵制和憎恨的气氛。叶剑英指出：为着有力地、彻底地反对贪污浪费和官僚主义，必须首长负责，亲自动手，发动群众，发扬民主。必须奖励模范的单位和人物，从这些单位和人物与那些贪污者、浪费者和官僚主义者之间，划出明显的界限来。叶剑英特别指出：目前各地区乡政府擅自附加公粮，规定税目，任意摊派，乱收乱支的极端混乱现象，严重地损害了政府和人民群众的联系，必须把整理地方财政以减轻群众负担、增加国家收入作为贯彻增产节约和反对贪污浪费运动的重要一环。
    全体出席代表在经过讨论以后，一致同意叶剑英的报告。叶剑英在总结时强调指出：必须使反对贪污、浪费和官僚主义，增加生产，厉行节约的运动和其他任务如农村的土地改革工作、城市的民主改革工作、提高干部的思想教育工作、提高业务效率的机关工作结合起来，抓紧时间，完成紧迫而繁重的任务。
