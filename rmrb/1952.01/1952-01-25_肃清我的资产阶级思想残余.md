    Purge My Remaining Bourgeois Ideology
    Comrade Editor: After participating in the Central Public Security Department's rally to struggle against the major embezzlers Song Degui and Liu Yuze, I realized how insidiously the bourgeoisie uses despicable and shameless means to attack us. I joined the revolution not long ago and my awareness is not high, and I also come from a bourgeois background. Therefore, I feel that I should be more vigilant and thoroughly transform my thinking, otherwise it will be difficult to resist the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets.
    After attending this conference, I realized that I have not seriously purged my remaining bourgeois bad thoughts and bad work styles, and instead brought these bad thoughts and bad work styles into the revolutionary ranks. For example, I still have a lack of restraint in my life, like to spend money casually, and indulge in gluttony and fine clothes - the "young lady style" of the bourgeoisie. In this great movement, I must seriously and thoroughly examine myself, resolutely fight against my bad thoughts and bad work styles, and thoroughly eliminate the remaining bourgeois ideology in myself.

    肃清我的资产阶级思想残余
    编辑同志：参加了中央公安部斗争大贪污犯宋德贵、刘玉泽的大会后，认识了资产阶级是如何阴毒地用卑鄙无耻的手段向我们进攻。我参加革命不久，觉悟不高，又出身于资产阶级。因之，我感到自己应该更提高警惕，彻底地改造思想，不然就很难抵抗资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻。
    参加这次大会后，我想到我还没有认真地肃清自己残存的资产阶级的坏思想、坏作风，反而把这些坏思想、坏作风带到革命队伍中来。比如，我还有生活不检点，爱随便花钱，贪吃贪穿等资产阶级的“小姐作风”。在这次伟大的运动中，我一定要认真、彻底地检查自己，坚决向我的坏思想、坏作风进行斗争，彻底肃清自己身上的资产阶级思想残余。
