    The Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau has awarded bonuses to the authors of two serial cartoon books, "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party" and "From Head to Tail," to reward authors of outstanding popular literature and art.
    "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party" is a popular picture book created by Zhao Fengchuan, Gu Yizhou, Wu Jingbo, and others. This serial cartoon vividly and systematically presents the thirty-year struggle history of the Chinese Communist Party. Because this serial cartoon meets the needs of the broad masses in learning Party history, more than 4.5 million copies have been printed as stand-alone books or reprinted in local publications to date.
    "From Head to Tail" is a serial cartoon created by Tian Zuoliang, with the theme of exposing the crimes of the Yiguandao sect. This serial cartoon played a certain role in educating the masses and promoting the movement to ban reactionary secret societies.
    Both of these works closely coordinated with the major political tasks of the time and were therefore welcomed by the broad masses. In order to promote the vigorous creation of such popular literary and artistic works by literary and art workers to meet the cultural needs of workers and peasants, the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau decided to award the authors of "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party" a bonus of three million yuan and the author of "From Head to Tail" a bonus of one million yuan.

    中共中央华北局宣传部奖励优秀的连环画作者
    中共中央华北局宣传部为奖励优秀的通俗文艺作品的作者，特发给“中国共产党三十年连环画”和“从头看尾”等两部连环画的作者以奖金。
    “中国共产党三十年连环画”是赵枫川、古一舟、吴静波等所作的一部通俗画册。这一部连环画简明生动而有系统地表现了中国共产党三十年的奋斗历史。这部连环画因适合广大人民学习党史的要求，到现在为止，印成单行本或经各地刊物转载的共达四百五十多万份。
    “从头看尾”是田作良作的连环画，以揭露一贯道罪行为主题。这部连环画在教育群众、推动取缔反动会道门的运动上起了一定的作用。
    这两部作品都紧密地配合了当时的重大政治任务，因此受到广大群众的欢迎。为了推动文艺工作者大力创作这类通俗文艺作品，以满足工农群众的文化要求，中共中央华北局宣传部决定发给“中国共产党三十年连环画”的作者奖金三百万元，发给“从头看尾”的作者奖金一百万元。            （新华社）
