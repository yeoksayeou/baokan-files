Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th: Our correspondent reports: The American side blatantly used the POW information exchanged at the armistice negotiation table to dispatch aerial bandits to frantically bomb our army's POW camp in Lishi Village, Shengpai Township, Jiangdong County.

On the evening of January 14th, at 9 PM, an American twin-engine bomber suddenly flew from the south over the Jiangdong POW camp and, without circling, dropped seven 50-kilogram bombs on the POW dormitory, destroying eight POW camp dormitory buildings, a total of 72 rooms. The Rhee Syngman puppet army POWs in the dormitories were preparing to go to bed and had no time to escape. Fifteen were killed on the spot, twelve were seriously injured, and fifty-two were lightly injured. One People's Army guard also died on the spot. After dropping the bombs, the American plane circled over the POW camp for more than 40 minutes before flying south.

Our medical personnel in the POW camp, in line with their consistent humanitarian spirit, together with the guards and uninjured POWs, risked their lives to rescue the wounded, carrying all the wounded to air-raid shelters overnight to bandage their wounds and take care of them properly.

On the 15th, twelve people, including our agency's reporters and reporters from various news agencies here, jointly went to the scene to investigate and took photos of the dead and wounded POWs as ironclad evidence of the American aggressor bandits' bestial atrocities.

Fifteen Rhee Syngman puppet army POWs residing in the No. 1 dormitory of the 4th Company of the POW camp were all killed. Flesh and blood flew everywhere. Some were decapitated, some had their limbs blown off, and some had their abdomens shattered. The POW camp authorities have collected the corpses and buried them on the 15th. The list of the dead is as follows: People's Army guard Park Yun-seop, POW Park Young-bok, Deputy Commander of the 8th Regiment of the 7th Division of the Rhee puppet army; Kang Gyu-hyeon, squad leader of the 7th Regiment of the 6th Division; Kim Kwon-cheol, Sergeant of the Rhee puppet army Capital Division; Sergeant Heo Kwon; Corporal Song Man-do; Kim Ha-yeong, Sergeant of the 16th Regiment of the 8th Division; Kim Seung-gi, Corporal of the Medical Team of the 2nd Regiment of the 6th Division; Lee Gwang-sik, Private First Class of the Tank Unit of the 9th Division; Kim Cheol-su, Private First Class of the 7th Division; Yang Seong-bok, Private First Class of the 3rd Battalion of the 7th Regiment of the 8th Division; Kim Bong-han, Private First Class of the Mechanized Unit of the Capital Division; Kim Gi-seok, Private First Class of the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment of the 3rd Division; Kim Woo-seok, Private Second Class of the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Regiment of the 7th Division; Park Young-gi, Private Second Class of the 2nd Battalion of the 6th Regiment of the 8th Division; Kwon Man-seop, Private Second Class of the 3rd Battalion of the 8th Regiment of the 3rd Division.

According to Choi Il-rok, the person in charge of our army's POW camp: "The Jiangdong POW camp is located in a mountain valley and has never been discovered by enemy planes. Before the two sides exchanged POW information, it had never been bombed by enemy planes. This bombing is obviously a brutal act intentionally carried out by the American side based on the information provided by our side regarding the location of the POW camp. Their shameless attempt is undoubtedly to create obstacles in the armistice negotiations in order to continue to delay the negotiations and create excuses to slander our side for abusing and killing POWs. However, the evidence is conclusive, and the American side's despicable means cannot cover up the eyes and ears of fair-minded people around the world."

All the POWs also unanimously accused and protested to the reporters about the criminal acts of the American aggressors. POWs Wu Kang-jun (soldier of the 9th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 18th Regiment of the Rhee puppet army 9th Division), Huang Yong-de (soldier of the 5th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 32nd Regiment of the Rhee puppet army), Li Xi-dou (member of the medical team of the 9th Regiment of the 2nd Division of the Rhee puppet army) and more than 300 others wrote in their collective protest letter:

"After we were captured, we were all treated kindly by the Republic government. We ate well and dressed well in the POW camp, and began to live a peaceful and happy life. But on the evening of January 14, American aerial bandits frantically bombed our dormitories, killing and wounding 79 of us. There are no military targets here. This is the first bombing of us by American planes. This proves that the Americans want to create new obstacles, continue to delay the armistice negotiations, and prevent us from returning home to reunite with our families as soon as possible."

We want to lodge a serious protest against this atrocity by American aerial bandits and demand that the peace-loving people of the world sanction this atrocity. The bestial atrocities of the American aggressor bandits once again demonstrate that the restoration and construction of airport facilities in North Korea is our sacred right of self-defense and must not be interfered with by the American side.

    我军江东战俘营全体战俘
    抗议美机轰炸战俘营
    要求世界人民制裁美国暴行
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】本社记者报道：美方公然利用双方在停战谈判会议桌上交换的有关战俘资料，派遣空中强盗疯狂轰炸江东郡胜派面立石里的我军战俘营。
    一月十四日晚九时美国双引擎轰炸机一架，突然自南飞来江东战俘营上空，未经盘旋即向战俘宿舍投下五十公斤重的炸弹七颗，炸毁战俘营宿舍房屋八所，共计七十二间。宿舍里的李承晚伪军战俘正准备入寝，来不及躲避，当场被炸死十五名，重伤战俘十二名，轻伤五十二名，人民军警卫队员一人亦当场牺牲。美机投弹后复在战俘营上空盘旋四十多分钟，然后向南方飞去。
    战俘营的我方医护人员本着一贯的人道主义精神，和警卫队员以及未遭伤害的战俘们一起冒险抢救伤号，连夜把全部伤号抬到防空壕里包扎伤口，妥为照料。
    十五日本社记者和此间各新闻机关的记者等十二人，联合前往现场调查，并为死伤战俘拍照，作为美国侵略强盗野兽暴行的铁证。
    居住在战俘营第四中队第一号宿舍的李承晚伪军战俘十五名全部被炸死，血肉横飞，有的炸掉了头，有的炸断四肢，有的炸碎腹部。战俘营当局已在十五日将死尸收殡埋葬。死者的名单如下：人民军警备队员朴润燮，战俘李伪军七师八联队副联队长朴永福，六师七联队小队长姜圭现，李伪军首都师中士金权铁，中士许权，下士宋万道，八师十六联队中士金夏永，六师二联队医务队下士金胜基，九师坦克部队一等兵李光植，七师一等兵金喆寿，八师七联队三大队一等兵杨圣福，首都师机甲部队一等兵金奉汉，三师二十三联队一大队一等兵金基石，七师八联队二大队二等兵金右石，八师六联队二大队二等兵朴荣基，三师八联队三大队二等兵权满燮。
    据我军战俘营负责人崔日录说：“江东战俘营设在山沟里一向没有被敌机发现，在谈判双方未交换有关战俘资料以前，从未遭遇敌机轰炸，这次轰炸显然是美方根据我方所提供的战俘营所在地的资料，有意制造的暴行，其无耻企图无疑是使停战谈判横生枝节，以便继续拖延谈判并制造借口诬蔑我方虐杀战俘。但是，证据确凿，美方的卑鄙手段是无法掩盖全世界公正人士的耳目的。
    所有战俘也一致向记者们控诉与抗议美国侵略者的罪恶行为，战俘吴亢俊（李伪军九师十八联队三大队九中队士兵）黄永德（李伪军三十二联队三大队五中队士兵）李锡斗（李伪军二师九联队医疗队队员）等三百余人在他们的集体抗议书中写道：
    “我们在被俘以后，都受到共和国政府的宽待，我们在俘虏营吃得好，穿得也好，开始过着和平幸福的生活。但美国空中强盗却在一月十四日晚，疯狂轰炸了我们的宿舍，使我们死伤了七十九人。我们这里没有任何军事目标，这是美机对我们的第一次轰炸，这证明美国人是要制造新的障碍，继续拖延停战谈判，使我们不能早日回家和家人团聚。”
    我们要对美国空中强盗这种暴行提出严重抗议，并要求全世界爱好和平的人民，对这种暴行加以制裁。美国侵略强盗的野兽暴行，又一次说明了恢复与修建朝鲜境内机场设备，是我方神圣的自卫权利，绝不容许美方干涉。
