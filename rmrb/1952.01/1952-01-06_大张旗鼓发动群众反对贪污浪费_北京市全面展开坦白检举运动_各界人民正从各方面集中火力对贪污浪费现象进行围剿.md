Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Beijing has comprehensively mobilized the masses and launched a confession and exposure campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. This movement is being carried out from two aspects: mobilizing all机关 staff and mobilizing all the people. At the beginning of this movement Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of the People's Government of Beijing, personally made several mobilization reports at the cadres' meetings inside and outside the Party and at the Municipal People's Congress. He repeatedly explained the great significance of launching this movement on a large scale and called on the heads of all units to take the lead in mobilizing the masses. All units have successively established economy inspection committees, including responsible cadres and activists from inside and outside the Party, to lead this movement. Before and after the Municipal People's Congress, most机关 groups and industrial and mining enterprises held two or three mobilization meetings, where responsible cadres of the unit made mobilization reports, explained policies, and called on those who had engaged in corruption and waste to confess and examine themselves. Some responsible cadres who did not pay attention to this movement were criticized and educated. Corrupt elements who refused to confess and suppressed exposure were subjected to disciplinary sanctions. Some responsible cadres who had engaged in corruption and waste took the lead in making confessions and self-criticisms, which promoted the confession of those in their units who had also engaged in corruption and waste. After more than ten days of mobilization and preparation, all机关 groups and industrial and mining enterprises universally launched a confession movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Many people who have engaged in corruption and waste have begun to confess. A large number of corruption and waste phenomena have been exposed. For example, more than 900 people in the units under the Beijing Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau have confessed, and at the same time, they have exposed many illegal industrialists and businessmen who have bribed and evaded taxes. In order to further deepen the confession and exposure movement against corruption and waste, all机关 groups and industrial and mining enterprises are currently holding anti-corruption struggle meetings to deal with those who have genuinely confessed and corrupt elements who have refused to confess, depending on the severity of the case and the extent of their confession, and to warn corrupt elements that they must thoroughly confess. Units that have held anti-corruption struggle meetings have seen the confession movement develop more deeply. For example, after the Tianjin Railway Administration Beijing Branch held an anti-corruption struggle meeting on the 4th, some corrupt elements who had not confessed thoroughly immediately supplemented their materials.

In terms of mobilizing the people from all walks of life to carry out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, organizations such as the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation began to convene representative meetings and symposiums of shop assistants, youth, and housewives in various districts before the Municipal People's Congress to mobilize the masses to expose corrupt elements. After the Municipal People's Congress, all people's organizations immediately implemented the "Resolution on Further Developing the Increase Production and Practice Economy and Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement in the City" of the Municipal People's Congress. Various mass meetings, representative meetings, and symposiums were widely held in factories, streets, and suburban rural areas to mobilize organized masses from all aspects to carry out this movement. Currently, people's representative meetings are being held in various districts to mobilize people from all walks of life to expose corrupt elements. The mass exposure movement is developing rapidly. In the past few days, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Democratic Youth, and the Beijing Municipal Shop Employees' Union have held symposiums, representative meetings, and mass meetings of youth and shop employees in various districts. More than 25,000 young people and shop employees participated. More than 200 corruption cases have been exposed. The Economy Inspection Committee of the Ninth District of Beijing convened two mobilization meetings of citizen activists and relied on street citizen activists to carry out propaganda, so that citizens in all households in the district had a preliminary understanding of this movement. Currently, the exposure movement is being widely carried out among citizens.

The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a mobilization meeting of representatives from various industry guilds before the Municipal People's Congress, calling on the city's industrial and commercial circles to carry out an anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement. During and after the Municipal People's Congress, industry guilds and district industrial and commercial federations universally and deeply mobilized those industrial and commercial households who had engaged in bribery, tax evasion, and illegally obtaining state property to confess, launching an anti-corruption and anti-bribery confession movement in the industrial and commercial circles. Many industrial and commercial households in fifteen industries, such as construction, ironwork, electrical materials, stationery, woodwork, grain, and radio, have confessed. For example, the Construction Industry Guild held two mobilization meetings successively. After mobilization, 107 construction factories confessed and handed over bribery materials.

Currently, people from all walks of life in Beijing are concentrating firepower from all aspects to launch a larger-scale mass confession and exposure movement to besiege corruption and waste.

    大张旗鼓发动群众反对贪污浪费
    北京市全面展开坦白检举运动
    各界人民正从各方面集中火力对贪污浪费现象进行围剿
    【新华社五日讯】北京市全面发动群众，展开了反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的坦白检举运动。这个运动是从动员全体机关工作人员和发动全体人民群众两方面开展起来的。在这个运动开始时，中国共产党北京市委员会书记、北京市人民政府市长彭真亲自在党内外的干部大会和市人民代表会议上接连作了几次动员报告，反复说明必须发动群众大张旗鼓进行这个运动的重大意义，号召各单位首长亲自动手，发动群众。各单位先后成立了包括党内外负责干部和积极分子的节约检查委员会来领导这一运动。在市人民代表会议开会前后，大部分机关团体和工矿企业举行了两三次动员大会，由本单位负责干部作动员报告，说明政策，号召有贪污浪费行为的人自己坦白、检讨。一些不重视这个运动的负责干部都受到了批评和教育。拒不坦白和压制检举的贪污分子受到了纪律的制裁。有些有贪污浪费行为的负责干部带头进行了坦白检讨，推动了本单位有贪污浪费行为的人也进行了坦白。经过了十多天的动员和酝酿，各机关团体和工矿企业普遍展开了反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的坦白运动。很多有贪污浪费行为的人已开始坦白交代。贪污浪费现象已被大量的揭露出来。如北京市人民政府税务局所属各单位已有九百多人进行坦白交代，同时检举出很多不法工商业者行贿漏税的行为。各机关团体和工矿企业为了进一步深入开展反对贪污浪费的坦白检举运动，目前正在举行反贪污斗争大会，根据案情的轻重和坦白的程度分别处理了一些真正坦白的人和拒不坦白的贪污分子，警告贪污分子必须彻底坦白。开过了反贪污斗争大会的单位，坦白运动都更深入地开展起来了。如天津铁路管理局北京分局在四日开过反贪污斗争大会后，有些坦白不彻底的贪污分子马上补充了自己的材料。
    在动员各界人民群众开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动方面，北京市总工会、青年团北京市委员会和北京市民主妇女联合会等团体，在市人民代表会议开会之前，即开始在各区召开店员、青年、家庭妇女的代表会议和座谈会，动员群众检举贪污分子。市人民代表会议开过后，各人民团体立即执行市人民代表会议“关于在全市进一步开展增产节约和反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的决议”，在各工厂、街道和郊区农村中普遍召开各种群众大会、代表会和座谈会，动员各方面有组织的群众开展这个运动。目前各区正在举行人民代表会议，动员各界人民检举贪污分子。群众性的检举运动正在迅速开展。最近几天内，青年团北京市委员会、北京市民主青年联合会和北京市店员工会在各区举行青年、店员的座谈会、代表会和群众大会。参加的青年和店员有二万五千多人。检举出来的贪污案有二百多件。北京市第九区节约检查委员会召开了两次市民积极分子动员大会，并依靠各街道市民积极分子进行宣传，使全区各户市民都对这个运动有了初步的认识。目前检举运动正在市民中广泛开展。
    北京市工商联合会在市人民代表会议开会之前，即召集各行业公会代表举行动员大会，号召全市工商界开展反贪污反行贿运动。在市人民代表会议开会期间和会后，各行业公会和各区工商联办事处普遍深入地动员各工商业户中有行贿漏税和非法骗取国家财物的人进行坦白，展开了工商界的反贪污反行贿坦白运动。营造、铁工、电料、文具、木器、粮食、无线电等十五个行业都有很多工商户进行了坦白。如营造业公会先后举行了两次动员大会，经过动员即有一百零七家营造厂坦白，交出行贿材料。
    目前，北京市各界人民正在从各方面集中火力，展开规模更大的群众性的坦白、检举运动，对贪污浪费现象进行围剿。
