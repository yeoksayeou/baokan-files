Chang Xiangyu Strives to Donate an Airplane Soon and is Willing to Thoroughly Remold her Ideology

Comrade Editor: The year 1951 was a year of great victories for the Chinese people in resisting America and aiding Korea. The motherland's construction cause is progressing rapidly, the lives of the broad masses of people are constantly improving, and life is becoming happier day by day.

In the past, under the rule and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, I lived a painful life of a beast of burden. After liberation, the Communist Party led us artists to turn over, I was completely liberated, and received education and training. I was selected as a member of the Northwest Anti-American Aid Korea General Branch, and participated in political and cultural activities. My political status has greatly improved. I was illiterate before liberation. After liberation, the People's Government helped me to learn culture. In the past year, I have learned to write a diary. In terms of performing, I further realized the correctness of Chairman Mao's line on literature and art. I understood for whom to perform, what to perform, how to perform; whom to love, whom to hate, what to express, and what to expose. Based on these experiences, I performed "New Mulan," "Shao Qiaoyun," "The Legend of the White Snake," etc., which were very popular among the masses. I also felt that due to my efforts in political and cultural studies in 1951, my performance work has greatly improved.

I increasingly feel the warmth and happiness of living in the Mao Zedong era, and feel the glory of being a master of the new China. I deeply love my country. I have confidence in my work, and feel that the more I do, the more promising it is. When the Anti-American Aid Korea General Association called for donations of weapons, I and our troupe decided to perform in major cities across the country and donate a "Xiangyu Troupe" airplane. On August 7th last year, we set off from Xi'an to Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Hankou, Wuchang, and Guangzhou to hold donation performances. In more than four months, we completed a donation figure of over 1 billion. These achievements should be entirely attributed to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people. During performances in various places, many people enthusiastically supported us. The Zhongnan Jingju [Peking Opera] Troupe responded to us by donating a "Zhongnan Jingju" airplane. From these moving facts, I deeply realized that the people of the new China are truly masters of their own affairs. They love the Communist Party, love the motherland, and love the people of the motherland.

Under such education and encouragement, I want to use the practical action of striving to complete the donation of 1.2 billion yuan this New Year's Day to celebrate and offer a gift to Chairman Mao and the new China. In 1952, I guarantee to redouble my efforts to complete the donation task of the "Xiangyu Troupe" airplane as soon as possible, and strive to completely defeat the aggression of American imperialism; and I guarantee to follow Chairman Mao's instructions to thoroughly transform my ideology and be a good people's actor in the new China.
Chang Xiangyu

Editor's Note: Chang Xiangyu, a famous actor of Henan Bangzi Opera, and the "Xiangyu Troupe" she leads, tour major cities across the country for benefit performances, planning to use the income from the benefit performances to donate a "Xiangyu Troupe" fighter plane. They have now completed donations of more than 1.236 billion yuan. Their patriotic actions have won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people in the Central South region, and have promoted the donation movement in the Central South opera circles.

    常香玉争取早日捐献飞机一架并愿彻底进行思想改造
    编辑同志：一九五一年是中国人民抗美援朝获得伟大胜利的一年。祖国的建设事业一日千里地进展着，广大人民的生活正在不断改善，生活一天比一天幸福。
    我过去在国民党反动派的统治压迫下，过着痛苦的牛马生活。解放后，共产党领导我们艺人翻了身，我彻底得到了解放，受到了教育和培养。我由一个被旧社会歧视的艺人，被选为西北抗美援朝总分会委员，参加了政治文化活动，我的政治地位大大提高了。我在解放前不识字，解放后人民政府帮助我学文化，在去年一年中我已经学会写日记了。在演戏方面，我进一步地体会到毛主席文艺路线的正确，我明白了为谁演戏，演什么戏，怎样演戏；爱什么人，恨什么人，表现什么和暴露什么。根据这些体会，我演出了“新花木兰”“邵巧云”“白蛇传”等，很受群众欢迎。我也感觉到由于一九五一年我在政治和文化学习上的努力，在演出工作上有了很大提高。
    我愈来愈感觉到生活在毛泽东时代的温暖和幸福，感觉到作一个新中国主人的光荣，我深爱自己的祖国。我对自己的工作有了信心，觉着愈干愈有前途。当抗美援朝总会号召捐献武器的时候，我便和我们剧社决定到全国各大城市演出，捐献
    “香玉剧社号”飞机一架。去年八月七日从西安出发，到开封、郑州、新乡、汉口、武昌、广州举行捐献演出，在四个多月中便完成十亿以上的捐献数字。这些成绩完全应该归功于中国共产党的正确领导和广大人民的热烈支持。在各地演出时，许多群众热烈支援我们。中南京剧工作团拿捐献“中南京剧号”飞机一架来响应我们。从这些动人的事实中，我深深地体会到新中国人民是真正当家作主了，他们热爱共产党，热爱祖国，热爱祖国的人民。
    在这样的教育和鼓舞下，我要在今年元旦，以争取完成捐献十二亿元的实际行动，来作为向毛主席和新中国的祝贺和献礼。在一九五二年，我保证加倍努力，把“香玉剧社号”飞机捐献任务早日完成，为彻底打垮美帝国主义的侵略而努力；并保证遵照毛主席的指示，把自己的思想加以彻底改造，作一个新中国的好的人民演员。常香玉
    编者按：河南梆子戏著名演员常香玉和她所领导的“香玉剧社”，到全国各大城市巡回义演，计划用义演收入，捐献“香玉剧社号”战斗机一架。她们现已完成捐献款数十二亿三千六百多万元。她们的爱国行动，获得了中南区广大群众的热烈支持，并推动了中南戏曲界的捐献运动。
