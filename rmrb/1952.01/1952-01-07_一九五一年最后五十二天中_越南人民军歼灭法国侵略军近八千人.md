    In the last fifty-two days of 1951, the Vietnamese People's Army achieved a brilliant victory by killing and capturing nearly eight thousand enemy soldiers. According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam: The General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army issued a communique on the battle achievements in North Vietnam from November 10 to December 31, 1951. The communique pointed out that the French invaders expanded the war to the Hoa Binh province area southwest of Hanoi, creating a good opportunity for the Vietnamese People's Army to annihilate the main force of the French army and develop guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. In this period of less than two months, the Vietnamese People's Army conducted seventy-one battles in North Vietnam, killing 6,637 enemy officers and soldiers, including two majors, and capturing 1,319 enemy officers and soldiers. Therefore, the enemy's total losses reached 7,956, not including the number of enemy wounded.
    In these battles, the Vietnamese People's Army removed thirty-three enemy strongholds, including several strongholds where the enemy was equipped with a company, two companies, or even a battalion of garrison troops and had new fortifications.
    The People's Army destroyed nine enemy tanks, sixteen armored vehicles, one hundred and eleven trucks, more than ten artillery pieces of various calibers, and thirteen military warehouses, and seized a large number of enemy weapons and military supplies.
    The communique said that inspired by these glorious victories, the Vietnamese People's Army and people are enthusiastically engaging in a meritorious competition as a gift to President Ho Chi Minh and as a gift for the upcoming All-Vietnam Combat Heroes Conference.
    These victories of the Vietnamese People's Army have further demoralized the enemy. On the Hoa Binh and Black River battlefronts, many units of the enemy—some with more than forty people—have surrendered to the People's Army with their weapons. In the central region and the Red River Delta battlefronts, many enemy soldiers have also surrendered to the People's Army. In Phu Ly, the provincial capital south of Hanoi, there was recently an incident in which enemy reinforcements refused to go to the front and demanded to return home.

    一九五一年最后五十二天中
    越南人民军歼灭法国侵略军近八千人
    【新华社六日讯】越南人民军在去年的最后五十二天中，取得了击毙和俘掳敌军将近八千人的光辉胜利。据越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军总司令部发表了自一九五一年十一月十日到十二月三十一日北越的战绩公报。公报指出：法国侵略者把战争扩大到河内西南的和平省地区，给越南人民军制造了歼灭法军主力和在敌后发展游击战的良好机会。在这个不到两个月的期间，越南人民军在北越进行了七十一次战斗，击毙敌军官兵六千六百三十七人，其中包括少校二人；俘掳敌军官兵一千三百十九人。因此敌人的损失共达七千九百五十六人，敌军受伤人数还没有计算在内。
    越南人民军在这些战斗中，拔除了敌军据点三十三处，其中包括敌军配备了一个连、两个连以至一个营的守备兵力和设有新的防御工事的据点数处。
    人民军击毁敌军坦克九辆、装甲车十六辆、卡车一百十一辆、各种口径的大炮十多门以及军事仓库十三处，缴获敌军大量武器和军需品。
    公报说：越南人民军和人民在这些光辉胜利的鼓舞下，正在热情地进行立功竞赛，作为献给胡志明主席的礼物以及对于即将举行的全越战斗英雄会议的献礼。
    越南人民军的这些胜利已使敌军士气更加衰落。在和平与黑水江战线上，许多股的敌军——有的在四十人以上——都携武器向人民军投诚。在中部地区和红河三角洲战线上，也有许多敌军向人民军投降。在河内以南的府里的省会，最近曾发生敌人援军拒绝开赴前线并且要求回家的事件。
