The rectification study of various units in the Beijing literary and art circles has entered the stage of ideological examination. Some units have conducted relatively in-depth examinations, while others have become perfunctory and have not well developed criticism and self-criticism. The reason for this situation is mainly that some comrades still have ideological concerns about criticism and self-criticism, worrying about "lowering their prestige" or "losing the trust of the leadership," mistakenly believing that "if I openly examine myself, I will have no face to continue working."

Facts have proven that these concerns are completely unnecessary and wrong, and will inevitably hinder one's ability to correct mistakes. Comrades who have openly and deeply examined their mistakes and shortcomings have not only not lowered their prestige, but on the contrary, due to their frankness and sincerity, and their correct attitude towards their mistakes, the surrounding comrades and the masses have increased their support and love for them. Another approach has produced the opposite result. Anyone who has behaved dishonestly during the examination and adopted a defensive attitude towards their mistakes has been unanimously dissatisfied with by everyone, who believe, "He is not taking the path of self-transformation, but the path of death!" Such a person will inevitably lose "prestige" and "trust."

In the study of the Central Conservatory of Music and the Music Work Group, some erroneous ideological tendencies were discovered. Some teachers despise politics, mistakenly believing that "politics is dirty"; some verbally admit to serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, but in reality, they serve the petty bourgeoisie and attempt to find reasons for themselves, believing that "a division of labor is possible"; some composers have strong individualistic thoughts of "becoming famous" and "establishing a school," and are single-mindedly trying to create "repertoire programs" (works not subject to time limitations), refusing to combine with the people's struggle, and abstractly pursuing technical standards. In addition, there is also an idea that simply regards popularization and improvement as a matter of technical skill. These erroneous ideas are continuing to be criticized.

The People's Fine Arts Publishing House is examining the following key points: (1) Correcting the tendency to deviate from politics; (2) Overcoming the purely technical viewpoint and opposing shoddy work; (3) Resolving the relationship between individual artistic creation and the revolutionary cause, overcoming the attitude of uneasiness with administrative and editorial work, correcting bureaucratism in administrative work, and strengthening ideological leadership; (4) Criticizing the liberal style.

The Chinese Opera Research Institute is criticizing the following ideas: (1) Anti-historical viewpoint; (2) Purely technical viewpoints, such as the Beijing school of thought, formalism, etc.; (3) Feudal, bourgeois, and petty-bourgeois artistic ideas, including vulgar tastes, etc.

The Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Literary and Art Department are examining the following key points: (1) The petty-bourgeois ideological tendencies of the leadership; (2) The shoddy style in creation; (3) The sectarianism and the tendency to surrender to old forms in the popular literary and art creation movement. Individual authors have serious "small circle" tendencies, believing that if the literary and art circles outside the "small circle" do not recognize themselves, they will not recognize them either. They believe that shoddy work is legal and reasonable, advocating "edit whatever is submitted," and "winning through quantity rather than quality."

### 北京市文艺界学习运动进入思想检查阶段

    北京市文艺界学习运动进入思想检查阶段
    北京市文艺界各单位整风学习已进入思想检查阶段。有些单位的检查比较深入，也有些单位在检查时流于形式，没有很好展开批评和自我批评。造成这种情况的原因，主要是有些同志对批评和自我批评还有思想顾虑，担心“降低威信”，或者“失去领导方面的信任”，错误地认为“如果公开检讨，自己就没脸再干下去啦”。
    事实证明：这些顾虑完全是不必要的，错误的，必然阻碍自己纠正错误的。凡是公开深刻检讨了自己错误和缺点的同志，不仅没有降低自己威信，相反地，由于他的坦白和诚恳，由于他的正确对待自己错误的态度，周围的同志和群众莫不增强了对他的拥护和爱戴。另一种作法，却造成了相反的结果。凡是在检讨时表现了不老实，为自己的错误采取辩护的态度的人们，大家对他就一致不满，认为：“他不是走自我改造的道路，而是走死亡的道路！”这样的人必然丧失“威信”和“信任”。
    在中央音乐学院和音乐工作团的学习中，发现了一些错误的思想倾向。有些教员轻视政治，错误地认为“政治是肮脏的”；有些人口头上承认为工农兵服务，实际上却为小资产阶级服务，并且企图为自己寻找理由，认为“可以来个分工”；有些作曲者具有“成名”“成家”的浓厚的个人主义思想，一心想创作“保留节目”（不受时间性限制的作品），拒绝和人民的斗争结合，抽象地追求技术上的标准。此外还有一种思想，把普及和提高只单纯地看成是一个技术的高低问题。这些错误思想正在继续被批判中。
    人民美术出版社检查下列几个重点：（一）纠正脱离政治倾向；（二）克服单纯技术观点，反对粗制滥造；（三）解决个人艺术创作和革命事业的关系问题，克服不安心作行政和编辑工作的态度，纠正行政工作上的事务主义，加强思想领导；（四）批判自由主义作风。
    中国戏曲研究院批判下列几种思想：（一）反历史主义观点；（二）单纯技术观点，如京派思想、形式主义等；（三）封建的、资产阶级的、小资产阶级的艺术思想，包括低级趣味等。
    北京市文学艺术界联合会和文艺处检查下列各重点：（一）领导方面的小资产阶级思想倾向；（二）创作中的粗制滥造作风；（三）通俗文艺创作运动中的宗派主义思想，投降旧形式的倾向。个别作者有严重的“小圈子”主义，认为“小圈子”以外的文艺界如果不承认自己，自己也就不承认他们。认为粗制滥造是合法合理的，主张“有稿即编”，“以量胜质”。
