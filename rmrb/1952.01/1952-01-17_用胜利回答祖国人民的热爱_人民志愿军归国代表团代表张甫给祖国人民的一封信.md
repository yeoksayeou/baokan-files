Dear Fathers, Elders, Brothers and Sisters of the Motherland:
　　We have returned to the Korean front with the entrustment and hope of the people of the motherland to convey to the troops the situation of resisting America and aiding Korea in the past year in the motherland.
　　We crossed the Yalu River and entered Korean territory. The car traveled south in the dark. The cities we passed through—Sinuiju, Sonchon, and Jeongju—were still piles of rubble, and not a single person was to be seen in the silence. Enemy planes were still bombing these ruins aimlessly, causing piles of fire everywhere. Our car quickly passed through these ruins, heading south and towards the front line. Korean young men and women stood on the roads or at road intersections, holding red and white flags, whistling, and pointing the way forward for the cars going south or north. As soon as they heard the sound of enemy planes, they shouted the simple Chinese phrase "Air raid!" The driver comrades immediately turned off the car's lights. The people in the rear of Korea, for the victory of the front line, every night thousands and thousands of people stand on the roads leading to the front line, faithfully performing the task of air defense alert and car communication; as soon as it dawns, they return home to carry out production or do various war service work. They are supporting us day and night for the victory of the front line.
　　The roads we passed through have been repaired to be wide and flat, and the past third-class and second-class roads have been repaired into first-class highways; many new roads have also been opened, and these roads have been built by soldiers and the Korean people together.
　　In order to widen a third-class road running east-west on a high mountain into a first-class road, a certain unit mobilized the commanders and fighters of the unit to start working together, implementing it as resolutely as a combat order, and completed it in thirty days. The roadbed was leveled with two layers of fine gravel and then compacted, and the road surface was covered with a layer of fine sand. Although the soldiers had no experience in repairing roads, they knew that "repairing roads is also an important condition for winning the war." Therefore, they came up with many ways to overcome difficulties. Large stones weighing three to five thousand catties were moved or pushed into the big mountain gullies by human effort. They happily said: "No matter how hard the stone is, it is not as hard as our determination!" "The stone is like American imperialism, and we are like the people of the world. Pushing the stone into the mountain gully is like pushing American imperialism into the sea!" With such heroic and arduous spirit, they overcame various difficulties and saved 15,000 catties of explosives.
　　How happy the soldiers are for the big road they built with their own hands! They also built waterways under the dangerous bends of the high mountains; on the edges, they built fences with tree trunks or built retaining walls, and on the retaining walls, they used white pebbles to form beautiful characters such as "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!" and "Resist America and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country" to show commemoration.
　　One night, several tanks drove east on the road. The soldiers heard the rumbling sound of the tanks, got out of bed, and ran to the road together. The tanks had already passed. In the dark night, the soldiers stretched out their hands and touched the big road they had built, thinking, "Will it be crushed? Will it be skewed?" They touched it and it was still the same, and they happily said, "Great, our road is very strong!" In the darkness, another soldier continued, "I will feel relieved after a few more pass by!"
　　Enemy planes constantly harassed and attacked day and night. During the day, the soldiers disguised themselves with green branches. As soon as they detected enemy planes approaching, they lay motionless on the side of the road. After the enemy planes passed, they got up and continued to work with their tools. One night, their anti-aircraft machine gunners shot down an enemy heavy bomber with eight bullets. The pilot and the plane were burned in a big mountain gully.
　　Enemy planes not only bombed and strafed on the roads and the ruins of the already destroyed cities, but also carried out crazy and brutal destructive bombing and strafing in the peaceful villages inside the mountain gullies.
　　A platoon of the guard company of a certain unit's logistics department was stationed in Tuitanli. Four enemy planes swooped down and strafed, dropping gasoline bombs. Suddenly, the houses burst into flames. Platoon leader Zhang Xueyan, under the enemy planes' low-altitude circling and fierce strafing, bravely rushed into the house three times, braving the fire, and carried out an old lady and two children who could not escape the fire. Second Platoon Leader Fan Baowa and soldiers Tang Mingdao and Li Jinchang of the Sixth Squad also bravely climbed onto the houses to pour water and put out the fire; Squad Leader Du Hechang of the Fourth Squad, regardless of his own safety, braved the flames to help the landlord grab 50 bundles of wheat. The entire company rescued 14 houses. The affected people shed tears of anger at the enemy. The old lady gratefully said to our soldiers: "I have lived for seventy-six years and have never seen such a good army. They saved our family of three. We will never forget the kindness of the Volunteer Army." There are endless heroic stories of fighting fires and rescuing the Korean people. They can be found in any unit. Our soldiers are so highly imbued with the spirit of internationalism in loving the Korean people.
　　Our soldiers also helped the Korean people build houses, cultivate land, harvest crops, or save food to relieve them. For example, the Fifth Squad of the Second Platoon of the Third Company saw that the house of a 74-year-old Mrs. Kim was destroyed by enemy planes and her son was killed, leaving the 74-year-old Mrs. Kim homeless. Comrade Yu Ze'an, the platoon leader of the Second Platoon, proposed to the Fifth Squad to build a small house for Mrs. Kim, and the soldiers of the Fifth Squad immediately started building it. Mrs. Kim was so moved that she insisted on recognizing Platoon Leader Yu as her godson, and happily danced in front of the soldiers of the Fifth Squad to express her gratitude. For another example, Liang, the political commissar of a certain regiment, led the troops to personally work, and in just sixteen days, they completed more than 1,300 workdays and shoveled 144 mu of land. The comrades of a certain artillery battalion used their nap time to help harvest 42 mu of wheat. In particular, the Second Company of the battalion braved the heavy rain to help the masses harvest and also picked up more than 20,000 catties of firewood to relieve the affected residents. The Vice-Chairman of Goksan County said: "Among the 27 ris in the entire county, Guirongri in Dongchon-myeon completed the production plan ahead of schedule and actively supported the war. It was selected as a second-class model. This is inseparable from the volunteer army's efforts and help." The residents of the garrison also wrote letters of appreciation to the Volunteer Army. The residents and refugees of Umil-ri alone wrote more than 80 letters of appreciation. After the autumn harvest, the residents and government of the garrison of a certain regiment held a joint celebration meeting and presented a large banner to the troops. The banner read: "Share hardships and save the people." The meeting place was also filled with slogans such as "Long live the Volunteer Army!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" Every soldier of our Volunteer Army knows that the suffering of the Korean people is our own suffering. Therefore, we try our best to help the masses in every possible way. Under this high spirit of internationalism, they have strengthened the relationship between the army and the people and strengthened the unity between the army and the people.
　　The enemy's atrocities in Korea have caused suffering to the Korean people and have also aroused the hatred of our troops for the enemy. Therefore, all units consciously proposed a movement to save rice and donate money to relieve the refugees. Wang Chenglin, a soldier of a certain unit, said: "The pain of the Korean people is our pain. This is caused by American imperialism. I will first take out all the 20,000 yuan of consolation money given to me by the people of the motherland to relieve the refugees." Under his influence, it was popularized throughout the unit. With everyone's saving and frugality, a total of 46,099 catties of rice, 1,100 Korean won, 85,000 yuan of RMB, and 92 pieces of clothing were saved to relieve 2,781 households and 7,215 people (including 160 households and 607 people of military families). The medical clinic of a certain logistics department treated 202 patients for the masses. All this shows the great international friendship of our soldiers towards the Korean people.
　　The above situation is what I personally visited or witnessed in the reports of various units. Now, let me report on some of the situations in which I reported to the troops on the motherland's movement to resist America and aid Korea!
　　When we arrived at the front line, we continued to take turns to various troops to report as tense as we were in the country. Every time we arrived at a unit, we were warmly welcomed by the leaders and soldiers of the unit. Sometimes they lined up at night and waited until midnight to welcome us. When they saw us, they played military music, presented flowers, and excitedly lifted us up.
　　In the report, when they heard about the great achievements of the people of our motherland in supporting the front line in the movement to resist America and aid Korea in the past year, they sometimes clapped their hands excitedly because of the vivid facts, and sometimes they shed tears of emotion. After hearing the report, the soldiers unanimously said: "Our motherland is great. With the support of the 500 million people of the motherland, victory must be ours!" Some people also said: "The construction of the motherland is really fast! When we return to the motherland victoriously, I am afraid we will become unrecognizable." Hearing that the coal miners and steelworkers of the motherland are working hard to increase production and save money to support the front line, they feel even more the greatness of the working class of the motherland. Many soldiers are very moved when they hear about the people of the motherland enthusiastically launching a campaign to donate money to buy airplanes and cannons. The soldiers were all moved to tears when they heard that Mr. Tan Chuyun, a 76-year-old man from Xiangtan City, was carrying five loads of water every day and saving long-term donations. The soldiers unanimously made up their minds and formulated training and combat plans. The 16 groups of the Ninth Company of a certain regiment all formulated determination plans, expressing their willingness to humbly learn and improve their military skills, and to use practical actions to train well and fight well. Even more units immediately wrote letters to the people and factories of the motherland to express their condolences and put forward specific guarantees: to fight the next battle well to answer the support, love, and hope of the people of the motherland for us.
　　After listening to the report on the motherland's movement to resist America and aid Korea, the soldiers of a certain unit, carrying the hope of the people of the motherland, rushed to the front line after six days and six nights of marching to carry out heroic and arduous blocking battles.
　　On November 13th last year, the 3rd Battalion of the 19th Regiment of the 24th Division of the US Army, with two companies of troops, offended an unnamed high ground north of Shuangkongdong. The Fifth Squad of our Seventh Company and other soldiers of each squad immediately rose up to meet the enemy and gave the enemy a head-on blow, winning a victory of annihilating more than 80 enemies, and bravely repelled the enemy, not allowing the enemy to advance an inch.
　　On the 13th, the enemy increased from more than a dozen to a company, from a company to two companies. From 9:00 a.m. to about 5:00 p.m., they carried out five counterattacks in a row within seven and a half hours. Our heroic soldiers launched fierce battles in front of the position, causing a large number of casualties to the enemy.
　　Luo Zhonghua, the deputy squad leader of the Fifth Squad, was digging out the comrades buried in the fortifications with one hand, and throwing grenades at the enemies who rushed up. He shouted: "Comrades! Fight quickly! We must live up to the support and love of the people of the motherland for us! Don't let the American devils come up!" He threw 30 grenades in a row. Finally, when the enemy rushed in front of him, he raised his submachine gun and strafed at the enemy. Wu Shouqing, the squad leader of the Fifth Squad, and Song Dexi, the deputy squad leader of the Fourth Squad, woke up from the collapsed fortifications and immediately started throwing grenades at the enemy. Chen Xianneng, a member of the Communist Youth League, had two fingers on his right hand blown off. The pain was excruciating, but the pain could not destroy the hero's will and determination to kill the enemy. Comrade Chen Xianneng endured the severe pain and still insisted on fighting, holding two large bundles of grenades, picking them up with his left hand, and throwing them at the enemy one by one, exploding in the enemy group.
　　At this time, Comrade Wang Yushu, the second platoon leader, led the soldiers of the Sixth Squad to support and launched a counterattack. Hou Desheng, a soldier of the Sixth Squad, was wounded in the leg. He still shouted: "We are all excellent soldiers loved by the people of the motherland. We wounded comrades cannot be idle either. Fight quickly!" He jumped out of the trench and rushed towards the enemy with his submachine gun. Other wounded soldiers also stood up strongly and bravely fought against the American devils.
　　Zhou Huade, a bugler in the company headquarters, delivered ammunition and also fought with the enemy. The soldiers of the Eighth Squad and half a group of the Seventh Squad, under the leadership of Huang Jun, the deputy platoon leader of the Third Platoon, also came to join the battle. Comrade Huang Jun said to Comrade Hu Daoyu, the deputy company commander: "If I sacrifice, please the Party to posthumously recognize me as a Communist Party member." He jumped out of the trench and rushed directly to the enemy, shouting loudly: "Comrades! We must protect Chairman Mao! We must love the people of the motherland! We must answer the love of the people of the motherland for us with victory. Comrades, charge! Kill!" The soldiers heard his shouts, and suddenly their whole body was full of courage, their whole body was full of strength, and they all charged and fought the enemy.
　　In the battle, our powerful artillery also bombarded the enemy fiercely, effectively cooperating with the infantry, causing a large number of casualties to the enemy. One shell knocked down eight American soldiers, who died on the forward edge of the position.
　　Groups of American devils fell down. At dusk, more than sixty bodies that had not been dragged away by the enemy were lying in disarray on the forward edge of the position. The rest of the enemies had to sneak back in the cover of smoke bombs. Our Fifth Squad's position still stood firmly on the front line of the battle. In addition to annihilating more than 80 enemies, this day's battle also destroyed two tanks, and shot down an enemy plane on the right friendly neighbor's position.
　　At night, the soldiers held a battle review meeting in the shelters of the trenches. They said: "This can be regarded as a small gift that we have just begun to present to the people of the motherland to answer their love for us when we come to the front line."
　　The soldiers on the front line positions are very heroic and very arduous. Sometimes they cannot eat a hot meal, drink a sip of hot water, or smoke a cigarette. They bake the leaves dry, fry them with a little bean oil or lard, and smoke a little oily taste. They said to me with a smile: "We don't hope to smoke cigarettes, we will be satisfied if we can smoke tobacco leaf crumbs." The soldiers do not feel that this is arduous, but on the contrary, they feel that this is glorious! This is great!
　　They are very nervous, and even at night they have no time to rest, either building fortifications or fighting. They all have strong will and confidence, and can crush all the enemy's attacks at any time.

### 用胜利回答祖国人民的热爱——人民志愿军归国代表团代表张甫给祖国人民的一封信

    用胜利回答祖国人民的热爱
    ——人民志愿军归国代表团代表张甫给祖国人民的一封信亲爱的祖国父老兄弟姊妹们：
    我们带着祖国人民的委托和希望回到朝鲜前线，向部队传达祖国一年来的抗美援朝情况。
    我们跨过鸭绿江，进入朝鲜境内，汽车在黑夜中向南行进，所经过的一些城市——新义州、宣川、定州，依然是一堆废墟，静寂的不见一个人。敌人的飞机仍然还不停息地在这些废墟上，盲无目标地轰炸，到处起着一堆堆的火光。我们的汽车从这些废墟上迅速通过，直向南、向前线上奔去。朝鲜的男女青年，都站在公路上，或站在公路的岔口上，手执着红旗和白旗，嘴里吹着口哨，向南、或向北指示着汽车前进的方向。一听到敌机的声音响，都喊出：简单的中国话“防空！”驾驶员同志也就马上关闭了汽车上的灯。朝鲜后方的人民为了前线的胜利，每天晚上都有成千成万的人民，站在通向前线的几条公路上，忠诚地执行着对空警戒，对汽车联络的任务；天一明，他们又回家进行生产，或做着战争勤务的各种工作。他们为了前线的胜利，日夜不停地支援着我们。
    我们所通过的各条公路，都已修得宽大而平坦，把过去的三级、二级公路都已修成了一级的大公路；还开辟了很多新公路，这些公路都是部队战士和朝鲜人民在一起修成的。
    某部为了加宽在高山上横贯东西的一条三级公路，要修成一级公路，动员了部队的指战员一齐动手，如同作战命令一样坚决执行，三十天就完成了。路基都用两层细石子铺平再加以捣固，路面又再铺上了一层细沙。虽然战士对修公路没有什么经验，但是，他们知道：“修好公路也是争取战争胜利的重要条件”，因此，他们就想出了很多克服困难的办法。对三、五千斤重的大石头，都是用人工合力把它搬走或推下大山沟里面，他们高兴地说：“石头再硬，也没有我们大家的决心硬！”“石头好比美帝国主义，我们好比全世界人民，把石头推到山沟里，就好像把美帝国主义推下大海去！”他们用这样的英勇、艰苦的精神克服了各种困难，节省炸药一万五千斤。
    战士对于他们亲手修起的大公路是多么地高兴啊！他们又在高山转弯险要的路底下，修了水道；在边沿上，以树杆修成边栏或砌成边墙，在边墙上又用白石子砌成“中朝人民友谊万岁！”“抗美援朝，保家卫国”等美丽的字样，以示纪念。
    一天夜里，在公路上向东跑过去了几辆坦克。战士们听见坦克发出辘辘的声音，就爬起床来，一齐跑到公路上，坦克已经早过去了，在漆黑的夜里，战士们都伸出了手，摸着自己修的大公路，心里想：“是不是会轧坏？是不是会轧斜？”他们一摸还是原样，高兴地说：“好了，我们的公路可修得坚固哩！”在黑暗中另一个战士接着说：“再多过几辆，我才放心呢！”
    敌人的飞机昼夜不断来扰乱和袭击，战士们在白天都以绿色树枝伪装起来，一发现敌机临空，他们就伏在路边上不动，敌机过去了，他们又爬起身抡起工具继续干起来。在一天晚上，他们的高射机枪手曾以八发子弹打下敌人重轰炸机一架，驾驶员与飞机烧毁在大山沟里。
    敌人飞机不但在公路上和已经炸毁的城市的废墟上轰炸扫射，在大山沟里面的和平乡村也施行着疯狂残暴的毁灭性的轰炸和扫射。
    某部后勤部监护连一个排驻在推滩里，敌机四架俯冲扫射，投下汽油弹，顿时房子焰火大起，班长张学彦在敌机低空盘旋和猛烈地扫射下，奋不顾身，三次冒着大火，冲进房子里背出逃不出火坑的一位老太太和两个小孩子。二排长范保娃，六班战士唐明道、李金昌也奋勇爬上了房子浇水扑火；四班长杜和昌也不顾自己一切冒着火焰帮助房东抢出小麦五十捆，全连救出房子十四幢。被难的人民流着对敌人愤怒的眼泪，那位老太太感激地对我们战士说：“我活了七十六岁，没有见过这样好的军队，救了我们一家三口，我们永远也不能忘了志愿军的恩情。”这种救火和抢救朝鲜人民的英勇事例是说不完的，随便在那一个部队都可以找出。我们的战士，就是这样具备着热爱朝鲜人民的高度的国际主义精神。
    我们的战士还帮助朝鲜人民盖房、耕地、收割，或节约粮食救济他们。如三连二排五班看见一位七十四岁的金老太太，房子被敌机炸毁，儿子被炸死，使这位七十四岁的金老太太无房可住。我二排长于泽安同志向五班提出要给这位金老太太修盖一幢小房，五班战士当即动手修起。金老太太被感动一定要认于排长为干儿，高兴地在五班战士面前跳起舞来，对五班表示慰问。又如：某团梁政委率领部队亲自动手，仅十六天，一千三百多个工，铲地一百四十四亩。某炮营的同志们利用午睡时间帮助割麦四十二亩。特别是该营二连冒着大雨帮助群众收割回来，还拾柴两万余斤救济被难的居民。谷山郡副委员长说：“全郡二十七个里中，东村面贵洛里提前完成了生产计划，积极支援了战争，被选为二等模范，这是与志愿军的努力帮助分不开的。”驻地群众也纷纷向志愿军写信慰问，仅右密里群众及难民就写慰问信有八十余封。某团驻地群众与政府在秋收后开了一个联欢大会，并向部队献了一面大旗，旗上面写着：“同难共苦救人民。”会场上并贴满了“志愿军万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的标语。我们志愿军每一个战士都知道：朝鲜人民的苦，就是我们自己的苦。因此，想尽一切办法尽一切力量帮助群众，他们在这种高度的国际主义精神下，密切了军民关系，加强了军民之间的团结。
    敌人在朝鲜的暴行造成了对朝鲜人民的疾苦，也激发了我部队战士对敌人的仇恨心。因此，各单位自觉地提出节米募捐运动，救济难民。某部战士王成林说：“朝鲜人民的痛苦，就是我们的痛苦，这是美帝国主义造成的，我首先把祖国人民献给我的慰问金两万元，全部拿出救济难民。”在他的影响下普及了某部整个部队，在大家省食节约下共节米四万六千零九十九斤、朝鲜币一千一百元、人民币八万五千元、衣服九十二件，救济了难民二千七百八十一户，七千二百十五人（内有军属一百六十户，六百零七人）。某后勤部医务所给群众医治好病人二百零二人。这一切都显示了我们战士对朝鲜人民的伟大的国际友谊。
    这以上的情况，是我在各部队报告中亲自访问或我亲眼所见到的。现在，我再汇报一下我在部队传达报告祖国抗美援朝运动的一些情况吧！
    我们到了前线仍然和在国内一样紧张地轮流到各部队进行着传达。我们每到一个部队，都得到部队首长和战士们的热烈欢迎。有时他们在夜间列队站到半夜等待着欢迎，他们见了我们就奏军乐，献鲜花，兴奋地把我们抬起来。
    在报告中，他们听到我们祖国人民一年来抗美援朝运动支援前线的伟大成绩，时而被生动的事实兴奋的鼓起掌来，也有时被感动得流出了热泪，战士们听到了报告后，一致这样说：“我们的祖国伟大，有祖国五万万人民的支援，胜利一定是我们的！”也有人说：“祖国建设的真快呀！等我们胜利回到祖国去，恐怕都要变得不认识了。”听到祖国煤矿工人和炼钢工人，都在努力增产节约支援前线，就更加感到祖国工人阶级的伟大，许多战士听到祖国人民热烈展开捐款购买飞机大炮运动的情形，都很受感动。战士听到湘潭市七十六岁的谭楚云老先生，每天挑水五担，储蓄长期捐献，都被感动得流下眼泪，战士们都一致下定决心，订出练兵战斗计划。某团九连十六个小组都订立了决心计划书，表示要虚心学习，提高军事技术，要以实际行动，练好兵，打好仗。更有许多单位马上向祖国人民和工厂写信慰问并提出具体保证：要打好下一仗来回答祖国人民对我们的支援、热爱和希望。
    某部战士听完了祖国抗美援朝运动的报告，带着祖国人民的希望经过六天六夜的行军奔上了前线，进行着英勇和艰苦的阻击战。
    去年十一月十三日，美军第二十四师十九团第三营以两个连的兵力，向双空洞以北某无名高地冒犯，我七连五班与其他各班战士当即奋起迎战，予敌以迎头痛击，获得歼敌八十余名的胜利战绩，并英勇地击退了敌人，不让敌人前进一寸一尺。
    十三日这一天，敌人是由十多个增加到一个连，由一个连增加到二个连，从上午九时起至下午五时左右，七个半钟头内，连续进行了五次反击。我英勇的战士们就在阵地前面展开了大量杀伤敌人的激烈战斗。
    五班副班长罗忠华，一面用手把埋在工事里的同志挖掘出来，一面向冲上来的敌人投掷手榴弹，他高喊着：“同志们！快打呀！我们要对得起祖国人民对我们的支援和热爱呀！不让美国鬼子上来一个！”他一连抛出了三十颗手榴弹，最后敌人冲到他的面前，他又端起了冲锋枪向敌人扫射。五班长吴守清和四班副班长宋德喜从倒塌的工事里觉醒过来，也马上向敌人打起手榴弹。青年团员陈先能右手两个指头被打掉了，指痛钻心，可是疼痛摧不毁英雄杀敌的意志和决心，陈先能同志忍受着剧痛，仍坚持着战斗，两次抱了大捆的手榴弹，用左手拿起，一个个的打向敌人，在敌群中开了花。
    这时二排长王玉书同志带着六班战士赶来支援，发起了反击。六班战士侯德生腿上负了伤，他还喊着：“我们都是祖国人民热爱的优秀战士，负伤的同志，我们也不能闲着，快打呀！”他跳出战壕，端着冲锋枪向敌人冲去。其他的伤员也坚强的站起来，奋勇地向美国鬼子进行搏战。
    连部小司号员周化德送弹药上来，也和敌人干起来。八班和七班半个组的战士，在三排副排长黄骏的率领下也赶来参加战斗，黄骏同志向副连长胡道余同志说：“我要是牺牲了，请党追认我为共产党员。”他跳出战壕，直向敌人冲过去，高声喊着：“同志们！我们要保卫毛主席！要爱祖国人民！要以胜利回答祖国人民对我们的热爱，同志们冲啊！杀啊！”战士们听到了他的喊声，顿时全身都是勇敢，全身都是力量，一齐向敌人拚杀起来。
    在战斗中，我们的强大炮火，也向敌人猛烈地轰击了，有力地配合了步兵，大量杀伤了敌人，有一发炮弹就打倒了八个美国兵，死在阵地前沿。
    美国鬼子一群群的倒下去了。黄昏时间，阵地前沿横七竖八的摆着尚未被敌人拖走的六十多具尸体，其余的敌人也只得在烟幕弹的掩护下，跌跌爬爬地溜回去。我们五班的阵地，仍然坚毅屹立在战斗的前线上。这一天的战斗，除了歼敌八十余名以外，还打毁两辆坦克，在右边友邻阵地上还击落敌机一架。
    夜晚，战士们在战壕的掩蔽部里，开起战斗检讨会来，他们说：“这就算是我们来到前线回答祖国人民对我们的热爱，初次开始的一个小小的献礼吧。”
    在前线阵地上的战士们，他们都是很英勇的又都是很艰苦的。他们有时吃不上一口热饭，喝不上一口热水，吸不到一根纸烟。他们把树叶烤干，用一点豆油或猪油炒一下，吸一点油味，他们笑着对我说：“我们不希望能吸上纸烟，能吸到烟叶末子也就心满意足了。”战士们不感到这是艰苦，而相反感到这是光荣！这是伟大！
    他们很紧张，甚至夜晚也连一点休息时间都没有，不是在修工事，就是在战斗，他们都有坚强的意志和信心，随时都可以粉碎敌人的一切进攻。
