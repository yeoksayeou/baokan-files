    He Long on the Front Lines of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign
  　Chen Lin
    In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, He Long, Secretary of the CPC Southwest Military Region Committee and Commander of the Southwest Military Region, personally led the way “to the front lines,” encouraging the entire army to carry out the movement to the end.

    Last November, He Long presided over the CPC Southwest Military Region Party Representative Conference. At this conference, he discovered serious corruption and waste, and bureaucratic work styles existing within various departments and units of the military region. The bourgeoisie was corrupting the combat effectiveness of the Party and the People's Liberation Army. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, he led the entire military region to quickly and vigorously launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. He Long regarded this movement as a great war of proletarian ideology against bourgeois ideology. He demonstrated the fighting posture of a revolutionary soldier in the movement, showing no hesitation or procrastination.

    Under his leadership, the military region established a Thrift Inspection Committee. He Long frequently visited the committee to check on its work, sometimes inquiring by telephone, and kept abreast of the development of the movement every day. Staff members of the committee said, "With Commander He Long's support, we are even bolder in mobilizing the masses." When certain leading cadres, because they themselves were not clean, loudly proclaimed the mass movement to be "excessive" or "extremely democratic," He Long resolutely supported the masses, encouraged their fighting spirit, and instructed all units to "sweep away the stumbling blocks to the movement." He pointed out, "The standard for whether the movement is being carried out is whether the masses are being mobilized."

    For certain responsible cadres who had made mistakes involving corruption and waste, He Long personally spoke with them, eliminated their concerns, explained the Party's policies, and encouraged them to confess and admit their mistakes voluntarily, in order to encourage other cadres with problems to conduct self-criticism.

    Many soldiers in the military region's logistics department wrote letters to He Long saying, "The corruption and waste in our unit are very serious. It is time to stop this unhealthy trend, and to thoroughly eliminate it. We are determined to wage a relentless struggle against these undesirable tendencies under the leadership of the Party and you." He Long often used these letters, brimming with righteousness, to educate cadres, explaining that the revolutionary qualities of the vast numbers of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army always occupy an absolutely dominant and positive position in the army, and can overcome all undesirable tendencies.

    He Long recognized that the corruption and waste, and bureaucratic work styles in construction work were the most serious areas. He went deep into the grassroots to conduct on-the-spot inspections. He spent over twenty consecutive days with several cadres, traveling between various construction sites, praising those that were well-built, and personally supervising the modification or ordering the suspension of work on those that did not meet specifications or were poorly located. On one occasion, He Long discovered that a building was very flimsy and immediately ordered engineering personnel to inspect it, which revealed that there had been cutting of corners. He Long used the vivid materials from the inspection to educate all logistics and construction cadres. He sharply criticized those who used the excuse of "constructing permanent buildings" to engage in large-scale waste.

    He Long discovered that a bureaucratic leader in a certain unit had just built a foreign-style house, while the soldiers nearby were living in dilapidated shacks. He Long was extremely indignant about this incident and immediately ordered that the house built by the bureaucratic leader be given to the soldiers to live in.

    He Long often used the words that Chairman Mao had said to him in Yan'an to educate cadres. He Long recalled that once when he was leaving Yan'an to go to the front lines, life in Yan'an was very difficult, and Chairman Mao said to him, "In the future, when the revolution is victorious, we must not forget these difficult days." But many cadres had indeed forgotten that period of hardship after entering the big cities. He Long often said, "Chairman Mao taught us to be servants of the people, but we have not served the people well; we have broken many pieces of the people's furniture!" He felt extremely pained and indignant at this tendency.

    He Long instructed the entire military region: Corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are a matter of political principle, and are a reflection of the decadent bourgeois ideology and work style within the Party and the army. If they are not quickly and resolutely extinguished, they will seriously damage the combat effectiveness of our Party and the essence of the People's Army, and put us in danger of becoming separated from the masses. He Long pointed out that in the movement, disciplinary sanctions should be imposed on those who are corrupt and degenerate with bad qualities, and those who are hardworking and simple should be commended, in order to strike down evil and uphold righteousness.

    Under He Long's leadership, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Southwest Military Region is developing healthily. This movement has further enhanced the broad masses' understanding of the Party and their confidence in the revolutionary cause. A cook squad leader said, "In the past, when I saw the corruption and waste of individual cadres, I thought the Party's policies had changed. Now I realize even more that Chairman Mao's leadership is wise and will always be correct, it's just that the thinking of a few people in our ranks has gone bad." Some retained personnel said in surprise, "The Communist Party dares to oppose corruption and waste in such a big way, and leaders can also be openly criticized, it's really amazing!" They unanimously believe that the Chinese Communist Party will certainly be able to lead the Chinese revolution forward forever.

    贺龙在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的战线上
  　陈临
    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中，中共西南军区党委书记、西南军区司令员贺龙亲自“上前线”领导，鼓舞全军把运动贯彻到底。
    去年十一月，贺龙主持召开了中共西南军区党代表会议。在这次会议上，他发现军区各机关、部队中存在着严重的贪污、浪费现象和官僚主义作风，资产阶级正在腐蚀着党和人民解放军的战斗力。他遵照毛主席的指示，领导全军区迅速大张旗鼓地开展反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动。贺龙把这一运动当作一场无产阶级思想对资产阶级思想的大战争。他在运动中表现了革命军人的战斗姿态，毫无畏首畏尾拖泥带水的模样。
    在他主持下，军区成立了节约检查委员会。贺龙经常到委员会去检查工作，有时用电话询问，每天都掌握着运动的发展情况。委员会的工作人员都说：“有贺司令员撑腰，我们就更大胆放手发动群众。”当某些领导干部因为本身不干净而大叫群众运动“过火”或“极端民主”的时候，贺龙坚决为群众撑腰，鼓励群众的斗争勇气，指示各单位“必须扫清运动的绊脚石”。他指出：“运动开展与否的标准在于群众是否发动。”
    对于某些有贪污、浪费错误的负责干部，贺龙亲自和他们谈话，消除顾虑，阐明党的政策，鼓励他们自动坦白认错，以带动其他有问题的干部检讨。
    军区后勤部许多战士写信给贺龙说：“我们单位存在的贪污、浪费现象是很严重的，是到了停止这种歪风的时候了，是彻底清除这种歪风的时候了。我们坚决在党和你的领导下向不良倾向作毫不容情的斗争。”贺龙经常拿这些正气磅礴的信件来教育干部，说明人民解放军广大指挥员和战斗员的革命品质始终是在部队中占绝对优势的积极因素，是可以战胜一切不良倾向的。
    贺龙认清建筑工作中存在的贪污、浪费现象和官僚主义作风是最严重的部分。他深入下层实地检查工作。他带着几个干部一连二十多天在各个建筑工地间奔走，发现建筑得好的，加以表扬；发现不合规格，地势不当的，就亲自监督修改或勒令停工。有一次贺龙发现有一幢建筑物很不坚固，立即命令工程人员检查，果然有偷工减料的事情。贺龙用检查得来的生动材料教育一切后勤建筑干部。他对那些藉口“修建永久性的建筑”而大肆浪费的人予以尖锐的批评。
    贺龙发现某部有一个官僚主义领导者正修好了一幢洋房，而附近的战士却住在破烂席棚里。贺龙对这件事异常愤慨，立即命令把那个官僚主义者所修建的房子让给战士住。
    贺龙经常用毛主席在延安对他说过的话来教育干部。贺龙回忆有一次离开延安到前线去，那时延安的生活非常艰苦，毛主席对他说：“将来革命胜利了，我们也不要忘了这种艰苦日子。”但是许多干部在进入大城市后确实已经忘掉那一段艰苦生活了。贺龙常说：“毛主席教育我们要当人民的勤务员，可是我们没有给人民当好勤务员，我们把人民的许多家具一件件地打碎了！”他对这种倾向感到异常痛愤。
    贺龙指示全军区说：贪污、浪费和官僚主义是一个政治原则问题，是腐朽的资产阶级思想作风在党内军内的反映。如不迅速地坚决地扑灭，必将严重损害我党的战斗力和人民军队的本质，使我们有脱离群众的危险。贺龙指出在运动中要给予那些品质恶劣的贪污蜕化分子以纪律制裁，对艰苦朴素的指战员要予以表扬，以打击邪气，伸张正气。
    在贺龙领导下，西南军区的反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动健康地发展着。这一运动进一步提高了广大群众对党的认识和对革命事业的信心。一个炊事班长说：“过去看到个别干部的贪污、浪费行为，还以为是党的政策变了，现在才更认识到毛主席的领导是英明的，是永远正确的，只是我们队伍里有少数人的思想坏了。”有的留用人员惊讶地说：“共产党敢这样大张旗鼓地反对贪污、浪费，而且对领导者也可以公开批评，真了不起！”他们一致相信中国共产党一定能够领导中国革命永远前进。
