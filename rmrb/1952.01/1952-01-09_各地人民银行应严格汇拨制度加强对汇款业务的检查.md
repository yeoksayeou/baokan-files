    Local People's Banks Should Strictly Enforce the Remittance System and Strengthen the Inspection of Remittance Business

    Editor: Individual branches and sub-branches, and offices of the People's Bank of China, due to weak work responsibility and disregard for the remittance system, are constantly accumulating large amounts of remittances, seriously affecting commodity circulation and causing losses to state property. For example, on November 17th of the year before last, the Hebei Branch of the China National Cotton, Yarn & Cloth Corporation telegraphed 1 billion yuan from the Hebei Provincial Branch of the People's Bank to the Hengshui County Branch, for remittance to the Nangong Cotton, Yarn & Cloth Company. However, the Hengshui County Branch did not remit it immediately after receiving the telegram. It was not until the Hengshui County Branch and the Provincial Branch reconciled their accounts in May of last year that they discovered the difference of 1 billion yuan. It had been accumulated for 189 days. In addition, People's Banks in Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Hefei and other places also have similar phenomena of accumulating remittances.

    The main reason for the accumulation of remittances is the irresponsibility of some bank business cadres and the chaotic work system. However, the lack of inspection and supervision by the remittance organs is also a major loophole.

    We suggest that local People's Banks strictly implement the remittance system in the future and strengthen the inspection of remittance business in order to reduce the phenomenon of accumulating remittances, so that the country's trade funds can play their due role in a timely manner.

### 各地人民银行应严格汇拨制度加强对汇款业务的检查

    各地人民银行应严格汇拨制度加强对汇款业务的检查
    编辑同志：中国人民银行个别分、支行和办事处的干部，因工作责任心不强，忽视汇兑制度，不断积压大批汇款，严重地影响了商品流转，使国家资财受到了损失。例如，前年十一月十七日，中国花纱布公司河北省分公司由人民银行河北省行电汇十亿元到衡水县行，转汇南宫花纱布公司；但衡水县行接到电报后，没有即刻转汇。直到去年五月，衡水县行和省行对账时，才发现差款十亿元。但已经积压了一百八十九天。此外，广州、福州、合肥等地人民银行也有类似积压汇款的现象。
    积压汇款的主要原因，是银行某些业务干部不负责任，工作制度也很混乱。但汇款机关检查督促不够，也是一个很大的漏洞。
    我们建议各地人民银行今后严格执行汇拨制度，加强对汇款业务的检查，以减少积压汇款现象，使国家的贸易资金能够及时发挥应有的作用。
