    “Like rats scurrying across the street, everyone shouts 'Kill them!'"
    Zhao Zhifang, Miao Di, Painting
    (1) Wang Xiru was a salesman at the privately-owned Binxing Printing Factory in Tianjin. On the morning of December 18th last year, he was about to send his child to school when he opened the street door and a man rushed in, his hat pulled low and his face covered by a mask. After looking at him for a long time, he recognized his nephew Zhao Ren. He found it strange: it was fifty or sixty miles from his hometown in Wuqing County to Tianjin, Zhao Ren must have set off in the night, what urgent matter could it be?

    (2) Zhao Ren stuttered as he told his uncle that someone in the village had stolen cotton from the cooperative and asked him to sell it. Now the person who stole the cotton had committed a crime, and he was afraid of being implicated, so he came to Tianjin to hide. Wang Xiru thought: there must be more to this story. Because he couldn't get any more information out of him right away, he decided to send his child to school first and then go to Zhao Zhi—his other nephew—to discuss the matter. Before leaving, he instructed his wife to keep a close watch on Zhao Ren.

    (3) Zhao Zhi is Zhao Ren's younger brother and a worker at the Binxing Printing Factory. That day, he was very surprised to hear from his uncle that his brother had come to Tianjin early in the morning, so he hurried to his uncle's house to see Zhao Ren. Zhao Ren told him the same story he had told Wang Xiru. Zhao Zhi listened and advised him to go back and confess everything to the government honestly. Zhao Ren didn't say anything for a long time, and finally said, "You don't understand, I can't go back, if I go back I'll lose my life!" This sentence stunned Zhao Zhi, he thought: his brother's matter must not be so simple.

    “老鼠过街，人人喊打”
    赵志方　苗地　画
    （一）王锡儒是天津私营斌兴印刷厂的营业员，去年十二月十八日清早，正要送孩子去上学，刚一开街门，一个人慌慌张张从外面走进来，帽子压得很低，口罩遮住了半个脸；看了半天，才认出是外甥赵仁。他觉得奇怪：从武清县老家到天津有五六十里路，赵仁一定是夜里就动身了，到底有什么要紧的事呢？
    （二）赵仁说话吞吞吐吐地告诉他舅舅说，村里有人偷了合作社的棉花，托他卖过。现在偷棉花的人犯了案，他害怕连累自己，因此来天津躲躲。王锡儒想：这里面一定有文章。因为一时问不出什么来，他就想先送孩子上了学，再去找赵智——他另外一个外甥去商量这事。临去的时候，他嘱咐妻子要好好看住赵仁。
    （三）赵智是赵仁的弟弟，是斌兴印刷厂的工人。这天，他听舅舅说哥哥一早就到天津来了，很是惊讶，就赶紧到舅舅家里来看赵仁。赵仁就照向王锡儒谈的那一套向他弟弟谈了一番。赵智听了，劝他回去向政府坦白地交代一切。赵仁半天没言语，最后说了一句：“你不知道，我不能回去，回去就没命了！”这句话，使赵智愣了一下，他想：哥哥的事情一定不是这么简单。
