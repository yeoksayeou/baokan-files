In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in Hubei Province's provincial organs, the movement has initially unfolded and has now entered the stage of democratic examination. The progress of the movement in various organs can be roughly divided into two types. First: the leadership combines with the masses, the head takes responsibility and takes the lead in criticism and self-criticism, mobilizing Party members and non-Party personnel to work together to conduct inspections. For example, the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and the Cultural Troupe of the Culture and Education Department have, as a result of doing so, strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses, and between superiors and subordinates. Everyone united to expose facts of corruption and waste. Second: some leading cadres lack the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. After the masses have initially moved and exposed their shortcomings, they adopt the means of attacking and suppressing for the sake of their personal so-called "face" and "prestige". For example, after the service personnel of the Personnel Department exposed the corruption and waste of Secretary Lin Xin, Lin Xin found the person who made the suggestion and threatened, "I am an old cadre of more than ten years, how many days have you been working? You have to be careful!" He Dinghua, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, although he also expressed "acceptance" of the opinions raised by the masses and also conducted "self-examination" and "explanation", he also criticized the comrades who made the suggestions as having "petty-bourgeois fanaticism", warning those who made the suggestions: "Don't be happy for a while." This aroused dissatisfaction among the masses and affected the normal progress of the movement.

The Hubei Provincial Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy proposed that those who suppress democracy and suppress criticism should be given appropriate punishment according to the seriousness of the circumstances. At present, the Personnel Department has suspended Lin Xin's administrative work, and the Party has also removed her from the post of branch committee member. (Hubei Daily)

    在反贪污反浪费运动中
    林欣压制批评受到处分
    湖北省级机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已初步展开，现已进入民主检查阶段。各机关运动的进展情形，大体可分为两种类型。第一种：领导和群众相结合，首长负责并带头进行批评和自我批评，启发动员党内党外工作人员一齐动手，共同进行检查。如湖北省水利局、文教厅文工队，这样做的结果，密切了党和群众、上级和下级的关系，大家团结一致，揭发了贪污浪费等事实。第二种：部分领导干部缺乏批评和自我批评的精神。当群众已经初步动起来、揭发了他们的缺点之后，他们为了个人的所谓“面子”、“威信”，而采取了打击、压制的手段。如人事厅的勤务人员揭发了秘书林欣的贪污浪费行为之后，林欣竟找到提意见的人，威胁说：“我是十几年的老干部，你参加工作才几天？可得小心些！”中共湖北省委统战部副部长何定华，对于群众提出的意见，虽也表示“接受”，也进行了“检讨”、“解释”，但同时批评提意见的同志是“小资产阶级的狂热病”，警告提意见的人：“不要逞一时之快。”引起群众不满，影响了运动的正常进展。
    湖北省增产节约运动委员会对于压制民主、压制批评的分子，提出应按情节轻重给以适当处分。目前，人事厅已停止林欣的行政工作，党内也撤销了她的支部委员的工作。（湖北日报）
