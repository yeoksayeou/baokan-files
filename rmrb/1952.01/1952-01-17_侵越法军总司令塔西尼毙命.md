    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Paris: Tassigny, the French High Commissioner to Indochina and Commander-in-Chief of the French Far East Forces, who commanded the French invading army in slaughtering the Vietnamese people, died in Paris on the evening of January 11. He was sent to command France's war of aggression in Vietnam after the French invading army suffered a disastrous defeat on the North Vietnamese border in the autumn of 1950.
    Tassigny personally went to Washington in September last year to beg for American aid. After returning to Vietnam, in November he gathered twenty-three battalions to invade and occupy the provincial capital of Hoa Binh Province. This military adventure has now met with a shameful failure.

    侵越法军总司令塔西尼毙命
    【新华社讯】巴黎消息：指挥法国侵略军屠杀越南人民的法国驻印度支那高级专员兼法国驻远东军总司令塔西尼，已于一月十一日晚在巴黎病死。他是在一九五零年秋季法国侵略军在北越边境遭受惨败以后，被派去指挥法国在越南的侵略战争的。
    塔西尼在去年九月间曾亲赴华盛顿乞求美国援助，他回到越南以后，在十一月间纠集了二十三个营的兵力侵占和平省省会，这一军事冒险现已遭到可耻的失败。
