Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Following the talks between Truman and Churchill, the United States, Britain, and France held a secret meeting of their Chiefs of Staff in Washington on January 11th to discuss a joint plan for expanding the imperialist bloc's aggressive actions in Southeast Asia. In addition to the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, British Imperial Chief of the General Staff Shilling, and French Inspector General of Armed Forces Juin, observers from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand also attended the meeting.

Regarding the purpose of this meeting, according to an Associated Press dispatch from London on the 10th, it was to implement certain suggestions passed at the military conference held by the United States, Britain, and France in Singapore in May of last year. These suggestions included: (1) exchanging intelligence and technical knowledge to assist the "anti-communist movement"; (2) building Singapore into a major military base for the entire (Southeast Asia) region; and (3) establishing a joint Southeast Asian command with naval, land, and air force reserves. If one links this aggressive plan of the US, British, and French imperialists with the French reactionaries' clamor to "internationalize" the war of aggression against Vietnam, then the imperialist bloc's conspiracy to expand aggression in Southeast Asia is fully exposed.

However, the vast distance between the US, British, and French imperialist bloc's arrogant aggressive ambitions and their meager strength doomed this meeting to failure. The US imperialists, having suffered severe punishment from the Korean and Chinese People's Armies in the war of aggression against Korea, no longer have much strength to save Britain and France from the failures they are suffering in Malaya and Indochina. At this meeting, although France vigorously emphasized its critical position in Vietnam and Britain vigorously emphasized its difficult situation in Malaya and elsewhere, begging the United States for greater assistance, the US military leaders "shuddered at the thought of sending ground troops to participate in any 'local war' like the one in Korea" (United Press), and therefore could not answer the requests of its British and French partners. Under these circumstances, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on the 12th, US officials admitted that this meeting of the three Chiefs of Staff "did not make any decisions," and the French Inspector General of Armed Forces Juin, who flew to the United States with great hope for assistance, "did not receive any guarantees" (United Press) as to whether he could obtain more US aid. Thus, the meeting of the three Chiefs of Staff ended hastily in failure within a day.

    美英法参谋长会议失败
    美国侵朝战争遭到严重惩罚无力挽救英法在东南亚的失败
    【新华社十八日讯】继杜鲁门和邱吉尔会谈之后，美、英、法三国又在一月十一日在华盛顿举行三国参谋长秘密会议，讨论帝国主义集团在东南亚扩大侵略行动的联合计划。参加会议的除美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷、英帝国参谋总长史陵和法国武装部队总监许温以外，还有加拿大、澳大利亚和新西兰的观察员。
    关于这次会议的目的，据美联社伦敦十日电透露，是为了实现去年五月间美、英、法三国在新加坡举行的军事会议所通过的若干建议。这些建议包括：（一）交换情报及技术知识以协助“反共运动”；（二）把新加坡建设为整个（东南亚）地区的主要军事基地；（三）建立一个东南亚联合司令部，拥有海陆空军的后备力量。如果人们把美、英、法帝国主义者的这个侵略计划和法国反动派关于要把侵越战争“国际化”的叫嚣联系起来，那么，帝国主义集团企图在东南亚扩大侵略的阴谋，就完全暴露出来了。
    但是，美、英、法帝国主义集团的狂妄侵略野心和他们的微薄力量之间的巨大距离，注定了这次会议失败的命运。美帝国主义者因为在侵朝战争中遭到朝中人民军队的严重惩罚，已没有多大力量可以挽救英法两国在马来亚和印度支那所遭到的失败。在这次会议中，虽然法国竭力强调它在越南的危急地位，英国竭力强调它在马来亚等地的困难情况，乞求美国给以更大的援助，但由于美国军事首脑 “一想到派遣地面部队参与任何像在朝鲜那样的‘局部战争’就不寒而栗”（合众社），因而无法答复它的英法伙伴的要求。在这种情势下，据法新社华盛顿十二日电，美国官员承认，这次三国参谋长会议“并未作出任何决定”，而抱着很大希望飞美求援的法国武装部队总监许温，对于是否能得到美国更多的援助，亦“未获得任何保证”（合众社）。这样，三国参谋长会议就在一天之内以失败而草草结束。
