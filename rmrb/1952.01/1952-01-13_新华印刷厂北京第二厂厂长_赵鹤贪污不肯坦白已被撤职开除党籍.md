Xinhua Printing Factory Beijing Second Plant Director
Zhao He Embezzles, Refuses to Confess, Dismissed and Expelled from the Party

Zhao He, director of the Xinhua Printing Factory Beijing Second Plant, engaged in embezzlement. Not only did he refuse to confess and examine his mistakes, but he also adopted an attitude of resistance, seriously hindering the development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the factory. The General Administration of Xinhua Printing Factory announced Zhao He's dismissal from the post of factory director on January 3; the Party organization has decided to expel Zhao He from the Party.

After entering the city, Zhao He frequently associated with private merchants, was influenced by the corruption of the bourgeoisie, pursued enjoyment in life, and often accepted bribes from private merchants under the guise of "borrowing" and "gifting." He was indistinguishable from private merchants, and even allowed the Tongyi Binding Shop to hang a sign reading "Xinhua Printing Factory Beijing Second Plant Contracted Binding Shop." The work contracted by the factory to the Tongyi Binding Shop often failed to be delivered on time, and the binding quality was also poor. Zhao He also leaked state secrets. Therefore, it caused great political and property losses to the factory. After the Party organization learned of this situation, it repeatedly asked Zhao He to deeply examine his mistakes, but Zhao He consistently adopted a perfunctory attitude, only vaguely examining his "unstable political stance" and "ideological paralysis, allowing capitalists to take advantage," and refused to honestly reveal his embezzlement. Until December 27 last year, due to the Party's continuous education and the workers' accusations, Zhao He was forced to make a "self-criticism" at a factory-wide staff meeting, downplaying some minor issues. Regarding his own serious mistakes, he only lightly said: "Over time, this may develop into embezzlement." When workers accused him of accepting bribes, he irresponsibly said: "I don't think I need to explain, 'correct if true, encourage if not'." When a worker even questioned him about where his three watches came from, he said: "Why don't you ask where my children came from?" These things aroused great dissatisfaction among the factory staff. Worker Li Shijin said: "How can the leadership lead everyone if they do this?" They unanimously requested the higher authorities to deal with it promptly. The General Administration of Xinhua Printing Factory and the Third District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Beijing Municipality supported the masses' opinions and announced on January 3 the removal of Zhao He from his administrative post as factory director and his position as a member of the Party branch committee, and ordered him to make a profound self-criticism. Afterwards, Zhao He still showed no sign of remorse. The Third District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Beijing Municipality has decided to expel him from the Party, and has been approved by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

On January 3, after the factory's staff saw the announcement of Zhao He's dismissal from the post of factory director on the blackboard, they all expressed their warm support.

In the past, because Zhao He refused to honestly confess his embezzlement, it made some people in the factory who had been dishonest in the past even more unwilling to confess their mistakes; even individual embezzlers also adopted a dishonest attitude, wanting to "wait and see", thus affecting the normal development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. After Zhao He's dismissal, the situation changed. Meng Xiheng, a staff member of the factory, had three acts of embezzlement, which he had never confessed in the past, and originally wanted to "see how the wind blows before deciding." After Zhao He was dismissed, he rushed to write a confession overnight, and confessed the problem early the next morning, and expressed his determination to thoroughly correct his mistakes. In addition, some other people also successively confessed their problems.

### 新华印刷厂北京第二厂厂长  赵鹤贪污不肯坦白已被撤职开除党籍

    新华印刷厂北京第二厂厂长
    赵鹤贪污不肯坦白已被撤职开除党籍
    新华印刷厂北京第二厂厂长赵鹤有贪污行为。他不但不肯坦白和检讨自己的错误，还采取对抗态度，严重地妨碍了这个厂反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的开展。新华印刷厂总管理处已于一月三日宣布撤销赵鹤的厂长职务；党的组织已经决定开除赵鹤的党籍。
    赵鹤入城以后，常与私商来往，受到资产阶级腐化的影响，生活上追求享受，时常以“借”“送”等名义，接受私商贿赂。与私商彼此不分，竟允许私商同义装订所挂着“新华印刷厂北京第二厂特约装订所”的牌子。厂里包给同义装订所的活，经常不能按期交货，装订质量也很差。赵鹤并曾泄露国家机密。因此，带给厂里造成的政治、财产的损失是很大的。党组织知道这情况后，曾数次要赵鹤深刻检讨错误，可是赵鹤一贯采取敷衍态度，只空洞地检讨自己“政治立场不稳”，“思想麻痹，给资本家钻了空子”，而不肯老实地说出自己的贪污行为。直到去年十二月二十七日，由于党不断的教育和工人们的检举，赵鹤被迫在全厂职工大会上作了“检讨”，避重就轻地谈了一些细小问题。对他自己严重的错误，他只是轻描淡写地说：“这样天长日久，是可能发展成为贪污行为的。”工人们检举他的受贿事实时，他毫不负责任地说：“我看不用解释，‘有则改之，无则加勉’。”甚至有工人质问他三个手表是从那里来的时候，他说：“为什么不问我的小孩是从那来的？”这些事情引起了厂里职工很大的不满。工人李士锦说：“领导上这样做，怎么能带动大家呢？”他们一致要求上级迅速予以处理。新华印刷厂总管理处和中共北京市第三区委员会支持群众意见，已在一月三日宣布撤销赵鹤行政上厂长职务和党支部委员的职务，并令他做深刻的反省检讨。以后赵鹤仍然没有丝毫悔悟的表示。中共北京市第三区委员会已决定开除他的党籍，并已得到中共北京市委批准。
    一月三日，这个厂的职工在黑板上看到撤销赵鹤厂长职务的通告后，都表示热烈拥护。
    过去，因为赵鹤不肯先把自己的贪污行为，老老实实地坦白出来，这就使得厂内一些过去手脚不干净的人，更不愿坦白自己的错误了；甚至有个别贪污分子，也同样采取不老实的态度，想看“苗头”，因而影响到反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的正常开展。撤销赵鹤职务以后，情况有了改变。该厂职员孟熙恒有三次贪污行为，在过去一直没有坦白出来，原也想“看看风势再说”，在赵鹤被撤销职务以后，他连夜赶写坦白材料，第二天清早就把问题交代出来了，并表示要彻底改正错误。另外还有一些人也陆续坦白了自己的问题。
