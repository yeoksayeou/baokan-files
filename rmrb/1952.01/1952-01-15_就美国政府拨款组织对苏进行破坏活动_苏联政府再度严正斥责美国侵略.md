    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th: TASS reports: The Soviet Government previously sent a note to the U.S. Government on November 21, 1951, lodging a serious protest against the U.S. allocating 100 million U.S. dollars under the name of the "Mutual Security Act of 1951" to organize subversive and destructive activities against the Soviet Union, and demanded that the U.S. Government abolish the aforementioned law. On December 19, 1951, the U.S. Government replied to the Soviet Government, rejecting the Soviet demands and offering feeble justifications for U.S. actions. In response, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acting on the instructions of the Soviet Government, sent another note to the U.S. Government on January 9, sternly pointing out that the U.S. "Mutual Security Act of 1951" is an aggressive law. By passing this law, the U.S. Government has shamelessly violated its obligations under the Soviet-American Agreement of November 16, 1933. The U.S. Government's behavior is an act of aggression against the Soviet Union. The U.S. reply completely fails to deny this fact. Therefore, the Soviet Government believes it must once again declare that the U.S. Government should be held fully responsible for this action and resolutely demands that the U.S. Government abolish this law.

    In its note, the Soviet Government specifically pointed out: "The U.S. Government, in its reply, evaded the fact that the law passed by the United States stipulates the funding and arming of criminals and underground organizations in the territories of the Soviet Union and other countries in order to carry out subversive and destructive activities within these countries. The United States’ silence on this point is understandable, because the aforementioned activities stipulated by the 'Mutual Security Act of 1951' are direct interference by the U.S. Government in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union and expose the U.S. Government as an enemy of peace, a violator of its assumed obligations, and a destroyer of universally recognized norms of international law in relations between countries."

    就美国政府拨款组织对苏进行破坏活动
    苏联政府再度严正斥责美国侵略
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府前在一九五一年十一月二十一日曾照会美国政府，对美国在“一九五一年共同安全法”名下，拨款一亿美元，组织对苏联的颠覆与破坏活动一事提出严重抗议，并要求美国政府废除上项法律。一九五一年十二月十九日，美国政府复照苏联政府，拒绝了苏联的要求，并为美国的行为强辞辩解。为此，苏联外交部奉苏联政府训令，特于一月九日再度照会美国政府，严正指出美国的“一九五一年共同安全法”是一项侵略性的法律。美国政府通过这项法律，是厚颜无耻地违背了它根据一九三三年十一月十六日苏美协定应当承担的义务。美国政府的这种行为是对苏联的侵略行动。美国的复文完全无法否认这种事实。因此，苏联政府认为必须再度声明这种行动应该完全由美国政府负责，并坚决要求美国政府废除这项法律。
    苏联政府在照会中特别指出：“美国政府在其复文中避开了一件事实，即美国所通过的法律规定资助和武装在苏联和其他国家领土上的犯罪分子和地下组织，以便在这些国家内进行颠覆和破坏活动，这并不是偶然的。美国对于这一点保持缄默是很可以了解的，因为‘一九五一年共同安全法’所规定的上述活动，是美国政府对苏联内政的直接干涉，而且暴露了美国政府是和平的敌人，是它所承担的义务的违背者。它破坏了在国与国之间的关系上举世公认的国际法准则。”
