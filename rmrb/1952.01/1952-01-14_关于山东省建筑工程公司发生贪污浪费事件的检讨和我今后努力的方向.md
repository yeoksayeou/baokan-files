My Self-Criticism Regarding the Corruption and Waste Incident at Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company and My Future Efforts
Former Deputy Director of the Shandong Provincial People's Government Department of Industry Wang Jiwu

Since its establishment in May 1949, the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company has continuously experienced major errors such as serious rework and waste, corruption and embezzlement, and worker injuries and deaths. This is a very serious political problem. To examine the root causes of these errors in the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company, one should first start with the leadership of the Department of Industry, because these errors are inseparable from the leadership style of the Department of Industry, and especially closely related to my personal leadership style. Regarding these errors, in addition to requesting the organization to give me appropriate punishment, I make the following self-criticism:

I. I have a serious bureaucratic style of work. Specifically, I am ideologically and practically detached from the masses, unwilling to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and rely solely on personal subjective wishes, replacing policy with my own feelings. The issues of corruption, waste, rework penalties, and work-related injuries and deaths at the Construction Engineering Company have been reported by the masses for a long time and have been published in newspapers many times, but I have not paid attention to them, let alone delved into the situation to solve the problems. As a result, the problems continued to occur and eventually developed to a considerably serious degree.

II. I lack a clear understanding of relying on the working class and am indifferent to the lives of workers. Since the company's establishment, work-related injuries and deaths have occurred continuously. We, the leadership, have not paid attention to such important matters, let alone tried to prevent them, causing work-related injuries and deaths to continue to occur. For a staff member of the People's Government, especially for a Communist Party member, this erroneous thinking of ignoring the interests of workers and not caring about the lives of workers must be eradicated.

III. I have serious departmentalism characterized by a lack of an overall perspective and failure to consider the interests of the whole. When the company was first established, there was a shortage of technical personnel, so we resorted to unscrupulous means to attract technical personnel. For example, the Xuzhou Construction Branch attracted eight technical personnel from the Northeast Construction Engineering Company. We only dealt with this issue after the Northeast Construction Engineering Company filed a complaint with the Shandong Provincial People's Procuratorate. However, this had already caused losses in our work and created a negative impact. Another example is that the company recently wanted to establish a branch in Beijing, not for the purpose of developing business, but to recruit a batch of technical personnel in Beijing. This narrow departmentalism, which disregards the interests of the whole and only considers the interests of one's own unit, is very harmful to the Party and the work. I once had an erroneous idea about this, namely, that if we could attract more technical personnel, we could do more work. The continuous occurrence of high-priced purchases and attraction of technical personnel by the Construction Engineering Company was precisely influenced by my erroneous thinking.

IV. My class stance is not clear, and my political sense is not sharp. For example, when recruiting personnel, we did not distinguish between good and bad, and filled positions indiscriminately. We simply emphasized that "with cadres, we have strength; with technical personnel, we can complete tasks," believing that technical personnel were omnipotent, one-sidedly believing in technical personnel, and blindly worshiping technical personnel without principle, thereby promoting their backward consciousness and making them think that the Construction Engineering Company could not function without them. There was once an erroneous saying in the company: "The Construction Company relies on technical personnel for its livelihood."

V. I lack a high sense of responsibility to the Party and the people. Incidents of corruption, waste, and rework penalties at the Construction Engineering Company occurred very early and were quite serious. For example, the problem of corruption existed from the manager down to the car drivers, becoming a widespread phenomenon. We, the leading cadres, did not pay attention to this. Rework penalties also occurred frequently, some of which were very serious. In particular, the company recently handed over 600 million yuan to private merchants to purchase timber without signing a contract or providing security, resulting in the private merchants running away with the money. Because I lacked an active sense of responsibility to the Party and the people, I did not pay close attention to these matters, nor did I try to improve and prevent them.

VI. I have been severely eroded by bourgeois ideology. After the establishment of the Construction Engineering Company, we did not proceed from objective reality, but blindly expanded and blindly solicited bids. The company's development was not based on a steady and progressive approach, but on a mass movement approach,妄想(wàng xiǎng)妄想(wàng xiǎng)hoping to develop to the scale of the Qingdao State-owned Cotton Textile Factory in two or three years. The seriousness of the blind exaggeration can be seen from the business objectives in the company's advertising at that time. I also did not promptly correct the Construction Engineering Company's erroneous policy of "ensuring profit in materials," which fueled the company cadres' thinking of simply making money. The root of these problems is that we, the leading cadres, have capitalist ideas.

VII. I am seriously detached from the organization and the masses, and even stand above the Party organization to lead the work. Specifically, I fail to consult with the Party committee in a timely manner when things happen, relying on the Party's guarantee to do a good job. I do not listen to the reflections of Party members, and simply criticizing Party members is ineffective. The Party committee does not understand the administrative tasks of each period, so it cannot play a guaranteeing role. In this way, a coercive and commanding approach is simply adopted in the work. This separates the administrative leadership from the Party members, causes the relationship between the Party and the masses to be uncoordinated, affects the prestige of the Party, and makes the political mood of the entire company's personnel not high, which is very harmful to the work.

VIII. I lack a policy concept and have a vague understanding of cadre policy. For cadres, I only look at their temporary performance, rather than measuring them from a political essence. For example, regarding Chi Qi, I only thought that this cadre was "capable and resourceful" without analyzing him from an essential perspective, and sent him to work at the Construction Engineering Company. The company then sent him to the Northeast to purchase timber, which resulted in a major error. The promotion of cadres is also based solely on a person's temporary performance. For example, regarding the company's deputy general manager, Li Nianzhen, I did not analyze and understand him from the essence of his ideology, so that he could not be competent after being promoted.

In addition, my understanding of financial and economic policies is also vague. For example, I do not have a clear understanding of the company's business policy, and I am also unclear about the purpose of establishing a construction company. The ideas of blind development and simply making money are obvious examples.

Why did the above errors occur? The root causes are as follows:

I. I do not care about political study. Although I have been cultivated and educated by the Party for more than ten years, because I have not studied policies and theories well for a long time, my political and ideological development has been very slow. I am satisfied with the status quo, self-righteous, unwilling to accept new things, and accustomed to the old ways of working.

II. Because I grew up in a small-scale agricultural economy, my thinking still carries the backward conservatism of the handicraft industry. Sometimes I am overly cautious in dealing with problems, and sometimes my views on problems are still narrow and one-sided.

III. Long-term "independent" work has fostered self-righteous and ambitious ideas, which have developed to the point of disregarding the organization and disregarding discipline.

IV. Influenced by bourgeois ideology, I like to be extravagant and exaggerated.

V. I do not consider problems carefully, and I act blindly, failing to consider problems according to the laws of the development of things, which leads to blind optimism.

In order to learn from the above errors and do a good job in the future, I propose the following directions for efforts and opinions for correction:

I. Strengthen the study of policies and theories, improve ideological level, improve leadership methods, realize collective leadership, get rid of事務主義(shìwù zhǔyì) (taking care of administrative details to the neglect of principles and policies) and correct the one-sidedness of ideological methods.

II. Strengthen planning and foresight in work. When encountering problems, we must think deeply. We should consider and grasp the laws of development and consequences of problems, and establish the concept of "thinking three times before acting."

III. Regularly go deep into the masses to understand the situation, and humbly listen to the reflections of the masses. Pay attention to strengthening ideological leadership and political leadership, and overcome the bureaucratic leadership style.

IV. Establish an overall view that takes into account the overall situation and takes care of the whole, and overcome narrow departmentalism.

    关于山东省建筑工程公司发生贪污浪费事件的检讨和我今后努力的方向
    前山东省人民政府工业厅副厅长　王纪武
    山东省建筑工程公司自一九四九年五月成立至今，曾连续发生了严重的返工浪费、贪污舞弊、伤亡工人等重大错误。这是一个非常严重的政治问题。检查山东省建筑工程公司所发生的这些错误的根源，首先应从工业厅的领导方面着手，因为这些错误是和工业厅的领导作风分不开的，特别是和我个人的领导作风更有着极大关系。对于这些错误，我除请求组织上给我以适当的处分以外，并作如下检讨：
    一、我有严重的官僚主义作风。具体表现在思想上、工作上严重地脱离群众，不虚心听取群众的意见，单凭个人主观愿望，以自己的感想代替政策。建筑工程公司的贪污、浪费、返工被罚以及伤亡事故等问题，很早就有群众反映，并在报纸上登过多次，但我并没有重视，更没有深入了解情况，解决问题，因而问题连续发生，最后发展到相当严重的程度。
    二、我缺乏明确的依靠工人阶级的思想，对工人生命漠不关心。公司自成立至今，伤亡事故曾不断发生。我们领导方面对这样的大事，却没有重视，更没有想法制止，使伤亡事故连续发生。对一个人民政府工作人员来讲，特别是对一个共产党员来讲，这种漠视工人利益、不关心工人生命的错误思想，是必须肃清的。
    三、我有缺乏整体观念，不为整体利益着想的严重的本位主义思想。在公司成立当初，技术人员缺乏，就到处不择手段地拉技术人员。如徐州建筑分公司拉拢东北建筑工程公司的技术人员八人，直到东北建筑工程公司来山东省人民检察署控诉后，我们才处理了这一问题。但这已使工作上受到了损失，并造成了不良影响。又如最近公司想在北京设立分公司，目的不是为了发展业务，而是想在北京搜罗
    一批技术人员。这种不为整体利益只顾自己本单位着想的狭隘的本位主义，对党对工作的危害性是很大的。我对这种作法曾有一种错误的想法，即认为如能多拉到一些技术人员，就可以多作些工作。建筑工程公司高价收买和拉拢技术人员的事不断发生，正是受我的这种错误思想的影响。
    四、我的阶级立场不明确，政治嗅觉不灵敏。如在招用人员时，不管好坏，滥竽充数。单纯强调“有干部就有力量，有技术人员就能完成任务”，认为技术人员是万能的，片面地相信技术人员，对技术人员无原则地盲目崇拜，因而助长了他们的落后意识，使他们认为建筑工程公司没有他们就不行。公司中曾有过这样的一种错误说法：“建筑公司是吃的技术员的饭。”
    五、缺乏对党对人民高度负责的精神。建筑工程公司贪污、浪费、返工被罚等事件，很早就发生了，而且相当严重。如贪污问题，上自经理下至汽车驾驶员都有，已成为普遍现象。我们领导干部对这却没有注意。返工被罚的情事也层出不穷，有的并且非常严重。特别是最近公司曾把六亿元交给私商购买木料，没订合同，没有铺保，以致被私商骗走。我对于这些事情，因为缺乏对党对人民积极负责的精神，没有密切注意、设法改进和制止。
    六、我严重地受了资产阶级思想意识的侵蚀。建筑工程公司成立后，不从客观现实出发，盲目扩大，盲目招标。公司的发展不是采取稳步前进的办法，而是大呼隆的方式，妄想在两三年内发展到青岛国营棉纺织厂那样大的规模。从公司当时的广告中的营业要目中，即可看出盲目夸大的严重性。建筑工程公司提出“工程保本，材料赚钱”的错误方针时，我也没有及时纠正，以致助长了公司干部单纯赚钱的思想。这些问题的根源，是由于我们领导干部中有着资本主义思想。
    七、我严重地脱离组织、脱离群众，甚至站在党组织之上来领导工作。具体表现在有事不能和党委及时商讨，依靠党的保证来作好工作。不倾听党员的反映，单纯批评党员不起作用。党委不了解每一时期的行政任务，也就没法起保证作用。这样，在工作中就单纯地采用了强迫命令的方式。这样就使得行政领导方面和党员脱离，党群关系不协调，党的威信受到影响，整个公司人员的政治情绪不高，对工作的损害也是非常大的。
    八、我缺乏政策观念，对干部政策认识模糊。对于干部，只是看他一时的表现，而不是从政治本质上来衡量。如对迟岐，我只认为这个干部“能干，有办法”，而没有从本质上去分析他，就派他去建筑工程公司工作；公司又派他去东北购买木料，结果发生了很大的错误。提拔干部也是只看这个人一时的表现。如对公司副总经理李念珍，没有从他的思想本质上去分析、认识，以致提拔后不能胜任。
    另外，对财经政策的认识也是模糊的。如对公司的业务方针没有明确的认识，成立建筑公司的目的是什么，也不明确。盲目发展和单纯赚钱的思想就是很明显的例子。
    为什么会发生以上错误呢？根源有以下几点：
    一、不关心政治学习。虽然经过党十多年的培养教育，但由于自己长时期没有很好地学习政策理论，政治思想开展很慢，满足于现状，自以为是，不接受新鲜事物，习惯于老一套的工作作风。
    二、因为自己从小生长在小农经济的社会环境中，思想上还带有手工业方式的落后保守性，有时对问题的处理谨慎过度，有时对问题的看法还狭隘片面。
    三、长期“独立”工作，养成自以为是和好高骛远的思想，以致发展到目无组织，目无纪律。
    四、受资产阶级思想的影响，欢喜铺张、夸大。
    五、考虑问题不周密，盲目行事，不能根据事物发展的规律考虑问题，以致产生盲目的乐观情绪。
    为接受以上错误的教训，作好今后的工作，我提出努力方向和改正的意见如下：
    一、加强政策理论学习，提高思想水平，改进领导方法，实现集体领导，摆脱事务主义，改正思想方法的片面性。
    二、加强工作上的计划性和预见性。遇到问题要深思熟虑，对问题应考虑和掌握它的发展规律和后果，树立“三思而后行”的观念。
    三、经常深入群众了解情况，虚心倾听群众反映。注意加强思想领导和政治领导，克服官僚主义的领导作风。
    四、树立顾全大局，照顾整体的整体观念，克服狭隘的本位主义思想。
