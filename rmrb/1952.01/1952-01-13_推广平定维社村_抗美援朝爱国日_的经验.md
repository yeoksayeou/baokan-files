    Promote the Experience of "Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Day" in Weishe Village, Pingding

    The "Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Day" (hereinafter referred to as "Patriotic Day") created by the people of Weishe Village, Pingding, Shanxi, like the "Resist America, Aid Korea Day" of the Ninth Police Station of the Second District of Beijing introduced in this journal before, is a good guarantee for the people to realize the patriotic pact. The activities of the "Patriotic Day" held by the people of Weishe Village have been valued by the leading organs of Shanxi Province and have begun to be promoted throughout the province. It also provides good experience for promoting the patriotic pact movement throughout the country.

    Using the form of "Patriotic Day" to check and revise the patriotic pact can extensively attract and mobilize all the people to participate in the activities of the patriotic pact, so that the patriotic pact truly becomes a conscious collective matter of the people. As everyone knows, more than half of the population in the country has now signed patriotic pacts, but a large part of them have the problem of formalism. There is no doubt that the key to overcoming formalism is to continue to fully carry out patriotic ideological education among the people, and one of the best ways to carry out this education is to strengthen the inspection of patriotic pacts, especially to mobilize frequent mutual inspections among the masses. The activities of the "Patriotic Day" in Weishe Village vividly organized all the people together, achieving the purpose of everyone checking and revising the patriotic pact, which is very helpful to encourage and stimulate the patriotic enthusiasm of the people. On the "Patriotic Day" activities, which family or group's patriotic pact has been realized, which family or group's patriotic pact has not been realized or not fully realized, comparing families and groups, so that the advanced are commended, and the backward are criticized, forming a patriotic revolutionary competition among the people to realize the patriotic pact. In this way, the patriotic pact is completely based on the conscious foundation of the people, and the "Patriotic Day" becomes a large classroom for the people to collectively check the patriotic pact and conduct self-education, and the phenomenon of paternalistic substitution in the leadership work of the patriotic pact can also be overcome.

    Since the activities of "Patriotic Day" are regular and frequent, the inspection and revision of the patriotic pact can also become a regular and periodic system. In the past, the patriotic pacts in some places could not be checked and revised in time, thus deviating from the current struggle; in some places, because the people's patriotic consciousness continued to improve, what they could do had exceeded the content of the original patriotic pact, so the patriotic pact lost its due role. However, the creation of the "Patriotic Day" in Weishe Village solved these problems. It enriches the content of the patriotic pact with the current political tasks and the development of the people's own work, study, and life, thereby continuously improving the people's political consciousness and promoting various tasks. In this way, the patriotic pact can truly become a fighting and effective action program for the people.

    Another important role of the "Patriotic Day" of the people in Weishe Village, Pingding, Shanxi and the Ninth Police Station of the Second District of Beijing is that through this meeting format, the publicity of current affairs and politics among the residents can be regularized. This is one of the important reasons why the form of "Patriotic Day" must be gradually promoted. The experience of "Patriotic Day" also proves that if all the activities of the Communist Party's propaganda network and mass propaganda team members can be carried out around the "Patriotic Day," this will not only make the content of the "Patriotic Day" more vivid, but especially enrich the work of the propaganda network, and regular patriotic education will be possible. Establishing "Patriotic Day" can also save the people's time. When universally checking patriotic pacts, all factories, rural areas, streets, organs, and schools should actively promote the activities of "Patriotic Day" according to their own conditions, so that the patriotic pact can further play its great political role.

### 推广平定维社村“抗美援朝爱国日”的经验

    推广平定维社村“抗美援朝爱国日”的经验
    山西平定维社村人民所创造的“抗美援朝爱国日”（以下简称“爱国日”），和本刊以前介绍过的北京市第二区第九派出所的“抗美援朝日”一样，是人民群众实现爱国公约的一种很好的保证。维社村人民举办“爱国日”的活动已经受到山西省领导机关的重视，并已开始在全省推广。它对于推进全国各地的爱国公约运动，也提供了良好的经验。
    用“爱国日”的形式检查和修订爱国公约，能够十分广泛地吸引和发动全体人民群众来参加爱国公约的活动，使爱国公约真正成为人民群众自觉的集体的事情。大家知道，全国现在有半数以上的人口已经订立了爱国公约，但其中有很大一部分存在着形式主义的毛病。毫无疑问，克服形式主义的关键是继续不断地在人民群众中充分地进行爱国主义的思想教育，而进行这种教育的最好方式之一，就是加强对于爱国公约的检查，特别是发动群众之间经常的相互检查。维社村的“爱国日”的活动把全体人民群众活泼地组织在一起，达到了大家都来动手检查修订爱国公约的目的，这对于鼓舞和激发人民群众的爱国主义热情很有帮助。在“爱国日”的活动上，那家或那个组的爱国公约实现了，那家或那个组的爱国公约没有实现或没有完全实现，家和家比较，组和组比较，使先进的受到表扬，落后的受到批评，把实现爱国公约，在人民群众中形成爱国的革命比赛。这样，爱国公约就完全建立在人民群众自觉的基础上，“爱国日”则成为人民群众自己集体检查爱国公约和进行自我教育的大课堂，爱国公约领导工作上的包办代替的现象也就能够克服。
    由于“爱国日”的活动是定期的、经常的，这样就使检查修订爱国公约也能成为一种经常的定期的制度。过去，有的地方的爱国公约不能及时地检查和修订，因而脱离了当前的斗争；有的地方因为人民群众爱国觉悟不断提高，他们所能做的已经超过了原订的爱国公约的内容，于是爱国公约失去了应有的作用。但维社村“爱国日”的创造，就解决了这些问题。它使爱国公约的内容随着当前的政治任务和人民群众自己的工作、学习、生活的发展而丰富起来，从而不断地提高人民群众的政治觉悟，推进各种工作。这样，就使爱国公约真正能够成为人民群众的一种战斗的有效的行动纲领。
    山西平定维社村和北京二区第九派出所的人民群众的“爱国日”的另一个重大作用，就是通过这种会议形式，可以使居民群众中的时事政治宣传经常化。这就是“爱国日”的形式必须予以逐步推广的重要理由之一。“爱国日”的经验同时证明：共产党的宣传网和群众宣传队员的一切活动，如果能够围绕“爱国日”进行工作，这不但会使“爱国日”的内容更加生动，特别会使宣传网的工作丰富起来，经常的爱国主义教育也就有了可能。建立“爱国日”同时还能节省人民群众的时间。各地在普遍检查爱国公约的时候，一切工厂、农村、街道、机关和学校，都应该根据自己的条件，积极地推广
    “爱国日”的活动，以使爱国公约进一步地能发挥它的伟大的政治作用。
