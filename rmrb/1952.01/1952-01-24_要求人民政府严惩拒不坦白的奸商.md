    Demand that the People's Government Severely Punish Unrepentant Dishonest Merchants
    The People of Mentougou Hate the Dishonest Merchant Liu Yuanjing
    Editor: After seeing the news that dishonest merchants like Liu Yuanjing had been arrested, we (Mentougou Cultural Center of Beijing) immediately organized a mass meeting in Mentougou to discuss this matter. Participants included cadres, workers, shop assistants, peddlers, teachers of people's schools, industrialists and merchants, and members of reading groups, totaling more than seventy people. Everyone unanimously supported the People's Government's measure of arresting criminals like Liu Yuanjing. Everyone expressed extreme hatred for these dishonest merchants and demanded that the People's Government severely punish them. Everyone also expressed their determination to join this struggle. Yao Jingwen, a shop assistant at Yongshengxiang Store, said: "Dishonest merchants like Liu Yuanjing, who are so vile and shamelessly steal state property and endanger the construction of the motherland, are everywhere. We shop assistants must use all sorts of methods to expose the dishonest merchants who refuse to confess." Industrialists and merchants such as Qiao Zhenting stated that they would further and more deeply carry out the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-tax avoidance movement in industrial and commercial circles.

    Unrepentant Dishonest Merchants Cannot Escape the Net of Justice
    Editor: From the case of dishonest merchants like Liu Yuanjing stealing state property, I realized how despicable dishonest merchants play tricks, exploit loopholes, and do bad things to harm the country. After liberation, Liu Yuanjing pretended to be progressive and became the chairman of the Beijing Construction Industry Association, an executive member of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, and a representative to the Beijing People's Representative Conference. During this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Liu Yuanjing also pretended to be active and played a deceptive trick of crying "Stop thief!" to divert suspicion from himself. In the end, Liu Yuanjing still could not escape the people's net of justice. The facts prove that Liu Yuanjing's two dirty hands of theft cannot cover the people's bright eyes. Other dishonest merchants, if they do not confess, will meet the same fate as Liu Yuanjing. Wang Shuyi

    News of the Volunteer Army Practicing Economy Deepened Our Hatred for Dishonest Merchants
    Editor: The news that Beijing's dishonest merchants Liu Yuanjing, Li Shanchang, and others stole more than 8 billion yuan of state property aroused our great indignation. This incident made us more deeply realize the great significance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign.

    On the same day's newspaper, we also saw that our most beloved people—the Volunteer Army comrades—in such a difficult war environment, were still actively and enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's call and launching a conservation movement. They also proposed many ways to save.

    This is a very clear contrast. From this, our hatred for these dishonest merchants is deepened even further. They seriously damaged the interests of the motherland. We demand that the government severely punish them.

    要求人民政府严惩拒不坦白的奸商
    门头沟群众痛恨奸商刘元敬
    编辑同志：看到奸商刘元敬等被捕的消息，我们（北京市门头沟文化馆）立即组织了一次门头沟的群众座谈会，讨论这件事情。参加座谈会的有干部、工人、店员、摊贩、民校教师、工商业者和读报组员，共七十多人。大家一致拥护人民政府逮捕刘元敬等犯的措施。大家对这些奸商，表示万分痛恨，要求人民政府严厉惩办他们。大家并且表示决心投入这一斗争。永生祥店员姚景文说：“像刘元敬这样卑鄙无耻、盗骗国家财产、危害祖国建设的奸商，到处都有。我们店员要用种种办法来检举拒不坦白的奸商。”工商业者乔振廷等表示，要在工商界中更深入开展反行贿、反偷税漏税等运动。

    拒不坦白的奸商难逃法网
    编辑同志：从奸商刘元敬等盗骗国家财产案，我认识了卑鄙的奸商是怎样地玩花样、钻空子，干损害国家的坏事。解放后，刘元敬伪装进步，当了北京市营造业公会的主任委员、北京市工商业联合会的执行委员和北京市各界人民代表会议的代表。在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，刘元敬还假装积极，玩了一套贼喊捉贼的欺骗手法。结果，刘元敬还是逃不出人民的法网。事实证明，刘元敬的两只盗骗的污手是遮不住人民雪亮的眼睛的。其他奸商如不坦白，也会得到和刘元敬一样的下场。　王树义
    志愿军实行节约的消息，加深了我们对奸商的仇恨
    编辑同志：北京市奸商刘元敬、李善长等盗窃国家财产八十多亿元的消息，引起我们极大的愤慨。这件事使我们更深刻地体会到反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的重大意义。
    在同一天的报纸上，我们又看到了我们最可爱的人——志愿军同志，他们在那样艰苦的战争环境下，还积极、热情地响应毛主席号召，展开节约运动。他们还提出很多节约办法。
    这是很明显的对比。从这里更加深了我们对这些奸商的仇恨。他们严重地损害了祖国的利益。我们要求政府严厉惩办他们。
