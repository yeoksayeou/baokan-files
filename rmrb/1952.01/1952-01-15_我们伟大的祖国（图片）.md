Our Great Motherland

The "Dabairen" sunflower seeds of Huailai County, Chahar Province, are a nationally renowned specialty. They can be used to extract oil, which has great industrial applications. Last year, with the support of the People's Government, farmers throughout the county planted 60,000 mu, with an output exceeding ten times that of the previous year. The picture shows the farmers of Xiyulin and other villages in the county, responding to the government's call and storing large quantities of sunflower seeds for the state.
