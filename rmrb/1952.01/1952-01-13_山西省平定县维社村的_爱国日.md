The "Patriotic Day" in Weishe Village, Pingle County, Shanxi Province
Zhang Guangcheng, Song Qing, Fu Zhang, Yuan Xian, Er He
    In Weishe Village, Pingle County, Shanxi Province, the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month are the happiest days for everyone. On that day, all the men and women in the village eat dinner early, and the children even change into clean clothes and gather together, singing and dancing, to celebrate "Patriotic Day."
    The full name of "Patriotic Day" is "Resist-America, Aid-Korea Patriotic Day." It is the day when the village propagandists conduct patriotic propaganda and education for everyone, and also the day when everyone checks and revises the patriotic pact. The "Patriotic Day" activities in Weishe Village have become a guarantee for the masses in the village to implement the patriotic pact and promote various tasks in the village.
    The entire village of Weishe and many groups and families had formulated patriotic pacts before the "May Day" holiday last year, but the pacts were nominally in place at the beginning, but did not play a role. Some people said, "We don't know why we made this! It's like drinking water with chopsticks, it's useless." After the implementation of the "Patriotic Day" system in August, they checked and revised the patriotic pact every half month, and the patriotic pact truly became everyone's concrete action program for patriotism. For example, at the "Patriotic Day" meeting held in early November, after deliberation and discussion by the masses of the village, two articles that had already been realized in the patriotic pact were removed (plowing the land one more time and expanding the wheat field by 200 mu); three new articles were added: "Composting stubble," "Leaving no stubble land uncultivated" (that is, all land that should be cultivated in autumn should be cultivated), "Delivering public grain must be new, clean, dry, and full." By the end of the month, after inspection, 90 households in the village had accumulated 160 manure piles (an average of 30 loads per pile). Of the more than 1,470 mu of land that should have been cultivated in the autumn, only 4 mu remained uncultivated (more than 100 mu were not cultivated in 1950). The entire village delivered 30,000 catties of public grain within two hours after the start of collection (in 1950, it took seven or eight days to deliver 12,000 catties). The quality of the grain delivered was also good (only two households had 218 catties of bad grain), which was praised by the staff of the Yangquan public grain warehouse. When delivering public grain, nine households whose own grain was not dry enough automatically exchanged other agricultural products for 1,800 catties of good grain from the masses in the village to hand in.
    Because everyone attached such importance to the implementation of the patriotic pact, Weishe Village has been transformed from a backward village into an advanced village. In addition to the achievements in production, other tasks have also been done well. For example, after the masses in the village discussed the need to "be prepared to respond to the call of the motherland anytime, anywhere" on "Patriotic Day," more than 80 young people signed up to join the army. The young people who signed up were always ready to listen to the call of the motherland. When they went to work in other places, they first left their mailing addresses with the village government. They said, "Whenever the motherland needs me, I will come back to join the army." The work of giving preferential treatment to military families in the village is also well done. The land of nine military families enjoying substitute farming has all been "contracted for production" or "contracted for cultivation." The masses of the village stipulated that they would collectively write a letter to the volunteers in Korea every three months, reporting on the preferential treatment work. Now they have established contact with a certain regiment of volunteers. The regiment headquarters wrote to them and said, "Your letters have encouraged all the soldiers in our regiment. You have done very good political work for us in the rear."
    Recently, the masses of the entire village responded to the call to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy at the "Patriotic Day" meeting. Seventy-six full and semi-laborers and 80% of the livestock in the village have been organized to engage in winter sideline production, earning 6.99 million yuan and 2,120 catties of millet in half a month. There have also been achievements in saving. The phenomenon of extravagant eating and drinking that originally existed in the village has begun to be corrected.
    The "Patriotic Day" activities in Weishe Village are led by the village branch of the Chinese Communist Party and presided over by the party's propagandists. The village's propaganda network is relatively sound. The propagandists have implemented a "contract propaganda system" of each person contacting ten households of the masses. Three days before "Patriotic Day," the propagandists go to all the masses they contact to understand the situation, check the implementation of the patriotic pact by everyone, and understand the demands and ideological situation of the masses, and then report to the branch. After research, the branch holds a propagandist meeting to determine the main content of the next "Patriotic Day" activity and write it on the blackboard newspaper. This time the blackboard newspaper was written with red chalk. When the masses saw that the blackboard newspaper had changed to red letters, they knew that "Patriotic Day" was coming. Everyone paid attention and started preparing.
    The "Patriotic Day" gathering is held in the evening. A courtyard with a large house is chosen as the venue. The national flag and a portrait of Chairman Mao are hung in the venue, kerosene lamps are lit, and the three characters "Patriotic Day" and some slogans are written, decorated like a festival. Before the meeting, the village's "entertainment team" beats gongs and drums and performs some allegro and short plays (without makeup). People laugh, jump, and clap their hands. When everyone arrives, the main responsible cadres of the village preside over the meeting, briefly talk about current affairs and the work of the village, point out the things to pay attention to when checking the patriotic pact this time, and ask everyone to discuss the main work for the next half month. Then everyone discusses and checks separately in residential groups. After individual and group checks, the patriotic pact of the entire village is checked collectively. Attention is paid to commendation and criticism at both large and small meetings. For example, at the "Patriotic Day" gathering held in late October, Liu Siyi of the village was commended for conscientiously implementing his patriotic pact. At another "Patriotic Day" gathering, Guo Jincheng of the village was strictly criticized by everyone for handing in bad grain during the autumn levy.
    Because everyone is prepared in advance and it has become a habit, such meetings are held very quickly and can be concluded in just two or three hours.
    Through the activities of "Patriotic Day," Weishe Village has closely linked the movement of the patriotic pact with the main tasks of the village. The cadres and masses of the village said, "Making a good patriotic pact and celebrating 'Patriotic Day' is really more powerful than having a county and district cadre's leadership often." Of the 200-odd households in the village, at least 200 people participate in each "Patriotic Day" gathering. Ge Xinglai of the village said, "In the past, I burned incense and worshipped Buddha, carrying coal and selling burned earth every day, but I couldn't make ends meet. Now I have more than ten mu of land and a donkey, and I earn a dou of rice every day by engaging in sideline production. Life is getting happier and happier. This 'Patriotic Day' is really a happy day." A farmer in the village, Liu Zhi, is illiterate and cannot understand the blackboard newspaper. He said, "I do things based on this 'Patriotic Day,' otherwise I would be bored to death. How are things at home and abroad? How should I love the country? What should I do? Who is good and who is bad in the village? I understand everything on this day, it's really great!" Many people believe that celebrating "Patriotic Day" reduces the number of meetings, reduces the waste of work, and gets more things done.
    Now, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed to promote the "Patriotic Day" system in Weishe Village in the 1952 propaganda network work plan. It is planned that before the "May Day" holiday, one-third of the urban and rural branches in the province will strive to hold "Patriotic Day"; it will be promoted to the entire province before October 1st.

    山西省平定县维社村的“爱国日”
    张光成、松青、富章、原贤、二和
    在山西省平定县的维社村，每逢旧历初一、十五，是大家最高兴的日子。那一天，村里男男女女都早早地吃了晚饭，小孩们还换上一套干净的衣服，跳着唱着集合到一起去过“爱国日”。
    “爱国日”的全名叫“抗美援朝爱国日”，是村里的宣传员向大家进行爱国主义宣传教育的一天，也是大家检查修订爱国公约的一天。维社村“爱国日”的活动，成为本村群众实现爱国公约，推进村里各种工作的一种保证。
    维社村全村和许多小组、家庭，在去年“五一”节以前就订立了爱国公约，但公约在开头是有名无实，不起作用的。有的人说：“咱就不知道订这做甚哩！真正喝水拿筷，一点用也没有。”八月份起，实行了“爱国日”制度后，他们把爱国公约每半月检查修订一次，爱国公约就真正成为大家爱国的具体行动纲领了。例如在十一月上旬举行的“爱国日”会议上，经过全村群众的酝酿讨论，去掉了爱国公约里已经实现了的两条（多锄一遍地和扩大麦地二百亩）；添进了三条新的：“将茬子沤肥”，“不留一亩茬地”（即应该秋耕的地全部秋耕），
    “交公粮要新、净、干、饱”。到月底检查，全村有九十户积肥一百六十囤
    （每囤平均三十担）。一千四百七十多亩应该秋耕的土地，只剩四亩没有耕了
    （一九五○年有一百多亩没有耕）。全村公粮在开征后两点钟内就交齐了三万斤（一九五○年交公粮时，七、八天才交完一万二千斤）。交的粮食质量也好
    （只有两户有二百十八斤粮食不好），受到了阳泉公粮仓库管理人员的表扬。交公粮时，有九户自己的粮食不够干，就自动拿别的农产品向村里群众换来好粮一千八百斤交去。
    因为大家这样重视执行爱国公约，维社村由一个工作落后的村变成先进村了。除了生产上的成绩外，别的工作也做得好。例如，全村群众在“爱国日”讨论了要“准备随时随地响应祖国的召唤”之后，就有八十多名青年报名参军。报了名的青年都随时准备听候祖国的召唤，他们到外地去干活时，都先到村政府留下通讯地址。他们说：“祖国啥时候要我，我就回来入伍。”村里的优抚工作也做得好。九户享受代耕的军属的土地，都实行了“包产”或“包耕”。全村群众规定每三个月集体给在朝鲜的志愿军写一次信，报告优抚工作情形。现在他们已经和志愿军某团建立了通讯联系。团部来信告诉他们说：“你们的来信，鼓舞了我们全团的战士。你们在后方给我们做了很好的政治工作。”
    最近，全村群众又在“爱国日”会议上响应了开展增产节约运动的号召。村里七十六个全劳动力和半劳动力以及百分之八十的牲口，都组织起来搞冬季副业生产，在半个月内就赚了人民币六百九十九万元和小米二千一百二十斤。节约方面也有了成绩，村里原来存在的大吃大喝现象已开始纠正。
    维社村的“爱国日”活动，是由村里的中国共产党支部领导，党的宣传员主持的。村里的宣传网组织比较健全。宣传员们实行了每人联系十户群众的
    “包干宣传制”。“爱国日”的前三天，宣传员们就到所有自己联系的群众那里去了解情况，检查大家执行爱国公约的情形，并了解群众的要求和思想情况，然后向支部汇报。支部在研究之后，就举行一次宣传员会议，决定下次“爱国日”活动的主要内容，并且把它写到黑板报上。这次黑板报是用红粉笔写的。群众一看到黑板报换了红字，就知道要过“爱国日”了。大家都很注意，并且动手准备。
    “爱国日”集会在晚上举行。选择一家有宽大房子的院子作会场。会场里挂着国旗和毛主席像，点着汽灯，写上“爱国日”三个大字和一些标语口号，装饰得像过节一样。开会前由村里的“文娱队”打着锣鼓，并表演一些快板和小剧（不化装的）。人们笑着、跳着、鼓着掌，人来全了，就由村里的主要负责干部主持开会，简单地讲一讲时事和村里的工作情况，指出这次检查爱国公约时要注意的地方，并要大家讨论下半月的主要工作。接着大家就以居民组为单位分开讨论检查。个人和小组检查过后，又集中检查全村的爱国公约。大、小会上都注意表扬和批评。例如在十月下旬举行的“爱国日”集会里，村里刘四义因为认真执行了自己的爱国公约，受到了表扬。另一次“爱国日”集会里，村里郭金成因为秋征时交坏粮，受了大家的严格批评。
    这样的会议，因为大家事先有准备，而且成了习惯，所以开起会来很迅速，只要两三个钟头就可以结束。
    通过“爱国日”的活动，维社村把爱国公约的运动和村里的各项主要工作都紧紧地联系起来了。村里的干部和群众都说：“订好爱国公约，过好‘爱国日’，真比经常有一个县区干部的领导还有劲。”村里二百来户，每次“爱国日”集会至少有两百人参加。村里葛兴来说：“过去我烧香拜佛，天天担煤卖烧土，怎也糊不住嘴。现在有了十来亩地、一头毛驴，每天搞副业赚一斗米，日子越过越快活。这个‘爱国日’真是快活日。”村里一个农民刘芝不识字，看不懂黑板报，他说：“我就凭这‘爱国日’办事，不过就闷的不行。国里国外怎样哪？该怎样爱国呀？该做啥呀？村里谁好谁坏呀？到这天都明白了，真痛快！”许多人都认为过“爱国日”少开了会，少误了工，多办了事。
    现在，中共山西省委已在一九五二年宣传网工作计划里，提出推广维社村的“爱国日”制度。预定在“五一”节以前，争取全省城乡支部的三分之一都举办“爱国日”；十月一日以前推广到全省。（附图片）
