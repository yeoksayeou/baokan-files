    Teachers at Anhui University Should Undergo Ideological Remolding
    Comrade Editor: For the past two years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, teachers at Anhui University, like the students, have indeed made some progress in ideological remolding. This progress has encouraged and educated us. However, on the other hand, due to the persistence of Anglo-American bourgeois ideology and serious individualism among the teachers, there are shortcomings in teaching content and methods, resulting in a disconnect from reality and an inability to quickly improve teaching work. For example, this semester, in the Forest Product Manufacturing course of our Forestry Department's Forestry Specialty program, the teacher spent an entire month lecturing on the charcoal kiln chapter. He first introduced various types of charcoal kilns from capitalist countries in Europe and America, and then used Japanese charcoal kilns to represent Chinese charcoal kilns. In addition, we have raised concerns about the teaching methods of Professor Qi Jianru, Professor Ke Bingfan, and Professor Cheng Junqing, all of whom have not yet developed the practice of criticism and self-criticism, resulting in some misunderstandings. Our department has also established a Afforestation Teaching and Research Group and a Forest Products Utilization Teaching Group, and established a class representative system, but all of these have become mere formalities. Not only have teachers not made any improvements in teaching, but some teachers are completely unprepared before lectures. For example, Professor Chen Xuechen, who teaches us Forest Mensuration, has to shout "This is wrong, I need to review myself" in every class.

    In order to improve our teaching work, we hope that all teachers at Anhui University will use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to wage a resolute struggle against all old ideas and old influences.
            Zhao Xingliang, Third-Year Student, Forestry Department, Anhui University

    安徽大学教师应该进行思想改造学习
    编辑同志：两年来，我们安徽大学的教师和同学一样，在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，在思想改造方面的确有了一些进步。这些进步鼓舞了我们，教育了我们。可是另一方面，在教师中，由于还有着英美资产阶级的思想、严重的个人主义，因此，在教学内容上和教学方法上也就有脱离实际，不能很快改进教学工作的缺点。比如，本学期我们森林系林专科的林产制造一科，教师把炭窑一章就讲了整整一个月。他先把欧美资本主义国家各式各样的炭窑介绍了一番，然后把日本的炭窑代替了我国的炭窑讲了。此外，我们对教务长齐坚如教授，柯病凡教授和成俊卿教授的教学方法，都曾提出过意见，因为他们还没有养成批评与自我批评的作风，所以都多少发生过误会。我们系里也成立造林学教研组和林产利用学教学小组，并建立课代表制度，但所有这些都流于形式。不但教师在教学上没有什么改进，而有个别教师在讲课前就毫无准备，比如教我们测树学的陈雪尘教授每一堂课都要喊“这讲错了，我要检讨。”
    为了改进我们的教学工作，希望安徽大学全体教师用批评与自我批评的武器向一切的旧思想，旧影响作坚决的斗争。
