    Welcome the Heroic Sons and Daughters of the Motherland and the Heroic Friends of Korea
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China arrived in the capital yesterday. The people of the whole country express their sincere respect and warm welcome to the Volunteer Army Returning Representatives from the Korean front and the Korean friends who fought alongside us in the struggle against the common enemy.
    Dear comrades of the Volunteer Army Returning Delegation: The heroic spirit you demonstrated in the battle against the most savage American imperialism proves that you truly deserve to be the most outstanding sons and daughters of our people. The people of the motherland deeply know that their peaceful and happy life has been exchanged for the unimaginable hardships and self-sacrifice you have endured in the Korean War. You extinguished the flames of the American aggressors, who were about to burn into our great motherland, outside the national gate; you severely attacked the American robbers who broke into our border; the people of the whole country place their hopes on you and thank you.
    Dear comrades of the Korean People's Delegation to China: The great contribution of the Korean people's resolute struggle against American imperialism to the cause of defending world peace has received universal sympathy and respect from the people of our country. You have come to China, and you will see with your own eyes the profound brotherly friendship of the people of our country towards the Korean people. Dear comrades: It is the great strength displayed by you, the Korean people, and our Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield that has inspired the confidence and determination of the people all over the world to defend world peace. The people of our country are watching you with respect and supporting you with all their strength.
    When the Volunteer Army Returning Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China arrived in the capital, it was the time when the whole country was enthusiastically carrying out the great struggle of increasing production and practicing economy and opposing corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The representative comrades of the Volunteer Army will soon go to all parts of the country to comfort the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army and carry out propaganda work among the masses. This is a new force for launching the movement to increase production and practice economy. This force will play a great role in promoting our country's great struggle to increase production and practice economy and oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. This is the second time that the Volunteer Army has sent representatives back to the motherland. The previous experience proves that they brought back to the motherland the minds of the entire Volunteer Army and brought back to the front the minds of the people of the whole country, which played an important role in strengthening the connection between the front and the rear. The ten comrades of the Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, such as Chai Chuanruo, traveled 102,000 li in half a year and met more than 10 million people of the motherland, enabling 44.75 million people to hear their reports or radio speeches. After Comrade Chai Chuanruo and others returned to Korea, the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army heard about the active support of the people of the motherland to the front line and the construction of the motherland, and their confidence in victory was further strengthened. This is a vivid and lively political work to improve the combat will of the Volunteer Army. Representative comrades of the Volunteer Army, we hope that you will bring the spirit of the frontline commanders and fighters' heroic killing of the enemy and their spirit of protecting the motherland's materials with their own lives to the people of the whole country. Our Volunteer Army is not only a heroic unit, but also a model of cherishing and saving the motherland's materials. Now the Volunteer Army comrades are not only defending our motherland's wealth from being violated with their own blood, but also saving their not-so-rich clothes and food for the motherland, and rescuing weapons and ammunition in major fires, floods, and all serious conditions. This will be a profound education for the people of the whole country, which will encourage the people of the whole country to more resolutely carry out the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. There is no doubt that through the activities of the Volunteer Army representatives, the people of the whole country will understand the relationship between increasing production and practicing economy and resisting America and aiding Korea; understand that increasing production and practicing economy is their sacred responsibility to the motherland, so as to more closely combine patriotic enthusiasm with increasing production and practicing economy, so that we can launch the movement to increase production and practice economy and gain greater momentum.
    The Korean people have once again sent a delegation to visit China, which is of great significance for continuing to consolidate the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. Our people sent a delegation headed by Guo Moruo to visit Korea shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War in August 1950. In April 1951, the China People's Anti-American and Aid Korea General Association sent a delegation headed by Liao Chengzhi, Chen Yi, and Tian Han to the Korean front to comfort the Chinese and Korean soldiers and the Korean people. The Korean people also organized a Korean People's Delegation to China headed by Yuan Donggen, Jin Renchun, and Liu Jichun in June 1951 to come to our country. Last year, on National Day, a Korean People's Delegation headed by Xuan Xun participated in our National Day celebrations. This time, a delegation to China headed by Hong Chunzhe and Jin Chaojiu has come to our country. This fully shows that the destinies of the Chinese and Korean people have been linked together, and the mutual visits of the Chinese and Korean people have further promoted the fighting unity between the Chinese and Korean people.
    Let the people of our whole country continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, let us continue to consolidate the great internationalist friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, which is condensed with blood, and continue to strive for greater victories in the Korean anti-aggression war!

### 欢迎祖国的英雄子弟和朝鲜的英雄友人

    欢迎祖国的英雄子弟和朝鲜的英雄友人
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团已于昨日到达了首都。全国人民以崇敬的心情，对来自朝鲜前线的志愿军归国代表和在反对共同敌人的斗争中与我们并肩作战的朝鲜友人表示热烈的欢迎。
    亲爱的志愿军归国代表团的同志们：你们在和最野蛮的美帝国主义作战中所表现的英雄气概，证明你们真不愧为我国人民最优秀的儿女。祖国人民深切地知道自己的和平幸福的生活，是你们在朝鲜战争中所经受的难以想像的艰难困苦和自我牺牲所换来的。你们在国门之外扑灭了将要燃烧到我们伟大祖国来的美国侵略者的战火，你们痛击了闯到我国边境的美国强盗们，全国人民都把希望寄托给你们并感谢你们。
    亲爱的朝鲜人民访华代表团的同志们：伟大的朝鲜人民坚决反对美帝国主义的斗争对于保卫世界和平事业所作的崇高的贡献，受到我国人民普遍的同情和尊敬。你们来到中国，你们将亲眼看到我国人民心中对朝鲜人民的兄弟般的深厚友谊。亲爱的同志们：是你们朝鲜人民和我国志愿军在朝鲜战场所表现的伟大力量，鼓舞了全世界人民保卫世界和平的信心和决心。我国人民怀着敬爱的心情注视着你们，并且全力地支持着你们。
    当志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团的同志们到达首都的时候，正值全国热烈地开展增产节约和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争。志愿军的代表同志们不久将往全国各地慰问志愿军伤病员并向人民群众进行宣传工作。这是开展增产节约运动的一支新的力量。这支力量对于推进我国增产节约和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争将会发生很大的作用。志愿军已经是第二次派遣代表回到祖国。上一次的经验证明，他们把志愿军全军的心意带回祖国，又把全国人民的心意带回前线，这对于加强前线和后方的联系有重要的作用。上一次归国的志愿军代表柴川若等十位同志，他们在半年中，行程十万二千余里，见到了一千多万的祖国人民，使四千四百七十五万人民听到了他们的报告或广播演讲。柴川若等同志回到朝鲜以后，志愿军的指战员们听到了祖国人民积极支援前线和祖国建设的情形，胜利信心益加坚定，这是提高志愿军作战意志的一种生动活泼的政治工作。志愿军的代表同志们，希望你们将前线指战员们英勇杀敌的精神，将他们用自己的生命保护祖国物资的精神带到全国人民中去。我们的志愿军不但是一支英雄的部队，而且是爱护和节约祖国物资的模范。现在志愿军同志们不但用自己的鲜血保卫着我们祖国的财富不受侵犯，而且还正在为祖国节约自己并不富裕的衣服和粮食，在大火大水中和一切严重的条件下抢救武器和弹药。这对于全国人民将是一种深刻的教育，这将会鼓舞全国人民更坚决地进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争。毫无疑问，经过志愿军代表们的活动，全国人民更会懂得增产节约和抗美援朝之间的关系；懂得增产节约是自己对于祖国的神圣责任，从而把爱国主义的热情和增产节约更加密切地结合起来，使我们开展增产节约运动获得更大的动力。
    朝鲜人民再一次派遣访华代表团来到我国，对于继续巩固中朝人民战斗的友谊是很有意义的。我国人民曾于朝鲜战争发生不久之后，在一九五○年八月派遣以郭沫若为首的代表团访问朝鲜。一九五一年四月中国人民抗美援朝总会又派遣以廖承志、陈沂、田汉为首的慰问团赴朝鲜前线慰劳中朝战士和朝鲜人民。朝鲜人民也于一九五一年六月组织了以元东根、金仁春、柳基春为首的朝鲜人民访华代表团来到我国，去年国庆节又有以玄勋为首的朝鲜人民观礼代表团参加了我国国庆节，这次又有以洪淳哲、金朝奎为首的访华代表团来到我国。这充分显示了中朝两国人民的命运已经联结在一起，中朝人民的相互访问更加促进了中朝人民之间的战斗的团结。
    让我们全国人民继续加强抗美援朝的工作，让我们继续巩固中朝人民之间用鲜血凝结在一起的伟大的国际主义的友谊，继续努力争取朝鲜反侵略战争的更大胜利！
