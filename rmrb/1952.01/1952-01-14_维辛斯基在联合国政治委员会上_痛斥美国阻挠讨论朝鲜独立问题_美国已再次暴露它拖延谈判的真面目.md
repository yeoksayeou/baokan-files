Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 13th: According to TASS, after the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee concluded its discussion on the report of the so-called "Collective Measures Committee" on the 9th, it was supposed to proceed to the next item on the agenda – the Korean independence issue. However, at the meeting on the 9th, the U.S. representative suggested "postponing" the discussion of this issue, which was originally proposed by the U.S. delegation itself and included in the agenda by the General Assembly. The only argument the U.S. representative put forward to support his suggestion was that the armistice negotiations are currently underway in Korea, and the Political Committee's discussion of the Korean independence issue would affect these negotiations.

During the discussion of this U.S. proposal for an indefinite "postponement," the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, spoke twice, expressing the Soviet delegation's firm opposition to the U.S.'s blatant handling of the agenda and obstruction of the discussion of this issue of grave importance. Vyshinsky refuted the argument put forward by the U.S. representative, saying that there is no reason to link the armistice issue with the issue of a country's independence – a purely political issue. Korean independence has been jeopardized due to the presence of U.S. interventionist troops on Korean territory and due to the U.S. and its allies occupying Korean territory. Precisely for this reason, it is even more important now to discuss the issue of Korean independence in the Political Committee. This issue is irrelevant to the progress of the armistice negotiations.

Vyshinsky rebuked the U.S.'s self-contradictory and unreasonable attitude, saying: When you violated the UN Charter and forcibly transferred the functions of the Security Council to the General Assembly, you said that the Security Council was unable to bear the task of safeguarding peace, and therefore it was necessary to create a condition enabling the General Assembly to act when peace is threatened. But now, when we say that the General Assembly needs to discuss the issue of safeguarding peace, that it needs to discuss the Korean issue if not militarily, then at least politically, you say: "No, while the Korean War continues, we will not discuss this issue."

Vyshinsky pointed out that the U.S.'s suggestion to "postpone" the discussion of the Korean issue without mentioning a date for the postponement shows that the U.S. is attempting to eliminate this issue altogether. Vyshinsky exposed the real reason for the U.S.'s refusal to discuss Korean independence, saying that the U.S. put forward its suggestion not because it feared that the Korean armistice negotiations would be hindered, but because it wanted to delay the negotiations and prevent a peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue. The U.S. delegation is afraid that discussing Korean independence will once again expose the true face of the United States.

The representatives of Poland and Czechoslovakia firmly supported the Soviet Union's opinion. Even the Chilean representative, who has always absolutely obeyed the orders of his U.S. master, said this time that the U.S. representative's suggestion puzzled him. The Chilean representative asked: Why would discussing a political issue like Korean independence here hinder the military and technical negotiations currently underway in Korea?

The U.S. representative and their chorus of echoes were unable to answer the Soviet Union's accusations and still relied on a mechanical majority to pass the U.S. proposal, deciding to skip this item on the agenda.

    维辛斯基在联合国政治委员会上
    痛斥美国阻挠讨论朝鲜独立问题
    美国已再次暴露它拖延谈判的真面目
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会政治委员会在九日结束关于所谓“集体措施委员会”报告的讨论后，本来应该接着讨论下一项议程——朝鲜独立问题。但是美国代表却在九日会议上建议“延期”讨论这个原是美国代表团自己提出而经大会列入议程的问题。美国代表为支持他的建议而提出的唯一论据是：停战谈判目前正在朝鲜进行，政治委员会讨论朝鲜独立问题将影响这个谈判。
    在讨论美国这个无限期“延期”的建议的过程中，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基两次发言，表示苏联代表团坚决反对美国如此蛮横地处理议程和阻挠讨论这个具有严重的重要性的问题的行为。维辛斯基驳斥美国代表所提出的论据说：把停战问题和一个国家的独立问题——这样纯粹政治性的问题联系起来，是没有理由的。由于美国干涉军出现在朝鲜领土上，由于美国和它的盟国占领了朝鲜的领土，朝鲜的独立受到了危害。正因为这样，现在在政治委员会上讨论朝鲜独立问题就更加重要了。这个问题和停战谈判的进展问题是不相干的。
    维辛斯基斥责美国自相矛盾、蛮不讲理的态度说：你们在违背联合国宪章、硬把安全理事会的职权移交给大会时说：安全理事会无力负担保障和平的任务，因而必须创造一种条件，使大会在和平受到威胁时也能够行动起来。而现在，当我们说需要大会讨论保障和平的问题，需要如果不就军事方面至少也就政治方面来讨论朝鲜问题的时候，你们却说：“不，在朝鲜战争继续进行的时候，我们将不讨论这个问题。”
    维辛斯基指出：美国建议“延期”讨论朝鲜问题而不提延期到什么时日，这说明了美国企图根本去掉这个问题。维辛斯基揭露美国拒绝讨论朝鲜独立问题的真正原因说：美国所以提出它的建议，不是因为它怕朝鲜停战谈判将受到阻碍，而是因为它想拖延这个谈判，阻止和平解决整个朝鲜问题。美国代表团害怕讨论朝鲜独立问题再度暴露美国的真面目。
    波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表坚决拥护苏联的意见。甚至一向是绝对听从美国主子的命令的智利代表这一次也说：美国代表的建议使他迷惑不解。智利代表问道：为什么在这里讨论像朝鲜独立这样的政治问题会妨碍目前在朝鲜进行的军事与技术性质的谈判呢？
    美国代表和他们的一批应声虫无法对答苏联的责问，仍依靠机械的多数通过美国建议，决定跳过这一议程。
