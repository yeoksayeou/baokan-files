    Xinhua News Agency, London, January 9th: TASS reports from London on January 7th: Dutt, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, delivered a speech at a British Communist Party meeting in London on the Middle East issue. Dutt said: The purpose of this meeting is to help the British people understand the Middle East and to awaken them to take action to support the liberation struggles of the people of the Middle East. Dutt pointed out that Britain is the main military force in that region, therefore, the anti-imperialist sentiments of the masses of the people there are directly opposed to the British rulers and the British army. Representatives and guests from Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan, and the Union of South Africa, as well as members of the Middle East Committee of the British Communist Party, in their speeches during the discussion, described in detail the situation of the peoples of the Middle East and their struggles for independence.
    The meeting passed a resolution demanding "the complete withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, Sudan, Transjordan, Iraq, Cyprus, and all bases in the Middle East." The resolution also urged all participants in the British working-class movement to launch activities in the common struggle for peace and national independence.
