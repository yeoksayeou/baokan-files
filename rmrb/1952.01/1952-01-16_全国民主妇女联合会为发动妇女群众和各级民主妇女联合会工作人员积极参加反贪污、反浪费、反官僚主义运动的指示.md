To all levels of the Democratic Women's Federation and all Democratic Women's Member Organizations:

The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has been launched vigorously and swiftly throughout the country. Our democratic women's federations at all levels and democratic women's member organizations have also launched this struggle to varying degrees. However, so far, the development of this movement among the broad masses of women is still very uncommon and very superficial.

Currently, the participation of women in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement can be roughly divided into the following three types:

The first type is those who actively support and actively participate in this movement. Many women have bravely reported the corrupt elements and bribers they know, regardless of their relationship with these corrupt elements and bribers. They responded to Chairman Mao's call, regarding the fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy as a revolutionary struggle. They stepped forward and fearlessly reported the facts of some grassroots people's government staff, especially cadres and personnel of public security organs, who abused their power to embezzle, extort, and suppress democracy.

The second type is those who sincerely support the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, but have not actively joined the movement so far. They have many concerns, "afraid of offending people," "afraid of implicating themselves," "afraid of retaliation," and "afraid that the government will not be able to solve the problem thoroughly after reporting." For example, they dare not raise opinions about the police station, saying that "the current official is not as good as the current manager," and that exposing the problem will cause trouble in the long run. Some relatives of corrupt elements are afraid that if they report their relatives, the government will punish them according to law, resulting in unemployment and affecting their lives, so they adopt the attitude of saying less rather than more and avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial.

The third type is those who take a completely passive attitude towards this movement. They believe that they do not manage money, do not hold official positions, and do not engage in business, so they cannot talk about corruption, waste, or bureaucracy, nor can they talk about bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state financial secrets. This movement is irrelevant to them. Many women do not even know about this movement.

Of course, there are also some women who are not clean themselves, or have serious bureaucracy. Therefore, they cannot actively carry out this movement. Some of those with serious problems have confessed, while others are still concealing.

In order to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in the fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the organizations of the democratic women's federations at all levels should work actively under the unified leadership of the economy practice inspection committees at all levels and implement the principle of mobilizing both men and women. The democratic women's federations should focus on strengthening the work of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy among the masses of women who have not yet been organized. Various large and small meetings can be convened to mobilize them differently according to their different situations. Appropriate rewards, commendations, and protection should be given to those women who have bravely stood up to report corrupt elements. Those who are reported should not be allowed to threaten retaliation, otherwise, the punishment will be increased. For the general masses of women, the policies of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement and its important significance for national construction should be publicized to them, so that they can recognize that reporting corrupt elements is as glorious and patriotic as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The people's government and the democratic women's federation support this movement, and they should raise their sense of responsibility as masters of the country, so that they dare to break through affection and concerns for the interests of the country and the people and bravely supervise and report corrupt elements. Women who have participated in corruption or bribery should be told that only by thoroughly confessing and resolutely washing away stains can they reduce serious crimes, and those who are lightly punished can be exempted from punishment, so that they have a future, otherwise there is no future.

While mobilizing the broad masses of women, the democratic women's federations and democratic women's member organizations at all levels must set an example, with leaders taking the lead, to launch the fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy within their own organs, and carry out the struggle from the inside to the outside and from the top to the bottom. Any organs that have not yet launched the fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy should immediately convene mass meetings of their own organs, with layer upon layer taking the lead in making public self-criticisms; strive to mobilize the masses in a short period of time (such as ten days), otherwise the organ should be blamed. All those who have already launched or have deepened the movement among the masses of women should fully promote democracy, conduct denunciations and confessions, so that the movement can be further developed and deepened. It is necessary to improve the work of the women's federation through this movement, and more closely connect with the broad masses of women.

Now the All-China Democratic Women's Federation is launching the fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The responsible leaders have taken the lead in self-criticism, and the masses have been mobilized. We are now continuing to mobilize the masses, and conducting in-depth inspections layer by layer and mutual inspections. In order to more thoroughly inspect our leadership and effectively improve our work, we hope that you will offer more opinions on the leadership of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, so as to further improve the leadership. At the same time, we require the democratic women's federations and democratic women's member organizations at all levels to also inspect your leadership in the same way. In addition, all organizations and individuals who directly control production institutions should focus on inspecting the phenomena of corruption and waste in the production departments. All women's organizations should carry out inspections layer by layer and mutual inspections, so that everyone can be educated, inspected everywhere, improve work, improve leadership, and eliminate the corrosion and influence of bourgeois ideology on women workers through this movement. Only in this way can the All-China Democratic Women's Federation better assume the great task of leading the women of the whole country to participate in national construction.

We hope that the democratic women's federations of major administrative regions, the directly subordinate municipal democratic women's federations, and the democratic women's member organizations will submit a comprehensive report on the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to this federation by the end of January; the reports of the directly subordinate provincial and municipal democratic women's federations of the major administrative regions to the democratic women's federations of the major administrative regions should also be sent to this federation.

All-China Democratic Women's Federation, January 14th

### 全国民主妇女联合会为发动妇女群众和各级民主妇女联合会工作人员积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的指示

    全国民主妇女联合会为发动妇女群众和各级民主妇女联合会工作人员积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的指示各级民主妇女联合会及各民主妇女会员团体：
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，已经大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地在全国各地展开了。我们各级民主妇女联合会及各民主妇女会员团体也已经在不同程度上展开了这一斗争。但是到目前为止，这一运动在广大妇女群众中间发展的还是很不普遍，很不深入的。
    目前妇女群众参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的情况，大体可以分做以下三种类型：
    第一种人，是积极拥护和积极参加这个运动的。已经有不少的妇女，勇敢地检举了自己所知道的贪污分子和行贿分子，而不顾这些贪污分子、行贿分子和自己有什么关系。她们响应毛主席的号召，把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义，当成一场革命斗争，她们挺身而出、不怕报复检举了一些基层人民政府工作人员特别是公安机关的干部和公安人员利用职权贪赃枉法、敲诈勒索和压制民主的事实。
    第二种人，她们是衷心地拥护反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的，但直到现在为止尚未积极投入运动，她们有很多顾虑，“怕得罪人”、“怕连累自己”、“怕报复”，“怕检举出来，政府不能彻底解决问题”。比如她们对派出所就不敢提意见，说是“现官不如现管”，揭了盖子，日久会找麻烦。有些贪污分子的亲属，怕检举了自己的亲属，政府依法处办，因而招致失业，影响自己的生活，因而采取说小不说大、避重就轻的态度。
    第三种人，是对于这个运动，完全采取消极态度。她们认为自己不管钱、不做官、也不经商，因而说不到贪污、浪费、官僚主义，也说不到行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料及盗窃国家财经机密，这个运动是与自己无关系的。有很多妇女甚至还不知道有这个运动。
    当然，也还有一些妇女自己手上就不干净，或有严重的官僚主义。因而不能积极开展这一运动，其中问题严重的人，有的已在坦白，有的还在隐瞒。
    为了发动广大妇女群众参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，各级民主妇女联合会的组织，应当在各级节约检查委员会统一领导下，积极工作，贯彻男女一齐发动的方针。民主妇女联合会应当着重加强那些还没有组织的妇女群众中间的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的工作，可以召集各种大会小会，针对她们的不同情况作不同的动员。对于那些已经勇敢地起来检举了贪污分子的妇女，应当作适当的奖励表扬和保护，不准被检举人威胁报复，否则加重处罚。对于一般妇女群众，应该向她们宣传反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的方针政策和对建设国家的重要意义，使她们认识检举贪污分子和抗美援朝一样，是光荣的爱国的行动，人民政府和民主妇女联合会是支持这个运动的，提高她们国家主人翁的责任心，使她们为了国家和人民的利益，敢于起来破除情面和顾虑，勇敢地监督和检举贪污分子。对于参加贪污或行贿的妇女，要告诉她们只有彻底坦白，坚决清洗污点，才能重罪减轻，轻者免罪，才有前途，否则是没有前途的。
    在发动广大妇女群众的同时，各级民主妇女联合会及民主妇女会员团体，必须以身作则、首长带头，展开本机关内部的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，由内向外由上到下开展斗争。凡是机关内尚未展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争的，应立即召开本机关群众大会层层带头，公开检讨；务期于短期内（比如十日）把群众发动起来，否则该机关应该受到指责。凡是已经展开或已将运动深入到了妇女群众中间去的，就要充分发扬民主，进行检举、坦白，使运动更加发展和深入。必须做到通过这一运动改进妇联工作，更加密切和广大妇女群众的连系。
    现在全国民主妇女联合会，就正在展开着反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。负责领导人已带头检讨，群众已经发动起来。现正继续发动群众，深入按层检查，相互检查。我们为了更深入地检查我们的领导，切实改进工作，希望你们对全国民主妇女联合会的领导多多提出意见，以便更进一步地改进领导。同时要求各级民主妇女联合会及民主妇女会员团体也同样检查你们的领导。此外，凡是直接掌握生产机构的组织和个人，更应着重检查生产部门的贪污浪费现象。所有妇女团体都应当做到层层检查，相互检查，以便经过这一运动使人人受到教育，处处受到检查，改进工作，改进领导，肃清资产阶级思想对于妇女工作人员的腐蚀和影响。只有这样，全国民主妇女联合会，才能更好地担负起领导全国妇女群众参加国家建设的伟大任务。
    希望各大行政区民主妇女联合会，直属市民主妇女联合会及各民主妇女会员团体于一月底向本会作一次关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的综合报告；各大行政区的直属省市民主妇女联合会向大行政区民主妇女联合会的报告，同时寄一份给本会。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会  一月十四日
