    Communist Party Member Zhang Ziliang Consistently Maintains a Hardworking and Simple Style
    By Wang Jiao and Shao Guohuan
    (1) Zhang Ziliang, Deputy Director of the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau and a Communist Party member, joined the revolution in 1936. He later worked in the General Office of the CCP Central Committee in Yan'an, where he was once selected as a special-class labor model.
    (2) Three years ago, he wore an old military overcoat and carried a small luggage roll (containing only a gray blanket and a worn-out cotton quilt) to take up his position as Deputy Director of the Forest Industry Bureau.
    (3) During this time, he often lived with workers in the forest areas, specifically helping the workers solve production problems, thus becoming one of the most familiar and beloved comrades and leaders among the workers.

    （一）东北森林工业总局副局长、共产党员张子良，一九三六年参加革命，后来在延安中共中央办公厅工作，那时曾被评选为特等劳动模范。
    （二）三年前，他穿着一身旧军用大衣，带着一个小行李卷（里面只有一条灰毯子和一床破棉被），到森林工业总局就任副局长的职务。
    （三）他这时经常和林区工人们一起生活，很具体地帮助工友们解决生产上的问题，所以成为工人们最熟悉最爱戴的一个同志和领导者。
