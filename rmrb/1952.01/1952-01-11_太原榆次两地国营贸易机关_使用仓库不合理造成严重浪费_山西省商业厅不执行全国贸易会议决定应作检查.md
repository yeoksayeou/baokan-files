    State-Owned Trading Organizations in Taiyuan and Yuci
    Waste Severely Due to Unreasonable Use of Warehouses;
    Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce Fails to Implement Decisions of National Trade Conference and Should Conduct Self-Criticism

    In order to understand the warehouse usage situation in various localities, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government dispatched an inspection team in November of last year to inspect the warehouse conditions in Taiyuan and Yuci, Shanxi Province. They discovered serious waste in warehouse usage and basic warehouse construction planning. The Shanxi Provincial Grain Company leased the Xiaodongmen warehouse, and from August to November of last year, only four rooms were used as dormitories and guard rooms, while the other rooms remained idle. More than one-third of the newly built grain warehouses were also vacant. However, the Shanxi Provincial Department Store had too little warehouse space for its goods, and many materials were stored in the open air. The newly built warehouse of the Shanxi Provincial Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company was completed three months ago, but it remains empty. At the same time, the Shanxi Provincial Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company did not consider that the purchase of cotton would be managed by cooperatives in the future, and that the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company would no longer need loose cotton warehouses, but it spent 3 billion yuan to build loose cotton warehouses in various places, occupying a huge amount of basic construction funds. The newly built warehouse of the Shanxi Provincial Industrial Equipment Company was only used for a little more than one-third of its capacity. The newly built warehouse of the Yuci Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company was mostly vacant, but it stored cotton gins in the open air. An'yi County built a salt warehouse at a cost of 500 million yuan, originally planned to store untaxed salt, but because it did not comply with the salt tax system, the Salt Bureau did not allow goods to be stored, and most of it has been vacant and unused. The cement warehouse of the Shanxi Provincial Coal Construction Company only had inventory occupying one-half of the warehouse capacity; however, the company stored more than 100 bags of cement in the open air, allowing them to be exposed to rain and moisture.

    In addition, the materials stored in the warehouses were often piled up in large heaps or against the walls, making it difficult to check and easily causing mildew damage; and the excessive lateral pressure affected the life of the warehouses. At the same time, the companies did not pay enough attention to warehouse fire-fighting equipment.

    Regarding the adjustment and rational use of warehouses, the National Trade Conference in September of last year decided that each city and provincial department and bureau of commerce should be responsible for inspection and appropriate adjustment; however, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce did not implement this decision, resulting in unreasonable warehouse usage: on the one hand, basic construction costs were wasted, and existing warehouse facilities could not be fully utilized; on the other hand, many materials could not be stored in warehouses, increasing material losses. This is an intolerable waste, and the Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce should conduct a public self-criticism. (Cao Naikang)

    太原榆次两地国营贸易机关
    使用仓库不合理造成严重浪费
    山西省商业厅不执行全国贸易会议决定应作检查
    中央人民政府贸易部，为了解各地仓库使用情况，去年十一月间派出检查组，检查了山西省太原、榆次两地仓库的状况，发现在仓库使用和仓库基本建设计划方面，有严重的浪费现象。山西省粮食公司租赁小东门仓库，自去年八月到十一月，除利用四间作宿舍及警卫室外，其他房间一直闲着；新建的粮食仓库，也空闲着三分之一以上。而山西省百货公司却货多库少，很多物资放在露天。山西省花纱布公司新建的仓库已完工三个月，但仍然空着。同时，山西省花纱布公司没有考虑到今后收购棉花改由合作社经营，花纱布公司已不需用散花库，却又以三十亿元修建了各地的散花库，占压了巨大数量的基本建设资金。山西省工业器材公司新建的仓库，只利用了三分之一多一点。榆次花纱布公司新建仓库大部空闲，但却把库存轧花机露天存放。安邑县建好盐仓一座，投资五亿元，原计划存放未税盐，因不合盐税制度，盐务局不准进货，至今大部空闲没用。山西省煤建公司的洋灰库，库存物资仅占仓库容量的二分之一；但这个公司却把一百多袋洋灰露天存放，任它们遭受雨淋水湿。
    另外，仓库里存的物资多垒成大堆或靠墙堆积，这样既不易查点，又易霉损；而且侧压力过大，影响仓库的寿命。同时，各公司对仓库消防设备也不够重视。
    关于调整和合理使用仓库问题，去年九月全国贸易会议曾决定由各城市及省商业厅、局负责检查，进行适当调剂；但山西省商业厅并没有执行这个决定，以致仓库使用上发生不合理现象：一方面浪费基本建设费用，现有的仓库设备不能充分利用；另一方面，却有不少物资，不能存放到仓库里，增加了物资的损耗。这是一种不能容忍的浪费现象，山西省商业厅应作公开检讨。　（曹乃康）
