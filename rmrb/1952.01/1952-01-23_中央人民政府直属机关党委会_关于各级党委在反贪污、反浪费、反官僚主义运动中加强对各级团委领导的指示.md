    The Youth League members of the organs directly under the Central People's Government, including its commissions, ministries, associations, academies, administrations, and banks, have mostly actively participated in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Facts have proven that in units where the Party attaches importance to and correctly leads, the Communist Youth League has exerted a more significant force. Now, in order to deeply and universally carry out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, Party committees at all levels should more boldly mobilize Youth League members and all young people in the organs. However, some Party leading comrades have not recognized the role that the Communist Youth League can play in this movement, and therefore have not used the organizational strength of the Communist Youth League; or the Youth League members have already been mobilized, but the Party has not firmly grasped the leadership of the League, thus the activities of the League organization cannot be consistent with the Party's leadership steps, which will cause undue losses to the movement. For this reason, the following instructions are given: (1) The economy inspection committees at all levels should not only absorb League cadres to participate in the work, but more importantly, lead and mobilize all Youth League members to actively participate in this movement, and establish organizational activities of the Youth League system under the close leadership of the Party; (2) Timely inform the Youth League organizations of the Party's current policies and arrangements for the movement, and put forward specific requirements for the League; (3) Help the Communist Youth League committees at all levels strengthen ideological education for Youth League members, pay attention to preventing egalitarianism and ultra-democracy tendencies that League members may produce or have already produced, and guide the enthusiasm of Youth League members to the correct path.

    中央人民政府直属机关党委会
    关于各级党委在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中加强对各级团委领导的指示
    中央人民政府各委、部、会、院、署、行的机关青年团员，大多数已积极地参加了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。事实证明凡是在党重视与正确领导下的各单位，青年团就发挥了更为显著的力量。现在为了深入普遍地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，各级党委更应放手地发动青年团员与机关全体青年。但有个别的党的领导同志，没有认识到青年团在这一运动中可能发挥的作用，因而还没有使用青年团的组织力量；或者是青年团员已经发动起来，党没有抓紧对团的领导，因而使团组织的活动不能与党的领导步骤一致，这样都会使运动遭受不应有的损失。为此特作如下指示：（一）各级节约检查委员会不仅要吸收团的干部参加工作，更重要的是领导与发动全体青年团员积极参加这一运动，并在党的密切领导下，建立青年团系统的组织活动；（二）及时把党对当前运动的方针与部署告诉青年团的组织，并提出对团的具体要求；（三）帮助各级团委加强对青年团员的思想教育，要注意防止团员可能产生与已经产生的平均主义及极端民主化的偏向，并将青年团员的积极性与热情，引到正确道路。
