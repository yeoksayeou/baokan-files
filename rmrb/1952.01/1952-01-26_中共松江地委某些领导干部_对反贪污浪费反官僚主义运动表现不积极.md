    Certain Leading Cadres of the CCP Songjiang Prefectural Committee
    Showed Lack of Enthusiasm in the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement

    Comrade Editor: Certain leading cadres of the CCP Songjiang Prefectural Committee have the erroneous idea of "getting by" in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. Instead of mobilizing the masses and setting an example by conducting self-criticism, they shut themselves behind closed doors and held a meeting of cadres above the section chief level, conducting a perfunctory and superficial self-examination, and then considering the matter closed. They are unwilling to meet with the masses, which has led to many complaints from lower-level cadres. In fact, there are many things they should deeply examine. For example, the responsible comrade of the Prefectural Committee spent over 100 million yuan to build a dormitory. Yu Kechang, the Second Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, used a car to pick up his wife to go to Shanghai to see a movie. He believes that these wasteful phenomena "cannot be seen as waste," so he glossed over them lightly during his self-criticism. Yang Chun, the Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, also gave a superficial self-criticism, without touching upon his own ideology at all. Now, the whole country is vigorously carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. The Central Committee has repeatedly instructed all localities that in this movement, leading cadres must take responsibility, personally take action, and fully mobilize the masses. However, the leading comrades of the Songjiang Prefectural Committee have shown such a lack of enthusiasm. This shows that they do not sufficiently understand the significance of the movement. They still lack the courage to transform themselves. These phenomena should be quickly corrected.

    中共松江地委某些领导干部
    对反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动表现不积极
    编辑同志：中共松江地委的某些领导干部，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中有错误的过关思想。他们不是发动群众，以身作则地进行自我检讨，而是关起门来召开一个科长以上的干部会议，极不深刻地检讨一番，就算了事。他们不愿意和群众见面，以致下面干部意见很多。其实他们应该深刻检讨的事情是不少的。例如，地委负责同志盖宿舍就用了一亿多。地委第二副书记余克常用小汽车去接老婆到上海看电影。对这些浪费现象，他认为“不能看做浪费”，因此，在检讨时都轻轻掠过了。地委副书记杨纯检讨得也极不深刻，丝毫没有接触到自己的思想。现在全国正在轰轰烈烈地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。中央一再指示各地，在这一运动中必须首长负责，亲自动手，充分发动群众，而松江地委的领导同志却表现得这样不积极。这说明他们对运动的意义是认识不足的。他们还没有勇气来改造自己。这些现象应该迅速纠正。
