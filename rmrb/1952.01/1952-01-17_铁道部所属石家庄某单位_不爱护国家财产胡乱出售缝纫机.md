    A Certain Unit of the Shijiazhuang Branch of the Ministry of Railways
    Carelessly Sells Sewing Machines, Showing No Regard for State Property
    Comrade Editor:
    At the end of December 1951, a certain unit of the Shijiazhuang Branch of the Ministry of Railways sold some sewing machines that had been cleared out of the warehouse. The personnel in charge of this matter did not care about whether the sewing machines were new or old, good or bad, and uniformly priced them at 2 million yuan apiece. Among them was a Singer brand machine, which could have been sold for more than 20 million yuan according to market prices, but they only sold it for 2 million yuan. This is a serious display of irresponsibility towards state property and should be investigated.

    铁道部所属石家庄某单位
    不爱护国家财产胡乱出售缝纫机
    编辑同志：一九五一年十二月底，铁道部所属石家庄某单位把从仓库里清理出来的一些缝纫机卖掉了。负责这件事的人员也不管缝纫机的新旧好坏，统通定价二百万元一部。其中有一部是胜家牌的，按市价可卖二千多万元，但他们也只卖了二百万元。这是对国家财产严重不负责任的表现，应该检查。  滑述焕
