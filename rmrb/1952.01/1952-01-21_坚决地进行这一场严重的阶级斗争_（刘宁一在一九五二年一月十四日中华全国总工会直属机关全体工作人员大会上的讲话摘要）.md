    Resolutely Carry Out This Serious Class Struggle
    (Summary of a Speech by Liu Ningyi at a Meeting of All Staff Members of Organizations Directly Under the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on January 14, 1952)
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened another meeting of all staff members of organizations directly under it (including the national committees of various industrial unions) on the 14th. Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, gave a speech at the meeting entitled "Resolutely Carry Out This Serious Class Struggle."
    Liu Ningyi first summarized the situation of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement carried out by the organizations directly under the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in the past two weeks. He said: Since Chairman Mao called on us on January 1st to actively participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the various departments and organizations directly under the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, due to the responsibility of the leaders at all levels and the implementation of self-criticism, the masses have been fully mobilized and have entered a climax. In the movement, everyone realized that this is a serious class struggle, and many people who usually do not like to speak up also came forward with opinions; from top to bottom, leading cadres at all levels have seriously conducted and are conducting strict criticism and self-criticism. The movement has exposed 64 cases of corruption of varying degrees, and uncovered various extravagant and wasteful behaviors in the organization, as well as serious bureaucracy on the part of the leadership. Through this movement, the class consciousness of all staff members has been greatly enhanced.
    He said: This spirit of daring to expose one's own shortcomings and boldly conduct criticism and self-criticism is the true character of our working class.
    After Liu Ningyi analyzed in detail the corruption, waste, and bureaucratic work styles exposed in the movement, he profoundly pointed out the class nature of the movement. He said: In the three years since entering the city, the bourgeoisie's attack on the working class and trade union organizations has been very rampant and malicious. He said: The bourgeoisie attacks us in various ways, and is extremely cunning, fierce, despicable, and filthy. He listed some cases that have been exposed in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions organizations to illustrate this issue: The bourgeoisie not only erodes our staff members with its ideology and work style, but some bourgeois elements have even infiltrated our organizations. For example, the deputy director of our guesthouse was a former businessman. He would embezzle and waste at every opportunity, and even lured an old cadre who had participated in the Long March into eating, drinking, and indulging in pleasure. This old cadre originally lived a very simple life, but was eventually corrupted by him. Liu Ningyi also pointed out the universality of this bourgeois offensive. For example, in private enterprises, capitalists threatened to fire workers who joined the trade union; or sent lackeys to infiltrate the trade union; and used bribery and gifts to buy off cadres; and sow discord. They told the workers: I will give you whatever you want, but I don't agree with you joining the Communist Party and the trade union. The purpose of their doing this is to sow discord between the workers and the trade union, and between the workers and the Communist Party, but some trade union cadres did not realize this. These comrades were injured and captured by the bourgeoisie's offensive.
    Liu Ningyi continued to point out: Many shameless businessmen did not hesitate to use various despicable means to give gifts and bribes to our cadres. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has now found out that real estate agents once used nearly 10 million yuan in kickbacks to buy off five of our personnel responsible for purchasing houses. As for some private merchants directly stealing our property, there are countless examples. A private construction company built four bungalows for us, but it was not only short of six columns attached to the wall, but also embezzled ten bags of cement and bought ten cubic meters of timber through illegal channels. A merchant who engaged in speculative transactions made 1.4 billion yuan in business with us by bribery and deception alone. One of the deals even involved receiving funds in advance for gasoline speculation, and the amount of money defrauded from the state has not yet been calculated. In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, these unscrupulous merchants openly inquired about the situation everywhere, prevented our cadres from confessing, and even dared to come to collude with each other to destroy our movement.
    In the second part of his speech, Liu Ningyi talked about the trade union's important responsibility and its favorable conditions in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. He said: Our working class is the producer, and our class essence is diligence, simplicity, loyalty, purity, and selflessness. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class has carried out arduous and outstanding struggles for the liberation of the Chinese people. The Chinese working class has a glorious revolutionary tradition. Our trade union organization has always been under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, uniting and educating the entire working class to fight for the liberation of the Chinese people. Today, the Chinese trade union organization is even more the link between the Party and the working masses, and the main pillar of the People's Government. Our class and our Party are glorious and great. A few members of our ranks have been injured or captured by the bourgeoisie's offensive, and have been contaminated with many toxins. This is the damage caused by the bourgeoisie to us. Therefore, we must fight with a serious and painful mood, liberate those captured members, heal those who have been injured, and cleanse their bodies for them. We must establish a strong working-class ideology, rectify our ranks, and give a resolute blow to the bourgeoisie's offensive against us. We must impose legal sanctions on illegal merchants who evade taxes, offer bribes, disrupt the market, speculate, and steal state assets. We must strictly criticize and transform the bourgeoisie's various decadent and corrupting ideologies, and never allow them to spread to the working class. Then, we will lead the people of the whole country, work diligently and thriftily, increase production and practice economy, and strive to build an industrialized and prosperous new China; in the future, we will move towards socialist and communist society. He said: Only in this way can the victory of the revolution be guaranteed, and the firm and unwavering leadership of the working class can be established. He said: This is where the favorable conditions and important responsibilities of our trade union organization in carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement lie.
    In the third part of his speech, Liu Ningyi explained the policies of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. He said: Our policies are positive and progressive, and our goal is to increase production and practice economy, and to promote construction. Our movement has great political significance, because it is a matter of deciding who leads whom, and it is a matter of deciding whether working-class ideology or bourgeois ideology leads our work. It is by no means just a matter of saving a few dollars for the organization.
    He demanded that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the organizations directly under the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should develop more fully and deeply, which means recognizing the direction, taking a step forward in ideology, and fully developing democracy under leadership. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels must further examine themselves again from the ideological roots and class roots, conduct in-depth self-criticism, and everyone should take a clean bath. Those who have made mistakes of corruption, some have already confessed thoroughly, and they should be welcomed; some have not confessed thoroughly, and they should be required to give a complete account; some are still unwilling to confess, which is a mistake on top of a mistake, and is a surrender to the bourgeoisie with all their heart. Such people must be severely punished.
    Liu Ningyi concluded his speech with the following opinions. He said: Every comrade should recognize the goals of the movement, recognize that this is a serious class struggle, and a resolute counterattack by the working class against the bourgeoisie's offensive against us for the past three years. Therefore, we must start by opposing the erosion of bourgeois ideology on us, and then develop to expose and report all kinds of crimes of illegal merchants. We must develop the movement from inside the organization to society. To this end, we must first cleanse ourselves, remove the filth of bourgeois ideology from us, establish a strong working-class ideology, and then give full play to the role of the trade union, mobilize the working masses, and oppose illegal merchants. At the same time, the various industrial unions should combine with the relevant industrial departments to help the relevant enterprise departments to deeply carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, eliminate the toxins of bourgeois ideology, and carry out our production and construction work.
    After the meeting, all departments and national committees of various industrial unions organized all staff members to discuss Liu Ningyi's speech. Some units also actively arranged meetings for confession and reporting. Everyone is concentrating their efforts to prepare to push the movement to a higher stage of development.

    坚决地进行这一场严重的阶级斗争
    （刘宁一在一九五二年一月十四日中华全国总工会直属机关全体工作人员大会上的讲话摘要）
    中华全国总工会在十四日再次召开直属机关（包括各产业工会全国委员会）全体工作人员大会。全国总工会副主席刘宁一以“坚决地进行这一场严重的阶级斗争”为题在会上讲话。
    刘宁一首先总结了全国总工会直属机关在过去两周中开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的情况。他说：自从一月一日毛主席号召我们积极地参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动以后，全国总工会各部门、各直属机关，由于首长层层负责、进行了检讨，群众已经充分发动起来了，而且已进入了高潮。在运动中，每一个人都认识到这是一场严重的阶级斗争，许多平常不爱讲话的人也纷纷提出意见；从上到下，各级领导干部都认真地进行了和正在进行着严格的批评和自我批评，运动中已暴露了大小贪污案件六十四起，揭发了机关中各种铺张浪费行为及领导方面的严重官僚主义。通过这一运动，全体工作人员的阶级觉悟已大大提高了一步。
    他说：这种勇于揭露自己的缺点大胆进行批评和自我批评的精神，正是我们工人阶级的本色。
    刘宁一详细分析了运动中所暴露出来的贪污、浪费行为和官僚主义作风以后，深刻指出运动的阶级性质。他说：进城三年来，资产阶级向工人阶级和工会组织的进攻是十分猖獗和恶毒的。他说：资产阶级向我们进攻的方式花样百出，而且极端狡猾、凶狠、卑鄙与龌龊，他列举了全国总工会机关已经揭发出来的一些案件来说明这一问题：资产阶级不仅以他的思想作风侵蚀了我们的工作人员，有的资产阶级分子更打入了我们的机关。比如我们的一个招待所副所长就是一个旧商人，他一有机会就贪污、浪费，还引诱我们一个参加过长征的老干部吃喝享乐。这个老干部本来生活很朴素，后来终于被他引诱坏了。刘宁一并指出资产阶级这一进攻的普遍性。如在私营企业中，资方以开除相威胁，不准工人加入工会；或派遣走狗打入工会；请客、送礼，收买干部；挑拨离间。他们对工人说：你们要什么我给什么，就是你们参加共产党和工会我不同意。他们这样做，其目的就是挑拨工人群众和工会的关系，挑拨工人群众和共产党的关系，但有些工会干部没有认识这一点，这些同志在资产阶级的进攻下受了伤，做了俘虏。
    刘宁一继续指出：许多无耻的商人为了向我们的干部送礼塞钱，不惜采用各种卑鄙手段。全国总工会现已查出，房纤们曾经用近一千万元的回扣收买过我们五个负责购买房屋的人员。至于有些私商直接偷窃我们的财产的行为，就更举不胜举。一个私营建筑公司给我们盖了四间平房，不但缺少六根贴墙的柱子，还套去我们十包洋灰和套购了十立方公尺的木材。有一个买空卖空的商人，单凭行贿和欺骗，和我们做了十四亿元的生意，其中一批生意竟先领取资金作汽油投机，骗窃国家多少金钱尚未计算。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，这些奸商竟公然到处打听风声，阻止我们的干部坦白，甚至胆敢跑来串通口供，破坏我们的运动。
    在讲话的第二部分，刘宁一谈了工会在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中的重大责任和它的有利条件。他说：我们工人阶级是生产者，我们的阶级本质是勤劳朴素、忠诚纯洁和大公无私。中国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，为了中国人民的解放事业作了艰苦卓绝的斗争，中国工人阶级有光荣的革命传统。我们工会组织向来就在中国共产党的领导下，团结教育全体工人群众为中国人民的解放而奋斗。今天，中国的工会组织更是党联系工人群众的纽带，人民政府的主要支柱。我们的阶级和我们的党是光荣的伟大的。我们队伍中的少数分子在资产阶级的进攻下面受了伤，或被俘了，沾染了许多污毒。这是资产阶级给我们的伤害。因此，我们要以严肃沉痛的心情进行战斗，解放那些被俘掳的分子，医治好受了伤的人，替他们洗净身体。我们要树立起坚强的工人阶级的思想，整顿好我们的队伍，对资产阶级向我们的进攻给以坚决的打击。对偷税漏税、行贿捣乱、投机倒把、盗窃国家资产的不法商人，给以法律上的制裁。对资产阶级的种种堕落腐化思想，要进行严格的批评和改造，决不许它传播到工人阶级内部来。然后，领导全国人民，克勤克俭，增产节约，为建立一个工业化的、富强的新中国而奋斗；在将来，更要走向社会主义和共产主义社会。他说：只有这样革命胜利才有保证，才能树立起坚定不移的工人阶级的领导。他说：这就是我们工会组织进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的有利条件和重大的责任所在。
    讲话的第三部分，刘宁一解释了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的政策。他说：我们的政策是积极的、前进的，我们的目的是为了增产节约，生产建设。我们的运动是有重大政治意义的，因为这是决定谁领导谁的问题，这是决定工人阶级思想来领导我们的工作还是资产阶级思想来领导我们的工作的问题，绝不单是给机关省几个钱就算了。
    他要求全国总工会直属机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动要发展得更饱满、更深入，这就是要认清方向，在思想上提高一步，有领导地充分发扬民主。因此，各级领导干部必须进一步从思想根源、阶级根源上来再一次进行检讨，深入进行自我批评，每个人都洗个干净澡。犯过贪污错误的人，有些已经彻底坦白了，对他们应表示欢迎；有的人坦白还不彻底，要求他们彻底交代；有的人还不肯坦白，这是错上加错，是死心向资产阶级投降。对这种人，必须严加制裁。
    刘宁一以如下的意见结束了他的讲话。他说：每个同志要认清运动的目标，认清这是一场严重的阶级斗争，是工人阶级对资产阶级三年来向我们的进攻的坚决反击。因此，我们要从反对资产阶级思想对我们的侵蚀起，进而发展到揭发、检举一切不法商人的各种罪行。把运动从机关内部发展到社会上去。为此，我们要先洗净自己，去掉资产阶级给我们沾染上的污垢，树立起坚强的工人阶级的思想，然后充分发挥工会的作用，动员工人群众，反对不法商人。同时，各产业工会要和有关的工业部门结合，帮助有关的企业部门，深入展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，扫清资产阶级思想的污毒，开展我们的增产建设工作。
    会后，各部门和各产业工会全国委员会，都组织全体工作人员讨论了刘宁一的讲话。有些单位并积极布置坦白和检举的会议。大家都在集中力量，准备把运动推向更高的发展阶段。（新华社）
