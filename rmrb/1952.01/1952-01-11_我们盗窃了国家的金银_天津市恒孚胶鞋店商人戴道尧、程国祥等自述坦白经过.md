    We Stole the State's Gold and Silver
    -- Confessions of Dai Daoyao, Cheng Guoxiang, and Others, Merchants of Tianjin Hengfu Rubber Shoe Store

    "If you don't want people to know, the best thing to do is not do it." Having a "disease" in our hearts, having stolen the state's property, if we didn't speak out, those who knew about it would have. We few have done a lot of wrong things in the past. Since the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, everyone has been struggling with their thoughts for a long time. If we speak, we are afraid of being punished; if we don't speak, we are afraid of being exposed in the future, which would be even more embarrassing. We decided to speak out anyway. Because only by doing so can we be worthy of the country, worthy of the people, and worthy of our own conscience.

    We originally ran "Hengfu Gold Store," and in September 1949, we changed our business to "Hengfu Department Store"; in July 1950, we changed it to "Hengfu Rubber Shoe Store." It was in April 1949 that Li Fengxiang, deputy section chief of the exchange stock of the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China (he has been arrested by the government for corruption), introduced us to more than two thousand taels of gold to melt from the North China Foreign Trade Administration. When we saw the gold, we lost our conscience! At that time, we instigated the gold melting workers to secretly replace four taels of gold with silver. In July of that year, a cadre wearing a "Yuda Company" badge brought more than a thousand taels of gold to melt (the cadre said it was gold from the "Opium Prohibition Bureau"), and we again instigated the workers to secretly replace four taels. In April and May 1950, this cadre came again with four or five hundred taels of gold, and we secretly replaced one tael. In early March 1951, the Tianjin Municipal Finance Bureau came to melt one thousand seven or eight hundred taels of gold, and we secretly replaced three taels.

    Another time was in 1949 when private gold stores in Tianjin were changing their business, and the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China redeemed a large number of silver jewelry. Li Fengxiang asked private gold stores to refine it into pure silver. At that time, he also asked us. We again instigated the workers to steal more than fifty taels of gold-plated ornaments (most of which were silver), and stole about four taels of gold extracted from the gold-plated ornaments. In total, we stole sixteen taels of gold and more than fifty taels of silver from the state.

    In November 1951, Li Fengxiang was finally arrested by the government for corruption and dereliction of duty. This incident was also published in the Tianjin Daily, which also mentioned his relationship with private gold stores. When we saw this news, we were very scared. The People's Court also summoned us to court, but at that time we still deceived the government against our conscience. Apart from bribery and trivial matters, we did not admit anything. But from that time on, a disease was planted in our hearts. Whenever the newspaper published any corruption news, we would desperately read it over and over again, but the more we read, the more scared we became.

    After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement started, more and more people reported and confessed, and we became more and more uneasy. What to do? We really couldn't sit or sleep peacefully! Our colleagues in the store all knew that this matter was wrong, so everyone was flustered, and every day they were in a daze, unable to eat or sleep well.

    On January 4th of this year, the First District Office of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce held an inaugural meeting at the China Grand Theater, and at the same time held a mobilization meeting for anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy. At the meeting, Li Jingren, the head of the First District, Han Shaozeng, the head of the First Sub-bureau of Industry and Commerce, and Wang Guangying, the secretary-general of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, all spoke. They said: The People's Volunteers in Korea climb snow-capped mountains, cross icy rivers, shed blood and sweat, and fight bravely to strike at the enemy. Who are they doing it for? They also said: Stealing state property must be dealt with according to the law. Only by honestly confessing will the government give lenient treatment. At the meeting, we were originally sitting in the seventeenth row, but the more we listened, the more moved we became. We two (Dai Daoyao and Cheng Guoxiang) moved forward and sat next to each other, all the way to the first row. When the speakers finished, we were very anxious, wishing we could go on stage to confess immediately. The closing time had already arrived at that time, and as a result, we did not confess.

    After the meeting, we were really too nervous. That afternoon at 2:30, without even eating a good meal, we rushed to the First District Office of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, found Director Wang Xianzhou of the office, and told him everything in detail. Today (January 7th) at 1:00 p.m., I (Dai Daoyao) rushed to the court again and confessed to stealing more than fifty taels of gold-plated ornaments and four taels of gold extracted from gold-plated jewelry (because it was related to the Li Fengxiang case).

    After confessing and putting down the burden, we felt relaxed and comfortable immediately. We have done things that are sorry for the people and sorry for the country, and we are willing to accept the government's punishment. We also hope that merchants who have made the same mistakes as us will quickly realize their errors, confess, and become new merchants in the new China. (Originally published in Tianjin Daily)

    我们盗窃了国家的金银
    ——天津市恒孚胶鞋店商人戴道尧、程国祥等自述坦白经过
    “若要人不知，除非己莫为。”自己心里有“病”，盗窃了国家的财产，如果自己不讲，知道这件事的人也会讲出来。我们几个人过去就做了不少亏心事。自从反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开以后，每个人的思想上都斗争了很久。说吧，怕受处分；不说吧，又怕将来被人检举出来更难看。我们还是决定说了。因为只有这样做，才对得起国家，对得起人民，也才对得起自己的良心。
    我们原来开的是“恒孚金店”，一九四九年九月转业改为“恒孚百货店”；一九五○年七月间改成“恒孚胶鞋店”。就在一九四九年四月里，华北对外贸易管理局经中国银行天津分行兑换股副股长李凤翔（他已因贪污被政府逮捕）介绍，拿来两千多两黄金，交我们熔化。我们见了黄金，就昧了良心！当时就主使熔金工人用银子偷换了四两黄金。在这年七月，有一个带着“裕大公司”徽章的干部拿来一千多两黄金熔化（那干部说是“禁烟局”的黄金），我们又主使工人偷换了四两。一九五○年四、五月里，这个干部又拿着四五百两黄金来了，我们又偷换了一两。一九五一年三月初，天津市财政局来熔化一千七八百两黄金，我们又偷换了三两。
    还有一次是在一九四九年时，天津市私营金店纷纷转业，中国银行天津分行收兑了大量白银首饰，李凤翔找私营金店化成纯银。当时，他也找了我们。我们又主使工人偷了五十多两包金饰物（其中大部分是白银），并偷了镀金饰物中提炼出来的黄金约四两。前前后后，一共盗窃了国家十六两黄金，五十多两白银。
    一九五一年十一月，李凤翔终因贪污渎职被政府抓了起来，这件事在天津日报上也登了，里面还说到他跟私营金店的关系。我们看到这个消息时，非常害怕。人民法院也传我们去过堂，我们当时却仍旧昧着良心欺骗政府，除了行贿和一切小事以外，什么也没承认。但是从那时候起，心里可就种下了病。每逢报上登什么贪污消息，我们就拼命地翻来翻去地念，可是越念越害怕。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始之后，检举的、坦白的越来越多了，我们也越加不安了。怎么办呢？真是坐卧不宁！我们店里的同仁们，都知道这档子事做得不对，因此个个心慌意乱，每天精神恍恍忽忽的，饭也吃不下去，觉也睡不安稳。
    今年一月四日，市工商联一区办事处在中国大戏院举行成立大会，同时举行了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的动员大会。会上，一区区长李敬仁、工商一分局局长韩绍曾、市工商联秘书长王光英都讲了话。他们讲：人民志愿军在朝鲜爬雪山，过冰河，流血流汗，英勇作战打击敌人。他们为了谁呢？他们也讲到：偷窃国家财产，一定要法办，只有自己老老实实地坦白出来，政府才会从宽处理。我们在会场上，原来坐在第十七排，后来越听心里越感动，我们两个（戴道尧、程国祥）就挨着往前排坐，一直坐到第一排。讲话的人都讲完了，我们心里可折腾起来了，恨不得马上上台去坦白。当时闭会的时间已经到了，结果又没有坦白。
    散会以后，我们实在太紧张了。当天下午两点半，饭也没吃好，我们就赶着到了工商联一区办事处，找到了办事处的王仙舟主任，一五一十地把事情都给他讲了。今天（一月七日）下午一点钟，我（戴道尧）又赶到了法院，把偷盗包金饰物五十多两和由镀金手饰提炼出来的黄金四两的事，也坦白了（因和李凤翔案有关）。
    坦白出来，放下了包袱，真是一身轻快，心里立时就舒服了。我们做了对不起人民、对不起国家的事，我们甘愿领受政府的处罚。我们还希望跟我们有同样错误的商户也赶快觉悟，坦白出来，做一个新中国的新商人。　（原载天津日报）
