    The methods used by Kovalev to summarize and promote the Stakhanov method are being widely adopted in Soviet production departments. In the Sverdlovsk Oblast, the operational methods of 1,100 Stakhanovite workers at the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant were studied in 1951. The summarization and promotion of advanced operational methods saved enterprises a total of more than 300,000 standard hours. For example, steelworkers in Serov City, by summarizing and promoting the methods of fast steelmaking workers, tapped steel one hour earlier per furnace in November 1951 than the average for the same month in 1950.

    When absorbing various advanced experiences, Soviet Stakhanovites always try to adapt them to the specific conditions of their enterprises and often develop them based on these specific conditions and their own experience. This is one reason why the advanced production experiences of the Soviet Union emerge in an endless stream and are constantly enriched. This is the origin of the new initiative recently proposed by workers in the Ural machinery manufacturing industry, creatively developing the Kovalev method, to comprehensively summarize and promote Stakhanov experiences.

    The basic content of the new initiative is to study, summarize, and promote the achievements of advanced workers not only in production operations, but also in all aspects of improving labor productivity, reducing costs, improving product quality, saving raw and other materials, and using equipment and production sites more rationally. This initiative was proposed by Stakhanovite workers from the Sverdlovsk Pneumatic Machinery Manufacturing Plant and the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant.

    Workers at the Pneumatic Machinery Manufacturing Plant have been conducting various competitions. However, many workers only mastered a certain aspect of the production target. Some workers paid attention to high-speed cutting but relaxed the saving of materials; some workers exceeded the quota but reduced quality. Young lathe operators Protasov and Kireev saw this situation and suggested that engineers and technicians should help workers summarize the Stakhanov experience accumulated in the competition in all aspects of production targets, and comprehensively apply the summarized experience to every production operation. This idea of creatively developing the Kovalev method was supported by the factory leadership, and mechanical technician Shirov, statistician Barkov, and lathe operator Protasov were assigned to be responsible for this work. They studied the operation methods of many lathe operators in the factory and found that Kireev and Gorteev's operation methods had the highest productivity, so they drew their experience into technical diagrams according to the Kovalev method. After research, they also found that Kireev was the best at rationally using the lathe, Kungurov was the best at producing high-quality products, Kutsnetsov was the best at organizing work positions, Lubensky was the best at saving materials, and Barzhnev was the best at saving auxiliary materials. They drew the working methods of these advanced lathe operators into diagrams one by one, and then made a general diagram based on these diagrams. The general diagram comprehensively summarized the Stakhanov experience of all production targets in the entire factory. Then, the factory organized a Stakhanov worker school with on-site lectures, where Stakhanovite workers explained their experience according to the diagrams.

    The famous Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant has widely promoted the Kovalev method, thus improving the skills of thousands of workers and increasing production quotas. However, in the past, only operation methods were summarized, and the Stakhanov experience of each production target was not summarized, although advanced workers and production teams have accumulated a lot of experience in these areas. Forger Oleinikov and first-class technician Pozdeyev thought: The Party and the government are calling on participants in the competition to pay attention to comprehensive production targets, and it is necessary to apply all the beneficial experiences of advanced workers and technicians to production. Therefore, similar to the production innovators of the Pneumatic Machinery Manufacturing Plant, they proposed an initiative to master comprehensive Stakhanov technology. They also adopted the method of summarizing experience, drawing technical diagrams, and coaching on the spot. The diagrams summarized Stakhanov work methods for each production target. According to the diagrams, each worker can master the operation methods with the highest productivity, and at the same time learn the best experience of saving materials, correctly using working time, equipment, and tools, as well as the rationalized actions of manufacturing parts.

    The method of comprehensively summarizing and promoting the Stakhanov experience enabled a main workshop of the Pneumatic Machinery Manufacturing Plant to reduce the cost of manufacturing parts by 10 percent, reduce waste by half, and increase output by 30 percent, and it was awarded the title of "Collective Stakhanovite Workshop." This method has also yielded significant results at the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant. It has been successfully applied to the metallurgical, coal mining, timber and other industrial sectors in the Sverdlovsk Oblast. At the experience exchange conference in Sverdlovsk Oblast on December 7th last year, engineer Kovalev highly evaluated it. This method is now being promoted throughout the Soviet Union.

    苏联全面总结和推广斯塔哈诺夫经验的方法
    新华社驻莫斯科记者  李何
    郭瓦廖夫总结和推广斯塔哈诺夫操作的方法，在苏联生产部门被广泛地采用着。在斯维德洛夫斯克州，一九五一年曾经研究乌拉尔重型机械制造厂一千一百个斯塔哈诺夫式工人的操作方法。总结和推广先进的操作方法，使各企业总共节约了三十万标准小时以上。例如，塞罗夫城的炼钢工人由于总结和推广了快速炼钢工人的方法，一九五一年十一月比一九五零年同月平均每一炉提前一小时出钢。
    苏联斯塔哈诺夫工作者在吸取各种先进经验时，总是想法使它适用于自己企业的具体条件，并且时常根据这些具体条件和自身的经验加以发展。这就是苏联先进生产经验之所以源源不绝地出现和不断丰富起来的一个原因。这就是最近乌拉尔机器制造业工人创造性地发展郭瓦廖夫方法，提出全面总结和推广斯塔哈诺夫经验的新创议的由来。
    新创议的基本内容就是：不仅在生产操作方面，而且在提高劳动生产率、减低成本、改善产品质量、节约原料和材料、更合理地使用装备和生产场所各方面，来研究、总结和推广先进工人的成就。这个创议是由斯维德洛夫斯克气力机器制造厂和乌拉尔重型机械制造厂的斯塔哈诺夫工作者提出来的。
    气力机器制造厂的工人曾经进行各种竞赛。但是许多工人只掌握了生产标志的某一方面，有些工人注意了高速切削法，却放松了节约材料；有些工人超过了定额，却减低了质量。青年镟盘工人普罗塔索夫、基列耶夫看到这种情形，就提出意见，要求工程师和技师帮助工人总结竞赛中所积累的生产标志各方面的斯塔哈诺夫经验，把总结后的经验全面地采用到每一个生产操作中去。这种创造性地发展郭瓦廖夫方法的意见，受到了工厂领导方面的支持，派机械技师薛罗夫、统计员柏科夫和镟盘工人普罗塔索夫负责这个工作。他们研究了厂内许多镟盘工人的操作方法，发现了基列耶夫和高尔捷耶夫两个人的操作方法生产率最高，就按照郭瓦廖夫方法把他们的经验绘成技术图解。他们经过研究，也发现了基列耶夫最会合理地使用镟床，孔古罗夫最会出产优等产品，库茨湼左夫最会组织工作位置，卢边斯基最会节约材料，巴尔知内最会节约辅助材料。他们把这些先进镟盘工人的工作方法一一绘成图解，根据这些图解，再制出总的图解。总的图解全面地归纳了全厂生产各标志的斯塔哈诺夫经验。然后工厂组织了当场讲授的斯塔哈诺夫工作者学校，由斯塔哈诺夫式工人按图讲解经验。
    著名的乌拉尔重型机械制造厂曾经广泛地推行郭瓦廖夫方法，因而提高了几千工人的熟练程度，增加了生产定额。但是以前只总结操作方法，而没有总结生产各标志的斯塔哈诺夫经验，虽然先进的工人和生产组在这些方面积累有很多经验。该厂锻工奥列依尼科夫和一等技师波兹杰也夫心里想：党和政府正号召参加竞赛者注意全面的生产标志，需要把先进工人和技术人员的一切有益经验运用到生产上去。因此和气力机器制造厂生产革新者相类似，他们提出了掌握全面斯塔哈诺夫技术的创议。他们也是采取总结经验，绘成技术图解，当场教练的办法。图解中归纳了生产各标志上的斯塔哈诺夫工作方法。每个工人根据图解可以精通生产率最高的操作方法，同时可以学会节约材料，正确利用工作时间、装备、工具的最好经验，以及制造零件的合理化动作。
    全面总结和推广斯塔哈诺夫经验的方法，使气力机器制造厂的一个主要车间所制造的零件，成本减低了百分之十，废品减少了一半，产量提高了百分之三十，而得到“集体斯塔哈诺夫式车间”的称号。这个方法在乌拉尔重型机械制造厂也得出显著的成绩。它已经被成功地运用到斯维德洛夫斯克州的冶金、采煤、木材等工业部门去。在去年十二月七日斯维德洛夫斯克州交换经验的大会上，郭瓦廖夫工程师很高地评价了它。现在这个方法正向全苏联推广中。
