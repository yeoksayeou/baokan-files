Repentance is Salvation
Li Ji

Wang Yunzhang, a procurement officer at the Central People's Government Fuel Industry Ministry's Electrical Management Bureau, was a retained employee from the previous regime. Before liberation, he was well-acquainted with the managers of Beijing's Lihua Factory and Licheng Factory, and he always gave them priority when there was work to be done. They, in turn, constantly gave him money and treated him to meals. After liberation, he placed several orders with Lihua Factory. During the Mid-Autumn Festival of 1949, the manager of Lihua Factory gave him 200,000 yuan. Subsequently, they continuously gave Wang Yunzhang 1 million yuan, 2 million yuan, and 4.5 million yuan, totaling more than 13.3 million yuan, in addition to two bags of flour, four bolts of cloth, and twelve silver dollars. As a result, whenever the bureau had work, Wang Yunzhang would notify Lihua Factory.

In May 1951, the bureau began its cadre review and study program. Wang Yunzhang felt conflicted and called the manager of Licheng Factory to his home to discuss whether or not to confess. The manager of Licheng Factory said, "You don't need to confess. Only you and I know about our affairs, and I guarantee they won't find out." Wang also consulted with Zhang Jiyao, the manager of Lihua Factory. Zhang also said, "There are no loopholes, I assure you." Wang decided not to say anything, but after being enlightened by his comrades, he felt uneasy and went to discuss it with Zhang Jiyao again. Zhang impatiently said, "You're really something, what are you afraid of?" He also said, "If you embezzle 4 million yuan, you should be shot, and you have embezzled 10 or 20 million yuan, which is no small amount. If you confess, can you handle it?" Before leaving, he left Wang Yunzhang another 1 million yuan. Wang said, "Why are you giving me this?" Zhang said, "This is a personal matter!"

Wang Yunzhang didn't say anything, but his heart was always pounding. So he came up with a plan: to confess everything about Licheng Factory, since all the dealings with Licheng Factory had occurred before liberation. Then he would mention that the manager of Lihua Factory had given him some gifts, but not mention giving him money, so that his self-criticism would be very "profound"! Once he decided, he did just that. The cadre review movement focused on historical issues, and his embezzlement problem was glossed over.

Was Wang Yunzhang finished just because he didn't confess during the cadre review movement? According to the奸商 (guilty merchant) Zhang Jiyao, it seemed to be over. Zhang said, "How about it? You didn't confess and nothing happened; if you had confessed, you would have gone to court immediately." In fact, things were not so simple. Wang Yunzhang thought of an old saying: "If you don't want anyone to know, don't do it." Not confessing to embezzlement would not bring peace of mind. He couldn't eat or sleep, and he was always thinking about it day and night. He asked his wife, "I haven't left any traces, why am I still like this?" His wife said, "Who told us to commit a crime!" Then he felt a little regretful. "If I had confessed during the cadre review movement, wouldn't I be at ease now?"

In December 1951, the Three-Anti Campaign (anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy) began. Wang Yunzhang's pain intensified. He went to see Zhang Jiyao, the manager of Lihua Factory, again. Zhang said, "Don't say anything, or you'll go to court. If the government comes to investigate me, I will resolutely deny it." Wang thought, "You may be confident, but I'm not." He wanted to confess, but he was afraid of losing face and being sent to court, leaving his wife and four children at home. How would they survive? His wife encouraged him and said, "Don't worry about us, I have two hands, I can knit. The older children can set up a small stall. As long as you throw away this 'burden of sin,' that's all that matters." His wife also said, "Think about how much pain you've suffered in the past few months! Quickly confess, it's right to go to jail, who told us to commit a crime!" Wang Yunzhang couldn't make up his mind. His wife said again, "The government and Chairman Mao are afraid that our sins will become deeper and reach an irreparable state, that's why they're doing this. If you don't turn back now, there really won't be another chance."

That was it. If he didn't turn back, there really wouldn't be another chance. Wang Yunzhang thought that for months, he had been unable to eat or sleep because of this matter, and he was always on edge, suspecting this person and that person, without a moment of peace. It was like a life sentence! It would be better to confess and go to court. In this state of mind, Wang Yunzhang decided to confess.

December 17th was the first day for employees of the Electrical Management Bureau to study and confess their problems in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. On this day, Wang Yunzhang confessed all the facts of his embezzlement at the study group meeting. He also denounced the guilty merchants who had repeatedly obstructed and intimidated him from confessing. To his surprise, the leaders not only did not immediately send him to court, but also comforted and encouraged him, and decided to reduce his punishment. Based on Wang Yunzhang's confession, the People's Government arrested the guilty merchant Zhang Jiyao. (Xinhua News Agency)

    回头是岸
    李冀
    中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局采购员王蕴章是一个留用人员。他在解放前，就跟北京利华工厂和力成工厂的经理熟识，有活总是先让他们两家做。他们也不断地给他送点钱，请请客。解放后，他又向利华工厂订了几次货。一九四九年中秋节时，利华工厂经理给他送来了二十万元，以后又接连不断地给王蕴章送一百万元、二百万元、四百五十万元，一共有一千三百三十多万元，另外还有二袋面、四匹布、十二块银元等。这样，每逢局里有活，王蕴章就通知利华工厂。
    一九五一年五月里，局里开始审干学习。王蕴章心里矛盾开了，叫力成工厂的经理到他家，商量坦白不坦白。力成工厂的经理说：“你不要坦白，我们的事只有你我两人知道，我保险他们查不出来。”王又和利华工厂经理张继尧商量。张也说：“保险没有漏洞。”王决定不说了，但他经过同志们的启发，心中总是不安，又去和张继尧商量，张不耐烦地说：“你这个人真是的，怕什么？”又说：“贪污四百万元就该枪毙啦，你贪污了一两千万元，这个数目可不小，说出来，你受得了吗？”临走时，又给王蕴章留下一百万元。王说：“怎么还来这个呢？”张说：“这是私人关系！”
    王蕴章嘴里不说，心可老是扑通通地跳。于是他就想起了一个办法：把力成工厂的事情全部谈出来，好在和力成工厂的事情都是在解放前干的。然后再谈一下利华工厂经理给我送点礼，不谈给过我钱，这样不就检讨的很“深刻”了吗！他决定后就这样做了。审干运动着重在历史问题，他的贪污问题就混了过去。
    王蕴章在审干运动中没坦白，是不是就算完了呢？按照奸商张继尧的话来说好像是完了，张说：“怎么样？你不坦白没事；你要是坦白了，马上就到法院了。”其实，事情并不那么简单，王蕴章想起了一句老话：“若要人不知，除非己莫为。”做了贪污的事情不坦白，是不会安心的。他吃不下去饭，睡不着觉，白天黑夜老是想着这件事。他问老婆：“我一点痕迹都没有了，为什么还这样呢？”老婆说：“谁让我们犯罪呢！”于是他又有点后悔了。“要是在审干运动中坦白了，不就踏实了吗？”
    一九五一年十二月，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始了。王蕴章的痛苦更大了。他又找利华工厂的经理张继尧，张说：“千万不要说，说了就要进法院。政府如果来调查我，我坚决不说。”王心想：“你有把握，我可没把握。”他想谈，又怕丢人，并且怕说了就要进法院，家中留下老婆和四个小孩，怎么生活呢？他老婆当下鼓励了他，并且说：“你不要管我们，我有两只手，可以织毛活。大孩子还可以摆个小摊。只要你把这个‘罪包’扔掉就好了。”他老婆还说：“你想想，这几个月你受了多大的痛苦！赶快把事情谈出来吧，坐监牢也是应当的，谁让我们犯了罪啊！”王蕴章没拿定主意。他老婆又说：“政府和毛主席怕我们罪孽越来越深，到了不可收拾的地步，才来这一下子。如果再不回头，可真的没机会了。”
    事情就是这样，再不回头，可真是再没有机会了。王蕴章想，几个月来，自己为这件事吃不下饭，睡不好觉，成天提心吊胆地提防这个，怀疑那个，没有一点痛快的时候。这简直是无期徒刑！与其这样，还不如谈出来进法院好。在这样的心情下，王蕴章决定坦白了。
    十二月十七日，是电业管理总局职工进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义学习交代问题的第一天。就在这一天，王蕴章在学习小组会上坦白了他贪污的全部事实。并且检举了屡次阻挠、恫吓他坦白的奸商。出他意料之外，领导方面不但没有马上把他送到法院，并且安慰他、鼓励他，决定减轻对他的处分。人民政府并根据王蕴章的坦白事实，逮捕了奸商张继尧。（新华社）
