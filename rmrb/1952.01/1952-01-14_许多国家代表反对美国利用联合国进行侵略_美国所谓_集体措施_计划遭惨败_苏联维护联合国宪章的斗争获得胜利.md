Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 13th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its meetings on the 5th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, concluding the discussion on the report of the so-called "Collective Measures Committee" and conducting voting. The progress of the discussion and the voting results indicate that the United States' plan to have the Political Committee adopt the report of the so-called "Collective Measures Committee" and the eleven-nation proposal has suffered a serious defeat. As is well known, the purpose of this report and proposal is to undermine the UN Charter, transfer the rights and powers of the Security Council to the General Assembly (where the United States can manipulate a majority to pass any decisions it needs to support its aggression plans), and illegally demand that UN member states provide armed forces to be commanded by the UN General Assembly.

The historical lesson of the United States' illegal use of the UN flag as a cover to carry out heinous armed intervention in Korea, and the historical lesson of the American aggressors' attempt to enslave the heroic Korean people and turn Korea into a bridgehead for the further realization of US imperialist plans without success, have had a great impact on the countries of the US-British bloc in the United Nations. Even the delegations of those countries that fawn on the United States have seen that the US's so-called "collective measures" plan is an attempt to drag their countries into a military gamble similar to the US armed intervention in Korea. The delegations of these countries have indicated that they would rather not participate in this kind of deal.

In the course of the discussion, although a large number of countries in the US-British bloc did not dare to completely oppose the US's so-called "collective measures" plan, they put forward many significant amendments to the eleven-nation proposal. The purpose of these amendments was to ensure that their own countries would not be dragged into the US's aggression gamble under the banner of "collective measures." Among these amendments, some even advocated fundamentally canceling the section of the eleven-nation proposal that required the adoption of the "Collective Measures Committee" report, and only recording the report in the minutes of the General Assembly. At the daily meetings, although the representatives of many countries in the US-British bloc still expressed "general" support for the US's so-called "collective measures" in their speeches, when it came to providing their countries' resources and soldiers as "contributions" to these measures, they universally emphasized that their own countries' special circumstances were not suitable for participating in these "collective measures." Even some countries that have always unreservedly supported the United States' various acts of aggression were no exception.

The Iranian representative said in his speech: Iran must concentrate its efforts on improving Iran's backward economic situation. Iran must consider this point when deciding whether to participate in "collective measures."

The South African Federation representative's speech was also the same.

The Israeli representative said: Israel cannot place any of its troops under the command of the United Nations. He expressed his support for the Soviet proposal advocating that the Security Council convene regular meetings.

The Iraqi representative openly expressed doubts about whether "collective measures" could promote peace. He said that he did not believe the words of the drafters of the so-called "collective measures" plan. He emphasized that the principle of unanimity among the major powers, which is the foundation of the UN Charter, must be restored. He also expressed his support for the Soviet proposal to recommend that the Security Council immediately convene regular meetings.

The Argentine representative said unequivocally in his speech: The purpose of the report of the so-called "Collective Measures Committee" and the eleven-nation proposal is to greatly amend the Charter, first of all to abolish the principle of unanimity among the major powers in resolving non-procedural issues. This is what the Argentine representative once openly suggested to do, but Argentina's proposal has been rejected, and the Charter has not been amended. Therefore, the suggestion that the armed forces of UN member states should be handed over to the command of the General Assembly is unacceptable.

The Indian representative's speech reflected the position taken by many UN member states. He said: As early as the 1950 UN General Assembly, the Indian delegation refused to support the "United Action for Peace" resolution, because the meaning of that proposal was to enable the United Nations to establish an agency to implement compulsory sanctions without giving due attention to the peaceful resolution of issues that cause disputes. According to the UN Charter, only the Security Council can decide who threatens peace and make decisions based on this judgment. The General Assembly's recommendations on such issues are not binding. If only a part of the countries implement this recommendation, and other countries, including some major powers, do not agree with this recommendation, it will only make the crisis of war more serious. Therefore, the Indian delegation will abstain when voting on the eleven-nation proposal.

At the morning session on the 7th, the US delegation and the delegations of other countries that participated in drafting the report of the so-called "Collective Measures Committee" and the eleven-nation proposal, seeing that their plan to have the Political Committee adopt the above-mentioned report and proposal was about to fail, expressed their support for several amendments to the eleven-nation proposal put forward by Latin American and Near Eastern countries, attempting to save face for themselves. They even accepted the amendment requesting the General Assembly not to adopt the "Collective Measures Committee" report.

At the afternoon session on the 7th, Vyshinsky summarized the results of the discussion. He emphasized that many delegations held an opposing attitude towards the eleven-nation proposal recommending the approval of the conclusions of the so-called "Collective Measures" Committee. Certain delegations, such as the delegations of Colombia, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, and Peru, have always unreservedly supported all measures of the North Atlantic group headed by the United States, but this time they could not hide their dissatisfaction with the report of the "Collective Measures Committee" and the eleven-nation proposal. This dissatisfaction was manifested in the rather important amendments made to the above-mentioned proposal by the Arab countries, Afghanistan, and certain Latin American countries. Now, the drafters of the "Collective Measures Committee" report and the eleven-nation proposal have had to accept these amendments, even an amendment advocating not approving the report of the so-called "Collective Measures" Committee, and this report is precisely an important part of this proposal. This matter most clearly proves the failure of this proposal.

At the morning session on the 8th, when the Political Committee had concluded the general debate and was about to vote on the proposals of all parties, the representatives of various countries still stated their reasons for voting one after another, expressing a stronger resistance to the US plan. Representatives of Venezuela, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Chile, Iceland, Sweden, and many other countries requested that even the already revised eleven-nation proposal be further revised. They feared that even after adopting the original amendments, whether any loopholes would still be left, allowing the United States to raise some requirements on the UN member states regarding participation in the so-called "collective measures". Even the representative of Venezuela, one of the co-sponsors of the eleven-nation proposal, believed that it was necessary to remind the Political Committee that the possibility of transferring Venezuelan troops outside the country was extremely limited. The representative of the Dominican Republic said that his country, when considering participating in "collective measures", should proceed from the point of view that its national resources should first be used to meet domestic needs. The representatives of Iceland and Costa Rica said that their countries simply had no soldiers to transfer abroad. The Swedish representative frankly warned the Political Committee that Swedish law prohibits the transfer of troops abroad, therefore, Sweden could not send any armed forces to participate in "collective measures."

In addition to the amendments previously proposed, the Chilean and Colombian delegations put forward another amendment, suggesting that the part of item six of the eleven-nation proposal that allows countries belonging to certain international organizations or participating in certain international agreements to individually participate in the so-called "collective measures" should be deleted. This amendment aroused great interest among the delegations of various countries, especially among the Latin American countries participating in the so-called "Pan-American Convention," so that US representative Cohen had to hurriedly stand up and "issue a warning," indicating that the concessions of the US delegation and other supporters of the eleven-nation proposal had reached the final limit.

The representatives of Afghanistan, Burma, Argentina, and Guatemala made several major reservations regarding the eleven-nation proposal. The representative of Afghanistan said: Afghanistan does not intend to designate any troops to participate in the planned "collective measures." The representative of Indonesia said that he was not prepared to vote in favor of the eleven-nation proposal, because the adoption of this proposal could only deepen the rift between major powers, thereby exacerbating international tensions. The Burmese representative also stated that his government could not send any armed forces to participate in such collective measures. He also pointed out that the Burmese delegation opposes considering participation in these measures as an obligation of UN member states.

At the afternoon session on the 8th, a vote was held on the proposals and amendments put forward by all parties. The first item of the Soviet proposal, which suggested canceling the so-called "Collective Measures Committee," was first put to a vote and was rejected by a majority vote. Five delegations (the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Ukrainian Republic, and the Byelorussian Republic) voted in favor, and two delegations (India and Indonesia) abstained.

Then, the eleven-nation revised proposal was put to a vote. This proposal included amendments that refused to adopt the report of the "Collective Measures Committee" and gave UN member states the right not to participate in the so-called "collective measures." Fifty-one delegations voted in favor of this proposal, five delegations (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia) voted against, and three delegations (India, Indonesia, and Argentina) abstained because they were unwilling to support this amended proposal. When voting on the eleven-nation proposal item by item, the largest number of votes were in favor of those articles that included the amendments proposed by the delegations. Therefore, although the eleven-nation proposal has been passed, the result of the discussion shows that the US adventure in the so-called "collective measures" has suffered a disastrous defeat.

At the morning session on the 9th, a vote was held on the Soviet proposal. This proposal pointed out in the preamble that the basic task of the United Nations is to achieve and strengthen international peace and security, and according to the UN Charter, the main responsibility for maintaining international peace and security has been entrusted to the Security Council. The Soviet proposal recommended: canceling the Collective Measures Committee; recommending that the Security Council immediately convene regular meetings to discuss measures that can eliminate tensions in international relations, and first discuss measures to help the Korean armistice negotiations achieve a successful conclusion.

The United States, Britain, France, and Brazil proposed an amendment to the Soviet proposal, suggesting deleting the first item of the Soviet proposal requesting the cancellation of the "Collective Measures Committee," suggesting deleting the word "immediately" in the second item of the Soviet proposal regarding the immediate convening of regular meetings of the Security Council, and opposing discussing the Korean issue at the regular meetings of the Security Council. In this way, the Soviet proposal finally retained only the preamble and half of the second item. When voting, fifty votes were in favor of the entire Soviet proposal after the amendment, there were no opposing votes, and eight delegations abstained.

After the vote, Vyshinsky spoke, explaining the reasons for the Soviet vote in favor. He pointed out that although the amendment proposed by the four countries had greatly damaged the Soviet proposal, even after the proposal of this amendment, the Soviet proposal was still valid, and the Soviet Union would use every opportunity to strive for the implementation of this proposal. He particularly pointed out that the preamble of the Soviet proposal, which is of extreme importance, has been passed. In this preamble, the extremely important principle that is the basis of the UN Charter, that is, the Security Council should bear the main responsibility for maintaining peace and security, has been reaffirmed.

After some other representatives explained their voting motivations, the chairman announced that the discussion on the report of the so-called "Collective Measures Committee" was now concluded.

    许多国家代表反对美国利用联合国进行侵略
    美国所谓“集体措施”计划遭惨败
    苏联维护联合国宪章的斗争获得胜利
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会政治委员会在五日、七日、八日和九日继续举行会议，结束了关于所谓“集体措施委员会”的报告的讨论，并进行了表决。讨论的进程和表决结果表明：美国企图使政治委员会通过所谓“集体措施委员会”报告和十一国提案的计划，已遭到了严重的失败。如所周知，这个报告和提案的目的，是要破坏联合国宪章，把安全理事会的权利和权力移交给大会（在那里，美国可以操纵多数通过它所需要的任何决定来支持它的侵略计划），并非法要求联合国会员国提供武装部队，交由联合国大会指挥。
    美国非法地利用联合国旗帜作为幌子在朝鲜实行罪大恶极的武装干涉一事的历史教训，美国侵略者企图奴役英勇的朝鲜人民、企图把朝鲜变成桥头堡以便进一步实现美帝国主义的计划而没有得逞的历史教训，对联合国美英集团各国产生了极大的影响，就连向美国摇尾乞怜的那些国家的代表团，也看出了美国的所谓“集体措施”的计划，是企图把它们的国家拖进与美国在朝鲜的武装干涉相类似的军事赌博。这些国家的代表团表示宁愿不参加这种勾当。
    在讨论的进程中，大量美英集团的国家虽然还不敢彻底反对美国的所谓“集体措施”计划，但是对十一国提案提出了许多重大的修正案，这些修正案的目的，是保障它们本国不会在“集体措施”的招牌下被卷入美国的侵略赌博中去。在这些修正案中，有的甚至主张把十一国提案中要求通过“集体措施委员会”报告的一段根本取消，而只把这个报告载入大会议事记录了事。在连日会议上，许多美英集团国家的代表发言时虽然还“一般地”表示支持美国的所谓“集体措施”，但是在谈到提供各国的资源和士兵作为对这种措施的“贡献”时，却普遍强调它们本国的特殊情况不宜于参加这种“集体措施”。甚至有些一向毫无保留地支持美国各种侵略行动的国家也不例外。
    伊朗代表在发言中说：伊朗必须集中力量改进伊朗经济的落后状态。伊朗在决定是否参加“集体措施”的时候，要从这一点出发来考虑。
    南非联邦代表的发言，论调也是一样。
    以色列代表说：以色列不能把它的任何军队置于联合国的指挥之下。他表示赞成苏联提案中主张由安全理事会召开定期会议的建议。
    伊拉克代表对于“集体措施”能否促成和平公开表示怀疑，他说，他不相信所谓“集体措施”计划的起草人的话。他强调作为联合国宪章之基础的大国一致的原则必须恢复。他也表示支持苏联提案中关于建议安全理事会立刻召开定期会议的建议。
    阿根廷代表在发言时毫不含糊地说：所谓“集体措施”委员会的报告和十一国提案的目的是要大大修改宪章，首先是要废除安全理事会在解决非程序问题时的大国一致原则，这是阿根廷代表一度公开建议过要做的事情，但是，阿根廷的这个提案已被否决了，宪章也没有修改，因此，联合国会员国的武装部队应交给大会指挥的建议是不能够接受的。
    印度代表的发言反映了联合国很多会员国所采取的立场。他说：早在一九五○年的联合国大会上，印度代表团就拒绝支持“保障和平的联合行动”案，因为那个提案的意思就是要使联合国建立施行强制制裁的机构，而对于和平解决引起争端的问题却不予以适当的注意。按照联合国宪章，只有安全理事会才能决定谁威胁和平，并根据这种判断采取决定。大会在这种问题上的建议，不能具有约束性。如果只有一部分国家实践这种建议，而其他国家，包括某些大国在内，不赞成这种建议，那就只会使战争的危机更加严重。因此，印度代表团在表决十一国提案的时候要弃权。
    在七日上午会议上，美国代表团和参与草拟所谓“集体措施委员会”报告及十一国提案的其他各国代表团，看到它们企图使政治委员会通过上述报告和提案的计划即将失败，因此，就表示支持若干拉丁美洲和近东国家对十一国提案提出的修正案，企图给自己挽回面子。它们甚至接受了要求大会不通过“集体措施委员会”报告的修正案。
    在七日下午会议上，维辛斯基总结了讨论的结果。他着重指出：对于建议批准所谓“集体措施”委员会的结论的十一国提案，许多代表团抱着反对态度。某些代表团，例如哥伦比亚、墨西哥、智利、阿根廷和秘鲁的代表团，一向就是毫无保留地支持以美国为首的北大西洋集团的一切措施的，然而这一次却不能掩饰他们对“集体措施委员会”报告和十一国提案的不满了。在阿拉伯国家、阿富汗和某些拉丁美洲国家对上述提案所提出的颇为重要的修正案中，都表现了这种不满。现在，“集体措施委员会”报告和十一国提案的起草人已不得不接受这些修正案，甚至连一条主张不批准所谓“集体措施”委员会的报告的修正案也接受了，而这个报告却正是这个提案中的一个重要部分。这件事最明显地证明了这个提案的失败。
    在八日上午会议上，当政治委员会已经结束了一般辩论而即将对各方提案进行表决时，各国代表还是纷纷申述投票理由，对美国计划表示了更加强烈的反抗。委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚、多米尼加共和国、智利、冰岛、瑞典以及其他许多国家的代表，都要求甚至把已经经过修改的十一国提案再加修改，他们害怕即使采纳了原有的修正案以后，是否还会留下什么漏洞，使美国能够对联合国各会员国提出关于参加所谓“集体措施”的什么要求来。甚至连十一国提案的共同提案国之一的委内瑞拉的代表也认为必须提醒政治委员会：把委内瑞拉的军队调出国境的可能性是极端有限的。多米尼加共和国的代表说：他的国家在考虑参加“集体措施”的问题时，当从本国资源首先应用以满足国内需要的观点出发。冰岛和哥斯达黎加的代表们说，他们的国家根本没有士兵可以调到国外去。瑞典代表率直地警告政治委员会说：瑞典的法律禁止把军队调到国外去，因此，瑞典就不能派遣任何武装部队去参加“集体措施”。
    智利和哥伦比亚代表团在以前所提的修正案以外，又提出了一个修正案，建议从十一国提案的第六项中删除允许属于某些国际机构或参加某些国际协定的国家个别参加所谓“集体措施”的那一部分，这个修正案在各国代表团中间，特别是在参加所谓“泛美公约”的拉丁美洲国家中间，引起了极大的兴趣，以至于美国代表柯亨不得不急忙起来“提出警告”，表示美国代表团和十一国提案的其他支持者的让步已到了最后限度。
    阿富汗、缅甸、阿根廷和危地马拉的代表对于十
    一国提案作了若干重大保留。阿富汗代表说：阿富汗不打算指派任何军队参与计划中的“集体措施”。印度尼西亚代表说，他不准备投票赞成十一国提案，因为通过这个提案只可能加深大国间的裂痕，从而使国际紧张局势更加恶化。缅甸代表也表示，他的政府不可能派遣任何武装部队参与这种集体措施。他并且指出：缅甸代表团反对把参与这些措施视为联合国会员国的义务。
    八日下午会议就各方所提出的提案和修正案举行了表决。苏联提案中建议取消所谓“集体措施委员会”的第一项首先付表决，结果以多数票被否决。五个代表团（苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰共和国和白俄罗斯共和国）投票赞成，两个代表团
    （印度和印度尼西亚）弃权。
    然后，十一国的修正提案被提付表决，这个提案中包括拒绝通过“集体措施委员会”的报告并给予联合国会员国以权利不参与所谓“集体措施”的修正案。五十一个代表团投票赞成这个提案，五个代表团（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克）投票反对，三个代表团（印度、印度尼西亚和阿根廷）因为不愿支持这个修正的提案而弃权。在逐条表决十一国提案时，最大多数的票数都赞成包括各代表团所提的修正案的那些条文。因此，尽管十一国提案已被通过，讨论结果却表明，美国在所谓“集体措施”方面所进行的冒险已遭到惨败。
    九日上午会议对苏联提案举行表决。这个提案在序言中指出，联合国的基本任务是获致并加强国际和平与安全，根据联合国宪章，维护国际和平与安全的主要责任已赋予安全理事会。苏联提案建议：取消集体措施委员会；建议安全理事会立刻召开定期会议，讨论足以消除国际关系中紧张局势的措施，并首先讨论帮助朝鲜停战谈判获得顺利结束的措施。
    美、英、法、巴西四国对苏联提案提出修正案，建议删去苏联提案中要求取消“集体措施委员会”的第一项，建议在苏联提案关于立刻召开安全理事会定期会议的第二项中删去“立刻”的字样，并且反对在安全理事会定期会议上讨论朝鲜问题。这样，苏联提案最后还剩下了序言和第二项的一半。在进行表决时，有五十票赞成修正后的整个苏联提案，没有反对票，有八个代表团弃权。
    在表决以后，维辛斯基发言，说明苏联投赞成票的理由。他指出，虽然四国提出的修正案已经大大破坏了苏联提案，然而，甚至在提出这个修正案以后，苏联的提案还是有效的，苏联将利用一切机会为实现这个提案而努力。他特别指出，具有极端重要性的苏联提案的序言已经通过了，在这个序言中，作为联合国宪章的基础的极端重要的原则，即应由安全理事会负维护和平与安全的主要责任这一点，已重新被确认。
    在其他一些代表们说明了他们投票的动机后，主席即宣布关于所谓“集体措施委员会”的报告的讨论至此结束。
