Xinhua News Agency Report

The U.S. Side Actually Used Perfunctorily Filled Forms to Impersonate "Letters Home" from Our Captured Personnel

[Xinhua News Agency, 2nd] Our special correspondent reported from Kaesong on the 31st: On this last day of 1951, people still could not hear the news of the Korean armistice negotiations reaching an agreement from Panmunjom. This negotiation, which lasted for one hundred and seventy-five days, has not yet reached an agreement due to the U.S. side repeatedly setting obstacles on the road to negotiation.

The Korean-Chinese side always considers the thousands of prisoners of war and their families. One day after Christmas, they handed over 803 letters handwritten by American, British, and other prisoners of war to the U.S. representative, Libby, hoping that he would quickly forward them to the prisoners' families to bring them holiday joy. On New Year's Eve in 1951, the Korean-Chinese side again handed over 980 letters from American, British, and other prisoners of war to the U.S. side. If these letters are not hindered and can be quickly transferred to the recipients, then in the New Year of 1952, some family members of American and British prisoners will be happy to receive these letters.

As of the 31st, the Korean-Chinese side had only received a small number of "letters home" from the North Korean and Chinese captured personnel forwarded by the U.S. representative. Among a batch of "letters home" received on December 26th, only 43 were sent to China. These letters were written on printed 32mo cards. The front of the card has columns for the sender to fill in their name, place of origin, prisoner number, place of sending, and the recipient's name, address, and nationality. The back is blank for writing the letter. The impression gained after reading these cards is that these cards are more like perfunctorily filled forms than letters. Everyone knows that Chinese people do not celebrate Christmas, but the American generals forced their own habits on the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Thirty-nine of the forty-three cards had the seven characters "Celebrating Christmas, I am fine" written on them, and these seven characters were the entire content of the letter. Judging from the handwriting on these cards, except for five or six, the rest were filled in with four identical pencil handwritings, one of which wrote thirteen cards. The names of the senders on three cards were first written in English pinyin and then translated into Chinese characters. The handwriting on the cards is very scribbled, obviously filled in hastily. Therefore, the back of one card was even handed in without a single word written on it.

Looking more closely, the names of eight senders on these cards cannot be found at all in the prisoner information provided by the U.S. side on December 18th. If these people exist, why didn't the U.S. side include their names in the prisoner list handed over to us? In addition, there are five senders whose numbers are the same as those in the prisoner information provided by the U.S. side, but the names do not match. May I ask, which is real and which is fake, Mr. Ghostwriter? The addresses of many recipients are vague. Eleven of them are sent to cities, but the cards not only lack house numbers, but even the street names are roughly the same, nothing more than "East Avenue," "West Avenue," "Cross Street," and the like. One card with the recipient's address as Beijing even has a street name that does not exist in Beijing at all: "Totalitarian Street." As for the recipients, there are fabricated names such as "Old Man Zhao," "Zhang Laosan," and even "Pan Jinlian" from the Water Margin.

Let the people of the world see! These are the so-called "letters home" from captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army handed over by the United Nations forces. This is the frivolous attitude of those generals who keep saying "humanitarianism" and "thinking only of the welfare of the prisoners and the grief of their families." Everyone with a clear understanding can know what kind of treatment the captured personnel of the Korean-Chinese side are receiving in the U.S. prisoner of war camps after seeing these "letters home."

### 新华社记者报道  美方竟以敷衍填写的表格冒充我被俘人员的“家信”

    美方竟以敷衍填写的表格冒充我被俘人员的“家信”
    【新华社二日讯】本社特派记者三十一日自开城报道：在这一九五一年的最后一天，人们仍旧不能从板门店听到朝鲜停战谈判达成协议的消息。这个历时一百七十五天的谈判，由于美方在谈判的路上一再设置障碍，至今未能达成协议。
    朝中方面时刻为万千战俘和他们的家属设想，在圣诞节后的一天，就曾将美、英等国战俘亲笔书写的八百零三封家书交给美方代表李比，希望他迅速转送给战俘们的家属，好给他们带去节日的欢乐。在一九五一年除夕，朝中方面又将美、英等国战俘的九百八十封家信交给美方。如果这些信件不被阻难而能迅速转给收信者，那么，在一九五二年的新年，美、英俘虏们的一部分家属，将会愉快地接到这些信件。
    到三十一日为止，朝中方面只收到美方代表转来的朝中被俘人员的少数“家信”。在十二月二十六日收到的一批“家信”中，仅有四十三封是寄到中国去的。这些信件是用印好的三十二开卡片写的，卡片正面是备发信人填写的姓名、籍贯、俘虏编号、发信地点以及收信人的姓名、住址和国籍等栏，反面是供写信的空白。翻阅这些卡片后得到的印象是：这些卡片与其说是信件，倒不如说是敷衍填写的表格。大家知道：中国人是不过圣诞节的，但是美国将军却把他们自己的习惯强加于中国人民志愿军的被俘人员，在四十三张卡片中，就有三十九张上写了“庆祝圣诞我很好”七个大字，而这七个字也就是信的全部内容。从这些卡片的字迹来看，除了五、六张以外，其余都是四种相同的铅笔字迹所填写的，其中有一种字迹就代写了十三张。有三张卡片上的发信人的名字，竟是先用英文拚音写后再译成汉字的。卡片上的字迹很潦草，显然是仓卒填写的，因此，有一张卡片反面，甚至根本没有写一个字就交来了。
    再仔细看一下，这些卡片中有八个发信人的姓名在美方十二月十八日交来的俘虏资料中是根本找不到的，如果有这些人，美方为什么不把他们的名字编在交给我方的俘虏名单中呢？另外又有五个发信人和美方交来的俘虏资料中的编号相同，但姓名却不符，请问代笔先生到底那个是真，那个是假？许多收信人的地址含糊不清，其中有十一张是寄到城市里去的，但卡片上不仅没有门牌号数，就是街名也大致相同，不外是什么“东大街”、“西大街”、“十字街”之类。有一张收信人住址为北京的卡片上，还出现了一个北京根本没有的街名：“极权街”。至于收信人，有什么“赵老汉”、“张老三”，以至还有水浒传上的“潘金莲”等等捏造的人名。
    请全世界人民看看吧！这就是联合国军方面所交来的所谓中国人民志愿军被俘人员的“家信”，这就是那些口口声声说什么“人道主义”，说什么“一心只想到俘虏的福利和他们家庭的哀痛”的将军们的儿戏态度。每个明理的人看了这些“家信”，就可以知道在美方俘虏营中的朝中被俘人员是在受着什么待遇。
