New Theories in the Science of Cosmic Development
Translated by Li He

In April of this year, the Soviet scientific community held a "Conference on the Theory of Evolution of the Solar System." At the conference, Soviet astronomer Academician O. Yu. Schmidt gave a report entitled "The Problem of the Origin of the Earth and Planets." Schmidt and a group of Soviet scientists have been studying this issue for many years. In his report, he refuted the old, anti-scientific hypotheses about the origin of the universe and put forward a new theory. The Soviet scientific community attached great importance to this conference. The fourth volume of "Philosophical Problems" in 1951 published a summary of Academician Schmidt's report. On December 11, 1951, the Pravda published Professor Kukarkin's concise article introducing the conference and Schmidt's arguments. ——Translator's Note

The conference on the problems of the theory of cosmic evolution (the science that studies the origin and development of celestial bodies) was a major event in the Soviet natural science community this year.

The focus of the conference was to explain the new meteoritic theory of the origin of the Earth and planets, which has been laid and created by Academician O. Yu. Schmidt and other Soviet scientists in recent years. This theory is based on a scientific and materialist understanding of natural phenomena.

As everyone knows, until recently, the cosmic origin hypothesis of the British physicist and idealist Jeans was widely circulated in astronomy. This hypothesis has been popular in all astronomy textbooks and popular books until the early 1940s.

According to this hypothesis, the development of the solar system was the result of the accidental approach of the sun to a celestial body passing by: part of the sun's material was drawn away from the sun by the gravity of the passing star, dispersed into several parts, and thus formed the planets—the sun's satellites.

Calculations have shown that the probability of such an approach of celestial bodies is negligible, and the planetary system formed is a completely exceptional, non-repeatable accidental event. However, it was precisely the accidental nature of the universe's creation, as Jeans said, that determined the prevalence of his hypothesis in capitalist countries; because on this basis, the seemingly scientific explanation of the origin of the earth is close to the so-called religious legends of opening up the universe. The credit for thoroughly refuting Jeans's hypothesis belongs to the Soviet scientific community. Soviet astronomer N. N. Parisky used precise mathematical calculations to prove that most of the objects drawn away by gravity should either fall back into the sun or disappear into space with the star flying past the sun.

The hypotheses of British physicists Milne and Haldane were equally idealistic and reactionary. These hypotheses developed an absurd idea that the huge “primitive atom” of light energy was transformed into the entity of the entire solar system. Milne even mentioned that the universe would be “opened up” in this way at a certain period.

In contrast to the unsuccessful and idealistic hypotheses of cosmic origin, Soviet natural science has put forward a successful, materialistic, and progressive theory of cosmic evolution.

Our scientists inherited the advanced scientific traditions of Russia, and in the years of Soviet power, they were able to deeply solve many partial and general problems of the origin and development of celestial bodies and the earth.

As early as the 1920s, V. G. Fesenkov began his systematic research in cosmic evolution. He examined many possible ways to solve the problem of the origin of the earth, planets, stars, and asteroids in the solar system. He noted that cosmic evolution must be in contact with geophysics (the science that studies the celestial body that is easiest to study—the earth).

In the past twenty years, the Soviet Union has greatly developed astrophysics (a branch of astronomy that studies the nature of celestial bodies) and stellar astronomy (a branch of astronomy that studies the structure and mechanics of galaxies). The achievements of these branches of astronomy, together with the achievements of physics, have made it possible to propose and implement many valuable researches in the cosmic evolution of stars and galaxies.

Soviet astronomer V. A. Ambartsumian demonstrated a major principle, namely that the process of star formation is still continuing. Ambartsumian's conclusions, confirmed by many studies by other Soviet scientists, are of great significance in the struggle against idealistic views in cosmic evolution, which attempt to argue that the universe was created exactly two hundred billion years ago, no more, no less. The research of many other Soviet astronomers is expected to solve in detail the complex problem of the development of stars and the relationship between various stars.

However, some Soviet researchers, regardless of these achievements in astronomy, believed that the problem of the origin of the earth was still impossible to solve at the level of modern scientific knowledge.

The work of Academician Schmidt and a group of scientists on the origin and development of the Earth and planets has dealt a serious blow to this erroneous view since 1943. These works led to the creation of a new, well-argued, materialist cosmic evolution theory.

The scientist's starting point is that planets are formed by the condensation of meteoritic objects in a state of dust.

These cloud-like scattered objects can be observed in large quantities in the sky, especially in the bright Milky Way. The Milky Way is the main cluster of a large galaxy (the Milky Way Galaxy), and our sun is also within this galaxy. These scattered objects—"cosmic dust"—gather into large clumps, acting as "building materials" from which planets are produced. According to Schmidt's view, planets are formed by the union of a large number of small molecules, which revolve independently around the sun before the union.

Schmidt then accurately demonstrated how those molecules orbiting the sun are regularly distributed in a plane, and how the planets being produced acquire their own axis of rotation and movement around the sun. The special positions of the small Earth-like planets (referring to the Earth, Mars, etc.) near the sun and the giant planets far from the sun are also explained. The planets developed in this way: most of the molecules near the sun merged into the sun, and the others were driven away by the strong pressure of light, so there were no conditions for the formation of large planets near the sun. On the contrary, objects accumulated far from the sun, leading to the formation of large planets. Molecules near the sun were heated by the sun's heat, causing these flying objects to evaporate. Therefore, the Earth-like planets near the sun only retained non-fusible objects—stony and iron objects, while the distant planets—Jupiter, Saturn, and other planets—preserved a large amount of hydrogen, as well as compounds of hydrogen and carbon, and hydrogen and nitrogen.

The new theory makes scientists studying cosmic evolution pay special attention to the celestial bodies famous for their meteorites. The hundreds of meteorites of different sizes that fall to Earth every year are certainly not the molecules of the objects that orbit the sun and form planets themselves. Meteorites, like planets, are the product of the long-term development of primitive molecules, and the result of countless conflicts and transformations of primitive molecules. However, the fall of meteorites to the Earth is related to a series of cosmic processes that are the basis for the origin and development of planets.

The meteorite theory explains the orbital states of the planets orbiting the sun, the prograde and retrograde motion of their satellites, the rotation of the planets, and other laws. This is the first time in cosmic evolution that such a perfect explanation of observed facts has been achieved with a unified perspective.

Contrary to the concept that has dominated astronomy for nearly two hundred years—that celestial bodies were initially in a state of hot gas and hot liquid—the new theory concludes that the Earth and other planets were initially cold.

This conclusion provides a new basis for the study of the Earth's composition, the forces acting within the Earth, and the Earth's history.

The theory of geology—the science that studies the Earth's composition—still starts from the outdated cosmic evolution concept that the Earth was in a hot liquid state in the past. On this basis, the theory of volcanoes was formed, the theory of mountain formation was developed, and it was believed that volcanic eruptions more or less proved the molten state of the Earth's interior, and that the formation of mountains was the result of the shrinking of the Earth's crust as it gradually cooled and solidified.

The meteorite theory calls for abandoning these outdated concepts.

When the Earth developed, the initially cold planet gradually heated up. The source of geothermal heat is the process of radioactive separation within the Earth. Detailed and meticulous calculations make it possible to determine the varying temperatures of the Earth now and in the past. According to the new theory, the Earth's cooling only began after the stored radioactivity was greatly reduced, which took many hundreds of millions of years. Therefore, the cooling of the Earth's crust is not the cause of mountain formation, but the Earth's heating due to radioactive separation is the source of power necessary for the uplift of mountains on the ground.

The new theory connects the "pre-geological stage" and the "geological stage" of the Earth's development. Geologists are now further studying the fault phenomena encountered by objects inside the Earth as a result of the Earth's development. The laws of these faults are extremely important for the theory of earthquakes.

The emergence of Schmidt's theory of cosmic evolution has attracted the attention of many Soviet scientists to the problem of the origin of the universe. The theory that planets are formed by the condensation of cosmic dust and meteoritic objects has been thoroughly demonstrated. There are now convincing arguments that the movement of solid molecules in a cloud of objects dispersed within a certain density inevitably leads to the formation of condensation, and these molecules eventually fuse into planets due to numerous collisions. There are also other works that confirm the correctness and success of the new direction in cosmic evolution.

The achievements of Soviet cosmic evolution in recent years have marked a new stage in the study of the origin and development of celestial bodies. This stage marks the transition from contradictory hypotheses to scientifically demonstrated cosmic evolution.

The characteristics of Soviet cosmic evolution are: thorough materialism, a deep belief in the materiality of the world, and a deep belief in the knowability of all laws of material development.

Another equally important characteristic of Soviet cosmic evolution is its guidance for practical requirements—attention to tasks such as determining the Earth's mineral deposits and predicting earthquakes. Only under the socialist system, where science follows Comrade Stalin's instructions and keenly listens to the voices of experience and practice, is this in-depth integration of theoretical tasks and practical tasks possible.

When our country (referring to the Soviet Union) studies the problem of cosmic evolution, it does not start with only isolated astronomers or physicists participating, as is common in capitalist countries; instead, entire groups of scientists participate, including mathematicians, geologists, geophysicists, geochemists, and representatives from other scientific fields. In this way, the solution to the problem of cosmic evolution extends along a broad scientific front in the Soviet Union.

Soviet cosmic evolution has developed under good conditions of free debate and free criticism. The conference on cosmic evolution held this year summarized the work of Soviet scientists in the cosmic evolution of planets. The conference approved Schmidt's work on explaining the formation of planets and their satellites from dusty objects. At the same time, the conference pointed out a series of shortcomings and deficiencies in Schmidt's work that should be eliminated in the future.

The conference determined the direction of future research work on cosmic evolution. There is no doubt that materialistic Soviet science, relying on the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and guided by the practical requirements of communist construction, will solve many of the tasks put forward in cosmic evolution in the near future. Bourgeois natural science as a whole cannot solve, and cannot even propose, these tasks. The scientific center for the origin of celestial bodies and the development of the ever-existing and changing universe has now shifted to our country.

    宇宙发展科学中的新理论
    李何译
    今年四月间，苏联科学界举行了“太阳系宇宙进化论的会议”。会上苏联天文学家奥·尤·斯米特院士作了“地球和行星起源问题”的报告。斯米特和一批苏联科学家研究这个问题已经多年。他在报告中驳斥了关于宇宙起源的旧的反科学的假说，提出了新的理论。苏联科学界非常重视这次会议。“哲学问题”一九五一年第四卷曾经登载了斯米特院士报告的摘要。一九五一年十二月十一日真理报发表了库卡金教授这篇简明介绍这次会议和斯米特论点的文章。  ——译者注
    宇宙进化论（研究天体起源和发展的科学）问题的会议，是今年苏联自然科学界的一件大事。
    会议注意的中心，是说明地球和行星之起源的新的陨石论，它是由奥·尤·斯契米特院士及其他苏联科学家近年来奠定和创立的。这个理论以对自然界现象的科学的唯物的理解为基础。
    大家知道，直到最近以前，天文学方面曾经广泛流传英国物理学家唯心论者詹斯的宇宙起源假说，这个假说在一切天文学的教科书和通俗书籍中一直流行到四十年代初期。
    按照这个假说，太阳系底发展，是太阳与从旁飞过的星体偶然接近的结果：太阳的一部分物质被从旁飞过的星底引力吸离太阳，分散成几个部分，遂形成了行星——太阳的卫星。
    计算说明了：星体底这种接近的盖然性是微不足道的，由此形成的行星系统完全是例外的，不会重复的偶然性事件。然而，正是詹斯所说的宇宙产生的偶然性，决定了他的假说能在资本主义各国盛行；因为在这个基础上，关于地球起源的貌似科学的解释，是和所谓开辟宇宙的宗教传说相接近的。彻底驳倒詹斯的假说的功劳，属于苏联科学界。苏联天文学家纳·纳·巴里斯基以精确的数学计算证明：大部分被引力吸开的物体，应当是回落到太阳去，或者随着从太阳旁边飞过的星体在空间消逝。
    英国物理学家米兰和何尔登的假说是同样唯心的和反动的，这些假说发展着一种荒唐的观念，即光能底巨大“原始原子”转变为整个太阳系的实体。米兰甚至说到了在一定时期将用这种方法“开辟宇宙”。
    苏联自然科学与无成就的、唯心的宇宙起源假说相反，提出了有成就的、唯物的、进步的宇宙进化论。
    我们的科学家继承了俄罗斯先进的科学传统，在苏维埃政权年代，能够深刻地解决了天体与地球底起源与发展的许多局部的和总的问题。
    远在二十年代，维·格·费森科夫就开始了他在宇宙进化论方面的有系统的研究。他审视了许多可能解决太阳系中地球、行星、星体、小星的起源的问题的途径。他注意到，必须使宇宙进化论接触地球物理学（研究最便于研究的天体——地球——的科学）。
    苏联在最近二十年间大大发展了天体物理学（天文学分科，研究天体本性）和星体天文学（天文学分科，研究星系底构造和力学）。这些天文学分科的成就，连同物理学的成就，使得在星体和星系底宇宙进化论方面能够提出和实现许多宝贵的研究。
    苏联天文学家维·阿·阿姆巴楚米扬论证了一个主要的原理，即星体底形成过程现在还在继续。阿姆巴楚米扬的结论，由其他苏联科学家的许多研究所证实，它在向宇宙进化论中的唯心见解作斗争上，具有巨大的意义，这类见解企图论证宇宙产生在不多不少恰好二十万万年以前。苏联许多其他天文学家底研究，可望详细地解决关于星体底发展和各种星体之间的联系的复杂问题。
    然而，有些苏联研究者曾不顾天文学方面的这些成就，认为在现代科学知识水平上地球起源问题还不可能解决。
    斯契米特院士和一批科学家关于地球和行星底起源与发展问题的工作，从一九四三年起就给这种错误的观点以严重的打击。这些工作引到了新的、有深刻论据的、唯物的宇宙进化论的创立。
    这位科学家的出发点是：行星是由处在灰尘状态的陨石物体凝结而形成的。
    这些云层般散布的物体，在天空中可以大量观测到，特别是在光亮的银河一带。银河是一个大星系（银河系）底主要星团，我们的太阳也在这星系之内。这些散布的物体——“宇宙尘”，集成大团，起着“建筑材料”的作用，从这些“建筑材料”产生行星。按照斯契米特的见解，行星是由大量小分子联合而成，这些小分子在联合之前是独立地环绕太阳运转的。
    斯契米特随后精确地论证了，那些环绕太阳的分子怎样有规律地分配在一个平面内，以及那些正在产生中的行星怎样取得环绕自己轴心和环绕太阳的运动。关于接近太阳的不大的地球类行星（指地球、火星等——译者）和远离太阳的巨大行星之特殊的位置，也得到了解释。行星是这样发展的：接近太阳的分子大多数合并到太阳去，另外的被强烈的光底压力赶掉，所以在太阳附近没有造成产生大行星的条件。相反的，远离太阳的地方却累积了物体，导致了大行星底形成。处在太阳附近的分子，由于太阳热度而炽热，遂使这些飞来物体蒸发。因此，接近太阳的地球类行星只保留了难熔化的物体——石质的和铁质的物体，这时远处的行星——木星、土星及其他行星却保存大量氢，以及氢和碳，氢和氮的化合物。
    新理论使研究宇宙进化论的科学家们特别注意那批以陨石出名的天体。每年落到地球上的几百个体积不同的陨石，当然并不就是环绕太阳、形成行星的物体底分子本身。陨石，如同行星，是原始分子长期发展的产物，是原始分子无数冲突和转变的结果。但是陨石落到地球上，这关系着作为行星起源和发展基础的一系列宇宙过程。
    陨石论解释了诸行星环绕太阳运转的轨道状态，它们的卫星的顺行和逆行，行星的自转及其他规律。以统一的观点达到这样完善地解释所观测的事实，在宇宙进化论方面这还是第一次。
    新理论与在天文学中居统治地位近两百年的观念——天体起初处在炽热气体状态和炎热液体状态——相反，得出结论说，地球及其他行星起初是冷的。
    这个结论为地球的构成、地球内起作用的力量和地球历程问题的研究，提供了崭新的基础。
    研究地球构成的科学——地质学——的理论，至今还是由地球过去是处在炎热液体状态的陈旧的宇宙进化论观念出发。在这个基础上形成了火山的理论，发展了山岭构成的学说，认为火山的喷火多多少少证明地球内部的熔化状态，而山岭的构成是由于逐渐变冷和凝固的地球外壳缩皱的结果。
    陨石论号召抛弃这些陈旧的观念。
    地球发展时，起初冷的行星逐渐转热。地热的来源是地球内部进行的放射性分离的过程。详细和缜密的计算，使地球现在和过去高低不等的温度得以确定。按照新理论，地球之变冷，只是在储蓄的放射现象大大减少之后才开始，这经过许多个十万万年。所以，地球外壳底变冷不是山岭构成的原因，而地球由于放射性分离而变热才是地面上隆起山岭所必需的力量的源泉。
    新理论把地球发展底“地质前阶段”和“地质阶段”联接起来。地质学家现在进而研究由于地球发展的结果地球内部物体所遭遇的断层现象。这些断层的规律对于地震理论极为重要。
    斯契米特宇宙进化论的出现，吸引了苏联许多科学家对宇宙起源问题的注意。由于宇宙尘和陨石物体之凝结而形成行星的理论已经得到了详细的论证。现在已经有了令人信服的论据，说明在一定密度内散布的物体的云层中坚固分子底运动，不可避免地要引向凝结之形成，这些分子由于无数次冲突终归融合成行星。另外还有一些工作，也证实了宇宙进化论中新的方向之正确和有成就。
    苏联宇宙进化论近年来达到的成就，划出研究天体起源和发展问题的新阶段。这个阶段标志着从矛盾的假说到经过科学论证的宇宙进化论的转变。
    苏联宇宙进化论的特色是：彻底的唯物论，令人深信世界底物质性，深信一切物质发展规律底可知性。
    苏联宇宙进化论底另外一个同等重要的特点，是它对于实践要求的指导——注意如像确定地球矿藏，预报地震等类的任务。只有在社会主义制度的条件下，科学遵循着斯大林同志的指示，锐敏地倾听着经验、实践底声音，这种理论任务和实践任务底深入结合才成为可能。
    我国（指苏联——译者）在研究宇宙进化论问题时，一开始就不像在资本主义国家里所常见的，只有孤零的天文学家或物理学家参加；而是有整批的科学家参加的，数学家、地质学家、地球物理学家、地球化学家及其他科学领域的代表都参加研究。这样，宇宙进化论问题的解决在苏联伸展着一条广阔的科学阵线。
    苏联宇宙进化论是在自由争论和自由批评的良好条件下发展起来的。今年举行的宇宙进化论问题的会议，总结了苏联科学家在行星的宇宙进化论方面的工作。会议批准了斯契米特解释行星及其卫星由灰尘状物体形成的工作。同时会议指出斯契米特工作中一系列今后应当消除的缺陷和缺点。
    会议决定了此后宇宙进化论的研究工作的道路。不用怀疑，唯物主义的苏维埃科学，依靠着马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的学说，指导着共产主义建设的实践要求，将在最近期间解决宇宙进化论方面所提出的许多任务。资产阶级自然科学整个说来不仅无法解决，而且无法提出这些任务。关于天体之起源，关于永远存在着和变化着的宇宙之发展，这个科学中心现在移到我国了。
