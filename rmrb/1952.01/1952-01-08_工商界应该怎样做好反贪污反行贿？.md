How Should Industry and Commerce Combat Corruption and Bribery?
Fu Huating, Director of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce

Since the government called for the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, all sectors in Beijing have enthusiastically started this movement. Especially after the Third Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference at the end of last year, people from all walks of life, in response to Mayor Peng Zhen's call, have begun to confess and expose wrongdoings. In such a vigorous movement and intense struggle, we firmly believe that corruption can be eliminated, and waste can be gradually reduced and eradicated.

At the Representative Conference, Mayor Peng pointed out that the main reasons for corruption and waste are the remaining toxins of the old society, the failure to eliminate corruption and hedonism, which have infected weak-willed cadres within the government; secondly, the inducement of bribery by illegal merchants, leading to illegal acts; and further, the failure to mobilize the masses to expose wrongdoings. These are objective reasons. Subjectively, it is due to low political awareness and insufficient vigilance. However, the People's Government cannot turn a blind eye to such corruption and waste, so it has adopted resolute measures to eliminate them. If corruption and waste are not resolutely opposed, some cadres will be infected and degenerate.

Can corruption and waste be overcome? Mayor Peng said: We have the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, battle-hardened revolutionary cadres as the backbone, and the broad masses as the foundation, as well as the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, so it is entirely possible to overcome them. Only in this way can we change customs and educate the masses. We adopt a policy that combines leniency and punishment. Mayor Peng also pointed out that it is necessary to combine leadership with the masses, mobilize the broad masses, distinguish between advantages and disadvantages, distinguish between right and wrong, everyone should examine, attack from above and below, attack from inside and outside, and conduct a comprehensive exposure to eliminate corruption. Those who confess themselves can be treated leniently. Mayor Peng instructed us that under the People's Government, even a little bit of corruption and waste is absolutely not allowed and must be resolutely eliminated! The government can be lenient to those who sincerely repent and confess their mistakes. For example, if industry and commerce have colluded with tax officials through bribery to evade taxes in the past, as long as they confess, they only need to pay the evaded taxes for 1951, and the evaded taxes before that will not be repaid, nor will they be fined. In the past, if collusion and bribery occurred in national infrastructure construction, resulting in substandard work and materials and causing losses to the state, as long as they confess, they only need to compensate for the 1951 project, and the previous ones will not be pursued. However, if they do not confess and are exposed by others, or are discovered from other sources, they will be penalized doubly. Everyone should think about how lenient the government is to those who sincerely repent, confess and admit their mistakes! If they do not confess themselves but are exposed by others, they will be dealt with according to the law, with both repayment and fines, tracing back to the time of liberation. Therefore, everyone can distinguish between right and wrong, distinguish between advantages and disadvantages, and choose for themselves. Moreover, the People's Government has already grasped a lot of information about corruption, and the number of exposures from all sides is increasing day by day. In this climax of comprehensive exposure, can you escape by luck? Can you not be exposed if you don't confess? Definitely not, that is a fantasy. Only by being honest, confessing sincerely, and repenting earnestly is there a path to self-renewal. At the same time, all of us in industry and commerce should also mobilize, in order to maintain the glory of our collective, bravely expose and comprehensively reveal corruption and bribery. Only by resolutely eliminating corruption and bribery can we pave the way for the development of legitimate industry and commerce.

Since we in industry and commerce recognize the great significance of the relentless struggle against corruption, bribery and all bad habits and malpractices, after the establishment of the Industry and Commerce Thrift Branch on December 25th last year and the convening of a mobilization meeting of 1,458 responsible representatives of affiliated units, various units have universally taken action. As of December 30th, 3,125 meetings of various types and sizes have been held, with the participation of 66,750 people. The Federation has received a large number of confession and exposure materials. For example, Li Jifu, Director of the Radio Industry Committee, took the lead in confessing personal problems during the mobilization, which enlightened the industry's attention to this movement. In addition to general mobilization, individual assistance is also provided. As of December 30th, 58 of the 120-plus households in the industry have submitted written confession and exposure materials to the Federation (those submitted to other units are excluded). The construction, new medicine, and auto parts industries have all undergone repeated publicity mobilization and individual mobilization and enlightenment. The directors and committee members personally presided over various meetings, promptly clearing up members' ideological concerns, and improving members' understanding of this movement. As of January 1st, of the 270-plus member households in the construction industry, 107 have confessed and exposed; of the 250-plus member households in the new medicine industry, 54 have confessed or exposed; and of the 69 member households in the auto parts industry, 35 have confessed and exposed.

The development of this movement has also received the support of the broad masses. They believe that this kind of movement demonstrates the correctness of the government's policies and fully meets the requirements of legitimate industry and commerce. For example, Jia Buchi from the electrical materials industry said: "With this, it is easier to do business if you are honest." Some committee members said: "In business, both buyers and sellers are clear, the cadres are also good, and business is also good!" Li Changheng of Sanheyuan in the vehicle industry said: "Today, the government has come up with a method, I don't know how many brilliant people have come up with ideas, this method is really good!" A committee member in the electrical materials industry said: "Where can people who make mistakes find such an opportunity? It's so good to say whatever you want!"

However, at present, some people in various industries still have ideological concerns, fearing punishment after confession. The understanding of this movement by the heads, committee members, and staff of some units is still insufficient, and the work is still somewhat formalistic. It is still necessary to continue to strengthen supervision, inspection and assistance, repeatedly and deeply publicize, clear up concerns, and promote everyone to consciously confess and boldly expose. In order to prevent the phenomenon of "a sigh of relief" from occurring in this movement, combined with the communication of the spirit of the representatives conference, it has been communicated to various lines and industries since December 31st of last year, and it is necessary to make it known to every household. Furthermore, in accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference on launching the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement with great fanfare, we must set off a climax in this movement.

Friends in industry and commerce: We have made great progress in the past two years under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. We must do our best to do well in anything that is beneficial to the country and the people. Conversely, we must abolish anything that is harmful to the country and the people. Corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are the enemies of expanding production and practicing economy. We must all mobilize together and cooperate with the government to resolutely eliminate them. The anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in industry and commerce is the main key to eliminating corruption and waste, which is good for the country and the people, and especially good for legitimate industry and commerce. Those who have committed crimes in the past but confess have also received lenient treatment. Therefore, undoubtedly, in order to maintain the glory of our industry and commerce as a whole, I hope that everyone will seize the time and act quickly! Don't miss the opportunity and be subject to legal punishment; honestly and thoroughly confess the facts of bribery without reservation. Don't confess small things and keep big things, which is equivalent to not confessing. Don't have concerns or try to conceal, which is absolutely impossible. It is better to wake up quickly! We in industry and commerce have already laid the foundation for temporary study and explaining history. We must honestly and sincerely respond to the government's call; we must resolutely and thoroughly carry out the anti-corruption and anti-bribery work.

Finally, I would like to introduce another example for our friends in industry and commerce to use as a reference. That is: all the staff of the Beijing Railway Branch held a 3,000-plus-person anti-corruption struggle meeting on the morning of the 4th. At this struggle meeting, the handling of nine major corruption and smuggling criminals was announced. Among these nine people, six were truly repentant, thoroughly confessed, and made meritorious service by exposing others, and thus received lenient treatment and were exempted from legal and administrative punishment. The other three refused to confess and sabotaged the movement. At that time, representatives of the Municipal People's Court announced the arrest of these three people, who would be punished more severely. We see that these nine people are all major corruption and smuggling criminals, but they have received two different conclusions, two different treatments, and the difference is very large. Why is this? Isn't it just the difference between confessing and not confessing, being honest and not being honest? I believe that corrupt and bribe-taking industrialists and merchants will take these six confessors as examples, and will not be willing to imitate those three dishonest people who do not confess and suffer the taste of arrest and severe punishment.

Friends in industry and commerce throughout the city: I sincerely hope that the heads, group leaders, committee members, and staff of various units of the Federation of Industry and Commerce will give play to the spirit of service, based on the attitude of treating illnesses and saving people, repeatedly publicize, discuss, and deliberate in various grassroots groups, explain the problems, eliminate concerns, and help each household consciously confess and vigorously expose, and strive to thoroughly eliminate corruption, bribery and all bad habits and malpractices!

    工商界应该怎样做好反贪污反行贿？
    北京市工商业联合会主任  傅华亭
    自从政府号召展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动以来，全北京市各方面已经热烈地开展这个运动了。特别是经过了去年年底第三届第三次各界人民代表会议以后，各界人民为着响应彭真市长的号召，已经开始进行坦白检举。在这样轰轰烈烈的运动和最激烈的斗争中，我们坚决地相信贪污的现象是一定可以消灭的，浪费的现象是可以逐步减少和肃清的。
    在代表会议上，彭市长指出：造成贪污浪费现象的主要原因，是旧社会残留下来的毒素还存在，腐化享乐的现象还未肃清，传染到政府内部意志薄弱的干部；其次，是不法商人的引诱行贿，作出犯法的事情；更由于没有发动人民群众起来检举。这是客观的原因。主观上是由于政治觉悟低、警惕不够。但是，人民政府对这种贪污浪费现象，不能熟视无睹地放任下去，所以采取坚决消灭的办法。如果不坚决反对贪污浪费现象，一些干部就会受到传染而变质。
    能不能克服贪污浪费现象呢？彭市长说：我们有毛主席和中国共产党的领导，有久经锻炼的革命干部作骨干，有广大人民作基础，还有批评和自我批评的武器，完全是可以克服的。这样才可以移风易俗，教育群众。我们采取宽大和惩罚相结合的政策。彭市长又指出：要采取领导和群众相结合的办法，动员广大人民起来，分清利害，分清是非，大家检查，上下夹攻，内外夹攻，全面检举，来消灭贪污。自己坦白的可以从宽处理。我们工商界在这个运动里，重点是要做好反贪污反行贿的工作。我们首先是要把这项运动的重要意义广泛地、深入地告诉全体工商业者，让大家一齐来坦白和检举，把过去损害国家人民利益、勾结引诱政府干部的行贿事实，包括一切陋习“回扣”，全部地揭发干净。彭市长指示我们，对贪污浪费现象，在人民政府之下，连一点点都是绝对不能允许的，是要坚决的消灭它！对自己愿意坦白的人，政府可以宽大处理。譬如说，过去工商界勾结引诱过税务人员行贿而漏税的，只要坦白承认，只补一九五一年的漏税，以前的漏税不再补，也不罚。过去对国家基本建设进行过勾结行贿、发生过偷工减料行为，使国家蒙受到损失的工程，只要坦白，也只补偿一九五一年的工程，以前的不再追究。可是，如果不坦白，被别人检举了，或者从别的方面被察觉了，那就要加倍受罚。大家想想，政府对我们真诚悔改坦白认错的人采取多么宽大的政策！如果不自己坦白，被别人检举出来的，那么是依法办理，又补又罚，追究到自解放时起。所以，何舍何从，就可以分清是非，分清利害，自己选择了。何况现在人民政府已经掌握了许多贪污的材料，各方面检举的也一天一天地多了。在这种全面检举高潮中，你能够侥幸逃避么？你能够不坦白就不被检举出来么？肯定的说，那是幻想。只有忠诚老实坦白，认真悔改，才是自新之路。同时，我们全体工商业者也应该动员起来，为着保持我们整体的光荣，勇敢地检举、全面地揭发贪污行贿。只有坚决地肃清贪污行贿现象，才能给正当工商业者的发展铺平道路。
    我们工商界既认识到向贪污行贿行为和一切恶习陋规作无情斗争的伟大意义，所以自从去年十二月二十五日成立了工商界节约分会、召集了所属各单位负责代表一千四百五十八人的动员大会以后，各单位已经普遍地行动起来了。至十二月三十日为止，已经召开了各种不同类型大小会议三千一百二十五次，参加人数六万六千七百五十名。本会已收到大量的坦白检举材料。如无线电业主任委员李纪甫在动员时候首先带头坦白了个人的问题，启发了同业对这运动的重视。除了普遍的动员外，并进行个别帮助。至十二月三十日止，全业一百二十多户已有五十八户向本会送交书面坦白检举材料（送到其他单位的在外）。营造、新药、汽车材料等业都经过了反复的宣传动员、个别动员启发，主任委员和委员亲自主持各项会议，及时打通会员思想顾虑，提高了会员对这运动的认识。至一月一日止，营造业二百七十多户会员中，已坦白检举的有一百零七家；新药业二百五十多户会员中，已有五十四户坦白或检举；汽车材料业六十九户会员中，已有三十五户坦白和检举。
    这个运动的展开，也得到了广大群众的支持。他们认为这种运动说明政府政策的正确，完全符合正当工商业者的要求。如电料业贾步墀说：“这样一来，守本分的买卖容易做了。”有的委员说：“在业务上买卖双方全利落了，干部也好了，买卖也好啦！”车具业会员三和源的李昌恒说：“今天政府想出一个办法，不知道有多少高明人出主意，这个办法真好！”电料业委员说：“犯错误的人那里去找这种机会呢？有什么便说什么多好！”
    但是目前各业中还有些人思想上有顾虑，怕坦白后受处罚。部分单位的负责人、委员、职员对这个运动的认识还不够，工作还有些形式主义，仍旧要继续加强督促、检查和帮助，反复深入地宣传，打通顾虑，促进大家自觉地坦白，大胆地检举。为了防止这一运动发生“松一口气”的现象，结合各界代表会议的传达，已自去年十二月三十一日起，分行分业地传达下去，一定要作到家喻户晓，更进一步地遵照市各界人民代表会议关于大张旗鼓开展反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动的决议的精神，掀起这一运动的高潮。
    各位工商界朋友们：我们过去两年来在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，有了很大的进步。凡是对国家人民有益的事情，我们一定努力去作好。相反的，对国家人民有害的事情，我们一定要取消。贪污浪费官僚主义是开展增产节约的敌人，我们要一齐动员起来，配合政府坚决来把它肃清。工商界反贪污、反行贿运动，就是肃清贪污浪费的主要关键，对国家对人民都有好处，特别对正当工商业者更有好处。过去犯法而坦白的人，又获得了宽大的待遇。所以，无疑地，为着保持我们工商界整体的光荣，希望大家掌握时间，快些行动起来罢！不要错过机会，受到法律上的处分；老老实实地把行贿事实毫不保留地彻底坦白出来。不要坦白小的、保留大的，那就等于不坦白。也不要存在顾虑，希图隐瞒，那是绝对走不通的。还是赶快地自觉起来吧！我们工商界已经有了临时学习交代历史的基础，我们要忠诚老实地响应政府的号召；我们一定要坚决把反贪污、反行贿工作做彻底。
    最后，我再介绍一个实例，供给我们工商界朋友们作个参考。就是：北京铁路分局全体职工在四日上午举行了一个三千多人的反贪污斗争大会。在这个斗争大会中，宣布对九个案情较大的贪污走私分子的处理。这九个人里有六个人是真心悔改、彻底坦白并检举立功的，因而得到了从宽的处理，免除了法律和行政处分。另外三个人是拒不坦白并破坏运动的，当时由市人民法院代表宣布把这三个人逮捕，并将加重惩办。我们看这九个人同是案情较大的贪污走私分子，却得到两个不同的结论，两种不同的处理，而且相差得很远，这是为什么呢？还不就是坦白和不坦白、忠诚老实和不忠诚老实的分别吗？我相信贪污行贿的工商业者们会以这坦白的六个人为榜样，而不至于甘愿效法那三个不坦白的不老实的人去尝受逮捕重办的滋味。
    全市工商界朋友们：我深切地希望工商业联合会各单位的负责人、组长、委员、工作人员，发挥服务的精神，本着治病救人的态度，在各基层小组内，反复地宣传、讨论、酝酿，说明问题，消除顾虑，帮助各户自觉坦白、大力检举，为彻底肃清贪污、行贿和一切恶习陋规而奋斗！
