    Learning from the Spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy, We Must Strive to Cultivate Talent for the Motherland

    Comrade Editor: Recently, we have often seen in newspapers the production increase and economy practice plans of the Volunteer Army comrades, and many touching stories of cherishing the property of the motherland. They save their own heating expenses, clothing, mosquito nets, and other necessities of life to respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy. Their noble patriotic spirit makes us even more admire and love them.

    The heroic Volunteer Army comrades, full of patriotism and internationalism, are fighting the enemy in the icy and snowy weather. Their lives are hard. How can we allow them to further reduce their living standards? When we are sitting in warm rooms, how can we allow them to not have heating on the cliffs of ice and snow at forty degrees below zero? How can we allow our "most beloved people" to not use mosquito nets in the dense forests and valleys?

    However, among many staff members and business circles in the country, there are still serious criminal acts of embezzlement, waste, bribery, tax evasion, and other theft of state property. The fruits of victory, bought with the blood of thousands of heroes, are arbitrarily stolen and squandered by these criminals. We must resolutely wage an irreconcilable struggle against these criminal acts and not allow them to continue to exist.

    We are a group of educators. The happiness of educators is also bought with the heroic battles of the Volunteer Army comrades. We guarantee to thoroughly transform our thinking, use the least amount of manpower and material resources to cultivate more talent needed by the motherland, in order to answer and thank our hero Volunteer Army.

    学习志愿军增产节约的精神我们要努力为祖国培养人材
    编辑同志：最近，我们时常从报纸上看到志愿军同志们的增产节约计划，和许多爱护祖国财产的可歌可泣的故事。他们节省自己的烤火费、服装、蚊帐等生活必需品来响应毛主席关于增产节约的号召。他们这种崇高的爱国主义精神，使我们更加崇敬和热爱他们。
    充满着爱国主义和国际主义精神的英勇的志愿军同志们，在冰天雪地里和敌人搏斗。他们的生活是艰苦的。我们怎能允许他们再降低自己的生活水平？当我们坐在暖室里的时候，怎能允许他们在零下四十度的冰天雪地的山崖上不烤火？怎能允许我们“最可爱的人”在茂林深谷里不用蚊帐？
    但是，在国内许多工作人员和工商界中，还存在着严重的贪污浪费、行贿、漏税等盗窃国家资财的犯罪行为，成千成万英雄们用鲜血换来的胜利果实，被这些罪犯任意盗窃和挥霍了；我们要坚决和这些犯罪行为进行不调和的斗争，不允许它继续存在。
    我们是一群教育工作者，教育工作者的幸福也是志愿军同志们的英勇战斗换来的。我们保证彻底改造自己的思想，用最少的人力、物力培养出更多的祖国所需要的人材，以此来回答和感谢我们志愿军的英雄们。　　天津南开大学物理系全体教员
