    Guanghua Textile Factory
    Self-Criticism for Neglecting Female Workers' Welfare
    Editor:
    In the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on December 27th, our factory worker Mao Zhuomin criticized us for not paying enough attention to the welfare of female workers. This criticism is correct. After our factory merged in November last year, the number of female workers increased, but there were only two female toilets in the factory. One large toilet had no roof and no lights; the water pipe in a toilet in the workshop was broken, and we did not repair it in time, causing it to be out of service for several days. After the workers and the trade union raised their opinions, we built a shed over the large toilet, installed lights, and added another female toilet on the north side of the factory building, which began to be used on the 18th of last month. Although these tasks have been completed one after another, we have not been strict in checking and supervising the work, and the solution to the toilet problem has been delayed. This is wrong. In order to examine the shortcomings in our work, we have launched a democratic, united, and progressive movement throughout the factory since the 24th of last month, calling on all employees to offer suggestions to the administration and the trade union in order to improve our work and improve production. Guanghua Textile Factory, Factory Director Feng Xin, Trade Union Chairman Huang Chengtian

    光华纺织厂
    对不重视女工福利的检讨
    编辑同志：上月二十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏内，刊载了我厂工人毛卓民对我们不重视女工福利的批评，这个批评是正确的。我厂在去年十一月并厂后，女工增多，而厂内只有两个女厕所。一个大的厕所没有顶棚，没装电灯；车间的一个厕所因自来水管坏了，我们也没有及时修理，致停用了几天。工人和工会提意见以后，我们把那个大厕所搭了棚，安上了灯，另外在厂房北面又添修女厕所一个，上月十八日开始使用。这些工作虽陆续做好，但我们对工作检查督促得不严，对厕所问题解决得迟缓，这是不对的。为了检查我们工作中的缺点，自上月二十四日起，我们在全厂展开了民主、团结、进步运动，号召全体职工对行政和工会提意见，以改进我们的工作，搞好生产。光华纺织厂  厂长  冯新  工会主席  黄成田
