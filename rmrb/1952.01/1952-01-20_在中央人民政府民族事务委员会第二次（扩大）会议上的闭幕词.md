Comrade Zhang Xiruo, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the Central People's Government's Administrative Council, Chairman, Fellow Members, Fellow Representatives, Fellow Comrades:

Our meeting, from December 14, 1951, to today, has lasted a full eighteen days. If I were to say now that our eighteen-day meeting has been very good and we have gained a lot, I think everyone would probably not say that I am wrong!

First, at this meeting, we summarized the experiences of our nationalities work in various regions over the past two years. Generally speaking, this experience is very good. In these two years, we have first united all the nationalities of the country, abolished oppression and discrimination between nationalities, and created a truly united, mutually assisting, and friendly and cooperative big family. This is a major event among the nationalities of China and a major event in Chinese history, worthy of great fanfare. Secondly, we have also done a lot of work in terms of national democratic construction: at present, 113 national autonomous regions of various sizes and 165 national democratic coalition governments have been established throughout the country. In the economic, cultural, educational, and health aspects, a great deal of extremely important work has also been done, which has been of great help to the lives, health, and cultural development of the people of all nationalities in remote areas, and has been warmly welcomed by the people of all nationalities. The work of training cadres from minority nationalities has also achieved considerable success. At present, there are about 60,000 ethnic minority cadres who have been detached from production throughout the country. Although this is still far from enough, it cannot be considered small because it has only been two years. The movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has also achieved tremendous success in minority areas. The enthusiastic donation of airplanes and cannons in many places is a clear proof of this. These achievements are very good, and we should further expand and strengthen the unity and cooperation among all nationalities on the basis of these achievements in the future.

Second, the central issue and most important task of our meeting was to discuss the issue of national regional autonomy and to draft a bill on national regional autonomy for the Central People's Government to review and adopt. In addition, we have also fully discussed and considered local national democratic coalition governments, scattered minority ethnic components, the organization of national affairs committees of people's governments at all levels, and many other related issues.

In the discussion of these various issues, we clarified many specific situations and clarified many ideas and policies that were not clear before. To give an example, before the meeting, many people did not quite understand the meaning of national regional autonomy. But now everyone understands that national regional autonomy "is a regional autonomy within the territory of the People's Republic of China, under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, following the general path of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and based on areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities." Chairman Li Weihan explained in his report: "This is a general principle and a major prerequisite. There should be no wavering in this general principle and major prerequisite." This is indeed the basic spirit and principle of our national regional autonomy. All specific articles and measures are derived from this basic principle. If this basic principle is clarified, national regional autonomy can be done very well; if this basic principle is not understood or ignored, it will definitely not be done well. This is the most important point regarding the issue of national regional autonomy, and I hope that each of us can always keep it in mind.

There is one more point that may as well be said, that is, the development of our various minority nationalities is different, the economic and geographical environment is different, the living habits are different, and the intricate relationship with other nationalities is also different. Therefore, the implementation of national regional autonomy or national democratic coalition governments has become an extremely complex matter. Because the situation is complex, there cannot be a simple, uniform, and mechanical method. Comrades who do nationalities work should generally pay attention to the specific situation at that time and place, and special attention should be paid to these situations when implementing national regional autonomy. It is very dangerous to copy boilerplate articles from other places. Chairman Li has repeatedly pointed out this point, and I think this is a truth that does not tire of repetition, and I hope that everyone can pay full attention to it in practice.

Finally, I hope that when everyone returns to their respective regions, they can, in the spirit and understanding of this meeting, help the government and help the people of all nationalities to implement our policies of national regional autonomy and national democratic coalition government, so that this big family can develop more perfectly and happily.

    在中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次（扩大）会议上的闭幕词
    中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会副主任  张奚若主席、各位委员、各位代表、各位同志：
    我们这次的会议，从一九五一年十二月十四日起到今天，整整开了十八天。假如我现在说我们这十八天的会开得很好，收获很大，我想大家大概总不至于说我这话不对吧！
    第一、我们在这个会上总结了我们两年来各地民族工作的经验。这个经验一般地讲是很好的。我们在这两年中首先团结了全国各民族，废除了民族间的压迫和歧视，造成了一个真正团结互助、友爱合作的大家庭。这是中国各民族间一件大事情，也是中国历史上一件大事情，值得大书特书。其次，我们在民族民主建政方面也做了很多的工作：现在全国各地已建立了一百一十三个大小不同的民族自治区和一百六十五个民族民主联合政府。在经济、文教、卫生各方面，也都做了许多极其重要的工作，对于边远地区各民族人民的生活、健康和文化发展也都有极大的帮助，为各民族人民所热烈欢迎。培养少数民族干部工作也有很可观的成绩。现在全国各地区有六万左右脱离生产的民族干部。这虽然还很不够，但因只有两年时间，不能算少。抗美援朝运动，在少数民族地区亦有巨大的成就。许多地方踊跃捐献飞机大炮就是一个明证。这些成绩都是很好的，我们以后应在这些成绩的基础上更进一步地扩大和加强各民族间的团结和合作。
    第二、我们这次会议的中心问题和最主要的任务是讨论民族区域自治问题，并起草一个有关民族区域自治的法案，提供中央人民政府审核采择。此外，我们对于地方民族民主联合政府、散居的少数民族成分、各级人民政府民族事务委员会的组织以及其他许多有关问题，也都作了充分的讨论和考虑。
    在这些各种不同的问题的讨论中，我们明了了许多具体的情况，弄清了许多原来没有弄清楚的思想和政策。举一个例子来说，民族区域自治的意义，在开会前，许多人是不大明了的。可是现在大家都明了民族区域自治“是中华人民共和国领土之内的，在中央人民政府统一领导下的，遵循着中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的总道路前进的，以少数民族聚居区为基础的区域自治”。李维汉主任委员在他的报告中曾解释说：“这是一个总原则和大前提。对这个总原则和大前提，不可有任何的动摇。”这的确是我们民族区域自治的基本精神和原则。一切具体条文和办法都是由这个基本原则演绎出来的。弄清了这个基本原则，民族区域自治就可以搞得很好；不明白或忽略了这个基本原则，它就一定搞不好。这是关于民族区域自治问题的最重要的一点，我希望我们每个人都能时常把它记在心里。
    还有一点，也不妨再说一下，那就是，我们的各少数民族发展的情况不同，经济与地理环境不同，生活习惯不同，与他民族的错综关系也不同，因此，实行民族区域自治或民族民主联合政府就成为一件极其复杂的事情。因为情形复杂，就不能有一个简单的、一律的、机械的办法。做民族工作的同志一般地都应注意当时当地的具体情况，而实行民族区域自治时尤应注意这些情况。抄袭别处的印板文章是非常危险的。李主任委员对于这一点已经屡次指出，我想这是一个不厌重复的真理，希望大家在实践上能充分注意。
    最后，我希望大家回到各地时能本着我们这次开会的精神和了解，帮助政府，帮助各民族人民，贯彻我们的民族区域自治和民族民主联合政府政策，使这个大家庭发展得更加美满，更加幸福。
