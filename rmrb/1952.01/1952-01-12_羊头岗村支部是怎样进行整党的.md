How the Yangtougang Village Branch Rectified the Party
　　Pei Lan

　　Yangtougang Village in Fangshan County, Hebei Province, was liberated in the winter of 1948. In March 1949, a grassroots party organization was established during the land reform movement. Before the party rectification in July of last year, a total of twenty-one party members were developed, including two workers (one industrial worker and one handicraft worker), fourteen farm laborers and poor peasants, and five middle peasants. The work enthusiasm of the party members was generally high: In 1949, the branch led the masses in planting special crops with great success and was selected as a model branch; in 1951, the branch led the whole village in planting cotton, exceeding the task by one time, and won the title of model production village.

　　However, the Yangtougang Village Branch, all party members had not undergone severe tests, nor had they received systematic party education. In the three or four months after the establishment of the party in this village, the Fangshan First District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party only sent cadres to help them hold several group meetings and give several party lectures. After that, they did not come even once every half a year. Party members did not know the party program and constitution, and were even more unclear about the future of the revolution. For example, the branch secretary, Chang Zhenming, said: "After joining the party, I only knew to work resolutely for the party and not to collude with landlords. I don't know what will happen in the future." Some other party members said: "Being a party member means taking the lead in this and guaranteeing that. When will there be an end?" They gradually buried themselves in production and did not care about politics.

　　Also, because party members lacked basic party knowledge or were not politically enthusiastic, they did not struggle against some serious wrongdoings that harmed the interests of the party. For example, Liu Cai, the branch propaganda committee member, "flattered superiors and bullied subordinates, attributed success to himself, and blamed others for mistakes." Village branch meetings were held at Liu Cai's house, and Liu Cai's mother (a non-party member) also participated; some resolutions of the branch could be overturned if Liu Cai's mother did not agree. The party members said:
　　"In Yangtougang Village, when Liu Cai stomped his feet, all four streets trembled." "Liu Cai's mother is the village head of Yangtougang Village." The masses called Liu Cai's mother the "Empress Dowager." District cadres stayed at Liu Cai's house when they came to Yangtougang Village and readily believed Liu Cai's opinions, which fostered Liu Cai's dominance ideology and caused serious disunity within the party.

　　Based on the ideological situation of the party members, the party rectification work group first educated the party members on the communist future and the nature of the party. They used storytelling to explain the situation of the Soviet people using machines for production and their happy lives. And it was explained that in a communist society, class exploitation would be completely eliminated, social productive forces would be highly developed, everyone would work together, production would be abundant, and laborers could "each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." At that time, there would be no more poverty and sorrow. After listening to the work group's explanation, many party members said in the discussion: "The revolution is really good. Our current production and life are far behind those of communist society. We are really bad because we were satisfied after implementing land reform!"

　　As soon as the party members understood the future of communism, some advocated immediately organizing the village into platoons and companies, engaging in production together, and eating at the sound of a bell. Some people had some concerns: "If the land belongs to the state, and all the furniture and cabinets also belong to the state, it won't be convenient for us to use them ourselves." At this time, the work group explained: Although the private ownership of the means of production would be completely eliminated in a communist society, the means of livelihood would still be controlled by individuals. A family would still live together, and what they wanted to eat and wear would be up to them. At the same time, it also explained how to reach a communist society. It pointed out that China's current conditions are still far from a communist society, and every Communist Party member must now strive to consolidate and build a new democratic society and create conditions for national industrialization in order to transition to socialist and communist societies. After everyone listened to the above principles, they unanimously recognized the greatness of the communist cause. They understood that there was still a difficult struggle to reach a communist society.

　　Although a small number of party members knew that the Communist Party was the party of the working class, they could not explain why. Most party members did not understand the working class. They said: "Our village implemented land reform based on Chairman Mao's instructions, but we have never seen a worker." At this time, the work group introduced the situation of large-scale machine production, which made everyone recognize the power of the working class. Fangshan County produces coal, and the East Mine is a coal mine where coal is mined by machines, and there are also many small coal mines where coal is mined manually. Some party members had transported coal from machine kilns and also from manual kilns. The work group seized this specific example and encouraged party members to do the math. All party members said: "On careful consideration, manual labor and machines are fundamentally incomparable." In the discussion of large-scale machine production, the work group also introduced the production and living conditions of industrial workers in the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. They read the news published in the People's Daily about the Soviet Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory manufacturing a new car in four minutes and the newsletter "Automated Factory—A Prototype of a Communist Society Factory." The party members' minds were broadened, and they unanimously said: "The working class is truly great. Such large machines only need a few people to command them; we are in the village all day long, going to the fields and back home with hoes and sickles. Our vision is too short." Party member Zhang Jizhi, who had worked in the Datong Coal Mine, introduced many things he had seen with his own eyes. He said: "In large factories, workers work collectively and live collectively; work has a fixed time. When they go to work, they concentrate on their work, and the implementation of organizational rules is very strict. It won't work if we are as scattered as we are in our village." After all the party members listened to the above principles and situation, and also saw some facts with their own eyes, they became even more convinced that the working class has unlimited prospects for development and is a creative class. They are organized and disciplined, and they all said that they must learn from the working class elder brothers.

　　Next, the work group conducted party history education, explaining the process of the Chinese Communist Party from nothing to something, from small to large. After the failure of the Great Revolution, the main part and focus of the party shifted from the city to the countryside, leading the peasants to carry out armed struggle, accumulating strength, and implementing the encirclement of the city from the countryside; in the city, the party also led the working class to continue the heroic struggle against the enemy and puppets, until it cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to liberate the city. After listening to the party history introduction, the party members had preliminary party history knowledge, and then they knew: "It turns out that the workers have been revolutionizing for a long time." Therefore, they truly recognized the leading role of the working class in their minds.

　　In conducting the education on the standards of party members, the work group also focused on explaining the principle that Communist Party members must heroically persist in revolutionary struggle for life, and that the personal interests of party members must be subordinate to the interests of the people, that is, the interests of the party. It detailed many examples of revolutionary martyrs who were staunch and unyielding and fought heroically. For example, the young female Communist Party member Liu Hulan heroically persisted in the struggle against the enemy, "living great, dying gloriously," and the explosion hero Dong Cunrui sacrificed himself to destroy the enemy's bunker, ensuring the victory of the battle, and other deeds, which greatly inspired the party members' awareness. Afterwards, the party members criticized the erroneous thinking of "conditionally obeying the party, working if the work is satisfactory, and not working if it is not satisfactory" and "half-hearted revolution, selfishness and self-interest." For example, after studying the topics of communism and the Communist Party, party member Cui Zanming launched a fierce struggle in his heart. He didn't go out for two days, thinking over and over again: "Should I continue to be a party member, or not? Eating is necessary whether you are a party member or not. I can move a little bit and eat by myself anyway. Why bother?" Therefore, he always thought: "Being a party member is always much more troublesome than being a member of the masses." If he didn't become one, he saw that the Communist Party was so great, and communist society was so good. After inner struggle and the help of comrades, he realized that "it must be done." He believed that "the revolution must be carried out to the end, and a half-hearted revolution is shameful." Chang Zhenming reviewed his mistake of losing the party's principles: "I was the branch secretary and the village head at that time, but I couldn't make decisions on anything and had to listen to Liu Cai. The party members and the masses said that I was 'soft-eared, honest-hearted, and indecisive.' Because I didn't understand that there were good weapons of criticism and self-criticism within the party, I was afraid that Liu Cai would come up with a bad idea that I couldn't handle, 'the arm couldn't twist the thigh.' Looking back now, I am a Communist Party member. It is equal to destroying the party myself if I do not struggle against the wrong thoughts and actions that violate the interests of the party. This is my biggest mistake. This party rectification educated me, and a dark cloud in the sky was blown away by the wind. I am bright from the bottom of my heart. From now on, I am determined to work hard to compensate for this loss." For the benefit of the party and the people, every party member strictly examined his own erroneous thoughts and launched a struggle against Liu Cai's erroneous thoughts. Some party members proposed: "Liu Cai took too much of the fruits of victory; concealed black land; drove a large cart to do business, privately made 'self-produced certificates,' smuggled and evaded taxes, and violated national laws." Some party members proposed: "In the past, the branch meetings were always held at Liu Cai's house, and Liu Cai's mother and family members all participated. Party affairs were instead decided by Liu Cai's mother. At the end of the land reform, a part of the fruit trees was exclusively occupied by Liu Cai. According to the opinions of the masses, the branch decided to redistribute these trees, but Liu Cai privately cut down the trees and made furniture." Everyone gave Liu Cai a total of forty-three opinions. Liu Cai not only did not accept criticism, but instead said: "There is heaven above, there is earth below, and there is a heart in the middle." In the end, everyone took out human and physical evidence, and Liu Cai only admitted three items. The party rectification work group talked to Liu Cai three times successively, and the Fangshan First District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also talked to him, but he still insisted on his mistakes. Seeing that Liu Cai was already an uneducable element, all party members unanimously requested to expel him from the party to purify the party organization. The branch then made a decision and reported it to the county party committee for approval.

　　The Yangtougang Village Branch's party rectification work has yielded great results. The common response of party members is: "The explanation is clear, and the discussion is detailed." "We have a direction, which is more important than anything else." Every party member keeps the party member standards in a notebook, carries it with them, and takes it out to look at it at any time during work. Party members said: "Now everyone of us carries an 'inspector' with us, who checks our thoughts, work, and style at any time." After the party rectification, the work enthusiasm of party members has been improved. The party members who were always more active in the past are now more active. Those who were not active in the past are now also active. Party member Ma Peng is the sanitation committee member, who was a nominal position in the past. Now he takes the initiative to lead the masses to clean the streets and goes deep into each household to publicize the importance of hygiene. The masses all said: "Ma Peng has changed, he has become a good party member!" The representative of the masses, Huang Dehai, said: "Now the party member cadres are all working actively, without substituting or monopolizing things for others, and without private collusion. When they need to go on business trips, they go on business trips. The work is really easy to do. I am very happy to participate in the party rectification study as a nonvoting delegate. Party members have standards, and I am also working hard towards this standard."

    羊头岗村支部是怎样进行整党的
    培蓝
    河北房山县羊头岗村是一九四八年冬天解放的。一九四九年三月，在土地改革运动中，建立了党的基层组织。到去年七月整党以前，共发展党员二十一名，其中有两个工人（一个产业工人，一个手工业工人），十四个雇农、贫农，五个中农。党员的工作情绪，一般是很高的：一九四九年，支部领导群众种植特种作物很有成绩，被选为模范支部；一九五一年，支部领导全村群众种棉，超过任务一倍，又获得了生产模范村的称呼。
    但是，羊头岗村支部，全体党员没有经过严重的考验，没有受过党的系统的教育。这村建党后的三四个月当中，中共房山一区区委会，只是派干部帮助他们开过几次小组会，讲过几次党课，这以后，半年都不来一次。党员对党纲党章都不知道，对革命前途更是摸不清。如支部书记常振明说：“我入党以后，只知道坚决为党工作，不和地主拉拢，将来怎么样不知道。”另有些党员说：“当党员这也带头，那也保证，什么时候有个头儿呢？”他们逐渐埋头生产，不问政治。
    又由于党员十分缺乏党的基本知识；或政治情绪不高，所以对一些严重地违害党的利益的错误行为，不进行斗争。如支部宣传委员刘才，“捧上欺下，功则归己，过则归人”。村支部会议都在刘才家里开，刘才母亲（非党员）也参加；支部的某些决议，如果刘才母亲不同意，就可以推翻。党员说：
    “刘才在羊头岗村，把脚一跺，四街乱颤。”“羊头岗村村长是刘才他妈当的。”群众称刘才妈是“母皇后”。区干部到羊头岗村，就住在刘才家，遇事轻信刘才的意见，助长了刘才的统治思想，造成了党内的严重的不团结现象。
    根据党员的思想情况，整党工作组首先对党员进行了共产主义前途和党的性质的教育。他们用说故事的方法，讲解苏联人民用机器生产的情形，和快乐幸福的生活情形。并且说明，到了共产主义社会，彻底消灭了阶级剥削，社会生产力高度发展，大家共同劳动，生产品丰富了，劳动者可以“各尽所能，各取所需”。那时候，再没有什么贫困和忧愁了。听了工作组的讲解，好多党员在讨论中说：“革命果真是好，咱们现在的生产和生活，和共产主义社会比，可差远了。咱们刚刚实行了土地改革，就满足了，真差劲！”
    党员刚刚懂得了共产主义的前途，有的就主张马上在村里编成班，编成排，一齐生产，打钟吃饭。有些人则产生了一些顾虑：“土地归了国有，一切家具、柜子也都归了国家，自己想用，可就不方便了。”这时工作组说明：到了共产主义社会虽然彻底消灭了生产资料的私有制度，但是生活资料还是归各人自己支配。自己一家人，还是住在一起，愿意吃什么，穿什么，都由自己作主。同时，又说明了怎样到达共产主义社会。指出中国现在的条件，离共产主义社会还很远，每个共产党员，现在必须为巩固和建设新民主主义社会而奋斗，创造国家工业化的条件，以便过渡到社会主义和共产主义社会。大家听了以上这些道理，一致承认了共产主义事业的伟大。懂得了到达共产主义社会还有一段艰苦斗争的路程。
    有一小部分党员虽然知道共产党是工人阶级的政党，但是说不出理由。大部分党员不了解工人阶级。他们说：“咱村实行土地改革，是毛主席的指示，就没有看见过工人。”这时，工作组介绍了大机器生产的情形，使大家认识了工人阶级的力量。房山县产煤，东矿就是一座用机器挖煤的煤矿，另外也有许多人工挖煤的小煤矿。有的党员到机器窑运过煤，也到人工窑运过煤，工作组抓住了这个具体事例，启发党员算账。全体党员说：“细细想来，人工和机器根本不能相比。”在讨论大机器生产中，工作组又介绍了北京石景山发电厂、石景山钢铁厂的产业工人的生产和生活情形。读了人民日报登载的苏联莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂，四分钟制造一辆新汽车的新闻和“自动工厂——共产主义社会工厂的雏型”的通讯。党员思想开朗了，一致说：“工人阶级真是伟大，那样大的机器，只要几个人指挥就行；咱们整天在村里，上地回家，锄头镰刀，眼光太短小了。”党员张继志过去在大同煤矿作过工，他介绍了亲眼见过的许多事情，他说：“在大工厂里，工人集体工作，集体生活；工作有一定的时间，上了班，集中精力干活，组织制度的执行都很严格。像我们村里这么散漫，那可不成。”全体党员听了上面的道理和情况，加上亲眼也看到过一些事实，更加相信了工人阶级是有无限发展前途的，是富有创造性的阶级，他们有组织有纪律，都说必须向工人老大哥学习。
    接着，工作组进行了党史教育，说明了中国共产党从无到有，由小到大的过程。在大革命失败后，党的主要部分和斗争重点，由城市转到农村，领导农民进行武装斗争，并积聚力量，实行乡村包围城市；在城市，党又领导工人阶级继续和敌伪进行英勇的斗争，直到配合解放军解放城市。党员听了党史介绍，有了初步党史知识，这才知道：“原来工人早就革命了。”于是在思想上真正承认了工人阶级的领导作用。
    在进行党员标准的教育中，工作组又着重地讲解了共产党员必须终身英勇地坚持革命斗争，党员的个人利益必须服从人民的即党的利益的道理。详细介绍了许多革命先烈坚贞不屈、英勇奋斗的事例。如年青的女共产党员刘胡兰英勇坚持对敌斗争，
    “生的伟大，死的光荣”，爆炸英雄董存瑞，舍身炸毁了敌人的碉堡，保证了战斗胜利等等事迹，这样大大地启发了党员的觉悟。之后，党员们批判了“有条件地服从党，工作顺心就干，不顺心就不干”和“半截革命，自私自利”的错误思想。如党员崔赞明在学习了共产主义和共产党这一课题以后，内心展开了激烈的斗争。他两天没有出门，翻来覆去地想：“继续当个党员呢，还是不当？当党员也得吃饭，不当党员也得吃饭，我一个人好歹动弹点就可以吃，费这心干啥？”因此，他总认为：“当党员总是比当群众麻烦得多。”要是不当吧，他又看到共产党这么伟大，共产主义社会又是那么好。经过了内心斗争和同志们的帮助，他认识到“非干不成”。认为“革命要革到底，半截革命是可耻的。”常振明检讨了自己失掉党的原则的错误：“我那时是支部书记，又是村长，可是什么事也作不了主，都得听刘才的话。党员群众说我‘耳软、心实、没主张’，我因为不懂得党内有批评和自我批评的好武器，只怕刘才出个坏点子吃不消，‘胳膊扭不过大腿’。现在想起来，我是个共产党员，对违背党的利益的错误思想和行动，不进行斗争，就等于我自己破坏了党，这是我的最大错误。这次整党教育了我，天上一块乌云被风吹散了，我从心眼里亮堂了，今后要决心努力工作，来补偿这个损失。”为了党和人民的利益，每个党员都严格地检查了自己的错误思想，并且向刘才的错误思想展开了斗争。有的党员提出：“刘才多占胜利果实；隐瞒黑地；赶大车做买卖，私制‘自产证’，走私漏税，违犯国家法律。”有的党员提出：“过去支部开会总在刘才家，刘才母亲和家里人全参加。党内的事情倒被刘才母亲作了主。土地改革结束时，有一部分果实树被刘才独占，支部根据群众的意见，决定把这些树重行分配，而刘才私自把树砍了，作了家具。”大家一共给刘才提出了四十三条意见。刘才不仅不接受批评，反说：“上有天，下有地，中间有心。”最后，大家拿出了人证物证，刘才只承认了三条。整党工作组先后找刘才谈话三次，中共房山县一区区委也和他作了谈话，他还是坚持错误。全体党员看到刘才已经是不可教育的分子，为了纯洁党的组织，一致要求开除他的党籍，支部乃作出决定，并报告县委批准。
    羊头岗村支部的这次整党工作的收获很大。党员共同的反应是：“讲得清楚，讨论得细致。”“我们有了方向，这比什么都重要。”每个党员都把党员标准记在本子上，随身带着，在工作中随时掏出来看看。党员都说：“现在咱们每个人身上，都带着一个‘检查员’，随时检查咱们的思想、工作和作风。”经过整党，党员的工作情绪提高了。过去一贯比较积极的党员，现在更积极了。过去不积极的，现在也都积极起来了。党员马鹏是卫生委员，过去有名无实。现在他主动地领导群众，扫除街道，并深入各户宣传应该讲究卫生，群众都说：“马鹏变样啦，成了个好党员啦！”群众代表黄德海说：“现在党员干部都是积极工作，又不包办代替，没有私人拉拢，该出差一样出差，工作真好作了。这次我列席参加整党学习，我真高兴，党员有标准，我也朝着这个标准努力。”
