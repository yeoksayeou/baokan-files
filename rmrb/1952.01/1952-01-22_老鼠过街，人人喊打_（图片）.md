    (X) Ji Feng and Zhao Zhi finally understood completely. They planned to send Zhao Ren back to Wuqing County to be dealt with by the local People's Government. Ji Feng wrote a letter to the local People's Government of Wuqing County, denouncing Zhao Ren, and Zhao Zhi was to escort Zhao Ren back. However, when Zhao Zhi returned to the factory and discussed it with others, they advised him that it was not necessary to go to such trouble and that it would be better to report him in Tianjin.
    (XI) Without resting, Zhao Zhi called his second brother Ji Feng, and together they went to the Mongolian Road Police Station in District One to report Zhao Ren.
    (XII) It turned out that Wang Xiru had already done this. Wang Xiru loved his nephew very much, but since Zhao Ren had stolen state property, he had to hand him over to the government to be reformed and allowed to start a new life. After thinking it through, he first reported to the police station and then went directly to the People's Procuratorate to denounce Zhao Ren. (The End)

    （十）冀峰和赵智这才完全明白。他们计划把赵仁送回武清县交当地人民政府去处理。就由冀峰执笔给武清县当地人民政府写了一封检举赵仁的信，准备由赵智送赵仁回去。但是，赵智回到工厂和别人一商量，别人劝他不必这样费事，不如在天津市检举。
    （十一）赵智没有歇下腿就又打电话给他二哥冀峰，他俩一起跑到一区蒙古路派出所去检举了赵仁。
    （十二）原来在这以前，王锡儒已经这样做了。王锡儒很爱他的外甥，但是既然赵仁盗窃了国家资财，只有把他交给政府，由政府改造他，让他重新做人，这样才对得起国家和人民。他这样想通了以后，先到派出所报告，又直接去人民检察署检举了赵仁。（完）
