Central People's Government Ministry of Communications General Office Director Zhang Wen'ang
Dismissed and Investigated for Obstructing the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Campaign

[Our Newspaper News] Zhang Wen'ang, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government, has been dismissed and is under investigation for suppressing democracy and taking a confrontational attitude towards the movement in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign because his own hands are not clean.

Since December 1951, the Ministry of Communications began studying the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. At that time, the masses were in high spirits, unanimously thanking and supporting Chairman Mao's wise decision. They believed that this campaign could thoroughly eliminate the serious phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy within the agency in the past and thoroughly rectify the work of the Ministry of Communications. However, on the contrary, Zhang Wen'ang, in such a great and unprecedented political movement, not only did not seriously conduct self-criticism, but also tried every means to obstruct the progress of the movement and took a completely confrontational attitude towards the opinions raised by the masses.

At the beginning of the movement, Zhang Wen'ang demoted or transferred comrades who were usually dissatisfied with his leadership style and extravagant behavior to inspect work elsewhere. Liu Wenlun, Director of the Finance Department, was demoted to Deputy Director and transferred to participate in land reform because he had raised many opinions about Zhang Wen'ang's style in the 1950 rectification movement; Zhang Wen'ang then privately transferred a Deputy Director from the Navigation Bureau who was not content with his work to the Finance Department to serve as Director. Similarly, Mao Cheng, Acting Director of the River Transport Bureau, and Liu Leisan, Deputy Director, were both cadres who had been suppressed by Zhang Wen'ang in the past, and were also transferred by Zhang Wen'ang to inspect work in this movement. At that time, many comrades pointed out that these comrades knew a lot about the leadership and the overall situation of the Ministry of Communications, and should be allowed to participate in this movement. Zhang Wen'ang said: "It has been decided, and it cannot be changed." Many comrades were very dissatisfied with Zhang's methods. Before leaving, Liu Wenlun said to his comrades with great pain: "I am leaving, but I believe that the problems of the Ministry of Communications will be satisfactorily resolved under the leadership of the Party."

Another manifestation of Zhang Wen'ang's resistance to this movement was his attempt to quickly shift the focus of the movement to the lower-level staff of the Ministry of Communications.

Before December 15, 1951, after Zhang Wen'ang made a mobilization speech at the party member's congress, he decided to end the internal movement of the Ministry of Communications within three weeks and quickly promote the movement to various bureaus. Zhang Wen'ang not only limited the time of the movement very short, but also did not provide specific leadership for the movement. Zhang Wen'ang also intentionally brought his trusted people and those cadres who usually colluded with him into the thrift inspection committee. However, the enthusiasm of the masses was high. Despite Zhang Wen'ang's obstruction of the movement, the masses still actively put forward many opinions on how to carry out the movement. Zhang Wen'ang not only ignored these opinions, but even unreasonably rejected the opinions of the comrades. For example, when Zhang Mingru and Guo Jiaxiu, the Director and Deputy Director of the Secretariat, respectively, gave Zhang Wen'ang their opinions, Zhang Wen'ang said: "If you have any opinions, raise them at the Party's group meeting." He rejected them in one sentence. When Guo Jiaxiu and others approached Zhang Wen'ang for the second time to give their opinions, Zhang Wen'ang said as soon as he saw them: "You always have opinions. There are too many people giving opinions in the Ministry of Communications. If you have any opinions, raise them to the branch. I will not consider anyone's opinions." Guo Jiaxiu patiently explained to him: "Director Zhang, don't get angry first. You are the Deputy Secretary of the Party Group. Why can't we Party members give you our opinions?" Zhang Wen'ang still didn't consider it and left angrily. Under the urging of the masses, although Zhang Wen'ang also participated in various meetings, he was very reluctant and unenthusiastic.

Zhang Wen'ang's mistakes of not distinguishing between public and private matters, extravagance, and encroaching on public property for personal gain were very serious. However, he always adopted a dishonest attitude towards his mistakes and even retaliated against the masses who gave him opinions. Zhang Wen'ang was also forced to conduct self-criticism, but his attitude was extremely dishonest. Many problems, even those already exposed by the masses, were not mentioned. Zhang Wen'ang once privately withheld 189 barrels of gasoline and 200 bolts of cloth. Ma Ji, Chief of the General Affairs Section, personally approached Zhang Wen'ang and asked him to confess this problem, but he said: "This is a small matter. At most, it is a matter of not distinguishing between public and private. You people are afraid of taking responsibility. You don't need to worry about it. I will take responsibility." Zhang Wen'ang pushed the gasoline problem to the Transportation Bureau, saying that the gasoline was purchased by the Transportation Bureau. Later, after being exposed, he admitted to withholding 60 barrels of gasoline. He had taken eight public Russian blankets for himself, but said that there were only three, and that he had already handed these blankets over to the General Affairs Office (in fact, they were not handed over to the General Affairs Office at that time). The masses were extremely dissatisfied with such a self-criticism and discussed it one after another, saying: "The tiger is there, but it is difficult to strike." The masses continued to expose Zhang Wen'ang's extravagance and bureaucracy. When the comrades of the Thrift Inspection Committee reflected these opinions to Zhang Wen'ang, Zhang said impatiently:

"Anyway, I am the tiger. Let them criticize me!" and tried to attack those comrades who criticized his self-criticism as not thorough. Ji Yun, Director of the Labor and Wage Department, criticized Zhang Wen'ang's self-criticism at an enlarged meeting of the Party Group, asking him to continue his self-criticism. The next day, at the Thrift Inspection Committee, Zhang Wen'ang said: "Ji Yun, we leaders have bureaucracy, but don't you have bureaucracy? Why don't you criticize yourself and only criticize others? Your American-style nursery cannot be exempted from inspection." After the meeting, Zhang Wen'ang asked Qiao Yi (his wife) to call Ji Yun, asking Ji Yun to organize an inspection team to inspect the nursery, and personally approached Ji Yun, saying:

"Your nursery has not been inspected yet. You should organize an inspection soon."

The masses were very indignant at Zhang Wen'ang's mistake of resisting the movement. However, under Zhang Wen'ang's suppression, everyone did not dare to publicly expose him, so they wrote letters to the wall newspapers and newspapers to expose Zhang's mistakes. Even so, they were still suppressed by Zhang Wen'ang. Lin Yizhong, Director of the Private Enterprise Section, sent a material to this newspaper on the issue of wasting more than 10 million yuan on building an artificial mountain. This newspaper sent this letter back to the Ministry of Communications, asking them to review it. Zhang Wen'ang asked Guo Jiaxiu, Deputy Director of the Secretariat, to write a self-criticism. Guo Jiaxiu wrote a self-criticism, explaining the actual waste and the masses' reaction to this issue, and submitted it to Zhang Wen'ang for review. Zhang Wen'ang scolded Guo Jiaxiu, saying: "Are you blind? Don't you go and see if it is really wasteful?" Guo Jiaxiu replied: "Does the newspaper criticism accept it or not?" Zhang said: "Accept it and don't accept it!" He ordered Guo Jiaxiu to rewrite it and told Guo: The waste of building the artificial mountain is at most one-fifth. Zhang Wen'ang saw the opinions given to him by the masses on the blackboard newspaper, and used excuses such as "many opinions do not conform to the facts" and "deliberately exaggerated" to propose that the blackboard newspaper should be led to avoid deviations, and asked Yang Anping, Secretary of the General Branch, to issue a notice, asking everyone to not make allegations without evidence when giving opinions, in order to suppress criticism. In this way, the blackboard newspaper was also controlled by him. Zhang Wen'ang also used threatening methods to suppress the masses from giving opinions. He once said to Xiong Zhenzuo, Deputy Director of the Planning Department: "Do you want to put all the problems on the leaders? Even if all the problems are put on the leaders, the higher authorities will not dismiss them." and openly said to the cadres of the Ministry of Communications: "If the Ministry of Communications brings me, Zhang Wen'ang, down, will the problem be solved?"

Under the influence of Zhang Wen'ang's erroneous behavior of resisting the movement and suppressing democracy, the cadres who stood with him in the past also tried to avoid or resist the movement. Wang Yuanzhang, Director of the Supply Department, who was promoted by Zhang Wen'ang, is a concrete example. At the beginning of the movement, Wang Yuanzhang refused the inspection team of the Thrift Inspection Committee to inspect him. And he planned to disperse many of the main cadres of the Supply Department to inspect work outside (some were not sent out after being discovered by the leadership). Most of the members of the Thrift Inspection Team were personnel close to Wang Yuanzhang. In order to avoid inspection, Wang Yuanzhang also established an accounting team, specializing in settling the accounts of the Supply Department, in order to avoid the inspection team's inspection. Wang Yuanzhang said to the cadres of the accounting team: "When the inspection team comes, give them the newly calculated accounts. Don't let them see the original accounts and documents." What is even more wrong is that Wang Yuanzhang organized a secret team (publicly called the "Secretarial Team"), specializing in secretly investigating the facts of corruption and waste in units such as the Highway Bureau, Nursery, Transportation Hospital, and Construction Company, in order to shift the focus of the struggle. Wang Yuanzhang said: "They are here to criticize me, and I will criticize them too!" Why did Wang Yuanzhang dare to resist the movement in this way? The main reason is that Zhang Wen'ang supported him.

The reason why Zhang Wen'ang wanted to resist the movement and suppress democracy was mainly because his own hands were too dirty, and the problem was very serious.

According to the materials that have now been examined, the problem is very serious. Zhang Wen'ang's thinking has changed since 1949. At that time, Zhang, in the position of Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Communications of the North China People's Government, requested a car and a set of Western tableware worth seven to eight million yuan from the Tianjin Merchants Bureau and took them for his own use. After Zhang Wen'ang was appointed Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government, he often paid attention to personal enjoyment. Zhang Wen'ang has eaten in all the famous restaurants in Beijing, and he has also seen all the theaters. Zhang Wen'ang often accepts valuable gifts from local agencies of the Ministry of Communications, such as ginseng, ginseng fruit, deer antler essence, deer tendons, and ham. Under his influence, giving gifts has become a trend in the Ministry of Communications. Cadres sent out to work must give gifts to Zhang Wen'ang. Zhang also spent 3 million yuan of public funds to buy a very good watch. As a result of Zhang Wen'ang's extravagance and waste, he had to embezzle public funds. Zhang once asked the Supply Department to subsidize the agency with 1 billion yuan and allowed Wang Yuanzhang to engage in speculative business. According to preliminary statistics, the hidden profits of the Supply Department (changing public to small public) have reached more than 90 billion yuan. In 1951, Zhang Wen'ang again changed public to small public, using more than 5.82 billion yuan. Zhang Wen'ang often considered the issue of how to be "grand" enough. When Zhang Wen'ang went to Tianjin, he carefully observed the various styles of buildings in Tianjin, and he planned to absorb the advantages of various styles of buildings to build a beautiful building. His dormitory originally did not have heating equipment, but he wasted more than 30 million yuan of public funds to install heating and a boiler (Zhang and several directors lived in a dormitory, but other directors did not have heating installed). Zhang Wen'ang also wasted more than 16 million yuan of public funds to repair the artificial mountain, build pavilions and ditches, and red and green electric lights were installed in the ditches (later they were removed because the pool leaked). All this shows that Zhang Wen'ang has been infected with serious bourgeois ideas. In addition, Zhang Wen'ang also privately decided to subsidize staff with a total of 296 million yuan for cotton clothing and a total of 167 million yuan for heating expenses.

Now, Zhang Wen'ang has been dismissed from his positions as Director of the General Office and Deputy Secretary of the Party Group of the Ministry of Communications of the Communist Party of China by the State Council of the Central People's Government and the Party Committee of the Central People's Government of the Communist Party of China, respectively. The Thrift Inspection Committee of the Ministry of Communications is still continuing to investigate Zhang's other problems. (Zhu Bo)

    中央人民政府交通部办公厅主任张文昂
    阻碍反贪污浪费运动被撤职查办
    【本报讯】中央人民政府交通部办公厅主任张文昂，因为自己手上不干净，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中压制民主，对运动采取对抗态度，已被撤职查办。
    从一九五一年十二月起，交通部就开始了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的学习。当时群众情绪高昂，一致感谢和拥护毛主席这一英明的决定。认为这一次可以很好地把过去机关内部贪污浪费和官僚主义的严重现象彻底肃清，把交通部的工作彻底整顿一次。但是恰恰相反，张文昂在这样伟大的、史无前例的政治运动中，不仅没有认真进行检讨，而且想尽办法阻碍运动的进行，并对群众提出的意见，完全抱着对抗的态度。
    运动开始，张文昂把平时对他的领导作风和铺张浪费行为不满意的同志，有的降职，有的调出去检查工作。财务处处长刘文仑因在一九五○年整风运动中，对张文昂的作风方面曾提出很多意见，即被降为副处长，并被调参加土地改革；而张文昂则私自从航务局调来一个不安心工作的副处长到财务处当处长。又如河运总局代理局长茅程、副局长刘乐三等都是过去被张文昂打击过的干部，在这次运动中也被张文昂调出去检查工作。当时很多同志提出：这些同志对领导方面以及整个交通部的情况了解较多，应该让他们参加这次运动。张文昂却说：“已经决定了，就不能改变了。”许多同志对张这种手段很不满意。刘文仑临走时，很痛心地和同志们说：“我走了，但是我相信交通部的问题在党的领导下，会得到圆满的解决。”
    张文昂对抗这次运动的另一个表现，是企图把运动的锋芒很快地转移到交通部下层工作人员中去。
    一九五一年十二月十五日以前，张文昂在党员大会上进行了动员后，就决定要在三个礼拜内结束交通部内部的运动，把运动迅速推向各局去。张文昂不但把运动的时间限制得很短，并且对运动不作具体的领导。张文昂并且有意地把他所信任的人，和那些平时和他狼狈为奸的干部拉进节约检查委员会。但是，群众的情绪是高昂的，尽管张文昂阻挠运动，群众仍然积极地对如何开展运动提出了很多意见。张文昂不但把这些意见置于脑后，甚至无理地拒绝同志们的意见。如秘书处正副处长张明如、郭家秀等向张文昂提出意见时，张文昂说：“你们有意见在党的小组会上提。”一句话给碰回来了。郭家秀等第二次又找张文昂提意见时，张一看见他们就说：“你们老是有意见，交通部提意见的人太多了，你们有意见向支部提，谁的意见我也不考虑。”郭家秀很耐心地向他解释说：“张主任，你先不用生气，你是党组副书记，我们党员为什么不可以给你提意见呢？”张文昂仍然不加考虑，愤愤而去。在群众的督促下，张文昂虽然也参加了各种会议，但是都是很勉强、很不积极的。
    张文昂平时公私不分、铺张浪费、侵大公肥小公的错误十分严重。他对自己的错误却一直采取不老实的态度，甚至对提意见的群众进行打击报复。张文昂也曾被迫地进行过检查，但是，态度极不老实，很多问题甚至连群众已经揭穿的问题，都没有谈出来。张文昂曾经私自扣留一百八十九桶汽油和二百匹布。总务科长马骥曾亲自找张文昂，要他把这一问题坦白出来，他竟说：“这是小事情，闹上去顶多是个公私不分。你们这些人怕负责任，你们不用管了，我来负责。”张文昂把汽油的问题推给运输局，并说这批汽油是运输局买的。后来经过揭发，才承认了扣留六十桶汽油。他曾把公家的八条俄国毯子据为己有，却说只有三条，而且还说已把这些毯子交给总务处了（实际上在当时没有交给总务处）。群众对这样的检讨极为不满，纷纷议论说：“老虎是有了，就是难打。”群众继续揭露张文昂铺张浪费和官僚主义的事实。当节约检查委员会的同志向张文昂反映这些意见时，张不耐烦地说：
    “反正我就是老虎，要他们整吧！”并想法打击那些批评他检查不深刻的同志。劳动工资处处长纪云在党组扩大会议上对张文昂的检讨提出批评，要求他继续检讨。第二天在节约检查委员会上，张文昂就说：“纪云，我们领导上有官僚主义，你就没有官僚主义？为什么你不检讨自己光批评别人？你办的美国式的托儿所不能不检查。”会议以后，张文昂就叫乔毅（他的爱人）给纪云打电话，要纪云组织检查小组，检查托儿所，并且亲自找纪云，说：
    “你们的托儿所还没有检查，应该很快组织检查。”
    群众对张文昂抗拒运动的错误非常愤慨。但在张文昂的压制下，大家不敢公开揭露，便给墙报写信，给报社写信，揭发张的错误。就这样也还是受到张文昂的压制。私营企业处处长林毅忠就修假山浪费一千多万元的问题，写了一份材料送给本报。本报把这封信送回交通部，请他们检讨。张文昂就要秘书处副处长郭家秀写检讨。郭家秀把浪费的实际情况和群众对这一问题的反映写了一个检讨交张文昂审阅。张文昂竟然责骂郭家秀说：“你瞎眼啦，不去看一看，真是浪费吗？”郭家秀回答说：“报纸批评你接受不接受？”张说：“也接受也不接受！”他又命令郭家秀重新写，并告诉郭说：修假山的浪费最多也不过五分之一。张文昂看到群众在黑板报上给他提的意见，就以“很多意见不合乎事实”，“故意夸大”等为藉口，提出办黑板报要有领导，免得出偏差，并要总支书记杨安平等发出通知，要大家提意见不能捕风捉影，来压制批评。这样黑板报也被他控制起来。张文昂还用威吓的手段来压制群众提意见，他对计划司副司长熊振作曾这样说：“你们是不是要把问题都搞到领导头上？即便问题都搞到领导的头上，上级也不会撤职的。”并公然向交通部的干部说：“交通部把我张文昂搞垮了，就解决问题了吗？”
    在张文昂这种对抗运动压制民主的错误行为影响下，过去和他站在一起的干部，也想法躲避或抗拒运动。经张文昂一手提拔起来的供应处处长王元章就是一个具体的例子。运动开始时，王元章拒绝节约检查委员会检查小组对他进行检查。并且有计划地把供应处很多主要干部分散到外边检查工作
    （领导方面发现后有的未被派出）。节约检查组大部分是和王元章靠近的人员。王元章为了躲避检查，还成立了算账小组，专门结算供应处的账目，以便躲避检查组的检查。王元章对算账小组的干部说：“检查组的人来了，就把新算的账给他们，不能让他们看原始账目和单据。”王元章更错误的是组织秘密小组（公开叫“秘书小组”），专门秘密地调查公路局、托儿所、交通医院、建筑公司等单位的贪污浪费事实，以转移斗争目标。王元章说：“他们来整我，我还整他们哩！”王元章为什么敢这样对抗运动呢？主要原因是张文昂给他撑腰作主。
    张文昂所以要对抗运动、压制民主，主要是他自己的手上太不干净，而且问题十分严重。
    据现在已经检查出来的材料看，问题是很严重的。张文昂从一九四九年起，思想已经起了变化。当时，张以华北人民政府交通部副部长的地位，在天津招商局要了一部小汽车，和一套价值七、八百万元的西餐用具占为私有。张文昂被任命为中央人民政府交通部办公厅主任后，经常注意的是个人生活享受问题。北京市所有出名的饭馆，张文昂都吃遍了，戏院子也都看遍了。张文昂经常接受交通部各地机关的贵重礼物，如人参、人参果、鹿茸精、鹿筋、火腿等。在他的影响下，送礼已成为交通部一股风气，派出去工作的干部，一定要给张文昂送礼。张并用公款三百万元买了一只很好的手表。张文昂铺张浪费的结果，就不得不挪用公款。张有一次要供应处补助机关十亿元，并允许王元章做投机生意。据初步统计，供应处埋伏利润（变大公为小公）已达九百多亿元。一九五一年，张文昂又化大公为小公，动用五十八亿二千多万元。张文昂经常考虑的是如何才够“大气”的问题。张文昂到天津去，很仔细地观察天津市各种样式的楼房，他打算吸收各种样式楼房的优点，来修建一所漂亮的楼房。他的宿舍里原来没有暖气设备，竟浪费公款三千多万元按上暖气和锅炉（张和几个司长住一个宿舍，其他司长都没有按暖气）。张文昂并浪费公款一千六百多万元，重新修理假山、修建凉亭和水沟，水沟里面还安装着红绿色的电灯（后因水池漏水又拆掉）。这一切都说明，张文昂已沾染了严重的资产阶级思想。另外，张文昂还私自决定补助工作人员棉衣费共二亿九千六百多万元，补助工作人员烤火费共一亿六千七百多万元。
    现在张文昂已被中央人民政府政务院和中共中央人民政府党委员会分别撤销他办公厅主任和中共交通部党组副书记的职务。交通部节约检查委员会对张的其他问题，仍继续进行检查中。（朱波）
