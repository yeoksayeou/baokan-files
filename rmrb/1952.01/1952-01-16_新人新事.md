    Shaoyang Tannery Successfully Experiments with Pigskin Tanning
    Editor: The state-owned Shaoyang Tannery in Hunan Province successfully experimented with pigskin tanning at the end of October last year. When the factory's employees received the task of pigskin tanning, they were afraid that their technology was not skilled enough, that the masses were not accustomed to skinning pigs, that the raw materials could not be supplied, and that the quality and sales of the pig leather produced would be problematic. After encouragement from superiors, the workers gradually dispelled their concerns and recognized the great significance of pigskin tanning for economic construction. In the trial production process, the workers continuously improved their working methods and overcame many difficulties. For example, pig bristles are deeply rooted in the skin layer and are not easily removed. They mixed lime into a slurry, spread it evenly on both sides of the pigskin, and piled it up for a day, and the pig bristles were pulled out by the roots; if the pigskin was put into a lime pool, a small amount of new lime liquid was added every day, and after eight to ten days, the pig bristles would fall off naturally. Another example is that pigskin is brittle and has low tensile strength, making it easy to break. After research, they realized that this was mainly due to the high fat content in the skin. Therefore, they carefully shaved off the fat attached to the skin, and then soaked it in lime to allow most of the fat to combine with the lime to form calcium fatty acid, and then used alkali to remove the remaining fat. For compounds such as calcium fatty acid remaining in the skin, they adopted the method of soaking it in wheat bran (with water). Pigskin has large pores and the skin surface is not smooth, so they strengthened the calendering effect or added pressure patterns to remedy this. The durability of the pig leather now produced is no less than that of cow leather, and the appearance is also very beautiful, which is fully suitable for making general daily leather products. These achievements have been commended by the Light Industry Bureau of the Industrial Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee and encouraged by the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government.

    An Incident I Encountered on the Train
    Editor: I work in Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province. Recently, on my way to Quzhou for a meeting, I encountered something that moved me deeply.
    The train arrived, and everyone boarded the carriage in an orderly manner. As soon as I sat down, I heard an old woman saying, "This is my first time out, and I don't know the rules." I turned my eyes and saw a railway comrade putting a large box on the wooden shelf of the carriage. "Old lady, you can take it down when you get to the station." The comrade said to the old woman, pointed to the box, and walked away. It turned out that the comrade had helped her bring her luggage onto the train. The train quickly arrived at Quzhou Station. When I picked up my backpack, the old woman's box was already in the hands of a young farmer. The old woman followed behind. The young farmer turned around and said, "We are honest people. We are a family." The words were so simple, yet so touching. When I got off the train, the young farmer was gone, and the old woman was standing there with the box. A comrade from the station ran over from afar and said very kindly, "Old lady, let me help you with your box!" He took the box and helped her out of the station. Although the old woman didn't say anything, she smiled.

    The People's Government Helped Me Cure My Illness
    I am a poor person. I live at No. 12 Chuanban Hutong, District 1, Beijing. I make a living by selling sweet potatoes. In July last year, I contracted kala-azar, which later turned into heart disease. I had shortness of breath, coughing, body swelling, and could not catch my breath. I was very ill, but I had no money to see a doctor. The district people's government knew that I had no money, so they gave me a free certificate and allowed me to go to the Municipal Third Hospital for treatment. Now I have recovered. If it were under the rule of the reactionaries, I would probably be waiting to die. In today's liberated world, everything is taken care of by the people's government. I want to thank the working comrades of the people's government! I want to thank Chairman Mao! From now on, I will work harder to study and produce. I am always ready to respond to all the calls of Chairman Mao and the people's government.

    邵阳制革厂试用猪皮制革成功
    编辑同志：湖南公营邵阳制革厂在去年十月底试用猪皮制革成功。这个厂的职工当接到猪皮制革任务时，害怕自己的技术不熟练，害怕群众没有剥皮的习惯，原料供应不上，害怕制造出来的猪革，质量、销路有问题。经过上级的鼓励，职工们逐渐消除顾虑，认识了猪皮制革在经济建设上的重大意义。在试制过程里，职工们不断改进工作方法，克服了许多困难。比如猪毛根深入皮层，很不容易除去。他们就把石灰调成浆状，匀铺在猪皮两面，堆置一天，猪毛便被连根拔出；如果把猪皮放入灰池，每天加少许新石灰液，经过八天到十天，猪毛就自然脱落了。又如猪皮性脆，抗张力小，很容易破坏。他们研究后，知道这主要是由于皮内含脂肪太多。于是，他们细心地把皮上附着的肥肉削掉，再用石灰浸渍，使所含脂肪大部分和石灰化合而成脂肪酸钙，然后再用碱除去剩余的脂肪。对留存在皮内的脂肪酸钙等化合物，他们则采取了用麦麸（合水）浸渍的办法解决。猪皮毛孔大，皮面很不光滑，他们就加强轧光作用或加压花纹来补救。现在制成的猪革的耐用程度已不差于牛革，外表也很美观，完全适用于制作一般日用皮革制品。这些成就已得到中南军政委员会工业部轻工业管理局的表扬，以及中央人民政府轻工业部的鼓励。

    我在火车上遇见的一件事
    编辑同志：我在浙江省江山县工作。最近，我在赴衢州开会的途中，遇到一件使我很受感动的事。
    火车来了，大家有秩序地走上车厢。我刚坐定，就听到一位老太太在说：“我是头次出门，规矩我是不懂的。”我转过眼，见一个铁路上的同志，正往车厢的木架上放一只大箱子。“老妈妈，到了车站您再拿下来。”那位同志一面对这位老太太说，一面指了一下那只箱子，就走开了。原来，那位同志是帮她拿行李上车来的。火车很快到了衢州站，当我拿起我的背包时，老太太的箱子早被一个年青的农民提在手里。老太太跟在后面。那个年青的农民回过头来说：“我们是老实人。我们是一家人。”话是那么单纯，但又那么动人。等我下了车，那个年青的农民不见了，老太太拿着箱子站在那里。老远跑来了一个车站上的同志，十分和气地说了一声“老妈妈，我帮您拿！”就接过了箱子，扶着她走出车站。老太太虽然没有说什么，可是发出了微笑。

    人民政府帮助我治好了病
    我是一个贫苦人。家住北京市内一区船板胡同十二号。我靠卖白薯维生。去年七月，我害了黑热病，后转为心脏病。每天喘、咳嗽，身体浮肿，上气不接下气，身体不能转动。病很严重，但我没有钱医。区人民政府知道我没有钱，就给了我免费的证明，让我到市立第三医院治疗，现在已经痊愈了。要是在反动派统治的时候，我恐怕只有等着死了。解放了的今天，一切都受到了人民政府的照顾。我要感谢人民政府的工作同志们！我要感谢毛主席！从今以后，我更要努力学习，努力生产。我随时准备着响应毛主席和人民政府的一切号召。
