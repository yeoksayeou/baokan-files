Xinhua News Agency, January 8th: Soviet agriculture achieved significant accomplishments in 1951. According to TASS news agency: The Soviet Union reaped a bumper harvest of grain, sugar beets, cotton, and other agricultural crops last year. Collective farmers supplied industry with 47 million centners (9.4 billion jin) more sugar beets last year than the previous year. Many union republics have overfulfilled their 1951 harvesting and delivery plans. In the Ukrainian Republic, last year's grain harvest exceeded the level of the previous year, and collective farmers delivered 56,928,000 poods (18.6 billion jin) more grain to the state than the previous year; the cotton harvest increased by 15 percent compared to the previous year. The Turkmen Republic has completed 120 percent of its 1951 cotton delivery plan. The harvests of fruits, vegetables, and other agricultural products in Belarus, Tajikistan, and Azerbaijan also increased compared to the previous year.

The scale of agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union has expanded. Last year, Soviet agriculture received 137,000 tractors, 54,000 combine harvesters, and 2 million other agricultural machines. There are now more than 8,600 machine tractor stations nationwide, an increase of nearly 1,700 compared to 1940 before the war. These machine tractor stations completed more than two-thirds of the field work for collective farms last year, almost double the amount before the war; they could do 90 types of work before the war, and now they can do 170 types. Last year, more than 60 percent of all grain fields in the Soviet Union were harvested by combine harvesters. The level of mechanization of agricultural work in some areas is particularly high. For example, machine tractor stations in the Belarusian Republic completed three times as much work for collective farms last year as before the war; 80 to 90 percent of the field work in many collective farms has been completely mechanized.

Soviet farmers have increased yields per unit area by adopting advanced agricultural techniques. Last year, the Stalin Collective Farm in the Chuvash Republic harvested 39 centners of spring wheat per hectare (approximately 520 jin per mu). Collective farmer Dolinyuk in the Ternopol Oblast of Ukraine harvested 221 centners of corn per hectare (approximately 2,946 jin per mu); Sveda, the leader of the work group at the Kuibyshev Collective Farm in the Kyiv Oblast, harvested 935 centners of sugar beets per hectare (approximately 12,466 jin per mu). Now, the lives of Soviet collective farmers are becoming more prosperous year by year. For example, in the Ukrainian Republic, there were 1,500 collective farms with incomes of several million rubles or more last year, triple the number of the previous year. In Tajikistan, many collective farms had incomes of 15 million to 20 million rubles or more last year. In the Moldavian Republic, the public property of all collective farms increased by more than 50 percent last year.

    苏联去年农作物丰收
    农业机械化规模进一步扩大
    【新华社八日讯】苏联农业在一九五一年已获得了重大的成就。据塔斯社消息：去年苏联的谷物、甜菜、棉花和其他农作物都获得了丰收。集体农民去年供给工业的甜菜比前年增加了四千七百万生丁纳（合九十四亿市斤）。许多加盟共和国已超额完成了一九五一年的收割和缴纳计划。在乌克兰共和国，去年的谷物收获量超过了前年的水平，集体农民向国家缴纳的谷物比前年多五千六百九十二万八千普特（合十八亿六千多万市斤）；收获的棉花比前年增加了百分之十五。土库曼共和国已完成了一九五一年收棉计划百分之一百二十。白俄罗斯、塔吉克、阿塞拜疆共和国的水果和菜蔬等农产品的收获量也比前年增加了。
    苏联农业机械化的规模已经扩大。去年苏联农业共得到了十三万七千部拖拉机、五万四千部联合收割机和二百万部其他的农业机器。全国共有八千六百多个机器拖拉机站，比战前一九四○年差不多增加了一千七百个。这些机器拖拉机站去年完成了集体农场三分之二以上的田间工作，差不多相当于战前的两倍；它们在战前可以作九十种工作，现在可以作一百七十种。去年苏联全部谷田有百分之六十以上用联合机收割。某些地区农田工作的机械化水平特别高，例如白俄罗斯共和国的机器拖拉机站，去年在集体农场完成的工作相当于战前的三倍；许多集体农场的田间工作有百分之八十到九十已完全机械化。
    苏联农民由于采用先进的农业技术，已提高了单位面积的产量。去年楚瓦斯共和国斯大林集体农场每公顷收获春小麦三十九生丁纳（约合每市亩收五百二十市斤）。乌克兰特尔诺波尔州集体农民多莉妞克在一公顷的土地上收获玉蜀黍二百二十一生丁纳（约合每市亩收二千九百四十六市斤）；基辅州古比雪夫集体农场工作组组长史薇达每公顷收获甜菜九百三十五生丁纳（约合每市亩收一万二千四百六十六市斤）。现在，苏联集体农民的生活已一年比一年富裕。例如在乌克兰共和国，去年收入在数百万卢布以上的集体农场有一千五百个，相当于前年的三倍。塔吉克共和国去年有许多集体农场收入达一千五百万卢布到二千万卢布以上。摩尔达维亚共和国去年各集体农场的公有财产都增加了百分之五十以上。
