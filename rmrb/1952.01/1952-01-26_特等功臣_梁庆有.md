    "Special Class Hero" Liang Qingyou
    Near the Imjin River, the battle for the upper and lower bunkhouse was in full swing. The Second Squad of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, holding fast to the forward position, had already thwarted five enemy charges. Enraged, the enemy pieced together two more battalions of troops, equipped with five aircraft, twenty-three tanks, and more than seventy large and small cannons, and launched their sixth attack. At this time, only Deputy Squad Leader Liang Qingyou remained on the left flank of the position. He thought: The time has come for the Party and the people to test me, and I must hold the position. Liang Qingyou's spirit was invigorated. In the fifteen-meter-long trench, he shuttled back and forth, left and right, to block the enemy, throwing out more than two hundred grenades in one breath, and repelled three enemy charges. At this time, the bullets were gone, and the grenades were almost exhausted. The cotton coat, soaked with sweat, was torn to shreds by the artillery fire. At this tense moment, the enemy charged up from behind again. He immediately grabbed the only three grenades he had and threw them all at the enemy, and three enemies rolled down the hillside. Liang Qingyou moved to an air-raid shelter. There were six or seven wounded soldiers in the shelter, and they were tearfully anxious that they could not shoot at the enemy. He comforted them and swore to them: "Don't worry, I am a Communist Party member. In order to defend the safety of the motherland and defend world peace, I will fight the enemy to the end." He collected all the ammunition and weapons in the cave and continued to attack the enemy at the entrance of the cave. In this way, he persisted for more than forty minutes, and the enemy began to retreat under the pressure of our army's strong artillery fire. Liang Qingyou immediately jumped out of the cave and chased down the mountain in pursuit of the victory. In this battle, the Second Squad repelled eight enemy charges and killed or wounded more than 260 enemies. Liang Qingyou even more demonstrated the heroic spirit of a Communist Party member, single-handedly holding off the enemy, killing more than 90 enemies, and the position stood firm. Therefore, he won the glorious title of "Special Class Hero." (Attached picture)

    “特等功臣”梁庆有
    临津江附近，上下铺房的战斗正在激烈地进行。固守在前沿阵地的志愿军某部第二班，已经挫败了敌人五次的冲锋。恼羞成怒的敌人，又拚凑了两个营的兵力，配有飞机五架，坦克二十三辆，大小炮七十余门，发动了第六次进攻。这时，阵地的左翼，只剩了副班长梁庆有一人，他想：党和人民考验我的时候到了，我一定要坚守阵地。梁庆有的精神焕发，他在十五公尺长的战沟里，像穿梭一样，左右往返的阻击敌人，一气掷出了二百多枚手榴弹，打退了敌人的三次冲锋。这个时候，子弹打完了，手榴弹也快光了，被汗水湿透了的棉衣，被炮火撕得稀烂。就在这紧张的时刻，敌人又从身后冲上来，他立刻抓起仅有的三颗手榴弹，一齐向敌人掷去，有三个敌人滚下了山坡。梁庆有转移到一个防空洞里，洞里有六七个伤员，他们正为自己不能动手射击敌人，而急的流泪。他安慰他们，并向他们宣誓：“你们放心，我是一个共产党员，为了保卫祖国的安全，保卫世界和平，一定和敌人拚到底。”他搜集了洞里所有的弹药和武器，在洞口继续袭击敌人。这样，一直坚持了四十多分钟，敌人在我军强烈炮火的压力下，开始撤退了。梁庆有立刻跳出洞口，乘胜追下山去。在这次战斗中，第二班共击退敌人八次冲锋，杀伤敌人二百六十余名。梁庆有更表现了共产党员的英雄气概，独挡一面，一个人击毙敌人九十多名，阵地屹立未动；因而荣获了“特等功臣”的光荣称号。（附图片）
