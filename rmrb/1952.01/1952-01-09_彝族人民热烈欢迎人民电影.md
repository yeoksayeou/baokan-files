    Editor: The brilliance of the Central People's Government's ethnic policy shines upon the Liangshan Mountains. This is a place where many ethnic groups live together, with the Yi people being the most numerous. Under reactionary rule, they had always suffered from the oppression of Han chauvinism. The reactionaries also instigated disunity within them. Since liberation, they have realized that the motherland is a warm family. They have established autonomous governments and their own ethnic army—the Zhaojue Yi People's Basic Regiment. The Yi people are leaping forward.
    Watching movies is also part of the new life of the Yi compatriots. They have seen "The Victory of the Chinese People," and recently "The Great Unity of the Chinese Nation" and "Defending the Country and Protecting the Home." People of ethnic minorities in Zhaojue, Yanyuan, Huili, and other places warmly welcome these films, and especially want to see Chairman Mao in the films.
    When Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, they applauded enthusiastically, and it took a long time for it to subside before they continued watching the movie.
    In "The Great Unity of the Chinese Nation," the "Friendship Dance" of the Yi compatriots also appeared, and they were very happy, believing that they had also been liberated in culture. Everyone remembered the bitter days of the past, and vowed to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, defeat the American imperialists, and defend the good days since liberation. Liu Yungge

    彝族人民热烈欢迎人民电影
    编辑同志：中央人民政府民族政策的光辉，照到了千里凉山。这里是民族杂居的地方，居民中最多的是彝民。在反动统治下，他们一直受着大汉族主义的压迫。反动派又唆使他们内部闹不团结。解放以后，他们体会到祖国是个温暖的大家庭，他们建立了自治政府，建立了自己的民族军队——昭觉彝民基干团，彝族人民正在飞跃前进。
    看电影也是彝族同胞的新生活之一。他们看过“中国人民的胜利”，最近又看了“中华民族大团结”和“卫国保家”，昭觉、盐源、会理等地少数民族的人民，热烈欢迎这些电影，尤其想看看影片里的毛主席。
    当毛主席在影片上出现的时候，他们热烈地鼓掌，好久才平息下来，继续看电影。
    在“中华民族大团结”里，彝族同胞的“朋友舞”也出现了，他们高兴得很，认为这是在文化上也翻身了。大家记起了以前的苦日子，发誓一定要支援中国人民志愿军，打败美帝国主义者，保卫解放以来的好日子。刘云阁
