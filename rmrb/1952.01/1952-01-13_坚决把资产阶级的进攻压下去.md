Resolutely Suppress the Bourgeoisie's Attack

The Beijing Municipal Committee for the Economy Campaign launched a massive struggle against bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property within the industrial and commercial sectors, conducting thorough investigations into these illegal activities. On the very first day, they uncovered a massive case involving eight construction companies, including Jingye and Yuxing, colluding to steal over 8 billion yuan in state assets. The primary offenders, Liu Yuanjing and others, have been arrested by public security organs. This marks a victory in our fight against the bourgeoisie's erosion and attack.

Liu Yuanjing and others, in contracting for national defense construction projects, seduced cadres and offered bribes to achieve the sinister goals of cutting corners, underreporting quantities, stealing state assets, and seeking exorbitant profits. This incident clearly demonstrates how serious their rampant attacks against the people and the People's Government have been over the past three years. They not only exhausted every means to steal state assets, but also exhausted every means to corrupt the staff of state organs. On the surface, they used sweet words, almost constantly claiming to serve the people, as if they were willing to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and were willing to sincerely cooperate as "four friends." In reality, they were traitors to the country, traitors to the people, and thieves who stole state assets. In order to greedily seek exorbitant profits, they did not hesitate to damage the country's defense construction. What a despicable and shameful crime!

The People's Government has been lenient towards such lawless merchants who act like thieves, giving them ample opportunity to confess and repent. In the vigorous and thorough anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement, the People's Government has repeatedly called on them to confess, repeatedly explaining the policy of "leniency for those who confess, severe punishment for those who refuse to confess," and repeatedly extending the inspection period. This can be considered the utmost benevolence and righteousness. However, lawless merchants like Liu Yuanjing harbored侥幸, regarding the People's Government's policy as something they could deceive, stubbornly insisting on testing the law and resolutely opposing the people to the end. Can such lawless merchants still be tolerated? After verifying their criminal facts, the Beijing Municipal Committee for the Economy Campaign finally arrested them and brought them to justice. This is a completely correct measure.

Bo Yibo, Director of the Central Economy Campaign Committee, clearly announced in his report on the ninth of this month, "Striving to Universally and Deeply Develop the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement": "All law-breaking industrialists and businessmen should confess to the government within a limited time. A struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence must be launched within the industrial and commercial sectors. It must be known that: bribing state personnel, evading taxes, using various deceptive methods to steal state assets when conducting transactions with the state, cutting corners when undertaking state-entrusted processing, orders, or construction projects, reporting low quality goods as high quality goods, reporting bad goods as good goods, and stealing economic intelligence from state personnel, etc., are all despicable practices left over from the old society, are criminal acts that violate the laws and disciplines of New China, and are absolutely intolerable to the People's Government."

This is the People's Government's policy for handling the illegal activities of all lawless merchants. Now, the Beijing Municipal Committee for the Economy Campaign has taken the lead in implementing this policy, and all localities should also correctly grasp and implement this policy, resolutely striking and punishing all lawless merchants who dare to offer bribes and steal state assets but refuse to confess.

    坚决把资产阶级的进攻压下去
    北京市节约检查委员会在工商界中展开反对行贿、反对漏税、反对盗窃国家资财的巨大斗争，并对这些非法行为进行了大检查。第一天就查出敬业、裕兴等八家营造厂结伙盗窃国家资财八十余亿元的巨案。主犯刘元敬等已由公安机关逮捕归案。这是我们在反对资产阶级侵蚀和进攻的斗争中的一个胜利。
    刘元敬等在承包国防建设工程中，勾引干部，施行贿赂，以达到偷工减料、以少报多、盗骗国家资财、谋取暴利的罪恶目的。这一事件，清楚地说明了他们三年以来向人民和人民政府的猖狂进攻是多么严重。他们不仅想尽一切方法来盗骗国家的资财，而且想尽一切方法来腐蚀国家机关的工作人员。他们在表面上花言巧语，几乎口口声声都是要为人民服务的，好像他们都愿意接受共产党和人民政府的领导，都愿意四个朋友真诚合作的，而实际上，他们却是背弃国家、背弃人民、盗骗国家资财的蟊贼。他们为了贪图暴利，竟不惜损害国家的国防建设，这是多么卑劣可耻的罪行！
    人民政府对待这样行同盗贼的不法商人，曾经宽大为怀，给他们以充分坦白悔过的机会。在大张旗鼓、雷厉风行的反贪污反行贿运动中，人民政府曾一再号召他们坦白，反复说明“坦白者从轻发落、拒不坦白者依法严惩”的方针，并将检查期限一再延展。这可算得是仁至义尽了。可是刘元敬之流的不法商人，却意存侥幸，视人民政府的政策为可欺，硬要以身试法，决心和人民作对到底。对于这样的不法商人，难道还能够再予以容忍吗？北京市节约检查委员会在查明他们的犯罪事实后，终于把他们逮捕法办，这是完全正确的措施。
    中央节约检查委员会主任薄一波本月九日在“为普遍地深入地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动而斗争”的报告中已明白宣布：“一切犯法的工商业者，应当限期向政府坦白。应当在工商界中开展一个反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗窃国家资财、反对偷工减料和反对盗窃国家经济情报的斗争。必须知道：贿赂国家工作人员，偷税漏税，在和国家进行交易时用各种欺骗方法盗窃国家资财，在承受国家委托加工、承受订货或承受修建工程时偷工减料，以贱报贵，以坏作好，以及从国家工作人员手中盗窃经济情报等等，都是旧社会遗留下来的卑劣作风，是违反新中国法纪的罪恶行为，是人民政府所绝对不能容许的。”
    这就是人民政府对于一切不法商人的非法行为的处理方针。现在北京市节约检查委员会首先执行了这个方针，各地也都应该正确地掌握和执行这个方针，对于一切胆敢行贿和盗骗国家资财而拒不坦白的不法商人，予以坚决的打击和惩罚。
