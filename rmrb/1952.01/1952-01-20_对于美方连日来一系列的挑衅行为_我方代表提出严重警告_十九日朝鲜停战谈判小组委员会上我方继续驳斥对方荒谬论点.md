Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 19th: At the sub-committee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 19th, our representative issued a stern warning regarding the series of provocative actions taken by the other side in recent days. Our representative pointed out that when the other side was unable to force our side to accept unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs within the meeting, the other side once again took shameless provocative actions outside the meeting, attempting to threaten our side. In recent days, the other side has bombed the Kaesong neutral zone, bombed prisoner-of-war camps, and carried out provocations against the territory of the People's Republic of China. Yesterday, the other side violated the agreement and bombed and strafed vehicles of our delegation marked as such, traveling between Pyongyang and Kaesong, wounding two staff members of our delegation. Our representative sternly pointed out that such shameless provocative actions by the other side only expose the other side's true face more and more in front of the people of the world, and can never shake our firm and unwavering stance against interference in internal affairs.

    Regarding the absurd arguments repeatedly put forward by the other side regarding maintaining military balance and maintaining a state of war, our representative once again made a detailed refutation. First of all, the other side's so-called claim of maintaining military balance is fundamentally unreasonable, because this claim is actually to maintain a state of war in Korea for a long time and create a tense situation in the world. Our side has always maintained that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea as soon as possible in order to completely eliminate the state of war and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Secondly, the other side's so-called claim of maintaining military balance is actually unworkable and impermissible. Everyone knows that in modern warfare, so-called military capabilities include many factors, involving a very wide range. All cadre training, troop training, improvement of technical equipment, construction of factory facilities, and even the physical training of a country's people are related to military capabilities. Military armistice negotiations cannot fundamentally restrict every factor, because all these factors involve the internal affairs of both sides, and internal affairs are absolutely not allowed to be interfered with. This is also completely unnecessary to ensure the stability of the military armistice. Regarding air force strength, as long as the other side, like our side, truly guarantees that no combat aircraft will enter from outside Korea during the armistice, it is impossible to imagine that there will be any changes in the air force strength of both sides in Korea, and it is even more impossible to pose any threat to the other side. As for the right to handle airport equipment within Korea, it is entirely a matter of internal affairs, and any request to interfere in internal affairs, no matter in what way it is put forward, is absolutely impermissible by our side.

    At the sub-committee meeting on the fourth agenda item, our representative continued to refute the other side's so-called "sworn release" and so-called "voluntary repatriation" principles. After the armistice, the release and repatriation of all prisoners of war should not be subject to any conditions, because the captured personnel on both sides are soldiers of the United Nations forces and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured in combat, and after the armistice, they should naturally be unconditionally released and repatriated according to their military status. The other side's whimsical, unprecedented absurd argument of so-called "voluntary repatriation" is solely for the purpose of detaining our captured personnel and sending them to the Li-Chiang bandit gang, and has no other meaning. Our side will never allow such action to be taken under any pretext.

    对于美方连日来一系列的挑衅行为
    我方代表提出严重警告
    十九日朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会上我方继续驳斥对方荒谬论点
    【新华社开城十九日电】十九日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表对于对方连日来所采取的一系列的挑衅行为提出严重的警告。我方代表指出当对方在会内无法强迫我方接受干涉我方内政的无理要求的时候，对方即再度在会外采取了无耻的挑衅行为，妄图对我方施行威胁。连日来对方对开城中立区施行轰炸，对俘虏营进行轰炸，向中华人民共和国领域进行挑衅。昨日对方更违反协议，对行驶于平壤开城间载有标志的我方代表团车辆进行轰炸与扫射，击伤我代表团工作人员二人。我方代表严词指出，对方这种无耻的挑衅行为，只是在全世界人民面前愈益暴露了对方的真面目，而决不能动摇我方反对干涉内政的坚定不移的立场。
    对于对方重复提出的保持军力平衡、维持战争状态的荒谬论点，我方代表再度进行了详尽的驳斥。首先，对方所谓保持军力平衡的主张，是根本不合理的，因为这一主张实际上就是在朝鲜长期维持战争状态，在全世界制造紧张的局面。我方一贯主张一切外国军队应该迅速撤出朝鲜，以便彻底消除战争状态，和平解决朝鲜问题。其次，对方所谓保持军力平衡的主张，实际上也是行不通和不容许的。谁都知道在现代战争中，所谓军事能力包括许多因素，牵涉极广的范围。凡是干部训练，部队训练，技术装备的改良，工厂设备的修建，甚至于一国人民体力的训练，都与军事能力有关。军事停战的谈判根本不可能限制每一因素，因为所有这些因素都涉及到双方的内政问题，而内政问题是绝对不容许予以干涉的。为了保证军事停战的稳定，这也是完全不必要的。就空军力量说，只要对方和我方一样，确实保证在停战期间不从朝鲜境外进入作战飞机，就不可能设想双方在朝鲜的空军力量会有所变化，更不可能对于对方产生任何威胁。至于处理朝鲜境内机场设备的权利，完全属于内政问题，任何干涉内政的要求，不论在任何方式下提出，都是我方所绝对不能容许的。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续驳斥对方所谓“宣誓释放”，所谓“自愿遣送”的原则。停战后，全体战俘的释放与遣送不应该附带有任何的条件，因为双方被俘人员是联合国军的军人和朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的军人在作战中而被俘的，停战后自然应该无条件地根据他们的军籍进行释放与遣送。对方异想天开，杜撰所谓“自愿遣送”的史无前例的荒谬论点，其目的仅仅是为了扣留我方被俘人员送交李蒋匪帮，别无其他意义。我方决不容许在任何借口之下采取此种行动。
