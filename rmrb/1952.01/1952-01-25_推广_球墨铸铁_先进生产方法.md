Promote Advanced Production Methods for "Ductile Iron"
	Yan Ling

Cast iron is the main raw material used for casting various machine parts, tools, and agricultural implements. It is mainly composed of two elements: iron and carbon. When the carbon content is below approximately 1.2%, it is generally referred to as steel; when the carbon content is above 2%, it is called cast iron (the theoretical dividing line between steel and cast iron is 1.7%). Under certain conditions, some of the carbon in cast iron will be released, and this released carbon is graphite. Therefore, various types of cast iron are iron-carbon alloys based on various types of steel mixed with graphite in various shapes. The physical properties of cast iron are mainly determined by the structure of its base material and the distribution of graphite within it. The role of graphite in cast iron is to give it better casting properties than steel, as well as properties that make it easy to cut and resistant to vibration.

Ordinary cast iron has a high graphite content that is unevenly distributed. Under a microscope, the shape of the graphite inside can be seen as flakes or strips. These graphite flakes and strips make the cast iron very loose and brittle, able to withstand only 15,000 to 30,000 pounds of tensile force per square inch. If the tensile force exceeds 30,000 pounds, it breaks easily and cannot be elongated. At high temperatures, oxidation and cracking can occur along the graphite flakes. Therefore, ordinary cast iron cannot withstand prolonged high heat and strong tensile or expansive forces. To increase the strength of cast iron, the main method is to transform these unevenly distributed and interconnected graphite flakes and strips into evenly distributed, fine-grained graphite clusters. This has been an ideal and a difficult problem for metallurgists and foundry workers for many years.

The first step people took towards this ideal was the creation of "malleable iron" (ductile cast iron) and "high-grade cast iron." The graphite distribution in "malleable iron" is relatively uniform, and it can withstand a tensile force of over 50,000 pounds per square inch. However, casting with it requires long-term annealing, which is very costly, and it can only be used to cast relatively thin and small items. The graphite particles it contains are still relatively large. The graphite in "high-grade cast iron" is distributed in relatively uniform, fine strips, making it easier to cast; however, because the graphite is not in fine spherical form, the tensile force it can withstand still cannot exceed 60,000 pounds per square inch.

In 1948, spheroidal graphite cast iron (referred to as "ductile iron") was first produced by two British individuals. They used a precious rare metal called "cerium" added to the molten cast iron as a contact agent to turn the flake graphite into spheres. This method was not suitable for mass production. From 1950 onwards, the Soviet Union and other countries began to use cheaper magnesium as a contact agent to produce ductile iron on a large scale.

The successful manufacturing of ductile iron is a major event in the world's metallurgical and casting industry. This greatly improves the quality of cast iron: it can withstand a tensile force of approximately 110,000 pounds per square inch and can be elongated. Its tensile strength is about 50,000 pounds greater than that of ordinary steel, and its elongation rate is only about 17% less than that of steel. Because ductile iron has the advantages of high tensile strength and extensibility, it can be used to cast items that ordinary cast iron cannot. Moreover, items that originally required thick ordinary cast iron can now be made with very thin ductile iron, which can save a large amount of pig iron. At the same time, because the equipment for refining ductile iron is not very complex, the cost is relatively low. It allows the technical potential in industry to be greatly exploited, and it has a great effect on the movement for increased production and economy, making it worthy of vigorous promotion.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences, seeing the rapid development of our country's industry and the urgent need for steel that current production equipment cannot meet, considered researching ductile iron to replace some of the cast steel. The Engineering Experiment Hall of the Academy of Sciences began researching ductile iron in July 1950 and successfully produced it for the first time in October of the same year.

When the Engineering Experiment Hall of the Chinese Academy of Sciences experimented with manufacturing ductile iron, the contact agents added to the molten cast iron were of four types: copper-magnesium, nickel-magnesium, silicon-nickel-iron-magnesium, and silicon-iron-magnesium. In the future, for large-scale production of ductile iron in our country, using copper-magnesium alloys or silicon-iron-magnesium alloys as contact agents will be more economical and suitable. Each time, they systematically changed the composition and amount of various magnesium alloys and kept detailed records of the composition of pig iron, iron liquid temperature, magnesium alloy particle size, addition methods, and treatment time. They also conducted detailed chemical analyses and physical property tests on the trial-cast products.

After the successful trial production of ductile iron by the Engineering Experiment Hall of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, many factories in various regions also began trial production. Shanghai Daxin Machine Factory, Tianjin Machine Factory, No. 3 Factory of Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory, Foundry Department of Taiyuan Machine Factory, Fushun Electromechanical Plant, Fuxin Mining Bureau General Machinery Plant, No. 6 Factory of Shenyang Machinery Bureau, Jinan Second Machine Factory, Yunnan Machine Factory, Molding Workshop of Zhejiang Iron Factory, and Beijing Electric Tramway Company Repair and Manufacturing Factory, all began to manufacture this excellent cast iron through close cooperation between engineering technicians and workers and have already applied it to production.

The successful trial production in various factories proves that the liberated Chinese workers and technicians have high intelligence and strong perseverance, and it also demonstrates their love for the motherland. This is not only a technical success but also a political victory, a victory of political leadership over technology.

In mid-February of last year, engineer Sun Yunluan of the East China Industrial Department Daxin Machine Factory said to foundry technician Hu Libao: "We need to cooperate and create a new type of cast iron. Foreign countries have only been successful in making this kind of cast iron in recent years. If we can also make it, it will be of great use!" Hu Libao excitedly said: "It will be such a great contribution to the country; I am willing to do my best to help you complete it. If foreigners can make it, we definitely can too!" With the support of the Party organization and the administrative department, they began to refine copper-magnesium alloys. During the first experiment, Hu Libao disregarded the potential dangers and threw the magnesium into the molten copper furnace, which was spitting out flames more than two feet high. With a "boom," it ignited, and the intense magnesium light illuminated the entire room. The magnesium was not completely thrown into the crucible, and the experiment failed. Engineer Sun Yunluan accepted the lessons of the failure and, after five arduous experiments, changed to using a bent crucible, lowering the solution temperature, lowering the alloy condensation, and avoiding oxidation. Finally, they refined the brilliant white copper-magnesium alloy. After several more trial productions, ductile iron was successfully refined and could be mass-produced.

Taiyuan Machine Factory's trial production of ductile iron was successful only after overcoming the technical worship of American imperialism. Many engineering technicians originally believed the words of American bourgeois engineers, who said, "China's equipment conditions are too poor to adopt the ductile iron method; otherwise, there will be a big fire and a risk of explosion." They were once frightened by this lie and dared not experiment. In May of last year, they tried an experiment, but, fearing that magnesium combustion would cause an accident, they abandoned it halfway. Later, after seeing the news of the successful trial production by Shanghai Daxin Machine Factory, they sent people to Shanghai to study. After returning, technicians, foundry workers, and personnel from relevant departments jointly formed a ductile iron trial production team, constantly fought against the ideology of worshipping America, and boldly researched and experimented. After more than twenty trials, they finally achieved complete success.

The process of Fushun Mining Bureau inviting Professor Wang Zunming of Tsinghua University to guide the trial production of ductile iron at Fushun Electromechanical Plant is also a successful example of combining theory with practice. After arriving at the Electromechanical Plant, Professor Wang Zunming went deep into the workshop and talked to the workers about technical operations. They encountered many difficulties in the trial production process. He combined the scientific theories about ductile iron that he had meticulously researched for two years with the practical operating experience of the workers, constantly summarizing and improving. During the first casting, the cast items had shrinkage cavities. During the second casting, after discussion between the worker-born Deputy Technician Li Debao and experienced technicians, this problem was eliminated. After two months of hard work, they finally succeeded in manufacturing ductile iron. Professor Wang said: "The successful large-scale manufacturing of ductile iron is the result of concentrating the wisdom of the masses. The collectivist spirit of the worker brothers also educated me! In the process of trial production, we summarized our experience at each stage, referred to the existing experience of various countries, applied the knowledge of ductile iron and non-ductile iron, and then put it into practice. In practice, we revised our predictions and found new predictions. We moved forward step by step in this way, opening up a path in practice. — This is also the inspiration that Chairman Mao's 'On Practice' gave us." This trial production work was attended by more than 100 people, including Chief Engineer Xu Yingcen of Fushun Mining Bureau, Chief Engineer Li Jiabin of Electromechanical Plant, Director Chen Enxiang of the iron casting workshop, technicians, and experienced technicians, making it the largest in scale and the most successful in our country. They are now able to cast castings weighing up to 1,200 kilograms. The success of this experiment solved a series of major problems in the production of casting and processing at the Electromechanical Plant, greatly advancing the casting and machinery industries. The Northeast People's Government Industrial Department warmly congratulated them and decided to promote this advanced production method in a planned and step-by-step manner. To this end, they will hold a ductile iron research class and invite Wang Zunming to serve as the main lecturer.

According to the experience of various factories, high-pressure valves, cylinder liners, ingot molds, diesel engine castings, machine tool beds, herringbone gears, and so on, made using the ductile iron method, are of very good quality. Trial production can be done using ordinary factory cupola furnaces, without the need for large steel casting equipment and heat-resistant sand molds. It has good fluidity and can be used to cast objects with complex shapes, and the finished product has a smooth surface. The adoption of ductile iron can solve the difficulty of lacking new materials in our industry. If new-style agricultural implements are manufactured using ductile iron, it can not only reduce costs but also extend service life. Automobiles, trains, ships, motors, textile machine parts, tool machine parts, water pumps, air compressors, etc., all need ductile iron. Ductile iron can not only manufacture many things that ordinary cast iron could not do in the past but can also replace cast steel. In our country, where cast steel equipment is currently less than cast iron equipment, large-scale manufacturing of ductile iron is a huge contribution to national defense construction and economic construction. It has the same hardness as high-manganese steel, its service life is equal to that of high-manganese steel, but the manufacturing cost is half that of high-manganese steel. The cost is also 50% to 60% lower than that of "malleable iron." The cost is only 20% to 30% higher than that of ordinary cast iron, but the product has a service life that is two times longer than that of ordinary cast iron, and some products are even about ten times more durable. In terms of total manufacturing costs, taking just the iron casting workshop of Fushun Electromechanical Plant as an example, it can increase production and save the country 1.45 billion yuan or more in half a year. More importantly, it can accelerate the speed of building the mother of heavy industry—the machinery industry—and therefore the value of the increased production is even more incalculable.

Ductile iron is still a new industrial material in the Soviet Union and other countries, and various countries are still continuing to research and accumulate experience. The theory of forming spherical graphite has attracted the special attention of researchers. In lectures at the Soviet science community and some scientific and technological research conferences, there have been many proposals regarding this issue. However, reasonable theories are still in the embryonic stage. The Engineering Experiment Hall of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has now conducted more than one hundred trial productions and has conducted detailed research on the manufacturing, properties, and control of physical and chemical properties of various magnesium alloys. Although this research work still needs to be strengthened, based on the existing achievements, large-scale promotion is undoubtedly possible. Leading cadres, engineering technicians, and workers in the relevant casting industrial departments in various regions should attach importance to this advanced production method, boldly adopt this production method, and constantly research and improve in large-scale manufacturing, to dedicate all their courage and wisdom to accelerating the industrialization of our motherland!

(Postscript: In order to further promote the manufacturing experience of ductile iron, the Engineering Experiment Hall of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has compiled a book entitled "The Manufacture and Inspection of Ductile Iron" [published by the Compilation Bureau of the Chinese Academy of Sciences], which introduces in detail the smelting methods of various spheroidizing agents, the manufacturing methods of ductile iron, and inspection methods, etc., which will be of great help to the manufacture of ductile iron in various factories and mines in the future.)

    推广“球墨铸铁”先进生产方法
    晏  灵
    铸铁是铸造各种机器零件、工具、农具等所用的主要原料。它主要是由铁碳两种元素组成。其中碳的成分低于百分之一点二左右时，就是一般所说的钢；其中碳的成分高于百分之二时便叫作铸铁（理论上钢和铸铁的分界线是百分之一点七）。铸铁里的碳在某种情况下就会有一部分游离出来；这游离的碳就是石墨。因此，各种铸铁就是以各种不同的钢为基体混合着各种不同形状的石墨的铁碳合金。铸铁的物理性能主要是由它里面的基体的结构和它上面分布的石墨的情形来决定的。铸铁里边的石墨的作用，是使铸铁比钢有较好的浇铸性，而且有便于切削、不怕震动等性能。
    普通的铸铁，石墨含量很多，分布不匀，从显微镜中可以看到，里面的石墨的形状是一片片或一条条的。这些石墨片条使铸铁质地很松很脆，每方吋只能经得起一万五千磅到三万磅的拉力，拉力超过三万磅时一拉就断，而且不能伸长。在高温下，就会沿着石墨片出现氧化、开裂等现象。所以，普通铸铁不能经受长期的高热和强大的拉力、涨力。要想加强铸铁的强度，主要的方法就是把这些分布不均匀、互相联接着的石墨片条加以改造，使它们变成分布均匀的颗粒细小的石墨团。这是冶金工作者和翻砂（浇铸）工作者多年以来的一个理想，一个难题。
    人们向这个理想前进的第一步，是创造了“马铁”（延性铸铁）和“高级铸铁”。“马铁”里面的石墨分布比较均匀了，耐拉力每方吋可以达到五万磅以上。但是，用它铸东西必须经过长期退火，成本很高，而且只能铸造比较薄小的东西。它里面含的石墨块还是比较大的。“高级铸铁”里面的石墨是分布得比较均匀的细小条状，比较容易铸制；但因为石墨还不是细小的球状，耐拉力仍不能超过每方吋六万磅。
    一九四八年，球状石墨铸铁（简称“球墨铸铁”）才由两个英国人开始制成。他们是用一种叫做“铈”的贵重的稀有金属加在熔化了的铸铁里面作为接触剂，使片状石墨变成球状；这是不便大量制造的。从一九五○年起，苏联等国开始利用比较便宜的镁做接触剂，大量生产球墨铸铁。
    球墨铸铁制造成功，是世界上冶铸工业中的重大事件。这样就把铸铁的品质大大地提高了：每方吋可以经受得起十一万磅左右的拉力，而且可以伸长。耐拉力比普通钢要大五万磅左右，伸长率比钢只小百分之十七左右。因为球墨铸铁具有耐拉力大和有伸长性这两个优点，所以能铸造普通铸铁所不能制造的东西；而且原来用很厚的普通铸铁才能制造的东西，现在用很薄的球墨铸铁就能制造了，这就可以节省大量的生铁。同时，因为炼制球墨铸铁的设备并不怎么复杂，成本也就相当低。它使工业上的技术潜力可以大大发挥出来，它对增产节约运动有极大的作用，是值得大力推广的。
              ×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    中国科学院看到我国工业的迅速发展，对于钢材的急迫需要远非目前生产设备所能应付，因此便想到研究球墨铸铁以代替一部分铸钢。科学院工学实验馆从一九五○年七月就开始研究球墨铸铁，同年十月第一次试制成功。
    中国科学院工学实验馆在试验制造球墨铸铁时，加在熔化了的铸铁中的接触剂有铜镁、镍镁、矽镍铁镁、矽铁镁四类。今后我国大量生产球墨铸铁，以用铜镁合金或矽铁镁合金作接触剂较为廉价合用。他们每次试验都有计划地变更各种镁合金的成分和使用量，对于生铁的成分、铁液温度、镁合金粒子大小、加入方法、处理时间等都作了详细的纪录，对试铸成的产品都做了详细的化学分析和物理性质检验。
    中国科学院工学实验馆试制球墨铸铁成功后，各地很多工厂也都开始试制。上海大鑫机器厂、天津机器厂、天津纺织机厂第三工厂、太原机器厂翻砂部、抚顺机电厂、阜新矿务局总机厂、沈阳机械局第六厂、济南第二机器厂、云南机器厂、浙江铁工厂模铸工场、北京市电车公司修造厂，都经过工程技术人员和工人密切合作，开始制造这种优良的铸铁，并且已经应用到生产上去。
    各地工厂试制成功的经过，都证明了解放了的中国工人和技术人员有高度的智慧和坚强的毅力，也表现了他们对祖国的热爱。这不只是技术上的成功，也是政治上的胜利，是政治领导技术取得的胜利。
    去年二月中旬，华东工业部大鑫机器厂工程师孙云鸾对冶铸技工胡礼宝说：“有一件新的铸铁又需要我们大伙合作创造了。这种铸铁在外国是最近几年弄成功的。我们如果也弄成功了，用处大得很！”胡礼宝就兴奋地说：“对国家的贡献这么大，我愿意尽力协助你完成。外国能造，咱们一定也能造成！”在党组织和行政方面的支持下，他们开始炼制铜镁合金。第一次试验时，胡礼宝不顾可能发生的危险，把镁投进吐着二尺多高的火焰的熔铜炉里。“轰”的一声，烧了起来，强烈的镁光照亮了整个房间。镁没有完全投到坩锅里，失败了。孙云鸾工程师接受失败的教训，经过五次艰苦的试验，改用弯头坩锅，降低溶液温度、降低合金冷凝上、避免氧化，终于炼成了白光灿烂的铜镁合金。又经过几次试制，球墨铸铁炼制成功，可以大量制造了。
    太原机器厂试制球墨铸铁，是在克服了技术上崇拜美帝国主义的思想之后才成功的。许多工程技术人员原来听信美国资产阶级工程人员的话，认为“中国设备条件太差，不能采用球墨铸铁法；不然，会闹出大火灾，会有爆炸的危险。”他们曾被这种谎言吓住，不敢试验。去年五月试验了一下，怕镁燃烧引起事故，半途而废了。后来他们看到上海大鑫机器厂试制成功的消息，派人去上海学习，回来后由技术员、翻砂工人和有关部门人员共同组织球墨铸铁试制小组，不断和崇美思想斗争，大胆研究试验，试了二十多次，终于也完全成功了。
    抚顺矿务局邀请清华大学教授王遵明到抚顺机电厂指导试制球墨铸铁的经过，也是理论与实践结合的一个成功的榜样。王遵明教授到机电厂后，就深入车间和工人们谈技术操作。在试制过程中碰到很多困难。他把两年中精心研究的关于球墨铸铁的科学理论和工人的实际操作经验结合起来，不断总结，不断改进。第一次铸造时，铸出的东西有收缩孔，第二次经过工人出身的副技师李德宝和老技工商量，就把这毛病消灭了。经过两个月辛勤的劳动，他们到底也制造成功了。王教授说：“球墨铸铁大量制造成功，是集中了群众的智慧的结果。工人弟兄们的集体主义精神也教育了我！在试做的过程中，每到一定阶段就总结我们的经验，再参照各国已有的经验，运用球墨铸铁的知识和非球墨铸铁的知识，再投入实践。在实践当中对自己的预见有了修正，同时又找到了新的预见。我们就这样一步一步地前进，在实践中打开了一条道路。——这也是毛主席的‘实践论’给我们的启示。”他们这次试制工作，有抚顺矿务局许樱森总工程师、机电厂李家宾主任工程师、铸铁车间主任陈恩相和技术员、老技工等一百多人参加，在我国是规模最大、成就也最大的；他们已能铸制重达一千二百公斤的铸件。这次试验的成功，解决了机电厂铸造、加工等生产上一系列的重大问题，把铸造和机械工业大大向前推进了一步。东北人民政府工业部向他们热烈地致贺，并决定有计划有步骤地推广这种先进生产方法；为此将举办球墨铸铁研究班，聘请王遵明担任主讲教授。
    根据各厂的经验，用球墨铸铁方法造出的高压阀、汽缸套、钢锭模、柴油机铸件、工作母机床面、人字齿轮等等，质量都很好。用普通工厂的化铁炉都可以试作，不需要很大的铸钢设备和耐热的砂模。它的流动性好，可以浇铸形状复杂的东西，成品表面光滑。球墨铸铁的采用，可解决我们工业中缺少新材料的困难。新式农具如果采用球墨铸铁制造，不但可以降低成本，而且可以延长使用寿命。汽车、火车、船舶、电机、纺织机件、工具机件、抽水机、压缩空气机等，都需要球墨铸铁。球墨铸铁不仅可以制造过去普通铸铁不能做的许多东西，而且可以代替铸钢。在我国目前铸钢设备比铸铁设备为少的情况下，大量制造球墨铸铁，对于国防建设和经济建设是一个巨大的贡献。它具有高锰钢同样的硬度，寿命等于高锰钢，制造成本却比高锰钢低二分之一。比“马铁”的成本也低百分之五十到六十。比普通铸铁成本只高百分之二十到三十，而产品比普通铸铁的寿命要长两倍，有的产品甚至要耐用十倍左右。在总的制造成本上，只拿抚顺机电厂铸铁车间来说，半年就可以为国家增产节约十四亿五千万元以上。更重要的是它可以加快重工业之母——机器工业建设的速度，因此而增产的价值更是难以计算的。
            ×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    球墨铸铁在苏联和别的国家也还是一种新的工业材料，各国都还在继续研究，积累经验。形成球状石墨的理论，已引起研究者的特别注意。在苏联科学界和一些科学技术研究会议的讲演中，有不少关于这个问题的提议。但是合理的理论还在萌芽的时期。我国科学院工学实验馆到现在已经试制了一百多次，对于各种镁合金的制造、性能和球墨铸铁物理性、化学性的控制都作了详细的研究。虽然这个研究工作还需要继续加强，但就已有的成就来看，可以大量地推广已是毫无问题的了。各地有关铸造的工业部门的领导干部、工程技术人员和工人，都应该重视这个先进的生产方法，大胆地采用这种生产方法，在大量制造中不断研究，不断改进，为加速我们祖国的工业化，把全部的勇气和智慧拿出来！
    （附记：中国科学院工学实验馆为了进一步推广球墨铸铁的制造经验，编著了“球墨铸铁的制造和检验”一书〔由中国科学院编译局发行〕，详细地介绍了各种球化剂的熔炼方法、球墨铸铁的制造方法和检定方法等，对于今后各厂矿制造球墨铸铁有很大帮助。）
