The Nanchang City People's Court in Jiangxi Province held a sentencing rally on January 6th, sentencing Liu Xiji and Wen Hui, the ringleaders in the Nanchang City Tax Bureau's collective embezzlement case, to death. Over 30,000 people from Party, government, military, and various sectors of the public attended the rally.

Deng Shengyong, President of the Nanchang City People's Court, announced the crimes of Liu Xiji, Wen Hui, and others on behalf of the Central South Branch of the Supreme People's Court. He said: Liu Xiji, Wen Hui, and 58 others, over two years, embezzled amounts equivalent to over 3.92 million catties of rice. Some committed embezzlement over a hundred times, involving bribery of over 280 industrial and commercial households, seriously hindering national fiscal revenue and undermining the prestige of the People's Government. In order to enforce the law strictly, the two principal offenders, Liu Xiji and Wen Hui, were sentenced to death, with permanent deprivation of political rights, and all embezzled funds will be recovered. The remaining offenders were sentenced to imprisonment according to the severity of their crimes. Liu Xiji worked in the Commodity Tax Section, Tax Assessment Group of the Nanchang City Tax Bureau, in charge of tobacco and alcohol tax business. Since January 1950, Liu Xiji colluded with He Qiu and others to evade slaughter tax, used his authority to assess taxes at lower rates, and took the opportunity to extort merchants who were found to be in violation of tax laws, embezzling amounts equivalent to 23,236 catties of rice with other criminals, of which he personally received 18,160 catties. In August 1951, when the City Tax Bureau began the rectification movement, Liu Xiji colluded with He Qiu, Liu Pinghou, Zhu Ruizeng, Wen Hui, and others, holding secret meetings several times at Zhu Ruizeng's home, colluding with each other to persist in their errors, refusing to confess, and sabotaging the rectification movement. After being reported and handed over to the court, he even wrote letters from prison to his wife, Yuan Liqin, asking her to make various efforts, attempting to bribe court staff with 30 to 40 shi of rice to escape legal sanctions. During the successive trials, he stubbornly resisted in every way, downplaying his crimes, firmly refusing to confess, and even daring to make a statement in court, attempting to deceive the People's Government. When this plan failed, he resorted to other sophistries, saying that his embezzlement "was carried out without hindering the principle of national tax revenue," or that it was "borrowed from merchants," or "given by merchants." This proves that Liu Xiji is a thoroughly incorrigible embezzler.

Wen Hui worked as an accountant in the Nanchang City Tax Bureau, and later in the Inspection Section of the Third Branch Bureau. He colluded with field personnel Zhu Guojun, Zhou Xianglin, and others, as well as personnel from the tax assessment and direct tax departments such as He Qiu, to commit embezzlement more than a hundred times, embezzling amounts equivalent to 58,144 catties of rice, of which he personally received 18,486 catties. In order to educate and reform him, the People's Government transferred him to a training class for study in November 1950. While studying, Wen Hui prevented others from exposing their crimes, fabricated materials to deceive the organization, and resolutely fulfilled their promise of "not confessing."

The remaining accomplices were sentenced to imprisonment according to the severity of their crimes and the degree of their confessions.

    南昌市人民法院举行宣判大会
    刘锡骥等集体贪污首犯被判死刑
    江西省南昌市人民法院一月六日举行宣判大会，判处南昌市税务局集体贪污案中的首犯刘锡骥、文辉死刑。到会的有党、政、军及各界人民群众共三万多人。
    南昌市人民法院邓声永院长代表最高人民法院中南分院宣布刘锡骥、文辉罪行。他说：刘锡骥、文辉等六十人，两年中间先后贪污的款额折九二米三十九万斤以上，贪污次数有的竟达百余次，涉及行贿工商业户二百八十余家，严重地妨害了国家财政收入，破坏了人民政府的威信。为严肃法纪，判处刘锡骥、文辉二主犯死刑，褫夺政治权终身，并将全部贪污款项追回。其余各犯根据情节轻重分别判处徒刑。刘锡骥在南昌市税务局货物税科核税组工作，主办烟酒税业务。自一九五○年一月份起，刘锡骥勾结何求等人偷漏屠宰税，利用职权核低税额，乘机勒索被查获的违章漏税商人，总计与其他罪犯共同贪污款额折米二万三千二百三十六斤，他个人实得一万八千一百六十斤。一九五一年八月，市税务局开始整风时，刘锡骥竟与何求、刘屏侯、朱瑞曾、文辉等纠结一起，在朱瑞曾家开秘密会议数次，彼此串通坚持错误，都不坦白，破坏整风运动。被检举移送法院以后，又从狱中写信给他的妻子袁莉琴要她多方活动，妄图以三四十石米的代价向法院工作人员行贿，逃避法律制裁。在历次审讯中，他都百般顽抗，避重就轻，坚不坦白，并敢当庭具结，企图欺骗人民政府。此计未遂，又另外进行诡辩，说他的贪污“是在不妨碍国家税收原则下搞的”，或“向商人借的”，或“商人送的”。这证明了刘锡骥是一个死心蹋地不可救药的贪污分子。
    文辉在南昌市税务局作会计工作，后在三支局的稽查股工作，他勾结外勤人员朱国俊、周祥麟等，及承办核税、直接税各部门工作人员何求等多人，共同进行贪污达一百次以上，贪污款额折米五万八千一百四十四斤，他个人实得一万八千四百八十六斤。人民政府为了教育改造他，在一九五○年十一月间调他到轮训班学习。文辉在学习时竟阻止他人揭发他们的罪行，并捏造材料欺骗组织，坚决地履行他们“都不坦白”的诺言。
    对其余各从犯，都根据犯罪情节轻重和坦白程度分别判处徒刑。
