Reader's Letters

    Severely Punish the Corrupt Elements Like Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan
    To the Editor: The corruption case of Liu Qingshan and others shows that bourgeois ideology has infiltrated the inside of our Party. The whole Party must be vigilant and resolutely wage an irreconcilable struggle against this ideology. Otherwise, there will be a danger of the Party and the country perishing. In addition to agreeing to expel Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party, we also suggest that the government impose severe punishment on them to educate the whole Party and the people of the whole country.

    I Have Also Had Liu Qingshan's Corrupt Ideas, and I Am Determined to Examine and Criticize Myself in the Anti-Corruption Struggle
    To the Editor: I fully support the decision of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to expel Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party. This decision has greatly educated me, making me deeply aware that if a Communist Party member and a revolutionary cadre cannot withstand the temptation of the decadent world, they will degenerate and become traitors to the Party and the people. Thinking back to when I entered the city, I also had shameful ideas similar to Liu Qingshan, thinking that "the revolution has been victorious, and it's time to enjoy life," so I made demands for "treatment" from my superiors and compared myself to others in terms of "splendor." The expulsion of Liu Qingshan and others from the Party has awakened me. I am determined to thoroughly examine myself in this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, correct all mistakes and shortcomings, and strive to maintain the purity of the Party!

    The Communist Party is a Great, Glorious, and Correct Party That Absolutely Does Not Allow Bad Elements to Exist Within It
    To the Editor: The Communist Party's decision to expel Liu Qingshan, the former Secretary of the CPC Tianjin Prefectural Committee, and Zhang Zishan, the current Secretary, from the Party and hand them over to the government for legal action, has further made me realize that the Communist Party is great, glorious, and correct.
    In the past, newspapers have successively published cases of government personnel violating the law and neglecting their duties. Some of these personnel are Communist Party members. Therefore, some people shook their heads and sighed, thinking that "it's really embarrassing for the Communist Party." A few individuals even regarded this individual bad thing as a general phenomenon. I think this view is one-sided. Taking our post office as an example, many Communist Party members have very low salaries (now adjusted), but they bear heavier responsibilities and do more work than others. Their spirit of serving the people is truly touching. The noble qualities of Communist Party members have greatly educated the surrounding masses. This shows that Communist Party members are indeed the leaders of the working people and the vanguard of the working class.

    The Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China
    Should Quickly Investigate the Incident of Wasteful Spending of Huge Sums of Money to Entertain Meeting Participants
    To the Editor: The Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China spent extravagantly and squandered more than 250 million yuan of state funds to entertain the personnel who attended the summary meeting of the General Office Inspection Team held in Kaifeng City from October 24th to November 3rd last year. There were 320 cadres attending the meeting, and there were more than 100 people serving as hospitality staff. In order to "enhance the spectacle," the Henan Branch repainted doors and windows and added furniture and utensils before the meeting; it also distributed bed sheets, porcelain bowls, and glass cups to the participants; during this meeting, more than one million yuan was spent on "cannon tower cigarettes" and more than one thousand kilograms of apples, one thousand six hundred kilograms of bananas, pears, candies, melon seeds, and other fruits.
    After we exposed this wasteful event on December 25th last year, it aroused great attention from the masses. In the past two days, we have received more than 50 letters from people from all walks of life, raising sharp criticisms and pertinent opinions on the intolerable waste of the Henan Branch of the People's Bank. Readers have suggested that the General Office and the General Branch investigate this event. For example, Liu Fenglan, Liu Yong'an, and Yang Junsheng, farmers from the suburbs of Kaifeng City, said in their letters: "...The comrades from the General Office who participated in the meeting encountered this serious extravagance and waste, and instead of criticizing it with the status of representatives of higher-level organs, they happily accepted this hospitality and gifts, which is also wrong and should be examined." Zhi Mingsheng from the Political Department of the Henan Military Region said more explicitly in his letter: "The General Office Inspection Team is also responsible. We suggest that this issue be forwarded to the General Office and let them conduct an examination together."
    We believe that the readers' opinions are correct, and we hope that the relevant leadership will quickly handle this event.

    The Shanxi Provincial Company of the China Construction Enterprise Company
    Leading Cadres Have Serious Bureaucratic Work Style
    To the Editor: The serious bureaucratic work style of some leading cadres of the Shanxi Provincial Company of the China Construction Enterprise Company has caused great losses to state property. The company manager, Shang Fasheng, without investigation and research, appointed Wang Shizhou, a major general department head of Yan Xishan, as the director of the affiliated wood factory, and also thought that he was capable and could make money. After Wang Shizhou became the director, he appointed 23 of his "old colleagues" to work in the factory, occupying leadership positions. This group of corrupt elements then carried out large-scale corruption. For example, foreman Li Shurong falsely reported accounts and cut corners when building the No. 5 Engineering Office of the Transportation Bureau and the company's staff dormitory, embezzling a total of more than 8.4 million yuan. Procurement officer Wang Qinglin colluded with private merchants, privately altered purchase invoices, and embezzled 3,560 kilograms of millet. Procurement officers He Jixin, Wang Huancheng, and others colluded with private merchants to forge contracts and accepted bribes from private merchants, embezzling a total of more than 9.6 million yuan. More seriously, these people secretly informed private merchants of the state's timber market situation, allowing private merchants to speculate and seek exorbitant profits. Liang Zhenlu, the deputy director of the wood factory, as a Communist Party member, not only did not resolutely oppose these corrupt acts, but instead colluded with them. Company manager Shang Fasheng's bureaucratic work style is very serious. For a year, he did not conduct in-depth investigation and research. Knowing about Wang Qinglin's corrupt acts, he transferred him to work in the Changzhi branch. Gang leader Liu Xing colluded with other gang leaders to embezzle and waste 31 million yuan in the construction of the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle School project. Liu gave Shang Fasheng a watch for this matter, and Shang accepted it without asking any questions. Shang Fasheng said: "As long as you can make money, it's better than anything." After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched, he still did not listen to the suggestions of the staff. This serious bureaucratic work style has reached an intolerable level, and I believe that the relevant departments should quickly investigate.

    The Beijing Industrial Equipment Company
    Leading Cadres' Serious Bureaucratic Work Style Caused Twenty-Seven Car Radiators to Freeze
    To the Editor: Leading cadres of the Beijing Industrial Equipment Company have a serious bureaucratic work style, coupled with poor management and failure to learn business, resulting in huge losses to state property. On November 21, 1951, it was reported that the temperature would drop, and the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce notified the Industrial Equipment Company to pay attention to inspecting the new warehouse to prevent damage to goods from freezing. Company manager Li Yueceng sent two deputy section chiefs, Ma Jingwen and Gu Jingrui, to inspect, but they just took a cursory look and were irresponsible, failing to drain the water from the radiators of the 27 cars in storage. When the company's technicians asked Gu Jingrui the next day whether to drain the water, Gu Jingrui said: "It's already frozen, let's talk about it tomorrow!" As a result, the outer casings of the 27 car radiators were all frozen and damaged, and the repair costs alone amounted to 26 million yuan. More seriously, when the warehouse manager called to report that the car radiators were frozen and damaged, Gu Jingrui was still calmly playing chess, as if nothing had happened. Now the company's manager has made a review of this matter and requested punishment. The Municipal Finance and Economics Committee and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce are sending people to investigate and deal with it. All relevant departments should learn from this lesson and pay attention to protecting state property.

    The Beijing Industrial Equipment Company
    Should Not Leave New Cars in the Open Air to Be Exposed to the Wind and Rain
    To the Editor: On December 5th last year, I went to the East Suburb Vehicle Storage of the Beijing Industrial Equipment Company to look at cars in order to purchase a car. I found that seven brand-new small cars were parked uncovered in the square, exposed to the sun and rain. After our inspection: the cylinders of two Soviet Victory cars were already cracked from freezing; the paint of two ZIM cars had cracked, and one of them was also missing the original battery. I think it is true that the new car depot has not yet been built, but if cloth covers or straw mats are used to cover them, or a temporary shed is built, the cars can be protected from or less damaged. The chief of the business section of this company said: "I haven't been to see them since this batch of cars was placed in the East Suburb." This irresponsible attitude towards state property is wrong, and the leading cadres of this company should quickly dispose of this batch of cars.

    The Marriage Law Saved Me
    Two years ago, I was still living like a beast of burden in the dark old society. I will never forget 1944. That year, the Japanese invaders occupied Hunan and Guangxi, and our family fled to Guiyang. My father worked as a clerk in a puppet organization, shouldering the burden of supporting a family of five. He died of illness due to overwork. Under the pressure of life, I, at the age of fourteen, became a maidservant in the home of a puppet military officer, working hard and living a hard life, having to work from five o'clock in the morning to twelve o'clock at night every day. I worked hard for them. But they thought I was too young and didn't give me a penny. Then they forced me to marry their "young master." That "young master" was sick and dying, and his family wanted to use me to "ward off bad luck" and cure the "young master's" illness. So I became the wife of a dying person. My life was controlled by them. They said: "A woman is a pen. You pick it up when you use it, and you put it down when you don't. You can't rebel even if you want to." Soon, my husband's rheumatism turned into leprosy, which could no longer be cured. I thought, "It's better to die than to suffer alive." Therefore, in August 1948, I secretly drowned myself in a lake, but was rescued and lived a life like a beast of burden again.
    Last year, the new Marriage Law was promulgated. The People's Government made a fair and reasonable handling of my marriage problem, and I finally divorced. I am happy, I am ecstatic! Since then, I have joined the warm and harmonious big family - the People's Liberation Army, and I have changed from the status of a slave to the master of the new China. I no longer worry about my life and personal future.
    I thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for rescuing me from the fire pit. Now I want to actively publicize to the women around me who are bound by the feudal marriage system and strengthen the struggle against the feudal marriage system.
                Yao Ping, Second Team of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    严惩刘青山张子善等贪污分子
    编辑同志：刘青山等的贪污事件，说明了资产阶级的思想，已经侵袭到我们党的内部。全党必须引起警惕，坚决地和这种思想进行不调和的斗争。否则就有亡党、亡国的危险。我们除同意开除刘青山、张子善二人党籍外，并建议政府要予以严厉惩处，以教育全党和全国人民。

    我也有过刘青山的腐化思想在反贪污斗争中决检查批判
    编辑同志：我完全拥护中共河北省委员会关于开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决议。这个决议对我的教育作用很大，使我深刻地认识到作为一个共产党员、一个革命干部，如果经不起花花世界的引诱，就会堕落腐化，变为党和人民的叛徒。回想我入城以来，也曾有过和刘青山相似的可耻思想，认为“革命胜利了，该享受享受了”，于是和上级闹“待遇”，和别人比“阔气”。刘青山等被开除党籍的事件，使我猛醒过来。我决心在这次反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中，深刻地检查自己，改正一切错误和缺点，为保持党的纯洁性而奋斗！

    共产党是伟大光荣正确的党内绝不容许坏分子存在
    编辑同志：共产党决定开除前中共天津地委书记刘青山和现任书记张子善的党籍，并送交政府法办，这件事情，更使我认识到共产党是伟大的、光荣的、正确的。
    过去报上陆续发表了一些政府工作人员违法渎职的案件，这些工作人员中，有的是共产党员。因此，有人摇头叹气，认为“真给共产党丢人”。个别人甚至把这种个别的坏事，当成一般的现象。我认为这种看法是片面的。就以我们邮局的情形来说，有许多共产党员的待遇很低（现在调整了工资），但负的责任比别人重，作的工作比别人多。他们那种为人民服务的精神，实在使人感动。共产党员的这种高贵品质，大大教育了周围的群众。这说明共产党员确是劳动人民的领导者，工人阶级的先锋队。        陈步湘
    中国人民银行河南省分行
    应速检查浪费巨款招待开会人员的事件
    编辑同志：中国人民银行河南省分行为了招待去年十月二十四日到十一月三日在开封市举行的总行视察团总结大会的人员，大肆铺张浪费，挥霍了国家资财二亿五千多万元。出席这次会议的干部有三百二十人，而会议所用的招待人员竟有一百多人。为了“壮观瞻”，河南省分行在会议之前，曾经粉刷门窗，添置家具什物；还给参加会议的人发了被单、磁碗、玻璃杯；在这个会议中，用了一百多万元的“炮台烟”和一千多斤苹果、一千六百多斤香蕉、梨、糖、瓜子等果品。
    我们在去年十二月二十五日揭发了这一浪费事件后，引起了群众的极大注意，两天以来，我们收到了各界人民的来信五十多件，对人民银行河南省分行这一不能容忍的浪费事件，提出了尖锐的批评和中肯的意见。读者纷纷建议总行和总分行检查这一事件。如开封市郊区农民刘凤兰、刘永安、杨俊生的来信中就这样说：“……参加会议的总行同志遇到这种严重的铺张浪费行为，不以上级机关代表的资格予以批评，反而高兴地接受这种招待和赠送，同样是错误的，也要检讨才是。”河南军区政治部志明生在来信中更明确地说：“总行视察团也是有责任的，我们建议把这一问题转达总行，让他们一并进行检查。”
    我们认为读者的意见是正确的，希望有关领导方面迅速处理这一事件。        河南日报总编室
    中国建筑企业公司山西省公司
    领导干部官僚主义作风严重
    编辑同志：中国建筑企业公司山西省公司某些领导干部的严重的官僚主义作风，造成国家财产的很大损失。公司经理尚发生没有调查研究，就任用阎匪锡山的少将处长王时洲担任所属木厂厂长，还认为他能干，会赚钱。王时洲当了厂长后，任用了他的“老同事”二十三人进厂做事，霸占了领导地位。这批腐化分子从此大肆贪污。比如领工员李树荣在修建交通局五处工程和这个公司的职工宿舍时，曾虚报账目、偷工减料，共贪污了八百四十多万元。采购员王庆麟勾结私商，私自涂改购货发票，贪污了三千五百六十斤小米。采购员何季新、王焕成等勾结私商伪造合同，并接受私商的贿赂等，共贪污了九百六十多万元。更严重的是这些人把国家木材商情密告私商，使私商投机倒把、牟取暴利。木厂副厂长梁振禄身为共产党员，不但不坚决反对这些贪污行为，反而同流合污。公司经理尚发生的官僚主义作风很严重，一年来不深入调查研究，知道了王庆麟的贪污行为，却把他调到长治分公司工作。把头刘兴曾勾结其他把头，在修建工农速成中学工程中，贪污和浪费了三千一百万元。刘为这件事送了尚发生一只手表，尚毫不过问就收下了。尚发生说：“只要可以赚钱比啥都强。”在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开后，他还不听职工的建议。这种严重的官僚主义作风，已经到了不能容忍的程度，我认为有关部门应迅速检查。        白水
    北京市工业器材公司
    领导干部官僚主义作风严重使二十七辆汽车水箱被冻坏
    编辑同志：北京市工业器材公司领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，加以不善于经营、不学习业务，致使国家资财遭受巨大损失。一九五一年十一月二十一日，报载气温将要下降，市工商局就通知工业器材公司，注意检查新建仓库，防止冻坏商品。公司经理李越曾派马景文、顾景瑞两副科长去检查，但他俩只是走马观花，不负责任，没有把库存二十七辆汽车水箱内的水放完。当第二天公司的技术人员请示顾景瑞是否要去放水时，顾景瑞说：“冻还不是冻了，明天再说吧！”结果，二十七辆汽车的水箱外套全部冻坏，只修理费就花了二千六百万元。更严重的是当仓库管理员打电话报告汽车水箱被冻坏时，顾景瑞还安然下棋，若无其事。现在这个公司的经理对这件事已经作了检讨，并请求处分。市财政经济委员会及工商局正派人检查处理。各有关部门应该吸取这个教训，注意保护国家资财。

    北京市工业器材公司
    不应把新汽车放在露天地里任风吹雨淋
    编辑同志：去年十二月五日，我为了购置汽车，到北京市工业器材公司东郊存车库看车。我发现有七辆崭新的小座车无遮无盖地停在广场上，任凭日晒雨淋。经我们检查：两辆苏联胜利牌汽车的汽缸已冻裂了；两辆吉姆牌汽车，油漆都发生了裂纹，其中一辆还丢失了原配的电瓶。我认为这里的新车库尚未盖好，固是事实，但如用布套或草席加以遮盖，或搭个临时草棚，也可以使汽车不受或少受损失。这个公司业务科科长说：“自从这批车放到东郊后，我还没有去看过。”这种对国家资财不负责任的态度是不对的，这个公司领导干部应迅速处置这批汽车。    林丁
    婚姻法拯救了我
    两年以前我还在黑暗的旧社会中过着像牛马一样的生活。我永远不能忘记的是一九四四年。那年日寇侵占了湖南广西一带，我们一家逃难到贵阳。我父亲在一个伪机关当职员，担负着养活全家五口人的重担，因劳致病，死去了。在生活的压迫下，十四岁的我，便在一家伪军官家里当女仆人，工作繁重，生活艰苦，每天要从早上五点钟忙到晚上十二点。我拼着命给他们干活。但是他们嫌我小，不给我一个钱。接着又强迫我和他家“少爷”成婚。那个“少爷”有病快死了，他家想用我“冲喜”，治好“少爷”的病。于是我便成了快要死的人的妻子。我的生命操纵在他们手里。他们说：“女人是一支笔，用的时候拿起来，不用的时候就搁起，你想造反也反不了。”不久，我的丈夫又由风湿病转成麻疯病，是不能再治好了。我想“死了要比活着受罪好些”。因此，我在一九四八年八月，偷偷地投湖自杀，但被人救出，重又过着牛马样的生活。
    去年，新婚姻法颁布了。人民政府对我的婚姻问题作了公正合理的处理，我终于离婚了。我高兴，我狂欢！从此我投入了温暖和睦的大家庭——解放军，我从奴隶的地位一变而为新中国的主人。我不再为生活和个人前途忧愁了。
    我感谢共产党、毛主席把我救出火坑。现在我要积极向我周围受封建婚姻制度束缚的妇女宣传，加强对封建婚姻制度的斗争。
