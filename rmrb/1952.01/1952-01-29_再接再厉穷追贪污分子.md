The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has truly transformed into a mass movement of the entire nation. In the past month, all levels of Party, government, military, and civilian organs in various regions, particularly all central-level organs, have been involved in this great struggle without exception. Under the guidance of earnestly implementing the principle of leaders taking the lead and conducting reviews at each level, the masses have been widely mobilized. Many people who were usually timid have become courageous; many leading cadres have received significant education from the democratic criticism and self-criticism of the masses; and the vast majority of cadres and the masses have generally heightened their vigilance against the erosion of bourgeois ideology. This struggle has not only played an important role in democratic reform within the organs and achieved a huge effect of changing customs in society, but it has also directly forced a large number of large, medium, and small corrupt elements within the organs and illegal elements in the industrial and commercial circles to confess voluntarily or be exposed by others.

However, we must not be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. Before the Spring Festival, up to January 25th, although the central-level organs had already captured sixty major embezzlers who had embezzled over 100 million yuan, and quickly discovered another batch of major embezzlers, countless materials prove that there are still many major embezzlers who have not been caught. The situation at the central level is like this, and the situation in other places will be no exception. All views that are complacent and believe that the anti-corruption struggle is almost over are groundless and extremely wrong. It must be pointed out that no matter which system or organ, whether it is the Party, government, military, or civilian, as long as it is in charge of large amounts of money and materials, there must be a large number of corrupt elements. It is unreliable and should not be believed if it is said that there is only serious bureaucracy and no corruption and waste, or that there is only serious waste and no corruption or very little corruption. At the same time, it must also be pointed out that some people think that they do not manage large amounts of money and materials and do not have much power, so they are a "clean department" and there is no possibility of corruption. This is also wrong. Facts have proved that as long as there is contact and dealings with the bourgeoisie, there is a possibility and way for corruption. Any perfunctory inspection work will not be effective. All units that have not effectively exposed and solved problems must start from scratch, mobilize all forces, and investigate all major, medium, and small corrupt elements. Find as many as there are, and in particular, concentrate firepower and thoroughly pursue and arrest major embezzlers. After the Spring Festival, the central-level organs must concentrate all their efforts and continue to fiercely besiege the major embezzlers, taking advantage of the victory to pursue them, capturing them all and bringing them to justice, without letting one escape, and not stopping until the goal is achieved.

At present, there are many favorable conditions for continuing to besiege and pursue major embezzlers. First, the vast majority of the masses are generally fully mobilized, and generally there are upright cadres with experience in fighting corrupt elements as the backbone. The development of the movement generally has no major deviations, and the mood of the masses continues to rise. They are exposing corrupt elements everywhere. The masses are constantly and enthusiastically demanding the convening of struggle meetings and public trials against corrupt elements. These meetings put great pressure on corrupt elements. Second, many corrupt elements have voluntarily confessed, explaining their own problems and the problems of others they know, and actively participating in the struggle, asking to atone for their crimes with merit. This makes the major embezzlers who refuse to confess even more isolated. Third, the reporting movement of workers and shop assistants and the confession movement of the industrial and commercial circles are gradually deepening. The materials they provide are constantly increasing. When these materials are combined with the materials within the organs, the major embezzlers are attacked from both inside and outside and have nowhere to hide. Fourth, after a month of fierce struggle, the masses have grasped the situation and found the laws on how corrupt elements engage in corruption, how capitalists engage in bribery, where major embezzlers are hiding, and what methods, types, and ways there are for corruption and bribery. In short, the current anti-corruption struggle, especially the struggle against major embezzlers, has many favorable conditions, especially the vast mass forces to rely on. This team is powerful and forms a dragnet, and no matter how cunning the major embezzlers are, they cannot escape.

The key is that we must be good at relying on the masses and good at using all favorable conditions. The above conditions have just been formed, and we must make these conditions more mature in order to better use them. This requires the leaders at all levels who lead the struggle to further mobilize and rely on the masses. After the leading cadres at all levels have made in-depth reviews on major issues (this is a necessary and indispensable part of the work), they should shift the main strength of the leadership and the masses to the struggle of fiercely attacking major embezzlers. In places where leading cadres have not yet made in-depth reviews, they should conduct reviews at an appropriate time, but this should not delay the attack on major embezzlers. If any level of cadres cannot solve the corruption problem themselves, their superiors should immediately send inspection teams to supervise and investigate, and must thoroughly investigate all corrupt elements, especially major embezzlers. It must be recognized that major embezzlers, like heinous counter-revolutionaries, will not bow their heads and admit their guilt if the broad masses are not mobilized to wage a resolute struggle against them. The cadres who lead the struggle at all levels must have an unwavering determination, and educate the masses to also hold the greatest determination, and to "eliminate evil completely" against major embezzlers, without any wavering. Major embezzlers are "big tigers" that devour the wealth of the people and the country. If they are not completely eliminated in this struggle, and they temporarily hide during the high tide of the movement, then they will continue to harm after the wind blows. Anyone who pities them with a "compassionate heart" is holding a cruel and unkind heart towards the construction of the people's country. Is this what the patriotic and revolutionary people want?

Some people also feel that it is not glorious to have discovered a group of major embezzlers in their own organs. Of course, it is not glorious to allow corruption to exist, but it is glorious to find out the corrupt elements and eliminate corruption. In the past, these corrupt elements were hidden in the organs and were not exposed, which was enough to show that the leading cadres of the organs had bureaucratic errors, but if they are not completely eliminated now, then the bureaucratic errors of these leading cadres will be unforgivable. In order to completely eliminate these pests, one should not be afraid that catching too many pests is not glorious to oneself; on the contrary, as long as one is determined now to completely eliminate all those pests, it is still worthy of praise. If there are still corrupt elements in one's own organ, and the exposure and capture is not thorough or clean, they will always be investigated, and the person in charge of the organ must be subject to increased blame or punishment, and cannot be forgiven.

The anti-corruption struggle is closely inseparable from the struggle against waste and bureaucracy; but at present, the firepower of the struggle must be concentrated on anti-corruption, especially to launch a fierce attack on major embezzlers, besieging and capturing them from all directions. Wherever major clues of corruption or very serious phenomena of waste are found, corruption must be pursued in order to achieve the goal of resolutely, completely, cleanly, and thoroughly eliminating all corruption phenomena. We want to let this scourge and poison that the old society left behind be forever extinct through the struggle of our generation of revolutionary people!

### 再接再厉穷追贪污分子

    再接再厉穷追贪污分子
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，已经真正变成为全国人民的群众运动。近一个月来，各地党、政、军、民的各级机关，特别是中央一级所有的机关都无例外地投入了这个伟大的斗争。在认真实行首长带头、层层检讨的方针之下，群众普遍地发动起来，许多平日表现很懦弱的人也勇敢起来了；许多领导干部从群众的民主批评和自我批评中，受到了重大的教育；广大的干部和群众对于资产阶级思想的侵蚀，普遍提高了警惕。这个斗争，不但在机关内部起了民主改革的重要作用，在社会上收到移风易俗的巨大效果，而且直接迫使机关内部的大、中、小贪污分子和工商界的不法分子，大批地自动坦白或被人检举出来了。
    但是，我们决不能满足于已有的成绩。在春节以前，截至本月二十五日，中央一级的各机关虽然已经捕捉了贪污一亿元以上的大贪污犯六十名，并且很快又发现了一批大贪污犯；但是，无数的材料证明，还有许多大贪污犯仍然没有落网。中央一级的情形是这样，其他各地的情形也不会例外。一切麻痹自满地以为反贪污斗争已经差不多可以结束的观点，是毫无根据和极端错误的。必须指出：无论党、政、军、民那一个系统，那一个机关，只要是大批地掌管钱财物资的，就一定有大批的贪污犯。凡说那里只有严重的官僚主义而没有贪污浪费，或说只有严重的浪费而没有贪污或贪污极少的，一定不可靠，一定不要相信。同时，也必须指出：有些人认为他那里既不掌管大批钱财物资，又无多大权力，是“清水衙门”，没有什么贪污的可能，这也是错误的。事实证明，只要和资产阶级有连系、有来往，就有贪污的可能和道路。一切不痛不痒的检查工作是决不能收效的。一切没有切实暴露问题和解决问题的单位，必须从头做起，动员一切力量，追查一切大、中、小贪污犯。有多少就要查出多少来，特别是要集中火力，彻底追捕大贪污犯。中央一级各机关，在春节以后，更要集中所有一切力量，再接再厉地向大贪污犯展开猛烈的围攻，务必乘胜穷追，把他们全部捕捉归案，不使他们有一个漏网，不达目的，决不停止。
    目前继续围攻和穷追大贪污犯，有许多便利条件已经形成。第一，广大群众一般地是充分发动起来了，并且一般地都有正派的和对贪污分子斗争有经验的干部作骨干。运动的发展一般地没有什么大的偏向，群众情绪正在继续高涨。他们到处检举贪污分子。群众不断热烈要求召开对贪污分子的斗争大会和公审大会。这些大会给贪污分子很大的压力。第二，许多贪污分子自动坦白，纷纷把他们自己的问题和他们所知道的别人的问题，交代清楚，并且积极参加到斗争中来，要求戴罪立功。这就使拒不坦白的大贪污犯更加陷于孤立。第三，工人、店员的检举运动和工商界的坦白运动正逐渐深入开展。他们所提供的材料不断增加。这些材料和机关内部的材料结合起来，就使大贪污犯遭受内外的夹攻，无处躲藏。第四，经过一个月的激烈的斗争之后，群众对贪污分子如何进行贪污，资本家如何进行贿赂，大贪污分子隐藏在什么地方，贪污和行贿有那些方法、种类和门路，已经掌握情况找到规律，心中有数。总之，目前反贪污的斗争，特别是对大贪污犯进攻的斗争是有许多便利条件的，特别是有广大的群众队伍可以依靠。这个队伍声势浩大，布成了天罗地网，任凭什么诡计多端的大贪污犯也是插翅难逃。
    问题的关键还在于我们要善于依靠群众，善于运用一切有利的条件。上述各项条件目前刚刚形成，我们还必须使这些条件更加成熟，才能更好地加以运用。这就要求领导斗争的各级负责人，进一步发动群众和依靠群众。各级领导干部在主要问题上做了深刻检讨（这是必须做的必不可少的一段工作）之后，应把领导和群众的主要力量转到对于大贪污犯猛烈进攻的斗争中去。在领导干部还没有做深刻检讨的地方，应在适当时机补行检讨，但不能因此拖延对于大贪污犯的进攻。如有那一级干部自己不能解决贪污问题，他的上级应即派遣检查组下去督促追查，务必把一切贪污分子特别是大贪污犯彻底追查出来。必须认识：大贪污犯和罪大恶极的反革命分子一样，如果不发动广大群众向他们进行坚决的斗争，他们是不会低头认罪的。各级领导斗争的干部都必须具有坚定不移的决心，并教育群众同样抱定最大的决心，对于大贪污犯要“除恶务尽”，不可有任何动摇。大贪污犯是吞噬人民国家财富的“大老虎”。如果在这次斗争中不彻底打尽他们，让他们在运动的高潮中暂时躲避起来，那末，一阵风过后，他们又会继续为害。谁要是以“恻隐之心”怜悯了他们，就是对于人民国家的建设事业抱着残忍不仁的心肠。这难道是爱国的革命的人民所愿意的吗？
    也有许人觉得从自己的机关中发现了一批大贪污犯，这是不光荣的。当然，让贪污存在是不光荣的，但是找出了贪污犯，消灭了贪污，却是光荣的工作。过去这些贪污犯隐藏在机关中没有被揭发，虽然足以说明机关的领导干部有官僚主义的错误，但是，现在如果还不彻底清除他们，那么，这些领导干部的官僚主义错误就将不可饶恕了。为了彻底清除这些害虫，就不应该怕捉到害虫太多对自己不光荣；相反的，只要现在有决心，彻底地把那许多害虫全部清除干净，仍然是值得表扬的。如果自己的机关中还有贪污分子，而揭发和捕捉得不彻底、不干净的，总有一天要被追查出来，到那时，机关的负责人必须受到加重的责备或处分，决不能被宽恕。
    反贪污是和反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争密切不可分的；但在目前斗争的火力必须集中于反贪污，特别是要对大贪污犯展开猛烈的进攻，从四面八方加以围困与捕捉。凡发现重大贪污线索或浪费现象十分严重的地方，都必须穷追贪污，以达到坚决、全部、干净、彻底地消灭一切贪污现象的目的。我们要让旧社会遗留下来的这个祸国殃民的污毒，经过我们这一代革命人民的斗争而永远绝迹！
