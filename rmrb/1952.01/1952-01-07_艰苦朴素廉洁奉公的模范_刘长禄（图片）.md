    Written by Ren Qianqiao, Sun Hanchun, Zhao Wenwei, Gong Mei, Chen Qi, Peng Bin
    (X) In order to save on transportation costs, he once walked thirty *li* to find four trucking companies, and as a result, he selected the one with the cheapest rates, renting twenty trucks, which saved 120,000 yuan per truck, thus saving the public 2.4 million yuan in transportation costs. He also saved a lot of money in other work.
    (XI) Liu Changlu was not only able to maintain a style of hard work and simplicity himself, but he could also often pay attention to educating and influencing others. When some comrades had unclear points when they were submitting expense accounts, he would promptly raise them for discussion and resolution.
    (XII) Liu Changlu has been awarded the Fourth Class Merit twice, the Third Class Merit twice, and was once selected as a model. His model deeds are recognized by the masses. Last July, he was again selected as a model of frugality at the Public Security Cadre School and attended the Hero and Model Representative Conference of the East China Military Region Public Security Forces. Liu Changlu has these advantages and achievements, but he is not satisfied. He said, "My achievements are the result of the Party's nurturing, and should first of all be attributed to the Party. I still have many shortcomings. In the future, I will strengthen my studies, continue to improve myself, and strive for higher honors under the leadership of the Party." (The End)

    （十）为了节省运费，他曾步行三十里找了四个汽车运输行，结果选了一家最廉价的，租赁了二十辆汽车，每辆便宜十二万元，这样就为公家节省运费二百四十万元。在其他项工作中也节约了很多钱。
    （十一）刘长禄不仅自身能够处处保持艰苦朴素的作风，而且能经常注意教育和影响别人。碰到有的同志在报销款项时，有什么不明确的地方，他就及时提出研究，求得解决。
    （十二）刘长禄曾经立过两次四等功，两次三等功，并有一次被选为模范。他的模范事迹，是群众所公认的。去年七月又被选为公安干部学校节约模范，并出席了华东军区公安部队英雄模范代表大会。刘长禄有这些优点和功绩，但是他并不满足，他说：“成绩是党培养我的结果，应当首先归功于党。我的缺点还很多，今后要加强学习，继续提高自己，在党的领导下，争取更高的荣誉。”（完）
