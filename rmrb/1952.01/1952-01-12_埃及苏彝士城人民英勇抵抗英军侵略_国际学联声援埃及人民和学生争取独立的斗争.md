    国际学联声援埃及人民和学生争取独立的斗争
    【新华社八日讯】埃及人民奋起抵抗英国占领军在苏彝士运河区采取新的侵略行动。据塔斯社开罗五日讯：“埃及人报”写道，英军装甲车在三日冲进苏彝士附近的禁区，并向埃及人开枪。该报指出，这个区域内的居民包括妇女和儿童都进行抵抗。被调到出事地点的埃及警察部队不得不和英军作战。据报纸消息说，二十二名英国人被击毙，四十名受伤。十八个埃及人受伤，其中两个是儿童。“金字塔报”说：“两辆战车和两辆装甲车被焚毁，战车和装甲车上的人员也被烧死。”英军一千八百人参加了这次冲突。
    “金字塔报”的另一则消息说：英军增援了二十辆战车以及装甲车和重炮，在四日再度进攻苏彝士。英军包围了住满病人的政府医院，并向这个医院开枪。该报又称：晚上，英军包围了城市，摧毁了三栋房屋，并破坏了其他的一些房屋。

    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社布拉格八日讯：国际学生联合会书记处顷致电埃及学生，电文如下：
    国际学生联合会书记处以深切的同情注视着日益发展的埃及学生运动以及他们为民族与国家的独立而进行的斗争。全世界学生都知道，埃及学生不顾他们的示威运动所遭受的禁止和破坏，而继续进行着英勇的斗争。禁止和驱散学生示威游行，使埃及人民的民族解放斗争遭到了很大的损失。
    国际学生联合会书记处代表七十一个国家的五百多万学生，宣布支持埃及学生和埃及全体人民联合一致为民族要求和世界和平而进行的斗争。
    国际学生联合会书记处接受埃及学生的要求，决定派遣国际学生代表团到埃及去，以表示其他国家的学生对埃及学生的声援。
