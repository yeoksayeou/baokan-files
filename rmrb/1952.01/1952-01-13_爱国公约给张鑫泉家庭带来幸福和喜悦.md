The patriotic pact brings happiness and joy to Zhang Xinquan's family

    Zhang Xinquan, a resident of Chengdu's First District in Sichuan Province, was a man who struggled to make ends meet by setting up a stall at rural markets before liberation. He lived a hand-to-mouth existence. After the Communist Party came, business became better, and he opened a paint shop. By June of last year, the shop's business had quickly expanded from two million yuan to six million yuan. At that time, special agents spread rumors saying, "Chiang Kai-shek will return." Zhang Xinquan was furious when he heard this. Mentioning Chiang Kai-shek reminded him of the suffering in the past. He was the first in his street to take the lead in responding to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and establish a family patriotic pact. His family patriotic pact was: "Investigate rumors, report bad people, support the government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries; don't be opportunistic, don't evade taxes, donate half of the net profit to buy airplanes to support the Volunteer Army." Because it had not been fully discussed at home, it was first opposed by his wife, Wen Yusu: "Report bad people, where are you going to report them? If you earn some money and donate half of it, what will we eat!" Zhang Xinquan then realized that to implement the patriotic pact well, he must first get through to his mother and wife. Therefore, in addition to attending meetings, he talked with his family members at home. He slowly made them understand that without resisting America and aiding Korea, without suppressing counter-revolutionaries, they could not protect their good life. The whole family received varying degrees of patriotic education. On this basis, in addition to passing the original two patriotic pacts, three more were seriously added: "Participate in resident studies, do a good job in providing preferential treatment to military families; guarantee good education for children; husband and wife respect and love each other, unite and engage in production." And it was agreed to check it every half month. But when it came to the check, sometimes no one spoke, sometimes they just talked about it, and if they didn't do it, they didn't reflect on it. Zhang Xinquan thought: "Now that there are shortcomings, as long as you are frank, the masses will help you correct them. Why can't we tell outsiders about things at home?" He proposed asking the masses to help check the pact, and the whole family agreed. But everyone had their own ideas. The son had opinions on the mother, and the wife had opinions on the husband, all wanting to take this opportunity to judge right and wrong. The next evening, Zhang Xinquan invited the nearby residents to the entrance of the shop and first talked about the process of establishing the patriotic pact. His seven-year-old child, Maoqing, spoke first: "That day, it was raining heavily, and Mom asked me to bring noodles. Because the road was slippery, I broke the bowl, and Mom didn't ask why, she just beat me." The little son boldly raised his opinion, which moved Wen Yusu. She criticized herself for not beating and scolding when educating her children, and also criticized herself for deliberately hiding the district's notice and not letting her husband go to the meeting. Zhang Xinquan criticized himself for not helping the families of martyrs and soldiers enough, for not respecting his wife's opinions, and for not conveying the information after coming back from the meeting. At this inspection meeting, the whole family spoke, and the masses also raised some opinions. Finally, Wen Yusu was elected as the inspector of the patriotic pact, and since then, Wen Yusu led the inspection every half month, and sometimes invited the masses to participate. Resident Chen Jianchun said: "I participated in Zhang Xinquan's family's inspection of the patriotic pact once, and received a very good education."
    The patriotic pact has brought happiness and joy to Zhang Xinquan's family. Through continuous inspection and revision of the patriotic pact, Wen Yusu's awareness and patriotic enthusiasm have been greatly improved. The husband and wife are more united. When the husband goes out to attend meetings, the wife takes care of the business and no longer closes the shop door to deliberately drive away customers. In less than three months, Zhang Xinquan's business developed from six million yuan to more than ten million yuan, and the amount of increased production and donations increased month by month, from 25,100 yuan per month to 31,700 yuan. His family's taxes were all deposited in the bank in advance, achieving monthly tax clearance. The lives of all nine members of the family went from being unable to sustain themselves to being able to sustain themselves and further improve.

    爱国公约给张鑫泉家庭带来幸福和喜悦
    方天
    四川省成都市一区张鑫泉是这样一个居民：解放前，他靠赶乡场摆摊摊糊口，一顿饱一顿饥，共产党来了，生意好做了，他才开起个颜料铺，去年六月间颜料铺的生意由二百万元很快扩大为六百万元。当时特务造谣说：“蒋介石还要打回来。”张鑫泉听到气得直冒火。提起蒋介石，他记起了过去的苦难日子，他在本街第一个带头响应抗美援朝总会的号召，订立了家庭爱国公约。他的家庭爱国公约是：“追查谣言，检举坏人，拥护政府镇压反革命分子；不取巧，不偷税，拿出所得纯利一半捐献买飞机支援志愿军。”因未经家中充分讨论，首先遭到妻子温玉素的反对：“检举坏人，你到那里去检举？赚点钱要捐出一半，自己吃啥子！”张鑫泉才觉得要把爱国公约执行好，首先要打通母亲和妻子的思想。因此，除去开会，他就在屋里和家里的人谈心。使她们慢慢懂得：不抗美援朝，不镇压反革命，就保不住自己的好日子。全家不同程度地都接受了爱国主义教育，在这个基础上，除通过原有两条爱国公约外，并认真增订了三条：“参加居民学习，做好优抚工作；保证教好子女；夫妻互敬互爱，团结闹生产。”并约定每半月检查一次。但到检查时，有时没人开腔，有时说说算了，做不到也不检讨。张鑫泉想：“现在有了缺点只要坦白，群众就会帮助你纠正。屋里头的事，为啥子不能对外人讲呢？”他提出请群众帮助检查公约，全家都同意了。但各人有各人的想法，儿子对母亲有意见，妻子对丈夫有意见，都想借此机会评评是非。第二天晚上，张鑫泉把附近的居民约集到铺门口，自己先讲了一下订立爱国公约的经过。他的一个七岁的孩子茂青先发言了：“那天下大雨，妈要我去端面，因为路滑，把碗摔碎了，妈不问什么原因，便打我
    一顿。”小儿子大胆提意见，感动了温玉素，她检讨了教育子女不该打骂，还检讨了自己不该故意藏起区里的通知，不让丈夫去开会等。张鑫泉检讨了对烈属、军属帮助不够，不尊重妻子意见，开会下来不传达的缺点。这次检查会，全家都发了言，群众也给提了些意见。最后并推选温玉素为爱国公约检查人，此后便每半月由温玉素领导检查，有时还约请群众参加。居民陈建春说：“我参加张鑫泉家检查一次爱国公约，便受到一次很好的教育。”
    爱国公约给张鑫泉的家庭带来了幸福与喜悦。经过不断地检查和修订爱国公约，温玉素的觉悟程度和爱国热情大大提高，夫妻间更团结了，丈夫出去开会，妻子照料生意，不再关起铺门故意把顾主碰走。不到三个月，张鑫泉的生意由六百万元发展到
    一千多万元，增产捐献数目逐月增加，由每月二万五千一百元增至三万一千七百元。他家的税款都是提前存到银行，做到月税月清，全家九口人的生活，从不能维持到能够维持并进一步改善了。
