    Supporting the People's Government's Arrest of Traitorous Merchants Like Liu Yuanjing

    To the Editor: After reading the People's Daily's report on the major crimes of traitorous merchants like Liu Yuanjing and Li Shanchang in stealing national property and sabotaging national defense construction, we are filled with immense indignation!

    Liu Yuanjing, this shameless traitorous merchant, after liberation, used extremely despicable means to feign activity and worm his way into the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference. For three years, despite the People's Government's multifaceted assistance and education, he has not changed his bandit nature in the slightest. In the large-scale, vigorous, and swift Three-Anti Campaign (Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy), Liu, Li, and other criminals have continued to adopt an attitude of hostility towards the state and the people. The People's Government's lawful arrest of these inhumane scum has won the support of the broad masses of the people.

    We demand that the government severely punish these traitorous merchants who steal state property and sabotage national defense construction.

    This major case has given us a further understanding of the importance and necessity of the Three-Anti Campaign. We will devote ourselves to this great movement with an even more resolute fighting spirit. There must be many more traitorous merchants like Liu Yuanjing and Li Shanchang, who are so despicable and shameless, stealing state property and endangering the construction of the motherland. In order to thoroughly eliminate these social vermin, we believe that it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses, raise vigilance, strengthen inspections, and unite from top to bottom to fight for the complete victory of the Three-Anti Campaign!

    拥护人民政府逮捕刘元敬等奸商
    编辑同志：我们看了人民日报发表的关于奸商刘元敬、李善长等盗骗国家财产、破坏国防建设的重大罪行，感到万分愤慨！
    刘元敬这个无耻奸商，在解放后，以极卑鄙的手段，伪装积极，混进北京市人民代表会议。三年来，虽经人民政府多方面的帮助和教育，却丝毫未改变强盗本质。在大张旗鼓、雷厉风行的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，刘、李等犯竟继续采取和国家、人民为敌的态度。人民政府依法逮捕这种毫无人性的败类，获得了广大人民的拥护。
    我们要求政府严厉惩办这些盗窃国家财产，破坏国防建设的奸商。
    这个重大案件，使我们对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的重要性和必要性，有了更进一步的认识。我们要以更坚决的战斗精神，投入这个伟大的运动。像刘元敬、李善长这样卑鄙无耻、盗骗国家财产、危害祖国建设的奸商，一定还有不少。为了把这些社会上的毒虫彻底肃清，我们认为，必须发动广大群众，提高警惕，加强检查，上下一致，为反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的彻底胜利而斗争！
