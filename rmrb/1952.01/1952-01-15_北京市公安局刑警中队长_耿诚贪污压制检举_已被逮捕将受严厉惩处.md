Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Criminal Police Detachment Leader
Geng Cheng Embezzled, Suppressed Reports
Arrested, to Face Severe Punishment
Geng Cheng, the leader of the Second Squad of the Criminal Police Detachment of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, consistently abused his power, extorted, and practiced graft, committing serious acts of embezzlement. During this anti-corruption and anti-waste movement, not only did he refuse to confess himself, but he also suppressed others from reporting. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has arrested him and will punish him according to the law.

Geng Cheng came from a landlord background and served as a puppet army officer. He infiltrated the Party in 1948. He usually pretended to be active in his work but, in reality, completely inherited the bad habits of the old Kuomintang police. In 1949, when the Criminal Police Team cracked a case of trafficking in opium, Geng Cheng took the opportunity to extort two taels of gold. In 1950, Geng Cheng handled an embezzlement case, in which he leaked work secrets to the embezzler and accepted a bribe of four million yuan. On another occasion, when the Criminal Police Team cracked a case of selling heroin, Geng Cheng replaced more than seven qian of real heroin with fake heroin. In addition, the property he embezzled and accepted as bribes, which has now been investigated, includes: US$55, two gold rings, a diamond ring, and several million yuan in cash.

Geng Cheng not only showed no remorse for his illegal acts, but also adopted a deceptive and resistant attitude towards the organization, attempting to escape his guilt. Before the anti-corruption movement began, the Criminal Police Team cracked a drug trafficking case, involving a drug trafficker who had been extorted by Geng Cheng for gold. Fearing exposure of his illegal activities, Geng Cheng immediately notified the criminal not to confess. After the city-wide anti-corruption movement was launched with great fanfare, the leading cadres of the Criminal Police Detachment repeatedly mobilized people, explaining the policies. Many people with acts of corruption confessed to the organization, but Geng Cheng not only refused to confess, but also tried to cover up his crimes in various ways. He called the people he had extorted, forbidding them to report him. He also tampered with accounts; using various methods to threaten a retained personnel member who had jointly embezzled with him not to confess. He said, "There's no benefit for you if you confess. The way we deal with Party members is different from the way we deal with you. If you confess, I'll shoot myself to death with a gun." The implication was a threat: You won't live either!

Geng Cheng's criminal acts of embezzlement, extortion, and blackmail are extremely serious, but if he had been willing to confess to the organization, he could have been given lenient treatment depending on the circumstances; however, he stubbornly refused to repent, suppressed reports, and resisted to the end. The government must severely punish such incorrigible corrupt elements.

The leading cadres of the Criminal Police Detachment had been misled by Geng Cheng's superficial "active and capable" appearance for a long time, and actually believed he was a "good cadre," failing to notice his consistent graft for a long time. They should conduct a profound self-criticism of this serious bureaucratic style.

### 北京市公安局刑警中队长  耿诚贪污压制检举  已被逮捕将受严厉惩处

    北京市公安局刑警中队长
    耿诚贪污压制检举
    已被逮捕将受严厉惩处
    北京市公安局刑警大队第二中队队长耿诚，一贯利用职权，勒索敲诈，贪赃枉法，有严重的贪污罪行。他在这次反贪污浪费运动中，不但自己拒不坦白，而且还压制别人检举。市公安局已把他逮捕，将依法惩处。
    耿诚是地主出身，当过伪军官，于一九四八年混入党内，平常在工作上假装积极，实际上完全承袭国民党旧警察的恶劣作风。一九四九年，刑警队破获一件贩卖烟毒案，耿诚乘机敲诈了二两黄金。一九五零年，耿诚办理一件贪污案，他把工作秘密泄露给贪污犯，受贿四百万元。又有一次刑警队破获一个贩卖白面案，耿诚竟用假白面换出真白面七钱多。此外，他贪污受贿的财物，现在已经调查出来的计有：美钞五十五元，金戒指两个，钻戒一个，现金数百万元。
    耿诚对自己所做的违法行为，不但一点不知悔改，并且还对组织采取欺骗和抗拒的态度，企图逃避自己的罪责。在反贪污运动没有开始前，刑警队破获一个贩毒案，牵连到曾被耿诚敲诈过黄金的贩毒犯。耿诚怕暴露自己的非法行为，竟立即通知该犯不要坦白。在全市大张旗鼓的反贪污运动开始后，刑警大队的领导干部反复动员，说明政策，许多有贪污行为的人纷纷向组织交代问题；而耿诚不但拒不坦白，还用各种办法企图掩盖罪行。他曾打电话给被他敲诈过的人，不许他们检举。他自己又涂改账目；用各种办法，威胁一个曾与他共同贪污的留用人员不要坦白，他说：“你坦白了，没你的好处。处理我们党员，跟你们不一样。你要是坦白，我就用枪打死我自己。”意思就是威胁说：你也不能活！
    耿诚的贪污敲诈勒索的罪恶行为，是非常严重的，但他如果肯于向组织坦白，还可以根据情况从轻处理；然而他却死不悔悟，压制检举，抗拒到底。对待这种怙恶不悛的贪污分子，政府一定要严厉制裁。
    刑警大队的领导干部，过去一直被耿诚表面的“积极能干”所迷惑，居然还认为他是“好干部”，对他一贯的贪赃枉法行为长期丝毫没有察觉。他们对这种严重的官僚主义作风，应该进行深刻的检讨。
