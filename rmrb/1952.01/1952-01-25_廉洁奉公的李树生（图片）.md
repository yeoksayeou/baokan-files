    4. It turned out that this timber merchant often issued fake invoices and bribed cadres in order to sell inferior wood as high-quality wood. Not long after, Li Shusheng came to buy wood planks again. The boss thought, "My chance has come!" and tried to take him to a restaurant for a meal. Li Shusheng resolutely refused and immediately urged the boss to go look at the wood together.
    5. Along the way, the boss kept talking about the decadent life in the city to tempt Li Shusheng. Li Shusheng turned his head and glared at him fiercely. Only then did the boss change the subject. When looking at the wood, the boss pretended to be very serious and said, "Comrade Li, you are an old customer. If you have any difficulties at home, we can help!" Li Shusheng ignored him. He bought 119 zhang of "Hunan Pine" planks and left.
    6. The next evening, Li Shusheng was not at home. Someone delivered one million yuan to his house, claiming to be Li Shusheng's friend and willing to help him solve his family's difficulties. Li Shusheng's wife did not dare to accept the money. Just then, Li Shusheng happened to come home.

    四、原来这个木行老板时常开假发票，贿赂干部，以次木料当好木料出售。不久，李树生又来买木板。老板心想“机会到了”，便拉他去吃馆子。李树生坚决拒绝，立刻催老板一同去看木料。
    五、一路上老板尽讲些城市的腐化生活，来引诱李树生。李树生回头狠狠地瞪了他一眼。老板才用别的话岔开。在看木料的时候，老板装得满正经地说：“李同志，您是老主顾了，如果家里有困难，咱们可以帮忙！”李树生没有理他。买定了一百一十九丈“湖南松”木板就走了。
    六、第二天晚上，李树生不在家。有人给家里送来一百万元，自称是李树生的朋友，愿意帮他解决家庭困难。李树生的老婆不敢收下这笔钱。正在这时，恰好李树生回家来了。
