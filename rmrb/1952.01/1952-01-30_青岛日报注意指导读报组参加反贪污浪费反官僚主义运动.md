Editor's Note: Reading groups are a powerful force for expanding the guiding role of newspapers. Qingdao Daily's leadership in guiding city-wide reading groups to actively participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is a practice worth promoting. We are publishing Qingdao Daily's letter here for the reference of newspapers and reading groups in various regions. At the same time, we hope that newspapers and reading groups in various regions will inform us of the activities and problems of reading groups in the current movement. People's Daily Reader's Letter Group: Regarding the issue of mobilizing reading groups to actively participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, we have already sent a general contact letter to reading groups throughout the city, which was also published in the newspaper. The city's reading groups, through the reading group representative meeting in November last year, and the evaluation of model reading groups and reading members, are generally relatively sound. Currently, the main study material for reading groups is reports on anti-corruption, anti-waste, anti-bureaucracy, and increased production and conservation. Some reading members, through the newspaper, have understood the people's government's policies and determination regarding this movement, broken through ideological concerns, and begun to report violations. Some reading groups have regarded active participation in the movement as their patriotic action, supplementing it in their patriotic covenants; at the same time, they have also paid attention to publicizing the movement to the masses, compiling wall newspapers and blackboards, and combining them with Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities to promote the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and mobilize the masses to actively participate. Recently, we have also held small-scale meetings of reading group leaders and reading members (two or three police station districts) in various districts to further deploy and mobilize reading groups throughout the city to participate in this movement. At the same time, we must combine this movement to reorganize, consolidate, and develop reading groups, and strive to develop another 50,000 people to participate in reading groups this year (according to statistics in November last year, 57,113 people participated in reading groups in the city). In order to guide the reading groups to actively participate in this movement in a timely manner, our newspaper's "Reader's Letters from Reading Groups" and "Reading Group Work" columns pay special attention to publishing materials in this area.

    青岛日报注意指导读报组参加反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动
    编者按：读报组是扩大报纸指导作用的一支有力的队伍。青岛日报领导全市读报组积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，这种做法是值得推广的。我们在这里把青岛日报的来信发表出来，希望各地报纸和读报组参考；同时，希望各地报纸和读报组把读报组在目前运动中的活动情况和问题告诉我们。人民日报读者来信组：关于发动读报组积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的问题，我们已经普遍向全市读报组发出一封联系信，这封信同时在报上发表了。本市读报组经过去年十一月份的读报组代表会议，和读报组、读报员评选模范工作，一般地说是比较健全的。目前读报组主要学习材料是关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义和增产节约的报道。某些读报员通过报纸，了解了人民政府对这个运动的政策和决心，打破了思想顾虑，开始进行检举。有的读报组把积极参加运动，作为自己的爱国行动，补充在爱国公约里；同时还注意了对群众的宣传工作，编壁报、黑板报，并结合春节文化娱乐活动，来宣传反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，并发动群众积极参加。最近我们又分别在各区召开了小型读报组长、读报员会议（两、三个派出所管区），进一步布置和发动全市读报组都参加这个运动。同时我们要结合这个运动来整理巩固和发展读报组，争取在今年内再发展五万人参加读报组（据去年十一月统计全市有五万七千一百一十三人参加读报组）。为了及时地指导各读报组积极参加这个运动，我们报纸的“读报组来信”、“读报组工作”栏都特别注意发表这方面的材料。青岛日报读者来信组
