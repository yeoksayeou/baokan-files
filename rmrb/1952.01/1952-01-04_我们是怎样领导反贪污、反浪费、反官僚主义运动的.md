Editor's note: The experience of the Central People's Government News Administration's Broadcasting Affairs Bureau in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is worth referencing for other regions. The experience of leading cadres first conducting self-examinations at the start of the movement, carrying out serious criticism and self-criticism, and mobilizing the masses to vigorously launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has been proven effective in various regions. The organizational role of the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau's Party organization in the movement is also worth promoting.

The Central People's Government News Administration's Broadcasting Affairs Bureau's honest and sincere, politically conscious study movement concluded in early October of last year. The Party group, considering the serious nature of work errors in the editing departments and the phenomena of corruption and waste in the technical departments, decided to launch a year-end inspection campaign throughout the bureau.

The Party group of the office, with the approval of the sub-Party committee, decided to start by reorganizing the Party's general branch. The first and second general branch committees of the bureau were both designated by the office's Party group and the sub-Party committee. Since the spring of 1949, for more than two years, it had never reported its work to Party members, nor had it democratically elected the Party's leading organs in accordance with the Party Constitution. Criticism and self-criticism had not been carried out within the Party, especially among Party member cadres, and the political atmosphere was generally very thin. Under these circumstances, bureaucracy grew, and the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of Party members and the masses were stifled. With the help of the office's Party group, the general branch held a meeting of Party members in late October. At the meeting, Party members strictly criticized the leadership of the general branch and democratically elected a new general branch committee. The new general branch committee members all agreed with the office's Party group's opinion: that one of the deputy directors should serve as the general branch secretary (he later also became the secretary of the office's Party group).

The primary task of the new general branch was to expand democratic life and carry out criticism and self-criticism. This was the main prerequisite for mobilizing the masses and helping the leadership improve the Party's and government's work in the bureau. Within a week of its establishment, the general branch published a small Party journal, "Party Life" (approximately 10,000 words per issue, published weekly). Although some Party members initially doubted this approach, some even saying that criticizing some of the bureau's leaders in the Party journal would damage their prestige among the masses, the general branch firmly decided to continue publishing it and called on all Party members to fight against bureaucracy and various phenomena that harm the Party's interests in the bureau. The general branch also guaranteed that every Party member's correct criticism would be acted upon.

After four issues of "Party Life" were published, Party life became significantly more active. Some comrades who had previously been afraid of retaliation and offending people, after ideological struggles, finally wrote down or spoke out their opinions. One Party member said that she had never felt the Party's concern for her as much as she did now, and that branch life was so educational.

At the same time, the general branch, on the one hand, helped the masses and provided leadership to establish the trade union, and on the other hand, mobilized all Party members to assist the administrative heads in carrying out the inspection work campaign.

Once the Party's criticism and self-criticism and the administratively arranged inspection work were launched, many previously concealed problems were exposed, and the confrontational emotions of individual Party members (all of whom were administrative heads) became more pronounced. For example, some became passive in their work, dissatisfied, and complained everywhere after being criticized; some were unwilling to publicly admit their mistakes after receiving correct criticism; some stood by and watched the unfolding inspection campaign. Based on the above situation, the general branch believed that it was necessary to further carry out criticism and self-criticism among the responsible Party member cadres, while at the same time opening up the cadres' minds and helping the leadership, otherwise the Party's democratic life would be hindered, and the inspection work campaign would not be able to deepen or receive sound leadership.

When the office's Party group decided in late November of last year to launch a bureau-wide anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement based on the inspection work, the general branch, on the one hand, mobilized within the Party, calling on all Party members to guarantee three points: 1. Those with corrupt or wasteful behavior should confess to the Party and make ideological self-criticism; 2. Report any known corrupt or wasteful behavior; 3. Seriously help the leadership to ensure that the movement achieves full victory; on the other hand, with the consent of the office's Party group, it also convened an enlarged meeting of the general branch. The office's Party group and sixteen Party member cadres at the department director level all participated. The meeting mainly reviewed the bureau's leadership and offered opinions to the director, deputy directors, and deputy secretary-general (all of whom were Party members), who also conducted self-criticism. The meeting lasted for seven full nights. Initially, some Party members were very emotional, and their speeches included personal sentiments; but after serious criticism, the meeting went very well, and all Party member cadres participating in the meeting were prepared for the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and were united in thought and full of confidence. The gains of this meeting far exceeded those of the Party rectification of the previous year.

Therefore, at the beginning of the movement, the bureau's负责人(fuzeren- people in charge/responsible people) made self-criticisms at the general mobilization meeting after explaining the significance of the movement, which had not happened in the past. The heads of various departments also made serious self-reviews at the general meetings of their respective departments. The leaders set an example, which not only enhanced the Party's prestige among the masses but also eliminated the masses' concerns. Some people immediately responded after the负责人(fuzeren- people in charge/responsible people) made their reviews and confessed their corrupt behavior. Some not only dared to report others but also dared to sharply criticize the bureau directors' non-compliance with the system and wasteful behavior at the meeting. On the third day of the movement, the administrative side received more than one hundred written materials confessing and reporting corrupt behavior of all sizes.

During the movement, the general branch and various branches divided the work and seriously and timely criticized and helped some Party members who were behaving poorly and dishonestly. Two Party members with more serious corrupt behavior refused to confess at the study meetings, and finally, after the branch gave them severe criticism, they publicly admitted their corrupt behavior. The general branch repeatedly pointed out to Party members that the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement should not only fight against corrupt and wasteful behavior manifested in economic work but also fight ideologically against the selfish and self-interested, feudalistic, and capitalistic reactionary ideas; not only Party members but also all staff members should be educated and transformed in the movement. The Party must take on the task of leading this ideological struggle; only in this way can we eliminate corruption and waste and correct bureaucracy in leadership.

In mid-December, while the technical and administrative departments were still continuing the anti-corruption struggle, the editing department had ended the anti-corruption and anti-waste phase and entered the anti-bureaucracy phase. This struggle would be difficult to do well without the leadership of the branch. We have this experience: when the leaders' thinking and work style have some problems, and there are many shortcomings in the department's work, and there has been a lack of criticism and self-criticism in the past, many opinions have been suppressed. Once democratic life is launched, many opinions will be raised about the leaders, although some opinions are inevitably biased, with personal sentiments, not realistic, and not with the intention of helping. Under these circumstances, the branch must have a good understanding of the masses' ideological situation, provide necessary persuasion and education, and guide them onto the right track. This is a very delicate ideological work. A little carelessness will either discourage the masses or make the branch a tail of the masses, bringing losses to the work. The editing department's branch, with the help of the general branch, has done a lot of hard work since the beginning of the movement. At the beginning, it was mobilization, in the middle, it was clearing up thinking, and now, it must also give play to the creativity and enthusiasm of all personnel to jointly study how to improve work quality, eliminate work errors, and strengthen unity between superiors and subordinates and with each other.

Our general branch has been established for less than two months. Currently, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the bureau is still continuing and is expected to end in mid-January this year. What is said here is only some of the work of the general branch before and after the start of the movement. We still have many shortcomings, and we are determined to continue to improve them in future work.

    我们是怎样领导反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的
    中共广播事业局总支委员会
    编者按：中央人民政府新闻总署广播事业局反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的经验值得各地参考。领导干部在运动开始时首先进行自我检查，实行严肃的批评和自我批评，发动群众，大张旗鼓地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的经验，已经各地证明是行之有效的。广播事业局党的组织在运动中发挥了组织和领导的作用，这也是值得推广的。
    中央人民政府新闻总署广播事业局的忠诚老实、政治自觉学习运动在去年十月初结束后，党组鉴于编辑部门的工作错误和技术部门的贪污浪费现象都很严重，决定在全局开展年终检查工作运动。
    机关党组得到分党委的同意，决定先从改组党的总支开始。本局第一、二届总支委员会都是由机关党组和分党委指定的。它自从一九四九年春以后，二年多来从未向党员报告过工作，也没有照党章民主地选出党的领导机关。在党内，特别是在党员干部之间没有展开批评和自我批评，政治空气一般说很稀薄。在这种情形下，官僚主义滋长了，党员群众的积极性和责任心受到窒息。在机关党组帮助下，总支在十月底开了党员大会，党员在会上严格地批评了总支的领导，并民主地选出了新的总支委。新的总支委员都同意机关党组的意见：由副局长一人任总支书（他后来又是机关党组书记）。
    新总支的首要任务，就是扩大民主生活，展开批评和自我批评。因为这是发动群众，帮助领导方面来改进本机关党的和政府的工作的主要前提。总支在成立后一个星期，即出版了小型的党刊“党内生活”（每期约一万字，每周出一次）。尽管开始时有个别党员怀疑这种做法，有的甚至说在党刊上批评局的一些负责人会损害他们在群众中的威信。但总支坚决把它出下去，而且号召所有党员同本机关的官僚主义和各种损害党的利益的现象进行斗争。总支还保证每个党员的正确批评都能得到结果。
    “党内生活”出版了四期，党内生活显著地活跃起来。有些过去怕报复、怕得罪人的同志，经过思想斗争之后，终于把意见写出来或谈出来。有一个党员说，她从未像现在这样感到党对她的关心，支部生活对她如此富于教育意义。
    与此同时，总支一方面帮助群众并给予领导，把工会建立起来，一方面动员全体党员协助行政负责人展开检查工作的运动。
    当党内的批评与自我批评和行政上布置的检查工作一经展开之后，许多过去被掩盖的毛病暴露了出来，而个别党员（都是行政上的负责人）的对抗情绪也表现得更显著。例如，有的在受了批评之后，工作消极，心怀不满，到处发牢骚；有的在受到了正确的批评之后，不愿公开承认错误；有的对正在展开的检查运动，袖手旁观。根据上述情况，总支认为必须在负责的党员干部之间进一步地开展批评和自我批评，同时打通干部思想，帮助领导，否则党内民主生活就受到阻碍，检查工作运动就不可能深入和得不到健全的领导。
    当去年十一月底机关党组决定在检查工作的基础上发动全局反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动之后，总支一方面在党内进行动员，号召全体党员保证三点：一、有贪污浪费行为的应该向党坦白并作思想检讨；二、检举所知的贪污浪费行为；三、认真帮助领导方面，务使运动获得充分胜利；另一方面，在征得机关党组同意后，又召开了总支扩大会议。机关党组和十六个处长一级的党员干部都参加。会上主要检讨局的领导，并对正副局长和副秘书长（都是党员）提意见，他们也都进行了自我批评。这次会一连开了七个整晚。开始有个别党员很激动，发言中夹带个人意气；但经过严肃的批评之后，会开得很好，参加会议的所有党员干部，对展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动有了准备，而且思想一致，充满信心。这次会的收获很大，远超过前年的整党。
    因此，运动一开始，局的负责人便在全体动员大会上，在说明了运动的意义之后作了自我批评，这是过去所没有的。各部门负责人，也分别在各部门的全体会议上作了严肃的自我检讨。负责人以身作则，不但提高了党在群众中的威信，而且消除了群众的顾虑。有一些人在负责人作了检讨之后，立即响应，坦白了自己的贪污行为。有一些人不但敢于检举别人，而且敢于在会上尖锐地批评局长们的不遵守制度和浪费行为。在运动的第三天，行政方面就收到了坦白、检举大小贪污行为的书面材料一百多件。
    在运动中，总支和各支部进行了分工，都认真地和及时地批评、帮助一些表现不好的和不老实的党员。有两个贪污行为较严重的党员，在学习会上拒不坦白，最后终于在支部给予了严厉的批评之后，公开承认了自己的贪污行为。总支一再向党员指出：反贪污、反浪费的运动，不但要和表现在经济工作上的贪污浪费行为作斗争，而且应该在思想上和自私自利的、损公利己的封建主义和资本主义的反动思想作斗争；不但要使党员，而且要使全体工作人员在运动中得到教育和改造。党必须把领导这种思想斗争的工作担负起来，只有这样，才能杜绝贪污、浪费和改正领导方面的官僚主义。
    十二月中旬，当技术、行政部门还在继续进行反贪污斗争的时候，编辑部门已结束了反贪污反浪费，进入反官僚主义的阶段。这个斗争，如果没有支部的领导，那是很难做好的。我们有这样的经验，当领导人思想作风有些毛病，部门的工作也有许多缺点，过去又缺乏批评和自我批评，许多意见一直被积压下来，一旦民主生活开展，对领导人的意见就会提得特别多，虽然难免有些意见是偏激的、带私人意气的、不是实事求是和与人为善的。在这种情形下，支部就必须很好地掌握群众的思想情况，给予必要的说服和教育，把他们引导到正轨上来。这是一种很细致的思想工作，稍微不慎，不是给群众泼了冷水，就是做了群众的尾巴，给工作带来了损失。编辑部门的支部，在总支帮助下，从运动开始，就做了很艰苦的工作，开始是动员，中间是打通思想，而现在，还须发挥全体人员的创造性和积极性，共同来研究如何提高工作质量、消灭工作错误和加强上下之间相互之间的团结。
    我们的总支从成立到现在还不到两个月。现在本机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动还在继续中，估计今年一月中才能结束。这里说的只是总支在运动开始前后的一些工作。我们的毛病还很多，我们决心在今后工作中继续加以改进。
