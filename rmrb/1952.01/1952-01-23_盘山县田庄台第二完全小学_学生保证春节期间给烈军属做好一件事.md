    Pan Shan County Tian Zhuang Tai No. 2 Elementary School
    Students Pledge to Do a Good Deed for the Families of Martyrs and Soldiers During the Spring Festival
    To all elementary school students across the country:

    In response to the call to do a good deed for the families of martyrs and soldiers during the Spring Festival, we have already organized our visitation groups and are now challenging you.

    During the Spring Festival, all 1,640 students in our school pledge to save the money they would have spent on candy and firecrackers to comfort the families of martyrs and soldiers.

    There are over 37 million elementary school students across the country. If we all do this during the Spring Festival, how happy would our People's Liberation Army uncles and Volunteer Army uncles be! Furthermore, the effect of our saving candy and firecracker money would be significant. If each of us can save 1,000 yuan, the country would have 37 billion yuan, which is equivalent to the value of more than 20 airplanes.

    Students, we hope you will accept our challenge!

    盘山县田庄台第二完全小学
    学生保证春节期间给烈军属做好一件事
    全国各小学校同学们：
    我们为响应在春节期间给烈属、军属做好一件事的号召，现在我们已经把访问小组组织好了，特向你们挑战。
    春节期间，我校一千六百四十名同学，人人保证节省糖果花炮费，用来慰劳烈属、军属。
    我们全国小同学有三千七百多万人，春节期间都这样做，我们的解放军叔叔、志愿军叔叔知道了，该会多么高兴。并且，我们节省糖果花炮费的效果也很大，我们每个人如果能节省一千块钱，全国就有三百七十亿，顶二十多架飞机的价值。
    同学们，希望你们应战吧！
