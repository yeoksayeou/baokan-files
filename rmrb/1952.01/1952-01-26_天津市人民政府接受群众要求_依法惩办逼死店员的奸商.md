    The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Accepts the People's Demands and Punishes the Unscrupulous Merchants Who Forced a Shop Assistant to Death According to Law
    [This newspaper reports] The unscrupulous merchants Jia Shoushan and Zhao Shaozhen of Tianjin dared to undermine the shop assistants' movement against bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets, forcing the shop assistant Zhang Yuting, who reported them, to death. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government, accepting the people's demands, has arrested these two unscrupulous merchants and will hold a public trial soon.
    Jia Shoushan is the manager of Tianjin Changji Timber Firm, and Zhao Shaozhen is the deputy manager. These unscrupulous merchants have consistently evaded taxes, traded gold, bribed cadres, and stolen state assets, committing all kinds of evil deeds. Some of these illegal activities of Jia and Zhao were done by instructing the shop assistant Zhang Yuting to do them. During this movement, Zhang Yuting's class consciousness was raised. On January 9th, at the Tianjin Sixth District's general meeting of shop assistants to expose unscrupulous merchants, he reported Jia Shoushan and Zhao Shaozhen's illegal acts of bribing cadres from units such as the North China Foreign Trade Company. At this time, Zhang Yuting still had concerns and did not expose all the illegal activities of Changji Timber Firm. The union cadres continuously encouraged and educated him, urging him to conduct a bold and thorough exposure with the attitude of a master. On January 13th, Zhang Yuting reported all the illegal activities of Changji Timber Firm to the union and also reviewed his mistake of helping the unscrupulous merchants do bad things. The union immediately praised Zhang Yuting. The unscrupulous merchants knew that Zhang Yuting had reported them, so on the evening of the 14th, they intimidated Zhang Yuting. Under the pretext of auditing accounts, the unscrupulous merchants held a meeting, insisting that Zhang Yuting had bribed and accepted bribes, and demanding that he be responsible for all the illegal activities of Changji Timber Firm. They tortured Zhang Yuting all night. The next morning, Zhang Yuting went home and told his wife, "I can't live anymore. The shop held a meeting all night, and they all attacked me. I have no way out." After saying this, Zhang Yuting returned to the shop and committed suicide with a kitchen knife.
    The illegal actions of the unscrupulous merchants aroused the infinite anger of the broad masses of workers. Everyone unanimously demanded that the government severely punish these two lawless merchants.

    天津市人民政府接受群众要求
    依法惩办逼死店员的奸商
    【本报讯】天津市不法奸商贾寿山和赵绍珍胆敢破坏店员的反对行贿、反对偷漏、反对盗窃国家资财运动，逼死检举他们的店员张玉亭。天津市人民政府接受群众要求，已经逮捕了这两个奸商，并将在最近举行公审。
    贾寿山是天津长记木行的经理，赵绍珍是副经理。这些奸商一贯偷漏税款、买卖黄金，贿赂干部，盗窃国家资财，无恶不做。贾、赵二犯这些犯法勾当，有些是支使店员张玉亭做的。在这次运动中，张玉亭的阶级觉悟提高了。他在一月九日天津市六区全体店员检举奸商的大会上，检举了贾寿山和赵绍珍贿赂华北对外贸易公司等单位的干部的犯法行为。这时张玉亭还有顾虑，并没有把长记木行的全部犯法行为都揭发出来。工会干部不断地鼓励和教育他，要他以主人翁的态度，大胆彻底地进行检举。一月十三日，张玉亭把长记木行的全部犯法行为报告给工会，同时检讨了自己帮助奸商作坏事的错误。工会立即表扬了张玉亭。奸商知道张玉亭检举了他们，就在十四日的晚上，对张玉亭进行恫吓。奸商以查账为名，召开会议，硬说张玉亭曾经行贿，受贿，要他对长记木行的一切非法行为负责。他们把张玉亭整整折磨了一夜。第二天早上，张玉亭回家告诉妻子说：“我活不了啦，柜上开了一夜会，他们都攻击我，我没路可走了。”说完，张玉亭就回到行里，用切菜刀自杀了。
    奸商的非法行为，激起了广大工人的无限愤怒。大家一致要求政府严惩这两个目无法纪的奸商。
