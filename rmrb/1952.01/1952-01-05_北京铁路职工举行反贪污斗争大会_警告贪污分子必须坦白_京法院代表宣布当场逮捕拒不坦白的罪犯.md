Xinhua News Agency, January 4th – Yesterday morning, all employees of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration held an anti-corruption struggle meeting. In addition to the employees of the Beijing Railway Branch, representatives from various factories, enterprises, institutions, and organizations in Beijing Municipality also attended the meeting. In total, more than 3,000 people were present. The meeting specifically and vividly clarified the policies of the People's Government to the masses, especially pointing out the path for corrupt elements: "Complete confession is the only way out for corrupt elements!"

The meeting began with a speech by Lu Wen, Director of the Beijing Railway Branch. He succinctly described the Beijing Railway Branch's achievement of increasing production and practicing economy by 100 billion yuan last year, pointing out that anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy are key steps in further developing the movement to increase production and practice economy. Then, he welcomed those who sincerely repented and genuinely confessed during this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and warned the few corrupt smugglers who refused to confess or even attempted to sabotage the movement, saying: "Some people downplay the serious, talk about the small things but not the big, talk about the distant past but not the recent, trying every means to get away with it. Then let us tell them: today's meeting is to show everyone our 'bottom line.' Our 'bottom line' is very simple: first, confession is the only way out for smugglers and corrupt elements; second, those who genuinely confess or report meritorious deeds will be treated leniently, that is, those with serious crimes will have their sentences reduced, and those with minor crimes will have their penalties reduced or waived; third, those who resist or sabotage the movement will be punished more severely."

Subsequently, Guo Xiuzhen, Director of the Political Department of the Beijing Railway Branch, on behalf of the Economy Inspection Committee, announced two different conclusions regarding nine cases involving significant corruption and smuggling. The first type was for those who sincerely repented, confessed thoroughly, and reported meritorious deeds, who would be treated leniently. This category included Deng Wenming, Jia Heming, and four others. For example, Deng Wenming smuggled contraband worth more than 10.03 million yuan from March 1949 to August 1950. He had thoroughly confessed during the honest and sincere study session in 1951, and in this movement, he also reported many drug trafficking and corrupt elements, especially exposing the criminal activities of a certain corrupt element who convened a secret meeting to obstruct the movement and actively fought against this corrupt element, causing him to finally confess his crimes. The proposed treatment for Deng Wenming was to be exempted from legal and administrative sanctions. The second type was for those who refused to confess and sabotaged the movement, who would be punished more severely. This category included Chang Yulin, Mu Shijie, and Shen Zhenhuan. For example, Chang Yulin had repeatedly trafficked opium, silver dollars, gold, and other contraband since liberation, but he still did not admit it after being reported. In 1950, the leadership mobilized him to confess, but he downplayed the serious things and only talked about the small things, and threatened others. He also convened secret meetings during this movement to sabotage the movement. Mu Shijie, nicknamed "General Smuggler," not only did not confess his own problems but also engaged in inciting discord and obstructing the development of the movement. Shen Zhenhuan, who had consistently engaged in corruption and malpractice, stubbornly refused to tell the truth and also tried to sabotage the movement in various ways. These three corrupt smugglers who obstructed the movement should be arrested and severely punished according to the law.

Next, He Zhanjun, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the Beijing Municipal People's Court, announced on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Court: corrupt smugglers Chang Yulin, Mu Shijie, and Shen Zhenhuan were arrested on the spot. He pointed out: "Corruption is a crime, and it is also a serious crime. The People's Court must severely punish corrupt elements. However, in order to encourage corrupt elements to repent and start anew, different treatment methods are still adopted based on different circumstances, especially whether or not they confess and repent. For corrupt elements like Chang Yulin, Mu Shijie, and Shen Zhenhuan, we have done a lot of educational work for them, but they are still unwilling to thoroughly confess their criminal behavior to the government, and even dare to resist, obstruct, and sabotage the movement. Therefore, the People's Court has decided to arrest them according to the law and will punish them more severely." He called on all corrupt elements to take Deng Wenming and the other five as examples, confess their mistakes, and expose the mistakes of others.

Jia Heming, Wu Jialin, and Li Engui, corrupt elements who were treated leniently for thoroughly confessing, made painful self-criticisms of their past criminal behavior at the meeting and expressed their determination to repent to everyone. Li Engui also used his own example to advise all corrupt smugglers to thoroughly confess and boldly report, saying:

"Only thorough confession is the only way out for corrupt smugglers."

    北京铁路职工举行反贪污斗争大会
    警告贪污分子必须坦白
    京法院代表宣布当场逮捕拒不坦白的罪犯
    【新华社四日讯】四日上午，天津铁路管理局北京分局全体职工举行反贪污斗争大会。除北京铁路分局职工外，北京市各工厂、企业、机关、团体都派代表参加了大会。到会共有三千多人。大会具体而生动地向群众阐明了人民政府的政策，特别是向贪污分子指明了道路：“彻底坦白是贪污分子唯一的出路！”
    大会首由北京铁路分局局长鲁文讲话。他扼要地叙述了北京铁路分局去年增产节约一千亿元的成绩，指出反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义是进一步开展增产节约运动的关键性的步骤。接着，他对那些在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中真心悔改切实坦白的人表示欢迎，对少数拒不坦白、甚至企图破坏运动的贪污走私分子提出警告，他说：“有些人避重就轻、讲小不讲大、讲远不讲近，到处探我们的风、摸我们的底，千方百计想混过关，那么让我们告诉他：今天的大会就是给大家看看‘底’。我们的‘底’很简单：第一、坦白是走私贪污分子唯一的出路；第二、凡是切实坦白或检举立功者一定宽大处理，即罪重者减罪，罪轻者减轻处分或免予处分；第三、凡是抵抗、破坏运动者一定加重惩办。”
    继由北京铁路分局政治处主任郭修真代表节约检查委员会，宣布对九个案情较大的贪污走私分子两种不同的结论。第一种是真心悔改、彻底坦白并检举立功的，从宽处理。属于这类的有邓文明、贾鹤鸣等六人。如邓文明在一九四九年三月到一九五○年八月，共走私得赃款一千零三十多万元，一九五一年忠诚老实学习时已彻底坦白，这次运动又检举不少运毒贪污分子，特别是揭发了某贪污分子曾召开秘密会议阻挠运动的罪恶活动并积极跟这个贪污分子展开斗争，使他终于坦白了自己的罪恶。对于邓文明的处理意见是免除法律和行政处分。第二种是拒不坦白并破坏运动的，加重惩处。属于这类的有常玉麟、沐士杰、沈振寰等三人。如常玉麟在解放以来屡次贩运鸦片、白洋、黄金等违禁品，经检举仍不承认，一九五○年领导方面即动员他坦白，他却避重就轻、谈小不谈大，并威胁别人，这次运动中又召开秘密会议，破坏运动。绰号“走私大将”的沐士杰，不仅不坦白自己的问题，并进行挑拨离间，阻挠运动的开展。一贯贪污舞弊的沈振寰，坚不吐实，还多方破坏运动。对于这三个阻挠运动的贪污走私分子，应依法逮捕，严厉惩办。
    接着，北京市人民法院刑事庭庭长贺战军代表北京市人民法院宣布：当场逮捕贪污走私犯常玉麟、沐士杰、沈振寰三人。他指出：“贪污是犯罪的，并且还是严重的罪行。人民法院必须严厉惩办贪污分子。但为了鼓励贪污分子悔改自新起见，仍然根据不同情况特别是坦白悔改与否而采取不同的处理办法。像常玉麟、沐士杰、沈振寰，这样的贪污分子，我们对他们曾经做了许多的教育工作，但他们仍然不愿意向政府彻底坦白自己的犯罪行为，甚至敢于抗拒、阻挠、破坏运动的进行，因此，人民法院决定依法予以逮捕，并将加重惩办。”他号召一切贪污分子都要以邓文明等六个人为榜样，坦白自己的错误，揭发他人的错误。
    彻底坦白得到宽大处理的贪污分子贾鹤鸣、吴家麟、李恩贵在会上痛切地检讨自己过去的犯罪行为，向大家表示悔改的决心。李恩贵并以自身为例，劝告一切贪污走私分子彻底坦白，大胆检举，他说：
    “只有彻底坦白才是贪污走私分子唯一的出路。”
