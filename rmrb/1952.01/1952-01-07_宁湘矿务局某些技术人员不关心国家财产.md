    Some Technicians at the Ningxiang Mining Bureau Do Not Care About National Property
    To the Editor: Some engineers at the Ningxiang Mining Bureau have a hired-hand mentality and a purely technical viewpoint, leading to serious waste of national property. Employees throughout the bureau have exposed dozens of cases of waste, both large and small, with alarming amounts. For example, when veteran worker Long Yuncheng was working on the vibrating screen and funnel project, he had to rework it three times, twice because of the engineers' carelessness. This resulted in the loss of two iron plates (each weighing over 300 jin), over 170 jin of rivets, and dozens of man-days. Furthermore, in January 1951, when the Mining Bureau was quarrying stone, over 350 cubic meters of stone were rendered unusable due to the Planning Office section chief's failure to review the plan beforehand, wasting over ten million yuan. Some technicians do not delve into the root causes of this wasteful behavior from an ideological perspective, instead attributing it to objective reasons. For example, some say, "I admit there is waste, but the basic problem is that I lack experience." One chief engineer even said, "Our motives are good, but the results are not." In fact, based on the existing materials, the main reasons for the waste are that these technicians have a hired-hand mentality and a purely technical viewpoint, and do not care about the people's property. I believe the Mining Bureau should pay attention to conducting ideological remolding work for its technical personnel. Liu Liu

    宁湘矿务局某些技术人员不关心国家财产
    编辑同志：宁湘矿务局某些工程师有雇佣观点和纯技术观点，致使国家财产发生严重的浪费现象。全局职工已经揭发了大小浪费事件数十件，浪费的数目很惊人。比如，老工人龙云程在作振动筛和漏斗工程时，曾返工三次，其中两次都是因为工程师草率从事所致。这次共损失了二张铁板（每张重三百余斤），一百七十多斤铆钉，几十个人工。又如一九五一年一月，矿务局开采石头，因计划室科长事前不加审核，致开出的石头有三百五十方无法使用，浪费了一千多万元。某些技术人员对于这种浪费行为，不从思想上去挖根，而推到客观的原因上面。如有的说：“我承认浪费，但基本问题是我没有经验。”甚至有一个总工程师说：“我们的动机是好的，就是效果不好。”其实，根据现有材料来分析浪费的原因，主要是这些技术人员有雇佣观点和纯技术观点，不关心人民的财产。我认为矿务局应注意进行技术人员的思想改造工作。刘流
