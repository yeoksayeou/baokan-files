Song Degui, of vagrant origin, was captured from the Kuomintang army in 1935 and, after education, remained in the revolutionary ranks. In 1936, he infiltrated the Party, and in 1950 he was transferred to the Ministry of Public Security as the Director of the Administrative Office. Although he had undergone more than ten years of training during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Self-Defense, his bad qualities were not reformed. Under the influence of the bourgeoisie, his daily life was corrupt and he liked flattery. From April to September 1951, the Ministry of Public Security, in order to build houses, with the consent of relevant departments, sent him to Northeast China to purchase and transport timber. At this time, Song Degui met Zhao Xiqiao, the manager of the Tianjin Donghua Freight Yard, and hired Zhao Xiqiao and his partners to assist in inspecting and measuring materials. Under the bribery and collusion of unscrupulous merchants, he committed the serious crime of stealing state wealth.

Zhao Xiqiao was an extremely cunning merchant. He quickly found Song Degui's fatal weakness, invested in him, and conspired to steal state property through Song Degui's hands. He often invited Song Degui to dinner, flattered Song Degui in every possible way, calling Song Degui "Master Song" and shouting "Long live Song Degui." Under this kind of siege, Song Degui became even more unscrupulous and completely lost the qualities of a revolutionary. He praised Zhao Xiqiao as "capable" and said that they should be "generous economically," arbitrarily squandering the people's hard-earned money. He and Zhao Xiqiao stayed in the best hotels and ate the best banquets. In the Northeast, they spent hundreds of thousands of yuan per person per day for meals, and drank brandy with every meal. Banquets in Beijing cost over seven hundred thousand yuan per table.

After Song Degui became completely corrupt, he further colluded with unscrupulous merchants, embezzled and violated the law. He boldly stole state property of 700 million yuan by overpaying the Donghua Freight Yard for inspection and measurement fees. (Originally, according to the state-stipulated price, the Ministry of Public Security should only pay 500 million yuan in handling fees. However, Song Degui gave Donghua an extra 700 million yuan.) The unscrupulous merchant Zhao Xiqiao also evaded taxes, reporting only 420 million yuan in taxes, and the actual loss to the state exceeded 700 million yuan. In this way, Song Degui actually became the big boss of the Donghua Freight Yard. Zhao Xiqiao gave Song Degui money whenever he asked for it, and gave him things whenever he wanted them. The Donghua Freight Yard's employees called Song Degui "Old Manager."

In order to cover up his criminal behavior, Song Degui learned the merchant's method of bribery, using embezzled state property to give gifts to others and invite them to dinner. After returning from purchasing and transporting timber in the Northeast, he gave each of the staff members who participated in the timber purchase and transportation 600,000 yuan as "bonuses," and also gave other people watches, pens, canned goods, cigarettes, and so on. Therefore, Song Degui not only became a traitor to the Party and the people, but also corrupted revolutionary cadres, dragging a group of people with weak wills down with him. A large portion of the cadres under his leadership in the Administrative Office were not clean.

Under the repeated education of the Party and administrative leaders, Song Degui still did not repent of his serious criminal behavior, but instead planned to resist. After the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began, he secretly gathered with the unscrupulous merchant Zhao Xiqiao and the principal offenders in the same case, Liu Yuze and Wang Zhen, twice to discuss how to get through this hurdle.

Wang Zhen and Liu Yuze were both principal offenders in the collective embezzlement case headed by Song Degui. Wang Zhen was the Deputy Director of the Production Section of the Administrative Office. He went to the Northeast with Song Degui to purchase and transport timber, lived the same lewd and shameless life, stole state property, drank, bought ginseng, watches, gold rings, etc., trying to decorate himself like a decadent exploiting class. Liu Yuze was the Deputy Director of the Administrative Office. He was responsible for receiving and distributing timber in Beijing. He has confessed to embezzling 42.5 million yuan and buying a house in Chunshu Hutong, which was freshly painted by private merchants in collusion with him. This is where Liu Yuze hid his stolen goods. Recent inspections revealed that a large amount of cash, gold, silver dollars, gold rings, watches, cloth, cameras, and other valuables were hidden here. In addition, he also confessed to accepting bribes from private merchants twice, totaling 28 million yuan.

Currently, the Central Ministry of Public Security is conducting a tense investigation into this case. The leading comrades of the Central Ministry of Public Security and the负责人 (in charge persons) of the General Office have made self-criticisms and plan to convene a general meeting of all staff members to conduct a public trial after all the facts of the case are clarified, in order to further vigorously and deeply carry out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    宋德贵等贪污罪行
    宋德贵，游民出身，一九三五年从国民党军队里被我军俘掳过来后，经过教育，留在革命队伍里；一九三六年混入党内，一九五零年调到公安部任行政处处长。他在过去抗日战争、自卫战争时期，虽然受过十几年的锻炼，但恶劣品质并没有得到改造。他在资产阶级的引诱下，平日生活腐化，喜好奉承。一九五一年四月到九月，公安部为了修建房屋，商得有关部门同意，派他去东北购运木材。这时，宋德贵结识了天津东华货栈经理赵溪桥，雇用赵溪桥及其伙友十几个人协助验料、检尺。他在奸商的收买和勾结下，就犯了盗窃国家财富的严重罪行。
    赵溪桥是一个极端狡诈的奸商。他很快就找到了宋德贵的致命弱点，向他下本钱，阴谋通过宋德贵的手窃取国家财产。他经常请宋德贵吃饭，在宋德贵面前百般奉承，称宋德贵为“宋大人”，喊宋德贵“万岁”。宋德贵在这种包围下，就变本加厉，完完全全丧失了一个革命者的品质。他称赞赵溪桥“能干”，对他们“经济上要大方”，任意挥霍人民的血汗钱。他跟赵溪桥一起住最好的饭店，吃最好的酒席。在东北，每天每人都要花十几万元去吃饭，每顿都要喝白兰地酒。在北京举行宴会，一桌就是七十几万元。
    宋德贵腐化透顶后，进一步和奸商勾结，贪污违法。他用多付东华货栈验料、检尺的手续费的方式，大胆盗窃国家财产七亿元。（本来，按国家规定价格，公安部只应出五亿手续费。但宋德贵却多给了东华七亿元。）奸商赵溪桥又偷漏税款，只报了四亿二千万的税，国家实际的损失超过七亿元。这样，宋德贵就实际上成了东华货栈的大老板。赵溪桥对宋德贵，要钱就送钱，要东西就送东西。东华货栈的伙计称宋为“老掌柜”。
    宋德贵为了掩盖自己的犯罪行为，学会了商人行贿的办法，以盗用国家的财产给其他人送礼物，请吃饭。在东北购运木材回来后，他对参加购运木材的工作人员，每人送了六十万元作“奖金”，还给其他一些人送手表、钢笔、罐头、香烟等等。因此，宋德贵不仅自己成为党和人民的叛徒，而且还腐蚀革命干部，把一批意志薄弱的人拖下水去。在他领导下的行政处，很大一部分干部身上都不干净。
    在党和行政领导方面反复教育下，宋德贵对自己严重的犯罪行为，仍不悔悟，反而有计划地进行对抗。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开展起来后，他曾两次和奸商赵溪桥及同案主犯刘玉泽、王珍秘密集会，商讨怎样混过这一关。
    王珍和刘玉泽都是以宋德贵为首的集体贪污案的主犯。王珍是行政处生产科副科长，跟宋德贵一道去东北购运木材，一起过着同样荒淫无耻的生活，盗窃国家的财产，喝花酒，买人参、手表、金戒指等等，企图把自己装饰得像个腐朽的剥削阶级的样子。刘玉泽是行政处副处长，他在北京负责接收、分配木材，自己已供认曾分赃四千二百五十万元，在椿树胡同买了一所房子，跟他勾结的私商替他油饰一新。这是刘玉泽窝藏赃物的场所。最近检查中，发现这里藏有大量现款、黄金、银元、金戒指、手表、布匹、照像机等贵重财物多种。此外，他还供认收受私商贿赂两次共二千八百万元。
    现在，中央公安部正紧张地清查这个案子。对于这些盗窃国家财产的重大贪污罪犯，中央公安部领导同志和办公厅的负责人，已作了检讨，并计划在全部案情弄清后，召开全体工作人员大会进行公审，进一步大张旗鼓地把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争更加深入地开展起来。
