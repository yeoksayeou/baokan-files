Beijing State-Owned Factories and Enterprises
Concentrate Efforts to Capture Major Embezzlers
Three Factories Have Already Caught Seven Major Embezzlers, With Embezzled Sums Exceeding 100 Million Yuan Each

    Workers in Beijing's state-owned factories and enterprises are concentrating their efforts on capturing major embezzlers. Three factories have already caught seven major embezzlers. Some of these seven major embezzlers are capitalists who infiltrated state-owned enterprises, while others accepted bribes from capitalists and helped them steal state wealth within state-owned enterprises, thus effectively becoming agents of the capitalists.

    Wang Zhenou, Deputy Director of the General Management Office of Xinhua Printing Factory, was originally a capitalist from Shanghai. After infiltrating the Xinhua Printing Factory, he used his position to steal huge amounts of state property. Based on his initial confession alone, he embezzled 100.2 million yuan by falsely claiming tax rebates when purchasing steel bars in Shanghai during the construction of the Xinhua Printing Factory in 1950. After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Wang Zhenou pretended to be active and even infiltrated the Xinhua Printing Factory's Savings Inspection Committee in an attempt to conceal his crimes. It was only recently, when the factory concentrated its efforts on capturing major embezzlers, that he initially admitted his embezzlement crimes. The leadership of the Xinhua Printing Factory has now removed Wang Zhenou from his post and ordered him to continue to confess his embezzlement facts. Wang Huatang, the former head of the Construction and Repair Section of the General Affairs Department of the People's Printing Factory, consistently used his position to protect private merchants who cut corners and used inferior materials, accepting bribes from them. According to the materials he has already confessed, he accepted bribes totaling over 110 million yuan. Wang Huatang colluded with private merchants, allowing them to cut corners and use inferior materials, which is preliminarily estimated to have caused the state a loss of at least 200 million yuan. Jin Xiangzhi, head of the Waste Management Section, frequently sold factory waste materials at low prices in exchange for bribes from unscrupulous merchants, and has admitted to embezzling over 100 million yuan. Song Enming, head of the Repair and Manufacturing Section of the Machine Affairs Department, engaged in fraudulent practices, passing off substandard goods as good ones, and has admitted to embezzling over 160 million yuan. Zhu Xiushan, head of the Supply and Sales Section, and Sun Zhili, a purchasing agent, of the General Factory of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, engaged in fraudulent practices when purchasing equipment and materials. According to the materials they have already confessed, one embezzled 140 million yuan and the other embezzled 120 million yuan. Guan Wenjun, Section Chief of the Management Section of the First Branch Factory of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, colluded with private merchants to steal state wealth. Under his protection, private merchants even used the money from public orders to hoard and speculate, failing to deliver goods for a long time. The six contracts he signed with private merchants were subject to fines totaling over 800 million yuan due to delayed delivery; however, under his protection, not a single penny was fined, causing the state serious losses. According to his initial confession of embezzlement crimes, he has admitted to accepting bribes of 100.2 million yuan. He also used the embezzled funds to invest 60 million yuan in a private factory. In reality, he has become a capitalist agent within a state-owned enterprise.

    北京国营各大工厂企业
    集中全力捕捉大贪污犯
    已有三个工厂捉到七个大贪污犯，贪污数目都在一亿元以上
    北京国营各大工厂企业职工集中全力捕捉大贪污犯，已有三个工厂捉到大贪污犯七个。这七个大贪污犯，有的是混进国营企业中的资本家，有的是接受资本家的贿赂，帮助资本家在国营企业内盗窃国家财富，因而实际上已成为资本家的代理人。
    新华印刷厂总管理处办公室副主任王震欧，原是上海资本家；他混进新华印刷厂后，利用职权盗窃国家巨额财产。仅根据他头一次坦白的材料，在一九五零年新华印刷厂建筑厂房时，他就趁到上海买钢筋的机会，从中冒领税款，贪污一亿零二百万元。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，王震欧假装积极，并钻到新华印刷厂节约检查委员会里来，企图隐瞒罪行。直到最近该厂集中全力捕捉大贪污犯时，他才初步承认了他的贪污罪行。现在新华印刷厂领导方面已撤销王震欧的职务，令他继续交代贪污事实。人民印刷厂前任总务科营缮股股长王画堂，一贯利用职权包庇私商偷工减料，从中接受私商贿赂。根据他已经承认的材料，他前后受贿一亿一千多万元。王画堂勾结私商，让私商偷工减料，据初步估计，至少使国家损失两亿元。废料管理科科长金相枝，经常用低价出卖厂内废料，换取奸商贿赂，已经承认贪污款项一亿多元。机务科修造股股长宋恩铭营私舞弊，用次货充当好货，已承认先后贪污一亿六千多万元。华北农业机械厂总厂供销股股长朱秀山、采购员孙致利，在采购器材时营私舞弊。根据他们所已经承认的材料，一个贪污了一亿四千万元，一个贪污了一亿二千万元。华北农业机械厂第一分厂经理科长关文俊，伙通私商，盗窃国家财富。在他的包庇下，私商竟拿公家定货的钱去囤积倒把，长期不交货。他和私商订立的六份合同，由于交货误期，一共该罚私商八亿元以上；可是在他的包庇下，竟一个钱也没有罚，使国家受到严重损失。根据他初步交代的贪污罪行，已承认受贿一亿零二百万元。他并用贪污所得的款项在一家私营工厂里入了六千万元的股。实际上，他已经是资本家在国营企业里的代理人了。
