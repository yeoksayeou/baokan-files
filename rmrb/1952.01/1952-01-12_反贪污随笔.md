    "Touching" the Tiger's Butt
    Are tigers formidable or not? To say they are not, there are indeed those who turn pale at the mention of a tiger, let alone "touching" its butt. In the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement, some people are like this.
    Are tigers really that scary? Not really. As described in the Water Margin, they only have the skills of pouncing, brushing, and clipping. The problem is that you only dare to "touch" its butt once, and quickly withdraw your hand after "touching" it, or you don't even dare to "touch" it at all. This will inevitably increase the tiger's power and make it dare to bite people. The way to deal with tigers is to "hit" them, not to "touch" them in a way that is neither painful nor itchy. You must have the courage of Wu Song fighting the tiger, and then you won't have to worry about it not being tamed.
    So what is truly formidable is Wu Song's courage in fighting the tiger, Wu Song's fists. This courage comes from a firm class stance and a high degree of adherence to principles; the fists are the weapons of criticism and self-criticism. In a word, what is truly invincible is the truth, not the tiger.

    What for?
    In the anti-corruption movement, it is said that some people are "afraid of returning the stolen goods" and dare not confess. The minds of these people are completely buried in the money pit.
    The reasons for this are nothing more than two: one is that he joined the revolution just to use the guise of revolution to get promoted and make a fortune. If he can't make a fortune, and even has to lose his "official" position, he is naturally afraid. The other is that he originally came for the revolution, but could not withstand the influence of bourgeois ideology, pursued a corrupt and hedonistic life, became greedy at the sight of money, lost his original nature, and forgot what he came for. As if his original participation in the revolution was not to serve the people, but for money, for a bribed watch, for this and that.
    What exactly did you come for? This is something that must be seriously clarified. The first type of person is a careerist and must be purged. The second type of person must be given a wake-up call, let them wake up, climb out of the money pit, wash away the smell of money, and clarify what they came for.

    Catching Lice or Boiling Them?
    In a guerrilla warfare environment, most people have lice on their bodies. Lazy people don't catch them, and mock themselves by saying: "Many lice don't itch"; some catch them occasionally, but because they leave the lice's offspring, they still bite. Some people think of a way to put their clothes in a pot of boiling water to cook, which can eradicate them completely.
    In the past, when we treated corruption, some bureaucratic lazy people did think that "many lice don't itch"; some also handled a few corrupt elements, but only dealt with the matter as it stood, and judged the case as it was, without realizing the danger of lice sucking blood and spreading poison, so corrupt elements continued to emerge; now it is indeed time to put the clothes in a pot of boiling water and boil them.
    Corruption and waste must be eradicated completely. These various acts of theft suck the blood of the country and the people, and will inevitably make the country weak and unable to carry out large-scale construction. A lot of useful money has been embezzled, wasted, or illegally and undisciplined by localismists, enriching the small public at the expense of the large public, and dividing and occupying it, so that the country cannot concentrate this money to carry out construction projects that benefit the 500 million people. If we don't wake up, we will become criminals of the country and the people.
    To eliminate corruption and waste, we can only deal with lice like that, put the clothes in a pot of boiling water to cook, and scald all the lice and lice offspring to death. What is the boiling water? It is a widespread and boiling mass movement. When the masses are mobilized, there is no need to worry about the lice not dying.

    反贪污随笔
    张致祥
    “摸”老虎屁股
    老虎厉害不厉害？要说不厉害，但确有人谈虎色变，更不用说去“摸”老虎屁股了。反贪污浪费运动中，有的人就是这样的。
    老虎真厉害吗？并不厉害。如水浒传所说，不过只是一扑、一拂、一剪的本事。问题在于你只敢“摸”它屁股一下，“摸”了又赶快缩了手，或者连“摸”都不敢“摸”，这样必然长老虎的威风，使它敢于咬人。对付老虎的办法，要“打”，而不是不痛不痒地“摸”，要拿出武松打虎的勇气来，就不愁它不驯服。
    所以真正厉害的，是武松打虎的勇气，是武松的拳头。这种勇气，就是来自坚定的阶级立场，和高度的原则性；拳头，就是批评自我批评的武器。一句话，真正无敌的，是真理，而不是老虎。
    所为何来
    在反贪污运动中，据说有人“怕退赃”，不敢坦白。这种人的思想，已经完全钻到钱窟窿里去了。
    所以这样，原因不外两种：一种是他参加革命，就是为了借革命的幌子，升官发财。发不了财，还要丢“官”，自然怕。一种是原为革命来的，但经不起资产阶级思想的影响，追求腐化的享乐生活，见钱眼开，迷了本性，忘记了所为何来。仿佛当初他之参加革命，不是为了为人民服务，而是为了钱，为了一块受贿的表，为了这个、那个似的。
    究竟自己所为何来？这是必须认真弄清楚的。第一种人，是投机分子，要清洗出去。第二种人，要向他们敲响警钟，让他们醒过来，从钱窟窿中爬出来，洗清铜臭，弄清究竟所为何来。
    捉虱子，还是下锅煮
    游击战争环境中，大多数人身上有虱子。懒人不捉，并自嘲说：“虱多不痒”；有的偶而捉一下，因为留了虱崽子，还是咬。有的人想个办法，把衣服放到开水锅里煮一煮，可以绝根。
    我们过去对待贪污现象，有些官僚主义懒汉，确实认为“虱多不痒”；有的也办了几个贪污分子，也只是就事论事，就案判案，没有认识到虱子吸血和传染毒害的危险性，所以贪污分子仍不断产生；现在确实已到把衣服放到开水锅里煮一下的时候了。
    对于贪污浪费现象，一定要铲除净尽。这各色各样的盗窃行为，吸国家和人民的血，必使国家四肢无力，没有办法进行大规模的建设。许多有用的钱被贪污了，浪费了，或被本位主义者违法犯纪，肥小公损大公，分散霸占起来，这样就使国家不能集中这些钱，去进行对五万万人民有利的建设事业。我们再不觉悟，就将成为国家和人民的罪人。
    要除尽贪污浪费现象，只有像对付虱子那样，把衣服下开水锅去煮，把一切虱子、虱崽子都烫死。开水是什么呢？就是广泛的沸腾的群众运动。群众发动起来，是不愁虱子不死的。
