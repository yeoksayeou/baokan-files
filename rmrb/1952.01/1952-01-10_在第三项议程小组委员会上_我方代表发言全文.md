Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 9th:

    The following is the full text of the speech delivered by our representative at the Third Agenda Subcommittee of the Korean Armistice Negotiations today:

    When your side presented a counterproposal on December 29, 1951, to our four, five, and six principles proposal put forward on December 24, I stated our attitude towards your counterproposal at that time. I pointed out that in the preamble to your fourth principle proposal, you removed the phrase "to facilitate the holding of a higher-level political conference between the two sides," which you had already agreed to, and replaced it with "to facilitate political personnel taking action to achieve a peaceful resolution," which is inappropriate. Changing the main clause of our fourth principle, "No military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition shall enter Korea from outside Korea," to "No reinforcing military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition shall enter Korea from outside Korea," contains your intention to continue bringing in supplementary war equipment from outside Korea during the armistice period, which is not as thorough and easy to implement as our principle. And what is especially intolerable is that your counterproposal still retains the unreasonable demand for restricting airport equipment in the fourth principle proposal, which interferes in our internal affairs. In the past few days of meetings, I have repeatedly stated that our side absolutely cannot consider this unreasonable demand that interferes in our internal affairs. It is the main stumbling block hindering the progress of the meeting. This stumbling block was brought by your side and deliberately placed here. If the purpose you are pursuing in this meeting is truly, as you have repeatedly stated, to seek a stable armistice, our side sees no reason why, in the overall adjustment, your side still insists on this demand that hinders the progress of the meeting.

    In the spirit of reaching an agreement quickly, I now present the full text of our amendment to your proposal of December 29, 1951 (the plan is in another telegram). As you can see now, apart from the one interfering with our internal affairs that our side absolutely cannot agree to, in the few amendments our side has made to your proposal, regarding the preamble of the fourth principle, our side agrees with the purpose of the meeting indicated in your text—the proposition of a peaceful resolution; regarding the main clause of the fourth principle, our side agrees with your formulation, that is, making a concession to your repeatedly insisted proposition of necessary war equipment replacement during the armistice period. It should be pointed out that since our side put forward the two supplementary suggestions on December 3, 1951, your side has continuously insisted on the demands for rotation and replenishment during the armistice period, which have now been fully and reasonably resolved through our efforts. In addition, our side still insists on retaining the term "neutral nations" instead of the term "non-combatant nations" that you proposed, but at the same time, our side adopts your definition of the connotation of neutral nations used at the beginning of the sixth principle, so it can be seen that there is no difference between us on the substance of this issue.

    Our amendment deletes the part of your proposal regarding the restriction of airport construction. Our side absolutely cannot agree to any unreasonable demands that interfere in our internal affairs. I have stated countless times in this meeting that whether or not the two sides carry out this or that kind of facility within Korea during the armistice period is entirely within the scope of the internal affairs of both sides, and the military armistice negotiations have no right to interfere, nor are they allowed to interfere. You cannot deny that restricting the right of both sides to handle their facilities within Korea during the armistice period is an interference in the internal affairs of both sides. But you say that you are now carrying out this kind of interference with your military force, so you still want to continue interfering in our internal affairs during the armistice period. Your theory of warmongers, dripping with blood, is absurd to the point of not being worth refuting. You should know that even when you use military force to recklessly bomb and destroy, you cannot interfere in our internal affairs. But you are trying to achieve through negotiation what you cannot achieve with military force. I frankly tell you, you will never get what you cannot get with military force.

    When your absurd argument doesn't hold water, you bring up another absurd argument. You say that there is no complete sovereignty in the world now; since complete sovereignty does not exist, why bother so much about the integrity of sovereignty and the non-interference in national internal affairs? This sentence is a naked expression of the ambition of your American ruling clique to dominate the world. You attempt to invade all countries in the world, therefore, you deny that all countries in the world have any sovereignty. Indeed, in your aggressive camp, many countries, under your American oppression, no longer have their complete sovereignty. But don't forget: your attempt to dominate the world has run into walls in many places in this world, because in these places there are not only countries with complete sovereignty, but also some countries that have taken up arms to defend their sovereignty and oppose foreign interference. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is such a country. We will never accept your unreasonable demands that interfere in our internal affairs. You say we should forget about the fragmented terms of sovereignty and internal affairs, but I want to remind you that there are hundreds of millions of people all over the world who are fighting for the integrity of their national sovereignty and the independence of their internal affairs!

    Based on this absurd argument, you go a step further, saying that an armistice always requires giving up part of sovereignty, and even saying that since our side has agreed to guarantee that no military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition shall enter Korea from outside Korea, and to invite representatives of neutral countries to conduct inspections at the rear ports agreed upon by both sides, it has in fact agreed to your interference in our internal affairs. Your absurd reasoning deliberately obliterates the fact that restricting the entry of any military force from outside Korea, and having neutral countries not involved in the Korean War conduct supervision, is in itself a restriction of foreign forces from interfering in Korea's internal affairs. Our suggestion strictly divides Korea's foreign relations and internal affairs, and is the only possible way to ensure a stable military armistice without involving the internal affairs of both sides.

    You cannot use reasoning to prove the legitimacy of your demand to interfere in our internal affairs, so you adopt another method, falsely accusing our side of rejecting your unreasonable demand to interfere in our internal affairs, which means that our side intends to use the armistice to strengthen our air force strength without restriction, in order to launch a blitz against your side and threaten the safety of your troops. I have stated countless times in this meeting that our side cannot agree to your suggestion to restrict airport equipment because it is a matter of internal affairs. You think that the two sides can carry out limited restoration of civilian airports during the armistice period as a concession to our side, but your thinking is completely off the mark. What we absolutely cannot concede on this issue is the non-interference in our internal affairs, as for whether or not our side carries out this or that kind of facility, it is another matter. I think I cannot say it any clearer on this issue. Can it be said that since our side opposes your suggestion to restrict airport equipment, it shows that our side will use the armistice to develop our air force strength without restriction in order to launch a blitz against your side? Saying this is either intentionally distorting or deliberately undermining the armistice negotiations. In order to ensure the stability of the military armistice, our side has suggested that no combat aircraft shall enter Korea from outside Korea, and on the issue of supervision, agrees that as long as either side in the Military Armistice Commission requests the neutral nations supervisory机构 to investigate incidents of violation of the armistice agreement, the neutral nations supervisory机构 shall be responsible for conducting inspections, to show that our side not only advocates that no combat aircraft shall enter Korea from outside Korea during the armistice period, but also agrees to use your method to ensure the implementation of the above suggestion. Since no combat aircraft will enter Korea from outside Korea, it is impossible for both sides to develop air force strength without restriction during the armistice period, is this not an extremely clear principle?

    You have repeatedly stated in this meeting that your side has conceded four and a half demands in ensuring the stability of the armistice situation, implying that your side can no longer make concessions and that our side should make some concessions. We believe that agreements should be reached on a fair and reasonable basis, not on the issue of who makes more concessions, especially not to measure concessions with the many unreasonable demands that your side has made. Since the beginning of the negotiations, your side has been acting as a victor. When your side realizes that our side will never agree to your demand to act as a victor and has to accept fair and reasonable conditions against your will, you say that your side has made great concessions, but in fact your side has not made any significant concessions. Those unreasonable demands that you have made and later had to give up should not have been made in the first place. I have seen in your news that your agreement to use the existing battle line as the military demarcation line is a major concession on your part, but how can this be a concession? What concessions have you made by halting in place and retreating two kilometers to establish a demilitarized zone? But compared with the unreasonable demand you made on July 27, 1951, to advance more than 10,000 square kilometers into our positions, your side seems to have made a major concession. The past situation was like this, and the present situation is also like this. When discussing the third agenda item, your side initially put forward a series of unreasonable demands. You demand to freely inspect and conduct aerial patrols directly in our rear areas during the armistice period, don't you think about how our side can accept your unreasonable demand? But when your demands cannot be met under our firm opposition and you have to express your abandonment, you say that you have made major concessions, but how can this be a major concession?

    The truth of the matter will never be changed by your distorted propaganda. In order to explain how the agreements we have reached were reached and where the crux of the parts that have not yet been agreed upon lies, I feel it is necessary to review the development of the discussion of the third agenda item. In order to ensure that no further hostilities occur in Korea after the armistice and to lay the foundation for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, our side has consistently advocated that the withdrawal of all foreign troops and their equipment from Korea should be discussed and resolved in the Korean military armistice negotiations. But at that time, your side firmly refused to discuss this fundamental issue on the grounds that military armistice negotiations should not involve political issues. Although everyone knows that the issue of withdrawing foreign troops is not a political issue, your side's opposition to the discussion is unreasonable. But in order to satisfy the universal peaceful desire of the people of the world to stop the Korean War first, our side agreed to leave the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops and their equipment from Korea to a higher-level political conference between the two sides for discussion, and to limit the Korean military armistice negotiations to a strictly military scope. Since both sides agreed that after the realization of the armistice in Korea, a higher-level political conference between the two sides should be convened quickly to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops and their equipment from Korea in order to completely and peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and the Korean military armistice is only a transitional state, our side believes that there is no need to discuss such broad issues as restricting both sides from increasing military strength when entering the third agenda item, therefore our side put forward a five-point principle for realizing a simple military armistice. But your side reversed its past position that military negotiations should not involve political issues, insisted on discussing such broad issues as restricting both sides' military strength and conducting inspections in both sides' rear areas, therefore the third agenda item fell into a serious stalemate shortly after the start of the discussion. Once again, in order to satisfy the universal peaceful desire of the people of the world to stop the Korean War first, our side proposed that in order to ensure the stability of the military armistice and to facilitate the holding of a higher-level political conference between the two sides, both sides guarantee not to enter any armed forces and war equipment from outside Korea under any pretext, including combat aircraft, and suggested that representatives of neutral nations conduct inspections at the rear ports agreed upon by both sides. Any impartial person can see that these two supplementary suggestions of our side are absolutely fair and reasonable, and there is nothing that can be criticized. But your side insisted on carrying out rotation and replenishment during the armistice period, and insisted on the unreasonable demand to restrict airport equipment that interferes in our internal affairs. In order to break the deadlock and quickly realize the armistice in Korea, our side agreed to your side's request on the issue of rotation, and explicitly stipulated in the fourth principle proposed by our side that both sides guarantee not to enter any combat aircraft from outside Korea during the armistice period, and at the same time agreed on the issue of supervision that when either side in the Military Armistice Commission requests the neutral nations supervisory 机构 to investigate incidents of violation of the armistice agreement, the neutral nations supervisory 机构 shall be responsible for conducting inspections to ensure the stability of the armistice situation. And in our current amendment, our side has again agreed to your side's request for necessary war equipment replacement during the armistice period within a reasonable scope. All fair and impartial people in the world can see the great efforts made by our side to seek the realization of the armistice in Korea, as shown in the above series of specific suggestions. Our sincerity and goodwill can never be concealed by any fabrication and slander you have made in this tent. But on the other hand, if your side regards our efforts to achieve the armistice as a sign of weakness, you are wrong. Any demand involving interference in our internal affairs is absolutely unacceptable. This is our unwavering, I repeat, unwavering position.

    在第三项议程小组委员会上
    我方代表发言全文
    【新华社开城九日电】本日我方代表在朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程小组委员会上发言全文：
    当你方在一九五一年十二月二十九日对我方在十二月二十四日提出的四、五、六三条原则建议提出对案时，我当时即已表明我方对你方对案的态度。我指出在你方对案中，你方在第四条原则建议的前言中，取消你方业已同意了的“以利于双方高一级的政治会议的进行”，而代之以“以利于政治人员采取行动达到和平解决”一语，是不妥当的。将我方第四条原则主句“不从朝鲜境外进入任何军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药”，改为“不从朝鲜境外进入任何增援的军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药”，包藏着你方一直坚持的在停战期间继续从朝鲜境外进入补充的战争装备的用意，不如我方原则之彻底和易行。而尤其不能容忍的是：你方对案在第四条原则建议中，依然保留着干涉我方内政的限制机场设备的无理要求。在过去几天会议中，我已反复说明这个干涉我方内政的无理要求，我方绝对不能考虑。它是阻碍会议进展的主要绊脚石。这个绊脚石是你方搬来，并且故意把它放在这里的。假使你方在这个会议中所追求的目的真正是像你所一再说明的，在于求得一个稳定的停战，我方看不出有什么理由在全盘的调整中，你方仍然坚持这个阻碍会议进展的要求。
    本着迅速达成协议的精神，我现在提出我方对于你方一九五一年十二月二十九日建议的修正案全文（方案见另电）。你现在看到，除掉上述我方所绝对不能同意的干涉我方内政的一条外，在我方对你方建议所作的少数修正中，关于第四条原则的前言部分，我方同意了你方条文中标明的会议的目的——和平解决的主张，关于第四条原则的主句，我方同意你方的提法，也就是对你方所一再坚持的在停战期间进行必要的战争装备的替换的主张作了让步。应该指出：自从我方提出一九五一年十二月三日两项补充建议时起，你方就不断坚持的在停战期间继续进行轮换与补充的要求，由于我方的努力，到此已全部得到合理的解决。此外，我方仍然主张保留中立国一词，而不用你方所提出的非战斗国一词，但同时我方则采纳了你方在第六条原则开头处所用的对于中立国的涵意的规定，可见对于这个问题的实质，我们之间并无分歧。
    我方修正案删去了你方建议中关于限制机场修建的那一部分。我方绝对不能同意任何干涉我方内政的无理要求。我在这一个会上，已无数次地阐明了停战期间双方在朝鲜境内进行或者不进行这一种或者那一种设备，完全是属于双方内政范围内的事，军事停战谈判无权过问，也不容许过问。你不能否认停战期间限制双方在朝鲜境内处理其设备之权，是对于双方内政的干涉。但你说这种干涉现在你们就以你们的军事力量在进行着，因此你们在停战期间仍然要继续干涉我方内政。你这种血腥逼人的好战分子的理论是荒谬到不值一驳的。你们应该知道，即在你们使用军事力量狂轰滥炸、大肆破坏的时候，你们也不能干涉我方的内政。但你们不能使用军事力量得到的东西，你们却企图用谈判的方法来达到。我坦白地告诉你们，你们也永远不会得到你们用军事力量所得不到的东西。
    你们这个荒谬的论点说不通，你们又搬来另外一个荒谬的论点。你们说现在的世界上已经没有完整的主权；完整的主权既不存在，又何必斤斤计较于主权的完整和国家内政的不可干涉呢？这句话正是你们美国统治集团企图称霸世界的野心的露骨表现。你们企图侵略世界上的一切国家，因此，你们就否认世界各国还有什么主权。诚然，在你们侵略阵营里，有许多国家在你们美国压迫之下，已经没有他们完整的主权了。但是你们不要忘记：你们这种称霸世界的妄图已经在这个世界不少地方碰了壁，因为在这些地方不仅有主权完整的国家，而且有些国家还拿起武器为保卫自己的主权和反对外来干涉而斗争。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国就是这样一个国家。我们是绝不会接受你们干涉我方内政的无理要求的。你们说我们应该忘记主权内政那些支离破碎的名词，但我要提醒你们，全世界正有着几万万人民，为他们国家的主权完整和内政独立而斗争呢！
    你们根据这个荒谬的论点又前进了一步，说什么停战总是要放弃一部分主权的，甚而至于说我方既然同意保证不从朝鲜境外进入任何军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药，并邀请中立国国家的代表到双方同意的后方口岸进行视察，事实上就已经同意了你方对我方内政的干涉。你们这种荒谬的推理，是故意地抹煞这样的事实：限制从朝鲜境外进入任何军事力量，并由与朝鲜战争无关的中立国来进行监察，这件事的本身就是限制外来力量干涉朝鲜的内政。我们这个建议是严格地划分了朝鲜的对外关系与内政事务，并且是既能保证稳定的军事停战而又不涉及双方内政问题的唯一可能的办法。
    你们不能用说理来证明你方干涉我方内政要求的正当性，你们就采取另外一个方法，诬指我方拒绝你方干涉我方内政的无理要求，就是表示我方企图利用停战无限制地加强我方空军力量，以便向你方发动闪击，威胁你方部队的安全。我在这一个会上已经无数次地说明了我方不能同意你方限制机场设备的建议，是因为这是一个内政问题。你们以为双方可在停战期间进行有限制的民用机场的修复是对我方的一个让步，其实你们的想法完全是驴头不对马嘴。我们在这个问题上所绝不能让步的是我方内政的不受干涉，至于我方进行或者不进行这一种或者那一种设备，则是另外一个问题。我想我在这一个问题上，不能说得再清楚了。能不能说我方既然反对你方限制机场设备的建议，就表明我方将利用停战来无限制地发展我方空军力量，以便对你方发动闪击呢？这样说，如非有意曲解，就是存心破坏停战谈判。为了保证军事停战的稳定，我方已经建议不从朝鲜境外进入任何作战飞机，并在监察问题上，同意只要军事停战委员会中的双方或一方向中立国监察机构提出调查违反停战协议事件的请求时，中立国监察机构即应负责进行视察，以表示我方不仅主张在停战期间不从朝鲜境外进入任何作战飞机，而且同意用你方这种办法来保证上述建议的实施。既然不从朝鲜境外进入任何作战飞机，双方就不可能在停战期间无限制地发展空军力量，这难道不是极其明白的道理么？
    你在这个会上，曾多次说明你方在保证停战局势的稳定上已让出四个半要求了，言下你方已不能再让步，应该是我方有所让步了。我们认为协议应该在公平合理的基础上达成，而不是谁让步多少的问题，尤其是不能以你方曾经提出过的许多无理的要求来作让步的衡量。从谈判开始以来，你方就是以战胜者自居的。当你方发觉我方绝不会同意你方以战胜者自居的要求而不得不违背你方的意愿接受公平合理的条件时，你们就说你方是做了很大的让步，其实你方并没有作过什么重大让步。你们曾经提出过而后来又必须让掉的那些无理要求，是根本就不应该提出的。我曾看见你们的新闻上说你们同意以现有战线为军事分界线是你方的重大让步，其实这何尝是什么让步呢？就地停战各退二公里以建立非军事区，你们究竟作了什么让步呢？但以之与一九五一年七月二十七日你方提出的深入我方阵地一万多平方公里的军事分界线的无理要求相比较，你方好像是作了重大让步似的。过去的情况是如此，现在的情况也是如此。在讨论第三项议程时，你方一开始就提出了一系列的无理要求。你们要求在停战期间直接到我方的后方来自由视察和空中巡逻，你们就不想一想我方如何能接受你方这种无理的要求呢？但当你们的要求在我方的坚决反对之下不能得到而不能不表示放弃时，你们就说你们做了重大的让步，其实这何尝是什么重大让步呢？
    事情的真相绝不会因为你方的歪曲宣传而改变的，为了说明我们已经达成的协议是如何达成的，尚未达成协议部分的症结究竟在那里，我觉得有必要回顾一下第三项议程讨论发展的经过。为了保证朝鲜在停战后不再发生敌对行为，并打下和平解决朝鲜问题的基础，我方一贯主张在朝鲜的军事停战谈判中，就应该讨论并解决从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及其装备的问题。但那时你方以军事停战谈判不应涉及政治问题为理由，坚决拒绝讨论这一根本问题。虽然谁都知道撤退外国军队问题不是什么政治问题，你方的反对讨论是毫无理由的。但为了满足世界人民要求先把朝鲜战争停下来的普遍和平愿望，我方乃同意把从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及其装备的问题，留交双方高一级的政治会议去讨论，而将朝鲜的军事停战谈判限制于严格的军事范围。既然双方同意在朝鲜停战实现后，应该迅速召开双方高一级的政治会议，讨论从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及其装备，以彻底和平解决朝鲜问题，而朝鲜的军事停战只是一个过渡状态，我方认为完全没有必要在进入到第三项议程时，讨论限制双方增加军事力量那样广泛的问题，因此我方提出了一个实现单纯军事停战的五项原则。但你方一反过去军事谈判不应涉及政治问题的立场，坚持讨论限制双方军力及到双方后方进行视察的那样广泛的问题，因此第三项议程开始讨论不久，就陷入了严重的僵局。再一次为了满足世界人民要求先把朝鲜战争停下来的普遍的和平愿望，我方又提出为保证军事停战的稳定，以利于双方高一级的政治会议的进行，双方保证不得以任何藉口从朝鲜境外进入任何武装部队与战争装备，包含作战飞机在内，并建议由中立国代表在双方同意的后方口岸，进行视察。任何一个公正的人，都可以看出我方这两项补充建议是绝对公平合理，没有一点是可以非议的。但你方又坚持在停战期间必须进行轮换与补充，并坚持限制机场设备的干涉我方内政的无理要求。我方为了打开僵局以迅速实现朝鲜的停战，在轮换问题上同意了你方的要求，并在我方提出的第四条原则中，明文订出双方保证在停战期间不从朝鲜境外进入任何作战飞机，同时在监察问题上同意军事停战委员会中双方或一方向中立国监察机构提出调查违反停战协议事件的请求时，中立国监察机构即应负责进行视察以保证停战局势的稳定。而在现在我方的这个修正案中，我方又在合理范围内同意了你方在停战期间进行必要的战争装备的替换的要求。全世界一切公正无私的人士，都能看出在上述一系列具体建议中所表现出来的我方为求得朝鲜停战的实现而作的巨大努力。我方的诚意与善意绝不是你在这个帐篷里所作的任何捏造与诬蔑所可掩盖的。但另一方面，假使你方把我方为了达成停战所作的努力当作软弱的表示，你们就错了。任何涉及干涉我方内政的要求是绝对不能容许的。这是我方不可动摇的，我重复，不可动摇的立场。
