    Liu Jianhui, Heroine in Caring for the Wounded
    Liu Jianhui, one of the female representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's returning delegation, is a cultural instructor in a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, but she is also a heroine in caring for the wounded. In November 1950, she first took on the work of caring for the wounded. One day, the ward where she was stationed was bombed and strafed by American planes. There were eleven seriously wounded soldiers in the ward who could not move. Bombs exploded nearby, and machine guns swept across the roof and the courtyard. The chimney was knocked over, and dust fell from the damaged roof. At this time, Liu Jianhui was still calmly doing her job, taking care of their bowel movements and urination, and comforting the wounded, saying, "Comrades, as long as I am here, you are here." Enemy planes harassed the area all day, and Liu Jianhui never left the ward for a moment.
    This steel-willed heroine was a lively middle school student before going abroad. She encountered the test of marching continuously for eleven days upon her arrival in Korea. She had to walk ninety li (45km) every day. Her soles cracked, but she endured the pain without telling anyone. She followed everyone in taking off her cotton trousers and wading across the icy river. When the pain became unbearable, she would secretly get up at night to heat water to soak her feet, or put some rice paste on the cracks to relieve the pain. During the forced march, she sometimes had to walk 138 li (69km). She would rather throw away her own clothes and bedding than carry forty jin (20kg) of grain. She said, "Throwing away clothes means only I will be cold; carrying more rice allows everyone to eat their fill, and this is for victory."
    After taking on the nursing work, she treated the wounded as her own brothers, caring for them with meticulous attention. For example, in early January 1951, during the severe cold season in Korea, she was taking care of the wounded in a certain place. The ward was very small, and she was afraid of crowding the wounded, so she could not sit in the ward. Because she was too tired from work, she did not dare go to the landlord's room, because she would doze off as soon as she entered the warm room. So, she sat guarding the entrance of the ward in the cold wind, persisting like this for five consecutive nights. (Attached picture)

### 护理伤员的功臣刘剑辉

    护理伤员的功臣刘剑辉
    志愿军归国代表团的女代表之一刘剑辉，是志愿军某部的文化教员，可是她却是一位护理伤员的功臣。一九五○年十一月，她初次接受了护理伤员的工作。有一天，她的病房驻地遭受美国飞机的轰炸扫射，病房里有十一名不能移动的重伤员。炸弹在附近轰隆爆炸，机关枪扫过屋顶和院子，烟囱被打翻了，尘土从被打坏的屋顶上落下来。这时，刘剑辉还在镇静地做着她的工作，一面接大小便，一面安慰伤员说：“同志，有我在，就有你在。”敌机在这儿骚扰了一整天，刘剑辉一刻也没离开病房。
    这位坚如钢铁的女英雄，出国以前还是一个跳跳蹦蹦的中学生。初到朝鲜就遇上连续行军十一天的考验。每天要走九十里路。他的脚板走裂了，她忍着痛不叫别人知道，还跟着大家脱下棉裤淌着结了冰的水过河。实在痛得支持不住时，她晚上偷偷地起来烧热水把脚烫一烫，或者弄些饭贴在裂口上减轻一些痛苦。在急行军中，最多时要走一百三十八里路，她宁愿扔下自己的衣被，还要背着四十斤重的粮食。她说：“扔掉衣服挨冻的是我个人；多背米让大伙吃得饱，这是为了胜利。”
    担负护理工作以后，她把伤员当作亲兄弟，爱护伤员无微不至。举个例子说，一九五一年一月上旬，正是朝鲜的严寒时节，她在某地看护伤员。病房很小她怕挤着伤员，不能坐在病房里。因为工作太疲劳，她又不敢到房东的屋子里去，因为走进暖屋子就打瞌睡。于是，她就冒着冷风守坐在病房门口，一连这样坚持了五夜。（附图片）
