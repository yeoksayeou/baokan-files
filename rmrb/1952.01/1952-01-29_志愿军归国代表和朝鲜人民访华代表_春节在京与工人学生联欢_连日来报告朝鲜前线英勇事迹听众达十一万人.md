Xinhua News Agency Report: The delegates from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China have continued to report on their heroic deeds on the Korean front lines at mass meetings of workers, students, and citizens in Beijing in recent days, and have held Spring Festival celebrations with workers and students in Beijing.

On the 24th, 25th, and 26th, the delegates gave reports at approximately 80 mass meetings, reaching an audience of about 110,000 people. The delegates' reports inspired workers, students, and citizens in Beijing to actively launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. They said, "Every word and every character in the delegates' reports touched our hearts. We should earnestly participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, increase production and practice economy, to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army." After listening to the report by the Volunteer Army delegates, the workers of the Beijing Tram Company immediately held an anti-corruption meeting. At the meeting, an old worker, Ma Boqian, said to the corrupt elements, "I pick up coal cinders every day to increase production and practice economy, but no matter how much I pick up, it's not enough for one of you to embezzle. The Volunteer Army on the Korean front lines cherishes the motherland's resources so much, have you heard that? Are you worthy of the Volunteer Army?" After listening to the reports from the Volunteer Army and Korean People's delegates, the representatives of a shoe factory in Beijing immediately relayed the information and organized discussions. The workers said, "We should no longer waste a single scrap of cloth, and we must make the shoes strong and durable to send to the Volunteer Army."

On the 28th, Beijing workers and students held a Spring Festival celebration with the delegates from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China in Zhongshan Park.

First, workers, students, and delegates celebrated in separate groups. The workers and students were ecstatic to see the most beloved people, and everyone sang "The East is Red" and "Song of General Kim Il-sung" together with the delegates, and danced with them. The delegates from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation enthusiastically sang "March of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army," and the delegates from the Korean People's Delegation to China sang many Korean songs and performed many folk dances. Some workers and students warmly held hands with the delegates, leading them to tour the park.

The most touching part was the close conversation between the workers, students, and delegates. The workers and students all wrote down the heroic deeds reported by the delegates. They especially respected the combat heroes among the delegates, and many people asked the heroes for their autographs or wrote the heroes' names in their diaries.

Finally, the workers, students, and delegates held a collective celebration in the square. The workers and students performed many wonderful programs to celebrate the festival with the delegates.
