    Joint Investigation of U.S. Plane Bombing of Kaesong Reveals Facts Proving U.S. Conspiracy to Sabotage Negotiations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th] This agency's reporter reports: The U.S. plane bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone on the 17th demonstrates that when the U.S. side failed to achieve its unreasonable demands at the Korean armistice talks, it once again resorted to the vile trick of sabotaging the negotiations. The testimonies and material evidence obtained by the joint investigation conducted by the liaison officers of both sides after the bombing incident fully prove that the U.S. side should bear full responsibility for this crime of bombing the Kaesong neutral zone in violation of the agreement.
    The investigators from both sides jointly interviewed six adult residents in Lisae-ri, Sajik-dong in the Kaesong neutral zone that had been bombed. They said: They were at home and heard the sound of airplanes circling overhead. After a while, they suddenly heard a piercing "whoosh" sound, followed by the explosion of bombs, with mud and dust flying everywhere and thick smoke rising. Middle-aged farmer Choi Soon-in described the situation when the plane bombed, saying: She was preparing to eat breakfast when the bomb exploded. Her four-year-old child saw the plane circling overhead and ran into the house to say to her, "Mommy, I'm scared, will we be bombed to death?" After the child finished speaking, he fell to the ground. She heard the explosion and immediately pounced on the child, saying to him, "If we are going to die, we will die together." After a while, she stood up and looked outside, and still saw thick smoke rising into the sky.
    The investigators from both sides jointly surveyed a crater about seven meters in diameter and more than one meter deep, and picked up many fragments within a radius of about 100 meters around the crater.
    The investigation was completed at 17:30, and the liaison officers of both sides returned to Panmunjom for a meeting. Since the testimonies and material evidence were all present, the liaison officer from the other side had to admit the facts he had seen. However, he still pretended to need to go back for "investigation." Colonel Zhang Chunshan, our liaison officer, pointed out to Mr. Murray, the other liaison officer, that according to the investigation, the U.S. side should bear full responsibility for this incident. Colonel Zhang Chunshan also lodged a verbal protest with the other liaison officer, demanding that the other side guarantee that similar incidents would not occur again.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th] This agency's reporter reports: Today, our side accepted the other side's request and once again went to the site of the Kaesong neutral zone bombed by U.S. planes on the 17th for a joint investigation. The other liaison officer, Lee Wai, along with three air force officers, also saw with their own eyes, like Murray and others yesterday, the crater about one person deep caused by the U.S. plane bombing and the fragments scattered around the crater. Local resident Zhu Changhua, like the six residents interviewed on the 17th, described in detail to Lee Wai the circumstances before and after the U.S. plane dropped the bomb. Zhu Changhua said: While eating breakfast, he heard a different airplane flying low in the house. Later, he couldn't hear the low-flying sound, and then gradually heard the airplane flying high. After a while, there was a deafening explosion. After the bombing, the airplane sound could not be heard. He went out and saw a lot of mud and fragments. After Lee Wai checked the crater, he admitted that it was caused by an airplane bombing. Although the evidence was conclusive and difficult to deny, Lee Wai still said that he had to find witnesses. Colonel Zhang Chunshan, our liaison officer, said to Lee Wai, "We have given you all the convenience and obtained sufficient testimonies and material evidence. Since your side still wants to find witnesses, we will notify you at 10:00 tomorrow morning after we find them."

    双方调查美机轰炸开城罪行事实证明美方阴谋破坏谈判
    【新华社开城十八日电】本社记者报道：十七日美机轰炸开城中立区，说明了美方在朝鲜停战会议上未能达到它们的无理要求时，又在玩弄破坏谈判的罪恶伎俩。双方联络官在轰炸事件发生后进行共同调查所得的人证、物证，充分证明美方应对此次破坏协议轰炸开城中立区的罪行负完全责任。
    双方调查人员在被轰炸的开城中立区内的丽陵里社稷洞共同访问了六个成年居民。他们说：他们在家里，都听到飞机在上空盘旋的响声，一会儿，忽然听到一种刺耳的“嘘”声，接着，炸弹就爆炸了，泥土纷飞，浓烟直冒。中年农妇崔顺仁叙述飞机轰炸时的情形说：炸弹爆炸前，她正预备吃早饭。她的那个四岁的孩子看到飞机在头上打转，连忙跑进屋子里去对她说：“妈妈，我怕，是不是会被炸死？”孩子说完话以后，就伏倒在地上。她听到爆炸声，马上扑在孩子身上，并且对孩子说：“要死我们就死在一起。”一会儿，她站起来朝外看，还看到浓烟冲向天空。
    双方调查人员共同勘查了直径约七公尺、有一人多深的弹坑，并在弹坑周围约一百公尺地带内，拾得不少弹片。
    十七时三十分调查完毕，双方联络官返板门店举行会议。由于人证、物证俱在，对方联络官不得不承认已看到的事实。但仍佯言还需要回去“调查”。我方联络官张春山上校向对方联络官穆莱指出：根据调查所得，美方对此次事件应负全部责任。张春山上校并向对方联络官提出口头抗议，要求对方保证以后不再发生类似事件。
    【新华社开城十八日电】本社记者报道：十八日我方接受对方要求，再次前往十七日为美机轰炸的开城中立区的实地进行共同调查。对方联络官李维率同三个空军军官也和昨天穆莱等人一样，亲眼看到了美机轰炸的约一个人深的弹坑和四散在弹坑周围的弹片。当地居民朱长华也和十七日六个被访问的居民一样，详尽地向李维叙述了美机投弹的前后经过情形。朱长华说：在吃早饭的时候，他在屋内听到比平常不同的飞机低飞声音，后来低飞声音听不到了，又渐渐听到飞机高飞的声音，一会儿，就是震耳的爆炸声，炸后飞机声就听不见了。他出去就看到了许多泥块和弹片。李维查了弹坑后，承认是飞机炸的。虽然证据确凿绝难狡赖，但是李维仍说还要找证人。我方联络官张春山上校对李维说：“我们已予你们以一切便利，得到了充分的人证物证。既然你方还要再找人证，我们找到后于明晨十时通知你方。”
