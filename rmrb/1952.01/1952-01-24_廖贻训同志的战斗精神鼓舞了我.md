    Comrade Liao Yixun's Fighting Spirit Inspired Me

    Editor: I was originally a railway worker. While building the Beijing-Hankou Railway, my right femur was fractured, and my right hand was also split open. I was quite content when I first started recuperating. Later, I discovered that the femur had shifted, leaving me disabled, and I lost interest in life, becoming pessimistic and despondent. At the time, some people comforted me, saying, "You were disabled while building the people's railway, and the country will take good care of you." However, the more the country cared for me, the more ashamed I felt, and the more anxious I became. Later, Lin Ying, the director of the Baoding Railway Hospital, gave me a Soviet novel, "How the Steel Was Tempered." The spirit of Paul Kochagin in overcoming difficulties and persisting in his work gave my thinking a new direction. The deeds of the legless warrior Luo Yunzhang, who persisted in his work, published in the "Party Life" column of the People's Daily on September 27th last year, also gave me a clear direction. But what impressed me the most was the article "The Beginning of a New Battle," published on page four of the People's Daily on January 6th. This article completely shattered my ideological concerns and strengthened my fighting will.

    I still have two fingers on my right hand – the thumb and index finger – which is better than Comrade Liao Yixun's condition. Therefore, I have more confidence to practice my skills and prepare to meet new work tasks.

    廖贻训同志的战斗精神鼓舞了我
    编辑同志：我原来是一个铁路工人，在修筑京汉铁路时，右腿的股骨折断了，右手也被劈裂了。我在开始休养的时候还很安心。后来发现股骨变了位置，成了残废，便对生活失去了兴趣，产生悲观失望的情绪。当时曾有人安慰我：“你为修筑人民的铁路而残废，国家一定会很好地照顾你。”但是，国家越照顾我，我越感觉惭愧，也就越着急。后来保定铁路医院院长林英同志送给我一本苏联小说——“钢铁是怎样炼成的”，书中保尔·柯察金克服困难、坚持工作的精神，使我的思想开始有了转变。去年九月二十七日人民日报“党的生活”栏内刊载的无腿战士罗云章同志坚持工作的事迹，也给了我一个明确的指针。但令我感受最深的，要算一月六日人民日报第四版刊载的“重新战斗的开始”一文，这篇文章完全打破了我的思想顾虑，增强了我的战斗的意志。
    我的右手还有两个指头——拇指和食指，比廖贻训同志的条件还要好一些。因此，我更有信心练好本领，准备迎接新的工作任务。
