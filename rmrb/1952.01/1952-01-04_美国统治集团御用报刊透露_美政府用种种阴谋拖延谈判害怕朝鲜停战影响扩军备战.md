Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 2nd: The Truman government fears that a Korean armistice would relax international tensions and make it difficult to pass its plans for further expansion of armaments and war preparations in the upcoming Congressional session in January due to public opposition. Therefore, it is using various means to delay the Korean armistice negotiations. The U.S. ruling clique's own mouthpieces have openly confirmed this calculation by the Truman government.

The December 24th issue of "Newsweek" wrote: "The government is now quite worried about what impact a Korean armistice will have on the rearmament plan. With the possibility of a ceasefire being at least fifty-fifty in the coming weeks, the mobilization effort may fail due to public apathy." "Newsweek" continued: "Regardless of what happens in Korea, Truman will emphasize the necessity of preparedness in his State of the Union address and budget message. He will make these demands: 1. Allocate more funds for U.S. defense (especially the Air Force); 2. Increase taxes; 3. Do not abandon the foreign aid plan (note: this is the U.S. plan to force its vassal states to step up their preparations for war); 4. Restore all economic controls. Under the current circumstances, achieving these goals may be very difficult, and even more difficult if the shooting stops. They simply can't think of any good way to prevent people from relaxing after the end of the Korean War." The financial editor of the "New York Post" wrote even more bluntly in an article on December 14th: "We are now involved in an accelerating military expansion movement... The speed of this movement will be unprecedentedly relaxed by an untimely Korean armistice."

Thus, the U.S. ruling clique has completely exposed its true face in obstructing the immediate agreement on the Korean armistice negotiations. However, no matter what conspiracies and tricks they employ, they cannot ease the growing dissatisfaction of the American people with the U.S. government's delay of the negotiations. A New York dispatch published in the Paris "L'Humanité" on December 26th showed that people from all walks of life in the United States are feeling increasingly anxious about the delayed progress of the Korean armistice. National peace defenders have organized to carry out demonstrations during Christmas demanding an end to the Korean War. In Seattle, thousands of telegrams have been sent to Truman in recent days, calling for a Korean armistice. In Chicago, peace activists and trade union workers have sent delegations to meet with congressmen and senators who are spending Christmas at home, demanding a swift ceasefire.

### 美国统治集团御用报刊透露  美政府用种种阴谋拖延谈判害怕朝鲜停战影响扩军备战

    美国统治集团御用报刊透露
    美政府用种种阴谋拖延谈判害怕朝鲜停战影响扩军备战
    【新华社布拉格二日电】杜鲁门政府害怕朝鲜停战会使国际紧张状态松弛下来，使进一步扩大备战的计划因遭遇人民的反对而在一月复会后的国会中难于通过，因此，正使用种种手段来拖延朝鲜停战谈判。美国统治集团御用的报刊已公开证实了杜鲁门政府的这种盘算。
    十二月二十四日出版的“新闻周刊”写道：“政府现在颇为忧虑，不知道朝鲜停战会对重整军备计划产生什么影响。在停火的可能性在今后几个星期内至少是一半一半的时候，动员工作可能由于公众不热心而告失败。”“新闻周刊”接着说：“不论朝鲜发生什么情况，杜鲁门总会在他的国情咨文和预算咨文里强调准备的必要。他会提出这些要求：一、为美国的防务（特别是空军）拨出更多的款项；二、增加赋税；三、不放弃对外援助计划（按：即美国压迫它的附庸国家加紧备战的计划）；四、恢复一切经济管制。在目前的情况下想达到这些目的，可能是很困难的，如果射击停止以后，甚至还要更加困难。他们简直想不出任何好办法，不让人们在朝鲜战争结束后松劲。”十二月十四日“纽约邮报”的财政编辑在一篇文章里更率直地写道：“我们现在正卷入一个加速进行的扩张军备运动中……这个运动的速度将因不适时的朝鲜停战而空前地松弛下来。”
    这样，美国统治集团就完全暴露了他们阻挠朝鲜停战谈判立即获得协议的真面目。但是，不管他们施展什么样的阴谋诡计，他们都无法缓和美国人民对美国政府拖延谈判的日益增长的不满。巴黎“人道报”十二月二十六日刊载的纽约电讯表明，美国各阶层人民对于朝鲜停战的迟迟未获进展，感到越来越大的焦虑。全国和平保卫者纷纷组织起来，在圣诞节进行要求停止朝鲜战争的示威运动。在西雅图，最近几天里，就有成千件电报拍发给杜鲁门，呼吁在朝鲜停战。在芝加哥，和平战士和工会工作者都派遣代表团去会见在家里过圣诞节的众议员和参议员，要求迅速实现停战。
