Scientific Journals Should Not Be Published in English

To the Editor: I have seen that among the nineteen journals published recently by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and edited by various academic societies, except for eight journals such as the "Acta Meteorologica Sinica" which are published in Chinese, the "Bulletin of the Geological Society of China," "Acta Geophysica Sinica," "Acta Mathematica Sinica," "Chemical Industry and Engineering," "Palaeontologia Sinica," "Chinese Journal of Hydrobiology," "Acta Physica Sinica," and "Chinese Journal of Experimental Biology" are all published in English, with only very simple Chinese abstracts attached; "Chinese Journal of Zoology" and "Acta Phytotaxonomica Sinica" are also bilingual in Chinese and English. I think this is very inappropriate. Does this mean that Chinese cannot be used to record the achievements of scientific research? If it is for exchange with foreign countries, then the Academy of Sciences already has a special "Science Record Quarterly" for foreign communication, which should be enough. I hope the relevant departments will change this practice.

    科学杂志不该用英文印行
    编辑同志：我看到最近中国科学院印行、各学会主编的十九种杂志，其中除“气象学报”等八种用中文印行外，“中国地质学会志”、“中国地球物理学报”、“中国数学学报”、“化学工业与工程”、“中国古生物学会刊”、“中国水生生物学汇报”、“中国物理学报”和“中国实验生物学杂志”，全部用英文印行，只是附以极简单的中文提纲；“中国动物学杂志”和“植物分类学报”也是中英文并用。我认为这样很不合适。难道说中文就不能用以记录科学研究的成果吗？如果说是为了和国外交换，那末，科学院已有了专门对外的“科学记录季刊”，也就够了。我希望有关部门改变这种做法。
