Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The Premier of the Central People's Government, Zhou Enlai, convened a reporting conference on the afternoon of the 9th for senior cadres from the Party organs, government organs, military organs, and mass organizations at the central level, North China level, and the two cities of Beijing and Tianjin, as well as figures from industry and commerce, literary and art workers, scientific workers, journalists, and others, totaling more than 2,300 people, regarding the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy; at the same time, he instructed all staff in Beijing to listen to the broadcast on the radio.

The conference began at 3:00 PM. Premier Zhou Enlai announced at the opening of the meeting: "Since December of last year, the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, as called for by Chairman Mao, has now been launched nationwide. This is a serious and intense revolutionary struggle, requiring all our national Party, government, military, and civilian staff to participate in this struggle with an extremely serious, earnest, and responsible attitude, without exception. We also call on people from all sectors of society nationwide, especially those in industry and commerce, to actively participate in this movement and undergo self-transformation.

"Currently, the development of this movement is still in its initial stage and is not very balanced. Taking the central level as an example, it still needs to be further mobilized to combine leadership with the masses in order to achieve the universality and depth of the movement.

"The people of the whole country and all state staff should respond to Chairman Mao's call, and from their own social life and work posts, rapidly, thoroughly, and unreservedly launch a mass-based examination, reporting, and confession movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to resist the erosion of the bourgeoisie and to cleanse the filth and poison left over from the old society."

Director of the Central People's Government's Austerity Inspection Committee, Bo Yibo, then gave a report entitled "Striving to Deepen and Universally Carry Out the Movement Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy."

After Director Bo Yibo's report, Premier Zhou Enlai instructed all organs and organizations to seriously discuss Director Bo Yibo's report and continue to launch examination, reporting, and confession movements in order to more universally and deeply carry out the serious political struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    周总理指示继续发动群众展开反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的严重政治斗争
    【新华社九日讯】中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理于九日下午，召集中央一级、华北一级和京津两市的党的机关、政府机关、军事机关、群众团体的高级干部，以及工商界人士，文艺工作者，科学工作者，新闻工作者等共二千三百余人，举行关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的报告大会；同时责成北京所有工作人员在收音机前收听播音。
    大会于下午三时开始。周恩来总理宣布开会时说：“从去年十二月起，毛主席所号召的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动，现在已经在全国范围内开展起来了。这是一个严重的紧张的革命斗争，需要我们全国党、政、军、民的全体工作人员以极严肃的、认真的和负责的态度，无例外地一致来参加这一斗争。我们并号召全国社会人士，特别是工商界人士积极参加这一运动，进行自我改造。
    “现在，这一运动的发展，还在开始阶段，还不很平衡。就拿中央一级来说，也还需要继续发动，使领导与群众结合，以求运动的普遍和深入。
    “全国人民和全体的国家工作人员，应该响应毛主席的号召，从自己的社会生活和工作岗位上，迅速地、彻底地、无保留地开展一个反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的群众性的检讨、检举和坦白运动，来反对资产阶级的侵蚀，来洗净旧社会遗留下来的污毒。”
    中央人民政府节约检查委员会薄一波主任接着作了“为深入地普遍地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动而斗争”的报告。
    在薄一波主任报告后，周恩来总理指示各机关团体要对薄一波主任的报告进行认真的讨论，继续发动检讨、检举和坦白的运动，以更普遍地、更深入地开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的严重政治斗争。
