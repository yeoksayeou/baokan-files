    Grain Company of Huangchuan Special District, Henan Province, Disregarded Grain Transfer Work, Causing Two Shipwrecks
    Editor: Certain responsible cadres of the Grain Company of Huangchuan Special District, Henan Province, have serious bureaucratic tendencies. This company has had two shipwrecks while transferring grain from the Huai River. The reason for this is that they did not pay enough attention to the grain transfer work, and did not treat it as a political task to be completed. They neither investigated nor studied the transportation conditions of Huangchuan Special District, nor did they assign a specific person to be responsible. When loading the bags, they did not distinguish between good and bad quality, and loaded wheat containing sand and sprouted wheat together with the good wheat. During transportation, they insisted on having the ships travel together, so that they could not unload the goods on schedule after arriving at the destination, which caused dissatisfaction among the boatmen. Because there was no one in charge, the ships were not thoroughly inspected before transportation, resulting in a shipwreck accident on November 4th of last year. However, the leading cadres of this company did not learn from this lesson, and when transferring wheat on November 22nd, one of the ships sank due to excessive load, encountering wind and rain when it reached Zhengyangguan in northern Anhui. They also did not rescue these ships in a timely manner, delaying the salvage for nine days. By the time they were salvaged, most of the wheat had deteriorated, and two-thirds of the sacks had been torn, resulting in a loss of more than 140 million yuan. In addition to the salvage and transportation costs, the total loss of state assets was more than 21 million yuan.
    I believe that the Grain Company of Huangchuan Special District should investigate the responsibility for the accident, learn from the above lessons, and avoid similar incidents from happening again.

### 河南潢川专区粮食公司  不重视调运粮食工作造成了两次沉船事件

    河南潢川专区粮食公司
    不重视调运粮食工作造成了两次沉船事件
    编辑同志：河南潢川专区粮食公司某些负责干部，有严重的官僚主义作风。这个公司从淮河调运粮食时，曾发生两次沉船事件。其原因，是他们对调运粮食工作重视不够，没有把它当作政治任务去完成。他们对潢川专区的交通情况既不调查研究，也没有指定专人负责。在装包时，不分质量好坏，把带有沙土和发了芽的小麦，也和好的装在一起。在运送时，又硬要船只集中一齐走，以致到达目的地后，不能按期卸货，引起船主不满。由于没有专人负责，在运输前，没有很好地检查船只，因而在去年十一月四日曾发生过沉船事故。但这个公司的领导干部，并没有记取这一教训，到十一月二十二日调运小麦时，其中有一只船因载量过重，驶到皖北正阳关，遭遇风雨，又沉没了。他们对这些船只也没有及时抢救，一直拖延了九天才去打捞。等捞上来时，小麦多半已变质，麻袋也崩裂了三分之二，计损失一千四百多万元，再加上打捞费、装运费共损失国家资财二千一百多万元。
    我认为：潢川专区粮食公司应追究失事责任，并接受上述教训，避免再发生类似事件。
