    Cadres of the Gao Lake Village Farmers Association in Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province,
    Embezzle and Waste the Fruits of Victory, Should be Punished
    To the Editor: The Farmers Association of Gao Lake Village, Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, confiscated grain, cloth, clothing and other materials from landlords during the land reform, worth approximately 10,000 catties of rice. It has only been nine months since the land reform, and the Farmers Association already has a significant deficit, and currently cannot even afford to buy candles for evening meetings. According to my understanding, the director of the Farmers Association, Ji Yanmei, was a member of the Kuomintang in the past, and the deputy director, Ji Handong, was a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League in the past. All the confiscated cloth, clothing, and farm implements have been embezzled by Ji Yanmei; more than 20 dan of confiscated tea seeds (which can be used to extract oil) have either rotted, or were simply never picked from the mountains, a complete waste. In this way, the fruits of victory, worth 10,000 catties of rice, have been muddledly squandered. Although Ji Yanmei has now been replaced by the farmers, the matter has not been investigated. I believe that the relevant leading departments should quickly handle this matter.

    浙江青田县高湖村农民协会干部
    贪污浪费胜利果实应受处分
    编辑同志：浙江省青田县高湖村的农民协会，在土地改革中没收了地主的粮食、布匹、衣料等物资，约值一万斤大米。土地改革到现在不过九个月，农民协会就有了不少的亏空，目前连晚上开会买腊烛的钱也付不出来。据我了解，农民协会主任季岩妹过去是国民党员，副主任季汉东过去是三青团员。所有没收的布匹、衣裳、农具，已被季岩妹贪污了；没收的茶子（可以榨油）有二十多担，有的已经烂掉，有的就根本没有从山上摘回来，完全浪费了。这样，价值一万斤大米的胜利果实就糊里糊涂地化为乌有了。现在季岩妹虽已被农民撤换，但没有查办。我觉得，有关领导部门应该迅速处理这件事。
