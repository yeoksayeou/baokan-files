    (Seven) He used this fake receipt to defraud the cooperative of 215,000 yuan. This was the first embezzlement.
    (Eight) Because the leadership didn't discover this for a long time, he continued to do such things three or four more times. According to him, he issued receipts for a total of 510 jin of cotton in four instances, and received more than one million yuan from the cooperative. He put all this money in the pockets of his cotton-padded coat.
    (Nine) On the evening of December 17th last year, he took off his cotton-padded coat and put it on the kang in the cooperative. The director of the cooperative, whether mistakenly or deliberately, took his coat. Fearing that his trickery would be discovered, he fled from Wuqing County to Tianjin overnight.
