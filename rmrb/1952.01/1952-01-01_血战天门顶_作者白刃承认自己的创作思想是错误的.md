    "Bloody Battle at Tianmen Peak" Author Bai Ren Admits His Creative Ideology Was Wrong

    Editor: I agree with your principled criticism of the "false surrender" passage in my "Bloody Battle at Tianmen Peak." My article disseminated erroneous ideas and had a bad influence on readers. Your criticism is completely correct and necessary.

    "Bloody Battle at Tianmen Peak" was developed from my short story "The Death of Platoon Leader Zhang" during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The original story was based on several similar battles, but there was no "false surrender" passage at all. Therefore, the "false surrender" passage, as you pointed out, is a completely false story and seriously distorts the heroic qualities of our army and Chairman Mao's brilliant military thinking.

    Your criticism has educated me, making me deeply aware that there are serious petty-bourgeois ideological tendencies in my creative thinking. I am now conducting a comprehensive review of my creative ideology and works in order to correct mistakes and thoroughly transform my thinking. Bai Ren

    Editor's Note: After this newspaper published its criticism of Comrade Bai Ren's novel "Bloody Battle at Tianmen Peak," we continuously received letters from comrades such as Zhou Jing from Xuzhou, Fu Fengying from Zhengzhou, Guo Zhenjiang from the Political Department directly under the Logistics Department of the Hubei Military Region, Chen Yufu from Peking University, Zhang Jiansheng from Cangxian Public Security Bureau, Zu Min, Hou Yingbang from Taiyuan People's Bank, Xia Zhiheng from Tianjin, and Luo Minshi from Hengyang. They said that they had been readers of Bai Ren's work. Some were previously influenced by the erroneous ideas in Bai Ren's work without realizing it; some had suspected certain problematic areas but did not dare to draw conclusions; some had even written criticisms to the People's Literature Publishing House, but those criticisms were not taken seriously.

    These readers pointed out in their letters: The battle described in "Bloody Battle at Tianmen Peak" was caused by the troops camping on Tianmen Peak. However, camping on Tianmen Peak was a violation of the higher authorities' decision at the time. Therefore, this novel lacks educational significance. "False surrender" is even more unimaginable in the people's army. The author absurdly misinterpreted Chairman Mao's great strategic and tactical thinking. Comrade Bai Ren's works have a segment of readers among troops and cadres in government offices. The petty-bourgeois ideas, feelings, and tastes he propagated in his works have had a very bad influence on some readers.

    "Bloody Battle at Tianmen Peak" has been adapted into comic strips and has sold nearly ten thousand copies, which has further aggravated the negative impact of this work on the masses.

    The aforementioned readers unanimously requested Comrade Bai Ren to conduct a self-criticism. We forwarded these letters to Comrade Bai Ren, and he replied that he had realized his mistakes and was preparing to conduct a self-criticism. We believe that as long as the author is good at using the weapon of self-criticism and thoroughly examines his own thinking and artistic views, he will be able to correct his mistakes and improve his work.

### “血战天门顶”作者白刃承认自己的创作思想是错误的

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    “血战天门顶”作者白刃承认自己的创作思想是错误的
    编辑同志：我同意你们对我写的“血战天门顶”中“假投降”一段的原则性的批评。我的文章散布了错误思想，在读者中造成了坏影响。你们的批评是完全正确的，必要的。
    “血战天门顶”是根据我在抗战时期的短篇小说“章排长之死”并加以发展写成的。原来的那篇小说是根据几个类似的战斗写成的，但根本没有“假投降”这一段。因此，“假投降”这一段，正如你们所指出的，是彻头彻尾虚伪的故事，是严重地歪曲了我军的英雄品质和毛主席的英明的军事思想。
    你们的批评教育了我，使我深深感到在自己的创作思想中，存在着严重的小资产阶级的思想倾向。现在我正对自己的创作思想及作品，进行全面的检查，以便纠正错误，彻底改造思想。    白刃
    编者按：本报发表了对白刃同志的小说“血战天门顶”的批评以后，连续接到徐州周竞、郑州傅凤英、湖北军区后勤部直属政治处郭镇江、北京大学陈予福、沧县公安局张建生、太原人民银行足民、侯应邦、天津夏志恒、衡阳罗民师等同志的来信。他们说，他们曾经是白刃这篇作品的读者。有人以前受了白刃的作品中的错误思想的影响而没有察觉；有人曾经怀疑过某些有问题的地方，但是不敢下断语；有人还给人民文学社写过批评，但是那些批评没有被重视。
    这些读者在来信中指出：“血战天门顶”中所描写的一场战斗，是由于部队在天门顶宿营而引起的。但宿营在天门顶，是违反当时上级决定的。因此，这篇小说缺乏教育意义。“假投降”在人民部队中更是不可想像的，作者荒谬绝伦地曲解了毛主席伟大的战略战术思想。白刃同志的作品在部队和机关干部中拥有一部分读者。他在作品中所传播的小资产阶级思想、感情和趣味，已给一些读者以很不好的影响。
    “血战天门顶”曾经被改编成连环图画，发行了近万册，更加重了这个作品在群众中的不良影响。
    上述的几位读者一致要求白刃同志进行检讨。我们把这些信转给白刃同志，他复信表示已经认识了自己的错误，准备检讨。我们相信只要作者善于运用自我批评的武器，彻底检查自己的思想和艺术观，作者是能够纠正错误，改进工作的。
