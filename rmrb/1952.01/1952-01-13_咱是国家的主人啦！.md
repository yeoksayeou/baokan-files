    "We are masters of the country!"
    Wang Jizhou
    In late November of last year, I was returning home from Xi'an. When I reached my village (Beiwangyan Village, Seventh District, Lintong County, Shaanxi Province), it was already dark. The whole family was sitting on the warm kang, talking animatedly about something. As soon as I walked in, my mother saw me and called out affectionately, "Oh! Jizhou is back!" My father, Wang Laojiu, said, "You're back just in time, we're revising our patriotic pact, come and join us..."
    "Look at 'Da' (Father)'s impatience!" My sister interrupted him, "Jizhou has traveled over a hundred li, you don't ask if he's thirsty or hungry, you just ask about those things."
    Seeing my father's high spirits, I quickly said, "I'm not hungry, let's make the pact first!" My father glared at my sister and said to me, "You probably already know in Xi'an, it's in the newspapers: Chairman Mao issued a call to increase production and practice economy. How should our family respond? What should each person increase in production and save on? If we revise it into a pact, we can follow it."
    I said, "Very good, let Mom speak first."
    My mother smiled broadly, she first gave a few examples of how the family patriotic pact promoted production and how it harmonized the family, and then said, "Besides taking care of the children, I will spin six liang of thread every day (I used to spin only five liang). Now the nights are long, it won't hurt to sleep a little later!" My sister-in-law said, "I want to weave more cloth, and also feed the cattle." My wife, Meirong, looked at me shyly and said, "I listen to Chairman Mao's words and won't waste a single grain of rice or flour; I will learn five characters every day in winter school. I will also do more odd jobs, like carrying water, pulling soil, ... let 'Da' write more kuaiban and do more publicity... What do you think?"
    Finally, it was my father's turn. He threw his dry tobacco pipe on the kang and said loudly, "Good! You all spoke well. – As for me, I'll first store a few bundles of cotton in the cooperative. Also, I will lay a good foundation for increasing production next year, accumulate more manure, and plow the winter fields deeply and level them. I plan to organize a mutual aid group next spring; produce more grain, grow more cotton, and supply it to the factories..." My father loved to sing kuaiban. At this point, he enthusiastically opened his voice and sang a kuaiban: I, Lao Wang, have turned over, wholeheartedly love the country and defend the Jiangshan. Strive to increase production and not just talk empty words, move all ten fingers diligently. My heart is stronger than iron, my body is better than youth, my pen is a gun, although the words are not good, they are like bullets, compile kuaiban for everyone to spread, raise awareness and move forward together, I will donate the manuscript fee, buy airplanes and cannons to send to Korea. Don't think I'm old and can't do anything, I still want to catch bad guys all the time.
    This made everyone laugh. He continued, "Don't slap yourself in the face, we must do what we say. Now we are the masters of the country! We must act like masters in everything. Jizhou, write it down quickly."
    I wrote for a while. Finally, I asked my sister, "What will you do?" She said, "I'll go back and have my family make one too!" The nephew next to me naively interjected, "Making a pact is good, 'Always follow Chairman Mao, replace old cows with big machines'...." Another burst of laughter.
    The next morning, I was awakened by the sound of the spinning wheel. My mother was already spinning thread. My father had also gone to the district government early to preside over the "Kuaiban Conference." I was very moved, I felt that the peasants are so patriotic, I am a revolutionary cadre, what should I do? I must work harder to do my job well. (Originally published in Shaanxi Daily)

    “咱是国家的主人啦！”
    王继洲
    去年十一月下旬，我从西安市回家，走到我村（陕西省临潼县七区北王墕村）时，天已黑了。全家人坐在热炕上，正七嘴八舌地不知谈些什么。我刚走进门，就被母亲看见了，她亲地叫道：“哟！继洲回来啦！”我父亲王老九说：“回来的正巧，我们正在修订爱国公约咧，快来参加……”
    “看我‘大’（父亲）那急性子！”我姐打断他的话头说：“继洲走了一百多里路，你不问渴咧，还是饿咧，就先问那些话。”
    我见父亲劲头满高，忙说：“我不饿，咱先来订公约吧！”父亲把姐姐瞪了一眼，又对我说：“你在西安也许早知道了，就是报上登的：毛主席发出了增产节约的号召，咱家该怎样响应，每个人该增产、节约些啥？修订在公约里，就能照着干啦。”
    我说：“好得很，让妈先说说。”
    母亲笑的抿不住嘴，她先举了几个例子，说明家庭爱国公约怎样推动生产、怎样使家庭和睦，接着说道：“我除哄娃娃外，每天要纺六两线（过去只纺五两）。现在夜长，迟睡会也没啥！”我嫂子说：“我要多织布，捎带着喂牛。”我的老婆美容，用眼看了看我，不好意思地说：“我听毛主席的话，不浪费一把米面；每天上冬学要认会五个字。还要多做些零碎活，比如担水呀，拉土呀，……让我‘大’多编快板多宣传……你们看行不行？”
    最后轮到我父亲了，他把旱烟袋往炕上一撩，大声说：“好！你们都说的好。——我哩，我先把几捆棉花存给合作社。再就是打好明年增产的底子，多攒粪土，冬耕地要犁深耱平。计划明年春上，组织个互助组；多打粮食，多种棉花，供给工厂用……”我父亲喜爱唱快板，说到这里，他兴致勃勃地放开嗓子，唱起快板来：我老王，把身翻，热心爱国保江山。努力增产不空谈，十个指头勤动弹。我的心，比铁坚，我的身子赛青年，我的毛笔是枪杆，字虽不好，像子弹，编成快板人人传，提高觉悟齐向前，得下稿费我捐献，买上飞机、大炮送朝鲜。别看老了不能干，我时时还想抓坏蛋。
    惹的大伙齐笑了，他接着又说：“自己别打自己的嘴巴子，说到就要做到。现在咱是国家主人啦！一切事情都要拿出当家作主的样子来。继洲，你快记下。”
    我写了一阵。最后问姐姐：“你怎么办呢？”她说：“我回去叫我屋里也订！”旁边的外甥天真地插嘴说：“订公约就是好，‘永远跟着毛主席，老牛要换大机器’……。”又是一场大笑。
    第二天清早，我被纺车声音惊醒，母亲已在纺线啦。父亲也早到区政府主持“快板大会”去了。我非常感动，觉得农民都这样的爱国，我是一个革命的干部，我又该怎样呢？我要更努力地做好自己的工作。（原载陕西日报）
