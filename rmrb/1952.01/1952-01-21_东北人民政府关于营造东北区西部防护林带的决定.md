    Decision of the Northeast People's Government on Creating a Western Protective Forest Belt in the Northeast Region

    In order to transform the natural conditions in the western region of Northeast China, overcome disasters caused by wind, sand, water, and drought, expand the area of benefited farmland, increase crop yields, augment timber resources, and improve people's lives, this government has decided to create a western protective forest belt in Northeast China.

    I. Scope of Construction for the Western Protective Forest Belt in Northeast China: Stretching from the Liaodong Peninsula and Shanhaiguan (including coastal defense forests) in the south to Fuyu and Gannan south of the Greater Khingan Range in the north, it will be approximately 1,100 kilometers long and up to 300 kilometers wide at its widest point. The afforestation area will be approximately 3.0 million hectares (including 529 and 640 hectares in Inner Mongolia). A total of sixty counties and banners (seven banners in Inner Mongolia) are included. The benefited area will reach approximately 200,000 square kilometers.

    II. To ensure the timely completion of the protective forest belt construction plan, governments at all levels within the western protective forest belt construction area must prioritize this work as one of their important tasks. Strengthen organizational leadership, augment cadres, improve forestry agencies, and make concrete preparations. Resolve the land needed for nurseries and designate seed stands to supply tree seeds. At the same time, conduct thorough discussions and arrangements through people's representative conferences, labor mutual aid groups, etc., and strengthen inspections. Educate the broad masses about the great significance of creating a protective forest belt, mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, and organize all possible manpower and resources to participate in this huge construction project.

    III. Forestry agencies at all levels should greatly increase the number of nurseries, store seeds, actively train afforestation cadres, strengthen technical guidance, improve survival rates, reduce costs, and implement an economic accounting system. Improve the political and professional levels of forestry administrative cadres and technical personnel, make good preparations, actively carry out construction, and conduct timely inspections, striving to basically complete the construction plan within ten years.

    IV. Conduct widespread publicity and education on the construction of the protective forest belt through newspapers, radio, rural winter schools, night schools, etc.

    It is hoped that the above items will be conscientiously followed and guaranteed by governments at all levels and relevant departments.

    东北人民政府关于营造东北区西部防护林带的决定
    为改造东北区西部地区的自然条件，战胜风、沙、水、旱灾害，以扩大农田受益面积，提高农作物产量，增加木材来源，提高人民生活，本府特决定营造东北西部防护林带。
    一、东北西部防护林带营造范围：南起辽东半岛和山海关（包括海防林）；北至兴安岭以南的富裕、甘南等地，长约一千一百公里，最宽处达三百余公里，造林面积约三百余万垧（其中包括内蒙五二九、六四○垧）。总括六十县旗（内蒙七旗）。受益面积约达二十余万平方公里。
    二、为保证防护林带营造计划得以按期完成，西部防护林带营造区域内各级人民政府必须把这一工作列为重要任务之一。加强组织领导，充实干部，健全林业机构，作好具体准备工作。解决苗圃所需土地，划定母树林，以供应林木种籽。同时，通过人民代表会议、劳动互助组等，认真讨论布置，加强检查。教育广大群众，认识营造防护林带的重大意义，发动群众的积极性，组织一切可能的人力物力，参加这一巨大的建设工作。
    三、各级林业机关，应大量增设苗圃，储备种子，积极训练造林干部，加强技术指导，提高成活率，降低成本，贯彻经济核算制。提高林业行政干部及技术人员的政治、业务水平，作好准备工作，积极进行营造，并适时检查，争取十年内基本完成营造计划。
    四、通过报纸、广播、农村冬学、夜校等，广泛进行营造防护林带的宣传教育。
    以上各项希各级人民政府及有关部门切实遵照保证执行。
