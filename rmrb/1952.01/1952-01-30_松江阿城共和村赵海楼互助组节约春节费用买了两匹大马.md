Letter Summary:

    Zhao Hailou Mutual Aid Team of Gonghe Village, Acheng, Songjiang, Saved Spring Festival Expenses to Buy Two Horses
    Under the leadership of Zhao Hailou, a model cadre and secretary of the Communist Party branch, the villagers of Gonghe Village, Acheng County, Songjiang Province, have been saving Spring Festival expenses and investing in production. In response to Chairman Mao’s call for “increasing production and practicing economy” and Chairman Gao Gang of Northeast China’s call for “increasing grain production by five liters per mu,” Zhao Hailou convened a meeting of the entire team in early January to discuss ways to save money. Everyone unanimously agreed that savings should begin with this year’s Spring Festival. It was decided that this year, they would not buy incense, candles, or spirit paper, would not set off firecrackers, and would not be extravagant. As a result, the fifteen households in the team saved more than four million yuan in holiday expenses. They have now used this money to buy two horses. Currently, the masses in the entire village are learning from them and are enthusiastically discussing ways to expand production.　Gu Futian

    松江阿城共和村赵海楼互助组节约春节费用买了两匹大马
    松江省阿城县共和村在模范干部中共支部书记赵海楼和他领导的互助组的带动下，纷纷节约春节用款，投入生产。赵海楼为了响应毛主席“增产节约”和东北高岗主席“每亩地多打五升粮食”的号召，在今年一月初，召集全组开会，讨论节约办法。大家一致认为应先从今年的春节节约做起。大家决定：今年春节不买香烛神纸，不用炮竹，不铺张浪费。这样一来，全组十五户就节省了过节钱四百多万元。现在已拿这笔钱买了二匹大马。眼下全村群众都纷纷学习，正在热哄哄地讨论扩大生产的办法。　谷福田
