Regarding the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on January 1, 1951, a full year has passed today. Local organizations of the Communist Party of China have established and strengthened mass propaganda work according to this decision. By December 1951, according to incomplete statistics, there were more than 1.92 million propagandists nationwide. Among them, the North China region has more than 600,600 people; the Northeast region has more than 300,000 people; the East China region has more than 650,000 people; the Central South region has more than 236,000 people; the Southwest region has more than 85,000 people; and the Northwest region has more than 30,000 people. In terms of provinces, the number of propagandists is the largest in Hebei and Shandong provinces, each with more than 330,000 people. The percentage of propagandists to the total population of the region is the largest in Hebei and Chahar provinces, both exceeding 1% of the total population of the province; Shanxi and Shandong provinces are also close to 1%. Most of the leading organs of the Party committees above the district level throughout the country have established reporters. At present, there are more than 50,000 Party reporters nationwide. Party reporters and propagandists have also united a large number of mass propaganda activists around them to form a huge mass propaganda team. In some places, the propaganda force that the Party organization can often mobilize has reached more than 15% of the total population. The great activities carried out by Party reporters and propagandists have played a significant role in promoting various central tasks.

The vast majority of the Party's more than 50,000 reporters can report to the people on time. In the Northeast region alone, more than 30 million people have listened to the reports of the reporters. According to incomplete statistics, Party reporters at all levels in East China have also reported to more than 19.79 million people. Most of the more than 1.92 million propagandists established by the Party's grassroots organizations can also play a role, with only a small portion not playing a role. Among the propagandists in various provinces and cities, those who regularly play a role are more numerous in Hebei Province and Shanghai. In Hebei Province, propagandists who regularly play a role account for 67% of the total number of propagandists in the province, those who play a role but not regularly account for 27%, and those who do not play a role account for only 6%. In Shanghai, propagandists who regularly play a role account for 52% of the total number of propagandists in the city, those who play a role but not regularly account for 42%, and those who do not play a role account for only 6%.

The great activities carried out by Party reporters and propagandists have played a significant role in promoting the development of central tasks such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, land reform, strengthening national defense, and increasing production and practicing economy. The people call reporters and propagandists "inquiry offices," "ideological doctors," and "speakers for Chairman Mao." In many places, the original work could not be promoted. Due to the establishment of a propaganda network, large-scale propaganda work was carried out based on the people's ideological situation, which improved the people's political awareness and revolutionary enthusiasm, and helped to bring about a change in the work in these places, making the relationship between the Party and the people's government and the people closer. Due to the establishment of a propaganda network and the frequent use of propaganda methods to promote work, the leadership style of the Party and the people's government in many places has also improved. In many places, work that was easily done in the past by rushing to do everything in one go after the task came down can now be done well by only a few people after the establishment of regular propaganda work. Many work cadres used to think that "establishing a propaganda network is an extra burden" and "work can still be done without establishing a propaganda network." They saw the effectiveness of the propaganda network in their actual work and also changed their views, and admitted that the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network for the people was completely correct, and believed that "propagandists are the pioneers of all work." Consolidating and developing the Party's propaganda network for the people is one of the important tasks of the leading organs of the Party at all levels.

At present, one of the important tasks of the leading organs of the Party at all levels is to further consolidate and develop the Party's propaganda network for the people, and to further consolidate and develop the Party's propaganda work for the people, in order to promote the widespread development of the movement to increase production and practice economy, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy. In order to achieve this goal, first of all, Party committees at all levels are required to generally attach importance to the work of establishing and consolidating the propaganda network. About 20% of the Party's grassroots organizations - branches - have not yet established propagandists. They should be universally established in 1952 in accordance with the provisions of the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network. Those who have the conditions for development should first learn from the experience of Daming County in Hebei, set up a group of propagandist assistants, cultivate them, and then develop steadily, with the initial goal of the number of propagandists reaching 1% of the total population of the region. The Party branch committee should convene a propagandist meeting on time to summarize their work experience; each member of the branch should be responsible for inspecting and supervising the work of the propagandists under their jurisdiction. In order to unify the Party's leadership over various mass propaganda organizations, efforts should be made to establish a unified mass propaganda team in each village and street, with Party propagandists as the backbone, and propagandists and propaganda team members should be responsible for mastering various propaganda tools and conducting regular propaganda work to the people with fixed targets. The Party district committee should, under the leadership of the county committee, hold training classes for propagandists who do not leave production, and conduct basic training for all propagandists once within a certain period of time; at the same time, it is necessary to focus on doing a good job of regularly imparting propaganda content to all propagandists. In addition to helping and supervising the district committees under its jurisdiction to regularly do the above work, the Party county committee should also convene joint meetings of branch secretaries and representative meetings of propagandists on time. The committees of provinces, cities, and administrative regions should issue propaganda points once a month or two and run the "Propagandist Handbook" well. Party committees at all levels should simultaneously arrange propaganda work when arranging central work; they should also inspect the work of the propaganda network when going to the countryside and factories to inspect work. Party committees at all levels should urge the reporters under their jurisdiction to report to the people on time in accordance with the provisions of the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network, and at the same time impart propaganda content to the propagandists. Party committees above the district level that have not established reporters should quickly and universally establish them.

    党的宣传网一年来发展的情况和今后进一步巩固和发展的目标
    中共中央在一九五一年一月一日发布了“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”，到今天整整一年了。各地中国共产党的组织，已经根据这个决定，建立了和加强了群众宣传工作。到一九五一年十二月，据不完全统计，全国已有宣传员一百九十二万多人。其中，华北区有六十万零六千多人；东北区有三十万多人；华东区有六十五万多人；中南区有二十三万六千多人；西南区有八万五千多人；西北区有三万多人。以省为单位来说，宣传员的数目，以河北、山东两省为最多，各在三十三万人以上；宣传员和全区总人口的百分比，以河北、察哈尔两省为最大，都超过全省人口百分之一；山西和山东两省也接近百分之一。全国各地党的区委以上的各级领导机关，大多数都已设立报告员。目前全国已有党的报告员五万多人。党的报告员和宣传员，还把大批的群众宣传积极分子团结在自己的周围，组成了庞大的群众宣传队伍。有些地方党组织可以经常动员的宣传力量，已达到总人口的百分之十五以上。党的报告员宣传员所进行的巨大活动对于推动各项中心工作起了很大作用
    党的五万多报告员，绝大多数都能按时向人民群众作报告。仅东北区，听过报告员报告的人民群众，累计就有三千多万人。华东区各级党的报告员，据不完全的统计，也已向一千九百七十九万以上的人民群众作了报告。党的基层组织所设立的一百九十二万多宣传员，大部分也是能起作用的，只有小部分不起作用。在各省市的宣传员中，经常起作用的，以河北省、上海市较多。河北省的宣传员经常起作用的占全省宣传员总数的百分之六十七，起作用但不经常的占百分之二十七，不起作用的仅占百分之六，上海市的宣传员经常起作用的占全市宣传员总数的百分之五十二，起作用但不经常的占百分之四十二，不起作用的仅占百分之六。
    党的报告员和宣传员所进行的巨大活动，对于推动抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革、加强国防和增产节约等项中心工作的发展，起了很大作用。人民群众把报告员和宣传员叫做“问事处”、“思想大夫”和“毛主席的传话人”。许多地方原来的工作推不动，由于建立了宣传网，根据人民群众的思想情况进行了大规模的宣传工作，提高了人民群众的政治觉悟和革命热情，就帮助造成了这些地方的工作的转变，使党和人民政府与人民群众的关系变为密切。由于建立了宣传网，经常使用宣传的方法来推动工作，许多地方党的和人民政府的领导作风也改善了。许多地方，过去任务一来，大家一揽子去突击也容易做好的工作，在建立了经常的宣传工作以后，只要少数人去做就可以做好了。许多工作干部过去认为“建立宣传网是额外负担”、“不建立宣传网，工作也可以照样做”；他们在实际工作中看到了宣传网的成效，也改变了自己的看法，而承认党中央关于建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定，是完全正确的，并认为“宣传员是一切工作的开路先锋”了。巩固和发展党对人民群众的宣传网是各级党的领导机关的重要任务之一
    目前各级党的领导机关的重要任务之一，就是进一步巩固和发展党对人民群众的宣传网，进一步巩固和发展党对人民群众的宣传工作，以便推动增产节约、反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的普遍开展。为了达到这个目的，首先要求各级党委普遍重视建立和巩固宣传网的工作。党的基层组织——支部现在还有百分之二十左右没有建立宣传员，应该在一九五二年内根据中央关于建立宣传网的决定的规定，普遍建立；凡有发展条件的，应该首先仿照河北大名县的经验，设立一批宣传员的助手，加以培养，然后稳步发展，而以宣传员数目达到占全区总人口的百分之一为初步目标。党的支部委员会应该按时召开宣传员大会，总结他们的工作经验；支部各委员应分工负责检查、督促所属宣传员的工作。为了统一党对各种群众宣传组织的领导，应该争取在每个村庄、街道建立统一的以党的宣传员为骨干的群众宣传队，并由宣传员和宣传队员分工负责地掌握各种宣传工具，并固定对象地向人民群众进行经常的宣传工作。党的区委，应该在县的委员会的领导下，举办不脱离生产的宣传员训练班，在一定期限内对所有宣传员普遍进行一次基本训练；同时要着重地做好向所有宣传员按时传授宣传内容的工作。党的县委除应帮助和督促所属区委经常做好上述工作以外，并应按时召开支部书记联席会议和宣传员代表会议。党的省、市和行署区的委员会，应该每月或两月发布一次宣传要点，办好“宣传员手册”。各级党委在布置中心工作时，都应同时布置宣传工作；下乡下厂检查工作时都应同时检查宣传网的工作。各级党委都应督促所属报告员，按照中央关于建立宣传网的决定的规定，按时向人民群众作报告，同时向宣传员传授宣传内容。区级以上党委凡没有设立报告员的，都应迅速普遍设立起来。
