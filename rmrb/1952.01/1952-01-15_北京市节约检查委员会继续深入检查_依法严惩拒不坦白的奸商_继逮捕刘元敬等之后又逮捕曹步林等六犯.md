Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: The Beijing Municipal Commission for Thrift Examination continues to deepen its investigation into illegal activities in the industrial and commercial sectors, such as bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets. Following the lawful arrest on the 12th of Liu Yuanjing and five other criminals who refused to confess and sabotaged national defense construction by stealing over 8 billion yuan in state assets, on the 13th and 14th, six more illegal merchants were arrested who had consistently engaged in bribery, smuggling, tax evasion, and theft of state assets, and who dared to undermine the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. They are Cao Bulin, manager of Hongchangde Hardware Store; Feng Yangfu, manager of Yangfu Automobile Repair Shop; Yu Chengjing, manager of Xianle Import and Export Trading Company; Wang Yuheng, manager of Yusheng Construction Factory; Liu Changxin, manager of Huaxin Lumber Mill; and Li Ziqing, manager of Taishangong Coal Factory. In order to achieve their goal of seeking exorbitant profits, Cao Bulin and the other six criminals used various despicable means, such as "honey traps," to seduce and bribe cadres. Such serious criminal acts that endanger the country and the people should have been punished according to law. However, the People's Government, in order to give these illegal industrial and commercial households an opportunity to reform themselves, repeatedly held meetings to mobilize them, calling on them to thoroughly confess in this movement. Not only did they not repent, but they also colluded with corrupt elements to sabotage the movement, and they remained cunning and resisted during the investigation. Therefore, the Municipal People's Government decided to arrest them.

Cao Bulin, manager of Hongchangde Hardware Store, gained the trust of purchasing personnel from government agencies and enterprises after liberation through deceptive means, and then used methods such as "kickbacks," "loans," "gifts," and "introducing partners" to lure people into corruption, with dozens of people having accepted his bribes. Yang Shanzheng and Liu Chongxi, cadres of the Seventh Branch of the Municipal Taxation Bureau, colluded with each other and had so-called "shares" in Cao's business. Once the Municipal Taxation Bureau was to audit the accounts, Yang and Liu would notify him in advance. Since liberation, Cao has relied on this relationship to evade taxes by creating false accounts and claiming peddler status to avoid taxes. In 1950 alone, his tax evasion reached 300 million yuan. After the launch of this movement, Cao actively engaged in sabotage activities, agreed with bribe-takers to confess minor offenses while concealing major ones, attempted to use money to buy off shop employees and workers, and engaged in false confessions and false accusations with accountants Hu Shoumin and Du Zigao. Feng Yangfu, manager of Yangfu Automobile Repair Shop, extensively bribed automobile drivers from government agencies and colluded with them to steal public gasoline and automobile parts. According to preliminary materials, seventeen automobile drivers from thirteen departments of the Central People's Government received bribes from Feng, and stole 280 gallons of gasoline. Feng also took the opportunity of repairing automobiles for government agencies to steal valuable parts, using these parts to assemble six jeeps, which he sold for 500 million yuan. In addition, Feng also used various methods to evade taxes, with the tax evasion from January to August 1951 alone amounting to over 180 million yuan. As soon as this movement was launched, the Municipal People's Government received many letters reporting Feng's crimes, and the evidence was solid. However, Feng still refused to confess even when the inspection team arrived at his business. Yu Chengjing, manager of Xianle Import and Export Trading Company, was even more cunning. After liberation, he pretended to be progressive, using every opportunity to approach cadres, giving them watches, pens, and other items as bribes, sending them again if they refused the first time, until he dragged them into corruption. Then, through these corrupt officials, he engaged in large-scale smuggling, tax evasion, and theft of state assets. In 1950, Yu, using the name of "Jianyu Company," signed a contract with the Tianjin Construction Company to smuggle 200 tons of asphalt from Hong Kong. At that time, when the price of asphalt rose, Yu delivered only 50 tons of asphalt in place of the 200 tons, and sold the remaining asphalt at a high price, obtaining a huge profit of 90 million yuan. There were many similar illegal activities. However, since the launch of the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in the Beijing industrial and commercial sector, Yu has consistently refused to tell the truth. Wang Yuheng, manager of Yusheng Construction Factory, bribed cadres, stole bid prices, evaded taxes, used substandard materials, and stole state assets. In one project alone, he used miscellaneous wood instead of 60 cubic meters of red pine, obtaining a huge profit of 100 million yuan, and in another project he stole 700 bags of cement. During the movement, Wang not only did not confess, but also used various methods to resist the movement, hiding his account books in a hole behind the wall of his manager's office. Liu Changxin, manager of Huaxin Lumber Mill, in order to achieve his goal of stealing economic intelligence and obtaining huge profits, did not hesitate to use his concubine to seduce Meng Xuezeng, a cadre of the Beijing Grain Company, and successively bribed Meng Xuezeng and Shang Zhenwu with more than 21 taels of gold. After Meng and Shang leaked information, Liu gained a huge profit of 53 million yuan in 1949 just from running errands for the Grain Company, which is equivalent to 1.8 billion yuan at the then current rice price; and another 1 billion yuan in 1950. During this movement, Liu refused to confess and threatened shop employees and workers not to report him. Li Ziqing, manager of Taishangong Coal Factory, in order to steal state assets, did not hesitate to use various despicable means to seduce staff members of government agencies. At the end of 1949, when the public bus company established a depot near his factory, Li successively bribed Zhu Yangqu and Sun Decheng, employees of the company. After establishing the relationship, he stole state assets by mixing coal dust in charcoal and adding an extra 10% during weighing. After the start of this movement, Li not only did not repent and confess, but also threatened the bribe-takers, saying: "I lead more than 100 coal households, everyone knows that routine!" These illegal merchants who refused to confess and seriously harmed the interests of the state finally fell into the net of the law.

    北京市节约检查委员会继续深入检查
    依法严惩拒不坦白的奸商
    继逮捕刘元敬等之后又逮捕曹步林等六犯
    【新华社十四日讯】北京市节约检查委员会继续深入检查工商界中的行贿、偷税、盗骗国家资财等不法行为。除十二日依法逮捕拒不坦白的破坏国防建设盗骗国家资财八十多亿元的刘元敬等五犯外，十三、十四两日又先后逮捕了一贯行贿、走私、偷税、盗骗国家资财并敢于破坏反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的六个不法商人，即鸿昌德五金行经理曹步林、仰富汽车修理行经理冯仰富、仙乐进出口贸易行经理俞诚景、裕升营造厂经理王毓珩、华新木厂经理刘常馨、泰山公煤炭厂经理李子清。曹步林等六犯为了达到其追求暴利的目的，竟用种种卑鄙手段，例如“美人计”等等，来勾引和贿赂干部。这种严重的危害国家危害人民的罪恶行为，本该依法制裁，但是人民政府为了给予这些不法工商户以改过自新的机会，一再开会动员，号召他们在这次运动中彻底坦白交代。他们不仅不悔悟，反而串通贪污受贿分子破坏运动，在检查时仍然狡猾抵赖，因此市人民政府决定予以逮捕。
    鸿昌德五金行经理曹步林，解放后以欺骗手段取得机关企业采购人员的信任，然后以“回扣”、
    “借钱”、“送礼”、“介绍对象”等方式拉人下水，计先后受其贿赂的有几十人之多。市税务局七分局干部杨善政、刘崇熙等，互相勾结在曹犯生意中有所谓“入股”，一旦市税务局要来查账，杨、刘等即预先通风报信。解放以来，曹犯即依靠这种关系，以造假账，座商报行商等方式偷税，仅一九五零年即偷税达三亿元。这次运动开展后，曹犯积极进行破坏活动，与受贿分子相约谈小留大，企图拿钱收买店员工人，并与司账胡寿民、杜子镐等进行假坦白假检举。仰富汽车修理行经理冯仰富，向政府机关汽车司机大量行贿，并相互勾结盗窃公家的汽油和汽车零件。据初步材料，中央人民政府十三个部门十七个汽车司机都受了冯犯的贿赂，盗窃汽油二百八十加仑。冯犯并利用给政府机关修理汽车的机会盗窃贵重零件，用这些零件装配成六辆吉普车，以五亿元的价格出售。此外，冯犯并用种种方法偷税，仅在一九五一年一月至八月间所偷税款已查明者即达一亿八千多万元。这次运动刚一开展，市人民政府即接到许多检举冯犯的信件，证据确凿，可是直至检查组到该行检查时，冯犯仍拒不坦白。仙乐进出口贸易行经理俞诚景更是狡猾成性，解放后假装进步，利用一切机会接近干部，送手表、钢笔等物行贿，一次不收再送一次，直至把对方拉下水为止。然后他就通过这些贪污受贿分子，大肆走私、偷税、盗骗国家资财。一九五零年，俞犯曾以“建余公司”的名义与天津建筑公司订立合同，从香港走私运进二百吨沥青，当时适逢沥青涨价，俞犯即以五十吨沥青代替二百吨沥青交货，并将所余的沥青高价出售，获得暴利九千万元。诸如此类的不法行为甚多。可是自从北京市工商界开展反贪污反行贿运动至今，俞犯始终坚不吐实。裕升营造厂经理王毓珩向干部行贿、偷买标底、偷漏税款、偷工减料、盗骗国家资财，仅在某项工程中，以杂木代替红松木六十方米，获暴利一亿元，在另一项工程盗窃洋灰七百袋。在运动中王犯不仅不坦白交代，还施用种种手法来抵抗运动，将账本藏在其经理室板墙后的洞内。华新木厂经理刘常馨，为了达到其窃取经济情报获取暴利的目的，不惜以其小老婆勾引北京市粮食公司干部孟学曾，并先后向孟学曾及尚振武行贿二十一两黄金以上，经过孟、尚等人通风报信，刘犯在一九四九年仅给粮食公司跑合一项即获暴利五千三百万元，按当时米价折合约值现在的十八亿元；一九五零年又得十亿元。这次运动中刘犯拒不坦白，并威胁店员工人不准检举。泰山公煤炭厂经理李子清为了盗骗国家资财，不惜以种种卑鄙手段勾引机关工作人员，一九四九年底公共汽车公司在该厂附近建立车厂，李犯先后向该公司职员朱仰渠、孙德成等人行贿，建立关系后便以在木炭中掺炭末及过秤时加一成等方法盗骗国家资财。这次运动开始后，李犯不仅不悔过坦白，反而威胁受贿人说：“我领导一百多煤炭户，谁不知道那一套！”这些拒不坦白的严重损害国家利益的不法商人终于落入了法网。
