    On the Front Lines of the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy
    The Central Ministry of Light Industry Investigates and Punishes Corrupt Elements
    From November 28th of last year to January 14th of this year, in a period of 48 days, the Central Ministry of Light Industry and its directly subordinate units have discovered many corrupt elements. A small number of these corrupt elements confessed voluntarily at the beginning, and it has been announced that these individuals will receive appropriate reductions in their punishment. The majority of corrupt elements confessed only after conclusive evidence was presented and they could no longer deny their crimes, finally admitting their guilt under pressure from the masses. A small number of corrupt elements involved in major cases, such as Zhu Lida and Cao Kejia, refused to confess even after being investigated and exposed. After being struggled against in mass meetings on December 26th of last year, they have been arrested and brought to justice by the People's Court. Now the ministry's movement should further eliminate the big corrupt elements.

    The Central Ministry of Health Holds a Struggle Meeting Against Corruption
    Corrupt Official Zhang Yingmin Arrested for Refusing to Confess
    The Central Ministry of Health held a struggle meeting against corruption on January 14th. Corrupt official Zhang Yingmin, who stubbornly refused to confess, was arrested on the spot, powerfully striking back against the attacks of bourgeois decadent ideology.
    Zhang Yingmin was an auditor in the Administrative and Financial Department of the Central Ministry of Health. He colluded with private merchants, sold construction bid prices, embezzled construction funds, and accepted bribes from unscrupulous merchants. During this movement, despite repeated enlightenment, education, and assistance from his comrades, he remained steadfastly unwilling to tell the truth. The day before the struggle meeting (January 13th), working comrades from the ministry's Branch of the Economy Inspection Committee spoke with him for nine hours, but he continued to argue and deny, even pretending to write a statement on the spot asserting his innocence, using the words "If I am corrupt, shoot me" as a shield. At the struggle meeting, Zhang Yingmin still stuttered and failed to confess thoroughly. The masses could no longer tolerate it, and they went on stage one after another to expose his crimes of selling state secrets, colluding with private merchants to embezzle and accept bribes, and demanded that he be immediately handed over to the court for punishment. The ministry's Branch of the Economy Inspection Committee accepted the demands of the masses and immediately arrested the corrupt official Zhang Yingmin, sending him to the court for legal sanctions. All localities should convene struggle meetings for a certain period of time to investigate, expose, and punish major corrupt elements.
    The Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement in Shaanxi Provincial Organs
    Has Not Yet Been Launched
    The basic situation of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy rectification movement in the Shaanxi provincial-level organs is currently as follows: the leadership's determination is insufficient, and the masses' confidence is not high, so the movement has always appeared weak and lacks momentum. The main reason is that leading comrades at all levels have not taken sufficient responsibility, conducted self-criticisms, and taken personal action. Among the five section chiefs of the Provincial People's Bank, only one was able to somewhat link his own ideology and work style to his self-criticism. Therefore, activists in the bank publicly demanded that the leadership express its attitude at the meeting: "Is it really possible to solve the problem?" Activists in some other units also expressed dissatisfaction because the leadership's attitude was unclear. As for the general masses, due to the lack of firm leadership, they are full of doubts.
    At the same time, suppressing democracy and resisting the rectification still exists seriously in some units. There are three manifestations: the first is open attacks. The second is passive resistance. The third is to remain silent, regardless of whether the opinions you raise are correct or not, and refuse to express any attitude.
    In response to this situation, Ma Dingbang, director of the Provincial Economy Inspection Committee, pointed out in his summary that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Shaanxi provincial-level organs has not yet been launched. The key to moving the movement forward lies mainly in the leadership. He demanded that leading cadres at all levels attach importance to this movement, set an example, take personal action, and do a good job in mobilizing the masses.
    Hubei's Various Special Districts and Cities Conclude Democratic Inspections
    The Struggle Turns to Corrupt Elements and Illegal Merchants
    Various units under the jurisdiction of seven special administrative offices and cities, including Xiaogan and Yichang in Hubei Province, have successively and victoriously concluded the stage of democratic inspection of leadership, and the focus of the mass struggle has gradually shifted to corrupt elements and illegal merchants who steal state property. For example, in the past three days, units under the jurisdiction of the Xiaogan Special Administrative Office have had 64 corrupt elements exposed by the masses; 26 people in the Huasha Fabric Company of the Daye Special District have confessed to their embezzlement and bribery. Facts have proved that the situation of illegal merchants bribing cadres and stealing state property is also quite serious in various medium and small cities. For example, Zhang Falang, deputy manager of the Huangshi Municipal Public Brick and Tile Company, accepted bribes worth 2.3 million yuan in kind from local coal merchants, causing the state to lose 8.1 million yuan in property in a single transaction; private construction contractors defrauded the Huanggang Special Administrative Office's Grain Bureau and Tax Bureau, etc., of 350 million yuan in public funds for the construction of warehouses and houses. Similar situations have also been found in other special districts and municipal government organs.
    It is entirely correct for the Hubei region to promptly direct the struggle against corrupt elements and illegal merchants after concluding the leadership inspection.
    The Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions Mobilizes Private Enterprise Employees
    To Actively Participate in the Struggle Against Bribery, etc.
    The Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a city-wide representative conference of private enterprise employees on the 16th to mobilize private enterprise employees to actively participate in the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. The 1,600 representatives present unanimously expressed their support for the call and immediately reported 78 cases of illegal acts by unscrupulous merchants, such as tax evasion and bribery of government staff.
    At the meeting, Qu Wenrui, a worker at the private Chengfa Iron Factory, reported that the factory's workers had refused the enticement of high wages from the capitalists, forcing them to return the falsely reported processing fee of more than 20 million yuan to the government. Guo Jinfang, a clerk at the Xinfu Transportation Company, had been drawn in to help the capitalists evade taxes in the past. But after he understood that the capitalists' tax evasion harmed the interests of the country, he assisted the tax bureau in investigating 138 cases of tax evasion. Li Zhizhou, a worker at the private Dalu Rubber Factory, reported that he had ignored the capitalists' threat of "closing down the factory" and finally exposed the factory manager Xu Zhanhua for stealing materials, evading taxes, and bribing cadres when processing goods for state-owned stores.
    All localities should refer to Shenyang's experience and mobilize the working class to participate in this great political struggle.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    中央轻工业部追查和法办贪污分子
    中央人民政府轻工业部及其直属单位从去年十一月二十八日到今年一月十四日的四十八天中，已发现了许多贪污分子。其中一小部分贪污分子是在开始时自动坦白的，这些人的处分已被宣布将受到适当的减免；一大部分的贪污分子则是因为罪证确凿，无法抵赖，最后在群众的追究下才承认的；还有少数案情重大，经查获后仍拒不坦白的贪污分子如朱立达、曹克家等，则已于去年十二月二十六日经过群众大会斗争之后，已由人民法院逮捕法办。现在该部运动应当进一步清除大贪污分子。
            （中央轻工业部新闻报道组）
    中央卫生部举行反贪污斗争大会
    贪污犯张英敏拒不坦白被逮捕
    中央人民政府卫生部一月十四日举行反贪污斗争大会。当场逮捕了执迷不悟拒不坦白的贪污分子张英敏，有力地回击了资产阶级腐朽思想的进攻。
    张英敏是中央卫生部行政财务处的审计。他勾结私商，出卖修建标底，贪污修建费，接受奸商贿赂。在这次运动中，虽经过同志们多次的启发教育和帮助，他仍坚不吐实。斗争大会的前一天（一月十三日），该部节约检查委员会分会的工作同志和他作了九小时的谈话，但他一直是强辩抵赖，并装腔作势地要当场写出没有贪污的字据，以“如有贪污，枪毙我”的话，来作挡箭牌。斗争大会上，张英敏仍吞吞吐吐，不彻底坦白。群众再也不能容忍了，纷纷走上台去揭发他的出卖国家机密、勾结私商贪污受贿的罪恶，并要求当场将他送交法院惩办。该部节约检查委员会分会接受了群众要求，当场逮捕了贪污犯张英敏，送交法院依法制裁。各地在一定时期都应该召开斗争大会追查检举和惩办大贪污分子。
    陕西省级机关反贪污反浪费
    反官僚主义运动还没有展开
    目前陕西省一级机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的整风运动的基本情况是：领导决心不够，群众信心不高，因而运动始终显得声势不壮，劲头不足。主要原因是各级首长负责、层层检讨亲自动手不够。省人民银行五个科长中，只有一个稍能联系自己的思想作风进行检讨的，因而该银行积极分子在会议上公开要求领导表明态度：“是不是真能解决问题？”其他有些单位的积极分子也因为领导态度不明朗而表示不满。至于一般群众，由于领导上不够坚定，而疑虑重重。
    同时，压制民主和对整风采取对抗的情绪，在某些单位也还严重地存在着。其表现形态有三：第一种是公开进行打击。第二种是消极怠工。第三种就是不说话，任凭你提什么意见，提的对与不对，概不表示态度。
    针对这种情况，省节约检查委员会主任马定邦在作总结时指出，陕西省级各机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动还没发动起来，把运动向前推进一步的关键，主要在于领导。要求各级领导干部重视这个运动，以身作则，亲自动手，做好发动群众的工作。
    湖北各专区、市结束民主检查
    斗争转向贪污分子和不法商人
    湖北省已有孝感、宜昌等七个专署和市所属各单位先后胜利地结束了民主检查领导的阶段，群众斗争的锋芒逐步转向贪污分子及盗窃国家财产的不法商人。如孝感专署所属各机关在最近三天时间内便由群众检举出六十四个贪污分子；大冶专区花纱布公司已有二十六人坦白了自己贪污、受贿行为。事实证明：不法商人贿赂干部、盗窃国家财产的情况在各中、小城市中也相当严重。如黄石市公营砖瓦公司副经理张发良因接受了当地煤商贿赂价值等于二百三十万元的实物，仅在一次交易中就使国家财产损失了八百一十万元；黄冈专署粮食局、税务局等四个单位修建仓库、房屋，被私营营造厂商人骗去公款三亿五千万元。其他专区和市级政府机关也发现同类情况。
    湖北地区在结束领导检查后及时地把斗争锋芒指向贪污分子和不法商人是完全正确的。
    沈阳总工会动员私营企业职工
    积极参加反行贿等斗争
    沈阳市总工会在十六日召开全市私营企业职工代表大会，动员私营企业职工积极参加反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料和盗窃国家经济情报的斗争。到会的一千六百名代表一致表示响应号召，当场检举奸商偷税、贿赂政府工作人员等不法行为七十八件。
    会上私营成发铁工厂工人曲文瑞报告了该厂工人曾拒绝资方高额工资的利诱，迫使资方将虚报的两千多万元加工费退还给政府的情形。新孚运输行店员郭锦芳过去曾受拉拢，帮助资方偷税。但他明白了资方偷税就是危害国家的利益的道理后，就协助税务局查获了一百三十八件偷税案。私营大陆橡胶厂的工人李之周报告了他不顾资方“关门停工”的威胁，终于检举了该厂经理许占华在替国营商店加工时偷料、偷税、贿赂干部的情形。
    各地应当参考沈阳的经验，发动工人阶级参加这一伟大政治斗争。
