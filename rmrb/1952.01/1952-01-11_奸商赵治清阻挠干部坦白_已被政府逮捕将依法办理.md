    Treacherous Merchant Zhao Zhiqing Obstructs Cadre Confessions
    Has Been Arrested by the Government and Will Be Dealt With According to Law
    Zhao Zhiqing, an illegal merchant from Beijing (salesman for Da Zhonghua Soap Factory), used various methods in the past to bribe cadres in government agencies. During this anti-corruption movement, he used threats to prevent cadres from confessing. After being exposed by Guo Tiansheng, a cadre of the Fifth District United Cooperative of Beijing, Zhao Zhiqing has been arrested by the government and will be dealt with according to law.
    Guo Tiansheng is a purchasing agent for the Fifth District United Cooperative, and he had dealings with the private Da Zhonghua Soap Factory due to business relations. Zhao Zhiqing often courted him, inviting him to dinner, movies, giving him soap to use, and lending him over 200,000 yuan in installments. Initially, Guo Tiansheng was unwilling to deal with him. Gradually, he felt that Zhao was very "generous," "magnanimous," and a "good friend." Therefore, every time the cooperative approved the purchase of soap, Guo Tiansheng would buy it from the Da Zhonghua Soap Factory. Later, Guo Tiansheng knew that what he was doing was wrong, and wanted to return the money to Zhao Zhiqing. But he was refused several times.
    When the cooperative launched a rectification and study movement, Guo Tiansheng wanted to confess this problem to the organization. Because he was afraid that Zhao Zhiqing would not agree, he first asked Zhao Zhiqing: "What should I do?" Zhao threatened him, saying, "It won't do you any good to talk about it. I will also end up in court." He also scared him by saying that a cadre had confessed to borrowing money from Zhao Zhiqing, but Zhao Zhiqing bit him back, resulting in him being sent to court. This scared Guo Tiansheng so much that he didn't dare to confess to the organization.
    After the anti-corruption movement was launched, Guo Tiansheng wanted to confess this problem again. But thinking of Zhao Zhiqing, he was afraid that Zhao Zhiqing would turn around and bite him several times. So he went to Zhao Zhiqing again. Zhao Zhiqing still said the same thing: "It won't do you any good to talk about it!" And he threatened him, saying, "There are twenty or thirty cadres like you in my hands!" Guo Tiansheng was scared again. But after several mobilizations by the leadership, Guo Tiansheng, after ideological struggle, thought that now he had the support of the People's Government, and mustered up the courage to confess his facts of corruption and bribery to the organization, and exposed Zhao Zhiqing's crimes.

    奸商赵治清阻挠干部坦白
    已被政府逮捕将依法办理
    北京市不法商人赵治清（大中华肥皂厂推销员），过去曾用种种方法向政府机关干部行贿。在这次反贪污运动中，他又用威胁手段阻止干部坦白。经北京市合作社第五区联合社干部郭天盛揭发后，赵治清已被政府逮捕，将依法办理。
    郭天盛是合作社第五区联合社的采购员，因为业务关系，和私营大中华肥皂厂有来往。赵治清经常拉拢他，请他去吃饭、看电影，送胰子给他用，还陆续借给他二十几万元。起初，郭天盛也不愿意跟他打交道。慢慢地，他就觉得赵很“大方”“慷慨”“够朋友”。于是合作社每次批购肥皂，郭天盛就向大中华肥皂厂去买。后来郭天盛知道自己干的事儿不对，便要还赵治清的钱。但是好几次都被拒绝了。
    合作社展开整风学习运动时，郭天盛想向组织交代这个问题。因为害怕赵治清不愿意，于是就先问了一下赵治清：“怎么办？”赵就威胁他说：“你要谈出来，对你没有好处，我也要蹲法院。”还吓唬他说有一个干部谈出了跟赵治清借钱的事情，被赵治清反“咬”一口，结果送了法院。这就把郭天盛吓得没敢向组织坦白。
    这次展开反贪污运动后，郭天盛又想交代这个问题。但是想起赵治清，就害怕到时候赵治清反过来乱“咬”他几口。他就又去找赵治清。赵治清还是那句话：“谈了对你没有好处！”并威胁他说：“像这样的干部在我手里的就有二三十个！”郭天盛又给吓住了。但是经过领导方面几次动员，郭天盛经过思想斗争，想到现在有人民政府撑腰，就鼓起勇气向组织坦白了自己的贪污受贿事实，揭发了赵治清的罪行。　（辜坚）
