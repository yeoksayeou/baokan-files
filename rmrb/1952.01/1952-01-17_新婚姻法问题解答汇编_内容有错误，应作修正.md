    "Compilation of Answers to Questions on the New Marriage Law" Contains Errors and Should Be Corrected

    Comrade Editor: After reading "Compilation of Answers to Questions on the New Marriage Law" edited by Wang Nai (published by Cultural Supply Cooperative, distributed by Joint Bookstore, reprinted in November 1950), I feel that there are several issues worth discussing:

    I. Regarding the issue of whether the government should allow a woman to divorce and remarry when her husband has been away for a long time and there is no news of him, the original book answers (page 53): "If the husband has been away for more than four years without any news... as long as she is willing to find another partner and applies to the government, the government should approve it...
    (May 6th, Shanxi Daily)" This answer lacks a correct basis. Because the husband has been away from home for four years without communication, it does not necessarily mean that he has died. If the woman requests a divorce, she can apply to the court. The court should use newspaper advertisements or other methods to publicly search for him in order to obtain the man's reply or defense. Only if there is no news within a certain period can a divorce be granted.

    II. Regarding the issue of support for children born out of wedlock, the original book answers (page 72): "If the child is indeed not fathered by the husband, then the husband is not responsible for the obligations that a father should bear, and the necessary living and education expenses for the child should be borne in part or in full by the confirmed biological father... (Excerpt from a reply to Zhi Bai in the June 15th Guangming Daily)" If the husband is willing to raise the child, why can't he adopt the child as a foster father?

    III. Regarding the issue of how to handle property when a man and woman end their cohabitation relationship, the original book answers (page 80): "As for the property issue, because cohabitation without marriage is illegal, the law cannot guarantee the same property treatment as in a divorce... (May 9th, Xinhua Daily reply to Liu Liangbin. Editor's note: refers to Chongqing Xinhua Daily)" Although cohabitation lacks the legal formalities of marriage, it fully possesses the relationship between husband and wife in other aspects, such as joint labor and raising children. If the woman's property is not protected, wouldn't it harm the woman?

    IV. Regarding the issue of whether a child bride is allowed to find another partner after the man joins the army, the original book answers (page 92): "According to Article 2 of the Marriage Law, which 'prohibits child brides,' she is allowed to find another partner. (July 27th, Shanxi Daily)" Because the man is an active-duty revolutionary soldier, does this answer take into account the provisions of Article 19 of the Marriage Law?

    V. Regarding the issue of whether a house divided to one party after a divorce can be demolished, the original book answers (page 105): "As long as the property is owned by one party, he or she has the right to freely dispose of the property they have been allocated. (September 15th, Shandong Dazhong Daily)" This is incorrect. Because the house allocated to one party should not be demolished and taken away, this not only violates the spirit of protecting buildings but may even affect the existence of the other party's buildings.

    Reader Li Nai

    Editor's Note: We have forwarded this letter to the Ministry of Justice of the Central People's Government and solicited the Ministry of Justice's opinion. The Ministry of Justice explains as follows: "The original book's answer to the first question is inappropriate. Because a divorce cannot be granted simply because one party firmly demands a divorce; it must be reviewed and judged by the People's Court. Before the People's Court has ruled on the divorce, the district and township people's governments cannot arbitrarily approve any party's request to find another partner. The answer to the second question is inconsistent with the provisions of the Marriage Law establishing new family kinship and new social moral standards. 'Children born out of wedlock' are a result of the lack of freedom in marriage in the old society. All children are members of society and citizens of the nation, and people's democratic countries and new democratic societies should provide them with equal protection. The spirit of Article 15 of the Marriage Law is to pay attention to the protection of infants and children. Of course, the husband can raise children born out of wedlock if he is willing; even if the husband is unwilling to raise them, he should still be responsible until their biological father takes them in. Li Nai's view that the husband can act as a foster father is also inappropriate. The answer to the third question is incorrect. Cohabitation based on common life and labor production is a de facto marriage resulting from the lack of freedom in marriage under the old system and cannot be completely separated from marriage in form. The People's Court can provide reasonable protection for the woman's property based on the specific circumstances. On this issue, both the original book and Li Nai have the idea that 'cohabitation is illegal,' which is inappropriate. Because this is a long-term education issue in the struggle against the feudal marriage system, we should also distinguish between cohabitation before and after the promulgation of the Marriage Law. The answer to the fourth question only starts from the provisions of Article 2 of the Marriage Law and does not consider the issue more comprehensively. Although child brides are expressly prohibited by the Marriage Law, in order to take care of active-duty revolutionary soldiers, if the woman proposes to terminate the child bride relationship and 'find another partner,' it should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 19 of the Marriage Law. The answer to the fifth question is obviously an old legal point of view and is incorrect because it ignores the more important aspect of protecting social property."

    The main shortcomings of this book are that it does not analyze and synthesize the answers to questions about the Marriage Law that have been collected, some places take things out of context, some places confuse general principles with the handling of individual issues, and some places are too simple and broad, which can easily mislead people. We hope that the editors of this book will pay attention to correction.

### “新婚姻法问题解答汇编”内容有错误，应作修正

    “新婚姻法问题解答汇编”内容有错误，应作修正
    编辑同志：我读了王乃总编“新婚姻法问题解答汇编”（文化供应社出版、联营书店发行、一九五○年十一月再版）一书，觉得其中有几个问题值得商讨：
    一、关于丈夫外去，长期无消息，政府应否准许女方离婚改嫁问题，原书解答（五三页）：“丈夫跑到外面既有四年多没有音讯，……只要自己愿意另找对象，向政府申请，政府是应该批准的。……
    （五月六日山西日报）”这样解答是缺乏正确根据的。因为丈夫离家四年没有通讯，并不一定已经死亡，如果女方要求离婚是可以的，向法院申请后，法院应用登报或其他方式公开寻找，以期得到男方的答复或答辩，在一定时期内没有音讯，才能准许离婚。
    二、关于非婚生子女的抚养问题，原书解答（七二页）：“如该小孩确非丈夫所生，则丈夫对该小孩即不负父亲所应负的责任，而该小孩所必需的生活费和教育费，即应由已经证实了的生父负担一部或全部……。（摘自六月十五日光明日报答复芝白一信）”如果丈夫愿意抚养的话，为什么不可以作个养父来抚养这小孩呢？
    三、关于男女脱离同居关系时财产如何处理问题，原书解答（八○页）：“至于财产问题，因为未经结婚而同居是非法的，法律上不能保障和夫妻离婚时的财产同样处理。……（五月九日新华日报答刘良斌。编者按：指重庆新华日报）”同居虽缺乏夫妻的合法手续，但在其他方面，完全具备着夫妻间的关系，如共同劳动、生养子女等。对女子的财产部分若不保障，岂不损害了女方？
    四、关于童养媳在男人参军后是否允许另找对象问题，原书解答（九二页）：“根据婚姻法第二条‘禁止童养媳’的规定，是可以另找对象的。（七月二十七日山西日报）”因为男方是现役革命军人，这样的答复是否照顾了婚姻法第十九条的规定？
    五、关于离婚后一方分的房屋是否可以拆除问题，原书解答（一○五页）：“只要财产分归一方所有，那他或她都对自己分得的财产有自由处理的权利。（九月十五日山东大众日报）”这是不对的。因为分归一方的房屋是不应该拆除带走的，这不仅违背了保护建筑的精神，甚至会影响对方的建筑物存在。读者　李奈
    编者按：我们曾把这封信转给中央人民政府司法部，征求司法部的意见。司法部解释如次：“原书对第一个问题的解答是不妥当的。因为离婚不是一方坚决要求离婚，就可以离婚的；必须经过人民法院审酌与判决；在未经人民法院判决离婚前，区、乡人民政府也不能迳予批准当事人的任何一方，随便另找对象。第二个问题的解答与婚姻法建立新家庭亲属关系和新社会道德准则的规定不合。‘非婚生子’是旧社会男女婚姻不自由产生的一部分结果，一切子女都是社会的组成员与国民的一分子，人民民主国家和新民主主义社会都应加以同等的保护。婚姻法第十五条的精神是注意保护婴儿和儿童。丈夫愿意抚养非婚生子女当然是可以的；就是丈夫不愿抚养，如在其生父未接养前，丈夫仍应负责。李奈认为丈夫可以作为养父的身份，这一观点也欠妥。第三个问题的解答是欠正确的，以共同生活、劳动生产为意志的同居，就是旧制度束缚下的婚姻不自由所产生的一种事实婚，不能仅从形式上把它与结婚截然分开看待，人民法院自可根据具体情况，予女方财产以合理保障。对这个问题，原书与李奈都有‘同居是非法’的意思，均欠妥当。因为这是对封建婚姻制度作斗争的长期教育的问题，同时应将婚姻法颁布前与颁布后的同居区别开来。第四个问题的解答只是片面地从婚姻法第二条的规定出发，而没有更全面地考虑问题。童养媳虽经婚姻法明令禁止，但为了照顾现役革命军人，如女方提出解除童养关系‘另找对象’时，应比照婚姻法第十九条的规定办理。第五个问题的解答显然是旧法观点，是不正确的，因为它忽略了保护社会财产的更重要的一面。”
    这本书的主要缺点是对于所搜集的有关婚姻法问题的解答，没有加以分析和综合，有些地方断章取义，有些地方把一般原则和个别问题的处理混淆起来，有些地方过于简单笼统，容易使人误解。希望这书的编者注意修正。
