A Brief International Commentary

    The United States is Increasingly Isolated in the United Nations
    At its meeting on the 25th of this month, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly passed the Soviet Union's proposal to recommend that the Security Council re-examine the applications of fourteen countries applying for membership in the United Nations. This is another major victory for the Soviet Union in its just struggle to strengthen international peace and cooperation in the Sixth United Nations General Assembly.
    In order to turn the United Nations into a docile tool for implementing American aggression policy, the United States has, since 1946, stubbornly and unreasonably refused to approve the admission of people's democracies such as Hungary, Bulgaria, the Mongolian People's Republic, Romania, and Albania to the United Nations in the Security Council, and insisted on only approving the admission of countries that accept American orders to the United Nations. Because the United States has adopted this discriminatory policy on the issue of new members joining the United Nations, which is completely contrary to the spirit of the United Nations Charter, it has opposed all the efforts made by the Soviet Union since the Fourth and Fifth United Nations General Assemblies to promote the admission of new members to the United Nations on a mutually acceptable basis, causing the demands of many countries to join the United Nations to remain unresolved in a reasonable manner. In the Political Committee of this United Nations General Assembly, although the United States continued to oppose the Soviet Union's just demands regarding the issue of new members joining the United Nations, it suffered a miserable failure.
    This shows that the United States is increasingly and severely isolated in the United Nations. Although the United States still holds enough means of oppression to ensure that it continues to control the United Nations, more and more facts at this session of the United Nations General Assembly prove that the moral and political "prestige" of the United States over its vassal states is rapidly declining, and this is an absolutely undeniable fact.
    Although the United States can use all its power to continue to prevent the rational resolution of the issue of new members joining the United Nations, the trend of isolation of the United States in the United Nations reflected in this issue is something that it can absolutely not save.

### 美国在联合国日趋孤立

    美国在联合国日趋孤立
    联合国大会政治委员会本月二十五日的会议，通过了苏联关于建议安全理事会重新审议批准申请加入联合国的十四个国家为会员国的提案。这是苏联在六届联合国大会中为加强国际和平与合作而进行的正义斗争所取得的又一重大胜利。
    美国为了要把联合国变为一个实行美国侵略政策的驯顺的工具，自一九四六年以来就一贯地在安全理事会中蛮横无理地拒绝批准匈牙利、保加利亚、蒙古人民共和国、罗马尼亚及阿尔巴尼亚等人民民主国家加入联合国，而主张只批准那些接受美国命令的国家加入联合国。由于美国在新会员国加入联合国的问题上采取了这种完全违背联合国宪章精神的歧视政策，因而它对于苏联自第四届和第五届联合国大会以来为了促成新会员国在彼此可以接受的基础上加入联合国所作的一切努力，都加以反对，致使许多国家加入联合国的要求，一直未得到合理的解决。在这次联合国大会的政治委员会中，美国虽然继续反对苏联关于新会员国加入联合国问题的公正主张，但是却遭到了悲惨的失败。
    这说明了美国在联合国中愈来愈严重地陷于孤立的地位。虽然，美国依旧握有足够的压迫手段，以保障它继续控制联合国。但是，在联合国大会的这届会议中，愈来愈多的事实证明着：美国对它附庸国家的道义上和政治上的“威信”正在急遽地下降着，这乃是绝对无可争辩的事实。
    美国虽然可以利用它的一切可能在联合国中继续阻止新会员国加入联合国的问题得到合理的解决，但在这个问题上所反映出的美国在联合国中的孤立趋势已是它所绝对无法挽救的了。
