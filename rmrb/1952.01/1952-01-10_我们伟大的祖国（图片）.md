    Our Great Motherland
    In order to develop our country's freshwater fish farming industry and supply the freshwater edible fish needed by people in various regions, the Central South Region Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Civil Aviation Administration have successfully transported fish fry by air from Hankou to various locations. Most of these fish fry are Chinese carp, grass carp, bighead carp, and black carp, which are unique to our country, and are all fast-growing, fat, and delicious fish. This is a scene of fish fry being loaded into the cabin from Hankou and taking off for Chongqing.

    为了发展我国淡水养鱼事业，供应各地人民所需要的淡水食用鱼类，中南区农林部和民用航空局由汉口空运鱼苗到各地已获得成功。这些鱼苗大部为我国特产的鲢、鲩、鳙、鲭等，都是生长极快、肉味肥美的鱼类。这是鱼苗从汉口装入机舱向重庆起运的情形。
