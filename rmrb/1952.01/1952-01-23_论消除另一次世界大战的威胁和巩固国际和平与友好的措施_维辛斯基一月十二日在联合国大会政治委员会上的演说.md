The First Committee is now discussing the draft resolution submitted by the Soviet delegation: "On Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Strengthen International Peace and Friendship."

The wording of this issue itself indicates its extreme importance, and this importance is particularly evident in the current tense international relations.

It should be noted that at the beginning of this session, the Soviet delegation proposed its own suggestions on this issue. In the plenary session of the Assembly, a significant part of the speeches by our delegation and other delegations, especially those cooperating with the Soviet Union, were devoted to this proposal. The Soviet delegation spoke on this issue on November 8 and November 16 of last year and also proposed new suggestions on this issue.

Two months have passed since then. During this period, the First Committee has considered several items on the Assembly's agenda, some of which are more or less related to the issues we are discussing today.

This is quite natural because, strictly speaking, all the issues discussed by the First Committee are, to some extent, related to this fundamental issue, which is to eliminate the threat of another world war and strengthen international peace and friendship. To solve this problem, it is necessary to take some measures to ensure the fulfillment of the above tasks. In discussing the draft resolutions that the First Committee has already discussed, it is, of course, impossible not to analyze the current international situation, not to determine the reasons for the unsatisfactory state of affairs in this regard, and not to avoid or reject efforts to find ways to improve the situation in accordance with the purposes and tasks of the United Nations.

However, the issues previously discussed and the issues related to those discussed today, which we must now study and decide on in discussing agenda item six, are, in our view, although very important, still only individual factors of the current issue. Therefore, what should be studied is not any individual measure, no matter how important it may be, but the entire set of measures or issues. These measures or issues not only need to be examined separately but also need to be examined together, closely together. The connection between these measures or issues is primarily determined by the goals and tasks that arise when these issues are discussed separately or comprehensively.

The significance of the draft resolution "On Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Strengthen International Peace and Friendship" is precisely this.

The increasingly frenzied pace of U.S. military buildup is driving up prices and worsening people's lives.

At the beginning of this session, the Soviet delegation pointed out that the United Nations is currently facing many important tasks, but the most important and urgent task that requires our immediate decision is to eliminate the obstacles that hinder the strengthening of international peace and cooperation and to eliminate the threat of another world war. At that time, we pointed out that in the previous period, that is, since the end of the Fifth Session of the United Nations, the international situation has become more complex both economically and politically. This has been proven by many irrefutable facts, despite the efforts of some governments and their representatives in the United Nations, especially those responsible for the worsening international situation during this period, to deny these facts and pretend not to know about them. It is useless.

It must be said that the fundamental, primary, and most important reason for the worsening international situation and the increasing tension in international relations is the aggressive policy of the Atlantic Pact led by the United States and other countries that are forced to adopt the same policy under U.S. pressure, although they simultaneously hope to gain economic and political benefits from this policy and its implementation.

Countries that follow this policy or within the scope of this policy are facing increasing difficulties, and these difficulties first affect the broad masses of the people. We have already pointed out that this situation will inevitably have such consequences. Everyone knows that the burden of taxes and military budgets falls mainly on the shoulders of the people of these countries, and the heavy burden of taxes and military budgets is the result of policies to expand military equipment, increase the military, establish new military bases and expand existing military bases, accelerate the production and accumulation of atomic weapons, and so on.

We have discussed these issues and listed many facts to illustrate the deteriorating economic situation of the world, especially the economies of England, France, Italy, West Germany, and many other countries.

Recently, the economic situation in these countries has deteriorated to such an extent that it is necessary to mention the facts related to this issue when discussing this draft resolution today. The United States is no exception in this regard. For example, the recently published report of the "National Defense" Mobilization Director Wilson to U.S. President Truman for the fourth quarter is convincing evidence. From this report, it can be clearly seen that U.S. military production is now worth about $2 billion per month, which is three times the level of 1950. These products include: heavy and medium bombers, light and medium tanks, various types of artillery, fire control equipment, radar equipment, various types of guided missiles, rockets, modern warships, and naturally, atomic energy products. However, Wilson's report points out that this is just the beginning. Therefore, it should be expected that military expenditures will continue to increase. In this regard, it should be noted that at the end of November last year, that is, only two months ago, it was this Wilson who promised that U.S. military production would reach its peak in 1953, when the value of monthly military production would approach $4 billion.

Thus, we now not only see that the costs for executing war plans, producing military equipment, expanding armed forces, and building various types of war bases in many parts of the world have greatly increased, but the United States also plans to further increase these costs in the future. I want to say here: this situation affects the vital interests of all countries. This situation also affects the interests of the Soviet Union because, as everyone knows, the U.S. leaders have publicly acknowledged that these weapons are primarily manufactured to counter the Soviet Union. Of course, all peace-loving countries are concerned about whether the military production of one country or another is expanding.

From Wilson's report, it can be concluded that the U.S. military buildup is not only continuing but is also increasingly frenzied. From Wilson's report, it is obvious that the U.S. government will also significantly increase the costs of executing war plans. This situation is directly related to the issue raised by the Soviet Union regarding measures to eliminate the threat of another war and strengthen international peace and friendship.

The United States, in order to prepare for a new war, in order to prepare for a new war under the guise of the so-called "North Atlantic defense," has taken military measures. What is the situation now? In these measures, they pay the most attention to strengthening the air force and producing atomic weapons, such as atomic cannons, tactical atomic weapons, and so on. The U.S. aircraft manufacturing industry is now almost entirely producing military products. This U.S. aircraft manufacturing industry expanded by 67% last year. This is based on official U.S. materials, which are known to be reduced. By the fourth quarter of 1951, that is, October, November, and December of last year, that is, recently, 35% of U.S. metal manufacturing was producing military products. The steel to be used for military production in the first quarter of 1952 is planned to be 600% more than in the second quarter of 1950, and many facts indicate that the steel used in this regard will further increase by the end of 1952. The situation of military consumption of aluminum and copper is the same.

From Wilson's report, it can be clearly seen that this year, due to the consequences of the war plan, the U.S. people will feel a greater shortage of civilian goods because the raw materials allocated to the production of consumer goods in the first quarter of 1952 have been significantly reduced compared to the last quarter of 1951.

All of this is the result of the expansion of military production. In the United States, military production has consumed a large amount of copper, aluminum, and other materials that are extremely important to the national economy, which were previously used for civilian production but are now used to implement war plans and meet war needs.

It should be pointed out that this situation has created an excellent opportunity for American monopolies engaged in military production to make profits. They have made astonishing profits. From the following facts, we can get an idea of this: the profits of American monopolies in 1951 were $46.2 billion per year, which is more than seven times the profits of the pre-war year 1939. During the same period, living expenses increased, taxes increased, social welfare programs were reduced, and the quality of goods deteriorated: all of this materially severely affected ordinary people, further lowering their already low standard of living.

As for the situation of rising living costs in countries following U.S. policy, we can see this from the example of France. Everyone can see how serious the economic consequences of the frenzied arms race are for France: war measures have swallowed up a huge amount of money and materials, thereby driving up living costs and continuously driving down the standard of living of the people.

Any housewife can tell you better than I can about this situation because she goes to the market every day and sees many facts there, very simple facts, I want to say these facts are understandable to everyone. The direct cause of these phenomena is the policy of the higher authorities, which strongly affects the vast majority of the lower classes of the population.

According to the latest materials from the U.S. Department of Labor, living costs in November were 88.6% higher than before the war and 10.8% higher than in June 1950 before the U.S. armed intervention in Korea.

At the end of November, the retail prices of food in the United States were 134.5% higher than before the war and 15% higher than in June 1950. At this point, it might be appropriate to mention that during this period, prices in the Soviet Union have been deliberately reduced, especially the prices of consumer goods have been reduced the most. The reason for the reduction in prices and the ability to reduce prices is precisely the inevitable result of the superiority of the Soviet economic system over the economic systems of capitalist countries.

In many industrial areas of the United States, due to the reduction in the production of consumer goods and the spread of the sweat shop system—which is as prevalent in the United States as in other capitalist countries—unemployment has become widespread. The magazine "U.S. News & World Report" on December 7 said: "In many industries, workers have been laid off, especially in the textile, apparel, and automobile industries. In fifteen regions, the unemployment situation has reached a critical level. In other ninety-three regions, there is an excess of labor." Excess labor means unemployment, that is, the supply of labor exceeds the capacity of industry, agriculture, and transportation to absorb it.

According to U.S. materials, the number of unemployed in the automobile industry alone is more than 140,000. This figure is based on official U.S. statistics, which are known to be understated.

The New York Times on December 23, 1951, said: "A gloomy New Year" awaits 120,000 unemployed in Detroit. Now "the gloomy New Year" has arrived! However, the prospects for Detroit and other industrial centers in the United States in this "New Year" are no brighter or more pleasant than in the past year. The November issue of the Chrysler United Automobile Workers Union publication "Fortress" pointed out: In the first half of the new year, the number of unemployed in Detroit may reach 200,000.

The latest official figures show that in October, the total number of unemployed in the United States was 1,616,000. This refers to those who have no work at all. If those who are "half" unemployed are also included, that is, those who have a little income (even if it is only a few hours of work per week) are also counted, then the number of unemployed would be between 7 million and 12 million, or even more. According to official U.S. figures, the three categories of those who are completely unemployed, those who work 1 to 29 hours per week, and those who are registered as employed but actually have no work total 12 million.

This is the current unemployment situation in the United States. The situation of farmers is not much better. The following facts clearly prove this: In 1951, the total income of farmers was $150 billion, much lower than the income of each year from 1946 to 1949, which was more than $195 billion, and everyone knows that the purchasing power of the dollar was much higher at that time.

Everyone knows that the U.S. ruling class had great hopes for 1950, especially in economic mobilization, but now nothing is as expected. The "prosperity" predicted by the U.S. government has proven to be false. In fact, the situation of the U.S. people is worsening. Now, as a new year begins, U.S. government officials are again making various promises and assurances to improve the economic situation of the Atlantic Pact countries, saying that expanding military production will bring economic prosperity—this is precisely the conclusion I am going to discuss on this issue. They loudly promise that increasing arms production will improve the economic situation. They openly put forward the slogan of "seeking prosperity from arms expansion" for propaganda.

These absurd principles determine their overall policy, not only explaining the economic policy of the Atlantic Pact countries led by the United States, but also explaining their overall policy; not only explaining their overall policy, but also explaining their foreign policy—this is what we are most concerned about now.

The increase in military production is truly hindering the prosperity of the country and the people. The current level of increased military production can be seen from the following facts: for example, to fully meet the needs of the war industry for nickel, civilian industry will almost not be able to consume nickel in 1952; again, after February, no working mother machines will be delivered to factories that are not engaged in so-called "defense" production.

They make the entire economic life subject to a policy based on the principle of "a strong situation," which destroys the foundation of the civilian economy and makes it impossible for the country to have economic prosperity—unless the prosperity of the country is confused with the prosperity of the monopolies that seek "a strong situation" through war orders.

Wilson, in his report, had to warn (I am quoting the relevant part of this report) that "the continued increase in defense spending remains the main cause of future inflation." He said this not by chance. At the same time, Wilson also demanded an increase in taxes.

Even these facts alone can prove that the arms race cannot promote prosperity, and instead, the countries that implement the arms race are facing more and more setbacks due to economic difficulties, extreme scarcity in people's lives, poverty, and all the consequences that follow.

Of course, one thing should be made very clear: what is needed for the prosperity of the people and the country is not the plan to expand the arms race, but the resolute rejection of the plan to expand the arms race.

I will discuss this matter in more detail later.

Wilson admitted that the war plan has already reduced civilian industry. He pointed out that U.S. taxes have increased to an astonishing level, saying that these taxes are still not enough to pay for the arms race. Wilson denied that this means implementing the "guns instead of butter" formula in life, but he admitted that this is like what he said, more guns and less butter, or both guns and artificial butter.

In this case, can it still be said that the war plan and the expansion of war production promote the prosperity of the country? Only if you think that artificial butter is better than butter, and guns are better than artificial butter, can you say such a thing. In other words, only if you are determined to make the guns not only deprive the people of butter but also deprive them of artificial butter, can you say such a thing.

Thus, of course, the conclusion will be drawn, knowing how to answer the question of whether the war plan brings prosperity or, on the contrary, causes poverty, causes the deterioration of the country's economic situation, and all the consequences that follow.

Wilson warned that when factories (here referring to new factories) are built, equipped, and workers are hired, guns will take the first place, and the peaceful economic sector will only get the "surplus materials" from the defense plan.

We know that if the defense plan is the basis of a country's entire economic policy, the surplus materials will be: either nothing at all or a very small amount.

What does Wilson's talk mean in the language of the war plan? (I mention Mr. Wilson because it must be remembered that he is the director of the so-called National Defense Mobilization Agency, which means that although he is responsible to the government and is fully responsible to the government and the country for all his duties, he is still the controller of the entire economic life of the United States within the range of his personal authority.) What does his plan mean in the language of the war plan? The State of the Union Address—just a few days ago we had the opportunity to study that address—explains this. This address indicates three goals: first, to rapidly and on a large scale expand the armed forces and strengthen military aid to U.S. allies; second, to rapidly expand U.S. war industry; third, to increase the production capacity of steel, aluminum, electricity, and other industries that depend on war production.

The U.S. President's speech indicates the three goals contained in Wilson's plan. This speech clearly shows that the entire U.S. economy has already taken the path of war, in other words, the path of preparing for another war.

Therefore, now when we discuss the issue of the measures that must be taken to counter this threat, the threat of another war, it is very timely to talk about all this.

To achieve the three goals mentioned by the U.S. President, how much money does the United States plan to spend? To achieve the goals proposed by the U.S. President, the following measures have already been taken: first, the U.S. Congress has allocated $916 billion—this is a record-breaking amount in peacetime—to implement this plan, of which $772.5 billion is directly used for military purposes.

Of these more than $770 billion, nearly $570 billion is allocated to the Department of Defense as expenses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1952; more than $70 billion is used to implement the so-called "mutual security" plan; more than $40 billion is used to build war bases in the United States and abroad. Of the $70 billion, $1 billion is allocated according to the law of October 10, 1951, for U.S. subversive, espionage, and terrorist activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

This shows how closely related the issue of the general U.S. war plan is to the issue of eliminating the threat of another world war and strengthening international peace and friendship. Because if people allocate $70 billion to implement the so-called "mutual security" plan, and within this amount, there is also $1 billion for subversive activities against some countries, then how can people still talk about friendship? Indeed, in this case, how can one still—like Mr. Lloyd—say that they have extended their hand to us, hoping that we will shake hands with them? Gentlemen of the Atlantic Pact, you have not, as you say, "extended your hand" to us, but rather, it would be more accurate to say that what you have extended to us is not a hand, but a weapon in your hand. Not only that, but at the same time, you have also extended another hand with $1 billion, and you have extended this hand to those desperados whom you are inciting to fight against us, the Soviet people!

We have presented many pieces of evidence regarding the policy of the Anglo-American group, making it clear to people without any doubt that the representatives of this group often talk about their efforts to cooperate with the Soviet Union, their willingness to solve unresolved issues, their "extended hand," and so on, how insincere and hypocritical all this is. All these statements are in sharp contrast to the true policy of this group and the policy of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, which play a major role in this group.

I want to tell Mr. Lloyd that we have heard enough of all these grand speeches and the sweet words of their "heroes." Their speeches are full of contradictions, making them confused, but they still try to deceive public opinion. However, every day we see new facts that expose the aggressive goals of the American plan that is permeated with the delusion of world domination. Those Americans who seek world domination do not heed the tragic lessons of their predecessors—these people also sought world domination—in this regard.

We have repeatedly presented many facts to prove the aggressive nature of U.S. foreign policy, and I do not think it is necessary to cite new facts at present. I only want to talk about the measures with the above goals, pointing out their characteristics, among which very important ones are such measures that the U.S. government, on the one hand, increases its own army, and on the other hand, increases the army of its allies, gathers military groups, and organizes the armies of these groups like the so-called "European Army."

As for the United States, as a result of implementing compulsory military service and mobilizing reserve personnel, its armed forces have greatly increased. Truman's message to Congress in April 1951 acknowledged that in the ten months before that time, the number of U.S. armed forces had more than doubled; and in the next fiscal year, it was planned to further increase to 3.5 million, without counting the 2 million military reserves and National Guard. Thus, the U.S. army currently exceeds 5 million.

From Truman's message to Congress this January, it can be seen that the plan to increase U.S. armed forces to 3.5 million was completed long before the original deadline. This proves that the speed of U.S. military expansion has increased compared to last year's plan. This fact alone can explain many problems.

At the same time, from the figures of the U.S. President's Economic Advisory Committee, it can be seen that U.S. military expenditures were $28.3 billion per year in 1950, increased to $34.8 billion per year in the second quarter of 1951, and increased to $40.7 billion per year in the third quarter. According to the Associated Press, by the end of 1951, U.S. military expenditures had already increased to around $50 billion per year. This includes the costs of the armed forces, military aid to U.S. allies, work related to atomic weapons, and the costs of stockpiling strategic materials. A large amount of money is being used to prepare for the most effective slaughter of millions of peaceful men and women who do not want war, do not pursue world hegemony, do not want to plunder colonies, and only ask: do not interfere with them, let them live their own lives, engage in peaceful labor, and make progress in building their economy and their peaceful, happy, and civilized life. At the same time, these facts show what kind of policy it is to turn the peaceful economy back to war. Everyone knows that the infamous doctrine of "a strong situation" determines the current direction of U.S. foreign policy. Some representatives here praise this doctrine enthusiastically, I can say, with great enthusiasm. However, the experience of applying this doctrine has now shown that this doctrine is completely bankrupt, and the principle of "a strong situation" on which this doctrine is based is also completely bankrupt.

What evidence do we have?

Let me talk about some more facts. In the economic field, the implementation of the Marshall Plan ended in failure and bankruptcy. The Marshall Plan is one of the ways to create or strengthen this "strong situation," and it is precisely in this regard that hopes were placed on the Marshall Plan. I say "ended" because everyone knows: on the night of December 31 last year, the implementation period of the Marshall Plan expired, and since then, another measure has been implemented, which is the establishment of the well-known "Mutual Security Agency."

Everyone knows that the Marshall Plan did not improve the situation of the countries that accepted this plan and took this path; they became truly "Marshallized" countries. The Marshall Plan further worsened and aggravated the economic situation of these countries. The most prominent sign of this at present is the crisis that the governments of France, Belgium, and other countries are facing. In France, this crisis is reflected in the fact that the Pleven government did not receive a vote of confidence. Everyone knows that the collapse of the Pleven government was primarily due to the unstable economic situation in France, which is the direct result of the adverse effects of the Marshall Plan.

I think this issue can be discussed in connection with the development of the international political situation and the infamous principle of "a strong situation." They wanted to use the Marshall Plan to strengthen the "strong situation," but the Marshall Plan failed. Not only did the Marshall Plan fail, but the principle of "a strong situation" and the entire policy based on this principle also failed, and the result must be a complete failure. The Marshall Plan only benefits a small privileged group in the Marshallized countries, and it is of no use to others. It can only cause harm to the people, the economy, and the entire country. No matter which country implements the Marshall Plan, that country will suffer serious harm. However, the Marshall Plan is only one manifestation of the overall policy of U.S. foreign policy that we have discussed above. The situation in foreign policy in 1951 was not better than in the economic field, and there is no prospect of improvement in 1952. In this regard, I must talk about Mr. Acheson's speech at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel New Year's Eve banquet. In this speech, the U.S. Secretary of State described the situation in the so-called "North Atlantic region" as quite optimistic, talking about the progress and increasing prosperity of this region. Various metaphors are now very popular. Last time I talked about Mr. Churchill's metaphor about Britain, comparing Britain to a train traveling downhill at sixty miles per hour. This time, the metaphor used in the speech is Mr. Acheson. This metaphor is also worth noting. When he talked about the situation in the so-called "North Atlantic region," he said: various lives are breaking through the shell surrounding it, emerging from the half-frozen soil... but these lives are in danger of being damaged by late frost. Mr. Acheson said: he thinks the situation in the so-called "North Atlantic region" is also like this.

If we try to explain the meaning of Mr. Acheson's metaphor, based on what he admitted, this proves that in the "North Atlantic region" they have already "half-frozen" or are "freezing up." On the other hand, it also proves that this region is in danger of being damaged by late frost. That is to say, if some tender shoots emerge from the half-frozen soil and are still threatened by severe frost, things are not very good.

It is clear that this metaphor is a cautious warning not to be optimistic about the so-called "North Atlantic region," in other words, not to be optimistic about the truly unsatisfactory state of the Atlantic Pact countries in economic and political terms, about the so-called "prosperity," "good life," and other similar pleasant words that U.S. politicians try to use to cover up.

When talking about the situation in Europe (referring to Western Europe), Mr. Acheson expressed satisfaction with the situation of the so-called "European defense." However, while talking about Europe, he did not hide the fact that Europe is facing serious economic and financial problems, which seem to be emerging—using Mr. Acheson's own words—"shadows... for our European friends and ourselves, these problems are difficulties and dangers."

What do we learn from these words? This means that in Europe, things are also not very good, because here there are economic problems like the "shadows" that appear before Europe. If economic and financial problems are like shadows standing before Europe, this means things are not good at all. We already know from Mr. Churchill's speech that Britain's financial situation is on the verge of bankruptcy. This is what Mr. Churchill said.

In the view of U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, what is the main task of the United States in Europe? His answer to this question is four words: arm Europe. This means: produce as many weapons as possible, gather as large an armed force as possible, create this infamous "strong situation," stockpile more military equipment—this is what the United States and the entire world need to achieve "prosperity" and "a good life." At the same time, it must be determined: the situation of the United States and other countries within the sphere of U.S. influence is worsening; at the same time, they also have to admit: "we are freezing up," "half-frozen," "shadows," "a train traveling towards the abyss," and so on.

For this reason, the United States pays so much attention to the Schuman Plan (the so-called European Coal and Steel Community Plan) and the Pleven Plan (the plan to organize the European Army and incorporate the regular German army). However, in the end, all these "shadows" and "serious economic and financial problems" are actually connected with the Schuman Plan, the Pleven Plan, the rearmament of West Germany, and all such problems. Not only that, these serious economic and financial difficulties are actually the direct result of all these plans.

In talking about the Near East and the Middle East, Acheson found two countries that he said were the "bright and happy lands" of "this region"—Greece and Turkey. However, apart from Turkey and Greece, there are many other countries in this region that Acheson did not pay attention to. This region is a vast region, and this region has long been attracting the attention of American and British monopolies. This region, according to Acheson's admission, is very important to the United States because of its manpower, resources, strategic position, and transportation routes. Everyone knows that it is precisely because of this situation that the idea arose: to use the Middle East Command, which the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey are now trying to force the Near East and Middle East countries to accept, and the military measures that the above four countries are forcing them to accept and execute, to subjugate the Near East and Middle East countries under American and British power, and to turn these countries into military bases and bridgeheads for executing aggressive plans.

Acheson only paid attention to Greece and Turkey, thus making the situation of Greece and Turkey a bit difficult. Of course, this is very pleasant for the Greek and Turkish representatives present, Acheson praised them, or rather, patted them on the shoulder with special favor. In the other countries of the Middle East and the Near East, Acheson did not see anything bright for the United States. However, what does it mean to say that the situation of the other countries in the Near East and the Middle East is not "bright"? What is bothering Acheson and the U.S. government? It is the failure of the U.S. so-called Middle East Command plan. I only limit myself to talking about the above, because we have already discussed this "plan" in detail here. I only want to recall one thing: Acheson, when talking about the future of this region, said that in 1952, the development of the situation in the Near East and the Middle East would require the United States to take measures to "provide more leadership" and also require the United States to be more willing to "assume increasingly heavy responsibilities" in this region.

When the United States talks about its responsibility to this or that region of the world, what does it mean? We know that since the entire policy of the United States is based on the principle of "a strong situation," the meaning of the United States' words is nothing more than: the United States uses the pretext of assuming so-called "responsibility" to cover up its efforts, it strives to put this region under its control, and finally, to occupy this region with its own and allied armed forces. If it were not so, how could one assume so-called "responsibility" with bare hands? The United States' talk about "responsibility" and the like is the prelude to military occupation! For the Near East and the Middle East regions, Acheson's words mean nothing more than: since the United States has assumed responsibility for these two regions—incidentally, I don't know who imposed this responsibility on the United States—it plans to take measures to enable itself to assume this so-called "responsibility."

We all know that the U.S. responsibility for the Far East region has led to the military events in Korea. We know that the U.S. aggressive forces, under the pretext of such "responsibility," on the one hand, cover up their aggressive policy against the People's Republic of China, and on the other hand, protect the bankrupt Kuomintang bandits who were driven out of mainland China by the Chinese people.

In this speech, Acheson explained the future trend of U.S. foreign policy by mentioning three regions of the world, with the Far East being the third. Acheson, when talking about the war imposed by U.S. interventionists on the Korean people, said: "In the past year, the changes in Korea have been enormous." Korean cities and villages have been savagely destroyed, and people have been slaughtered in large numbers. In the combat zones and far from the front lines in northern Korea, the Korean population has almost been completely annihilated—this is the "enormous change," and the year in which all these things happened is described as "the changes in Korea have been enormous." This is an unprecedented manipulation of language, can one imagine anything more absurd than this?

At the same time, Acheson also used the Korean incident to illustrate the effectiveness of "collective security." He also said that the work of the U.S. representative at Panmunjom has been excellent. However, the whole world knows that in fact, they are delaying the armistice negotiations as much as possible, constantly putting forward various unreasonable and completely groundless demands, making the negotiations more and more complicated. They put forward such demands only because they do not want the current issues of the Korean Armistice Negotiating Committee to be resolved satisfactorily, do not want the negotiations to end smoothly, and do not want to stop the war.

Therefore, Mr. Acheson had to admit in his New Year's speech: "We still do not know whether the Korean War can be stopped, or when it can be stopped." This is not surprising. However, this matter depends entirely on the U.S. government.

The above words are enough to make one realize: if the United States continues on this old path—the path of plotting and executing its aggressive plans for the private interests of a handful of American monopolists—the world—Europe, the Middle East, the Near East, the Far East, and the United States itself—will face what kind of fate this year.

However, the aggressive forces of these countries plan to continue to implement their current foreign policy line. They ignore the increasingly strong warnings from all aspects within the United States and the Atlantic Pact countries and plan to continue to adhere to this line. Many political leaders, social leaders, and representatives of the business community in the United States, Britain, and France have issued such warnings, exposing the gambling and warmongering nature of the aggressive forces of the above countries, their policies have brought new dangers, threatening international peace and cooperation.

The situation indeed confirms that these warnings and the anxiety about the development of events harmful to peace are not groundless.

The current international situation is like this.

The war preparations and base-building of the U.S. aggression group are completely incompatible with the purposes of the United Nations.

All the above seems to be enough to dispel any doubts. It is necessary to take urgent measures to change this situation, to eliminate the threat of another war, and to ensure international peace and security. This is our responsibility, the responsibility of all peace-loving peoples, all those who do not just talk about peace but actually stand up against the threat of another world war, all those who strive for the consolidation of international peace and friendship.

Title: The Soviet Union's Consistent Stand on Peace and Its Opposition to the Aggressive Policies of the United States and Other Countries

The Soviet Union has consistently and steadfastly striven to establish and strengthen friendly relations with all peace-loving countries since its founding. From the day it was established, it has relentlessly fought for peace and against war. Therefore, the Soviet Union cannot ignore the conspiracies and machinations of the aggressive forces represented by the United States, Britain, France, and certain other countries in forming the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) – the United States using the financial, economic, and political dependence of other NATO member countries to achieve its goals – driving this organization to pursue warlike objectives.

Previously, in previous sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and in this session, we have already pointed out the aggressive nature of NATO. The objectives pursued by this organization are completely different from the purposes of the United Nations, and the principles on which it is based are also completely different from the principles of the United Nations. The tasks it sets for itself are obviously contrary to the tasks of the United Nations.

As early as January 1949, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in its statement on the North Atlantic Treaty, pointed out some features of this plan that left no doubt that the formation and activities of this organization were aimed at executing the plans of the United States and Britain to dominate the world. Since then, many events have occurred that have fully confirmed the correctness of this statement. These events have convincingly proven that the North Atlantic Treaty and NATO were concluded and formed in the interests of a small group of countries led by the United States and Britain to use various means to make the policies of the governments of other countries, which are subordinate to them or directly dependent on them, conform to the achievement of their aggressive ambitions.

It was already clear at the time, and subsequent events have fully confirmed this: the Western European Union, the Pan-American bloc, and the Mediterranean Pact, the Scandinavian Pact, the Southeast Asia Pact, and other similar pacts that were then being drafted, are closely related to the objectives of NATO. NATO is striving to implement the plans of the United States and Britain to establish hegemony in Western Europe, in the North Atlantic region, in South America, in the Mediterranean, in Asia, in Africa, as pointed out in the statement of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in any place within the reach of the American monopolists.

Current events repeatedly confirm this. These events show what the ambitions of NATO, primarily the United States, Britain, and France, are towards the countries of the Far East, the Middle East, and the Near East.

The principles and purposes of the United Nations do not need any explanation from us; the Charter signed in San Francisco in June 1945 has clearly expressed them. However, if we compare the purposes and tasks of the United Nations, as expressed in the United Nations Charter, with the activities of NATO, primarily with its plans, its secret plans, and even its openly declared plans, it is enough to convince us that: participation in the aggressive NATO bloc and participation in the United Nations are completely incompatible. It is quite obvious that the status of a member of the United Nations and the behavior of certain countries – primarily the United States – in establishing military bases on foreign soil are also incompatible.

The foreign policy of the NATO countries – primarily the United States – is linked to the frenzied expansion of armaments and the stockpiling of atomic bombs, this inhuman weapon of mass destruction. This foreign policy is completely contradictory to the purposes of the United Nations, which are to maintain international peace and security, to develop friendly relations between nations, and to implement economic cooperation to solve international economic, social, cultural, and humanitarian problems. This should be completely beyond dispute.

The American aggressors, in order to plunder the tungsten mines of Korea, have repeatedly and unreasonably obstructed the cessation of hostilities. As long as this war imposed on the Korean people continues, there can be no measures to eliminate the threat of another world war; this should be completely beyond dispute. It is obvious that the earliest cessation of hostilities in Korea is one of the main conditions for eliminating this danger and is also one of the main conditions for consolidating international peace and security.

It is laughable and shameless to talk about efforts to strengthen international friendship and peace while not taking any practical actions and not being willing to help bring the armistice talks in Panmunjom to a swift and successful conclusion. We propose to help solve this important issue; the United States and the entire NATO bloc do not want to do this, but they talk about peace and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue! Incidentally, they are now chattering endlessly about this issue, especially emphasizing its military aspects, saying that the problem must be solved by war! They pretend not to know such a simple thing, that to eliminate the danger of another war, one must stop the policy of conquest that the United States is pursuing in Korea, which has become a battlefield.

The objectives pursued by the American aggressors in this war are completely different from the plans they announced to unify, revive, and establish an independent Korean state.

We remember: as early as 1947, a special mission led by General Wedemeyer, the former commander of the U.S. forces in China, visited Korea and made recommendations to President Truman. The essence of this recommendation was to turn Korea into a buffer state. This general then firmly advocated the use of occupation to permanently neutralize Korea militarily.

Wedemeyer said: From a strategic point of view, the United States is very eager to ensure that Korea is permanently neutralized militarily.

As early as 1947, Wedemeyer's imperialist rhetoric about Korea was repeated a few days ago by the famous American political columnist Lippmann. Lippmann wrote in the New York Herald Tribune on January 3 of this year: The United States does not only want a narrow strip of land between the two armies on the battlefield in Korea, but it wants to turn the entire Korean Peninsula into a buffer zone between the great powers.

Who instigated Lippmann to write this article? He advocates turning the entire Korean Peninsula into a buffer zone under American command and points out that the former commander of the U.S. forces in China, General Wedemeyer, had proposed this principle as the principle for the United States to "handle" the Korean issue. This bellicose columnist, representing whose views, is speaking in this way? These are very interesting questions. The mouthpiece of the American aggression bloc – Lippmann – writing this article is not accidental. This is obviously intended to prepare American public opinion to exert new pressure on the opposing side in the Panmunjom talks and to fan the flames of American reactionary chauvinism and militarism.

Of course, people can only regard the writing of such an article as an attempt to sabotage the Korean talks through the press, to propagate the continuation of the Korean war, and to incite American generals to be stubborn and die-hard. It is precisely these things that truly obstruct all efforts to bring the talks to a successful conclusion to stop hostilities in Korea!

When mentioning the Korean issue, some representatives, mainly American and British representatives, said here that the Panmunjom armistice talks have made some progress, although they also admitted that the progress is slow. In fact, these talks have made no progress at all. Since the talks began at the initiative of the Soviet Union, more than six months have passed. The representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Command have made several important proposals. If these proposals are adopted, they will certainly ensure a ceasefire and the establishment of peace in Korea. These proposals stipulate: the commands of the belligerent parties should issue a ceasefire order to stop any air, land, or naval forces from conducting bombing, blockade, and reconnaissance activities against the other side. This is the first step to stop the bloodshed and destruction in Korea. They proposed: to declare the areas where both sides withdraw as demilitarized zones, where neither side can station armed forces or conduct hostile activities; finally, they proposed: to ensure the end of the Korean War and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea within the shortest possible time.

This proposal was met with fierce opposition from the U.S. Command. We all still remember that the first proposal to hold the Kaesong talks was made in the Soviet statement: "The first step is for the belligerent parties to negotiate a ceasefire and a truce, and for both parties to withdraw their troops from the 38th parallel." However, the U.S. representative at the beginning of the talks opposed the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line for achieving the armistice, which obviously deviated from the basis of the talks at the beginning. The U.S. Command proposed to draw the demarcation line far north of the 38th parallel – some areas even north of the front line held by the Korean People's Army – they wanted to use this method to seize a large piece of land (covering more than 12,000 square kilometers) from northern Korea.

The U.S. Command has intensified savage bombing of North Korean territory, cities, and villages that are not military targets, and has launched a series of provocations against the neutral zone of Kaesong. The neutral zone of Kaesong has been repeatedly subjected to air strafing and invasions by armed forces of the South Korean military under the command of the U.S. Command.

The proposal for an immediate ceasefire has always been rejected by the U.S. Command. Even American newspapers have pointed out that the United States wants to seize that part of North Korea, which has abundant tungsten reserves, and American monopolists are rushing to exploit these mines. The failure to reach an agreement on the Korean armistice is to a large extent due to this.

I do not know the true facts, but according to the news in American newspapers, a company (everyone knows that Dulles is a major shareholder of this company) is particularly active in the area that the United States is particularly insisting on occupying.

To a large extent, it is precisely this situation – the plundering of tungsten mines – that makes it impossible to reach an agreement on the Korean armistice. This is not surprising, because on the one hand, tungsten mines make it impossible to reach an agreement on the Korean armistice, while on the other hand, oil makes the situation in Iran more tense.

Everyone knows that in the Panmunjom talks, several important issues have not been resolved. Regarding the exchange of prisoners of war, the talks have reached a stalemate because the U.S. Command has proposed completely unreasonable demands contrary to the basic principles of international law, to exchange prisoners of war on a one-to-one basis; while the Korean-Chinese side, based on the principles of international law, has justly proposed to exchange prisoners of war on the basis of all-for-all.

Regarding the issue of the Korean-Chinese side building airport facilities, no agreement has been reached. The U.S. Command also wants to force the Korean-Chinese side to accept unfair conditions in this regard. Everyone knows that the U.S. Command insists: except for a limited number of airports on North Korean territory that are completely civilian, the Korean-Chinese side should not build airports and airport facilities on its territory. The U.S. Command demands that the airports destroyed by American bombing should not be repaired. However, the U.S. Command continues to bomb Korean territory. How can one then prohibit the repair of these airports that are being destroyed by the Americans and are needed in the fight against these bombings?

On the one hand, the proposal to stop hostilities is being rejected; on the other hand, people are saying: "You dare not, you certainly cannot repair what we are destroying (here we are talking about the issue of airports)."

This is completely absurd, this is completely unreasonable.

Regarding the holding of a meeting of responsible representatives of both sides to solve the problem of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the unification of Korea, no agreement has been reached.

The Soviet representative, representing the world's peace-loving peoples, insists on taking steps to promote the earliest cessation of hostilities in Korea.

It is not surprising that we have also encountered opposition here from the representatives of the United States, Britain, and certain other countries, who oppose the committee discussing the issue of Korean unification. Everyone knows that the issue of Korean independence has been withdrawn, with the excuse that it is indefinitely postponed for discussion – this is the explanation given by Mr. El-Ghori, who can be said to have unexpectedly helped these delegations. Since the most humane proposal here – to help and promote the cessation of hostilities – has encountered sharp opposition, then it is not surprising that in Korea, no agreement can be reached on the basic, I should say, humane issues.

This once again proves that the withdrawal of the Korean independence issue and the failure of this committee to discuss this issue is so unjust, and also proves that our insistence that if we truly want peace, we must certainly not shirk our most sacred and important duty – to take all measures to assist in the cessation of hostilities in Korea – is how correct. Extinguishing the flames of Korea is a condition for preventing the emergence of new war hotbeds in other places.

But you, gentlemen of the Atlantic bloc, refuse to do this. You are so afraid of this proposal that you try to delete the proposal that the General Assembly should instruct the Security Council to first study the issue of promoting the success of the Korean armistice in the special session held today.

On the one hand, you swear that you hope for peace and hate war, and on the other hand, you so lightly, I should say, so carelessly, throw aside the truly humane proposal – the proposal that the Security Council should assist the two sides in Korea to reach an agreement on the cessation of hostilities through the talks now being held there – you rely on what logic, I still do not understand.

I must take this opportunity to say: We will still keep the issue of Korea in our proposal, and we believe that our duty is to once again make it clear to people that: it is not only necessary to listen to the voice of the Soviet Union, not only to listen to the voice of the delegation representing our great country and great people, but also to listen to the voice of the 596 million people who signed in support of the recent declaration of the World Peace Council – this declaration calls for the realization of our proposal, which we are defending here with such perseverance, such strength, believing in the justice of our cause – it is also truly necessary.

Indeed, the main task at present is to extinguish the flames in Korea.

People say to us: "This is your propaganda, this is your empty talk, show us your actions."

Therefore, we will show you our actions. We demand that you join us on the true path that can end the war. But you refuse to do this.

You deceive the world by saying to us: "You say a word, and the Koreans will end the war." But you yourselves know that this is absolutely untrue. We can more reasonably say to you: "Let Ridgeway say a word, and as soon as he gives an order to his subordinates, the war will end."

Therefore, we propose that when discussing the sixth item on the agenda today – measures to eliminate the threat of another world war and to strengthen international peace and friendship – we discuss this issue again!

Someone might tell us: "We just rejected the proposal to discuss this issue the day before yesterday, why are you forcing us to discuss this issue again?"

Yes, we are forcing you to discuss this issue, and the reason is very simple, you should know. We are doing this because we want peace, we are doing this to prevent another world war from breaking out, and finally, we are doing this because we know: those who seek peace must try to extinguish every war flame – no matter where it occurs in the world – instead of igniting and fanning these flames.

Since this issue is the second item in the proposal submitted to the committee for discussion, we indeed insist that the committee should discuss this issue again.

If our criticism of your intentions and wishes (we believe your wishes are warlike and aggressive) is wrong, then please prove it with actions – I will not withdraw my words for fear of losing face. Prove with actions that you do not want the Korean War to continue, prove that you are truly extending your hand to us, as you say, a sincere, peaceful, friendly hand, not a hand of aggression and war. We know: when people extend their hands holding weapons, they will certainly not throw away their weapons.

Gentlemen, do you not understand that if the Korean War issue is not resolved quickly, then talking about your "collective measures" plan and your plan to reduce armaments and balance armaments is useless? It is useless because these plans will only be filed as a resolution in your archives, not only the resolution, but also the committee you established under the name of the "Ad Hoc Committee" is also useless. You call it a "mini-United Nations," to act as a kind of rescue team for the ineffective Security Council. But what is the use of this Ad Hoc Committee? It has done nothing for two years. We have not heard about its situation. Even no one remembers it. Such a "mini-United Nations"! It is a dead United Nations! It is not a mini-United Nations, but almost a dead full-sized United Nations. That is the situation with your Ad Hoc Committee! However, you have passed a resolution on this issue. You were very enthusiastic at the time. You even invited us to participate in this committee, you even reserved a seat for us in this committee, as you said at the time, hoping that we would understand the importance of this committee and participate in it in the future. For example, as Mr. Cohen said today at the General Assembly, he said: We (he said so) hope that the Soviet Union will finally understand the benefits of so-called "collective measures" and accept these measures! This is a futile hope! We did not participate in the past and will not participate in the Ad Hoc Committee in the future, because it is dead, it emits the smell of death, it emits the smell of a corpse. Your committee is dying. Let it die. No one needs it.

But a resolution has been passed on this issue, and you have placed your hopes on this resolution.

Allow me to express our deep conviction – I am not trying to teach you, we do not dare to think so, I am only expressing our deep conviction. We believe that the resolutions passed by you at this session on so-called armament reduction and so-called "collective measures" are infants that were stillborn; while our proposal is a living cause. This cause – to strive to promote the earliest cessation of hostilities in Korea – is a living cause. If we do not want to become merely a tool and weapon of the aggressive policies of some bloc, we have the responsibility to assist this cause.

If the Korean issue cannot be resolved, it will be difficult to expect the easing of international tensions. Therefore, resolving the Korean issue is an urgent matter, and promoting the successful conclusion of the Korean armistice talks is the main and most important responsibility of the United Nations.

The United States has established military bases in many countries, threatening the security of these countries and creating tensions.

We have talked about how the armament race and the actions of the NATO countries, primarily the United States, in expanding and establishing naval and air bases have affected the international situation.

Now, no one is unaware that the United States has naval and air bases in Western Europe and Southern Europe, in North Africa and Asia Minor, and is building new bases. These bases are distributed in nineteen countries: Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, West Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, Britain, France, Spain, Italy, French Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Malta, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, and Egypt.

In addition, it should be noted that the United States also has bases in the Far East and Asia, especially in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and other places.

According to the 155th law of September 28, 1951, the U.S. government allocated 2.167 billion dollars for the construction of military bases abroad. According to the Associated Press on November 1, 1951, most of this money is to be used for the construction of new military bases and the expansion of existing bases around the world, with about 1 billion dollars to be used for "the construction of some secret airfields near the Soviet Union."

Part of the funds for the construction of military bases on foreign soil also comes from the so-called military, technical, and economic "aid" funds, which total 7.329 billion dollars.

According to the explanation of the chief of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, O'Hara: If the construction of a certain base is intended for the use of the U.S. armed forces supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops, then the construction of this base is included in the base construction plan. In the new terminology of the NATO leaders, the meaning of "base construction" is the base system constructed jointly by all member countries of this bloc in Western Europe.

Thus, the United States, under the guise of "aid" to other countries, is actually constructing and expanding its own bases. This was openly stated by Major General Ohmstead, the head of the Military Assistance Division of the U.S. Department of Defense, at a subcommittee meeting held on September 27 last year. At that time, he pointed out that the United States would contribute its share to the "base construction" through military and economic aid to other countries.

The United States has planned to spend about 500 million dollars in Europe in 1952 to build military bases, including bases in Turkey, France, and French Morocco.

In addition, the United States plans to use the occupation expenses to have the occupied countries pay for the construction of bases. Congressman Skelly on October 10 last year, in his speech to Congress on the base issue, said: Japan has already paid part of the construction and use of these facilities, which is part of the occupation expenses (see the Congressional Record of October 10, 1951).

In 1951, the construction of bases under the so-called Western European Union plan alone consumed about 100 million dollars. Here, special mention should be made of the tasks assigned to this plan for the British Isles. According to newspaper reports, according to an agreement between Britain and the United States, Britain will gradually become a huge aircraft carrier for the takeoff and landing of jet bombers flying in the stratosphere. Once war breaks out, these planes can deliver atomic bombs to the heart of the Soviet Union. In the Associated Press report, the word "deliver" is only used to cover up a shameless confession, intending to make people not see that they plan to drop these bombs on the designated places.

Now, about 20,000 American air force personnel are stationed in Britain, managing the current bomber and fighter base. Four new bases are under construction, and the British and American sides are also negotiating to transfer some British air bases to American management.

Everyone knows that the British Prime Minister recently said: The most significant measure taken by the Labor Government with the support of the Conservative Party is the establishment of a huge and constantly expanding air base in eastern England to launch atomic attacks on the Soviet Union. Churchill's claim that the Soviet Union has aggressive intentions is only to cover up the true purpose of establishing such bases. Japan's war equipment is being built on a large scale, under the supervision of American soldiers by the Japanese government and Japanese construction companies. The port of Sasebo has become a powerful naval base – the center for the concentration and supply of American troops in Korea. Most of the American ships and foreign ships operating in the waters of Korea now use Sasebo as their base. The U.S. Navy also fully utilizes the Japanese naval base of Yokosuka. Kobe is also used for military purposes, and the United States especially uses the warehouses in Kobe to store military supplies for transport to Korea. The ports of Japan's woodcutting, Nanao, Maizuru, and others are being extensively built with military facilities. American military officers and army engineers are in charge of supervising all the work.

According to newspaper reports, the so-called administrative agreement includes a special part for general rights, including the secret provisions of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" signed in San Francisco in early September last year. In these general rights, there is not even a shadow of the limited independence and sovereignty that Japan has enjoyed so far. On the other hand, these rights provide broad opportunities and sufficient guarantees for the American military authorities to establish military bases in Japan at will, to use Japanese ships and general transportation facilities.

We cannot overlook these facts, because all this is happening in the neighboring countries of the Soviet Union and our friends in the Far East. This situation cannot but cause us concern. It is not us who are establishing these bases, but the United States and Japan together are establishing these bases, thus turning Japan into a bridgehead of the United States, or using the words of the British Prime Minister when talking about Britain, turning it into an "aircraft carrier" of the United States.

This is incompatible with the proposal to reduce armaments. However, that proposal did not mention bases. We now propose to talk about war bases and firmly propose the issue of truly reducing armaments and armed forces and abolishing war bases on foreign soil – not doing so would certainly not strengthen peace and eliminate the threat of war.

The United States, whenever it has the opportunity, uses some countries – even the smallest countries – to prepare for war and to attack other countries. Even the Dominican Republic has become a good partner of the United States. The United States and this republic signed a special agreement, stipulating that part of the test range of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Florida can be set up on the territory of this republic to test guided missiles.

The position of Denmark is the same. In the far north of the Arctic Circle, near the city of Thule in northwestern Greenland, the United States has built an air base. According to the Washington Post, this air base will become another powerful tool to prevent communist aggression against Europe. This statement should be understood as: the base in Greenland will become a springboard for atomic attacks on the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

The Washington Post revealed this in its issue of October 16, 1951, it openly said: The air base has been secretly established in northwestern Greenland to launch atomic attacks on any important targets in Russia.

It seems that there is nothing more shameless than this!

These facts all genuinely prove that the NATO countries led by the United States are frantically preparing for war. These facts show that the scale of war preparations is constantly expanding, making international relations more tense, and they do not care how this will affect the well-being of the peoples of those countries that have been dragged into and are being dragged into the scope of this aggressive policy.

The responsibility, of course, should be borne by those who are frantically expanding armaments, establishing new bases, openly expanding existing naval and air bases, and shamelessly proclaiming their purpose – to prepare to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries – thus creating this tense situation.

The Soviet Union proposes to reduce the armaments of the five major powers by one-third and advocates holding regular world disarmament conferences.

The Soviet Union uses its peaceful policy to counter this aggressive policy.

On the one hand, from the time the resolution on this issue was adopted, the five major powers should reduce their armaments and armed forces by one-third within one year; on the other hand, all countries should provide full and formal information about the military bases they have on foreign soil, information about their armaments and armed forces, including information about atomic weapons. These are two important measures, the implementation of which will undoubtedly ease international tensions and help eliminate the threat of another world war and strengthen international peace and friendship.

As for the issue of reducing the armaments and armed forces of the five permanent members of the Security Council by one-third, objections to this proposal have already been raised, and these objections are nothing more than determining that these measures will be of no help in easing international tensions because even if these measures are taken, the balance of power between the armed forces of the countries will remain the same. In addition, they also argue that such a reduction will put the Soviet Union in a favorable position because this will allow the Soviet Union's military superiority over other countries to continue to exist.

We have already pointed out that such objections cannot withstand any refutation because the claim that the Soviet Union has military superiority is itself groundless. Moreover, it can be determined, as we have pointed out, that the armed forces possessed by the United States and the other NATO countries are more than those of the Soviet Union. The armed forces of the United States, Britain, and France now exceed several times those before the war in 1939 and are more than twice those of the Soviet Union.

Everyone knows that the Soviet government has demobilized personnel of the 33rd class at the appropriate time, and this fact itself is sufficient evidence for those who are somewhat familiar with the issue of mobilization, proving that the reduction of armed forces compared to wartime has been achieved in the Soviet Union.

At the same time, everyone knows that, as confirmed by President Truman of the United States in his message to Congress on January 9, 1952, the armed forces of the United States increased by more than one million in 1951.

They rejected our proposal to reduce the armed forces and armaments of the five permanent members of the Security Council by one-third, and did not want to consider the following facts: in stark contrast to the expansion of armaments and the continuous expansion of armed forces, such a reduction will undoubtedly have a great moral and political impact on the nature of international relations, strengthening trust and eliminating mistrust and suspicion.

As for the so-called military inequality and the need to establish so-called "equilibrium of armed forces" to eliminate the dangers arising from such inequality, historical facts are sufficient evidence to prove that such reasoning is not valid. In addition, it should be pointed out that from the speeches of all the authorities of the NATO countries, it is clear that the armed forces of the United States, Britain, France, and their allies are already very large, and if they say that they must raise the level of their armed forces and armaments so that they can discuss the issue of reducing armed forces and armaments on an equal footing with other countries, this is unreasonable.

The U.S. President said in his message to Congress in January that collective defense has been achieved in Europe, and he said that the "free countries" have created a real fighting force, which has become a real obstacle to any attempt by hostile forces to sweep across Europe to the Atlantic. The U.S. President emphasized this point because he wanted to explain why the United States dared to propose the issue of reducing armaments at this session of the United Nations General Assembly, along with Britain and France, although we all know that this proposal does not truly stipulate the reduction of armaments. Truman said that the U.S. proposal is a concrete and feasible proposal for reducing armaments.

Therefore, if the proposal put forward by the three Western countries led by the United States is indeed a proposal for the genuine reduction of armaments, or as Truman said, a concrete and feasible proposal for reducing armaments, then the issue of "balance of power" would no longer be important. In this way, the opposition to the adoption of the Soviet proposal would be unreasonable, and the Soviet proposal advocates the reduction of armed forces and armaments by one-third, and advocates the convening of a world conference on the reduction of armaments by the member states of the United Nations and non-member states on the date stipulated in the proposal to achieve the purpose indicated in the proposal.

Since this is the case, then what is the issue? If a force has been created that prevents anyone from extending their hostile intentions to the entire Europe to the Atlantic, that is, the time for the genuine reduction of armaments and armed forces has arrived.

But they advocate that we only conduct investigations, and they also call such investigations armament reduction.

Now we propose: to convene a world conference on the reduction of armaments within the shortest possible time, no later than July 15, 1952, and to cancel the proposal to convene such a conference before June 1, 1952.

The Soviet Union advocates the conclusion of a five-power peace treaty as an important guarantee to eliminate the threat of war.

We have proposed in the past and still propose now to conclude a five-power peace treaty as an important guarantee to eliminate the threat of another war and to consolidate peace. At the same time, as I have just said, we propose to convene a world conference on the reduction of armaments within the shortest possible time. People say to us that the dates we propose are not realistic. We are willing to change this date. Previously, we proposed that such a conference should not be held later than June 1, 1952, and now we change it to no later than July 15, 1952. We believe that this will give us sufficient time to carry out the necessary preparations for such an important conference. Thus, we will have part of January and the whole of February, March, April, May, June, and the first half of July, a total of six months to prepare.

We still firmly advocate the conclusion of a five-power peace treaty – the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union – as an important guarantee to eliminate the threat of another war. So far, the objections raised against the five-power peace treaty cannot be considered serious. For example, some people say that such a peace treaty is unnecessary because the United Nations Charter itself is an all-encompassing treaty. However, in addition to the United Nations Charter, there are other agreements aimed at eliminating the threat of another war and aimed at resisting any threat of aggression. For example, there are agreements between the Soviet Union and Britain, the Soviet Union and France. Moreover, after the establishment of the United Nations, many other multilateral treaties and agreements have been concluded. Therefore, in the arguments against the conclusion of a peace treaty, there is no argument and there cannot be any argument worthy of any attention.

The Soviet Union proposes to implement the ban on atomic weapons at the same time as the international supervision system comes into effect.

Of particular importance is the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and establishing international supervision. This issue has already been discussed in the First Committee; however, I still think it is necessary to talk about this issue again.

On this issue, the Soviet Union is based on the fact that the United Nations General Assembly must immediately announce the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and establish strict international supervision to make this ban effective. We believe that the United Nations General Assembly must simultaneously instruct the Disarmament Commission to draft a convention to take various measures to ensure that the decision of the United Nations General Assembly to prohibit atomic weapons, stop the production of atomic weapons, use existing atomic bombs only for peaceful purposes, establish strict international supervision, and make the above-mentioned convention effective, and submit this draft convention to the Security Council for consideration.

This proposal has been met with opposition from the three Western countries, which insist that the ban cannot be implemented before the supervision system comes into effect, and the ban remains a mere formality. They continue to stubbornly defend their proposal, which advocates first establishing an international supervision system and then announcing the prohibition of atomic weapons. In order to promote an agreement on this issue, we propose that at the time of announcing the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and establishing strict international supervision, it should be simultaneously declared that the ban on atomic weapons and international supervision should come into effect at the same time.

This should dispel all the arguments that the Soviet proposal to prohibit atomic weapons and establish international supervision is "impractical" – as the Westerners say.

Our proposal undoubtedly opens the way to reach an agreement on such an important issue as the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of effective and strict international supervision to make this ban effective.

We firmly advocate that the United Nations General Assembly immediately announce the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and establish strict international supervision. However, we agree that the ban on atomic weapons should be implemented at the same time as the international supervision system comes into effect.

As for the date for drafting the convention, we now cancel the proposal to set it as February 1 (in November last year, this date was acceptable), and propose to set it as June 1, 1952.

As for the nature of international supervision, we have also made very important proposals in this regard. We propose that such supervision should be "long-term." We now agree to put forward our proposal in the following form:

"In order to establish an appropriate system to ensure that the decisions of the General Assembly on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the reduction of armaments are implemented, the international control organization has the right to conduct long-term inspections, but it has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries."

We advocate the proposal to establish strict international supervision, which has also been met with opposition from the three Western countries. They reject this proposal, saying that this proposal is merely a declaration, saying that if no agreement is reached in advance, if the supervision system does not begin to be implemented, it has little significance. As for supervision, the three countries insist that this supervision should not be limited to individual inspections or inspection activities, and they particularly emphasize the word "long-term inspection."

Based on the above reasons, we have made some necessary amendments to our original proposal "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and to Strengthen International Peace and Friendship," and we believe that the adoption of our proposal is a very important step in solving the current problems.

　　论消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施
    ——维辛斯基一月十二日在联合国大会政治委员会上的演说
    第一委员会现在讨论到苏联代表团提出的议案：“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施”。
    这个问题的措辞就说明了它的极度重要性，在目前国际关系紧张的情况下，这个问题的重要性尤其明显。
    这里必须提醒一下，在本届会议刚开始的时候，苏联代表团就在这个问题上提出了自己的建议；而在大会全体会议上，我们的代表团的发言和其他某些代表团，特别是那些和苏联合作的代表团的发言，很大一部分都是谈到这个建议的。苏联代表团在去年十一月八日和十一月十六日都曾就这个问题发言，同时还就这个问题再提出了一些新的建议。
    从那个时候到现在，两个月已经过去了。在这一段时间里，第一委员会考虑了大会议程上的某几项议案，其中或多或少地涉及和我们目前讨论这个议程时要谈到的事项有关的问题。
    这是非常自然的，因为严格地说来，第一委员会所讨论的一切问题都是在某种程度上和这个根本的问题关联着的，这个根本的问题就是消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好。要解决这个问题，就需要制订一些措施，以保证上述任务的履行。在讨论第一委员会已经讨论过的议案时，当然不能不分析目前的国际局势，不能不确定这方面之所以存在着令人不满意的状态的原因，不能规避或拒绝努力想出一些办法，以便按照联合国的宗旨和任务来改善这种情况。
    可是，以前所审议的那些问题，和现在我们必须予以研究并且在讨论议程第六项——就是今天的议程——时必须有所决定的问题有关的那些问题，在我们看来，尽管是很重要的，可是仍然不过是当前这个问题的个别的因素罢了。既然如此，应该加以研究的就不是任何个别的措施——尽管这种措施可能是极其重要的——而是全部的措施或问题。这些措施或问题，不仅必须分别加以审议，而且必须合起来，紧密地合起来，加以审议。这些措施或问题之间的这种联系，首先是由分别地逐项讨论这些问题或概括地全盘讨论这些问题时所产生的一些目标和任务决定下来的。
    “关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施”这个议案的意义，正是这样的。
    美国扩军的步调越来越疯狂促使物价上涨人民生活恶化
    苏联代表团在本届大会一开始的时候就已经指出：目前联合国面临着许多重要的任务，可是需要我们立刻有所决定的最重要、最迫切的任务，就是消除那些妨害加强国际和平和合作的障碍，消除另一次世界大战的威胁。就在那个时候，我们已经指出：在前一个时期，也就是自从联合国第五届大会结束以来，无论在经济或政治上来说，国际情势都更加复杂了。这一点已经由许多无法驳倒的事实证明了，尽管某些国家的政府和这些国家在联合国的代表，特别是那些对这个时期国际情势更加严重一事应负责的人们，设法否认这些事实，假装不知道这些事实，可是这是没有用的。
    必须说：使国际局势日益恶化、使国际关系愈益紧张的基本、主要和最重要的原因，是以美国为首的大西洋集团和其他一些国家的侵略政策，这些国家在美国的压力下不得不采取同样的政策，虽然它们同时又希望从这个政策中、从执行这个政策中为自己谋得经济上和政治上的利益。
    奉行这种政策或在这种政策范围之内的国家碰到了愈来愈大的困难，这种困难首先影响到广大阶层人民。我们已经指出过，目前这种情势必然要产生这种后果。大家都知道，赋税和军事预算的重担主要是压在这些国家的人民肩上的，而赋税和军事预算的沉重负担，又是从事扩张军备、扩充军队、建立新的军事基地和扩大已有的军事基地、加紧生产和积累原子武器等等的政策的结果。
    我们已经谈过这些问题，并且列举了许多事实说明世界经济，尤其是英、法、意、西德和其他许多国家的经济日益衰落的情形。
    近来，这些国家的经济情势已恶化到这样厉害，因此，在讨论今天这个议案时必须提一提和这个问题有关的事实。美利坚合众国在这一方面也不是例外。例如，刚刚发表的“国防”动员署署长威尔生向美国总统杜鲁门提出的第四季度报告，就是令人信服的证明。从这个报告中可以明显地看出：美利坚合众国军事生产现在每月将值二十亿美元左右，这是一九五零年水平的三倍。这些产品中有：重型和中型轰炸机、轻型和中型坦克、各种类型的炮、射击指挥设备、雷达设备、各种类型的定向飞弹、火箭、现代化的军舰，自然也有原子能产品。可是，威尔生的报告指出：这仅仅是个开端。因此，应该预料到军事支出一定要进一步增加。在这方面必须提到：去年（一九五一年）十一月底，也就是说只在两个月以前，就是这个威尔生提出保证说，美利坚合众国的军事生产在一九五三年会达到最高水平，那时每月军事生产的价值就要接近四十亿美元。
    这样，我们现在不仅看见为执行战争计划、生产军火、扩充武装部队、在世界许多地方构筑陆海空军各种战争基地已经大大增加了费用，而且美国还计划在将来甚至还要大大增加这方面的费用。我要在这里说：这种情况影响所有各国的切身利益。这种情况也影响苏联的利益，因为，大家知道，美国首脑人物们已公开承认：制造这些武器，首先是为了反对苏联。一切爱好和平的国家当然关切到这一国或那一国的军事生产是否扩大。
    从威尔生的报告看来，可以断定：美国的扩军运动不仅在继续进行，而且还在不断地加强，扩军的步调是越来越疯狂了。从威尔生的报告看来，美国政府显然还要把执行战争计划所用的费用大大增加。这种情况，和苏联就消除另一次战争威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施所提出的问题，是直接关联着的。
    美国为了准备新战争，为了在所谓“北大西洋地区防务”的欺人之谈的掩饰之下准备新战争而采取军事措施。现在，情况怎样呢？在这些措施中，他们最注意的是加强空军和生产原子武器，什么原子大炮呀、战术原子武器呀等等。美国的飞机制造工业现在几乎完全在生产军用物品。美国这种飞机制造工业在去年一年中扩大了百分之六十七。这里所根据的是美国官方材料，大家知道，这种材料一向是缩小了的。到一九五一年第四季，到一九五一年十月、十一月、十二月三个月，也就是最近，美国五金制造工业已经有百分之三十五在生产军用物品了。一九五二年第一季打算为军事生产使用的钢，要比一九五○年第二季多百分之六百，而且，许多事实表明：这方面使用的钢到一九五二年年底还要进一步增加。铝和铜的军用消耗情况也是一样。
    从威尔生的报告里可以明显地看出：今年，由于战争计划的后果，美国人民会感到民用物品比去年更加缺乏，因为一九五二年第一季消费品制造方面所分配到的原料已经比一九五一年最后一季减少了许多。
    这一切都是军事生产膨胀的结果。在美国，军事生产消耗了对国民经济极度重要的大量的铜、铝及其他物资，这些物资从前是用来进行民用生产的，现在却用来实行战争计划，用来满足战争需求。
    应该指出，这种情况为从事军事生产的美国垄断资本造成了谋取利润的绝好机会。他们获得了惊人的利润。从下面的事实中，我们可以在这方面得到一个概念：美国垄断资本的利润在一九五一年是每年四百六十二亿美元，和战前一九三九年的利润比较，增加七倍多。而在同一个时期，生活费用上涨了，赋税增加了，社会福利计划减缩了，货物的质地变坏了：这一切都在物质上沉重地打击了普通人民，把人民原来已经很低的生活水准压得更低了。
    至于在追随美国政策的国家里生活费用上涨的情形，我们从法国的例子里可见一斑。每一个人都可以看到，惊人疯狂的扩张军备运动对法国造成了多么严重的经济恶果：战争措施吞没了非常大量的金钱和物资，因而促使生活费用上涨，而且是不断上涨，促使人民生活水准每况愈下。
    随便那一个主妇都能比我更好地告诉你这方面的情形，因为她天天到市场去，在那里亲自看到许多事实，十分简单的事实，我要说这些事实是每一个人都能了解的。造成这些现象的直接原因是高级当局的政策，这些政策强烈地影响了占人口绝大多数的下层人民。
    根据美国劳工部最新的材料，十一月份的生活费用比战前高百分之八十八点六，比一九五○年六月美国对朝鲜进行武装干涉之前高百分之十点八。
    在十一月底，美国食物的零售价格比战前高百分之一百三十四点五，比一九五○年六月高百分之十五。谈到这里，也许应该提一下，在这个时期里，苏联的物价在有计划地减低，尤其是消费品的价格减低得最多。所以会减低物价，所以能减低物价，正是苏联经济制度优于资本主义各国经济制度的必然结果。
    在美国的许多工业区里，由于消费品生产的减缩和血汗制度的推广——这种制度在美国也正如在别的资本主义国家一样，极为流行——已经普遍发生失业现象。《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志在十二月七日说：“在许多工业中，工人都被遣散了，纺织工业、服装工业、汽车工业的情形尤其是这样。在十五个地区里，失业现象到了危急的程度。在其他九十三个地区里，劳动力过剩。”劳动力过剩也就是失业，也就是说劳动力的供应超过了工业、农业和运输业所能吸收的程度。
    根据美国的材料，美国的失业人数在汽车工业部门就有十四万人以上。这个数字是根据美国官方的统计材料的，大家都知道，这是经美国统计机关低估了的。
    《纽约时报》在一九五一年十二月二十三日说：“黯淡的新年”在等待着底特律十二万失业者。现在“黯淡的新年”到来了！然而，这“新的一年”的前景对底特律和美国其他工业中心来说，并不比过去的一年更加光明愉快。克莱斯勒工厂联合汽车工人工会机关刊《堡垒》十一月号指出：在新的一年的上半年里，底特律的失业人数可能会达到二十万人。
    最新的官方数字表明：在十月份，美国全失业者的人数是一百六十一万六千。这是指完全没有工作做的人。如果把“半”失业者也算进去，也就是说把那些有一点点收入的人（即使每星期只有几个钟头的工作）也计算在内，那么，失业者的数字就有七百万至一千二百万人，或者甚至更多。根据美国的官方数字，完全失业、每星期只有一小时至二十九小时工作以及登记为有职业而实际并无工作的这三类人共有一千二百万。
    这就是美国目前的失业情况。农民的境况也不见得比较好。下面的事实明显地证明了这一点：一九五一年农民的总收入等于一百五十亿美元，比一九四六年到一九四九年每年的收入低得多了，那时的收入在一百九十五亿美元以上，而且，谁都知道，当时美元的购买力要比现在高得多。
    美国战争计划使民用工业缩减美国政府预言的“繁荣”是说谎
    大家知道，美国统治集团对一九五○年抱着很大的期望，特别是在经济动员上抱很大的希望，但是现在没有一件事情不是和预料相反的。美国政府所预言的“繁荣”结果证明毫无其事。而实际上是美国人民的境况愈益恶化。现在，正当新的一年开始之时，美国政府官员又再次提出种种诺言和保证，说要改善大西洋集团各国的经济情况，还说扩张军事生产就能带来经济繁荣——这正是我现在打算在问题这一方面谈到的结论。他们大叫大嚷地保证说：增加军火生产就能改善经济情况。他们公开提出“从扩张军备中求得繁荣”这样的口号来进行宣传。
    这些荒谬的原则决定了他们的全盘政策，不仅说明了以美国为首的大西洋集团各国经济方面的政策，而且也说明了它们总的政策；不仅说明了它们总的政策，而且也说明了它们的外交政策——这是目前我们最关心的。
    军事生产的增加真正妨碍了国家和人民的繁荣。目前军事生产增加的程度可以从这样的事实看出来：例如为了充分满足战争工业对镍的需要，一九五二年民用工业几乎完全不得消耗镍；又例如在二月以后，工作母机一概不得运给不是从事所谓“防务”生产的厂家。
    他们使整个经济生活服从于以“有实力的局势”原则为依据的政策，这就破坏了民用经济的基础，使国家根本没有了经济繁荣的可能——只要不把国家繁荣和靠战争定货来谋求“有实力的局势”之光荣的那些垄断资本的繁荣混为一谈。
    威尔生在他的报告中不得不提出警告（我是引用这个报告中有关的那一部分）说：“防务费用的继续增加仍是将来通货膨胀的主要原因。”他说这句话并不是偶然的。同时，威尔生还要求再增加税收。
    现在，仅仅是这些事实就可以证明：扩军运动绝不能促进繁荣，而且，相反地，那些实行扩张军备的国家由于经济困难，由于人民生活中的极端匮乏，由于贫穷等等以及由于随之而来的一切后果，正在碰到越来越多的挫折。
    当然，有一点应该是十分明白的：人民的繁荣、国家的繁荣所需要的，不是扩张军备的计划，而是断然拒绝扩张军备的计划。
    对这件事，我以后还要再详细谈一谈。
    威尔生承认战争计划已经使民用工业缩减。他指出美国的税收已增加到惊人的程度，他说，可是这些税收仍然不够付扩张军备的账。威尔生否认这意味着在生活中实行“大炮代替牛油”的公式，但是他承认这就是像他所说的多来大炮少来牛油，或者是大炮和人造牛油兼顾。
    在这种情况下，还能够说战争计划、扩大战争生产促进了国家的繁荣吗？只有在你们认为人造牛油比牛油好，而大炮又比人造牛油好的情况下，才会这样说。换句话说，只有在你们一心一意要使大炮不但剥夺了人民的牛油，而且也剥夺了他们的人造牛油时，才能够说出这样的话来。
    这样，当然就会得出结论，晓得应该怎样回答战争计划究竟是带来繁荣呢，还是相反地，引起贫穷、引起国家经济局势的恶化以及随之而来的一切后果的这个问题了。
    威尔生警告说：当工厂（这里指的是新工厂）建筑起来，装备好了，并且雇到劳工时，大炮要占第一位，而和平经济部门只能得到国防计划中的“剩余物资”。
    我们知道，如果防务计划是某一个国家的整个经济政策的基础时，剩余物资会是什么：不是什么都没有，就是很少很少的一点点。
    美国不顾其先行者的悲惨教训仍然抱着称霸世界的狂妄计划
    如果用战争计划的语言来说，威尔生先生的谈话是什么意思呢？（我提到威尔生先生，是因为，必须记住，他是所谓国防动员署的署长，其实也就是说，即使他是向政府负责，向政府和国家担负他分内工作的全部责任，可是在个人的权限可能达到的范围内，他仍然是美国全部经济生活的支配者。）如果换成战争计划的语言来说，他的计划是什么意思呢？杜鲁门的国情咨文——就是几天以前我们有机会研究过的那篇咨文——说明了这一点。这篇咨文表明了三种目标：第一、大规模而且极迅速地扩充武装部队，加强对美国各盟友的军事援助；第二、尽可能迅速地扩充美国的战争工业；第三、提高战争生产所依赖的钢、铝、电力和其他工业的生产力。
    美国总统的这篇谈话表明了威尔生计划中所包含的三个目标。这篇谈话清楚说明：美国整个经济已经走上了战争的轨道，换句话说，走上了准备另一次战争的轨道。
    因此，现在当我们讨论关于为了抵制这种威胁，抵制另一次战争的威胁而必须采取的种种措施的问题的时候，谈到这一切，是十分适合时宜的。
    为了达到美国总统所提到的三个目标，美国打算花多少钱呢？为了达到美国总统所提出来的这些目标，已经实行了下面这一些措施：第一、美国国会拨款九百一十六亿美元——这是打破和平时期的纪录的数额——来实行这种计划，其中有七百七十二亿五千万美元是专门直接用在军事上的。
    在这七百七十多亿美元中，将近五百七十亿是拨给国防部，作为截至一九五二年六月三十日为止的这个财政年度的费用的；七十多亿是用来执行所谓“共同安全”计划的；四十多亿是用来在美国国内和国外建筑战争基地的。在那七十亿美元中，包括根据一九五一年十月十日法拨出来供美国对苏联和人民民主国家进行阴谋破坏、间谍活动和恐怖活动用的一亿美元。
    这就表明了在关于美国一般战争计划的问题与关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的问题之间，存在着怎样密切的关系。因为，如果人们为了执行所谓“共同安全计划”而拨款七十亿美元，而且其中还包含着为对一些国家进行阴谋破坏活动而用的一亿美元在内，那么，人们还谈得上什么友好呢？的确，在这种情况下，人们怎样还能够——像劳埃德先生那样——说已经向我们伸出手来，希望我们和他们握手呢？大西洋集团的诸位先生们，你们并没有像你们所说的那样，向我们“伸出手”来，倒不如更正确地说，你们向我们所伸出的，并不是手，而是拿在手中的武器。不但如此，你们另外一只手同时还拿着一亿美元，而且把这只手向着那些你们正在纠合、正在唆使他们对我们苏联人民作战的亡命之徒伸了出来！
    我们已经就美英集团的这种政策提出了许多证据，使人们毫无怀疑地看到，这个集团的许多代表们常常说什么他们努力谋求和苏联合作呀，什么他们愿意解决悬而未决的问题呀，什么“伸出手来”呀诸如此类的话，是怎样毫无诚意，怎样虚伪。这种种说法和这个集团的真正政策，和在这个集团中起着主要作用的美、英、法三国政府的政策，恰成尖锐的对照。
    我愿意告诉劳埃德先生，我们已经听够了这一切宏论，听够了他们那些“英雄”的甜言蜜语。他们的发言矛盾百出，使得他们自己也惶惑起来，可是他们还要努力欺骗舆论。然而，每一天我们都看到新的事实，这些事实揭露了贯串着称霸世界的狂想的那个美国计划的侵略目标。妄图称霸世界的那些美国人不顾他们的先行者——这些人也是想称霸世界的——在这方面的悲惨教训，不肯抛弃他们这种想法。
    我们以前已经一再提出许多事实，证明了美国外交政策的侵略本质，我觉得目前没有必要引证新的事实。我在这里只想谈一谈具有上述目标的那些措施，指出其特点，其中很重要的就是这样一些措施，美国政府一方面为了增加自己的军队，另一方面为了增加其盟国的军队、拼凑军事集团、组织这些集团的军队像所谓“欧洲军”等而采取的措施。
    至于美国，由于实行强制兵役和动员后备役人员的结果，它的武装部队已大为增加了。杜鲁门一九五一年四月致国会的咨文承认，在那时以前的十个月当中，美国武装部队的人数增加了一倍多；而在下一财政年度中还打算继续增加到三百五十万人，各种军事后备队和国民警卫队的二百万人还没有计算在内。这样说来，美国军队目前已经超过五百万人了。
    从杜鲁门今年一月致国会的咨文中可以看出：美国武装部队增加到三百五十万人的计划，早在原定日期之前很久就完成了。这就证明了美国扩展军队的速度比去年的计划增加了。单单这一件事就可以说明许多问题。
    同时，从美国总统经济顾问委员会的数字中可以看出：美国的军事开支在一九五○年是每年二百八十三亿美元，一九五一年第二季增加到每年三百四十八亿美元，第三季增加到每年四百零七亿美元。据美联社消息，到一九五一年年底，美国的军事开支已经增加到每年五百亿美元左右。这里面包括武装部队的费用、对美国的盟国的军事援助、和原子武器有关的工作的费用以及囤积战略原料的费用。大量的金钱正在用来进行准备工作，以便对千百万和平男女进行最有效的屠杀，这些人不要战争，不追逐世界霸权，不想掠夺殖民地，他们所要求的只是：不要干扰他们，让他们能够过自己的生活，从事和平劳动，在建设他们的经济和他们的和平、幸福、文明的生活方面能够有所进展。同时，这些事实表明了那种使和平经济再转向战争的政策究竟是怎么一回事。大家都知道，臭名远扬的“有实力的局势”的学说决定了目前美国外交政策的方针。有些代表在这里极口赞扬这个学说，我什么可以说，充满着热情来赞扬。可是，应用这个学说的经验现在已经表明这个学说完全破产了，这个学说所根据的“有实力的局势”的原则已经完全破产了。
    “马歇尔化”国家经济局势的恶化是美国武装欧洲政策的直接后果
    我们有什么证据呢？
    让我再谈一些事实罢。在经济方面，实行马歇尔计划结果使得事情以破产和失败而告终。马歇尔计划是创立或增强这种“有实力的局势”的方式之一，也正是在这方面对马歇尔计划寄予希望的。我说“告终”是因为大家都知道：去年十二月三十一日晚，马歇尔计划执行期满，从那时起，另一个措施实行了，这就是成立大家都知道的“共同安全署”。
    大家都知道，马歇尔计划并没有改善那些接受这个计划并且走这条道路的国家的情况，它们变成了真正“马歇尔化”的国家。马歇尔计划使这些国家的经济局势进一步恶化和更加严重了。目前关于这件事的最显著的一个标志，就是法国、比利时和其他国家的政府现在所遭遇的危机。在法国，这个危机表现在普利文政府得不到信任票上。大家都知道，普利文政府垮台首先就是由于法国经济局势动荡不定，这是马歇尔计划的不良影响的直接后果。
    我认为可以和国外政治局势的发展、和臭名远扬的“有实力的局势”的原则联系起来谈这个问题。他们想用马歇尔计划来增强“有实力的局势”，可是马歇尔计划却失败了。不仅马歇尔计划失败了，就是“有实力的局势”的原则和基于这个原则的全盘政策也遭到失败，而且结局必然是全盘失败。马歇尔计划只对马歇尔化国家的少数特权集团有利，对其他的人是没有好处的。它只能造成对人民、对经济和整个国家的损害。无论那一个国家实行马歇尔计划，这个国家就会严重地遭受这种损害。可是，马歇尔计划只是我们在上面所谈到的美国外交政策的总方针的一种表现。一九五一年外交政策方面的情形并不比经济方面好，也看不到一九五二年会有较好的前景。在这方面，我必须谈一谈艾奇逊先生在华道夫·亚斯多里亚饭店除夕宴会上所发表的演说。美国国务卿在这篇演说里把所谓“北大西洋地区”的局势说成是颇为乐观的，他谈到了这个地区的进步和经济的越来越繁荣。各种各样的比喻现在都很风行。上次我谈过邱吉尔先生关于英国的比喻，他把英国比作以六十英里速度从山上往下行驶的火车。这次在演说中使用比喻的是艾奇逊先生。这个比喻同样是值得注意的。当他谈到所谓“北大西洋地区”的局势时，他说：各种生命正突破包围着它的外壳，从半冻的土壤里冒出来……可是这些生命都有遭到晚霜摧残的危险。艾奇逊先生说：他认为在所谓“北大西洋地区”的情形也是这样。
    如果我们设法说明艾奇逊先生这个比喻的意义，根据他所承认的，这就证明了在“北大西洋地区”他们已经“半冻了”或者“正在冻结起来”。另一方面，又证明这个地区有遭受晚霜摧残的危险。这就是说，如果有些嫩芽从半冻的土壤里冒出来而仍然受着严霜的威胁，事情就不是很妙的。
    很明白，这种比喻是慎重的警告，要别人对美国政客们试图用来掩盖所谓“北大西洋地区”，换句话说，就是掩盖大西洋集团各国在经济和政治局势方面真正不能令人满意的状态的那些“繁荣呀”、“美好的生活呀”以及其他类似的好听的话不要乐观。
    谈到欧洲（指的是欧洲西部）的局势时，艾奇逊先生对所谓欧洲“防务”的状况表示满意。但是，在谈到欧洲的同时，他并不掩盖这样一件事实：欧洲面临着的严重的经济和财政问题好像是隐约出现的——用艾奇逊先生自己的话说——“暗影……对我们欧洲的朋友和我们自己来说，这些问题就是困难和危险。”
    我们从这些话了解到一些什么呢？这就是说，在欧洲，事情也同样不大妙，因为这里有着那种和隐约出现的“暗影”一般的经济问题。如果经济和财政问题像矗立在欧洲面前的暗影，这就是说事情一点也不妙。我们已经从邱吉尔先生的演说里知道了英国的财政情况已濒于破产。这是邱吉尔先生说过的。
    在美国国务卿艾奇逊看来，美国在欧洲的主要任务是什么呢？他对这个问题的答复是四个字：武装欧洲。这又意味着：生产尽量多的武器，集结尽量庞大的武装部队，创立这个臭名远扬的“有实力的局势”，囤积更多的军备——这就是美国和整个世界达到“繁荣”和“美好的生活”所需要的。但同时又必须确定：美国和美国势力范围之内的其他国家的局势正在越来越恶化；同时，他们也不得不承认：“我们在冻结了”、“半冻结了”、“暗影”、“向深渊行驶的火车”等等。
    为了这个缘故，美国才对舒曼计划（所谓欧洲煤钢联营计划）和普利文计划（组织欧洲军并收揽德国正规军参加的计划）这样注意。可是，归根结底，其实这一切“暗影”和“严重的经济和财政问题”根本就是和舒曼计划、普利文计划，和西德的重新武装以及所有这一类的问题连在一起的。不但如此，这些严重的经济和财政困难，其实就是上述这一切计划的直接后果。
   美国对世界各地的侵略行动危害和平威胁国际和平合作
    艾奇逊在谈到近东和中东的时候，找到了两个国家是他所说的“这个地区的光明乐土”——就是希腊和土耳其。可是，除了土耳其和希腊以外，这个地区还有其他许多国家，这些国家是艾奇逊先生所没有注意到的。这个地区是一个广大的地区，这个地区所有的国家长久以来就一直在吸引着美英垄断企业的注意了。这个地区，据艾奇逊先生承认，由于它的人力、资源、战略地位和交通孔道，对于美国是非常重要的。大家知道，正因为有这种情况，才产生了这样的念头：利用美、英、法、土四国现在想强迫近东和中东国家接受的中东司令部，利用上述四国不顾近东和中东国家抗议而强迫它们接受并要求它们执行的军事措施，使近东和中东国家屈服在美英势力之下，并且把这些国家变成执行侵略计划的军事基地和桥头堡。
    艾奇逊先生仅仅注意到希腊和土耳其，因此使希腊和土耳其的处境有几分为难。当然，这对于在座的希腊代表和土耳其代表说来是很惬意的，艾奇逊先生夸奖过他们，或者说，特别垂青地拍过他们的肩膀。在中东和近东的其他国家，艾奇逊看不出什么对美国说来是光明的东西。可是，说近东和中东的其他国家的情况不“光明”，这是什么意思呢？使艾奇逊和美国政府烦恼的，是什么事情呢？那就是美国的所谓中东司令部计划的失败。我只限于谈谈上面的事，因为关于这个“计划”我们在这里已经谈得很详细了。我只要追述一件事：艾奇逊在谈到这个地区的前途时说，在一九五二年，近东和中东形势的发展会要求美国采取措施，“予以更多的领导”，也需要美国更加乐意“在这个地区担负越来越重的责任”。
    当美国谈到它对世界这个地区或那个地区的责任时，它的意思是什么，我们是知道的。既然美国的全部政策是以“有实力的局势”为根据的，那么，美国这话的意思就不外是：美国以担负所谓“责任”的话来掩饰它这种努力，它竭力要把这个地区置在自己控制之下，最后还要用自己的和盟国的武装部队来占领这个地区。如果不是这样，一个人怎么能够赤手空拳地担负所谓“责任”呢？美国那些什么“责任”之类的话就是军事占领的先声！对于近东和中东地区说来，艾奇逊这一番话无非表示：美国既然对这两个地区负有责任——附带提一句，不知道是谁把这种责任加在美国身上的——就打算采取措施，好让自己有能力来担负这种所谓“责任”。
    我们都知道，美国对远东地区的这种“责任”造成了朝鲜的军事事件。我们知道，美国的侵略力量想借口这样的“责任”，一方面掩盖他们对中华人民共和国的侵略政策，另一方面则庇护已经被中国人民赶出中国大陆的破了产的蒋介石匪帮。
    艾奇逊在这次发言中说明美国外交政策今后的趋势时提到了世界三个地区，远东是其中的第三个。艾奇逊谈到美国干涉者强加于朝鲜人民身上的这种战争时说：“一年来，朝鲜境内的变化是巨大的。”朝鲜的城市和乡村被野蛮地摧毁，人民被大批地屠杀，在交战地区以及远离战线的北朝鲜的后方，朝鲜居民几乎被全部消灭——原来这就是“巨大的变化”，而发生这一切事情的一年被形容为“朝鲜境内的变化是巨大的”的一年。这真是闻所未闻的玩弄辞句的手段，难道可能想像到比这种话更荒谬的吗？
    艾奇逊同时还引用朝鲜的事件来说明“集体安全”的效力。他还说，美国代表在板门店的工作做得很出色。但是，全世界都知道，事实上他们是在尽可能拖延停战谈判，不断提出种种无理的、完全没有根据的横蛮要求，使谈判愈来愈复杂。他们所以要提出这样的要求，只能认为因为他们不愿意使朝鲜停战小组委员会当前的问题得到完满解决，不愿意使谈判顺利结束，不愿意停止战争。
    因此，艾奇逊先生在他的新年谈话中不得不承认：“我们还不知道朝鲜战争是不是能够停止，也不知道什么时候才能够停止。”这是不足为奇的。但是，这件事情完完全全取决于美国政府。
    我上面这些话已经足以使人认识到：如果美国继续走这条老路——为了一小撮美国垄断资本家的私利而策划和执行其侵略计划的道路，全世界——欧洲、中东、近东、远东和美国本土——今年就要碰到怎样的命运。
    然而，这些国家的侵略力量打算继续执行他们目前的外交政策方针。他们不顾美国和大西洋集团各国内部各方面愈来愈坚强的警告，打算继续坚持这个方针。美国、英国和法国渐渐有很多政治领袖、社会领袖和实业界代表发出这样的警告，揭露上述各国侵略力量的赌博性和好战性，它们的政策带来了新的危险，威胁着国际和平与合作。
    局势果然证实了这种警告以及对危害和平的事件继续发展而感到的焦虑不是无的放矢的。
    目前的国际局势就是这样。
    美国侵略集团备战和建立基地是和联合国宗旨完全不相容的
    上述一切似乎已经足以使人不再怀疑。必须采取紧急措施来改变这种情况，来消除另一次战争的威胁，来保证国际和平和安全。这就是我们的责任，是一切爱好和平的人民的责任，一切不是空谈和平而是实际上起来反对另一次世界大战的威胁的人，一切为巩固国际和平与友好而奋斗的人，都有这样的责任。
    苏联一贯始终如一地为和一切爱好和平的国家建立并巩固友好的关系而奋斗，从它立国的一天起，就不断为争取和平和反对战争而奋斗。因此，对于美、英、法三国和其他某些国家的侵略集团成立大西洋集团——美国利用大西洋集团其他成员国在财政、经济和政治上对它的依赖而达到它的目的——驱使这个集团去追逐好战的目标，对于这些侵略力量的这一类阴谋诡计，苏联是不能置之不理的。
    以前，在前几届大会以及本届大会上，我们都已经指出了大西洋集团的侵略性，这个集团所追求的目的和联合国的宗旨毫无相同之处，它所依据的原则同样和联合国的原则毫无相同之处，它为自己规定的任务显然也是和联合国的任务相违背的。
    远在一九四九年一月，苏联外交部就北大西洋公约发表声明时就指出了这个计划的一些特点，这些特点使人毫不怀疑这个集团的成立和它的活动方案是为了执行美英妄图称霸世界的计划的。自从那时以后，许多事件发生了，这些事件完全证实了这种说法是正确的。这些事件非常有说服力地证明：北大西洋公约和大西洋集团是为了以美英为首的一小撮国家的利益而缔结和组成的，以便用种种方法使服从它们或者直接依赖它们的其他国家的政府的政策适合于达到它们的侵略野心。
    当时就已经十分明显，以后的事件又完全证实了这一点：西欧联盟、泛美集团以及当时已经在拟订的地中海公约、斯堪的纳维亚公约、东南亚公约及其他相似的公约，是和达到大西洋集团的目的密切相关的，大西洋集团竭力要实现美英在西欧、在北大西洋地区、在南美、在地中海、在亚洲、在非洲，正如上述苏联外交部的声明所指出的，在美国独占资本家魔掌所及的任何地方建立霸权的计划。
    目前的事件一再证实了这一点。这些事件说明了大西洋集团，首先是美、英、法三国，首先对远东、中东和近东各国的野心是什么。
    联合国的原则和宗旨用不着我们作什么解释，一九四五年六月在旧金山签字的宪章已经明明白白地表示出来了。但是，只要把联合国宪章所表示的联合国的宗旨和任务，与大西洋集团的活动，首先是与它的计划，它的秘密计划和甚至已经公开的计划比较一下，那就足以使我们相信：参加大西洋侵略集团和参加联合国是完全不能相容的。十分明显，联合国会员国这种身份，和某些国家——首先是美利坚合众国——在外国领土上建立陆海空军基地的行为，同样是不能相容的。
    大西洋集团各国——首先是美国——的外交政策，是和疯狂地扩张军备，和储存原子弹这样一种侵略武器，储存大规模毁灭人类的不人道的这种武器连在一起的。这种外交政策和联合国的宗旨，维持国际和平与安全，发展国际间的友好关系，实行经济合作以解决国际上经济、社会、文化和人道的问题等宗旨，是完全矛盾的。这应当是完全不容置辩的事。
    美国侵略者为了掠夺朝鲜的钨矿竟一再无理取闹阻挠停战谈判
    只要强加于朝鲜人民身上的这种战争在朝鲜继续一天，就不可能有任何能够消除另一次世界大战的威胁的措施；这应当是完全不容置辩的。显而易见，尽早停止朝鲜境内的敌对行动是消除这种危险的主要条件之一，同时也是巩固国际和平和安全的主要条件之一。
    侈谈自己努力加强国际友好与和平，而并没有采取实际行动，并且不愿意设法促使板门店停战谈判尽早圆满结束，这是可笑的无耻的行为。我们建议帮助解决这个重要问题；美国和整个大西洋集团不肯这样做，却大谈和平与和平解决朝鲜问题！顺便说一句，他们现在竟然喋喋不休地谈论这个问题，特别强调这个问题的军事方面，说必须用战争解决问题！他们假装不知道这样一件简单的事情，就是要想消除另一次战争的危险，就必须停止执行美国对已沦为战场的朝鲜所执行的征服政策。
    美国侵略者在这场战争中所追求的目标，是和他们宣布的使朝鲜统一、复兴、并且建立独立的朝鲜国家的计划毫无相同之点的。
    我们记得：早在一九四七年，前驻华美军司令魏德迈将军所率领的特别代表团就访问过朝鲜，并且向杜鲁门总统提出建议，这个建议的实质是把朝鲜变成缓冲国。这个将军那时已经坚决主张用占领朝鲜的办法来使朝鲜在军事上永远中立化了。
    魏德迈说：从战略观点看，美国非常希望保证朝鲜在军事上永远中立化。
    早在一九四七年魏德迈就提出的美国对朝鲜的帝国主义论调，在前几天又被美国著名的政论专栏作家李普曼重弹了一遍。李普曼在今年一月三日，只是几天以前，在《纽约先驱论坛报》上写道：美国所望于朝鲜的不仅是在战场上两军之间划出狭窄的地区，而且是把整个朝鲜半岛当作大国之间的缓冲地带。
    是哪些人策动李普曼写这篇文章的呢？他主张把整个朝鲜半岛变为美国指挥下的一个缓冲区，并且指出前驻华美军司令魏德迈将军曾经建议把这个主张当作美国“处理”朝鲜问题的原则，这个好战的专栏作家所以这样讲，又是代表谁的意见呢？这些倒是很有趣的问题。美国侵略集团的喉舌——李普曼——写这篇文章并不是偶然的。这显然是打算使美国舆论准备向板门店谈判的对方施用新压力，打算煽起美国反动派沙文主义和军国主义的凶焰。
    当然，人们只能认为写这种文章是为了要通过新闻界来破坏朝鲜谈判，宣传要继续进行朝鲜战争，怂恿美国将军顽固和死硬到底。正是这些东西真正阻碍了促使停止朝鲜敌对行动的谈判顺利结束的一切努力！
    提到朝鲜问题时，有些代表们，主要是美国和英国的代表们在这里硬说板门店停战谈判是有些进展的，虽然他们也承认进展缓慢。事实上，这种谈判根本没有任何进展。自从在苏联的倡议下开始谈判以来，已经过了六个多月。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部的代表曾提出若干重要建议，如果这些建议被采纳，那就一定能够保证停火，保证能在朝鲜建立和平。这些建议规定：交战双方的司令部应颁发停火令，使任何一方的陆、海、空军停止向对方进行轰炸、封锁和侦察活动，这是停止在朝鲜的流血和破坏行动的第一个步骤。他们建议：宣布双方撤出的地区是非军事区，任何一方在那里都不得驻扎武装部队或进行敌对行动；最后又建议：为了保证结束朝鲜战争与和平解决朝鲜问题，所有外国军队都应在尽短期间内撤出朝鲜。
    这个建议竟受到美国司令部的拚死反对。我们大家都还记得，首先提议举行开城谈判的苏联声明说：“第一个步骤是交战双方应该谈判停火与休战，而双方把军队撤离三八线”。但是，美方代表在开始谈判时却反对以三八线作为达成停战的军事分界线，这显然离开了谈判开始的基础。美国司令部建议在三八线以北很远的地方——有些地区甚至在朝鲜人民军所据守的前线以北——划定分界线，他们想靠这种办法从朝鲜北部攫取大片土地（面积有一万二千多方公里）。
    美国司令部对北朝鲜领土、城市和没有军事目标的乡村加紧进行野蛮的轰炸，并且对开城中立区发动一连串的挑衅，这样来行使压力。开城中立区不断地遭到空中扫射和美国司令部所统辖的南朝鲜军武装队伍的侵犯。
    立即停火的建议总是遭到美国司令部的拒绝。连美国报纸也指出，美国想要取得的北朝鲜那一部分领土，其钨矿储藏量很丰富，美国垄断资本家正在加紧开采这种矿。朝鲜停战协议之所以不能达成，在很大程度上正是因为这一点。
    我不知道事实真相到底是怎样，但是美国报纸上的消息说，有一个公司（谁都知道，杜勒斯是这个公司的一个大股东）在美国特别坚持要占据的那个地区特别活跃。
    在很大程度上，正是后一种情形——掠夺钨矿——使得朝鲜停战不能达成协议。这并不是出人意料之外的，因为，一方面钨矿使得朝鲜停战不能达成协议，而另一方面，石油使得伊朗局势更加紧张。
    大家知道，在板门店谈判中，若干重要问题仍然没有解决。关于交换战俘的问题，谈判已经成了僵局，因为美国司令部提出了违反国际法基本原则的完全不合理的要求，要根据一对一的原则来交换战俘；而朝中方面则根据国际法原则公正地提出建议，主张按全部交换的原则来交换战俘。
    关于朝中方面修建机场设备的问题也没有达成协议。美国司令部在这方面也打算强迫朝中方面接受不公平的条件。大家都知道，美国司令部坚持：除了北朝鲜领土上完全作为民用的数目有限的飞机场以外，朝中方面不得在其领土上修建机场和机场设备。美国司令部要求不得修复因美国飞机的轰炸而被破坏的飞机场。但是，美国司令部对朝鲜领土的轰炸却继续在进行。这样，又怎能够禁止修复这些正被美国人破坏而在对付这些轰炸的斗争中又需要的飞机场呢？
    一方面，停止敌对行动的建议正在遭到拒绝；另一方面，人们又在说：“你们不敢，你们一定不能修复我们正在破坏的（这里谈的是飞机场的问题）。
    这根本是荒谬的要求，这完全是无理取闹。
    关于举行双方负责代表的会议来解决一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题和朝鲜统一的问题这一方面，也还没有达成协议。
    苏联代表世界爱好和平的人民坚持要设法尽快促成朝鲜停战
    毫不为怪，我们在这里也遭到了美、英和其他某些国家的代表的反对，他们反对由委员会来审议关于朝鲜统一的问题。大家知道，关于朝鲜独立的问题已经被撤销了，借口是什么无限期延期讨论这个问题——这是埃尔—古里先生给这种事情找到的说法，埃尔—古里先生可以说是出乎意料地给这些代表团帮了忙。既然在这里最合乎人道的建议——帮助并促进敌对行动停止——遭受了尖锐的反对，那么，在朝鲜，不能在基本的，我要说是人道的问题上达成协议，又有什么令人惊异的呢？
    这又一次证明了撤销朝鲜独立问题，不由这个委员会讨论这个问题，是多么不公正，也证明了我们坚持如果我们真正要谋求和平就当然不能逃避我们这个机构的最神圣、最重要的义务——采取一切措施协助停止在朝鲜的敌对行动——是如何正确。扑灭朝鲜的火焰，就是防止在其他地方出现新战争温床的危险。
    可是你们这些大西洋集团的大人先生们拒绝这样做。你们是那样地害怕这种建议，以至于设法从今天在大会上表决过的苏联提案中删除要求大会责成安全理事会在举行特别会议的时候首先研究促使朝鲜停战成功的问题的建议。
    你们一方面发誓说什么希望和平，说什么憎恨战争，另一方面又这样轻率地，我要说，这样不在意地把真正合乎人道的建议——建议安全理事会协助在朝鲜的双方通过现在正在那里进行的谈判尽早求得停止敌对行动的协议——扔到一边去，你们所依据的到底是什么逻辑，我现在还是不明白。
    我必须趁这个机会说：我们仍然要把关于朝鲜的问题留在我们的提案中，而且认为我们的义务就是再一次向人们表明：不仅倾听苏联的声音，不仅倾听代表着我们伟大的国家和伟大的人民的我国代表团的声音是真正必要的，而且，倾听签名拥护世界和平理事会最近的宣言——这个宣言要求实现我们的建议，这建议是我们在这里以这样的恒心、这样的力量，本着相信我们的事业完全合乎正义的信念，来维护的——的五亿九千六百万人民的声音，也是真正必要的。的确，目前主要的任务就是扑灭在朝鲜的火焰。
    人家对我们说：“这是你们的宣传，这是你们的空话，拿你们的行动给我们看吧。”
    因此，我们要拿行动给你们看。我们要求你们和我们一起走上真正能使战争结束的道路。但是你们拒绝这样做。
    你们欺世惑人地向我们说：“你们说一句话，朝鲜人就会结束战争。”但是你们自己知道这是绝对不真实的。我们可以更有理由地向你们说：“让李奇微说一句话，只要他向他部下的士兵下一个命令，战争就会结束。”
    因此，我们建议在今天讨论议程上第六项议案——关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施——时，再来讨论这个问题！
    有人可能告诉我们：“前天我们才在这里否决了讨论这个问题的建议，为什么你又来强迫我们讨论这个问题呢？”
    是的，我们是在强迫你们讨论这个问题，这样做的理由很简单，你们是应该知道的。我们这样做是因为我们要和平，我们这样做是要防止另一次世界大战爆发，最后，我们这样做是因为我们知道：追求和平的人们必须设法扑灭每一个战争火焰——不管它是在世界上什么地方发生的，而不是去点燃和助长这种火焰。
    鉴于这个问题是我们在这里提交委员会审议的提案的第二项，我们的确坚持委员会应该再讨论这个问题。
    如果我们对于你们的意图和愿望的批评（我们认为你们的愿望是好战的和侵略的愿望）是错误的，那就请你们用行动来证明罢——我是不会因为怕丢丑而不收回我们的话的。请用行动来证明你们不要朝鲜战争继续进行，证明你们真是向我们伸出手来，像你们所说的，是伸出诚实的、和平的、友好的手，而不是侵略和战争的手。我们知道：人们伸出拿着武器的手来的时候，是一定不肯把武器扔掉的。
    先生们，难道你们不了解，如果不尽快解决朝鲜战争问题，那么，大谈你们的“集体措施”计划和你们的裁减军备、均衡地裁减军备的计划便是无用的吗？其所以无用，是因为这些计划会仅仅作为你们的一个决议而搁在你们的档案里，不仅决议如此，就是你们以“临时委员会”之名成立的委员会也是如此。你们把它叫做“小型联大”，要它作为不起作用的安全理事会的某种救援队。可是，这个临时委员会有什么作用呢？它究竟有什么用处呢？
    两年来，它一直没有做一点事。我们也没有听说过它的情形。甚至没有人记得它了。这样的“小型联大”！它是死的联大！它不是小型联大，而是差不多死了的大型联大。你们临时委员会的情形就是这样！然而，你们对于这个问题是通过了决议的。你们当时是兴高采烈的。你们甚至邀请我们参加这个委员会，你们甚至在这个委员会内为我们保留席位，像你们那时所说的，希望我们以后会了解这个委员会的重要性而参加这个委员会。举例说，就像柯亨先生今天在大会上所说的那样，他说：我们（他这样说）希望苏联终于会了解所谓“集体措施”有怎么样的好处而接受这些措施！这是无用的期望！我们过去没有参加而且将来也不会参加临时委员会，因为它是死的，它发出死亡的气息，它发出死尸的气味。你们的这个委员会正在奄奄一息。让它死亡吧。没有人需要它。
    但是，在这个问题上是有过决议的，你们把这种希望寄托在这个决议上。
    请允许我表示我们深切的信念——我并不是要教训你们，我们不敢这样妄想，我只是要表示我们深切的信念。我们认为你们在这次大会上就所谓裁减军备和所谓“集体措施”所通过的决议，是刚诞生就夭折了的婴儿；而我们所建议的，才是有生命的事业。这种事业——设法尽快促成朝鲜的停战——是有生命的事业。如果我们不愿意成为仅仅是某种集团的侵略政策的工具和武器，我们就有责任协助这种事业。
    如果朝鲜问题不能获得解决，那就很难希望国际紧张局面能够和缓下来。因此，解决朝鲜问题是当务之急，而促成朝鲜停战谈判的顺利结束，就是联合国主要的和最重要的责任。
    美国在许多国家建立军事基地威胁各国安全并造成紧张局势
    我们已经谈过，扩军运动和大西洋集团各国，主要是美国，扩大和建立陆海空军基地的行为，是怎样影响了国际局势。
    现在，没有谁不知道，美国在西欧和南欧、在北非和小亚细亚都有海空军基地，而且还在建立新的基地，这些基地分布在十九个国家。这些国家是：挪威、丹麦、荷兰、西德、卢森堡、比利时、英国、法国、西班牙、意大利、法属摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、利比亚、马耳他岛、希腊、塞浦路斯岛、土耳其和埃及。
    此外，还应该指出：美国在远东和亚洲也有基地，特别是在日本、朝鲜、台湾和其他某些地方。
    按照一九五一年九月二十八日第一五五号法律，美国政府拨了二十一亿六千七百万美元在国外建设军事基地。据合众社一九五一年十一月一日的消息。这笔款大部分要用来在全世界建设新的军事基地，扩大现有基地，其中约有十亿美元要用来“在苏联附近建设一些秘密机场”。
    在外国领土上建设军事基地的经费也有一部分是从所谓军事、技术和经济“援助”拨款中来的，这笔款总数有七十三亿二千九百万美元。
    据美国国防部办公厅主任奥哈拉解释说：如果需要建设的某个基地是打算给支援北大西洋公约组织部队的美国武装部队用的，那么，这个基地的建设便算在基层建设计划里。用大西洋集团领袖们的新术语来说，“基层建设”的意义就是这集团全体成员国在西欧合力建设的基地体系。
    这样，美国无异以对其他国家的“援助”为名，实际上建设和扩大它自己的基地。这是美国国防部军事援助司司长欧木斯台德准将在去年九月二十七日举行的小组委员会会议上公开说明的。那时他指出：美国要通过对其他国家的军事和经济援助来贡献它对“基层”建设的一分力量。
    美国已经计划好，要在一九五二年支出约五亿美元在欧洲建设军事基地，包括在土耳其、法国和法属摩洛哥境内的基地在内。
    此外，美国又计划用占领费的名目要被占领国出钱建设基地。众议员斯克利夫纳去年十月十日在国会发言提到基地问题时说：日本已为建设和使用这些设备付出一部分费用，这是当作一部分占领费而付出的（见一九五一年十月十日国会议事记录）。
    在一九五一年，在所谓西欧联盟计划项下的基地建设，就吞没了约一亿美元。这里应该特别提到这个计划分派给英伦三岛的任务。据报纸消息，按照英国和美国的一项协定，英国要逐渐变成巨大的航空母舰，供在同温层飞行的喷气轰炸机起落。战争一旦发生，这种飞机就能够把原子弹送到苏联的心脏地区。在合众社这条消息里，“送到”这个字眼不过是用来掩盖一种无耻的招供，想使人看不出他们打算把这些炸弹投到指定的地方去。
    现在，驻在英国的美国空军官兵有二万名左右，他们在管理目前的轰炸机和战斗机基地。四个新的基地正在建筑中，此外，英美双方还在谈判，要把一些英国空军基地移交美国管理。
    大家知道，英国首相不久以前还说过：工党政府在保守党支持之下所采取的最有意义的措施，是在英格兰东部建立不断扩展的巨大的空军基地，以便用原子武器进攻苏联。邱吉尔硬说苏联有侵略的意图，这完全是为了掩饰建立这种基地的真正目的。日本的战争设备正在大规模地建造着，这是在美国士兵监督之下由日本政府和日本营造公司出资建造的。佐世保港已变成强大的海军基地——在朝鲜的美国军队集中和供应的中心。美国海军第七舰队的舰只和在朝鲜海面上活动的大多数美国船只和外国船只现在都用佐世保作基地。美国海军还充分利用日本横须贺海军基地。神户也用于军事目的，美国特别利用神户的仓库储藏军事物资，以便运往朝鲜。日本伐木、七尾、舞鹤等等海港正在广泛建造军事设备。美国军官和陆军工兵负责监督一切工程。
    据报纸消息，所谓行政协议包括应为一般权利的特别部分，其中包括去年九月初在旧金山签订的美日“安全条约”的秘密条款。在这些一般权利中，连日本到现在为止所享有的有限的独立和主权的影子也看不到。另一方面，这种权利提供了广泛的机会和充分的保证，使美国军事当局能够随心所欲地在日本建立军事基地，利用日本的船只和一般运输工具。
    我们不能轻轻放过这些事实，因为这一切都发生在苏联和我们的远东朋友的邻国。这种情况不能不引起我们关心。不是我们在建立这些基地，而是美国和日本一道在建立这些基地，从而把日本变成美国的桥头堡，或者用英国首相谈到英国时所说的话来说，变成美国的“航空母舰”。
    这是和裁减军备的建议不相容的。可是，那个建议并没有谈到基地。我们现在建议谈谈战争基地，十分坚决地提出必须真正裁减军备和武装部队并且取消在外国领土上的战争基地的这个问题——不这样做当然就完全不能加强和平，不能消除战争的威胁。
    美国一有机会就利用一些国家——甚至最小的国家——来准备战争，准备进攻其他国家。甚至多米尼加共和国也成了美国的好伙伴。美国和这个共和国签订了特别协议，规定驻在佛罗里达的美国空军可以把它的一部分试验场设在这个共和国的领土内，用来试验定向飞弹。
    丹麦的地位也一样。在辽远的北极圈附近的格陵兰西北的萨尔城附近，美国已经建筑了空军基地。据《华盛顿邮报》说，这个空军基地要成为制止共产党对欧洲侵略的另一个有力的工具。这句话应当这样了解：格陵兰的基地要成为对苏联和人民民主国家进行原子攻击的跳板。
    《华盛顿邮报》在一九五一年十月十六日出版的那一期上透露了这一点，它公然说：空军基地已经在格陵兰西北部秘密建立起来了，以便对俄国的任何重要目标进行原子攻击。
    似乎没有比这话再无耻的了！
    这些事实都确实证明了，以美国为首的大西洋集团国家在疯狂地备战。这些事实表明：备战的规模正在不断扩大，使得国际关系更加紧张，它们完全不顾这么做会怎样影响到那些已经被拖入和正在被拖入这种侵略政策范围之内的各国人民的福利。
    责任当然应该由那些疯狂地扩张军备、设立新的基地、公开地扩充现有的海空军基地、恬不知耻地宣扬自己的目的——准备进攻苏联和人民民主国家的这种目的——的人来担负，他们这样做，就造成了这种紧张局势。
    苏联建议五大国裁军三分之一并主张定期举行世界裁军会议
    苏联用自己的和平政策来对抗这种侵略政策。
    一方面，从关于这个问题的决议通过之日起，五大国应该在一年之内，把自己的军备和武装部队裁减三分之一；另一方面，一切国家应该提供关于各该国在外国领土上的军事基地情况的充分而且正式的情报，提供关于各该国军备和武装部队情况的情报，包括关于原子武器的情报。这是两种重要的措施，实施这两种措施，无疑地会缓和国际紧张局势，并有助于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和加强国际和平与友好。
    至于安全理事会五个常任理事国裁减军备和武装部队三分之一的问题，早就有人对这种建议提出了反对意见，这种反对的意见不外是断定这些措施对于缓和国际紧张局势毫无帮助，因为即使采取了这些措施，各国武装部队力量的对比依然如故。除此以外，他们还诡辩说：这种裁减会使苏联处在有利地位，因为这会使苏联对于其他国家的军事优势继续存在。
    我们早就指出过：这种反对意见根本经不起任何批驳，因为所谓苏联有军事优势的这种说法，本身就是没有任何根据的。不但如此，还可以确定，就像我们曾经指出过的，美国和大西洋集团其他国家所拥有的武装部队比苏联多。美、英、法三国的武装部队现在已经超过了战前一九三九年的好几倍，相当于苏联武装部队两倍以上。
    大家都知道，苏联政府已在适当时期使三十三级役龄的人员复员，这件事本身对所有稍微了解动员问题的人说来，是有足够说服力的证据，证明武装部队比战时减少一事已经在苏联实现了。
    同时，大家都知道，像美国总统杜鲁门在一九五二年一月九日致国会的咨文中所证实的，美国武装部队在一九五一年却增加了一百万人以上。
    他们拒绝了我们要求把安全理事会五个常任理事国的武装部队和军备裁减三分之一的建议，竟然不愿考虑下列事实：和扩张军备与不断扩充武装部队的事实适成鲜明的对照，这种裁减一定会对国际关系的性质发生道义上和政治上的巨大影响，使信任加强，使不信任与猜疑消除。
    至于所谓军事上不平等以及必须建立所谓“武装部队的均势”来消除由于这种不平等而产生的危险的说法，历史事实就是有足够说服力的证据，证明这种推理是不足为法的。除此以外，还应该指出这一点：从大西洋集团各国所有权威人物的言论看来，美、英、法三国和它们的盟国的武装部队已经很庞大了，如果说它们必须把武装部队和军备水平提高，使它们可以和其他国家在平等地位上谈实施裁减武装部队和裁减军备问题，这是毫无道理的。
    美国总统在一月间致国会的咨文中断言，联合防御已经在欧洲实现，他所说的“自由国家”已经创立了真正的战斗力量，这种力量已经成了阻止敌对部队横扫欧洲直捣大西洋的任何企图的真正障碍。美国总统之所以要使大家注意这一点，是因为要说明为什么在本届联合国大会上美国敢和英、法两国一道提出裁减军备的问题来，虽然我们都知道，这个建议并没有真正规定裁减军备。杜鲁门说，美国这个建议是具体的、切实可行的裁减军备建议。
    因此，如果以美国为首的三个西方国家所提出的建议着实已经规定了真正裁减军备，或者像杜鲁门所说的，是一个具体的、切实可行的裁减军备建议，那么，“实力均衡”的问题就不再是重要的了。这样一来，反对通过苏联的提案就是没有道理的，苏联的提案主张把武装部队和军备裁减三分之一，主张在提案所规定的日期召集联合国会员国和非会员国举行世界裁减军备会议，以便达到这个提案所指出的目的。
    既然如此，那么，问题是什么呢？如果已经产生了一种力量，这种力量使任何人都不能把自己那种与他人为敌的意图扩展到整个欧洲直到大西洋，那就是说，真正裁减军备和武装部队的时候已经到来了。
    可是他们主张我们仅仅进行调查，而且又把这种调查说成是裁减军备。
    现在我们建议：在尽可能短的时间内，无论如何不能迟于一九五二年七月十五日，举行世界裁减军备会议，而取消在一九五二年六月一日以前举行这种会议的主张。
    苏联主张缔结五大国和平公约作为消除战争威胁的重要保证
    我们过去曾经建议，现在还要建议，缔结五大国和平公约，作为消除另一次战争的威胁和巩固和平的十分重要的保证。同时，我刚才已经说过，我们建议在尽可能短的时间内举行世界裁减军备会议。人家对我们说，我们所建议的日期是不合实际的。我们愿意更改这个日期，从前我们建议不得迟于一九五二年六月一日举行这种会议，现在改为不得迟于一九五二年七月十五日。我们认为这样就会使我们有充分时间去进行真正的准备工作，以便秩序井然地举行这样重要的会议。这样，我们就有一月的一部分和二月、三月、四月、五月、六月整整五个月以及七月的前半个月，一共是六个月的时间来进行准备了。
    我们现在仍然坚决主张缔结五大国——美国、英国、法国、中国和苏联——和平公约，作为消除另一次战争的威胁的十分重要的保证。到目前为止，对于五大国和平公约所提出的反对意见都不能认为是郑重的。譬如，有人说：这种和平公约是不必要的，因为联合国宪章本身就是包罗一切的这样一个公约。可是，除了联合国宪章以外，还有着以消除另一次战争的威胁为目的、以抵制任何侵略的威胁为宗旨的其他协定。例如，苏联和英国、苏联和法国之间的协定就是。而且，在联合国成立以后，还缔结了其他许多多边的条约和协定。因此，在反对缔结和平公约的议论中间，就没有而且也不可能有值得予以任何注意的议论。
    苏联建议在国际监督制度生效时同时执行关于原子武器的禁令
    有特别重大意义的，是禁止原子武器并建立国际监督的问题。这个问题已经在第一委员会讨论过；虽然如此，我认为还有必要再来谈一谈这个问题。
    在这个问题上，苏联所根据的是这样一个事实，就是联合国大会必须立刻宣布无条件禁止原子武器，并且建立严格的国际监督，使这种禁令生效。我们认为：联合国大会同时必须责成裁减军备委员会拟订一个公约草案，规定要采取种种措施，来保证联合国大会关于禁止原子武器、停止原子武器生产、使现有的原子弹只用于和平目的、建立严格的国际监督、使上述公约生效的这种决定得以实现，并且把这个公约草案交给安全理事会审议。
    这个建议引起西方三国的反对，它们硬说在监督制度生效以前无法执行禁令，禁令仍然是虚设的。它们继续固执地为它们的建议辩解，它们主张先建立国际监督制度，然后宣布禁止原子武器。我们为了促进在这问题上达成协议，就建议在宣布无条件禁止原子武器并且建立严格的国际监督的时候，同时应该声明关于原子武器的禁令和国际监督应该同时生效。
    这就应该使得上面所说的反对苏联关于禁止原子武器并建立国际监督的建议，说什么这建议“不切实际”——像西方人士所说的——的一切意见可以打消了。
    我们这个建议无疑开辟了道路，以便在像无条件禁止原子武器并且建立有效而严格的国际监督使这种禁令生效的这样重要的问题上达成协议。
    我们坚决主张立刻由联合国大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器，并且建立严格的国际监督。可是我们赞成在国际监督制度生效时同时执行关于原子武器的禁令。
    至于拟就公约的日期，我们现在取消订为二月一日的主张（在去年十一月说来，这个日期原是可以接受的），而建议订为一九五二年六月一日。
    至于国际监督的性质，在这方面我们也提出了十分重要的建议。我们建议：这种监督应该是“长期的”。我们现在同意把我们的建议按下面的形式提出来：
    “为了建立适当的制度以保证大会关于禁止原子武器与裁减军备的决定得到遵守，国际管制机构有权长期进行视察，但无权干涉他国内政。”
    我们主张宣布建立严格的国际监督的建议，也遭到西方三国的反对。它们拒绝这个建议，说这个建议仅仅是一种宣言，说如果不事先确实达成协议，如果监督制度不开始执行，就没有多大意义。至于监督方面，三国坚持这种监督不应该仅限于个别的视察或检查活动，它们特别重视“长期视察”这个字眼。
    我们根据上面所说的原因，已经把我们原来所提出来的“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施”这个提案作了一些必要的修改，我们认为：通过我们的提案，对于解决当前的种种问题，是十分重要的步骤。（新华社据塔斯社巴黎十四日电）
