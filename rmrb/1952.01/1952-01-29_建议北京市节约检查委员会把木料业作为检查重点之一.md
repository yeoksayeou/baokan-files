    Suggest that the Beijing Municipal Committee for Thrift Examination make the timber industry one of the key areas for inspection
    To the Editor: Last year, Beijing engaged in large-scale construction, and the demand for timber exceeded supply. Many timber merchants sought illegal profits, raising timber prices, with market prices being 100 to 180 percent higher than the listed prices of the Coal Industry Construction Company. Now that the Beijing Municipal Committee for Thrift Examination is conducting inspections of the industrial and commercial sectors, we believe that the timber industry should be one of the key areas of this inspection.
    In our past work, we have discovered many tricks used by timber profiteers to illegally profit. Some forged documents and colluded with corrupt elements in government organs to allocate railway cars and transport timber under the guise of public ownership; some stole and bought public timber; some replaced good materials with inferior ones or small materials with large ones when processing timber for the state, or profited by taking advantage of dimensions; some bought state timber at low prices and sold it at high prices; some earned high commissions by "matching" deals; and some evaded taxes. These illegal activities of the profiteers have caused serious losses to the state and corrupted many cadres.
    We hope that the Beijing Municipal Industrial and Commercial leadership departments, through this inspection, will severely punish profiteers who refuse to confess and, in future work, attach importance to timber management, formulate specific management measures, and prevent profiteers from engaging in speculation and profiteering.

    建议北京市节约检查委员会把木料业作为检查重点之一
    编辑同志：去年北京市大兴土木，木材供不应求。不少木材商人谋求非法利润，抬高木价，市场价格竟比煤业建筑公司的牌价高出百分之一百到一百八十。现在，北京市节约检查委员会正对工商界进行检查，我们认为木业界应是这次检查的重点之一。
    我们过去在工作中，发现木业奸商非法牟利的花样很多。有的伪造证件、串通机关中的贪污分子，假借公家名义，调拨车皮，运销木材；有的盗买公家木材；有的在给国家进行木材加工时，以次料换好料，或以小料换大料，或在尺码上取巧获利；有的低价套购国家木材，高价卖出；有的“跑合”赚取高额佣金；有的偷漏税款。奸商这些非法行为，给国家造成严重损失，并且腐蚀了许多干部。
    我们希望北京市工商领导部门，通过这次检查，严惩拒不坦白的奸商，并在今后工作中，重视木材管理工作，制定出具体管理办法，杜绝奸商投机倒把，谋取暴利的犯法行为。　陈平安　邓　复
