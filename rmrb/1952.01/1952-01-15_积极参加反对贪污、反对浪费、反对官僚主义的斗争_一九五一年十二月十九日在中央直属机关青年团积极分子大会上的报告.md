    Actively Participate in the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy
    —Report at the Conference of Youth League Activists of Central Government Organs, December 19, 1951
    Feng Wenbin
    Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the people of the whole country are currently launching a vigorous and resolute struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Today, I am prepared to talk about the significance of this struggle, the relationship between this struggle and the youth, and how the Youth League can participate in this struggle.
    Why are we launching a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the movement to increase production and practice economy?
    The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made a resolution and issued a call to the people of the whole country to launch a movement to increase production and practice economy. What is the purpose of our movement to increase production and practice economy? Some individuals believe: "This is because our country is poor and there is no other way, so we are launching this movement." Others say: "Increasing production and practicing economy means we have to tighten our belts, and our living standards will be lowered." These views are incorrect. As everyone knows, since the founding of the People's Republic of China two years ago, we have achieved great successes in all areas. The financial and economic situation has been basically stabilized; the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea has achieved great victories; the nationwide land reform movement will be basically completed in 1952; and the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has also yielded great results. Today, the task before us is to continue to strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, strengthen national defense, and prepare for large-scale economic construction, so as to gradually transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. To build a strong national defense, we must first build a defense industry; we must develop resources such as mines, petroleum, coal mines, and iron mines; we must establish automobile manufacturing plants, locomotive manufacturing plants, and more and larger iron and steel plants. After land reform, in addition to organizing themselves, farmers also need a large number of agricultural machines, so that agricultural productivity can be further improved. In order to meet the urgent demand of workers and peasants to learn culture after they have turned over, and to cultivate a large number of construction talents for the country, we must also develop cultural and educational undertakings. In short, to build our country in all aspects, we need a large amount of funds; and the capital accumulation of our new democratic country cannot but rely on increasing production and practicing economy.
    But to launch a movement to increase production and practice economy, we must first launch a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Because corruption, waste, and bureaucracy will cause serious losses to our country's wealth. It's like having rats in a warehouse; we put grain in, and the rats steal it. If this phenomenon is not eliminated, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy. If we do not do things that can be avoided now, if we do not spend money that can be avoided, if we eradicate the phenomenon of waste, and if we eliminate corruption, our country can increase a large amount of wealth. If we invest all this grain in the country's production and construction undertakings, we can open many factories, build many schools, build railways, build ships, and build water conservancy projects. In this way, our country's construction can develop more rapidly, and people's lives can be further improved. Therefore, some people say: "This movement is temporary, like a gust of wind blowing by, and then it's over." This is not correct. The movement to increase production and practice economy is of positive significance, and it is also a long-term movement. It is the fundamental policy for building our country and the driving force for promoting the progress of our country's construction.
    Some people ask: "It has been more than two years since the national liberation, and the Kuomintang reactionary government has long been overthrown. Why is there still corruption?" The matter is very clear. A group of people who originally worked in the Kuomintang government were retained in our state organs, and some of them have not completely transformed their thinking to this day. Many corruption incidents were committed by them. On the other hand, the remnants of the reactionary ruling class and profit-seeking bourgeoisie are constantly trying to corrupt our revolutionary ranks by means of deception and enticement. And those with weak will in our revolutionary ranks have fallen into the quagmire of corruption and degeneration because they have been poisoned by their tricks. As early as the beginning of 1949, when the revolution was about to achieve victory throughout the country, Chairman Mao warned us at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party: "Because of victory, pride within the Party, the mood of considering oneself a meritorious official, the mood of stagnation and not seeking progress, and the mood of craving pleasure and not wanting to live a hard life may grow. Because of victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come out to support us. The enemy cannot conquer us; this has been proven. The bourgeoisie's support may conquer those with weak will in our ranks. There may be some communists who have not been conquered by enemies with guns; they deserve the title of hero in the face of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of bullets wrapped in sugar; they will be defeated in the face of sugar-coated bullets. We must prevent this situation." However, Chairman Mao's instruction has not been valued by every comrade. Some comrades, after entering big cities, were unconsciously eroded by the bad habits of the old society.
    We must actively participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and strive to eliminate all the bad habits and bad influences of the old society, to maintain the purity of our revolutionary ranks, and to protect our country's public property from being stolen. We must make every youth and the broad masses of people clearly recognize that corruption and waste are shameful behaviors, and we must make every youth and the broad masses of people hate corruption and extravagant waste and actively fight against these phenomena. As Comrade Stalin said: "... create an atmosphere of general moral resistance around these thieves and an atmosphere of hatred among the surrounding masses. ... This atmosphere excludes the possibility of theft, so that thieves who steal the people's property, whether 'happy' or 'unhappy,' cannot live and exist."
    The Relationship between the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy and the Youth League and Youth
    Some young people say: This movement has little to do with us, or even no relationship at all. They believe that young people have no possibility of corruption or waste, and there is no bureaucracy to speak of. This understanding is incorrect.
    According to our extremely incomplete statistics from seventeen provinces and cities, among the six hundred or so Youth League members who have been punished, one hundred and twenty have committed the mistake of corruption. In Beijing alone, forty-five Youth League members were punished or expelled from the League for corruption in one year. In other cases, some Youth League members, when traveling on official business, reported two more days of travel dates because the travel expenses were not enough; when the unit entertained guests, they took away the leftover candies; the public tablecloth was taken to mend socks, etc. These acts of harming the public interest are even more common among Youth League members and youth. In addition, some Youth League members and youth, due to a lack of a sense of being the masters of the country, are indifferent to state property and are negligent, causing losses to these properties; such as not turning off the faucet after using tap water, not turning off the lights when not using them, frequently breaking public utensils, and breaking windows because they forgot to close the doors and windows when the wind blows. There are also some young people who like to show off wealth and extravagance, etc. These all show that the phenomena of corruption and waste also exist among Youth League members and youth, and are not uncommon.
    Why does corruption and waste occur among young people?
    The main reason is that some Youth League members and youth have the ideological root of individualism and selfishness, covet personal material enjoyment, and do not care about the interests of the country and the people. Starting from scrounging and taking petty advantages, they gradually develop from small to large, from less to more, from light to heavy, which inevitably leads to serious criminal acts of corruption and waste. Secondly, although young people are relatively simple, most of them come from the old society and lack social experience, and have relatively little training in revolutionary struggles, so they are also easily corroded and lured by bourgeois ideology and landlord ideology without paying attention. For example, someone often goes to the store to purchase materials, and the store owner gives him some cigarettes, which he accepts without thinking it strange. Someone often goes out to eat and drink with corrupt and wasteful people, thinking that there is nothing wrong, but in fact they have been poisoned by the style of corruption and waste, and to some extent participated in the criminal acts of corruption and waste. Another reason is the bureaucracy of the leadership and the liberalism among ordinary comrades, the lack of regular education and strict supervision and inspection, the lack of principled criticism and struggle, and the lack of systems or non-compliance with systems in many matters, which also contributed to the development of corruption and waste.
    Therefore, the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is also of great significance to Youth League members and youth.
    At the same time, our youth should not only examine themselves in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, but also give full play to our characteristics of being brave, active, frank, and unafraid of difficulties, give full play to our active role, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against all corrupt and wasteful behaviors. Youth League members must first realize that the Youth League is a strong and close assistant to the Communist Party and the People's Government; today, the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is the most central task of the Party and the People's Government, and we must play a good role as assistants in this struggle. The Youth League's program stipulates that the Youth League should help the Communist Party and the People's Government to "oppose waste and promote thrift"; the Youth League's constitution also stipulates that "to fight against all acts that harm the people and state property and disrupt public order" is the duty of our League members. At the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Youth League in November of this year, it was also stipulated that increasing production and practicing economy and opposing corruption and waste is the central link of current work. Therefore, Youth League members and youth must never stand idly by in this struggle; on the contrary, if there is serious corruption and waste in a department and the Youth League organization does not know it, or if it knows it and does not carry out a resolute struggle, our Youth League members should be ashamed of it.
    So, what goals should Youth League members and youth achieve in actively participating in this struggle?
    First, improve their understanding and political consciousness in the struggle, and strengthen the sense of being the masters of the country. We must realize that we should contribute everything to the motherland, love all the wealth of the motherland, and truly closely combine our own interests with the interests of the country. We must establish a new morality and a new atmosphere of honesty and public service, active efforts, hard work and simplicity, and daring to fight against all bad phenomena. We must increase the education of social knowledge in the movement to prevent the bad influence of the old society and the old family on ourselves and the erosion of bourgeois and landlord class ideology on ourselves. We must strengthen our ideological antitoxins, anti-corruption toxins, anti-waste toxins, and anti-bureaucratic toxins, and ensure that we do not commit the mistakes of corruption and waste under any circumstances.
    Second, eliminate corruption and waste in the League in this struggle. Appropriately cleanse or educate and transform corrupt elements and speculators in the League to ensure the further purity of the League in ideology and organization.
    Third, promote the entire League organization to better play the active role of the League, enhance the prestige of the League among the masses, further strengthen the ties between the Youth League and the masses, make the Youth League a powerful tool for the Party to unite and connect the broad masses of youth, and further consolidate and expand the League organization.
    What should the Youth League and youth do in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy?
    In the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, Youth League members and youth should first participate in the study of opposing corruption, waste, and bureaucracy under the leadership of the Party Committee and the administration, and use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to eliminate corruption and waste in the League. We call on Youth League members and youth who have committed corruption to confess voluntarily. Those who confess voluntarily and sincerely repent may have their punishment reduced, and those who commit minor offenses may be exempted from punishment. Those who do not confess and are exposed will be severely punished. Youth League members and youth should be brave in admitting mistakes and correcting mistakes. We must explain this truth to Youth League members and youth.
    Secondly, the Youth League organization should mobilize Youth League members and youth to report and expose corruption and waste. Youth League members and youth should actively make rationalization proposals to the administrative leaders to eliminate corruption and waste and improve work efficiency, and help establish necessary systems to block all loopholes that may lead to the theft of state property and eradicate corruption and waste. At the same time, they can also report corruption and waste outside their own departments.
    So, what is corruption? Generally speaking, corruption is stealing the property of the state and the people for oneself. This can be roughly divided into the following three categories: The first category is serious, such as using one's position and authority to sell economic intelligence, causing huge losses to the property of the state and the people; colluding with unscrupulous merchants to steal state property; covering up, bribing, smuggling, evading taxes, and embezzling public funds and materials. The second category is general corruption, roughly including: forging false receipts, kickbacks, embezzling public funds, using public office for private gain, etc. The third category is ordinary, which is generally called "mixing public and private." Here, it is necessary to distinguish between the use of public funds and materials: is it for public use or for personal use, should it be used or should it not be used, must it be used or must it not be used. If these are not clearly distinguished, the boundary between corruption and non-corruption will be blurred.
    Regarding waste, there are also the following situations: The first is that the basic construction plan is not well planned, resulting in losses to the country's wealth; the second is that the accumulation of materials and funds makes it impossible to fully utilize the operating materials; the third is that things that do not need to be done are done, which is also a waste; and there is also waste caused by excessive extravagance, banquets, watching dramas, and visiting gardens, and personal squandering.
    Finally, it should also be explained that in the process of confession and reporting, some ideological concerns may be encountered. Youth League members should actively carry out propaganda work to eliminate various concerns such as fear of losing face, fear of offending people, and fear of future disadvantages to themselves, so that the movement of confession and reporting can be carried out in depth and extensively.
    What should the Youth League do in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy?
    First of all, this struggle should be carried out from the Central Committee of the Youth League all the way down to the grassroots organizations, and a thorough inspection of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy should be carried out in the manner of rectification.
    Second, it is necessary to educate Youth League members and youth to adopt a realistic attitude, and not to conceal, exaggerate, or cover up any waste and corruption.
    Third, those Youth League members and youth who have a high sense of responsibility, are selfless, dare to expose and criticize, and resolutely fight against corruption and waste in this movement should be commended and rewarded. Necessary criticism and punishment should be given to Youth League members and youth who have committed corruption or waste or who have concealed or covered up such acts.
    Fourth, the Youth League branch of the organ should carry out this struggle under the leadership of the Party Committee and the administrative head of the organ. However, if there is suppression of criticism, the Youth League organization or Youth League members should appeal to higher levels and not compromise with the suppression of criticism. We should give full play to the characteristics of youth being active, brave, selfless, and sincerely frank, and wage a resolute struggle against corruption and waste.
    Finally, the Youth League organizations of various organs should report to the Party Committee in a timely manner, and at the same time, the lower-level League committees should report to the higher-level League committees. Good experiences should be exchanged in a timely manner. The Youth League branches should regard the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy as the central task of the current. The League leaders at all levels should use their greatest strength to promote this struggle, give full play to the role of the Youth League, and truly become the Party's closest and most reliable assistant in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    积极参加反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争
    ——一九五一年十二月十九日在中央直属机关青年团积极分子大会上的报告
    冯文彬
    目前在党和人民政府的领导下，全国人民正在大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地开展着反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争。今天我准备讲讲关于这个斗争的意义、这个斗争对青年的关系和青年团如何参加这个斗争的问题。
    为什么我们要在增产节约的运动中开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争？
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议做出了决议，向全国人民提出了开展增产节约运动的号召。我们进行增产节约运动的目的是什么呢？有个别的人认为：“这是因为我们的国家穷了，没有办法了，因此才开展这个运动。”也有人说：“增产节约就是要我们束紧裤带，我们生活水平要降低了。”这些看法都是不对的。大家知道，在中华人民共和国成立两年以来，我们在各方面都获得了很大的成绩。财政经济情况基本上稳定了；抗美援朝运动取得了巨大的胜利；全国土地改革运动在一九五二年内即将基本上完成；镇压反革命的工作也有很大的收获。今天，摆在我们面前的任务，就是要继续加强抗美援朝斗争，加强国防力量，并准备进行大规模的经济建设，以便逐渐地把我们的国家由落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。我们要建设强大的国防，就必须首先建设国防工业，要开发矿山、石油、煤矿、铁矿等资源，要开办汽车制造厂、火车头制造工厂和更多更大的炼铁、炼钢厂。土地改革后，农民除了组织起来之外，还需要大量的农业机器，这样农业生产力才能得到进一步的提高。为了满足工人农民翻身后学习文化的迫切要求，给国家培养大批建设人才，我们又必须发展文化教育事业。总之，要从各方面来建设我们的国家，就要有大量的资金；而我们新民主主义国家的资金积累，不能不依靠增产节约。
    但要开展增产节约运动，首先就必须开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争。因为贪污、浪费、官僚主义会使我们国家的财富受到严重的损失。就像仓库里有了耗子一样，我们一边往里放粮食，耗子一边偷。这种现象不消灭，就难以达到增产节约的目的。如果我们把现在可以不办的事不办，可以不花的钱不花，把浪费的现象根绝了，把贪污的行为肃清了，我们国家就可以增加一笔很大的财富。如果把这些粮食都投资到国家生产建设事业中去，我们就可以开很多工厂，办很多学校，修铁路，造轮船，兴水利。这样，我们国家的建设就可以更迅速地发展起来，人民的生活就能更加得到提高。所以，有的人说：“这个运动是临时的，像一阵风刮过去，就算完了。”这是不正确的，增产节约运动是富有积极意义的，同时也是长期的运动，是建设我们国家的根本方针，也是推动我们国家建设事业前进的动力。
    有人问：“全国解放已经两年多，国民党反动政府早已被推翻，为什么还有贪污现象发生呢？”事情是很明白的。我们的国家机关中曾留用了一批原来在国民党政府里工作的人，他们中间的一部分人到现在还没有彻底改造自己的思想，许多贪污事件就是他们干出来的。另一方面，反动统治阶级的残余分子和唯利是图的资产阶级时刻都企图用欺骗、利诱的手段来腐化我们的革命队伍。而我们革命队伍中的意志薄弱者则中了他们的毒计而堕入贪污蜕化的泥坑。还在一九四九年年初，当革命快要在全国范围内取得胜利的时候，毛主席在党的第七届二中全会上就告诫过我们：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”可是，毛主席这个指示并没有为我们每一个同志所重视，有的同志在进入大城市后，在不知不觉中就被旧社会的不良习气所侵蚀。
    我们必须积极参加反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争，努力肃清旧社会的一切坏作风坏影响，来保持我们革命队伍的纯洁，来保护我们国家的公共财产不被盗窃。要使每个青年和广大人民清楚认识到贪污浪费是一种可耻的行为，要使每个青年和广大人民都痛恨贪污行为和铺张浪费的作风，并积极起来向这些现象作斗争。正如斯大林同志所说的一样：“……在这些贼周围造成一般道德抵制及周围群众憎恨的气氛。……这种气氛排斥偷盗的可能性，使偷窃人民财物的盗贼，不论‘快乐的’或‘不快乐的’，都不能生活与存在。”
    反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义斗争与青年团和青年的关系
    有些青年说：这个运动和我们关系不大，甚至没有关系。他们认为青年没有贪污、浪费的可能，也没有官僚主义可言。这种认识是不正确的。
    我们根据十七个省市极不完全地统计，在六百多个受到处分的团员中，就有一百二十个是犯了贪污的错误的。北京市在一年中就有四十五个团员是因为贪污而受处分和开除了团籍。其他还有的团员因公出差时，路费不够用，多报两天出差日期；机关招待客人时，剩下来的糖果自己拿去吃了；公家发的擦棹布，自己却拿去补袜子用了等等，这些损害公益的行为，在团员和青年中就更为普遍了。还有，有些团员和青年由于缺乏国家主人翁思想，对国家财产漠不关心，玩忽大意，使这些财产遭到了损失；如用完自来水后不关龙头，不用电灯时不关电门，经常打坏公共用具，因为忘了关门窗，刮风时打坏玻璃等。也有一些青年喜欢比阔气、讲排场等等。这些都说明了：贪污、浪费的现象在青年团员和青年中也还是存在着的，而且是不少的。
    为什么在青年中会产生贪污、浪费的现象呢？
    主要的原因是有些团员和青年有着个人主义、自私自利的思想根源，贪图个人的物质享受，不关心国家和人民的利益，从揩油、占小便宜开始，渐渐由小到大、由少到多、由轻到重，这就不可避免地会发展成为严重的贪污、浪费的犯罪行为。其次，青年虽然比较单纯，但是因为大多数出身于旧社会，又缺乏社会经验，受革命斗争的锻炼又比较少，所以也容易在不留意的情况下受到资产阶级思想和地主思想的侵蚀和引诱。譬如有人经常到商店采购物资，商店老板就送他一些香烟，他就不以为怪地收起来。有人经常和贪污、浪费分子去大吃大喝，自以为没有什么，其实已受了贪污、浪费作风的毒害，并且在某种程度上参与了贪污、浪费的犯罪行为。还有就是领导上的官僚主义和一般同志中间的自由主义，没有经常的教育和严格的督促检查，没有进行原则的批评和斗争，许多事情没有制度或不遵守制度，也助长了这种贪污浪费现象的发展。
    因此，反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争对于青年团员和青年，同样有重要的意义。
    同时，我们青年不仅仅要在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争中，检查自己，还要发挥我们勇敢、积极、坦白、不怕困难的特性，发挥我们的积极作用，向一切贪污、浪费的行为作不调和的斗争。青年团员首先要认识到：青年团是共产党和人民政府的有力的亲密的助手；今天，反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争，正是党与人民政府当前最中心的任务，我们必须要在这个斗争中很好地起助手作用。在青年团的团纲上就曾规定了青年团应该帮助共产党和人民政府“反对浪费，提倡节约”；在团章上，也规定了“与一切损害人民及国家财产及破坏公共秩序的行为作斗争”是我们团员的义务。今年十一月青年团中央第二次全体会议上，也规定了增产节约、反对贪污浪费，是当前工作的中心环节。因此，青年团员和青年对于这个斗争绝不能袖手旁观，相反地，如果那一个部门中存在着严重的贪污浪费行为而青年团组织不知道，或知道了而不进行坚决的斗争，我们青年团员就应该引为耻辱。
    那么，青年团员和青年在积极参加这个斗争中，应该达到什么目的呢？
    第一、在斗争中提高自己的认识和政治觉悟，加强国家主人翁的思想。要认识到应该把自己的一切贡献给祖国，要热爱祖国的一切财富，真正地把自己的利益和国家的利益密切结合起来。我们要树立起廉洁奉公、积极努力、刻苦朴实、敢于向一切不良现象作斗争的新的道德、新的风气。我们要在运动中，增加社会知识的教育，以防止旧社会、旧家庭对自己的不良影响和资产阶级、地主阶级思想对自己的侵蚀。必须增强我们思想上的抗毒素，抗贪污之毒、抗浪费之毒、抗官僚主义之毒，保证我们在任何情况之下不犯贪污、浪费的错误。
    第二、在这次斗争中肃清团内的贪污、浪费现象。把团内的贪污分子和投机分子适当地加以清洗或教育改造，保证团在思想上和组织上进一步的纯洁。
    第三、推动全团组织，更好地发挥团的积极作用，提高团在群众中的威信，更加密切青年团与群众的联系，使青年团成为党团结、联系广大青年的有力工具，并且进一步巩固和扩大团的组织。
    青年团和青年应该在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义斗争中做些什么？
    在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争中，团员和青年首先应该在党委与行政的领导下，参加反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的学习，运用批评与自我批评的武器，来肃清团内的贪污行为和浪费现象。我们号召有过贪污行为的团员和青年自动坦白，凡是自动坦白并真诚悔改的，重的可以减轻处分，轻者可以免除处分。如果不坦白而被检举出来的，就要受到严重惩罚。团员和青年应该勇于承认错误，改正错误。我们必须向团员和青年讲清这个道理。
    其次，青年团组织要发动团员和青年检举、揭发贪污行为和浪费现象。团员和青年要积极地向行政领导上提出肃清贪污、浪费现象和提高工作效率的合理化建议，帮助建立必要的制度，以堵塞可能发生盗窃国家财产的一切漏洞，根绝贪污、浪费现象。同时，还可以检举本部门以外的贪污、浪费现象。
    那么，什么叫做贪污呢？一般说，贪污就是把国家人民的财产盗为己有。这大致可分成以下三类：第一类是严重的，如利用自己地位和职权出卖经济情报，使国家人民财产遭到巨大损失；勾结奸商盗卖国家财产；包庇、贿赂、走私、漏税、侵吞公款公物等。第二类是一般的贪污行为，大致有：伪造假单据、回扣、挪用公款、假公济私等。第三类是普通的，就是一般所谓“公私不分”。这里对于支用公款公物必须分别：是公家用、还是自己用，是应该用、还是不应该用，是必须用，还是不必须用。不分清楚这些，就会模糊了贪污与非贪污的界限。
    关于浪费也有下列几种情况：对于基本建设计划不周，因而使国家财富遭受损失，这是一种；积压物资，积压资金，使经营物资不能充分被利用，是另一种；不需要办的事却办了，也是一种浪费；还有讲排场、会餐、看戏、游园过多而超支的浪费和个人的挥霍等。
    最后还应该说明的就是：在进行坦白和检举中，可能遇到一些思想顾虑。青年团员应积极进行宣传工作，以消除怕丢面子、怕得罪人、怕将来对自己不利等种种顾虑，以使坦白和检举的运动能够深入广泛地开展。
    青年团在反对贪污、反对浪费反对官僚主义斗争中，应该怎么做？
    首先，应当把这个斗争，从青年团中央一直深入到基层组织中去，并以整风方式深入地进行一次关于贪污、浪费、官僚主义作风的检查。
    二、必须教育团员和青年，采取实事求是的态度，不隐瞒、不夸大、不包庇一切浪费现象和贪污行为。
    三、对于在这个运动中，具有高度的责任心、大公无私、敢于揭露和批评，坚决与贪污、浪费现象作斗争的团员和青年，要给予表扬和奖励。对于有贪污、浪费行为或有隐瞒、包庇行为的团员和青年，应给以必要的批评和处分。
    四、青年团机关支部应该在本机关党委和行政首长领导下去进行这个斗争。但如发现有压制批评的情形，青年团的组织或团员，应该越级上诉，不要对压制批评的现象妥协。应该发扬青年积极、勇敢、大公无私、诚恳坦白的特性，与贪污、浪费现象进行坚决的斗争。
    最后，各机关青年团的组织应该及时地向党委汇报，同时，下级团委要向上级团委汇报。有好的经验要及时交流。青年团的支部都应把反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义斗争，作为当前的中心工作。团的各级领导，应以最大的力量，来推动这一斗争，发挥青年团的作用，真正成为党在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动中最亲密、最可靠的助手。
