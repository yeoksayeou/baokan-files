Comrades and citizens of Tianjin:

    Our meeting today is very good. Everyone's enthusiasm is very high, and the issues have been explained very clearly. In the half-day since the conference began, we have received over 30,000 reports and confessions. This shows that the people of our city hate corrupt elements, bribe-givers, and illegal merchants. This kind of enthusiasm and this kind of understanding of right and wrong give us the confidence and assurance to thoroughly eliminate corruption, waste, and theft of state assets. I want to thank all the citizens of Tianjin for actively supervising and supporting the People's Government in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. This gives us the confidence and strength to fight against corruption and the theft of state assets. This movement is a very deep and extensive democratic movement. In Chinese history, which dynasty or government has ever been so willing to expose its own weaknesses, so unafraid to reveal all the ugly things, and listen to the people's reports and inspections to oppose these mistakes? Never before in history. The people can criticize the government's shortcomings and errors without any concerns and report all illegal personnel in the government without any restrictions. This gives our People's Government the power to resist corruption and fully maintain its health and integrity.

    Corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are all extremely bad things. If they are not opposed, our People's Government will not be able to serve the people well. Corruption, waste, and bureaucracy will waste state assets and the property that the people have entrusted to the state, making it impossible for our country to accomplish anything. At the same time, if government personnel engage in corruption, their thinking will deteriorate and begin to rot. They will not be able to serve the people well as people's servants, they will become detached from the people, and even become enemies of the people. Therefore, these phenomena cannot be allowed to exist and must be eliminated. The establishment of our People's Government was very hard-won. In a long period of revolutionary struggle, countless people died and shed blood before we achieved victory and established our own People's Government. After the establishment of the People's Government, our country immediately underwent great changes. Because the People's Government was established, the people moved from a life of suffering to a life of happiness and joy. Because the People's Government was established, our production has developed rapidly; the number of educated people is increasing day by day. Because the People's Government was established, our country has changed from a semi-colonial country bullied by imperialism into an independent and powerful country, and no one dares to bully us anymore. In short, since the day the People's Government was established, our country has been developing by leaps and bounds. Now it is just the beginning, and the future is very bright. Even better things are yet to come! Therefore, we must love our country and strictly supervise our government. We must maintain the purity of the People's Government, and therefore we must oppose corruption and bureaucracy.

    Where do these bad things like corruption come from? They mainly come from the bourgeoisie. They are the result of the bourgeoisie's selfish, self-interested, and harmful habits and styles infiltrating our clean People's Government. From the recent confessions and reports of corruption, we can see that most of the corruption is due to bribery from the industrial and commercial sectors. After liberation, the bourgeoisie's selfish, self-interested, and harmful style has not been transformed much. The bourgeoisie uses this bad style and bad habits to entice and infect government personnel, which causes the phenomenon of corruption among government personnel. Therefore, while we oppose these bad styles in government personnel, we must also require the industrial and commercial sectors to oppose this bad style. Yes, many industrialists and businessmen have made contributions to the country. Before liberation, many industrialists and businessmen did not rely on imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, they participated in the country's construction, restored and developed production, and participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. They played a very active role in donating weapons and paying national taxes. These are meritorious to the country and the people, and we will never erase or deny this point. However, there are serious weaknesses of selfishness and self-interest in the industrial and commercial sectors, mainly manifested in enticing cadres, wanting our cadres to learn bad things, and using bribery and corrupt lifestyles to lead them down the wrong path. This is a very bad thing, the most heinous and immoral thing. A revolutionary cadre, a very pure young person, originally had a clean mind and wholeheartedly served the people, but under the inducement of unscrupulous merchants, they were trampled on and ruined. Many revolutionary personnel are corrupted and degenerate because they are seduced by unscrupulous merchants. The example of Wang Shili, a cadre of the tax bureau, is like this. This comrade was originally a young revolutionary soldier in the People's Liberation Army, and he was so pure when he first arrived at the tax bureau! But these unscrupulous merchants used various tricks to lure him, step by step dragging him into the mire, causing him to be contaminated with many despicable and dirty things. Therefore, this bad style of the industrial and commercial sectors cannot be allowed to exist; if it is allowed to exist, it is equivalent to allowing the spread of plagues and diseases, and it is equivalent to allowing the People's Government to collapse. To protect the People's Government and rectify the style of the staff, it is necessary to resolutely fight against all the despicable and dirty behaviors of unscrupulous merchants.

    The actions of unscrupulous merchants not only corrupt cadres, but they also steal state assets every day and every hour. Originally, in a new democratic society, the bourgeoisie has a legal existence, and it is perfectly permissible for them to obtain legitimate profits. They are able to develop and make money. The facts of the three years since liberation fully prove this point. Gentlemen in the industrial and commercial sectors, please think: Have you all made money in the past three years? If you do not bribe, do not evade taxes, and do not take crooked paths, and honestly be a legitimate industrialist and businessman, can you develop and make money? There is no doubt that you can develop and make money. Especially last year, you made a lot of money. You are much better than during the period of Japanese occupation and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, right? In principle, you should be satisfied! Think again about how much care the People's Government has given you since liberation? Restraining state-owned enterprises in the spirit of taking into account both public and private interests, how much business and profit has been taken care of for you in the state's processing orders? Apart from the business that is extremely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood that the state cannot help but do more, isn't a lot of business that it can do itself left for you to do? If you don't have money, you will be lent money, and if you don't have raw materials, you will be allocated raw materials; if you don't have sales channels and the goods are piled up, the government will take them over and bear them for you. Think again: in your factories or shops, the workers and shop assistants, in the spirit of developing production for the benefit of both labor and management, restrain their own treatment and actively produce and operate. Has the production and management efficiency of private enterprises ever been so high? Has the production order ever been so good? In the past, when prices fell and goods were unsalable, workers took the initiative to reduce their treatment to help you overcome difficulties. Have you ever seen or heard of such a government taking care of you like this? Have you ever seen or heard of such workers who know the general situation and understand the overall situation treating you like this? Have you forgotten the situation when Japanese imperialism, American imperialism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries were pressing you so hard that you could hardly breathe? You should know that the government is taking care of you like this to make you develop production well and build a new country together; it is not condoning you to be thieves of the country. Are you still not satisfied? Shouldn't you be content? Indeed, there are many decent industrialists and businessmen who are well-behaved. However, there are still some people who, despite making a lot of money, the workers and shop assistants are working hard to improve production, and the government is taking care of them, they are still not satisfied and still not content. They are still using various methods, taking crooked paths, and insisting on engaging in private interests and fraud, engaging in speculation and trickery, secretly enticing staff members, bribing, evading taxes, smuggling, stealing work and reducing materials, and reselling gold, silver, and foreign exchange, doing those sinful acts that harm others and benefit themselves and endanger the country. This phenomenon, the people can no longer tolerate it! The people want to oppose it and want these people to thoroughly reform and start anew, otherwise they will be severely punished.

    Therefore, while we protect the legitimate interests of industry and commerce, we must also oppose the corrupt thinking and style of the industrial and commercial sectors and the act of stealing state assets. This behavior has corrupted state personnel and caused serious losses to state property. For example, there is a shop in Tianjin that had nothing at the beginning of liberation, but because its boss bribed a government cadre, this cadre colluded with him internally and externally to use his authority to engage in illegal operations. Therefore, in less than two years, he made a lot of money, and tax evasion alone amounted to 4 billion yuan. Where did this money come from? It came from harming countless people and stealing countless state assets to fatten him. Can this phenomenon be allowed to exist? If they exist, we will not exist. The better their lives are and the bigger their fortunes are, the greater the losses suffered by the people and the heavier the disasters suffered by the country. There is no doubt that we should all rise up to catch thieves and catch robbers and arrest these scum!

    Now is the time, the industrial and commercial sectors must be rectified and transformed. We must thoroughly eliminate this bad style that seriously damages the interests of the country and the people, and this immoral behavior. People in the industrial and commercial sectors should realize that it is perfectly permissible and possible to be a legitimate industrialist and businessman and obtain legitimate profits in a new democratic society. As long as you obey the People's Government, accept the leadership of the working class, implement the Common Program, and operate in accordance with policies and laws, you can develop and make money. Even when entering socialism, as long as you are content and abide by the law in this stage of new democracy and actively develop production, you will not be abandoned by the people and will be able to obtain a happy life. But today, we have a very strict requirement for industrialists and businessmen, that is: only legitimate business is allowed, illegal activities are not allowed; only legitimate profits are allowed, stealing state assets is not allowed; only regular dealings with state personnel are allowed, secretly enticing them to engage in private interests and fraud is not allowed.

    The industrial and commercial sectors must reform their bad styles and bad habits. If they do not do so, it will not only be detrimental to the country and the people, but also to the industrialists and businessmen themselves. Decent people must rise up to oppose these evil people, those who have made mistakes must confess and repent, and those unscrupulous merchants who refuse to repent must be attacked by the masses. Get rid of these bad apples, because with the bad apples, not only will the country suffer from them, but legitimate industrialists and businessmen will also suffer from them and will not be able to operate well, and they will also take the blame for them and be accused by the people, unable to hold their heads up. Therefore, in the industrial and commercial sectors, just like in government agencies, we should consciously launch the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state assets, anti-cutting corners, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement, using the methods of criticism and self-criticism, the methods of reporting and confession, and the method of punishing bad apples to thoroughly transform and rectify.

    Of course, in dealing with issues such as bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets, we still adopt the policy of combining education and punishment. That is to say: we must thoroughly and resolutely oppose these bad phenomena and bad behaviors, but it does not mean that all those who have made mistakes must be punished. No, we want to distinguish between the severity of the circumstances. Those who have committed serious crimes and refuse to confess and refuse to repent will of course be severely punished. As for those whose crimes are not serious and who can actively confess and resolutely repent, they will all be leniently treated and educated and transformed. Even if the crimes are more serious, as long as they resolutely repent, they will also be treated leniently. Therefore, those who have made mistakes, as long as they are willing to confess and repent, have a very broad way out, and the door to progress is always open; but if they do not seek progress, do not confess, and do not repent, there is no way to escape, and they cannot get away with it. We also rectify the phenomenon of corruption among government personnel based on this principle.

    In short, this is a very profound transformation movement. We not only demand that it be carried out earnestly in government personnel, rescue those who have made mistakes, and give due punishment to those who have committed serious crimes; but also demand that it be carried out in the industrial and commercial sectors as well, thoroughly eliminating the selfish, self-interested behaviors that have been left over for many years, harming others and benefiting oneself, using public office for private gain, stealing state assets, not loving the country, and not loving the people. If this is not done, purity cannot be maintained in the government, and the role of the People's Government cannot be fully exerted; if this is not done, the bad styles and bad habits of many years cannot be eliminated in the industrial and commercial sectors, and they cannot embark on a healthy and normal development path.

    Finally, I would like to say a few words to all citizens, hoping that everyone will be vigilant and not easily believe rumors. Since the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy and anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-fraudulent state assets movements, some people who do bad things have taken various methods to resist this movement. One of the methods is to spread rumors. For example, when anti-corruption and anti-bribery are to be carried out, they spread rumors saying: "Private invitations to dinner are not allowed!" "Giving gifts is not allowed!" "Borrowing money and owing debts are not allowed!" They also fabricate rumors saying: "If you save, you can't eat white noodles!" "You can't eat stir-fried dishes!" "You can't get a perm!" "You can't wear new clothes!" This is a complete misinterpretation of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. It is a rumor deliberately created by people with ulterior motives and people who have engaged in corruption and bribery, intending to confuse people's minds. These messy rumors have disturbed many people who do not have a clear understanding. In fact, so-called savings refer to not wasting funds, materials, and labor in production, saving working funds in government agencies, and preventing extravagance and waste in the lives of government cadres. It is by no means to reduce the living standards of the people and ordinary staff. "You are not allowed to eat good things, you are only allowed to eat bad things," and "You are not allowed to wear good things, you are only allowed to wear bad things" are completely nonsense. The lives of the people and staff will continue to improve in the development of production. Didn't our wages and supplies of workers and staff in Tianjin increase last year? Moreover, anyone can freely deal with their legitimate life, and can do whatever they want, and others have no right to interfere. So-called corruption and bribery also refer to illegal acts of encroaching on and stealing state assets, which is basically a matter of the relationship between private individuals and the public and the state. As for some personal relationships and social interactions and financial accommodations between private individuals, they have nothing to do with corruption at all. Therefore, I hope that people who have listened to today's broadcast will explain clearly to those who have not heard the broadcast: do not believe rumors, the government does not interfere in the people's private lives and personal interactions. Now, the Spring Festival is approaching, everyone who wants to get a perm can get a perm, those who want to eat dumplings can eat dumplings, those who want to wear new clothes can wear new clothes, and those who want to buy New Year's goods can buy New Year's goods.

    Let us carry out the "Three-Anti" movement more deeply! Let us achieve greater victories and have a good Spring Festival. (Xinhua News Agency)

专栏：

    天津市长黄敬一月十六日在天津市各界人民反贪污反浪费反官僚主义坦白检举大会上的讲话全市市民、同志们：
    我们今天这个会开得很好，大家情绪非常热烈，问题也都讲的非常清楚。在大会开会这半天内，我们就收到检举坦白案件三万多件，这说明我们全市人民是痛恨贪污腐化分子、痛恨行贿分子、痛恨不法商人的。这样一种热情，这样一种认清是非的态度，就使我们有信心有把握能够彻底肃清贪污、浪费和盗窃国家资财的现象。我要感谢全市市民，你们在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，积极监督了支持了人民政府，就使我们和贪污腐化、盗窃国家资财的现象作斗争时有了把握，有了力量。这次运动是一个非常深入、非常广泛的民主运动。我们中国历史上，哪一个朝代，哪一个政府，能这样勇于揭发自己的弱点，这样不怕把一切丑事揭开，听从人民检举、检查，来反对这些错误？历史上从来没有过的。人民对政府可以毫无顾虑地批评政府的一切缺点和错误，毫无约束地检举政府中的一切不法人员，这就使我们的人民政府有了抵抗腐蚀的力量，就能够充分地保持它的健康和廉洁。
    贪污、浪费、官僚主义都是极坏的事情，要不反对掉，我们人民政府就不能好好给人民办事，贪污、浪费和官僚主义就会把国家资财，把老百姓交给国家的财产白白消耗掉，使我们国家什么事也办不起来。同时，人民政府工作人员有了贪污腐化的行为，就会使他思想变质，开始腐烂，他就不能好好地做人民的勤务员来为人民服务，他就要脱离人民，甚至变成人民的敌人。所以这些现象不能容许存在，必须消灭。我们人民政府的建立，是非常不容易的。在长时期革命斗争中，不知死了多少人，流了多少血，才取得胜利，才把人民自己的政府建立起来。人民政府建立以后，我们国家马上就发生了大的改变。因为建立了人民政府，人民就从痛苦的生活进到幸福快乐的生活。因为建立了人民政府，我们的生产就猛烈地发展起来；受教育的人一天一天多起来了。因为建立了人民政府，我们国家就由被帝国主义欺侮的半殖民地的国家变成独立的强大的国家，再也没有人敢欺侮我们了。总之，自从建立了人民政府的那一天起，我们国家就突飞猛进地发展起来了。现在还不过刚开始，前途远大得很，更好的还在后头！因此，我们要热爱我们的国家，要严格地监督着我们的政府。我们一定要保持人民政府的纯洁，因此就一定要反对贪污腐化和官僚主义的现象。
    贪污腐化这些坏事是从哪里来的？主要是从资产阶级那里来的，是资产阶级的自私自利、损人利己的坏习气、坏作风侵入到我们廉洁的人民政府中的结果。我们从最近坦白检举的贪污材料中可以知道：绝大部分贪污是由于受到工商界的贿赂。解放了，资产阶级的这种自私自利损人利己的坏作风还没有得到多少改造；资产阶级用这种坏作风、坏习气勾引着传染着政府的工作人员，才使工作人员发生了贪污腐化的现象。因此我们在政府工作人员中来反对这些坏作风，就必须同时要求工商界也来反对这种坏作风。是的，许多工商业者对国家是有贡献的，在解放以前，许多工商业者没有依附帝国主义和国民党反动派，解放后，他们参加了国家的建设，恢复发展了生产，参加抗美援朝运动；在捐献武器、缴纳国税等方面，都起了很多的积极作用，这些对国家和人民是有功的，我们决不抹杀这一点，否认这一点。但是在工商界里存有严重自私自利损人利己的弱点，主要表现在勾引干部，要我们干部学坏，用行贿、用腐化的生活，勾引他们往坏道上走，这是一种很坏的事情，是最伤天害理最缺德的事情。一个革命干部，一个很纯洁的青年，头脑中本来干干净净，一心为人民服务，可是在奸商的引诱下，被糟踏了，断送了。刚才税局干部王世礼的例子就是这样。这位同志原是解放军中的一个青年革命战士，刚到税局时是多么纯洁！可是这些奸商用种种圈套引诱他，一步一步把他拖下污泥坑里，使他沾染了很多卑鄙龌龊的东西。许多革命的工作人员腐化堕落都是这样被奸商引诱造成的。所以工商界这种坏作风，绝不能容许存在；如容许存在，就等于容许瘟疫疾病蔓延传染，就等于容许人民政府垮台。要爱护人民政府，要整顿工作人员的作风就必须和奸商的一切卑鄙龌龊的行为进行坚决的斗争。
    奸商们的行为还不只腐蚀干部，他们还在每日每时地盗窃着国家资财。本来新民主主义社会中，资产阶级是合法存在的，他们取得正当的利润是完全容许的。他们是能够发展的，能够赚钱的。解放三年来的事实，充分证明了这一点。工商界的各位先生们，请你们想想：三年来你们是否都赚了钱了？你们不行贿、不偷税、不走歪道，老老实实地做一个正当工商业者，你们是否可以发展，是否可以赚钱呢？毫无疑问，是能够发展，能够赚钱的。特别是去年一年，你们赚了很多的钱，你们比日寇统治时期、比国民党反动统治时期是好的太多了吧？照理说，应该知足了吧！你们再想想人民政府在解放后给了你们多少照顾？约束着国营企业本着公私兼顾的精神，在国家的加工定货中照顾了你们多少买卖，给了多少利润？国营企业除了对于国计民生关系极大的买卖不能不由国家多做以外，不是放着很多自己能做的买卖不做，留下让给你们做吗？没钱借给你们钱，没原料分配给你们原料；没销路，货积压着，政府收过来替你们扛着。你们再想想：你们的工厂或商店里，工人和店员们本着发展生产劳资两利的精神，约束着自己的待遇，积极地生产和营业，私营企业的生产和经营效率从来有过这样高吗？生产秩序从来有现在这样好过吗？前年在物价回跌，货物滞销时，工人们还主动地降低了自己的待遇，帮助你们克服困难。你们以前是见到过还是听到过有这样的政府这样照顾过你们吗？你们以前是见到过还是听到过这样识大体明大义的工人曾经这样地对待过你们吗？难道你们已经忘记了日本帝国主义、美国帝国主义和国民党反动派把你们压得喘不过气来，奄奄一息的那个时候的情形了吗？你们应当知道政府这样照顾你们，是要你们好好地发展生产，一起建设新的国家；不是纵容你们做国家的盗贼。难道你们还不知足吗？还不应当安分吗？的确有不少正派的工商业者是规矩的。可是，偏偏还有些人，钱尽管赚得多，工人店员尽管在努力改进生产，政府尽管照顾着他们，他们却依然不知足，依然不安分。他们仍在利用各种方法，走歪道，偏要营私舞弊，投机取巧，偷偷摸摸地勾引工作人员，行贿、偷税、走私、偷工减料、倒卖金银外汇，干那些损人利己危害国家的罪恶勾当。这种现象，人民再也不能忍耐了！人民要反对它，要这些人痛改前非，来重新作人，不然就要加以严厉的惩办。
    所以，我们固然要保护工商业的正当利益，同时也要反对工商界里那种腐朽的思想作风和盗窃国家资财的行为。这种行为曾使国家的工作人员受到腐蚀，国家财产受到严重损失。举例来说，天津市有这样一家商店，解放之初一无所有，但由于它的老板贿赂了政府工作干部，这个干部就和他里应外合地利用职权来作不法经营，因此不到两年，他发了很大的财，仅偷税就有四十亿元。这钱是哪里来的呢？是不知坑害了多少人，不知偷窃了国家多少资财，把他养肥的。这种现象难道能容许它存在吗？有他们就没有我们，他们的生活过得越好，他们的财发得越大，人民受的损失就越大，国家遭的殃就越重。毫无疑问的，我们应当一齐起来捉贼，抓强盗，把这些败类抓起来！
    现在，是时候了，工商界不能不整顿、不改造了。不能不把这种严重破坏国家和人民利益的坏作风，把这种不道德的行为彻底消灭掉了。工商界人士应该认识：作一个正当工商业者，取得正当的利润，在新民主主义社会中，是完全容许的、可能的。只要你们服从人民政府，接受工人阶级的领导，执行共同纲领，按政策法令经营，你就能够发展，能够赚钱。即使进入社会主义时，只要在新民主主义这个阶段里安分守法，积极发展生产，同样是不会被人民抛弃的，同样是能够得到美满的生活的。但在今天，我们对工商业者却有一个非常严格的要求，这就是：只许做正当的营业，不许做非法的勾当；只许取得正当利润，不许盗窃国家的资财；只许规规矩矩地和国家工作人员来往，不许偷偷摸摸地勾引他们营私舞弊。
    工商界必须改革掉坏作风、坏习惯，不这样做，不仅对国家对人民不利，对工商业者自己也是不利的。正派的人要起来反对这些邪恶的人，有过错的人要坦白改过，对于怙恶不悛的奸商要群起而攻之，去掉这些害群之马，因为有了害群之马，不仅国家受他们的害，正当工商业者也要受他们的害不能好好营业，而且替他们背黑锅，受到人民的指责，抬不起头来。所以在工商界中，也应像在政府机关里一样自觉地开展反行贿、反偷税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动，用批评与自我批评的方法，用检举与坦白的方法，用惩办害群之马的方法来彻底改造与整顿一下。
    当然，在处理行贿、偷税、盗窃国家资财等问题上，我们还是采取教育与惩办相结合的方针的。就是说：对于这些坏现象、坏行为，我们必须彻底地坚决地反掉，但并不是说所有犯错误的人都要一律惩办。不是的，我们是要分别情节轻重的。对那些罪恶重大、又拒不坦白，怙恶不悛的，当然要严惩。至于罪恶并不重大、又能积极坦白、坚决悔改的，则对之一律宽大，采取教育改造的方法。就是罪恶较大，只要坚决悔过，也是处理从宽的。因此，有错误的人只要肯坦白、悔过，出路是很宽的，进步的门总是开着的；但如果不自求进步，不坦白，不改过，逃路却是没有的，混是混不过去的。我们整顿政府工作人员反对贪污腐化现象也就是本着这个原则的。
    总之，这是一个非常深刻的改造运动，我们不仅要求在政府工作人员中认真地展开，把犯错误的人挽救回来，对罪恶重大的给以应有的惩处；同时也要求在工商界中同样地展开，把很多年来遗留下的损人利己、假公济私、盗窃国家资财、不爱国家、不爱人民的自私自利行为彻底消灭掉。不这样做，在政府中就不能保持纯洁，不能充分发挥人民政府的作用；不这样做，在工商界中就不能肃清多年来的坏作风、坏习惯，就不能走上健康的正常发展的道路。
    最后，我还要向全体市民讲几句话，希望大家提高警惕，不要轻信谣言。自从反贪污反浪费反官僚主义和反行贿、反偷税、反欺诈国家资财运动开展以后，有些做坏事的人采取各种方法来抵抗这一运动。其方法之一就是乱造谣言。譬如要反贪污反行贿了，他们就放空气说：“私人之间不许请客吃饭了！”“不许送礼了！”“不许借钱，欠债了！”他们又捏造说：“节约了，不准吃白面了！”“不准吃炒菜了！”“不准烫发了！”“不准穿新衣服了！”这完全是对反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动的曲解，是别有用心的人，是有贪污、行贿行为的人故意制造的谣言，意图惑乱人心。这些乌七八糟的谣言，已使许多认识不清楚的人发生惊扰。其实，所谓节约，是指在生产上不浪费资金、材料和人工，在政府机关里节约工作经费，在政府工作干部中防止生活上的铺张浪费，决不是要降低人民及一般工作人员的生活水准。“不许吃好的，只许吃坏的”，“不许穿好的，只许穿坏的”，完全是胡说。人民和工作人员的生活，在生产发展中，还要不断提高的。去年我们天津市的工人和工作人员的工资和供给不是调整提高了吗？而且，无论任何人，只要是正当的生活，自己就完全可以自由处理，愿干什么干什么，别人没有权利干涉。所谓贪污、行贿，也是指侵占、盗窃国家资财的不法行为而言，基本上是私人对公家、对国家的关系问题。至于私人之间的一些人情往来应酬，金钱通融，根本与贪污无关。因此，希望听了今天的广播的人，向没有听到广播的人讲清楚：不要听信谣言，政府对于人民的私生活、对于人情往来，是不干涉的。现在，春节快到了，大家要烫发的尽管烫发，要吃饺子的尽管吃饺子，要穿新衣服的尽管穿新衣服，要办年货的尽管办年货。
    让我们更深入地开展“三反”运动吧！让我们取得更大的胜利，好好地过这个春节。（新华社）
