    The Transportation Management Office of the Northwest Railway Main Line Engineering Bureau held its second transportation meeting from December 19th to 22nd last year. A total of 88 people attended, including section chiefs and worker representatives from locomotive depots, train sections, and various stations. The conference heard a basic summary of the transportation work in 1951 and a report on the work tasks for 1952, as well as important instructions from Bureau Chief Wang Shitai regarding the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign.
    Everyone engaged in in-depth discussions based on these two reports, unanimously affirming the achievements made in the past year and specifically discussing how to overcome difficulties and complete the 15 billion yuan savings task for 1952. Locomotive depots proposed to achieve savings by reducing axle loads, conserving locomotive coal, and strengthening the maintenance and repair of locomotives. Various stations prepared to strengthen vehicle allocation, increase freight car turnaround rates, shorten vehicle dwell times to save vehicles, strengthen professional learning, reduce liability accidents, and maximize transportation capacity in order to strive for the opening of the railway to Lanzhou in 1952.
    The meeting, in conjunction with the report on the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, greatly educated and enlightened everyone when inspecting the actual work in various places. Many serious bureaucratic styles and corrupt and wasteful phenomena have been exposed at the meeting. Zhu Chaozhen, the stationmaster of Tuoshi Station, left documents in his drawer for six or seven days without looking at them, and when others asked, he said it was confidential. Li Guangyan, the former stationmaster of Yanjiahe Station, did not accept trains while on duty, but slept at home. When someone came to call him, he said, "So many trains are coming, it's too much trouble!" Wu Bin, the stationmaster of Linjiacun Station, and the deputy stationmaster were not united, and even did not speak to the worker representatives attending the transportation meeting, concealed accidents, and partnered with others to do firewood business (selling firewood) at Donggou Station. Wang Tingqi, the former section chief of the locomotive depot, had a very serious bureaucratic style, did not seek progress, did not unite the masses, and did not go deep into the lower levels, resulting in huge waste of state funds. For example, boiler steel plates were not needed originally, but he obtained 6,000 kilograms, which were stockpiled and could not be used, and were left in the yard to be eroded by wind and rain, wasting 25 million yuan; when making locomotive toolboxes, the dimensions were not correct, and as a result, after seven large boxes were made, they could not be placed on the locomotives, wasting 11.6 million yuan; top picks were bought but could not be used, and were returned to the material factory, wasting 60 million yuan; in 1951, the original plan was to inspect ten locomotives in Class A, costing 130 million yuan per locomotive, but in the end, each locomotive inspected in Class A only cost 35 million yuan; based on the rough statistics of the few materials currently understood, the wasted, stockpiled, and lost materials amounted to more than 3.59 billion yuan. Everyone realized the huge waste caused by bureaucracy, especially Wang Tingqi's staggering waste figures, and spoke one after another, waging a merciless struggle against the bureaucratic style. Many people said, "We are reluctant to use even a piece of paper or a drop of oil in the mountains, but we never thought that there would be such a large waste in the locomotive depot!" Finally, the director accepted everyone's unanimous request and, with the approval of the bureau chief, announced a temporary punishment of dismissal and a five-grade salary reduction for the bureaucrat Wang Tingqi. The final punishment will be decided after the democratic reform.
    Through this struggle, everyone saw that corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are really deadly things that must be thoroughly exposed and eliminated. Everyone pledged to implement the spirit of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy in all sections and stations, and expressed their determination to implement the various technical indicators for the opening of the railway to Lanzhou this year; many units have formulated specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy.
    Finally, the conference listened to a report by Lu Kejun, chairman of the trade union, on the self-reform of intellectuals. Everyone said: This meeting is worth a year of school. The three major meetings held this year have been truly educational.

    西北铁路干线工程局召开运输会议讨论贪污浪费现象
    官僚主义分子王廷琦被撤职降薪五级
    西北铁路干线工程局运输管理处，去年十二月十九日至二十二日召开了第二届运输会议。到会的有机务段、列车段各站、段长及职工代表计八十八人。大会听了关于一九五一年运输工作的基本总结和一九五二年工作任务的报告，和王世泰局长关于反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动的重要指示。
    大家根据这两个报告作了深刻的讨论，一致肯定了过去一年来已经获得的成绩，并具体讨论了如何克服困难，完成一九五二年节约一百五十亿元的任务。机务段提出从超轴、节省机煤及加强机车的保养和检修等方面来实行节约；各车站准备加强车辆的调配工作，提高货车周转率，缩短车辆停留时间，以节约车辆，加强业务学习，减免责任事故，发挥最大的运输能力，为在一九五二年通车兰州而奋斗。
    会议结合反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的报告，检查各地实际工作的时候，给大家的教育启发很大。会上已暴露出不少严重的官僚主义作风和贪污浪费现象。拓石站长朱朝祯将文件放在抽屉内六、七天不看，别人来问他还说是保密。原彦家河站长李广炎，值班不接车，在家睡觉，有人来叫，他还说：“来这么多的车，麻烦透了！”林家村站长吴斌和副站长不团结，甚至不和参加运输会议的职工代表说话，隐瞒事故，在东沟站时和别人合伙做木柴生意（卖柴）。机务段前任段长王廷琦官僚主义作风很厉害，不求进步，不团结群众，不深入下层，结果造成国家资金巨大的浪费。如锅炉钢板本来不需要，他却搞到六千公斤，积压起来用不上，放在院里让风雨侵蚀，浪费二千五百万元；作机车工具箱时，尺寸没弄正确，结果七个大箱作成以后，机车上放不下，浪费了一千一百六十万元；顶镐买了不能用，又退回材料厂，浪费六千万元；一九五一年原计划甲检机车十台，每台一亿三千万元，结果甲检机车每台仅用三千五百万元；单从目前了解的几项材料的粗略统计，浪费的、积压的、损失的就有三十五亿九千多万元。大家知道了官僚主义造成的巨大浪费，尤其是王廷琦惊人的浪费数字，纷纷发言，与官僚主义作风作了无情的斗争。许多人这样说：“我们在山沟里一张纸、一点油都舍不得多用，想不到机务段竟有这么大的浪费！”最后处长接受大家一致的要求，经局长批准后，宣布给官僚主义分子王廷琦以撤职及降薪五级的暂时处分，最后处分待民主改革后再作决定。
    经过这一次斗争，大家看出贪污浪费和官僚主义真是害死人的东西，非彻底揭发消除不行。大家保证把反贪污浪费和反官僚主义的精神贯彻到各段、站，并对今年通车兰州的各种技术指标，表示了贯彻执行的决心；很多单位都订出了具体的增产节约计划。
    大会最后听取工会路克军主席关于知识分子自我改造问题的报告。大家说：这次会议顶上一年学校，今年开了这样三次大会，教育确实太大了。
