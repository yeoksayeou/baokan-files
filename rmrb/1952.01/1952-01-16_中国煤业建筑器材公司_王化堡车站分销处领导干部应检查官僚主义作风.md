    China Coal Mine Construction Equipment Company
    Leading Cadres of the Wanghuabao Railway Station Distribution Office Should Examine Bureaucratic Work Style

    Comrade Editor: The leading cadres of the Wanghuabao Railway Station Distribution Office of the China Coal Mine Construction Equipment Company's Hebei Province Branch in Handan County have a serious bureaucratic work style. The distance from Wanghuabao to Suli is thirteen li, but the distribution office pays transportation workers based on a distance of eight li. Only after the workers repeatedly raised their concerns was a reasonable solution reached. When moving coal from inside the railway tracks to outside, wages should vary depending on the distance and the height of the piles, but the distribution office has no clear regulations on this. The workers have requested a solution to this problem, and the Handan County Federation of Trade Unions and the grassroots trade union of the distribution office have repeatedly suggested signing a contract. However, this matter remains unresolved to this day. Zhang Yuqing, of the Distribution Office's Business Section, usually doesn't pay attention to politics. Upon seeing the porters studying after work, he asked Li Ying, the chairman of the grassroots trade union, "What are you doing?" Li Ying replied, "Everyone is studying politics." Zhang then said, "Who told you to study? There's so much coal, why aren't you moving it!" and threatened the workers to go and move it. We believe that the leading cadres of the distribution office should examine this bureaucratic work style.

    中国煤业建筑器材公司
    王化堡车站分销处领导干部应检查官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：中国煤业建筑器材公司河北省公司邯郸县王化堡车站分销处领导干部，有严重的官僚主义作风。从王化堡到苏里有十三里，但分销处发给运输工人工资，却按八里计算。经工人一再提出意见，才得到了合理的解决。搬运工人从火车道内向道外搬运煤炭时，因距离远近和堆高低不同，工资应有区别，但分销处对此却无明确规定。工人要求解决这个问题，邯郸县总工会和分销处基层工会也一再提出订立合同的意见。但这件事一直到现在仍没有解决。分销处业务科张玉清平时不问政治，看见搬运工人下班后在学习，就对基层工会主席李英说：“你们在干什么？”李英回答：“大家正在学习政治。”张又说：“谁叫你们学习的？煤炭有这么多，你们还不去搬运！”并威胁工人去搬。我们认为分销处领导干部应检查这种官僚主义作风。
