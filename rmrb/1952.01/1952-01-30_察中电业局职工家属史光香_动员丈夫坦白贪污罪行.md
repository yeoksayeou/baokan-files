Shi Guangxiang, a family member of an employee of the Chabei Power Bureau in Chahar Province, mobilized her husband, Wang Tianbing, to confess his embezzlement.

In the first half of 1949, when Wang Tianbing was the chairman of the labor union and a labor protection committee member at the business office, he privately misappropriated more than 800 jin of millet from the labor protection fund. During this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, when the employees raised this issue to him in group meetings, he did not honestly confess. His wife, Shi Guangxiang, remembered the employees' usual comments: "The labor protection committee member's accounts are unclear." So, she said to Wang Tianbing, "I heard that those with problems have confessed. What about you?" Wang Tianbing replied angrily, "I don't have any, what is there to confess?" There were no results. Shi Guangxiang went to talk to the family members of other employees and heard reflections about her husband's problems again. When Wang Tianbing came home from work, Shi Guangxiang deliberately ignored him while holding the child. He saw that Shi Guangxiang had not prepared food for him and sat angrily on the edge of the kang. At this moment, Shi Guangxiang raised the child with both hands, kissed the child, and said to the child, "You are out of luck to have found such an embezzler for a father! The higher authorities are calling for confessions, but he refuses to confess and wants to be stubborn to the end!" Wang Tianbing listened quietly, and after a while, said, "What do you want me to confess?" Shi Guangxiang said, "You know what you did. If you don't explain the accounts clearly to the comrades, then we'll have nothing to do with each other in the future." Wang Tianbing thought of the days of persecution in the past, and then thought of the increasingly better days after liberation. He also thought that the Communist Party had cultivated him; and he was the chairman of the labor union, not as progressive as his wife. He felt extremely sad. Finally, Wang Tianbing made up his mind to confess to everyone. At the group meeting that day, he fully confessed his embezzlement. He expressed his desire to be a new person.

    动员丈夫坦白贪污罪行
    察哈尔省察中电业局营业所职工家属史光香动员丈夫王天丙坦白了贪污行为。
    王天丙在一九四九年上半年任营业所工会主席兼劳保委员时，从劳保金中私自挪用了八百多斤小米。在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，职工们在小组会上给他提出这个问题时，他不老老实实坦白。他的妻子史光香想起了职工们平时的反映：“劳保委员的账目不清楚。”于是，她对王天丙说：“听说有问题的都坦白了，你呢？”王天丙气冲冲地回答：“我没有，坦白什么？”没有结果。史光香去找别的职工们的家属谈天，又听到关于她丈夫有问题的反映。王天丙下班回来，史光香抱着孩子故意不理他。他看史光香饭也没有给他弄，很生气地一屁股坐在炕沿上。这时，史光香双手举起孩子，一面亲吻孩子一面对孩子说：“你算倒了霉啦，怎么找了这么一个贪污分子爸爸？上级号召，也不去交代，要顽固到底呢！”王天丙悄悄听着，待了一会儿说：“你叫我坦白啥？”史光香说：“自己作的事，自己知道。不把账向同志们交代清楚，咱们以后谁也别理谁。”王天丙想起了过去受迫害的日子，再想到解放后一天比一天好的日子。他又想到共产党培养了他；并且自己是工会主席，还不如自己老婆进步。他心里难过极了。最后，王天丙下定决心向大家坦白。在当天的小组会上，他全部坦白了自己的贪污行为。他表示要重新作人。
