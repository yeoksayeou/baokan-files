Respected Chairman Mao: Responding to your call to "get organized and develop production," our production has been growing and our lives have become more beautiful and prosperous over the past decade. Now, almost every family has surplus grain, the villages are forested with trees, cattle and sheep are plentiful, and transport vehicles are constantly moving on the roads, presenting a prosperous scene.

We would particularly like to report to you on our achievements in achieving high yields in 1951. Among us, ninety-five mutual aid teams achieved the following: 1. Improved technology. These mutual aid teams established a total of seventy-four small farms, conducting experiments on seeds, fertilizers, and farming methods according to the four different soil types of flats, ditches, ridges, and mountains, in order to improve technology; and they tried to promote and use new-style agricultural tools as much as possible. This laid a solid foundation for high agricultural yields. 2. Actively engaged in sideline production to avoid idle labor. This item generated a large income. 3. Closely integrated with supply and marketing cooperatives. Ninety groups, totaling more than 2,900 people, all joined the supply and marketing cooperatives. The mutual aid team leader is also the cooperative member group leader, responsible for planning the goods needed by the members and promoting sales of products, so that the supply and sales of members' goods are timely. In addition, the ninety-five mutual aid teams cultivated 570 mu of land for military families, increasing grain production by 1 to 2.5 dou per mu. Among our mutual aid teams, there also appeared four advanced forms of groups, namely agricultural production cooperatives. Its advantage is that it can relatively fully exploit the potential of labor and land, so it is easier to increase yields.

In terms of donations, our mutual aid teams donated a total of more than 14,700 jin of grain and 4.7 million yuan in RMB in the past year.

Now, we, the 130 labor models and technical experts, are gathered here to celebrate the harvest and exchange experiences. We unanimously expressed our determination to resolutely respond to your call for increasing production and practicing economy, and decided to first do the following three tasks: 1. Formulate practical and feasible patriotic compacts based on actual conditions. 2. Organize all forces to invest in winter sideline production, mainly transportation and various handicrafts. 3. Prepare enough coal or firewood for eight months for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, and accumulate 65 dan of fertilizer per mu; each household in the group should prepare enough coal or firewood for six months, and accumulate 55 dan of fertilizer per mu; and new-style agricultural tools should be added. We want to prepare for increasing the yield per unit area in 1952. We wish you good health forever.

    共同交流农业丰产经验  保证作好丰产准备工作
    敬爱的毛主席：我们响应您所指示的“组织起来，发展生产”的号召，十余年来，生产越来越发展，生活越过越美满富裕了。现在我们差不多家家有余粮，村里树木成林、牛羊成群，道上运输大车络绎不绝，一派兴盛气象。
    我们特别要向您报告一九五一年的丰产成绩。我们中间，有九十五个互助组，作到了下列各点：一、改良技术。这些互助组共成立了七十四个小农场，按照坪、沟、岗、岭四种不同土质，进行种籽、肥料、耕作方法的试验，以求改进技术；并尽量推广和使用新式农具。这就为农业丰产打下了深厚的基础。二、积极搞副业生产，不使劳力空闲。这一项收入很大。三、和供销合作社密切结合。九十个组共二千九百多人，全部加入了供销合作社。互助组长就是社员组长，他负责计划社员需用的物品，推销产品，使得社员物品的供销都很及时。此外，九十五个互助组共替军属代耕了五百七十亩地，每亩地增产粮食一斗到二斗半。在我们这些互助组中，还出现了四个高级形式的组，就是农业生产合作社。它的优点是能比较充分地发挥劳力和土地的潜在能力，因而产量容易提高。
    在捐献方面，一年来，我们的互助组一共捐献了一万四千七百多斤粮食，人民币四百七十多万元。
    现在我们这一百三十个劳动模范和技术能手聚集在一堂，共同庆祝丰收，交流经验。我们一致表示，坚决响应您的增产节约号召，决定首先做好以下三件工作；一、根据实际情况，订出切实可行的爱国公约。二、组织一切力量，投入冬季副业生产，主要是运输和各种手工业。三、要为革命烈士家属、军人家属准备足够八个月用的煤或柴，每亩地积肥六十五担；组内各户要准备足够六个月用的煤或柴，每亩地积肥五十五担；并要添置新式农具。我们要为一九五二年提高单位面积产量作准备工作。祝您永远健康
