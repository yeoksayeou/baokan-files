    China Petroleum Company
    North China District Company Should Profoundly Examine the Motive Behind Repeatedly Hosting Banquets for Inspection Personnel
    Editor: The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on December 25, 1951, published reader Zhang Zhenfang's criticism of the China Petroleum Company North China District Company for hosting a banquet for inspection personnel after a warehouse fire. I did not participate in that event, but I committed the same kind of error in another event. In July 1951, I represented the China Petroleum Corporation as part of an "Inspection Team" organized by the Central People's Supervisory Committee to inspect a case at the China Petroleum Company North China District Company. At the beginning and end of the inspection, the China Petroleum Company North China District Company hosted banquets for all inspection personnel, including representatives from the Central People's Supervisory Committee, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, the Tianjin People's Procuratorate (not present the first time), and myself personally. As the representative of the head office, I not only failed to stop this extravagant and wasteful behavior of the North China District Company during the inspection work, but also accepted the banquets, which was very wrong. In addition to publicly admitting my mistakes and making profound self-reflection, I also hope that the China Petroleum Company North China District Company will profoundly examine the motives behind repeatedly hosting banquets for inspection personnel.

    中国石油公司
    华北区公司应深刻检讨一再设宴招待检查人员的动机
    编辑同志：一九五一年十二月二十五日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了读者张振芳对中国石油公司华北区公司在仓库失火后设宴招待检查人员的批评。我没有参加这一事件，但在另一事件上却犯了同样性质的错误。一九五一年七月，我代表中国石油总公司参加了中央人民监察委员会组成的“检查小组”，到中国石油公司华北区公司检查一个案件。当开始检查时和检查结束后，中国石油公司华北区公司曾两度设宴招待所有检查人员，包括中央人民监察委员会、中央人民政府贸易部、天津市人民检察署（第一次不在）的代表和我个人。我作为总公司的代表，在检查工作时，对于华北区公司这种铺张浪费的行为，非但不加以阻止，而且接受了宴请，这是十分不对的。我除了公开承认错误和作深刻的反省外，并希望中国石油公司华北区公司深刻检讨这种一再设宴招待检查人员的动机。
