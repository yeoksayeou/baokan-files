Wuhan City State-owned, public and joint state-private enterprises have universally carried out asset inventory and capital verification work. Units under the Zhengzhou Railway Administration's Hankou Branch and the Hengyang Railway Administration's Wuchang Branch, Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Company, Jiji Hydroelectric Company, Universe Tobacco Factory, First Cotton Mill, Zhenhuan Cotton Mill, and other units have completed or are in the process of completing asset inventory work. The valuation work of individual units (such as Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Company) has also been completed; generally, they are awaiting the completion of asset valuation, plan formulation, capital verification and other next steps. City-run enterprises, such as the Quarry, Hydroelectric Products Factory, Engineering Company, Ice Factory, Ferry Company, Oil Factory, Paper Mill, Wuhan Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Wuhan Public Bus Company, Chemical Factory, Sawmill, Liqun Brick and Tile Factory, Printing Factory, Wuchang Machine Rice Mill and other units, have completed asset inventory and valuation work; some are undergoing review and valuation work. The Oil Factory, Paper Mill, and Dyeing and Weaving Factory have been slow in their work due to the failure to mobilize the masses and the failure of a few professional cadres to assume their due responsibilities. The Wuhan Capital Verification Committee has sent cadres to assist them.

    Roughly Figured Out the Assets, Initially Achieving a Clear Understanding

The above-mentioned units, except for the two joint state-private cotton mills, have undergone inventory work after being taken over, general surveys, and warehouse clearing campaigns, and have initially carried out warehouse clearing and registration work. However, in the past, leading cadres did not fully understand the importance of this work and lacked experience, so the inventory work was not thorough enough. This time, the asset inventory and capital verification work of various units in Wuhan City, although the degree of seriousness and intensity of the work varied, and the results differed, all achieved certain accomplishments. In this asset inventory, each unit roughly figured out its assets and initially achieved a clear understanding. In units where the masses were better mobilized, a large number of off-book materials were discovered, and the asset inventory work was done more thoroughly. The Jiang'an Machine Factory turned all obsolete and waste materials over once, clearing out more than 280 tons of useful materials; the Zhenhuan Cotton Mill cleared out 2,781 kinds of off-book materials, about 20,000 pieces. The Wuchang Branch's Engineering Section collected more than 1,900 steel rails, which can be used to lay more than ten kilometers of railway. After the asset inventory work, general units abolished small workshops' warehouses, sorted out the inventory of various machinery and materials, and achieved consistency between accounts and materials. For example, the Jiang'an Machine Factory and the Zhenhuan Cotton Mill returned all the accumulated materials in the workshop's small warehouses to the warehouse, where the storage department classified and sorted them, labeled them, put them on the books, managed them centrally, and issued materials by designated personnel, and strictly implemented the material return system at the end of the month. In order to consolidate the results, the Zhenhuan Cotton Mill is establishing a machinery and material receiving, dispatching, and storage management system, further strengthening the workshop's budget system, and establishing a reward and punishment system based on the comparison between the actual consumption of machinery and materials and the budget. Individual units that conducted asset inventory for the first time can also initially achieve a clear understanding. Employees in units with better asset inventory have initially established the concept of cherishing state property. After the asset inventory, the Wuchang Branch found that the value of accumulated materials in the locomotive section reached more than 2.4 billion yuan, while the actual need was only 200 million yuan, accumulating twelve times the state's funds. The staff was shocked. Workers reflected: "If the state takes away the funds we have accumulated, can't we add eleven more locomotive sections!" Some workers in the Wuchang Branch's Telegraph Section said: "In the past, we didn't work without materials, but now we have to calculate and use old materials." Some workers in the Inspection Section dug out things buried underground. Workers in the Jiang'an Machine Factory's Casting and Forging Sections only knew how to work and didn't ask about costs; now they actively suggest to the Production Planning Section: "Do not manufacture any parts that are already in the warehouse, so as to avoid accumulating working capital." Workers ask the administrator for the price when they receive materials. Under the condition of not affecting product quality, they try to use waste materials as much as possible. In addition, the workers completely sorted out the waste materials dismantled during vehicle repairs and handed them over to the warehouse, never throwing them away randomly. After the asset inventory, each unit initially distinguished between fixed assets and current assets. In the past, because the more complex fixed assets and current assets were not clearly distinguished, it affected cost calculation and asset management. This time, according to the clear regulations of the central government, they have been clearly divided; and the fixed assets have been divided into three categories: used, unused, and fundamentally unused, and registered separately. Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Company also strictly inspected the fundamentally unused fixed assets, and treated those with no repair value as scrap, and did not include them in the materials to be turned over, correcting the idea of "kicking them away" in last year's warehouse clearing campaign. The cadres participating in the asset inventory and capital verification work have initially established the idea of relying on the masses. In the past, many units' workers reflected that the staff did not go deep into the masses, but through this asset inventory work, the financial and technical personnel of some units worked together with the workers to study and cooperate, which not only enabled the meticulous and complex asset inventory work to be completed in a timely manner with the strong support of the masses, but also achieved mutual unity of employees in the work. For example, the deputy director of the Capital Verification Committee of Zhenhuan Cotton Mill (head of the accounting section) relied on the workers in his work, and the workers cleared tens of thousands of yarn tubes without missing one in less than two hours. Therefore, he said: "Relying on the masses is not only the key to doing a good job in asset inventory, but also the key to doing a good job in valuation, capital verification, cost management and other work in the future."

    Many Unit Leaders Have a Purely Task-Oriented View, and the Asset Inventory Is Not Thorough

Party and administrative responsible cadres of many enterprises in Wuhan City do not fully understand the importance of asset inventory and capital verification work. They have a purely task-oriented view and simplistic ideas, so that ideological leadership is not enough, and they have not launched ideological struggles to clear away various erroneous ideas that hinder the development of asset inventory and capital verification work; after simply studying among the cadres participating in asset inventory and capital verification work, they hastily entered the asset inventory work. Some units still have departmentalism ideas, fearing that too much will be turned over and the unit will not have enough, so they always want to keep more. For example, the Second Factory of Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Company estimated the price of retained assets lower, and estimated the price of assets to be turned over higher than it should be. Also, the manager of the Engineering Company was unwilling to estimate the price of houses according to the instruction of "complete replacement value," but wanted to deal with it according to his own book figures. Due to insufficient propaganda and education work, the workers also have ideological concerns and erroneous views such as "laying an ambush," "finding fault," "asset inventory is searching homes," and "reluctant to part with." In terms of organizing forces, the heads of each unit are mostly nominal in this work and do not truly take charge personally. They emphasize that they are busy with work and have not made up their minds to extract as many technical personnel, financial personnel, and old technical workers as possible to do this work, nor have they seriously carried out various preparatory work. Some units' responsible cadres do not fully understand that asset inventory and capital verification is a mass work. When carrying out this work, some units did not explain the reasons and methods to all employees, nor did they mobilize all workers, technicians and staff to jointly study and cooperate to complete the task. Therefore, in most enterprises in the city, only a few staff members were working, and the broad masses of employees were not mobilized. Hidden materials have not been fully excavated. The mass movement against waste has not been launched. The Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Company, because the masses' concerns about being held responsible have not been dispelled, the serious problem of lost tools has not been well resolved to this day. As a result, the asset inventory work is not thorough enough, and valuation is difficult to be accurate. Units that have completed asset inventory and capital verification work generally have not established several necessary systems immediately, such as material management and material receiving and returning system, registration and statistical system, etc., to consolidate the achievements of asset inventory and capital verification work. The asset inventory and capital verification work and the democratic reform movement of some units lack organic combination. A few units such as Hankou Branch, Wuchang Branch and Chemical Factory are better combined, made full preparations in advance, and mobilized the masses to work together in the gap between the two stages of democratic struggle and democratic unity. After receiving this task, some units did not combine it with democratic reform and other work, and did not have a general plan and unified arrangement. As a result, various tasks were either pushed forward or mutually restricted, making it impossible to complete asset inventory and capital verification work accurately and in a timely manner.

    武汉市国营公营和公私合营企业
    普遍进行清理资产核定资金工作
    有些单位领导干部忽视进行思想斗争和发动群众结果没有把这个工作做好或不能准确及时地完成
    武汉市国营、公营和公私合营企业，已普遍地进行清理资产核定资金工作。郑州铁路管理局汉口分局和衡阳铁路管理局武昌分局所属各单位，江汉船舶机械公司、既济水电公司、宇宙烟厂、第一纱厂、震寰纱厂等单位，都已经完成或正在进行清理资产工作。个别单位（如江汉船舶机械公司）的估价工作，也已经进行完毕；一般的正待完成资产估价、编制计划、核定资金等下一步工作。市营企业，如石料厂、水电制品厂、工程公司、制冰厂、轮渡公司、油厂、纸厂、武汉染织厂、武汉公用汽车公司、化工厂、锯木厂、利群砖瓦厂、印刷厂、武昌机器制米厂等单位，有的已经完成了清理资产和估价工作；有的正进行覆查、估价工作；油厂、纸厂、染织厂由于没有发动群众以及少数专业干部没有负起应有的责任，工作进行得很慢，武汉市核定资金委员会已派干部协助他们。
    大致摸清了家底，初步作到心中有数
    上面说到的各单位，除公私合营的两个纱厂外，都经过了接管后的清点工作、普查和清理仓库的运动，初步地进行过清理仓库和登记工作。但是，过去领导干部对这个工作的重要意义认识不足，又缺乏经验，清理工作都搞得不够彻底。这次武汉市各单位的清理资产核定资金工作，虽因进行工作认真紧张的程度不同，成绩有大小之分，但都有一定的成就。各单位在这次清理资产中，大致摸清了家底，初步作到了心中有数。在发动群众较好的单位，发现了大批的账外物资，清理资产工作做得比较彻底。江岸机厂把呆废材料全部翻了一次身，共清出二百八十多吨有用材料；震寰纱厂清理出来了二千七百八十一种账外物资，约有两万多件。武昌分局工务段收集了一千九百多根钢轨，可以铺设十几公里铁路。一般单位经过清理资产工作以后，废除了车间的小仓库，整理了库存的各种机物料，做到了账料一致。如江岸机厂、震寰纱厂把车间小仓库内的积料全部退库，由保管部门加以分类整理，挂牌上账，集中管理，专人发料，到月终严格执行退料制度。震寰纱厂为了巩固成果，正建立机物料收发保管制度，进一步加强车间的预算制度，在机物料实际耗用和预算比较之下，建立奖惩制度。个别初次进行清理资产的单位，也能初步做到心中有数。清理资产比较好的单位，职工初步树立了爱护国家财产的观念。武昌分局经过清理资产以后，发现机务段积压材料价值达二十四亿元以上，而实际只需二亿元就够了，积压了国家十二倍的资金。职工大吃一惊。工人这样反映：“要是国家把我们积压的资金拿去，不是又可添十一个机务段吗！”武昌分局电务段有的工人说：“过去没有材料就不干活，现在要打打算盘，利用旧的材料了。”检车段有些工人把埋藏在地下的东西都挖掘了出来。江岸机厂铸锻两场的工人，以前只知干活，不问成本；现在主动地向生产计划科建议：“凡是库房已有的配件，就不再制造，以免积压流动资金。”工人领料时，先向管理员问清价钱。在不影响产品质量的条件下，他们尽量利用废料。此外，工人们把修车时拆下来的废料，也完全整理交库，绝不乱扔了。各单位在清理资产之后，初步划清了固定资产和流动资产。过去由于没有把比较复杂的固定资产与流动资产划分清楚，影响成本计算和资产的管理。这一次根据中央明确规定，已划分清楚了；并将固定资产分为使用未使用和根本不使用三类分别登记起来。江汉船舶机械公司还严格地检验了根本不使用的固定资产，对其中无修复价值的即作废料处理，不列入上缴物资，纠正了去年清理仓库运动中“一脚踢开”的思想。参加清理资产核定资金工作的干部，初步树立了依靠群众的思想。过去，许多单位的工人反映职员不深入群众，但通过这次清理资产工作，有些单位的财务人员技术人员和工人一起，共同研究，通力合作，不但使细致复杂的清理资产工作在群众的大力支持下及时地完成了，而且在工作中做到了职工相互团结。如震寰纱厂核定资金委员会副主任委员（会计科长）在工作中依靠了工人群众，工人们把几万个纱管，不到两小时就一个不漏地清理好了。因此，他说：“依靠群众，不但是搞好清理资产工作的关键，也是今后搞好估价、核定资金、成本管理以及其它工作的关键。”
    许多单位领导干部有单纯任务观点，清理资产不彻底
    武汉市许多企业单位的党和行政负责干部对清理资产核定资金工作的重要意义认识不足。他们有单纯的任务观点和简单化的想法，以致思想领导不够，未能展开思想斗争，廓清足以妨碍清理资产核定资金工作开展的各种错误思想；只在参加清理资产核定资金工作的干部中简单地学习之后，就草率地进入了清理资产的工作。有些单位仍有本位主义思想，唯恐上缴的多了，本单位不够用，总想多留点。如江汉船舶机械公司第二厂把留用资产的价格估的低些，对上缴的资产则估的高于应有价格。又工程公司的经理，对房屋不愿依“重置完全价值”的指示估价，而要依自己的账面数字来处理。由于进行宣教工作不够，工人群众也有“打埋伏”“找岔子”“清产是抄家”和“舍不得”等思想顾虑和错误看法。在组织力量方面，各单位负责人在这个工作中多系挂名，没有真正负责地亲自掌握。他们强调工作忙，没有下决心尽量抽出一部分技术人员、财务人员和老技术工人专门做这个工作，也没有认真进行各项准备工作。有些单位的负责干部对清理资产核定资金是一个群众性的工作认识不足。某些单位在进行这一工作时，没有向全体职工说明道理，交代办法，也没有发动全体工人技术人员和职员共同研究通力合作来完成任务。因此，全市多数企业单位只是少数工作人员在动，广大职工群众没有动。隐藏物资没有充分被发掘出来。群众性的反浪费运动没有开展起来。江汉船舶机械公司，即因群众怕负责任的顾虑没有打消，丢失工具的严重问题，至今没有很好地解决。结果，清理资产工作做得不够彻底，估价也很难精确。已经完成清理资产、核定资金工作的单位，一般都没有紧接着建立几个必要的制度，如材料的管理和领料、退料制度，登记和统计制度等，以巩固清理资产核定资金工作的成绩。有些单位的清理资产核定资金工作和民主改革运动，缺乏有机的结合。汉口分局、武昌分局和化工厂等少数单位结合较好，事前作了充分准备，在民主斗争和民主团结两个阶段空隙中，发动群众大家动手。若干单位在接到这个任务之后，没有和民主改革及其它工作结合起来，没有通盘计划和统一安排，结果，各种工作不是互相推移，就是彼此牵制，使清理资产核定资金工作不能准确和及时地完成。（中共武汉市委通讯组）
