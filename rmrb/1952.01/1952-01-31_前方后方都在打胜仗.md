    The Front and the Rear Are Both Winning Victories
    Editor: January 24th was an unforgettable day. We only spent half a day with the "most beloved people," and we felt infinitely strengthened in our lives.
    When the student union asked us to be receptionists, we immediately became nervous. We finally got the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home, but we didn't know where to begin with all the words that filled our hearts.
    We accompanied them to visit various places in the school. Everywhere we went, we happily told them about the vivid examples created by the teachers, students, and staff in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement: Qin Fengzhi's precision large copper ball made with a broken lathe; the motorcycles repaired voluntarily by the workers of the Mechanical Engineering Department; how the students sewed cotton gloves with their own hands to send to the front lines... We also told them how the students formulated and revised patriotic pledges, and how they were carrying out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. A Volunteer Army comrade said, "We are winning victories on both the front and the rear!"
    We are proud to be with the heroes of the motherland, but we feel that our own contribution to the motherland is too small. We must learn from the heroic and hardworking spirit of the Volunteer Army comrades and train ourselves to be able to serve the motherland better.

### 前方后方都在打胜仗

    前方后方都在打胜仗
    编辑同志：一月二十四日是一个难忘的日子。我们和“最可爱的人”相处不过半天，就感到在生活中增加了无限的力量。
    当学生会要我们作招待员的时候，我们的心情立刻紧张起来。我们好容易把志愿军归国代表等来了，但是充满了心坎的话却不知从那里说起。
    我们陪同他们到学校各地参观。每到一处，我们都愉快地给他们讲述着全校师生员工在抗美援朝运动中所创造出来的生动事例：秦凤志用破车床制成的精密大铜球；机械系的工友们义务修复的摩托车；同学们如何用自己的手缝制了送往前线的棉手套……。我们还告诉他们：同学们怎样订立和修订爱国公约，怎样进行着反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动。一位志愿军同志说：“我们前后方都在打胜仗啊！”
    我们能和祖国的英雄们在一起感到骄傲，但又觉得我们自己对祖国的贡献太少了。我们一定要学习志愿军同志们英勇刻苦的精神，把自己锻炼得能更好地为祖国服务。丁祥麟　吴友华
