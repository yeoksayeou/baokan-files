Bureaucracy is a Breeding Ground for Corruption and Waste
Ou Haibin

The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's instructions on the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement and the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy state: "Bureaucracy is precisely the breeding ground for corruption and waste. Wherever corruption and waste are most serious, bureaucracy is bound to be most serious." Many facts have proven this assertion to be completely correct.

Some people always think that bureaucracy is better than corruption and waste. Some shamelessly say: "I have no shortcomings, except for a bit of bureaucracy." In fact, although bureaucracy and corruption and waste are different in nature, it is difficult to say which is "cleaner." In terms of the magnitude of harm to the interests of the country and the people, the poison of bureaucracy is often even more serious. This is because many corrupt acts are covered up or condoned by bureaucrats, and many wasteful acts are approved or advocated by bureaucrats. Bureaucracy is a place for harboring dirt and filth, a stagnant pool where a rotten atmosphere arises; many germs and vermin will grow from it, and flies will gather there from afar, smelling its scent.

In the "breeding ground" of bureaucracy, many corrupt individuals and wasters will grow. In Shandong Province's Department of Industry and the Construction Engineering Company, three or five leading cadres with bureaucratic styles have cultivated forty-two corrupt elements; the number of people engaged in wasteful behavior has not yet been calculated. The general manager said that a leading corrupt element in the company was "capable" and even wanted to promote him to deputy section chief. As a result, within two years of the company's establishment, corruption and waste incidents occurred one after another, causing nearly 7.2 billion yuan in state property losses; accidents occurred one after another in the projects, killing and injuring seventy workers. Cutting corners, rework waste, collusion with unscrupulous merchants, engaging in private fraud, accepting bribes, covering up tax evasion, speculation, hoarding, extravagance and waste—all kinds of terrible things happened one after another in this company. For example, in Changzhou City, Southern Jiangsu, after liberation, the tax officials initially did not dare to be corrupt. Later, the corrupt official Zhou Qian saw that the leadership, from the municipal government and the tax bureau to the tax office, had a bureaucratic style, so he said to his accomplices: "Now we can move!" Thus, a collective corruption case occurred. Corrupt elements "move" only after they have identified the weaknesses of bureaucrats.

Bureaucracy has even greater poison; it makes leading cadres politically blind and confused, losing their sense of awareness. Like the leaders of the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company, they even brought some special agents and counter-revolutionary criminals with blood debts into the company to serve as section chiefs and staff members. This situation is not unique to this company; it exists in many other units. Bureaucracy is a product of the exploiting classes; those who are tainted with bureaucracy unknowingly become prisoners of the reactionary exploiting classes in their thinking, and actually serve the exploiting classes.

The severity of the poison of bureaucracy also lies in its contagiousness. It will cultivate more bureaucrats, and then they will "protect each other," depending on each other for survival. For example, the bureaucracy of the leading cadres of the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company is closely related to the bureaucracy of the leading cadres of the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry; and the bureaucracy of the company's leading cadres has also spread to the various sections and offices under its jurisdiction. The responsible cadres of the East China Branch of the National Materials Inventory and Allocation Committee are high above and do not go deep into the lower levels, thus condoning and fueling the bureaucratic style of the responsible cadres of the First Warehouse under their jurisdiction, causing large quantities of materials to become moldy and stolen, resulting in huge losses to state property.

Bureaucracy is very dangerous to the revolution. As Stalin said in 1930 in "Political Report and Conclusion of the Central Committee to the 16th Congress of the CPSU(B)": "Not only are the old bureaucrats who have burrowed into our organs dangerous, but the new bureaucrats, the Soviet bureaucrats, are also dangerous, and even more dangerous than the old bureaucrats." Especially because most bureaucrats are in positions of power, the harm is even more serious. The masses follow them, but their eyes are closed. Stalin also said in 1933 in "Summary of the First Five-Year Plan": "Many of our comrades tolerate this phenomenon, not understanding the meaning and significance of these facts of large-scale theft and encroachment on public property. They seem to be blind, unable to see these facts, thinking that 'there is nothing particularly serious here'." They did not prevent these serious events in advance, nor did they take effective measures to correct them afterward. The state and the people entrusted them with important tasks, asking them to serve the people well, but they considered themselves "bureaucratic masters." They turned the revolutionary organs into lifeless and foul-smelling bureaucratic yamen. They caused huge economic losses to the state and the people, and incalculable political losses to the Party and the government; they ruined many cadres and prevented the growth of new cadres; they suppressed the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. We should shout loudly to these people with what Stalin said after saying the above: You are "greatly mistaken"!

Bureaucrats often blindly pride themselves on being "clean"; let us see what their image is like!

Some bureaucrats are muddle-headed and hedonistic, that is, the "bureaucrats who eat their fill all day long and have no use for their minds," as everyone often says. Such bureaucrats are easily discovered. However, people with this problem are not aware of it. They are muddle-headed, getting by, free, and satisfied. Some bureaucrats are busy with official documents and stamping seals, but these people entrust even official documents and seals to others to handle. They are thus muddle-headedly allowing large amounts of state wealth to be stolen and damaged by corrupt individuals and wasters.

Some bureaucrats are pragmatists. Their "hands and feet are busy, but their brains are resting"; they seem to be very "busy" every day, but they don't know what they have done. This is what everyone often calls "hard-working bureaucrats." They are busy everywhere, struggling to deal with trivial matters coming from all directions. Their work has no focus, no plan, dealing with whatever comes their way, changing orders from morning to evening, leaving their subordinates at a loss. "The upper level changes a lot, the middle level forwards it as is, and the lower level is in trouble." "The upper level has many heads and minds, the middle level has no head and no mind, and the lower level is muddle-headed." Thus, they also give corrupt individuals and wasters opportunities to take advantage.

Such bureaucrats are often also red tape-loving, some of whom are what everyone often calls "empty talkers." They like to talk emptily about policies, principles, plans, and resolutions, but are unwilling to delve into practical work. Their organs are overstaffed, with many people sitting in offices drafting official documents, regulations, measures, and instructions. These "products" of theirs are not investigated and studied before being decided, and no inspection is carried out after they are announced. They only forward the important instructions from the higher levels, making them forever empty words on paper. They constantly urge the lower levels to submit reports and forms, with large piles of official documents on their desks, which can never be processed, becoming a heavy burden. In order to process these official documents more quickly, they hurriedly and carelessly stamp and approve them; thus, many corrupt and wasteful acts are "approved."

No matter what kind of bureaucrat, they are all detached from the masses, detached from the organization, detached from reality, and detached from politics. This is the most basic characteristic of bureaucrats. For example, the workers of the First Warehouse of the East China Branch of the National Materials Inventory and Allocation Committee repeatedly made suggestions to the leadership about rescuing materials that were about to become moldy, but the leadership turned a deaf ear and ignored them completely. Many staff members of the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company had long put forward positive opinions on the corruption and waste phenomena in the company, but the leading cadres ignored them, saying: "You don't have to worry about it, I'll take responsibility!" When the masses exposed them in the newspaper, they scolded "unorganized, undisciplined," "must find out who wrote the manuscript!" They even wanted to transfer away the cadres who made suggestions. The leading cadres of the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry did not discuss anything with the Party committee, and the leading cadres of the Construction Engineering Company even regarded the Party organization in the organ as an "appendage" that they could use at will. Bureaucrats thus separate the administrative aspect from the Party organization, and separate the administrative aspect, the Party organization, and the masses; a few leading cadres are high above, isolated and closed off. This environment is naturally very suitable for corrupt individuals, wasters, and bureaucrats, but it will cause incalculable harm to the Party and the people.

Why does bureaucracy arise in the revolutionary ranks? As Chairman Mao said, bureaucracy and corruption and waste are both "filth and poison left over from the old society." In a class society, the revolutionary ranks are constantly invaded by various non-proletarian ideological styles; bureaucracy is one of the most corrosive of these ideological styles. Some people in the revolutionary ranks who are detached from the masses and have not firmly grasped the weapon of criticism and self-criticism find it difficult to resist its invasion. Especially in recent years, we have taken over some bureaucratic enterprises and bureaucratic organs of the Kuomintang, and have been affected to varying degrees by some remaining bureaucratic systems and styles. After bureaucracy invades the revolutionary ranks, it then colludes from within and without, opening the door for corruption and waste.

To eliminate corruption and waste, we must simultaneously overthrow bureaucracy and open fire in three directions. If bureaucracy is not overthrown, the phenomena of corruption, extravagance, and waste will never be completely eliminated.

How can bureaucracy be overthrown?

Stalin said: "In the struggle against bureaucracy, the work of the Party proceeds in four directions: developing self-criticism, examining the degree of implementation of various tasks, purging the organs, and promoting loyal staff members from the working class from below into the organs." ("Political Report and Conclusion of the Central Committee to the 16th Congress of the CPSU(B)") This is also applicable to our current anti-bureaucracy struggle.

Since bureaucracy in the revolutionary ranks has caused great losses to the state and the people, leading cadres with this problem must first conduct open, strict, serious, and thorough self-criticism. Dig out the roots of their illness, propose improvement methods and guarantees, and let the masses supervise their earnest correction.

"Examining the degree of implementation of various tasks" means implementing work inspection. As Stalin said, a well-organized work inspection is like a searchlight; it will make bureaucrats have nowhere to hide. In addition to inspections by higher levels, leaders of each unit must personally preside over them, combining self-criticism, mobilizing the masses, and bravely inspecting the work of their own unit. Some leading cadres even find the two words "inspection" annoying, thinking that inspecting the work of their unit damages their "face"; some people even find excuses to go out to avoid it when their unit is being inspected, saying "out of sight, out of mind". This behavior of treating the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle with a bureaucratic attitude is adding sin to sin, which our Party, government, and the masses of the people can never tolerate. Bureaucrats are afraid of inspection, which shows that inspection is indeed a good way to cure bureaucracy.

To overcome bureaucracy, it is also necessary to strictly and resolutely implement the discipline of the Party and the state. If a major act of corruption and waste occurs in a unit, the responsible cadres of that unit should be considered derelict of duty and should be subject to due punishment. Those昏庸腐朽bureaucratic elements and derelict elements should be removed from their leadership positions. As Stalin said: We must "expose incorrigible bureaucrats and formalists and expel them from the administrative organs." "These arrogant dignitaries think they are irreplaceable and that they can violate the resolutions of the leading organs at will without being punished. How should such staff members be treated? They should be removed from their leadership positions without hesitation, no matter what merits they have had in the past. They should be replaced, demoted, and this matter should be published in the newspapers." ("Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) at the 17th Party Congress") In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, many places have already done this, removing or suspending incorrigible bureaucratic elements, which has been warmly supported by the masses.

Since bureaucrats are detached from the masses, to eradicate the bureaucratic style, we must break down all barriers and bring bureaucrats face to face with the masses. In addition to self-criticism being conducted among the masses, we must also fully promote democracy, ensure that the masses have the freedom to criticize bureaucrats, and allow the masses to launch merciless attacks on bureaucracy. The Party organization must constantly improve the political awareness of the masses, guide the broad masses to dare to make criticisms and suggestions to any leading organs and leading cadres; and ensure that the correct opinions of the masses can be accepted by the leading organs and leading cadres. We must establish a democratic system and cultivate normal democratic living habits. We must conduct anti-bureaucracy education among the broad masses of cadres and the masses, so that everyone can be vigilant about the harm of bureaucracy and recognize the shamefulness of bureaucracy. After the broad masses of cadres and the masses hate bureaucracy and form mass supervision, the territory of bureaucrats will naturally be greatly reduced, and even eliminated.

The mass anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle is unfolding, and any fortifications of bureaucrats will eventually be completely destroyed. We will certainly be able to realize Chairman Mao's great call and achieve a complete victory in this struggle, "washing away these filth and poison left over from the old society!"

    官僚主义是贪污浪费的温床
    欧海滨
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会关于增产节约运动与反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的指示中说：“官僚主义正是贪污与浪费的温床，凡是贪污浪费最严重的地方，必然是官僚主义最严重的地方。”许多事实都证明了这个论断是完全正确的。
    有些人总认为官僚主义比贪污浪费要好一些。有人不以为耻地说：“我什么缺点也没有，就是有点官僚主义。”其实，官僚主义和贪污、浪费虽然性质各有不同，但是很难说那个更“干净”一些。就危害国家、人民利益的大小来说，官僚主义的毒害往往还更要严重一些。因为，许多贪污行为是官僚主义者掩护或纵容的，许多浪费行为是官僚主义者批准或倡导的。官僚主义是藏垢纳污之所，是发生腐烂气息的死水坑；许多病菌毒虫都会从它里面生长出来，苍蝇远远嗅到它的气息就都聚拢到它那里去。
    在官僚主义的“温床”上，会生长出许多贪污者、浪费者。山东省工业厅和建筑工程公司，有三、五个有官僚主义作风的领导干部，就培育出四十二个贪污分子；有浪费行为的人还没有计算。总经理说公司里的一个为首的贪污分子“能干”，竟要把他提拔为副科长。因此，这个公司成立后两年内，连续发生贪污浪费事件，使国家财产损失近七十二亿元；在工程中接连发生事故，死伤工人七十名。偷工减料，返工浪费、勾结奸商、营私舞弊、贪污受贿、包庇漏税、投机取巧、囤积居奇、铺张浪费，什么恶劣的事情都在这个公司里接二连三地发生了。又如：苏南常州市解放之后，最初税务人员是不敢贪污的。后来，贪污犯周谦看到从市政府、税务局到税务所的领导方面都有官僚主义作风，就对他的同伙说：“现在我们可以动了！”于是，就发生了集体贪污案。贪污分子就是这样看准了官僚主义者的弱点之后才“动”起来的。
    官僚主义还有更大的毒害，它使领导干部在政治上盲目胡涂，失去知觉。像山东省建筑工程公司的领导者，甚至把一些特务分子、有血债的反革命罪犯弄到公司里当了科长、科员。这种情形不只这一个公司有，其他单位也不少。官僚主义是剥削阶级的产物；沾染了官僚主义的人，就不知不觉地在思想上做了反动剥削阶级的俘虏，实际上为剥削阶级服务了。
    官僚主义的毒害的严重性，还在于它是有传染性的。它会培育出更多的官僚主义者，而后又“官官相卫”，相依为命。如：山东省建筑工程公司领导干部的官僚主义，和山东省工业厅领导干部的官僚主义是有密切关系的；而公司领导干部的官僚主义，也传染到了所属各科、室。全国物资清理调配委员会华东分会的负责干部高高在上，不深入下层，也就纵容了、助长了所属第一仓库负责干部的官僚主义作风，使大批物资霉烂，被盗窃，使国家资财遭受了巨大的损失。
    官僚主义对于革命是很危险的。正如斯大林一九三○年在“联共（布）第十六次大会上中央委员会的政治报告与结论”中所说的：“不仅那些钻在我们机关中的旧官僚是有危险的，而新的官僚分子、苏维埃的官僚分子也是危险的，并且比旧官僚更危险。”特别是因为官僚主义者大多数是处在有权力的地位，为害就更严重了。群众是跟着他们走路的，而他们的眼睛却是闭着的。斯大林一九三三年在“第一个五年计划的总结”中也说过：“我们有许多同志竟宽容这种现象，不懂得这种大批偷窃侵吞公产的事实的意思和意义。他们好像瞎子一样，看不见这些事实，以为‘这里并没有什么特别了不得的事’。”他们对这些严重的事件，事先既没有预防，事后也不采取有效的措施加以纠正。国家和人民付托他们以重任，要他们好好为人民服务，他们却自居为“官僚老爷”。他们把革命的机关，弄成死气沉沉乌烟瘴气的官僚衙门。他们给国家人民造成了巨大的经济损失，给党和政府造成了无可计量的政治损失；他们断送了许多干部，而且阻止了新干部的生长；他们压制了群众的积极性和创造性。应该用斯大林说了上面那句话以后接着说的话向这些人大喊一声：你们是“大错而特错了”！
    官僚主义者常常盲目地以自己身上“干净”而自豪；我们就来看看他们的形象到底是怎样的吧！
    有的官僚主义者是混世主义者和享乐主义者，也就是大家常说的“饱食终日无所用心的官僚主义者”。这种官僚主义者是很容易被人发现的。可是，有这种毛病的人，却并不自觉。他们昏昏沉沉，得过且过，自由自在，心满意足。有些官僚主义者忙于办公文，盖图章，而这种人却是连公文、图章都交给别人来办。他们就是这样昏昏沉沉地使大量的国家财富被贪污浪费者盗窃、损害了。
    有的官僚主义者是事务主义者。他们“手脚忙乱，头脑休息”；每天都似乎很“忙”，却不知道做了些什么。这就是大家常说的“辛辛苦苦的官僚主义者”。他们到处奔忙，苦于招架四面八方逼来的琐碎事务。工作没有重心，没有计划，碰到什么办什么，朝令夕改，使下级无所适从。“上层多变，中层照转，下层麻烦。”“上层多头多脑，中层无头无脑，下层混头混脑。”这样，也就使贪污者浪费者钻了空子。
    这种官僚主义者常常又是文牍主义者，其中有些也就是大家常说的“空谈家”。他们喜欢空谈方针、原则、计划、决议，而不肯深入实际工作。他们的机关里人浮于事，许多人坐在办公室里起草公文、条例、办法、指示。他们的这些“产品”，决定之前不调查研究，宣布之后不进行检查。他们收到上级的重要指示只是照转，使之永远成为纸上的空话。他们不断向下级催报告、催表报，办公桌上放着大堆大堆的公文，永远处理不完，成为沉重的包袱。为了快些处理这些公文，就急急忙忙马马虎虎地盖章、批准；于是，许多贪污浪费行为就这样被“批准”了。
    不论那种官僚主义者，都是脱离群众、脱离组织、脱离实际、脱离政治的。这是官僚主义者最基本的特点。如全国物资清理调配委员会华东分会第一仓库的工人群众屡次向领导方面提出关于抢救快要霉烂了的物资的建议，领导方面却不闻不问，概不理睬。山东省建筑工程公司不少工作人员早就对公司里的贪污浪费现象提出了积极的意见，可是，领导干部置之不理，说：“你们不要管，由我负责！”群众在报纸上揭发，他们就大骂“无组织，无纪律”，“非把写稿的人查出来不可！”甚至要把提意见的干部调走。山东省工业厅的领导干部什么事也不和党委商讨，建筑工程公司的领导干部甚至把机关里的党组织看作自己可以随便支使的“附属品”。官僚主义者就是这样使行政方面和党组织脱离，使行政方面、党组织和群众脱离；少数领导干部高高在上，孤立起来，闭塞起来。这种环境对贪污浪费者和官僚主义者来说自然是非常适宜的，但对党对人民就会造成无可计量的损害。
    为什么在革命队伍中会产生官僚主义呢？正如毛主席说的，官僚主义和贪污浪费同是“旧社会遗留下来的污毒”。在阶级社会里，革命队伍不断受着各种非无产阶级的思想作风的侵袭；官僚主义就是这些思想作风中特别具有腐蚀性的一种。革命队伍中有些脱离群众和没有紧紧掌握住批评与自我批评的武器的人，就很难抵御它的侵袭。尤其是近几年，我们接收了国民党的一些官僚企业、官僚机关，也多少不等地连带着受了一些残留的官僚主义的制度和作风的影响。官僚主义侵入革命队伍之后，就又里应外合，为贪污浪费打开了方便之门。
    要肃清贪污浪费现象，必须同时打倒官僚主义，向三方面一齐开火。如果官僚主义不被打倒，贪污腐化、铺张浪费的现象就永远不会消灭干净。
    怎样才能打倒官僚主义呢？
    斯大林说：“在反对官僚主义的斗争中，党的工作向四方面进行：发展自我批评，审查各种工作执行的程度，清洗机关，从工人阶级中自下提拔忠实的工作人员到机关中去。”（“联共（布）第十六次大会上中央委员会的政治报告与结论”）这对于我们现在进行的反官僚主义斗争也是适用的。
    革命队伍中的官僚主义给国家人民造成了很大的损失，那么，有这种毛病的领导干部，就必须首先进行公开的严格的认真的彻底的自我批评。把自己的病根挖去，提出改进的办法和保证，让群众监督自己切实改正。
    “审查各种工作执行的程度”，也就是实行工作检查。正如斯大林说过的，组织得好的工作检查，就像探照灯一样；它会把官僚主义者照得无处容身。除了由上级进行检查之外，各单位的领导者必须亲自主持，结合自我批评，发动群众，勇敢地对本单位的工作进行检查。有的领导干部连“检查”这两个字都觉得讨厌，认为检查他的单位的工作有损他的
    “面子”；有的人在检查他的单位时竟找藉口外出躲
    避，说什么“眼不见，心不烦”。这种以官僚主义
    的态度对待反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的行为，是罪上加罪的，是我们的党、政府和人民群众决不能容许的。官僚主义者害怕检查，正说明了检查确
    是治官僚主义的一个好办法。
    要克服官僚主义，还必须严格地坚决地执行党和国家的纪律。那个单位发生了重大的贪污浪费行为，那个单位的负责干部就应当被认为是渎职分子，就应该受到应有的处罚。应把那些昏庸腐朽的官僚主义分子和失职分子从领导岗位上撤下来。正如斯大林所说的：必须“揭破不可救药的官僚主义者和形式主义者，把它们逐出管理机关”。“这些妄自尊大的显贵以为他们是无可替换的人物，以为他们能随便违背领导机关决议而不受到处分。应当怎样处置这种工作人员呢？应当毫无迟疑地撤销他们的领导职务，不管他们过去有过怎样的功劳。应当撤换他们，降低他们的职位，并把此事在报章上公布出来。”（“在第十七次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”）在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中，不少地方已经这样作了，把若干不可救药的官僚主义分子撤销职务或停止工作，这样做受到了群众的热烈拥护。
    官僚主义者既然是脱离群众的，我们要根除官僚主义作风，就必须打破一切隔阂，使官僚主义者和群众直接见面。除了自我批评要在群众中进行，还要充分发扬民主，保证群众有对官僚主义者提出批评的自由，允许群众对官僚主义作无情的进攻。党组织要不断提高群众的政治觉悟，引导广大群众敢于对任何领导机关和领导干部提出批评和建议；并保证群众的正确意见能为领导机关和领导干部接受。要建立民主制度，培养正常的民主生活习惯。要在广大干部和群众中进行反官僚主义的教育，使大家都能警惕官僚主义的危害性，认识官僚主义的可耻。广大干部和群众痛恨官僚主义，形成群众性的监督之后，官僚主义者的地盘自然就会大大缩小，以至消灭。
    群众性的反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争正在展开，官僚主义者的任何防御工事终必被完全摧毁。我们一定能够实现毛主席的伟大号召，取得这个斗争的完全胜利，“将这些旧社会遗留下来的污毒洗干净！”
