Wang Yongzhang and his "Special Merit Platoon"

During the fifth campaign in the Korean battlefield, the second platoon of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army was tasked with the arduous mission of intercepting the enemy. Platoon leader Wang Yongzhang was deploying the battle when an enemy tank sped over from the north. At his command, machine guns and rifles fired at the tank, but it didn't hit a vital spot and got away. Platoon leader Wang Yongzhang told everyone to immediately prepare anti-tank weapons. No sooner had he spoken than the enemy's second tank came rushing over, with more than twenty British devils clinging to it, firing their machine guns blindly in all directions. Wang Yongzhang said to Zhao Ziyu and Zhang Qiuchang: "You two take care of this tank, don't let it get away!" The platoon leader's order struck a chord with them. As the tank slowed down at a bend one hundred meters away from them, they quickly circled around and threw two anti-tank mines at it from the side, causing the tank to explode in flames. At this moment, an armored vehicle came down the road. Wang Yongzhang shouted, "Fire!" and a hail of grenades were thrown at it, immediately knocking the armored vehicle onto the burning tank, also setting it ablaze. In the blink of an eye, another tank came over. Wang Yongzhang yelled, "Who will earn the great merit for this one!" Zhao Ziyu responded and ran out, followed closely by Wang Zhifu. They used only one anti-tank mine to finish it off. As the fourth tank crawled up, Youth League member Zhang Chaogui leaped onto the tank and, with a quick movement, planted an anti-tank mine. With a "boom," the tank burst into flames, and he himself suffered more than a dozen injuries. The fifth, sixth, and seventh tanks also crawled over, but in the face of the steel warriors under Wang Yongzhang's command, some were destroyed and others had no choice but to surrender. In this battle, a total of six enemy tanks, one armored vehicle, and four cars were destroyed, and more than one hundred enemies were eliminated. Six comrades performed great deeds, and the entire platoon was rated as the "Special Merit Platoon."

In the Tieyuan blocking action, the "Special Merit Platoon" won the glorious title of "Eight Heroes." In the defensive battle in a certain place last November, they continuously repelled eight frantic enemy attacks, annihilating 107 enemies. When people mention Wang Yongzhang's "Special Merit Platoon," they all say: "The soldiers in this platoon are all like little tigers!" (Attached picture)

    王永章和他的“特功排”
    在朝鲜战场第五次战役中，志愿军某部二排担任着截击敌人的艰巨任务。排长王永章正在布置战斗，敌人的一辆坦克从北面奔驰过来。他一声口号，机枪、步枪便对准坦克齐发，但没打中要害跑掉了。排长王永章让大家马上准备好反坦克武器。话刚说完，敌人的第二辆坦克又跑了过来，上面爬着二十多个英国鬼子，用机枪向四处盲目扫射。王永章向赵子玉、张秋昌说：“这辆坦克，你们俩打，绝不能叫它跑掉！”排长的命令正说中了他俩的心坎。坦克在距他们一百公尺一个拐弯处时，行速缓慢了，他们疾速绕过去，从侧面抛出两个反坦克雷，坦克上随即炸得冒起火烟。这时，路上又来了一辆装甲车。王永章大喊一声“打！”一群手榴弹随声扔上去，这辆装甲车立刻倒在正在冒烟的坦克上，也燃烧起来。一眨眼的功夫，又一辆坦克过来了。王永章大叫：“这个大功谁立！”赵子玉应声跑了出去，王志福也紧跟着跑上去。他们只用了一个反坦克雷，便把它结果了。当第四辆坦克紧接着爬过来时，青年团员张朝贵一跃身跳在坦克上，顺手一个反坦克雷，“轰隆”一声，坦克便起了火，他自己的身上也受了十几处伤。第五辆、第六辆、第七辆也爬过来了，但在王永章指挥下的钢铁战士面前，有的被打坏有的只好投降。这次战斗，总计打毁敌人坦克六辆、装甲车一辆、汽车四辆，消灭敌人一百余名。六个同志立了大功，全排被评为“特功排”。
    “特功排”在铁原阻击战中，又获得“八勇士”的光荣称号，在去年十一月某地的防御战中，他们曾连续击败了敌人八次疯狂进攻，歼灭敌人一百零七名。人们一提起王永章“特功排”，都说：“这个排的战士，个个都像个小老虎！”（附图片）
