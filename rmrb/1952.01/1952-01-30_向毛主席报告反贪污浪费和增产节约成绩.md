    Reporting to Chairman Mao on Achievements in Anti-Corruption, Waste Reduction, Increased Production, and Thrift
    In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, we have eliminated corrupt elements, and our meals have improved.
    Respected Chairman Mao: I am a student in the third grade of junior high school at Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School. Since the liberation of Beijing, we have immediately received excellent learning conditions, and because you are very concerned about our health, our meals have also improved. Before liberation, we ate cornbread and drank plain boiled water; after liberation, we could often eat meat dishes, rice, or steamed buns. We deeply realize how fortunate we are to live in the Mao Zedong era!
    However, after some time, our meals gradually deteriorated again. Cornbread replaced steamed buns, sorghum rice replaced white rice, and dried radish replaced pork dishes. Students felt sore legs and blurred vision during morning exercises, and they fell behind after running a few steps. Why did our meals become so bad again?
    Dear Chairman Mao, now I know the reason why our meals deteriorated. I'm telling you, it turns out that Ye Changchun, the food administrator of our meal group, was a corrupt element. He stole our rice and mixed sand into it, he took our sesame oil and replaced it with rancid oil.
    Dear Chairman Mao, you care about us from the bottom of your heart, hoping that we will grow up quickly and participate in the construction of our motherland; however, those corrupt elements are sucking our blood and marrow. They are so black-hearted. We deeply hate the bourgeois idea of harming others to benefit oneself. Now that we manage the food ourselves, our meals have immediately improved again. When we walked into the dining hall, the students exclaimed from the bottom of their hearts: "Comrades, let's write a letter to Chairman Mao and tell him that our meal group has eliminated corrupt elements and the meals have been taken care of!"
    Dear Chairman Mao, we deeply experience the brilliance and greatness of your leadership. I now assure you that I will continue to actively participate in this movement under your leadership and strive for greater victories! Sincerely, Jia Fengxian, student of Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School
    Letter to Chairman Mao from Workers of the Northeast State-Owned No. 3 Paper Mill
    Respected Chairman Mao: We, with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, have actively responded to your great call. At the end of November 1951, we gloriously overfulfilled the task of increasing production and saving 200,389 tons of grain (the task assigned to us by the state was 196,699 tons). On December 14, we completed the task assigned by the state 17 days ahead of schedule and exceeded it by 23 tons and 699 kilograms of grain. In this movement, we began to overcome various incorrect ideas, clearly recognized the important significance of increasing production and practicing thrift, and thus widely launched a labor emulation movement. In the emulation movement, we improved quality and strengthened production management.
    At present, the quality of our products is not good enough, and the operating procedures have not been well implemented. Therefore, we will never be satisfied with the existing achievements, and we will work harder to produce and deeply carry out the emulation movement to strive to complete the new glorious task for 1952.
    All workers of the Northeast Industrial Department State-Owned No. 3 Paper Mill

### 向毛主席报告反贪污浪费和增产节约成绩

    向毛主席报告反贪污浪费和增产节约成绩
    遵照毛主席的指示清除了贪污分子，我们的伙食改善了
    敬爱的毛主席：我是北京市第一女子中学初中三年级学生。自从北京解放以后，我们立即得到了很好的学习条件，并且，因为您十分关心我们的健康，我们的伙食也改善了。我们解放以前，吃窝头、喝白开水；解放后经常能吃肉菜、大米或馒头了。我们深深体会到我们生活在毛泽东时代是多么幸福！
    但是过了一些日子，我们的伙食又渐渐坏起来了，窝头代替了馒头，高粱米饭代替了大米饭，干萝卜菜代替了猪肉菜。同学们上早操腿发酸，眼发黑，跑上几步就掉队。我们的伙食为什么又这样坏起来了呢？
    亲爱的毛主席，现在我知道我们的伙食变坏的原因了。我告诉您，原来我们饭团的伙食管理员叶长春是个贪污分子。他把我们的大米偷走，又掺进了砂子，他把我们的香油拿走，换上了臭油。
    亲爱的毛主席，您从心里关心我们，希望我们很快长大，参加祖国的建设工作；但是，那些贪污分子却在敲我们的骨吸我们的髓。他们就是这样黑心。我们深深痛恨资产阶级这种损人利己的思想。现在伙食由我们自己管理起来了，我们的伙食马上又好起来了。当我们一走进饭堂的时候，同学们由衷地喊道：“同学们，咱们写信给毛主席罢，告诉他，我们的饭团已扫除了贪污分子，伙食已经办好了！”
    亲爱的毛主席，我们深深体验到了您的领导的英明伟大，我现在向您保证：我一定在您的领导下继续积极参加这个运动，争取更大的胜利！　　　北京市立第一女子中学学生　嘉凤仙
    东北国营第三造纸厂职工给毛主席的信
    敬爱的毛主席：我们以高度的爱国热情，积极地响应了您的伟大的号召。一九五一年十一月底，我们光荣地超额完成了增产节约二十万零三千五百八十九吨粮食的任务（国家交给我们的任务为十九万六千六百九十九吨）。十二月十四日，我们又提前十七天，完成了国家交付的任务，并超过二十三吨六百九十九公斤粮食。在这次运动中，我们开始克服了各种不正确的思想，明确地认识了增产节约的重要意义，因而广泛地展开了劳动竞赛运动。在竞赛运动中，提高了质量，加强了生产管理工作。
    现在，我们的产品质量还不够好，操作规程还没有很好地贯彻。因此，我们决不满足于现有的成绩，还要加倍地努力生产，深入开展竞赛运动，为完成一九五二年新的光荣任务而奋斗。
