    Remold Ideology and Strive to Implement Chairman Mao's Literary and Art Line!
    Cai Chusheng

    I
    I officially started working in the film industry in 1927. During the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, I witnessed the deepening national crisis and the treacherous reactionary rulers plunging the nation into misery and extreme hardship. At the same time, having initially accepted revolutionary theories and influenced by Soviet cinema, my works began to change their style. From then until I came to liberated Beijing in May 1949, I worked in the film industry in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and Hong Kong, and also wrote a stage play in Guilin.
    Those works were produced under the reactionary rule and the direct and indirect oppression of imperialism. What we were doing was a kind of open "legal struggle." Moreover, due to the limitations of the art form of film, our works had to be "commodities" and could only reach the masses through commercial relationships. This inherently subjected our works to great limitations and serious damage in terms of content and form. I do not want to hide the shortcomings of those works; I am stating the facts. I am also only talking about my personal works, not about other works of the same era. Those works did play a certain assisting role in the revolution in that specific era and environment, but I will not discuss that today. What I want to talk about here is whether I had done as well as possible under the limitations of that era and environment, whether I could have done better, and whether I had made sufficient efforts subjectively. My answer is no. I had not done as well as possible, I had failed to do better to the best of my ability, and I had not made sufficient efforts subjectively, but had serious shortcomings.
    Now let's examine these.
    Although I accepted revolutionary theories and the influence of Soviet cinema, and these influences played a guiding role in my creative career, my understanding was still very superficial, and I read very few books. After all, I was a petty-bourgeois intellectual who had not directly participated in revolutionary work. My political level was low, and my intellectual level was also low. Therefore, my works showed many serious shortcomings.
    First, regarding my creative ideology. I told myself that I wanted to make revolution, that I wanted to use the weapon of film to write for the broad masses (actually, it was limited to urban citizens, students, and intellectuals), that my works should start from class, that I should write about class struggle, that I should write about the laboring people and all the insulted and injured with the greatest enthusiasm, and that I should write about the reactionary rulers and all oppressors with the greatest hatred. However, my thoughts and feelings did not cross the boundaries of the petty bourgeoisie. I was influenced by bourgeois ideology and also by some feudal ideas. I could only use the petty-bourgeois worldview, outlook on life, and artistic views to engage in creation. That is to say, although I thought I loved the laboring people, in reality, I could only achieve "sympathy" and could not engage in creation with the proletarian attitude of "master of the house." Therefore, the ideological consciousness expressed in my works was very chaotic and often contradictory: sometimes putting the proletariat in the first place in leading the revolution (naturally, I could not write it well), sometimes lowering it to subordination to the leadership of the petty bourgeoisie; sometimes vaguely giving people a bright prospect, sometimes making people feel serious pessimism and disappointment; sometimes writing about the storms of struggle, sometimes simply chanting about the wind and moon; sometimes trying hard to describe the patriotic, truth-loving, and revolution-loving enthusiasm of the broad masses of people, sometimes ignorantly confusing the activities of reactionary elements with the revolutionary work of the people; sometimes appearing very simple and serious, sometimes claiming to be "bold," but in fact writing very vulgar things, simply promoting the bourgeois stuff; sometimes writing a little about new moral and ethical views, but more often writing about "sympathy," "humanity," and so-called "human nature"... In short, what runs through all my works is a petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness, using petty-bourgeois preferences and its free and undisciplined emotions and one-sidedness of thought methods to observe society and observe life. This gives the work a fundamental flaw. Therefore, it belongs to the category of revolutionary petty-bourgeoisie, not to the category of proletarian revolutionary literature and art. Although it played some role in that specific era and environment, it always seemed so unhealthy and sometimes even harmful.
    Second, creative methods. Apart from my early secluded rural life and apprenticeship in small cities, and later life in big cities, the range of life I came into contact with was very narrow, which showed a serious detachment from politics, life, the masses, and struggle. Furthermore, there were the American films that flooded the Chinese film market. Although I hated them, I was deeply influenced by them. When I encountered the need to create, I could only rely on some written materials I had collected in the past, or take a hasty look at actual life. What I saw was not necessarily essential, and then I used my limited life experience and the fantasies and fabrications of a petty-bourgeois intellectual to engage in creation presumptuously. Also, because there were too many injustices in the world, sometimes a film would often pile up materials from several films. However, the most effort was put into form and technique, and the theme was often inevitably distorted as a result. In this way, the characters and events portrayed in the works did not proceed according to the laws of life itself, but often according to my own petty-bourgeois thoughts and views.
    This petty-bourgeois creative ideology and creative method, when faced with increased political oppression and a more unfavorable situation, increasingly showed the wavering and weakness of its petty-bourgeois ideology. The most typical example is the production of "The Spring River Flows East." The main mistake of this film was to put my own petty-bourgeois feelings and soul into the body of a female worker, and finally make her commit suicide by drowning, calling it "accusation," but in fact, the effect it achieved may have a profound pessimistic and despairing bad influence. Furthermore, it ignored the individual's subjective efforts, emphasizing the influence of the bad environment on a person, writing a youth who was initially progressive and promising into someone who drifted with the tide and finally degenerated to the point of no return, only knowing how to pursue so-called intense drama and dramatic effects, without thinking about what bad effect he would have on the audience. On the other hand, in order to cater to the demands of the petty bourgeoisie – that is, "being controlled by the moneybag" – I wanted to "expose" more of the reactionary ruling class's debauchery and shamelessness, but in fact, I was appreciating it and playing with it, and objectively giving the audience a certain degree of poisoning. I should point out that this showed a serious compromise and surrender, and not other excuses that could cover it up. The famous Soviet director Gerasimov, after watching this film, although he did not completely deny it, he pointed out: "... there are also some scenes that are just the opposite, they are chilling with their attempt to satisfy the so-called 'public demands'. The film seems to be slapping itself in the face all the time." (See the article "Chinese Film Art," published in "Sino-Soviet Friendship," Volume 2, Issue 3.) This is a very insightful judgment.
    I was unable to accept such criticism in the past. Although I had so many and such serious flaws in my creation, I always showed such a lack of humility: I would find all kinds of wrong reasons to explain myself, and even say that others were "sabotaging" and acting as "street sweepers" for the enemy, and would not seriously distinguish which were slanders and false accusations from the enemy, and which were beneficial and necessary criticisms from our own people. Even if I had already admitted it in my heart, I rarely could accept it calmly. Only after arriving in Beijing and studying did I gradually realize the mistakes I had made in the past. Furthermore, in this study, after listening to the reports of Comrades Hu Qiaomu and Zhou Yang, reading the documents, and receiving the help of comrades, I realized the seriousness of the shortcomings and mistakes contained in my past works. Now, reflecting on it, my attitude at that time was a petty-bourgeois arrogance, complacency, and arrogant individual heroism. It was this bad attitude that was preventing me from facing my own shortcomings and hindering my progress.
    In continuing to reflect, I was very "surprised" to find that accompanying this arrogant "self-importance" was another strong attitude of "self-deprecation and self-belittlement." In the past, every time in creation, I always threw myself into it with all my heart and all my life. When throwing myself into it, I was always "self-righteous," and worked in an infinitely high state of emotion, like throwing myself at the raging waves and tides; but when the tide passed – after the work was completed, even though I had exhausted all my strength – to the point that my body was seriously injured, I often felt that it was of little use, and sometimes even felt that it was unbearable to look at! As one wave after another crashed over, I felt that I seemed to have no achievements at all, and I felt increasingly empty, sometimes even doubting whether I still had the ability to create, and whether I still looked like a progressive filmmaker. Now, examining it, this is precisely because my political level was too low, and it showed a serious detachment from politics, life, the masses, and struggle, which made me unable to cross the boundaries of the petty bourgeoisie and leap into the ideological field of the proletariat, thus causing the works to contain many shortcomings and errors from content to form. However, this "long-standing" lesson did not promptly prompt my attention, and consciously strive to overcome this defect. This petty-bourgeois self-satisfied yet self-deprecating, self-deprecating yet self-satisfied personal consciousness can be said to have reached an alarming degree. In addition to objective reasons, this is also the key and basic reason why I did not make sufficient efforts and therefore failed to do a good job in the film work in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

    II
    Because I had worked in the private film industry in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and Hong Kong for so long, that set of petty-bourgeois ways of thinking and creative methods, as well as its methods of struggle, scope of work, and audience for publishing works, these old practices accumulated over the years have formed its own "system" and are deeply rooted in my thinking. As a literary and art worker, when this petty-bourgeois way of thinking and standpoint becomes a stumbling block to the times and an obstacle to the revolution in the new society, it seems not too difficult to drive it out and replace it with the proletarian way of thinking, creative methods, and all new ways of struggle, etc., but in fact, it is by no means so simple. Without a fierce ideological struggle and without a thorough ideological remolding, it is impossible to achieve such a wish. It is precisely because my deeply rooted petty-bourgeois ideological standpoint and method continue to exist, sometimes even if it is temporarily hidden due to conscious restraint and is restricted by objective forces, it still plays a leading role in my ideological field, just as Chairman Mao pointed out at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art: "Deep in the soul is still a petty-bourgeois kingdom," thus causing me to continue to have many deviations or errors in my work process and opinions in the past two years.
    The first meeting I participated in after arriving in Beijing was the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers. At the meeting, I listened to the reports of the leaders and many comrades, and watched the performances of various types of dramas in the old liberated areas. All of these made me feel infinitely fresh and infinitely excited. At the same time, comparing these simple and solid works from the old areas that shone with proletarian thought with my past works that were full of petty-bourgeois thought made me sweat profusely and initially realized that the old way was really not working. Therefore, when "The Spring River Flows East" was "exhibited and performed," I did not have the courage to watch it again. Later, comrades suggested sending this film to the Soviet Union (Gerasimov's article was not translated until July of the following year, and I had not seen it yet), and I firmly opposed it. I did consciously try to criticize my petty-bourgeois thinking and learn to arm my mind with proletarian thinking; but the effectiveness of this, when examined today, is still so slight that it makes me feel extremely ashamed!
    The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers called on everyone to strive to implement the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers as instructed by Chairman Mao at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. I enthusiastically approved of this and raised my hand, but I can say that I fundamentally did not understand its spirit and essence. I still understood it and accepted it through my own petty-bourgeois ideological standpoint and method. Therefore, when encountering specific examples, I would often be confused and feel that there was no way, and the method I finally came up with was still the petty-bourgeois one!
    This petty-bourgeois thinking is not "lonely." It has many companions, and under new conditions, it will always attempt to revise, distort, or even replace Chairman Mao's literary and art thinking. After the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, many erroneous ideas were not clarified. For example, today our People's Liberation Army has entered the cities and there are many big cities. The literary and art direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers does not necessarily have to write entirely about workers, peasants, and soldiers. Writing about the remolding of urban citizens, students, women, etc. is also possible. Starting from this, it was finally distorted to mean that the literary and art direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers is to write about the themes of urban citizens, students, women, etc.! For example, regarding the private film industry, although I was not a decision-maker, I still bore a certain degree of responsibility. I was not able to look at this industry with a revolutionary perspective. I was not able to strictly distinguish this cause of ideological and cultural education from general industry and commerce, nor was I able to recognize the distance in essence between revolutionary petty-bourgeois works and proletarian works. Instead, I was holding onto the petty-bourgeois conservative method of "reform," thinking that it could "slightly improve" and continue working as before for a certain period of time. This was wrong.
    In the winter of 1949, the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture was established, and the leaders wanted me to serve as the director of the Art Committee. This made me feel terrified, and I did not sleep for several days. Because I reflected that my political level was too low, my theoretical cultivation was so poor, and I could be said to have no understanding of new policies, ideas, and new things. How could I be competent for such important work? I strongly resigned from such a position to the leaders, asking for a secondary position so that I could study and work with peace of mind. However, I could not resist the repeated persuasion of my comrades, and I finally had to agree in a state of extreme trepidation. However, the burden I bear in my heart has not been relieved to this day. But this is mainly because I have not worked hard enough in my studies and have not improved my understanding. This is a consequence that I should be responsible for myself.
    The most important political task of the Art Committee is to implement Chairman Mao's literary and art line and ensure that it is well implemented in our film production. From the very beginning of the work, I always reminded myself to stand firm and do my work with proletarian thinking. But this was only an empty concept. What is a standpoint, what is proletarian thinking, I was actually still at a loss. What I was most familiar with was still the petty-bourgeois stuff. I also reflected on this, so I became very restrained at the beginning and did not dare to speak lightly. However, since I was one of the directors, I had to speak, and as soon as I spoke, I exposed my petty-bourgeois way of thinking or standpoint. For example, at the first meeting of the Art Committee and at the enlarged meeting of the Art Committee, my speech was to understand Chairman Mao's literary and art direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers as people's movies with the progressive movies of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie. I was not able to analyze from the proletarian standpoint, and I did not clearly divide the boundaries between the two. I did not fundamentally recognize that from the past progressive films to today's worker-peasant-soldier films, there is a huge change in essence. This change must be completed by revolutionary means, not by conservative and reforming methods. Adopting this conservative and reforming method is like what Comrade Zhou Yang pointed out in his report: "That is to remove the revolutionary content of 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art,' making this speech lower to the degree that all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois liberals can accept." My view is a fundamentally wrong and very dangerous view. Fortunately, the comrades did not agree, so that basically wrong deviations were not caused in the entire work, but it cannot be said that it did not leave its very bad influence among the comrades in the new district – especially among the comrades like me who had not received ideological remolding and still maintained a strong petty-bourgeois ideology.
    At that time, because I saw a large number of American imperialist films and negative films from private companies still flooding the market, I shortsightedly felt that if the works of private companies could be "improved" a little, it would be better than those productions full of toxins. Therefore, I did not demand that the revolutionary petty-bourgeois progressive filmmakers carry out thorough ideological remolding and actively move forward in the direction of worker-peasant-soldier literature and art. On the other hand, deep in my mind, I did not fail to feel that the progressive films of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie, if they could be "improved" and enriched, would be today's people's films. At the same time, I still regarded the private film industry as not much different from general industry and commerce. For the sake of their work stoppages and losses, and to take care of their survival, and saying that in the past, the capitalists who engaged in the progressive film industry had no losses, I inappropriately proposed: temporarily they can "focus on profit and supplement with cultural education." Although I am not directly responsible for the creation of the private film industry, my words have an impact, which made some backward workers in the film industry at that time feel relaxed and say: "This will be easy!" After receiving this "encouragement," some of the products of the private film factories had a tendency to be crudely made. In this comprehensive guiding principle of the private film industry, the political principles were seriously lost!
    After that, in the test of practical work, in political study and in learning from comrades, although I have gained a little and progressed a little, my ass is basically still sitting on the petty-bourgeois standpoint, and petty-bourgeois thinking is still playing a dominant role in my mind. For example, I still hold the same view of the private film industry as before, thinking that it should have a "transformation period." In a specific stage, as long as something is removed and something is added, it will be a "good thing." Of the 26 feature films of the Film Bureau, only two wrote about subjects other than workers, peasants, and soldiers. After hearing some inappropriate words, because it happened to meet the requirements of my own potential petty-bourgeois thinking, I intuitively felt that it was too little, and that some subjects could be written more diversely. In fact, I wanted to lower the requirements to adapt to the backward thinking of the urban audience. I did not think that the main need to improve the understanding of the urban audience is to educate them with works that write about workers, peasants, and soldiers. At the "July 1st" commemoration meeting in 1951, I excessively emphasized the role of past progressive films and regarded it as the "tradition" of today's people's films. I did not see that: People's films under the guidance of proletarian thought should learn from all excellent works, but it is impossible to go back to learn from revolutionary petty-bourgeois progressive films. In a certain meeting, I even inappropriately cited the example of "tractor" mentioned by Stalin in "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" to illustrate that the people's film cause should also be "gradual change" – although I stated at the time that this was an inappropriate analogy, such a statement was fundamentally wrong. This exactly reflected my maintaining a "traditional" and "reform" conservative approach to the practice of people's films in the new era; the understanding that there must be another ideological revolution on the basis of the past revolutionary petty-bourgeois progressive films is very lacking. There are more examples of these in my other speeches and actions, and in the opinions I gave to comrades' creations, but I will not go into details here.
    In short, because my petty-bourgeois way of thinking and method still stubbornly exist, or rather: it is lurking under the restriction of objective forces and my conscious restraint, but it will come out as soon as it has the opportunity, put forward its proposals, and express its opinions. Today, I deeply feel that: In the past two years, although I have gained some gains in learning and have not made no progress in work, because I have not consciously touched my fundamental problem in my own subjective way, that is, the problem of petty-bourgeois way of thinking and method, therefore, progress is still greatly limited.

    III
    Looking at the problem today, it is clearer: the works of petty-bourgeois thinking will inevitably go to decline, and the works of Chairman Mao's literary and art direction will inevitably have a brilliant future. This can be clearly seen from the success or failure of worker-peasant-soldier films and revolutionary petty-bourgeois progressive films in the past two years. The worker-peasant-soldier film began with "The Bridge." This film is a production with epoch-making significance in the people's film cause. It is basically good, correct, and simple. However, precisely because of its "simplicity," and its inability to avoid roughness and more or less conceptualization, it was not easily accepted by urban audiences who were accustomed to American films and revolutionary petty-bourgeois progressive films. Therefore, some people clamored and felt that before the film cause could be largely sent to the countryside, the films of workers, peasants, and soldiers were impossible, and it was necessary to "change course"! But fortunately, the comrades persisted and did not succumb or compromise. Therefore, on the one hand, films represented by "The White Haired Girl" and "Steel Warrior" have successively gained unprecedentedly broad and enthusiastic welcome from audiences in major cities across the country, and have completely laid the foundation for the belief of worker-peasant-soldier films in the masses. On the other hand, when the anti-people and anti-historicalist and ugly "The Story of Wu Xun" appeared, it was severely criticized nationwide; at the same time, when films such as "Between Husband and Wife," which distorted the images of the working people and revolutionary cadres with petty-bourgeois thinking, and "Company Commander Guan," which distorted the images of people's soldiers, and "Couple's March," etc., also received criticism from literary and art circles and readers.
    Here I want to add a note. The first draft of "The Story of Wu Xun" (at that time, there was only one episode, but it was roughly the same), I and a few friends had already seen in the winter of 1947. At that time, Mr. Sun Yu had just returned from the United States and entered the pseudo-China Film Studio to work. He took that story to us for advice. Although I hated Wu Xun's ugly image of wagging his tail and begging for mercy, and I also had a series of question marks in my mind about what role this work would play in the audience, but because I was influenced by Mr. Tao Xingzhi's propaganda, and I was a petty bourgeois who was influenced by bourgeois thinking, I was not able to make further understanding, and I was fundamentally ignorant of what role Wu Xun played in Chinese history, and thought that it would not be bad for a person like Wu Xun, who had no power and no influence, to run three free schools for poor children to study? It was this thorough and fundamentally wrong idea that prevented me from stopping Mr. Sun Yu from filming this film.
    After the People's Daily published "We Should Attach Importance to the Discussion of the Film 'The Story of Wu Xun'," and after reading the report of the Wu Xun History Investigation Team, as well as Comrade Zhou Yang's summary paper, I clearly understood that Wu Xun was a big landlord, a big rogue, and a big bully. He rode on the heads of the people. He was the mortal enemy of the people. Therefore, praising him is a crime, a reactionary propaganda that slanders the peasant revolutionary struggle, slanders Chinese history, and slanders the Chinese nation! From this profound criticism of "The Story of Wu Xun," I also received the most poignant and timely education.
    Now the matter is so clearly in front of us that the appearance of the ugly and reactionary "The Story of Wu Xun" is the most concentrated and sharply exposed that the progressive filmmakers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas had serious errors in their thinking to such an extent. This bourgeois reactionary reformist thinking that promotes individual struggle, because it is playing a role in pulling the times back and retrogressing, has received such strong spurn from the people of the whole country; at the same time, the distortions that are filled with petty bourgeois thinking such as "Between Husband and Wife," "Company Commander Guan," and "Couple's March" also exposed the serious shortcomings shown by progressive filmmakers under the test of the new era, and these productions will inevitably become stumbling blocks and obstacles in the progress of the times and will be criticized and condemned by the masses of people!
    On the other hand, the films under the guidance of the worker-peasant-soldier direction, although they still seem not very commensurate with the great achievements of our new China in military, political, economic, etc., are created through the proletarian world view, outlook on life, and artistic view (especially the advanced works), they have expressed the great changes brought about by the new China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, correctly written new laboring people, new heroic life, and all kinds of new things, and have gradually gained more and more enthusiastic love from the broad masses of people across the country, and have been praised and unanimously praised in the international peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. This forms a strong contrast with the former – those productions that are fundamentally reactionary or have serious errors! If we, who have worked in the progressive films in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the past, still have petty-bourgeois thinking like me, or have bourgeois thinking, and still work conservatively and stubbornly, thinking that we have some "reforms" and cherish the old, then we will inevitably make more serious mistakes in our work, and in our works we will inevitably be "the clothes are workers, peasants, and soldiers, but the face is petty-bourgeois," repeating the mistakes of "Between Husband and Wife," "Company Commander Guan," and "Couple's March"!
    Comrade Hu Qiaomu quoted Chairman Mao in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in his report:
    "People from petty bourgeois backgrounds always stubbornly express themselves, publicize their own views, and demand that people transform the Party and transform the world according to the appearance of petty bourgeois intellectuals through various methods, including literary and artistic methods. In this situation, our work is to shout loudly to them, saying: 'Comrades,' your set is not working, the proletariat and the broad masses of people cannot accommodate you, and if we listen to you, we are actually listening to the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and there is a danger of destroying the Party, the country, and our heads."
    This alarm bell is ringing so heavily and loudly for us. This is the beloved motherland warning us and summoning us! It is the beloved Chairman Mao warning us and summoning us!
    The second half of the aforementioned quote also says:
    "Who can we only rely on? We can only transform the Party and transform the world according to the appearance of the proletariat and its vanguard. We hope that the comrades in literary and art circles will recognize the seriousness of this great debate, actively participate in this struggle, and make every comrade sound, to the enemy, to friends, to comrades, to ourselves, so that our entire team is truly unified and consolidated ideologically and organizationally."
    We have entered this ideological remolding study movement in Chairman Mao's great call. In the fierce ideological struggle, in the unfolding of criticism and self-criticism, we have initially examined the errors we have made in the past, and also examined the errors that our friends and comrades have made in the past. The root cause of why I have made many mistakes is that I am still carrying a "progressive" baggage to this day, and petty bourgeois thinking still stubbornly exists; now that I have recognized that it is this baggage and this backward thinking that is hindering my progress, I will resolutely and thoroughly throw this baggage away, and I will also resolutely and thoroughly eliminate this backward thinking! I have made such a determination, and I believe that my friends and comrades who have made similar mistakes will also make the same determination, and in this study, correct all deviations and errors, and achieve thorough ideological remolding; and in the days that follow, adhere to the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and do everything possible to go to life, the masses, and the struggle to temper ourselves, thereby strengthening the work of the Art Committee and the work of script creation, and turning all our production institutions with enterprise characteristics into production institutions led by political thought and artistic thought first, facing the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country – remember Chairman Mao's teachings: our literature and art are first for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and second for the urban petty bourgeoisie, and strive to recognize the route, unify the steps, and strive to create works with high ideological and artistic quality, and strive to implement Chairman Mao's literary and art line!

    改造思想，为贯彻毛主席文艺路线而奋斗！
    蔡楚生
    一
    我正式从事电影工作，是在一九二七年以后的事情。在“九一八”和“一二八”事件中，我看到民族危机的日益深重，和卖国的反动统治者使全国民不聊生，陷于极度悲惨的境地；同时，由于我初步接受了革命理论和苏联电影的影响，从那时起，我的作品就开始转变作风。直到一九四九年五月来解放后的北京，我先后在国民党统治区和香港从事电影工作，在桂林也写过一部舞台剧。
    那些作品是在反动统治和帝国主义直接与间接的压迫之下产生的，我们所做的是一种公开的“合法斗争”；而且由于电影这一艺术形式的限制，我们的作品必须作为“商品”，透过商业的关系才能和群众接触，这就先天地使我们的作品在内容和形式上受到了极大的限制，严重的损害。我并不想掩饰那些作品的缺点，我所说的是事实。我所谈的也只限于个人的作品，而不谈同时代其它的作品。那些作品在那样一个特定的时代和环境里，对革命虽曾经起过一定的协助作用，但今天不谈这些。这里所要谈的，是我在那样的时代和环境的限制下，是否已经做到尽可能好，是否可以进一步地做得更好一些，和在主观上是否曾经做过足够的努力？我的答案是否定的；是没有做得尽可能好，是未能善尽其事地做得更好，主观上也未曾做过足够的努力，而是有着严重的缺点的。
    现在就来检查这些。
    虽说我接受了革命的理论和苏联电影的影响，这些影响并在我的创作生涯中起了一定的指导作用，但我所理解的还是非常肤浅的，所读的书也非常少，我究竟是一个小资产阶级的知识分子，我未直接参加过革命工作，政治水平既低，智识水平也很低，因此表现在我的作品上就存在着许多严重的缺点。
    首先，是关于我的创作思想。我对自己说我要革命，我要运用电影这一武器来为广大的群众写作（其实是只限于城市的市民、学生和知识分子），我的作品要从阶级出发，要写阶级斗争，要用最大的热情来写劳动人民和一切被侮辱与被迫害者，要用最大的憎恨来写反动的统治者和一切压迫者；但我的思想感情并没有跨越小资产阶级的界限，我受了资产阶级思想的影响，也受了一些封建思想的影响，我只能运用小资产阶级的世界观、人生观和艺术观来从事创作。也就是说，我尽管自己认为热爱劳动人民，但实际上却只能做到“同情”而不能用无产阶级的“主人翁”的态度来从事创作。因此表现在我作品中的思想意识就十分纷乱，往往是互相矛盾的：有时把无产阶级放在领导革命的第一位
    （自然是写不像的），有时又把它降到服从小资产阶级的领导；有时隐约给人以一个光明的前瞻，有时又使人感到严重的悲观失望；有时写了一些斗争的疾风暴雨，有时又简直就是在吟风弄月；有时极力在描写广大人民大众爱国、爱真理、爱革命的热情，有时又无知地把反动分子的活动和人民的革命工作混淆起来；有时表现得很朴素、很严肃，有时自命为“大胆”，事实却是写得很低级，简直就是在宣扬资产阶级的那一套；有时写了一点新的道德和伦理的观点，但更多的还是在写“同情”、“人道”和所谓“人性”，……总之，贯串在我所有的作品中的，是一种小资产阶级的思想意识，是用小资产阶级的偏爱和它自由散漫的感情、思想方法的片面性来观察社会、观察人生的。这就使作品赋予它根本性质的缺憾，所以，这是属于革命小资产阶级的范畴的，而不是属于无产阶级革命文艺的范畴的。它虽在那样特定的时代和环境里起过一些作用，但总是显得那样的不健康和有时甚至是有害的。
    次之是创作方法。我除了早年闭塞的农村生活和小城市的学徒生活，以及后期的大城市生活之外，所接触的生活面是很狭窄的，这就表现了严重的脱离政治、生活、群众、斗争的情况。再有就是泛滥在中国电影市场上的美国电影，我虽讨厌它，却受了它很深重的影响。我遇到要创作，就只能靠平时所收集的一些纸面上的材料，或者匆匆到实际生活里看一看，所看到的一些不一定是本质的，再凭仅有的一些生活体验，和小资产阶级分子的幻想和臆造，自以为是地从事创作。也因为人间不平的事情太多，有时一部戏就往往堆砌了几部戏的素材；但所下的功夫最多的还是在形式和技术方面，而主题思想则往往不免因此而被歪曲。这样作品上所表现出来的人物和事件，就不是按照生活本身的法则在进行，而往往是依照自己小资产阶级的思想、观点在进行的。
    这种小资产阶级的创作思想和创作方法，在遇到政治压迫加重和处境更不利的时候，就越发表现自己小资产阶级意识形态中的动摇性和软弱性。最典型的例子是“一江春水向东流”这一制作。这片子主要的错误是把自己小资产阶级的感情和灵魂装进了一个女工的躯体，并使她终于投海自杀，名之为“控诉”，但它在实际上所获得的效果，就可能会有一种深重的悲观绝望的坏影响；再就是忽略了个人主观应有的努力，强调了恶劣的环境对于一个人的影响，把一个最初是进步有为的青年，写成一个随波逐流，终于堕落到不可收拾的地步，只知道在追求所谓强烈的戏剧性和戏剧效果，却没有想到他在观众中将起什么不好的作用。另一面是为迎合小市民的要求——也就是说“受了钱袋的左右”，想更多地“暴露”反动统治阶级的荒淫无耻，但事实却是在欣赏它，玩弄它，客观上也就给予了观众以某种程度的毒害。我应该指出，在这一点上是表现了一种严重的妥协投降，而不是其它的藉词所可以掩饰的。苏联名导演格拉西莫夫在看过这片子后，他虽没有全部加以否定，但他指出：“……又有一些场面刚好相反，它们以其满足所谓‘公众要求’的企图而令人齿冷。影片好像时时在自己打自己的嘴巴。”（见“中国的电影艺术”一文，载“中苏友好”二卷三期）这正是一针见血的论断。
    对这样的批评，我在以前是无法接受的。我在创作上虽有着那样多、那样严重的缺憾，但总是表现得那样不虚心：我会找出种种错误的理由来替自己解释，甚至会说人家是在“破坏”，是在替敌人作
    “清道夫”，而不肯认真地分别出哪些是来自敌人的中伤、诬蔑，哪些是自己人有益的必要的批评。即使是自己心里已经承认，但也很少能心平气和地加以接受。从到北京后，在学习中我才逐渐体会到我过去所犯的这些错误，再加在这次学习中，听了胡乔木、周扬两位同志的报告，读了文件，并且得到同志们的帮助，我才认识到过去作品中包含的缺点和错误的严重。现在反省起来，我那时的态度是一种小资产阶级自高自大、故步自封和狂妄的个人英雄主义，而也就是这种不好的态度在妨碍着我正视自己的缺点，妨碍着我的进步。
    在继续反省中，我却很“奇怪”地觉得伴随着这种狂妄的“自高自大”的态度，还有另一种强烈的“自卑自贬”的态度。过去每次在创作中我总是以全身心、全生命去扑向它的，在扑向它时，我总是“自以为是”，而在情绪的无限高涨中工作着，像扑狂浪巨潮那样地扑着；但当浪潮过去后——作品完成后，虽用尽了全身的气力——以至身体都受了严重的伤害，但我往往又感到它的无甚是处，有时简直是觉得不堪入目！这样一个一个的浪潮扑过来，就感到我根本好像什么成就都没有，而越来越觉得空虚，有时甚至在怀疑自己还有没有创作能力，还像不像一个进步的电影工作者？现在检查起来，这正是由于自己的政治水平太低，和表现了严重的脱离了政治、生活、群众、斗争，而使自己不能跨出小资产阶级的界限，向无产阶级的思想领域跃进，因而造成作品从内容到形式都包含着许多缺点和错误所产生出来的后果。但这种“由来已久”的经验教训，却没有及早促使我的注意，而有意识地力图去克服这种缺憾，这种小资产阶级分子自满而又自卑，自卑而又自满的个人意识，真可以说是到了可惊的程度。除了客观的原因以外，这也就是我没有做过足够的努力，因而没有能够把在国民党统治区的电影工作做好的关键所在，和基本原因的所在。
    二
    由于我过去在国民党统治区和香港的私营电影事业中工作过那样久，那一套小资产阶级的思想方法和创作方法，以及它的斗争方式，工作范畴，发表作品的观众对象，这种种旧的做法，这些在长年累月中积累下来的经验，已经形成了它自己的“体系”，而根深柢固地存在在我的思想中。而作为一个文艺工作者，当这种小资产阶级的思想方法和立场，在新的社会中成为时代的绊脚石，成为革命的障碍物的时候，要把它驱逐出去，清除出去，替之以无产阶级的思想方法，创作方法，以及一切新的斗争方式等等，看着好像并不太难，但事实却绝不那么简单，不经过激烈的思想斗争，不经过彻底的思想改造，就无法达成这样的愿望。也就因为我这种根深柢固的小资产阶级的思想立场方法继续存在着，有时即使因主观有意识的克制，和受到客观力量的制约而暂隐一时，但在我的思想领域中它依旧起着主导的作用，正像毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上所指出的：“灵魂深处还是一个小资产阶级的王国”，因而使我在两年多的工作过程和言论见解中不断地还存在着许多偏差或错误。
    我到北京所参加的第一个会议是全国文艺工作者代表大会。在会上我听了首长和许多同志的报告，看了老解放区各种剧种的演出，对这些都使我感到无限新鲜，无限兴奋；同时拿老区这些辉耀着无产阶级思想的朴质而坚实的作品，来和我过去那些充溢着小资产阶级思想的作品作比，就使我汗流浃背，初步认识到过去的那一套实在不行了，因此当“一江春水向东流”被“展览演出”时我就没有勇气敢再去看它。后来同志们曾提议把这片子送到苏联去（格拉西莫夫的文章到次年的七月才被译过来，那时还未看到），我就坚决反对。我确曾有意识地力图批判自己的小资产阶级思想，而学习用无产阶级思想来武装自己的头脑；但它的成效在今天检查起来还是如何的轻微，这就使我感到莫大的惭愧！
    全国文艺工作者代表大会上号召大家要为贯彻毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上所指示的文艺为工农兵服务的方向而奋斗，我是热烈赞成的，我是举过手的，但对它的精神和实质我可以说根本就没有理解，我还是通过自己小资产阶级的思想立场方法来理解它，接受它的，因此在碰到具体的事例时往往就会迷乱，就会感到没有办法，而最后所拿出来的办法，也还是小资产阶级的那一套！
    这种小资产阶级的思想是并不“寂寞”的，是有很多同伴的，它在新的条件下还会时时企图修改、歪曲、甚或拿来代替毛主席的文艺思想。在全国文艺工作者代表大会后，就曾有许多错误的思想没有得到澄清。譬如说，今天我们的解放军进城了，有了许多大城市，工农兵的文艺方向就不一定要全写工农兵，写些城市的市民、学生、妇女等的改造的题材也可以；从此出发，而终于被歪曲为工农兵的文艺方向就是写城市的市民、学生、妇女等的题材！又譬如对私营的电影事业，我虽非决策人，仍是负有一定程度的责任的。我对这事业，就没有能够运用革命的眼光来看它，没有能够把这种思想教育、文化教育的事业和一般的工商业严格地区别开来，也没有能够认识到从革命的小资产阶级的作品到无产阶级的作品，这两者之间在本质上有着如何的距离，而我却是抱着小资产阶级那一套保守的“改良”的方法来看它，觉得在一定时期内可以“略为改进”地照老样工作下去，这是不对的。
    一九四九年冬天，文化部电影局成立，领导方面要我担任艺术委员会主任的工作，这使我感到惶恐，几天都没有睡着觉。因为我自省到我的政治水平太低，理论修养这样差，对新的政策思想、新的事物还可以说是毫无认识，像这样重要的工作，我如何能够胜任愉快？我向领导方面力辞这样的职务，要求给我一个次要的职位，让我可以安心学习，安心工作；但是经不起同志们的再三劝说，我终于不得不在极度惶恐的心情中答应了下来，然而我心情上担负的沉重，却直到今天也还没有解脱；但这主要是因为我在学习上不努力，在认识上没有得到提高所造成的后果，这是应由我自己负责的。
    艺术委员会最主要的政治任务，就是执行毛主席的文艺路线，使它很好地在我们的电影制作中贯彻下去。工作一开始，我就随时提醒自己，要站稳立场，要用无产阶级的思想来做好我的工作。但这只有一个空洞的概念，什么是立场，什么是无产阶级的思想，我实际上还是茫然的。我所最熟悉的还是小资产阶级的那一套。我也自省到这一些，因此在开始的时候就变得十分拘谨，不敢轻于发言；然而我既是主任之一，就不能不发言，一发言就暴露了我的小资产阶级的思想方法或立场。譬如在第一次艺术委员会的会议上，以及艺术委员会的扩大会议上，我的发言就是以革命小资产阶级的进步电影来理解毛主席的工农兵文艺方向的人民电影，没有能够从无产阶级的立场来进行分析，没有把这两者的界限很明显地划分开来，没有在根本上来认识从过去的进步电影到今天的工农兵电影在本质上是一个巨大的变革，这个变革，是要用革命的手段来完成的，而不是用保守、改良的方法来完成的。采取了这种保守、改良的方法，也就是像周扬同志在报告中所指出的：“那就是去掉‘在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’的革命内容，使这个讲话降低到一切资产阶级、小资产阶级的自由主义者都可以接受的程度。”我的这种看法是一种犯着根本性质的错误的看法，也是一种非常危险的看法。幸而同志们并没有同意，不致在整个的工作上造成基本上错误的偏向，但它在新区的同志们中间——特别是像我那样的没有得到思想改造而还保持着浓厚的小资产阶级思想的同志们中间，却不能说是没有留下它很坏的影响的。
    那时我因为看到大量美帝国主义电影和私营的消极片还在市场上泛滥着，就短视地觉得私营的作品如能“改进”一些，总比那些充满着毒素的制作要好些，因而没有要求革命小资产阶级的进步电影工作者，作彻底的思想改造，向着工农兵的文艺方向积极前进；另一方面，在我的思想深处也未尝不觉得革命小资产阶级的进步电影，如果能加以“改进”和充实，也就是今天的人民电影了。同时我也还把私营的电影事业和一般的工商业作差不了多少的看待，为了他们的停工亏蚀，为了照顾到他们的生存，并说过去从事进步电影事业的资方就没有不亏蚀的，因而不恰当地提出：暂时他们可以“以营利为主，文化教育为辅”。私营的电影事业在创作上我虽不直接负有什么责任，但我的话是有影响的，而使当时部分落后的制片业的工作者，听了顿觉轻松地说：“这就好办了！”他们得到这种“鼓励”以后私营电影厂的出品中部分有着粗制滥造的倾向，在这一个私营电影业的全面指导方针上是严重地丧失政治原则立场的！
    此后，在实际工作的考验中，在政治学习和向同志们的学习中，我虽多少有点体会，多少有点进步，但我的屁股基本上还是坐在小资产阶级的立场上，小资产阶级的思想仍在我的脑子里起着统治作用。譬如我对私营的电影事业，仍持以前一贯的看法，以为它应该有一个“转化期”，在一个特定的阶段中，只要去掉什么，又加进什么，就是“好东西”了。对电影局二十六部故事片中，只有两部写工农兵以外的题材，在听到一些不恰当的话之后，因为正好适应了自己潜在的小资产阶级思想的要求，也就直觉地觉得是太少了些，觉得部分题材是可以写得多样性些，而事实是想降低要求来适应城市观众的落后思想的一面，没有想到为提高城市观众的认识主要的正需要用写工农兵的作品来教育他们。在一九五一年“七一”的纪念会上，我过分地强调了过去进步电影的作用，并把它看成了今天人民电影的“传统”，没有看到：在无产阶级思想指导下的人民电影，应该向一切优秀的作品学习，但不可能倒退回去向革命小资产阶级进步电影看齐。我在某一个会议中，甚至还不恰当地举出斯大林所著“马克思主义与语言学问题”中所提“拖拉机”的举例，用来说明人民的电影事业也应该是“渐变”的——虽然我当时声明这是不恰当的比喻，但这样的提法根本就是错误的。这恰恰就反映了我对于新时代的人民电影的做法，保持有一种因袭过去“传统”的、“改良”保守的做法；必须要在过去革命小资产阶级进步电影的基础上，再进行一次思想大革命，这种理解是非常缺乏的。这些在我其它的发言行事中，以及对同志们的创作所提的意见中，可举的例子还有，但在这里就不细说了。
    总之，由于我这种小资产阶级的思想立场方法还是顽强地存在着，或者说：它在客观力量的制约下和我主观上有意识的克制下而是潜伏着，但一有机会它就要冲出来，提出它的主张，发表它的意见。到今天我是深感到：我两年多来，在学习上虽不无收获，工作上也不是一无进步，但由于自己主观上还没有有意识地去触动自己的根本问题，即小资产阶级的思想立场方法问题，因此，进步也还是有着重大的限制的。
    三
    今天来看问题是更清楚了：小资产阶级思想的作品必然地走向没落，毛主席文艺方向的作品必然地有着光辉灿烂的前途，这从两年多以来的工农兵电影和革命小资产阶级进步电影的成败消长中就可以很明显地看出来。工农兵电影是以“桥”开始的，这片子是人民电影事业一部有划时代意义的制作，它基本上是好的、正确的、而也是朴素的。但也就因为它的“朴素”，和不能免于粗糙与或多或少的概念化，一时不易为看惯美国电影和革命小资产阶级进步电影的城市观众所接受，于是某些人就哗然了，觉得电影事业在未能大量下乡以前，工农兵的电影是走不通的，必须“改弦易辙”！但幸而同志们坚持着，没有屈服和迁就。因此，就一方面是以“白毛女”“钢铁战士”等为代表的影片先后在全国各大城市获得了空前未有的广大的观众热烈的欢迎，完全地奠定了工农兵电影在群众中信仰的基础。另一面当出现了反人民、反历史主义的、丑恶的“武训传”时，就受到了全国范围的严厉的批判；同时当出现了以小资产阶级思想歪曲劳动人民和革命干部形象的“我们夫妇之间”，和歪曲了人民战士形象的“关连长”，以及“夫妇进行曲”等等影片时，也先后受到了文艺界和读者的批评。
    这里我要补叙一笔，“武训传”的初稿（那时只有一集，但大体上是差不多的），在一九四七年的冬天，我和三几位朋友就已看过了。当时孙瑜先生刚从美国回来，入伪中国电影制片厂工作，拿那故事要我们提意见。我虽讨厌武训那摇尾乞怜的丑恶的形象，而且对这作品将在观众中起些什么作用，也在心里打着一连串的问号，但因为受了陶行知先生宣传的影响，自己又是一个受了资产阶级思想影响的小资产阶级，没有能够作更进一步的认识，和对武训在中国的历史上究竟扮演一个什么角色根本就是无知的，而以为像武训这样一个无权无势的人，能办三个义学给穷孩子们去读书，也没有什么不好吧？就是这种彻头彻尾犯了根本性质的严重的错误思想，使我没有阻止孙瑜先生对这片的摄制。
    及后从人民日报发表了“应当重视电影‘武训传’的讨论”起，到读了武训历史调查团的报告，以及周扬同志带有总结性的论文，我才清楚地理解到武训是一个大地主、大流氓、大恶霸，他是骑在人民头上的，他是人民的死敌，因此对他加以歌颂，就是一种罪恶，一种诬蔑农民革命斗争，诬蔑中国历史，诬蔑中国民族的反动宣传！而从这次对
    “武训传”的深刻的批判中，也就使我受了最痛切的和及时的教育。
    现在事情是这样清楚地摆在我们眼前，丑恶而反动的“武训传”之出现，正是最集中而尖锐地暴露了国民党统治区进步的电影工作者在思想上有着严重到如此程度的错误，这种资产阶级宣扬个人奋斗的反动的改良主义思想，因它在起着把时代向后拉着倒退的作用，而受到全国人民这样强烈的唾弃；同时，像“我们夫妇之间”和“关连长”“夫妇进行曲”等这些充满着小资产阶级思想的歪曲的制作，也暴露了进步的电影工作者在新的时代的考验下所表现出来的严重的缺点，而这些制作也必然要成为时代在前进中的绊脚石、障碍物，而受到人民大众的批评和指责！
    另一面是在工农兵方向指导下的电影，它虽然还显得和我们新中国在军事、政治、经济等等伟大的成就不大相称，但因为它（特别是其中的先进作品）是通过无产阶级的世界观、人生观、艺术观来创作的，它表现了新中国在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下所起的伟大变革，正确地写出了新的劳动人民，新的英雄生活，以及各种新的事物，逐步地获得了全国广大人民越来越热烈的喜爱，并在以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营中获得了褒奖，受到了一致的推崇。这和前者——那些在根本上是反动的，或者是带有严重错误的制作，是形成了一种如何强烈的对照！我们从过去国民党统治区的进步电影中工作过来的人，如果像我这样还存在着小资产阶级的思想，或存在着资产阶级的思想，而仍故步自封、自以为有些“改良”而抱残守缺地工作下去，那么在工作中就必将还要犯更严重的错误，在作品上也必将是“衣服是工农兵，面孔却是小资产阶级”，重蹈“我们夫妇之间”，以及“关连长”“夫妇进行曲”等的覆辙！
    胡乔木同志在报告中引用毛主席在“延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”说：
    “小资产阶级出身的人们总是经过种种方法，也经过文学艺术的方法，顽强地表现他们自己，宣传他们自己的主张，要求人们按照小资产阶级知识分子的面貌来改造党，改造世界。在这种情形下，我们的工作，就是要向他们大喝一声，说：‘同志’们，你们那一套是不行的，无产阶级和人民大众是不能迁就你们的，依了你们，实际上就是依了大地主大资产阶级，就有亡党亡国亡头的危险。”
    这警钟对我们是敲得如此之沉重而响亮，这是亲爱的祖国在警醒我们，召唤我们！是亲爱的毛主席在警醒我们，召唤我们！
    同上所引前文的下半段又说：
    “只能依谁呢？只能依照无产阶级及其先锋队的面貌改造党，改造世界。我们希望文艺界的同志们认识这一场大论战的严重性，积极起来参加这个斗争，向敌人，向朋友，向同志，向自己，使每个同志都健全起来，使我们整个队伍在思想上和组织上都真正统一起来，巩固起来。”
    我们是在毛主席这伟大的号召中投入这改造思想的学习运动中来了，在激烈的思想斗争中，在展开批评和自我批评中，我们初步检查出自己过去所犯的错误，也检查出朋友们同志们过去所犯的错误。我所以会犯许多错误的根源，是直到今天还背着一个“进步”的包袱，和小资产阶级的思想依然顽强地存在着；既认清了是这个包袱和这种落后的思想在妨碍着我的前进，我就要坚决而彻底地把这个包袱抛掉它，也要坚决而彻底地把这种落后的思想清除出去！我下了这样的决心，相信和我犯过相类似的错误的朋友们同志们也会下同样的决心，而在这次的学习中纠正一切的偏差和错误，达到彻底的思想改造；并在此后的日子中，坚持对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的学习，尽一切可能，到生活、群众、斗争中去锻炼，从而把艺术委员会的工作和剧本创作所的工作加强起来，把我们所有带企业性质的制片机构，变为首先是有政治思想、艺术思想领导的制作机构，面向全国广大的工农兵人民大众——要深切记住毛主席对我们的教导：我们的文艺，首先是为工农兵的，其次是为城市小资产阶级的，做到认清路线，统一步调，为创作具有高度思想性和艺术性的作品而奋斗，为贯彻毛主席的文艺路线而奋斗！
