    I Sever My Father-Daughter Relationship with Embezzler Shi Zengrun
  　Shi Shuyun
    My name is Shi Shuyun, I am sixteen years old, a member of the Communist Youth League, and a student at the Beijing New Life Girls' Middle School. My father's name is Shi Zengrun, and he works as the head of the material section at the Shijingshan Power Plant. He is a shameful embezzler, but he resolutely refused to confess during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. I have already declared that I sever my father-daughter relationship with him.

    After this movement started, I thought: this movement was called for by Chairman Mao and is of great significance to resisting America, aiding Korea, and building the country, so I must actively participate. I also thought: my father is the head of the material section and has more opportunities to contact businessmen. I don't know if he has any corrupt behavior. If he does, I will mobilize him to confess. If he doesn't, I will also mobilize him to report others. When I returned home from school (my home is in Shijingshan), I hurried to inquire about my father's affairs. Someone told me: "Your father is an embezzler. Everyone has been persuading him to confess, but he refuses to confess." I was very angry when I heard this, so I went to the Party organization in the factory to ask about my father's embezzlement. The person in charge of the Party organization told me: "The things your father bought were expensive and of poor quality. The machines he bought are already unusable." Later, I also learned that my father had embezzled more than two hundred million yuan in the procurement of equipment. I was so angry that I didn't want to go back, so I slept at someone else's house that night. The next morning, I returned home and took down the "Glorious Military Family" certificate and Mayor Peng Zhen's New Year's card hanging in his room. I thought that my sister's joining the army was not to bring glory to an embezzler. He does not deserve this glorious title. After returning to school, I said to the Youth League branch: "I don't recognize this father anymore. I want to break off my father-daughter relationship with him."

    After clarifying these circumstances, the Youth League branch advised me to go back and mobilize him to confess. Before leaving, I said to the Youth League branch: "Today I am going to the battlefield!" When I got home, I saw him sitting in the room. I said to him: "I know everything. Everyone has told me. Only Chairman Mao is so great that he initiated this movement to build our country well; he also gives embezzlers the opportunity to confess. If you don't confess, are you worthy of Chairman Mao?" He said, "If I confess, what about your tuition?" I said, "Don't worry about that. I am studying to serve the people, and the people will take care of me. Aren't the people supporting my schooling now?" I also said to him: "My sister joined the People's Liberation Army to defend the motherland, and we should protect the property of the motherland in the rear." He said, "Your future is very good, very bright." I said, "Of course, in the era of Chairman Mao, the future is bright. It will also be bright if you confess. Some bad elements refuse to take the bright path and insist on鑽ing into the darkness, and cannot be pulled out." After a pause, he did not speak. I continued: "Quickly tell me if you have any problems! If you confess, you are my father; if you don't confess properly, you are not my father. I am a member of the Youth League and must fight against bad elements. Those who embezzle state property are enemies of the revolution and my enemies!" His face changed, and he said slyly, "You are so good, huh?" I was even more angry and said to him, "Don't be slippery! Think carefully about how the Party promoted you after liberation, promoting you from a worker to the head of a section. Who are you being worthy of by doing this?"

    At this time, the factory called him to attend a general meeting, and I went with him. The list of embezzlers was announced at the meeting. I shouted slogans along with the worker comrades: "Down with embezzlers!" When the chairman called his name, I was particularly resentful, stood up, and clapped hard. I only knew that he was an enemy of the people and did not think of him as my father at all. I asked to speak on the stage. When I spoke, there was special applause and welcome from the audience. I was really happy. I said: "Uncles! I announce to you that I do not recognize him as my father. I want to break off my father-daughter relationship with him. I fully support the People's Government's punishment of him. I must strive to the end for the cause of New Democracy and Communism under the leadership and cultivation of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!" Then I led everyone to shout slogans: "Resolutely eliminate embezzlers!" "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the working class!"

    After the meeting, I thought: as long as I firmly stand on the revolutionary position, I will definitely be able to defeat the enemy. Back at school, I reported to the Youth League branch: "I won a great victory this time! In the future, I will definitely study harder and be a good daughter of the people!" (Xinhua News Agency)

    我和贪污分子史增润断绝父女关系
  　史淑云
    我叫史淑云，今年十六岁了，是一个青年团员，在北京市新生女子中学读书。我父亲叫史增润，在石景山发电厂做材料股长。他是一个可耻的贪污犯，可是他在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中坚决不肯坦白。我已经声明和他断绝父女关系了。
    这个运动开始以后，我就想：这个运动是毛主席号召的，对抗美援朝和国家建设有很大的意义，我要积极参加。我又想：我父亲是材料股长，和商人接触的机会比较多，不知有没有贪污行为，如果有的话，我就要动员他坦白，如果没有，我也要动员他检举别人。我从学校回到家里（我家在石景山），连忙去打听我父亲的事情。别人告诉我说：“你父亲是个贪污犯，大家劝他坦白，他还不肯坦白。”我一听非常生气，就去找厂里的党组织，问我父亲的贪污情况。党组织的负责人告诉我说：“你父亲买的东西价钱贵，货色还不好，他买来的机器已经不能用了。”后来我又知道我父亲在采买器材时共贪污了两亿多元。我气得不想回去了，夜里就睡在别人家里。第二天早晨我回到家里，把挂在他屋里的“光荣军属”证和彭真市长的贺年片摘下来，我想我姐姐去参军不是给贪污分子挣光荣的，他不配这个光荣的称号，我回到学校后就对团支部说：“我不承认这个爸爸了，我要和他脱离父女关系。”
    团支部在问明了这些情况后，就劝我回去动员他坦白。临走的时候我对团支部说：“今天我要去上战场了！”回到家里，见他正在屋里坐着。我对他说：“一切事情我都知道了。别人都对我说了。只有毛主席这么伟大，提出来搞这个运动，好建设咱们的国家；还给贪污分子坦白的机会。你如果再不坦白，对得起毛主席吗？”他说：“我坦白了，你的学费怎么办呢？”我说：“不用顾虑这个。我学习是为人民服务，人民会管我。现在不也是人民供给我上学吗？”我又对他讲：“姐姐参加解放军保卫祖国，咱们在后方应当保护祖国的财产。”他说：“你的前途很好，很光明。”我说：“当然，在毛主席的时代前途都是光明的。你坦白出来也光明。有的坏分子，放着光明道儿不走，死往黑暗处钻，拉也拉不出来，那可没办法。”停了一会儿，他不说话。我接着说：“有问题快点儿讲！你坦白出来就是我的爸爸，不好好坦白就不是我的爸爸，我是青年团员，就要向坏分子作斗争。贪污国家财产的是革命的敌人，就是我的敌人！”他变了脸，狡猾地说：“你这么好，呵？”我更生气了，对他说：“不用耍滑头！你好好想想，解放后党怎么提拔你，把你从工人提拔成股长。你这样做对得起谁？”
    这时候厂里叫他去开大会，我也跟着一块儿去了。会上宣布贪污分子的名单，我跟着工人同志们一块儿喊口号：“打倒贪污分子！”当主席叫到他的名字的时候，我特别愤恨，站起来，使劲拍手。我只知道他是人民的敌人，根本没有想到他是我的爸爸。我要求到台上去发言。我讲话的时候，台下特别鼓掌欢迎，我真高兴，我讲：“叔叔们！我向你们宣布，我不承认他是我爸爸，我要和他脱离父女关系。我完全拥护人民政府对他的处罚。我一定要在毛主席、共产党的领导下，培养下，为新民主主义事业和共产主义事业奋斗到底！”接着就领着大家喊口号：“坚决消灭贪污分子！”“共产党万岁！“毛主席万岁！”“工人阶级万岁！”
    会后我想：只要坚决地站在革命立场上，就一定能战胜敌人。回到学校，我对团支部报告：“这一次打了一个大胜仗！今后我一定更努力学习，做人民的好女儿！”（新华社）
