    Northeast Industrial Department Mechanical Bureau
    Overcomes Waste in Capital Construction, Exceeds Production Increase and Savings Plan
    Since the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department Mechanical Bureau's capital construction departments responded to Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government's call to launch a production increase and savings campaign, they had, by November 5th of last year, increased production and saved the country wealth equivalent to more than 12,600 tons of grain, exceeding the annual production increase and savings target by more than 22%. Over the past six months, the Northeast Mechanical Bureau's engineering teams have all reduced project costs. Their methods are: breaking through labor and material quotas, eliminating idle work and work stoppages due to lack of materials; strengthening material acceptance and management systems to avoid using large materials for small purposes, using superior materials for inferior purposes, and losses caused by repeated transportation due to non-standard materials; reducing administrative expenses, and using winter slack time to organize forces for technical design, etc. After adopting these methods, the total value of cost reductions achieved by the engineering teams has reached 7,938 tons of grain. They adopted the thin slurry grouting method for bricklaying, created stone washing equipment, manufactured wooden winch towers, and modified transport carts, saving wealth equivalent to 415 tons of grain. In addition, they utilized waste electrical wires, broken bricks, waste asbestos tiles, and scrap rails, saving wealth equivalent to 1,228 tons of grain.
    Through the production increase and savings campaign over the past six months, the operational management work of various construction units has greatly improved. For example, all units have strictly implemented inspection systems to ensure project quality, established acceptance organizations led by the chief engineer, and established handover systems after project completion. These measures not only reduced material consumption below quotas and ensured project progress, but also made project quality exceed general standards.

    东北工业部机械管理局
    克服基本建设上的浪费超额完成增产节约计划
    东北人民政府工业部机械管理局基本建设部门自东北人民政府主席高岗号召展开增产节约运动以来，到去年十一月五日止，已为国家增产节约了价值等于一万二千六百多吨粮食的财富，超过了全年增产节约任务百分之二十二以上。半年来，东北机械管理局各工程队都降低了工程成本。他们的办法是：突破工料定额，消灭窝工及停工待料现象；加强材料验收与管理制度，避免大材小用、优材劣用和因材料不合规格往返运输而造成的损失；减少管理费的开支和利用冬闲时间组织力量进行技术设计等等。采取这些办法以后，各工程队降低成本的总值已达到七千九百三十八吨粮食。他们采用了灌稀浆砌砖法，创造了洗石子的设备，制造了木质卷扬塔，改造了运输小车等，共节约价值等于四百一十五吨粮食的财富。另外，他们利用废电线、破砖、废石绵瓦、废铁轨等，也节约了价值等于一千二百二十八吨粮食的财富。
    经过半年来的增产节约运动，各施工单位的经营管理工作已大有改进。如各单位都严格执行了保证工程质量的检查制度，成立了以总工程师为领导的验收组织，建立了工程竣工后的交接制度。这些措施，不但使工料消耗降低到定额以下，保证了工程的进度，并使工程质量超过了一般水平。
