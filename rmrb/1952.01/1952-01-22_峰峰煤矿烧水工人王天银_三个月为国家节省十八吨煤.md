    Wang Tianyin, a Boiler Worker at Fengfeng Coal Mine,
    Saves 18 Tons of Coal for the Country in Three Months
    Editor: Wang Tianyin, a boiler worker at the Fengfeng Coal Mine No. 1 in Hebei Province, saved 18 tons of coal in three months. In the past, the boiler Wang Tianyin managed consumed 12 tons of coal per month. Since the propagandist of No. 1 Mine called on everyone to pay attention to conservation at the end of August last year, Wang Tianyin said: "The mine is our home, and the workers are all masters of the house. If we just eat and do our jobs perfunctorily every day without paying attention to conservation, what kind of masters are we?" He finally found the trick to saving coal in the boiler. He discovered that the flames burning from under the furnace were not concentrated, and the scale inside the boiler was too thick, which were the root causes of wasting coal. So, he used the spare time that didn't interfere with the workers' drinking water to smooth and flatten the boiler, making it airtight, so that the flames burning from under the furnace could be concentrated. Then, he scraped off the scale inside the boiler, so the water boiled faster. As a result, six tons of coal were enough each month. In three months (from September to November), Wang Tianyin saved a total of 18 tons of coal for the country.

    峰峰煤矿烧水工人王天银
    三个月为国家节省十八吨煤
    编辑同志：河北省峰峰煤矿一矿烧水工人王天银，三个月节省用煤十八吨。过去王天银管理的锅炉，每月要烧十二吨煤。自去年八月底一矿宣传鼓动员号召大家注意节约后，王天银说：“矿厂就是自己的家，工人全是当家人，我们若天天吃饭应付差事，不注意节省，还算什么当家人呢？”他终于在锅炉上找到了节约用煤的窍门。他发现炉底下烧出来的火苗不集中；锅炉里面的水锈也太厚，这些都是浪费煤的病根子。于是他利用不耽误工人喝水的空闲时间，把锅炉抹得又光滑，又平坦，又不透风，使炉底下烧出来的火苗能集中；再刮掉锅内的水锈，水就开得快了。这样一来，每个月用六吨煤就够了。在三个月内（九月到十一月），王天银共给国家节省了十八吨煤的财富。
