Northwest Military and Political Committee Deputy Minister of Finance
Ma Nanfeng Suppresses Democracy and Hinders Rectification; Immediate Correction Required

In the rectification movement centered on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, many leading cadres of the first-level organs in the Northwest region have adopted various methods to promote democracy, enlighten the masses to report, inspect, and confess, thus exposing many problems. However, at present, some responsible comrades in some units still adopt incorrect attitudes towards the rectification, unwilling to let go and promote democracy, take the lead in standing in the movement, and actively lead and promote the movement to make it more in-depth, but instead stand outside the movement as "bystanders," or suppress the enthusiasm of the masses, and even have erroneous behaviors of treating the movement with a bureaucratic style that suppresses democracy. For example, Ma Nanfeng, Deputy Minister of Finance of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, in a speech at a general meeting of all personnel in his unit on December 29, 1951, criticized the masses: "Don't think that with the arrival of the rectification movement, you can talk and speak recklessly." According to preliminary statistics from the Supply Section of the Finance Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the waste situation in the Finance Department is: small public affairs waste of 233.55 million yuan, temporary advances of more than 1.2 billion yuan, the actual number of people exceeding the authorized establishment by 70 people (estimated at 250 jin of millet per person per month, wasting 151.4 million yuan in half a year), tobacco expenses exceeding more than 10 million yuan, and other expenses such as electric lights, gasoline, and drawing paper exceeding the original regulations by more than 60 million yuan. There are two more cars than stipulated. People who should not bring their families according to regulations have now brought their families. According to the original regulations of the unit, only ministers and accountants can use desks, but in reality, every section chief has a desk. Excessive waste, administrative expenses cannot be reimbursed, so they are reimbursed for financial expenses. When Ma Nanfeng read the written report from the Northwest Region First-Level Organ Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee Inspection Team stationed in the Northwest Military and Political Committee Finance Department to the higher authorities reflecting the above situation, he actually wrote on the written report: "The number of people exceeding the authorized establishment cannot be considered waste, because it is needed for work." "The desks were bought within the approved purchase fee and cannot be called waste." Approving purchase fees, stipulating the number of authorized establishments, and the standards of supply and treatment are necessary for the national financial system, and no department may violate them. However, the Finance Department not only fails to strictly abide by the national financial system but also exceeds the establishment, arbitrarily approves, and uses power to violate the system; and when the masses report it, Ma Nanfeng, as the Deputy Minister of Finance, not only does not make self-criticism but instead defends it, which affects the enthusiasm of the masses and hinders the further deepening of the movement. Ma Nanfeng's very wrong behavior should be immediately inspected and corrected. (Masses Daily)

    西北军政委员会财政部副部长
    马南风压制民主阻碍整风应即纠正
    在以反贪污反浪费反官僚主义为中心内容的整风运动中，西北区一级机关不少领导干部采取了多种方法发扬民主，启发群众检举、检查、坦白，因而暴露了许多问题。但目前仍有一些单位的负责同志对整风采取不正确的态度，不愿放手发扬民主，以身作则地站在运动之中，积极领导和推动运动使它更加深入，而是站在运动之外“袖手旁观”，或压制群众的积极性，甚至有以压制民主的官僚主义作风对待运动的错误行为。如西北军政委员会财政部副部长马南风，于一九五一年十二月二十九日，在本单位全体人员大会的讲话中竟指责群众：“不要以为整风运动来了，就可以乱说乱讲。”据西北军政委员会财政部供给科初步统计，财政部的浪费情况是：小公家务浪费两亿三千三百五十五万元，暂支十二亿多元，实有人数超过编制规定七十人（每人每月按二百五十斤小米开支估计，半年内就要浪费一亿五千一百四十万元），纸烟费超过了一千多万元，其他如电灯、汽油、绘图纸张等开支超过原规定六千多万元。小汽车超过规定两辆。按规定不该带家属的人，现在也带来了家属。按本单位原规定，部长、会计才用写字台，但实际上每个科长都有一个写字台。浪费过多，行政费上报销不了，就向财务费上报销。马南风看了西北区一级机关增产节约委员会驻西北军政委员会财政部检查组给上级反映上述情况的书面报告时，竟在这个书面报告上批写道：“超过编制人数不能算做浪费，因工作需要。”“写字台是在核定的购置费内买的，不能叫做浪费”。核定购置费，规定编制人数和供给待遇标准，是国家财政制度所必需的，任何部门不得违反，而财政部不仅不能严格遵守国家财政制度，反而超出编制，任意批核，利用权力违反制度；而当群众检举时，身为财政部副部长的马南风不但不作检讨，反作辩护，这样就影响了群众的积极性，阻碍了运动的进一步深入。马南风这种非常错误的行为，应即检查纠正。（群众日报）
