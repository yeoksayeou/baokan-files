Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: U.S. President Truman delivered his annual "State of the Union" address to the U.S. Congress on January 9th. This address illustrates that although the U.S. government continues to adhere to its imperialist aggression policy, this policy has encountered increasingly severe setbacks worldwide in the past year, leading U.S. imperialists to become even more lacking in confidence and more anxious about their future.

As with addresses delivered in every election year, Truman's address this year routinely touted his rhetoric about peace and "Fair Deal." However, the actual policy of the U.S. government, as illustrated in Truman's address, is to continue external aggression and coerce the American people into making further sacrifices.

Truman admitted that the Korean armistice is the issue of greatest concern to the American people, but he did not express any intention to change the delaying tactics in the armistice negotiations, announcing that the U.S. government will "continue to fight in Korea" to realize America's unreasonable demands.

Truman also announced the U.S. government's determination to strengthen "military assistance" to anti-popular regimes throughout Asia, to intensify the preparations for war in Western Europe, especially the rearmament of West Germany and Japan. Domestically, Truman said that the first thing to do is to expand military equipment production "at full throttle."

In order to continue to promote this aggression policy, which has been met with obstacles everywhere, Truman announced a new attack on the living standards of the American people. He told the American people that their consumer goods would continue to be "substantially reduced," that "taxes will increase in the coming years," and that they would "have to give up" various welfare programs that were already meager. He specifically told American workers that their wages would continue to be restricted.

In order to salvage the U.S. government's prestige, Truman compiled a long list of so-called "achievements" of U.S. foreign policy in 1951, including the Korean War, which he had already admitted was a failure, the work of organizing the Western European war machine, which he had already expressed disappointment with, and the failures of the U.S. in the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The clumsiness of this kind of lie is so obvious that even Agence France-Presse said that this list "has too many loopholes."

On the other hand, in the "liability" section of the address, Truman had to admit that the U.S. imperialist aggression policy encountered "new difficulties" in 1951. Domestically, military production "encountered difficulties and experienced delays," and the hysterical plans regarding atomic warfare also had "significant weaknesses." Abroad, the U.S. war preparations policy had "caused serious economic problems" in the vassal states of Western Europe, "increased inflation in Europe, and jeopardized the continued recovery of our allies." Like Acheson's New Year's speech, but in a more implicit form, Truman's address acknowledged the serious setbacks the U.S. suffered in the Far East and the Middle East in the past year.

Elsewhere in the address, Truman revealed that the U.S. government is deeply anxious about the serious centrifugal tendencies that occurred within the imperialist camp in 1951 and the increasing isolation of the U.S. Despite Truman's frantic boasting, comparing this year's address with last year's, it is easy to feel that the speaker's tone is much gloomier and his confidence is much more shaken than last year. The dazzling propaganda about the Korean War had to be restrained. The North Atlantic Treaty, which was once heavily publicized, was only occasionally mentioned in this year's address; and the boast about Western European "recovery" under the Marshall Plan was replaced by dark sentences about the crisis in Western Europe under the military equipment plan.

Not only that, but Truman's address also exposed the extremely panicked and ugly state of the U.S. ruling clique in the face of the failure of its aggression policy everywhere. Truman repeatedly called for internal unity and revitalization in the address. He lamented: "Some people are discouraged." He complained: "Every day we see a long line of timid and fearful people wringing their hands and crying out, we are lost—we don't know what we are doing, we are bound to fail." He resentfully scolded: "Now is the time to show courage, not to complain and grumble." He roared: "We must reject the opinions of failure and despair." "If we hesitate and waver, we will fail." He also helplessly cried out: "No matter what we say or do, we are all Americans after all." In order to ease the opposition to his policy and cope with the increasing sense of failure at home, Truman resorted even more to intimidation about the communist threat. But Agence France-Presse pointed out in its commentary: "This is a symbol of the President's unstable position." Although Truman pretended to be calm, he himself was no more confident than other Americans. He admitted that the U.S. was in "a very difficult period. The road seems long and arduous. The goal seems very distant."

Thus, Truman's "State of the Union" address this year clearly shows that U.S. imperialism, which has been faltering in Korea and has suffered varying degrees of failure in all regions of the world, has experienced more serious internal difficulties and chaos, and the U.S. ruling clique has become increasingly confused and disoriented.

### 一年来美国侵略政策遭到愈来愈严重的挫折  杜鲁门“国情咨文”语调阴沉供认困难重重

    一年来美国侵略政策遭到愈来愈严重的挫折
    杜鲁门“国情咨文”语调阴沉供认困难重重
    【新华社十八日讯】美国总统杜鲁门在一月九日向美国国会发表了他一年一度的“国情咨文”。这篇咨文说明：美国政府虽仍继续坚持其帝国主义侵略政策，但由于这一侵略政策在过去一年中在全世界各地遭到愈来愈严重的挫折，已使美帝国主义者对他们的前途更加丧失自信和忧虑不安。
    和在每个选举年发表的咨文一样，杜鲁门今年的咨文照例大吹他的关于和平和“公平施政”的法螺，但是杜鲁门咨文所说明的美国政府的实际政策是：继续对外侵略和强制美国人民作进一步的牺牲。
    杜鲁门承认朝鲜停战是美国人民所最关心的事情，但是他并不表示要改变对停战谈判的拖延战术，宣布美国政府要“继续在朝鲜作战”下去，以实现美国的无理要求。
    杜鲁门也宣布美国政府决心加强对亚洲各地反人民的政权的“军事援助”，加紧西欧的备战，特别是重新武装西德和日本。在国内，杜鲁门说，第一件事就是“开足马力”扩充军备。
    为了继续推行这一已经到处碰壁的侵略政策，杜鲁门宣布了要对美国人民的生活水准发动新的进攻。他告诉美国人民说，他们的消费物品将继续“大量的减少”，“以后几年中税收要提高”，他们将“不得不放弃”已经微乎其微的种种福利事业。他特别告诉美国工人，他们的工资将继续受到限制。
    为了挽救美国政府的威信，杜鲁门开了一大张美国外交政策在一九五一年内获得所谓“成就”的“资产”的清单，把自己都已承认失败的朝鲜战争、自己都已表示失望的组织西欧战争机器的工作以及美国在第六届联合国大会中的失败都列在里面。这种谎言的拙劣如此明显，甚至连法新社都说这个清单“漏洞太多”。
    但是另一方面，在咨文中所举出的“负债”表上，杜鲁门却不得不承认美帝国主义侵略政策在一九五一年遭到了“新困难”。在国内，军备生产“遇到了困难，发生了拖沓”，关于原子战争的歇斯底里的计划也有着“重要弱点”。在国外，美国的备战政策已在西欧仆从国家“引起了严重的经济问题”，“增加了欧洲的通货膨胀并危及了我们盟国的继续复兴”。和艾奇逊的新年演说一样，但是是以更隐晦的形式，杜鲁门的咨文承认美国在远东和中东过去一年中所遭受的严重挫败。
    在咨文的另一地方，杜鲁门透露了，美国政府对于帝国主义阵营内一九五一年中所发生的严重离心倾向和美国的益趋孤立深感焦虑。尽管杜鲁门声嘶力竭地自吹自擂，但拿今年的咨文和去年的比较一下，人们很容易感觉到，说话人的语调是比去年阴沉得多、信心是动摇得多了。关于朝鲜战争的眩耀式的宣传不得不有所收敛。曾经大事张扬的北大西洋公约，今年的咨文只是偶然提到；而关于马歇尔计划下西欧“复兴”的牛皮也为关于军备计划下的西欧危机的阴暗语句所代替了。
    不仅如此，杜鲁门的咨文同时暴露了美国统治集团在侵略政策到处失败下极度慌乱的丑态，杜鲁门在咨文中再三呼吁内部要团结振作。他悲叹说：“有些人气馁了。”他抱怨说：“每天我们都看到一长列胆怯和恐惧的人们搓着手叫道，我们迷路了——我们不知道我们在做什么，我们必定会失败的。”他懊恼地叱责：“现在是需要拿出勇气来的时候，不是抱怨和嘟嚷的时候。”他咆哮：“我们必须排斥失败和绝望的意见。”“如果我们踌躇犹豫，我们便会失败。”他又无可奈何地呼号：“不论说什么做什么，我们大家到底都是美国人。”为了缓和他的政策所遭受的反对和应付国内日益增长的失败情绪，杜鲁门更加诉诸关于共产主义威胁的恫吓。但法新社在评论中指出：“这是总统地位不稳的象征。”杜鲁门虽然故作镇定，实际上自己并不比其他美国人更有信心。他承认美国已处在“一个非常困难的时期。道路看来是漫长而艰苦的。目标看来也遥远得很。”
    这样，杜鲁门今年的“国情咨文”清楚地表明了，在朝鲜一蹶不振而且在全世界各个地区都遭到程度不同的失败的美帝国主义，内部已发生更为严重的困难和混乱，美国的统治集团已愈来愈彷徨失据了。
