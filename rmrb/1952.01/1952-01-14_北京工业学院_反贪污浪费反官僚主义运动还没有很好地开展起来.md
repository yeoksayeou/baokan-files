    Beijing Institute of Technology
    The Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement Has Not Been Well-Launched

    To the Editor: The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement at Beijing Institute of Technology has not yet been launched on a large scale and with vigorous action. The reason is that the leadership has not paid enough attention to this movement and has not boldly mobilized the masses to expose corrupt, wasteful, and bureaucratic elements. The president's mobilization report neither emphasized the importance of this movement nor conducted a deep self-criticism. After the report, many students' thinking remained unclear. Some said, "We don't manage finances, so what does corruption have to do with us?" When we asked the president to make a deep self-criticism, the deputy head of the registration section said to us, "The president has no corruption, waste, or bureaucratic phenomena, what is there for him to criticize?" We believe this statement is incorrect. Leading comrades once mechanically divided this movement into three stages: first, oppose corruption, then oppose waste, and finally oppose bureaucracy. When we pointed out the waste phenomenon to the person in charge of the sports department, they immediately said, "We are mainly opposing corruption now, don't disrupt our steps." Therefore, the movement has always been limited to "anti-corruption." The president and the secretary of the Party's general branch also said, "Now, mobilizing students to participate in this movement, we are afraid it will affect the students' studies, we must ask the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government for instructions." Therefore, many people still have the wrong idea of "students' exams first, anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement second." As far as we know, our school not only has corruption phenomena, but also many other problems. For example, in terms of leadership work, since 1948, there have been phenomena of disunity and disputes. There are also shortcomings in the implementation of cadre policies. We believe that these problems should be solved quickly.

    北京工业学院
    反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动还没有很好地开展起来
    编辑同志：北京工业学院反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动，直到现在还没有大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地展开。原因是领导方面没有重视这个运动，没有大胆地发动群众，检举贪污、浪费、官僚主义分子。院长的动员报告，既没有强调这个运动的重要性，又没有进行深刻的自我检讨。报告过后，许多同学的思想依旧没有打通。有的说：“咱又不管理财政，贪污和咱有什么关系？”我们要求院长作深刻检讨时，注册科副科长这样对我们说：“院长又没有贪污、浪费和官僚主义的现象，你让他检讨什么？”我们认为，这种说法是不正确的。领导同志曾经机械地把这个运动分成三个阶段：先反对贪污，再反对浪费，最后反对官僚主义。当我们向体育室负责人指出浪费现象时，他们马上就说：“我们现在主要是反对贪污，你们不要打乱我们的步骤。”所以运动始终局限于“反贪污”这一点上。院长和党的总支书记也曾这样说：“现在发动同学参加这个运动，怕会影响同学们的学习，要请示中央人民政府教育部才行。”因此，很多人还有“学生考试第一，反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动第二”的错误思想。就我们所知，我校不只有贪污现象，其他方面的问题也是很多的。例如在领导工作方面，自一九四八年以来，就发生过闹不团结、闹纠纷的现象。在执行干部政策方面也是有缺点的。我们认为对这些问题都应该赶快解决。
