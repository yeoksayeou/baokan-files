Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editor: On December 10th of last year, People's Daily reader Xu Bingzhong raised concerns about the imbalanced arrival of vehicles at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant under our ministry, which affected production. We believe this opinion is correct. Goods from more than twenty stations across the country need to be transported to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. The distances from various locations to Shijingshan vary, which objectively can easily lead to fluctuating amounts arriving at the destination. However, we did not adequately grasp this situation and did not proactively contact the mines. Our advance notifications were also not timely, which caused difficulties in unloading the vehicles. In addition to paying attention to inspection and supervision, we have instructed the relevant railway bureaus to effectively liaise with the consignors to achieve balanced dispatch. We have also instructed the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau Director to consult with the responsible cadres of the mines to shorten the time vehicles stay at the mines, to ensure increased production efficiency and achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy.

### 铁道部运输总局对调拨车辆不平衡的答复

    铁道部运输总局对调拨车辆不平衡的答复
    编辑同志：去年十二月十日，人民日报读者徐炳忠对我部到达石景山钢铁厂的车辆很不平衡，因而影响了生产的事情，提出意见；我们认为这个意见是正确的。全国各地有二十多个车站的货物，要运到石景山钢铁厂，各地到达石景山的距离远近不等，客观上容易产生到达终点时忽多忽少的情况。但我们没有很好地掌握这一情况，没有主动地和矿山方面联系，预报也不及时，因此造成卸车的困难。我们除了注意检查督促外，已指示各有关路局，切实和发货人联系，做到平衡发送；并责成北京铁路分局长和矿山方面的负责干部洽商，缩短车辆在矿山停留时间，保证提高生产效率，达到增产节约的目的。
