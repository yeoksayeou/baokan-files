    We must be vigilant and repel the attack of the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets
    Editor: After reading Comrade Bo Yibo's report "Strive to thoroughly and universally carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement," I thought of the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan incident in Tianjin Special District.
    When the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan incident was announced, I was surprised. Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were veteran cadres who had participated in the revolution for a long time. They had fought heroically against the enemy, and they had made certain contributions to the revolution. So, why did Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan degenerate? I temporarily came to a conclusion: Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were essentially too bad. But then I thought, if they were "essentially too bad," how could they have been "long-tested" in the past? I couldn't figure it out.
    Comrade Bo Yibo's report pointed out that Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were destroyed by the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets. I began to realize: Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan were indeed essentially too bad, but more importantly, they encountered a more terrible and more vicious enemy today—the corrupt and decadent ideology of the bourgeoisie. They were unable to pass this test, they were hit by the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets, and "destroyed by these sugar-coated bullets!"
    Comrade Bo Yibo pointed out that some people "do not advocate simplicity and hard work in life, but instead learn to be extravagant and pleasure-seeking." People like this (including myself) are probably not a minority. Therefore, I deeply realize that if we are not vigilant and do not repel the attack of the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets, then there is a danger of the Party and the country being destroyed.　Huang Lai

    我们要警惕和打退资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻
    编辑同志：读了薄一波同志“为深入地普遍地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动而斗争”的报告后，我又想起了天津专区刘青山、张子善事件。
    刘青山、张子善事件发表时，我很惊讶。刘青山、张子善是参加革命很久的老干部。他们曾经英勇地对敌斗争，他们对革命有过一定的功劳。那末，刘青山、张子善为什么变质了呢？我暂时得出一个结论：刘青山、张子善本质太坏。但又想，他们既然“本质太坏”，过去如何能“久经考验”？我想不通。
    薄一波同志的报告指出，刘青山、张子善是被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹毁灭了的。我开始认识到：刘青山、张子善固然本质太坏，但更重要的是他们在今天遇到了更可怕、更毒辣的敌人——资产阶级的腐化堕落思想。他们没有能够过这一关，他们被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹打中了，“被这糖衣炮弹毁灭了”！
    薄一波同志指出，有一些人“在生活上不是提倡简朴刻苦，而是学习铺张享乐”。像这样的人（连我在内），恐怕不是少数。因此，我深深体会到：如果我们不警惕和打退资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻，那就有亡党、亡国的危险。　黄来
