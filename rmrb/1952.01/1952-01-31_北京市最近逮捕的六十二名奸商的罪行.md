Beijing Municipal People's Government has, from January 25th to 30th, legally arrested sixty-two unscrupulous merchants from fifty-two factories and stores who committed serious crimes such as bribery, tax evasion, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state property, and who still refused to confess during the inspection by the Beijing Municipal Committee for Frugality Examination. The crimes of these unscrupulous merchants that have been uncovered are announced as follows:

    Dong Zizhang, manager of Qixin Rubber Factory, is a representative of the industrial and commercial circles of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, as well as a member of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the director of the Rubber Industry Association. However, in his business dealings, he exhausted all means of theft and did not resemble a people's representative at all. Dong committed the crime of stealing and defrauding state property and delaying military supplies by consistently using despicable methods such as shoddy workmanship, using defective goods to pass off as good ones, and stealing surplus materials in several instances of undertaking national military orders. It has now been found that Dong committed three bad deeds in 1951 alone: In March, when undertaking the production of raincoats for the North China Military Region, he stole raw materials worth approximately 50 million yuan and bribed the inspector of the department to pass off defective goods as good ones, causing the state to lose approximately 84 million yuan. In June, when undertaking the production of more than 800 rolls of rubberized fabric for the Central Trade Department, he cut corners and stole surplus materials totaling more than 110 million yuan. In addition, he cut corners on more than 6,000 tires made for the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, worth approximately 50 million yuan. According to the preliminary results of the current audit, the tax evasion is nearly 400 million yuan. When the inspection team went to inspect, Dong was very stubborn and refused to confess his illegal activities, either saying he "can't remember" or "there is no such thing."
    Zhang Zhiliang, manager of Qingyuanlong Hardware Store, bribed more than 20 staff members. According to the findings, the bribes in currency alone amounted to more than 62 million yuan. As a result, the tax evasion committed by the culprit amounted to more than 448 million yuan, and the state property stolen through shoddy workmanship is estimated to be nearly 60 million yuan. After the start of this movement, the culprit held several meetings with the store's employees and the staff of the bribed organs, and personally went to Tianjin to consult with relevant merchants to arrange strategies to resist the movement. He was also extremely cunning when the inspection team conducted the inspection, refusing to confess.
    Zhang Shengsan, manager of Zhongxing Construction Factory, in June 1949, when contracting the grain warehouse outside Yongdingmen, defrauded public funds and official letters to purchase 21 train cars of timber from the Northeast (at a time when the government strictly prohibited the entry of Northeast timber into the customs), stealing and defrauding more than 420 million yuan from it. The culprit has consistently colluded with cadres, stolen bid prices, and cut corners when contracting projects. For example, the roof of the aforementioned grain warehouse was not properly covered, and it leaked whenever it rained; he did eight projects for the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau, and the bid prices for all eight projects were stolen by him in advance. He also evaded more than 33 million yuan in state taxes. After the launch of this movement, the culprit entered into a so-called "offensive and defensive alliance" with accomplice merchants and hid and destroyed account books.
    Zhang Yuhua, manager of Qinghuaxing Electrical Materials Store, worked in the puppet electrical bureau in 1937 and consistently stole materials, subcontracted work, and resold electrical materials. He opened this business in 1946. After liberation, he was retained by the Electrical Bureau and continued to steal state property without restraint. Over the past three years, Zhang has bribed more than 30 staff members of the Electrical Bureau and other units, stealing and defrauding state property and evading taxes totaling more than 180 million yuan through illegal activities such as stealing public materials, cutting corners, and reselling electric meters. After committing these illegal acts, Zhang resigned in fear of punishment in October last year when all cadres in the city were studying to be loyal and honest. After the start of this movement, he was afraid that his crimes would be exposed and went everywhere to "collude."
    Dong He, manager of Xiehexing Construction Factory, and Liu Dongguo, associate manager, stole state property and obtained illegal profits. In contracting projects, they used methods such as cutting corners and falsely reporting wages to cause state property losses of approximately 488 million yuan. In doing a certain project alone, cutting corners caused the state to lose more than 228 million yuan. Dong and Liu also used subcontracting to obtain materials, causing the state to lose more than 158 million yuan according to the findings. In addition, the factory forged accounts and engaged in serious tax evasion. According to the existing materials, preliminary calculations show that the tax evasion is more than 258 million yuan. After the start of this movement, the two culprits not only did not confess their serious crimes of stealing state property, but also dared to threaten employees, saying: "Whoever reports me must produce the facts. I would rather fight him to the death." When the inspection team went to the factory to inspect, Dong and Liu still refused to confess and attempted to deny it.
    Dong Shijie, manager of Jingda Iron Factory, bribed more than ten staff members of our military organs with gold, radios, pens, watches, and other items. The value of the bribes was more than 100 million yuan. Dong repeatedly defrauded a military organ of train cars to transport his goods for free and evaded taxes. The culprit also bought 5,600 52-gallon oil drums from a military organ at a low price and then sold them to another military organ at a high price, earning an illegal profit of more than 438 million yuan. He also consistently engaged in business as a peddler while registered as a shopkeeper, evading a lot of taxes. The peddler's tax alone amounted to more than 68 million yuan. After the start of this movement, the culprit dispersed bank deposits, gave his first wife and second wife more than 100 million yuan each, and sent them to Tianjin; on the other hand, he tried every means to deny it, trying to escape this "checkpoint."
    Zhang Yunfeng, deputy manager of Deji Trading Company, amid the high tide of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, lost all conscience and bribed staff members of state-owned enterprises, misappropriating a large number of train cars to transport timber privately, from which he obtained huge profits and caused great losses to the state. In order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, Zhang bribed staff members of more than ten units with more than 97 million yuan through means such as borrowing money and treating guests. Zhang also used the huge profits obtained from illegal operations to resell gold and disrupt the market. It has been found that he resold 540 taels of gold. According to preliminary statistics, the company evaded more than 300 million yuan in taxes. When the inspection team went to the company to inspect, Zhang not only refused to confess but also behaved like a hooligan to the inspection team.
    Qi Canghai, manager of Jingdu Automobile Repair and Maintenance Factory, devised various despicable means to seduce staff members. It has been found that 50 staff members from 27 units were dragged into the water by Qi, and the total amount of bribes reached more than 31 million yuan. There are as many as 14 ways to bribe. A platoon leader of a certain unit often went to Jingdu to repair cars, so Qi used the method of introducing girlfriends and deliberately losing money in playing cards to drag the platoon leader into the water. The chief of the traffic section of a certain unit had only one hand, and it was inconvenient for him to wear a watch, so Qi gave him an automatic watch. Qi wantonly plundered state property through these bribed elements. The methods were also various, such as stealing parts, selling fake goods, using bad goods to replace good ones, stealing and selling gasoline, cutting corners, and saying that parts were replaced when they were not. The preliminary statistics show that the theft of state property reached more than 24 million yuan. In addition, Qi also illegally resold cars and evaded state taxes. In 1951 alone, the tax evasion amounted to more than 17 million yuan.
    Nie Baozhu, manager of Luda Iron Factory, was introduced by a private individual in the spring of 1950 and mixed into the public Lihua Company to work. He bribed cadres and used Lihua's name to carry out his despicable act of stealing state property. Over the past two years, Nie has bribed 14 staff members with more than 20 million yuan; he has stolen more than 200 million yuan of state property from public enterprises and organs, and evaded more than 1 billion yuan in taxes.
    Shi Kun, manager of Zhongli Telephone Equipment Manufacturing Factory, in order to achieve the goal of stealing state property, used various despicable means to attack state cadres. Over the past three years, he has bribed more than ten cadres with more than 56 million yuan. The director of a certain department of the Tianjin Railway Administration had dealings with Zhongli, so Shi Kun took the opportunity to launch an offensive. In addition to inviting him to dinner, giving him money, and giving him a house, he even used prostitutes to win over the director, calling him brother and stealing a large amount of state property. He has bribed the director with a total of more than 26 million yuan. Shi cut corners, causing the state to suffer losses that cannot be calculated. He sold 60 electric motors to a certain unit, 54 of which were waste products, causing the state to lose more than 370 million yuan. The factory evaded more than 250 million yuan in taxes and illegally resold more than 100 taels of gold. After the start of this movement, Shi has refused to confess.
    Liu Rongjiang, manager of Xinxing Pharmacy, and Niu Fengming, deputy manager, consistently manufactured and sold fake drugs and drugs. When the inspection team inspected the pharmacy, they found a large number of drugs such as ten pounds of caffeine and 300 boxes of morphine injections. The illegal profits obtained by the culprit from selling fake drugs alone are nearly 1.6 billion yuan. At the same time, they also used illegal means such as creating false accounts and engaging in off-book activities to evade state taxes. According to the statistical data on the books, the tax evasion is nearly 60 million yuan. After the launch of this movement, the culprit burned a large number of account books in order to deny it and refused to confess.
    Dong Jinhai, a shareholder of Tianlide Tin and Lead Smelting Factory, has evaded huge amounts of taxes over the past three years. Preliminary calculations show that the amount is more than 500 million yuan. Dong often bribed cadres by giving kickbacks and reporting false prices. It has now been found that there are 25 cases, totaling 12.31 million yuan. After he colluded with the staff of the organ, he asked them to steal lead, antimony, tin, and other items from the organ and sell them to him at a low price. It has now been found that there are eight cases, totaling 490 pounds of lead and nearly 100 pounds of tin and antimony.
    Guo Yantang, deputy manager of Tonghexinji Construction Factory, colluded with unscrupulous merchants who had mixed into public enterprises to steal machines and materials from public enterprises worth approximately 233.4 million yuan, and also won over staff to misappropriate 50 million yuan of public funds, which was reported as the factory's funds in order to deceive the government. In contracting projects, the factory stole bid prices five times, and cut corners and stole state equipment. It has been found that the amount is more than 9.6 million yuan. The factory evaded more than 16 million yuan in taxes and violated the cash management system, illegally obtaining cash seven times for a public enterprise, amounting to more than 180 million yuan.
    Liu Chengmo, manager of Yongtai Construction Factory (sold to the Central Textile Industry Department in July 1951 and reorganized into the Engineering Department of the public Xinmin Company), and Han Zongzhi, Dong Zhuochao, and Liu Yi, deputy managers, were all heinous unscrupulous merchants. They consistently corrupted state cadres, evaded state taxes, and stole a large amount of state property. The culprits used many tricks to corrupt cadres, such as inviting them to dinner, watching dramas, visiting parks, giving cash, and giving rice and flour. In total, they bribed 15 staff members of ten units with more than 19 million yuan. According to the accounts, they stole more than 2.2 billion yuan of state property in just two projects. The culprits also used methods such as privately creating receipts, falsely reporting accounts, and not recording sales to evade taxes, totaling more than 240 million yuan.
    Zang Jindong, manager of Yili Construction Factory, bribed staff members of the organ and used methods such as cutting corners and reporting more than less to seize illegal profits in subcontracting, worth more than 200 million yuan. The bribery of Yan Bensong, a staff member of the former Construction Bureau, alone amounted to more than 19 million yuan (Yan has been arrested). The culprit stole state project bid prices more than ten times, causing the state to lose nearly 300 million yuan. After the start of this movement, Zang hid the true accounts, fabricated false accounts, dispersed cash, and sent workers home; at the same time, he and the bribed Yan Bensong entered into an "offensive and defensive alliance," agreeing that no one would speak. Even when the inspection team went to inspect, he refused to confess.
    Sun Changlin, manager of Defeng Motor Vehicle Company, has consistently colluded with staff members since liberation, using inferior goods to replace good ones and subcontracting projects to profit from them. According to the findings, Sun has won over 17 cadres with bribes of more than 12 million yuan and stolen more than 22 million yuan of state property. In 1950 alone, the company evaded taxes on a turnover of 140 million yuan. After the start of this movement, Sun was stubborn and refused to confess. In order to evade the movement, he went to Dongshengxiang Oil and Salt Store to be the manager, trying to get through the "checkpoint."
    Zhang Yingqi, deputy manager of Qiye Wood Factory, who presided over the factory's business, has consistently bribed cadres and stolen state property by giving furniture and issuing more invoices. According to preliminary statistics, Zhang has bribed cadres with at least 16 million yuan and stolen nearly 160 million yuan of state property. In addition to the 16 million yuan of tax evasion recorded on the books, in 1950, he received more than 420 million yuan of payment from the public Yigongyi Wood Factory, all of which were not affixed with stamps, and half of which were not recorded in the accounts. The amount of tax evasion is impossible to calculate.
    Liu Gengbai, manager of Dexin Factory, cut corners and stole property in undertaking military orders. According to the statistics of two batches of orders, he stole illegal profits of more than 368 million yuan. According to incomplete materials, Liu bribed 11 staff members with more than 5.3 million yuan, evaded more than 19.3 million yuan in taxes, and illegally operated timber and hardware with more than 200 million yuan of funds.
    Jiang Wenzhang, deputy manager of Yongxing Construction Factory, had a capital of only 20 million yuan when he opened in 1950. In the past two years, he has done more than 10 billion yuan of projects. Due to cutting corners and evading taxes, he has obtained huge illegal profits. In order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, he has bribed more than ten staff members, amounting to more than 77 million yuan. When he contracted the construction base project of the training base, as a result of bribing six staff members, he was able to use his usual trick of cutting corners, causing the state property to lose about 1 billion yuan. According to preliminary statistics, he has evaded more than 17.5 million yuan in taxes in the past two years. (To be continued)

    从本月二十五日到三十日，北京市人民政府依法逮捕了犯有严重的行贿、偷税、偷工减料、盗窃国家资财等罪行，而在北京市节约检查委员会进行检查时仍拒不坦白的五十二家厂、店的奸商六十二名。兹将这些奸商已被检查出来的罪行，公布如下：
    企新橡胶厂经理董子璋，是北京市各界人民代表会议工商界代表，又是市工商业联合会委员、橡胶业同业公会主任委员，但是他在做买卖时，却耍尽盗窃伎俩，完全不像一个人民代表。董犯在数次承做国家军事定货时，一贯以偷工减料、残货充好货、窃取结余物资等卑鄙手段，盗骗国家资财，遗误军需。现在查明的，董犯在一九五一年就接连做了三件坏事：三月，承做华北军区雨衣时，窃取原料约值五千万元，并贿赂该部验货员，以残货充好货，使国家损失约八千四百余万元。六月，承做中央贸易部胶布八百多匹，偷工减料，并窃取结余物资总值一亿一千多万元。另外，给华北军区后勤部做车胎六千余条，偷工减料约值五千万元。据目前初步查账结果，偷漏的税款近四亿元。当检查组前往检查时，董犯还十分顽抗，对自己的不法行为，不是说“想不起来”，就是说“没有”，拒不坦白。
