    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    The University on Lenin Hills
    For us, the builders of the new campus of Moscow State University on Lenin Hills, the past year has been a year of great and intense labor. We have essentially completed the construction of this enormous palace of science.
    The new campus of Moscow State University is a great construction of the Stalin era. It suffices to point out these few facts: the main building is over 240 meters high, the roof is adorned with a 52-meter-high spire topped with a giant star; the entire university includes more than 30 buildings, with a total volume of over 2 million cubic meters; the metal framework of the main building alone weighs 38,000 tons.
    In 1951, more than 20,000 various technical workers participated in the construction of the new campus of Moscow University. As for the speed of construction, it can be seen from the fact that we often received 300 railcars of materials and equipment per day and night.
    Currently, fitting-out work is progressing rapidly on various university buildings, with the installation of many highly complex instruments and machinery. It should be pointed out that most of the equipment we receive is not ordinary products but is specially ordered by the university.
    In the new campus of Moscow University, there will be six faculties, in which 7,100 undergraduates will study and 900 graduate students will engage in scientific work.
    Undergraduates and scientific workers will have very fine studies, laboratories, museums, libraries, and dormitories. In short, they will have everything necessary for effective study and scientific work.
    On September 1, 1952, Moscow State University will begin classes at the new campus. (Written by Alexei Voronkov, Director of Construction of the New Campus of Moscow State University, USSR)
    Mass Publication of Marxist-Leninist Books in Poland
    Classical Marxist-Leninist books in Polish have been published in large quantities in Poland. Eleven volumes of Lenin's Collected Works have been published, with a total circulation of 2.25 million copies. Ten volumes of Stalin's Collected Works have been published, with a total circulation of 2.5 million copies. The Short Course on the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) has been published in three editions, with a total circulation of 1.35 million copies.
    Reconstruction of the Bulgarian Capital
    At the end of 1951, the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Bulgaria approved a resolution on the reconstruction of the city of Sofia.
    According to this plan, the central square, boulevards, and streets will be greatly expanded, and a large number of offices and residences, theaters, cinemas, and shops will be built. Streets and squares will be greened, and many small gardens will be built in the center of intersections.
    On "September 9th" Square, which has almost doubled in size, new buildings for the Council of Ministers, the National Opera House, the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Electricity, and the majestic Stalin Monument will be built.
    The plan envisages the construction of a sixteen-story building – the Palace of the Soviets, in front of which the Dimitrov Monument will be erected. On the greatly expanded Lenin Square, a Lenin Monument will be erected.
    Sofia's public economy will be improved. The city's transportation network will be expanded several times.
    According to the planned plan for the reconstruction of the city of Sofia, the total value of all projects will reach eight billion leva.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    列宁山上的大学
    对于我们这些国立莫斯科大学在列宁山上的新校舍的建筑者来说，过去的一年是伟大而紧张的劳动的一年。我们已基本上完成了这个巨大科学宫的建筑工作。
    国立莫斯科大学的新校舍，是斯大林时代的一个伟大建筑。我们只须指出这几点就足以说明了：主要建筑物高达二百四十公尺以上，屋顶上装饰有五十二公尺高的顶端有一个巨星的尖塔；全部大学包括三十多座建筑，它的总体积在二百万立方公尺以上；仅仅一个主要建筑物所用的金属骨架的重量，就有三万八千吨。
    一九五一年，参加莫斯科大学新校舍建筑工作的有二万多个各种技术工人。至于建筑进行的速度怎样，由我们时常一昼夜收到的材料和设备达三百辆车皮一事，就可以看出来了。
    现在，大学的各项建筑上正在以很快的速度进行装配工作，安装着许多非常复杂的用具和机械。应该指出，我们所收到的大部分装备，都不是普通产品，而是由大学专门订制的。
    在莫斯科大学的新校舍中，将有六个学院，其中将有七千一百名大学生学习，有九百名研究生从事科学工作。
    大学生和科学工作者们，将拥有非常精美的书房、实验室、博物馆、图书馆和宿舍。简单说来，他们将获得为了有成效的学习和科学工作所必需的一切。
    一九五二年的九月一日，国立莫斯科大学便将在新校址开始上课了。（苏联国立莫斯科大学新校舍建筑主任阿列克赛·沃龙科夫作）
    马克思列宁主义书籍在波兰大量出版
    波兰文的马克思列宁主义经典书籍已在波兰大量出版。列宁全集已出了十一卷，共发行二百二十五万册。斯大林全集已出十卷，共发行二百五十万册。联共（布）党史简明教程已出三版，共发行一百三十五万册。
    保加利亚首都的重建
    一九五一年年底，保加利亚人民共和国部长会议和保加利亚共产党中央委员会，通过了关于重建索非亚城的决议。
    按照这个计划，中央广场、林荫路和街道将大大扩展，机关和住宅、戏院、电影院、商店等将大量建筑起来，街道和广场将被绿化起来，十字路口中央都要建设许多小花园。
    在几乎扩大了一倍的“九九”广场上，将要建设部长会议、国家歌剧院、重工业部和电力部的新建筑物和雄伟的斯大林纪念碑。
    计划中，预定要建立一个十六层大厦——苏维埃宫，在宫前将要建立季米特洛夫纪念碑。在大大扩展了的列宁广场上，将竖立起列宁纪念碑。
    索非亚城的公营经济将获得改善。城市交通网将扩大好几倍。
    按照重建索非亚城的预定计划，全部工程的总值共达八十亿利瓦（保币）。
