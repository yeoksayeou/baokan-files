Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: The Central People's Government Ministry of Trade and its fourteen affiliated specialized companies and general corporations held a general meeting of all staff members on the 20th to fight against Xue Kunshan, who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and stole state property, and Zhuang Zhifang, Liu Yun, and others, major embezzlers who refused to confess. Everyone angrily denounced their crimes of stealing state property and unanimously demanded that the government punish them according to law.

Xue Kunshan was originally a merchant in Zhangjiakou with only 200 bolts of cloth as capital. In 1945, he formed a joint venture with Zhangjiakou Trading Company, called Fuyihe Fur Shop, with a 15% share. After the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, the fur shop was closed in 1950. Xue Kunshan infiltrated the China Fur Company and later served as Deputy Director of the Business Section of the China Animal Products Company. During the joint operation of Fuyihe Fur Shop, Xue committed the crime of purchasing 3 million jin of cashmere on behalf of the Fur Company, mixing mud into the cashmere, and bribing buyers Ma Zifeng, Zhu Fengming, and others to defraud state property. In addition, he organized collective embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds, defrauding state property of more than 2 billion yuan in total. Xue used the embezzled funds to open or invest in fur shops in Baotou, Zhangjiakou, Beijing, and Tianjin. He also used his authority to steal state secrets, directing the commercial firms he opened or invested in to manipulate the market and engage in speculation. For example, in June 1951, the company decided to increase the price of camel hair by 20%. That evening, Zhangjiakou Deyiheng Fur Shop, in which Xue had invested, bought 32,000 jin of old camel hair from the Inner Mongolia Trading Company. When the Zhangjiakou Trading Company received the instruction, the camel hair had already been bought up. Xue stole a huge amount of state wealth from embezzlement and speculation, and currently has 19 commercial firms that he operates and invests in, and 1.35 billion yuan deposited in banks and commercial firms in various places (not including those that have not been investigated). When the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began, Xue secretly convened the managers of the commercial firms he invested in Beijing and Tianjin to make emergency arrangements to resist the movement. During the movement, despite several mobilizations, he still refused to confess and attempted to escape with deposit checks.

Attendees also angrily denounced Zhuang Zhifang, the team leader of the Taiyuan Engineering Team of the Capital Construction Engineering Department of the Ministry of Trade, who refused to confess his embezzlement. Chang Gengsheng, a clerk in the engineering department, revealed that Zhuang colluded with private merchants to steal state property amounting to 500 million yuan, causing huge losses to state property. For example, the Taiyuan Equipment Warehouse project was originally contracted by the China Construction Company, but Zhuang, because of his collusion with unscrupulous merchants from Daye Construction Factory, insisted on having the factory contract the project, causing a loss of 350 million yuan to state property. In addition to accusing Zhuang of his crimes, Chang Gengsheng confessed that under Zhuang's influence, he had accepted bribes from private merchants, amounting to more than 2 million yuan of embezzlement.

Among the embezzlers who were struggled against was Liu Yun, the Chief of the Storage and Transportation Section of the China Oils and Fats Company, who joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1940. Liu, unable to withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, betrayed the Party and the people, accepted bribes from unscrupulous merchants, sold market information, and helped unscrupulous merchants engage in speculation. After the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began, the Party branch mobilized him seven times to confess, but he refused to accept. The Party Committee of the Ministry of Trade announced on the spot the expulsion of Liu Yun from the Party.

The masses at the meeting also conducted struggles against Sun Qingtang, the mess hall operator of the China Department Store, and Yang Daqi, a clerk of the General Affairs Section of the Engineering Department, who resisted the movement and refused to confess. Xu Lan, the cashier of the mess hall of the China Department Store, in addition to confessing her own embezzlement, also accused Sun Qingtang of enticing and encouraging her to embezzle and preventing her from confessing.

During the accusations against the various criminals, the emotions of the masses in the audience were very激昂 (jī'áng, high-spirited and impassioned), and angry slogans rose one after another. They unanimously demanded that the government severely punish the major embezzlers and illegal merchants who refused to confess and resisted the movement. Many people asked to take the stage to accuse and confess on the spot.

Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Trade, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out: Judging from the acts of collusion between several major embezzlers and private merchants revealed today, and especially from the situation where the unscrupulous merchant Xue Kunshan directly infiltrated the revolutionary ranks to carry out activities, the bourgeoisie is constantly attacking our state trade departments, and has already caused huge losses to state property. We must repel this attack by the bourgeoisie, and the unscrupulous merchants and embezzlers who have infiltrated our ranks, used their authority, and stolen state property must be severely punished by the court. At the same time, Ye Jizhuang announced that although Xu Lan and Chang Gengsheng had committed embezzlement, they were able to confess to the masses and report other embezzlers, making amends for their crimes, and should be exempted from legal punishment. Other embezzlers who confessed in public will also have their punishment reduced. He called on all embezzlers to take Xu Lan and Chang Gengsheng as examples, thoroughly confess, and earnestly report. All trade workers should continue to wage a resolute struggle against embezzlers who refuse to confess and resist the movement, carry out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to the end, and resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attack!

    中央贸易部全体工作人员举行大会
    斗争混入国营经济机关的奸商
    彻底揭发薛崑山庄志芳等五犯的罪行
    【新华社二十一日讯】中央人民政府贸易部和所属十四个专业公司总公司的全体工作人员在二十日举行大会，斗争混入革命队伍盗窃国家财产的薛崑山和拒不坦白的大贪污分子庄志芳、刘云等人。大家愤怒地控诉了他们盗窃国家财产的罪行，一致要求政府依法惩办。
    薛崑山本是张家口市一个只有二百匹布资本的商人，一九四五年曾以百分之十五的股份和张家口贸易公司合营福义和皮毛栈。北京、天津解放后，该皮毛栈在一九五○年结束，薛崑山混进了中国皮毛公司，后来又充任中国畜产公司业务处副处长。在合营福义和皮毛栈期间，薛犯代皮毛公司收购绒毛三百万斤，在绒毛内搀杂泥土，并贿赂收买人马子风、朱凤鸣等骗取国家财产。此外又组织集体贪污，套用公款，前后共骗取国家财产二十亿元以上。薛犯以贪污所得资金，在包头、张家口、北京、天津开设或投资皮毛栈，并利用职权窃取国家机密，指挥自己开设、投资的商号，操纵市场，投机倒把。如一九五一年六月，公司决定提高驼毛价格百分之二十。当晚薛犯所投资的张家口德义恒皮毛栈就收买了内蒙贸易公司旧存驼毛三万二千斤。当张家口市贸易公司接到指示后，驼毛已被收购一空。薛犯从贪污和投机倒把中盗窃了国家的巨额财富，目前已有自己经营和投资的商号十九家，并在各地银行、商号存款十三亿五千万元（未调查清楚的还不在内）。当反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，薛犯曾秘密召集北京、天津他所投资的商号经理做紧急布置以抵抗运动。在运动中，虽经几次动员，但他仍拒不坦白，并企图携带存款支票逃跑。
    到会者还愤怒地控诉了拒不坦白的贪污分子、曾任贸易部基本建设工程处太原工程队队长的庄志芳。工程处事务员常更生等揭发庄犯勾结私商盗窃国家财产达五亿元，使国家财产遭受了巨大的损失。如太原器材仓库工程，原由中国建筑公司承包，但庄犯因和大业营造厂的奸商有勾结，硬要让该厂承包，使国家财产损失了三亿五千万元。常更生除控诉庄犯罪行外，并坦白出自己在庄犯的影响下曾经接受私商贿赂二百多万元的贪污行为。
    被斗争的贪污分子中，还有一九四○年就参加中国共产党的中国油脂公司储运科长刘云。刘犯因为经不起糖衣炮弹的攻击，叛变了党和人民，接受了奸商贿赂，出卖行情，帮助奸商投机倒把。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，党支部七次动员他坦白，他都不接受。中共贸易部党委会当场宣布开除刘云的党籍。
    大会群众同时向抵抗运动拒不坦白的贪污分子、中国百货公司伙食经营人孙庆棠、工程处总务科科员杨达骐进行了斗争。中国百货公司伙食团出纳徐兰除了坦白自己的贪污事实外，并控诉孙庆棠引诱和鼓励她贪污，并阻止她坦白的罪行。
    在对各犯控诉时，全场群众情绪十分激昂，愤怒的口号此起彼落，一致要求政府严办拒不坦白、抵抗运动的大贪污分子和不法奸商。许多人要求上台控诉和当场坦白。
    贸易部部长叶季壮在大会上讲了话。他指出：从今天揭发的几个大贪污分子勾结私商、盗窃国家资财的行为看来，特别是从奸商薛崑山直接混入革命队伍进行活动的情形看来，资产阶级是不断地向我们的国家贸易部门进攻的，而且已经使国家财产遭受到巨大损失。我们必须打退资产阶级这种进攻，对混进我们队伍，利用职权，盗窃国家财产的这种奸商和贪污分子，必须交法院严厉制裁。同时，叶季壮宣布徐兰和常更生虽有贪污行为，但能向群众坦白并能检举别的贪污分子，将功赎罪，应免予法律处分。其余当众坦白的贪污分子也都将减轻处分。他号召所有贪污分子要以徐兰和常更生为榜样，彻底坦白，认真检举。全体贸易工作人员要继续和拒不坦白抵抗运动的贪污分子进行坚决斗争，把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动贯彻到底，坚决打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻！
