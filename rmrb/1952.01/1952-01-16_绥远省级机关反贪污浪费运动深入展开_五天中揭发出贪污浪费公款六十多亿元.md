    The Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Campaign in Suiyuan Provincial Organs Deepens
    More Than 6 Billion Yuan in Embezzled and Wasted Public Funds Uncovered in Five Days
    Under the personal leadership of Yang Zhilin, Vice Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in various provincial units of Suiyuan has achieved significant results. On December 30th of last year, after Yang Zhilin, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, made a mobilization report to cadres of the provincial and municipal organs on continuing to carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, he also made a painful and serious self-criticism at the joint meeting of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee, the Provincial People's Government Committee, and the Standing Committee of the Provincial Consultative Committee. Subsequently, the heads of various departments, offices, and bureaus mostly made public self-criticisms and self-examinations among the masses. At this time, the broad masses of cadres also saw the People's Daily editorial on January 4th, "In the Great Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy, What is the Key to Mobilizing the Masses?" This further increased their confidence and courage in fighting corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. They said: "We now know that not only is our Provincial Government Vice Chairman backing us up, but Chairman Mao is also backing us up. We must break through our worries and resolutely fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and boldly expose and report them." With the increasing enthusiasm of the masses, after Song Pixian, Director of the Suiyuan Provincial Cooperative, made three self-examinations, twenty people voluntarily confessed to their acts of corruption within two days. After the two directors of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry made mobilizations, sixteen people immediately took the stage to speak, one of whom exposed the crime of Wang Guojie, the person in charge of the Min Dong Canal project, who embezzled and wasted more than 200 million yuan during the construction of the Min Dong Canal. The masses of the Provincial People's Government Office exposed the crime of Xing Juye, Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the Office, who embezzled more than 140 million yuan. From January 3rd to 8th, in just five days, preliminary statistics from the materials exposed by the provincial organs alone showed that public funds embezzled and wasted amounted to more than 6 billion yuan.
    In order to carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign to the end, and in order to further mobilize the masses, the leadership of Suiyuan Province has accepted the demands of the masses and arrested and brought to justice four corrupt elements who refused to confess: Xing Juye (Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the Provincial People's Government), Lü Zibin (cadre of the Provincial People's Government Taxation Bureau, formerly Deputy Director of the Shaanba Special Commissioner's Office Taxation Bureau), Zhao Shide (cadre of the Provincial Department of Industry and Commerce, who after his corruption was exposed, secretly hid a kitchen knife and plotted to kill and retaliate), and Hu Tingsheng (Manager of the Guisui Business Office of the Provincial Coal Construction Company). Wang Guojie, the person in charge of the Min Dong Canal project, has been dismissed from his post, and the investigation is continuing.
    In addition, the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee, the Provincial People's Government Committee, and the Standing Committee of the Provincial Consultative Committee held a joint meeting on January 10th, deciding to immediately launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in all counties and banners throughout the province. It was also decided to widely mobilize and absorb people from the industrial and commercial sectors to participate in this movement. (Yang Mu)

    绥远省级机关反贪污浪费运动深入展开
    五天中揭发出贪污浪费公款六十多亿元
    绥远省级各单位反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，在省人民政府副主席杨植霖亲自领导下，已有显著成绩。去年十二月三十日，省人民政府副主席杨植霖对省、市两级机关人员进行了继续开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的动员报告后，又在绥远军政委员会、省人民政府委员会、省协商委员会常务委员会联席会议上，沉痛地严肃地作了自我批评。接着各厅、处、局的负责人，大多数都在群众中作了公开的自我批评与检讨。这时，广大干部又看到一月四日人民日报“在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争中，发动群众的关键何在？”的社论，更增加了他们反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的信心与勇气，他们说：“我们现在知道了，不但咱省政府副主席给我们撑腰，毛主席也给我们撑腰，我们一定要打破顾虑，坚决地和贪污、浪费、官僚主义分子作斗争，大胆地揭发和检举。”在群众情绪越来越高涨的情况下，绥远省合作总社在主任宋丕显三次自我检讨后，两天就有二十人自动坦白了自己贪污的事实。省农林厅在两位厅长进行动员后，立即有十六人上台发言，其中一人揭发了民东渠工程负责人王国杰，在兴修民东渠时，贪污、浪费达二亿余万元的罪行。省人民政府办公厅的群众检举了办公厅秘书处副处长邢继业贪污一亿四千余万元的罪行。从一月三日至八日的五天中，仅就省级机关已揭发出的材料初步统计：贪污、浪费的公款已达六十余亿元。
    绥远省的领导方面为了把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动贯彻到底，为了进一步深入地发动群众，已经接受群众要求，把拒不坦白的邢继业（省人民政府秘书处副处长）、吕自斌（省人民政府税务局干部，曾任陕坝专署税务局副局长）、赵世德（省工商厅干部，贪污事实被人揭发后，曾私藏菜刀，图谋杀人报复）、胡廷生（省煤建公司归绥营业处经理）等四个贪污分子逮捕法办。并撤消了民东渠工程负责人王国杰的职务，继续进行追查。
    此外，绥远军政委员会、省人民政府委员会、省协商委员会常务委员会，在一月十日举行了联席会议，决定立即在全省各县、旗同样展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。并决定广泛地发动与吸收工商界人士参加这一运动。　　　（杨木）
