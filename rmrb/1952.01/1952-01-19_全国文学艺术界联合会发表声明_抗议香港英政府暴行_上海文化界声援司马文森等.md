Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles issued a statement expressing a strong protest against the atrocities of the British Hong Kong government in illegally arresting and deporting eight Chinese film artists, including Sima Wensen, Qi Wenshao, and Ma Guoliang, on January 10th.

The statement said: The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles expresses extreme indignation at this atrocity of the British Hong Kong government. We, representing the literary and art workers of the People's Republic of China, lodge a serious protest with the British Hong Kong government. We believe that this atrocity of the British Hong Kong government demonstrates that the British imperialists in Hong Kong are pursuing the aggressive policies of the American imperialists, colluding with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Taiwan, and attempting to use brutal means to undermine and suppress the patriotic activities of our compatriots and the movement for world peace, fully exposing the ugly face of British imperialism.

This atrocity not only directly infringes upon the freedom and rights of our people but also poses a threat to peace-loving people all over the world. The Chinese people will never tolerate such atrocities! We firmly believe that this sinister conspiracy of British imperialism will meet with a shameful defeat in the just struggle of the people of the world and our patriotic compatriots!

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: Shanghai cultural figures angrily protested the barbaric action of the British Hong Kong government in deporting eight Chinese film workers, including Sima Wensen, and expressed warm condolences to Sima Wensen and others, as well as patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. Film artists Xia Yan, Yu Ling, Chen Baichen, Zhong Jingzhi, Ye Yiqun, Bai Yang, Jin Yan, Zuo Lin, Shi Hui, and others all lodged serious protests against the atrocities of the British Hong Kong government. Xia Yan said: "We absolutely cannot tolerate the British Hong Kong government treating our people with such barbaric means. We seriously warn the British Hong Kong government: We in Shanghai's cultural circles will definitely stand with the people of all China to resolutely support the struggle of our Hong Kong compatriots against persecution. We will definitely resolutely oppose to the end this atrocity of the British Hong Kong government's insult and persecution of the Chinese people!"

The Shanghai Drama and Film Workers Association issued a letter of protest on the 16th, pointing out: "This action by the British Hong Kong government once again exposes the conspiracy of the British government and the American and Chiang Kai-shek special agents colluding with each other to further persecute our people in Hong Kong." The letter of protest warned the British Hong Kong government: "You should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this reactionary behavior."

More than 730 staff members of the Changjiang Kunlun Joint Film Studio, Wenhua Film Company, Guotai Film Company, Datong Film Enterprise Company, Daguangming Film Company, Dachina Film Enterprise Company, and Huaguang Film Company also jointly issued a letter of protest on the 16th, saying: "We express our condolences to Mr. Sima Wensen and the other seven gentlemen, and at the same time, we express our deep respect to the progressive film workers and our patriotic people who are still working under the reactionary rule of Hong Kong. We will definitely continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and the movement for increased production and thrift, resolutely implement Mao Zedong's direction in literature and art, to answer the American and British imperialists who dare to provoke us, and smash all the shameless conspiracies of the American and British imperialists!"
