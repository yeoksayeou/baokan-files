We must build the reservoir well!
——贺年信 From Zhao Zhenxiang, a Model Worker in Harnessing the Huai River, to Chairman Mao
Dear Chairman Mao:

Under your leadership, I have been liberated. In the past two years, our lives have become better day by day. I believe that we will never live the life of fleeing famine and begging again. This past year has made me even happier! I became a village cadre; this time, I came to harness the Huai River, and at the county-wide model worker selection meeting, I was selected as an honorable first-class model worker in harnessing the Huai River. What I have gained is not just prizes, but more importantly, various work experiences and methods. Our entire 18th Squad of the 8th Brigade of Yuxian County in harnessing the Huai River has also been rated as a model squad. Chairman Mao! I know that we are still not good enough and need to continue to study hard, improve our skills, and resolutely respond to your call with practical actions:

"We must harness the Huai River well!" I have lived for more than twenty years, and I have never been as happy as I was in this year of 1951. Needless to say, the situation in 1952 will be even better. In order to speed up the country's construction work, I have already gathered my strength! How to welcome 1952? I have made the following plan:

1. Use my brain more, think of more ways, flexibly grasp the organization of labor, fill the earth pushers, compact them firmly, and walk steadily without overturning.

2. Learn three lessons every week, and be able to read, write, and speak. I will also teach the words I learn every day to others; and I will take time to write a diary and read the newspaper.

3. Grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, strengthen the unity between cadres and the masses, and obey the organization's arrangements.

4. Frequently publicize safety precautions, avoid injuring people, strictly prevent soil in the soil ponds from collapsing; strengthen sentry posts, prevent bandits, prevent spies, and prevent fire. Pay attention to hygiene, wash clothes often, and air the bedding often.

5. I will not go home until the reservoir is repaired. And I am ready to respond to all calls from the motherland at any time.

Chairman Mao, I will often check and summarize the above plan, earnestly implement it, and strengthen the spirit of creation. Now that the New Year's Day is coming, the whole country will celebrate you. I would like to pay you the highest respect here and wish you eternal health!

    一定要把水库修好！
    ——治淮劳动模范赵振祥给毛主席的贺年信亲爱的毛主席：
    在你领导下，我翻了身。在这两年内，我们生活一天比一天强。我相信，从今后再不会过那逃荒、要饭的生活啦。过去这一年，更使我高兴啦！我当了乡干部；这一次来治淮，在全县评选模范大会上，我被选为光荣的治淮甲等模范。我所得到的不只是奖品，更主要的是各种的工作经验、方法。俺全体禹县治淮第八大队十八中队也被评上了模范中队。毛主席！我知道我们还通不中用着哩，还得继续加紧学习，提高技能，坚决以实际行动响应你的号召，
    “一定要把淮河修好！”我长了二十多岁了，都没有在这一九五一年里快乐。一九五二年的景况，不用说会要更好了。为了加快国家建设工作，我早攒住劲了！怎样迎接一九五二年？我订了这样的计划：
    1、多用脑筋，多想办法，灵活掌握劳动组织，推土装满，拍实，走稳，不翻车。
    2、每星期要学会三课书，做到会念、会写、会讲。每天自己学会的字，还要转教别人学会；并要抽空写日记，看报。
    3、掌握批评和自我批评的武器，加强干部和群众的团结，服从组织调动。
    4、经常宣传注意安全，不碰伤人，严防土塘里土批砸人；加强岗哨，防土匪，防特务，防火。注意卫生，衣服要常洗，铺草要常晒。
    5、修不好水库不回家。并且随时准备响应祖国的一切号召。
    毛主席，以上的计划我要经常检查总结，认真执行，加强创造精神。现在新年元旦到来，全国都要向你庆贺。我在这里向你致最高敬意，并祝你永远的健康！
