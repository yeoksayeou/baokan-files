Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: Guangzhou people's organizations held a meeting on the 14th to welcome and comfort Li Wenxing, the general representative of the disaster victims in the Tung Tau Tsuen fire zone in Kowloon City, who was unreasonably arrested and deported by the Hong Kong British government. More than 300 representatives from seven people's organizations, including the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Guangdong Provincial Farmers Association, the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Democratic Youth Federation, and the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Democratic Youth Federation, attended the meeting.

After a bizarre fire broke out in Tung Tau Tsuen on November 21 last year, more than 16,000 disaster-stricken compatriots who suffered heavy losses protested against the continuous persecution by the Hong Kong British government and elected representatives to negotiate with the Hong Kong British government. Li Wenxing was elected as the general representative and repeatedly requested the relevant departments of the Hong Kong British government, such as the Social Affairs Bureau and the Health Bureau, to reasonably resolve the aftermath of the disaster area. On the 10th of this month, the Hong Kong government arrested him and deported him.

At the welcoming meeting, Li Wenxing reported indignantly on the Hong Kong British government's barbaric persecution of the disaster-stricken compatriots, saying: "After the major fire in Tung Tau Tsuen, the Hong Kong British government not only did not carry out relief work, but on the contrary, continued to carry out barbarous persecution of our disaster victims. On the third day after the fire, dozens of British policemen wearing steel helmets, together with personnel from the Hong Kong government's Health Bureau, went to the disaster area to forcibly demolish the rebuilt houses, saying that this area was 'unsanitary' and not suitable for buildings; at the same time, more than a dozen large trucks drove up and used barbaric and violent means to grab more than 130 disaster-stricken compatriots onto the trucks and transported them to Ngau Tau Kok, a desolate place with mountains and sea and no people. Disaster victim Zhang Jin refused to demolish his painstakingly rebuilt house. The British police beat him until he was covered in bruises and used iron shovels to hit his head and stuffed mud and sand into his mouth. Finally, he was detained in the police station and extorted HK$30 before being released. At zero o'clock on January 9, the Hong Kong British government once again dispatched thousands of British troops and police, 35 military vehicles, and armored vehicles to surround Tung Tau Tsuen. Twenty or thirty light and heavy machine guns were distributed on each road. After the British military police were deployed, they entered the disaster area, demolished the disaster victim representatives' office built by the disaster victims, and seized all the relief supplies sent by people from all walks of life stored in the house. The next day, the Hong Kong British government unreasonably arrested me and forcibly deported me that afternoon." Li Wenxing finally said: "The crimes of the British imperialists will surely be settled!"

After Li Wenxing's report, everyone present expressed their great indignation at the atrocities of the Hong Kong British government. Lin Qiangyun, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, expressed condolences to Li Wenxing on behalf of the people's organizations and people from all walks of life, and pointed out: "If the Hong Kong British government does not immediately stop its measures to persecute our compatriots, it will surely suffer the consequences!"

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: Guangzhou democratic parties and organizations jointly issued a protest letter on the 15th, protesting against the Hong Kong British government's recent illegal deportation of our compatriots and its connivance with Chiang Kai-shek's remnants to continuously harass the people in our border areas and other barbaric measures and provocative acts. The protest letter was signed by the South China Provisional Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Southern General Branch of the China Democratic League, the Guangdong Provincial Working Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, the South China General Branch of the China Zhi Gong Party, the Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. The full text of the protest letter is as follows: The Hong Kong British government authorities, on January 10, used despicable and shameless means to unreasonably arrest eight patriotic film artists including Sima Wensen, Liu Qiong, Shu Shi, and Ma Guoliang, and deported them without announcing any reason; Li Wenxing, the general representative of the disaster victims in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, Xian Peiling, director of the Kowloon City Branch of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Industry General Union, and Yao Jian, secretary, were also unreasonably deported by the Hong Kong British government one after another. It is reported that the Hong Kong British government's fascist-style terrifying mass arrest atrocities are still being actively planned and carried out.

Recently, the Hong Kong British government has also connived with small groups of bandits such as Xiao Tianlai, remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, to sneak into our territory from the Hong Kong-Kowloon border areas to harass residents, rob property, carry out sabotage explosions, and distribute reactionary leaflets.

It must be pointed out that the above-mentioned series of shameless atrocities by the Hong Kong British government are part of a planned action by British imperialists to follow the aggressive and war-preparedness policies of American imperialists, and their collusion with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan is even more blatant and shameless. On the one hand, the Hong Kong British government is conniving with a group of Chiang Kai-shek's remnants who were swept out of the mainland by the Chinese people to harass the people in our border areas and carry out the most shameless looting; on the other hand, the Hong Kong British government is even more frantically and openly persecuting our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, threatening their rights to survival and safety, and attempting to undermine the great and just patriotic movement of our Hong Kong compatriots.

We hereby lodge the most serious protest against this shameless atrocity by the Hong Kong British government. We solemnly warn the Hong Kong British government: The Chinese people, who have victoriously stood up, are not afraid of all the dying and frantic provocations of imperialism. We will seriously consider effective measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of our compatriots. The Hong Kong British government must be responsible for all the consequences of its shameful atrocities.

    广州各团体集会慰问被逐出境的九龙城东头村灾民代表
    愤怒抗议香港英国政府迫害我国受灾同胞
    广州各民主党派组织警告英当局应对其暴行后果负责
    【新华社广州十六日电】广州各人民团体在十四日举行大会，欢迎和慰问被香港英国政府无理逮捕和驱逐出境的九龙城东头村火灾区灾民总代表李文兴。参加大会的有广东省总工会筹备委员会、广州市总工会筹备委员会、广东省农民协会、广东省民主妇女联合会筹备委员会、广州市民主妇女联合会筹备委员会、广东省民主青年联合会筹备委员会、广州市民主青年联合会筹备委员会等七个人民团体的代表三百多人。
    东头村在去年十一月二十一日发生离奇的大火后，遭受惨重损失的一万六千多受灾同胞，因不断遭香港英国政府的迫害，群起抗议，并选出代表向香港英国政府进行交涉。李文兴被选为总代表，曾多次向香港英国政府社会局、卫生局等有关部门要求合理解决灾区善后问题。本月十日香港政府竟把他逮捕并驱逐出境。
    李文兴在欢迎会上愤慨地报告了香港英国政府对受灾的同胞蛮横迫害的情形说：“香港英国政府在东头村大火灾发生后，不但没有进行善后救济工作，相反，还不断地对我们灾民进行野蛮的迫害。火灾后的第三天，几十个戴着钢盔的英国警察会同香港政府卫生局的人员，到灾区强迫我们拆毁重建起来的房子，说这块地区‘不合卫生’，不适宜有建筑物；同时驶来十多架大卡车，用野蛮强暴的手段，抓了一百三十多个受灾的同胞上车，载往一块背山面海，毫无人烟的荒地牛头角去。灾民张金拒绝拆毁自己艰辛地重建起来的房子，英警竟动手把他打得遍身瘀黑，并用铁锹打他的头，把泥砂塞进他的口里，最后拘进警察署敲榨了港币三十元才放出来。一月九日零时，香港英国政府再次出动了上千的英军和警察、三十五架军车、装甲车，把东头村团团包围起来，二、三十挺轻重机关枪分布在每条通路上。英国军警在部署停当后进入灾区，把灾民自建的灾民代表办事处拆毁，并将屋内贮存的各界人士送来的救济衣物全部抢走。第二天，香港英国政府更无理地逮捕了我，当天下午就将我强暴地驱逐出境。”李文兴最后说：“英帝国主义者的罪行，必将受到清算！”
    李文兴报告后，到会者对香港英国政府的暴行无不表示万分愤慨。广东省总工会筹备委员会主任林锵云在会上代表各人民团体及各界人民对李文兴表示慰问，并指出：“香港英国政府如不立即停止迫害我国同胞的措施，必将自食恶果！”
    【新华社广州十六日电】广州各民主党派组织在十五日联合发出抗议书，抗议香港英国政府最近非法驱逐我国同胞出境和纵容蒋匪残余不断骚扰我边境地区人民等野蛮措施及挑衅行为。在抗议书上署名的有中国国民党革命委员会华南临时工作委员会、中国民主同盟南方总支部、中国农工民主党广东省工作委员会、中国致公党华南总支部、民主建国会广州市分会、中国民主促进会广州市分会筹备委员会等。抗议书全文如下：香港英国政府当局，于一月十日使用卑劣无耻手段，无理拘捕我爱国电影艺术工作者司马文森、刘琼、舒适、马国亮等八人，并不宣布任何理由即行递解出境；先后被香港英国政府无理递解出境的并有九龙城东头村灾民总代表李文兴，港九纺织染业总工会九龙城支会主任冼佩玲、书记姚坚等人。据悉，香港英政府法西斯式的恐怖的大搜捕暴行，仍在积极布置和进行中。
    最近，香港英国政府并纵容蒋匪残兵萧天来等小股匪徒，从港九边境地区，潜入我境骚扰居民，抢劫财物，破坏爆炸，散发反动传单。
    必须指出，香港英国政府上述一系列无耻暴行，是英帝国主义者追随美帝国主义者的侵略与备战政策的有计划行动的一部分，而与台湾蒋介石残余匪帮相互勾结，更属露骨和无耻。香港英国政府一方面纵容被中国人民从大陆上扫荡出去的一批蒋匪残余，来骚扰我边境地区人民，进行最无耻的抢掠行劫；另一方面，香港英国政府又更疯狂、更公开地迫害我香港爱国同胞，威胁他们的生存权利及生命安全，企图破坏我香港同胞的伟大的正义的爱国运动。
    我们对香港英国政府此种无耻暴行，特提出最严重的抗议。我们严正地警告香港英国政府：胜利地站起来了的中国人民，是不怕一切帝国主义垂死的疯狂的挑衅的，我们将认真考虑保护我们同胞正当权益的有效措施，香港英国政府必须对它的可耻暴行的一切后果负责。
