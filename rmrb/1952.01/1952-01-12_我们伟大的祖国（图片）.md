Those participating in the study include Wang Jingbin, a female telephone operator from Andong City who heroically persisted in her work under frequent enemy bombing, Liu Jingui, an advanced producer who repeatedly set new records, Wang Zhaoda, a labor model from Lushun-Dalian City, and Tian Guiying, China's first female train driver. They are all concentrating on their studies.
