Telegram of Condolences from the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union to the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party:

Upon hearing the news of the passing of Marshal Choibalsan, leader of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Mongolian People's Hero, comrade-in-arms and friend of Sukhe-Bator – the founder of the Mongolian People's State – the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union shares your profound grief.

The death of Comrade Choibalsan deprives the working people of the Mongolian People's Republic of a great fighter for the freedom and independence of the Mongolian people, the organizer of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, under whose leadership the Mongolian people overthrew the rule of feudal lords and foreign colonialists and embarked on the path of building a people's democratic state.

The Soviet people will forever remember Comrade Choibalsan, the outstanding leader of the Mongolian people, and believe that the Mongolian people will continue to advance on the path pointed out by Sukhe-Bator and Choibalsan.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union

    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会唁电蒙古人民革命党中央委员会：
    惊闻蒙古人民革命党领袖，蒙古人民英雄苏赫—巴托尔——蒙古人民国家的缔造者——的战友和友人乔巴山元帅逝世，苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会和你们一样地深感悲痛。
    乔巴山同志逝世，使蒙古人民共和国的劳动人民失掉争取蒙古人民的自由与独立的伟大战士、蒙古人民革命党的组织者，蒙古人民在他的领导之下推翻了封建主和外国殖民者的政权，并且走上了建设人民民主国家的道路。
    苏联人民将永远铭记着蒙古人民的杰出领袖乔巴山同志，并且相信蒙古人民将继续在苏赫—巴托尔和乔巴山所指引的道路上前进。
    苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会
