Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 3rd: The Finance and Economics Committee of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee announced on New Year's Day a plan to increase production and practice economy by 35 trillion yuan for state-owned and joint state-private enterprises in the entire region in 1952. This plan requires all state-owned factories, mines, transportation, postal and telecommunications, trade departments, and all public and joint state-private enterprises in the region to achieve the goals of increasing production and practicing economy this year by improving equipment utilization rates, reducing costs, improving quality, accelerating capital turnover, improving basic construction, and opposing corruption and waste. In terms of improving equipment utilization, the power industry in the Chongqing area alone can relatively increase power by 4,000 kilowatts after adjusting the load, which can save 300 billion yuan in basic construction costs. In terms of reducing costs, this plan requires the entire region's heavy industry to reduce production costs by 6% to 8%, and light industry to reduce costs by 8% to 10%. In terms of accelerating capital turnover, this plan requires the capital turnover time of heavy industry in the entire region to be shortened by at least one-sixth, and light industry by one-fifth. The plan stipulates that all units of the state-owned trade enterprise system in the Southwest region should increase production and practice economy by 10 trillion yuan this year by reducing commodity circulation costs.
