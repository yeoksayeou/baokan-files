Everyone Come Participate in the Inspection of Preferential Treatment Work Before and After the Spring Festival

I. The Flesh-and-Blood Relationship Between the People's Army and Us

Everyone happily celebrated the New Year, and a joyous Spring Festival is just around the corner. The happy lives we lead today are inseparable from our People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. As everyone knows, our People's Army has sacrificed blood and fought arduously for more than twenty years, from the Nanchang Uprising in Jiangxi to the liberation of the mainland. Even today, our People's Liberation Army and People's Armed Police are painstakingly guarding the country's defenses, preventing imperialists from invading us; they are still traversing mountains and ridges to wipe out the remaining bandits, allowing everyone to live in peace. In the past year or so, the People's Liberation Army has overcome numerous difficulties and marched into remote Tibet. They ate in the wind and slept in the dew, climbing over many mountains five or six thousand meters high, covered with snow all year round and rarely visited by people. But the soldiers never complained, they only had one sentence: "Complete the task assigned to us by the people of the motherland." The soldiers in the rear areas helped the villagers with their work and participated in the cause of production and construction as soon as they settled down. They worked for the people of the whole country without stopping for a moment.

On the Korean battlefield, our volunteers disregarded sacrifice and climbed onto enemy tanks to eliminate the enemy; some waded through freezing currents filled with ice floes to pursue the enemy; many soldiers continued fighting even after being wounded. One soldier ate snow and fried flour on the Korean front, saying: "I am eating snow here so that the people of our motherland do not have to eat snow." A volunteer comrade's left eye was injured, and both hands were crippled. He said: "My eyes are injured, and my hands are crippled, but we have protected the eyes and hands of thousands upon thousands of people in our motherland. I think this is the greatest glory of my life." They are truly the best sons and daughters of the people of the whole country, and they treat the people of the whole country as their relatives. Can we, in the rear, forget them when we are living comfortable lives? Can we forget their parents, brothers, wives, and children?

II. Conduct a General Inspection of Preferential Treatment Work Before and After the Spring Festival

Yes, the people of the whole country have never forgotten their army.

Generally speaking, all parts of the country attach importance to supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. The people of the whole country say: Soldiers are the most beloved people. When everyone formulated patriotic pacts last year, many places regarded doing a good job in preferential treatment work as an important part of the patriotic pact. Around the Spring Festival and the "August 1st" Army Day in 1951, all parts of the country launched movements to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs and conducted a general inspection of preferential treatment work. The preferential treatment work in many places has been greatly strengthened. For example, many land tilling groups in Shanxi Province have done "revolutionary soldiers and martyrs first, then ourselves" when working, cultivating carefully, applying more fertilizer, so that the land tilled on behalf of others has reaped a bumper harvest, and some yields have exceeded the level of ordinary people. In Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province, when planting cotton, they encountered a drought, and the masses carried water to plant more than 20,000 mu of cotton for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. The people of Xin'an County, Northern Jiangsu, automatically built more than 9,500 houses for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. These examples are worthy of everyone's learning.

However, there are still shortcomings in the preferential treatment work in some places. Even in places where the preferential treatment work is done well, it is necessary to continue to improve. Therefore, it is very necessary to conduct another general inspection of the preferential treatment work.

In October 1951, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen of the Chinese People's Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea General Association, in his "Report on the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country" at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, called on the people of the whole country to continue to strengthen preferential treatment work and proposed that all parts of the country conduct a general inspection of preferential treatment work before and after the Spring Festival, and formulate a concrete plan for preferential treatment work in 1952, with the grassroots regime as the unit. Based on this proposal, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government issued "Instructions on Inspecting and Carrying Out Preferential Treatment Work Before and After the Spring Festival" to the whole country on December 11 last year. Many local governments have also issued instructions successively and are mobilizing and deploying this work.

It is hoped that the people of the whole country will enthusiastically participate in this general inspection of preferential treatment work. What should be inspected? The following points should be mainly noted: First, everyone should first check their own thinking, check their understanding of preferential treatment work? Do you understand the flesh-and-blood relationship between the people's army and ourselves? Do you regard preferential treatment work as a glorious obligation that everyone should fulfill? Are you respectful and concerned about the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers? Second, check whether the preferential treatment regulations have been implemented. For example, is there any misappropriation of preferential treatment funds by local governments? How is the land tilling work done in rural areas? Has the land yield of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers reached the level of ordinary people? Is the work of helping the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in cities to engage in production and employment done well? How is the problem of school dropout of children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers solved? What difficulties do the poor families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers still have in their lives? Is the work of commemorating and commending revolutionary martyrs done enough? Have disabled revolutionary soldiers and demobilized revolutionary soldiers been properly resettled? Are there any biases such as "people are treated well when the person is present and the relationship exists", "preferential treatment is given to those nearby rather than those far away", "preferential treatment is given to the new rather than the old"? Everyone (including the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers themselves) should put forward their opinions on these issues. Third, in the inspection process, pay attention to summing up experience, paying attention to commendation and criticism. For example, some places implement fixed land tilling (contracting production, contracting tilling, combining with mutual aid teams, etc.), solve the problem of land fertilizer for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, solve the problem of unbalanced labor burden, introduce families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers to employment and organize production, etc. If good results have been achieved, the experience should be summarized and introduced to everyone for reference. Some land tilling groups or individuals have done a very good job in preferential treatment work, everyone should commend him and learn from them. Those who have not done well in preferential treatment work should be criticized and urged to correct them. If shortcomings and problems are found in the inspection, everyone should find ways to solve them.

III. Formulate a One-Year Preferential Treatment Work Plan and Launch a Comfort Movement

Preferential treatment work is a regular work, so it should be carried out in a planned way. This time, after inspecting the preferential treatment work, all localities should formulate a 1952 preferential treatment work plan for grassroots units. For example, in rural areas, each township or village should first formulate a plan for the entire township or village, and then, according to this plan, formulate a concrete plan for each land tilling group or each person, and incorporate the main content of the plan into the patriotic pact to ensure its realization. When formulating the plan, it is necessary to base it on the specific local conditions, absorb advanced experience, and stipulate appropriate systems, such as land tilling groups and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers signing collective land tilling contracts, stipulating work point calculation methods, reward and punishment methods, etc. After the plan is formulated, everyone should allocate labor and animal power as soon as possible, and help the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers prepare sufficient fertilizer and select good seeds as soon as possible, so that the land tilled on behalf of others will achieve a bumper harvest this year. The same is true in cities. Each city, each district, and even each street and each organization unit should formulate a one-year plan to solve the problem of production and employment for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in a step-by-step manner and provide appropriate care for the lives of poor families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. In short, whether in rural or urban areas, we must take a long-term view and provide regular and reliable guarantees for the production and life of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. In the past, the biggest shortcoming in the preferential treatment work in some places was the lack of a long-term plan and the work was not regular. This often resulted in the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers not receiving the care they deserved; sometimes everyone grabbed at random, wasting manpower and material resources. Places with this shortcoming should pay attention to correcting it in this inspection.

In conjunction with this general inspection of preferential treatment work and the formulation of the 1952 plan, we should also launch a movement to comfort the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and the sick and wounded around the Spring Festival. On December 22 last year, the General Association of Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Central Ministry of Education, and the Broadcasting Administration jointly wrote a letter to children across the country, calling on every child to work hard to do one thing during the Spring Festival to comfort the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. Children across the country should warmly respond to this call. Schools in all localities should organize this movement well. In addition to children, other members of the masses and personnel of organizations and groups should also participate in the comfort movement as much as possible. In the comfort movement, everyone should pay attention to frugality and not be extravagant and wasteful.

Finally, honorable families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, while receiving the respect and care of the people of the whole country, everyone should work harder, strive for greater glory, and strive to be model families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and model disabled revolutionary soldiers. The families of soldiers should also write letters to their children, husbands, and brothers in the army, reporting on the situation of being respected and given preferential treatment, and encourage the comrades of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to vigilantly guard our national defense and work harder to kill the enemy and strive for greater honor.

### 大家来参加春节前后优抚工作的检查

专栏：宣传员讲话

    大家来参加春节前后优抚工作的检查
    一、人民军队和我们的血肉关系大家高高兴兴过了新年，一个快乐的春节眼看又到来了。我们今天过着幸福的日子，是和我们的人民解放军、人民志愿军分不开的。大家都知道，我们的人民军队从江西南昌起义到全国大陆解放，牺牲流血、艰苦斗争了二十多年，直到今天，我们的人民解放军和人民公安部队还在千辛万苦地守卫着祖国的国防，不让帝国主义来侵犯我们；还在翻山越岭地清剿残余的土匪，让我们大家过着安静的日子。最近一年多来，人民解放军克服了重重困难，进军到遥远的西藏。他们风餐露宿，爬过了许多五、六千公尺高、终年积雪、人迹不到的山岭。可是战士们从来不叫苦，他们只有一句话：“完成祖国人民交给我们的任务。”在后方的战士们，住下来就帮老乡做活，参加生产建设事业，他们一刻也不停地为全国人民工作。
    我们的志愿军在朝鲜战场上，有的不顾牺牲爬上敌人的坦克去消灭敌人；有的涉过浮着冰块的寒流追击敌人；许多战士受了伤也不下火线。一位战士在朝鲜前线一边吃雪一边吃炒面，他说：“我在这里吃雪，正是为了我们祖国的人民不吃雪。”一位志愿军同志的左眼受了伤，双手也残废了。他说：“我的眼睛受了伤，我的手残废了，可是我们保卫了祖国人民千千万万双眼睛，千千万万双手。我觉得这是我一生中最大的光荣。”他们真是全国人民最好的子弟，他们把全国人民当他们的亲人看待。我们在后方的人，当我们过着舒舒服服的日子的时候，能忘记他们吗？能忘记他们的父母兄弟妻子儿女们吗？
    二、春节前后要普遍检查一次优抚工作
    是的，全国人民从来也没有忘记过自己的军队。
    一般地说，全国各地都是重视拥军优属工作的。全国人民都说：战士们是我们最可爱的人。去年大家订立爱国公约的时候，许多地方都把做好优抚工作当作爱国公约里的一项重要内容。一九五一年春节和“八一”建军节前后，全国各地都开展了拥军优属运动，并且普遍检查了一次优抚工作。许多地方的优抚工作大大加强了。例如山西省许多代耕组在做活的时候，都做到了“先军属后自己”，精耕细作、加工加肥，使代耕土地得到了丰收，有的收成超过了一般群众的水平。河北省唐山专区种棉时碰上了天旱，群众给烈属、军属挑水种棉两万多亩。苏北新安县的人民，自动给烈属、军属修建了房屋九千五百多间。这些榜样，都是值得大家学习的。
    但是，有一些地方的优抚工作，还是有缺点的，就是优抚工作做得好的地方，也须要继续提高，所以对优抚工作要再进行一次普遍的检查，这是非常必要的。
    一九五一年十月，中国人民抗美援朝总会彭真副主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上所作“关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告”里，曾经号召全国人民继续加强优抚工作，并提议在春节前后全国各地对优抚工作进行一次普遍的检查，并以基层政权为单位，订出一九五二年优抚工作的具体计划。中央人民政府内务部根据这个提议，在去年十二月十一日向全国发出了“关于春节前后检查与进行优抚工作的指示”。许多地方政府也先后发了指示，并正在动员布置这个工作。
    这次优抚工作的普遍检查，希望全国人民都来热烈参加。检查些什么呢？主要地应该注意这几点：第一，大家首先从自己的思想上检查，检查自己对优抚工作的认识是怎样的？是不是明白了人民军队和我们自己的血肉关系？是不是把优抚工作当成了一项人人应尽的光荣义务？对烈属、军属和革命残废军人是不是尊敬和关心？第二，检查优抚条例是不是贯彻执行了。比如，地方政府的优抚经费是不是有挪用现象？农村里的代耕工作做得怎样？烈属、军属的土地产量是不是达到了一般群众的水平？城市里帮助烈属、军属生产就业的工作做得好不好？烈士子女和军属子女失学问题解决得怎样？贫苦的烈属、军属的生活还有些什么困难？对革命烈士的纪念表扬工作做得够不够？对革命残废军人和复员革命军人安置妥当了没有？有没有“人在人情在”、“优近不优远”、“优新不优旧”等偏向？对这些问题，大家（包括烈属军属自己）都应该提出意见。第三，在检查中间，要注意总结经验，注意表扬和批评。比如有些地方实行固定代耕（包产、包耕、与互助组结合等），解决烈属、军属种地肥料问题，解决劳力负担不平衡问题，介绍烈属、军属和革命残废军人就业与组织生产等，有了好的成绩，应该把经验总结出来，介绍给大家参考。有的代耕组或个人，做优抚工作做得很好，大家应该对他加以表扬，并向他们学习。有的人对优抚工作做得不好，应该提出批评，督促他改正。检查中发现了工作中的缺点和问题，大家都要想办法来加以解决。
    三、订出一年优抚工作计划，开展慰劳运动
    优抚工作是经常性的工作，所以要有计划地进行。这次，各地在检查了优抚工作之后，都应该订出基层单位的一九五二年优抚工作计划。比如，在农村里，每个乡或村应先订出全乡或全村的计划，然后根据这个计划，订出每个代耕小组或每个人的具体计划，并且把计划的主要内容订到爱国公约里去，保证实现。订计划的时候，要根据当地具体情况，吸取先进经验，规定适当的制度，比如代耕组和烈属、军属订立集体的代耕合同，规定记工办法、奖惩办法等。订了计划之后，大家就要及早调配劳力畜力，及早帮助烈属军属准备充分的肥料、选择好的种籽，使代耕土地今年达到丰收。城市里面也是这样，每个市、每个区直到每条街道和每个组织单位，都要订出一年的计划，以便有步骤地解决烈属、军属生产就业的问题，并使贫苦烈属、军属的生活有适当的照顾。总之，无论在农村或城市，都要从长期着眼，使烈属、军属的生产、生活有经常的可靠的保证。过去，有一些地方的优抚工作中最大的缺点就是没有长期计划，工作不经常。这样往往有时使烈属、军属得不到应有的照顾；有时又大家乱抓，浪费人力物力。有这种缺点的地方，在这次检查中，应该注意改过来。
    结合这次普遍检查优抚工作和订立一九五二年的计划，在春节前后我们还要开展一个慰劳烈属、军属、革命残废军人和伤病员的运动。去年十二月二十二日，抗美援朝总会、青年团中央委员会、中央教育部和广播事业局，曾联合给全国的少年儿童写信，号召每一位少年儿童在春节期间，努力做好一件事，慰劳烈属军属。全国的少年儿童们应该热烈响应这个号召。各地的学校应该好好地组织这个运动。除了少年儿童之外，其他群众和机关团体人员，也应该尽可能地参加慰劳运动。在慰劳运动中，大家要注意节约，不要铺张浪费。
    最后，全国光荣的烈属、军属和革命残废军人同志们，在受到全国人民的尊敬和关心的时候，大家要更加努力，争取更大的光荣，争取做模范的烈属、军属和模范的革命残废军人。军属们还应该向自己在部队里的子女、丈夫和兄弟写信，报告自己受尊敬受优待的情况，并鼓励人民解放军和人民志愿军的同志们警惕地守卫我们的国防和更加努力杀敌，争取更大的荣誉。
