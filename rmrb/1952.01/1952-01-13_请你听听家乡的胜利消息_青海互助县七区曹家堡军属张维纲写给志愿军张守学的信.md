Listen to the News of Victory from Our Hometown
    ——A Letter from Zhang Weigang, a Military Family Member from Caojiabao, Seventh District, Huzhu County, Qinghai, to Zhang Shouхue, a Volunteer Soldier

Shouxue, my son:

    In my previous letter, I told you, "We are about to start land reform here." In this letter, I want to tell you, "Our land reform here has been successfully completed!"

    I've lived for fifty or sixty years, and I've never experienced anything so delightful. The unity of our people of all ethnic groups is truly powerful! The landlord class that has been riding on our heads for thousands of years has been overthrown by us. We peasants have truly become the masters. Everyone has land, everyone has housing, laying the foundation for a good life in the future.

    Since you joined the Volunteer Army, everything at home has been treated favorably by the People's Government, the Farmers' Association, and our neighbors. Gifts are given during the New Year and festivals; plowing and harvesting are helped; when agricultural loans are issued, the Farmers' Association always puts our family at the front. During the land reform, everyone in the village said, "Military families should be treated well! If it weren't for our Volunteer Army fighting the American devils at the front, how could we have such good days." Since you left, there is one less laborer in the family, so everyone distributed the nearby land to our family. The best irrigated land is only one hundred and fifty steps away from the gate, and I can carry manure there thirty times a day. I always go there to walk around several times a day, thinking in my heart, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's good leadership, even if I spent all day and all night in the fields, I wouldn't be able to earn this land in several lifetimes." Oh, I almost forgot to tell you: our family not only got six mu, eight fen, and one li of irrigated land, but also nine mu, four fen, and five li of shallow mountain dry land.

    As for livestock, our family has a cow and a donkey, so we were not originally eligible to receive livestock; but because you are fighting the American invaders in Korea, everyone thought that our cow was old and we should have a strong animal, so they distributed the best foal to us. A yellow foal, purebred, will be able to carry manure by this time next year. Shouxue, you tell me, when has my family ever raised a horse! I was so happy that day, I patted the foal, brushed its hair, cleaned it thoroughly, and led it to drink some water.

    Farming tools, grain, and furniture were also distributed: a brand-new bookshelf, kang cabinet, water tank, sacks, measuring cups, two big dou of wheat, one big dou of coarse grains, and we also shared a large cart with others. On the day the goods were distributed, everyone carried them to our home and said, "Write another letter to Shouxue and send our regards to him on behalf of everyone. Tell him to eliminate more American devils."

    Your wife is also very respected. On the day the goods were distributed, the director of the Farmers' Association said, "Let's give this red satin curtain to Yuan Chunfang, the wife of our Volunteer soldier!" "Agreed!" "Agreed!" Everyone applauded. Chunfang has been very active in the land reform and has been elected as the leader of the Farmers' Association group, and has also joined the Youth League. After the land reform in our township was completed, she went to Shuangshu Township with the work team to do land reform work. Before leaving, the whole family held a farewell party for her, instructing her to work hard and learn from you.

    Shouxue, you know about the hard days in the village in the past. Think back: our family had five mu and several fen of land, and we rented more than two mu from the landlord. We were busy all year round, and after paying rent, grain, and miscellaneous taxes, our family of eight could only survive for four months, even with potatoes. Then we relied on your brother running around singing shadow plays and doing side jobs to earn some money, and we lived on potato soup. After liberation, rent was reduced and production was developed, and we could eat grain for eight months. After the land reform, as long as we put in a little more effort, days of plenty will begin. Recently, your brother Shouхun earned some wheat from sideline occupations, which can be sold for 80,000 yuan. In the movement to increase production and donate to resist America and aid Korea, we donated 60,000 yuan. Shouxue, you fight the American devils at the front, and we work hard to produce in the rear.

    With such good days at home, and with the People's Government and the Farmers' Association taking care of us from time to time, you don't have to worry about family matters. Work harder to learn your skills, kill more American devils, protect the safety of the motherland, and protect our happy days after liberation.

    Father, Weigang

    请你听听家乡的胜利消息
    ——青海互助县七区曹家堡军属张维纲写给志愿军张守学的信守学我儿：
    前一封信我曾经告诉你：“我们这里就要土地改革”；在这封信里，我要对你说：“我们这里土地改革已经胜利完成啦！”
    我活了五六十岁，没经过这么痛快的事。我们各族农民团结起来力量真大呀！几千年来骑在我们头上的地主阶级都被我们打倒了。我们农民真正当了主人。谁也有了地，谁也有了房屋，给以后过好日子打下底子了。
    你入志愿军以后，家里一切事情都受到人民政府、农会和乡邻的优待。过年过节送礼；犁地割田帮工；发放农贷款时，农会总要把咱家排在前头。土地改革中，村上谁都说：“军属要优待好啊！不是咱们志愿军在前方打美国鬼子，咱们那有这样的好日子。”你走了，家里少个劳动力，大伙就把就近的地分给咱家。头等水地，出大门只不过一百五十步远，驮粪一天能驮三十个来回。我每天总要去那里转几个圈子。心里思摸着：“不是毛主席的好领导，就是整天整夜长在地里，几辈子也挣不下这些地。”噢，写半会忘记告诉你了：咱家不光分这六亩八分一厘水地，还分了九亩四分五厘浅山旱地。
    论牲口，咱家有一头牛、一头驴，所以分牲口，本来轮不到头上；可是因为你在朝鲜打美国侵略军，大伙想到咱的牛老了，应该有个得劲牲口，就把最好的一匹马驹分给咱了。黄马驹子，原口儿，明年这时候就能驮粪了。守学，你说，我家人老几辈子，啥时候喂过马呀！那天我高兴坏了，拍拍马驹子，扫扫毛，浑身扫得净净的，牵去饮它几口水。
    农具、粮食、家具，也都分到了：一个新新的书架炕柜，还有水缸、口袋、升子，二大斗麦子，一大斗杂粮，还给别人合伙分了辆大车。分东西那天，大伙还给咱抬送到家里，说：“再写信给守学，代我们大家给他问个好。转告他多消灭几个美国鬼子。”
    你的女人也很受尊敬。分东西的那天，农会主任说：“把这个红缎帐子分给咱们志愿军的爱人袁春芳吧！”“赞成！”“赞成！”大伙一阵鼓掌。春芳在土地改革中很积极，被选为农会小组长了，还入了青年团。咱乡土地改革结束后，她随工作组到双树乡做土地改革工作去了。临走，全家开了个欢送会送她，嘱咐她好好工作，向你学习。
    守学，村上从前苦难的日子你知道。你回想回想：咱家自己五亩几分地，租种地主二亩多，一年忙到头，除了交租交粮支杂差，一家八口人，连洋芋算上只能维持四个月的生活。再就全靠你哥东奔西跑唱影子戏、搞副业，挣些钱来，洋芋拌汤打发日子。解放后，减了租、发展了生产，光靠粮食就能吃到八个月。土地改革以后呀，只要再加一把劲，丰衣足食的日子开始了。最近你守训哥搞副业赚了些麦子，可卖八万元。我们在抗美援朝增产捐献运动中，捐了六万元。守学，你们在前方打美国鬼子，我们在后方努力生产。
    家里日子这样好，又有人民政府、农会时常照顾，你尽管不要操心家事。更加努力学好本领，多杀美国鬼子，保卫祖国安全，保卫咱们翻身后的幸福日子。
    父维纲
