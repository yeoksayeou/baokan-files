Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 2nd. The People's Liberation Army troops in Tibet sent a telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteers on New Year's Day to congratulate them on the New Year. The telegram is as follows: Commander Peng and all commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    On the occasion of the New Year's Day of 1952, we extend our most respectful New Year greetings to you from the Kangzang Plateau of our motherland.

    You have responded to the great call of the motherland and are standing on the front line of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. Through more than a year of heroic and arduous battles, you have dealt a heavy blow to the US imperialist aggressors and their accomplices, and made great and brilliant contributions to the motherland and world peace. Your high spirit of patriotism and internationalism has greatly encouraged the confidence of the people of the motherland and the world in striving for peace, and has also strengthened our will to advance and fight on the Kangzang Plateau. Whether in the long march through mountains and rivers, snowy mountains and grasslands, or in the production and construction work of cutting through thorns and chiseling rocks, as long as we think of your selfless heroic struggle and hear your good news, we will increase our strength to fight against difficulties.

    On this New Year, we guarantee to implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, eliminate imperialist influence in Tibet, and complete the task of building Tibet and consolidating national defense, in order to cooperate with your great actions to combat the US-British imperialist aggressors.

    We wish you a happy New Year!
            All commanders and
                combatants of the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops in Tibet
                        New Year's Day, 1952
