    Li Shusheng: An Example of Integrity and Public Service
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Peng Xue
    When Li Shusheng, a purchasing agent for the state-owned People's Construction Company, first arrived at the company, the manager earnestly instructed him: There are many tricks used by unscrupulous merchants. You must be vigilant at all times and not be fooled by them. From then on, whenever Li Shusheng came into contact with merchants, he was always very careful.
    Once, Li Shusheng went to the Wenru Timber Company on West First Road in Xi'an to buy one hundred and sixty bundles of tile battens, agreeing on a price of 36,500 yuan per bundle. However, the invoice stated 38,500 yuan. After Li Shusheng looked at the invoice, he was baffled and asked the boss what was going on. The boss quickly took the invoice, smiled ingratiatingly, and said, "That's right, that's the price; we can't ask for more money." He then pretended to blame the accountant, saying:
    "Why did you write the invoice wrong? Issue another one for Comrade Li." Li Shusheng remembered what the manager had said and thought: This boss wants to lure me in; I must be even more careful.
    Not long after, Li Shusheng went to the Wenru Timber Company again to buy wood planks. The boss insisted on taking him to a restaurant first, but he firmly refused and immediately went with the boss to the lumberyard to inspect the wood. On the way, the boss deliberately talked to him about the corrupt lifestyles of some people in the city, saying that government cadres were too poor. The boss wanted him to be smarter. At that moment, a woman walked by, and the boss gently tugged at Li Shusheng's sleeve, whispering, "This is a prostitute. We always had them at our banquets before. Do you want to go to a restaurant and have some fun?" Li Shusheng turned around and glared at him fiercely, and the boss quickly changed the subject. Then, the boss talked to him about making friends, asked about his family's financial situation, and pretended to be sincere, saying, "You are an old customer. If you have any difficulties, we can help." Li Shusheng did not answer him. Upon arriving at the lumberyard, Li Shusheng inspected the wood and bought 119 zhang of "Hunan Pine" planks.
    The next evening, Li Shusheng was not at home when someone delivered one million yuan to his house, claiming to be a friend of Li Shusheng and willing to help him solve his family's difficulties. Li Shusheng's wife dared not accept the money. Just then, Li Shusheng returned home. He immediately recognized that this person was the boss of the Wenru Timber Company. He immediately had an idea and accepted the money. The boss was very happy and left, swaggering. The next morning, Li Shusheng handed over the bribe from the unscrupulous merchant to the company leaders without spending any of it.
    Two days later, the Xi'an Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce summoned the boss of the Wenru Timber Company. It was found that the Wenru Timber Company frequently issued false invoices, bribed cadres, and sold substandard timber as high-quality timber. The batch of timber Li Shusheng bought was all "Hunan Pine," but the boss of the company intended to replace half of it with "Baoji Pine" when delivering the goods. At that time, "Baoji Pine" planks were 100,000 yuan cheaper per zhang than "Hunan Pine" planks. If Li Shusheng had accepted the bribe, the state would have suffered a loss of 5.85 million yuan.
    From then on, Li Shusheng became even more vigilant. Once, he went to another store to buy wood, and the boss of that store also gave him a false invoice. He severely reprimanded that merchant. Another time, he went to buy mats, and because he bought a lot, the merchant wanted to give him a personal cool mat, but he refused.
    Li Shusheng is responsible for the construction company's purchasing work, and he has many opportunities to contact merchants. Although many merchants want to lure him with benefits, he has never wavered. He also often tries to do a good job in purchasing. Last year, the timber he was responsible for buying was 143 million yuan cheaper than the market price. Therefore, last November, Li Shusheng was selected as a special-class labor model within the company and was commended by the Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce.
    Li Shusheng is from Zizhou County, Shaanxi Province, and comes from a peasant background. He joined the revolution in 1946. After the victory of the Liberation War, he moved from the countryside to the city, and his thinking also underwent some fluctuations. He saw that other people were dressed lavishly, while he was wearing plain cloth clothes, and he felt a little uncomfortable. However, because he often discussed his ideological problems with leading comrades and other comrades, actively sought education and help from the leadership and other comrades, and frequently engaged in self-criticism, this kind of thinking did not develop further. When he took on the purchasing work at the state-owned People's Construction Company, the leadership constantly conducted ideological education for him. Therefore, he finally adhered to the position of serving the people and resisted the erosion of bourgeois ideology.

    廉洁奉公的李树生
    新华社记者　彭雪
    公营人民建筑公司采购员李树生刚到公司来的时候，经理认真地嘱咐他说：奸商的鬼花样很多，要时时刻刻留心，不要上了奸商的当。从此，李树生每逢与商人接触时，总是非常小心。
    有一次李树生到西安市西一路温如木行买了一百六十捆挂瓦条，讲好每捆价钱三万六千五百元，但是，发票上却写的是三万八千五百元。李树生看了发票后，莫名其妙，就问老板是什么道理。老板赶紧把发票接过去陪着笑脸说：“不错，是这个价钱，不能多要钱。”并装腔作势地埋怨管账的说：
    “为什么把发票开错了？另给李同志开一张。”李树生记起经理的话，想道：这位老板想叫我上钩，我要更加当心。
    不久，李树生又到温如木行去买木板，老板硬拉他先去吃馆子，他坚决拒绝了，立即和老板一块儿到木料场去看木料。路上，老板又故意对他谈城市中某些人的腐化生活，说人民政府的干部太清苦了。老板要他学聪明些。这时正好路旁走过一个女人，老板就轻轻拉了一下李树生的衣袖，轻声说：“这就是妓女，我们以前请客都少不了她们，你要不要到饭馆里去玩一玩？”李树生回过头来狠狠地瞪了他一眼，老板才赶紧用别的话岔开了。接着，老板和他谈起交朋友的事，问他的家庭经济情况，装出一付诚恳的样子说：“你是老顾主了，如果有困难，咱们可以帮忙。”李树生没有回答他。到了木料厂，李树生查看了木料，买定了一百一十九丈“湖南松”木板。
    第二天晚上，李树生不在家，有一个人送一百万元到他家里来，自称是李树生的朋友，愿意帮助李树生解决家庭困难。李树生的老婆不敢收下这笔钱，这时恰好李树生回来了，他一看这个人就是温如木行的老板。他马上心生一计，把钱收下。老板心里很高兴，就摇头幌脑地走了。次日一清早，李树生就把奸商向他行贿的这笔钱原封不动地交给公司领导人。
    过了两天，西安市人民政府工商局把温如木行的老板传去，查明温如木行经常开假发票，贿赂干部，以次木料当好木料出售。李树生买的那批木料全是“湖南松”，但该行老板却打算在交货时用一半“宝鸡松”顶替，当时“宝鸡松”木板比“湖南松”木板每丈要便宜十万元。假使李树生受了贿，就会使国家遭到五百八十五万元的损失。
    从此，李树生更加警惕起来。有一次他到另一家商店去买木料，那家商店的老板也给他开假发票，他就把那个商人狠狠地斥责了一顿。又有一次他去买席子，因为买得很多，商人要送给他私人一张凉席，也被他拒绝了。
    李树生负责建筑公司的采买工作，接触商人的机会很多，虽然很多商人都想利诱他，但他始终没有动摇。他并且经常想法做好采购工作，去年经他负责买回的木料，较市价共要便宜一亿四千三百多万元。因此，去年十一月，李树生在公司内被选为特等劳动模范，并受到西安市工商局的通报表扬。
    李树生是陕西省子洲县人，农民出身。一九四六年参加革命。解放战争胜利后，他从农村到了城市，思想上也曾起了一些波动。他看见人家穿的阔气，自己一身土布衣服，有些不大舒服。但是因为他经常能把自己的思想问题向领导同志和其他同志谈，主动地取得领导方面和其他同志的教育和帮助，他自己也经常进行自我批评，因此这种思想没有发展下去。他在公营人民建筑公司担任采购工作时，领导方面又不断地对他进行思想教育，因此，他终于坚持了为人民服务的立场，抗拒了资产阶级思想意识的侵蚀。
