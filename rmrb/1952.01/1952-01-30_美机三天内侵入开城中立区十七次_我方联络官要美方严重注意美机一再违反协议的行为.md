Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 29th. On the 28th, our liaison officer, Senior Colonel Chai Chengwen, met with the opposing liaison officer, Murray, demanding that the other side pay serious attention to the repeated violations of the agreement by American aircraft intruding into the Kaesong Neutral Zone and the conference area. Senior Colonel Chai solemnly pointed out: Since the two instances of American aircraft violating the agreement on January 17th and 18th, the violations by American aircraft have not ceased. In just three days, from January 25th to 27th, there have been as many as seventeen incidents of American aircraft violating the Kaesong Neutral Zone. In one instance – at 10:10 AM on January 25th, an enemy military aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Panmunjom conference area – which has already been confirmed through a joint investigation by both sides' security officers. Senior Colonel Chai also provided the opposing side with detailed information (including time, location, number and type of aircraft, flight direction, etc.) regarding the American aircraft's violations of the agreement by intruding into the Kaesong area during the three days from January 25th to 27th. The instances of American aircraft intruding into the Kaesong Neutral Zone within three days are as follows: On January 25th, American aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone a total of eight times. At 10:25 AM, twelve American jet aircraft flew from northwest, passing over the Kaesong area towards the southeast. At 11:07 AM, eight American aircraft flew from the northwest, passing over the Kaesong area towards the southeast. At 1:01 PM, American aircraft circled over Kaesong. Due to weather conditions, the number and type of aircraft, as well as the flight direction, were unclear. At 1:05 PM, two American aircraft flew south over Kaesong. At 3:54 PM, five American aircraft flew from north, passing over Kaesong towards the south. At 4:25 PM, ten American aircraft flew from the northwest, passing over the Kaesong area towards the south. At 4:41 PM, four American aircraft flew from the northwest, passing over the Kaesong area towards the south. At 4:55 PM, three American aircraft flew over the Kaesong area. On January 26th, a total of five times. At 7:47 AM, six American jet aircraft flew from southeast, passing over Kaesong towards the northwest. At 7:41 AM, four American jet aircraft flew from southeast, passing over Kaesong towards the northwest. At 10:14 AM, the number of American aircraft was unknown, flying from north, passing over the Kaesong area towards the south. At 11:55 AM, six American aircraft flew over the Kaesong area. At 10:53 PM, one American aircraft circled over Kaesong. Due to weather conditions, the type of aircraft could not be seen clearly. On January 27th, a total of four times. At 8:20 AM, one American aircraft flew over Kaesong. At 10:24 PM, 10:26 PM, and 10:28 PM, each time there was one American aircraft circling over the Kaesong area.
    The opposing liaison officer, Murray, still attempted to conceal and quibble in various ways. Senior Colonel Chai solemnly pointed out: "Strictly abiding by every clause of the agreement is extremely important. Any unserious attitude towards the agreement will cause adverse consequences and serious incidents. I think you understand this point."
