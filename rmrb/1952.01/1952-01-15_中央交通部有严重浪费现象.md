    Serious Waste Phenomenon in the Central Ministry of Transportation
    Editor: The General Administration of Maritime Transport of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Transportation, in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, has exposed many instances of extravagance and waste in the Ministry of Transportation. The Ministry of Transportation once sent a telegram to the Beiyang Shipping Bureau requesting approximately two tons of apples. As a result, in addition to incurring a huge shipping cost, many apples spoiled. During a shipping conference convened by the Ministry of Transportation, sixteen roasted piglets were consumed; leftover food in the cafeteria was dumped in the sewers, accumulating oil several inches deep. The wood used for the floors of the Ministry of Transportation building was all shipped from the Philippines, and the shipping costs alone were astonishing. Zhang Wen'ang, the director of the General Office, often boasted about this to others. Over the past year, the Ministry of Transportation has spent a total of 5.8 billion yuan outside of the budget, which is equivalent to 150 percent of the annual profit created by two thousand workers in the Shanghai Shipyard. Based on these materials, some leading cadres in the Ministry of Transportation have been eroded by bourgeois ideology, and therefore consider such extravagance and waste to be the "generosity" and "largesse" of the People's Government. I hope that the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council will thoroughly investigate this matter in order to rectify this bad practice through this campaign.

    中央交通部有严重浪费现象
    编辑同志：中央人民政府交通部海运管理总局在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中，揭发了交通部很多铺张浪费现众。交通部曾去电向北洋海运局要苹果两吨左右。结果，除花了一笔巨大的运费外，还坏掉了许多苹果。交通部召开航务会议时，吃了烤小猪十六只；食堂里的剩菜都倒在阴沟里，积油数寸。交通部大楼地板所用的木料，全部是从菲律滨运来的，只运费就已经很可惊了。办公厅主任张文昂还常拿这事夸耀于人。一年来，交通部在制度外共开支了五十八亿元，等于上海修船厂两千个工人一年中所创造利润的百分之一百五十。从这些材料来看，交通部某些领导干部已被资产阶级的思想所侵蚀，因而对那样的铺张浪费，认为是人民政府的
    “大方”和“慷慨”。我希望中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会应彻底检查，以便通过这次运动来纠正这种恶劣的作风。　梁文
