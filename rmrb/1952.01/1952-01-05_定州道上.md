    On the Road to Dingzhou
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Huashan

    The decision to travel to the front lines by car during the day filled me with indescribable joy. The soldiers waiting for the car were also happy about this.

        “Earlier on this road, let alone cars running during the day, even walking alone required constant vigilance. Enemy planes were relentless, with their crazy antics. Now, they dare not come during the day. If they do, they sneak in, make a quick turn, and quickly slip away, afraid of being caught."

    "It's the same at night," another said. "They make a lot of noise, but our drivers have also become well-trained. No matter the bombing or blockade, they get through with a few twists and turns."

    "It's all thanks to the drivers being well-trained. Driving at night without lights, our drivers are truly world-class!"

    "Isn't that what's troubling the Americans? They've sent countless airborne spies to find out what medicine our drivers are taking to make their eyes so good. But they haven't found the recipe after a year of worrying. Turns out we're taking revolutionary medicine." This caused everyone to burst into laughter, and the inconclusive debate ended. We set off at noon.

    We took the Sinuiju-Anju highway. The highway and railway intertwined and meandered, extending southeast along the coast. Although this was already one of the few quasi-plains in Korea, we only saw mountains and not the sea on the four-hundred-li journey. The newly repaired road surface was wide and flat, and the trucks sped along as if on an asphalt road, without bouncing over the newly patched bomb craters. If it weren't for the ruins of towns and villages along the way, the train culverts riddled with bullet holes, the breach in the roadbed patched with straw bags, the cement bridge sections with wooden planks laid across them, and the scattered bomb craters nearby, it would be hard to believe that this was the transportation artery that the enemy's air force and navy had been frantically destroying for an entire year.

    Groups of women, children, and elderly people repairing the road flashed by. I remembered a labor party member's words: "We don't want happiness now, we only want victory; if there is any hope beyond victory, it is to repay the friendship of the Chinese people with victory." This strong will can be clearly seen in the endless road repair teams along the way. Groups of dozens of people, with simple tools, were working together as precisely as machines. I watched from the car for a full two hundred li, and didn't encounter a single pile of dirt blocking the road, even though sections of the new dirt road surface were always lying ahead, and some hadn't even had tire tracks on them. For the sake of victory, the strength of the Korean people is being organized bit by bit.

    The harvested fields stretched out on both sides, as neat and lovely as the wide highway. Fields extended one after another, and many rice paddies had already been winter-plowed. Even near the frequently bombed Dingzhou station, there was no wasteland. Korea is a mountainous country, but the hardworking people have turned barren slopes and deep valleys into paddy fields. During the war, the enemy's destruction was extremely malicious. In 1950 alone, when they reached forty kilometers south of Sinuiju, they killed or injured 8,033 residents in North Pyongan Province, robbed more than 13,300 head of cattle, 21,000 tons of grain, and burned down more than 16,600 houses. The farm tools of many farming families, even their carrying poles, were burned. In these difficult war days, the heroic Korean women and elderly people shouldered the heavy burden of restoring production and supporting the front lines. They used bomb casings to make hundreds of thousands of plows, hoes, shovels, and sickles. The elderly and children went to the fields together to pull plows, and more than 5,400 women became the main force in cultivating and harvesting. Although the labor force was less than half of what it was before the war, planting was completed twenty days earlier than last year, and public grain had already been fully paid by November 2nd. Now, they have repaired the road as neatly and smoothly as an asphalt road.

    In the evening, we stayed in a small village south of Dingzhou. The village was next to the highway, and the landlady where I stayed was a kind old mother. As soon as I entered, she had already cleaned the warm kang and was sitting next to the oil lamp, waiting with a smile. "Grandmother!" I greeted her in Korean, took off my shoes, and entered the room. This made her so happy that she spoke a great deal, as if asking if I was cold, if I had eaten, and welcoming me, but, looking at her talkative and kind manner, it was definitely more than just that. When she realized that I didn't understand, she made even more gestures, pointing to the photos on the wall in the inner room, patting the girl next to her who was knitting a white wool sweater, pointing to the four children sleeping side by side on the kang in the inner room, and finally holding up two fingers, patting her chest, and pointing to me, saying proudly, "Communist," I realized that her two sons were both labor party members, and the younger one had joined the People's Army. But what the older one did and how he was doing, I couldn't guess. I couldn't figure out if the girl was a daughter-in-law or a daughter, I only knew that she had just returned from road repair and was knitting a sweater for the front lines.

    Judging from this thatched house, her family definitely didn't just live with these few people. The kang mat was very shiny, a large bag of newly fluffed cotton was placed on the cabinet, and there were a total of five holes in the roof and cabinet made by airplane bullets, but no traces of bullet exits could be found on the walls, indicating that they had been replastered not long ago. I went outside the door with a flashlight: there were also piles of bean stalks, sorghum stalks, and half a cowshed of rice straw in the courtyard, which could not have been harvested by a teenage girl and a sixty-year-old mother alone. But it was already past nine o'clock, and still no one had returned. Lying on the kang, I couldn't figure it out.

    Cars were running back and forth on the highway. Enemy planes were bombing in the direction of Anju again, and strafing and bombing in the direction of Dingzhou. A series of gunshots rang out nearby, fired by the anti-aircraft sentry. The sound of enemy planes circling gradually approached. The oil lamp in the inner room was still lit, and the girl was knitting quietly. The car stopped for a moment and then started running again. Suddenly, the window paper shook, and a string of heavy bombs exploded somewhere. I had just fallen into a drowsy sleep, and was awakened again by a burst of machine gun fire, the sound of planes strafing very close, at most two li away. The cars kept running as usual, the girl kept knitting as usual, but "Grandmother" was already snoring soundly. Looking at the quiet lamplight on the wall, I remembered another "Grandmother."

    One evening in early January 1951, I was also going to the front lines. There was thick snow everywhere, and the mountain wind in the second half of the night was even stronger, covering everything from eyelashes to leather clothes and leather hats with frost. The car ran in the dark for most of the night, and it was time to find a place to stay. As soon as I turned on the light, several streams of bullets swept towards us, followed by boiling explosions and the strange howling of dive-bombing. After a period of tension, the mountains and fields returned to silence. We discovered a village at a turn, but all the houses were empty. I pushed open a door to take shelter from the wind. There was only a clay fire basin on the kang. I poked at the ashes and found embers. The kang mat wasn't icy either, not like a place where no one lived. But a chill pierced through my shoulders. It turned out that there were many bowl-sized bullet holes in the roof and thatched house. Just as I couldn't find anything to plug the holes, the door opened again, and a thin "Grandmother" appeared. She looked at the light of the candle in alarm, and suddenly blew it out, whispering, "Airplane! Airplane!..." It turned out that the villagers had heard the strafing, grabbed their quilts, and hid in the snow pits in the back gully. She had returned because she couldn't stand the cold, as the only quilt was just enough for her three young grandchildren to huddle around in the snow. In the darkness, she couldn't understand my words of comfort, and shrunk back uneasily. Suddenly, she grabbed my hands, pulled them to the fire basin, and held them tightly, rubbing them. Only a mother's heart would comfort someone like this in a moment of panic. She wanted to give me a little warmth, but her stiff fingers were also so cold. I didn't know how to comfort her. Now, in the same place next to the highway, enemy air raids are far more rampant than back then, but the snoring in the thatched house is so peaceful, and the sound of bombs shattering the window paper cannot disturb the sound sleep of the Korean old mother.

    I woke up at dawn, and the red sun filled the window. In 1950, at this time every day, the stove fire had already died out, and few people could be seen outdoors. Now, people chopping wood, fetching water, and threshing grain could be seen everywhere in the village.... Smoke was rising from the chimneys. The village, the caves, and the pine forests on the mountain were full of life.

    The landlady's daughter was also cooking—she turned around, but it wasn't her. Just as I was wondering, the girl from last night returned with a middle-aged man, holding a wooden stick.

    The middle-aged man greeted me, acting like a host. He was hospitable, taking out all the Chinese words and characters he knew to treat me—although it was difficult to talk. His tired face was always smiling. If he couldn't speak, he helped with a pen.

    His name was Li Long, the old mother's eldest son, forty-six years old, working in the cooperative and district government, often busy until dawn. Last night, he hadn't rested all night either. The one cooking was his brother's wife, twenty-four years old, who had been on sentry duty until the second half of the night before she came back to rest. Her post was taken over by the girl, half a night each. The girl was Li Long's eldest daughter, only nineteen years old. Their entire family's 2,300 pyeong of paddy fields and 4,000 pyeong of dry land were cultivated by the two of them, because the other children were all under nine years old, and Li Long was a relatively young government worker, and couldn't spare the time. The enemy had passed through here twice. The cattle were gone, and the hoe was made by breaking open a hexagonal incendiary bomb casing. The two young women often hoed until midnight, and the sixty-four-year-old mother and five-year-old daughter also went to the fields to pull weeds. Fortunately, the village women organized a "wartime work team," which harvested 3,000 jin of rice. Added to the dryland grain, after taking out half for public grain, there was still enough to eat for a year.

    After he finished telling me all this, the meal was also finished, and a bundle of straw ropes for weaving straw bags had also been twisted. Straw bags can be used to hold grain, hold soil, repair bridges, pave roads, and repair fortifications, and are also for the front lines. I said, "You should sleep, you're too tired!" But he smiled, put on his shoes, and picked up the farm tools for threshing grain. The girl also put down the white wool sweater she was knitting, put on a pair of grass-green broken overalls over her white pants, and went out with her young aunt.

    The sound of aerial combat suddenly rang out in the southern sky. The white smoke of jet planes streaked across the blue sky, spinning and swirling. White lines converged into a huge vortex—it was a good opportunity for the car to move forward. At this time, the enemy planes didn't dare to sneak down to low altitude to attack. However, our car was being dismantled and repaired, and couldn't move for a while. I went to a nearby yard to watch threshing, and saw Li Long and his daughter again.

    They were helping a neighbor thresh bean stalks. In another yard, his brother's wife was also helping two teenagers pound rice. This was a kind of labor mutual aid in the "wartime work team." By eleven o'clock, the car had not been repaired yet, and Li Long and his daughter had already arrived at the third threshing ground, only his brother's wife had returned home. I said, "You're working hard! Take a rest." She smiled and went into the house, and then brought out a liter of grain, poured it into the stone mortar, and lifted the wooden pestle to pound again....

    "That's how they work day and night!" I sat in the car and continued to move forward, and lines of road repair teams flashing white skirts flowed from the fields to the highway again.

    定州道上
    新华社记者  华山
    决定白天坐汽车上前方，心里有说不出的高兴。等车的战士们也为这事乐着。
        “早先这条路，不说白天跑汽车，单人空身走也得时刻提防着。敌人飞机从早到晚，看它那疯狂劲。现在它白天可不敢来啦。要来也是钻个空子，打个转就赶紧溜掉，生怕叫抓住似的。”
    “晚上也一样啊，”另一个说：“它闹得凶，咱司机也锻炼出来了。任它轰炸封锁，三钻两钻就过去了。”
    “说啥也是司机锻炼出来了。不打灯开夜车，咱司机真算世界第一！”
    “要不美国就为这发愁？不知派来多少空降特务，打听咱司机到底吃了什么药，眼睛这样好使。可是愁了一年也没找到这药方。原来咱是吃的革命药。”说得大家一阵哄笑，没有结果的争论就结束了。中午开车。
    走的是新义州——安州公路。公路和铁路交错蜿蜒，沿着海岸伸向东南。虽然这已经是朝鲜少有的准平原了，四百里的路上却只见山岳不见海。新修的路面宽阔平坦，卡车如同在柏油马路上一样，尽情地奔驰着，路过新补的弹坑也不蹦跳。要不是沿途躺着城镇乡村的废墟、弹痕累累的火车涵洞、补着草袋堰墙的路基缺口、横着木板桥面的洋灰断桥以及散乱在左近的炸弹深坑，很难看出这就是敌人空军和海军疯狂地破坏了整整一年的交通干线。
    路旁闪过一伙伙的正在修路的妇女、儿童和老人，我想起一个劳动党员的话来：“我们现在不要幸福，我们只要胜利；如果说胜利以外还有希望，那就是以胜利回答中国人民的友谊。”这种坚强的意志，从一路上没有尽头的修路队是可以清楚地看得出来的。几十人一伙，拿着简单的工具，却像机器一样准确地协同劳动着。我在车上看了整整二百里路，就没碰上一堆挡路的土堆，虽然一段段的新土路面总在前面横着，而且有的还是没压上汽车轮印的。为了胜利，朝鲜人民的力量一点一滴都组织起来了。
    秋收后的田野在两旁展开着，和坦阔的公路一样整齐可爱。阡陌连绵，好些稻田已经冬耕，连经常遭受轰炸的定州车站附近也没有荒地。朝鲜是个多山的国家，但是勤劳的人民却把荒坡深谷都修成了水田。在战争中，敌人的破坏是十分恶毒的，光是一九五○年打到新义州以南四十公里的时候，他们就在平安北道杀伤居民八千零三十三人，抢劫耕牛一万三千三百余头，粮食二万一千余吨，烧毁房屋一万六千六百余间，许多农家的农具连背架也被烧光了。就在这样困难的战争日子里，英勇的朝鲜妇女和老人肩负起了恢复生产、支援前线的重担。他们用炸弹皮打了几十万把犁头、镢头、铁锨和镰刀，老人、小孩一起下地拉犁，五千四百多个妇女成了耕耘收割的主力军。虽然劳动力不到战前一半，播种却比去年提早完成二十天，公粮也已在十一月二日全部缴清。现在，他们又把公路修得像柏油马路那样整齐平坦了。
    晚上，我们住在定州以南的一个小村庄里。村子紧挨着公路，我住的那家房东是位慈祥的老妈妈。一进门，她已经把暖炕打扫干净，笑咪咪地坐在油灯旁边等着了。“阿嬷尼！”我用朝鲜话打个招呼，脱鞋进屋。这只乐得她说了老大一篇话，好像是问我冷不冷，吃了饭没有，很欢迎我来等等，可是，看她那滔滔不绝的亲切样子，绝不止这点意思，等到她发现我并没有听懂的时候，她便打着更多的手势，一时指指里屋墙上的照片，一时拍拍身旁打着白毛线衣的少女，一时指指里屋炕上四个并排睡着的小孩，最后伸出两个手指，拍拍胸脯，又指指我，很得意地说了一声“共产党”，我才明白她的两个儿子都是劳动党员，而且小的参加了人民军。但大的在做什么，怎么样都猜不出来。少女是媳妇还是女儿也弄不清楚，只知道她刚刚修路回来，又在给前方织毛衣了。
    从这间草房看来，她家绝不止只住这几个人的。炕席很光亮，柜上放着一大包新弹过的棉花，房顶和柜子上共有五个被飞机子弹打穿的洞，墙壁上却找不到子弹出口的痕迹，显然是重新泥过不久的。到门外打着手电筒看看：院门里也堆着豆秸、高粱秸和半个牛栏的稻草，这绝不是一个十几岁的少女和一个六十多岁的老妈妈的劳动所能收获的。可是等到九点多钟，还不见人回来。睡在炕上，总是想不通。
    公路上来回跑着汽车。敌机又在安州方向轰炸了，定州方向也在扫射轰炸了。近处一连几响枪声，是防空哨打的，敌机盘旋的声音渐渐接近。里屋的油灯还在亮着，少女安静地打着毛衣。汽车停了一下又呼呼地跑起来。突然，窗纸一震，是一串重磅炸弹在什么地方爆炸着。刚刚矇眬睡去，又被一阵机枪震醒，是很近的飞机扫射声，顶多二里地。汽车照样跑着，少女照样打着毛衣，“阿嬷尼”却早已微鼾沉沉了。看着墙上幽静的灯影，我想起了另一个“阿嬷尼”来。
    一九五一年一月初的一个晚上，也是上前方，遍地厚雪，下半夜的山风更烈，从睫毛到皮衣皮帽都结满了霜花。汽车摸黑跑了大半宿，该找地方住了。刚一亮灯，几溜弹光迎头猛扫过来，沸腾的爆响，俯冲的怪啸——一阵紧张过去，山野又复静寂。拐弯处发现村庄了，只是房子全是空空的。推门进去避避风，炕上只有一只土抹的火盆，拨拨草灰，有火星，炕席也不冰手，不像没有人住的。只是一阵阵寒气刺透两肩，原来房顶和草房有着好些碗口大的弹孔。正找不到塞洞的东西，门又开了，是个瘦小的“阿嬷尼”。她惊惶地看着蜡头的亮光，忽然一口吹掉，低声叫道：“飞机！飞机！……”原来村里的人听到扫射，都捞上被子，躲到后山沟的雪窝里去了。她是冷得蹲不住才回来的，因为唯一的一床被子只够三个小孙子在雪里围着。黑暗中，她听不懂我宽慰她的话，不安地抽缩着。忽然，她抓住我的两手，拉到火盆上，紧握住搓揉起来。只有慈母的心，才会在惊魂不定的时候这样来抚慰人的。她想给我一点温暖，僵硬的手指却也是这么冰凉，我更不知道怎样安慰她才好。现在，同是在公路旁边，敌机夜袭远比那时猖狂，草房里的鼾声却是这么安静，震破窗纸的炸弹声也不能侵扰朝鲜老母亲的酣梦了。
    天亮醒来，红日满窗。一九五○年每天这个时候，灶火早已压死，户外也少见人影。现在村里却到处可以看到劈柴的、打水的、打场的……。炊烟正在冒着。村庄上、地洞旁、山上的松林里，到处一片生气。
    房东少女也正在做饭——她转过脸来，一看却不是她。正纳闷，昨晚的少女跟着一个中年男子回来了，手里拿着一根木棒。
    中年人和我打着招呼，俨然是个主人的样子。他殷勤好客，把他所知道的中国话和中国字都拿出来款待我了——虽然谈起来这样吃力。他疲劳的脸总在微笑，说不出就用笔帮忙。
    他叫李龙，就是老妈妈的大儿子，四十六岁了，在合作社和面（区）政府工作，经常忙到天亮，昨晚也是一宿没有休息。做饭的是他的兄弟的媳妇，二十四岁，昨晚放哨到后半夜才回来休息。她的哨就是少女接替的，一人半宿。少女是李龙的大女儿，才十九岁。全家二千三百坪水田和四千坪旱田，都由她们两个耕种，因为其余的小孩都在九岁以下，而李龙又是比较年轻的政府人员，抽不出空来。敌人曾经从这里过了两次。牛没有了，锄头是把六角形的烧夷弹壳破开打成的。两个青年妇女常常锄到半夜，六十四岁的老母亲和五岁的小女儿也下地拔草。好在村里妇女组织了“战时作业班”，对付打了三千斤稻子。加上旱地粮食，除了拿出一半缴公粮，还够吃一年的。
    他给我谈完这些，饭也吃完了，一捆织草袋的草绳也搓出来了。草袋可以装粮食、装土、修桥、铺路、修工事，也是给前线的。我说：“你睡睡吧，太累了！”他却微笑着穿上鞋，拿起了打场的农具。少女也放下手里织着的白毛线衣，在白裤子外面套上一条草绿色的破罩裤，跟着年轻的婶婶出去了。
    南方的天空突然响起空战的枪声，喷气机的白烟在蓝天上飞驰，打旋，一道道的白线聚成了巨大的漩涡——正是汽车前进的好机会，这时候敌机是不敢窜到低空来袭击的。可是，我们的汽车正在拆卸修理，一时还不能出动。我到不远处的一家院子去看打场，又看到了李龙父女。
    他们正在帮着邻居打豆秸。在另一家院子里，他的弟媳妇也正帮着两个少年舂米。这就是“战时作业班”的一种劳动互助。等到十一点钟，汽车还没修好，李龙父女已经到了第三家场院，只有他的兄弟媳妇回了家。我说：“辛苦啦！休息休息。”她微笑着走进屋去，又捧出一升谷子，倒在石臼里，举起木杵又捣起来。……
    “他们就是这样没白没黑的干啊！”我坐着汽车继续前进，一溜溜闪着白裙的修路队又从田野流向公路了。
