    Model of Hard Work, Simplicity, Integrity, and Public Service—Liu Changlu
    Written by: Ren Qianqiao, Sun Hanchun, Zhao Wenwei, Gong Mei, Chen Qi, Peng Bin
    (1) Comrade Liu Changlu is currently an administrative staff officer at the Cadre School of the Public Security Forces of the East China Military Region. He joined the army in 1945 and the Chinese Communist Party in 1946. When he first became a sergeant and was put in charge of managing food, the instructor told him: "We trust you very much, but economic work requires great attention to detail. We hope you clarify the economic procedures." He kept this firmly in mind and meticulously clarified the economic procedures with responsibility.
    (2) When the troops marched south, he realized that managing the food well was essential for consolidating the troops and improving their combat effectiveness. When the troops halted for rest during marches, he often braved blizzards to travel dozens of miles to buy reasonably priced vegetables and meat. Therefore, the food in their company at that time was relatively good compared to the entire regiment.
    (3) Not only was the food good in their company, but they also achieved great success in conservation. In the winter of 1947 alone, they saved 2,000 jin of wheat, 4,000 jin of coarse grains, and over 19,000 jin of firewood.

    （一）刘长禄同志，现在是华东军区公安部队干部学校的管理参谋。他在一九四五年参军，一九四六年参加中国共产党。他开始当上士、管理伙食的时候，指导员对他说：“我们很相信你，但是，做经济工作是要很细致的，希望你弄清经济手续。”他牢牢记在了心里，就谨慎负责地把经济手续搞得很清楚。
    （二）部队南下时，他认识到搞好伙食是巩固部队、提高战斗力的必要条件之一。当部队行军住下休息的时候，他常常冒着大风雪跑到几十里以外的地区，去买价钱公道的菜和肉。所以当时他们连队的伙食，在全团来说是比较好的。
    （三）他们连队不但伙食好，而且节约也很有成绩，仅在一九四七年冬，就节约了小麦两千斤、粗粮四千斤、柴一万九千多斤。
