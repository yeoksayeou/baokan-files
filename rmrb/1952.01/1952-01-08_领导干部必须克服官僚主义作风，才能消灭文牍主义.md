    Leading Cadres Must Overcome Bureaucratic Work Styles to Eliminate Red Tape
    Editor: After visiting the anti-red tape document exhibition, I have a deeper understanding of how red tape delays and harms work. I also work as a secretary in an organization, and I am writing down my two points of understanding. I think the reason why red tape still exists today is: First, it is inseparable from the work style of the heads of various organizations. For example, many of the documents in this exhibition involve "passing the buck" back and forth, and these documents have the instructions or signatures of leaders at all levels. In other words, these leading comrades are the main "players" on the "football team." Second, the secretary-generals or office directors of various organizations are often the key to determining the survival of red tape. Because the secretary-general or office director directly determines the "journey" of the documents. At the same time, they directly lead the work of the secretarial staff and have a decisive influence on their work attitude and methods (no matter how many old organization personnel there are). Therefore, I feel that although the exhibition has made severe criticisms of all kinds of red tape practitioners and has suggested some methods for overcoming red tape and improving work methods, such as using telephone contact more, holding meetings to discuss solutions to problems, and reducing the levels of organizations, it is not clear enough on the key issues. In order to effectively eliminate red tape, it is necessary to treat it as an important part of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy within the organization; mobilize the masses to conduct in-depth inspections from top to bottom, so as to establish new work styles and work systems on this basis, and thoroughly improve our organizational work.

### 领导干部必须克服官僚主义作风，才能消灭文牍主义

    领导干部必须克服官僚主义作风，才能消灭文牍主义
    编辑同志：我参观了反文牍主义公文展览会以后，对于文牍主义的误事害人，有了比较深刻的体会。我也是在机关里作秘书工作的，现把我自己的两点认识写出来。我觉得文牍主义在今天仍然得以存在的原因是：第一，这和各机关首长的工作作风是分不开的。如这次展览的文件，就有不少往来“踢皮球”的事，而这些文件上是有各级机关首长的批示或签字的。也就是说，这些领导同志是“足球队”的主要“队员”。第二，各机关的秘书长或办公厅（室）主任往往是决定文牍主义存亡的关键。因为秘书长或办公厅（室）主任直接决定文件的“旅程”。同时，他们直接领导秘书人员工作，对秘书人员的工作态度和工作方法有决定性的影响（不管旧机关人员怎样多）。因此，我觉得展览会虽然对于各式各样的文牍主义者作了严厉的批评，并在克服文牍主义、改进工作方法上提示了一些方法，如多用电话联系、开会磋商解决问题和减少机关层次等。但在关键问题上，提得还不够明确。为了有效地消灭文牍主义，有必要把它当作机关里面反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的一个重要内容；发动群众从上到下进行深入的检查，以便在这个基础上，建立起新的工作作风和工作制度，彻底改进我们的机关工作。    王文
