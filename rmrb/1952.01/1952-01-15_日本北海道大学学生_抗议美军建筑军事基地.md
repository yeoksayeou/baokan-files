Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese students in Hokkaido and Kyushu are united in opposing the U.S. military's construction of military bases in their respective regions.

    To build the Chitose military base in Hokkaido, the U.S. occupying forces attempted to lure a small number of Hokkaido University students from impoverished backgrounds into working on the base's construction. However, due to the struggle of patriotic students at Hokkaido University, this despicable scheme of the U.S. occupying forces ultimately failed. On October 13th of last year, the U.S. occupying forces even directed Japanese police to beat patriotic students and arrest two of them. This atrocity by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries aroused the anger of Hokkaido University students. They immediately gathered a thousand people, held a protest rally, and formally lodged a protest with the police authorities the next day. Now, the slogan "Police are not allowed to enter the school" has become a slogan for the joint struggle of students and professors at Hokkaido University.

    On Kyushu Island, the Itazuke Air Base (in Fukuoka Prefecture), a major base for the U.S. Air Force engaged in the Korean War, is located very close to Kyushu University. U.S. aircraft taking off from this air base harass Kyushu University constantly, disrupting students' studies. Therefore, the student self-governing associations of various colleges of Kyushu University submitted a petition to the Civil Information and Education Bureau of Ridgway's headquarters, demanding the prompt cessation of these harassing aircraft flights.

    日本北海道大学学生
    抗议美军建筑军事基地
    【新华社讯】东京消息：北海道和九州的日本学生一致反对美国在各该地区建筑军事基地。
    美国占领军为了建筑北海道的千岁军事基地，曾企图诱骗少数生活贫困的北海道大学学生从事建筑军事基地的工作。但是，在北海道大学爱国学生的斗争下，美国占领军的这一卑鄙勾当终于遭到失败。去年十月十三日，美国占领军竟指使日本警察殴打爱国学生，并逮捕其中两人。美、日反动派这一暴行激起了北海道大学学生的愤怒。他们当即集合了一千人，举行抗议大会，并在第二天正式向警察当局提出抗议。现在，“警察不准进入学校”这一口号已成为北海道大学的学生和教授联合斗争的口号。
    在九州岛，侵朝美国空军的主要基地板付机场（在福冈县）距离九州大学很近，从该机场起飞的美国飞机整天在九州大学的上空骚扰不息，妨碍学生的学习。因此九州大学各学院的学生自治会向李奇微总部的民间情报教育局提出了请愿书，要求迅速停止这种骚扰的飞机飞行。
