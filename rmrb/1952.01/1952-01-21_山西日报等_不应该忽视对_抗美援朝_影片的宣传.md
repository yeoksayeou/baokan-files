    To the Editors of the Shanxi Daily and Others:
    The Shanxi Daily and Others Should Not Neglect the Promotion of "Resist America, Aid Korea" Films

    Editor: I arrived in Taiyuan on November 27th. That evening, the Shanxi Film Management Company invited representatives from the Shanxi Provincial Department of Culture and Education's Film Management Office, the Shanxi Daily, the Shanxi Provincial Broadcasting Station, and the Resist America, Aid Korea branch to a joint meeting with the managers of the six major cinemas in Taiyuan to discuss the promotion of "Resist America, Aid Korea" films. Despite several phone calls from the Film Management Company, the Resist America, Aid Korea branch did not send anyone to the meeting. The broadcasting station also did not participate. At the meeting, I first introduced the production process of the "Resist America, Aid Korea" films and the heroic deeds of the volunteers on the Korean battlefield. The cinema managers all expressed their intention to attract more viewers during the film's screening period and guaranteed that the equipment would function properly and that the lighting and sound would be good. The manager of the Youth Cinema suggested that the reporter from the Shanxi Daily attending the meeting should report back to the newspaper and find ways to expand the film's promotion. The reporter agreed. However, during the film's screening period, the Shanxi Daily did not provide any written promotion at all. The Shanxi Daily published a preview of the "Resist America, Aid Korea" film on December 26th, but on December 27th (the day before the performance), the newspaper stopped the preview for one day and placed an advertisement for Darkie Toothpaste in the film advertisement column.

    The Shanxi Daily believes that promoting films in the newspaper is to increase revenue for the cinemas and does not see film promotion as a political task. The Shanxi Resist America, Aid Korea branch also does not attach enough importance to this issue. During the film's screening period, they did not organize the masses to watch it. From December 28th to January 6th, Taiyuan screened the "Resist America, Aid Korea" film, but out of a city of over 500,000 people, only over 90,000 people watched it. I believe that the local Party committee's propaganda department should bear considerable responsibility for this phenomenon.

### 山西日报等  不应该忽视对“抗美援朝”影片的宣传

    山西日报等
    不应该忽视对“抗美援朝”影片的宣传
    编辑同志：我十一月二十七日到了太原。当天晚上，由山西影片经理公司请山西省文教厅电影管理处、山西日报社、山西省广播电台、抗美援朝分会的代表，和太原六大电影院的经理同志开“抗美援朝”影片宣传的联席会。抗美援朝分会虽经影片经理公司数次电话联系，但仍没有派人参加会议。广播电台也没有参加会。在这个会议上，我首先把“抗美援朝”影片摄制经过，和志愿军在朝鲜战场上的英雄事迹介绍了一下，各电影院经理都表示要在影片放映期中，争取更多的观众，并保证机器不出毛病，光线和声音情况良好。青年电影院经理提出：请参加会议的山西日报社记者回去向报社反映，要设法扩大影片的宣传。那位记者同志也表示同意。可是在影片放映期间，山西日报根本就没有作一点文字宣传。山西日报十二月二十六日刊登了“抗美援朝”影片的预告，但到了二十七日（演出前一天），报纸上停了一天预告，把黑人牙膏的广告登在电影广告栏中。
    山西日报社认为在报纸上宣传电影，那是为电影院增加收入，并没有把电影宣传看作是一种政治任务。山西抗美援朝分会对这个问题重视的也不够，在影片放映期中，他们一直都没有组织群众去看。从十二月二十八日到一月六日太原放映“抗美援朝”影片，全市五十多万人口，只九万多观众。这种现象，我认为当地党委宣传部门应负相当的责任。
