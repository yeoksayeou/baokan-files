In the large-scale anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy great struggle, the active participation of financial department workers has special significance. The financial department is an agency that represents the state in supervising finances, managing budgets, and controlling income and expenditure. Therefore, financial staff should set an example, strictly abide by the system, be honest and dedicated, and become models of thrift. If financial staff cannot do this, they cannot fulfill the glorious responsibilities entrusted to them by the state. The facts of the past two years have proven that the vast majority of financial staff in New China are honest and dedicated and work hard. They have fulfilled their responsibilities and made great contributions to the country in unifying national finance, balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure, and supporting the Resist-America, Aid-Korea campaign and various construction projects. However, the facts of the past two years have also proven that serious corruption and waste, as well as bureaucratic work styles, also exist in our financial departments. This not only harms the financial departments themselves but also directly or indirectly encourages corruption and waste in other departments. Therefore, in the national anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, as the financial department that supervises the implementation of the national financial system, its anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign is of even greater significance.

What corruption and waste phenomena and bureaucratic work styles currently exist in the financial department?

In terms of corruption, there are roughly the following types: selling financial intelligence, such as changes in tax rules and tax rates, and the reserve prices for auctioned materials; colluding with unscrupulous merchants to steal state assets; creating false reports and fake receipts to defraud state assets; using their power to extort; covering up smuggling and tax evasion; accepting bribes and kickbacks; embezzling public funds and property for personal gain; and misappropriating public funds and property for profit. According to the statistics of the Southwest Finance Department alone, in the past two years, the number of corrupt personnel discovered in the Southwest financial system reached 4,816, embezzling 32.3 billion yuan in cash and 40 million catties of grain. Is this not enough to illustrate the seriousness of the problem?

In terms of waste, due to the characteristics of the financial department, the phenomenon of waste in the financial department is often linked to actions that violate financial discipline and financial systems. Actions that violate financial discipline and financial systems appear in a variety of forms. For example: superiors deducting from subordinates, subordinates deceiving superiors; creating false budgets and false certificates; laying ambushes and collecting empty salaries; underreporting income and overreporting expenses; taking state assets under the pretext of improving living standards and engaging in large-scale "small household affairs"; misappropriating operating expenses as agency expenses; creating false accounts, diverting funds to different categories, and falsely reporting and claiming expenses, etc. Although these actions are not purely for personal gain, they squander state assets and directly contribute to waste. This is extremely harmful to the country.

In the financial department, bureaucratic and liberal work styles also exist seriously. Some financial staff sit in their offices all day, obsessively focusing on numbers, but rarely go down to investigate and study, so some systems are formulated that are not practical and cannot solve problems, this is one aspect; on the other hand, because they do not understand the actual situation, they conduct audits based only on subjective imagination, and thus unconsciously approve more budgets, which often results in "grabbing sesame seeds and losing watermelons," causing huge losses to the country.

The occurrence of the above phenomena is not accidental. First of all, it is due to the erosion of the working people of the people's government by the bad style of the reactionary ruling class. As everyone knows, in the Kuomintang reactionary government, almost "no official was not corrupt," and the financial department of the Kuomintang government was even worse than other departments. Manipulating prices, speculation and profiteering, heavy taxation and extortion, robbery and sale, exploitation and plunder, embezzlement, obtaining foreign exchange by deception, and public bribery, etc., were their actual "systems." Since the national liberation, the people's government has retained a large number of personnel from the old financial institutions. After education and transformation, this situation has undergone fundamental changes. However, the bad style of the Kuomintang reactionary government has been brought to the financial department of the people's government in a tangible or intangible way, seriously corrupting some of our departments and some of our personnel. Secondly, looking at the cadres of the national financial system, retained employees and newly employed personnel account for about 70%, and cadres from the old liberated areas account for about 30%. The vast majority of newly employed personnel can work hard to serve the people, but the bad habits of the old society that they have contracted are often not quickly eradicated, and some individuals have not been transformed at all, and continue to engage in theft and sabotage in a passive and resistant way. Although the vast majority of financial cadres from the old liberated areas have the fine traditions of diligence, thrift, and hard work, they have developed some bad work styles and habits due to being in a decentralized rural environment and war environment for a long time. For example: some people do not pay enough attention to the system and often handle affairs based on the approval slips of the leaders; some people do not calculate carefully and only use "political principles" and "conscience" to deal with problems; some people lack an overall perspective and have a fairly serious departmentalism. These phenomena have changed in the past two years, and some comrades have changed very well, but the changes are uneven and still exist seriously in some places or agencies, thus contributing to corruption and waste. Again, because the financial department is entrusted by the state with the power to control income and expenditure, and directly manages money and materials, that is, the so-called "easy access to the moon near the water," there are more opportunities for corruption and waste than in other departments. More importantly, due to the lack of political atmosphere in the financial system in the past two years, the ideological transformation of retained personnel has not been done well enough, and the learning and improvement of old cadres has also been poor. In some places, they have even adopted an attitude of appeasement, tolerance, or collusion with corrupt and degenerated elements, not only failing to give them the punishment they deserve in a timely manner, but some have even fallen into the water themselves. This is the main reason why the phenomenon of corruption and waste in the financial department still exists seriously today.

Therefore, it is extremely necessary to launch a vigorous, swift, and mass-based anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in the financial department.

According to the experience of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, the central key to carrying out this campaign lies in "leaders taking responsibility and setting an example," openly examining themselves, mobilizing the masses, and isolating a small number of corrupt elements. And under the condition of fully mobilizing the masses, the following issues must be thoroughly resolved:

First, thoroughly criticize various incorrect thoughts among financial staff. For example, some people say: "I underreport income and overreport expenditure in order to 'be loose in budgeting'," this kind of person actually wants to keep the money by their side, so that they can take it for their own use conveniently, and are unwilling to be careful and meticulous, and the result will inevitably form "loose budgeting and loose spending", contributing to corruption and waste. Some people hold "flexibility thoughts," and the "flexibility" they demand is only the "flexibility" of local and agency funds, which inevitably undermines the interests of the state and all the people, and makes it impossible for state assets to be used in a planned and centralized way. There are also people who have "privilege thoughts," and want to use more of it because they are in charge of the money. Even the system they have personally formulated is not implemented by themselves, and this kind of law enforcement and law destruction behavior will inevitably lead to waste. There is also a kind of person who has serious liberalist thoughts, accommodating without principle, and approving more budgets to "take care of emotions," "build relationships," and "improve relations." They do not understand that the implementation of financial policy must go through struggle, and only by adhering to the principled stand and conducting serious struggles against corruption, waste, violations of the system, and violations of discipline can the glorious tasks entrusted to the financial department be completed.

Second, corruption and waste in the financial system generally occur in departments that directly manage property, such as materials management, taxation, grain, salt affairs, and tobacco and alcohol monopoly departments, as well as the general affairs departments of various agencies and agency production units. Therefore, special emphasis should be placed on inspecting these departments and units. Departments and leadership aspects that indirectly control property and review budgets and final accounts should focus on checking bureaucracy and liberalism; agency secretariat departments should focus on checking red tape. And these serious phenomena in the financial department are often inseparable from the waste or corruption phenomena in other departments. Therefore, all localities should use the financial department as a hub to mobilize various departments at the same level to inspect each other in order to expand the results.

Third, after this great struggle, the financial department should earnestly revise and implement various financial systems. All systems that existed in the past but were not practical should be revised; all systems that need to be established but have not been established should be added immediately; all systems that are already sound but have not been seriously implemented should be seriously implemented immediately. In financial work, the main thing is to adhere to and implement the budget and final account system and the accounting system; to establish and improve the enterprise financial management system; to strictly implement the financial supervision system; and to revise and implement the salary and supply system. This will prevent the occurrence of corruption and waste on the one hand, and solve the necessary and possibly solvable problems in terms of certain living expenses on the other hand.

Financial departments at all levels and all financial staff should have full determination and confidence to make the face of our financial work焕然一新 in the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. If we cannot achieve results in financial work, then all thorough reforms and major constructions are unimaginable. It is hoped that the leading organs in various places will earnestly strengthen the leadership of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in the financial department. It is hoped that all financial staff will stand more consciously at the forefront of the campaign, and thoroughly transform their own thinking in the campaign, so that the financial department can more responsibly fulfill its responsibility of representing the state in supervising finance, so as to benefit the construction cause of our great motherland.

    怎样在财政系统中开展反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动
    在大规模的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争中，财政部门工作人员的积极参加具有特殊的意义。财政部门是代表国家监督财政、管理预算、掌握收支的机关。因此，财政工作人员更应以身作则，严守制度、廉洁奉公、成为节约的模范。如果财政工作人员不能做到这一点，就不能履行国家所赋予他们的光荣职责。两年来的事实证明，新中国的财政工作人员绝大部分是廉洁奉公、艰苦奋斗的。他们在统一全国财政、平衡财政收支、支持抗美援朝和各种建设工作中，是尽了自己的职责的，对国家有很大的贡献。但两年来的事实同样也证明，在我们的财政部门中也存在着严重的贪污浪费现象和官僚主义作风。它不仅危害到财政部门本身，而且直接间接地助长了其他部门的贪污浪费。因此，在全国各部门的反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中，作为监督执行国家财政制度的财政部门，其反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，更有重要意义。
    目前在财政部门中，存在着那些贪污浪费现象和官僚主义作风呢？
    在贪污方面，大体上有以下几种：出卖财政情报，如税则税率的变动、拍卖物资的底价等；勾结奸商盗取国家资财；造假报告、假单据，骗取国家资财；利用职权，敲诈勒索；包庇走私漏税；受贿赂，吃“回扣”；侵吞公款公物，据为己有；挪用公款公物，从中牟利等。仅据西南财政部的统计，两年来西南财政系统中已发现的贪污人员数达四千八百一十六人，贪污现款三百二十三亿元、粮食四千万斤。这还不足以说明问题严重的程度吗？
    在浪费方面，由于财政部门所具有的特点，就使财政部门的浪费现象，经常与破坏财政纪律、违反财政制度的行为相联系着。破坏财政纪律违反财政制度的行为，是以多种多样的形式出现的。譬如：上级克扣下级，下级欺瞒上级；造假预算、假证件；打埋伏，吃空名；收入以多报少，开支以少报多；藉口改善生活，套取国家资财，大搞“小家务”；挪用事业费充作机关开支；造假账，流用科目，虚报冒领等等。这些行为虽不是单纯为了个人，却虚耗了国家资财，直接助长了浪费。这对于国家的危害是十分严重的。
    在财政部门中，官僚主义和自由主义的作风也严重存在着。有些财政工作人员整天坐在屋里，死扣数字，却很少下去调查研究，因而某些制度订得不切实际，解决不了问题，这是一方面；另一方面，由于不了解实际情况，只凭主观想像进行审计，这样不自觉地多批了预算，其结果往往是“抓了芝麻，丢了西瓜”，给国家造成巨大的损失。
    以上种种现象的发生，并不是偶然的。首先，它是由于反动统治阶级的恶劣作风对人民政府工作人民的侵蚀。众所周知，在国民党反动政府中几乎是
    “无官不贪”的，而国民党政府的财政部门则较其他部门更甚。诸如操纵物价、投机倒把、横征暴敛、劫收盗卖、巧取豪夺、侵吞中饱、套取外汇、公行贿赂等等，乃是他们实际的“制度”。自从全国解放，人民政府留用了旧的财政机关的大批人员，经过教育改造之后，这种情况已有了基本的变化。但国民党反动政府的恶劣作风却有形无形地被带到人民政府的财政部门中来，严重地腐蚀着我们的某些部门和某些人员。其次，从全国财政系统的干部来看，留用的职员和新参加工作的人员约占百分之七十左右，从老解放区来的干部约占百分之三十左右。新参加工作的人员绝大部分都能努力为人民服务，但他们所沾染的旧社会的不良作风，往往不能迅速根除，其中个别人员则还根本没有改造，阳奉阴违地继续进行盗窃破坏。来自老解放区的财政干部虽然绝大多数具有勤俭朴素、艰苦奋斗的优良传统，但是，由于长期处在分散的农村环境和战争环境，养成了若干不良的作风和习惯。譬如：有些人对制度重视不够，多凭首长批条子办事；有的人不算细账，只凭“政治原则”和“良心”来处理问题；有的人缺乏全局观点，本位主义相当严重。这些现象，二年来是有转变的，且有些同志转变得很好，但是，转变是不平衡的，在某些地方或机关中还严重存在着，因而就助长了贪污浪费。再次，由于财政部门被国家赋予掌握收支的权力，又直接经管着钱财和物资，即所谓“近水楼台先得月”，贪污浪费的机会就比别的部门较多。更重要的是由于二年来财政系统缺乏政治空气，对留用人员思想改造工作做得不够，老干部的学习提高也较差，有的地方甚至对贪污蜕化分子采取了姑息宽容或同流合污的态度，不但没有及时予以应有的惩处，有的人连自己也堕落下水了。这就是财政部门中贪污浪费现象至今严重存在的主要原因。
    因此，在财政部门开展一个大张旗鼓的、雷厉风行的、群众性的反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动，是极为必要的。
    根据中央人民政府财政部的经验，开展这个运动的中心关键在于“首长负责，以身作则”，公开检查自己，发动群众，孤立少数贪污分子。而在充分发动群众的条件下，必须彻底解决以下几个问题：
    第一，彻底批判财政工作人员中各种不正确的思想。譬如有人说：“我少报收入，多报支出是为了‘宽打窄用’”，这种人实际上是想把钱放在身边，自己取用方便，不愿精打细算，其结果必然形成“宽打宽用”，助长了贪污浪费。有的人抱着“机动思想”，他们所要求的“机动”只是本地方、本机关用款的“机动”，这就必然破坏了国家与全体人民的利益，使国家的资财不能有计划地集中使用。还有的人存在着“特权思想”，自己管钱，就想多用一些。甚至自己亲手拟订的制度，自己不执行，这种执法毁法的行为，必然形成浪费。还有一种人存在着严重的自由主义思想，无原则地迁就，以多批预算去“照顾情绪”，“联络感情”，“搞好关系”。他们不了解财政政策的贯彻，是必须经过斗争的，只有坚持原则立场，向贪污浪费、违犯制度、破坏纪律等等行为进行严肃的斗争，才能完成国家赋予财政部门的光荣任务。
    第二，财政系统的贪污、浪费一般是产生于直接掌管财物的部门，如物资管理、税务、粮食、盐务、烟酒专卖等部门和各机关的总务部门、机关生产等单位。因此，对这些部门和单位应特别着重进行检查。间接掌握财物、审核预决算的各部门和领导方面，应着重检查官僚主义和自由主义；机关秘书部门则应着重检查文牍主义。而财政部门的这些严重现象又往往和其他部门的浪费或贪污现象不可分。因此，各地都应该以财政部门为枢纽，发动同级各部门互相检查，以扩大战果。
    第三，经过这个伟大斗争之后，财政部门应切实修订和贯彻执行各项财政制度。凡过去有制度而不切实际的，应加以修订；凡需要订立制度而未订立的，应即增订；凡已有妥善制度而未认真贯彻执行的，应即认真贯彻执行。在财政工作中，主要是坚持和贯彻预决算制度和会计制度；建立和健全企业财务管理制度；严格实行财务监督制度；修订和贯彻执行薪资和供给制度。这样一方面防止贪污浪费情况的发生，一方面解决某些生活费用方面必需和可能解决的问题。
    各级财政部门和一切财政工作人员，要有充分的决心和信心，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争中，使我们财政工作的面貌焕然一新。如果我们不能在财政工作上获得成效，则一切彻底的改革和重大的建设，都是不可想像的。希望各地领导机关，切实加强对于财政部门反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的领导。希望全体财政工作人员更加自觉地站在运动的最前列，并在运动中彻底改造自己的思想，使财政部门更加负责地履行代表国家监督财政的职责，以利于我们伟大祖国的建设事业。
