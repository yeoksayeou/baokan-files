To our beloved Chairman Mao: Under your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party, we have victoriously passed through 1951. Over the past year, in the midst of the fervent movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and patriotic production competitions, we have demonstrated a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm and actively responded to the call for increasing production and practicing economy. As of the end of 1951, we had completed our annual production task, exceeding the 1950 production task by more than 90 percent; in addition to completing the repair and fitting tasks of mining machinery, we also manufactured 34 kinds of products. The 325-horsepower electric locomotive DC motor is one of them. This motor rotates 620 revolutions per minute, with a vehicle speed of 276 kilometers per hour. In the quality inspection movement, we solved 25 major key quality problems of machines and adopted 1,320 rationalization proposals. We have started to produce ductile iron, vigorously promoted the advanced work methods of Kovalev and high-speed cutting methods, and implemented a piece-rate wage system. This has greatly improved production efficiency and reduced costs by 14 percent as planned. The turnover period of working capital has been shortened by 241 days compared to 1950.

Although we have achieved these results, there are still many shortcomings in our work. We have not completely eliminated defective products; there are still many problems in ensuring the repair and fitting tasks of the mine. Therefore, we must not be arrogant and must strive to improve all aspects of our work with a spirit of continuous effort, strengthen the repair and manufacture of mining machinery, and continue to struggle for the glorious tasks of increasing production and practicing economy, consolidating national defense, and resisting America and aiding Korea.

Taiyuan City Water Company Employees Clear Out Useful Machines Worth Over 500 Million Yuan
To our beloved Chairman Mao: Under your great call for increasing production and practicing economy, we have launched a vigorous movement to clear assets, verify funds, and oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. We have achieved preliminary results. This is another victory for all employees under your wise leadership. As the new year begins, we would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you and the people of the whole country.

Our company has many power machines, but only a broken black oil engine was recorded in the accounts. Recently, after inspection and appraisal, we found six diesel engines with a total of 267 horsepower (five of which can be started with minor repairs, and only one is severely damaged), with a total value of more than 500.4 million yuan. Regarding the important equipment for production - the water distribution network, we have always been unaware of its length and location in the past (because the Japanese invaders burned the map when they surrendered). After this asset clearing, with the strong assistance of the people of the city, we have basically clarified the situation within fifteen days and started to draw sketches. This is also a great improvement in the city's tap water management.

Over the past year, through the movements of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and democratic reforms, our political awareness has been greatly improved. We have launched a heated labor competition. We overfulfilled the annual production task by 37 percent; there were no accidents throughout the year; we ensured the water supply for industry and citizens; we gave full play to the machine's capabilities, reduced power consumption, and reduced costs by 11 percent compared to 1950. The value we created throughout the year increased by 15 percent compared to 1950.

We will consolidate our achieved victories and continue to carry out the movements of clearing assets, verifying funds, and opposing corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to meet the great upsurge of production and construction.

    抚顺矿务局机电厂职工去年完成的生产任务超过前年百分之九十
    敬爱的毛主席：我们在您和共产党的领导下，已经胜利地度过了一九五一年。一年来，我们在热火朝天的抗美援朝和爱国主义生产竞赛运动中，发挥了高度的爱国主义劳动热忱，并积极地响应了增产节约的号召。截至一九五一年末，我们完成了全年的生产任务，超过了一九五○年生产任务百分之九十以上；其中除完成了矿山机械的修配任务外，还制造出三十四种产品。三二五马力电机车直流电动机即是其中的一种。这部电动机每分钟转六百二十转，每小时车行速度二百七十六公里。在质量检查运动中，我们解决了二十五种机器质量上的重大关键问题，采纳了一千三百二十件合理化建议。我们已开始生产球墨铸铁，大力地推广郭瓦廖夫先进工作方法和高速切削法，并实行了计件工资制度。这便使生产效率大大提高，使成本也按照计划降低百分之十四，流动资金周转期较一九五○年缩短了二百四十一天。
    我们虽有这些成绩，但在工作上还存在着不少的缺点，还没有完全消灭废品；保证矿山修配任务中还有许多问题。因此，我们绝不能骄傲，要用再接再厉的精神努力提高各项工作，加强矿山机械的修配和制造，为增产节约，巩固国防，抗美援朝的光荣任务而继续奋斗。

    太原市自来水公司全体职工清理出值五亿余元的有用机器
    敬爱的毛主席：在您的伟大的增产节约号召下，我们展开了轰轰烈烈的清理资产、核定资金和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。我们已取得了初步的成绩。这是全体职工在您英明领导下的又一次胜利。值此新的一年开始的时候，谨以此向您和全国人民祝贺。
    我公司有许多动力机械，但在账上只记载着破烂不全的一部黑油发动机。最近我们经过检查和鉴定，查出柴油发动机六部，共二百六十七匹马力（其中五部稍加整修就可开动，只有一部损坏较大），总计价值五亿零四百多万元。关于生产上的重要设备——配水管网，我们在过去一向不知道它的长度和位置（因为日寇投降时把图烧了）。经过此次清理资产，加上本市人民的大力协助，我们在十五天内已基本弄清情况，并着手绘制草图。这在城市的自来水管理上，也是一个很大的进步。
    一年来，通过抗美援朝、镇压反革命、民主改革运动，我们的政治觉悟大为提高。我们展开了热烈的劳动竞赛。我们超额百分之三十七，完成了全年生产任务；一年内没有出事故；保证了工业和市民的用水；充分发挥了机器能力，减低了用电，使成本比一九五○年减低百分之十一。我们全年创造的价值较一九五○年提高百分之十五。
    我们将巩固已得的胜利，继续开展清理资产、核定资金以及反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，以迎接伟大的生产建设的高潮。
