Xinhua News Agency, 28th. The Beijing Municipal Third People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee and the Municipal People's Government Committee held an expanded joint meeting on the eve of the Spring Festival (26th). The meeting discussed further development of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and the movement in industry and commerce against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and theft of state economic intelligence.

The meeting first heard a report from Liu Ren, Director of the Beijing Municipal Thrift and Inspection Committee, on the progress of the movement. After analyzing the overall picture of the movement in government agencies, enterprises, mines, schools, and people's organizations with specific figures, Liu Ren said: "From the corruption cases that have been discovered, the following main characteristics can be seen: a large proportion of corrupt elements are retained personnel, and more than 80 percent are related to industry and commerce, some of whom are capitalists themselves, and some are agents of capitalists. This characteristic illustrates a situation: how rampant the bourgeoisie has been in attacking our revolutionary ranks in the past three years, and how seriously the poisons left over from the old society are eroding our state machine." He said: "After nearly a month of efforts, the movement in agencies, organizations, factories, mines, and schools has been launched, and the masses have been mobilized. Most of the people who committed minor corruption and took small advantages have confessed. However, there are still many serious corrupt elements who refuse to confess or do not confess thoroughly. For these major corrupt officials, in addition to some who have been arrested and dealt with according to law, various units are now concentrating their efforts to encircle and suppress them, and the movement is becoming more in-depth." Liu Ren then reported on the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-theft of state property movement in industry and commerce. He said: "The confessions and reports received have reached 110,000, involving more than 30,000 industrial and commercial households, accounting for more than 60 percent of the city's industrial and commercial households. Among them, there are 122 households that bribed state officials to steal state property, smuggle and evade taxes, causing the state to lose more than 100 million yuan. According to rough statistics, the state's losses have reached more than 109.8 billion yuan. In order to make those capitalists who have harmed the country and the people realize their mistakes and give them a chance to repent and start anew, the People's Government has repeatedly postponed the inspection date. However, even now, there are still many people who do not confess, or do not confess thoroughly, or even resist and sabotage the movement. For these people, the奸商刘元敬 traitorous merchant Liu Yuanjing, who was arrested and dealt with according to law, is their example. We will resolutely and unswervingly carry out the movement to the end according to the instructions of the Central Committee, no matter how long it takes. It is impossible for anyone to try to escape by luck."

The meeting then heard three reports from Li Leguang, Deputy Director of the Beijing Higher Education Thrift and Inspection Committee, Fu Huating, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Feng Jiping, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau.

Li Leguang reported on the situation of carrying out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in Beijing universities and colleges. He said: "In the beginning, the leaders of many educational institutions had incorrect understanding, thinking that they were 'clean as a whistle', 'had no corruption to be greedy for, no waste to be extravagant with, and no bureaucracy to be official with'. However, after the masses were mobilized and the movement was initially launched, serious phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy were revealed. Everyone was shocked to realize that schools were no exception. Only then did they begin to face the movement squarely, begin to review, criticize, and self-criticize, and begin to truly promote democracy. Now the movement in universities and colleges is underway."

Fu Huating reported on the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-theft of state property movement in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles. He said: "This propaganda and mobilization work has been more widespread and in-depth than any previous one, and it can be said that it is known to every household. However, the depth of the movement is still not enough, and the development is extremely uneven. In particular, some industries and merchants with more and bigger problems have not yet seriously confessed." Finally, he said that he would use the opportunity of the ten-day suspension of the inspection during the Spring Festival to further mobilize and strive for more illegal industrial and commercial operators to confess, repent, and start anew.

Feng Jiping reported on the situation of carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the municipal public security department. He focused on introducing the experience of organizing working groups to go directly into the 253 police station jurisdictions in the city and adopting the policy of all police station personnel avoiding the masses to report. He said: "This time the working group went down was very timely. Just as the movement in the agencies reached a climax, and a large-scale inspection was being launched on illegal industrial and commercial operators, the working group went down, cooperated with each other, and echoed each other, forming a pincer attack on corrupt and bribe-taking elements."

After the reports, the conference discussed. Those who spoke included Tang Yongtong, Pu Jiexu, Wang Zhixiang, Ling Qijun, Zheng Yun, Xu Chubo, Zhang Hongshun, Li Guorui, Shu Sheyu (Lao She), Cao Xianbo, Chen Mingde, Su Min, and Zhu Changjiang, members of the Municipal Consultative Committee and members of the Municipal People's Government. The speakers all combined their own experiences in the movement to explain the necessity and great educational significance of carrying out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Shu Sheyu said: "The educational significance of the movement for me personally is too great. I originally felt that I had no bureaucracy at all, and could drink and eat with tricycle workers, but I didn't care how the accountants in our agency made money. This movement made me understand that I also have bureaucracy. So-called 'self-cultivation' is only cleaning oneself, but it cannot prevent others from being corrupt." Zhang Hongshun, Li Guorui, Cao Xianbo and others, in their speeches, represented the workers of various industrial and mining enterprises in advocating strict punishment for illegal industrial and commercial operators who dared to obstruct and sabotage the movement.

Finally, Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee and Mayor of Beijing, made a summary. Peng Zhen said: The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the past month has achieved great results. However, it is still very incomplete. In particular, the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and theft of economic intelligence in the industrial and commercial circles is only a good start, and it is still far from completely completing the task. There must be no complacency or relaxation. Regarding the development of the movement in agencies, factories, organizations, and schools during this period, Peng Zhen pointed out that the main reason was the implementation of the policy of leading cadres taking the lead in making self-criticism and fully promoting democracy. In many units where the movement has been carried out better, all kinds of problems, big and small, have been exposed and properly resolved. Therefore, the work enthusiasm of the staff has been unprecedentedly high, and the atmosphere has been completely renewed. On the contrary, the work has not improved. In the future, we must further carry out criticism and self-criticism between superiors and subordinates, between various departments, and between leading comrades, clarify all problems, eliminate all estrangement, strengthen unity on the basis of complete ideological agreement, and earnestly improve our work and strengthen the relationship between the government and the people. Regarding the movement in industrial and commercial circles during this period, Peng Zhen believes that the vast number of workers, shop assistants, and some responsible persons of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce have made active efforts and have also achieved certain results. However, most of those who truly confess voluntarily are still small and medium-sized illegal industrial and commercial households. Those with bigger problems mostly do not confess thoroughly, and so-called confessions mostly avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, and try to muddle through. The final facts will prove that they are only making trouble for themselves. Peng Zhen said: The national bourgeoisie has a positive side and a negative side; there are places where it is in line with the interests of the people, and there are also places where it is contrary to the interests of the people. The actions of some illegal elements in the industrial and commercial circles fully prove that they are thieves of the country and the people. They unscrupulously encroach on, steal, and defraud the country's property, and use all means to corrupt state officials. We must never allow this phenomenon to continue. In order to protect our motherland, in order to protect the interests of all the people, and also in order to protect the legitimate operations of law-abiding industrial and commercial operators, we must continue to resolutely crack down on those illegal industrial and commercial operators, and not allow them to infringe on the interests of the people and steal state property; we only allow them to take the road of new democracy, and do not allow them to take the road against new democracy; we only allow them to abide by the law, and do not allow them to violate the law. Finally, he said: Our anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement and the industrial and commercial circles' anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state property and shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement must continue to adopt voluntary confession and self-criticism, especially the mass reports and the large-scale, vigorous, and serious inspection of hundreds of inspection teams, so that the movement can proceed to the final victory and wash away the poisons of the old society. We have such determination, and we also have such confidence and strength.

    京市协商委员会和市人民政府委员会
    在春节前夕举行扩大联席会议
    讨论进一步展开反贪污反行贿的斗争
    【新华社二十八日讯】北京市第三届各界人民代表会议协商委员会和市人民政府委员会在春节前夕（二十六日）举行扩大联席会议。讨论进一步开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动和在工商界展开反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗骗国家资财、偷工减料和反对盗窃国家经济情报的运动。
    会议首先听取北京市节约检查委员会主任刘仁报告运动进展的情况。刘仁根据具体的数字分析政府机关、企业、工矿、学校和人民团体运动的全貌之后说：“从已发现的贪污案中。可以看出以下主要的特点：贪污分子不仅有很大一部分是留用人员，并且百分之八十以上与工商界有关，其中有的本身就是资本家，有的是资本家的代理人。这个特点说明着一个情况：三年来，资产阶级是怎样猖狂地向我们革命队伍进攻，旧社会所遗留下来的污毒是怎样严重地在侵蚀着我们的国家机器。”他说：“经过近一个月来的努力，机关、团体、工矿、学校的运动已经展开了，群众已经发动起来了，许多小贪污和占小便宜的人大致都坦白交代了。但是仍然有不少严重的贪污分子拒不坦白或不彻底坦白，对于这些大贪污犯，除某些已经被逮捕法办外，各单位现在正集中力量进行围剿，运动也更加走向深入了。”刘仁接着报告工商界反行贿、反偷税、反盗骗国家资财运动的情况，他说：“现在收到的坦白和检举材料已达十一万件，牵涉的工商业在三万户以上，约占全市工商业户百分之六十以上。其中以行贿来勾结国家机关工作人员盗骗国家资财、走私偷税使国家受损失在一亿元以上的有一百二十二户。据粗略的统计，国家损失已达一千零九十八亿元以上。人民政府为了使那些损害过国家、损害过人民利益的资本家有所觉悟，给他们以悔过自新的机会，曾一再推迟检查日期。可是直到现在，还有不少人不坦白，或不彻底坦白，甚至抗拒与破坏运动。对于这些人，被逮捕法办的奸商刘元敬便是他们的榜样。我们将根据中央的指示，坚决地、毫不动摇地把运动搞到彻底为止，不管时间多久，不搞彻底决不罢休。任何人企图侥幸漏网，是绝不可能的事。”
    会议随又听取了北京高等学校节约检查委员会副主任李乐光、北京市工商业联合会主任委员傅华亭、北京市人民政府公安局副局长冯基平的三个报告。
    李乐光报告北京高等学校开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的情况。他说：“开始，许多教育机关的领导者存在着不正确的认识，以为自己‘两袖清风’，‘无污可贪，无费可浪，无官可僚’。但是群众发动起来，运动初步开展后，严重的贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象被揭发出来，大家这才大吃一惊，原来学校也并不例外。这才开始正视运动，开始检讨、批评与自我批评，才开始真正发扬民主。现在高等学校的运动正在展开中。”
    傅华亭报告北京市工商界反行贿、反偷税、反盗骗国家资财运动的情况，他说：“这次宣传动员工作比任何一次都做得普遍和深入，可以说是家喻户晓了。但是现在运动的深度还很不够，发展也极不平衡。特别是一些问题较多较大的行业和商户还没有认真地坦白交代。”最后，他表示要利用春节暂停检查十天的机会，再深入进行动员，争取更多的不法工商业者坦白交代、悔过自新。
    冯基平报告市公安部门开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的情况。他着重介绍了这次组织工作组直接深入到全市二百五十三个派出所管界内，采取当时派出所人员一律回避的方针发动群众检举的经验。他说：“这次工作组下去是很适时的。正当机关运动达到高潮，对不法工商业者正在展开大规模检查的时候，工作组下去了，互相配合、互相呼应，形成了对贪污行贿分子夹击的形势。”
    报告后，大会讨论。发言的有汤用彤、浦洁修、王之相、凌其峻、郑芸、徐楚波、张鸿舜、李国瑞、舒舍予（老舍）、曹宪波、陈铭德、苏民、朱长江等市协商委员会委员及市人民政府委员。发言者都结合自己在运动中的体验，说明开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的必要性和教育意义的伟大。舒舍予说：“运动对我个人的教育意义太大了。我本来觉得自己根本没有官僚主义，可以和三轮车工人在一起喝酒吃饭，可是我们机关的会计是怎样赚钱的，我却不管。这次运动使我明白过来了，我也有官僚主义，所谓‘索身自好’只是自己洁身，却不能使别人不贪污。”张鸿舜、李国瑞、曹宪波等在发言中，代表各工矿企业职工主张严办胆敢阻挠和破坏运动的不法工商业者。
    最后，由北京市各界人民代表会议协商委员会主席、北京市人民政府市长彭真作总结。彭真说：近一个月来的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动，已经获得了很大的成绩。但是却还十分不彻底，特别是在工商界中的反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗骗国家资财和偷工减料及反对盗窃经济情报的斗争还不过是才有一个良好的开始，距离彻底完成任务还很远。切不可有丝毫自满松懈。对于机关、工厂、团体、学校这个时期运动的开展，彭真指出主要的原因是贯彻了首长负责带头检讨的方针，充分发扬了民主。许多运动开展得较好的单位，各种大小问题都暴露无遗，并获得了适当解决，因此，工作人员的工作积极性空前高涨，气象焕然一新，反之，则工作仍无改进。今后还要进一步在上下之间、各部门之间、各领导同志相互之间、展开批评和自我批评，把一切问题谈清，消除一切隔阂，在思想完全一致的基础上加强团结，并切实改进我们的工作，密切政府和人民之间的关系。对于工商界这个时期的运动，彭真认为广大工人、店员和市工商业联合会的一部分负责人是作了积极努力的，同时也取得了一定的成绩，但是现在真正自动坦白的，多半还是中小的不法工商业户，问题大的，多半坦白的不彻底、所谓坦白多半是避重就轻、企图蒙混过去。最后的事实会证明他们只自作孽。彭真说：民族资产阶级有积极的一面，也有消极的一面；有和人民利益相一致的地方，也有和人民利益相违背的地方；工商界中有一部分不法分子的所作所为，完全证明了他们是国家和人民的盗贼。他们肆无忌惮地在侵吞、盗窃和骗取国家的资财，并用一切方法腐化国家的工作人员。我们决不能允许这种现象再继续下去了。为了保护我们的祖国，为了保护全体人民的利益，同时也为了保护守法的工商业者的正当经营，我们必须继续坚决打击那些不法的工商业者，不准他们侵害人民利益，盗窃国家资财；只准他们走新民主主义的道路，不准走反新民主主义的道路，只准守法，不准违法。最后他说：我们的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动和工商界的反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗骗国家资财和偷工减料及反对盗窃国家经济情报的运动，都必须继续采用自动坦白检讨，特别是广大群众检举和数以百计的检查组的大规模的雷厉风行的认真的检查，使运动进行到最后的胜利，把旧社会的污毒洗干净。我们有这样的决心，也有这样的信心和力量。
