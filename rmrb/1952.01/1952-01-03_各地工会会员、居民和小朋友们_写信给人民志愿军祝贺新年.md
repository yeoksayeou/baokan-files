Trade Union Members, Residents, and Children Across the Country Write Letters to the People's Volunteer Army to Celebrate the New Year

[This Newspaper Reported] On New Year's Day 1952, all members of the Construction and Plastering Trade Union in Tongren County, Guizhou Province, the Dali Soap Factory in Duyun, the wharf committees of the China Transportation Trade Union in Chongqing, the Gejiu Minsheng Timber and Pine Joint Venture in Yunnan Province, the Quanzhou Hospital Trade Union in Fujian Province, and all residents of the Wangyemiao Section 6 in Chongqing, sent telegrams to the Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association for forwarding to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to celebrate the New Year. They expressed their firm response to Chairman Mao's call to continue strengthening the Resist-America Aid-Korea work, increasing production, and practicing thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Their telegrams stated: "Dear Comrades, Commanders, and Fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: For the safety of the people of the motherland, for the lasting peace of the Far East and the world, you are fighting hard against the enemy in the freezing cold alongside the Korean People's Army. In the fourteen months since you went abroad to fight, you have eliminated 490,000 invading troops, including 210,000 American troops. How happy we were when we heard this news of victory! Thanks to the great victories you and the Korean People's Army have achieved, the safety of our motherland has been effectively guaranteed, the patriotic movement of the people across the country has been promoted, and the enemy has been forced to hold armistice negotiations with us. Your righteous actions are a concentrated expression of the Chinese people's patriotism and internationalism, and are the supreme glory of the people of the motherland." Some telegrams stated that in the past year, under the leadership of the wise leader Chairman Mao, the people of the country launched three large-scale movements: Resist-America Aid-Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and achieved brilliant victories. The people are living a peaceful and happy life. These achievements should be attributed to you—the meritorious comrades of the People's Volunteer Army. Without your heroic struggle against the enemy, the peace and security of the motherland would not be guaranteed, and various construction works could not be carried out. Therefore, you are the protectors of the people, the "most beloved people" among the people. In their telegrams, they unanimously expressed to the Volunteer Army that in 1952, they will resolutely take practical actions to ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's call: increase production, practice thrift, and give preferential treatment to military families to support the Resist-America Aid-Korea struggle, defeat American imperialist aggression, and strive to defend the lasting peace of the Far East and the world.

[This Newspaper Reported] On the eve of New Year's Day, the children of the Dashuiche Primary School in the Second District of Beijing wrote letters to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front to celebrate the New Year. In these letters, they fully expressed the kind concern and love of the children of the motherland for the Volunteer Army, and unanimously expressed unparalleled hatred and anger towards the American aggressors. In many letters, the children reported on the construction of the motherland and their hard work in studying. Some children also reported various examples of the people of the motherland enthusiastically supporting the Volunteer Army in the Resist-America Aid-Korea campaign.

Jiang Zhiguang wrote in his letter: "Dear Volunteer Army Uncles: In order to defend the security of the motherland and strive for lasting world peace, you crossed the Yalu River and heroically attacked the American aggressors. This great and just action will always be praised and supported by the people of the motherland and all peace-loving people in the world!"

Hong Huizhen wrote in her letter: "We are having a happy New Year in the motherland, wearing new clothes, playing with toys, and eating sweets, but the uncles are fighting the American devils on the front in the freezing cold! So in the happy New Year, I immediately thought that this is the happiness that the Volunteer Army uncles gave us, and we must never forget the uncles for a moment!"

Shan Xiuyuan also wrote: "We can get such a happy life entirely because the uncles are fighting hard in the front! I really can't say a word that can comfort the uncles, I can only thank the uncles from the bottom of my heart! And use hard study to step up the promotion of the Resist-America Aid-Korea work to thank you. Regarding the families of the uncles, the People's Government and the local people will be able to take care of and help, please rest assured, uncles!"

Li Jingfang wrote in her letter about her savings plan: "Uncles are bravely killing the enemy in the front, and the worker and peasant uncles in the rear are actively producing, making more guns and artillery, and growing more grain to support you! We pupils are not lagging behind either, and have decided not to eat snacks, save the money, and make consolation bags and buy notebooks to send to the uncles!"

Li Taichang wrote in his letter: "Dear Volunteer Army Uncles, your heroic stories have spread to every corner of the motherland and around the world. You are the most beloved people in the hearts of the people of the motherland! You are also the glorious soldiers of the people of the world!"

In all the children's letters, they unanimously hoped that the People's Volunteer Army would fight more beautiful battles and kill more American devils! Everyone should strive for the glorious title of combat hero.
