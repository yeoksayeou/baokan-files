Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 8th: Our front-line reporter reports: On the afternoon of December 8, 1951, a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army shot down a B-26 bomber belonging to the 3rd Bombardment Group, 3rd Wing of the US Air Force in a certain area of northern Korea. The pilot of the plane, Steiner (military number: A·0758878), who was captured after parachuting, carried five double-sided, finely printed silk maps. It is worth noting that among these five maps, three are maps of our country: two maps, one side being Beijing and the other being Lushun, and one side being Rehe and the other being Shenyang; in addition, there is a map of Vladivostok and Kaesong, and a map of Nagasaki and Kagoshima in Japan. These are all 1:1,000,000 scale aviation military maps.

According to pilot Steiner, he had flown 25 times since September to fight in Korea, all at night, attacking the transport lines of the Korean and Chinese forces; this was the only time he flew during the day. As for where he was going and what "mission" he was carrying out, he said he didn't know; only a navigating US Air Force captain knew, but he was killed by our anti-aircraft fire.

The fact that a US bomber carrying maps of our capital Beijing and Lushun, Shenyang, and Rehe, flew over northern Korea toward a secretly undisclosed destination, proves once again that the US aggressors are deliberately persisting in and expanding the war of aggression.

    美国蓄意扩大侵略战争的又一罪证
    美轰炸机带有北京沈阳等地军用航空地图
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】本社前线记者报道：中国人民志愿军某高射炮部队于一九五一年十二月八日下午，在朝鲜北部某地击落美国空军第三轰炸机大队第三联队B二六型轰炸机一架。跳伞后被俘的该机驾驶员斯坦纳（军号：A·零七五八八七八）身上带有五张两面精印的绢质地图。值得注意的是这五张地图中，有我国的地图三张：一面是北京一面是旅顺的地图两张，一面是热河一面是沈阳的一张；另外是海参崴和开城的一张，日本的长崎和鹿儿岛的一张。这都是一百万分之一的航空军事地图。
    据驾驶员斯坦纳供说，他自九月份到朝鲜作战，共飞行过二十五次，都是在夜间袭击朝中部队的运输线；唯独此次是白天飞行。到什么地方去，执行什么“任务”，他说都不知道，只有一个领航的美国空军上尉知道，但已被我高射炮火打死了。
    美国轰炸机带着我国首都北京和旅顺、沈阳、热河的地图、经朝鲜北部上空飞向一个密而不宣的目的地去，这就再次证明美国侵略者蓄意坚持并扩大侵略战争。
