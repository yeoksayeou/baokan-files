    The Workers of Beijing Gui Xiang Cun Win a Victory

    Editor: Before liberation, the Gui Xiang Cun store in the Second District of Beijing was run by the traitor Zhou Dawen. Zhou Dawen owned one-half of the total capital. The current manager of Gui Xiang Cun, Lei Shaoyu, and two other shareholders own the other two shares together. After the liberation of Beijing, the Public Enemy Property Management Bureau sent Wei Zeyi to Gui Xiang Cun to handle the traitor's shares. Wei Zeyi did not investigate with the workers, but dealt with the capitalists alone. The workers of Gui Xiang Cun clearly knew that the traitor's property accounted for two shares, but the Property Management Bureau changed it to one share. At that time, the workers had concerns and did not dare to report it. The matter was then left unresolved.

    When the campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began this time, the workers of Gui Xiang Cun remembered this matter. But some people said, "Don't report it, what will happen if we lose our jobs?" Trade union cadre Ma Changlin was also considering, he thought, "Is the people's property more important? Or not offending people?" The education that the Party and the trade union had given him for more than two years strengthened his confidence. With the support of Yan Zhishan and others, he was encouraged to fight. So, he went to the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and the Second District Office to report the matter. At this time, Lei Shaoyu, the manager of Gui Xiang Cun, had to confess to embezzling one-quarter of the shares. This time, the workers of Gui Xiang Cun resolutely fought against the capitalists and won a great victory, and the traitor's property finally returned to the people.

    北京桂香村工人打了一个胜仗
    编辑同志：北京市第二区桂香村商号，解放以前，是汉奸周大文经营的。全部资本，周大文占二分之一。现在的桂香村经理雷绍宇和其他两个股东合占两股。北京解放后，公逆产清管局派魏泽怡到桂香村清理逆产股份。魏泽怡不向工人调查，就单独地和资本家处理了。桂香村的工人们明明知道逆产占两股，但经清管局改成一股了。当时工人有顾虑，也没敢检举。这件事就被放下了。
    在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，桂香村的工人想起了这件事。但有的人说：“快别报了，失业怎么办呢？”工会干部马长林也在考虑，他想：“是人民财产要紧呢？还是不得罪人呢？”两年多以来党和工会对他的教育，坚定了他的信心，加以阎志山等人的支持，又鼓舞了他的斗争勇气，于是，他就到北京市总工会和第二区办事处检举了这件事。这时，桂香村经理雷绍宇也不得不坦白所侵吞的四分之一股份。这次桂香村的工人坚决和资方作斗争，打了一个大胜仗，逆产终于回到人民手里来了。    卢哲
