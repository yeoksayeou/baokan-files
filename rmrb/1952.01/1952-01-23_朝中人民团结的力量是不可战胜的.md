The Strength of the People's Unity Between Korea and China is Invincible
Head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, Hong Chunzhe
Great Chinese brothers and sisters! Comrades! Friends!

Under the deep concern of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the great Chairman Mao Zedong, our Korean People's Delegation to China, composed of representatives from all walks of life in Korea and the Korean People's Army, is honored to visit the great People's Republic of China—a brotherly nation of 475 million people—fighting for peace and security in the Far East and for the freedom and independence of both Korea and China.

On behalf of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude and condolences to the brotherly Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and their leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, for their immense armed, material, and spiritual assistance to the Korean people.

We are visiting China at a time when the Chinese people are engaged in a great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, which has great significance. The vigorous Three-Anti Movement launched by 475 million Chinese brothers is a powerful guarantee for the victory of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea struggle, China's industrialization, and the consolidation of national defense. Therefore, it encourages us, the Korean people, even more.

During this visit, our delegation will introduce the heroic resistance of the Korean military and civilians and the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the great Chinese people, in order to further consolidate the militant unity between the people of Korea and China. At the same time, we will observe the increase in production to support the front in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement and the Three-Anti Movement, as well as the achievements in political, economic, and cultural construction, so that we can convey what we have learned to the Korean people upon our return, thereby enhancing the Korean people's confidence in victory and fighting spirit a hundredfold.

In June 1950, the American imperialists launched a war of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Korean people and their armed forces—the Korean People's Army—waged a resolute struggle against the armed interventionists in order to defend their motherland. The American-Li bandits suffered a disastrous defeat, surrounded by our army on three sides in a narrow area of Gyeongsangnam-do. The frenzied enemy then disregarded everything, mobilizing a huge army, navy, and troops from a group of vassal states to expand the war of aggression.

Due to the enemy's superiority in numbers and technology, the Korean People's Army had to temporarily retreat, and many areas in the northern half of the country were temporarily occupied by the enemy.

American planes indiscriminately bombed our country, turning major cities into scorched earth and turning our country, from fishing villages along the southern coast to remote rural areas in the northern border area, into ruins. According to incomplete statistics as of January 1951, the enemy had destroyed more than 610,000 factories, enterprises, schools, hospitals, and residences in our country.

The number of Korean people massacred by the American-Li bandit gangs was more than 15,000 in Pyongyang alone, more than 3,000 in Gangseo County, South Pyongan Province, more than 43,000 in Seoul and its suburbs, more than 6,000 in Haeju, more than 26,000 in Ongjin County, more than 22,000 in Sincheon County, and more than 100,000 in Hwanghae Province.

When the American aggressors retreated from Pyongyang, they threatened "to use atomic bombs" to force innocent citizens to leave the urban area. When a large group of people entered the Daedong River, they were strafed with machine guns and planes. A total of more than 4,000 Korean people were killed or injured by the strafing, and the Daedong River was instantly stained red with blood. In Seoul, the American aggressors arrested imprisoned patriots—such as workers from the Gyeongseong Electric Company in Dongdaemun—alive, stuffed them into straw bags, threw them into the heart of the Han River, and strafed them with machine guns, killing them all. The beasts killed thousands upon thousands of Korean people by such brutal means.

In early October 1950, after the US military forcibly occupied Jiahe Township, Paju County, Gyeonggi Province, they immediately arrested 135 residents of the area, forced them to kneel on the road, and then drove tanks over them alive.

The US military even cut off the lips and tongues of six children who sang "In Praise of General Kim Il-sung" and brutally killed them.

In early 1950, in Unyin Township, Songmok County, Hwanghae Province, the enemy army, under the pretext of searching for the families of Labor Party members, massacred more than 200 women and children, including 70 children aged four to eight. The US military used grass ropes to tie them together in a string and bury them alive in the woods of Unyin Township.

In Myeondam-ri, Ganghyeon Township, Yangyang County, Gangwon Province, an innocent farmer, Yu Hee-doo, was tied to a pine tree and sawn into three sections from the head. In Yuldong, Sincheon County, Hwanghae Province, the US military locked 70 children under the age of ten in a gunpowder warehouse without giving them a drop of water. These innocent children also starved or froze to death. The wife of Kim Gye-seon, a patriot from Gacheon County, had her belly cut open by US soldiers with bayonets, and the baby in her belly was taken out and fed to dogs. …

The enemy's barbarous atrocities are endless. In order to kill a large number of Korean people, the American aggressors spread smallpox in various parts of North Korea that they temporarily occupied, and even used bacteriological weapons on the Korean battlefield.

When the fate of our country was at its most dangerous, the Chinese people raised the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, extended a helping hand to us, and sent their outstanding sons and daughters—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—to directly participate in the Korean War. When the brotherly comrades-in-arms—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—stepped into Korean territory, the grateful cheers of the Korean people welcoming them shook the heavens and the earth. The armed assistance of the Chinese people to the Korean people is the most precious manifestation of fraternal unity among the people of the democratic camp. The Korean and Chinese people have common interests and common hopes for peace and the prosperity of their motherlands, and jointly bear the important mission of fighting against the common enemy who attempts to conquer Korea and invade China. We know that the friendly relations between the people of Korea and China have a long history. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean and Chinese people shed blood and fought side by side in the past struggle to defeat the common enemy, Japanese imperialism. The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Korean battlefield is a model of friendship, unity, and mutual assistance between democratic countries, and a concrete manifestation of the great internationalism of the Chinese people. The participation of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Korean battlefield fundamentally changed the balance of power between the enemy and us and enhanced the confidence of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army in victory. In the past year of war, the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have repelled the frenzied invasion of the American interventionists armed to the teeth and the armed interventionists of nineteen countries, which proves that no matter how desperately the enemy struggles, it is impossible to conquer the fighting power of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The Korean People's Army, in the great Fatherland Liberation War for the freedom, independence, and honor of the motherland, demonstrated great heroism and produced a large number of model units, combat heroes, and model combatants. Nearly 300 officers and soldiers have been awarded the title of Hero, and more than 260,000 officers and soldiers have been awarded the National Flag Medal, the Freedom and Independence Medal, the Yi Sun-sin Medal, the Soldier's Honor Medal, and the Military Merit Medal. In the fierce battles to eliminate the American aggressors and the Li Seung-man bandits, the Korean People's Army fully demonstrated its firm determination to eliminate the enemy, defend the motherland, and defend the honor of the people. Our People's Army has the Republic heroes such as Kim Chang-jie, Kim Ok-geun, and Park Seok-bong, the Korean "Matrosov" who used their bodies to block the enemy's gun muzzles and heavy machine-gun nests, ensuring the victory of the battle. In the battle of the 602.6 Highland in the Sinxi area on December 5, 1950, the enemy stubbornly resisted with strong fortifications in order to prevent our army from advancing. Squad leader Kim Chang-jie received the combat mission of "eliminating the enemy's firepower point on the 602.6 Highland" and led his troops to approach within 50 meters of the enemy's position. He immediately climbed onto the enemy's position alone and blocked the enemy's 60mm artillery fire hole with his body. The enemy's firepower point was silenced, and our army was able to continue to advance victoriously.

The heroic deeds of Squad Leader Kim Chang-jie inspired Squad Leader Kim Ok-geun to block the enemy's firing machine-gun fire hole with his body, rescuing his beloved comrades and ensuring the victory of the battle.

Comrade Li Xuewen, a double hero of the Republic, who accepted the reconnaissance mission and actively operated behind enemy lines for more than six months, risked his life and ran into the enemy's sleeping quarters, hiding in a cabinet, while carrying out reconnaissance missions near the enemy command. In the cabinet, he carefully listened to all the secrets of the enemy's conversation. Later, he returned to the troops safely and victoriously.

Not only that, but once Comrade Li Xuewen found out about the enemy's newly transferred artillery battalion, he immediately contacted the troops and led 30 combatants to raid the enemy artillery team. In the battle against the enemy, which was absolutely superior in number, they created a brilliant battle record of eliminating more than 370 enemies and capturing 12 105mm cannons.

Comrade Kim Gun-ok, a naval hero of the Republic, fought bravely against two enemy cruisers and one destroyer with a torpedo boat and achieved amazing results. Comrade Kim Gun-ok boldly and carefully directed the soldiers to steer the torpedo boat to a short distance of only 50 meters from the enemy cruiser while the enemy ships had not yet concentrated their firepower, and sank an enemy cruiser with a single torpedo.

In addition, there are hundreds of combat heroes in the Korean People's Army, such as Comrades Kim Ki-woo, Li Dae-hoon, Zhao Xuan-gu, Li Dong-gyu, Zhang Jae-geun, Chen Dou-ping, Cui Zheng-yun, Shi Qi-xi, Jiang Hu-ying, Hong Zhao-hee, and Kim Yeo-hong, who have made outstanding achievements in battle.

These heroic deeds are not only reflected in the individual personnel of our People's Army, but also in many troop units.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's commanders and fighters, who fought bravely side by side with the Korean People's Army, have displayed revolutionary heroism and fortitude since the first day of their participation in the Korean War. Ma Chong-kui, the platoon leader of the Volunteer Army, who won the title of Flying Tiger Mountain Combat Hero, led a platoon of troops to fight the enemy for five days and nights. Until the last three people were left, they continued to repel the enemy's several counterattacks, killing and wounding a large number of enemies, completely defeating the enemy's attack, and holding the high ground, making great contributions.

Yang Gensi, the heroic company commander of the Volunteer Army, led a platoon to defend its position, killing and wounding more than a thousand enemies, and finally embraced explosives and perished together with a group of enemies.

The Second Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army fought bravely against enemies who were dozens of times larger than themselves, under the cover of planes and tanks, and finally defended Jiwoong Mountain north of Jinhua for seventeen days and nights, killing and wounding more than a thousand enemies. The entire company was awarded the glorious title of "Jiwoong Mountain Blocking Battle Hero Company."

Li Tailin, a combat hero of the Volunteer Army, repelled the attacks of enemies dozens of times larger than our army in a defensive battle that lasted for 18 consecutive days and nights, and defended his position. In the last two days, he repelled the enemy's seven assaults alone with grenades, earning the glorious title of Grenade Throwing Hero.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has won great victories and established creative achievements in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea War.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army not only demonstrated heroic dedication on the front line, but also respected and cared for the Korean people in the rear of the war as if they were their own people. The Volunteer Army comrades launched a movement to save military food to relieve the disaster victims in the Korean war zone, and actively helped the people in the rear with spring plowing, weeding, and autumn harvest.

The Korean people were very moved by this friendly spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. And our Korean people also warmly support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in combat.

The people in the rear of Korea boil water to comfort the Volunteer Army soldiers who went to the front. If the Volunteer Army wants to camp, they are willing to vacate their houses for the comrades to live in. The residents actively helped the Volunteer Army comrades wash their clothes, and quietly sewed and mended their clothes and shoes while the Volunteer Army comrades were fast asleep. In order to ensure the timely transportation of military supplies, the people in the rear helped the Volunteer Army fight, regardless of gunfire and bullets, and also led them, and transferred the wounded for them.

In every village where the Volunteer Army comrades were stationed, the people scrambled to make big cakes from the newly harvested grain and send them to the Volunteer Army comrades from dozens of miles away.

For the final victory of the great Fatherland Liberation War, we Korean people will do everything possible to overcome all difficulties and do a better job in supporting the front.

The struggle of the Korean people is encouraged by the great Chinese people's Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement.

The great Chinese people's Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement is a guarantee for the Korean people to win victory in the struggle to defend the freedom, independence, and honor of their motherland. And I believe that this movement will be carried out solemnly until the American aggressors are completely eliminated from the territory of our motherland.

The immortal kindness of our great neighbor, the Chinese people, will make our Korean people never forget it for generations to come.

The heroic struggle of the people of Korea and China will make brilliant and immortal great achievements in the cause of world peace and security.

We representatives will convey to the Chinese people the Korean people's determination to defend every inch of their motherland and strengthen their unity and friendship with the heroic Chinese people in order to completely eliminate the enemy in our motherland during the period of serious military and political situation, and wish the heroic Chinese people greater combat victories.

The iron-like fighting unity of the people of Korea and China, who are warmly supported by the peace-loving people of the world headed by the great Soviet people, is a powerful force that no aggressive force can ever conquer.

If the American imperialists do not abandon their plan to invade our country and break the ongoing armistice negotiations, then, for the sake of their own freedom and independence, the people of Korea and China, standing at the forefront of safeguarding world peace and security, will continue to strike the enemy and eliminate the invaders on our land.

Victory belongs to the people of Korea and China who are fighting for the independence, freedom, and honor of their motherland, and for the cause of peace and justice for mankind.

Please accept the friendly gratitude of the Korean people to the heroic Chinese people under the leadership of the wise Chairman Mao Zedong!

Long live the iron-like unity and friendship between the people of Korea and China!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

Long live General Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people!

Long live Marshal Stalin, the leader of the working people of the world, the liberator of our nation, and our close friend!

    朝中人民团结的力量是不可战胜的
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团长　洪淳哲
    伟大的中国兄弟姊妹们！战友们！朋友们！
    在中国共产党和中华人民共和国中央人民政府和伟大的毛泽东主席的深切关怀下，我们由朝鲜各阶层人民与朝鲜人民军的代表组成的朝鲜人民访华代表团，能得到访问为远东和平与安全和朝中两国自由独立而战的伟大的中华人民共和国——四亿七千五百万人民的兄弟国家，是十分荣幸的事。
    我代表朝鲜人民与朝鲜人民军，谨向对朝鲜人民予以武装及物资与精神上莫大援助的兄弟的中国人民和中国共产党与其领袖毛泽东主席表示衷心的感谢和慰问。
    中国人民目前正进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争，我们在这时候来访问中国，实有巨大的意义。四亿七千五百万中国弟兄们轰轰烈烈地展开的三反运动是抗美援朝斗争的胜利、中国的工业化和巩固国防的有力的保证。因此更加鼓舞着我们朝鲜人民。　我们代表团在自己这次工作当中，将把我们朝鲜军民的英雄抗战的情形和英雄的中国人民志愿军的战斗事迹介绍给伟大的中国人民，以便更进一步地巩固朝中两国人民的战斗团结。同时将参观中国人民在抗美援朝运动和三反运动中增加生产、支援前线的情形和政治、经济、文化建设的成就，以便回国把参观所得传达给我们朝鲜人民，借此把朝鲜人民的必胜信心和斗志更加百倍地提高。
    美帝国主义者于一九五○年六月间，发动了侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战争。朝鲜人民及其武装力量——朝鲜人民军，为了保卫自己的祖国，向武装干涉者作了坚决的斗争。美李匪军遭到惨败，被我军三面包围于庆尚南道狭窄的地区内。疯狂的敌人这时就不顾一切，动员了庞大的陆海军和一批仆从国家的军队，扩大进行侵略战争。
    由于敌人在数量和技术上占优势，大举进犯，朝鲜人民军不得不暂时后撤，同时，北半部许多地区也不得不暂时沦陷于敌手。
    美国飞机滥施轰炸，将我国主要城市化为焦土，并把我国从沿南海岸的渔村起到北部国境地带的偏僻的农村，变成废墟。据截至一九五一年一月的不完全统计，敌人已破坏我国六十一万栋以上的工厂、企业、学校、医院和住宅。
    被美李匪帮屠杀了的朝鲜人民，仅在平壤一地就有一万五千余名，在平安南道江西郡有三千余人，在汉城及其市郊区有四万三千余名，在海州有六千余名，在瓮津郡有二万六千余名，在信川郡有二万二千余名，在黄海道有十万余名。
    美国侵略者从平壤溃退时，以“将使用原子弹”进行恫吓，逼迫无辜市民离开市区。待大群人民进入大同江边时，即以机枪并以飞机扫射。朝鲜人民被扫射死伤共达四千余名，大同江顿时为鲜血染红。在汉城，美国侵略者把被囚禁的爱国者——如东大门的京城电气公司工人，逮捕后活活的装在草袋里，投入汉江江心，并加以机枪扫射，尽数杀死。野兽们就是以这样残暴的手段来杀害了千千万万的朝鲜人民。
    一九五○年十月初，美军强占京畿道坡州郡交河面后，立即逮捕了该地居民一百三十五名，逼使他们跪在大道上，再开动坦克活活地把他们轧死。
    美军甚至对歌唱“歌颂金日成将军”的六名儿童，也割去嘴唇，舌头，加以惨杀。
    一九五○年初，在黄海道松木郡云阴面，敌军藉口搜捕劳动党党员家属，屠杀了二百余名妇女和儿童，其中有四岁到八岁的儿童七十名。美军使用草绳把他们绑成一串，活埋在云阴面的树林里。
    在江原道襄阳郡降岘面面潭里，无辜农民俞熙斗被绑在松树上，用锯从头部锯开三段。在黄海道信川郡栗洞，美军把不满十岁的儿童七十名，关入火药仓库，连一口水都不给喝。这些无辜的儿童也活活的饿死或冻死了。价川郡爱国人士金桂善的妻子，被美军用刺刀把肚子割开后，把肚子里的小孩拿出来喂狗。……
    敌人的野蛮暴行，是说不完的。美国侵略者为了大量杀害朝鲜人民，曾在他们暂时侵占的北朝鲜各地传布了天花，甚至在朝鲜战场上使用了细菌武器。
    当我们祖国的命运处在最危险的时候，中国人民举起抗美援朝的旗帜，向我们伸出了救援之手，派遣自己的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军直接参加朝鲜战争。当弟兄般的战友——中国人民志愿军踏进朝鲜疆土时，朝鲜人民欢迎他们的感激的欢呼震撼了天地。中国人民给朝鲜人民的武装援助，乃是民主阵营里的人民的最珍贵的兄弟团结的表现。朝鲜人民与中国人民对于和平与祖国隆盛，有着共同的利害关系和共同希望，共同担负着对妄图征服朝鲜与侵略中国的共同敌人作战的重大使命。我们知道：朝、中两国人民的友谊关系已有了悠久的历史。朝鲜人民与中国人民的优秀儿女在过去击溃共同敌人日本帝国主义者的斗争中曾经并肩流血奋斗。中国人民志愿军参加了朝鲜战场，这是民主国家之间的友谊团结与相互协助的模范典型，是中国人民的伟大的国际主义的具体表现。英勇的中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜战场，使敌我力量对比上起了根本的变化，并提高了朝鲜人民与朝鲜人民军的胜利信心。过去一年来的战争过程中，英勇的朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军击退了武装到牙齿的美国干涉者及十九个国家的武装干涉者的疯狂进犯，这证明了敌人如何垂死挣扎也不可能征服朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的战斗力量。朝鲜人民军，在为祖国的自由、独立和荣誉的伟大祖国解放战争中，表现了伟大的英雄气概，涌现了大批的模范部队，战斗英雄和模范战斗员。计荣获英雄称号的官兵将近有三百名，荣获国旗勋章、自由独立勋章、李舜臣勋章、战士荣誉勋章和军功奖章的官兵有二十六万余名之多。在消灭美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮的残酷战斗中，朝鲜人民军充分表现了消灭敌人捍卫祖国和人民的荣誉的坚强的决心。我们人民军里有以自己的肉体堵塞敌人的炮口和重机枪枪眼、保证了战斗胜利的朝鲜的“马特洛索夫”金昌杰、金玉根、朴石奉等共和国英雄。一九五○年十二月五日在新溪地区六○二·六高地战斗中，敌军为了阻止我军前进，凭借坚固的堡垒工事顽抗。小队长金昌杰同志接受了“消灭六○二·六高地敌军火力点”的战斗任务，率领着自己的部队，接近到敌阵地五○米之地点，他即时单身爬上敌阵地，以自己的肉体，堵塞了敌人的六○糎炮火口，敌人的火力点就沉默了，我军得以继续胜利前进。
    金昌杰小队长的英雄事迹，激发了分队长金玉根同志，以自己的肉体塞住敌人的发射重机枪火力的枪眼，救出了可爱的战友们，保证了战斗的胜利。
    接受了侦察任务在敌后积极活动了六个多月的共和国双重英雄，李学文同志，在敌军指挥部近处执行侦察任务时，冒着危险，跑到敌人住宿的房间里，匿藏在柜里。他在柜里细心侦听敌人谈话的一切机密。以后他胜利地安全回到部队。
    不仅如此，李学文同志有一次在探悉敌军新调来一个炮兵大队的情况后，便立即与部队取得联络，并且带着三十名的战斗员，奇袭敌军炮队。他们在与数量上占绝对优势的敌人作战中，创造了歼敌三百七十余名，缴获一○五公厘炮十二门的辉煌战例。
    共和国海军英雄金君钰同志，以一艘鱼雷艇同敌两艘巡洋舰和一艘驱逐舰奋战，获得了惊人的战果。金君钰同志胆大心细地指挥着战士，趁着敌舰还没集中发挥火力射击时，就把鱼雷艇开到距敌巡洋舰只有五十公尺的短距离，以单发鱼雷击沉敌巡洋舰一艘。
    除此而外在朝鲜人民军部队里还有战功卓著的金基禹、李大勋、赵玄九、李东奎、张在根、陈斗平、崔正云、石七熙、姜虎英、洪朝熙、金如弘同志等数百名的战斗英雄。
    这些英雄事迹，不仅表现在我人民军队的个别人员，而且也表现在许多部队单位。
    和朝鲜人民军并肩英勇战斗的中国人民志愿军全体指战员们，自从参加朝鲜战争的头一天起，即发挥了革命英雄主义精神与刚毅性。荣膺飞虎山战斗英雄的志愿军马重奎排长，率领一个排的兵力，与敌奋战五昼夜，直到最后剩下三个人，依然继续打退敌人的数次的反击，杀伤大量的敌人，完全打败了敌人的攻击，坚守住高地，立下了伟大的功勋。
    志愿军英雄连长杨根思同志率领一个排坚守阵地，毙伤敌人千余名，最后抱了炸药，与一群敌人同归于尽。
    志愿军某部第二连与数十倍于己的在飞机、坦克的掩护下疯狂进犯之敌，奋战十七昼夜，终于守住了金化以北的鸡雄山，毙伤敌人千余名，全连荣膺了“鸡雄山阻击战英雄连”的光荣称号。
    志愿军战斗英雄李泰林同志在连续十八昼夜的防御战中，击退了比我军多几十倍的敌人的进攻，守住了自己的阵地。他在最后两天，单独用手榴弹打退了敌人的七次冲锋，得到了投弹英雄的光荣称号。
    中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝作战中，已获得了伟大的胜利，建立了创造性的功绩。
    中国人民志愿军不仅在前线上发挥了英雄的献身精神，而且在作战的后方也像对自己祖国人民一样地尊敬和爱护着朝鲜人民。志愿军同志们曾发动节约军粮救济朝鲜战区灾民的运动，积极帮助后方人民春耕，除草和秋收。
    中国人民志愿军对朝鲜人民的这种友爱精神使我们朝鲜人民非常感动。而我们朝鲜人民也热情地支援中国人民志愿军作战。
    朝鲜后方的人民烧开水慰劳上前方的志愿军勇士。志愿军要宿营，他们都愿腾出房子给同志们住。居民们并积极帮助志愿军同志洗衣裳，趁着志愿军同志们在熟睡时，悄悄地给他们缝衣补鞋。后方人民为保障军需物资的及时运送，不顾枪林弹雨，帮助志愿军作战，还给他们带路，给他们转送伤员。
    志愿军同志们所驻的每个村庄，老百姓争先恐后地从数十里远的地方，用新收下的粮食作成大糕送给志愿军同志们吃。
    我们朝鲜人民为了伟大的祖国解放战争的最后胜利，将尽一切力量克服一切困难，把支援前线的工作做的更好。
    朝鲜人民的斗争，被伟大的中国人民的抗美援朝运动所鼓舞着。
    伟大的中国人民的抗美援朝运动，乃是朝鲜人民在为捍卫祖国的自由、独立和荣誉的斗争中取得胜利的保证。我并相信这运动将庄严地进行，直到把美国侵略者完全消灭在我们祖国疆土上为止。
    我们伟大的邻邦中国人民千秋不灭的恩情，将使我们朝鲜人民万代子孙永世不忘。
    朝、中两国人民的英雄斗争将在为全世界和平与安全的事业上立下灿烂不朽的伟大勋功。
    我们代表们，将朝鲜人民在处于严重的军事、政治形势的时期，坚守祖国的每一寸土地，加强与英勇的中国人民的团结友谊，以便把敌人彻底消灭在我祖国的决心，转达给中国人民，并祝英勇的中国人民得到更大的战斗胜利。
    受到以伟大的苏联人民为首的全世界爱好和平人民的热烈声援的朝、中两国人民钢铁般的战斗团结，乃是任何侵略势力永远不能征服的强大的力量。
    假使美帝国主义者不抛弃对我祖国的侵略计划，而破裂正在进行的停战谈判，那么，为了自己祖国的自由和独立，站在维护世界和平与安全的最前卫的朝、中两国人民将继续打击敌人，把侵略者消灭在我国的土地上。
    胜利属于为祖国的独立、自由和荣誉，为人类和平正义事业而奋斗的朝、中两国人民的方面。
    英明的毛泽东主席领导下的英勇的中国人民，请接受朝鲜人民充满着友谊的感谢吧！
    朝、中两国人民的钢铁般的团结友谊万岁！
    中国人民的伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    朝鲜人民的敬爱的领袖金日成将军万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的领袖、我们民族的解放者、亲密朋友——伟大的斯大林大元帅万岁！
