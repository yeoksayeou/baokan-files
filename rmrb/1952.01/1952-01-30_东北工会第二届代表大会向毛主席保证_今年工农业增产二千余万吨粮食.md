Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 25th: The Second Congress of the Northeast Trade Union was held in Shenyang from January 15th to 19th. The congress discussed the issue of vigorously promoting advanced experiences and strengthening trade union work. At the end of the meeting, all representatives wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to pay their respects. The original letter is as follows:

Dearest Chairman Mao:

Two years ago, you came to the Northeast and instructed us to build more machines, train cadres, and strive to build the Northeast into an industrial base. Your instruction gave us infinite strength, constantly encouraging us to move forward. Now, we respectfully report to you, on behalf of the 2.2 million workers in the entire Northeast: In the restoration and development of the Northeast's economy, in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and in the movement to increase production and practice economy, we have all carried out your instructions. In these movements, the Party continuously educated us and enhanced our political consciousness, enabling us to understand the position of the working class and the responsibilities we should bear. Now our labor productivity has reached 142 percent of the highest level before the liberation of the Northeast, and the proportion of the total industrial output value in the Northeast's national economy has increased from 35 percent in 1949 to 52 percent in 1951.

Since the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement last year, a new atmosphere has emerged among the working class in the Northeast: workers, technicians, and staff are more united, the unified leadership of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League in enterprises has been strengthened, working steps are more coordinated, and everyone is working together to study technology, improve tools, and launch a "finding the knack" movement in production and work, resulting in hundreds and thousands of production innovators and tens of thousands of advanced production methods. These advanced production methods are changing the face of Northeast industry every day and accelerating the speed of our national industrialization. For example, the improvement of smelting technology has greatly increased the output and quality of steel and iron; the emergence of high-speed cutting methods and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods in the machine industry has increased the efficiency of machine tools by one to more than ten times. From January to the end of November last year, the employees of our state-owned and public-owned enterprises have already increased production and practiced economy, creating wealth equivalent to 14.58 million tons of grain for the country. All of this shows the superiority of our people's democratic dictatorship system. Based on this system, the people of our country can unleash infinite power, a power that no enemy can defeat.

Chairman Mao, you are the most concerned about our lives. In the past three years, along with the development of production, our wages have increased year by year. Our food and clothing have changed, and we are living a happy life. Our culture has improved, and 502,000 workers have attended spare-time cultural schools, including 100,000 who were originally illiterate and have now escaped the pain of being "blind to characters." 180,000 people have participated in technical schools and technical research classes. All of this should be attributed to the Chinese Communist Party and your wise leadership. We thank you, and all the people thank you.

We have already seen that in the past, under your leadership, we were liberated; in the future, under your leadership, we will complete national industrialization and move towards a bright future of socialism and communism. We have now only taken the first step of the Long March. We firmly believe that under your leadership, all of this will be realized step by step.

Dearest Chairman Mao: We make the following guarantees to you: In order to accelerate the industrialization of the motherland, after we return to our factories, we must mobilize all employees to do the following work well:

First, carry through the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to the end, so that the fighting working class is not contaminated with any bad habits of the bourgeoisie, and repel the bourgeoisie's erosion and attack on us. Ensure the working class's leadership over the country, establish a new social atmosphere and new morality, and clear the way for large-scale economic construction and the increase production and practice economy movement.

Second, our total industrial output value this year will increase by 40.3 percent compared to last year, and the labor productivity of state-owned enterprises will increase by another 15 percent. We will also work with the peasants to increase production and practice economy, creating wealth equivalent to 22 million tons of grain for the country on the basis of last year's production. Chairman Mao, we must complete and exceed this task.

Third, universally launch a movement to learn from advanced production experience, vigorously promote advanced production methods, actively participate in technical and cultural learning, improve technology, and strive to achieve higher labor productivity.

Fourth, strive to study politics, study Marxism-Leninism and your works, further improve our consciousness, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and strengthen the unity of workers, technicians, and staff. Under the leadership of the Party, strengthen the unity of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League within state-owned enterprises, and do a good job of integrating production, education, and life around production. Under your leadership, we will move towards greater victories.

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of our working class!

    东北工会第二届代表大会向毛主席保证
    今年工农业增产二千余万吨粮食
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】东北工会第二届代表大会于一月十五日至十九日在沈阳举行，大会讨论了大力推广先进经验和加强工会工作问题。在会议结束时，全体代表写信向毛主席致敬，原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    两年以前，您来过东北，嘱咐我们，要多造机器，培养干部，努力把东北建设成为工业基地。您的这个指示，给了我们无穷的力量，时时刻刻鼓励着我们前进。现在，我们谨代表全东北二百二十万职工向您报告：在恢复和发展东北经济中，在抗美援朝运动、镇压反革命运动、增产节约运动中，我们都执行了您的指示。在这些运动中，党不断地教育我们，提高我们的政治觉悟，使我们认识了工人阶级的地位和应负的责任。现在我们的劳动生产率已相当东北解放前最高水平的百分之一百四十二，工业生产总值在东北国民经济中的比重，已由一九四九年的百分之三十五，提高到一九五一年的百分之五十二。
    去年开展增产节约运动以来，在东北工人阶级中，出现了新的气象：工人、技术人员和职员更加团结了，企业中，党、行政、工会、青年团的统一领导加强了，工作步骤更加协调，大家拧成一股劲，钻研技术，改进工具，在生产和工作中展开了找窍门运动，涌现出成百成千的生产革新者，成千成万的先进生产方法。这种先进生产方法，天天改变着东北工业的面貌，加快了我们国家工业化的速度。比如：冶炼技术的提高，大大提高了钢、铁的产量和质量；机器工业中高速切削法、多刀多刃切削法的出现，把机床的效能提高了一倍到十几倍。去年一月到十一月底，我们国营、公营企业的职工已经为国家增产节约了一千四百五十八万吨粮食的财富。这一切都说明了：我们人民民主专政制度的优越性。在这种制度的基础上，我国人民能够发挥无穷无尽的力量，这种力量是任何敌人所不能战胜的。
    毛主席，您是最关心我们生活的。三年来，跟着生产的发展，我们的工资一年比一年提高了。吃的、穿的都变了样，过着快乐的生活。我们的文化提高了，已经有五十万二千工人上了业余文化学校，其中十万人原来是文盲，现在已经摆脱了“睁眼瞎”的痛苦，参加技术学校、技术研究班的有十八万人。这都应该归功于中国共产党，归功于您的英明领导。我们感谢您，全体人民都感谢您。
    我们已经看到：过去，在您的领导下，我们得到了解放；今后，在您的领导下，我们将完成国家工业化，走向社会主义、共产主义的美好将来。我们现在只是走了万里长征的第一步。我们深信在您的领导下，这一切都会一步步实现的。
    亲爱的毛主席：我们向您提出保证：为了加速祖国的工业化，我们回到各工厂之后，一定要发动全体职工，做好以下工作：
    第一、把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，贯彻到底，不使战斗的工人阶级沾染一点资产阶级的恶习，打退资产阶级对我们的侵蚀和进攻。保证工人阶级对国家的领导，树立新的社会风气和新的道德，为大规模经济建设和增产节约运动扫清道路。
    第二、我们今年的工业生产总值还要比去年提高百分之四十点三，把国营企业的劳动生产率再提高百分之十五。我们还要和农民一起，在去年生产的基础上，再为国家增产节约二千二百万吨粮食的财富。毛主席，这个任务我们一定要完成和超过它。
    第三、普遍开展学习先进生产经验运动，大力推广先进生产方法，积极参加技术文化学习，提高技术，为达到更高的劳动生产率而奋斗。
    第四、努力学习政治，学习马克思列宁主义和您的著作，进一步提高觉悟，开展批评和自我批评，加强工人、技术人员、职员的团结。在党的领导下，加强国营企业内部党、行政、工会、青年团的团结，围绕着生产把生产、教育、生活三位一体的工作搞好。在您的领导下，向更大的胜利迈进。
    我们工人阶级的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
