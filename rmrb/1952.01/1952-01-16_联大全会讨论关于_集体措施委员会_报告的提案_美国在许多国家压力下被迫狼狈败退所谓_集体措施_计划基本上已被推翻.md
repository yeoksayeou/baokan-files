Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 15th: The United Nations General Assembly continued its plenary session on the 12th to discuss and vote on the eleven-nation proposal of the US-British bloc regarding the report of the so-called "Collective Measures Committee." As previously reported, the Political Committee had passed a revised version of the eleven-nation proposal, the content of which was vastly different from the original. The original proposal demanded the establishment of a so-called "collective measures" system in order to force UN member states to undertake the obligation of participating in US aggressive measures. However, the revised proposal guaranteed that countries that "generally support" so-called "collective measures" could, based on various reasons, not participate in such "collective measures." Therefore, the original plan of the United States has been fundamentally overturned.

The General Assembly plenary session on the 12th also discussed and voted on the revised Soviet proposal passed by the Political Committee. After extensive deletions, only the preamble and half of the second recommendation remained. The preamble, which requested confirmation that the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security belongs to the Security Council, was deleted. The truncated second recommendation called for convening periodic meetings of the Security Council to eliminate international tensions.

During the plenary session on the 12th, many representatives once again expressed their unwillingness to support the US "collective measures" system. The representative of Mexico said: "We believe that the eleven-nation proposal should not become a document forcing us to carry out new tasks." The representative of Syria specifically requested that it be recorded in the minutes that the Syrian delegation does not believe that Syria's vote in favor of the eleven-nation proposal equates to it being obligated to participate in "collective measures." The representative of India believed that establishing a "collective measures" system is inconsistent with the main purpose of the United Nations, which should be to strengthen international cooperation in good faith. He believed that if the General Assembly makes recommendations to countries based on this proposal, it may create greater divisions within the United Nations, filled with the dangers of war. The representative of Bolivia expressed resentment in his speech regarding the practice of economically oppressing small countries while demanding that they participate in "collective measures." He complained to the General Assembly about the overbearing behavior of the United States in forcing Bolivia to sell tin at low prices.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, delivered a concluding speech to the discussion. He emphatically stated that the "collective measures" plan orchestrated by the United States has been overturned by many countries, even those that have consistently supported its aggressive measures. He pointed out: "The amendments proposed by various countries to the eleven-nation proposal have substantially changed the proposal. For example, the amendments proposed by Near Eastern countries such as Egypt demanded that no measures be taken in a country based on the eleven-nation proposal without obtaining that country's freely and explicitly expressed consent. This amendment is directly opposed to the requirements in the original proposal." Vyshinsky said: "During the discussion, the United States has been forced to beat a disgraceful retreat across the board under pressure from many countries." He also mentioned that there was even an amendment that demanded the rejection of the "Collective Measures Committee" report (passing this report was the main part of the original proposal). He pointed out: "Countries have defied the orders of the United States and rebelled. Although they rebelled on their knees, they have rebelled nonetheless." At the same time, Vyshinsky also pointed out: "Even so, the revised proposal is still a plan for preparing another war."

The meeting finally passed the revised eleven-nation proposal with fifty votes in favor, five votes against (the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia, and Ukraine), and three abstentions (Argentina, India, and Indonesia); the Soviet proposal to convene periodic meetings of the Security Council was passed with fifty-seven votes in favor and zero votes against (Argentina and Kuomintang elements abstained).

    联大全会讨论关于“集体措施委员会”报告的提案
    美国在许多国家压力下被迫狼狈败退所谓“集体措施”计划基本上已被推翻
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会在十二日继续举行全体会议，讨论并表决了美英集团十一国关于所谓“集体措施委员会”报告的提案。前已报道，政治委员会曾通过了修正后的十一国提案，其内容与原来的十一国提案大不相同。原来的提案要求建立所谓“集体措施”制度，以便强迫联合国会员国承担参加美国的侵略措施的义务，但是修正后的提案，却保障“一般支持”所谓“集体措施”的国家可以根据各种理由不参加这种“集体措施”，因此，美国的原定计划已经在基本上被推翻了。
    十二日的大会全体会议也讨论并表决了政治委员会所通过的修正后的苏联提案，这个提案在大加删削以后，只剩下了序言和第二项建议的一半，序言中要求确认维护国际和平与安全的主要职责属于安全理事会，被删节后的第二项建议要求召开安全理事会定期会议以消除国际紧张局势。
    在十二日的全体会议上，许多代表发言时再度表示了不愿支持美国的“集体措施”制度。墨西哥代表说：我们认为十一国提案不应成为强制我们执行新任务的一个文件。叙利亚代表特别要求在议事纪录中记下：叙利亚代表团不认为叙利亚投票赞成十一国提案就等于它负有参加“集体措施”的义务。印度代表认为，建立“集体措施”制度与联合国应依照善意加强国际合作的主要宗旨不一致，他认为，大会如果根据这个提案向各国提出建议，就可能在联合国中造成充满战争危险的更大的分裂。玻利维亚的代表在发言中对于在要求小国参加“集体措施”的同时在经济上压迫这些小国的行为表示愤懑，他向大会申诉了美国强迫玻利维亚低价卖锡的专横行为。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基作了总结讨论的发言。他着重地说明了，美国所策划的“集体措施”方案已经被许多甚至一向支持它的侵略措施的国家所推翻了。他指出：各国对十一国提案所提出的修正案，已经在实质上改变了这个提案，例如埃及等近东国家所提出的修正案，要求不得在没有征得某一个国家自由地、明确地表示同意以前，就在这个国家中根据十一国提案而采取任何措施。这个修正案是直接反对原提案中的要求的。维辛斯基说：在讨论过程中，美国已在许多国家的压力下从全线狼狈败退。他也谈到还有一项修正案甚至要求拒绝通过
    “集体措施委员会”的报告（通过这个报告是原提案的主要部分）。他指出：各国已违抗美国的命令而造反了。尽管是跪着造反，但毕竟是造反了。同时，维辛斯基也指出：虽然如此，修正后的提案仍然是准备另一次战争的方案。
    会议最后以五十票对五票（苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、白俄罗斯和乌克兰）通过了修正后的十一国提案（阿根廷、印度和印尼弃权）；以五十七票对零票通过了苏联关于召开安全理事会定期会议的提案（阿根廷和国民党分子弃权）。
