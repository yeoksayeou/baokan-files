    East China and Southwest Military Regions Vigorously Launch Anti-Corruption Struggle
    Heads of Southwest Provincial Military Regions Personally "Go to the Front Lines" to Mobilize the Masses
    [By Our Newspaper] The East China Military Region is leading its subordinate units in vigorously launching a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Prior to January 7th, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle in the units of the East China Military Region stationed in Nanjing was stuck in the stage of studying documents and practicing thrift. On January 5th, the Military Region began to implement the policy of vigorous and swift action, and on the 6th, it held another mobilization meeting, adopting the method of naming names and demanding confessions within a limited time. At the same time, all unnecessary activities were suspended to concentrate time and effort to break through the stagnation of the movement. Under the swift and decisive leadership taking the lead in self-examination, the masses in various units wrote letters exposing acts of corruption and waste, and demanded that rallies be held for struggle sessions. On January 10th and 11th, the leadership convened a cadre meeting of the troops stationed in Nanjing, announcing on the spot the suspension of Zhang Lin, director of the General Headquarters Administration Department, and Wu Qiang, deputy director of the Political Department's Cultural Department, pending investigation. The masses were extremely excited and rushed to expose corruption and waste phenomena and the bureaucratic work style of leading cadres. At the meeting, Liu Yande, the Cultural Minister of a certain unit, attempted to suppress criticism and was severely rebuked by the masses. The leadership announced on the spot the suspension of Liu Yande pending investigation. Wang Guifu, deputy director of the General Headquarters Administration Department, who had been suspended before the meeting due to suspicion of corruption, ran onto the stage from the crowd and took out gold bracelets and other赃物 (plundered goods/ill-gotten gains) from his pocket, confessing his corruption over the years. Representatives from various units also successively made review reports on behalf of their units at the meeting. Some units, whose reviews were poor, were severely criticized on the spot. As a result of this mobilization, the movement expanded rapidly.
  [By Our Newspaper] The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle in the Southwest Military Region is being vigorously launched. From December 31st of last year to January 9th of this year, the organs and troops directly under the Military Region have comprehensively and with focus shifted to the anti-corruption struggle. He Long, Commander of the Southwest Military Region, and Deng Xiaoping, Secretary of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, put forward the requirement to fully launch this struggle within a limited time of ten days, and named Yao Jiming (Deputy Minister of the Logistics Department of the Military Region), Zhou Jiuyin (Minister of the Quartermaster Department), Huang Yiren (Minister of the Ordnance Department), and Tian Chengxiang (Deputy Minister of the Ordnance Department) to conduct in-depth self-reflection at a cadre meeting. The masses were extremely excited. Corrupt elements have nowhere to hide, and many have confessed to acts of corruption.
    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle in the Southwest Military Region generally starts with checking and exposing extravagance and waste, then proceeds to exposing corruption, and from exposing general middle and small corruption to engaging in major corruption, expanding from internal confession and reporting to external investigation. At present, in addition to continuing to mobilize the masses to deeply oppose general corruption phenomena, the units directly under the Military Region have focused on fighting major corrupt elements and are cooperating with local authorities to counter-attack奸商 (unscrupulous merchants/profiteers). The situation of internal and external attacks has already taken shape, and major clues of corruption have been successively discovered. For example, when the Ordnance Department established the Xinhua Construction Factory, it invested 21 billion, and hired three奸商 (unscrupulous merchants/profiteers) as deputy managers. Dong Ruichang, one of the奸商 (unscrupulous merchants/profiteers), originally had only 70 million in capital, but after becoming a deputy manager, he opened an auction house and a brick factory, and his capital quickly increased to more than 1 billion. He also deposited 500 million of public funds into private banks. He alone evaded more than 1 billion in taxes.
    The Southwest Military Region has instructed all provincial military regions to launch an anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle within a limited time. In order to urge and guide the provincial military regions to quickly carry out this struggle, Li Da, Chief of Staff of the Military Region, Wang Xinting, Deputy Director of the Political Department, and others have gone to Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Yunnan and other places to personally arrange the work. After receiving the instructions, most of the provincial military regions made urgent arrangements. Heads of the Guizhou, Southern Sichuan, Northern Sichuan, and Eastern Sichuan Provincial Military Regions personally "went to the front lines," combined self-criticism with mobilization reports, and mobilized leaders at all levels to take the lead in making confessions and reports. The movement generally developed faster.

    华东西南军区猛烈展开反贪污斗争
    西南各省军区首长亲自“上前线”发动群众
     【本报讯】华东军区领导所属猛烈展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争。在一月七日以前，华东军区驻南京部队各单位的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争停顿在学文件搞节约的阶段，一月五日，军区开始贯彻执行大张旗鼓雷厉风行的方针，并在六日再度召开动员大会，采取限期点名坦白的办法，同时，停止一切不必要的活动，集中时间集中力量突破运动的现状。在领导方面雷厉风行地带头检查下，各单位群众纷纷写信检举贪污浪费行为，并且要求举行大会进行斗争。领导方面在一月十日、十
    一日召开了驻南京各部队的干部大会，当场宣布司令部管理处长张林、政治部文化部副部长吴强停职听候审查。群众情绪极为振奋，争先恐后地起来揭发贪污浪费现象和领导干部的官僚主义作风。会上，某部文化部长刘彦德企图压制批评，受到群众严厉的斥责。领导方面当场宣布刘彦德停职听候审查。因有贪污嫌疑、会前已被停职的军区司令部管理处副处长王桂馥从人丛中跑上台去，从衣袋中拿出金镯子等赃物，坦白了他几年来的贪污情形。各单位的代表也都相继在大会上代表本单位作了检讨报告。其中有些单位检讨得较差，就当场受到严厉的批评。这样发动的结果，运动迅速扩大。
  【本报讯】西南军区反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，正雷厉风行地展开。从去年十二月三十一日到今年一月九日十天中，军区直属各机关部队，已全面有重点地转入反贪污斗争。西南军区贺龙司令员、中共中央西南局书记邓小平同志提出限期十天，全面展开这一斗争的要求，并在干部大会上当场指名姚继鸣（军区后勤部副部长）、周九银（军需部部长）、黄以仁（军械部部长）、田呈祥（军械部副部长）等人进行深刻反省。群众情绪十分激昂。贪污分子已无藏身之地，不少人交代了贪污事实。
    西南军区反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，一般是先从检查、揭发铺张浪费现象入手，然后进而揭发贪污，并由揭发一般的中、小贪污到搞大贪污，从内部坦白检举扩展到外部检查。军区直属部队各单位目前除继续发动群众深入反对一般的贪污现象外，已有重点地转入斗争大贪污分子，并与当地配合起来向奸商进行反攻。现在内外夹攻的形势已经形成，重大的贪污线索已陆续被发现，如军械部在开办新华营建厂时，投资二百一十亿，竟聘三个奸商当副经理。其中之一的奸商董瑞昌原来只有资本七千万元，当副经理后，开了拍卖行、砖瓦厂，资本竟迅速增加到十余亿元。他又把五亿公款存入私人银行。他一人就漏税十亿多元。
    西南军区已指示各省军区限期展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争。为了督促和指导各省军区迅速开展这一斗争，军区参谋长李达、政治部副主任王新亭等已分别前往川东、川西、西康、贵州、云南等地，亲自布置工作。各省军区在接到指示后，大都作了紧急布置。贵州、川南、川北、川东等省军区首长亲自“上前线”，结合自我检讨进行动员报告，而且动员各级负责人层层带头，进行坦白检举，运动一般都开展得较快。
