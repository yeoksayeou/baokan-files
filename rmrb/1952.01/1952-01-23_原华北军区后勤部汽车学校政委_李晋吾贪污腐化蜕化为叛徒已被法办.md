Li Jinwu, Embezzled and Became a Traitor and Has Been Dealt With According to Law

Li Jinwu, the Political Commissar of the Automotive School of the Transportation Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, embezzled, stole funds and fled, degenerating into a traitor to the revolution. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Party Committee of the Military Region has decided to expel him from the Party and he has been arrested and dealt with according to law by the military court. Li Jinwu was a veteran cadre who participated in the Long March. He joined the revolution more than 20 years ago, joined the Communist Youth League in 1930, and became a member of the Communist Party in 1931. He served successively as Director of the Political Department of the Regiment, Political Commissar of the Regiment, Deputy Political Commissar and Director of the Political Department of the Military Sub-district, and Political Commissar of the Military and Political Cadre School of the Provincial Military Region. Because he did not seek progress politically and was infected with the decadent and luxurious ideas of the exploiting classes, he made mistakes such as embezzlement and violation of policies as early as 1946 when he served as Deputy Political Commissar of the Military Sub-district. He was criticized three times within the Party and was given a public warning within the Party and a demotion in administration. However, for a long time, he did not sincerely repent of his past mistakes. Instead, he used a double-dealing attitude to cover up his mistakes and muddle through the Party rectification and the Three Check-ups movements, rejecting the Party's education and comrades' criticism. He was complacent and arrogantly believed: "I have been in the revolution for more than 20 years and fought all over half of China. Today, the whole country has achieved victory, and enjoyment and corruption are all right (!), and making mistakes will not be severely punished." Therefore, after entering the big cities, the ideas of enjoyment and corruption developed more seriously. Profiteers and the remnants of counter-revolutionaries seized on his weaknesses and launched a fierce attack on him with sugar-coated bullets. For example, when Li Jinwu was in a certain city, the manager of a certain inn, seeing that he was wearing a woolen military uniform, busily lit his cigarette, poured tea, and served him very attentively. Hearing that he spoke with a southern accent, he kept complimenting him as a "veteran revolutionary," "a great contributor," and "very extraordinary." Seeing that his wife was not by his side, he wanted to "find him a girlfriend to play with" and "guaranteed to find one" and "guaranteed to be satisfied." All the flattery and flattery of this manager to Li Jinwu were to achieve his own despicable and vicious goals. For example, he planned to borrow a sum of money from Li Jinwu to repair the house and open a restaurant: he let the daughter of a drug offender have illicit relations with Li Jinwu, and let Li Jinwu come forward to the court to get the drug offender who was being detained out, etc. As a Communist Party member, a veteran cadre, and a political commissar, Li Jinwu completely lost his political vigilance and fell deeper and deeper into the quagmire of corruption and degeneration, and finally became a thief who stole state assets and a captive of the bourgeoisie, profiteers, and reactionaries. In addition to whoring and opium smoking, spending more than 2.6 million yuan, he also seriously lost his position, shielded the son of a counter-revolutionary element, falsely claimed to be "uncle and nephew," and privately arranged for him to work in the school. In March of last year, when Li Jinwu came to Beijing to attend the Logistics Party Congress, after the responsible comrades of the Transportation Department pointed out the above mistakes to him, he repeatedly denied them. Later, he embezzled more than 30 million yuan of public funds and fled in fear of crime; but he was finally captured by our public security organs. In order to enforce discipline, educate the entire army, resist the influence of bourgeois ideology, and maintain the purity of our party and our army ideologically and organizationally, the Party Committee of the North China Military Region announced the expulsion of Li Jinwu from the Party and published this decision in the Party newspaper. The "North China Liberation Army" newspaper of the North China Military Region specially published an editorial and opened a special column on "Criticism of Li Jinwu's Thought," and organized extensive discussions in the organs and troops of the entire military region. The Party committees, political organs, and the vast number of Party members and cadres in many units attached great importance to this discussion, and many units were presided over or participated in by the leaders. This discussion has had a certain effect on raising the ideological awareness of Party members and cadres and preventing the invasion of exploiting class ideology. The criticism of Li Jinwu's thought has played a certain role in promoting the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the entire military region. (Shang Zhansi)

    原华北军区后勤部汽车学校政委
    李晋吾贪污腐化蜕化为叛徒已被法办
    华北军区后勤部运输部汽车学校政治委员李晋吾，贪污腐化、窃款潜逃，蜕化为革命的叛徒，军区党的纪律检查委员会已决定开除他的党籍，并已由军法处把他逮捕法办。李晋吾是参加过长征的老干部，参加革命已二十多年，一九三○年参加共产主义青年团，一九三一年转为共产党员，历任团政治处主任、团政治委员、军分区副政治委员兼政治部主任、省军区军政干部学校政治委员等职。因他政治上不求进步，沾染了剥削阶级的享乐腐化思想，在一九四六年任军分区副政治委员时，就曾发生贪污、违反政策等错误，先后受到党内三次批评，并受到党内当众警告和行政上撤职的处分。但他在长时间内并没有真诚地痛改前非，反而用阳奉阴违的两面态度，掩饰错误，混过了整党、三查等运动，拒绝了党的教育和同志的批评。他居功自傲，狂妄地认为：“我革命二十多年，打遍了半个中国，今天全国取得了胜利，享乐腐化都应该（！），犯错误也不会受严重的处分。”因而在进入大城市后，享乐腐化思想更加严重地发展起来。奸商及反革命的残余分子就抓住了他的弱点，用糖衣裹着的炮弹，向他展开了猛烈的进攻。如李晋吾在某市时，某客栈经理见他穿着呢子军服，就忙着给他点烟倒茶，伺候得非常殷勤；听见他谈话是南方口音，就一个劲地恭维他是“老革命”、“功劳真大”、“太不简单”；见他妻子不在身边，就要给他“找个女朋友玩玩”，并“保险找到”和“保险满意”。这个经理对李晋吾的一切逢迎和谄媚，都是为了达到自己的卑鄙恶毒的目的。如：他打算向李晋吾借一笔钱，修理房屋，再开个饭馆子：他让毒品犯的女儿和李晋吾通奸，让李晋吾出头向法院把正在扣押着的毒品犯要出来等等。而身为共产党员、老干部，又担任着政治委员工作的李晋吾，竟完全丧失政治警惕，在贪污腐化的泥坑里越陷越深，终于变成偷窃国家资财的盗贼，资产阶级、奸商、反动分子的俘虏。他除了嫖妓女、吸料面，先后挥霍达二百六十多万元外，并严重丧失立场，包庇反革命分子的儿子，伪称“叔侄”关系，私自安插在学校里工作。去年三月间，李晋吾来北京参加后勤党代表大会，经运输部负责同志给他指出以上的错误后，他还再三抵赖。后来，他畏罪盗窃公款三千多万元潜逃；但终于被我公安机关捕获。为了严肃纪律，教育全军，抵制资产阶级思想的影响，从思想上、组织上保持我党我军的纯洁，华北军区党委宣布开除李晋吾的党籍，并在党报上公布这一决定。华北军区部队报纸“华北解放军”报曾专门发表了社论，辟出了“李晋吾思想批判”专栏，在全军区的机关、部队中组织了广泛的讨论。许多单位的党委、政治机关及广大的党员、干部，对这个讨论都非常重视，有不少单位都由首长负责主持或参加。这次讨论，在提高党员、干部的思想觉悟和防止剥削阶级思想的侵袭上，有一定的效果。对李晋吾思想的批判，已在全军区反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动中起了一定的推动作用。（商展思）
