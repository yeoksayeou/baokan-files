If we abandon the metaphor, then we can only understand the British Prime Minister's speech in this way: he admitted that British foreign policy is following a wrong course, which has put Britain in such a difficult position. This is evident from the next paragraph of Churchill's speech, which says: Britain is facing a financial crisis and needs to make many efforts. Churchill said that it needs to use "the entire strength of our country" to stop "going downhill, and returning to level ground, and then we must work hard from the beginning."

But the situation in Britain is like this, how can it work hard? Churchill himself has said: If the income and expenditure of the British treasury cannot be balanced, the British state may face bankruptcy, and as Churchill said, "must choose between begging for alms—if we can get them—and going hungry."

Churchill pointed out that Britain is facing a different danger than in 1940.

Churchill said: "Neither nationally nor individually can we live beyond our means forever. We cannot always rely on American aid in addition to the defense and rearmament work of the Allies"... He said: "We must never again ask our empire for help. All these are cold facts, and cannot be changed by speeches, editorials, lobbying, voting, etc. Facts are facts. So, what can be seen from this?" Churchill continued: "If we cannot even more closely exert our strength, wisdom, and skills to obtain survival, then we will have no chance to settle the millions of surplus people in the country who cannot be fed by food, and at the same time we have no guarantee that others will raise the British lion as a beloved domestic animal."

This is the current situation in Britain due to the policy of expanding armaments and the continuous increase in military expenditure.

However, as Mr. Churchill himself admitted, the only assistance that Britain can expect from the United States is assistance regarding the plan for continued expansion of armaments, because Eisenhower and the forces behind him that not only determine the direction of American foreign policy but also determine the direction of the foreign policy of other members of the Atlantic group, do not allow the plan for expanding armaments to be reduced.

The contradictions between the major powers in the Atlantic group camp are growing and intensifying, and the difficulties within the camp are constantly increasing.

The Internal Contradictions of the Imperialist Camp are Deepening; the United States is Trying to Intensify Arming West Germany as an Ally

Now, everyone knows that the Schuman Plan is indeed a tool used by American monopoly capital to control the heavy industry of several Western European countries—France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg—but its intention is not limited to this. According to Professor Lavenir of the Sorbonne in his book "The Schuman Plan," this plan is aimed at Britain, and in Professor Lavenir's words, is "the most dangerous war machine established in nearly a century and a half to deal with 'perfidious Albion'." He also said: "The 'European Society' established by joint ventures is actually a permanent industrial alliance, and its goal is to drive British metal products out of all export markets. After establishing such a 'society,' its internal members can establish a professional division of labor for production tasks, which will greatly help them defeat British industry in the markets of third countries. However, since the Schuman Plan is nothing more than an effective economic war waged by our six countries against British power, is it possible that it will not affect Britain's policy towards us at all? From now on, we should prepare to encounter Britain's resolute hostility around the world."

This is the result of the favorable influence of the Atlantic Pact. Obviously, this proves the contradiction between Britain and the United States, the contradiction between Britain and France, and all its consequences. This is the contradiction that divides the imperialist camp. Gentlemen, you should look for the root of your difficulties here. There is a good Russian saying: "Don't blame the mirror for being ugly if your own face is."

This is the way Anglo-French relations are. However, things are not limited to this. Everyone knows that the Schuman Plan has received strong support from the United States, precisely because of this, the Schuman Plan and the Pleven Plan are both called American Plans, and even the former Chairman of the European Consultative Assembly, Spaak, said so. The United States believes that the Schuman Plan is mainly a suitable means to guarantee the position of the United States in the economic aspect, while the Pleven Plan is a means to guarantee the same position in the military aspect. Both plans are intended to ensure the dominance of American monopoly capital and the West German monopoly capital colluding with them in Western Europe.

Both the Schuman Plan and the Pleven Plan will in fact lead to the re-militarization of West Germany, which is incompatible with the interests of European peace, and is also condemned by the German people, who do not want to be used as tools to realize other people's plans, especially plans that are pursuing aggressive goals. According to the Pleven Plan, several Western European countries will form a unified army, in which the West German army will undoubtedly occupy a dominant position. Similarly, after the so-called "European Coal and Steel Community" is formed according to the Schuman Plan, the heavy industry in the Ruhr will be united with the heavy industry in France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, creating conditions for the Ruhr industrial giants to maintain control over the production of weapons and military supplies in Western Europe. This is again in line with the intentions of the American monopolists, who have used and are using the occupying regime in West Germany to firmly penetrate German trusts and cartels and make them willing to serve the realization of their aggressive plans.

However, recently, the plan to establish a "European Army" with the participation of the British army has been resisted by Britain, which has refused to participate in such an army. This was personally said by Churchill in his parliamentary speech on December 6, 1951. He said that Britain does not intend to participate in the European Army...

However, Britain's attitude towards this issue is completely contrary to the intentions of the American military, because the American military also wants to take over the control of the British armed forces. However, the United States, encountering British resistance, is becoming more enthusiastic about rebuilding the German Wehrmacht, wanting to regard it as a reliable ally in the Atlantic army. For this reason, the United States is strongly supporting the revival of militarist groups and neo-Nazi groups in West Germany, which have recruited a large number of German generals, officers, soldiers, and active Nazis who sell revenge sentiments.

According to authoritative sources, the Americans in the Allied High Commission in West Germany are prepared to merge all these militaristic groups. In September 1951, eight German generals held a meeting in Bonn, and the American Deputy High Commissioner, Major General Hayes, also participated. The plan to build the West German army into a model army in the Atlantic Treaty system was drafted by him.

The German generals who participated in this meeting were: Friessner, who is now the acting leader of a neo-Nazi group; Manteuffel, a recognized representative of German militarism; Major General Ramcke, the founder of Hitler's paratrooper force, who was originally sentenced and imprisoned in Belgium for crimes against humanity, and was recently released under the pretext of amnesty; and air force generals Stumpff and Student.

It is learned from the same source that at the end of August 1951, the American High Commissioner to West Germany, McCloy, said that as long as the institutions of the Atlantic Alliance decide to arm West Germany and announce the mobilization of the German "combat troops," the West German armed forces in the unified European army can be established within 18 months and be in a state of full readiness. McCloy confirmed that as long as the arming of West Germany is formally approved, the United States will begin to provide military assistance to West Germany, even if it is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As for the issue of West Germany's military production, McCloy said that West Germany can produce "light materials," equipment, instruments, motors, electrical equipment, and trucks for the armed forces of the Atlantic Alliance.

On General Eisenhower's side, he also personally expressed his great hope for the revival of the West German regular army. On November 26, he frankly admitted at the North Atlantic Alliance meeting in Rome that the United States needs German help both geographically and militarily, and said that if the United States can use German power to continue to organize the European army, the United States will achieve its goals faster.

The US, British and French Aggressive Policies are Resisted Everywhere, so They Fabricate Base Lies to Cover Up Their Crimes

What are these purposes? There is no secret about these purposes. These purposes are very clear and definite. These purposes are determined by the policies of the aggressive forces in the United States, Britain, and France, which, as Stalin said to a reporter from "Pravda" in February 1951, are eager for a new war in order to seek excess profits and plunder other countries. Are not the flames of war already burning in many places in the East—Korea, Vietnam, Malaya? Are these flames not ignited by the aggressive policies of the colonial countries?—colonial countries that are trying to use force to stop the national liberation movements of the Asian people who have awakened and demand to live a new life. Do not even the representatives of the colonial countries themselves have to admit that the question is how to maintain their colonial control and ensure that they can continue to exploit and oppress the people of other countries? Did not General Tassigny, the commander-in-chief of France in Indochina, publicly say that what France is doing in Indochina and what the United States is doing in Korea are the same thing, and that the war that France is conducting in Asia is not only about the existence of Indochina, but also about the existence of Southeast Asia and even the entire Asia?

The general said: "Losing Southeast Asia would mean that communism will obtain major strategic raw materials, Japan's economy will be permanently unbalanced, and the entire Asia will be threatened."

It is not necessary to expose the special nature of the claims about communism and the so-called threat looming over all of Asia. Bringing up the issue of communism is only to cover up the aggressive goals of the Atlantic Group and to deceive the people of all countries.

The goals that Britain is pursuing in Malaya, the goals that the United States, Britain, and France are jointly pursuing in the Middle East and Near East are the same as the goals that the United States is pursuing in Korea and France is pursuing in Vietnam. In the Middle East and Near East, the United States, Britain, and France are concentrating their efforts to maintain their control in the various countries in this region, preventing the people of the Middle East and Near East from being liberated from foreign oppression, so as to continue to fatten themselves on the poverty and destruction of the people of the countries in this region; for example, this can be seen particularly clearly from the actions of the imperialist countries in Iran and Egypt. All of this is now being covered up by them with hypocritical words. They say that they are concerned about the well-being of the people of the countries in this region, saying that they have only one goal: to enable the people of this region to have a "free" life, and they are only carrying out their "liberation mission"; incidentally, the American government's appropriation of 100 million US dollars to carry out subversive and terrorist activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is also said in such a hypocritical way.

The speeches about the Communist Information Bureau, "Red Imperialism," and "Communist Threat" are also equally false. Mr. Acheson and Mr. Churchill (as I have mentioned) have recently talked about these things, and everyone else—the leaders of the Atlantic Group—is also talking about them in this way. The insightful words of the leader of the Soviet people, Stalin, in a similar situation as early as 1939 can be fully applied to these false speeches. At that time, the fascist culprits—Hitler Germany, fascist Italy, and imperialist Japan—were establishing their war group, their "axis," trying to make it seem as if they were fighting against the Communist International and the "Communist Threat."

Stalin said at the time: "This is how the aggressor lords are trying to win over public opinion, although this is obviously a stupid trick of covering one's ears and stealing a bell; because it is ridiculous to look for the 'base' of the Communist International in the Mongolian desert, in the Abyssinian mountains, and in the dense forests of Spanish Morocco."

The American So-called "Collective Measures" Plan Destroys the Principle of Unanimity of the Five Great Powers in the Security Council

If we turn back to the report of the "Collective Measures" Committee and compare this report with the principles, purposes, and tasks of the United Nations, then it can be easily seen that this report obviously completely disregards the principles, purposes, and tasks of the United Nations Charter.

What is surprising first of all is the committee's plan to establish a military executive agency with particularly broad powers. This agency is responsible for directing the activities of various countries and organizing the armed forces placed under its command. Any country, even a country that is not in the conflict area, may be appointed as a military executor. Here I must talk about this in passing, which can explain the doubts of the respectable Swedish representative. He said: He does not understand why the countries of the "Eastern Group" (as he calls it) attack the regional agreements of the Atlantic Group. It is precisely because it is not a regional agreement at all, because it has no boundaries—it extends to the Pacific Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea and includes the entire world—that people oppose it. What kind of regional agreement is this? What does Article 51 of the United Nations Charter have to do with it? This is an obvious mockery of the Charter and Article 51. As pointed out in Section 202 of the report, such an executor may only be a country adjacent to this area, especially if the armed forces of this country participate in combat,... if this country fully utilizes its war potential. Everyone knows that the United States is doing everything in its power to entrust the power of such military agencies to it. The fact that the American government is striving to include the American troops stationed on the territory of other countries under the terms of the aggressive Atlantic Pact into the so-called "United Nations Armed Forces" also illustrates this point. These actions fully reveal the true intention of the American government to use the recommendations put forward by the committee to embezzle the name of the United Nations to cover up America's aggressive policies.

However, this suggestion of the committee seriously violates the United Nations Charter. The United Nations Charter stipulates that the Military Staff Committee, which conducts activities under the guidance of the Security Council, is the only agency that directs military operations in the struggle against aggression. In contrast to the decision of the Security Council is the decision of the General Assembly; the Security Council has the principle of unanimity of the permanent members to fully guarantee that the decisions it takes are correct. The decisions of the General Assembly are taken without the guarantees stipulated by the United Nations Charter for the Security Council. The decision of the Security Council, in this case, requires the unanimous adoption of all the permanent members of the Security Council and at least two non-permanent members. This is indeed the true guarantee established by the great principle that lays the foundation for our organization, that is: in resolving major issues, there must be the unanimous agreement of the five great powers of the Security Council, if the resolution of such issues will produce major decisions that may lead to war.

Therefore, we say that it is fundamentally meaningless to hand over this power to the General Assembly, which decides such issues by a simple majority or even a two-thirds majority. We have seen how such a two-thirds majority is put together, and we have unfortunately understood this from practical experience. This is not a guarantee of defending peace and preventing war, because handing over the rights of the Military Staff Committee to the General Assembly, like handing over the rights of the Security Council to the General Assembly and handing over the rights of the Security Council to the military executive agency without attaching the guarantees established by the United Nations Charter and its principles, is not a guarantee of peace, but a dangerous road, or, in the words of the Swedish representative here, a "possible war danger."

The American representative here reiterated the following passage made by Molotov in San Francisco. Molotov said:

"Only when this prerequisite is already available, and actions that undermine peace or threats to peace will not be exempt from punishment and adequate punitive measures will not be delayed, can the international security mechanism take on the responsibility of maintaining peace."

I thank the American representative for quoting this important speech by Molotov. In return, I would also like to recall a passage that Mr. Stettinius, then US Secretary of State, said at the time. Stettinius said that if one of these countries (he was referring to the permanent members of the Security Council) embarked on the road of aggression, the result would be a great war, regardless of what decisions the Security Council might take on membership and voting procedures. The United Nations Charter did not give the great powers any power that they did not actually have. Even without the United Nations Charter, the power of these countries to maintain or destroy peace already existed. Stettinius said that all the United Nations Charter did was to place special, binding obligations on the great powers, which require them to use the power in their hands jointly and harmoniously for peace, rather than unilaterally for war.

The Four-Power Declaration of San Francisco on June 7, 1945, said: Therefore, in order to make it possible for the Security Council to pass resolutions by a majority vote, the only feasible way is to stipulate that resolutions on non-procedural matters require the unanimous consent of the permanent members, plus the affirmative votes of at least two non-permanent members.

This statement also pointed out: The resolutions and actions of the Security Council may produce significant political consequences and may even cause a series of events that may eventually require the Security Council to fulfill its duties and take coercive measures.

This is in line with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.

The statement continued: The beginning of this series of events is when the Security Council decides to conduct an investigation, or believes that the time has come to require countries to resolve their... disputes, or to make recommendations to countries.

From the above, the issue of who should make the decision and how to make the decision on determining whether the actions of one country or another are acts of aggression, and the issue of who should make the decision and how to make the decision on the struggle against aggression, is of great significance both in principle and in practical application. Giving this right to the Security Council and stipulating that the Security Council must adhere to the basic principle of unanimity of the five permanent members when deciding on non-procedural matters is a very important guarantee that objectivity and impartiality can be maintained when deciding on issues related to ensuring international peace and security. This situation alone is enough for us to see that the committee's recommendations, which flagrantly violate the main principles of the United Nations Charter, are completely unacceptable. This situation violates the Charter because it transfers this power and all its guarantees, this right belonging to the Security Council and all its guarantees, and these powers of the Security Council to the General Assembly, to the so-called military executive agency, that is, only to one country, to Eisenhower, to Bradley, who are military men and will naturally act according to their own methods. There is an old French saying: "What you sell, you shout about."

This is a serious violation of the principles of the Charter. We cannot help but be surprised that legal experts like Mr. Cohen can say that "collective measures" are completely in line with the Charter.

The Security Council Cannot Have a Unanimous Decision on Issues Because of the Arbitrary Attitude of the United States, Britain, and France

However, it is not only this that violates the Charter. We can say: Every recommendation in the entire report is a serious violation of the Charter.

If evidence is needed, one can look at Chapter II, which discusses political collective measures. From the provisions of this chapter, it is easy to see that the recommendation authorizing the General Assembly to decide on the severance of diplomatic relations is a complete violation of the Charter, because according to Article 41 of the Charter, this right is entirely within the scope of the Security Council's powers. The same should also be said about economic measures such as the implementation of embargoes and the complete or partial blockade of trade (including exports and imports), the prohibition of certain or all financial transactions, the prohibition of private contact, and the seizure of deposits or property. Similarly, all these measures, which are based on Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter, can only be taken by the Security Council.

Here it must also be reminded that Articles 46 and 47 of the Charter stipulate the responsibilities of the Military Staff Committee. These two articles stipulate that the Staff Committee is under the Security Council and is responsible for the strategic command of any army submitted to the Security Council for disposal. However, these powers are now transferred to the military executive agency, which is a blatant violation of the Charter.

Part II of Chapter IV of this report, "Military Measures," mentions the resolution on "United Action for Peace," which recommends that each member state of the United Nations withdraw a portion of its armed forces, train, organize, and equip them so that they can be immediately used as combat forces of the United Nations when the Security Council or the General Assembly makes a recommendation. Giving such powers to the United Nations General Assembly is also a violation of the Charter, which assigns these powers to the Security Council in Chapter VII, and only to this one body. According to Article 43 of the Charter, if the army of a certain country is needed to maintain international peace, the Security Council must make a request to that country according to a special agreement on this issue and make these armies subject to the Security Council's dispatch. No other body has this power.

Article 45 of the Charter stipulates that the amount that a country should prepare, and the degree of readiness that the air force units required for international joint sanction actions should be in, should be decided by the Security Council with the assistance of the Military Staff Committee.

From all these aspects, there is no reason to establish a certain military executive agency with extraordinary powers. Such an agency has already been established—this is the Military Staff Committee; such power already exists—this is Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Everything that the report of the so-called "Collective Measures" Committee says on this issue cannot be implemented by any agency other than the Security Council, but can only be implemented by the Security Council through a decision. If such powers are given to any other agency established in accordance with the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly of the year before last or any other resolution of the General Assembly, it is a serious violation of the Charter, an unreasonable action, and an usurpation of the powers belonging to the Security Council and can only belong to the Security Council. Such "collective measures" undermine the entire Charter and the fundamental spirit of the Charter.

All the provisions of the Charter are so easily abandoned by the so-called "Collective Measures" Committee and replaced by the provisions in its report.

In order to justify these illegal measures, the report of the "Collective Measures" Committee says that before the agreement stipulated in Article 43 of the United Nations Charter is concluded, the United Nations General Assembly strives to guarantee its armed forces.

However, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, on the one hand, are taking such steps, and on the other hand, they are not trying to genuinely conclude the agreement stipulated in Article 43. Obviously, they want to use the situation caused by their own wrong attitude on this issue to achieve their illegal purposes. Is this not clear to everyone?

It should be reminded to the committee that the recommendation to the Security Council adopted by the Fifth United Nations General Assembly has not yet been implemented; that recommendation requires the Security Council to formulate measures stipulated in Articles 43, 45, 46, and 47 of the United Nations Charter as soon as possible—these articles stipulate that the member states of the United Nations place their armies under the command of the Security Council and stipulate that the Military Staff Committee effectively perform its duties. The US-British group has not taken any action to implement this resolution, which is obviously because the implementation of this resolution would make all these so-called "collective measures" and military executive agencies and their illegal activities lose their basis and completely collapse.

This is not surprising at all, because the American government is absolutely not concerned about the implementation of this decision. Please note that Mr. Cohen, the American representative, said frankly yesterday: When the time comes and Article 43 of the United Nations Charter can be put into effect, the experience of the United Nations in planning collective action and formulating security systems may be helpful for the implementation of this article of the Charter.

This passage shows that the American government does not believe that the time for implementing Article 43 has come. It is not even known when this time will come, or whether it will come at all. If people look at the actions of the American government in this regard, they can determine that this time will not come. There is no doubt that Article 43, like other articles in the United Nations Charter that are related to the issues we are discussing, like the United Nations Charter itself, has been put aside by the US-British group a long time ago. Only on solemn occasions, only when it is necessary to quote the Charter to cover up illegal actions that violate the Charter, is the Charter remembered, and the purpose is to use this method to deceive public opinion in order to achieve their goals, which directly contradict the purposes stated in the Charter.

In order to make people understand that the above opinions are fair, it should also be mentioned the difficulties encountered by the Military Staff Committee in its work—formulating a plan for the organization of the United Nations armed forces.

Some say that the Military Staff Committee and the Security Council cannot produce positive results because of their lack of capacity, and that their lack of capacity is caused by the stubborn attitude of the Soviet representative. This statement is completely unfounded.

In fact, the reason why the Military Staff Committee or the Security Council cannot reach a unanimous decision on the issues they discuss is only because the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France have adopted an attitude that others cannot accept, and only because they have adopted an attitude that is incompatible with the sovereignty of independent countries, trying to force the Soviet Union to accept their decisions. They obviously refuse to consider such an indisputable prerequisite: unilateralism cannot work in international affairs, and such a method of handling affairs cannot guarantee cooperation between equal sovereign states. However, the United States, Britain, and France have precisely tried to exercise such a method, and the goals and intentions of their foreign policy are fundamentally different from the goals and intentions of Soviet foreign policy.

The U.S. Usurps the UN's Name to Invade China and is Trying to Conceal its New Acts of Aggression

If a decision that everyone agrees on is to be made within the various agencies of the United Nations, and the obstacles to reaching a decision are to be eliminated, it is necessary to strictly abide by a sacred rule—that all member states of the United Nations fulfill their obligations under the Charter and do not take any actions that violate the principles of the Charter, so as to avoid endangering international peace, security, and justice as a result.

We are criticizing "collective measures" in this way, and some people may object, and they may argue forcefully that all these measures are stipulated in the Charter, and that these measures are for fighting aggressors, and that these measures are aimed at countries that are considered to have aggressive actions.

Of course, the Charter does contain such measures, as we pointed out when we talked about Articles 43, 45, 46, and 47 of the Charter. But precisely because such measures have already been stipulated in the Charter, there is no need to recommend that the General Assembly approve these measures, and the Fourteen-Nation Committee has made such a recommendation.

Of course, the Charter stipulates measures for fighting against the aggressive actions of countries that endanger international peace and the security of all countries. But people must not forget this extremely important situation: the Charter stipulates a special procedure for implementing these measures, which guarantees the correctness and complete fairness of the resolution, because of which the actions of one country or another can be considered aggression, and that country itself can be declared an aggressor. In the report of the so-called "Collective Measures" Committee, there is no such guarantee, this procedure is ignored, and this procedure is even directly violated because the right and power of the Security Council to decide on the above-mentioned issues are transferred to the General Assembly, which the Charter has not granted such power.

We have had the painful experience of the General Assembly's illegal, unfounded, and extremely unjust resolutions on this issue. This is the unprecedented thing of declaring the People's Republic of China an aggressor, while the People's Republic of China itself is the victim of aggression by the United States and its allies!

These acts of aggression are still continuing.

Now the US command is transporting Kuomintang troops from Taiwan Island to Thailand and northern Burma, and is preparing large-scale military operations to invade the borders of the People's Republic of China, and is preparing to occupy certain countries. Facts show that this danger threatens Thailand and Burma. Some sources indicate that these are the measures taken by the United States to support the Kuomintang general Li Mi's bandit troops on the borders of Thailand, Burma, Vietnam, and Yunnan Province. From newspaper reports, it can be seen that the US Seventh Fleet is actively participating in the preparations for new acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China and other countries in this region.

Naturally, we remember that the armed intervention of the United States in North Korea has always been covered up, and is still being covered up today. It insists that this is some kind of aid from the US imperialists to the Syngman Rhee regime, and insists that the Syngman Rhee regime has been attacked from "North Korea". We can expect that such illegal and truly aggressive actions by the United States will also be casually called "defensive" measures against China's "aggression". All these facts fully demonstrate that whether the actions of one country or another are determined to be aggression is directly decided by the Atlantic state group headed by the United States; today, in the United Nations, this group decides on the issue of war and peace. These facts show that if the situation in the United Nations does not change, if, as in the past, the core of the Atlantic aggressive group continues to do whatever it wants in the General Assembly, then the matter of the General Assembly determining and declaring the truly defensive actions of certain countries as acts of aggression will still occur in the future. These facts also show that from now on, completely arbitrary and illegal means will be used in these matters. This explains why all the arguments that these so-called "collective measures" are for fighting against the aggressive actions of certain countries cannot convince anyone, cannot change the evaluation of these measures in the slightest, and cannot refute such an indisputable fact: these measures themselves are the product of aggressive policies, and their purpose is to implement this policy at the time and place that American monopolists consider advantageous and appropriate.

All these measures implemented by the Atlantic Group, although nominally the same as the measures stipulated by the Charter, now have a different nature because they are pursuing goals beyond the provisions of the United Nations Charter.

It would be easy to deny this fact, as long as one thing is done—re-respect the Charter, honestly and strictly fulfill all the requirements of the Charter, do not abolish a single point of the Charter, and do not slightly violate the smallest provision of the Charter. Everyone who truly strives for peace, everyone who truly takes it as his responsibility to oppose potential aggression, should do this. On the contrary, those who talk about peace to cover up their warmongering goals and aggressive purposes, to cover up their goals of conquest and aggression, those who pursue aggressive foreign policies, cannot and will not do this.

The U.S. Attempts to Turn the UN into a Tool of War; the Soviet Union Opposes This Step Towards War

In this regard, I would like to raise an important question. What intentions do the organizers of the Atlantic Group have in bringing their plans—those plans for indisputable aggressive measures that seriously violate the principles, purposes, and tasks of the Charter—to the United Nations General Assembly for approval?

One has to ask: Since the plans of the Atlantic Group have already been put into practice, since the signatory countries of this convention are already implementing this plan, and since the Atlantic Group already has the military executive agency and the army and all the other military means required by this plan, then why do the organizers and instigators of this group still need the United Nations General Assembly to approve this plan?

The report of the so-called "Collective Measures" Committee provides an answer to this question. Section 235 of this report points out the great significance of these measures, which determine the nature of future wars, in political, psychological, and spiritual aspects. This report points out that the army under the command of the military executive agency must be the army of the United Nations without compromise, and the commander-in-chief must command all battles in the capacity of the commander-in-chief of the United Nations army without compromise, and must issue all orders, reports, and instructions, and maintain liaison with all parties on behalf of the United Nations command. The report points out that it is very important to guarantee these points.

Section 236 of the report points out that the Security Council or the General Assembly must allow the use of the United Nations flag on the battlefield, and the commander-in-chief must pay attention to using both the national flag of the country concerned and the United Nations flag simultaneously when performing combat missions.

It can be seen from this that the purpose of these measures is to use the United Nations, an organization created to maintain peace, as a tool of war, and to use the name and flag of the United Nations to cover up the war manufactured according to the plans of the Atlantic aggressive group.

The leaders and organizers of the Atlantic Group believe that it is necessary at all costs to disguise their aggressive plans in order to deceive public opinion and make the people believe that the war they are preparing to launch is a war of self-defense, just as they now say that the wars against the people of Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and other countries, as well as the aggressive actions against the Chinese people, are wars of self-defense, so that they can make their soldiers believe that this extremely unjust cause is just, and to fight for them on the battlefield.

They believe in their hearts that the United Nations can be conveniently used by them, and that the principles of peace and international cooperation can be used to cover up the lawless behavior of the instigators of new wars.

This deception will of course be exposed, but these people hope to obtain the greatest benefits from this shameful thing, even at the expense of causing great pain and disaster to all mankind.

For the above reasons, the Soviet delegation believes that the conclusions of this report and the proposals of the eleven countries are absolutely unsatisfactory and absolutely harmful, and their harm to the cause of peace is no less than the resolution falsely called "United Action for Peace" on which the current proposal is based.

The Soviet delegation will vote against this proposal because this proposal is another step on the road to launching a new world war.

    关于美国的所谓“集体措施”计划—准备战争的计划
    ——维辛斯基一九五二年一月三日在联合国政治委员会上的发言全文（续完）
    如果抛开比喻不谈，那末，我们就只能这样来了解英国首相的这篇谈话，即他供认了英国的外交政策在遵循着错误的方针，这已使英国处于这样困难的地位。从邱吉尔演说中的下一段可以明显地看出是这样的，这一段说：英国面临着财政危机，需要作许多努力，邱吉尔说需要用“我们国家的全部力量”来阻止“走下坡路，并回到平地上来，然后我们必须从头努力干。”
    但是英国的情况是这样，它如何来努力呢？邱吉尔本人已说过：英国国库的收支若不能平衡，英国国家就可能面临破产，并会像邱吉尔所说的那样，“必须在乞讨施舍——如果我们能够获得的话——与挨饥受饿这两条道路中作一选择。”
    邱吉尔指出：英国面临另一种与一九四○年不同的危险。
    邱吉尔说：“不论就全国来说，不论就个人来说，我们不能永远入不敷出。除了盟国的防御和重整军备的工作以外，我们不能永远依靠美国的援助”……。他说：“我们决不能再请我们的帝国帮忙了。这一切都是冷酷的事实，而不是演说、社论、游说、投票等等所能改变的。事实还是事实。那末，从这一点可以看出什么呢？”邱吉尔继续说：“如果我们不能甚至更加紧发挥我们的力量、智慧和技艺来获得生存，那末，我们就没有机会得以安置国内粮食所不足以养活的几百万剩余人民，同时我们也没有把握说，别人会把英国狮子作为心爱的家畜来养活它。”
    这就是目前在英国由于扩张军备政策和军费负担不断增加而产生的情况。
    但是，正如邱吉尔先生本人承认的，英国所能指望美国给它的唯一援助，是关于继续扩张军备计划的援助，因为艾森豪威尔以及在他背后的不仅决定美国的外交政策的方向而且决定大西洋集团其他成员国的外交政策的方向的力量，是不允许缩小扩张军备计划的。
    大西洋集团阵营各大国间的矛盾愈来愈增长和尖锐化，阵营内部的困难在不断地增加。
    帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾日深美国图加紧武装西德作为盟友
    现在，谁都已经知道，舒曼计划固然是美国垄断资本企图用来控制若干西欧国家——法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡——的重工业的工具，然而它的用意还不仅止于此。据索邦大学教授拉维尔湼在他的一本著作“舒曼计划”中说，这个计划是针对英国的，并且用拉维尔涅教授的话来说，是“近一个半世纪以来所建立的对付‘没有信义的英国’的最危险的战争机器。”他还说：“由联营而建立的‘欧洲社会’实际上是一个永久的工业联盟，它的目标就是要把英国金属产品逐出一切出口市场。建立了这样的‘社会’之后，它的内部便可以就生产任务确立专业分工，这样就会大大地帮助它们在第三者国家的市场上打败英国工业。可是，舒曼计划既然不是别的，而只是我们六个国家对英国威力进行的一场有效的经济战争，这难道可能一点也不影响英国对我们的政策么？从今以后，我们应当准备在全世界遭到英国的坚决的敌意态度。”
    这就是大西洋公约的有利影响的结果。显然，这证明了英国和美国间的矛盾，证明了英国和法国间的矛盾以及它的一切后果，这是使帝国主义阵营四分五裂的矛盾。先生们，你们是应该从这里来寻找你们的困难的根源的。俄国有一句俗语说得好：“自己的尊容难看，别怪镜子不好。”
    英法关系便是这个样子。然而，事情还不止这样。大家都知道，舒曼计划得到美国的大力支持，就是因为这样，所以舒曼计划和普利文计划都被人家叫做美国计划，甚至欧洲谘询议会前主席斯巴克也这样说。美国认为，舒曼计划主要是在经济方面保证美国的地位的适当手段，而普利文计划则是在军事方面保证同样的地位的手段。这两个计划都是要保障美国垄断资本以及和它们勾结的西德垄断资本在西欧的统治地位的。
    舒曼计划和普利文计划两者事实上都会导致西德的重新军国主义化，这是和欧洲和平的利益不相容的，而且也受到德国人民的谴责，德国人民不愿被利用作实现别人的计划的工具，何况这种计划是追逐着侵略目标的呢。按照普利文计划，若干西欧国家将成立统一的军队，西德军队无疑将在其中居于优势的地位。同样地，根据舒曼计划，所谓“欧洲煤钢联营”组成之后，鲁尔的重工业便将和法国、比利时、意大利、荷兰和卢森堡的重工业联合起来，造成鲁尔工业巨头在西欧的武器和军需生产方面保持控制地位的条件。这又是符合于美国垄断资本家的意图的，他们曾经利用而且正在利用在西德的占领政权，牢牢地打入德国的托辣斯和卡特尔，并使它们愿意为实现他们的侵略计划而服务。
    可是，最近，建立要英国军队参加的“欧洲军”的计划遭到了英国的反抗，它拒绝参加这样的军队。这是邱吉尔在一九五一年十二月六日的议会演说中亲口说的。他说，英国并不打算参加欧洲军……。
    然而，英国对这问题的态度完全不合于美国军人的意旨，因为美国军人想连英国武装部队的控制权也拿过来。可是，美国遭到英国的抵抗，便愈加热中于重建德国国防军，想把它当作大西洋军队中的可靠盟友。为了这个缘故，美国在西德大力支持军国主义团体和新纳粹团体复活，这些团体招揽了大批贩卖复仇情绪的德国将领、军官、兵士和积极的纳粹分子。
    根据权威消息，西德盟国高级专员公署里的美国人已准备把这一切军国主义团体合并起来。一九五一年九月，八个德国将领在波恩举行了一次会议，美国副高级专员海斯少将也参加了，把西德军队建立成大西洋公约体系中的模范军队的计划就是他拟订的。
    参加这次会议的德国将领有：弗里斯纳，他现在是一个新纳粹团体的代理领袖；曼陀菲尔，公认的德国军国主义的代表；拉姆凯少将，希特勒伞兵部队的创立者，他原来因对人类所犯的罪行而被判刑囚禁在比利时，最近才在大赦的藉口下被释放的；此外还有空军将领斯图姆夫和史图登特。
    从同一消息来源得悉，一九五一年八月底，美国驻西德高级专员麦克洛埃曾说，只要大西洋联盟各机构决定武装西德，并宣布动员德国的“战斗部队”，统一的欧洲军里的西德武装部队在十八个月内就可以建立起来，并处于充分的准备状态。麦克洛埃证实，只要武装西德一事得到正式批准，美国便开始给西德以军事援助，纵然它还不是北大西洋公约的成员国。至于西德的军事生产问题，麦克洛埃说，西德可以为大西洋联盟的武装部队生产“轻型物资”、器械、仪器、电动机、电工器材和卡车等。
    在艾森豪威尔将军这一方面，他个人也是表示十分希望西德正规军复活的。十一月二十六日，他在罗马北大西洋联盟会议上直认不讳地说，美国无论在地理上或是在军事上，都需要德国的帮助，又说，如果美国能够利用德国的力量，继续组织欧洲军，美国就会较快地达到自己的目的。
    美英法侵略政策到处遭到反抗竟捏造卑鄙谎言来掩饰其罪行
    这些目的是什么呢？关于这些目的，是没有任何秘密的。这些目的是十分明白而确定的。这些目的是由美、英、法三国国内的侵略势力的政策决定的，这三国国内的侵略势力，正像一九五一年二月斯大林对“真理报”记者的谈话中所说的，是渴望新战争以谋得超额利润并劫掠其他国家的。难道在东方许多地方——朝鲜、越南、马来亚——没有战争的烈火已经在燃烧着吗？这些烈火，难道不是由殖民国家的侵略政策点燃起来的吗？——殖民国家正在力图用武力阻止已经觉醒过来要求过新生活的亚洲人民的民族解放运动。连殖民国家的代表们自己不是也不得不承认问题是如何维持他们的殖民主义的控制并保证使他们能够继续剥削与压迫别国人民吗？法国在印度支那的总司令塔西尼将军不是曾经公开地说法国在印度支那所做的和美国在朝鲜所做的是一件事，法国在亚洲所进行的战争不唯关乎印度支那的存在，而且关乎东南亚、甚至整个亚洲的存在吗？
    这位将军说：“丧失了东南亚，就会意味着共产主义将要获得主要的战略原料，日本的经济永久处于不均衡的状态，整个亚洲都将受到威胁。”
    关于共产主义和所谓笼罩着全亚洲的某种威胁的说法的特殊性质，是不必去揭露了。扯出共产主义的问题来，只是为了掩饰大西洋集团的侵略目的，只是为了欺骗各国的人民。
    英国在马来亚所追逐的目的、美法英三国共同在中东和近东所追逐的目的与美国在朝鲜和法国在越南所追逐的目的，都是一样的。在中东和近东，美、英、法三国集中力量来维持它们在这个地区各个国家中的控制地位，阻止中东和近东各国人民从外国压迫下解放出来，以便继续在这个地区的各国人民的贫穷和毁灭的基础上养肥自己；举例来说，从帝国主义国家在伊朗和埃及的行动上，就可以特别清楚地看出这一点。这一切，现在都正在被它们用一些虚伪的话掩饰起来，它们说，它们关心这个地区的各国人民的幸福，说它们的目标只有一个，就是：使这个地区的人民获得“自由”的生活，它们只是执行它们的“解放使命”；附带说一句，美国政府的拨款一亿美元以进行反对苏联和人民民主国家的颠覆恐怖活动的法律，也是这样伪善地说的。
    关于共产党情报局、“红色帝国主义”、“共产主义威胁”的演说也是同样虚妄的，艾奇逊先生和邱吉尔先生（如我所已提到的）近来都谈到这些事，并且他们大家——大西洋集团的领袖们——也都在这样谈。苏联人民的领袖斯大林远在一九三九年相似的情况下所说的具有卓见的话完全可以应用到这些虚妄的演说上，那时法西斯的罪魁——希特勒德国、法西斯的意大利和帝国主义的日本——正在建立它们的战争集团，它们的“轴心”，试图把事情说成好像是它们为反对共产国际和“共产主义威胁”而斗争一样。
    斯大林在当时说：“侵略者老爷们就是这样来笼络舆论的，虽然这明明是一套掩耳盗铃的愚蠢把戏；因为要在蒙古沙漠上，在阿比西尼亚丛山间，在西属摩洛哥的密林中去寻找共产国际的‘策源地’，是很可笑的。”
    美国的所谓“集体措施”计划破坏安理会五大国一致原则
    如果我们回头来谈“集体措施”委员会的报告，并且把这个报告来和联合国的原则、宗旨、任务比较一下，那末就可以很容易地看出：这个报告显然是完全不顾联合国宪章的原则、宗旨和任务的。
    首先使人感到惊异的是委员会成立具有特别广泛职权的军事执行机构的计划。这个机构负责指挥各个国家的活动并把交由它指挥的武装部队组织起来。任何国家，甚至不处在冲突地区的国家，都可能被任命为军事执行者。这里我必须顺便谈一谈，这就可以解释可敬的瑞典代表的疑惑了。他说：他不了解为什么“东方集团”（他这样称呼）的国家攻击大西洋集团的区域协定。正是因为它一点也不是区域协定，因为它没有界限——它伸延到太平洋和地中海并包括整个世界，所以才有人反对它。这是一种怎么样的区域协定呢？联合国宪章第五十一条和它有什么关系呢？这是对宪章和第五十一条的明显嘲笑。如报告中第二百零二节所指出的，这样的执行者可能只是邻近这个区域的国家，特别是如果这个国家的武装部队参加作战，……如果这个国家充分地运用了它的战争潜力的话。大家都知道美国正尽它的一切力量使这种军事机构的权力委托给它。美国政府力求把根据侵略性的大西洋公约的条款而驻扎在其他国家领土上的美国军队算入所谓“联合国武装部队”中，这也可以说明这一点。这些行动，充分地透露了美国政府利用委员会所提出的建议，以盗用联合国的名义来掩饰美国的侵略政策的真正意图。
    可是委员会的这个建议，严重地违背了联合国宪章。联合国宪章规定，在安全理事会的指导下进行活动的军事参谋团，是在反侵略的斗争中指挥军事行动的唯一机关。与安全理事会的决定相对峙的，是大会的决定；安全理事会有着常任理事国一致的原则来充分保证其所采取的决定是正确的这种规定，而大会的决定，是在没有联合国宪章为安全理事会所规定的保证的情况下采取的。安全理事会的决定，在这种情况下，是需要安全理事会全体常任理事国和至少两个非常任理事国的一致通过的。这的确是奠定我们的机构的基础的伟大原则所树立的真正保证，这个原则就是：在解决重大问题的时候，必须有安全理事会五大国的一致同意，如果在解决这种问题时会产生可能导致战争的重大决定的话。
    因此，我们说，把这种职权交给用简单多数或即使是三分之二的多数决定这种问题的大会，是根本没有任何意义的。我们已经看到这种三分之二的多数是怎样拼凑起来的，我们不幸从实际经验中明白了这一点。这并不是保卫和平防止战争的保证，因为把军事参谋团的权利交给大会，就像把安全理事会的权利交给大会以及把安全理事会的权利交给军事执行机构而不附之以联合国宪章和它的原则所树立的保证一样，并不是保障和平，而是一条危险的道路，或者用瑞典代表在这里所说的话，是“可能的战争危险”。
    美国代表在这里重述了莫洛托夫在旧金山所作的如下一段发言。莫洛托夫说：
    “只有当这种前提已经具备，而破坏和平的举动或破坏和平的威胁不会免除惩罚并且相当的惩治办法不会延误的时候，国际安全机构才能负起维持和平事业的责任。”
    我感谢美国代表引莫洛托夫的这一段重要谈话。礼尚往来，我也愿意追述一下当时美国国务卿斯退丁纽斯先生所说的一段话。斯退丁纽斯说，如果这些国家（他说的是安全理事会的常任理事国）之一一旦走上了侵略的道路，那结果不管安全理事会在会员国资格和表决程序上采取了什么决定，就会引起很大的战争。联合国宪章并没有使大国获得它们实际上未曾具有的任何权力，即便是没有联合国宪章，这些国家维持或破坏和平的权力，也早已存在了。斯退丁纽斯说，联合国宪章所作的只是把特别的、具有约束性的义务加在大国身上，这种义务要求它们共同而且和谐地为了和平去运用它们手中的权力，而不是片面地为了战争去运用这种权力。
    一九四五年六月七日旧金山四国声明说：因此，为了使安全理事会可能用多数表决的办法来通过决议，唯一可实行的办法是规定关于非程序问题的决议需要常任理事国的一致赞成，再加上至少两个非常任理事国的同意票。
    这个声明又指出：安全理事会的决议和行动可能产生重大的政治后果并且甚至可能引起一连串的事件，这些事件最后可能需要安全理事会来履行它的职责，采取强制措施。
    这是符合于联合国宪章第七章的。
    声明继续说：当安全理事会决定进行调查，或者认为时机已到可以要求各国解决它们的……纠纷，或者向各国提出建议时，这就是这一连串的事件开始的时候。
    由上面看来，关于断定一个国家或另一个国家的行动是否侵略行动由谁来采取决定和如何采取决定，以及关于反对侵略的斗争由谁来采取决定和如何采取决定的问题，无论就原则或实际应用上来说，都是具有重大意义的。把这个权利交给安全理事会，并规定安全理事会在决定非程序问题时必须遵守五个常任理事国一致的基本原则，这就是非常重要的保证，保证在决定与确保国际和平与安全的措施有关的问题时能够保持客观和公正。单是这种情形就足以使我们看出：悍然违反了联合国宪章主要原则的委员会的建议是完全不能接受的。这种情形是违反宪章的，因为把这种权力和它的一切保证、属于安全理事会的这种权利和它的一切保证、安全理事会的这些权力，都移交给大会，移交给所谓军事执行机构，也就是说，只交给一个国家，交给艾森豪威尔，交给布莱德雷，他们是军人，自然将按照他们自己的办法行事，法国有句老话说：“卖什么的，就叫喊什么。”
    这是严重地违反了宪章的原则的。像柯亨先生这样的法律专家能够说出“集体措施”是完全符合于宪章的这样的话来，我们就不能不觉得奇怪。
    安理会对问题不能有一致决定是由于美英法的独断独行态度
    可是，违反宪章的还不只是这一点。我们可以说：整个报告中的每一项建议都是严重地违反了宪章。
    如果需要证据的话，人们可以看一看第二章，这一章论到政治性的集体措施。从这一章的条文中就很容易看到：授权大会决定断绝外交关系的建议就是完全违反宪章的，因为根据宪章第四十一条，这种权利完全是属于安全理事会的职权范围以内的。关于实行禁运和贸易（包括出口和进口）的全部或部分的封锁、禁止某些或全部的金融业务、禁止私人接触和扣押存款或财产等经济措施，也应该说同样是违反宪章的。同样，这一切以宪章第四十一条和四十二条为根据的措施，也只有安全理事会才有权采取。
    这里也必须提醒一下，宪章第四十六条和四十七条规定了军事参谋团的职责。这两条规定，参谋团设在安全理事会之下，负责对任何提交安理会支配的军队作战略指挥。然而，这些职权现在却转交给军事执行机构，这是明目张胆地破坏宪章的行为。
    这个报告的第四章第二部分“军事措施”提到了“保障和平的联合行动”决议案，这个决议案建议联合国每一个会员国都从自己的武装部队中抽调出一部分部队来，加以训练、组织和装备，以便在安全理事会或大会提出建议时，可以马上用来充当联合国的战斗部队。把这样的权力给予联合国大会，也是违反宪章规定的，宪章第七章把这些权力赋与安全理事会，而且仅只赋与这一个机构。根据宪章第四十三条，如果为了维持国际和平而需要某一个国家的军队，必须由安全理事会根据关于这个问题的特别协定向该国提出要求，并使这些军队归安理会调度，其他机构是没有这种权力的。
    宪章第四十五条规定，那一个国家应该准备多少，国际联合制裁行动所需要的空军部队，这些空军部队应该处于什么程度的准备状态，都应该由安全理事会在军事参谋团的协助之下决定。
    从这一切方面来看，要建立某种具有非凡权力的军事执行机构，无论如何是没有理由的。这样的机构原来就已经建立了——这便是军事参谋团；这样的权力原来就已经存在了——这便是联合国宪章第七章。所谓“集体措施”委员会的报告在这个问题上所说到的一切，都不能由安理会以外的其他任何机构实行，而只能由安理会通过决定才能实行。如果把这样的权力赋与任何其他按照前年联合国大会的决议或大会任何其他决议而设立的机构，便是严重地破坏了宪章，是一种蛮不讲理的行动，是篡夺了属于安全理事会而且仅能属于安全理事会的权力。这样的“集体措施”破坏了整个宪章，破坏了宪章的根本精神。
    宪章的这一切条文就被所谓“集体措施”委员会这样轻易地抛弃掉，而换上了它的报告中的规定。
    为了替这些非法的措施辩解：“集体措施”委员会的报告说，在联合国宪章第四十三条所规定的协定还没有缔结之前，联合国大会力求保证它的武装力量。
    但是，美、英、法三国政府一方面采取这样的步骤，另一方面却没有设法去真正缔结第四十三条所规定的协定，显然它们是要在这问题上利用由于它们自身的错误态度而造成的情况，来达到它们的非法目的。这难道不是人人都可以清楚地看到的吗？
    应该提醒委员会：第五届联合国大会所通过的向安全理事会提出的建议，还没有执行；那个建议要安全理事会拟订尽早施行联合国宪章第四十三、四十五、四十六、四十七等各条所规定的措施——这几条是规定联合国会员国把自己的军队置于安全理事会的指挥之下，规定军事参谋团有效地履行职务的。美英集团根本没有动手执行这个决议，那显然正是因为实施这个决议，会使一切这种所谓“集体措施”和军事执行机构及其非法活动失去依据而全部垮台。
    这是根本不奇怪的，因为美国政府是绝对不关心这个决定的实施的。请注意，美国代表柯亨先生昨天直率地说：在时机到来而且联合国宪章第四十三条可以付诸实行的时候，联合国策划集体行动和制订安全制度的经验是可能对宪章这一条的实施有帮助的。
    这一段话表明：美国政府并不认为施行第四十三条的时机已经到来。甚至连这种时机什么时候到来，究竟还来不来，也还不知道。人们如果从美国政府在这方面的行动看来，就可以断定：这种时机是不会到来的了。毫无疑问，第四十三条，就像联合国宪章中和我们所谈的问题有关的其他各条一样，就像联合国宪章本身一样，都在很久以前就被美英集团搁置起来了。只有在隆重的场合，只有在需要引用宪章来掩饰违背宪章的非法行动的时候，才想起宪章来，其目的是用这种方法欺骗舆论，以便达到直接与宪章上所载的宗旨相抵触的它们的目的。
    为了使人们了解上述的意见是公正的，还应该提起军事参谋团在它的工作——拟订联合国武装部队的组织计划——中所遭到的困难。
    有人说，军事参谋团和安全理事会因为能力不够，所以不能产生积极的成果，而它们所以没有能力又是苏联代表的顽固态度所造成的。这种说法是完全没有根据的。
    事实上，军事参谋团或安全理事会之所以不能就它们讨论的问题取得一致的决定，只是因为美、英、法三国代表采取了别人绝对不能接受的态度，只是因为他们采取了与独立国家的主权不相容的态度，企图强使苏联接受他们的决定。他们显然拒绝考虑到这样一个无可置辩的前提，就是：一国独断独行在国际事务上是行不通的，这样的办事手段不能保证平等的主权国家间的合作。但是，美、英、法三国恰恰是曾经企图行使这样的方法，他们的外交政策的目标和意图和苏联外交政策的目标和意图是有原则上的区别的。
    美国盗用联合国名义侵略中国并正力图掩饰它的新侵略行动
    如果要在联合国各机构内作出大家同意的决定，要消除达成决定的障碍，就必须严格地遵守一条神圣的规则——联合国各会员国履行它依据宪章所承担的义务，不采取一切违反宪章原则的行动，以免因此危及国际和平、安全和正义。
    我们这样批评“集体措施”，也许有人要反对，他们也许会振振有辞地说，这一切措施都是宪章里规定的，这些措施是为了对侵略者进行斗争的，又说这些措施是针对那些被认为有侵略行动的国家的。
    当然，宪章的确包含这种措施，正如我们在谈到宪章第四十三条、第四十五条、第四十六条和第四十七条时所指出的。但是正是由于这种措施已经在宪章中规定下来了，所以没有必要建议大会批准这些措施，而十四国委员会竟提出了这样的建议。
    当然，宪章规定了关于对那些危害国际和平及各国安全的国家的侵略行动进行斗争的措施。但是人们一定不要忘记这种极端重要的情况：宪章规定了实施这些措施的特别程序，这种程序保证了决议的正确与完全公正，由于这种决议，一个国家或另一个国家的行动就可以被认为是侵略，那个国家本身也就可以被宣布为侵略者。在所谓“集体措施”委员会的报告中，没有这种保证，这种程序被忽略了，而且由于要把安全理事会关于决定上述问题的权利和权力移交给宪章并未授予这种权力的大会，这种程序甚至直接被违反了。
    我们已经有过大会在这种问题上的非法的、毫无根据的、极为不公正的决议的惨痛经验。这就是宣布中华人民共和国为侵略者这件向来没有听说过的事情，同时，中华人民共和国本身却是美国和它的盟友的侵略的受难者！
    这些侵略行动还在继续进行。
    现在美国司令部正在把国民党军队从台湾岛运到泰国和缅甸北部，正在准备大规模的军事行动，来侵犯中华人民共和国的边疆，正在准备占领某些国家。事实表明：这种危险威胁着泰国和缅甸。有些消息说明：这就是美国所采取的措施，这些措施目的在于支持泰国、缅甸、越南和云南省边境上的国民党的将领李弥的匪军。从报纸消息可以看出：美国第七舰队正在积极参加对中华人民共和国和这个区域的其他国家进行新的侵略行动的准备工作。
    自然，我们记得，美国对北朝鲜的武装干涉也是一直被掩盖起来的，而且直到今天还是被掩盖着，它硬说这是美帝国主义者对李承晚政权的什么援助，硬说李承晚政权受到从“北朝鲜”来的攻击。我们可以预料得到：美国这样一类非法的、真正侵略的行动，也将随便地被称为对中国“侵略”的“防御”措施。这一切事实充分证明：断定一个国家或另一个国家的行动是否为侵略，都是直接由以美国为首的大西洋国家集团来决定的；今日在联合国中，这个集团决定着战争与和平的问题。这些事实表明：如果联合国的情况不改变，如果和过去一样，大西洋侵略集团的核心继续在大会中随心所欲，那末，大会断定与宣布某些国家的真正防御行动为侵略行动的事，将来还会发生。这些事实还表明：从此以后，在这些问题上，将会使用完全专横和非法的手段。这就说明为什么关于这些所谓“集体措施”是为了对某些国家的侵略行动进行斗争的所有言论，都不能使任何人相信，都不能丝毫改变对这些措施的估价，都不能驳倒这样一个无可置辩的事实：这些措施本身就是侵略政策的产物，它们的目的是在美国垄断资本家认为有利与适宜的时间和地点实行这个政策。
    大西洋集团所实行的这一切措施，虽然名义都和宪章所规定的措施一样，可是现在已具有了另一种性质，因为它们追求着联合国宪章的规定以外的目标。
    要想否认这件事实倒很容易，那只要办到一件事——重新尊重宪章，诚实而严格地履行宪章的一切要求，不取消宪章规定的一分一毫，不稍为违反宪章的微小规定。一切真正为和平而努力，一切真正以反对潜在的侵略为己任的人，都应该这样做。反之，那些空谈和平来掩盖自己的好战目标和侵略目的、掩盖征服和侵略目标的人，那些奉行侵略外交政策的人，都不能而且也不会这样做。
    美国图将联合国当作战争工具苏联反对这一走向战争的步骤
    在这方面，我要提出一个重要的问题。大西洋集团的组织者把他们的计划——他们那些严重地违反宪章的原则、宗旨和任务的无可置辩的侵略措施计划，在联合国大会提出来，请求批准，到底是怀着什么用意的？
    人们要问：大西洋集团的计划既然已经付诸实行，既然这个公约的签字国都已在执行这计划，既然大西洋集团已经拥有了军事执行机构和军队以及这个计划所需要的其他一切军事手段，那么这个集团的组织者和主使者为什么还需要联合国大会批准这计划呢？
    所谓“集体措施”委员会的报告对这问题提供了答案。这个报告第二百三十五节指明了这些决定未来的战争的性质的措施在政治、心理和精神方面的巨大意义。这个报告指出，在军事执行机构指挥下的军队必须不折不扣地是联合国的军队，总司令必须不折不扣地以联合国军队总司令的资格指挥一切战役，必须由他发出一切命令、报告和指示，并代表联合国司令部与各方保持联络。报告指出，保证这几点是非常重要的。
    报告第二百三十六节指出，安全理事会或大会必须允许在战场上使用联合国旗帜，总司令必须注意在执行作战任务时同时使用当事国的国旗和联合国旗。
    由此可见，这些措施目的在于把联合国这个为了维持和平而创立的机构用来作为战争工具，用联合国的名义和旗帜来掩盖按照大西洋侵略集团的计划制造的战争。
    大西洋集团的领袖和组织者认为，必须不惜一切代价来伪装他们的侵略计划，以欺骗舆论，使人民相信他们正在准备发动的战争是一个自卫性质的战争，如他们现在把对朝鲜、越南、马来亚及其他国家人民的战事以及对中国人民的侵略行动说成是自卫性质的战争一样，以便他们能够叫他们的士兵相信这个极不正义的事业是正义的，而替他们上战场卖命。
    他们心目中以为，联合国可以很方便地被他们利用，可以用和平及国际合作的原则来掩盖新战争挑拨者的无法无天的行为。
    这个骗局当然会被拆穿的，可是这些人却希望从这件可耻的事情中取得最大的利益，甚至不惜使全人类受到极大的痛苦和灾难。
    基于上述理由，苏联代表团认为，这个报告的结论以及十一国的提案是绝对不能令人满意的，而且是绝对有害的，它们对和平事业的危害程度，并不下于作为目前提案的根据的伪称为“保障和平的联合行动”的决议案。
    苏联代表团将投票反对这个提案，因为这个提案是在发动新的世界大战的道路上的又一个步骤。
