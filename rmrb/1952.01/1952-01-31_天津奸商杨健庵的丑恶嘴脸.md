The profiteer Yang Jian'an, manager of the Tianjin private Huayang Tobacco Company, has been arrested by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government. Since liberation, Yang Jian'an has received care and assistance from the People's Government in both economic and political aspects. In the early days of liberation, when tobacco leaves were scarce, state-owned trading companies tried every means to supply tobacco leaves to Huayang Tobacco Company, enabling the company to maintain production. In the first half of 1950, when cigarettes were temporarily slow-selling, the Tianjin Department Store purchased a large quantity of the company's products, which helped Huayang Tobacco Company solve its working capital difficulties. Before liberation, Huayang Tobacco Company was a dilapidated small factory, producing at most ten boxes of cigarettes a day. After liberation, the factory's production increased nearly five times compared with before liberation, now averaging more than fifty boxes of cigarettes per day. Before his arrest, Yang Jian'an served as a member of the Tianjin Municipal Consultative Committee, a standing committee member of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the chairman of the Tianjin Tobacco Industry Association. In May 1950, he was also invited to participate in the Second National Tax Conference, participating in the discussion and revision of tax laws as the chief representative of Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles.

However, Yang Jian'an actually regarded the care and support of the People's Government as capital for attacking the state. He was a master of tax evasion, using his familiarity with tax laws to devise various ways to evade national taxes. The amount of tax he evaded was at least 2.3 billion yuan or more. He had as many as seven or eight methods of tax evasion. For example:
	(1) Exploiting loopholes in tax laws. Tax laws stipulate that if the sales price fluctuates by no more than 10 percent, the original tax amount will not change. Yang Jian'an cunningly exploited this loophole. After paying taxes at a low price, he immediately raised the price (no more than 10 percent) for sale; or before paying taxes, he suddenly lowered the selling price to pay taxes at a low price, and then raised the price for sale. For example, on December 13, 1950, he lowered the price of Héfēng brand cigarettes from 4.87 million yuan per box to 4.2 million yuan, selling 34 boxes; he lowered the price of pipe tobacco from 5 million yuan per box to 4.5 million yuan, selling 15 boxes. By using this method, he lowered the market price, and the tax bureau reduced the tax amount on the 16th according to the proportion of the price reduction. Huayang Tobacco Company paid taxes on 100 boxes each of Héfēng cigarettes and pipe tobacco according to the new tax amount, and immediately raised the price of Héfēng cigarettes to 4.725 million yuan per box and pipe tobacco to 4.875 million yuan per box, selling 81 boxes each. This one instance alone evaded 58.3 million yuan in taxes. Yang Jian'an used this method three times, evading a total of 207.6 million yuan in taxes.
	(2) Deceiving the state and evading business tax and income tax. According to Huayang Tobacco Company's declaration, the company's book profit in the first half of 1950 was 457,058,383 yuan. However, Yang Jian'an said that if calculated at the real value, the company would lose more than 1.2 billion yuan in this half year. In the second half of 1950, he similarly calculated profits as losses. Yang Jian'an clearly knew the principle of calculating and collecting taxes in currency, but he used the method of calculating at real value to deceive the state. As a result of this real value calculation, Huayang Tobacco Company evaded a total of 798 million yuan in business tax and income tax throughout 1950.
	(3) Hiding a large amount of off-book funds. The capitalist Chen Zihe, posing as the Shenyang Taiyang Tobacco Company, deposited a large amount of funds in Huayang Tobacco Company, opening a current account in the company's books to engage in commerce and evade business tax. Chen Zihe used this money to buy paper, tobacco leaves, and local tobacco worth a total of 5.9 billion yuan and sold them to Huayang Tobacco Company. In the transaction, neither commercial tax was paid nor invoices were issued, evading a total of 312.7 million yuan in commercial tax and stamp duty. Chen Zihe also deposited part of the sales proceeds in Huayang Tobacco Company as working capital in the name of Taiyang Tobacco Company, and "Huayang" calculated and guaranteed the principal according to the real value method. They evaded funds off-book, causing Huayang Tobacco Company to evade 960 million yuan in income tax in 1950.
	(4) Inflating expenses and evading income tax. At the end of 1950, Huayang Tobacco Company purchased 240,000 kilograms of tobacco leaves from other places. They transferred part of the tax expenses (a total of 291.3 million yuan) to the expense account of 1951, attempting to evade 87.39 million yuan in income tax in 1951.
	(5) Using old tax stamps. In order to evade taxes, Yang Jian'an even bought back a large number of used tax stamps from cigarette boxes and re-applied them. When the tax bureau sent someone to question him, Ran Xianyuan, the employee in charge of this matter in the company, stubbornly refused to admit it. The inspectors pointed to him and said: "The old tax stamps you have are in the second drawer of your desk. Please take them out." Only then did Ran Xianyuan flusteredly take out a package of old tax stamps wrapped in oil paper.

In addition, Yang Jian'an also used despicable methods such as not issuing invoices for sales, harboring merchants, and not reporting taxes for buying and selling goods on behalf of others to evade national taxes. He also illegally resold 107 taels of gold. In order to evade taxes and steal state property, he constantly bribed tax bureau and grassroots trade union cadres.

During the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-theft of state property movement in the industrial and commercial circles, Yang Jian'an, despite repeated persuasion and mobilization, still refused to thoroughly confess his crimes. The entire Tianjin Municipal Consultative Committee has unanimously approved the removal of his position as a member of the Consultative Committee, and the People's Court has arrested him and brought him to justice.

    天津奸商杨健庵的丑恶嘴脸
    林沫
    已被天津市人民政府逮捕的奸商杨健庵，是天津私营华阳烟草公司的经理。解放以来，杨健庵不论在经济上和政治上，都得到了人民政府的照顾和帮助。解放初期，烟叶缺乏，国营贸易公司曾想尽一切办法，供给华阳烟草公司烟叶，使这个公司能维持生产。一九五○年上半年，纸烟一度滞销，天津市百货公司曾大量收购这个公司的产品，结果，帮助华阳烟草公司解决了资金周转的困难。解放以前，华阳烟草公司原是一个破烂不堪的小厂子，一天最多不过出十来箱烟。解放以后，这个厂的生产较解放前提高将近五倍，现在平均日产卷烟五十多箱。杨健庵在被逮捕以前，担任着天津市协商委员会的委员、天津市工商业联合会常务委员、天津市烟草工业同业公会主任委员。一九五○年五月，他并被邀参加第二届全国税务会议，以天津市工商界首席代表的资格，参加讨论和修改税法的工作。
    但是，杨健庵竟把人民政府对他的照顾和扶助，作为向国家进攻的资本。他是一个偷税的能手，他利用熟悉税法的条件，想尽各种办法，偷漏国家税款。他偷漏的税款最少在二十三亿元以上。他偷税的方法有七、八种之多。例如：
        （一）钻税法的空子。税法上规定，售货价格涨落不超过百分之十，原税额即不再变动。杨健庵就狡猾地钻了这个空子。他按低价完税后，立即提高价格（不超过百分之十）出售；或者在完税前突然压低售价，以低价完税，再提高价格出售。比如在一九五○年十二月十三日，他把和风牌卷烟由每箱四百八十七万元压低到四百二十万元，售货三十四箱；把烟斗烟由每箱五百万元压低到四百五十万元，售货十五箱。他用这种方法，压低了市价，税务局即在十六日按照落价的比例，调低了税额。华阳烟草公司按新税额把和风烟、烟斗烟各完税一百箱，立即把和风烟提高到每箱四百七十二万五千元，烟斗烟提高到每箱四百八十七万五千元，各出售八十一箱。这一次就偷漏税款五千八百三十万元。杨健庵前后用这样的办法，共偷税三次，偷漏税款二亿零七百六十余万元。
        （二）欺骗国家，偷漏营业税、所得税。据华阳烟草公司申报，一九五○年上半年，该公司账面纯益共四亿五千七百零五万八千三百八十三元。但杨健庵说，如按折实计算，这半年要亏损十二亿元以上。一九五○年下半年，他同样把盈余算成亏损。杨健庵明明知道按货币计算和按货币征收的原则，却用折实计算的办法欺骗国家。这样折实计算的结果，华阳烟草公司在一九五○年全年偷漏营业税、所得税共七亿九千八百余万元。
        （三）隐藏大批账外资金。资本家陈子和假冒沈阳太阳烟草公司的名义，曾把大批资金存放在华阳烟草公司，在该公司账上开成来往户，经营行商，偷漏营业税。陈子和用这笔款买进总值五十九亿元的盘纸、烟叶、土烟，卖给华阳烟草公司。在交易中间，既不上临商税，也不开发货票，共偷漏临商税、印花税三亿一千二百七十万元。陈子和并把售货所得款项一部，冒太阳烟草公司的名义，存在华阳烟草公司作流动资金，并由“华阳”按折实办法，计值保本。他们把资金逃避在账外，使华阳烟草公司在一九五○年偷漏所得税九亿六千万元。
        （四）加报开支，偷漏所得税。华阳烟草公司在一九五○年底由外埠购进烟叶二十四万公斤，他们把其中一部分的税款开支（共二亿九千一百三十万元），移到一九五一年的开支账上，企图偷漏一九五一年所得税八千七百三十九万元。
        （五）使用旧查验证。杨健庵为着偷税，甚至大批买回卷烟盒上已经贴用过的查验证，再次贴用。当税务局派人去质问的时候，该公司经管这件事的职员冉宪元还坚不承认。检查人员指给他说：“你收藏的旧查验证就在你办公桌的第二个抽屉里，请你拿出来好了。”冉宪元才狼狈地拿出用油纸包裹着的一包旧查验证。
    此外，杨健庵还以销货不开发货票、包庇行商、代人买卖货物不报税等卑鄙办法，偷漏国税。他还非法倒卖黄金一百零七两。他为了偷漏税款，盗窃国家财产，曾不断贿赂税局和基层工会干部。
    杨健庵在工商界反行贿、反偷税、反对盗窃国家财产的运动中，虽经多次说服动员，但始终不肯彻底坦白自己的罪恶。天津市协商委员会全体委员已
    一致通过革除他的协商委员的职务，并由人民法院予以逮捕法办。
