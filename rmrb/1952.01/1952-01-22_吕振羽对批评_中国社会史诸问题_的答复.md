    Lü Zhenyu's Reply to Criticism of "Problems in Chinese Social History"

    Editor: The opinions of Comrade Yi Hua, a reader, published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on November 7, 1951, regarding my book "Problems in Chinese Social History," written in 1940, are completely correct. I sincerely thank him.

    However, the "Editor's Note: According to a letter from Gengyun Publishing House, the publishing house has handed over the book 'Problems in Chinese Social History' to the author for revision before continuing publication" does not correspond with the facts. In July 1949, when I arrived in Wuhan, I saw this book of mine published by Gengyun Publishing House and revised the entire book. I entrusted the revised manuscript to Comrade Deng Yanru, who is now working in the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to be handed over to Mr. Huang Baoxin, the person in charge of Gengyun. In April 1950, when I saw the newly released book in Dalian, it was still not the revised version. I wrote to Mr. Huang Baoxin, asking him to immediately stop issuing it and inquiring why it had not been typeset according to the revised manuscript. Mr. Huang replied, agreeing to stop issuing it and claiming that he had not received the revised manuscript.　Lü Zhenyu

    吕振羽对批评“中国社会史诸问题”的答复
    编辑同志：一九五一年十一月七日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载的读者义华同志对我一九四○年所著“中国社会史诸问题”的意见，是完全正确的，我诚恳地向他致谢。
    但“编者按：据耕耘出版社来信称，该社已将‘中国社会史诸问题’一书交由作者修正后再继续出版”，则和事实有出入。一九四九年七月，我到武汉，见到由耕耘出版社出版的这本拙著，就对全书加以修改，并把修改稿本托现在中共湖南省委工作的邓晏如同志转交耕耘负责人黄宝新先生。一九五○年四月，我在大连见到新发行的本书仍非修改本，就写信请黄宝新先生立刻停止发行，同时询问为什么没有按修改本付排。黄先生回信同意停止发行，并声称没有接到修改稿本。　吕振羽
