Xinhua News Agency report: In recent days, Northeast China has been mobilizing the masses from top to bottom and from inside to outside to continue to deepen the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

In the in-depth struggle, the movement has been relaunched vigorously in units where leading cadres first cleared the influence of bourgeois ideology and made demonstration reports at mass meetings. For example, the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government spent three days concentrating on checking the heads of departments, bureaus, and sections, as well as managers of district companies, and uncovered problems that had not been exposed in the previous stage. Many units resolutely dismissed leading cadres who hindered the movement and suppressed democracy, and promptly handled a number of corruption cases that had been clarified, so that the masses could see the policies clearly, give full play to their enthusiasm, and dare to confess and report. After Qi Guang, deputy director of the Monopoly Bureau of the Finance Department of the Northeast People's Government, was suspended for reflection for suppressing democracy, cadres above the section level of the bureau held meetings for days to conduct mutual criticism, and took the lead in making self-criticisms at two mass meetings, so the masses also generally took action. Many units announced the handling of corrupt elements whose facts had been clarified at mobilization meetings, which also motivated some people with lighter circumstances who had confessed but were waiting for handling and were taking a wait-and-see attitude.

In the in-depth inspection, all units criticized the right-leaning ideologies in the implementation of policies in the past due to the erosion of bourgeois thought. The Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government criticized some cadres for not actively overcoming difficulties to expand retail sales and strengthen state-owned trade, but only seeking easy shortcuts. The Dalian Coal Mining Construction Materials Company sold all its coke to private merchants, allowing them to control the market. Some state-owned stores did not actively promote the products of public factories, but only sold the so-called "famous brands" of private factories. The Shenyang Department Store adopted a laissez-faire attitude in processing orders to private factories, and did not intervene in the private merchants' cutting corners. These errors were all criticized in this inspection.

At present, units where the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has been carried out more thoroughly have sent a large number of cadres to go deep into grassroots units to help carry out the movement. The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government has transferred more than 1,000 cadres to form work groups, led by bureau and section chiefs, to go deep into factories and mines for inspection. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shenyang Municipal People's Government have sent eight work teams to carry out the struggle against bribery and tax evasion in private enterprises. Some units were eager to organize cadres to go down before the leading cadres had made a thorough self-criticism, which was severely criticized by the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This practice is essentially an attempt by leading cadres to evade the movement and muddle through. To this end, the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided that all leaders of all units, who have not made honest self-criticisms to their subordinates, should conduct one without exception. Leading cadres who have already gone down to inspect work should also make up for this lesson after returning, and must not let big corrupt officials escape.

    东北区反贪污斗争重新猛烈展开
    严厉批判受资产阶级思想侵蚀所产生的右倾思想
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：东北各地连日来正从上到下、从内到外发动群众，继续深入开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。
    在深入斗争中，凡是领导干部首先清算资产阶级思想的影响，并在群众大会上作示范报告的单位，运动都重新猛烈展开。如东北人民政府贸易部以三天时间集中部、局、处长和各区公司经理进行检查，又揭发了前一阶段还没有暴露的问题。很多单位对阻碍运动、压制民主的领导干部坚决撤职，对一批已经弄清事实的贪污案件及时处理，这样就使群众看清了政策，发挥了积极性，勇于坦白和检举。东北人民政府财政部令压制民主的专卖局副局长齐光停职反省后，该局科长以上干部连日开会相互展开批评，还在两次群众大会上带头进行检讨，因此群众也普遍行动起来。很多单位在动员会上宣布了对已弄清事实的贪污分子的处理，使一些情节较轻、坦白后因等待处理而观望的人也积极起来。
    各单位在深入检查中，批判了过去由于受资产阶级思想侵蚀以致在执行政策上所产生的右倾思想。东北人民政府贸易部批判了若干干部不积极克服困难扩大零售、壮大国营贸易，而只贪图省事的偏向。大连煤业建筑器材公司把焦炭全部卖给私商，让私商控制了市场。有些国营商店不积极推销公营工厂的产品，只卖私营工厂的所谓“名牌货”。沈阳市百货公司在向私营工厂加工定货中采取自由主义态度，对私商的偷工减料行为不加过问。这些错误也都在这次检查中一一受到了批判。
    目前反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争进行得较深入的单位，都已派出大批干部深入基层单位去帮助开展运动。东北人民政府工业部已抽调一千多名干部组成工作组，由局、处长领导深入各厂、矿检查。中共沈阳市委员会和沈阳市人民政府已派出八个工作队，开展私营企业中的反行贿、反偷税斗争。有些单位在领导干部还未作彻底检查以前就急于组织干部下去，受到了中共中央东北局的严厉批评。这种做法，实质上是领导干部企图躲避运动，蒙混“过关”。为此，中共中央东北局决定：一切单位的领导人员，凡是没有向所属人员进行过诚实的检讨的，应该无例外地进行一次，现在已经下去检查工作的领导干部，回来以后也要补上这一课，务必不使大贪污犯漏网。
