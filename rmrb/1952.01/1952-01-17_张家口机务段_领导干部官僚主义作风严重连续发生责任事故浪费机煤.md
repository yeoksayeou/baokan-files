To the Editor: The bureaucratic work style of leading cadres at the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot has caused great losses to the country. Since July 1950, the depot has had ten responsibility accidents, seven of which were signal overrun accidents. The continuous occurrence of signal overrun accidents is due to the fact that the traffic control cadres give consideration to personal feelings and lack serious and conscientious inspection, as well as insufficient education of the train dispatchers.

    The phenomenon of wasting coal at this depot is also very serious. Leading cadres sent a research group to study this matter, and the research group also made a summary report at the train crew meeting, and everyone put forward some suggestions for revision. However, the leading cadres do not organize the train crews to study, nor do they accept the revised opinions, so the waste of coal is even more serious. For example, in late November of last year, 93 tons of coal were wasted.

    The economic accounting work of the locomotive depot is very poor. For example, the production and financial plan stipulates that the cost of tools and other expenses for the third and fourth quarters is more than 17 million yuan, but more than 18 million yuan was spent in September alone.

    Leading cadres do not pay attention to workers' rationalization proposals. To date, workers have put forward 116 rationalization proposals, of which 46 have yielded no results. Recently, the personnel of the depot's rationalization proposal committee have even discovered that many rationalization proposal documents have been lost. Since the locomotive depot launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy, workers have put forward specific measures to overcome waste. Up to now, the leading cadres have not yet dealt with them.

### 张家口机务段  领导干部官僚主义作风严重连续发生责任事故浪费机煤

    张家口机务段
    领导干部官僚主义作风严重连续发生责任事故浪费机煤
    编辑同志：张家口机务段领导干部的官僚主义作风，给国家造成很大损失。机务段自一九五○年七月到现在，已发生十件责任事故，其中有七件是冒进信号事故。连续发生冒进信号事故的原因，是行车领导干部顾全情面，缺乏严肃的和认真的检查，以及对车务员的教育不够。这个段浪费机煤的现象也很严重。领导干部派研究组研究了这件事，研究组也在乘务员会议上作了总结报告，大家也提了几点修改意见。但领导干部不组织乘务员学习，也不接受修改的意见，因而机煤浪费情况更严重了。例如，去年十一月下旬，就浪费了九十三吨煤。机务段的经济核算工作做得很差，如生产财务计划中规定，第三季度和第四季度的工具等费用为一千七百多万元，但只九月份就花了一千八百多万元。领导干部不重视工人的合理化建议。到现在止，工人已提出一百十六件合理化建议，其中有四十六件毫无结果。最近，段里合理化建议委员会的人员更发现很多件合理化建议的文件被遗失了。机务段开展增产节约运动后，工人曾提出克服浪费的具体办法，直到现在，领导干部还没有处理。
