    China Native Produce Company Suzhou Branch
    Leading Cadres Waste and Neglect Duties
    Comrade Editor: Leading cadres of the Suzhou Branch of the China Native Produce Company have serious bureaucracy and extravagance. In business, leading cadres take over everything, and section chiefs and unit chiefs feel they have authority in name only, unable to give full play to their work enthusiasm, resulting in continuous mold, shortages of materials, and other waste of state property. For example, in the summer of 1951, the company allocated 50,000 dan of Northeast soybean cakes. Because there was no plan in advance, they were transported from the Taicang Office to the Kunshan Office, then from the Kunshan Office to the Suzhou Branch, and finally to the Wuxian Office, creating a "grand tour" for the materials. According to statistics, the loading and unloading costs alone wasted 180 million yuan (freight not included). Six thousand jin of taro transferred from the Changzhou Native Produce Branch rotted more than 30,000 jin because of too much soil and failure to handle them in time. The stock of straw mats suffered a total loss of more than 25 million yuan due to mold and loss. In addition, more than 150 dan of daylily and more than 500 packages of melon seeds (more than 100 jin per package) became moldy. In terms of processing costs, the country's assets have also suffered great losses due to the lack of serious and thorough investigation and research in advance. For example, when using machines to squeeze soybeans in Kunshan County, they blindly agreed to the standard of 14 jin of oil per dan of soybeans proposed by some manufacturers. However, at that time, manual soybean squeezing in Changshu County could produce 17.5 jin of oil. In this way, processing 40,000 dan of soybeans cost an additional 24 million yuan in processing fees.
    Individual leading cadres, such as Deputy Manager Wang Shizhong, are extravagant in their lives. Warehouse Director Gu Fuquan and Business Section Chief Xiao Jun followed suit.
    The company's leading cadres seriously violated the Trade Union Law. The company never consulted with the trade union when adding or dismissing people. Trade union member You Ke Yi suffered from lung disease, and the trade union suggested to the administration to give him some subsidies, but the administration ignored it.
    I think the problems existing in the Suzhou Branch of the China Native Produce Company are quite serious. If they are not resolved in time, it will be impossible to complete the more important work tasks in 1952. I hope the higher authorities will pay serious attention to this issue and investigate and deal with it.

    Shanxi Provincial Construction Company Should Investigate Waste
    Comrade Editor: The Shanxi Provincial Construction Company has wasted a lot of national wealth in the past year. The company started construction of the dormitory project for the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant without the approval of the Taiyuan Municipal Construction Bureau. As a result, it was fined 2 million yuan. Adding the losses from engineering design errors and material waste, the total loss was more than 148 million yuan. In the spring of 1951, due to errors in the instructions of the construction department, the first floor of the Yuncheng Flour Mill building project contracted by the company was completely reworked, losing more than 38,000 jin of millet. The company once recruited 68 workers from Shanghai, and at that time, the contract guaranteed that workers would have at least 25 days of work per month, and each person's daily wage was 19,000 yuan. However, after the workers arrived, they only worked seven days a month, and there was nothing to do for the rest of the days, and the company had to pay wages according to the contract. In more than two months, it lost another 40 million yuan. The company's accumulation of funds is also very serious. For example, due to the lack of production planning, a large number of materials such as foreign cement, steel bars, and plywood were put aside, and the accumulated funds amounted to hundreds of millions of yuan. There are also many wastes in other projects and materials. The main reason for the waste is that the company's leading cadres only pay attention to production and do not pay attention to business management. I think the leading cadres of the Shanxi Provincial Construction Company should deeply examine these wasteful incidents.

    Nanchang Department Store Company Has Serious Shortcomings in Work
    Comrade Editor: The staff of the Nanchang Department Store Company of China Department Store Company have serious mercenary views. Their attitude towards customers is very bad. Volunteer Army wounded soldier Zhu Fengxiang said: "When I go to the department store to buy things, I see that they (referring to the shop assistants of this company) always greet the fashionable customers first. We have to wait for a long time to buy things. Some wounded comrades cannot stand for a long time because of leg injuries. The company's shop assistants not only do not take care of them, but also show impatience." A worker reflected: "The toothpaste we bought in the department store cannot be squeezed out. When we ask for the reason, the shop assistants in the company not only do not explain it well, but say: "If you want to buy, say it quickly, so as not to waste time." Their bad attitude towards customers is mainly because they have not yet established the point of view of serving the people wholeheartedly. When the company's trade union launched everyone to sign a patriotic pact, Comrade Rao Hanzhang, the business section chief of the company, said: "What's the use of signing a patriotic pact if the business is not doing well?" The staff handed over the signed patriotic pact to the manager of the sales department for review, and it was actually suppressed by the manager for two months. We believe that the leading cadres of the Nanchang Department Store Company should quickly correct these wrong ideas.

    Hengshui and Shijiazhuang Trust Companies
    Violating Price Policies Should Be Reviewed
    Comrade Editor: Ensuring grain supply in cotton-growing areas and safeguarding the interests of cotton farmers are important political tasks of our trade system and grain companies at all levels. However, leading cadres of state-owned enterprises in individual regions have a pure profit perspective. They sell wheat at high prices in cotton-growing areas, which affects the stability of prices. According to the latest report of the Hebei Provincial Grain Branch: Hengshui Trust Company of Hebei Province sold wheat on December 2, 1951, and the market price was 5% higher than the listed price. After the Industry and Commerce Section of the Commissioner's Office learned of this situation, it made suggestions and asked them to sell at the listed price. Hengshui Trust Company not only did not accept the opinion, but immediately stopped the supply, resulting in a temporary imbalance in the supply and demand of wheat, which caused the market price to rise sharply by 3.39%. Later, the local grain company withdrew a part of the wheat from the grain depot and vigorously supplied it, which brought the price down. On December 4, Shijiazhuang Trust Company also sold wheat at a price 7.4% higher than the listed price, which affected the local grain company's control of grain prices.
    We believe that the practice of Hengshui and Shijiazhuang Trust Companies to violate price policies and the pure profit-making perspective are wrong. We hope that they will conduct a deep review.

    The Brick Machine Made by Dahua Iron Factory Does Not Meet Specifications
    Causing Great Losses to the Henan Provincial Construction Company Machinery Brick and Tile Factory
    Comrade Editor: The Henan Provincial Construction Company Machinery Brick and Tile Factory ordered a brick machine from the Shanghai Dahua Iron Factory in February 1951, worth 49 million yuan. In July 1951, the two parties delivered the goods and paid the payment in Zhengzhou. At that time, the iron factory guaranteed that the brick machine could produce 3,000 bricks per hour, and the East China Industrial Department Manager's Office acted as a guarantor. In order to install the brick machine, the brick and tile factory started to build the brick machine room and purchase steam engines and motors from February 1951, spending a total of more than 620 million yuan. However, when installing the brick machine, technician Ye Pinqing found that the brick machine was manufactured to substandard specifications and could not be used at all. The brick and tile factory immediately wrote to the Shanghai Dahua Iron Factory, asking them to send someone to repair it; but the other party kept playing tricks and refused to give a definite answer. The brick and tile factory sent personnel to Shanghai to negotiate directly, but the iron factory still did not seriously solve the problem. The brick and tile factory has requested the East China Industrial Department to assist in handling this issue, but no results have been obtained so far. The irresponsible attitude of the Shanghai Dahua Iron Factory has seriously damaged state property. I believe that the East China Industrial Department Manager's Office should cooperate with the local relevant departments to order the Dahua Iron Factory to compensate for the losses in accordance with the contract.

    奸商林振铎、孙起会等Stealing National Assets Sentenced to Imprisonment
    Henan Province Lanfeng County Beiguan Senmao Wood Plank Shop Manager Lin Zhenduo, Sun Qihui, etc., have consistently engaged in speculation and profiteering, trickery and extortion in their operations. They buy wood planks on behalf of customers, which originally only cost 210,000 yuan per square zhang, but they charge customers 250,000 yuan. Not long ago, when they transported wood planks to an airport somewhere, they stole a large truckload in the middle and sold it for 5 million yuan. In September 1951, the Lanfeng Trading Company entrusted this merchant to purchase wood planks on its behalf. When they measured them, they took the opportunity to write six more square zhang on the account because they saw that only one person from the Trading Company had come. Later, they used the same method to write thirteen more square zhang; after measuring the wood planks, they stole three square zhang sporadically. In August 1950, the wood planks stored by the Trading Company in their place were stolen by them for ten square zhang. Senmao Wood Plank Shop stole a total of thirty-two square zhang of wood planks from the Trading Company. They reported these problems to the county court because of uneven distribution of stolen goods. After the court summoned and confronted them, they admitted these facts one by one. In order to expand the impact, the Lanfeng County People's Court, together with the County Industry and Commerce Section and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, convened a county-wide merchants' conference and tried them on the spot. Finally, the court announced that in addition to ordering the Senmao Wood Plank Shop to compensate for the losses suffered by the Trading Company, Lin Zhenduo was sentenced to one year of fixed-term imprisonment and Sun Qihui was sentenced to half a year of fixed-term imprisonment.

    Nanchang Private Dalu Construction Factory, etc.
    Ignoring Workers' Life Safety
    Comrade Editor: The Nanchang Public New China Brick and Tile Factory is building a large tunnel kiln. This tunnel kiln was contracted by the Shanghai Yiyuji Construction Factory; the kiln shed protecting the tunnel kiln was contracted by the Nanchang Private Dalu Construction Factory. When the Dalu Construction Factory built the kiln shed, it should have started from the walls around the shed, but they did not follow the rules, but started from the highest main shed in the middle of the kiln shed first. This practice caused the kiln shed to lose the support of the side sheds on both sides, and the foundation was unstable. The New China Brick and Tile Factory was eager to achieve results and did not stop it. On October 19, 1951, the Dalu Construction Factory put more than 10,000 tiles on the main shed, and put 5,000 more on the south side, causing the high and isolated main shed to lose its balance. On the same day, Engineer Yi of the Yiyuji Construction Factory discovered that the main shed was tilted, and asked Engineer Li, the foreman of the brick and tile factory, to pass this opinion on to Huang Jinsheng, the owner of the Dalu Construction Factory. Huang glanced at it and said: "It doesn't matter if there is no wind." On the morning of the 20th, Engineer Yi saw that the main shed was even more tilted, and hurriedly reported to the relevant personnel of the brick and tile factory, but they did not take any emergency measures. Soon, the main shed collapsed, injuring 23 construction workers, including 5 seriously injured. This accident was entirely the result of the Dalu Construction Factory, etc. not paying attention to the safety of workers' lives. I suggest that the local government agencies give appropriate punishment. Gu Jiancheng

    中国土产公司苏州支公司
    领导干部浪费渎职
    编辑同志：中国土产公司苏州支公司领导干部有严重的官僚主义和铺张浪费现象。在业务上，领导干部包办代替，科长、股长都感到有职无权，不能发挥工作的积极性，因而不断发生霉烂、短少物资和其他浪费国家财产的事情。例如，这个公司在一九五一年夏季，调拨了五万担东北大豆饼，因事前没有计划，竟由太仓办事处运到昆山办事处，再由昆山办事处运到苏州支公司，最后又运到吴县办事处，造成了物资大旅行。据统计，只装卸费就浪费了一亿八千万元（运费还没有计算在内）。从常州土产支公司调来的芋艿六万斤，因泥土太多，又没有及时处理，结果烂了三万多斤。库存的草席，连霉烂带丢失，共损失二千五百多万元。此外，还有一百五十担金针菜，五百多包瓜子（每包一百多斤）生了霉。在加工费用方面，由于事前缺乏认真周密的调查研究，也使国家资财遭受了很大损失。如在昆山县用机器榨黄豆时，盲目地同意某些厂商所提的每担黄豆出油十四斤的标准。但当时在常熟县用手工榨黄豆，都可出油十七斤半。这样，榨四万担黄豆，就多花了二千四百万元加工费。
    个别领导干部，如副经理王时中，生活上铺张浪费。仓库主任顾福全，业务科长萧俊也跟着学。
    公司的领导干部严重地违犯工会法。公司添人或辞退人，从来没有和工会商量过。工会会员尤克颐生肺病，工会向行政建议给他一些补助，但行政方面理也不理。
    我认为中国土产公司苏州支公司存在的问题是相当严重的。如不及时解决，就无法完成一九五二年更重大的工作任务。希望上级机关对这一问题引起严重注意，并检查处理。    克  安
    山西省建筑公司应检查浪费
    编辑同志：山西省建筑公司一年来浪费了国家很多的财富。这个公司承建的太原钢铁厂宿舍工程，没有经过太原市建设局批准，就开工了。结果，被罚款二百万元。加上工程设计错误的损失和材料的浪费，共损失了一亿四千八百多万元。一九五一年春季，公司承包的运城面粉厂大楼工程，由于施工部门指示错误，以致大楼的第一层全部返工，损失小米三万八千多斤。公司曾到上海招雇工人六十八名，当时在合同上保证工人每月至少有二十五天的工作，每人每天的工资为一万九千元。但工人来了以后，每个月只做七天工，其他的日子都没有事做，公司也得按合同付工资。两个多月中，又损失了四千多万元。公司积压资金的情况也很严重。如因生产没有计划，大量洋灰、钢筋、三合板等材料被搁置，积压资金达数亿元。其他工程和材料上的浪费也是很多的。产生浪费的原因，主要是公司领导干部只重视生产，不重视经营管理。我认为山西省建筑公司领导干部应深刻检查这些浪费事件。

    南昌市百货公司工作有严重的缺点
    编辑同志：中国百货公司南昌市公司职工，有严重的雇佣观点。他们对待顾客的态度非常不好。志愿军伤病员朱凤翔说：“我到百货公司买东西时，看见他们（指这个公司的店员）总是先招呼穿得时髦的顾客。我们得等半天才能买到东西。有的伤员同志因腿部受伤，不能久站，公司店员不但不去照护，还现出不耐烦的样子。”一个工人反映：“我们在百货公司买的牙膏，挤不出来。我们去问原因，公司里的店员不但不很好地解释，反说：要不要快说，免得耽误功夫。”他们对顾客态度这样坏，主要是由于他们还没有确立全心全意为人民服务的观点。公司里卖的糖，上面落了灰；有些货物快霉坏了，也没人管。最严重的是有些店员不执行制度，凭私人感情随意赊货，常发生账货不符的严重现象。
    公司的职工为什么会有这样严重的雇佣观点而长期不能改正呢？这是领导方面忽视职工政治思想领导的结果。公司的工会发动大家订立爱国公约时，公司业务科长饶汉章同志说：“业务还搞不好，订爱国公约有什么用？”职工把订好的爱国公约，交门市部经理审核，竟被经理压了两个月。我们认为，南昌市百货公司的领导干部，应该迅速纠正这些错误思想。

    衡水、石家庄两地信托公司
    违反价格政策应作检讨
    编辑同志：保证棉区粮食供应，维护棉农利益，是我们贸易系统和各级粮食公司重要的政治任务。但有个别地区的公营企业的领导干部，有单纯利润观点，他们在棉区高价出售小麦，影响了物价的稳定。据最近河北省粮食分公司的报告：河北省衡水信托公司在一九五一年十二月二日出售小麦，市价高出牌价百分之五。专署工商科知道这一情况以后，曾提出意见，请他们按牌价出售。衡水信托公司不但不接受意见，并马上停止供应，以致小麦暂时供求失调，使市场价格猛升百分之三·三九。后来当地粮食公司从粮库提出小麦一部，大力供应，才把价格平抑下来。十二月四日，石家庄信托公司也发生了高出牌价百分之七·四出售小麦的事情，影响了当地粮食公司对粮价的掌握。
    我们认为衡水和石家庄两地信托公司这种违反物价政策的作法和单纯的营利观点是不对的。希望他们进行深刻检讨。

    大华铁工厂所制砖机不合规格
    使河南省建筑公司机器砖瓦厂遭受很大损失
    编辑同志：河南省建筑公司机器砖瓦厂在一九五一年二月向上海大华铁工厂订购砖机一部，价值四千九百万元。一九五一年七月间，双方在郑州交货付款。当时铁工厂保证砖机每小时产砖三千块，并由华东工业部经理处作保。为了安装砖机，砖瓦厂从一九五一年二月份开始建造砖机房，购买蒸汽引擎和马达，共用了六亿二千多万元。但安装砖机时，技师叶品清发觉砖机制造得不合规格，根本不能使用。砖瓦厂立刻写信给上海大华铁工厂，要他们派人来修理；但对方一味耍手段，不肯确切答复。砖瓦厂派员到上海直接交涉，铁工厂仍不认真解决这个问题。砖瓦厂已请求华东工业部协助处理这个问题，可是，到现在仍未得到结果。上海大华铁工厂这种不负责任的态度，严重损害了国家的财产。我认为华东工业部经理处应协同当地有关部门，责成大华铁工厂，按照合同赔偿损失。  王书生
    奸商林振铎、孙起会等
    窃取国家资财被判徒刑
    河南省兰封县北关森茂木板行经理林振铎、孙起会等，在经营上一贯投机倒把、刁骗讹诈。他们给客人代购木板，本来每方丈只需二十一万元，但却向客人索取二十五万元。不久以前给某地飞机场运送木板，他们在中途偷了一大车，卖了五百万元。一九五一年九月，兰封贸易公司托这个商号代购木板，他们在丈量时，因见贸易公司只来了一个人，就乘机在账上多写了六方丈，以后又用同样办法，多写十三方丈；在量木板以后，又零星偷去三方丈。一九五○年八月，贸易公司存在他们那里的木板，被他们偷了十方丈。森茂木板行共盗窃贸易公司木板三十二方丈。他们因分赃不均，同伙丁照中来县法院报告，才发现这些问题。经法院传讯对证，他们一一承认了这些事实。兰封县人民法院为扩大影响，会同县工商科、工商业联合会，召集了全县商户大会，当场审讯。最后法院宣布，除判决森茂木板行须赔偿贸易公司所受损失外，并判处林振铎有期徒刑一年，孙起会有期徒刑半年。    王传钦
    南昌市私营大陆营造厂等
    忽视工人生命安全
    编辑同志：南昌市公营新中国砖瓦厂兴建一座大轮窑。这座轮窑由上海易玉记营造厂承建；保护轮窑的窑棚则由南昌市私营大陆营造厂承包。大陆营造厂盖窑棚时，论理应该从棚四周的围墙做起，但他们不按规矩，却先从窑棚当中最高的正棚做起。这种做法，使窑棚失去两旁偏棚的支架，基础不稳。新中国砖瓦厂因急于求成，竟不加以制止。一九五一年十月十九日，大陆营造厂又在正棚上盖了一万多块瓦，而且在南面多盖了五千块，使高而孤立的正棚失掉平衡。当日，易玉记营造厂易工程师发现正棚倾斜，请砖瓦厂监工李工程师把这个意见转告大陆营造厂老板黄锦生，黄看了一看说：“不起风没关系。”二十日晨，易工程师看见正棚更斜，急忙报告砖瓦厂有关人员，但他们并没有采取任何紧急措施。不久，正棚塌倒，压伤建筑工人二十三名，其中五名重伤。这次事故完全是大陆营造厂等不重视工人生命安全的结果，我建议当地政府机关，给以适当的处分。    顾建成
