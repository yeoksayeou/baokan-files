    Beware of New Provocations by the U.S. Air Force
    While the U.S. side is delaying the Korean armistice talks, the U.S. invading air force in Korea has recently continuously intruded into our Northeast border and carried out bombing and strafing. On December 26th, a U.S. Air Force plane intruded into the airspace over Dadonggou in Liaodong Province and Guojiatun near the area, carrying out bombing, wounding eight of our residents, destroying five houses, and killing two mules. On December 31st, another U.S. plane intruded into the airspace over Dadonggou east and Wenjialou, bombing and strafing, wounding five of our residents and destroying fourteen houses. On the 6th of this month, eight U.S. planes successively intruded into the airspace over Shizhuzi in Ji'an County and Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, and dropped bombs over Ji'an Railway Station, wounding three of our station staff and destroying railway tracks and other materials.
    Don't the recent continuous acts of aggression and provocation by U.S. Air Force planes fully expose the despicable and bloody face of the U.S. imperialists attempting to persist in and expand the war of aggression against Korea? As the U.S. negotiating representatives dream of forcing our side to accept their unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs and detain part of our captured personnel, the Korean armistice talks have recently fallen into a stalemate. But the U.S. representatives are not only unwilling to break the stalemate in the negotiations, but openly declare: "Unless you (referring to the Chinese and Korean side) accept our plan, we will prepare cannons, bombs and bullets to continue the debate." The U.S. side wants to use the "debate" of cannons, bombs and bullets to obtain what cannot be obtained in the debate at the armistice negotiation table, and the U.S. side has re-extended this bloody armed aggression, which they shamelessly call "debate," into our territory. Our compatriots have been continuously wounded by U.S. bombs, and the property of our people has been continuously destroyed by U.S. bombs. U.S. imperialism refuses to resolve the Korean issue by peaceful means, and therefore does not hesitate to use the "debate" of bombs to replace the debate at the armistice negotiation conference table. Our people throughout the country must further recognize the true face of U.S. imperialism as an enemy of peace and an enemy of our people from these facts, and the peace-loving people of the world must increase their vigilance against this deadly enemy of peace a hundredfold.
    But no matter whether U.S. imperialism adopts the method of negotiation, or the method of war or military threat, they can never achieve their aggressive goals. The Chinese and Korean People's Army and the people of China and Korea have long been prepared to teach the forgetful enemy a lesson by more thoroughly crushing the enemy's offensive once the United States breaks the negotiations. The act of U.S. imperialism to expand the war of aggression will inevitably lead to greater and more tragic failures in the end. The countless times that U.S. imperialism has carried out bombing and strafing against our country, causing huge casualties to our compatriots and huge losses to the property of our people, this blood debt must eventually be repaid in double.

### 警惕美国空军的新挑衅

    警惕美国空军的新挑衅
    在美方拖延朝鲜停战谈判的同时，美国侵朝空军最近又连续侵入我国东北国境，并实行轰炸扫射。美国空军飞机一架，于十二月二十六日侵入我辽东省大东沟及该地附近的郭家屯上空，实行轰炸，炸伤我居民八人，炸毁房屋五间及炸死骡子两匹。十二月三十一日，又有美国飞机一架侵入大东沟以东及温家楼上空轰炸扫射，炸伤我居民五人，炸毁房屋十四间。本月六日，美国飞机八架又先后侵入我辽东省辑安县及宽甸县属石柱子上空，并在辑安车站上空投弹，炸伤我车站工作人员三名，并炸毁铁轨及其他物资。
    美国空军飞机最近接连不断的侵略挑衅行为，难道不是充分地暴露了美帝国主义者妄图坚持并扩大侵朝战争的卑鄙血腥面目吗？由于美国谈判代表梦想强迫我方接受他们所提出的干涉我方内政及扣留我方一部分被俘人员的无理要求，朝鲜停战谈判最近已经陷于僵局。但是美方代表不但不愿意打开谈判的僵局，反而公然声称：“除非你们（指中朝方面）接受我们的方案，否则我们将准备大炮、炸弹和子弹去继续辩论。”美方要用大炮、炸弹和子弹的“辩论”来取得在停战谈判的辩论中所不能取得的东西，并且美方已经把这种他们所无耻地称之为“辩论”的血腥的武装侵略行动重新扩展到我们国境以内了。我们的同胞已经接连地被美国炸弹所炸伤，我国人民的财产已经接连地被美国炸弹所毁灭。美帝国主义拒绝用和平的方法解决朝鲜问题，因而不惜用炸弹的“辩论”来代替停战谈判会议桌上的辩论。我们全国人民必须从这些事实中进一步地认识美帝国主义仇视和平、仇视我国人民的真面目，全世界爱好和平的人民必须百倍地提高对于这个和平的死敌的警惕。
    但是不管美帝国主义是采取谈判的方法也好，或者是采取战争或军事的威胁方法也好，他们都绝对不能达到他们的侵略目的。中朝人民军队和中朝两国人民，早就准备着一旦美国破裂谈判时以更彻底地粉碎敌人的进攻来教训那装着健忘的敌人。美国帝国主义者扩大侵略战争的行为，最后必然要得到更大的更悲惨的失败。美国帝国主义无数次对我国实行轰炸扫射，造成了我们同胞的巨大死伤和我国人民财产的巨大损失，这笔血债最后必须加倍地清偿。
