    Pang Dianchen and the Heroic Fifth Company
    Our heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Fifth Company, in the battle to defend the Yanxian Mountain highland east of the Linjin River for three days and four nights, wiped out more than 1,200 men of the U.S. Imperialist's proudest "ace" unit, the 7th Regiment of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division. The entire company was awarded a Special Merit.
    The battle began on the morning of October 6, 1951. Our side was surrounded on three sides by the enemy, but in a day and a night of fighting, we repelled nine enemy assaults.
    On the 7th, the enemy's offensive was even more frantic than the previous day, but they bravely and arduously defended their positions, repelling three assaults by two companies of the enemy.
    On the 8th, the enemy used a regiment of troops to launch a fierce attack on the Yanxian Mountain highland, and they even more shamelessly dropped poisonous colored gas bombs, gasoline bombs, smoke bombs, and destructive fragmentation bombs. Despite the enemy's brutality, our heroic soldiers calmly fought back. At this time, they were squatting in shell craters resting, deliberately letting the frantic enemy blindly bombard. After a while, Fifth Squad soldier Li Daixiang saw a group of enemies cautiously climbing up. He immediately went back to report to everyone, saying: "Brothers! The enemy is coming for a feast! (meaning the enemies were pushing each other, afraid to rush up) Quickly give them iron biscuits (i.e., hand grenades) to eat!" Suddenly, the soldiers were all full of energy, lying in the shell craters, waiting, secretly calculating the distance between themselves and the enemy. Bang! A string of "iron biscuits" blossomed among the devils, leaving only a few remnants to roll down the mountain. As the battle progressed to noon, the enemy launched another fierce attack, and the company's bullets were used up. Company Political Instructor Comrade Pang Dianchen thought: "This is the time for a Communist Party member to give his life to the Party and the people!" So, he immediately put forward the slogan "Don't disgrace Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland, only by driving the devils down can we achieve victory." He then picked up more than a dozen hand grenades and personally led the soldiers of the Second Platoon to charge towards the enemy. They fought halfway up the mountain and, in coordination with the company commander, drove the enemy down the mountain. (Attached picture)

    庞殿臣和英雄第五连
    我们英雄的志愿军某部第五连，在临津江以东坚守岩岘山高地三天四夜的战斗中，歼灭了美帝国主义最得意的“王牌”军美骑一师第七团一千二百余名。全连立了特等功。
    战斗在一九五一年十月六日早上开始。我方被敌人三面层层围困，但在一天一夜的战斗之中，一共打垮敌人九次冲锋。
    七日，敌人的进攻比前一日更加疯狂，然而他们是这样英勇艰苦地坚守在自己的阵地上，一连打退了敌人两个连的三次冲锋。
    八日那天，敌人用一团兵力向岩岘山高地猛攻，它们更无耻地投下了有毒的五色弹、汽油弹、烟幕弹、破坏杀伤弹。尽管敌人如此残暴，但是，我们英勇的战士们却仍是沉着地打击着敌人。这时他们正蹲在弹坑里休息，故意让疯狂的敌人去盲目轰击。不一会，五班战士李代祥看到一撮敌人在畏首缩脑地爬上来了。他立刻回去报告大家说：“兄弟们！敌人会餐来啦！（意即敌人相互推让着不敢冲上来）快出来给他们铁饼干（即手榴弹）吃吧！”一下子，战士们个个生龙活虎般地伏在弹坑里等待着，暗暗地计算着自己与敌人的距离。通！一串“铁饼干”在鬼子当中开了花，只剩下几名残兵滚下山去。战斗进行到中午，敌人又一次猛冲，连里的子弹用完了。连政治指导员庞殿臣同志想：“这正是共产党员把生命交给党和人民的时候！”于是，他立即提出“不给毛主席和祖国人民丢脸，只有把鬼子打下去，才能得到胜利”的口号。他又拿起十几个手榴弹，亲自带了二排战士冲向敌人，打到半山，与连长配合把敌人打下山去。（附图片）
