At the Third Plenary Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao put forward the task of increasing production and practicing economy as the central task of the people of the whole country. Increasing production and practicing economy is not only the most effective way to support the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, but also the fundamental policy and basic method for building our great motherland; it not only has a significant effect on increasing the country's material wealth and accelerating the country's economic construction, but also has an extremely significant meaning for improving our work style and cultivating new and excellent moral qualities.

The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League believes that: the Youth League organizations at all levels and all members of the League should enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, unite and lead the broad masses of young people across the country, actively participate in the movement of "increasing production and practicing economy," and take the development of the movement of increasing production and practicing economy as the central link in promoting all our work.

Second, regarding increasing production, the Youth League organizations at all levels should conduct ideological education on the patriotic production increase movement to all members of the League and the broad masses of young people, improve the political consciousness of the broad masses of young people, improve work methods and production technology, and strive to create more wealth for the motherland through the League’s educational work and the exemplary actions of League members. However, in the production increase movement, attention should be paid to preventing the tendency of recklessness. Practices that simply increase working hours and labor intensity without restraint, to the point of harming the health of young people, must be corrected and prevented.

	(1) In factories, the Youth League organizations should carry out the following work to strive to complete and overfulfill production tasks: 1. Cultivate in young workers a conscious labor attitude and an excellent style of strictly observing labor discipline; 2. Promote young workers to learn production technology, put forward rationalization proposals, and promote advanced production experience; 3. Reduce the consumption of raw materials and cherish machinery and factory equipment; 4. According to possible conditions, organize mass product inspections in factories, and strive to eliminate defective products; 5. Strengthen the unity between young technicians and young workers, advocate the combination of labor and technology, and improve production methods.

	(2) In rural areas, the Youth League organizations should carry out the following work to assist the broad masses of farmers in increasing the production per unit area: 1. Lead League members to actively participate in and promote production mutual aid organizations; 2. Encourage young people to learn and promote advanced production technologies, and improve the production and quality of crops; 3. Unite young people to fight against crop diseases, insect pests, and other natural disasters (floods, droughts, etc.).

	(3) In government agencies, the Youth League organizations should educate League members and other young people to consciously obey work needs and organizational assignments, settle down to work, study business, and improve work efficiency.

	(4) In schools, the Youth League organizations should cooperate closely with student unions, lead League members and all students to study hard, and improve political awareness, so as to better serve the great cause of defending and building the new China in the future.

	(5) In other various positions, the Youth League organizations should also unite young people, play an active role, and work and study hard for the construction of the motherland.

Third, regarding practicing economy, the Youth League organizations at all levels should first conduct education and inspection within their own ranks, criticize and correct various extravagant and wasteful phenomena, and resolutely eliminate all corrupt and degenerate thoughts and actions.

The League organizations at all levels should, under the leadership and support of the Party, mobilize League members to fight against various adverse phenomena that violate the principles of economy, and first of all, fight against the following adverse phenomena: (1) extravagance and waste, corrupt and degenerate behavior; (2) phenomena of wasting manpower and materials in work; (3) phenomena of destroying public property; (4) losses of state property caused by bureaucracy, etc. For serious waste of state property and corrupt and degenerate behavior, the League organizations and all League members should and must make solemn reports to higher-level organs or other appropriate organs, but the reports must be based on the interests of the people and the country, and must be based on responsible and detailed investigations in advance, and obtain reliable evidence; do not hearsay or act rashly, so as not to cause adverse consequences instead. The method of reporting can be reported through the Party and League organizations (may be escalated when necessary), or directly reported and exposed to the Party newspapers and League newspapers.

Fourth, the Youth League organizations at all levels should adopt the following methods and other appropriate methods to ensure the correct implementation of the increase production and practice economy movement in the various work of the Youth League:

	(1) The Youth League organizations at all levels should, according to the plans of the Party and the administration and the specific conditions of the unit, widely mobilize the masses of young people to formulate or actively participate in patriotic pacts with the main content of carrying out the "increase production and practice economy" movement. The Youth League members should become models in observing and implementing the patriotic pacts.

	(2) The Youth League organizations at all levels should take the achievements of increasing production and practicing economy as the main basis for assessing the work of the Youth League organizations at all levels. The Youth League organizations at all levels should pay attention to promptly discovering and promoting typical experiences to promote the progress of the "increase production and practice economy" movement. The League organizations and League members who have made outstanding achievements in increasing production and practicing economy should be commended and rewarded; the League organizations and League members who neglect this work or violate the principles of increasing production and practicing economy should be criticized and punished.

	(3) The Youth League organizations at all levels should maintain close contact with all relevant parties, especially in reporting serious acts of violating economy, they should contact the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Party Committee at the same level and the People's Supervision Committee at the same level, and obtain their guidance and assistance.

	(4) The Youth League organizations at all levels promote the "increase production and practice economy" movement, mainly relying on propaganda and persuasion methods to inspire the conscious initiative of the masses of young people, and must not adopt any coercive and commanding practices.

    关于开展增产节约运动的决议
    一、在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次全体会议上，毛主席提出了以增加生产，厉行节约，作为全国人民当前的中心任务。增产节约不仅是支援抗美援朝战争的最有效方法，而且是建设我们伟大祖国的根本方针和基本方法；不仅对于增加国家物质财富和加速国家的经济建设有着重大的作用，而且对于改进我们的工作作风，培养新的优良的道德品质，具有极为重大的意义。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会第二次全体会议认为：中国新民主主义青年团的各级组织和全体团员，应该热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，团结和领导全国广大青年，积极参加“增加生产、厉行节约”的运动，并把开展增产节约的运动，作为推进我们一切工作的中心环节。
    二、在增加生产方面，各级青年团组织应当向全体团员和广大青年进行关于爱国增产运动的思想教育，通过团的教育工作和团员的模范行动，去提高广大青年的政治觉悟，改进工作方法和生产技术，努力为祖国创造更多的财富。但是在增产运动中，应当注意防止拚命主义的偏向，对于没有节制地单纯增加劳动时间和劳动强度，以至损害青年的健康的做法，必须加以纠正和防止。

    （3）破坏公共财产的现象；（4）由于官僚主义而招致国家财产的损失等。对于严重浪费国家财物的行为及贪污腐化行为，团的组织和全体团员应当而且必须向上级机关或其他适当的机关进行严正的检举，但检举必须以人民和国家的利益为出发点，必须事先经过负责的详细的调查，获得确实可靠的证据；不得道听途说，轻率进行，以致反而引起不良的后果。检举的方式可以通过党和团的组织（必要时可越级）上报，也可直接向党报和团报报告揭露。
