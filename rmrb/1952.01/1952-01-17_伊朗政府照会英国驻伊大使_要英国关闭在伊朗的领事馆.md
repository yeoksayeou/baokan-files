Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, January 14th: The press is widely reporting that Iranian Foreign Minister Kazemi delivered a note to the British Ambassador on January 12th. The note demanded that all British consulates in Iran be closed by January 21st. The note stated that the Iranian government "can no longer tolerate the British officials' policy of interfering in Iranian internal affairs" and "considers it its duty and right, from the perspective of safeguarding its own highest interests" to demand the closure of all British consulates in Iran. This demand is based on the following reasons: First, the activities of officials in British consulates throughout Iran "go beyond general consular functions, and they interfere in Iranian internal affairs, thereby infringing upon national independence"; second, after the establishment of the states of India and Pakistan, they can independently dispatch consuls to necessary locations within Iran, and therefore the number of British nationals has decreased, and there is no longer any need for the British government to set up consular representatives in many locations in Iran; third, since consular relations between the Iranian government and the British government are based on reciprocal conditions, and although Iran has a large number of nationals in Britain, the Iranian government has not established a consulate on British territory, then there is no need for the British government to establish consulates on Iranian territory.
    Prior to this, the Iranian government had handed a note to the British Embassy in Tehran on January 9th. According to the "Atesh" newspaper, the British Embassy has returned the note.
    The "Bakhtar Emrooz" newspaper pointed out: The Iranian note of January 9th lodged a firm protest against "the recent intensification of activities by British Embassy personnel in Iran and their open interference in Iranian internal affairs"; this is because "in the past two weeks, especially after the return of British Ambassador Shepherd from London, British intelligence agencies have intensified their activities in Iran. British agents are now moving freely within Iran, formulating plans to create bloody incidents, coups, and support the parliamentary opposition."

    伊朗政府照会英国驻伊大使
    要英国关闭在伊朗的领事馆
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰十四日讯：各报广泛刊载伊朗外交大臣卡斯米一月十二日递交英国大使的照会。照会要求英国在伊朗各地的领事馆在一月二十一日以前一律关闭。照会说：伊朗政府“再不能容忍英国官员干涉伊朗内政的政策”，并且“认为有责任、也有权利从保卫本国最高利益的观点上”要求英国驻伊朗的一切领事馆关闭。这个要求基于下列理由：第一，英国政府设在伊朗各地的领事馆的官员的活动“超越一般领事职权，他们并干涉伊朗内政，从而侵犯本国独立”；第二，印度与巴基斯坦国家成立后，可以自行派遣领事驻在伊朗境内必要的地点，因此英国侨民的数目已经减少，英国政府已无必要在伊朗许多地点设置领事代表；第三，既然伊朗政府和英国政府之间的领事关系是以相互的条件为基础的，而伊朗虽然在英国有大批侨民，可是伊朗政府并没有在英国的领土上设置一个领事馆，那么英国政府也无必要在伊朗的领土上设置领事馆了。
    在此之前，伊朗政府曾于一月九日将照会一件交给英国驻德黑兰大使馆，据“阿德什报”报道：英国大使馆已将该项照会退回。
    “巴赫塔利·伊姆鲁兹报”指出：一月九日伊朗的照会对“英国大使馆人员最近在伊朗加紧活动并公开干涉伊朗内政”，提出坚决抗议；这是因为“在过去两星期内，特别在英国大使谢佩德从伦敦回来以后，英国情报机关已经在伊朗加紧活动。英国特务现在在伊朗境内通行无阻，制订着制造血腥事件、政变和支持议会反对派等计划。”
