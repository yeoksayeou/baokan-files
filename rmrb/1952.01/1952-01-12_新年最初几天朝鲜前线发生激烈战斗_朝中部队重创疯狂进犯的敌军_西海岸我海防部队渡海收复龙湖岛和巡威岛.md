Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 11th. Our front-line reporter reports: In the first few days of the New Year, even fiercer fighting occurred on the Western Front. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers repelled even larger-scale, frenzied offensives by the American invading army there. Starting on the 3rd, in fierce battles north of Changdan at Jilingdong North Mountain and another high ground, the invading enemy committed a regiment of troops. Under the cover of five artillery groups, more than ten tanks, and multiple aircraft, the enemy troops launched many "duck rush"-style group assaults. Our troops used fierce artillery fire and various automatic weapons to meet the attack. In the fierce battle, enemy troops fell with almost every step forward, sometimes dozens of people. The enemy army once climbed a hilltop after suffering heavy casualties, but this hilltop was immediately retaken by our army with a fierce counterattack, and a large number of enemy troops were killed and wounded on the cold, windswept mountains. After more than five hours of fierce fighting, our troops killed and wounded more than 430 enemy soldiers, forcing the enemy to flee south in a panic. On the 4th, a unit of our army in the area fought with more than two companies of the invading enemy, killing and wounding more than 60 enemy soldiers. On the 5th, the enemy army again used a regiment of troops, coordinated with many artillery groups and more than ten tanks, to fiercely attack our two high grounds; but under the strong resistance of our army, the enemy army suffered the same disastrous defeat as on the 3rd.

On the Central Front, the enemy army launched multiple attacks on our positions near Jincheng, Keho-ri, and other places with forces ranging from dozens to hundreds of men for several consecutive days, but all were repelled by our army, and more than 130 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. One squad of our army made a surprise attack on enemy troops on a high ground southeast of Jincheng on the night of the 4th. The brave soldiers crossed three rows of barbed wire, and only after seizing a machine gun at the entrance of the enemy bunker did the enemy hastily respond. In a brief but fierce battle, the brave soldiers annihilated an entire platoon of enemy soldiers in the area.

On the Eastern Front, the enemy army attacked a high ground east of the Bukhan River with a force of one to two companies on the 2nd and 3rd, launching more than ten assaults, all of which were repelled by our strong firepower, and more than 60 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. On the 4th, a company of the American invading army invaded our position east of Height 1211, and more than 80 were killed or wounded, with the remaining enemy troops retreating south from the heavily snow-covered foothills. On the West Coast, our coastal defense forces crossed the sea and recovered Longhu Island and Xunwei Island south of Ongjin.

    新年最初几天朝鲜前线发生激烈战斗
    朝中部队重创疯狂进犯的敌军
    西海岸我海防部队渡海收复龙湖岛和巡威岛
    【新华社朝鲜前线十一日电】本社前线记者报道：新年的最初几天，在西线发生了更激烈的战斗。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在那里击退了美国侵略军规模更大的疯狂进攻。三日起，在长湍以北智陵洞北山和另一高地的猛烈战斗中，犯敌投入了一个团的兵力。敌军步兵在五个炮群、十余辆战车和多架飞机的掩护下，进行了多次鸭群式的集团冲锋。我军某部用猛烈的炮火和各种自动火力迎击。在激战中敌军几乎每前进一步就要倒下几个，甚至几十个人。敌军曾付出大量伤亡后一度爬上一个山头，但这个山头立即又被我军用猛烈的反击所夺回，大批敌军被打死打伤在寒风凛冽的山岭上。经五个多钟头的激战，我军共计毙伤敌军四百三十多人，迫使敌军狼狈南逃。四日，该地我军某部又和一个多连的犯敌作战，毙伤敌军六十多人。五日，敌军又以一个团的兵力在许多炮群和十多辆战车的配合下，再向我两个高地猛犯；但在我军坚强的阻击下，敌军遭到了同三日一样的惨败。
    在中线，敌军连日在金城、科湖里等地附近以数十至数百人的兵力，向我进行了多次进攻，也都被我军击退，敌军死伤一百三十多人。我军一个班在四日夜间奇袭金城东南一个高地的敌军。勇士们越过了三道铁丝网，在夺得敌军地堡口的一挺机枪后，敌军才仓卒应战。在短促而激烈的战斗中，勇士们将该地一个班的敌军全部歼灭。
    在东线，敌军在二日、三日两天，以一个连至两个连的兵力进攻北汉江以东的一个高地，发起十多次冲锋，都被我强烈火力击退，敌军被打死、打伤六十多人。四日，美国侵略军一个连进犯我军一二一一高地以东，被我毙伤八十多人，其余敌军从积雪很厚的山麓上向南溃退。在西海岸，我海防部队又渡海收复了瓮津以南的龙湖岛和巡威岛。
