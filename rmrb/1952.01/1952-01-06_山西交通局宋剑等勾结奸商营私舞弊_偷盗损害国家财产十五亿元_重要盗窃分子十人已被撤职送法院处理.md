The huge collective embezzlement case of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Transportation Bureau has now been completely solved. A total of seventeen people, including the heads and deputy heads of sections and divisions of the Transportation Bureau, participated in the embezzlement. These embezzlers used various methods to embezzle in an organized and planned manner, causing huge losses to state property. According to the confirmed facts and the confessions of the embezzlers, there were more than 800,000 catties of millet, equivalent to more than 800 million yuan in Renminbi; and there were also untraced stolen materials and materials seized by unscrupulous merchants and damaged by embezzlers, worth about 700 million yuan.

(1) The Situation of Embezzlement
The embezzlers in the Transportation Bureau all used their positions and took advantage of every opportunity to embezzle. For example, in the East Garden warehouse taken over by the Transportation Bureau in 1949, there were many transportation materials, but many were waste products. The Shanxi Provincial Finance and Economics Committee approved the Transportation Bureau to sell the waste products. In the process of selling the waste products, Song Jian, the head of the business section of the Transportation Bureau, Wang Zhaoxiang, the head of the division, Wang Zhenwen, the deputy head of the division, Zhao Yiru, the deputy head of the storage section, and more than ten others used the following methods to embezzle from it.

I. Underreporting sales. For example, selling 133,769 catties of car frames, 11,500 catties of cylinders, and 1,668 catties of iron sheets, each catty was underreported by four taels of rice; selling 6,413 catties of broken iron, each catty was underreported by six taels of rice; selling 2,578 catties of lead plates, each catty was actually sold for four catties of rice, but only four taels of rice were reported. They embezzled 48,795 catties of millet from the above five items.

II. Selling "exclusive products" and "non-saleable items" as "waste products" and embezzling profits from them. For example, selling glycerin twice, the first time was 5,250 kilograms, and each kilogram was underpriced by 31 catties of rice; the second time was 13,286 catties, and each catty was underreported by eight catties of rice. These two items embezzled a total of 269,034 catties of millet. Selling alcohol twice, the first time was 363 catties, and each catty was sold for 15 catties of rice, but only 8.5 catties were reported; the second time was 91 catties, embezzling 1,075 catties of millet. Selling 1,381.5 catties of antimony, embezzling 6,641 catties of millet. They embezzled 279,145.5 catties of millet from the above four items.

III. Reducing the percentage. For example, selling 913 car tires and 51 inner tubes. At that time, the market price was 280 to 300 catties of millet per unit. When selling, it was set at 350 catties of millet per unit, which seemed to be a very high price on the surface; however, the percentage was set very low, and a large amount of embezzlement was carried out.

IV. Colluding with private merchants, accepting bribes from private merchants, and harming public interests for personal gain. They had the closest relationship with the Xiyuan Industrial Institute (tire repair shop). Whenever they sold items, they always notified the Xiyuan Industrial Institute to buy them first. Things that others could not buy from the business office of the Transportation Bureau, the Xiyuan Industrial Institute could not only buy, but also at a particularly cheap price. Sometimes they even took bad goods to the warehouse to exchange for good goods. Zhao Yiru, the deputy head of the storage section, was the first and most frequent recipient of bribes. In a deal to sell 100 car inner tubes and two outer tires to the Xiyuan Industrial Institute, Wang Zhaoxiang, the head of the business division, received a bribe of 50 silver dollars; Qu Xiaohui, the material clerk, received a woolen suit worth 200,000 yuan in Renminbi. Na Weiwen, the warehouse keeper, had used the Xiyuan Industrial Institute's money three times in the name of "loan," each time for 700,000 to 800,000 yuan.

In the procurement and sale of finished products, they used four methods of embezzlement: buying cheap and reporting high, buying less and reporting more, creating fake receipts, and accepting bribes. For example, Zhang Yunbo, the deputy head of the material section, embezzled 9.94 million yuan by overreporting the purchase price of gasoline. For another example, when Song Jian, the head of the business section, and Wang Zhenwen, the deputy head of the division, went to Tianjin to purchase lead wire, they colluded with private merchants to fabricate the documents from Shanghai as Tianjin documents, making the private merchants who handled the matter profit more than 170 million yuan. Song Jian shared 20 million yuan from it, and Wang Zhenwen shared 12 million yuan. Guo Xinming, the director of the business department of the Transportation Bureau Repair Factory, and Li Bencheng, the clerk of the management section, also engaged in malfeasance in the sale and purchase of goods. The two embezzled a total of more than 34 million yuan. When Guo Xinming purchased five tons of pig iron from the Ji'an Trading Company and five tons of ingot iron from the Huimin Trading Company, he received a bribe of 1.6 million yuan and, in the name of a loan, demanded 300,000 yuan and four pounds of wool from the Huimin Trading Company. When Li Bencheng handled the sale of eight cars, he received bribes of more than 1 million to 2 million yuan for each car. When the repair factory purchased cotton yarn and sold the other four cars, Li Bencheng embezzled more than 10 million yuan.

Zhao Yiru, Wang Zhaoxiang and others also collectively stole (it can be said to be "embezzlement by custodians"), Guo Xinming, Bai Lanxuan and others stole and sold public property, and Song Jian and Guo Xinming also engaged in speculation and profiteering.

I. The embezzlers formed three stealing groups, specializing in stealing public property in the warehouse. The Wang Zhaoxiang group stole the most. Wang Zhaoxiang both stole and collected (the things stolen by others had to be handed over to him, and he would distribute 100,000 or 200,000 yuan). He opened a Liangli Factory. The Liangli Factory bought two car frames from the Transportation Bureau, and used the parts stolen by Wang Zhaoxiang to assemble two cars. Wang Zhaoxiang sold these two cars and exchanged them for two good cars for transportation. According to preliminary statistics, the Wang Zhaoxiang group stole a total of 758 car parts; together with their embezzlement in other aspects, it was equivalent to more than 100,000 catties of millet.

The Zhao Yiru group's method was that whoever stole something owned it. Among them, Na Weiwen stole the most. He once took out two boxes of parts by car and moved out a box himself. Taking only ball bearings as an example, he once stole more than 20 plates at a time. He stole inside the bureau, and his mother set up a stall on the street to sell them. The Hao Pei group mainly stole tools, preparing to jointly open a bicycle shop (the case was solved before it was opened). They had stolen 81 tools, equivalent to more than 11,800 catties of millet.

II. There are also several tricks for stealing and selling public property. For example, the warehouse keeper Bai Lanxuan collected 900 catties of broken lead, melted it into large blocks, sold it for 5.4 million yuan, and embezzled it privately. Guo Xinming, the director of the business department, colluded with private merchants to issue fake invoices and resell the public transportation equipment to the public; he also fabricated names and forged seals to steal and sell public equipment.

III. Speculation and profiteering. Two items have been found: one is that Guo Xinming bought two tires from the repair factory at a price of 650,000 yuan, without paying or moving them, and sold them to private merchants for 2 million yuan. The other is that Song Jian, the head of the business section, presided over the contracting of the Water Conservancy Bureau's wooden boards. He could not do it himself, so he subcontracted it to private merchants, trying to obtain 50,000 catties of millet from it. Because the private merchants could not deliver the goods on time, it affected the progress of the water conservancy project, and the Transportation Bureau was punished.

In addition, in order to achieve the purpose of embezzlement, they also destroyed some useful equipment. For example, when Song Jian, Zhao Yiru and others sold 2,578 catties of lead plates, they destroyed more than 100 battery boxes and some complete batteries and sold them as waste lead, and sold a complete motor as waste iron. This caused the state to suffer a loss of 120,000 catties of millet.

All these embezzlers colluded with each other, concealed each other, shielded each other, communicated with each other, and most of them used each other with unscrupulous merchants, colluding with each other, forming an organized "embezzlement group." The relationship between the members of this group exceeded any other relationship. For example, Song Jian, the head of the business section, was originally an alternate member of the Communist Party, but his relationship with Zhao Yiru, Zhang Yunbo and other embezzlers was closer than with any party member. For example, when Zhang Yunbo was discovered by the superior to be suspected of embezzlement in purchasing materials in Tianjin and was left in the personnel section for reflection, Song Jian said that Zhang Yunbo was active in his work and asked to let Zhang Yunbo return to the business office to work. The superior once sent Song Jian to Tianjin to investigate Zhang Yunbo's embezzlement, but Song Jian dragged on for half a year without finding out the truth. The superior sent Na Weiwen to investigate again. Na Weiwen returned from Tianjin and first informed Zhang Yunbo of the situation, causing Zhang Yunbo to abscond. For another example, when Zhao Yiru's embezzlement was exposed and he was detained, Wang Zhaoxiang told his stealing accomplices Han Ruizhen and others: "When things come, stop temporarily." "If the superior asks you, as long as you don't say anything, they won't know." After a few days, he thought it was okay, and said to his accomplices: "Steal again, it's okay." He Bingwu, the manager of the unscrupulous merchant Xiyuan Industrial Institute, also said to the embezzlers: "The public is unreasonable at this time. What can you do if you only earn 200 catties of rice? If you have any difficulties, we can overcome them."

(2) Reasons for the Collective Embezzlement and Theft Incident
The main reason for this embezzlement incident is that the embezzlers and thieves themselves are of very bad character. Among the embezzlers, four were Kuomintang members (Zhao Yiru, Wang Zhaoxiang, Wang Zhenwen, Zhang Yunbo), eight were members of Yan Xishan's comrades, and one was a follower of Yiguandao. Most of them had been embezzling for a long time. Although Song Jian was an alternate member of the Communist Party, he could not stand the test, sought enjoyment, and his thinking degenerated. He had lost the revolutionary quality and became a prisoner of embezzlers and unscrupulous merchants, and became a thief of the people's country.

Secondly, the leading cadres have serious bureaucratic work styles. For example, Huo Qinglin, the director of the Transportation Bureau, when he discovered that Song Jian, Zhao Yiru and others were selling waste iron at low prices (at that time, the central government had instructed to freeze materials for temporary non-disposal), not only did he not immediately stop it, but also introduced his brother Huo Qingzhu (who ran an iron factory) to buy iron three times, a total of 17,650 catties, encroaching on state property worth more than 4,400 catties of millet. In May last year, when the People's Supervision Committee of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government was inspecting the embezzlement incident of the Transportation Bureau, Huo Qinglin introduced Huo Qingzhu to buy a rubber-tired carriage from the Transportation Bureau Repair Factory on credit. Someone offered 6.5 million yuan in cash for this carriage but it was not sold, but Huo Qingzhu bought it for 5.5 million yuan and paid for it half a year later. How can such a person do leadership work and keep the people under his leadership pure?

Huo Qinglin and Deputy Director Zhao Shufu have very serious bureaucratic work styles. The main manifestation is that Song Jian, Zhao Yiru, Wang Zhaoxiang and others have been stealing and embezzling for nearly two years, but they have not discovered it, and they blindly trusted these people and even planned to promote Song Jian. Zhao Yiru had been transferred three times (deputy head of the storage section, deputy head of the business section, deputy head of the management section), but all made him responsible for managing property. During the first inspection of the warehouse in 1949, it was found that 15 new tires and 135 inner tubes were missing, worth about 450,000 catties of millet, but no one was held accountable. After discovering Zhang Yunbo's embezzlement, they did not immediately deal with it, but sent Song Jian and Na Weiwen to Tianjin to investigate, which caused Zhang Yunbo to abscond. These all show that they are 麻痹大意，工作不深入.

They are all careless in their work. For example, after the Shanxi Provincial Finance and Economics Committee issued a decision on selling waste products, they still did not make specific arrangements and strict inspections, so that embezzlers took the opportunity to sell a lot of finished products. At the same time, the Transportation Bureau also lacked the necessary work system. These are all important reasons for the long-term embezzlement and theft phenomenon.

(3) Handling Methods
The opinion of the People's Supervision Committee of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government on handling this case has been approved by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government and the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council:

Song Jian, the head of the business section (who has been stripped of his qualifications as an alternate member of the Communist Party), Zhao Yiru, the deputy head of the storage section, Zhang Yunbo, the deputy head of the material section, Wang Zhaoxiang, the head of the business division, Na Weiwen, the warehouse keeper, Zhang Shouzhi, the warehouse keeper, Han Ruizhen, Guo Xinming, the director of the business department of the repair factory, Li Bencheng, the clerk, and Li Youxian, the material clerk of the printing company (Li Youxian once colluded with Zhao Yiru and Zhang Shouzhi to embezzle) and other ten people were sent to the court for legal action (Zhang Yunbo absconded and has been wanted by the judicial authorities).

Hao Pei, the warehouse keeper, was given a major demerit (the opinion of the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council: Hao Pei should be given a heavier punishment). Liang Yinyu, Liu Dugong, and Chen Zijian were each given a demerit.

Huo Qinglin, the director of the Transportation Bureau, was demoted, and Zhao Shufu, the deputy director, was given a major demerit.

Wang Zhenwen, the deputy head of the business division, Bai Lanxuan, the warehouse keeper, and Qu Xiaohui, the material clerk, were able to truthfully confess and voluntarily return all the赃物 and report other embezzlers, which helped to solve this case, and were exempted from punishment.

He Bingwu, the manager of the unscrupulous merchant Xiyuan Industrial Institute, was handed over to the judicial authorities for legal action.

    山西交通局宋剑等勾结奸商营私舞弊
    偷盗损害国家财产十五亿元
    重要盗窃分子十人已被撤职送法院处理
    山西省人民政府交通局的巨大集体贪污案，现已全部破案。参加贪污的有交通局的正副科长、股长等共十七人。这些贪污分子，采取种种方法，有组织、有计划地进行贪污，使国家财产遭受了巨大的损失。据已查明的和贪污分子供认的，共有八十多万斤小米，折合人民币八亿多元；还有没查清的失盗物资及被奸商侵占和被贪污分子破坏的物资，约值七亿多元。
    （一）贪污的情况
    交通局的贪污分子都是利用职务上的便利，利用一切机会进行贪污的。如一九四九年交通局接管的东花园仓库中有很多交通器材，但废品很多。山西省财政经济委员会批准交通局把废品出卖。在出卖废品的过程中，交通局业务科长宋剑、股长王兆祥、副股长王振文、保管科副科长赵以儒等十多人，运用以下几种方法从中贪污。
    一、卖多报少。如卖汽车架十三万三千七百六十九斤，汽缸一万一千五百斤，铁皮一千六百六十八斤，每斤少报四两米，卖碎铁六千四百一十三斤，每斤少报六两米；卖铅版二千五百七十八斤，每斤实卖四斤米，只报四两米。他们从以上五项物品中，贪污小米四万八千七百九十五斤。
    二、把“专卖品”、“非卖品”也当“废品”出卖，从中贪污取利。如卖甘油两次，第一次五千二百五十公斤，每公斤少报价三十一斤米；第二次一万三千二百八十六斤，每斤少报八斤米。这两项共贪污二十六万九千零三十四斤小米。卖酒精两次，第一次卖三百六十三斤，每斤卖价十五斤米，只报八斤半；第二次出卖酒精九十一斤，从中贪污小米一千零七十五斤。卖锑一千三百八十一斤半，从中贪污小米六千六百四十一斤。他们从以上四项中贪污二十七万九千一百四十五斤半小米。
    三、减低成数。如卖汽车外胎九百一十三条，内胎五十一条，当时市价每成小米二百八十斤至三百斤，出卖时定为每成三百五十斤，表面看来价格很高；但在定成数时，却定得很低，从中大量贪污。
    四、和私商勾结，接受私商贿赂，损公利私。他们和西原工业所（补胎行）关系最密切。每逢出卖物品，总是先通知西原工业所来买。别人从交通局业务处买不到的东西，西原工业所不但能买，而且价钱特别便宜，有时还拿坏货到仓库去换好货。收受贿赂最早最多的是保管科副科长赵以儒。在卖给西原工业所汽车内胎一百条、外胎两条的一次生意中，业务股股长王兆祥得到贿赂白洋五十元；材料员屈效惠得到呢子衣服一身，人民币二十万元。管库员那维文曾用“借款”名义用过西原工业所的三次钱，每次都是七八十万元。
    在采购及出卖成品中，他们使用了四种贪污的方法，即：买贱报贵、买少报多、造假单据、接受贿赂。如材料科副科长张韵波，从多报买进汽油价格中贪污九百九十四万元。又如业务科长宋剑、副股长王振文到天津采购铅丝时，曾串通私商，把在上海买的货物，捏造成天津的单据，使经手的私商获利一亿七千多万元，宋剑从中分得两千万元，王振文分得一千二百万元。交通局修造厂营业部主任郭心明、经营科科员李本诚，也曾在出卖和购买物品中营私舞弊，两人共贪污三千四百多万元。郭心明向济安商行购买生铁五吨、向惠民商行购买元铁五吨时，受贿一百六十万元，并用借款名义，向惠民商行索款三十万元和毛线四磅。李本诚在经手出卖八辆汽车时，每辆都曾收受贿赂一百多万到二百万元。在修造厂购买棉纱及卖出其他的四辆汽车时，李本诚又贪污一千多万元。
    赵以儒、王兆祥等还集体盗窃（可以说是“监守自盗”），郭心明、白兰轩等盗卖公物，宋剑、郭心明并投机倒把。
    一、贪污分子曾组成三个偷盗小组，专门偷盗仓库里的公物。偷盗最多的是王兆祥组。王兆祥又偷又收（别人偷的东西都得交给他，由他分给十万元或二十万元）。他自己开设了一个两利工厂。两利工厂曾买了交通局的两个汽车架，又用王兆祥偷出的零件装成了两辆汽车。王兆祥又把这两辆汽车卖掉，换成两辆好车搞运输。据初步统计，王兆祥组共偷汽车零件七百五十八件；连同他们在其他方面的贪污，折合十万多斤小米。
    赵以儒小组的办法是谁偷归谁。其中偷得最多的是那维文，他一次就用汽车带出零件两箱，自己又搬出一箱。只就滚珠一种来说，一次就曾偷过二十盘。他在局内偷，他母亲就在街上摆摊出卖。郝培小组主要是偷盗工具，准备合伙开一个自行车铺（还没有开成就破了案）。他们已偷出工具八十一件，折合小米一万一千八百多斤。
    二、盗卖公物也有几种花样。如管库员白兰轩把九百斤碎铅收拾起来，溶成大块，卖了五百四十万元，私自吞没。营业部主任郭心明串通私商开假发票，把公家的交通器材再卖给公家；并且还曾捏造人名，刻假图章，盗卖公家器材。
    三、投机倒把。已查出两项：一项是郭心明自己作价六十五万元买了修造厂的轮胎两条，不交款，不移地，就以二百万元卖给私商。另一项是业务科长宋剑主持承包水利局木板，自己本来做不了，转包给私商，企图从中获取五万斤小米。因为私商不能如期交货，影响了水利工程的进行，使交通局受到处罚。
    另外，他们为了达到贪污的目的，还曾破坏了一些有用的器材。如宋剑、赵以儒等出卖二千五百七十八斤铅版时，竟将一百多个电瓶盒子和一部分完整的电瓶破坏了当废铅出卖，并且把一个完整的电动机作废铁出卖。这样就使国家遭受了十二万斤小米的损失。
    所有这些贪污分子，都是互相勾结，互相隐瞒，互相包庇，互通声气，并且大都与奸商互相利用，狼狈为奸，形成一个有组织的“贪污集团”。这个集团内部相互间的关系，超过了任何的其他关系。如业务科长宋剑，本来是中共候补党员，但是他和赵以儒、张韵波等贪污分子的关系，比和任何党员的关系都密切。如张韵波被上级发觉在天津采购物资有贪污嫌疑而被留在人事科反省时，宋剑便说张韵波工作积极，要求让张韵波回业务处工作。上级曾派宋剑到天津调查张韵波的贪污行为，宋剑一直拖了半年，也没有调查出个究竟。上级又派那维文去调查，那维文从天津回来，首先把情况告知张韵波，使张韵波潜逃。再如，当赵以儒的贪污行为被揭发并被扣押后，王兆祥就告诉他的偷窃同伙韩瑞珍等说：“事情到来，暂时停止。”“如果上级问你，只要你不说，他们是不会知道的。”过了几天，他认为没事了，又对他的同伙说：“再偷吧，没事了。”奸商西原工业所的经理和丙午，也曾对贪污分子说过这样的话：“这时公家不讲理，你只能赚二百斤米，够做什么？你有什么困难，咱能克服。”（二）发生集体贪污偷盗事件的原因
    发生这次贪污事件的原因，主要是贪污盗窃分子本身的品质十分恶劣。贪污分子中有四个是国民党员（赵以儒、王兆祥、王振文、张韵波），八个阎匪锡山的同志会员，还有一个一贯道徒。他们多是早已贪污成性。其中宋剑虽是共产党候补党员，但他经不起考验，贪图享受、思想蜕化，已经失掉了革命的品质，做了贪污分子和奸商的俘虏，变成了人民国家的盗贼。
    其次是领导干部有着严重的官僚主义作风。如交通局局长霍清林，当发现宋剑、赵以儒等贱卖废铁时（当时中央已指示冻结物资暂不处理），不但不立即制止，并介绍他的哥哥霍清柱（开铁工厂的）买铁三次，共一万七千六百五十斤，侵占国家财产值四千四百多斤小米。去年五月间，正在山西省人民政府人民监察委员会检查交通局贪污事件的时候，霍清林又介绍霍清柱在交通局修造厂赊购胶皮马车一辆。这辆马车有人给六百五十万元现款没有卖，而霍清柱用五百五十万元买去，并在半年以后才交款。这样的人做领导工作，怎能使他领导下的人员保持纯洁呢？
    霍清林和副局长赵舒甫的官僚主义作风都十分严重。主要表现在宋剑、赵以儒、王兆祥等偷盗贪污已近两年，而他们竟没有发觉，并对这些人员盲目信任，还曾打算提拔宋剑。对赵以儒曾调动过三次工作（保管科副科长、业务科副科长、经营科副科长），但都是使他负责管理财物。在一九四九年第一次检查仓库时，曾发现短少新外胎十五条，内胎一百三十五条，约值小米四十五万斤，但却没有追究。发觉了张韵波的贪污情况后不立即处理，却又派宋剑和那维文到天津调查，而使得张韵波潜逃。这些都说明他们麻痹大意，工作不深入。
    他们在工作中，都是粗枝大叶的。如在山西省财政经济委员会发出关于出卖废品的决定后，他们仍然没有具体布置及严格检查，以致被贪污分子钻空子出卖了很多成品。同时，交通局也缺乏应有的工作制度。这些都是造成长期贪污盗窃现象的重要原因。（三）处理办法
    山西省人民政府人民监察委员会处理这个案件的意见，已经山西省人民政府及中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会批准：
    业务科科长宋剑（已被取消中共候补党员资格）、保管科副科长赵以儒、材料科副科长张韵波、业务股股长王兆祥、管库员那维文、看库员张守志、韩瑞珍、修造厂营业部主任郭心明、科员李本诚、印刷公司材料员李友贤（李友贤曾勾结赵以儒、张守志共同贪污）等十人送法院法办（其中张韵波潜逃，已由司法机关通缉）。
    管库员郝培记大过一次（中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会意见：对郝培应再加重处分）。梁银玉、刘笃功、陈子鉴各记过一次。
    交通局局长霍清林受降职处分，副局长赵舒甫记大过一次。
    业务股副股长王振文及管库员白兰轩、材料员屈效惠，还能真实坦白，把赃物如数自动吐出，并检举其他贪污分子，对破获这一案件有所帮助，免予议处。
    奸商西原工业所经理和丙午由司法机关法办。
