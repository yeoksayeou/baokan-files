    Error of Employees of the Subei Native Produce Branch Business Section Casually Eating and Using Marketed Food Products
    The entire staff of the Business Section of the Subei Native Produce Branch discovered the phenomenon of not distinguishing between public and private interests and casually eating public property during the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement. The native products managed by the company's business section include persimmon cakes, black dates, and honey. In the past, samples of these goods were not kept by a designated person, and some comrades ate and used them casually. The person in charge of the business section saw this phenomenon but did not stop it in time, and even sometimes participated in the snacking themselves. As a result, the bad habit of eating a little leading to eating a lot gradually grew and developed among the cadres. By the time of the inspection, the samples that had been eaten were worth more than 330,000 yuan. After this inspection, not only was this fact revealed, but also the act of wasting state property was criticized among the cadres, and a system of designated personnel to manage samples and conduct inspections was established. I believe that the phenomenon of casually eating public property due to job convenience also exists in other departments, and I hope it will attract attention.　Sun Haiping

    苏北土产分公司业务科职工检查随便吃用经售食品的错误
    苏北土产分公司业务科全体职工，在反贪污浪费运动中，发现了公私不分，随便吃公家东西的现象。公司业务科所经营的土产有柿饼、黑枣、蜂蜜等。这些货物的样品过去没有专人保管，一部分同志随便吃用。业务科负责同志看见这种现象，不但没有及时制止，甚至有时自己也参加小吃。因此，由小吃到大吃的不良风气，便在干部中逐渐滋长和发展，到检查时为止，被吃掉的样品约合三十三万多元。经过这次检查后，不但揭露了这种事实，同时在干部中批判了这种浪费国家财产的行为，订立了专人保管样品和检查的制度。我认为像这种因工作之便随便吃公家东西的现象，在其他部门也一定还有，希望能够引起注意。　孙海萍
