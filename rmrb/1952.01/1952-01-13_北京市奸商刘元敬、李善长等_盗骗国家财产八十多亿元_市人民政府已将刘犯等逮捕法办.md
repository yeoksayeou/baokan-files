    [This News] The unscrupulous merchants Liu Yuanjing, Li Shanchang, and others in Beijing, driven by greed for exorbitant profits, colluded with each other, jeopardized military construction, and embezzled and defrauded the state of over 8 billion yuan. They have been arrested and brought to justice by the Municipal Public Security Bureau.
    Liu Yuanjing is an extremely cunning and despicable unscrupulous merchant. After the liberation of Beijing, he feigned active progress, became the chairman of the Beijing Construction Industry Association, an executive member of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, and a representative of the people from all walks of life in the city. For more than three years, despite the patient help and education he received from the People's Government and relevant parties, he stubbornly refused to abandon his evil habits of deception and theft. In 1950, he and eight construction firms, including Yuxing, Yude, Dagong, and Juxingyong, contracted for a military construction project in a certain area, with a total contract price of over 28.5 billion yuan. Instead of fulfilling their responsibilities and completing this significant national defense construction task entrusted to them by the state, Liu Yuanjing and the other eight unscrupulous merchants saw this as a golden opportunity to get rich. They colluded with each other to seek exorbitant profits, not hesitating to sabotage the national defense construction project. They inflated contract prices in the unit price, underreported the quantity of work, and cut corners in the quality of the project, embezzling and defrauding the state of a total of over 8 billion yuan. All the projects contracted by these unscrupulous merchants failed to meet standards. The newly built water tower has already tilted, many buildings have collapsed, all doors and windows have cracked, the roofs of fifteen houses leak, and half of the electrical engineering is experiencing electrical leakage, causing huge losses to state property. To achieve their despicable goal of embezzling and defrauding state property, the criminals Liu Yuanjing, etc., bribed acceptance personnel with huge sums of money. Many workers who participated in the construction project were indignant at the extremely despicable and evil illegal acts of the criminals Liu Yuanjing, etc., and reported them to the People's Government in various ways.
    After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched in Beijing, although the Municipal People's Government and the Federation of Industry and Commerce repeatedly called on industrialists and businessmen who had engaged in bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property to quickly and thoroughly confess their crimes, the criminal Liu Yuanjing pretended to be calm and feigned activity, determined not to confess. At the Third Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, the criminal Liu Yuanjing even hypocritically said in his speech: "The phenomenon of bribery in the construction industry is very common. The result of bribery is that the country's basic construction projects suffer serious losses. We must strive to transform our construction industry in this movement." This was actually just a deceptive trick of a thief crying "stop thief." Because the criminal Liu Yuanjing was the chairman of the Construction Industry Association, he showed an "active" attitude everywhere after the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement began in the industrial and commercial circles. At the various meetings of the industrial and commercial sector's frugality inspection sub-committee, he said that he held large and small meetings of industry members every day and presided over reports every night. However, in reality, the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in the construction industry was not carried out very well, and less than half of those who voluntarily and thoroughly confessed and reported corruption and bribery. In order to win Liu Yuanjing's confession, Fu Huating, chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, had several individual conversations with him and asked him to make a typical speech, taking the lead in confessing his illegal acts. However, he deliberately delayed and refused to confess. It was not until the 11th that he admitted that he had bribed cadres with more than 100,000 yuan, with the aim of trying to muddle through. The other unscrupulous merchants also repeatedly refused to confess, or confessed very incompletely.
    Despite the extreme cunning and hypocrisy of the criminal Liu Yuanjing, which fully demonstrated the despicable and evil nature of unscrupulous merchants, the Municipal Frugality Inspection Committee had already received materials reporting him and the other unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, after the criminal Liu Yuanjing and others repeatedly refused to confess and were unwilling to repent, the Municipal Frugality Inspection Committee, because the facts were clear and the evidence was conclusive, requested the Municipal People's Government to arrest Liu Yuanjing, Li Shanchang (manager of Dagong Construction Company), Shen Jingchun (manager of Yude Construction Company), Wan Xuanzhi (manager of Yuxing Construction Company), and Jiao Guorong (manager of Juxingyong Construction Company) and hand them over to the People's Court for punishment according to law.
    On the evening of the 12th, Liu Ren, director of the Municipal Frugality Inspection Committee, specially invited Fu Huating and other vice-chairmen of the Federation of Industry and Commerce to a meeting and announced on the spot that the Municipal Government had arrested the criminal Liu Yuanjing and others. Director Liu Ren pointed out in his speech that the criminal Liu Yuanjing was an extremely cunning and hypocritical unscrupulous merchant. Although the People's Government had repeatedly given him the opportunity to confess, he dared to defy the law and resolutely refused to confess. The People's Government's arrest and punishment of the criminal Liu Yuanjing and others is entirely in line with the interests of the broad masses of the people. He also hoped that the Federation of Industry and Commerce would continue to mobilize and educate the industrial and commercial circles and carry out the movement against corruption, bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property. Except for those who are guilty of heinous crimes, the government will be lenient with those who sincerely repent. Fu Huating and Ling Qijun spoke successively, unanimously supporting the decision to arrest the criminal Liu Yuanjing and others, and expressing their intention to continue to deeply develop the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in the industrial and commercial circles.

    北京市奸商刘元敬、李善长等
    盗骗国家财产八十多亿元
    市人民政府已将刘犯等逮捕法办
    【本报讯】北京市奸商刘元敬、李善长等贪图暴利，互相勾结，危害军事建设，盗骗国家财产达八十多亿元，已由市公安局逮捕法办。
    刘元敬是一个极端狡猾和卑鄙无耻的不法商人。北京解放后，他伪装积极进步，当上了北京市营造业公会的主任委员，又是北京市工商业联合会的执行委员和工商界所选的市各界人民代表会议的代表。三年多来，他虽然受到人民政府和有关方面的耐心帮助和教育，却仍然不肯丢掉自己的欺骗、偷盗等恶习。一九五○年，他和裕兴、裕德、大功、聚兴永等八家营造厂承包了某地军事建筑工程，总包价为二百八十五亿多元。刘元敬等八家奸商非但不尽自己的职责，来完成国家所委托给他们的这一国防建设的重大任务，反而认为这是他们发财的大好机会，互相勾结谋取暴利，不惜破坏国防建设工程。他们在承包单价上抬高包价，在工程数量上以少报多，在工程质量上则偷工减料，总共盗骗国家资财达八十多亿元之巨。这些不法商人所承包的全部工程不合标准。新修水塔现已倾斜，不少房地已下塌，全部门窗发生裂缝，有十五幢房屋的房顶漏雨，全部电气工程有二分之一跑电，使国家资财蒙受巨大损失。刘犯元敬等为了达到盗骗国家资财的卑鄙目的，曾以巨款向验收人员行贿。对于刘犯元敬等这些极端卑鄙恶劣的犯法行为，参加修建工程的许多职工都很愤慨，曾经用各种方式向人民政府检举告发。
    在北京市展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动后，虽然市人民政府和工商联，一再号召有行贿、偷税和盗窃国家资财的工商业者迅速彻底地坦白自己的犯罪行为，但是刘犯元敬却故作镇静，假装积极，抱定不坦白的“决心”。在北京市第三届第三次各界人民代表会议上，刘犯元敬在大会发言中更虚伪地说：“营造业行贿的现象是很普遍的。行贿的结果，使国家的基本建设工程遭受严重的损失。我们一定要在这个运动中努力改造我们营造业。”这实际上不过是一种贼喊捉贼的欺骗手法而已。刘犯元敬因为是营造业公会的主任委员，在工商界的反贪污反行贿运动开始后，随处都表现出一副“积极”的姿态。在工商界节约检查分会的历次会议上，都说他每天召开行业会员的大会小会，并且每天晚上都主持汇报。但是实际上营造业的反贪污反行贿运动作得十分不好，自动彻底坦白和检举贪污行贿行为的人尚不到一半。工商联主任委员傅华亭为了争取刘犯元敬坦白，曾经数次找他个别谈话，并要他作典型发言，带头把自己的违法行为交代清楚。而他则故意拖延，坚不坦白。直到十一日为止，他才承认自己曾向干部行贿十多万元，其目的是想借此蒙混过去。其余的几家奸商也同样一再拒不坦白，或者坦白得很不彻底。
    尽管刘犯元敬这样极端狡猾和虚伪，充分表现了不法商人的卑鄙恶劣的本质，但是市节约检查委员会早已接到检举他和其余几家奸商的材料。因此在刘犯元敬等一再不肯坦白，不愿改过自新以后，市节约检查委员会因为事实俱在，证据确切，即请市人民政府将刘元敬、李善长（大功营造厂经理）、沈景春（裕德营造厂经理）、万选之（裕兴营造厂经理）和焦国荣（聚兴永营造厂经理）五人逮捕，送交人民法院依法惩办。
    十二日晚，市节约检查委员会主任刘仁，特邀请工商联正副主任委员傅华亭等开会，当场宣布市府已逮捕了刘犯元敬等。刘仁主任在发言中特别指出：刘犯元敬是一个极端狡猾、虚伪的不法商人，虽然人民政府已经一再给了坦白的机会，但他竟敢以身试法，坚决不肯坦白。人民政府将刘犯元敬等逮捕法办，是完全符合广大人民的利益的。他并希望工商联继续不断地向工商界进行动员教育，开展反贪污、反行贿、反偷税和反对盗骗国家资财的运动。除罪大恶极者外，凡真诚悔改者，政府均将从宽处理。傅华亭和凌其峻等相继发言，一致拥护关于逮捕刘犯元敬等的决定，并表示要继续在工商界中深入开展反贪污反行贿运动。
