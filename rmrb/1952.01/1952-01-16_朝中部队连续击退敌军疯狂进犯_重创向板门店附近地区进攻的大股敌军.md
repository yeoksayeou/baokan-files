Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 15th: Our frontline correspondent reports: While the American representatives shamelessly clamor at the negotiation table to continue the debate with cannons, bombs, and bullets, large enemy forces frantically advancing towards the Jiryeong-dong area, eight kilometers east of Panmunjom, have been battered and bloodied. Since last month, the American aggressors have not ceased their attacks or incursions in the vicinity of Panmunjom for a single day, seriously threatening the safety of the conference site. On December 28th of last year, an enemy regiment launched a frenzied attack on the Jiryeong-dong area, but was repulsed by a unit of our army stationed there. From the 6th to the 8th of this month, a unit of our army again repulsed continuous attacks by five companies to two battalions of enemy troops on Buksan in Jiryeong-dong and nearby mountains. The enemy's intended goal was to occupy this area, but as a result, they were beaten back to their starting point of invasion, and they threw away the corpses and wounded soldiers of many of their soldiers in the biting cold snow. In a battle on the evening of the 7th, a unit of our army killed or wounded more than 580 invading enemies. On the 10th, two companies of enemy troops again launched a sneak attack on our Buksan position in Jiryeong-dong, and were fiercely bombarded by our artillery units. More than 70 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded.

The U.S. 45th Division, newly transferred from Japan and thrown into the western front, suffered its first head-on blow from our army in its attacks on the Seongsan area west of Cheorwon on the 29th of last month and the 9th of this month. The British 29th Brigade, which suffered heavy losses during the enemy's autumn offensive, recently used several small groups of troops to harass the area near Cheongting-ri, north of Gorangpo-ri, and as a result, a unit of our army killed or wounded most of them.

On the eastern front, enemy attacks on mountainous areas near Mundeung-ri and Seoksa-ri were also repulsed by a unit of our army. On the 6th, two companies of U.S. troops, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked an unnamed high ground east of Mundeung-ri. A unit of our army fought fiercely with these enemy troops for two and a half hours, repelling them and killing or wounding more than 120 enemies. In a certain area, a unit of our army repelled an attack by a company of enemy troops at the cost of only one person being wounded, killing or wounding more than 50 enemy soldiers. On the central front, a unit of our army also repelled many enemy attacks and incursions, eliminating a large number of enemy personnel.

    朝中部队连续击退敌军疯狂进犯
    重创向板门店附近地区进攻的大股敌军
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】本社前线记者报道：当美方代表在谈判会议桌上无耻叫嚣用大炮、炸弹和子弹继续辩论的时候，向板门店以东八公里智陵洞地区疯狂进犯的大股敌军却被打得头破血流。美国侵略者自上月份以来，没有一天停止过对板门店附近地区的进攻或窜扰，严重地威胁着会议地点的安全。去年十二月二十八日，敌军一个团开始向智陵洞地区发动疯狂进攻，但被守卫在该地的我军某部所击退。自本月六日到八日的三天中，我军某部又在智陵洞北山和附近山地打退敌军五个连到两个营的连续进攻。敌军预定的目标是想侵占这个地区，但结果仍旧被打回到他们进犯的出发地，并狼狈地把他们许多士兵的尸体和伤兵抛弃在寒风刺骨的雪地里。在七日晚间的一次战斗中，我军某部毙伤犯敌五百八十多人。十日，两个连的敌军又偷袭我智陵洞北山阵地，遭到我炮兵部队的猛烈轰击，敌军被打死打伤七十多人。
    已被抛入西线战斗的新从日本增调来的美军第四十五师，在上月二十九日和本月九日向铁原以西城山地区的进攻中，初次遭到我军的迎头痛击。曾在敌军秋季攻势中遭到惨重损失的英军第二十九旅，最近曾用数小股兵力窜扰高浪浦里以北青廷里附近地区，结果被我军某部杀伤大部。
    在东线，敌军进犯文登里、石寺里等附近山地，也都被我军某部击退。六日，美军两个连在炮火掩护下进攻文登里以东的一个无名高地。我军某部和这股敌军激战两个半小时，将敌军击退，毙伤敌一百二十多人。我军某部在某地仅以一个人负伤的代价击退一个连敌军的进攻，毙伤敌军五十多人。中线，我军某部也打退了敌军许多次的进攻和窜扰，消灭了敌军大量有生力量。
