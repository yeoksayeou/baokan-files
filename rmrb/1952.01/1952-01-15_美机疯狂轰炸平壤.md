Xinhua News Agency, January 14th dispatch from Pyongyang: While the American aggressors are dragging out the Korean armistice negotiations, American planes are even more frantically bombing and slaughtering the Korean people. According to a TASS dispatch from Pyongyang, in the first week of 1952, American bombers and jet fighters frantically bombed Pyongyang and its surrounding areas day and night. American planes dropped a total of approximately 500 explosive and incendiary bombs on the city and its suburbs. As a result of the barbaric bombing by American planes, many houses in Pyongyang were destroyed, and more than 70 people were killed or injured, mainly women and children.

In the past year, the American air force has carried out approximately two thousand air raids on Pyongyang, involving more than five thousand aircraft of various types. Bombers and fighters have dropped a total of approximately 42,000 explosive, fragmentation, and incendiary bombs on the city.

Excluding the suburbs, an average of approximately one thousand bombs were dropped per square kilometer in the urban area of Pyongyang.

The American plane bombings on July 30th and August 14th of last year were particularly barbaric and inhumane. At that time, a total of 820 aircraft bombed the city, including 100 Flying Fortresses that took off from airfields in Japan. Since September 1951, American night bombers have been blindly dropping explosive and incendiary bombs on the city every night.

The US military command hoped in the past, and still hopes now, to destroy peaceful residents and dispel the courage of the Korean people through their indiscriminate bombing. However, the aggressors have miscalculated, because no matter how terrible the barbaric crimes are, they can never make the Korean people submit.

    美机疯狂轰炸平壤
    【新华社十四日讯】在美国侵略者拖延朝鲜停战谈判期间，美方飞机更加疯狂地轰炸屠杀朝鲜人民。据塔斯社平壤讯：一九五二年的第一个星期中，美国轰炸机和喷气式战斗机不分昼夜地疯狂轰炸平壤及其四郊。美国飞机向市区及其四郊投下了共约五百枚爆炸弹和燃烧弹。由于美国飞机野蛮轰炸的结果，平壤许多房屋被炸毁了，死伤了七十多人，主要的是妇女和小孩。
    过去一年间，美国空军空袭平壤约两千次，参加的各种类型的飞机有五千多架。轰炸机和战斗机一共向市区投下了约四万二千枚爆炸弹、杀伤弹和燃烧弹。
    除郊区外，在平壤市区平均每一平方公里就被投下了约一千枚的炸弹。
    去年七月三十日和八月十四日美机的轰炸特别野蛮而惨无人道。当时共计有八百二十架飞机向市区投弹轰炸，其中一百架是从日本飞机场上起飞的飞行堡垒。从一九五一年九月以来，美国夜袭轰炸机每天夜里向市区盲目投掷爆炸弹和燃烧弹。
    美军司令部过去希望，现在仍然希望凭借他们的狂轰滥炸，来毁灭和平居民和打消朝鲜人民的勇气。然而，侵略者估计错了，因为无论多么可怖的野蛮罪行，永远也不能使朝鲜人民屈膝。
