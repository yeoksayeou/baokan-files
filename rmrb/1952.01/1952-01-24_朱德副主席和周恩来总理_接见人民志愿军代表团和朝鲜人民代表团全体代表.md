Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government and Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council received all representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation and the Korean People's Visit Delegation at 4:00 PM on the 23rd at Huairentang.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation and the Korean People's Visit Delegation were accompanied by Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission, and Liu Guanyi, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, respectively.

In his speech during the reception, Vice Chairman Zhu said to all representatives: "The people of all of China are looking forward to seeing you and welcome and respect you from the bottom of their hearts. Because you are representatives of the heroic Korean people and representatives of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army." After recounting the victories of the Chinese and Korean peoples, Vice Chairman Zhu said: "Your great victory has raised the political consciousness of the people of China and the world, helped the people of all countries in their struggle for peace and democracy, and strengthened the strength of the world anti-aggression camp headed by the Soviet Union. The American imperialists who launched the war of aggression have suffered significant losses and are becoming more and more isolated at home and abroad. This change in the world situation, which is favorable to us and unfavorable to the enemy, is continuing to develop." Vice Chairman Zhu concluded: "We must continue our heroic and steadfast struggle. If the aggressors do not cease their aggression against us, our struggle will never end. We will surely defeat the barbaric and tyrannical American aggressors, and our struggle for peace and justice will surely be victorious."

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech: "On behalf of all the Chinese people, I warmly welcome you, the heroic representatives of the Korean people and the heroic representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, to come to and return to China. China and Korea are as close as lips and teeth. In the past thirty years, the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people has received heroic assistance from Korean comrades. The Chinese people have a deep friendship for the fraternal country of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Therefore, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people volunteered to go to Korea and fight alongside the Korean People's Army, forming this historically unforgettable friendship." Premier Zhou Enlai said: "I congratulate you on your victory and wish you even greater victories."

Hong Sun-chol, head of the Korean People's Visit Delegation, delivered a reply. He said, "The friendship forged with blood and flesh between our two peoples will become more united and consolidated through our work."
