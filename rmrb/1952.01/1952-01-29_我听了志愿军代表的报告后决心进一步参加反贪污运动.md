    After listening to the report of the Volunteer Army representatives, I resolved to further participate in the anti-corruption movement
    Editor: On the 23rd, I didn't sleep well all night, wondering: How will I meet the Volunteer Army comrades tomorrow?
    The next day, like everyone else, I quietly listened to the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army representatives returning from Korea. I was moved to tears listening to Comrade Xi Ning's report. I heard her cough in the report. Every time she coughed, I got anxious. During the break, I went outside and bought a box of cough drops for her. She handed me a notebook and asked me to sign it. I really didn't know what to write. After I finished writing, she held my hand tightly and said, "Thank you!" These three words will be forever etched in my heart, because this is the first time I have spoken to the "most lovable people"!
    I will definitely learn from their spirit of hard work and self-sacrifice, and further participate in the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement.

    我听了志愿军代表的报告后决心进一步参加反贪污运动
    编辑同志：二十三日通宵我没有睡好觉，心中在想：明日怎样和志愿军同志们见面。
    第二天，我和大家一样，静静地听着志愿军归国代表所讲的自己的英勇事迹。我听了洗宁同志的报告，感动得流了眼泪。在报告中，我听到她咳嗽的声音。她一咳嗽，我便着急。在休息时，我到外面买了一盒止咳糖送给她，她顺手递给我一本笔记本，要我在上面签字，我真不知要写些什么。写完后，她紧紧地握住我的手说：“谢谢你！”这三个字，将会永远记在我的心眼里，因为，这还是我第一次和“最可爱的人”说话呢！
    我一定学习他们艰苦奋斗和自我牺牲的精神，进一步参加反贪污、反行贿运动。
