Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 24th. Tass, Tokyo, January 22nd: Recently, many news reports in Japanese newspapers have discussed the outrage among people of all strata in Japan caused by the US occupation headquarters' use of crude pressure on the Japanese government regarding military spending appropriations in the Japanese budget for the 1952-1953 fiscal year. As everyone knows, the US, having already imposed the US-Japan military agreement—the so-called "Security Treaty"—on Japan on September 8, 1951, has burdened Japan with the unbearable expenses of rearmament and maintaining US troops stationed in Japan and US military bases in Japan.

At the request of Soviet Commissioner Major General Kislenko, the Allied Council for Japan convened a special meeting on January 17th. At the special meeting, Kislenko raised the following inquiry:

"According to a report in the 'Japan Times' on January 9, 1952, on January 7th, the Japanese government requested the Allied Headquarters to approve the appropriation for expenses related to the so-called US-Japan joint defense in the 1952-1953 fiscal year, that is, expenses for maintaining US armed forces stationed in Japan, including expenses for the Police Reserve Force, etc., totaling 221 billion yen. In response, the Allied Headquarters insisted on an appropriation of 250 billion yen for the aforementioned expenses and rejected the Japanese government's request.

Because such unnecessary spending by Japan will mean a further rise in grain and commodity prices, a decline in the real wages of workers and staff, and an increase in taxes for farmers and urban residents, in other words, it will affect the basic and vital interests of all Japanese people, the chairman should answer the following questions: Is the aforementioned statement in the Japanese newspaper factual? What is the Allied Headquarters' opinion on the aforementioned news in the 'Japan Times'?"

The chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, US Commissioner Sebald, avoided answering the substance of the Soviet Commissioner's inquiry and merely repeated the same old slanders, in addition to saying some irrelevant things about the Soviet Union supposedly not repatriating Japanese prisoners of war.

It must be pointed out that despite the efforts of the US occupation authorities to force Japanese newspapers not to publish Kislenko's inquiry, most Japanese newspapers have published the entire inquiry.

Xinhua News Agency, January 24th. Tokyo dispatch: The draft general accounting budget for the 1952 fiscal year (from April 1st this year to March 31st next year), compiled by the Yoshida traitorous government based on the instructions of US Detroit banker Dodge, was approved by Ridgway Headquarters on the 17th. According to this draft budget, Japan's revenue and expenditure for 1952 are both 852.7 billion yen (360 yen equals one US dollar). This budget is the largest in post-war Japan, and it is entirely for the purpose of implementing the US plan to intensify the rearmament of Japan after the separate peace treaty. Even Kyodo News had to admit: This budget indicates that Japan has openly "embarked on the first step of rearmament."

Of all the expenditures in this budget, the largest item is the direct military expenditure concealed under the name of "temporary expenses." This expenditure totals 229 billion yen, accounting for more than 26 percent of the total expenditures. According to the Associated Press, quoting Japanese government sources, the Yoshida government originally stipulated that the "temporary expenses" would be 221 billion yen, but "Ridgway Headquarters wanted them to increase it to 250 billion yen." The current 229 billion yen is a "compromise figure."

In the "temporary expenses," apart from a small portion that will be used for compensation, the vast majority is military appropriations. 65 billion yen will be used to maintain the US occupation forces continuing to be stationed in Japan under the US-Japan "Security Treaty." This huge sum is essentially the "post-war settlement expenses" (i.e., "occupation expenses") before the separate peace treaty. In the past six years, the Japanese people have been squeezed for 4.974 billion US dollars in "post-war settlement expenses." These war preparation expenses used to maintain the US occupation forces and build military bases have not been cancelled because of the signing of the separate peace treaty.

Another major expenditure in the "temporary expenses" is the cost of expanding Japan's military power. 54 billion yen is allocated to strengthen the disguised new army of Japan—the "Police Reserve Force." According to Kyodo News, the Yoshida government is prepared to first increase the "Police Reserve Force" by 25,000 personnel in the first half of this year, and then increase it by 50,000 personnel in October, totaling an increase of 75,000 personnel, doubling the existing quota of the "Police Reserve Force." According to the "Japan Armament Expansion Two-Year Plan" formulated by the US Department of Defense, Japan must first establish an army of 150,000 men this year.

The funds allocated to the "Maritime Safety Agency" are more than 8.6 billion yen. According to Kyodo News, 7 billion yen will be used entirely to increase the agency's personnel by 5,000 and other measures to strengthen its power. The "Maritime Safety Agency" is planning to "rent" ten escort frigates and fifty small ships from the United States.

There is also an item of so-called "various security expenses" in the "temporary expenses" amounting to 56 billion yen, the specific purpose of which has not been specified. Kyodo News admits: This huge sum is "defense (!) expenses in a broad sense, and has the nature of preparatory expenses." When the expenses related to maintaining the US occupation forces, the "Police Reserve Force," and the "Maritime Safety Agency" are insufficient, "it can be misappropriated."

The military expenses in the Japanese budget are not limited to the various items in the "temporary expenses." As everyone knows, the Japanese government has always hidden some military expenses in appropriations such as "public works expenses." According to the draft budget for 1952, "public works expenses" amount to 20 billion yen.

The Yoshida government's huge military spending will inevitably further increase the already very heavy burden on the Japanese people. According to Kyodo News, the total amount of various national taxes, including stamp duties, in 1952 is expected to be more than 630 billion yen, an increase of about 13 percent compared with 1951. Kyodo News admits: The direct military expenditure in the "temporary expenses" "can be said to contain a severely significant figure that determines the fate of the Japanese people." Moreover, the US measures to rearm Japan "will increase next year compared to this year, and the year after will increase compared to next year. The proportion of butter and cannons, the focus shifting from butter to cannons, this situation will continue regardless of the lives of the people." Yoshida shamelessly announced in the Budget Committee of the Senate on November 27 last year that the US and Japanese reactionaries will continue to attack the living standards of the Japanese people, saying: According to Japan's future financial situation, the lives of the Japanese people "will still be quite difficult," and even "will be more bitter than in Britain." However, there is no doubt that this reactionary policy of the US and Japanese reactionaries, which desperately squeezes the Japanese people to intensify the rearmament of Japan, will be met with even stronger opposition from the Japanese people.

### 美国占领军批准吉田政府庞大备战预算  基斯连科向美国提出严正质询  指出美国强迫日本增加军事开支，势必影响全体日本人民的基本的切身利益

    美国占领军批准吉田政府庞大备战预算
    基斯连科向美国提出严正质询
    指出美国强迫日本增加军事开支，势必影响全体日本人民的基本的切身利益
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社东京二十二日讯：最近，日本报纸发表了许多消息，谈到美国占领军总部为了日本一九五二—一九五三会计年度预算中的军事开支拨款对日本政府施用粗暴压力一事在日本各阶层人民中所引起的愤慨。大家知道，美国既已在一九五一年九月八日把美日军事协定——所谓“安全条约”——强加于日本，就使日本负担了重新武装、维持驻日美军和美国在日本的军事基地的难以负担的开支。
    盟国对日委员会应苏联委员基斯连科少将之请，在一月十七日召开了特别会议。基斯连科在特别会议上提出了如下的询问：
    “根据一九五二年一月九日‘日本时报’的消息，在一月七日，日本政府请求盟总批准一九五二—一九五三会计年度的与所谓美日联防有关的开支的拨款，那就是，维持美国驻日武装部队的开支，其中包括警察后备队等等的开支，总数是二千二百一十亿日元。在答复时，盟总坚持拨款二千五百亿日元作为上述的开支，并拒绝了日本政府的请求。
    因为日本通过这种毫无必要的开支将意味着粮价和日用品价格的进一步上涨、工人和职员实际工资的下降以及农民和都市居民赋税的增加，换句话说，也就是将影响全体日本人民的基本的切身利益，所以，主席理应答复下列问题：上述的日本报纸的说法是否合乎事实？盟总对于上述‘日本时报’的消息的意见如何？”
    盟国对日委员会主席、美国委员赛鲍尔避免答复苏联委员询问的实质，而只是重复老一套的诽谤，此外还说了一些牛头不对马嘴的话，说什么苏联延不遣返日本战俘。
    必须指出的是：尽管美国占领当局努力迫使日本报纸不发表基斯连科的询问，但大多数日本报纸已把这一询问全部刊载出来了。
    【新华社二十四日讯】东京消息：日本吉田卖国政府根据美国底特律银行家道奇的指示而编制的一九五二会计年度（今年四月一日到明年三月三十一日）一般会计预算草案，已在十七日由李奇微总部批准。根据这一预算草案，日本一九五二年度的岁出和岁入均为八千五百二十七亿日元（三百六十日元合一美元），这一预算是战后日本最庞大的预算，它完全是为了执行美国在单独媾和后加紧重新武装日本的计划的，连共同社亦不得不承认：这个预算表示日本已公开“踏上了重新武装的第一步。”
    在这一预算的全部岁出中，最大的一项是在“临时费”名目掩盖下的直接军费支出，这项费用共达二千二百九十亿日元，占全部岁出的百分之二十六以上。据美联社引日本政府人士说：吉田政府原来规定“临时费”为二千二百一十亿日元，“李奇微总部要他们增加为二千五百亿日元”。现在的二千二百九十亿日元是一个“折衷数目”。
    在“临时费”中，除了一小部分将用于赔偿以外，绝大部分都是军事性的拨款。其中有六百五十亿日元将用于维持根据美日“安全条约”继续留驻日本的美国占领军，这笔巨额款项，实质上就是单独媾和以前的“终战处理费”（即“占领费”）。在过去六年中，日本人民已被榨取“终战处理费”四十九亿七千四百万美元。这些用来维持美国占领军和修建军事基地的备战费用，并没有因为单独和约的签订而被取消。
    “临时费”中的另一主要支出是关于扩张日本武力的费用。五百四十亿日元被规定用来加强日本变相的新陆军——“警察后备队”。据共同社透露，吉田政府已准备在今年上半年先增加“警察后备队”人员二万五千名，到十月间再增加五万名，合计增加七万五千名，较现有的“警察后备队”名额增加一倍。根据美国国防部制订的“日本扩军两年计划”，日本首先要在今年建立一支十五万人的陆军。
    拨给“海上保安厅”的款项是八十六亿多日元。据共同社透露，其中七十亿日元将全部用于增加该厅人员五千名以及其他加强力量的措施方面。“海上保安厅”正在计划向美国“租借”护航快舰十艘和小型舰艇五十艘。
    “临时费”中还有一项数达五百六十亿日元的所谓“各项安全保障费”，未被指明确定的用途。共同社承认：这笔巨款“就是广义的防卫（！）费，具有准备费的性质”。在有关维持美国占领军、“警察后备队”和“海上保安厅”的费用不敷时，“都可以挪用”。
    日本预算中的军事性费用，并不仅限于“临时费”中的各项而已。大家知道，日本政府一向把一些军事性的费用隐藏在“公共事业费”等拨款中。根据一九五二年度的预算草案，“公共事业费”达二百亿日元。
    吉田政府的庞大军事费用的支出，势将更加加重日本人民已经十分沉重的负担。据共同社透露，一九五二年度的包括印花税在内的各项国家捐税的总额，预计要征收到六千三百多亿日元，比一九五一年度增加百分之十三左右。共同社承认：“临时费”中的直接军费，“可以说是包藏着决定日本人民命运的形势严重的数字”。而且，美国重新武装日本的措施，“明年要比今年增加，后年要比明年增加。牛油和大炮的比重，重点从牛油转向大炮，这种情形将不顾国民的生活进行下去。”吉田于去年十一月二十七日在参议院预算委员会上已经无耻地宣布美、日反动派将继续向日本人民的生活水准进攻，他说：根据日本今后的财政情况，日本人民的生活“还有相当的艰苦”，甚至“将比英国更苦些”。但是，美、日反动派这一拚命压榨日本人民以加紧重新武装日本的反动政策，必将遭受日本人民更强烈的反对，这是毫无疑问的。
