Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce convened an emergency meeting of heads of various trade associations on the 8th to mobilize those who have committed bribery to immediately and thoroughly confess, in order to deeply carry out the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement.

After brief speeches by Fu Huating, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Wang Minsheng, Chairman of the New Pharmaceutical Trade Association, the meeting broke into groups for confession.

In his mobilization report, Fu Huating pointed out: Although the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles has become a household name, and many problems have been confessed, there is a relatively common phenomenon of confessing small matters but not large ones in the confessed problems. This phenomenon must be quickly changed in order to deepen the movement. Fu Huating said: "From today onwards, the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee will conduct inspections. If bribery is found and not confessed, it will be punished according to law. I hope that industrial and commercial operators with problems will catch up quickly, those who have not confessed should confess quickly, and those whose confessions are not thorough should immediately supplement their materials." He said: "The two different treatments of the nine major embezzlement and smuggling criminals by the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration are the best lessons for the industrial and commercial circles." Finally, Fu Huating called on the leaders of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and various industry trade associations who have committed bribery to seize the opportunity and take the lead in today's meeting to confess all the problems that should be confessed without any ambiguity. He said: "Originally, confession is a very simple matter, it is a question of being loyal and honest or not, a question of speaking or not speaking, and there is no need for any persuasion or mobilization. If you have committed bribery or other criminal acts, you know it yourself, and you should quickly and thoroughly confess in order to obtain lenient treatment from the People's Government, reduce the punishment for serious crimes, and reduce or exempt the punishment for minor crimes. There is nothing worth hesitating or waiting to see."

Wang Minsheng, Chairman of the New Pharmaceutical Trade Association, cited the example of a committee member of the association being reported by an employee, illustrating that seizing the opportunity, taking the initiative to confess, and making a thorough confession is the best opportunity for industrial and commercial operators with bribery and other illegal acts to reform themselves. Otherwise, they will test the law, and then it will be too late to regret.

At today's meeting, 596 chairmen, vice-chairmen, and standing committee members of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, district offices, and 135 trade associations attended, and confessed in ten groups in oral or written form. A total of 349 people confessed to 747 cases, of which 297 cases were newly confessed in addition to those supplementing materials.

The Beijing Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee originally scheduled to begin inspections today. The Standing Committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce earnestly requested a three-day extension to give those in the industrial and commercial circles who have committed bribery but have not yet confessed a final opportunity to confess before conducting inspections. This request has been approved by Peng Zhen, Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government.

    京工商联召开各行业公会负责人紧急会议
    动员有行贿行为者立即彻底坦白
    三百四十九人当场交代七百多件行贿事实尚未坦白者在延期三天内须抓紧时机坦白
    【新华社八日讯】北京市工商业联合会八日召集各行业的同业公会负责人开紧急会议，动员有行贿行为的立即彻底坦白交代，以便深入开展反贪污反行贿运动。
    在北京市工商业联合会主任委员傅华亭、新药业同业公会主任委员王敏生简短发言后，会议就分组进行坦白。
    傅华亭在他的动员报告中指出：北京市工商界反贪污反行贿运动虽然已经做到了家喻户晓，也交代了不少的问题，但是在所交代的问题中比较普遍地存在着讲小不讲大的现象，这种现象必须迅速加以改变，才能使运动深入。傅华亭说：“从今天起市节约检查委员会即进行检查，如查出有行贿行为而未坦白的即依法惩办。希望有问题的工商业者急起直追，没有坦白的，赶快坦白，坦白得不彻底的，立即补充材料。”他说：“天津铁路管理局北京分局对待九个案情较大的贪污走私分子两种不同的处理，是工商界最好的殷鉴。”最后，傅华亭号召市工商业联合会和各行业同业公会的负责人中有行贿行为者抓紧时机，在今天会议中带头把应该坦白的问题毫不含糊地全部坦白出来。”他说：“本来，坦白是很简单的事，就是忠诚老实还是不忠诚老实的问题，是讲还是不讲的问题，不须要有什么说服动员的。自己有行贿等犯罪行为，自己知道，应该赶快彻底坦白交代，以便取得人民政府的宽大处理，重罪减轻，轻罪减免，决没有什么值得再犹疑和观望的了。”
    新药业同业公会主任委员王敏生举该公会一个委员被职工检举的例子，说明抓紧时机、主动坦白、彻底交代是有行贿等不法行为的工商业者最好的改过自新的机会。不然，就要以身试法，那便后悔莫及了。
    今天会议，到会有市工商业联合会、各区办事处和一百三十五个行业公会正副主任委员、常务委员五百九十六人，分在十个组中以口头或书面等方式进行坦白，共有三百四十九人交代了七百四十七件，其中除补充材料者外，有二百九十七件是新坦白的。
    北京市节约检查委员会原定于今天起进行检查。市工商业联合会常务委员会恳切要求延期三天，给工商界中有行贿行为尚未坦白的人一个最后坦白的机会，然后进行检查，这一要求已经得到北京市人民政府市长彭真批准。
