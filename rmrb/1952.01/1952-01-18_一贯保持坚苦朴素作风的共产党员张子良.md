Communist Party Member Zhang Ziliang Consistently Maintains a Style of Hard Work and Plain Living
Fang Han

Three years ago, the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau received a new Deputy Director. He arrived with a small luggage roll and wearing an old military overcoat. To this day, he still wears that old military overcoat and sleeps on that small luggage roll, which contains only a gray blanket and a quilt that doesn't cover the cotton wadding. This Deputy Director, when he was in his hometown of northern Shaanxi, had never seen a forest. Although the time has not been long, he has already become someone whom the Soviet forestry expert Dainov calls a "Chinese forestry expert." This person is the Communist Party member Zhang Ziliang, whom I am introducing here.

In winter, when the farmers going up the mountains to fell trees had many opinions and low morale because they saw that the ice roads were not well-iced and the sleds were not strong, he went into their work sheds, ate sorghum rice with them, gave them speeches, reviewed his own failure to fulfill his responsibilities, not supervising the arrangements for equipment and supplies, assured them that improvements would be made immediately, and encouraged them to find ways to overcome temporary difficulties. The farmers were all moved and not only completed but exceeded their production tasks.

In winter, when the felling tasks were urgent, he wore that old military overcoat, carried a communications officer's white canvas document bag, and wore a pair of cotton rubber shoes. Every day he ran twenty or thirty li on the ice roads, personally inspected the ice roads, organized shock brigades, and launched competitions. During the day he was too tired from work to eat, and at night he thought about how to improve work and couldn't sleep. In just a few days his face became thin, but he finally ensured the completion of the felling tasks.

Since arriving at the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau, Comrade Zhang Ziliang has spent most of his time in the forest areas and often lived in the work sheds with the felling workers. There, he ate, slept, and lived with the workers. Many practical problems existing in production were discovered by him personally and then brought to the Bureau for resolution. Many new work experiences were created by him personally, together with the workers, based on advanced Soviet experiences. He personally cultivated the special-class labor model Li Youguo, who created the one-sided felling method, the special-class labor model Liu Jingui, who created the method of lowering tree stumps, the special-class labor model Wang Bingzhang, who created the method of cleaning up forest farms and utilizing treetop wood, and many other workers and groups who created advanced experiences, and he personally organized many experiences to be promoted throughout the region. In this way, he became a person familiar and loved by the forest area workers. He often received letters written to him by the felling workers.

For three whole years, he has not worn a pair of leather shoes or a woolen suit. Someone specially bought him a Parker pen from Shanghai, but he didn't want it. Someone else had used a fountain pen that they didn't want because they had lost the cap, but he picked it up, put a copper pen cap from a calligraphy brush on it, dipped it in water, and used it for a year. When he was still on the supply system, his father came to see him from his hometown. Others advised him to buy some things for his father, which could be reimbursed by the government, but he said, "What qualifications do I have to spend public money!" The spring before last, the wage system was changed, and everyone rated him at over four hundred points, but he said, "A hundred points is enough to eat and wear." Two months ago, the wage was changed to eight hundred points, but to this day he still lives according to the supply system standards, and the extra money is kept by the public and not taken. Others advised him not to be so hard on himself, but he said, "I'm not forcing myself at all. I grew up in hard times. What did we live in, what did we wear, what did we eat back then? I think it's already very good now." He then gently told others, "If we want to truly improve our lives, we should work even harder!"

He joined the revolution in 1936 and has been an old Party member for fifteen years. Before the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when he was the director of the supply department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in Yan'an, he was selected as a special-class labor model. But if someone who had worked with him hadn't said it, others might not have known about this until now. Even when the reporter went to interview him, he didn't provide any specific events, but only repeatedly said, "My work is not done well, I still have many shortcomings, I still have to study hard..." When asked about many things, he said he had forgotten; but he firmly remembered the instructions given to them by the Party when they set out from Yan'an to the Northeast. That instruction told him: after going from the countryside to the city, we must maintain the glorious tradition of the Party's hard work and plain living.

In Comrade Zhang Ziliang's mind, there is only how to work better for the Party, for the country, and for the people; personal interests do not occupy any position at all. He never felt that he had already gone through a difficult journey and should sit down and rest; on the contrary, he is the one who understands the true meaning of life the most, so he can optimistically and tenaciously move forward towards a bright future.

    一贯保持坚苦朴素作风的共产党员张子良
    方酣
    三年前，东北森林工业总局来了一位新任的副局长，他挟着一个小行李卷，穿着一件旧军用大衣。直到现在，他穿的仍旧是那件旧军用大衣，铺的仍旧是那个小行李卷，那里面只有一条灰毯子和一床包不住棉花的棉被。这位副局长，当他在他的家乡陕北的时候，从来也没有看见过森林；时间虽然不长，但他已经变成一位被苏联林业专家达依诺夫称为“中国的林业专家”的人。这个人，就是这里要介绍的共产党员张子良。
    冬天，当上山倒套子的农民们，因为看到冰道浇得不好，爬犁做得不结实，因此意见很多情绪很低的时候，他走进他们的工棚子，和他们一起吃高粱米饭，给他们讲话，检讨自己没有尽到责任，没有督促下面把设备和供应安排好，向他们保证一定马上改善，也鼓励他们想办法克服暂时的困难。农民们都受了感动，不但完成而且超过了生产任务。
    冬天，当采伐任务紧张的时候，他穿着那件旧军用大衣，背着一个通讯员用的白帆布文件包，脚上穿一双棉胶皮鞋，每天在冰道上跑二三十里路，亲自检查冰道，组织突击队，发动竞赛，他白天因工作劳累吃不下饭，晚上想如何改进工作睡不着觉，几天功夫脸上就瘦了，但他终于保证了采伐任务的完成。
    张子良同志自从到了东北森林工业总局以后，他的大部分时间是在林区，并经常和采伐工人一起住在工棚子里。在那里，他和工人们一起吃，一起睡，一起生活。许多生产当中存在的实际问题，是他亲自发现然后提到总局解决的；许多新的工作经验，是他根据苏联先进经验，亲自和工人们一起研究、试验、创造出来的。他亲手培养了创造一面倒采伐方法的特等劳动模范李国有，创造降低伐根的特等劳动模范刘金贵，创造清理林场利用梢头木的特等劳动模范王炳章，以及其他好多创造先进经验的工人和小组，并且亲自动手整理了许多经验推广到全区。就这样，他成了林区工人们熟悉和爱戴的人。他时常收到采伐工人们给他写的信。
    整整三年，他没有穿过一双皮鞋，一套呢子衣服。别人特意从上海买来一支派克笔送他，他不要；别人使旧了的一支自来水笔，因为丢了笔帽扔在桌上不要了，他却拣起来套上一支毛笔的铜笔帽，蘸水使了一年。当他还是供给制的时候，父亲从家乡来看他，别人劝他买些东西送给父亲，可以由公家报销，他说：“我有什么资格支公家钱用！”前年春天改了工薪制，大家给他评了四百多分，他说：“有一百多分够吃够穿就行了。”两个月以前工薪改为八百分，但是他直到现在仍然按供给制标准生活，多余的钱放在公家不领。别人劝他不要太刻苦，他说：“我这样一点也不勉强，从小在苦日子里熬出来了，从前那时候住什么？穿什么？吃什么？我觉得现在这样已经满好了。”他接着又婉转地告诉人家：“要想把生活真正提高一步，我们还应该更加努力工作！”
    他从一九三六年参加革命，已经是十五年的老党员了。抗战胜利以前，他在延安中共中央办公厅当供给处长的时候，曾经被选为特等劳动模范。可是如果不是曾经和他一起工作过的人替他说出来，别人也许到现在也不会知道这件事情。就是在记者去访问他的时候，他也没有提供一点具体事迹，却只是连连地说：“我的工作没有作好，我还有许多缺点，我还要好好学习……”问他许多事情，他说忘记了；但是他却牢牢记得当他们从延安出发到东北来的时候，党给他们的指示，那指示告诉他：从农村到城市以后，要保持党的坚苦朴素的光荣传统。
    张子良同志，在他的脑子里，只有怎样为党、为国家、为人民更好地工作，个人利益是不占据一点位置的。他决没感到自己已经走过一段艰苦的路程，应该坐下来歇歇了；相反地，他是最懂得生活的真义的人，所以他能够乐观地顽强地朝着光明的远景一直地前进。　（原载东北日报）
