    Study Comrade Zhang Linbai's Spirit of Refusing Bribes
    Editor: Comrade Zhang Linbai, Deputy Director of the Yangyuan Branch of the Monopoly Affairs Office of the Chanan Special District of Chahar Province, demonstrated the excellent qualities of a revolutionary cadre by refusing a bribe. The Yangyuan Branch discovered Liu Pinhan, the principal offender in privately distilling alcohol in Dongcheng Town, Yangyuan County, and sent him to the court for processing. However, Liu refused to confess his mistake and secretly instigated his cousin, Liu Fuhan, to bribe Comrade Zhang Linbai with 150,000 RMB, asking Zhang Linbai to "be lenient, turn a big problem into a small one, and a small one into nothing..." Zhang Linbai refused the bribe, but Liu Fuhan shamelessly left the money behind. Zhang Linbai immediately took the money to the court and explained the situation. In addition to giving the alcohol distilling offender Liu Pinhan the punishment he deserved, the court confiscated all of his bribe money and summoned Liu Fuhan to the court for education.
    I think that Comrade Zhang Linbai's spirit of refusing bribes is worthy of praise.

    学习张林柏同志拒不受贿的精神
    编辑同志：察哈尔省察南专区专卖事业处阳原分处副主任张林柏同志拒绝贿赂，表现了革命干部优良的品质。阳原分处在阳原县东城镇查获私自烧酒的主犯刘品汉，并把他送到法院处理。但刘犯拒绝坦白认错，反暗中唆使他的堂兄刘福汉，以十五万元人民币去贿赂张林柏同志，要张林柏“高抬贵手，大事压小，小事压无……。”张林柏拒绝受贿，但刘福汉仍厚颜无耻地把钱扔下。张林柏便马上把钱送到法院说明来由。法院除给烧酒犯刘品汉以应得的处分，全部没收他的行贿款项外，并把刘福汉传到法院，予以教育。
    张林柏同志这种拒不受贿的精神，我认为是值得表扬的。
