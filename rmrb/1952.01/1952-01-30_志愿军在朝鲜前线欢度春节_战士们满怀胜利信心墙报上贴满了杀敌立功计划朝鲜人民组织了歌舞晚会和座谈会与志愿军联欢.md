Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 29th. Our front-line reporter reports: The Chinese People's Volunteers, full of high confidence in victory, are celebrating their second Spring Festival during the war together with the Korean people. On the eve of the Spring Festival, heavy snow fell on the Korean battlefield. The volunteer soldiers, holding fast to the mountain positions on the front line, wrote "Celebrating the Spring Festival" and "New Year Victory" on the snow outside their shelters. Some soldiers made colorful arches out of pine branches, with Spring Festival couplets pasted on them. On both sides of the arch of the third platoon of a certain company were written "Work Together to Resist America and Aid Korea, Advance Together to Defend Our Homes and Country," and on the horizontal board was written "Make Persistent Efforts." Many shelters featured "Spring Festival Special Editions," and wall posters were filled with plans of commanders and combatants to kill the enemy and achieve merit, and patriotic frugality plans. On the morning of the Spring Festival, a festive scene was presented everywhere. Soldiers walked out of their positions in groups, stepping on the new snow to congratulate the brotherly units and the leaders of the units on the victory of the New Year. Wang Yucheng, leader of the "Unity Model Squad" of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, recalled: "Last year, we spent the Spring Festival with a handful of fried noodles and a mouthful of snow. This year, we can eat rice, white flour, and pork. But we must never forget the construction of our great motherland. We must not only be 'Heroes in Resisting America and Aiding Korea' but also 'Models of Patriotism and Thrift.'" The "Spring Festival Position Special Edition" published by this anti-aircraft artillery unit used pictures and texts to show their brilliant achievements in air defense: In the past seven months, they shot down 33 enemy planes and damaged 96. The gunners were not satisfied with these achievements. They expressed their determination to study hard and practice hard, continue to improve their skills, and use fewer shells to shoot down more enemy planes.

The volunteer units also held celebrations with the Korean residents in the garrison. Some units also sent representatives with towels, shoes, shirts, grain, and congratulatory letters saved by themselves to express their condolences to the families of martyrs and military personnel of the Korean People's Army. The Korean people also organized song and dance evenings or seminars to invite the volunteers to a joint celebration. Many volunteer soldiers also received a large number of condolence letters written by Korean workers and farmers. The Korean people unanimously stated in their letters: They are determined to fully support the Volunteers and the People's Army and strive for greater victories in the war against aggression.

    志愿军在朝鲜前线欢度春节
    战士们满怀胜利信心墙报上贴满了杀敌立功计划朝鲜人民组织了歌舞晚会和座谈会与志愿军联欢
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】本社前线记者报道：中国人民志愿军满怀着高度的胜利信心，和朝鲜人民一起欢度战争中的第二个春节。春节前夕，朝鲜战场上普降大雪。坚守在前线山岭阵地上的志愿军战士们，在掩蔽部外面的雪地上划上“庆祝春节”、“新春胜利”等字样。有些战士用松枝扎成彩门，上面贴着春联。某连三排的彩门的两边写着“抗美援朝同努力，保家卫国齐向前”，横额上写着“再接再厉”。许多掩蔽部里出现了“春节专刊”，墙报上面贴满着指挥员、战斗员们的杀敌立功计划和爱国节约计划。春节的早晨，到处呈现着一片节日的景象。战士们成群结队地走出阵地，踏着新雪向兄弟部队和部队首长祝贺新春胜利。某高射炮部队“团结模范班”班长王玉成回忆说：“去年春节我们过的是一把炒面一口雪的日子，今年春节我们可以吃上大米白面和猪肉了。但是我们决不要忘记我们伟大祖国的建设事业，我们不仅要做‘抗美援朝的英雄汉’，还要做‘爱国节约的模范’。”在这支高射炮部队出版的“春节阵地专刊”上，用图画和文字表明了他们对空射击的辉煌战绩：在过去的七个月中，他们曾击落敌机三十三架，击伤九十六架。炮手们对这些成绩并不满足，他们表示要苦学苦练，继续提高技术，用少数炮弹打落更多的敌机。
    志愿军各部队并和驻地朝鲜居民联欢。有些部队还派遣代表携带着自己节省下来的毛巾、鞋子、衬衣、粮食和贺信向人民军的烈士家属、军人家属进行慰问。朝鲜人民也组织了歌舞晚会或座谈会邀请志愿军举行联欢。许多志愿军战士还收到了朝鲜工人和农民们写的大批慰问信。朝鲜人民在信上一致表示：决以全力支援志愿军和人民军，争取在反侵略战争中得到更伟大的胜利。
