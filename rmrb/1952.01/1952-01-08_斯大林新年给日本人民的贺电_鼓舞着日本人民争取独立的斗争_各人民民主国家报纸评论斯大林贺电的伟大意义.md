Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Public opinion in the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries and the German Democratic Republic unanimously believes that Stalin's New Year's greetings to the Japanese people have inspired the Japanese people's struggle for independence and peace and are of great significance to the world's people's movement for peace.

According to a TASS report: "Scânteia," the organ of the Romanian Workers' Party, wrote in an editorial: Stalin's New Year's greetings are a remarkable document, a strong weapon for the people of the world in their struggle for peace. Every word of Stalin's kindles in the hearts of the Japanese people the hope for the liberation of their motherland and for a free and happy life. Every word of Stalin's reflects the most urgent aspirations of the Japanese people. The editorial added: The warm feelings and concern that the great Stalin has shown for the people who are in the cruel shackles of the imperialists have deeply moved the working people of the world. The Romanian people, who have experienced the suffering of capitalist exploitation and imperialist occupation, warmly praise Stalin's New Year's greetings and hold the same wishes that Stalin expressed to the Japanese people. "Capital Life" published a commentary saying: Stalin's New Year's greetings to the Japanese people are a great new contribution to the struggle of the people of all countries to defend peace. The enemies of peace—the American imperialists, who barbarously exploit the Japanese working people, intend to turn Japan into a bridgehead for aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's China. Stalin's New Year's greetings encourage the Japanese people to fight resolutely to smash the shackles of imperialism.

Bulgarian newspapers, on the 3rd, while publishing Stalin's New Year's greetings to the Japanese people, also published talks by many famous Bulgarian political and social leaders, Stakhanovite workers—Heroes of Socialist Labor—and Dimitrov Prize laureates. Academician Stoyanov, a member of the World Peace Council, wrote in "Rabotnichesko Delo": Stalin's lofty greetings to the Japanese people are precisely a manifestation of the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy and respect for the freedom and independence of all countries. Stalin's words will surely resonate in the hearts of all the people of Asia and other parts of the world who are groaning under the oppression of American imperialism.

"Szabad Nép," the organ of the Hungarian Workers' Party, wrote in an editorial entitled "New Year's Greetings Encouraging the Japanese People": Stalin's New Year's greetings are greetings of peace. The people of the whole world, especially the Japanese people, see from these New Year's greetings that the struggle against the American war plan has strong support. The Soviet people and their great leader understand the Japanese people's yearning for peace. They hope with deep sympathy that the Japanese people, who are suffering from the pain of occupation, will be successful in their struggle for freedom and peace.

"Trybuna Ludu," the organ of the Polish United Workers' Party, wrote in an editorial on the 3rd: Stalin's words are of great significance to the people of Japan and other countries because they are spoken by the leader of the peoples of the Soviet Union, a country that has openly declared its sympathy and support for all peoples fighting for freedom and independence since its establishment. These words are of great significance because they are spoken by the greatest peace fighter in the world, who expresses the thoughts of hundreds of millions of people in all countries.

Albanian newspapers published the full text of Stalin's New Year's greetings to the Japanese people on the front page on the 3rd under large headlines. Tirana Radio issued a commentary saying: This is another remarkable manifestation of the peace policy adopted by the Soviet government. This is a contribution to the great cause of the world's people in fighting to prevent another war.

"Neues Deutschland," the organ of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, said in an editorial: Stalin's New Year's greetings to the Japanese people are tantamount to saying to them: You have not been forgotten, you are not alone! These New Year's greetings also fill all peace-loving men and women with new confidence in the victory of the cause of peace, urging them to redouble their efforts to fight for peace.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th. According to TASS, Pyongyang, 6th. On January 4th, all Korean newspapers unanimously published the full text of Stalin's New Year's greetings to the Japanese people, and the radio station broadcast the full text several times. The Korean people attach great importance to this document.

An Ham-kwang, secretary of the Korean National Committee for the Promotion of Peace, wrote an article pointing out the great historical significance of Stalin's New Year's greetings. In his article, he talked about the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy towards Japan, and about the Soviet Union's desire for Japan to gain freedom, independence and democratic development.

The Korean Central News Agency reported: All the Korean people who are fighting against the American aggressors are full of hope for the struggle of the good people in Japan against the measures of the reactionary Yoshida government, and against its following the orders of its American masters to send Japanese youth to the Korean front to die in vain. The Korean people wish the Japanese people victory in their sacred struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland.

    鼓舞着日本人民争取独立的斗争
    各人民民主国家报纸评论斯大林贺电的伟大意义
    【新华社七日讯】东欧人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国的舆论，一致认为斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电鼓舞了日本人民争取独立与和平的斗争，对全世界人民争取和平的运动具有重大的意义。
    据塔斯社消息：罗马尼亚工人党机关报“火花报”在社论中写道：斯大林的贺电是一篇卓越的文件，这个文件是全世界人民为和平而斗争的坚强武器。斯大林的每一句话都在日本人民的心中燃起对于他们祖国的解放和获得自由和幸福的生活的希望之火。斯大林的每一句话都反映出日本人民的最迫切的愿望。社论又说：伟大的斯大林对处在帝国主义者残酷桎梏下的人民表示的热烈感情和关切，使全世界劳动人民内心受到深切的感动。曾经经历过资本家剥削和帝国主义者占领的苦难的罗马尼亚人民，热烈地赞扬斯大林的贺电，并抱着和斯大林向日本人民所表示的相同的愿望。“首都生活报”发表评论说：斯大林给日本人民的贺电，对各国人民为保卫和平而进行的斗争是一个巨大的新贡献。和平的敌人——野蛮地剥削着日本劳动人民的美帝国主义者，打算把日本变成侵略苏联和人民中国的桥头堡。斯大林的贺电鼓舞日本人民为粉碎帝国主义的桎梏而坚决斗争。
    保加利亚各报三日在刊载斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电的同时，还发表了保加利亚许多著名的政治领袖和社会领袖、斯塔哈诺夫式工作者——社会主义劳动英雄和季米特洛夫奖金得奖人的谈话。世界和平理事会理事、科学院院士斯图扬诺夫在“工人事业报”上写道：斯大林对日本人民的崇高祝词，正是苏联爱好和平的政策和对各国人民自由和独立的尊重的表示。斯大林的话必将在呻吟于美帝国主义压迫之下的所有亚洲和其他各地人民的心中得到共鸣。
    匈牙利工人党机关报“自由人民报”在题为“给日本人民以勉励的贺电”的社论中写道：斯大林的贺电是和平的贺电。全世界的人民，首先是日本人民，从这个贺电中看到：反对美国战争计划的斗争有了强有力的支持，苏联人民及其伟大的领袖都体会到日本人民对和平的渴望，他们怀着深切的同情希望遭受占领之苦的日本人民在争取自由与和平的斗争中获得成功。
    波兰统一工人党机关报“人民论坛报”在三日的社论中写道：斯大林的话所以对于日本和其他各国的人民都有重大的意义，就因为这是由苏联各族人民的领袖说出来的，而苏联乃是一个从一成立起就公开宣布同情并支持一切为自由和独立而奋斗的人民的国家。这些话之所以有重大的意义，就因为这是由世界上伟大的和平斗士说出来的，他表达了各国千百万人民的思想。
    阿尔巴尼亚各报三日在首页以大字标题登载斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电的全文。地拉那广播发表评论说：这是苏联政府所采取的和平政策的又一显著的表现。这是对世界人民为防止另一次战争而斗争的伟大事业的贡献。
    德国统一社会党机关报“新德意志报”在社论中说：斯大林向日本人民发出贺电，不啻向他们说：你们不曾被人忘记，你们不是孤独的！这一贺电也使一切爱好和平的男女对和平事业的胜利充满了新的信念，敦促他们加倍努力，争取和平。
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社平壤六日讯：一月四日朝鲜各报一致刊载斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电的全文，电台也把全文广播了好几次。朝鲜人民对于这个文件表示非常重视。
    朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会书记长安含光，写了一篇文章指出斯大林的这个新年贺电具有极大的历史意义。他在文章中谈到苏联对日本推行始终一贯的和平政策，谈到苏联热望日本获得自由、独立和民主发展的机会。
    朝鲜中央通讯社报道：正在对美国侵略者作战的全体朝鲜人民，对于日本国内善良人民为反对反动的吉田政府的措施、为反对它奉行美国主子的命令把日本青年调到朝鲜前线白白送死而进行的斗争，满怀希望。朝鲜人民祝日本人民在为祖国的自由和独立而进行的神圣斗争中，得到胜利。
