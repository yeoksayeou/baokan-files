Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: As a result of implementing the policy of responsible cadres taking the lead and fully mobilizing the masses, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Beijing has formed a situation of internal and external attack and layered encirclement, and is now concentrating its efforts on rounding up major embezzlers.

In mid-December, when the mobilization to launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began, Peng Zhen, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, clearly pointed out: To lead the movement to victory, we must resolutely implement the policy of responsible cadres taking the lead and fully mobilizing the masses. To this end, Peng Zhen personally delivered several mobilization reports at cadre meetings inside and outside the Party and at the Municipal People's Congress. Subsequently, various organs, organizations, industrial and mining enterprises, and districts, sections, villages, as well as the business community, held various large and small meetings, repeatedly mobilizing at each level, generally arousing the attention of people from all walks of life in the city. A city-wide anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched vigorously on this basis.

In the initial stage of the movement, although the specific situation of each organ and enterprise was not completely the same, generally, after the responsible cadres took the lead in making self-criticisms, the focus was on starting with the anti-corruption struggle; the business community concentrated its efforts on launching the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property; and people from other walks of life gradually launched the exposure of illegal activities such as bribery and acceptance of bribes by unscrupulous merchants and cadres. During this stage, the materials confessed and exposed generally involved relatively small cases. At this time, among the staff of the organs, after clarifying right and wrong and distinguishing between public and private interests, the attention of the masses was gradually directed to larger corruption cases; in the business community, the focus was on continuing to mobilize to eliminate concerns and strive for more and larger cases of confession and admission, so that the movement would continue to deepen.

Then, on the 4th of this month, various organs and enterprises, starting with the Beijing branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, universally held anti-corruption struggle rallies, using the specific facts of handling a group of corrupt elements to carry out policy education, pointing out that thorough confession is the only way out for corrupt elements. To break the僥幸 mentality of illegal industrialists and merchants and to encourage them to thoroughly confess their guilt and start anew, the Municipal Economy Practice Examination Committee has been conducting key inspections since the 13th of this month, and has arrested and brought to justice unscrupulous merchants such as Liu Yuanjing, who had stolen more than 8 billion yuan of state property and refused to confess, while mobilizing shop assistants throughout the city to expose them. This has greatly advanced the movement. The number of confessed materials has increased significantly compared to before, and there are also larger cases confessed in the materials.

Immediately afterwards, the Municipal Economy Practice Examination Committee dispatched more than a dozen inspection teams to conduct key inspections of illegal industrialists and merchants, and later dispatched hundreds of inspection teams to conduct large-scale inspections. The Municipal Economy Practice Examination Committee also took an important step, mobilizing thousands of people to form more than 260 working groups, going directly into the jurisdiction of each public security police station, and adopting methods such as symposiums and visits to mobilize people from all walks of life to universally expose crimes. In this way, even the most hidden materials were revealed.

Because the Beijing Municipal Economy Practice Examination Committee implemented the policy of responsible cadres taking the lead and fully mobilizing the masses, and carried out the above-mentioned work, it has created a favorable situation of internal and external attack and layered encirclement, making many major corrupt elements isolated. Now, the Municipal Economy Practice Examination Committee is leading the people of the city in encircling and suppressing major corrupt elements.

    北京市全力围剿大贪污犯
    内外夹攻层层包围的有利形势已经形成只有彻底坦白才是贪污分子唯一的出路
    【新华社二十三日讯】由于贯彻了负责干部亲自动手和全面发动群众的方针，北京市的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已经形成内外夹攻和层层包围的形势，现在正集中全力围剿大贪污犯。
    上月中旬，在开始动员开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的时候，中国共产党北京市委员会书记、北京市人民政府市长彭真即明确指出：要把运动引向胜利，必须坚决贯彻负责干部亲自动手和全面发动群众的方针。为此，彭真亲自在党内外的干部大会和市人民代表会议上接连作了几次动员报告。随着，各机关、团体、工矿、企业和各区、段、村以及工商界都召开了各种大大小小的会议，层层地、反复地进行动员，普遍引起全市各阶层人民的重视。一个全市规模的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，便在这样的基础上轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。
    运动初期，各机关企业的具体情况虽然不完全相同，但是一般都是在负责干部亲自动手带头检讨之后，着重地从反贪污斗争开始；工商界就集中全力开展反行贿、反偷税、反盗骗国家资财的斗争，其他阶层人民检举奸商和干部行贿、受贿等不法行为也逐步展开。在这个阶段中，所有坦白和检举的材料，案情一般都比较小。这时候，在机关工作人员方面主要是经过明辨是非、划清公私界限之后，把群众的注意力逐渐引向较大的贪污案件上去；在工商界方面主要是继续动员消除顾虑，争取坦白交代较多和较大的案件，使运动继续走向深入。
    接着，本月四日，各机关企业从天津铁路局北京分局开始，普遍举行反贪污斗争大会，通过分别处理一批贪污分子的具体事实来进行政策教育，指出彻底坦白才是贪污分子唯一的出路。对不法工商业者，市节约检查委员会为了打破他们的侥幸心理，促使他们彻底坦白悔过自新，自本月十三日开始进行重点检查，并将盗骗国家资财八十亿以上拒不坦白的奸商刘元敬等犯逮捕法办，同时发动全市店员进行检举。这样，便把运动大大地推进了一步。坦白的材料比较以前显著地增加了，在材料中也有交代较大的案件的。
    紧接着，市节约检查委员会对不法工商业者派了十几个检查组进行重点检查，后又派几百个检查组进行大规模检查。市节约检查委员会并采取了一个重要的步骤，动员上千人组成二百六十多个工作组，直接深入到各公安派出所管界内，采取座谈、访问等方式，发动各阶层群众普遍进行检举。这样，连最隐秘的材料都被揭露出来了。
    北京市节约检查委员会因为贯彻了负责干部亲自动手和全面发动群众的方针，进行以上种种的工作，已造成一个内外夹攻、层层包围的有利形势，使得许多大贪污分子孤立起来了。现在，市节约检查委员会正领导全市人民对大贪污分子进行围剿。
