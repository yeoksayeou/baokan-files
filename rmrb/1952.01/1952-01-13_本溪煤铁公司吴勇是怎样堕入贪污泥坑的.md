In November 1950, not long after the campaign to Resist America and Aid Korea began, a group of unscrupulous merchants gathered in Benxi City believed that a good opportunity to make exorbitant profits had arrived. They purchased large quantities of iron from the Benxi Coal and Iron Company through under-the-table deals. Then, they despicably pressured Wu Yong, the deputy chief of the business section of the Benxi Coal and Iron Company's management department, who had accepted their bribes, to secure railway cars. Wu Yong said, "This is difficult." The merchants clamored, "If you don't give us railway cars, dare to argue with us?" Wu Yong, fearing the exposure of his bribery, had to say in a low voice, "Don't make noise, I'll find a way to solve it!" He used the company's name to secure some railway cars for them. This matter was immediately known to another merchant, who threatened Wu Yong, "You sold iron to them, won't you sell to me?" Wu Yong also sold him some iron. This merchant further threatened Wu Yong, "You gave them railway cars, you have to give them to me, or I'll report you!" Wu Yong had no choice but to allocate two more railway cars to him. Wu Yong, who accepted bribes from merchants, was thus captured by the merchants and became their shameful servant.

Wu Yong had fought tenaciously in the arduous revolutionary struggle. In 1939, he joined the revolution in the Jidong anti-Japanese base area, and joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1941. In February 1944, during a battle in Jidong, he was captured by the Japanese invaders and spent 440 days in prison. He was subjected to countless beatings and electric shocks by the Japanese invaders, but he never yielded. He even hit a Japanese translator with a teapot. Seeing that he couldn't be forced, the enemy used soft tactics, giving him good food every day, and a Japanese squad leader personally accompanied him. But he still did not reveal any secrets of the Party. Many of the grains, medicines, clothing, and firearms that he had hidden before his capture were also not lost. After he was released in April 1945, the Chinese Communist Party organization reviewed this period of his history. At that time, residents of five villages who had hidden materials for him jointly wrote letters proving that he could withstand severe tests in front of the Japanese invaders and did not harm the interests of the people.

Wu Yong should have carried forward this glorious deed in the subsequent revolutionary struggle and made more contributions to the Party and the people. But he didn't do that! In September 1949, when he went to the Material Section of the Shenyang Office of Benxi Coal and Iron Company as deputy section chief, he thought, "The revolution has been won, and years of hard life can be ended. I should enjoy it!" Therefore, when the merchants insidiously launched an attack on him, he succumbed to the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets!

The means used by the merchants against Wu Yong were extremely despicable. When he was working in Shenyang, he met a merchant he had known when he was a shop assistant in Harbin in his youth. This merchant initially invited Wu Yong to watch movies and operas, and then invited him to restaurants. Seeing that Wu Yong accepted small bribes, this merchant then made a bigger move. He personally sent a cashmere overcoat and a watch to Wu Yong's home in Benxi. Wu Yong refused to accept the merchant's watch, but the merchant secretly put two watches in the pocket of Wu Yong's unworn clothes. Wu Yong didn't discover them until he put on the clothes and went to work the next day. Seeing that Wu Yong had a "Parker 51" fountain pen but no "Parker 51" ink, the merchant bought a bottle and sent it to him. Seeing that Wu Yong's family did not have a thermos, the merchant rushed to buy one and send it over. When Wu Yong's child fell ill, the merchants surrounding him seized the opportunity to show their concern and said, "Let me accompany you to a hospital opened by my friend!" When Wu Yong returned home from the hospital, he found 10 million Northeast currency in his child's pocket. A group of merchants, in order to build a relationship with Wu Yong, brought Wu Yong's elder brother from Shenyang to Benxi City to live with them. Wu Yong's elder brother had a cough, and the merchants bought him pineapple canned goods and delicacies of the sea and land every day.

Wu Yong's bribery process went from small to large, sinking deeper and deeper. In 1949, when he went to work in Harbin City, he accepted a total of 5 million Northeast currency in bribes from a merchant in two instances. Unable to resist this temptation, Wu Yong became corrupt, and in 1950, he went from accepting 10 million Northeast currency at a time to 50 million. Wu Yong confessed, "Every time I accepted bribes from merchants, I felt that the Party and the people would not tolerate my criminal behavior, and it would be discovered sooner or later. The ideological struggle was very fierce. But in the end, I could not resist the material temptation and accepted the filthy bribes. At the same time, after each acceptance of bribes, I made up my mind: this is the last time! But when I encountered merchants bribing again, I forgot the last resolution." Intoxicated with shameless enjoyment, Wu Yong accepted a total of more than 20 million yuan in RMB bribes from the second half of 1949 to September last year.

After Wu Yong accepted bribes from merchants, he betrayed the interests of the state and the people to satisfy them. In the movement against corruption and degeneration vigorously launched in the Northeast, Wu Yong confessed under mass pressure, "The purpose of the merchants bribing me was to make me serve them; my care for them was to use various methods to make them more profitable." Just two examples that can be calculated can illustrate how serious the losses Wu Yong caused to the state and the people were. In 1950, Wu Yong sold iron to merchants at prices not in accordance with state regulations, causing the state a price difference loss of more than 280 million yuan in RMB. A group of merchants in Shenyang City bribed Wu Yong a total of 6 million yuan, and under Wu Yong's "care," they stole more than 1 billion yuan of wealth from the state and the people.

    本溪煤铁公司吴勇是怎样堕入贪污泥坑的
    新华社记者  周群
    在一九五零年十一月抗美援朝运动开始不久的时候，麕集在本溪市的一批奸商认为发暴利财的好时机来到了，他们便向本溪煤铁公司套买了大量的铁。接着他们又卑鄙地逼着接受过他们贿赂的本溪煤铁公司经理处业务科副科长吴勇要车皮。吴勇说：“这可难办了。”奸商们就吵嚷起来：“你不给车皮，敢和我们去讲理吗？”吴勇畏惧受贿罪迹暴露，只好低声下气地说：“别吵嚷，设法解决就是了！”他以公司名义给他们要了一些车皮。这事马上被另一个奸商知道了，就去威胁吴勇：“你卖给他们铁，不卖给我吗？”吴勇便也卖给他一些铁。这个奸商又进一步威胁吴勇：“你给他们车皮，不给我不行，我要告发！”吴勇只得又拨给他两个车皮。接受了奸商贿赂的吴勇，就是这样被奸商抓住，可耻地作了他们的奴仆。
    吴勇是曾经在艰苦的革命斗争中顽强地战斗过来的。一九三九年，他在冀东抗日根据地参加革命，一九四一年加入中国共产党。一九四四年二月在冀东一次战斗中，他被日寇俘掳，过了四百四十天的铁窗生活。他曾遭受日寇无数次鞭打、过电等酷刑，但毫未屈服，并用茶壶打过日寇的翻译。敌人看他不吃硬的，便来软的，天天给他好饭吃，并由日寇的一个小队长亲自作陪。但他仍然没有暴露党的任何秘密。他在被俘前所收藏的许多粮食、药品、服装、枪械等也都未受损失。他在一九四五年四月被释放后，中国共产党的组织曾审查他这一段历史。当时为他隐藏物资的五个村的居民曾联名写信证明他在日寇面前经得起严重的考验，而且没有损害人民的利益。
    吴勇应该在以后的革命斗争中，把这一段光辉事迹发扬光大，为党为人民建立更多的功勋。但他没有这样做！一九四九年九月，当他到本溪煤铁公司沈阳办事处材料科任副科长时，他便以为“革命胜利了，多少年的艰苦生活可以结束，应该享受享受了！”因此，奸商们阴险地向他一进攻，他便在资产阶级的糖衣炮弹面前屈服了！
    奸商们对吴勇施行的手段是卑鄙到了极点的。他在沈阳工作时，遇见了一个他青年时代在哈尔滨作店员时认识的商人。这个商人起初请吴勇看电影看戏，看完后又请他进馆子。看见吴勇接受了小贿赂，这个奸商接着便来大的了。他把?绒大衣和手表亲自送到本溪吴勇家里。吴勇不收奸商的表，奸商就偷偷把两只表放在吴勇没有穿的衣服的口袋里。吴勇直到第二天穿衣上班时才发现。这个奸商看见吴勇有“五一”派克自来水钢笔，却没有“五一”派克牌墨水，就给买了一瓶送去。那个奸商看见吴勇家里没有热水瓶，便抢着给买了一个送去。吴勇的小孩生了病，包围他的奸商便乘机献殷勤说：“我陪你到我朋友开设的一个医院去吧！”吴勇从医院回家时，发现他的小孩衣袋里有一千万元东北币。有一批奸商为了要和吴勇拉关系，便把吴勇的哥哥从沈阳弄到本溪市来和他们一起居住。吴勇的哥哥有咳嗽病，奸商们就每天给买凤梨罐头和山珍海味吃。
    吴勇的受贿过程是由小到大，越陷越深的。一九四九年他去哈尔滨市工作时，两次共接受了一个奸商五百万元东北币的贿赂。抵抗不了这种引诱，吴勇便腐化下去了，在一九五零年就从一次接受东北币一千万元发展到五千万元。吴勇自己坦白说：“每次接受奸商贿赂时，自己觉得党和人民对我这种犯罪行为是不会容忍的，而且迟早会被发觉的，思想斗争得很激烈。但最后总是经不起物质引诱，接受了污秽的贿赂。同时，每接受一次贿赂之后，便下决心：这是最后的一次了！但再遇到奸商行贿时，就忘记了上次的决心。”醉心于无耻享受的吴勇，自一九四九年下半年到去年九月，就是这样地接受了共合人民币二千多万元的贿赂。
    吴勇接受奸商的贿赂后，便出卖国家和人民的利益来满足他们。在东北大张旗鼓反对贪污蜕化的运动中，吴勇在群众压力下自供说：“奸商向我行贿的目的，就是要我为他们服务；我对他们的照顾就是用种种方法使他们多得利润。”仅举两个能够计算出来的例子就可以说明吴勇给国家和人民所造成的损失是多么严重了。一九五零年，吴勇不按国家规定价格把铁卖给奸商，使国家遭受的差价损失就达人民币二亿八千多万元。沈阳市的一批奸商共向吴勇行贿六百万元，而他们在吴勇的“照顾”下，却从国家和人民的手里盗取了十亿多元的财富。
