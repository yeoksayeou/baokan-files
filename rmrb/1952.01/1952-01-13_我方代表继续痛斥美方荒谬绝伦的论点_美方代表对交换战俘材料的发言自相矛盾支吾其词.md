Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th — At the subcommittee meeting on the third item of the Korean armistice negotiations on January 12th, our representative continued to refute the absurd argument of the other side that the construction of airfield facilities in our territory during the armistice would threaten their security. Our representative pointed out that our side has already suggested not bringing any reinforcing combat aircraft from outside of Korea. If the other side is also willing to make this guarantee as we are, then it is fundamentally impossible for either side to greatly increase its air power during the armistice, and the other side has no reason to feel threatened. As for whether or not either side carries out this or that kind of facility construction during the armistice, it is entirely a matter of internal affairs, and the military armistice negotiations have no right to discuss it.

At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth item of the agenda, the other side not only continued to use "one-for-one exchange" and "voluntary repatriation" as excuses, plotting to detain our captured personnel and hand them over to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, but also openly stated, regarding the difference of 1,456 people in the list of prisoners of war handed over by the other side and the whereabouts of 44,205 missing personnel from our side: "There is no need to hand over these materials before an agreement is reached." Our representative denounced the other side's repeatedly self-contradictory and unreasonable attitude. Our representative said: "For a long period in the past, when your side used the exchange of materials as an excuse to refuse to discuss the principle of the prompt release and repatriation of all prisoners of war after the armistice, your side repeatedly claimed that the exchange of prisoner-of-war materials was a prerequisite for entering into a discussion of principles, and that problems could not be considered without materials. But now you say that there is no need to hand over materials before an agreement is reached. When your side put forward these so-called prerequisites, your side repeatedly cited the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war, attempting to hinder the discussion of substantive issues, but when truly discussing the release and repatriation of all prisoners of war, your side openly opposed the provisions of the Geneva Convention and put forward the so-called principle of voluntary repatriation, actually demanding that prisoners of war give up their right to repatriation after the armistice. In your news publications, it is openly reported that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan has instructors carrying out so-called indoctrination education among our captured personnel. Your side has even barbarically tattooed anti-communist and anti-Soviet characters on the bodies of our captured personnel. This is the truth of your so-called 'voluntary repatriation,' that is, 'voluntary detention.'" The other side stammered and avoided answering our questions.

### 我方代表继续痛斥美方荒谬绝伦的论点  美方代表对交换战俘材料的发言自相矛盾支吾其词

    我方代表继续痛斥美方荒谬绝伦的论点
    美方代表对交换战俘材料的发言自相矛盾支吾其词
    【新华社开城十二日电】在一月十二日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续驳斥对方所谓停战期间我方境内机场设备的修建将威胁对方安全的荒谬绝伦的论点。我方代表指出我方已经建议不从朝鲜境外进入任何增援的作战飞机，如果对方也和我方一样愿意作此保证，则双方在停战期间根本不可能大量增加空军力量，对方没有任何可能感到威胁。至于双方在停战期间进行或不进行这一种或那一种设备则完全是内政问题，军事停战谈判中根本无权提出讨论。
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方不但继续以“一对一交换”和“自愿遣返”为藉口，阴谋扣留我方被俘人员送交蒋李匪帮，而对于对方交来战俘名单中一千四百五十六人的差额和四万四千二百零五人下落不明的我方人员，竟公然声称：“在协议达成前，并没有交出这些材料的必要。”我方代表痛斥对方这种一再自相矛盾的蛮横无理的态度，我方代表说：“在过去很长的时期中，当你方藉口交换材料，拒绝讨论停战后迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则时，你方一再声称战俘材料的交换，是进入原则讨论的先决条件，没有材料不能考虑问题。但现在你却说在协议达成前不需要交出材料。当你方提出这些所谓先决条件时，你方一再引用日内瓦战俘公约，企图阻碍实质问题的讨论，但当真正讨论释放与遣送全体战俘时，你方却又公然反对日内瓦战俘公约的规定，提出所谓自愿遣返的原则，实际上要求战俘放弃停战后遣返的权利。你方新闻报刊中，公开报道台湾蒋匪帮在我方被俘人员中派有教官进行所谓感化教育。你方更在我方被俘人员的身上野蛮地刺上了反共反苏的字样。这就是你方所谓‘自愿遣返’，亦即‘自愿被扣’的真相。”对方支吾其词，避免答复我方的质问。
