On the Front Lines of the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy

    Tianjin Women Actively Participate in the Anti-Corruption Struggle

    Hundreds of thousands of women in Tianjin, along with the city's people, are focusing their firepower on a comprehensive encirclement and suppression of corrupt elements and illegal merchants.

    In the early stages of this movement, the Tianjin women's community took a detour. Many women initially failed to clearly understand the significance of the movement and their responsibilities in it, focusing only on saving money in their daily lives. After discovering this deviation, the Tianjin Democratic Women's Federation promptly convened meetings, repeatedly explaining the policies and pointing out that the main task of the women in this movement was to break through sentimentalities and resolutely fight against illegal acts such as corruption, waste, and theft of state property, vigorously carrying out mobilization, propaganda, and denunciation movements. Subsequently, activists in women's organizations in various streets were mobilized to conduct large-scale propaganda. After sufficient propaganda and deliberation, denunciation meetings were held "while the iron was hot." For example, twenty-four women in the Fourth District reported a total of ninety-six cases of corruption, bribery, and tax evasion at one denunciation meeting. Many women also mercilessly denounced fathers, brothers, or husbands who refused to confess. For example, Chen Shuping, a housewife in the Fifth District, mobilized seven people to confess, the first of whom was her husband. Gu Xianyu, a housewife in the Tenth District, forced her husband, who had engaged in bribery, to confess at the confession meeting of the industrial and commercial circles. She herself also went to the meeting to see if her husband's confession was thorough.

    Shop Assistants in Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Other Cities Denounce Illegal Capitalists

    Shop assistants in Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jinan, Yangzhou, and other cities have begun to join the battle of denouncing corrupt and bribing elements. Shop assistants in Wuxi City, from January 7th, on the one hand, mobilized capitalists with illegal activities to confess, and on the other hand, denounced merchants who refused to confess. On the 16th, the city's shop employees and workers held their first representative meeting, launching a wave of denunciations, and on the spot denounced 416 cases of bribery and tax evasion. Among them, the native tobacco industry and the mineral oil industry alone had eighteen kinds of tax evasion tricks. And the native tobacco industry alone had evaded 2.8 billion yuan in taxes in two years. The shop employees' unions in Hangzhou, Jinan, Yangzhou, and other cities also held mobilization meetings, and the shop assistants boldly exposed and denounced.

    Taiyuan City Should Quickly Mobilize Shop Assistants to Participate in the Struggle

    The anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in Taiyuan City is not progressing quickly, mainly because the Taiyuan City Shop Employees' Union does not pay attention to mobilizing and leading the city's shop employees and handicraft workers to participate in this movement. As of the 19th, Taiyuan City had not held a mobilization meeting for shop employees and handicraft workers. Therefore, the city's shop employees still have ideological concerns such as fear of retaliation, fear of losing their jobs, and inability to break through sentimentalities. Some shop employees have even been won over by illegal merchants. The Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions and the City Shop Employees' Union must immediately pay attention to correcting this serious situation and quickly convene an emergency meeting of all shop employees or a representative meeting of shop employees to explain the policies, dispel the concerns of shop employees, and enable the city's shop employees and handicraft workers to quickly join the battle against corruption and bribery.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    天津市妇女积极参加反贪污斗争
    天津市数十万妇女和全市人民一道，集中火力向贪污分子、不法商人进行全面围剿。
    天津市妇女界在开展了这一运动的初期，曾走了一段弯路。许多妇女开始时都未能明确认识这一运动的意义和自己在运动中的职责，只在生活上力求节约。天津市民主妇女联合会发现这一偏向后，曾及时地召集会议，反复地讲明政策，指出妇女们在这一运动中的主要任务是破除情面，对贪污、浪费、偷窃国家财产等不法行为作坚决斗争，大力开展动员、宣传和检举运动。随后，就发动各街道妇女组织中的积极分子大规模地进行宣传。在经过充分的宣传酝酿以后，就“趁热打铁”举行检举大会。如第四区有二十四个妇女在一次检举会上就检举出贪污、行贿、漏税等不法行为共九十六件。许多妇女而且毫不容情地检举了不肯坦白的父兄或丈夫。如第五区的家庭妇女陈淑萍曾动员了七个人坦白，其中第一个就是她的丈夫。第十区的家庭妇女顾先瑜，逼着有贿赂行为的丈夫到工商界的坦白大会上去交代。她自己也到会场去，看丈夫坦白得是否彻底。
    无锡杭州等市店员检举不法资方
    无锡、杭州、济南、扬州等市店员，已开始投入检举贪污行贿分子的战斗中。无锡市的店员，从一月七日起，一方面动员有不法行为的资方坦白，一方面对拒不坦白的商人进行了检举。十六日，该市店员工人举行了第一次代表会议，掀起检举的热潮，当场检举了四百一十六件行贿偷税案件。其中仅土烟业与矿油两业，就有十八种逃税的花样。而土烟一业，在两年中，就偷漏税款二十八亿元。杭州、济南、扬州等市的店员工会也都分别召开了动员会议，店员们也都大胆地进行了揭发和检举。
    太原市应赶快发动店员参加斗争
    太原市的反贪污反行贿运动进展不快，主要原因是太原市店员工会不注意发动和领导全市店员和手工业工人参加这一运动。到十九日为止，太原市还没有召开过店员和手工业工人的动员大会。因此，全市店员至今仍然有怕报复、怕丢饭碗、打不破情面等等思想顾虑，甚至有些店员还被不法商人拉拢了过去。太原市总工会和市店员工会必须立即注意纠正这种严重情况，赶快召集全市店员紧急会议或店员代表会议，讲明政策，解除店员顾虑，使全市店员和手工业工人赶快投入反贪污反行贿的战斗中去。
