    Datong Coal Mine Doesn't Value Safety Work Enough
    Continuous Worker Deaths and Injuries Occur
    
    Comrade Editor: Recently, worker deaths and injuries have occurred continuously at the Datong Coal Mine in Chahar. Liu Baoshun, a trammer in a certain pit of the No. 1 Mine, had requested to go down the pit several times, but was not permitted by the administrative side. On November 30th last year, he took advantage of the opportunity when technician Su Jinbao went to the city and said to Team Leader Jin of the engineering team, "The technician has already allowed me to go down the pit." Team Leader Jin then allowed him to go down the pit. Afterwards, the technician criticized his group leader. On the evening of December 2nd, Liu sneaked into the pit from another shaft opening. The next morning, the cage in this pit malfunctioned. In order to repair the cage, the workers underground asked for ropes from above to pull them up. At that time, Liu Baoshun insisted on coming up. When people were pulling him up midway, the rope broke, and Liu was killed in the fall. On December 4th, blasting workers Yang Haisheng and Zhao San of the No. 3 Mine caused a blasting accident due to carelessness in their work, and both were seriously injured by the blast. On the same day, roof coal fell in a certain stope of the No. 3 Mine, killing two workers and injuring one. The reason for these accidents is mainly that the leading cadres of the Datong Coal Mine Bureau do not pay enough attention to safety work. I believe that in the future, the Datong Coal Mine Bureau should regularly conduct safety education for workers.

### 大同煤矿对保安工作重视不够  连续发生工人死伤事故

    大同煤矿对保安工作重视不够
    连续发生工人死伤事故
    编辑同志：察哈尔大同煤矿最近连续发生工人死伤事故。第一矿某井推车工刘宝顺曾几次要求下井，没有得到行政方面的允许。去年十一月三十日，他乘技术员苏金保进城的机会，就对工程队靳队长说：“技术员已允许我下井了。”靳队长便允许他下井。事后，技术员批评了他所属的小组长。十二月二日晚上，刘又偷着从别的井口下了井。第二天早晨，这个井的圆罐笼发生故障。为了修理圆罐笼，井下的工人向上边要绳子，要求把他们拉上来。当时，刘宝顺坚决要上来。当人们拉他至中途时，绳断了，刘被摔死。十二月四日，第三矿放炮工人杨海生、赵三因工作不谨慎，发生炮爆炸事故，两人被炸重伤。同日，第三矿某井回采场顶煤下落，又砸死工人二名，砸伤一名。这些事故产生的原因，主要是大同煤矿矿务局领导干部对保安工作不够重视，我认为今后大同煤矿矿务局应经常向工人进行安全教育。
