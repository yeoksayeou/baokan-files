Li Xiaobo, Deputy Director of the Armed Forces Department of the Chahar Provincial Public Security Department, engaged in very serious embezzlement, waste, and bureaucratic practices. In the current anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, he suppressed democracy and hindered the progress of the movement. The leadership of the Provincial Public Security Department has dismissed him from his post, and the struggle against corruption and waste in the Armed Forces Department has also begun.

At the beginning of this movement, the leadership of the Public Security Department, in order to correct the dangerous tendencies of corruption and degeneration of Li Xiaobo and others, decided to focus the movement on the Armed Forces Department. This was a good opportunity for Li Xiaobo to eliminate the influence of decadent bourgeois ideology. However, he was very dissatisfied and said, "What can I criticize? I've already heard enough reports in Beijing!" When he made a mobilization report in his own department, he only talked about his bureaucratic work style and mentioned waste in passing, but he didn't mention his embezzlement at all. He was very afraid that everyone would expose him, and when studying the documents, he threatened the cadres, saying, "Whoever makes unfounded accusations is my enemy, and I will eliminate him!"

Li Xiaobo dared to stand on the opposite side to resist the movement. He also said, "The machine gun is already loaded, and my enemies are attacking me!" He attempted to silence the masses and continued to act as "chief," going to various groups to "inspect" and suppress the masses' exposure of him. In the Armed Forces Department under Li Xiaobo's "rule," the atmosphere of democracy was already very thin, and with his ill-intentioned suppression, the general staff were not active in the movement, and at the beginning of the self-criticism, they only criticized personal trivial matters and dared not expose his embezzlement. The leadership of the Public Security Department, based on this situation in the Armed Forces Department, sent an inspection team to conduct the campaign there in a vigorous manner. Li Xiaobo still insisted on his mistakes, saying, "Since you are focusing on me, then come and inspect!" When the comrades of the inspection team talked to him about problems, he shirked all responsibility, saying, "I am a bureaucrat, I don't know anything, you ask the people 'below'!"

On January 8, Zhang Xianjin, Director of the Chahar Provincial Public Security Department, at the Second Mobilization Meeting of the Public Security Department, again called on all cadres to break through all misgivings, be responsible to the Party and the people, and boldly expose corruption and waste. He repeatedly emphasized that the leadership would definitely support the masses who made accusations to the end! And he announced the dismissal of Li Xiaobo on the spot. He said, "Anyone who dares to suppress democracy will be dealt with like Li Xiaobo!"

The inspection team sent by the Public Security Department to the Armed Forces Department immediately held a discussion meeting and conducted individual talks to encourage the masses to make accusations. In the past two days, it has been initially found that Li Xiaobo embezzled and wasted more than 10 million yuan of state wealth. The masses are still continuing their investigation.

    李笑波贪污浪费压制民主已被撤职
    察哈尔省公安厅武装处副处长李笑波，贪污、浪费行为和官僚主义作风十分严重，在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，压制民主，阻挠运动向前发展，省公安厅领导方面已撤了他的职，武装处反对贪污浪费的斗争，也就跟着开展起来了。
    这次运动一开始，公安厅领导方面为了纠正李笑波等腐化堕落的危险倾向，决定以武装处作为运动的重点之一。这正是李笑波肃清资产阶级腐朽思想影响的好机会。可是他却很不满意地说：“我有什么可以反的呢？在北京我老早把报告听饱了！”他在本机关作动员报告时，光说自己的官僚主义作风，捎带了一下浪费，却根本不提他的贪污行为。他很怕大家检举他，在学习文件时，威胁干部说：“谁要捕风捉影，谁就是我的敌人，我就消灭他！”    李笑波竟敢站在敌对的立场上来对抗运动。他还说：“机关枪已经上了带子，我的敌人已经向我进攻了！”他企图堵住群众的嘴，仍以“首长”自居，到各个小组“巡视”，压制群众对他的揭发。李笑波“统治”下的武装处，民主空气本来就很稀薄，他又这样居心不良地压制，因此一般人员对运动都不积极，检查时，开头只是检查个人的身边琐事，不敢揭发他的贪污行为。公安厅领导方面根据武装处这种情况，派检查组去那里大张旗鼓地搞。李笑波还坚持错误，说什么“既然拿我作重点，就来检查吧！”检查组的同志和他谈问题，他一推六二五地说：“我是官僚主义，什么也不知道，你们问‘下边’的人去吧！”
    一月八日，察哈尔省公安厅厅长张献金，在公安厅第二次动员大会上，又号召全体干部打破一切顾虑，向党、向人民负责，大胆地揭发贪污、浪费行为。他反复地强调指出：领导方面一定给检举的群众撑腰到底！并当场宣布撤销李笑波的职务。他说：“谁敢压制民主，就要像李笑波一样地处理！”
    公安厅去武装处的检查组，紧跟着召开座谈会，进行个别谈话启发群众检举，两天来已经初步检查出李笑波贪污、浪费国家财富一千多万元。群众还在继续检查中。
