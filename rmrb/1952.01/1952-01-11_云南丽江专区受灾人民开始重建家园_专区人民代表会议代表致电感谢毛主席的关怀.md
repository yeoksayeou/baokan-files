Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 10th: The people of all ethnic groups in Lijiang Special District, Yunnan Province, who were affected by the earthquake, have begun to rebuild their homes under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government.

Since the earthquake in Lijiang District on December 21 last year, the Lijiang Local Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Lijiang Special Office, and the Lijiang Border Defense Force of the People's Liberation Army have organized emergency rescue work groups to carry out emergency rescue. Everyone selflessly rescued the wounded and the dead. Some People's Liberation Army soldiers ran into houses that were about to collapse to rescue the injured, and took off their cotton coats to give to the victims, who were extremely moved. Many victims rescued their portraits of Chairman Mao from their homes and hung them on trees. They said, "With Chairman Mao, we are not afraid of any disasters."

A large number of relief grain, medicines, and relief funds allocated by the Central People's Government, the Southwest Military and Political Committee, the Yunnan Provincial Military and Political Committee, and the Provincial People's Government have been successively transported to the disaster area. The health department of the People's Liberation Army and a work team composed of more than 150 medical workers from Kunming set up large-scale temporary hospitals and mobile medical teams in the disaster area to carry out medical work intensively. People from all walks of life in Yunnan Province responded to the call of the Yunnan Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference and launched a mass disaster relief campaign. The people of Kunming City alone donated more than 80,000 pieces of clothing and 1 billion yuan in relief funds. Farmers in villages less severely affected by the disaster also automatically sent firewood and rice to the severely affected villages.

At present, the people in the disaster area have obtained relief grain and built temporary shelters; the injured have been sent to temporary hospitals for treatment, and the slightly injured who remained in the villages have been treated by mobile medical teams; the dead have been buried. People have universally organized mutual aid teams for production and disaster relief, rushing to repair houses, canals, and roads, and beginning to rebuild their homes.

The delegates to the Second Session of the Second People's Congress of All Ethnic Groups and All Circles in Lijiang District specially sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, the Southwest Military and Political Committee, the Yunnan Provincial Military and Political Committee, and the Provincial People's Government to express their respect. In their telegram to Chairman Mao, they said: Thanks to the concern and relief of Chairman Mao and the People's Government, the lives of the victims have been stabilized; we vow to respond actively to the call to increase production and practice economy, further strengthen national unity, complete the land reform in the interior, and consolidate national defense with practical actions to repay Chairman Mao's concern.

    云南丽江专区受灾人民开始重建家园
    专区人民代表会议代表致电感谢毛主席的关怀
    【新华社昆明十日电】云南丽江专区因地震受灾的各族人民，在人民政府的领导和帮助下，已开始重建家园。
    丽江区自去年十二月二十一日地震成灾后，中国共产党丽江地方委员会、丽江专署和人民解放军丽江边防部队便组织了急救工作组进行急救。大家忘我地救死扶伤，有些人民解放军战士跑进快要倒塌的房子里抢救负伤的人，并脱下自己的棉衣给灾民穿，灾民们极受感动。许多灾民把家里的毛主席照片抢出来，挂到树上，他们说：“有了毛主席，什么灾难都不怕了。”
    中央人民政府、西南军政委员会、云南省军政委员会和省人民政府所拨发的大批救济粮食、药品及救济金，陆续运到了灾区。人民解放军卫生部门和昆明一百五十多名医务工作者所组成的工作队，在灾区设置了大规模的临时医院和巡回医疗队，紧张地进行医疗工作。云南省各界人民响应省各界人民协商委员会的号召，开展了群众性的救灾运动，仅昆明市人民便捐出八万多件衣物和十亿元救济金。灾区受灾较轻的农民也自动地向重灾村寨送柴、送米。
    目前，灾区人民已经获得救济粮，并搭起了住宿的草棚；负伤的人都被送到临时医院治疗，留在村里的轻伤者由巡回医疗队来诊治，死者都已安葬。人们普遍组织了生产救灾的互助组，赶修房屋、水渠和道路，开始重建家园。
    丽江区各族各界人民代表会议第二届第二次会议全体代表，特地致电毛主席、周总理、西南军政委员会、云南省军政委员会和省人民政府致敬。他们在给毛主席的电文中说：由于毛主席和人民政府的关怀和救济，灾民生活已得到安定；我们誓以积极响应增产节约号召、进一步加强民族团结、完成内地的土地改革、巩固国防的实际行动，来报答毛主席的关怀。
