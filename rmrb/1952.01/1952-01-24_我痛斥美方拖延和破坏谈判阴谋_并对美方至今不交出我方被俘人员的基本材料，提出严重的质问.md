Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 23rd. At the third item agenda subcommittee meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 22nd, the opposing representative claimed that the opposing side did not require our side to make any changes to the provisions of the January 9th proposal, but only hoped to add a restriction on airport equipment within Korea. After the meeting, the opposing side absurdly publicized this as a sign of concession on their part. At the subcommittee meeting on the 23rd, our representative vehemently denounced the opposing side's despicable trick of attempting to deceive the people of the world. Our representative pointed out: Our January 9th proposal, on the one hand, agreed to the replacement of military equipment within a reasonable scope as repeatedly insisted upon by the opposing side, and on the other hand, rejected the opposing side's unreasonable demand to interfere in our internal affairs by restricting airport equipment. The fairness and reasonableness of our proposal has long been recognized by the people of the world, and has been powerfully confirmed by the fact that the opposing side has been rendered speechless and in a difficult position in the meetings in recent days. The current problem lies in whether the opposing side will withdraw its unreasonable demand to restrict airports, which interferes in our internal affairs. Only if the opposing side withdraws this unreasonable demand will it be sufficient to show that the opposing side has the minimum sincerity to reach a ceasefire agreement, and there is no question of any concession. If the opposing side insists on this unreasonable demand, then the opposing side must be responsible for this delay and sabotage of the negotiations.

At the fourth item agenda subcommittee meeting, our representative raised serious questions to the opposing side for still failing to hand over the basic materials related to our captured personnel. When the two sides exchanged basic information on prisoners of war on December 18, our side submitted complete and comprehensive materials on the opposing side's captured personnel, but the list submitted by the opposing side was just a pile of names spelled in English. Our side immediately pointed out to the opposing side at that time that the opposing side should supplement the Korean and Chinese names, ranks, and unit information of our captured personnel, and the opposing side also promised to supplement the information immediately, but it has never handed over the basic identification materials. After a preliminary review of the sloppy list submitted by the opposing side, our side immediately discovered that the actual number of names differed from the total number of names claimed by the opposing side by 1,456 people, and compared with the list of prisoners of war transferred by the opposing side through the International Committee of the Red Cross, there were even 44,205 people missing. Our side subsequently requested the opposing side to supplement information on the whereabouts of the 1,456 discrepancies and the 44,205 missing captured personnel. Although the opposing side repeatedly claimed that it would hand it over soon, it repeatedly delayed, and has not yet handed it over. On December 31, the opposing representative claimed: "Regarding the materials of 44,205 people, I can give it to you on January 2nd." On January 3, the opposing side claimed: "Regarding the issue of 44,205 people, please rest assured, don't lose sleep over it, the materials will be handed over to you when they are ready. I will say it again, they have not disappeared." On January 10, the opposing side claimed: "I'm sorry, my side cannot hand over the materials to your side yet, because the mimeograph machine is broken." By January 12, the opposing side said: "Before we reach an agreement, these materials are not needed by your side." Our representative sternly pointed out at the meeting on the 23rd that the opposing side has no reason to continue to delay and not hand over the basic materials related to our captured personnel, and demanded that the opposing side give a clear and affirmative answer as to when it can be handed over. However, the opposing side continued to equivocate and avoided answering directly, which shows that on the issue of exchanging prisoners, just as on the issue of supervising the implementation of the ceasefire clauses, the opposing side does not intend to solve any problems, but attempts to continue to delay and even sabotage the negotiations.

Opposing side aircraft wantonly bombed our Jiangdong prisoner of war camp on January 14, killing and wounding 79 opposing side prisoners of war. This tragedy caused a shock to world opinion. In order to shirk responsibility, the opposing side proposed the establishment of a prisoner of war safety team at the fourth item agenda subcommittee meeting to study specific measures to protect prisoners of war on both sides. In order to eliminate any excuse for the opposing side to wantonly bomb prisoner of war camps in the future, I expressed my agreement and suggested that immediately after the subcommittee meeting on the 23rd, staff officers from both sides begin exchanging the precise addresses of prisoner of war camps on both sides and study the establishment of signs and other issues.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 22nd. At the third item agenda subcommittee meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 22nd, the opposing side adopted a blatant attitude of delaying negotiations for the third consecutive day. It suggested adjournment shortly after the meeting began. The meeting lasted only fifteen minutes. Our representative sternly pointed out that it has been thirteen days since our side proposed the January 9th plan, and the opposing side has never been able to put forward any tenable arguments to oppose our plan in the meetings. In the past two days, it has been even more speechless and has openly adopted an attitude of delaying negotiations. Outside the meeting, the opposing side has taken continuous provocative actions. The opposing side's chief representative even arrogantly clamored in the "U.S. News & World Report" weekly that only new military pressure could break the stalemate in the negotiations, "Perhaps the opposing side only understands the language of bombs and bullets," which fully proves the opposing side's intention to delay and sabotage the ceasefire negotiations. However, no matter what delaying tactics and overestimating threats the opposing side takes, it cannot shake our firm and unshakable position of not allowing interference in internal affairs.

At the fourth item agenda subcommittee meeting, our representative vehemently denounced the opposing side's absurd argument that if all prisoners of war were repatriated, it would generate "military benefits" for our side. Our representative pointed out that, according to the opposing side's argument, not only must both sides capture an equal number of prisoners of war in order to carry out the so-called "one-to-one exchange," but also scales must be set up at the exchange site to measure the weight and height of the prisoners of war, check the health status of the prisoners of war, and test the military training level of the prisoners of war, in order to make the so-called equivalent exchange so that neither side can get any military benefits. Based on this merchant's point of view that starts from buying and selling people and slave trading, no wonder the opposing side once compared prisoners of war to "pigs in sacks," but this absurd argument and plan has long been rejected by the people of the world and is absolutely unacceptable to our side. The opposing side sent hundreds of instructors from Taiwan to the prisoner of war camps to coerce and create the so-called "Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps," and barbarously forced tattoos on the prisoners of war, which fully exposed the essence of the opposing side's so-called "free choice" and "voluntary repatriation." Our representative pointed out that our side will never allow the principle of unconditional release and repatriation of all prisoners of war to be violated and undermined under any pretext.

    我痛斥美方拖延和破坏谈判阴谋
    并对美方至今不交出我方被俘人员的基本材料，提出严重的质问
    【新华社开城二十三日电】二十二日对方代表在朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上声称，对方并不要求我方对一月九日提案条文作任何更改，而只希望增加一项关于朝鲜境内机场设备的限制。会后，对方竟荒谬地宣传说这是对方让步的表示。我方代表在二十三日的小组委员会上，痛斥对方这种企图欺骗世界人民的可耻伎俩。我方代表指出：我方一月九日的提案，一方面同意了对方所一再坚持的得在合理范围内进行军事装备的替换，另一方面，拒绝了对方干涉我方内政的所谓限制机场设备的无理要求。我方提案的公平合理性早为世界人民所公认，更为对方连日来在会议中陷于理屈词穷的境地，而有力地证实了。目前的问题在于对方是否撤回其干涉我方内政的限制机场的无理要求，只有对方撤消这一无理要求，才足以表示对方有达成停战协议的起码诚意，而根本谈不到是什么让步。如果对方坚持这一无理要求，则对方必须对这种拖延和破坏谈判负责。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表对对方至今仍未交来有关我方被俘人员的基本材料，提出严重的质问。十二月十八日双方交换战俘基本材料时，我方提交了对方被俘人员的充分而完整的材料，但对方所交出的名单却只是一堆用英文拚写的姓名。我方当时即向对方指出对方应该补交我方被俘人员的朝、中文姓名和级别与部别等识别材料，对方当时也应允即日补交，但却始终未能交出基本的识别材料。就对方所交来的潦草名单加以初步的审查，我方当时即发现名单中实有姓名与对方所称姓名总数相差一千四百五十六人，而与对方经由红十字国际委员会转交的战俘名单相比较，更缺少了四万四千二百零五人之多。我方随后向对方提出要求补交有关一千四百五十六名的差额，和四万四千二百零五名我方被俘人员的下落后，对方虽然一再声称即将交出，但也一再拖延，至今仍未交来。十二月三十一日对方代表声称：“关于四万四千二百零五人的材料，一月二日可以交你。”一月三日对方声称：“关于四万四千二百零五人的问题，请你放心，不必为此而失眠，材料整理好了便交给你。我再说一遍他们没有失踪。”一月十日对方声称：“我抱歉，我方还不能将材料交给你方，因为油印机出了毛病。”到了一月十二日，对方却说：“在我们未达成协议前，这些材料对你方是不需要的。”我方代表在二十三日的会上严词指出，对方没有任何理由继续拖延而不交出有关我方被俘人员的基本材料，要求对方明确肯定地答复何时可交出。但对方仍然支吾其词，避免正面答复，可见对方在交换俘虏问题上，也如在监督停战条款实施问题上一样，不打算解决任何问题，而企图继续拖延甚至破坏谈判。
    对方飞机在一月十四日滥炸我江东俘虏营，死伤对方被俘人员七十九名。这一惨剧引起世界舆论的震动，对方为推卸责任，在第四项议程的小组委员会上提议成立战俘安全小组，研讨保护双方战俘的具体办法。为了解除对方今后恣意轰炸俘虏营的一切藉口，我表示同意并建议即在二十三日的小组会后，由双方参谋人员开始交换双方俘虏营的精确地址并研讨设立标志等问题。
    【新华社开城二十二日电】二十二日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上，对方连续第三天采取了露骨的拖延谈判的态度。开会不久，即行建议休会。会议历时仅十五分钟。我方代表严词指出，自从我方提出一月九日的方案以来已经有十三天，对方在会内从来没有能够提出任何站得住的论点来反对我方方案。最近两天来更是理屈词穷，公然地采取了拖延谈判的态度。在会外对方更采取了连续挑衅行为。对方首席代表更在“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊报狂妄的叫嚣可能只有新的军事压力才能打开谈判的僵局，“可能对方只懂得炸弹与枪弹的语言”，更充分地证明了对方拖延并破坏停战谈判的意图。但不论对方采取任何拖延谈判的伎俩和不自量力的威胁，都不能动摇我方不容许干涉内政的坚决不可动摇的立场。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表痛斥对方所谓如果遣返全体战俘即将对我方产生“军事利益”的荒谬论点。我方代表指出，根据对方的论点，不但双方必须俘获同等数目的战俘，以便进行所谓“一对一的交换”，而且更须在交换地点设立磅秤测量战俘的体重身长，检查战俘的健康状况，测验战俘的军训水平，以便作所谓同等的交换，使任何一方得不到任何军事利益。根据这种从买卖人口和奴隶交易的商人观点出发，无怪乎对方曾将战俘比喻作“麻袋中的猪”，但这种荒谬论点和方案早为世界人民所唾弃，是我方所绝对不能容许的。对方在战俘营中自台湾派来数百名的教官威迫制造所谓“反共救国团”，在战俘身上野蛮地强迫刺字等，更十足地暴露了对方所谓“自由选择”和“自愿遣返”的本质。我方代表指出：我方将决不容许在任何藉口之下，违反和破坏无条件释放与遣返全体战俘的原则。
