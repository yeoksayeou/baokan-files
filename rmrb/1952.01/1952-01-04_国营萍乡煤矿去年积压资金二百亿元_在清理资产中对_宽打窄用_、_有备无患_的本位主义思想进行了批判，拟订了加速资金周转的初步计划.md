    State-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine Had 20 Billion Yuan in Accumulated Funds Last Year
    Criticized Departmentalism with the Ideologies of "Generous Budgeting and Economical Spending" and "Preparedness Prevents Calamity" During Asset Clearance; Drafted a Preliminary Plan to Accelerate Capital Turnover
    During the asset clearance and capital verification work, the state-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine exposed a serious waste of a large amount of accumulated circulating capital in 1951. Preliminary calculations show that the mine accumulated 20 billion yuan last year, more than double its actual capital needs. Because leading cadres did not manage the enterprise with careful calculation, although the mine inventoried assets during the takeover and cleaned the warehouse the year before last, it was all "counting according to the books." They never really figured out how much property they had, and their supply and storage of materials were not based on actual production needs, but rather buying and storing as they pleased, without any planning. As a result, a large amount of capital was accumulated. During this asset clearance, more than 40 types of equipment that had never been used were found in the warehouse. Among them, triangular rubber belts, canvas rubber belts, copper sheets, and adhesive tape cables were all expensive materials. They accumulated ten tons of valuable hollow hexagonal steel, which the unit did not need at all, and did not hand it over. There were more than 20 types of materials with very small actual consumption but very large storage, such as cables that could last for 14 years based on the mine's actual consumption last year, wires that could last for more than four years, copper, steel cables, tools, instruments, various spare parts, and various non-metallic products that could last for more than three years, and steel pipes and light bulbs that could last for two and a half years. Some materials were already heavily stocked, and consumption was not high, but they continued to purchase them. For example, the original stock of various specifications of carbon steel was 4,774 kilograms, and only 464 kilograms were used before the end of September last year, but they purchased another 635 kilograms; the original stock of brass ingots was 550 kilograms, only 10 kilograms were used, but they purchased another 323 kilograms. There were also some materials that were not needed at all but were bought in. For example, there were 976 kilograms of various specifications of square steel and 2,157 kilograms of iron sand. The 7,000 meters of cable purchased by the Central South Industrial Department's manager's office could not be used at all because the specifications were not suitable; this item alone accumulated 1 billion yuan. Material management was also extremely chaotic, lacking strict procurement and inspection systems and sound storage, material requisition, and return systems. The phenomena of "black materials" and "small warehouses" were also very common.
    The root cause of this phenomenon is that the leading cadres of this mine have the departmentalist thinking of "generous budgeting and economical spending, and preparedness prevents calamity." They believe that some materials will become less and less available in the market, and some materials will not be supplied regularly, fearing that it will affect production, so they try their best to store them "just in case." For example, wood is the main material for production and capital construction in this mine. They were afraid that the supply would not be regular, so they stored a large amount of it. The balance at the end of September last year was more than 13,000 cubic meters. According to the working capital quota for wood required in 1952, the accumulated capital reached 1.8 billion yuan. They thought that the mine was going to develop anyway, and if they didn't use the materials that they didn't need but should hand over, they would use them next year, or in the future; if they handed them over now, they were afraid that they would not be able to get them when they needed them in the future, resulting in the idea of "laying an ambush." Therefore, they kept good materials and handed over bad materials. For example, there were more than 40 types of equipment in the warehouse that had never been used and more than 20 types of materials with small consumption and large storage, none of which were handed over. When purchasing materials, they had the simple security viewpoint of "as long as it's safe, don't be afraid to spend money," which caused huge waste. For example, last year, the mine purchased 7,200 cubic meters of pit wood from Nanchang Timber Company, overemphasizing security, only buying large wood, and temporarily hiring workers to sort it out; the small wood remaining after sorting was calculated as one-third of the total purchase price to compensate. The extra wages and compensation amounted to 350 million yuan. When workers used this batch of large pit wood, they said: "It's impossible to carry it into the tunnel." As a result, this batch of "pit wood" was stockpiled, or they were split into small pieces for use, causing serious waste.
    After the asset clearance and capital verification, the leading cadres of this mine realized the seriousness of the phenomenon of accumulated capital, criticized various erroneous ideas, and studied the working capital quota and turnover period for this year, and drafted a preliminary plan to accelerate capital turnover, expand the reproduction of the enterprise, and strive to complete the great task of the increase production and practice economy movement.

    国营萍乡煤矿去年积压资金二百亿元
    在清理资产中对“宽打窄用”、“有备无患”的本位主义思想进行了批判，拟订了加速资金周转的初步计划
    国营萍乡煤矿在清理资产核定资金工作中，暴露了在一九五一年积压大量流动资金的严重浪费情况。经初步计算，这个矿在去年积压资金二百亿元，超过了它实际需用的资金一倍以上。因为领导干部没有精打细算地经营企业，所以这个矿虽然在接管时清点过资产，前年又清理过仓库，但都是“照账点数”。他们始终没有弄清家当究竟有多大，对材料的供应和储备，也不是根据生产的实际需要情况，而是想买就买，想存就存，毫无计划。因此，造成了大量积压资金的现象。在这次清理资产时，发现了放在仓库里的从未动用过的器材有四十多种。其中如三角橡皮带、帆布橡皮带、紫铜板、胶布电缆等，都是价值昂贵的材料。他们积压了十吨贵重的空心六角钢，本单位根本用不着，又不上缴。实际用量很小而储存量却非常大的材料计有二十多种，如以这个矿去年实际用量计算，其中电缆可用十四年，电线可用四年多，铜材、钢索、工具、仪器、各种零星配件以及各种非金属制品等都可用三年多，钢铁管、电灯泡等可用两年半。有些材料的储存量已很多，用量又不大，但他们仍继续购进。如原存各种规范的炭素钢四千七百七十四公斤，在去年九月底以前只用了四百六十四公斤，而他们又购进了六百三十五公斤；原存黄铜元五百五十公斤，只用了十公斤，又购进了三百二十三公斤。还有些材料是根本不需用的，却被买进来了。如各种规范的方钢有九百七十六公斤，铁砂有二千一百五十七公斤。中南工业部经理处代购的电缆七千公尺，因规格不合，根本不能用；只这一项就积压资金十亿元之多。材料管理工作上也极为混乱，缺乏严格的采购、检验制度和健全的保管、领料、退料制度，“黑料”“小仓库”等现象，也很普遍。
    产生这种现象的根本原因，是这个矿的领导干部有“宽打窄用，有备无患”的本位主义思想。他们认为有些材料在市场上会越买越少，有些材料供应不会经常，怕影响生产，因而尽力储备，“以防万一”。如木材是这个矿生产上和基本建设上的主要材料，他们怕供应不常，就大量储存，去年九月底的结存量有一万三千多立方公尺。如按照一九五二年木材需用的流动资金定额计算，积压资金达十八亿元。他们对于本单位用不着而应当上缴的材料，认为矿山反正是要发展的，今年不用明年用，现在不用将来用；现在上缴了，将来需用时又怕得不到手，产生了“打埋伏”的思想。因而就多留好料，上缴坏料。如仓库里有四十多种从来没有动用的器材和二十多种用量小存量大的材料，都不上缴。在采购材料时，有着“只要保安，不怕花钱”的单纯保安观点，因而造成了巨大浪费。如去年这个矿向南昌木材公司购买七千二百立方公尺坑木，过分强调保安，只选购大木，临时雇工散排挑选；把挑选后剩余的小木以所购总数的三分之一计算补价。多花的工资和补价达三亿五千万元。工人在使用这批大坑木时说：“简直没法背到坑道里去。”因而就把这批“坑木”积压起来，或者把它们劈成小木来用，造成严重的浪费。
    经过清理资产核定资金以后，这个矿的领导干部认识了积压资金现象的严重性，对各种错误思想进行了批判，并对今年的流动资金定额、周转期等，进行了研究，拟订了初步计划，使资金加速周转，扩大企业的再生产，争取完成增产节约运动的伟大任务。（中南工业部通讯组）
