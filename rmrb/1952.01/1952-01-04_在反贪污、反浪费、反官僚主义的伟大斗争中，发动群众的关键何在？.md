In the current anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement across the country, although it has been launched one after another, the development of this movement is still very uneven, very ununiversal, and very superficial. In various regions, departments, and at all levels of government, the development of the movement can be roughly divided into three types: good, relatively good, and not good. The distinguishing mark of these three situations is the degree of mass mobilization. Wherever the masses have been fully mobilized, the movement has been carried out well; where the masses have been initially mobilized but not sufficiently, the development of the movement is not good enough; where the masses have basically not been mobilized, the movement cannot be carried out or is carried out very poorly. At present, many units, many departments, and many regions belong to the third situation, which is an unsatisfactory situation. All those who care about the interests of the people and the country cannot tolerate this situation continuing to exist and must immediately change it. It is imperative that we fully mobilize the masses without exception throughout the country, in all party organizations, all government departments and military departments, all state-owned and public-owned industrial, transportation, banking, and trade agencies and enterprises, all cooperative organizations, youth league organizations, and leading organs of people's organizations at all levels, and all private industrial and commercial enterprises that have relations with the aforementioned parties, to form a broad mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and carry it out resolutely and thoroughly with great fanfare, like the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries.

Where does the situation of insufficient mass mobilization or no mobilization at all come from? The main key here lies in leadership; and the central issue of leadership is "the chief officer takes responsibility and takes action personally." Only in this way can we fully mobilize the masses and lead the movement. At present, in some places, the movement is carried out very well and with great strength, because the responsible chiefs there have regarded this movement as a serious ideological and political struggle, and have taken an active and proactive combat posture, personally "going to the front line" without any timidity or procrastination. Conversely, the reason why there are still many unsatisfactory situations at present is that some chiefs are irresponsible, do not take action personally, lack fighting spirit, are timid, are in a passive position, and even slack off.

Since these people are chiefs (no matter what level of chief they are), why are they not responsible and do not take action personally to mobilize the masses? Facts tell us that there are currently two types of people who cannot mobilize the masses. One type of person does not have a sufficient understanding of the great political significance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. They do not understand that if the serious phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are not thoroughly eliminated, they will corrode our party, corrode our government, corrode our army, corrode all financial and economic institutions and all revolutionary mass organizations, bring disgrace to many of our cadres, and cause great disasters to our country—in a word, there is a danger of losing the party, the country, and one's own life. They do not understand these things, but regard this movement as trivial, and take a bureaucratic attitude, entrusting their leadership responsibilities to assistants or secretaries. The masses, seeing this attitude of the leaders, also begin to hesitate and watch. This kind of person has a dull political sense and a bureaucratic work style, and they should wake up quickly now and should no longer hesitate.

The other type of person has unclean hands themselves. They are afraid that mobilizing the masses will be detrimental to them, so they try to cover up the phenomena of corruption and waste in various ways, find all kinds of excuses, and take a passive, perfunctory, and outwardly compliant attitude towards leading the movement, and some even openly come out to resist. In fact, they are already in an extremely passive position in the movement. If they still do not come to their senses and continue to take a slack and resistant attitude, they will inevitably become an obstacle to the mass anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and become the object of mass struggle.

In fact, the masses will never tolerate any acts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The masses will definitely act under the call of the Central Committee. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government and its Military Commission, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are firmly leading and supporting this just mass struggle. No one should妄想(wangxiang - vainly attempt) to resist this sacred struggle, no responsible person is allowed to neglect or abandon the responsibility of leading this struggle, and no one can slack off.

So, what should be the correct attitude? The correct attitude is to conduct open self-criticism and strive to take the initiative. If one has made the mistake of bureaucracy, one should earnestly and openly examine one's own bureaucracy in order to gain the trust of the masses and continue to lead them. If one's own hands are not clean, one should even more openly confess one's mistakes to the masses, explain everything to the masses without reservation, and let the masses expose and report all errors or evils of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy without any scruples.

If someone is obstinate and dares to defy the Central Committee's instructions and hinder the mass movement, no matter how high his position or how old his qualifications are, his superiors should resolutely dismiss him. If one hinders the mass movement because one's own hands are not clean, one should not only be dismissed, but also be punished by law; if he is a member of the Communist Party, he should be punished by Party discipline.

As early as December 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong emphatically instructed us: "We absolutely cannot allow the phenomena of acting independently, engaging in independent kingdoms, undermining policies, undermining laws, infringing upon the interests of the people, fighting and hindering each other among units, and corruption, waste, and gambling among cadres to happen again. If such phenomena occur again, discipline must be strictly enforced, with criticism for minor offenses and punishment for serious offenses, and we must never condone them and praise them as 'leniency'." Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out that "those who are incompetent and those who have committed corruption and corruption errors must be transferred, and some particularly serious ones must be given the punishment they deserve." Now the people we see who are hindering the mass movement are nothing more than these two types. Those who take a bureaucratic attitude and fail to mobilize the masses are incompetent people; those who fail to mobilize the masses because their own hands are not clean are people who have committed corruption and corruption errors. Is there any reason why discipline should not be strictly enforced against these two types of people?

Of course, for those who are so-called "hands not clean," we should also distinguish between the seriousness of the case, conduct in-depth investigations, and deal with them realistically. At the same time, for those who have been consistently loyal and devoted to the cause of the people's revolution, have made meritorious contributions, have occasionally stumbled, and have made minor mistakes but can quickly confess and examine themselves, we should also consider reducing or exempting them from punishment. However, large embezzlers such as Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan are unforgivable, no matter how great their achievements. We must eliminate as many such traitors and vermin as there are. Eliminating them is not a loss to the party, but a victory for the party, and it does not reduce the party's prestige, but enhances it. Only by resolutely doing so can we strengthen and consolidate our party and the ranks of the people's revolution and prevent them from being corroded by the ideology of the exploiting classes.

This anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is an extremely important test for every revolutionary cadre, especially for the leading cadres at all levels in various regions, departments, and agencies and units, and especially for the Communist Party members among them. It tests our fundamental political stance and tests our firmness and thoroughness in the cause of the Party and the people's revolution. In this major political struggle, every loyal Communist Party member should bravely stand at the forefront, resolutely lead the masses to struggle, and quickly achieve a complete victory.

### 在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争中，发动群众的关键何在？

    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争中，发动群众的关键何在？
    目前全国各地反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，虽然已经先后开展起来了，但是，这个运动的发展还很不平衡、很不普遍、很不深入。在各地区、各部门和各级机关中，运动发展的情况大体上可以分为三种：好的、较好的和不好的。区别这三种情况的标志是群众发动的程度。凡是把群众充分发动起来了的，运动就开展得好；初步发动了群众但发动得不充分的，运动的开展就还不够好；群众基本上没有被发动起来的，运动就不能开展或开展得很不好。目前有不少的单位、不少的部门、不少的地区是属于第三种情况的，这是不能令人满意的情况。一切关心人民和国家利益的人，都不能容忍这种情况继续存在下去，而必须立即加以改变。必须立即在全国范围内，在一切党组织，一切政府部门和军事部门，一切国营和公营的工业、交通、银行、贸易的机关和事业，一切合作社组织，青年团组织和人民团体的各级领导机关，以及一切和上述各方发生关系的私人工商事业，都应毫无例外地充分发动群众，把反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争，形成一个广泛的群众运动，如同镇压反革命的运动一样，大张旗鼓地雷厉风行地坚决进行到底。
    群众没有充分发动或根本没有发动的情况是从何而来的呢？这里的主要关键就在于领导；而领导问题的中心就是要“首长负责，亲自动手”。只有这样，才能充分发动群众，把运动领导起来。目前有的地方，运动开展得很好，很有力量，就因为那里的负责首长，把这个运动当作一场严重的思想斗争和政治斗争，积极主动地采取战斗的姿态，亲自“上前线”，毫无畏首畏尾、拖泥带水的模样。反之，目前所以还有不少令人不满的情况存在，就因为有些首长不负责任，不亲自动手，缺乏战斗精神，畏首畏尾，陷于被动，甚至于消极怠工的缘故。
    这些人既然身为首长（不管他是那一级的首长），为什么却不负责任、不亲自动手去发动群众呢？事实告诉我们，目前有两种人是不能发动群众的。一种人是对于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的重大政治意义认识不足的。他们不了解，对于贪污、浪费和官僚主义的严重现象，如果不加以彻底肃清，它们就要腐蚀我们的党，腐蚀我们的政府，腐蚀我们的军队，腐蚀一切财政经济机构和一切革命的群众组织，使我们的许多干部人员身败名裂，给我们的国家造成极大的灾害，一句话，这就有亡党、亡国、亡身的危险。他们不了解这些，却把这个运动视同等闲，采取了官僚主义的态度，把自己的领导责任，委托在助手或秘书等人身上。群众看到领导人的这种态度，也就彷徨观望起来。这种人是政治嗅觉不灵敏而有官僚主义作风的，他们现在应该猛醒过来，再也不应该犹疑了。
    另一种人是自己手上不干净，他们害怕发动群众对自己不利，因而多方掩饰贪污浪费的现象，找出各种藉口，对运动的领导采取消极怠工、阳奉阴违的态度，有些甚至公开出面抵抗。事实上，他们在运动中已经处于极端被动的地位。如果他们仍不觉悟，并且继续采取怠工和抵抗态度的话，他们就必然成为群众反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的障碍，成为群众斗争的对象。
    事实上群众对于一切贪污、浪费和官僚主义的行为，是决不能容忍的。群众是一定会在中央号召之下行动起来的。以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央和中央人民政府及其军事委员会，是坚决领导和支持这种正义的群众斗争的。任何人也休要妄想抵抗这个神圣的斗争，任何负责人员也不容许忽视或放弃领导这个斗争的责任，任何人也不可以怠工。
    那末，正确的态度应该怎么样呢？正确的态度是公开检讨、争取主动。如果自己犯了官僚主义的错误，就应该认真地公开检讨自己的官僚主义，才能取得群众的信任，继续领导群众。如果自己手上不干净，更应该公开地向群众坦白认错，毫无保留地向群众交代清楚，并且让群众毫无顾忌地揭发和检举一切贪污浪费和官僚主义的错误或罪恶。
    如果有人执迷不悟，胆敢违抗中央指示，阻碍群众运动，无论他的职位有多么高，资格有多么老，他的上级都应该坚决把他撤职。如果因为自己手上不干净而阻碍群众运动的，就不但应该撤职，还应该受到法律处分；如果他是共产党员更应该受到党的纪律处分。
    毛泽东同志远在一九四二年十二月，就已经强调地指示我们：“绝对不容许再有各自为政、闹独立性、破坏政策、破坏法令、侵害人民利益、各单位互相斗争、互相妨碍、以及干部中贪污浪费赌博等现象再行发生。如再有这类现象发生，必须严申纪律，轻者批评，重者处罚，决不可对他们纵容，反而美其名曰‘宽大政策’。”毛泽东同志又指出，对于“不称职的及犯贪污腐化错误的人必须调动工作，有些特别严重的并须予以应得的处罚。”现在我们所看到的阻碍群众运动的人，也不外这两种。采取官僚主义态度而不发动群众的，就是不称职的人；因为自己手上不干净而不发动群众的，就是犯贪污腐化错误的人。对于这两种人难道还有丝毫理由不应该严申纪律吗？
    当然，对于所谓“手上不干净”的，还应该区别轻重大小，经过深入的调查，实事求是地分别处理。同时，对于一贯忠心耿耿为人民革命事业奋斗有功，偶尔失足，错误不大而能迅速坦白检讨的，也应该考虑减轻处分或免予处分。但是，像刘青山、张子善等大贪污犯，则不论他们有多大功劳，都是不可宽恕的了。对于这样的叛徒和毒虫，有多少就必须清除多少。清除了他们，不是党的损失，而是党的胜利，不是降低党的威信，而是提高党的威信。只有坚决地这样做，才能使我们的党和人民革命的队伍坚强和巩固起来，永不再受剥削阶级思想的腐蚀。
    这个反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，对于每个革命工作干部，特别是对于各地区、各部门和各机关单位的各级主要负责干部，尤其是对于其中的共产党员，是一个极重要的考验。它考验着我们的根本政治立场，考验着我们对于党和人民革命事业的坚定性和彻底性。在这个重大的政治斗争中，每一个忠诚的共产党员都应该勇敢地站在最前列，坚决地领导群众起来斗争，迅速地取得完全的胜利。
