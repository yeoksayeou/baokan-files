    To the Editor: We are cement workers working at the An'nan Camp construction site of the Beijing Construction Engineering Company. The contract signed by both parties stipulated that after the completion of the project, we would receive a bonus of more than 1.9 million yuan. Afterwards, the site accountant, Wang Ronghui, used the excuse that we did not have seals and that the calculation was not clear, so he did not issue the bonus. At that time, we had no work to do and could not stay for a long time, so we had to go home. According to some workers living in Beijing, they had received the bonus, but it took a lot of effort to get it. There is still more than 1.7 million yuan in bonuses that have not been paid out, and Wang Ronghui has embezzled it. During work, Wang Ronghui deducted our drinking water money. Although the trade union corrected this, Wang still ignored it. He embezzled the water money. The director of this construction site, Shen Hongtao, knew about the above situation, but not only did he not punish Wang, but he also trusted him very much. We believe that the leading cadres of the Beijing Construction Engineering Company should promptly deal with this issue.

    北京市建筑工程公司安南营工地
    会计员王荣辉贪污工人奖金应速处理
    编辑同志：我们是打洋灰工人，在北京市建筑工程公司安南营工地做工。在双方所订的合同上，规定工程完毕后，我们可得奖金一百九十多万元。事后，工地会计人员王荣辉藉口我们没有图章，又说还没有算清楚，不发给奖金。当时我们无活可做，不能长期久待，只好各自回家。据有些住在北京的工人说，他们已领了奖金，但也是费了很大的劲才得到的。这笔奖金还有一百七十多万元，拖到现在没有发，王荣辉把它吃没了。做工时，王荣辉扣我们的吃水钱。工会虽曾纠正，王却依然不理。他把水钱贪污了。这个工地的主任沈洪涛明知以上情况，不但对王不加制裁，反而非常信任他。我们认为北京市建筑工程公司领导干部应迅速处理这个问题。　打洋灰工人禾木等
