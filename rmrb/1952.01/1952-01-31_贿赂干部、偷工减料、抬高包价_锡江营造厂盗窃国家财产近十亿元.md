    Bribing Cadres, Cutting Corners, Inflating Contract Prices
    Xijiang Construction Company Steals Nearly One Billion Yuan of State Property
    The private Xijiang Construction Company of Xinxiang City, Pingyuan Province, has consistently used despicable means such as bribery and deception to steal materials and cut corners when contracting for projects, causing serious damage to the state and the people's construction endeavors. It is estimated that the state suffered losses of 200 million yuan due to cutting corners and 770 million yuan due to inflating contract prices.
    The Xijiang Construction Company moved from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang in April 1951. The manager, Qin Shaoqun, is an unscrupulous merchant (currently hiding in Hankou). When registering with the Municipal People's Government, he falsely reported a capital of more than 72 million yuan. After fraudulently obtaining a business license, he successively contracted for 140 rooms of barracks for a certain military unit, more than 30 rooms for the Xinxiang County Cotton Improvement Society, and a building for the Provincial Second Hospital. In addition, there were projects for the former Provincial Health Bureau's cadre sanatorium, Pingyuan Provincial Agricultural College, and the Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station. Before contracting for the above projects, he asked the clients for money. After receiving the money, he purchased furniture for the construction company and paid off debts in Zhengzhou and other places. It is understood that of the 140 million yuan for the entire project of the Pingyuan Provincial Health Bureau's cadre sanatorium, the Xijiang Construction Company used more than 70 million yuan. Of the contract fees for the Agricultural Experiment Station and the Agricultural College, more than 360 million yuan was used. Because of the casual use of public funds, the required materials could not be purchased on time, and the start of construction was often delayed.
    After the above projects started, Qin Shaoqun cut corners everywhere and did not act according to the contract. For example, when building the Pingyuan Provincial Second Hospital building, he dug the foundation 1.5 centimeters less, and built two fewer layers of bricks, saving 5,000 bricks. According to the contract, the basement should be a 1:2 ratio of cement, but it was actually a 1:4 ratio of cement, saving more than 20 bags of cement. The toilet cesspool should have used a 1:2 ratio of cement, but in reality, it used yellow earth mixed with lime, which saved another 20 bags of cement. The brick walls were built entirely without sand, but with yellow mud and lime. The amount of lime used was also reduced by about 10,000 jin. The contract stipulated that the floor should be made of brick chips and aggregate, but he used furnace slag. In terms of wood, the purlins used were also about 30 to 40 percent smaller than the original contract standard.
    Because the Xijiang Construction Company only cared about illegally seeking exorbitant profits and disregarded the quality of construction projects, the state's construction efforts suffered great harm. For example, the four gatehouses of Pingyuan Provincial Agricultural College collapsed completely because the beams used were too short. The cement platform of the Provincial Second Hospital leaked as soon as it was built because too little cement was used. Because the beams were not strong enough, the main beam sank ten centimeters when the lower layer of furnace slag was laid.
    The reason why the Xijiang Construction Company was able to cut corners in contracting various projects, in addition to deceiving the clients who did not understand engineering, was mainly because it bribed and bought off the supervisors, using "fellow villagers and friends" to win them over. For example, Chen Shunheng, the supervisor of a certain military unit's barracks, was from Shanghai, as was Lu Xiangrong, the engineer of the Xijiang Construction Company. He was recognized as a "fellow villager," and they first ate and drank together without distinction, and later accepted bribes. It is known that he accepted a bribe of one million yuan on one occasion. Another example is that Qin Shaoqun, the manager of Xijiang Construction Company, recognized Liu Bingzhang (a section chief) in charge of supervision at Pingyuan Provincial Agricultural College as a "fellow villager," and asked people from the factory to eat and drink with Liu Bingzhang all day long. After being bought off, Liu Bingzhang shamelessly said, "I don't mind living this kind of life all day long." As a result, when the Xijiang Construction Company contracted for 78 rooms of the Pingyuan Provincial Agricultural College for the second time in August last year, the contract price was doubled, stealing 800,000 jin of millet from the state, equivalent to 776 million yuan in RMB.
    The Pingyuan Daily demands that the Xinxiang Municipal People's Government severely punish the illegal business practices of the private Xijiang Construction Company in accordance with the law.

### 贿赂干部、偷工减料、抬高包价  锡江营造厂盗窃国家财产近十亿元

    贿赂干部、偷工减料、抬高包价
    锡江营造厂盗窃国家财产近十亿元
    平原省新乡市私营锡江营造厂，在承揽工程中，一贯以行贿、欺骗等卑鄙手段，进行偷工减料，给国家人民建筑事业造成严重损害。计先后用偷工减料方法使国家损失二亿元，用抬高包价方法使国家损失七亿七千万元。
    锡江营造厂在一九五一年四月间由郑州迁到新乡。经理秦绍群是个不法奸商（现潜藏在汉口）。在向市人民政府进行登记时，即空报了资金七千二百多万元。骗取营业证后，相继承包了某部营房一百四十间、新乡县棉业改进社房屋三十多间、省立第二医院楼房一座。此外，还有前省卫生局干部疗养院、平原省农学院、省农业试验场等单位的工程。在承包上述工程之先，就向委托者索要款项。领款后，一方面购置营造厂家具，一方面又到郑州等地还账。据了解：平原省卫生局干部疗养院全部工程经费是一亿四千万元，锡江营造厂就动用了七千多万元。在农业试验场和农学院的承包费中动用了三亿六千多万元。由于随便动用公款，致使所需材料不能按期买到，经常延迟开工期限。
    上述工程开工后，秦绍群则又处处偷工减料，不按合同办事。如修建平原省立第二医院楼房时，把地基少挖了一公寸五分，少砌了两层砖，偷省砖料五千块。按合同规定，地下室应是一比二洋灰，结果按一比四洋灰，少用洋灰二十多袋。厕所粪池用洋灰应是一比二，实际上用的黄土加石灰，这项又偷省洋灰二十多袋。砌砖墙完全没用沙子，而用黄泥、石灰。石灰用量也减省约一万斤。合同规定打地坪要用砖碴三合土，但他用的是炉碴。在木料上，所用檩条也较原合同规定尺寸标准约差百分之三十到四十。
    由于锡江营造厂只顾非法牟取暴利，不顾工程建筑质量，致使国家建设事业遭受危害很大。如平原省农学院门房四间，因用梁过短，结果全部倒塌。省立第二医院洋灰平台，因用洋灰过少，所以打好就漏。楼梁因力量不够，在打下层炉碴时，大梁下沉十公分。
    锡江营造厂所以能够在包揽各项工程中百般偷工减料，除了欺骗委托者不懂工程外，主要的是向监工人员进行了贿赂收买，以“同乡好友”进行拉拢。如某部营房监工陈顺生，同锡江营造厂工程师陆享镕同是上海人，即认成“老乡”，先是吃喝不分，以后便收受贿赂。据已知的一次即受贿一百万元。又如锡江营造厂经理秦绍群和平原省农学院负责监工的刘炳璋（是个科长）认成“老乡”，整天叫厂里的人员和刘炳璋在一起大吃大喝。刘炳璋被收买后，竟无耻地说“整天过这样生活，我也不烦。”结果使锡江营造厂在去年八月第二次承包平原省农学院七十八间房时，包价抬高一倍，盗窃国家财产达八十万斤小米，合人民币七亿七千六百万元。
    对于私营锡江营造厂这种非法经营行为，平原日报要求新乡市人民政府依法予以严惩。
