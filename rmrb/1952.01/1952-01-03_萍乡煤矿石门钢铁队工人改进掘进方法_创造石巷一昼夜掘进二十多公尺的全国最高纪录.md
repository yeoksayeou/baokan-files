    Pingxiang Coal Mine Shimen Steel Team Workers Improve Tunneling Methods
    Creating a National Record of Over 20 Meters of Stone Tunneling in One Day and Night
    Workers of the Shimen Steel Team of the state-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine improved the stone tunnel excavation method, increasing the efficiency of stone tunnel excavation from four meters per day and night to 20.3 meters. This record exceeded the tunneling efficiency stipulated by the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government by more than three times, and also greatly exceeded the previous record of 15.6 meters in one day and night by the No. 81 Team of the Hongshan Coal Mine in Shandong, which had a relatively good stone tunnel excavation efficiency in the past, becoming the national record for stone tunnel excavation.
    The new record of the Shimen Steel Team of Pingxiang Coal Mine was created under the multi-hole cyclic tunneling method. They had repeatedly adopted this method before, but the efficiency was not high. Last year, Pingxiang Coal Mine implemented the new coal mining method and carried out democratic reforms. After Chairman Mao issued the call for increasing production and practicing economy, the coal mining efficiency in the mine rapidly increased, and the speed of opening up new coal mining sites gradually could not keep up with the needs. Under this circumstance, the Shimen Steel Team actively tried to improve tunneling efficiency. After repeated studies, they discovered the shortcomings of using this tunneling method in the past and found ways to improve it. On November 24th, they conducted the experiment again. On this day, the rock layer they excavated was a medium-hard and below medium-hard rock layer. After pulling a groove once, they pulled a groove again in this groove. They also deepened the depth of the drilled holes. The first groove hole was drilled 1.7 meters, the second groove hole was drilled 1.4 meters, and the top, waist, and bottom holes were all drilled 2.5 meters. Because two grooves were pulled in succession, the recessed part in the middle of the rock layer was more than twice as deep as before when only one groove was pulled, so the explosion depth of the surrounding rock layers greatly exceeded the previous depth. The increase in the depth of the drilled holes not only reduced the number of times of drilling, loading explosives, and blasting, and greatly shortened the time, but also improved the explosive power of the explosives and promoted the splitting of the rock. Using this tunneling method, they can cycle tunneling once every six hours, and each time they can tunnel an average of 4.4 meters to 5 meters.
    The Shimen Steel Team has formulated this year's work plan based on this new record. According to this plan, they can save the country wealth equivalent to 675 tons of rice this year just in terms of saving explosives and detonators. However, the realization of this plan requires the mine to carry out comprehensive production reform work, such as further improving the efficiency of coal mining and transportation, and solving the problem of the excessive number of stone tunnel excavation teams caused by this improvement.

    萍乡煤矿石门钢铁队工人改进掘进方法
    创造石巷一昼夜掘进二十多公尺的全国最高纪录
    国营萍乡煤矿石门钢铁队工人改进了石巷掘进方法，使石巷掘进效率由一昼夜四公尺提高到二十点三公尺。这一纪录超过了中央人民政府燃料工业部规定的掘进效率三倍以上，也大大超过了过去国内石巷掘进效率较好的山东洪山煤矿八一队在一昼夜内掘进十五点六公尺的纪录，成为石巷掘进的全国最高纪录。
    萍乡煤矿石门钢铁队的这个新纪录，是在多孔循环掘进方法下创造的。这种方法，他们从前曾一再采用过，但效率都不高。去年萍乡煤矿实行了新采煤法，又进行了民主改革，在毛主席提出增产节约的号召以后，矿内采煤效率迅速提高，开辟新采煤场所的速度已渐渐赶不上需要。在这种情况下，石门钢铁队就积极设法提高掘进效率。他们经过反覆研究，发现了从前运用这种掘进方法的缺点，并且找出了改进的办法。十一月二十四日，他们重新进行了实验。这一天他们掘进的岩层是中硬和中硬以下硬度的岩层。他们拉过一次槽口后，又在这个槽口中再拉了一次槽口。他们又加深了打眼的深度。第一次槽子眼打进了一点七公尺，第二次槽子眼打进了一点四公尺，顶眼、?眼、底眼都打进了二点五公尺。因为接连拉了两次槽口，岩层中部的凹进部分就比从前拉一次槽口时加深了一倍以上，所以四周岩层的爆炸深度就大大超过了以前的深度。打眼的深度增加后，不只使打眼、装炸药、放炮等工作的次数减少，所用的时间大为缩短，而且使炸药的爆炸能力提高，促进了岩石的分裂。他们用这种掘进方法，每六小时就可以循环掘进一次，每次平均能掘进四点四公尺到五公尺。
    石门钢铁队已根据这一新纪录定出了今年工作的计划。根据这个计划，只在节省炸药和雷管方面，他们今年就可以给国家节省等于六百七十五吨大米的财富。但这一计划的实现，还需要矿内进行全面的生产改革工作，如进一步提高采煤和搬运工作的效率，解决由于这一改进而引起的石巷掘进队过多的问题等。    （新华社）
