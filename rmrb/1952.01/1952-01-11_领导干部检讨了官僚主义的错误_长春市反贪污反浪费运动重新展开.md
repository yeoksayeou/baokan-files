Leading Cadres Reviewed Bureaucratic Errors
Changchun City Relaunches Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Campaign

The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in Changchun City has not been thorough for the past three months due to insufficient attention from leading cadres and a failure to fully mobilize the masses. In mid-December of last year, the leading organs of Changchun City inspected the leadership work of the past period and conducted a profound self-criticism. Currently, the campaign has been vigorously relaunched.

The reasons for the lack of depth and thoroughness in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in Changchun City over the past three months are mainly: 1. Leading cadres did not pay enough attention to the campaign and lacked understanding of its significance. They believed that this was just "an annual rectification movement, part of the rectification of the Party," and that "the problems in Changchun City are not as big as those in Shenyang," etc. As a result, some units began making arrangements in mid-September, requiring the campaign to end by the end of September; some units did not pay attention to the campaign, resulting in the phenomenon of "the higher authorities push, and the lower authorities move a little," and "closing down when the time is up"; some units' leading cadres had a "passing the test" mentality, and were eager to end the movement before it was thoroughly carried out; some units' leading cadres had a complacent attitude, believing that "although the movement is not deep, it is not bad in Changchun City." Many units did not form a mass-based confession and accusation campaign because the leadership did not pay enough attention. 2. Failure to recognize the importance of fully mobilizing the masses, universally adopting simple methods such as "taking turns to make self-criticisms," "making appraisals," and "writing materials." 3. There was serious bureaucracy in organizational leadership. Leading cadres of various units only made general calls, lacking inspection and specific guidance. Some organized inspection teams, but their role was limited due to dispersed strength. Some even handed over the leadership of the movement to general cadres. For example, the Municipal Construction Bureau handed over the movement to the head of the personnel section, and a certain public factory handed over the movement to a Youth League member. At the same time, problems were not dealt with in a timely manner during the movement, affecting the enthusiasm of the masses and fueling the arrogance of corrupt elements. 4. The production increase and conservation campaign in factories and enterprises was not combined with the fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, resulting in losses outweighing gains. For example, the publicly-owned sugar factory originally planned to increase production and save three and a half tons of grain, but wasted one ton of sugar and seventeen rolls of cellophane.

On December 12th of last year, the directors and section chiefs of the Municipal People's Government held a meeting. After studying the above-mentioned problems, they emphasized that all units, without exception, should resolutely implement the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. Those that had not done well must do it again. They must fully mobilize the masses, comprehensively explain policies, and promptly deal with exposed problems. Subsequently, the municipal leading organs convened a city-wide cadres' meeting, using the specific facts of three typical cases of corruption and degeneration to educate cadres on the important significance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle. After the meeting, the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Government immediately transferred capable cadres to form inspection teams to assist various organs in carrying out inspections; various units also held separate meetings to summarize past experiences, study future practices, and convene mass rallies to continue mobilization, with leading cadres taking the lead in making self-criticisms. In this way, the movement was vigorously relaunched. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 领导干部检讨了官僚主义的错误  长春市反贪污反浪费运动重新展开

    领导干部检讨了官僚主义的错误
    长春市反贪污反浪费运动重新展开
    长春市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，由于领导干部重视不够，没有充分发动群众，三个月来运动的发展很不彻底。去年十二月中旬，长春市领导机关检查了过去这一时期的领导工作，进行了深刻的自我检讨。目前，这一运动已大张旗鼓地开展起来。
    长春市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动在过去三个月中不深入、不彻底，主要表现在：一、领导干部对运动不够重视和对运动的意义认识不足。他们认为这只是“一年一次的整风运动，是整党的一部分”，“长春市的问题不如沈阳大”等等。因此，有些机关在九月中旬开始布置，要求在九月底就结束；有的单位不重视这个运动，因而产生“上面推一下，下面动一动”，“时间一到就收场”的现象；有的单位的领导干部存在着“过关思想”，运动未进行彻底，便急于结束；有的单位领导干部有着自满情绪，认为“运动虽然不深，但在长春市还算不坏”。很多单位由于领导方面不够重视，就根本没有形成群众性的坦白检举运动。二、不认识充分发动群众的重要性，普遍采取“轮流检讨”、“做鉴定”、“写材料”的简单方式。三、在组织领导上存在严重的官僚主义。各单位领导干部只作了一般号召，缺乏检查和具体指导，有的虽然组织了检查组，但由于力量分散，作用不大，有的甚至把运动交给一般干部领导。如市建设局把运动交给人事科长负责，某公营工厂把运动交给一个青年团员领导。同时在运动中未及时处理问题，影响群众积极性的发挥，助长了贪污分子的气焰。四、工厂企业部门的增产节约运动没有和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争结合起来，结果得不偿失。如公营制糖厂原来计划增产节约三吨半粮食，而浪费的竟有一吨糖和十七匹玻璃纸。
    去年十二月十二日市人民政府局、处长以上干部举行会议，在研究了上述问题以后，强调提出：各单位应无例外地把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动坚决贯彻下去，没搞好的必须重搞，要充分发动群众，全面说清政策，迅速处理已暴露的问题。接着，市领导机关又召开了全市干部大会，以三个较典型的贪污、蜕化分子的具体事实，教育干部认识反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的重要意义。会后，中共长春市委员会、市人民政府即抽调得力干部组成检查组，协助各机关进行检查；各单位也分头开会，总结过去经验，研究今后作法，并召开群众大会继续动员，领导干部带头作检讨。这样，这一运动才又大张旗鼓地重新开展起来。（新华社）
