Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 20th: Due to the American side's representatives continuing to insist on unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs, attempting to interfere in our right to handle airport equipment within Korea, the Third Agenda Sub-Committee of the Korean Armistice Talks made no progress on the 20th. The other side proposed an adjournment shortly after the meeting began, and the meeting lasted only seven minutes.

At the Fourth Agenda Sub-Committee meeting, our representatives refuted, point by point, the various absurd and unreasonable suggestions in the other side's proposal. The other side insisted on exchanging prisoners of war on a so-called "one-for-one" basis and demanded to trade civilians for prisoners of war, opposing the reasonable principle of unconditional release and repatriation of all prisoners of war. The other side insisted on using so-called "free choice" and "voluntary repatriation" as an excuse to attempt to detain our captured personnel and hand them over to the Li-Chiang bandit gangs. The other side repeatedly delayed providing basic materials about prisoners of war that should have been handed over long ago. After repeatedly failing to deliver, the other side brazenly claimed that these materials were not needed by our side. Our representatives pointed out that the other side's unreasonable suggestions and blackmailing attitude formed a major obstacle hindering the progress of the meeting, causing the sub-committee to make no progress after thirty-eight days. If the other side is still sincere in reaching an agreement, it must reconsider its position.

    朝鲜停战谈判两小组会议
    昨天仍然毫无进展
    【新华社开城二十日电】由于美方代表继续坚持干涉我方内政的无理要求，妄图干涉我方处理朝鲜境内机场设备的权利，朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会，二十日毫无进展。对方在会议开始后不久，即提出休会的建议，会议历时仅七分钟。
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表逐条驳斥对方提案中各项荒谬无理的建议。对方坚持在所谓“一对一”的基础上进行战俘的交换，并要求以平民与战俘进行交易，反对无条件释放与遣送全体战俘的合理原则。对方坚持以所谓“自由选择”与“自愿遣送”为藉口，企图扣留我方被俘人员送交李蒋匪帮。对方一再拖延提供早应交出的有关战俘的基本材料。在屡次失约未能交出之后，对方竟蛮横无理地声称，这些材料对于我方是并不需要的。我方代表指出：对方这种无理的建议和敲诈的态度形成了阻碍会议进展的重大障碍，使小组会进行了三十八天，仍然未能获得任何进展。对方如仍有诚意达成协议，就必须重新考虑其立场。
