    Demanding Swift Action Against Extravagance and Waste by the People's Bank of China Headquarters Inspection Team and the Henan Branch
    Editor's Note: On January 5th, this column published a letter from the Henan Daily General Editorial Office exposing the People's Bank of China Henan Branch's waste of huge sums of money to entertain the General Headquarters inspection team. Subsequently, we have received letters from readers in various locations criticizing the Henan Branch and the General Headquarters inspection team. We are now publishing these letters, hoping that relevant departments will promptly investigate and deal with this matter.
    Wasting Huge Sums on Entertainment and Accepting Entertainment Are Both Wrong
    Editor: Zhang Haotian, the Director of the Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China, squandered huge sums of money to entertain the People's Bank of China Headquarters inspection team, spending over 250 million yuan during a ten-day meeting. According to our understanding, in addition to lavish entertainment during the meeting, they also presented Nanyang jade seals, jade cups, and other items as "souvenirs," and issued fountain pens and cotton shoes to the personnel responsible for the entertainment. What is even more astonishing is that the Branch Director Zhang Haotian was not ashamed of the waste; in his concluding remarks, he even said: "Everyone reflected that the entertainment was quite good this time. But the only regret is that we didn't have a dance party." The General Headquarters inspection team not only did not criticize or stop this extravagant entertainment, but on the contrary, they gladly accepted it.
    I believe that the People's Bank of China Henan Branch's extravagance and waste, and the General Headquarters inspection team's bureaucratic style, are extremely serious. This incident has aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses. I suggest that the People's Bank of China General Headquarters promptly investigate and deal with this matter.        Zhang Tianzhen
    The Henan Branch's Extravagance and Waste Nourishes Tendencies Towards Corruption and Embezzlement Among Staff
    Editor: The People's Bank of China Henan Branch's squandering of state property and extravagance in entertaining the General Headquarters inspection team is intolerable. This matter is especially unforgivable because it happened after Chairman Mao issued the call for "Increase Production and Practice Economy!" We believe that the responsible comrades of the General Headquarters inspection team did not criticize or correct this serious extravagance, but instead ate and drank lavishly and accepted gifts before leaving. The responsibility they should bear should not be less than that of Zhang Haotian, the Director of the Henan Branch. Some members of the inspection team even reflected: "Before we came, we thought Kaifeng was a sandy city and that the entertainment would not be good, but actually it was quite good!" Some even shamelessly said: "No, it's much worse than the entertainment in Qingdao!" It turns out that they were entertained everywhere, not just in Kaifeng! This serious extravagance has had an extremely bad influence within the Henan Branch, nourishing tendencies towards corruption and embezzlement among some staff. For example, some people who were receptionists at the meeting no longer want to smoke ordinary cigarettes. They say that ordinary cigarettes are not as tasty as Pao Tai cigarettes. Some people ate well and had light work when they were receptionists, and later they were no longer satisfied with their work. Those who were not receptionists were dissatisfied with the leadership because of the "unequal distribution of joy and suffering" and often complained.
    We firmly demand that the General Headquarters inspection team thoroughly examine this matter, publish it publicly in the newspaper as soon as possible, and return all the received ill-gotten gifts to their original place. The responsible comrades of the General Headquarters should educate and appropriately punish these people according to their respective situations, and announce the results in the newspaper.

    Leading Cadres of the People's Bank of China General Headquarters Should Make a Profound Self-Criticism
    Editor: The letter published in the People's Daily on January 5th from the Henan Daily General Editorial Office exposing the People's Bank of China Henan Branch's waste of huge sums of money to entertain the General Headquarters inspection team pointed out that the People's Bank of China General Headquarters inspection team ate more than 2,600 jin of fruit alone during the ten-day meeting. On this issue, the Henan Branch should make a self-criticism, and the leading cadres of the People's Bank of China General Headquarters should bear the main responsibility. Because the People's Bank of China General Headquarters had serious phenomena of squandering state assets, such as inviting people to dinner and inviting people to watch operas, at several professional conferences held in 1951, the lower levels followed suit.
    The organization of this inspection team was also too large, with more than 200 people. In addition, a large number of personnel from local People's Banks in various regions participated in assisting the work, resulting in astonishing figures for travel expenses, food expenses, and other expenses. I believe that the leading cadres of the General Headquarters should make a profound self-criticism on this matter, and publish the figures of waste (including the wasteful expenditures of the inspection team itself and the entertainment expenses of various local banks) and the results of the handling in the newspaper to educate everyone.

### 要求迅速处理人民银行总行视察团和河南省分行的铺张浪费行为

    要求迅速处理人民银行总行视察团和河南省分行的铺张浪费行为
    编者按：一月五日，本栏发表了河南日报总编室揭发中国人民银行河南省分行浪费巨款招待总行视察团的来信后，又陆续收到各地读者来信，对河南省分行和总行视察团提出批评。现在把这些来信发表出来，希望有关部门对这一问题迅速检查处理。
    浪费巨款招待和接受招待都是错误的
    编辑同志：人民银行河南省分行行长张皓天为招待人民银行总行视察团，铺张浪费，在十天会议当中就花了两亿五千多万元。据我们了解，他们除在会议中大肆招待外，为留“纪念”，还赠送南阳玉图章、玉杯等物；并给负责招待的人员发自来水笔、棉鞋。更令人惊奇的是分行行长张皓天不只不以浪费为耻，还在总结工作中说：“这次大家反映招待的还不错。但美中不足的是没有搞个跳舞会。”对这种铺张浪费的招待，总行视察团不但没有批评和阻止，相反地，他们欣然接受了。
    我认为人民银行河南省分行的铺张浪费行为和总行视察团的官僚主义作风，是极端严重的。这一事件已经引起群众极大不满。我建议中国人民银行总行迅速调查处理这件事情。        张天震
    河南省分行铺张浪费的行为滋长了工作人员贪污腐化倾向
    编辑同志：中国人民银行河南省分行为招待总行视察团，挥霍国家财产，大肆铺张浪费的行为，是使人不能容忍的。这件事特别发生在毛主席提出“增产节约”号召以后，就更加不能原谅！我们认为，总行视察团的负责同志对这种严重的铺张浪费现象，不批评、不纠正，反在大吃大喝之后受礼而去，他们应当负的责任，丝毫不应少于河南省分行行长张皓天。视察团的部分团员还这样反映：“没来以前，认为开封是沙城，一定招待不好，其实还不错哩！”甚至还有人无耻地说：“不行，比在青岛招待的差多了！”原来他们到处受招待，还不只开封一地！这种严重的铺张浪费行为，在河南省分行内已引起极端恶劣的影响，滋长了某些工作人员贪污腐化的倾向。例如，有的人当过大会的招待员以后，便不愿再吸普通烟了。他们说普通烟没有炮台烟可口。有的人因在当招待员时吃的好，工作轻闲，后来对工作也不安心了。没有当过招待员的因为“苦乐不均”，对领导干部不满，常发牢骚。
    我们坚决要求总行视察团彻底检讨这一件事，迅速在报纸上公开发表，并把收受的赃礼悉数倒出，退还原处。总行负责同志要根据这些人的情况分别给以教育和应有的处分，并在报纸上公布。    贾乃贵  崔祖功  张绍勋  胡全福  王道振  唐明  李国定  马心合
    人民银行总行领导干部应作深刻的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报在一月五日刊登的河南日报总编室揭发人民银行河南省分行浪费巨款招待总行视察团的信件，指出人民银行总行视察团在十天的会议当中，只果品一项，就吃了二千六百多斤。在这个问题上，河南省分行应作检讨，人民银行总行的领导干部更应负主要责任。因为人民银行总行在一九五一年召开的几次专业会议上，都有请吃饭、请看戏等严重挥霍国家资财的现象，因此，下级也群起仿效。
    这次视察团的组织也过于庞大，有二百多人。此外，到各区还有地方人民银行的大批人员参加帮助工作，以至旅费、饮食等开支数字惊人。我认为总行领导干部对这件事应作深刻检讨，并把浪费数字（包括视察团本身开支浪费的部分和各地银行的招待费用）和处理结果在报纸上公布，以教育大家。
