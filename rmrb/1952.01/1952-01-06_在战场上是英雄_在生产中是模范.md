In the Fushun Coal Mine in Northeast China, there is a revolutionary disabled soldier named Wang Zhiliang. He was once a hero who killed enemies on the battlefield, and now he is a model for increasing production and practicing economy.

Wang Zhiliang was a coal miner for many years. In February 1947, he responded to the call of the Communist Party and joined the People's Liberation Army. In many battles to liberate Northeast China, Wang Zhiliang fought bravely and tenaciously. In the decisive Jinzhou Campaign, which was the last battle to liberate Northeast China, Wang Zhiliang was unfortunately seriously injured, and his thigh bone was broken by an American bullet. Wang Zhiliang originally wanted to return to the front line after recovering from his injuries, but his injured leg prevented him from doing so. Wang Zhiliang then thought of his coal mine, thinking: "If I can't fight, I will go into production. I will contribute as much as I can, because I am a Communist Party member!" In June 1949, Wang Zhiliang achieved his wish and returned to the West Open-pit Mine of Fushun Coal Mine to work as an electric pick driver. Wang Zhiliang had shed blood for the liberation of his coal mine, and now he returned to his production post, eager to do two days' work in one day. At that time, the efficiency of the electric picks was very low, and only sixty or seventy cars of coal were loaded every eight-hour shift. Wang Zhiliang knew that everyone had not exerted their full potential. He carried out propaganda and mobilization, improved the organization of labor, and launched a production competition under his leadership. After twenty days of hard work, the efficiency of loading cars was increased by more than three times. Operating an electric pick is strenuous labor, which often caused his injured leg to ache, but Wang Zhiliang conquered the physical pain with the tenacious will of a Communist Party member.

In September 1949, Wang Zhiliang was transferred to the Fushun City Mining Cadre School to study. After returning to the mine, he served as the deputy leader of the coal mining team and secretary of the Party branch. At this time, workers throughout Northeast China launched a vigorous movement to create new records. Wang Zhiliang immediately mobilized through the Party and the trade union, united the activists, and cultivated the Yao Xixing typical group, increasing the efficiency of loading cars from one and a half cars per person in eight hours to three and a half cars (at this time, the white mud and gangue peeled off the coal seam were loaded, which was not as easy as loading coal). Under Wang Zhiliang's constant help and cultivation, the Yao Xixing group won a collective award for model groups in August 1950.

After studying, Wang Zhiliang understood the importance of reducing costs even more. He not only tried to improve work efficiency but also paid attention to saving. Wang Zhiliang saw that the method of oiling the electric picks was to inject all the oil needed for the day at once, and a lot of it flowed out and was wasted. He proposed changing the oiling method, injecting it more times a day and injecting less each time; he also used something to catch the spilled oil and use it to lubricate the gear wheels. As a result of Wang Zhiliang's change in the oiling method, the original six electric picks used 50 kilograms of crude oil and 50 kilograms of black glycerin each week, which was later reduced to 25 kilograms of crude oil and 37 kilograms of black glycerin.

Under Wang Zhiliang's leadership, accidents were also greatly reduced because the coal mining team implemented a strict responsibility system and shift handover system.

Due to Wang Zhiliang's excellent performance in production, he was selected as a special-class labor model for disabled soldiers in Northeast China.

### 在战场上是英雄  在生产中是模范

    在战场上是英雄  在生产中是模范
    在东北抚顺煤矿有一个革命残废军人王志良，他在战场上曾是一个杀敌的英雄，在生产中又是一个增产节约的模范。
    王志良原是多年的煤矿工人，一九四七年二月他响应共产党的号召，参加了人民解放军。在解放东北的多次战役中，王志良英勇顽强作战，在解放东北最后一次有决定性的锦州战役中，王志良不幸受了重伤，他的大腿骨被美国子弹打坏了。王志良原想伤愈后重返前线，但是他的受伤的腿使他不能这样作。王志良又想到自己的煤矿，他想着：“不能打仗就去生产，我有一分力量就要出一分力量，因为我是共产党员！”一九四九年六月，王志良达到了自己的愿望，又回到抚顺煤矿西露天矿去当电镐司机。王志良曾为解放自己的煤矿流了血，现在又回到自己的生产岗位上，恨不得一天干出两天的活。当时电镐的效率很低，每班八小时才装六、七十车煤。王志良知道大家远没有发挥自己的力量。他就一面宣传动员，一面改善劳动组织，并在他的带动下展开了生产竞赛。经过二十天的努力，装车的效率提高了三倍多。开电镐是很紧张的劳动，这使他残伤的腿常常发痛，但是王志良以一个共产党员的顽强的意志征服了肉体的痛苦。
    一九四九年九月，王志良被调到抚顺市矿业干部学校学习。回矿后担任采煤班副班长兼党支部书记。这时，全东北的工人开展了轰轰烈烈的创造新纪录运动。王志良即通过党和工会组织进行动员，团结积极分子，并培养了姚锡兴典型小组，使装车效率由每人在八小时内装一车半提高到三车半（这时是装煤层上剥下的白泥和?子，不如装煤好装）。在王志良不断帮助和培养下，姚锡兴小组并在一九五○年八月获得模范组集体奖励。
    王志良经过学习，更加懂得了降低成本的重要，他不但想办法提高工作效率，同时也注意到节约。王志良见电镐注油的方法，是把一天需要的油一次注进去，有很多都流出来糟蹋了。他提出改变注油的办法，每天多注几次，每次少注一些；他并用东西把流出来的油接住，用这油去抹牙轮。王志良改变注油方法的结果，原来六个电镐一星期用毛得油和黑甘油各五十公斤，后来减少到用毛得油二十五公斤，黑甘油三十七公斤。
    在王志良的领导下，由于采煤班实行了严格的责任制和交接班制，事故也大大减少了。
    由于王志良在生产中的优良成绩，他曾被评选为东北荣军特等劳动模范。
