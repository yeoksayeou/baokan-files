Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: The Second Representative Conference of Chongqing's industrial and commercial circles telegraphed Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), expressing their determination to eliminate illegal activities such as bribery, fraud, profiteering, and theft. The telegram reads as follows:

To Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai of the National Committee of the CPPCC:

We, the industrial and commercial circles of Chongqing, have read your report at the 34th session of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, calling on people in industrial and commercial circles to actively participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy and the ideological remolding movement, as well as the notice issued by the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee on the 5th. We express our warm response and firm support. In order to clear the obstacles to increasing production and practicing economy, and in conjunction with ideological remolding, we convened a confession and denunciation meeting against corruption and bribery in Chongqing's industrial and commercial circles on the 4th of this month, together with the China Democratic National Construction Association. More than 1,000 representatives from various industries attended the meeting, with more than 20 people making confessions on the spot and more than 100 people submitting confession letters and denunciation letters. Following the meeting, a confession and denunciation movement was launched in various industries. In the four days up to the 8th of this month, 178 people confessed to offering bribes and 448 cases of corruption and bribery were denounced, involving more than 600 people. This movement is now continuing to expand.

On the 7th of this month, we also convened the Second Representative Conference of Chongqing's industrial and commercial circles. In addition to formally establishing the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce and establishing a branch of the Industrial and Commercial Circles' Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy, we also resolved to vigorously launch a struggle against corruption and bribery and launch an ideological remolding movement as our general guiding principle for future actions. We, the industrial and commercial circles of Chongqing, have decided to sincerely accept your instructions, strictly examine and correct our erroneous thoughts and shortcomings, resolutely eliminate illegal activities such as bribery, fraud, profiteering, and theft, strive to establish a new social atmosphere, and work together with people from all walks of life across the country to fight for the implementation of anti-corruption, anti-waste, anti-bureaucracy, and ideological remolding. We extend our warmest regards to you.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 14th: The Chongqing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association has mobilized its members to confess and denounce corrupt and bribery practices, promoting the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in industrial and commercial circles.

When the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement was launched in Chongqing's industrial and commercial circles at the end of last year, many industrialists and businessmen did not have a sufficient understanding of the movement. Some industries believed that since they did not participate in processing orders and had little contact with state-owned enterprises, there was no corruption to speak of; others believed that gift-giving and socializing were customary business practices in the past and not bribery. They mostly believed that opposing corruption and waste was a matter for government agencies and that industrial and commercial circles did not need to participate. Even after the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement was launched in various agencies, industrialists and businessmen still had ideological concerns such as fearing loss of face after confession and fearing that denouncing others would affect business dealings.

In response to these situations in industrial and commercial circles, the Chongqing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association successively convened forums for members in industrial and commercial circles and members working in trade associations and the preparatory committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, mobilizing members to take the lead in confessing and denouncing corrupt and bribery practices. At these forums, 31 members confessed to erroneous acts of corruption and bribery. Member Hu Zhengzhong confessed that he had accepted bribes of 1.6 million yuan from merchants when promoting Victory Inflation-Adjusted Public Bonds in the cloth and silk industry; member Ge Yanzuo (Director of the Paint Industry Association) confessed that he had offered bribes of more than 5 million yuan. In addition to confessing and denouncing within the branch, they also took the lead in confessing and denouncing at mobilization meetings in industrial and commercial circles. In this way, the movement gradually unfolded. As of now, more than 500 cases of corruption and bribery have been denounced and confessed to in Chongqing's industrial and commercial circles.

After receiving the notice from the General Association on actively promoting the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the Chongqing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association immediately organized study and discussion among its members and sent more than 20 propagandists to various industries to carry out publicity; at the same time, it jointly organized a working group with the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce to promote the movement in 11 key industries.

    重庆工商界电政协全国委员会周恩来副主席
    表示决心肃清行贿欺诈暴利等违法行为
    民主建国会重庆分会推动工商界反贪污反行贿运动
    【新华社十四日讯】重庆市工商界第二次代表会议致电人民政协全国委员会周恩来副主席，表示决心肃清行贿、欺诈、暴利和偷窃等违法行为。电文如下：
    人民政协全国委员会周恩来副主席：
    我们重庆市工商界读了你在第三十四次政协常委会上号召工商界人士积极参加反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争和思想改造运动的报告及政协全国委员会常委会五日的通知，我们表示热烈响应和坚决拥护。我们为了扫清增产节约的障碍，结合进行思想改造，曾于本月四日会同民建会召开重庆市工商界反贪污、反行贿的坦白检举大会，参加大会的各行业代表一千余人，当场坦白者二十余人，递交坦白书和检举书者一百余人。会后，紧接着展开各行业的坦白检举运动，截至本月八日为止的四天内，已有坦白行贿者一七八人，检举贪污行贿者四四八件，计检举六百余人。这一运动现在正继续扩大展开。
    本月七日我们又召开了重庆市工商界第二次代表会议，除正式成立重庆市工商业联合会、设立工商界增产节约运动委员会分会外，同时决议以大张旗鼓展开反贪污、反行贿的斗争及展开思想改造运动，为我们今后的行动总方针。我们重庆市工商界决定诚恳接受你的指示，严格检查和改正我们错误的思想和缺点，坚决肃清行贿、欺诈、暴利、偷窃等违法行为，努力树立新的社会风气，与全国各界人民一道，为贯彻反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义及思想改造而斗争。谨向你致热烈的敬礼。
    【新华社重庆十四日电】民主建国会重庆分会发动会员坦白和检举贪污行贿行为，推动了工商界的反贪污反行贿运动。
    去年年底重庆市工商界展开反贪污、反行贿运动时，许多工商业者对运动的认识还很不够。有的行业认为不参加加工定货，和国营企业来往不多，没有什么贪污可言；有的认为送礼和应酬是过去经营商业的习惯，不是行贿。他们大都以为反对贪污浪费是政府机关的事，工商界不必参加。直到各机关开展反贪污受贿运动以后，工商业者仍然有着怕坦白后丧失面子、检举别人会影响交易来往等思想顾虑。
    针对工商界的这些情况，民主建国会重庆分会便先后召集了工商界会员、在同业公会和工商业联合会筹委会工作的会员举行座谈会，发动会员带头坦白和检举贪污行贿的行为。在这些座谈会上，有三十一个会员坦白了贪污行贿的错误行为。会员胡正中坦白出在布绸业推销胜利折实公债时，曾接受行商贿赂一百六十万元；会员革彦佐（油漆业公会主任委员）坦白出曾行贿五百多万元。他们除在分会内部进行坦白和检举外，并在工商界的动员会议上带头坦白、检举。这样，就使运动逐步开展起来。截至目前止，重庆工商界检举和坦白出来的贪污行贿案件已有五百多件。
    民主建国会重庆分会在接到总会关于积极推进反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的通知后，立即在会员中组织学习讨论，并派出二十多个宣传员到各行业中进行宣传；同时和市工商业联合会筹委会共同组织工作组到十一个重点行业中去推动运动。
