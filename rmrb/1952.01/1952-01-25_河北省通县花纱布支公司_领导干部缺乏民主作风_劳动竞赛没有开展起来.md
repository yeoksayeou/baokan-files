    Hebei Province Tongxian County Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Branch Company:
    Leading Cadres Lack Democratic Style; Labor Competition Has Not Been Launched
    Due to the lack of a clear understanding of the need to rely on the working class, and the suppression of democracy, the administrative leading cadres of the Tongxian County Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Branch Company in Hebei Province have failed to launch the patriotic labor competition centered on reducing commodity circulation costs.
    After receiving the instructions from the Ministry of Trade of the Central Government in early October last year to launch a patriotic labor competition, the leading cadres of the Tongxian County Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Branch Company neither studied, nor planned, nor relied on the masses. They only conveyed the instructions at meetings of a few section and unit chiefs twice. On December 11th, when the inspection team (composed of the Tongxian County Industry and Commerce Section, the Financial and Economic Committee, various professional companies, and the town store trade union) came to the company to inspect the progress of the movement, the responsible cadres in the company not only did not examine their mistakes but also adopted an attitude of resisting inspection and suppressing democracy. On the evening of the 10th, they convened a general meeting of all employees and arranged coping strategies. The administrative secretary read the plan to everyone and said, "The inspection team will be here tomorrow, so everyone should pay attention. It won't do if we don't even know what the labor competition is all about when people ask us." To the comrades of the inspection team, they proposed: "When you inquire about the situation from anyone, be sure to write down the names of those who report the situation, so we can verify it." They also said, "The competition plan was formulated after discussion by all employees," and "Everyone has made a guarantee plan." In reality, two-thirds of the employees did not know about the labor competition at all before the inspection team arrived (before the 10th), and even the administrative section and unit chiefs had not made any plans. However, most employees did not dare to report the truth to the inspection team because they would be attacked if they spoke. For example, when a comrade from the retail department told the inspection team, "We don't know what reducing commodity circulation costs is all about," the administrative leading cadres blamed that comrade, saying, "You really don't know? We often talk about this even when we are just chatting." This scared other comrades from speaking further. Two comrades from the retail department were talking to the comrades of the inspection team, and when they saw the administrative person in charge coming, they were so afraid that they left on some pretext. I think the relevant leaders should resolutely correct this bad phenomenon.

### 河北省通县花纱布支公司  领导干部缺乏民主作风  劳动竞赛没有开展起来

    河北省通县花纱布支公司
    领导干部缺乏民主作风
    劳动竞赛没有开展起来
    河北省通县花纱布支公司的行政领导干部，因缺乏明确的依靠工人阶级的思想，并压制民主的结果，这个公司的以减低商品流转费用为中心的爱国主义劳动竞赛，没能开展起来。
    通县花纱布支公司领导干部，在去年十月初接到中央贸易部发出的开展爱国主义劳动竞赛的指示后，既不研究，也不计划，也不依靠群众，只在几个科、股长的会议上传达了两次。十二月十一日检查小组（由通县工商科、财政经济委员会、各专业公司和镇店员工会组成）到公司检查运动开展情况时，公司内几个负责干部不但不检讨错误，还采取了抵抗检查和压制民主的态度。十日晚上，他们召集了一个全体职工大会，布置应付办法。行政秘书把计划向大家宣读了一遍，说：“明天检查组要来检查，大家可要注意点，人家来问我们，我们连劳动竞赛是怎么回事都不知道，那可不成。”对检查组的同志则提出：“你们向谁了解情况，一定要把反映情况的人的名字记下来，我们要对证情况。”并说：“竞赛计划是全体职工讨论后订立的”“每个人都订了保证计划”实际上有三分之二的职工，在检查组下来前（十日以前），根本不知道劳动竞赛这回事，连行政科股长都没订计划。但一般职工都不敢向检查组反映真实情况，因为一说话，就会受到打击。如门市部一位同志对检查组说：“我们不知道减低商品流转费用是怎么一回事”，行政领导干部知道后，就责备那个同志说：“你真不知道吗？咱们说闲话都常说这回事。”吓得其他同志都不敢再说话。门市部的两位同志和检查组的同志谈话，见行政负责人来了，都害怕得借故走了。我觉得有关领导方面应该坚决纠正这种恶劣现象。
