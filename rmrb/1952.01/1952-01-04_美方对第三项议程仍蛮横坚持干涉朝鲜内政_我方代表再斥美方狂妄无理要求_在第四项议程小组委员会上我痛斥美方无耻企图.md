Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 3rd: On January 3rd, at the subcommittee meeting for the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations, the opposing side still stubbornly insisted on unreasonable demands to restrict facilities within North Korea in order to interfere in our internal affairs. The opposing side also absurdly listed that the reasons it opposed the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea in the past, opposed the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, and insisted on unlimited rotation and replenishment during the armistice were all to ensure the stability of the armistice. The opposing side even threatened to disrupt the armistice negotiations, coercing our side to accept its unreasonable demands. Our representative vehemently criticized the opposing side's absurd argument and, based on the undeniable facts since the negotiations began, proved that our consistent position is to completely and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. It is the opposing side that is attempting to obtain what it could not obtain on the battlefield through the armistice negotiations. At the beginning of the negotiations, the opposing side proposed an arrogant military demarcation line plan that would deeply penetrate our positions. After our firm opposition, the opposing side's demands were not met, and it systematically suspended the negotiations until the opposing side had to return to the negotiating table after the painful lessons of the complete bankruptcy of two military adventures, the so-called summer offensive and autumn offensive. In order to ensure the stability of the armistice and dispel the opposing side's fear of our military strength, our side has proposed that neither side import any military forces or weapons and ammunition from outside Korea during the armistice and explicitly stipulated that no combat aircraft be imported. As long as both sides earnestly abide by this guarantee, the military armistice can be stabilized. However, now the opposing side is still attempting to interfere in our internal affairs under various pretexts. Our side absolutely cannot tolerate such unreasonable demands. Our representative pointed out: Our side will never abandon any effort to achieve a fair and reasonable armistice and peace; but in order to defend peace and sacred national sovereignty, we are determined to fight until the armistice and peace are realized.

At the subcommittee meeting for the fourth agenda item, our representative made a long speech, vehemently condemning the so-called one-for-one exchange of prisoners of war proposal put forward by the opposing side on January 2nd. Our representative pointed out: In the list of prisoners of war submitted by the opposing side on December 18th of last year, it arbitrarily deducted more than 44,000 of our captured personnel. The opposing side also publicly stated that it would detain more than 16,000 of our captured personnel from the submitted list. And the opposing side's proposal on January 2nd even attempted to detain more than 160,000 of our captured personnel under the guise of "one-for-one exchange" and "voluntary repatriation." This barbaric and shameless attempt will be rejected by the people of the world.

    美方对第三项议程仍蛮横坚持干涉朝鲜内政
    我方代表再斥美方狂妄无理要求
    在第四项议程小组委员会上我痛斥美方无耻企图
    【新华社开城三日电】一月三日，在朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方仍然蛮横地坚持限制朝鲜境内设备以干涉我方内政的无理要求。对方并荒谬地列举其过去之所以反对一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，反对以三八线为军事分界线，以及坚持在停战期间进行无限制的轮换与补充，都是为了保证停战的稳定。对方更以破坏停战谈判为威胁，要挟我方接受其无理的要求。我方代表痛斥对方这种荒谬的论点，并以谈判以来的铁的事实为根据，证明我方一贯的立场是彻底和平解决朝鲜问题。而企图在停战谈判取得其在战场所不能取得的东西的，正是对方。谈判一开始，对方就提出深入我方阵地的狂妄的军事分界线方案。在我方的坚决反对之下，对方的要求不遂，就有计划地中止了谈判，一直到对方在两次军事冒险所谓夏季攻势与秋季攻势的全部破产的惨痛经验教训下，才不得不回到了谈判的会议桌上来。为了保证停战的稳定，并解除对方对于我方军事力量的畏惧，我方已建议在停战期间双方不从朝鲜境外输入任何军事力量与武器弹药，并明确规定不得输入作战飞机。只要双方切实遵守此项保证，军事停战就能稳定下来。但现在对方却仍然假借各种藉口，妄图干涉我方内政。我方绝对不能容许这种无理的要求。我方代表指出：我方决不放弃任何获致公平合理的停战与和平的努力；但为了捍卫和平与神圣的国家主权，决心斗争到停战与和平实现时为止。
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表曾作长篇发言，痛斥对方一月二日提出的所谓一对一交换战俘的提案。我方代表指出：对方在去年十二月十八日交来的战俘名单中，恣意扣除了四万四千余名我方被俘人员。对方又公开声称，将扣留交来名单中的一万六千余名我方被俘人员。而对方一月二日的提案竟更企图假借“一对一交换”与“自愿遣送”之名，扣留我方十六万余名被俘人员。这种野蛮无耻的企图将为全世界人民所唾弃。
