Reaction to People's Daily Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions

    Liaoxi Provincial People's Government Local Enterprise Management Office
    Inspection Report on Waste of Timber at Lihua Lumber Mill
    Comrade Editor: The criticism made by Comrade Su Ren in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on November 20, 1951, regarding the waste occurring during timber processing at the state-owned Lihua Lumber Mill in Liaoxi Province, is correct. We are now reporting the results of our investigation at the Lihua Lumber Mill as follows: 1. The fact of "using long timber for short purposes" is completely consistent with Comrade Su Ren's criticism. This is indeed a violation of the State Council's "Instructions on Conserving Timber." Although this was self-supplied processing by a certain unit of the Northeast Military Region and specifications had been designated, the Lihua Lumber Mill's failure to actively suggest saving materials to the unit is also a manifestation of irresponsibility towards national property. 2. "Low output rate" is indeed a problem existing at the Lihua Lumber Mill. This is mainly because the factory has shortcomings in its operating methods, such as rough saw cuts and inaccurate calculations. Therefore, the factory has never had a quota standard for output rate. Each time it accepts a processing task, the output rate is only estimated based on the quality of the timber being processed and past processing experience. This is unscientific. We have advised them to improve.

    对利华制材厂浪费木材的检查报告
    编辑同志：一九五一年十一月二十日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了苏仁同志对辽西省营利华制材厂在木材加工中发生浪费的批评，这是正确的。现在把我们派人到利华制材厂检查的结果，报告如下：一、“长材短用”的事实和苏仁同志的批评完全相符。这确是违反了政务院“关于节约木材的指示”。虽然这是东北军区某部的自料加工并已指定规格，但利华制材厂没有积极向某部建议节省用料，也是对国家资财不负责任的表现。二、“出材率低”确是利华制材厂存在着的问题。主要是这个厂在操作方法上有缺点，如锯口粗，计算不周密等。因此，这厂出材率一直没有定额标准，每次接受加工任务，出材率只是根据加工木材质量和过去加工经验作出估计。这是不科学的。我们已建议他们改进。
