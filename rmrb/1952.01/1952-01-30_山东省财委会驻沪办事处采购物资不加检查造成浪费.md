    Shandong Provincial Finance Committee's Shanghai Office Wastes Resources by Failing to Inspect Purchased Goods

    The business section of the Shandong Provincial Finance Committee's Shanghai Office frequently returns goods due to non-compliance with specifications, shortages in quantity, rust, and damage. Leading cadres have adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards these issues. They do not inspect the purchased goods, but simply pay and dispatch them based on the joint transportation company's consignment note and the merchant's guarantee. In October of last year, more than 8,000 feet of 2-inch black iron pipes (worth over 200 million yuan) purchased for the Qingdao Textile Administration Bureau and the Jinan Renfeng Yarn Factory were dispatched to Jinan and Qingdao without detailed inspection, resulting in the delivery of cracked pipes. Consequently, the recipients returned the entire batch. This not only froze capital and caused waste, but also delayed the factories' production. The Shandong Provincial Finance Committee's Shanghai Office should investigate these matters.

### 山东省财委会驻沪办事处采购物资不加检查造成浪费

    山东省财委会驻沪办事处采购物资不加检查造成浪费
    山东省财经委员会驻沪办事处的业务科，在采购货物时，经常因为不合规格、数量短少、生锈、破损等原因又把货退了。领导干部对这些事情采取了官僚主义的态度。他们不检验采购来的物资，只凭联运公司的托运单和商人的保证书就付款发货。去年十月份给青岛纺织管理局和济南仁丰纱厂买的八千多呎二吋黑铁管子（价值两亿多元），因当时没有详细检验，把裂缝的管子也发到济南和青岛，以致收货者又把这批东西退回来。这样不但积压了资金，造成浪费，而且还耽误了工厂的生产。山东省财委会驻沪办事处应检查这些事。
