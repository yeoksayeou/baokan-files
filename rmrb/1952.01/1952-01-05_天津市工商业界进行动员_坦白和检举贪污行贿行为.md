Xinhua News Agency report: The industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin have launched a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The Tianjin Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee's Federation of Industry and Commerce branch has decided that the specific tasks in this movement are: (1) to inspect fraudulent behavior against the government in undertaking processing and ordering; (2) to inspect the bribery behavior of various industrial and commercial households towards cadres; (3) to expose cadres' acts of corruption, extortion, deception, and blackmail. Among these, the fight against bribery is the central focus.

The Tianjin timber industry and the new pharmaceutical industry have each held member meetings to mobilize and call on all households to confess and expose. At the member meeting held by the timber industry, Wang Shixun, a member of the industry association and manager of the private Yuanxing Heji Timber Firm, and Liu Yunshan, manager of Yongxin Tai Timber Factory, confessed their bribery behavior. Wang Shixun said: In 1949, when selling birch and persimmon wood to the state-owned China Textile Construction Company, he bribed engineer Wang Caichen with three taels of gold and a Parker pen for fear of failing inspection; he bribed inspector Cai Tiantian with one tael of gold and more than two million yuan in Renminbi, and gave gifts many times. In September of the year before last, in order to continue to win over Wang Caichen for illegal activities, he bribed him with another 15 million yuan. In addition, when selling goods to the state-owned Weixin Chemical Factory (now known as Tianjin Dyestuff Factory), he bribed the factory's purchasing staff with a 2% commission. Liu Yunshan confessed that in November of last year, he used the method of falsely reporting sizes to induce a purchasing staff member of a certain unit to embezzle four times. At the general membership meeting held by the new pharmaceutical industry, Cui Shukun, chairman of the industry association, read out the revised patriotic pact. The industry added new content against bribery in this patriotic pact.

In order to further expand this movement, the Tianjin Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee's Federation of Industry and Commerce branch is actively preparing to convene a mobilization meeting for the city's industrial and commercial circles.
