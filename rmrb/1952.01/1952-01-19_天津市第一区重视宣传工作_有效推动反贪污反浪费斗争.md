Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th -- Tianjin's First District attached importance to propaganda work in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, effectively promoting the development of the movement. As of the 11th, citizens of the district had reported more than 6,000 cases of corruption and bribery.

    The First District is an area in Tianjin where stores are concentrated, and corruption and bribery incidents are more numerous. At the beginning of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, many citizens did not fully understand the political significance of this movement. Some believed it was irrelevant to them, while others were afraid of offending people by reporting them. In response to the above situation, the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the branch of the Economy Practice Inspection Committee conducted extensive propaganda. First, reporters from the entire district gave reports to cadres, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists among the citizens. After the meetings, these cadres, Party members, League members, and activists then conducted propaganda among the residents. Within half a month, approximately 70% of the residents in the district received propaganda and education, basically achieving household awareness.

    Reporters and propagandists determined different propaganda focuses based on the ideological situation of the residents at each stage. In the initial stage, residents did not clearly understand the significance of the movement and had many concerns. Reporters and propagandists focused on publicizing the great significance of the movement and explaining policies to eliminate the concerns of residents. Later, reporters and propagandists closely cooperated. Propagandists actively collected information on the ideological situation of residents to provide to reporters before they gave reports. After the reporters reported, the propagandists mobilized residents to conduct discussions. This made the propaganda content more closely integrated with the ideological situation of the residents, yielding great results.

    As the propaganda and education work gradually became more widespread and in-depth, many citizens changed their attitude of indifference towards the movement. After propagandist Wei Jianying gave a mobilization report at a meeting of more than 600 shop employees, the employees immediately reported more than 500 cases of corruption and bribery. In seven days, ordinary citizens and housewives throughout the district submitted 751 cases that should be reported.

    天津市第一区重视宣传工作
    有效推动反贪污反浪费斗争
    【新华社天津十七日电】天津市第一区在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中重视宣传工作，有效地推动了运动的开展。截至十一日为止，该区市民已检举贪污、行贿事件六千多起。
    第一区是天津市商店集中的一个区，贪污、行贿事件较多。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，不少市民对这一运动的政治意义认识不足，有些人认为与自己无关，有些人怕检举了得罪人。针对上述情况，中共区委员会和节约检查委员会区分会进行了大张旗鼓的宣传。首先由全区报告员分别在干部、共产党员、青年团员以及市民中的积极分子中作报告。会后，这些干部、党员、团员和积极分子再分别向居民群众进行宣传。半个月内全区受到宣传教育的居民约占全区人口的百分之七十以上，基本上做到了家喻户晓。
    报告员和宣传员根据每个时期居民群众的思想情况来确定不同的宣传重点。初期居民群众对运动的意义认识不清，顾虑较多。报告员和宣传员便着重宣传运动的重大意义，解释政策，以消除居民群众的顾虑。以后报告员和宣传员密切配合，报告员作报告前，宣传员主动搜集居民群众思想情况供给报告员；在报告员报告后，宣传员又发动居民群众进行讨论。这样便使宣传内容更能密切结合居民群众思想情况，收效很大。
    随着宣传教育工作的逐步普遍和深入，许多市民转变了对运动漠不关心的态度。宣传员魏建英在六百多人的店员大会上作动员报告后，店员们当场便检举了贪污、行贿事件五百多起。全区一般市民和家庭妇女在七天中就提出了七百五十一起应该检举的事件。
