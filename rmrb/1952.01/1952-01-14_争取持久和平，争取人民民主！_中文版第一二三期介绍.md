    Introduction to Issues 123 of the Chinese Edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!"
    The Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Issue 123, has been published.
    This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Raising Revolutionary Vigilance is One of the Most Important Tasks of Communist and Workers' Parties," stating: Communist and Workers' Parties represent the future of the people of their respective countries. In people's democratic countries, they are leading the working people along the path of building socialism. In capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries, they are leading the working people along the path of struggling for their own interests. The editorial points out: However, the dying capitalist world will not abdicate automatically without fierce struggle. It first opposes the Communist Party, using various means to undermine the Communist Party's influence among the working people and weaken their unity and combat effectiveness; and one of the most basic methods is to plant spies and secret agents within the Party. However, these conspiracies of US-British imperialism have been exposed and defeated. The recent exposure by the Czechoslovak Communist Party of the despicable and filthy activities of former General Secretary Slánský within the Party is another serious blow to the conspiracies of US-British imperialism. The editorial emphasizes: The so-called "Mutual Security Act" recently signed by US President Truman stipulates the organization of espionage and sabotage activities in the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. This requires Communist and Workers' Parties to constantly strengthen and increase vigilance. The primary condition for raising and strengthening revolutionary vigilance is to strengthen ideological and political education and Marxist-Leninist training of cadres, so that every Communist Party member has the ability to identify any disguised enemy. Secondly, it is necessary to organize the work within the Party well, absorb Party members to actively participate in the work to complete the tasks, and vigorously carry out criticism and self-criticism without regard to personal feelings. Finally, it is necessary to maintain an inseparable connection with the masses of the people and educate the people to be particularly vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies. The editorial concludes: By tirelessly raising revolutionary vigilance and resolutely struggling against carelessness, complacency, and political shortsightedness, Communist and Workers' Parties will further consolidate their ranks and will be able to thwart all the enemy's conspiracies.
    This issue publishes an article by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party, "The French Communist Party Fights for the Interests of the Peasants." Duclos points out: After the end of the Second World War, France became an occupied country again. The new occupiers, the Americans, are driving peasants from their land all over France in order to build warehouses and armories, or to seize France's wealth. The French government's policy of war, under American orders, has increased the budget deficit, which is bound to impose new taxes on the peasants. On the other hand, the price difference between industrial and agricultural products is widening. The proportion of agricultural income in national income is declining, and exports of agricultural products in 1951 were lower than in 1950. This has caused economic difficulties for small landowners and medium landowners, and French agriculture has declined. Duclos continues: The French Communist Party insists on the principle of "land to the tiller." The Party's program specifically stipulates: (1) A policy of developing the economy: establishing normal trade relations with all countries on an equal footing; increasing the export of industrial and agricultural products; restoring the balance between the prices of agricultural and industrial products; restricting land rents.
    (2) A policy of balancing the budget and democratic taxation: not increasing military spending, reducing current military appropriations; opposing proposals to increase new taxes and levies; levying excess profit taxes on capitalists. (3) A policy of social justice: increasing pensions and poverty allowances; allowing working peasants to enjoy the same rights as industrial workers, etc. Duclos emphasizes: The French Communist Party is a party that unites all good people. Communist Party members among the peasants must unite the peasants widely, regardless of party affiliation or religious belief; participate in district farmers' associations and landowners' associations, and carry out work and struggle there to win the victory of policies that defend the peasants. At the same time, the peasants are the natural allies of the workers, and they will achieve victory if they unite.
    This issue publishes an article by Chivu Stoica, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, "The Policy of the Communist and Workers' Parties is the Most Important Foundation of the People's Democratic System." The author says: The Communist and Workers' Parties, which lead the people's revolutionary struggle, are guided by the science of Marxism-Leninism. This powerful weapon enables the Communist Party to correctly define its course of action at every stage of historical development, to foresee the course of events, and to determine strategy and tactics on this basis. The author points out: During the Second World War, the Soviet army defeated Hitler's Germany, and the people's democratic countries of Southeast Europe were born. In the first stage of its development, the people's democratic system was essentially a democratic dictatorship of workers and peasants led by the working class. In this stage, the Communist and Workers' Parties implemented profound democratic reforms. As a result, the Communist Party created the necessary conditions for the transition to the second stage of people's democracy – the dictatorship of the proletariat. At this time, the reactionary bourgeois and landlord parties, with the aid of US-British imperialism, attempted to prevent the realization of revolutionary changes in the people's democratic countries. However, the working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, smashed the counter-revolutionary conspiracies. The author continues: The working people of the people's democratic countries are now embarking on laying the economic foundations of socialism, and are developing heavy industry for this purpose. The Communist and Workers' Parties have formulated a policy that ensures that the national plan specifies concrete tasks not only for the development of industry, but also for the development of agriculture and culture. This policy is the most important foundation of the people's democratic system. Now, new industrial sectors have been established in all people's democratic countries, and enormous changes are also taking place in agriculture, and the material and cultural living standards of the working people are rising. The masses are increasingly realizing the correctness of the policies of the Communist and Workers' Parties.
    This issue also publishes the report by Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, at the Party Central Committee plenary session last December: "On Certain Issues in the Party Life of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia," discussing Slánský's conspiracy to betray the Party and the country. This issue also publishes an article by Pietro Secchia, member of the Political Bureau of the Italian Communist Party, "The Italian Working People Unite to Overcome the Flood and the Conspiracies of the Reactionaries," discussing the recent serious floods in northern Italy.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二三期介绍
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二三期已经出版。
    本期发表题为“提高革命警惕性是共产党和工人党的最重要的任务之一”的社论说：共产党和工人党代表着本国人民的未来。在人民民主国家里，它们正在领导劳动人民沿着建设社会主义的道路前进。在资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国里，它们正在领导劳动人民沿着为争取自己的利益而斗争的道路前进。社论指出：但是，垂死的资本主义世界是不会不经过激烈的斗争就自动退位的。它首先反对共产党，用种种手段来破坏共产党在劳动人民当中的影响，削弱它们的团结和战斗力；而最基本的方法之一就是在党内安插间谍和特务。但是，美英帝国主义这些阴谋都被揭发和击败了。最近捷克斯洛伐克共产党揭发了前任总书记斯兰斯基在党内进行的卑鄙污浊的活动，对于美英帝国主义的阴谋是又一次严重的打击。社论强调指出：美国总统杜鲁门最近签署的所谓“共同安全法”，规定在苏联和人民民主国家组织间谍、破坏活动。这使共产党和工人党经常要加强和提高警惕性。而提高和加强革命警惕性的首要条件，是加强对干部的思想、政治教育和马克思—列宁主义的锻炼，使每个共产党人都有能力识别任何伪装的敌人。其次，必须很好地组织党内的工作，吸收党员为完成任务而积极参加工作，不顾情面地大力展开批评和自我批评。最后，必须保持和人民群众不可分的联系，教育人民对敌人的阴谋要特别提高警惕。社论结语说：靠了不倦地提高革命警惕性，坚决和漫不经心、自满和在政治上近视的现象作斗争，共产党和工人党将使它们的队伍更加巩固，并将能挫败敌人的一切阴谋。
    本期刊载了法国共产党书记杜克洛的“法国共产党为农民的利益而斗争”一文。杜克洛指出：第二次世界大战结束以后，法国又成为被占领的国家了。新占领者美国人在法国各地把农民逐出他们的土地，以便建造仓库和军火库，或夺取法国的财富。法国政府在美国的命令下实行战争的政策，已使预算赤字增加，因而势必给农民摊派新的捐税。另一方面，工业品和农产品价格的差别越来越悬殊。农业收入在国民收入中的比例正在下降，一九五一年农产品的出口比一九五○年降低了。这就使得小土地所有者和中等土地所有者遭受到经济的困难，法国的农业衰退了。杜克洛接着说：法国共产党坚持耕者有其田的观点。党的纲领特别规定：（一）发展经济的政策：和所有国家在平等的基础上建立正常贸易关系；增加工业品和农产品的输出；恢复农产品和工业品价格之间的平衡；限制地租。
    （二）平衡预算和民主征税的政策：不增加军费，减少目前的军事拨款；反对增加新的苛捐杂税的建议；向资本家征收超额利润税。（三）社会正义的政策：增加养老金和贫寒补助金；让劳动农民享有和产业工人相同的权利等等。杜克洛强调说：法国共产党是团结一切善良人民的党。农民中的共产党员必须不分党派和宗教信仰广泛地把农民团结起来；参加区农会、土地所有者联合会，并在那里进行工作和斗争，以争取保卫农民的政策的胜利。同时，农民是工人的天然同盟军，他们团结起来就会取得胜利。
    本期发表了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记契西尼夫斯奇的“共产党和工人党的政策是人民民主制度的最重要的基础”一文。作者说：领导着人民革命斗争的共产党和工人党，是以马克思——列宁主义科学为指南的。这一个强有力的武器使得共产党在历史发展的每一个阶段都能够正确地规定自己的行动方向，预见事变的发展进程，并在这个基础上确定战略和策略。作者指出：在第二次世界大战中，苏军打败了希特勒德国，东南欧人民民主国家诞生了。人民民主制度在其发展的第一个阶段，实质上是以工人阶级为领导的工农民主专政。在这个阶段中，共产党和工人党实行了深刻的民主改革。结果，共产党就创造了过渡到人民民主的第二阶段——无产阶级专政——的必要条件。在这个时候，反动的资产阶级和地主的政党在美英帝国主义的援助下，企图阻止人民民主国家中革命变革的实现。但是，劳动人民在共产党的领导下，粉碎了反革命的阴谋。作者接着说：人民民主国家的劳动人民现正着手奠定社会主义的经济基础，而且正为这个目的发展重工业。共产党和工人党制订了这样的政策：保证国家计划不仅为工业的发展、而且为农业和文化的发展规定具体的任务。这种政策是人民民主制度的最重要的基础。现在，所有人民民主国家都建立了新的工业部门，农业方面也在发生巨大的变化，劳动人民物质和文化生活水平正在提高。群众越来越体会到共产党和工人党的政策的正确性。
    本期并刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共产党主席哥特瓦尔德去年十二月在党中央全会上的报告：“论捷克斯洛伐克共产党党内生活的某些问题”，论述了斯兰斯基的叛党叛国的阴谋。本期还刊载了意大利共产党政治局委员巴也塔的“意大利劳动人民团结一致战胜水灾和反动派的阴谋”一文，论述了最近意大利北部的严重水灾问题。（新华社）
