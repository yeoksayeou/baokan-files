Cultural Life Brief Review

"People's Literature" Publishes Two Excellent Short Stories

"People's Literature" has recently published two excellent short stories in its last two issues: one is Qing Ni's "Chan River Ice Waves" (Volume 5, Issue 2), and the other is Malaqinfu's "People of the Horqin Grassland" (January 1952 issue). "Chan River Ice Waves" tells the story of Hu Bin, a soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's communications unit, who bravely and selflessly persisted in completing the task of connecting telephone lines amidst the rolling ice floes of the Chan River, overcoming immense difficulties. "People of the Horqin Grassland" depicts the patriotism of the Inner Mongolian people on the Horqin Grassland through the heroic actions of a young couple who simultaneously apprehended counter-revolutionaries and extinguished a wildfire set by counter-revolutionaries.

A significant characteristic shared by these two short stories is that they depict new themes, new lives, and new characters, reflecting the progressive forces in real life and educating the people with new ethical concepts and a new moral spirit. The authors did not pursue novel stories but simply wrote about ordinary people and how they bravely fought selflessly for the revolutionary cause and the happiness of the people. Therefore, although there are still some shortcomings in the writing and structure, their artistic brilliance cannot be concealed. The main characters in the stories are vividly portrayed and are all so lovable. Whether it is the ordinary soldier Hu Bin, or the young lovers, the cowherd girl and the young man Sangbu, they all possess a noble quality, they are so patriotic, so brave and fearless, so full of perseverance and tenacious fighting will, that those who read these two short stories cannot help but be moved by the noble qualities of these characters.

The task of our literature is to educate the people, and good works should have the effect of raising the readers' awareness and strengthening their confidence in fighting for tomorrow. This requires our writers to first have the political enthusiasm to make literature serve the people, be good at discovering and affirming the positive factors in life, be good at reflecting the fresh things full of development prospects, support them, praise them, and make them overcome those backward and dying things. The reason why the authors of "Chan River Ice Waves" and "People of the Horqin Grassland" were able to write such works is mainly because they are truly familiar with the new life and have deeply felt the progressive forces in this life. The authors of the two short stories are still very young newcomers to the literary world, and they have no reason to be complacent, but the emergence of such newcomers and new works gives us reason to celebrate and to believe in the growth of new literary warriors, and to believe that our literary circles are full of hope. "People's Literature" is also welcome to publish such excellent works; it is hoped that it and other literary publications will pay more attention to discovering new authors and publishing more excellent works of this kind that write about new themes, new lives, and new characters.

Three Suggestions for Spring Festival Yangko Teams

The Spring Festival is approaching, and many Yangko teams from government agencies, schools, and mass organizations are starting to become active. During rehearsals, some Yangko teams have already assigned who will play Chiang Kai-shek, who will play corrupt officials, and who will play bureaucrats, etc. This phenomenon is worth noting. Yangko dance was originally a collective mass dance, generally suitable for expressing the collective emotions of the masses, especially joyful emotions. Yangko opera is different from Yangko dance. In Yangko opera, more complex life plots can be expressed, and all classes and all characters can be represented, including degenerates and enemies. However, playing the role of the enemy in a Yangko dance or Yangko team, when they twist and jump together and parade through the streets, can easily create the impression of blurring the lines between the enemy and us, or of rejoicing with the enemy. Moreover, it is obviously wrong to equate general corrupt officials and bureaucrats with Chiang Kai-shek. Furthermore, Chiang Kai-shek and other reactionary remnants have long been spurned by the masses, and we should not allow this ugly image to reappear in the Yangko team without good reason. If the performance is a Yangko opera-style program, and the program must have the image of the enemy or backward elements, then such roles must play the embarrassing scene of being exposed, arrested, punished, and having nowhere to escape on the streets, or go to a predetermined location first for makeup, and should not perform joyful performances together on the streets after makeup.

Secondly, the female roles in the Yangko team should be played by female comrades. Judging from past experience and the current situation of rehearsals in some units, men playing female roles often uglify women. The performers' faces are painted blood red, they wear eye-catching clothes, and in addition, they wear a pair of black glasses, and make various frivolous and ugly expressions on their faces. Is this image a typical image of women in the new China? Isn't this a manifestation of backward psychology of belittling and slandering women? This phenomenon must be corrected.

Third, judging from past situations, Yangko teams often have extravagant waste phenomena, such as in clothing equipment and other consumption. This phenomenon should be corrected. We should promote a thrifty style in mass cultural and recreational activities.

    文化生活简评
    “人民文学”发表了两篇优秀的短篇小说
    “人民文学”最近两期登载了两篇优秀的短篇小说：一篇是晴霓的“蟾江冰波”（五卷二期），一篇是内蒙玛拉沁夫的“科尔沁草原的人们”（一九五二年一月号）。“蟾江冰波”写的是中国人民志愿军通讯部队的一个叫做胡宾的战士如何奋不顾身，坚持在翻滚着冰块的蟾江波浪中，克服极大困难，完成接通电话线任务的故事。“科尔沁草原的人们”是通过一对青年爱人同时所做的两件英勇行为，捉拿反革命分子，扑灭反革命分子所放的荒火，写出科尔沁草原上内蒙人民的爱国主义精神。
    这两篇小说所共有的一个显著特点，就是写了新的主题、新的生活、新的人物，反映了现实生活中先进的力量，用新的伦理观念和新的道德精神教育人民。作者并不是追求什么新奇的故事，而只是写出了一些普通的人物，在怎样勇敢地为革命事业和人民幸福而奋不顾身地斗争。因此，虽然在文字上和结构上还有一些缺点，它们的艺术的光辉却是掩盖不住的。故事中的主要人物都刻划得很生动，都是那样可爱。无论是那个普通的战士胡宾，或者是那一对年轻的爱人，牧牛姑娘同小伙子桑布，都同样具有一种崇高的品质，他们对祖国是那样热爱，那样的勇敢无畏，那样充满了毅力和顽强的战斗意志，使得读完这两篇小说的人们都不能不为这些人物的高尚品质所感动。
    我们文学的任务是教育人民，好的作品应该产生提高读者的觉悟和增强他们为明天而斗争的信心的作用。这就要求我们的作家首先必须具有使文学为人民服务的政治热情，善于发现和肯定生活中的积极因素，善于反映那些充满发展前途的新鲜事物，支持它们，颂扬它们，使它们战胜那些落后的正在衰亡的东西。“蟾江冰波”同“科尔沁草原的人们”的作者所以能写出这样的作品，主要原因就是他们真正熟悉新的生活，并且深刻地感受了这种生活中的前进的力量。两个短篇的作者都还是年纪很轻的文坛新人，他们没有骄傲自满的理由，但是这样的新人和新作品的出现，却使我们有理由加以庆贺，有理由相信新的文艺战士的成长，相信我们的文艺界是大有希望的。“人民文学”发表这样的优秀作品，也是值得欢迎的；希望它和旁的文艺刊物更多注意发现新的作者，更多发表这一类写新的主题、新的生活、新的人物的优秀作品。
    对春节秧歌队的三点建议
    春节就要来到，许多机关、学校、群众团体的秧歌队开始活跃起来。在练习期间，有的秧歌队已派定谁扮蒋介石，谁扮贪污分子，谁扮官僚主义分子等。这一现象是值得注意的。秧歌舞原是一种集体性的群众舞蹈，一般适宜于表现群众集体的情绪，特别是欢乐的情绪。秧歌剧和秧歌舞不同，在秧歌剧中可以表现比较复杂的生活情节，可以表现一切阶级，一切人物，包括蜕化堕落分子和敌人等角色在内。但在秧歌舞或秧歌队中扮演敌人角色，当其共同扭跳，招摇过市的时候，极容易产生敌我不分或与敌同乐的印象。而且把一般的贪污分子、官僚主义者和蒋介石并列一起，也显然是错误的。再说，蒋介石等反动残余早已被群众唾弃，我们不应该毫无理由地让这一丑恶形象再出现在秧歌队里。如果演出的是秧歌剧性质的节目，节目中必须有敌人或落后分子的形象，那么这样的角色必须在街道上扮演被揭发、被捉拿、被惩办和无路可逃的狼狈相，或者先到预定地点，进行化装，不应该化装好了还和大家一起在街道上作欢乐的表演。
    其次，秧歌队中的女角，应由女同志担任。就过去的经验和现在某些单位排演的情形看来，男人扮女角，往往丑化了女性。扮演者的脸上擦得血红，身上穿起触目的衣服，此外再戴一副黑眼镜，脸上做出种种轻薄难看的表情，这形象难道是新中国女性的典型吗？这不是轻视妇女和污蔑妇女的落后心理的表现吗？这种现象是必须纠正的。
    第三，从以往的情形看，秧歌队常有铺张浪费的现象，如在服装设备及其他消耗方面。这种现象应加改正。我们应在群众性的文化娱乐生活中提倡节约的作风。
