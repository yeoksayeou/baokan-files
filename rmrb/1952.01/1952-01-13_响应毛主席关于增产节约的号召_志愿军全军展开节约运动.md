    Xinhua News Agency Report: To respond to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and practicing thrift, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA) on the Korean front has launched a thrift campaign throughout the entire army. Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing thrift, along with the CPVA Party Committee's instructions on launching a thrift campaign, were rapidly transmitted to the frontline troops. The vast numbers of CPVA commanders, fighters, and logistics personnel, on the positions, in the fortifications, on the transportation lines, and during breaks in intense combat and work, engaged in discussions on how to eliminate more enemies and practice thrift. Various units have successively formulated specific thrift plans for 1952. In the thrift plans, some units have already proposed donating the value of the savings for airplanes and artillery. According to the thrift plans democratically discussed by the soldiers, the Party Committee of a certain CPVA unit estimates that it will save 20 billion RMB this year, which can buy thirteen jet fighters. A certain unit plans to save one shirt, one pair of shoes, and one towel per person this year, and not to receive mosquito nets or heating allowances, which can save about 3 billion RMB for the public. The CPVA logistics and transportation units plan to save on automobile repair costs, vehicle parts replacement costs, and transportation costs this year. The value of the savings in the first half of the year alone can account for 25% of the budget for the first half of the year. In the discussions, commanders, political workers, and logistics personnel put forward: "Continue to carry forward the working style of hard work and plain living, burying oneself in hard work, precisely organizing battles, and striving for greater victories." Soldiers put forward in the discussions: "Cherish weapons and equipment," "Don't shoot without aiming, let every bullet eliminate an enemy." Cooks put forward: "Don't throw away leftover rice, don't discard pot scrapings," "Gather more firewood." Soldiers of a certain unit also put forward specific methods such as saving one or two liang of rice per person per day to help Korean refugees.
