Gong Yuzhi's "Correcting the Tendency of Scientific Publications to Detach from Politics and Reality" (a review of "Science Bulletin" Volume II) has been reprinted in the first issue of "Science Bulletin" Volume III. His criticism is very correct, and we sincerely accept it. We have decided to improve our editorial work starting with the first issue of Volume III in an effort to correct our past mistakes.

As Comrade Gong pointed out, the "tendency to detach from politics and reality" in the "Science Bulletin" is very serious, and the key lies in the lack of ideological leadership. Although the basic task of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is to "establish the viewpoint of scientific research serving the people and closely integrating with practice" and to "strengthen the political study of researchers so that they can grasp the viewpoints and methods of Marxism-Leninism," the "Science Bulletin," as the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, completely ignored these most important basic tasks. With this fundamental neglect, a series of serious errors, as pointed out by Comrade Gong, were inevitably derived in the content of this journal.

Our negligence is truly unforgivable. In addition to the serious shortcomings listed by Comrade Gong, we would also like to conduct a self-criticism of one or two major errors here.

The first is our negligent attitude towards Comrade Stalin's classic work "On Marxism in Linguistics." This is an epoch-making scientific work, a brilliant contribution to the treasure of Marxism-Leninism. It is of great significance not only to social sciences but also to all natural sciences. This work has been elaborated, studied, and applied by the scientific community in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries as a central issue, and it has also had a wide and profound impact on China's ideological and academic circles. When this work was translated by Comrade Li Lisan in July 1950, before it was published in the "People's Daily" (July 11), President Guo Moruo instructed us to reprint this work. However, we completely ignored such an important matter. We neither reprinted this classic work nor organized scientific workers to study and discuss it. Our ideological numbness has reached an alarming level.

The second is our confused understanding of Einstein's idealist thought. In the twelfth issue of Volume II, we published Karpov's "On Einstein's Philosophical Views," which strictly criticized the ideological stance of this "great physicist, but also a very small philosopher." There is a passage in the article:

	“Modern physics does not provide any arguments that conform to idealism. However, despite the fact that physics contains materialist content, many scholars, including Einstein, hold idealist views in their philosophical interpretation of physics. ... Einstein's views are manifested in the recognition of world rationality, in the finite and expanding cosmology, in the affirmation that objects are a composite of sensations, in the affirmation that matter and energy can be transformed into each other, and so on."

This exposes Einstein's idealist views very clearly. However, we made a presumptuous and clever note under "matter and energy can be transformed into each other," saying:

	“'Matter and energy can be transformed into each other' is based on experimental evidence and is not an idealist argument. There is no error in the translation here; it is an inappropriate point in the original text."

In this way, it fully shows that we are muddle-headed idealists who are defending Einstein. In the old physics, matter and energy were treated as dual entities. Old physicists considered things with mass properties to be matter, and energy could be independent of matter. The conservation of energy and the conservation of mass were two major principles that stood in opposition to each other. However, in modern new physics, this dualism has been criticized. Dialectical materialist new physics believes that energy and mass are both forms of matter's existence. Light energy was previously considered by physicists to be a form of energy that existed independently of matter, but it was later proven that light energy is the movement of photons, and photons are moving matter, which can be transformed into positive and negative electrons under certain conditions. Therefore, light energy is a form of matter's movement. We can no longer stand on the position of dualism to talk about "the mutual transformation of matter and energy," but should recognize that the mass of matter and the energy of matter can be transformed into each other. The mass of matter and the energy of matter can be transformed into each other is not only not contrary to dialectical materialism, but on the contrary, it proves the correctness of dialectical materialism. The statement in the footnote that "matter and energy can be transformed into each other is based on experimental evidence and is not an idealist argument" is completely wrong. What the experiment proves is only that the mass of matter and the energy of matter can be transformed into each other, not that matter and energy can be transformed into each other. To say that "matter and energy can be transformed into each other" is an idealist argument. Because we made such a mistake, we also fell into the deep mire of idealism along with Einstein. We are in the great Mao Zedong era, and studying Marxism-Leninism is our major task. However, we are still confused about the issues that Lenin had already resolved in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism." Can such confused thinking be tolerated? We are prepared to further discuss this ideological issue and will only make this preliminary self-criticism here. Thus, our lack of sensitivity to new things and our reluctance to let go of outdated views show our low level of ideological and political awareness. Due to our low level of ideological and political awareness, the lack of ideological and political content in the editing of this journal is inevitable. This is our fundamental mistake. Now that we have clearly recognized our mistakes, the method of correcting them is clearly presented to us. What is the method? It is to strengthen our ideological transformation and political study. However, this is not only a requirement for a few of us, but should also be a requirement for the entire scientific community. The lack of ideological and political awareness among scientific workers, we must admit, is still a fairly common phenomenon. Therefore, starting from the first issue of Volume III, we have decided to gradually improve according to the principle of transforming ideology and raising political level. In the most recent issue of "Science Bulletin," we published the mobilization reports of President Guo Moruo and Director Fan Wenlan in the ideological transformation study movement. We believe that these two articles will be helpful in raising the political and ideological awareness of our scientific workers.

Furthermore, in addition to reprinting Comrade Gong Yuzhi's criticism, we have also published Comrade Gong's translations of the two editorials in "Pravda" criticizing the Soviet Academy of Sciences: "Enhance the Role of Party Organizations in Scientific Institutions" (August 10, 1950) and "Strengthen the Connection between Scientific Workers and Production" (September 17, 1951). The Soviet Union is our teacher, and these criticisms are, of course, references for us in improving our ideological and political awareness.

It has been thirty-four years since the victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, and yet some research work of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is still detached from reality and still needs to strengthen ideological leadership, which shows how arduous a struggle process it is for scientific research to be coordinated with practice and for the ideological awareness of scientists to be improved. However, we must not seek any excuses for self-relief here. We must not think like this: "Soviet scientists have been doing it for thirty-four years and are still being criticized. We have only been doing it for more than two years, so let's take our time." If anyone finds such a lazy excuse, then that would be an unforgivable mistake. The level, degree, and speed are different. Our scientific research work cannot be compared with that of the Soviet Union. If Soviet scientists need to make ten times the effort to strengthen their ideological and political awareness, then we must make a thousand times the effort. Today, we must catch up quickly in order to meet the actual needs and also catch up with the level of Soviet science.

We want to reiterate some of the words that President Guo Moruo said in the inaugural issue of "Science Bulletin" here:

	"Our work today is still a new beginning. Defects are unavoidable, and even errors are unavoidable. However, we have the determination, sincerity, and faith to gradually do our work well."

	"We must make good use of the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to constantly spur ourselves, supplement defects, and correct errors; and we hope that all scientific workers in China can do the same."

### “科学通报”编者的自我检讨

专栏：

    “科学通报”编者的自我检讨
    龚育之同志的“纠正科学刊物中脱离政治脱离实际的倾向”（评“科学通报”第二卷），我们已经转载在“科学通报”第三卷第一期里面了。他的批评是十分正确的，我们诚恳地接受，并已决定从第三卷第一期起努力改进编辑工作，以求纠正我们以往的错误。
    诚如龚同志所指责，“科学通报”的“脱离政治、脱离实际的倾向”是很严重的，而其关键是在缺乏思想领导。尽管中国科学院的基本任务，是在“确定科学研究为人民服务的观点，与实际密切配合”，是在“加强研究人员的政治学习，俾能把握马克思列宁主义的观点与方法”，但作为中国科学院院刊的“科学通报”却根本忽略了这些最重要的基本任务。有了这一个根本疏忽，在本刊的内容上便不可避免地导引出如龚同志所指责的一连串的严重错误了。
    我们的疏忽实在是不可饶恕的。除掉龚同志所列举的一些严重的缺点之外，我们在这里还要自行检讨一两项重大的错误。
    第一项是对于斯大林同志的经典著作“论马克思主义在语言学中的问题”，我们所采取的疏忽的态度。这是一篇划时期的科学论著，是马克思列宁主义宝藏中的一个杰出的贡献。它不仅对于社会科学有极大的意义，对于一切自然科学也都有极大的意义。这一论著，苏联科学界和各人民民主国家的科学界都在作为中心问题而加以阐发、学习和运用，我国的思想界和学术界也受到了很广泛而深刻的影响。当这篇论著在一九五○年七月由李立三同志译出，尚未在“人民日报”（七月十一日）登出之前，郭沫若院长即曾关照过我们，一定要转载这篇论著。但我们却把这样重要的一件事情完全置诸度外了。这篇经典论著我们既未转载，也未组织科学工作者来进行研究和讨论，我们在思想上的麻木不仁，实在是到了惊人的地步。
    第二项是对于爱因斯坦的唯心主义思想，我们所怀抱的糊涂的认识。在二卷十二期中我们登载了卡尔波夫的“论爱因斯坦的哲学观点”，严格地批判了这位“大物理学家，但也是很小的哲学家”的思想立场。文中有这么一段。
    “现代的物理学并没有提供出丝毫合乎唯心主
    义的论证。可是，不论事实上物理学含有唯物主
    义的内容，有许多学者们，连爱因斯坦也在内，却
    在其对物理学的哲学解释方面，都抱有着唯心主
    义的观点。……爱因斯坦的观点正表现在承认世
    界理性，在有穷而膨胀的宇宙论，在确言物体是
    感觉的复合，在确言物质与能可以互相转变等等
    方面”。
    这把爱因斯坦的唯心主义观点揭发得十分明确。但我们却在“物质与能可以相互转变”下妄作聪明地加了一个注脚，这样说道：
    “‘物质与能可以互相转变’是有实验根据
    的，并非唯心主义的论调，这里译文无误，是原文
    不妥之处。”
    这样一来，便十足地表明了我们是袒护爱因斯坦的糊涂的唯心论者了。物质和能在旧物理学中是作为二元而处理着的。旧物理学者把具有质量性质的东西认为是物质，能是可以离开物质而独立的。能量不灭与质量不灭是互相对峙的二大原理。但在近代的新物理学中，这种二元论已被批判了。辩证唯物主义的新物理学认为，能和质量都是物质存在的形态。光能从前曾被物理学者认为是一种离开物质而独立存在的能，但后来证明，光能是光子的运动，而光子是运动着的物质，在一定的条件下又可以转变为正电子和负电子，因此，光能是物质的运动的一种形态。我们不能再站在二元论的立场，来谈“物质与能的互相转变”，而应该承认物质的质量和物质的能量是可以互相转变的。物质的质量与物质的能量可以互相转变，不但不是违背辩证唯物论，恰恰相反，这证明了辩证唯物论的正确性。注脚中所说“物质与能可以互相转变是有实验根据的，并非唯心主义的论调”，是完全错误的。实验所证明的，只是物质的质量与物质的能量可以互相转变，并不是物质与能可以互相转变。说“物质与能可以互相转变”，就是唯心主义的论调。因为犯了这样的错误，所以我们也就跟着爱因斯坦一道堕入深沉的唯心主义的泥沼里去了。我们处在伟大的毛泽东时代，学习马克思列宁主义是我们的重大任务，然而列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”中已经解决了的问题我们却依然是糊涂的。这样的糊涂思想，难道是可以容恕的吗？——关于这一思想问题我们已经准备进一步地展开讨论，在这里就只作这样初步的自我检讨，不再多说。就这样，我们对于新鲜事物缺乏敏感，而对于陈腐观点则留恋不舍，这就表明我们的思想性和政治性的低下。由于我们的思想性和政治性的低下也就必然导引出本刊编辑上的思想性和政治性的缺乏。这就是我们的根本错误。明确地知道了错误，纠正错误的方法也就坦陈在我们的面前了。方法是什么呢？就是要我们加强思想改造和政治学习。但这不单是对于我们少数同人的要求，应该也是对于整个科学界的要求。科学工作者的缺乏思想性和政治性，我们应该承认还是相当普遍的现象。因此，我们从三卷一期起，已经决定依据改造思想和提高政治水平的这个方针，逐步加以改进。我们在“科学通报”最近一期中揭载了郭沫若院长和范文澜所长在思想改造学习运动中的动员报告，我们认为这两篇文章对于我们科学工作者的政治性和思想性的提高是会有帮助的。
    再者，我们在转载了龚育之同志的这篇批评文字之外，还把龚同志所翻译的“真理报”批评苏联科学院的两篇社论：“提高科学机构中党组织底作用”（一九五○年八月十日）和“加强科学工作者与生产的联系”（一九五一年九月十七日）也一并登出了。苏联是我们的老师，这些批评当然也就是我们在提高思想性和政治性上的借鉴。
    苏联自十月革命胜利以来已经三十四年了，而苏联科学院的一部分研究工作仍然脱离实际，仍然要加强思想领导，足见科学研究要和实际配合，科学家的思想性的提高，是多么艰巨的一个斗争过程。但我们从这里千万不要去寻找丝毫解嘲的藉口。我们千万不要这样作想：“苏联的科学家们搞了三十四年了都还在受批评，我们才两年多，慢慢来吧。”假如我们有人找着了这样懒惰的藉口，那就要算是犯了不可救药的错误。水准不同，程度不同，速度不同，我们的科学研究工作和苏联的还不能相提并论。假使苏联的科学家在思想性和政治性的加强上要用十倍的努力，我们就须得用一千倍的努力。我们今天要急起直追才能够赶得上实际需要，也才能够赶得上苏联科学的水平。
    郭沫若院长在“科学通报”发刊词里面说过的几句话，我们要在这里重新申述一遍：
    “我们的工作今天还是一个新的开端，缺陷是难免的，甚至于错误也是难免的，但我们有决心，有诚意，有信念，希望逐步地把工作做好。”
    “我们要好好地运用批评和自我批评这项武器来经常鞭策自己，补充缺陷，改正错误；并希望全中国的科学工作者们都能够这样做。”
