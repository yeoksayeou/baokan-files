Using Criticism and Self-Criticism Methods to Carry Out the Ideological Remolding Movement

    The Industrial and Commercial Circles Should Universally and Thoroughly Launch an Ideological Remolding Movement
    Fu Huating, Director of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce
    (1) Why Should the Industrial and Commercial Circles Launch an Ideological Remolding Movement?
    Ideological remolding is a common requirement of all democratic classes in our country. Because the entire society is developing rapidly, we cannot adapt to social development if we do not carry out ideological remolding. But what is used as the standard and direction of advancement for ideological remolding? Chairman Mao said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "With the people's state, the people have the possibility of using democratic methods, on a national scale and in their entirety, to educate and remold themselves, to free themselves from the influence of domestic and foreign reactionaries (this influence is still very great and will exist for a long time, and cannot be quickly eliminated), to remold the bad habits and bad thoughts they have acquired from the old society, so that they will not embark on the wrong path guided by the reactionaries, and will continue to advance towards socialist society and communist society." This is the standard and direction of advancement for our ideological remolding.
    From this point of view, our industrial and commercial circles are even more in need of remolding. Because in the revolution and construction, our class has two sides, with a dark and corrupt side. If we do not carry out ideological remolding, it is easy to continue the essence of seeking profit and engaging in speculation, resulting in bribery, fraud, profiteering, tax evasion, and other illegal acts, stealing state property, harming the interests of the people, and corrupting state personnel to seek the private interests of the smallest number of people. This is absolutely not allowed in a people's state. Therefore, only by enthusiastically participating in various movements led by the state, eliminating all actions harmful to the state and the people in thought and practice, and establishing the view of striving to serve the people according to policies and laws, and overcoming the bad idea of selfishness, can we have our own bright future. To achieve this, we must study Mao Zedong Thought, study the Common Program and policies and laws, use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize our bad thoughts and bad habits, and remold ourselves. From this point of view, isn't the important significance of ideological remolding obvious?
    (2) What Ideological Changes Have Taken Place in the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Since Liberation?
    The industrial and commercial circles are very much in need of ideological remolding, and at the same time, it is possible to achieve the goal of remolding. The ideological changes in the Beijing industrial and commercial circles after liberation can prove this point. The Beijing industrial and commercial circles have always adhered to established practices in business and have been feudal and conservative in thought. After liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and influenced by the strong political atmosphere of the people's capital, their thoughts have gradually changed. These changes can be roughly divided into four stages:
    (1) Early days of liberation – At that time, most industrialists and businessmen did not understand the policies and had a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude towards the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. They felt distressed and had no future, and were not active in business operations. Therefore, there were many problems in labor-capital relations and public-private relations. In addition, some people still had bad habits such as speculation, tax evasion, and disturbing prices in their business operations; some exposed the phenomenon of blind production. After the People's Government's continuous patient education and measures to stabilize prices, everyone had a preliminary understanding of the policies.
    (2) The stage of adjusting industry and commerce – Since the People's Government contracted currency and unified fiscal revenue and expenditure, industry and commerce experienced temporary difficulties. The People's Government vigorously supported them in response to the situation at that time, helping industry and commerce overcome the difficulties at that time by means of processing, ordering, purchasing, and loans. Later, due to the beginning of price stability and the increase in farmers' purchasing power after land reform, Beijing's industry and commerce began to show new prosperity after the autumn of 1950. Therefore, when industrialists and businessmen felt the greatness of the people's power, they had a further understanding of labor-capital relations and public-private relations, and improved their enthusiasm for business operations.
    (3) The stage of the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries – Industrialists and businessmen were generally educated in patriotism combined with internationalism, and were inspired by the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. They also personally experienced the significant role of land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, began to develop patriotism, actively responded to the call to donate airplanes and cannons, enthusiastically paid taxes, assisted the government in stabilizing prices, developed urban and rural trade, and eliminated their pro-American, worshipful-American, and fear-American thoughts. The progress in their thinking has been initially reflected in their actions. (4) The current stage – At present, the industrial and commercial circles are carrying out rectification studies and responding to Chairman Mao's call to fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. All members of the units under the Federation of Industry and Commerce, various industries, offices, branches, and stall markets have launched this study under the leadership of the study committees at all levels. In the rectification study, they have begun to learn to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and establish a loyal and honest work style. In the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the focus of study in the Beijing industrial and commercial circles is on opposing corruption and bribery. Under the advocacy of Mayor Peng Zhen and the Beijing Savings Inspection Committee, many mobilization meetings have been held, and the savings inspection branch of the Federation of Industry and Commerce has mobilized some responsible members of the units under the Federation of Industry and Commerce to take the lead in confessing. Some industrialists and businessmen have confessed to bribery in order to seek lenient treatment from the government. It is now in a stage of intense ideological struggle.
    (3) How Should the Industrial and Commercial Circles Carry Out Ideological Remolding in the Future?
    Amidst the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and construction, under the strong leadership of the government, the ideological situation of the industrial and commercial circles has undergone drastic changes, and the level of awareness has gradually increased. They have realized the needs of the new society and the necessity of thoroughly remolding themselves, and the necessity of further establishing a new outlook on life. Based on this, we should consider the steps and methods for carrying out ideological remolding in the future. Regarding this matter, I personally believe that it should be carried out in this way: (1) Use collective power to remold thoughts through various political movements. We should recognize the significant impact of revolution on people's thoughts, strive to participate in various political movements, and use collective power to remold thoughts. We should continue to carry out mass movements like the past rectification study and historical confession movement and the current anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement, carry out universal and in-depth mobilization, and make it known to every household. In this way, ideological remolding will achieve great results, and various influences of domestic and foreign reactionaries can be gradually eliminated; various bad habits and misconceptions from the old society can be remolded; mistakes can be avoided, and we can continue to move forward; and the dark and corrupt side of our class character can be overcome so that it cannot play a destructive role in the new society. (2) Carry out the study movement of ideological remolding in an organized and led manner. We should voluntarily participate in the study in accordance with the content decided by the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on launching the study movement of ideological remolding.
    Regarding the study of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, we admit that the educational level of the industrial and commercial circles is generally not high; it is not easy to correctly understand the future of the Chinese revolution directly from studying revolutionary theories. Therefore, except for a few industrialists and businessmen with higher ideological and cultural levels, most industrialists and businessmen should gradually recognize the laws of social development, gradually recognize our correct path from new democracy to socialism, gradually accept the scientific worldview and outlook on life, and gradually recognize the weaknesses of their class character, and strive to correct these weaknesses in the study of the Common Program and important policies and laws, in the criticism and self-criticism of practical movements, and in the study of political common sense. Regarding the study of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and other important documents, we should recognize that since the industrial and commercial circles are an integral part of the Chinese people, they should use the Common Program and policies and laws of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as their action indicator, and establish the view of subordinating individual interests to overall interests in different periods and environments, and handle business in accordance with the principle of taking into account both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital in various national economic measures. Premier Zhou once pointed out: "In new democratic China, first, we cannot talk about taking into account both public and private interests in isolation, but must talk about taking into account both public and private interests under the condition of obeying the state's economic leadership... Second, we cannot talk about benefiting both labor and capital in the abstract, but must talk about benefiting both labor and capital under the premise of recognizing the leadership of the working class... Third, we cannot advocate blind production, but must gradually realize the leadership of the state's overall production plan... Fourth, we cannot allow profiteering, but can only obtain legal profits within the limits stipulated or agreed upon by the state; Fifth, we cannot allow illegal acts such as bribery, fraud, tax evasion, theft, and enticement to continue to occur, allowing them to erode the people's regime, damage state property, and corrupt state personnel." He also said: "What the People's Government protects and welcomes are those industrialists and businessmen who support the Common Program and abide by government laws and regulations, not those industrialists and businessmen who want to develop freely, engage in blind production, and seek profiteering without leadership and restrictions. If Chinese industrialists and businessmen develop in the direction of the Common Program, abide by national policies and laws, and obey the leadership of the state-owned economy and the state production plan, then their future is bright; they can not only fully develop their undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood in the current period, but also certainly get opportunities to work and retain their consumer property when the whole country transitions to socialism in the future." In order to implement this instruction, we industrialists and businessmen should further study policies and laws and eliminate all erroneous thoughts that run counter to policies and laws. Regarding rectification, that is, the issue of implementing criticism and self-criticism. We know that the advanced and organized troops of the Chinese working class—the Chinese Communist Party—in addition to frequently conducting criticism and self-criticism, also concentrate on adopting measures such as rectification movements to continuously transform and improve their members. In order to transform themselves, our industrial and commercial organizations themselves and various industrialists and businessmen should frequently use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to carry out rectification, gradually criticize various backward thoughts and actions in various practical movements, and promote everyone to move forward. In this anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles, it was precisely because the industrial and commercial organizations took the lead in confessing that the movement achieved better development. Therefore, all rectification and the launching of criticism and self-criticism should be implemented from top to bottom.
    In short, ideological remolding has become a universal requirement of the industrial and commercial circles. To launch this movement, it is necessary to mobilize the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to participate together. In the movement, new ideas must be used to overcome old ideas. In the past, we participated in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the rectification study movement. We are now launching the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement. These are all good opportunities for the industrial and commercial circles to transform their thinking. We should consolidate our current achievements, learn from experience, improve our working methods, and add new content, so that the ideological remolding movement can develop, so that all industrialists and businessmen can systematically study the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in a step-by-step manner; all can obtain the necessary ideological weapons to help themselves make correct judgments on everything, understand the basic problems of the Chinese revolution, and thoroughly transform themselves; and at this stage, work hard to develop production and prosper the economy; and continue to move forward, together with the masses of the people, towards a happy socialist and communist society.

### 工商界应该普遍地深入地展开思想改造运动

专栏：用批评和自我批评的方法开展思想改造运动

    工商界应该普遍地深入地展开思想改造运动
    北京市工商业联合会主任　傅华亭
    （一）工商界为什么要展开思想改造运动
    思想改造是我国各民主阶级的共有要求。因为整个社会是迅速向前发展的，如果我们不进行思想改造，就不可能和社会发展相适应。可是，思想改造是用什么来做标准和前进方向呢？毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中说：“有了人民的国家，人民才有可能，在全国范围内和全体规模上，用民主的方法，教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响（这个影响现在还是很大的，并将在长时期内存在着，不能很快地消灭），改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，不使自己走入反动派指引的错误路上去，并继续前进，向着社会主义社会和共产主义社会发展。”这就是我们进行思想改造的标准和前进的方向。
    从这里看，我们工商界是更加需要改造的。因为在革命和建设中，我们阶级具有两面性，具有黑暗腐朽的一面。如果不进行思想改造，那就很容易持续着唯利是图、投机取巧的本质，而产生行贿、欺诈、暴利、偷税漏税等犯法行为，盗窃国家财产，危害人民利益，腐蚀国家工作人员，来营求最少数人的私利，这在人民国家里，是绝对不能容许的。所以只有热烈地参加国家所领导的各项运动，从思想上，实践中，来铲除有害于国家人民的一切行为，根据政策法令来建立努力服务于人民的观点，克服自私自利的恶劣观念，才有自己的光明前途。而要做到这一点，就必须学习毛泽东思想，学习共同纲领和政策法令，用毛泽东思想来批判自己的坏思想和坏习惯，来改造自己。从这点看来，思想改造的重要意义不是很明显的吗？
    （二）解放后北京工商界在思想上有了那些转变
    工商界是非常需要进行思想改造，同时又是有可能达到改造的目的的。北京工商界在解放后的思想变化，即可证明这一点。北京工商界向来在经营上墨守成规，思想上封建保守。解放后，受到中国共产党和人民政府的领导以及人民首都的浓厚的政治气氛的薰陶影响，思想上逐渐有了变化，这种变化，大体可以分做四个阶段：
    （一）解放初期——那时绝大部分工商业者不了解政策，对中国共产党和人民政府存在着怀疑观望的心理，感到苦闷和没有前途，不积极经营业务，因此，劳资关系和公私关系都有许多问题。另外有一部分人在业务上还有投机倒把、偷漏捐税、搅动物价等恶习；一部分则暴露着有盲目生产的现象。经过人民政府不断地耐心教育和采取稳定物价的措施，大家才对政策有了初步的认识。
    （二）调整工商业阶段——自从人民政府收缩通货，实现财政收支统一以后，工商业发生了暂时的困难。人民政府针对当时情况大力扶植，以加工、定货、收购、贷款等方法，帮助工商业渡过了当时的困难。以后由于物价开始稳定，土地改革后农民购买力提高，北京工商业在一九五○年秋后开始有了新的繁荣气象。于是正当工商业者感到人民力量的伟大，对劳资关系和公私关系有了进一步的认识，提高了经营积极性。
    （三）抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命的三大运动阶段——工商业者普遍地受到爱国主义和国际主义相结合的教育，受到中国人民志愿军抗美援朝反侵略战争辉煌胜利的鼓舞；又亲自体验到土地改革和镇压反革命的重大作用，开始发挥爱国主义精神，积极响应捐献飞机大炮的号召，踊跃纳税，协助政府稳定物价，开展城乡贸易，扫除自己的亲美、崇美、恐美等思想，思想上的进步并已初步表现到行动上面来。（四）现阶段——目前工商界正在进行整风学习，并响应毛主席号召，进行反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争。工商联所属单位、各行业、各办事处、各分会、各摊贩市场全体委员在各级学委会领导下，都已展开这种学习。在整风学习中，已开始学会划分敌我立场，建立忠诚老实的作风。在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义斗争中，北京工商界学习重点是反对贪污和反对行贿。在彭真市长及北京市节约检查委员会倡导下，已经开了许多次动员大会，并由工商界节约检查分会动员，工商联所属各单位部分负责委员带头坦白，一部分工商业者已交代了行贿问题，以求政府的宽大处理。现在正处在激烈的思想斗争阶段。
    （三）工商界今后如何来进行思想改造
    在中国人民革命和建设的伟大胜利当中，在政府的坚强领导下，工商界的思想情况已经有了急剧的转变，觉悟水平已经逐步提高。他们认识到新社会的需要，和彻底地改造自己的必要性，认识到进一步建立新的人生观的必要性。根据这一点，我们就应该考虑今后进行思想改造的步骤和方法了。关于这件事情，我个人认为应该这样进行：（一）通过各项政治运动，用集体力量来改造思想。我们应该认识革命对人民思想的重大影响，努力参加各项政治运动，用集体力量改造思想。应该继续开展像过去整风学习交代历史运动和目前开展反贪污反行贿运动一样的群众性运动，进行普遍地深入地动员，作到家喻户晓。这样，思想改造才会收到很大效果，才能逐步肃清国内外反动派的各种影响；才能改造自己从旧社会得来的各种恶习谬见；才能避免误入迷途，继续前进；才能克服我们阶级性中黑暗腐朽的那一面，使它不能在新社会中起破坏作用。（二）有组织有领导地展开思想改造的学习运动。我们应该依照中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会关于展开思想改造的学习运动决定的内容，自愿地参加学习。
    对于学习马列主义的基本理论，我们承认工商界的文化程度一般来说是不高的；要直接从学习革命理论来正确了解中国革命前途是不容易的。因此，除少数有较高思想水平和文化水平的工商业者外，大多数工商业者应该在学习共同纲领和重要政策法令中，在实际运动的批评和自我批评中，在学习政治常识中，逐渐认识到社会发展的规律，逐渐认识我们由新民主主义过渡到社会主义的正确道路，逐渐接受科学的宇宙观和人生观，逐渐认识自己阶级性的弱点，而努力改正这些弱点。对于学习人民政协共同纲领和其他重要文件的问题，我们应该认识，工商界既是中国人民的组成部分，就应该以人民政协共同纲领和政策法令作为自己行动的指标，在不同时期和不同环境中建立起以个人利益服从整体利益的观点，在国家各项经济措施中，本着公私兼顾劳资两利的原则来处理业务。周总理曾经这样指出：“在新民主主义的中国，第一、不能孤立地讲公私兼顾，而一定要在服从国家经济领导的条件下讲公私兼顾……第二、不能抽象地讲劳资两利，而一定要在承认工人阶级领导的前提下讲劳资两利……第三、不能提倡盲目生产，而一定要逐步实现国家生产总计划的领导……第四、不能容许谋取暴利，而只能在国家规定的限度或议定的价格内取得合法利润；第五、不能容许行贿、欺诈、偷漏、盗窃、引诱等犯法行为继续发生，听其侵蚀人民政权，损害国家财产，腐蚀国家工作人员。”又说：“人民政府所保护和欢迎的是那些拥护共同纲领、服从政府法令的工商业家，而不是那些不受领导和限制而想自由发展、盲目生产、贪图暴利的工商业家。中国的工商业家如果按共同纲领的方向发展，遵守国家政策法令，服从国营经济和国家生产计划的领导，那么，他们的出路是光明的；他们不但在目前时期可以充分地发展他们的有利于国计民生的事业，而且在将来全国转入社会主义的时期，也一定可以得到工作的机会，并且可以保留他们的消费财产。”我们工商业者，要执行这个指示，就应该进一步学习政策、法令，肃清一切抵触政策法令的错误思想。对于整风，即实行批评和自我批评问题。我们知道，中国工人阶级先进的有组织的部队——中国共产党，除了经常进行批评和自我批评以外，还要集中地采用整风运动等措施来不断地改造和提高自己的党员。我们工商界组织本身以及各种工商业者为了改造自己，是应该经常用批评和自我批评的武器来进行整风，逐步在各种实际运动中批评各种落后的思想行动，推动大家前进的。在这次北京工商界反贪污、反行贿运动中，就是由于工商业组织首先带头坦白，才使运动得到了较好的发展。所以一切整风和展开批评和自我批评都是应该自上而下地贯彻下去的。
    总之，思想改造，已成为工商界的普遍要求。要展开这个运动，是需要动员广大工商业者一齐来参加的。在运动中，必须用新的思想来克服旧的思想。过去我们参加了抗美援朝运动、整风学习运动，现在正在开展反贪污反行贿运动，这都是工商界改造思想的良好机会。我们应该巩固目前成绩，并吸取经验，改进工作方法，增添新的内容，使思想改造运动发展下去，以求全体工商业者都能有步骤有系统地学习马列主义基本理论和毛泽东思想；都能得到必要的思想武器，来帮助自己对一切事物都能够作正确的判断，了解中国革命的基本问题，彻底改造自己；在现阶段为发展生产繁荣经济而努力；并继续前进，和人民大众一道走向幸福的社会主义和共产主义社会。
