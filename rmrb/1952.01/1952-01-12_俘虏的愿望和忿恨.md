    Every prisoner has this earnest wish: "Let us go home soon!" However, in the Korean armistice negotiations, the US side has repeatedly resorted to delaying tactics, making the prisoners' wishes seem indefinitely out of reach.
    At the beginning of the subcommittee on the fourth item of the Korean armistice negotiations agenda, the representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides proposed the principle of quickly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice. This completely reasonable principle brought great comfort to the prisoners. American and British prisoners in a prisoner-of-war camp in northern Korea were deeply moved when they heard this news by the selfless principle of the Korean and Chinese forces, who not only treated the prisoners leniently but also tried to get them home as soon as possible. The US representatives' use of prisoners of war as bargaining chips and their overbearing attitude of endlessly delaying the negotiations caused widespread dissatisfaction and resentment among prisoners of war from the US and Britain. An American prisoner who did not want to give his name said: "The Koreans and Chinese hope and do everything possible to ensure that the negotiations are successful as soon as possible and are willing to let us return to our homes as soon as possible. But the US representatives deliberately delay the negotiations and do not let us go home soon. This does not surprise me, because the US representatives care not about us, but about the war."
    I saw an article written by an American prisoner on the wall newspaper published by the prisoners, entitled "Why does US Imperialism Want to Delay the Armistice Negotiations?" The lines were filled with resentment. Another American prisoner raised a series of questions in the wall newspaper: "Why does US imperialism let thousands of young people be inexplicably wounded and killed in the war? Why does US imperialism use us as bargaining chips to delay negotiations? Are they afraid of peace and do not want peace? Do they not care at all about us and other American soldiers on the battlefield? I think everyone will definitely answer: Yes!" Another American prisoner, Simon, continued to analyze: "Because our understanding of peace is love and happiness, while the American tycoons' view of peace is that they can no longer obtain huge profits in the war." An American black prisoner also drew a picture of a Wall Street boss wearing fancy clothes and eating delicacies; on the ground next to him was a pile of paper, full of lists of American soldiers killed, wounded, and captured in Korea; outside the window was a street with thousands of people demanding peace. This painting fully reveals his desire for peace and his resentment towards the warmongers.
    Since the Korean armistice negotiations began, the US side has continuously created incidents to delay the armistice negotiations. Van Fleet launched the "Summer Offensive" and the "Autumn Offensive." American planes flew over this remote rear, without any military equipment, prisoner-of-war camp on the evening of October 13 last year and dropped a high-explosive bomb and sixty fragmentation bombs. This series of barbaric acts by the US side made the prisoners more deeply aware that the US military is indeed inhuman. An American prisoner of war, Charles Dick, who was injured by the US plane, said angrily: "I am extremely resentful. I never thought that I would be injured by an American plane in this prisoner-of-war camp far from the battlefield. I cannot find any reason to explain why the US plane should bomb this place with no military equipment." Seven American prisoners wrote a letter together to the family of American prisoner of war Air Force Lieutenant Robert Gorman, who was killed by the US plane. The letter stated: "A few months ago, Gorman was recuperating in the prisoner-of-war camp hospital due to illness. The volunteer army doctor treated his illness completely responsibly. He was excitedly talking about the happiness of returning home in the future, but unfortunately, he was killed by an American plane."
    The prisoners, who are anxiously watching the progress of the armistice negotiations and eagerly hoping to return home soon, now hate and fear most that the US side will use various extraneous methods to delay the armistice negotiations. The prisoners have successively sent many letters and telegrams, appealing to the people of the world for peace and opposing the continued shameless delay of the armistice negotiations by the American imperialists.

### 俘虏的愿望和忿恨

    俘虏的愿望和忿恨
    新华社记者　徐熊
    每一个俘虏都有这样殷切的愿望：“让我们快些回家吧！”但是在朝鲜停战谈判中，美方代表一再玩弄拖延手段，使俘虏们愿望的实现，遥遥无期。
    在朝鲜停战谈判的第四项议程的小组委员会开始时，朝中方面代表就提出了停战后迅速释放与遣送全部战俘的原则。这种完全合理的原则，给俘虏们带来很大的安慰。在朝鲜北部的某俘虏营中的美、英等国俘虏们，听到了这一消息后，深为朝中部队不仅宽待俘虏，而且设法让他们早日回家的无私的原则所感动。而美方代表用战俘作讨价还价的买卖，和无休止地拖延谈判的蛮横态度，则引起美英等国战俘普遍的不满和忿恨。一个不愿宣布姓名的美国俘虏说：“朝鲜人和中国人都希望并尽一切努力争取谈判早日成功，愿意我们早日重回家园。但是美国代表却故意地拖延谈判，不让我们早日回家。这并不使我奇怪，因为美国代表关心的不是我们，而是战争。”
    我在俘虏们办的墙报——“圣诞节特刊”上，看到一个美俘写的文章，标题是“美帝为什么要拖延停战谈判？”字里行间，充满了忿恨的感情。另一个美俘在墙报上提出了一连串的问题：“美帝为什么让千万青年莫名其妙地在战争中伤亡？美帝为什么把我们当作讨价还价的东西来拖延谈判？是不是他们害怕和平而不要和平？是不是他们一点不关心我们和其他在战场上的美国士兵？我想每一个人都会肯定地回答：是的！”另一个美俘西蒙接着分析说：“因为我们对和平的理解是爱情和幸福，而美国大亨们对和平的看法，却是不能再在战争中取得巨大的利润。”一个美俘黑人还在一幅画上画了一个身穿华服的华尔街老板，在吃着山珍海味；一旁的地上有一堆纸，纸上写满着在朝鲜作战的美国士兵被打死、打伤、俘掳的名单；窗外的大街上则是成千上万的要求和平的群众。这幅画充分流露了他对和平的愿望和对战争贩子们的忿恨。
    朝鲜停战谈判以来，美方层出不穷地制造拖延停战谈判的事件。范佛里特发动了“夏季攻势”和“秋季攻势”。美国飞机又在去年十月十三日晚上飞到这个远处后方、毫无军事设备的俘虏营的上空，投下一枚高度爆炸性的炸弹和六十枚杀伤弹。美方这一连串野蛮的行为，使俘虏们更深刻地认识到美军的确是毫无人性的。被美机炸伤的一个美军俘虏查理斯·狄克忿怒地说：“我忿恨极了，在这远离战场的后方俘虏营，想不到我竟被美国飞机炸伤。我找不出任何理由可以说明美机应该轰炸这毫无军事设备的地方。”有七个美俘，共同给被美机炸死的美俘空军少尉罗贝特·格曼的家属写了一封信，信上写道：“几个月前格曼因病在俘虏营医院休养，志愿军医生很负责地把他的病完全治好了。他正在兴奋地谈着将来回家时的快乐，不幸他却被美国飞机炸死了。”
    正在焦急地注视着停战谈判的进展，和十分迫切地盼望早日回家的俘虏们，现在最恨和最怕的就是美方再用种种节外生枝的办法来拖延停战谈判了。俘虏们接连发出很多书信和电报，向全世界人民呼吁和平和反对美国帝国主义者继续无耻地拖延停战谈判。
