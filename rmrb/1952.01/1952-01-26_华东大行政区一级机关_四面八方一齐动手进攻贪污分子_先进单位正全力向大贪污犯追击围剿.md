The first-level organs of the East China Greater Administrative Area are fervently carrying out a confession and denunciation movement against corruption. Certain advanced units have begun to move from general confessions and denunciations to concentrating their forces on tracking down and suppressing major grafters.

Before launching the mass confession and denunciation movement, the first-level organs of the East China Greater Administrative Area invariably adopted the step of having the leading cadres take the lead by thoroughly self-criticizing themselves to the masses and letting the masses conduct democratic reviews in an unconstrained manner. Most organs had successively completed this step between January 15th and 20th. Because this step was conscientiously implemented, the vast majority of responsible cadres underwent the test of democratic review and established a strong and authoritative battle headquarters among the masses; the masses, trained in democratic review, quickly formed a battle force with unity from top to bottom and consistency internally and externally, focusing their efforts on opening fire on corrupt elements. Most staff members of the organs were moved and invigorated after listening to the self-criticism reports of the responsible cadres. Some responsible cadres who did not conduct serious self-criticism at the beginning caused the spearhead of mass struggle to become entangled for a long time in some details of their lifestyle and leadership style, completely trapping themselves in a passive position and unable to lead the movement forward, while corrupt elements were able to hide. These responsible cadres accepted this painful lesson and further made thorough self-criticism reports to the masses, expressing their determination to carry the movement through to the end. Seeing that the leading cadres had unreservedly confessed their problems, the masses united around the leading cadres and launched an offensive against corrupt elements.

When the mass confession and denunciation movement unfolded, the first-level organs of the East China Greater Administrative Area generally invited merchants directly related to their organs to meetings, opening up a battlefield behind the corrupt elements, and thereby promoting the anti-bribery, anti-fraud, anti-profiteering, and anti-tax evasion movements that were unfolding in society. In addition, they further visited and investigated shop assistants, workers, and relatives and friends of those suspected of corruption, which yielded great results. Many organs thus discovered materials that could not be found internally. Many corrupt elements confessed under internal and external pressure.

After establishing a strong and authoritative headquarters, training and organizing a mass combat force, opening up a battlefield with internal and external cooperation, and grasping the enemy's situation, the anti-corruption struggle in the first-level organs of the East China Greater Administrative Area was universally launched. The firepower of the struggle was strong, fiery, and well-organized. Many units adopted methods such as "bombarding in large meetings, attacking in small meetings," "general review, focused investigation," and "individual talks, family visits" to launch a coordinated attack from all sides. The masses put forward the slogan "Don't let a single corrupt element escape," and slogans, wall newspapers, broadcasts, and ballads were all about "Eliminating corruption" and "Calling for confession." It was truly a case of "Everyone shouting 'kill' when a rat crosses the street," and corrupt elements were restless and had nowhere to hide. In this vigorous atmosphere, some organs achieved victories every day and gained something in every battle.

Currently, in the mass confession and denunciation movement in the first-level organs of the East China Greater Administrative Area, the corrupt elements who have confessed and been denounced are generally those who have committed lighter crimes, and major grafters with serious crimes have not yet been completely pursued. However, the responsible cadres of individual organs have an attitude of being satisfied with the number of confessions, thinking that "the movement is almost over." This attitude has been corrected by the leaders of the East China Military and Political Committee's Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee. Some organs with faster movement development, such as the Shanghai Railway Administration, have begun to announce publicly that those who have committed lighter crimes and have confessed thoroughly will be exempt from prosecution on the condition that they admit their mistakes and guarantee that they will never commit them again, in order to dispel the concerns of this group of people and call on them to actively participate in denunciation, so as to expand the battle line of the anti-corruption struggle. Furthermore, the firm determination of the leadership was announced, and the slogans "Pursue and suppress major grafters" and "Fight tigers" were put forward. At the same time, some organs with larger units and unbalanced movement development also put forward the slogan "Eliminate dead corners" and dispatched a part of their forces to drive the units that had not taken action to take action.

In the first-level organs of the East China Greater Administrative Area, there are still individual organs, such as the Ministry of Trade, that remain in the stage of democratic review leadership, mainly because the responsible cadres had a paralyzing and complacent attitude at the beginning of the movement, and the transformation was slow and the review was not thorough, so they have been unable to extricate themselves from the criticism of the masses and cannot lead the movement. Now, after the East China Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee pointed out the key to the problem, it is being corrected. There are also individual organs where the spearhead of mass struggle is scattered and stagnated on some middle-level leading cadres because they have not reviewed themselves well. The East China Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee has pointed out to such organs that the movement should not be stalled because of the problems of individual middle-level leading cadres. These cadres should be ordered to continue to conduct strict reviews and guarantee to the masses that their reviews will be published on wall newspapers or that time will be set aside to explain them to the masses, so as to enable the movement to quickly shift to the pursuit and suppression of corrupt elements.

    华东大行政区一级机关
    四面八方一齐动手进攻贪污分子
    先进单位正全力向大贪污犯追击围剿
    华东大行政区一级机关火热地展开了反对贪污的坦白、检举运动。个别先进的单位已开始从普遍的坦白、检举发展到集中力量向大贪污犯跟踪追剿。
    在展开群众性坦白、检举运动之前，华东大行政区一级机关无例外地采取了首长亲自上阵，领导干部层层带头向群众作彻底自我检讨，并放手发动群众展开民主检查的步骤。这个步骤，大部分机关在一月十五日到二十日之间已先后完成。由于认真实行了这个步骤，绝大部分的负责干部经历了民主检讨的考验，在群众中建立了坚强的、有威信的战斗司令部；在民主检查中受到训练的群众，迅速地组成了上下同心、内外一致的战斗队伍，大家集中力量向贪污分子开火。大部分机关的工作人员听了负责干部的检讨报告后，都很感动振奋。有一些在开始时没有认真自我检讨的负责干部，曾使群众斗争的锋芒长久地纠缠在自己生活作风和领导作风中的一些细节问题上，使自己完全陷于被动，无法领导运动前进，而贪污分子却得到了隐蔽。这些负责干部接受了这个沉痛教训，进一步向群众作了彻底的检讨报告，表明了一定要把运动贯彻到底的决心。群众看到领导干部已无保留地交清了自己的问题，就齐心团结在领导干部的周围，向贪污分子进攻的阵势摆开了。
    在群众性的坦白、检举运动展开时，华东大行政区一级机关普遍邀集与本机关直接有关的商人开会，在贪污分子的背后开辟了战场，并以此推动社会上正在展开的反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动。此外并进一步对店员、职工和对有贪污嫌疑者的亲友走访调查，收到很大效果。许多机关因此发现了在内部不能发现的材料。不少贪污分子在内外压力下纷纷坦白了。
    在建立了坚强的有威信的司令部、训练并组织了群众性的战斗队伍、开辟了内外配合的战场、掌握了敌情之后，华东大行政区一级机关的反贪污斗争就普遍地展开了。斗争的火力是旺盛、炽烈而且是有组织的。许多单位采取了“大会轰、小会攻”，“一般检讨、重点追查”，“个别谈话、家庭访问”等四面八方一齐动手的办法。群众提出了“不给一个贪污分子漏网”的口号，标语、墙报、播音、说唱，都是“肃清贪污”、“号召坦白”，真是“老鼠过街，人人喊打”，贪污分子坐立不安，无处躲藏。在这样雷厉风行的气氛中，有的机关做到了天天打胜仗、仗仗有收获。
    目前华东大行政区一级机关的群众性坦白、检举运动中，坦白、检举出来的贪污分子一般还是一些犯罪较轻的人，罪恶重大的贪污犯尚未完全追出来。但个别机关的负责干部有满足于坦白数字的情绪，认为“运动差不多了”。这种情绪，已为华东军政委员会增产节约委员会领导方面所纠正。一部分运动发展较快的机关如上海铁路管理局等，开始对犯罪较轻、坦白彻底的分子，在承认了错误、保证决不再犯的条件下，当众宣布免予追究，以解除这一批人的顾虑，号召他们积极参加检举，以扩大反贪污斗争的战线。并且进一步宣布了领导方面的坚定决心，提出“追剿大贪污分子”、“打老虎”。同时，有些单位较大、运动发展不平衡的机关，也提出了“消灭死角”的口号，分出一部分力量把没有行动起来的单位带动起来。
    华东大行政区一级机关中，现在也还有个别机关如贸易部，仍停留在民主检查领导的阶段，主要是负责干部在运动开始时就存在着麻痹自满情绪，转变较迟缓，检讨不深刻，因此一直在被群众批评中解脱不开，无法领导运动。现经华东增产节约委员会指出问题的关键后，正在纠正中。也有个别机关，由于有些中层的领导干部没有好好检讨，群众斗争的锋芒分散停留在这些干部身上，华东增产节约委员会已向这种机关指出：不要因为个别中层领导干部的问题，使运动停滞不前，应该责成这些干部继续严格检讨，并向群众保证将他们的检讨在墙报上公布或抽出空隙时间向群众交代清楚，以使运动迅速地转入向贪污分子追击围剿。
