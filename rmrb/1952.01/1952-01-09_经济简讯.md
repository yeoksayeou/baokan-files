	Economic Briefs

	▲ The Northeast Institute of Science, under the instruction of the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government, conducted a specialized investigation and research on foundry sand produced in various parts of Northeast China. It was discovered that the natural silica sand in a certain area consists entirely of quartz particles of suitable size, without impurities. The silica sand itself also contains approximately 11% clay, and the sand particles are mixed very evenly, making it very suitable for the molding of large and medium-sized steel castings. This discovery will play a significant role in reducing casting rejects, improving quality, and lowering costs.

	▲ Tao Jusheng, a technician at the spindle workshop of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, created a new method for straightening quenched spindles. This reduces the breakage of spindles during straightening after quenching, reducing the scrap rate from the original 40% to one in ten thousand. The work efficiency has also increased from straightening 40 spindles per person per day to 80 to 90 spindles. This creation makes a significant contribution to the machinery factory's task of manufacturing a large number of textile machines.

	▲ From January to November of last year, the Logistics Transportation Department of the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army cleared out useful materials worth more than 9.9 billion yuan from waste materials. They also pieced together damaged cars to assemble 120 vehicles.

	▲ From January to November of last year, workers at the Fuzhou Repair Shop of the Fujian Transportation Company used waste materials in their spare time to repair 14 damaged cars, increasing production and saving wealth worth more than 300 million yuan for the country.

	▲ Workers in the shoe and sock group of a certain outfitting factory in Dihua City, Xinjiang Province, saved more than 40 bolts of cloth by using waste materials to make 5,000 pairs of shoes. At the same time, they also improved their work methods, reducing the number of people needed to complete the task originally planned for 80 people in two months to only 50 people, and completed the task four days ahead of schedule.

	▲ In the patriotic production increase movement, workers at the private Qingfeng Yarn Factory in Wuxi City created and improved more than 50 kinds of tools and improved four kinds of work methods, reducing the amount of cotton used per piece of yarn from 411 jin to 406 jin. In this way, Qingfeng Yarn Factory can save more than 2.36 billion yuan per year on cotton alone.

	▲ During the production increase and economy drive, Liu Shuangtai, a worker at the Zhengzhou Works Section of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, wrote a letter to Liu Jianzhang, the director of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, criticizing the huge waste caused by the Zhengzhou Railway Administration's basic construction projects being concentrated in the winter every year. Director Liu Jianzhang immediately accepted this opinion and organized relevant departments to investigate and correct this unreasonable phenomenon left over from before liberation.

	▲ In the past, the Northeast Tax Bureau's complex forms and reports kept cadres busy all day long, resulting in statistics for the sake of statistics, wasting a lot of manpower and materials. After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the bureau's staff actively began to improve the form and report system, simplifying the items in the forms and reports. For example, the planning office reasonably reduced the items in the goods tax plan table from 103 to 28, saving 17,932 work hours and 6,773 sheets of white paper each month. This amount of paper accounts for 74% of the annual paper consumption.

    ▲东北科学研究所根据东北人民政府工业部的指示，对东北各地所产铸造用砂作了专门的调查研究，发现某地天然矽砂全为大小适中的石英颗粒，没有杂质；矽砂本身又含有约百分之十一的黏土，砂粒混合非常均匀，很适合大、中型钢铁铸件造型之用。这项发现对减少铸件废品、提高质量和降低成本都将起很大的作用。
    ▲国营上海第二纺织机械厂锭子工场技工陶菊生，创造了校直淬火锭杆的新操作法，减少了淬火后的锭杆敲直时的断裂现象，使废品率由原来的百分之四十降低到万分之一，工作效率也由过去每人每天校直四十根锭杆提高到八十到九十根。这个创造对机械厂完成大量制造纺织机械的任务贡献很大。
    ▲中国人民解放军西南军区后勤运输部自去年一月到十一月止，从废料中清出了价值九十九亿多元的有用物资。他们又把损坏了的汽车拼凑起来装成了一百二十辆汽车。
    ▲福建运输公司福州修车厂职工从去年一月到十一月，利用废料在工作以外的时间修复了坏汽车十四辆，为国家增产节约了价值三亿多元的财富。
    ▲新疆省迪化市某装具厂鞋袜组工人利用废料，作五千双鞋就节省了四十多匹布。同时，他们还改进了工作方法，使原计划八十个人两个月完成的任务只用了五十个人，并提前四天完成。
    ▲无锡市私营庆丰纱厂职工在爱国增产运动中，创造和改进了五十多种工具，改进了四种工作方法，使每件纱的用棉量从四百十一斤降到四百零六斤。这样，庆丰纱厂仅用棉一项每年就可以节约二十三亿六千多万元。
    ▲郑州铁路管理局郑州工务段工人刘双泰在增产节约运动中写信给郑州铁路管理局局长刘建章，批评郑州铁路管理局的基本建设工程每年都集中到冬季进行所造成的巨大浪费现象。局长刘建章立刻接受了这个意见，并组织有关部门进行检查、纠正这一解放前遗留下来的不合理现象。
    ▲东北税务管理局过去由于表报复杂，干部整天忙忙碌碌，形成为统计而统计，浪费大量人力和物力。在反贪污浪费、反官僚主义运动开展后，该局工作人员就积极着手改进表报制度，简化表报品目。如计划室合理地把货物税计划表的品目由一百零三种减少到二十八种，每月可节省一万七千九百三十二个工时，六千七百七十三张白报纸，这项纸张占全年用纸的百分之七十四。
