    Southern Jiangsu Electric Power Bureau Adjusts Power Load
    Equipment Utilization Rate Continuously Improves
    Saving Over 6 Billion Yuan in Fixed Assets
    Last year, the Southern Jiangsu Electric Power Bureau continuously adjusted the power load and increased the power factor (the ratio of active power to reactive power), increasing the equipment utilization rate from 53% in January to 66.06% in November, exceeding the new record set by the Shanghai Electric Power Industry in the same month.
    In the past, the power load of the Southern Jiangsu Electric Power Bureau was very unbalanced, with the lowest load only 50% of the highest load, and the Sunday load was 45% lower than usual, so the equipment capacity could not be fully utilized. In July last year, the Southern Jiangsu Electric Power Bureau, based on the improving situation of industry and commerce, decided to adjust the electricity consumption time of factories in Wuxi, Changzhou, Danyang and other cities. Starting in August, industries such as cotton spinning, dyeing and weaving, and flour milling in Wuxi and Changzhou successively implemented a rotational holiday system. Starting in September, sawmill factories, rice mills, and the Changzhou Weaving Factory, which operated 20 hours a day, also changed their production times, staggering the factory's electricity consumption time with the city's lighting electricity consumption time. As a result, the Sunday power generation of the Southern Jiangsu Electric Power Bureau increased by one time compared to the past; the daily minimum load also increased by 25%, and 1.2 million more kilowatt-hours of electricity could be generated each month, which is equivalent to increasing 2,000 kilowatts of power equipment. At the same time, the Southern Jiangsu Electric Power Bureau also helped the No. 1 and No. 3 factories of the Changzhou Dacheng Textile Factory to modify the old generators into synchronous phase adjusters, reducing the reactive power of the power plant, which is equivalent to increasing the power generation capacity of the power bureau by 500 kilowatts. After these two improvements, the Southern Jiangsu Electric Power Bureau increased its power generation capacity by a total of 2,500 kilowatts, saving the country about 6 billion yuan in fixed assets.

    苏南电业局调整电力负荷
    设备利用率不断提高
    节省固定资金六十多亿元
    苏南电业局去年不断调整电力负荷和提高力率
    （有功电力和无功电力的比），使设备利用率由一月份的百分之五十三提高到十一月份的百分之六十六点零六，超过了上海市电力工业同月所创的新纪录。
    苏南电业局过去电力负荷很不平衡，最低时只有最高时的百分之五十，星期日的负荷又较平时低百分之四十五，因此设备能力不能充分发挥。去年七月，苏南电业局根据工商业日趋好转的情况，决定调整无锡、常州、丹阳等城市的工厂用电时间。八月份起，无锡、常州两地的棉纺、染织、面粉等业先后实行了轮流休假办法。九月份起，一班制的锯木厂、米厂和常州市日夜开工二十小时的织布厂等，也都改变了生产时间，使工厂生产用电时间和城市照明用电时间错开。结果，苏南电业局星期日的发电量较前增加一倍；每日的最低负荷也提高了百分之二十五，每月可多发一百二十万度电，等于增加了二千瓩的电力设备。同时，苏南电业局又帮助常州市大成纺织厂第一、第三两厂，把废旧的发电机改装成同期调相机，减少了电厂的无功电力，因而又等于使电业局增加了五百瓩的发电能力。经过这两项改进后，苏南电业局共计增加了二千五百瓩的发电能力，为国家节省了约六十余亿元的固定资金。（新华社）
