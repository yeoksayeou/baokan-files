    The Tunisian People's Anti-Imperialist Struggle
    At a time when the Egyptian and Moroccan people's struggle against imperialist aggression is deepening, the people of another oppressed country in North Africa—Tunisia—have also launched a staunch struggle to resist the French imperialist bloody suppression and strive for national independence and liberation. Tunisian workers and the broad masses of patriots launched an indefinite national general strike on the 18th of this month.
    Tunisia is a French imperialist colony in North Africa. For more than seventy years, the colonial rule of French imperialism over Tunisia has completely deprived the Tunisian people of their national independence and freedom, and they have long lived a humiliating and powerless life of enslavement. Tunisia's rich agricultural products and mineral resources have been arbitrarily plundered by greedy imperialists, while the Tunisian people have been trapped in the miserable situation of not having enough to eat, not having enough clothes to wear, and suffering from disease and death. During the Second World War, American imperialism took the opportunity to seize Tunisia's important ports and airports, and Tunisia became an aggressive base for American imperialism on the Mediterranean coast.
    However, the Tunisian people are unwilling to live under the oppression of imperialism for a long time. For many years, they have been fighting tirelessly to break free from the shackles of slavery imposed on them by imperialism. The recent upsurge in the national liberation movements of the people in the Middle East and North Africa has further stimulated their fighting will.
    The development of the Tunisian people's struggle for national independence and autonomy demonstrates the improvement of the Tunisian people's national consciousness and the growth of their fighting strength. French imperialism has adopted a frenzied and bloody suppression of the Tunisian people and the people in Morocco and other places who demand independence and liberation. This shows the barbarity and brutality of imperialism, but it also shows that imperialist colonial rule in this region has reached a fragile point where it cannot be maintained without bloody means.
    Peace-loving people all over the world stand on the side of the Tunisian and North African people; no matter how barbaric and brutal imperialism is, the Tunisian and North African people will surely be able to break through the many obstacles and traps laid down by imperialism with bayonets and divisive conspiracies, and achieve national independence and liberation.

### 突尼斯人民的反帝国主义斗争

    突尼斯人民的反帝国主义斗争
    在埃及和摩洛哥人民反对帝国主义侵略的斗争日益深入发展的时候，位于非洲北部的另一个被压迫国家——突尼斯的人民，为了反抗法帝国主义的血腥镇压，争取民族独立和解放，也展开了坚强的斗争。突尼斯的工人与广大爱国者，已于本月十八日举行了无限期的全国总罢工。
    突尼斯是法帝国主义在北非的一个殖民地。七十多年来法帝国主义对突尼斯所实行的殖民统治，使突尼斯人民完全丧失了民族的独立与自由，长期地过着屈辱无权的被奴役的生活。突尼斯的丰富的农产品与矿藏，被贪婪的帝国主义者任意掠夺，而突尼斯人民则一直陷于食不饱腹，衣不蔽体与遭受疾病和死亡的悲惨情形之中。在第二次世界大战期间，美帝国主义乘机侵占了突尼斯的重要港口与机场，于是突尼斯又沦为美帝国主义在地中海畔的一个侵略基地。
    但是，突尼斯人民决不愿意长远地在帝国主义的压迫之下生活下去，许多年来，他们就为着挣脱帝国主义所强加在他们身上的奴隶枷锁而进行了不懈的斗争，最近中东与北非人民争取民族解放运动的高涨，更加激励了他们的斗争意志。
    突尼斯人民争取民族独立自主斗争的开展，表现了突尼斯人民的民族觉悟的提高和斗争力量的增长。法帝国主义对突尼斯人民与摩洛哥等地人民要求独立解放的斗争，采取了疯狂的血腥的镇压。这表现了帝国主义的野蛮和残暴，但也说明了帝国主义在这个地区的殖民统治已经到了非用血腥手段就根本不能维持下去的脆弱地步了。
    全世界爱好和平人民都是站在突尼斯及北非人民的一边的；不管帝国主义是如何的野蛮和残暴，突尼斯和北非人民一定能够冲破帝国主义用刺刀和分裂阴谋所布置下的重重障碍与陷阱，而取得民族的独立和解放。
