The Southwest District Company and Chongqing City Company of the China National Grain Corporation jointly held a confession and report-corruption conference at the end of last year. While the meeting was in progress, a worker from a private rice mill rushed in, requesting to report corrupt elements at the meeting. Amidst enthusiastic applause from the masses, this worker walked to the front of the stage and spoke. He angrily pointed to a staff member named Chen Mingde, who was present, and said, "He colluded with our boss to steal and sell 8,000 catties of national rice. Today I want to report him." Then he recounted Chen Mingde's corruption case in detail. Everyone at the meeting was moved. After he finished his report, five or six other people reported several corrupt elements who stubbornly refused to confess and repent.

This worker's name is Li Taiyun, and he works at the Yifeng Rice Mill, a private enterprise in Chongqing City. He said: "Before liberation, when the Kuomintang was in power, everyone knew that no official was not corrupt. When we were first liberated, I didn't understand anything. At that time, the Grain Corporation entrusted our factory with processing a batch of paddy rice, and they sent a resident factory representative, who was Chen Mingde. Our boss, Zhang Yaoguang, invited him to play cards and dine every day, and eventually won him over. They colluded to steal and sell the processed rice. At that time, in order to silence us, they even gave four workers in our factory tens of thousands of yuan each, telling us not to tell anyone about it. At that time, I was still very confused and didn't think there was anything wrong. Later, I joined the trade union, and after more than a year of study and my own personal experience, I realized that it is the responsibility of every worker to protect state property. Therefore, thinking back to that incident, I am very sad. I hate these unscrupulous merchants and corrupt elements. But at this time, I still didn't know what to do."

He went on to describe the process of this report. A few days ago, the Grain Corporation sent people to their factory to investigate. The investigators found a cook in the factory named Ren Minxin. Ren Minxin was afraid of losing his job if he told the truth, so he dared not reveal the details. After the investigators left, Ren Minxin and Li Taiyun discussed it. Li Taiyun thought it over and over again: Who brought the happy days of my liberation? Isn't the People's Government busy building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and building factories to make people's lives better in the future? Those corrupt elements are digging holes everywhere and sabotaging, I am a worker, if I see corruption and don't report it, how can I be worthy of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party? He made up his mind, persuaded Ren Minxin, and decided to jointly report the matter when the Grain Corporation sent people to investigate again. But the boss heard that they were going to report, and quickly ran to stop them. The boss said, "Don't meddle in other people's business, a few dollars don't matter! If you don't say anything, no one will know." Li Taiyun replied to the boss, "You stole the people's hard-earned money and put it in your own pockets, and you still haven't confessed to the People's Government. If we don't report you, who will? This is not meddling in other people's business, this is our own business. If you don't confess, we will report you."

Li Taiyun is just learning to read and write and cannot write a report letter. He heard that the Grain Corporation was holding a conference, so he rushed to report. The day after Li Taiyun's report, his boss had no choice but to confess to the Grain Corporation his crime of inducing staff members to commit corruption.

    检举贪污是大家的事
    新华社记者  刘宗棠
    中国粮食公司西南区公司和重庆市公司在去年年底联合举行了一个坦白和检举贪污大会。会议正在进行时，从外面赶来一个私营米厂的工人，他要求到会上检举贪污分子。在群众热烈欢迎下，这位工人走到台前发言。他愤怒地用手指着当时在座的一个名叫陈明德的职员说：“就是他和我们老板勾结偷卖国家八千斤大米，今天我要检举他。”接着他原原本本地把陈明德的贪污案件讲了出来。参加会议的人都受了感动。在他报告完毕后，接着就有五、六个人检举了几个坚不坦白悔过的贪污分子。
    这个工人名叫李泰运，在重庆市私营益丰米厂做工。他说：“解放前国民党在的时候，谁都知道无官不贪。刚解放时，我什么都不懂。那时粮食公司有一批稻谷委托我们厂加工，派了个驻厂员就是陈明德。我们老板张耀光整天约他打牌、吃饭，最后把他哄住了。他们勾结起来偷卖加工的大米。当时他们为了堵我们的嘴，还分给我们厂里四个工人每人几万元，叫我们不要向外面讲。我那时还很糊涂，并不觉得有啥不对。随后，我参加了工会，经过一年多学习和自己的亲身领受，才理解到爱护国家财产是每一个工人的责任。因此回想到那件事情，我很难过。我恨这些奸商和贪污分子。可是这时候还不知道该怎样办好。”
    他接着叙述了这次检举的过程。前几天，粮食公司曾派人到他们的厂里去调查。调查员找到厂里一个做饭的工人任民新。任民新怕说出来丢掉工作，没敢说出详情。调查员走后，任民新和李泰运商量，李泰运反复思量：自己翻身的幸福日子是谁带来的？人民政府整天忙着修成渝铁路、盖工厂，还不是为了使人民将来过更好的日子吗？那些贪污分子却到处掘洞破坏，自己是个工人，看见贪污事情不讲，对得起毛主席、共产党吗？他下了决心，说服了任民新，决定等粮食公司再派人来调查时共同检举这件事情。但老板听说他们要检举，赶忙跑来阻止他们。老板说：“你们不要多管闲事，少数几个钱算了罢！你们不说，没人知道。”李泰运回答老板说：“你们偷了人民的血汗钱装进自己腰包，到今天还不向人民政府坦白。我们不检举你们，等谁来检举？这不是管闲事，这是自己的事。你们不坦白，我们就检举你们。”
    李泰运才在学识字，不会写检举信。他听说粮食公司开大会，就赶来检举。在李泰运检举过后第二天，他的老板也不得不向粮食公司坦白了自己勾引工作人员贪污的罪行。
