    An Example of Relying on Political Leadership Techniques
    Comrade Wang Shitai of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau Goes Deep into the Lower Levels, Relies on the Masses, and Proposes a Plan to Complete the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway Half a Year Ahead of Schedule and Save 200 Billion Yuan

    The Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau's plan to complete the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway's opening to traffic half a year ahead of schedule is a major event in the current increase production and practice economy movement. This is an example of leading cadres going deep into the lower levels, relying on the masses, studying professional work, and doing a good job. Leading cadres at all levels should learn from this example.

    The Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway began construction in May 1950 under the direction of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau. The initial construction situation was very poor: many plans were unrealistic, and the waste of construction time and funds was very serious. For example, the degree of completion of the engineering plans for the eight months of 1950 and January to May of last year was less than one-third. In the engineering work of the entire line from January to May of last year, one-third had no design drawings, and one-half had no construction budget. The reason for this phenomenon was that the original leading cadres of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau had serious bureaucratic work styles, lacked the viewpoint of relying on the working class, blindly believed in certain irresponsible technical engineering personnel, and handed over important projects to contractors. The working masses were demoralized under the contractors' cruel exploitation; the contractors cut corners, resulting in poor project quality. This caused great losses to state assets and hindered the progress of the project.

    Last spring, in order to strengthen its leadership over this engineering bureau, the Northwest Military and Political Committee sent Wang Shitai (member of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China), Deputy Chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, to serve as the Director of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau. After Wang Shitai took office, the above-mentioned phenomenon began to change. Wang Shitai adopted a humble attitude of learning, relied on the working masses, united technical personnel, went deep into the front lines, understood the actual situation of the work and the project, re-examined the annual plan for 1951, and at the same time launched criticism and self-criticism among responsible cadres at all levels in the bureau, seriously reviewing the shortcomings in past work. Since August of last year, the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau has sent a group of more responsible cadres to go deep into the front lines in rotation to repeatedly inspect key projects. Later, the main responsible cadres of this bureau and engineering experts went to the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway line to conduct detailed inspections of key projects everywhere. As a result, they found that several of the most important key projects originally thought to be hindering traffic could be completed ahead of schedule. For example, a large tunnel, originally planned to be completed by the end of 1952 at a cost of more than 90 billion yuan, has been determined by the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau, after inspection and verification, that the construction period can be shortened by half a year and the cost can be reduced by more than 40 billion yuan. There are more than 50 gullies along the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway line that are 20 to 30 meters deep. Because of the lack of steel beams and steel frames, everyone used to think this was the biggest obstacle to traffic. After repeated research by Wang Shitai and other engineering personnel and the working masses, it has now been determined that except for four places where bridges need to be built, the rest can be solved by filling with soil. In this way, the cost will be saved by about 200 billion yuan compared with the original plan. The construction cost of the entire road has been reduced by more than one-half.

    While conducting in-depth research and reviewing the engineering plan, the enthusiasm of the working masses was initially mobilized, and the feudal contractor system was abolished. In the past, under the feudal contractor system, workers were subjected to cruel exploitation. Some contractors even forced workers to work 16 hours a day without paying wages. Many workers were unable to work due to poverty and illness and had to beg for food and return home. Therefore, the enthusiasm for production was generally low. After the leadership discovered this problem, in June of last year, they mobilized the working masses to conduct reasonable struggles against the contractors, expose the contractors' crimes, settle accounts, thoroughly abolish the feudal exploitation system, change the contractor system to self-managed engineering teams, retain all general managers, and deal with managers and bosses according to the severity of their crimes. This enabled the workers' enthusiasm to be brought into play. Now, the work efficiency of the engineering teams has increased by an average of 30 percent per person per day compared with before, and the quality of work has also been significantly improved. Two tunnels that were previously considered difficult have been successfully completed on schedule.

    In order to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of technical engineering personnel, the leadership of the Engineering Bureau also conducted education among technical engineering personnel through many specific examples, criticizing the incorrect thoughts and work styles of many technical engineering personnel who despised the working masses and held purely technical viewpoints, failed to go deep into the front lines, were arrogant, and did not admire each other, gradually raising their political awareness. For example, the Baoji-Tianshui section is the main route for material transportation on the entire line, but the No. 96 tunnel in the Baoji-Tianshui section has collapsed seven times. When the workers raised their opinions and the leadership pointed out that it should be lined, the engineer in charge of this work area did not seize the time to do it, resulting in a serious accident of a major collapse on March 4 last year. During the rescue, the workers proposed using the method of driving steel bars into the tunnel and then excavating the slag, but it was not adopted by the chief engineer who was guiding the rescue work at the time. Instead, the method of opening the patio, which was not suitable for the local soil quality, was adopted, resulting in the patio becoming worse and worse. Finally, the tunnel was repaired using the method proposed by the workers, but the supply of materials was interrupted for more than three months as a result. The leadership used this example to conduct universal education among technical engineering personnel, which achieved good results and laid the foundation for continuing to unite, educate, and transform technical engineering personnel in the future.

    The completion of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway construction project half a year ahead of schedule is of great significance to China's national defense construction and the economic construction of the whole country and the Northwest. For this reason, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Northwest Military and Political Committee sent a telegram of congratulations and appreciation to all employees of the bureau.

    Now, the leadership is actively trying to solve the difficulties of winter operations for tens of thousands of employees, taking into account the steep terrain and the sub-zero 15-degree cold weather along the Tianshui-Lanzhou line, and continuing to pay close attention to inspecting key projects, so that the progress of the project is not affected by any difficulties. All employees are also enthusiastically launching an patriotic labor emulation campaign to increase production and practice economy in response to Chairman Mao's call, and are fighting to complete the new engineering plan on schedule.

    Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, pointed out to cadres at all levels in the Northwest at a cadre meeting held on December 7 last year that the experience of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau, in general, is to rely on politics to lead technology. He pointed out that the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway was originally scheduled to be built to Lanzhou in 1953, but after Wang Shitai and other main responsible cadres of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau grasped the key points, conducted in-depth inspections, personally explored, and enlightened the consciousness of employees, they solved many problems that technical personnel thought could not be solved, and proposed a plan to strive to open to traffic to Lanzhou in 1952. Xi Zhongxun pointed out that Wang Shitai is not an expert or an engineer, but he has mastered Marxism-Leninism and has correct thinking and work style, so he can lead technology and do a good job in capital construction. Therefore, Comrade Xi Zhongxun called on cadres at all levels in the Northwest region to learn from the example of the main responsible cadres of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau in going deep into the lower levels, relying on the masses, and studying professional work.

    依靠政治领导技术的一个范例
    西北铁路干线工程局王世泰同志深入下层依靠群众提出天兰铁路提前半年完工并节省两千亿元的计划
    西北铁路干线工程局计划提前半年完成天水兰州铁路的通车计划，是当前增产节约运动中的一个重大事件。这是领导干部深入下层、依靠群众、钻研业务、做好工作的一个范例。各级领导干部应当学习这个榜样。
    天兰铁路在一九五○年五月在西北铁路干线工程局主持下开工，最初一个时期的施工情况很不好：许多计划不切实际，浪费工程时日和经费的现象非常严重。如一九五○年八个月和去年一月到五月的工程计划，完成的程度都不到三分之一。全线去年一月到五月的工程中，有三分之一没有设计图样，有二分之一没有施工预算。这种现象产生的原因，是西北铁路干线工程局原来的领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，缺乏依靠工人阶级的观点，盲目相信某些不够负责的技术工程人员，并把重要工程交给包商办理。工人群众在包商的残酷剥削下，工作情绪低落；包商偷工减料，使工程质量很坏。这使国家资财遭到很大损失，并妨碍了工程的进展。
    去年春天，西北军政委员会为了加强对这个工程局的领导，派甘肃省人民政府副主席王世泰（中共中央西北局委员）担任西北铁路干线工程局局长职务以后，上述现象才开始有了转变。王世泰等到职后，采取虚心学习的态度，依靠工人群众，团结技术人员，深入现场，了解工作和工程的实际情况，重新审查了一九五一年的年度计划，同时在局内各级负责干部中展开批评和自我批评，严肃地检讨了过去工作中的缺点。从去年八月份起，西北铁路干线工程局就派出一批较负责的干部，轮流深入现场，反复地检查关键工程。以后，这个局主要负责干部又和工程专家一起，到天兰路沿线详细地考察各处关键工程，结果发现原来认为阻碍通车的几处最重要的关键工程，都是可以提前完工的。如某处大隧道，原计划一九五二年年底才能修好，费用需九百多亿元，经检查核算以后，西北铁路干线工程局已确定工期可缩短半年，费用可减少四百多亿元。天兰路沿线共有五十多处二十公尺到三十多公尺深的沟。因为缺少钢梁、钢架，过去大家认为这是通车最大的障碍。经过王世泰等人和工程人员、工人群众反复研究，现在确定除四处需要修桥外，其余都可采用填土的办法来解决。这样，就较原订计划节省费用约两千亿元。全路的修建费，减缩了二分之一以上。
    在深入研究和审查工程计划的同时，并初步发动了工人群众的积极性，废除了封建包商制度。工人过去在封建包商制度下，受到残酷的剥削，有的包商竟强迫工人每天做活十六小时，还不发工资。很多工人因贫病无法工作，只得讨饭回家，因此生产情绪普遍低落。领导方面发现这个问题后，就在去年六月间发动工人群众对包商进行说理斗争，揭露包商罪恶，清算账目，彻底废除封建剥削制度，改包商制为自办工程队，对一般管理人员，一律留用；对经理老板，按罪恶大小，分别予以处理。这就使全路工人的积极性得以发挥。现在，工程队的工作效率平均每人每天较前提高了百分之三十，工作质量也有显著提高，从前认为比较困难的两处隧道都已按期顺利完工。
    为加强对于技术工程人员的政治思想领导。工程局领导方面并通过许多具体事例在技术工程人员中进行教育，批判了许多技术工程人员轻视工人群众和单纯技术观点、不能深入现场、自高自大、互相不佩服等不正确的思想和作风，逐渐地提高了他们的政治认识。如宝（鸡）天（水）段是全路材料运输的要道，但宝天段九十六号隧道却先后坍方过七次，工人们提意见和领导方面指出要衬砌时，负责这个工区的工程师却不抓紧时间去做，造成去年三月四日大坍方的严重事故。在抢修中，工人们又提出采用打钢筋进洞然后掏石碴的办法，但没有被当时指导抢修工程的总工程师采纳，却采用了不适合当地土质的开天井的办法进行，结果愈开愈坏，最后还是采用了工人们提出的方法把隧道修好了，但材料供给却因此断运了三个多月。领导方面就运用这个事例，在技术工程人员中普遍进行教育，收到了很好的效果，为今后继续团结、教育和改造技术工程人员打下了基础。
    天兰铁路兴修工程如提前半年完成，对于我国国防建设及全国和西北的经济建设都有很大意义。为此，西北军政委员会第四次全体会议，特向该局全体职工致电祝贺与慰勉。
    现在领导方面正根据天兰沿线地势险峻和零下十五度的天寒情况，积极设法为数万员工解决冬季作业的困难，继续抓紧检查关键工程，使工程进度不受任何困难影响。全体员工也为了响应毛主席的号召，热烈地展开了增产节约爱国竞赛运动，为按期完成新的工程计划而斗争。
    西北军政委员会副主席习仲勋在去年十二月七日举行的一次干部会议上曾向西北各级干部指出：西北铁路干线工程局的经验，总的说来，就是依靠政治来领导技术。他指出天兰铁路本来预定一九五三年才能修到兰州，但经过西北铁路干线工程局王世泰等主要负责干部掌握重点，深入检查，亲自摸索，启发职工觉悟，结果就解决了许多技术人员认为没有办法解决的问题，提出了争取一九五二年通车到兰州的计划。习仲勋指出，王世泰并不是专家或工程师，但他掌握了马克思列宁主义，有了正确的思想、作风，就可以领导技术，做好基本建设工作。因此，习仲勋同志号召西北地区各级干部学习西北铁路干线工程局主要负责干部深入下层，依靠群众，钻研业务的榜样。　　（群众日报）
