Chongqing University Begins to Inspect Wasteful Practices

To the Editor: The leadership of Chongqing University suffers from serious bureaucratic work style, and some staff members lack the spirit of cherishing public property, resulting in serious waste. The Shaci Affiliated Hospital of the Medical College has wasted 500 million yuan of people's property in the past two years. Many medicines have expired. "Mapharsen" alone (used to treat syphilis and could have treated 1,500 people) suffered a loss of 140 million yuan; more than 10,000 moldy cod liver oil pills (enough to treat 400 patients lacking Vitamin A); more than 30,000 moldy cotton pads (enough for the hospital to use for six years); and more than 140 broken thermometers. Waste in experimentation and manpower is also serious. The ratio of staff to students is 2.8 to 8 (the ratio of staff to students in some new-type universities in China is 1 to 20). These wastes are beginning to be corrected after inspection. I hope that the teachers of Chongqing University will run education with revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods in the future, save unnecessary expenses, and cultivate more talents for the motherland on the basis of existing manpower and material resources.

    重庆大学开始检查浪费现象
    编辑同志：重庆大学的领导方面存在着严重的官僚主义作风，某些工作人员又缺乏爱护公共财物的精神，因此，造成严重的浪费现象。医学院沙磁附属医院两年来浪费了人民财产五亿元。许多药品失效了。只“马法生”（治梅毒用，可救治一千五百人）一项，就损失了一亿四千万元；霉烂的鱼肝油精丸有一万多粒（可救治缺乏维他命A的病人四百人）；霉烂的棉垫达三万多块（可供该院使用六年）；损坏体温计一百四十多支。在实验上，人力上的浪费现象也很严重。工作人员和学生人数的比例为二·八比八（国内某些新型大学的工作人员和学生人数的比例为一比二十）。这些浪费，经过检查，开始被纠正了。我希望重庆大学的教师们今后以革命精神和革命办法来办教育，节省不必要的开支，在现有的人力和物力基础上为祖国培养更多的人才。　重庆大学学生　刘均怀
