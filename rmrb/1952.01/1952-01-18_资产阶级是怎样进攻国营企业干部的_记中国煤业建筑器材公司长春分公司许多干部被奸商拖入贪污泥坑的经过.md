The China Coal Industry Construction Material Company Changchun Branch was established in October 1948, just after Changchun was liberated. It is an agency that sells state-owned coal and construction materials on commission, with three business departments and four business offices, and has established 61 sales offices with private merchants.

Since the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, more than 100 problems have been discovered among 37 staff members of the company. According to preliminary and extremely incomplete statistics, this has caused a loss of more than 520 million RMB to the state. All 37 people colluded with unscrupulous merchants; as for smoking private merchants’ cigarettes, eating their food, and borrowing money from them, almost everyone in the company did this.

**Unscrupulous Merchants Use Various Despicable Means to Entice Cadres**

The methods used by unscrupulous merchants to entice and collude with cadres are varied. Initially, they use small favors to achieve familiarity, and then gradually go deeper. In the early stages of establishing sales relationships between private merchants and the company, they would prepare good cigarettes, peanuts, and melon seeds and scatter them on the table whenever they came to the company, so everyone could smoke and eat. Gradually, after the unscrupulous merchants understood the situation of everyone in the company, they adopted different approaches based on each person's different preferences and requirements. For example, with regard to Manager Cheng of the company (an old cadre), they first used revolutionary principles to confuse him, gained his trust, and then invited him to restaurants for dinner, and then resorted to bribery. Wang An'yu, the head of the planning section of the company, was young and wanted to find a spouse, so the unscrupulous merchant Hu Juncao said to Wang:

"Brother! At this age, after three or four years of revolution, you still don't have a spouse?" Then he said in a vile manner: how beautiful a certain girl was, how good she was, "Brother will introduce you." Wu Tingchen, a staff member of the company, suffered from chronic bronchitis. Once, the unscrupulous merchant Ai Jinghua saw Wu coughing and asked him:

"Your illness is so serious, why don't you treat it? Probably because you don't have money to treat it, right? Earning just a hundred-odd points a month, how can you afford it?" He then took out a wad of money from his pocket and handed it to Wu: "Here! Take it to treat your illness first. Can you not treat your illness? Brother will find you some medicine later." Once, when Wu was seriously ill in bed, Ai personally brought the medicine to Wu's dormitory. Once, this unscrupulous merchant saw Li Guoquan, a staff member of the company, wearing a pair of tattered cotton shoes, and said to Li, "Aren't you cold wearing such shoes? Earning just a hundred-odd points, probably don't have money to buy them, right? Don't be polite, brother, just say so when you need something, and come to my house to get it. Can you not make friends when doing things in society? Money is not for one person to spend." The unscrupulous merchant Hu Juncao knew that Wu Tingchen's family lived in Jilin, so once when he went to Jilin, he specifically went to Wu's house and gave Wu's mother 1 million Northeast currency.

Using the above methods, the unscrupulous merchants made the degenerate elements trust them. When they heard the degenerate elements say things like "You're really a good friend," they knew that these people had been hooked, and then openly wooed them: "Brother, when there's an opportunity in the company, tell brother." "Do you need money?" "What's so difficult about spending money!" "Dare you do it or not?" "If you use your brain, won't you have money to spend?" In this way, all the company's measures and all the things to be sold could not escape the clutches of the unscrupulous merchants.

**Unscrupulous Merchants Collude with Degenerate Elements to Engage in Collective Corruption and Steal State Assets**

(1) Unscrupulous Merchants and Degenerate Elements Conspire to Open Sales Offices

In 1949, in order to expand coal sales, the company planned to find local people in Gongzhuling, Dehui, and other places to set up sales offices. Guan Fengdi, an internal degenerate element, told the unscrupulous merchant Hu Juncao this news: "Big brother! This is an opportunity, please find someone." After the unscrupulous merchant found someone, he and the degenerate elements in the company took the train to Gongzhuling together, planning the scheme along the way. After arriving in Gongzhuling, they posted a fake notice of "Establishing a Sales Office" and established a sales relationship with the company. The degenerate element Guan Fengdi invested 5 million in the name of his wife, Zhao Hongwen. In addition, the unscrupulous merchant also gave another degenerate element a "hero's share" (becoming a shareholder without contributing money), so they started doing business together. When settling accounts eight months later, the three degenerate elements divided up more than 100 million Northeast currency. As for how much profit the unscrupulous merchants made and how much the state actually lost, it is impossible to calculate.

(2) Unscrupulous Merchants Conspire to Force the Company to Lower Prices, Obtaining Huge Illegal Profits

In October 1950, there was a severe shortage of cement in Changchun. The provincial company sent a telegram to the Changchun city company, planning to allocate five train cars of cement to Changchun. This news was also leaked to the unscrupulous merchants by degenerate elements. When the cement arrived in Changchun on the 19th, the unscrupulous merchants came to the company to snap up the cement. Internal degenerate elements surrounded the manager: "We have already asked the public construction companies, and they don't want it." (In fact, they never asked) As a result, all five train cars of cement were bought by the unscrupulous merchants. Fearing loopholes afterward, the degenerate element Wu Tingchen issued fake invoices to the unscrupulous merchants. After the unscrupulous merchants bought the cement, they sold it to the public at twice the listed price, causing the state to lose more than 1.1 billion Northeast currency. The unscrupulous merchants distributed 5 million Northeast currency to the three degenerate elements in the company.

Once, the company transported 400 cubic meters of wood (13 train cars). In order to recover currency, they were eager to sell it in batches, setting the price at 3 million per cubic meter. The eight major private lumber factories in Changchun held a meeting to discuss:

"We understand those people in the Coal Construction Company; if we don't buy it, they won't be able to sell it. Let's wait for them to reduce the price and then buy it." Later, when the company reduced the price of the wood to 2.5 million per cubic meter, Jiancheng Lumber Factory wanted to buy it, but was attacked by Wang Yongwu, the director of the Lumber Industry Association, who said: "Why aren't you united at all? Let's all get rich together!" As a result, they forced the company to lower the price of wood to 1.37 million per cubic meter and sell it to the eight of them. This caused the state to lose 531.1 million Northeast currency.

(3) Degenerate Elements Expose Prices and Sell Market Information

In a certain month in 1950, the day before a wood price drop, a manager surnamed Sun from the wood sales office submitted wood payments to the company. Li Guoquan, a staff member of the company, said to Sun: "Come to pay tomorrow, the wood price will drop tomorrow." As a result, the state lost 1 million RMB, and Li received 400,000. Another time, the day before a coal price drop, a private merchant called the company and asked: "Is the coal price going to drop?" The company replied: "I don't know." But no private merchant bought coal that day. The next day, after the coal price dropped, the private merchants all came to snap it up. Yet another time, the day before a coal price increase, all the sales offices returned the coal they had borrowed to the company, and no one owed the company coal anymore. Judging from the above, there must be someone inside the company who is selling market information; it is currently under investigation.

(4) Unscrupulous Merchants Exploit Loopholes in the Company's Operations to Get Rich

In the early stages, the relationship between the company and the sales offices was that the company would unconditionally extend credit for coal to the private merchant sales offices without setting a deadline for payment. After the sales offices sold the coal, they would then pay the company and purchase the second batch of coal. The loophole in this process was very large. Private merchants could sell the coal and use state capital for private transactions. For example, the unscrupulous merchant Ai Jinghua used 50 million Northeast currency of state coal funds in October 1950 to buy cement from the company, sold the cement, and then used the 50 million to do two more transactions before returning it to the company. The losses suffered by the state in this way are incalculable. The current relationship is a short-term credit method, extending credit for coal to the private merchant sales offices with a deadline for payment. This method still has loopholes.

Storing coal in private merchant sales offices also has very large loopholes. During the summer when coal consumption is greatly reduced, the company lacks coal yards, so it stores coal in private merchant sales offices. In this way, the sales offices can sell state coal at will and do their own business, which is not easily detected by the company.

Because unscrupulous merchants use various methods to entice and collude with degenerate elements within the company, engage in collective corruption, steal state assets, sell market information, and exploit loopholes to get rich, the unscrupulous merchant Hu Juncao, who used to be a solo operator, has now opened a Zhicheng burlap bag factory with more than 70 people and more than 40 machines. The unscrupulous merchant Ai Jinghua has operated a soap factory and a rice milling factory, and is now equipping an electric sawmill factory, which is about to start operations. Hao Xizhen, a bill clerk at a transport company (who used to be a cart driver), colluded with company personnel and openly said to coal buyers when driving carts to transport coal: "Give me money, and I'll haul good coal for you." Now he has grown from one horse-drawn cart to three. During the anti-corruption movement, he requested to resign and go home to drive carts. Zhao Zhenheng, a company staff member who colluded with Hao, has fled.

**Unscrupulous Merchants and Degenerate Elements Collude to Sabotage the Anti-Corruption Movement**

When the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began, unscrupulous merchants and degenerate elements colluded to resist and sabotage the movement. Some unscrupulous merchants and degenerate elements held meetings together and agreed: "Don't talk about internal cadres, protect each other's strongholds, no one is allowed to talk about anyone else, whoever is broken through is on their own." Some corrupt elements expressed their attitude to unscrupulous merchants in small restaurants: "I am an old mallet stone, I have been through big mallets, I will definitely not talk." Some unscrupulous merchants used both soft and hard tactics to prevent corrupt elements from confessing. Some corrupt elements asked other private merchants to write letters to the unscrupulous merchants who colluded with them, discussing how to deal with the company's investigation. Some corrupt elements, because their co-conspirators had been transferred to other jobs, had to communicate to discuss solutions, but fearing that news would leak, they sent private merchants to deliver the messages in person. When the problems of corrupt elements were exposed by others, they united to threaten and attack those who made suggestions: "You can't insult people, you will be fully responsible when the problem is clarified in the future." When the movement entered a climax, their problems had been exposed, and they had no choice but to confess, they would tell the unscrupulous merchants a little bit. When the investigation team went to the unscrupulous merchants to investigate, what was said inside was also said outside, no more and no less. Some corrupt elements used code words on the phone to communicate with unscrupulous merchants while being suspended from work for introspection; fearing that they would be discovered using their real names, they used fake names to talk. Some who were being monitored by the masses inside ran to the toilets to talk. Some used account books to cover up writing notes to pass to each other.

Unscrupulous merchants also used threats and inducements against the comrades who went to investigate. For example, the unscrupulous merchant Hu Juncao said to the comrades of the investigation team: "I bought you two hundred eggs once, I was going to give them to you when you got off work, but I didn't run into you, so I took them back." To another comrade of the investigation team, he said: "I used to think you were very good, and I wanted to introduce you to a spouse; now why are you raising yourself up and attacking others?" They wanted to use these methods to prevent the comrades of the investigation team from conducting a serious investigation.

Currently, Guan Fengdi, Wang An'yu, Wu Tingchen, Wang Luyi, and others who refuse to confess and collude with unscrupulous merchants to sabotage the anti-corruption movement have been sent to the People's Court for legal proceedings. Sun Jie, who refuses to honestly confess his mistakes, has been expelled from the party and removed from his administrative post for investigation. Liu Yizhi, Zheng Lixin, Liang Naitong, and others who confessed themselves and reported others have been exempted from punishment. The unscrupulous merchants who entice cadres will also be subject to due punishment.

    资产阶级是怎样进攻国营企业干部的
    ——记中国煤业建筑器材公司长春分公司许多干部被奸商拖入贪污泥坑的经过
    李正亭
    中国煤业建筑器材公司长春分公司是在一九四八年十月长春刚解放时成立的。它是代销国家煤炭和建筑器材的机关，下设三个营业部，四个营业所，并且和私商建立了六十一个推销处。
    自开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动以来，这个公司的工作人员中，发现有问题的三十七人，问题一百多件；据初步的极不完全的统计，使国家损失人民币五亿二千多万元。这三十七人，都和奸商相勾结；至于吸私商纸烟，吃私商东西，借私商钱，全公司几乎无人不如此。
    奸商用种种卑鄙手段拉拢干部
    奸商拉拢勾结干部的手段是各式各样的。起初以小恩小惠达到熟悉的目的，再步步深入。在私商和公司建立推销关系的初期，每到公司时，预备一些好烟卷、花生和瓜子，往桌上一撒，大家就吸、食起来。奸商渐渐了解公司每个人的情况后，就根据每个人的不同喜好和要求，采取不同方式进攻。如对公司程经理（老干部），先讲革命道理迷惑他，得到信任后，再请他下馆吃饭，进而行贿。公司计划股长王安宇，年轻想找爱人，奸商胡君巢就对王说：
    “兄弟！这大岁数，革命三四年，还没有爱人？”接着就卑鄙地说：某某姑娘如何如何漂亮，怎样怎样好，“哥哥与你介绍。”公司职员吴廷臣常年害气管支炎，奸商艾景华有次见吴咳嗽，就问他：
    “你病这么严重，怎么不治？大概没钱治吧？一个月挣百来分，那能治得起呢？”随即从褂兜里掏出
    一搭钱交给吴：“哪！先拿去治病。有病还能不治吗？以后哥哥再给你找些药。”吴有一次病重卧床，艾就亲自把药送到吴的宿舍。这个奸商有一次见公司职员李果全穿了一双破棉鞋，就对李说：“你穿这样鞋不冷吗？挣百来分，可能没钱买吧？兄弟不要客气，用着时吱声，到我家里去拿。在社会上做事还能不交朋友吗？钱不是一个人化的。”奸商胡君巢知道公司职员吴廷臣家住吉林，有一次去吉林时，特意到吴家给吴的母亲一百万元东北币。
    奸商用以上种种方法，使蜕化分子相信他们。当他们听到蜕化分子说出“真够朋友味”的话时，知道这些人已上了套，就进而进行公开拉拢：“兄弟，公司有机会时，告诉哥哥一下。”“要钱化不？”“用钱费什么难！”“敢干不敢干？”“脑筋动动，不就有钱化了吗？”这样，公司的一切措施和所有要出卖的东西，都逃不出奸商的手掌。
    奸商和蜕化分子勾结起来，进行集体贪污，盗卖国家资财
    （1）奸商和蜕化分子合谋开设推销处
    一九四九年公司为了扩大煤炭销路，打算在公主岭、德惠等地找当地人设立推销处。内部蜕化分子关凤地就把这消息告诉了奸商胡君巢：“大哥！这回有机会，请你找人吧。”奸商把人找好后，就和公司里的蜕化分子同坐火车到公主岭，一路把计谋定好。到公主岭后，贴出“成立推销处”的假布告后，就和公司建立推销关系。蜕化分子关凤地用他妻子赵洪文的名义投入股金五百万。另外奸商还给另一个蜕化分子让了一份“好汉股”（不出钱就作股东），于是就在一起做起了买卖。八个月后结账时，三个蜕化分子就分得一亿多万元东北币。至于奸商得了多少利润，国家究竟损失多少，都无法计算。
    （2）奸商合谋迫使公司压低物价，从中获得巨额非法利润
    一九五○年十月长春水泥奇缺。省公司打电报给长春市公司，打算拨五火车皮水泥给长春。这个消息又被蜕化分子透露给奸商。十九日水泥到长春时，奸商们都到公司来抢购水泥。内部蜕化分子就包围经理：“我们已问过公家的修建公司，他们都不要。”（其实根本没问）于是，五火车皮水泥全叫奸商买去。怕事后出漏洞，蜕化分子吴廷臣给奸商开了假货票。奸商把水泥买到手后，高于牌价一倍卖给公家，使国家损失东北币十一亿元以上。奸商分给公司三个蜕化分子五百万元东北币。
    有一次，公司运到四百立方公尺木材（十三火车皮），为了货币回笼，急于成批卖出，定价三百万元一立方公尺。长春市私营八大木厂就开会商议：
    “煤建公司那些人，我们都了解；咱们不要，他们就卖不出。等他们减价再买。”后来公司把木材价格减到二百五十万元一立方公尺时，建成木厂要买，但遭到木材同业公会主任王永五的打击。说：“你怎么一点不团结？有财大家发！”结果迫使公司把木价压低到一百三十七万元一立方公尺卖给他们八家。这就使国家损失五亿三千一百一十万元东北币。
    （3）蜕化分子暴露物价出卖行情
    一九五○年某月，在一次木材落价的前一天，木材推销处一个姓孙的经理向公司交木材款项。公司职员李果全对孙说：“你明天来交吧，木材明天落价。”结果使国家损失人民币一百万元，李分得四十万元。另一次在煤炭落价的前一天，私商打电话问公司：“煤炭要落价吗？”公司答复：“不知道。”但当天没有一家私商买煤。第二天煤炭落价后，私商都来抢购。又一次在煤涨价的前一天，各推销处把借去的煤炭都还给公司，没有一家再欠公司煤的。从以上事情看，公司内部必定有出卖行情的人；现在正在调查中。
    （4）奸商钻公司营业上的漏洞发大财
    公司和各推销处的关系，初期是先把煤炭无条件赊给私商推销处，不限期收款，待推销处把煤炭卖出后，再向公司缴款，买取第二次煤炭。这中间的漏洞是非常大的。私商可以把煤炭卖出，以国家资本做私人买卖。如奸商艾景华在一九五○年十月以国家煤炭五千万东北币的资金，又买去公司水泥，把水泥卖掉后，又以这五千万元做了两次买卖，才还给公司。这样使国家蒙受的损失是无法计算的。现在的关系是短期赊欠办法，把煤赊给私商推销处，限期交款。这办法仍然有漏洞。
    公司在私商推销处储存煤炭，漏洞也是非常大的。夏季用煤量大减，公司缺乏煤场，就把煤储存在私商推销处。这样，推销处可以随便出卖国家煤炭，做自己的买卖，公司不易发觉。
    由于奸商利用种种办法拉拢和勾结公司内部的蜕化分子，实行集体贪污，盗卖国家资财，出卖行情，钻空子，从中发财，因此，过去单人一个的奸商胡君巢，现在已经开起七十多人的志诚麻袋工厂，有四十多台机器。奸商艾景华曾开过肥皂工厂、制米工厂，现又装备好一个电机锯木工厂，就要开工。搬运公司开票员郝希真（原来是赶马车的），和公司人员有勾结，在赶车拉煤时，公开向买煤主说：“给钱，给你拉好煤。”如今他从一辆马车已发展到三辆，在反贪污运动中要求辞职回家赶车。与郝勾结的公司职员赵振恒已潜逃。
    奸商和蜕化分子勾结起来破坏反贪污运动
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，奸商和蜕化分子勾结起来，抗拒和破坏这个运动。有的奸商和蜕化分子在一起开会约定：“内部干部掉头不谈，各保住各的据点，谁也不准谈谁，攻破谁算谁。”有的贪污分子在小馆里向奸商表示态度：“我是老槌板石，经过大棒槌，一定不谈。”有的奸商以软硬齐下办法阻止贪污分子坦白。有的贪污分子托其他私商写信给和自己合谋贪污的奸商，商量如何对付公司的调查。有的贪污分子，因共同贪污者已调动工作，要通信商量办法，又怕走露消息，派私商亲自送去。贪污分子的问题被别人揭发出来的时候，就联合起来威胁和打击提意见的人：“你不能侮辱人，将来把问题搞清后，你得负完全责任。”当运动进入高潮，他们的问题已被揭发，不坦白不行了，谈一点就告诉奸商一点。调查组到奸商处调查时，内部谈什么，外面也谈什么，一点不多也不少。有的贪污分子被停止工作反省时，就用电话暗号和奸商互通消息；怕用真名被人发觉，就用假名通话。有的在内部被群众监视起来，就跑到便所里去交谈。有的用账本掩盖着写条子互相传递。
    奸商对去调查的同志，也施以威胁利诱手段。如奸商胡君巢对调查组的同志说：“有次我给你买了二百个鸡子，等你下班给你，但没有碰到你，又取回来了。”对另一调查组同志说：“以前我看你很好，想给你介绍个爱人；现在你为什么提高自己打击别人？”他们想用这些办法，使调查组的同志不认真调查。
    现在，拒不坦白并联合奸商破坏反贪污运动的关凤地、王安宇、吴廷臣、王路一等已被送人民法院法办；不肯老实坦白错误的孙捷已被党组织开除党籍，行政方面撤职查办；自己坦白并检举别人的刘宜芝、郑礼信、梁乃桐等免受处罚。勾引干部的奸商，也将受到应有的惩罚。
