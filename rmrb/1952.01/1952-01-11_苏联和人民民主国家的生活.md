    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democracies
    The Soviet Union Prepares to Commemorate the Centenary of Gogol's Death
    The Soviet Union has begun large-scale preparations to commemorate the centenary of the death of the great Russian writer Gogol on March 4th.

    Moscow will hold a memorial meeting and a monument unveiling ceremony. At scientific conferences arranged by the Soviet Academy of Sciences and educational institutions in Moscow, reports on Gogol's creative activities will be presented. In order to publish Gogol's works on the anniversary, the Soviet Academy of Sciences has thoroughly studied approximately 2,400 pages of Gogol's manuscripts housed in the Lenin Library. The new edition will include Gogol's letters, many of which have not yet been published. The Soviet republics will publish new versions of Gogol's works translated into various national languages. More than 7.5 million copies of Gogol's works will be published throughout the Soviet Union on the centenary of his death. Clubs and libraries in cities and villages are organizing exhibitions on Gogol's life and works. The Central Scientific Library in Kharkov has already opened an exhibition of first editions and rare versions. Among the many exhibits is the first complete collection of Gogol's works in four volumes, published in 1842, as well as extremely rare versions of Gogol's works translated into foreign languages. Soviet theaters will stage "The Government Inspector," "Marriage," "Dead Souls" adapted into a play, and "May Night" on the anniversary.
    
    Remarkable Achievements in Korean Literary and Artistic Creation in the Past Year
    The Korean literary and artistic circles have achieved remarkable results in creation in the past year. The literature sector has created 572 works praising heroes in the Liberation War, the fine arts sector has published 1,413 creations, 60 dramas have been performed, 40,690 new artistic photographs have been taken, 63 dance creations have been produced, and 388 songs have been written. These works have played a significant role in inspiring the fighting will of the Korean people, reflecting their heroic struggle, and enhancing the friendship between the Korean people and the people of fraternal countries. Many excellent works have received high praise. For example, the art film "Young Guerrilla Team," which depicts the heroic struggle of Korean children, won the "Struggle for Freedom Award" at last year's international film festival. The program performed by the Korean People's Art Troupe participating in the 3rd World Youth and Students for Peace Festival also won awards.
    
    Achievements of the Romanian Petroleum Industry
    Romania has completed its 1951 petroleum production plan ahead of schedule. Oil production in 1951 increased by 23 percent compared to 1950.

    Petroleum is an important resource of Romania, with reserves ranking fifth in the world. Before World War II, American and British capital controlled 86 percent of Romania's oil production. After liberation, Romania, on the principle of complete equality, formed the SovRom Petroleum Company with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union transported a large amount of machinery and equipment to ensure the recovery of Romania's petroleum industry. Romania's Five-Year Plan stipulates that annual oil production should be increased to 10 million tons by 1955. In 1949, Romania drilled more than twice as many new oil wells as in 1945, and in 1950, it increased more than four times compared to 1949. Due to advances in oil extraction technology, many old abandoned wells have been reactivated, producing 100,000 tons of oil from abandoned wells in 1949 alone.
    
    Warsaw to Build Underground Railway
    The Polish government has issued a decision to build an underground railway in Warsaw. Currently, design and surveying personnel are accelerating preparations. The design work for stations and signaling devices has been completed, and the design and measurement work for vehicle operation has also been completed.
    
    Construction workers are carrying out large-scale excavation work for tunnels. At each tunnel entrance, many machines have been installed, including excavators, machines for excavating frozen soil, and so on.
    
    Polish factories are preparing to produce various materials used for the construction of the underground railway. A large number of workers and experts who went to the Soviet Union to specifically learn from the experience of building the Moscow underground railway will soon return to participate in the construction of the Warsaw underground railway.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    苏联筹备纪念果戈理百年忌辰
    苏联已开始大规模筹备三月四日俄罗斯伟大作家果戈理逝世百年纪念。
    莫斯科将举行纪念会和纪念碑揭幕典礼。在苏联科学院和莫斯科各教育机关所布置的科学会议上，将发表关于果戈理的创作活动的报告。苏联科学院为了在纪念日出版果戈理的作品，已彻底研究了列宁图书馆所藏的果戈理的约二千四百页的原稿。新版本将包括果戈理的书简，其中有许多还没有发表过。苏联各加盟共和国将出版译成各民族文字的果戈理作品的新版本。全苏联将有七百五十多万册果戈理的作品在他的百年忌辰出版。各个城市和乡村的俱乐部及图书馆，正在组织关于果戈理的生活及其作品的展览会。哈尔科夫的中央科学图书馆已经开办了初版本和稀有版本的展览会。在许多展览品中，有一八四二年出版的四卷本的第一部果戈理全集，以及译成外国语文的果戈理作品的极稀有的版本。苏联的剧院将在纪念日上演“巡按使”、“结婚”、编成剧本的“死魂灵”、“五月之夜”等剧。
    朝鲜文艺创作一年来成绩显著
    朝鲜文学艺术界过去一年中在创作方面取得了显著的成绩。文学部门共创作了歌颂解放战争中的英雄人物的作品五百七十二件，美术部门发表的创作共有一千四百十三件，演出戏剧六十出，新拍的艺术照片有四万零六百九十张，舞蹈创作有六十三种，歌谣创作有三百八十八种。这些作品在鼓舞朝鲜人民的斗争意志、反映朝鲜人民的英勇斗争、增进朝鲜人民和各兄弟国家人民的友谊方面，起了很大的作用。许多优秀的作品得到了崇高的评价。如描述朝鲜少年英勇斗争的艺术片“少年游击队”，在去年的国际电影赛会中得了“争取自由斗争奖”。参加第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的朝鲜人民艺术团演出的节目也得了奖。
    罗马尼亚石油工业的成就
    罗马尼亚一九五一年石油生产计划已提前完成。一九五一年石油产量比一九五○年增加了百分之二十三。
    石油是罗马尼亚重要的财富，蕴藏量占世界第五位。第二次世界大战前美、英资本控制了罗马尼亚油产的百分之八十六。解放以后，罗马尼亚在完全平等的原则下和苏联合组了苏罗石油公司，苏联运去大量机器设备，保证了罗马尼亚石油工业的恢复。罗马尼亚五年计划规定到一九五五年石油年产量要提高到一千万吨。一九四九年罗马尼亚开凿的新油井比一九四五年增加了二倍多，一九五○年又比一九四九年增加四倍多。由于采油技术的进步，许多过去的废井已重新出油，单是一九四九年就从废井中生产了十万吨油。
    华沙建筑地下铁道
    波兰政府已颁布了在华沙建筑地下铁道的决定。现在，设计和勘测工作人员正在加速地进行准备工作。车站和信号装置等的设计工作已经完成，车辆运行的设计和测量工作也已完成了。
    建筑工人们正在大规模地进行挖掘地道的工作。在每一个地道口，都设置了许多机器，包括挖掘机、专挖冻土的机器等等。
    波兰的工厂正准备生产建筑地下铁道所用的各种物资。大批去苏联专门学习建筑莫斯科地下铁道的经验的工人和专家，很快就要回来参加建筑华沙地下铁道的工作。
