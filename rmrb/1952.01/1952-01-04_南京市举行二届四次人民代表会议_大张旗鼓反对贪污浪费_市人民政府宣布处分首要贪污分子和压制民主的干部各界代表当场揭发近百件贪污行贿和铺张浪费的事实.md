(Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd) The Second Session, Fourth People's Representative Conference of Nanjing was held from December 29th to 31st of last year. The conference decided to further launch an anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement among the people of all circles in the city.

Mayor Ke Qingshi of the Nanjing Municipal People's Government and Jiang Weiqing, Director of the Municipal Economy Practice Inspection Committee, both delivered reports at the meeting. In his report, Ke Qingshi emphasized the need to implement the central task for 1952 as adopted by the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which requires, first and foremost, to vigorously and resolutely carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement within the government and all social strata. In his report, Jiang Weiqing pointed out that since the movement began in early December last year within various organs and organizations in the city, it has achieved good results due to the personal involvement of government leaders. Bureaucrats have been shaken, and a large number of corruption and waste phenomena have been exposed. In order to further develop the movement, both Ke Qingshi and Jiang Weiqing called on people from all walks of life to mobilize and participate in this movement, making it a large-scale mass movement.

During the conference, representatives of the Municipal People's Government announced the punishments for several important corrupt elements who refused to confess and cadres who suppressed democracy. Representatives from all walks of life warmly supported the government's decisive and correct measures. Chen Suying, a representative of housewives, said: "From the Qing Dynasty to the Kuomintang reactionary government, which government did not practice corruption from top to bottom? Only the People's Government is the most honest government, and it immediately corrects its shortcomings when they arise." The representatives publicly exposed nearly a hundred cases of illegal merchants inducing cadres to engage in corruption and extravagance and waste in government organs and organizations. Wu Shushan, Vice Chairman of the Shop Employees' Union, reported nine cases of illegal merchants bribing cadres and infringing upon state property. He called on shop employees throughout the city to overcome their personal feelings, mobilize capitalists to confess, and vigorously expose illegal merchants who are stubbornly resistant. Huang Xiren, a representative of the industrial and commercial circles, cited six examples of unscrupulous merchants colluding with cadres, explaining that an important reason for cadre corruption is that some lawless elements in the industrial and commercial circles are doing everything possible to entice them in pursuit of excessive profits. He expressed his determination to resolutely expose this crime. All the representatives of the industrial and commercial circles attending the meeting unanimously proposed to the conference that an "anti-bribery, anti-fraud, anti-profiteering, and anti-tax evasion" movement be launched in the industrial and commercial circles. Their determination was warmly welcomed by representatives from other circles.

The conference finally adopted a resolution "on the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement."

    南京市举行二届四次人民代表会议
    大张旗鼓反对贪污浪费
    市人民政府宣布处分首要贪污分子和压制民主的干部各界代表当场揭发近百件贪污行贿和铺张浪费的事实
    【新华社南京三日电】南京市第二届第四次各界人民代表会议在去年十二月二十九日至三十一日举行。会议决定进一步在全市各界人民中开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。
    南京市人民政府市长柯庆施和市节约检查委员会主任委员江渭清都在会上作了报告。柯庆施在报告中着重指出要贯彻中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议所通过的一九五二年的中心工作，首先就要在政府内部和社会各阶层中大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。江渭清在报告中指出：这一运动自去年十二月初在全市各机关、团体内部展开后，由于政府首长亲自动手，已收到很好的成效。官僚主义者已受到震动，贪污、浪费现象已被大量揭发出来。为着使运动深入发展，柯庆施和江渭清都号召各界人民一齐动员起来参加这一运动，使它成为规模浩大的群众性运动。
    在会议进行期间，市人民政府代表宣布了对于几个拒不坦白的重要贪污分子和压制民主的干部的处分。各界人民代表都热烈拥护政府这种果决、正确的措施。家庭妇女代表陈素英说：“从满清到国民党反动政府，那个政府不是上行下效贪赃枉法的？只有人民政府才是最廉洁的政府，有了缺点马上就纠正。”代表们当场揭发出近百件不法商人引诱干部贪污以及机关团体中铺张浪费的事实。店员工会副主席吴树山检举了九起不法商人向干部行贿侵害国家财产的事实。他号召全市店员工人破除情面，动员资方坦白，对顽固到底的不法商人要大力检举。工商界代表黄希仁举出六个奸商勾引干部的事例，说明干部贪污的一个重要原因是工商界中一部分贪图暴利的不法分子千方百计地对他们进行引诱。他表示要坚决揭发这种罪行。出席会议的全体工商界代表一致向大会提出，要在工商界开展“反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏”运动。他们的决心获得了其他各界代表的热烈欢迎。
    大会最后通过了“关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动”的决议。
