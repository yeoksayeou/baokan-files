    Guarantee to Chairman Mao: We Will Do a Good Job in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    —New Year's Greeting Letter to Chairman Mao from Industrial Labor Model Hao Jianxiu
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    The New Year's Day of 1952 has arrived. Under your leadership, we have happily and victoriously passed another year.
    Over the past year, the Chinese people have achieved unprecedented victories. On the Korean battlefield, we drove the American army back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, eliminating hundreds of thousands of enemy troops; domestically, our construction undertakings have advanced by leaps and bounds, improving day by day. In October, when I attended the National Day ceremony in the capital, I saw the incredibly powerful strength of the Chinese people. I attended the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a nonvoting delegate and witnessed the close unity and concerted efforts of the people of the whole country. I visited the North China Regional Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition and saw the abundant products of our motherland. All this made me feel the greatness and loveliness of our motherland. Our factories, after the Resist America, Aid Korea, Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries, Democratic Reform, and Wage Reform campaigns, have also become better and better. We are working, studying, and living happily, how wonderful!
    However, we are not complacent. We must build our motherland even stronger and more consolidated so that our lives can be more fulfilling. Your instruction at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, "Increase production, practice strict economy, to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," has given us a clear goal to strive for. When I came back and told my comrades, everyone was extremely happy. Our factory is enthusiastically carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy in accordance with your call.
    We have initially checked the serious waste phenomena in our factory. There are really many areas of waste in our factory. For example, the yarn guide rods on the spinning frames are plated with an electro-optic layer for the sake of beauty, which costs more than 50 million yuan. The wooden tubes piled up in the warehouse are enough for machines with 100,000 spindles, but they have not been utilized. In the workshop, we produce a lot of defective yarn ends, averaging more than 4,000 a day, which is equivalent to the yarn spun by one machine. The wasted roving amounts to more than 20 pieces of yarn a year. Other kinds of waste, just in the spinning department, have been found to be more than 200 kinds, wasting more than 2 billion yuan. The total waste in the factory is 4.3 billion yuan, and the backlog of funds is more than 37 billion yuan. How shocking and distressing this is! These are things that we didn't pay much attention to or think about before. This is because we failed to regard the interests of the state as the highest interests, the leadership of our factory still has some bureaucratic work styles, and the sense of responsibility of our workers as masters has not been fully developed. This makes me realize that we must not be complacent or slack in our work at any time!
    While checking these shortcomings, everyone has been using their brains to find ways to overcome them and find shortcuts to increase production. Now the workers in the weaving workshop have also used waste materials and parts to install 46 new looms, 30 of which have been put into operation. Zhang Xiumei in the preparation section came up with a way to make full use of yarn bobbins, which can save more than 34 million yuan a year. The spinning section is also studying the use of defective yarn end parasitic heads, which saves a lot of good yarn. In order to reduce the stop rate, the maintenance workers are studying how to wipe the machines during the idle time when the machines are stopped, and the yarn produced annually is equal to the annual output of one machine, worth 1.5 billion yuan, which can buy a fighter plane. In short, everyone has this idea: how to produce more and save more, to create wealth for the country; even a small wire loop is carefully cherished.
    However, this is only the beginning. We are conducting an in-depth struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. I am very happy to participate in this movement. I assure you: (1) Strive to study, publicize the significance of increasing production and practicing economy that you have told us anytime and anywhere, so that everyone can actively participate in this movement. (2) Boldly expose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and wage a ruthless struggle against thoughts and behaviors that steal and disregard state property. (3) Report situations to the leadership in a timely manner, study problems, take the lead in overcoming difficulties, study shortcuts to increase production and practice economy; give full play to all my abilities, and help everyone improve themselves in the movement. We are launching a competition; we believe that under the leadership of the Party and you, we will achieve greater results in the future. Soon we will formulate a specific plan for increasing production and practicing economy. On New Year's Day, we will use the achievements in increasing production and practicing economy as a New Year's gift to you.
    I wish you good health!
                                                                        Hao Jianxiu
                                                            December 28, 1951

    向毛主席保证：一定要把增产节约做好
    ——工业劳动模范郝建秀给毛主席的贺年信敬爱的毛主席：
    一九五二年元旦来到了。在您的领导下，我们愉快地胜利地又度过了一个年头。
    一年来，中国人民获得了空前的胜利。在朝鲜战场上，咱们把美国军队赶到了三八线附近，消灭敌军几十万；在国内，我们的建设事业是突飞猛进，一天一个样。十月里我在首都参加国庆大典时，看到中国人民强大无比的力量。我列席了人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议，看到全国人民的亲密团结，同心协力。我参观了华北区城乡物资交流展览会，看到祖国的丰富物产。这一切，都使我感到我们祖国的伟大可爱。我们的工厂，经过了抗美援朝、镇压反革命、民主改革、工资改革，也变得越来越好了。我们愉快地工作着、学习着、生活着，多么幸福呵！
    但是，我们并没有自满。我们还要把祖国建设得更强大，更巩固，使我们的生活过得更美满。您在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上指示我们“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”，使我们有了个明确的奋斗目标。我回来告诉同志们的时候，大家也都高兴极了。我们厂里正在按照您的号召热烈地开展着增产节约运动。
    我们初步检查了我们厂里的严重浪费现象。我们厂里的浪费的地方可真不少。比如：细纱机上的导纱杆，为了漂亮，还镀上一层电光，这就多花了五千多万元。仓库里积压的木管还够十万锭子的机器用的，都没发挥作用。在车间里，我们出的坏纱穗还很多，一天平均竟有四千多个，等于一个车子纺的纱。浪费的回丝，一年也要合上二十多件纱。其他各种浪费现象，光在纺部就检查出二百多种，浪费了二十多亿元。全厂浪费共有四十三亿元，积压资金三百七十多亿元。这是多么惊人多么使人痛心啊！这都是我们从前不大注意、没想到的事情。这是我们没能拿国家利益当做最高利益看待，我们工厂的领导方面还有些官僚主义作风，我们职工们的主人翁的责任心也还没充分发挥所造成的结果。这使我体会到，我们的工作一时一刻也不能自满麻痹呵！
    在检查这些缺点的同时，大家都开动脑筋研究出克服的办法，寻找增加生产的窍门。现在织布间的工人也用废料和零件新装了四十六台布机，已有三十台开动起来了。准备间张秀美想出办法充分利用纱把，每年可节约三千四百多万元。细纱间也研究用坏纱穗寄生头，节省很多好纱。保全工为了减少停车率，研究利用停车空隙揩车，每年增产的纱等于一台车的全年生产量，价值十五亿元，能买一架战斗机。总之，大家都有这个想法：怎样多多生产、多多节约，为国家创造财富；就连一个细丝圈都细心地爱惜。
    不过，这还只是开始。我们正在深入地进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。我参加了这个运动，感到很高兴。我向您保证：（一）努力学习，随时随地宣传您告诉我们的增产节约的意义，使每个人都积极参加这个运动。（二）大胆地揭发贪污浪费和官僚主义，开展批评与自我批评，和盗窃国家资财、不关心国家资财的思想行为做无情的斗争。（三）及时向领导方面反映情况，研究问题，带头克服困难，钻研增产节约的窍门；发挥我所有能力，在运动中帮助大家提高自己。我们正发起竞赛；相信在党和您的领导下，今后会得到更大的成绩。不久我们将订出具体的增产节约计划。新年元旦，我们要以增产节约的成绩当作向您贺年的献礼。
    祝您身体健康！    郝建秀
                        一九五一年十二月二十八日
