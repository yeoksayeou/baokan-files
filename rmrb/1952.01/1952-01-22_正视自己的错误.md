Confronting My Mistakes
　　Guang Weiran

　　I made significant mistakes in my work at the Central Academy of Drama in the past. The nature of these mistakes is that, due to my serious detachment from politics, from reality, and from the masses, as well as my neglect of my own ideological transformation, I deviated from the proletarian standpoint in leading literary and artistic work. Instead, I treated literary and artistic work from a petty-bourgeois standpoint and with petty-bourgeois viewpoints. I mistakenly believed that I had mastered the correct literary and artistic line, but in reality, I not only deviated from Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line but also distorted and hindered the implementation of the correct line. In the past (1950), I served as the Dean of Education and Director of the Creative Writing Office at the Central Academy of Drama, and also held the position of General Branch Secretary within the Party. In 1951, I was transferred to work at the Ministry of Culture, maintaining a certain working relationship with the Academy of Drama. Many of the serious phenomena exposed by the Central Academy of Drama during this literary rectification period are largely the negative consequences of my erroneous thinking and work style.

　　My mistakes are manifested in the following aspects:

　　First, in the leadership of theatrical creation, I consistently neglected the political content of works, one-sidedly emphasizing improving artistry and technique, which led to a series of failures. When organizing studies in the Creative Writing Office, I engaged in empty talk about policy, ideology, and class struggle on the ideological front, but in the specific organization of creation and discussion of works, I was always preoccupied with the depiction of characters, the arrangement of plots, and the refinement of language… these secondary aspects. On major issues such as the thematic thought of the works, their educational effect on the audience, and whether they accurately and typically represented the reality of life… I lacked serious consideration. When evaluating an artistic work, I was always accustomed to placing artistic standards first and political standards second. The failure of the drama "Driving at Top Speed" perfectly illustrates this problem. This script was initially written by an industrial cadre who used his personal experiences to oppose bureaucracy in industrial construction and advocate improving industrial productivity. This theme had certain practical significance, but the author's writing attitude was not objective enough, revealing a strong antagonism towards the Party and government leaders in the factory and expressing a strong technical viewpoint. This was the fatal weakness of the script. However, when we received the first draft of the script, we felt that the theme was very realistic, the characters were vivid, and the emotions were full, which aligned with our own somewhat technical viewpoints, so we greatly appreciated it. Although we also persuaded the original author that his attitude was not objective enough and that he had distorted the image of the Party leaders, believing that these areas needed serious revision, we mainly considered it from an artistic point of view, thinking about which characters could be dealt with more vividly, which plots could be dealt with more compactly, and which languages could be more suitable for their identities, and so on. Based on the above opinions, we obtained the original author's consent and handed it over to comrades Liu Canglang and Lu Mei for revision, feeling that they had lived in a yarn factory for a period before entering the city, so they would definitely be able to complete the task happily. As for whether the situation of the Shijiazhuang Yarn Factory depicted in the script conformed to typical life reality, whether it conformed to the rapidly changing life, and whether the revisers could correctly grasp and understand the thoughts and feelings of Party member leading cadres, we did not consider much. At that time, I was still contentedly saying that after this script was revised, it would surpass "Red Flag Song" in terms of ideology and artistry. I attached great importance to this script and participated in the discussion of every detail. During the revision process, it had already been discovered that the author did not accurately grasp the thoughts and feelings of Party members and leading cadres, and the author had also been distressed about this. However, I blindly encouraged him and tried my best to "enlighten" him based on what I could understand, encouraging the author to "imagine" and "speculate," which was actually encouraging the author to use petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings to fill and replace the proletarian thoughts and feelings that he was not familiar with. At the time, I did not think this was wrong or dangerous. This script was discussed many times in the Creative Writing Office and revised repeatedly three times. Finally, I personally polished it from beginning to end. Although I felt that there were still many places where the language of the Party cadres did not match their identity, I generally felt that it was acceptable. But what was the result? Not only did it not change the original fatal weaknesses, but it also exacerbated these weaknesses in some places. In order to pursue artistry and drama, the authenticity of life was sacrificed to comply with the requirements of the plot. As a result, the work of the Party and the trade union in the factory was described very incorrectly, and the image of the Party members and leading cadres in the factory was given a superficial and distorted representation. In fact, the leadership of the Party and the trade union in the factory was eliminated. The positive characters who were originally considered to have distinct personalities and full of emotions were injected with petty-bourgeois blood one by one. Through the language and actions of these so-called positive characters, the script actually advocated a pure technical viewpoint and promoted a lack of organization and discipline (see Comrade Liu Canglang's self-criticism article in "People's Drama," Volume 3, Issue 6). "Driving at Top Speed" thus failed.

　　The failure of "Driving at Top Speed" did not give me enough warning. Although I made a self-criticism at the time, I did not completely solve the problem ideologically. As a result, I repeated the mistakes one after another. Like "Starting from Scratch," which distorted and uglified the image of Party member cadres, like "Mother's Heart" and "People's Will," which expressed significant petty-bourgeois viewpoints, like "Jie Zhenguo," which was not based on typical material and, in some places, erroneously beautified the personal heroism of the characters in the play, these scripts were initially approached from an artistic point of view or from the work's abstract political enthusiasm. I felt that they had gotten rid of the problems of formalism and conceptualization, and the characters had been established, so I encouraged them without principle, considering them to be "very good" works. When I heard someone criticizing the shortcomings of the two scripts "Mother's Heart" and "People's Will," I did not listen to and consider these opinions with an open mind. Instead, as Comrade Ding Ling criticized, I abused my position as Deputy Editor-in-Chief of "People's Drama" and hurriedly published my own "recommendation" article to help the author reject criticism and defend the mistakes. (For a self-criticism of the errors and shortcomings in the editorial work of "People's Drama," see the "Notice to Readers on Suspension of Publication" in Volume 3, Issue 8 of the journal.)

　　Scripts like "Driving at Top Speed" and "Starting from Scratch" have a common mistake, which is distorting and uglifying the image of Party member cadres and criticizing their shortcomings from a petty-bourgeois perspective, which turned into slander and vilification. This is directly related to the one-sidedness of the leadership's thinking in the Creative Writing Office in the past. I once misunderstood the ideological nature of literary and artistic works. In the spring of the year before last, I declared in the Creative Writing Office that I wanted to "strengthen criticism" and advocated writing a "three-part series on cadre thought," with "Driving at Top Speed" as the first part of this "three-part series." On the one hand, I neglected the ideological transformation of young authors, and on the other hand, I encouraged them to criticize the shortcomings of our new life and the shortcomings of our Party member cadres from a petty-bourgeois perspective. This would certainly lead them to erroneous and failed paths. As for the serious phenomena of detachment from politics and life and the various manifestations of petty-bourgeois artistic thought that occurred in the Creative Writing Office under my leadership, I have discussed them in my article "Experiences and Lessons of the Creative Writing Office of the Central Academy of Drama" (see "People's Drama," Volume 3, Issue 6), so I will not repeat them here.

　　In the leadership of performance work at the Academy of Drama, I also consistently neglected politics and one-sidedly emphasized improving artistry and technique. When the North China University Art Troupe was reorganized into the Opera Troupe, Drama Troupe, and Dance Troupe of the Academy of Drama, I proposed the slogans of developing towards specialization and piloting enterprise management, and I also required that the performances of our troupes should meet the central level and the national level. Of course, it was still possible to propose this. The problem was that we gave the performance groups very heavy tasks of improvement, but what to improve and how to improve it? I didn't think it through very clearly. At that time, I only had a general concept in my mind, which was: our actors have professional distress, so we must improve professionally; our art troupe members have not received professional training for a long time, so we must strengthen professional training. When summarizing the work of the entire Academy in the first half of the year before last, I also put forward two slogans, namely: "Improve the quality of performances and strengthen professional learning." What to improve and what to learn? My formulation was: "Improve the level of theory and technology." The so-called theory generally referred to literary and artistic thought and creative methods, etc. In this regard, later facts proved that we had relaxed. The so-called technology at the time referred to basic training in performance techniques, vocal training, and dance, etc. In this regard, later facts proved that it was implemented. At that time, in all the performance groups of the entire Academy, the atmosphere of improving technology overwhelmed everything. Coupled with the weak political leadership and ideological leadership of the entire Academy, it gradually formed a serious tendency to detach from politics, detach from life, and ignore popularization work, which fueled the rise of petty-bourgeois and bourgeois formalism, technical viewpoints, and individualism. It turned into closed-door improvement, detached from the masses, detached from the national drama movement and popularization work, and the quality of performances became lower and lower, completely losing the exemplary role and guiding popularization role that we had touted. During the rectification campaign at the end of the year before last, some comrades expressed doubts about our practices at the time and even criticized the then deviation of detaching from popularization and detaching from the movement. However, I adopted the attitude of adhering to the mistakes, only thinking that "our combination with the movement is not enough, and our guidance on popularization is powerless," but overall, I still believed that "the goal we pursued in artistic improvement conformed to the requirements of the movement and conformed to the practical and long-term interests of the people, so it cannot be said that a tendency to detach from the movement has already occurred." Moreover, I one-sidedly based my argument on the fact that art troupes in various places asked us for scripts but we had no scripts, asked us for materials but we had no materials, and asked us for lectures but we had no lectures, and forcibly argued: "If we cannot improve ourselves, we cannot improve others; if we cannot solve our own professional distress, we cannot solve others' professional distress; if we cannot quickly move towards specialization, we cannot talk about helping others move towards specialization. The main shortcomings in the past were not that we did not do a good job in popularization, but that we did not do a good job in improvement; the main shortcomings were not that we did not do a good job in guiding others, but that we did not strengthen our own learning." This was actually rudely rejecting criticism and publicly defending the rationality and legitimacy of our closed-door improvement.

　　I would like to take "Peace Dove" as an example to further illustrate my confused concepts in popularization and improvement and learning technology. The creation of the dance drama "Peace Dove" demonstrated President Ouyang Yuqian's political enthusiasm for the movement to defend world peace. However, because I did not help President Ouyang enough and did not lead the dance troupe enough, this dance drama was not profound enough in its expression of the theme. Many places started from form, from scenes, and from techniques. This dance drama made a crude transplantation of Western ballet. Both the dance and the music lacked any originality. Since this dance drama did not specifically describe the Chinese people's struggle to defend peace and oppose aggression, but generally and diagrammatically showed the so-called international struggle scenes, it could not profoundly express the Chinese people's desire and determination to defend world peace. From the dance and the music, one could not see or hear the great will of our great people. Although I felt and talked about these serious shortcomings at the time, I thought that it would not hurt to try "artistically" and regarded supporting the performance of this script as the highest principle, not hesitating to create various erroneous remarks to defend its shortcomings. For example, after "Peace Dove" was performed, some people doubted whether this could represent the direction of the development of Chinese dance art. This doubt was completely justified. However, I defended that the performance of "Peace Dove" "was a meaningful attempt" and that "one attempt does not represent a definite direction," believing that this attempt was actually "one of the necessary steps to build the national form of dance and move towards the correct direction of dance." This was of course a far-fetched statement. For example, some people doubted how a general art troupe could perform a dance drama like "Peace Dove." This doubt was also completely reasonable. However, I defended that a part of our performance program could be one that general art troupes could not perform. That is to say, we could have a part of the improvement that was completely detached from popularization, an improvement that had no guiding role for popularization. This was of course also completely wrong. For example, some people were very dissatisfied after watching "Peace Dove" and wrote a doggerel poem, saying: "Thighs run all over the stage, workers, peasants, and soldiers can't stand it." I was very angry when I heard this and actually said something like this: "We must strive for the day when workers, peasants, and soldiers can stand it in a few years!" This was actually resisting criticism and expressing the determination of art to detach from the people. From this sentence, one could not smell any proletarian flavor.

　　In the leadership of teaching work, my errors were consistent with other aspects. I consistently detached from reality and did not understand the real needs of the art troupe members below. I only had some general, conceptual understanding of the art troupe cadres who came to the school to study. I felt that they were relatively strong politically, had considerable work experience, lacked systematic theory and had empiricism, they had professional distress in their work, and lacked formal learning in technology and needed improvement. Based on these conceptual understandings, the teaching tasks I put forward were mainly: "Help them summarize their experiences and improve their professional theory and technical level." Not a single word here mentioned political improvement or ideological improvement. The so-called helping to summarize experience actually became empty talk. Here, experience should refer to the experience of learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers, the experience of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, the experience of art popularization and art propaganda, and so on. When the leading ideology was keen on closed-door improvement, these experiences would not be valued. These experiences were not seriously helped to be summarized and become systematic materials, and they were not concentrated and become a source for enriching teaching and improving teaching. On the contrary, in my dogmatic mind, I was very disrespectful to these experiences, and I regarded everyone with practical experience as empiricism, and I wanted to use dogmatic methods and petty-bourgeois artistic views to "struggle" with it. How could this urge our cadres to seriously help them summarize their experiences, use them to enrich and improve our teaching, and use them as the basis for artistic improvement? In this way, what remained was that professional theory classes and technical classes occupied almost the entire course content. These courses also reflected our policy of closed-door improvement, because in terms of teaching content, the research and study of the current situation of the drama movement and the current situation of popularization work, such as drama creation issues, opera reform issues, and mass amateur drama activities, did not occupy the due position. Courses that studied Chinese opera heritage and Chinese folk art were either unable to combine with reality (such as the history of Chinese opera) or were not systematic or frequent (such as local opera). In short, they did not show their prominent position. On the other hand, due to our weak ideological leadership of teaching cadres, some unreformed teachers once used the classroom as a platform to promote bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas. All of this should be condemned by us.

　　Due to my serious neglect of politics and the masses' demands for art, the issue of "serving whom" in art was not fundamentally resolved in my mind. Therefore, my artistic thought could not help but fall into extreme confusion. Therefore, in the relationship between popularization and improvement, I excessively and inappropriately emphasized improvement, which fueled the tendency to despise popularization and the tendency to improve behind closed doors. On the issue of what to improve and how to improve, I excessively and inappropriately emphasized improving artistry, which fueled the tendency to detach from politics and life. On the issue of improving artistry and improving business, I excessively and inappropriately emphasized improving technology, which fueled the technical viewpoints and bourgeois artistic viewpoints among cadres. On the issue of improving technology and learning technology, I excessively and inappropriately emphasized learning Western technology, which fueled the unpatriotic tendency to despise national heritage and blindly worship the West. The wrong leadership ideology formed the wrong line. This line became farther and farther away from Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, and finally completely violated Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line and violated the ideological principles of the proletariat. This erroneous, petty-bourgeois literary and artistic thought and petty-bourgeois literary and artistic line once occupied a leading position in the Central Academy of Drama and in the Party organization of the Central Academy of Drama. This is the fundamental reason why the proletarian leadership was not realized in the Academy of Drama in the past and caused huge losses to the people's drama cause.

　　This loss could have been avoided, because there had been struggles within the Party at the Academy of Drama, and there had been sharp struggles. For example, the various serious phenomena exposed by the Academy of Drama in 1951 had been sharply raised by many comrades during the Party's rectification campaign at the end of 1950. However, I lacked the most basic awareness at the time. Honest advice was unpleasant to my ears, and I couldn't listen to many words. In my petty-bourgeois eyes, I regarded the correct opinions as "old-fashioned." In my dogmatic mind, I regarded all the cadres who insisted on the correct opinions as "empiricism." In addition, my Party spirit was impure, and I lacked a democratic spirit and a humble and prudent attitude. I was subjective and arrogant, and I couldn't listen to opposing opinions. I stood high above the masses and the cadres, thinking that I insisted on the correct things, and I treated criticism with a rude attitude, suppressed democracy, and allowed the mistakes to develop to a serious point. My organizational discipline was very weak. When there was a fundamental and directional dispute within the Party, I did not report it to the higher authorities in a timely manner and asked for instructions. I treated the rectification campaign with a very unserious attitude and made an erroneous petty-bourgeois conclusion for the 1950 rectification campaign. In this way, the correct opinions were not promoted, but the erroneous opinions were supported.

　　My erroneous thoughts and work style also caused damage to the Party's united front work. Facts have proved that the Party's united front work at the Academy of Drama had long produced a right-leaning tendency. However, in the past, every time the comrades in the Party reminded me, I always thought that what we should prevent was not a right-leaning deviation, but a left-leaning deviation. From the first day of the establishment of the General Branch of the Academy of Drama, I reminded all Party members that they should cooperate well with non-Party members and prevent the deviation of left-leaning sectarianism. It was still necessary to propose this at that time. After that, the Academy absorbed a large number of artists and art youths from the new district, which was a gratifying phenomenon. But at the same time, it brought various non-proletarian ideas, which needed to be criticized and educated to help them carry out ideological transformation to achieve true unity. However, I ignored this basic situation and consistently emphasized unity while ignoring struggle. Under the control of this erroneous thinking, from the Party leaders on down, the armament of ideological struggle was lifted. I had been engaged in the united front work in the cultural circles in the Kuomintang-controlled areas for a long time in the past. The situation and conditions at that time were different. In addition, my understanding of the united front was superficial, and I had also shown a right-leaning tendency in my work at that time. I cannot correctly implement the Party's united front policy in the current new situation, which has a lot to do with past work habits. When I contacted non-Party members, I always paid special attention to working methods. Paying attention to methods is good, but I replaced principles with methods. I was always afraid of hurting the self-esteem of petty-bourgeois cadres. This method of accommodation and compromise actually blocked the path for non-Party cadres to move forward. When these comrades realized this, no one would thank me. More importantly, my literary and artistic thought and some of the backward artistic views of certain non-Party comrades had common ground. In this case, being afraid of hurting the petty bourgeoisie was also afraid of hurting myself. The music work can be used as an example. I don't understand music, and I have a smattering of knowledge about music. Most of this superficial knowledge has accepted bourgeois artistic dogmas. Bourgeois classical music had fascinated me for a period of time. With such tastes and hobbies, when I began to enter the liberated areas, I was somewhat out of tune with the Yangko music. Over the years, there have been some changes in my emotions, but I have never broken off the emotional connection with the so-called high-level forms of music architecture of the bourgeoisie and the musical mood of the petty bourgeoisie. In this case, it is very difficult for me to conduct a strong leadership of the music work of the entire academy and to conduct a profound struggle against the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois music thoughts. "Peace Dove" is another typical example. I have some opinions on President Ouyang's script. First of all, I am not satisfied with the creative method, the style, and the design of certain scenes and plots. My so-called help also focused on these artistic issues. I did not focus on providing political help for President Ouyang's creative enthusiasm, especially did not help him gather the opinions of the masses to carry out effective revisions. On the contrary, I persuaded the comrades of the dance troupe to perform this script on the one hand, and persuaded everyone in the Party not to raise opinions on the other hand. After the performance, the comrades had many opinions, and they raised them very sharply. I was afraid of hurting President Ouyang, so I concealed him on the one hand, so that he could not hear these opinions, and on the other hand, I created many erroneous theories to suppress these criticisms. This blocked President Ouyang's connection with the masses. Such unity is of course vulgar unity. The matter is very clear. Because I lack proletarian ideological principles, I cannot achieve principled unity when cooperating with non-Party members. Because I have not drawn a clear line between myself and non-proletarian thoughts ideologically, I cannot draw a clear ideological line in the united front work. Because my literary and artistic thoughts are confused, I cannot help the Party and non-Party comrades of the entire academy to clarify the confusion of literary and artistic thoughts.

　　The fundamental reasons for my serious errors and serious confusion in literary and artistic thought are mainly in the following two aspects:

　　First, in the depths of my mind, there is a dualistic view of politics and art, popularization and improvement. The petty-bourgeois artistic viewpoint does not have its own system. Most of it accepts the artistic influence of the bourgeoisie. In the past, I had been enthusiastic and bowed down to certain literary, drama, and music works of the bourgeoisie for a long time. Although most of the artistic works of foreign bourgeois society that I loved had certain progressiveness and democratic nature, I lacked the ability to criticize (if I criticized, I also used the petty-bourgeois tastes and hobbies to criticize). The exaggerated descriptions of individual strength and individual emotions in these works, as well as the descriptions of the dark side of society, catered to the hobbies of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie. On the other hand, certain artistic methods and artistic laws of bourgeois literary works that seem backward today have also unconsciously and strongly influenced me. That is to say, I have become a prisoner of bourgeois literary dogmas and artistic dogmas invisibly. These influences combined with the tastes and hobbies of the petty bourgeoisie form a prejudice. When observing literature and art, I do not start from politics and class requirements first, but from literary and artistic dogmas. There is often a subjective and unbreakable idea that this is literature, and that is not; this is art, and that is not. And then there is how new opera should be, how new music should be, how new dance should be, and so on. Starting from the abstract "should be," not from actual needs. If political content and life truth contradict these subjective and abstract artistic dogmas, it is better to sacrifice political content and life truth for the sake of dogmas. The errors that occurred in my leadership work in the Creative Writing Office can be explained from this point. In this way, in the unconscious depths of my mind, there is a view that politics and art can be parallel to each other. That is to say, politics should be proletarian; literature and art can also be petty-bourgeois or bourgeois. For example, when I was working in Kunming around 1944, I was engaged in a fierce struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime, and I wrote some political essays and some political satire poems. These had played a certain role in the struggle. But at this time, I also wrote and published a collection of lyric poems that completely expressed the backward feelings of petty-bourgeois individualism. I clearly knew that doing so "not only damages the strict position of a progressive poet, but also is a permanent shame for a literary warrior," and I also scolded myself in the postscript of this collection of poems: "Can these poems be published? Can such things be seen? Can this collection represent yourself? Arrogant feelings, biased poems, empty and abstract words, arrogant and pretentious ugliness and pretentious language, that is to make people vomit for three days!" Even so, I still thought that these poems had a certain artistic value, and I still published them with a thick face. This dualistic view of politics and art, which I thought had been liquidated ideologically, was actually not completely liquidated. This dualism of politics and art is actually a disguised view of art for art's sake. The reason why it can exist in the mind of a Party member literary and artistic worker is that I was born in the petty bourgeoisie, my revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit are not strong, and I lack a strong desire to regard literature and art as a revolutionary weapon. I often overemphasize artistry and technique, and I often value artistry and neglect politics when observing artistic works, which can be explained from this point.

　　Because I overemphasize artistry and ignore political requirements and the people's requirements, I overemphasize improvement and produce a dualistic view of improvement and popularization. I intellectually agree with and support Chairman Mao's policy of "popularization first." I feel that if this policy is implemented, it will greatly develop the artistic creativity of the broad masses, and it will turn our country into a large garden of literature and art in a few years. I am excited about this, but I feel that doing such work is someone else's business, as if it has little to do with myself. As for us, we are specialized in doing improvement work and constructing high-level art. This kind of improvement and construction work seems to be able to do without any solid foundation. I often say that our task is to take the achievements that have been achieved on the basis of popularization in the past and improve them one step further. According to this logic, the task for tomorrow is to improve what we are improving behind closed doors today; and then we will rise step by step, rise to a castle in the air, completely regardless of what popularization is. In particular, this kind of castle-in-the-air improvement mainly focuses on artistry. As for the ideological content, I don't pay much attention to it. This is an idea that is detached from the people. This will lead art and artists to a dead end. I remember a few years ago in the rural areas of the liberated areas, in such difficult conditions, some musicians were distressed because symphonic music was not popular, and some painters were distressed because they could not paint oil paintings. They complained to me, and I sympathized with them, which shows that my tendency to improve wholeheartedly and ignore popularization has been around for a long time. With the petty-bourgeois and bourgeois artistic viewpoints, although I was amazed by the great political mobilization effect of the literary and artistic works in the liberated areas, in terms of artistic form, especially in terms of the artistic form of the Yangko opera, I felt that it seemed too simple and too rough. I felt that with our strength, we could have done it better. For example, the character image could be more distinct, the music could be richer, and the singing could be more pleasing, and so on. This view was not completely wrong in itself. The mistake was to consider it from abstract artistic dogmas, disregarding the people's hobbies and the people's appreciation habits, and trying to make an unrealistic improvement with the petty-bourgeois impatience. This idea was naturally difficult to realize under the conditions at that time. After entering the city, the cadre conditions and material conditions were different. This idea was supported by a large number of petty bourgeoisie, so this impatient psychology of one-sided improvement developed into a specific practice of closed-door improvement.

　　The second reason for the formation of erroneous thoughts, and also the more important reason, is that I have been detached from reality and detached from the masses for a long time. For a long time, I have been engaged in the so-called revolutionary cultural work, and I have mostly contacted middle and upper-level intellectuals. I can talk to these people and my thoughts and feelings are easily integrated with them. I have little contact with the working people, and I cannot talk to them and cannot integrate with them. In the past, in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, or it can be said that due to the limitations of political and social conditions, after arriving in the liberated areas and living in the countryside and small towns, although I was in charge of administrative work, I had a certain opportunity to contact the working people after all, but I did not feel that being detached from the masses was a fatal injury to a literary and artistic worker, and I did not fully use all possible opportunities to learn from the masses diligently. For a long time, I have been floating in the upper class, doing the so-called cultural work, ideological work, and the work of using pens and mouths. It is easy to create an illusion that you can still write articles and tell the truth without contacting the masses and without understanding the needs of the masses. Over time, you become a revolutionary empty talker and are not ashamed, but proud of it. For a long time, I have been detached from reality, detached from workers, peasants, and soldiers in life and thought. I do not understand their needs, or at least I cannot appreciate their urgent needs. I am not familiar with their lives, interests, and hobbies. In addition, my ideological consciousness has not been thoroughly transformed, and my literary and artistic concepts are confused. This has made the artistic work I lead farther and farther away from the needs of the masses, developed mistakes, and insisted on mistakes. On the other hand, because I have been in contact with petty-bourgeois intellectuals for a long time, I have long been integrated with them in life and thought. I understand their needs, I am familiar with their lives, interests, and hobbies, so I often forget the workers, peasants, and soldiers in my mind, and I remember the petty bourgeoisie. I cannot be a spokesperson for workers, peasants, and soldiers in art issues, but I often become a spokesperson for the petty bourgeoisie. For example, insisting on the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers and adhering to the proletarian ideological principles seems to be too "narrow" in the eyes of the petty bourgeoisie. The petty bourgeoisie is often dissatisfied with this and requires "loosening the standards." On the one hand, I explain to such comrades the reasons why the standards cannot be loosened, but on the other hand, my own deep thoughts also have the same feeling and requirement. I remember that at a conference of North China literary and artistic workers in Shijiazhuang in 1948, I myself echoed this kind of "loosening the standards" and publicly acted as a spokesperson for the petty bourgeoisie. During the period of working at the Academy of Drama, this thought was still playing a role. For example, as mentioned earlier, I created various erroneous arguments, such as the sophistry about "Peace Dove," the sophistry during the rectification period, and the sophistry about the united front work. In fact, I was acting as a spokesperson for the petty bourgeoisie, distorting Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line in all aspects, and insisting on the petty-bourgeois literary and artistic line in all aspects. I not only advocated loosening the standards, but also directly handled and greatly loosened the standards. Another code name for loosening the standards is what I call "improvement." Whether it is "loosening" or "improvement," the objective is to open doors and develop markets for the petty bourgeoisie. After the Yan'an rectification and after Chairman Mao's teachings, the literary and artistic workers in the liberated areas automatically blocked the back door of the petty bourgeoisie and blocked all the side doors and crooked paths that violated the interests of workers, peasants, and soldiers, leaving only a road that was difficult, but bright, which is Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line - the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers. But at the Central Academy of Drama, through my hands, the side doors and crooked paths of the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie, which had been blocked after painful struggles in the past, were opened one by one by me. And I called on the comrades to go boldly, all the way to the direction completely opposite to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the point of error and failure.

　　As a Party member literary and artistic worker, I sincerely intended to do some work for the Party and the people. However, due to being seriously detached from politics, from reality, and from the masses for a long time, I have always been arrogant and neglected my own ideological transformation, so that erroneous thoughts could develop to an almost irreparable point. This is something I had never realized before. I thought I had mastered Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, but in fact, I distorted Chairman Mao's line and used my own relatively systematic erroneous theories to obstruct and hinder the implementation of the correct literary and artistic line. The petty-bourgeois thoughts and work style could develop to such a stubborn and terrible degree that it could become a resistance to revolutionary literary and artistic work, at least for a period of time. These are also things that I had never realized before. After initially checking out these erroneous thoughts and work style with the help of comrades this time, and starting to realize its seriousness and harmfulness, I was greatly surprised and suddenly woke up! Although I am not working at the Academy of Drama now, I am still participating in some leadership work in other literary and artistic positions. The burden is even heavier than before. In the past year, I have had a preliminary awakening in my thoughts, but I am still far from being truly awakened. If I cannot thoroughly examine my own erroneous thoughts and seriously transform myself, how can I do my own work well in the future? Therefore, I sincerely ask comrades to continue to help me. I must make up my mind, face my own mistakes and resolutely correct these mistakes, and advance together with the comrades. (Written on January 13, 1952, based on the draft report given at the plenary meeting of the Central Academy of Drama at the end of last year.)

    正视自己的错误
  　光未然
    我过去在中央戏剧学院的工作中犯了很大的错误。错误的性质是，由于自己严重地脱离政治，脱离实际，脱离群众，忽视本身的思想改造，于是在文艺工作的领导上，离开了无产阶级的立场，以小资产阶级的立场、观点来对待文艺工作；自以为掌握了正确的文艺路线，实际上不但脱离了毛主席的文艺路线，而且歪曲了和妨害了正确路线的贯彻执行。我过去（一九五○年）在中央戏剧学院担任教育长和创作室主任的职务，党内还担任总支书记的工作；一九五一年调中央文化部工作，和戏剧学院还保持一定的工作联系。中央戏剧学院在此次文艺整风期间暴露出来的许多严重现象，绝大部分都是我的错误的思想、作风所遗留下来的不良后果。
    我的错误表现在以下几个方面：
    首先在戏剧创作的领导上，一贯地忽视作品的政治内容，片面地强调提高艺术性和提高技巧，造成了一连串的失败。在创作室组织学习的时候，我也空谈了一阵政策性、思想性、思想战线上的阶级斗争等等，但在具体的组织创作，讨论创作的场合，却总是热中于人物性格的刻划，剧情的安排，语言的洗练……这些次要的方面，而在作品的主题思想，对观众的教育效果，是否正确地典型地表现生活真实……这些主要问题上，却缺乏认真的考虑。在评价一个艺术作品的时候，我总是惯于把艺术标准放在第一位，把政治标准放在第二位。话剧“开快车”的失败，正好说明这个问题。这个剧本最初是一个工业干部写的，作者用自己亲身的体验，通过这个剧本来反对工业建设中的官僚主义，主张提高工业生产力，这个主题是有一定的现实意义的，但是作者的写作态度是不够客观的，对于工厂中的党政领导，流露着浓厚的对抗情绪，表现了浓厚的技术观点，这就是这个剧本的致命的弱点。可是我们拿到这个剧本初稿的时候，觉得主题很现实，性格很鲜明，情绪很丰满，投合了自己思想上也多少存在着的技术观点，因此就大为赞赏起来。虽然也曾说服原作者，认为他的态度不够客观，歪曲了党的领导人物的形象，认为这些地方需要认真地修改；但主要还是从艺术上去考虑，觉得哪些人物性格还可以处理得更鲜明一些，哪些地方剧情还可以处理得更紧凑一些，哪些地方语言还可以更适合身份一些等等。我们根据上述的意见，征得原作者的同意，交给刘沧浪、鲁煤两同志来修改；觉得他们两人入城前在纱厂生活过一个时期，一定可以胜任愉快。至于剧本中描写的石家庄纱厂的情况，是否符合于典型的生活真实，是否符合日新月异的生活变化，修改者对于党员领导干部的思想感情能否正确地掌握体会等等，就不多考虑了。当时自己还心安理得地说，这个剧本修改出来以后，在思想性艺术性方面都会超过“红旗歌”的。我很重视这个剧本，曾经参与每一段细节的讨论，在修改过程中已经发现了执笔者对党员、领导干部思想感情有掌握得不对头的地方，执笔者也曾为此苦闷过；但我却一味地鼓励，并且就自己所能够体会到的部分，极力加以“启发”，鼓励作者去“想像”和“揣摹”，这实际上是鼓励作者用小资产阶级的思想感情来填补和代替自己所不熟悉的无产阶级的思想感情，我当时却不以为这是错误的、危险的。这个剧本在创作室经过了多次的讨论，反复修改了三遍，最后还经过我从头到尾润色了一遍，虽然觉得党员干部的语言还有很多不合身份的地方，但大体上觉得是可以了。但是结果怎样呢？不但没有改掉原来的致命弱点，反而在某些地方助长了这些弱点。为了追求艺术性、戏剧性，不惜牺牲生活的真实以屈从剧情的要求，结果对工厂中党的工作、工会的工作，作了非常不正确的描写，对工厂中党员、领导干部的形象，作了肤浅的歪曲的表现，实际上是取消了工厂中党的领导、工会的领导，原来被认为性格鲜明情绪饱满的正面人物，一个个被注入小资产阶级的血液，剧本通过了这些所谓正面人物的语言行动，实际是提倡了单纯的技术观点，宣扬了无组织无纪律（参看“人民戏剧”三卷六期刘沧浪同志的检讨文章）。“开快车”就这样失败了。
    “开快车”的失败并没有引起我足够的警惕。当时我虽然作了检讨，但在思想上却没有彻底解决问题；结果是接二连三地重复了错误。像“从头学起”歪曲了丑化了党员干部的形象，像“母亲的心”、“人民的意志”表现了显著的小资产阶级观点，像“节振国”取材不典型，而又在某些地方错误地美化了剧中人物的个人英雄主义，这几个剧本，最初我也是片面地从艺术性出发，或者从作品的抽象的政治热情出发，觉得是摆脱了公式化概念化的毛病，人物的性格是树立起来了，就无原则地加以鼓励，认为是“很好的”作品。对“母亲的心”、“人民的意志”这两个剧本，听到有人在指摘它的缺点，我不是虚心地听取和考虑这些意见，而是正如丁玲同志所批评的，我滥用了“人民戏剧”副主编的地位，赶忙发表了自己一篇“推荐”的文章，帮助作者拒绝批评、维护错误。（关于“人民戏剧”编辑工作上的错误和缺点的检讨，另见该刊三卷八期“停刊告读者”一文。）
    像“开快车”“从头学起”这样的剧本，有一个共同的错误，就是歪曲了、丑化了党员干部的形象，以小资产阶级的眼光来批评他们的缺点，结果变成了诽谤和诬蔑。这和以往创作室领导思想的片面性有直接的关系。我曾经错误地理解文艺作品的思想性；前年春天，我在创作室扬言要“加强批评”，主张写“干部思想三部曲”，而以“开快车”作为这个“三部曲”的第一部。我一方面忽视青年作者的思想改造，一方面又鼓励他们用小资产阶级的眼光来批评我们新生活的缺点，批评我们党员干部的缺点，这当然会把他们带到错误的、失败的道路。至于创作室在我的领导之下，产生了脱离政治、脱离生活的严重现象以及小资产阶级艺术思想的各种表现，在我去年写的“中央戏剧学院创作室的经验教训”（见人民戏剧三卷六期）一文中已有所论述，这里就不再重复了。
    在戏剧学院的演出工作的领导上，我也是一贯地忽视政治、片面地强调提高艺术性、提高技术的。当华北大学文工团改组为戏剧学院歌剧团、话剧团、舞蹈团的时候，我就提出了向专业化发展和试行企业化的口号，并且要求我们剧团的演出，应该符合于中央的水平、国家的水平。当然这样提出也还是可以的。问题在于，我们给了演出团体很繁重的提高的任务，至于提高什么，如何提高呢？我却没有想得很清楚。当时我的头脑里只有一个笼统的概念，就是：我们演员存在着业务苦闷，因此要提高业务，我们文工团员长期没有得到业务学习，因此要加强业务学习。前年上半年全院工作总结的时候，我又提出了两句口号，就是：“提高演出质量，加强业务学习。”提高什么，学习什么呢？我的提法是
    “提高理论和技术的水平”，所谓理论，大体上是指文艺思想和创作方法等等，这一方面，后来事实证明，我们是放松了的。所谓技术，当时是指表演技术、练声、舞蹈等基本训练，这一方面，后来事实证明，是得到贯彻的，当时在全院各演出团体中，提高技术的空气压倒了一切。加之全院政治领导、思想领导的薄弱，就逐渐形成了严重的脱离政治、脱离生活和忽视普及工作的倾向，就助长了小资产阶级、资产阶级的形式主义、技术观点和个人主义的抬头，变成了关门提高、脱离群众，脱离了全国戏剧运动和普及工作，演出质量越来越降低，完全失掉了我们所标榜的示范作用和指导普及的作用。前年年终整风的时候，曾经有些同志对我们当时的做法表示怀疑，甚至对当时脱离普及脱离运动的偏向提出批评，我却采取了坚持错误的态度，只是认为“我们和运动的结合是不够的，对普及的指导是无力的”，但总起来说，还认为“我们在艺术提高方面所追求的鹄的，是符合于运动要求的，是符合于人民的现实利益和远大利益的，因之就不能说是已经发生了脱离运动的倾向”；而且片面地根据各地文工团问我们要剧本没有剧本，要材料没有材料，要讲义没有讲义的事实，强词夺理地辩解：“如果我们不能提高自己，就无法提高别人；如果不能解决自己的业务苦闷，也就无法解决别人的业务苦闷；如果自己不能迅速走向专业化，也就谈不上帮助别人走向专业化，以往的缺点，主要的不是没有做好普及，而是没有做好提高，主要的不是没有做好对别人的指导，而是没有加强自己的学习。”这实际上是横暴地拒绝批评，公开申辩自己关门提高的合理性和合法性。
    我想拿“和平鸽”作为例子，进一步说明我在普及与提高和学习技术方面的糊涂观念。舞剧“和平鸽”的创作，说明了欧阳予倩院长在保卫世界和平运动上的政治热情，但是由于我对于欧阳先生的帮助不够，对舞蹈团的领导不够，这个舞剧在主题的表现上是很不深刻的，许多地方是从形式出发、从场面出发、从技巧出发的，这个舞剧将西洋的巴蕾舞作了生硬的搬用，舞蹈方面和音乐方面，都缺乏任何的独创性；这个舞剧既然没有具体地描写中国人民保卫和平、反对侵略的斗争生活，而是一般地图式化地表现出所谓国际性的斗争场景，这就不能深刻地表现中国人民保卫世界和平的愿望和决心，从舞蹈上、从音乐上都看不出也听不出我们伟大人民的伟大意志。这些严重缺点，虽然我当时也感觉到并且谈论到了，但却以为“在艺术上”不妨尝试一下，并且把支持这个剧本的演出当成最高的原则，不惜制造出各种错误的言论来维护它的缺点。譬如说，“和平鸽”演出以后，有人怀疑这是不是能够代表中国舞蹈艺术发展的方向；这个怀疑是完全有理由的；可是我却辩护说，“和平鸽”的上演“是一个有意义的尝试”，“一次的尝试并不代表一个肯定的方向”，认为这种尝试竟然是“建设舞蹈的民族形式、走向舞蹈的正确方向的必要步骤之一”，这当然是一种强词夺理的说法。譬如说，有人怀疑“和平鸽”这样的舞剧一般的文工团怎样能够演出；这样的怀疑也是完全合理的；可是我却辩护说，我们的演出节目中可以有一部分是一般的文工团不能上演的，这就是说，我们可以有一部分完全脱离普及的提高，对普及毫无指导作用的提高，这当然也是完全错误的。又譬如说，有人看了“和平鸽”很不满意，编了打油诗，说是：“大腿满台跑，工农兵受不了。”我听了很生气，竟然说出这样的话：“我们就要为若干年后工农兵受得了而奋斗！”这实际上是抗拒批评，表示了艺术脱离人民的决心；从这句话里，已经嗅不到任何无产阶级的气味了。
    在教学的工作的领导上，我的错误性质和其他方面是一致的。我一贯地脱离实际，不了解下面文工团员们真正的需要。我对来校学习的文工团干部，只有一些笼统的、概念化的认识，觉得他们在政治上——比较强；工作经验——相当多；理论上——不系统，存在着经验主义；业务上——存在着苦闷；技术上——缺乏正规的学习，需要提高。根据这些概念化的认识，我所提出的教学任务主要是：“帮助他们总结经验，提高业务理论与技术的水平。”这里没有一个字提到政治的提高、思想的提高。所谓帮助总结经验，实际上成为一句空话。这里的经验，应该指的是向工农兵学习的经验，为工农兵服务的经验，艺术普及工作和艺术宣传工作的经验等等。在领导思想热中于关门提高的时候，这些经验是不会受到重视的。这些经验并没有认真地被帮助总结出来，成为系统的材料，并没有被集中起来，成为充实教学、改进教学的源泉。相反地，在我这个教条主义的头脑里，对于这些经验是很不尊重的，对拥有实际经验的人，一律看成是经验主义，而要以教条主义的方法，以小资产阶级的艺术观点和它进行“斗争”的，这怎么会督促我们的干部，认真地帮助他们进行总结经验，用来充实和改进我们的教学，用来当做艺术提高的基础呢？这样一来，剩下的就是业务的理论课、技术课占去了几乎全部的课程内容，这些课程也同样体现了我们关门提高的方针，因为在教学内容上，对戏剧运动现状，普及工作现状的研究和学习，譬如戏剧创作问题，戏曲改革问题、群众业余的戏剧活动等都没有占到应有的地位，研究中国戏曲遗产、研究中国民间艺术的课程，或者是不能结合实际（如中国戏曲史）或者是不系统不经常（如地方戏曲），总之是没有显出它突出的地位。而另一方面，由于我们对教学干部思想领导的薄弱，某些未经改造的教员，曾经把课堂当做宣传资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想的讲坛。所有这些，我们都应该受到谴责的。
    由于我严重地忽视政治、忽视群众对艺术的要求，艺术“为谁服务”的问题，在我的思想上没有得到根本的解决，因之在我的艺术思想上，就不能不陷于极度的混乱。因之在普及和提高的关系上，我过分地不适当地强调了提高，这就助长了轻视普及的倾向，助长了关门提高的倾向；在提高什么、如何提高的问题上，我过分地不适当地强调提高艺术性，这就助长了脱离政治、脱离生活的倾向；在提高艺术性提高业务的问题上，我过分地不适当地强调提高技术，这就助长了干部中间的技术观点和资产阶级的艺术观点；在提高技术和学习技术的问题上，我过分地不适当地强调学习西洋技术，这就助长了轻视民族遗产、盲目崇拜西洋的非爱国主义倾向；错误的领导思想形成了错误的路线，这个路线和毛主席的文艺路线一天天越离越远，最后是完全违反了毛主席的文艺路线，违反了无产阶级的思想原则。这种错误的、小资产阶级的文艺思想、小资产阶级的文艺路线曾经在中央戏剧学院、在中央戏剧学院党的组织中居于领导的地位。这就是以往在戏剧学院没有实现无产阶级的领导，对人民戏剧事业造成了巨大损失的根本原因。
    这种损失本来是可以避免的，因为在戏剧学院党内曾经有过斗争，并且有过尖锐的斗争。譬如戏剧学院在一九五一年所暴露出来的各种严重现象，一九五○年年底党内整风的时候，就有不少的同志曾经尖锐地提出过。可是我当时缺乏最起码的觉悟，忠言逆耳，许多话都听不进去。在我的小资产阶级的眼光里，把正确的意见都看成“老一套”；在我的教条主义的头脑里，把坚持正确意见的干部都一律看成“经验主义”，加之我的党性不纯，十分缺乏民主精神和谦虚谨慎的态度，主观而且自大，听不得相反的意见；高高地站在群众之上，干部之上，自以为坚持了正确的东西，以粗暴的态度对待批评，压制了民主，使错误发展到严重的地步。我的组织性纪律性非常薄弱，在党内发生了根本性方针性的争论时，也没有及时报告上级，请求指示。我用很不严肃的态度对待整风，为一九五○年的整风作了错误的小资产阶级的结论；就是这样，正确的意见没有得到发扬，错误的意见却得到了支持。
    我的错误的思想和作风，在党的统一战线工作上也造成了损害。事实证明，戏剧学院党的统一战线工作，早已产生了右的倾向，可是过去当党内同志每一次提醒的时候，我总以为我们应该防止的不是右倾而是左倾的偏向。从戏剧学院总支成立的第一天起，我就提醒全体党员应该很好地和党外人士合作，防止左倾关门主义的偏向，当时这样提出还是必要的。这以后学院吸收了大量新区的艺术家和艺术青年，这本是可喜的现象；但同时带来了各种非无产阶级的思想，需要进行批评、教育，帮助他们进行思想改造，以达到真正的团结。可是我忽视这一基本情况，一贯地强调团结而忽视斗争。在这一错误思想的支配下，从党的领导人起，就解除了思想斗争的武装。我过去长期在蒋管区进行文化界的统一战线工作，那时的情况、条件不同，加之我对统一战线理解的肤浅，就是在那个时候工作中也曾表现了右的倾向。我在目前新的情况下不能正确地执行党的统一战线政策，和以往的工作习惯有很大的关系。我和党外人士接触的时候，总是特别的讲究工作方式，讲究方式是好的，但在我却把方式代替了原则。我总害怕伤害了小资产阶级干部的自尊心，这种迁就妥协的方法，实际上是堵塞了非党干部前进的道路。当这些同志觉悟了的时候，是谁也不会感激我的。更重要的是我的文艺思想和某些非党同志的某些落后的艺术观点有了互相沟通的地方，在这种情况下，怕伤害小资产阶级，也就是怕伤害自己。可以举音乐工作做一个例子。我不懂音乐，对音乐有着一知半解的知识，这些浅薄的知识大多是接受了资产阶级的艺术教条。资产阶级的古典音乐曾在一个时期迷醉过我；带着这样的趣味和爱好，开始进入解放区的时候，对于秧歌音乐是有些格格不入的。这几年来，感情上确乎发生了一些变化；但是对资产阶级的所谓高级形式的音乐建筑，对小资产阶级的音乐情调，从来没有隔断感情上的联系。在这种情况下，要我对全院的音乐工作进行坚强的领导，对资产阶级、小资产阶级的音乐思想进行深刻的斗争，这就是很困难的。“和平鸽”是另外一个典型的例子。我对欧阳院长这个剧本有一些意见，首先在创作方法上、在风格上，在某些场面、情节的设计上是不能满意的。我的所谓帮助也偏重在这些艺术性的问题上。我没有着重对欧阳院长的创作热情进行政治上的帮助，特别没有帮助他集中群众的意见，以进行有效的修改。相反地，我
    一方面说服舞蹈团同志们上演这个剧本，一方面在党内说服大家不要提意见。等到演出以后，同志们的意见很多，而且提得很尖锐。我怕伤害了欧阳院长，一方面蒙蔽他，使他听不到这些意见，一方面制造出许多错误的理论，用来压制这些批评。这就堵塞了欧阳院长和群众的联系。这样的团结当然是庸俗的团结。事情是很明显的，由于我自己缺乏无产阶级的思想原则，和党外人士合作的时候，就不能达到有原则的团结；由于我自己在思想上没有和非无产阶级的思想划清界限，因之在统一战线工作中也划不清思想的界限；由于我自己在文艺思想上陷于混乱，也就无法帮助全院党和非党同志澄清文艺思想的混乱。
    造成我的文艺思想的严重错误和严重混乱的根本原因，主要在以下两个方面：
    第一，在我的思想深处存在着政治和艺术、普及和提高的二元论的看法。小资产阶级的艺术观点并没有自己的体系，大部分是接受了资产阶级的艺术影响。我过去长期间对资产阶级的某些文学、戏剧、音乐作品，曾经狂热过、拜倒过，虽然我所爱好的外国资产阶级社会的艺术作品，大部分是具有一定的进步性和民主性的，但是由于缺乏批判的能力（如果批判的话，也是以小资产阶级的趣味和爱好来进行批判的），这些作品中的个人力量、个人感情的夸大的描写，以及对社会阴暗面的刻划，投合了革命的小资产阶级的爱好；另一方面，对资产阶级文学作品，在今天看来是落后的某些艺术方法、艺术规律，也曾经不自觉地强固地影响了我。就是说，无形中成了资产阶级文学教条、艺术教条的俘虏。这些影响和小资产阶级的趣味、爱好结合起来，就形成一种成见，在观察文学艺术的时候，不是首先从政治、从阶级要求出发，而是从文学艺术的教条出发。经常有一套主观的牢不可破的想法，觉得怎样怎样才是文学，怎样怎样就不是；怎样怎样才是艺术，怎样怎样就不是。再就是新歌剧应该怎样怎样，新音乐应该怎样怎样，新舞蹈应该怎样怎样等等。从抽象的“应该怎样怎样”出发，而不是从实际的需要出发。如果政治内容、生活真实，和这些主观的、抽象的艺术教条发生了矛盾的时候，那是会为了教条宁肯牺牲政治内容和生活真实的。我在创作室的领导工作中所发生的错误，可以从这一点得到说明。这样在我不自觉的思想深处，就有了政治和艺术可以相互平行的看法。就是说，政治——应该是无产阶级的；文学艺术——也可以是小资产阶级的或资产阶级的。譬如一九四四年左右我在昆明工作的时候，一方面进行着反对蒋介石反动政权的激烈斗争，写了一些政治论文和
    一些政治讽刺诗，这些，在斗争中曾经起了一定的作用。但就是在这个时候，却也写了和出版了完全表现小资产阶级个人主义的落后感情的抒情诗集，自己明明知道这样做“不但有损于一个进步诗人严正的立场，而且是一个文艺战士永远的羞辱”，并且还在这个诗集的跋文中痛骂自己：“这些诗能够发表吗？这样的东西能够见人吗？这集子能够代表自己吗？狂妄的感情，偏激的诗章，空洞抽象的字句，自高自大的丑态与装腔做势的语言，那是要使人作三日呕的！”虽然如此，还认为这些诗有一定的艺术性，还是老着脸皮把它出版了。这种政治和艺术二元论的看法，自己以为在思想上已经清算过了的，实际上并没有彻底地清算。这种政治和艺术的二元论，实际上是变相的为艺术而艺术的观点，它之所以在我这个党员的文艺工作者的头脑里可以存在，乃是由于我出身于小资产阶级，革命性、斗争性不强，缺乏一种把文学艺术当做革命武器的强烈要求。我经常过分地强调艺术性，强调技巧，观察艺术作品时往往重视艺术性而忽视政治性，都可以从这一点得到说明。
    因为过分地强调艺术性，忽视政治的要求、人民的要求，因此就过分地强调提高，产生了提高和普及的二元论的看法。我对毛主席规定的“普及第
    一”的方针，从理智上是赞成的、拥护的，觉得按这个方针执行下去，就会大大发挥广大群众艺术上的创造力，就会在若干年后把我们的国家变成一个文学艺术的大花园，这一点我是感到兴奋的。但是觉得做这样的工作是别人的事情，好像和自己的关系很少似的。至于我们呢？是专门做提高工作的，做高级艺术的建设工作的，这种提高的、建设的工作，仿佛是可以不要任何雄厚基础的。我常说，我们的任务是就以往在普及基础上已经达到的成就，再予以提高一步。按照这个逻辑发展下去，明天的任务，就是把我们今天关门提高的东西再来一个提高；以后就是步步高升，升到空中楼阁，完全不管什么普及不普及了。特别是这种空中楼阁的提高，还主要是从艺术性上着眼的，至于思想内容呢？那就不太注意了。这是一种脱离人民的想法，这会把艺术和艺术家引向死路的。记得前几年在解放区农村的时候，在那样艰苦的条件下，有的音乐家因交响乐吃不开而苦闷，有的画家因不能画油画而苦闷，他们向我发牢骚，我都曾寄以同情，这说明我的一心提高，忽视普及的倾向是由来已久的。带着小资产阶级、资产阶级的艺术观点，我虽然惊叹于解放区文艺作品伟大的政治鼓动的作用，但是在艺术形式方面，特别在秧歌剧的艺术形式方面，觉得似乎太简单、太粗糙了，觉得以我们的力量，本来是可以把它搞得更好一些的；譬如说，人物形象可以更鲜明一些，音乐可以更丰富一些，唱的可以更好听一些等等。这种看法本来也不是完全错误的，错误的是从抽象的艺术教条去考虑，不顾人民的爱好，人民的欣赏习惯，以小资产阶级的急躁心理，试图作脱离实际的提高。这种想法在当时的条件下自然难以实现；进城了，干部条件和物质条件都有所不同了，这种想法又有大量的小资产阶级来支持了，于是这种片面提高的急躁心理，就发展为关门提高的具体实践。
    形成错误思想的第二个原因，同时也是更重要的原因，就是我长时期地脱离实际、脱离群众。长时期以来，我是搞所谓革命的文化工作的，接触的多半是中上层的知识分子。和这些人谈话谈得来，思想感情很容易打成一片；和劳动群众很少接触，谈话谈不来，不能打成一片。过去在蒋管区，或者也可以说，由于政治、社会条件的限制；到了解放区，住在农村里，住在小城镇上，虽然担负了行政工作，到底有了一定的接触劳动群众的机会，但自己并没有感觉到脱离群众是一个文艺工作者的致命伤，并没有充分利用一切可能的机会，刻苦地向群众学习。长时期漂浮在上层，作的是所谓文化工作、思想工作，用笔用嘴的工作，很容易造成一种错觉，以为不接触群众，不了解群众的需要，也可以照样地写文章、讲道理。久而久之，就变成革命的空谈家，不以为耻，反以为荣。长时期地从生活上、从思想上脱离实际、脱离工农兵，不懂得他们的需要，至少不能体会到他们的迫切需要，不熟悉他们的生活、趣味和爱好，加之自己思想意识上没有得到彻底的改造，文艺观念上陷于混乱，就使自己所领导的艺术工作，和群众的需要越离越远，发展了错误，而且坚持了错误。另一方面，由于长期接触到的是小资产阶级知识分子，从生活上、思想上早已和他们打成一片，懂得他们的需要，熟悉他们的生活、趣味和爱好，因而脑子里常常忘记工农兵，记得的是小资产阶级；在艺术问题上不能做工农兵的代言人，却常常做了小资产阶级的代言人。譬如说，坚持工农兵方向、坚持无产阶级思想原则，按照小资产阶级的眼光看来这是未免太“狭隘”了。小资产阶级对这点经常不满，要求“放宽尺度”。我一方面向这样的同志解释所以不能放宽尺度的理由，但是另一方面，我自己的思想深处，竟也有了同样的感觉和要求。我记得一九四八年在石家庄举行的一次华北文艺工作者代表大会上，我自己就曾经附和过这种“放宽尺度”的论调，公开作了小资产阶级的代言人。在戏剧学院工作的期间，这种思想仍然是起作用的。譬如前面已经提到的，我曾制造各种错误的论据，如关于“和平鸽”的诡辩，整风时期的诡辩，关于统一战线工作的诡辩，实际上都是做了小资产阶级的代言人，从各方面歪曲毛主席的文艺路线，从各方面坚持小资产阶级的文艺路线，不但主张放宽尺度，而且直接经手大大放宽了尺度。放宽尺度的另一个代名词，在我就叫做所谓“提高”。“放宽”也罢，“提高”也罢，客观上都是为小资产阶级打开门户、发展市场。经过延安的整风，经过毛主席的教导，解放区的文艺工作者经过思想改造，自动地把小资产阶级的后门堵上了，把一切违反工农兵利益的旁门左道堵上了，只留下一条虽然艰苦，但却是光明的大道，这就是毛主席文艺路线——工农兵方向。可是在中央戏剧学院，经过我的手，把小资产阶级、资产阶级的旁门左道，过去经过痛苦的斗争才堵上了的，又被我一个一个地打开了。并且号召同志们放胆走去，一直走到和工农兵方向完全相反的方向，走到错误的失败的地步。
    作为一个党员的文艺工作者，我是诚心诚意打算为党、为人民做些工作的；可是，由于长期严重地脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众，一向自高自大，忽视了自己的思想改造，使错误的思想可以发展到几乎不可收拾的地步，这是我以前完全没有觉察到的。自以为掌握了毛主席的文艺路线，实际是歪曲了毛主席的路线，并且以自己的比较有系统的错误的理论，阻挠了和妨害了正确的文艺路线的贯彻执行；小资产阶级的思想、作风可以发展到这样顽强的可怕的程度，至少在一个时期之内可以成为革命的文艺工作的阻力，这些，也是我过去完全没有觉察到的。这次在同志们的帮助下，初步检查出这些错误的思想、作风，开始认识到它的严重性、危害性以后，使我大吃一惊而猛省起来！我现在虽然不在戏剧学院工作，但还在其他文艺岗位上参加一些领导的工作，担子甚至比以前更重了。一年以来，我的思想上有初步的觉悟，但是离真正的觉悟还是相差很远。如果我不能彻底检查出自己的错误思想，认真地改造自己，我今后怎么能够做好自己的工作呢？因此，我诚恳地要求同志们继续帮助我。我必须痛下决心，正视自己的错误而且坚决改正这些错误，跟随同志们一同前进。（一九五二年一月十三日根据去年年终在中央戏剧学院全院大会上的报告稿写成。）
