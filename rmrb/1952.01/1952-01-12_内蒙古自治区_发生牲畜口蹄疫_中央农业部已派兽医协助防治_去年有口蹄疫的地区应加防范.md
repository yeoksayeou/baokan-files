Xinhua News Agency Report: A highly contagious livestock disease, foot-and-mouth disease, has recently broken out in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The disease initially occurred in the western part of Inner Mongolia and quickly spread to six leagues in Inner Mongolia. Cattle in Laiyuan County, Hebei Province, and Beijing have also been infected with foot-and-mouth disease. Foot-and-mouth disease is most easily contracted by cattle, sheep, camels, and pigs. Affected livestock suffer from rotten mouths and hooves and cannot work, requiring half a month to recover. The spread of this disease last spring severely hampered spring plowing.

In order to quickly prevent and control foot-and-mouth disease and strictly prevent it from spreading to other provinces and regions, the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture has dispatched many veterinarians to Inner Mongolia to assist in prevention and control, and will notify all areas that experienced the disease last year to strictly guard against recurrence. The Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture believes that foot-and-mouth disease is a very vicious livestock disease, and if it is not prevented and controlled early, it may hinder this year's spring plowing. Areas near Inner Mongolia should notify the people to reduce the transportation of cattle, sheep, and livestock products such as hides, wool, meat, and bones from Inner Mongolia. Inner Mongolia should designate livestock transportation routes at its borders with neighboring provinces and establish heavy livestock quarantine stations along the transportation lines to strictly prevent the export of diseased livestock and livestock products; neighboring areas should also set up quarantine stations to strictly prevent imports. Local quarantine stations should strictly inspect livestock, and diseased livestock should be detained and isolated. Healthy livestock should also be disinfected before being released. Trains transporting cattle, sheep, and livestock products from Inner Mongolia should be strictly inspected both at the time of departure and upon arrival at the destination. As for the areas where foot-and-mouth disease is currently prevalent, the local people's government should mobilize the people to step up prevention and control in accordance with the draft measures for the prevention and control of foot-and-mouth disease issued by the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture.

    内蒙古自治区
    发生牲畜口蹄疫
    中央农业部已派兽医协助防治
    去年有口蹄疫的地区应加防范
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：内蒙古自治区最近流行一种传染最快的牲畜病——口蹄疫。这个病开始发生在内蒙古西部地区，很快就传遍了内蒙古的六个盟。河北省涞源县和北京市的牛只也有感染口蹄疫的。口蹄疫是一种牛、羊、骆驼和猪最容易感染的病，得病的牲畜口蹄腐烂不能工作，要半个月才能恢复健康。去年春天这个病的流传曾严重地妨碍过春耕。
    为了迅速防治口蹄疫，严防它传到其他省区，中央人民政府农业部已派兽医多人前往内蒙古协助防治，并将通报各地，凡去年发生过这个病的地区应严格防范复发。中央人民政府农业部认为：口蹄病是一种很凶恶的牲畜病，如果不及早防治，便有妨碍今年春耕的可能性。凡接近内蒙古的地区，应通告人民少往内蒙古贩运牛、羊和皮、毛、肉、骨等畜产品。内蒙古在和邻省交界的地方应规定牲畜运输道，并在运输线上设立重重的牲畜检疫站，严防有病的牲畜和畜产品输出；邻区也应设检疫站，严防输入。各地检疫站检查牲畜应当严格，对有病的牲畜应当扣留隔离，对无病的也要消毒后才予放行。火车运输内蒙古的牛、羊和畜产品，在起运时和到达目的地后，都应严格检查。至于口蹄疫正在流行的地区，当地人民政府应发动人民，按照中央人民政府农业部所发的防治口蹄疫办法草案加紧防治。
