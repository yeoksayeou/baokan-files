    In the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy, Eliminate the Influence of Bourgeois Ideology on Me

    Comrade Editor: We have studied Comrade Bo Yibo's report at the cadre conferences of the Central Committee, North China Bureau, and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin. This report has given me a deeper understanding of the great significance of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    Comrade Bo Yibo instructed us that the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is essentially a struggle against the corrupt and decadent ideology of the bourgeoisie. It is a resolute counterattack against the rampant offensive launched by the bourgeoisie against the working class and the Chinese Communist Party over the past three years, suppressing this reactionary offensive and subjecting the bourgeoisie's reactionary and ugly thoughts and behaviors to political transformation and legal sanctions. Only in this way can the victory of the revolution be guaranteed. This is a serious class struggle, and we must win victory in this struggle.

    Comrade Bo Yibo also encouraged us from the two aspects of popular support and the conditions of the cadres, pointing out that we will surely achieve victory in this great struggle. All our patriotic compatriots should unite, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, in a fighting posture, bravely and confidently fighting to completely eliminate the filth and poison of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy left over from the old society.

    I am a young student in New China and a glorious member of the Communist Youth League. I must actively participate in this great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology brought to me by the old society, and contribute my own share of strength in this movement.

    在反贪污浪费反官僚主义斗争中  清除资产阶级思想对我的影响
    编辑同志：我们学习了薄一波同志在中央、华北和京津两市的干部大会上所作的报告。这个报告，使我更深刻地认识了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的伟大意义。
    薄一波同志指示我们，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，本质上是反对资产阶级腐化堕落思想的斗争，也就是对于资产阶级在三年以来向工人阶级和中国共产党所举行的猖狂进攻进行坚决的反攻，把这种反动的进攻压下去，并把资产阶级的这种反动的丑恶的思想和行为给以政治上的改造和法律上的制裁。只有这样，革命胜利才能有保证。这是一场严重的阶级斗争，我们必须在这场斗争中取得胜利。
    薄一波同志又从人民的支持和干部的条件这两方面鼓舞我们，指出我们一定能在这一伟大斗争中取得胜利。我们一切爱国同胞都应当团结起来，在毛主席领导下，以战斗的姿态，勇敢地充满信心地为彻底消灭贪污、浪费、官僚主义这些旧社会遗留下来的污毒而斗争。
    我是一个新中国的青年学生，又是光荣的青年团员。我一定要积极参加这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争，清除旧社会带给我的资产阶级思想的影响，并在这次运动中贡献出我自己的一分力量。　清华大学学生　立之
