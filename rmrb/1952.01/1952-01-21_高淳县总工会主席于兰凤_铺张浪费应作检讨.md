    Yu Lanfeng, Chairman of the Gaochun County Federation of Trade Unions
    Should be Reprimanded for Extravagance and Waste
    Editor: The Preparatory Committee of the Gaochun County Federation of Trade Unions in Southern Jiangsu Province held its first representative assembly on December 5th of last year, formally establishing the county's Federation of Trade Unions. During the preparatory work meeting, the responsible cadres of the trade union stated, "If anyone wishes to give gifts, please give items that are practical." They even designated the Education Trade Union to provide a lectern. The notice sent to the grassroots organizations of each agency's trade union also noted, "If you are so kind as to bestow congratulatory banners or gifts, please send them before the 30th." Subsequently, gifts poured in from all directions, practically forming a gift-giving campaign. On Chunxi Street, which is about one li long, the preparatory committee erected thirteen colorful arches (at the expense of each grassroots committee), and the venue's gate was also decorated with twenty electric lights. The total cost of these gifts and decorations amounted to 12 million yuan in waste.

    Before the meeting, cadres from the Gaochun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party reminded Yu Lanfeng, the chairman of the trade union, to stop these wasteful measures, but he completely ignored them, believing that this was the only way to express the "greatness" of the working class and the "solemnity" of the meeting. Under the guidance of this erroneous thinking, some trade union cadres even began to haggle over the quantity of congratulatory gifts. For example, the Gaochun County People's Government and the County Committee, in order to economize, jointly presented a red silk banner with ink writing. However, Yu Lanfeng and other cadres were dissatisfied, even saying, "This is looking down on the workers and disrespecting the workers' representative assembly; if you want to save money, you might as well not give anything at all." Afterwards, this phenomenon of extravagance and waste drew the attention of the Gaochun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Cheng Zhong, the County Committee Secretary, asked Yu Lanfeng to make a self-criticism at the County Committee meeting, but he ignored it. We believe that Yu Lanfeng should make a profound self-criticism.

### 高淳县总工会主席于兰凤  铺张浪费应作检讨

    高淳县总工会主席于兰凤
    铺张浪费应作检讨
    编辑同志：苏南高淳县总工会筹备委员会，在去年十二月五日召开首届代表大会，并正式成立县总工会。在筹备工作会议上，工会负责干部说：“如果有人送礼，请送适用的东西。”而且指定教育工会送讲演台一具。在发给各机关工会基层组织的通知上也注称：“如蒙惠赐贺旗贺礼，请于三十日前送来。”此后，礼物纷纷从各方送到，简直形成一个送礼运动。在约一里路长的淳溪街上，筹备委员会扎了十三个彩门（费用由各基层委员会负责），会场的大门也装了二十只电灯。这些礼品及装置费用共浪费一千二百万元。
    会前，中共高淳县委员会干部曾提醒工会主席于兰凤，要他停止这些浪费措施，但他毫不理睬，认为这样作才算表示工人阶级的“伟大”和会议的“隆重”。在这种错误思想的指导下，有些工会干部竟计较起贺礼多少来了。比如高淳县人民政府和县委为了节约，合送一面用墨水写的红绸布的旗子。但于兰凤和其他干部就感到不满，竟说：“这样作是瞧不起工人，对工人代表大会不尊重；既要节约，就索性不要送好了。”事后，这种铺张浪费的现象引起了中共高淳县委员会的重视。县委书记程中要于兰凤在县委会议上作检讨，他竟置之不理。我们认为于兰凤应作深刻检讨。
