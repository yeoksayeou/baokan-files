The 704 peasant households in Jinggangshan, the old revolutionary base area, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the eve of the New Year to congratulate him, reporting on their good life after liberation and the situation of carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

    We are 704 peasant households living in Jinggangshan, the revolutionary hometown. The third New Year of New China has arrived. Seeing the increasingly better life, we have a lot to say to you.

    Chairman Mao, since you led the Red Army away from Jinggangshan, the counter-revolutionary tyrant Xiao Jiabi carried out crazy burning and killing here. Two-thirds of the people in Da and Xiao Wujing (village names) were sacrificed. The White bandits (referring to the Chiang bandit troops) often came to burn, kill, and loot. We suffered unspeakable pain. After the liberation of Jinggangshan in the autumn of the year before last, we returned to your embrace and received the respect and care of the People's Government and the broad masses. In the past two years, the Central People's Government, the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, and the Ji'an Prefectural Commissioner's Office have successively organized visiting groups to comfort us. Soviet friends also traveled long distances to see us. At the same time, we also received letters of condolence from the people of Yunnan, Shaanxi, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. How excited we were!

    In the past, Jinggangshan was a place with barren land and poor people, with only 30 to 40 percent harvest every year. This spring, the land reform was completed in the Jinggangshan area. The People's Government successively allocated more than 100,000 catties of comfort grain and agricultural loans. We not only had food, but also bought 39 head of cattle, more than 40 pieces of farm tools, and a lot of fertilizer. All 3,800 mu of paddy fields in the entire mountainous area have achieved "two plows, three harrows, and three weedings," and a total of more than 700,000 catties of lime have been applied. The newly reclaimed 268 mu of wasteland have also been planted with rice and sweet potatoes. This spring, we repaired water conservancy projects and organized mutual aid organizations to protect the green seedlings in summer. Therefore, we achieved a bumper harvest this autumn that had not been seen in sixty years. The average yield of rice per mu in the entire area was 320 catties (doubled compared to before liberation). The rice fields of Luo Longmao, a labor model in Xiazhuang Township, had a maximum yield of 520 catties per mu. Everyone said: Thanks to Chairman Mao's care, we have a hundredfold harvest this year. After the bumper harvest, many families added cattle and farm tools, bought cloth, repaired houses, and held weddings. Luo Longmao, a peasant in Xiazhuang Township, had nothing before liberation. This year, he harvested more than 70 dan of rice, bought cattle and farm tools, and also bought more than 20 zhang of cloth. All five members of his family have changed into new cotton clothes. The two brothers Chen Hesheng's family in Liping Village were poorly clad all year round before liberation and always covered themselves with straw raincoats in winter. This year, they also made new clothes and new quilts. In addition, we have also established cooperatives, built schools, and organized reading groups. Jinggangshan has only produced study grants since ancient times and has never run a school. Now, children and old people have books to read.

    On December 3rd, Comrade Liu Xinlin, who participated in the National Day observation ceremony in Beijing from our region, returned and held a meeting to convey your call for strengthening the resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production, and practicing strict economy. We immediately started a discussion and formulated a specific plan for increasing production and practicing economy. Many families have revised the patriotic pact according to your meaning. We have decided to increase rice production by 40 catties per mu next year compared to this year. This winter and next spring, we will increase the income of 140,000 catties of rice from sideline production such as digging medicinal materials, carrying wood, digging bamboo shoots, raising pigs, and raising chickens. At the same time, we will also launch a campaign to practice economy. In order to complete next year's production increase plan, all the paddy fields in Dajing Township have been winter-plowed, and winter crops such as rapeseed have also been planted in mountainous areas. In addition, Dajing Township has also begun to repair water conservancy projects, and every household is accumulating fertilizer and manure, burning lime, and preparing for next year's spring plowing. In order to strengthen political study and oppose complacency, in the future, people's schools and reading groups will read newspapers at least three times a week; the militia will strengthen winter defense and sentry work to ensure security in the mountainous areas.

    Chairman Mao: In the future, we will definitely follow your instructions, work hard to increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, promote the revolutionary tradition of the old base area, and build our motherland. We wish you good health.

### 井冈山农民写信向毛主席庆贺新年  保证发扬老区人民的革命传统做好增产节约工作

    井冈山农民写信向毛主席庆贺新年
    保证发扬老区人民的革命传统做好增产节约工作
    革命老根据地井冈山上的七百零四户农民，在新年前夕写信向毛主席贺年，报告他们解放后的好光景和开展增产节约运动的情形。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们是住在革命故乡井冈山上的七百零四户农民。新中国的第三个新年来到了，眼看着越过越好的光景，我们心里有许多话要向您说。
    毛主席，自从您带领着红军离开井冈山以后，反革命大恶霸萧家璧在这里进行了疯狂的烧杀，大小五井（村名）的人民牺牲了三分之二。白狗子（指蒋匪军）又经常来烧杀抢劫，我们受的痛苦说也说不完。前年秋天井冈山解放后，我们回到了您的怀抱，受到人民政府和广大群众的尊敬和关怀。二年来，中央人民政府、新民主主义青年团中央委员会、江西省人民政府、吉安专署接二连三地组织访问团来慰问我们，苏联朋友也长途跋涉地来看我们。同时，我们还收到了云南、陕西、南京、上海等地人民寄来的慰问信。我们多兴奋啊！
    在从前，井冈山是个地瘠民贫的地方，年年只有三四成的收成。今年春天，井冈山区完成了土地改革，人民政府先后拨了十几万斤的慰问粮及农业贷款，我们不仅有了口粮，还买了三十九条耕牛、四十多件农具和许多肥料。全山区三千八百多亩稻田，都做到了“二犁三耙三除草”，共下了七十多万斤石灰。新开垦的二百六十八亩荒田荒地，也全部种上了水稻和红薯。今年春天我们修了水利，夏天组织了互助护青的组织。因此，今年秋天获得了六十年来没有的大丰收，全区每亩稻田平均收稻谷三百二十斤（比解放前增加一倍），下庄乡劳动模范罗龙茂的稻田，每亩最高产量达五百二十斤。大家都说：感谢毛主席的关怀，今年百种百收。在丰收以后，许多人家都添置耕牛农具，买布、修房，办喜事。下庄乡农民罗龙茂，在解放前什么都没有，今年收了七十多石稻谷，买了耕牛、农具，还买了二十几丈布，全家五口都换上了新棉衣。黎坪村陈和生兄弟两家，解放前一年四季衣不蔽体，总是盖蓑衣过冬，今年也添做了新衣新被。此外，我们还办了合作社，兴建了学校，组织了读报组。井冈山自古以来只出过学捐，没有办过学堂。现在，儿童、老头子都有书读了。
    十二月三日我区参加国庆节观礼的柳辛林同志从北京回来，开会传达了您关于加强抗美援朝、增加生产、厉行节约的号召。我们马上展开了讨论，并订出了增产节约的具体计划。许多人家已经根据您的意思修订了爱国公约。我们决定明年每亩稻田要比今年增产稻谷四十斤。今冬明春，要从多挖药材、扛木头、挖竹笋、养猪、养鸡等副业生产中增加十四万斤稻谷的收入。同时，还要开展节约运动。为了完成明年增产计划，大井乡的稻田已全部进行了冬耕，在山区地方还种了油菜等冬季作物。此外，大井乡并已开始修水利，家家户户积肥储粪、烧石灰，做好明年春耕的准备工作。为了加强政治学习，反对麻痹松劲思想，在今后，民校和读报组至少三天读报一次；民兵要加强冬防放哨工作，确保山区治安。
    毛主席：今后我们一定遵照您的指示，努力增产节约，以支持中国人民志愿军，发扬老根据地人民的革命传统，建设我们的祖国。祝您身体健康。
