The case of Cui Mingqing, head of the business section of Wuhan Department Store, Lu Jichang, business section chief of the Second Wholesale Department, and four others collectively engaging in embezzlement, and colluding with Teng Zhenlu, manager of Hankou Wuwenji Paper Store, and Kang Shanheng, an employee of the store, causing a loss of 1,790 million yuan in state property, has been prosecuted by the Wuhan People's Procuratorate.

Cui Mingqing, of landlord origin, was the head of the business section of Wuhan Department Store. He joined the Kuomintang in Shanxi. In 1942, he infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and worked at the Huafengxiang Store, a publicly owned store in the Taihang Military Region. He was discovered by the organization for embezzling public funds and was punished and educated. Later, he worked at the Shijiazhuang Publicly Owned Bank and was purged for embezzlement. In 1949, Cui Mingqing seized the opportunity to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks again and was assigned as the business section chief of the Wuhan Salt Company. During his tenure, he sold commercial information to private merchants Zhu Xingcai, Zhang Liancheng, etc., predicting the rise and fall of prices the next day, and received bribes such as mosquito nets, cloth, cigarettes, watches, and 500,000 yuan in Renminbi.

In October 1949, when Cui Mingqing and Dai Xingsong, a clerk of the Wuhan Department Store's business section, went to Tianjin to purchase goods with funds, they colluded with Yang Xiuwen, manager of the Tianjin private Lifeng Store (Yang originally worked at the Huafengxiang Store in the Taihang Military Region and was purged for making mistakes). They arbitrarily entrusted the purchasing task to Lifeng Store (which should have been done through the Tianjin Trust Company according to regulations), pre-paid more than 200 million yuan in payment, and Yang delayed paying the seller's price, depositing it in the bank, and illegally profiting 28,222,300 yuan. Lifeng Store also took the opportunity of this purchase to collect commissions and bribe Cui Mingqing with gold rings, leather shoes, quilt linings, etc., and paid Cui Mingqing more than 3 million yuan in small amounts. In Tianjin, Cui Mingqing entrusted merchant Li Fuqing to purchase rubber shoes, wool, bicycle inner and outer tires, etc. Li Fuqing forged invoices from Fuyuan Store, raising the price of all purchased goods, and seized illegal profits of 12 million yuan. He entrusted Lifeng Store to entrust Li Maoyuan, manager of Juyuan Store, to purchase 5,000 bolts of cloth. Li Maoyuan increased the price of each bolt from 800 yuan to 3,000 yuan, causing the Wuhan Department Store to lose 10 million yuan. In Tianjin, Cui Mingqing also colluded with rogue Wang Shanting, entrusting him to purchase a large number of watches, stationery, wool, etc., and engaged in malfeasance. Cui Mingqing embezzled a total of 9.6 million yuan during the period of purchasing materials in Tianjin. In May 1950, Wang Shanting went to Hankou, carrying 2,395 dozens of fake monk's cap emery cloth and 553 dozens of paper glue collars. According to the price of emery cloth in Hankou at that time, each dozen was no more than 10,000 yuan, and the price of paper glue collars in Tianjin was 2,000 yuan per dozen. Cui Mingqing increased the price of emery cloth by 5,500 yuan per dozen and the price of paper glue collars by 5,000 yuan per dozen, purchasing them all. The total price increase caused the Wuhan Department Store to lose 15,937,500 yuan.

From 1949 to 1950, a certain ordnance factory in North China sent personnel to Hankou to purchase wood, and entrusted Cui Mingqing to assist. Cui directly entrusted Yang Ziqing, the father of Yang Zhilan, a female employee in the section, to purchase it in Yiyang without the introduction of a trust company. This enabled Yang and others to obtain a handling fee of 35 million yuan. During the period of the purchase, Cui Mingqing also arbitrarily pre-paid Yang a handling fee of 20 million yuan from the ordnance factory, using it to purchase wooden boats, houses, furniture, and clothing for the Yang family, totaling 31,365,000 yuan. In addition to the above-mentioned 20 million yuan that had been deducted by the ordnance factory when settling the account, Cui Mingqing used embezzled funds to pay an additional 11,365,000 yuan to show "care" for Yang Zhilan.

From November 28, 1950, to August 3, 1951, Wuhan Department Store sold a total of 115,714 jin of scrap paper, package cones, and straw rope wood cores to Hankou private Wuwenji Paper Store, totaling more than 100 million yuan. Cui Mingqing deducted 18,995,500 yuan from public funds, of which 184,000 yuan was given to Shi Guoliang, head of the processing and purchasing section of the Wuhan Department Store's business section, and the remaining 18,811,500 yuan was all embezzled by Cui Mingqing.

In April 1951, the Wuhan Department Store signed a paper cutting processing contract with Wuwenji Paper Store. Cui Mingqing increased the cutting paper wage from 5,000 yuan per ream to 5,500 yuan. The processing period was half a year, totaling 60,000 reams, with a total increase of 30 million yuan. Kang Shanheng of Wuwenji Paper Store bribed Cui Mingqing with 15 million yuan. In the winter of 1950, Cui Mingqing borrowed more than 3 million yuan and 200 sheets of newspaper from the store through Kang Shanheng.

Cui Mingqing used his position and power to solicit loans from private merchants and purchase clothing on credit, totaling more than 1.2 million yuan.

In 1949, Cui Mingqing used his authority and embezzled funds to purchase goods at low prices, hoarding them for price increases, and seeking personal gain. For example, he purchased eight dozens of rubber shoes from "Houcheng" and "Tianran" department stores at 200,000 yuan per dozen, while the market price was 240,000 yuan. He hoarded them for more than 20 days and still entrusted "Houcheng" to sell them at 480,000 yuan per dozen, gaining illegal profits of 2,240,000 yuan. In total, Cui Mingqing directly embezzled and spent funds of unknown origin totaling 100,326,000 yuan. Some stolen goods, such as gold rings and uniform materials, have not been converted into monetary amounts. In addition, unscrupulous merchants colluded with Cui Mingqing to engage in malfeasance, damaging state property of 117,160,000 yuan.

Teng Zhenlu, manager of Hankou private Wuwenji Paper Store, used speculative methods to operate the business, created false accounts, concealed income, and used huge sums of money to bribe cadres. He often used the name of a merchant, forged seals and invoices, purchased and sold goods to facilitate capital withdrawal and off-the-books capital activities. In March 1950, Wuwenji Paper Store accepted the Wuhan Department Store's commission to process and cut 6,037 rolls of paper, and successively stole and sold 280 reams of newsprint, causing the state to lose 112 million yuan. In addition, it stole approximately 34 reams of glazed paper and newsprint from the company, worth 13.6 million yuan. During the inspection, Wuwenji Paper Store tore up 18 reams of newsprint and glazed paper, worth 7.2 million yuan, in order to mix the previously stolen 34 reams of paper into the scrap paper report in an attempt to conceal the theft. Wuwenji Paper Store bribed cadres of the Wuhan Department Store to buy paper that could be cut into halves or quarters at low prices, and cut the scrap paper into small pieces or sold it directly as scrap paper, reaping huge profits, causing the Wuhan Department Store to lose more than 100 million yuan.

The Wuhan Department Store signed a packaging contract with Wuwenji Paper Store, and Wuwenji Paper Store falsely reported costs, defrauding the Wuhan Department Store of more than 150,092,000 yuan.

Wuwenji Paper Store bribed Wuhan Department Store cadres Cui Mingqing, Lu Jichang, etc., to purchase large quantities of paper at low prices, and used the company's name to purchase paper at allocated prices and sell it at high prices, gaining huge profits of more than 52 million yuan.

The total amount of direct tax evasion by Wuwenji Paper Store was 877,771,8964 yuan. The total amount of stolen and damaged state property was 605,381,670 yuan.

Lu Jichang, business section chief of the Second Wholesale Department of Wuhan Department Store, received rebates of 1,394,700 yuan when he was sent to Shanghai by the company with Wu Bugao and Yi Diwen in 1949 to purchase goods. The three divided it equally. Lu Jichang received gifts from merchants worth 3,613,500 yuan, and separately embezzled a rebate of 3,654,000 yuan with Wu Bugao. He purchased a large number of daily necessities such as "four-in-one" soap in Shanghai, transported them to Hankou for sale, and received 15,961,200 yuan, most of which was embezzled by Lu Jichang alone.

In November 1950, when Lu Jichang was the operations section chief, he colluded with Liu Bingyao, the price section chief, and Kang Shanheng of Wuwenji Paper Store, selling a large number of slightly damaged Daolin paper in stock at half the price of good paper. Wuwenji Paper Store resold it at a high price, causing the Wuhan Department Store to lose 95,224,400 yuan. The difference between the selling price and the purchase price of Wuwenji Paper Store was more than 160 million yuan. Lu Jichang received a bribe of 16 million yuan, Liu Bingyao received a bribe of 11 million yuan, and Kang Shanheng received 3 million yuan.

In 1950, Lu Jichang received a bribe of 5.5 million yuan from Wuwenji Paper Store for selling scrap paper. In 1951, when he was the business section chief of the Second Wholesale Department, he received bribes of 3.8 million yuan for selling damaged paper to Wuwenji Paper Store and Taihe Bookstore.

In mid-1950, Lu Jichang stole 10 reams of newsprint from the company and received 2.8 million yuan, which Kang Shanheng helped sell. At the end of the year, he borrowed 2 million yuan from Wuwenji Paper Store in the name of needing money for the New Year, which was paid through Kang Shanheng and has not been returned.

Lu Jichang colluded with Kang Shanheng to steal and use the names of public agencies to purchase allocated paper. For example, on February 20th of last year, the supply price of paper to private merchants was 380,000 yuan per ream, with a difference of 60,600 yuan per ream, causing the Wuhan Department Store to lose 36,360,000 yuan. Lu Jichang received a bribe of 3 million yuan from Wuwenji Paper Store, and Kang Shanheng received 3 million yuan.

In February 1951, the company's 60-pound book paper price was listed low, and private merchants rushed to buy it. On the 23rd, the company notified the suspension of sales, but Lu Jichang did not strictly implement the instructions and continued to sell it at the price of the 22nd, causing the company to lose 29,520,000 yuan. Lu Jichang often ate and drank at Zhenchang and Dachang glass shops, leaking the company's business secrets, causing these two glass shops to take the opportunity to hoard and manipulate the market price of glass.

In the spring of 1950, the Second Sales Department of Wuhan Department Store had more than 20 pairs of transparent triangles in stock, originally priced at 20,000 yuan per pair, which was very different from the market price. Liu Bingyao was responsible for pricing, but instead of raising the price, he colluded with Lu Jichang to invest and purchase them at the original price. In one transaction, each pair sold for 80,000 to 100,000 yuan, and Lu Jichang and Liu Bingyao each embezzled 600,000 yuan.

Lu Jichang embezzled a total of 48,739,600 yuan.

Kang Shanheng, a business clerk of Wuwenji Paper Store, was cunning and colluded with Wuhan Department Store cadres Cui Mingqing, Lu Jichang, Liu Bingyao, Shi Guoliang, etc., and received illegal property totaling 7,970,000 yuan. In June 1951, Kang Shanheng stole 6 reams of newsprint from the company and received more than 2 million yuan; on July 12, he stole 12 reams of western newsprint with return delivery notes and received more than 4 million yuan, causing the Wuhan Department Store to lose 7.2 million yuan (4.28 million yuan has been recovered). After Cui Mingqing's embezzlement case was discovered, Kang also instigated Liu Bingyao and Lu Jichang to refuse to confess.

Dai Xingsong, an employee of Wuhan Department Store, often engaged in private business for Cui Mingqing. In 1949, when he followed Cui to Tianjin to purchase materials, he purchased expensive and difficult-to-sell materials such as leather jackets, felt hats, blankets, and woolen cloth from private merchants without going through the trust company, embezzling public funds and accepting bribes from merchants.

Dai Xingsong embezzled a total of 13.8 million yuan. After reflecting for several months, he still tried to evade the facts of the crime.

Liu Bingyao, an employee of Wuhan Department Store, managed pricing and, taking advantage of his position, colluded with Lu Jichang to sell 255 reams of Daolin paper, receiving a bribe of 11 million yuan, plus 600,000 yuan embezzled from the triangle purchase, totaling 11.6 million yuan.

Wu Bugao, business section chief of the Wuchang Sales Department of Wuhan Department Store, embezzled public funds totaling 10,174,900 yuan in 1949 when purchasing in Shanghai, by depositing public funds in private factories to obtain interest or delaying payment.

Shi Guoliang, head of the processing and purchasing section of the Wuhan Department Store's business section, was influenced by Cui Mingqing and, from January to June 1950, embezzled a total of 4,184,000 yuan by selling the company's scrap paper.

The above-mentioned six cadres of Wuhan Department Store embezzled a total of 191,759,000 yuan. Ten other cadres with lighter criminal circumstances embezzled 8,817,000 yuan. Wuwenji Paper Store damaged state property of 605,381,670 yuan and evaded taxes of 877,771,8964 yuan, totaling more than 1,483,100,000 yuan; other unscrupulous merchants damaged state property of more than 110 million yuan.

The above totals a loss to the state of more than 1,794,240,000 yuan.

    罪犯崔明卿等侵蚀国家财产近十八亿元
    武汉市百货公司业务科长崔明卿、第二批发部业务股长陆继昌等六人集体进行贪污，并和汉口邬文记纸行经理滕镇鲁及该行职员康善衡等共同舞弊，使国家财产损失十七亿九千多万元一案，已由武汉市人民检察署提起公诉。
    崔明卿，地主成份，武汉市百货公司业务科长，曾在山西加入国民党，一九四二年，混入革命阵营，在太行军区公营华丰祥货栈工作，曾因挪用公款，被组织发觉，受到惩处和教育；继在石家庄公营钱庄工作，因贪污而被清洗。一九四九年崔明卿又乘机混入革命队伍，被派任武汉市盐业公司业务股长。在职期间，曾向私商朱星彩、张连城等出卖商情，预告隔日涨跌牌价，得贿礼蚊帐、布匹、香烟、手表等物和人民币五十万元。
    一九四九年十月，崔明卿和武汉市百货公司业务科员戴行松携款赴天津采购货物时，和天津私营利丰货栈经理杨绣文勾结（杨原在太行军区华丰祥货栈工作，因犯错误被清洗）。擅自把采购任务委托利丰货栈办理（照规定应通过天津信托公司），预支货款两亿多元，由杨经手迟付卖方货价，存入银行，非法获利二千八百二十二万三千元。利丰货栈也借这笔代购，从中索取佣金，贿赠崔明卿金戒指、皮鞋、被里等物，并零星付给崔明卿三百多万元。崔明卿在天津委托行商李福庆代购胶鞋、毛线、自行车内外胎等物。李福庆伪造福源货栈发票，提高全部代购货价，从中攫取非法利益一千二百万元。他委托利丰货栈转托聚源货栈经理李茂源购布五千匹，李茂源把每匹布加价由八百元到三千元，使武汉市百货公司损失一千万元。崔明卿在天津又勾结流氓王善亭，委托代购大批手表、文具、毛线之类，从中舞弊。崔明卿在天津采购物资时期共贪污九百六十万元。一九五○年五月间王善亭到汉口，携带伪牌僧帽铁砂布二千三百九十五打，纸胶领五百五十三打等冷背货色。按当时汉口市铁砂布价，每打不过一万元，纸胶领天津价每打二千元，崔明卿把铁砂布每打加价五千五百元，纸胶领每打加价五千元，全部购进。两项加价，总计使武汉市百货公司损失一千五百九十三万七千五百元。
    一九四九年到一九五○年间，华北某兵工厂派员到汉口采购木料，托崔明卿协助，崔不经信托公司介绍就直接委托科内女职员杨志岚的父亲杨子清等去宜阳代购。使杨等从中获取手续费三千五百万元。代购期间崔明卿又擅自由兵工厂代杨预支手续费二千万元，为杨家购置木船、房屋、家具衣物等项，共用去三千一百三十六万五千元。除上述二千万元已由兵工厂结帐时扣还外，崔明卿又以贪污款代为垫用一千一百三十六万五千元，表示对杨志岚的
    “照顾”。
    自一九五○年十一月二十八日到一九五一年八月三日，武汉市百货公司卖给汉口私营邬文记纸行碎纸、包皮筒子、草绳木心共计十一万五千七百一十四斤，合价一亿多元，崔明卿从中克扣公款一千八百九十九万五千五百元，其中除给武汉市百货公司业务科加工采购股长施国梁十八万四千元，余一千八百八十一万一千五百元全为崔明卿所侵吞。
    一九五一年四月，武汉市百货公司与邬文记纸行签订切纸加工合约，崔明卿把每令切纸工资由五千元提为五千五百元，加工期半年，共六万令，总计提高三千万元，邬文记纸行康善衡给崔明卿行贿一千五百万元。一九五○年冬，崔明卿经康善衡向该行索借三百多万元，报纸二百张。
    崔明卿挟其职权势力，向私商索借款项，赊欠衣物，总计值一百二十多万元。
    一九四九年间，崔明卿曾利用职权，以贪污所得款项，低价购进货物，囤积待涨，牟取私利。如向
    “厚成”和“天然”两百货号购进胶鞋八打，每打市价二十四万元，以二十万元购进，囤积了二十多天，仍委托“厚成”售出，每打四十八万元，获得不法利润二百二十四万元。总计崔明卿直接贪污和花用来历不明的款项共一亿零三百二十六万多元。部分赃物例如金戒指、制服料等，尚未折成金额计入。另外，不法商人勾结崔明卿共同舞弊，损害国家财产一亿一千七百一十六万多元。
    汉口私营邬文记纸行经理滕镇鲁，利用投机方法，经营商业；造假帐，隐匿收益，用巨款贿赂干部，经常假借行商名义，伪造图章发票，购销货物，便利抽资及帐外资金活动，一九五○年三月，邬文记纸行接受市百货公司委托加工切裁卷筒纸六千零三十七筒，先后从中窃取盗卖白报纸二百八十令，使国家损失一亿一千二百万元。此外并窃取公司有光纸、白报纸约计三十四令，值款一千三百六十万元。在检查期间，邬文记纸行撕毁白报纸及有光纸十八令，值价七百二十万元，目的在于把前项窃取的三十四令纸张混数报入碎纸，以图掩饰。邬文记纸行以贿赂武汉市百货公司干部，低价买进可以切成对开或四开的纸张，把碎纸切成小开或直接以碎纸卖出，获取暴利，致使武汉市百货公司损失一亿元以上。
    武汉市百货公司与邬文记纸行订立打件合约，邬文记纸行虚报成本，骗取武汉市百货公司一亿五千零九十二万多元。
    邬文记纸行贿赂武汉市百货公司干部崔明卿、陆继昌等低价购得大批纸张，并利用公司名义套购纸张，高价出售，获得暴利五千二百多万元。
    邬文记纸行直接漏税总数为八亿七千七百七十一万八千九百六十四元。盗取损害国家财产总数为六亿零五百三十八万一千六百七十元。
    武汉市百货公司第二批发部业务股长陆继昌，在一九四九年由公司派同武步高、易迪文到上海采购货物，曾收受回扣一百三十九万四千七百元，三人平分了。陆继昌收受商人赠送物品折价三百六十一万三千五百元，又另与武步高二人贪污一笔回扣三百六十五万四千元。在上海购进“四合一”香皂等大批日用品，运到汉口销售，得款一千五百九十六万一千二百元，本利大部由陆继昌一人贪污。
    一九五○年十一月，陆继昌任经营股长时，和物价股长刘炳耀、邬文记纸行康善衡内外勾串，把库存的轻微残破的大批道林纸照好纸价五折出售。邬文记纸行转手高价出售，使武汉市百货公司损失九千五百二十二万四千元。邬文记纸行卖价减去买价差额一亿六千多万元。陆继昌从中得贿一千六百万元，刘炳耀得贿一千一百万元，康善衡分得三百万元。
    陆继昌在一九五○年经手卖出碎纸接受邬文记纸行贿赂五百五十万元。一九五一年在第二批发部任业务股长时，经手卖出破损纸张给邬文记纸行和泰和书局，共接受贿赂三百八十万元。
    一九五○年中陆继昌盗卖公司白报纸十令，得款二百八十万元，由康善衡代为销出。年底又以过年需款为名向邬文记纸行索借二百万元，由康善衡经手付给，一直没有归还。
    陆继昌勾结康善衡盗用公家机关名义，套购配售纸张。如去年二月二十日对私商供应纸价每令三十八万元，每令差价六万零六百元，使武汉市百货公司损失三千六百三十六万元。陆继昌由邬文记纸行取贿三百万元，康善衡得三百万元。
    一九五一年二月，公司六十磅书籍纸牌价挂低，私商抢购，二十三日公司通知停售，陆继昌没有严格执行指示，仍然照二十二日的牌价出售。使公司损失二千九百五十二万元，陆继昌时常到振昌、大昌玻璃号内吃喝，泄漏公司业务机密，致这两个玻璃号乘机囤积居奇，操纵市场玻璃价格。
    一九五○年春，武汉市百货公司第二门市部存有透明三角板二十多副，原定价每副两万元，与市价相差很大。刘炳耀担负定价责任，不但不提高定价，反而勾结陆继昌出资按原价购出。一转手之间，每副售价八万到十万元，陆继昌与刘炳耀从中各贪污六十万元。
    陆继昌总计贪污四千八百七十三万九千六百元。
    康善衡为邬文记纸行业务员，素性奸狡，和武汉市百货公司干部崔明卿、陆继昌、刘炳耀、施国梁等串通舞弊，从中分得不法财物共七百九十七万元。一九五一年六月间，康善衡盗卖公司白报纸六令，得款二百多万；七月十二日，以回笼提单又盗卖西报纸十二令，得款四百多万，使武汉市百货公司损失七百二十万元（已追回四百二十八万元），崔明卿等贪污案被发觉后，康并唆使刘炳耀、陆继昌坚不坦白。
    武汉市百货公司职员戴行松，经常为崔明卿私人经营商业。一九四九年随崔到天津采购物资时，不通过信托公司，擅自向私商采购皮夹克、呢帽、毛毯、呢绒等高贵难销物资，从中贪污公款，接受商人贿赂。
    戴行松总计贪污一千三百八十万元。反省数月仍企图逃避犯罪事实。
    武汉市百货公司职员刘炳耀管理定价工作，借他职务上的便利，和陆继昌勾结出售道林纸二百五十五令，受贿一千一百万元，连同套购三角板贪污六十万元，共计一千一百六十万元。
    武汉市百货公司武昌门市部业务股长武步高，一九四九年在上海采购时，先后以公款存入私营厂商得拆息或迟付货款等方式，从中贪污公款一千零一十七万四千九百元。
    武汉市百货公司业务科加工采购股股长施国梁受崔明卿影响，自一九五○年一月起至六月止，经手卖出公司碎纸，共计贪污四百一十八万四千元。
    上述武汉市百货公司干部六人，共贪污一亿九千一百七十五万九千多元。其他犯罪情节较轻的干部十人，贪污八百八十一万七千元。邬文记纸行损害国家财产六亿零五百三十八万一千六百七十元，偷税八亿七千七百七十一万八千九百六十四元，两项共计十四亿八千三百一十万余元；其他不法商人损害国家财产一亿一千多万元。
