    As the Lunar New Year Approaches, All Regions Should Pay Attention to Preventing Extravagance and Waste
    Editor: Recently, the use of items related to superstition in rural areas of Qidong County, northern Jiangsu, has become very serious. The reason is that some monks and Taoists, in order to do more business, spread rumors that "after the New Year, the government will not allow religious services to be held," and many farmers believed it and did "Shifu" (burning memorial tablets for the deceased after three years, indicating that incense will no longer be burned for worship). Some farmers who had no money specifically borrowed money or sold houses and fields to do "Shifu." For example, Yuan Bangda, a farmer in Yiyong Village, Weijiao District, sold 2.4 mu of land to do "Shifu"; Zhang Lushi, a farmer in Ziyou Village, sold a house to do a service for her son. Furthermore, in Zhongming Village, Haifu District, a farmer surnamed Zhang committed suicide because he was heavily in debt from doing "Shifu" and could not repay it. We investigated in Tuanjie Village, Weijiao District, and found that out of more than 130 households in the whole village, 10 households were doing "Shifu," with an average cost of 2 million yuan per household. Considering the whole county, the amount of waste is staggering. If we estimate that 7 households in each village do "Shifu," then all 953 villages in the county will waste more than 13.3 billion yuan. This money could buy more than 133,000 head of cattle, with 14 head for each village; it could buy 87 tractors; it could buy 9 fighter planes.

    Some rural cadres not only do not stop this superstitious waste, but also do it themselves. For example, Qian Buyun, a village cadre in Tai'an Township, Huilong District, did "Shifu" for his father-in-law, and even competed with his brother-in-law to save face, resulting in the consumption of 1,000 jin of grain. Also, Yang Lifa, an instructor in this township, spoke eloquently at a mass meeting: "We must respond to Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice economy," but privately did "Shifu" for his father, also consuming more than 1,000 jin of grain.

    The Qidong County Committee of the Communist Party of China has paid attention to correcting this deviation, and pointed out that as the Lunar New Year is approaching, many people will definitely buy incense, candles, and paper money, or host banquets, which are unnecessary expenses and should be dissuaded through persuasion and education; and called on all farmers in the county to strive to save 20 jin of grain per household during the New Year, so as to invest more funds in production.

    I believe that rural cadres in all regions should quickly and thoroughly publicize the principles of increasing production and practicing economy, and avoid such superstitious waste.

### 农历年节已近各地应注意防止铺张浪费

    农历年节已近各地应注意防止铺张浪费
    编辑同志：最近苏北启东县农村中用于迷信上的东西很严重。原因是有些和尚、道士为了多做生意，造谣说“过年后，政府不准做斋事了”，许多农民信以为真，纷纷大做“释服”（即人死三年后，请和尚道士烧去牌位，表示平日不再烧香供奉）。有的农民无钱，特地借债或卖屋卖田来做斋。如圩角区义勇村农民袁邦达卖去二亩四分地来做“释服”；自由村农妇张鲁氏卖去一间房子替儿子做斋。又如海伏区中明村有个姓张的农民因做斋负了一身债，无法归还，竟因此自杀。我们曾在圩角区团结村调查，全村一百三十多户就有十家做斋事的，平均一家要用去二百万元。以全县来说，这笔浪费数字就很惊人了。如以每村七家做斋计算，全县九百五十三个村就要浪费一百三十三亿元多。这笔钱拿来买耕牛可买十三万三千多头，每村可得十四头；拿来买拖拉机，可买到八十七架；拿来买战斗机，可买九架。
    有些农村干部对于这种迷信浪费的现象，不但不制止，并且自己也做。如汇龙区太安乡一个村干部叫钱步云，给他老丈人做“释服”，还与他妻舅争面子，结果化了一千斤粮食。又这个乡指导员杨礼发，在群众大会上说得很堂皇：“要响应毛主席号召，增产节约”，私下却给他父亲做“释服”，也化去一千多斤粮食。
    中共启东县委员会已注意纠正这种偏向，并指出目前接近农历年节，一定有很多人买香烛纸箔或办酒请客，这是不必要的化费，应即说服教育予以劝阻；并号召全县农民争取在年节时每家节约二十斤粮食，以便把更多的资金投入到生产中去。
    我以为，各地农村干部都应迅速深入宣传增产节约道理，避免发生这种迷信浪费现象。
