    ▲ According to statistics from the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union, cooperatives throughout the province have already distributed new-style agricultural tools, fertilizers, and pesticides worth over 15.2 billion yuan to their members. The various means of production that cooperatives throughout the province are preparing to transport to rural areas before spring plowing include: 10,000 new-style agricultural tools such as walking plows and铡 grass machines, more than 13,360 waterwheels, more than 33,500 tons of fertilizers such as fertilizer powder and bone fertilizer, 274 tons of pesticides, and more than 60,000 pieces of sprayers and other equipment; in addition, there are 1,800 head of draught animals.
    ▲ In order to prepare for this year's agricultural production, Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, is developing and consolidating mutual aid teams. Currently, Xingping County has an average of 22 mutual aid teams in each township, and this spring it will be developed to an average of 30 to 40 mutual aid teams per township. The existing mutual aid teams should be improved in terms of strengthening leading cadres, combining sideline business operations, and combining technical improvements.
    ▲ In the first batch of areas in Henan Province to complete land reform, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid teams has accounted for 20 to 50 percent of the total number of peasant households. However, some areas also have deviations such as being eager for quick results, pursuing numbers, and large-scale grouping. In order to correct these deviations and prevent mutual aid teams from collapsing during the slack farming season, the leading organs of Henan Province have paid attention to consolidating the existing mutual aid teams in the increase production and practice economy movement, combining winter production and winter study work, in order to lay a solid foundation for the patriotic production increase movement.

    ▲据山西省合作社联合社统计，目前全省各地合作社已把价值一百五十二亿元以上的新式农具、肥料和农药等生产资料分配给社员；各地合作社准备在春耕前运往农村的各种生产资料有：步犁、铡草机等新式农具一万件，水车一万三千三百六十多部，肥田粉、骨肥等肥料三万三千五百多吨，农药二百七十四吨和喷雾器等六万多件；另外，还有耕畜一千八百头。
    ▲为了给今年的农业生产作准备，陕西省兴平县正在发展和整顿互助组。现在，兴平全县每乡平均有二十二个互助组，今年春天要发展到每乡平均三十到四十个互助组。现有的互助组要在加强领导骨干、结合经营副业和结合改进技术等方面提高一步。
    ▲河南省第一批完成土地改革的地区，参加互助组的农户，已占农户总数的百分之二十到五十。但是，部分地区也有急于求成、追求数字和大编组等偏差。河南省领导机关为纠正这些偏差，避免互助组在农闲时期垮台，已注意在增产节约运动中，结合冬季生产和冬学工作整顿和巩固现有的互助组，为爱国丰产运动打下坚实的基础。
