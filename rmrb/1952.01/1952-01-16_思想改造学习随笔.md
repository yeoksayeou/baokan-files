Removing anxieties and promoting democracy are important conditions for carrying out the study movement.

In some places, the ideological remolding study movement cannot be carried out effectively. One important reason is that the masses are not sufficiently conscious, and therefore their attitude towards learning is not correct enough.

Why can't the attitude towards learning be straightened out? This is because the significance of learning is not understood correctly. If the understanding is incorrect or insufficient, there will be many ideological anxieties. These anxieties hinder learning, making learning a passive response. If this is the case for the majority, the discussion will not be able to be conducted well; if this is the case for the minority, the discussion will become "hemiplegic."

Mutual criticism can certainly inspire self-awareness, but it is not enough; it is also necessary to promote democracy, so that everyone can speak their inner thoughts, and everyone's actual thoughts can face each other without being obscured by heavy clouds, so that learning can be carried out smoothly. Those who lead the study must pay attention to finding typical and individual ideological anxieties and try to dispel them in order to promote learning.

There are all kinds of anxieties.

"Everyone knows that I am progressive. If it is revealed that I have backward thoughts, wouldn't my reputation be ruined?"

"Now we must draw a clear line between the enemy and us. If I say something wrong and expose enemy thinking, I will become the target of public criticism. That would be terrible!"

"When I hear the words of these backward elements, I should criticize them; but my theoretical level is not high, and if I criticize wrongly, it will be counterproductive; causing resentment would be even worse."

The above are just a few examples, and in reality, they are ever-changing. However, no matter how they change, they do not deviate from the core: those who consider themselves progressive are afraid of appearing backward, those who consider themselves backward are afraid of being attacked, and those who consider their thoughts or history problematic are afraid of being exposed.

All anxieties stem from not understanding that learning is self-education, self-transformation; not understanding that thought is like sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you retreat; not understanding that to constantly remove the old and bring forth the new, the most important thing is to combine with the masses; not understanding that "no destruction, no construction" requires criticism and self-criticism, and "no construction, no destruction" requires mastering ideological weapons.

All meetings that are cold, "hemiplegic," or have heated speeches but little gain and devolve into empty talk should examine ideological anxieties and eliminate the obstacles first.

Knowing Everything and Knowing Nothing

Old-fashioned non-working-class intellectuals have one characteristic: either they are arrogant or they are self-deprecating; or they are both arrogant and self-deprecating; in short, they cannot put themselves in the correct position to see their true colors.

Once they have a little knowledge, they consider themselves omniscient. "It is a shame for a Confucian scholar not to know something." "As such a famous scholar, how could I not be able to distinguish right from wrong? I have my own way." "When poor, cultivate your own moral character; when successful, benefit the world." "Walk alone and cultivate my noble spirit."

However, the world has changed, China has changed, new things are coming one after another, and wrong ideas are constantly hitting walls. The old ways no longer work, so they appear in the guise of knowing nothing. "Petty-bourgeois weaknesses, the vacillation of intellectuals, arrogance, individual heroism, I have them all. From now on, I will be humble and lowly, yielding everywhere. I will not say a word in meetings, be ambiguous in everything, follow the wind, and say yes to everything. Wouldn't this be almost blameless and prevent me from making mistakes?"

Whether it is arrogance or self-deprecation, the problem lies in the word "self," which is the "ego-centered" and "self-righteous" thought at play. Intellectuals mainly focus on studying and working, so they are good at speculation, short on practice, value the individual, fear the collective, and think they can objectively see the world, but they cannot objectively see themselves, so they don't know their own perspective on the world.

Knowing everything and knowing nothing are both layers of skin of the "porcupine gentleman" to resist external aggression. But what is protected under this layer of skin? It is not one's own thoughts brought from the womb, but only the collection of various foreign ideological influences produced in the class struggles of China, foreign countries, ancient times, and modern times. Then, why protect them and be buried with these outdated and contradictory foreign ideas? It is better to boldly expose them, lay them out, examine them yourself, let everyone examine them, discard the bad, pick up the good, and stride forward with the masses.

Seeing through oneself allows one to "know when you know, and know when you don't know," be realistic, and demand progress. This is a preliminary understanding of the materialistic and developmental viewpoint, and this is the first time to try using the weapon of historical materialism on oneself. This is the significance of self-examination. Stepping back is for the sake of jumping forward, and only by jumping away from the original position can one see clearly what was going on originally. This can never be replaced by simply scolding oneself, nor can it be fully achieved in a state of arrogance and self-deprecation.

    思想改造学习随笔
    金克木
    解除顾虑，发扬民主，是开展学习运动的重要条件
    有些地方思想改造的学习运动不能很好开展，其中有一个重要原因是群众的自觉性不够，因而学习态度不够端正。
    为什么学习态度不能端正起来？这是由于对学习的意义认识不正确。认识不正确，或不充分，就有许多思想上的顾虑。这些顾虑就障碍了学习，使学习成为被动的应付。如果多数是这样，讨论会就不能开得好；如果少数是这样，讨论会就成为“半身不遂”。
    互相批评固然可以启发自觉，但还不够；还必须发扬民主，使人人自己说出内心的话，大家的思想实际互相照面，而不被重重云雾蒙蔽，学习才能顺利开展。领导学习的人必须注意找出典型的和个别的思想上的顾虑，设法解除，才能推动学习。
    有各种各样的顾虑。
    “人人都知道我是进步的，倘若显出了我有落后思想，岂不声名扫地？”
    “现在要划清敌我界限，一句话说错，暴露了敌人思想，就要成为众矢之的，那还了得！”
    “听到这些落后分子的话，本来应该批评；但是理论不高，万一批评错了，反为不美；引起反感，更是弄巧成拙。”
    以上不过随手拈来略见一斑，实际上是千变万化的。不过，万变不离其宗，不外是：自命进步的怕显出落后，自认落后的怕受打击，自认思想或历史有问题的害怕暴露。
    所有顾虑都是不了解学习是自我教育，自我改造；不了解思想也如逆水行舟，不进则退；不了解要思想不断除旧布新，最要紧的是结合群众；不了解“不破不立”所以要批评和自我批评，“不立不破”所以要掌握思想武器。
    凡是开会冷场的，“半身不遂”的，发言热烈而收获微小流于空谈的，都应该检查一下思想上的顾虑，把障碍首先消除。
    无所不知和一无所知
    旧型的非工人阶级的知识分子有一个特点：不是自大，就是自卑；或者又自大，又自卑；总之，不能把自己放在正确的地位上来看自己的本来面目。
    有一点知识了，于是就以无所不知自居了。“一事不知，儒者之耻。”“我这样鼎鼎大名的学者，岂有不能明辨是非之理？我自有我的一套。”“穷则独善其身，达则兼善天下。”“独往独来，养吾浩然之气。”
    然而，世界变了，中国变了，新鲜事物纷至沓来，错误思想到处碰壁。老一套不行了，于是以一无所知的姿态出现。“小资产阶级劣根性，知识分子动摇性，自高自大，个人英雄主义，我都有。我从此自卑自贱，处处让人。开会一言不发，遇事模棱两可，随风转舵，唯唯否否。这样庶几乎可告无罪，不至于犯错误了罢？”
    自大也好，自卑也好，毛病就在一个“自”字，就是“自我中心”，“自以为是”的思想作怪。知识分子主要是以书斋劳动作生活重心的；因此长于推想，短于实践，重视个人，害怕集体，自以为能客观地看世界，而恰恰不能客观地看自己，因此也不知道自己看世界的角度。
    无所不知和一无所知都是“箭猪绅士”的抵抗外来侵犯的一层皮。然而在这层皮之下保护的是什么呢？并不是从娘胎里带来的自己的思想，而只是中国的、外国的、古代的、现代的，各种阶级斗争中所产生的，一些外来思想影响的集合体而已。那么，何必保护它们，为过了时的，与现实矛盾的，这些外来思想殉葬呢？还是大胆揭露，摊开来，自己查查，大家查查，丢掉坏的，拿起好的，大踏步随人民大众前进为妙。
    看穿了自己，就可以“知之为知之，不知为不知”，实事求是，要求前进了。这样就初步有了唯物的发展的观点，这样就在自己身上先试用一下历史唯物论的武器。这就是自我检讨的意义。向后一蹬为的是向前一跳，也只有跳开了原来的位置才能看得清原来是怎么一回事。这决不是简单地把自己骂一通所能代替的，也决不是在自大和自卑的心理状态下所能完全做到的。
