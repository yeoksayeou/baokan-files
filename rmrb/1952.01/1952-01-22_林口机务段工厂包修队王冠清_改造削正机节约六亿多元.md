    Wang Guanqing of the Lin Kou Locomotive Depot Factory Repair Team
    Reconstructed a Truing Machine, Saving Over 600 Million Yuan
    Editor: After hearing the call for increased production and frugality, Wang Guanqing (a Communist Party member), a foreman at the Lin Kou Locomotive Depot Factory Repair Team, thought: The Northeast railway system's increased production and frugality campaign will result in ten thousand more cars being loaded, which will inevitably require more locomotives. As a repairman, I must improve the quality of locomotives. Wang Guanqing couldn't sleep at night, constantly turning over this issue in his mind. The next day, he heard the chairman of the trade union say: "Our factory has a difficulty that needs everyone's help to solve, which is that the 'crank pins' of twelve locomotives have experienced 'uneven wear.' 'Uneven wear' requires going to a major facility for 'truing,' which has greatly impacted our financial plan and affected the locomotives leaving the depot." After hearing this, he thought: The locomotives can't leave the depot, and I also have a responsibility. Moreover, the loss is significant. At noon that day, while everyone else was eating, he was still looking for a solution, and finally found a "broken axle journal truing machine" in the scrap pile that hadn't been touched for a whole year. He immediately carried the "broken axle journal truing machine" to the parts room and converted it into a crank pin truing machine. This created a wealth of over 650 million yuan for the country.

    林口机务段工厂包修队王冠清
    改造削正机节约六亿多元
    编辑同志：林口机务段工厂包修队工长王冠清（共产党员）在知道增产节约的号召后，便想：东北铁路系统在增产节约运动中多装十万车，非得多使用机车不可。我是修车的，一定要把机车质量提高。王冠清在晚上睡不着觉，老是翻来复去地想这个问题。第二天他听到工会主席说：“咱们工厂有一个困难需要大家来解决，就是十二台机车‘曲拐销’发生了‘偏磨’，一‘偏磨’就需要进大场‘削正’，使我们的财务计划受到很大损失，影响了机车出库。”他听了这话以后就想：机车不能出库，我也有责任，而且这个损失可大呢。当天中午，大家都在吃饭了，他还在找窍门，终于在废铁堆里找到了整年没人过问的“坏轴头削正机”。他马上把“坏轴头削正机”扛到配件室，把它改成曲拐削正机了。这样给国家创造了六亿五千多万元的财富。
