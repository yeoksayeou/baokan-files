    在吕宋岛各地出击
    【新华社十二日讯】马尼拉迟到消息：菲律宾人民解放军在去年底最后一周中，曾在吕宋岛各地广泛出击。
    菲律宾人民解放军在去年十二月二十五日晚上，袭击吕宋岛北部嘉牙因省的拉罗市，从跳舞场中俘掳了该市市长安德尔斯和警察局局长，并缴获许多物资。
    十二月二十七日，菲律宾人民解放军攻击奎松省的巴德布尔格斯城。同日，他们又袭击季里诺傀儡政府所在地马尼拉以北三十哩的坎达巴，击毙伪警多名。
    据季里诺傀儡政府陆军当局承认：十二月二十八日深夜，一支强大的菲律宾人民解放军曾攻击马尼拉以南二十哩的地方。
    菲律宾人民解放军这一连串的攻击，使季里诺傀儡政府十分恐慌。
