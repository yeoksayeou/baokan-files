Party Organizations Must Strengthen Leadership Over Reading Groups

In the past year, reading groups have developed significantly across the country. Reading groups have been widely established in some factories, villages, streets, and schools. For example, in the North Sichuan District, 30,715 reading groups had been established by last August, with 912,378 members; in the Northwest Region, the three provinces of Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Qinghai, as well as the city of Xi'an, had more than 50,000 reading groups, according to incomplete statistics, with Shaanxi Province establishing 20,721 groups by last July, with 325,821 members; last September, Nanjing established 2,403 groups in factories, streets, suburban villages, and among students of Nanjing University, with 46,571 members, among whom industrial workers accounted for 41% of the total number of industrial workers in the city. These figures show that reading groups have become mass organizations for the people to study current affairs and politics.

The large-scale establishment of reading groups has not only raised the political consciousness of the masses participating in the reading groups, stimulated their patriotic enthusiasm, and made most of them active members in various national construction projects, powerfully promoting important tasks such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, land reform, and patriotic production competitions, but many reading groups have also conducted current affairs and policy propaganda to the broad masses through group members and the organization of propaganda teams, and the holding of current affairs exhibitions. In fact, reading groups have become a powerful weapon for publicizing and organizing the masses.

However, the development of reading groups is currently uneven across the country. In many places, reading groups have not yet been universally established. In some places where reading groups have been established, due to a lack of strong leadership and core members, or due to poor reading methods, they have failed to arouse the interest of the masses, becoming nominal or even gradually collapsing. Today, as we mobilize the people of the whole country to continue strengthening the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, launching the movement for increased production and economy, and carrying out the ideological remolding movement, reading groups will play a significant role in educating the people, raising their political consciousness, and mobilizing them to actively participate in these movements. Therefore, party organizations at all levels must attach great importance to the work of reading groups, strengthen their leadership over them, ensure that the established reading groups play a practical role, and gradually and universally establish them in places where they have not been established or where there are very few reading groups.

The key to running reading groups well lies in providing them with constant leadership, continuously improving reading methods, and helping reading groups cultivate core members. Local experiences have proven that wherever attention is paid to the leadership of reading groups, the reading groups continue to develop and consolidate, becoming good political schools for the broad masses to conduct self-education; wherever leadership is not paid attention to, the reading groups cannot play a good role, and many become nominal, or even gradually collapse.

How to improve and strengthen the leadership of reading groups? The existing experiences in various places are:

First, strengthen the leadership and backbone role of party propagandists in reading groups, and make strengthening reading groups a regular task of propagandists. For example, the thirteen reading groups and four current affairs study groups organized by the propagandist of the Xiguan Third District of Xi'an have become increasingly consolidated because they have propagandists as the backbone and carry out constant leadership. These reading groups and current affairs study groups have been able to regularly study and publicize current affairs policies. Last year, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Party on July 1st and the Army Day on August 1st, they organized a propaganda team of 100 people, mainly composed of members of each group, to carry out propaganda to the masses. Many activists in propaganda work have emerged within these groups.

Second, convene forums and representative meetings of reading groups, and hold amateur reading group training classes to educate and train readers and reading group members. Before May 1st last year, most counties in Suiyuan Province had held short-term training courses for readers or combined training for readers in propagandist training courses and village cadre party member training courses; Nanjing and Qinghai Province recently convened representative meetings of reading groups from all walks of life; last year, the cultural centers of the six districts of Nanjing held amateur training courses for resident report groups, training 1,385 reading group leaders, readers, and active group members. These forums and training classes have improved the readers' understanding of the People's Daily and exchanged reading experiences, which have greatly contributed to the improvement and consolidation of reading groups.

Third, when several reading groups have been established within a factory, a village, a street, or a school, core members from each group should be absorbed to form a central reading group or reading committee to unify the leadership of reading work. The task of this central reading group or reading committee is to understand the reading situation of each group, exchange reading experiences, guide the reading content and activities of reading group members in each period, and ensure the continuous improvement and development of reading groups. The central reading group or reading committee can be directly led by the trade union cultural and educational committee in factories, by the farmers' association or the cultural and educational committee of the township government in rural areas, by the cultural center in urban streets, with the assistance of the public security police station, and by the student union in schools. But no matter who leads it, the Party branch must pay attention to inspecting, studying, and promoting reading work.

Fourth, within the reading group, attention should be paid to combining cultural learning to improve the reading ability of group members and increase their interest in participating in the reading group. Generally, the masses participating in the reading group are active members of the masses, who not only demand to improve their political consciousness but also yearn to learn culture. The reading group should satisfy everyone's request. One way is to prepare blackboards and dictionaries in the group and have each member prepare a vocabulary book to learn new words at any time during reading. Another way is for the reading group to combine with running literacy classes or let the reading group members participate in literacy classes. The seventeen reading groups outside Shuixi Gate in Nanjing ran twenty literacy classes, with a total of more than 800 people, including those who did not participate in the reading groups, to study. Xiong Jingui, a fishmonger who could not even write his name in the past, was able to read the newspaper after participating in the reading group for six months. Moreover, the reading group can be gradually expanded in the literacy class.

Fifth, for reading groups to be universally established and maintained solidly, they must be combined with the production labor or social occupation of the reading group members. For example, when Nanjing Yongli Alkali Plant gradually achieved the participation of all employees in the reading group, it used the workers' production group as the reading group, which not only facilitated reading but also closely combined reading to promote production work. Under the leadership of the village branch, the reading group in Kaoshan Village, Haiyang County, Shandong Province, adopted a method of combining with farmers' production mutual aid groups in its development, reaching 60% of the masses in the whole village over the age of fifteen who could participate in the reading group and maintaining the ability to read the newspaper all year round.

Sixth, local newspapers should pay attention to strengthening their contact with reading groups and strengthening their business guidance. For example, many reading groups in Shanxi Province are also newspaper communication groups, and many excellent readers have become newspaper correspondents; Shaanxi Daily has tried to run a reading room for reading groups, lending popular pamphlets to reading groups for free, and widely soliciting reading groups to participate in discussions when organizing discussions on important issues in the newspaper. These have strengthened the role of reading groups.

### 党组织要加强对读报组的领导

    党组织要加强对读报组的领导
    近一年来，全国各地读报组已有很大发展。在部分工厂、农村、街道和学校中，读报组已普遍建立起来。如川北区去年八月已建立读报组三万零七百一十五组，组员九十一万二千三百七十八人；西北区的陕西、宁夏、青海三省及西安市的读报组，据不完全的统计，已有五万组以上，其中陕西省，在去年七月已建立二万零七百二十一组，组员三十二万五千八百二十一人；南京市去年九月在工厂、街道、郊区农村和南京大学学生中已建立二千四百零三组，组员四万六千五百七十一人，其中产业工人读报组员占全市产业工人人数百分之四十一。这些数字说明，读报组已成为带有广大群众性的人民学习时事政治的组织。
    读报组的大量建立，不仅提高了参加读报组群众的政治觉悟，启发了他们的爱国热情，使他们大多数成为国家各种建设中的积极分子，有力地推动了抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革、爱国生产竞赛等各项重要工作，而且许多读报组又通过组员和组织宣传小组、举办时事展览会等办法，对广大人民群众进行了时事政策宣传。实际上，读报组已成为宣传群众和组织群众的有力武器。
    但是，目前读报组在全国的发展尚不平衡。在许多地方读报组尚未普遍建立起来。有些地方已经建立起来的部分读报组，由于缺少强有力的领导和缺乏骨干分子，或由于读报方法不好，引不起群众兴趣，而成为有名无实，甚至逐渐垮台。在发动全国人民继续加强抗美援朝工作、开展增产节约运动和进行思想改造运动的今天，读报组在教育人民，提高人民政治觉悟，发动他们积极参加这些运动方面，将有重大的作用。因此，各地党的组织必须十分重视读报组的工作，加强对它的领导，使已建立的读报组切实发挥作用，没有建立和建立读报组很少的地方，应逐步地普遍建立起来。
    办好读报组的关键，在于予读报组以经常的领导，不断地改善与改进读报方法，并帮助读报组培养骨干分子。各地经验证明：凡是注意了对读报组的领导的地方，读报组就不断地获得发展和巩固，成为广大人民群众进行自我教育的良好政治学校；凡是不注意领导的地方，读报组便不能很好地发挥作用，有许多变为有名无实的东西，甚至逐渐垮台。
    怎样改进和加强对读报组的领导呢？各地已有的经验是：
    第一、加强党的宣传员在读报组中的领导和骨干作用，把加强读报组作为宣传员的一项经常工作。如西安市三区西关宣传员组织的十三个读报组和四个时事学习小组，就因为有宣传员充当骨干和进行经常领导，所以能日趋巩固。这些读报组和时事学习小组已能经常地进行时事政策的学习和宣传，在去年“七一”党的三十周年和“八一”建军节时，他们曾以各组组员为主组织了一百个人的宣传队，普遍向群众作了宣传。这些小组组内已经出现了不少宣传工作上的积极分子。
    第二、召开读报组的座谈会和代表会，举办业余读报组讲习班，教育和培养读报员、读报组员。绥远省多数县份在去年“五一”前都曾开办读报员短期训练班或者在宣传员训练班、村干党员训练班中结合训练了读报员；南京市和青海省在不久以前都召开了各界人民读报组代表会议；南京市去年六个区的文化馆举办了居民讲报组业余训练班，训练了读报组长、读报员、积极组员一千三百八十五人。这些座谈会和讲习班，都提高了读报员对人民报纸的认识，交流了读报经验，对提高与巩固读报组有很大作用。
    第三、凡一个工厂、一个村庄、一条街道、一个学校以内已建立有几个读报组的时候，应吸收各组中的骨干分子成立中心读报组或读报委员会，以统一领导读报工作。这个中心读报组或读报委员会的任务，是了解各组读报情况，交流读报经验，指导各时期读报内容和读报组员的活动，保证读报组的不断改善和发展。中心读报组或读报委员会，在工厂可由工会文教委员会直接领导，在农村可由农民协会或乡政府文教委员会直接领导，在城市街道由文化馆直接领导，公安派出所予以协助，在学校由学生会直接领导。但不论归谁领导，党的支部都必须注意检查、研究与推动读报工作。
    第四、在读报小组内，应注意结合文化学习，提高组员阅读能力，增加组员参加读报组的兴趣。一般参加读报组的群众都是群众中的积极分子，不仅要求提高政治觉悟，而且渴望学习文化。读报组应该满足大家这个要求。一种办法是组内自备黑板、字典，并让每个组员备有生字本，在读报中随时学习生字。另一种办法是读报组结合办识字班或让读报组员参加识字班。南京市水西门外十七个读报组办了二十个识字班，连没参加读报组的群众共八百余人进行学习，卖鱼小贩熊金贵，过去连自己姓名也不会写，参加读报组六个月后能读报了。并且，在识字班中可以逐渐扩大读报组。
    第五、读报组要想普遍建立和保持巩固，必须与读报组员的生产劳动或社会职业相结合。如南京市永利錏厂逐步地达到全部职工参加读报组时，便以工人生产小组为读报小组，这样既便利于读报，又能密切结合读报推动生产工作。山东省海阳县靠山村的读报组，在村支部领导之下，在发展中采取了与农民生产互助组相结合的方式，达到了全村十五岁以上能够参加读报组的群众百分之六十参加，并保持了能够常年读报。
    第六、各地报纸要注意加强和读报组联系，加强对他们的业务指导。如山西省许多读报组同时又是报纸的通讯组，许多优秀的读报员作了报纸的通讯员；陕西日报试办了读报组阅览室，免费借出通俗小册子给读报组阅读，并在报上组织讨论重要问题时，广泛征求读报组参加讨论。这些，都加强了读报组的作用。
