Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 24th: The full text of the speech by our side's representative, General Xie Fang, at the Third Agenda Subcommittee of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on January 24th is as follows:

	For four consecutive days, your side has been driven to the end of its arguments, unable to support your unreasonable demand, under the guise of restricting the restoration and construction of airfields, to interfere in our internal affairs. But yesterday, your side even reversed black and white, stubbornly claiming that our side had not refuted the various arguments you have put forward in the past to defend this demand. This is completely absurd and ridiculous. I am willing to spend some more time summarizing the hypocrisy and emptiness of your various arguments to expose the true intention of your insistence on this demand.

	First, I want to point out that our side firmly opposes your side's proposal and insistence on provisions restricting airfield equipment within Korea in the discussion of the specific arrangements for a ceasefire and armistice in Korea. The basic reason is that this restriction interferes with the internal affairs of an independent and sovereign country, and it is a condition that should not and cannot be discussed at a military armistice conference conducted on an equal footing by both sides. The secondary and subordinate reason for our firm opposition to it is that it is an unnecessary condition. Your side has distorted our position, stubbornly claiming that because our side has not explicitly stated whether we intend or do not intend to restore and construct airfields during the armistice, it proves that our side does indeed plan to develop air force strength on a large scale during the armistice. It seems that the reason why our side opposes your unreasonable demand is because it hinders some plan of ours to sabotage the military armistice. I have previously pointed out that your side's distorted and slanderous assumption is untenable. What our side is concerned about is the absolute non-interference in our internal affairs. As for the restoration and construction of airfields, it may or may not be carried out, that is another matter. The above is our side's basic position in the current dispute, which cannot be doubted or distorted in any way. The issue of restricting airfields, by its very nature, should not and cannot be discussed at a military armistice conference. However, because your side has put forward various excuses and insisted on discussion, our side is willing to patiently refute each of your arguments once again.

	What are your arguments? One of the earliest arguments your side put forward was that during the period of hostilities, your side was restricting our side's construction and restoration of airfields. Therefore, during the armistice, your side wants to continue to restrict our side's right to restore and construct airfields in the same way. From this argument, it can be seen that your side has to admit that your proposal is a unilateral demand from your side. In fact, even during the period of hostilities, did your side restrict our side's restoration and construction of airfields? No. Your side certainly hindered and sabotaged our side's restoration and construction to some extent, but at the same time, our military actions also caused huge losses to your side's air force strength. Moreover, according to the trend over a considerable period of time, the effect of your side's obstruction and sabotage is constantly diminishing. Your side also saw that the development of the situation existing during this prolonged war was unfavorable to your side's unilateral demands. Therefore, you soon put away this argument.

	Next, your side put forward the fallacy that if our side builds and constructs airfields, it will threaten the safety of your side's troops. From this argument, the unilateral arbitrariness of your proposal can also be seen. Everyone knows that it is precisely your side that has used your planes and airfields to carry out devastating and indiscriminate bombing in the Korean War. This bombing is not only aimed at our side's troops and military facilities, but is also intended to endanger the survival of the Korean nation. After the armistice, the threat of your side's air force to the safety of our troops and people still exists, and our side has also agreed to your side's demand for troop and equipment rotation. However, our side has not proposed restricting your side's airfield equipment and canceling rotations on the grounds of reducing this threat. We believe that our side's proposal that neither side introduce any combat aircraft from outside Korea during the armistice guarantees that the air force strength of both sides in Korea will not increase. Therefore, even the possible construction of airfields will not be enough to pose a threat to the other side.

	Your side's third argument is that restoring and constructing more airfields will increase air force capability, overturning the current balance of military capabilities between the two sides in Korea, and thereby undermining the stability of the military armistice. This statement includes several layers of erroneous views:

	First, our side has also repeatedly pointed out that there is a general balance of military strength between the two sides on the Korean battlefield. The reason why our side mentions this is to explain the basis of the armistice negotiations based on the current actual situation, and to remind your side that both sides must adopt an attitude of equal treatment based on fair and reasonable principles to negotiate an armistice agreement. Neither side should and cannot force the other side to accept unreasonable unilateral demands. Although the current situation on the battlefield is like this, our side is by no means advocating the "maintenance of the balance of military capabilities between the two sides." Your side's so-called "maintaining the balance of military capabilities between the two sides" is fundamentally unreasonable. Because this proposition is actually to maintain the war in Korea for a long time in order to create a tense situation in the world. Our side has consistently advocated convening a higher-level political conference immediately after the armistice is realized, and quickly withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea in order to completely eliminate the state of war and peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

	Second, your side's so-called "maintaining the balance of military capabilities between the two sides" is intolerable to any independent and sovereign country. Because everyone knows that in modern warfare, so-called military capabilities include many factors, involving all aspects of a country's internal affairs. Therefore, any attempt to "limit military capabilities to a certain level" will inevitably interfere in internal affairs, and interference in internal affairs is not allowed by any truly independent and sovereign country. Your side's restriction of the military capabilities of both sides within Korea can only show that the areas within Korea under your side's control have no sovereignty and independence to speak of. But your side has again forgotten that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is an independent and sovereign country.

	Third, since military capabilities in modern warfare include many complex and variable factors, theoretically speaking, unless the warring parties stop changing and developing in all aspects of their national life, the military capabilities of both sides cannot be fixed at a specific level. This means that the so-called "maintaining the balance of military capabilities between the two sides" is actually impossible, and it is clear that your side is not prepared to restrict the increase in military capabilities in the areas under your side's control in Korea during the armistice. Your side's senior officials have publicly stated that they want to support and strengthen South Korea's military strength after the armistice is realized. In fact, isn't your side already using methods such as establishing military academies to lay the foundation for the implementation of this policy? Why, in this regard, does your side not apply your so-called fallacy of "restricting the increase in military capabilities" and insist on restricting it? According to your logic, since your side has proposed restricting our side's air force capabilities during the armistice, then, in order to so-called "maintain the balance of military capabilities between the two sides," shouldn't our side also propose restricting the increase in your side's army capabilities during the armistice? However, our side has not made such a proposal, and our side will never make such a proposal, because our side has no fear of the increase in military equipment in the areas under your side's control in Korea. Moreover, our side believes that in order to ensure the stable and effective military armistice, both sides have agreed to determine the basic principle of not entering reinforcing military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea. After the armistice is realized, it is also determined to quickly convene a higher-level political conference to further peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Therefore, there is no need to establish such a restrictive regulation.

	Fourth, in order to ensure the stability of the military armistice, your side's so-called "restricting the military capabilities of both sides within Korea from increasing in order to maintain balance" is completely unnecessary. I have pointed out many times that the reason why the Korean War involves such a wide range and is so serious to the current extent is because it involves the military strength of many foreign countries. Therefore, since both sides have agreed to determine the basic principle that neither side will enter reinforcing military personnel and war equipment from outside Korea during the armistice, the foundation for maintaining the stability of the military armistice has been laid. Speaking of specific air force strength, anyone with common sense knows that combat aircraft are its decisive component. The size of air force strength is generally measured by the number of combat aircraft. It is precisely because of this fact that your side used to assert that our side intends to increase air force strength, based on the so-called slanderous guesses and ridiculous rumors that our side would violate the agreement and enter aircraft from outside Korea during the armistice, or that our side was transporting in and storing boxed aircraft, etc., as a decisive premise. Later, your side also realized that this kind of speculation and rumor was a mockery of the negotiations and yourselves, so you changed to another statement. You emphasized that your side did not want to create the impression that your side was implying that either side intended to violate the agreement. This time you said that even without adding aircraft, as long as the number of airfields increased, air force capabilities would increase two or even three times. Isn't this kind of sophistry also naive and ridiculous? Under the condition of not increasing aircraft, any possible restoration or construction of airfields or other subordinate factors in air force strength, possible changes, is by no means enough to undermine the stability of the armistice.

	Above, I have re-comprehensively refuted every argument of your side in support of the unreasonable demand of so-called "restricting the restoration and construction of airfields." None of your arguments stand. In recent days, even you have been unable to bear the ridicule of these arguments for yourselves. However, you still stubbornly insist on inserting an unreasonable, unnecessary, and especially unacceptable clause into the already complete principles and regulations for arranging and supervising the armistice. It is not difficult to understand the purpose of your side's unreasonable attitude. Your side, under the guise of "restricting the restoration and construction of airfields," attempts to interfere in our internal affairs through negotiations, through the form of an agreement. Your side has tried to cover this up in various ways in the past, but we are not so easily deceived. We also clearly remember General Tunner admitting on December 22nd of last year that restricting airfield equipment was indeed your side's interference in our internal affairs, although it was so-called one percent interference in our internal affairs. Since your side clearly knows that your proposal is interference in our internal affairs and is not related to ensuring the stability of the armistice, but still insists on it with sophistry, this cannot but make our side suspect what your true intentions are. This makes our side unable to help but deeply suspect that your true intentions are not only to interfere in our internal affairs, but also to maintain your side's position of wantonly carrying out indiscriminate bombing, so as to re-launch an offensive at a time of your side's choosing after the armistice. Your side, seeing that this aggressive purpose cannot be achieved under our side's strong opposition, still attempts to use various provocative behaviors and intimidation to help it. I frankly tell you that if debate cannot help your side achieve this illegitimate purpose, provocative behavior and intimidation will definitely not help your side either. For the resolution of the third agenda item and for ensuring the stable and effective armistice, our side's January 9th plan has provided a complete set of principles and regulations. I suggest that your side accept our side's January 9th plan.

    在一月二十四日朝鲜谈判第三项议程小组委员会上
    解方将军发言驳斥美方荒唐论点
    【新华社开城二十四日电】朝鲜停战谈判的我方代表解方将军在一月二十四日第三项议程小组委员会上的发言全文如下：
    一连四天以来，你方已经理屈词穷，无法支持你方假借限制机场的修复与兴筑为名，进行干涉我方内政的横蛮无理的要求。但昨天你方竟颠倒黑白，硬说我方未曾驳倒你方过去所提出辩护这一要求的各种论点，这是完全荒唐无稽的。我愿意多花一些时间将你方各种论点的虚伪和空洞综述一遍，以揭露你方坚持这一要求的真正意图。
    首先我要指出：我方坚决反对你方在朝鲜停火与停战的具体安排问题的讨论中，提出与坚持限制朝鲜境内机场设备的规定，基本理由是因为这种限制干涉到一个独立主权国家的内政，它是一个双方在对等基础上进行的军事停战会议所不应该和不容许提出讨论的条件。我方对它坚决反对的其次的和附属的理由是因为它是一个不必要的条件。你方歪曲了我方的立场，硬说因我方未明确声明究竟我方有意或无意于停战期间修复与兴筑机场，就证明我方确乎计划在停战期间大量发展空军力量，似乎我方反对你方这一无理要求的理由，就是因为它妨碍了我方某种预谋破坏军事停战的计划。我前已指出你方这种曲解与污蔑性的假设是不能成立的。我方所关心的是我方内政的绝对不受干涉，至于机场的修复与兴筑则可能进行亦可能不进行，那是另外一个问题。以上是我方在目前争论中的基本立场，不容有任何怀疑或歪曲的。限制机场的问题就其本身的性质而言，是不应该和不容许在军事停战会议中提出讨论的，但由于你方提出种种藉口，坚持讨论，我方愿意再一次耐心地驳斥了你方的每一论点。
    你方的论点是什么呢？你方最早提出的一个论点是敌对行为进行期间，你方是在限制我方机场的兴筑与修复，因此停战期间，你方要照样继续限制我方修复与兴筑机场的权利。从这一论点可以看出，你方也不得不承认你方这一提议乃是你方片面的要挟。实际上即在敌对行动进行期间，你方是否限制了我方机场的修复与兴筑呢？没有。你方固然在某种程度上阻挠和破坏了我方这种修复与兴筑，但同时我方的军事行动也造成着你方空军力量的巨大损失，而且按照相当时间以来的趋势，你方这种阻挠和破坏的效果是不断缩小了。你方自己也看到这种延长战争期间所存在的情势的发展是不利于你方的片面要求的，因此，不久你们就收起了这一论点。
    接着你方提出了所谓如果我方修建与兴筑机场，就会威胁你方部队安全的谬论。从这一论点里，同样可以看出你方提案的片面武断性。谁都知道正是你方利用你们的飞机和机场在朝鲜战争中施行毁灭性的狂轰滥炸，这种轰炸不仅是以我方的部队与军事设施为目标，而且是意在危害朝鲜民族的生存的。停战之后，你方空军对于我方部队和人民的安全的威胁还是存在的，而且我方还同意了你方关于军队和装备的轮换的要求，但我方却没有以削减这种威胁为理由，而提出限制你方机场设备和取消轮换的建议。我们认为我方提出了停战期间双方不从朝鲜境外进入任何作战飞机的建议，就是保证了双方在朝鲜境内的空军力量不会有所增加。因此，即令可能进行的机场的修建，也绝不足以造成对对方的威胁。
    你方的第三个论点是修复与兴筑了更多的机场就会增加空军能力，推翻目前在朝鲜存在的双方军事能力的平衡，并因而破坏军事停战的稳定。这种说法里面包括好几层错误观点：
    第一，我方也曾经一再指出，目前在朝鲜战场存在着双方军力的大体平衡。我方之所以这样提，是为了根据目前的实际状况，说明停战谈判的基础何在，并为了提醒你方，双方必须根据公平合理的原则，采取平等对待的态度，来协商停战协议，谁也不应该而且不可能强迫对方接受无理的片面要求。战场上的现状虽然如此，但我方决不是主张什么“保持双方军事能力的平衡”。你方所谓“保持双方军事能力平衡”的主张是根本不合理的。因为这一主张实际上就是在朝鲜长期维持战争，以便在全世界制造紧张局面。我方则一贯主张在停战实现后迅即召开高一级的政治会议，并将一切外国军队迅速撤出朝鲜，以便彻底消除战争状态，和平解决朝鲜问题。
    第二，你方所谓“保持双方军事能力平衡”的主张，是任何独立主权国家所不能容忍的，因为谁都知道在现代战争中，所谓军事能力包括许多因素，牵涉国家内政的各方面。因此任何所谓“限制军事能力于一定水平”的企图，就不可避免地要干涉内政，而干涉内政是任何真正独立的主权国家所不能容许的。你方之限制朝鲜境内双方的军事能力，只能说明朝鲜境内在你方控制之下的地区，是没有主权独立之可言的。而你方竟又忘记了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国乃是一个独立主权国家。
    第三，由于现代战争中的军事能力包括许多复杂的可变因素，就理论说，除非交战双方，在它的国民生活的一切方面停止变化与发展，双方的军事能力是不可能固定于一个特定水平的。这就是说所谓“保持双方军事能力的平衡”，是实际上办不到的事，而且显然你方也并不准备在停战期间限制朝鲜境内你方控制地区中的军事能力的增加。你方的高级官员曾经公开声称，要在停战实现之后扶植并加强南朝鲜的军事力量，实际上你方不是也已经用什么成立军事学院等等方法，在为这一政策的执行建立基础吗？为什么在这一方面你方却又不应用你方的所谓“限制军事能力增加”的谬论，而主张加以限制呢？按照你方的逻辑，既然你方提出在停战期间限制我方的空军能力，那么，为了所谓“保持双方军事能力的平衡”，我方不是同样应该提出在停战期间限制你方陆军能力的增加吗？然而我方并没有这样提，我方也决不会这样提，因为我方对于在朝鲜境内你方控制地区的军事设备的增加并无所恐惧。而且我方认为为了保证军事停战的稳定有效，双方已经同意确定不从朝鲜境外进入增援的军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药的基本原则，在停战实现之后，又确定迅速召开高一级的政治会议，进一步和平解决朝鲜问题，因此，也就无需乎订立这样一种限制的规定。
    第四，为了保证军事停战的稳定，你方所谓“限制朝鲜境内双方军事能力不得增加，以便保持平衡”的主张，也是完全不必要的。我已经多次指出朝鲜战争之所以牵涉这样广，并且严重到目前程度，是因为它牵涉了许多外国的军力。因此，既然双方同意确定了停战期间双方不从朝鲜境外进入增援的军事人员和战争装备的基本原则，就已奠定了保持军事停战稳定的基础。说到具体的空军力量，任何有常识的人都知道作战飞机乃是它的决定性的构成因素。空军力量的大小一般都是以作战飞机的多寡作衡量的单位的，正是由于这一事实，你方过去断言我方有意增加空军力量时，是以所谓我方要在停战期间违反协议，从朝鲜境外进入飞机，或者以所谓我方正在运入并贮起装箱的飞机等等污蔑性猜测和可笑的谣言作为决定的前提的。后来你方自己也认识到这种猜测和谣言是对于谈判和你们自己的嘲笑，于是换了另一种说法。你们强调说，你方不愿造成一种印象，认为你方是在暗示任何一方意图违反协议。你们这一次说，即使不增添飞机只要增加了机场，空军能力也会增加两倍，乃至三倍。这种诡辩难道不也是幼稚可笑的吗？在不增加飞机的条件下，任何可能的机场的修复或兴筑或其他空军力量中的附属因素，可能发生的变化，是决不足以破坏停战的稳定。
    以上我重新综合地驳斥了你方支持所谓“限制机场修复与兴筑”的无理要求的每一个论点。你们的论点是没有一个站得住脚的。最近几天来，连你们也受不住这些论点对你们自己的嘲笑了，然而你们竟依然厚颜坚持要在已经完备了的安排与监督停战的原则规定中，插入一条不合理不必要尤其是不能容许的条款。你方这种蛮横无理的态度其目的究竟何在，不难了解。你方是假借“限制机场修复与兴筑”之名，企图通过谈判，通过协议的形式来干涉我方内政。这一点你方曾想用种种方法掩饰过去，但我们却不是这样容易欺骗的。我们也清晰地记得滕纳将军在去年十二月二十二日承认过，限制机场设备确是你方对我方内政的干涉，虽然是所谓对我方内政的百分之一的干涉。你方既然明明知道你方的提案是干涉我方内政，而且是与保证停战稳定无关的，但却仍然强词夺理地加以坚持，这就不能不使我方怀疑你方的真实意图究竟何在。这就使我方不能不深深地怀疑你方的真实意图，不但是干涉我方内政，并且是要保持你方恣意施行狂轰滥炸的地位，以便在停战后在你方所选择的时间重新发动进攻。你方眼看到这一侵略性的目的，在我方坚强反对下达不到了，还企图用各种挑衅行为与恫吓来助一助威。我坦白地告诉你们，如果辩论不能帮助你方达到这种非分的目的，挑衅行为与恫吓，也决计帮助不了你方的。对于第三项议程的解决和对于保证停战的稳定有效，我方一月九日方案已提供了一套完整的原则规定，我建议你方接受我方一月九日的方案。
