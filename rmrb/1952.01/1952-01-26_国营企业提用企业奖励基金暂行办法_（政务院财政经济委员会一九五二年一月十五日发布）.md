    Provisional Measures for State-Owned Enterprises to Withdraw Enterprise Bonus Funds
    (Promulgated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on January 15, 1952)

Article 1: These measures are formulated to implement the economic accounting system, stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of enterprises in production and operation management, and gradually improve the working and living conditions of employees on the basis of further improving production.

Article 2: All state-owned grassroots enterprises that have determined capital, stipulated reasonable production quotas and consumption quotas, and implemented the economic accounting system may apply for the retention of enterprise bonus funds after completing the state-approved plans (production, sales, financial plans, etc.) in accordance with the provisions of these measures.

The term "state-owned grassroots enterprises" refers to grassroots enterprises of factories, mines, railways, shipping, automobile transportation, and postal and telecommunications enterprises. State banks, state-owned trade, and agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy enterprises are not included in this category and are not subject to these measures; however, factory enterprises led by non-industrial departments may be subject to these measures.

Article 3: The sources of enterprise bonus funds are:
    1. Extracted from the state-approved planned profits.
    2. Extracted from above-plan profits.

For enterprises with planned losses approved by the state, the reduced amount of losses shall be regarded as above-plan profits.

Article 4: If the actual cost of a product is higher or lower than the planned cost due to the following reasons, the cost and profit shall be adjusted and calculated:
    1. Due to the increase or decrease in the price of raw materials, semi-finished products, fuel, and other auxiliary materials.
    2. Cost reduction due to the replacement of major raw materials, fuel, etc.
    3. Due to the increase or decrease in wage standards, tax rates, interest rates, depreciation rates, labor insurance rates, and freight rates.
    4. Due to the adjustment of product transfer prices or commodity wholesale prices higher or lower than the original prices.

Article 5: Based on the different labor intensity and the degree of impact on the health of employees, as well as the possibility of increasing production quotas and reducing consumption quotas, different enterprises shall retain enterprise bonus funds according to the following provisions:
    Category 1: Mining industry, coal mining industry, ferrous metal smelting industry, non-ferrous metal smelting industry, petroleum industry, acids, alkalis, chemical fertilizers, mineral chemical industry, cement, mica, asbestos industry, etc., shall extract 20% from above-plan profits and 5% from planned profits.

    Category 2: Electric power industry, machine manufacturing industry, agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, telecommunications equipment manufacturing industry, building materials manufacturing industry, railways, shipping, automobile transportation, postal and telecommunications, textile industry, light chemical industry, industrial rubber manufacturing industry, paper industry, printing industry, leather industry, etc., shall extract 15% from above-plan profits and 3.5% from planned profits.

    Category 3: Food industry and other light industries not belonging to Category 1 and 2, public utilities, etc., shall extract 12% from above-plan profits and 2.5% from planned profits.

The total amount of enterprise bonus funds retained by each enterprise throughout the year shall not exceed 15% of the total annual basic wage.

Article 6: State-owned grassroots enterprises that comply with the provisions of Articles 2, 3, and 4 of these measures may, after the annual final accounts are approved, prepare a calculation sheet for the retained enterprise bonus funds in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of these measures, and submit it to the higher-level competent authority, which shall transfer it to the financial authority at the same level for agreement, and then the enterprise's higher-level competent authority shall approve the retention. If the opinions of the competent authority and the financial department are inconsistent, they shall jointly submit it to the financial and economic committee at the same level for decision. State-owned grassroots enterprises may, after each quarterly settlement, apply for advance retention of a portion of the enterprise bonus funds for that quarter in accordance with the above provisions. The amount withdrawn shall not exceed two-thirds of the quarterly retention amount. After the annual final settlement, the settlement shall be made according to the approved amount for the whole year. If the withdrawal is less, the difference shall be made up; if the withdrawal is more, the excess shall be returned. Enterprises without detailed quarterly plans shall not retain this fund on a quarterly basis, but shall apply for retention in one lump sum after the annual final accounts are approved.

After each quarterly settlement, if the aforementioned state-owned grassroots enterprises have above-plan profits, the portion of the above-plan profits other than the portion retained by the grassroots enterprise shall be extracted by the higher-level administrative bureau (or company, general factory, etc.) of each grassroots enterprise and used temporarily for enterprise turnover; the final settlement shall be made at the end of the year.

Article 7: The scope of use of enterprise bonus funds is stipulated as follows:
    1. Payment of individual bonuses to advanced workers and labor models, collective bonuses to model units, and other bonuses not included in the total wage bill.
    2. Providing temporary relief to employees with special difficulties; however, the total amount of this relief expenditure shall not exceed 5% of the enterprise bonus funds that should be obtained during the same period.
    3. New construction, expansion, and improvement of various welfare facilities for improving the material and cultural life of employees and other collective welfare undertakings (such as employee dormitories, hospitals, sanatoriums, kindergartens, nurseries, canteens, and sports equipment).
    4. Factory safety and health equipment that cannot be implemented administratively for the time being.
    5. Other necessary expenses required to improve production and supplement existing production equipment.

Article 8: The general person in charge of the state-owned grassroots enterprise (factory director, mine director, etc.) shall, together with the trade union of the enterprise, prepare a budget for the use of enterprise bonus funds, submit it to the factory management committee for approval (or to the employee representative assembly if there is no factory management committee), report it to the higher-level competent authority for record, and report the income and expenditure to the factory management committee and the employee representative assembly on a regular basis. The trade union shall assist and supervise the use of enterprise bonus funds. If there are different opinions between the two parties that cannot be resolved through consultation, they may report to their respective higher-level authorities for consultation. If they still cannot be resolved, they may request arbitration from the labor administrative department.

Article 9: If the higher-level administrative bureau (or company, general factory, etc.) of a state-owned grassroots enterprise holds a collective welfare undertaking that is large-scale and beyond the capabilities of one factory, it may concentrate the use of part of the enterprise bonus funds of its subordinate units with the consent of the enterprise administration and trade union.

Article 10: The use of enterprise bonus funds shall be settled once at the end of the year and reported to the approving authority for record. Those belonging to capital construction shall be transferred to the state's fixed assets for depreciation.

Article 11: These measures shall apply to local public enterprises.

Article 12: The power to interpret and amend these measures belongs to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council.

Article 13: These measures shall come into force from the date of promulgation.
