Our great motherland
In many parts of Inner Mongolia, public trading organizations have been established, reducing the price scissors between livestock products and industrial and agricultural products, and strengthening the role of material exchange. This has increased the purchasing power of the people of Inner Mongolia by 254 percent in 1950 compared to 1949, and by 360 percent compared to 1948. This is a scene of herdsmen in Inner Mongolia purchasing daily necessities at the sales station set up by the Xilin Gol League Beizi Temple Trading Company at the Nadaam Conference.
