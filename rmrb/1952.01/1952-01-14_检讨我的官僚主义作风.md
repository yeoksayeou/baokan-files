    Self-Criticism of My Bureaucratic Work Style
    Dai Qihua, Former General Manager of Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company
    I have been with the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company for a year and a half. During this period, not only did I fail to manage the enterprise well as entrusted by the Party and the people, but I also made many serious mistakes, causing great losses to state property and creating a negative political impact. I feel very ashamed. With the help of my superiors and all the employees of the department, I have the following understanding of the mistakes I have made in the past:
    First, I repeatedly violated the government's policies, laws, and various systems stipulated by higher-level leading bodies. In terms of construction, I carried out construction without the approval of relevant departments and was fined. For example, the construction of Renfeng Elementary School was fined 2 million yuan, the construction of the Bethune Medical College project was fined more than 12 million yuan, and the construction of the Xuzhou warehouse project was fined 120 million yuan. In terms of ensuring the safety of workers' lives during construction, there were continuous casualties in two projects undertaken, with a total of thirteen workers killed and fifty-seven injured. I did not take any measures for such serious incidents because I mistakenly believed that a few casualties were inevitable in such a large project. But when accidents happened several times in a row, I panicked. This shows that I still lack a correct understanding of the serious political and economic significance of protecting workers' safety during construction, and I have not regarded safety work as a regular and important part of our enterprise management and given it full attention. In terms of purchasing materials, in 1950, I found private merchants in Nanjing to rush to buy 916 bags of cement, exceeding the market price by two to two and a half times, disrupting the market, undermining the state's price policy, and creating a bad social impact. I also entrusted 600 million yuan to a private merchant, Dong Bochuan (who was also the deputy director of the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company's construction office), to purchase wood in the Northeast without signing any contract or providing any guarantees. The original delivery date was the end of September 1950, but to this day, neither the goods nor the money can be found. After investigation, it turned out that Dong Bochuan had deceived me. This caused a great loss to state property. Why was I deceived by him? The main reason is that I was surrounded by private merchants, accepted their bribes, and lost my political vigilance. Therefore, when handling affairs, I did not consider whether it would harm the people and the country, but instead acted based on personal feelings. In terms of cadre policy, the Xuzhou branch only considered the convenience of its own unit and arbitrarily poached technical personnel from the Northeast. Because I had the departmentalist idea in my mind that "the more technical personnel our company has, the better," I did not immediately stop them from doing so, and I did not seriously deal with it afterwards. At the same time, the phenomenon of using people improperly and blindly was also quite serious. For example, in 1950, people were sent to the Northeast to purchase wood, resulting in a loss of more than 1.2 billion yuan in state assets. What is particularly serious is that although many comrades repeatedly raised objections to this matter, I ignored them, which led to the expansion of the situation and the burial of cadres - the personnel who went to the Northeast have all been imprisoned in the court. In terms of management, in June 1950, the company held a business meeting at which I put forward the business policy of "ensuring profit from materials on the basis of breaking even on the project." This was a purely profit-seeking policy. In order to achieve the goal of making a fortune, I sent personnel to the Northeast to purchase timber. At that time, I calculated the accounts and found that buying timber from the Northeast could earn twice the amount; if we bought 10,000 to 20,000 cubic meters of timber, the company could close its doors and eat for several years. As a result, the procurement task was not completed (the purchased timber had a 50% reject rate), and the project also lost money.
    In terms of financial and economic systems, I showed serious supply system thinking. From the day I came to the company, I relaxed my control over the system. For example, 45,000 bags of cement were purchased in Tianjin without regard to the needs of the work; some of these cements were overstocked for half a year, and some for a year. The 250 tons of steel bars purchased from Shanghai were also overstocked for a long time. The Xuzhou branch overstocked more than 4 billion yuan worth of materials and did not carry out any cleanup in order to make a fortune from materials. Therefore, the state's financial tasks were not completed, causing difficulties for the bank in managing currency. In terms of office expenses, I did not control them even more. I myself did not act according to the system. For example, when it came to eating, I once told the general affairs department, "It doesn't matter if I eat 108,000 yuan more!" The same was true for official travel, spending as much as I reported, regardless of whether it complied with the system or not, and I had the final say. Over time, the lower levels followed suit, and no unit did not overspend. The system became a waste of paper and did not work, let alone control, supervise, and implement it.
    I was very arrogant and complacent, and even looked down on the policies and laws promulgated by the government, never looking at them. Especially after coming to this company, I felt that I had been a minister in the past, no smaller than a bureau chief, so I looked down on the leading cadres of the Industry Department; I felt that the instructions of the Industry Department were nothing great, and I did not pass those instructions on to the lower levels. But I used my "low level of education" and "eye problems" as excuses for looking down on leaders and not implementing instructions. Therefore, I showed a serious bad style of replacing the organization with the individual and replacing policies with feelings in my work. Some comrades repeatedly suggested that I not blindly engage in routine work and asked me to do a good job of leadership. I was very unhappy and felt that I had my own way, thinking, "What do you young kids know!" Some comrades suggested that I study policies and laws carefully and read more of the instructions and documents sent by higher authorities. But I always felt that policies were for talking about, not for implementing. Especially since I felt that I was running a construction factory, what policies and laws did I need! As long as I could make more money, that was fine. So I never considered any policy issues all day long, just messing around. I didn't sign patriotic pacts, let alone lead the masses and advance with the masses. After a long time, lower-level cadres all had opinions about me. I still didn't admit my mistakes and didn't care. Therefore, communication between the upper and lower levels was not smooth, and there was no unity between each other. The phenomenon of each leading cadre doing things in their own way existed for a long time. In this way, work gradually relaxed, and the company lost its leadership core. The masses were dissatisfied, but I did not conduct self-criticism and even attacked comrades who made suggestions to me. For example, when Comrade Wang Feng gave me suggestions at the branch meeting, I said at the group meeting, "Wang Feng is the branch secretary, he should fix himself first before fixing others!" In 1950, the newspaper criticized my bad work style. That was completely correct. But because I considered myself a meritorious person, was proud and complacent, and felt that I had lost face, I scolded the person who wrote the manuscript as "unorganized and undisciplined" and tracked down the person who wrote the manuscript everywhere. Some comrades said that I had a bureaucratic work style, and I couldn't understand it even more, and I publicly argued, "I don't have a bureaucratic work style at all!" Looking at it today, I not only have a bureaucratic work style, but I am also a complete bureaucrat. In the past, I thought I was great, did a lot of things, and had many achievements; after checking it today, I realized that I did not do a single satisfactory thing.
    In terms of material life, I was greedy for enjoyment. After I came to the company, the small kitchen overspent 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per month. In 1950, I made a set of single clothes that cost 400,000 yuan, 300,000 yuan more than other comrades. When the company built houses, it first built places for my wife and children to live. I raised flowers and fish. My dormitory needed five to eight packs of cigarettes every month. There was no standard for entertaining guests and giving gifts. No matter what kind of guests came, they were all invited to the Western Restaurant of the Dahua Hotel for dinner. The gifts given by others all became my private property. I squandered and enjoyed myself like this, but usually shouted to the comrades below: "Save! Save!" The comrades below all said: "Manager Dai always tells us to save, why doesn't he save himself?" In short, I wasted an average of more than 1 million yuan of people's property every month, which is 20 million yuan a year.
    What are the main sources of these problems?
    First of all, I have the conservative, narrow, selfish, and retaliatory thoughts of peasants. I never start from the overall situation in any problem; I like to be flattered; I like to report good news and don't like to report bad news in work; I have a simple task view; I rely on experience to eat, and it is not easy to accept new things; I do not listen to the opinions of the masses and do not talk about democracy on all issues; I just blindly do things without thinking much, and I do not admit mistakes when I am wrong. In particular, I used to adopt a perfunctory attitude towards inspection work and did not seriously seek improvement. These are the reasons for repeatedly making mistakes. For example, in the spring of 1950, when the Shandong Provincial People's Procuratorate came to inspect work, I felt that they were taking advantage of my loopholes, so I adopted a perfunctory attitude and said one thing but meant another. After they left, everything remained the same.
    After moving from the countryside to the city, my ideological consciousness changed, and I pursued enjoyment in life, forgetting that the country is currently in difficult conditions and the lives of the masses are still quite difficult. I was completely invaded and paralyzed by bourgeois ideology in politics. This is the root of my mistakes.
    I have no organizational concept. In the past, I regarded the general branch of the Party in the organization as my eyes and ears, as an appendage, and I was willing to scold and insult it. Therefore, it is difficult to talk about relying on the Party and using organizational forces to promote work. The reason why this company has not established a leadership core from 1950 to the present lies here.
    Through this review, I deeply realize that everyone's sincere help to me is to get me out of the quagmire. Otherwise, if I continue like this, I will go to my end and be abandoned by the people. In addition to making a deep self-criticism in order to correct my mistakes in future work, I also request the Party and superiors to give me the punishment I deserve.

    检讨我的官僚主义作风
    前山东省建筑工程公司总经理  戴启华
    我来山东省建筑工程公司已有一年半。在这一时期，我不但没有把党和人民交给我的企业管理好，相反地却犯了很多严重的错误，使国家资财蒙受很大损失，造成不良的政治影响，自己感到非常惭愧。这次在上级和本部门全体职工的帮助下，我对自己以往所犯的错误有如下的认识：
    首先是屡次违犯政府的政策法令和上级领导机关规定的各种制度。在施工方面，不经有关部门批准就施工而被罚款。例如修建仁丰小学，被罚款二百万元，修建白求恩医学院工程被罚款一千二百多万元，修建徐州仓库工程被罚款一亿二千万元。在施工中保障工人生命安全方面：承作某两项工程中曾连续发生伤亡事故，共死工人十三名，伤五十七名。对这样严重的事件我没有采取任何措施。因为我错误地认为：这样大的工程，伤亡几个人是不可避免的。但当事故连续发生几次时，自己又张惶失措。这说明了自己对在施工中保护工人安全的严重政治意义和经济意义还缺乏正确的认识，没有把安全工作看成是我们企业管理中经常的重要工作之一，并予以充分的重视。在购买材料方面：一九五○年我找私商在南京抢购水泥九百一十六袋，超过市价二倍到二倍半，扰乱了市场，破坏了国家的物价政策，造成恶劣的社会影响。我又曾把六亿元委托私商董伯川（又是山东省建筑工程公司营造处副处长）去东北代购木料，没有订任何合同，更没有任何铺保。原定一九五○年九月底交货，但直到如今，货、款都无踪影。经追查，原来是被董伯川欺骗了。这又使国家财产遭到很大损失。我为什么会受他的骗呢？主要是自己受了私商的包围，接受了他们的贿赂，失去了政治警觉性，因而办起事来，不考虑对人民、对国家有无损害，而是以私人感情用事。在干部政策方面：所属徐州分公司只顾本单位的方便，擅自拉拢东北技术人员。因为自己脑子里有着“本公司技术人员愈多愈好”的本位主义观念，所以没有立即制止他们这样做，在事后也没有认真处理。同时，用人不当、盲目使用人的现象也相当严重。如一九五○年曾派人去东北采购木料，损失了国家资财值十二亿多元。特别严重的是虽有不少同志对这事一再提出反对意见，自己却不睬不理，以致事态扩大，葬送了干部——去东北的人员都已被关进法院。在经营方面：一九五○年六月公司召开业务会议，我在这个会议上提出了“工程保本，材料赚钱”的经营方针。这是单纯发财的方针。为了达到发财的目的，我就派员去东北采购木材。当时我算了一下帐，去东北买木材回来可以赚二倍；如果买一万立方公尺到二万立方公尺木料，公司关起门来也能吃几年。结果是没有完成采购任务（买回的木料废品占百分之五十），工程也亏了本。
    在财政经济制度方面，自己表现了严重的供给制思想。从来公司那天开始，我就放松了对制度的掌握。如不根据工作的需要去天津采购水泥四万五千袋；这些水泥有的积压半年，有的积压一年。从上海买来的二百五十吨钢筋，也积压了很久。徐州分公司积压四十多亿元的材料，为了大发材料财，也不进行清理。因此，没有完成国家给予的财政任务，造成银行管理货币的困难。在机关开支方面，我更不加掌握。我自己也不按制度行事。譬如吃饭，我曾告诉总务部门：“我多吃十万八万没有什么！”因公外出也是如此，花多少报多少，不管它合不合乎制度，自己说了就算。久了，上行下效，没有一个单位不超支的，制度成了废纸，不起作用，更谈不到掌握监督执行了。
    我十分自高自大，甚至对政府所颁布的政策法令都瞧不起，从来也不看它一眼。尤其是来这个公司以后，觉得自己过去当过部长，比厅长也不小，因此对工业厅的领导干部看不起；觉得工业厅的指示没有什么了不起，也不向下级传达那些指示。但我又以我“文化水平低”、“眼睛有毛病”作为看不起领导、不执行指示的遁词。因此，在工作中表现了严重的以个人代替组织、以感情代替政策的恶劣作风。有些同志曾一再建议我不要盲目地搞事务工作，叫我好好地作领导工作。我很不高兴，觉得自己有一套，认为“你们这些毛孩子懂什么”！有的同志建议我好好学习政策法令，多看看上级发来的指示文件。但我总觉得政策是讲的，不是执行的。特别是我觉得自己是开营造厂的，还用得着什么政策法令！只要能多赚钱就行。所以我整天也不考虑什么政策问题，只是乱忙。爱国公约我也不订，更谈不到带领群众和群众一起前进。这样久了，下级干部都对我有意见。自己还不认错，满不在乎。因此，上下不通气，互相不团结，我们领导干部之间长期地存在着各自为政的现象。这样，工作日渐放松，公司失去领导核心。群众不满，我也不进行检讨，还打击对我提意见的同志。例如王峰同志在支部大会上给我提了意见，我就在小组会上说：“王峰是支部书记，他先把自己整好再整别人吧！”一九五○年，报纸曾对我的不良作风进行批评。那完全是正确的。但因为自己以功臣自居，骄傲自大，又觉得损了面子，就大骂写稿的人“无组织，无纪律”，并到处追查写稿的人。有的同志说我有官僚主义作风，我更是想不通，并公开辩驳说：“我才没有官僚主义呢！”今天看来，我不但有官僚主义作风，而且是一个十足的官僚主义者。过去我自以为了不起，作了不少事，有不少成绩；今天检查起来，才知道我并没有作出一件圆满的事。
    在物质生活方面，我贪图享受。我来公司后，小厨房每月超支七、八万元。一九五○年我作了一套单衣用了四十万元，比别的同志多三十万元。公司修房子，先修自己老婆、孩子住的地方。自己养花、养鱼。每个月自己的宿舍需要纸烟五条到八条。请客送礼没有标准。无论来了什么客都请到大华饭店西餐部吃饭。别人送的礼都变成了我的私有财产。自己这样挥霍享受，平时却向下边的同志喊：“节约呀！节约呀！”下边同志都说：“戴经理老叫我们节约，为什么他自己不节约？”总之，每个月我浪费掉的人民财产平均在一百多万元，一年得二千万元。
    这些毛病的主要根源是什么呢？
    首先，我有着农民的保守、狭隘、自私、报复的思想。什么问题我都不从整体出发；爱叫别人奉承；工作上好大喜功，爱听报喜，不爱听报忧；单纯任务观点；靠经验吃饭，不容易接受新事物；在
    一切问题上不倾听群众意见，不讲民主；任何事情只是盲干，不多思考，自己错了也不认错。尤其我过去对检查工作采取应付态度，不认真求改进。这些是屡次犯错误的原因。如一九五○年春天山东省人民检察署来检查工作，我觉得是他们钻我的空子，便采取了应付态度，口是心非。他们走后，一切仍然照旧。
    从农村到城市后，自己思想意识变了质，追求生活上的享受，而忘记了国家目前是处在困难的条件下，群众的生活还是相当艰苦的。自己在政治上完全受资产阶级思想的侵袭并麻痹起来。这是我犯错误的根源。
    我没有组织观念，过去我把机关党的总支部看成是我的耳目，是附属品，愿意骂就骂，愿意侮辱就侮辱。因此，就很难谈上依靠党和运用组织力量去推动工作。这个公司从一九五零年到现在仍然没有树立起领导核心，原因就在这里。
    通过这次检查，我深刻地认识到大家对我的诚恳帮助，是要使我从泥沼中爬出来。否则，再这样下去，将会使自己走向末路，被人民唾弃。我除作深刻的检讨，以求在今后的工作中改过以外，并请求党和上级给我以应得的处分。
