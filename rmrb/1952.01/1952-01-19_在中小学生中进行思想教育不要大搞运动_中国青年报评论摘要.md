    Don't Launch Mass Movements for Ideological Education Among Primary and Secondary School Students
    —— China Youth Daily Commentary Abstract
    The China Youth Daily published a commentary on the 15th stating: Don't launch mass movements for ideological education among primary and secondary school students.
    The commentary said: The purpose of strengthening ideological education among students is to raise the revolutionary consciousness of all students, equip them with a revolutionary worldview, and enable them to become both talented and virtuous cadres who will strive to develop the construction of the motherland in the future. The method of conducting ideological education is, first, to implement patriotism in coursework and extracurricular activities. This is what all primary, secondary, and higher education institutions should do. Second, we must fight against reactionary and erroneous ideas, and this must vary depending on the nature of the school. Generally speaking, primary and secondary school students are younger, and their thinking is still immature and has not yet taken shape; therefore, for general primary and secondary school students, we should regularly conduct specific and vivid patriotic education in and outside of class, based on their characteristics and level of acceptance. The crucial key to this kind of ideological education conducted in primary and secondary schools lies in the ideological remolding of teachers. If the ideology of primary and secondary school teachers is remolded, they can correctly conduct ideological education for students in and out of class, so that students' ideology can be remolded. Of course, it is possible to carry out regular, necessary, and appropriate criticism and self-criticism among primary and secondary school students, especially among secondary school students; however, it is not correct to turn ideological struggle into a school-wide student movement in primary and secondary schools, or a city-wide student movement in various primary and secondary schools in a city.
    The commentary said: It is necessary to carry out ideological struggle in universities. However, the leadership of the Communist Youth League committees and student unions in universities must pay attention to the fact that under the close leadership of the Party, they must strictly implement the principle of "solving ideological problems through ideological means," they must understand and study the ideological situation among students, and they must pay attention to closely contacting the masses and possessing a certain number of cadres, and proceed step by step and in a planned manner. Some universities in Beijing have the above conditions, so the students in these universities have achieved success in the struggle against reactionary ideas. If the necessary conditions are not met, then a full-scale ideological struggle should not be launched rashly and hastily among university students, but rather an educational method suitable for the specific circumstances of each school should be prescribed. In schools, the unfolding of ideological struggle must also prevent and oppose formalism.

    在中小学生中进行思想教育不要大搞运动
    ——中国青年报评论摘要
    中国青年报十五日发表评论：在中小学生中进行思想教育不要大搞运动。
    评论说：我们在学生中加强思想教育的目的，是提高全体学生的革命觉悟，使他们具有革命人生观，将来成为才德兼备的为发展祖国建设事业而奋斗的干部。进行思想教育的方法，首先是把爱国主义贯彻在功课以及课外活动里面。这一方面，大、中、小学校都是要这样做的。其次是向反动的错误的思想进行斗争，这一方面就必须随学校性质而有所不同。一般地说，中、小学的学生的年龄较幼，他们的思想还很幼稚并未成型；所以，对于一般中、小学生，应该根据他们的特点和接受程度，经常在课内课外进行具体生动的爱国主义教育。而在中、小学生中所进行的这种思想教育，其重要的关键在于教师的思想改造。中、小学校教师的思想得到改造，就完全可以正确地在课内课外对学生进行思想教育，使学生的思想得到改造。固然，在中、小学生中，特别在中学生中，能够进行经常性的必要的适当的批评与自我批评的；但是，把思想斗争在中、小学校里搞成全校性的学生的运动，或在一个城市里搞成全市性的各中、小学学生的运动，那是不正确的。
    评论说：在大学生里开展思想斗争是必要的。但是，大学里的青年团团委和学生会的领导方面必须注意在党的密切的领导之下，必须严格执行“思想问题，思想解决”的方针，必须了解与研究学生中的思想情况，并须注意密切联系群众与具备一定的干部力量，有步骤有计划地进行。北京一些大学具备以上的条件，所以这些大学的学生在和反动思想斗争中获得成功。假如必要的条件并没有具备，那么，在大学学生中也不应过于匆忙地贸然发动全校规模的思想斗争，而是应当另外规定适合于各该校具体情况的教育方式。在学校中展开思想斗争，同样要防止和反对形式主义。
