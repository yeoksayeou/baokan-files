When Tao Yong, a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning from Korea, gave a report at Peking University, he excitedly took out a beautiful medal. He said, "This was sent by Zheng Meilong, a student at Peking University, to the Volunteers on the Korean front, and it ended up in my hands." Before he could finish speaking, a female student—a member of the Youth League named Zheng Meilong—stood up in the lower left corner of the auditorium. She was short, had short hair, and was wearing a blue coat. Her face was flushed with a smile, and she waved excitedly to Tao Yong on the podium, who also waved back to her excitedly. At that moment, a burst of warm applause broke out in the auditorium, and everyone was moved by this heartwarming event.

This beautiful medal not only carried the thoughts of the people of the motherland for the front lines but also the deep affection of peace-loving people around the world. It was a medal from faraway Eastern Europe. It was awarded by the Czech government to an outstanding model worker in a famous Czech factory. And that model worker gave the medal to a Chinese youth friend who attended the World Youth Congress, who brought it back to the motherland and then gave it to Zheng Meilong. When all the people of China were dedicating their most beloved things to the most beloved people fighting on the Korean front—the Chinese People's Volunteers—Zheng Meilong also enthusiastically and happily sent this most beloved gift of hers to the Korean front. In August of last year, while the fifth campaign was fiercely underway on the Korean battlefield, this precious medal was sent to Tao Yong of a certain unit of the Volunteers. At that time, he was participating in a blocking action near Kimhwa. Receiving this gift from the faraway motherland, his heart was filled with infinite gratitude for the love of the people of the motherland, which further strengthened his fighting will and confidence in victory against the enemy. He immediately wrote a letter back to the motherland, thanking them for this precious battle friendship.

Today, Zheng Meilong, the giver of the gift, and Tao Yong, the recipient of her gift, met—a chance encounter. Thousands upon thousands of people in our motherland have dedicated their beloved gifts to support the most beloved people on the Korean front. Although they have not met, their hearts are connected. Our Volunteer comrades on the front lines have received gifts from the faraway motherland more than once, and these gifts have become a tremendous force inspiring the frontline fighters to fight even more bravely.

    一枚奖章
    当中国人民志愿军归国代表陶庸在北京大学报告的时候，他兴奋地拿出一枚精美的奖章。他说：“这是北京大学郑每龙同学，寄给朝鲜前线的志愿军的，它转到了我的手里。”他的话还没有说完，台下左前方的角落上，立即站起了一个个子不高，短短的头发，穿着蓝大衣的女同学——青年团员郑每龙。她的脸绯红地笑着，她兴奋地向主席台上的陶庸招着手，陶庸也兴奋地向她招着手。这时会场里立刻响起了一片热烈的掌声，所有的人们都为这热情的事情感动了。
    这枚精美的奖章不但带着祖国人民怀念前线的心意，它同时也带着爱好和平的世界人民的深情厚意。这是一枚来自遥远的东欧的奖章。是捷克政府奖励给捷克的一个著名工厂的一个出色的劳动模范的。而这位劳动模范又把这个奖章送给了一位参加世界青年代表大会的中国青年朋友，这位青年朋友把它带回祖国后，又转送给了郑每龙同学。当全中国的人民都把自己最心爱的东西献给战斗在朝鲜前线的最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军的时候，郑每龙也热情愉快地把这件自己最心爱的礼物寄到了朝鲜前线。就在去年八月里，当朝鲜战场上正激烈地进行着第五次战役的时候，这个珍贵的奖章寄到了某部志愿军陶庸手里。那时候，他正在金城附近参加阻击战。陶庸收到这个从遥远的祖国寄来的礼物，他的心里对于祖国人民的热爱充满了无限的感激，更加加强了他对敌人战斗的意志和胜利的信心。他立即写了一封信寄回了祖国，感谢这珍贵的战斗的友谊。
    今天送礼物的郑每龙和接受她礼物的陶庸见了面，这是一个偶然的会见。我们祖国千千万万的人民，都曾经为了支援在朝鲜前线的最可爱的人，献出了自己心爱的礼物，他们虽然没有见过面，但他们的心却是连在一起的。我们前线的志愿军同志们，他们曾经不止一次地收到过从遥远的祖国寄来的礼物，这些礼物都成为鼓舞前线战士们更加勇敢战斗的巨大的力量。　（生）
