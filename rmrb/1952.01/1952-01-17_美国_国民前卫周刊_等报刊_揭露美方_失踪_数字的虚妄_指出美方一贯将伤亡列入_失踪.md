Xinhua News Agency, dated 16th: During the Korean armistice negotiations, the US side, based on its own published so-called "missing" figures, denied the prisoner numbers proposed by the Korean and Chinese sides, seeking excuses to delay the negotiations. However, this argument is completely untenable. In fact, in order to conceal their heavy losses in the war of aggression against Korea, the US side has consistently listed many people killed in combat as "missing." This fact has been thoroughly exposed by American newspapers.
    The American "National Guardian Weekly," in its issue published on December 26, 1951, exposed the falsehood of the US government's published "missing" figures. The publication said: "To know where the vast majority of other missing American prisoners of war are, the clue should not be sought in 'atrocities,' but in the tragic course of the Korean War that has occurred in the past year." The "National Guardian Weekly" quoted the following: "The Department of Defense reported on December 7, 1950, that the number of people missing in action was 5,062, but this figure 'did not include the many casualties suffered last Sunday' (New York Times). On February 7, 1951, when the United Nations forces were driven back from the Yalu River to the 38th parallel, the 'missing' figure had increased to 9,433. In fact, during this retreat, entire companies of troops were almost completely annihilated, and those killed in battle were abandoned in certain areas, which the United Nations forces never managed to recapture."
    The American "Christian Science Monitor" also expressed doubts about the US official's published "missing" figures on December 19th. The newspaper said: "Given the nature of the Korean War, could the Allied forces' estimated figures themselves be unrealistically high?" Although the newspaper attributed the "certain degree of falsehood" of the US figures to "because Allied forces often publish figures without properly measuring the facts," the facts cited by the newspaper clearly illustrate the shameless trickery of the US side in deliberately fabricating false figures. The newspaper said: "When a battalion of the US 2nd Division was surrounded and annihilated at the end of November 1950, the estimated loss was over 800 people. The largest portion of these personnel was listed as 'missing in action,' but in fact, when the Chinese Communist forces made five consecutive attacks on this surrounded battalion, some officials believed that perhaps half of the battalion had already died." The newspaper said: "The Allied Command is somewhat in a dilemma. According to the system, the Allied forces were forced to list personnel as missing in action. However, the Allied forces knew privately that most of these personnel had probably died."

### 美国“国民前卫周刊”等报刊  揭露美方“失踪”数字的虚妄  指出美方一贯将伤亡列入“失踪”

    揭露美方“失踪”数字的虚妄
    指出美方一贯将伤亡列入“失踪”
    【新华社十六日讯】在朝鲜停战谈判中，美方曾以他们自己发表的所谓“失踪”数字为根据，来否定朝中方面提出的俘虏数字，为拖延谈判寻找藉口。但是，这种论据是完全站不住脚的。事实上，美方为了掩盖他们在侵朝战争中的惨重损失，在过去一贯把许多在战斗中被击毙的人数列入“失踪”项下。这一事实，已为美国报纸所揭露无遗。
    美国“国民前卫周刊”在一九五一年十二月二十六日出版的一期中，揭露了美国政府所发表的“失踪”数字的虚妄，该刊说：“要知道其余大多数失踪的美国战俘到底是在什么地方，这个线索不应该从‘暴行’方面去找，而应该从过去一年中所发生的朝鲜战争的悲惨过程中去找。”“国民前卫周刊”援引以下的话：“国防部在一九五○年十二月七日报告说，在作战中失踪的人数为五千零六十二人，但是这个数字中‘并没有包括在上星期的星期日所遭到的许多伤亡人数’（纽约时报）。在一九五一年二月七日，当联合国军队从鸭绿江边被击退到三八线时，‘失踪’数字曾增加到九千四百三十三人。事实上在这次退却中，整连的军队差不多全部被歼，在战斗中死亡的人被遗弃在某些地区，这些地区联合国军后来始终没有夺回过来。”
    美国“基督教科学箴言报”也在十二月十九日对美国官方发表的“失踪”数字表示怀疑。该报说：“鉴于朝鲜战争的性质，联军估计数字的本身是否会高得不合实际？”该报虽然把美方数字的“某种程度上的虚妄”，归因于“由于联军常常未适当地衡量事实便发表数字”，但是，该报举出的事实清楚地说明了美方故意制造虚伪数字的无耻伎俩。该报说：“当美军第二师的一营人在一九五零年十一月末被围歼时，估计损失为八百人以上。这批人员的最大部分被列为‘在战斗中失踪’，但是事实上在中共军对这被围的一营人作五次连续的进攻时，若干官员相信：或许这营的一半人员已经死亡。”该报说：“联军司令部有点处于进退维谷之境。根据制度，联军曾被迫把人员列为在战斗中失踪。但是，联军私下知道这些人员中大部分可能已经死掉了。”
