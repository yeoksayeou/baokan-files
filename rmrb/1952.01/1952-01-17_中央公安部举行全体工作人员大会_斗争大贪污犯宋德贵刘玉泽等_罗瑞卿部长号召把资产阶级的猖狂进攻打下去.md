    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government held a struggle meeting on the 16th against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, attended by over five thousand cadres and staff members, thoroughly settling accounts with the crimes of major corruption offenders Song Degui, Liu Yuze, Xiao Shunhe, and others, powerfully striking back against the frenzied ideological attack of the bourgeoisie.
    This struggle meeting was convened after the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement entered a mass confession and denunciation climax in various units of the Ministry of Public Security. Over the past half-month, through repeated and in-depth ideological mobilization and the leading cadres at all levels taking the lead in self-examination, the broad masses have been mobilized, and most of the corrupt elements have been exposed. All cadres and staff members are extremely resentful of the crimes of corrupt elements and the evil influence of the bourgeoisie; in particular, they are filled with bitter hatred for Song Degui and Liu Yuze, the main culprits in the major timber corruption case, and the treacherous merchant Zhao Xiqiao, who colluded with them to steal state property, and have demanded that these criminals be severely punished according to the law.
    The struggle meeting concentrated on thoroughly settling accounts with the entire crimes of the six major corruption offenders Song Degui, Liu Yuze, Xiao Shunhe, Wang Zhen, Ma Fuyong, and Li Zhushou, who colluded with private merchants and jointly embezzled funds in the purchase of timber. Xu Zirong, Director of the General Office, first made an inspection report on the timber corruption case. He said: "In the process of going to the Northeast to purchase and transport timber, the corrupt elements Song Degui and Liu Yuze colluded with Zhao Xiqiao, the manager of the Donghua Freight Station, a treacherous merchant in Tianjin, and Yang Shengxiang, the owner of the Xiangli Timber Factory, a treacherous merchant in Beijing, using methods such as paying excessive transportation handling fees and storage fees to steal nine hundred million yuan of state property. From then on, Song, Liu, and other criminals completely turned into agents of the bourgeoisie within our ranks, living a decadent and degenerate bourgeois life, and used the stolen money to entertain guests and give gifts everywhere, corrupting a group of cadres with weak will. In the administrative office under their leadership, 80 percent of the people were infected with the poison of corruption. We request the government to severely punish Song and Liu for such serious crimes of harming the interests of the state and corrupting cadres, as well as Zhao, Yu, and other treacherous merchants for inciting cadres to steal state property! Other criminals should also be sentenced according to their crimes." After Director Xu finished his report, he escorted Song, Liu, and the other six criminals to the scene, and the atmosphere at the meeting immediately became激昂, with everyone shouting in unison: "Down with corrupt elements! Eliminate corruption!" "Shoot the major corruption offenders!" People rose up to accuse Song Degui, Liu Yuze, and other criminals of their crimes. Li Dezheng, Zhang Shuoming, and Liu Jiaying, cadres of the Administrative Office, pointed at the corrupt criminals and specifically exposed the evil deeds of Song Degui and Liu Yuze in corrupting and framing cadres, suppressing democracy, and undermining the anti-corruption struggle.
    The emotions of the staff members attending the meeting became increasingly激愤. Some people who were not clean themselves also confessed their acts of corruption and firmly expressed their determination to completely break with the major corruption offenders Song Degui, Liu Yuze, and others, and to thoroughly draw a line between themselves and bourgeois ideology. Sun Zhiwei, a clerk in the Administrative Office who was dragged down by the major corruption offenders Song Degui, Liu Yuze, and others, also excitedly asked the chairman of the meeting to allow him to accuse Song, Liu, and others of their crimes. Sun Zhiwei said: "When purchasing timber in the Northeast, Song Degui would always pull a few of us who went with him to the Northeast along with him whenever he had a big feast; when we returned from the Northeast, Song also gave each of us 600,000 yuan, saying it was a bonus for us. At that time, because I was also severely corrupted by bourgeois ideology, I accepted this money, which dragged me down as well. Now, with the help of my comrades, I have woken up and realized Song's shameful conspiracy." Yang Shu, Song Degui's wife, and Zhao Qunlan, Liu Yuze's wife, also accused Song and Liu on the spot. Yang Shu said: "I did not adopt the attitude that a Communist Party member should have towards Song Degui's acts of corruption, and my own thinking also began to become corrupted and degenerate. In the past, I also knew that Song Degui had engaged in acts of stealing state property, but I did not report Song's corruption and degeneration to the organization in a timely manner. Therefore, Song has developed to the point where he seriously endangers the interests of the state and the people today. I hereby declare once again that I resolutely break off my marital relationship with Song Degui, the traitor of the people, and I will also educate my children to hate Song Degui's shameful crimes of endangering the people's cause." Zhao Qunlan said sadly: "I myself am also guilty, because I have been trapped in the circle of Liu's corruption and degeneration for a long time, and I have become deeply mired in it myself. If the Party had not saved me, I would have become a sinner against the people as well. I resolutely break off my marital relationship with Liu and resolutely stand on the side of the people."
    The mood of the masses' accusations became increasingly high, with forty-eight people requesting to make accusations on the spot. Those who did not have time to make accusations wrote accusation letters on the spot, and more than 480 people signed the accusation letters. They all expressed their determination to thoroughly eliminate the major and minor corrupt elements from the public security departments.
    The struggle meeting further exposed the insidious influence of the bourgeoisie. The comrades who participated in the timber case inspection team revealed in detail that the treacherous merchant Zhao Xiqiao adopted extremely despicable means to seduce and corrupt cadres in every possible way, and then colluded with these degenerated elements to steal state property. Last spring, when Xiao Shunhe went to Tianjin to purchase and transport timber, Zhao Xiqiao took him to his home; when Xiao fell ill, Zhao Xiqiao arranged for his two wives to take turns serving him day and night; the deputy manager Yu Zishan also found prostitutes for Xiao Shunhe and opened a room for him. Zhao Xiqiao then stole 539 million yuan of timber funds from Xiao Shunhe, who had already degenerated. Xiao Shunhe also introduced Song Degui to Zhao Xiqiao, saying that Song was "generous with money and liked flattery"; Zhao Xiqiao seized on these weaknesses of Song Degui and attacked him, saying: "If I take good care of Director Song, I won't have any problems enjoying myself for the rest of my life." Song Degui liked to drink, and Zhao Xiqiao invited him to restaurants every day. From then on, Song Degui became muddled and did not distinguish between his own and others' money when spending and doing things. On April 27th last year in the Northeast, Song Degui asked Zhao Xiqiao to contract for the transportation of timber, and Zhao suggested breaking railway regulations and smuggling timber. According to regulations, each car was only allowed to load 25 cubic meters, but they loaded 30 cubic meters. Zhao Xiqiao made 700 million yuan from this. Zhao was greedy and insatiable, and in order to steal more state property, he further colluded with Song Degui, treating Song as the "old boss" of the Donghua Freight Station. In order to win Song's favor and make him sink deeper and deeper, he invited him to eat "female waitresses" at many banquets. He was even more attentive in inviting him to eat and drink, and giving him money and gifts. Dining alone cost 160 to 170 million yuan, and bribery amounted to more than 130 million yuan. At the "Celebration Meeting for the Victory of Timber Procurement," the treacherous merchants Zhao Xiqiao and Yu Zishan arrogantly clinked glasses with Song and shouted: "Long live Director Song!" Song was so happy that he lost his mind and regarded Zhao Xiqiao as a "confidant," and introduced many cadres to Zhao Xiqiao as "friends." Zhao then further bribed these people, attempting to drag more people down.
    Hearing the vivid facts of the bourgeoisie's attack, the crowd was filled with 激愤, shouting slogans such as "Severely punish the treacherous merchant Zhao Xiqiao!" and "Repel the reactionary attack of the bourgeoisie!"
    The struggle meeting adjourned after Minister Luo Ruiqing's speech.

    中央公安部举行全体工作人员大会
    斗争大贪污犯宋德贵刘玉泽等
    罗瑞卿部长号召把资产阶级的猖狂进攻打下去
    【本报讯】中央人民政府公安部全体干部和工作人员五千余人，在十六日举行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争大会，彻底清算了大贪污犯宋德贵、刘玉泽、萧顺和等六犯的罪行，有力地回击了资产阶级思想的猖狂进攻。
    这个斗争大会，是反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动在公安部各单位分别进入群众性坦白检举高潮后召开的。半个月来，经过反复深入的思想动员、各级领导干部层层带头检查，广大群众已经发动起来，贪污分子大部被揭发出来了。全体干部和工作人员对贪污分子的罪行和资产阶级的罪恶影响，都极为痛恨；特别是对木材大贪污案的首犯宋德贵、刘玉泽，及与他们相勾结盗窃国家财产的奸商赵溪桥，更无不切齿痛恨，纷纷要求依法严惩这些罪犯。
    斗争大会集中地彻底地清算了大贪污犯宋德贵、刘玉泽、萧顺和、王珍、马福永、李祝寿等六犯在购买木材中，勾结私商、合伙贪污的全部罪行。办公厅徐子荣主任首先作了木材贪污案的检查报告。他说：贪污分子宋德贵、刘玉泽在去东北购运木材过程中，勾结天津奸商东华货栈经理赵溪桥、余子善和北京奸商祥利木厂老板杨生祥，用多付运输手续费、保管费的方法，盗窃国家财产九亿元。宋、刘等犯从此完全变成了资产阶级在我们内部的代理人，过着资产阶级腐朽的堕落的生活。并且用盗来的赃款到处请客送礼，腐蚀了一批意志薄弱的干部。在他们领导下的行政处，百分之八十的人都染上了贪污的污毒。对宋、刘二犯这样严重损害国家利益、腐蚀干部的罪行，赵、余等奸商勾引干部盗窃国家财产的罪行，我们请求政府予以严厉的惩办！对于其他各犯也应根据他们的罪行分别判罪。徐主任报告完毕，即将宋、刘等六犯押解到场，顿时会场群情激昂，齐声高呼：“打倒贪污分子！消灭贪污现象！”“枪毙大贪污犯！”人们群起争先控诉宋德贵、刘玉泽等犯的罪行。行政处干部李德正、张说明、刘嘉英手指贪污罪犯，具体揭发了宋德贵、刘玉泽腐蚀和陷害干部、压制民主，破坏反贪污斗争的罪恶事实。
    到会的工作人员的情绪愈来愈激愤。一些身上不干净的人，也坦白了自己的贪污行为，坚决表示要和大贪污分子宋德贵、刘玉泽等彻底分家，和资产阶级的思想彻底划清界限。被大贪污犯宋德贵、刘玉泽等拖下水的行政处办事员孙志伟，也非常激动地要求大会主席，允许他控诉宋、刘等犯的罪行。孙志伟说：在东北采购木材时，宋德贵每次大吃大喝的时候，就要拉上我们随他去东北的几个人；从东北回来时，宋并且还送给我们每人六十万元，说是给我们的奖金。当时因为自己也受了资产阶级思想的严重腐蚀，就接收了这笔款子，使自己也被拖下水。现在我在同志们的帮助之下清醒了，认识了宋犯这种可耻的阴谋。”宋德贵的妻子杨淑和刘玉泽的妻子赵群兰，也当场控诉宋、刘二犯。杨淑说：“我对待宋德贵的贪污罪行，采取的不是共产党员所应有的态度，自己的思想也开始腐化堕落。在过去，我也知道宋德贵有盗窃国家资财的行为，但是没有及时地向组织上报告宋犯的贪污腐化的情况。因此，使宋犯发展到今天，严重地危害了国家人民的利益。我在这里再一次声明，坚决和人民的叛徒宋德贵脱离夫妇关系，我并且要教育我的儿女起来仇恨宋德贵这种危害人民事业的可耻罪行。”赵群兰沉痛地说：“我自己也有罪恶，因为我长期陷于刘犯的贪污腐化的生活的圈子里，自己也已经陷得很深了。如果不是党挽救我，我也同样要成为人民的罪人。我坚决和刘犯脱离夫妇关系，坚决站在人民的立场上。”
    群众控诉情绪愈发高涨，要求当场控诉的有四十八人，来不及控诉的，就当场写了控诉书，在控诉书上签名的有四百八十多人，他们纷纷表示要把大大小小的贪污分子从公安部门彻底肃清。
    斗争大会更揭发了资产阶级的恶毒影响。参加木材案检查组的同志，详尽地揭露了奸商赵溪桥，采取极端卑鄙的手段，百般勾引腐化干部，然后勾结这些蜕化分子，盗窃国家财产。去年春天，萧顺和去天津购运木材，赵溪桥将他接到家中；萧病了，赵溪桥便布置他的两个老婆昼夜轮番服侍；副经理于子善并给萧顺和找妓女，开房间。赵溪桥就从已经蜕化了的萧顺和手里，盗去木材款五亿三千九百万元。萧顺和并把宋德贵介绍给赵溪桥说：宋为人“化钱大方，喜好奉承”；赵溪桥抓住了宋德贵的这些弱点，向他进攻，说是：“我把宋处长侍候好了，这一辈子享乐就不成问题了。”宋德贵好喝酒，赵溪桥每天请他下馆子。宋德贵从此就昏头昏脑，化钱做事不分你我。去年四月二十七日在东北，宋德贵叫赵溪桥包运木材，赵就出主意破坏铁路规章，偷运木材。照章每车皮只准装二十五立方米，他们却装了三十立方米。赚了钱，赵溪桥便从中捞去七亿元。赵贪得无厌，为了更大量地盗窃国家财产，进一步和宋德贵勾结，把宋当作东华货栈的“老掌柜”侍候着。为了博得宋的欢心，并使他愈陷愈深，在多次的宴会上，都请他吃“女招待”。请吃请喝、送钱送礼更加殷勤，单吃饭一项就化一亿六七千万，行贿一项即达一亿三千万以上。在“庆祝采购木材胜利大会”上，奸商赵溪桥、于子善狂妄地与宋碰杯高呼：“宋处长万岁！”宋乐得得意忘形，更把赵溪桥看作“心腹人”，把不少干部介绍给赵溪桥作“朋友”，赵就进一步向这些人行贿，企图拖更多的人下水。
    听到资产阶级进攻的活生生的事实，群情激愤，高呼：“严办奸商赵溪桥！”“打退资产阶级反动的进攻！”等口号。
    斗争大会在罗瑞卿部长讲话后散会。
