    Those Loyal to the Motherland
    Níng Gàn
    Before the New Year, I left the Korean battlefield and returned to the motherland, immediately throwing myself into the vigorous struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. During my time in Korea, I often felt that the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were loyal to the motherland. They not only fought for the motherland, even shedding blood and sacrificing their lives in battle, but also, as people of noble character and a high sense of responsibility, cherished the property of the motherland more than their own lives. No matter how arduous and dangerous the environment, they fought bravely to protect ammunition and supplies. They knew that every gun, every bullet, even every grain of rice, was earned by the sweat and blood of the people of the motherland. They knew that the people of the motherland sent these ammunition and supplies to the Korean front so that they could use them well to eliminate the American aggressors, in order to better carry out the construction of the motherland. They knew that they should be loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people of the motherland. In the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, I often think of some things on the Korean battlefield, especially the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—those loyal to the motherland.
    One cold night in late October last year, I took a car to the front line. As our car crossed a large mountain and reached a small plain next to a small river, unfortunately, the bridge over the river had been destroyed by enemy aircraft an hour earlier. In a short while, more than a hundred cars were stuck north of the river. Each car was loaded with grain, ammunition, and other supplies, urgently needed at the front. Everyone knew that this was a place frequently visited by enemy aircraft, and staying for a long time was dangerous, so everyone was very anxious. With the bridge broken, cars detoured to the right of the bridge, wading through the river, but the water was deep and the road dangerous, so only one car could pass at a time. In front of us was a medium-sized truck, empty, without any cargo, seemingly returning after completing its delivery mission. As this car crossed the river, suddenly gunfire rang out. "Airplane, lights off!" someone shouted from behind. The driver quickly turned off the lights, but it was too late. At this moment, a long burst of machine gun fire exploded above our heads, followed by dozens of flares hanging in the air. Under the light of the flares, the more than a hundred cars on the road behind, like a long dragon, were clearly visible, unable to move forward or backward, while the enemy aircraft "rattled" overhead. At this time, the cars that had crossed the river were not in danger and could turn off their lights and take advantage of the flares to drive away quickly. But the medium-sized truck that had crossed the river turned on its headlights, put on full throttle, and sped forward like an arrow. As a result, the enemy aircraft followed that truck and fired burst after burst of machine gun bullets, but the truck was still speeding... Farther and farther away, we could still see the flashing lights; later, even the lights could not be seen, only the "dong dong" of the enemy aircraft's machine guns sweeping; after that, even the sweeping sounds could not be heard, and the flares overhead went out, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
    "Which unit's car? Well done!" An atmosphere of admiration and gratitude enveloped everyone in the more than one hundred cars. When our car crossed the river and drove along the road for forty li, ah! We found the medium-sized truck parked by the roadside. We stopped the car and jumped out, and saw the driver lying softly on the driver's seat, fresh blood flowing from his left arm through his cotton clothes... We quickly bandaged his wound. People from the cars behind also jumped out to ask how his injury was, but he seemed not to hear, only asking, "Did the cars behind suffer any losses?" When someone told him that the cars had not suffered any losses, under the twinkling starlight, I saw him smile with satisfaction. This moved us very much. He said, "As long as our things and people haven't suffered any losses, that's good." After a pause, he continued, "These things of ours don't come easily! I've been driving in Korea for more than a year, and I often go back to the motherland, so I know the situation in the motherland. How frugal and hardworking the people of the motherland are, doing extra labor to support us! The mother of a driver in our team came to see him from Shenyang. This old lady's family didn't make new cotton clothes this winter, and couldn't bear to eat a meal of white flour for half a year. She's already over sixty years old, but in order to donate airplanes and artillery to support the People's Volunteer Army, she still works two extra hours of night shift in a shoe factory." Speaking of this, he slowed down a little: "As soon as I return to the motherland to haul things, I remember that these things are not easy, they are the blood and sweat of the people of the motherland, produced and saved to support us! Just take the situation just now, I thought at the time: driving fast and running away would be good, but would that work? The supplies in more than a hundred cars, how much blood and sweat of the people of the motherland is that! Besides, the soldiers crawling in the trenches need these things so much! Anyway, my car is an empty car, returning after completing its mission, even if it gets hit, it's much better than hitting so many things. Therefore, I hardened my heart and turned on the lights and ran. No matter how cunning the enemy's aircraft are, they fell into my trap."
    Such examples are not unique. If you have been to Korea, you will know that in Korea there are thousands upon thousands of such driver comrades who, in order to protect the property of the country, do not hesitate to sacrifice their personal lives.
    The next day we arrived at a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. One night, a staff officer led us to the position of a certain battalion. The enemy constantly fired artillery at every gully and intersection behind our position, hindering our supply to the front-line positions. As we entered the mouth of a gully, the staff officer instructed us to run past quickly, because this was where the enemy's artillery could reach. There were a dozen or so soldiers in front of us, running past with things on their backs; as we ran past, we saw two soldiers squatting there, not knowing what they were doing. The staff officer asked:
    "Why are you stopping here?"
    "It's broken, the rice bag broke open, and rice is scattered all over the ground." The soldiers were still calmly picking up the rice. We didn't say anything more, and ran past to rest under a cliff. At this time, a volley of shells exploded behind us, and we were worried about those two soldiers, but in a little while, the two of them came up with things on their backs. I greeted them to come here and rest, and the staff officer asked them:
    "Which unit are you from?"
    "The First Detachment."
    "Did you pick up all the rice?"
    "We picked it up!"
    "It's really dangerous for you to pick up rice there!" one of our messengers said carelessly.
    "What does danger matter! How did this rice of ours come about? Last year we ate fried noodles, and the people of the motherland knew we were suffering, and now they are completely transporting rice to us. This is not easy to transport... A few days ago, Comrade Dou Shaoqi, the representative of the Volunteer Army returning to the country, reported that there was an old man in Changsha, who was already over seventy years old, who voluntarily carried two loads of water every day, selling it for several hundred yuan to support us. Can we bear it in our hearts? How should we answer the people of the motherland? We must fight well to answer them, but if we don't cherish the things that the people of the motherland exchanged for blood and sweat, how can we be worthy of the people of the motherland?"
    "Take another look here!" Another soldier pointed to the fertile field in front of him and said: "Some of the land of the Korean people is not planted, and some that is planted cannot be harvested. The people can't eat or wear enough, but they still help us build roads and deliver food with all their might... How difficult it is!"
    Our soldiers are so great and lovable, no matter how dangerous and difficult the situation, the first thing they think of is not themselves, but the motherland and the people.
    It was a rainy and snowy dusk. I and Section Chief Li of the Propaganda Section of a certain division were treading on the muddy mountain road to the political commissar of the regiment. Section Chief Li introduced the situation of the political commissar of the regiment to me, saying: "In the Fifth Campaign, he was so tired that he vomited blood, and returned to the motherland for recuperation. At that time, I lived in the same hospital with him. The people of the motherland took care of us so well, but the regimental political commissar could not stay at ease, and wanted to come back before his illness was cured. The doctor said: 'The conditions in the rear are good, so you should recuperate in the rear for a few more days.' The regimental political commissar said: 'The conditions in the rear are good, but the comrades in my regiment are fighting hard at the front. Can I stay here if I leave them?' As a result, he still came back." The shelter of the regimental political commissar was at the foot of a mountain, small and damp, with a marching bed occupying half the space. In front of the bed was a small table nailed together from canned food boxes, with a candle burning on it. He was reading a book by the candlelight. Seeing us come in, he put down the book—a newly published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," poured a glass of water, and handed it to me warmly, saying apologetically:
    "Please have a glass of plain water!"
    I looked at his sallow face, his red-rimmed eyes sunken due to overwork, looked at this glass of plain water, and then at the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." I had an unspeakable feeling in my heart, and I said: "You are grasping your studies very tightly!"
    "There, it's completely guerrilla-style, we seize the time to pick it up and read it." He paused for a moment and then said: "To be honest, it's really not good if we don't seize the time to study now." He lit a cigarette and continued: "Putting aside everything else, just take the current situation of our troops, it's no longer the era of millet plus rifles. We have airplanes, tanks, and artillery. When I see these weapons, I think of the powerful economic strength of the motherland. Our new country is only two years old, and our people have done so many things: donating airplanes and artillery to support the Korean front, repairing the Huai River and completing such a large project, building a strong national defense, and carrying out land reform throughout the country... The achievements of construction are really not small! But this is still a very, very long way from our ideal communist society! In order to build this road, the people of the motherland are all saving money and working hard, increasing production, and creating more wealth for the motherland.
    We often think: we cannot produce for the motherland, but we can save. Our main method of saving is to fight well, use less guns and bullets, and annihilate more enemies. To fight well, as a commander, is it okay not to study hard? That would be too unfair to the motherland!"
    Comrades, friends! The infinite loyalty of the commanders and fighters of the People's Volunteer Army to the motherland and the people cannot be fully written or spoken. When you hear the stories of these people who are loyal to the motherland, what kind of feeling will you have? You say, in our country, are those acts of stealing and wasting state property, those bureaucratic acts that cause serious losses to state property, tolerable? If you realize a common responsibility from these stories, then please bravely stand at the forefront and wage a resolute struggle to protect the property of the great motherland, and against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy!

    忠于祖国的人们
    寗干
    新年前，我离开朝鲜战场回到祖国来，立刻投入了轰轰烈烈的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中。在朝鲜的一些日子里，我常常感觉人民志愿军的同志们都是忠于祖国的人。他们不仅为祖国而战斗，甚至在战斗中流血牺牲；而且这些具有高尚的品质和高度责任心的人们，他们爱护祖国的财产更甚于自己的生命。不管在如何艰苦和危险的环境中，他们都是奋不顾身地为保护弹药物资而进行斗争。他们知道，一枝枪，一颗子弹，甚至一粒米，都是祖国人民的血汗换来的。他们知道，祖国的人民把这些弹药物资送到朝鲜前线来，是要他们好好地运用它们去消灭美国侵略者，以便可以更好地进行祖国的建设。他们知道，应该忠于祖国，忠于祖国的人民。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大的斗争中，我常常想起朝鲜战场上的一些事物，尤其想念人民志愿军的同志们——那些忠于祖国的人们。
    去年十月下旬的一个寒冷的夜晚，我乘车到前线去。当我们的汽车翻过一座大山，到达一片小平原上的一条小河旁边时，不凑巧，小河上的桥在一小时前被敌机炸毁了。一会儿，小河北面就顶住了一百多辆汽车。每辆汽车上都载着满满的粮食弹药等物资，急于运上前线。谁都知道，这里是敌机经常出没的地方，久停是有危险的，因此，大家都很焦急。桥坏了，汽车绕到桥右侧从河水中涉过去，但是水深路险，只能一辆一辆地过。在我们前面的是一辆中型卡车，空空的，没载东西，看样子是完成了送东西的任务以后开回来的。当这辆车开过了河时，忽然枪声响了。“飞机，闭灯！”后面有人在叫。司机同志赶紧闭灯，但已迟了，这时长长的一梭子机关炮弹在我们头顶的上空爆炸开来，紧接着几十个照明弹也挂起来了。在照明弹光亮下，后面公路上的那一百多辆车，像一条长龙，清清楚楚地躺在那里，前开不动，后退不了，而敌机又“轧轧”的飞过来了。这时，过了河的车子是没有危险的，正可以不开灯，借照明弹的光，开快车跑开。但是过了河的那辆中型卡车却打亮了大灯，开足了马力，像箭一样向前飞驰而去。于是，敌机就紧跟着那辆卡车冲过去，一梭子一梭子的机关炮弹就打开了，可是，那辆卡车仍然在飞跑……远了，我们还看见那闪烁的灯光；后来，连灯光也看不到了，只听到敌机的机关炮还在“咚咚”的扫射着；再后，扫射声也听不到了，头上的照明弹也熄灭了，大家才松了口气。
    “哪部分的车？好样儿的！”一种敬佩感激的气氛，笼罩了一百多辆车上的每一个人。当我们的车子开过了河，顺着公路跑了四十里的光景，啊！我们发现了那辆中型卡车停在路边。我们停车跳下去，看见那位司机同志软软地躺在司机台上，鲜血从左臂上透过棉衣流出来……我们赶紧把他的伤口包扎起来。后面来的车上也有人跳下来问他的伤怎么样了，但他好像没有听见似的，只是问：“后面的车受了损失没有？”当有人对他说车没有损失时，在闪闪的星光下，我看到他满意地笑了。这使我们非常感动。他说：“只要我们的东西和人没有受损失就好了。”停了一下，他继续说下去：“我们这些东西来得不容易呀！我到朝鲜开车一年多了，常常回祖国去，我是知道祖国的情况的。祖国人民是怎样地省吃俭用，增加额外的劳动来支援我们呀！我们队上一个司机的母亲从沈阳来看他，这位老太太一家人今冬都没做新棉衣，半年也舍不得吃顿白面，她已经六十多岁了，但是为了捐献飞机大炮支援人民志愿军，他还在鞋厂里加了两个钟头的夜班呢。”说到这里，他把话放慢了一点：“我一回到祖国拉东西，就想起来啦，这些东西不是容易的，这是祖国人民一滴血一滴汗地生产节约，支援我们的呀！就按方才的情况说吧，我当时想：开快车跑了正好，但那行吗？一百多辆车的物资，是祖国人民的多少血汗呀！再说，战士们爬在战壕里是多么需要这些东西呀！反正我这个车是个空车，完成任务向回开的，就是被打着了吧，总比打着那么多的东西要好得多。因此，我把心一横，就打着灯跑起来了，鬼子的飞机再狡猾，也上了我的圈套了。”
    这样的例子并不是绝无仅有的，倘若你到过朝鲜，你就会知道，在朝鲜有成千成万的这样的司机同志，为了爱护国家的财物，毫不吝惜个人生命。
    第二天我们到达了志愿军某部。一天夜里，一位参谋同志领我们到某营的阵地上去。敌人不时地用炮火射击我阵地后面的每一条山沟和路口，阻挠我们对前沿阵地的供给。当我们进入一个山沟口时，参谋同志嘱咐我们快跑过去，因为这里是敌人的炮火可以打到的。在我们前面有十几个战士，背着东西跑过去了；当我们跑过去时，看到有两个战士蹲在那里，不知在搞什么。参谋同志就问道：
    “怎么在这里停下来啦？”
    “坏啦，米袋摔开啦，撒了一地大米。”战士们仍然不慌不忙地在那里收拾大米。我们没有再往下说，就跑过去，到一个山崖下歇脚去了。这时一排炮弹在后面爆炸了，我们在为那两位战士耽心，但是一会儿，他们两人就背着东西上来了。我招呼他们也来这里休息休息，参谋同志问他们：
    “你们是哪部分的？”
    “一大队的。”
    “大米都拾起来了吗？”
    “拾起来啦！”
    “你们在那里拾米真危险呀！”我们的一个通讯员不经心地说。
    “危险算什么！我们这大米是怎么来的呀？去年我们吃炒面，祖国人民知道我们苦，现在完全给我们运大米来了，这是好不容易运来的呀……前几天志愿军的归国代表窦少毅同志报告，讲到长沙有一个老头儿，年纪已经七十多了，每天还自愿地挑两担水，卖几百块钱拿来支援我们，我们心里忍吗？我们怎样回答祖国人民呢？我们要打好仗回答他们，但是我们对祖国人民用血汗换来的东西，不加爱护，那能对得起祖国的人民吗？”
    “再看看这里！”另一个战士指着面前那肥沃的田地说：“朝鲜老百姓的地有的没有种上，有的种了又不能收割，老百姓吃不上，穿不上，可是还是一个劲地帮助我们修路、送粮……多不容易啊！”
    我们的战士们就是这样的伟大而可爱，无论在多么危险和艰苦的情况下，他们首先想到的不是自己，而是祖国和人民。
    那是一个雨雪交加的黄昏。我同某师宣传科李科长踏着泥泞的山路，到团政治委员那里去。李科长向我介绍团政治委员的情况说：“在第五次战役中，他累得吐了血，回到祖国去休养，当时和我住在一个医院里。祖国人民对我们的照顾太好啦，但团政委住不安，病还没好就要回来。医生说：‘后方条件好，还是在后方多休养几天吧。’团政委说：‘后方条件是好，但我那一团的同志们，在前方拚死拚活，我离开了他们，住得下去吗？’结果，他还是回来啦。”团政治委员的掩蔽部在一个山脚下，狭小而潮湿，一个行军床就占了一半地方，床前有一个用罐头箱钉成的小桌，桌上燃着一只蜡烛。他正在蜡前看书，看见我们进去后，他放下书——那是一本新出版的“毛泽东选集”，倒了杯水，热情地递给我，抱歉似的说：
    “请喝杯白水吧！”
    我望了望他那黄瘦的脸上由于疲劳过度而陷下去的红丝丝的眼睛，看了看这杯白水，再看看那本“毛泽东选集”，我的心中有一种说不出的感觉，我说：“你们学习抓得很紧哪！”
    “那里，完全是游击式的，有空就抓起来看看。”他沉吟了一下又说：“说实在的，现在不抓紧学习，可真不行啦。”他点了枝烟，又接着说下去：“不说别的，就按我们部队当前的情况来说吧，已经不是小米加步枪的时代了，我们有了飞机、坦克、大炮。我看到了这些武器，就想到祖国的经济力量的强大。我们的新国家才两年，我们的人民就干了那么多的事：捐献飞机大炮支援朝鲜前线，修淮河完成那么大的工程，建设强大的国防，在全国进行了土地改革……建设的成绩可真不小！但这离我们理想的共产主义社会还有很长很长的路程啊！为了建设这条路，祖国的人民都在省吃俭用，努力劳动，增加生产，为祖国创造更多的财富。
    我们常常想：我们不能为祖国生产，却能节约，我们节约的主要方法，就是打好仗，少用枪炮子弹，多歼灭敌人。要打好仗，作为一个指挥员来说，不好好学习行吗？那太对不起祖国啦！”
    同志们，朋友们！人民志愿军的指挥员和战斗员对祖国、对人民的无限忠诚是写也写不尽，说也说不完的。当你们听到这些忠于祖国的人们的故事时，你们会有什么样的感觉呢？你们说，在我们的国家里面，那些盗窃和浪费国家财产的行为，那些造成国家财产严重损失的官僚主义的行为难道是能够容忍的吗？如果你们从这些故事里意识到一种共同的责任的话，那么就请你们勇敢地站到最前列来，为保护伟大祖国的财产，为反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义进行坚决的斗争吧！
