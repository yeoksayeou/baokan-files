The "Literary Gazette" published on January 25th featured essays such as "Some Issues Concerning Rural Theaters" and "Attach Importance to the Leadership of Rural Theaters." These essays pointed out that some undesirable tendencies have long existed in the activities of rural theaters in various regions and urgently need to be corrected in a timely manner.

Many rural theaters in various regions are no longer propaganda organizations closely coordinating with political tasks, but have become "opera troupes" for purely entertainment purposes. Because the propaganda departments of the Communist Party organizations and the cultural and educational departments of the People's Governments in some areas have relaxed or even abandoned their leadership over rural theaters, and also due to the lack of new scripts with certain ideological content that are also popular with the masses in terms of form, many rural theaters are developing on the wrong path of performing old plays. In many areas, the proportion of old plays in the repertoire of rural theaters is increasing day by day, and in some cases, it reaches more than two-thirds. Some rural theaters even perform programs with toxic elements such as pornography and feudal consciousness. The peasants are dissatisfied with this phenomenon. They say, "This is not serving the people at all, it is simply an old opera troupe!" Some members of rural theaters also proposed to perform new plays, but those leading the theaters said, "We want to perform on harnessing the Huai River; you can't find anything about harnessing the Huai River in old plays!"

Due to a lack of correct understanding of the nature, principles, and tasks of rural theaters, many rural theaters are developing in the direction of "professionalization." Some rural theaters hire famous teachers to coach, and regardless of the audience and conditions, perform scripts such as "The Road to Officialdom," "Ideological Problems," and "Pavel Korchagin" for the peasants. They pursue gorgeousness in costumes and props. This hinders production, increases the burden on peasants, and creates serious extravagance and waste.

Now, during the Spring Festival, the activities of rural theaters will be active again. All regions should strengthen the leadership of rural theaters, correct the undesirable tendencies that have already occurred, and enable rural theaters to play their due role in the political and cultural life of rural areas.

### 文艺报评各地农村剧团工作

    文艺报评各地农村剧团工作
    一月二十五日出版的“文艺报”发表了“关于农村剧团的一些问题”、“重视农村剧团的领导工作”等论文，这些论文中指出，各地农村剧团的活动中已经长期地存在着一些不良的倾向，亟需及时地加以纠正。
    各地的农村剧团中，有许多已经不再是密切配合政治任务的宣传组织，而成为单纯娱乐性质的“戏班子”了。由于有些地区中共党组织的宣传部门和人民政府的文化教育部门放松甚至放弃了对农村剧团的领导，也由于缺乏有一定的思想内容而形式又为群众所喜闻乐见的新剧本，许多农村剧团正在向演旧剧的错误道路发展。有许多地区的农村剧团上演的剧目中旧剧的比重日益增加，有的竟达三分之二以上。还有些农村剧团甚至演出了带有色情和封建意识等有毒素的节目。农民对这种现象是不满意的，他们说：“这那里是为人民服务，简直是旧戏班子！”有的农村剧团团员也提出要演新剧，但领导剧团的人却说：“我们要演治淮，古戏里找不到治淮！”
    由于对农村剧团的性质、方针和任务缺乏正确的认识，许多农村剧团正向“专业化”方向发展。有些农村剧团聘请名师教练，不问对象和条件，向农民演出“升官图”、“思想问题”、“保尔·柯察金”等剧本。在服装道具上追求华美。这样就妨碍了生产，加重了农民的负担，形成了严重的铺张浪费。
    现在，春节期间，农村剧团的活动又将活跃。各地应当加强对农村剧团的领导，纠正已经产生的不良倾向，使农村剧团在农村的政治、文化生活中起应有的作用。　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
