On the Front Lines of the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy

The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League Holds Activist Conference
Calling on Youth to Expose Corrupt Elements

The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League held its Second Activist Conference for central-level government organizations on January 20th. Over 900 Youth League branch secretaries and cadres from central-level organizations attended. At the meeting, Luo Feng, secretary of the Central People's Government Youth League Committee, gave a report, calling on Youth League organizations, under the close leadership of the Party, to continue to mobilize the youth masses and do the following work well: 1. Publicize policies and dispel public concerns; 2. Participate in investigation work; 3. Under the leadership of the Party, actively assist the administration in various specific tasks; 4. Assist the Party and administration in organizing confession, exposure, and struggle meetings, and propaganda and mobilization work at the meetings. He pointed out: An important indicator of the quality of the Youth League's work in the anti-corruption struggle is whether it can mobilize the youth masses to expose corrupt elements.

After Holding a Struggle Session, the Ministry of Trade
Launches a Full-Scale Offensive Against Major Corrupt Officials

After the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government held a meeting on the 20th to struggle against major corrupt officials, the enthusiasm of the masses was even higher, putting great pressure on corrupt elements. Within half a day after the meeting, 319 people from various units under the Ministry of Trade confessed their corrupt acts, and 70 people who had made preliminary confessions further confessed. However, some corrupt elements remained hesitant, and a very small number of corrupt elements resisted the confession and exposure movement by rogue means. The austerity inspection committees of various units are now announcing at large and small meetings: Corrupt elements should quickly confess their problems and strive for voluntary confession; a full-scale offensive should be launched against major corrupt officials who are unwilling to confess.

Wuxi City Industrial and Commercial Circles Hold Confession and Exposure Meeting
Government Arrests Recalcitrant Profiteers on the Spot

The industrial and commercial circles of Wuxi City held a confession and exposure meeting on the 18th to oppose bribery, fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion, and invited representatives from government agencies and organizations to participate in the exposure. At this meeting, businessman Tao Keli confessed relatively thoroughly. Zhao Zhangji only initially admitted to illegal trading of gold and other crimes. Li Mengju was evasive and vague. He had organized eight hardware stores to sell hardware materials to the Southern Jiangsu Electric Power Bureau at prices three to nine times higher than the original price, thereby obtaining exorbitant profits of more than 1 billion yuan. Representatives of shop assistants and tax bureau cadres listed many facts proving that Zhao Zhangji and Li Mengju's confessions were attempts to deceive the people with false confessions.

At the meeting, Shen Yunzhang, president of the Municipal People's Court, announced on the spot: Zhao Zhangji avoided the important and dwelled on the trivial, and his confession was not thorough. He must continue to reflect, thoroughly confess, hand over all account books, and await disposition. Li Mengju's crimes were serious, and he resisted confession. It was decided to arrest him and bring him to justice.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    青年团中央召开积极分子大会
    号召发动青年群众检举贪污分子
    青年团中央在一月二十日召开第二次中央一级机关青年团积极分子大会，有中央一级机关团体的青年团支部书记以上干部九百余人参加。会上，由中央人民政府团委会书记洛风报告，号召青年团组织在党的密切领导下，继续深入发动青年群众，作好以下工作：一、宣传政策，解除群众顾虑；二、参加调查工作。三、在党的领导下主动协助行政担任各种具体工作。四、协助党与行政组织坦白、检举、斗争大会和会场上的宣传鼓动工作。他指出：在反贪污斗争中，团的工作好坏的一个重要标志，就是看是否能发动起青年群众把贪污分子揭露出来。
    中央贸易部开斗争大会后
    对大贪污犯展开全面猛攻
    中央人民政府贸易部在二十日召开斗争大贪污犯的大会后，群众情绪更为高涨，给贪污分子以很大的压力。会后半天之内，贸易部所属各单位，计有三百一十九人坦白了自己的贪污行为，七十个初步坦白的人，又进一步进行了坦白。但仍有一些贪污分子表现犹豫，并有极少数贪污分子以无赖的手段来抵抗坦白检举运动。现各单位节约检查委员会正在大会、小会上宣布：贪污分子应从速交代自己的问题，争取自动坦白；对不愿坦白的大贪污犯，要展开全面猛攻。
    无锡市工商界开坦白检举大会
    政府当场逮捕拒不坦白的奸商
    无锡市工商界在十八日举行反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏坦白检举大会，并邀请了机关、团体的代表参加检举。在这次大会上，商人陶可立坦白得比较彻底。赵章吉只初步承认了非法买卖黄金等罪行。李梦菊则支吾含糊，他曾组织八家五金商店以超过原价三倍至九倍的高价的五金器材卖给苏南电业局因而得到暴利十多亿元。到会的店员代表和税局干部列举了许多事实，证明赵章吉、李梦菊的坦白是企图用假坦白来蒙混人民的耳目。
    会上，市人民法院院长申云章当场宣布：赵章吉避重就轻、坦白不彻底，要他继续反省，彻底坦白，缴出所有账册，听候处理。李梦菊罪行重大，抗拒坦白，决定加以逮捕法办。
