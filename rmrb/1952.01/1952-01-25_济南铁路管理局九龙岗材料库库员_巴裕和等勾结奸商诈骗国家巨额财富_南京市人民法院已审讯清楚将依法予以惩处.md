Ji'nan Railway Bureau Jiulonggang Material Depot Storekeeper
Ba Yuhe and Others Collude with Unscrupulous Merchants to Defraud the State of Huge Amounts of Wealth
Nanjing People's Court Has Conducted a Clear Trial and Will Punish Them According to Law
Ba Yuhe, storekeeper of the Jiulonggang Material Depot of the Bengbu Branch of the Ji'nan Railway Bureau, colluded with Lin Zhiping, an unscrupulous merchant from Wuhu City, to inflate timber prices, causing a loss of over 440 million yuan in state property. After this case was discovered by the Bengbu Branch, the Nanjing People's Court conducted a trial and investigation, and the court will punish Ba Yuhe and other criminals according to the law.

In September 1950, the Bengbu Branch assigned Ba Yuhe to lead Huang Jihe, a clerk from the Materials Section, and Dong Qiang, a clerk from the Jiulonggang Machinery Factory, to Wuhu to purchase timber. Lin Zhiping, manager of Wuhu Yongfeng Timber Company, knew Huang Jihe in the past. As soon as Ba, Huang, and others arrived in Wuhu, Lin used means such as providing food and lodging, inviting them to bathe, watch plays, and taking them to prostitutes to try his best to win them over. Ba Yuhe, Huang Jihe, and others, in order to obtain huge bribes, vigorously praised Lin Zhiping to their superiors, and finally tricked them into approving and signing three timber purchase contracts with Lin Zhiping on two separate occasions, totaling over 1.34 billion yuan. In reality, this batch of timber, calculated at the highest market price at the time, was only worth 896.8 million yuan. The Ji'nan Railway Bureau thus lost 444.7 million yuan. Ba Yuhe, Huang Jihe, and others received a total of 120 million yuan in bribes.

The lax system of the Bengbu Branch and the bureaucratic work style of some cadres left loopholes for criminals to exploit. The chief of the Materials Section at the time also calculated that the price of the batch of goods was 300 to 400 million yuan higher than the market price, and he even made a trip to Nanjing himself. However, he did not conduct in-depth investigation and research. Starting solely from the task point of view, he was eager to get the goods as soon as possible to "complete the task." He blindly believed the lies and exaggerations of Ba, Huang, and other criminals, thinking that Lin Zhiping's goods were "top-quality West Lake Guang timber," "available in stock" (actually, there was no stock at all), and "trustworthy." He completely failed to consider that using West Lake Guang timber to build ordinary houses was a serious waste, nor did he consider that even according to the price of West Lake Guang timber, it was still more than 400 million yuan higher than the highest market price. He did not even consider whether there might be other malpractices, and he rashly agreed to the full price. Due to his serious irresponsible attitude, a large amount of state property was given to unscrupulous merchants and embezzlers.

The unscrupulous merchant Lin Zhiping hung up empty signboards such as "Yongfeng Timber Company," "Yongfeng Rice Mill," and "Yongfeng Farm" in Wuhu, but in reality, he had no capital at all. He shamelessly confessed during the interrogation: "I have no capital, people are the capital." Before liberation, he had consistently colluded with Liu Bingzhe, the commander of the 28th Army of the Chiang bandits, and Zhang Naixin, the commander of the 52nd Division, and recognized bandit Zhang as a "godfather." He used their money and force to speculate, hoard, and exploit the people's wealth. After liberation, he continued to use the above signboards to swindle and deceive in Wuhu, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. In this timber transaction, because he was determined to seize exorbitant profits, he used various despicable means to win over, entice, and corrupt Ba Yuhe and others as soon as they arrived. In addition, Ba Yuhe and others had developed serious corruption and decadent ideas in corrupt bureaucratic capitalist enterprises for a long time before liberation, and they were not reformed after liberation. This time they went to Wuhu with the intention of embezzlement, so both sides hit it off immediately.

Later, in order to expand his speculative organization, Lin illegally established the "Wuhu Yongfeng Farm Nanjing Office" in Nanjing in November 1950 and continued to solicit business from the Bengbu Branch. In March 1951, the Bengbu Branch sent personnel to negotiate with Lin Zhiping to purchase another batch of timber. Lin still used his consistent tricks to lure the purchasing personnel, and he inflated the price of goods worth only 480 million yuan at market price to 764.429 million yuan. The cadres who went to purchase timber this time had a firm position and were not tempted by the unscrupulous merchants. They conducted in-depth investigation and research, consulted prices with relevant public and private enterprises, and discovered Lin's crime of raising prices. They promptly reported this situation to the leading cadres of the Bengbu Branch. The leaders of the Bengbu Branch had heard the masses reflect that "Ba Yuhe and others made a fortune buying timber," so they attached great importance to this situation. They investigated, analyzed, and studied the past account, and closely contacted the Nanjing Native Produce Company and public security and judicial organs, and finally cracked the case.

    济南铁路管理局九龙岗材料库库员
    巴裕和等勾结奸商诈骗国家巨额财富
    南京市人民法院已审讯清楚将依法予以惩处
    济南铁路管理局蚌埠分局九龙岗材料库库员巴裕和为首勾结芜湖市奸商林治平，抬高木材价格，使国家财产损失四亿四千多万元。这个案件经蚌埠分局查获后，已由南京市人民法院审讯调查清楚；法院对巴裕和等犯即将依法惩处。
    一九五○年九月间，蚌埠分局指派巴裕和负责率领材料科科员黄季和和九龙岗机厂事务员董强到芜湖采购木材。芜湖永丰木号经理林治平和黄季和过去认识，巴、黄等一到芜湖，林就用供应食宿、请洗澡、看戏以及带他们嫖妓女等手段，竭力笼络。巴裕和、黄季和等为着获得巨额贿赂，便向上级极力为林治平吹嘘，终于骗得批准，先后两次和林治平签订购买木材合同三纸，总计价款十三亿四千多万元。实际上这批木料按当时市场的最高价格计算，也只能值八亿九千六百八十万元。济南铁路管理局因而损失四亿四千四百七十万元。巴裕和、黄季和等共得贿赂一亿二千万元。
    蚌埠分局的制度不严和某些干部的官僚主义作风，给犯罪分子留下了可乘之隙。材料科科长当时也曾核算出那批货的价格比市价高出三、四亿元，并且还亲自到南京去了一趟。但他并没有深入调查研究，只从单纯任务观点出发，急于把货早日弄到手好“交差”，便盲目听信巴、黄等犯的谎言吹嘘，认为林治平的货是“顶好的西湖广木”、又是“现货”（其实根本没一点现货）、又“有信用”等，完全不去考虑用西湖广木建筑普通房屋是严重的浪费，也不去考虑就是照西湖广木算也要比最高市价高出四亿多，更没有去考虑其中是不是会有其他弊病，便轻率地同意了全部价格。由于他这种严重的不负责任的态度，就把大批国家财产送给了奸商和贪污分子。
    奸商林治平在芜湖挂了“永丰木号”“永丰米厂”和“永丰农场”等空头招牌，实际上毫无资本。他自己在审讯中也曾厚颜无耻地自供：“我是没有资本的，人就是资本。”他在解放前就一贯地和蒋匪第二十八军军长刘秉哲和第五十二师师长张迺鑫相互勾结，并认张匪为“干亲家”，借他们的金钱和武力，投机倒把，榨取人民财富。他解放后仍然利用上述招牌，在芜湖、南京、上海等地招摇撞骗。在这批木材交易中，由于他存心攫取暴利，所以巴裕和等刚到，便用各种卑劣手段拉拢，引诱和腐蚀他们。加上巴裕和等解放前长期在腐败的官僚资本企业中养成了严重的贪污腐化思想，解放后没有得到改造，这次去芜湖本有贪污意图，所以双方一拍即合。
    后来林犯为了扩充投机组织，又在一九五零年十一月间在南京非法设立“芜湖永丰农场南京办事处”，仍向蚌埠分局兜揽生意。一九五一年三月间，蚌埠分局又派员向林治平洽购一批木料，林犯仍用一贯伎俩诱惑采购人员，并把市价仅值四亿八千多万元的货物的价格高抬到七亿六千四百四十二万九千元。这次去采购木材的干部立场很坚定，不受奸商的引诱，深入地调查研究，向各有关的公私营企业洽询价格，发现了林犯抬高价格的罪行。他们及时向蚌埠分局的领导干部反映了这个情况。蚌埠分局领导方面曾经听见群众反映“巴裕和等买木料发了财”，所以对这一情况也很重视，把过去的一笔旧账查出分析研究，并和南京土产公司和公安、司法机关密切联系，终于把这个案子破获。
