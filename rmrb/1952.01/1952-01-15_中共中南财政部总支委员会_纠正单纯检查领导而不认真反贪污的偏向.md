Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 12th. The General Branch Committee of the CCP Central-South Military and Political Committee Finance Department held a meeting of党员 cadres above the section chief level on the 9th to correct the department's tendency of simply inspecting the work and lifestyles of leading cadres and not seriously carrying out the anti-corruption struggle in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. The department had started by opposing the bureaucracy of leading cadres half a month ago, and initially mobilized the masses. However, it then remained for a long time in the stage of inspecting the leadership, such as giving opinions to the office director for seven days and giving opinions to the grain bureau director for eight days without ending, and these opinions mostly focused on general work and lifestyle aspects, relaxing the serious corruption and waste phenomena existing within the department. In addition, some middle-level leading cadres, because their hands were not clean, adopted a passive attitude towards the movement and did not offer opinions to each other, making it impossible to carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. In response to this situation, the person in charge of the general branch fully explained the significance of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy at the meeting, pointing out that those who are not active in the movement are either unclean or bureaucratic. The person in charge of the general branch demanded that leading cadres at all levels take the lead, set a deadline for launching the movement, and asked leading Party cadres at all levels to express their attitude on the spot, and those who have engaged in corruption and waste should conduct a self-criticism. When expressing their attitude in groups, the党员 cadres present confessed and reported on the spot. After the meeting, Party cadres at all levels immediately conducted in-depth self-criticism in their respective departments and actively mobilized their subordinates to confess and report. For example, in the Tax Bureau, after the Party's responsible cadres criticized themselves, more than 20 cadres confessed to corrupt acts.

    纠正单纯检查领导而不认真反贪污的偏向
    【新华社汉口十二日电】中共中南军政委员会财政部总支委员会在九日召开股长以上党员干部会议，纠正该部在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中单纯检查领导干部的工作生活作风，没有认真展开反贪污斗争的偏向。该部早在半月以前，就从反对领导干部的官僚主义着手，初步发动了群众。但随即长时间停留在对领导方面的检查阶段，如给办公室主任提了七天意见，给粮食局局长提了八天意见还没有结束，而且这些意见多半偏重在一般工作生活作风方面，放松了部内存在的严重的贪污、浪费现象。加上某些中层领导干部由于自己手上不干净，又对运动采取消极态度，互不提意见，使反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动不能开展。针对这种情况，总支负责人在会上充分说明了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的意义，指出对运动不积极的不是自己不干净，就是官僚主义分子。总支负责人要求各级负责干部带头，限期把运动展开，并要各级党员领导干部当场表示态度，有贪污、浪费行为的并要进行检讨。在分组表示态度时，到会的党员干部当场就进行坦白和检举。会后，各级党员干部即在各部门深刻检讨自己，积极发动所属干部坦白检举。如税务管理局在党员负责干部检讨自己后，就有二十多个干部坦白了贪污行为。
