Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. Washington and Tokyo simultaneously announced on January 16th a letter from Japanese reactionary government Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida to U.S. war-monger and State Department advisor John Foster Dulles on December 24th of last year. In this letter, Yoshida, violating the will of the Japanese people and openly antagonizing the Chinese people, abjectly obeyed the instructions of his American masters and announced that the Japanese government was prepared to conclude a so-called "bilateral treaty" with the Kuomintang remnant bandits in Taiwan according to the principles of the illegal U.S.-made separate peace treaty with Japan.

	In his letter, Yoshida openly declared his intention to establish "relations" with the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang, characterized by "complete peaceful coexistence politically, and trade." He said, "At present, we hope to establish this kind of relationship with the National Government of the Republic of China." "The Japanese government is prepared, as soon as the law permits, to conclude a treaty with the National Government of China—if it is willing—in order to rebuild normal relations between the two governments according to the principles put forward in the multilateral treaty" (referring to the illegal U.S.-made separate peace treaty with Japan). In his letter, Yoshida, ignoring the historic victory of the Chinese people and the reality that they are preparing to liberate Taiwan, pinned his hopes on the "restoration" of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang. He said: "Regarding the Republic of China, the terms of this bilateral treaty will apply to all territories now or hereafter under the jurisdiction of the National Government of the Republic of China." Yoshida's raving lunacy clearly exposes his sinister conspiracy to follow U.S. imperialism and attempt to carry out aggression against China once again.

	In the letter, Yoshida also blatantly expressed hostility and made wanton slanders against the great People's Republic of China. He cited the shameful resolution passed by the United Nations under the control of the United States, which slandered the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor," admitted that "Japan is now assisting in the implementation" of the aggressive measures taken by the United States against China and Korea under the guise of the United Nations, and stated that Japan will, upon the entry into force of the U.S.-made treaty, "continue to assist in the implementation of these measures" in accordance with the provisions of the treaty in order to sell out the interests of the Japanese people and serve the U.S. policy of expanding the Far East war of aggression.

	Yoshida's letter, which openly challenges the Chinese people, was obviously published under the orders of the U.S. government. Although the U.S. State Department has tried its best to deny that it was the product of U.S. pressure after the publication of Yoshida's letter, the irrefutable fact shows that this "guarantee" was extorted by Dulles himself during his visit to Japan. As early as mid-December last year, when Dulles visited Japan to meet with Yoshida, the United Press International revealed that one of Dulles's tasks on this trip was to "force the Japanese government to agree to sign a peace treaty with Nationalist China." On December 11th last year, Dulles publicly threatened Japan at a press conference in Tokyo, saying: "Japan says it is willing to establish relations with the CCP and is willing to conduct trade. I think this statement is a serious obstacle to the U.S. Senate's ratification of the treaty." It is obvious that it was at Dulles's request that Japan's traitorous Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida gladly signed and sealed this letter, which betrayed Japan for the benefit of U.S. imperialism.

	The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal representative of the Chinese people. Our Central People's Government's sacred right to conclude a peace treaty with Japan must not be erased or denied. Our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai reiterated on September 18th of last year that the Central People's Government considers the U.S.-made separate peace treaty with Japan to be illegal and invalid, and therefore absolutely unacceptable. Therefore, any treaty to be concluded by the reactionary Yoshida government with the Kuomintang remnant bandits is completely illegal and invalid, and it will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the Chinese people. The Yoshida government will undoubtedly not be able to escape its due responsibility for all the serious consequences arising from its pursuit of U.S. policy and illegal contacts with the Kuomintang remnant bandits.

    吉田卑贱地顺从美国竟拟与台湾残匪缔和
    【新华社二十二日讯】华盛顿和东京在一月十六日同时公布了日本反动政府首相吉田茂在去年十二月二十四日给美国战争贩子、国务院顾问杜勒斯的一封信。吉田在这封信中违反日本人民的意志并公开和中国人民为敌，卑贱地顺从其美国主子的吩咐，宣布日本政府准备根据非法的美制单独对日和约的原则，和台湾国民党残匪缔结所谓“双边条约”。
    吉田在他的信中，公然宣称要和国民党残余匪帮建立“政治上完全和平相处，并且通商”的“关系”，他说：“在目前，我们希望能与中华民国国民政府建立这种关系”，“日本政府准备一俟法律允许，就与中国国民政府——如果它愿意的话——缔结条约，以便按照多边和约（按指非法的美制单独对日和约）中提出的原则，重建两国政府间的正常关系。”吉田在他的信中，无视中国人民已经获得历史性的胜利以及他们正在准备解放台湾的这一现实，把他的希望寄托在国民党残余匪帮的“复辟”之上。他说：“关于中华民国方面，这个双边条约的条件将适用于现在或以后可能属中华民国国民政府管辖的全部领土。”吉田的这些梦呓，清楚地暴露了他追随美帝国主义，企图对中国再度进行侵略的罪恶阴谋。
    吉田在信中对于伟大的中华人民共和国，还明目张胆地表示了敌视的态度并进行了放肆的诬蔑。他引述了联合国在美国把持下通过的，诬蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的可耻决议，承认“日本现在正在协助执行”美国假借联合国名义对中国与朝鲜所采取的侵略措施，并表示日本在美制和约生效时，将根据该约的规定，“继续协助执行这些措施”来出卖日本人民的利益，为美国扩大远东侵略战争的政策而服务。
    吉田这封公开向中国人民挑战的信件，显然是在美国政府命令之下发表的。尽管美国国务院在吉田这封信公布之后竭力否认它是美国压力的产物，但是，无可辩驳的事实表明：这个“保证书”是杜勒斯亲自赴日勒索取得的。早在去年十二月中旬杜勒斯赴日与吉田会谈时，美国国际新闻社就曾透露，杜勒斯此行的任务之一是“强迫日本政府答应与国民党中国签订和约”。去年十二月十一日杜勒斯在东京招待记者会上，公开向日本提出威胁说：“日本说愿意和中共建立关系，又说愿意进行贸易。我认为这种言论对美国参议院批准和约是有严重阻碍的。”显而易见，正是在杜勒斯的要求下，日本的卖国首相吉田茂才欣然在这个为了美帝国主义的利益而出卖日本的信件上签名画押的。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府是中国人民的唯一合法的代表。我中央人民政府在缔结对日和约上的神圣权利，是绝不容许抹煞和否认的。我周恩来外长在去年九月十八日曾再次声明：中央人民政府认为美制单独对日和约是非法的，无效的，因而是绝对不能承认的。因此，吉田反动政府与国民党残匪将要缔结的任何条约，是完全非法的，无效的，它必将遭受中国人民的坚决反对。吉田政府对于它追随美国的政策和国民党残匪非法交往所产生的一切严重后果，无疑必然不能逃脱它应负的责任。
