To the People's Daily of Beijing, transferred to all the people of China:

With your tremendous encouragement and support, we finally achieved a preliminary victory on December 20, 1951, at the 18th public trial of the Sendai High Court, which ordered a retrial to investigate the facts. The 20 defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" are endlessly grateful to you. Looking back, since suffering the humiliating judgment on December 6, 1950, for a year, you sent us mountains of encouragement telegrams and letters, as well as material assistance, which dealt a major blow to the reactionaries. Now, the struggle for peace, independence, freedom, prosperity, and the demand for the acquittal of the "Matsukawa Incident" defendants has developed into a struggle of the entire Japanese people.

However, obtaining a retrial is only the first step towards victory. The content of the December 20th retrial decision also contains aspects unfavorable to the defendants. It is clear that continuing to strengthen the struggle will have a major impact on the verdict in the future. After obtaining the retrial decision, the comrades discussed it in prison and made the following decisions:

\t1. The forces of peace and democracy, demanding freedom and independence, and upholding human rights, both domestically and internationally, have begun to form a united front; the organization of a large 140-member team of lawyers domestically, the organization of three investigation teams, the publication of "Dedicated to Eighty Million Brothers" (a collection of poems about the "Matsukawa Incident"), "Truth Shines Through Iron Bars" (a collection of essays about the "Matsukawa Incident"), and other work were all carried out with the encouragement and support of the Chinese people. We twenty people can only achieve the victory of truth by relying closely on this great force of peace and democracy at home and abroad.

\t2. However, obtaining a retrial is only the first step towards victory. In the future, as domestic and foreign reactionaries become increasingly frenzied, foreign imperialism may exert pressure on the verdict as it did before the first trial.

\t3. Therefore, the retrial must rely on the strength of all the Japanese people and the people of the world to clarify right and wrong and distinguish the truth in order to crush the ambitions and conspiracies of domestic and foreign reactionaries.

\t4. Based on the above judgments, we twenty defendants are determined to fight to the death. Our central slogans are as follows:

\t\t1. Strive for a retrial with the strength of the entire nation to achieve the victory of truth!
\t\t2. Conduct a fair trial based on conscience and truth!
\t\t3. Declare us innocent and release us!
\t\t4. Only by strictly adhering to the truth can we move toward the path of peace!

On this basis, we will broadly and deeply appeal to the entire nation, urging them to rise up and carry out the anti-fascist struggle.

According to the above guidelines, we are each carrying out activities in prison, doing our best to strive for 1952 to be a year of victory for peace and truth. The opening date of the public trial next spring is scheduled for Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays every week, with two weeks of hearings followed by one week of rest. The public trial will begin on January 24th, followed by the 26th, 29th, 31st of January, 2nd, 12th, 14th, 16th, 19th, 21st, and 23rd of February, tentatively scheduled for eleven times, and further arrangements will be made later. Each hearing will begin at 10:00 AM.

Now I will report to you the recent situation of the comrades in prison:

Seventeen comrades including Suzuki Shin are all fighting strongly, although they have developed frostbite due to the severe cold and long prison life. The daily schedule is as follows: wake up at 6:30 AM, study "The Current Demands of the Japanese Communist Party - New Program," "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party," "The Chinese People's Liberation Army," "On Practice," Russian, etc. in the morning, conduct correspondence struggles in the afternoon (each person aims to write one letter and four postcards per day), and conduct research and supplementary studies after dinner. Because the lights in the prison are dim, which is harmful to the eyes, and because it is necessary to fight the severe cold, sufficient sleep is required to restore physical strength, so we go to bed at 9:00 or 10:00 PM.

Comrade Sato Ichi has been suffering from pulmonary and intestinal tuberculosis for half a year, and his request for bail has not been approved. He is now making every effort to request suspension of detention, and it may be possible for him to be released from prison for treatment in a hospital. On November 12, 1951, my rheumatic purpura suddenly worsened, and I was granted a period of suspension of detention until January 11, 1952, to be released from prison for treatment. I am currently being treated at the Tohoku University Hospital in Sendai City. It is estimated that I will still not be cured by January 11, and I am currently requesting an extension of the suspension of detention. I have been ill since April 1951, and the treatment I received in prison was nominal, so my condition gradually worsened. It was not until the eighth month of illness that I was allowed to be hospitalized for treatment. Although Comrade Sato Ichi and I are ill, our courage to fight has not diminished in the slightest. (Translator's note: Of the twenty innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," in addition to the nineteen mentioned above, the remaining one is Nikaido Sonoko, who is the only woman among the twenty and was released on bail due to illness on May 12, 1951.)

Finally, let me report to you our estimates of the public trial in the spring of 1952: From January 24th to the end of February, the main focus will be on questioning witnesses, on-site investigations in March, and subsequent trial progress will be determined item by item. Therefore, the first half of 1952 is a critical period of life and death for us twenty defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." We feel deeply the importance of the struggle during this period and vow to fight for victory with our lives. We request that you – the Chinese people – continue to give us support and guidance in the future.

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the standard-bearer of world peace and the great leader of the Asian people!

Long live the close unity between the Chinese and Japanese people!

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSaito Chi
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 23, 1951 in Japan
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTohoku University Hospital, Sendai City

### 日本“松川事件”被告斋藤千来信  报告他们决心继续进行胜利的斗争

    日本“松川事件”被告斋藤千来信
    报告他们决心继续进行胜利的斗争北京人民日报转全中国人民：
    在你们巨大的鼓励和支援下，我们终于在一九五一年十二月二十日仙台高等裁判所的第十八次公审庭上，获得了重行调查事实进行审理的初步胜利，我们“松川事件”二十名被告对你们有说不尽的感激。回想起来，自从一九五○年十二月六日遭受屈辱的判决以来，一年间，你们给我们送来了堆积如山的鼓励电文和信件以及物质的援助，给了反动派以重大的打击。现在，为争取和平、独立、自由、繁荣和要求无罪释放“松川事件”被告的斗争，已发展成为日本全国人民的斗争了。
    但是，获得重审仅仅是走向胜利的第一步。十二月二十日重审决定的内容，也包含了对被告不利的部分。很显然，今后继续加强斗争，对判决将有重大的影响。在获得重审决定后，同志们就在狱中讨论，作了如下的决定：
    一、国内外的和平民主、要求自由独立、拥护人权的力量开始结成了统一战线；国内组织一百四十名的大律师团、组织三次调查团、出版“献给八千万弟兄”（“松川事件”诗集）、“真理透过了铁窗”（“松川事件”文集）等工作，都是在中国人民的鼓励和支援下进行的。我们二十人只有紧紧地依靠着国内外的这种伟大的和平民主力量才能取得真理的胜利。
    二、然而，获得重审只是走向胜利的第一步。今后随着国内外反动派的日趋疯狂，外国帝国主义可能如第一审判决前一样，对判决施以压力。
    三、因此，重审必须依靠全体日本国民和世界人民的力量，弄清是非，辨明真相，才能粉碎国内外反动派的野心和阴谋。
    四、基于以上的判断，我们二十名被告决心誓死进行斗争。我们的中心口号如下：
    1、争取以全体国民的力量进行重审，以达到真理的胜利！
    2、基于良心和真理，进行公正的裁判！
    3、宣判我们无罪，释放我们！
    4、只有严守真理，才是走向和平的道路！
    以此为基础，广泛地深刻地向全体国民倾诉，要求他们奋起进行反法西斯的斗争。
    根据上述方针，我们在狱中各自展开活动，尽最大努力，争取一九五二年成为和平与真理获得胜利的一年。明春公审的开庭日期，预定在每周的星期二、星期四和星期六，开庭两周休息一周。公审在一月二十四日开始，其后为二十六日、二十九日、三十一日、二月二日、十二日、十四日、十六日、十九日、二十一日、二十三日等暂先预定十一次，以后另行规定。每次开庭时间从上午十时开始。
    现在我把狱中同志们的近况报告你们：
    铃木信等十七位同志都很坚强地在斗争着，虽然由于严寒和长期的狱中生活生了冻疮。每天的作息时间如下：晨六时半起床，上午学习“日本共产党的当前要求—新纲领”、“中国共产党的三十年”、“中国人民解放军”、“实践论”、俄文等，下午进行通信斗争（每人每天以写一封信、四张明信片为标准），晚饭后分别进行研究和辅助学习等。由于狱中灯光阴暗，有损目光，并且因为要和严寒斗争，必须有充分的睡眠，以恢复体力，所以晚上在九时或十时就寝。
    佐藤一同志患肺结核和肠结核病已达半年之久，要求保释没有获准，现正竭力要求停止执行拘留，也许可能获准出狱入医院疗治。我在一九五一年十一月十二日因疯湿性的紫斑症突然转剧获得了到一九五二年一月十一日为止的停止执行拘留期，出狱治病，正在仙台市东北大学附属医院治疗中。估计到一月十一日恐仍不能痊愈，现正要求延长停止执行拘留期。我从一九五一年四月起就生病，在狱中所受的是有名无实的治疗，因而病情日渐严重。到了患病的第八个月才获准入医院医治。佐藤一同志和我虽然生病，斗争的勇气是丝毫未曾减低。（译注：“松川事件”无辜被告二十人，除上面已说明的十九人外，其余一人为二阶堂园子，她是二十人中的唯一女性，已于一九五一年五月十二日因病保释出狱。）
    最后，把我们对一九五二年春公审的估计报告你们：一月二十四日起到二月底止主要是传讯证人，三月间实地调查，以后的公审进程将再逐项决定。所以，一九五二年的上半年，对我们“松川事件”二十名被告是生死关头的重大时期。我们从心中感到这个时期斗争的重要，誓以生命来争取胜利。请求你们——中国人民今后一定继续给我们以支援和指导。
    世界和平的旗手、亚洲人民伟大的领导者毛泽东同志万岁！
    中日两国人民紧密团结万岁！
                        斋藤千
                一九五一年十二月二十三日于日本
