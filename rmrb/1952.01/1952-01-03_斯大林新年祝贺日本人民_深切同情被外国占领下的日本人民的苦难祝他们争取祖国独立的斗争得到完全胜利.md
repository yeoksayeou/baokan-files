(Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch) TASS Moscow, 1st dispatch: The following is a telegram from J.V. Stalin to Mr. Iwamoto, Editor-in-Chief of Kyodo News Agency:

Mr. Iwamoto, Editor-in-Chief of Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo.

Dear Mr. Iwamoto: I have received your telegram requesting me to write a New Year's greeting to the Japanese people.

It is not customary for Soviet leaders, like foreign prime ministers, to express greetings to the people of another country. However, the Soviet people's deep sympathy for the Japanese people, who are suffering in the depths of misery due to foreign occupation, compels me to make an exception and grant your request.

Please convey to the Japanese people my wishes for their freedom and happiness. I wish them complete victory in their heroic struggle for the independence of their motherland.

In the past, the Soviet people themselves experienced the pain of foreign occupation, in which Japanese imperialists also participated. Therefore, the Soviet people fully understand the suffering of the Japanese people, deeply sympathize with them, and believe that they will be able to achieve the rebirth and independence of their motherland, just as the Soviet people did in the past.

I wish Japanese workers to be free from the suffering of unemployment and low wages, to eliminate the high prices of mass consumer goods, and I wish them victory in their struggle to safeguard peace.

I wish Japanese farmers to be free from the suffering of landlessness and land shortage, to abolish heavy taxes, and I wish them victory in their struggle to safeguard peace.

I extend my congratulations to all the Japanese people and their intellectuals, wishing complete victory to the democratic forces of Japan, the restoration and development of the country's economic life, the flourishing of national culture, science, and art, and I wish them victory in their struggle to safeguard peace.

With respect,
                                    J. Stalin
                          December 31, 1951

    斯大林新年祝贺日本人民
    深切同情被外国占领下的日本人民的苦难祝他们争取祖国独立的斗争得到完全胜利
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日电：以下是约·维·斯大林致共同通讯社总编辑岩本先生的电报：
    东京共同通讯社总编辑岩本先生。
    亲爱的岩本先生：你要求我给日本人民写新年贺词的来电已收到了。
    苏联领袖们没有外国总理那种向另一国人民表示祝贺的惯例。但是苏联人民对于因被外国占领而处于水深火热之中的日本人民的深切同情促使我破例答应你的要求。
    请转告日本人民，我祝他们自由幸福，我祝他们为争取他们的祖国的独立而进行的英勇斗争获得完全胜利。
    以往苏联人民自己曾经历过被外国占领的痛苦，这种占领是日本帝国主义者也曾参加过的。因此苏联人民完全理解日本人民的苦难，深切同情他们，相信他们一定能够像苏联人民过去曾经做到的那样求得他们的祖国的新生和独立。
    我祝日本工人能够免除失业和工资低微的痛苦，消除大众消费品价格高昂的现象，并祝他们维护和平的斗争得到胜利。
    我祝日本农民能够免除无地和少地的痛苦，取消重税，并祝他们维护和平的斗争得到胜利。
    我向全体日本人民和他们的知识分子祝贺，愿日本的民主力量完全胜利，这个国家的经济生活得以恢复和发展，民族文化、科学和艺术得以发扬光大，并祝他们维护和平的斗争得到胜利。
    敬  礼
                                    约·斯大林
                          一九五一年十二月三十一日
