    Youth League member Chen Tingsong is an outstanding staff member of the Nanjing Branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Equipment Company. In performing his duties, he resolutely fought against the bureaucracy of leading cadres in order to safeguard state property and achieved victory.

    The leading cadres of the Nanjing Branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Equipment Company have serious bureaucracy in the management of the enterprise, which has caused huge losses to state property. According to preliminary statistics, from January 1951 to the present, the losses already discovered due to theft by illegal merchants and internal corruption and waste in the company amount to more than 389 million yuan. The phenomenon of capital backlog is even more serious. The brick and tile purchasing department suffered from illegal merchants embezzling payments and delaying deliveries. In the three months from August to October alone, more than 1 billion yuan of funds were frozen, and some have already been written off as losses. For example, ordering 200,000 red bricks from the so-called "Jinchuan Brick and Tile Factory," which had no factory base at all, resulted in the company being defrauded of an advance payment of more than 23 million yuan, which has not yet been recovered. Some private merchants cut corners and used bad bricks in place of good bricks, seriously endangering the state's basic construction projects and causing dissatisfaction with the company from all sides.

    Chen Tingsong, while working as a clerk, had repeatedly reported these situations to the manager, but the leadership did not take it seriously.

    In September 1951, Chen Tingsong was transferred to work as an external inspector for the brick and tile group of the business section, and he became more active in fighting to protect state property. He closely contacted and relied on the workers and masses, and learned from the trade unions and workers of various brick and tile factories that a quarter of the more than 60 brick and tile manufacturers accepting orders from the company were engaged in stealing state property. For example, the manager of the Daye Brick and Tile Factory privately sold a portion of the bricks stored in the factory by the company and embezzled 54 million yuan of the payment. Junji Brick and Tile Factory, which had always been considered "reliable" by the company, was found after 14 consecutive in-depth inspections to have been defrauding the state of 54 million yuan in payments through speculative activities, failing to deliver bricks on time. However, Li Xing, the head of the business section, as well as the deputy manager Lu Daoping, and the manager Liu Zimin, adopted an intolerable bureaucratic attitude towards Chen Tingsong's reports. Section Chief Li Xing initially said his report was "not specific," and later asked him to write a "detailed written material." After Chen Tingsong wrote and submitted the material several times, he used the excuse of being "busy" and said he "did not have time to deal with it," locking the material in his drawer without replying. As the problem became more and more serious, Chen Tingsong reported to the deputy manager and manager. However, these leading cadres were so paralyzed that they believed that brick and tile merchants had been accepting state orders for a long time and "probably would not ruin their reputation themselves," and they also ignored Chen Tingsong. As a result, the company's assets continued to suffer losses.

    The illegal merchants exposed by Chen Tingsong for defrauding state assets had tried to lure and soften him with dinners and other means, but Chen Tingsong sternly rejected them. The illegal merchants then attacked Chen Tingsong in front of the company's section chief and deputy manager, saying that he "had prejudices" and was "destroying public-private relations," and demanded that another "good" cadre be sent to replace Chen's work. These leading cadres did not analyze the problem and actually believed the words of the illegal merchants. They instead suspected Chen Tingsong and suppressed his opinions even more without dealing with them. At the same time, a small number of cadres in the business section with bad ideological styles, such as Zou Fuchu, who was in charge of purchasing bricks and tiles, also formed a small faction and took the opportunity to pour cold water on him, saying that he was "making a fuss." Chen Tingsong was in pain in his heart under the circumstances of being attacked. He thought: Should he fight resolutely? Or should he retreat and wait? He thought that he was a youth nurtured by the Party, and he could not have personal plans, and he must never be captured by bourgeois ideology and bureaucracy. At this time, the Party branch also supported him. He united several external affairs comrades and continued to resolutely fight against bureaucratic elements. In mid-October, Zou Fuchu, who was in charge of purchasing bricks and tiles, paid cash to three brick and tile factories engaged in speculative activities. Chen Tingsong and others launched a direct struggle with Zou Fuchu. Chen Tingsong warned him: "If you do not listen to my advice and pay for the goods without investigation, you must take full responsibility for the loss in the future. I will report you to the People's Government!" As a result, the company canceled the purchase from these three speculative manufacturers, saving the state more than 50 million yuan. However, the leadership still refused to make a decision, and the serious situation was not fundamentally changed. Therefore, Chen Tingsong reported to the Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau and reported to the Municipal People's Procuratorate. This aroused the attention of all parties. The Municipal People's Procuratorate and the Industry and Commerce Bureau have recently sent inspection teams to the company for inspection. After the initial investigation from the bottom up and from the outside to the inside, it has been proved that the facts reported by Chen Tingsong are true. The company is now further launching a campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The company has also recovered payments from illegal merchants who have been found to have defrauded state property.

    Chen Tingsong is the son of a tenant farmer in the suburbs of Xuzhou. He enlisted in the army at the age of 20 (1949) to participate in the work of supporting the front line of the Liberation War. After entering Nanjing with the troops, he was transferred to do local work. He maintained the People's Liberation Army's fine traditions of hard work, simplicity, and fearlessness of difficulties. His spirit of resolutely fighting to protect state property, fighting against illegal merchants, dishonest staff, and the bureaucracy of leading cadres has been publicly praised by the leading organs of Nanjing City and was elected by the Youth League branch of the Nanjing Branch of China Coal Industry Construction Equipment Company as a representative to attend the Municipal Youth League Congress. He made a typical report at the meeting.

    坚决与官僚主义作斗争的陈庭松
    新华社记者  魏文华
    青年团员陈庭松，是中国煤业建筑器材公司南京分公司的一个优秀工作人员。他在执行任务中，为了维护国家财产，坚决地和领导干部的官僚主义进行斗争，取得了胜利。
    中国煤业建筑器材公司南京分公司领导干部对企业的经营管理存在严重的官僚主义，曾使国家财产遭受巨大损失。据初步统计：一九五一年一月到现在，已经发现的被不法商人盗窃以及公司内部的贪污浪费损失即有三亿八千九百多万元。资金积压现象更加严重，砖瓦收购部门因不法商人套用货款延不交货，仅八月到十月这三个月中就有十亿元以上的资金被冻结，有些已经报损。如向根本没有厂基的所谓“金川砖瓦厂”订购二十万块红阴砖，被不法商人骗去订款二千三百多万元，至今还未追回。部分私商偷工减料、用坏砖顶好砖，严重地危害了国家的基本建设事业，引起各方面对公司的不满。
    这些情况，陈庭松在做内勤工作时，就曾不断地向经理反映过，但领导方面并未引起警惕。
    一九五一年九月，陈庭松调做业务科砖瓦小组外勤检查员，他就更积极地为维护国家财产而斗争。他密切联系和依靠工人群众，先后从各砖瓦厂的工会、工人群众中了解到接受公司订货的六十多家砖瓦厂竟有四分之一的厂商有盗窃国家资财的行为。如大业砖瓦厂经理私自把公司存在该厂的一部分砖卖掉，套用货款五千四百万元。一向被公司认为“可靠”的钧记砖瓦厂，经他连续深入检查十四次，终于查明该厂经理利用买空卖空手段，骗得国家五千四百万元的货款，在市场上进行投机活动，到期欠砖不交。但公司的业务科长厉行以及副经理陆道平、经理刘子敏等，对陈庭松的汇报采取了不可容忍的官僚主义的态度。科长厉行起初说他的汇报“不具体”，后来又要他写“详细书面材料”。陈庭松连写几次材料送去后，他又藉口“事情忙”，说“没有工夫处理”，将材料锁在抽屉里，不作答复。问题越来越严重，陈庭松又向副经理、经理汇报。但是这些领导干部竟麻痹到这样的程度，认为砖瓦商长久接受国家订货，“大概不会自败名誉”，也对陈庭松不加理会。因此，公司资财继续遭受着损失。
    被陈庭松揭穿欺诈国家资财行为的不法商人，曾经用请客等方式来利诱软化他，都被陈庭松严词拒绝。不法商人于是就到公司的科长、副经理面前攻击陈庭松，说他“有偏见”，“破坏公私关系”，要求另派“好”干部来代替陈的工作。这些领导干部对问题不加分析，居然相信不法商人的话，反而怀疑陈庭松，更加把他的意见压下来不处理。同时业务科内少数思想作风恶劣的干部，如负责收购砖瓦的邹复初等，也结成小宗派，乘机会向他泼冷水，说他“瞎吓唬”。陈庭松在遭受打击的情况下，内心是痛苦的。他想：应该坚决的斗争呢？还是退让等待？他想到自己是党教养大的青年，不能有个人打算，决不能作资产阶级思想和官僚主义的俘虏。这时，党的支部也支持他。他团结了几个外勤同志，继续坚决地向官僚主义分子斗争。十月中，负责收购砖瓦的邹复初又向三家卖空投机的砖瓦厂付现款订货，陈庭松等便和邹复初展开正面斗争。陈庭松警告他：“你如不听忠告，不经调查付出货款，将来损失了，你一定要负全责。我要向人民政府告发你！”结果，公司取消了对这三家卖空投机厂商的收购，使国家避免了五千多万元的损失。但领导方面还不肯下决心，严重情况并未根本改变。因此，陈庭松就向市人民政府工商局作了报告，并向市人民检察署检举。这样引起了各方的重视。市人民检察署、工商局最近都派出了检查组到该公司检查，经过由下而上及由外界到内部的初步调查结果，证明陈庭松检举的事实都是确实的。现在该公司已进一步展开反贪污、反浪费和反官僚主义的运动。公司方面并已向已经查明骗取国家财产的不法商人追回货款。
    陈庭松是徐州郊区一个佃农的儿子，二十岁（一九四九年）入伍参加解放战争的支援前线工作，随部队进入南京后调做地方工作。他保持了人民解放军艰苦朴素、不怕困难的优良传统。他这种坚决为保护国家财产，向不法商人、行为不正的工作人员及领导干部的官僚主义作风进行斗争的精神，受到了南京市领导机关公开的表扬，并被中国煤业建筑器材公司南京分公司青年团支部推选为出席全市青年团代表大会的代表。他曾在会上作了典型报告。
