    The CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau General Office Holds Meeting
    Inspects the Anti-Corruption Movement in Northeast-Level Organs

    The General Office of the CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau convened a meeting on January 14, calling on responsible comrades of Northeast first-level organs party committees to report on the dynamics of each unit after Comrade Gao Gang's report on continuing to deepen the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucratism campaign.

    Since Comrade Gao Gang's report, all units have conveyed it, which has had a significant impact on the thinking of cadres. At present, most units have begun to take action. However, the following problems still exist: some leading cadres still do not have a deep understanding of this movement and have the mentality of "getting through." Some units are eager to organize cadres to go down to inspect before the leading cadres have made thorough self-criticisms.

    In light of the above situation, the meeting pointed out that all personnel in all units should, without exception, thoroughly expose corruption, waste, and bureaucratism, and thoroughly eliminate the influence of the bourgeoisie. It is imperative to take action within the prescribed time limit, and those who fail to act after the deadline must be strictly dealt with. Leading comrades of each unit must first seriously examine themselves. Those who have carried out the campaign more thoroughly in the past can send people down to inspect; those who have not carried it out thoroughly in the past should temporarily not go down, but concentrate their efforts on examining themselves; those who have not moved at all must wait until they have carried out the campaign thoroughly before sending people down.

    Nanjing City Report Team Goes Deep into Rural Suburbs
    Mobilizing the Broad Masses of Peasants to Participate in the Anti-Corruption Struggle

    In order to promote the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucratism to the broad masses of peasants in the suburbs, 54 city- and district-level report team members of Nanjing City went to 55 townships in the suburbs on the 16th and 17th to deliver mobilization reports to more than 24,000 peasants.

    Before going to the countryside, the report team members generally learned in detail about the peasants' ideological and work situation in this movement. For example, Comrade Li Leping, a city-level report team member, went to Shangxinhe Township the day before the report to learn in detail from three inspection work teams about the specific situation of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucratism movement in the township. Therefore, his report was very relevant to the local reality and greatly encouraged the masses.

    Before the report team members went to the countryside to report, the peasants' understanding of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucratism movement was insufficient. Some village and township cadres suppressed democracy and attacked activists who made suggestions, so the masses had ideological concerns. In addition, some bad elements took the opportunity to provoke relations between cadres and the masses, distorting the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucratism movement into "struggling against cadres," so some cadres who had made mistakes did not dare to be frank and introspective. After listening to the reports of the report team members, these cadres have begun to realize that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucratism movement is not "struggling against cadres," but is calling on cadres who have made mistakes to be frank and self-renew, correct their shortcomings, and eliminate those behaviors that endanger the interests of the country and the people, so as to better serve the people. Some village and township cadres who had engaged in corruption immediately took the lead in confessing and making self-criticisms at the meeting. As for those cadres who had been unwilling to admit their mistakes and were not serious about being frank, they were exposed by the masses on the spot and were punished.

    After the report team members reported, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucratism movement in various townships was launched vigorously. The next day, Muxuyuan Township in Lingyuan District held an anti-corruption confession and accusation meeting, at which ten corrupt elements were exposed. The masses of Dongfengshang Village in Qigan Township also held a meeting to make suggestions to the village cadres. After listening to the reports, peasants in some villages organized discussions or chats to further understand the significance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucratism movement for increasing production and practicing economy, and felt even more hatred for corrupt elements.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    中共中央东北局办公厅召开会议
    检查东北级机关反贪污运动情况
    中共中央东北局办公厅在一月十四日召集东北一级机关党委负责同志汇报在高岗同志关于继续深入反贪污反浪费反官僚主义报告后各单位的动态。
    自高岗同志报告后，各单位均进行了传达，在干部思想上起了很大作用，目前大多数单位均已开始行动。但是，还存在以下几个问题：有的领导干部对这次运动认识仍不深刻，存在着“过关”思想。有些单位在领导干部还未作彻底的检讨之前，即急于组织干部下去检查。
    根据上述情况，会议指出：所有单位一切人员应毫无例外地深入揭发贪污浪费官僚主义，要彻底肃清资产阶级的影响。务必按照限期行动起来，逾期未动者必须加以严格处理。各单位领导同志必须首先认真检讨自己。过去进行较彻底的，可以派人下去检查；过去进行不彻底的，暂时先不下去，集中力量检查本身；根本未动的则须待进行彻底后再派人下去。
    南京市报告员深入郊区农村
    动员广大农民参加反贪污斗争
    南京市为了把增产节约，反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动推进到郊区广大农民群众中去，南京市五十四位市、区级报告员在十六、十七两日分赴郊区五十五个乡镇向二万四千余农民作了动员报告。
    报告员在下乡前，一般都先详细地了解了农民群众在这一运动中的思想情况和工作情况。如市级报告员李乐平同志，在报告前一天，曾先赴上新河镇向三个检查工作组详细了解了该镇开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的具体情况，因此，他的报告很切合当地实际，对群众鼓舞很大。
    在报告员未下乡报告前，农民们对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的认识是不足的，部分乡村干部压制民主，打击提意见的积极分子，因此群众都有思想顾虑。加上一些坏分子又乘机挑拨干部和群众的关系，把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动歪曲为：“斗干部”，因此一些犯过错误的干部都不敢坦白反省。听了报告员的报告后，这些干部已开始认识到反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动不是“斗干部”，而是叫有错误的干部坦白自新，改正缺点，把那些危害国家人民利益的行为铲除干净，更好地为人民服务。一些有贪污行为的村、乡干部立刻在会上带头坦白，作了检讨。至于那些一直不肯承认错误、不认真坦白的干部当场就被群众检举出来，并受到了制裁。
    报告员报告之后，各个乡的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动便轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。陵园区苜蓿园乡第二天就开了反贪污坦白检举大会，会上检举出十个贪污分子。棋杆乡东凤上村的群众也开会向村干部提了意见。有的村的农民听了报告后，并组织了讨论或漫谈，进一步认识了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动对增产节约的意义，对贪污分子更感到痛恨。
