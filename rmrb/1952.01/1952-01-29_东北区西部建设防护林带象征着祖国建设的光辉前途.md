    The Protective Forest Belt Construction in Western Northeast China Symbolizes the Brilliant Future of the Motherland's Construction
    Editor: I was very excited to see the news in the newspaper about the construction of the great protective forest belt in western Northeast China.
    I had heard that the Soviet Union was building many large-scale hydropower stations and digging many large canals. I also heard that Stalin's plan to transform nature included the construction of huge protective forests. At that time, I felt that communist construction was truly great.
    During my summer internship, we saw that many hills and plains along the Jinpu and Longhai Railways lacked trees. After arriving in Beijing, I saw yellow sand everywhere when the wind blew, and I deeply felt that it was necessary for our country to learn from the Soviet Union in transforming nature and building protective forests.
    Now I am extremely happy to see the plan for the construction of a protective forest belt in western Northeast China published in the newspaper. When this plan is completed as scheduled, it will not only reduce natural disasters, guarantee good harvests, and expand cultivated land, but also provide a large amount of timber needed for the motherland's construction. This plan symbolizes the brilliant future of our great motherland's economic construction and demonstrates the superiority of the new democratic social system. I wish this great construction project a successful completion.

    东北区西部建设防护林带象征着祖国建设的光辉前途
    编辑同志：我在报纸上看到东北区西部建设伟大的防护林带的消息，感到非常兴奋。
    我曾经听说苏联正在建筑许多大规模的水电站，开挖许多大运河，也听说斯大林改造自然计划中，计划建造巨大的防护林，当时觉得共产主义的建设真是伟大。
    暑假实习时，我们看见津浦、陇海铁路沿线的许多山丘和平原都缺少树木。到北京后，又看到大风一起，遍地都是黄沙，我深感我国有学习苏联改造大自然，建造防护林的必要。
    现在我看到报纸上登载的在东北区西部建设防护林带的计划，真有说不出的高兴。这个计划如期完成后，不只可以减免自然灾害，保证丰收，扩大耕地面积，同时还能大量供应祖国建筑事业需用的木材。这个计划象征着我们伟大祖国经济建设的光辉前途，表现了新民主主义社会制度的优越性。我预祝这一伟大的建设工程胜利完成。
