    The Ministry of Railways Should Correct the Bureaucratic Work Style of the Director of the Materials Bureau
    Editor: The Director of the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has a bureaucratic work style. Three factories directly under the Ministry of Railways were forced to stop work due to lack of materials. They telegraphed and telephoned their superiors to request a solution to this problem, but to no avail. They had no choice but to send people directly to the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways to negotiate. Wu Ruzhong, a cadre at the Tianjin Supply Office of the Materials Bureau, told the people who came: "If you ask the Ministry of Railways to stop the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, I will allocate materials to you." The people who came had no choice but to report this situation to the Factory Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which in turn reported it to the Director of the Materials Bureau. The Director of the Materials Bureau paid no attention to this matter and instead said: "Materials can be allocated according to the plan; without a plan, it's impossible!" In fact, this is not a question of whether there is a plan or not, but a question of having a plan that is not being implemented and a failure to understand the situation. The responsible cadres of the Ministry of Railways should pay attention to correcting the bureaucratic work style of the Director of the Materials Bureau and Wu Ruzhong's erroneous views on this great movement.

    铁道部应纠正材料局局长的官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：中央人民政府铁道部材料局局长有官僚主义作风。铁道部直属的三个工厂，因停工待料，曾经打电报、电话给上级，请求解决这个问题，都没有结果，只好派人直接到铁道部材料局交涉。材料局驻天津供应处干部吴汝钟对来人说：“你要叫铁道部停止反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，我就给你们拨料。”来人没有办法，便把这个情况告诉铁道部厂务局，再由厂务局反映给材料局局长。材料局局长对这件事毫不注意，反说：“照计划办事可以拨料，没有计划不行！”其实，这不是有没有计划的问题，而是有了计划没有办和不了解情况的问题。铁道部负责干部应注意纠正材料局局长的官僚主义作风以及吴汝钟对这次伟大运动的错误看法。    读者
