    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 1st: Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, sent a New Year's telegram on New Year's Day 1952 to all commanders and combatants of the land, sea, and air forces of the Korean People's Army, wishing them a Happy New Year. The telegram stated:
    In the past year, our Korean People's Army, together with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, has achieved historic victories and accomplishments in the struggle against the armed aggression of the United States and Britain.
    The telegram said: In the sacred struggle for the freedom and happiness of the motherland and the people, the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army have displayed outstanding heroism and patriotism, demonstrating the honor of the Korean People's Army to the world with their high combat achievements. In the course of the war, the Korean People's Army has learned how to correctly estimate the enemy's strength and strike the enemy at any time, and has grown into an invincible revolutionary armed force with rich combat experience, skilled military technology, combat skills, and high moral qualities. We are fully prepared to completely destroy and expel the armed interventionists of the United States and Britain from our country's territory in the future. Any struggle by the aggressors cannot withstand our growing combat power. Moreover, the support given by the people of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the various people's democratic countries to the Korean people, who have risen up to carry out a just struggle against the aggression of US imperialism for the independence and freedom of their motherland, further strengthens our confidence in final victory.
    The telegram also said: Under the current circumstances, if the US imperialist aggressors do not abandon their vicious ambitions towards Korea and continue to wage a war of aggression, then all that awaits them is a shameful defeat. But the enemy is cunning and vicious. In order to more effectively strike and eliminate the aggressors, and to completely smash any struggle by the enemy, we should not be intoxicated with victory, but should further increase our revolutionary vigilance.
    The telegram concluded: I believe that all officers and soldiers of our People's Army will create new models of heroism, bravery, and tenacity in 1952 to strive for greater victories and achievements, so as to promote the arrival of the final victory expected by the motherland and the people. Long live our glorious Korean People's Army! Glory to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers!

    金日成将军致电朝鲜人民军贺年
    号召提高革命的警惕性争取更大胜利
    朝鲜人民纷向前方朝中人民军队献礼
    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军在一九五二年元旦致电朝鲜人民军陆、海、空军全体指挥员、战斗员祝贺新年。电文中说：
    在过去的一年，我们朝鲜人民军和兄弟的中国人民志愿军一起，在反抗美、英武装侵略者的斗争中取得了历史性的胜利和成就。
    电文说：朝鲜人民军官兵在争取祖国与人民的自由幸福的神圣斗争中，发挥了卓越的英雄主义和爱国主义精神，以自己高度的战斗功勋向全世界显示了朝鲜人民军的荣誉。在战争过程中，朝鲜人民军学会了在任何时候正确估计敌人的力量而打击敌人的方法，壮大成具有丰富战斗经验和熟练的军事技术、战斗技能和高度的道德品质的必胜不败的革命的武装力量。我们已经做好了今后在我国疆土上完全击灭和驱逐美、英武装干涉者的一切准备。侵略者的任何挣扎也抵挡不了我们日益强大的战斗力量。而且伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国及各人民民主国家人民所给予为祖国的独立、自由而奋起进行着反抗美帝国主义侵略者的正义斗争的朝鲜人民的支援，更加坚定着我们的最后胜利的信心。
    电文又说：在目前的情况下，如果美帝国主义侵略者不放弃其对朝鲜的凶恶野心而继续进行侵略战争的话，那么等待他们的只能是可耻的失败。但是敌人是狡猾而凶恶的。我们为了更有力地打击和消灭侵略者，为了彻底粉碎敌人的任何挣扎，就不应该为胜利所陶醉，而应更加提高革命的警惕性。
    电文最后说：我相信我们人民军的全体官兵将在一九五二年中，创造英雄主义勇敢顽强的新的模范来争取更大的胜利和成就，以促进祖国与人民所期待的最后胜利的到来。我们的光荣的朝鲜人民军万岁！光荣属于英勇的中国人民志愿军！
    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜各界人民在新年到来之际热烈展开了支援前线的运动，纷纷给前方的朝中人民军队献送大批的新年礼物。平壤市的工人和职员，从十二月一日起就以完成生产计划两倍到三倍的额外收入支援了前方。已超额完成一九五一年生产计划的某工厂的工人劳动党党员金顺德，把长期节省下来的钱买了毛袜和毛巾，送给前线的勇士们。平壤市民主妇女同盟也赠送了大批棉袜和手套。市内各界人民并对革命烈士家属、军人家属和战区灾民进行了亲切的慰问。平安南道平原郡的人民也给朝中人民军队献送了大批的礼品。该郡肃川面新兴里的妇女，献出了数十床被子和一批袜子与手套。
    临近火线地区的人民，热烈参加了修复公路和运送军粮的工作，同时把许多礼品赠给前方战士。江原道某里妇女送给前方战士九百双棉袜和三百多条毛巾。淮阳郡人民送给前方战士四千多件礼品和五千多斤肉类。六十九岁的老人朴根锡把自己养的一口肥猪也献出来。妇女金春姬还在自己送给战士们的礼品上绣了“胜利属于火线上的兄弟”和“祝兄弟们新年快乐”等字样。
