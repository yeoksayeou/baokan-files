A major case of collective embezzlement and bribery occurred in the business section of the Jinan Industrial Bureau of the East China Industrial Department. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Jinan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC has made a decision on the relevant party member cadres and reported it to the superior party committee for approval, giving them party disciplinary action. The following is a summary of this decision:

The case of cadres and staff of the business section of the Jinan Industrial Bureau of the East China Industrial Department collectively embezzling and taking bribes, stealing and selling materials, undermining policies, and violating laws and regulations is extremely serious and complex. Since this incident was discovered in January 1951, the Jinan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC sent people to investigate and instructed the Industrial Bureau Party Committee to thoroughly handle it. The Discipline Inspection Department of the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee also sent people to assist the Jinan Municipal Party Committee in conducting in-depth investigations. It was not until the beginning of July last year that the true situation of this case was finally clarified. Six party member cadres, six non-party staff members, and one non-party staff member from the secretariat participated in this embezzlement case. This group of embezzlers, led by Lu Yuan, head of the business section, and Fan Gang, deputy head of the section (both party members), also included Xu Shanzhi, Song Deliang, and Xu Fushun, the directors and deputy directors of the business office (all party members), Liu Dianhai (party member), Liu Dianfang, and Yan Su, the heads of the business group, as well as Chen Shusen and Quan Rongtang, the purchasing agents, Liu Xiaoci, the accountant (a counter-revolutionary element, who has been arrested by the public security organs), Yang Zhongyu, the statistics investigator, and Zang Jieting and others the clerks. Therefore, this embezzlement case is an organized collective embezzlement behavior, with the business office as the core of fraudulent and illegal activities. This case is also closely related to the case of Liu Zijie (Liu Xiaoci's younger brother), Zhang Qingji and other counter-revolutionary elements (all of whom have been arrested by the public security organs) from the Industrial Bureau's three factories stealing and selling inventory materials.

According to the investigation, their means of embezzlement were: violating business policies, accepting large amounts of bribes from private merchants, extorting merchants, shamelessly begging merchants for assistance to "solve family difficulties," colluding with unscrupulous merchants to create false bills of lading, depositing public funds in banks to generate interest for themselves, smuggling and evading taxes, embezzling tax money, stealing and selling state materials, and so on. These embezzlers were corrupt and degenerate in their lives. It had become a common practice to eat, drink, and watch operas with merchants, and even frequently gamble and patronize prostitutes with them. Fan Gang married the sister of the counter-revolutionary element Liu Xiaoci and became his confidant. During the reorganization in 1949, the party organization sent party member cadres to work in the business section, but they refused to accept them. After the case was discovered, Xu Shanzhi repeatedly conspired with counter-revolutionary elements to devise countermeasures. Due to embezzlement and corruption, without repentance, he eventually degenerated and embarked on the path of counter-revolution.

The main facts of embezzlement, bribery, violation of laws and regulations committed by Lu Yuan and others are as follows:

I. It has now been ascertained that embezzlement from only two items, bribery and depositing public funds for interest, amounted to more than RMB 20.5 million, over 7 million North Sea currency, and 100 "actual unit" shares, twelve 17-jewel swimming watches, seven fountain pens, and other daily necessities such as slide rules, steel rulers, pliers, radios, shoes, hats, clothing, rice, flour, and coal were countless. The most serious case was Xu Shanzhi colluding with counter-revolutionary elements hidden in Factory No. 3 to steal and sell inventory materials, including sixteen jars of sulfuric acid, sixteen kilograms of silk strings, several buckets of paint, six thick and thin rulers, and dozens of boxes of small screws, which were sold for a total of 30.02 million North Sea currency (equivalent to 11,000 kilograms of millet at the then market price), and shared the spoils together. In addition, each person's accounts were unclear, with shortages and surpluses ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions, which was difficult to ascertain for the time being.

II. Colluding with private merchants and betraying national interests caused enormous losses to state property, which is impossible to calculate. For example, buying materials from private merchants at high prices, the highest being 137% higher than the market price. According to very incomplete statistics from 1950 alone, there were thirty-three instances of purchasing materials from private merchants at higher prices than the market price, costing a total of more than RMB 286.24 million. The business section also bought inferior goods and sold them to its own factories at high prices. For example, pig iron, the market price was RMB 1,800 per kilogram, and the business section sold it to the factory at RMB 2,400. Because the goods were of poor quality and could not be used, the waste was even greater. Song Deliang, because of accepting bribes from Cao Yongshou, a merchant from Shanghai, bought 384 pieces of low-quality eight-foot, ten-foot, and twelve-foot adjustable wrenches at a high price of RMB 33.6 million (which was only worth RMB 28.32 million at the then market price), which are still stockpiled in the warehouse and cannot be processed. At the same time, they boldly sheltered private merchants, considered the interests of private merchants, and arbitrarily revised contracts, allowing advance payments to be borrowed by private merchants for a long time, which affected production.

III. The purchasing personnel of the business section colluded with private merchants, seriously smuggled and evaded taxes, or indulged unscrupulous merchants in not paying taxes because of bribery, and even colluded with them to directly embezzle tax money. According to extremely incomplete statistics from 1950 alone, there were more than 120 cases of tax evasion. It has been ascertained that transaction orders, allocation orders, and contracts had a total of 5,617,500 yuan in stamp duty evaded and capital accounts evaded 195,166,600 yuan in stamp duty. Lu Yuan bought 795 kilograms of iron ore in Qingdao, and the goods tax alone was 340,731 yuan, but not a penny was paid. When Song Deliang bought waste newspaper in Tianjin, he embezzled all 234,412 yuan of tax money given to him by the merchant and sheltered Wu Taifeng, a merchant selling waste newspaper, from evading 493,695 yuan in merchant tax. The total tax evaded by the business section was RMB 201,850,433. With their connivance, it is even more difficult to calculate the tax evaded by private merchants.

IV. In order to reduce transportation costs and report lower tax rates, they disregarded the safety of people's lives and frequently disguised the highly flammable "ammonium nitrate" raw material as fertilizer for transportation, totaling 600 tons, reducing transportation costs by RMB 227,994,400. They transported 50 kilograms of the first-class explosive raw material "hexogen" mixed with black lead powder and disguised flammable black oil paper as ordinary paper for transportation. This not only violated the regulations of the People's Railway but was also extremely dangerous. This spring, the "ammonium nitrate" transported by the business section caught fire at Jinan Station. However, the business section and the leading cadres of the Industrial Bureau have not paid attention to it.

The above-mentioned embezzlement and criminal acts have caused irreparable losses to the party and the state. These facts also prove the chaos in the industrial bureau's business operations. Taking the large amount of transactions with private merchants without unified procurement by local trade agencies alone is an illegal act. At the same time, these personnel have lost the due qualities of state-owned enterprise personnel. What they have done has degenerated into the behavior of speculative and unscrupulous merchants, seriously undermining the political prestige of state-owned enterprises. This embezzlement group was actually led by party member cadres. These party members could not withstand the test in the environment after entering the city and completely degenerated. Xu Shanzhi even degenerated to the counter-revolutionary stance. The leadership of the Industrial Bureau has long indulged them, allowing their criminal behavior to develop to an irreparable point. They should also be responsible for this incident.

Cui Zhusan actively fought against embezzlement

The embezzlement case of the business section of the Industrial Bureau was discovered by Comrade Cui Zhusan (party member), the second deputy head of the business section. He played an active role in this anti-corruption struggle from beginning to end. However, he was not only subjected to the organized attacks and slanders of the embezzlers but also suffered from the attacks and suppression of the Industrial Bureau's leadership. When Comrade Cui Zhusan initially exposed Yang Zhongyu's embezzlement, and then involved Xu Shanzhi, Zang Jieting, and other three people in collective embezzlement, Fan Gang held the party branch of the organ and tried every means to obstruct it, saying that Comrade Cui Zhusan's "doing this causes unnecessary panic"; and reported to the higher authorities: "Cui Zhusan is retaliating against Yang Zhongyu. Cui Zhusan also has embezzling actions." After Fan Gang went to Shanghai, he also wrote a letter to the Industrial Bureau Party Committee, proposing: "If Cui Zhusan is not dealt with, we will accuse the East China Bureau." With the support of Miao Fengyu, the secretary of the general branch of the organ's party branch, and Ji Xueming, the organizational cadre of the Industrial Bureau Party Committee, they also tried their best to suppress the investigation of Xu Shanzhi.

The leadership of the Industrial Bureau reversed right and wrong in this incident, repeatedly refusing to adopt Comrade Cui Zhusan's suggestions, but instead said: "Your section has embezzlement, you are also responsible!" ordering Comrade Cui Zhusan to reflect. Comrade Cui Zhusan was forced to directly accuse the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee and the Jinan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC. After Yang Zhongyu was sent to the court, the Industrial Bureau Party Committee still did not strictly investigate Xu Shanzhi. Even after Zang Jieping confessed that he had fabricated budgets and embezzled funds with Xu Shanzhi's approval when repairing the retail department, and that the three had eaten and drunk together more than fifty times, Dong Zhongchi, the deputy secretary of the Industrial Bureau Party Committee, still arbitrarily said at the meeting, "Xu Shanzhi is an accomplice, he did not share the spoils," trying his best to protect Xu Shanzhi.

After the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee and the Jinan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC instructed the Industrial Bureau Party Committee to thoroughly investigate the embezzlement case, the leadership of the Industrial Bureau still emphasized that the business section was having "cadre relationship" problems and emphasized that Comrade Cui Zhusan's "style was not upright" and that he "also had embezzling actions." Wang Xinmin, the secretary of the Industrial Bureau Party Committee, reported to the Jinan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC: "Cui Zhusan is simply not like a communist party member. If he is not dealt with, the cadres of the business section will resign!" and arranged a meeting to "struggle" against Cui Zhusan (which was stopped by the Municipal Party Committee). He also sent people to check Cui Zhusan's accounts and collected various details of Cui Zhusan's life and historical materials; he also notified Cui Zhusan three times to go to Shanghai for training. Dong Zhongchi, the deputy secretary of the Industrial Bureau Party Committee, could not figure it out for a long time and repeatedly wrote letters to the Jinan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC, complaining and dissatisfied, saying that the Municipal Party Committee "listened to one-sided words" and showed a resistant attitude towards the Municipal Party Committee's instructions.

After the Jinan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC criticized and corrected them and analyzed and criticized them at several meetings, the leadership of the Industrial Bureau also changed somewhat and investigated the embezzlers. However, after the entire situation was exposed, the Industrial Bureau Party Committee still emphasized that Cui Zhusan must be dealt with afterward. In its first handling report, the Industrial Bureau Party Committee still did not summarize the lessons learned from the huge losses of state property caused by embezzlement, but simply listed the amount of bribes received by each person. Until the end, after the Discipline Inspection Department of the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee helped the Jinan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC to conduct a new in-depth investigation, more serious materials were discovered, and it was verified that Cui Zhusan had no embezzling actions, the responsible persons of the Industrial Bureau Party Committee admitted that they did have mistakes on this issue; however, their understanding of their own mistakes was still insufficient.

The leading cadres of the Industrial Bureau Party Committee "used people based on kinship" in their cadre policy. They relied on the relationships of "old superiors" and "old subordinates" for everything, trusting their favorite cadres without principle, failing to distinguish between right and wrong, lacking the party's principled stance, and lacking a serious and correct attitude towards problems. The work style of the Party Committee was undemocratic, the Party Committee system was not implemented, ideological struggle could not be carried out, and the collective leadership role of the Party Committee could not be brought into play, forming a patriarchal style of individual decision-making. Anyone who had different opinions from the leadership was suppressed, and even suffered attacks and retaliation. This style of leadership fostered the arrogance of those who made mistakes in refusing to accept criticism and delayed the handling of this case.

Embezzling party members were disciplined by the party

In order to strictly enforce party discipline, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Jinan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC decided to give party disciplinary action to the relevant party member cadres in the embezzlement case and has reported it to the superior party committee for approval.

I. Lu Yuan—from Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, 36 years old. His family background was that of a poor peasant, and his personal background was that of a handicraft worker. He started working in 1940 and joined the party for the first time in 1941. He was expelled from the party for embezzlement and corruption. He rejoined the party in 1943. He has served as administrator, section chief, and director of the business section of the Industrial Bureau. In this embezzlement case, he used his power to extort merchants. It has only been found that he embezzled more than RMB 2.7 million and watches, sweaters, and other items, and ate and drank with merchants dozens of times. His accounts are still unclear. In order to achieve the purpose of accepting bribes, he bought materials from merchants at high prices. Buying steel only four times cost more than RMB 100 million. As the director of the section, he led the cadres and staff of the section to embezzle, violate discipline, and engage in irregularities; and in the past, when working in central Jiangsu, he and Xu Fushun used public funds to sell gold for profit, which shows that embezzlement was consistent. After this embezzlement and bribery case was discovered, he still avoided the important and took the light, and did not completely confess to the party. It was decided to expel him from the party, and he has been removed from his post and sent to the court for legal punishment.

II. Fan Gang—from Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, 38 years old. His family background was that of a staff member, and his personal background was that of a student. He started working in 1939 and joined the party in 1940. He has served as squad leader, company commander, accounting director, and first deputy director of the business section. He served as a member of the general branch and secretary of the branch in the party. He usually colluded with Xu Shanzhi, Liu Xiaoci, Liu Zijie, and others, and enjoyed corruption. It has been found that he embezzled and accepted bribes of more than RMB 1.8 million, three watches, a radio, and other clothing. He bought 445 kilograms of scrap iron in Shanghai, and the payment was made long ago, but the goods did not arrive; later, Fan Gang falsely claimed that the goods were "lost." In 1949, he deposited public funds in a bank in Tianjin to generate interest, earning 7 million North Sea currency. After the anti-corruption struggle in the business section began, he still extorted merchants in Shanghai. He usually held the party branch and organized attacks and slanders against the whistleblower. When the embezzlement incident was exposed, he still tried his best to deny it and refused to confess. It was decided to expel him from the party, and he has been removed from his post and sent to the court for legal punishment.

III. Xu Shanzhi—from Shanghai, 28 years old. His family background was that of an urban poor, and his personal background was that of a worker. He started working in 1942 and joined the party in the same year. Xu Shanzhi colluded with counter-revolutionary elements Liu Zijie, Zhang Qingji, and unscrupulous merchant Li Yaonan to mastermind the theft and sale of inventory materials, selling a total of 30.02 million North Sea currency and sharing the spoils together. In addition, he embezzled and accepted bribes of more than RMB 5.4 million and 100 "actual unit" shares, as well as watches and fountain pens. After Yang Zhongyu was reported, in order to cover up his crimes, he and Fan Gang and others organized attacks on the whistleblower. After Yang Zhongyu was sent to the court, he subsidized Yang Zhongyu's family for 250,000 yuan in two months. He held three meetings with Liu Zijie, Zhang Qingji, and other counter-revolutionary elements to conspire to resist the anti-corruption struggle. Xu Shanzhi even threatened Su Baocheng with a gun, saying: "Whoever confesses will be killed!" This shows that Xu Shanzhi has completely embarked on the counter-revolutionary road of betraying the party. It was decided to expel him from the party, and he has been sent to the court for legal punishment.

IV. Song Deliang—from Nantong County, Jiangsu Province, 26 years old. His family background was that of an urban poor, and his personal background was that of an apprentice. He started working in 1945 and joined the party in 1948. In 1949, he took public funds in Yantai and made gold business through private merchants, embezzling from it. He embezzled tax money in Tianjin. He colluded with private merchants in Shanghai and privately revised contracts. It has only been found that he embezzled and accepted bribes of more than RMB 2.9 million, two watches, one fountain pen, one slide rule, three steel rulers, and other items. He accepted bribes from private merchants and bought unusable inferior goods at high prices when buying adjustable wrenches, causing huge losses to the state.

V. Xu Fushun—from Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, 28 years old. His family background was that of a poor peasant, and his personal background was that of a worker. He started working in 1941 and joined the party in 1943. During his tenure as the second deputy director of the business office, he frequently accepted invitations and gifts from merchants and borrowed money from merchants. It has been found that he embezzled more than RMB 2.2 million, two watches, one piece of cowhide, and other items. He had committed embezzlement errors with Lu Yuan in the past.

The above two people committed serious mistakes and showed bad qualities, but they can still confess. It was decided to give them a two-year probation within the party and suggest that the administrative side give them a demotion.

VI. Liu Dianhai—from Wuqiao County, Shandong Province, 23 years old. He joined the party in 1945 and started working in 1946. It has been found that he embezzled RMB 380,000 and fountain pens and clothes during his tenure as the head of the business group of the business section. However, because it was his first offense, it was decided to give him a public warning and suggest that the administrative side give him a demotion.

In addition to Yang Zhongyu, who has been sent to the court for sentencing, Liu Dianfang, who has been dismissed, and counter-revolutionary elements Liu Xiaoci, etc., who have been arrested and dealt with by the Public Security Bureau, Yan Su, Quan Rongtang, Chen Shusen, etc., will be given demotion or demerit punishments by the administrative side.

Wang Xinmin and Dong Zhongchi, who suppressed the anti-corruption struggle, were punished

The leadership of the Industrial Bureau turned a blind eye to such serious embezzlement and corruption, fraudulent and illegal activities, undermining policies, and chaotic operations for a long time. Even after preliminary information was exposed during the rectification, they still did not investigate. When someone reported it, they did not pay attention to it and still acted emotionally, indulging and protecting the embezzlers, causing the whistleblower to be attacked and suppressed. Under the repeated instructions of the Jinan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC, although they gradually changed, this problem could not be resolved in time. Therefore, the leading cadres of the Industrial Bureau not only bear major responsibility for this case but also made serious mistakes in handling this case. Comrade Wang Xinmin, secretary of the Industrial Bureau Party Committee, should bear the main responsibility for overall leadership, and Comrade Dong Zhongchi, deputy secretary of the Party Committee, should bear the direct responsibility for specific leadership. In order to learn from the past and avoid future mistakes, it was decided to punish Comrades Wang Xinmin and Dong Zhongchi. The entire leadership style and cadre policy within the Industrial Bureau's party must be continuously inspected, rectified, and improved. The Industrial Bureau Party Committee should educate the comrades in the general branch and branch of the Industrial Bureau who have committed the mistake of sympathizing with and shielding the embezzlers and instruct them to make a profound self-criticism.

Comrade Cui Zhusan, deputy head of the business section of the Industrial Bureau, stood firm on the party's position, disregarding attacks and suppression, resolutely exposed and opposed the embezzlers, and promptly reported the situation to the higher authorities. These actions are correct. This spirit of actively taking responsibility for the party and resolutely safeguarding the party's interests demonstrates the excellent qualities of a communist party member. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Jinan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC decided to commend him.

    济南工业局经营科发生集体贪污受贿案
    贪污犯陆原等受党纪国法制裁
    崔祝三同志积极斗争揭发贪污事件受到表扬
    华东工业部济南工业局经营科发生巨大贪污受贿案件。对于其中有关的党员干部，中共济南市委纪律检查委员会已做出处理决定，报请上级党委批准，给以党纪处分。下面是这个决定的摘要：
    华东工业部济南工业局经营科干部职员集体贪污受贿、盗卖物资、破坏政策、违法乱纪的案件，是极其严重而复杂的。自一九五一年一月份发现这个事件后，中共济南市委就派人去检查，并责成工业局党委彻底处理。中共中央山东分局纪律检查处也派人帮助济南市委深入进行检查。到去年七月初，才把这一案件的真实情况最后弄清。参加这次贪污案的有经营科的六个党员干部、六个非党职员，秘书科的一个非党职员。这批贪污分子，以经营科科长陆原、副科长樊刚（都是党员）为首，另有营业室正副主任徐善芝、宋德良、徐福顺三人（都是党员），营业组组长刘佃海（党员）、刘殿芳、严肃三人，以及采购员陈树森、权荣堂、会计员刘孝慈（反革命分子，已被公安机关逮捕）、统计调查员杨螽羽、事务员臧阶平等五人。因此，这一贪污案件是有组织的集体贪污行为；并以营业室作为舞弊犯法的核心。这一案件和工业局三厂的反革命分子刘子杰（刘孝慈的弟弟）、张庆吉等（都已被公安机关逮捕）盗卖库存物资案件也有很大牵连。
    据调查，他们贪污的手段是：违反经营方针，接受私商大量贿赂，敲诈商人并无耻地恳求商人资助
    “解决家庭困难”，勾串奸商造假货单，把公款存在银行生息自肥，走私漏税，贪污税款，盗卖国家物资等等。这些贪污分子在生活上腐化堕落，和商人一起吃喝看戏已公然成风，甚至经常和商人一道赌博、嫖妓女。樊刚和反革命分子刘孝慈的妹妹结婚，和刘孝慈结为心腹。一九四九年整编时，党的组织曾派党员干部到经营科工作，他们竟拒不收留。这次案情被发觉后，徐善芝多次和反革命分子一起密谋对策。由于贪污腐化，不知悔改，他结果堕落到走上反革命的道路。贪污受贿违法乱纪的主要事实
    陆原等犯贪污违法的主要事实如下：
    一、现在已经查明的，仅受贿和存公款生息两项就贪污人民币二千零五十多万元、北海币七百多万元和一百个折实单位，十七钻的游泳表十二块，钢笔七支，其他如计算尺、钢尺、钳子、收音机、鞋、帽、衣物、米、面、煤炭等日用品无法统计。最严重的是徐善芝勾结暗藏在三厂的反革命分子盗卖库存物资，计有硫酸十六坛、丝弦十六公斤、颜料数桶、厚薄尺六支、小螺丝数十匣，共卖得北海币三千零二十万元（按当时市价折合小米一万一千斤），共同分赃。此外，各人账目不清，长、短款数十万至数百万，一时难以查清。
    二、由于和私商勾结，出卖国家利益，造成国家资财的巨大损失，更是无法计算。如高价收买私商物资，最高的比市价高百分之一百三十七。仅据一九五零年很不完全的统计，所购私商物资，就有三十三次比市价高，共多化人民币二亿八千六百二十四万多元。经营科还买进劣货，以高价卖给自己的工厂。如生铁，市价每公斤人民币一千八百元，经营科以两千四百元卖给工厂。因货劣不能应用，浪费就更大了。宋德良因接受上海商人曹永寿的贿赂，把品质低劣的一批八呎、十呎、十二呎的活洛搬手三百八十四把，以人民币三千三百六十万元高价买进（按当时行情只值二千八百三十二万元），至今仍然积压在库里，无法处理。同时，他们更大胆地包庇私商，为私商利益打算，擅自修改合同，使预付货款长期为私商借用，使生产受到影响。
    三、经营科采购人员和私商狼狈为奸，严重地走私偷税，或因受贿而放纵奸商不纳税，甚至同流合污，直接侵吞税款。仅据一九五○年一年极不完全的统计，就漏税一百二十多次。已查明的计有交易单、调拨单、合同等共漏印花税五百六十一万七千五百元，资本账漏印花税一亿九千五百一十六万六千六百元。陆原在青岛买原铁七百九十五公斤，仅货物税一项就有三十四万零七百三十一元，一文也没有缴。宋德良在天津买废报纸时，把商人交给他的二十三万四千四百一十二元的税款全部吞没，并包庇卖废报纸行商吴台峰漏行商税四十九万三千六百九十五元。经营科所漏税款共有人民币二亿零一百八十五万零四百三十三元。在他们纵容下，私商偷漏税款，更难查计。
    四、为了少出运输费和少报税率，他们竟不顾人民生命的安全，经常把易燃物品“硝酸氨”原料冒充肥田粉运输，共计六百吨，少出运费人民币二亿二千七百九十九万四千元。他们把一级爆炸性原料“海扫根”五十公斤和黑铅粉混在一起运输，把易燃品黑油纸冒充普通纸运输。这样不仅违犯人民铁路规章，而且危险极大，今春经营科所运“硝酸氨”就在济南车站发生火险。但经营科以及工业局领导干部却一直没有注意。
    以上贪污犯罪行为，给党和国家造成的损失是不可补偿的。这些事实也证明了工业局经营业务上的混乱。单以和私商大量交易不经当地贸易机关统一采购而论，就是一种非法行为。同时，这些人员已经丧失了国营企业人员的应有品质，他们所作所为，已堕落成为投机奸商的行为，严重地破坏了国营企业的政治威信。这一贪污集团竟然是以党员干部为首。这些党员在入城以后的环境中，经不起考验，完全蜕化了。徐善芝甚至堕落到反革命的立场。工业局领导方面对他们长期姑息放纵，使他们的犯罪行为发展到不可收拾的地步，对这个事件也是应该负责任的。崔祝三积极向贪污行为作斗争
    工业局经营科的贪污案件，是由经营科第二副科长崔祝三同志（党员）检举而被发觉的。他在这次反贪污斗争中自始至终起了积极作用。可是，他却不但遭受过贪污分子的有组织的攻击和诬陷，而且也遭受到工业局领导方面的打击和压抑。当最初崔祝三同志检举杨螽羽的贪污事实，接着又牵连到徐善芝、臧阶平等三人集体贪污的事实时，樊刚就把持着机关党的支部，百般阻挠，说崔祝三同志“这样搞得草木皆兵不行”；并向上级反映：“崔祝三是对杨螽羽施行报复。崔祝三也有贪污行为。”樊刚去上海后，还写信给工业局党委，提出：“如果不处理崔祝三，就向华东局控告。”机关党的支部委员会在总支部书记苗丰雨、工业局党委组织干事纪学明等的支持下，也极力压制对徐善芝的追究。
    工业局领导方面在这一事件中竟颠倒是非，几次拒绝采纳崔祝三同志的建议，反而说：“你科有贪污，你也有责任！”令崔祝三同志反省。崔祝三同志迫不得已，便直接向中共中央山东分局和中共济南市委控告。杨螽羽被送法院后，工业局党委对徐善芝仍不严加追究。甚至臧阶平已坦白出修理门市部时经徐善芝批准假造预算、贪污款项，三人共同吃喝五十多次的情况后，工业局党委副书记董仲池还在大会上武断地说“徐善芝是同流合污，没有分赃”，极力袒护徐善芝。
    中共中央山东分局和中共济南市委责成工业局党委必须彻查贪污案件之后，工业局领导方面仍然强调经营科是闹“干部关系”问题，强调崔祝三同志“作风不正派”、“也有贪污行为”。工业局党委书记王新民向中共济南市委反映：“崔祝三简直不像个共产党员，如不处理，经营科干部就要辞职了！”并布置大会，想“斗争”崔祝三（后经市委制止）。又派人查崔祝三的账目，多方搜集崔祝三的生活细节和历史材料；还曾三次通知崔祝三到上海受训。工业局党委副书记董仲池在很长时期内想不通，曾再三向中共济南市委写信，牢骚不满，说市委“听片面之词”，对市委指示表现了抗拒态度。
    经过中共济南市委的批评指正和多次会议的分析批判，工业局领导方面虽也有所转变，对贪污分子进行了追查，但在全部情况已经暴露之后，工业局党委仍然强调事后必须处理崔祝三。工业局党委在第一次处理报告中，对因贪污招致国家资财的巨大损失一事仍然没有总结教训，仅简单列举每人受贿数目了事。直到最后，经中共中央山东分局纪律检查处帮助中共济南市委重新进行深入检查，又发现了更多的严重材料，并查明崔祝三确无贪污事实之后，工业局党委负责人才承认在这个问题上确实有错误；但对自己的错误的认识仍是不够的。
    工业局党委领导干部在干部政策上“用人唯亲”，凡事凭“老上级”、“老部下”的关系，无原则地信任自己所喜爱的干部，邪正不分，毫无党的原则立场，对待问题缺乏严肃正确的态度。党委的作风，是不民主的，没有实行党委制，不能开展思想斗争，不能发挥党委的集体领导作用，形成个人决定
    一切的家长制作风。凡对领导方面有不同意见的，就遭到压制，甚至受到打击和报复。领导方面的这种作风就助长了犯错误的人员拒不接受批评的气焰，拖延了对这个案件的处理。贪污的党员受到党纪制裁
    为严肃党纪，中共济南市委纪律检查委员会对贪污案件中有关的党员干部，决定给以党纪处分，并已报请上级党委批准。
    一、陆原——江苏武进县人，三十六岁。家庭成份是贫农，个人出身是手工业工人。一九四零年参加工作，一九四一年第一次入党，曾因贪污腐化被开除党籍。一九四三年重新入党。历任管理员、股长、工业局经营科长。在这次贪污案件中，他利用职权勒索商人。仅查明的就贪污了人民币二百七十多万元和手表、毛衣等物，和商人吃喝数十次。他的账目至今不清。为达到受贿目的，他曾高价收买商人物资。仅买钢四次，就多化人民币一亿多元。他身为科长，率领本科干部、职员贪污乱纪；而且过去在苏中工作时，曾和徐福顺用公款贩卖金子，从中牟利，可见贪污是一贯的。这次贪污受贿案件被发觉后，仍避重就轻，不向党彻底坦白。决定开除他的党籍，并已撤销职务，送法院依法惩办。
    二、樊刚——江苏苏州人，三十八岁。家庭成份是职员，个人出身是学生。一九三九年参加工作，一九四零年入党。历任班长、连长、会计主任、经营科第一副科长。在党内任总支部委员、支部书记。平日和徐善芝、刘孝慈、刘子杰等结为一气，腐化享乐。已查明的他贪污受贿的物资有人民币一百八十多万元，手表三块，收音机一架和其他衣服等。他在上海买糟子铁四百四十五公斤，支款多时而货物没有到；后来樊刚竟诡称货物“损失了”。一九四九年他在天津把公款存入银行生息，渔利北海币七百万元。经营科反贪污斗争开始后，他在上海，仍敲诈商人。他平时把持党的支部，有组织地对检举人攻击诬陷。当贪污事件被揭露后，他仍百般抵赖，拒不坦白。决定开除他的党籍，并已撤销职务，送法院依法惩办。
    三、徐善芝——上海人，二十八岁。家庭成份是城市贫民，个人出身是工人。一九四二年参加工作，同年入党。徐善芝曾勾结反革命分子刘子杰、张庆吉和奸商李耀南等主谋盗卖库存物资，共卖北海币三千零二十万元，共同分赃。此外，他并贪污受贿人民币五百四十多万元和一百个折实单位，以及手表、钢笔等物。当杨螽羽被检举后，他为掩盖罪恶，曾和樊刚等有组织地向检举人进行攻击。在杨螽羽被送法院后，他在两个月内共津贴杨螽羽的家属二十五万元。他和刘子杰、张庆吉等反革命分子开会三次，阴谋抗拒反贪污斗争。徐善芝更用手枪威胁苏保成说：“谁坦白打死谁！”这说明徐善芝已完全走上叛党的反革命道路。决定开除他的党籍，并已送法院依法惩办。
    四、宋德良——江苏南通县人，二十六岁。家庭成份是城市贫民，个人出身是学徒。一九四五年参加工作，一九四八年入党。一九四九年在烟台拿公款通过私商作金子生意，从中贪污。在天津曾贪污税款。曾和上海私商勾结，私改合同。仅查明的贪污受贿就有人民币二百九十余万元，手表两块，钢笔一支，计算尺一卷，钢尺三支及其他物品等。他受了私商的贿赂，买活洛搬手时以高价买回不能用的劣货，给国家造成巨大损失。
    五、徐福顺——江苏启东县人，二十八岁。家庭成份是贫农，个人出身是工人。一九四一年参加工作，一九四三年入党。在任营业室第二副主任期间，经常接受商人请客送礼，向商人借钱。计查出贪污人民币二百二十余万元，手表两块，牛皮一张及其他物品等。过去就曾和陆原一起犯过贪污的错误。
    以上二人所犯错误严重，表现了品质恶劣，但还能坦白。决定给予留党察看二年的处分，并建议行政方面给予撤职处分。
    六、刘佃海——山东吴桥县人，二十三岁。一九四五年入党，一九四六年参加工作。已查出他在任经营科营业组长期间，曾贪污人民币三十八万元及钢笔、衣服等。但因为是初犯错误，所以决定给予当众警告的处分，并建议行政方面给予撤职处分。
    其他非党人员，除杨螽羽已送法院判罪、刘殿芳已被解职、反革命分子刘孝慈等已由公安局逮捕处理外，另有严肃、权荣堂、陈树森等，将由行政方面分别给予撤职或记过处分。压制反贪污斗争的王新民、
    董仲池受到处分
    工业局领导方面对这样严重的贪污腐化、作奸犯法、破坏政策、混乱经营的行为长时期熟视无睹，甚至在整风时已经暴露出来了初步情况之后，仍然不追查，当有人检举时还不重视，仍然感情用事，对贪污分子姑息、袒护，使检举者受到打击和压制。他们在中共济南市委的多次指示下，虽然逐渐有所转变，但已使这一问题不能及时解决。因此，工业局领导干部不仅对这一案件负有重大责任，而且在处理这一案件中是有严重错误的。这应由工业局党委书记王新民同志负全部领导上的主要责任，党委副书记董仲池同志负具体领导上的直接责任。为了惩前毖后，决定给予王新民、董仲池两同志以处分。对于工业局党内的整个领导作风、干部政策等方面，必须继续加以检查、整顿和改善。对于工业局机关总支部、支部中犯同情、包庇贪污分子错误的同志，应由工业局党委进行教育，并责成他们作深刻的检讨。
    工业局经营科副科长崔祝三同志，站稳党的立场，不顾打击压制，坚决检举、反对贪污分子，并及时向上级反映情况，这些行动是正确的。这种积极对党负责，坚决维护党的利益的精神，表现了共产党员的优良品质。中共济南市委纪律检查委员会决定予以表扬。
