Commended After Reporting Embezzlers, Resolves to Continue Assisting the Government in Anti-Corruption Efforts

On December 29th of last year, Comrade Zhao Qian from the police station, who manages "special trades," brought Comrade Zhang Yichen from the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government. Comrade Zhang was amiable, had a smiling face, and shook my hand warmly. Then, he took out a letter from the Savings Inspection Committee of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government for me. The letter read: "Your firm's report of Zhang Jinrui, a student at the Medical School, stealing and selling state property is a manifestation of patriotism, and we are very grateful! We are specially introducing Comrade Zhang Yichen to visit and express our appreciation." After reading the letter, I felt indescribable gratitude and shame. I thought: I only fulfilled a small obligation, which is the responsibility of the people, but I have received repeated praise from the People's Government. This incident made me deeply feel the difference between the old and new societies. We small business people had no status under the rule of the reactionary government. After liberation, through study and the help of working cadres, I recognized my position as a master of the country. This incident has given me much enlightenment and education. In the future, I will intensify my studies, work hard, fulfill the responsibilities that we people should bear, respond to all the government's calls, and earnestly implement the patriotic pact. Currently, in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, we should, in the spirit of "saying everything we know and saying it without reservation," feel at ease, dispel our worries, and further raise our awareness. With the attitude of being masters of the country, we should assist the government in doing a good job in anti-corruption and anti-bribery work. Finally, I also hope that comrades in the second-hand goods industry and "special trades" will pay attention at all times, recognize their position and responsibility. In addition to complying with government laws and regulations, we must also be careful of lawbreakers and thieves who try to take advantage of us. Let us organize ourselves to make lawbreakers and bad people have nowhere to hide. I hope my colleagues will encourage each other.

    检举贪污分子后受到表扬决心继续协助政府反贪污
    去年十二月二十九日，派出所管理“特行”的赵谦同志，领来中央人民政府卫生部的张一忱同志。张同志和蔼可亲、满面笑容，和我很亲切地握了握手，然后拿出中央人民政府卫生部节约检查委员会给我的一封信。信上写道：“贵号日前检举医士学校学员张金瑞盗卖国家财产事件，实为爱国主义的表现，我们甚表感谢！兹特介绍张一忱同志前往慰问。”我读完信后，心中有说不出来的感激和惭愧。我想：我只尽了一点小义务，这是人民应负的责任，但是，却受到人民政府一再地表扬。这事使我深深地感到新旧社会的不同。我们小买卖人，在反动政府统治下，是没有地位的。解放后，经过学习和工作干部的帮助，我认识了自己的主人翁地位。这一次事件，又给了我许多启发和教育。今后，我更要加紧学习，努力前进，负起我们人民应有的责任，响应政府的一切号召，认真执行爱国公约。目前，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我们应当本着“知无不言，言无不尽”的精神，放心大胆、去掉顾虑、进一步地提高觉悟，以主人翁的态度，协助政府做好反贪污、反行贿工作。最后，我还希望旧货业及“特行”同志们，更要时刻注意，认清自己的立场和责任。我们除了遵守政府法令及管理规则外，还要当心不法分子及贼人来钻空子侵害我们。大家组织起来，使不法分子和坏人无地自容。希我同业共勉。
