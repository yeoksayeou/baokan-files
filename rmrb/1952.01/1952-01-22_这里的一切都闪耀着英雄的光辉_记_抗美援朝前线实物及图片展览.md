The Volunteer Army delegation's return to the motherland not only brought back the soldiers' love for the motherland and its people but also a collection of items personally used by the soldiers and dozens of pictures recording their heroic deeds. Through these objects and pictures, people seem to see the heroes on the Korean battlefield. Here is the bayonet captured from the American army by combat hero Cui Jianguo. He used this bayonet, less than a foot long, to kill six American soldiers in the battle north of Hongcheon on May 14th of last year. Over there, there is the shovel of Wei Ming, a machine gun squad soldier from a certain unit. He used this shovel to chop down two American bandits. There is also the "cannon firing board" used by Niu Zhenxiao, a Communist Party member and soldier of the artillery first company of a certain unit. This was during the Battle of Maliangshan on November 4th of last year. When Niu Zhenxiao's mountain gun malfunctioned while supporting the infantry's counterattack against the enemy, he removed the firing mechanism from the gun, kicked open an ammunition box, and used a piece of wood to strike the firing pin to launch shells, firing 240 shells in succession. Two hundred and thirty-six of them hit the target, eliminating more than forty enemies. Heroic Comrade Niu Zhenxiao later gloriously sacrificed himself on the Korean front. To commemorate him, the soldiers engraved the words "You are also a meritorious thing" on this piece of wood and entrusted the delegation to bring it back to the motherland for exhibition.

The great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was achieved by the soldiers overcoming countless difficulties. People will be moved by the dozens of shovels and picks on display at the exhibition. The soldiers used these tools every day to build fortifications, protect themselves, and strike the enemy. When the pickaxes became dull, the soldiers heated them red and used stones to hammer out new points. When the steel was worn away, picks that were a foot and a half or six inches long were reduced to three or four inches; picks that were eight inches long were worn down to the size of a teacup. Here is a shovel left behind by martyr Luo Yonglin, captured from the enemy during the Fifth Battle. This shovel, in the hands of the hero, dug sixty-seven air-raid shelters, thirty-five individual shelters, and four hundred meters of trenches. It accompanied martyr Luo Yonglin in eliminating fifty-two enemies and earned him two second-class merits.

Our Volunteer Army is not only a heroic force but also a model of cherishing and saving the motherland's resources. Here, there are straw sandals woven by the soldiers in their spare time; there are car tires that have been repaired thousands of times by the soldiers; there are clothes and socks that have been sewn and patched again and again by the soldiers. One soldier wrote a clapper rhyme for the socks he wore: "These socks are stitched with dense thread, the love of the people of the motherland is in the middle, thousands of threads represent thousands of hearts, remembering those who plant grain when eating. Although they are broken and tattered now, the people's sweat and blood are remembered in my heart. Hand over more weapons and kill more enemies, vowing to win glory for the people of the motherland." In the pictures over there, we can see the soldiers building warehouses in the woods, covered with thatch, with wood propping them up high to prevent damage to the grain supplied by the people of the motherland. Over there, we can see the soldiers sweeping up scattered grain, grain by grain. On the other side, we can see the various wild vegetables that the soldiers used to fill their stomachs in special circumstances. Many viewers left the same comments after visiting here: Learn from the spirit of the Volunteer Army, I will better carry out the increase production and practice economy movement, and participate in the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

The wisdom of the soldiers is not only manifested in combat, but the countless creations in daily life make people think of how clever our soldiers are as builders! After receiving canned goods from the people of the motherland supporting the front lines, the Volunteer Army kept the empty cans and manufactured hundreds of tools. From steamers, lunch boxes, stoves, and water buckets to bedpans for the wounded, they could all be made from them. Here is a set of simple saws and planes made from scrap iron from enemy planes, and the soldiers used them to saw down three hundred trees and build five houses.

Our soldiers are full of optimism. They did not forget to use their own strength to create cultural and recreational activities even in the midst of arduous battles. They made countless large and small fiddles from canned skins and scrap iron wire; they established clubs on the battlefield with the books and newspapers sent by the people of the motherland. The soldiers of another unit made a "wooden zither" with twenty-nine strings from wooden boards, screws, and iron wire from discarded electrical wires. The battlefield lacked paper, so the soldiers used corn husks, leaves, and rags to write words and put up wall newspapers.

The heroes who hate the enemy and love life cherish the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people even more. Here are dozens of silk banners presented to the heroes by the Korean people; here are photos of the soldiers having a meal with the Korean people on National Day; here, the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are chatting happily on the front lines; here, the soldiers are helping Korean farmers with the autumn harvest; here, Korean women are transporting grain for the soldiers; here, the soldiers use their raincoats to build a house for a group of women and children whose homes were destroyed by the American bandits.

The Volunteer Army comrades, who are always concerned about the motherland, were extremely happy to hear that representatives would be sent back home. Gu Haiquan, a soldier from a certain unit, was troubled when he heard that memorable items from the front lines would be brought back to the motherland for exhibition. He thought: What do I have that is worth bringing back? He thought for a long time before he came up with a solution. He said: "Send my single army cap to the people of the motherland for them to see!" This army cap had accompanied him through five battles and three months of blocking action and was slightly torn on the enemy's barbed wire during one charge. He entrusted this cap to the delegation to bring back to the motherland and even wrote a clapper rhyme for it.

Everything here shines with the glory of heroes!

    这里的一切都闪耀着英雄的光辉
    ——记“抗美援朝前线实物及图片展览”
    这次志愿军归国代表团回到祖国，不独带回了战士们热爱祖国、热爱祖国人民的心，还带回了一批战士们亲手使用过的实物和几十幅记录了战士们英勇事迹的图片。通过这些实物和图片，人们好像见到了在朝鲜战地上的英雄们。这里有战斗英雄崔建国从美军手里缴来的一把刺刀，他用这把不满一尺长的刺刀，在去年五月十四日洪川以北战斗中，接连刺死了六个美国兵。那边，有某部机枪班战士魏明的一把铁锹，他使用这把铁锹曾经砍掉两个美国强盗。还有某部炮兵一连战士、共产党员牛振孝使用过的“打炮板”。这是在去年十一月四日的马良山战斗中，牛振孝的山炮在配合步兵向敌人反击时发生了故障，他就去掉炮上的拉火，一脚踏破一只炮弹箱，取下一块木板，用它来敲打撞针发炮，连续射出了二百四十发炮弹。其中二百三十六发命中了目标，消灭了四十多个敌人。英雄的牛振孝同志后来在朝鲜前线光荣牺牲了。战士们为了纪念他，就在这块立木板上刻着：“你也是一件有功的东西”几个字，交给代表团带到祖国来展览。
    志愿军的伟大胜利，是战士们克服了无数的困难争取来的。人们都会为展览会上的几十把铁锹、铁镐所感动。这些工具，战士们天天用它们来修筑工事，保全了自己，打击了敌人。铁镐磨秃了，战士们把它烧红用石头打出尖头来再使。钢铁被磨融了，一尺五六寸长的镐，剩下三四寸；八寸长的镐，磨得只剩下茶杯大一小块。这里有烈士罗永林遗下的一把铁锹，这是在第五次战役中从敌人手中缴获来的。这把锹，在英雄的手里挖了六十七个防空洞，三十五个单人掩体和四百公尺长的壕沟。它伴着罗永林烈士消灭了五十二个敌人，立了两次二等功。
    我们的志愿军不独是一支英雄部队，而且是爱护和节约祖国物资的模范。这里，有战士们利用空隙时间自己编织的草鞋；有经过战士们千修万补的汽车轮胎；有经过战士们缝了又缝、补了再补的衣服和鞋袜。一位战士为他穿的袜子写了这样一首快板：“这双袜子密线缝，祖国人民热爱在当中，千万条线来千万个心，吃饭不忘种谷人。如今虽然破又烂，人民血汗记心中。多缴武器多杀敌，誓为祖国人民争光荣。”在那边的图片里，我们可以看到战士们在树林紧张地建造仓库，上面盖着茅草，下面高高地垫着木头，使祖国人民支援的粮食不受损失。在那边，我们可以看到战士们一颗一粒地在扫拾散落的粮食。另一边，我们可以看到战士们在特殊情况下用以充饥的多种野菜。许多观众在这里参观后留下了同样的意见：学习志愿军的精神，我要更好地开展增产节约运动，参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争。
    战士们的智慧不但表现在战斗中，在日常生活中的无数种创造，更使人想到我们的战士们是多么聪明的建设者啊！志愿军收到了祖国人民支援前线的罐头，把吃过以后的空盒留下来，制造了成百种工具。从蒸笼、饭盒、火炉、水桶到伤员用的大便器，都可以用它制造出来。这里有一套用敌人飞机上的废铁制成的简单的锯子和刨子，战士们就用它们锯了三百多颗树，建造了五所房子。
    我们的战士充满了乐观主义的精神。他们在艰苦的战斗中也没有忘记用自己的力量来创造文化娱乐生活。他们用罐头皮和废铁丝制成了大大小小的无数把胡琴；他们把祖国人民送去的书报在战地上建立了俱乐部。另部的战士们用木板、螺丝钉和废电线里的铁丝，制成了一具装有二十九根弦的“木琴”。战地上缺少纸张，战士们就用苞米叶子、树叶和破布写字出墙报。
    憎恨敌人，热爱生活的英雄们，更珍贵中朝人民的友谊，这里，有几十幅朝鲜人民送给英雄们的锦旗；这里有战士们在国庆节和朝鲜人民会餐的照片；这里，是志愿军和朝鲜人民军在阵地上欢叙；这里，是战士们在帮助朝鲜农民秋收；这里，是朝鲜的妇女在为战士们运粮；这里战士们用自己的雨衣搭成一座房子，给一群被美国强盗毁坏了家园的妇女儿童居住。
    时刻关怀着祖国的志愿军同志们，听说要派代表回国，都高兴极了。某部战士顾海全听说要把前线值得纪念的东西带回祖国展览，他心里就为难了。他想：我有什么东西值得带回去呢？他想了很久才有了办法，他说：“把我这顶单军帽送给祖国人民看看吧！”这顶军帽，曾随同他经过了五次战役和三个月的阻击战，在一次冲锋中在敌人的铁丝网上挂破了点。他把这顶帽子托代表团带回祖国，特地还为它编了一首快板。
    这里的每一件东西都闪耀着英雄的光辉！
