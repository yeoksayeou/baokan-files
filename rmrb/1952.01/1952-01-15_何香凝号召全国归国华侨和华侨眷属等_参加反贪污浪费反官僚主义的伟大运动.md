Xinhua News Agency, January 12th—He Xiangning, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, recently published two open letters, calling on returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese students, and returned distressed overseas Chinese who had been persecuted by imperialists to enthusiastically participate in the great movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

In a letter to returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese students on January 6th, He Xiangning first extended warm greetings to them, and pointed out that Chairman Mao's call to the people of the country for increased production and frugality is of great significance. He Xiangning said: I hope you can respond to Chairman Mao's call with practical actions, work hard and endure hardship, and invest your surplus wealth in productive undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihoods, such as the sugar industry, mining industry, rubber industry, transportation industry, fishing industry, water conservancy, and various agricultural and handicraft industries, to add strength to the country's economic construction. The management personnel of various enterprises should further develop their potential capabilities, improve technology, improve product quality, and reduce costs, so as to accumulate valuable construction funds for the country.

He Xiangning pointed out: The movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is an important key to changing customs and establishing a good atmosphere among the people of the country. It is hoped that some relatives of overseas Chinese who have been infected with the old social work style and old habits of idleness should pay special attention and cultivate the new virtues of thrift and diligence through this study.

In a letter to the returned distressed overseas Chinese on January 4th, He Xiangning told them that Chairman Mao and the leaders of governments at all levels are very concerned about and care for them.

He Xiangning pointed out the important significance of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the letter, and called on the returned distressed overseas Chinese, under the guidance of the local people's government and the relief committee for distressed overseas Chinese and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, to work hard in production, study intensively, be honest and hardworking, organize themselves, help each other, and advance under the leadership of the great people's leader Chairman Mao.
