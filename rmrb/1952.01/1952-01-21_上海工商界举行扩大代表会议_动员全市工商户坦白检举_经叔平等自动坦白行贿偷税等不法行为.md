Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th. The Shanghai business community, in order to widely and deeply launch the movement against bribery, fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion, held an expanded representative meeting from the 15th to the 17th. More than 1,600 representatives from all districts and more than 270 industries in the city attended. The meeting listened to and discussed the mobilization report by Sheng Pihua, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, adopted a preliminary plan for the Shanghai business community to launch a movement against bribery, fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion, and nominated Sheng Pihua and 75 others to form the Shanghai Business Community Anti-Bribery, Anti-Fraud, Anti-Profiteering, and Anti-Tax Evasion Movement Committee.

More than half of the meeting time was spent on group discussions, so that the representatives first clearly understood that this movement is a serious struggle for self-transformation in the business community. In the representatives' speeches, serious phenomena were exposed of some illegal elements in the Shanghai business community stealing state property and corrupting revolutionary cadres by despicable means. More than 200 of the representatives voluntarily confessed these facts at the meeting. The discussions also exposed various confused thoughts within the business community. For example, bribery such as treating and giving gifts to state cadres was described as "human nature." Some said, "If you don't cheat and tell the truth, the goods won't sell." Others said, "Seeing a profit of four cents, how can you be willing to sell at the negotiated price of two cents?" These capitalist thoughts and bad habits and styles of work brought from the old society have been initially criticized at the meeting.

During the discussions, the representatives also studied the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council and Bo Yibo, Director of the Central People's Government's Thrift Inspection Committee. They generally began to realize that this movement is paving the way for the development of legitimate industry and commerce for industrialists and businessmen and is in line with the basic spirit of the Common Program and the requirements of self-transformation for national industrialists and businessmen. Therefore, everyone expressed that they would work hard to publicize and mobilize their colleagues after returning, and take the lead in reviewing and confessing.

At the plenary session on the third day of the meeting, Jing Shuping and Chen Mingshan, both Executive Committee members and Standing Committee members of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, made self-criticisms and confessions. The conference also designated Dong Yinchu, Deputy Director of the International Trade Association and Manager of Jianyuan Company, Weng Minru, Director of the Hardware Business Association, and Zhu Peinong, Deputy Manager of Minfeng and Huafeng Paper Mills, to confess. Jing Shuping confessed that he had repeatedly concealed from the People's Government a portion of enemy and puppet shares in his Huaming Cigarette Factory, bribed the tax bureau's resident factory staff, evaded taxes, and violated financial management laws. Chen Mingshan confessed that his Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory had illegally exchanged foreign currency, evaded funds, and sought exorbitant profits. He said: "I am a representative of the Shanghai People's Representative Conference, but I have not served the people, but have harmed the interests of the people. My progress is hypocritical. In the past, I was always trying to cover up my dark and corrupt side." He said that he would bravely join this movement, work hard to fight against his ugly and corrupt side, and ask everyone to help him transform himself. Dong Yinchu confessed to concealing enemy and puppet materials and embezzling twelve tons of pig iron and more than three thousand catties of scrap iron. Weng Minru and Zhu Peinong also made confessions. When Zhu Peinong filed his income tax for 1950, he evaded more than 11.82 billion yuan in taxes, but during his confession, he also excused himself by saying that "the accounts are chaotic" and that the amount of tax evasion was not that large. He did not make a deep review of this criminal act of disregarding state taxation, which aroused great dissatisfaction among the representatives present. Many representatives submitted written opinions to the presidium on the spot, criticizing his dishonest attitude of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial in his confession. Sheng Pihua, the executive chairman of the conference, accepted the representatives' opinions, immediately conveyed them to Zhu Peinong, and asked him to re-confess and make a deep review.

Rong Yiren, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, made a summary of the meeting. He said: "This movement is a concrete action for the Shanghai business community to implement the Common Program, and it is also a concrete step in carrying out ideological transformation of the business community. I hope that all representatives will widely convey the spirit of this meeting to all industries and regions. Executive Committee members and Supervisory Committee members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and various trade associations, the offices of the Federation of Industry and Commerce in various districts, and the responsible personnel of various groups, must take the lead and set an example, inspect from top to bottom, fully promote democracy, and mobilize the masses. We must ensure that every household is inspected and everyone is mobilized, and strive to develop and complete this movement."

Finally, Hu Ziying, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, announced several specific steps for launching the movement: Within three days from the 18th to the 20th, representatives of all industries should complete the task of conveying the message within the industry system, and establish branches of the Shanghai Business Community Anti-Bribery, Anti-Fraud, Anti-Profiteering, and Anti-Tax Evasion Movement Committee; from the 21st to the 25th, representatives of various districts should complete the task of conveying the message in the business community in various districts. After the completion of the conveyance in various industries and regions, they should immediately organize study and conduct democratic inspection. Then, on the basis of democratic inspection, launch a confession and exposure movement.

    上海工商界举行扩大代表会议
    动员全市工商户坦白检举
    经叔平等自动坦白行贿偷税等不法行为
    【新华社上海十九日电】上海市工商界为广泛深入地发动反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动，在十五日至十七日举行了扩大代表会议，到会的有全市各区和二百七十多个行业的代表一千六百多人。会议听取和讨论了上海市工商业联合会主任委员盛丕华的动员报告，通过了上海市工商界开展反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动的初步方案，并推出盛丕华等七十五人组成上海市工商界反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动委员会。
    会议用一半以上的时间进行小组讨论，使到会代表首先明确认识这次运动是工商界进行自我改造的一场严重斗争。在代表们的发言中，暴露了上海工商界中许多不法分子用卑鄙龌龊的手段盗窃国家财产和腐蚀革命干部的严重现象，代表中就有二百多人在会上自动坦白了这些事实。在讨论中，也暴露了工商界内部的各种混乱思想。如把对国家干部请客、送礼等行贿行为说成是“人之常情”，说什么“不欺诈，讲了老实话，货物就卖不出去了”，“看到四分利，怎么肯照议价二分利就卖呢？”等等。这些资本主义思想和从旧社会带来的坏习惯、坏作风，已在会上受到了初步的批判。
    代表们在讨论中，并学习了政务院周恩来总理和中央人民政府节约检查委员会主任薄一波的报告，一般地已开始认识到这次运动对于工商业者来说，是为正当工商业的发展铺平道路，是符合共同纲领的基本精神和民族工商业家自我改造的要求的。因此，大家表示回去后一定努力向同业进行宣传动员，并带头检讨和坦白。
    在会议第三天的全体大会上，进行自我检讨和坦白的有上海市工商业联合会执行委员经叔平、常务委员陈铭珊二人。大会并指定国际贸易业公会副主任委员、建源公司经理董寅初，五金商业公会主任委员翁敏如，民丰、华丰造纸厂副经理竺培农等三人坦白。经叔平坦白了他曾向人民政府一再隐瞒在他所经营的华明烟厂中的一部分敌伪股本，向税务局驻厂员行贿，偷漏税款及违反金融管理法令等事实。陈铭珊坦白了他所经营的信谊药厂私套外汇，逃避资金，谋取暴利的事实。他说：“我是上海市各界人民代表会议的代表，但我没有为人民服务，反而损害了人民利益。我的进步是虚伪的，过去我总是在设法掩盖我黑暗、腐朽的一面。”他表示一定勇敢地投入这次运动，努力和自己的丑恶、腐朽的一面作斗争，并要求大家帮助他改造自己。董寅初坦白了隐瞒敌伪物资，并盗用生铁十二吨及地脚花三千多斤的违法事实。翁敏如、竺培农也作了坦白。竺培农在报缴一九五零年所得税时，曾偷漏税款一百十八亿二千多万元，但他在坦白时还藉口
    “账册混乱”，说偷漏数目没有这么大，更没有对这种漠视国家税收的犯罪行为作深刻检讨，引起到会代表的极大不满。许多代表当场向主席团提了书面意见，批评他在坦白中避重就轻的不老实态度。大会执行主席盛丕华接受了代表们的意见，立即转告竺培农，要他重新坦白，并作深刻检讨。
    会议由上海市工商业联合会副主任委员荣毅仁作总结。他说：“这次运动是上海市工商界执行共同纲领的一个具体行动，也是进行工商界思想改造的一个具体步骤。希望各位代表将这次会议的精神广泛地传达到各行各业各地区中去。工商业联合会和各同业公会的执行委员、监察委员们，工商业联合会在各区的办事处、各小组的负责人员们，都要亲自动手，以身作则，自上而下，带头检查，充分发扬民主，发动群众。必须做到户户检查，人人动员，为开展并完成这一运动而努力。”
    最后，由上海市工商业联合会秘书长胡子婴宣布了开展运动的几个具体步骤：十八日至二十日的三天内，各行各业代表应在行业系统内完成传达工作，并成立上海市工商界反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动委员会的分会；二十一日至二十五日，各区代表应完成在各区工商界中的传达工作。各行业各地区在传达完毕后，应立即组织学习，并进行民主检查。然后在民主检查的基础上展开坦白检举运动。
