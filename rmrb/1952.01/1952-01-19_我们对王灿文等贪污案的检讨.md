    Our Review of the Embezzlement Case of Wang Canwen and Others

    In September 1950, the Industry Department of the East China Military and Political Committee was manufacturing a large batch of motors and electrical machines, scheduled for delivery at the end of the year. Because this was the first large-scale unified order, it was necessary to inspect them to ensure the quality of equipment for basic construction in various regions. Therefore, the Jin Gang Testing Laboratory was established. Anxious for quick success, we rushed ahead based only on the preliminary plan of the inspection team, without thorough and precise calculations of personnel allocation and equipment needs. After repeated delays in the preparation work, repeated additions and alterations to the equipment, and two consecutive accidents, we began to suspect Wang Canwen, the person in charge of the motor section of the laboratory. At that time, we were in the midst of studying the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, so we seized the opportunity to investigate and, with the assistance of the masses, uncovered this massive embezzlement case. This incident exposed serious bureaucratic work styles in our leadership. Specific manifestations are as follows:

    First, we lacked a high degree of responsibility to the people, and therefore underestimated the corrupt practices brought from the old society by some retained personnel. We appointed and arranged staff members based only on superficial understanding, without deeply understanding their ideological consciousness and character beforehand, without analyzing their behavior and performance on a daily basis, and without taking the initiative to go deep into the masses to listen to feedback. Before the Wang Canwen embezzlement case was exposed, the Transportation Team of our office had an incident where employee Sun Xianglong stole and sold equipment and fled in fear of punishment. At that time, although we felt that corruption existed in our office, we did not learn from the experience, prevent loopholes, or systematically educate all comrades in the office. After the Wang Canwen embezzlement case was solved, examining every link in the case revealed many things that we should have noticed but did not. We in leadership should be responsible for all of it.

    At the same time, we failed to promptly struggle against the laissez-faire attitude of "none of my business" that clearly existed among our working comrades. Some working comrades, although they suspected that Wang Canwen was dismantling equipment in the laboratory, did not promptly report it to the leadership due to their laissez-faire thinking. This gave Wang Canwen an opportunity to engage in embezzlement.

    Second, we lacked planning and foresight in our leadership work, and we lacked meticulous consideration of issues. To establish such a crucial technical institution, we failed to make careful calculations regarding equipment and funding, and we failed to properly allocate the necessary cadres. We only saw that this testing institution could guarantee the quality of motors, and we were anxious to build it. Without deep consideration, we listened to Wang Canwen's opinion (he said: By using existing inventory and spending a small amount of money, and requesting the East China Branch of the National Materials Clearing and Allocation Committee to purchase some existing equipment, we could install it and conduct tests). We failed to raise our vigilance and meticulously study his conspiratorial preliminary design. We failed to estimate what scale such a testing institution should have to meet the needs of development. Furthermore, we did not consider personnel allocation and potential problems; we did not understand the principle that construction is impossible without a correct engineering design. Therefore, during the process, we lacked detailed construction plans, and we failed to conduct in-depth inspections. Later, upon being informed that the existing inventory and the equipment allocated by the branch were not entirely suitable, we passively signed and approved batches upon batches of purchases without review. Wang Canwen took advantage of our lack of planning, foresight, and vigilance, daring to systematically break things down into smaller parts, prepare budgets, delay work, and use the need for more equipment as a threat, gradually carrying out his criminal acts of theft, deception, and embezzlement.

    Third, we did not thoroughly consider and study whether the various work systems were reasonable and whether they should be supplemented or revised. We also failed to deeply inspect whether existing systems were being implemented and the actual situation of their implementation. As a result, the embezzler Wang Canwen exploited loopholes. Regarding the budget system, it was not strict enough, the review was not thorough, and the planning was not in-depth. When approving the budget, we did not review and study each item in detail, and we did not carefully verify supplementary budgets. The remaining balance in last month's budget was carried over to the next month without strict final accounting and re-examination. Thus, Wang Canwen's conspiracy to break things down into smaller parts, gradually supplement the budget, and engage in selling and deceptive purchases was fully realized. Regarding the procurement system, we did not properly study and inspect the approved procedures, the boundaries of layered responsibilities, the procedures for procurement and review, and the connections between relevant groups. Therefore, Wang Canwen was able to collude with purchasing agent Wang Er'ye to create trouble without being discovered. Regarding the procedures for inspecting materials, picking up goods, and acceptance, the system was neither detailed nor strictly enforced. Wang Canwen handled all procedures, including inspecting materials, picking up materials, escorting them, and accepting them, thereby stealing, swapping, and reselling large quantities of equipment, transporting them to his home and private warehouses, without our detection. This was mainly because we did not proactively study and inspect, and we did not listen to the opinions of the masses to revise and improve the system. We did not encourage the masses to promptly criticize and correct those who did not comply with the system, allowing Wang Canwen and other embezzlers to exploit the shortcomings of the system and the lack of attention to the system by some personnel, continuously engaging in embezzlement.

    Fourth, and more importantly, we did not rely on the masses or utilize their wisdom to help solve difficulties in our work. For example, the construction of the Jin Gang Testing Laboratory was not discussed with the relevant masses to solicit opinions, enrich the plan, and rely on the masses to ensure its completion. We relied solely on the subjective imagination of a few handlers, allowing Wang Canwen to act arbitrarily, tyrannically, and lawlessly. No one dared to offer opinions, the enthusiasm of the masses was suppressed, and the people's cause suffered enormous damage.

    The above are all manifestations of our bureaucratic work style. If we had a clear understanding of the seriousness and harm of corruption, if we had planned and foreseen our leadership work, if we had continuously studied, revised, and inspected the system, especially if we had implemented a leadership method that combined with the masses, in other words, if we did not have a bureaucratic work style, the Jin Gang Testing Laboratory should have been completed long ago, playing its role and making more contributions to national construction. And Wang Canwen's embezzlement crimes might not have developed to such a large extent, or might have been solved much earlier. Therefore, bureaucracy is indeed a breeding ground for corruption and waste. Today, we are launching a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The painful lessons of this case will educate us and all working comrades in the office, enabling us to achieve victory in this struggle.

### 我们对王灿文等贪污案的检讨

    我们对王灿文等贪污案的检讨
    华东军政委员会工业部经理处处长　金芝轩
    副处长　李白涛
    副处长　韩元佐
    一九五○年九月间，华东军政委员会工业部经理处承制的大批马达和电机，定在年底交货。因为这是第一次大规模的统一定货，必须加以检验，以保证各地基本建设设备的质量，因之筹设了金刚试验所。为了急于成功，只凭着检验组的初步计划，便匆匆搞起来了；而对人员的配备，设备的需要，却没有周详的、精确的计算。在筹备工作一再拖延、设备重复添改和连续发生两次事故后，才开始对试验所电机部分主管人王灿文有了怀疑。当时正在进行镇压反革命的学习，我们便抓紧时机，进行调查，并依靠群众的协助，揭发了这一巨大的贪污事件。这一事件暴露了我们领导方面有严重的官僚主义作风。具体表现如下：
    一、我们没有高度的对人民负责的精神，因之对一些留用人员从旧社会带来的贪污现象估计不足。对工作人员的任用与安排，只凭表面的认识，事前没有深刻了解他们的思想意识和品质，平日没有分析他们的行为和表现，也没有主动深入群众，听取反映。在王灿文贪污案被揭发以前，我处曾发生运务组职员孙祥龙盗卖器材畏罪潜逃事件。当时我们虽然感到贪污事情在本处是存在的，可是我们没有很好地接受经验教训，防止漏洞，没有有计划地深入教育全处同志。王灿文贪污案破获后，检查案情中每一个环节，有许多是我们应该注意而没有注意的，都是我们领导方面应该负责的。
    同时我们对于工作同志之间显然存在着的“事不关己、高高挂起”的自由主义倾向，没有及时地进行斗争；有些工作同志虽发觉王灿文在试验所有盗拆器材的嫌疑，但由于有自由主义的思想作风，也没有及时向领导方面反映。这就使王灿文有机可乘，进行贪污。
    二、我们在领导工作上缺乏计划性和预见性，对问题缺乏缜密的考虑。要创办这样一个责任重大的技术机构，我们对设备、经费未能精打细算，对需要的干部又未能适当配备。我们只看到这一个试验机构对电机质量上能起保证作用，便急于兴建；也没有经过深刻的考虑，便听信王灿文的意见。（他说：利用库存器材，化少数资金，向全国物资清理调配委员会华东分会请购部分现存器材，加以装置，便可进行试验。）对于他的具有阴谋的初步设计，没有能提高警惕，缜密研究；没有估计到这样一个试验机构，要有怎样的规模，才能适合发展的要求；更没有考虑到人事的配备和可能发生的问题；不懂得没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工的原则。因此，在进行中，我们没有详细的施工计划，也没有去深入检查，后来据报库存与分会拨购器材也不尽适用，又不加审查，便被动地签章批准一批又一批的购置。王灿文就利用我们的无计划、无预见和警惕性不高，敢于有计划地化整为零，编列预算，拖延工作，以增加设备为要挟，逐步进行他的盗窃、蒙蔽、欺骗的贪污罪行。
    三、我们对各项工作制度是否合理，是否应予补充或修订，没有深入地去考虑和研究；对已有制度是否执行，以及执行的实际情况，也没有去深入检查，因而被贪污分子王灿文钻了空子。就预算制度来说，是不够严格的，审查不认真，计划不深入，在核批预算时，没有逐项详细审查和研究，对追加和补充预算，也没有仔细查核。上月预算中的余额，下月移用，没有严格决算，重行审查，于是王灿文化整为零、逐次增补预算、套卖、蒙购的阴谋，都一一地实现了。在采购制度方面，我们对核定的程序、分层负责的界限，经购与审查的手续、有关组的联系等等，都没有很好的研究和检查，所以王灿文才有可能勾结采购员王尔烨从中捣鬼，而不被发觉。就看料、提货、验收等手续来说，制度既不详备，执行也不严格。王灿文以一人而兼办了看料、提料、押运、验收等全部手续，从而盗窃、偷换、套买，一次又一次地将大批器材，运到他家里和私设的仓库里，我们还没有发觉。这主要是我们没有主动地研究和检查，没有倾听群众的意见，以增订和改善制度。对不遵守制度的部分人员，没有启发群众及时批评纠正，致使王灿文等贪污分子利用了制度的缺点，及部分人员对制度的不重视，连续地进行贪污。
    四、更重要的是没有依靠群众，没有发扬群众的智慧，来帮助解决工作中的困难。如金刚试验所的筹建，没有把这意图和有关群众进行研究，吸取意见，充实计划，依靠群众保证完成。只凭几个经办人员的主观想像，就让王灿文独断专行，恣意跋扈，横行不法。无人敢提意见，群众积极性遭到压制，使人民事业遭到巨大损害。
    上述种种都是我们官僚主义作风的表现。如果我们能够对贪污的严重性和危害性有明确的认识，如果我们对领导工作有计划和预见，如果我们对制度能不断地研究、修订和检查，特别是我们如能实行与群众相结合的领导方法，换句话说，我们如果没有官僚主义的作风，金刚试验所应早已完工，发挥效用，对国家建设将有更多的贡献；而王灿文的贪污罪行，也可能不会发展到这样巨大，或可能很早就已破获这个案件。所以，官僚主义的确是贪污浪费的温床。今天，我们正展开着反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，这案件的沉痛教训，将教育我们和全处工作同志，使我们能在这斗争中取得胜利。（按：王灿文等贪污案的消息见本报一月六日第一版）
