Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 24th: Our front-line reporter reports: In the five days from January 16th to 20th, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, angered by a series of provocative incidents manufactured by the American aggressors to sabotage the armistice negotiations, continued to repel multiple small-scale offensives by the enemy in many places along the entire front, inflicting casualties on many enemies.

On the night before American planes once again bombed the Kaesong neutral zone—January 16th—the American aggressors again drove a company of the Rhee Syngman army's 1st Division to attack a height several kilometers northeast of Panmunjom, immediately encountering a counterattack from a unit of our army, and the enemy forces were routed after suffering more than 40 casualties.

During these five days, the fighting on the eastern front was relatively frequent. On the 17th, an American company launched an offensive against our army's positions east of Mundung-ni and was routed after suffering more than 110 casualties. On the morning of the same day, two companies of the Rhee Syngman army launched an offensive against an unnamed height east of the Bukhan River, launching seven consecutive assaults, all of which were repulsed by our army's fierce artillery fire, with enemy casualties exceeding 70.

An American squad attempted a sneak attack near the village of Yuldong southwest of Kimhwa, but was dealt a heavy blow by our army's ambushing troops. Except for two who escaped, the rest were completely annihilated.

In many places along the entire front, fierce artillery battles took place between our side and the enemy. On the 17th alone, enemy forces suffered more than 120 casualties from our army's artillery fire, and three enemy tanks and three automobiles were destroyed.

American planes continued to frantically bomb and strafe peaceful Korean residents near the front lines. On the 20th, American planes dropped 224 bombs and 24 napalm bombs in the area north of Sahoiri on the eastern front, and strafed more than 120 times. The anti-aircraft artillery units of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies fiercely struck the American air pirates.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 24th: Our reporter reports: Thanks to continuously improving their shooting skills, Chinese People's Volunteer anti-aircraft gunners are not only shooting down large numbers of American planes during the day, but are also able to shoot down enemy planes at night. A certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Volunteers stationed on a communication line in a certain area of Korea shot down four American light bombers in six nights. Another anti-aircraft artillery unit also shot down an American B26 bomber and damaged another one in one night. This is a new blow suffered by the American invading air force in Korea after being forced to reduce its daytime activities and increase its nighttime sneak attacks under the strong blows of the Chinese and Korean anti-aircraft artillery units and the People's Air Force.

    朝中部队继续击退敌军频繁进犯
    我高射炮部队在夜间经常击落美国飞机
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】本社前线记者报道：在十六日到二十日的五天中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被美国侵略者制造的一连串破坏停战谈判的挑衅事件所激怒，继续在全线的很多地方打退敌军多次小规模的进攻，并杀伤了许多敌人。
    在美国飞机又一次轰炸开城中立区的前一夜——一月十六日，美国侵略者又驱使李伪军第一师的一个连向板门店东北数公里的一个高地进攻，当即遭到我军某部的迎击，敌军被杀伤四十多人后溃退。
    在这五天中，东线的战斗比较频繁。十七日，美军一个连向文登里以东我军阵地进攻，被我军杀伤一百一十多人后溃退。同日晨，李伪军两个连向北汉江以东一个无名高地进攻，连续冲锋七次，都被我军猛烈炮火击溃，敌伤亡七十多人。
    美军一个班向金城西南栗洞附近进行偷袭，遭到我军预伏部队痛击，除逃脱二名外余被全歼。
    在全线许多地方，我敌双方进行激烈的炮战。仅十七日一天中，被我军炮火杀伤的敌军就有一百二十多人，并击毁敌军战车、汽车各三辆。
    美国飞机继续在战线附近疯狂轰炸和扫射朝鲜和平居民。二十日，美国飞机在东线沙汰里以北地区投掷炸弹二百二十四枚、汽油弹二十四枚，扫射一百二十多次。朝中人民军队的高射炮部队猛烈地打击了美国空中强盗。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】本社记者报道：中国人民志愿军高射炮手们由于不断提高射击技术，不仅在白天大量击落美机，而且也能在夜间击落敌人飞机。驻守在朝鲜某地交通线上的志愿军某高射炮部队，曾在六个晚上击落美国轻型轰炸机四架。另一支高射炮部队也在一个夜间击落美国B26型轰炸机一架，并击伤其另一架。这是美国侵朝空军在中朝高射炮部队和人民空军坚强打击下，被迫减少其白天活动增多夜间偷袭以后所遭受的新的打击。
