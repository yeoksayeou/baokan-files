    I am Determined to Correct Bureaucracy and the "Meritorious Official" Mentality
    -- Lessons Learned from Handling the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan Embezzlement Case
    Wang Zhenhai, Secretary of the CPC Dingxian District Committee, Hebei Province

    The handling of the major embezzlement case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee gave me an extremely important lesson. It heavily struck at the individualism and bureaucracy that were developing within me.

    Individualism and complacency are the subjective reasons why Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan violated laws and disciplines, and even betrayed the Party and the people. This kind of individualism and complacency is also constantly haunting me. I thought that I had been engaged in the revolutionary cause since I was young, and even if I had no merit, I still had hardship. It didn't matter if I made some mistakes. Under the control of this wrong thinking, I once approved the misappropriation of 100,000 catties of local grain for organ production. In addition, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste was rapidly developing among myself and some cadres in the special district and county-level organs, but I still thought that "rustic" and "thrifty" should be compared with serious extravagance and waste.

    In many departments of the Dingxian Special District, there are embezzlement phenomena, some of which are very serious. The occurrence of this embezzlement phenomenon is inseparable from the bureaucracy of our leadership. We rarely inspect those who steal state property for personal gain, seriously undermine Party discipline and laws, and cause extremely bad effects on the Party and the people's government among the masses; we rarely listen to the voices of the masses and deal with them; and we have not mobilized the masses to report them. As a result, many embezzlement incidents have been covered up by our bureaucratic style, and we cannot discover them in time. For problems that have been discovered, they are often delayed again and again without being dealt with, or even allowed to go unchecked. The embezzlement case of Gao Zhihua (Communist Party member), deputy dean of the Wuji County People's Court, was discovered in February last year. Although Gao Zhihua was removed from his post in May and transferred to the special district for handling in July, he has not been sanctioned by Party discipline and law until today. This proves that our bureaucratic style's tolerance of embezzlers has reached the point where the people cannot tolerate it. Therefore, we must be vigilant and resolutely fight against embezzlement and its breeding ground—bureaucracy.

    The major embezzlement case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, and the phenomenon of embezzlement and waste that already exists in our region, tell us that now is the time for the entire Party to mobilize and resolutely fight against all bourgeois ideas that have invaded the Party. If we do not immediately and resolutely and systematically carry out this struggle, we will make serious mistakes, and we will lose the Party, the country, and our lives. To this end, the Dingxian District Committee has convened a conference of all Party member cadres at the special district level, and the counties have also convened Party representative meetings to convey the policy of vigorously and vigorously launching a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. At these Party meetings, Party members in charge of work in various places and departments have made preliminary self-criticisms and are continuing to conduct in-depth self-criticisms to thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology.

    我决心纠正官僚主义和“功臣”思想
    ——从处理刘青山、张子善贪污案中所得到的教训
    中共河北省定县地委书记　王振海
    中共河北省委对于刘青山、张子善大贪污案的处理，给我上了极为重要的一课，它重重地打击了我正在发展着的个人主义和官僚主义。
    个人主义、居功自傲，是刘青山、张子善违法犯纪以至背叛党和人民的主观原因。这种个人主义、居功自傲思想也不断地在我脑子里作祟。我认为自己从小就从事革命事业，虽无功劳也有苦劳，犯点错误也不在乎。在这种错误思想支配下，我曾批准挪用地方粮十万斤搞机关生产。另外铺张浪费的现象，在我本身和专区、县级机关的部分干部中急速地发展着，但还以为“土气”、“俭朴”，要向严重的铺张浪费现象看齐。
    在定县专区不少部门中存在着贪污现象，有的是很严重的。这种贪污现象的发生，是和我们领导方面的官僚主义分不开的，我们对待那些为个人私欲而盗窃国家财产、严重地破坏党纪法纪、给党和人民政府在群众中造成极其恶劣影响的贪污分子，很少进行检查，很少听取群众的呼声而加以处理；更没有发动群众检举，以致很多的贪污事件都由于官僚主义作风遮住了我们的眼睛，不能及时发现。对已发现的问题，也往往一再拖延，不作处理，甚至听之任之。无极县人民法院副院长高志华（共产党员）的贪污案，去年二月就发现了，虽然五月间撤销了高志华的职务，七月间调来专区处理，但是直到今天还没有给以党纪和法纪的制裁。足证我们的官僚主义作风对贪污分子的纵容已到了人民不能容忍的地步。因此我们必须警惕起来，向贪污现象及其温床——官僚主义进行坚决的斗争。
    刘青山、张子善这一大贪污案，和我区已经存在着的贪污浪费的现象告诉我们：现在是全党动员向一切侵入党内的资产阶级思想进行坚决斗争的时候了，如不立即坚决地有系统地开展这一斗争，我们就会犯严重错误，就要亡党、亡国、亡身。为此，定县地委已召开专区级全体党员干部大会，各县也召开了党的代表会议，传达了大张旗鼓地雷厉风行地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的方针。在这些党的会议上，各地各部门作负责工作的党员，都作了初步检讨，并正在继续进行深入的检讨，以彻底肃清资产阶级的思想影响。
