    Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance Bureau
    Fails to Thoroughly Review Budgets, Causing Waste

    To the Editor: In early 1950, the Beijing Municipal People's Labor Bureau decided to publish a journal to facilitate business learning. At that time, the Labor Bureau submitted a budget to our bureau of 934 jin of millet for the whole year, averaging about 77 jin per month. We did not thoroughly review this budget and simply "approved" a subsidy of 500 jin per month, thinking we had reduced it by 434 jin. However, we actually mistook the "year" for the "month," and thus overpaid by 423 jin each month. From March 1950 to December 1951, a total of more than 9.8 million yuan was wasted over the course of 22 months.

    For the past two years, due to our serious bureaucratic work style, this error was not discovered until the current anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began. This fully demonstrates that we did not approach our work with a serious and responsible spirit. This is something we should deeply examine and correct.

### 北京市人民政府财政局  不详细审核预算造成浪费

    北京市人民政府财政局
    不详细审核预算造成浪费
    编辑同志：北京市人民政府劳动局在一九五○年年初，为了便于业务学习，曾决定出版一个刊物。当时劳动局向我局造报预算的数目是全年九百三十四斤小米，每月合七十七斤左右。我们对这个预算也没有详细审核，就“批准”每月补助五百斤，满以为还剔减了四百三十四斤。但实际上是把“年”当成 “月”了，因此每月就多发了四百二十三斤。从一九五○年三月起到一九五一年十二月止，在二十二个月当中，共浪费了九百八十多万元。
    两年来，由于我们在工作上有严重的官僚主义作风，以致这一错误直到这次反贪污，反浪费，反官僚主义运动展开以后才发觉。这充分说明了我们没有以认真负责的精神对待工作。这是我们应该痛切地加以检讨和纠正的。
