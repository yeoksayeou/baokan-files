Reflections on the "Resist America, Aid Korea" Film
I Will Work Hard to Support Our Most Beloved People

To the Editor: I am a primary school teacher. I watched the "Resist America, Aid Korea" documentary in Beijing and received a very profound education. After watching the true records of the Korean battlefield on film, my understanding of the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea has taken a step forward in my thinking. When I saw the Korean people being strafed by American planes, especially when I saw a Korean child crying on a pile of broken tiles because he had lost his family, I couldn't help but shed tears. Our volunteer soldiers rescued the Korean child from the fire and immediately covered him with cotton clothes. What a lofty spirit of internationalism!

Our volunteer soldiers are not afraid of any difficulties. In Korea, they climb mountains, cross rivers, dig fortifications, transport supplies, pursue and annihilate the enemy, capture the enemy, and defeat the enemy. All the weapons that the American imperialists rely on have lost their effect.

In the future, I will definitely work hard in my job, study diligently, and do a good job of educating the second generation to repay and support the People's Volunteer Army. Zhao Zenghui

Eliminating the Enemy in Thought, Building the Motherland

To the Editor: All teachers, students, and staff of our Hui Nationality College recently watched the "Resist America, Aid Korea" film.

This film is of great educational significance to us. Some students said: "Although I participated in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea in the past, I didn't do enough because I didn't have enough understanding in my mind." Some students said: "In the past, I thought that since petty-bourgeois ideology was legal, I would take the petty-bourgeois standpoint and view to look at problems and live my life. Now, after watching this film, I feel that my thoughts and behaviors are wrong, and I feel too small in front of the great volunteer soldiers. I should learn from the volunteer soldiers and take them as an example for my study and work." Many other students also examined their shortcomings in thought and life. Everyone unanimously stated: From now on, we must further strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea; eliminate the enemy in thought, study hard, exercise, and prepare to contribute everything to the construction of the motherland!

I Will Fight for the Victory of Resisting America and Aiding Korea

To the Editor: After watching the "Resist America, Aid Korea" film, I feel that our motherland is truly great.

We can see from the film that our army's humanitarian policy towards prisoners is completely correct. The prisoners of the so-called United Nations forces, who were deceived and driven by American imperialism, expressed their desire not to work for the Wall Street bosses after being educated by our army. When I saw the scenes of Korean cities and villages being destroyed by artillery fire, I hated the crimes of the invaders so much. However, we must transform hatred into strength and participate more enthusiastically in the Resist America and Aid Korea movement and fight for the victory of Resist America and Aid Korea.

I Am Ready to Wait for the Call of the Motherland at Any Time

To the Editor: After watching the "Resist America, Aid Korea" film, I received a very profound education. In the film, I saw our "most beloved people" fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army; and I personally saw the crazy behavior of American planes indiscriminately bombing peaceful Korean cities, and the suffering of innocent Korean peaceful residents being displaced and their families being separated. When I saw an old woman whose family was bombed to death and her house was burned down, leaving her alone standing blankly on the ruins, how sad I was! I clenched my fists and gritted my teeth, thinking: I can't go to the front line to eliminate the American devils right now, but I will strengthen my studies in the rear, work hard to exercise, and wait for the call of the motherland at any time, ready to go to the glorious national defense post to protect our beloved motherland and the happy life of peace-loving people all over the world.

### “抗美援朝”影片观后感

    “抗美援朝”影片观后感
    我要努力工作支援我们最可爱的人
    编辑同志：我是一个小学教员，我在北京看了“抗美援朝”纪录片，受了十分深刻的教育。我从影片上看了朝鲜战场上的真实纪录以后，对抗美援朝的伟大斗争的认识，在思想上提高了一步。当我看到朝鲜人民遭受美国飞机扫射的时候，尤其是当我看到一个朝鲜小孩因为失去了亲人，在破瓦堆上哭泣的时候，我忍不住流下了眼泪。我们志愿军从火中救出了朝鲜小孩，并立刻用棉衣替他盖上，这是多么崇高的国际主义精神！
    我们志愿军不怕一切困难，在朝鲜爬山、渡河、挖工事、运输、追歼敌人、俘掳敌人和战胜敌人；美帝国主义者所依靠的一切武器，都失去了作用。
    今后我一定在我的工作岗位上，努力钻研，认真作好教育第二代的工作，来报答和支援人民志愿军。赵增蕙肃清思想中的敌人，建设祖国
    编辑同志：我们回民学院全体师生员工，最近都看了“抗美援朝”影片。
    这部影片，对我们的教育意义很大。有的同学说：“过去我虽然参加了抗美援朝的工作，但由于思想上没有足够的认识，所以做的事情太少了。”有的同学说：“过去我认为小资产阶级思想既然是合法的，那我就拿小资产阶级的立场和观点去看问题、去生活吧。现在我看了这部片子以后，感觉自己的想法和行为是不对的，觉得站在伟大的志愿军面前是太渺小了，我应该学习志愿军，把他们作为我学习和工作的榜样。”还有许多同学都检查了自己思想上生活上的缺点，大家一致表示：从今以后，我们一定要更进一步加强抗美援朝工作；肃清思想上的敌人，好好学习，锻炼身体，准备为祖国的建设事业贡献出一切力量！
                            王文禧    李佩伦我要为争取抗美援朝胜利而斗争
    编辑同志：我看了“抗美援朝”影片，觉得我们祖国真是伟大。
    我们从影片上可以看出：我军对待俘虏的人道主义政策是完全正确的。受美帝国主义欺骗、驱策的所谓联合国军的俘虏，受到我军的教育以后，纷纷表示不再给华尔街老板们卖命。当我看到朝鲜的城市和乡村被炮火毁坏的情景时，我是这样痛恨侵略者的罪行。但是，我们要化仇恨为力量，更热烈地参加抗美援朝运动，为抗美援朝胜利而斗争。
                        人民海军战士朝尾我随时等待着祖国的号召
    编辑同志：看过“抗美援朝”影片，我受到了很深刻的教育。我在该片中看到了我们的“最可爱的人”同朝鲜人民军并肩作战的情形；并亲眼看到美国飞机滥炸朝鲜和平城市的疯狂行为，看到无辜的朝鲜和平居民流离失所、妻离子散的苦境。当我看到一位老太婆的一家人被炸死、房子被烧光，只剩她一个人呆呆地站在废墟上的时候，我是多么难过啊！我握着拳，咬紧了牙，想道：我现在不能马上上前线消灭美国鬼子，但我要在后方加强学习，努力锻炼身体，随时等待着祖国的号召，准备走上光荣的国防岗位，保卫我们可爱的祖国和全世界爱好和平的人民的幸福生活。
