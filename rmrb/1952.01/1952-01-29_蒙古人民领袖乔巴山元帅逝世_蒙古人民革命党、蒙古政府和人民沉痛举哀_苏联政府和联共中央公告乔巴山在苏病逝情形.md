Comrade Choibalsan was a close friend and comrade-in-arms of the heroic Sukhe-Bator—the founder and leader of our party and our country—and a beloved leader of our people. His death is a painful loss to our entire party and our people.

With great sorrow, we bow our heads to mourn our dear Choibalsan—a fervent revolutionary, a tireless fighter for the happiness of the working people, for peace, democracy, and socialism, and a tireless worker for the friendship of all peoples and for the friendship between our people and the Soviet Union. The glorious and brilliant fighting life of our beloved leader, Comrade Choibalsan, will be a shining example for all members of our party and the working people of our country in the struggle for socialism.
