    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 31st: At the subcommittee on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on December 31st, our side reiterated our unshakeable position of not allowing interference in internal affairs and not allowing infringement of sovereignty. Our representative sternly pointed out that whether our side carries out airport construction or not is entirely our internal affair, and no one is allowed to interfere. As long as the other side continues to insist on this unreasonable demand, it will be impossible for the meeting to make progress, and the responsibility for the resulting delay in negotiations rests entirely with the other side.
    At the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item, the other side still did not hand over the basic materials of our captured personnel, but continued to entangle themselves in the materials issue, demanding that our side further provide materials on the other side's captured personnel, and refusing to determine the principle of the rapid release and repatriation of all prisoners of war by both sides. Our representative pointed out that the exchange of materials must be carried out on the basis of equality between the two sides. The other side has no reason to once again use the materials issue as an excuse to continue to refuse to determine the principles and delay the progress of the meeting.

    美方在第四项议程小组委员会上继续拖延会议进展
    【新华社开城三十一日电】在十二月三十一日朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表重申了我方不容许干涉内政，不容许侵犯主权的不可动摇的立场。我方代表严词指出：我方进行或不进行机场的修建，完全是我方的内政问题，不容许任何人加以干涉，只要对方有一天还坚持此项无理要求，会议就一天不可能有进展，由此而产生的拖延谈判的责任完全在于对方。
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方仍未交出我方被俘人员的基本材料，却仍然在材料问题上纠缠，要求我方进一步提供对方被俘人员的材料，并拒绝确定双方迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则。我方代表指出：材料的交换必须在双方对等的基础上进行，对方没有任何理由再次以材料问题为藉口，继续拒绝确定原则，而拖延会议进展。
