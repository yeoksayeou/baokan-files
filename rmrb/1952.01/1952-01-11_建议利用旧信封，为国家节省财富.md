    Suggesting the Use of Old Envelopes to Save Wealth for the Nation
    Comrade Editor: Since Chairman Mao issued the call at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to "increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," I have been considering how I myself should respond to this great call. I am a correspondent for the Henan Dazhong Daily, and my daily work involves reading manuscripts and writing letters. In the course of my work, I have seen that many envelopes can be turned over and reused. Therefore, from December 29th of last year to January 2nd of this year, I selected fifteen good envelopes from the twenty-six envelopes of readers' letters and reused them. In this way, an average of three envelopes can be saved every day; if calculated on an annual basis, one thousand and ninety-five envelopes can be saved; with each envelope valued at 150 yuan, this would save the country 164,250 yuan. Although the amount I save alone seems very small, if all two thousand five hundred comrades who work on correspondence or readers' letters for the four hundred and fifty newspapers across the country were to do the same, it would save the country more than 400 million yuan in a year. It can be seen that this number is not small. Therefore, in addition to continuing to use reusable envelopes, saving stationery, and improving work efficiency, I also suggest that comrades across the country who work on correspondence or readers' letters for all newspapers should make the most of old envelopes or use other effective methods to save wealth for the country and support "our most beloved people"!

    建议利用旧信封，为国家节省财富
    编辑同志：自从毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上提出“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召后，我就考虑我自己应该怎样来响应这一伟大的号召。我是河南大众报的通联工作者，每天的工作就是看稿写信。在工作过程中，看到有很多信封是可以翻过来使用的。所以，我从去年十二月二十九日到今年一月二日止，就从二十六件读者来信的信封中，挑选了十五个好的信封翻过来使用。这样，平均每天就可以节省三个信封；如以一年来计算，就可以节省一千零九十五个；每个信封以价值一百五十元计，就为国家节省了十六万四千二百五十元。我一人节省的数字看起来虽然很小，但全国四百五十种报纸，如有二千五百个作通联或读者来信工作的同志，也都这样作，一年内就可以给国家节约四亿多元。可见这个数字是不小的。因此，我除了继续使用能翻用的信封，节省信纸，提高工作效率外，并建议全国各报作通联或读者来信的同志，要尽量利用旧信封，或用其它各种有效办法，来为国家节省财富，支持
    “我们最可爱的人”！　王秉亭
