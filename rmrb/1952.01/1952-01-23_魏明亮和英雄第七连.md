    Wei Mingliang and the Heroic Seventh Company
    Wei Mingliang is an outstanding battalion political instructor of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The Seventh Company under his command created a brilliant record of defeating the enemy with fewer soldiers and killing or wounding more than 640 enemy soldiers in the Battle of Ma Liang Mountain during the "Autumn Offensive" launched by the enemy.
    On the morning of October 5th last year, the enemy, with a battalion of troops, under the cover of more than a dozen artillery groups, four aircraft, and five tanks, attacked the main barrier of Ma Liang Mountain, the 216.8 Height, in several directions. The warriors of the Seventh Company defending this position fought back bravely, repelling five enemy attacks on the first day and killing or wounding more than 200 enemy soldiers.
    The next day, the Seventh Company faced an unprecedentedly fierce battle. The enemy troops increased to two battalions, first concentrating all their artillery fire for a full five hours. Although tons of steel flattened the Seventh Company's position, they could not destroy the warriors' determination. Enraged, the enemy launched continuous charges relying on artillery fire. At this time, the company headquarters put forward a resounding slogan: "Annihilate the enemy on the front line of the position." The soldiers shouted in unison: "Resolutely hold the position and perform meritorious service for the people of the world." Under the direct command of Company Commander Yan Zhigang, everyone fought repeatedly with the enemy. When the enemy was dense, they threw grenades; when the enemy was dispersed, they used submachine guns to sweep them. The enemy charged up and was beaten back again. The soldiers pursued the enemy with intersecting fire, and the enemy fell in droves. In this way, the Seventh Company repelled 17 enemy attacks, and the position of the heroic 216.8 Height stood still. The Seventh Company was awarded the honorary title of "Heroic Company."

    魏明亮和英雄第七连
    魏明亮是中国人民志愿军某部出色的营教导员。受他指挥的第七连，在粉碎敌人“秋季攻势”的马良山战斗中，创造了以少胜多、毙伤敌人六百四十余名的辉煌战绩。
    去年十月五日晨，敌人以一个营的兵力，在十几个炮群、四架飞机、五辆坦克的掩护下，分数路向马良山的主要屏障二一六·八高地进犯，守卫这一阵地的七连勇士们，英勇反击，第一天打退了敌人五次进攻，杀伤了敌人二百余名。
    次日，第七连面临着一场空前激烈的战斗。敌军增加到两个营，首先集中全部炮火轰击了整整五个钟头。成吨的钢铁虽然摧平了七连的阵地，但是摧不毁勇士们的决心。恼羞成怒的敌人，凭借着炮火，连续发起了冲锋。这时，连部提出一个响亮的口号：“要把敌人消灭在阵地前沿。”战士们群起高呼：“坚决守住阵地，为世界人民立功。”大家在连长阎志刚的直接指挥下，和敌人反复冲杀，敌人密集，便投掷手榴弹；敌人疏散，便用冲锋枪扫射。敌人冲上来，又被打下去。战士们用交叉的火力追击着敌人，敌人倒下一片又一片。第七连就这样打退了敌人的十七次进攻，英雄的二一六·八高地的阵地屹立未动。第七连被赠予“英雄连”的光荣称号。（附图片）
