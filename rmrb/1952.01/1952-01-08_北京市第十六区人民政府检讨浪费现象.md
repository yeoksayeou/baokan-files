    The People's Government of the Sixteenth District of Beijing Conducts Self-Criticism on Wasteful Practices
    To the Editors: After reading reader Niu Hu's criticism in the People's Daily on December 15, 1951, regarding "Wasteful Practices by the People's Government of the Sixteenth District of Beijing," we have conducted a self-criticism.
    Regarding the automobile: Although it was purchased after requesting instructions from higher authorities, and although after the shutdown of the organ's production, we were unable to repair the cylinder when it broke in the spring of 1951, and later even put wooden planks under the tires, a strict inspection reveals that we did not do enough in terms of care and maintenance. Regarding the toilet, although it was uniformly regulated by the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau, and its design, construction, repair, and expenses were directly handled by the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau, our poor management, insufficient supervision, and inadequate inspection resulted in it being very dirty and having a strong odor, which displeased the surrounding residents. We have made a special self-criticism at the People's Representative Conference of all circles in the district.
    We thank Comrade Niu Hu for his criticism of us.
                    The People's Government of the Sixteenth District of Beijing

    北京市第十六区人民政府检讨浪费现象
    编辑同志：看到一九五一年十二月十五日人民日报读者牛虎对“北京市第十六区人民政府有浪费现象”的批评，我们已经作了检讨。
    关于小汽车：虽然是请示上级后购买的，虽然由于机关生产停办后，一九五一年春坏了汽缸就无力重修，后来又在轮带下边垫上了木板等，但是严格检查起来，在爱护和保管上是作得不够的。关于厕所，虽然是由市卫生工程局统一规定，它的设计、承做、检修、开支等也是由市卫生工程局直接办理，但是，因为我们管理不好，督促、检查不够，弄得很肮脏，臭味很大，使周围住户不满。我们已在区各界人民代表会上特别作过检讨。
    我们感谢牛虎同志对我们的批评。
                    北京市第十六区人民政府
