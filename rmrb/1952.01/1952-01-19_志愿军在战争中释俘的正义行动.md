    The just action of the Chinese People's Volunteers in releasing prisoners of war during the war is not only known to the people of the world and the American people, but even unanimously recognized by the soldiers of the invading army on the Korean battlefield. However, the shameless American aggressors are obliterating this fact at the negotiating table of the Korean armistice talks, refusing to accept the principle of the Korean-Chinese side's complete release and repatriation of prisoners of war, and endlessly delaying the armistice talks. Prisoners of war from the United States, Britain, and other countries in the POW camps in North Korea are very angry at this despicable behavior of the American aggressors. They use the facts they have witnessed to expose the shameless behavior of the US side in obliterating the facts.

    Since the beginning of the war, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies have often released prisoners of war in large numbers. James Bales, a soldier in B Company, 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division of the US Army, said: "Every soldier has seen the Volunteers release prisoners of war during the war. In November 1950, we were on the road in front of the Volunteers' front. Next to us, we found twenty-eight wounded American officers and soldiers lying there, their wounds already bandaged. They told us that they had just been released by the Volunteers. One of the captains with a leg injury also said that after they were captured, the Volunteers took them to the mountain villages behind the front line, bandaged their wounds, and gave them food and tobacco. Later, the twenty-eight of them were released. A soldier with a broken right arm also said that the Volunteer doctors operated on him, removed shrapnel and bone fragments, and even gave him a blood transfusion because he had lost too much blood. They were all grateful for the humane treatment of the Volunteers."

    Richard Goldriuski, a soldier in L Company, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division of the US Army, said: "On January 29th of last year, sixteen American prisoners of war were released by the Volunteers in front of our position. These soldiers were all captured on January 15th. One of them was a soldier from K Company in the same regiment as me. He told me that his right leg was injured and he could not move. The Volunteer doctors bandaged him and assigned other prisoners of war to carry him back, and ordered that he not be abandoned."

    In contrast to the Volunteers' lenient treatment of prisoners of war, the American aggressors are very afraid of these prisoners of war being released. They fear that these prisoners of war will tell the truth about the Korean and Chinese troops' humanitarian treatment of prisoners of war. They try their best to prevent soldiers, reporters, and outsiders from approaching and talking to these prisoners of war, or send these prisoners of war to other places to isolate them. Maurice Field, a US prisoner of war, said: "In March of last year, in a place more than ten miles west of Seoul, we were marching when we found eight American wounded soldiers sitting in the cave next to the road. They told us that they had just been released by the Volunteers and asked us to send them to the rear. Our officers did not allow us to talk to them, and immediately sent them to the camp headquarters."

    Manuel Keselwitz, a soldier in C Company, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division of the US Army, said: "Around May and June of last year, near the 38th parallel, the Volunteers released a soldier who used to be in the same company as me. This soldier told us that the Volunteers were all good people, and he would never fight these good people again. Later, his conversation was known to the officers, and they immediately sent him away."

    The just action of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies in treating prisoners of war leniently cannot be distorted. The shameless behavior of the American aggressors in deceiving the people of the world with rumors cannot stand at all in the face of eloquent facts.

    志愿军在战争中释俘的正义行动
    新华社记者　王殊
    中国人民志愿军在战争中释放战俘的正义行动，不仅全世界人民和美国人民都知道，甚至在朝鲜战场上的侵略军士兵也一致公认。但是，无耻的美国侵略者，却在朝鲜停战谈判的会议桌上抹杀这一事实，拒绝接受朝中方面全部释放与遣送战俘的原则，无休止地拖延停战谈判。朝鲜北部俘虏营中的美英等国战俘对美国侵略者这种卑鄙的行为，都表示非常愤怒。他们以自己所目睹的事实，揭发美方抹杀事实的无耻行为。
    朝、中人民军队从战争开始以来，就经常大批释放战俘。美俘第二十五步兵师第三十五步兵团B连士兵詹姆斯·贝尔斯说：“志愿军在战争中释放俘虏是我们每个士兵都看见的。在一九五○年十一月间，我们在志愿军阵线前面的公路旁边，发现有二十八个负了伤的美军官兵躺在那里，他们的伤口都已被包扎好。他们告诉我们说，他们是才被志愿军释放回来的。其中有一个腿部负伤的上尉还说，他们被俘后，志愿军就把他们带到战线后方的山村中，替他们包扎伤口，给他们食物和烟草。以后，他们二十八个人就被释放回来了。有一个右臂折断的士兵还说，志愿军的医生给他开过刀，取出弹片和碎骨，由于他流血过多，还给他输了血。他们都感激志愿军人道的宽待。”
    美俘第二步兵师第三十八步兵团L连士兵瑞却德·戈德留斯吉说：“去年一月二十九日在我们阵地前面，有十六个美国战俘被志愿军释放回来。这些士兵都是在一月十五日被俘的。其中有一个是与我同一个团K连的士兵，他告诉我说，他右腿负了伤不能行动，志愿军医生替他包扎后还指定其他战俘抬他回来，并且吩咐不准把他丢掉。”
    与志愿军宽待俘虏相反，美国侵略者非常害怕这些俘虏被释放回来。他们惧怕这些俘虏会说出朝中部队人道主义宽待俘虏的真相。他们尽量设法不使士兵、记者和外界人士与这些俘虏接近和谈话，或者把这些俘虏遣送到别的地方去隔离起来。美俘毛利斯·费尔德说：“去年三月间在汉城西十余里的一个地方，我们正行军中，发现在公路旁边的地洞里坐着八个美国伤兵。他们告诉我们说，他们是刚被志愿军放回来的，请求我们送他们到后方去。我们的长官不准我们和他们谈话，并且立刻把他们送到营部去。”
    美俘第二步兵师第三十八步兵团C连士兵曼纽尔·凯斯尔维兹说：“去年五、六月间，在三八线附近志愿军放回了一个从前和我同一个连队的士兵，这个士兵告诉我们说，志愿军都是好人，他再也不跟这些好人打仗了。后来他的谈话给长官知道了，就立刻把他送走了。”
    朝、中人民军队宽待战俘的正义行动，是歪曲不了的。美国侵略者用谣言蒙蔽天下人耳目的无耻行为，在雄辩的事实面前，就完全站不住脚。
