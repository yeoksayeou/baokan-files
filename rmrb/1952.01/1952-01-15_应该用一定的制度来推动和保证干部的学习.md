    Certain Systems Should Be Used to Promote and Guarantee Cadre Study

    Comrade Editor: Establishing various practical systems is a good method for promoting and guaranteeing on-the-job cadres' theoretical study. The experience of Tianjin's state-owned enterprises in cadre study in 1951 powerfully proves this point. For example, the Tianjin Office of the Steel Industry Bureau established six study systems: planned, inspected, discussed, tested, summarized, and criticized/commended. These systems greatly promoted cadre study. Some cadres often studied on their own until 11:00 PM, and more than 95% of the cadres took study notes. The learning mutual aid group established by the South Branch of the Central Electrical Equipment Factory also played a significant role in learning. The Jiang Furui group of this factory mobilized comrades with higher levels of proficiency within the group to help comrades with lower levels of proficiency write speaking outlines, which greatly increased the entire group's enthusiasm for learning. After the Bicycle Factory established a system for formulating learning covenants, the study attendance rate increased from about 65% to 92%, and the phenomenon of tardiness and early departure was gradually eliminated.

    应该用一定的制度来推动和保证干部的学习
    编辑同志：建立各种切合实际的制度，是推动和保证在职干部理论学习的好方法。天津市国营企业一九五一年干部学习的经验，有力地证明了这一点。例如，钢铁工业局天津事务所建立了六种学习制度：有计划、有检查、有讨论、有测验、有总结、有批评表扬。这些制度大大地推动了干部的学习。有些干部经常自学到深夜十一时，百分之九十五以上的干部都作了学习笔记。中央电工器材厂南分厂建立的学习互助小组，也对学习起了很大的作用。这个厂姜福瑞小组发动组内程度较高的同志帮助程度较低的同志写作发言提纲，就使全组学习热情大为提高。自行车厂在建立了制订学习公约的制度后，学习出勤率就从百分之六十五左右上升到百分之九十二，并逐渐消灭了迟到和早退的现象。
