    One Envelope Can Be Used Four Times
    Comrade Editor: I work as a mail clerk in the General Office of the Subei Huai River Harnessing Headquarters. After studying the documents on "Increasing Production and Practicing Economy," I understood that increasing production and practicing economy can not only strengthen the effort to resist America and aid Korea, but also is the source of important economic strength for strengthening the country’s various constructions. Therefore, "increasing production and practicing economy" is the responsibility of everyone. But in the past, I thought that I was restricted by the nature of my work and could not increase production and practice economy. Now I realize that this idea is completely wrong. In the middle of last month, I found a letter sent from outside, which used a flipped envelope. That is to say, after the envelope is used, it can still be used by flipping it over. Flipping the envelope over and reusing it does not take much time, but it does the same thing. Only then did I suddenly realize that any type of work, as long as you use your brain and think of more ways, can increase production and practice economy. I studied it and found that an envelope can be reused at least four times. If the whole country does this, then for envelopes alone, the country can save three-quarters of the original consumption. I hope that comrades in all work posts can use their brains and think of more ways to increase production and practice economy.　Zhang Lixian

    一个信封可以用四次
    编辑同志：我在苏北治淮总指挥部办公厅担任收发工作。我学习了关于“增产节约”的文件后，了解到增产节约不只可以增强抗美援朝力量，而且是加强祖国各项建设的重要经济力量的泉源。因此，“增产节约”是人人有责的。但我过去认为自己受工作性质的限制，无法增产节约，现在我已认识到这种想法是完全错误的。上月中旬，我发现外边寄来的一封信件，用的是翻信封。这就是说，信封用过以后，翻过来仍然能用。信封翻过来再用，费时不多，办的事情却一样。我这才恍然大悟，任何性质的工作，只要开动脑筋，多想办法，都能增产节约。我研究了一下，发现一个信封反复再用，至少可用四次。如果全国都这样做，那末，单信封一项，全国就可节省原消耗量的四分之三。我希望各个工作岗位上的同志们都能开动脑筋，多想出增产节约的办法来。　张立贤
