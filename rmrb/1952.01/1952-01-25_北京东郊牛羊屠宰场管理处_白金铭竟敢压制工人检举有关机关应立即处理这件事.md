    To the Editor: Bai Jinming, a leading cadre of the Beijing Eastern Suburbs Cattle and Sheep Slaughterhouse Management Office, is suppressing workers who are reporting his corrupt behavior during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. Bai Jinming's behavior is usually bad; he often uses his authority to ask meat merchants for meat, ranging from a few pounds to dozens of pounds. When the anti-corruption campaign began, he said to the union cadres in the slaughterhouse: "I paid for the meat I got from private merchants, so it's not corruption. You should think carefully when you make suggestions." When he learned that the slaughterhouse workers had reported his relationship with the merchants to our office, he said to the union chairman and others: "The workers have made more than thirty suggestions about me. I must find out who made the suggestions and deal with him properly." On January 14th, he ordered workers Hei Yu, Ma Delu, and others to investigate and pursue those who made suggestions. Because he repeatedly investigated the informants, no one dared to make any more suggestions. The workers said, "Don't make any suggestions; you'll be investigated if you do." We suggest that the relevant departments immediately handle this matter and remove this obstacle so that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign can be carried out effectively.

    白金铭竟敢压制工人检举有关机关应立即处理这件事
    编辑同志：北京东郊牛羊屠宰场管理处领导干部白金铭，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，压制检举他贪污行为的工人。白金铭平时作风不好，经常利用职权，向肉商要肉，少则几斤，多则几十斤。在开始进行反贪污时，他对场里工会干部说：“我要私商的肉都给了钱，不算什么贪污，你们提意见时要好好考虑。”当他知道屠宰场工人向我们办事处报告了他和商人间的关系后，就对工会主席等人说：“工人给我提了三十多条意见，我非把提意见的人追出来好好搞他一下不可。”一月十四日，他又命令工人黑玉、马得禄等调查、追究提意见的人。由于他一再追查检举人，就没有人再提意见了。工人们说：“别提意见了，提了被追查。”我们建议有关部门立刻处理这件事，搬掉这块石头，以便把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动很好地开展起来。　　北京市总工会第十区办事处通讯组
