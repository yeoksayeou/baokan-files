    Decision of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on Expelling Yi Jiguang from the Party
    (Approved by the Wuhan Municipal Committee and approved by the Central South Bureau)
    Yi Jiguang is currently the Deputy Mayor of Wuhan Municipality, and formerly served as the Secretary-General and Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government. He joined the Party in 1926. He is currently a member of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee. During his more than 20 years of revolutionary work, Yi Jiguang worked hard in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, was imprisoned, and made contributions to the people. However, for more than two years, during his work in Wuhan, he could not withstand the ideological erosion of the bourgeoisie, degenerated and deteriorated, and completely lost his revolutionary spirit by befriending the enemy. The Municipal Party Committee decided to expel him from the Party.
    During Yi Jiguang's work in the Civil Affairs Bureau, he did not deal with the hidden counter-revolutionary elements and suspected elements in the bureau, even though there was material available. Instead, he adopted an attitude of trust, promotion, care, and protection. Some were promoted to be the secretary of the Production and Education Institute and the secretary-general of the Relief Branch; some were assigned to be responsible for the United Association of Charity Halls; some were in charge of keeping the overall archives of the bureau; some should have been under control (due to serious illness, it was not implemented), but the government continued to provide for their lives as usual, and prepared to introduce them to work in the municipal government. Liu, the daughter of the former mayor of Changsha under the puppet regime, committed suicide by jumping into the river due to a love affair, but Yi took her in to live in the Civil Affairs Bureau, and ordered cadres to accompany her to see a doctor and dance, while not taking care of the family members of soldiers who jumped into the river. Although he knew that the counter-revolutionary element Jiang Ming (now sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve) had committed numerous blood debts, he arbitrarily promoted him to acting chief of the Civil Affairs Section (formerly a member of the Civil Affairs Bureau) and secretary-general of the Relief Branch, and sent him to Shanghai to participate in the national relief and welfare conference convened by the Central Government. Although the public security organs and cadres in the bureau had raised objections to Jiang's appointment, they were all rejected. He actively helped another counter-revolutionary element (who had been arrested and detained during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries) to marry a section chief in the bureau. When comrades raised objections, Yi replied, "The world now belongs to us, what are we afraid of?" More seriously, regarding the attitude towards the father of a female doctor surnamed Wu, Wu's father was originally a counter-revolutionary element under control, but Yi Jiguang shielded him because of his ambiguous relationship with the female doctor surnamed Wu, and ordered the Public Security Bureau to lift the control on the pretext of his old age and to take care of him. After the masses reported again secretly, the father of the female doctor surnamed Wu committed suicide for fear of punishment after the control was restored. Yi Jiguang immediately sent two cadres to handle the funeral, ordered the funeral home to provide completely free service, and forced the coffin merchant to sell the coffin at 70% of the cost price. Yi Jiguang personally attended the funeral and sent a public car to transport the coffin to Shekou, Huangpi County for burial, and sent 300,000 yuan as funeral expenses. In order to win the favor of the female doctor surnamed Wu, Yi Jiguang personally drafted a lease for her, with very harsh conditions. Her family then declared: "This was written by the Secretary-General of the People's Government."
    Because Yi Jiguang blurred the line between the enemy and ourselves ideologically, he made serious mistakes in implementing various social policies that deviated from the masses and violated the Party's policies.
    When reorganizing various charity halls and guilds in Wuhan, Yi Jiguang did not proceed from the Party's policies and in order to strengthen political leadership, but simply from an economic point of view. Therefore, he adopted the wrong method of "not moving high rents and increasing low rents" for rent adjustments, which aroused extreme dissatisfaction among the housing masses, who organized "chamber pot teams," "petition groups," and "anti-rent teams" to protest. Due to the adoption of methods of merging and dismissing teachers for the schools affiliated to the United Association of Charity Halls and Guilds, teachers lost their jobs, a large number of students dropped out of school, and employee salaries were generally reduced, so that teachers and staff members distributed leaflets expressing extreme dissatisfaction with the government. Yi Jiguang did not attach importance to this situation, but instead said domineeringly: "It is necessary to strictly stop the bad phenomenon of charity hooligans and rascals writing letters everywhere." He tore up the relevant opinions of the masses and also told the cadres: "Don't be afraid, the sky won't fall, I'll take care of any lawsuits." Yi Jiguang not only adopted this domineering and bullying attitude towards the masses, but also had disagreements with the Bureau of Culture and Education and the Trade Union of Educational Workers because of this matter, forming a confrontation that was not resolved for a long time. It also affected the delay in paying nearly 900 million in taxes for nearly a year. In addition, Yi Jiguang extracted more than 29 million yuan from the social relief funds to open the Rongyou Rice Mill for personal enjoyment and miscellaneous expenses of the agency to satisfy personal desires. In order to satisfy purely profitable behavior, he blindly and arbitrarily transferred more than 200 million yuan of funds from charity halls and guilds to "strive" for the relocation of the Qinfeng Yarn Factory in Shanghai. Due to miscalculation in advance, more than 2,000 spindles are still piled up in warehouses, and 82 workers have not been put into production but are still paid wages, resulting in a major loss of more than 2 billion yuan and affecting the economic turnover of the United Association of Charity Halls and Guilds and the development of social relief undertakings.
    Yi Jiguang adopted the leadership style of unprincipled promotion and appointment and serious bureaucracy in cadre policy and leadership style. He suppressed democracy, suppressed criticism, and used emotional wooing on certain cadres. For those who were obedient and flattering, he promoted, trusted, accommodated, and took care of them. For comrades who frequently raised opinions and had opinions, he attacked, excluded, and suppressed them. The cadres under his leadership had raised many opinions and organized heart-to-heart talks to put them forward to him face to face. Yi Jiguang believed that this was "intentional revenge, impure motives, bad people taking advantage of loopholes, and undermining leadership prestige." He falsely accused this of being "liberalism, egalitarianism, and extreme democracy." He also rebuked those who raised opinions as "stirring up trouble and fearing that the world is not in chaos." He even openly declared, "I am managing you as the director, secretary of the general branch, and cadre of the Party group, don't be naughty, be careful of your Party membership."
    Yi Jiguang's erroneous thinking is manifested in his life as pursuing personal enjoyment, abusing public funds, and living a corrupt life. He believed that as a leader, he should be special, and felt that the material treatment he should have received according to the system was insufficient, and demanded special care from the public. Therefore, he used his power to abuse more than 22 million yuan of public funds in the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Production and Education Institute, the Relief Branch, and the municipal government, completely for personal enjoyment and special care for his family. He said to the cadres of the municipal government's affairs work: "The lives of the mayor and deputy mayor are not as good as those of the director, you should take good care of them!" He was not ashamed of this kind of personal enjoyment and corruption, but thought it was a matter of course.
    Judging from the above mistakes, Yi Jiguang has completely lost the conditions of being a member of the Communist Party of China. Due to the guidance of his erroneous thinking, the prestige of the Party and the government among the people has been seriously damaged in the work of more than two years. The Wuhan Municipal Party Committee believes that Yi Jiguang's mistakes are a serious betrayal of the interests of the Party and the people. Therefore, no matter what his past achievements are, he must be expelled from the Party and it is recommended that the government punish him according to law. (The municipal party committee will conduct a separate review of the bureaucratic mistakes it committed in this matter.)

    中国共产党武汉市委员会关于开除易吉光党籍的决定
    （武汉市委员会通过并经中南局批准）
    易吉光现任武汉市人民政府副市长、前曾任武汉市人民政府秘书长、民政局局长等职。于一九二六年入党。现为武汉市委委员。在二十多年的革命工作中，易吉光曾在国民党统治区进行过艰苦的工作，坐过监狱，对人民有过功绩。但两年多来，在武汉市工作期间经受不住资产阶级的思想侵蚀，堕落蜕化，以致与敌为友，完全丧失了革命气质，市委决定开除其党籍。
    易吉光在民政局工作期间，对局内潜藏的反革命分子及嫌疑分子，虽已有材料，但不作处理，仍采取信任、提拔、照顾、包庇的态度。有的提拔为生产教养院的秘书主任、救济分会的秘书长；有的分配在善堂联合会负责；有的在局内保管全局档案；有的应被管制（因病重未实施），但生活上仍由政府照常供给，并准备介绍参加市府工作；原伪长沙市长之女刘某因失恋投江自杀未遂，被易收留在民政局居住，并命令干部陪同看病、跳舞，而对军属投江者则不加照顾。反革命分子蒋铭（现已判处死刑缓期二年执行），虽知其血债累累，但擅自提为代理民政科科长（原为民政局参议）及救济分会秘书长，并派往上海参加中央召开的全国救济福利会议。公安机关及局内干部虽曾提出反对任用蒋的意见，但均被拒绝。对另一反革命分子（在镇压反革命运动时已捕押）则积极帮助其和局内一个科长结婚，当同志们提出反对意见时，易则答复说：“现在的天下是我们的，怕什么？”更严重的是对吴姓女医生的父亲的态度，吴父原为被管制的反革命分子，因易吉光和吴姓女医生关系暧昧，因而进行包庇，以其年老为藉口，令公安局解除管制，加以照顾。后经群众再次密告，吴姓女医生之父在恢复管制后畏罪自缢，而易吉光即派两个干部为其治丧，令殡仪馆完全免费，强令棺木商按成本七折售与棺木。易吉光并亲自送葬，派公家汽车送棺柩至黄陂县滠口葬埋，又送三十万元作为治丧费。为求取吴姓女医生的好感，易吉光曾亲自代其起草房租租约，条件甚为苛刻。其家人则扬言：“这是人民政府秘书长写的。”
    易吉光由于在思想上模糊了敌我界限，因而在执行各种社会政策上就产生了严重的脱离群众违反党的政策的错误。
    在整理武汉市各个善堂及会馆时，易吉光不是从党的政策和为着加强政治领导出发，而是单纯从经济观点出发。于是对房租的调整采取了“高租不动，低租增加”的错误办法，激起了住房群众的极端不满，相率组织“马桶队”、“请愿团”、“抗租队”表示抗议。对善堂会馆联合会所属学校则因采取合并及撤销教员的办法，造成教员失业，大批学生失学，员工薪金普遍降低，以致教职员工散发传单，对政府表示极为不满。而易吉光对此种情况并不重视，反而蛮横地说：“必须严加制止善棍会痞状子满天飞的恶劣现象。”并将群众的有关意见书撕毁，还对干部扬言：“不要怕，天塌不下来，打官司有我。”易吉光不但对群众采取这种蛮横的恶霸态度，并因此事曾和文教局、教育工作者工会闹意见，形成对立，久不解决，还影响近九亿的税款拖延将近一年才缴纳。另外，易吉光从社会救济事业费开办的荣优米厂提取二千九百多万元，做为个人享受及机关杂项开支之用，以满足个人生活的欲望。又为着满足单纯营利行为而盲目地擅自将善堂会馆款二亿余元去“争取”上海琴丰纱厂内迁。因事先估计错误，至今二千余纱锭仍堆集栈房，八十二个工人未进行生产而照发工薪，致造成二十余亿元的重大损失，并影响善堂会馆联合会的经济周转和社会救济事业的发展。
    易吉光在干部政策和领导作风上采取了无原则的提拔任用和严重的官僚主义作风。他压制民主，打击批评，并对某些干部施以感情拉拢。对于顺从逢迎者，则提拔、信任、迁就、照顾。对于经常提意见和有意见的同志则打击、排挤、压制。在他领导下的干部，曾提出不少意见，并曾组织谈心会正面向其提出。易吉光则认为这是“有意报复，动机不纯，坏人钻空子，破坏领导威信”。诬此为“自由主义、平均主义、极端民主”。并斥责提意见者是“兴风作浪，唯恐天下不乱”。甚至公开声称“我以局长、总支书记、党组干事的身份来管你们，不要调皮，小心党籍。”
    易吉光的错误思想表现在生活上是贪图个人享受、滥用公款、生活腐化，以为自己是领导者应当特殊，对于按制度应得的物质待遇感到不足，要求公家给以特殊照顾。于是利用职权，在民政局、生产教养院、救济分会及市政府四个单位滥用公款二千二百余万元，完全作为个人享受和对自己家庭特殊照顾之用。对市府的事务工作干部说：“市长副市长的生活还不如局长哩，你们应该好好照顾呀！”对这种个人生活上的享受腐化思想不以为耻，反以为当然。
    从上述这些错误看来，易吉光已完全丧失了作为中国共产党党员的条件。并由于其错误思想的指导，在两年多的工作中使党和政府在人民群众中的威信已受到严重的损失。武汉市委认为易吉光的错误是严重地背叛了党的和人民的利益。故不管其过去的功绩如何，亦必须开除其党籍并建议政府依法惩处。（市委对此问题所犯之官僚主义错误另行检讨）
