Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th - Since our side put forward a revised plan on January 9th in the subcommittee of the third item on the Korean Armistice Negotiation agenda, agreeing within a reasonable scope to the other side's necessary replacement of military equipment during the armistice, for six days the other side has continued to repeat various excuses, insisting on restricting our side's right to dispose of airport equipment within Korea, attempting to interfere in our internal affairs. For six days, our representatives have exhaustively refuted the other side's self-contradictory and absurd arguments that our domestic airport equipment threatens the other side's safety, and that the other side should still retain the right to indiscriminate bombing after the armistice to obstruct our domestic equipment. On January 15, the other side put forward the absurd theory of maintaining military balance and maintaining the status quo of the war. Our representative solemnly pointed out: "Since the beginning of the negotiations, our side has put forward a plan to withdraw all foreign troops and use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, based on our consistent position of thoroughly and peacefully resolving the Korean issue. Our proposition is to thoroughly and peacefully resolve the Korean issue with foresight and step by step, and to completely extinguish the flames of war in Korea. Your side, on the contrary, attempts to continue the war in Korea, and attempts to continue to maintain a long-term state of war in Korea after the armistice, in order to create a tense situation in the world and realize your war policy. Your side not only opposes our fair and peace-loving proposals, but also deliberately slanders our peace proposals to cover up your intention to implement a war policy. The discussion of the third agenda item more fully exposes your intention. Precisely because your side attempts to maintain a long-term state of war in Korea, your side has put forward unrestricted entry of military personnel and weapons and ammunition from outside Korea for rotation and replenishment, and the requirement that your personnel be allowed to inspect freely in our rear. In order to first satisfy the preliminary peaceful desire of all peace-loving people in the world to achieve an armistice in Korea, our side has also suggested that during the armistice, neither side should enter any reinforcing military forces from outside Korea, including combat aircraft, and that neutral countries should conduct inspections. When either party to the Military Armistice Commission requests an investigation into incidents violating the armistice agreement, the neutral country's supervisory agency should conduct the investigation. In this way, our side has provided a complete and sufficient, fair and reasonable plan to ensure the stability of the armistice. If your side, like our side, is willing to make the same guarantee and actually abide by this guarantee, it is impossible to imagine that either side will massively increase its military strength in Korea during the armistice. However, your side still insists on interfering in our internal affairs under the pretext of restricting airports in Korea. Your side cannot but understand that not allowing interference in our internal affairs is our firm and unshakable position. The issue of carrying out or not carrying out any equipment in our territory is entirely a matter of internal affairs, and your side is not allowed to interfere, let alone bargain at the negotiation meeting. Our plan of January 9th has already put forward a sufficient, complete, and reasonable way to resolve the differences between the two sides in the third agenda item. The progress of the meeting completely depends on your side abandoning the unreasonable demand to interfere in our internal affairs." In the subcommittee of the fourth agenda item, our representative first raised to the other side that at 21:00 on the 14th, our Jiangdong No. 8 POW camp was bombed by the other side's aircraft, killing more than ten captured personnel of the other side and injuring more than sixty people, and requested the other side to pay serious attention. Our representative also listed the contradictions in the other side's speeches and proposals and raised questions to the other side. The first article of the other side's proposal stated that all prisoners of war should be released, but other articles stipulated that the release should be conditional on "oaths," the repatriation should be conditional on "one-to-one," and the so-called "voluntary" conditions. Obviously, it was an attempt to detain our captured personnel and send them to the Chiang and Li bandit gangs. How can that be considered a complete release? The other side claimed to agree with our side's proposal to assist all displaced civilians to return to their homes. Why did they violate the clear provisions of the agenda in the proposal, mixing civilians who did not participate in the war with prisoners of war, and demanding that civilians and prisoners of war be traded on a "one-to-one" basis? What is the reason for using our captured soldiers as hostages? The other side also claimed that the other side's proposal was beneficial to both sides. If our side also demanded that the other side release and repatriate all our personnel, but our side only repatriated a part of the other side's personnel, and demanded that the other side exchange civilians for the remaining prisoners of war of the other side, would the other side agree? The other side repeatedly claimed that the materials on the whereabouts of the 1,456 people who will be handed over soon and the 44,205 people of our side have not yet been handed over. The other side repeatedly avoided answering our questions, claiming that they would provide an answer tomorrow, but also saying that tomorrow's answer might not be better than today's answer. Our representative pointed out that only by truly abiding by the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice and abandoning the conspiracy to detain our captured personnel as hostages can the other side free themselves from contradictory statements.

    我方代表继续驳斥美方荒谬论点
    美机十四日轰炸我方江东第八俘虏营我方在谈判会上警告美方应严重注意
    【新华社开城十五日电】自从一月九日我方在朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上提出了修正方案，在合理范围内同意对方在停战期间进行必要的军事装备的替换后，六天以来，对方仍然重复各种藉口，坚持限制我方处置朝鲜境内机场设备的权利，妄图干涉我方内政。六天以来，我方代表已经详尽地驳斥了对方所谓我方境内机场设备威胁对方安全，以及所谓停战后对方应该仍旧保有狂轰滥炸以阻挠我方境内设备的权利的自相矛盾的荒谬论点。一月十五日对方又提出了所谓维持军事平衡，保持战时现状的荒谬理论。我方代表严正指出：“自从谈判开始以来，我方本着彻底和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯立场，提出了撤退一切外国军队以及以三八线为军事分界线的方案。我方的主张是要有远见地、有步骤地彻底和平解决朝鲜问题，彻底熄灭朝鲜的战火。你方却相反地企图在朝鲜继续战争，企图在停战后继续在朝鲜保持长期战争状态，以便在全世界制造紧张局面，实现你方的战争政策。你方不仅反对我方公平的有利于和平的主张，而且更有意地对我方的和平主张加以污蔑，以掩饰你方实行战争政策的意图。第三项议程的讨论更充分地暴露了你方的这一意图。正因为你方企图在朝鲜保持长期战争状态，因此，你方提出了自朝鲜境外无限制地进入军事人员与武器弹药的轮换与补充，以及你方人员在我方后方自由视察的要求。为了首先满足全世界爱好和平人民在朝鲜实现停战的初步和平愿望，我方又建议在停战期间，双方不自朝鲜境外进入任何增援的军事力量，包括作战飞机在内，并由中立国家进行视察，当军事停战委员会中任何一方请求调查违反停战协议事件时，中立国监察机构即应进行调查。这样，我方已经提供了完整而充分的足以保证停战稳定的公平合理的方案。如你方也和我方一样，愿作同样的保证，并确实遵守这种保证，停战期间任何一方大量增加其在朝鲜的军事力量，是不可能设想的。但你方却仍然坚持以限制朝鲜境内机场为藉口妄图干涉我方内政。你方不可能不了解，不容许干涉我方内政是我方坚决不可动摇的立场。在我方境内进行或不进行任何设备的问题完全属于内政问题，不容许你方过问，更不容许在谈判会议上讨价还价。我方一月九日的方案已经提出了解决第三项议程中双方分歧的充分的完整的和合理的办法。会议的进展完全有赖于你方放弃干涉我方内政的无理要求。”第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表首先向对方提出，十四日二十一时我方江东第八俘虏营为对方飞机所轰炸，炸死对方被俘人员十人以上，炸伤六十人以上，要求对方予以严重注意。我方代表并列举对方发言与提案中自相矛盾之处，向对方提出质问。对方提案中第一条声称：全体战俘应予释放，但其他各条中却又规定释放要有“宣誓”的条件，遣送要有“一对一”的条件和所谓“志愿”的条件，显然企图扣留我方被俘人员，送交蒋、李匪帮，那能算是全体释放？对方声称同意我方协助所有流离失所的平民归返家园的主张，为什么又在提案中违反议程的明确规定，将根本没有参加作战的平民与战俘混作一谈，要求以平民与战俘在“一对一”的基础上进行交易？更有什么理由以我方被俘战士作为人质？对方又声称对方提案是对双方有利的，如果我方亦要求对方释放与遣送全体我方人员，而我方只遣送一部分对方人员，要求对方以平民交换其余对方被俘人员，对方是否可以同意？对方一再声称，即将交来的我方被俘人员一千四百五十六人的差额和四万四千二百零五名我方人员的下落的材料，何以至今仍未交来？对方对我方质问一再避免答复，声称将在明日提出回答，但又称明天的回答未必比今天的回答更好。我方代表指出，只有确实遵守停战后释放与遣送全体战俘的原则，放弃扣留我方被俘人员作为人质的阴谋，对方才能从自相矛盾的言论中解脱出来。
