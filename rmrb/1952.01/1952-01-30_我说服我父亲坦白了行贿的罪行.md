    I Persuaded My Father to Confess His Bribery Crime
    My name is Sheng Yusen, and I am a member of the Communist Youth League in the Seventh District Night School of Beijing.
    In the winter of 1950, my cousin, Sheng Ruizhi, who ran a cotton yarn shop, was sentenced by the Beijing People's Court to two years in prison and fined 10 million yuan for speculation and disrupting the cotton yarn market. My father hired an old lawyer, Li Yizhou, to help with the appeal. Li Yizhou colluded with Shi Jinghou, a retained personnel member of the Beijing People's Court, to find a solution. My father treated Shi Jinghou to more than ten meals and gave him 4 million yuan. Shi Jinghou also borrowed 4 million yuan from my father. In the spring of 1951, my cousin Sheng Ruizhi was released. My father then gave Shi Jinghou another 2 million yuan. He also gave Li Yizhou five bags of flour as a "thank you." I thought that my cousin Sheng Ruizhi was able to be released because Shi Jinghou had been bribed by my father.
    After the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began, I decided to persuade my father to confess quickly. I talked to my father, but he coldly said, "What do you children know? Don't interfere with my affairs." It turned out that my father had already discussed the matter with Li Yizhou and others, and they all agreed not to confess. Later, my father went to Tianjin for business reasons. On December 30th last year, after listening to Mayor Peng Zhen's broadcast, I gained a clearer understanding of the significance of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. In addition, I also heard some related propaganda. I became increasingly worried. I thought about how I had suffered abuse from my mother-in-law and husband in the past; after liberation, I became a completely free person and was able to attend night school and participate in various patriotic activities. Thinking of this, I gained courage. I was determined to fight against this criminal behavior. I wanted my father to confess.
    Under my urging, my father returned from Tianjin. I, along with my younger sister and uncle, mobilized my father to confess. I decided at the time that if my father remained stubborn and refused to confess, I would immediately report him. The result was good; my father went to confess.
    After my father confessed, he did not receive any punishment, and he felt very relieved. I did something beneficial to the country and the people, and I was also very happy. Sheng Yusen (narrated), Li Guangzhe (recorded)

### 我说服我父亲坦白了行贿的罪行

    我说服我父亲坦白了行贿的罪行
    我叫盛玉森，是北京市第七区夜校里的一个青年团员。
    一九五零年冬天，我的开棉纱庄的本家哥哥盛瑞芝，因为买空卖空、投机倒把，扰乱棉纱市场，被北京市人民法院依法判处两年徒刑，罚款一千万元。我父亲找了一个旧律师李艺舟帮忙上诉。李艺舟勾结了北京市人民法院里一个叫史靖侯的留用人员，替他想办法。我父亲请史靖侯吃了十几次饭，送了他四百万元，史靖侯又向我父亲借了四百万元。一九五一年春天，我哥哥盛瑞芝就被释放出来了。我父亲又送给史靖侯二百万元。他还送给李艺舟五袋面粉，“表示谢意”。我想，我哥哥盛瑞芝能够被释放，一定是史靖侯受了我父亲贿赂的结果。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，我决定劝我父亲赶快坦白。我找我父亲谈话。但我父亲却冷酷地说：“你们小孩子懂得什么？你不要管我的事。”原来我父亲已经和李艺舟等商量好了，大家都不要坦白。以后，我父亲因为做生意的关系，到天津去了。去年十二月三十日，我听了彭真市长的广播，更明确地认识了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的意义。另外，我还听了一些有关的宣传。我在心里越发“嘀咕”起来。我想，我过去受婆婆、丈夫的虐待，受苦受气；解放后，我成了一个完全自由的人，能够参加夜校学习、参加各种爱国活动。想到这里，我的勇气来了。我决心和这种犯罪行为进行斗争。我要我父亲坦白。
    在我的催促下，我父亲从天津回来了。我就和妹妹、叔叔一起动员父亲坦白。我当时决定：如果父亲还是顽固不化，坚决不肯坦白的话，那我马上就检举他。结果很好，父亲去坦白了。
    我父亲坦白后，并没有受到什么处分，他觉得很痛快。我做了一件有利于国家和人民的事情，也十分高兴。　盛玉森述　李光哲记
