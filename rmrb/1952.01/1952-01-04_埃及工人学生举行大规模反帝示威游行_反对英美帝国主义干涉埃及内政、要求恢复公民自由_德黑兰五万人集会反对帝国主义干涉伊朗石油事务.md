    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: Cairo news: Workers and students across Egypt held anti-imperialist demonstrations on December 30th of last year. Demonstrators demanded that the government take resolute measures to meet the demands of the Egyptian people. Demonstrators shouted slogans against British and American imperialists interfering in Egypt's internal affairs and demanded the restoration of civil liberties.
    Prior to this, workers and students in various parts of Egypt had held large-scale demonstrations on December 26th and 27th. Demonstrators demanded swift measures to drive out the British occupiers and protested the appointment of pro-British figures Hafez Afifi as Privy Counselor and Amir as the Egyptian King's diplomatic advisor. Afifi served as the Egyptian Ambassador to the United Kingdom before World War II and was one of the Egyptian representatives who participated in drafting and signing the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty; Amir was the recently recalled Egyptian Ambassador to the United Kingdom by the Egyptian government.
    Although the appointments of Afifi and Amir were welcomed by the British side, Egyptian workers and students quickly protested. On December 26th, workers and students in Cairo and Alexandria held demonstrations. They shouted slogans against British imperialism during the march. Police fired shotguns at the marching workers and students and threw tear gas at them. As a result, more than 20 students were injured.
    On December 27th, workers and students in Cairo and Alexandria continued to hold demonstrations. Demonstrators were also suppressed by the police. In Alexandria, thirty-five students were injured.
    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: TASS, Tehran dispatch: A mass rally convened by the "Iranian National Anti-Imperialist Oil Company Struggle Association" was held in Tehran's Fuzia Square on December 28th. Approximately 50,000 workers, artisans, intellectuals, students, small merchants, and representatives of other strata from the Iranian capital and its neighboring areas participated in the rally. The masses held horizontal banners and placards with slogans against the imperialist "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's" interference in Iranian oil affairs and against the imperialists' intention to turn Iran into a bridgehead for war. The masses' slogans also demanded that Iran sever relations with the imperialist aggressive blocs; conclude trade treaties with democratic countries; punish those who created the bloody incidents of July 15th and December 6th in Tehran; recognize the People's Republic of China and expel the American advisors in Iran. Leaders of the "Iranian National Anti-Imperialist Oil Company Struggle Association" pointed out in their speeches to the conference the danger of the Iranian authorities secretly trading with the "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development" on the oil issue. Speakers at the conference emphasized that the "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's" interference in Iranian oil affairs is as harmful as the repealed 1933 Anglo-Iranian Oil Company treaty. The speakers called on the participants to participate in the 17th parliamentary elections regardless of any adverse circumstances in order to elect those representatives with democratic ideas.

    反对英美帝国主义干涉埃及内政、要求恢复公民自由
    德黑兰五万人集会反对帝国主义干涉伊朗石油事务
    【新华社二日讯】开罗消息：埃及全国各地工人和学生在去年十二月三十日纷纷举行反对帝国主义的示威游行。示威者要求政府采取坚决的措施以满足埃及全国人民的要求。示威者高呼反对英美帝国主义者干涉埃及内政的口号，并要求恢复公民自由。
    在此以前，埃及各地的工人和学生曾在十二月二十六日、二十七日举行大规模的示威游行。示威者要求迅速采取措施把英国占领者赶出去，并抗议任命亲英分子哈非兹·阿非非为枢密大臣和艾密尔为埃及国王的外交顾问。阿非非在第二次世界大战前曾任埃及驻英大使，并为参加起草及签署一九三六年英埃条约的埃及代表之一；艾密尔是新近被埃及政府召回的埃及驻英大使。
    阿非非和艾密尔的任命虽然得到了英国方面的欢迎，但是埃及的工人和学生很快地就提出抗议。十二月二十六日，开罗和亚历山大港的工人和学生都举行了示威游行。他们在游行时高呼反对英帝国主义的口号。警察曾以猎枪向游行的工人和学生队伍开火，并向他们投掷催泪弹。结果共有二十多名学生受伤。
    十二月二十七日，开罗和亚历山大港的工人、学生继续举行示威游行。示威者也曾受到警察的镇压。在亚历山大港，学生受伤的达三十五名。
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社德黑兰讯：由“伊朗全国反帝国主义石油公司斗争协会”召集的群众大会于十二月二十八日在德黑兰的法齐亚广场举行。约有五万名工人、手工业者、知识分子、学生、小商人以及伊朗首都及其邻区的其他阶层的代表们参加了这次大会。群众手持着横旗和标语牌上面写着反对帝国主义的“国际复兴开发银行”干涉伊朗石油事务的口号和反对帝国主义者打算把伊朗变为战争的桥头堡的口号。群众的口号并要求伊朗和帝国主义侵略集团断绝关系；和民主国家缔结贸易条约；惩罚那些制造七月十五日和十二月六日德黑兰血腥事件的人们；承认中华人民共和国并驱逐在伊朗的美国顾问。“伊朗全国反帝国主义石油公司斗争协会”的领袖们在向大会致词中，指出了伊朗当局就石油问题和“国际复兴开发银行”作秘密交易的危险性。在大会上演说的人们强调指出：“国际复兴开发银行”干涉伊朗石油事务，是和废除了的英伊石油公司一九三三年条约同样有害的。演说的人们号召到会的人不顾任何不利情况，参加第十七届议会选举，以选出那些有民主思想的代表。
