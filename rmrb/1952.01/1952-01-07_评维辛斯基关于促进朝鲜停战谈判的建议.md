    In the meeting of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 3rd of this month, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, put forward a proposal to achieve and strengthen international peace and security. In this proposal, in addition to advocating that the United Nations General Assembly abolish the Collective Measures Committee, a conspiracy organization to expand aggressive war, the Soviet Union also suggested considering measures to eliminate the current international tension and establish international friendly relations, and first of all, measures that should be taken to help the Korean armistice negotiations to achieve a successful conclusion. Under the circumstances where the United States continues to stubbornly and unreasonably obstruct and delay the Korean armistice negotiations, and intensifies its arms expansion and war preparations in its own country and its vassal states, and continues to create international tension, this further effort by the Soviet government to strive for peace is welcome.
    The successful completion of the Korean armistice negotiations and the realization of a ceasefire in Korea are the consistent goals of the efforts and struggles of the Chinese and Korean people and the Soviet people, and are also the unanimous and urgent demands of peace-loving people all over the world (including the people of the United States and Britain). Since the beginning of the Korean armistice negotiations, the representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides have consistently demonstrated the spirit of actively striving to reach an agreement on a fair and reasonable basis. However, despite this, the Korean armistice negotiations have been obstructed and delayed by the US side using various despicable methods, so that they have been going on for half a year, and have not yet been successful. The US side's stubborn and unreasonable attitude of delaying the negotiations has been severely condemned by our representatives and peace-loving people all over the world, and has aroused widespread anger among the people of the United States and Britain and dissatisfaction among its allied countries. Since an agreement was reached on the second item on the agenda of the Korean armistice negotiations due to the firm attitude and active efforts of our representatives, a stalemate has been encountered on the third and fourth items on the agenda due to the US side's continued implementation of delaying tactics.
    Anyone who understands the truth and cares about world peace will see from the arrogant, barbaric, despicable, and shameless attitude shown by the US side on the third and fourth items on the agenda of the Korean negotiations, how bloodthirsty the US government and its negotiating representatives in Korea are. In order to continue to reap bloody war profits for the big American capitalists, they cruelly continue to plunge Korea into the bloodbath of the aggressive war they launched, they do not hesitate to drive the soldiers of the United States, Britain, and their vassal states to continue to make unnecessary sacrifices on the Korean battlefield, they do not hesitate to prevent millions of Korean people from returning to their homes, they do not hesitate to prevent tens of thousands of prisoners of war on both sides from peacefully reuniting with their families, and they do not hesitate to continue to create a tense international situation, so that the whole world feels a serious threat of war. The "Newsweek," a mouthpiece of the big American capitalists, nakedly confessed the shameful intentions of the American rogues and swindlers in delaying the Korean armistice negotiations in an issue on December 24 last year: "The government is now quite worried, not knowing what impact a Korean armistice will have on the rearmament plan." "No matter what happens in Korea, Truman will always emphasize the necessity of preparation in his State of the Union Address and Budget Address. He will make these demands: 1. Allocate more funds for the defense of the United States (especially the Air Force); 2. Increase taxes; 3. Do not give up the foreign aid plan (note: that is, the US plan to force its vassal states to intensify their war preparations); 4. Restore all economic controls. It may be very difficult to achieve these goals under the current circumstances, and it will be even more difficult after the shooting stops. They simply can't think of any good way to prevent people from letting up after the Korean War ends."
    It is because the heartless big American capitalists are determined to extract more bloody war profits from the people of the United States and its allied countries that the Korean armistice negotiations could not make the progress they should have after an agreement was reached on the second item on the agenda. The American negotiating representatives appeared as robbers, stubbornly turning their unreasonable demands to interfere in Korea's internal affairs into the "rights" they could do, and even after the military pressure they had always relied on had proved to be a failure on the battlefield, they still shamelessly brought it out, arrogantly declaring that they would solve the problem with artillery and bombs; they were so crazy and unrestrained that they openly threatened our representatives with "attacking China is as easy as pie"; they appeared as swindlers, stubbornly turning their attempt to detain our captured personnel and refuse the release and repatriation of all prisoners of war on both sides into their "humanitarian" principle, saying that they were "only thinking about the welfare of these people (referring to the American prisoners of war) and the sorrow of their families"; they appeared as rogues, on the one hand coercing their allies to make "the greatest contribution in terms of troops and other aspects" to the war of aggression against Korea, on the other hand arbitrarily and domineeringly delaying the Korean negotiations for their own interests, and not allowing any of their allies to hear any issues in the negotiations.
    As everyone knows, the war of aggression against Korea launched by the United States is being carried out under the banner of the so-called United Nations, and the US government is trying its best to promote that this is for the "interests of the United Nations," and repeatedly blames the countries participating in the aggression for not being enthusiastic enough about this "collective measure." But the wonderful thing is: since it is a "collective measure," why doesn't the US government solicit or accept the opinions of its allied countries at all in the Korean armistice negotiations? Why, despite the open indignation of countries such as Britain and France at the US government's delaying policy in the negotiations, do the American negotiating representatives not make the slightest modification to their delaying policy?
    What exactly is the US so-called "collective measure," and whether the United States treats its allied countries as partners or slaves, Vyshinsky's proposal is the most straightforward test. The American dictators don't even dare to bring the Korean negotiation issue to the United Nations Security Council. According to a report from the US News Agency in Washington on the 4th of this month, US Secretary of State Acheson has publicly stated: "The United States will vote against the Soviet proposal submitted to the United Nations in Paris on Thursday." This proves that the US government will continue to stubbornly and arbitrarily implement its delaying policy in the Korean negotiations. This also proves that the US policy is now a completely isolated policy in the world. Such an isolated policy will inevitably fail.

### 评维辛斯基关于促进朝鲜停战谈判的建议

    评维辛斯基关于促进朝鲜停战谈判的建议
    在本月三日联合国大会政治委员会的会议上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基提出了一个获致并加强国际和平与安全的建议。在这个建议中，苏联除了主张联合国大会取消集体措施委员会这个扩大侵略战争的阴谋组织之外，并建议考虑消除目前国际紧张局势和建立国际友好关系的措施问题，而首先是为帮助朝鲜停战谈判获得顺利结束所应采取的措施问题。在美国继续蛮横无理地阻挠与拖延朝鲜停战谈判，并在其本国及附庸国家中加紧扩军备战活动，而继续制造国际紧张局势的情形下，苏联政府这一进一步争取和平的努力，是值得欢迎的。
    顺利完成朝鲜停战谈判，实现朝鲜停火，是中朝人民和苏联人民一贯努力和争取的目标，也是全世界爱好和平人民（包括美英等国人民）一致的、迫切的要求。因为在朝鲜实现停火，不但将使朝鲜问题有可能得到和平解决，并且也将由此而打开和平解决远东其他问题和消除世界紧张局势的道路。在朝鲜停战谈判开始以来，朝中方面的代表始终表现了在公平合理的基础上积极争取达成协议的精神。但是尽管如此，朝鲜停战谈判却由于美方采取了种种可耻的方法进行阻挠和拖延，以致进行了半年之久，至今还没有成功。美方这种拖延谈判的蛮横无理的态度，曾遭受到我方代表及世界爱好和平人民的严厉斥责，并引起了美英人民的普遍愤怒及其同盟国家的不满。在朝鲜停战谈判的第二项议程，由于我方代表的坚定态度和积极的努力而达成协议以来，目前在第三项和第四项议程上，又由于美方继续实行拖延战术而遇到了僵局。
    任何明白事理、关心世界和平的人，都会从美方在朝鲜谈判的第三项和第四项议程上所表现的狂妄蛮横、卑鄙无耻的态度中，看出美国政府及其在朝鲜的谈判代表是怎样的嗜杀成性。它们为了替美国大资本家继续博取血腥的战争利润，不惜残忍地使朝鲜继续陷于它们所发动的侵略战争的血泊中，不惜驱使美英及其附庸国家的士兵继续在朝鲜战场上作无谓的牺牲，不惜使千千万万的朝鲜人民不能重归家园，不惜使成万的双方战俘不能与家人和平团聚，不惜继续制造国际局势的紧张状态，使全世界都感受着严重的战争威胁。美国大资本家的喉舌“新闻周刊”在去年十二月二十四日的一期中曾经赤裸裸地把美国的无赖和骗子们拖延朝鲜停战谈判的可耻的用心供述出来：“政府现在颇为忧虑，不知道朝鲜停战会对重整军备计划产生什么影响。”“不论朝鲜发生什么情况，杜鲁门总会在他的国情咨文和预算咨文里强调准备的必要。他会提出这些要求：一、为美国的防务（特别是空军）拨出更多的款项；二、增加赋税；三、不放弃对外援助计划（按：即美国压迫它的附庸国家加紧备战的计划）；四、恢复一切经济管制。在目前的情况下想达到这些目的，可能是很困难的，如果射击停止以后，甚至还要更加困难。他们简直想不出任何好办法，不让人们在朝鲜战争结束后松劲。”
    就是因为毫无心肝的美国大资本家决心要从美国及其同盟各国的人民身上榨取更多的血腥的战争利润，所以朝鲜停战谈判不能在第二项议程获得协议后得到应有的进展。美国谈判代表们以强盗的面目出现，硬把他们企图干涉朝鲜内政的无理要求，说成是他们能够做到的“权利”，甚至在其一向所倚赖的军事压力已经在战场上证明失败之后，仍然无耻地把它搬出来，狂妄地宣称要以大炮和炸弹等来解决问题；他们竟疯狂放肆到如此地步，公然以“攻击中国易如儿戏”来威胁我方代表；他们以骗子的面目出现，硬把他们企图扣留我方被俘人员，拒绝双方全体战俘的释放与遣送，说成是他们的“人道主义”原则，说成他们是“一心只想到这些人（指美军被俘人员）的福利和他们家庭的哀痛”；他们以无赖的面目出现，一面要胁他们的同盟国对侵朝战争“在军队及其他方面作最大的贡献”，一面独断专横地为他们本身的利益拖延朝鲜谈判，而不许他们的任何同盟国预闻谈判中的任何问题。
    大家知道，美国所发动的在朝鲜的侵略战争，是打着所谓联合国的旗帜来进行的，美国政府竭力宣传这是为着“联合国的利益”，并且再三责备参加侵略各国对于这个“集体措施”太不热心。可是奇妙的事情是：既然是“集体措施”，为什么美国政府在朝鲜停战的谈判中却丝毫也不征求或接受它的同盟各国的意见呢？为什么尽管英法等国对于美国政府在谈判中的拖延政策表示公开的愤慨，而美国的谈判代表对于他们的拖延政策却没有丝毫的修改呢？
    美国的所谓“集体措施”究竟是一个什么东西，美国对它的同盟各国究竟是当作伙伴还是奴隶，维辛斯基的建议是一个最直截了当的考验。美国独裁者连把朝鲜谈判问题提到联合国安理会去都不敢。据美国新闻处华盛顿本月四日的报道，美国国务卿艾奇逊已公开表示：“美国将投票反对苏联在星期四在巴黎向联合国提出的建议”。这证明了美国政府还要继续在朝鲜谈判中独断独行地实行拖延政策。这又证明了美国的政策现在是在世界上彻底孤立的政策。这种孤立的政策是不会不失败的。
