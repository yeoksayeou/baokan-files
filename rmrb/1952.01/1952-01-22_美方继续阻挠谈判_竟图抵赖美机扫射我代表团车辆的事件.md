Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 21st: At the subcommittee meeting on the third item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 21st, the other side once again adopted an attitude unwilling to resolve the issue. The meeting was adjourned shortly after it began, lasting only ten minutes. Our representative pointed out: "In order to ensure the stability of the armistice, our side has made every reasonable suggestion for the resolution of the third item on the agenda, and no further changes are possible. Now the Korean armistice negotiations have basically reached an agreement, and all peace-loving people in the world recognize this. However, your side still stubbornly insists on interfering in our internal affairs by making unreasonable demands to inspect airport facilities within Korea. This is entirely for the purpose of delaying and disrupting the armistice negotiations, and there is no other reason."

At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth item on the agenda, our representative reiterated our firm and unwavering position: "Our side firmly opposes and will forever oppose the conspiracy to detain our captured personnel under any pretext and hand them over to the Li-Jiang bandit gang. Our side will never abandon the principle of unconditionally releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war."

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 21st: Our correspondent reports: In the liaison officers' meeting between the two sides on the 21st, the opposing liaison officer, Mulay, attempted to confuse the public and evade responsibility for the U.S. aircraft strafing and bombing the Korean-Chinese delegation's convoy on the 18th. First, Mulay admitted that four U.S. aircraft did attack ground targets near the Hanpo Bridge for as long as twenty minutes on the 18th. But then he said it was some kind of "fixed target attack," and if "due to an unfortunate coincidence," "your convoy was damaged," "we feel regret." The fact is that the Korean-Chinese delegation's convoy was continuously attacked by U.S. aircraft 40 meters north of the Hanpo Bridge that day, and two staff members in the vehicles were wounded by bullets. This is clearly not a "fixed target attack." Our Colonel Zhang Chunshan expressed his dissatisfaction with Mulay's attitude of not wanting to face the facts and attempting to evade responsibility for the January 18th incident. Colonel Zhang Chunshan pointed out: Mulay's so-called "fixed target" refers to the anti-aircraft artillery position south of the bridge, so the Korean-Chinese delegation's convoy was 40 meters north of the bridge, so what does this have to do with the other side's so-called "fixed target"! Colonel Zhang Chunshan also pointed out that the Korean-Chinese delegation only had this convoy with the prescribed markings driving south on the 18th. In order to eliminate any excuses for the other side to evade responsibility, Colonel Zhang Chunshan proposed that our staff members who encountered the danger in the vehicles could testify in person. Mulay had to agree to conduct an investigation at Panmunjom at 3 p.m. on the 22nd.

Regarding the incident of U.S. aircraft bombing the Kaesong Neutral Zone on the 17th, Mulay did not express an attitude at today's liaison officers' meeting.

    美方继续阻挠谈判
    竟图抵赖美机扫射我代表团车辆的事件
    【新华社开城二十一日电】二十一日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方再次采取了不愿解决问题的态度，会议开始不久就建议休会，会议历时仅十分钟。我方代表指出：“为了保证停战的稳定，我方对于第三项议程的解决已经作了一切合理的建议，再不可能有任何改变。现在朝鲜停战谈判已经基本上达成协议，全世界爱好和平的人士都承认这一点。而你方却还要蛮横坚持干涉我方内政的过问朝鲜境内机场设备的无理要求，这完全是为了拖延和破坏停战谈判，没有任何其他理由。”
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表再度提出我方坚决不可动摇的立场：“我方坚决反对，并将永远反对在任何藉口下，扣留我方被俘人员移交李蒋匪帮的阴谋。我方将永远不会放弃无条件释放和遣送全体战俘的原则。”
    【新华社开城二十一日电】本社记者报道：在二十一日双方联络官会议中，对方联络官穆莱企图混淆视听，逃避十八日美机扫射轰炸朝中代表团车队的责任。首先，穆莱承认十八日美机四架确曾在汗浦桥附近向地面目标进行攻击达二十分钟之久。但又说那是什么“固定目标攻击”，如果“出于不幸的偶合”，“你方车队遭受损坏”，“我方感觉遗憾”。事实是：那天朝中代表团的车队在汗浦桥以北四十公尺处，遭受美机连续的攻击，车上工作人员两名身受弹伤。这显然不是什么“固定目标攻击”。我方张春山上校对穆莱这种不愿正视事实，企图逃避十八日事件责任的态度，表示不能满意。张春山上校指出：穆莱的所谓“固定目标”是指桥南的高射炮阵地，那么朝中代表团的车队是在桥北四十公尺处，这与对方的所谓“固定目标”有什么相干呢！张春山上校并指出：十八日朝中代表团仅有这个缀有规定标志的车队向南行驶。为了解除对方逃避责任的任何藉口，张春山上校提出：我方车上遇险工作人员可以当面作证。穆莱不得不同意二十二日下午三时在板门店进行调查。
    对十七日美机轰炸开城中立区事件，在今日联络官会议上穆莱竟未表示态度。
