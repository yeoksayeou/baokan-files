Northwest Region Higher Education Faculty and Staff Learning Committee Holds Self-Reform Mobilization Meeting

The Northwest Region Higher Education Faculty and Staff Learning Committee held a self-reform learning mobilization meeting on December 29th of last year. Attending the meeting were Yang Mingxuan, Director of the Northwest Region Higher Education Faculty and Staff Learning Committee, Deputy Director Zhang Jiafu, and more than 1,300 faculty, staff, and student representatives from six universities near Xi'an. Representatives from organizations such as the Northwest Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League also attended.

The meeting invited Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, to give a mobilization report on ideological remolding. Zhang Zhizhong pointed out that over the past two years, faculty and staff in Northwest universities have made some progress politically and ideologically through preliminary self-education. These advances have created certain conditions for this self-reform learning. After explaining the great significance of intellectuals' ideological remolding to the cause of the Chinese people's revolution, he analyzed and criticized the rather widespread tendencies of pure technical viewpoints, employment viewpoints, liberalism, and individualism among faculty and staff in Northwest universities. He pointed out that some teachers do not consider the interests of the people and the country in their work, but instead think about their personal status, reputation, and treatment. He said: "These backward ideological consciousnesses run counter to the needs of today's New China's construction. Every New China university teacher must recognize their sacred responsibility of cultivating outstanding construction talents for the country and consciously rise up and fight against these incorrect thoughts." He emphasized that some teachers still have strong feudal and comprador ideas; individual teachers have even lost their people's stance due to the development of these reactionary ideas. This kind of thinking is the main obstacle to the current reform work of universities, and we must resolutely eliminate it. Zhang Zhizhong also used his experience in ideological remolding to illustrate that standing firm, distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, humbly learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practicalities of the Chinese revolution, and daring to carry out criticism and self-criticism are the keys to carrying out learning. He also criticized some faculty and staff's incorrect learning attitudes of being hot and cold in previous political studies and resisting criticism. He hoped that faculty and staff of all universities can earnestly carry out conscious self-reform work on the basis of unity and mutual assistance.

Jiang Longji, Minister of Education of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, spoke at the meeting. He explained that the purpose of this study is to gradually establish the leadership of the working class ideology in schools and further reform universities. He asked faculty and staff of all schools to dispel all kinds of worries, establish a correct attitude towards learning, and ensure the smooth progress of learning. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西北区高等学校教职员学委会
    举行自我改造学习动员大会
    西北区高等学校教职员学习委员会在去年十二月二十九日举行自我改造学习动员大会，出席大会的有西北区高等学校教职员学习委员会主任杨明轩、副主任张稼夫等和西安附近六个高等学校的教职员、学生代表等一千三百多人。中国新民主主义青年团西北工作委员会等机关也派代表参加。
    大会邀请西北军政委员会副主席张治中作了思想改造的动员报告。张治中指出，西北各高等学校教职员两年来经过初步自我教育，在政治上、思想上已有了某些进步，这些进步使这次自我改造学习具备了一定的条件。他在说明了知识分子思想改造对中国人民革命事业的重大意义以后，对目前西北区各高等学校教职员中相当普遍存在的单纯技术观点、雇佣观点和自由主义、个人主义思想等不良倾向，作了分析和批判。他指出，有些教师在工作中对人民和国家利益不加考虑，处处从个人地位、名誉、待遇着想。他说：“这些落后的思想意识是和今天新中国的建设需要背道而驰的。每一个新中国的高等学校教师，必须认清自己负有培养国家优秀的建设人才的神圣责任，自觉地起来和这些不正确的思想进行斗争。”他着重指出，有些教师现在还存在着浓厚的封建思想和买办思想；个别教师甚至由于这种反动思想的发展，已失去了人民立场。这种思想是目前高等学校改革工作的主要阻力，我们一定要坚决把它肃清。张治中并以他的思想改造的经验说明：站定立场、分清敌我、虚心学习马克思列宁主义及马克思列宁主义和中国革命实际相结合的毛泽东思想、勇于展开批评和自我批评是开展学习的关键。他还批判了有些教职员在以往政治学习中的冷热病和抗拒批评的不正确的学习态度。他希望各高等学校教职员能够在团结互助的基础上，认真地进行自觉的自我改造工作。
    西北军政委员会教育部部长江隆基在会上发言。他说明这次学习以达到逐步确立工人阶级思想在学校中的领导地位和进一步改革高等学校为目的；要求各校教职员打消各种顾虑，建立正确的学习态度，保证学习顺利进行。（新华社）
