Economic Briefs

    ▲ The Northeast People's Government's Department of Industry issued a "Provisional Measures on Saving Cement in Capital Construction" on December 29th of last year, requiring all subordinate units to save cement in large quantities in capital construction. According to the Department of Industry's calculations, if this provisional measure for saving cement is fully implemented, the cement usage quota for construction projects of all subordinate units in 1952 can be reduced by 30% compared to last year.

    In terms of the design of capital construction, the Department of Industry stipulates: clay tiles should be used extensively on the roofs of general buildings to replace cement tiles. All one- and two-story general buildings (such as dormitories and offices) or factory buildings below eight meters that are not subject to vibration, as well as the top floor of multi-story buildings, are strictly prohibited from being built with cement and should be built with lime-sand mortar instead. In general factory buildings, cement plastering is not allowed except for necessary parts. Lime-sand mortar is not allowed to be mixed with cement for the interior walls of general buildings such as offices and dormitories that require lime-sand plastering. The exterior walls of all kinds of houses should use clear water walls, using cement mixed with lime and sand for pointing or plastering. All door and window lintels should use brick arches or reinforced concrete brick mixed lintels. All roads, large and small, within the factory area should be replaced with gravel pavement, cinder pavement, or cobblestone pavement, and cement paving is not allowed.
    ▲ Chengdu-Chongqing Railway workers and laborers are working hard to ensure the full line opens to traffic on August 1st, Army Day, this year. In the past year and a half, nearly all the earthwork and stonework for the entire line's roadbed has been completed, and track laying has reached 299 kilometers (to Yinshan Town, northwest of Neijiang, at the end of last year). The track laying project is progressing daily. This year, another 30,000 laborers will work hard to excavate 3.36 million cubic meters of earth and stone, build 1,393 meters of bridge superstructure, 1,145 meters of tunnels, and 64 culverts on the Chengdu Plain. The leading organs are now summarizing the experience gained in last year's construction projects in order to widely apply and introduce it to the whole country.
    ▲ Employees of the Southwest District Company of the China Department Store saved 3 billion yuan in commodity circulation costs in the fourth quarter of last year, fulfilling the labor competition challenge conditions proposed to the employees of the Northwest District Company, and laying a good foundation for further development of the production increase and frugality movement.

    ▲东北人民政府工业部在去年十二月二十九日发布了一个“关于在基本建设中节约水泥的暂行办法”，要求所属各单位在基本建设中大量节约水泥。据工业部计算，这个节约水泥的暂行办法如全部实现，所属各单位一九五二年建筑工程中的水泥使用定额可比去年降低百分之三十。
    在基本建设的设计方面，工业部规定：一般建筑物的房盖上大量采用黏土瓦，以代替水泥瓦。凡是一层、两层的一般建筑物（如宿舍、办公室）或低于八公尺不受震动的厂房，以及多层建筑物的最上一层房屋，一律禁止用水泥砌造，改用石灰砂胶泥砌造。一般厂房里除必要部分外，不用水泥抹灰，办公室、宿舍等一般建筑物的内墙需用石灰砂抹灰的，石灰砂胶泥里不许搀水泥。各种房屋外墙应采用清水墙，用水泥搀和石灰与砂来嵌缝或粉刷。凡门窗过梁都应用砖拱或采用钢筋混凝土砖砌的混合过梁。凡工厂区内所有大小道路都应改用碎石路面、煤渣路面或弹石路面，不得使用水泥铺路。
    ▲成渝铁路职工和民工正为今年八一建军节全线通车而努力。在过去一年半中，全线路基土石方工程将近全部完工，铺轨已达二百九十九公里（去年年底到内江西北的银山镇）。现铺轨工程正逐日推进。今年还有三万民工将为开凿三百三十六万土石方，修筑一千三百九十三公尺桥梁上部工程、一千一百四十五公尺隧道和川西平原上的六十四座涵洞而努力。现在领导机关正在总结去年修筑工程中的经验，以便普遍运用并向全国介绍。
