The Shijingshan Power Plant held a meeting on the 13th of this month to deal with the embezzlement problems of nine people. Through concrete facts, this meeting explained to all personnel the policy of lenient treatment for those who confess and severe punishment for those who refuse to confess, further advancing the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Shijingshan Power Plant.

At this meeting, leading cadres clearly explained the policies and dispelled the ideological concerns of the masses with concrete facts. Li Zhende, Liu Yue, Feng Runhua, Feng Zixiu, Guo Zhenming, Li Weijiang, Song Wencheng, and other seven embezzlers thoroughly confessed their embezzlement facts, and the leadership treated them leniently. Shi Zengrun (Chief of the Materials Section) and Bao Liantong (Chief of the General Affairs Section) refused to confess and have been arrested by public security organs and will be handled by the court according to law.

Before this meeting, some embezzlers did not fully understand the Party's policies. They did not quite believe in the policy of lenient treatment for those who confess, and they also had incorrect understandings of the severe punishment for those who refuse to confess. Therefore, they had considerable concerns about confessing. After the leading cadres announced the results of the handling at the meeting, the embezzlers truly saw the policy of lenient treatment for those who confess. Before the leading cadres announced his punishment, Guo Zhenming thought, "This time I'm finished." After the leading cadres announced at the meeting that his punishment was removal from his post and a salary reduction, he returned to his office and wrote "Long Live the Communist Party," "Long Live Chairman Mao" in large characters. He guaranteed that he would return the embezzled money (more than one million yuan) to the public within three months. The embezzlers received a profound education at the meeting. Li Weijiang said: The anti-corruption movement saved me. Without this movement, if my embezzlement behavior continued to develop, I would have walked down a dead end.

Currently, this plant is organizing specialists to thoroughly investigate the cases that have been confessed or exposed, and to carry out this movement to the end.

    石景山发电厂召开大会
    对贪污分子分别处理
    坦白的从轻处理，不坦白的被逮捕
    石景山发电厂在本月十三日召开大会，处理了九个人的贪污问题。这个大会以具体事实，向全体人员说明了坦白者从轻处理，拒不坦白者从重处理的政策，把石景山发电厂的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动推进了一步。
    在这次大会中，领导干部明确地交代了政策，并以具体事实，打破了群众的思想顾虑。李振德、刘岳、冯润华、冯自修、郭振明、李维江、宋文成等七个贪污分子彻底坦白了自己的贪污事实，领导方面对于他们从轻处理；史增润（材料股长）、包联桐（庶务股长）拒不坦白，已被公安机关逮捕起来，将由法院依法办理。
    在这次大会以前，有些贪污分子还不很了解党的政策。他们不很相信坦白者从宽处理的政策，对于拒不坦白从重处理，也有不正确的认识。因此，对於坦白颇有顾虑。领导干部在大会上宣布了处理结果以后，贪污分子真正看到了坦白者从轻处理的政策。郭振明在领导干部没有宣布处分以前，他想：“这次完了。”领导干部在会上宣布他的处分是撤职减薪，他回到办公室后，就写了“共产党万岁”、“毛主席万岁”十个大字。他保证在三个月内，把赃款（一百多万元）补还公家。贪污分子在会上受到了深刻的教育。李维江说：反贪污运动救了我。如果没有这个运动，我的贪污行为再发展下去，就要走上死路了。
    目前，这个厂正在组织专人彻底检查已经坦白的或暴露出来的案件，把这个运动进行到底。
