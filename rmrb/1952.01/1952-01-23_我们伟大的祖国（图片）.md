    In the production increase and conservation movement, workers in the machine manufacturing industry in Shenyang City concentrated their wisdom to create and promote the method of multi-tool and multi-edge cutting. The combined application of this advanced method with the Soviet Union's high-speed cutting method is of great significance to the development of China's machine manufacturing industry. This is a scene of representatives from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places visiting the Shenyang Machine Tool Factory No. 5 to observe the implementation of the multi-tool and multi-edge cutting method.
