    Publicly Owned Dinghai Electric Plant in Zhejiang
    New Atmosphere After Implementing Democratic Reform
    Editor: Since the publicly owned Dinghai Electric Plant in Dinghai, Zhejiang, implemented democratic reform, a completely new atmosphere has emerged in the plant. Once, the yarn wrapping on the charcoal truck came loose. Yao Zilai, a veteran worker from the engine room, rushed to repair it despite being ill, and Ma Xiantu, a model worker from the power transmission team, also came to help, preventing a plant-wide blackout. In March of last year, workers from the power transmission team proposed repairing the leaning utility poles and wires in Dinghai city within a month and a half. They braved the wind and rain, working day and night, and victoriously completed the task in twenty-eight days. This reduced electricity leakage by more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month, and together with the electricity meter repair costs, saved the state 30 million yuan. Under the leadership of Yao Zilai, the workers in the engine room successfully experimented with using tea oil instead of lubricating oil, saving 6 million yuan per month. In early September of last year, Zhang Genbao, a worker from the engine and boiler room, added the clause "Do not keep technology secret" to his patriotic pact. He began to tirelessly study methods to improve technology and save fuel. He came up with a method of opening the dampers on the charcoal engine to reduce heat, saving 400 pounds of diesel per month, equivalent to 960,000 yuan in Renminbi. Now, all the workers in the plant have revised their patriotic pacts and production plans, guaranteeing to continuously improve technology and strive for greater achievements.

    浙江定海公营电灯厂
    实行民主改革后出现新气象
    编辑同志：浙江定海公营电灯厂实行了民主改革，厂里立刻出现了崭新的气象。有一次，木炭车的纱包线脱掉了，机房间老师傅姚自来带病抢修，输电股劳动模范马贤图也赶来帮助，使全厂不致停电。去年三月，输电股工人提出要在一个半月内修好定海城倾斜电杆、电线。他们不怕风雨，日夜抢修，二十八天就胜利完成了任务。这样，每月减少了走电一千度以上，加上电表修理费，为国家增产节约了三千万元。机房间工人在姚自来带头下，试用茶油代替润滑油成功，每月可节省六百万元。去年九月初，机炉间工人张根宝在爱国公约上订上了“不保守技术”的一条。他开始孜孜不倦地研究办法，提高技术，节省燃料。他想出了在木炭引擎上开大风门以减低热度的方法，每月节省柴油四百磅，折合人民币九十六万。现在，全厂工人又修订了爱国公约和生产计划，保证不断提高技术，争取更大的成就。　车丁勇
