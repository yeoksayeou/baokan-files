    Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Campaign Universally Launched in Beijing's Business Community; 1,900 Confession and Accusation Materials Received; People's Judicial Organs Will Punish Those Who Refuse to Confess According to Law
    [By Our Newspaper] The anti-corruption and anti-bribery campaign in Beijing's business community has now been universally launched. According to incomplete statistics from the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce at the end of last year, more than 3,000 meetings of various sizes have been held in the city, with a total of more than 66,000 industrialists and businessmen participating (excluding suburban stallholders). As of January 1 this year, the city has received more than 1,900 confession and accusation materials. Currently, the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce is further dispelling the ideological concerns of industrialists and businessmen, vigorously mobilizing them to thoroughly confess and actively report all facts of corruption and bribery.
    The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, its district offices, and various trade associations generally attach great importance to the anti-corruption and anti-bribery campaign. The Federation of Industry and Commerce has established branches of the Economy Inspection Committee. In addition to holding two mobilization rallies at the end of last year, all members and staff of the Federation of Industry and Commerce are assigned to help promote the work in certain industries. For example, if the head of a certain industry association has engaged in bribery and adopts a perfunctory attitude towards the campaign, after being reported by the association's staff, the members of the Economy Inspection branch will personally convene meetings with the association's members, group leaders, and key households to convey Mayor Peng Zhen's report at the Municipal People's Representative Conference and patiently persuade and mobilize them, so that the anti-corruption and anti-bribery campaign in this industry can be launched. Most heads of industry associations have promptly and repeatedly convened meetings of members, group leaders, and all members, and members are assigned to convene regional or group meetings. At these meetings, many heads and members of industry associations who have engaged in bribery can take the lead in confessing. Some industries have their leaders personally convene meetings with key households, or talk to industrialists and businessmen suspected of bribery individually, to mobilize them to confess and report corruption and bribery, which has had a great effect. After such repeated propaganda and mobilization, Beijing's industrialists and businessmen have actively responded to the call to oppose corruption and bribery. Many people have also realized that only confession and accusation is the way out. For example, the vice chairman of a certain industry association said: "After hearing the government's policy on handling tax evasion and supplementary tax payments, I can rest assured." Therefore, the number of industrialists and businessmen who confess and report corruption and bribery has increased compared to the past.
    Although the propaganda and mobilization work of the anti-corruption and anti-bribery campaign in Beijing's business community has been carried out to the point of being known to every household, and has made the general industrialists and businessmen realize that bribery is a shameful and illegal act, this campaign is still not deep enough, and many industrialists and businessmen still cannot bravely and thoroughly confess and report all facts of corruption and bribery. Among the more than 1,900 confession and accusation materials received, in addition to some industrialists and businessmen honestly stating their bribery facts, some people still adopt various insincere and dishonest attitudes towards their criminal behavior. Some people do not admit that they intentionally wooed and seduced cadres, but emphasize that inviting cadres to dinner and movies were "accidental" events. Some people avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, only admitting some minor bribery facts. For example, the owner of a certain store in the auto parts industry initially confessed to only small things. After the head of the industry association talked to him, he admitted that the bribery was over 15 million yuan. Some people only confess to facts that others already know and estimate others will report, while resolutely refusing to talk about other things. Some people, in order to reduce their responsibility, emphasize that the cadres took the initiative to ask them for kickbacks, or to raise the unit price of invoices, etc., and describe themselves as completely passive. Many people completely avoid talking about the illegal benefits they have obtained after bribing cadres.
    Many industrialists and businessmen cannot thoroughly confess and actively report, and adopt a wait-and-see attitude, because they still have many ideological concerns, such as fear of losing face, fear of being punished, fear of having to return赃款 (ill-gotten gains), etc. A very small number of lawbreakers even obstruct and sabotage this campaign, such as colluding with bribed cadres not to confess, or using despicable means of threat and inducement to prevent others from confessing and reporting. Some heads of industry associations, because they themselves have engaged in bribery, use the excuse that this industry has little contact with government cadres, or that their industry is small, and do not actively lead the masses to carry out the anti-corruption and anti-bribery campaign.
    In view of the above situation, in order to further deepen the anti-corruption and anti-bribery campaign, the Beijing business community must continue to carry out persuasive mobilization universally and deeply, explain the policies of the People's Government, and call on those who have not confessed and those who have not thoroughly confessed to quickly and thoroughly confess in order to strive for lenient treatment from the people. Those who intentionally sabotage or refuse to confess will be punished by the People's judicial organs according to law. As for some heads of trade associations who have engaged in bribery and are passively resisting the campaign, they should quickly correct their erroneous attitude, take the lead in thoroughly confessing and actively reporting facts of corruption and bribery, and conscientiously lead the campaign, otherwise they will inevitably be reported by the masses and sanctioned by the law.

### 北京工商界反贪污反行贿运动普遍展开  坦白检举材料达千九百件  人民司法机关对拒不坦白的人将依法惩办

    北京工商界反贪污反行贿运动普遍展开
    坦白检举材料达千九百件
    人民司法机关对拒不坦白的人将依法惩办
    【本报讯】北京市工商界反贪污反行贿运动现已普遍展开。根据北京市工商业联合会去年年底的不完全统计，全市工商界已召开了大小会议三千多次，共有六万六千多工商业者参加了会议（郊区摊商还不在内）。到今年一月一日为止，全市已收到坦白和检举的材料一千九百多件。目前，北京市工商业联合会正在进一步解除工商业者的思想顾虑，大力动员他们彻底坦白和积极检举一切贪污行贿的事实。
    北京市工商联和它在各区的办事处以及各同业公会，对于反贪污反行贿运动大都很重视。工商联成立了节约检查委员会分会，除已在去年年底连续召开两次动员大会外，所有工商联的委员和工作人员都分工负责，帮助一定行业推动工作。如某行业公会的负责人自己有行贿行为，对运动采取敷衍的态度；经这个公会的职员检举后，节约检查分会的委员便亲自召集这个行业公会的委员、组长和重点户开会，传达彭真市长在市各界人民代表会议上的报告，耐心地进行说服动员，使这个行业的反贪污反行贿运动开展起来。大多数行业公会的负责人，都及时地、反复地召开了委员、组长和全体会员大会，并由委员分工负责召集片会或小组会。在这些会上，许多有行贿行为的行业公会的主任委员和委员都能带头坦白。有些行业由负责人亲自召集重点户开会，或找有行贿嫌疑的工商户个别谈话，动员他们坦白和检举贪污行贿行为，效果很大。经过这样多次的反复的宣传动员后，北京市工商业者已积极行动起来响应反贪污反行贿的号召。许多人并且认识到只有坦白检举才是出路。如某行业公会的副主任委员说：“听了政府处理漏税补税的政策以后，我可放心了。”因此，坦白和检举贪污行贿的工商户已较前增多。
    北京工商界的反贪污反行贿运动的宣传动员工作虽然已作到家喻户晓，已使一般工商业者认识到行贿是可耻的、犯法的行为；但是这一运动仍然不够深入，有许多工商业者还不能勇敢地、彻底地坦白和检举一切贪污行贿事实。在已收到的一千九百多件坦白和检举的材料中，除部分工商业者老老实实地说出了自己的行贿事实以外，还有一部分人对自己的犯罪行为，仍然采取各种不够诚恳不够老实的态度。有的人不承认自己有意拉拢和勾引干部，而强调请干部吃饭、看电影等都是“偶然”的事情。有的人避重就轻，只承认一些小的行贿事实。如汽车材料业某商店老板，最初坦白的都是些小事情，经过这个行业公会的负责人找他谈话后，他才承认行贿在一千五百万元以上。有些人只坦白别人已经知道的和估计别人会检举的事实，其他的则坚决不谈。有些人为了减轻自己的责任，强调是干部主动向他们要回扣，要提高发货票的单价等等，而把自己说成是完全被动的人。还有许多人则根本避免谈他们向干部行贿后已得到的非法利益。
    许多工商业者不能彻底坦白和积极检举，而采取观望等待的态度，是因为他们还有许多思想顾虑，如怕丢面子，怕受处罚，怕追赃款等等。还有极少数的不法分子，甚至阻挠破坏这一运动，如和受贿的干部互相串通不坦白，或者用威胁利诱的卑鄙手段，阻挠别人坦白检举等。还有部分行业公会的负责人因为自己有行贿行为，就藉口这个行业和机关干部接触少，或者说自己的行业小，而不去积极领导群众开展反贪污反行贿运动。
    根据上述情况，为了进一步深入开展反贪污反行贿运动，北京市工商界仍须继续普遍深入地进行说服动员，讲明人民政府的政策，号召没有坦白的和坦白不彻底的人迅速彻底坦白，以争取人民的宽大处理。对于那些存心破坏或拒不坦白的人，人民司法机关将依法惩办。至于某些有行贿行为而对运动消极怠工的同业公会负责人，则应迅速改正自己的错误态度，带头彻底坦白和积极检举贪污行贿事实，并且要认真负责地领导运动的进行，否则就必然会受到群众的检举和法律的制裁。
