    Welcoming the New Tasks and New Victories of 1952
    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
    The year 1951 was a year in which the people's democratic cause in Chinese history achieved unprecedented victories and achievements. It further proved and demonstrated the absolute superiority of our people's democratic system to the people of the world. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, all democratic classes, democratic parties, and ethnic groups across the country victoriously promoted the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. This not only changed the face of the entire country, but also improved the lives and thoughts of the broad masses of the people. The peaceful liberation of Tibet has brought about a people's unity across the Chinese mainland that has never been seen in history. Every achievement of the Chinese people on all fronts has not only greatly consolidated our people's democratic revolutionary regime, but also strengthened the forces of the world's peace and democracy camp, encouraged the struggle of oppressed people around the world for freedom and independence, and strengthened the confidence of peace-loving people around the world in opposing aggression and striving for peace. Therefore, our victory is also the victory of the world's peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. The people of the whole country, in summing up the victories of the past year, will surely realize that our victory was not only obtained through hard struggle, but also could only be achieved under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao; that is to say, the reason why we can achieve one victory after another is because the great Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our path forward.
    The entire membership of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has achieved a certain degree of improvement in ideological understanding through the study and practice of the movements to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, land reform, and suppress counter-revolutionaries, and has played a highly active role in promoting the three major movements and driving the masses with whom they are connected. This is manifested in the donation movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, where comrades have done their best, achieving certain results. In the land reform movement, the comrades who participated in the land reform were generally able to serve the peasants wholeheartedly, abide by discipline under unified leadership, work actively, and gloriously complete their tasks. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, organizations in various places have carried out studies on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and have generally further drawn a clear line between the enemy and ourselves. On the one hand, they actively assisted the government in reporting counter-revolutionary elements, and at the same time resolutely purged politically impure elements who had infiltrated the party, further purifying and consolidating the party's organization. In order to guarantee the completion of the three major political tasks of 1951, party organizations at all levels firmly grasped the organizational policy of combining consolidation and development, and systematically and step-by-step absorbed a batch of new party members, developing the original number of party members by one to two times, and cooperating with the development of various democratic parties to jointly consolidate and expand our great people's democratic united front.
    Through the study and practice of the three major movements in 1951, the ideological and political level of the party comrades has indeed been improved a step further; the organization has also been further consolidated and developed, but we must not be satisfied with this. We still have many shortcomings, and we must take another step forward on the existing basis to meet the new political tasks of 1952. Chairman Mao pointed out in his opening remarks at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "I hope that the people of our country will unite well among themselves, unite well with our Soviet allies, unite well with all people's democratic countries, unite well with all nations and people in the world who sympathize with us, and continue to advance towards the victory of the anti-aggression struggle, the victory of building our great country, and the victory of defending world lasting peace." In order to implement the decision of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on continuing to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, increase production and practice economy, and ideological remolding, the Party Central Committee called on all party comrades to immediately conduct extensive and in-depth publicity among the people of the whole country, especially among the masses connected with the party, and to take active actions to drive the masses with whom they are connected to fight for the promotion and implementation of the three major political tasks under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
    First of all, we must fight to continue to strengthen the resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. In the past year, thanks to the joint combat of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and through arduous and heroic struggles, great victories have been won on the Korean battlefield, forcing the enemy to negotiate with us on the Korean armistice; but it has not truly learned the lessons it should have learned from its defeat. It has not only consistently adopted a policy of obstructing and delaying negotiations, but has also never given up preparing to expand its war of aggression. Therefore, to strive for the realization of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, we must continue to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. From the practice of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea over the past year, party comrades have deeply understood the truth that peace must be striven for and can certainly be striven for. Everyone should participate more actively in various struggles to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea on the basis of existing understanding and work, contribute all their strength to striving for a complete victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and temper themselves in actual struggles, expand contact with the masses, and thereby expand the party's influence among the masses.
    Second, we must strive for increased production and thrift. Increasing production and practicing thrift is not only one of the most basic tasks for us to support the People's Volunteers, but also one of the ways for us to accumulate funds and accelerate the country's industrialization; we must also improve our work, improve efficiency, and establish a good social and personal style of diligence and simplicity through the movement to increase production and practice thrift. However, what seriously hinders the movement to increase production and practice economy at present is corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Therefore, to achieve increased production and practice economy, we must first launch a ruthless struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Not only is there a rather serious bureaucratic work style within the party, but there are also phenomena of waste and corruption. This is worthy of serious vigilance and in-depth inspection by the entire party. Otherwise, we will not be able to undertake the task of promoting the movement to increase production and practice economy well, nor will it be possible to establish the party's due prestige among the people, and especially not to purify and improve the party's organization.
    Third, we must thoroughly carry out ideological remolding. Chairman Mao instructed the people of the whole country at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Ideological remolding, first of all the ideological remolding of various intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reform in all aspects and gradually implement industrialization." Most of the party comrades come from the old society and are intellectuals engaged in political movements. Generally, there are many shortcomings, and they must undergo systematic and thorough ideological remolding in order to better serve the people and become outstanding political cadres of the new era and the new country. Only on the basis of continuous improvement in ideology can we improve the work of our party and complete our political tasks. Therefore, the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee pointed out that ideological remolding is a link for us to implement the three central tasks, which is completely necessary and correct. We have decided to convene the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee in mid-February to further discuss how to implement the three central tasks, and how to conduct systematic ideological remolding within the party and how to help the masses connected with the party to study Mao Zedong Thought will be a central topic of the meeting.
    Looking back on the glorious and brilliant achievements of our great motherland in 1951, and looking forward to the infinitely beautiful future from new democracy to socialism and communism, we have full confidence and determination to strive for greater achievements and victories in 1952. On this victorious New Year's Day in 1952, let us warmly cheer:
    Long live the great People's Republic of China!
    Long live the victory of the great world peace and democracy camp!
    Long live the great Chinese People's Democratic United Front!
    Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

    迎接一九五二年的新任务和新胜利
    中国国民党革命委员会主席  李济深
    一九五一年是中国历史上人民民主事业获得空前的胜利和成就的一年，在全世界人民的面前，更进一步地证明了和显示了我们人民民主制度的绝对优越。全国各民主阶级、各民主党派、各民族在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，胜利地推动抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三大运动，不仅改变了整个国家的面貌，也提高了广大人民群众的生活和思想。西藏的和平解放，使整个中国大陆出现了历史上从来没有过的人民的统一。中国人民在各个战线的每一成就，不仅大大地巩固了我们人民民主的革命政权，同时也加强了世界和平民主阵营的力量，鼓舞了全世界被压迫人民争取自由独立的斗争，坚定了全世界爱好和平人民反对侵略争取和平的信心。所以我们的胜利，也就是以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的胜利。全国人民总结一年来的胜利，一定会认识到：我们的胜利不仅是从艰苦奋斗中得来的，而且只有在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，才可能获致的；也就是说，我们之所以能够一个胜利接着一个胜利，是因为有伟大的毛泽东思想照耀着我们前进的道路。
    中国国民党革命委员会全体党员，在中国共产党领导下，经过抗美援朝运动、土地改革运动、镇压反革命运动的学习和实践，在思想认识上都有一定程度的提高，对于推动三大运动发挥了高度的积极性并带动了所联系的群众。表现在抗美援朝的捐献运动中，同志们都尽了个人的力量，收到一定的成效。表现在土地改革的运动中，参加土地改革的同志们，一般的都能作到全心全意为农民服务，在统一的领导下，遵守纪律，积极工作，光荣地完成了任务。表现在镇压反革命的运动中，各地组织都进行了镇压反革命的学习，一般都进一步地划清了敌我界线，一方面积极协助政府，检举反革命分子，同时坚决清洗了混入党内的政治不纯的分子，进一步地纯洁和巩固了本党的组织。为了保证一九五一年三大政治任务的完成，本党各级组织都紧紧掌握巩固与发展相结合的组织方针，有计划、有步骤地吸收了一批新党员，发展了原有党员一倍到二倍的数量，和各民主党派的发展相配合，共同巩固与扩大了我们伟大的人民民主统一战线。
    通过一九五一年三大运动的学习和实践，本党同志的思想政治水平确已提高一步；组织也获得进一步的巩固和发展，但我们决不能以此满足，我们还存在着许多缺点，必须在现有的基础上，再提高一步来迎接一九五二年新的政治任务。毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议开会词中指出：“我希望我国人民好好地自己团结一致，并好好地和我们的苏联盟友团结一致，好好地和一切人民民主国家团结一致，好好地和世界上一切同情我们的民族和人民团结一致，向着争取反侵略斗争的胜利、向着建设我们伟大国家的胜利、向着保卫世界持久和平的胜利而继续前进。”本党中央为了贯彻执行人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议关于继续抗美援朝、增产节约、思想改造三大中心任务的决定，曾号召全党同志立即向全国人民，特别是在本党所联系的群众中，进行广泛深入的宣传，更要积极的行动起来，带动所联系的群众，在中国共产党领导下，为推动和贯彻三大政治任务而奋斗。
    首先，我们要为继续加强抗美援朝而斗争。一年来由于中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，经过艰苦而英勇的斗争，在朝鲜战场上赢得了伟大的胜利，迫使敌人不得不与我们进行朝鲜停战的谈判；但它并没有真正从失败中取得应有的教训，不但一贯地采取阻挠和拖延谈判的政策，同时更从来没有放弃扩大侵略战争的准备。因此，我们要争取和平解决朝鲜问题的实现，必须继续加强抗美援朝运动。从一年来抗美援朝运动的实践中，本党同志已深刻认识和平必须争取而且一定可以争取得到的真理，大家应该在已有的认识和工作基础上，更积极地参加抗美援朝各种斗争，为争取抗美援朝的彻底胜利而贡献出自己的一切力量，并在实际斗争中锻炼自己，扩大与群众的联系，从而扩大本党在群众中的影响。
    第二，要为增产节约而奋斗。增产节约不仅是我们支援人民志愿军最基本的工作之一，而且也是我们积累资金，加速国家工业化的方法之一；我们并且要通过增产节约运动来改进工作，提高效能，树立社会和个人勤劳朴实的优良作风。但当前严重阻碍增产节约运动的便是贪污浪费和官僚主义，所以我们要做到增产节约，首先便要与贪污浪费和官僚主义展开无情的斗争。本党不仅存在着相当严重的官僚主义作风，而且存在着浪费和贪污现象。这是值得我们全党严重警惕和深入检查的。否则，我们即不能很好担当起推动增产节约运动的任务，也就不可能在人民群众中树立本党应有的威信，而尤其不能纯洁和提高本党的组织。
    第三，要彻底地进行思想改造。毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议指示全国人民：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”本党同志大多数都是来自旧社会而从事政治运动的知识分子，一般地都存在着许多的缺点，必须经过有系统的、彻底的思想改造，才能更好地为人民服务，成为新时代新国家的优秀政治干部，也唯有在思想不断提高的基础上，才能改善我们党的工作，完成我们的政治任务。所以中央常务委员会扩大会议指出思想改造为我们贯彻执行三项中心任务的环节，这是完全必要的和正确的。我们已决定在二月中旬召开二届三中全会，进一步讨论如何贯彻执行三项中心任务，而如何在全党范围内进行有系统的思想改造以及如何帮助所联系的群众学习毛泽东思想，更将是会议的一个中心议题。
    回顾我们伟大祖国在一九五一年光辉灿烂的成就，瞻望从新民主主义到社会主义和共产主义无限美好的将来，使我们有着充分的信心和决心在一九五二年争取更伟大的成就和胜利。在胜利的一九五二年元旦，让我们热烈欢呼：
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的世界和平民主阵营胜利万岁！
    伟大的中国人民民主统一战线万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
