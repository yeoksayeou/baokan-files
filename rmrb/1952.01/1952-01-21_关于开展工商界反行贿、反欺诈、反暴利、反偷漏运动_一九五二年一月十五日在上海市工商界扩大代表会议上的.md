Regarding the Launch of the Anti-Bribery, Anti-Fraud, Anti-Profiteering, and Anti-Tax Evasion Movement in the Business and Industrial Sectors
——Opening Speech at the Enlarged Meeting of Representatives of the Shanghai Business and Industrial Community on January 15, 1952
Sheng Pihua

Fellow Representatives, esteemed Colleagues:

Today, the Shanghai business and industrial community is convening this enlarged meeting of representatives to discuss how to carry out the anti-bribery, anti-fraud, anti-profiteering, and anti-tax evasion movement within our sector. We hope that through this meeting, the Shanghai business and industrial community will clearly recognize the fundamental significance of this great movement and, furthermore, take concrete actions to ensure its decisive victory.

(I) Implement the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, Oppose Corruption,
Oppose Waste, Oppose Bureaucracy

Chairman Mao instructed us at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to "increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." To achieve a greater victory in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, we must do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy. Our country aims to complete the main preparations for large-scale economic construction in 1952, and this key preparation is none other than increasing production and practicing economy. Therefore, increasing production and practicing economy is our most important central task in 1952. Today, as the Shanghai business and industrial community holds this enlarged meeting of representatives in 1952, we should deeply recognize this crucial central task and work together to complete this glorious and great mission!

The purpose of increasing production and practicing economy is to unleash all possible forces and save all possible resources to supply the needs of resisting America and aiding Korea and economic construction. Corruption and waste, on the other hand, are the opposite; they are stealing and consuming the property of the state and the people. Corruption is a shameful, hidden, and illegal act of theft; waste is an "unashamed" open act of theft. Both are detrimental to the property of the state and the people. Mayor Chen Yi has stated very clearly at the Second Session of the Third Municipal People's Congress: The wealth we painstakingly generate through increased production and practicing economy is being stolen by corrupt elements and squandered by wasteful individuals. If corrupt and wasteful elements exist, who would be willing to work hard to increase production and practice economy? Corruption and waste are the enemies of increasing production and practicing economy, and bureaucracy is the breeding ground for corruption and waste, the haven for corruption and waste. Therefore, the movement to oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy is a necessary step for increasing production and practicing economy.

Increasing production and practicing economy, opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy are the most important central tasks for every class, every department, and every individual in 1952. It is a nationwide, widespread, and in-depth mass movement. It is by no means an individual issue for a particular government agency, a particular state-owned enterprise, or a particular private enterprise, but a major task for all the people of the country. It is particularly deeply related to our business and industrial sector. Our business and industrial sector should not and cannot stand idly by. We must enthusiastically engage in this movement, closely coordinate with other sectors, and ensure that this historically significant movement achieves a comprehensive and thorough victory. Our business and industrial sector must vigorously and swiftly fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy!

(II) The "Three-Anti" Movement is a
Serious Struggle

Opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy is a serious ideological and political struggle! We must not be timid or hesitant; we must actively and proactively adopt a fighting stance and participate in this intense struggle!

In the past, we suffered greatly under reactionary rule. We experienced the extortion and oppression of reactionary bureaucrats. We deeply resented the dark politics of the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, our country has an unprecedentedly honest People's Government. Under the wise leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government wholeheartedly serves the people. This is an undeniable fact that we all recognize. In the past two years, all undertakings have achieved remarkable and great successes. Our country has gained an unprecedentedly high position internationally. We believe that our motherland will become stronger and more prosperous day by day. However, corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are the termites that erode our country and harm our people. If they are not cleared and eliminated in time and are allowed to grow and spread, they will inevitably hinder the development of our country and greatly damage the interests of the people.

Fellow Representatives, esteemed Colleagues: What is the ideological root of these corrupt behaviors and undesirable practices? It is precisely the selfish and self-serving ideology of the bourgeoisie, seeking profit at the expense of others and engaging in speculation and trickery. As manifested in our business and industrial sector, to achieve selfish gains, people engage in wining and dining, gift-giving, and even bribery. To achieve selfish gains, people resort to fraud, using various deceptive methods to steal state assets when conducting transactions with the state. When undertaking processing, orders, or construction projects entrusted by the state, they cut corners, use inferior materials, and pass off cheap goods as expensive ones, and bad goods as good ones. To achieve selfish gains, they hoard goods to speculate and obtain excessive profits by exceeding negotiated prices or state-regulated limits. To achieve selfish gains, they evade and underpay taxes. The corruption cases of Lu Xingyuan, Wang Canwen, and others are inseparable from the bribery and collusion of illegal merchants. These bad behaviors, bad habits, and bad practices stemming from the selfish and self-serving bourgeois ideology erode the working cadres of government agencies, undermine the purity of the revolutionary ranks, and harm state property. Furthermore, some members of the business and industrial community still lead extravagant, wasteful, and decadent lives after liberation. This bad atmosphere spreads, psychologically and spiritually tempting and invading hard-working and thrifty cadres, indirectly causing their corruption, waste, and extravagance.

We in the business and industrial community often pride ourselves on the revolutionary nature of the national bourgeoisie. Yes, we are revolutionary, and that is why we are members of the people's democratic united front.

However, our business and industrial community must understand that this revolutionary nature is indeed limited and cannot be compared to the spirit of the working class and peasantry, who shed blood and sweat and unswervingly fight for the revolution to the end. Therefore, we must never become complacent about our limited revolutionary nature. On the other hand, in the two years since liberation, the transformation of the business and industrial community’s bad thoughts, bad habits, and bad practices has clearly been insufficient. On the contrary, with the improvement of the economic situation, these bad thoughts, bad habits, and bad practices have rapidly grown, which is something that our business and industrial community should be greatly vigilant about.

Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai pointed out clearly at the Standing Committee Meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Today's Chinese national bourgeoisie has its positive and progressive side, which is that because they have long been oppressed by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, some of their representatives participated in or sympathized with the people's liberation struggle to a certain extent and during a certain period. After liberation, they gradually participated in the construction of the people's China and played a certain positive role under the leadership of the state. However, the Chinese national bourgeoisie also has its dark and corrupt side, which is that because they have inextricable links with the imperialist, feudal, and bureaucrat-comprador economy, and at the same time, the Chinese bourgeoisie itself, like the bourgeoisie of all countries in the world, has the essence of seeking profit, harming others for self-interest, and engaging in speculation and trickery. Therefore, after liberation, many of them, as the Tianjin business and industrial community themselves have exposed, often steal state property, harm the interests of the people, and corrupt state personnel through illegal acts such as bribery, fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion to satisfy the private interests of a few. If this situation is not attacked and eradicated, and is allowed to develop, then our revolutionary parties, the People's Government, the People's Army, and the People's organizations will be increasingly eroded by the bourgeoisie, and their future will be unimaginable." This instruction is entirely correct. Our business and industrial community should thoroughly eliminate and transform this dark and corrupt side through the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

(III) To Implement the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste,
and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement, We Should Do a Good Job in Anti-Bribery,
Anti-Fraud, Anti-Profiteering, and Anti-Tax
Evasion Work

We recognize the seriousness of the harm that corruption, waste, and bureaucracy pose to the interests of the state and the people, and we also recognize that all acts of bribery, fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion by the dark and corrupt elements of the Chinese national bourgeoisie are equally serious in harming the interests of the state and the people. Therefore, our business and industrial community must vigorously and swiftly launch a struggle against bribery, fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion to implement the nationwide, vigorous anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

Fellow Representatives, esteemed Colleagues: Opposing corruption, opposing waste, opposing bureaucracy, as well as our business and industrial community's opposition to bribery, fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion, are precisely for implementing the Common Program.

Article 18 of the Common Program stipulates that all state organs of the People's Republic of China must rigorously practice a clean, simple, and people-serving revolutionary work style, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose bureaucratic work styles that are detached from the masses of the people. This is the clear basis in the Common Program for the Three-Anti Movement. Since we must rigorously practice integrity and severely punish corruption, we should not tolerate bribery. Bribery undermines integrity and leads to corruption, so we must oppose bribery. Article 8 of the Common Program stipulates that all citizens of the People's Republic of China have the obligation to defend the motherland, abide by the law, observe labor discipline, protect public property, respond to conscription for labor and military service, and pay taxes. Fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion violate the law, harm public property, and erode fiscal revenue, so we must oppose fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion. The Common Program is a solemn agreement that should be jointly observed by all the people of the country. It safeguards our business and industrial community's legitimate enterprises, legal status, and economic interests. Bribery, fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion seriously violate the Common Program. How can we not launch a fierce struggle against such behaviors!

In the past, during the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, bribery was a common tactic for many businesses and industrialists to conduct business. Those with more connections and those who could get bribes through were considered successful in making money. Those who could speculate, take advantage of the situation, and make more money were considered capable. Those who could exploit loopholes and evade taxes were considered highly skilled. These actions were never considered shameful, so business expansion was also achieved through open commissions. This is because the essence of capitalism and reactionary rule is to pursue profits by any means, starting from private interests. However, now is the era of the people, a New Democratic state. Individual interests must be subordinate to the interests of the masses of the people. Anyone who infringes on the interests of the people is committing a crime against the people and will be abandoned by the people. Is there anyone in our business and industrial community who wants to be abandoned by the people? If not, then we should take this critical moment, this fleeting opportunity, to clearly draw a line in the sand by distinguishing right from wrong. For the sake of the country, for the sake of the people, and for the sake of ourselves, we all have the need to take immediate action!

Therefore, we specifically call on all patriotic industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai to unite and act! Immediately launch a vigorous patriotic movement against bribery, fraud, profiteering, and tax evasion, and actively and resolutely participate in this movement. Every patriotic industrialist and businessman should clearly express their attitude in this movement and accept the test of this movement. Only in this way can all legitimate industrialists and businessmen draw a clear line between themselves and illegal merchants. Only in this way can we consolidate the unity of our legitimate industrialists and businessmen. Only in this way can we further consolidate the mutual unity of the four classes. And only in this way can we, under the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, work together to develop the country's economic construction plan!

(IV) Eliminate Ideological Concerns, Be Brave
and Honest, and Boldly Expose

Director Bo Yibo has clearly stated: "Industrialists and businessmen who have committed illegal acts should truthfully confess to the government, publicly declare remorse, and guarantee that the same mistakes will not occur in the future. For industrialists and businessmen who have committed illegal acts, except for those who have committed heinous crimes, those who can automatically and thoroughly confess can be given leniency or exemption from punishment depending on the circumstances. All acts of tax evasion must be stopped. Those who have evaded taxes should pay the amount owed, and those who do not confess will not only have to pay the amount owed but will also be punished." This demonstrates the government's policy of combining punishment with education, and it also provides an opportunity for self-renewal for many industrialists and businessmen who have already made mistakes.

However, some industrialists and businessmen may still have concerns about losing face and suffering economic losses if they confess. These concerns are entirely superfluous and should not exist. Regarding the so-called "face" issue, frankly speaking, temporarily maintaining face through concealment is a paper-thin facade. Once exposed, there will be even less face. Only by bravely confessing can one restore face on the basis of self-renewal. Are you afraid of suffering economic losses? Since your actions have caused losses to the state and the people, thereby obtaining illegitimate gains, it is only natural to return these illegitimate gains to the people. We demand severe punishment for those who steal our own property, and the crime of stealing state and people's property is far greater than ordinary theft. Shouldn't it be punished even more severely? Therefore, only by automatically confessing can one reduce the crimes committed against the state and the people and seek the forgiveness of the people!

As for knowing that someone has committed corruption or bribery but not reporting it, this is being irresponsible to the state and the people, which means abandoning the people's standpoint. Because corrupt elements, or illegal merchants who steal state property through tax evasion, bribery, and other methods, are enemies of national construction. If we know about it and do not report it, we are protecting illegal merchants and harming our national construction. If these illegal elements are our own relatives and friends, we should quickly encourage these relatives and friends to confess automatically so that they can be spared from destruction and start anew. If they refuse to confess, then we should draw a clear line and report them in a timely manner. This is precisely the principle of "being kind to people and curing diseases and saving lives."

We must know that the people of the whole country are already filled with anger towards these enemies who endanger our national construction. If we do not resolve to confess and repent, these illegal elements will inevitably be reported and subjected to legal sanctions. Tianjin is the best example: within five days, employees have reported more than 9,000 cases. Not only will the employees' union report, but also their own wives, children, and all relatives and friends will report. Moreover, these corrupt elements certainly do not only commit one case. Even if things are temporarily concealed, they will be exposed in other cases. In short, "If you don't want others to know, don't do it in the first place."

Fellow Representatives, esteemed Colleagues: Please tell your colleagues and friends in various enterprises that for those industrialists and businessmen who have already made mistakes, this is an opportunity to cure their own problems. Once the problem is cured, they will still be a healthy person. They must not let go of this opportunity. I hope that everyone will encourage each other, conduct in-depth investigations, make public self-criticisms, and strive to take the initiative. Everyone must understand that confessing and repenting, and exposing one's own shortcomings is an upright behavior. Courageously correcting mistakes is a glorious act. Confessing is better than not confessing, confessing early is better than confessing late, confessing everything is better than confessing partially, and confessing automatically is better than confessing passively. The government will definitely reduce the sentence for serious crimes and exempt the sentence for minor crimes for all those who confess.

All industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai, take action and fight for the victory of the anti-bribery, anti-fraud, anti-profiteering, and anti-tax evasion movement!

    关于开展工商界反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动
    ——一九五二年一月十五日在上海市工商界扩大代表会议上的开会词
    盛丕华
    各位代表，各位先生：
    今天是上海市工商界为了怎样开展工商界的反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动而召开的工商界代表扩大会议。我们希望通过这次会议，使上海工商界能明确认识这一伟大运动的基本意义，而且用具体行动，使这一运动得到决定的胜利。
    （一）贯彻增产节约、反对贪污、
    反对浪费、反对官僚主义
    毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上指示我们“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”，我们要使抗美援朝的斗争获得更大的胜利，我们必须把增产节约做好。我们国家要在一九五二年完成进行大规模经济建设的主要准备，而这个主要准备，也就是增产节约。所以，增产节约是我们在一九五二年的最重要的中心任务。在一九五二年上海工商界举行代表扩大会议的今天，我们应该对这个最重要的中心任务，有深切的认识，并应该共同为完成这个光荣伟大的中心任务而努力！
    增产节约的目的是要发挥一切可以发挥的力量，节省一切可能节省的力量，来供应抗美援朝和经济建设的需要，而贪污、浪费，正与此相反，它是盗窃和耗费国家人民财产的。贪污是可耻的、隐蔽的、非法的盗窃行为；浪费是“不以为耻”的公开的盗窃行为；它们都是国家和人民财产的损害者。陈毅市长在二届三次人代会上，已经说得非常明白：我们辛辛苦苦增产节约得来的财富，都被贪污分子盗窃去了，被浪费分子随便化掉了，贪污浪费分子存在，还有谁愿意辛辛苦苦来增产节约呢？贪污浪费是增产节约的敌人，而官僚主义又是贪污浪费的温床，是贪污浪费的庇护所，所以，反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动，乃是增产节约的必要步骤。
    增产节约，反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义既是一九五二年每一阶层、每一部门、每一个人的最重要的中心任务，就是一个全国规模的普遍的深入的群众运动，决不是某一个政府机关，某一个国营企业，或某一个私营企业的个别问题，而是全国人民人人有份的重大任务。尤其与我们工商界关系特别深切。我们工商界决不应也不能袖手旁观置身事外，我们必须热烈地投入这一个运动，与其他方面密切的配合，使这一伟大历史意义的运动能得到全面的彻底的胜利，我们工商界必须大张旗鼓雷厉风行地为反贪污反浪费反官僚主义而奋斗！
    （二）“三反”运动是一场
    严重的斗争
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义，是一场严重的思想斗争、政治斗争！我们大家切勿畏首畏尾，拖泥带水，必须积极地、主动地采取战斗姿态，参加这一猛烈的斗争！
    我们过去是受尽反动统治的痛苦的，我们过去是备尝反动官僚的敲诈压迫的，我们过去对于国民党反动派的黑暗政治，感到深恶痛绝。在解放以后，我们的国家有了一个历史上空前未有的廉洁的人民政府，人民政府在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党英明领导之下，全心全意地为人民服务，这是我们大家所公认的铁的事实。两年多以来，一切设施，有显著的伟大的成绩，我们的国家，在国际上获得了前所未有的崇高地位，我们相信：我们的祖国，一天比一天更强盛，一天比一天更繁荣。但是贪污、浪费、官僚主义，却是腐蚀我们国家的、危害我们人民的蛀虫，如果不及时的加以肃清，加以消灭，任其滋长蔓延，必然会妨害我们国家的发展，必然会大大地损害人民的利益。
    各位代表，各位先生：贪污、浪费、官僚主义，这些恶劣行为、恶劣作风，它的思想根源是什么？正是资产阶级唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的自私自利思想。表现在我们工商界方面，为了要达到自私自利的目的，所以会请客、送礼拉拢乃至行贿；为了要达到自私自利的目的，所以要欺诈，和国家进行交易时，用各种欺骗方法，盗窃国家资财；在承受国家委托加工，承受定货或承受修建工程时，偷工减料，以贱报贵，以坏作好；为了要达到自私自利，所以要囤积居奇，要超越议价，或国家规定的限度来取得暴利，为了要达到自私自利，所以要偷漏税款。路星元、王灿文等贪污案件，都是和不法商人的行贿勾结分不开的。这些自私自利的资产阶级坏思想所表现出来的坏行为、坏习惯、坏作风，侵蚀到政府机关的工作干部，破坏了革命队伍的纯洁，损害了国家的财产。还有部分的工商界人士，在解放以后，仍旧过着奢侈浪费腐化堕落的生活，这种恶劣的风气，传播开来，也使勤劳朴素的工作干部，受了心理上、精神上的引诱和侵袭，间接造成他们的贪污腐化、铺张浪费。
    我们工商界常常以民族资产阶级有其革命性来自负，不错，我们是有革命性的，亦因此我们成为人民民主统一战线成员之一。
    但是，我们工商界必须明白，这革命性实在是有限度的，不能和工人阶级、农民阶级流血流汗毫不动摇的为革命奋斗到底的精神相比。所以，我们这点有限的革命性，绝不可在心理上有自满的情绪，而在另一方面，解放两年多，工商界的坏思想、坏习惯、坏作风，显然改造得很不够，相反的，跟着经济情况的好转，这些坏思想、坏习惯、坏作风迅速地滋长起来，这真是值得我们工商界大大警惕的。
    周恩来副主席在人民政协全国委员会常委会议上，曾明白地指出：“今天的中国民族资产阶级，有其积极进步的一面，那就是由于他们长期受过帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫，因此，他们中间一部分代表人物，在一定时期，一定程度上参加过或同情过人民解放斗争，解放后，他们逐渐参加了人民中国的建设，并在国家的领导下，发挥着一定的积极作用；但是中国民族资产阶级还有其黑暗腐朽的一面，那就是由于他们与帝国主义的、封建的、官僚买办的经济有着千丝万缕的联系，同时，中国资产阶级本身也同世界各国的资产阶级一样，具有唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的本质，因此，解放后，他们中间有很多人，正如天津工商界自己所检举的，常常以行贿、欺诈、暴利、偷漏等犯法行为，盗窃国家财产，危害人民利益，腐蚀国家工作人员，以遂其少数人的私利。这种情形如果不加以打击和铲除，而任其发展下去，则我们革命党派、人民政府、人民军队、人民团体日益受着资产阶级的侵蚀，其前途将不堪设想。”这个指示是十分正确的，我们工商界应该对这黑暗腐朽的一面，从反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中，加以彻底的肃清，加以彻底的改造。（三）贯彻反贪污、反浪费、
    反官僚主义运动应做好反行
    贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷
    漏工作
    我们认识了贪污浪费官僚主义对于国家人民利益为害的严重性，又认清了中国民族资产阶级黑暗腐朽方面的一切行贿、欺诈、暴利、偷漏的行为，同样是严重地危害了国家人民的利益，因此，我们工商界必须大张旗鼓地雷厉风行地开展反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏的斗争，来贯彻全国范围轰轰烈烈的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。
    各位代表、各位先生：反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义以及我们工商界的反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏，正是为了贯彻共同纲领。
    共同纲领第十八条规定，中华人民共和国的一切国家机关，必须厉行廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风。这就是三反运动在共同纲领上所明白规定的依据。既要厉行廉洁，严惩贪污，就不应该容忍有行贿的人；行贿是破坏廉洁的，是诱致贪污的，所以我们要反行贿。共同纲领第八条规定，中华人民共和国国民均有保卫祖国、遵守法律、遵守劳动纪律、爱护公共财产、应征工役兵役和缴纳赋税的义务。欺诈、暴利、偷漏是违反法律、损害公共财产、侵蚀财政收入的，所以我们要反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏。共同纲领，是我们全国人民所应共同遵守的庄严信约，我们工商界赖以保障了我们的正当企业、合法地位和经济利益；而行贿、欺诈、暴利、偷漏是严重地违反共同纲领的，我们怎能不对这种行为展开剧烈的斗争！
    过去，在蒋匪帮反动统治时期，行贿是许多工商家做生意买卖的通常手法，谁路子多，谁能将贿赂送得进，谁就是生财有道，谁能投机取巧，混水捞鱼，多赚钱，谁就是能手；谁能钻空子，偷漏税款，谁就是本领高妙；这些行动，从来没有认为是可耻的，所以推广业务，也是用公开回佣的方法来取得，因为资本主义和反动统治的本质，就是以私人利益为出发点，可以不择手段来追求利润，但是现在是人民世纪，是新民主主义的国家，个人的利益，必须服从人民大众的利益，谁侵害人民的利益，就对人民犯了罪，就为人民所共弃，我们工商界中有那
    一位愿意为人民所共弃呢？既是不愿，那末就应该在这个紧要关头，在这个稍纵即逝的时机，来清清楚楚地从分辨是非中划清界限。我们为了国家，为了人民，为了自己，都有立刻行动的必要！
    为此，我们特地号召全上海爱国的工商业家，一致行动起来！立刻开展一个轰轰烈烈的反对行贿、反对欺诈、反对暴利、反对偷漏的爱国运动，并积极地坚决地参加到这个运动中去。我们每一个爱国的工商业者，都应该在这个运动中，明确地表示自己的态度，并接受这个运动的考验。只有这样，一切正当的工商业者，才能和不法的商人划清界限。只有这样，才能巩固我们正当工商业者的团结。只有这样，才能进一步巩固四大阶级的相互团结。也只有这样，才能在毛主席和中央人民政府英明正确的领导下，大家一致努力来开展国家的经济建设计划！（四）消除思想顾虑，勇敢
    坦白，大胆检举
    薄一波主任已经明白昭示：有“犯法行为的工商业者，应当据实向政府坦白，公开声明悔过，保证以后不再发生同样的错误。政府对于犯法的工商业者，除罪大恶极者外，凡能自动彻底坦白的，也可以视情况酌予减罪或免罪。一切偷税漏税的行为，必须制止。已偷漏者应补缴，不坦白者补缴之外，并应受罚。”这是表示政府惩办与教育相结合的政策，也正是给许多业已犯了错误的工商业者以自新的机会。
    但是工商业者中对于自动坦白，或者还有丧失面子及经济损失的顾虑。这些顾虑实在是多余的，也是不应该有的。所谓“面子”问题，老实说，暂时用隐瞒的手段来维持面子，这面子是纸糊的，一旦被人戳穿了，更没有面子，只有自己勇敢的坦白出来，才能在自新的基础上恢复面子。怕受经济损失么？既然自己的行为使国家人民受到损失，从而得到了非份的利益，那么将这非份的利益缴出来还给人民，是理所当然的。我们对于自己的财物被人偷窃，尚且要求严厉处罚，现在对盗窃国家人民财产的行为，其罪恶远超过普通的偷窃，岂不更应该严厉处罚吗？因此，只有自动坦白才能减轻自己对国家人民所犯的罪恶，求得人民的宽恕！
    至于知道有人贪污或者行贿等行为，不去检举，这就是对国家人民不负责任，也就是丧失了人民的立场，因为贪污分子，或者用偷漏、行贿等方法来盗窃国家财产的非法商人，都是国家建设的敌人，我们知道了而不检举，就是庇护不法商人，来危害我们国家的建设，这些不法分子，若是我们自己的亲戚朋友，我们更应该迅速鼓励这些亲友自动坦白，使其免于毁灭重新作人，如其拒不坦白，那么就该划清界限及时检举，这正是“与人为善、治病救人”的道理。
    我们必须知道对这些危害我们国家建设的敌人，全国人民已经充满愤怒，如果自己不下决心坦白悔过，这些不法分子势将受到检举，而遭受法律制裁。天津是最好的例子：五天之内，职工检举的已有九千多件案子，不但职工会检举，就是自己的妻子儿女，一切亲友也都会检举，何况这些贪污分子，决不是光搞一件案子，即使事情暂时隐瞒过去，但在别的案子上也会败露出来。总而言之，“若要人不知，除非己莫为。”
    各位代表，各位先生：请大家转告同业，转告各企业的朋友，凡是已经犯了错误的工商业者，这是医治自己毛病的机会，毛病医好了，仍然是个康健的人，再不能放过这一个机会了。我希望大家相互鼓励，深入检查，公开检讨，争取主动，大家必须明白，坦白悔过，暴露自己的缺点是光明磊落的行为，勇于改正错误，是光荣的举动，坦白比不坦白好，早坦白比迟坦白好，全部坦白比局部坦白好，自动坦白比被动坦白好，政府对于一切坦白的人，一定会重罪减轻，轻罪减免。
    全上海工商业家们，行动起来，为争取反行贿、反欺诈、反暴利、反偷漏运动的胜利而斗争！
