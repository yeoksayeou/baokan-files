Love and Protect Cultural Relics
    Wu Han

    Beijing, our capital, is a densely populated area with a history of more than two thousand five hundred or even three thousand years, and an ancient capital city with a history of eight hundred years (if calculated from the time when King Hailing of the Jin Dynasty established his capital in Yanjing in the first year of Zhenyuan—1153 AD—it is now seven hundred and ninety-nine years. If calculated from the time when Emperor Taizong of the Liao Dynasty elevated Youzhou to Nanjing in the first year of Huitong—938 AD—it would be one thousand and twelve years). And today, it has gloriously become the capital of our People's Republic of China.

    A long history has nurtured and cultivated a beautiful culture. Our ancestors—the industrious, brave, and wise Chinese people—have continuously used creative labor to leave behind immortal masterpieces of cultural art here. Historical and artistically valuable cultural relics are everywhere above ground, and many have been discovered underground, with more undoubtedly waiting to be excavated.

    All historical relics, both above and below ground, discovered and yet to be discovered, are the most precious cultural heritage created by the labor of our great and industrious ancestors. Through these physical objects, with systematic explanations and scientific displays, we will inevitably feel concretely how our great ancestors carried out production, how they improved technology, enhanced the quality of production, how they built dwellings, utensils, created culture, villages and cities, and even the establishment of capitals—the process of social development over thousands of years, thereby strengthening our love for the capital, our love for the great motherland, and our love for the history of struggle of our own ancestors.

    Our Central People's Government highly values these cultural heritages. In the past two years, the Government Administration Council has issued many instructions on the protection of cultural relics and historical sites. The Beijing Municipal People's Government, in implementing the instructions of the Central Government, has done some work in the past with the close cooperation of various cultural relics institutions in the city, especially the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, focusing on repairing some ancient buildings above ground, systematically excavating some ancient tombs, and beginning to sort out a batch of cultural relics. In July last year, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Municipal People's Government established a cultural relics investigation team, which is now carrying out the compilation of documentary cultural relics cards and key field investigations.

    We ask all the people of the city, all levels of government agencies, troops, and people's organizations in the city to work with us to love and protect cultural relics. This means that the cultural relics remaining above ground must be kept intact; those with particular historical and artistic value should be cared for even more carefully. Once cultural relics buried underground are discovered, they should be immediately reported to the cultural relics investigation team for scientific and timely handling.

    At the same time, it should also be pointed out that our work of sorting out cultural relics must be carried out in coordination with the capital's municipal construction. On the one hand, Beijing is an ancient cultural city, and some historical and artistic cultural relics of definite value must be sorted out and preserved in a planned and differentiated manner, especially with a focus on key areas. On the other hand, we must also recognize that Beijing is today the capital of the new China, and the capital of 500 million people must be built into a modern and beautiful city. Large-scale construction work is about to begin. Some general and common buildings should not and cannot be completely preserved. We must remove the shackles of development, and we must oppose the vulgar view of comprehensively preserving cultural relics without principle or focus.

    In the process of building the people's capital, underground treasures will be discovered one after another, and the labor achievements of our ancestors will be completely restored to become the wealth of our country. Let us work together to build the new capital, love and protect the historically significant old cultural relics, and prepare to establish the Beijing People's History Museum to commemorate the great day of October 1, 1949, when Beijing was declared the capital!

    爱护文物保卫文物

    北京，我们的首都，是具有二千五百多年以至三千年历史的人口聚居地区，是具有八百年历史（假如从金海陵王贞元元年——公元一一五三年——奠都燕京算起，到现在是七百九十九年。假如从辽太宗会同元年——公元九三八年——升幽州为南京算起，应该是一千零十二年。）的古老都城。而今天，则已光荣地成为我们中华人民共和国的首都。
    悠久的历史，孕育了并滋长了优美的文化。我们的祖先——勤劳、勇敢、智慧的中国人民，不断地用创造性的劳动，在这里留下了文化艺术的不朽杰作。地面上具有历史的艺术价值的文物到处都是，埋藏在地下的，发见的已经很多，尚待发掘的必然更多。
    所有地上和地下，已发见和尚待发掘的历史文物，都是我们伟大的勤劳的祖先劳动创造的最可贵的文化遗产。通过这些实物，加以系统的说明，科学的陈列，必然会使我们具体地感触到：我们伟大的祖先如何进行生产，如何改进技术，提高生产质量，如何建立居室、用具、创造文化、村落和城市，以至都城的建立，——几千年来社会发展的过程，而更加强了我们对首都的热爱，对伟大祖国的热爱，对我们自己祖先斗争历史的热爱。
    我们的中央人民政府是十分珍视这些文化遗产的。两年以来，政务院曾经多次发布关于保护文物古迹的指示。北京市人民政府执行中央的指示，过去在本市各级文物机构，特别是文化部文物局的紧密配合下，做了一些工作，有重点地修葺了一些地上的古建筑，有计划地发掘了一些古墓葬，开始着手整理了一批文物。去年七月间，市人民政府文化教育委员会增设了文物调查组，现在进行文献的文物卡片编制和重点的实地调查工作。
    我们要求全市人民，全市各级政府机构、部队、各人民团体，和我们一起，来进行爱护文物、保卫文物的工作。这就是留存在地面上的文物要保持其完整；特别有历史艺术价值的，更应加意爱护。埋藏在地下的文物，一经发见，应立即报告文物调查组，加以科学的及时的处理。
    同时，也应该指出：我们的文物整理工作，必须和首都的市政建设配合进行。一方面，北京是文化古城，对某些确有价值的历史的艺术的文物，必须有计划有分别地、特别是应该有重点地加以整理和保存。另一方面，我们也必须认识到：北京今天是新中国的首都，五万万人民的首都必须建立为现代化的美丽都市，大规模的兴建工作，即将展开。对于某一些一般性的通常建筑，是不应该而且也不可能完全加以保存的，必须去掉发展的桎梏，必须反对那种无原则无重点的全面保存文物的庸俗看法。
    在人民首都的建设过程中，地下的宝藏必将陆续发见，我们祖先的劳动成果，必然会完整地重新成为我们国家的财富。让我们一起来建设新首都，爱护和保卫有历史意义的旧文物，筹备建立北京市人民历史博物馆来纪念一九四九年十月一日宣布以北京为首都这一伟大的日子吧！
