We Must Labor for a More Prosperous and Powerful Motherland
Industrial Labor Model Jiang Wanshou

    Our motherland has been liberated for more than two years. Under the leadership of our beloved leader Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are displaying great wisdom to build our motherland and make it prosperous and strong. Every one of our people has also received warmth and happiness on the road to the prosperity and strength of the motherland.

    On the "May 1st" International Labor Day in 1951, I was honored to go to the Soviet Union to attend the "May 1st International Labor Day" parade. In Red Square in Moscow, just as the marching Soviet people passed the reviewing stand and reached our delegation, the representatives of various countries watching the ceremony and the marching people shouted in Chinese, "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" This huge wave of sound radiated from Red Square in Moscow to the distance.

    In June of this year, the German people held a "German-Chinese Friendship Month" throughout the country. During this month, people in various cities and villages studied the rich struggle experience of our motherland's people. When our delegation went to various cities to give reports, we were surrounded by the German people many times, asking us to report on the struggle experience of the Chinese people. They regarded seeing the Chinese people as a very honorable thing.

    The overseas Chinese in Germany told me very emotionally: "Compatriots in the motherland, our situation has changed greatly now, and the eyes that discriminate against us are gone forever!" The overseas Chinese in remote places also felt the warmth given by the motherland. Our motherland's international status has been greatly improved, and the honor of our motherland's people has spread all over the world. This is the result of our people's struggle and victory under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    In the two years since the liberation of the motherland, we have not only defeated and repelled the aggressive actions of American imperialism, but also made brilliant achievements in economic recovery and construction. Even when the motherland's economy was still very difficult, it made amazing achievements in improving the people's lives, such as the huge project to harness the Huai River, which is already underway.

    Our factory built a large dormitory and a canteen that can accommodate nearly a thousand people in 1951. Trackless trolleybuses also appeared in Shenyang in 1951. The wages of our workers have generally increased by 15 percent. These new atmospheres can be seen all over the country.

    Many workers and outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland have been promoted to leadership positions in various construction tasks of the motherland, and I am one of them. A few years ago, I was still a worker looked down upon by the old society. Now, under the education of the Party and the motherland, I have taken on the job of deputy director.

    Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "All the facts prove that our system of people's democratic dictatorship has a great superiority over the political systems of capitalist countries. On the basis of this system, our people can exert their infinite power." The superiority of this system integrates the personal interests of the people with the interests of the country.

    The prosperity and strength of the motherland belongs to all our people; the motherland is advancing bravely, and she is taking us to a more ideal society, a society like the Soviet Union today.

    Each of us has a high degree of patriotism to build our motherland. Now, if there are still people who value individuals more than the motherland, we will despise them, they are "shameful selfish people." We should put the interests of the country first.

    Chairman Mao called on us at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "We need to continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and we need to increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." He pointed out that this is the central task of the Chinese people today.

    Compatriots across the country! Each of us must display a high degree of patriotism in our respective work posts to realize the call of the motherland and the leader to us. I have made up my mind to unite all the workers in the factory in 1952, further promote advanced experience, and strengthen workshop technical management and cost management. On the basis of 1951, we will continue to improve quality and strive to complete the national production plan half a month ahead of schedule. For this, we must first mobilize all the workers in the factory to wage a resolute struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    Compatriots across the country! Let us work together wholeheartedly to accelerate the construction of the motherland!

    Long live our great motherland!
    Long live our beloved leader Chairman Mao!

### 我们要为祖国更加繁荣富强而劳动

    我们要为祖国更加繁荣富强而劳动
    工业劳动模范  姜万寿
    我们祖国解放二年多了，全国人民在敬爱的领袖毛主席领导下发挥高度智慧，建设着我们的祖国，使我们的祖国走向繁荣富强。我们每个人民也在祖国走向繁荣富强的道路上，得到了温暖和幸福。
    一九五一年“五一”节，我光荣地到苏联参加“五一国际劳动节”观礼。在莫斯科红场上，当游行的苏联人民刚经过了检阅台到达我们代表团面前时，在整个红场上，各个国家观礼的代表和游行的人民都用中国语言共同高呼“毛泽东万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”这巨大的声浪，从莫斯科红场一直四射到远处去。
    德国人民在今年六月里在全国范围内举行了“德中友好月”，在这个月里，各个大小城市和农村的人们都学习我们祖国人民丰富斗争经验。当我们代表团到各个城市去作报告的路上，很多次被德国人民围住，要我们报告中国人民的斗争经验。他们把见到中国人民看成是很光荣的一件事。
    在德国的侨胞很感动地告诉我：“祖国的同胞们，我们现在的情景大大改变了，歧视我们的眼光是一去不返啦！”在遥远地方的侨胞，他们也感受到了祖国给予的温暖。我们祖国的国际地位是大大地提高了，我们祖国人民的荣誉传遍全世界，这是我们人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下斗争胜利的结果。
    祖国解放以后这二年当中，不仅打败和击退了美帝国主义的侵略行为，而且在经济的恢复、建设上也做出了辉煌成绩。在祖国经济还很困难的时候，就在为人民改善生活上，做出了惊人的成就，如根治淮河的巨大工程已在进行。
    我们工厂一九五一年就新建了一座很大的宿舍和一座能容近千人的食堂。在沈阳市内一九五一年也出现了无轨电车。我们工人的工资都普遍提高了百分之十五。这些新气象在全国各地都是可以看到的。
    很多工人和祖国优秀儿女被大量提拔到祖国各项建设工作中做领导工作，我也是其中的一个。几年前，我还是一个被旧社会看不起的工人。现在在党和祖国的教育下我担当了副厂长的工作。
    毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议的开会词中说：“一切事实都证明：我们的人民民主专政的制度，较之资本主义国家的政治制度具有极大的优越性。在这种制度的基础上，我国人民能够发挥其无穷无尽的力量。”这种制度的优越性，把人民的个人利益和国家的利益结成一体了。
    祖国的富强繁荣是属于我们全国人民的；祖国在奋勇前进，她带着我们还要到一个更理想的社会去，像今天苏联一样的社会。
    我们每一个人都有高度的爱国主义精神来建设我们的祖国。现在假如还有这样的人，把个人看得比祖国还重要，我们就唾弃他，他是“可耻的自私自利者”。我们应该把国家的利益放在第一位。
    毛主席在中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上号召我们：“需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。”并指出这是今天中国人民的中心任务。
    全国同胞们！我们每一个人要在各个工作岗位上发挥高度爱国主义精神，来实现祖国、领袖对我们的号召。我已下定决心在一九五二年要团结全厂职工，更进一步地推广先进经验，加强车间技术管理和成本管理。我们要在一九五一年的基础上，继续提高质量，争取提前半个月完成国家生产计划。为了这，我们首先要动员全厂职工更进一步地向贪污、浪费、官僚主义作坚决的斗争。
    全国同胞们！让我们一起来全心全意为加速祖国建设而奋斗吧！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    我们敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！
