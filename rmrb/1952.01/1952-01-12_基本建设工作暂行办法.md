Section 1: General Principles

Article 1: All new construction, reconstruction, and restoration projects of fixed assets that expand reproduction, as well as related work, shall be considered basic construction. This includes projects such as industrial and mining, transportation, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, finance, trade, culture, education, health, urban construction, and departmental construction, housing construction, cultural and educational construction, scientific experimental research construction, health construction, and public utility construction under units affiliated with government agencies above the Greater Administrative Area.

Article 2: The content of basic construction work includes the following:
	(1) Construction engineering.
	(2) Installation engineering.
	(3) Purchase of machinery, equipment, and tools and supplies belonging to fixed assets.
	(4) Design, exploration, and related geological surveys and technical research work.
	(5) Other basic construction work.

Article 3: Enterprises or non-enterprise independent engineering units (such as a certain reservoir project, a certain highway, a certain seaport, etc., hereinafter referred to as construction units) that carry out basic construction are divided into three types according to their work nature: new construction, reconstruction, and restoration.
	Units that have no foundation and are newly starting construction are units of new construction nature.
	Units that are expanding or renovating the original scale are units of reconstruction nature.
	Units that restore the original foundation and scale because the original construction was damaged and cannot be used are units of restoration nature. However, restoration that is carried out simultaneously with expansion and reconstruction is a unit of reconstruction nature.

Article 4: To facilitate the management and control of construction units by competent authorities at all levels in terms of planning, design, and construction, construction units shall be divided into two categories: "above quota" and "below quota." The quota figures shall be separately stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council (hereinafter referred to as the Central Finance and Economics Committee) according to the different circumstances of each type of enterprise, and attached to these measures. Construction units whose total investment required for the entire construction scale exceeds or equals the specified quota shall be "above quota" construction units; those smaller than the specified quota shall be "below quota" construction units. Individual construction units, if of an important nature, may be designated by the Central Finance and Economics Committee as "above quota" construction units, regardless of the total investment required.
	"Above quota" construction units with a total construction investment greater than or equal to 100 billion yuan shall be referred to as Category A construction units; those with a total construction investment less than 100 billion yuan shall be referred to as Category B construction units.
	"Below quota" construction units with a total construction investment greater than or equal to 2 billion yuan shall be referred to as Category C construction units; those with a total construction investment below 2 billion yuan shall be referred to as Category D construction units.

Section 2: Organizational Structure

Article 5: Central competent departments, general administrations for enterprise management, financial and economic committees of greater administrative areas (hereinafter referred to as Greater Administrative Area Financial and Economic Committees), professional departments of greater administrative areas, and their affiliated bureaus and enterprises, all with basic construction work, shall establish dedicated basic construction organizations as needed to lead or carry out the design, construction, planning, and other tasks of basic construction. If the design and construction of the aforementioned basic construction are entrusted to design companies and contracting companies, the task of the basic construction organization is to supervise and inspect this work.
	The formulation of basic construction plans shall be jointly carried out by the basic construction organization and the planning organization.

Article 6: All basic construction units that are simultaneously engaged in production shall have dedicated organizations in charge of basic construction work, and shall strictly separate them from the production part in terms of funds, materials, accounts, and reports.

Article 7: Central competent departments or general administrations for enterprise management shall gradually establish independent design companies and construction and installation contracting companies according to the circumstances of individual departments, based on needs and possibilities, to be responsible for the survey, design, construction, and installation work of basic construction. The work shall be carried out using a contract system (specifying tasks, clarifying responsibilities, ensuring quality, determining costs, and setting completion deadlines within the contract) and an economic accounting system.

Section 3: Design Work

Article 8: Before the official promulgation of the design regulations, these measures shall be temporarily implemented for design work.

Article 9: Design documents are the basic basis for basic construction work. All construction units must complete the necessary design documents in accordance with the design work steps and content stipulated in these measures before construction can begin; otherwise, construction shall not be allowed. During the design work, attention should be paid to economy, and extravagance and waste should be avoided.

Article 10: All Category A, B, and C construction units shall conduct investigations and research and submit a project task book for approval before starting design. The submission of the project task book must comply with the state's construction guidelines and tasks and the provisions of the state's long-term construction plan.
	The purpose of the project task book is to determine the construction plan for the design object. In the industrial field, its main contents should include the following (various constructions other than industry should also be handled with reference to the following contents, and the items shall be separately determined by the central competent department and reported to the Central Finance and Economics Committee for approval before implementation):
	(1) Product types and their importance in the national economy.
	(2) Production scale and its development prospects.
	(3) Construction site and its relationship with relevant industries.
	(4) Construction period and its coordination with relevant industries.
	(5) Investment estimates and the amount of foreign exchange required.
	(6) Resources and economic conditions, including raw material supply and product sales.

	The project task book may submit several plans simultaneously when necessary, and specifically compare their advantages and disadvantages for reference during approval.
	Once the project task book is approved, it shall not be changed without the consent of the original approval authority.

Article 11: Design work is divided into three steps: "preliminary design," "technical design," and "construction detailed drawings," which are carried out in sequence. For the design work of units of restoration nature, it can be carried out in two steps, namely "preliminary design" and "technical design with attached construction detailed drawings."
	(1) "Preliminary design" is a document that comprehensively studies and calculates the design object based on the approved project task book. The purpose is to clarify the technical possibilities and economic rationality of the design object. When conducting preliminary design, investigations and research should be conducted on the economic and technical data necessary for the design work. Design should not be carried out rashly before the investigations and research are accurate. The main contents of preliminary design in the industrial field are as follows (various constructions other than industry should be handled with reference to the following contents, and specific items shall be separately determined by the central competent department and reported to the Central Finance and Economics Committee for approval before implementation):
	(1) Specifically select the construction site of the design object.
	(2) The composition of the enterprise, the product types, production capacity, production methods, main equipment, production organization, work system, phased development plan of production capacity, and the required labor allocation plan for the entire enterprise and separate workshops.
	(3) The needs and supply methods of raw materials, materials, fuels, water, power, and internal and external transportation after phased construction.
	(4) The plan for production cooperation and connection between the design object and other enterprises. Such as the possible and necessary plans for mutual supply of finished products, semi-finished products, water, power, housing, and welfare facilities.
	(5) The construction scale, engineering standards, and construction progress of each engineering part and auxiliary building.
	(6) Calculate the total number of employees required for the phased construction of the design object and the quantity and method of ensuring their housing, public utilities, cultural and welfare facilities.
	(7) Calculate the main construction materials, equipment, power, water, labor, and temporary housing buildings required for construction and installation and the guarantee methods. Preliminary plan for construction organization.
	(8) General layout plan, sketches of main buildings and equipment.
	(9) The total project budget of the design object and the individual budgets of the main engineering parts, with attached price lists.
	(10) For the land, water, power, materials, transportation, telephone, sewers, technology, labor, and "production cooperation" required by the design object from other departments, consultations should be conducted with relevant departments in advance, and written agreement documents should be attached as attachments to the preliminary design.

	(2) "Technical design" must be prepared based on the approved preliminary design, and its content shall not violate the various provisions made in the approved preliminary design. The technical design and its attached budget, after being approved by the corresponding authority, will become the most basic document for basic construction.
	Technical design is the clarification and concretization of all regulations and technical issues in the approved preliminary design, based on which various equipment can be ordered, formal preparations for construction can be made, and various tasks that do not require construction detailed drawings can be carried out.
	The content of the technical design shall include: (1) general layout drawings, (2) production, (3) transportation, (4) power, (5) water supply and drainage, (6) heating and ventilation, (7) personnel and housing, (8) buildings and structures, (9) construction organization, and (10) technical economy. Each section is composed of necessary documents and drawings. The detailed content of the technical design will be specified separately.
	The budget attached to the technical design is a detailed calculation of the various costs of the technical design, and is an inseparable part of the technical design documents. The content and preparation of the budget will be specified separately.

	(3) "Construction detailed drawings" are detailed drawings made according to the technical design to supply the necessary information for construction.

Article 12: All construction units of new construction, reconstruction, and restoration nature, except for Category D construction units, shall make a total preliminary design with the overall construction scale of the entire construction unit in a certain year as the object when conducting preliminary design. Preliminary design should not only be done for each project or one year without a total preliminary design.
	Construction units that will continue to carry out basic construction in the next few years must complete this total preliminary design in 1952. Except for those approved by the Central Finance and Economics Committee due to special circumstances, those who fail to make a total preliminary design and submit it to the superior authority for approval in 1952 will no longer be included in the basic construction plan starting in 1953.

Article 13: (1) If the original design documents of the construction unit of restoration nature can be adopted after review, the original design documents may be submitted to the superior for approval without further design work.
	(2) The content of the preliminary design of construction units of restoration or reconstruction nature below the quota can be simplified according to the situation. The simplification method shall be stipulated by the central competent department and reported to the Central Finance and Economics Committee for record.

Article 14: If the scale of the design object is huge and technically difficult, and it is necessary to hire foreign design teams or design experts, it shall be handled in accordance with the "Measures for Hiring Foreign Design Teams" promulgated by the Central Finance and Economics Committee on April 30, 1951.

Article 15: The review and approval procedures for design documents are as follows: (attached form)
	Note:
	(1) The submission or approval by the Greater Administrative Area listed in the table refers to the construction units under the management of the Greater Administrative Area. (2) The construction units led by the Greater Administrative Area (including local enterprises), except for construction units above the quota that must submit the project task book to the central competent department for review and transfer to the Central Finance and Economics Committee for approval, the rest shall be approved by the Greater Administrative Area Financial and Economic Committee according to its own procedures.
	If individual business departments have difficulties in handling matters in accordance with this article due to special circumstances, the central competent department may make supplementary regulations in accordance with the principles of this article and report them to the Central Finance and Economics Committee for approval before implementation.

Article 16: After the various design documents are approved, the construction unit shall not change them without authorization. If changes are necessary due to factual needs, they shall be reported for approval according to the procedures in the preceding article. However, purely technical corrections that do not change the original design's scale and standards may be modified with the consent of the original design organization.

Article 17: When the design organization is sound or the conditions are ripe, the central competent departments should compile various standard designs as much as possible and issue them for adoption by their subordinate departments, in order to save the strength of design personnel and design costs.

Section 4: Construction Work

Article 18: The construction work of each construction unit shall be carried out in accordance with the approved design documents and basic construction plan; construction shall not be carried out unless the above documents have been approved.
	(1) Category A construction units above the quota must start construction after the technical design, project budget, and annual basic construction plan have been approved. However, such construction units may: (1) formulate an annual basic construction plan for relevant preparatory works (such as road construction, site leveling, power transmission lines, and necessary workers' dormitories) after the preliminary design is approved, and start construction after approval. (2) After the preliminary design is approved, make the technical design, project budget, and annual basic construction plan for the first phase of construction in order of construction, and start construction after reporting to the corresponding authority for approval.
	(2) Category B construction units above the quota shall also handle matters in accordance with the preceding paragraph. However, if the construction time limit is urgent, the central competent department may report to the Central Finance and Economics Committee for approval to arrange construction after the preliminary design, project estimate, and annual basic construction plan have been approved, but the technical design of each project shall still be completed and approved before construction begins.
	(3) Category C construction units below the quota may arrange construction based on the approved preliminary design, project estimate, and annual basic construction plan, but the technical design of each project shall still be completed and approved before construction begins.
	(4) If the basic construction of each construction unit is carried out in phases and the technical design is completed in phases, the sum of the project budgets attached to the technical designs of each phase shall not exceed the project estimate in the approved preliminary design.

Article 19: Construction should be handled in accordance with the following principles:
	(1) Strict management should be carried out for the application for funds, supply of materials, and engineering organization, and it should be coordinated with the progress of construction; efforts should be made to avoid adverse phenomena such as accumulation of funds and materials, idle funds, and suspension of work waiting for materials, which affect the progress of the project.
	(2) During the project, the construction standards stipulated in the design should be observed to avoid wasting labor and materials and shoddy construction, which affects the quality of the project.

Section 5: Supervision of Appropriation and Inspection Work

Article 20: The financial budget for basic construction shall be prepared, reviewed, and allocated according to the affiliation relationship of the construction unit, divided into two systems: central (including enterprises entrusted to the Greater Administrative Area for management) and Greater Administrative Area (including local enterprises). That is, those belonging to the central system (including enterprises entrusted to the Greater Administrative Area for management) shall be allocated from the central budget, and those belonging to the Greater Administrative Area system shall be allocated from the Greater Administrative Area budget or the local budget.
	For basic construction jointly invested by the central government and the Greater Administrative Area or local governments, the allocation of the financial budget shall be handled separately according to the respective investment amounts with reference to the provisions of this article.

Article 21: The appropriation of the basic construction financial budget shall be supervised and allocated by the specialized bank designated by the Ministry of Finance of the central government in accordance with the instructions of the Central Finance and Economics Committee. The Ministry of Finance of the central government and the specialized bank shall periodically submit reports and summaries on the supervision of appropriation work to relevant departments and the Central Finance and Economics Committee. The specific methods shall be separately determined by the Central Finance and Economics Committee.

Article 22: Each construction unit shall periodically report the completion of its basic construction plan to the superior (periodic reports are statistical reports), and shall submit quarterly and annual summaries at the end of each quarter and year, reporting level by level.

Article 23: The central competent departments, general administrations for enterprise management, and the financial and economic committees and professional departments of the greater administrative areas shall establish a regular inspection system for their affiliated construction units. There are two methods: (1) conduct inspections based on the periodic statistical reports of each construction unit, and compile comprehensive reports on a regular basis and report them level by level according to the prescribed system. At the end of each quarter and year, written summaries must be made and reported level by level. (2) For important construction units and construction units with major problems discovered based on periodic statistical reports, personnel should be dispatched to the construction site at any time for inspection, and the inspection results should be reported level by level in a special report.

Article 24: The forms of the periodic statistical reports for basic construction and the implementation methods shall be separately issued by the Central Finance and Economics Committee.

Section 6: Acceptance and Handover and Project Final Accounts

Article 25: The main purpose of project acceptance is to check whether the completion status has met the production (or use) requirements in terms of the goals and specifications of the design documents and whether it can be put into production (or use). In addition to jointly accepting each project with the specialized bank at any time when the project is completed in accordance with the technical design and making acceptance certificates (especially for hidden engineering parts—such as foundation engineering, underground pipelines, etc.), each construction unit shall conduct a general formal acceptance and handover when all projects are completed or come to an end and transferred to the production (or use) department for use. The procedures for formal acceptance are as follows:
	(1) When Category A construction units conduct formal acceptance and handover, they shall report to the general administration for enterprise management and the central competent department. The central competent department shall conduct acceptance in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance of the central government and the financial and economic committee of the greater administrative area (and may hire specialized personnel and consult with the People's Supervisory Committee when necessary). The acceptance report shall be submitted by the central competent department to the Central Finance and Economics Committee.
	(2) When Category B and C construction units conduct formal acceptance and handover, they shall report to the general administration for enterprise management and the central competent department. The central competent department or the general administration for enterprise management shall send personnel to conduct acceptance. Construction units led by the Greater Administrative Area shall report to the professional department and financial and economic committee of the Greater Administrative Area. The financial and economic committee or professional department of the Greater Administrative Area shall send personnel to conduct acceptance.

Article 26: Each construction unit shall prepare project final accounts upon completion of the project:
	(1) Each construction unit shall prepare project final accounts upon completion of all projects or completion of a certain phase of the project, and send them to the general administration for enterprise management or the professional department of the Greater Administrative Area for review and transfer to the central competent department. The central competent department shall review and transfer them to the Ministry of Finance of the central government for audit, and send a copy to the specialized bank for appropriation, which shall be converted into fixed assets after acceptance.
	(2) The central competent department shall calculate the cost of labor and materials of each construction unit based on the project final accounts, and make a record of the quota for the use of materials and labor for the "engineering measurement unit" of each project (such as one cubic meter of concrete engineering). The results shall be summarized and reported to the Central Finance and Economics Committee once a year as a reference for gradually improving the quota by accumulating experience.

Section 7: Formulation and Approval of Plans

Article 27: The basic construction plan is an important part of the national economic plan and must conform to the overall political and economic tasks of the state for a certain period and the state's long-term construction plan, and stipulate the total amount of basic construction work and the speed and procedures of construction during the planning period. Its content shall include the plans for various tasks such as exploration, design, and construction, and shall be prepared annually and quarterly. When formulating and approving plans, authorities at all levels shall pay attention to the guiding, realistic, and serious nature of the plans; follow the government's instructions, consider comprehensively, combine with reality, formulate and review plans, and arrange work and supervise its implementation based on the approved plans.

	(3) Approve the plan from top to bottom.

Article 29: The basic construction plan shall be prepared, summarized, and approved according to the affiliation relationship of the construction unit, divided into two systems: central (including enterprises entrusted to the Greater Administrative Area for management) and Greater Administrative Area (including local enterprises).
	For basic construction jointly invested by the Greater Administrative Area or the central government and local governments, the preparation and summary of the plan shall be handled according to the affiliation relationship of the construction unit.

Article 30: The issuance of plan control figures shall be handled according to the following procedures:
	(1) The Central Finance and Economics Committee shall formulate a draft of the control figures for the central competent departments and the greater administrative areas in accordance with the central government's economic construction policy, the needs of national defense and national economic construction, the balance of production capacity and material supply, the rational distribution of production capacity among regions, and the possibilities of human, material, and financial resources, and with reference to the opinions of the central competent departments and the greater administrative areas. It only stipulates the control figures for several major construction units and the percentage of the central competent departments and the Greater Administrative Area Financial and Economic Committee's maneuverable figures, and the rest shall be allocated by the central competent departments and the Greater Administrative Area Financial and Economic Committee themselves; and submit it to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for review and approval.
	Before the Central Finance and Economics Committee formulates the control figures, the central competent department shall submit opinions on the basic construction control figures of its directly affiliated and entrusted enterprises to the Greater Administrative Area for management to the Central Finance and Economics Committee for reference. (For the central state-owned enterprises managed by the Greater Administrative Area, the financial and economic committee of the Greater Administrative Area shall submit opinions to the Central Finance and Economics Committee, and the professional department of the Greater Administrative Area shall submit opinions to the central competent department for review and transfer to the Central Finance and Economics Committee for reference.)
	Before the Central Finance and Economics Committee formulates the control figures, the financial and economic committees of the greater administrative areas (Northeast is the People's Economic Planning Committee) shall submit a draft of the control figures for the basic construction investment of each region (including the Greater Administrative Area and local governments), along with an explanation, to the Central Finance and Economics Committee for reference.

    第七条  中央各主管部或事业管理总局应按照个别部门的情况，根据需要与可能，逐渐成立独立的设计公司及建筑安装包工公司，负责基本建设之调查设计及建筑安装工作。工作之进行应采用合同制（在合同内规定任务、明确责任、保证质量、确定费用及完成期限）与经济核算制。
    第三节  设计工作
    第八条  设计工作在正式的设计条例未颁布前，暂照本办法施行。
    第九条  设计文件为基本建设工作的基本依据，所有建设单位，在施工以前必须依照本办法所规定的设计工作步骤与内容完成必需的设计文件，否则不得施工。在进行设计工作时，应注意节约，力避铺张浪费。
    第十条  所有甲、乙、丙三类的建设单位，在进行设计以前，应先经调查研究，提出计划任务书经批准后，方得开始设计。计划任务书之提出必须符合于国家建设的方针与任务及国家长期建设计划之规定。
    计划任务书之目的在确定设计对象的建设计划方案，在工业方面其主要内容应包括下列各项（工业以外的各种建设，亦应比照下列内容办理，其项目由中央主管部另定，报中财委核准后施行）：
    （一）产品种类及在国民经济中的重要性。
    （二）生产规模及其发展远景。
    （三）建设地点及与有关工业之关系。
    （四）建设期限及与有关工业之配合。
    （五）投资估计数及所需外汇数。
    （六）资源与经济条件，包括原材料供应与产品销路。
    计划任务书必要时可以同时提出几个方案，并具体比较其利弊，以供核定时之参考。
    计划任务书经核定后，未得原批准机关之同意，不得变更。
    第十一条  设计工作分为“初步设计”、“技术设计”、“施工详图”三个步骤，依次进行。凡恢复性质的单位之设计工作，得按两个步骤进行之，即“初步设计”、“技术设计并附施工详图”。
    （一）“初步设计”是根据批准的计划任务书对设计对象作通盘的研究与计算的文件，目的在阐明设计对象在技术上的可能性与经济上的合理性。在进行初步设计时，应先对设计工作所必需的经济及技术的资料进行调查研究，在调查研究未详确前，不得草率进行设计。初步设计在工业方面其主要内容如下（工业以外的各种建设，应比照以下内容，由中央主管部另定具体项目，报中财委核准后施行）：
    （１）具体选定设计对象的建设地址。
    （２）企业的构成，全企业及分开车间的产品种类、生产能力、生产方法、主要设备、生产组织、工作制度、生产能力的分期发展计划以及其所需的劳动力配备计划。
    （３）分期开工后原料、材料、燃料、水、动力及厂内外运输等方面的需要量及供应方法。
    （４）设计对象与其他企业的生产协作与联系的方案。如互相供应成品、半成品、水、动力、住宅及福利设施的可能与必要的方案。
    （５）各工程部分及辅助建筑物的建筑规模、工程标准、工程进度。

    （１０）凡设计对象要求其它部门供应的土地、水、动力、材料、运输、电话、下水道、技术、劳动力，以及“生产协作”应事先与有关部门进行协商，并将书面协议文件附送作为初步设计的附件。
    （二）“技术设计”必须依据已批准的初步设计编制，其内容不得违反已批准的初步设计所作的各项规定。技术设计及其所附的预算经过相应机关批准，即成为基本建设的最基本的文件。
    技术设计是对批准的初步设计中一切规定及技术问题的明确化与具体化，依此即可进行各种设备的订货，施工的正式准备及不需要施工详图的各项工作。
    技术设计的内容应包括：（１）总布置图、（２）生产、（３）运输、（４）动力、（５）给水排水、（６）采暖通风、（７）人员及住宅、（８）房屋建筑物、（９）施工组织、（１０）技术经济等篇。每篇皆由必要的文件及图纸所组成。技术设计之详细内容另行规定之。
    技术设计所附的预算是对技术设计各项费用的详细计算，是技术设计文件不可分割的部分。预算的内容及编制另行规定之。
    （三）“施工详图”系依照技术设计制出供给施工时所必需的详细图样。
    第十二条  所有新建、改建及恢复性质的建设单位，除丁类建设单位外，在进行初步设计时，均应以整个建设单位在一定年度内总的建设规模为对象，做出总的初步设计。不应只做每项工程或一个年度的初步设计，而无总的初步设计。
    凡在今后数年内继续进行基本建设的建设单位，必须于一九五二年内完成此项总的初步设计。除因特殊情况报经中财委批准者外，凡于一九五二年内未做出总的初步设计并经呈送上级机关批准者，自一九五三年开始，即不再列入基本建设计划之内。
    第十三条  （一）恢复性质的建设单位，如原有设计文件，并经审查可以采用时，得以原设计文件呈送上级批准，不另进行设计工作。
    （二）限额以下恢复或改建性质的建设单位，其初步设计的内容可以酌量情况加以简化。简化办法由中央主管部规定，呈报中财委备案。
    第十四条  如设计对象规模巨大，技术困难，需聘请国外设计组或设计专家时，应按照中财委一九五一年四月三十日颁布之聘请国外设计组办法办理。
    第十五条  设计文件之审核及批准程序如下：(附表格)
     附注：
    （１）表中所列大行政区提出或大行政区批准的，系指大行政区代管的建设单位。（２）大行政区领导的建设单位（包括地方事业），除限额以上的建设单位须将计划任务书报送中央主管部核转中财委批准外，其余均由大行政区财委自行规定程序批准之。
    个别事业部门如情况特殊照本条办法办理有困难者，得由中央主管部依照本条之原则作补充规定，报请中财委批准后施行。
    第十六条  各项设计文件经批准后，建设单位不得擅自变更，遇有事实需要必须变更时，应照前条程序报请批准。但关于纯技术性之修正，不变更原设计之规模及标准者，经原设计机构之同意得加以修改。
    第十七条  中央各主管部于设计机构健全或条件成熟时，应尽可能编制各种标准设计，颁发所属各部门采用，借以节省设计人员力量与设计费用。
    第四节  施工工作
    第十八条  各建设单位的施工工作，应依照批准之设计文件及基本建设计划进行；以上文件未经批准者，不得进行施工。
    （一）限额以上的甲类建设单位，必须于技术设计、工程预算及年度基本建设计划经批准后，方得施工。但此类建设单位得：（１）于初步设计批准后即拟具有关准备工程（如修路、平场、输电线路及必要的工人宿舍等）的年度基本建设计划，经批准后，先行开工。（２）初步设计批准后，按其建设先后次序，做出第一期建设部分的技术设计、工程预算及年度基本建设计划，报经相应机关批准后开工。
    （二）限额以上的乙类建设单位亦应照前项办法办理，但遇建设时限急迫时，得由中央主管部报请中财委核准于初步设计、工程概算及年度基本建设计划批准后布置施工，但每项工程之技术设计，仍应在开工前完成并经批准。
    （三）限额以下的丙类建设单位，得根据批准之初步设计、工程概算及年度基本建设计划布置施工，但每项工程之技术设计，仍应在开工前完成并经批准。
    （四）各建设单位之基本建设，如系分期进行，分期完成技术设计者，其各期技术设计所附工程预算之总和，不得超过已批准的初步设计中的工程概算。
    第十九条  施工时应按照下列原则办理：
    （一）对于请领款项、供应材料、工程组织等，应予严密管理，并应与建设进度相配合；力避积存款项及材料、呆置资金及停工待料等不良现象发生，影响工程进度。
    （二）工程进行时，应遵守设计时所规定的施工标准，避免浪费工料及粗制滥造，影响工程质量。
    第五节  监督拨款与检查工作
    第二十条  基本建设的财务预算，依照建设单位的隶属关系分按中央（包括委托大行政区代管事业）与大行政区（包括地方事业）两个系统编制、审核与拨付。即属于中央系统者（包括委托大行政区代管事业）由中央预算中拨付，属于大行政区系统者，分由大行政区预算或地方预算中拨付之。
    凡中央与大行政区或地方共同投资的基本建设，其财务预算之拨付，得按各该投资额分别比照本条之规定办理之。
    第二十一条  基本建设财务预算的拨款工作，由中央财政部根据中财委指示指定专业银行按照计划监督拨付之。中央财政部与专业银行对于监督拨款工作，应定期提出报告及总结，分送有关部及中财委，其办法由中财委另定之。
    第二十二条  各建设单位应将其基本建设计划完成情况，定期向上级作报告（定期报告为统计报表），并须于季度、年度终了时作季度、年度总结，逐级上报。
    第二十三条  中央主管部、事业管理总局、大行政区财委及专业部应对其所属建设单位建立经常的检查制度。方式有二：（１）依据各建设单位的定期统计报表进行检查，并按期编制综合报表按照规定系统逐级上报。季度、年度终了时，须作文字总结逐级上报。（２）对重要的建设单位及根据定期统计报表发现重大问题的建设单位，应随时派员至工地检查，并将检查结果专题逐级上报。
    第二十四条  基本建设定期统计报表的表式及实施办法由中财委另行颁行。
    第六节  验收交接与工程决算
    第二十五条  工程验收的主要目的，在于检查完工的情况是否依照设计文件的目标和规格完成了生产（或使用）方面的要求，能否进行生产（或使用）。各建设单位除于每项工程竣工时，依照技术设计随时会同专业银行验收并做出验收证件（特别是隐蔽工程部分——例如基础工程、地下管线等）外；在全部工程完竣或告一段落、并移交生产（或使用）部门开始使用时，应作总的正式验收交接。关于正式验收的程序如下：
    （一）甲类建设单位正式验收交接时，应报事业管理总局及中央主管部，由中央主管部会同中央财政部及大行政区财委（必要时得聘请专门人员及会同人民监察委员会）进行验收，验收报告由中央主管部报送中财委。
    （二）乙类及丙类建设单位正式验收交接时，应报事业管理总局及中央主管部，由中央主管部或事业管理总局派员进行验收。大行政区领导之建设单位应报大行政区专业部及财委，由大行政区财委或专业部派员验收。
    第二十六条  各建设单位于工程竣工时应编造工程决算：
