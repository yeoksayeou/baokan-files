    Self-Criticism Regarding the Major Corruption Case of Song Degui and Liu Yuze Colluding with Unscrupulous Merchants to Steal State Property
    Liu Fuzhi, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Public Security

    The major corruption case of major corruption offenders Song Degui and Liu Yuze, etc., colluding with unscrupulous merchants to steal state property has been thoroughly exposed. This major case has caused huge losses to the country and serious damage to the Party, the government, and the people. This is a serious consequence of my extremely serious bureaucracy. My bureaucratic errors are the root cause of why this painful incident occurred and was not exposed for a long time. As the leading person in charge of the administrative section of the General Office, in this work, I violated the state and Party's policies and guidelines, failed to implement the correct instructions of the leaders, and failed to play the role that a Communist Party member should have played in the important work position entrusted to me by the Party and the higher authorities. Although I personally did not engage in corruption or accept bribes from these corrupt elements, due to my serious bureaucracy, I was long deceived, misled, and used by these corrupt elements, traitors to the Party and the people, and pests of society. I am very ashamed to the country, the Party, and the people.

    My first big mistake was sending Song Degui to the Northeast to purchase construction timber. I approved the proposal of the major corrupt offender Song Degui to purchase 11,000 meters (later increased to 13,000 meters) of timber for the office through Song Degui, with the approval of the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee, exceeding actual needs. In order to subsidize construction overruns and solve housing problems, I made such a rash and wrong decision without asking the higher authorities. I did not consider that wasting state timber was a serious mistake, nor did I consider that this mistake would have serious consequences. Under the control of this localist "grab-a-handful" mentality that only cared about the partial interests of the office, I committed this big mistake.

    The second mistake occurred in May and June of last year after the timber was successively transported to Beijing. At that time, Song Degui and Liu Yuze repeatedly suggested to me that "transferring" a batch of timber to the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways could not only obtain great benefits from it, but also ensure that the office still had enough timber for its own use. At this time, I realized that the amount of timber purchased exceeded the actual needs by more than double. Although I hesitated and considered it, I did not resolutely correct this mistake. After a period of wavering, I developed this mistake further and agreed to their suggestion (at that time, the design of the Great Hall was changed, and construction was delayed). Buying and selling timber between offices is an illegal act. I had no understanding or awareness of this. I did not study the policies and regulations on timber. I showed a complete lack of principle in grasping policies and safeguarding the overall interests of the state. In fact, we purchased timber at a low price and sold it to the Ministry of Railways at a price higher than that stipulated by the state, thereby obtaining huge profits for our office. Although it allowed the office to build more houses and subsidize some construction overruns, it was still very wrong. I thus committed the error of a purely profit-seeking viewpoint, starting from localism.

    These two big mistakes of mine were the preconditions for the corrupt elements to collude with unscrupulous merchants and steal a large amount of state property. They were also the foundation for my seriously developing bureaucracy in this major corruption case.

    I displayed a very bad bureaucratic attitude throughout the entire process of purchasing timber:

    First, the procurement arrangement was unplanned, the work process was unchecked, completely out of control, and I never knew exactly how much was purchased, how much was used, or how much profit was made. This account for the purchase of timber has not been fully clarified even now. I did not understand or study the timber issue. I felt that how many cubic meters and how much money were specific matters, and I was too lazy to manage them, showing an attitude of indifference and irresponsibility towards the property of the state and the people.

    Second, there was no work inspection for the procurement personnel. I only listened to the false reports of Song Degui alone, never personally convened a meeting, and did not stipulate strict accounting systems and expenditure procedures, but was satisfied with so-called principled leadership. I had announced that if personnel going out had difficulties in their personal lives, they could make a request to the organization, and with approval, they could spend a little more, but they were not allowed to engage in corruption, decadence, or recklessness. However, I never checked their actual work and living conditions. I even believed Song Degui's fabricated lies such as: "Wang Zhen (one of the main criminals in the timber corruption case) has shown very good performance in his work, very hard, and has become emaciated. The staff members are all very hardworking." In reality, this group of corrupt elements, this group of bad eggs, all gained weight when they returned from the Northeast. I was completely unalert and had no sense of smell for the two-faced tactics of these corrupt elements. They seized on my bureaucratic weakness of only seeking to complete tasks and blindly letting go and allowing things to happen. They said yes to my face but did whatever they wanted behind my back. I was kept in the dark, becoming deaf and blind!

    Third, I lost vigilance against the erosion of the bourgeoisie. Song Degui said: Timber is a complex technical issue. Inspection, measurement, and loading all depend on this group of timber merchants. Although I also asked about the employment of timber merchants, I was deceived by the official-sounding words that Donghua was a sales agency for the coal and construction company and that they all had relations with the public sector and performed very well. I never had any vigilance about what these timber merchants were or what unspeakable relationships existed between them.

    My bureaucracy was not only manifested in a lack of vigilance, but also in blind trust. I felt that Song Degui's handling of timber had solved a problem for the office, that he had "achievements" and was very "capable." After the Fourth Public Security Conference, I heard a little about his corrupt life. Some comrades reported that Song often drank alcohol and often sat in the office's car with businessmen. I also warned him about this. But because I did not perceive the essence of the problem, I thought that a warning would make them pay attention and change. Basically, I still adopted a laissez-faire and accommodating attitude. My serious bureaucracy created favorable conditions for this group of corrupt elements to carry out criminal activities. In reality, it became a hotbed for corrupt and degenerate elements to carry out sabotage activities and spread bourgeois filth!

    The entire inside story of the corruption case and my serious mistakes gradually came to light only after the administrative section fully turned to the anti-corruption and anti-waste democratic movement during the Party Congress. This small group of pests headed by Song Degui had long colluded with unscrupulous merchants. A large amount of state property had long been stolen. They had already spent several months in a life of shameless debauchery. They had become traitors to the people and the despicable and shameless lackeys of capitalists. Not only that, they also corrupted a group of our cadres, dragging down a group of people with weak wills. They bribed extensively within the administrative section and even outside the administrative section, making 80 percent of the personnel in the administrative section unclean. The unscrupulous merchant Zhao Xiqiao also used Song Degui to embezzle the name of the office, swindle and deceive, and act recklessly, causing huge losses to the country.

    Because of the bureaucracy in my link, I did not understand or check the real situation for a long time, and I was deceived and misled by corrupt and degenerate elements. Therefore, the policies of the Party and the higher-level leaders could not be implemented in the administrative section. Because of my numbness and ignorance of the truth, I did not and could not reflect the real situation to the leading comrades. Therefore, I actually played a role in covering up corrupt elements. I should bear full responsibility for this mistake, and I should be subject to disciplinary and Party disciplinary action.

    My bureaucracy is also very serious in other aspects. For example, in terms of office construction, there was a lot of rework, waste, and extravagance. Some were due to lack of knowledge and experience; some were due to irresponsibility; some were due to being fond of extravagance. From the leadership's point of view, I must bear the main responsibility. In the construction and repair work, there were also serious phenomena of staff members engaging in corruption and bribery. For example, the major corrupt offender Liu Yuze colluded with Lihua Construction Factory to underreport and skimp on materials in the repairs. According to what has been verified, Liu Yuze alone received 12 million yuan in bribes in one project.

    In controlling office expenditures, due to bureaucracy and a lack of mass perspective, it also caused many serious phenomena of extravagance and waste. Many notes reported to the General Office were approved by me. I did not think of ways to resolutely curb this trend. Many extravagant and wasteful phenomena were handled perfunctorily. On the other hand, very little, very poorly, and very slowly was done for the welfare of the masses. For example, the canteen and housing only attracted attention after repeated urging by the minister, and the housing problem has not been solved well even now. I rarely went to the units living outside to solve their problems. Some have not been visited even once since their establishment. I am high above, and my leadership of the administrative section is bureaucratic. I rely on corrupt and degenerate elements and am completely divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, and completely ignorant. I handle problems lavishly, showing that I do not pay attention to the system, do not adhere to the system, and do not resolutely find ways to establish a system when there is no system.

    Why did such serious bureaucratic errors occur? I was born into a bourgeois family. Although I have received long-term education from the Party and some training in revolutionary struggles, although the bad habits brought by the original class have been severely criticized in rectification and Party rectification, today's facts prove that they have not been completely rectified. After entering the city, not long after, under the victorious situation and under the conditions of smooth work, the old problems relapsed. Not only did I not eliminate the influence brought by the original class, but I continued to accept the influence of the new bourgeoisie. In the past two years, my emotions of pride, conceit, self-righteousness, and nonchalance have grown. Instead of being humble, calm, and cautious, I am simple, impatient, subjective, and arbitrary, often losing my temper and often offending people. These have made me divorced from the examination and supervision of the masses, and I have shown a state of stagnation in politics. In terms of personal life, hedonistic thoughts have risen, and I have taken a big step towards seeking pleasure in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. I have lost a lot of the glorious tradition of hard work and simplicity. I always want to make my personal life more comfortable. I am nonchalant, arrogant, very unreserved, and very unhardworking. I have been greatly influenced and eroded by the bourgeoisie in both thought and life. In this way, I gradually lost my political sense of smell, and my class vigilance gradually blurred. I can be said to be oblivious to major corrupt elements like Song Degui and Liu Yuze. Many extravagant and wasteful phenomena are not only numb, but also commonplace. These serious weaknesses have created loopholes for corrupt and degenerate elements to exploit. My mistakes are very serious. I am grateful to the Party and comrades for their help and education in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. I am grateful for the wise policies and instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. I have the determination and confidence to thoroughly correct my mistakes, thoroughly transform myself, and continuously improve myself.

    对于大贪污犯宋德贵、刘玉泽勾结奸商盗窃国家财产的大贪污案的自我检讨
    中央公安部办公厅副主任　刘复之
    宋德贵、刘玉泽等大贪污犯，勾结奸商，盗窃国家财产的大贪污案，已被彻底揭发了。这一重大案件，给国家造成了巨大的损失，使党、政府和人民遭受了严重的损害。这是我的十分严重的官僚主义造成的严重恶果。我的官僚主义的错误，就是这一痛心事件所以发生和长期没有被揭发的根本原因。我是办公厅主管行政处工作的领导人员，在这个工作中，我违背了国家和党的政策方针，没有贯彻执行领导同志的正确指示，在党和上级委托给我的重要的工作岗位上，没有发挥一个共产党员应有的作用。我个人虽然没有贪污，没有接受这批贪污分子的贿赂，但是由于我的严重的官僚主义，我是被这批贪污分子、党和人民的叛徒、社会的害虫所长期蒙蔽、欺骗和利用了。对国家，对党，对人民说来，我是十分惭愧的。
    我的第一个大错误，就是派宋德贵到东北去采购修建木材。我批准了大贪污犯宋德贵的提议，由宋德贵经手，经过东北财政经济委员会的批准，超过实际需要，为机关买进了一万一千米（以后又增加二千米）木材。为了补贴修建超支，为了解决房屋问题，我没有请示上级，就作了这样轻率的错误的决定，没有考虑浪费国家木材是严重错误，没有考虑这种错误会发生严重的后果。在这样只顾机关局部利益的本位主义的抓一把的思想支配下，就犯了这个大错误。
    第二个错误发生在去年五、六月间，木材陆续运京以后。当时，宋德贵、刘玉泽数次向我建议，“转让”一批木材给铁道部材料局，既可以从中取得很大的利益，机关所需木材又仍然够用。这时我才知道多买的木材，超过实际需要一倍以上。我虽然有过犹豫和考虑，但是没有坚决纠正这个错误，经过一度动摇，又发展了这个错误，同意了他们的意见（当时正值大礼堂设计改变，施工延期）。机关与机关之间买卖木材，是一种犯法的行为，对于这一点，我毫无认识和察觉。我没有研究关于木材的政策法令，在掌握政策、维护国家整体利益这个关头上，我表现了毫无原则。实际上，我们是以低价购进木材，以高于国家规定的价格售给铁道部，从中为本机关取得暴利。虽然给机关多修了房子，补贴了修建中的若干超支，但仍是十分错误的。我就这样从本位主义出发，犯了单纯盈利观点的错误。
    我这两个大错误，是贪污分子得以勾结奸商、盗窃国家大量财产的前提条件，也是我在这一件大贪污案中，严重发展的官僚主义的基础。
    对于采购木材的全部过程，我表现了十分恶劣的官僚主义态度：
    第一、布置采购毫无计划，工作过程毫无检查，完全失却控制，始终不知道究竟买进了多少？使用了多少？赚了多大便宜？这一笔采购木材的账，直到现在也还没有完全弄清楚。对于木材问题不了解也不研究，觉得多少立方米多少钱是具体事务，我嫌麻烦，没有去管，表现对国家和人民的财产漠不关心和不负责任的态度。
    第二、对于采购人员，没有工作检查。我只听了宋德贵一个人的假报告，没有亲自召开过会议，没有规定严格的会计制度和开支手续，而满足于所谓原则领导。我曾经宣布过，外出人员个人生活上有困难，向组织提出，经过批准，可以多用一点，但不准贪污腐化和胡闹。但是却从来没有检查过他们的实际工作和生活状况。甚至相信了宋德贵捏造的：“王珍（木材贪污案中的要犯之一）工作表现很好，很辛苦，弄得面黄肌瘦了，工作人员都很艰苦”等鬼话。实际上这一批贪污分子，这批坏蛋，从东北回来，都吃肥了，对于贪污分子这种两面派的手法，毫无警惕，毫无嗅觉。他们抓住了我的官僚主义的只求完成任务、盲目放手放任的弱点，当面唯唯诺诺，背后胡作非为。我被蒙在鼓里，成了聋子瞎子！
    第三、对于资产阶级的腐蚀，丧失了警惕。宋德贵说：木材是复杂的技术问题，验料、过尺、装车，非靠这批木商不可。我虽然也问过雇用木商的情况，但被所谓东华是煤建公司的代销处，跟公家都有关系，表现很好等官冕堂皇的词句蒙蔽了。这批木商究竟是什么东西，他们之间有什么不可告人的关系，却始终没有警惕。
    我的官僚主义，不仅表现在没有警惕性，而且盲目信任，觉得宋德贵搞木材，给机关解决了一个问题，他有“成绩”，非常“能干”。四次公安会议以后，对他的腐化生活略有所闻。有同志反映：宋常酗酒，常和商人一块坐机关的汽车，我也曾向他提出过警告。但因为没有察觉问题的本质，以为警告一下，他们会注意改变的。基本上还是采取了放任迁就的态度。我这个严重的官僚主义，给这一批贪污分子造成进行犯罪活动的有利条件，实际上成了贪污蜕化分子进行破坏活动、散布资产阶级污毒的温床！
    贪污案的全部黑幕和我的严重错误，在党代表大会时行政处全力转入反贪污腐化的民主运动以后，才逐渐暴露出来。这一小群以宋德贵为首的害虫，早就和奸商勾结上了。国家大量财产，早就被盗窃了。他们已经过了几个月荒淫无耻的日子了。他们已经变成人民的叛徒、资本家的卑鄙无耻的走狗了。不仅如此，他们还腐化了我们一批干部，将一批意志薄弱的分子，拉下水了。他们在行政处内部，以至行政处外部，大批行贿，使行政处百分之八十的人员不干净。奸商赵溪桥并通过宋德贵，盗用机关名义，招摇撞骗，胡作非为，给国家造成巨大的损失。
    由于我这个环节上的官僚主义，长期不了解、不检查真实情况，被贪污蜕化分子所蒙蔽欺骗，因此，使得党和上级领导同志的方针，在行政处无法贯彻；由于我的麻木不仁，不了解真情，没有也不能向领导同志反映真实情况，因此，就在实际上起了掩护贪污分子的作用。我应负这个错误的全部责任，我应该受到法纪和党纪的处分。
    我的官僚主义，在其他方面也是十分严重的。例如，在机关修建方面，返工浪费和铺张浪费都很大。有的是没有知识没有经验；有的是不负责任；有的是好事铺张；从领导上说，我都要负主要责任。在修建修缮工作中，也发生了工作人员从中贪污受贿的严重现象。例如，大贪污犯刘玉泽，勾结利华营造厂，在修缮中以少报多，偷工减料。据已查清者，刘玉泽一人在一项工程中，即受贿一千二百万元。
    在掌握机关开支方面，由于官僚主义和没有群众观点，也造成许多铺张浪费的严重现象。许多报到办公厅的条子，都是我经手批的。我没有想办法坚决遏止这个趋势，对于许多铺张浪费的现象，都是马马虎虎地处理了。另一方面，对于大众生活福利，做的却很少、很坏、很慢。例如，大灶生活和住房，在部长一再督促下，才引起了重视，住房则至今也没有解决好。我很少到住在外面的各单位去解决他们的问题。有的从成立到现在，还没有去过一次。我高高在上，对于行政处的工作是官僚主义的领导，依托的是贪污蜕化分子，完全脱离了群众，脱离了实际，两眼漆黑。处理问题大手大脚，表现办事不重视制度，不坚持制度，没有制度也不坚决设法建立制度等。
    为什么会发生这样严重的官僚主义的错误呢？我出身于资产阶级的家庭，虽然受过党的长期教育和革命斗争的若干锻炼，虽然原阶级带来的劣根性在整风、整党中经过比较严厉的批判，但今天事实证明，并没有完全整掉；而在入城以后，没有多久，在胜利的形势下，在工作顺利的条件下，老毛病又发作了。不仅没有肃清原来阶级所带来的影响，反而继续接受了新的资产阶级的影响。近二年来，又增长着骄傲自负、自以为是、满不在乎的情绪，不是虚心、冷静、谨慎，而是简单急躁，主观武断，经常爱发脾气，经常碰人。这些就使我脱离了群众的检查和监督，在政治上表现了停滞状态。在个人生活方面，享乐主义思想上升了，衣食住行都向贪图享乐方面迈进了一大步，艰苦朴素的光荣传统大量丢失，总想把个人生活搞得舒服些，满不在乎，骄气很大，很不检点，很不刻苦。思想上和生活上都受到资产阶级不少的影响和侵蚀。这样，我就逐渐丧失了政治嗅觉，阶级警惕逐渐模糊。我对于像宋德贵、刘玉泽这样的大贪污分子，可以说是熟视无睹的。对于许多铺张浪费现象，不仅是麻木不仁，而且是习以为常的。这些严重的弱点，都给贪污蜕化分子造成可以利用的空子。我的错误是十分严重的，我感谢反贪污浪费、反官僚主义运动中党和同志们的帮助和教育，感激毛主席党中央的英明的方针和指示，我有决心也有信心彻底改正错误，彻底改造和不断提高自己。
