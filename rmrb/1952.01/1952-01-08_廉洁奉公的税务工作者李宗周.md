Li Zongzhou, deputy leader of the Second Tax Collection Group of the Jinan Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau and a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, was rewarded at the Second Jinan Municipal Youth League Member Representative Congress in mid-December of last year. This was because he consistently demonstrated the excellent qualities that a People's Government worker and Youth League member should possess in his work. He conscientiously reported illegal acts of merchants offering bribes and evading or underpaying taxes, and investigated corruption by government agencies and enterprise staff members from tax evasion and underpayment cases, safeguarding state property.

In August 1950, based on tip-offs from the public, Li Zongzhou discovered a case of drivers (retained personnel) stealing and selling gasoline. He was determined to investigate thoroughly. However, because the gasoline stolen and sold by the drivers could not be found in the accounts of the automobile company, Li Zongzhou first went to the manager of Yuanxing Oil Company, one of the gasoline companies in Jinan, and repeatedly educated him. Li Zongzhou talked from 1:00 PM to 11:00 PM, explaining the policies of the People's Government, which finally led the manager of Yuanxing Oil Company to confess that he had bought four large barrels of gasoline from Hongyuan Automobile Company. That night, Li Zongzhou went to Hongyuan Automobile Company to inquire. After several days of education, the manager of Hongyuan Automobile Company revealed the fact that more than forty drivers from eleven agencies at the provincial and municipal levels in Shandong Province and Jinan City were stealing and selling gasoline. Li Zongzhou immediately notified the relevant units of these situations, enabling the administrative departments of each unit to deal with the drivers who stole and sold gasoline in a timely manner. At the same time, the relevant oil companies and automobile companies also signed guarantees that they would no longer collude with drivers to steal and sell gasoline; more than fifty large barrels of gasoline illegally purchased by the oil companies and automobile companies in the past were also returned to the public.

In May 1951, while investigating a tax evasion case at the Jinan Dagong Electrical Appliance Store, Li Zongzhou discovered blank invoices without tax stamps issued by the Jinan Sales Department of the Shandong Electrical Appliance Factory under the Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee. These invoices did not conform to the government's prescribed format, nor did they list the relevant items of goods sold. Li Zongzhou immediately took this document to the sales department for verification. Yin Jieran, the director of the sales department, initially prevaricated, saying that he "didn't understand tax law." After checking the accounts, Li Zongzhou found that the department's accounts and delivery slips did not match, and that more than seven million yuan in taxes had been evaded. Li Zongzhou then earnestly inquired from all parties and proved that Yin Jieran had accepted bribes from private merchants and sold two telephone switchboards, three thousand kilograms of aluminum plates, and more than three hundred telephones under the guise of scrap. Based on the information Li Zongzhou had learned, the Shandong Office of the Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee conducted an investigation and punished the corrupt element Yin Jieran according to law.

In the tax investigation, Li Zongzhou demonstrated a firm revolutionary stance and an excellent work style of honesty and integrity. In January 1951, when he was investigating a tax evasion case at the Lu Da Commercial Bank, the bank offered him wine and dishes several times to bribe him. He sternly refused at the time and insisted that Lu Da Commercial Bank pay more than 120 million yuan in back taxes and fines.

From May to November 1951, Li Zongzhou successively uncovered sixty-four cases of violations and tax evasion, recovering more than 200 million yuan in tax revenue for the state. Recently, he also uncovered tax evasion incidents at the Atlantic Watch Store and the Yadong Pharmacy. The Jinan Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau used these incidents to educate private merchants, promoting self-examination of accounts and payment of taxes in the city's watch and Western medicine industries.

Li Zongzhou had previously been awarded a second-class merit during the governance of the Yellow River in 1949. After he joined the Youth League, under the education of the Communist Party and the Youth League, his political awareness continued to improve. His responsible and honest spirit guaranteed that he would continuously uncover multiple cases of tax evasion, underpayment, and corruption. Therefore, at the Jinan Municipal Taxation Bureau's conference to reward model tax personnel in July 1951, Li Zongzhou was awarded the second-class merit award for the second time.

    廉洁奉公的税务工作者李宗周
    新华社记者  周琪
    济南市人民政府税务局第二稽征组副组长、中国新民主主义青年团团员李宗周同志，由于他在工作中一贯地表现了人民政府工作人员和青年团员应有的优良品质，认真地检举商人行贿和偷税、漏税的不法行为，并从偷税、漏税案件中追查政府机关、企业工作人员的贪污行为，维护了国家财产，因而在济南市去年十二月中旬召开的青年团第二次团员代表大会上，受到了奖励。
    一九五○年八月，李宗周根据群众密报，发现了一批司机（留用人员）盗卖汽油的事件，他就决心彻底追查。但是，因为司机盗卖的汽油在汽车行内无账可查，李宗周就先去找济南汽油行中的一家——源兴油行的经理，对他反复地进行教育。李宗周从下午一点钟起一直谈到夜间十一点钟，讲解人民政府的政策，终于使源兴油行经理坦白了自己曾向鸿远汽车行买过四大桶汽油。当晚，李宗周又去鸿远汽车行查询。经过几天教育以后，鸿远汽车行经理说出了山东省省一级和济南市市一级十一个机关的四十几名司机盗卖汽油的事实。李宗周把这些情况立刻通知各有关单位，使各单位行政方面对盗卖汽油的司机及时地作了处理。同时，各有关油行、汽车行也都具结保证不再勾结司机盗卖汽油；各油行、汽车行过去非法收买的五十多大桶汽油也全部退还了公家。
    一九五一年五月间，李宗周在检查济南大公电器商行漏税案件中，发现了华东军政委员会工业部山东电器厂济南营业部开出的未贴印花的白纸发票。这发票既不合于政府规定式样，也没有开列售货的有关项目。李宗周立即拿了这个单据到该营业部去查核。该营业部主任殷杰然先是推诿说“不懂税法”；经过查账以后，李宗周又发现该部账目和发货单不符，并漏税七百多万元。李宗周接着就认真地向各方查询，证明了殷杰然曾经接受私商贿赂，以废品名义卖出交换机两部、铝板三千斤、电话机三百多部。华东军政委员会工业部山东办事处根据李宗周所了解的情况进行了调查，依法惩办了贪污分子殷杰然。
    在查税中，李宗周表现了坚定的革命立场和廉洁奉公的优良作风。一九五一年一月，在他检查鲁大商行漏税案件时，该商行曾几次端上酒、菜来向他行贿。他当时严辞拒绝，并且坚持要鲁大商行补缴漏税和罚税款项一亿二千多万元。
    从一九五一年五月到十一月间，李宗周先后查获了违章漏税案六十四起，为国家追补到税款两亿多元。最近，他又查出了大西洋钟表行和亚东药房的漏税事件。济南市人民政府税务局以这一事件对私商进行了教育，推动了全市钟表、西药两行业自查账目，补缴税款。
    李宗周在一九四九年治理黄河时就曾立过二等功。当他参加了青年团以后，在共产党和青年团的教育下，政治觉悟不断提高。他那认真负责、廉洁奉公的精神，保证他连续查获了多次偷税、漏税和贪污案件。因此，在一九五一年七月间举行的济南市税务局奖励模范税务人员大会上，李宗周第二次荣获二等功的奖励。
