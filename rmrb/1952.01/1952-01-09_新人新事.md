    Combat Hero Liu Sihu Receives Warm Love from His Hometown People
    The nationally renowned combat hero Liu Sihu, taking advantage of a three-day vacation, visited his long-separated hometown – Fengzhen County, Suiyuan Province.
    Liu Sihu received a warm welcome from his mother and fellow villagers. On the day of Liu Sihu's return, Comrade Feng Zhaoxi, Secretary of the Fengzhen County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Zheng Long, Minister of the County Armed Forces, and responsible comrades from various departments, extended their regards and respects to him on behalf of the local Party committee and the people of the county. A labor model said, "You have made such great contributions to the people of the whole country, we must lead the farmers of the county to do a good job in land reform!" Fan Langxuan, a childhood friend of Liu Sihu, said, "Look how glorious Brother Sihu is! We must also work harder to serve the people!" Liu Sihu's mother, Old Lady Liu, seeing the child educated by Chairman Mao, was moved to tears and so happy that she couldn't sleep well. Pointing to the new cotton clothes she was wearing and the machine-made noodles on the ground, Old Lady Liu said with emotion, "These were all given by the government. The People's Government has truly lifted us up to the sky." Liu Sihu said, "Mom, today's glory is all given to us by Chairman Mao!" At the farewell meeting of the people of the county, Liu Sihu said with emotion, "Folks! Everyone knows that I used to be a poor child, a poor child who was looked down upon in the old society. Today, I am glorious! But my glory is also the glory of my fellow villagers! Today, you all love me so much, I will definitely work harder to practice my skills after returning to the team, and thank you fellow villagers with the determination to consolidate national defense and completely defeat American imperialism!" Finally, the villagers unanimously expressed that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, they would strive to build a new Fengzhen in a new China!

    Liu Zhou Bone Meal Factory Labor Model Yin Jicheng Appointed Deputy Director
    Editor: Labor model Yin Jicheng was originally the head of the engineering section of the Liuzhou Bone Meal Factory in Guangxi. In mid-October last year, he was promoted to deputy director. This is the result of his consistent active work. Before liberation, he actively protected the factory and made great contributions. After liberation, he improved the machine for making bone meal, which greatly increased the production rate. The year before last, he participated in the National Congress of Labor Models, Peasants, and Soldiers because of his merits. But he is not complacent, he knows that labor models must always play a leading role in all work. Since the entire factory staff responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang team, he, based on the experience of the Tianjin Bone Glue Factory, removed the gelatin from cow horns, which had always been considered waste material, to manufacture bone material. In this way, he increases the country's income by 20,000 jin of rice every year. Later, he improved the machine again, increasing the output from 1,000 jin per hour to 1,200 jin, creating the factory's highest record and greatly saving the amount of oil used for raw materials. After hearing the news that he had been promoted to deputy director, the workers unanimously said: This is not only Yin Jicheng's glory, but also the glory of all the factory's employees and the entire working class, and everyone must learn from him.

    Lu Xin Textile Mill Worker's Family Member Aunt Yin's Group Protects National Property and Receives Factory Award
    Aunt Yin, a family member of a worker at the Shandong Lu Xin Textile Mill, loves her motherland and her factory very much. In August and September last year, the factory urgently needed a group of people to pick out damaged cotton. The family members felt that the wages were low (four or five jin of grain per person per day) and were unwilling to go. Aunt Yin patiently mobilized four family members to work with her. They also, like the workers, signed a patriotic pact and launched a labor competition. The five of them did the work of twelve people. With monthly wages calculated at 100,000 yuan per person, they could save the country 2.1 million yuan in expenses in three months.
    In the work of picking cotton, Aunt Yin discovered that there were many small steel wire loops in the damaged cotton. She thought: "This thing may be useful, don't waste it." She mobilized her companions to carefully pick them out and save them. In one week, they picked out more than 6,000 steel wire loops and handed them over to the factory. When the leading cadres of the Lu Xin Textile Mill learned about this, they encouraged her, and her work enthusiasm became even higher. In twenty days, she picked up small steel wire loops worth more than one million yuan.
    In September, the Lu Xin Textile Mill promoted the Hao Jianxiu work method. Some new workers did not fully understand the significance of reducing white cotton, so they hid the white cotton they produced. When Aunt Yin discovered this, she picked up white cotton in the toilets and wall holes every day and handed it over to the factory to spin into good yarn again. In one month, she picked up more than forty jin, saving forty to fifty thousand yuan. When she picked up damaged cotton, she also picked out the stem cotton (which could still be spun into yarn), and in a few days, she picked out more than twenty jin, worth about 300,000 yuan. Aunt Yin's temporary worker group saved the country a total of more than 4 million yuan in three months. If all employees paid attention to saving every bit, how much wealth could they add to the country! Because Aunt Yin's group made contributions to the people, the administrative side and the trade union of the Lu Xin Textile Mill rewarded them, and at the same time paid more attention to the work of the families of employees.

    柳州骨粉厂劳动模范尹绩成当了副厂长
    编辑同志：劳动模范尹绩成原是广西柳州骨粉厂工务课长。去年十月中旬，他被提升为副厂长。这是他一贯积极工作的结果。解放前，他积极护厂，立了很大功劳。解放后，他改进了制造骨粉的机器，使生产率大大提高。前年，他因功参加了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。但他并不自满，他知道，劳动模范必须经常地在一切工作中起带头作用。自全厂职工向马恒昌小组应战后，他便根据天津骨胶厂的经验，把一向被认为废料的牛角，去掉胶质，制造骨料。这样，每年给国家增加二万斤大米的收入。以后，他再度改进机器，使产量从每小时一千斤提高到一千二百斤，创造了这个厂的最高纪录，大大节省了原料用油量。职工们听到他被提升为副厂长的消息后，一致表示：这不但是尹绩成的光荣，也是全厂职工和整个工人阶级的光荣，大家都要向他学习。                徐炜贤
    鲁新纱厂工人家属尹大娘小组爱护国家财产受到工厂奖励
    山东鲁新纱厂工人家属尹大娘，非常热爱祖国和自己的工厂。去年八、九月间，工厂急需一部分人拣坏花。家属们都嫌工资低（每人每天四五斤粮），不肯去。尹大娘耐心地动员了四个家属，和自己一块去工作。她们也和工人一样，订立了爱国公约，开展了劳动竞赛。她们五个人，作了十二个人的工作。每月每人工资以十万元计，三个月就可为国家节约二百一十万元的开支。
    在拣花工作中，尹大娘发现了坏花里有很多小钢丝圈，她想：“这个东西可能有用处，别浪费了。”她动员同伴们细心拣出，保存起来。一个星期，她们就拣了六千多个钢丝圈，交给了工厂。鲁新纱厂领导干部知道了这件事，鼓励了她，她的工作热情更高了，在二十天内，她又拣了约值一百多万元的小钢丝圈。
    九月份，鲁新纱厂推广郝建秀工作法。有些新工人对于少出白花的意义认识不足，因此，把自己出的白花藏起来。尹大娘发现了这件事，每天在厕所里、墙洞里拾白花，交给工厂再纺好纱。一个月中，她拾到四十多斤，节约了四、五十万元。她拣坏棉时，还把棒棉（仍能纺纱）挑出来，不几天就挑了二十多斤，约值三十多万元。尹大娘的临时工小组，三个月总共为国家节约了四百多万元。如果全体职工都注意到一点一滴的节约，能给国家增加多少财富呀！由于尹大娘小组对人民有了贡献，鲁新纱厂行政方面和工会奖励了她们，同时也更加关心职工家属工作了。
