    Xiong Jiaxing Defends Height 328

    Height 328 is an important position on the forward line of Baiyun Mountain, in front of Brothers Peak. During the defense of the Han River's south bank, Xiong Jiaxing, the political instructor of the sixth company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, led two soldiers to guard this place. The fierce battle had been going on for four days and four nights, but this position remained unmoved.

    It was at dawn on January 31, 1951, when the dying enemy concentrated an absolute advantage in manpower and, in coordination with aircraft, launched a fierce attack on the mountain. At this time, Li Gaiwen, the deputy battalion commander of the second battalion, issued the order: "We must resolutely hold the position!" "As long as I'm here, the position will be here!" Xiong Jiaxing only briefly replied with this sentence, followed by the sound of machine guns, rifles, and hand grenades firing at the enemy below the mountain. The inhumane enemy planes, in groups of three to five, circled and hovered in the air, blindly pouring down gasoline bombs, bombs, and machine gun bullets, igniting fierce fires throughout the mountains, turning the yellow earth black. However, the heroic soldiers calmly fought, repelling five frantic enemy attacks within six hours.

    At 2:00 PM, Xiong Jiaxing checked the ammunition and found that the hand grenades were used up and only a little over a hundred bullets remained. Based on the new situation, he redeployed the position: two soldiers each monitored one side, and he himself monitored the enemy at the top of the mountain. Suddenly, a communications soldier from the battalion headquarters appeared on the mountain, bringing a batch of hand grenades. Xiong Jiaxing held a Mauser pistol in his left hand and threw hand grenades with his right, successively crushing five more enemy assaults. The enemy's artillery crater became Xiong Jiaxing's fortification. Sometimes the dust raised by the shells buried him, but he stood up, shook himself off, and started fighting again. This infuriated the enemy battalion commander, who let out a strange cry, after which the enemy launched one last assault, but all they got was a mountain full of corpses. The enemy dared not attack the top of the mountain anymore.

    The results of this battle were: repelling eleven enemy attacks and annihilating more than forty American soldiers. Xiong Jiaxing was awarded a major merit. (Attached image)

### 坚守三二八高地的熊家兴

    坚守三二八高地的熊家兴
    三二八高地是白云山正面前卫阵地兄弟峰前的一个重要阵地，在汉江南岸阻击战时，志愿军某部六连指导员熊家兴带领着两个战士守卫在这里。激烈的战斗已经进行了四天四夜，但这块阵地仍屹立未动。
    是一九五一年一月三十一日的拂晓，垂死的敌人又集中了绝对优势的兵力，配合着飞机向山头猛攻。这时，二营副营长李盖文下达命令：“要坚决守住阵地！”“有我在，就有阵地在！”熊家兴只简短地回答了这么一句，接着只听见机枪、步枪、手榴弹对准山下敌人射击的声音。灭绝人性的敌机，三五成群地轮回盘旋在上空，汽油弹、炸弹、机枪子弹盲目地倾泻下来，遍山的树林燃起了烈火，黄土也变成黑色。但是，英勇的战士们沉着作战，六小时内打退了敌人五次疯狂进攻。
    下午二时，熊家兴检查了一下弹药，手榴弹已经用完，子弹仅有一百多发。根据新的情况，他从新布置了阵地：两个战士每人监视一方，他自己在山顶监视敌人。营部通讯员忽然不知从那儿钻上山来，带来了一批手榴弹。熊家兴左手持驳壳枪，右手扔手榴弹，接连又粉碎了敌人的五次冲锋。敌人的炮弹坑变成了熊家兴的工事，有时炮弹掀起来的尘土将他掩埋起来，他站起来抖一抖，重新开始战斗。这一下子，把敌营的指挥官气坏了，发出一阵怪叫声后，敌人又发起最后的一次冲锋，但它所得到的仍是遍山的死尸。敌人再也不敢向山顶进攻了。
    这一次的战果是：打退了敌人的十一次进攻，歼灭美军四十余名。熊家兴立了一大功。（附图片）
