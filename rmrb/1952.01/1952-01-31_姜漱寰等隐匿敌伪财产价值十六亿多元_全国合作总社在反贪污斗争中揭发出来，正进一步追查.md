    Jiang Shuhuan and Others Concealed Enemy and Puppet Property Worth Over 1.6 Billion Yuan
    The All-China Federation of Cooperatives Uncovered It in the Anti-Corruption Struggle, Further Investigation Underway
    In the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives uncovered the crime of Jiang Shuhuan and others, who had long concealed enemy and puppet property worth approximately 1.6 billion yuan. Jiang Shuhuan, the main corrupt element in this case, has not yet made a full and thorough confession and remains suspended from her duties for reflection. Quan Yuyuan, another corrupt element, proactively confessed the concealment process and actively reported Jiang Shuhuan and others, and is currently continuing to perform his original work.

    This small clique that had long concealed enemy and puppet property was led by Jiang Shuhuan. The group consisted of eighteen people, with Jiang Shuhuan and Quan Yuyuan working at the All-China Federation of Cooperatives.

    As early as October 1947, Jiang Shuhuan and others colluded with Quan Yuyuan and eighteen others to establish the so-called "Second Public Housing Cooperative" in Nanjing. Jiang Shuhuan took advantage of her husband, Lu Guangmian's, position as the Director of the Relief Department of the Puppet Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and used the name of a puppet organization to obtain materials worth approximately 50,000 US dollars from the Puppet Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, including mercerized carded cotton cloth, various colored fabrics, cotton, sewing machine heads, and mosquito net material. At that time, they used the proceeds from selling some of the materials and used these materials as collateral to obtain loans from the Puppet Central Cooperative Treasury to purchase a building and construct twelve bungalows. When Jiang Shuhuan went abroad to Switzerland in April 1948 to join Lu Guangmian (who was in Switzerland at the time), all these properties were handed over to another person in charge of this puppet organization, Xu Dezhu (Xu Dezhu was a secret agent and was arrested and handed over to the Qinghe Brigade for control and training after liberation), for management.

    After the liberation of Nanjing in April 1949, this puppet organization dissolved because most of its members were reactionaries. However, its property worth approximately 1,664.4 million yuan (a building, twelve bungalows, 9,854 yards of mercerized carded cotton cloth, 4,973 yards of various fabrics, six sewing machine heads, 1,032 yards of mosquito net material, etc.) was hidden and refused to be returned to the people. Niu Dingle, another person in charge of the puppet organization, changed the storage account in order to facilitate the concealment and embezzlement of materials stored in the warehouse of the Shanghai Foreign Firm Anshin Co., Ltd.

    In May 1950, Jiang Shuhuan returned to Beijing from Switzerland. In order to continue to seize this property that should have been returned to the people long ago, she first convened a meeting at the Beichengong Hotel in Dengshikou, Beijing, with the personnel involved in this fraud who were in Beijing. Afterwards, she personally went to Nanjing and Shanghai to conduct activities. In Shanghai, she stole and sold more than 3,000 yards of carded cotton cloth stored in a foreign warehouse, obtaining more than 90 million yuan. In Nanjing, she originally planned to deceive the government and request the lifting of the trusteeship of the puppet organization's real estate, but her plan did not succeed.

    After returning to Beijing from Shanghai, Jiang Shuhuan, in order to seek personal advancement, mixed into the Political Research Institute of the Revolutionary University to study. Dominated by her extremely selfish and self-serving ideology, while undergoing "ideological remolding," she also instigated people scattered in various places who had participated in the revolutionary work and were related to this matter to obtain service certificates from various service departments, hoping to deceive the Nanjing Municipal People's Government and request the lifting of the trusteeship of the puppet organization's real estate, and then seize it for herself. This attempt failed because the relevant personnel did not obtain complete certificates.

    After this batch of long-hidden enemy and puppet property was temporarily frozen by the public security organs in Shanghai and Nanjing in August 1950, Jiang Shuhuan knew about this situation, but she was still unwilling to make a thorough confession to the government. It was not until the anti-corruption struggle was launched in the All-China Federation of Cooperatives that she, following the confession of her accomplice Quan Yuyuan, stated some relevant facts in an attempt to downplay her guilt. The Economy and Thrift Inspection Committee of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives is further investigating this matter. (Jin Yu)

    姜漱寰等隐匿敌伪财产价值十六亿多元
    全国合作总社在反贪污斗争中揭发出来，正进一步追查
    中华全国合作总社在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中，揭发了姜漱寰等长期隐匿约值十六亿多元敌伪财产的罪行。这一案件中的主要贪污分子姜漱寰，还没有全部彻底坦白，仍在停职反省中；另一贪污分子权裕源，主动地交代了隐匿经过，并主动检举了姜漱寰等，现仍继续担任原工作。
    这一长期隐匿敌伪财产的小集团是由姜漱寰主持的。这个小集团共十八个人，在全国合作总社工作的有姜漱寰、权裕源两人。
    姜漱寰等远在一九四七年十月曾纠合权裕源等十八个人在南京成立所谓“第二公用住宅合作社”。姜漱寰利用她丈夫芦广绵担任伪善后救济总署赈恤厅厅长的职权，用伪社团的名义向伪善后救济总署取得约值五万美元的丝光卡机布、各色布匹、棉花、缝纫机头和蚊帐料等物资。当时他们用出卖部分物资的所得和拿这项物资作押品获得伪中央合作金库的贷款，购置楼房一所，建筑平房十二间。这些财产在姜漱寰于一九四八年四月出国去瑞士芦广绵处时（芦当时在瑞士）全部交由这个伪社团的另一负责人徐德著（徐德著系特务分子，解放后被捕交清河大队管训）代为主持。
    一九四九年四月南京解放后，这个伪社团虽然因它的大部成员是反动分子而解体，但是它的约值十六亿六千四百余万元的财产（楼房一座、平房十二间、丝光卡机布九千八百五十四码、各种布匹四千九百七十三码、缝纫机头六部、蚊帐料一千零三十二码等）则隐藏起来，拒不交还人民。该伪社团另一负责人牛鼎鄂为了便于隐匿侵吞储存在上海外商安慎股份有限公司仓库的物资，并变更了存储的户头。
    一九五○年五月姜漱寰由瑞士返国到北京。她为了继续侵占这批早应归还人民的财产，首先在北京灯市口北辰宫饭店召集在北京的曾参加这个舞弊案的人员集会计议；随后亲去南京、上海两地活动。她在上海盗卖了储存在外商仓库的卡机布三千多码，得款九千多万元。她在南京原拟进行欺骗政府、请求解除对该伪社团房产代管关系的活动，但没有如愿。
    姜漱寰由上海返北京后，为了寻求个人的出路，混入革命大学政治研究院学习。由于她极端自私自利思想的支配，在进行“思想改造”的同时，还唆使分散各地已参加革命工作的和这事有关的人员向各服务部门骗取服务证明，希图矇蔽南京市人民政府，请求解除代管该伪社团房产的关系，进而攫为己有。这一企图因有关人员取得证件不齐而落空。
    这批长期隐匿的敌伪财产，在一九五○年八月为上海、南京两地公安机关查觉而暂时冻结后，姜漱寰虽然知道这一情况，但是她还不肯向政府彻底交代；直到这次反贪污的斗争在全国合作总社展开后，她才随着同谋者权裕源的坦白而避重就轻地说出若干有关的事实。合作总社节约检查委员会对这件事正进一步追查。（近宇）
