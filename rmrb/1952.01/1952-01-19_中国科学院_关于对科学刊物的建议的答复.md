    Response to Suggestions Regarding Scientific Publications

    To the Editorial Department: The People's Daily published a letter on January 6th from comrades Wang Jiamin and Zhong Wenwei, who offered suggestions regarding the scientific journals published or printed by our Academy. We believe their suggestions are very correct. In addition to sincerely accepting and thanking them, we have decided on the following improvement measures:

    1.  "Science Bulletin" is published by our Academy, while "Natural Science" is published by the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies (hereinafter referred to as "Science Federation"). We have decided to consult with the Science Federation to either merge these two publications or make a clear division of labor.

    2.  Of the seven journals in the field of biology, four are published by specialized societies, and three are Academy publications. The content inevitably overlaps. We have decided to consult with the various societies to reduce these journals to four or five.

    3.  Of the nineteen journals edited by various research institutes of our Academy and specialized societies, some are printed in foreign languages. The original intention was to exchange them with the Soviet Union and new democratic countries. However, we now believe that this is putting the cart before the horse. Our Academy has now decided that all academic works, except those specifically intended for foreign audiences, must henceforth be primarily in Chinese, with foreign language abstracts provided separately. This decision will be communicated to all our Academy's institutes and specialized societies receiving subsidies from our Academy.

### 中国科学院  关于对科学刊物的建议的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中国科学院
    关于对科学刊物的建议的答复
    编辑同志：一月六日人民日报发表了王家民和钟文伟两同志对我院出版或印行的科学期刊提出建议的来信。我们认为他们的建议非常正确，除诚恳地表示接受和感谢外，并决定如下改进办法：
    一、“科学通报”是我院出版的，“自然科学”则是中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会（以下简称“科联”）出版的。我们决定和科联协商，把这两种刊物合并，或进行明确的分工。
    二、生物学方面的七种期刊，有四种是专门学会出版的，有三种是院刊，内容不免重复。我们决定和各学会协商，把这些期刊减少到四种或五种。
    三、我院各研究所和各专门学会主编的十九种期刊，有的用外文印行，原来的意思是准备和苏联及新民主主义国家交换用。但现在我们考虑，觉得这确是主客颠倒。我院现在已经决定：凡学术论著，除专门对外的以外，今后必须一律以中文为主，可另登外文摘要。这个决定将通知我院各所和受我院补助的各专门学会。　中国科学院
