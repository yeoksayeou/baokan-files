Promote the Advanced Working Experience of the Li Xikui Shunting Team

Li Xikui, a shunting worker at Shenyang Station of the China Changchun Railway Administration, and his shunting team created advanced working experience in the process of promoting the new shunting method, which increased work efficiency by more than 60% and accumulated a large amount of wealth for the country.

After continuous research and practice, the Li Xikui shunting team created a complete set of working experience—the Li Xikui Shunting Method. This method ensures speed and safety. The Li Xikui shunting team has strong work planning. They first implemented a "work recording system," recording the work plan arranged by the duty stationmaster every day as the goal of their daily work.

The Li Xikui shunting team also has a very tight grasp of time. In order to avoid wasting time, they implemented a "walking meeting" and a "work completion review meeting" system, using the time on the way from the station to the shunting yard and on the way home after work every day to discuss work plans and review the day's work, formulate specific plans to complete the day's work, and summarize the experience of the day's work. This is a scene of them holding a walking meeting on the way from the station to the shunting yard.

The ability of the Li Xikui shunting team to create this advanced shunting method is inseparable from the enthusiastic help of leaders and Soviet experts, as well as the active research spirit of the Li Xikui shunting team. In March 1950, when the leaders of Shenyang Station called for the trial implementation of the Soviet advanced shunting method, the Li Xikui shunting team first voluntarily requested a trial after discussion, and the leaders also sent people to help them at any time.

In order to grasp the specific situation of the shunting yard, the Li Xikui shunting team established many reasonable systems. When passing through the shunting yard, each person, according to the pre-arranged route, separately understood the vehicle situation on the shunting yard lines. This is the "contracted line system" and the "line inspection system." At the same time, they further understood the destination of the vehicles parked on each line and the restrictions on those vehicles during train marshalling. This is the "contracted area" and the "contracted restricted vehicles." This is a scene of the Li Xikui shunting team separately inspecting the vehicle situation on the lines.

Before the start of work, a small meeting is held for one minute. Each coupler reports the vehicle situation of each line to the shunter, and the shunter instructs the coupler, switchman, and driver on the work that should be done first, and decides on marshalling, dismantling, or pick-up and delivery.

Engineer Kravitz, a Soviet expert at Shenyang Station, also often went to the site to guide the Li Xikui shunting team and teach them the advanced Soviet shunting experience.

Reasonable division of labor and clear responsibilities are also one of the characteristics of the Li Xikui shunting team. The entire team has one shunter and four couplers, and specific division of labor has been carried out according to each person's abilities and expertise. The shunter is responsible for directing the shunting locomotive and controlling the overall work and time. The couplers are divided into first, second, third, and fourth hook couplers. The first hook coupler is responsible for controlling the lifting of the hook and the brake test, and the second, third, and fourth hook couplers are responsible for taking turns applying the brakes. This is a scene of the couplers applying the brakes according to the division of labor.

The Li Xikui shunting team also did a very good job in contact and cooperation. They have established a contact system with the station, dispatcher, driver, switchman, and other relevant staff, guaranteeing close cooperation with each other, so that the work can be carried out smoothly under the unified leadership of the shunter. This is a scene of using sound signals to convey contact to the switchman when the locomotive pulls the train to the pull-out line during shunting work, so that the switchman can quickly prepare the line.

When the Li Xikui shunting team first started trying the new shunting method, there was a phenomenon of chaos. During this period, not only was the train marshalling slow, but mistakes were often made and rework was required. In order to overcome these difficulties, Li Xikui not only humbly learned from technical personnel at any time, but also used models for exercises during off-duty hours, concentrating on studying train marshalling methods. This is a scene of the station education engineer explaining the new shunting method to them using models.

In order to ensure rapid and accurate shunting and avoid the danger of collision, in the process of shunting and connecting vehicles, when the locomotive is about three car lengths away from the vehicle to be connected, the coupler at the front should raise his left arm and call "three cars," and put down his left arm after calling. Other personnel should also call in the same way. When they are two or one car length away, they should also call "two cars" and "one car" in the same way to strengthen contact. This is the "three-car system."

With the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the Li Xikui shunting team adopted the Kovalev working method, concentrating the advanced working experience of several excellent Soviet shunters, such as the "flexible use of line method" and the "gravity shunting method," which constituted the Li Xikui Shunting Method. This shunting method solved many technical problems in shunting work and greatly improved work efficiency. This is a scene of the Li Xikui shunting team performing continuous gravity shunting.

After continuous efforts and research, the Li Xikui shunting team gradually overcame the phenomenon of chaos and began to be able to complete tasks on time. In order to further improve work efficiency, in addition to continuing research and establishing many reasonable working systems, the Li Xikui shunting team also humbly learned from veteran workers, did a good job in uniting the masses, and changed the erroneous idea of some workers that the new shunting method would not work. This is a scene of Li Xikui exchanging work experience with veteran shunting worker Su Baozhen during off-duty hours.

After the train marshalling work is completed, the re-inspection work is carried out. During the re-inspection, according to the principle of division of labor, the first hook coupler is responsible for inspecting the station order, area, and isolation, the second hook coupler inspects the total length and number of vehicles, the third hook coupler inspects the tail, wooden, and small vehicles, and the fourth hook coupler inspects the "?" vehicles and the sealing loading status.

These reasonable working systems and scientific working methods of the Li Xikui shunting team are of great significance for improving shunting work efficiency. The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government officially issued a circular in August 1951, instructing railway bureaus across the country to vigorously promote the advanced working experience of the Li Xikui shunting team. At the same time, a station shunting training class was held in Harbin, gathering shunting personnel from major stations across the country to participate in the study. This is a scene of Lu Zhengcao, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Railways, issuing certificates to students at the closing ceremony of the National Station Shunting Training Class.

    提高铁路调车效率缩短车辆周转时间
    ——大力推广李锡奎调车组先进工作经验——
    中国长春铁路管理局沈阳站调车员李锡奎和他的调车组，在推行新调车法过程中，创造了先进的工作经验，使工作效率提高了百分之六十以上，给国家积累了大量财富。
    李锡奎调车组经过不断的钻研实践后，创造了一套完整的工作经验——李锡奎调车法。这个工作法保证了工作的迅速和安全。李锡奎调车组的工作计划性是很强的，他们首先实行了“上班记录制度”，每天上班时将值班站长所布置的工作计划记录下来，作为每天工作的目标。
    李锡奎调车组对于时间的掌握也是十分紧凑的。他们为了不浪费时间，实行了“走道会议”和“工作完了检讨会”制度，利用从车站去调车场和每天工作完了下班的路上，一边走一边讨论工作计划和检讨一天的工作，订出完成一天工作的具体计划，总结一天工作的经验。这是他们从车站去调车场路上举行走道会议时的情形。
    李锡奎调车组能创造这一套先进的调车法，是与领导上和苏联专家的热心帮助，以及李锡奎调车组积极钻研的精神分不开的。一九五○年三月，沈阳站领导上号召试行苏联先进调车法时，李锡奎调车组经过讨论后，首先自动要求试行，同时领导上也随时派人帮助他们。
    为了掌握调车场的具体情况，李锡奎调车组建立了许多合理的制度。他们在经过调车场时，每人按照事先规定好的线路，分别了解调车场线路上的车辆情况，这就是“包线制”和“线路检查制”。同时还进一步地了解每一条线路上停放的车辆的目的地，以及那些车辆在编车时受限制等情况，这就是“包地带”和“包限制车”。这是李锡奎调车组在分别进行检查线路上车辆情况时的情形。
    工作开始前，利用一分钟的时间召开小会，各连接员向调车员报告各线车辆情况，由调车员向连接员、扳道员、司机指示首先应做的工作，并决定编组、解体或取送。
    沈阳站苏联专家克拉维茨工程师，也经常到现场去指导李锡奎调车组，教给他们苏联先进的调车经验。
    合理分工和明确责任也是李锡奎调车组的特点之一。全组有调车员一人和连接员四人，都按照各人能力和专长进行了具体的分工，调车员负责指挥调车机车和掌握整个工作及时间，连接员分为头、二、三、四钩连接员，头钩连接员掌握提钩和试闸，二、三、四钩连接员负责轮流上闸。这是连接员按照分工在上闸时的情形。
    李锡奎调车组在联系配合工作上也做得非常好。他们和车站、调度员、司机、扳道员以及其他有关工作人员，都订立了联系制度，互相保证密切配合，使工作能在调车员的统一领导下顺利进行。这是进行调车工作中机车牵引列车拉向牵出线经过扳道房时，用音响信号向扳道员传达联系，使扳道员可以迅速地准备好线路时的情形。
    李锡奎调车组刚开始试行新调车法时，曾经发生过忙乱现象，这期间不但编组列车慢，并且常常出错返工，李锡奎为了克服这些困难，除随时向技术人员虚心学习外，并在休班时间利用模型进行演习，专心钻研编车方法。这是车站教育工程师用模型给他们讲解新调车法时的情形。
    为了保证调车时迅速准确及避免发生冲撞的危险，在进行调车连挂车辆工作中，当机车与应挂的车辆相距约三辆车远的时候，应由最前面的连接员高举左臂呼“三车”，呼毕放下左臂，其他人员也这样呼叫；当相距二辆车或一辆车远的时候，也同样呼“二车”、“一车”，以加强联系，这就是“三车制”。
    李锡奎调车组在苏联专家的热心帮助下，采取了郭瓦廖夫工作方法，集中了几个优秀的苏联调车员的先进工作经验，如“活用线路法”、“溜放调车法”等，构成了李锡奎调车法。这个调车法解决了调车工作上许多的技术问题，大大提高了工作效率。这是李锡奎调车组在进行连续溜放调车时的情形。
    经过不断努力钻研后，李锡奎调车组逐渐克服了忙乱现象，开始能够按时完成任务。李锡奎调车组为了使工作效率能更进一步地提高，除继续钻研，建立了许多合理的工作制度以外，并虚心向老工友们学习，做好团结群众工作，改变了部分工人认为新调车法行不通的错误想法。这是李锡奎在休班时和老调车工友苏宝珍交换工作经验时的情形。
    编组列车工作完了后，接着就进行复检工作。复检时按照分工的原则，头钩连接员负责检查站顺、地带和隔离，二钩连接员检查计长、车数，三钩连接员检查尾、木、小型车，四钩连接员检查?字车和封印装载状态。
    李锡奎调车组这些合理的工作制度和科学的工作方法，对于提高调车工作效率是有极重大作用的。中央人民政府铁道部已于一九五一年八月正式发出通令，指示全国各铁路局应大力推广李锡奎调车组的先进工作经验，同时并在哈尔滨举办了车站调车学习班，调集全国主要车站调车人员参加学习。这是铁道部副部长吕正操在全国车站调车学习班结束仪式上发给学员证书时的情形。
