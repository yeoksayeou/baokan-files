To the Editor:
Last December 19th, the People's Daily published Comrade Meng Chi's letter criticizing "Chinese Health Magazine." I have been the editor of this magazine for ten years, and this is the first time I have received such sincere criticism, which is of great help to both me and the readers. The magazine cover was inappropriate because I focused on the art design and neglected the issue of combining science, art, and politics. That's why I used such a bad cover. This is a manifestation of my ideological paralysis. Comrade Meng Chi pointed out that the phrase "we can also see typists often like to chew gum while typing" in the article "Chewing and Work" was promoting the American and British way of life. This criticism is correct. This is because I have been too deeply influenced by the American and British bourgeois lifestyle. I did not criticize the things said in articles such as "Rewards for Diligence and Politeness," "Women Don't Like to Talk About Their Age," "A Mentally Ill Patient Breaks Into a Female Doctor's Bedroom," and "A Letter Cures a Mentally Ill Person," which is very dangerous. "Chinese Health Magazine" was founded in 1939. At that time, this magazine drew material from the American "Health" magazine and was edited in imitation of that publication. After liberation, although some improvements were made, they were still far from sufficient. This is mainly because my political consciousness is not high. For the most part, I still used the words and materials I was familiar with to edit articles, regardless of the harm to readers. In addition, I did not make a good effort to follow the general guideline of "facing workers, peasants, and soldiers" clearly pointed out by the Central Ministry of Health, so that this magazine not only could not help with health education work, but also objectively promoted the lifestyle of the American and British bourgeoisie. After this criticism and self-criticism, I am determined to study hard, transform my thinking, and thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the poisonous influence of bourgeois education. In terms of editing, I will face the masses, strengthen contact with relevant departments, and listen to valuable opinions from readers, so that I can run "Chinese Health Magazine" well under the correct guidance of the government and readers.

    我要清除所受资产阶级教育的毒素
    “中华健康杂志”编者的检讨
    编辑同志：去年十二月十九日人民日报发表了孟驰同志批评“中华健康杂志”的来信。我担任这一杂志的编辑已有十年，第一次得到真诚的批评，这对我和读者都有很大的帮助。杂志封面不合适，因为我专注意美术设计，忽略了科学、艺术应和政治结合的问题，所以采用了那样不好的封面。这是我的思想麻痹的表现。孟驰同志指出：“嚼食与工作”一文中，“我们也可看到打字员常喜在打字时嚼口香糖”一语，是为英美生活方式作宣传。这种批评是对的，这是我受英美资产阶级生活薰染过深的缘故。我对“勤劳有礼的酬报”、“女人不爱谈自己的岁数”、“精神病患者闯进女医生卧室”、“一封信治好一个精神失常的人”等文中所说的事情，都没有加以批判，确是很危险的。“中华健康杂志”在一九三九年创刊。当时这个杂志取材于美国的“健康”杂志，并且仿照那个刊物来编辑。解放以后，虽然作了一些改进，但还很不够。这主要是由于我政治觉悟不高。我多半还是利用自己所熟悉的文字和材料来编稿，而不顾及对读者有什么危害。此外，我也没有很好地遵照中央卫生部所明白指出的“面向工农兵”的总方针去努力，以致这个杂志不但不能对卫生宣教工作有所帮助，反而在客观上替英美资产阶级的生活方式作了宣传。经过这次批评和自我批评，我决心努力学习，改造自己的思想，彻底清除残存着的资产阶级教育的毒素。在编辑方面，要面向大众，除加强和有关部门的联系外，并听取读者宝贵的意见，以使自己在政府和读者的正确指导下，办好“中华健康杂志”。
