    Beware of treacherous merchants infiltrating state-owned economic organs to destroy our combat fortress from within
    One of the most insidious ways for the bourgeoisie to attack the state-owned economy is to directly infiltrate state economic organs, seize a portion of economic power, and use every possible means to infringe upon national interests, coveting the illegal interests of a few within their class. Ma Jiesan, the deputy director of the Tianjin Casing Factory of the China Animal By-Products Company, was originally a gangster merchant before liberation. After liberation, he took the opportunity to infiltrate state trade organs and enterprises. In addition to engaging in speculation and embezzlement for his own benefit, he also used his authority to leak confidential business information to serve his "old acquaintances." State-owned trading enterprises are socialist enterprises, and their task is to protect and increase the interests of the people. They must shoulder the serious task of fighting against private merchants who undermine national interests. However, the state-owned China Animal By-Products Company's Tianjin Casing Factory was controlled by a gangster merchant who became the deputy director. In this way, a breach was opened in our combat fortress from within, causing incalculable and enormous losses to state property.
    Allowing a treacherous merchant to infiltrate a state-owned trading enterprise to wantonly steal and sell state commercial secrets also exposes how serious the bureaucratic style of the leading comrades of the Central Trade Department is! The bourgeois technical viewpoint has politically paralyzed the leading comrades of the Trade Department, blindly trusting Ma Jiesan's "business technology" without seeing the essence of the "business technology" of merchants in the old society. Facts have proven that Ma Jiesan's "technology" is nothing more than colluding with private merchants to play tricks and deceive people. And when Chen Zhen, the director of the Casing Factory, reported to his superiors that Ma Jiesan was suspected of corruption, the leading comrades of the Trade Department believed that this was "old cadres excluding new cadres." If this blind bureaucratic style is not thoroughly reviewed and corrected, it will inevitably continue to cause huge losses to the country. Leading cadres of state economic organs and state-owned enterprises should all take this painful lesson to heart.

### 警惕奸商钻进国营经济机关从内部破坏我们的战斗堡垒

    警惕奸商钻进国营经济机关从内部破坏我们的战斗堡垒
    资产阶级向国营经济进攻的最狠毒的方式之一，就是直接钻到国家经济机关内部，把持一部分经济大权，利用种种可能侵害国家利益，贪图他们本阶级中少数人的非法利益。中国畜产公司天津肠衣厂副厂长马杰三，解放前原来就是一个流氓奸商。解放后，他乘机钻进国家贸易机关和企业，除了自己投机倒把，贪污自肥，同时还利用他的职权，泄露商情秘密，为他的“老相识”们服务。国家贸易企业是社会主义性质的企业，它的任务是保护和增进人民的利益，它要担负起和破坏国家利益的一些私商进行斗争的严重任务。可是，国营中国畜产公司天津肠衣厂却被流氓奸商掌握了大权，做了副厂长。这样，我们的战斗的堡垒就被他们从内部攻破了一个缺口，使国家财产受到难以计算的巨大损失。
    让一个奸商侵入国营贸易企业肆意盗卖国家商情机密，这也暴露了中央贸易部的领导同志的官僚主义作风是多么严重！资产阶级的技术观点使贸易部的领导同志在政治上麻痹起来，盲目地信任马杰三的“业务技术”，而看不见旧社会的商人的“业务技术”的本质是什么。事实已经证明了马杰三的“技术”不过是勾结私商，捣鬼骗人。而当肠衣厂正厂长陈震向上级报告马杰三有贪污嫌疑时，贸易部领导同志还认为这是“老干部排斥新干部”。这种盲目的官僚主义作风如果不彻底检讨改正，必然会继续给国家造成巨大的损失。国家经济机关和国营企业的领导干部，都应记取这个惨痛的教训。
