The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government issued a "Notice on Implementing Inspection of the Use of Social Welfare Funds" on December 24, 1951, requiring all regions to seriously inspect corruption, waste, and other phenomena in the use of social welfare funds.

In order to understand the situation of social welfare fund usage in various regions, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, in July 1951, circulated to all regions a report from the Civil Affairs Department of the Central-South Military and Political Committee on the chaotic situation regarding the use of 1950 social welfare funds in eight units under the jurisdiction of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Wuhan provinces and cities, and instructed all regions to learn from the methods of the Central-South Military and Political Committee to conduct an inspection. Recently, the Civil Affairs Department of the Central-South Military and Political Committee inspected the use of social welfare funds in Henan, Hunan, Guangdong provinces and Guangzhou city; Fujian Province, Songjiang Province, Nanjing City, and Shanghai City also conducted similar inspections. According to the inspection results, the phenomena of corruption, waste, embezzlement, and misuse of social welfare funds in various regions are quite serious. Henan Province used more than 660 million yuan of social relief funds for printing land certificates, purchasing goods in Shanghai, and advancing enrollment fees. Cadres also frequently borrowed from social welfare funds. The Chenliu Special District used the interest from social welfare funds to purchase cultural and entertainment supplies and transferred it for office expenses. Xiangcheng County charged all non-reimbursable expenses (such as overspending on food, cadre subsidies, and photo fees for the county head's transfer) to the social welfare fund. Poyang County in Jiangxi Province used more than 28,000 catties of relief grain to build a theater. Some village cadres in Yuanzhou Special District controlled relief grain and distributed it to relatives and friends. A cadre in Luxi District of Shanggao County embezzled 3 shi of loan grain and spent it on courting a landlord's daughter. More seriously, the Civil Affairs Department of Guangdong Province deposited 290 million yuan of preferential treatment funds into a bank to earn interest, and used more than 880,000 yuan of interest from social relief funds to purchase thermos bottles, teacups, and maps, as well as to cover travel expenses for official business trips, which affected the progress of preferential treatment and relief work. The annual expenses of the Huanggang Prefectural Commissioner's Office Guesthouse in Hubei Province were all advanced from social welfare funds. Huangpi County used 5,000 catties of social relief grain and old revolutionary base area relief grain to offset public grain quotas. In Nanjing City's Production and Education Institute, there were four embezzlement incidents in one year, with more than 19.35 million yuan embezzled; public property was stolen or lost seven times, worth more than 10.59 million yuan. Yao Xu, the deputy district chief of the Fourth District of Nanjing City (who has been investigated and dealt with by the government), embezzled more than 73 million yuan and 1,000 catties of rice (mainly preferential treatment funds) in one year for speculative business and drug trafficking. Chen Binghuang, the deputy district chief of Luoyang District in Hui'an County, Fujian Province, embezzled 900 catties of relief grain, and Guo Chuici, the director of the Baiqi Farmers' Association in the Fifth District, embezzled 700 catties of relief grain. We cannot ignore such facts.

In order to combine this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to thoroughly inspect corruption and waste in the use of social welfare funds in various regions, especially the phenomenon of arbitrarily embezzling and hoarding relief grain and funds, infringing upon the interests of the masses, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government issued another "Notice on Implementing Inspection of the Use of Social Welfare Funds" on December 24 last year. The notice pointed out: Provinces and regions that have not yet conducted inspections should quickly organize relevant departments such as civil affairs and finance to conduct a serious inspection; appropriate measures should be taken to deal with problems related to corruption, waste, and bureaucracy found during the inspection; the inspection results should be reported before the end of January 1952.

    中央人民政府内务部通知各地
    结合反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动检查社会事业费使用中的贪污浪费
    中央人民政府内务部在一九五一年十二月二十四日发出“关于贯彻检查社会事业费使用情况的通知”，要求各地认真检查社会事业费使用上的贪污浪费等现象。
    中央人民政府内务部为了解各地使用社会事业费的情况，曾在一九五一年七月把中南军政委员会民政部检查湖北、江西、武汉等省、市所属八个单位关于一九五零年度社会事业费使用上的紊乱情况通报各地，并令各地学习中南军政委员会的办法进行一次检查。最近中南军政委员会民政部又检查了河南、湖南、广东三省和广州市使用社会事业费的情况；福建省、松江省、南京市、上海市也同样进行了检查。根据检查结果来看，各地在使用社会事业费中的贪污、浪费、挪用、乱用的现象是相当严重的。河南省印土地证、到上海采买物品以及垫支招生费等共动用社会救济事业费六亿六千多万元。干部也经常借支社会事业费。陈留专区用社会事业费的利息购买文化娱乐用品及移作办公费。襄城县把凡不能报销的款项（如超支菜金、干部补助费、县长调动工作照像费等）都在社会事业费项下开支。江西省鄱阳县用救济粮二万八千多斤修建戏院。袁州专区部分村干部把救济粮控制起来，分给亲友。上高县芦席区一个干部挪用贷款粮三石，花费在和地主女儿搞恋爱上。更严重的是广东省民政厅把优抚事业费二亿九千万元存入银行吃利息，另把社会救济事业费的利息八十八万多元购买热水瓶、茶杯、地图以及开支因公外出的车费，以致影响了优抚、救济工作的进行。湖北省黄冈专署招待所的全年经费都是由社会事业费垫支的。黄陂县把社会救济粮和老根据地救济粮五千斤抵交公粮。南京市生产教养院所属单位在一年中发生四次贪污事件，计被贪污一千九百三十五万多元；被窃及遗失公物有七次之多，计值一千零五十九万多元。南京市第四区副区长姚旭（已被政府查办），一年来共挪用公款（主要是优抚款）七千三百多万元、大米一千斤，作经营投机商业和贩卖毒品等之用。福建省惠安县洛阳区副区长陈炳煌贪污救济粮九百斤，第五区白奇保农会主任郭捶慈贪污救济粮七百斤。我们对这类事实是不能忽视的。
    为结合这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，彻底检查各地在使用社会事业费中的贪污、浪费现象，尤其是随意挪用、积压不放救济粮款的侵害群众利益的现象，中央人民政府内务部在去年十二月二十四日又发出“关于贯彻检查社会事业费使用情况的通知”。通知指出：还没有进行检查的省、区要迅速组织民政、财政等有关部门认真地进行一次检查；检查出有关贪污、浪费、官僚主义等问题，要作适当处理；检查结果要在一九五二年一月底以前上报。
