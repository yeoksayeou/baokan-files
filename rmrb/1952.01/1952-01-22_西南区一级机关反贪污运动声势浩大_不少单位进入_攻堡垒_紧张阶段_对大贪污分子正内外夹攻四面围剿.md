The mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in first-level organs of the Southwest Region has fully unfolded with great momentum. Many units have entered the tense stages of "key breakthroughs" and "fortress assaults." By January 10th, it was discovered that units directly under the military region had wasted more than 165 billion yuan of state property in the past two years. There were also many corrupt elements who confessed voluntarily or were exposed. In the organs directly under the Military and Administrative Committee, confessed and exposed embezzlements totaled over 2.83 billion yuan. In the Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Trade, and Ministry of Finance, many major cases were discovered. In the Ministry of Finance alone, three major cases were uncovered, including the case of Yu Jinghuan, chief of the disbursement section of the Grain Bureau, who stole 100,000 catties of public grain from the state treasury. These major cases generally involve a wide range of people, and the main perpetrators are unwilling to confess. In the end, they are all exposed by the masses. To quickly clarify these cases, each ministry, on the one hand, sent the main criminals and related unscrupulous merchants to the people's courts for trial and punishment; on the other hand, organized "external teams" to investigate materials in relevant factories and shops, in order to conduct a pincer attack and all-round "encirclement" of corrupt elements. Currently, the Military and Administrative Committee system has arrested sixteen major corrupt elements, and the military region system has also sent some corrupt elements to military tribunals for handling.

From inside the Party to outside the Party, from higher levels to lower levels
The mass struggle enters an unprecedented high tide

The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the first-level organs of the Southwest Administrative Region began in December of last year. At that time, mobilization was carried out among Party members, League members, and organ cadres, and the widespread phenomena of corruption and waste were exposed, making people aware of the harm and seriousness of corruption and waste. This laid the organizational and ideological foundation for carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement vigorously and swiftly. When the Central Committee further instructed that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement must fully mobilize the masses, the Southwest Administrative Region decided to fully mobilize the masses before January 10th. It was also decided that if the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in a unit was not carried out or was not carried out well, the leaders of that unit would be dismissed or even punished. At the same time, those who were not active in leading the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle before the New Year, who were not clean themselves, and who refused to allow the masses to expose them, were ordered to suspend their duties and reflect. At a cadre meeting of organs directly under the military region, Comrade He Long specifically named Yao Jiming, deputy director of the Logistics Department of the military region, and four others to suspend their duties and reflect. A total of 167 people in the Military and Administrative Committee system were successively dismissed or suspended from administrative duties. All units convened general staff meetings or military personnel meetings, calling on corrupt elements to confess voluntarily and calling on all personnel to expose corrupt elements. In addition, some units set up secret boxes for reporting corrupt elements; some units suspended spare-time political and cultural studies, or, without affecting work, set aside half a day or even a full day of office time to carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle. Many enterprises also published notices in newspapers welcoming mass reports. In addition to reporting on the dynamics of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement on entire pages, the Chongqing Xinhua Daily also opened a special column on the front page entitled "Everyone Exposes Corrupt Elements." As a result, from inside the Party to outside the Party, from inside the organs to outside the organs, from senior cadres to staff members, soldiers, odd-job workers, and even some organ family members and nannies, all were involved in the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Xie Jingyi, who used to work in the Grain Bureau and had retired to his hometown, specifically came from northern Sichuan to expose corrupt elements. Many organs saw patriotic actions of wives exposing their husbands or persuading their husbands to confess. At an anti-corruption struggle meeting in a certain enterprise, one person after another exposed the corrupt element Lan Qiliang, and more than one hundred slips of paper requesting to speak were piled up, but Lan Qiliang insisted that he had not embezzled anything. His wife, Zhou Guangjie, angrily took the stage and exposed the fact that Lan had colluded with unscrupulous merchants to sell opium, and on the spot handed over one tael of gold and a radio embezzled by Lan Qiliang. Many organs held confession and exposure meetings with two or three thousand people, and no one left midway after eight or nine hours. Cooks also participated in the exposure during their cooking breaks. This has brought the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle in the first-level organs of the Southwest Administrative Region to an unprecedented high tide, making unprecedented achievements. For example, the General Office of the Military and Administrative Committee handled the corruption of nineteen people in the early stage of the movement, and many people said: "We only have these nineteen here, no more!" But after the masses rose up, the number of people who confessed voluntarily and were exposed increased to more than one hundred.

Major corrupt elements are mostly unwilling to confess
Mass pressure and legal sanctions must be given

The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the organs directly under the Southwest Region proves that without a vigorous mass movement, it is impossible to discover major corruption cases; strong mass pressure must be combined with legal sanctions; and while punishing corrupt elements, unscrupulous merchants who create the conditions for corruption must be severely punished. So far, the larger corrupt elements in the organs of the Southwest Administrative Region are mostly exposed or deny the charges. These major corrupt elements are all connected with unscrupulous merchants. In the anti-corruption struggle, they made a "common defense alliance." For example, Yu Jinghuan, who stole 100,000 catties of public grain, did not confess himself; and the unscrupulous merchants who sold this batch of grain were willing to compensate in full, but were unwilling to expose the mastermind who stole the public grain. Under such circumstances, if corrupt elements are not severely punished and unscrupulous merchants are not given legal sanctions, the surging mass enthusiasm will cool down, and the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement will be delayed. The Southwest leadership organs quickly arrested this group of major corrupt elements who refused to confess, and the movement moved to a new high tide.

The leadership should fully support the masses
Everyone should be educated and every place should be inspected

In carrying out the mass anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the most successful aspect of the Southwest leadership organs is that the leadership supports the masses, and the leaders personally "go to the front line." Comrade He Long, commander of the military region, is a model of personally "going to the front line." Comrade He Long's health was not very good, but since the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched, he has participated in and presided over large and small meetings of the organs directly under the military region, sometimes listening to reports for six hours in a row. After listening to the reports, he often made specific arrangements based on the Central Committee's policies and Chairman Mao's instructions; and proposed that "everyone must be educated and every place must be inspected." Therefore, he not only paid attention to the ideological leadership of the movement, but also personally inspected the large and small warehouses and all the camp buildings of the organs directly under the military region. When he found that some materials were piled up in the open fields, he immediately ordered the relevant departments to store them in the warehouses. The person in charge of the military region's savings inspection committee said when talking about Comrade He Long's exemplary role: Without Commander He's personal "going to the front line," the struggle against corruption and waste in the organs directly under the military region would not have achieved such results today.

    西南区一级机关反贪污运动声势浩大
    不少单位进入“攻堡垒”紧张阶段
    对大贪污分子正内外夹攻四面围剿
    西南区一级各机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的群众性的运动，已全面展开，声势浩大；不少单位已进入“重点突破”和“攻堡垒”的紧张阶段。到一月十日为止，已检查出：军区直属机关各单位在近二年内，浪费国家财产一千六百五十多亿元；自动坦白和被检举出来的贪污分子也不少。军政委员会直属各机关，已坦白和被检举出来的，共贪污公款二十八亿三千多万元。在工业部、卫生部、公安部、贸易部和财政部都发现不少重大案件，只财政部就发现粮食局支拨股股长于敬寰，盗窃国库公粮十万斤等三大案件。这些重大案件，一般的都牵联很广，而主事人又死不肯坦白，最后都是群众检举出来的。各部为迅速弄清这些案件，一方面把主犯和有关的奸商送交人民法院审讯处理；一方面组织了“外勤队”到各有关的工厂和商店调查材料，以对贪污分子进行内外夹攻，四面“围剿”。现军政委员会系统已逮捕了大贪污犯十六名；军区系统也把若干贪污分子送交军事法庭处理。
    从党内到党外，从上级到下级
    群众性的斗争进入空前的高潮
    西南大行政区一级各机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，是从去年十二月开始的。当时曾在党员、团员和机关干部中做了动员，对普遍存在的贪污浪费现象进行了揭露，使人们认识了贪污浪费的危害和严重性，为大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动做了组织准备和思想准备。当中央进一步指示反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动必须充分发动群众的时候，西南大行政区就决定在一月十日前全面把群众发动起来；并决定：如果那一单位的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动没有开展或开展得不好，就要撤销以至惩办那一单位的领导人。同时又指令年前领导反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争不积极、自身不干净、又拒绝群众检举的人，停职反省。在军区直属机关的干部大会上，贺龙同志便指名要军区后勤部副部长姚继鸣等四人停职反省。军政委员会系统先后被撤销与停止行政职务的有一百六十七人。各单位都召开了全体工作人员大会或军人大会，号召贪污分子自动坦白；号召所有人员起来检举贪污分子。此外，有的单位特设了检举贪污分子密告箱；有的单位停止了业余时间的政治文化学习，或在不影响工作的情况下，抽出半天、甚而整天的办公时间，进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争。许多企业部门还在报纸上刊登了欢迎群众检举的启事。重庆新华日报除整张整版地报道反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的动态外，又在第一版新辟了“人人都来检举贪污分子”的专栏。于是，从党内到党外，从机关内到机关外，从高级干部到工作人员、战士、勤杂人员，以至某些机关家属和媬姆，全都卷入了伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争。原在粮食局工作、曾经退职还乡的谢静一，特地从川北赶来检举贪污分子。许多机关出现了妻子检举丈夫或劝说丈夫坦白的爱国行动。某企业机关的反贪污斗争大会上，检举贪污分子蓝其良的人一个跟着一个，要求发言的条子堆了一百多张，但蓝其良一口咬定没有贪污。他的妻子周光洁愤而登台，揭发了蓝与奸商合伙贩卖鸦片的事实后，并当场交出蓝其良贪污的一两黄金、一架收音机。许多机关召开二、三千人的坦白检举大会，连开八、九个钟头无一人中途退席。炊事员也在做饭间隙参加检举。这样就使西南大行政区一级各机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争进入前所未有的高潮，做出前所未有的成绩。如军政委员会办公厅，曾在运动初期处理了十九个人的贪污事实，不少人说：“我们这里就这十九个，再没有了！”但群众起来后，自动坦白和被检举的人数增至一百多人。
    大贪污分子多是不肯坦白的
    必须给以群众压力法律制裁
    西南区直属机关反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的斗争证明：没有声势浩大的群众运动，就不可能发现重大的贪污案件；强大的群众压力，又必须和法律制裁相结合；在惩办贪污分子的同时，必须给制造贪污条件的奸商以严惩。到目前为止，西南大行政区各机关中较大的贪污分子多是被检举或死不认账的。而这些大贪污分子又都是和奸商有联系。他们在反贪污斗争中，订了“共守同盟”。比如盗走十万斤公粮的于敬寰，自己不坦白；而贩卖这批粮食的奸商，宁愿如数赔偿，却不愿暴露出偷窃公粮的主谋人。在这种情况下，如不给贪污分子以严惩，不给奸商以法律制裁，高涨着的群众热情就会冷却下去，反贪污反浪费运动也会因此迟滞下来。西南领导机关迅速逮捕了这批拒不坦白的大贪污犯后，运动就走向新的高潮。
    领导方面要全力给群众撑腰
    要使人人受教育处处受检查
    在开展群众性的反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中，西南领导机关最成功的地方是领导方面给群众撑腰，首长亲自“上前线”。军区司令员贺龙同志就是亲自“上前线”的典范。贺龙同志的身体本来不太好，但自反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动开展以来，他参加并主持了军区直属机关的大小会议，有时一连听取六个钟头的汇报。他听了汇报后，常常根据中央的方针和毛主席的指示，进行具体的布置；并提出：必须使“人人受到教育，处处受到检查”。所以他不但注重运动的思想领导，而且亲自检查了军区直属机关的大小仓库和所有的营房建筑。当他发现有些物资堆积在露天旷野的时候，他便立即命令有关部门收藏到仓库里去。军区节约检查委员会负责人，谈到贺龙同志的模范作用时说：要没有贺司令员的亲自“上前线”，军区直属机关反贪污、反浪费的斗争，是得不到今天这样的成绩的。　（林里）
