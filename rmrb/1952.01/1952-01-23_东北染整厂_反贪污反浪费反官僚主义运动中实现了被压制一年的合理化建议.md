Northeast Dyeing and Finishing Factory

Rationalization Proposals Suppressed for a Year Implemented During the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign

Xinhua News Agency

During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, the Northeast Dyeing and Finishing Factory implemented the rationalization proposal of "waste dye recovery" which had been suppressed for a year, saving the equivalent of more than 400 tons of grain per month.

This factory used a relatively expensive dye called "sulfurized khaki" to dye cloth, and in the past, the waste dye liquor was discarded after each dyeing. This phenomenon caught the attention of dyeing worker Ji Juntian in October of the year before last. He took a piece of white cloth and tested it, proving that the remaining waste dye liquor could still dye cloth, and proposed the suggestion of using waste dye liquor to the technician. Technician Liu Dezhang believed that dyeing several times would affect the quality of the colored cloth and did not pay attention to this suggestion at all. A few days later, Ji Juntian, through the trade union, proposed this suggestion to the factory director. Factory Director Zhao Qiren thought that the question was raised too vaguely and said that he would "wait until a specific method is thought of." Later, with the support of the Chinese Communist Party branch and the trade union, Ji Juntian requested the administrative side to conduct an experiment, and the dyed cloth turned yellow. Technician Liu impatiently said, "I said it won't work, it just won't work." However, Ji Juntian couldn't bear to see the state's assets flowing out along the ditch day and night. After discussing with his co-workers, they all felt that using waste dye liquor as a raw material was better than using plain water, so they proposed to the administration to set up tanks to store the waste dye liquor. But Factory Director Zhao still did not pay attention to his suggestion, saying, "Installing tanks is too expensive and not worth it." Technician Liu said, "Storage is also not feasible, it will cause chemical changes." So this matter was shelved.

During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, Factory Director Zhao, after studying, criticized his bureaucratic style of blindly trusting technicians, not relying on workers, and not paying attention to rationalization proposals at the employee representative meeting, and this suggestion finally attracted attention. Subsequently, technical personnel also actively worked with workers to study how to adjust dyes and control temperature and water volume. After dozens of experiments, it finally succeeded, and dyes and chemicals could be saved by 20%, saving the country more than 259 million yuan per month, equivalent to more than 400 tons of grain.

    东北染整厂
    反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中实现了被压制一年的合理化建议
    东北染整厂在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中，实现了被压制一年的“废染液回收”合理化建议，每月可节约四百多吨粮食的价值。
    这个厂使用一种较贵重的染料“硫化卡叽”染布，过去每染一次就把废染液放掉。这种现象在前年十月里就引起了染色工人季君田的注意。他拿块白布试了一下，证明剩下的废染液还能染布，就向技师提出利用废染液的建议。技师刘德章认为多染几次会影响色布质量，根本不重视这个建议。过了几天，季君田又通过工会，向厂长提出这项建议。厂长赵启人认为问题提得太笼统，说要“等想出具体办法再说”。后来，季君田在中共支部和工会支持下，要求行政方面进行一次实验，结果染出的布发黄。刘技师就不耐烦地说：“我说不行就是不行。”但季君田看到国家的资财日夜不息地顺着地沟流出去，实在忍耐不住。他和工友们研究后，都觉得用废染液下料总比用白水下料好，就又向行政提议设槽子储藏废染液。但赵厂长仍不重视他的建议，说：“安设槽子太费钱，不值得。”刘技师说：“储藏也不行，会发生化学变化。”于是这件事就被搁下了。
    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中，赵厂长经过学习，在职工代表会议上检讨了片面相信技师、不依靠工人、不重视合理化建议的官僚主义作风后，这个建议才引起重视。接着技术人员也积极地和工人共同研究怎样调剂染料、掌握温度和水量。经过数十次试验，终于成功，染料和药料可以节省百分之二十，每月可为国家节省两亿五千九百多万元，折合粮食四百多吨。　（新华社）
