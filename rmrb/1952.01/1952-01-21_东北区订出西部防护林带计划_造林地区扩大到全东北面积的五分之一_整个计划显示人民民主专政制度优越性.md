    Northeastern Region Formulates Western Shelterbelt Plan
    Afforestation Area Expanded to One-Fifth of Total Northeast Area
    The Entire Plan Demonstrates the Superiority of the People's Democratic Dictatorship
    The Forestry Department of the Northeast People's Government convened an enlarged meeting on December 24, 1951, to discuss and approve the Northeast Region Western Shelterbelt Construction Plan. Participants included personnel from the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government, the Statistics Bureau of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as responsible cadres from the Northeast Economic Planning Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Water Conservancy Bureau, the Highway Bureau, the Railway Bureau, and over 140 individuals including county heads, forestry directors, and model workers from western counties of Northeast China. During the meeting, Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, and Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman, both attended and delivered reports. The meeting lasted four days, during which everyone engaged in enthusiastic discussions and research and unanimously expressed their support for this great plan.
    At the beginning of the meeting, Liu Peizhi, Acting Minister of the Forestry Department of the Northeast People's Government, gave a detailed report. He emphasized the great significance and goals of constructing the western shelterbelt in the Northeast Region. He stated: The formulation of the Northeast Region Western Shelterbelt Construction Plan marks the beginning of our country's large-scale afforestation and transformation of nature, and the fight against natural disasters. This plan symbolizes the brilliant future of our great motherland's economic construction and demonstrates the superiority of our country's new democratic social system. The vast western regions of Northeast China have suffered greatly from wind, sand, waterlogging, and drought over the years, causing significant losses to the people's lives and health. The successful completion of the great shelterbelt plan will not only reduce natural disasters and ensure bumper harvests, but also expand cultivated land area and improve people's living standards; at the same time, it can meet the people's need for timber.
    Acting Minister Liu also gave a brief account of the scale of this plan. He said: This plan is developed and expanded on the basis of the original West Manchuria Shelterbelt Plan. The scope is more than doubled compared to the original plan. The original shelterbelt covered twenty-one counties and banners (including four counties and banners in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region), with a total area of 8.6 million hectares, of which 1 million hectares were to be afforested. This shelterbelt only included the main areas affected by wind and sand in central West Manchuria and did not cover all areas affected by wind and sand disasters. In order to expand the scope of wind prevention, flood control, tide prevention, and hurricane prevention, and to increase the protective effect, the Northeast People's Government dispatched more than 100 forestry cadres to Liaoxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and other provinces after July 1950 to assist local governments in surveying. The surveying work was completed in August 1951, extending the original plan to the north and south, widening it to the east and west, and adding a coastal defense forest belt, resulting in the Northeast Region Western Shelterbelt Plan. The overall scale of this plan is: starting from the Liaodong Peninsula and Shanhaiguan in the south, and extending to Fuyu, Gannan, and other counties south of the Xing'an Mountains in the north, with a total length of 1,100 kilometers and a maximum width of over 300 kilometers. In addition to the twenty-one counties and banners included in the original plan, thirty-nine counties and banners have been added. Specifically: eleven counties in Heilongjiang Province, six counties in Liaoxi Province, three counties in Jilin Province, four counties in Rehe Province, three banners in Inner Mongolia, and the coastal defense forest includes five counties in Liaoxi Province, six counties in the Liaodong Peninsula, and the Lushun-Dalian area. The total area is 20 million hectares, accounting for more than one-fifth of the total area of Northeast China. The afforestation area is approximately 3 million hectares. In addition, flood control forests, sand fixation forests, pasture forests, and road protection forests will be built simultaneously within the shelterbelt to enhance the functions of water control, sand prevention, animal husbandry, and road protection. It is estimated that after fifteen years of forest growth, the natural environment of the western region will be fundamentally changed. The vast plains and desert areas will gradually become fertile land and excellent forest farms, farms, and pastures. The effect of the original West Manchuria shelterbelt alone can increase the yield of the existing 1.8 million hectares of cultivated land by more than 30%, and also expand 1.8 million hectares of cultivated land and obtain timber income worth more than 40 million tons of grain.
    Liu Peizhi concluded by pointing out: To complete this plan, leadership should be strengthened, the masses should be relied upon, propaganda should be widely carried out to make the people understand the important significance of this plan and actively participate in this work, forming a mass seedling cultivation and afforestation movement.
    During the meeting, Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, gave many instructions. He said: This is a complex and meticulous task. All units must formulate practical and scientific plans, and check them in actual work, constantly correct and supplement the current plan to make it more perfect.
    After the meeting, a symposium was held with relevant technical personnel to study afforestation techniques and methods, which yielded great results. (Northeast Daily)

    东北区订出西部防护林带计划
    造林地区扩大到全东北面积的五分之一
    整个计划显示人民民主专政制度优越性
    东北人民政府林业部，在一九五一年十二月二十四日召开扩大会议，讨论通过东北区西部防护林带营造计划。参加会议的有中央人民政府林业部、中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会统计局、中国科学院所派的人员，东北经济计划委员会、农业部、水利局、公路局、铁路局等机关的负责干部及东北西部各县县长、林业所长、劳动模范等一百四十多人。会议中间，东北人民政府主席高岗和副主席高崇民都亲临大会作了报告。会议历时四天，大家进行了热烈的讨论和研究后，一致表示拥护这个伟大的计划。
    大会首先由东北人民政府林业部代部长刘培植作了详细的报告。他着重指出营造东北区西部防护林带的伟大意义和奋斗目标。他说：东北区西部防护林带营造计划的制订，是我国大规模造林和改造自然、向自然灾害作斗争的开始。这个计划象征着我们伟大祖国经济建设的光辉前途，表现了我国新民主主义社会制度的优越性。东北西部广大地区，历年发生的风沙水旱等灾害，使广大人民在生活上、身体健康上都受到很大损失。防护林带的伟大计划如期完成后，不仅可以减免自然灾害、保证丰收，还可以扩大耕地面积，提高人民的生活；同时，又可以满足人民对于木材的需要。
    刘代部长并对这个计划的规模作了简要的叙述。他说：这个计划是在原有的西满防护林带计划的基础上发展和扩大起来的。范围比原计划扩大了一倍以上。原防护林带的范围包括二十一个县、旗（其中包括内蒙古自治区的四个县、旗），面积共计八百六十万垧，造林面积为一百万垧。这个防护林带，仅包括西满中部风沙为害的主要地区，还不是风沙灾害的全部地区。为了扩大防风、治水、防潮、防飓风的范围，增加防护效能，东北人民政府在一九五零年七月以后，就先后派出林业干部一百多人，在辽西、吉林、黑龙江等省境内，协助当地政府进行了测量工作。一九五一年八月完成勘测工作，把原计划向南北伸长、东西加宽，并增加海防林带，制成了东北区西部防护林带的计划。这一计划总的规模是：南起辽东半岛和山海关，北到兴安岭以南的富裕、甘南等县，全长一千一百公里，最宽处达三百余公里。除原计划包括的二十一个县、旗外，又增加了三十九个县、旗。计：黑龙江省十一县、辽西省六县、吉林省三县、热河省四县，内蒙三旗，另海防林有辽西省五县、辽东半岛六县及旅大市。总面积二千万垧，约占东北总面积五分之一强。造林面积约三百余万垧。此外，在防护林带内，同时营造防洪林、固沙林、牧野林、护路林，借以发挥治水、防沙、养畜、护路等作用。预计十五年成林以后，就可以根本改变西部自然环境的面貌。广大辽阔的原野和沙漠地带，将逐渐变成肥沃的土地和优良的林场、农场、牧场。仅原西满防护林带的作用，就可以使现有的一百八十万垧耕地增加百分之三十以上的收成，同时还可以扩大一百八十万垧耕地和得到值四千多万吨粮食的木材收益。
    刘培植最后指出：要完成这个计划，应当加强领导，依靠群众，广泛地进行宣传，使人民群众了解这个计划的重要意义而积极参加这一工作，形成群众性的育苗造林运动。
    会议当中，东北人民政府副主席高崇民又作了很多指示。他说：这是一件复杂而细致的工作，各单位必须制定切合实际的科学的计划，并要在实际工作中加以检查，不断地改正和补充现在的计划，使它更加完善。
    会后又召集有关的技术人员举行座谈会，研究了造林的技术和方法，有很大收获。（东北日报）
