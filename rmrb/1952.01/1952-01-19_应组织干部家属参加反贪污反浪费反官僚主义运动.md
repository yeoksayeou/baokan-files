    Cadres' Family Members Should Be Organized to Participate in the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement

    Editor: Many cadres' family members living in the dormitories of government organs often become blank spots in various great political movements. They do not have a definite organization, so they rarely receive patriotic education and have few opportunities to participate in various political activities. Now that the vigorous anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has been launched across the country, I suggest that the thrift inspection committees of all government organs should not ignore the cadres' family members living in the dormitories. They should organize them, educate them, and make them also a force in checking cadres' corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    应组织干部家属参加反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动
    编辑同志：有很多住在机关宿舍内的干部家属，在各种伟大的政治运动中，往往成了空白点。他们没有一定的组织，因此他们很少受到爱国主义教育，很少有参加各种政治活动的机会。现在大张旗鼓地反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动已在全国各地展开了，我建议各机关的节约检查委员会，不要忽视住在机关宿舍内的干部家属，应该把他们组织起来，向他们进行教育，使他们也成为检查干部贪污、浪费和官僚主义的一种力量。　章瑞年
