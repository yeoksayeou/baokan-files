[Report from this newspaper] The "Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Frontline Artifacts and Pictures Exhibition," which began on the 21st at the Beijing Municipal Labour People's Cultural Palace, closed on the 29th. A total of 38,700 people visited the exhibition in nine days. During the exhibition, a long line of visitors waiting to enter the venue was often seen at the entrance. Many visitors patiently waited in the bitter cold for two or three hours. Li, an old lady living at No. 150 Dongzhimen Avenue in Beijing, is 76 years old. In order to see the items used by the volunteer soldiers, she held onto her granddaughter and waited in line from 10:00 AM on the 25th. By the time she finished viewing the exhibition, it was almost 3:00 PM, but she was still very excited and kept saying, "Not tired, not tired!" This enthusiastic situation reflects the deep concern of the people of the motherland for the volunteer soldiers.

Every item at the exhibition attracted the people of the capital. Visitors asked many questions at the exhibition, hoping to learn more about the combat life of the volunteer soldiers. Hundreds of visitors wrote down their thoughts, believing that the exhibition was very educational, and expressed their desire to learn from the heroic spirit and creativity of the volunteer soldiers. Many visitors said after visiting the exhibition that they would actively participate in the current movement to increase production and practice economy, and to oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. One visitor wrote: "After seeing these things, I feel proud because the motherland has such excellent sons and daughters; at the same time, I also feel very sad. Our most beloved people cherish every blade of grass and tree of the motherland so much, but our school wasted 1.5 billion and embezzled nearly 100 million." He sternly questioned: "Bureaucrats, what face do you have to meet the volunteer comrades?" A staff member from the Jinmen Canal Engineering Office reviewed his own behavior after visiting the exhibition, realizing that he had caused a lot of waste due to poor planning. He believed that the exhibition "gave me a lesson and deeply stung my bureaucratic style." Another visitor said: "In the past, I thought that I had done my best to save wealth for the country by using broken office supplies in the organization, and I felt that I had achieved results; today, after seeing this exhibition, I feel that my achievements are really too insignificant. After returning, I will widely spread the spirit of the volunteer soldiers." Han Zhenhua, a worker from a private factory, said: "We must expose illegal capitalists in order to be worthy of the heroic volunteer soldiers."

The exhibits and pictures have now been divided into six batches and will be transported to major administrative regions across the country with the returning delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the delegation of the Korean people visiting China. The precious items, of which there is only one of each, have been photographed and will be exhibited in various places.

    抗美援朝前线实物图片展览闭幕
    九天内参观者近四万
    展品将分运全国各地展览
    【本报讯】从二十一日开始在北京市劳动人民文化宫举行的“抗美援朝前线实物及图片展览”，已于二十九日闭幕。九天中参观这一展览的观众，共有三万八千七百多人。展览期间，会场门口经常排列着一长队等待挨次入场的观众。许多观众耐心地在寒风凛冽中等上两三个钟头。住在北京东直门大街一百五十号的李老太太，已七十六岁了，为了看志愿军亲手用的东西，在二十五日扶着自己的外孙女，从早上十点站队等起，看完展览已经快到下午三点，但她还是很兴奋，连称“不累，不累！”这种热烈情况，反映了祖国人民对志愿军的深切关怀。
    展览会上的每一件东西，都吸引了首都的人民。观众在会上问长问短，都希望能够更多地知道志愿军的战斗生活。数百名观众写下了自己的感想，认为这次展览的教育意义很大，并表示要学习志愿军的英雄气概和创造精神。许多观众在参观展览后，表示要积极参加当前的增产节约和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动。一位观众写道：“看到了这些东西，我感到骄傲，因为祖国有这么优秀的儿女；同时我也很难受，我们的最可爱的人是这样珍惜祖国的一草一木，可是我们学校却浪费了十五亿，贪污数字将近一亿。”他严厉地发出质问：“官僚主义者，拿什么脸见志愿军同志？”金门渠工程处一位工作人员，在参观展览会之后检讨了他由于计划不周而造成很多浪费。他认为展览会“给我上了一课，深深地刺痛了我的官僚主义作风。”另一位观众说：“过去我认为我在机关内利用坏的办公用具，替国家节省财富，已经是想尽很多办法了，而且觉得有成绩了；今天看了这个展览，使我感到自己的成绩真是太渺小了。回去后要把志愿军的这种精神，广泛地传播开来。”一位私营工厂的工人韩振华说：“咱们要检举不法的资本家，才能对得起英勇作战的志愿军。”
    展览的实物和图片，现在已分作六起，将随志愿军归国代表团与朝鲜人民访华代表团代表，分运全国各大行政区展览，其中只有一份的珍贵物品，已摄制照片，将分别携至各地展出。
