Beijing Construction Engineering Company
    Leading Cadres Should Not Protect Embezzlers

    To the Editor: Shen Hongtao, the site director, and Li Shugui and Wang Rongyao, the accountants of a certain construction site of the Beijing Construction Engineering Company, colluded to embezzle and misappropriate public funds. The No. 88 warehouse renovation project of this construction site was contracted to private merchants through Shen Hongtao's introduction. The merchants only laid oil felt once, allowing them to make a profit of more than 3 million yuan. For every project contracted, Shen adopted the method of "signing the contract after completion, guaranteeing profitability." After the completion of one project on this construction site, Shen added 3,000 yuan to the unit price of each man-day, reporting more than 30 million yuan extra to the public. Accountant Li Shugui, seeing Shen's behavior, also borrowed more than 2 million yuan of public funds in the name of getting married. Li also forged more than 300,000 yuan in payrolls, which Shen approved, and they shared the money. Accountant Wang Rongyao also misappropriated more than 600,000 yuan of public funds.

    At the beginning of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the three of them adopted a hostile attitude towards the movement. They did not participate in group meetings, emphasizing that they were busy with work. They once held a meeting to discuss and decided that "nothing should be said." The leading cadres of the Beijing Construction Engineering Company, however, adopted a protective attitude towards this erroneous behavior. Manager Cui Yingguo said: "We should take care of technical personnel." Therefore, Shen Hongtao was approved by Manager Cui to take leave and return to his hometown of Shanghai. I believe that the leading cadres of the Beijing Construction Engineering Company should make a profound self-criticism of this erroneous behavior.

    北京市建筑工程公司
    领导干部不应包庇贪污分子
    编辑同志：北京市建筑工程公司某工地主任沈洪涛、会计员李树贵、王荣耀，合伙贪污，盗用公款。这个工地的八十八号仓库修缮工程，经沈洪涛介绍包给私商，只铺油毡一次，就让私商从中取利三百多万元。沈对包做的每件工程，都是采取“完工订合同，赚钱有保证”的方式。这个工地有一项工程完工后，沈把每工单价加上三千元，共向公家多报了三千多万元。会计员李树贵看到沈的行为如此，也借结婚为名，借了公款二百多万元。李并伪造过三十多万元的工资单，经沈批准，合伙分用。会计员王荣耀也挪用公款六十多万元。
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，他们三人对这个运动采取敌对态度。他们不参加小组会，强调工作忙。他们曾开会商量，决定“任何事也不讲”。北京市建筑工程公司的领导干部，对这种错误行为却采取了包庇的态度。崔映国经理说：“我们对技术人员应该照顾照顾。”因此，沈洪涛被崔经理批准请假回上海原籍了。我认为北京市建筑工程公司领导干部对这种错误行为，应作深刻检讨。
