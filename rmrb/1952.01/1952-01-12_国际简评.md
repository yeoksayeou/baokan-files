International Brief Review

    U.S. Imperialism Intensifies Aggression Against Iran

    Representatives of the so-called "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development," an instrument for the economic expansion of U.S. monopoly capital, have arrived in Tehran, the capital of Iran, from the United States. According to these representatives, the purpose of their trip is to study Iran's oil situation in order to "formulate a plan to temporarily manage Iran's oil industry with the help of non-British foreign technicians." Prior to this, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Interior, Warne, arrived in Tehran to carry out activities as the head of the so-called "Truman Fourth Point Program" aid mission to Iran. All these signs clearly demonstrate that the aggressive clutches of U.S. imperialists are intensifying their reach into Iran.

    U.S. monopoly capital has long been envious of Iran's enormous oil interests. For a long time, U.S. oil monopolies have been trying to exclude British imperialist forces in Iran, attempting to seize Iranian oil entirely for themselves. As early as last July, Truman's special envoy Harriman, who went to Iran under the pretext of mediating the so-called British-Iranian oil dispute, openly declared in Tehran: "I intend to understand the development plan and the ways in which the United States promotes this plan." Now, the hasty visit of representatives of the U.S. "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development" to Iran further confirms the Wall Street capitalists' attempt to further plunder Iranian oil.

    One of the reasons why U.S. monopoly capital is attempting to take the opportunity to invade Iran after the British aggressive forces were driven out by the Iranian people is related to the Iranian ruling group's ambiguous attitude toward U.S. imperialism and its repressive measures against Iran's progressive forces. If the Iranian ruling group allows the U.S. "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development" to plunder the oil rights that the Iranian people have seized from British imperialism, it will place Iran's sovereignty in a more tragic position than before the British imperialist forces were driven out.

    However, the U.S. imperialists' attempt to plunder Iranian oil is bound to fail. The Iranian people have long recognized that U.S. imperialism, like British imperialism, is a deadly enemy of their nation. The intensification of U.S. aggression and the Iranian ruling group's act of betraying Iran's national interests will only make the Iranian people more vigilant and more determined to unite, to fight for the protection of Iran's national interests and the realization of Iran's true independence and autonomy. The Iranian people's patriotic movement against imperialist aggression is bound to be victorious.

    国际简评
    美帝国主义正加紧侵略伊朗
    成为美国独占资本进行经济扩张的工具的所谓“国际复兴开发银行”的代表，已由美国抵达伊朗首都德黑兰。据这些代表透露，他们此行的目的是为了研究伊朗的石油情况，以便“拟订一个计划，规定暂时在非英国的外国技师的帮助下经营伊朗的石油工业”。在此以前，前美国内政部助理部长华恩即以所谓“杜鲁门第四点计划”援助伊朗使团团长的身份，抵达德黑兰进行活动。这一切迹象都清楚地表明了：美帝国主义者的侵略魔手，正在加紧向伊朗伸入。
    美国独占资本对于伊朗的巨大石油利益，是向来眼红的。很久以来，美国的石油垄断企业就竭力排斥英帝国主义在伊朗的势力，企图将伊朗石油完全攫为己有。早在去年七月间，以调解所谓英伊石油纠纷为名前往伊朗的杜鲁门的特使哈里曼，就曾在德黑兰公开地宣称过：“我打算了解一下开发计划以及美国推行这个计划的办法。”现在美国“国际复兴开发银行”代表急急忙忙地前往伊朗活动，就更加证实了华尔街资本家进一步掠夺伊朗石油的图谋。
    美国独占资本在英国侵略势力被伊朗人民驱逐以后所以企图乘机侵入伊朗的原因之一，是与伊朗统治集团对美帝国主义采取暧昧态度，对伊朗人民进步力量采取镇压手段有关系的。伊朗统治集团如果将伊朗人民从英国帝国主义手中夺回来的石油权益，又让美国“国际复兴开发银行”掠夺以去，则将使伊朗的主权沦于较英帝国主义势力未驱逐以前更可悲的地位。
    但是，美帝国主义掠夺伊朗石油的图谋是一定要失败的。伊朗人民早已认清了美帝国主义与英帝国主义者一样，都是他们民族的死敌。美帝国主义的加紧侵略，和伊朗统治集团出卖伊朗民族利益的行为，都只会使伊朗人民更加警惕与更加坚决地团结起来，为保卫伊朗民族的利益和实现伊朗的真正独立自主而斗争。伊朗人民反对帝国主义侵略的爱国运动，是一定会取得胜利的。
