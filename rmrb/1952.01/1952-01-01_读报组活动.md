    Reading Group Activities
    All-China Federation of Cooperatives Calls on Cooperatives at All Levels to Vigorously Promote Newspaper Reading
    Comrade cooperative cadres and members throughout the country: The movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has been launched nationwide. To powerfully advance this movement, making it a broad-based, mass movement, and thereby greatly improve the work of cooperatives, we call on cooperatives at all levels, under the leadership of local Party committees and governments, to vigorously promote newspaper reading and learning.
    The situation of corruption, waste, and dereliction of duty within the cooperative system is serious. To reverse this adverse phenomenon, a large-scale study must be launched among cadres, and newspapers are at the core of leading this study. To this end, we suggest:
    (1) The guidance sections (or departments) of cooperatives at all levels should urge staff and members of affiliated cooperatives to organize newspaper reading and learning in a guided manner, based on specific circumstances. They should be responsible for providing learning materials, organizing discussions, gathering information, and preparing summary reports.
    (2) In addition to promptly and accurately reflecting situations to the cooperative, reporting corruption and waste, and offering suggestions, reading groups should also be responsible for exposing to newspapers all criminal behaviors that violate the interests of the state and the cooperative.
    (3) Importance should be attached to newspaper reading, treating it as regular work. Because this is a powerful weapon for strengthening political learning and raising awareness.
                    All-China Federation of Cooperatives

    Editor's Note: Newspaper reading can play an active role in promoting various central tasks. It is entirely correct that the All-China Federation of Cooperatives attaches importance to this work. Other units should also attach importance to this work.

    Newspaper Reading Promotes the Movement Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy
    Editor: The movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has been launched successively nationwide. Our cooperative is an economic organization that directly faces the broad masses, and many of our staff members are new personnel and former merchants. According to the materials discovered so far, the situations of corruption and waste are serious in some cooperatives. To victoriously carry out this movement, we must first strengthen the political study of all employees and raise their ideological awareness to mobilize them to actively participate in this movement. To this end, in December of last year, our United Cooperative established a Newspaper Reading and Learning Committee, and established twenty-five reading groups based on sections, groups, and distribution points. Each group elected a reading group leader through democratic means. The work of the Newspaper Reading and Learning Committee mainly includes the following three points: (1) Unifying the arrangement of newspaper reading and learning materials; (2) Holding a joint meeting of reading group leaders once a week, where each group reports on the learning situation and raises questions; The Learning Committee provides further guidance based on the actual situation; (3) The Learning Committee assigns special personnel to each group to check the newspaper reading and learning situation and assist in solving problems encountered in learning.
    Since the planned and guided strengthening of newspaper reading and learning, although the time has not been long, it has already achieved great results. Some comrades, due to improved ideological awareness and the recognition of the harmfulness of bourgeois ideology, have begun to examine corruption and waste. Liu Chunpu, the former director of the Third Branch (currently the deputy section chief of the United Cooperative's business section), confessed that he had added water to soy sauce to profit from it, purchased cotton sweaters from the All-China Federation of Cooperatives for private merchants, and illegally accepted handling fees from merchants, etc. Wang Junzhong of the Seventeenth Distribution Point also reviewed his mistakes in giving short weight when selling goods and embezzling the extra money when settling accounts at night. Zhu Tongfu, Wang Runqiu, and Gao Zhaofu (who have been expelled) of the former Second Branch collectively embezzled and confessed voluntarily. The newspaper reading group of the United Cooperative's finance and accounting departments focused on checking the waste of accumulated funds. For example, on December 7, the total sales of the United Cooperative was over 140 million yuan, but due to the irresponsibility of the cashier, only 60 million yuan of sales were reported, resulting in 78 million yuan not being approved for the purchase of goods in a timely manner, causing great losses. There are many such situations. Many relatively responsible comrades have also criticized their serious bureaucratic styles of embezzling public funds, entertaining guests, and giving gifts, as well as ignoring corruption and waste even when they were aware of it. After this stage of study, most comrades are able to treat this movement seriously and demand to thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology ideologically.
    In order to mobilize the broad masses of members to participate in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, our Learning Committee plans to hold a representative meeting of members with emphasis, explaining the political significance of this movement and calling on the masses of members to expose and report facts of corruption and waste, so as to improve the work of the cooperative.

    读报组活动
    全国合作总社号召各级合作社大力开展读报工作
    各地合作社干部、社员同志们：反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，已经在全国范围内开展起来。为了有力地推进这一运动，使它成为广泛的、群众性的运动，从而把合作社工作大大地提高一步，我们号召各级合作社，在当地党委、政府的领导下，大力开展读报学习。
    合作社系统中的贪污、浪费、失职情况是严重的。要扭转这种恶劣的现象，必须在干部中展开一个大规模的学习，而报纸正是领导这个学习的核心。为此，我们建议：
    （一）各级合作社的组导处（或科），应督促所属合作社工作人员和社员，根据具体情况，有领导地组织读报学习，应该负责提供学习材料，组织讨论，汇集情况，作总结报告。
    （二）读报小组除应及时地正确地向合作社反映情况、检举贪污浪费，提出意见外，并应负责向报纸揭发一切违犯国家和合作社利益的罪恶行为。
    （三）应当重视读报工作，把它当作经常工作来进行。因为这是加强政治学习，提高思想的有力武器。
                    中华全国合作社联合总社
    编者按：读报工作对各种中心工作，都能起积极的推动作用。全国合作总社重视这一工作，是完全正确的。其他单位也应该重视这一工作。

    读报学习推进了反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动
    编辑同志：反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，已经在全国范围内陆续展开。我们合作社是直接面向广大群众的经济组织，而我们的工作人员中，有很多是新人员和旧商人。根据目前已发现的材料，贪污、浪费的情况在某些合作社是严重的。为了胜利地开展这个运动，就必须首先使全体职工，加强政治学习，提高他们的思想觉悟，以发动他们积极地参加这个运动。为此，在去年十二月，我们联合社成立了读报学习委员会，以科、组、分销处为单位，成立了二十五个读报小组，各组并通过民主方式，选举了读报组长。读报学习委员会的工作，主要有下面三点：（一）统一布置读报学习材料；（二）每周召开一次读报组长联席会议，由各组汇报学习情况，提出问题；学委会根据实际情况进一步给以指导；（三）由学委会抽调专人，到各组检查读报学习情况，并协助解决学习中的问题。
    自从有计划有领导地加强读报学习以来，时间虽然不久，却已收到了很大的效果。部分同志由于提高了思想觉悟，认识到资产阶级思想影响的危害性，已经开始检查贪污和浪费现象。前第三分社主任刘春圃（现任联合社业务科副科长）自动坦白说，他曾在酱油里渗水，从中取利，并替私商套购合作总社的棉毛衫，非法接受商人的手续费等。十七分销处王俊忠，也检讨了他在卖东西时少给分量，等晚上结账时，把多余的钱贪污下来的错误。前第二分社朱桐福、王润秋、高兆福（已被开除）等三人，集体贪污，也自动坦白出来。联合社财务、会计部门的读报组，着重检查了积压资金的浪费现象。如十二月七日联合社的销货总额为一亿四千多万元，由于出纳股的同志不负责任，只报销货额六千多万元，致使七千八百万元不能及时批购货物，造成很大的损失。这类情况是很多的。不少比较负责的同志，也批判了自己挪用公款、请客送礼，以及明知有贪污、浪费也不加理睬的严重的官僚主义作风。经过这一阶段的学习，大部分同志都能够严肃地对待这个运动，并要求从思想上彻底肃清资产阶级的思想影响。
    为了发动广大的社员参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，我们学委会准备有重点地召开社员代表大会，讲解这个运动的政治意义，号召社员群众揭发、检举贪污和浪费的事实，使合作社的工作提高一步。北京市第六区联合消费合作社主任    郑金龙
