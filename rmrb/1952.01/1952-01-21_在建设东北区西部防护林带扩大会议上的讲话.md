Speech at the Conference on Expanding the Western Protective Forest Belt Construction in Northeast China
(December 26, 1951)
Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government

Comrades:

This meeting is very important. It discusses an unprecedented major event in Chinese history, an event warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people.

After the liberation of Northeast China, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased, and the rural economy has risen rapidly. However, in the development of agricultural production, some obstacles have been encountered: these are floods (the Liao River flood last year was the most serious), wind and sand (the wind and sand in western Northeast China and eastern Mongolia invade the southeast every year, turning fertile land into desert), and droughts. The destruction of forests is one of the important causes of these natural disasters.

The destruction of forests is inseparable from the crimes of reactionary rule. Any reactionary ruling class, in order to profit, to build palaces, mansions, and tall buildings, has always arbitrarily felled forests without protection; especially in the heinous wars carried out by the reactionary ruling classes, the damage to forests is even greater. These reactionary rulers, except for planting some so-called "scenic trees" to decorate their palaces and recreational places, have never planned to build forests for the needs of agriculture and industry, in order to eliminate natural disasters and relieve the suffering of workers and peasants. Taking recent years as an example, as everyone knows, during the period when feudal warlords and Japanese imperialism ruled Northeast China, not only were no new forests built, but the original forests were subjected to predatory logging. This situation is just as Marx said: before socialism, there has always been the destruction of forests, and all the forestry and afforestation work done at that time was insignificant compared to this destruction. The reactionary ruling class is unwilling to build forests, just as Marx said: "The long production time (including only a relatively small labor time), and the length of the turnover period related to it, make afforestation unfavorable for capitalist enterprises." Therefore, bourgeois scientists defend their masters by saying: "Forests precede mankind, mankind brings deserts." This statement distorts the facts. The fact is: the reactionary ruling class brought deserts, brought floods, and brought disasters to mankind.

Now the regime belongs to the people. The Communist Party and the People's Government led by Chairman Mao proceed from the interests of the people and from long-term interests. We not only do not allow the destruction of forests to continue, but we must build forests on a large scale for the interests of the people, eliminate the root causes of natural disasters, and prevent them from continuing to cause harm. In the early days of liberation, it was impossible to start this work because the war and land reform were still in progress. Last year, the Northeast People's Government made the decision to "Plan and Build a Western Protective Forest Belt in Northeast China" based on the serious wind, sand, water, and drought conditions in western Northeast China. This protective forest belt, stretching from Gannan and Fuyu in Heilongjiang Province in the north to Shanhaiguan in the south, is a pioneering undertaking in China's large-scale construction of protective forest belts. Only the socialist Soviet Union has successfully built many protective forest belts. All capitalist countries cannot imagine such a great construction. As Chairman Mao said: "All facts prove that our people's democratic dictatorship system has great superiority over the political systems of capitalist countries. On the basis of this system, the Chinese people can exert their infinite power. This power cannot be defeated by any enemy." Comrades, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we can not only defeat any enemy, but also overcome the disasters of nature.

Now the plan for the construction of the protective forest belt has been formulated, preparations have been made, some areas have begun construction, and certain achievements and experiences have been created.

The construction of the protective forest belt is a great struggle to transform nature, a struggle to conquer wind and sand and eliminate floods, a struggle to seize cultivated land from nature and strive for bumper harvests, a struggle to obtain safe living conditions and healthy conditions for farmers, and also to prepare conditions for the large-scale need for timber in industry, transportation, and various construction undertakings in the future. If this construction cannot be completed, even if many other tasks are done in the western part of Northeast China and most areas of the Liao River basin, it will still be impossible to realize the hope of increasing unit yield and expanding cultivated land area. On the contrary, cultivated land will decrease year by year, output will decrease year by year, and farmers will suffer greater disasters. Therefore, the significance of building a protective forest belt is very significant and cannot be ignored in the slightest. The government and forestry departments should carefully make specific plans and preparations, conscientiously lead the people to carry out construction, and conduct strict inspections, pay attention to tree planting technology, and improve the survival rate. Communists, Youth League members, labor models, and mutual aid group members in these areas should, with their exemplary role, overcome all difficulties together with the local people and strive to complete this great task ahead of schedule.

In addition to building the western protective forest belt, we must also immediately pay attention to the protection and cultivation of the Changbai Mountain forest area. This forest area has suffered long-term unreasonable logging by the enemy, the area has been greatly reduced, and the forest area has been seriously damaged. If it is not immediately cultivated, renewed, and planted with new forests in a planned manner, the Songhua River basin will be seriously threatened by floods, and even endanger the dikes along the river. The Ministry of Forestry should lead the agricultural and forestry departments of Liaodong and Jilin provinces to immediately conduct surveys, quickly make plans, educate farmers, and prepare seedlings so that they can organize the masses to carry out afforestation next spring. At the same time, a range must be immediately delineated in the upper reaches of the Songhua River, and reclamation is strictly prohibited within this range. Other logged forest areas should also be cultivated and protected in a planned manner. In addition to this, protective forests and water conservation forests should be built in a planned manner along the banks of the Liao River, Liu River, Taizi River, Hun River, Nen River, Mudan River, Luan River, Xilamulun River, Kundu River, Yalu River, and other rivers. Trees should be planted in large quantities in a planned manner along highways, railways, and cities and villages, striving to completely green cities, villages, and roadsides within twenty years in order to change the climate, regulate rainfall, and increase income.

People's governments at all levels must pay great attention to protecting forests and preventing fires. In recent years, the losses caused by fires to the country have been serious. It is necessary to effectively establish mass fire prevention organizations, carry out fire prevention education, and make the masses realize that protecting forests is protecting the huge interests of the country and the people. For this, it is necessary to strictly prohibit burning wasteland, strictly prevent forest fires, and be highly vigilant against arson by counter-revolutionaries. Anyone who causes a forest fire is committing a crime and should be severely punished. If local people's governments do not attach importance to educating the people to protect forests, or even condone such behavior, it is a serious dereliction of duty and should be punished accordingly. Last year, a few lower-level government workers, in order to "take care" of the interests of farmers, allowed farmers to burn wasteland for cultivation, resulting in huge fires, which gave us a very serious lesson; this narrow view must be thoroughly corrected.

Comrades! We must realize that afforestation is a long-term construction work, and as long as mankind exists, afforestation work will not stop. It is not only for the present, but more importantly for the long-term interests of future generations. At present, Northeast China's forests rank first in the country, but if only logging is done without construction, after a few years, not only will disasters be invited, but also the source of timber needed for construction will be cut off. Therefore, we must immediately start large-scale forest construction. This construction is supported by the broad masses of the people. However, from a local perspective, because benefits cannot be seen immediately in the first few years, some people may take a passive attitude; in addition, the protective forest belt will occupy a part of the cultivated land, which may cause temporary dissatisfaction among the owners of these lands. Therefore, in addition to adjusting the occupied land, it is necessary to carry out universal education; especially for the above two types of people, it is necessary to patiently persuade and educate them; to enable all cadres and people to realize the great significance of this transformation of nature, and to consciously and actively act in order to victoriously complete this great construction project.

    在建设东北区西部防护林带扩大会议上的讲话
    （一九五一年十二月二十六日）
    东北人民政府主席  高岗
    同志们：
    这次会议很重要，讨论了一件我国历史上空前未有的大事，一件为广大人民热烈欢迎的大事。
    东北解放后，农民的生产积极性大大提高，农村经济迅速上升。但是，在发展农业生产中遇到了一些障碍：这就是水灾（去年辽河泛滥最为严重）、风沙（东北西部与东蒙的风沙，年年向东南侵袭，把良田变成沙漠）和旱灾。而森林的被破坏则是造成这些自然灾害的重要原因之一。
    森林的被破坏是同反动统治的罪过分不开的。任何反动统治阶级为了牟利，为了建筑宫殿、王府、高楼大厦，历来都是任意砍伐森林，不加保护的；尤其在反动统治阶级所进行的罪恶战争中，对森林的损坏更大。这些反动统治者们，除了点缀他们的宫院和游乐场所，种植一些所谓“风景树”之外，从来没有为了农业和工业的需要，为了消灭自然灾害、解除工人和农民的痛苦而有计划地建设森林。以近年为例，大家都知道，在封建军阀和日本帝国主义统治东北时代，不仅没有建设任何新的森林，反而对原有的森林作了掠夺性的采伐。这种情形，就正如马克思所说：在社会主义以前，就一直是毁灭森林，当时所作的全部护林与造林工作，如果和这种破坏相比，真是微不足道的。反动统治阶级所以不愿建设森林，也正如马克思所说：“长期的生产时间（只包括比较不大的劳动时间），和与此有关的周转期的长度，使造林对于资本主义企业不利。”因之，资产阶级的科学家替他们的主子辩护说：“森林先行于人类，人类带来沙漠。”这种说法是歪曲了事实的，事实是：反动统治阶级带来了沙漠，带来了洪水，给人类带来了灾害。
    现在政权已经属于人民了。共产党和毛主席领导的人民政府是从人民利益出发的，是从长远利益出发的。我们不仅不允许破坏森林的现象再继续下去，而且一定要为着人民的利益而大规模地建设森林，消灭自然灾害的根源，不使它继续为害。解放初期，由于战争和土地改革还在进行，还不可能着手这项工作。到了去年，东北人民政府就根据东北区西部风沙、水、旱的严重状况，作了“计划与营造东北西部防护林带”的决定。这个防护林带北起黑龙江省的甘南、富裕，南到山海关，是我国大规模营造防护林带的创举。世界上只有社会主义的苏联已经成功地建设了许多防护林带，一切资本主义国家都不可能想像会有这样伟大的建设。正如毛主席所说：“一切事实都证明：我们的人民民主专政的制度，较之资本主义国家的政治制度具有极大的优越性。在这种制度的基础上，我国人民能够发挥其无穷无尽的力量。这种力量，是任何敌人所不能战胜的。”同志们，我们在毛主席的领导之下，不仅能够战胜任何敌人，而且能够战胜自然界的灾害。
    现在建设防护林带的计划已经制定了，准备工作已经进行了，部分地区已经开始营造，并创造了一定的成绩和经验。
    防护林带的建设是改造自然的伟大斗争，是征服风沙、消灭水灾的斗争，是向自然夺取耕地、争取丰收的斗争，是为农民取得安全居住条件和健康条件的斗争，也是为着今后工业、交通和各种建设事业大量需用木材准备条件。如果不能完成这一建设，东北区西部和辽河流域大部地区即使做了其他许多工作，也还不可能实现提高单位产量和扩大耕地面积的希望。相反的，耕地将会逐年减少，产量将会逐年下降，而使农民遭到更大的灾害。因此，建设防护林带的意义是十分重大的，是丝毫不能忽视的。政府和林业部门应该细致地做好具体计划和准备工作，认真地领导人民进行建设，并进行严格的检查，注意植树技术，提高成活率。这些地区的共产党员、青年团员、劳动模范、互助组员要以自己的模范作用，和当地的人民一起，克服一切困难，争取提前完成这个伟大任务。
    除了营造西部防护林带外，还必须立即注意长白山林区的保护和抚育工作。这个林区遭受敌人长时期不合理的采伐，面积已大为缩小，林区已受严重破坏，如不即时有计划地抚育更新和营造新林，松花江流域将严重的受到水灾的威胁，甚至危及沿江的堤坝。林业部应率领辽东、吉林两省的农林厅立即进行勘察，迅速作出计划，教育农民，准备树苗，以便明春组织群众进行造林。同时必须立即在松花江上游划定一个范围，在这范围内严禁开荒。其他已经采伐的林区，也应当有计划地抚育保护。除此之外，要在辽河、柳河、太子河、浑河、嫩江、牡丹江、滦河、西喇木伦河、昆都河、鸭绿江等江河沿岸，有计划地营造护岸林和水源涵养林。在公路、铁路两旁和城市、村庄有计划地大量种树，争取在二十年内，城市、村庄和道路两旁完全绿化，以改变气候，调剂雨量，增加收入。
    各级人民政府，必须十分注意保护森林，防止火灾。几年来，火灾给国家所造成的损失是严重的。必须切实建立群众的防火组织，进行防火的教育，使群众认识保护森林就是保护国家和人民的巨大利益。为了这，必须严禁烧荒，严防林区的火灾，严重警惕反革命分子纵火。凡造成森林失火的，都是犯罪行为，应予严惩。各地人民政府如果不重视教育人民保护森林，甚至对于这种行为放任不管，就是严重的失职，同样应受到处分。去年少数下级政府工作人员，为了“照顾”农民利益，允许农民烧荒开地，以致造成巨大的火灾，给了我们十分严重的教训；这种狭隘的观点，必须彻底纠正。
    同志们！我们必须认识造林是长期的建设工作，只要人类存在，造林工作就不会停止。它不仅是为了眼前，更重要的是为着今后若干年代的长远利益。目前东北的森林，虽占全国首位，但是如果只采伐、不建设，若干年后，不仅招来灾害，而且建设所需用的木材也会断绝来源。因此，我们必须立即着手大规模的森林建设。这种建设是为广大人民所拥护的。但是从局部来说，由于在开始几年内不能立即见到利益，可能有一部分人会采取消极的态度；另外，防护林带要占去一部分耕地，可能引起这些土地的所有者一时的不满。因此，除应对占用的土地进行调剂外，必须进行普遍的教育；对于上述两种人，尤其要耐心地说服教育；要使全体干部和人民都能认识这一改造自然的伟大意义，为胜利地完成这一伟大建设工程，而自觉地积极地行动起来。
