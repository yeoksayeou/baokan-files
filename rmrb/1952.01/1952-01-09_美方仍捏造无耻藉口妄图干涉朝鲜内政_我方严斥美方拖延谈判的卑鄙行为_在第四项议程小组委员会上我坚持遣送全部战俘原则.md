　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th – On January 8th, at the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean Armistice Negotiations, the other side once again brought up the shameless rumor of our side装运 (zhuāngyùn - loading and transporting) aircraft into Korea. Using this shameless rumor as an excuse, the other side insisted on its unreasonable demand to restrict airport equipment within Korea, still attempting to realize its妄想 (wàngxiǎng - wild fantasy) of interfering in our internal affairs. The other side赖 (lài -赖皮 -赖皮 means shameless and stubborn) claimed that as long as Korea has airports, our side could violate the agreement during the armistice period and fly in planes from outside Korea at any time.

　　Our side's representative严词 (yáncí - in harsh terms) pointed out: The other side has been continuously spreading rumors for four days, to the point of denying the basis for continuing negotiations, and deeming the agreement reached with our side as fundamentally untrustworthy. If this situation does not prove that the other side is losing its argument and has to resort to this despicable method of spreading rumors to defend its indefensible unreasonable demands, then it proves that the other side is determined to delay and undermine the armistice negotiations,制造 (zhìzào - manufacture/create) excuses for continuing the war.

　　At the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item, the other side made a textual修正 (xiūzhèng - revision/correction) to its January 2nd proposal, changing "one-to-one exchange" to "equal number exchange" and "Republic of Korea" to "area south of the 38th parallel." However, it did not make any changes to the absurd and unreasonable content of its proposal.

　　Our side's representative pointed out: Releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war held by both sides after the armistice is an unavoidable obligation for both sides, and an inviolable right of all prisoners of war. Every prisoner of war was captured as a soldier of one of the warring parties. After the armistice, his release and repatriation should only be based on his military status, and any other identity or character is irrelevant. The so-called "voluntary choice of repatriation" is actually just an excuse to detain our captured personnel and hand them over to the朝中 (Cháo Zhōng - Korea and China) people's mortal enemies, which our side can absolutely not tolerate.

    美方仍捏造无耻藉口妄图干涉朝鲜内政
    我方严斥美方拖延谈判的卑鄙行为
    在第四项议程小组委员会上我坚持遣送全部战俘原则
    【新华社开城八日电】一月八日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方再度提出了我方装运飞机进入朝鲜的无耻谣言。对方以这种无耻谣言为藉口，坚持其限制朝鲜境内机场设备的无理要求，仍然企图实现其干涉我方内政的妄想。对方并无赖地声称只要朝鲜有飞机场，我方就能在停战期间破坏协议，随时自朝鲜境外飞入飞机。
    我方代表严词指出：对方四天以来连续造谣，以至不惜否定继续进行谈判的基础，并以其与我方所达成之协议为根本不可信赖。此种情况，如果不是证明对方理屈词穷，不得不采取这种卑鄙的造谣的方法，来为其所不能辩护的无理要求辩护，就是证明对方决心拖延和破坏停战谈判，为继续战争制造藉口。
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方对其一月二日方案提出文字上修正，将“一对一的交换”改作“同等数目的交换”。将所谓“大韩民国”改作“三八线以南的地区”。但对其提案的荒谬无理的内容，并没有提出任何的更动。
    我方代表指出：停战后释放并遣送双方所收容的全部战俘，是双方不可逃避的义务，也是所有战俘们不可侵犯的权利。每一战俘的所以被俘，都是作为交战一方的军人而被俘的。停战后他之应被释放与遣送，也只有根据他的军籍，任何其他身份与性格都是不相干的。而所谓“自愿选择遣返”，实际上只是企图扣留我方被俘人员送交朝中人民的死敌的藉口，是我方所绝对不能容忍的。
