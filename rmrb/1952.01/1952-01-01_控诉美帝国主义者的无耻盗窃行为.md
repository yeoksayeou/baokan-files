Accusation of the American Imperialists' Shameless Theft
    Yang Zhongjian Pei Wenzhong

    We have received reliable news that the precious cultural relic of our country, the specimen of the Chinese ape-man (commonly known as "Peking Man"), has been found in the American Museum of Natural History in New York! The publication of this news once again exposes the American imperialists' shameless theft and tears apart the invaders' hypocritical mask. At the same time, it educates all the people of China to more deeply and clearly recognize the despicable and deceptive behavior of imperialism.

    Since 1941, in the world's academic circles, it has been rumored that the specimen of the Chinese ape-man was "lost." Because this specimen is related to the study of the history of human development, proving Engels's "Labor Created Man" and Darwin's theory of evolution, the peace-loving and democratic people of the world have all expressed their regret. The details of the "loss" of this specimen have been published in special articles by Pei Wenzhong and Jia Lanpo (Pei's article appeared in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on December 4, 1945; Jia's article appeared in Cultural Relics Reference Materials, Volume 2, Issue 3). We, the Chinese people, are even more saddened by the loss of such a precious cultural relic and hate the corruption and neglect of cultural relics by the reactionary Kuomintang government in the past.

    After the so-called "loss," we suspected that the specimen of the Chinese ape-man was looted from Beijing by Japanese imperialism when it occupied Beijing. From various signs, we are even more convinced that after Japan's surrender in 1945, this precious specimen would inevitably be coveted and plundered by American imperialist elements. In March 1951, we published our conversation in the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, restating the details of the loss of "Peking Man" and the various signs of looting by American imperialism that we knew, and thus concluded that the specimen of "Peking Man" must be in the hands of American imperialists.

    After our conversation was published, Shapiro, the head of the Anthropology Department of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, hurriedly denied the assertion that "Peking Man" was in the United States, and helplessly argued that it might have sunk into the sea and there would never be a chance to find it again.

    From a letter from Dr. Koenitz, a paleontologist at Humboldt University in the German Democratic Republic, it is proven that when Shapiro denied that the "Peking Man" specimen was in the United States in New York, he may have been holding the specimen in his hand, lying against his conscience, and trying to deceive the people of the world. From this, it is clearly seen how so-called "scientists" in bourgeois society loyally serve the reactionaries!

    Even more despicable and shameless is Weidenreich, the honorary director of the former Cenozoic Research Laboratory. He was a German Jew who went to the United States in 1941 in order to obtain American citizenship. He used various methods to obtain the qualification to represent American capitalists and steal the right to study the Chinese ape-man. He should be responsible to all those in the world who are concerned about the research of "Peking Man." He lost all conscience and, following other imperialist elements, plotted to steal this precious specimen of the Chinese people as his own private property, which is truly despicable. He is now dead, but his name will stink for ten thousand years after his death.

    Dr. Koenitz's letter stated that the specimen of the Chinese ape-man was robbed from the Royal Museum in Tokyo, Japan, by an American soldier and brought to the United States privately. This is something that deserves special attention.

    We know that American soldiers did all kinds of evil in Tokyo. However, it is impossible to imagine that such a major incident, in which a soldier could rob a precious item from the Japanese Royal Museum, was the result of a soldier's individual theft. Only with the authorization of the American occupation authorities, or with the support of MacArthur's headquarters, could this theft be possible. There is no other possible explanation. This practice of burying one's head in the sand fully proves that the "scholars" who serve American imperialism have been painstakingly plotting to seize our country's precious Chinese ape-man specimen since before the outbreak of the Pacific War. Therefore, the American soldier's act of robbing from the Japanese Royal Museum may have been a robbery carried out by American imperialism through the U.S. military. Our conclusion is entirely based on facts.

    This fact makes us even more hate the reactionary regime of China in the past, which did not pay attention to the cultural undertakings of the Chinese people and was unwilling to support the work of excavating "Peking Man," but accepted the "investment" of American imperialism. American imperialism further used its consistent "sugar-coated poison" to deceive the Chinese people in order to achieve its goal of aggression against China. Because of the reactionary clique's "leading the wolf into the house," the crimes of American robbers stealing our Chinese cultural relics were further promoted. Not only the "Peking Man" specimen, but also many other valuable cultural relics have been robbed by American imperialism.

    The People's Government of New China attaches great importance to the continued excavation of the Chinese ape-man. Since 1949, it has allocated a considerable amount of funds every year to continue the excavation and research work in Zhoukoudian. It is believed that with the strong support of the People's Government and the strong efforts of the staff, we may have more important discoveries in the future.

    As the world's democratic and peace camp continues to grow unprecedentedly, we believe that the American working class and the peace-loving and democratic people will surely achieve the final victory. At that time, this Chinese ape-man specimen will surely be returned to the embrace of the motherland completely intact. From this lesson, the people of the whole country should strengthen their unity with the peace-loving and democratic people of the world, work together hand in hand, and wage a heroic struggle against American imperialism, which destroys human culture.

    控诉美帝国主义者的无耻盗窃行为
    杨钟健  裴文中
    我们得到确实消息，我国珍贵文物，中国猿人（俗称“北京人”）的标本，已经在美国纽约的国家自然历史博物馆中发现了！这个消息的发表，再度暴露了美国帝国主义的无耻的盗窃行为，再度撕毁了侵略者的虚伪面具。同时也教育了我们全中国的人民，更深刻地、更清楚地认识了帝国主义的卑鄙欺骗的行为。
    从一九四一年以来，中国猿人的标本，在世界上的学术界中，都传说着，是“遗失”了。由于这份标本关系了人类发展史的研究，证明了恩格斯的“劳动创造了人”和达尔文的进化学说，所以，全世界和平民主的人民，都同声惋惜。关于这份标本“遗失”的经过，已前后由裴文中、贾兰坡发表了专文（裴文见一九四五年十二月四日天津大公报；贾文见文物参考资料二卷三期。）我们中国人民更因失去了这样珍贵的文物而倍加惋惜，痛恨过去国民党反动政府的腐败和忽视文物。
    我们从所谓“遗失”之后，就猜疑中国猿人的标本，是日本帝国主义在占领北京的时候由北京劫夺去的。由种种迹象来看，我们更确信一九四五年日本投降后，这份珍贵标本，必然会被美国帝国主义分子所垂涎而加以掠夺。我们曾于一九五一年三月间，在香港大公报发表了我们的谈话，重新说明了“北京人”遗失的经过，和所知道的美帝国主义掠夺的种种迹象，因而断定“北京人”的标本一定在美帝国主义者的手中。
    我们的谈话发表之后，美国纽约国家自然历史博物馆的人类学部主任莎比罗（Sapiro）就急忙地否认了“北京人”在美国的论断，并且无可奈何地抵赖说，可能是沉在大海之中，永远再没有机会找见了。
    我们从德意志民主共和国的洪德堡大学古生物学家柯耐博士的来信中，证明当莎比罗在美国纽约否认“北京人”标本在美国时，他可能就是手中拿着这个标本，在昧着良心说谎，企图欺骗全世界人民。从这里，鲜明地看出，正是在资产阶级社会中的所谓“科学家”，他是如何忠诚地为反动派服务！
    更卑劣无耻的是前新生代研究室的名誉主任魏敦瑞。他是德国犹太人，为了要入美国国籍，于一九四一年跑到美国去。他用种种方法，谋得了代表美国资本家的资格，窃取了研究中国猿人的权利。他应当对全世界上关心“北京人”的研究的人士负责。他丧尽了天良，追随其他帝国主义分子之后，对于这个中国人民的珍贵标本，图谋劫为私有，真是卑鄙万分。他现在已经死了，但是他死后也要遗臭万年。
    柯耐博士的来信中曾说，中国猿人的标本是一个美国兵由日本东京的皇家博物院中抢夺出去，私自带到美国的。这是值得特别注意的一件事。
    我们知道，美国兵在东京无恶不作。但是，一个士兵竟能从日本皇家博物院中抢夺一件珍贵物品而去，这样重大的事件，不可能设想是出于一个士兵的个人窃盗行为。只有出于美国占领军当局的授意，或是麦克阿瑟总部所支持，这种盗窃才有可能，除此之外，不可能作别的解释。这种掩耳盗铃的做法，充分证明为美国帝国主义服务的“学者”们，苦心积虑，自太平洋战争爆发之前起，即阴谋侵占我国这个珍贵的中国猿人标本。因此美国兵从日本皇家博物院中去抢掠的举动，也许正是美帝国主义者通过美军所作的强盗的勾当。我们作此论断是完全有事实根据的。
    由这件事实，使我们更加痛恨过去中国的反动政权，不重视中国人民的文化事业，对于发掘“北京人”的工作，不肯给予支持，而接受美帝国主义的“投资”，美帝国主义更用他一贯的“有糖衣的毒药”来欺骗中国人，好达到他侵略中国的目的。由于反动派这样“引狼入室”，于是更促成了美国强盗们偷盗我们中国的文化遗物的罪行。不只“北京人”的标本，还有许多其他宝贵文物，也都被美帝国主义抢夺而去了。
    新中国的人民政府对于中国猿人的继续发掘工作非常重视，自一九四九年起，即每年拨发一笔相当巨大的经费，继续进行在周口店的发掘和研究工作。相信在人民政府的大力扶助和工作人员的坚强努力下，我们将来可能还有更重要的发见。
    由于世界民主和平阵营继续地空前的增强，我们相信，美国工人阶级和爱好和平民主的人民一定能够得到最后的胜利，这一份中国猿人的标本，那时就一定可以完整无缺地回到祖国的怀抱中来。由这一次的教训，全国的人民更应当加强与全世界和平民主的人民的团结共同努力，携手迈进，向摧残人类文化的美国帝国主义作英勇的斗争。
