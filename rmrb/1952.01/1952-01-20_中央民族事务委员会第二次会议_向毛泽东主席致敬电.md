    To the Respected Chairman Mao:
    The Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government has victoriously concluded, and we express our highest respect to you with boundless excitement.
    Over the past two years, thanks to the implementation of your great nationalities policy, unprecedented unity among all ethnic groups in China has been achieved. Under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups have become masters of the country, and their economic and cultural lives have been preliminarily improved. In the past, many minority ethnic groups who were neglected and buried during the reactionary rule have now stood up and enjoyed the rights of ethnic equality. The people of all ethnic groups live with hope and confidence in the friendly and cooperative family of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China.
    Our meeting was held on the basis of this unprecedented unity among all ethnic groups, with representatives from forty ethnic groups attending and participating. Such a meeting with the nature of a national ethnic representative conference, which has never happened in history, can only occur under your leadership.
    At the meeting, we fully expressed our wishes in our own ethnic languages, discussed issues such as ethnic regional autonomy, ethnic democratic coalition governments, safeguarding the equal rights of scattered minority ethnic groups, and the organization of ethnic affairs committees at all levels of people's governments, and adopted the draft outline for the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy. Through this meeting, we have more deeply understood the greatness of your nationalities policy, and more deeply recognized that ethnic regional autonomy is indeed the fundamental policy for solving China's ethnic issues. According to this policy, under the leadership of you, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, all minority ethnic groups in China, following the general path of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, will gradually improve their politics, economy, and culture, reach the level of New Democracy, and move towards a bright and promising socialist future. The universal implementation of this policy will further encourage the people of all ethnic groups to devote themselves to the development of their own ethnic groups and participate in the construction of the great motherland with infinite enthusiasm.
    Respected Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups under your leadership love the motherland. By participating in this meeting, we have more deeply realized the greatness and loveliness of the motherland. In order to consolidate and develop the victory of the people of all ethnic groups, and to defend our great motherland, in the future, we must work harder to implement and carry out the various policies and decrees of the Central People's Government, and we must unite more closely with the people of all ethnic groups, increase production, practice thrift, and continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. We assure you that the people of all our ethnic groups will actively assist and support our invincible People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and resolutely smash any aggressive conspiracy of imperialism.
    Respected Chairman Mao, you are the organizer and inspirer of the victory of all our ethnic groups, and we will always follow you forward.
    The Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government
