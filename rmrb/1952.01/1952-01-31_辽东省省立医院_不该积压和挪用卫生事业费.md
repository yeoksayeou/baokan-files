    Liaodong Provincial Hospital
    Should Not Hold Back and Misappropriate Public Health Funds
    To the Editor: Recently, the Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Finance, together with the Liaodong Provincial People's Government, inspected the financial situation of Liaodong Provincial Hospital and discovered serious cases of holding back and misappropriating public health funds. From the first to the third quarter of last year, the hospital received a total of 290 million yuan in public health funds from the Provincial Health Department, but by the end of August, their bank deposits still amounted to 100.32 million yuan. In addition, the hospital had 220 million yuan in accounts receivable. The above two items total more than 320 million yuan. This batch of funds held back is more than the hospital's nine-month allocation.
    Furthermore, according to the accounts for August of last year, this hospital also misappropriated 3.77 million yuan of public health funds to invest in Lihua Cotton Mill. According to the hospital director, this was to subsidize patients' living expenses. However, the director of the hospital's first ward, An, said that the hospital had not allocated any additional funds to subsidize patients. In fact, most of the profits they obtained from investing in Lihua Cotton Mill were used for staff salary subsidies, living subsidies, and other non-reimbursable expenses.
    I believe that Liaodong Provincial Hospital's practice of holding back and misappropriating funds to generate interest and engage in institutional production is a violation of financial discipline and is very inappropriate. I suggest that financial departments in all regions conduct a thorough inspection.
                                                                                                               Cao Guangguo

### 辽东省省立医院  不该积压和挪用卫生事业费

    辽东省省立医院
    不该积压和挪用卫生事业费
    编辑同志：最近东北人民政府财政部会同辽东省人民政府，检查了辽东省省立医院的财务情况，发现有严重积压和挪用卫生事业费的现象。这个医院在去年第一季到第三季度，共向省卫生厅领去卫生事业费二亿九千万元，但到八月末，他们在银行的存款还有一亿零三十二万元。此外，医院还有二亿二千万元的债权。以上两项共三亿二千多万元。这批被积压的款额比医院九个月应领的经费还多。
    另外从去年八月份的账上看，这个医院还挪用卫生事业费三百七十七万元投资到利华棉织厂。据医院院长说，这是为了补助病员的生活费用。但医院第一所安所长说，院方并没有另拨经费补助过病员。其实他们投资在利华棉织厂所得的利润，大部都用于工作人员的工资补助、生活补助和不能报销的其他开支了。
    我认为辽东省省立医院这种积压和挪用款项生利息、搞机关生产的作法，是违反财政纪律的行为，是很不应当的。建议各地财政事业部门都认真地检查一下。    曹光国
