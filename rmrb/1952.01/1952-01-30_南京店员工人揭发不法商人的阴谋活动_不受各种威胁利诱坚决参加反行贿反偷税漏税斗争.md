Nanjing store employees actively participated in the anti-bribery, anti-deception, and anti-tax evasion movement, playing a significant role. Some illegal businessmen, instead of waking up in the face of this movement, repenting, and bowing their heads in confession to the people, resorted to despicable and shameless means such as threats and inducements to obstruct store employees and construction workers from making accusations. In recent days, Nanjing store employees and construction workers have written to the Nanjing Xinhua Daily, exposing the conspiracies of illegal businessmen. According to the materials revealed by store employees and construction workers, a tea and snack shop in the Second District of Nanjing, whose owner has consistently engaged in bribery, deception, and tax evasion, has been using all means to win over store employees since the anti-bribery, anti-deception, and anti-tax evasion movement began. He told the workers, "Your lives were a bit hard in the past, and I didn't take good care of you, but we are all a family after all, and you will forgive me." He immediately took the workers to restaurants and bathhouses to ingratiate himself with them. When the workers refused to go, he further enticed them, saying, "Being a store employee for a lifetime is not promising. There is a shop on Zhujiang Road. I will give you the funds so you can go there and be your own boss!" He also said, "If you don't find your current living arrangements convenient, I will let you live in my Western-style house. As long as you help me and don't talk nonsense, I will give you whatever you want." The owner of a certain fresh fruit shop in the Central Department Store, in order to have his employees conceal his illegal activities, gave each employee a set of winter clothes and two taels of white fungus. After being discovered and exposed by the union, the boss immediately gathered the workers and said to them, "See! Am I, the boss, good, or is the union good? I give you clothes, but the union attacks you. What kind of union is that? This time, you must not fall into their trap." He attempted to sow discord between the workers and the union. Some illegal businessmen even forced store employees to write guarantees, signing and stamping that they "guaranteed" that he had not engaged in bribery, deception, or other illegal activities. When the store employees refused to stamp, he threatened, "You want to accuse me, don't you? I'm not afraid. At most, I'll be put in jail. When I close my doors, let's see what you poor kids will eat and drink! If you sign now, not only can our shop continue to open as usual, but we can also give you a raise." Some illegal businessmen even threatened workers by withholding wages. Some unscrupulous merchants, when threats and inducements failed, even used "honey traps" to seduce store employees. The owner of a fresh fruit shop, who in the past not only engaged in bribery and tax evasion but also used his own wife to seduce cadres, was afraid that the workers would accuse him this time, so he instructed his wife to seduce the store employees, inviting them to eat, watch plays, and play cards, and deceiving the store employees, saying, "Don't accuse me. Accusations are a loss of virtue. What will our family do if you accuse me?" The boss also said to one store employee, "As long as you don't accuse me, you can have anything you want. You can even have my wife."

    南京店员工人揭发不法商人的阴谋活动
    不受各种威胁利诱坚决参加反行贿反偷税漏税斗争
    南京市广大店员工人积极参加反行贿、反欺骗、反偷税漏税运动，对运动起了很大作用。部分不法商人，在这一运动前面，尚不及时觉醒，悔过自新，向人民低头认罪，竟采取威胁利诱等卑鄙无耻手段，阻挠店员、建筑工人进行检举。连日来，南京市店员、建筑工人纷纷致函南京新华日报，揭发不法商人的阴谋鬼计。根据店员、建筑工人所揭发的材料，南京市二区有一家茶食店，老板一贯有行贿、欺骗、偷税漏税等行为，反行贿、反欺骗、反偷税漏税运动开始后，即用尽心机，拉拢店员工人。他对工人说：“过去你们生活是苦一些，我照顾的不周到，但总归我们是一家人，你们会原谅我的。”于是立即请工人吃馆子、洗澡，讨好工人。工人们不肯去，他就进一步引诱工人说：“做一辈子店员，没出息，珠江路有家店面，我送给你们资金，你们到那里自己当老板去开店吧！”又说：“你们若嫌住的不方便，我把我那幢西式洋房给你们住。只要你们帮帮我的忙，不要乱说，你们要什么我给什么。”中央商场某鲜果店的老板，为了要店员替他隐瞒不法行为，就发给每个店员一套冬装，二两银耳。后来被工会发觉予以揭穿后，老板立即把工人召集起来，对工人们说：“你们看！我老板好，还是工会好？我给你们衣服，工会却打击你们。这算什么工会？这次，你们可千万不能上他们的圈套。”企图挑拨工人和工会的关系。有的不法商人甚至强迫店员工人给他写保证书，签名盖章“保证”他没有行贿、欺骗等等不法行为，店员工人不盖章，他就威胁说：“你想检举我，是不是？我不怕，顶多把我关进监狱，等我关了门，看看你们这般穷小子，吃什么，喝什么？现在你们如果签了名，不但我们的店可以照常开，还可以给你们加薪水。”有的不法商人，竟以不发工资来威胁工人。有的奸商，在威胁利诱都不成功时，就用“美人计”来勾引店员工人。有一家鲜果店的老板，过去不但行贿、偷税漏税，而且用自己的老婆来勾引干部，这次怕工人检举，又指示他的老婆勾引店员，邀请店员工人吃酒、看戏、打牌，并迷惑店员工人说：“可不要检举，检举是丧阴德的事，检举了，我们一家几口人怎么办？”老板并对一位店员工人说：“只要你不检举，要什么，有什么，我的老婆送你都可以。”　　　　　（南京新华日报）
