    Worker Zhang Yuxin of the steam engine workshop of the Northeast Wafangdian Textile Factory came up with a coal-saving method in September last year. Its greatest feature is: the amount of coal fed each time is uniform and does not smother the fire. This can reduce coal consumption and increase the heat release of the fire. Everyone used this method for trials in the boiler room supplying steam for sizing yarn. As a result, the average coal consumption for sizing each bolt of Renminshi cloth decreased from 5.6 jin to 5.2 jin. Later, the coal consumption for sizing each bolt of cloth was further reduced to 4.5 jin (the lowest being 4.3 jin). According to the total cotton cloth output planned for 1952, it can save raw coal worth more than 65 tons of grain.

    工人张玉新想出省煤办法每年可节省六十五吨粮食
    编辑同志：东北瓦房店纺织厂蒸汽车间工人张玉新，在去年九月想出了一个节省用煤的办法。它的最大特点是：每次送煤量均匀，不压火头。这样可以减少煤的消耗量，可以增加火的放热量。大家就用这种办法在供给浆纱用汽的锅炉间试验，结果，每疋人民市布的浆纱用煤量平均从五点六市斤降为五点二市斤。以后，每疋布的浆纱用煤量再降低到四点五市斤（最低降到四点三市斤）。按一九五二年计划的棉布总产量计算，可节省原煤值粮食六十五吨多。　　孙若华
