Jinan City Timber Profiteer Guo Songting and Three Others
Defrauded the State of More Than 4.9 Billion Yuan in Assets
Jinan Municipal People's Government Has Arrested Guo and Others and Brought Them to Justice

    Jinan city profiteers, Guo Songting, manager of Dasen Timber Factory, Yu Yizhang, manager of Senlin Timber Factory, Wang Guanjie, manager of Sihe Timber Factory, and Lu Huiting, manager of Yiju Timber Factory, defrauded the state of more than 4.9 billion yuan in assets. During the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement in industrial and commercial circles, they refused to confess to crimes such as bribing cadres and defrauding the state of assets. The Jinan Municipal People's Government has arrested the above four criminals and brought them to justice.
    In 1950, Guo Songting became acquainted with Wang Shounuo (who has been arrested), the director of the business department of Jinan Coal Industry Construction Material Company (hereinafter referred to as Coal Construction Company), and continuously wined and dined him, and gave gifts, in an attempt to defraud the state of assets through Wang Shounuo. In May 1951, due to transportation difficulties, timber was not easy to import, and timber prices were high. At this time, the Coal Construction Company had a large amount of timber in stock. Profiteers Guo Songting, Yu Yizhang, Lu Huiting and others colluded with each other, using Wang Shounuo's relationship to fraudulently purchase more than 100,000 *cai* of timber. Later, the Coal Construction Company transported a batch of low-quality Northeast pine wood and some log sections from the Northeast. At that time, the government decided that timber should not be sold externally, but profiteer Guo Songting and others bribed Wang Shounuo, who privately approved more than 6,000 *cai* (actually pulled 9,000 *cai*) to Dasen Timber Factory and more than 2,000 *cai* to Yiju Timber Factory. The price of each *cai* of these log sections was 250 yuan lower than the original price. From November 1950 to May 1951, Dasen, Senlin, Sihe, Yiju and other timber factories purchased a total of 444,388 *cai* of timber from the Coal Construction Company. After they fraudulently obtained a large amount of state assets, they used methods such as creating false accounts to engage in speculation and profiteering. The timber they bought from the Coal Construction Company was priced at an average of 3,500 yuan per *cai*, and they sold it at an average of 12,000 yuan per *cai*. Calculated at a profit of 8,500 yuan per *cai*, the total profit was more than 3.77 billion yuan. At the same time, when they bought timber, they used small heads and faces [smaller dimensions to minimize volume measurement], but when they sold timber, they measured from the middle, with a difference of 15% per *cai*, which could also yield a profit of more than 810 million yuan. The two together could yield a profit of more than 4.58 billion yuan. In 1950, Dasen Timber Factory sold more than 32,500 *cai* of miscellaneous timber to Jinan Industrial Company. At that time, the market price was 5,500 yuan per *cai*. Profiteer Guo Songting bribed Chi Zhenlin, an employee of the company, with 1.6 million yuan, and negotiated a price of 7,200 yuan per *cai*. This item alone made a profit of more than 105 million yuan. When Yu Yizhang, manager of Senlin Timber Factory, and Lu Huiting, manager of Yiju Timber Factory, contracted for the timber for the construction of the "August 1st" Auditorium of the Shandong Military Region, they bribed Hao Yunshan of the Construction Committee of the Shandong Military Region, fraudulently purchased more than 100,000 *cai* of timber, and made a profit of more than 220 million yuan. Wang Guanjie, manager of Sihe Timber Factory, used to repeatedly bribe cadres by bringing prostitutes. According to Wang's confession, he bribed more than 40 cadres. The criminal also conspired with profiteer Guo Songting and others to collude with each other to steal timber from the Coal Construction Company and obtain huge profits.

    济南市木材奸商郭松亭等四犯
    诈骗国家资财四十九亿多元
    济南市人民政府已把郭犯等逮捕法办
    济南市奸商大森木厂经理郭松亭、森林木厂经理于亦璋、四合木厂经理王冠杰、义聚木厂经理芦惠亭等四犯，诈骗国家资财四十九亿多元。他们在工商界反行贿、反偷税漏税运动中，拒不坦白贿赂干部、诈骗国家资财等罪行。济南市人民政府已将上述四犯逮捕法办。
    郭松亭在一九五○年，结识了济南市煤业建筑器材公司（以下简称煤建公司）经营处主任王守诺（已被逮捕）后，即不断请客、送礼，企图通过王守诺骗取国家资财。一九五一年五月间，因运输困难，木材不易进口，木价高贵。此时煤建公司存有大批木材。奸商郭松亭、于亦璋、芦惠亭等相互勾结，利用王守诺的关系，骗买木材十余万材。后来煤建公司又从东北运来一批质量低劣的东北松木和一部分段木。当时政府决定木材不准外卖，而奸商郭松亭等又贿赂王守诺，由王守诺私自批给大森木厂六千余材（实际拉去九千材），义聚木厂二千余材。这批段木每材较原价还低二百五十元。大森、森林、四合、义聚等木厂自一九五○年十一月至一九五一年五月，共从煤建公司买出木材四十四万四千三百八十八材。他们骗取了大批国家资财后，又利用造假账等办法，进行投机倒把。他们从煤建公司买的木材，平均每材牌价三千五百元，他们出卖时，平均每材一万二千元。按每材获利八千五百元计算，共获暴利三十七亿七千余万元。同时他们买木材时是小头小面，出卖木材时，则是从中间量，每材差百分之十五，亦可获暴利八亿一千余万元，两者共可获取暴利四十五亿八千余万元。一九五○年大森木厂卖给济南市实业公司杂木三万二千五百余材，当时市价是五千五百元一材。奸商郭松亭以一百六十万元贿赂了该公司职员迟振林，议订价格为七千二百元一材，仅此一项，获取暴利即达一亿零五百余万元。奸商森林木厂经理于亦璋、义聚木厂经理芦惠亭在承包山东军区建筑“八一”大礼堂的木材时，贿赂山东军区建筑委员会郝云山，骗买木材十余万材，获取暴利二亿二千多万元。四合木厂经理王冠杰曾经带着妓女，一次再一次地收买干部。据王犯供认，他所贿赂的干部有四十余名。该犯并主谋与奸商郭松亭等相互勾结，盗买煤建公司木材，大量地获取暴利。
