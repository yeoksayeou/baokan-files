    Commemoration of the Second Anniversary of the Diplomatic Victory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Zhou Liang, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

    Today, the entire people of Vietnam are celebrating this glorious day with boundless joy and excitement.

    Two years ago, on January 14, 1950, President Ho Chi Minh of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a message to the governments of all countries in the world. First, he described the impact of the victory of the August Revolution in Vietnam and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and accused the French colonialists of their crimes of aggression on Vietnamese territory. Then, President Ho Chi Minh emphasized: "The people and army of Vietnam are engaged in a heroic battle against the French colonialists to defend the independence of their motherland and are increasingly approaching final victory. After years of resistance, Vietnam has gained the sympathy and support of the people of the world. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam hereby declares to all governments of the world that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the sole legal government of all the people of Vietnam. For the common interests of the people, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is prepared to establish diplomatic relations with any government willing to cooperate with it on the basis of equality and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, in order to jointly defend world peace and democracy."

    On January 18, 1950, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, sent a note to Hoang Minh Giam, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, stating: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China considers the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to be the legal government representing the will of the Vietnamese people.  The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is willing to establish diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to consolidate the friendship between the two countries and strengthen their friendship and cooperation."

    A month later, the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries such as Korea, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Albania, and the German Democratic Republic successively established formal diplomatic relations with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese people cherish and value this day very much, considering it a glorious page in Vietnamese history. Therefore, on this day every year, the Vietnamese people celebrate grandly to commemorate the establishment of brotherly relations with the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries. Indeed, under the correct leadership of President Ho and the vanguard party of the working class, the Vietnamese people have always been a member of the world's family of peace and democracy, always standing at the forefront of the struggle against aggression. However, the official recognition by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has made the people of all strata of the country more clearly realize that the struggle to safeguard world peace and democracy is closely related to the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence, freedom, prosperity, and happiness, thereby understanding the importance of the historical task they bear and seeing the beautiful and bright future, which has increased their boundless courage and conviction.

    The diplomatic achievements of the Vietnamese people are not accidental; they are the result of the arduous struggle of the Vietnamese people for more than twenty years under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and the correct leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the vanguard party of the working class. As early as 1946, the Vietnamese people implemented universal suffrage, established a democratic National Assembly, promulgated a constitution, and established a national army. The Vietnamese people have sufficient conditions to become an independent people's democratic dictatorship state and will never tolerate any imperialist infringing upon or undermining Vietnamese territory and sovereignty. The Vietnamese people are unswervingly united around President Ho Chi Minh and the vanguard party of the working class, heroically giving the aggressors a merciless blow.

    The victory of the Vietnamese national liberation struggle and the ability to defeat the enemy today are closely related to the great and heroic Soviet Red Army's defeat of millions of Japanese Kwantung Army troops and the great and heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army's liberation of the entire Chinese mainland. Because of the brilliant victories of the Soviet Union and China, the August Revolution in Vietnam smoothly achieved victory, and the ferocious enemy standing on the Vietnamese border—the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the running dogs raised by the American imperialists—was struck out of the mainland by the huge iron fist of the Chinese people, allowing the Vietnamese people to concentrate on fighting the French and American imperialist aggressors without worries about the rear. This has created favorable conditions for the friendship between the Vietnamese people and the people of various brotherly countries to develop towards cooperation and friendship, and for the relations between the countries to become increasingly consolidated.

    The diplomatic victory of the Vietnamese people marks the continuous unity, growth, and strengthening of the democratic camp. Conversely, this victory has caused the French and American imperialists to panic. Because the imperialist bloc's fantasy of supporting the Bao Dai puppet regime to cover up their aggression against Vietnam and their attempt to deceive the people of the world has completely failed (as evidenced by the recent shameless request by France and the United States to the United Nations to allow the Bao Dai puppet regime to join the United Nations as a member), while the international status of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been unprecedentedly elevated, which has caused the French and American imperialist bloc to suffer insurmountable contradictions and difficulties under the condemnation of the people and progressive public opinion throughout the world and under the continuous blows of the Vietnamese people's victories. Therefore, the imperialists are hostile to our victory. This is one aspect.

    On the other hand, this victory has greatly enhanced and encouraged the Vietnamese people's firm confidence in the certain victory of the resistance war, and has also greatly inspired the confidence of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries around the world in winning the victory of the national liberation struggle, especially the national liberation struggles in Southeast Asia, and especially the liberation movements of the Khmer (Cambodian) and Lao peoples on the Indochinese Peninsula, playing a very great role in promoting them.

    Facts have proved that in the past two years, the Vietnamese people have bravely won a series of victories in the anti-aggression struggle. In the military field, the Vietnamese People's Army has achieved major victories in the five major campaigns. In the political field, the domestic national united front has been unprecedentedly expanded and consolidated, the united front of the three peoples on the Indochinese Peninsula has been established, and the Vietnam Workers' Party has been established. In the economic and cultural aspects, many achievements have also been made. It must be emphasized here that in the past two years, the Vietnamese people have attached great importance to the work of enhancing the friendship of various brotherly countries. Branches of the "Vietnam-China Friendship Association" and the "Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association" have been established in various parts of the country. The Vietnamese people have sent more delegations than before to visit the two brotherly countries of China and Korea, and have also sent many delegations to participate in various international activities. The Vietnamese people have expressed warm support for the world peace movement. Although transportation is difficult during wartime, as of now, 7.5 million people have signed their names demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. The Vietnamese people are willing to work harder in the future to strengthen their friendship with various brotherly countries and better learn from the advanced experiences of various brotherly countries, especially the rich combat and construction experiences of the Chinese people, to overcome the difficulties caused by the increasingly frantic French and American imperialists in Vietnam before their death, and to fight to the end for the greater victory of the national liberation and the struggle to defend world peace and democracy.

    We firmly believe that as long as we unite closely with the people of the world and deeply understand President Ho Chi Minh's instruction: "Our resistance war is long and arduous, but it will surely be victorious," we have full confidence and determination to completely defeat the French colonialists and American imperialist interventionists.

    越南民主共和国外交胜利纪念日两周年纪念
    越南民主共和国代表团临时代办  周亮
    越南全国人民今天正以无限欢愉和兴奋的热情来庆祝这个光荣的日子。
    两年前，一九五○年一月十四日越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席向世界各国政府公布一篇文告。首先，他叙述越南八月革命胜利的影响和越南民主共和国成立的经过，并控诉法殖民主义者在越南领土上的侵略罪行。接着胡志明主席着重说道：“越南的人民与军队为了保卫祖国的独立，正对法国殖民者进行着英勇的战斗，并日益接近获得最后胜利。经过数年抗战，越南已得到了世界人民的同情和拥护。越南民主共和国政府谨向全世界各国政府宣布：越南民主共和国政府是越南全体人民唯一的合法政府。为了人民的普遍利益，越南民主共和国政府准备与任何愿在平等和互相尊重国家主权及领土的基础上与之合作的政府建立外交关系，以谋共同保卫世界的和平与民主。”
    一九五零年一月十八日中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来送给越南民主共和国外交部部长黄明鉴一件照会谓：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为越南民主共和国政府是代表越南人民意志的合法政府，中华人民共和国中央人民政府愿意和越南民主共和国政府建立外交关系并互派大使，借以巩固两国邦交，加强两国的友好和合作。”
    一个月之后，苏联和各人民民主国家如朝鲜、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、波兰、阿尔巴尼亚以及德意志民主共和国等，相继与越南民主共和国政府建立正式外交关系。越南人民非常珍爱和重视这个日子，认为这是越南历史上光荣的
    一页，因而每逢此日，越南全国人民欢欣鼓舞举行盛大庆祝会来纪念与苏联、中国及各人民民主国家建立亲如兄弟的邦交。诚然，越南人民在胡主席和工人阶级先锋政党正确的领导下，向来就是世界和平民主大家庭中的一个成员，永远站在反侵略斗争的前哨，但由于以苏联为首的和平民主的社会主义阵营的正式承认，使全国各阶层人民更加明确地认识到对争取保卫世界的和平与民主是和越南人民的争取独立与自由、繁荣与幸福休戚相关的，从而明了到自己所负的历史任务的綦重，看到美丽光辉的远景，更增加了无限的勇气和信念。
    越南人民在外交上的成就并非偶然的，这是越南人民二十多年来在马列主义的指导下，在胡志明主席和工人阶级的先锋政党正确的领导下艰苦战斗的成果。越南人民早在一九四六年就实行全民总选举，成立民主的国民议会，颁布宪法，建立国家军队。越南人民已有足够的条件成为一个独立的人民民主专政的国家，绝不容忍任何一个帝国主义者侵犯和损害越南的领土和主权。越南人民始终不渝地团结在胡志明主席和工人阶级先锋政党的周围，英勇地给予侵略者以无情的痛击。
    越南民族解放斗争的胜利与今天之所以能战胜敌人，是和伟大英勇的苏联红军击溃百万的日本关东军以及伟大英勇的中国人民解放军解放中国全部大陆有着密切联系的。由于有了苏联、中国光辉的胜利，使越南的八月革命顺利地获得胜利，使站在越疆上凶恶的敌人——蒋介石匪帮，美帝国主义者所豢养的走狗——被中国人民巨大的铁拳击出大陆，使越南人民无后顾之忧而专力去打击法、美帝国主义侵略者。这就造成越南人民和各兄弟国家的人民的友谊日趋于合作友好，邦交日臻于巩固的有利条件。
    越南人民在外交上的胜利，正标志着民主阵营力量不断地团结增长和壮大。相反地，由于这个胜利，使法、美帝国主义者慌乱失措。因为帝国主义集团幻想扶植保大傀儡政权以掩饰它们侵略越南和企图蒙骗世界人民的阴谋诡计遭到完全破产（如最近法、美勾结无耻地要求联合国让保大傀儡政权加入联合国为会员），而越南民主共和国政府在国际间的地位是空前提高起来，这使法、美帝国主义集团在全世界人民和进步舆论的谴责下，在越南人民胜利的连续打击下，正遭到了无可克服的矛盾与困难。所以帝国主义者是敌视我们这个胜利的。这是一方面。
    另一方面，由于这个胜利，大大地提高与鼓舞了越南人民对抗战一定胜利的坚强信心，也大大地激励了全世界殖民地半殖民地人民对争取民族解放斗争胜利的信心，尤其是对东南亚的民族解放斗争，特别是对印度支那半岛上的高棉（柬埔寨）和寮国（老挝）两族人民的解放运动起着极大的推动作用。
    事实证明，过去的两年，越南人民奋勇地在反侵略斗争中，赢得一连串的胜利。在军事方面，越南人民军已在五大战役中取得了重大胜利。在政治方面，国内民族统一战线空前的扩大与巩固，在印度支那半岛上三民族的人民统一战线被建立起来，越南劳动党成立了。在经济和文化其他各方面，同样获得不少成就。这里必须着重指出的是：过去两年中，越南人民对增进各兄弟国家友谊的工作极为重视，“越华友谊会”，“越苏友谊会”的分会在全国各地纷纷设立，越南人民比以前更多地派出自己的代表团访问了中朝两兄弟国家，还派出许多代表团参与国际间的各种活动。越南人民对世界和平运动表示热烈拥护，虽在战时交通困难情况下，但截至现在为止，已有七百五十万人签名要求五大国缔结和平公约。越南人民今后愿更努力地加强与各兄弟国家的友谊，更好地学习各兄弟国家的先进经验，特别是中国人民丰富的战斗与建设的经验，来克服法、美帝国主义者垂死前在越南越发疯狂而造成的困难，来为民族解放和保卫世界和平民主斗争的更大胜利而战斗到底。
    我们深信，只要我们和全世界人民紧密地团结在一起，深刻地领会到胡志明主席的指示：“我们的抗战是长期而艰苦的，但一定取得胜利。”我们有充分信心和决心完全击败法殖民主义者和美帝国主义干涉者。
