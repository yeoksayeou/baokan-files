Some private merchants in Wuhan colluded with corrupt elements in the Hengyang Railway Bureau, resulting in four bribery and embezzlement cases that caused a loss of approximately 2.4 billion yuan in national property. The occurrence of these cases exposed the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres in the Materials Department of the Hengyang Railway Bureau and the Wuchang Materials Factory. In some cases, it also showed that the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce did not correctly implement the policy on industry and commerce, lost its position, and actually shielded illegal private merchants. The details of these cases are as follows:

I. Babbitt Alloy Case

The Hengyang Railway Bureau purchased a total of 16 tons of No. 1 and No. 3 babbitt alloy used in locomotives from Hankou Shunfeng Hardware Store, Chongxin Hardware Store, and Dachang Copper and Lead Store in August and October 1950. The responsible persons of these three commercial firms colluded with 32 businesses in the same trade, agreeing to collectively raise bids. The three firms that won the bid would then distribute a percentage (10% or more) of the transaction price equally among themselves. These 32 capitalists and 38 staff and workers who participated in the matter shared a total of 157.3 million yuan in illicit gains. At the same time, Sun Baosheng, the material inspector, and Wang Huian, the receiving clerk of the Hengyang Railway Bureau, were bribed, receiving a total of 6.1 million yuan. The babbitt alloy delivered was mixed with sheet tin, furnace tin, and other impurities. Based on the market prices at the time, the loss to national property was more than 680 million yuan. The losses to the nation due to the substandard quality of the goods were incalculable. This case was exposed when a peddler, Liu Ziqiang, overheard an argument over the uneven distribution of the illicit gains and wrote a letter to the Changjiang Daily. During the interrogation, these unscrupulous merchants denied everything. Because Jin Zuohua, the director of the hardware industry union who was bribed to participate in the fraud, and others voluntarily surrendered themselves, the details of the case were thoroughly clarified early on. The Wuhan Municipal People's Procuratorate has concluded the investigation of the criminal facts in this case, and the Wuhan Municipal People's Court has made a judgment, which is currently being reviewed by the Wuhan Municipal People's Government.

II. Hardware Case

During the trial of the babbitt alloy case, the main culprits, Hu Xinxiang and Zhong Jiaxing, confessed that there were crimes such as bid-rigging, bribery, and embezzlement in the hardware industry and other industries. As a result of this revelation, Jin Zuohua and others handed over an account book of bid-rigging and embezzlement. At the same time, the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions called on shop employees and workers to confess and report. Under these circumstances, 17 capitalists and 22 laborers organized a "Committee for Cleaning Up Accumulated Malpractices" on February 26, 1951. Despite the active reporting and exposure by shop employees, some unscrupulous merchants still tried to deny it. After a fierce struggle, a handling conference was held on March 28 last year (with representatives from the Municipal People's Court and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions participating). A total of 42 unscrupulous merchants (including three that had ceased operations) and 91 shop employees participated in this fraud. A total of more than 191.126 million yuan in illicit gains was found. In addition to the Hengyang Railway Bureau, the injured units included the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, the Central China Iron and Steel Company, and the Central South Industrial Department, among 13 units.

III. Electrical Materials Case

In the hardware case, Zheng Yunmiao, a shop employee of Ruichang Hardware Company, confessed that he had received a share of the illicit gains from bid-rigging in the electrical materials industry. Therefore, the Materials Department of the Hengyang Railway Bureau organized five capitalists and five laborers from the hardware industry to encourage unscrupulous merchants in the electrical materials industry to confess. On March 20 last year, the "Committee for Cleaning Up Accumulated Malpractices in the Electrical Materials Industry" was established. After more than 40 days of mobilization and confession, it was found that 12 companies had engaged in bid-rigging, causing a loss of more than 322.45 million yuan to the Hengyang Railway Bureau, and losses of more than 36 million yuan and 1,000 workdays to eight units, including the Army Hospital, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, the Central South Industrial Department, and the Central China Iron and Steel Company.

IV. Paint Case

In 1950, the Hengyang Railway Bureau continuously ordered paint from Jianhua and Jiancheng Paint Factories in Wuhan City through comparative pricing. The orders from Jianhua totaled 5.3 billion yuan, and the orders from Jiancheng totaled 4.5 billion yuan. The Hengyang Railway Bureau suspected that they were raising prices collectively because the two factories repeatedly quoted the same prices. In July of the same year, an account audit revealed that the two factories did indeed engage in collective bid-rigging (these were the only two paint manufacturing plants in Wuhan City). After mobilizing employees involved in the purchase of paint to confess, Liu Yongxing, a sample inspector at the vehicle factory, and Wang Jincheng, a material manager, admitted that they had accepted bribes (a total of 14.55 million yuan in bribes from Jianhua Paint Factory and 7.05 million yuan in bribes from Jiancheng Paint Factory). Workers at Jianhua Paint Factory reported that the factory had made false accounts. Based on this situation, the Hengyang Railway Bureau conducted an investigation of the two factories and, on March 4 last year, went to Jianhua Factory to audit the accounts together with the Fourth Branch of the Wuhan Municipal Tax Bureau. The false accounts had been destroyed during the audit, but it was found that the cost had been falsely increased (deliberately calculating the cost higher in order to evade taxes. The tax payments of over 268 million yuan were paid after it was discovered). An inspection of the black blending paint that the factory had tested revealed that the unit cost formula of the experiment at the factory was very different from the unit cost formula that it reported to the Hengyang Railway Bureau, indicating that the solid portion of the listed raw materials was 11.5 percentage points higher, and the liquid portion was 11.5 percentage points lower. Calculated in this way, the reported cost was 23.6 percentage points higher. Tang Xingchu, the manager of Jianhua Factory, admitted that the cost sheet was inconsistent with the ingredient sheet, with irrefutable evidence of using inferior goods, and confessed in writing that the illegal profit was about 800 million yuan, and he was willing to repay it in installments with paint. Liu Kaijun, the manager of Jiancheng Factory, initially firmly denied any bribery, but after repeated interrogation by the public security organs, he confessed to earning illegal profits of 300 to 400 million yuan and all bribery facts. On March 28 and 29, the First Branch of the Wuhan Municipal Tax Bureau went to Jiancheng Factory to audit the accounts, and also found that the cost had been falsely increased, and ordered the factory to pay more than 192.59 million yuan in tax payments.

In the above four cases, unscrupulous merchants took advantage of the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of public enterprises, the embezzlement and bribery of corrupt elements, and the imperfect inspection system, causing huge losses to the country. About 30 bribe-takers at the Hengyang Railway Bureau received a total of more than 100 million yuan in bribes. These four cases caused a loss of more than 2.4 billion yuan in national property due to the price difference between inferior products and genuine products, and the inferior products were not suitable for use, or could only be used reluctantly, but affected safety, affected other parts, and affected the service life. The losses cannot be calculated. The investigation of the paint case has not yet ended, and the crimes have not been thoroughly understood; however, the evidence of buying off public officials and colluding with each other to pass off inferior goods as genuine goods is conclusive.

These cases exposed the serious bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the Materials Department of the Hengyang Railway Bureau and the Wuchang Materials Factory. Before April 1950, comrades below had reported that the purchased paint was not good, and there were reports again in July, but they did not arouse the attention and vigilance that leading cadres should have. They only added a guarantee to a batch of paint ordered on April 20. In July of the same year, it was discovered that Jianhua and Jiancheng were collectively raising bids, but no in-depth inspection or analysis was conducted. The person in charge of the Materials Section of the Wuchang Branch (now merged into the Materials Factory) rarely looked at the goods sent by merchants. Only the inspector stamped the inspection form, and the engineer and the chief of the responsible section did not check it; furthermore, a good inspection system was not established. The ingredient sheets of the paint sent by Jianhua and Jiancheng before and after, the same paint from the same factory, had some different ingredients, but the Materials Factory had not noticed it; the ingredient sheets received before and after had not been checked.

In the past, some cadres unilaterally emphasized supporting and developing private industry and commerce, and did not fight against speculative bribery by private industry and commerce. The babbitt alloy case was delayed for a long time without being handled. The handling of the hardware case and the electrical materials case by the Materials Department of the Hengyang Railway Bureau, the Wuchang Materials Factory, and the Wuchang Branch of the Wuhan Municipal People's Court also had shortcomings. They only mobilized confessions, without distinguishing between serious and minor cases, and refunded the money according to the book loss. No punishment was given to unscrupulous merchants with serious circumstances, and they were overly lenient. They did not distinguish between those unscrupulous merchants who demanded repentance and those who vehemently denied and were forced to confess or did not confess thoroughly; they also did not distinguish between the main criminals among the unscrupulous merchants and the employees of private enterprises who participated in the fraud (in fact, the cases were mainly resolved due to the active confessions of the employees); no rewards were given to the original whistleblowers; Jin Zuohua, the director of the hardware industry union who had participated in the fraud and confessed after the incident, was to be given a 10% bonus (to be borne by the government); it was even planned to publish a commendation in the newspaper for unscrupulous merchants who confessed and refunded the money. These are all incorrect.

The attitude of the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce in handling the paint case also showed an unstable position. Wen Xiang, the deputy director of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce (director of the processing and ordering committee), believed that this case was only a "contract dispute" and should not be treated as a case of loss of national property, so he believed that it should be mediated by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce; and he also believed that the arrest and investigation conducted by the Public Security Department of the Hengyang Railway Bureau were illegal. He said: "Now it is a united front of four classes. Regardless of public or private, since it is a trading relationship, it is a contract dispute; the Bureau of Industry and Commerce is the competent authority, and it should treat everyone 'fairly'." He also believed that the government had not defined the line between illegal profits and legal profits, so the method of refunding the money was incorrect and should only be subject to a fine of 5% to 10%. After the People's Supervision Committee of the Central South Military and Political Committee ascertained the facts, it convened a meeting of responsible persons from relevant departments. At that time, Comrade Wen Xiang still insisted on his erroneous view, and said that the Central South People's Supervision Committee's approach was "organizing small cliques to rectify private capitalists." Afterwards, Wen Xiang reported to the Central South Military and Political Committee, insisting on his original view and accusing the Central South People's Supervision Committee of making mistakes. Finally, the Central South Military and Political Committee convened relevant departments to discuss and approved the handling opinions of the People's Supervision Committee.

The handling opinions of the People's Supervision Committee of the Central South Military and Political Committee were: it is recommended that the court promptly handle the unscrupulous merchants Tang Xingchu and Liu Kaijun according to law; it is recommended that the Wuchang Branch promptly handle the babbitt alloy case (which has now been judged); there are some shortcomings in the handling of the hardware case and the electrical materials case, and it is recommended that the Central South Branch conduct a retrial; the corrupt and bribe-taking personnel of the Hengyang Railway Bureau should be dealt with quickly, and those who confess voluntarily may be given a lighter punishment; it is recommended that the Hengyang Railway Bureau order the responsible persons of the Materials Department and the Wuchang Materials Factory to conduct a review and formulate specific measures to improve their work; it is recommended that the Wuhan Municipal People's Government order the responsible persons of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to conduct a review and inspect the work of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce in order to correct policies and educate cadres; Liu Ziqiang, Xu Fubi, Xia Yuanwen, and others who reported the babbitt alloy case should be commended and given material rewards.

    武汉某些私商勾结衡阳铁路局贪污分子
    先后发生四起行贿贪污案件
    侵蚀国家财产约二十四亿元
    武汉市一些私商勾结衡阳铁路管理局的贪污分子，先后发生行贿贪污案件四起，使国家财产损失约二十四亿元。这些案件的发生，暴露了衡阳铁路局材料处和武昌材料厂领导干部的官僚主义作风，其中有的案件，还表现了武汉市工商局没有正确地执行工商业政策，丧失立场，实际上袒护了不法私商。这些案件的经过如下：
    一、白合金案
    衡阳铁路局在一九五○年八月和十月两次向汉口顺丰五金号、崇信五金号及大昌铜铅号购买机车使用的一号三号白合金共十六吨。这三家商号的负责人，勾结三十二家同业，约好集体抬标，由这三家得标者按成交价格提一成及一成以上均分。这三十二家资方及参加这件事的职员、工人三十八人，共分得赃款一亿五千七百三十万元。同时被收买的衡阳路局鉴料人孙宝生及收料人汪惠安，前后受贿共六千一百万元。所交白合金掺入平面锡、炉锡及其他杂质，照当时物价推算，国家财产损失六亿八千多万元。至于因货品不合规格而使国家受到的损失，更无法计算。这个案子因内部分赃不匀发生争吵，被过路小贩刘自强听见，写信给长江日报揭发出来。在审讯期间，这些奸商百般抵赖。由于被奸商收买参加舞弊的五金业工会主任金作华等自动投案，案情得以提早彻底查明。本案犯罪事实，已经武汉市人民检察署侦讯终结，并经武汉市人民法院判决，正由武汉市人民政府核定中。
    二、五金案
    白合金案主犯胡新祥、钟家兴在受审时供出，五金业及其他行业都有抬标行贿分赃等罪行。经这一揭发，金作华等又交出一本抬标分赃的账簿。同时，武汉市总工会号召店员、工人坦白、检举。在这种情况下，资方十七人、劳方二十二人在一九五一年二月二十六日组织了“清理积弊委员会”。在店员积极检举揭发下，某些奸商仍然想抵赖。经过剧烈斗争，在去年三月二十八日召开了处理大会
    （有市人民法院及市总工会代表参加）。参加这次舞弊的奸商共四十二家（内三家已停业），店员九十一人，清查出赃款共一亿九千一百二十六万多元。受损失的机关，除衡阳路局外，还有郑州路局、华中钢铁公司、中南工业部等十三个单位。
    三、电料案
    在五金案中，瑞昌五金公司店员郑云庙坦白了自己分过电料业抬标赃款的事实。于是，衡阳铁路局材料处组织五金业资方劳方各五人，推动电料业奸商坦白。去年三月二十日成立了“电料业清理积弊委员会”。经过四十多天的动员、坦白，结果查出抬标者十二家，使衡阳路局损失三亿二千二百四十五万余元，使陆军医院、郑州路局、中南工业部、华中钢铁公司等八个单位损失三千六百余万元及一千工薪分。
    四、油漆案
    一九五○年衡阳铁路局向武汉市建华、建成两油漆厂以比价比货的方式，连续定购油漆，在建华定货共价五十三亿元，在建成定货共价四十五亿元。衡阳铁路局以这两个厂屡次报价相同，就怀疑它们有抬价行为。同年七月查账结果，发现这两个厂确有集体抬标的事实（武汉市油漆制造厂只有这两家）。经动员和购买油漆有关的职工坦白，车辆厂看样工人刘永兴、管料人王经成都承认曾接受过贿赂（共计建华油漆厂行贿一千四百五十五万元，建成油漆厂行贿七百零五万元）。建华油漆厂工人反映，这个厂造有假账。根据这一情况，衡阳铁路局向两厂进行调查，并在去年三月四日会同武汉市税局四分局前往建华厂查账。查时假账已被销毁，但查出了成本虚伪增值（故意把成本算得高些，这是为了漏税。被查出后税款已补缴二亿六千八百多万元）。检查这个厂试制的黑调合漆，发现这个厂实验的单位成本配料表，和它报给衡阳路局的单位成本配料表大不相同，表示所列原料固体部分多百分之十一点五，液体部分少百分之十一点五。照这样计算起来，所报成本高出百分之二十三点六。建华厂经理唐性初，以冒用劣质货证据确凿，承认成本单与成份单不符，书面坦白出非法利润约八亿元，愿以油漆分期抵还。建成厂经理刘开峻起初坚不承认有行贿情事，经公安机关再三讯问，才坦白出赚了非法利润三、四亿元及全部行贿事实。三月二十八日、二十九日武汉市税务局一分局到建成厂查账，也查出了成本虚伪增值，已令这个厂补缴税款一亿九千二百五十九万多元。
    在以上四案中，奸商利用公营企业领导干部的官僚主义作风、贪污分子的贪赃受贿以及验收制度的不健全，使国家蒙受巨大损失。衡阳铁路局的受贿者约三十人，受贿总数在一亿元以上。这四起案件，在劣品与真品价格差额上共使国家财产损失约二十四亿元以上，而劣品不合使用，或虽可勉强使用，但影响安全，影响其他机件及使用年限，损失还没法计算。油漆案因侦察还没有结束，罪行还没有彻底了解；但收买公务人员，互相勾结以劣质货品冒充真品，证据都是确凿的。
    这些案件暴露了衡阳铁路局材料处及武昌材料厂领导干部的严重的官僚主义作风。一九五○年四月以前，下面同志已反映所购油漆不好，七月又有反映，都没有引起领导干部应有的注意和警惕；他们只是就四月二十日所定的一批油漆加立了一张保证书。同年七月间已发现建华、建成集体抬标，也没有去深入检查和研究分析。武昌分局材料科（现合并为材料厂）负责人对商人送来的货物，很少看过。验货单上仅验收员盖了章，工程师和主管科长都未检查；更没有很好地建立检验制度。建华、建成前后送去的油漆成份单，同厂同样的油漆却有些成份不同，材料厂一直没有发现；前后所接到的成份单也没有核对过。
    过去某些干部对私营工商业片面地强调扶助和发展对私营工商业投机行贿行为没有进行斗争。白合金案曾被拖延了很久没有处理。对于五金案和电料案，衡阳铁路局材料处、武昌材料厂、及武汉市人民法院武昌分庭的处理也是有缺点的，只是动员坦白，不分轻重，按账面损失退款了事，对情节严重的不法商人未予处分，过分宽大。他们对于奸商中的要求悔过自新的和极力抵赖被迫坦白的或坦白不彻底的没有加以区别；对主谋犯罪的不法奸商和参与舞弊的私营企业职工也没有加以区别（事实上主要是由于职工的积极坦白，案件才得以解决）；对原揭发人没有给以奖励；对曾经参加舞弊、在案发后坦白的五金业工会主任金作华等却要给一成奖金（由政府负担）；对坦白退款的奸商竟拟登报表扬。这些都是不对的。
    武汉市工商局对油漆案的处理态度，也表现了立场不稳。市工商局副局长文祥（加工订货委员会主任）认为这个案子只是“合同纠纷”，不应作为损失国家财产案处理，因此认为应由工商局调解；并且他对于衡阳铁路局公安处进行逮捕、侦察，也认为是非法的。他说：“现在是四个阶级的统一战线，不管公营私营，既然是买卖关系，就是合同纠纷；工商局是主管机关，一律‘公平’对待。”他又认为政府并没有规定非法利润和合法利润的界线，因此退款办法是不正确的，而只应科以百分之五到百分之十的罚款。当中南军政委员会人民监察委员会查明事实后，就召集有关部门负责人举行会议。那时，文祥同志仍坚持他的错误观点，并且说中南人民监察委员会的作法是“组织小宗派，整私人资本家”。事后文祥并向中南军政委员会呈报，坚持原来观点，并且指责中南人民监察委员会错误。最后中南军政委员会召集有关部门讨论，批准了人民监察委员会的处理意见。
    中南人民监察委员会的处理意见是：建议法院依法迅速处理奸商唐性初、刘开峻；建议武昌分庭迅速处理白合金案（现已判决）；五金案电料案处理上有若干缺点，建议中南分院进行复审；对衡阳铁路局贪污受贿人员应赶快处理，对自行坦白的可减轻处分；建议衡阳铁路局责令材料处及武昌材料厂负责人进行检讨，拟定具体改进工作办法；建议武汉市人民政府责令工商局负责人作检讨，并检查工商局的工作，以端正政策并教育干部；对白合金案揭发人刘自强、徐傅必、夏元文等应予以表扬，并给以物质奖励。
