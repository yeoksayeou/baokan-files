Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: According to TASS, the people of Moscow are preparing to celebrate the New Year. 150,000 fir trees transported from the suburbs are being sold in various districts of the city, as Moscow residents like to decorate their homes and clubs with fir trees at the end of the year. All department stores and various shops have been particularly crowded recently. On the eve of the New Year holiday - December 29th - the New Year trees in Moscow schools were brightly lit. The children of the capital will hold many New Year carnivals. All cultural palaces, clubs and concert halls have arranged dances and artistic performances for them. As in previous years, the Column Hall of the House of Trade Unions will become a gathering place for children, where more than 100,000 children will be entertained during the New Year holiday. Moscow theaters have prepared wonderful programs for children.

On the eve of the New Year, industrial enterprises in Moscow City and the Moscow Region have successfully completed their 1951 production plans. Leading factories include the "Hammer and Sickle" Steel Plant, the Dynamo Factory, and the Kolomna Locomotive Manufacturing Plant. The working people of Moscow have gloriously fulfilled the production guarantees they made to the great Stalin. They have greatly increased the output of the most important goods and further improved production technology. At the same time, thousands of Moscow residents have moved into beautiful new apartments. The buildings built by Moscow construction workers this year have a floor area of 710,000 square meters. Thanks to the tremendous development of the construction industry and the mechanization of construction work, Moscow has added new rows of buildings. Seven of the eight large buildings under construction in the city are now completed. Every night, people can see the light of the red star on the 238-meter-high central building spire of Moscow University on Lenin Hills, which is the best symbol of the victory of Moscow's peaceful construction.

    莫斯科人民准备欢度新年
    文化宫俱乐部均为儿童安排节目工业企业胜利完成去年生产计划
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社讯：莫斯科人民正准备欢度新年。从市郊运来的十五万株枞树正在市内各区出售，因为莫斯科居民喜欢在岁末用枞树来装饰家庭和俱乐部。所有的百货店和各种商店近日特别拥挤。在年假前夕——十二月二十九日，莫斯科各学校的新年树上灯光辉煌。首都的儿童们将举行许多新年游艺会。所有的文化宫、俱乐部和音乐厅都为他们安排了舞会和艺术表演。像往年一样，工会大厦圆柱大厅将成为儿童们聚会的地方，在年假期间，将有十万以上的儿童在那里娱乐。莫斯科的剧院都为儿童们准备了精彩的节目。
    在新年前夕，莫斯科市和莫斯科州的工业企业已胜利地完成了一九五一年的生产计划，名列前茅的工厂有：“锤子与镰刀”钢铁厂、狄纳莫工厂、科洛姆纳机车制造厂等。莫斯科的劳动人民已光荣地履行了他们向伟大的斯大林所提出的生产保证。他们已大大地提高了最重要物品的产量并进一步改进了生产技术。和这同时，莫斯科已有数千居民迁入美丽的新公寓。今年莫斯科建筑工人建造的房屋，地面面积为七十一万平方公尺。由于建筑工业的巨大发展和建筑工作的机械化，莫斯科又新添了成排的楼房。全市在建筑中的八座大厦目前已有七座完工。每到夜间，人们都可以看到列宁山上莫斯科大学二百三十八公尺高的中央建筑物尖塔上的红星的光芒，这是莫斯科和平建设胜利的最好的标志。
