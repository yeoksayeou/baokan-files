Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 5th: Due to the opponent's continued insistence on unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs and refusal to release and repatriate all our captured personnel after the armistice, the subcommittees of the third and fourth agenda items of the Korean armistice negotiations on January 5th still made no progress.

    In the third agenda item subcommittee, the opposing side adopted an attitude of fundamentally unwilling to solve the problem, and bluntly and unreasonably demanded interference in our internal affairs and infringement of our sovereignty, claiming: "Words like sovereignty and internal affairs are meaningless." The other side even arrogantly boasted of its military strength as a threat, claiming: "Attacking China is a very simple matter, as easy as child's play." Our representative sternly pointed out: "Today the power of the people has grown stronger; the days when you could casually fly in a few planes or sail in a few warships and scare people are long gone. Our side's repeated propositions and proposals in the armistice negotiation meetings have announced to the world our determination and efforts to strive for a stable and effective armistice and a complete and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. But if your side does not have the ability to learn from experience and attempts to use military force to achieve your goals of interfering in internal affairs and infringing on sovereignty, this arrogant attempt will encounter a fatal blow."

    In the fourth agenda item subcommittee, our representative refuted the so-called six-point plan proposed by the other side on January 2nd, point by point. Our representative pointed out: The first suggestion in the opposing side's proposal, namely, exchanging prisoners of war on a one-to-one basis, is obviously aimed at demanding that our side release and repatriate all of the opposing side's captured personnel, while detaining almost all of our captured personnel. The second suggestion in the opposing side's proposal: exchanging prisoners of war for civilians as hostages on a one-to-one basis. This method itself is barbaric, and the result of this method is the detention of more than 160,000 of our captured personnel, because our side fundamentally opposes exchanging returning civilians for prisoners of war. The third point openly proposes that so-called "non-repatriated" prisoners of war will be paroled instead of being sent back, which in effect sends our captured personnel to Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, the mortal enemies of the Chinese and Korean people. The opposing side's own news reports have already publicly announced that the Chiang-Rhee bandit gangs have made a request to the US government to detain our captured personnel. The opposing side's fourth point puts forward a suggestion to exchange the remaining civilians and repatriate them under the condition of "voluntary repatriation." Our side has already stated that we will unconditionally repatriate foreign civilians and civilians displaced in the war after the armistice. The so-called "voluntary repatriation" condition of the other side is essentially just an attempt to detain the hundreds of thousands of our civilians who were abducted during the war. The opposing side's fifth point even more absurdly suggests that the International Committee of the Red Cross should identify whether prisoners of war and civilians are "voluntarily repatriated," which is enough to prove that the opposing side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" is just a beautiful name for "attempting to detain." The opposing side's sixth proposal declares: The definition of civilians on both sides is residents of "Republic of Korea" and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on June 25, 1950, but there are no two countries in Korea at all, and the issue of civilians returning to their hometowns should not involve any political issues. Our representative sternly pointed out that the opposing side's proposal will only leave a shameful record in modern history, and it is what our side can never tolerate.

    美方继续坚持无理要求谈判仍无进展
    我方逐项驳斥对方“六点方案”
    指出对方提案只能在近代史上留下可耻的纪录
    【新华社开城五日电】由于对方继续坚持干涉我方内政的无理要求，并拒绝在停战后释放与遣回我方全体被俘人员，一月五日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程与第四项议程的小组委员会仍然毫无进展。
    在第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方采取了根本不愿解决问题的态度，蛮横无理地直率要求干涉我方内政和侵犯我方的主权，声称：“主权和内政这类支离破碎的字句，毫无任何意义。”对方更狂妄地吹嘘其军事力量以作为威胁，声称：“攻击中国是非常简单的事情，有如儿戏一般的容易。”我方代表严词指出：“今天人民的力量已经壮大了；你们可以随便飞来几架飞机，开来几条军舰就把人吓倒的时代早已过去了。我方在停战谈判会议中历次的主张和历次的提案，已经将我方争取稳定和有效的停战，以及彻底和平解决朝鲜问题的决心和努力公告了全世界。但你方如果没有接受经验教训的能力，妄图以军事力量来达到你方干涉内政、侵犯主权的目的，这种狂妄的企图将遭遇到致命的打击。”
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表逐项驳斥对方一月二日所提出的所谓六点方案。我方代表指出：对方提案中的第一条建议，即在一对一的基础上交换战俘，其目的显然是企图要求我方释放并遣回对方的全体被俘人员，却扣留几近全部的我方被俘人员。对方提案中的第二条建议：在一对一的基础上以战俘作为人质与平民互相交换，这种办法本身是野蛮的，这种办法的结果是扣留我方十六万余被俘人员，因我方根本反对以还乡平民与战俘相交换。第三条公然提出对于所谓“不愿遣返”的战俘，将予以假释而不予遣送，实际上即将我方被俘人员送交中朝人民死敌蒋介石与李承晚。对方自己的新闻报道中，早已公开地宣布李蒋匪帮向美国政府提出了扣留我方被俘人员的要求。对方第四条提出所谓交换剩余的平民，在“自愿遣返”的条件下，予以遣送的建议。我方早已声明我方将在停战后无条件遣返外籍平民，及战争中流离失所的平民。对方所谓“自愿遣返”的条件，实质上只是企图扣留在战争中所掳去的我方数十万平民。对方第五条更荒谬地建议由红十字国际委员会来鉴别战俘与平民是否“自愿遣返”，这正足以证明对方所谓“自愿遣返”，只是“企图扣留”的美名。对方提案第六条宣称：双方平民的定义是一九五零年六月二十五日“大韩民国”和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的居民，但朝鲜根本没有两个国家，平民返乡的问题，更不应该牵涉到任何政治问题。我方代表严词指出对方的提案只能在近代史上留下可耻的纪录，而是我方所决不能容忍的。
