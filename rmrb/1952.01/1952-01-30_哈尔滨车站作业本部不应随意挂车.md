    The Harbin Station Operations Department Should Not Randomly Attach Railcars
    On January 15th, a train of empty cars (55 cars) arrived at Harbin Station. Before this train left for Zhaodong, the conductor discovered that 15 small cars were attached inside the train. These small cars were unsuitable for carrying grain to Zhaodong. The conductor immediately went to the Harbin Station Operations Department and requested that they detach these small cars for other uses. However, personnel at the Station Operations Department, in order to save trouble, ignored this suggestion and ordered the train to depart. When the train arrived at Zhaodong, the 15 small cars could not be used for loading and were pulled back to Harbin Station. This wasted a total of 153 car-hours, equivalent to 2.2 million yuan. This unnecessary loss could have been completely avoided. The responsible cadres of the Harbin Station Operations Department should investigate this matter. Léi Zhēng

    哈尔滨车站作业本部不应随意挂车
    一月十五日，一列空车（五十五辆）到达哈尔滨车站。在这列车开往肇东前，车长发现列车内部挂有十五辆小型车，而这类小型车是不适合到肇东去装粮食的。车长立即到哈尔滨车站作业本部，要求他们把这些小型车甩下作其他用途。但车站作业本部人员为了省事，不理会这个意见，就命令开车。这列车到了肇东，十五辆小型车因不能装用，又被拉回哈尔滨车站。这次共浪费了一百五十三个车小时，等于二百二十多万元。这种不应有的损失是完全可以避免的。哈尔滨车站作业本部负责干部应检查这件事。　雷徵
