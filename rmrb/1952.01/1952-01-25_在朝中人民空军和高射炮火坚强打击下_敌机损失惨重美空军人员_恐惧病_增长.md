    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, January 24th: Under the strong blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's anti-aircraft fire and the People's Air Force, the invading U.S. Air Force has suffered heavy losses, and "fear disease" is rapidly growing among U.S. Air Force personnel.
    On the morning of New Year's Day, 1952, Volunteer Army anti-aircraft gunners shot down an aircraft belonging to the U.S. Marine Corps' 12th Air Group on a certain position. The pilot of this aircraft, Captain Gilardi, abandoned the burning aircraft and parachuted to the ground, where he was captured by Volunteer Army soldiers. Gilardi said that when he was ordered to take off that morning to bomb and strafe peaceful Korean cities, he repeatedly prayed to God, hoping to avoid the blows of the Chinese People's Air Force or ground anti-aircraft fire on this "good day." But shortly after he flew into the northern Korean airspace, he was shot down by anti-aircraft shells. Gilardi confessed that a "fear disease" is now prevalent in the invading U.S. Air Force. Aircraft pilots are worried day and night that they will be hit by ground anti-aircraft fire during flight, or lose their lives in combat. He said that in his unit, some people were like mental patients, often shouting in panic during their sleep because they dreamed of being attacked by the Chinese People's Air Force or ground anti-aircraft units, and prayed to God for protection before each departure. He himself was one of those suffering from "fear disease." Maurice, a captain pilot of the 102nd Air Group of the U.S. Navy's 77th Task Force, who was captured in November, said that in order to save his life, he had tried everything possible to bypass areas where anti-aircraft fire was being launched on several flights over northern Korea, and tried to fly higher. However, he still did not escape the terrifying "white smoke puffs" densely covering the sky.
    In order to salvage its declining air force morale, the American aggressors deceived pilots by saying that they could return home after flying a thousand times. But the pilots knew how hopeless this was. Lieutenant Swart, a pilot of the 67th Squadron of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing, 18th Group, U.S. Air Force, who was captured on the same day as Gilardi at dusk, said that the pilots of his 18th Group are now generally troubled by this terrible "thousand times." Swart was shot down after only twelve flights. Lieutenant Steiner, a pilot of the 3rd Squadron, 3rd Bomber Group, U.S. Air Force, was shot down on his 26th flight. Gilardi had flown a relatively high number of times; he had flown 86 times, but on his 87th flight, he finally became a prisoner.
    These captured U.S. Air Force personnel also confessed that under the increasingly strong blows of the Chinese People's troops' anti-aircraft fire and the People's Air Force, the losses of the invading U.S. Air Force are becoming more and more serious. Swart said that the 18th Group of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing of the U.S. Air Force, where he was stationed, had already had seven aircraft shot down and twelve damaged in the forty-one days from November 22 last year to New Year's Day this year. Once, when the aircraft of his wing were escorting eight B29 bombers to intrude into northern Korea, seven were shot down in one fell swoop. Maurice said that these loss figures were not surprising. The 102nd Air Group of the U.S. Navy's 77th Task Force had 92 aircraft when it participated in the war of aggression against Korea on May 30 last year, and by November 25, it had lost 45; half of the sixteen aircraft in his 923rd Squadron had been lost. The heavy blows suffered by the U.S. aggressor troops are not only the loss of aircraft. Due to the heavy casualties of air force personnel, the U.S. aggressors have had to transfer a large number of reserve personnel to supplement them, but they still cannot fill this "bottomless pit." For example, Lieutenant Swart entered aviation school in 1950, and after one year of flight training and six weeks of combat training, he was sent to Korea to fight on November 22 last year, but he was taken prisoner after only forty-one days. He said that among the six aircraft shot down in his group, four pilots had only been in Korea for three or four months.

    在朝中人民空军和高射炮火坚强打击下
    敌机损失惨重美空军人员“恐惧病”增长
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军高射炮火和人民空军的坚强打击下，侵朝美国空军损失惨重，在美空军人员中正迅速地增长着“恐惧病”。
    一九五二年元旦的早晨，志愿军高射炮手在某处阵地上击落了一架属于美国海军陆战队第十二空军大队的飞机。这架飞机的驾驶员上尉吉拉第丢开了起火的飞机跳伞降落，被志愿军战士俘虏。吉拉第说，当他在这天早晨奉命出发轰炸、扫射朝鲜和平城市的时候，他曾一再向上帝祷告，希望在这个“好日子”里侥幸避过朝中人民空军或地面高射炮火的打击。但当他飞进朝鲜北部上空不久，就被高射炮弹击落了下来。吉拉第供说：在侵朝美国空军中，现在正普遍增长着一种“恐惧病”。飞机驾驶员们日夜耽心自己在飞行时会被地面高射炮火击中，或在战斗中丧失性命。他说，在他所在的部队里，有人像患了精神病，在睡梦中常常因为做梦遭受朝中人民空军或地面高射炮部队的打击而惊慌地叫喊起来，在每次出发前都要祈求上帝保祐。他自己也就是患“恐惧病”的一个。在十一月间被俘的美海军第七十七派遣舰队第一零二空军大队上尉驾驶员莫瑞兹说，为了保全性命，他多次飞行到朝鲜北部上空都想尽一切办法绕过发射高射炮火的地区，并且努力飞得更高些。但是，他仍然没有逃出这可怕的密布天空的“朵朵白烟”。
    美国侵略者为了挽救它日益低落的空军士气，欺骗飞行员说凡飞行满一千次就可以回家。但飞行员们都知道这是多么无望的事。与吉拉第同一天黄昏被俘的美空军第十八战斗轰炸机联队十八大队六十七中队少尉驾驶员斯瑞特说，他所在的十八大队的飞行员们，现在已普遍为这个可怕的“一千次”而苦恼着。斯瑞特只飞行了十二次就被打落下来。另一个被俘的美空军第三轰炸机大队第三中队中尉驾驶员斯坦纳作第二十六次飞行时就被打落下来了。吉拉第飞行的次数算是比较高的，他已经飞行了八十六次，但他飞行到第八十七次终于也当了俘虏。
    这些美国空军俘虏同时供认了在朝中人民部队的高射炮火和人民空军愈来愈坚强的打击下，侵朝美国空军的损失愈来愈严重。斯瑞特说，他所在的美空军第十八战斗轰炸机联队十八大队，从去年十一月二十二日到今年元旦的四十一天中，就已经被击落飞机七架、被击伤十二架。有一次，他所在联队的飞机掩护八架B29型轰炸机向朝鲜北部侵扰时，一次就被击落了七架。莫瑞兹说，这些损失数字还不足为奇。美海军第七十七派遣舰队第一零二空军大队在去年五月三十日参加侵朝战争时有九十二架飞机，到十一月二十五日已经损失了四十五架；他所在的九百二十三中队的十六架飞机已经损失了一半。美国侵略军所遭到的沉重的打击，还不仅是飞机的损失。由于空军人员伤亡惨重，美国侵略者不得不抽调大批后备人员来补充，但仍然填不满这个“无底洞”。如少尉驾驶员斯瑞特是一九五零年考入航空学校的，经过一年的飞行训练和六个星期的战斗训练，在去年十一月二十二日被派到朝鲜作战，但是仅四十一天就当了俘虏。他说，他所在的大队的被击落的六架飞机中，有四个飞行员来到朝鲜才只有三、四个月。
