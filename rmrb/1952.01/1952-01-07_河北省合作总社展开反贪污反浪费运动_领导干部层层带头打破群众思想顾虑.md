Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 3rd. The Hebei Provincial Cooperative Headquarters' anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign has made preliminary progress due to the leading cadres taking the lead at all levels and fully promoting democracy. In the early stages of the movement, there were many ideological concerns among the cadres. Some cadres believed that reporting problems would probably not be resolved. Some cadres feared suppression and retaliation. Still other cadres thought that they "have no power and no money, so what is there to rectify?" Most cadres were watching to see if the leadership had the determination and were hesitant to move forward. The Cooperative Headquarters' Thrift Inspection Committee studied these ideological situations and believed that the key to mobilizing the masses lay in the leadership setting an example. Therefore, the Director and Deputy Director of the Cooperative Headquarters, Wang Jinshan and Han Shaobai, respectively, made mobilization reports in light of the situation within the organization, and publicly examined their own bureaucratic work styles and extravagant waste with a spirit of criticism and self-criticism. They emphasized that everyone should boldly expose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and that the leadership would guarantee to support everyone. After the report, all staff members were very excited. Some cadres said: "This report is very good. If the leadership had expressed such an attitude earlier, we would not have doubted it." During the development of the movement, some cadres in some groups raised the question: "Will there be retaliation in the future even if there is no retaliation now? It would be better to set up a suggestion box to make it easier to report." The Thrift Inspection Committee immediately conducted in-depth investigations and found that some cadres still had concerns about certain middle and lower-level leading cadres and could not speak freely. The committee realized that in such a large organization with many people, it was not only the top leaders who had bureaucracy, but also the responsible cadres at all levels. It was decided that the responsible cadres of each department, section, and group should first conduct in-depth self-examinations within their own units. In addition, the Thrift Inspection Committee sent inspection teams to cooperate with administrative and Communist Party organizations, as well as activists in the movement, to conduct in-depth investigations, clarify the nature of the problems, and promptly resolve the problems that had been discovered. Everyone said with satisfaction: "If we do this, any problem can be solved." After accountant Wang Zhenjiu reported the cases of corruption and bribery by Zhou Ying, Han Guoxiang and other responsible cadres of the agency's Suiyuan working group, the leadership promptly praised him at the meeting and hired him to participate in the work of the inspection team. This further dispelled everyone's ideological concerns about "fear of retaliation."

All staff members of the agency were mobilized under the leadership of cadres at all levels. Most cadres examined their mistakes with the spirit of "knowing everything and saying everything" and boldly reported the corruption and waste of others.

In order to vigorously and deeply carry out this movement, the Provincial Cooperative Headquarters has issued a notice to its subordinate cooperatives and relevant departments, requesting them to criticize or report on the Provincial Cooperative Headquarters and its staff.

    河北省合作总社展开反贪污反浪费运动
    领导干部层层带头打破群众思想顾虑
    【新华社保定三日电】河北省合作总社的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，由于领导干部以身作则，层层带头，充分发扬民主，现已初步展开。在运动初期，干部中存在着许多思想顾虑。有些干部认为反映问题恐怕也不会得到解决。有些干部怕压制、怕报复。还有些干部认为自己“既没权、又没钱，有啥可整？”多数干部在观望领导方面有没有决心，表现迟疑不前。合作总社节约检查委员会研究了这些思想情况，认为发动群众的关键在于领导方面要以身作则。于是合作总社正、副主任王金山、韩少白等联系社内情况分别作了动员报告，以批评和自我批评的精神，当众检查了自己的官僚主义作风和铺张浪费行为，并强调说明大家要大胆揭发贪污、浪费和官僚主义等行为，领导方面保证替大家撑腰。报告后全体工作人员都很振奋。有些干部说：“这次报告很好。如果领导上早表示这样的态度，我们早就不怀疑了。”运动开展中，有些小组的干部又提出：“现在不报复，将来是否要报复？不如设立个意见箱，检举着也方便。”节约检查委员会当即深入了解，发现有些干部对某些中、下层的领导干部仍怀有顾虑，因而不能畅所欲言。委员会由此认识到在这样机关大、人员多的单位内，不单是最高负责人有官僚主义，就在各级负责干部中也有官僚主义，当决定各处、各科、各组的负责干部都要逐级在本单位首先以身作则进行深入检查。此外，节约检查委员会又派出检查小组，配合行政和共产党的组织以及运动中的积极分子深入调查，弄清问题的性质，及时解决已发现的问题。大家满意地说：“这样作，什么问题也能解决了。”会计王振九检举了该社驻绥远工作组负责干部周英、韩国香等贪污受贿的案件后，领导方面在大会上及时进行了表扬，并聘请他参加检查小组的工作。这样便进
    一步打破了大家“怕报复”的思想顾虑。
    全社工作人员在领导干部层层带头下发动起来了。大部分干部都以“知无不言、言无不尽”的精神来检查自己的错误，并大胆检举别人的贪污、浪费行为。
    为了大张旗鼓深入开展这一运动，省合作总社已向所属下级合作社及有关部门发出通知，要求对省合作总社和工作人员，提出批评或检举。
