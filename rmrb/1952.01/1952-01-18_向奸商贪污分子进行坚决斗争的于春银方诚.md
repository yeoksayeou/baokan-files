    Yu Chunyin Fights Resolutely Against Unscrupulous Merchants and Corrupt Elements
    Fang Cheng Zhang Mai
    Comrade Yu Chunyin, the group leader of the patrol team at the Maigen Road Goods Depot of Shanghai Station, is a model for protecting state property. He is loyal, honest, and incorruptible, and has waged tireless and resolute struggles against unscrupulous merchants, gangsters, and corrupt elements. His spirit of struggle has inspired every employee in the depot to be determined in the fight against corruption.
    The Maigen Road Goods Depot has frequent cargo transport, with a large amount of goods being exported from here every day. In the past, this depot was the most active place for corrupt elements, unscrupulous merchants, and thieves; since Yu Chunyin became the patrol team leader, he has tightened inspections and enforced strict management, leaving no loopholes for corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants to exploit. However, corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants did not give up; they tried every means to break through this barrier. How to break through? They learned that Yu Chunyin's family was poor, so the merchant Zhang Decai came forward and gave him a large wad of banknotes, as well as ham, clothing materials, and so on. This approach failed. Yu Chunyin sternly refused. But the unscrupulous merchants still thought that Yu Chunyin felt the bribe was too small this time, and they continued to use more bribes to buy him off. They were met with Yu Chunyin's scolding: "You want to do illegal things and try to fish me in! Shameless things!" "If you bring these dirty things again, I will send you to the Public Security Bureau!"
    At first, Yu Chunyin's wife was very dissatisfied with him, often grumbling in his ear: "You get 4-500,000 yuan a month, and there are eight people in the family. Life is so tight, don't you plan for yourself? People are offering money, but you don't want it. You're really crazy!" Yu Chunyin ignored her at the time, and when he had time, he would reason with her: "When the Japanese devils ruled, I begged outside. You still remember that, right? When the Kuomintang ruled, I worked desperately at the Maigen Road Station for two or three years and was still a temporary worker. Who treated me like a human being! If it weren't for the Communist Party, could we eat so full and dress so warmly today? Still not satisfied!" He often said to his wife: "If I take bribes, the family will temporarily eat and wear better, but then I will have to turn a blind eye to them smuggling and stealing things, and the country's losses will be great. Besides, if I do such an ugly thing, others will point at your back and scold you for being a corrupt wife, and scold Wanzhong (Yu Chunyin's son) for being a corrupt brat. Do you want others to scold you like that?" His wife listened to her husband's reasonable words, and her thinking was straightened out. From then on, corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants dared not come to Yu Chunyin's door again.
    Seeing that "bribery" did not work, the corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants shamelessly and fiercely wrote two threatening letters to Yu Chunyin in succession. The letters said:
    "If you don't loosen up a bit, we'll take your life." Yu Chunyin was not afraid at all. On the one hand, he reported the matter to his superiors and the local Public Security Bureau; on the other hand, he raised his vigilance and stepped up patrols. In a short period, he successively uncovered more than ten cases of theft and smuggling. Therefore, he aroused even more jealousy and hatred from corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants. These villains colluded to plot against him. Once, they pre-arranged a conspiracy, inviting Yu Chunyin to Dayang Bridge to check smuggled goods, attempting to take the opportunity to kill him. Fortunately, he was vigilant and did not fall into the trap of the conspirators.
    However, last year, he was finally injured. The matter was like this: a smuggling group headed by a man named Tian was carrying forty pounds of saccharin in their luggage, which was seized by Yu Chunyin; the second and third times, they carried twenty-five pounds and forty-eight pounds of saccharin respectively (worth more than 50 million yuan in total), which were also seized by Yu Chunyin one after another. When the first time they were caught, the man named Tian found some accomplices and stuffed a stack of banknotes into Yu Chunyin's hands, asking him to "be lenient". Yu Chunyin resolutely refused. These guys then offered him bribes twice and threatened him, saying, "If you don't know what's good for you, let's fight!" Because Yu Chunyin was firm in his position and loved the motherland, he was not only unmoved by threats and bribes, but also more loyal to his duties, stepping up patrols, thus increasing the state's tax revenue and freight charges by more than 10 million yuan. Soon, these shameless people pre-arranged a conspiracy: putting a bundle of bamboo under a truck, placing two trucks face to face, and calling Yu Chunyin to inspect. When Yu Chunyin bent down, the man named Tian instigated the truck driver to reverse the truck. Yu Chunyin couldn't retreat in time, and four of his ribs were broken by the truck, and he spat blood. His superiors immediately sent him to the railway hospital for treatment, and the murderers were arrested on the spot by public security personnel. It turned out that since receiving Yu Chunyin's report, the Public Security Bureau had been conducting close surveillance of these shameless guys.
    The news of Yu Chunyin's glorious injury quickly spread throughout Shanghai Station. The Shanghai Station Party Branch, the administrative responsible comrades of the Maigen Road Goods Depot, and the employees all went to the hospital to express their cordial condolences to him. Because Yu Chunyin showed a high degree of class consciousness and fighting spirit in defending state property, the Shanghai Station Party Branch, based on his application to join the Party and with the approval of the higher-level Party organization, admitted him into the glorious Chinese Communist Party. Lying in the hospital bed, Comrade Yu Chunyin was moved to tears upon hearing this news. He raised his fist and firmly said, "I will serve the people better to repay the Party and the people for the glory they have given me!"
    After more than a month of treatment, although Yu Chunyin's injuries had recovered, but he was still coughing up blood, he resolutely demanded to return to his post. His work was even more active than before. He often wrapped himself in a large coat and slept on the sofa in the office, getting up two or three times a night in the freezing cold to patrol everywhere.
    After the vigorous anti-corruption struggle was launched, Yu Chunyin not only became more energetic in his work, but also carefully persuaded Wang Asong, Fu Wenju, and others who had made mistakes to confess their past corruption to the organization, and also reported a corrupt element named Lu. Now, he is still investigating and studying the facts of several people suspected of corruption, preparing to mobilize them to take the road of confession and self-salvation. At present, under his education and influence, the class consciousness of the sixteen patrolmen has also gradually improved. They are united around him, waging a tenacious struggle against those villains who violate the law by smuggling and stealing state and people's property.

    向奸商贪污分子进行坚决斗争的于春银
    方诚　张迈
    上海车站麦根路货栈巡守队小组长于春银同志，是保护国家财产的模范。他忠诚老实，廉洁奉公，并和奸商、歹徒、贪污分子作了不懈的坚决的斗争。他这种斗争精神，鼓舞了栈内每个职工反贪污斗争的决心。
    麦根路货栈货运频繁，每天从这儿输出大量的货物。从前，这个货栈是贪污分子、奸商、小偷最活跃的场所；自从于春银做了巡守组长以后，查得紧，管得严，贪污分子和奸商就无空可钻了。但贪污分子、奸商等并没有死心，他们想尽办法要突破这一关。怎样突破呢？他们打听到于春银家里穷苦，便由商人张德才出面，送给他一大把钞票，还有火腿、衣料等。这一套没有成功。于春银严厉地拒绝了。但奸商们还以为于春银嫌这回的贿赂太少，他们继续用更多的贿赂来买通他。他们遭到了于春银的痛骂：“你们想做违法的事情，来向我钓鱼！这批不要脸的东西！”“你们再把这些脏东西拿来，我就把你们送到公安局去！”
    起初，于春银的妻子对他非常不满，经常在他耳边叽哩咕噜：“你一个月拿四、五十万元工钱，家里八口人，日子多紧，你就不替自己打算打算，人家把钱送上门，你不要，真是疯了！”于春银当时不理睬她，有空时就给她讲道理：“在日本鬼子统治的时候，我在外面讨饭，你总还记得吧！国民党统治的时候，我在麦根路站拚死卖活干了两三年，还是个临时工，谁把我当人看待！要不是共产党来了，我们今天能吃得这样饱饱的、穿得这样暖暖的？还不知足！”他还常常对他妻子说：“假如我受了贿赂，家里一时吃的穿的都更好些，但是，那就要睁着眼睛看他们走私，偷东西，国家的损失可就大了。再说，我做了这种丑事，别人就会指着你的背脊骨，骂你是贪污婆子，骂万忠（于春银的儿子）是贪污崽子。难道你愿意别人这样骂吗？”他的妻子听丈夫说得有理，思想便搞通了。从此，贪污分子和奸商再也不敢找上于春银的门了。
    贪污分子和奸商们看到“利诱”行不通，竟无耻地凶恶地接连给于春银写了两次恐吓信。信上说：
    “你再不放松点，我们就要你的命。”于春银丝毫不畏惧。他一方面把这件事报告上级和当地公安局，一方面提高警惕，加紧巡查。在短短一个期间，他曾陆续查获偷窃案和走私案十多件。因此，他更引起了贪污分子和奸商们的嫉恨。这批蟊贼们就串通起来想暗害他。有一次，他们事先布置好阴谋，邀于春银到大洋桥去查私货，企图乘机害死他。幸亏他机警，没有堕入陷害者的圈套。
    但是，去年，他终于受伤了。事情经过是这样的：有一个姓田的为首的走私集团，在行李中私带了四十磅糖精，被于春银查获了；第二次、第三次，他们又分别带了二十五磅和四十八磅糖精（总共值五千余万元），也先后被于春银查获了。当第一次被查获时，姓田的找了几个同伙，拿了一叠钞票往于春银手里塞，要他“马虎”一点。被于春银坚决地拒绝了。这些家伙接着又向他送了两次贿赂，并威胁说：“再不识相，咱们来拚命吧！”由于于春银立场坚定，热爱祖国，不仅没有被威胁和利诱所动摇，且更忠于职守，加紧巡查，这样便替国家增加了一千多万元的税收和运费。不久，这批无耻之徒便预先布置好阴谋：把一捆竹子放在卡车底下，把两辆卡车面对面摆着，喊于春银去检查。当于春银弯身时，姓田的就唆使卡车司机倒车，于春银退让不及，肋骨被卡车撞断了四根，口吐鲜血。上级立即把他送到铁路医院医治，凶手们当场也被公安人员逮捕。原来公安局自从得到于春银的报告后，就对这些无耻的家伙进行了严密的监视。
    于春银光荣受伤的消息马上传遍了上海站，上海站党支部、麦根路货栈的行政负责同志和员工们，都到医院里去亲切地慰问他。由于于春银表现了高度的阶级觉悟和保卫国家财产的战斗精神，上海站党支部根据他的入党要求，并经上级党组织的批准，吸收他加入了光荣的中国共产党。躺在病床上的于春银同志听到这个消息，感动得流下泪来，他举起拳头，坚决地说：“我要更好地为人民服务，来报答党和人民给我的光荣！”
    经过一个多月的医治，于春银的伤势虽已平复，但还咯着血，他就坚决要求回到工作岗位去。他的工作比以前更积极了，常常用件大衣裹着就睡在办公室的沙发上，在寒风凛冽中，一夜爬起来两三遍，到处巡查。
    在大张旗鼓地展开反贪污斗争后，于春银不仅在工作中劲头更大了，还细心劝导曾经犯过错误的王阿松、傅文举等向组织上坦白过去的贪污事实，并又检举了一个姓陆的贪污分子。现在，他还正在调查研究几个有贪污嫌疑的人的事实，准备动员他们走上坦白自救的道路。目前，在他的教育和影响下，十六个巡守员的阶级觉悟也逐渐提高了，共同团结在他的周围，向那些违法走私、盗窃国家人民财产的蟊贼，进行顽强的斗争。
