    Korean Hero Kang Bo Who Sunk and Damaged Twenty-Five Enemy Ships
  　Wu Ming
    Comrade Kang Bo, a Korean naval hero and old comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people, who once led his sailors to sink and damage twenty-five enemy ships, has come to our country with the Korean People's Delegation.
    Lieutenant Colonel Kang Bo grew up on Jeju Island and received specialized nautical training. In 1943, he and forty other compatriots escaped from their homeland, which was occupied by the Japanese invaders. They encountered a storm at sea and drifted to Dongtai County in northern Jiangsu Province, China. After landing, they met the New Fourth Army, and from then on, he and his companions joined the Chinese revolutionary work. In 1946, he went to the famous Li Hongguang Detachment of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army as a political instructor of the battalion, and joined the Communist Party of China on July 1 of the same year. In the Battle of Gushanling, he led a battalion to successfully complete the arduous task of blocking three divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. Because of his heroic fighting, he was awarded three Class A Merits by the Chinese people. In the battle to liberate Fushun, he bled for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people.
    In the spring of 1948, he returned to his liberated homeland and worked in the Korean People's Navy.
    After the outbreak of the American invasion of Korea in June 1950, Comrade Kang Bo was ordered to lead twenty wooden boats to transport the famous XX Division to fight behind enemy lines. They crossed the turbulent sea, breaking through the enemy's obstructions and blockades, and safely reached their destination. After this division landed, it advanced rapidly southward along the east coast, capturing Samcheok, Uljin, and Haening, all the way to Pohang. In this outstanding operation, he was awarded the Third Class National Flag Medal for the first time.
    In August 1950, the American invaders' Seventh Fleet concentrated dozens of gunboats to bombard a certain port. Comrade Kang Bo was ordered to transport a large number of mines from land to the outside of the port in a certain place to lay them. At this time, he did not have a single ship under his command. They found two broken wooden boats, repaired them with cotton, and used these two broken boats to lay mines in the sea where dozens of enemy ships were gathered.
    At night, the wind and waves were very high, and the searchlights on the enemy ships illuminated the entire sea surface. Comrade Kang Bo led his sailors, taking advantage of the dense night fog, and slipped through the enemy's artillery fire, placing the mines one by one on the channel in the gaps between the enemy ships. In the early morning, when they returned to port victoriously, there were several loud explosions on the sea surface. Two enemy destroyers and a landing craft were punished by the heroes and buried on the seabed of Korea!
    In late August, Comrade Kang Bo was once again ordered to lay mines in a certain area. At this time, the activities of enemy ships on the east coast were even more rampant, and the harassment of enemy aircraft also intensified. Comrade Kang Bo modified a small steamboat and went on a mission on a stormy night. When their work was about to be completed, they suddenly discovered that an enemy ship only four hundred meters away was pouncing on them. The situation was very critical, but Comrade Kang Bo ordered the sailors not to retreat until the mission was completed. Finally, when they finished laying the mines and turned back, an enemy ship was only two hundred meters away from them. The crazy enemy ship dared to vainly attempt to capture our heroes, but the mines laid by the heroes blocked its way. This enemy ship struck a mine and sank. At this time, a large number of enemy ships discovered Comrade Kang Bo's small steamboat, and fierce artillery fire came from all directions, but the heroes still safely returned to their base.
    For the two military achievements in August, Comrade Kang Bo was awarded the Second Class "Yi Sun-sin Medal" again (specifically awarded to the Navy, equivalent to the Second Class National Flag Medal). The sailors under his command continued to strike the enemy in a ghostly manner, guarding hundreds of miles of the east coast. When the People's Army took the initiative to withdraw to the north, they laid a large number of mines in the sea area of a certain place. Two days later, three enemy destroyers and four landing craft were sunk, and two landing craft were damaged. Comrade Kang Bo was awarded the Third Class National Flag Medal for the second time, and was promoted from Major to Lieutenant Colonel.
    In February 1951, the enemy concentrated more than 100 warships of the so-called "Joint Fleet" of the United States, Britain, France, and other countries to invade a certain port and occupied the nearby small islands, attempting to land and invade again. Lieutenant Colonel Kang Bo was ordered to lay mines in the sea area here. This mission was more difficult than before, and there was a lack of ships, but he led the sailors to modify the ships themselves, maneuvering outside the port and confronting the enemy's powerful fleet, sinking one enemy destroyer and one minesweeper that attempted to invade the port. Afterwards, they carried out such missions continuously for more than five times, preventing enemy ships from approaching.
    Up to now, the sailors led by Lieutenant Colonel Kang Bo have sunk and damaged a total of twenty-five enemy ships. Comrade Kang Bo has continuously won a First Class National Flag Medal and a Third Class National Flag Medal. The Korean people also awarded him the most glorious title - "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea." (Image attached)

    击沉击伤了二十五艘敌舰的朝鲜英雄康波
  　吴明
    曾经率领他的水兵们击沉击伤敌人舰艇二十五艘的朝鲜海军英雄、中国人民的老战友康波中校，这次随同朝鲜人民访华代表团到我国来了。
    康波中校生长在济州岛，受过航海的专门训练。一九四三年，他和四十几个同胞从被日寇占领的祖国逃出来。他们在海上遇了风暴，飘泊到我国苏北东台县境着陆。上岸后遇到了新四军，从此他和他的同伴们就参加了中国革命工作。一九四六年，他到东北民主联军中著名的李红光支队担任大队政治教导员，同年七月一日加入中国共产党。在孤山岭战斗中，他曾率领一个大队胜利地完成阻击蒋匪军三个师的艰巨任务。由于他的英勇作战，他先后为中国人民立了三次大功。在解放抚顺的战斗中，他曾为中国人民的革命事业而负伤流血。
    一九四八年春，他回到解放了的祖国，在朝鲜人民海军工作。
    一九五○年六月美国侵朝战争发生后，康波同志就奉命带领二十几只木船，把著名的某师团输送到敌人背后去作战。他们穿过波浪翻滚的海面，冲破敌人的重重阻挠和封锁，安全地达到了目的地。这个师团登陆以后，沿东海岸向南急进，连克三陟、蔚珍、海宁等地，一直打到浦项。在这次杰出的作战中，他第一次获得了三级国旗勋章。
    一九五○年八月，美国侵略者第七舰队，集中了数十艘炮舰向某地港口轰击。康波同志奉命从陆路运去大批机雷到某地港外敷设。这时，他的手下没有一只舰艇，他们就找了两条破木船，用棉花把船补好，就凭这两条破船在聚集着几十艘敌舰的海面上去布雷。
    夜晚，风浪很大，敌舰上的探照灯照亮了整个海面。康波同志率领自己的水兵，乘夜雾弥漫时，穿过敌人的炮火，在敌舰往来如梭的空隙中，把机雷一个一个地安放在海道上。清晨，当他们胜利返港时，海面接连发出几声轰隆巨响，敌人的两艘驱逐舰和一只登陆艇，受到了英雄们的惩罚，埋葬在朝鲜的海底下了！
    八月下旬，康波同志再次奉命到某地敷雷。这时敌舰在东海岸的活动更猖狂了，而且敌机的袭扰也加剧。康波同志改造了一只小火轮，在一个狂风暴雨的夜晚去执行任务。当他们的工作快要完成时，忽然发现离他们只有四百公尺远的一只敌舰向他们猛扑过来。这时的情况非常紧急，可是康波同志命令水兵们坚决不完成任务不后退。最后，当他们把机雷敷设完了转棹回来时，一只敌舰离他们只有二百公尺远了。疯狂的敌舰竟敢妄想俘掳我们的英雄们，可是英雄们敷设的机雷阻住了它的出路。这只敌舰触雷沉没了。这时，大批敌舰发现了康波同志的小火轮，猛烈的炮火从四面飞来，但英雄们仍旧安全返回了基地。
    八月里的两次战功，康波同志又获得了二级“李舜臣勋章”（专授予海军的，相当于二级国旗勋章）。他所率领的水兵们，继续神出鬼没地打击敌人，守卫东海岸数百里的海面。人民军主动北撤时，他们在某地海面上敷设了大批水雷。两天以后，三艘敌人的驱逐舰、四只登陆艇被炸沉了，还有两只登陆艇被炸伤。康波同志第二次荣获三级国旗勋章，并由少校晋升中校。
    在一九五一年二月间，敌人集中美、英、法等所谓“联合舰队”的各种军舰一百多艘向某港进犯，并占领了附近的小海岛，企图再次登陆进犯。康波中校又奉命在这里的海面布雷。这次的任务比以前更艰巨，舰艇也缺乏，可是他率领水兵们自己改装船艇，在港外和敌人的强大舰队周旋，把企图侵入港内的敌人驱逐舰和扫雷艇各一艘击沉了。以后他们连续执行了五次以上的这种任务，使敌舰不敢接近。
    到现在，康波中校率领的水兵们，总共击沉击伤敌人舰艇二十五艘了。康波同志又连续获得了一次一级国旗勋章和一次三级国旗勋章。朝鲜人民并授予他最光荣的称号——“朝鲜人民共和国英雄”。（附图片）
