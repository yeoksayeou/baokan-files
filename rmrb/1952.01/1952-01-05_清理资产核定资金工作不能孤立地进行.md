Cleaning up asset verification funds cannot be carried out in isolation
Ye Feng, Director of Nanjing Electric Power Bureau

    The work of cleaning up asset verification funds at the Nanjing Electric Power Bureau has basically come to an end, except for the final verification of funds, which is still awaiting review and approval by the Asset Verification Fund Committee of the General Administration of Electric Power Management.
    The entire process of cleaning up asset verification funds in our bureau lasted three and a half months, from mid-July to late October last year. Throughout this process, we deeply realized that: to do a good job in cleaning up asset verification funds, we must first eliminate the pure task viewpoint from the minds of leading cadres (the erroneous understanding of conducting this work in isolation, solely for the purpose of creating a reliable set of asset accounts, etc.). Leading cadres should recognize that this is a historical task to improve our enterprise management and conduct a comprehensive inspection. This is a learning movement to examine the past, face reality, and improve future management. Leading cadres must have a comprehensive, complete, and developmental ideological perspective to guide the work in order to achieve richer results in cleaning up asset verification funds.
    Cleaning up asset verification funds should be combined with strengthening the class education of workers' sense of ownership. For all employees, cleaning up asset verification funds is an unfamiliar new topic. In the past era of bureaucratic capitalist rule, the true content of an enterprise was only a secret to a few bureaucratic capitalists and their "confidants," and had nothing to do with all employees. If we only hand over the task of cleaning up asset verification funds to a few managers today, it will not only lead to "nothing being accomplished" but also lose the fundamental meaning of cleaning up asset verification funds. Leading cadres must repeatedly educate all employees to fully recognize that cleaning up asset verification funds is for the purpose of more effectively developing our national economic and defense forces and improving our own lives. Only in this way can we gain the attention and support of all employees. Only in this way can we overcome the heavy and complex difficulties and eliminate the dismissive attitude and empirical mistakes of "being too busy with production to handle it" and "two previous inventories were just a flash in the pan and nothing came of it." After the level of awareness of the employees of the Nanjing Electric Power Bureau was raised, they displayed a high degree of enthusiasm, which played a decisive role in the progress of the work of cleaning up asset verification funds. For example, when inventorying external assets, employees responded to the call of the trade union, braving the summer heat to inventory each pole despite the high mountains and long distances; and constantly researched and improved working methods, and exchanged experiences in a timely manner; the leadership continuously commended advanced workers. As a result, the work that was estimated to take three hundred and eighty workdays was completed in two hundred and twenty workdays through a crash effort. For example, under the trade union's call for "saving and opposing waste," employees put forward a number of topics on the utilization of old and waste materials, and achieved considerable results.
    Cleaning up asset verification funds should also be combined with safety inspection work. The scope of asset cleanup is wide and comprehensive, and all assets, in every corner, must be checked one by one, met one by one, without any omissions. Many people also participate in the inventory, with the responsible persons, technical staff, and skilled workers of the production site as the backbone of the inventory. Moreover, the work of cleaning up assets requires not only correct quantity data but also accurate quality data. In this way, it should and can be combined with the safety inspection that is particularly needed in electric power production. This is like a comprehensive health check of a person from history to the present. In this way, it fully exposes the blind spots that could not be seen or imagined in the past maintenance work, and provides historical, reliable, rich, and important data for the regular maintenance, daily maintenance, and operation of machinery and equipment in the future. Some of them can be repaired and resolved at that time. For example, the ventilation of a certain circulating water pump motor in the power plant was very bad, and the motor coil slot was prone to oil ingress; and the cooling water pipe at a certain place had a damaged leak, all of which were discovered by the inventory personnel one by one. The power plant quickly carried out repairs, which improved the safe use efficiency of this equipment. In the power supply department, 305 hidden accidents such as broken porcelain insulators, loose binding wires, and poor pole wood were found, and they were repaired according to their urgency, thus eliminating some possible line accidents.
    Cleaning up asset verification funds should also be combined with the preparatory work for the saving and anti-waste movement. After the comprehensive asset cleanup work, it is very clear that our bureau had serious waste in the past. According to preliminary statistics, the value of the backlog of materials in inventory alone reached 66 percent. Silicon steel sheets worth more than 20 million yuan after a little processing and repair were placed in the waste pile unattended. A small office building in the power plant was built after liberation with off-the-books materials (most of which were materials that should have been returned but were not). These many shocking concrete facts can prompt the employees of the whole bureau to realize how serious our past erroneous thinking of "only paying attention to production and not management" and lack of concern for people's property has reached. After cleaning up asset verification funds, saving materials, using our brains, and utilizing old and waste materials have begun to be valued by all employees. For example, in mid-November last year, power supply workers took the initiative to weld and repair more than a dozen old steel poles that had been broken and placed in the waste pile for many years, turning them into complete and usable good steel poles. Warehouse workers cleaned and welded more than two tons of usable bare copper wire from the pile of waste copper wire, and cleaned out 1,600 meters of wind and rain wire. These facts show that, when cleaning up assets, leading cadres should pay attention to collecting waste-related data and analyze the reasons for the waste, those caused by blind stockpiling, those caused by inaccurate material budgets, those caused by careless planning, those caused by poor management systems, and those caused by a lack of work responsibility. In this way, it provides a lot of specific data for the upcoming savings movement and lays an ideological foundation.

### 清理资产核定资金工作不能孤立地进行

    清理资产核定资金工作不能孤立地进行
    南京电业局局长  叶枫
    南京电业局的清理资产核定资金工作，除最后核定资金还有待于电业管理总局清理资产核定资金委员会审查核定外，已基本上告一段落。
    我局全部清理资产核定资金工作，自去年七月中旬起到十月下旬止，历时三个半月。在整个工作的过程中，我们更深刻地体验到：要做好清理资产核定资金工作，首先要从领导干部的思想上肃清单纯任务观点（孤立地进行这个工作，单纯为了造一束可靠的资产账册等错误认识）。领导干部应认识这是一个改善我们的企业经营、进行全面检查的历史任务。这是一个检查过去、正视现实、改善今后的经营管理的学习运动。领导干部必须具有全面的、完整的、发展的思想观点，用它来指导工作，才能使清理资产核定资金工作取得更丰富的成果。
    清理资产核定资金工作应和加强职工的主人翁思想的阶级教育相结合。清理资产核定资金工作，对全体职工来说，是一个生疏的新课题。在过去官僚资本家统治时代，一个企业的真实内容，仅是少数官僚资本家和他们的“心腹们”的机密，是与全体职工无关的。我们今天清理资产核定资金，如果仅只交给少数经理人员去办，不仅会造成“一事无成”的后果，并且丧失了清理资产核定资金的根本意义。领导干部必须反覆教育全体职工，充分认识清理资产核定资金是为了更有效地发展我们的国家经济力量和国防力量，改善我们自己的生活。只有这样，才能得到全体职工的重视和支持。也只有这样，才能排除繁重复杂的困难，才能排除“生产太忙，办不起来”、“过去搞过两次清点，一阵风过去了，没有下文”的轻视态度和经验主义的错误看法。南京电业局职工的觉悟程度提高之后，发挥了高度的积极性，对清理资产核定资金工作的进展，起了决定的作用。如清点外线资产时，职工们响应工会号召，在暑天烈日下，不怕山高路远，逐杆清点；并且不断研究改进工作方法，及时交流经验；领导方面不断地表扬先进工作者。因此预计三百八十个工作组日的工作任务，二百二十个工作组日就突击完成了。又如在工会“节约反浪费”的号召之下，职工提出了若干利用旧废材料的课题，也有不少的成绩。
    清理资产核定资金还应和安全检查工作相结合。清理资产的范围广泛、全面，一切资产，角角落落都要一一查到，一一见面，无一遗漏。参加清点的人员也很多，以生产现场的主管人员、技术职员、技工们为清点骨干。而且，清理资产工作不仅要求有正确的数量的资料，也要求有精确的质量的资料。这样，就应当而且可以和电业生产中特别需要的安全检查相结合。这就和对一个人从历史到现状的健康大检查一样。这样，充分暴露出过去检修工作中看不到想不到的死角，就对今后机器设备的定期检修、日常维护和运转使用，提供了历史性的可靠的丰富的重要资料。其中有一部分，可以当时检修解决。如发电厂内某号循环水泵马达通风情况很坏，马达线圈槽沟容易进油；某处冷却水管有损漏现象，都被清点人员一一发现。发电厂就迅速进行检修，提高了这项设备的安全使用效力。在供电部门，找出瓷碍子破损、帮线松弛、杆木不良等隐形事故三百零五件，经分别缓急加以检修，因而消灭了一部分可能发生的线路事故。
    清理资产核定资金工作，还应和节约反浪费运动的准备工作相结合。经过全面的清理资产工作，很显然地暴露了我局过去有严重的浪费现象。据初步统计，仅库存器材一项，积压器材数值达百分之六十六。稍经加工修理后价值二千多万元的矽钢片，竟放置在废料堆里，无人过问。发电厂里有一座小型办公楼房，是解放后用账外材料（大部分是应退未退材料）建造的。这许多触目惊心的具体事实，就可以促使全局职工认识到我们过去对人民财产不关心，“只顾生产不管经营”的错误思想，已达到多么严重的程度。在清理资产核定资金后，节约器材、开动脑筋、利用旧废材料，已开始为全体职工所重视。如去年十一月中，供电工人主动把十几根多年来放置在废料中折断的旧钢杆加以焊接修补，变成完整可用的好钢杆。仓库工人从废旧铜线堆里，清理并焊接了可用的裸铜线二吨多，又清理出风雨线一千六百公尺。这些事实可以说明，在清理资产时，领导干部应注意搜集有关浪费的资料，分析造成浪费的原因，那些是盲目积压造成的，那些是材料预算不确造成的，那些是计划工作不慎造成的，那些是保管制度不良造成的，那些是工作责任性不强造成的。这样，就给即将进行的节约运动，提供了许多具体资料，并且打下了思想基础。
