Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch: The Soviet Union's proposals in the United Nations for eliminating the threat of war and consolidating international peace have received widespread reactions and exerted immense influence during the discussions in the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee.

When the UN General Assembly's Political Committee began discussing the Soviet peace proposals on the 12th, Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, spoke first. His speech was given great importance by all parties. Long before he spoke, all the spectator seats and press seats in the venue were already packed. During his speech, journalists frequently left the venue to telegraph excerpts of his speech. Delegations from various countries quickly telegraphed Vyshinsky's speech to their respective capitals, requesting instructions from their governments.

In this speech, Vyshinsky put forward specific proposals to condemn the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, stop the Korean War, ban atomic weapons, reduce armaments, and conclude a peace pact among the five major powers. Particularly on the issue of banning atomic weapons, reducing armaments, and establishing international supervision, Vyshinsky put forward new supplementary and revised proposals, removing the excuses used by the United States, Britain, and France in consistently rejecting Soviet proposals on this issue. These Soviet proposals not only encouraged people all over the world who are fighting for peace, but also pointed out a way out for the countries of the North Atlantic Group that are gasping under the burden of expanding armaments and preparing for war. In the United Nations, according to a Reuter's Paris dispatch on the 14th, the Soviet Union's new proposal on disarmament has become "the most important event" in this session of the General Assembly, "This new proposal has aroused the hope of many delegations for the possibility of reaching an agreement on the issues of banning atomic bombs, reducing armaments, and peace." The Paris edition of the "Daily Mail" said on the 14th: "Most representatives in the United Nations believe that Vyshinsky's proposal is a big step forward." The French "Franc-Tireur" said: The new Soviet proposal "has aroused a favorable reaction in some Arab and Asian groups of countries." The British "Times" also said: "This proposal is clearly attractive to world public opinion." Under such circumstances, even an Associated Press Paris dispatch on the 14th had to admit: "High-ranking officials feel that Russian diplomats have won a propaganda victory, and the West must be extremely careful and cautious when fighting back."

Such a widespread reaction to the Soviet proposals greatly alarmed the American delegation, which had suffered repeated defeats in this session of the General Assembly. Representatives from the United States, Britain, and France hurriedly held meetings to discuss "countermeasures." They dared not directly reject the Soviet proposals on banning atomic weapons and reducing armaments, and had to request that this proposal be handed over to the Disarmament Commission, attempting to bury this extremely important Soviet proposal. Although the United States forcibly made the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee accept its unreasonable demands on the 17th, it could not but do so at the cost of its serious political and moral losses. Even the French "Franc-Tireur," a pro-American newspaper, said: "Simply requesting that this (Soviet) proposal be submitted to the Disarmament Commission... makes people have some doubts about the true intentions of the Westerners." Moreover, when the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee voted on other proposals in the Soviet proposal, it showed that a considerable number of delegations refused to support the United States' position. Although the United States manipulated the majority to veto the Soviet proposals on condemning the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, stopping the Korean War, and concluding a peace pact among the five major powers, in the item-by-item voting, twelve to twenty-four delegations did not support the attitude of the United States' camp. The discussion of the Soviet peace proposals by the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee clearly reflects the important trend in the current international situation: the head of aggression, the United States, is becoming increasingly isolated, while the influence of the standard-bearer of peace, the Soviet Union, is expanding day by day.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch: According to a TASS Paris dispatch: At the meetings of the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee on the 15th, 16th, and 17th, it continued to discuss the "measures to eliminate the threat of another world war and consolidate international peace and friendship" proposed by the Soviet delegation on the 12th. The 17th meeting concluded the discussion of the Soviet proposal and voted on it.

The Soviet proposal included eight suggestions, the main points of which are: demanding that declaring participation in the North Atlantic Group and the establishment of military bases on foreign territories are incompatible with the qualifications of a member of the United Nations; peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; announcing the prohibition of atomic weapons and establishing international supervision for the implementation of this ban; the five major powers reduce armaments and armed forces by one-third; and the five major powers conclude a peace pact.

The Political Committee's debate on the Soviet proposal for several days vividly reflected two different political lines: on the one hand, the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union is striving to truly eliminate international tensions, and on the other hand, the United States and the countries attached to the United States are implementing a policy of preparing for war. The representatives of the countries of the US-British group, which formed the aggressive core in the United Nations, had attempted to obstruct the discussion of this Soviet proposal, but failed. Therefore, they tried their best at the meeting to avoid discussing the substance of the Soviet proposal. Their strategy was: to put forward unreasonable arguments and refuse to accept part of the Soviet proposal, namely: the first item on declaring participation in the North Atlantic Group incompatible with the qualifications of a member of the United Nations, the second item on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and the eighth item on the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers; for the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh items on banning atomic weapons, reducing the armaments and armed forces of the five major powers, and establishing strict international supervision for the implementation of these measures, they dared not openly oppose them, therefore, they put forward a joint proposal requesting that these suggestions not be discussed in the Political Committee, but be submitted to the Disarmament Commission for discussion, attempting in this way to delay the discussion of these extremely important issues in the Soviet proposal, and to bury the Soviet suggestions.

The delegations of many countries in the Political Committee expressed their unwillingness to support the US plot against the Soviet proposal. Particularly noteworthy was the speech by Egyptian representative Fawzi. He said: The Soviet proposal involves broad issues related to guaranteeing peace, and raises many issues that are indeed very important. He pointed out: Not many days ago, the head of the Egyptian delegation, Egyptian Foreign Minister Salah ad-Din, had sharply criticized the British-American-French plan to establish the so-called "Middle East Command," accusing this plan of attempting to confront Egypt and other Near Eastern countries with a fait accompli, and attempting to establish a so-called "sphere of influence" in the Near East regardless of the will of the people of the Near East. Fawzi said: Egypt will never agree to this. He expressed support for the Soviet proposal emphasizing that the establishment of bases on foreign territories is incompatible with the qualifications of a member of the United Nations, saying: Our attitude on this issue is very clear. Egypt particularly cannot allow other countries to establish military bases by force on its territory without its consent, because this violates the United Nations Charter and arouses the anger of the Egyptian people. Fawzi also expressed support for the Soviet suggestion regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. He said: The reason why the Korean issue occurred is precisely because of the existence of foreign troops and foreign forces in Korea. Interference in the internal affairs of other countries has never produced any good results, but on the contrary, interference always leads to war. Fawzi also emphasized that the points in the Soviet proposal regarding the prohibition of atomic weapons, disarmament, and the establishment of supervision are extremely important. He also expressed support for the suggestion that the five major powers conclude a peace pact.

Ukrainian delegation head Baranovs'kyi, in his speech, emphatically pointed out the difference between the eight suggestions put forward by the Soviet Union this time and the Soviet Union's amendments to the US, British, and French proposal on "regulating, limiting, and evenly reducing all armed forces and all armaments". He pointed out that in order to remove obstacles to reaching an agreement, the Soviet Union has made concessions to the suggestions of several delegations. The delegations of the US-British group of countries stubbornly opposed declaring the prohibition of atomic weapons and establishing international supervision.

The Soviet proposal, stemming from a genuine desire to achieve peace, has even made a deep impression on some countries in the US-British group. For example, even the representative of Ecuador expressed his refusal to support the US opposition to the Soviet proposal.

The Indian representative said in his speech: This session of the United Nations General Assembly has achieved very little in taking constructive measures to eliminate international tensions, but when the Soviet Union proposed simultaneously banning atomic weapons and establishing international supervision, as well as allowing international control agencies to conduct long-term inspections, we saw a glimmer of hope. He said: The Indian delegation is deeply convinced that peace can only be achieved on the basis of an agreement among the major powers, and the purpose of the Soviet proposal is to expand the field of agreement.

At the meeting on the 17th, Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky delivered a speech to the representatives of various countries, journalists, and audience members in the packed conference hall, summarizing the results of the discussion. He pointed out that the speeches of the representatives of the countries in the US camp all showed that they had colluded in advance not to discuss the substance of the Soviet proposal. The despicable anti-Soviet slander speeches they delivered were clearly intended to muddy the waters—because it is easier to fish in troubled waters—in order to make it impossible for the Political Committee to smoothly discuss basic and important issues, and at the same time to conceal their refusal to accept the Soviet proposal, which truly aimed at eliminating international tensions and ensuring peace.

After Vyshinsky's speech, the Political Committee began voting. The US delegation forced the committee to first vote on the joint proposal of the US, Britain, and France to submit the third to seventh items of the Soviet proposal to the Disarmament Commission for discussion, and forced the Political Committee to pass this joint proposal. When voting on the first, second, and eighth items of the Soviet proposal, many countries refused to follow the US opposition to the Soviet suggestions. Especially when voting on the eighth suggestion on concluding a peace pact among the five major powers, the United States barely scraped together thirty-five votes, just enough to reach the majority of votes necessary to veto the Soviet suggestion. It is worth noting that the delegations of eleven countries (including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, and Syria) voted in favor of the Soviet suggestion to conclude a peace pact among the five major powers; the delegations of thirteen countries: Ecuador, Abyssinia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Uruguay, Argentina, Honduras, Liberia, Pakistan, and Mexico abstained when voting on this suggestion.

### 苏联和平建议发生极大影响  鼓舞了世界和平运动迫使美国日益孤立  美国不敢公开反对竟强使联大政委会拒绝一部分苏联建议

    苏联和平建议发生极大影响
    鼓舞了世界和平运动迫使美国日益孤立
    美国不敢公开反对竟强使联大政委会拒绝一部分苏联建议
    【新华社二十日讯】苏联在联合国中提出的消除战争威胁与巩固国际和平的建议，在联合国大会政治委员会讨论过程中获得了广泛的反应，并产生了极大的影响。
    当联合国大会政治委员会在十二日开始讨论苏联的和平建议时，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基首先发言。他的发言受到各方的极大重视。在他发言以前很久，会场所有旁听席和记者席就已经挤满了。在他发言时，新闻记者们不时离开会场，把他的发言摘成电讯发出去。各国代表团都迅速把维辛斯基的发言电告本国首都，请求本国政府给予训令。
    维辛斯基在这个发言中，提出了谴责北大西洋侵略集团、停止朝鲜战争、禁止原子武器、裁减军备以及五大国缔结和平公约的具体建议。特别在禁止原子武器、裁减军备并建立国际监督问题上，维辛斯基提出了新的补充和修正建议，解除了美、英、法三国在一贯拒绝苏联关于这个问题的建议时所持的藉口。苏联这些建议不但鼓舞了全世界为和平而斗争的人民，而且也给在扩军备战重担下喘息的北大西洋集团各国指出了出路。在联合国中，据电通社巴黎十四日电报道：苏联关于裁减军备的新建议成为这届大会中“最重要的事件”，“这个新建议引起了许多代表团对于在禁止原子弹、裁减军备及和平问题上可能获致协议的希望”。巴黎版“每日邮报”十四日说：“联合国中的大多数代表都认为维辛斯基的建议是大大地向前走了一步。”法国“义勇军报”说：苏联的新建议“在一些阿拉伯和亚洲集团国家中引起有利的反应”。英国“泰晤士报”也说：“这个建议显然对世界舆论具有吸引力”。在这种情况下，甚至美联社巴黎十四日电都不得不承认：“高级方面觉得，俄国外交家已获得宣传上的胜利，西方还击时必须极其小心和慎重。”
    对于苏联建议这样广泛的反应，使得在这届大会中连遭失败的美国代表团大为恐慌。美、英、法三国代表团匆匆举行会议，商讨“对策”。它们不敢正面拒绝苏联关于禁止原子武器和裁减军备的建议，只得要求把这个建议交给裁减军备委员会，企图借此埋葬掉苏联这个极其重要的建议。最后美国虽然在十七日强使联合国大会政治委员会接受了它的无理要求，但是却不能不以它在政治上和道义上的严重损失作为代价。甚至法国“义勇军报”这样亲美的报纸也说：“只是要求把（苏联）这个建议提交裁减军备委员会，……使人对西方人士的真正意图发生某种怀疑。”而在联合国大会政治委员会表决苏联提案中的其他各项建议时，更表明有相当数目的代表团拒绝支持美国的立场。虽然美国操纵多数否决了苏联关于谴责北大西洋侵略集团、停止朝鲜战争以及缔结五大国和平公约的建议，但是在逐项表决中，有十二个到二十四个代表团不支持美国阵营的态度。联合国大会政治委员会关于苏联和平建议的讨论，清楚地反映出当前的国际形势中的重要趋向：侵略魁首美国正日益孤立，而和平旗手苏联的影响正日益扩大。
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会政治委员会在十五日、十六日和十七日的会议上，继续讨论苏联代表团在十二日所提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施”提案。十七日会议已结束了对苏联提案的讨论，并对它进行了表决。
    苏联提案包括八项建议，其要点为：要求宣告参加北大西洋集团及在外国领土上建立军事基地是和联合国会员国的资格不相容的；和平解决朝鲜问题；宣布禁止原子武器和对这个禁令的执行建立国际监督；五大国裁减军备和武装部队三分之一；缔结五大国和平公约。
    政治委员会连日对于苏联提案的辩论，鲜明地反映出了两条不同的政治路线：一方面是以苏联为首的民主阵营为真正消除国际紧张局势而努力，一方面是美国和依附美国的国家正在执行准备战争的政策。在联合国中形成侵略核心的美英集团国家的代表们，曾经企图阻挠讨论苏联这个提案，但是没有成功。因此，他们在会上就竭力企图避免讨论苏联提案的实质。他们的策略是：提出无理的论据，拒绝接受苏联提案的一部分，即：关于宣告参加北大西洋集团是与联合国会员国的资格不相容的第一项，关于和平解决朝鲜问题的第二项以及关于缔结五大国和平公约的第八项；对于关于禁止原子武器、裁减五大国的军备和武装部队，以及对这些措施之实行建立严格的国际监督的第三、四、五、六、七各项，他们不敢公开表示反对，因此，就提出了
    一个联合提案，要求不在政治委员会中讨论这些建议，而把它们提交裁减军备委员会讨论，企图这样来延宕讨论苏联提案中这些极端重要的问题，并且把苏联的建议埋葬掉。
    政治委员会中许多国家的代表团都表示不愿支持美国反对苏联提案的阴谋。特别值得注意的是埃及代表法齐的发言。他说：苏联的建议涉及有关保障和平的广泛问题，其中提出了许多确实甚为重要的问题。他指出：没有几天以前，埃及代表团团长、埃及外交大臣赛拉哈丁曾经尖锐地抨击建立所谓
    “中东司令部”的英美法计划，斥责这个计划企图使埃及和其他近东国家面对既成事实，并且企图不顾近东人民的意志在近东建立所谓“势力区”。法齐说：埃及永远不会对此表示同意。他表示支持苏联提案中强调在外国领土上建立基地与联合国会员国的资格不相容的建议，他说：我们在这个问题上的态度是很明确的。埃及特别不能允许其他国家没有得到它的同意就以武力在它的领土上建立军事基地，因为这违背联合国宪章并引起埃及人民的愤怒。法齐也表示支持苏联建议中关于一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的建议。他说：朝鲜问题之所以发生，正是因为朝鲜境内存在着外国军队和外国势力所致。干涉他国内政从来就不曾产生过什么好的结果，而是恰恰相反，干涉总是会引起战争的。法齐并强调苏联建议中关于禁止原子武器、裁减军备和建立监督的几点是极其重要的。他也表示支持五大国缔结和平公约的建议。
    乌克兰代表团团长巴拉诺夫斯基在发言中着重指出了苏联这次所提出的八项建议与苏联对美英法三国的“规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切武装部队和一切军备”提案所提出的修正案的区别。他指出：为了要除去妨碍达成协议的障碍，苏联已对若干代表团的建议作了让步。美英集团国家的代表团仍旧顽固地反对宣布禁止原子武器和建立国际监督。
    从真正获致和平的愿望出发的苏联提案，甚至使美英集团的一些国家也得到了深刻的印象。例如，连厄瓜多尔的代表也表示拒绝支持美国反对苏联提案的意见。
    印度代表发言说：联合国本届大会在为消除国际紧张局势而采取的建设性措施上，成就很少，但是，当苏联提出同时禁止原子武器并建立国际监督，以及国际管制机构得以长期进行视察的建议时，我们看到了一线希望的曙光。他说：印度代表团深信，只有在大国取得协议的基础上，才能获得和平，而苏联建议的目的在于扩大协议的领域。
    在十七日的会议上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在会议厅中坐得满满的各国代表、新闻记者和旁听群众面前发表演说，总结了讨论的结果。他指出：美国阵营的各国代表的发言，在在都说明了他们事先就串通好了不想讨论苏联提案的实质。他们所发表的卑鄙的反苏诽谤演说，显然是为了把水搅混——因为在混水中摸鱼比较容易一点——，以便使得政治委员会无法顺利地讨论基本的重要问题，同时这也是为了掩饰他们拒绝接受真正以消除国际紧张局势和确保和平为目的的苏联提案。
    维辛斯基发言以后，政治委员会即开始进行表决。美国代表团强使委员会先表决了美英法三国要求把苏联提案中第三至第七项提交裁减军备委员会讨论的联合提案，并且强使政治委员会通过了这个联合提案。在就苏联提案中的第一、第二和第八项进行表决时，许多国家拒绝追随美国反对苏联建议。特别是在表决关于缔结五大国和平公约的第八项建议时，美国好容易才凑足了三十五票，刚刚够否决苏联建议所必需的过半数票。值得注意的是：十一个国家（其中包括苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、埃及、缅甸、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚）的代表团投票赞成苏联所提缔结五大国和平公约的这个建议；十三个国家：厄瓜多尔、阿比西尼亚、印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、乌拉圭、阿根廷、洪都拉斯、利比里亚、巴基斯坦和墨西哥的代表团在表决这项建议时弃权。
