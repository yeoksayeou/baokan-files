Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 1st: All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army sent a telegram to General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and all commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army on New Year's Day to congratulate them on the New Year. The telegram reads as follows:

To General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and all commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army Comrades:

On the occasion of the New Year of 1952, we would like to extend our warm and heartfelt congratulations to you.

Over the past year, the heroic Korean people and their army, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, have achieved great victories in the just struggle against the aggression of British and American imperialism to defend the independence, freedom, and honor of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and have made brilliant contributions to the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world sincerely admire the great achievements made by the Korean people in the struggle against the common enemy of the world's people.

In order to support the just struggle of the Korean people and to crush the conspiracy of American imperialism to invade China and undermine peace in the Far East, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea and fought side by side with the Korean People's Army. Over the past fourteen months, the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, which has a long history, has been greatly developed and consolidated in the battle to strike down the common enemy. The friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples has become an invincible force.

Under the severe blows of the Chinese and Korean peoples, the evil plan of American imperialism to destroy Korea and then attack China has been completely defeated. However, American imperialism is not reconciled to defeat. It continues to delay and obstruct the progress of the armistice negotiations, and attempts to achieve its arrogant goal of interfering in the internal affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the negotiating table. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army will continue to stand closely with the Korean people, give the aggressors and the Syngman Rhee henchmen even more severe blows, and fight to the end for the victorious conclusion of the anti-aggression war, and will never stop until our goal is achieved.

Long live the brotherly fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, and between the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army!

Respectfully,
All Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
January 1, 1952

    我志愿军全体指战员
    电金日成将军和人民军祝贺新年
    【新华社朝鲜前线一日电】中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员在元旦日致电朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和人民军全体指挥员、战斗员祝贺新年。电文如下：
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军并人民军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    值兹一九五二年元旦，我们谨向你们表示热烈的衷心的祝贺。
    一年多来，英勇的朝鲜人民及其军队在金日成将军的领导下，在反抗美英帝国主义侵略保卫朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立、自由和荣誉的正义斗争中，取得了伟大的胜利，为保卫远东和世界和平的事业作了光辉的贡献。中国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民，衷心敬仰朝鲜人民在反抗世界人民共同的敌人的斗争中所建立的巨大功勋。
    中国人民志愿军为了支援朝鲜人民的正义斗争，和粉碎美帝国主义侵略中国、破坏远东和平的阴谋，进入朝鲜，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，十四个月来，中朝两国人民有悠久历史的兄弟般的友谊已在打击共同敌人的战斗中得到了极大的发展和巩固。中朝两国人民的友谊和团结已成为不可战胜的力量。
    在中朝两国人民的严重打击下，美帝国主义灭亡朝鲜并进而进攻中国的罪恶计划已遭到彻底的失败。但美帝国主义是不甘心失败的，它仍旧不断地在拖延和阻挠停战谈判的进行，并企图在会议桌上达到它干涉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内政的狂妄目的。中国人民志愿军将继续和朝鲜人民紧紧地站在一起，予侵略者及李承晚帮凶以更严重的打击，为争取反侵略战争的胜利结束而奋斗到底，不达目的誓不休止。
    中朝两国人民、中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军兄弟般的战斗友谊万岁！
    中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员谨上
                    一九五二年元旦
