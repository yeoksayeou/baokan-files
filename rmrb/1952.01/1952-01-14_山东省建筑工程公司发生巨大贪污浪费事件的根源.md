The Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company has experienced significant corruption and dereliction of duty, resulting in enormous losses of state property. One of the key reasons for these incidents is the serious bureaucratic work style of leading cadres.

The company's General Manager, Dai Qihua, even entrusted his private seal to the mail clerk for safekeeping, a practice that had persisted for nearly a year. Within the headquarters of the general company, over 162 million yuan was overspent on ten expense items from January to September of 1951. Every payment voucher was stamped with Dai Qihua's seal, yet he remained completely unaware of all the expenses. The finance department neither controlled the payment of funds at each level based on needs beforehand, nor audited them level by level afterward. They would make payments as long as the General Manager's seal was affixed, taking responsibility only for the seal, not for the system or the state. Ordinary construction sites did not even have accounting personnel. The funds needed for the sites were directly given to construction workers for payment, with reimbursements based on receipts. Whether the usage was reasonable or not was impossible to audit, creating loopholes for embezzlement and private gain. Regarding payments for purchased materials, the finance department would only make payments based on temporary receipts from the materials department. The purchasing contracts were kept in the materials department, so the finance department had no way of knowing the quantity of materials purchased. Thus, under the company's policy of "making money from materials," the materials department hoarded large quantities of materials, leading to poor capital turnover. There was never a strict auditing system for rework waste, penalty payments (such as late pickup penalties at railway stations, project delay penalties, and penalties for violating construction regulations), material losses, or material overspending. As long as the leadership approved, items could be claimed or reimbursed. Responsibility was never clearly assigned, and no punishment or orders for compensation were ever imposed on those who made mistakes. As a result, errors occurred repeatedly.

The vast majority of the company's personnel were recruited. For technical personnel, it was said to be "hire first, then review"; in reality, due to the leadership's blind worship of technical personnel and one-sided belief in them, no review or ideological remolding was conducted after hiring. Therefore, unqualified individuals could not be discovered in time, and truly skilled and capable personnel could not fully utilize their abilities, allowing bad elements to take the opportunity to infiltrate the company. For example, Zhang Yifan, the chief of the design section, was a counter-revolutionary element dispatched to the mainland by a Taiwanese spy organization. Ma Peng, a staff member of the planning section, was the director of the Licheng Prison in Shandong Province during the enemy-puppet regime and had consistently been an enemy of the people. Accountant Liu Piwen had participated in the reactionary "Homecoming Corps," engaged in "reverse accounting" against farmers, and killed four of our village cadres and activists.

The company's leading cadres did not follow organizational procedures but instead relied on personal relationships to bring in "old subordinates" and promote them casually. Some people, after being promoted, were unable to competently perform their duties, causing dissatisfaction and disunity among cadres. More than 30 cadres were placed in the company without going through formal organizational procedures. Deputy General Manager Li Nianzhen openly placed the counter-revolutionary element Xiao Zhongping as a warehouse keeper. (During the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Xiao was sentenced to death by the people's government according to law.)

The general company had a total of three general managers and deputy general managers (besides Dai and Li, another deputy general manager was Zhang Guishi). They were "busy" every day and rarely went to the office. Over the year, they had never attended any meetings held by the various sections. The secretary's office, which was directly under the General Manager, had not held a single office meeting in the past year. Consequently, the bureaucratic work style in the sections was also developing. For example, after the construction section contracted for the Bethune Hospital project, it immediately prepared a budget for the required timber based on needs and submitted it to the materials section for allocation. The materials section simply forwarded this form to its own woodworking factory for processing. During the processing period, the construction section did not conduct any on-site inspections of the materials section's allocation. The materials section did the same for the woodworking factory. When the processed timber was transported to the construction site, it was only then discovered during construction that it did not meet specifications, and workers were forced to cut large pieces into smaller ones, resulting in a loss of 3 million yuan in timber costs. Due to work stoppages waiting for materials and fear that the project could not be completed on time, construction was rushed, resulting in poor construction, dissatisfaction from the client, and rework, wasting another 7.2 million yuan.

In 1950, the Shandong Construction Engineering Company experienced 52 construction accidents, accounting for over 30% of the total contracted projects. The crux of the problem was that the company lacked a management system, cost accounting, and construction plans. The general company's design section always sat in the office designing and drawing blueprints, never conducting actual on-site surveys. They even designed a room for the woodworking factory to decorate a transformer without the design engineer stepping out of the office. After the blueprints were completed, when the construction section started work, they discovered that the "flat ground" on the drawing was actually a swampy area of the woodworking factory. As a result, piles had to be driven and soil filled in, resulting in a great waste of timber and labor. How much was wasted has not been calculated to this day. The design section not only did not conduct on-site surveys beforehand but also never went to the construction site during construction, nor did they conduct on-site inspections of the designs they had created. As a result, the construction section could not effectively solve problems that arose during construction or improper design, sometimes modifying the drawings without authorization or simply letting errors stand. For example, when contracting for the salt company's warehouse project, the foundation was poor and needed to be reinforced. However, there was no design or budget for this in the drawings, so there was no foundation reinforcement. After the project was completed and salt was loaded into the warehouse, the foundation soon sank by about one foot, the roof columns dropped, and the walls cracked and pillars skewed, rendering it unusable. It had to be renovated at a cost of over 1 billion yuan. Not long ago, they wasted more than 2.7 billion yuan on a project they contracted. Deputy General Manager Li Nianzhen retorted, "In terms of quotas, we wasted more than 2.7 billion yuan, but in reality, our company still made more than 200 million yuan." This shows that they had no overall concept or national concept and only cared about making money for their small unit.

Another very important reason for the occurrence of massive corruption and dereliction of duty incidents is that the leading cadres of the Shandong Construction Engineering Company lacked a democratic work style and criticism and self-criticism. Therefore, problems that were originally not big gradually developed into serious problems that were beyond repair.

The phenomenon of corruption and rework waste by company staff was discovered as early as 1950. Many comrades actively proposed handling this issue. Both the People's Daily and the Dazhong Daily criticized the company's corruption and waste. However, the company's leading comrades never humbly accepted these criticisms and suggestions. Instead, they adopted improper means to attack comrades who made suggestions and resisted newspaper criticism. For example, when they sent Chi Qi, Wang Xilian, and Han Mingqi to the Northeast to purchase timber in July 1950, many comrades in the company disagreed with this decision, on the grounds that Chi Qi had lent 10 million yuan of public funds to his mistress for business when he worked at the Sheng Sheng Flour Mill in the Industrial Bureau. However, the general managers and deputy general managers believed that "Chi Qi is a cadre from the Industrial Bureau; we put in a lot of effort to get this cadre, and we should give him important tasks." They not only did not accept everyone's opinions but also planned to promote Chi Qi to deputy section chief of the materials section. Another example is the incident in which Dong Bochuan defrauded the company of 600 million yuan in public funds. Initially, some people expressed disagreement with paying such a large sum of money in advance. Later, after the problem had already occurred, Dai Qihua still said, "Don't worry about it, I'll take responsibility." Many people proposed several opinions about the corruption of other engineering personnel and purchasing personnel, the company's rework waste, business policies, and personnel system, but none of them was adopted. Once, the company's secretary, Zhu Qing, had a heart-to-heart talk with Dai Qihua, and Dai Qihua said to Zhu Qing, "If everyone has any opinions about me, please tell me. This is helping me, and I very much welcome your opinions." Zhu Qing very sincerely told him the opinions he had thought of and heard. The main point was that Dai Qihua had a bureaucratic work style and could not humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. After Dai heard this, he not only did not examine himself but said angrily, "I, Lao Dai, have participated in the revolution for more than 20 years, and I have never heard that I have bureaucracy or lack of humility! What a coincidence today!" As a result, they parted unhappily.

Dai Qihua and others not only did not humbly accept the correct criticisms and suggestions from comrades below but also carried out attacks and retaliation against those who made criticisms and suggestions. Comrade Zhu Qing (disabled soldier, Communist Party member) had been feeling that there were many problems in the company that needed to be corrected since he was transferred to work at this company in 1950. However, he made several suggestions to Dai Qihua and others, but there was no result. Later, seeing that the problem was getting more and more serious, he discussed with Zang Yifu, deputy section chief of the company's finance section, and Sun Dawen, staff member of the personnel section, about writing a critical article and sending it to the Dazhong Daily, which was published in the Dazhong Daily under the pseudonyms of the three of them. After seeing this critical article, Dai Qihua and Li Nianzhen were shouting and yelling in the office. Dai said, "Who did this? Playing the piano randomly! This is really unorganized and undisciplined! I must find out who wrote this article!" He held the newspaper and shouted everywhere to find the person who wrote the article. Li Nianzhen said, "In the future, whoever writes an article should also have their photo published." Many people in the company expressed dissatisfaction with Dai and Li's actions. Comrades Wang Feng, Wang Zhen, Lu Zheng, Liu Yusheng, and Song Renjiang jointly wrote a letter to Dai Qihua, criticizing this attitude of suppressing criticism and demanding that Dai, Li, and others study Comrade Stalin's "On Criticism and Self-Criticism" and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications." Comrade Zhu Qing did not retreat either. He thought that he was a Communist Party member and could never watch the people's cause suffer losses. He continued to write to the newspaper and the Shandong Provincial People's Procuratorate about the facts of corruption and waste in the company. In December 1950, Dai Qihua went to the Industrial Bureau to request the transfer of Zhu Qing's work. The reason was that "Zhu Qing has no work to do now and there is no benefit in the company." In fact, Zhu Qing's work was very busy, and sometimes he even worked overtime at night. However, Dai Qihua actually deleted Zhu Qing's name from the staffing list without authorization. This matter was opposed by many comrades. Everyone discussed and asked, "Why transfer Zhu Qing's work?" "Do you transfer work because you make too many suggestions?" Later, the order to transfer Zhu Qing's work was issued, but because the masses were dissatisfied, and the annual work summary for 1950 had to be done by Zhu Qing (he had all the materials), Zhu Qing was not transferred. However, Dai Qihua turned around and scolded the Industrial Bureau in front of Zhu Qing, saying that the Industrial Bureau did not go through him to transfer cadres. Under these circumstances, many cadres in the company did not dare to make suggestions openly, and they did not speak out when they saw corruption and waste. Their attitude was "Make fewer suggestions to avoid trouble."

The leading comrades of the Industrial Bureau of the Shandong Provincial People's Government also lacked the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. The three general managers of this company were not united with each other and competed in extravagance and waste. Feng Ping, director of the Industrial Bureau, and Wang Jiwu, deputy director, knew about this situation, but they not only did not criticize the responsible cadres of the company, but sometimes also suppressed the opinions raised by the lower-level cadres of the company. A cadre once wrote a letter to Feng Ping to tell him about the problems in the company; Feng did not deal with it but instead asked at the company's staff meeting who wrote the letter. And he said, "We must look at the problem comprehensively. The achievements since the company was established are very great," etc., to cover up and dilute the problems in the company.

The problem is very clear. If the leading comrades of the Shandong Construction Engineering Company had a democratic work style and could humbly accept the criticisms and suggestions of the masses, many of the serious losses caused to the country and the people could have been avoided.

    山东省建筑工程公司发生巨大贪污浪费事件的根源
    石铭  朱波
    山东省建筑工程公司发生巨大的贪污渎职事件，使国家财产遭受巨大的损失。发生事件的重要的原因之一，是领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风。
    公司总经理戴启华，连自己的私人图章都不愿管，而交给收发同志代管。这种情形已近一年了。总公司本机关内，一九五一年度一月份到九月份十项开支，共计超支了一亿六千二百多万元。每一张支付的单据上都盖有戴启华的图章，但他对于所有开支却全然不知。对于机关费用，财务部门事先既不根据需要逐级控制款项的支付，事后也不逐级审核。他们见总经理盖了章就付款，只对图章负责任，对制度、对国家是不负责任的。一般的工地，连会计人员都没有。工地所需款项，都是直接交给施工人员支付，凭单据报销。用途是不是合理，根本没法审核。因此给大量挪用公款、营私舞弊造成空隙。关于采购材料的款项，财务科只凭材料科暂领条子付款。采购的合同存在材料科，财务科对所购材料的数量没法知道。材料科就在公司“材料赚钱”的方针下大量囤积材料，以致资金周转不灵。返工浪费、罚金支出（如在铁路车站上提货误时罚款、工程逾期罚款、违犯建筑规章罚款等）、材料损耗、材料超支等等，从来没有严格的审核制度；只要领导人批准，就可以领用或报销。从来没有分清责任，对犯错误的人员实行过处分或责令赔偿。因此，错误层出不穷。
    公司绝大部分的人员，是招聘来的。对于技术人员，说是“先录用后审查”；实际上，由于领导人盲目崇拜技术人员，片面相信技术人员，录用后也没有进行任何审查和教育改造。所以，滥竽充数的分子不能及时发现，真正有技术有能力的人员也不能充分发挥能力，并使坏分子乘机潜伏到公司里来。如设计科科长张逸凡，就是台湾特务组织派遣到大陆来的反革命分子。计划科科员马朋，是敌伪时期山东省历城监狱的看守主任，一贯与人民为敌。会计刘丕文，曾参加反动的“还乡团”，向农民实行过“倒算”，杀害过我们的村干部和积极分子四人。
    公司领导干部不按照组织手续办事，而是通过私人关系拉“老部下”，并轻易提拔。有些人被提拔起来以后，对工作不能胜任，又造成干部间的互相不服气和不团结。公司里没有经过正式组织手续而安插的干部，共有三十多人。副总经理李念珍公然安插了反革命分子萧仲平当保管员。（在大张旗鼓镇压反革命中，萧犯已为人民政府依法判处死刑。）
    总公司正副总经理共三人（除戴、李外，另一个副总经理是张贵时）。他们天天“忙”，办公室都很少去。一年来他们从没有参加过各个科里召开的会议，总经理直属的秘书室，一年来还没开过一次室务会。因之科里的官僚主义作风也在发展。比如施工科在承包了白求恩医院的工程后，当即按照所需木料，做出预算表交给材料科配料。材料科就把这个表照转给自己的木工厂加工。在加工期间，施工科对材料科配料进行的情形一直没实地检查过。材料科对于木工厂也是如此。加工后的木料运到了工地，到施工时才发现不合规格，只好临时迫令木工由大改小；这样就损失了木料费三百万元。由于停工待料，怕工程到期不能完成，就急急赶工，因而施工不周，委托者不满，再度返工，又浪费了七百二十多万元。
    一九五○年度山东建筑工程公司发生工程事故五十二处，占承包工程总数的百分之三十强。问题的症结，是公司在经营管理上没有制度，没有成本核算，没有施工计划。总公司的设计科一向都是坐在办公室里设计、绘图样，从来没有到工地实际进行过勘察。甚至给本公司木工厂设计装修变电器的房屋，设计工程师都不曾迈出办公室的大门。图样设计完毕，施工科动工时，才发现图上的“平地”原来是木工厂的一片水洼子。结果现打桩，现填土，木材人工浪费很大。到底浪费了多少，至今没有算出来。设计科不仅事先不做实地勘察，施工中也从没有到过工地，对自己所设计的图样也没有进行过实地检查。因之，施工科在施工中发生困难或图样设计不妥时，不能很好地解决，有时就擅自修改图样，有时就将错就错。如承包盐业公司的仓库工程时，因地基不好，需要垫基。但图样上并没有设计，没有这笔预算，就没有垫基。工程完毕，仓库装上了盐以后，不久地基沉陷了下去约一英尺，库房的顶柱也下坠，墙裂柱歪，不堪使用，必须翻修，需款十亿元以上。不久以前他们承包的一处工程，就浪费了二十七亿多元。公司副总经理李念珍反说：“从定额来说，我们是浪费了二十七亿多元，可是实际上我们公司还赚了两亿多元。”由此可见他们毫无整体观念和国家观念，只顾自己小单位赚钱。
    发生巨大贪污渎职事件的另一个很重要的原因，是山东建筑工程公司领导干部十分缺乏民主作风，十分缺乏批评和自我批评。因此，本来不大的问题，渐渐发展成了不堪收拾的严重问题。
    公司工作人员贪污和返工浪费的现象，早在一九五○年就发现了。对于这个问题，不少同志曾积极地提出处理意见。人民日报和大众日报也都批评过这个公司贪污浪费的现象。但是，公司的领导同志一直都没有虚心地接受这些批评和建议，反而采取不正派的手段打击提意见的同志，抗拒报纸的批评。如他们一九五○年七月派迟岐、王希连、韩鸣岐等人赴东北采购木材时，公司里很多同志就不同意这样做，理由是迟岐过去在工业厅生生面粉厂工作时，就曾把
    一千万元公款借给他的姘头做生意。但是正副总经理都认为“迟岐是工业厅的干部；我们费了很大力气才把这个干部要来，应该重用”。他们不但不接受大家的意见，并且打算把迟岐提升为材料科副科长。又如被董伯川骗去六亿元公款的事件，原先就有人表示不同意先付巨款。后来问题已经发生了，戴启华还是说：“你们不要管，由我负责。”其他工程人员、采购人员的贪污问题、公司的返工浪费、经营方针、人事制度等问题，都有人提出过不少的意见，但都没有被采纳。有一次，公司的秘书竹青和戴启华谈心，戴启华对竹青说：“大家对我有什么意见，请你谈谈，这是对我的帮助，我非常欢迎你们提意见。”竹青就很诚恳地把自己想到的和听到的意见谈了谈。主要是说戴启华有官僚主义作风，不能虚心听取群众的意见。戴听了以后，不仅不检讨自己，反而生气地说：“我老戴参加革命二十多年，还没有听说过我有官僚主义和不虚心呢！今天真巧！”结果是不欢而散。
    戴启华等不仅不虚心地接受下边同志的正确的批评和建议，而且对提出批评和建议的人实行打击和报复。竹青同志（残废军人，共产党员）在一九五○年调到这个公司工作以来，常感到公司有很多问题，需要纠正。但他向戴启华等提过数次，都没有结果。后来看到问题越来越严重，便和公司的财务科副科长臧亦夫、人事科干事孙大文等商量着写了一篇批评的稿件，寄给大众日报，以三个人的化名发表在大众日报上。戴启华、李念珍看到这篇批评的文章以后，便在办公室里大嚷大叫。戴说：“这是谁干的事？乱弹琴！真是无组织无纪律！我非把写稿的人找出来不可！”他拿着报纸到处吵嚷着要找写稿的人。李念珍说：“以后谁写稿子，应该把他的照片也登出来。”公司里很多人对戴、李这种举动表示不满。王峰、王真、路正、刘玉升、宋仁江等同志就联名写信给戴启华，对这种压制批评的态度提出批评，要求戴、李等好好学习学习斯大林同志的
    “论批评与自我批评”和中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”。竹青同志也没有退缩。他想到自己是共产党员，绝不能眼看着人民的事业遭受损失。他以后仍然不断地把公司内贪污、浪费的事实写给报社，写给山东省人民检察署。一九五零年十二月，戴启华曾到工业厅要求调动竹青的工作。理由是“竹青现在没有工作做，在公司里没有什么好处”。实际上，竹青的工作是很忙的，有时还在夜里加班。但戴启华竟在编制表里把竹青的名字擅自删去。这件事情受到很多同志反对。大家都议论纷纷地问：“为什么调动竹青的工作？”“提意见多了就调动工作吗？”后来调动竹青工作的命令发了下来，但因群众不满，并且一九五零年年终工作总结也非由竹青来做不可（他掌握着全部材料），这样才没有把竹青调走。但戴启华又当着竹青的面，反过来骂工业厅，说工业厅调动干部没有经过他。在这种情形下，公司里很多干部不敢正面提意见，看到贪污浪费现象也不说。他们的态度是“少提意见，免得出麻烦”。
    山东省人民政府工业厅的领导同志，也非常缺乏批评和自我批评的精神。这个公司的三个总经理互相间不团结，在铺张浪费上进行比赛。这种情形，工业厅厅长冯平和副厅长王纪武是知道的，但他们不仅没有对公司的负责干部进行过批评，而且有时对公司下层干部所提出的意见也实行压制。有一个干部曾把公司里的问题写信告诉冯平；冯不做处理，却在公司职工大会上追问那封信是谁写的。并且说“看问题要全面，公司成立以来成绩是很大的”等等，想掩盖和冲淡公司里的问题。
    问题很明显，如果山东省建筑工程公司的领导同志们有民主作风，能虚心地接受群众的批评和建议，给国家人民造成的严重损失有许多是可以避免的。
