    My Work Efficiency Significantly Improved After Learning Hao Jianxiu's Working Method

    Editor: I am a fine yarn spinning worker at the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. After learning Hao Jianxiu's working method and understanding its basic spirit, my work efficiency has significantly improved. In the past, I oversaw 600 spindles of 22-count yarn every day, and because my work lacked planning, I was exhausted and covered in sweat. My performance was very poor; I produced 0.504 pounds of roller waste every day, and I also discarded a lot of roving. After learning Hao Jianxiu's working method, I work easily and happily, and I can oversee 1,000 spindles every day, with roller waste reduced to only 0.29 pounds. I deeply feel that these achievements should be entirely attributed to Hao Jianxiu's working method.

    学习郝建秀工作法后我的工作效率显著提高了
    编辑同志：我是国营天津第一棉纺织厂细纱看车工人。我学会了郝建秀工作法，领会了它的基本精神，我的工作效率显著提高了。过去，我每天看二十二支纱六百锭，因为工作无计划，累得满头大汗，疲劳不堪。我的成绩很差，皮辊花每天要出零点五零四磅，粗纱也丢弃很多。我学会了郝建秀工作法后，工作得轻松愉快，每天可看一千锭子，皮辊花才只零点二九磅。我深深感到：这些成绩完全应归功于郝建秀工作法。  康德珍（郑恩龙代笔）
