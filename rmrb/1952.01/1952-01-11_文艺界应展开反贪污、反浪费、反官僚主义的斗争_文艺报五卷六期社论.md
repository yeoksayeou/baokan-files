The ongoing movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy throughout the country is an important step in promoting our national defense and economic construction, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, guiding our country towards prosperity and strength, and steadily moving towards socialism and communism. Our literary and art workers must deeply understand the significance and role of this movement and actively participate in it.

We must adopt a positive attitude towards this movement because it is a major political task for the Chinese people at present, and also because serious phenomena of corruption, extravagance and waste, and bureaucratic work styles still exist within our own ranks. These bad phenomena and work styles hinder the construction and progress of the country, and also hinder the development of the people's literary and art cause.

In certain corners of the literary and art circles, there are some intolerable phenomena:

Some leading comrades in some local literary and art organizations adopt an abominable bureaucratic attitude towards their work. They abandon ideological leadership, and therefore cannot solve problems in actual movements; they do not organize creation, study, and criticism activities; they are busy all day holding meetings that are unprepared and fruitless. When meetings are held, they replace serious research on problems with boundless empty talk, discussing without deciding, and deciding without acting. They put their interests in social activities of welcoming and sending off, eating their fill all day, doing nothing, and only focusing on pomp and circumstance. Under this kind of bureaucratic leadership, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste, disregarding the people's property, is bound to arise. For example, the Nanjing Federation of Literary and Art Circles spent nearly 3 billion yuan when building the "Nanjing Auditorium" and repairing the "Literary and Art Club."

The transfer of one staff member involved three farewell banquets, the cost of which was equivalent to ten months' contracted expenses for a district-level cadre. Furthermore, the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles sent out more than 400 pennants in one year alone. A symposium of correspondents held by a certain publication in Shanghai also cost more than 2 million yuan. What a shocking phenomenon this is!

Looking at creation: the abandonment or modification of only three films by the Film Bureau cost 5 billion yuan. Although this number is large, it can be checked. There are more wasteful phenomena that are not easily seen at a glance. For example, some writers create some crude and shoddy works, and there are many speculative publishers who annually swindle an unknown amount of wealth from the people and waste a lot of paper, while they repay the people with useless or even harmful reading materials. Some authors, blinded by profit, specialize in catering to these speculative publishers and become speculators themselves, but they are not ashamed of it at all. Some groups have established creative teams, but no good works have been produced in one or two years, and they show no sense of shame. Some meaningless or harmful old works have also begun to gradually fill the market. There are also some people who specialize in plagiarizing the works of others, and the editors seem to be working with their eyes closed, allowing the phenomenon of plagiarism to occur repeatedly without vigilance. … These wasteful and disguised forms of corruption are not easy to detect at once, but when these figures are added up, the number is very alarming.

In some local literary and art activities, there is also a phenomenon of extravagance and waste in pursuing formalism and focusing on pomp and circumstance. Some rural theater troupes have to spend dozens of piculs of rice to perform "big plays" that are not related to the realistic tasks of the time and place, which has gradually become a trend and is encouraged by the local literary and art leading organs. Some theater troupes perform repertoire with very problematic content, but they are very insensitive to this aspect, while they show their "genius" in spending money to purchase props and costumes.

The fact is obvious that the above-mentioned serious disguised forms of corruption and extravagance and waste are inseparable from the bureaucratic work style existing in the leadership of some of our literary and art organizations.

How can we tolerate all this? The people, especially the workers and peasants, work hard all day long to create wealth for the country, and some of our literary and art organizations and some literary and art workers not only waste the people's materials, energy, and time, but also poison the people ideologically. Is this not a despicable and shameful act? We must ruthlessly expose all similar phenomena and resolutely oppose them.

In our literary and art ranks, there are a large number of literary and art workers who are loyal to the revolutionary literary and art cause. They stand on the position of the working class, always adhere to Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and art policy, and serve the people diligently and honestly. They are respected and loved by the people. But those bureaucrats, those people who speculate for profit and engage in extravagance and waste, have nothing in common with these excellent literary and art workers. In order to strengthen the combat effectiveness of our ideological front and make the people's literary and art cause make more contributions to the country and the people, we must quickly and resolutely correct the serious shortcomings that exist in our ranks. If some literary and art organizations or these literary and art workers still do not correct their mistakes, they should, as Comrade Hu Qiaomu instructed at the mobilization meeting for rectification in the Beijing literary and art circles, be "declared dissolved" and these literary and art workers "be expelled by the literary and art organizations to which they belong."

To eradicate the bureaucratic habits and corruption and waste of literary and art organizations and literary and art workers, we must closely integrate the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy with the literary and art circles' rectification and study movement that is being carried out in some areas. The literary and art circles, like other business departments, have produced corruption, waste, and bureaucracy because we are ideologically attacked by bourgeois ideas. This decadent and corrupt bourgeois ideology makes some of us short-sighted, and besides our own immediate interests, we can no longer see anything more important, which will seriously hinder the improvement of our political character and lead us to lose our way forward. Some of us have not fundamentally transformed this bourgeois ideology brought from the old society, and some have undergone some transformation, but it is not thorough enough; therefore, when they enter the city and come into contact with bourgeois habits, they repeat the old tune. Some literary and art workers cannot establish and consolidate the idea of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers because this old ideology has not been transformed or has not been transformed thoroughly, or they just shout it in words and never think of implementing it in practice. Chairman Mao instructed us in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" that "the question of 'for whom?' is a fundamental question, a question of principle." And some of our literary and art workers have not yet truly understood this question. Just imagine: if running a publication is not for the masses, but only to vent one's emotions or express oneself, how can this publication not have waste products? If publishing works is only for royalties, to satisfy one's own vanity, and to seek fame and profit, how can one not deviate from life and produce crudely? If performing a play does not first consider the needs of the masses, but to satisfy one's own pursuit of formal requirements, how can one not be extravagant and wasteful? If the leaders of literary and art organizations do not take on the responsibility of ideological leadership and want to show themselves doing work in form, how can they not show their work achievements with extravagant pomp and circumstance and empty meetings? … All this shows that if any literary and art organization or any literary and art worker cannot implement the direction of worker-peasant-soldier literature and art instructed by Chairman Mao, they will inevitably make mistakes in their work or creation, and may also cause corruption and waste and bureaucracy. Therefore, we require literary and art workers to actively participate in this movement, combined with the literary and art rectification and study, to thoroughly eliminate the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie in terms of creative ideas, work, and lifestyle, with a two-pronged approach.

The unfolding of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, like the literary and art circles' rectification and study movement that is currently underway, is extremely important to our literary and art workers. In order to make our literary and artistic cause achieve greater development, and in order to make our literary and art work better become a "huge active force" to help form and consolidate the economic foundation, we must rectify our ranks and establish correct ideas and a simple and pragmatic work style. The corrupt habits of the bourgeoisie are incompatible with revolutionary literary and art work. Therefore, conducting the literary and art circles' rectification and study more deeply to rectify literary and art thought, and actively participating in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement are equally urgent political tasks for us at present.

    文艺界应展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争
    ——文艺报五卷六期社论
    目前正在全国各地展开的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，是推进我们国家的国防建设和经济建设，是巩固人民民主专政制度，引导我们国家走向繁荣昌盛，稳步走向社会主义和共产主义的一个重要步骤。我们文艺工作者必须深刻地认识这个运动的意义与作用，并应积极地参加这个运动。
    我们所以要以积极的态度对待这样一个运动，因为这是当前中国人民重大的政治任务，同时我们本身也还存在着严重的贪污、铺张浪费现象和官僚主义作风。这种恶劣的现象与作风妨碍着国家的建设与进步，同时也妨碍着人民文艺事业的发展。
    文艺界的某些角落存在着这样一些不可容忍的现象：
    有些地方文艺组织中的某些领导同志，对待自己的工作采取可恶的官僚主义态度。他们放弃思想领导，因而也不可能解决实际运动中的问题；不组织创作、学习和批评活动；整天忙于开一些没有准备、没有结果的会议。开起会来以漫无边际的空谈来代替问题认真的研究，议而不决，决而不行。他们把自己的兴趣放在送往迎来的交际活动上，饱食终日，无所事事，专讲排场。在这种官僚主义的领导下，必然就产生了置人民财产于不顾的铺张浪费现象。譬如南京文联，在兴建“南京会堂”，修理“文艺俱乐部”时，竟耗费了近三十亿元的巨款。
    一个工作人员的调动，竟三次请客欢送，用费等于一个区级干部十个月的包干费。又如上海文联，在一年之中，仅锦旗一项，送出了四百多面。上海某个刊物，召开一次通讯员座谈会也花去二百万元以上。这是多么令人触目惊心的现象！
    再从创作上看：仅电影局三部影片的作废或修改，就耗费五十亿元。这笔数目虽大，还有数可查，有更多的浪费现象是不容易一眼看清的。譬如有些作家创作一些粗制滥造的作品，有很多投机出版商，每年不知从人民那里骗取多少财富，浪费多少纸张，而他们偿还给人民的却是无益的、甚至是有害的读物。有些作者，利令智昏，专门迎合这些投机出版商，自己也变成了投机者，然而他们却毫不以为耻。有些团体成立了创作组，一年、两年不见有好作品出世，他们却并无愧色。一些毫无意义、或者有害的旧作，也开始渐渐充塞于市面了。还有一些人，专以抄袭他人作品为能事，而编辑同志们似乎在闭着眼睛工作，一任抄袭现象屡次发生而不加警惕。……这些浪费和变相的贪污现象，是不容易一下子觉察的，然而要统计起来，这数字却是非常惊人。
    在某些地方的文艺活动中，也存在着追求形式、讲求排场的铺张浪费现象。某些农村剧团，要花数十石米的代价演出与当时当地现实任务没有关系的“大剧”，这已渐渐成为风气，并受到当地文艺领导机关的鼓励。有些剧团演出的剧目内容很成问题，但他们对这方面的感觉非常迟钝，而在花钱购置道具服装等方面却显示了他们的“天才”。
    事实很明显，上述种种严重的变相贪污和铺张浪费之所以产生，和我们某些文艺团体的领导上存在着的官僚主义作风是分不开的。
    所有这一切，我们怎么能容忍呢？人民，尤其是工农群众整天辛辛苦苦地为国家创造财富，而我们某些文艺团体和某些文艺工作者不仅浪费人民的物资、精力和时间，而且还在思想意识上毒害了人民。这难道不是可鄙可耻的行为吗？对于所有类似的现象，我们必须无情地予以揭发，坚决地加以反对。
    在我们的文艺队伍中，有着数量众多的忠实于革命文艺事业的文艺工作者。他们站在工人阶级的立场，始终坚持着毛泽东同志的文艺方针，勤勤恳恳地、老老实实地为人民服务。他们是受到人民尊敬与爱戴的。但那些官僚主义者，那些投机营利、铺张浪费的人与这些优秀的文艺工作者毫无共同之点。为了加强我们思想战线上的战斗力，使人民文艺事业对国家、对人民有更多的贡献，我们就必须把我们队伍中严重存在着的缺点迅速而坚决地加以纠正，假如有些文艺团体或这些文艺工作者仍不改正错误，就应该按照胡乔木同志在北京文艺界整风动员大会上所指示的，要把这些团体“宣告解散”，要使这些文艺工作者“被所属的文艺团体所开除”。
    要根除文艺团体与文艺工作者的官僚主义习气和贪污浪费现象，我们必须要使反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，与某些地区正在进行的文艺界整风学习运动密切结合起来。文艺界，正和其它业务部门一样，所以产生贪污浪费和官僚主义，是因为我们在思想上受到资产阶级思想的侵袭。这种堕落腐朽的资产阶级思想，使得我们某些人变成鼠目寸光，除掉自己的一点眼前利益以外，再也看不到别的更重要的东西，这样就会严重地阻碍我们的政治品格的提高，就会使我们迷失了前进的方向。我们之中，有些人从旧社会带来的这种资产阶级思想还根本没有经过改造，有些人虽经过了一些改造，但很不彻底；因而当他们进入城市，接触到资产阶级的习气之后，就又旧调重弹了。一些文艺工作者就是由于这种旧思想未能得到改造或改造得不彻底，因而也就不能建立和巩固为工农兵服务的思想，或者只是口头上喊喊，从不想在实践中加以贯彻。毛主席在“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中指示我们，“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题”。而我们的某些文艺工作者恰恰就对这个问题还没有得到真正的认识。试想：办刊物不是为群众，而只是为了发泄自己的情感或表现自己，这个刊物怎能没有废品？出版作品只是为了稿费，为了满足自己的虚荣，贪图名利，他怎能不脱离生活，粗制滥造？如果演戏不是首先考虑群众的需要，而是为了满足自己追求形式的要求，怎么能不铺张浪费？文艺团体的领导者如果不负起思想领导的责任，又要在形式上来显示自己是在做工作，怎能不以奢华的排场和空洞的会议来表现自己的工作成绩？……这一切，都说明着：任何一个文艺团体，任何一个文艺工作者，如果他们不能贯彻毛主席所指示的工农兵文艺方向，就必然要在工作上或创作上犯错误，也就可能造成贪污浪费现象和官僚主义。因此，我们要求文艺工作者积极参加这个运动，结合文艺整风学习，从创作思想上，从工作和生活作风上，双管齐下，彻底扫除资产阶级的思想影响。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的展开，正和现在正在进行着的文艺界整风学习运动一样，对于我们文艺工作者，都是极其重要的。为了使我们的文学艺术事业获得更巨大的发展，为了使我们的文艺工作能更好地成为帮助形成和巩固经济基础的“极大的积极力量”，就必须整顿我们的队伍，建立正确的思想和朴素踏实的作风。资产阶级的腐败的习气和革命的文艺工作是不能相容的。因此，更深入一步地进行文艺界整风学习，以整顿文艺思想，和积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动同样是我们目前迫切的政治任务。
