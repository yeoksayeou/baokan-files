	"Materials Director" Dong Yanda
	Volunteer Army Logistics Department, Li Yun
	In March in Korea, a thin layer of ice still remained in the rivers, and in some places it had melted, with ice floes flowing towards distant places. The cold wind howled, and Dong Yanda, a driver from a certain automobile regiment of the Volunteer Army, was disassembling parts from a car that had been destroyed by enemy aircraft in a knee-deep river. The water was so cold that his legs felt like they were being cut by knives, and soon they became numb. At that moment, Dong Yanda was thinking: automobile parts are scarce on the Korean battlefield. If I take these parts back, and if the vehicles in the motor pool have broken parts, they can be replaced, wouldn't that increase transportation capacity? He thought of the workers and peasant brothers in the motherland who were creating new production records, and that he was a Youth League member: he should cherish the property of the motherland; he thought that more transportation capacity, more artillery shells transported, would mean more enemies eliminated... He disassembled parts for a while, ran on the riverbank for a while, and then went back into the water to disassemble. He finally overcame the cold wind and icy river, and disassembled many valuable parts.
	Dong Yanda is a driver in the sixth squad of the sixth company of a certain automobile regiment of the Volunteer Army, and an excellent Youth League member. Since bidding farewell to his distant hometown of Guizhou last February and setting foot on the Korean battlefield, he has been tirelessly running between the front and rear lines. By last October, the car he drove had safely traveled more than 46,000 li. Whenever he returned from the front after completing a mission, he would often bring back some automobile equipment to the company. These materials were disassembled by him from damaged old cars in mountain caves and icy rivers that had been destroyed by enemy aircraft. The other drivers respected and loved him very much. When a car was missing a part, they could often solve the problem by finding him. Therefore, the car he drove was called the "materials warehouse car" by his comrades, and some comrades affectionately called him "Materials Director."
	One day in mid-June, at dawn, Dong Yanda saw a car overturned in a very deep bomb crater near the Brothers' Cave. The car was covered with dust. He walked over and inspected it. "Although some parts are broken, if it is repaired, it is still a good car," Dong Yanda said to himself. He carefully inspected the broken car again. He happily said to his assistant, "It can be towed out." He planned to repair the tow road during the day and come back to tow the car at night. The assistant disagreed, saying:
	"I don't think this car is easy to tow out, and it's not our company's car. Just take off the usable parts!" "This is the wealth of the motherland! First disassemble the parts on the car, then the car will be lighter, and then repair the road, and it is guaranteed to be towed out." Dong Yanda criticized and encouraged his assistant at the same time. So, they disassembled the parts from the car one by one, and filled the bomb crater with stones. Originally, they had not rested for a whole night, and they were busy all day long, preparing everything. In the evening, they towed the broken car to the motor pool. Dong Yanda spent another three days repairing the car. This repaired broken car has safely traveled more than 30,000 li, and it has been continuously running on the Korean battlefield.
	In this way, in the first seven months after Dong Yanda entered the Korean battlefield, in addition to towing back and repairing a car that had been destroyed, he disassembled and returned a total of 150 major automobile parts, which, calculated at the current market value, saved the country 300 million yuan in wealth.
	Glory should belong to the soldiers who love the motherland. At the merit evaluation meeting, Dong Yanda was awarded the title of first-class hero. On October 25th last year, he represented the entire regiment at the anniversary celebration of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea convened by the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He met Commander Peng. Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, personally awarded him the Second Class Warrior Medal of Honor.

    “材料主任”董晏达
    志愿军后勤部某部  李云
    三月的朝鲜，河里还留着薄薄的一层冰，有的地方已溶化了，冰块随着水流向遥远的地方。寒风呼呼地吹着，志愿军某部汽车司机董晏达在一条水深过膝的小河里，拆卸着被敌机炸毁的汽车上的零件。水是那么的凉，两条腿像刀割一样疼痛，不一会，便麻木了。这时，董晏达在想：汽车零件在朝鲜战场是缺乏的，我把这些零件拆回去，汽车连的车子零件有坏的，给它换上，不是可以增加运输力吗？他想到祖国工人、农民兄弟们正在创造生产新纪录，自己是一个青年团员：应当爱护祖国财产；他想到多一分运输力量，多运输一颗炮弹，就能多消灭敌人……。他拆卸一会零件，到河岸上跑步一会，再下到水里去拆。他终于战胜寒风和冰河，拆下许多贵重的零件。
    董晏达是志愿军汽车某团六连六班的一个司机，是一个优秀的青年团员。从去年二月告别他那遥远的家乡——贵州，踏上朝鲜战场以后，他每天不停息地奔驰在前线和后方，到去年十月间，他驾驶的汽车已安全行车四万六千多里。每当他完成任务由前方回来时，常常要带回一些汽车器材交到连上。这些材料是他在山洞里、冰河里，从被敌机炸坏的破旧汽车上拆卸下来的。其他的汽车司机们十分尊敬他喜爱他，汽车缺什么零件时，找到他往往就可以解决问题，因而他驾驶的汽车被同志们称为“材料库车”，有些同志亲热地叫他“材料主任”。
    是六月中旬的一天拂晓，董晏达在兄弟洞附近，看见一台汽车翻倒在一个很深的炸弹坑里，车上落满了灰尘，他走过去检查一遍。“虽然坏了一部分零件，但是如果修理一番，还是一台好车。”董晏达自言自语地说着。他又围着破汽车仔细地检查一遍，他高兴地对助手说：“可以拖出去。”他计划白天把拖车的道修好，晚上再来拖车。助手不以为然地说：
    “我看这车不易拖出来，又不是我们连的车，把能用的零件拆下来就得啦！”“这是祖国的财富啊！先拆下车上零件，车子就轻了，再把道修好，保险可以拖出来。”董晏达一面批评一面鼓励着他的助手。于是，他们把车上零件一件一件地拆下来，又用石头把炸弹坑填平。本来他们已一个整晚上没有休息了，又整整忙了一白天，把一切都准备好。傍晚，他们把这辆破车拖到汽车连，董晏达又用了三天时间，把这台汽车修好。就是这辆修理好的破车已安全行驶三万余里了，而且它还一直不停息地在朝鲜战场上奔驰着呢。
    就这样，在董晏达进入朝鲜战场后的头七个月中，他除拖回并修好一辆已被炸毁的汽车外，前后共拆回一百五十件汽车主要零件，按现在市场价值计算，他为国家节约财富达三亿元。
    光荣是应该属于热爱祖国的战士的。在评功会上，董晏达被评为一等功臣。去年十月二十五日，他代表全团出席了中国人民志愿军总部召开的抗美援朝一周年纪念大会。他见到了彭司令员。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国金枓奉委员长亲自给他戴上二等战士荣誉勋章。
