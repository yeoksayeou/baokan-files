Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th – Our special correspondent reports: The discussion on the third item of the Korean armistice negotiations agenda has lasted for forty days. Due to the U.S. side's endless delaying tactics, the two sides have still failed to reach an agreement. At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item on the 5th, the U.S. representative, Turner, while insisting on the U.S. side's aggressive demands to interfere in Korea's internal affairs, absurdly asked the Korean and Chinese side to forget about sovereignty and internal affairs, and reiterated the cliché that it is right for the U.S. side to interfere in some of Korea's internal affairs. He even said: Internal affairs and sovereignty are fragmented words and have no meaning whatsoever. General Xie Fang once again warned him: You call yourselves angels of peace and civilized people, and openly declare that you want others to give up their sovereignty and allow interference in their internal affairs. Don't dream of such a thing; it is absolutely not allowed.

However, this American general, who tramples on the sovereignty of independent countries, shamelessly talked about "Sino-American friendship." Turner self-deceptively said that the United States had no intention of threatening the Yalu River or attacking China. General Xie Fang immediately questioned him: When the U.S. invading army reached the Pyongyang and Wonsan lines the year before last, they clamored to cross the Yalu River and establish a U.S. military defense line on the opposite bank of the Yalu River. U.S. military aircraft have repeatedly bombed and strafed Andong and other places in China. Later, when the U.S. military reached Chushan, they used artillery fire to bombard Ji'an County across the river. Is this China attacking the United States, or is the United States attacking China? General Xie Fang also questioned him: If you are friendly to the Chinese people, why do you occupy Taiwan? You occupy Taiwan and still say you are friendly. Are you saying this because you only occupy a small part of China and have not occupied the whole of China? You bombarded Ji'an, bombed Andong, and raided Shenyang. Are these friendly actions? General Xie Fang wanted Turner to understand: Such pleasant words cannot deceive the Chinese people and the people of the world. He said: You cannot represent the American people, nor can you represent the people of Britain, France, or the Netherlands, let alone the people of the whole world. Your policy and means of antagonizing the people of the world are just the policies and means of a few warmongers.

Sources here point out that the U.S. side's insistence on unreasonable demands to interfere in Korea's internal affairs and its endless delaying tactics in negotiations are aimed at maintaining international tensions, sacrificing the interests of the American people and the people of Western European countries, so that a handful of American big capitalists can obtain huge war profits. However, as General Xie Fang pointed out: The people of the world have already understood the true purpose of the U.S. side's delaying tactics and the U.S. side's lack of sincerity in the negotiations. He said: If the U.S. side is truly willing to show effort and is truly willing to negotiate, they must face the reality of the Korean War and recognize the balance of military forces between the two sides. The U.S. side has no reason to force the Korean and Chinese side to accept unreasonable demands to interfere in Korea's internal affairs.

### 新华社记者揭露  美方无休止地玩弄拖延手段是为了大资本家赚战争利润

    新华社记者揭露
    美方无休止地玩弄拖延手段是为了大资本家赚战争利润
    【新华社开城六日电】本社特派记者报道：朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的讨论已历时四十天，由于美方无休止地玩弄拖延手段，双方仍未能取得协议。在五日第三项议程的小组委员会上，美方代表滕纳在坚持美方干涉朝鲜内政的侵略性要求时，竟荒谬地要朝中方面忘掉主权和内政，并重弹滥调说什么美方干涉朝鲜一部分内政是应该的。他竟然说：内政、主权是支离破碎的字句，是没有任何意义的。解方将军再度正告他：你们自称和平天使、文明分子，公然宣称要让别人放弃主权，将内政让人干涉。你们不要做这种梦想，这是绝不能允许的。
    但是，像这样一位把独立国家主权踩在脚下的美国将军，竟然厚颜无耻地谈起“中美友好”来了。滕纳自欺欺人地说什么美国无意威胁鸭绿江、无意进攻中国。解方将军当即质问他：前年美国侵略军打到平壤、元山一线，就叫嚣着要打过鸭绿江，还要在鸭绿江对岸建立美军防线。美国的军用飞机曾多次轰炸扫射中国的安东等地。后来，美军打到楚山时，又用炮火向隔江的辑安县轰击。这是中国进攻美国，还是美国进攻中国？解方将军又质问他：你们对中国人民友好，为什么你们霸占台湾？霸占了台湾，还说友好，你们这样说话是因为只占了中国的一小部分而没有霸占全中国吗？你们炮轰辑安，轰炸安东，空袭沈阳，这就是友好的行动吗？解方将军要滕纳明白：这样好听的字眼是欺骗不了中国人民和世界人民的。他说：你们既不能代表美国人民，也不能代表英国、法国、荷兰的人民，更不能代表全世界人民。你们那种和世界人民为敌的政策和手段，只是少数好战分子的政策和手段。
    此间人士指出：美方坚持干涉朝鲜内政的无理要求，无休止地玩弄拖延谈判的手段的目的是：保持国际紧张形势，牺牲美国人民和西欧国家人民的利益，使一小撮美国大资本家能取得巨额的战争利润。但是，如解方将军所指出的：全世界人民已经明白美方拖延谈判的真正目的和美方缺乏谈判的诚意。他说：如果美方真愿表示努力，真愿进行谈判，他们就必须面对朝鲜战争的现实，承认双方军事力量的平衡状态。美方就无任何理由强迫朝中方面接受干涉朝鲜内政的无理要求。
