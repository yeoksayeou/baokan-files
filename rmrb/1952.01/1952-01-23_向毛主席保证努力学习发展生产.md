The entire students of the Liaodong Province Honorary Servicemen Vocational School report their victories on the learning front

Respected Chairman Mao: Please accept our utmost respect and heartfelt admiration.

We fought against the enemy at all different times and battlefields in the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the Eight-Year War of Resistance, the Three-Year War of Liberation, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, under your wise leadership, for the liberation of the motherland and the protection of a happy life. We shed blood honorably, were wounded, and became revolutionary disabled soldiers.

You care about us and established honorary servicemen schools for us. Let us learn culture, politics, and work skills, and then go to the glorious positions of production and construction, to implement our will to serve the people to the end. Now, we have won a great victory in learning: those who were illiterate in the past can now not only understand the People's Daily, but also write articles and newsletters of 1,500 to 1,600 words with considerable content and vivid sentences. Now, we all have the cultural level of junior high school grades one and two in all subjects. In the two years since the establishment of our school, more than 500 people have graduated and participated in work. In one instance the year before last, more than 270 students volunteered to go to the Korean battlefield to work as supply stations, transportation, escorts, and other statistical and accounting work. In all kinds of work, they successfully completed their tasks and were praised by their superiors. Those who are assigned to other jobs, such as mines, factories, and government agencies, are also able to do their jobs happily.

Respected Chairman Mao: You taught us to pay attention to health. Although our bodies are disabled, we will never be discouraged. As long as it is beneficial to our health, we will appropriately choose one or several sports according to our physical conditions. We are determined to exercise our disabled bodies to be as strong as steel!

Respected Chairman Mao: Your soldiers are fighting and learning tirelessly and tenaciously. We, the 1,100 students, assure you: We will continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work and simplicity that you taught us, maintain the honor given to us by the people; obey the leadership of the school in learning, listen attentively to the teachers' lectures, and modelly abide by various disciplines; learn all courses well and complete learning tasks. We will use practical actions to defend the motherland and strive to build the motherland to answer your concern for us.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 All students of the Liaodong Province Honorary Servicemen Vocational School

The Garan Tibetan people of Xunhua County, Qinghai Province, thank Chairman Mao for caring for them.

People's Leader Chairman Mao: We happily wish you good health.

Looking at today's happy life, we naturally think of the bloody days before liberation. In the past, our Guoluo tribes in pastoral areas were brutally persecuted by the Ma Bufang bandit gang. The Ma bandits killed thousands of people and plundered countless cattle, sheep, horses, and other property. The massacres and plunder carried out by the Ma bandits against the Labrang tribes are incalculable. The Ma bandits burned down the upper and lower fields of Re'guang, the upper and lower Sangge incense, Dashan Temple, Guode pastoral area, Zangguoba and other temples and villages; he handed the severed heads to the parents of the deceased, or hung them all over the streets; he robbed all the livestock and property. We think of the crimes of the Ma Bufang bandit gang and hate them to the bone.

Just as we were struggling in dire straits, the great people's leader Chairman Mao—your brave and good fighting army drove away the demon Ma bandits. We were rescued and began to live a peaceful and happy life. Here, your army cherishes us like parents care for their children, and helps us with everything, big and small. Your army also carried out work such as wasteland reclamation, canal excavation, weeding, tree planting, and suppressing bandits. Your army is working day and night for our benefit. Most recently, your compassionate epidemic prevention team came here and treated a large number of male and female patients without compensation. We have escaped from the torment of disease and pain, and we are very grateful to you. Moreover, in a happy mood, we have become good friends with the comrades in your army.

Our Yellow Sect, Black Sect, Red Sect and other monks all chant scriptures to pray for Chairman Mao's cause to become increasingly glorious. We will definitely respond to your call as soon as possible, carry out agricultural production well, and strengthen the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. We will definitely make Chairman Mao happy.

    向毛主席保证努力学习发展生产
　　辽东省荣誉军人职业学校全体学员报告他们在学习战线上的胜利 
    敬爱的毛主席：请您接受我们无比崇高和衷心的敬意。
    我们是在第二次国内革命战争、八年抗战、三年解放战争和抗美援朝的各个不同时代、不同战场，在您的英明领导下，为了祖国的解放和保卫幸福的生活，不顾一切地和敌人搏斗过的。我们光荣地流了血、负了伤，成了革命残废军人。
    您关心我们，为我们设立了荣军学校。让我们学习文化、政治，学习工作本领，再走上光荣的生产建设的岗位，贯彻我们为人民服务到底的意志。现在，我们在学习上已经打了一个大胜仗：过去不识字的，现在不但能看懂人民日报，并且能写出内容相当充实、词句相当生动的一千五、六百字的文章和通讯稿了。现在，我们各科都已经具有初中一、二年级的文化水平。我们学校成立以来的两年间，出校参加工作的已经在五百人以上。前年的一次，就有二百七十多同学志愿到朝鲜战场作兵站、运输、押运和其他统计、会计等工作。在各种工作中，都胜利地完成了任务，并且得到上级的表扬。就是分配在别的工作岗位上的，如矿山、工厂、政府机关等，也都能够胜任愉快。
    敬爱的毛主席：您教导我们要注意健康。我们的身体虽然残废了，但是我们决不自馁。只要是对身体有益的，我们就按照各自身体的条件，适当地选择一种或几种运动。我们有决心，把残废的身体锻炼得仍像钢铁一样的坚强！
    敬爱的毛主席：您的战士是永远不疲倦地、顽强地战斗着、学习着。我们一千一百名学员向您保证：我们要继续发扬您教导我们的艰苦朴素的作风，保持人民给予我们的荣誉；在学习中服从学校领导，专心听老师讲授，模范地遵守各种纪律；学好各门课程，完成学习任务。我们将要用保卫祖国和努力建设祖国的实际行动，来回答您对我们的关怀。
                             辽东省荣誉军人职业学校全体学员
　　青海省循化县嘎让藏族人民感谢毛主席爱护他们
    人民的领袖毛主席：我们愉快地祝贺您的健康。
    看看今天的幸福生活，我们很自然地想起了解放以前的血腥的日子。过去，我们牧区果洛部落受到马匪步芳残酷地迫害。马匪杀死几千人，抢掠了无数的牛、羊、马匹和其他财物。马匪对拉卜楞各部落进行过的屠杀抢掠，已无法计算。马匪烧毁了热光上下场、上下桑格香、达善寺、郭德农牧区、藏郭巴等寺院和村庄；他把砍下的人头交给死者的父母，或满街悬挂；他把牧畜财物尽数抢去。我们想起了马匪步芳的罪行，真是痛恨入骨。
    正当我们在水火中挣扎的时候，伟大的人民领袖毛主席——您的英勇善战的军队，把恶魔马匪赶走了。我们被解救了，开始过着和平、幸福的日子。在我们这里，您的军队好像父母爱护子女一样地爱护我们，无论大小事情都给我们帮助。您的军队还进行开荒、开渠、除草、植树和肃清土匪等工作。您的军队日以继夜地为我们谋福利。最近一次，您的慈悲满心的防疫队，到我们这里，对广大的男女病人，无代价地治疗。我们脱离了病魔和痛苦，万分地感谢您。并且，我们在高兴的情绪下，和您的军队里的同志们做了好朋友。
    我们黄教、黑教、红教等僧人都诵经祈祷毛主席的事业日益光辉。我们一定尽先响应您的号召，好好进行农业生产，加强抗美援朝的工作。我们一定使毛主席高兴。
