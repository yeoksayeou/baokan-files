　　Economic Briefs

　　▲ To supervise the implementation of contracts and agreements worth over 1.5 trillion yuan, which were concluded at the North China Region's Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition last year, the Contract and Agreement Inspection and Implementation Committee was established on January 11th under the leadership of the Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. The main tasks of this committee are to: inspect the implementation of contracts and agreements concluded at the exhibition, resolve major problems occurring in the implementation of contracts and agreements, and urge all regions to pay agreement handling fees in a timely manner.

　　This committee plans to hold a reporting meeting of the financial and economic committees of the five provinces and two cities in North China in early February. After listening to reports from various regions on the implementation of contracts and agreements, it will send people to various regions for inspection. The committee also entrusted the financial and economic committees of major administrative regions to assist in inspecting and supervising the implementation of contracts and agreements signed at the North China Region's Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition in their respective regions.

　　▲ Changting County is a base area from the Second Domestic Revolutionary War period and one of the most important handmade paper production areas in the country. More than half of the county's population of 120,000 people rely on the paper industry for a living. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, Changting County's highest paper production reached 100,000 dan. After the Red Army went north, the paper industry suffered enormous damage due to the destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the output in 1945 fell to just over 5,800 dan. After liberation, the People's Government successively issued paper industry loans of 1.29 billion yuan, enabling Changting County's paper production to gradually recover. Last year, the county produced more than 60,000 dan of paper, more than double the output in the early days of liberation. Farmers sing such a folk song with joy: "Chairman Mao leads us through the year of emancipation, distributed bamboo mountains and fields, abundant rice harvests and good paper prices, wearing new clothes and laughing continuously."

　　▲ In the past year, animal husbandry and veterinary services in the Southwest region have developed considerably. The mortality rate of livestock has generally decreased compared to before liberation, and the increase in draught cattle, pigs, and sheep has been rapid. According to statistics from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, the number of draught cattle in the Southwest region has increased by 21 percent in the past year, goats have increased by 11 percent, and pigs have increased by 32 percent. Last year, local people's governments in the Southwest region prevented and controlled cattle plague for more than 796,000 draught cattle for farmers.

    ▲长汀县是第二次国内革命战争时期的根据地，是全国重要手工产纸区之一。占全县人口半数以上的十二万人民，靠纸业为生。长汀县在第二次国内革命战争时期的最高产纸量达十万担，红军北上后，由于国民党反动派的摧残，纸业遭受极大的破坏，一九四五年的产量竟降至五千八百余担。解放后，人民政府先后贷出十二亿九千万元的纸业贷款，使长汀县纸业生产逐渐恢复。去年全县共产纸六万余担，比解放初期的产量增加一倍。农民欢唱着这样一首山歌：“毛主席领导我们过翻身年，分了竹山又分田，稻子丰收纸价好，穿起新衣笑连连。”
    ▲过去一年，西南区畜牧兽医事业已有相当发展，牲畜的死亡率比解放前已普遍减低，耕牛和猪、羊增殖很快。据西南军政委员会农林部统计，西南区的耕牛一年来增加了百分之二十一，山羊增加了百分之十一，猪增加了百分之三十二。去年，西南各地人民政府为制止牛瘟蔓延，为农民防治了七十九万六千多头耕牛。
