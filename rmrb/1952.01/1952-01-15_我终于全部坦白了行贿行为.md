I Finally Confessed All My Acts of Bribery
Dong Gendao, Manager of Chongqing Dingchang Hardware Store

I am Dong Gendao, the manager of Chongqing Dingchang Hardware Store. I often do business with government agencies and organizations. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, every transaction required giving kickbacks to the purchasing personnel and entertaining every relevant person in the relevant agencies. If you didn't bribe everyone, you couldn't get things done. I muddled through in that society for over a decade and learned a set of skills in speculation and bribery. I regarded it as my "magic weapon" for making money. After the liberation of Chongqing, I brought this "magic weapon" to the new society without changing it. I only thought about how to get rich and enjoy myself, and never thought about the interests of the country and the people.

In the early days of liberation, most of the financial personnel in the people's government were retained personnel who had not been reformed. Therefore, my "magic weapon" was still very "effective." But there were also times when it didn't work. Because most of the cadres of the people's government are indeed honest and not susceptible to temptation. But I tried every means to lure them into the trap. Once, a comrade named Hou Yingguo from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army came to our store from another place to buy goods. He was a veteran cadre with a very hardworking and simple style. I hinted that I wanted to give him money, but he refused. So I thought of other ways to corrupt him. He saw lighters being sold on the street and wanted to buy one, but he thought they were too expensive. I seized this opportunity and said to him, I have a spare one at home. If you like it, I'd be happy to give it to you. In fact, I didn't have a spare one at all. Secretly, I went to the Qunlin Market and bought the best "Ronson" lighter to give to him. This way, he finally fell into my trap. Our business deal went through. He only received a few hundred thousand yuan worth of gifts, but I made a huge profit of seven or eight million yuan from this transaction.

In June 1951, the Xiao Ziyan embezzlement case was exposed in Chongqing, and I was very frightened. I thought that my cases, large and small, were not few. Just the bribes I gave to Wan Zunfu, the deputy section chief of the Hardware Section of the Southwest District Company of the China Industrial Equipment Company, amounted to fifteen million yuan. Once the people's government found out, my family would be ruined. On the other hand, due to education from study and participation in various movements, my thinking also began to change. I thought: I can earn money steadily without speculation and bribery. Why do I have to engage in those illegal activities? Am I worthy to be a member of the people if I secretly engage in these despicable activities of stealing state property? My conscience often reproached me. But when the people's government initially called on us to confess, I had many concerns. I was afraid of retaliation from corrupt elements, afraid of returning the ill-gotten gains, and afraid that publishing it in the newspaper would damage my reputation and make it difficult to develop business in the future. After considering the results, I thought that confession was more dangerous than safe. So I comforted myself, saying: Only I and the other party know about these collusive things. If he doesn't talk, and I don't talk, no one will know. I'll just stop doing it from now on. But on the other hand, I thought, no, if you don't talk, the other party may not keep quiet; if neither of us talks, my shop assistants will talk. "If you don't want people to know, don't do it." Besides, the people's government has always been so thorough in whatever it does, and things will eventually come to light. Therefore, I was restless all day long, anxiously inquiring about the movements of the same industry, seeing what they were doing. One evening, I heard that a hardware and electrical materials store had thoroughly confessed its bribery to the market management committee and had not been subjected to a complete loss of property. At this time, my mood calmed down slightly. Later, a good friend of mine, Gan Zihong, the manager of Zhengchang Hardware Store, came to talk to me. He said that he had already confessed his bribery to the court and was waiting for processing. He asked me if I had any embezzlement or bribery. Encouraged by him, I had the courage to decide to go to the court immediately to confess. But I wandered back and forth at the gate of the court three or four times and dared not go in. I thought my case was big, and once I went in, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get out. In the end, I went back home. That day, the ideological struggle was the most intense, I couldn't eat, and I didn't sleep all night. I couldn't bear it anymore. The next day, as soon as it dawned, I ran to the court again. I met a comrade named Song Ruchun in the inquiry room of the court, and I stammered and told him some of my bribery. He comforted me and said, "It's good that you can boldly confess, but you should go to the Industry and Commerce Bureau or the Federation of Industry and Commerce to confess first." I immediately turned to the market management committee and told a comrade named Dai Mingxiang. He said it was very good, and told me to go back and write a confession. When I got home to write the confession, I had concerns again. I thought I might as well write a part first and see how it goes. That would be safer. After I submitted the confession, he said, as long as you thoroughly confess and sincerely repent, the people's government will definitely treat you leniently. But because I still had a large part that I hadn't confessed, I still carried a heavy burden on my mind. Sometimes, after closing the shop at night, I would jump when someone knocked on the door, fearing that it was about the case. On the 4th of this month, the Trade Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, the Chongqing Store Employees' Union, and the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly held a mobilization meeting against corruption and bribery. Every word and sentence of the mobilization report of the leaders at the meeting struck my heart. I realized that my concerns were unnecessary, and the kind of light confession I had made in the past couldn't solve the problem. At that time, I wanted to go on stage to confess, but my colleagues said, "Haven't you already confessed?" I thought to myself, you don't know that I still have big things that I haven't confessed. Later, because of time constraints, the conference did not allow industrialists and businessmen to go on stage to confess. That night, when I returned to our study group of the same industry, I confessed my shameful behavior. The next day, the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Chongqing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association jointly held a confession and accusation meeting against corruption and bribery. I took the lead in thoroughly confessing all my crimes to the masses at the meeting. I also denounced several colleagues who were still hesitating and watching. That night, I slept soundly until dawn. From then on, the big stone in my heart was finally lifted. I am now waiting for the people's government to give me the punishment I deserve.

### 我终于全部坦白了行贿行为

    我终于全部坦白了行贿行为
    重庆市鼎昌五金号经理　董根道
    我是重庆市鼎昌五金号经理，经常和机关团体做生意。在国民党反动统治时期，每成交一笔生意就要给采购人员送回扣，还要应酬对方机关里每一个有关的人员。一处不贿赂到就过不了关。我在这种社会里鬼混了十几年，学会了一套投机行贿的本领。我把它当成我生财有道的“法宝”。重庆解放后，我原封不动地把这个“法宝”带到新社会里来使用。我只想到怎样才能发财享福，根本没有想到国家人民的利益。
    解放初期，人民政府财经机关里有大部分没有经过改造的留用人员，因此，我那一套“法宝”在使用时还很“灵验”。但也有失效的时候。因为人民政府的大多数干部确实是廉洁的，他们不受勾引。我却想尽了千方百计引诱他们上钩。有一次解放军某部一个叫侯应国的同志从外地到我们店里买货。他是个老干部，作风非常刻苦朴素。我暗示要送钱给他，他不要。于是我就从其他方面来想办法腐蚀他。他在街上看见卖的打火机他很想买，但嫌贵。我就抓住这个空子对他说，我家里有一个多余的，假如你喜欢，我愿意送给你。其实我家里根本没有多余的，暗地里我到群林市场买了一个最好的“朗生”打火机送给他。这样他终于跌进了我的圈套。我们的生意成交了，他只得到几十万元的礼物，我却在这一笔交易里获得七八百万元的暴利。
    一九五一年六月份重庆揭露了萧子言大贪污案，我心里非常恐惧。我想我的案子大大小小算起来也不算少，单是给中国工业器材公司西南区公司五金科副科长万尊福的贿赂就有一千五百万元，一旦被人民政府查出来，保不定会家破人亡。另一方面，由于学习和参加各种运动受到教育，我的思想也开始起了变化。我想：不用投机行贿一样可以稳稳当当赚钱，为什么一定要去干那些非法勾当？暗地里干这些偷窃国家财产的卑鄙勾当，我还配当人民中的一分子吗？我常常受到我的良心责备。但当人民政府最初号召我们坦白时，我却顾虑多端。我怕贪污分子报复、怕倒赃、怕报上登出来信誉败坏，将来业务展不开。考虑结果认为坦白是凶多吉少。于是我就安慰自己说：这些勾结的事只有我和对方知道，他不讲，我不讲，没人知道，以后从此洗手不干就是了。可是，反过来一想，不行，你不讲，对方保不住不讲；我们两个都不讲，我的店员也会讲。“要想人不知，除非己不为”。何况人民政府过去不管做那样事情都是那样彻底，事情终究有一天要水落石出。因此我整天坐卧不安，惶惶恐恐地到处打听同业的动静，看他们怎样。有一天晚上听说有一家五金电料行向市场管理委员会彻底坦白了自己行贿的事，并没有受到倾家荡产的处分，这时我的心情稍微平静了一下。后来，我有一个好朋友正昌五金号经理甘子宏找我谈，他说他已经将他的行贿事向法院坦白，正在等候处理。他问我有没有贪污行贿的事。我被他这一劝，有了勇气，决定立刻到法院去坦白。但到了法院门口来回徘徊了三四次不敢进去。我想我的案子大，一进去恐怕就出不来了。结果还是转回家来。这一天思想斗争得最激烈，饭也吃不进，一夜没有睡着。我实在忍受不了，第二天天一亮我又跑到法院去。在法院询事室会见一个名叫宋汝春的同志，我吞吞吐吐地把我行贿的事对他说了一些。他安慰我说：“你能大胆坦白是好的，但你先到工商局或工商业联合会去坦白好了。”我马上转到市场管理委员会找到一位名叫戴铭祥的同志说了。他说很好，你回去写份坦白书来。回到家里写坦白书的时候，我又有顾虑。我想我不如先写一部分试试看，这样比较保险些。我把坦白书交过后，他说，你只要彻底坦白真诚悔过，人民政府一定会从宽处理的。但由于我还有一大部分没有坦白，思想上还背着沉重的包袱。有时候晚上停止营业后，遇到有人敲门我就心惊肉跳，生怕是案子犯了。本月四日西南军政委员会贸易部、重庆市店员工会、重庆市工商业联合会联合举行一个反贪污、反行贿动员大会。会上各位首长的动员报告一字一句都打中我的心坎，我认识到我的顾虑都是不必要的，过去那种避重就轻的坦白解决不了问题。当时我就想上台去坦白，我的同业说：“你不是早已坦白过了？”我心里想，你们那里知道我还有大的没有坦白。后来因为时间限制，大会没有让工商业者上台坦白。当天晚上我回到我们同业的学习小组上就坦白了我的可耻行为。第二天，重庆市工商业联合会和民主建国会重庆分会联合举行了一个反贪污反行贿坦白检举大会，我在会上带头彻底向群众坦白了我的一切罪行。我并当场检举了几个还在犹豫观望的同业。这天夜里，我一觉睡到天亮。从此，压在心里的大石头落了地。我现在正在等待人民政府给我应有的处分。（新华社）
