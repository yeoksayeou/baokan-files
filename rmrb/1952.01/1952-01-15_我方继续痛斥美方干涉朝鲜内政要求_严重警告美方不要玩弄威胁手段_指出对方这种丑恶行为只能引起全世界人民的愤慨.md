    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th. At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on January 14, our representative continued to denounce the unreasonable demands of the other side to interfere in our internal affairs after the armistice. They also exposed the other side's recent continuous acts of threat and provocation and issued a serious warning to the other side. Our representative pointed out that our plan of January 9 reasonably agreed to the other side's repeated demands for necessary replacement of military equipment during the armistice. This plan is a completely sufficient and reasonable solution to the third agenda item. However, the other side still insists on the unreasonable demand to restrict equipment within Korea, attempting to interfere in our internal affairs. When this unreasonable demand cannot be realized at the negotiation meeting, they resort to blatant provocative behavior to threaten us. On January 13, the other side openly took such provocative action, with several batches of their aircraft invading the airspace of Northeast China. Our representative sternly pointed out: "On August 22 last year, when your side could not realize your absurd and unreasonable military demarcation line plan proposed on July 27 in the negotiation meeting, you sent aircraft to bomb our delegation, intentionally sabotaging the negotiations. If your side can accept that lesson, you should not play with this kind of intimidation and provocative means again. This ugly provocative behavior will only arouse the indignation of the people of the world, and will not scare the power of the great people. Peace-loving people all over the world will resolutely fight for peace to the end." At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, the other side representatives absurdly attempted to portray their proposal as beneficial to both sides. Our representative sternly questioned the other side: "Your proposal requires our side to release all prisoners of war, but your side only releases a portion of prisoners of war, while detaining the vast majority of our captured personnel as hostages, demanding that our side exchange them for civilians. If our side requires your side to release all of our captured personnel, but our side only releases a portion of prisoners of war, and requires your side to exchange the remaining prisoners of war for civilians, would your side agree to such an exchange?" The other side was speechless and consistently avoided answering directly.

    我方继续痛斥美方干涉朝鲜内政要求
    严重警告美方不要玩弄威胁手段
    指出对方这种丑恶行为只能引起全世界人民的愤慨
    【新华社开城十四日电】一月十四日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续痛斥对方企图在停战后干涉我方内政的无理要求。并揭露对方近日来连续的威胁挑衅行为，向对方提出了严重的警告。我方代表指出我方一月九日的方案，在合理范围内同意了对方所一再坚持的在停战期间进行必要的军事装备的替换的要求，这一方案是解决第三项议程完全充分和合理的方案。但对方却至今仍然坚持限制朝鲜境内设备的无理要求，企图干涉我方内政。而在谈判会议无法实现这种无理要求时，更采取了露骨的挑衅行为进行威胁。一月十三日对方又公然采取了这种挑衅的行动，对方飞机数批侵入中华人民共和国东北的领空。我方代表严词指出：“去年八月二十二日当你方在谈判会议中无法实现你方在七月二十七日所提出的荒谬无理的军事分界线的方案时，你方就曾经派遣飞机轰炸我方代表团，有意破坏谈判。如果你方能够接受那一经验教训，你方就不应该再次玩弄这种虚声恫吓威胁挑衅的手段。这种丑恶的挑衅行为，将只能引起全世界人民的愤慨，而吓不倒伟大人民的力量。全世界爱好和平的人民将坚决为和平而奋斗到底。”第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方代表荒谬地企图将对方提案说成是对双方都有利的。我方代表严词向对方质问：“你方提案要求我方释放全部战俘但你方则只释放一部分战俘，而扣留绝大部分我方被俘人员作为人质，要求我方以平民交换。如果我方要求你方释放全部我方被俘人员，但我方只释放一部分战俘，而要求你方以平民交换其余的战俘，你方是否同意这样一种交换。”对方无词以对，始终避免正面答复。
