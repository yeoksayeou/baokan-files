Purging My Bourgeois Ideology
Self-Criticism by Huo Qinglin, Director of the Communications Bureau of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, Compiled by Zhao Wenzheng

After entering the city, due to the erosion of bourgeois ideology, I committed many errors and a major incident of corruption and waste occurred, resulting in a huge loss of 3.27427 billion yuan in state assets—equivalent to the value of two fighter planes. The damage to the people's cause is truly too great!

I grew up in a poor peasant family. I joined the revolution at the age of fifteen. Under the cultivation of the Party, my work style has always been arduous. When I first entered Taiyuan, I couldn't bear to throw away a coarse cloth quilt that had been used for five or six years. In the war environment of over ten years, I never wore socks in the summer, always wearing a pair of rough-soled shoes. At that time, I deeply loathed the bourgeois lifestyle. Therefore, when I first entered the city, the workers had a very good impression of me. They said, "We have never seen such a simple and unadorned director." They often approached me. But soon after entering the city, my clothes changed, and my ideological style also changed somewhat. The workers said I had changed and fewer people approached me. Although I have not yet embarked on the road of corruption and degeneration, I was close to the edge. If the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy had been delayed for another year, my future would have been very dangerous. So, why did I change so quickly? How was I eroded and influenced by bourgeois ideology?

When I first entered the city, I had two kinds of feelings: one was to regard myself as a victor; the other was to feel that I had been in the revolution for more than ten years, and I was from a working-class background, so I didn't care about anything. Because I lost vigilance in my thinking and lost the proletarian fighting spirit, various non-proletarian consciousnesses grew, and I became a target for bourgeois "sugar-coated bullets." I agreed with the comrades below to carry out ideological struggle, but I was unwilling for comrades to criticize me, and I did not welcome comrades to offer me opposing opinions. I always thought I was smarter than others. This closed the door to progress and blinded my eyes.

At the same time, selfish individualism also developed. From the time I started working until after entering the city in 1949, I never went home once. That year I entered the city, my parents came to see me. From then on, I thought of the suffering my parents had endured when I was young, and I developed the mentality of taking care of my family. My older brother worked as a blacksmith in Taiyuan. When I first entered the city, he saw that I was living a hard life and gave me money to spend. In 1950, he had to stop working because he had no raw materials. He came to the Communications Bureau to find me, and I gave him some convenience, introducing him to buy 17,650 jin of iron frames from the bureau. In 1951, I also introduced him to buy a rubber-wheeled vehicle from the Transportation Factory (under the jurisdiction of the Transportation Bureau). This kind of behavior of benefiting oneself at the expense of the public caused a very bad impact on the Party and the government.

In work and study, because I did not fully recognize the important tasks in the new environment, I did not actively study professional skills to improve my work ability and policy level. More than 90 percent of the cadres in the Transportation Bureau were retained personnel. But I never seriously studied the cadre policy. It was not until after the "cadre review" last year that my understanding of the cadre policy became clearer. The business of the Transportation Bureau is very complex, and many issues involve relationships with private merchants. I have not conducted serious research in this area either. I thought that I had been working for more than ten years and would not make any big mistakes, but as a result, I made mistakes.

Because I carried the burden of complacency and let things drift, I gradually became infected with bourgeois ideology and changed my original hardworking and simple style. My change in this regard started with the issue of my spouse. Before entering Taiyuan, I had a spouse. But because her education level was low, and she liked to find fault, the relationship between the two of us was not very good soon after marriage. But because we were in the old liberated area at that time, the thought of divorcing her was not very strong. After entering Taiyuan, seeing the colorful things in the city, and seeing many beautiful and cultured women, I made up my mind to divorce. As a result, I remarried a woman (a college student) from a bureaucratic bourgeois family. Because I pursued her so strongly, I adopted an attitude of accommodating and flattering her, changing the hardworking and simple style that I had always maintained. I became more and more particular about clothing and food, and more and more "generous" in economic spending. Sometimes I felt that I was spending too much money, but I was afraid of ruining the relationship with my spouse, so I reluctantly accommodated her. In particular, once she wanted to spend more than 800,000 yuan to buy me a Western-style uniform, which caused an ideological struggle in my mind. How could an old cadre from a working-class background spend so much money to buy a set of clothes? I was unhappy, but I didn't dare to object. Over time, I became accustomed to such things. As a result, in July 1950, when she beat a clerk for eating ice cream and was criticized by the People's Government, I still felt sorry for her and sent a secretary to the Public Security Bureau to intercede for her. Since I could not transform her, and I did not welcome the People's Government's education of her, I was ideologically and emotionally separated from the working class and unconsciously fell into the quagmire of the bourgeoisie.

After 1949, I felt even more that it was a bit "shameful" for a director to ride a bicycle, so I constantly rode in cars. In 1951, I felt uncomfortable sitting in the bureau's car, thinking that these cars were old-fashioned, and I thought about buying a beautiful new sedan (but I didn't buy it because it was too expensive). When I held a cadre meeting in 1949, I still couldn't stand that extravagant and wasteful large banquet. But after 1950, I felt that not having a banquet was a sign of stinginess. By 1951, not only did we have to have a banquet every time we held a meeting, but we had to have a banquet for everything, big or small, believing that not having a banquet was not enough to illustrate the importance of the matter. Therefore, the expenses of the agency increased year by year. The expenses in 1949 did not reach the budget, in 1950 it exceeded the budget by 20 million yuan, and in 1951 it exceeded 90 million yuan.

In terms of ideology, I was pursuing "grandeur" and "ostentation," and in terms of work, I was not going deep into the grassroots, so the style of document-fetishism and bureaucracy became more and more serious. In the early days of entering the city, I often participated in workers' meetings and solicited workers' opinions. But later I felt that this was too trivial and did not have the air of a large agency. So, in 1950, I began to formulate various grand but impractical systems. A total of ten or so were formulated, compiled into a book of more than 40 pages, and promoted downwards, which lasted for three or four months, but it did not work. However, I did not learn a lesson from this. Later, I sat in the office all day reading official documents, signing, and stamping. This isolated me from the masses, and I only listened to one side. For example, the old iron materials sold in 1950 were only decided at a meeting, and then the corrupt elements Song Jian and Zhao Yiru were allowed to sell them at will, without checking once. As a result, the corrupt elements colluded with private merchants to steal and sell our good electric rollers and batteries. Once, the corrupt element Song Jian asked me if the alcohol was broken and could be sold. I also perfunctorily agreed that he could sell it, and I never thought that they were playing tricks. Because I was no longer observing them from the standpoint of the working class, but from a purely technical point of view, I affirmed that they were good cadres, thinking that they were eloquent, literate, and capable, and could be trusted. So, in more than a year, Song Jian was promoted to section chief, and I even planned to promote him to deputy director. Because I lost vigilance against the corrupt elements, the extremely sinful corrupt element Zhang Yunbo escaped.

This kind of bourgeois ideology, manifested in business methods, is the pursuit of profit and the lack of a national concept. When we sold scrap iron, it was 8 liang of rice per jin of iron when sold to the steel factory, and 12 liang when sold to private merchants. I decided to sell it to private merchants. The corrupt element Song Jian said that buying wood could make money, and I agreed with his opinion. As a result, the state's financial system was undermined. In addition, the task of assigning 700,000 jin of rice to the business office to be handed over each year was also entirely based on the pursuit of profit.

After entering the city, I could not withstand the attack of bourgeois ideology and was defeated in the face of "sugar-coated bullets," thus causing a huge loss of state property. This is my great mistake. I sincerely accept the punishment from the higher authorities. However, I will never be discouraged because I was defeated in the face of the bourgeois attack! Under the correct leadership of the Party, I will thoroughly liquidate myself in the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, take up the weapon of Marxism-Leninism, and start fighting again.

    清算我的资产阶级思想
    山西省人民政府交通局局长　霍清林检讨  赵文正整理
    我在进城以后，由于受了资产阶级思想的侵袭，犯了很多错误，发生了很大的贪污浪费事件，国家资财受了三十二亿七千四百二十七万元的巨大损失——等于两架战斗机的价值。这对人民事业的损害实在是太大了！
    我生长在一个贫苦的农民家庭中。十五岁就参加了革命。在党的培养下，我的作风一直是艰苦的。在刚进太原的时候，一条盖了五、六年的粗布被子，我总舍不得扔掉它。在十来年的战争环境里，夏天没有穿过袜子，总是穿一双毛毛底鞋。那时，我对资产阶级的生活是深恶痛绝的。所以当我刚进城时，职工群众对我的印象很好。他们说：“从来没有见过这样朴素的局长。”他们经常和我接近。可是在进城以后不久，我的衣服变了，我的思想作风也有些变了。工人说我变了样子，和我接近的也少了。我虽然还没有走上腐化堕落的道路，但已接近了这个边沿。如果反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动再迟一年进行，我的前途将是很危险的。那么，我为什么变得这样快呢？我是怎样受了资产阶级思想侵蚀和影响的呢？
    刚进城时，我有这样两种心情：一种是以胜利者自居；一种是觉得自己革命十多年，又是工人出身，什么也不在乎。因为在思想上失掉了警惕性，失去了无产阶级的战斗精神，就滋长了各种非无产阶级意识，变成了资产阶级“糖弹”射击的靶子。我赞成下面的同志开展思想斗争，但不愿意同志们批评我，更不欢迎同志们对我提出反对意见。总认为自己比别人高明。这就关闭了前进的大门，蒙蔽了自己的眼睛。
    与此同时，自私自利的个人主义也发展了。我从参加工作一直到一九四九年进城后，从没有回家一次。进城那年，父母来看过我。从那以后，我想起了小时父母受苦的情况，就产生了照顾家庭的心理。我哥哥在太原市当铁匠。我刚进城时，他见我生活艰苦，曾给我钱花。一九五零年，他因为没有原料要停工，来交通局找我，我就给了他些方便，介绍他买了局里的一万七千六百五十斤铁架子。一九五一年又介绍他买了交通工厂（属交通局管辖）的一辆胶轮车。这种损公利己的行为，给党和政府造成了极不好的影响。
    在工作和学习上，由于我没有充分认识到新环境下的重大任务，就没有积极学习业务，提高自己的工作能力和政策水平。交通局的干部，百分之九十以上的是留用人员。但对干部政策我却没有很好地研究过一次。直到去年“审干”后，我对干部政策的认识才比较明确了。交通局的业务很复杂，有很多问题牵连到和私商的关系。在这方面也没有进行过认真的研究。认为自己工作了十多年，不会出大漏子，但结果也犯了错误。
    由于我背上了居功自傲的包袱，自由放任，因而逐渐沾染了资产阶级的思想，改变了原来的艰苦朴素的作风。我在这方面的改变，是从爱人问题上开始的。进太原以前，我是有爱人的。但因为她的文化水平低，又爱挑眼，所以结婚不久，两人的感情就不太好。但因为当时是在老解放区，和她离婚的心思还不太强烈。进入太原以后，看到城市里的花花绿绿，又看到许多又漂亮、又有文化的妇女，便下定了离婚的决心。结果重找了一个官僚资产阶级家庭出身的女子（大学生）。因为自己极力地追求她，就采取了迁就逢迎的态度，改变了自己一贯保持着的艰苦朴素作风。在衣食上是越来越讲究了，在经济开支上是越来越“大方”了。有时也感到花钱太多了，但怕和爱人闹坏了感情，也就勉强迁就。特别是有一次她要花八十多万元给我买一身西式制服，引起了我思想上的斗争。一个工人出身的老干部，那里花过这么多钱来买一身衣服呢？心里不高兴，但又不敢反对。这样天长日久，就对这样的事情习以为常了。以致在一九五○年七月时，她为吃冰激凌打了店员，受到人民政府的批评时，我还怜悯她，派秘书到公安局去为她讲情。自己既然不能改造她，而在人民政府教育她时，我还不表示欢迎，这就在思想情绪上脱离了工人阶级的本队，而不知不觉地陷入了资产阶级的泥坑。
    一九四九年以后，我更感到一个局长骑自行车有点“丢人”，便不断地坐汽车。一九五一年时，坐着局里的小汽车也不舒服了，认为这些汽车都是旧式的，便想着买个漂亮的新式小卧车（因太贵没有买）。在一九四九年开干部会时，自己还看不惯那种铺张浪费的大会餐。但一九五○年以后，就感到不会餐是小气的表现了。到了一九五一年，不但每次开会都要会餐，而且大小事都要会餐，认为不会餐就不足以说明事情的重要。因此，机关的开支一年比一年大。一九四九年的开支没有达到预算，一九五○年就超过了预算二千万元，到一九五一年就超过了九千万元。
    在思想上是闹“阔气”、“排场”，在工作上是不深入下层，于是文牍主义和官僚主义的作风就越来越严重。在进城的初期，我经常参加工人的会议，征求工人的意见。但后来感到这太琐碎，没有个大机关的派头。于是在一九五○年便开始制订大而无当的各种制度，一共制订了十来种，订成一个有四十多页的本子，向下推行，一连闹了三、四个月，结果行不通。但是，自己并没有从这里得到教训，以后，就整天坐在办公室里看公文，签名、盖章。这一来就和群众隔离了，只是偏听偏信了。例如一九五○年出卖的呆旧铁料，只是在会议上作了个决定，就任凭宋剑、赵以儒等贪污分子去随便出卖，从未检查过一次。结果就使贪污分子和私商勾结起来，盗卖了我们的好电滚子和电瓶等。一次，贪污分子宋剑问我酒精坏了是不是可以出卖，我也就马马虎虎地答应他可以出卖，一点也没想到这是他们在耍手腕。因为我已经不是站在工人阶级的立场上去观察他们，而是从单纯技术观点出发，肯定他们是好干部，认为他们能说、能写、精干，可以听信。所以在一年多的时间中，就把宋剑提拔成科长，还打算提拔他当副处长。因为对于贪污分子失掉警惕，也就使罪大恶极的贪污分子张韵波逃跑了。
    这种资产阶级思想，表现在经营方法上是唯利是图，没有国家观念。我们出卖废铁时，当时卖给钢铁厂是每斤铁八两米，卖给私商是十二两。我就决定卖给私商。贪污分子宋剑说买木板可以赚钱，我就同意了他的意见。结果，破坏了国家的财政制度。另外，分配给业务处一年上缴七十万斤米的任务，也完全是从追求利润出发的。
    在进城以后，我没有经得起资产阶级思想的进攻，在“糖衣炮弹”面前打了败仗，因而造成了国家财产的巨大损失。这是我的极大错误。我诚恳地接受上级对我的处分。可是，我决不因在资产阶级进攻的面前打了败仗而灰心！在党的正确的领导下，我一定要在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争中，彻底清算自己，拿起马克思列宁主义的武器，重新开始战斗。
