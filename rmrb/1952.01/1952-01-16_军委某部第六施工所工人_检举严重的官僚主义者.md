    Workers of the Sixth Construction Unit of a Certain Department of the Military Commission
    Expose Serious Bureaucrats

    Comrade Editor: The leading cadres of the Sixth Construction Unit of a certain department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission suppress democracy and have serious bureaucratic work styles. We, thirty-nine carpenters, were introduced by the Anshan Labor Introduction Office to the Northeast Veterans Engineering Company at the end of May last year, and then introduced by this company to work at the Sixth Construction Unit. Li Fachun, the director of the Second Work Area of the Construction Unit, did not give us work, and even said, "We'll give you a little work every five days." After that, the Construction Unit paid us 75% of our salary of 20,000 yuan per day. We really didn't want to take wages for nothing, so we asked to go to other work areas to work. The leading cadres of the Construction Unit said, "We would rather let you rest and take wages than let you work in other construction units." And they threatened us by saying, "Whoever dares to go out is running away." Soon, we learned that the Construction Unit had more than 3,100 square meters of carpentry work, so we requested the Construction Unit to give us the work at a wage of 16,000 yuan per square meter. But they still let us rest and contracted the project to the foreman Jiang Yongchun, with a wage of 25,000 yuan per square meter. In this way, the Construction Unit wasted more than 50 million yuan in wage differences and giving us wages for nothing. We thirty-nine people could not bear to waste state funds any longer, so we signed our names together and asked the Construction Unit to allocate work again. On July 20th, Guo Guangrong, the director of the Construction Unit, summoned us to speak: "Your actions are the work style of workers in the Kuomintang era. Who led the signing of opinions? Whoever has opinions, come into the room to talk!" We were so scared that we didn't dare to say a word. The cadres of the Xijiao Working Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions asked us to send representatives to negotiate with the Construction Unit. We elected Gu Maoshun as our representative. Because Gu Maoshun was serious in his work, he angered Director Hu of the Construction Unit's trade union. Director Hu insisted that Gu had said "the Construction Unit's trade union is the trade union of Taiwan," and forced Gu to confess and repent. After Gu was forced to admit it, he was afraid of further trouble, so he used a fake family letter saying that his child had died as an excuse to ask for leave and escape back to his hometown in Northeast China. Many of our workers have escaped back home using this method. Once, the Construction Unit had an urgent task of moving bricks, and the leading cadres forced us to do it, saying:
    "Whoever doesn't move bricks is on strike." But the wages they paid were not the wages for carpentry work. Guo Guangrong, the director of the Construction Unit, stays in the city all day and rarely comes to the construction site. Now, we are exposing the serious bureaucracy of the leading cadres of the Construction Unit and their deliberate waste of state funds, and we ask the relevant departments to deal with it quickly.

    军委某部第六施工所工人
    检举严重的官僚主义者
    编辑同志：人民革命军事委员会某部第六施工所领导干部压制民主，有严重的官僚主义作风。我们三十九个木工，自去年五月底经鞍山劳动介绍所介绍到东北荣军工程公司，再由这个公司介绍到第六施工所工作。施工所第二工区主任李发春不给我们活做，还说：“每隔五天给你们一点活做。”之后，施工所每天按工资两万元的七五折发给我们。我们实在不愿意不做活白拿工资，就要求到其他工区去干活。施工所领导干部说：“宁可让你们休息拿工资，也不能叫你们到别的施工单位工作。”并且用“谁敢出去谁就是逃跑”的话来威胁我们。不久，我们知道施工所有三千一百多平方米的木工活，就向施工所请求以每平方米一万六千元的工资给我们做。但他们还是让我们休息，把工程包给大把头姜永春，每平方米的工资为二万五千元。这样，施工所在工资差额和白给我们工资方面，共浪费了五千多万元。我们三十九人不忍再浪费国家资金，就一块签名再度要施工所分配工作。七月二十日，施工所主任郭光荣召集我们讲话：“你们这种举动是国民党时代的工人的作风，签名提意见是谁领导的？谁有意见到屋里来谈！”吓得我们不敢说一句话。北京市总工会西郊工作委员会的干部要我们派代表和施工所交涉。我们选出谷茂顺为代表。由于谷茂顺办事认真，竟惹恼了施工所工会胡主任。胡主任硬说谷说过“施工所工会是台湾的工会”，强迫谷坦白悔过。谷被迫承认后，怕再找他的麻烦，就以家里小孩病死的假家信为藉口，请假逃回东北老家。我们工人里面采取这个方法逃回的很多。有一次，施工所有一项搬运砖头的紧急任务，领导干部强迫我们去做，并说：
    “谁不搬砖，谁就是罢工。”但他们发的工资却不依木工工资发。施工所主任郭光荣终日在城里，也很少来工地。现在，我们揭露施工所领导干部的严重官僚主义以及他们故意浪费国家资财的事实，请有关部门迅速处理。
