    "Rapid Literacy Method" Teaching Principles Worthy of Attention by All Language Teachers
    Editor: The "Rapid Literacy Method" of Qi Jianhua is something worthy of attention. His teaching principles should arouse the attention of all language teachers. I believe his teaching method is applicable to literacy teaching for eliminating illiteracy. Because: First, it determines the teaching content and teaching methods according to the specific circumstances of the students. According to his principles, teaching Chinese should not be bound by conventions, but should be boldly creative based on the target audience. Second, based on the characteristics of the language being taught, he adopts the method of concentrating efforts, breaking through difficulties, and increasing learning confidence, instead of forcing students to learn everything comprehensively at the same time, which would be protracted and lead to loss of confidence. This may not be suitable for children, but it is effective for older people. The situation of young people and adults learning a language is: on the one hand, there is an urgent need, and on the other hand, it is easy to lose confidence; on the other hand, they often already understand the content they are learning, and only need to break through the barrier of writing. Therefore, it is a good method to first use a blitz approach so that they can apply the learned writing to reading in a very short period of time. Third, he emphasizes reading extensively and consolidating what he has learned through practical application, instead of being constrained by nitpicking and in-depth study of so-called intensive reading. I believe that everyone who has learned a language can admit that extensive reading is an important way to learn a language, and simply sticking to textbooks and chewing on them is not a good way to learn (of course, this is not to belittle the role of intensive reading). At present, there is a fairly common shortcoming in the teaching of Chinese and foreign languages in universities and middle schools, that is, the combination of in-class and extracurricular reading materials (including newspapers and magazines) is not given equal importance. I think that students who are able to read with difficulty should read as widely as possible, and teachers should also provide sufficient guidance. Without the guerrilla warfare of extensive reading, the base of intensive reading is difficult to consolidate. Guided extensive reading can not only satisfy young people's desire for knowledge, but also cultivate their reading ability. I also feel that the above-mentioned principles may not only be applicable to language teaching, but also have reference value for the teaching of historical science and social science. If our teaching can break the rules and adopt a materialistic and revolutionary development perspective, teaching efficiency will definitely be rapidly improved, and the talents urgently needed by the country can be cultivated more quickly.

### “速成识字法”的教学原则值得所有语文教师重视

    “速成识字法”的教学原则值得所有语文教师重视
    编辑同志：祁建华“速成识字法”，是一件值得注意的事。他的教学原则，应该引起所有语文教师的重视。我认为他的教学法是适用于扫除文盲的识字教学的。因为：第一，它根据学生的具体情况，决定教学内容和教学方法。按照他的原则，教语文不应墨守成规，而应依据对象大胆创造。第二，他根据所教的语文的特点，采取集中力量，突破困难点，增加学习信心的办法，而不勉强要求学生同时全面学会，以致旷日持久，失掉信心。这对于儿童或者不相宜，但对于年纪较大的人是有效的。青年和成年学习语文的情况是：一则有迫切要求，同时又容易失去自信；二则对所学内容往往已经了解，只要求打破文字障碍。所以先用突击方法，使他们在很短时间内就能应用学会的文字去读书，是很好的办法。第三，他注重大量读书，从实际应用中巩固所学，而不拘束于咬文嚼字、深入钻研的所谓精读。我相信所有学会一种语文的人都能承认，多多益善的博览是学习语文的重要途径，而仅仅抱着课本咬嚼是学不好的（当然这并不是要轻视精读的作用）。目前大学和中学里对中外语文的教学，有一个相当普遍的缺点，就是没有把课内课外读物（包括报纸杂志）结合起来，加以同等重视。我以为到了能勉强看书的程度的学生要尽可能地博览群书，而先生也要加以足够的领导。如果没有泛览的游击战，精读的根据地是很难巩固的。有领导地广泛阅读，不但能够满足青年的求知欲，并且能够培养他们的阅读能力。我还觉得，以上所说的几点原则，可能不只适用于语文教学，对于历史科学、社会科学的教学也有参考的价值。如果我们的教学都能打破例规，采取唯物的和革命的发展观点，教学效率必定能够迅速提高，而国家所迫切需要的人材也就可以更快培养出来。  金克木
