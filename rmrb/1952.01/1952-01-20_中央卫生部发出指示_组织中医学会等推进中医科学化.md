    中央卫生部发出指示
    组织中医学会等推进中医科学化
    为了加强中西医的团结和推进中医科学化，去年十二月二十九日中央人民政府卫生部发出“关于组织中医学会的指示”与“关于组织中医进修学校及进修班的规定”。
    指示要求各地成立群众性的中医学术团体。指示指出：中医学会的首要任务是促进中医科学化与密切中西医的团结。因此中医学会应该是中西医团结的桥梁和中医进修的领导者和组织者。此外应遵照卫生工作的总方针，发动会员参加国家卫生建设；并担负研究与改进中医药学术的任务。
    同时为了统一过去一年来各地中医进修学校和进修班的组织及课程标准，中央人民政府卫生部另颁发了关于组织中医进修学校及进修班的规定。
