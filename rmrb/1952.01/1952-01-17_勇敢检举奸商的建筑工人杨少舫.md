    Yang Shao-fang is a technical worker in the construction industry in Nanjing. Unaffected by the threats and inducements of unscrupulous merchants, he bravely exposed the illegal activities of unscrupulous merchants stealing state property. As a result, he was commended by a certain engineering department of the East China Military Region and the Nanjing Municipal People's Government.

    Yang Shao-fang used to work in the privately owned Yongshun Construction Factory in Nanjing. The factory owner, Chen Wenda, was a philistine rogue. Relying on an empty signboard, a boastful mouth, and a set of despicable bribery skills, he stole state property while contracting national construction projects. In the winter of 1950, when Chen Wenda contracted a batch of barbed wire for a public factory, he bribed Zhang Linfeng, the cadre in charge of the project, with 200,000 yuan, using old iron wire coated with silver powder to impersonate good iron wire, thereby obtaining huge profits. The leading cadres of this public factory did not inspect the project and blindly listened to Chen Wenda's sweet talk. After the completion of the project, they even published a commendation notice in the local newspaper. Chen Wenda used this notice as capital to infiltrate the national defense construction department and contract many projects. In contracting these projects, he used more than forty methods of cutting corners and stealing materials, unscrupulously stealing state property.

    This shameless theft by the unscrupulous merchant Chen Wenda aroused Yang Shao-fang's righteous indignation. He warned Chen Wenda several times, saying, "What you are doing is letting the country down. The truth will eventually come out one day. Then we'll see what happens to you." However, the unscrupulous merchant, blinded by greed, not only did not repent but also scolded Yang Shao-fang, telling him to just do his job honestly and not interfere in "other people's business," and threatened him with dismissal. But Yang Shao-fang was not intimidated by the unscrupulous merchant's threats. When contracting a certain project for the East China Military Region, Chen Wenda used sweet talk and the commendation notice published in the newspaper by a certain public factory to deceive Zhou Fanyu, the section chief in charge of the project, and even more recklessly cut corners and stole materials. Yang Shao-fang couldn't bear it anymore. He reported Chen Wenda's crimes to the supervising cadres twice in a row, but when this supervising cadre reported the situation to Section Chief Zhou Fanyu, Zhou Fanyu actually said, "Don't listen to what the common people say." Even more absurd was that after the completion of the project, Zhou Fanyu, without the permission of his superiors, took it upon himself to hold a grand "celebration banquet." The unscrupulous merchant Chen Wenda was awarded a "second prize," receiving a certificate of merit and a banner with the words "Conscientious and Responsible" written on it. Since then, Chen Wenda's audacity grew, and in contracting several other projects for the department, he disregarded the interests of the state, reducing the amount of cement used in the concrete by half and cutting corners when building the foundations, completely disregarding the contract. He openly said to the workers, "Section Chief Zhou is so good to us, we have to make a big profit off of him." Yang Shao-fang was very angry about this situation. He wanted to talk to the responsible comrades in the engineering department, but was blocked by bureaucrats and could not see them. Although the engineering department made a "sudden" inspection, it was only a cursory look, and they were deceived by the unscrupulous merchant's sweet talk. Yang Shao-fang was extremely angry. He said to a cadre, "Comrade! You are too naive. The devil is right in front of you, but you can't see it." But even this did not attract the attention of the bureaucratic leaders. Chen Wenda knew that Yang Shao-fang was exposing him, so he cursed Yang Shao-fang as a "traitor" in front of other workers, reduced his salary, demoted him to burning the boiler and sweeping the floor, and finally simply fired him.

    Although Yang Shao-fang lost his job because of the report, he was not discouraged. He felt that he was right. After watching the movie "Liu Hulan," his fighting will became even stronger. He thought: She was a girl who grew up in the countryside and worked for the revolution regardless of life and death. We, the working class, are the masters of the country, how can we stand idly by while unscrupulous merchants harm the country? He also filed a report with the construction industry union. But the union cadres felt that the situation was complicated and were unwilling to intervene. He went five times, and each time he got no results. At this time, Chen Wenda hated him to the bone and attacked him everywhere. Yang Shao-fang found a job in the construction industry guild. Chen Wenda found out and went to make a scene, saying, "I am a standing committee member of the guild. Our boss's guild cannot let someone named Yang in." So Yang Shao-fang lost his job again. A friend introduced him to a construction site outside the city in another private construction factory. Before leaving, his friend specially instructed him: The previous report had no effect, so be patient in the future and don't stand out, lest Chen Wenda find out and cause trouble again. But Yang Shao-fang did not become discouraged. He became more active and responsible in his work, and was loved by other workers. Soon, he was elected as the deputy leader of the first district work group of the construction workers' union. When the unscrupulous merchant Chen Wenda found out, he patted his chest and said, "If that kid can squat there for three months, I'm not a man." In addition to continuing to find ways to attack Yang Shao-fang, he also set up a trap, trying to lure Yang Shao-fang into submission. Chen Wenda specially organized a banquet for Yang Shao-fang and sent someone to invite him unsuccessfully. Chen Wenda went to invite him himself, hinting that the past could be "forgiven." But these threats and inducements did not shake Yang Shao-fang's position of justice. Seeing that his tricks were not working, and that the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy had already begun in full swing, Chen Wenda felt panicked. So he used another despicable method to divide the workers. He increased the wages of all the workers in the Yongshun Construction Factory who were close to Yang Shao-fang and promoted Chen Xinming, an apprentice who was particularly close to Yang Shao-fang, telling them not to follow Yang Shao-fang. These conspiracies and tricks were ruthlessly exposed by the workers, and no one accepted his inducements. At this time, Yang Shao-fang exposed another unscrupulous merchant's theft of state property in a certain construction project outside the city, and received the support of the Communist Party members in the department. They also actively encouraged Yang Shao-fang to continue to fight against the unscrupulous merchant Chen Wenda. This increased Yang Shao-fang's courage a hundredfold. Regardless of the wind and rain, he took advantage of the work breaks to run twenty or thirty li from outside the city to the city five times to report to the General Trade Union and the Municipal People's Procuratorate, which attracted the attention of relevant departments. Relevant departments immediately organized an inspection team to re-examine the various projects previously contracted by the unscrupulous merchant Chen Wenda. The results proved that there were serious cases of cutting corners and stealing materials in every project, and the state suffered huge losses. Now the unscrupulous merchant Chen Wenda and all the corrupt and derelict cadres in relevant departments have been dealt with separately by the Municipal People's Procuratorate and relevant departments.

    Yang Shao-fang's unyielding struggle has been commended by a certain engineering department of the East China Military Region and the Nanjing Municipal People's Government. Ke Qingshi, the Mayor of Nanjing, also called on the city's workers at the People's Representative Conference to learn from Yang Shao-fang's heroic and unyielding spirit of protecting state property.

    勇敢检举奸商的建筑工人杨少舫
    新华社记者　魏文华
    杨少舫是南京市营造业的一个技术工人。他不受奸商的威胁利诱，勇敢地揭发了奸商盗窃国家财产的不法行为，因此受到华东军区某工程部门和南京市人民政府的表扬。
    杨少舫曾在南京私营永顺营造厂做工。这个厂的老板陈文达是一个市侩流氓，他凭一面空招牌、一张能吹嘘的嘴和一套卑劣的行贿本领，在承包国家建设工程中偷窃国家财产。一九五零年冬陈文达承包公营某厂的一批钢刺网时，向负责工程的干部张林峰行贿二十万元，用涂过银粉的旧铁刺冒充好铁刺，从中获取巨额暴利。这个公营厂的领导干部对工程不加检查，盲目地听信陈文达的花言巧语，在工程完毕后竟在当地报纸上登了表扬他的启事。陈文达就拿了这个启事做资本，混入国防建设部门承包了许多工程。他在包工中利用四十多种偷工减料的方法，肆无忌惮地盗窃国家财产。
    奸商陈文达的这种无耻的盗窃行为，激起了杨少舫的义愤，他几次警告陈文达说：“你这样做是对不起国家的，事情总有水落石出的一天，到那时看你如何下场。”可是奸商利欲薰心，不但不痛加改悔，反而把杨少舫大骂一顿，要他只管老实做工，休管“闲事”，并用解雇来威胁他。但杨少舫并没有被奸商的威胁吓退。在承包华东军区某项工程时，陈文达用花言巧语和某公营工厂在报上登的表扬他的启事，骗住了负责工程的科长周番宇，更加放肆地偷工减料。杨少舫实在忍不住了，他连续两次向监工干部揭发陈文达的罪行，但是当这个监工干部把这些情况报告给科长周番宇时，周番宇竟说：“老百姓的话不要听它。”更荒谬的是：当工程完毕后，周番宇未得上级允许，自作主张大摆“庆功宴”，奸商陈文达被评为“二等奖”，得到了一份奖状和一面写着“认真负责”四个字的锦旗。从此，陈文达的贼胆越来越大，在承包该部另外的几项工程中，不顾国家利益，把混凝土所用的洋灰量减少一半，打墙基时也偷工，把合同完全置之脑后。他公然对工人们说：“周科长这么好，我们要大大捞他一笔。”杨少舫对这种情形非常气愤，他想找工程部门的负责同志谈，但被官僚主义者挡住去路，无法见到。工程部门虽然去“突击”检查了一次，但只是草率地看了一遍，被奸商用几句好话说得迷了心窍。杨少舫极为愤怒，他对一个干部说：“同志！你们太老实了，鬼在眼前，你们却看不到。”但是这样还是没有引起官僚主义领导者的注意。陈文达知道杨少舫在揭发他，便当着其他工人的面骂杨少舫是“内奸”，把他的薪水减低，在工作上把他降级调去烧锅扫地，最后索性把他解雇了。
    杨少舫虽然因检举而失业，但是他并不气馁，他觉得自己是对的。当他看了电影“刘胡兰”以后，斗争意志更加坚定。他想：人家是一个生长在农村里的女孩子，不顾生死为革命工作，我们工人阶级是国家主人，怎能对奸商危害国家的行为袖手旁观呢？他又向建筑业工会提出检举。但工会干部觉得情节复杂，不愿过问，他先后去了五次，五次都得不到结果。这时陈文达把他恨透了，到处打击他。杨少舫在营造业公会找到了一个工作，陈文达知道后跑去大闹说：“我是公会的常务委员，我们老板的公会不能叫姓杨的钻进来。”于是杨少舫又失了业。朋友介绍他到另外一家私营营造厂在城外的一处工地上去做工，临走时朋友特别嘱咐他说：过去检举没有效果，以后忍耐一点，不要出头露面，免得被陈文达发现了又闹出事来。但杨少舫并没有消沉下去，他在工作中更加积极负责，受到其他工人的爱戴，不久，他被选为修筑业工会第一区工作组的副组长。奸商陈文达知道后，拍拍胸脯说：“他小子在那里能蹲三个月，我不见人。”他除了继续想法打击杨少舫外，同时布设骗局，想利诱杨少舫屈服。陈文达特为杨少舫办了一台酒席，派人去请不成功，陈文达亲自去请，暗示过去的事都可以“谅解”。可是这些威吓利诱都没有动摇杨少舫的正义立场。陈文达见诡计不逞，而反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已经轰轰烈烈地展开，大感恐慌，于是他又用出另一个卑劣手段来分化工人，他把永顺营造厂中凡接近杨少舫的工人一律增加工资，并提升特别亲近杨少舫的学徒陈信铭，要他们不要跟着杨少舫跑。这些阴谋诡计被工人们无情地揭穿，大家都不接受他的利诱。这时候，杨少舫在城外某部建筑工程中揭发了另一个奸商盗窃国家财产的行为，得到该部共产党员的支持，他们并积极鼓励杨少舫继续向奸商陈文达作斗争。这使杨少舫的斗争勇气百倍增加，他不顾风雨，乘歇工的机会五次从城外跑二三十里路进城到总工会及市人民检察署检举，引起各有关部门的注意。各有关部门立即组织检查组复查奸商陈文达以前所包的各项工程，结果证明每一次工程都有严重的偷工减料情形，国家受到巨大损失。现在奸商陈文达和所有有关部门的贪污渎职干部都已由市人民检察署和有关部门分别予以处理。
    杨少舫不屈不挠的斗争，受到华东军区某工程部门和南京市人民政府的表扬。南京市人民政府市长柯庆施并在各界人民代表会议上号召全市工人学习杨少舫爱护国家财产的英勇不屈的斗争精神。
