    Bureaucratic Work Style of Leading Cadres of Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company Causes Disastrous Consequences
    Embezzlement and Wasteful Incidents Emerge One After Another, Losses Exceed 7 Billion Yuan
    Deputy Director of Shandong Provincial Department of Industry and General Manager of Construction Engineering Company Both Removed from Their Posts
    All Embezzling Criminals Will Be Punished by the Shandong Provincial People's Court According to Law
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Due to the serious bureaucratic work style of leading cadres, the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company has continuously experienced massive embezzlement and waste, resulting in a loss of 7,190 million yuan in state property. A total of forty-two individuals, including procurement personnel, engineering staff, and car drivers, have engaged in corrupt activities. After eight months of repeated investigation, the Shandong Provincial People's Procuratorate has clarified all the facts of the case and filed a public prosecution with the Shandong Provincial People's Court.
    Among these embezzlers, the largest offenders are Chi Qi, Deputy Chief of the Procurement Section, and Wang Xilian and Han Mingqi, procurement personnel. They embezzled and accepted bribes during procurement and misappropriated large amounts of public funds, colluding with unscrupulous merchants to engage in speculative business.
    In July 1950, when Chi Qi, Deputy Chief of the Procurement Section, was sent to Tianjin, Northeast China, and other places to purchase timber, he accepted bribes from Yonghua Timber Company, a private merchant in Tianjin, and ordered 1,943 cubic meters of timber from Yonghua Timber Company at a price of 210,000 yuan per cubic meter above the market price. This timber was not in Tianjin but in Northeast China; thus, including freight, the total loss to the state was 499.9 million yuan, at a cost of 660,000 yuan per cubic meter. Through Yonghua Timber Company's connections, Chi Qi also became acquainted with Xiao Naisheng, a speculative merchant who bought and sold short, and accepted gifts such as ginseng and deer antler paste. The first time Chi Qi bought timber from Xiao Naisheng, the price was 400,000 yuan per cubic meter above the market price at the time; buying 250 cubic meters resulted in a loss of 100 million yuan to the public. The second time he ordered timber from Xiao Naisheng, he paid in advance without seeing the timber, resulting in Xiao Naisheng swindling him out of more than 405.26 million yuan.
    Chi Qi took out more than 5 billion yuan in public funds to purchase timber in Tianjin, Northeast China, and other places. After arriving in Northeast China, he deposited most of the public funds in Hongsheng Oil Shop, a private merchant in Shenyang (the manager of this oil shop was Chi Qi's cousin), allowing Hongsheng Oil Shop to use these public funds to engage in speculation. He spent the bribes given to him by private merchants at will in Northeast China. In Jilin, he often went to eat, drink, and play with Xiao Naisheng in the Xiaobeishan scenic area of Jilin City. Instead of completing his procurement tasks, Chi Qi took prostitutes to Dalian. In Dalian, he stayed in the best hotels, used public funds to buy fur coats for prostitutes, indulged in extravagance, and called himself "a big merchant from Yantai." In addition, Chi Qi also misappropriated a total of 269.25 million yuan in public funds.
    Wang Xilian, a procurement employee, frequently accepted gifts from private merchants and indulged in lavish meals with them in Jilin City, Northeast China. Before Xiao Naisheng, a criminal merchant, fled with the money, the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company already knew the news. However, when Wang Xilian was asked, he pretended not to know and did not disclose Xiao Naisheng's address at the time. Under Wang Xilian's cover, Xiao Naisheng calmly absconded with the money (he has now been captured). Before Xiao Naisheng fled, Wang Xilian had also privately lent Xiao Naisheng 9.4 million yuan. The main reason Wang Xilian protected Xiao Naisheng was because Xiao Naisheng often gave him gifts; in just one instance that is already known, he gave him 3 million yuan. Wang Xilian often interacted with Zhou Jichang, a private merchant at the Xinhua Hotel in Jilin, and deposited 31.1 million yuan of public funds in the Xinhua Hotel, enabling the Xinhua Hotel to use it for speculative activities. In addition, Wang Xilian also misappropriated 162.5 million yuan in public funds.
    During the procurement period in Northeast China, procurement employee Han Mingqi colluded with private merchant Liu Yanbo to embezzle and engage in fraudulent practices. Han Mingqi ordered 400 meters of new timber from Liu Yanbo, paying 130 million yuan in advance, which resulted in Liu Yanbo defrauding them of the entire amount. Han Mingqi also privately lent Huamei Hotel in Harbin one wagon and 5 million yuan in public funds. To satisfy his personal desires, he even sent a rogue named Hu Tingzhen, pretending to be a staff member of the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company stationed in the Northeast, to the Qiqihar Railway Bureau's business office to book 1,256 wagons, taking advantage of the railway transportation control period at the time to sell them to private merchants at high prices for business (booking wagons at 300,000 yuan each and selling them to private merchants at 1.2 million yuan each). The speculative incident was stopped after it was detected by the Railway Bureau. It has now been ascertained that Han Mingqi misappropriated a total of 1,131.8 million yuan in public funds.
    When purchasing roofing felt in Shanghai, procurement employee Zhang Renzheng caused a loss of more than 68.6 million yuan to the public because he accepted bribes from private merchants, with the price per roll of roofing felt exceeding the market price by 260,000 to 320,000 yuan. Moreover, all the roofing felt purchased was unusable.
    More than 30 engineering staff members of this construction engineering company, including Diao Chengyu, Lan Ziping, and Wang Cizhong, also embezzled more than 99.9 million yuan by colluding with foremen, deducting workers' wages, and stealing construction materials.
    In the two years of 1950 and 1951, a total of 28 rework projects were carried out due to inadequate planning, poor construction, or cutting corners, resulting in a loss of more than 4,715.9 million yuan. According to preliminary statistics, a certain project that began in August 1951 alone wasted more than 2,723.72 million yuan.
    The company's institutional waste is also very serious. According to statistics from January to September of last year alone, more than 478.42 million yuan was wasted. Among them, postal and telecommunications, car repairs, gasoline consumption, hospitality, and office expenses exceeded the budget by more than 132.66 million yuan; gifts given to various agencies totaled more than 10.8 million yuan; the Department of Industry "skimmed" more than 275.029 million yuan (the company built a large dining hall and repaired houses for the Department of Industry, but the Department of Industry did not pay for it). Dai Qihua, the general manager of this company, and Li Nianzhen, the deputy general manager, lived extravagantly and wastefully, costing 21.5 million yuan. The bathroom renovation costs for Dai Qihua alone amounted to 4.5 million yuan. Other items such as platforms, handrails, flower stands, and fish ponds for private dormitories cost a total of 7.2 million yuan. An "Eighteen Arhats" bed purchased from Boshan cost 800,000 yuan. The interior furniture of Li Nianzhen's dormitory alone was worth 9 million yuan. Just one large wardrobe cost 3 million yuan. Dai Qihua, the general manager of the company, also accepted gifts from private merchants and blindly trusted private merchants, and was defrauded of 600 million yuan by Dong Bochuan, a private merchant (Dong Bochuan said he had timber; Dai Qihua paid him without receiving the goods, leading to the deception).
    In order to uphold the law and discipline and ensure the smooth progress of national construction work, the Shandong Provincial People's Procuratorate has filed public prosecutions against all the criminal embezzlers and handed them over to the Shandong Provincial People's Court for sentencing according to law. For those who have neglected their duties, the Shandong Provincial People's Government has announced a warning to Feng Ping, Director of the Department of Industry, a dismissal to Wang Jiwu, Deputy Director of the Department of Industry, and a dismissal for investigation to Dai Qihua, General Manager of the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company, and Li Nianzhen and Zhang Guishi, Deputy General Managers. Some cadres who adhere to the truth and fight against those who embezzle, waste, and practice bureaucracy will be commended and encouraged.

    山东省建筑工程公司领导干部的官僚主义作风造成恶果
    贪污浪费事件层出损失七十多亿元
    山东省工业厅副厅长和建筑工程公司总经理都已被撤职
    全部贪污罪犯将由山东省人民法院依法惩处
    【本报讯】山东省建筑工程公司因领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，不断发生巨大的贪污浪费事件，使国家财产损失了七十一亿九千多万元。有贪污行为的人员，包括采购人员、工程人员、汽车司机等，总共四十二人。山东省人民检察署八个月来反复检查，已把全部案情弄清，向山东省人民法院提起公诉。
    这些贪污人员中最大的贪污分子是采购股副股长迟岐、采购员王希连、韩鸣岐等。他们在采购中贪污受贿，并大量挪用公款，勾结奸商做投机生意。
    一九五○年七月，采购股副股长迟岐被派到天津、东北等地购买木材时，他在天津曾接受私商永华木行的贿赂，每立方公尺用高出市价二十一万元的价格订购永华木行一千九百四十三立方公尺木材。这些木材并不在天津，而是在东北；这样，连运费合计每立方公尺木材六十六万元，总共使国家损失了四亿九千九百多万元。迟岐通过永华木行的关系，又结识了买空卖空的奸商萧乃生，并接受人参、鹿茸膏等礼物。迟岐在第一次买萧乃生的木材时，每立方公尺高出当时市价四十万元；买了二百五十立方公尺，使公家损失一亿元。第二次订购萧乃生的木材时，没有见木材，就先把款付出，结果被萧乃生骗走四亿零五百二十六万多元。
    迟岐到天津、东北等地购买木材，共带出公款五十多亿元。他到东北后，把大部公款存放在沈阳市私商宏生油行（这个油行的经理是迟岐的表叔），使宏生油行得以利用这些公款做投机生意。他用私商送给他的贿款，在东北任意挥霍。在吉林时，经常和萧乃生一起到吉林市风景区小北山一带吃喝玩乐。迟岐不是完成采购任务，他带着妓女跑到大连。在大连时住在最好的旅馆里，用公款给妓女买皮大衣等，挥霍享用，自称为“烟台的大商人”。此外，迟岐并私自挪用公款共计二亿六千九百二十五万元。
    采购员王希连，在东北吉林市经常接受私商礼物，和私商一起大吃大喝。奸商萧乃生拐款逃跑之前，山东省建筑工程公司已经知道了消息。但问王希连时，他却装不知道，也不说萧乃生当时的地址。在王希连掩护下，萧乃生从容拐款潜逃（现已被捕获）。在萧乃生逃走之前，王希连还私自借给萧乃生九百四十万元。王希连包庇萧乃生的主要原因，是因为萧犯经常给他送礼；仅大家已知道的一次，就送了他三百万元。王希连在吉林常和新华旅社的私商周继昌来往，并把三千一百万元公款存在新华旅社，使新华旅社用来进行投机活动。此外，王希连还挪用公款一亿六千二百五十万元。
    采购员韩鸣岐在东北采购期间，和私商刘彦博勾结在一起，贪污舞弊。韩鸣岐向刘彦博订购四百公尺新木材，事先付款一亿三千万元，结果全部被刘彦博骗走。韩鸣岐还私自借给哈尔滨市华美旅馆车皮一个、公款五百万元。他为了满足自己的私欲，更派了一个叫胡庭珍的流氓，假装是山东省建筑工程公司驻东北区的工作人员，到齐齐哈尔铁路局营业所预订车皮一千二百五十六个，趁当时铁路运输正在管制时期，高价卖给私商作生意（订购车皮每个三十万元，卖给私商每个一百二十万元）。后经铁路局察觉，才把这一投机事件制止。现在已经查明的，韩鸣岐共挪用公款十一亿三千一百八十万元。
    采购员张仁政在上海购买油毛毡时，因为接受私商贿赂，每卷油毛毡的价格超出市价二十六万元到三十二万元，使公家损失六千八百六十多万元。而且买的都是不能用的坏毡。
    这个建筑工程公司的工程人员刁澄宇、蓝子平、王次仲等三十多人，也用勾结工头、克扣工人工资，偷盗建筑器材等办法，贪污九千九百九十多万元。
    一九五○年、一九五一年二年中间，因为工程中计划不周，施工不良或偷工减料，共返工二十八处，损失人民币四十七亿一千五百九十多万元。仅一九五一年八月份开始的某项工程，据初步统计，共浪费二十七亿二千三百七十二万多元。
    这个公司的机关浪费，也是很严重的。仅据去年一月到九月的统计，就浪费了四亿七千八百四十二万多元。其中邮电、汽车修理、汽油耗费、招待、办公用费等共超支一亿三千二百六十六万多元；给各机关送礼物共一千零八十万余元；工业厅“揩油”二亿七千五百零二万九千多元（公司给工业厅建设大饭厅、修理房子等，工业厅没有给钱）。这个公司的戴启华总经理和李念珍副总经理生活上铺张浪费二千一百五十万元。其中仅戴启华的浴室装修费，就用了四百五十万元。其它如私人宿舍的平台、扶梯、花台、鱼池等，共用七百二十万元。从博山买来一个“十八罗汉”床，用了八十万元。李念珍宿舍内部家具装置共值九百万元。仅一个大衣橱就用了三百万元。公司总经理戴启华并因接受私商礼物，盲目相信私商，被私商董伯川骗去六亿元
    （董伯川说他自己有木材；戴启华没有接货，就把款付给他，以至受骗）。
    山东省人民检察署为了维护法纪、保障国家建设工作的顺利进行，对所有犯法的贪污分子提起公诉，交山东省人民法院依法判处。对于失职人员，山东省人民政府已宣布给工业厅厅长冯平以警告处分，给工业厅副厅长王纪武以撤职处分，给山东省建筑工程公司总经理戴启华、副总经理李念珍、张贵时以撤职查办的处分。坚持真理，对贪污浪费者官僚主义者进行斗争的一些干部将受到表扬和鼓励。
