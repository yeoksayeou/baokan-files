    The Beijing Tax Bureau held an anti-corruption struggle meeting on the 9th, attended by more than 1,200 staff members of the Beijing Tax Bureau and more than 100 representatives from the Beijing business community and various financial and economic departments of the city. At the meeting, tax officials exposed the crimes of corrupt elements Cui Yaoting, Lü Zhongbo, Zhao Yushan, Zhu Junxi, Wu Peiran and others who colluded with private merchants, refused to confess, and prevented others from confessing and reporting. Everyone unanimously demanded that the government immediately arrest these corrupt elements. Cheng Hongyi, Director of the Beijing Tax Bureau, accepted everyone's request on the spot and announced on behalf of the government that Cui Yaoting, Lü Zhongbo, Zhao Yushan, Zhu Junxi, Wu Peiran and other five corrupt elements who refused to confess would be handed over to the People's Court for punishment according to law. These five corrupt elements have consistently colluded with illegal private merchants to embezzle and evade taxes, causing great losses to the country. In this anti-corruption campaign of the tax bureau, not only did they not confess themselves, but they also prevented others from confessing. For example, the corrupt element Cui Yaoting, as the chief of the direct tax section of the Ninth Branch Bureau, is known to have embezzled more than six million yuan in bribes. He shielded a private merchant from evading taxes once for more than five million yuan. In this anti-corruption campaign, he used various methods to collude with private merchants, cover up for each other, refused to confess, and used various methods to threaten those who reported him. The corrupt element Lü Zhongbo was a special agent before liberation. In this anti-corruption campaign, not only did he not confess properly, but he also prevented seven corrupt elements from confessing, adopting a completely resistant attitude towards the movement. Another example is the corrupt element Zhao Yushan, who is a habitual corrupt person. Despite repeated education and leniency from the People's Government, he has shown no remorse. When the tax bureau launched the anti-corruption campaign, everyone initially hoped that they would confess voluntarily and repent their past mistakes; but after repeated mobilization by the leadership and everyone, not only did they not know how to repent, but they also undermined the development of the movement, arousing the indignation of all tax officials. Therefore, when Cheng Hongyi, Director of the Tax Bureau, announced that he would accept everyone's request and hand over these five corrupt elements to the People's Court for punishment according to law, everyone expressed their warm support. Many cadres spoke and unanimously agreed that the People's Government should arrest and punish corrupt elements who refuse to confess, and expressed great hatred for corrupt elements.

    At the meeting, Cui Jingbo, Deputy Director of the National Tax Administration, pointed out to all tax officials in Beijing that although the Beijing Tax Bureau's movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has been launched and has achieved great results, this is only the beginning of the movement. In the future, it must be further deepened to completely eliminate corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. At the end of the meeting, Cheng Hongyi, Director of the Beijing Tax Bureau, spoke, calling on all staff members of the Beijing Tax Bureau to mobilize more vigorously, actively launch a reporting campaign, and boldly expose the crimes of corrupt and bribe-taking elements and illegal businessmen bribing and evading taxes. He said: Corrupt elements should confess quickly and thoroughly. Only through thorough confession can they receive lenient treatment from the people.

    北京市税务局举行反贪污斗争大会
    贪污分子崔耀庭等拒不坦白已被逮捕
    程宏毅局长号召大胆检举贪污受贿分子和不法商人行贿漏税的罪行
    北京市税务局九日举行反贪污斗争大会，到会的有北京市税务局工作人员一千二百多人和北京市工商界代表、市财经各部门代表百余人。在这次大会上，税务工作人员纷纷揭发贪污分子崔耀庭、吕钟伯、赵玉山、朱濬溪、吴沛然等和私商勾结拒不坦白并阻止别人坦白检举的罪行。大家一致要求政府立即逮捕这些贪污分子。北京市税务局局长程宏毅当场接受大家的要求，代表政府宣布把崔耀庭、吕钟伯、赵玉山、朱濬溪、吴沛然等五个拒不坦白的贪污分子送交人民法院依法惩办。这五个贪污分子一贯和不法私商勾结，贪污漏税，给国家造成很大损失。在这次税务局反贪污运动中，他们不但自己不坦白，反而阻止别人坦白。如贪污分子崔耀庭身为九分局直接税课课长，贪污受贿现已知道的有六百多万元。仅一次掩护一家私商漏税就有五百多万元。在这次反贪污运动中，他用种种办法和私商勾结，互相包庇，拒不坦白，且用各种方法威胁检举他的人。贪污分子吕钟伯在解放前就是一个特务分子，在这次反贪污运动中不仅自己不好好坦白，而且阻止七个贪污分子坦白，对运动完全采取抵抗态度。又如贪污分子赵玉山是个一贯的贪污犯，虽经人民政府多次教育、宽待，仍毫无改悔。在这次税务局开展反贪污运动时，大家最初还希望他们自动坦白，痛改前非；但经过领导方面和大家再三动员，他们不但不知悔改，反而破坏运动的开展，引起全体税务人员的激愤。因此，当税务局程宏毅局长宣布接受大家的要求，把这五个贪污分子送人民法院依法惩办时，大家都表示热烈拥护。许多干部讲话都一致赞成人民政府对拒不坦白的贪污分子逮捕法办，并对贪污分子表示极大的痛恨。
    在这次大会上，全国税务总局副局长崔敬伯向北京市全体税务工作人员指出：北京市税务局的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动虽然已经展开，并有了很大成绩，但这仅仅是运动的开始，今后必须深入一步，彻底肃清贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象。大会最后由北京市税务局局长程宏毅讲话，他号召北京市税务局全体工作人员更加紧张地动员起来，积极展开检举运动，大胆检举贪污受贿分子和不法商人行贿漏税的罪行。他说：贪污分子应该迅速、彻底坦白，只有彻底坦白才能得到人民的从宽处理。
