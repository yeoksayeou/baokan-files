The Anyang Special District Trade Union Office in Pingyuan Province conducted a preliminary inspection of the matter of concealing and using operating funds for agency production, which violated national financial regulations.

The person in charge of the Anyang Special District Trade Union Office felt that “life” was not good enough, so, disregarding the regulations of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, starting last spring, they concealed 6.5 million yuan of shares invested in the Pengcheng Porcelain Sales Station (publicly operated) in Cixian County, Hebei, and over 23 million yuan in dividends, as well as 10 million yuan invested in a bee farm in a cooperative in Xingtai and 10 million yuan in dividends. The Trade Union Office had 13 million yuan in shares in the public Hua'an Company, and without approval from higher authorities, they arbitrarily changed it to "agency production funds." The government successively allocated 20,000 jin of rice to the Trade Union Office as agency construction funds, from which the Trade Union Office misappropriated 8 million yuan to open a coal factory in cooperation with private merchants. Last November, the Trade Union Office, under the pretext of paying wages, withdrew 11 million yuan from the bank, and borrowed 9 million yuan from the mining area trade union in the name of running a trade union training class, investing it all in a newly established coking plant for production. As the Trade Union Office's "income" increased, the thinking of the Trade Union Office personnel also changed, and their lives gradually became extravagant and wasteful.

Now, the personnel of the Trade Union Office have realized that this is the result of the invasion of bourgeois ideology. The Trade Union Office will further conduct in-depth inspections in order to thoroughly solve this problem.

    平原省安阳专区工会办事处
    检查挪用事业费进行机关生产的错误
    平原省安阳专区工会办事处对隐瞒、动用事业费进行机关生产，违犯国家财经制度的事，作了初步检查。
    安阳专区工会办事处的负责人感到“生活”不好，就不顾全国总工会的规定，从去年春天起，隐瞒了在河北磁县彭城瓷业运销站（公营）入股的六百五十万元和红利二千三百多万元，和在邢台某合作社开蜜蜂厂的一千万元和红利一千万元，工会办事处在公营华安公司有股金一千三百万元，没有经过上级批准，便擅自把它改成了“机关生产费”。政府先后拨给工会办事处二万斤米，作为机关修建费用，工会办事处从中挪用八百万元，和私商合作开设煤厂。去年十一月里，工会办事处藉口开支工资，从银行取了一千一百万元，又用开工会训练班的名义，从矿区工会借了九百万元，一并投入一新生炼焦厂生产。工会办事处的“收入”多了，工会办事处人员的思想也变化了，他们的生活逐渐铺张浪费了。
    现在，工会办事处的人员已经认识到这是资产阶级思想侵袭的结果。工会办事处并将进一步深入检查，以便彻底解决这个问题。
