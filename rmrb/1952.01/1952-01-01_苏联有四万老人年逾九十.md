    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31st: According to survey materials from the Institute of Biology at Kharkov University, the Soviet Union currently has approximately 40,000 elderly people aged between ninety and one hundred and twenty years old, and even older. These elderly people not only reside in the southern regions previously considered to have natural conditions favorable to longevity but also live in regions with vastly different natural conditions, such as Yakutia and Kamchatka in the far north of the Soviet Union, or Ukraine and the Altai Krai. The survey materials on this subject have now been compiled into special cards by the Institute of Biology at Kharkov University to help Soviet scientists study methods of prolonging human life.

    苏联有四万老人年逾九十
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：根据哈尔科夫大学生物学研究所的调查材料，苏联目前约有四万个年在九十岁到一百二十岁以及更老的老人。这些老人不仅居住在以前大家认为自然条件有利于长寿的南部地区，并且住在苏联极北部地方的雅库特、堪察加，或是乌克兰以及阿尔泰边疆区等自然条件相差很大的地区。现在关于这方面的调查材料已由哈尔科夫大学生物研究所编成特制的卡片，帮助苏联科学家研究延长人类寿命的方法。
