    Beijing Municipal Organs, Organizations, and Public Industrial and Mining Enterprises
    Vigorously Launch the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Campaign
    Corrupt Elements with Serious Offenses Have Been Arrested and Dealt with According to Law
    [This Newspaper's Report] The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign is vigorously unfolding in Beijing's municipal organs, organizations, and public industrial and mining enterprises.
    Corrupt elements with extremely serious crimes have been arrested and dealt with according to law. For example, Liu Zheng, Deputy Manager of China Coal Industry Building Materials Company Beijing Building Materials Company, Wang Huisheng, Chief of the Business Section, and Zhou Zizhong, Manager of the company's Xibianmen Business Office, colluded with private merchants to engage in corruption and bribery. The theft of wood and reed mats alone caused the state to lose over 500 million yuan in property. At the same time, they colluded with private merchants, engaged in malfeasance, and failed to execute contracts, resulting in the accumulation of 3.09 billion yuan in state funds. Criminal Liu and others have degenerated into shameful thieves. The Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau has arrested them, and the Communist Party of China Beijing Municipal People's Government Organs Party Committee has expelled Liu Zheng and Zhou Zizhong from the Party. Another example is Zhang Jingqiao, Chief of the Engineering Section of the Zhenhua Iron Factory under the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, who stole public property and embezzled state assets totaling over 1.87 billion yuan. Criminal Zhang has been arrested and dealt with according to law. Others arrested and dealt with according to law are those with relatively serious acts of corruption who refused to confess or attempted to conceal the truth by minimizing their offenses. For example, Hou Guangsheng, Acting Director of the Zhoukoudian Lime Factory of the Beijing Construction Engineering Company, masterminded collective corruption, stealing public property and embezzling bank deposit interest and other large amounts of state assets. However, in the anti-corruption campaign, he stated: "I only accepted bribes of 15,000 yuan and some gifts; there is nothing else." There were also some corrupt elements who resisted the campaign and suppressed accusations. For example, Jiang Xurong, a technician at the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau and one of the "Five Tiger Generals" of the corrupt clique, consistently stole public materials. After "Big Tiger" Tan Jichang was arrested last December, he even convened a meeting with the other three "Tigers" to "discuss countermeasures." He threatened the other three "Tigers," saying: "If anyone says anything more, I will stab them with a white knife and they will bleed red!" The People's Government has immediately arrested those who dare to resist and undermine the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign and suppress accusations.
    In this campaign, some leading cadres in certain units, because they themselves had engaged in corruption and were unwilling to confess, adopted a lukewarm or even resistant attitude towards the campaign. The administrative leaders of these units have given them the punishment of dismissal, and some Communist Party members have also been expelled from the Party. For example, Han Linguang, Head of the Seventh District of Beijing and Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party of China Beijing Seventh District Committee, embezzled relief grain for the families of cadres. During the campaign, he quibbled, denied, and refused to confess, obstructing the development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. The Municipal People's Government has dismissed him, and the Communist Party of China Beijing Municipal Committee has decided to expel him from the Party. Gu Jingbo, Deputy Manager of Beijing Trust Company, used public office for private gain, invested in the private Daming Wire Factory, transferred public funds to private merchant circulation, and violated national processing policies, causing significant losses to the state. Although Gu Jingbo confessed to some of his corrupt acts, it was not thorough enough, so the administration has decided to give him the punishment of dismissal. Another example is Ding Zhizhong (Communist Party member), Secretary-General of the Beijing Relief Branch, who was deeply corrupted by bourgeois ideology, embezzled and degenerated, engaged in extravagance and waste, appointed cronies, and undermined the national financial system. The Municipal People's Government and the Relief Branch have issued an order to dismiss Ding Zhizhong from his position, ordering him to deeply reflect and await investigation and handling.
    The People's Government's handling of corrupt elements is based on the principle of combining punishment with education. Those who refuse to confess or resist and undermine the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign will certainly be punished according to law; those who sincerely confess or report meritorious service will be treated leniently, except for those with heinous crimes, that is, the severely guilty will be given lighter sentences, and those with minor guilt will have their punishments reduced or exempted. For example, Jia Heming and five others from the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau engaged in smuggling or embezzling ticket money between 1949 and 1950. After 1950, they raised their awareness and no longer engaged in corruption or illegal activities. During the campaign, they not only sincerely repented and thoroughly confessed, but also reported other smugglers and corrupt elements, exposing the criminal activities of certain corrupt elements in undermining the anti-corruption campaign. Therefore, the bureau gave them lenient treatment, and the court exempted them from criminal punishment. The Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, People's Court, Cooperative General Society, Telecommunications Bureau, Postal Bureau, People's Printing Factory, Beijing Clothing Factory, and other units have suggested that the government and the courts reduce or exempt the criminal and administrative punishments of corrupt elements who have thoroughly confessed, based on the severity of the circumstances and their performance in the campaign.

    北京市各机关团体和公营工矿企业
    反对贪污浪费运动猛烈展开
    情节严重的贪污分子已依法逮捕法办
    【本报讯】北京市各机关团体和公营工矿企业反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动正在猛烈展开。
    罪行十分严重的贪污分子，已被逮捕法办。例如中国煤业建筑器材公司北京建筑器材公司副经理刘正、业务科长王惠生和该公司西便门营业处经理周子仲等人，勾结私商贪污受贿，仅盗卖木材、席子两项，就使国家财产损失五亿元以上。同时，他们又与私商勾结，营私舞弊，不执行合同，致使国家资金积压达三十亿九千万元。刘犯等已沦为可耻的盗贼，市人民政府公安局已将他们逮捕，中国共产党北京市人民政府机关党委员会并开除刘正和周子仲的党籍。又如人民革命军事委员会所属震华铁工厂工务科长张敬桥等，盗卖公物，窃取国家资财达十八亿七千多万元，张犯已被逮捕法办。被逮捕法办的另一些人是有较严重的贪污行为而拒不坦白或者避重就轻企图蒙混的。例如北京市建筑工程公司周口店石灰厂代理厂长侯广生，主谋进行集体贪污，盗卖公家财物，侵吞银行存款利息等大量国家资财，但他在反贪污运动中却表示：“只受过一万五千元的贿赂，还受过一些礼物，其他什么也没有了。”还有一些抗拒运动和压制检举的贪污分子。如北京电信局贪污分子集团“五虎上将”之一、技工姜绪荣一贯盗卖公家的器材，当“大虎”谭继昌去年十二月被捕后，他居然召集其他三“虎”开会，“商讨对策”。他威吓其他三“虎”说：“谁要是再往外说，我就白刀子进去，红刀子出来！”人民政府对于这种胆敢抗拒和破坏反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动和压制检举的分子，已立即予以逮捕。
    在这次运动中，某些单位的领导干部，由于本身有贪污行为而不肯坦白，对运动采取冷淡甚至抗拒的态度。对于这些人，各该单位的行政领导方面都给他们以撤职处分，其中有的共产党员还被开除党籍。如本市第七区区长、中共北京市第七区委员会副书记韩林光，侵吞干部家属救济粮，在运动中狡辩抵赖、拒不坦白，阻碍反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的开展，市人民政府已将其撤职，中共北京市委员会已决定开除其党籍。北京信托公司副经理谷静波，假公济私，在私营大明电线场入股，将公家资金交给私商周转，并违反国家加工政策，使国家蒙受重大损失。谷静波对他的贪污行为虽然坦白了一些，但极不彻底，因此行政上已决定对他予以撤职处分。又如北京救济分会秘书长丁执中（共产党员），深受资产阶级思想的腐蚀，贪污蜕化，铺张浪费，任用私人，破坏国家财政制度，市人民政府和救济分会已明令撤销丁执中的职务，令其深刻反省，听候清查处理。
    人民政府对于贪污分子的处理是采取惩办与教育相结合的方针。凡是拒不坦白或抵抗、破坏反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的，一定依法予以惩办；凡是切实坦白或检举立功的除罪大恶极者外，都将予以从宽处理，即罪重者减轻，罪轻者减轻处分或免予处分。例如北京铁路分局贾鹤鸣等六人，在一九四九年至一九五零年，曾走私或贪污票款，一九五零年以后，觉悟提高，已不再贪污违法。他们在运动中不但真心悔改、彻底坦白，并且还检举其他走私、贪污分子，揭发了某些贪污分子破坏反贪污运动的罪恶活动，因此局方予以从宽处理，法院免除对他们的刑事处分。北京市税务局、民政局、人民法院、合作总社、电信局、邮政局、人民印刷厂、北京被服厂等单位，对于彻底坦白的贪污分子，都根据情节的轻重和在运动中的表现，建议政府和法院予以减轻或免除其刑事和行政处分。
