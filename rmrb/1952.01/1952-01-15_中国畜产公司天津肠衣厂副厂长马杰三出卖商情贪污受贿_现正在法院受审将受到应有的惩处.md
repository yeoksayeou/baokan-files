    Ma Jie-san, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Casing Factory of the China Animal By-Products Company, Sells Commercial Information, Embezzles, and Accepts Bribes; Now on Trial in Court and Will Receive Due Punishment
    Ma Jie-san, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Casing Factory under the North China Regional Company of the China Animal By-Products Company, colluded with private merchants, sold state commercial secrets, embezzled, and accepted bribes, causing significant losses to state property.
    Before liberation, Ma Jie-san was a rogue and cunning merchant who had been involved in the casing business for many years, and was known for his deceitful tricks. After liberation, he claimed to be familiar with the purchase, sale, and processing of Chinese casings, and was introduced to work at the Ministry of Trade. The responsible cadres of the Ministry of Trade valued and promoted him solely based on his "technical skills." In 1949, he was appointed as the director of the Tianjin Casing Factory, which was then under the China Fur Company. In April 1950, the Fur Company was reorganized into the Animal By-Products Company, and he continued to serve as the deputy director of the Casing Factory until March 1951. During Ma Jie-san's tenure as director and deputy director, he was fully responsible for the purchase and processing of casings. The leading cadres of the Regional Company were completely misled by his "business skills," and every increase or decrease in casing prices was sought from him in advance.
    Ma Jie-san's so-called "business skills" were nothing but trickery, deception, and collusion with private merchants to engage in various embezzlement schemes, treating the state enterprise as a place for personal speculation, profiteering, embezzlement, and self-enrichment. Ma Jie-san had old acquaintances with certain casing merchants in Tianjin, Baoding, Shanghai, Nanjing, Baotou, and even Xinjiang. He used these old relationships for embezzlement and bribery. Most of the more than twenty private casing shops in Tianjin had corrupt relationships with him.
    One of Ma Jie-san's main methods of embezzlement and bribery was to leak state commercial secrets. Ma Jie-san often disclosed the company's plans for purchasing casing prices to private merchants in advance. Therefore, often a few days before the Regional Company announced an increase in casing prices, few private merchants in Tianjin would deliver goods to the casing factory; and whenever a price decrease was announced a few days in advance, private merchants would rush to sell their goods to the casing factory. On one occasion, the General Company's notice of a casing price increase had not yet reached the Baotou branch, but local private merchants had already received the news from Ma Jie-san. According to Ma Jie-san's confession in court, he often provided commercial intelligence to a casing merchant in Xinjiang and received a subsidy of two million yuan from the private merchant.
    Ma Jie-san's methods of embezzlement and bribery were diverse. In transactions between the casing factory and private merchants, he extracted "commissions" at every level, fraudulently obtaining state and people's property. He took "commissions" when he handled loans to private merchants; he took "commissions" when he purchased goods from private merchants; sometimes, when the Regional Company's casings were exported through private merchants or processed by private merchants, he also took "commissions"; and sometimes he even appeared as a broker, taking "commissions" for introducing private merchants to complete transactions. Ma Jie-san sometimes colluded with private merchants to seize the company's transactions. For example, on one occasion, a state-owned trading department in Harbin telegraphed the casing factory, saying they had a batch of casings for sale. Ma Jie-san, knowing the price was cheap, had the Yuanxing and Hongyuan private casing shops purchase and transport them back to Tianjin, and then sell them to the casing factory; Ma Jie-san took a share of the profits. Sometimes, when Ma Jie-san saw that the goods brought by private merchants from other places were cheap, he would purchase them in his own name and then sell them to the state at a high price, making huge profits in the process. According to incomplete investigations, Ma Jie-san embezzled and accepted bribes totaling more than 70 million yuan. Because he frequently leaked state commercial secrets, the losses suffered by state property are incalculable.
    Ma Jie-san made things difficult for small casing vendors from the countryside, refusing to purchase from them, forcing them to sell their goods to private casing shops, so that the private merchants he colluded with could exploit them. Ma Jie-san colluded with many private merchants, using private influence to manipulate the Tianjin casing market. He once openly said, "If I say the company can't receive goods, I guarantee it won't receive a single one." Sometimes, if the work did not suit his wishes, he would sabotage the company's purchasing work. Ma Jie-san had effectively become a rogue and cunning merchant manipulating public-private transactions.
    Inside the casing factory, Ma Jie-san used various despicable means to win over certain backward workers, inciting them to demand holiday gifts and double pay, and opposing the development of labor competitions among employees. He created his own cronies and factional cliques among the employees, and practiced seduction and corruption towards certain cadres, eating, drinking, and laughing together, so that some people with poor understanding even said, "Ma Jie-san is a good person."
    In June 1950, Chen Zhen, the director of the Casing Factory, had reported to higher authorities that Ma Jie-san was suspected of embezzlement and bribery. Because the leading cadres of the Ministry of Trade had a serious bureaucratic work style and a simplistic technical viewpoint in their cadre policy, they mistakenly believed this was a cadre dispute, with old cadres excluding new cadres.
    It was not until March 1951 that Ma Jie-san's embezzlement was exposed due to mutual competition and jealousy among casing merchants. Now, the embezzler Ma Jie-san is on trial in the Tianjin People's Court, and he will receive due punishment. (Lin Mo)

### 中国畜产公司天津肠衣厂副厂长马杰三出卖商情贪污受贿  现正在法院受审将受到应有的惩处

    中国畜产公司天津肠衣厂副厂长马杰三出卖商情贪污受贿
    现正在法院受审将受到应有的惩处
    中国畜产公司华北区公司所属天津肠衣厂副厂长马杰三，勾结私商，出卖国家商情秘密，贪污受贿，使国家财产受到重大损失。
    马杰三在解放前，原是在肠衣行中鬼混多年的流氓奸商，一贯以捣鬼骗人出名。在解放后，他自称熟悉中国肠衣的购销和加工业务，经人介绍到中央贸易部工作。贸易部的负责干部单看他有“技术”而重用了他。一九四九年派他担任前中国皮毛公司所属天津肠衣厂的厂长。一九五○年四月，皮毛公司改为畜产公司，他继任肠衣厂副厂长，直到一九五一年三月。在马杰三当厂长和副厂长期间，肠衣的收购和加工业务，完全由他负责。区公司领导干部完全被他的“业务技术”所迷惑，每次肠衣价格的增减都要事先征求他的意见。
    马杰三的所谓“业务技术”，就是捣鬼、欺骗，勾结私商玩弄各种贪污的把戏，把国家的企业当成个人投机倒把、贪污自肥的场所。马杰三和天津、保定、上海、南京、包头以至新疆等地的某些肠衣商人都是旧相识。他利用这些旧关系贪污、受贿。天津的二十多家私营肠衣栈大部分和他有贪污行贿关系。
    马杰三贪污、受贿的主要方法之一，是泄露国家商情秘密。马杰三经常把公司关于收购肠衣价格的计划，事先透露给私商。所以，往往在区公司公布肠衣涨价的前几天，在天津就很少有私商给肠衣厂送货了；而每逢公布跌价的前几天，私商就纷纷赶着把货卖给肠衣厂。有一次，总公司关于肠衣涨价的通知还没有到包头分公司，当地私商却已经收到马杰三发出的消息了。据马杰三在法院自供，他经常供给新疆一个肠衣商人商业情报，并曾得到私商二百万元的津贴。
    马杰三贪污受贿的方法是多种多样的。在肠衣厂和私商进行交易中，他以吃“佣金”的方式，层层骗取国家人民财产。他经手贷款给私商时要吃“佣金”；收购私商货物时要吃“佣金”；有时区公司的肠衣通过私商出口或由私商进行加工，他也要吃“佣金”；有时他并以经纪人身份出现，在介绍私商成交中吃“佣金”。马杰三有时并和私商勾结，抢夺公司的交易。如有一次哈尔滨某国营贸易部门打电报给肠衣厂，说他们有一批肠衣出售，马杰三得知价钱便宜，便让元兴、鸿源两私营肠衣栈购运回天津，再卖给肠衣厂；所赚的钱，马杰三要分一份。有时马杰三见外地私商运来的货物便宜，便以个人名字空口认购，然后再以高价卖给国家，转手之间获得暴利。据现在不完全的调查，马杰三前后贪污、受贿共达七千多万元。由于他经常泄露国家商情秘密，使国家财产所受的损失是难以计算的。
    马杰三对乡下来的肠衣小贩百般刁难，不予收购，迫使小贩到私营肠衣栈售货，以便和他勾结的私商，从中进行剥削。马杰三和许多私商相勾结，借私人势力，操纵了天津的肠衣市场。他曾公开地说：“我要说公司收不到货，保准一把也收不到。”有时工作不合他的心意，他就破坏公司的收购工作。马杰三实际上已成为一个操纵公私交易的流氓奸商。
    在肠衣厂内，马杰三使用各种卑鄙手段拉拢某些落后的工人，鼓动他们闹节礼、闹双薪，并反对职工开展劳动竞赛。他在职工中造成自己的亲信和宗派小集团，对某些干部，则实行引诱和腐化，在一起吃吃喝喝，嘻嘻哈哈，以致有些认识差的人还说：“马杰三为人好”。
    在一九五○年六月，肠衣厂正厂长陈震曾向上级报告过马杰三有贪污、受贿的嫌疑。因为中央贸易部的领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，在干部政策中有单纯的技术观点，以致反而错误地认为这是干部闹不团结，是老干部排斥新干部。
    直到一九五一年三月，因为肠衣商人的互相争利和嫉恨，马杰三的贪污行为才被揭露出来。现在贪污犯马杰三正在天津市人民法院受审判，他将得到应有的惩处。　（林沫）
