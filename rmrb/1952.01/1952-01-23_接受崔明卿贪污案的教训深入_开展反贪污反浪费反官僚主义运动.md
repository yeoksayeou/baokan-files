    Accepting the Lessons of the Cui Mingqing Embezzlement Case to Deeply
    Carry Out the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement
    Zeng Chuanliu, Minister of Trade of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee
    Today, as the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is vigorously unfolding throughout the country, the public trial by the Wuhan Municipal People's Court of the major case of embezzlement and malfeasance involving Cui Mingqing and others from the Municipal Department Store and Sun Baosheng and others from the Hengyang Railway Bureau in collusion with unscrupulous merchants is of great educational significance. In these cases, the Cui Mingqing case alone involved 14 cadres and 13 private merchants, spanned more than two years, took place in Wuhan, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, involved various methods of embezzlement, directly and indirectly embezzled more than 200 million yuan, and caused a loss of more than 1.71 billion yuan to state property. This is another major embezzlement case in the state-owned trade sector of the Central South Region since the embezzlement case of Xu Zhiping and Zhen Peilin of the Wuhan Municipal Department Store the year before last.

    Why did the huge embezzlement case of Cui Mingqing occur after the execution of the embezzlers Xu Zhiping and Zhen Peilin, and why did it still happen in the Wuhan Municipal Department Store? What lessons should we learn from this case to deeply carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the state-owned trade sector of the entire region?

    First, we must recognize that the occurrence and development of the Cui Mingqing embezzlement case was due to the deliberate bribery of cadres by Teng Zhenlu, the manager of the private merchant Wu Wenji, and others to steal state property. It must be pointed out that after liberation, some people in the industrial and commercial circles continued to adopt the illegal business methods of the past to seek exorbitant profits, and spread their corrupt and decadent ideas such as putting profit first, harming others to benefit oneself, speculation and opportunism, extravagance and waste, and hedonism into the revolutionary ranks, inducing and eroding the staff of the organs. Some of our veteran cadres could not withstand the attack of their "sugar-coated bullets," and some new cadres brought the corrupt and hedonistic ideas of the exploiting classes from the old society and allowed them to grow. In this way, the dregs of the industrial and commercial circles and the workers with impure qualities colluded and made use of each other, which promoted the occurrence and development of embezzlement. The embezzlement and malfeasance cases of Cui Mingqing, Teng Zhenlu, and others exactly illustrate this problem. They colluded with each other and stole state assets through methods such as raising processing prices, stealing and selling processed paper, selling processed scrap paper at low prices, and using the name of state organs to purchase and sell allocated paper at low prices for collective embezzlement. The amount of embezzlement increased from several million to tens of millions, and the methods changed from simple to complex. Teng Zhenlu even evaded taxes, causing serious losses to state property.

    Second, we must recognize that the development of the Cui Mingqing embezzlement case is inseparable from the bureaucracy of our relevant leaders. After the execution of the embezzlers Xu Zhiping and Zhen Peilin, we launched an anti-corruption study in the state-owned trade sector of the entire region, but we overestimated the effect of the execution of Xu and Zhen, which led to complacency and relaxation of regular inspection work and regular political and ideological education for cadres. In 1949, Cui Mingqing started embezzling again when he went to Tianjin for procurement. Originally, Cui Mingqing had shown signs of corruption in his life, but Bai Hanqiu, the former manager of the Wuhan Municipal Department Store, and Hu Lianjiu, the deputy manager, did not notice it beforehand. After receiving reports, they did not investigate it out of consideration for talent, which led to the serious consequences of today. After the incident, Hu Lianjiu still did not actively and responsibly handle the inspection. This shows that there is a serious bureaucracy in the leadership style of the Wuhan Municipal Department Store, which objectively helped the development of the Cui Mingqing embezzlement case. After the embezzlement case of Xu Zhiping and Zhen Peilin occurred, the Trade Department of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee and the Central South Department Store Company did not conduct a serious inspection of the Wuhan Municipal Department Store, which further promoted the growth of bureaucracy in the leadership of the Municipal Department Store. After the Cui Mingqing case occurred, they did not adopt a positive attitude to help, did not participate in inspection and investigation work, so that the conclusion of the case could not be completed as soon as possible.

    Accepting the lessons of the Cui Mingqing embezzlement case, how should we deeply carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement?

    First, our state-owned trade workers in the Central South Region must strengthen self-ideological remolding. We must recognize that all non-proletarian ideas, especially bourgeois ideas, will make us degenerate and corrupt, will lead us from waste to embezzlement, will isolate us from the people, and even have the danger of "losing the party," "losing the country," and "losing ourselves." We must recognize that only by correcting our position, eliminating all non-proletarian viewpoints and methods, and abandoning all non-proletarian ideas and styles can we improve ourselves, improve our leadership, improve our work, and better serve the people. Therefore, all our cadres should carry out self-ideological remolding well, and those with impure ideological styles should further eliminate bourgeois and other non-proletarian ideas from their minds. This is the fundamental way to eliminate waste and prevent embezzlement.

    Second, our state-owned trade workers in the Central South Region must give play to their political enthusiasm and patriotic zeal and actively participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. Due to the impure thoughts and styles of some cadres, the phenomena of waste and embezzlement are still extremely common and extremely serious in the state-owned trade sector of the Central South Region. The handling of the Cui Mingqing embezzlement case clearly tells us that anyone who can bow his head to the people, confess his guilt, and even expose others will be given appropriate forgiveness by the people, and those who are obsessed with their mistakes will inevitably be severely punished in the end. Therefore, we hope that those who have unclean hands will sincerely confess, repent to the people, wash away their stains, and, in the spirit of being responsible to the Party, the people, and the revolutionary cause, eliminate ideological concerns and boldly and resolutely expose all corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Today, some comrades still do not care about the loss of state property, and think that someone is their old subordinate, old superior, or old comrade-in-arms, or that someone has been engaged in revolution for many years, so they dare not boldly expose their corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. When lower-level cadres and the masses rise up to expose these people, they even adopt a delaying, shirking, or ignoring attitude. This is a serious obstacle to deeply mobilizing the masses to carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and we must boldly, resolutely, and ruthlessly break through it.

    Third, I hope that the industrial and commercial circles in the Central South Region will vigorously launch a movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. After liberation, the industrial and commercial circles in the Central South Region have promoted the spirit of patriotism, obeyed state policies, engaged in legitimate business, and made certain contributions to the country. However, some people in the industrial and commercial circles have retained the nature of putting profit first, harming others to benefit oneself, speculation and opportunism, and stealing state assets and corrupting state staff through bribery, fraud, tax evasion, theft, and other means. It must be recognized that developing industry and commerce that is conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood and banning industry and commerce that is detrimental or harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood are clearly stipulated in the Common Program. Therefore, under the premise of obeying the long-term interests of the country, obtaining appropriate profits through legal business is the correct path for industrialists and businessmen. All acts of bribery, fraud, tax evasion, and theft to seek exorbitant profits are illegal. Therefore, we hope that the industrial and commercial circles will boldly confess themselves and resolutely expose others in the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. In particular, we hope that the shop assistants and workers will ruthlessly expose the unscrupulous merchants and corrupt elements. In this way, the confession and exposure in the organs and enterprises will be combined with the confession and exposure in the private industrial and commercial circles, so that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement can be deeply carried out in the state-owned trade sector of the Central South Region.

    Fourth, our state-owned trade workers in the Central South Region must launch a merciless struggle against bureaucracy. Comrade Stalin said, "When steering, you must look. If you can't see anything, then this is not leadership." Today, the seriousness of bureaucracy in some of our leading aspects is worse than what Comrade Stalin said. Some of our leading comrades are not only not opening their eyes to steer, but also sleeping soundly on the rice sacks, allowing mice to constantly steal state grain. It must be recognized that bureaucracy will promote the development of waste and embezzlement, which not only puts us in danger of "losing ourselves," but also has the danger of "losing the Party" and "losing the country" if allowed to develop. Therefore, our state-owned trade workers in the Central South Region must boldly expose the bureaucracy of the leadership, and the leading comrades at all levels must also conduct in-depth self-examination, and work together from top to bottom to eliminate bureaucracy, so as to improve leadership and improve work. In addition, leading comrades at all levels must also regularly grasp the ideological situation of cadres, strengthen political and ideological education for cadres, improve their political consciousness, eliminate waste, and prevent embezzlement.

    接受崔明卿贪污案的教训深入
    开展反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动
    中南军政委员会贸易部部长　曾传六
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动正在全国范围内如火如荼地开展的今天，武汉市人民法院公审市百货公司崔明卿等及衡阳铁路局孙宝生等勾结奸商贪污舞弊巨案，是具有重大教育意义的。在这些案件中，仅武汉市百货公司崔明卿等这一案件就牵连干部十四人和私商十三人，前后历时二年有余，贪污地点有武汉、上海、天津、广州四地，贪污方式多种多样，直接间接贪污两亿多元，并使国家财产遭受十七亿一千多万元的损失。这是继前年武汉市百货公司徐志平、镇沛霖贪污案以后中南区国营贸易部门的又一贪污巨案。
    为什么在处决贪污犯徐志平、镇沛霖后又发生崔明卿巨大贪污案而且仍然发生在武汉市百货公司呢？通过这一案件，我们又应该接受什么教训，来深入开展全区国营贸易部门的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动呢？
    首先，我们要认识崔明卿贪污案的发生和发展是由于私商邬文记经理滕镇鲁等蓄意贿赂干部，盗窃国家财产。必须说明，解放后工商界中还有人继续采取过去的非法经营方法，牟取暴利，而且把他们那些唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧、铺张浪费、享乐至上等腐化堕落思想传播到革命阵营里来，引诱并侵蚀机关工作人员。而我们有的老干部经不起他们的“糖衣炮弹”的攻击，有的新干部又从旧社会带来了剥削阶级的腐化享乐思想，并任其滋长。这样，工商界的败类和品质作风不纯的工作人员相互勾结、利用，就促成了贪污行为的发生和发展。崔明卿、滕镇鲁等贪污舞弊案件正好说明了这一问题。他们相互勾结，通过抬高加工价格、盗卖加工纸张、低价出卖加工碎纸及盗用国家机关名义低价套购配售纸张等方式，盗窃国家资财，进行集体贪污。贪污数由数百万而数千万，方式则由简单而复杂，滕镇鲁更从中偷漏税款，致造成国家财产的严重损失。
    其次，我们要认识崔明卿贪污案的发展是和我们有关领导方面的官僚主义分不开的。贪污犯徐志平、镇沛霖处决后，我们曾在全区国营贸易部门开展了一次反贪污的学习，但对徐、镇二犯被处决所收到的效果估计过高，从而产生麻痹思想，放松了经常的检查工作和对干部的经常性的政治思想教育。一九四九年崔明卿赴天津采购时，就又重新开始贪污了。本来，崔明卿平素已有生活腐化的迹象，但武汉市百货公司前任经理柏汉秋和副经理胡练九，事先未发觉，得到反映后又从惜才观点出发，不加追究，致造成今天的严重恶果。事发后，胡练九仍没有积极负责检查处理。这说明武汉市百货公司领导作风上严重地存在着官僚主义，对崔明卿贪污案的发展，客观上是起了帮助作用。徐志平、镇沛霖贪污案发生后，中南军政委员会贸易部和中南区百货公司对武汉市百货公司没有抓紧进行认真的检查，从而更助长了市百货公司领导方面官僚主义作风的滋长；崔明卿案件发生后，又未采取积极帮助的态度，没有参加检查和调查研究工作，以致未能使结案工作早日完成。
    接受崔明卿贪污案的教训，我们应该如何深入开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动呢？
    第一、我们中南区国营贸易工作人员，必须加强自我思想改造。必须认识：一切非无产阶级的思想特别是资产阶级的思想会使我们蜕化堕落，会使我们由浪费而走上贪污的道路，会使我们自绝于人民，甚至有“亡党”“亡国”“亡身”的危险。必须认识：只有端正立场，肃清一切非无产阶级的观点和方法，抛弃一切非无产阶级的思想和作风，才能提高自己，改进领导，改进工作，更好地为人民服务。因此，我们全体干部应该很好地进行自我思想改造，而思想作风不纯的更要进一步从思想上肃清资产阶级思想及其他非无产阶级思想，这是消灭浪费和杜绝贪污的根本办法。
    第二、我们中南区国营贸易工作者，必须发挥政治积极性和爱国热情，积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。由于部分干部的思想和作风不纯，浪费和贪污的现象，在中南区国营贸易部门还是极其普遍极其严重的。崔明卿贪污案的处理很明显地告诉我们：凡是能够向人民低头坦白悔过甚至检举别人的，都会得到人民适当的宽恕，执迷不悟的最后必然受到严厉的惩处。因此，我们希望自己手上不干净的人要诚恳坦白，向人民悔过，洗去自己的污点，并本着对党、对人民、对革命事业负责的精神，消除思想顾虑，大胆地坚决地检举一切贪污、浪费和官僚主义。今天有的同志仍然不关心国家财产的损失，认为某人是自己的老部下、老上司、老战友，某人革命多年，从而对于他们的贪污、浪费和官僚主义不敢大胆揭露，在下级干部和群众起来检举这些人时，他们甚至采取拖延、推诿或置之不理的态度。这是深入发动群众开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动的严重障碍，我们必须大胆地、坚决地、无情地予以突破。
    第三、我希望中南区工商界大力展开反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报的运动。解放后，中南区工商界发扬了爱国主义精神，服从国家政策，从事正当经营，对国家有其一定贡献。但工商界中还有人原封不动地保留了唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的本质，通过行贿、欺诈、偷漏、盗窃等方式，盗窃国家资财，腐蚀国家工作人员。必须认识：发展有利于国计民生的工商业，和取缔不利或有害于国计民生的工商业是共同纲领明文规定的。因此，在服从国家长远利益的前提之下，通过合法经营，获取适当利润是工商业者正确的道路。一切行贿、欺诈、偷税、盗窃以牟取暴利的行为都是非法的。因此，我们希望工商界在反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报的运动中，自己大胆坦白，坚决检举别人，尤其是希望店员工人同志无情地检举奸商和贪污分子；这样机关和企业内部同私营工商界的坦白和检举相结合，使反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动在中南区国营贸易部门深入开展下去。
    第四、我们中南区国营贸易工作人员必须向官僚主义展开无情的斗争。斯大林同志说过：“掌舵时要看。如果什么也看不见，那么这并不是领导。”今天我们某些领导方面官僚主义的严重程度比斯大林同志所说的还要坏，我们若干领导同志不但没有睁眼掌舵，而且还酣睡在米袋上让老鼠不断偷食国家存粮。必须认识：官僚主义会助长浪费和贪污的发展，不仅使我们有“亡身”的危险，如任其发展，更会有“亡党”和“亡国”的危险。因此，我们中南区国营贸易工作人员要大胆地揭发领导上的官僚主义，而各级领导同志亦须深入进行自我检查，上下结合共同努力消灭官僚主义，来改进领导、改进工作。另外，各级领导同志还须经常掌握干部的思想情况，加强对干部的政治思想教育，提高其政治觉悟，消灭浪费，杜绝贪污。
