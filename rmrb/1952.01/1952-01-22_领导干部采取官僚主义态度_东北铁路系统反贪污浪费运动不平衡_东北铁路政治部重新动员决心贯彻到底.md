    Leading Cadres Adopt Bureaucratic Attitudes
    Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Movement in Northeast Railway System Unbalanced
    Political Department of Northeast Railway Re-mobilizes, Determined to Carry Through to the End
    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Northeast Railway system, although it has already achieved some results, is still incomplete and unbalanced. The Political Department of the Northeast Railway has re-mobilized, determined to carry this movement through to the end.
    After three months of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Northeast Railway system, some problems have been exposed. For example: Su Jie, the director of the Qiqihar Railway Political Department and acting director of the bureau, and Wang Huayi, the deputy director, falsely reported the final accounts in 1950 and withheld 7.47131 billion yuan (Northeast currency) as a private nest egg to build houses, buy cars, and dispose of it arbitrarily. Eleven people in the oxygen plant of the Qiqihar Railway Administration collectively embezzled public funds for five consecutive years, totaling 228 million yuan (RMB, same below).
    In units where the movement has progressed well, the ideological awareness of employees has been raised, righteousness has gained the upper hand, and everyone generally recognizes that corruption is the most shameful behavior; thus, some cadres have been saved, and everyone has been alerted. However, for the entire railway system, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has not yet formed a mass-based, conscious movement of confession and denunciation. The Commissioner's Office and directly subordinate organs of the Administration have done a better job, the organs of each branch bureau have done a poorer job, and most of the field sites, stations, and sections have not moved, while many problems in the better units of the directly subordinate organs have not been dealt with in a timely manner. Most units have only focused on investigating corruption, and the serious phenomenon of waste has not been universally investigated. The masses have not been mobilized, and there are still many erroneous understandings and concerns. Therefore, the momentum of the movement is not strong, and the impact is not broad enough. The main reasons for this phenomenon are:
    1. Leading cadres have insufficient understanding of the significance of this movement. They believe: "The railway is not connected to finance, it only knows transportation, and it is impossible to embezzle." "The railway procedures are very strict, and corruption will not occur." The head of the Materials Section of the Andong Railway Branch Bureau said: "Our procurement personnel have all undergone three reviews and three checks, and they will never be corrupt." Some people advocate only opposing bureaucracy, and some people have a "getting through the barrier" mentality. They use the excuse that "the railway only has waste and needs to carry out an increase production and economize movement," and they are eager to end the anti-corruption movement as soon as it starts. Thus, this movement lacks ideological leadership.
    2. The leadership has not fully promoted democracy and mobilized the masses. Some leading cadres do not earnestly mobilize, but only say at discussion meetings: "Whoever is corrupt, speak up!" Some cadres suppress democracy. When employees ask him to self-criticize, he actually says: "I will not self-criticize." When others give him opinions, he says: "You don't understand my work situation." Some say: "You are crows landing on a pig, you see others (referring to the leaders) are black, but you don't see yourselves (referring to the masses) are black." Some say: "Do you have concrete evidence? Wait until the evidence is confirmed before raising it." This has made many people even more concerned and afraid to actively participate in this movement.
    3. There is serious bureaucracy in the organizational leadership of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. When the Northeast Railway Commissioner called on the entire railway system to launch an anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement last September, he did not carefully analyze the situation and conduct in-depth mobilization. After the movement was launched, he did not promptly understand the situation and lacked inspection and specific leadership. Until recently, the leading comrades of the Commissioner's Office and the Political Department of the Northeast Railway still lacked a clear and specific division of labor in leading the entire movement.
    The Northeast Railway's massive basic construction projects have no one specifically responsible, causing great losses to state assets. The financial department of the office never asks about the deposits of various grassroots units to the bank, and the profit delivered by the entire railway is 27 percent less than the actual profit. On the other hand, the financial department has to borrow money from the bank when it has no money, thus paying more than 510 million yuan in interest. A small number of transport personnel accept bribes from private merchants, illegally sell wagons, and steal and transport prohibited materials. The livelihood sector has the corrupt phenomenon of selling less for more and selling bad for good. From the actual situation of the Northeast Railway, it is extremely necessary to launch a mass-based anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement throughout the railway system.

    领导干部采取官僚主义态度
    东北铁路系统反贪污浪费运动不平衡
    东北铁路政治部重新动员决心贯彻到底
    东北铁路系统的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，虽然已经有了一些成绩，但仍然不彻底、不平衡。东北铁路政治部再作动员，决心把这个运动贯彻到底。
    东北铁路系统经过三个月的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，暴露了一些问题。如：齐齐哈尔铁路政治部主任代理局长苏杰、副局长王化一，在一九五○年假报决算，扣留资金七十四亿七千一百三十一万元（东北币），作为小家底，修房子，买汽车，任意支配。齐齐哈尔铁路管理局氧气厂十一人集体贪污，连续达五年之久，贪污公款二亿二千八百万元（人民币，下同）。
    在运动进行得较好的单位，员工的思想觉悟提高了，正气占了上风，大家普遍认识到贪污是最可耻的行为；因而挽救了一些干部，警惕了大家。但就全路来说，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动还没有形成群众性的自觉的坦白和检举运动。特派员办事处和管理局直属机关搞得较好，各分局机关搞得较差，现场、站、段多半没有动，而各直属机关的较好的单位，许多问题也没有及时处理。大部分单位只着重检查了贪污，对于严重的浪费现象没有普遍检查。群众没有发动起来，并且还有很多错误的认识和顾虑。因此，运动的声势不大，影响不够广阔。形成这个现象的主要原因是：
    一、领导干部对这个运动的意义认识不足，他们认为：“铁路与财经不粘边，就知道运输，想贪污也贪不上。”“铁路手续挺严格，不会发生贪污。”安东铁路分局材料科长说：“我们的采购员都经过了三审三查，绝不会贪污。”有人则主张只反官僚主义，还有的人有“过关思想”，他们藉口“铁路只有浪费，需要开展增产节约运动”，反贪污运动刚一开始，就急于收场。这样，就使这个运动缺乏思想领导。
    二、领导方面没有充分地发扬民主、动员群众。有的领导干部不认真地进行动员，只在讨论会上说：“谁贪污谁就说吧！”有的干部压制民主，在员工要求他检讨时，他竟说：“我不会检讨。”别人给他提意见时，他说：“你们不了解我的工作情况。”有的说：“你们是乌鸦落在猪身上，看见别人（指领导）黑，看不见自己（指群众）黑。”有的说：“你们有确实材料吗？等材料证实了再提。”这就使许多群众更增加了顾虑，不敢积极参加这个运动。
    三、在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的组织领导方面有严重的官僚主义。东北铁路特派员在去年九月号召全路开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动时，没有细致分析情况进行深入动员。运动开展之后，又没有及时了解情况，缺乏检查和具体领导。直到最近，特派员办事处和东北铁路政治部的领导同志，对整个运动的领导，仍缺乏明确的具体的分工。
    东北铁路庞大基本建设工程没有专人负责，使国家资财遭受很大的损失。办事处的财务部门对各基层单位向银行存款从不过问，全路利润解入较实际利润少百分之二十七。另一方面财务部门没有钱还得向银行借，因此支付利息五亿一千多万元。少数运输人员，接受私商贿赂，非法出卖车皮，盗运禁运物资。生计部门有以少卖多、以坏卖好的贪污现象。从东北铁路的实际情况看来，在全路开展一个群众性的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动是极其必要的。　（东北日报）
