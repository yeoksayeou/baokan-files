Editor's Note: This is a report written by Comrade Wang Guangwei, Director of the Northeast People's Government Office, after conducting a survey in the countryside with seven comrades. Comrade Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, instructed: "This report is extremely valuable. Please ask Party members from provincial, prefectural, county, district committees, branches, production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams, as well as comrades at all levels of government, to seriously study and discuss it in order to refer to these experiences to improve the work of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation." The situations and experiences discussed in this investigation report should be noted in all areas where agricultural production mutual aid organizations already have a considerable foundation. We hope that comrades in all such areas will pay attention to studying this report and conduct typical surveys of various types of agricultural production mutual aid organizations and send them to us.

    The Entire Group Lives a Middle Peasant Life

    The Jin Shilong Mutual Aid Team in Yingcheng Village, Fifth District, Yanji County, Jilin Province, developed into a production cooperative with land shares in the spring of 1951. Jin Shilong (Korean ethnicity) is the Deputy Secretary of the CCP branch in Yingcheng Village. Of the 195 households in the village, 38 are Han Chinese. There are eight mutual aid teams in the village, including two that provide seasonal mutual aid, four that provide year-round mutual aid, and two production cooperatives. Among the year-round mutual aid teams, two groups will be upgraded to production cooperatives in 1952. The natural village where the Jin Shilong Cooperative is located has a total of 22 households, 16 of which participate in land shares, 3 households that only participate in mutual aid without land shares, 1 household that has newly moved into this village, and 2 former rich peasant households.

    The living standards of the members of the Jin Shilong Cooperative have all risen to the level of middle peasants. The middle peasant standard they set themselves is: 1. Have arable land commensurate with the population; 2. Have enough livestock and tools to cultivate their own land; 3. Enough to eat (including rice accounting for 20%), enough to wear, with bedding; 4. Have the economic ability to provide for their children's education (from primary school to high school). In the past, only landlords and rich peasants had foreign wells, but now 16 of the 19 households in the group have foreign wells.

    The Development Process from Low Level to High Level

    In 1947, the village established mutual aid teams in a forced manner. According to Jin Shilong: "At that time, it was a large group of 25 households, with 30 to 40 laborers. Regardless of whether the land was large or small, everyone swarmed to it. As a result, there were too many people and nothing to do, so they sat on the edge of the fields telling stories." "There was no distinction in calculating labor; men, women, strong, and weak were all counted as one work point. Strong laborers suffered." The masses said: "The mutual aid team eats people; if we work for a long time, we will be eaten up." Land yields decreased; people could not be gathered for any meetings.

    Comrade Jin Shilong asked his superiors about this issue and announced that groups would be organized based on the principle of voluntary participation by the masses. The masses were very happy and voluntarily formed five groups on their way from the meeting. The masses disliked cadres holding meetings that delayed work, so none of the five groups wanted cadres. The four cadres had to form their own group. Comrade Jin Shilong often encouraged the cadres, and with fewer meetings in 1948, the production performance of the cadre group was better than the other groups in the autumn. The masses were envious. Cui Chengtian said: "The cadres knew earlier that there would be fewer meetings this year, so they didn't look for us. Look! They are doing so well!" After obtaining the consent of the masses, the cadres dispersed back into the groups, and Jin Shilong joined the Cui Chengtian group.

    In order to improve the mutual aid teams, the cadres put forward the slogan "Don't delay work because each group sends people to county and district meetings" and called on everyone to elect a large group leader to represent everyone at the meetings. All the masses enthusiastically supported this method and elected Comrade Jin Shilong as the large group leader. Comrade Jin Shilong first called on the groups to conduct production competitions, and leadership was established from then on.

    In 1949, the mutual aid teams had organizational leadership and plans, and land yields increased. However, the following contradictions arose in production: 1. Contradiction in land work point evaluation: Landowners wanted to evaluate the labor used on the land as less, so as to pay less wages; laborers wanted to evaluate it as more, so as to get more wages. 2. Contradiction between early weeding and late weeding. 3. Contradiction between early and late work commencement and completion: When working for themselves, they hoped everyone would gather early and finish work late; when working for others, they wanted to gather late and finish work early, to take some time to do their own things. 4. Contradiction between weeding in the morning and weeding in the afternoon: Everyone tried to have their own land weeded in the morning (strong labor in the morning, the sun is poisonous, and the grass is easily dried to death). 5. Contradiction between weeding before and after rain: Everyone was unwilling to weed their own land after the rain (muddy and laborious). 6. Contradiction in harvesting crops: Everyone wanted to harvest later, so that the crops would be more mature, but after the wind, they rushed to harvest early to reduce losses. 7. Contradiction between early and late planting: Everyone competed to plant their own land early. 8. Contradiction in work delays: No one wanted to bear the time spent traveling to and from distant lands. 9. Contradiction between cadres and activists and the masses: Cadres and activists often felt they were at a disadvantage. Sometimes their land was cultivated and weeded early, and backward masses would make strange remarks. Jin Shilong called these contradictions the eighteen contradictions in the mutual aid team.

    After discussion by the entire group, it was decided to implement "standard work points." All land was evaluated for standard work point numbers according to its quality, distance, and size. Landowners paid wages according to the "standard work points," without having to worry about the actual number of work points used (generally 173 work points for paddy fields and 73 work points for dry land from the beginning of spring plowing to the completion of public grain delivery). In this way, the dispute over wages was resolved. However, since the problems affected by early planting, late planting, early harvesting, and late harvesting were not resolved, the basic problem of yield was not resolved. In the spring of 1950, after repeated discussions, Li Changlu (a member of the masses) suggested that the mutual aid team simply buy all the land for public ownership, so that the yield of each piece of land and every member of the group would be related; this opinion was initially accepted by some of the masses and began to brew land shares, but Vice County Head Niu Fusheng pointed out: "Do not rush to implement land shares, you can use the 'yield guarantee system' method to transition for a while." The "yield guarantee system" was based on the quality and size of the land, after self-reporting and public discussion, to evaluate standard yields. Except for force majeure reasons such as disasters, landowners received grain according to the "standard amount." However, the part of the production that exceeded the standard due to diligent management belonged to the laborers. As a result of implementation, there were no more disputes; labor enthusiasm was greatly improved; and yields greatly increased. This year, paddy fields averaged 6,800 jin per hectare, and dry land averaged 3,000 jin per hectare, an increase of 36,000 jin compared to 1949 (total production in 1949 was 79,000 jin, and total production in 1950 was 115,000 jin).

    Due to intensive cultivation and a large amount of fertilization, yields increased, and the quality of the land also naturally improved. As a result, new contradictions arose: After the quality of the land improved, landowners were not satisfied with the original standard yield and demanded an increase in yield or withdrawal from the group to work independently. For example, Cui Taizhu's land had a self-reported yield of 1,600 jin, but actually harvested 3,120 jin. He demanded that the standard yield for 1951 be increased to 3,120 jin. Song Bingkuan had 7.1 mu of paddy fields with a self-reported yield of 4,200 jin, but actually harvested 6,240 jin. He proposed to withdraw from the group and cultivate independently. If this contradiction was not resolved, it directly dampened the enthusiasm of the laborers, and the mutual aid team was in danger of disintegrating. After a long period of discussion and research by the masses, it was finally decided that land shares were necessary.

    When discussing how to take shares, the first issue encountered was whether to include land near the river and hillside land, because land near the river was constantly being swallowed by the river water; hillside land was constantly being washed away by rainwater, and soon after, it would either be washed away or become uncultivable. Everyone thought: It would be a waste of time to take this kind of land as shares. However, after discussion, everyone's conclusion was: "The land was given by Chairman Mao. If Chairman Mao didn't give us land, where would we get land? For the sake of everyone having food to eat, this land must be included." Comrade Jin Shilong also proposed planting trees to protect the dikes along the river and planting fruit trees on the hillsides to avoid losses (450 trees had already been planted in 1951). As a result, the decision to allow land near the river and hillside land to be included in the shares was passed.

    Secondly, there was the issue of withdrawal from the shares. In order to maintain a large area of cultivated land and prevent a piece from being dug out in the middle due to withdrawal, it was decided that when withdrawing from the shares, money would be returned but not the land (this provision is inconsistent with the principle of voluntariness - investigators).

    Third, there was the issue of valuation. In order to ensure that the production cooperative did not disintegrate, the land was valued at a lower price, in principle based on the original annual yield (generally 600,000 for paddy fields and 300,000 for dry land, which is 4 to 5 times lower than the market price).

    Fourth, there was the issue of fruit distribution. A standard annual yield was set, and within the yield, it was distributed according to net income. Laborers received 70%, and land received 30%; for the excess portion, laborers received 50%, and the public accumulation fund received 50%.

    Fifth, there was the issue of land shares and fruit distribution for land cultivated on behalf of revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families. In addition to the 30% of the standard yield that the land should receive, the same 70% of the laborers and 50% of the excess portion that the laborers should receive was obtained according to the number of work points required for cultivation on behalf.

    The Superiority of Agricultural Production Cooperatives

    1. Yield has increased.

    The 1951 yields of land-share production cooperatives, general mutual aid teams, and individual households are as follows:
    Name　　　　Paddy Field Yield per Hectare　　　　Dry Field Yield per Hectare
    Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative　　　　7,730 jin　　　　5,360 jin (including specialty products)
    Mutual Aid Team　　　　7,600 jin　　　　2,015 jin
    Song Bingkuan Individual Household　　　　2,468 jin　　　　1,892 jin

    2. After the land boundaries were opened up, the land area increased. Sixteen hectares of paddy fields increased by seven mu.

    3. Land can be rationally adjusted and used, and special crops can be planted. The cooperative planted two hectares of tobacco leaves (individual households do not have enough labor to plant), earning 30 million yuan.

    4. Fertilization can be applied as needed to improve land quality.

    5. Selfishness has been eliminated. Now, one person can be assigned to manage things such as irrigation. In the past, everyone was not at ease with just one person doing it.

    6. New agricultural tools can be used and new cultivation methods can be tested without fear of not having enough grain to eat if they fail.

    7. With the public accumulation fund, military families, women (wages for three months of rest before and after childbirth), and children's schooling can be taken care of (in addition to the expenses of the village primary school, 13 children of cooperative members are studying at Yanji Middle School. In the past, each person needed 5 dou of grain per month, but now a woman helps with cooking, and only 3 dou per month are needed). Nurseries can also be established to increase women's working hours.

    8. Strengthened ties with supply and marketing cooperatives. Contracts are signed with supply and marketing cooperatives for the sale of products and the purchase of production tools and daily necessities.

    9. Sideline occupations can be operated in a planned way.

    Song Bingkuan Suffered a Loss by Working Independently

    Song Bingkuan once left the mutual aid team and experimented on his small piece of land, but soon returned to the mutual aid team.

    Song Bingkuan joined the mutual aid team in 1947. He had 1.88 hectares of dry land, 7.1 mu of paddy fields, one cow, one cart, and one male and one female laborer. Why did he leave the mutual aid team? According to him: "In 1949, when the actual yield per square meter was investigated, the yield of my 7.1 mu of paddy fields was calculated to be 6,300 jin; when the yield guarantee system was implemented, the self-reported yield and public discussion was 4,200 jin, but the actual yield was 6,240 jin (this was the result of collective labor and a large amount of fertilization). I thought that my own labor was also sufficient, and I also had several children in school, so the expenses were large. Wouldn't it be better to earn more by cultivating on my own? So I withdrew from the group to work independently." When he withdrew from the mutual aid team, he said to Cui Chengtian: "I will do better than the mutual aid team by working independently." What was the result of working independently? He said: "Although the losses from reduced harvests and work delays were not calculated in detail, they were no less than 2,000 jin of rice at the minimum." Moreover: "When I was busy, I worked from early morning to late night, which was more labor-intensive than working in the group, and I still couldn't do a good job. When I was idle? Not only was I unable to engage in sideline occupations, but I also couldn't really rest, and I had to graze the cattle and chop firewood myself." Why? He said: "In the past, during the busy farming season, the mutual aid team had special elderly people to take care of the children; now, it is impossible to work independently. My wife has to take care of the children and cannot participate in labor at all. In the group, one person is assigned to manage things such as irrigation and cattle grazing. Now, I have to do it myself, which takes up a lot of labor time." "The rice in the group is transplanted in straight rows, but I can't even manage ordinary transplanting by myself, so I have to broadcast it; the grass has only been weeded once, and a lot of the grass is even taller than the rice; when the group had finished weeding the dry land twice, I hadn't even finished once. When pulling the land, it is difficult for one person to load the cart and tie it tightly, so the number of trips is greater, and the losses are also greater." Finally, he said: "I won't talk about all this! The thing that makes me the most uncomfortable is that the Yanji Paper Mill collected rice straw in October this year, and the price offered was 340 yuan per bundle. At that time, no individual household could cut it down; but the Jin Shilong Production Cooperative rushed to get 40,000 bundles, and each household received more than 600,000 yuan. Now each bundle is only worth 150 yuan, and it is difficult to sell. I thought, if I hadn't withdrawn, I would have had a share of this 600,000 yuan! Now it is lost for nothing. I can't let go of this matter in my heart." After the education of the facts, he applied to the mutual aid team to join the group again and conducted a self-criticism to everyone. The first sentence of his self-criticism was: "I have let down Chairman Mao." Then he said: "Chairman Mao called on us to organize, but I didn't listen to him, and I suffered a loss." After specifically criticizing some practical problems, he swore: "From now on, I will never leave the mutual aid team again, even if I die."

    Why Can the Jin Shilong Group Develop into a Cooperative?

    The Jin Shilong Mutual Aid Team has been able to develop into such a higher-level form today because of these conditions:

    1. The Party's leadership is strong. Problems in the group are first submitted to the branch for discussion, and then the Party members take them back to the group for discussion (the branch's tasks are also clear: 1. Do a good job in production; 2. Do a good job in the supply and marketing cooperative). Major issues are submitted to the village people's representative conference for discussion and proactively reported to the superiors.

    2. Enlighten the masses in a democratic way and move forward steadily completely on the basis of the masses' conscious and voluntary actions. When some masses are still unable to become aware after repeated enlightenment, they can patiently wait. They still allow three households who are unwilling to take land shares to participate in mutual aid.

    3. The members of the cooperative have a high level of awareness. They believe that land shares are to prepare conditions for moving towards socialism, and they see a bright future.

    4. Comrade Jin Shilong has a good personal style and a high level of awareness. He said: "Doing a good job in the mutual aid team is to complete the task assigned to me by the Party." "These works are all laying the foundation for socialism." He can constantly discover problems and solve problems.

    The Main Shortcomings of the Jin Shilong Cooperative

    The biggest shortcoming is that sideline occupations have not been done well. Raising chickens, raising sheep, raising pigs, and raising horses have all suffered from not being "cared for" properly, and many have died of illness or been sold at a loss. In addition, a huge sum of 30 million yuan was used to build a very beautiful but not immediately usable nursery, which is a waste in the current situation and affects the turnover of funds for sideline occupations.

    Another shortcoming is that they do not pay enough attention to accumulating fertilizer and conserving resources. Pigs and chickens run all over the place, and rice grains are scattered all over the ground, and no one cares when pigs and chickens eat the Yuanzi No. 2 rice.

    The Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative is a relatively advanced form of agricultural production today. In order to consolidate and improve such cooperatives, the leadership should provide them with assistance in all aspects, especially technical assistance. They must be made to earnestly carry out sideline occupations and further increase yields and income in order to consolidate this form.

    金时龙农业生产合作社
    编者按：这是东北人民政府办公厅主任王光伟同志带领七个同志下乡调查所写的报告。东北人民政府主席高岗同志批示：“这个报告极有价值。请各省委、地委、县委、区委、支部、生产合作社、互助组的党员同志，及各级政府的同志们认真研究讨论，以便参考这些经验来改进农业生产互助合作的工作。”这个调查报告里谈到的情况和经验，在农业生产互助组织已有相当基础的一切地区，都是应当注意的。希望所有这样的地区的同志们都注意研究这个报告，并作出各种类型的农业生产互助组织的典型调查，寄给我们。
    全组都过中农生活
    吉林省延吉县第五区英成村金时龙互助组于一九五一年春发展为土地入股的生产合作社。金时龙（朝鲜族）是英成村中共支部副书记。全村一百九十五户中，汉族占三十八户。全村有八个互助组，内按季节互助的两个，常年互助的四个，生产合作社两个。常年互助组中，有两个组将于一九五二年提高为生产合作社。金时龙合作社所在的自然屯共二十二户，土地入股的有十六户，土地不入股只参加互助者三户，新搬入这个屯的一户，另有旧富农两户。
    金时龙合作社社员的生活水平，均已升为中农。他们自己订的中农标准是：1、有与人口相适应的耕地；2、有足够耕作自己土地的牲畜和工具；3、够吃（内大米占百分之二十）、够穿、有铺、有盖；4、有供给子弟读书（由小学至高级学校）的经济能力。过去只有地主富农有洋井，现在该组十九户中，有十六个洋井。
    由低级到高级的发展过程
    一九四七年，该屯即以强迫的方式成立了互助组。据金时龙说：“当时是二十五户的大组，三、四十名劳动力，不论大块小块土地，都是蜂拥而往，结果人多了没事干，就坐在地头讲故事。”“计算劳动力时也无区别，男、女、强、弱都算一个工，强的劳动力吃亏。”群众说：“互助组吃人，干长了我们会被吃光。”土地产量降低了；开什么会，都召集不起人。
    金时龙同志向上级请示了这个问题，宣布根据群众自愿原则组织小组。群众很高兴，在散会途中就自愿地结合了五个小组。群众嫌干部常开会误工，五个组都没有要干部，四个干部只好自己组成一个组。金时龙同志经常鼓励干部，加上一九四八年会议也较少，秋后干部组的生产成绩比别组都好。群众眼热了，崔承天说：“干部早知道今年会少，所以不找我们，看！他们干的多好！”经征得群众同意后，干部又散入各组，金时龙入了崔承天组。
    为了把互助组提高一步，干部们提出“不要因每个小组都出人去县、区开会而误工”的口号，并号召选一大组长，代表大家去开会。全体群众热烈拥护这个办法，选举了金时龙同志为大组长。金时龙同志首先号召各组进行生产竞赛，从此建立了领导。
    一九四九年，互助组有了组织领导和计划，土地的产量提高了。但在生产中发生了下列矛盾：1、土地评工的矛盾：土地所有者愿把土地使用的人工评的少些，好少出工资；劳动者愿评的多些，好多得工资。2、早铲晚铲的矛盾。3、上工收工早晚的矛盾：给自己做工时，希望大家早集合，晚收工；给别人做工时，又愿意晚集合，早收工，抽出时间作点自己的事。4、上午铲地与下午铲地的矛盾：大家都争取自己的地在上午铲（上午劳动力强，太阳毒，草易晒死）。5、雨前雨后铲地的矛盾：大家都不愿在雨后铲自己的地（泥泞费工）。6、收割庄稼的矛盾：都愿迟收割，使庄稼更成熟，但风后又争着早收，减少损失。7、早种晚种的矛盾：都争着早种自己的地。8、误工的矛盾：远地往返途中所消耗的时间，都不愿负担。9、干部积极分子与群众的矛盾：干部与积极分子常常自认吃亏，有时他们的地耕铲早了，落后群众又讲怪话。金时龙把这些矛盾说成互助组中的十八个矛盾。
    经过全组讨论，决定施行“标准工”。将所有土地，按好坏、远近、大小，评出标准工数。土地所有者按“标准工”付工资，不必过问实用工数多少
    （一般是自春耕起至送完公粮为止，水田一百七十三个工，旱田七十三个工）。这样，解决了工资问题的争执。但因先种、后种、先收、后收等影响问题没有解决，所以产量的基本问题并未解决。一九五○年春季，又进行反复讨论，李长禄（群众）提议，干脆由互助组将土地全部收买为公有，使每块地的产量和每个组员都发生关系；这个意见当时已被部分群众接受，并开始酝酿土地入股，但副县长牛复胜同志指出：“不要过急的实行土地入股，可再用‘产量保证制’办法过渡一下。”“产量保证制”是根据土地好坏、大小，经过自报公议，评出标准产量。除灾害等不可抗的原因外，土地所有者按“标准额”得粮。但因经营努力而超产部分，则归劳动者所有。实行结果，争执没有了；劳动热忱大大提高；产量大增；这一年水田平均每垧产六千八百斤，旱田平均每垧产三千斤，较一九四九年多产三万六千斤（一九四九年总产七万九千斤，一九五○年总产十一万五千斤）。
    由于精耕细作和大量施肥，产量提高了，地质自然也提高了，于是又出现了新的矛盾：地质提高后，土地所有者就不满意原订的标准产量，要求提高产量或退组单干。如：崔太洙的土地，自报一千六百斤，实收三千一百二十斤，他要求一九五一年提高标准产量为三千一百二十斤；宋炳宽七亩一分水田，自报产量四千二百斤，实收六千二百四十斤，他提出退组自种。这个矛盾如不解决，直接打击了劳动者的热情，互助组发生有解体的危险，经过群众很长时间的讨论研究，最后决定必须土地入股。
    讨论如何入股时，首先遇到的是靠河地，山坡地要不要，因为靠河地不断被河水吞蚀；山坡地不断被雨水冲洗，不久以后不是被冲没了，就是被冲得不能种了。大家想：要这种土地入股是白白吃亏。但讨论结果，大家的结论是：“地是毛主席给的，毛主席不给地，我们哪来的地；为了大家有饭吃，这些地一定要。”金时龙同志又提议在河边植树护堤，山坡植果树以避免损失（一九五一年已植四五○株）。结果通过了河边地和山坡地也准入股的决定。
    其次是退股问题。为保持大块耕地面积，不致因退股而在中间挖去一块，决定退股时退钱不退地
    （这种规定与自愿原则不合——调查者）。
    第三、是作价问题。为争取生产合作社不解体，土地作价是较低的，原则上是依照原地一年的产量计算（一般水田六十万，旱田三十万，低于市价四、五倍）。
    第四、是果实的分配问题。订出常年标准产量，在产量内，按纯收益分配。劳动者得百分之七十，土地得百分之三十；超过部分劳动者得百分之五十，公积金百分之五十。
    第五、烈属军属代耕土地入股、果实分配问题。除土地应得标准产量内的百分之三十外，按照代耕所需工数，同样取得劳动者的百分之七十和超额部分中劳动者应得的百分之五十。
    农业生产合作社的优越性
    1、产量提高了。
    土地入股生产合作社、一般互助组、单干户一九五一年的产量如下：名称　水田一垧产量　旱田一垧产量金时龙农业生产合作社　　七、七三○斤　五、三六○斤（特产在内）互助组　七、六○○斤　二、○一五斤宋炳宽单干户　二、四六八斤　一、八九二斤
    2、地界打开后，土地面积增加了，十六垧水田就增加了七亩。
    3、可以合理调剂使用土地，和种植特种作物。该社种烟叶二垧（单干户劳动力不够不能种），收入三千万元。
    4、可以根据需要施肥，提高地质。
    5、铲除了自私心。现在放水等可以交一个人作了，过去一人作大家不放心。
    6、可以使用新式农具和试用新的耕作方法，不怕失败了没粮吃。
    7、有了公积金，可以照顾军属、妇女（产前后休息三个月的工资）、子弟入学（除本村小学经费外，社员中有十三个子弟在延吉中学读书，过去每人每月需粮五斗，现由一妇女前往帮助煮饭，每月三斗即可），还可以建立托儿所，增加妇女劳动时间。
    8、加强了和供销合作社的联系。推销产品、购买生产工具和日用品都和供销合作社订立合同。
    9、可以有计划地经营副业。
    宋炳宽单干吃了亏
    宋炳宽曾脱离过互助组，在自己的小块土地上试验了一下，不久又回互助组来了。
    宋炳宽一九四七年就参加了互助组，他有旱田一垧八亩八分，水田七亩一分，一牛，一车，男女劳动力各一。他为什么要脱离互助组呢？据他自己说：“一九四九年每平方公尺实产量调查时，计算我的七亩一分水田的产量，可达六千三百斤；实行产量保证制时，自报并公议为四千二百斤，但实产是六千二百四十斤（这是集体劳动和大量施肥的结果），我想，自己劳动力也够用，同时又有几个孩子念书，开支也大，自己种多收点不更好吗？所以就退组单干了。”他在退出互助组时曾向崔承天说：“我单干要赛过互助组。”单干的结果呢？他说：“少收和误工等损失虽然没有详细计算，最低不少于两千斤大米。”而且：“忙的时候，起早贪黑，比在组里劳动强度大，还干不好。闲的时候呢？不但无力搞副业，也不能真正休息，还得自己放牛打柴。”为什么呢？他说：“过去农忙时互助组有专门的老人看孩子；现在单干不行，老婆要看孩子，根本不能参加劳动。在组里放水放牛都是交一个人专管，现在都要自己干，占去很多劳动时间。”“组里的稻子都是正条揷秧，我一人连一般揷秧都办不到，只好散播；草也只拔了一次，很多草比稻子还高；组里旱田铲完二遍时，我一遍还没有完。在拉地时一个人既不好装车也没法捆紧，拉的次数既多，损失也大。”最后他说：“这都不讲了！我最难过的是：今年十月间延吉造纸厂收稻草，每捆出价三百四十元，当时单干户谁也割不下来；但金时龙生产合作社突击了四万捆，每户分得六十多万元。现在每捆只值一百五十元了，还不好卖。我想，如果我不退出，这六十多万元怎么也有我一份！现在是白白地丢了。这件事在我心里怎么也放不下去。”经过事实的教育，他又向互助组申请入组了，并向大家进行了检讨。检讨时第一句就说：“我对不起毛主席。”接着他说：“毛主席号召我们组织起来，我不听他的话，我吃亏了。”在具体检讨了一些实际问题之后，他宣誓：“从现在起，死也不再脱离互助组了。”
    金时龙组为什么能发展成
    合作社
    金时龙互助组能发展到今天这样较高级形式，是由这些条件决定的：
    1、党的领导强，组内问题都先提请支部讨论，然后再由党员带回组内讨论（支部任务也明确：一、作好生产；二、作好供销合作社）。大的问题并提交村人民代表会议讨论和主动向上级请示。
    2、以民主方式启发群众，完全在群众自觉自愿的情况下稳步前进。有些群众经多方启发仍不能觉悟时，他们能耐心地等待，现在还容许三户不愿土地入股者一样参加互助。
    3、社员觉悟高，他们认为土地入股是为了给走向社会主义准备条件，他们看到了光明的远景。
    4、金时龙同志个人作风好，觉悟高。他说：“搞好互助组，是完成党给我的任务。”“这些工作，都是给社会主义打基础。”他能不断地发现问题，解决问题。金时龙合作社的主要缺点
    最大的缺点是副业没搞好，养鸡、养羊、喂猪、养马都因为“侍弄”不得法，病死的不少，有的赔钱卖掉。另外用三千万元巨款修了一个很漂亮但不能立刻利用的托儿所，在目前看是个浪费，影响了副业资金的周转。
    另外一个缺点是对积肥和节约注意不够，猪鸡遍地跑，稻粒遍地洒，元子二号稻子被猪鸡吃啄竟没人过问。
    金时龙农业生产合作社是今天农业生产中较高级的形式。为了巩固和提高这样的合作社，领导方面要从各方面给他们以帮助，特别是技术方面的帮助。要使他们认真地搞好副业，并且进一步提高产量，增加收入，才能把这种形式巩固起来。
