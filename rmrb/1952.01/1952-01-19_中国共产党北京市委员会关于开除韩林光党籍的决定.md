    The Decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on Expelling Han Linguang from the Party
    Han Linguang is currently the District Head of the Seventh District People's Government of Beijing and Deputy Secretary of the Seventh District Committee of the Communist Party of China, originally from Nanle County, Pingyuan Province, and of wealthy middle-peasant background. He joined the Party in 1938.
    Although Han Linguang has participated in the revolution for more than ten years and has undergone education through rectification and party consolidation, he has still not been transformed. As early as 1948, he was disciplined by the Party for his corrupt lifestyle, seeking personal gain under the guise of public service by acquiring the fruits of farmers' struggles at low prices, and failing to implement Party resolutions. After entering the city, not only did he not repent, but he was captured by bourgeois corrupt ideology and eventually degenerated into a corrupt and degenerate element. Since 1949, Han Linguang has repeatedly used his position and power to engage in corruption. He once embezzled public funds amounting to approximately 1,800 jin of millet (only returning approximately 600 jin of millet), colluded with private merchants under the guise of "organ production," and unreasonably received a total of 3,900 jin of millet for childcare and nanny fees, most of which was spent for personal extravagance. Most seriously, he embezzled relief grain for the families of cadres. From August 1950 to mid-November 1951 alone, he embezzled and squandered approximately 3 million yuan worth of relief grain for the district government's cadre families, while only two cadre families received subsidies totaling 410,000 yuan from this fund. Under Han Linguang's leadership, the district government's financial expenditures were chaotic, with false accounts being created, underreporting being done, social relief grain being misappropriated, and even troop comforting funds being deducted.
    During the great anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Han Linguang, as the Deputy Director of the District Thrift Inspection Committee, not only failed to actively lead this movement but also arranged for cadres to cover up his mistakes, attempting to deceive and deny. Despite repeated criticism and education from the Municipal and District Committees, he showed no remorse. Even during his suspension for self-reflection, he still refused to confess and even burned letters.
    These facts fully demonstrate that Han Linguang's character is extremely depraved. His thinking has not only been eroded by bourgeois ideology, but he has also become bourgeois to the point of seeking the fruits of farmers' land reform struggles and plundering surplus value. Han Linguang has completely lost the basic qualifications of a Communist Party member. In order to purify the Party organization and enforce Party discipline, it is hereby decided to expel Han Linguang from the Party.

    中国共产党北京市委员会关于开除韩林光党籍的决定
    韩林光现任北京市第七区人民政府区长，中共北京市第七区委员会副书记，是平原省南乐县人，富裕中农出身，在一九三八年入党。
    韩林光虽然参加革命十多年，经过整风、整党的教育，但仍未得到改造。一九四八年即因生活腐化、假公济私以低价套取农民斗争果实，不执行党的决议，受过党的处分。入城以后，不但没有悔改，反而被资产阶级腐化思想所俘掳，终于堕落为贪污蜕化分子。从一九四九年以来，韩林光即一再利用职权，进行贪污。他曾经挪用公款约合一千八百斤小米（只归还了约六百斤小米），假借“机关生产”名义勾结私商做生意；不合理地先后领取小孩保育费、褓姆费三千九百斤小米，大部分供个人挥霍。最严重的是侵吞干部家属救济粮，仅在一九五○年八月至一九五一年十一月中，即贪污、挥霍区政府家属救济粮折款三百万元左右，同时干部家属从这笔款内获得补助的仅有两人共领四十一万元。而在韩林光的主持下，区政府经费开支混乱不堪，造假账，以少报多，挪用社会救济粮，甚至克扣劳军款项。
    在伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，韩林光身为区节约检查委员会副主任，不但不积极领导这一运动，反而布置干部为其掩盖错误，妄图蒙混抵赖。经过市委、区委一再批评教育，也毫不悔悟。甚至在停职反省期间，仍然拒不坦白，并烧毁信件。
    这些事实，充分说明韩林光的品质恶劣已极，他的思想不仅受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，而且资产阶级化到套取农民土地改革斗争果实和掠夺剩余价值了。韩林光已完全丧失了一个共产党员的起码条件。为了纯洁党的组织，严肃党的纪律，特决定开除韩林光的党籍。
    中国共产党北京市委员会
    一九五二年一月十五日
